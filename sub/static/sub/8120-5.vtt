00:02.080 --> 00:10.080
This programme contains some
strong language and adult humour.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.560
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Mrs Brown's Boys.

00:15.560 --> 00:18.440
# She's Mrs Brown
Agnes

00:18.440 --> 00:21.440
# That's Mrs Brown
Agnes

00:21.440 --> 00:23.080
# Oh, Mrs Brown. #

00:27.640 --> 00:30.880
Sharon has the day off.
Just sitting over there.

00:30.880 --> 00:32.240
Says she's bored.

00:32.240 --> 00:35.280
Huh! In my day we didn't
know what the word bored meant.

00:35.280 --> 00:37.080
Couldn't afford a dictionary?

00:47.280 --> 00:48.720
Where did you get that?

00:48.720 --> 00:50.040
Sharon got it.

00:50.040 --> 00:53.880
I'm doing me hall up and I thought
I might find nice colours in there.

00:56.280 --> 00:57.680
The only colour you'll

00:57.680 --> 00:59.080
find in there is blue.

00:59.080 --> 01:00.360
That's all about sex.

01:02.040 --> 01:05.040
Agnes, do you ever think about sex?

01:05.040 --> 01:08.000
No, I'm way past that, Winnie.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.560
My legs have been together now
longer than the Rolling Stones.

01:12.600 --> 01:14.440
Yeah, with the big lips.

01:19.680 --> 01:22.920
Agnes, what if the Hokey Cokey
is what it's all about?

01:27.520 --> 01:30.040
Do you know, Winnie,
everybody needs a friend like you.

01:30.040 --> 01:34.120
Ah, Agnes. We'll be friends
until we're old and senile.

01:34.120 --> 01:37.560
That's right, Winnie.
Then every day we'll be new friends.

01:42.160 --> 01:45.840
Ah, hello, Mrs McGoogan.
Oh, I like the book.

01:45.840 --> 01:48.640
I believe that's a real,
"Get up there, Nelly," book?

01:48.640 --> 01:51.320
I'd better get over
and say, "Get up there, Sharon."

01:51.320 --> 01:52.520
See you, Agnes.

01:52.520 --> 01:54.400
See you, Winnie.

01:54.400 --> 01:56.680
So what do you want?
Dermot told me to meet him here.

01:56.680 --> 01:59.160
He said he might have some work
for me. What's in the box?

01:59.160 --> 02:02.520
It wouldn't be my
new kitchen, would it?

02:04.040 --> 02:05.080
No.

02:08.120 --> 02:11.360
It's a new phone.
Dermot's looking for a smartphone.

02:11.360 --> 02:12.640
Top of the range.

02:12.640 --> 02:14.800
Why have you got
the black tape on the sides of it?

02:14.800 --> 02:17.360
Oh, I have to cover up the name.
It's BBC rules.

02:19.680 --> 02:22.920
But it's very obvious from the box
that it's an iPhone 4S.

02:26.960 --> 02:30.600
Buster, are you trying to unload
stolen goods on my son?

02:30.600 --> 02:31.920
Would I do that?

02:31.920 --> 02:34.960
Yes. Mrs Brown, that's very hurtful.

02:34.960 --> 02:37.720
I have feelings, I'm not a rock.

02:37.720 --> 02:39.600
You're not even a feckin' pebble.

02:41.360 --> 02:43.240
Buster, did you ever have a job?

02:43.240 --> 02:46.200
I mean a real job, a REAL job?

02:46.200 --> 02:47.800
Yeah, I was store security.

02:50.040 --> 02:54.240
You know, looking out for shoplifters
down at McCullagh Pickets.

02:54.240 --> 02:56.400
Who sell grand pianos.

02:56.400 --> 02:57.840
I know, it was a handy job.

02:59.040 --> 03:00.120
Why did you leave?

03:00.120 --> 03:02.360
I couldn't work for that man
after what he said to me.

03:02.360 --> 03:03.840
Why, son, what did he say to you?

03:03.840 --> 03:05.080
You're fired.

03:10.840 --> 03:13.680
I could smell you
before I'd seen you.

03:13.680 --> 03:16.240
That's the first time
I've heard that today.

03:16.240 --> 03:18.240
Here, the one you were looking for.

03:18.240 --> 03:20.520
Just put your SIM card in there
and it's ready to go.

03:20.520 --> 03:22.600
Brilliant. Thanks, Buster.

03:22.600 --> 03:24.320
Dermot, is that above board?

03:24.320 --> 03:25.880
Mammy, will you stop worrying?

03:25.880 --> 03:28.440
With that fecker involved,
I'd always worry.

03:30.040 --> 03:32.080
So, Buster,
do you fancy doing a bit of work?

03:32.080 --> 03:33.400
Yeah, sure, when?

03:33.400 --> 03:35.960
Now, let's get down to the office,
get kitted out.

03:35.960 --> 03:39.000
If I'm an air freshener,
I want to be vanilla.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.440
Shut up, Buster. See you, Ma.

03:41.440 --> 03:42.480
Good luck.

03:44.320 --> 03:45.720
Hello there.

03:45.720 --> 03:50.520
Well, as you can see,
I'm still waiting on my new kitchen.

03:50.520 --> 03:53.960
I don't know what's wrong with me
today? I feel uneasy.

03:53.960 --> 03:55.360
Do you know that feeling you get

03:55.360 --> 03:58.120
when you just know something is
going to happen?

03:59.400 --> 04:02.480
Rory and Dino have moved in together
into a new apartment.

04:02.480 --> 04:05.200
Oh, they seem blissfully happy.

04:05.200 --> 04:07.520
HE SOBS

04:10.000 --> 04:11.880
Though I could be fuckin' wrong.

04:13.480 --> 04:15.960
Rory, what's wrong? Sit down.

04:18.320 --> 04:20.960
What happened, did you break a nail?

04:20.960 --> 04:25.440
Come on, Rory, don't be getting
upset. Tell us what's wrong?

04:25.440 --> 04:27.280
Is it you and Dino?

04:27.280 --> 04:30.280
What happened?
Did he cut your fuckin' tongue out?

04:31.320 --> 04:32.880
Mammy!

04:32.880 --> 04:36.840
Well, what's the point in educating
a child if he speaks to you with...

04:36.840 --> 04:38.480
Speak!

04:41.040 --> 04:43.960
Mammy, can I stay
here for a couple of days?

04:43.960 --> 04:47.960
My apartment is ruined.
I'll have to get new carpets and all.

04:47.960 --> 04:49.840
Why, love, what happened?

04:49.840 --> 04:51.840
Me and Dino had a row.

04:51.840 --> 04:53.280
Oh, for God's sake.

04:53.280 --> 04:55.680
I walked out
and when I came back he was gone

04:55.680 --> 04:58.000
and he'd destroyed the apartment.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.440
Destroyed it?

04:59.440 --> 05:02.080
He even pulled
the radiator off the wall.

05:02.080 --> 05:04.080
The whole place was flooded.

05:04.080 --> 05:06.560
Mark is over there now
trying to fix it.

05:06.560 --> 05:08.680
But I have to get new carpets.

05:08.680 --> 05:09.800
Well, a row is one thing

05:09.800 --> 05:12.800
but there's no need for
that kind of violence.

05:12.800 --> 05:15.280
Rory, love,
of course you can stay here.

05:15.280 --> 05:17.280
You go up
and have a nice hot bath, love,

05:17.280 --> 05:21.000
put some Fairy liquid in it,
make it nice and bubbly.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.640
I'll make you a cup of tea, love.

05:22.640 --> 05:24.640
Thanks, Mammy. All right.

05:25.720 --> 05:27.440
What the hell is Dino playing at?

05:27.440 --> 05:30.200
I don't know? Poor Rory.

05:30.200 --> 05:32.800
And when I see him,
poor fuckin' Dino!

05:36.240 --> 05:40.480
OK, Mr Campbell, I'll tell her
when she comes in. Bye.

05:42.640 --> 05:44.160
Hi, you two.

05:44.160 --> 05:46.880
Hiya, Cathy. Is your mother
home from the market yet?

05:46.880 --> 05:49.840
Not yet, any minute though.
We'll call back later, so...

05:49.840 --> 05:54.520
No, Mark, we're waiting. Putting
it off won't make it any easier.

05:54.520 --> 05:57.080
This came in this morning.

05:57.080 --> 05:59.360
We've been granted our visas
for Australia.

05:59.360 --> 06:01.880
Oh, that's fantastic!
Congratulations!

06:01.880 --> 06:04.600
Yeah, great. Right, we'll go then.

06:04.600 --> 06:06.320
Cathy, will you tell Mammy, so?

06:08.040 --> 06:10.000
Stop it, Mark, we're waiting.

06:11.400 --> 06:15.000
Hello, you two.
What brings you here so early?

06:15.000 --> 06:17.600
Mark, why don't you go
in the sitting room with your mother

06:17.600 --> 06:20.160
for a private chat? Come on, Ma.

06:20.160 --> 06:22.360
It's not my book,
I just got a lend of it.

06:25.800 --> 06:29.400
Oh, God,
she's been dreading this day.

06:29.400 --> 06:32.040
I know. Cathy,
can you do me a favour?

06:32.040 --> 06:34.720
If I can.
Do you have a printer at work?

06:34.720 --> 06:36.400
Yeah, sure.

06:36.400 --> 06:38.800
What is it, Mark?
Is it something about Bono?

06:38.800 --> 06:39.840
No, Ma, Bono's fine.

06:39.840 --> 06:42.280
Thank God, I thought you were
going to give me bad news...

06:42.280 --> 06:46.040
Mammy, I got my visa for Australia.
We all did.

06:46.040 --> 06:47.880
Myself, Betty and Bono.

06:48.880 --> 06:50.880
We can go within the next six weeks.

06:52.480 --> 06:54.120
Wonderful.

06:54.120 --> 06:55.800
Congratulations.

06:55.800 --> 06:58.200
A new life, a new beginning.

06:58.200 --> 07:00.160
It's fantastic.

07:00.160 --> 07:02.160
Cathy, did they tell you?

07:02.160 --> 07:04.360
They got them,
the visas for Australia.

07:04.360 --> 07:07.880
They got them. Congratulations.

07:07.880 --> 07:10.080
Jesus, Ma, I thought you'd be upset.

07:10.080 --> 07:12.720
Well, I'm not going to say I'd
be thrilled to see you going

07:12.720 --> 07:15.960
but you have to do whatever's
right for your family.

07:15.960 --> 07:18.440
I'm delighted for yous,
both of yous.

07:18.440 --> 07:21.480
Especially you, Betty,
cos I know it was all your idea.

07:22.960 --> 07:25.680
We should be going.
Thanks for doing that, Cathy.

07:25.680 --> 07:27.600
No problem, Betty, I'll get it done.

07:27.600 --> 07:29.360
I suppose you'll want to
start packing?

07:29.360 --> 07:30.840
I've already started.

07:30.840 --> 07:32.800
Of course you have.

07:32.800 --> 07:34.720
Mammy,
there was a phone call for you.

07:34.720 --> 07:38.240
A Mr Campbell,
Kirby & Campbell Solicitors.

07:38.240 --> 07:41.240
Oh, all right.
Solicitors? What's that about?

07:41.240 --> 07:42.560
Nothing. Nothing important.

07:42.560 --> 07:44.080
PHONE RINGS
I'll get that!

07:46.800 --> 07:49.360
Hello? How do you do?

07:49.360 --> 07:51.880
Hello, Mr Campbell. Yes, I...

07:53.720 --> 07:55.440
Just one moment, please.

08:06.360 --> 08:07.640
TOGETHER: Uh-oh.

08:16.120 --> 08:17.760
PHONE RINGS

08:17.760 --> 08:20.000
I'll get that.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.480
Cathy, answer that
glistening love rod.

08:25.520 --> 08:29.360
Hello? Yes, this is Cathy Brown.

08:30.600 --> 08:33.080
Oh, thanks for calling me back.

08:33.080 --> 08:36.400
I was looking for some information
on a solicitors company,

08:36.400 --> 08:37.560
Kirby & Campbell?

08:39.520 --> 08:41.760
I was wondering what it is
they specialise in?

08:41.760 --> 08:43.200
DOORBELL

08:43.200 --> 08:44.240
Door, Mammy.

09:01.200 --> 09:05.200
Well, if it isn't the bally
bunion butcher! Come in.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.840
You have a cheek calling over here.

09:11.840 --> 09:12.960
Is Rory here?

09:12.960 --> 09:15.400
He's upstairs but I don't think
he wants to speak to you.

09:15.400 --> 09:17.080
I just want to apologise.

09:17.080 --> 09:19.480
I don't think an apology
will cut it this time, Dino.

09:19.480 --> 09:20.520
Oh!

09:23.320 --> 09:24.960
How could you be so rough?

09:24.960 --> 09:26.000
Oh!

09:28.760 --> 09:30.320
My Rory is such a gentle soul.

09:30.320 --> 09:31.360
Oh!

09:33.520 --> 09:35.440
There's no need for that vandalism.

09:35.440 --> 09:37.160
Vandalism? Vandalism!

09:37.160 --> 09:40.160
Vandalism? Vandalism!
I did nothing like that!

09:40.160 --> 09:43.040
Liar! You pulled the radiator
off the wall,

09:43.040 --> 09:45.000
you flooded the whole
feckin' apartment!

09:45.000 --> 09:47.080
I had to! You had to?

09:47.080 --> 09:49.160
Aye, he had me handcuffed to it.

09:58.280 --> 09:59.680
What the hell happened?

10:00.960 --> 10:02.360
I think I've killed her.

10:03.920 --> 10:06.160
She's fine. Oh, no!

10:13.000 --> 10:14.720
What's wrong, Cathy?

10:14.720 --> 10:15.840
Mammy fainted.

10:15.840 --> 10:19.400
No, Cathy, no, you look pale.
Mammy's fainted before.

10:22.080 --> 10:24.560
I just found out about
the solicitors

10:24.560 --> 10:25.880
who have been calling Mammy.

10:25.880 --> 10:29.080
What about them?
They specialise in adoptions.

10:29.080 --> 10:30.320
GROANING

10:33.480 --> 10:35.560
Dermot, she's awake.

10:39.400 --> 10:40.800
Are you all right, Mammy?

10:47.800 --> 10:50.400
Adoptions? These solicitors
Kirby & Campbell,

10:50.400 --> 10:51.840
they arrange adoptions?

10:51.840 --> 10:53.960
No, they track down adopted
children

10:53.960 --> 10:56.360
from mothers who put them
up for adoption years ago.

10:56.360 --> 10:57.480
What does that mean?

10:57.480 --> 10:59.720
That means that one of us
could be adopted.

10:59.720 --> 11:02.360
Surely your mother would have
told you? Wouldn't she?

11:02.360 --> 11:04.440
No!

11:04.440 --> 11:06.320
So which one of yous then?

11:06.320 --> 11:09.880
I suppose whichever one of us
is the most different to the rest?

11:11.360 --> 11:12.400
Hiya.

11:15.040 --> 11:17.040
What?

11:17.040 --> 11:20.320
Come on, Betty, we'd better get
out of here before Mammy comes back.

11:20.320 --> 11:22.480
She'll know
we were talking about her.

11:22.480 --> 11:24.640
Yeah, us too.

11:24.640 --> 11:27.360
Come on, Dermot Brown or

11:27.360 --> 11:29.160
whoever you really are.

11:29.160 --> 11:32.360
Maria, that's not
even a little bit funny.

11:32.360 --> 11:33.720
What's going on, Dermot?

11:33.720 --> 11:34.960
Cathy'll fill you in.

11:36.240 --> 11:38.040
For God's sake, Cathy, what is it?

11:38.040 --> 11:40.360
We think one of us is adopted.

11:40.360 --> 11:44.840
I knew it!
I was born into a real rich family.

11:44.840 --> 11:47.280
And yous bastards kidnapped me!

11:49.360 --> 11:52.840
DOORBELL
For God's sake, Rory!

11:52.840 --> 11:54.680
Does everything have to be a drama?

12:00.240 --> 12:01.360
Hello, Cathy.

12:01.360 --> 12:04.560
EASTENDERS DRUMS

12:17.640 --> 12:22.200
So you see, Cathy, I wasn't a married
man just using you for a fling.

12:23.200 --> 12:25.360
I've been divorced a long time ago.

12:25.360 --> 12:27.400
But why didn't you just say that?

12:29.200 --> 12:32.720
I wanted to, but neither you
nor your mother gave me a chance.

12:32.720 --> 12:36.520
Dermot's phone.
I bet that's feckin' stolen.

12:36.520 --> 12:39.040
Mammy, look who's here.

12:39.040 --> 12:40.320
Detective Mick.

12:42.760 --> 12:44.360
Lets go in and say hello.

12:44.360 --> 12:45.880
DOORBELL

12:45.880 --> 12:47.120
I'll get it.

12:51.600 --> 12:53.120
Hello, Mrs Brown.

12:53.120 --> 12:54.280
I hope you have a warrant.

12:54.280 --> 12:57.120
You can't just walk in here
looking for stolen phones.

12:57.120 --> 13:00.000
No, no, I'm not here on
official business.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.600
Stolen phones? What?
You said stolen phones.

13:02.600 --> 13:05.000
Who did? You did, just now.
You said stolen phones.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.120
What? Mammy, Father Quinn is back.
Isn't that fantastic?

13:08.120 --> 13:11.320
Oh, fantastic! Hello, Father Quinn.

13:11.320 --> 13:12.560
Come in! Come in!

13:14.200 --> 13:18.000
Let's go for a drink, Mick.
I want to hear the whole story.

13:25.040 --> 13:27.560
Now, Father, welcome back.

13:28.560 --> 13:30.840
How did reha...your holiday go?

13:32.960 --> 13:35.760
Sufficient to say that
I had a good rest, Mrs Brown.

13:35.760 --> 13:38.320
That's fantastic. Do you want
me to pour you a drop? No!

13:38.320 --> 13:41.520
I mean, no thank you, Mrs Brown.

13:41.520 --> 13:43.560
It's just great to have him back,
Mrs Brown.

13:43.560 --> 13:45.480
The hospital say it was
all caused by...

13:45.480 --> 13:47.160
You!

13:47.160 --> 13:49.320
Stress, Father. They said stress.

13:49.320 --> 13:52.040
Ah. Well, the drink
couldn't have helped!

13:54.400 --> 13:56.240
I'm attending meetings now

13:56.240 --> 14:01.080
and one of the recommendations
is that I am to confront my demons.

14:01.080 --> 14:03.760
So, I'm here.

14:09.120 --> 14:11.000
Well, what can I do for you, Father?

14:11.000 --> 14:13.680
Oh, yes. Well... Allow me, Father.

14:13.680 --> 14:17.600
Mrs Brown, as you may know
Father Quinn's annual garden party

14:17.600 --> 14:18.840
is coming up shortly.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.280
Where's me phone?

14:22.480 --> 14:25.120
Do you want me to ring it?
Yeah, will you?

14:28.000 --> 14:31.400
The garden party is a major
fundraiser for meals on wheels.

14:31.400 --> 14:32.760
PHONE VIBRATES

14:37.720 --> 14:41.200
But it will also be my first event
since I came back.

14:41.200 --> 14:43.120
PHONE VIBRATES

14:43.120 --> 14:44.600
And the Father's counsellor

14:44.600 --> 14:46.800
suggested that he invite you
along to help.

14:46.800 --> 14:49.080
Sort of a re-baptism of fire
so to speak.

14:49.080 --> 14:50.560
PHONE VIBRATES

14:51.640 --> 14:53.360
Hot! Hot fire!

14:54.360 --> 14:58.120
And indeed it is a very important
gathering for the entire community.

14:58.120 --> 14:59.560
PHONE VIBRATES

15:00.800 --> 15:04.520
It gives friends and neighbours
a chance to keep in touch.

15:04.520 --> 15:05.960
PHONE VIBRATES

15:05.960 --> 15:08.320
Touch! Touch! Oh, touch!

15:09.520 --> 15:11.000
PHONE VIBRATES

15:13.680 --> 15:16.000
It was ringing.
Maybe you left it in the car.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.560
No, I walked here! Ring it again.

15:21.000 --> 15:25.120
Look, Father, I know how important
Father Quinn's garden party is...

15:25.120 --> 15:27.760
PHONE VIBRATES

15:27.760 --> 15:29.200
I'll get to the point.

15:29.200 --> 15:30.880
I need volunteers on the day

15:30.880 --> 15:33.720
to help me give the parishioners
a great day out.

15:33.720 --> 15:37.640
Now, I would never usually ask you...

15:39.280 --> 15:42.240
Mrs Brown, will you come along
and help?

15:42.240 --> 15:44.600
Come along! Come along!

15:46.120 --> 15:48.360
This was a mistake,
give me that bottle.

15:48.360 --> 15:51.120
No, Father, you mustn't!
Just wait, Father.

15:51.120 --> 15:52.480
Mrs Brown, will you be coming?

15:52.480 --> 15:55.640
PHONE VIBRATES

15:57.600 --> 16:02.440
Yes! Yes! Yes!

16:04.280 --> 16:05.600
Yes!

16:18.560 --> 16:20.360
You look in good form.

16:20.360 --> 16:21.400
I am.

16:22.680 --> 16:25.120
It's been a strange day.
Oh, me too.

16:25.120 --> 16:27.560
I had Father Quinn
and Father Damien call

16:27.560 --> 16:30.680
asking me to volunteer to
help at the garden party.

16:30.680 --> 16:32.320
They can feck off, Agnes!

16:32.320 --> 16:35.040
Eight hours on my feet in the cold.

16:35.040 --> 16:38.080
They asked me too. I volunteered.

16:38.080 --> 16:41.160
What? Ah, they
must have seen you coming.

16:48.680 --> 16:51.080
It's only one day.

16:51.080 --> 16:52.440
Somebody has to do it.

16:52.440 --> 16:54.200
Well, I suppose.

16:54.200 --> 16:57.640
Here, I see Mick the Dick is
back on the scene.

16:59.120 --> 17:00.840
He dropped in out of the blue.

17:00.840 --> 17:05.880
Cathy said he explained everything
and now, oh, he's so sensitive(!)

17:05.880 --> 17:08.680
Aren't they all.
Especially around the top.

17:13.520 --> 17:15.160
Emotionally.

17:17.760 --> 17:19.760
My Redser had only two emotions.

17:19.760 --> 17:20.960
Horny and hungry.

17:22.600 --> 17:25.560
Every time he got an erection
I made him a sandwich.

17:27.320 --> 17:28.960
Here, same again, pet?

17:28.960 --> 17:30.000
Yes, love.

17:32.920 --> 17:36.000
You know, Rory, I'm so
sorry we even had that fight.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.360
I am too.

17:37.360 --> 17:41.160
I woke up and you weren't beside me
and I didn't like it.

17:41.160 --> 17:43.520
Well, I'll be there tomorrow,
so don't you worry.

17:43.520 --> 17:47.080
I'd much prefer it if you were
legally obliged to be there.

17:49.880 --> 17:52.880
Dino Doyle, are you proposing to me?

17:57.760 --> 17:59.000
Hiya, Ma.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.600
Hello, son.

18:00.600 --> 18:01.920
Ma, can I ask you something?

18:01.920 --> 18:03.280
Sure.

18:03.280 --> 18:04.720
Do I look like Daddy?

18:04.720 --> 18:05.840
Jesus, no, not a bit.

18:09.840 --> 18:12.680
Your father used to take you
out for a walk and people used to go

18:12.680 --> 18:13.920
"Oh, is he adopted?"

18:16.160 --> 18:17.200
Adopted? Yes!

18:18.960 --> 18:21.560
No, love, no, you're
the image of my father.

18:21.560 --> 18:25.320
Really? Oh, yes, son.
You're the spit of him.

18:25.320 --> 18:26.840
I knew it the day you were born.

18:26.840 --> 18:29.800
I held you up, I even put
a fag in your mouth to be sure.

18:31.240 --> 18:32.520
See you later, Ma.

18:35.560 --> 18:38.000
Cathy, it's not me. I'm not adopted.

18:41.400 --> 18:43.880
Mammy, I have some
amazing news for you.

18:43.880 --> 18:45.040
What, Rory?

18:45.040 --> 18:46.280
I'm getting married.

18:51.440 --> 18:54.720
Are you sure? I mean, Rory,
have you thought this through?

18:54.720 --> 18:55.880
Yes, Mammy.

18:55.880 --> 18:58.880
I've never been more sure
of anything in my whole life.

18:58.880 --> 19:00.920
Oh, well then I'm delighted for you.

19:00.920 --> 19:01.960
Ah, thanks, Mammy!

19:04.240 --> 19:07.440
There you go, pet.
What's up with Rory?

19:07.440 --> 19:09.320
He's getting married.

19:09.320 --> 19:12.640
That's fantastic. Are you delighted?

19:12.640 --> 19:14.160
Kind of.

19:14.160 --> 19:17.000
I'm dreading what will
happen when he tells Dino.

19:19.600 --> 19:22.400
Crisps! Ah, shite.

19:29.560 --> 19:32.000
This is your life.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.160
What's that?

19:33.160 --> 19:36.920
It's my photo album, Mammy.
I was just looking through it.

19:36.920 --> 19:39.520
And do you know what I noticed
when I was looking at this?

19:39.520 --> 19:42.160
There are no baby photos of me.
Really?

19:42.160 --> 19:45.000
None at all. None? Not even one.

19:45.000 --> 19:46.480
Jesus, that's odd.

19:46.480 --> 19:47.960
Now, why would that be?

19:49.000 --> 19:50.600
Maybe you were an ugly baby?

19:52.400 --> 19:54.240
I'm only joking.

19:54.240 --> 19:56.920
Do you know,
I'm a shocking mother, Cathy.

19:56.920 --> 19:58.880
You were my
fourth child in four years.

19:58.880 --> 20:01.080
I was in labour longer than
feckin' Harold Wilson!

20:03.640 --> 20:06.240
I had a house full of kids,
a house full of shitty nappies

20:06.240 --> 20:07.760
and an alcoholic husband.

20:07.760 --> 20:11.400
Why wasn't I running around going
"Where's my fuckin' camera?"

20:13.280 --> 20:16.200
Sometimes I don't feel
I'm part of this family.

20:16.200 --> 20:19.040
And sometimes you
act like you're not.

20:21.600 --> 20:23.960
"'What's your name,' he said.

20:23.960 --> 20:25.640
"'Mmph, mmph, mmph,' she said."

20:29.680 --> 20:31.840
They all lived happily ever after.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.040
Hello, Granny.

20:35.040 --> 20:39.640
Hello, Bono. Look at you, big boy,
all dressed up for school.

20:39.640 --> 20:41.400
Guess what? What?

20:41.400 --> 20:43.080
I'm not going to Australia.

20:43.080 --> 20:44.560
Oh, Bono, don't start that again.

20:44.560 --> 20:47.280
You are going. You have to go
with your Mammy and your Daddy.

20:47.280 --> 20:50.000
What would they do in Australia
without you?

20:50.000 --> 20:51.400
They're not going either.

20:51.400 --> 20:53.720
They are, son. No, we're not, Ma.

20:53.720 --> 20:56.800
What? Betty got these printed.

20:56.800 --> 20:58.480
'Mark Brown and Son, Carpenters.'

20:58.480 --> 21:00.200
I put them around the houses
in the area.

21:00.200 --> 21:03.080
And more work for Mark than he can
handle. We can afford to stay.

21:03.080 --> 21:04.240
That's fantastic!

21:04.240 --> 21:05.800
See, I told you, Granny.

21:05.800 --> 21:07.280
That's great!

21:07.280 --> 21:09.680
Can I go upstairs
and play with Grandad's teeth?

21:09.680 --> 21:11.960
Of course you can. Off you go.

21:11.960 --> 21:13.560
Yes!

21:13.560 --> 21:15.920
Here, you, you're going to school.
No time for playing.

21:15.920 --> 21:17.160
Go and wait in the car.

21:19.080 --> 21:22.960
Sorry to intrude. Today's the day
we start the kitchen.

21:22.960 --> 21:25.480
Buster, Mammy doesn't need you.

21:25.480 --> 21:26.680
I'll be doing the kitchen.

21:26.680 --> 21:28.760
But what about compensation?

21:28.760 --> 21:29.840
What about this?

21:29.840 --> 21:32.760
You go away and I wont shove that
toolbox up your... Mark!

21:34.560 --> 21:35.880
That sounds good to me.

21:37.720 --> 21:40.160
Mark, do you want to buy a toolbox?

21:40.160 --> 21:41.640
Never used.

21:41.640 --> 21:42.720
No. Fair enough.

21:44.200 --> 21:46.480
Right, we'd better go too, Ma.
See you later.

21:46.480 --> 21:48.040
See you, love. Bye, Mrs Brown.

21:48.040 --> 21:50.600
Betty.

21:50.600 --> 21:51.640
Thank you.

21:55.640 --> 21:57.760
DOORBELL RINGS

22:00.400 --> 22:04.120
They're not going to Australia!
They're not going to Australia!

22:07.000 --> 22:08.640
Hello, Dino. Come in.

22:08.640 --> 22:10.320
Thank you, Mrs Brown.

22:13.120 --> 22:15.520
I'm glad you called over, Dino.

22:15.520 --> 22:17.440
I just wanted to say how sorry I am.

22:21.120 --> 22:22.920
Sorry? About what?

22:24.040 --> 22:26.520
About Rory not being gay anymore.

22:26.520 --> 22:29.120
He's not gay? No.

22:29.120 --> 22:32.080
And I don't know if he's told you
but he's getting married.

22:32.080 --> 22:33.880
I know. To me.

22:33.880 --> 22:36.080
So what you should do now
is you need...

22:38.880 --> 22:40.440
I beg your pardon?

22:40.440 --> 22:43.880
Rory and I are getting married
to each other.

22:43.880 --> 22:45.800
I don't think you can do that, son.

22:45.800 --> 22:48.440
Oh, we can and we are.

22:48.440 --> 22:51.000
I need time to think about this.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.120
Rory's not here.

22:52.120 --> 22:54.400
I know. Actually I came to see you.

22:54.400 --> 22:57.640
Me? Mother of the bri...

22:58.800 --> 23:00.960
Mother of the groo...

23:00.960 --> 23:03.520
Rory's mother?

23:03.520 --> 23:04.680
What's on your mind?

23:04.680 --> 23:07.440
I don't know how to ask this.
It's very delicate.

23:08.680 --> 23:10.760
Dino, you're marrying my son.

23:10.760 --> 23:13.120
He handcuffs you to the radiator.

23:13.120 --> 23:14.760
You probably lick his 99.

23:17.760 --> 23:19.360
What the fuck could be delicate?

23:21.400 --> 23:22.440
I suppose.

23:23.560 --> 23:26.400
Rory is beginning
to doubt his pedigree.

23:26.400 --> 23:29.160
He has parentage concerns.

23:29.160 --> 23:30.640
Who sired him?

23:30.640 --> 23:32.640
Does he even belong to this litter?

23:33.640 --> 23:36.680
Dino, either we do this in English
or you can fuck off.

23:38.800 --> 23:40.040
Is Rory adopted?

23:40.040 --> 23:42.280
Adopted? Don't be ridiculous.

23:42.280 --> 23:45.520
Oh, thank God.
Oh, he'll be so relieved.

23:45.520 --> 23:47.480
I'm sorry if I upset you
by bringing it up.

23:47.480 --> 23:50.520
Do I look upset? Not at all, son.

23:50.520 --> 23:53.400
Actually I think it's quite sweet.

23:53.400 --> 23:56.400
Time comes when we all need
somebody to stand up for us.

23:56.400 --> 23:58.120
I'm glad Rory has you.

23:58.120 --> 23:59.920
HE MOUTHS: Thank you.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.080
SHE MOUTHS: OK.

24:05.400 --> 24:07.320
You're a good boy.

24:07.320 --> 24:09.640
Now, fuck off and
be good somewhere else.

24:12.080 --> 24:13.680
Dino?

24:13.680 --> 24:15.720
Why would Rory think he's adopted?

24:15.720 --> 24:18.640
Well, apparently Cathy and Mark
overheard you on the phone

24:18.640 --> 24:22.280
to some solicitor and they're
convinced one of them is adopted.

24:25.120 --> 24:26.680
Overheard?

24:28.480 --> 24:30.280
Serves them fuckin' right.

24:33.920 --> 24:35.680
Hiya, Mammy!

24:35.680 --> 24:37.800
Hello, love.

24:37.800 --> 24:38.840
Are you all right?

24:39.920 --> 24:41.200
Fine.

24:46.840 --> 24:49.280
I had a very interesting
conversation today

24:49.280 --> 24:50.760
with Dino about Rory.

24:50.760 --> 24:51.960
Really?

24:51.960 --> 24:55.680
You wont believe it.
Rory thought he was adopted.

24:55.680 --> 24:57.640
Oh, really?

24:57.640 --> 25:00.080
Where would
he get an idea like that?

25:00.080 --> 25:01.360
God only knows.

25:09.240 --> 25:11.640
Cathy, you're not adopted.

25:11.640 --> 25:12.800
I'm not?

25:12.800 --> 25:14.080
No, you feckin' eejit!

25:16.520 --> 25:17.880
Well, who is then?

25:17.880 --> 25:19.280
None of yous!

25:19.280 --> 25:23.200
That firm of solicitors handles
other stuff as well, you know.

25:23.200 --> 25:25.200
I didn't want to worry you and Mark.

25:26.360 --> 25:29.240
The company your father works for,

25:29.240 --> 25:32.200
they're trying to
cut his widow's pension.

25:32.200 --> 25:35.120
They said that they're having
an economic downturn.

25:35.120 --> 25:38.560
But your father died 25 years ago.
He didn't fuckin' cause it!

25:40.720 --> 25:44.240
They're representing the union,
they wanted papers. That's all.

25:44.240 --> 25:46.760
Sorry. And so you should be.

25:46.760 --> 25:48.840
Rory was terrified.

25:48.840 --> 25:50.320
And Mark too.

25:50.320 --> 25:51.840
I must talk to him.

25:51.840 --> 25:53.040
Oh, you should(!)

25:53.040 --> 25:56.440
We wouldn't want one of your sons
upset now, would we?

25:56.440 --> 25:57.680
No, we wouldn't.

25:57.680 --> 25:58.920
Excuse me, Miss!

26:00.080 --> 26:02.680
Do you believe I think more
of my boys than I do of you?

26:02.680 --> 26:04.320
I know it!

26:04.320 --> 26:06.120
Do you now?

26:06.120 --> 26:09.440
Well, let me tell you
something I know, Missy.

26:09.440 --> 26:12.040
Your son is your son
till he takes a wife.

26:12.040 --> 26:14.920
Your daughter's your daughter
all your life.

26:16.880 --> 26:17.920
Good night, Mammy.

26:19.360 --> 26:21.280
Good night.

26:23.480 --> 26:26.240
Life is all about relationships.

26:26.240 --> 26:29.000
Mark is not going to Australia,
but, if he did,

26:29.000 --> 26:32.840
would the distance between us
make him less my son? No.

26:32.840 --> 26:35.160
And Cathy has decided
to forgive Mick.

26:35.160 --> 26:38.280
Is that the right thing to do?
I don't know.

26:38.280 --> 26:40.920
Kieran, come on.

26:40.920 --> 26:42.320
Kieran on the camera.

26:43.640 --> 26:45.040
But it makes Cathy happy.

26:47.640 --> 26:48.800
Come on, dear.

26:49.880 --> 26:52.240
And what if
one of my children was adopted?

26:52.240 --> 26:53.960
What if they were all adopted?

26:53.960 --> 26:56.080
Would that make me
less their mother?

26:56.080 --> 26:57.120
No!

26:58.800 --> 27:00.840
Life is all about relationships.

27:05.160 --> 27:06.320
Mammy.

27:06.320 --> 27:08.240
Yes, love.

27:08.240 --> 27:11.600
Thanks for telling me I'm not
adopted.

27:11.600 --> 27:12.840
I was really worried.

27:14.040 --> 27:16.480
Worried about what for God's sake?

27:16.480 --> 27:18.800
Cathy, look at yourself.

27:18.800 --> 27:20.400
Who the fuck would adopt you?

27:28.600 --> 27:30.600
Good night!

27:30.600 --> 27:35.680
# Say hello
to the queen of Dublin town

27:36.760 --> 27:41.480
# As the best mum of all
she wears the crown

27:42.880 --> 27:45.840
# Mother hen watching all her chicks

27:45.840 --> 27:49.040
# Sassy old lady full of tricks

27:49.040 --> 27:54.880
# It's a safe bet she'd never let
life get her down

27:54.880 --> 27:58.120
# She's Mrs Brown
Agnes

27:58.120 --> 28:01.040
# That's Mrs Brown
Agnes

28:01.040 --> 28:03.160
# Oh, Mrs Brown. #

28:03.160 --> 28:06.200
