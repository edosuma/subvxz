00:05.070 --> 00:07.823
<i>Accessing archive data...</i>

00:08.227 --> 00:11.847
<i>The Renegade continues
to inspire the public...</i>

00:12.440 --> 00:14.542
Standing up to Tesler
showed those programs

00:14.576 --> 00:17.549
that they don't have
to sit idly by.

00:17.583 --> 00:20.388
They can choose to fight.

00:20.422 --> 00:21.823
<i>...while Beck meets someone else</i>

00:21.858 --> 00:24.595
<i>who knows that Tron is alive.</i>

00:24.630 --> 00:27.769
You're not the first program
Tron trained to fight back.

00:27.804 --> 00:29.772
I am.

00:29.807 --> 00:33.848
Surprise.
I'm the first Renegade.

01:30.662 --> 01:35.804
<i>Halt, program!
Violation penal code 113.</i>

01:52.539 --> 01:54.742
- There he is!
- No, over here!

01:55.277 --> 01:56.780
Split up.

02:03.894 --> 02:07.534
You're fast, Renegade.
But not fast enough.

02:09.841 --> 02:11.509
Wait, you're not...

02:27.861 --> 02:37.361
<b>S01E14 - Tagged</b>

02:48.097 --> 02:52.103
- My fan club strikes again.
- You mean my fan club.

02:52.137 --> 02:55.910
Hey, you made a joke.
That's progress.

02:55.945 --> 02:57.146
What did you find out?

02:57.180 --> 02:59.918
Not much. The soldiers
still think it's me.

02:59.953 --> 03:02.156
They haven't even figured out
that there's more than one.

03:02.190 --> 03:04.260
So when do we bring them in?

03:04.294 --> 03:06.064
We don't.

03:06.098 --> 03:08.736
- Not yet.
- What do you mean?

03:08.771 --> 03:11.809
This is what we've been
waiting for... recruits.

03:11.843 --> 03:13.045
We have to build ranks eventually,

03:13.080 --> 03:15.149
and they obviously
believe in the cause.

03:15.183 --> 03:18.956
There's more to the uprising
than acts of vandalism.

03:18.991 --> 03:20.459
You know that.

03:20.845 --> 03:22.647
Well, you do now.

03:22.681 --> 03:24.985
Yeah, because you gave me
the chance to do something,

03:25.020 --> 03:27.723
make a difference.
I'm not sure if you noticed,

03:27.758 --> 03:28.960
but I'm kinda on my own out there.

03:28.994 --> 03:33.670
- I'm just asking you to wait.
- I'm done waiting.

03:33.704 --> 03:35.025
As long as I'm wearing this suit,

03:35.040 --> 03:37.176
you have to start
letting me make decisions.

03:38.631 --> 03:41.602
These programs need to know
what they're fighting for.

03:41.637 --> 03:44.508
They need to be willing to die for it.

03:44.543 --> 03:47.513
You want to make a decision,
make one.

03:47.548 --> 03:49.919
But be prepared to deal
with the consequences.

03:52.558 --> 03:55.896
And you're walking away.
Big surprise.

04:08.890 --> 04:10.593
Where is it?

04:10.627 --> 04:13.599
<i>- Identify.
- I told you, I didn't see anything.</i>

04:13.633 --> 04:16.605
I want every program
on this train detained.

04:16.639 --> 04:18.774
No one leaves until
I've questioned them.

04:18.810 --> 04:19.978
Yes, sir.

04:26.626 --> 04:27.761
Well?

04:27.795 --> 04:29.832
Open it!

04:31.869 --> 04:34.006
I got it!

04:41.022 --> 04:42.758
Get down!

05:08.910 --> 05:10.779
Triumph!

05:10.814 --> 05:13.018
I wish I could've seen their
faces when the countdown hit zero.

05:13.052 --> 05:15.723
I wish I could've seen
my masterpiece.

05:16.926 --> 05:18.662
Our masterpiece.

05:18.696 --> 05:21.000
Next time let's hang
out at the scene longer.

05:21.035 --> 05:22.837
It's more fun when they chase us.

05:22.871 --> 05:24.005
That's how we get caught.

05:24.040 --> 05:26.010
If we wanna
keep this operation running,

05:26.045 --> 05:27.780
we stick to my plan.

05:31.055 --> 05:32.990
<i>- Now what?
- Run!</i>

05:53.766 --> 05:57.038
<i>Do you know how fast you could've
been derezzed for what you've done?</i>

05:57.072 --> 06:00.879
<i>Vandalizing city property,
trespassing,</i>

06:00.914 --> 06:04.620
<i>instigating disobedience
by spreading lies.</i>

06:04.655 --> 06:07.660
- They're not lies.
- Hey, be quiet.

06:07.694 --> 06:09.730
And it's not vandalism, it's free code.

06:09.765 --> 06:13.003
For the record, I have no idea

06:13.038 --> 06:16.543
what you or these two
are talking about.

06:16.578 --> 06:18.714
Hey, hey! Whoa!

06:21.722 --> 06:24.594
Oh, that.

06:24.628 --> 06:26.563
Okay.

06:26.598 --> 06:29.002
So you believe that Tron's alive?

06:29.036 --> 06:31.773
- I do.
- And you?

06:31.808 --> 06:36.917
- I let my work speak for itself.
- Then so be it.

06:36.951 --> 06:38.587
Wait!

06:38.622 --> 06:39.891
No, no, no! You can't!

06:48.742 --> 06:52.783
- Tron?
- So you're not still gonna derez us?

06:52.817 --> 06:55.822
Duh, he's here
to help us. Right?

06:57.894 --> 07:02.034
Actually, you're going to help me.
But first I have to trust you.

07:07.948 --> 07:12.622
Name's Moog.
And this here's Rasket.

07:12.656 --> 07:14.926
It's pronounced "Ras-kay."

07:14.961 --> 07:19.736
And finally, the heart
and soul of the Jolly Tricksters.

07:19.770 --> 07:20.872
Mara.

07:22.643 --> 07:26.617
Nice to see you again, Tron.

07:33.020 --> 07:35.992
Wait. You two know each other?

07:36.027 --> 07:37.094
- No.
- Yes.

07:37.129 --> 07:40.869
He saved my life.
More than once.

07:40.903 --> 07:43.775
Well, of course he did.
He's impersonating Tron.

07:43.809 --> 07:45.979
I mean, he is Tron.

07:46.013 --> 07:50.989
We're both... all three of us...
huge fans of your work.

07:51.023 --> 07:53.828
Uh, thanks.

07:53.863 --> 07:56.166
I've brought all of
you here for a reason.

07:56.200 --> 07:57.835
There's a revolution coming,

07:57.870 --> 08:00.006
and I need recruits to fight by my side.

08:00.040 --> 08:03.012
So... so what do you say?

08:03.046 --> 08:04.208
Are you up for the challenge?

08:04.216 --> 08:06.988
- Absolutely!
- Of course!

08:07.022 --> 08:10.995
That was easy.
But our task ahead won't be.

08:11.029 --> 08:13.584
I just wanna say that I've been waiting

08:13.585 --> 08:16.138
for an opportunity like
this for a while now,

08:16.172 --> 08:20.881
a chance to show my commitment
to the revolution, to you.

08:20.916 --> 08:24.822
That's very flattering, really.

08:24.857 --> 08:26.894
Look, you've all been through a lot.

08:26.929 --> 08:28.897
Let's call it for now,
then meet back here

08:28.932 --> 08:32.203
at the start of next cycle
for further instructions.

08:34.107 --> 08:35.977
Class dismissed.

08:36.011 --> 08:38.149
Let's go, guys. Let's bounce.

08:39.953 --> 08:44.829
Whatever you want us to do, I want
you to know that I'm not afraid.

08:48.838 --> 08:53.245
<i>Remember when you first approached me?
I said I wasn't afraid.</i>

08:53.280 --> 08:56.251
But how did you really
know I was the right choice?

08:56.286 --> 09:00.026
I didn't. You kept coming back.

09:00.060 --> 09:04.034
The more I pushed,
the harder you fought.

09:04.068 --> 09:06.740
Was I your first choice?

09:06.774 --> 09:08.877
Yes.

09:08.911 --> 09:12.017
Really?
There was no one before me?

09:15.158 --> 09:18.797
Why do you ask?

09:18.831 --> 09:21.135
Is there something you'd
like to tell me, Beck?

09:21.169 --> 09:24.124
No. I was just wondering if you were

09:24.125 --> 09:27.080
afraid you made the wrong choice...

09:27.114 --> 09:28.917
with me.

09:28.951 --> 09:31.188
You're forgetting, when I found you,

09:31.222 --> 09:35.029
you were already waging your
own war against the occupation.

09:35.064 --> 09:37.233
I just steered you down the right path.

09:40.140 --> 09:43.112
<i>The right path... what is it?</i>

09:43.146 --> 09:45.851
<i>Defacing trains and billboards?</i>

09:45.885 --> 09:49.091
<i>Or striking a significant blow
against the enemy's stronghold?</i>

09:49.125 --> 09:51.930
Whoa. That's Tesler's ship.

09:51.964 --> 09:54.034
And you three are going
to help me infiltrate it.

09:54.068 --> 09:56.004
On that ship is a data key.

09:56.039 --> 09:58.977
Tesler's ship is the
biggest canvas in Argon.

09:59.011 --> 10:00.880
We hit that, we'll make history.

10:00.915 --> 10:04.254
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Nobody's
hitting Tesler's ship but me.

10:04.288 --> 10:06.926
In fact, you won't be anywhere near it.

10:06.961 --> 10:08.262
Every fifth cycle,

10:08.296 --> 10:10.233
the ship docks with
the Argon refueling tower.

10:10.267 --> 10:12.003
That's where you three come in.

10:12.037 --> 10:13.239
While I circle by light jet,

10:13.273 --> 10:15.009
you're going to do
what you're good at...

10:15.043 --> 10:17.080
bombard the area with your free code.

10:17.114 --> 10:19.217
In order to draw the guards away,

10:19.252 --> 10:22.056
that way you can sneak
onto the ship undetected.

10:22.091 --> 10:24.294
Do you like
how I put that together?

10:24.328 --> 10:26.230
So we're just your distraction.

10:26.265 --> 10:30.339
Where's the fun in that?
We want in on the thrills.

10:30.374 --> 10:33.145
This isn't about thrills.
I'm trying to gather intel.

10:33.180 --> 10:36.886
And if you can't understand that,
then maybe I've made a mistake.

10:36.921 --> 10:40.226
Tron, wait.
I can't believe what I'm hearing.

10:40.260 --> 10:42.897
Do you know who we're talking to?

10:42.932 --> 10:46.204
This is the program who
inspired you to create,

10:46.238 --> 10:50.046
and inspired you to help
Rasket realize his mission.

10:50.080 --> 10:51.247
Uh, "Ras-kay."

10:51.281 --> 10:52.984
Whatever.

10:53.018 --> 10:56.157
He's risking his life out
there and he needs our help.

10:56.191 --> 10:59.999
I don't know about you guys,
but I'm giving it to him.

11:03.173 --> 11:06.912
Us, too. When do we start?

11:24.080 --> 11:27.052
Right on time. Be careful.

11:37.373 --> 11:39.209
<i>Security zone compromised.</i>

11:39.244 --> 11:41.281
Alert commander Paige.

12:00.019 --> 12:04.226
<i>Stand clear of docking.
Prepare for refuel.</i>

12:10.941 --> 12:15.248
<i>Perpetrators at large.
Report or be derezzed.</i>

12:17.120 --> 12:19.089
Hey, where are you two going?

12:19.124 --> 12:21.962
<i>The plan is to meet
Tron at the warehouse.</i>

12:21.996 --> 12:24.233
Change of plans, baby.

12:46.143 --> 12:50.952
<i>All personnel remain in docking area
until refueling is complete.</i>

13:17.206 --> 13:19.008
You're alone.

13:19.042 --> 13:22.047
- Why?
- I tried to stop them.

13:22.082 --> 13:24.988
Stop them? Mara, where are they?

13:28.428 --> 13:29.998
<i>There.</i>

13:30.032 --> 13:31.267
What were they thinking?

13:31.301 --> 13:34.339
They weren't.
I usually handle that part.

13:34.374 --> 13:38.014
This is as far as you go.
I'll take care of the rest.

13:38.048 --> 13:40.318
Uh, try again.

13:40.352 --> 13:42.221
I'm the one who talked
them into joining you.

13:42.255 --> 13:44.058
Besides, I know their plan.

13:44.092 --> 13:46.397
Without me, you'll
never find them in time.

13:46.431 --> 13:49.202
And I won't take no
for an answer.

13:49.237 --> 13:52.374
I was afraid of that.

13:56.484 --> 14:00.057
Zed is never going to believe this!

14:03.131 --> 14:05.067
No sign of the Renegade.

14:05.101 --> 14:07.271
Or whoever struck by
the refueling tower.

14:07.305 --> 14:09.376
Unacceptable. Keep looking.

14:09.410 --> 14:12.114
This "Tron lives" blasphemy must stop.

14:12.148 --> 14:16.023
Then you definitely
shouldn't look outside, sir.

14:17.108 --> 14:20.263
Where is that coming from?

14:20.298 --> 14:25.440
Far as I can tell, from us.

14:28.314 --> 14:30.283
Perhaps we better abscond.

14:30.318 --> 14:33.456
Aw, I was just getting
in the zone.

14:35.528 --> 14:37.499
<i>Security alert.</i>

14:39.070 --> 14:40.270
<i>Security alert.</i>

14:42.075 --> 14:43.443
<i>Security alert.</i>

14:44.480 --> 14:46.315
<i>Security alert.</i>

14:53.330 --> 14:55.467
What are you two grinning for?

15:05.556 --> 15:08.326
I'm disappointed that
you're not the Renegade,

15:08.360 --> 15:11.299
but that doesn't mean we
still can't have fun together.

15:20.384 --> 15:23.256
Moog, what are we walking on?

15:23.290 --> 15:27.298
I think you mean...
"who" are we walking on.

15:31.473 --> 15:33.409
- Did he scream?
- Yes, sir.

15:39.155 --> 15:43.229
That's the problem with these
programs, they can't hold it together.

15:54.085 --> 15:56.422
A little privacy, please.

16:02.335 --> 16:04.305
<i>Security breach contained.</i>

16:04.339 --> 16:09.415
<i>General Tesler, please report to
prison level for interrogation.</i>

16:09.449 --> 16:12.254
<i>While you're able to
talk, why not tell me</i>

16:12.255 --> 16:15.059
<i>the location of your
leader, the Renegade!</i>

16:15.093 --> 16:18.165
Look, we don't know!
You have to believe us, okay?!

16:18.200 --> 16:20.270
Where's the fun in that?

16:27.385 --> 16:31.459
Please! We're sorry!
We're just artists!

16:31.493 --> 16:35.333
Oh, so you work with your hands.

16:52.502 --> 16:53.536
Get him!

16:58.547 --> 17:02.354
They're sealing us in.
We'll be trapped.

17:05.461 --> 17:10.069
I'll handle the Renegade.
You get the others.

17:10.104 --> 17:14.310
You three get that gate open...
while I deal with them.

17:24.164 --> 17:28.373
- You don't give up, do you?
- No, and I never will.

17:32.281 --> 17:34.417
You're gonna wanna hurry, Mara.

17:34.451 --> 17:36.421
I can't!
There's not enough time!

17:36.455 --> 17:39.594
Then what are we waiting for?!
Catch!

17:39.628 --> 17:41.464
No, wait! What about Tron?

17:41.499 --> 17:46.241
What about him?
He's fine. He's Tron.

17:59.635 --> 18:02.506
We need to go now!

18:06.515 --> 18:10.189
I was wrong! It's not more
fun when they chase us!

18:10.223 --> 18:12.426
I thought you were
all about the thrills.

19:17.557 --> 19:19.527
<i>Mara, go!</i>

19:53.729 --> 19:57.503
- We messed up.
- Yeah, we messed up bad.

19:57.537 --> 19:59.439
And thanks
for coming back for us.

19:59.473 --> 20:02.445
- It's not just me you have to thank.
- You're welcome.

20:02.479 --> 20:06.387
That right path you mentioned...
it's out there, isn't it?

20:06.422 --> 20:09.392
It's Argon.
That's what you've been fighting for.

20:09.427 --> 20:10.729
It's more than Argon.

20:10.763 --> 20:13.301
You're taking the fight
all the way to Clu.

20:13.336 --> 20:15.739
You're fighting so this stops.

20:15.773 --> 20:20.348
Then join me. Let me put
your talents to good use.

20:20.383 --> 20:23.621
The uprising needs you.
And so do I.

20:23.656 --> 20:25.625
We're not good enough. No way.

20:25.660 --> 20:27.528
We barely survived up there.

20:27.563 --> 20:30.401
I don't think we'll be
as lucky a second time.

20:32.339 --> 20:36.381
Your cause is right,
but we're not your army.

20:36.415 --> 20:42.558
Hey, it's a good thing Tron lives.
Argon needs you.

20:46.668 --> 20:51.511
I'm still in. No matter the
risks, I'm ready for this.

20:54.384 --> 20:56.687
I'm not.

20:56.722 --> 20:58.691
What does that mean?

20:58.726 --> 21:01.764
It means without your friends
you're of no help to me.

21:01.799 --> 21:04.503
<i>Go home.</i>

21:08.678 --> 21:12.485
It was the only way
to get her to leave.

21:12.519 --> 21:16.527
She was the one true
believer in the cause.

21:16.562 --> 21:19.800
But I wasn't prepared
for the consequences.

21:19.835 --> 21:22.773
Then you made the right decision.

21:22.807 --> 21:27.381
<i>If she's really willing to
risk everything for the cause,</i>

21:27.416 --> 21:31.523
<i>she'll still be there...
when you're ready.</i>
