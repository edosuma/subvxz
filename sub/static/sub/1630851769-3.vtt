00:13.388 --> 00:16.850
- It is with your negligence
that Carrie Ecker escaped.

00:16.891 --> 00:18.393
Find and return her at once.

00:18.435 --> 00:20.020
- Are the scars from them?

00:20.061 --> 00:21.688
Just curious why y'all live
out in the woods like that.

00:21.730 --> 00:23.857
- Deep in the woods
stands a lone Door.

00:23.898 --> 00:26.860
My colony exists entirely
to protect the world

00:26.901 --> 00:28.903
from the awful things
beyond that Door.

00:28.945 --> 00:30.405
And one of them got out.

00:30.447 --> 00:32.782
- You should've
had your eye on her!

00:32.824 --> 00:34.701
- One of you must act
as its prey.

00:34.743 --> 00:39.205
I will follow from behind
and take care of the rest.

00:39.247 --> 00:41.249
- It's real.

00:43.626 --> 00:46.921
- There's no greater act
of love

00:46.963 --> 00:49.132
than the act of self-sacrifice.

00:50.759 --> 00:56.222
In the years to come,
when your skin is maimed

00:56.264 --> 00:58.725
and your bones broken,

00:58.767 --> 01:02.062
you can look your friends
in the eye and say,

01:02.103 --> 01:04.147
"I have loved."

01:08.735 --> 01:12.489
The Guardianship is only
for the purest of heart.

01:13.740 --> 01:16.743
Six years of battling off
the ravenous Bloodherd

01:16.785 --> 01:18.745
in the depths of Gehenna,

01:18.787 --> 01:22.123
of learning the divine secrets
that lay in the Ledger.

01:22.165 --> 01:24.209
Six years of sacrifice.

01:25.335 --> 01:26.920
You think you have
enough love to give?

01:26.961 --> 01:28.254
all:
Yes!

01:28.296 --> 01:30.340
- Then say it loud and clear.

01:30.382 --> 01:33.301
all: I am a vessel
filled with light.

01:33.343 --> 01:36.429
I am a weapon
against the shadow.

01:36.471 --> 01:39.724
My pain is a symptom
of sacrifice.

01:39.766 --> 01:42.936
My sacrifice is
a symptom of love.

01:42.977 --> 01:44.270
- Louder!

01:44.312 --> 01:47.232
all: I am a vessel
filled with light.

01:47.273 --> 01:50.443
I am a weapon
against the shadow.

01:50.485 --> 01:53.613
My pain is a symptom
of sacrifice.

01:53.655 --> 01:56.408
My sacrifice
is a symptom of love.

01:58.827 --> 02:01.788
I am a vessel
filled with light.

02:01.830 --> 02:04.749
I am a weapon
against the shadow.

02:04.791 --> 02:07.794
My pain is a symptom
of sacrifice.

02:07.836 --> 02:10.797
My sacrifice
is a symptom of love.

02:12.674 --> 02:15.468
I am a vessel
filled with light.

02:15.510 --> 02:18.388
I am a weapon
against the shadow.

02:18.430 --> 02:21.474
My pain is a symptom
of sacrifice.

02:21.516 --> 02:25.812
My sacrifice is
a symptom of love.

02:25.854 --> 02:27.147
- Emotion.

02:27.188 --> 02:28.857
Better not strike
than act too soon.

02:28.898 --> 02:30.066
Fodder for the Herd.

02:30.108 --> 02:32.736
all: I am a weapon
against the shadow.

02:32.777 --> 02:35.780
My pain is a symptom
of sacrifice.

02:35.822 --> 02:38.533
My sacrifice is
a symptom of love.

02:42.495 --> 02:44.497
- I could do better.

02:44.539 --> 02:46.583
- It's early in training.

02:47.625 --> 02:50.003
- Council leader's
disappointed.

02:50.045 --> 02:51.880
He sees my mother in me.

02:53.548 --> 02:56.343
- You're not your mom.

02:56.384 --> 02:57.802
You're brave.

02:59.596 --> 03:02.932
We're in this together, okay?

03:23.870 --> 03:25.955
all: I am a vessel
filled with light--

03:25.997 --> 03:28.208
- Horrors of Gehenna
lie in the mental

03:28.249 --> 03:29.459
as much as the physical.

03:29.501 --> 03:31.419
As weeks become months,

03:31.461 --> 03:34.255
they'll prey on the dark
recesses of your mind.

03:40.553 --> 03:42.389
Your longest time yet.

03:53.817 --> 03:55.318
Let's go.

04:33.565 --> 04:36.693
- Calm. Steady.

04:38.445 --> 04:41.948
Calm. Steady.

04:50.749 --> 04:56.296
- Carrie, calm mind. Steady.

04:56.338 --> 04:59.507
Calm mind. Steady.

04:59.549 --> 05:02.469
all: My pain
is a symptom of sacrifice.

05:02.510 --> 05:05.513
My sacrifice is
a symptom of love.

05:42.634 --> 05:46.680
- Okay, Mom. Okay.

05:46.721 --> 05:48.515
Everything's gonna be fine.

05:52.227 --> 05:53.687
Boom.

05:53.728 --> 05:56.064
Snug as a bug on drugs.
- Thank you.

05:56.106 --> 05:59.442
- Mrs. Frisk, do you remember
anything from the past hour?

05:59.484 --> 06:02.612
A whistling sound?
Almost angelic?

06:04.155 --> 06:07.158
A tall figure with a mask?

06:07.200 --> 06:08.201
A gold coin, maybe?

06:08.243 --> 06:12.539
- I-I remember ecstasy.

06:12.580 --> 06:14.207
Ecstasy.

06:19.587 --> 06:22.632
- Is it okay
if I hold your hand?

06:22.674 --> 06:25.093
To warm you up?

06:37.105 --> 06:38.690
- I'll be the lure.

06:42.152 --> 06:43.737
Let's kill this thing.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.913
- Pretty big of you
to put yourself in harm's way.

06:53.955 --> 06:56.666
- Yeah, well if this
were "Jaws,"

06:56.708 --> 06:58.460
I'd be like the stink bait

06:58.501 --> 07:01.421
that they use
to lure the shark in.

07:01.463 --> 07:04.174
- You're my stink bait.

07:04.215 --> 07:06.593
- You're supposed to say
that I'm the shark.

07:08.136 --> 07:11.639
- I'm just having a bit of
a hard time visualizing it, so.

07:11.681 --> 07:13.433
- Oh, my God!

07:13.475 --> 07:15.810
Nolan! Angel. Darling.

07:15.852 --> 07:18.730
You're like my big dog
alpha dog.

07:18.772 --> 07:22.359
- Yeah, such a big dog
alpha dog that I'm literally

07:22.400 --> 07:25.945
about to piss my pants
from nerves, so watch out.

07:25.987 --> 07:27.989
'Cause, yeah.

07:30.950 --> 07:32.494
- Okay, bye.

07:34.204 --> 07:35.538
- What?

07:41.378 --> 07:44.631
- Gonna pee my pants. Hot.

08:04.484 --> 08:08.029
Yes, you.

08:08.071 --> 08:11.282
- Brings the total missing
in West Pine to five,

08:11.324 --> 08:13.535
all within 36 hours.

08:13.576 --> 08:16.913
The mayor is now implementing
a town-wide curfew--

08:27.465 --> 08:28.883
- Hello?

09:05.295 --> 09:07.672
Jeez.

09:07.714 --> 09:09.132
- You're scared of me.

09:09.174 --> 09:10.550
- No.

09:10.592 --> 09:11.801
- Yes, you are.
You're scared of me.

09:11.843 --> 09:14.012
- No, Carrie, I'm not.

09:16.848 --> 09:21.102
Christ is lord. Fuck me.

09:21.144 --> 09:22.729
- It's fine.

09:22.771 --> 09:24.230
I'd be scared of me too.

09:24.272 --> 09:26.191
- There's just--there's a lot
going on right now.

09:26.232 --> 09:27.233
- I'm a weapon.

09:27.275 --> 09:28.568
That's how the Colony
trained me.

09:28.610 --> 09:29.903
Don't think, just--
- All right.

09:29.944 --> 09:32.238
You're not--
you're not some weapon.

09:32.280 --> 09:33.782
You could be in Salem
right now,

09:33.823 --> 09:35.909
but you're in shitty old
West Pine doing what's right.

09:35.950 --> 09:40.413
I just leave when
there's drama, so props.

09:40.455 --> 09:42.832
- That's not true.

09:42.874 --> 09:44.417
You helped me.

09:49.130 --> 09:53.760
- People look at me and think
mad jokes,

09:53.802 --> 09:56.846
mad style, chill,

09:56.888 --> 09:59.474
but the entire time in my head,
I'm like,

09:59.516 --> 10:02.060
"Don't stop moving.
Don't think about Mom's death.

10:02.102 --> 10:05.105
Don't think about Dad's debt.
Distract, distract, distract."

10:05.146 --> 10:08.233
It's like a factory
for exhausting thoughts.

10:08.274 --> 10:10.151
You know,
in the last weeks of her life,

10:10.193 --> 10:14.531
I spent almost all my free time
at Evolve Dance Studio

10:14.572 --> 10:17.701
like-like-like a dumb slut.

10:22.914 --> 10:25.000
I just want to start over too.

10:27.210 --> 10:28.795
Be like a baby.

10:31.506 --> 10:33.008
- Be anyone.

10:35.010 --> 10:37.178
- Get out of West Pine
at least.

10:44.561 --> 10:46.980
- Ready to hunt a monster?

11:32.317 --> 11:34.778
- Better not to strike
than strike early.

11:34.819 --> 11:37.364
Calm mind. Steady hand.

12:04.349 --> 12:08.478
You're holding back, Carrie.
Mercy has no place in Gehenna.

12:22.617 --> 12:24.285
- Council leader?

13:00.030 --> 13:01.906
- You're not allowed in here.

13:03.324 --> 13:04.367
- Father.

13:08.705 --> 13:11.791
I don't understand why
I can't visit my family home.

13:11.833 --> 13:15.045
- My new post forbids
preferential treatment.

13:15.086 --> 13:16.254
- So I'm not entitled

13:16.296 --> 13:18.465
to ask my own blood
for training advice?

13:18.506 --> 13:20.925
- I have to treat
all the children equally.

13:23.762 --> 13:25.638
- Then as council leader?

13:30.018 --> 13:32.771
- When I look at you,

13:32.812 --> 13:35.106
I see her,

13:35.148 --> 13:36.941
your mother.

13:38.568 --> 13:40.987
A sniveling little victim
who flees hardship

13:41.029 --> 13:42.947
at a moment's notice.

13:49.829 --> 13:51.581
- Sara's just stronger than me.

14:03.468 --> 14:06.262
- Pressure points.
Remember these?

14:08.473 --> 14:12.477
It's how you exploit
vulnerability that counts.

14:12.519 --> 14:16.815
The Bloodherd overpowers
all of us,

14:16.856 --> 14:18.650
so be ruthless.

14:20.193 --> 14:23.279
Pain is a symptom of sacrifice.

14:28.702 --> 14:32.247
- And sacrifice
is a symptom of love.

14:32.288 --> 14:34.416
- Win the Guardianship.

14:34.457 --> 14:36.209
Then I'll call you my daughter.

15:04.112 --> 15:06.281
- Tasha, why are you
walking like that?

15:06.322 --> 15:07.490
- It's my power pose.

15:07.532 --> 15:09.409
I do it before recitals
when I'm nervous.

15:09.451 --> 15:11.703
- Oh, hell's greatest weakness:
empowered dancers.

15:11.745 --> 15:13.121
I feel so safe.

15:13.163 --> 15:16.458
- Anything to stay calm.
What are you doing?

15:16.499 --> 15:18.126
- Oh, oh this is called
the mean lean.

15:18.168 --> 15:20.628
It's like the power pose
but way sicker.

15:20.670 --> 15:22.297
- Well, our friendship
is actually canceled now.

15:22.339 --> 15:24.049
- Demons hate this shit.
Freaks them out.

15:24.090 --> 15:26.134
- You freak 'em out you 'cause
you're a freaky little boy.

15:26.176 --> 15:27.344
- Little boy?

15:27.385 --> 15:28.970
both:
Little child.

15:32.724 --> 15:36.227
- It's good you're laughing.
A calm mind is a steady hand.

15:36.269 --> 15:38.355
Remember,
if you get too scared,

15:38.396 --> 15:39.939
if you flinch
in the place of action,

15:39.981 --> 15:42.192
the Bloodherd will sniff
your weakness and kill you.

15:42.233 --> 15:43.943
But if the Ledger is right,

15:43.985 --> 15:46.363
then the Hypnotist prefers
to lure from a safe distance

15:46.404 --> 15:49.157
rather than attack with force,
so you should be safe.

15:50.909 --> 15:53.119
Nolan, are you ready?

15:53.161 --> 15:54.913
- Yes, sir. Ma'am.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.247
- You cannot drop the act.

15:56.289 --> 15:57.874
The Herd don't have eyes,
but it will know.

15:57.916 --> 16:00.251
Once it's onto you,
you must remain steady.

16:00.293 --> 16:03.421
Under no circumstances
should you try to fight it.

16:05.090 --> 16:06.716
This is not gold.

16:06.758 --> 16:09.427
It's devil's bone,
and it comes from their world.

16:09.469 --> 16:12.055
It's the only way to kill them.

16:12.097 --> 16:14.683
Do not try to attack.

16:14.724 --> 16:16.976
Devil's bone.

16:17.018 --> 16:18.395
- Nolan, what did you take?

16:18.436 --> 16:19.729
- Calm mind, steady hand.

16:19.771 --> 16:22.107
- This is real, dude.
It's not cute.

16:25.610 --> 16:28.613
Headphones ready?
Let me see your phone.

16:30.782 --> 16:32.575
Make sure the volume
stays all the way up.

16:32.617 --> 16:35.578
- And look at your feet,
never into its coin.

16:35.620 --> 16:39.582
Imagine what your mom is
going through but much worse.

16:39.624 --> 16:41.876
It marks the trees
to claim the woods.

16:41.918 --> 16:44.379
That's how it draws its power
from Gehenna.

16:44.421 --> 16:48.216
Call, and it will come.

16:48.258 --> 16:50.093
- I'm gonna be fine.
- You're gonna be fine.

16:50.135 --> 16:51.553
- Whoa.
both: Really? Really brave.

16:51.594 --> 16:54.514
- Brave as--mind meld.
- Weird.

16:54.556 --> 16:56.307
- Wait, wait, wait, wait,
um, Tasha,

16:56.349 --> 17:00.437
just in case
anything legit bad happens,

17:00.478 --> 17:04.274
I-I want you to know
that you're so beautiful.

17:04.315 --> 17:06.860
No, stop. Like a sexy machine.

17:06.901 --> 17:08.486
You're like a sexy church.

17:08.528 --> 17:11.114
- Why am I like a sexy church?

17:15.827 --> 17:17.454
Good luck, Stink Bait.

17:53.782 --> 17:54.741
- Ow!

18:04.417 --> 18:08.338
To vast Gehenna,
I give my skin.

18:08.380 --> 18:11.508
Pray warm shadow let me in.

18:22.060 --> 18:24.229
This is so fucking metal.

19:03.601 --> 19:08.064
- What are you doing? Fight me.

19:08.106 --> 19:10.984
Come on, we've been training
for this our whole lives.

19:11.026 --> 19:12.569
Fight me.

19:17.615 --> 19:19.284
Call it. I'm done.

19:19.325 --> 19:22.412
- The final fight lasts
till one of you touches dirt.

19:22.454 --> 19:23.580
- Well, I'm not gonna hurt her

19:23.621 --> 19:26.708
while she just
stands there, so.

19:29.586 --> 19:32.047
It's weird he's just a dot
on the screen.

19:32.088 --> 19:33.965
I realize he's probably
losing his shit,

19:34.007 --> 19:35.258
but here,
he's just dotting around.

19:35.300 --> 19:36.426
- Just-just give me that.

19:36.468 --> 19:37.802
Nolan and I can
take it from here.

19:37.844 --> 19:38.970
- You'd literally have
to literally stab me

19:39.012 --> 19:40.722
multiple times
in the eye with your blade

19:40.764 --> 19:42.724
to get me not to help.

19:42.766 --> 19:44.851
- I thought you were supposed
to be a coward.

19:44.893 --> 19:47.479
- I thought you were supposed
to be a bad person.

19:50.273 --> 19:52.817
Shit. This service.

19:54.110 --> 19:56.654
- Come on. We're close.
Just press on.

20:09.834 --> 20:12.295
- Come on.
Follow the scary monster.

20:12.337 --> 20:14.005
Follow the scary monster.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.884
Oh, why the fuck
did I agree to this?

20:32.440 --> 20:33.858
- Stay back.

21:18.862 --> 21:20.155
- Go, go, go, go, go, go.

21:20.196 --> 21:22.157
We're coming back, Lumi.
I promise.

21:26.494 --> 21:27.495
- Hey.

21:44.137 --> 21:45.930
- That's the old mine entrance.

22:00.737 --> 22:03.740
- So what do we do now?

22:03.782 --> 22:05.825
- I'm gonna end this thing.

23:21.860 --> 23:24.988
- Oh, demon,
what have you done?

23:43.757 --> 23:46.634
Calm mind. Steady hand.

23:46.676 --> 23:48.053
- Carrie?

23:50.138 --> 23:52.932
They want you back.

23:52.974 --> 23:54.642
They sent me.

24:10.367 --> 24:13.453
I thought I'd be angry, but...

24:14.829 --> 24:16.664
It's really you.

24:16.706 --> 24:18.750
I get why you did it.

24:18.792 --> 24:21.503
I hurt you,

24:21.544 --> 24:23.046
and I'm sorry.

24:42.023 --> 24:43.191
- No.

24:44.984 --> 24:46.236
I am.

25:23.940 --> 25:26.317
- Hey. Hey.

25:26.359 --> 25:27.485
Hey. Hey.

25:27.527 --> 25:30.196
You're not a weapon.
You're not a weapon.

25:33.283 --> 25:35.827
You're not a weapon.

25:35.869 --> 25:37.620
It's dead, okay?

25:38.580 --> 25:42.250
It's dead. You're not a weapon.
You're not a weapon.

25:42.292 --> 25:44.419
- What was it doing down here?

25:44.461 --> 25:47.088
- Hey, who's there?
This is WPN property.

25:47.130 --> 25:48.798
- We have to dip. Like, now.

25:48.840 --> 25:50.592
- Remember how I said
that the wrong person

25:50.633 --> 25:52.260
could open up a new door?

25:52.302 --> 25:54.304
Let all the nightmares out?

25:56.556 --> 25:59.267
Well, I think it might
have done just that.

26:07.359 --> 26:09.736
- I said, who's there?

26:09.778 --> 26:11.321
- Go, go, go, go, go!
