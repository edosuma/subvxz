00:01.050 --> 00:04.050
My father worked as a lawyer for
the richest family in New York

00:04.059 --> 00:07.050
until his plane went
down in long island sound.

00:07.060 --> 00:09.130
He left me his biggest client,

00:09.140 --> 00:11.730
the Darlings--Tripp, the
empire builder...

00:11.740 --> 00:14.470
So you knew about the affair
between Letitia and my father?

00:14.480 --> 00:15.400
Of course.

00:15.410 --> 00:19.640
Letitia, the sophisticated
socialite, Patrick, the principled politician...

00:19.650 --> 00:21.360
I don't want to run for senate.

00:21.370 --> 00:23.370
I think that you should run.

00:23.380 --> 00:24.670
What do you want to do?

00:24.680 --> 00:26.310
Divorcee...

00:28.890 --> 00:30.150
Brian, the man of God...

00:30.160 --> 00:31.990
I lied to my wife and
daughters last night.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.490
I told them that you were an orphan.

00:33.500 --> 00:34.560
Does he speak English?

00:34.570 --> 00:36.100
No, uh, just Swedish.

00:36.110 --> 00:38.580
And Jeremy and Juliet, the
well-behaved twins.

00:38.590 --> 00:41.440
Don't lie to me, Jeremy, especially
about Natalie kimpton.

00:41.450 --> 00:42.570
I want you.

00:42.590 --> 00:43.570
If Juliet found out...

00:43.580 --> 00:44.970
She won't find out.

00:44.980 --> 00:47.690
My father was gathering information
on billionaire Simon elder.

00:47.700 --> 00:50.900
If I were trying to figure
out who had killed my father,

00:50.920 --> 00:53.320
that's the guy I'd start with.

01:01.700 --> 01:02.860
You have to eat good food.

01:02.870 --> 01:04.200
I'm putting the carrots in your lunch.

01:04.209 --> 01:05.900
Oh, dad. Yuck!

01:05.910 --> 01:07.600
I mean, they taste like toenails.

01:07.610 --> 01:09.530
How do you know what toenails
taste like? That not right.

01:09.540 --> 01:11.380
Why is Patrick Darling on TV?

01:11.390 --> 01:13.610
Because he is running for
the United States senate.

01:13.620 --> 01:17.270
So you're willing to go on record
that you have never committed adultery?

01:17.280 --> 01:19.490
Ever since I got married, I've
done nothing, Lara,

01:19.500 --> 01:21.210
but be faithful to my wife

01:21.220 --> 01:25.280
and try to set a fine moral example for
my children and all the people of New York.

01:25.290 --> 01:27.120
So Patrick's really running?

01:27.700 --> 01:29.010
Tripp got what he wanted.

01:29.020 --> 01:30.640
He usually does.

01:30.650 --> 01:33.710
You know, I think he'll
make a great senator.

01:33.720 --> 01:36.320
Okay, I think that's enough TV.

01:36.810 --> 01:39.930
Why don't you go get your book report
and finish getting ready for school?

01:39.940 --> 01:41.380
Okay.

01:44.170 --> 01:47.720
Are you sure going to the police about
Simon elder is a safe thing to do?

01:47.730 --> 01:49.600
Don't you think you might
need a little more evidence

01:49.610 --> 01:53.470
before accusing the richest man
in the world of being a murderer?

01:53.480 --> 01:55.950
Look, Lisa, the evidence I
have is the evidence I have.

01:55.960 --> 01:57.910
What do you want me to
do, just wait and see?

01:57.920 --> 01:59.430
I can't.

02:00.320 --> 02:02.240
You can ask Tripp for help.

02:02.250 --> 02:03.840
You agreed to represent the family.

02:03.850 --> 02:05.110
It's the least he can do.

02:05.120 --> 02:07.150
Yes, but can I trust him?

02:07.590 --> 02:08.580
Maybe.

02:08.590 --> 02:13.510
So being Tripp Darling's trusted advisor doesn't
have a whole lot to do with trust, does it?

02:14.220 --> 02:17.130
Until I find out who killed my dad, no.

02:26.570 --> 02:27.260
Morning, Clark.

02:27.270 --> 02:28.740
Good morning, Mr. George.

02:28.750 --> 02:30.480
So what, Tripp thinks
if he sends the rolls,

02:30.490 --> 02:32.300
I'll take the ride to work?

02:32.760 --> 02:34.540
Hop in, Nicky.

02:36.460 --> 02:38.060
What, did you just wake up?

02:38.070 --> 02:39.040
Oh, God, no.

02:39.050 --> 02:40.990
I haven't slept a wink.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.170
What's the matter?

02:42.180 --> 02:46.850
I'm tormented by the thought that Simon elder
could've had something to do with that plane ing down.

02:46.860 --> 02:48.170
We have to do something.

02:48.180 --> 02:49.980
Well, I'm seeing the police later today.

02:49.990 --> 02:51.540
The police?

02:52.030 --> 02:55.350
I don't think the police will
be much help with Simon elder.

02:55.360 --> 02:58.160
A man in that kind of
position, the police can't really--

02:58.170 --> 03:02.610
I mean, I think he's-- he's
probably pretty much untouchable.

03:03.290 --> 03:04.870
I could have someone look into it.

03:04.880 --> 03:05.770
No, that's all right. Thanks.

03:05.780 --> 03:08.720
Your dad had a private investigator
that we used a couple of times--

03:08.730 --> 03:09.980
Tripp, here's what I
think we should do--

03:09.990 --> 03:11.700
I think we should let the
police handle the matter,

03:11.710 --> 03:14.560
let them decide whether or not
there's reason for suspicion.

03:14.570 --> 03:16.190
That's what I think we should do.

03:16.200 --> 03:18.410
Clark, right here, please.

03:24.300 --> 03:27.540
You still think someone in our
family could've been responsible?

03:27.550 --> 03:28.270
I didn't say that.

03:28.280 --> 03:34.280
Personally, I think the dossier your dad
complied on Simon elder was pretty damning.

03:34.290 --> 03:36.820
Well, and I'm bringing it
into the police later today.

03:36.830 --> 03:39.210
Yeah-- I just have to
be able to do it my way.

03:40.860 --> 03:42.680
Please.

03:43.470 --> 03:44.770
Okay.

03:50.130 --> 03:51.410
Look, I'm just gonna run home from here.

03:51.420 --> 03:53.810
I'll see you later this morning. Okay?

03:53.820 --> 03:55.930
You take care of yourself. Okay?

03:59.480 --> 04:03.460
Daisy, I need you to go on the Internet and find
out all the information you can on Simon elder.

04:03.470 --> 04:05.720
I want interviews, profiles, corporate
reports--

04:05.730 --> 04:06.680
anything you can find.

04:06.690 --> 04:07.330
No problem.

04:07.340 --> 04:10.360
And I also need you to make one copy
of every piecef paper in this dossier.

04:10.370 --> 04:11.640
I have to bring it to the police later.

04:11.650 --> 04:12.590
No problem.

04:12.600 --> 04:15.700
And I don't want to be bothered by
anyone for at least the next hour.

04:16.290 --> 04:17.579
Problem!

04:18.589 --> 04:21.050
Rebecca colfax, Darling family publicist.

04:21.060 --> 04:23.240
Well, I'm charmed all over again.

04:23.250 --> 04:25.060
Rebecca colfax is here for you.

04:25.070 --> 04:27.170
Yeah, I see. Thanks, Daisy.

04:27.490 --> 04:28.450
What's up?

04:28.460 --> 04:29.310
This.

04:29.320 --> 04:31.800
The call came into my
office at 2:00 a.m.For Tripp.

04:31.810 --> 04:33.500
Why is Tripp getting
calls at your office?

04:33.510 --> 04:35.200
Guess they didn't have his home number.

04:35.210 --> 04:37.140
What a surprise. Listen up.

04:37.150 --> 04:39.240
Hey, Mr. Darling, just
thought you might want to know

04:39.250 --> 04:42.140
there's a pretty raunchy sex tape
gonna hit the web at midnight Thursday

04:42.150 --> 04:44.150
if you don't pay me
one million American.

04:44.160 --> 04:47.070
Mm-hmm, you tall poppy, that's
right, one bloody mil.

04:47.250 --> 04:49.040
Turn it down, Rache!

04:49.050 --> 04:52.290
Wouldn't be too good for your little
Patty's senate campaign, now would it?

04:52.300 --> 04:53.370
Wait to hear from me.

04:53.380 --> 04:55.970
Oh, I got you by the natties now, mate.

04:56.880 --> 04:58.790
Uh, so wait, have you told
Tripp about this yet?

04:58.800 --> 05:00.220
- Not yet.
- Good.Don't.

05:00.230 --> 05:01.300
Did you contact the police?

05:01.310 --> 05:02.590
I'm contacting you.

05:02.600 --> 05:04.510
Until this thing becomes
a matter of public record,

05:04.520 --> 05:07.290
which it won't if you do
your job, it's a legal problem.

05:07.300 --> 05:09.160
It's not an after-school spin project.

05:09.170 --> 05:11.710
Besides, Patrick's campaign
launches tomorrow night,

05:11.720 --> 05:15.400
and between the good press and the bad
prs, I'm kinda up to my knees in freaks.

05:15.410 --> 05:16.160
Yeah.

05:16.170 --> 05:17.920
Well, let's just think for a second.

05:17.930 --> 05:21.280
Do we even know that
this tape actually exists?

05:21.290 --> 05:22.640
Think about it.

05:22.650 --> 05:24.790
Patrick Darling.

05:25.620 --> 05:27.370
I'll talk to him.

05:28.350 --> 05:29.540
Patrick.

05:33.050 --> 05:36.870
I saw your little performance
on "Lara cumberland.

05:37.570 --> 05:39.500
Come on, son.

05:39.510 --> 05:43.530
You can't spend your whole
campaign fielding questions about...

05:44.090 --> 05:44.990
What do you call it?

05:45.000 --> 05:47.230
I mean, it's gonna come
out, this sex thing.

05:47.240 --> 05:49.160
I-I tried to talk policy, dad.

05:49.170 --> 05:50.800
She--she
pushed.

05:50.810 --> 05:52.880
Yeah, somebody's gonna shove.

05:52.890 --> 05:55.480
What do you think I should do?

05:55.490 --> 05:56.960
I'm sure you have a detailed plan.

05:56.970 --> 05:58.680
Patrick...

05:59.270 --> 06:04.060
You can do great things if we can
win this election, great things.

06:04.590 --> 06:07.100
You have to get your house in order.

06:07.270 --> 06:09.950
You have to let this person go.

06:11.690 --> 06:13.230
Right.

06:15.840 --> 06:17.420
Thanks.

06:19.340 --> 06:23.770
Juliet Darling, is it true you got banned
from the argyle for starting a fire?

06:23.780 --> 06:25.450
That was an accident.

06:25.460 --> 06:27.070
Isn't this really about Natalie kimpton?

06:27.080 --> 06:29.510
You hate each other so much, you
can't even stay in the same hotel?

06:29.520 --> 06:30.650
Is that what she said?

06:30.660 --> 06:31.240
Oh, no.

06:31.250 --> 06:34.400
She said you're "a small-minded
fashion victim," end quote.

06:34.950 --> 06:36.560
Do you have a comment to that?

06:37.550 --> 06:41.360
I have never wanted anything
but good things for Natalie.

06:41.370 --> 06:44.280
I wish her success and happiness.

06:44.290 --> 06:46.940
Peace out. Bring the boys home.

06:48.740 --> 06:51.160
Hey... Jeremy.

06:53.520 --> 06:55.700
You know what would be so random?

06:57.960 --> 07:00.290
Me going to Patrick's bash.

07:03.300 --> 07:04.450
No.

07:04.460 --> 07:08.470
You and Jules at the same
party can never happen, ever.

07:08.480 --> 07:11.660
If she even suspects
we're seeing each other...

07:11.670 --> 07:13.030
But, Jeremy...

07:13.440 --> 07:17.070
There's a diamond necklace
there that I would kill for.

07:17.710 --> 07:20.300
And people get to take
whatever they want, right?

07:20.310 --> 07:21.550
I'll buy you the necklace.

07:21.560 --> 07:22.530
No!

07:22.540 --> 07:24.630
I don't want you to buy
it. I want it for free.

07:24.640 --> 07:26.150
Paying for stuff sucks.

07:26.160 --> 07:27.640
Natalie...

07:27.650 --> 07:28.780
No.

07:29.740 --> 07:32.420
You got my sister
thrown out of the hotel.

07:32.430 --> 07:33.610
I did not.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.970
I saw you talking to the manager.

07:36.230 --> 07:38.410
It was about my smoothies.

07:38.420 --> 07:41.620
They were putting in
way too much banana.

07:42.560 --> 07:45.890
You don't seem to mind when
I put in too much banana.

07:49.370 --> 07:52.500
So I hate to ask you
this, but you've never...

07:52.510 --> 07:55.860
Filmed yourself performing a sexual
act, ever, with Ellen or--or anyone?

07:55.870 --> 07:56.790
No.

07:56.800 --> 07:58.010
Not with Carmelita?

07:58.020 --> 08:00.290
Nick, what part of "no"
do you not understand?

08:00.300 --> 08:01.650
Just be completely honest with me, pat.

08:01.660 --> 08:03.170
I am being completely honest with you.

08:03.180 --> 08:04.910
I never made any sex tape.

08:04.920 --> 08:09.200
I mean, quite frankly, I don't
find them to be very romantic.

08:09.210 --> 08:10.190
Okay.

08:10.200 --> 08:11.530
Uh, well, do you think it's possible that

08:11.540 --> 08:13.720
somebody could've filmed you
without your knowledge for--

08:13.730 --> 08:16.180
Nick, did anyone ever say that
it was actually me on the tape?

08:16.190 --> 08:18.430
Did someone ever--
did they say that?

08:18.440 --> 08:19.990
No.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.690
We just
assumed that--

08:22.410 --> 08:24.450
well, there it is, Nick.

08:24.460 --> 08:27.180
You assume, you make an
ass out of you and me.

08:28.480 --> 08:30.470
That one's for free.

08:32.440 --> 08:34.450
Don't go. I just got home.

08:34.460 --> 08:36.549
I have to. I've gotta go to Russian.

08:36.558 --> 08:38.240
- Don't you mean Russia?
- No.

08:38.250 --> 08:41.110
I started taking Russian for
the space tourism program.

08:41.659 --> 08:46.220
I have to know what
it means if they say...

08:46.230 --> 08:47.390
What does that mean?

08:47.400 --> 08:49.280
Open the air lock, Ivan.

08:49.620 --> 08:52.330
- Catherine, can I please be done unpacking?
- Yes.

08:52.340 --> 08:53.820
Thank you.

08:55.840 --> 08:58.230
What's going on with you lately?

08:58.240 --> 08:59.970
What? Nothing.

09:00.950 --> 09:04.100
I'm sensing some sort of weird vibe.

09:04.450 --> 09:08.790
You know how my twin-tuition gets
really good a month before our birthday?

09:08.800 --> 09:10.710
There's no such thing as twin-tuition.

09:10.720 --> 09:12.270
Yes, there is...

09:12.280 --> 09:13.760
And you know it.

09:13.770 --> 09:17.930
Like the time you fell into the wall
at Elton John's estate, and I knew,

09:17.940 --> 09:21.930
or when you broke your wrist
at tennis camp, and I knew.

09:21.940 --> 09:23.240
I called you from my cell phone.

09:23.250 --> 09:26.780
Yeah, but I knew you were gonna call.

09:33.090 --> 09:36.120
So you think Simon elder, the
billionaire philanthropist,

09:36.130 --> 09:37.870
blew up your father's plane?

09:37.880 --> 09:39.390
I'm exploring the possibility.

09:39.400 --> 09:43.850
The guy who loves everybody and
stamps out hunger and a. I. D. S.

09:43.860 --> 09:46.320
And everything had it
in for your dear old dad?

09:46.330 --> 09:48.580
Do you know where I
might find Angelina Adams?

09:48.590 --> 09:51.090
She was the detective that I
spoke with at the crash site.

09:51.100 --> 09:52.210
She got transferred.

09:52.220 --> 09:54.370
So what was his motive, you think?

09:54.380 --> 09:56.180
Did your father even know mr.Elder?

09:56.190 --> 09:57.280
I'm not sure.

09:57.290 --> 10:00.390
I'm just asking you can look and
see if there's a possible connection.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.830
Look, a-all of this was
in my father's briefcase.

10:02.840 --> 10:04.120
There's--there's
evidence here that

10:04.130 --> 10:07.850
elder's application for alien employment
certification was tampered with

10:07.860 --> 10:09.860
when he entered the country
from Russia back in 1979.

10:09.870 --> 10:12.520
And--and here on his
information disclosure statement,

10:12.530 --> 10:14.900
which he signed when he
patented his prism processor,

10:14.910 --> 10:17.210
he failed to disclose prior art.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.600
Do you know what that means?

10:19.610 --> 10:21.070
Could've been someone else's idea?

10:21.080 --> 10:25.270
It could be he stole someone else's
idea and my father knew about it.

10:26.710 --> 10:27.630
You know what, Mr. George?

10:27.640 --> 10:28.860
Can I keep ts for a day?

10:28.870 --> 10:29.560
Yeah, sure.

10:29.570 --> 10:32.260
And I'll have our people look 'em
over, and we'll get back to you.

10:32.270 --> 10:34.270
I mean, look, it may mean nothing.

10:34.280 --> 10:35.870
It may. You never know.

10:36.210 --> 10:37.210
It may.

10:38.230 --> 10:40.040
I'll call you tomorrow.

10:48.310 --> 10:49.530
Hey, Daisy, I'll be there in ten.

10:49.540 --> 10:51.570
Rebecca colfax, family publicist.

10:51.580 --> 10:53.360
You ever get tired of saying that?

10:53.370 --> 10:56.110
Our aussie friend just sent me an
e-mail outling his requirements.

10:56.120 --> 10:59.080
He wants the money hand
delivered, 5:00 P.M.Tomorrow,pier 21,

10:59.090 --> 11:01.780
exactly one hour before the
campaign launch at bulgari.

11:01.790 --> 11:04.210
And we know the tape
exists now, Einstein.

11:04.220 --> 11:06.120
There was an audio file
attached to the e-mail.

11:06.130 --> 11:07.830
A recording of the sex tape, huh?

11:07.840 --> 11:08.550
Yeah.

11:08.560 --> 11:11.710
It's pretty rough, but you can
definitely hear someone say "Patty,"

11:11.720 --> 11:14.670
and it sounds about 50% like a dude.

11:14.680 --> 11:16.180
Well, I've spoken with Patrick.

11:16.190 --> 11:16.950
And?

11:16.960 --> 11:18.510
And he claims he never made a sex tape.

11:18.520 --> 11:19.830
Says they're not romantic.

11:19.840 --> 11:23.860
Let me let you in on a little
secret about the Darlings, Nick.

11:23.870 --> 11:25.070
They lie.

11:40.710 --> 11:42.590
So I'm just asking you
to be honest with me.

11:42.600 --> 11:44.820
Have you ever made a sex tape?

11:45.290 --> 11:46.900
Nick...

11:49.440 --> 11:51.730
I-I tell you this with, um...

11:52.560 --> 11:54.870
With a great sorrow.

11:55.510 --> 11:56.560
But...

11:56.570 --> 11:59.970
The only sex tapes I ever had
were the ones in my collection.

11:59.980 --> 12:01.660
But you've never made a sex tape?

12:01.670 --> 12:03.250
You mean like a mix tape?

12:03.260 --> 12:05.380
Like the one you made
me when we were 12,

12:05.390 --> 12:07.160
the one with "babe, I love you" on it.

12:07.170 --> 12:08.660
Babe, I love you

12:08.670 --> 12:10.940
no, Karen, a sex tape.

12:10.950 --> 12:12.100
That's impossible.

12:12.110 --> 12:13.340
What do you mean, impossible?

12:13.350 --> 12:15.160
Just that.

12:15.760 --> 12:17.870
It is not possible.

12:17.880 --> 12:19.100
Okay.

12:19.110 --> 12:21.210
So you had a collection of sex tapes?

12:21.220 --> 12:22.250
Yeah, but they were not of me.

12:22.260 --> 12:24.590
They were of, like, celebrities.

12:24.600 --> 12:25.680
Remember?

12:25.690 --> 12:27.610
Babe, I love you

12:27.620 --> 12:30.790
Nick, if I tell you something,

12:30.800 --> 12:32.890
do you promise not to tell anybody?

12:32.900 --> 12:35.440
You have a sex tape of buddy ebsen?

12:35.850 --> 12:37.570
Had.

12:37.970 --> 12:40.630
It's probably Juliet.

12:40.920 --> 12:43.020
I'm a virgin.

12:45.420 --> 12:47.250
That--that's--
that's a surprise.

12:47.260 --> 12:50.180
Uh, a real, total virgin?

12:50.190 --> 12:51.550
Yeah.

12:51.560 --> 12:53.570
I've never even...

12:55.080 --> 12:56.810
Well, anything.

12:56.820 --> 12:58.050
Well, Juliet, why
do you--

12:58.060 --> 12:59.710
let everyone think I'm a slut?

12:59.720 --> 13:00.750
Yeah.

13:00.760 --> 13:02.660
It's easier.

13:02.960 --> 13:05.190
Okay, just to be sure...

13:05.700 --> 13:10.410
Not even any kissing or touching or
heavy petting while a camera was on?

13:10.990 --> 13:13.600
How do you live with yourself?

13:14.510 --> 13:15.650
They all said no.

13:15.660 --> 13:16.370
Told ya.

13:16.380 --> 13:17.860
Patrick made the sex
tape. Patrick's lying.

13:17.870 --> 13:21.890
Patrick's going to be the next lying president
of the United States of lying America.

13:22.940 --> 13:24.880
Birds roost with their own kind.

13:24.890 --> 13:29.150
So honesty will come home
to those who practice it.

13:29.740 --> 13:30.770
Amen.

13:30.780 --> 13:32.640
Amen.

13:35.930 --> 13:37.730
You speak English?

13:37.740 --> 13:40.120
No, he doesn't.

13:40.360 --> 13:42.270
Not a word.

13:43.490 --> 13:45.490
He saw me reading the Bible.

13:45.500 --> 13:48.550
And "amen" is the same in Sweden.

13:48.560 --> 13:51.080
Amen, right?

13:51.090 --> 13:53.000
Amen?

13:53.010 --> 13:53.940
Amen.

13:53.950 --> 13:55.980
See, it's the same in Sweden.

14:03.290 --> 14:06.090
Honey, I'm as sorry
about this as you are.

14:10.830 --> 14:13.180
I feel like a piece of trash.

14:13.630 --> 14:15.350
You're not a piece of trash.

14:15.360 --> 14:16.670
I know.

14:16.680 --> 14:18.570
You just make me feel like one.

14:18.580 --> 14:19.370
Me?

14:19.380 --> 14:21.290
You're the one that told me to run.

14:21.300 --> 14:24.930
Yeah, but I didn't-- I didn't
think you'd break up with me.

14:24.940 --> 14:28.310
I thought they were two
totally different issues.

14:28.320 --> 14:30.030
Obviously they're not.

14:30.040 --> 14:31.880
Wait, don't-- please
don't go. Stay.

14:31.890 --> 14:33.360
I can't.

14:33.370 --> 14:36.260
Can't we just have one last nice time?

14:38.350 --> 14:40.290
We already did.

14:40.300 --> 14:42.290
We just didn't know it.

14:53.190 --> 14:54.940
Hey, Rebecca colfax, family publicist.

14:54.950 --> 14:56.100
We know.

14:56.110 --> 14:59.080
Once we set your meeting with our
aussie slime, he sent the dinky-di.

14:59.090 --> 15:00.460
Dinky-di?

15:00.470 --> 15:02.390
It's aussie for "the real thing.

15:02.400 --> 15:05.310
It goes public day after tomorrow
unless we come up with the moola.

15:05.320 --> 15:06.590
That means "money.

15:07.250 --> 15:09.650
It's showtime, folks.

15:11.910 --> 15:14.220
What the hell are they doing?

15:14.630 --> 15:16.420
The Italian banker.

15:16.430 --> 15:17.900
How do you know that?

15:17.910 --> 15:20.600
Uh, the reverse Italian banker.

15:21.190 --> 15:22.350
Oh, caddie.

15:22.360 --> 15:25.320
Well, I hate to say it, but I guess
you were right about the lying.

15:25.960 --> 15:27.740
Good thing it's not Patrick.

15:27.750 --> 15:28.770
Well, it's good for him.

15:28.780 --> 15:29.950
It's the same for the campaign.

15:29.960 --> 15:32.320
It's-- the Darling family name
is still the Darling family name.

15:32.330 --> 15:34.550
We've still gotta pay.

15:35.660 --> 15:37.140
Oh, my God!

15:37.150 --> 15:38.028
Just turn it off!

15:52.620 --> 15:54.450
Any luck with the police?

15:54.460 --> 15:55.460
Yeah.

15:55.470 --> 15:56.860
Provisionally, actually.

15:56.870 --> 15:57.940
They're gonna look into it.

15:57.950 --> 16:00.910
You showed 'em the documents
that were in your dad's briefcase?

16:00.920 --> 16:03.460
I did, and they're gonna look 'em over.

16:03.470 --> 16:04.390
The originals?

16:04.400 --> 16:05.970
No, of course not. Copies.

16:06.840 --> 16:10.330
Oh, well, I mean, it's a
surprise, but it's--it's a good one.

16:10.340 --> 16:11.860
I'm pleased.

16:12.440 --> 16:15.920
You still don't believe, do you, that
I had nothing to do with this?

16:15.930 --> 16:18.490
Honestly, uh, I'm not sure.

16:18.500 --> 16:20.330
Secretary of state for you, sir.

16:20.340 --> 16:22.170
Thank you, Helen.

16:22.570 --> 16:24.820
Your dad was my roommate at Yale.

16:24.830 --> 16:26.470
He was my best friend, ever.

16:26.480 --> 16:27.730
Tripp, don't you need to get that?

16:27.740 --> 16:29.240
In a second.

16:29.250 --> 16:33.160
He was the first person I hired when
my dad put me in charge of the family.

16:33.170 --> 16:36.480
He saved me from certain death twice,

16:36.490 --> 16:40.310
once in the Mentawais islands and once when
we were up in saskatchewan hunting moose.

16:40.320 --> 16:42.020
I took a stray bullet in the leg.

16:42.030 --> 16:46.470
He carried me on his back
6 1/2 Miles to the lodge.

16:47.540 --> 16:51.120
There is no way that I
would've wanted him dead.

16:53.700 --> 16:57.300
Not even knowing he had an affair
with your wife for 40 years?

17:00.120 --> 17:02.260
I didn't know.

17:05.540 --> 17:08.980
You're gonna have to start
trusting me sometime or...

17:09.290 --> 17:12.430
This--this is
not gonna work.

17:13.250 --> 17:14.680
Tripp Darling.

17:15.670 --> 17:17.790
Hey, Condi.

17:17.800 --> 17:22.319
No, I-I had the occasion to hear
your cousin constance speak.

17:22.329 --> 17:25.130
Wh-what clarity of vision.

17:25.140 --> 17:29.490
What--what an extraordinary family
you have, madam secretary. Yeah.

17:29.500 --> 17:31.180
She was thrilling.

17:44.210 --> 17:46.120
It is your sister again.

17:46.130 --> 17:47.780
Will you grab it for me?

17:48.170 --> 17:50.370
She'll just keep calling if you don't.

17:50.380 --> 17:52.090
Jeremy. Hmm?

17:52.500 --> 17:56.390
You're a very handsome, very cool guy.

17:57.110 --> 18:00.440
You don't need your
sister 24 hours a day.

18:00.450 --> 18:01.420
Disconnect.

18:01.430 --> 18:04.430
Last time we did it, you
talked to lilo the whole time.

18:04.440 --> 18:05.930
That was different.

18:05.940 --> 18:08.260
She was bummed.

18:13.060 --> 18:14.000
Hey, sis.

18:14.010 --> 18:16.160
I've left, like, three messages.

18:16.170 --> 18:18.710
I'm sorry. I've been kind of tied up.

18:19.240 --> 18:21.120
What are you doing?

18:21.130 --> 18:23.340
I'm chillin' with some freaks.

18:23.350 --> 18:25.790
What should I wear tonight
to the campaign launch?

18:25.800 --> 18:28.170
A burnoose or something. Shake it up.

18:28.180 --> 18:30.550
Jeremy, are you even listening to me?

18:32.660 --> 18:33.380
Jeremy?

18:33.390 --> 18:34.800
Yeah, I'm listening.

18:34.810 --> 18:37.350
Fine.Whatever.Perf.Bye.

18:37.360 --> 18:38.430
Bye.

18:43.570 --> 18:45.840
This--this is not
gonna end well.

18:45.850 --> 18:47.840
So, all right, I made a sex tape.

18:47.850 --> 18:49.430
It's not like it's against the law.

18:49.440 --> 18:51.490
Well, I'm not saying it's
against the law, Karen.

18:51.500 --> 18:54.350
It's just, you--youied
to me.

18:57.050 --> 18:58.200
I hurt your feelings.

18:58.210 --> 18:59.510
- No, Karen- -
oh, I'm sorry, Nick.

18:59.520 --> 19:01.480
I-I won't do that again.

19:01.490 --> 19:02.770
Who's the y?

19:02.780 --> 19:04.040
Why?

19:04.050 --> 19:04.770
You a little jealous?

19:04.780 --> 19:06.270
- Karen- - just
a little bit?

19:06.280 --> 19:11.070
Look, Karen, I am just trying to figure out a way to
get around shelling out $1 million for this thing.

19:11.080 --> 19:12.170
That's it.

19:12.400 --> 19:14.690
Okay. It's Freddy's caddie.

19:15.290 --> 19:16.210
What?

19:16.220 --> 19:18.310
It's Freddy's caddie.

19:18.320 --> 19:20.170
Freddy's caddie?

19:20.680 --> 19:21.830
Oh, well, that explains that.

19:21.840 --> 19:22.530
Explains what?

19:22.540 --> 19:23.300
Caddie. Patty.

19:23.310 --> 19:25.140
- Uh, nothing. Nothing.
- Okay.

19:25.650 --> 19:26.710
I just...

19:26.720 --> 19:30.580
I need you to promise me that
he won't find out about this.

19:30.590 --> 19:31.360
Freddy?

19:31.370 --> 19:33.250
No. Daddy.

19:33.260 --> 19:34.760
He doesn't know it's
me on the tape, right?

19:34.770 --> 19:36.490
He doesn't know there's tape.

19:36.500 --> 19:38.820
So you lied for me?

19:40.370 --> 19:41.690
Yeah, I omitted a few things.

19:41.700 --> 19:44.520
Nick... thank you.

19:44.530 --> 19:46.940
You are so sweet.

19:48.980 --> 19:50.090
All right, here's
what you need to do--

19:50.100 --> 19:54.080
go to the bowery branch at Fortunato
brothers and ask for Paulo Vova.

19:54.090 --> 19:55.350
Paulo Vova?

19:55.360 --> 19:57.260
And he's just gonna give me $1 million?

19:57.270 --> 19:57.960
He's never met me.

19:57.970 --> 20:01.240
Well, Nick, if I go in and ask him for money
to pay off a blackmailer for a sex tape,

20:01.250 --> 20:04.610
he's just gonna go and tell
daddy like he did last time.

20:04.620 --> 20:05.550
Really appreciate this.

20:05.560 --> 20:06.820
I know it's short notice.

20:06.830 --> 20:08.410
Not at a, Mr. George.

20:08.420 --> 20:10.510
This is why we're here.

20:10.730 --> 20:13.620
I was very sorry, by the
way, to hear about your father.

20:13.630 --> 20:14.990
We were friends.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.980
He was...

20:16.990 --> 20:18.740
He was a good man.

20:18.750 --> 20:20.600
Thank yo

20:35.670 --> 20:37.950
all of this money
belongs to the Darlings?

20:37.960 --> 20:39.220
Si.

20:39.230 --> 20:41.990
And the have vaults like
this all over the city.

20:45.650 --> 20:48.300
- Do I need to tell
you why- - no.No.

20:48.630 --> 20:50.960
Is none of my business, Mr. George.

20:50.970 --> 20:52.360
I never asked your father.

20:52.370 --> 20:54.260
I will never ask you.

21:03.420 --> 21:05.130
Thank you, paolo.

21:05.460 --> 21:08.940
Mr. Vova, please. I'm a banker.

21:10.280 --> 21:12.460
An Italian banker.

21:12.470 --> 21:15.950
Yes, I am very familiar
with the sexual position.

21:16.740 --> 21:20.180
It was named for my grandfather.

21:20.470 --> 21:23.840
Okay enough.

21:28.190 --> 21:29.800
Thanks, Steven.

21:29.810 --> 21:33.190
Do you know how much love I've
given up to be in this family...

21:38.570 --> 21:41.270
To be who my dad wants me to be?

21:42.270 --> 21:46.240
How much love and simple affection?

21:50.480 --> 21:52.100
Sweet nectar.

21:52.110 --> 21:54.500
Mr. Darling, you have a speech
to make in less than an hour.

21:54.510 --> 21:58.110
Enough love for ten lifetimes.

21:59.840 --> 22:02.230
Two more potcheens, Steven.

22:02.240 --> 22:06.420
Funny thing is, I'm not allowed
to be loved for who I really am.

22:08.500 --> 22:10.210
Poor people...

22:10.840 --> 22:11.750
Nobodies...

22:11.760 --> 22:15.930
Regular beings that only God sees, they
can be loved for who they are, but not me.

22:15.940 --> 22:17.620
Because you know why?

22:17.630 --> 22:19.070
We should really go, sir.

22:19.080 --> 22:20.790
Because I'm a scion.

22:21.640 --> 22:26.480
I'm a Darling twig, a tender
sot that's stuck to a tree...

22:27.430 --> 22:29.760
That I cannot live without.

22:31.290 --> 22:33.860
So... here's to the tree.

22:33.870 --> 22:36.270
Here's to the tree, Clark.

22:37.170 --> 22:39.320
Here's to the tree...

22:40.480 --> 22:42.780
That's killing me.

22:43.340 --> 22:44.170
Come on.

22:44.180 --> 22:45.870
Let's go, Mr. Darling.

22:45.880 --> 22:48.230
Okay. I'm gonna drive, though.

22:48.520 --> 22:50.720
I'm at least gonna
be in control of that.

22:50.730 --> 22:53.040
Sir. Sir.

22:57.250 --> 22:59.130
Come on.

23:02.210 --> 23:03.500
Hey.

23:05.800 --> 23:08.130
Are you Mr. George?

23:08.450 --> 23:09.790
Yeah.

23:12.160 --> 23:13.280
Where's your boyfriend?

23:13.290 --> 23:15.690
Something came up so he sent me.

23:15.700 --> 23:16.470
All right, fine. Whatever.

23:16.480 --> 23:18.010
Where's the tape?

23:18.020 --> 23:19.000
I'm sorry.

23:19.010 --> 23:20.960
This is really awkward.

23:21.770 --> 23:23.040
What the hell is going on?

23:23.050 --> 23:24.640
We can't sell you the tape.

23:24.650 --> 23:26.470
What do you mean, you
can't sell me the tape

23:26.480 --> 23:28.190
we don't have it no more.

23:28.200 --> 23:29.250
You've gotta be kidding me.

23:29.260 --> 23:30.750
I just went and got $1 million.

23:30.760 --> 23:32.230
I have $1 million in this bag.

23:32.240 --> 23:32.750
I know!

23:32.760 --> 23:34.990
Look, maybe we could go and
get a cup of tea or something--

23:35.000 --> 23:36.310
no, we can't go get a cup of tea!

23:36.320 --> 23:39.050
I'm in a hurry. I have to be at
a police station in ten minutes.

23:39.060 --> 23:39.860
What, about this?

23:39.870 --> 23:41.340
No, about something else entirely.

23:41.350 --> 23:43.360
So if you're playing some
kind of game with me--

23:43.370 --> 23:44.360
I'm not.

23:44.370 --> 23:46.680
We feel really blood
awful about this, Mr. George.

23:46.690 --> 23:47.960
This is not how we do business.

23:47.970 --> 23:50.120
It's just that we got
a much bigger offer.

23:50.130 --> 23:51.130
From who?

23:51.140 --> 23:52.270
Who did you sell this tape to?

23:52.280 --> 23:54.240
I don't know. We never even met them.

23:54.250 --> 23:57.160
We just got a phone Cal out of
the blue giving us instructions.

23:57.170 --> 24:00.380
Put the tape into a
postbox, and that was that.

24:00.750 --> 24:02.270
God help me.

24:02.280 --> 24:05.840
Well, I hope this doesn't affect any
future business that we might do, Mr. George.

24:05.850 --> 24:07.960
Oh, I'm sure it won't.

24:09.100 --> 24:10.750
No, it's all good!

24:10.760 --> 24:11.610
That's it? You're done?

24:11.620 --> 24:13.210
We looked at the materials, Mr. George,

24:13.220 --> 24:15.950
and there's nothing in there that
really incriminates Simon elder.

24:15.960 --> 24:17.580
And you did all of this in one day?

24:17.590 --> 24:21.130
Look, you said yourself that the stuff from
your father's briefcase may not mean anything.

24:21.140 --> 24:23.220
And your instinct were
right on the money.

24:23.230 --> 24:25.280
Did detective Adams get
transferred off this case

24:25.290 --> 24:28.970
because she was willing to look into things
that you're obviously being paid not to?

24:28.980 --> 24:32.830
Detective Adams followed her
actor boyfriend to Los Angeles.

24:32.840 --> 24:34.430
What are you gonna do?

24:34.440 --> 24:36.320
Women.

24:40.490 --> 24:41.700
Hello.

24:41.710 --> 24:43.780
Uh, Mr. George? Yeah.

24:43.790 --> 24:45.440
It's Clark, the driver.

24:45.450 --> 24:46.940
Hey, Clark. What's up?

24:46.950 --> 24:50.790
I'm up here at, uh, 86th and 2nd Avenue.

24:50.800 --> 24:52.500
Yeah. What's the problem?

24:52.510 --> 24:54.860
I've got Patrick up here.

24:54.870 --> 24:56.710
He's, uh...

24:58.450 --> 25:01.000
I'm not going, Nicky! I won't go!

25:01.840 --> 25:03.270
He's in a bit of a state.

25:03.280 --> 25:04.690
Tell him I'm not going!

25:04.700 --> 25:06.720
I'll be there as soon as I can.

25:49.580 --> 25:51.060
Hey, there's his wife.

25:51.070 --> 25:51.970
Hey, Ellen!

25:51.980 --> 25:53.910
Ellen, Ellen, where is the candidate?

25:53.920 --> 25:55.120
Oh, he'll be here shortly.

25:55.130 --> 25:57.170
He's just putting some
last touches on his speech.

25:57.180 --> 25:58.420
Thank you.

26:06.540 --> 26:07.400
Juliet, right here!

26:07.410 --> 26:08.900
Bonsoir.

26:18.800 --> 26:21.460
Oh, my God.

26:21.940 --> 26:22.920
Oh, my God.

26:22.930 --> 26:24.120
What is she doing here?

26:24.130 --> 26:26.010
She, uh, she must be a supporter.

26:27.720 --> 26:28.600
Natalie kimpton!

26:28.610 --> 26:32.590
Does your appearance at Patrick Darling's
fund-raiser mean that you and Juliet have made up?

26:32.600 --> 26:35.890
When she's ready to
apologize, I'm ready to listen.

26:36.290 --> 26:38.400
This is so utterly debasing.

26:38.410 --> 26:39.560
We have to get her off the list.

26:39.570 --> 26:41.380
She's already on the red carpet, Jules.

26:41.390 --> 26:42.270
Oh, God!

26:42.280 --> 26:43.640
Oh, I want to go home!

26:43.650 --> 26:45.380
No, no, no. Look, it's a big store.

26:45.390 --> 26:46.760
It's a big store. You
won't even see her. Okay?

26:46.770 --> 26:48.390
Trust me.

26:51.440 --> 26:53.320
Go, Patrick!

26:54.450 --> 26:55.780
Thanks for not taking him in.

26:55.790 --> 26:56.710
No problem.

26:56.720 --> 26:58.870
I used to do the same
thing for your dad.

26:58.880 --> 27:01.290
Helps keep the press out of the picture.

27:02.830 --> 27:04.470
Patrick.

27:05.450 --> 27:06.590
Nick, how you doing?

27:06.600 --> 27:08.330
You were supposed to be
at bulgari 20 minutes ago.

27:08.340 --> 27:10.190
You're giving a speech
ten minutes from now.

27:10.200 --> 27:12.640
Oh, no, I'm not.

27:12.650 --> 27:13.450
Patrick.

27:13.460 --> 27:15.710
I can't do it without her.

27:15.720 --> 27:18.930
I'm really sorry about this, guys, but
I'm gonna have to take someone in.

27:18.940 --> 27:20.270
Too many witnesses.

27:20.280 --> 27:21.680
I got it.

27:21.690 --> 27:22.930
What are you doing, Clark?

27:22.940 --> 27:24.760
Standard procedure. I'll be fine.

27:24.770 --> 27:27.610
How the hell are we gonna get you
to this fund-raiser in seven minutes?

27:27.620 --> 27:29.670
We'll get you there, Mr. George.

27:31.740 --> 27:33.630
Do you know what
Carmelita did for me once?

27:33.640 --> 27:35.440
I don't think I want to hear.

27:35.450 --> 27:39.280
She made me 30 pairs of underwear
with my favorite Yankees on the butt--

27:39.290 --> 27:42.010
thurman, Reggie, yogi.

27:42.020 --> 27:44.420
Th-that's love.

27:45.340 --> 27:47.120
What kind of a jerk throws that away?

27:47.130 --> 27:49.100
All right, pat, listen, you got
to pull yourself together.

27:49.110 --> 27:51.380
Don't you tell me to
pull myself together, Nick,

27:51.390 --> 27:53.580
because that's what my dad always says.

27:53.590 --> 27:54.970
Pull yourself together, pat.

27:54.980 --> 27:55.870
Pull yourself together, pat.

27:55.880 --> 27:57.070
All right. I'm sorry.

27:57.080 --> 27:58.240
I mean, that's why your dad was so cool.

27:58.250 --> 28:00.980
He never told anybody to
pull themselves together.

28:00.990 --> 28:05.500
He would say,"let
yourself go," you know?

28:05.940 --> 28:07.970
I love that.

28:08.990 --> 28:10.990
God, it's so exhausting, Nick...

28:11.920 --> 28:13.800
Always disappointing him.

28:14.160 --> 28:16.970
I mean, I can't even imagine what
it's like to just be yourself,

28:16.980 --> 28:20.150
to just do something and have
your dad say, you know,"great job.

28:20.160 --> 28:22.950
You... y-you...

28:22.960 --> 28:24.580
You're good.

28:25.020 --> 28:26.800
It's great, right?

28:26.810 --> 28:28.780
It's a great feeling?

28:29.770 --> 28:31.860
Yeah, I guess.

28:32.270 --> 28:34.690
Dutch was so-- was
so proud of you, Nick.

28:34.700 --> 28:36.190
You must know that, right?

28:36.200 --> 28:38.230
I know he was proud of me.

28:40.480 --> 28:43.410
I didn't give him very many
opportunities to say it.

28:46.200 --> 28:49.320
Does anybody get life right?

28:49.750 --> 28:51.460
I don't know.

28:54.420 --> 28:58.030
I just know that no
matter what, tomorrow...

28:59.120 --> 29:03.340
Is another day, another
opportunity, another chance.

29:06.060 --> 29:08.160
I like that.

29:09.230 --> 29:11.110
He speaks English.

29:11.520 --> 29:12.420
Who?

29:12.430 --> 29:14.460
The
orphan--Gustav?

29:14.470 --> 29:15.240
Complimentary watch?

29:15.250 --> 29:17.520
And very well, not just "amen.

29:17.530 --> 29:19.440
No, thank you.

29:19.450 --> 29:20.790
Oh, wait...

29:22.220 --> 29:23.190
Thanks.

29:23.200 --> 29:25.340
Well, what did he say?

29:25.350 --> 29:27.570
He said to the twins,

29:27.580 --> 29:32.270
"how come the sponge eats burgers
underwater and the buns don't get soggy?

29:32.280 --> 29:33.400
Really?

29:34.630 --> 29:36.560
That lying little street urchin.

29:36.570 --> 29:38.180
Who knows if he's even an orphan?

29:38.190 --> 29:41.290
I'm gonna talk to him, and
I'm gonna find out.

29:41.750 --> 29:44.600
This really cheeses me off.

29:44.610 --> 29:45.970
What do you think of these?

29:45.980 --> 29:48.170
Transplendent.

29:48.590 --> 29:50.360
Wait, what about these?

29:50.370 --> 29:52.700
Even better. Maximum.

29:52.710 --> 29:54.550
You don't think they're too big?

29:54.560 --> 29:56.620
Well, you--you look
a little like a fly,

29:56.630 --> 29:59.010
but that--that's not
all bad. Bugs are cool.

30:02.700 --> 30:03.770
I can't focus.

30:03.780 --> 30:05.030
Maybe they're prescription?

30:05.040 --> 30:07.510
Having Natalie here
is driving me insane.

30:07.520 --> 30:09.210
I'm getting shingles.

30:09.220 --> 30:11.130
You just go ahead and
you forget about her.

30:11.140 --> 30:12.690
I can't.

30:12.700 --> 30:15.340
Not with every third yahoo
in here coming up to me,

30:15.350 --> 30:17.460
making sure I know she's here.

30:17.470 --> 30:18.590
Throw her out.

30:18.600 --> 30:21.150
What? I can't.It's not my place.

30:22.050 --> 30:23.570
You like her!

30:23.580 --> 30:26.220
What--is--is this the
whole twin-tuition thing?

30:26.230 --> 30:28.320
Because I think that you
are being kinda jammed.

30:28.330 --> 30:31.730
I don't need twin-tuition
to see you googling her ass.

30:31.740 --> 30:33.270
Don't--don't you
mean "ogling"?

30:33.280 --> 30:35.460
Whatever! I'm gonna throw it out.

30:35.470 --> 30:36.900
No. J--

30:38.400 --> 30:40.990
you can't just kick me out
'cause of some stupid perfume!

30:41.000 --> 30:42.950
Oh, well, it's not about the perfume.

30:43.390 --> 30:44.480
So it's true.

30:44.490 --> 30:47.090
Darling Natalie" was
intended as a joint release?

30:47.100 --> 30:48.130
No!

30:48.140 --> 30:48.800
No!

30:48.810 --> 30:51.530
I always knew it was
gonna be "daring Natalie.

30:51.540 --> 30:53.790
And then she was all,"put
in the 'l,' put in the 'l'.

30:53.800 --> 30:54.930
That is such a lie.

30:54.940 --> 30:57.610
It was supposed to
celebrate our friendship!

31:01.660 --> 31:04.400
Get--get her off
of me! She's feral!

31:04.410 --> 31:07.520
Oh, I don't even care
about your stupid perfume!

31:07.530 --> 31:10.420
You stole my bangs, and
I will never forgive you!

31:10.430 --> 31:11.540
Oh, my God!

31:11.550 --> 31:13.140
Bangs? It's all about bangs?

31:13.150 --> 31:14.400
Who had the bangs first?

31:14.410 --> 31:16.520
You can't even pull off bangs anyway!

31:16.530 --> 31:17.700
- Look at your face!
- What?

31:17.710 --> 31:19.450
That's enough! That's
enough! Settle down, both of you!

31:19.460 --> 31:20.660
- Settle down!
- She started it.

31:20.670 --> 31:22.100
You did! Whore!

31:22.110 --> 31:23.440
Hey, you shut up!

31:23.450 --> 31:26.890
You do not crash my brother's party
and act like such a selfish freak.

31:26.900 --> 31:28.650
It's not cool.

31:33.560 --> 31:36.090
Oh, my God. The police.

31:37.810 --> 31:39.960
Well, at least he's here.

31:41.600 --> 31:42.860
Good evening.

31:42.870 --> 31:47.100
I hope I'm not too late to talk about the
future of the greatest city in America.

31:47.460 --> 31:50.380
So what did I miss?

31:56.165 --> 31:59.905
To all the new families that arrive at
this city every single day from places

32:00.057 --> 32:04.317
like the Dominican Republic
and Russia, China, Jamaica,

32:04.327 --> 32:06.397
my message remains the same.

32:07.477 --> 32:11.197
Tomorrow is another
day, another opportunity,

32:11.207 --> 32:14.647
another chance at the American dream.

32:14.657 --> 32:16.877
So I thank you very much.
Thank you for coming.

32:16.887 --> 32:18.697
And God bless America.

32:18.707 --> 32:19.277
Thank you.

32:19.287 --> 32:20.627
He's wonderful.

32:32.817 --> 32:34.007
Hey, Karen.

32:34.657 --> 32:37.327
Karen, I'm sorry to bother
you guys, but can we talk?

32:37.337 --> 32:39.577
Yeah. A-about what?

32:39.587 --> 32:40.487
Oh, we're going to get Sushi.

32:40.497 --> 32:41.827
- You can just come and join us.
- No, no, no, no.

32:41.837 --> 32:43.317
It's about the thing.

32:43.577 --> 32:44.757
The sex tape?

32:44.767 --> 32:46.147
Yeah. What, you told him?

32:46.157 --> 32:47.387
She t--she
told you?

32:47.397 --> 32:49.567
Well, I'm giving her a mulligan.

32:51.807 --> 32:52.817
That's--
that's generous.

32:52.827 --> 32:55.657
Well, see, now that's the
difference between you and me, Nick.

32:55.667 --> 32:57.977
I realize that nobody's perfect.

32:57.987 --> 32:59.847
You, you're still trying.

33:01.347 --> 33:04.027
Karen, someone else bought the tape.

33:05.117 --> 33:06.237
- Who?
- I don't know.

33:06.247 --> 33:08.457
And it's gonna be all over the
Internet tomorrow. I'm sorry.

33:08.467 --> 33:09.927
I did everything I could.

33:09.937 --> 33:11.477
Baby, don't worry about
it. You'll survive.

33:11.487 --> 33:13.207
I know, but daddy...

33:17.957 --> 33:20.187
Well, look, if you want
me to, I'll tell him.

33:20.197 --> 33:21.567
- Would you?
- Sure.

33:21.577 --> 33:23.847
Oh, you're the best.

33:23.857 --> 33:25.587
Oh, um...

33:25.937 --> 33:29.767
Tell him I-I didn't know
there was a camera, okay?

33:30.487 --> 33:32.067
- Okay
- okay.

33:32.077 --> 33:33.457
Thank you.

33:42.467 --> 33:44.757
I wish we had a pool up here.

33:44.767 --> 33:46.787
That'd be amazing.

33:47.887 --> 33:50.277
Little sore from your fisticuffs?

33:50.287 --> 33:51.907
Yeah, a little bit.

33:51.917 --> 33:54.407
I think I pulled a muscle.

33:54.417 --> 33:59.427
But it was worth it because I think
I definitely connected a few times.

33:59.437 --> 34:00.687
Yeah?

34:00.697 --> 34:02.497
She's probably gonna have a shiner.

34:02.497 --> 34:05.227
- Oh, yes.
- At lea a skinned knee.

34:09.226 --> 34:11.206
Thank you for sticking up for me.

34:11.217 --> 34:13.266
She was out of line. It's no big thing.

34:13.275 --> 34:16.226
Well, it was huge.

34:16.545 --> 34:18.627
It was the best.

34:19.127 --> 34:22.726
I'm sorry that I said I
thought you had a ing for her.

34:23.976 --> 34:27.065
Guess my twin-tuition's off this year.

34:27.467 --> 34:33.197
Maybe us twins get older
and grow further apart.

34:33.847 --> 34:35.927
They just get out of sync.

34:35.937 --> 34:38.255
Yeah, it could happen.

34:41.065 --> 34:42.937
Who's that?

34:46.746 --> 34:48.315
Take it.

34:48.327 --> 34:49.775
Nah.

34:55.045 --> 34:57.787
- This is nice.
- Yeah.

35:06.507 --> 35:08.647
Nick. Nick.

35:12.117 --> 35:14.747
I just wanted to say thank you, Nick.

35:14.757 --> 35:17.347
I could've never given that
speech tonight without you.

35:17.357 --> 35:18.497
Well, I'm glad I could help.

35:18.507 --> 35:21.817
And that thing you said about tomorrow
being another day, another chance?

35:21.827 --> 35:22.687
Yeah.

35:22.697 --> 35:25.307
Well, you're right, Nick.

35:25.317 --> 35:27.877
I'm getting back
together with Carmelita.

35:29.437 --> 35:31.677
Well, pat, that--that's not
what I meant when I said--

35:31.687 --> 35:34.017
you're good for a wise word, Nick, but...

35:34.027 --> 35:35.717
You can't hold me tight.

35:35.727 --> 35:37.157
Well, can you just...

35:37.167 --> 35:39.887
Give it a beat, think it through?

35:40.737 --> 35:43.247
He has thought it through.

35:44.697 --> 35:46.607
What can I tell you?

35:46.857 --> 35:48.457
It's love.

35:52.227 --> 35:54.537
Let yourself go, pat.

35:54.867 --> 35:57.187
Thanks, Nick. I will.

36:11.207 --> 36:12.487
Dude, you're leaving?

36:12.497 --> 36:14.347
What, are you going back to Vegas?

36:14.357 --> 36:16.657
Why should I stay here in traitorville?

36:16.667 --> 36:18.007
She's my sister.

36:18.017 --> 36:20.507
Really? And what am I, some
freak you chill with?

36:21.107 --> 36:22.617
I think you're overreacting.

36:22.627 --> 36:24.287
Really?

36:24.297 --> 36:25.917
I didn't even get any swag.

36:25.927 --> 36:27.507
Oh, I'm sorry.

36:28.547 --> 36:29.797
I brought you this.

36:29.807 --> 36:30.757
One bag?

36:30.767 --> 36:34.667
You take her side, and you show
up here with one little bag?

36:34.677 --> 36:36.937
I'm totally messing with you.

36:40.977 --> 36:43.487
How's this for an apology?

36:44.267 --> 36:46.007
It's a start.

36:50.167 --> 36:52.247
- Young lady.
- Yes.

36:53.267 --> 36:56.047
I just got off the phone with bulgari.

36:56.057 --> 37:00.517
And they wanted to make
sure the delivery was okay.

37:03.597 --> 37:05.397
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

37:05.407 --> 37:10.847
Apparently they shipped someone in this family
hundreds of thousands of dollars of goods.

37:10.857 --> 37:12.167
Well, it wasn't me.

37:12.177 --> 37:16.327
Well, I don't know any other j. Darling

37:16.337 --> 37:19.547
who would spend that
kind of money on jewelry.

37:19.557 --> 37:21.657
Do you?

37:21.977 --> 37:24.747
- No.
- Okay.

37:25.817 --> 37:28.247
Thank you, Darling.

37:31.537 --> 37:34.127
J. Darling, my foot!

37:34.137 --> 37:39.627
I can't believe that you would betray
us like this after all we've done.

37:39.637 --> 37:43.537
I mean, why would you lie about
not being able to speak English?

37:43.547 --> 37:45.677
- But you're the
one- - never mind.

37:45.687 --> 37:47.067
It doesn't matter.

37:47.077 --> 37:51.437
Do you know how much we've spent at the Swedish
market so you could have your precious caviar?

37:51.447 --> 37:52.287
What's caviar?

37:52.297 --> 37:54.627
It's not about the caviar!

37:55.107 --> 37:56.397
It's about...

37:56.407 --> 37:58.697
The time that we've put in.

37:59.227 --> 38:01.577
I mean, is our name even Gustav?

38:01.587 --> 38:04.367
Tell me. Is it?

38:06.087 --> 38:08.287
It is, isn't it?

38:08.297 --> 38:10.187
- Huh?
- Good.

38:10.767 --> 38:13.377
Well, at least you
were honest about that.

38:14.197 --> 38:18.717
But remember, we pay the rent
in this house with honesty.

38:19.487 --> 38:22.937
Don't make me raise your rent.

38:33.367 --> 38:36.537
Do you really believe
his name is Gustav?

38:36.547 --> 38:38.007
What choice do I have?

38:38.017 --> 38:41.347
You know, at some point, you have
to just put your faith in humanity.

38:41.907 --> 38:44.417
I gotta get to Bible study.

38:50.407 --> 38:53.747
You look like the good news
is I've got two days to live,

38:53.757 --> 38:57.447
and the bad news is you were
supposed to tell me yesterday.

38:57.807 --> 38:59.797
That it?

39:02.047 --> 39:05.477
What, exactly? Speak.

39:07.517 --> 39:09.237
The police found something?

39:09.247 --> 39:12.067
No, they were useless. You were right.

39:12.377 --> 39:16.867
I don't know if elder's people got to 'em
or if they're just too scared to try but...

39:17.887 --> 39:19.977
I don't know. You were right.

39:20.787 --> 39:23.647
Are you ready to let me help you?

39:28.977 --> 39:30.407
You lied to me.

39:30.417 --> 39:31.977
What are you talking
about? I never lied to you.

39:31.987 --> 39:33.887
When did I lie to you?

39:33.897 --> 39:37.897
When I opened my father's briefcase with
your wife's birth date as the combination,

39:37.907 --> 39:40.887
you said you knew about the affair.

39:44.417 --> 39:45.827
That wasn't a lie.

39:45.837 --> 39:48.757
Well, then what the hell was it?

39:51.447 --> 39:54.417
- That was a man- - I asked
if you knew, you said you did,

39:54.427 --> 39:56.547
and then you said you didn't.

39:56.557 --> 39:59.397
So--so which is it?
What's--what's the truth?

39:59.407 --> 40:03.787
That was a man trying to save his life.

40:05.947 --> 40:09.907
What'd you want me to
do, tell you that I'd...

40:09.917 --> 40:13.607
Wasted 40 years trusting the two people

40:13.617 --> 40:17.207
I thought were the most important
people in the world? Is that it?

40:18.197 --> 40:20.377
Was that your truth?

40:33.477 --> 40:35.417
I'm sorry.

40:35.427 --> 40:39.197
'Ll figure it out. You help me take care
of my family, and we'll figure it out.

40:39.207 --> 40:42.577
We'll find out who killed
your father. I promise.

40:44.067 --> 40:45.667
All right.

40:46.767 --> 40:48.767
- All right.
- Okay.

40:48.777 --> 40:50.417
What's next?

40:54.017 --> 40:57.247
Well, there's a sex tape
involving a family member

40:57.257 --> 40:59.237
that's gonna come out
on the Internet tomorrow.

40:59.247 --> 41:00.817
Patrick?

41:00.827 --> 41:02.557
No, Karen.

41:15.667 --> 41:18.757
Mr. George, a second of your time.

41:20.147 --> 41:21.627
Can I help you?

41:21.637 --> 41:22.557
Here.

41:22.567 --> 41:25.797
Inside you'll find all copyright documents
pertaining to the Karen Darling sex tape

41:25.807 --> 41:27.547
as well as all remaining copies.

41:27.557 --> 41:29.617
The rights have been officially
transferred to the Darling family,

41:29.627 --> 41:31.497
care of you, Nicholas George,

41:31.507 --> 41:34.917
and there are a host of legal assurances
attached I'm sure you'd approve.

41:37.917 --> 41:39.497
Okay.

41:40.717 --> 41:42.367
Are you the guy that bought it?

41:45.687 --> 41:48.657
No, but my boss did...

41:49.037 --> 41:51.247
For $3 million.

41:51.697 --> 41:53.877
Your boss?

41:54.777 --> 41:56.807
Simon elder.

41:56.862 --> 41:59.451
Yeah, he's not the man you think
he is, and your boss isn't either.
