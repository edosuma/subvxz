...where he was

02:29.361 --> 02:32.663
So far, 5 guards are confirmed dead

02:32.747 --> 02:34.248
from this prison escape.

02:34.315 --> 02:36.149
...from prison
early this morning.

02:36.201 --> 02:39.336
As you may recall,
Carroll was convicted in 2004

02:39.421 --> 02:41.989
for the murders of 14 young women

02:42.040 --> 02:43.424
who attended the university

02:43.491 --> 02:45.793
where he was a professor
of literature...

02:45.844 --> 02:46.827
Hello?

02:46.878 --> 02:49.263
Hello, Ryan.
It's Director Franklin, FBI.

02:49.330 --> 02:50.631
It's been a while.

02:50.682 --> 02:53.300
Yeah. What can
I do for you, sir?

02:53.351 --> 02:56.971
We need you in Virginia, Ryan.

02:57.022 --> 02:58.171
I'm not an agent anymore.

02:58.223 --> 03:00.608
I know things didn't
end well with the Bureau,

03:00.675 --> 03:01.809
but you caught Carroll.

03:01.860 --> 03:03.777
No one knows him like you do.

03:03.845 --> 03:06.030
I've got good agents on it.

03:06.114 --> 03:08.899
Go consult, educate them.

03:08.984 --> 03:11.068
We have to find him fast.

03:11.152 --> 03:13.821
So far, 5 guards are confirmed dead

03:13.872 --> 03:15.289
from the prison escape.

03:15.356 --> 03:17.858
Joe Carroll is still at large.

03:17.909 --> 03:19.526
Will you do it, Ryan?

03:34.629 --> 03:36.827
_

03:37.866 --> 03:40.555
_

03:50.825 --> 03:52.192
Sarah Fuller?

03:53.945 --> 03:56.196
Detective Warren, Norfolk PD.

03:56.248 --> 03:58.398
We're here on behalf
of the US Marshals Office.

03:58.450 --> 04:00.868
Okay.

04:00.919 --> 04:02.369
What's going on?

04:02.420 --> 04:05.589
Joe Carroll-- he escaped from
prison earlier this morning.

04:07.308 --> 04:09.493
I'm sorry. He what?

04:12.247 --> 04:14.365
And where was the knife at this point,

04:14.449 --> 04:17.817
the knife that was used
to stab you repeatedly?

04:20.588 --> 04:23.474
It was still inside me.

04:23.558 --> 04:24.858
I reached down to pull it out,

04:24.926 --> 04:26.360
but I was too weak.

04:26.427 --> 04:29.146
So what did you do?

04:29.230 --> 04:31.932
I pushed it instead

04:31.983 --> 04:34.201
deeper into my stomach
and to the right.

04:34.268 --> 04:35.953
And why would you do that?

04:40.458 --> 04:43.294
To puncture the splenic artery,

04:43.378 --> 04:46.463
to bleed out faster.

04:46.548 --> 04:48.549
I just wanted it to be over.

04:51.386 --> 04:52.753
I have men in place
both inside and out.

04:52.804 --> 04:54.555
Strictly precautionary.

04:54.622 --> 04:55.756
Gonna keep you safe, Miss Fuller.

04:55.807 --> 04:56.840
Whoa!
Can't let you in!

04:56.925 --> 04:57.808
I'm her neighbor Will Wilson.

04:57.892 --> 05:00.561
Will! He's okay--

05:00.628 --> 05:02.629
- Sarah!
- Hey.

05:02.681 --> 05:05.816
I saw the news.
It's all over TV.

05:05.900 --> 05:07.568
Look. Billy's on his
way home, all right?

05:07.635 --> 05:09.853
We're here for you, whatever you need.

05:09.938 --> 05:11.772
I'm so glad you're here.

05:11.823 --> 05:13.407
Come here.

05:32.761 --> 05:36.096
Ryan Harding, Agent Troy Riley, BAU2.

05:36.164 --> 05:37.514
This is Agent Jennifer Mason.

05:37.599 --> 05:38.999
Thank you for coming.

05:39.050 --> 05:40.434
I'm not sure what Franklin told you,

05:40.501 --> 05:41.935
but the Marshals are
heading the ground search,

05:42.003 --> 05:43.220
and we're running point for the Bureau.

05:43.304 --> 05:44.938
We got a command center set up in town.

05:45.006 --> 05:46.774
Now your being here
may raise some eyebrows.

05:46.841 --> 05:48.175
That book you wrote.

05:48.226 --> 05:49.810
Not to mention my reputation.

05:49.861 --> 05:51.695
Just keep your head down,
we'll do the talking.

05:51.780 --> 05:54.064
If anyone asks, you're here
strictly as a consultant.

05:54.149 --> 05:55.182
Any questions?

05:55.233 --> 05:57.951
Yeah?
How's Sarah Fuller?

05:58.019 --> 05:59.352
Carroll's last victim.

05:59.404 --> 06:01.321
She's a doctor now
in Norfolk. She sav--

06:01.373 --> 06:03.023
Yes. She's
under 24/7 watch.

06:03.074 --> 06:04.191
I'd like to speak to her.

06:04.242 --> 06:05.659
About what?

06:05.710 --> 06:08.195
I'd like to know how she's doing.

06:08.246 --> 06:09.529
Perhaps later when we're not trying

06:09.581 --> 06:11.915
to find a serial killer.

06:12.000 --> 06:15.702
He kills all of them
in under two minutes,

06:15.754 --> 06:17.254
and there he goes.

06:26.848 --> 06:29.650
Ryan Hardy, this is
Deputy Marshal Scott Turner.

06:29.717 --> 06:30.651
I know Ryan.

06:30.718 --> 06:31.935
I was with the Sheriff's Office

06:32.020 --> 06:34.021
when he brought Carroll in.

06:34.072 --> 06:35.388
Scott.

06:35.440 --> 06:38.108
Director Franklin
asked Mr. Hardy to consult.

06:38.193 --> 06:40.694
Then he's your problem, Agent.

06:46.901 --> 06:48.619
He left it like this.

06:50.905 --> 06:53.290
Forensics swept.
Nothing.

06:53.374 --> 06:55.259
He's scheduled to be
executed next month.

06:55.343 --> 06:58.595
The 12th.

06:58.680 --> 07:00.597
Still a romantic.

07:09.724 --> 07:10.808
Who let him have this?

07:10.892 --> 07:12.276
Anyone could have.

07:15.230 --> 07:17.097
"Dear Ryan, I enjoyed your book.

07:17.148 --> 07:18.699
Have you ever considered a sequel?

07:18.766 --> 07:20.818
Best, Joe."

07:20.902 --> 07:22.035
You never mentioned a note.

07:22.103 --> 07:23.770
Any idea why he left that for you?

07:23.822 --> 07:26.406
He enjoyed my book.
He said so.

07:26.458 --> 07:28.408
I think he's letting us know
that he plans to kill again.

07:28.460 --> 07:29.960
Yeah. That's
probably it.

07:30.044 --> 07:32.445
Look. I read your file.
I know you don't play well with others.

07:32.497 --> 07:33.947
- You read my file?
- Yes, I did!

07:33.998 --> 07:36.967
So you know me, is that what it is?

07:37.051 --> 07:39.470
Forget it.

07:39.554 --> 07:42.005
Claire Matthews,
Carroll's ex-wife.

07:42.090 --> 07:44.274
Has anyone been in touch with her?

07:44.342 --> 07:46.493
She's being questioned.

07:46.561 --> 07:49.462
We have her under protection, as well.

07:53.184 --> 07:55.369
_

08:03.828 --> 08:05.612
Sorry for the intrusion, Miss Matthews.

08:05.663 --> 08:07.664
I have a few questions.

08:07.749 --> 08:10.083
When was the last time your
husband contacted you?

08:10.151 --> 08:13.653
Ex-husband, and I don't
mean to be rude, Detective,

08:13.705 --> 08:16.039
but I'm gonna wait
for the FBI to arrive,

08:16.124 --> 08:18.458
and I need to speak to Ryan Hardy.

08:20.995 --> 08:22.429
Thank you.

08:35.393 --> 08:36.476
Ohh!

08:36.528 --> 08:37.945
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!

08:38.011 --> 08:40.513
So how'd it go?

08:40.565 --> 08:42.515
It's official.
I'm pregnant.

08:42.567 --> 08:44.150
Ha ha ha!

08:46.687 --> 08:49.239
Mom! Mom!

08:49.324 --> 08:50.290
Yeah. Yeah, honey.

08:50.358 --> 08:52.409
What's going on?

08:52.493 --> 08:54.745
Why can't I watch TV?

08:54.829 --> 08:57.130
I didn't know what to say.

08:57.198 --> 08:58.365
Um...

08:58.416 --> 09:01.501
It's dad, isn't it?

09:01.553 --> 09:02.886
Oh, honey.

09:09.180 --> 09:12.339
_

09:12.647 --> 09:14.982
I need to speak
to someone about Joe Carroll.

09:15.049 --> 09:17.901
Fill this out, take a seat
with the others.

09:22.357 --> 09:24.057
He then studied in the States,

09:24.108 --> 09:25.659
where he married and became
a professor of literature

09:25.726 --> 09:26.994
at Winslow University.

09:27.061 --> 09:28.228
Also, budding novelist.

09:28.279 --> 09:30.730
In 2003, Carroll's first and only novel

09:30.782 --> 09:31.949
"The Gothic Sea" was published.

09:32.033 --> 09:34.084
It would go on
to become a best-seller,

09:34.168 --> 09:35.168
but in its initial printing,

09:35.236 --> 09:38.322
it was a commercial and critical flop.

09:38.389 --> 09:40.073
This triggered his piquerism,

09:40.124 --> 09:42.709
the act of stabbing,
slicing flesh for arousal.

09:42.760 --> 09:45.078
That's not accurate.

09:45.129 --> 09:47.347
I'm sorry. Would you
like to say something, sir?

09:49.934 --> 09:51.084
By all means, if I've got it wrong,

09:51.135 --> 09:53.687
please correct me.

09:53.754 --> 09:55.138
Ryan Hardy.

10:00.561 --> 10:03.430
Joe Carroll was obsessed
with the Romantic period.

10:03.481 --> 10:07.951
His lectures consisted
of Thoreau, Emerson,

10:08.036 --> 10:10.437
in particular his hero Edgar Allan Poe,

10:10.488 --> 10:11.822
and like Poe, he believed

10:11.906 --> 10:13.373
in the insanity of art,

10:13.441 --> 10:17.110
that it had to be... felt.

10:17.161 --> 10:20.380
He didn't just eviscerate
14 female students.

10:22.300 --> 10:23.950
He was making art.

10:24.002 --> 10:25.836
He cut out his victims' eyes as a nod

10:25.920 --> 10:28.088
to his favorite works of Poe,
"The Tell-Tale Heart"

10:28.139 --> 10:29.923
and "The Black Cat."

10:29.974 --> 10:33.560
See, Poe believed
the eyes are our identity,

10:33.627 --> 10:35.628
windows to our soul.

10:35.680 --> 10:36.796
To classify him as a piquerist

10:36.848 --> 10:40.851
would be... too simplistic.

10:45.323 --> 10:47.441
Okay, guys.
Thanks.

10:51.913 --> 10:53.447
Mike Weston.

10:53.498 --> 10:54.865
It's a real honor, sir.

10:54.949 --> 10:56.917
Did my thesis on Joe
Carroll at the academy.

10:56.984 --> 10:59.369
Your book was--
it was invaluable.

10:59.454 --> 11:00.587
It's a real thrill for me, sir.

11:00.654 --> 11:01.821
Hardy.

11:04.658 --> 11:07.427
Wow! That was pathetic.

11:07.495 --> 11:08.462
Man is a hero.

11:08.513 --> 11:09.662
Took down Carroll
single-handed.

11:09.714 --> 11:11.498
And the Bureau still let him go.

11:11.549 --> 11:12.966
You haven't read his book, have you?

11:13.017 --> 11:14.351
He's on disability.

11:14.435 --> 11:16.103
Turner said he lost it, went crazy.

11:16.170 --> 11:18.021
No. Carroll stabbed
him in the chest,

11:18.106 --> 11:19.172
punctured his left ventricular.

11:19.223 --> 11:20.474
He can't be in the field anymore.

11:20.525 --> 11:22.776
He's got a pacemaker
keeping it all pumping.

11:28.349 --> 11:30.400
Who are the women?

11:30.485 --> 11:31.818
Carroll's groupies.

11:31.869 --> 11:34.621
We're interviewing anyone who
visited Carroll in prison.

11:34.688 --> 11:36.289
Carroll had 112
visitors in the last two years,

11:36.357 --> 11:38.191
43 in the last 6 months.

11:38.242 --> 11:40.293
14 visited over 4 times.

11:40.361 --> 11:42.028
Who had the most access to him?

11:42.080 --> 11:43.246
Was he confined to his cell,

11:43.331 --> 11:44.748
did he have any privileges?

11:44.832 --> 11:46.216
Most of his time was spent
preparing for his third appeal.

11:46.300 --> 11:48.969
He'd foregone legal aid
and was representing himself.

11:49.036 --> 11:50.087
His records.

11:50.171 --> 11:52.005
So he had access to a legal library?

11:52.056 --> 11:53.757
Yeah. Every Tuesday, Carroll
was shackled and transported

11:53.841 --> 11:55.208
to the Sussex County law library,

11:55.259 --> 11:57.377
where he was confined to a
sealed room, one guard.

11:57.428 --> 11:58.545
And furnished with law books.

11:58.596 --> 12:00.430
Actual books or digital files?

12:00.515 --> 12:01.765
Digital.
Everything's archived

12:01.849 --> 12:03.767
on the library's server.

12:03.851 --> 12:05.102
So he had internet access.

12:05.186 --> 12:06.386
It would have been restricted.

12:06.437 --> 12:08.555
Because that would stop Joe Carroll?

12:10.224 --> 12:11.575
Damn it! We need to rip apart
the library's ethernet!

12:11.642 --> 12:12.859
Get the cyber techs in here.

12:43.641 --> 12:45.592
Weapon!
She's got a weapon!

12:45.643 --> 12:46.810
Stand back!

12:46.894 --> 12:48.645
Take it easy, ma'am,
easy, easy, easy, easy.

12:48.729 --> 12:49.646
Easy, easy.

12:49.730 --> 12:50.981
Drop the weapon!

12:51.065 --> 12:53.817
Drop the weapon!
Drop it!

12:53.901 --> 12:55.235
Ma'am, ma'am, look at me, look at me,

12:55.286 --> 12:56.603
look at me.

12:56.654 --> 12:59.739
You don't want to do this, okay?

12:59.791 --> 13:03.827
Just... just hand
that thing to me,

13:03.911 --> 13:05.778
and everything's gonna be okay.

13:05.830 --> 13:08.114
Lord, help my poor soul.

13:08.166 --> 13:09.115
No.

13:09.167 --> 13:11.784
Lord... help
my poor soul.

13:11.803 --> 13:13.453
No, no.

13:23.163 --> 13:24.580
She's right-handed.

13:24.647 --> 13:26.498
She did most of the upper
left region herself,

13:26.583 --> 13:29.151
but this is someone else.

13:29.202 --> 13:30.953
Carroll possibly.

13:31.004 --> 13:33.289
We're running analysis for a match.

13:33.340 --> 13:34.873
Thank you.

13:37.510 --> 13:39.511
"Once upon
a midnight dreary."

13:39.596 --> 13:40.996
"The Raven."

13:49.189 --> 13:51.440
"This fever called living
is conquered at last."

13:51.507 --> 13:52.808
It's all Poe.

13:52.859 --> 13:53.892
And what she said
at the end--

13:53.977 --> 13:55.361
Yeah. Poe's
last words.

13:55.445 --> 13:56.845
When found delirious
on the streets of Baltimore,

13:56.896 --> 14:00.232
he's believed to have uttered,
"Lord, help my poor soul."

14:03.486 --> 14:05.070
Is that water, sir?

14:05.155 --> 14:07.323
Yes.

14:07.374 --> 14:09.325
Mint?

14:09.376 --> 14:10.876
Sure.

14:13.463 --> 14:14.913
We've run her prints.

14:14.998 --> 14:16.966
So far, we've found 7 identities.

14:17.033 --> 14:18.384
4 of them are wanted in 3 states,

14:18.468 --> 14:20.719
and 2 of them visited Carroll
repeatedly in the last 6 months.

14:20.804 --> 14:21.887
Anything on the cell phone?

14:21.972 --> 14:23.055
Disposable.

14:23.139 --> 14:24.840
The text said,
"Do it now."

14:24.891 --> 14:26.008
Carroll could easily convince

14:26.059 --> 14:27.209
an unbalanced brain to do this.

14:27.260 --> 14:29.211
It's an exertion of power, theatrics.

14:32.349 --> 14:36.402
I have Sarah Fuller for you.

14:36.486 --> 14:38.070
Hello?

14:38.154 --> 14:42.574
Mr. Hardy, it's been
a long time.

14:42.659 --> 14:46.195
Sarah, hi.
How you doing?

14:46.246 --> 14:48.197
Well, not great.

14:50.566 --> 14:53.118
Listen. We're gonna
find him.

14:53.203 --> 14:59.091
Nothing is gonna happen to you,
I promise you that.

14:59.175 --> 15:01.260
I really appreciate you calling.

15:01.344 --> 15:08.801
I'm just, um, happy
to hear you're safe.

15:08.885 --> 15:10.269
Bye-bye now.

15:10.353 --> 15:12.021
Good-bye, Mr. Hardy.

15:23.533 --> 15:25.617
Thank you.

15:25.702 --> 15:27.152
They questioned Claire Matthews.

15:27.237 --> 15:30.289
She won't speak to anyone but you.
Why is that?

15:30.373 --> 15:32.441
When I speak to her, I'll ask her.

15:35.611 --> 15:37.079
Thanks.

15:37.130 --> 15:38.914
I really don't think
you got enough food, babe.

15:38.965 --> 15:40.966
Do we really have to feed the cops?

15:41.051 --> 15:42.617
I mean, can't they just order pizza?

15:42.669 --> 15:44.920
There's plenty of food.

15:44.971 --> 15:46.638
Thank you, Billy.

15:48.425 --> 15:49.391
So how's she doing?

15:49.459 --> 15:52.461
She's right here.
She's fine.

15:52.512 --> 15:54.513
Well, then why are we
ignoring that hot cop candy

15:54.597 --> 15:56.682
in the corner over there?

15:56.766 --> 15:57.900
Is he single or what?

15:57.967 --> 16:00.436
He's not
wearing a ring. I checked.

16:00.487 --> 16:01.520
...beloved
by his students,

16:01.604 --> 16:03.939
and with his charm and good looks,

16:03.990 --> 16:06.325
he was understandably a favorite

16:06.409 --> 16:08.694
amongst the female contingent.

16:08.778 --> 16:13.482
So Poe's chief principle,
insanity as art.

16:13.533 --> 16:14.867
This is the Romantic period.

16:14.951 --> 16:19.338
Death is about theme, mood,
motif, emotional aesthetic.

16:19.422 --> 16:21.590
Poe equates death with what?

16:21.657 --> 16:23.342
He equates death with love?

16:23.426 --> 16:26.378
No, not love.
Poe equates death with...

16:26.463 --> 16:30.466
Beauty.
Poe believed that art was about beauty

16:30.517 --> 16:32.167
and that nothing was more beautiful

16:32.218 --> 16:34.136
than the death
of a beautiful woman--

16:34.187 --> 16:37.022
"Helen," "Lenore,"
"Annabel Lee."

16:37.107 --> 16:39.975
And to bereave beauty is...

16:40.026 --> 16:42.861
To elevate one's soul.

16:47.984 --> 16:49.902
Carroll never
visited same web address twice,

16:49.986 --> 16:51.686
which suggests he's using various URLs.

16:51.738 --> 16:53.288
Who with?

16:53.356 --> 16:55.240
Well, there's the rub. Every time
I access an IP address, it mutates.

16:55.325 --> 16:56.858
This is a fairly sophisticated virus.

16:56.910 --> 16:58.861
Where were the guards when he was
sitting there chatting online?

16:58.928 --> 17:00.129
Who are these idiots?

17:00.196 --> 17:03.248
The detail changed,
but there's one recurring name.

17:03.333 --> 17:04.366
Jordan Raines.

17:04.416 --> 17:06.801
- Jordan "Jordy" Raines.
- I got it.

17:06.869 --> 17:09.387
32, 4-year employee,
death row,

17:09.472 --> 17:10.722
works the night shift.

17:10.807 --> 17:12.057
Was he working last night?

17:12.142 --> 17:13.342
Uh...

17:13.393 --> 17:14.726
Called in sick.

17:14.810 --> 17:15.928
- That's him.
- Prison guard.

17:16.012 --> 17:17.045
He helped Carroll escape.

17:17.096 --> 17:18.096
Get his home address.

17:18.181 --> 17:19.431
Yeah. I got it.

17:21.178 --> 17:23.124
_

17:34.280 --> 17:36.898
Federal agents.
Open up!

17:36.950 --> 17:38.250
Hit it.

17:40.570 --> 17:42.254
Clear the room!

17:42.338 --> 17:43.539
Room clear!

17:43.590 --> 17:44.790
All clear!

17:44.874 --> 17:46.625
He's not here.

17:57.103 --> 17:59.972
Hi. Hi. Hi.

18:00.056 --> 18:01.089
Say hi to the camera.

18:01.140 --> 18:02.191
Guys.

18:02.258 --> 18:04.977
Say hi. Say hi.

18:05.061 --> 18:06.761
Can you say hi to your friends?

18:06.813 --> 18:07.980
Yeah. Say hi.

18:08.064 --> 18:09.565
Hi.

18:09.616 --> 18:10.932
Your friends are out there.

18:10.984 --> 18:12.150
That's right, buddy.

18:12.235 --> 18:14.286
Oh, sweet pup.

18:14.370 --> 18:15.954
You're gonna want to see this.

18:16.039 --> 18:17.322
Can you smell them?

18:19.542 --> 18:21.543
Ohh!

18:31.137 --> 18:35.624
Bags. Man.

18:37.427 --> 18:39.761
What is that?

18:39.812 --> 18:42.264
It's a German shepherd, I think.

18:46.653 --> 18:50.105
He's been practicing.

18:50.156 --> 18:52.858
Carroll was teaching him
how to become a serial killer.

18:59.726 --> 19:01.527
I can handle dead people.

19:01.578 --> 19:04.864
You kill a dog, I go crazy.

19:04.915 --> 19:08.618
I got this little terrier mix.

19:08.702 --> 19:10.036
Forget it.

19:12.623 --> 19:13.456
What is that?

19:13.540 --> 19:14.707
It's Joe Carroll's novel.

19:14.758 --> 19:16.408
Oh, look.
It's inscribed.

19:16.460 --> 19:18.344
"Jordy, you're capable of greatness.

19:18.411 --> 19:20.546
You just have to believe.
Joe."

19:20.597 --> 19:22.247
So this Jordy guy, is lonely,

19:22.299 --> 19:24.433
he's unstable, vulnerable to kindness.

19:24.518 --> 19:27.386
Carroll recognizes his
potential and seduces him.

19:27.437 --> 19:30.389
He's emulating Carroll.
The animals,

19:30.440 --> 19:31.807
he removed their eyes.

19:31.892 --> 19:33.059
Well, Jordy looks to Carroll
the way Carroll looks to Poe.

19:33.110 --> 19:34.477
It's a godlike kind of worship.

19:34.561 --> 19:35.945
Is Carroll really that powerful?

19:36.029 --> 19:38.481
Well, you know, when
I first started to suspect him,

19:38.565 --> 19:39.598
all I had was instinct.

19:39.650 --> 19:41.567
I didn't have any evidence at all.

19:41.618 --> 19:45.454
I was having a hard time convincing
people of my Poe theory.

19:45.539 --> 19:47.907
In the book, that's when
you started following him.

19:47.958 --> 19:52.244
Yeah. Everywhere.
Home, work, school.

19:52.295 --> 19:53.963
I was just waiting
for him to get sloppy.

19:54.047 --> 19:56.281
That's when I first
recognized Sarah Fuller.

19:56.333 --> 19:57.800
I'd seen her in his class.

19:57.884 --> 20:00.002
I used to sit there
and watch him teach.

20:00.087 --> 20:03.172
You know, he was amazing.

20:03.256 --> 20:07.560
He could inspire people.
It's a gift.

20:07.627 --> 20:10.129
Hardy, let's go.

20:10.180 --> 20:11.463
Where to?

20:11.515 --> 20:13.465
It's time you talked
to Claire Matthews.

20:13.517 --> 20:14.850
No official word at this time,

20:14.935 --> 20:18.070
but sources have confirmed to us
that woman is dead today

20:18.138 --> 20:19.655
by her own hands.

20:19.740 --> 20:22.358
Now the FBI is speculating
the victim may have been

20:22.442 --> 20:24.076
one of Joe Carroll's groupies...

20:24.144 --> 20:25.244
Enough of that.

20:25.311 --> 20:26.979
As a direct mess--

20:27.030 --> 20:29.248
I say we watch a movie.

20:29.315 --> 20:31.367
Actually, I think I'm just
gonna lie day for a little bit

20:31.451 --> 20:32.618
if it's ok with you guys.

20:32.669 --> 20:33.619
Yeah.

20:33.670 --> 20:35.004
That's even a better idea.

20:35.088 --> 20:36.622
You should get some rest.

20:40.043 --> 20:42.044
We're right next door, okay?

20:42.129 --> 20:44.096
You call us if you
need anything, all right?

20:44.164 --> 20:45.181
We'll come running.

20:45.265 --> 20:46.665
I love you guys.

20:46.717 --> 20:47.833
- Love you. Good night.
- All right.

20:47.884 --> 20:49.218
Let's go.

21:17.080 --> 21:18.247
You want me to have manners?

21:18.331 --> 21:19.215
That was creepy.

21:19.299 --> 21:21.133
Whole night's been creepy.

21:21.201 --> 21:22.418
Yeah.

21:24.370 --> 21:25.921
It's so quiet.

21:26.006 --> 21:28.591
Because everyone's
in Daytona having fun,

21:28.675 --> 21:30.509
everyone but us.

21:35.315 --> 21:37.149
The hangover has begun.

21:37.217 --> 21:38.567
Told you not to drink.

21:38.652 --> 21:43.388
I'm not interesting enough
to not drink. That's--

21:43.440 --> 21:44.690
You okay?

21:49.395 --> 21:50.830
Annie?

22:02.742 --> 22:04.376
Annie?

22:12.936 --> 22:14.436
Aah!

22:15.972 --> 22:18.757
No!

22:22.929 --> 22:24.263
Sorry.

22:24.314 --> 22:25.981
Just to let you know,
there's two officers

22:26.066 --> 22:29.118
outside the door if you need them.

22:29.202 --> 22:30.986
Sure. Thank you.

22:40.113 --> 22:41.964
Claire will be right down.

22:42.048 --> 22:44.083
Hey, Joey.

22:44.134 --> 22:45.417
Do I know you?

22:45.468 --> 22:47.786
Yeah, but I haven't seen you
since you were this big.

22:47.838 --> 22:50.589
Ha ha ha!

22:50.640 --> 22:52.341
Let's let the man do his job.

23:00.650 --> 23:02.735
Professor Matthews.

23:02.802 --> 23:05.187
- Yes?
- Hi.

23:05.272 --> 23:08.640
I'm Agent Ryan Hardy, FBI.

23:08.692 --> 23:10.659
Can I speak with you?

23:10.744 --> 23:12.278
Sure.

23:12.329 --> 23:13.913
I didn't know about the eyes.

23:13.980 --> 23:16.365
It was withheld.

23:16.449 --> 23:18.817
Try Edgar Allan Poe.

23:18.869 --> 23:20.286
Um, "The Tell-Tale Heart,"

23:20.337 --> 23:23.038
"The Black Cat" both have
strong eye allegories.

23:23.123 --> 23:24.757
The eyes are symbolic,

23:24.824 --> 23:27.426
the essence of identity.

23:27.493 --> 23:28.827
You should talk to my husband.

23:28.879 --> 23:30.846
He knows a lot about that time period.

23:30.931 --> 23:32.298
You're married.

23:32.349 --> 23:36.135
Yeah. Yes, I'm married,
Agent Hardy. Why?

23:36.186 --> 23:37.686
Are we flirting?

23:41.174 --> 23:43.392
With this material, no, not a chance.

23:50.817 --> 23:52.618
Hello, Ryan.

23:52.685 --> 23:53.736
Claire.

23:53.820 --> 23:54.987
I'm Agent Mason, Miss Matthews.

23:55.038 --> 23:57.022
I understand you wanted
to speak to Mr. Hardy.

23:57.073 --> 23:59.458
Yes, but I need to
speak with him alone, please.

23:59.525 --> 24:01.493
I'm afraid that's not possible.

24:01.544 --> 24:03.829
I'm afraid I have to insist.

24:08.701 --> 24:10.502
Would you excuse us for a minute?

24:14.391 --> 24:16.541
How's your heart?

24:16.593 --> 24:18.761
Same.

24:18.845 --> 24:21.063
But you're drinking too much.

24:24.267 --> 24:26.018
Have you heard from him?

24:26.069 --> 24:28.320
Yeah. A week ago,
this came for me.

24:28.388 --> 24:30.105
I thought you should see it.

24:35.278 --> 24:37.746
How does he know?

24:37.831 --> 24:40.082
He doesn't.
He's guessing.

24:40.166 --> 24:41.233
No one needs to know about this.

24:41.284 --> 24:43.035
It's not gonna help us find him.

24:44.671 --> 24:47.406
We have two killers out there now.

24:47.457 --> 24:48.924
He's got help.

24:55.015 --> 24:56.765
Are you a cop?

25:00.586 --> 25:02.304
Joe's always teaching.

25:02.389 --> 25:04.023
It was ingrained in him,
so that makes sense.

25:04.090 --> 25:05.474
It makes sense he would find a student.

25:05.558 --> 25:07.309
Where do you think they would go?

25:07.394 --> 25:08.427
Would he leave the country?

25:08.478 --> 25:10.762
No. Joe's not looking
for his freedom.

25:10.814 --> 25:11.697
He wants to keep killing.

25:11.764 --> 25:14.766
Yeah. He's good at it.

25:14.818 --> 25:16.768
I need to find him, Claire,

25:16.820 --> 25:19.405
and I don't think I know how.

25:27.297 --> 25:31.450
I'm sorry I didn't call you.

25:31.501 --> 25:32.668
It's been 8 years, Ryan.

25:32.752 --> 25:35.554
I got the hint.

25:35.621 --> 25:37.056
I mean, I know--
I know that

25:37.123 --> 25:38.507
when the FBI found out about us

25:38.591 --> 25:39.925
that was difficult for you.

25:39.976 --> 25:44.646
No. That's not why
I didn't call.

25:44.731 --> 25:46.648
You deserve more.

25:46.733 --> 25:48.967
I belong in your past.

25:49.019 --> 25:51.904
I work better in people's pasts,
I always have.

26:01.114 --> 26:04.816
Uh, the girl safe?
The last victim, she's--

26:04.868 --> 26:09.505
Sarah Fuller.
Uh, yeah, she's under protection.

26:09.589 --> 26:11.423
She's good.
She's a doctor now.

26:11.491 --> 26:15.044
I'm glad someone was
able to get beyond this.

26:15.128 --> 26:17.596
I'm sure that upsets Joe.

26:17.663 --> 26:18.830
Why's that?

26:18.882 --> 26:20.132
He fancies himself Edgar Allan Poe.

26:20.183 --> 26:22.384
That was the impetus
for writing his novel.

26:22.469 --> 26:23.969
Poe died with an unfinished manuscript,

26:24.020 --> 26:25.670
"The Lighthouse,"

26:25.722 --> 26:27.473
and Joe's novel "The Gothic Sea"

26:27.524 --> 26:30.342
was sort of his way
of finishing what Poe started.

26:32.845 --> 26:33.979
What was that about in there?

26:34.030 --> 26:35.064
It was personal.

26:35.148 --> 26:36.315
What do you mean personal?

26:36.366 --> 26:37.449
We have to get to Sarah Fuller.

26:37.517 --> 26:38.534
What did she tell you?

26:38.618 --> 26:39.651
Carroll is gonna make a move.

26:39.702 --> 26:41.019
He wants to finish what he started.

26:41.071 --> 26:42.571
That would be Sarah.

26:52.916 --> 26:54.366
It's right this way.

26:56.586 --> 26:58.253
I'm Detective Warren.

26:58.338 --> 26:59.972
Miss Fuller went to bed
about an hour ago.

27:00.039 --> 27:04.059
Officer Pontz works the front door.

27:04.144 --> 27:06.061
Another officer here.

27:06.146 --> 27:07.729
Two men upstairs.

27:07.814 --> 27:09.098
Officers!

27:09.182 --> 27:10.315
Where are they?

27:10.383 --> 27:12.518
Officer Watts.

27:12.569 --> 27:14.353
Kelly, where are you guys?

27:14.404 --> 27:16.221
They should be here.

27:18.024 --> 27:19.391
Sarah?

27:21.161 --> 27:22.778
She's gone.
Where is she?

27:22.862 --> 27:24.029
- Where the hell is she?
- I don't know!

27:24.080 --> 27:25.614
How did she get out of here?

27:25.698 --> 27:27.199
We got an officer down.
We got an officer down.

27:46.586 --> 27:47.769
Go around.

27:47.854 --> 27:49.588
Come on.
Neighbors next door. Let's go.

27:53.926 --> 27:55.394
Give me a light.

29:32.709 --> 29:36.128
Get the lights.
Get the lights!

29:41.718 --> 29:43.218
Hardy.

29:50.445 --> 29:52.486
_

29:59.915 --> 30:01.065
So the neighbors
Will Wilson and Billy Thomas

30:01.116 --> 30:03.084
left in their SUV 40 minutes ago.

30:03.168 --> 30:04.786
No one thought to search the vehicle?

30:04.870 --> 30:05.920
There was no reason to check.

30:06.004 --> 30:07.338
She wasn't missing.

30:07.405 --> 30:09.257
Will Wilson teaches
public school, second grade.

30:09.341 --> 30:10.958
Billy Thomas as is a computer tech.

30:11.043 --> 30:13.077
He runs the fraud division
of a regional bank.

30:13.128 --> 30:14.962
And I bet they weren't gay either.

30:15.047 --> 30:17.465
Carroll placed them
here to watch over her

30:17.549 --> 30:18.850
until he was ready.

30:18.917 --> 30:20.584
Come on. They've been her
neighbors for 3 years.

30:20.636 --> 30:21.969
She'd never suspect them,

30:22.054 --> 30:25.439
and now they're taking
her straight to Carroll.

30:25.524 --> 30:28.643
He's finding people to help him
do it on the damn internet.

30:28.727 --> 30:30.862
It-- it's like they're
his followers.

30:30.929 --> 30:33.114
I'm not buying two
men would pretend to be gay

30:33.198 --> 30:34.532
and shack up next to a woman

30:34.599 --> 30:35.933
because some nut job told them to.

30:35.984 --> 30:38.152
Prison guard worships him,

30:38.237 --> 30:41.272
ice pick lady is
brainwashed to kill herself.

30:41.323 --> 30:45.042
These two guys have
dedicated years of their lives to him.

30:45.110 --> 30:47.378
There's some kind of fanatical
obsession at play here.

30:47.445 --> 30:49.947
It's like it's
a cult. It's--

30:52.718 --> 30:55.253
"Nevermore." "The Raven."

30:55.304 --> 30:59.006
Poe is symbolizing
the finality of death.

30:59.091 --> 31:01.425
Have you pulled the GPS?
Where are the satellites?

31:01.476 --> 31:03.010
I knew you'd show up eventually.

31:03.095 --> 31:04.345
- Do something!
- This is the Hardy I remember.

31:04.429 --> 31:05.563
How many checkpoints have you set up?

31:05.630 --> 31:06.681
- Get him out of here!
- Don't just stand there!

31:06.765 --> 31:10.351
- Move!
- Hardy!

31:35.427 --> 31:36.878
Back off, dude.

31:36.962 --> 31:37.879
Sorry, sorry.

31:37.963 --> 31:39.830
Come on, Sarah.

31:39.882 --> 31:42.350
- God.
- You don't have to be rude.

31:42.434 --> 31:44.501
- Sorry, sir.
- Come on.

31:44.553 --> 31:46.220
God.

31:46.305 --> 31:47.605
There's a killer on the loose,

31:47.672 --> 31:49.340
and you want me to have manners?

31:49.391 --> 31:50.474
That was creepy.

31:50.525 --> 31:52.343
The whole night's been creepy.

31:52.394 --> 31:54.345
Yeah.

32:21.390 --> 32:22.890
Behind you.

32:22.975 --> 32:24.475
Ugh!

32:31.316 --> 32:33.017
Unh!

33:11.640 --> 33:12.923
Hey. What do you got?

33:12.975 --> 33:15.476
Well, both men were
listed in the prison's visitor log.

33:15.560 --> 33:17.094
You got a file on these guys.

33:17.145 --> 33:20.114
Nothing except some property
records in Lake Whitehurst.

34:00.671 --> 34:04.639
_

35:24.272 --> 35:26.157
I came alone, Joe!

35:26.224 --> 35:28.275
Isn't that what you wanted?

35:31.997 --> 35:34.582
No! No!

35:34.666 --> 35:39.736
No! No! No!

35:39.788 --> 35:42.256
No!

35:46.878 --> 35:52.967
No! No! No! No!

36:17.442 --> 36:18.942
Unh!

36:21.796 --> 36:23.280
Hello, Ryan.

36:30.839 --> 36:33.674
I was curious to see how
your heart was holding up.

36:35.143 --> 36:37.261
Unh!

36:37.312 --> 36:38.962
I see it has its limits.

36:46.404 --> 36:47.821
Where is she?

36:47.906 --> 36:50.974
You know, the human eye is connected

36:51.026 --> 36:52.993
by 7 muscles.

36:55.313 --> 36:59.583
I removed each one individually.

37:02.037 --> 37:03.987
You know how hard that is to do?

37:04.039 --> 37:05.456
No! No!

37:05.507 --> 37:06.840
Sarah?

37:06.925 --> 37:07.841
No--

37:10.495 --> 37:13.597
No! No!

37:13.665 --> 37:16.967
You know how I love
my little souvenirs.

37:17.018 --> 37:18.001
No!

37:24.175 --> 37:27.778
Aah! Ohh!

37:30.615 --> 37:31.782
No!

37:31.849 --> 37:35.319
She lasted much longer than
I thought she would.

37:35.370 --> 37:36.853
She's quite the fighter.

37:40.375 --> 37:42.042
I'd like to turn myself in.

37:43.211 --> 37:46.363
I surrender.

37:46.414 --> 37:48.882
I surrender!

37:48.967 --> 37:50.167
Stop!

37:50.218 --> 37:51.885
Hardy!

37:51.970 --> 37:54.204
I surrender.

37:54.256 --> 37:55.589
Come on. Get off.
Off him, off him. Get off him.

37:55.674 --> 37:57.207
I surrender.

37:59.477 --> 38:00.894
No!

38:00.979 --> 38:02.429
I surrender.

38:19.144 --> 38:22.012
Carroll's en route to Richmond.

38:22.063 --> 38:23.513
He'll be placed in federal detention

38:23.565 --> 38:25.399
until this is all over.

38:27.652 --> 38:30.520
18 months I worked the case,

38:30.572 --> 38:32.389
couldn't crack it.

38:37.378 --> 38:39.863
I made so many mistakes.

38:43.034 --> 38:44.334
But Sarah...

38:47.088 --> 38:48.672
I saved her.

38:51.559 --> 38:53.644
How'd you know he'd be here?

38:53.711 --> 38:55.979
Carroll's book was inspired by Poe's

38:56.047 --> 38:59.066
last unfinished work
"The Lighthouse."

38:59.150 --> 39:03.353
Sarah was his unfinished work.

39:03.404 --> 39:04.605
Yeah.

39:06.441 --> 39:08.558
He wanted to get the ending right.

39:13.031 --> 39:16.269
_

39:20.505 --> 39:22.923
Joe Carroll had 47 dedicated web sites,

39:23.007 --> 39:25.976
over a thousand blogs,
chat rooms, online forums.

39:26.027 --> 39:27.110
Could have multiple resources.

39:27.162 --> 39:29.947
Hardy.

39:29.998 --> 39:31.949
He'll only talk to you.

39:57.692 --> 40:01.177
Sarah had to die, Ryan.

40:01.229 --> 40:04.898
I know it's sad.
It's tragic.

40:04.983 --> 40:06.650
Poor thing.

40:06.701 --> 40:10.854
She worked very hard
to get her life back together,

40:10.905 --> 40:12.239
and she'd done quite nicely,

40:12.323 --> 40:15.993
which is more than I can say for some.

40:16.044 --> 40:20.214
Oh, you've been quite
the disappointment, Ryan.

40:20.298 --> 40:24.534
Now I never expected you
capable of "in cold blood,"

40:24.586 --> 40:27.638
but what was it
with the true crime drivel?

40:27.705 --> 40:29.973
So what's my sequel about Joe?

40:30.041 --> 40:32.976
Everyone outside is anxious to know.

40:33.044 --> 40:35.879
Hmm. Well...

40:35.930 --> 40:39.716
it's going to be a collaboration.

40:39.767 --> 40:42.552
We're gonna write this together, Ryan.

40:42.604 --> 40:47.274
My first book was
clearly too avant garde,

40:47.358 --> 40:51.028
lost in literati pretense.

40:51.079 --> 40:53.614
Now my new story...

40:53.698 --> 40:57.117
will play to a much wider audience.

40:57.201 --> 41:02.372
Hell, even Poe whored
himself out eventually.

41:04.042 --> 41:06.843
So the prison guard,

41:06.911 --> 41:08.679
the gay neighbors,

41:08.746 --> 41:11.682
how do they figure into your new plot?

41:14.135 --> 41:15.352
We know about the cult.

41:15.419 --> 41:18.055
I'm not a big fan of that word.

41:18.106 --> 41:21.058
I like to think of them as my friends.

41:21.109 --> 41:25.729
It's important to have friends, Ryan.

41:25.780 --> 41:28.598
Did you know that the FBI estimates

41:28.650 --> 41:30.734
that up to 300 serial killers

41:30.785 --> 41:34.371
are active in the US on any given day?

41:38.376 --> 41:39.459
Oh!

41:39.544 --> 41:41.211
Sorry. Didn't mean
to scare you.

41:41.278 --> 41:42.796
Is everything ok?

41:42.880 --> 41:44.331
Extra patrol this evening.

41:44.415 --> 41:45.549
I thought they caught him.

41:45.616 --> 41:46.667
I saw it on the news.

41:46.751 --> 41:47.801
Still, mind if I look around,

41:47.885 --> 41:49.953
check your doors and windows?

41:50.004 --> 41:53.807
Do you have any friends, Ryan?

41:55.977 --> 41:57.311
Come on in.

41:57.395 --> 41:59.295
I think everyone's asleep.

42:04.152 --> 42:09.272
I will be your friend

42:09.324 --> 42:12.659
even though you slept with my wife.

42:12.744 --> 42:14.111
There is breaking news tonight

42:14.178 --> 42:15.746
from Waverly, Virginia,

42:15.813 --> 42:19.266
where serial killer Joe Carroll
has finally been caught.

42:19.334 --> 42:21.796
The escaped convict was found
at an abandoned--

42:23.705 --> 42:27.824
Did she show you the letter?

42:27.875 --> 42:29.760
What's he talking about?
What letter?

42:29.827 --> 42:32.646
Claire is very important, Ryan.

42:32.730 --> 42:35.399
Every good story needs a love interest.

42:35.450 --> 42:36.566
I'm going to bed.

42:36.617 --> 42:38.224
- Good night.
- Good night.

42:40.538 --> 42:44.491
She's the only woman
I've ever truly loved.

42:44.575 --> 42:46.076
She's the mother of my son.

42:46.127 --> 42:48.128
Joey?

42:50.448 --> 42:51.748
And I'd like to see her.

42:51.799 --> 42:54.284
No. She'd never
agree to that.

42:54.335 --> 42:57.287
She might just change
her mind about that.

42:57.338 --> 42:58.555
Joey?

42:58.622 --> 43:00.557
Joey?!

43:00.624 --> 43:02.008
Where is he? Joey?

43:02.093 --> 43:03.960
I thought I might go
more traditional this time,

43:04.011 --> 43:06.012
you know, villain, good versus evil.

43:06.097 --> 43:07.647
I need a strong protagonist

43:07.732 --> 43:11.184
so that the reader can truly invest,

43:11.269 --> 43:16.306
a flawed, broken man
searching for redemption,

43:16.357 --> 43:18.992
and that is you.

43:19.077 --> 43:22.496
You are my flawed hero.

43:22.580 --> 43:26.032
Yes, I ensured that by killing Sarah.

43:27.668 --> 43:29.186
She was the inciting incident,

43:29.237 --> 43:31.488
the hero's call to action.

43:31.555 --> 43:32.656
This is merely the prologue,

43:32.723 --> 43:34.324
this is just the beginning.

43:34.391 --> 43:40.530
That was the entire point
of Sarah's death.

43:40.581 --> 43:42.449
It was for you.

43:42.533 --> 43:45.502
♪ Everybody's looking for something ♪

43:45.569 --> 43:47.754
♪ some of them want... ♪

43:47.839 --> 43:51.091
If this book ends with anything
other than your death,

43:51.175 --> 43:54.961
you better plan on a rewrite.

43:55.046 --> 43:57.764
Aah! Oh! Guards! Guards!

43:57.849 --> 43:59.582
Joey, honey, where are you?

43:59.634 --> 44:00.934
Where's Denise?

44:01.018 --> 44:04.104
Denise? Where is--
where is Denise?

44:04.188 --> 44:06.422
Guards!
Ohh! Unh!

44:06.474 --> 44:07.724
That's enough!

44:07.775 --> 44:10.560
Where's my son? Joey!

44:10.611 --> 44:12.779
Joey, where are you?

44:12.864 --> 44:15.098
Call Claire.

44:15.149 --> 44:16.833
It's just the beginning.

44:19.870 --> 44:23.223
It will be a classic.

44:23.307 --> 44:25.725
It will be our masterpiece.

44:25.810 --> 44:28.011
Call Claire.

44:28.062 --> 44:29.846
Call Claire!
