00:04.059 --> 00:07.900
You're awake and it's time
this ship set sail.

00:09.900 --> 00:11.179
What?

00:11.180 --> 00:12.619
Nothing.

00:12.620 --> 00:14.539
You don't need to avoid me.

00:14.540 --> 00:16.379
Why would I be avoiding you?

00:16.379 --> 00:17.780
Because you don't want
to talk about her.

00:17.781 --> 00:19.299
That's not it.

00:19.300 --> 00:21.339
Get off me! Put me down!

00:21.340 --> 00:22.780
Mates, then?

00:24.820 --> 00:25.899
Whoa! Hang on.

00:25.900 --> 00:30.180
If you tell a soul,
I'll fucking kill you, all right?

01:13.940 --> 01:15.179
Oh, fuck!

01:15.180 --> 01:16.460
Oh, fuck!

01:21.580 --> 01:24.180
Mini, I love you.

01:26.540 --> 01:28.339
Oh, shit!

01:28.340 --> 01:30.939
No, no, no, no, Mins.
Mins, no, wait.

01:30.940 --> 01:33.219
I meant, I meant... Fuck!

01:33.220 --> 01:35.259
Jesus, farmboy.
Talk about ruining the mood.

01:35.260 --> 01:37.019
Look, I think I do, though.

01:37.020 --> 01:37.940
I think I fucking love you.

01:37.941 --> 01:40.259
You love fucking me. It's different.

01:40.260 --> 01:42.379
No, Mini, stop. Mini.

01:42.380 --> 01:45.659
Mins? You in here, slut-bag?

01:45.660 --> 01:48.540
Mins! I need some money.
I know you're in here!

01:50.060 --> 01:53.139
Er, I'm just having a piss.
Give me one fucking second, OK?

01:53.140 --> 01:55.299
Let me in! I need one, too.

01:55.300 --> 01:56.260
Shut the fuck up!

01:56.261 --> 01:58.060
What the fuck, Mini?

02:00.380 --> 02:03.660
If you're doing a shit,
I've lost all respect for you.

02:07.860 --> 02:11.339
Have you been, like, fucking
someone in here or something?

02:11.340 --> 02:13.739
What? Like who, Sherlock?

02:13.740 --> 02:14.899
Shhh.

02:14.900 --> 02:16.020
Come on, lets go and dance.

02:16.021 --> 02:18.259
Wait, Mini. I need a slash!

02:18.260 --> 02:20.859
OK, I'm so sorry.

02:20.860 --> 02:23.059
All right?

02:23.060 --> 02:25.379
Calm, yeah?

02:25.380 --> 02:27.539
OK, you've just got
a little bit of some...

02:27.540 --> 02:29.420
Oh, fuck!

03:26.940 --> 03:28.579
You don't mind, do you, love?

03:58.660 --> 04:01.819
Morning, love. Sleep well?

04:01.820 --> 04:03.380
You're in my seat.

04:07.620 --> 04:09.020
Morning, babe.

04:14.140 --> 04:15.740
This is nice.

04:18.380 --> 04:20.619
Why is he still here?

04:20.620 --> 04:24.699
Well, I was going to run something
past you, actually, sweetheart.

04:24.700 --> 04:26.899
I think Eric should,
you know, move in.

04:26.900 --> 04:28.460
He's fucking looking at my tits, Mum!

04:28.461 --> 04:29.899
No, I...

04:29.900 --> 04:31.459
He was!

04:31.460 --> 04:33.939
How can you blame him
if you'll come down

04:33.940 --> 04:34.420
with them hanging out like that?

04:34.421 --> 04:36.099
He's a pervert.

04:36.100 --> 04:38.380
You're asking me if
I want to live with a pervert.

04:38.381 --> 04:40.099
Don't be so dramatic.

04:40.100 --> 04:40.740
I'm going to go.

04:40.741 --> 04:42.419
Sit!

04:42.420 --> 04:46.459
I mean, do you enjoy making
people feel bad or something?

04:46.460 --> 04:51.259
You're telling me that I make
people feel bad? Oh, fuck this.

04:51.260 --> 04:53.259
Don't you dare ruin this for me.

04:53.260 --> 04:54.660
Whatever!

05:51.900 --> 05:54.499
It's time I thought
about myself for once.

05:54.500 --> 05:59.059
I am not going to live with
some random bloke I don't know.

05:59.060 --> 06:00.659
Don't I deserve to be happy, too?

06:00.660 --> 06:02.420
Not if it fucks me over, no.

06:03.740 --> 06:06.020
If you do this, I'll leave.

06:07.420 --> 06:09.780
He's moving in tomorrow.

06:11.220 --> 06:12.740
Just deal with it.

06:23.620 --> 06:24.740
Fuck that!

06:35.860 --> 06:37.259
Hello.

06:37.260 --> 06:40.899
Hello? Hi, Gregory?
Er, it's me, Mini.

06:40.900 --> 06:42.899
Mini? Mini who?

06:42.900 --> 06:44.500
Your daughter, Mini.

07:10.420 --> 07:11.380
Hey, Mini.

07:15.020 --> 07:17.699
Sorry I'm late.

07:17.700 --> 07:19.819
How you doing?

07:19.820 --> 07:21.060
I'm fine.

07:23.580 --> 07:27.019
We came here last time, didn't we?

07:27.020 --> 07:30.619
You were wearing red sparkly shoes.

07:30.620 --> 07:31.820
Pink.

07:33.260 --> 07:34.660
Two? Three years ago?

07:36.860 --> 07:38.659
I was 12.

07:38.660 --> 07:41.459
12? Wow.

07:41.460 --> 07:46.579
So, is everything OK, little girl?
You sounded stressed on the phone.

07:46.580 --> 07:49.899
Things at home... with Mum.

07:49.900 --> 07:54.059
She's got this new boyfriend who's
moving in, she's driving me mad.

07:54.060 --> 07:57.619
Sometimes I just feel like she
doesn't even want me there.

07:57.620 --> 08:01.299
Maybe I should speak to her?
See what's going on.

08:01.300 --> 08:04.180
Anyway, let's get out
of here, shall we?

08:06.780 --> 08:09.739
Well, I'd better get back to work,
so where should I drop you?

08:09.740 --> 08:11.180
You're back at the Bristol office?

08:11.181 --> 08:12.540
Yeah, for a while.

08:13.900 --> 08:17.419
Can I come see you there?
Tomorrow maybe?

08:17.420 --> 08:19.259
Yeah, sure, good idea.

08:19.260 --> 08:21.019
Mini!

08:21.020 --> 08:23.459
Oi, oi! Mins!

08:23.460 --> 08:23.898
For God's sake, no.

08:23.899 --> 08:25.020
Mini, Mini, Mini!

08:25.021 --> 08:27.019
Just drive!

08:27.020 --> 08:27.900
No, wait, wait, wait!

08:27.901 --> 08:29.859
Now, Gregory, drive!

08:29.860 --> 08:31.980
Wait!

08:37.059 --> 08:38.500
What are you doing here, farmboy?

08:38.501 --> 08:41.780
Didn't you see me?
Just did a complete ninja run!

08:43.740 --> 08:44.779
All right?

08:44.780 --> 08:45.780
Hi.

08:47.380 --> 08:49.899
This is my dad.

08:49.900 --> 08:52.499
Oh, bangin'!
I didn't know you had one.

08:52.500 --> 08:55.379
So, we're just,
we're just leaving so...

08:55.380 --> 08:58.259
I wanted, I wanted to talk to you.

08:58.260 --> 09:00.219
About last night.

09:00.220 --> 09:02.419
That thing I said.

09:02.420 --> 09:04.539
After the... the thing we did.

09:04.540 --> 09:07.859
I think you're confusing
your dreams with your life again.

09:07.860 --> 09:10.340
So, I'll see you around, OK?
Drive, Gregory, drive!

09:10.341 --> 09:13.459
Mini? Mini. Mins, stop!

09:13.460 --> 09:15.460
Fuck! Ow! Shit!

09:52.300 --> 09:53.579
Come in.

09:53.580 --> 09:56.059
All right, beautiful?
Come to rescue me?

09:56.060 --> 09:57.619
Am I interrupting?

09:57.620 --> 10:02.619
No, no, come in, come in.
Mini, this is Ryan, my assistant

10:02.620 --> 10:03.620
and this is Jude.

10:03.621 --> 10:05.019
Are you the intern?

10:05.020 --> 10:08.059
He always did like them young.

10:08.060 --> 10:09.180
I'm his daughter.

10:09.181 --> 10:10.500
Your daughter?

10:12.140 --> 10:13.619
So nice to meet you.

10:13.620 --> 10:15.460
You too.

10:16.860 --> 10:18.580
He's not normally
this much of a douche.

10:18.581 --> 10:21.299
Sorry, you just took me
by surprise, that's all.

10:21.300 --> 10:24.179
Er, hello? Have you
forgotten about Boudoir

10:24.180 --> 10:26.939
or shall we just stand here
and admire your progeny?

10:26.940 --> 10:30.779
Get it done, Gregory.
I'm counting on you.

10:30.780 --> 10:31.740
I'll call you later.

10:35.020 --> 10:38.019
Well, they all look
the fucking same to me!

10:38.020 --> 10:39.340
This one's cool.

10:41.700 --> 10:43.019
Well, yeah.

10:43.020 --> 10:44.259
Looks good.

10:44.260 --> 10:46.379
Done.

10:46.380 --> 10:48.699
Right, let's get out of here.

10:48.700 --> 10:51.899
I'm telling you, she's lucky we are
launching her product at all.

10:51.900 --> 10:54.260
It's like working with an overgrown
teenager with a crack habit!

10:55.340 --> 10:58.259
Do you know what I mean?
Yeah, I'll have one...

10:58.260 --> 11:01.300
All right, daydreamer?
Away with the fairies?

11:04.340 --> 11:06.099
Ah, the Gregory Show.

11:06.100 --> 11:08.419
Do all those, er, people
work for him?

11:08.420 --> 11:10.219
Pretty much.

11:10.220 --> 11:15.019
It's like the world's best looking
family or something!

11:15.020 --> 11:17.779
I hope you're including me in that.

11:17.780 --> 11:19.658
How long have you
been his assistant?

11:19.659 --> 11:20.620
Er, almost a year.

11:21.900 --> 11:24.260
I'm hoping we get this big
international contract

11:24.261 --> 11:25.940
and then maybe I can...

11:27.820 --> 11:29.419
Sorry, what?

11:29.420 --> 11:32.020
Nah, it's OK. Go chat to him.

11:36.380 --> 11:39.179
But have a drink with me sometime?

11:39.180 --> 11:41.140
When I'm not working, I mean.

11:42.460 --> 11:43.580
Maybe.

11:47.540 --> 11:48.739
Dad?

11:48.740 --> 11:51.379
You all right, love,
have you got a drink?

11:51.380 --> 11:54.180
Actually, I was just wondering,
could I get a lift home?

11:56.580 --> 12:00.420
Yeah, of course, darling, course.
Right, come on then.

12:02.540 --> 12:03.860
See you later, guys.

12:09.500 --> 12:11.579
I don't want to live
with her any more.

12:11.580 --> 12:14.699
Well, you'd be weird
if you did at your age.

12:14.700 --> 12:16.020
You don't know what she's like.

12:16.021 --> 12:17.740
Actually, I do!

12:24.260 --> 12:27.379
Well, well, well,
Shelley McGuinness!

12:27.380 --> 12:31.099
I think you might have
something of mine, Greg.

12:31.100 --> 12:33.578
We were just talking about Mini
maybe staying over at mine

12:33.579 --> 12:35.820
sometime this week,
give us a chance to hang out.

12:35.821 --> 12:38.499
Maybe make it a regular thing.

12:38.500 --> 12:39.460
Regular?

12:39.461 --> 12:42.739
Right, well, good luck
with that, Greg.

12:42.740 --> 12:44.980
Maybe you and I should meet
up for coffee sometime?

12:44.981 --> 12:46.859
Fuck off, Greg.

12:46.860 --> 12:49.260
Mini, inside, now!

12:51.420 --> 12:54.659
I'll see you when
I get back, Mini!

12:54.660 --> 12:58.619
I mean it, you're welcome anytime.
Just call me, OK?

12:58.620 --> 13:00.060
OK, thanks.

13:12.100 --> 13:13.899
Are you fucking kidding me?

13:13.900 --> 13:15.499
Eric let me in.

13:15.500 --> 13:17.100
So you just thought you'd
look through my stuff?

13:17.101 --> 13:19.420
Shit. I'm sorry.

13:21.060 --> 13:22.900
Hey.

13:24.300 --> 13:27.059
Can you turn off mega bitch
for a second, please?

13:27.060 --> 13:28.980
I want proper Mini.

13:32.620 --> 13:36.379
Well, seeing as you're here,
you might as well earn your keep.

13:36.380 --> 13:37.180
Mini, Mini, Mini, Mini, Mini!

13:37.181 --> 13:38.459
Shh.

13:38.460 --> 13:40.499
That's not why I came
round, all right?

13:40.500 --> 13:41.460
I want to talk to you.

13:50.220 --> 13:51.900
I'm sorry I freaked you out
the other night.

13:51.901 --> 13:53.699
You were fucked.

13:53.700 --> 13:55.779
I wasn't that fucked.

13:55.780 --> 13:58.939
Right, you can't just come over here

13:58.940 --> 14:02.379
and start bitching about feelings
like a little pussy.

14:02.380 --> 14:04.460
If you're not here
to fuck me, go home!

14:07.260 --> 14:07.980
I'm coming in.

14:07.981 --> 14:10.299
What? Get out, Eric, you paedo!

14:10.300 --> 14:13.019
I don't think that Alo
should be staying over,

14:13.020 --> 14:14.699
if that's what you were thinking.

14:14.700 --> 14:16.459
No offence, mate.

14:16.460 --> 14:18.219
Oh, no.

14:18.220 --> 14:20.380
Are you having a fucking
schizophrenic episode or something?

14:20.381 --> 14:21.979
I'm trying to do the right thing.

14:21.980 --> 14:25.059
You're a young girl.
Your mum wouldn't like it.

14:25.060 --> 14:29.939
He's staying over, in here, with me,
and we're going to fuck so loud

14:29.940 --> 14:34.419
that it drowns out the noise
of you fucking my mother!

14:34.420 --> 14:36.860
And your tea's ready.

14:38.460 --> 14:40.020
You're sleeping on the floor.

14:52.100 --> 14:55.140
What's the one where Liv
looks like a condom?

14:58.580 --> 15:00.499
Is Grace dressed as Cinderella?

15:00.500 --> 15:01.580
Yes!

15:03.340 --> 15:06.540
Halloween, year 10.
Liv went as a condom.

15:12.380 --> 15:16.460
And... and the one where Grace
is holding a massive crab?

15:18.580 --> 15:20.660
Newquay, summer before college.

15:24.700 --> 15:25.660
She looks happy.

15:34.620 --> 15:35.740
Mini?

15:42.020 --> 15:43.420
I miss her too.

16:59.540 --> 17:02.580
Alo. What?

17:10.339 --> 17:11.419
You should go.

17:11.420 --> 17:15.619
Let me wait till the morning
glory's gone down, yeah?

17:16.940 --> 17:18.179
Now! Get up!

17:18.180 --> 17:19.939
Mini. Alo!

17:19.940 --> 17:22.460
Fucking hell, Mini,
chill out, you mentaler!

17:42.940 --> 17:45.700
You need to stop being
a bitch to me.

17:51.540 --> 17:52.540
Oh, shut up!

18:02.940 --> 18:03.900
That bad, huh?

18:05.260 --> 18:07.060
Come in.

18:09.420 --> 18:13.580
There is no Part 17,
there's no fucking part 17!

18:14.620 --> 18:18.499
Hi! This is, like, so almost ready!

18:18.500 --> 18:19.899
Is this my bed?

18:19.900 --> 18:21.659
Yeah.

18:21.660 --> 18:26.140
Maybe we shouldn't have laughed
when they asked if we wanted to
use the installation service!

18:29.620 --> 18:31.819
Great!

18:31.820 --> 18:36.419
Are... you two going to,
er, grow a pair any time soon

18:36.420 --> 18:37.660
and get me a drink?

18:39.140 --> 18:41.300
Yeah, I'll get the drinks.

18:50.060 --> 18:53.059
It's like you've got
super powers or something!

18:53.060 --> 18:54.659
Piece of piss!

18:54.660 --> 18:56.220
OK, champagne, anyone?

18:57.820 --> 18:58.899
Thanks.

18:58.900 --> 19:04.540
To Mini, for rescuing the world
from useless men, one at a time!

19:08.020 --> 19:11.899
Right, well, I'm wiped,
I'll leave you to it.

19:11.900 --> 19:14.020
I'll need those prints ready
in the morning, Ryan,

19:14.021 --> 19:15.779
so no flirting with Mini, OK?

19:15.780 --> 19:16.740
Dad!

19:19.060 --> 19:20.020
Night-night.

19:23.780 --> 19:24.900
He's so happy you're here.

19:24.901 --> 19:26.299
Really?

19:26.300 --> 19:28.620
I haven't seen him
like this in ages.

19:44.300 --> 19:46.580
I'm going to go,
before you get me in trouble.

20:48.020 --> 20:50.380
Too late, I already saw you.

20:54.660 --> 20:56.300
You look cute.

21:00.460 --> 21:02.139
Uh, where's Dad?

21:02.140 --> 21:04.219
The office.
It's half ten, sleeping beauty.

21:04.220 --> 21:05.180
Oh.

21:06.900 --> 21:08.620
Why are you here, then?

21:09.860 --> 21:12.299
Follow me, mon cherie.

21:12.300 --> 21:14.219
What are you doing?

21:14.220 --> 21:15.460
Come on.

21:20.660 --> 21:22.179
Close your eyes.

21:22.180 --> 21:23.579
Uh, that's a bit rapey.

21:23.580 --> 21:25.379
Just do it!

21:25.380 --> 21:26.580
OK.

21:30.500 --> 21:31.580
Ryan?

21:32.780 --> 21:33.780
Ryan?

21:34.980 --> 21:37.019
What... what's going on?

21:37.020 --> 21:39.940
OK. Open your eyes.

21:41.420 --> 21:43.380
Gregory's having
a work event tonight.

21:43.381 --> 21:46.420
He told me to find you a dress.
What do you think?

21:48.100 --> 21:49.620
Yeah.

21:50.980 --> 21:54.100
Great. I've got to go.
Get dressed, you hobo.

22:44.860 --> 22:46.900
Get the fuck out of me!

22:53.340 --> 22:54.700
Mini?

22:59.060 --> 23:00.459
Move.

23:00.460 --> 23:02.100
Tell me this isn't
what I think it is.

23:02.101 --> 23:03.979
Uh, yeah, it might be, yeah.

23:03.980 --> 23:06.020
Time to lay off the weed, Franks.

23:09.860 --> 23:11.419
God.

23:11.420 --> 23:12.740
You are.

23:16.100 --> 23:17.140
Mini, wait!

23:18.300 --> 23:19.660
What are you going to do? Mini?

23:19.661 --> 23:22.220
Are you going to keep
your mouth shut or not?!

23:23.740 --> 23:24.700
Yeah.

23:27.140 --> 23:28.460
Thank you.

23:30.060 --> 23:31.540
I can't believe it.

23:42.180 --> 23:44.179
All right?

23:44.180 --> 23:45.419
Fine, fag hag.

23:45.420 --> 23:47.419
Still in that mood, then?

23:47.420 --> 23:50.739
We were going to go to Thekla
tonight. If you fancy it?

23:50.740 --> 23:53.499
Why, is it ass-raider night
or something?

23:53.500 --> 23:55.579
You know,
homophobia's not your forte.

23:55.580 --> 23:58.179
You can tell your heart's
not really in it.

23:58.180 --> 24:01.539
Actually, my dad's having
a party at the Catacombs.

24:01.540 --> 24:03.900
I'd ask you along but it's,
er, it's pretty exclusive,

24:03.901 --> 24:06.099
Your dad's still around?

24:06.100 --> 24:07.698
When did he muscle his way
back into your life?

24:07.699 --> 24:09.098
What's your problem, Liv?

24:09.099 --> 24:11.140
You can't stand anything good
to happen to anyone, can you?

24:11.141 --> 24:13.099
That's not fair.

24:13.100 --> 24:15.139
Enjoy your bum party, bum boy.

24:15.140 --> 24:16.100
Mini, wait.

24:23.420 --> 24:26.819
"What did become of my heart
When I first saw thee?

24:26.820 --> 24:29.299
"I brought a heart into the room

24:29.300 --> 24:32.140
"But from the room
I carried none with me..."

24:51.900 --> 24:54.059
Can I help you?

24:54.060 --> 24:58.260
Yeah, sorry I'm late, erm...
I'm in this class.

24:59.500 --> 25:01.539
I don't recall you being
here before.

25:01.540 --> 25:05.299
Well, I've been away for a bit.
Erm...

25:05.300 --> 25:07.619
Like, on... holiday

25:07.620 --> 25:12.020
Oh, my God, of course!
You're the boy whose... Of course!

25:15.220 --> 25:16.460
Oh, you brave boy!

25:19.020 --> 25:22.260
You poor, poor soldier of love.

25:33.620 --> 25:35.620
All right, mate.

25:41.580 --> 25:42.338
I've missed you.

25:42.339 --> 25:43.420
You've never done this before.

25:43.421 --> 25:45.179
I've missed you so much.

25:45.180 --> 25:47.259
Oh, God, you smell good.

25:47.260 --> 25:48.740
You smell so good!

26:01.340 --> 26:02.340
Dad?

26:05.940 --> 26:06.820
Hello?

26:49.100 --> 26:52.380
Hello? Anybody home?

26:57.620 --> 26:59.620
You're going to Australia?

27:01.180 --> 27:03.699
Yeah... Yeah, next week, for work.

27:03.700 --> 27:05.139
Didn't I say?

27:05.140 --> 27:07.059
No.

27:07.060 --> 27:08.899
No, you didn't say.

27:08.900 --> 27:12.699
Oh, sorry, sweetheart, my head's
all over the place at the moment.

27:12.700 --> 27:14.579
Are you going to get changed?

27:14.580 --> 27:18.260
Everyone says you're going
to fuck me over, Dad.

27:20.780 --> 27:22.940
I'm just going to get my suit on.

27:31.180 --> 27:33.699
It's work, Mini.

27:33.700 --> 27:36.659
I'm coming back.

27:36.660 --> 27:38.340
Come here.

27:44.860 --> 27:47.820
I want this to work
just as much as you do.

27:49.060 --> 27:50.460
I just feel really...

27:52.460 --> 27:53.540
Sad.

27:57.620 --> 27:59.339
Come with me.

27:59.340 --> 28:00.740
To Sydney.

28:01.980 --> 28:03.099
What?

28:03.100 --> 28:05.899
Yeah, why not? It'd be fun.

28:05.900 --> 28:07.379
You're serious?

28:07.380 --> 28:08.899
Very!

28:08.900 --> 28:10.739
Well hang on, let me think.

28:10.740 --> 28:15.579
No, no, don't think, just come!
Yes? Yes, Mini?

28:15.580 --> 28:17.259
Yeah, OK!

28:17.260 --> 28:20.860
Yeah, fantastic.
All right, I'm going to get changed.

28:34.540 --> 28:36.540
Right, let's show
you off then, shall we?

28:38.900 --> 28:40.539
Looking good, my man.

28:40.540 --> 28:42.099
All right, boys?

28:42.100 --> 28:43.939
See you, Sandy.

28:43.940 --> 28:46.380
Ladies.
Looking very, very beautiful.

28:47.940 --> 28:49.060
Thank you, darling.

28:49.061 --> 28:50.860
Incoming, brace yourself.

28:52.340 --> 28:55.339
Finally! Its a mess
and I can't find a fucking...

28:55.340 --> 28:57.619
Everything looks great,
what's the big deal?

28:57.620 --> 28:58.340
Excuse me?

28:58.341 --> 28:59.259
Ryan?!

28:59.260 --> 29:01.260
Ryan, I think Mini
might need a drink.

29:05.180 --> 29:06.779
It's a complete fucking mess.

29:06.780 --> 29:08.260
Look, really...

29:12.340 --> 29:15.979
Does he do it on purpose?
Just brush me off like that.

29:15.980 --> 29:17.900
No. No, never on purpose.

29:21.420 --> 29:22.620
Urgh!

29:23.740 --> 29:27.059
You're telling me you're not wetting
yourself with love for Boudoir?

29:27.060 --> 29:31.419
It tastes like...

29:31.420 --> 29:33.340
Oh, my God,
this stuff tastes like jizz!

29:33.341 --> 29:36.620
Wait, this one's all right,
this pink one.

29:38.140 --> 29:40.859
Hello, sexy. Check these cocktails.

29:40.860 --> 29:43.259
What are you doing here?
You weren't invited!

29:43.260 --> 29:44.979
Woah, babe, come on. Calm down.

29:44.980 --> 29:48.339
Let's have a jizz cocktail.
We can jam together, can't we?

29:48.340 --> 29:52.819
Just get out of here before my dad
sees you! I'm serious!

29:52.820 --> 29:54.100
For fucks sake!

29:56.460 --> 30:01.260
Hi, I'm Ryan,
events coordinating assistant.

30:03.460 --> 30:05.660
So nice meeting
some of Mini's friends.

30:08.660 --> 30:12.340
Right, well, have a good one, guys.

30:33.060 --> 30:35.539
That Ryan guy is a fucking douche.

30:35.540 --> 30:39.259
Yep. Do you think she's just doing
it to impress her dad?

30:39.260 --> 30:43.539
Is that what's been wrong with her?
She's been such a bitch recently.

30:43.540 --> 30:47.139
Girls will do anything to keep
hold of their dickhead dads.

30:47.140 --> 30:48.579
We should do something.

30:48.580 --> 30:51.899
I mean she seems, like... sad.

30:51.900 --> 30:55.260
Wait, why are you
so bothered anyway?

30:58.980 --> 31:02.019
Oh, my God. You love her!

31:02.020 --> 31:03.659
What? Shut up, no, I don't!

31:03.660 --> 31:05.699
You totally fucking do!

31:05.700 --> 31:07.899
You crank over her
every night, don't you!

31:07.900 --> 31:09.619
Right, that's insulting!

31:09.620 --> 31:14.020
No offence, but forget that one,
man. Not a chance in hell.

31:15.620 --> 31:16.620
Jackpot, bitches!

31:18.740 --> 31:20.299
Its not... It can't be?

31:20.300 --> 31:21.899
It is. It fucking is.

31:21.900 --> 31:23.979
It's a gold mine in those pockets.

31:23.980 --> 31:25.339
Amazing, share the love.

31:25.340 --> 31:28.659
Rack 'em and stack 'em, half pint.

31:28.660 --> 31:30.380
And let's get fucked!

31:34.300 --> 31:36.900
Whoa! Chill out, hoover!

31:38.100 --> 31:39.459
Right, there you go.

31:39.460 --> 31:41.540
You can have more when you're done.

31:43.460 --> 31:45.460
Oh, fuck, no.

31:48.140 --> 31:49.140
I need to talk to you.

31:49.141 --> 31:51.699
Hey, you're Mini's friend, right?

31:51.700 --> 31:52.420
Ah, who is this?

31:52.421 --> 31:55.099
Come on, mate,
let's get you a drink.

31:55.100 --> 31:58.059
I don't know what she's said,
all right, but she's not available.

31:58.060 --> 31:58.740
Do you understand?

31:58.741 --> 32:00.859
I swear to God,
if you don't shut up now...

32:00.860 --> 32:03.459
I'm a bit lost, mate.
What exactly is your problem?

32:03.460 --> 32:07.579
Do you know what you look like?
Fucking sleazing all over her?!

32:07.580 --> 32:09.500
You're a dick, mate.
She doesn't want you!

32:09.501 --> 32:11.699
Alo, fuck off. Please!

32:11.700 --> 32:14.419
I suggest you leave now.
You're upsetting my daughter.

32:14.420 --> 32:16.459
Can someone get security
in here now?

32:16.460 --> 32:18.300
She's been weird ever
since you turned up.

32:18.301 --> 32:20.059
Stop it! Just leave us alone!

32:20.060 --> 32:23.699
Did you set her up with this
dickhead? She's my girlfriend.

32:23.700 --> 32:26.179
You lot just fuck with her head!

32:26.180 --> 32:27.620
What are you talking about?

32:27.621 --> 32:29.899
Gregory, get this idiot
out of here now.

32:29.900 --> 32:31.699
That's enough, it's time to leave.

32:31.700 --> 32:34.579
Mini, Mini! Tell him to stop! Mini!

32:34.580 --> 32:37.659
I don't want you here!
I never wanted you at all.

32:37.660 --> 32:41.660
Do you understand? Now get the
fuck out, you deluded loser!

32:51.580 --> 32:54.979
I don't know what teenage drama
you've got yourself embroiled in,

32:54.980 --> 32:58.059
but try for a bit more
professionalism next time, OK?

32:58.060 --> 32:59.498
I'm so sorry, Gregory,
it won't happen again.

32:59.499 --> 33:00.740
No, it fucking won't.

33:03.700 --> 33:06.260
Dad! I'm so sorry. He's a twat.
I'm sorry.

33:36.980 --> 33:39.499
OK, so this is weird.

33:39.500 --> 33:42.019
I'm so sorry,
I don't know what's wrong.

33:42.020 --> 33:45.980
No, its OK, Mini.
This was a stupid idea.

33:53.260 --> 33:54.860
You're lovely, you know that?

34:00.460 --> 34:03.100
Take care, OK?

34:35.100 --> 34:36.219
Interesting evening.

34:36.221 --> 34:38.100
Don't start.

34:49.900 --> 34:51.339
Thanks.

34:51.340 --> 34:54.339
You're putting way too
much into it, you know.

34:54.340 --> 34:55.978
With your dad, I mean.

34:55.980 --> 34:58.299
Well, it'll be different this time.

34:58.300 --> 35:01.180
Why? Why do you suddenly need him?

35:03.620 --> 35:05.219
You tell me.

35:05.220 --> 35:07.940
No, Mini,
you need to start telling me!

35:12.100 --> 35:13.339
Liv...

35:13.340 --> 35:14.900
Deal me in, then.

35:27.180 --> 35:29.540
Sorry, am I interrupting something?

35:31.660 --> 35:35.380
I don't know, Franky.
I don't fucking know anymore.

35:41.220 --> 35:43.539
You still haven't told her.

35:43.540 --> 35:45.900
Who have you told, Mini?

35:47.900 --> 35:50.300
Have you told anyone?

35:54.340 --> 35:56.060
I haven't told myself.

36:19.620 --> 36:20.940
Dad?

36:23.660 --> 36:25.140
Yeah.

36:41.060 --> 36:42.460
I'm pregnant, Dad.

36:45.460 --> 36:47.740
And I... I don't know
what to do about it.

36:49.020 --> 36:51.380
I need someone to help me.

36:54.500 --> 36:55.820
I need you to help me.

37:01.900 --> 37:05.260
OK, darling. We can sort it.
It can all be sorted.

37:07.420 --> 37:09.059
It's probably all my fault.

37:09.060 --> 37:10.380
What? No, Dad.

37:11.740 --> 37:14.260
Could never just get over myself
and stick it out.

37:16.740 --> 37:19.220
The irony is I really fucking
loved your mum.

37:20.700 --> 37:22.500
You can help me now, Dad.

37:24.580 --> 37:26.300
I need you now.

37:28.860 --> 37:30.020
Deal.

37:33.860 --> 37:35.619
What about Sydney?

37:35.620 --> 37:40.379
It'll all be OK. We'll go
and we'll think when we're there.

37:40.380 --> 37:42.139
Does that sound OK?

37:42.140 --> 37:44.859
Can I stay at yours until we go?

37:44.860 --> 37:47.540
Come over tomorrow morning.

37:49.180 --> 37:51.339
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

37:51.340 --> 37:52.660
Thank you.

38:07.980 --> 38:10.180
Did you find my passport?

38:12.220 --> 38:14.459
Well, its got to be around here
somewhere!

38:14.460 --> 38:16.619
I'm not having it.

38:16.620 --> 38:19.619
I am not fucking having it!

38:19.620 --> 38:22.459
Mum! Stop it!
You're being ridiculous!

38:22.460 --> 38:23.940
No, no. Let go!

38:26.380 --> 38:28.819
Look what you've done, you tramp!

38:28.820 --> 38:30.139
I don't want you to go.

38:30.140 --> 38:32.099
I thought you'd be pleased!

38:32.100 --> 38:34.739
Fuck Eric in every room
in the house if you like.

38:34.740 --> 38:37.180
Pretend I wasn't here
to fuck everything up for you!

38:43.660 --> 38:45.299
At that first scan,

38:45.300 --> 38:50.659
when I saw your little heartbeat
on the screen, I loved you.

38:50.660 --> 38:53.899
More than anything else.
That hasn't changed.

38:53.900 --> 38:56.380
Why don't you believe me?

39:03.220 --> 39:04.660
Mini.

39:07.900 --> 39:10.739
Promise me
you'll keep yourself safe.

39:10.740 --> 39:14.180
Your dad, he never kept me safe.

39:19.820 --> 39:21.740
Maybe you weren't worth the effort.

39:32.260 --> 39:33.260
Dad?

39:48.980 --> 39:50.340
Dad?

40:24.300 --> 40:27.379
'I'm sorry, the number
you have dialled

40:27.380 --> 40:28.580
'is no longer in use.

40:28.581 --> 40:32.020
'I'm sorry, the number you have
dialled is no longer in use...'

41:35.900 --> 41:38.820
Farmboy, come down. I want to talk.

41:58.540 --> 42:02.779
Are you going to keep giving me
the silent treatment?

42:02.780 --> 42:07.579
I've just waded through
a sea of shit for you.

42:07.580 --> 42:09.100
Great, thanks.

42:11.420 --> 42:13.859
I'd just...

42:13.860 --> 42:18.540
you know, I'd quite like for you
not to be here right now.

42:20.500 --> 42:22.259
I'm telling you I'm sorry.

42:22.260 --> 42:24.740
And I'm telling you
it doesn't matter.

42:26.260 --> 42:27.820
I thought it was working.

42:29.020 --> 42:31.339
We... we agreed...

42:31.340 --> 42:33.419
I'm done, Mins.

42:33.420 --> 42:35.020
It's too much.

42:38.220 --> 42:41.620
It's too fucking exhausting
loving you.

42:44.660 --> 42:46.060
But, Alo, I...

42:49.260 --> 42:50.700
Say it.

42:58.580 --> 43:01.420
I don't think you know
how to love anything.

43:43.580 --> 43:46.019
Oh! Shall I...?

43:46.020 --> 43:47.299
Don't.

43:47.300 --> 43:49.459
Just leave it a minute, will you?

43:49.460 --> 43:51.619
You all right, love?

43:51.620 --> 43:54.180
Not sure, Eric.

43:56.540 --> 43:58.579
Your Mum's going to be
over the moon.

43:58.580 --> 44:01.219
You really love her, don't you?

44:01.220 --> 44:03.500
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

44:06.100 --> 44:09.859
And you're going to stay here
with me and Mum?

44:09.860 --> 44:12.260
That's the plan, love.

44:14.860 --> 44:16.379
OK.

44:16.380 --> 44:18.179
That's OK.

44:57.460 --> 44:59.020
Miss McGuiness?

45:17.580 --> 45:20.259
There it is. Look.

45:20.260 --> 45:22.020
No, thank you.

45:23.060 --> 45:25.259
Do you want to know what it is?

45:25.260 --> 45:27.660
I know what it is.
It's a fucking baby.

45:32.420 --> 45:33.980
Yes, it is.

45:37.340 --> 45:39.580
Look - it's your baby.

46:26.740 --> 46:27.940
I'm in trouble.

46:27.941 --> 46:29.299
What sort of trouble?

46:29.300 --> 46:31.659
Some guys.
I owe some money to some guys.

46:31.660 --> 46:35.819
I need 2,000. Cash.
And I need it tomorrow.

46:35.820 --> 46:39.179
Why don't you just stop trying
to fucking help me, all right?!

46:39.180 --> 46:40.620
Ah!

46:44.180 --> 46:47.299
You don't give a fuck about anyone!

46:47.300 --> 46:49.259
You're a headfuck, Franky.

46:49.260 --> 46:51.699
Nick! Matty.

46:51.700 --> 46:54.500
I'm coming home. I'm coming back.
