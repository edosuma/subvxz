00:14.212 --> 00:16.381
Do you even know who you are?

00:16.414 --> 00:18.216
<i>Are you your memories?</i>

00:18.250 --> 00:19.618
I don't remember that.

00:19.652 --> 00:21.287
I don't remember that at all.

00:23.254 --> 00:25.224
The focus tester

00:27.393 --> 00:28.628
- That's scary.

00:28.661 --> 00:30.663
<i>Or are you your past?</i>

00:30.696 --> 00:34.233
I hit the back of my head
and I forgot my entire life.

00:34.265 --> 00:36.368
Just like you hit

00:40.805 --> 00:47.746

00:50.582 --> 00:52.751
Have you ever looked
at a photograph of yourself

00:52.784 --> 00:55.454
and thought,
"That's what I look like?

00:55.487 --> 00:56.655
Ugh."

00:56.689 --> 00:58.691
We often think we look bad

00:58.723 --> 01:01.093
or not right in photos

01:01.127 --> 01:04.495
because photos show us
what we really look like

01:04.530 --> 01:06.231
to other people.

01:06.265 --> 01:08.733
The you that
you're used to seeing

01:08.766 --> 01:11.269
is mirror you.

01:11.302 --> 01:14.774
Every mirror you look into
reverses your face.

01:14.807 --> 01:17.176
Most selfie cameras do this too,

01:17.209 --> 01:20.612
so we tend to prefer
that version of ourselves.

01:20.646 --> 01:22.647
If you wanna see yourself
in a mirror

01:22.680 --> 01:24.783
the way other people see you
in real life,

01:24.816 --> 01:26.318
take two mirrors

01:26.352 --> 01:28.820
and position them
at a 90-degree angle.

01:28.853 --> 01:32.191
What you see won't be
yourself reversed,

01:32.224 --> 01:34.427
but how you look in real life.

01:34.459 --> 01:36.628
<i>So who would you say
you are really?</i>

01:36.662 --> 01:38.698
<i>Are you how you look?</i>

01:38.730 --> 01:39.798
<i>Or how you dress?</i>

01:40.081 --> 01:42.951
<i>Or are you the atoms
that make you up?</i>

01:43.734 --> 01:46.805
Because all of those things
change throughout your life.

01:46.838 --> 01:48.607
Ah, maybe
the real common thread,

01:48.639 --> 01:50.409
that which doesn't change,

01:50.442 --> 01:52.110
is your history,

01:52.142 --> 01:53.544

01:56.213 --> 01:58.749

they actually happened.

01:58.832 --> 02:02.670
Does that mean
we don't know ourselves?

02:05.772 --> 02:07.441
False memories are

02:07.475 --> 02:10.378
frighteningly easy to create.

02:10.412 --> 02:11.862
Today, we're gonna make some,

02:11.880 --> 02:13.610

a little fun doing it.

We have created a fake game show

02:50.318 --> 02:52.554
- Timothy DeLaGhetto.
- How's it going, man.

02:52.587 --> 02:53.898
- Thanks for coming in.
- Thanks for having me.

02:53.922 --> 02:56.692
- Excited to kinda
dive into some memories?

02:56.725 --> 02:58.168
- Yeah, I don't really know
what to expect.

02:58.192 --> 02:59.637
To begin, though,
let's give the audience

02:59.661 --> 03:01.263
a taste of your life.

03:01.295 --> 03:03.632
Oh, my God, let's take a look.

03:03.664 --> 03:05.768
So Tim was raised in California

03:05.800 --> 03:07.311
where he and his parents
owned and operated

03:07.335 --> 03:08.745
- a Thai food restaurant.
- [laughing]

03:08.769 --> 03:10.905
Tim found popularity
as a rapper,

03:10.938 --> 03:13.074
comedian, actor,
and Internet personality,

03:13.108 --> 03:17.179
and has attracted
over 3 million subscribers.

03:17.211 --> 03:20.949
In order to... to kind of see
how you became who you are today

03:20.983 --> 03:23.953
let's go back to who you were.
- Let's do it.

03:23.985 --> 03:25.687
- We spoke to your parents...
- Mm-hmm.

03:25.721 --> 03:27.065
And they told us
some of their favorite memories

03:27.089 --> 03:28.365
from when you were very,
very young.

03:28.389 --> 03:30.325
- Okay.<i>

03:35.062 --> 03:36.664
When you were seven,

03:36.698 --> 03:38.300
you were pretty much
held prisoner

03:38.333 --> 03:40.970
by a very controlling
school girl.

03:41.002 --> 03:42.870
The girl took control
of your life

03:42.904 --> 03:44.740
and always wanted to know
what you were doing.

03:44.773 --> 03:46.108
- I remember her.
Like, she was,

03:46.140 --> 03:48.042
like, my... my best friend,
sort of,

03:48.075 --> 03:50.144
but then she was also very,
like, possessive of me.

03:50.178 --> 03:51.680
But you guys aren't
together still.

03:51.712 --> 03:53.056
No, we might be
Facebook friends.

03:53.080 --> 03:54.850
- Okay.
Here's a memory.

03:54.882 --> 03:57.386
You weren't a crybaby
on the first day of school...

03:57.418 --> 03:59.187
- Yeah.
- Until you noticed that

03:59.221 --> 04:01.924
all the other kids were crying
and then you joined in.

04:01.956 --> 04:03.233
You know,
I empathize with people...

04:03.257 --> 04:04.892
- Right.
- And, uh, I was just kind of,

04:04.925 --> 04:07.662
like, helping them feel like
we were all a team.

04:07.696 --> 04:09.398
<i>Now here's the fake story</i>

04:09.430 --> 04:11.733
<i>we made up out of thin air.</i>

04:11.767 --> 04:13.202
- Here's another memory.
- Mm-hmm.

04:13.234 --> 04:14.878
When you were about
four or five years old...

04:14.902 --> 04:16.672
- Mm-kay.
- You actually took a ride

04:16.704 --> 04:19.406
in a hot air balloon,
but you dropped something

04:19.440 --> 04:22.645
from the balloon.

04:22.677 --> 04:24.155
- I don't remember that at all.
[laughs]

04:24.179 --> 04:26.015
- Really?
- Yeah, like, at all.

04:26.047 --> 04:27.357
- We're going deep... far back.
- I didn't even know

04:27.381 --> 04:29.050
I've ever been in
a hot air balloon

04:29.083 --> 04:30.927
until you just reminded me.
- It was in Echo Park.

04:30.951 --> 04:32.321
- Was it?
- Yeah.

04:32.354 --> 04:33.589

04:42.763 --> 04:45.199

04:45.232 --> 04:47.869
Once, you even tried

04:47.902 --> 04:50.004
to stop a car
driving down the street.

04:50.037 --> 04:52.015
- Yeah, try to stop a car,
like, with my... with my hand

04:52.039 --> 04:53.217

- Did you succeed?

04:53.241 --> 04:54.285

four or five years old,

Uh...

05:20.469 --> 05:22.971
Oh, I mean, I had, like,
some action figures, I think.

05:23.003 --> 05:25.174
Um, I do remember,
like, losing one.

05:25.207 --> 05:27.876
I'm not sure, like... that was,
like, the... what happened.

05:27.909 --> 05:31.046
If I, uh, was
in a hot air balloon.

05:31.078 --> 05:32.715
