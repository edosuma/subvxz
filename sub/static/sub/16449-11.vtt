WEBVTT

00:01.585 --> 00:04.754
Now, I'm about to show you
some very sensitive information

00:05.047 --> 00:07.757
the final point totals
each of you achieved

00:07.841 --> 00:09.342
for all your actions on Earth.

00:12.262 --> 00:14.597
Whoa. Your point total
was crazy high, Eleanor.

00:14.681 --> 00:16.098
Oh, sorry.

00:16.725 --> 00:18.976
Crazy High Eleanor
was my nickname in college.

00:19.061 --> 00:22.605
I accidentally saw these point totals
when Michael was fixing a sinkhole.

00:22.981 --> 00:24.232
It gave me an idea.

00:24.650 --> 00:27.318
We will apply the formula
to Eleanor's actions here

00:27.402 --> 00:30.112
in the Good Place,
and if you earn enough new points

00:30.197 --> 00:31.989
then we could argue
that you should stay here.

00:32.074 --> 00:33.533
- Would that work?
- Don't know.

00:33.617 --> 00:36.994
Never had to prove someone
belonged here before.

00:37.287 --> 00:40.831
But the judge will be here soon,
and this is the best way to build our case.

00:41.208 --> 00:45.002
Eleanor, I made you this points tracker
last night.

00:45.087 --> 00:48.422
It will calculate the moral value
of everything you do here.

00:48.507 --> 00:51.008
It's kind of a Fitbit for your soul.

00:51.093 --> 00:52.426
Oh, I used to have a Fitbit.

00:53.470 --> 00:56.514
But I guess now I can't cheat
by taping it to the desk fan.

00:56.598 --> 01:00.393
You took credit
for the fitness achievements of a desk fan?

01:00.477 --> 01:03.187
I only did it to stick it
to my stupid friend Jen

01:03.272 --> 01:05.106
who said there was no way I'd ever use it.

01:05.190 --> 01:06.440
Oh. You showed her.

01:06.525 --> 01:11.654
Now, the average point total
for a resident here is roughly 1.2 million.

01:11.738 --> 01:14.615
Right now, based on everything
that you did on Earth

01:15.033 --> 01:18.077
you have negative 4,008.

01:18.161 --> 01:20.037
That's not great...

01:20.914 --> 01:24.500
but I'm gonna do nice things
for every goober in this place

01:24.585 --> 01:28.838
until my point total is so high
I can rub it in all their smug faces.

01:28.922 --> 01:30.673
You just lost five points.

01:39.349 --> 01:41.434
Hello! Hi, how are you?

01:43.312 --> 01:46.689
There has to be something bigger I can do
than holding the door and waving.

01:46.773 --> 01:49.609
There's no way every Walmart greeter
is in the Good Place.

01:50.485 --> 01:51.527
Wal... mart?

01:51.612 --> 01:54.447
It's a place regular people go.
You haven't heard of it.

01:54.531 --> 01:55.781
Look, I know this is tedious

01:55.866 --> 01:57.491
but holding a door for someone
is three points.

01:57.576 --> 01:59.201
If you do it for everyone
in the neighbourhood

01:59.286 --> 02:01.996
then that's almost a thousand points
for just a start.

02:02.080 --> 02:05.333
Besides, all the big-ticket items
are impossible, I'm afraid.

02:05.417 --> 02:08.294
It's not as if you could, you know,
"sacrifice your life to save others"

02:08.378 --> 02:10.546
or "change the consciousness of a nation".

02:11.757 --> 02:13.716
Both of which I did, by the way. Such fun.

02:14.134 --> 02:15.384
Have a wonderful day.

02:16.678 --> 02:18.054
This is pointless.

02:18.722 --> 02:22.433
The ticker isn't even going up,
and everyone's giving me the stink eye.

02:23.477 --> 02:26.312
Eleanor, everyone hates you.

02:26.897 --> 02:28.022
Well, fork you too.

02:28.106 --> 02:29.357
No, this is good.

02:29.691 --> 02:32.068
Now that we know,
we can actually do something about it.

02:32.486 --> 02:35.446
And I am an expert at mediating conflict

02:35.530 --> 02:37.823
like when my friends
Scary, Sporty, Posh, and Baby

02:37.908 --> 02:40.618
had an issue with my other friend,
Archbishop Desmond Tutu.

02:42.037 --> 02:45.915
Yeah, I don't know what I love more
about our morning hard boiled egg routine

02:46.041 --> 02:47.667
the eggs or the routine.

02:48.085 --> 02:50.920
Oh, sorry. You know, I was thinking
this morning I'd have oatmeal.

02:51.797 --> 02:53.214
Just kidding. Of course it's eggs.

02:55.008 --> 02:58.594
Um, actually, this morning,
there's a little surprise in yours.

03:05.560 --> 03:07.269
"I love you." How cute.

03:08.605 --> 03:10.147
I love you too, egg.

03:10.982 --> 03:14.694
Oh, no, no, Chidi.
That... That's me saying that to you.

03:15.445 --> 03:16.320
I love you.

03:19.032 --> 03:21.867
Oh.

03:23.078 --> 03:26.706
Well, that is... something.

03:26.790 --> 03:29.625
I know you've gone through a lot,
and now I'm throwing this at you

03:29.710 --> 03:32.128
but I just... I had to tell you how I feel.

03:33.004 --> 03:35.715
I love you. No need to respond.
- Great.

03:36.133 --> 03:39.218
Well, at some point, you'll respond, right?

03:39.636 --> 03:40.511
I just meant no rush.

03:42.222 --> 03:43.639
You wanna talk about eggs again?

03:54.234 --> 03:55.943
Hm, this isn't right.

03:56.027 --> 03:58.279
I'm sorry.
I've never kissed anyone before.

03:58.864 --> 04:01.198
Is one tongue OK? I can add more tongues.

04:01.283 --> 04:02.158
No, that's not it.

04:02.868 --> 04:05.494
We're married now,
but we still haven't told your dad.

04:05.579 --> 04:08.998
Once again, Michael is not my dad,
and we shouldn't tell him.

04:09.166 --> 04:10.750
If Michael finds out that we're married

04:10.834 --> 04:12.918
then he'll know
you're not Tahani's soul mate

04:13.003 --> 04:15.838
and then he'll know that you're
really Jason and not Jianyu.

04:16.548 --> 04:17.923
He'd send you to the Bad Place.

04:18.467 --> 04:20.092
Hm, I don't want to lose you, girl...

04:20.177 --> 04:23.137
I'm not a girl.
- ...but also, I'm tired of living a lie.

04:23.221 --> 04:24.263
We gotta go public.

04:24.347 --> 04:27.808
I hate all this hiding,
kissing inside like losers.

04:27.893 --> 04:34.482
I wish we were in Florida, kissing outside,
near a swamp with some old tyres in it

04:35.650 --> 04:38.819
watching a flamingo trying to mate
with somebody's old gun.

04:39.654 --> 04:41.572
I want us to have the life we deserve.

04:45.035 --> 04:46.744
Pillboi, let's talk big picture.

04:46.828 --> 04:48.120
You know I love Jacksonville.

04:48.205 --> 04:49.246
J-town.

04:50.081 --> 04:53.334
It's easily one of the top ten swamp cities
in north-eastern Florida

04:53.752 --> 04:57.463
but if we're gonna make it in the DJ game,
we gotta get to Miami.

04:57.756 --> 05:01.759
Yeah, but Miami's expensive.
We just don't got that skrilla, B.

05:02.177 --> 05:03.928
I mean, I got ten bucks to my name

05:04.012 --> 05:07.014
and I spent eight of it on this burrito
and the other two on guac.

05:07.766 --> 05:08.808
I know what we gotta do.

05:10.393 --> 05:12.228
We're gonna rob this restaurant.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.939
Great idea! But what if we get caught?

05:15.023 --> 05:19.026
We'll just get married
so that no one can testify against us.

05:19.110 --> 05:20.027
Dope.

05:20.821 --> 05:21.821
Yo.

05:22.239 --> 05:23.739
I got diarrhoea. I'll be right back.

05:24.032 --> 05:25.783
Me too. I'll race you.

05:26.660 --> 05:27.785
Best friends!

05:28.286 --> 05:31.539
Thank you all for participating
in our focus group for Fake Eleanor.

05:31.623 --> 05:33.165
Think of this as an open forum

05:33.250 --> 05:36.418
for you to air any and all grievances
that you may carry against her.

05:36.711 --> 05:40.548
I was flying on the second day,
and when you caused the trash storm

05:40.632 --> 05:43.801
I crashed into a rotting turkey carcass,
and it exploded.

05:43.885 --> 05:45.970
Oh, dear.
- All this cartilage and bone

05:46.054 --> 05:47.304
got tangled up in my hair

05:47.389 --> 05:51.559
and its beak got smashed against my nose
and its skin was all over my skin.

05:52.602 --> 05:54.979
I didn't know where I ended
and the turkey carcass began.

05:56.064 --> 05:59.275
Well, if it makes you feel any better,
your skin looks amazing.

06:00.235 --> 06:02.319
My café got destroyed by the giant frog.

06:02.612 --> 06:04.864
Then I reopened it
and it fell into the sinkhole.

06:05.740 --> 06:07.575
Just like me. I fell in too.

06:07.826 --> 06:09.410
Who else feels that Eleanor has ruined

06:09.494 --> 06:11.328
every moment of your existence
since you arrived?

06:12.789 --> 06:13.831
Excellent.

06:13.915 --> 06:16.083
I must confer with Eleanor for a tick

06:16.167 --> 06:18.460
so please, just, uh,
enjoy the lemonade and cookies.

06:20.297 --> 06:22.798
Seems everyone's problem with me is me.

06:23.300 --> 06:24.592
Yes, it would appear that way.

06:25.135 --> 06:27.344
The last moment they were happy
was at my party.

06:28.513 --> 06:29.638
I've seen this before.

06:30.140 --> 06:32.892
After one of my events,
there's a real endorphin crash.

06:34.519 --> 06:35.936
We have to recreate that party.

06:36.563 --> 06:40.149
We have to take them back to that night
before I started affecting the neighbourhood

06:40.233 --> 06:41.692
and give them a fresh start.

06:41.776 --> 06:45.696
Yes, of course.
We must throw the perfect party

06:45.780 --> 06:47.865
or else you'll be tortured
by demons forever.

06:48.325 --> 06:50.910
This will be the fourth most important party
I have ever thrown.

06:53.496 --> 06:54.705
Janet, there you are.

06:55.123 --> 06:57.917
Some residents are complaining
that you're not responding to...

06:59.044 --> 07:00.461
I'm sorry, what's going on?

07:00.754 --> 07:02.254
Is that a... A wedding ring?

07:02.631 --> 07:04.798
Yes. I'm married.

07:06.551 --> 07:07.426
To whom?

07:07.510 --> 07:11.555
Sorry, my protocol forbids me
from telling you any private information

07:11.640 --> 07:13.015
about any resident.

07:14.684 --> 07:16.185
Is it that person?

07:16.269 --> 07:20.397
Jianyu, the man standing right there
also wearing a wedding band?

07:21.524 --> 07:22.900
Dad...

07:23.360 --> 07:24.443
we need to talk.

07:30.325 --> 07:32.451
I just want to make sure
that I have this right. Um...

07:33.119 --> 07:39.583
Jianyu is not a Taiwanese monk
but rather someone named Jason Mendoza

07:39.668 --> 07:42.920
a failed DJ from Jacksonville, Florida...

07:43.004 --> 07:46.674
I wasn't a failed DJ. I was pre-successful.

07:46.883 --> 07:49.551
...and you two are married?

07:49.636 --> 07:51.804
Hells yeah, homie. We love each other.

07:52.514 --> 07:54.139
Just like Romeo and Juliet.

07:54.224 --> 07:57.476
Romeo was the name of my dog
and Juliet was the name of my Roomba.

07:58.269 --> 07:59.436
She is my everything.

07:59.896 --> 08:03.315
She makes the bass drop... in my heart.

08:03.400 --> 08:07.403
And Jason is a person who was near me,
and then he asked me to marry him

08:07.737 --> 08:09.613
and there is nothing in my protocol

08:09.698 --> 08:11.532
that specifically barred that
from happening...

08:12.534 --> 08:14.159
so I agreed.
- Love you too, babe.

08:19.165 --> 08:20.207
Janet...

08:20.917 --> 08:22.626
please tell me how this could have happened.

08:22.711 --> 08:23.585
Unclear.

08:23.670 --> 08:27.423
As you know, each time I am updated,
I accrue new knowledge and abilities.

08:27.757 --> 08:30.050
My suspicion is that when I was rebooted

08:30.343 --> 08:33.846
I bonded with Jason in a way
that I have never bonded with anyone before.

08:34.305 --> 08:36.849
I seem to have gained
a new understanding of love.

08:37.183 --> 08:39.184
I also learned how to do this.

08:43.106 --> 08:45.232
I will speak to you later. Go to your void.

08:45.316 --> 08:46.567
OK.

08:46.651 --> 08:47.735
No, Janet, come back!

08:47.819 --> 08:48.861
Hi there.
- Go!

08:48.945 --> 08:49.778
Sure thing.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.280
No!
- Stop doing that.

08:51.364 --> 08:52.114
Me?

08:52.198 --> 08:53.282
- Go!
- Good-bye.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.284
Janet, come back.
- I love you.

08:55.535 --> 08:56.577
I love you too.

08:58.788 --> 09:00.039
That is Sachveer

09:00.623 --> 09:05.711
and his problem with me is...
Oh, one of the giraffes tried to hump him.

09:07.005 --> 09:09.298
It's gonna be hard to keep
a straight face tonight

09:09.507 --> 09:12.176
but then I remember
I could be tortured for all of eternity

09:12.260 --> 09:13.927
and that is pretty sobering.

09:15.180 --> 09:16.722
Hey, can I ask your advice on something?

09:17.849 --> 09:18.891
Are you sure, dude?

09:18.975 --> 09:21.393
Isn't there someone else better
you could ask

09:21.478 --> 09:23.854
like literally anyone else?

09:23.938 --> 09:27.107
Well, it's a sensitive matter, and you...
You do know me pretty well.

09:27.400 --> 09:30.611
Now I understand that our relationship
has gotten more complicated recently

09:30.695 --> 09:32.112
due to your feelings being expressed--

09:32.197 --> 09:34.740
Dude, if you do the "Chidi" thing

09:34.824 --> 09:37.951
where you have to re-explain
the entire world before asking a question

09:38.036 --> 09:39.828
we are both going to grow old
and die again.

09:40.163 --> 09:41.038
Out with it.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.665
See? Yes. You do know me pretty well.

09:44.459 --> 09:45.542
Er, so, here it is:

09:46.336 --> 09:48.253
Real Eleanor said she loves me.

09:48.922 --> 09:51.548
Hey, man, nice pull. She's a great person.

09:51.633 --> 09:52.674
I don't know what to do.

09:52.884 --> 09:56.720
I mean, we are soul mates,
so I probably do love her

09:56.805 --> 09:59.890
but then again,
how do I know if my motivation is correct?

09:59.974 --> 10:01.642
Maybe I think I'm supposed to love her

10:01.726 --> 10:03.560
but if I tell her that I love her
for the wrong reasons

10:03.645 --> 10:04.603
it won't mean anything.

10:04.687 --> 10:06.146
You have a tendency
to overthink things.

10:07.023 --> 10:10.359
Turn off that giant brain,
and just say you love her too.

10:11.194 --> 10:13.487
You think?
- If this were some random person

10:13.571 --> 10:15.864
you hooked up with at a Diamondbacks game
in the parking lot

10:15.949 --> 10:18.575
behind the Porta Potties -
not based on a real example -

10:18.660 --> 10:20.369
I would say keep mulling

10:20.912 --> 10:22.955
but, this is your soul mate.

10:23.540 --> 10:24.832
She's universe-approved.

10:26.417 --> 10:28.168
Tell her you love her.

10:28.253 --> 10:30.921
Hey, your score just went up 20 points.

10:31.005 --> 10:32.506
Yeah, 'cos I give great advice.

10:33.174 --> 10:35.843
Now maybe you'll finally listen to me
and take off those glasses.

10:36.219 --> 10:39.429
We are in the afterlife, dummy,
nature's Lasik.

10:43.017 --> 10:45.435
OK, I think I figured this out.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.564
There is a real Jianyu

10:48.648 --> 10:52.276
a Taiwanese monk who took an oath of silence
at the age of eight.

10:52.777 --> 10:57.156
But, three months ago,
he went into such a deep meditative state

10:57.240 --> 10:59.324
that he registered as dead

10:59.409 --> 11:02.369
and when you died
at that exact same moment

11:02.453 --> 11:04.496
our system mistook you for him -

11:04.998 --> 11:08.041
perhaps because you share
the exact same IQ.

11:08.418 --> 11:10.252
Cool.
- No, not cool.

11:10.336 --> 11:12.462
He stopped learning at the age of seven.

11:13.339 --> 11:14.214
OK...

11:14.716 --> 11:17.885
so, now, this is sort of
a quick litmus test

11:17.969 --> 11:22.472
basic questions designed to tell
whether you are fundamentally good or bad.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.976
Number one:
Did you ever commit a serious crime?

11:26.060 --> 11:29.646
Yes, I blew up a guy's speedboat
after he sued me.

11:30.690 --> 11:33.150
And I stole an old lady's fake leg once
on a dare.

11:35.445 --> 11:37.696
Did you ever have
a personalised license plate?

11:37.780 --> 11:39.489
Yeah, dawg, "I LOVE BUTTS".

11:40.992 --> 11:42.492
Have... Have you ever paid money

11:42.577 --> 11:45.913
to hear music
performed by California funk rock band

11:45.997 --> 11:47.414
the Red Hot Chili Peppers?

11:47.498 --> 11:50.500
Yo, the Chilis?
I saw them in concert like 50 times.

11:50.585 --> 11:52.294
I once got arrested trying to steal

11:52.378 --> 11:53.503
Flea's bass guitar.

11:54.714 --> 11:57.216
Oh, that was another serious crime
I committed.

11:57.300 --> 11:59.218
I should have mentioned that earlier.

11:59.302 --> 12:03.388
Is it just me, or am I acing this test?

12:03.473 --> 12:04.514
Oh, this is bad.

12:05.767 --> 12:07.059
Oh, this is so, so bad.

12:07.852 --> 12:10.687
Oh, I thought I had everything under control
when I found Eleanor

12:10.772 --> 12:12.189
but somehow you are...

12:12.732 --> 12:13.690
you're so much worse...

12:14.025 --> 12:15.651
No, don't... Don't touch... Ah.

12:16.736 --> 12:17.778
Oh.

12:19.030 --> 12:20.614
How does that still work?

12:20.698 --> 12:24.201
Look, I know you're freaking out
but you're Janet's father

12:24.786 --> 12:27.079
and like it or not, we're family.

12:27.163 --> 12:28.747
Everything's gonna be fine, homie.

12:29.457 --> 12:30.499
I promise.

12:32.418 --> 12:34.461
I don't know, B.
What if it doesn't work?

12:34.545 --> 12:38.715
Hey, we thought of everything
except for an alibi and an escape route

12:38.800 --> 12:40.342
but we'll figure it out as we go.

12:40.551 --> 12:43.053
You don't wanna overthink these things.
- I'm kinda freaking out here.

12:43.388 --> 12:44.888
Pillboi, I got you.

12:45.390 --> 12:47.015
This plan is foolproof.

12:47.433 --> 12:50.269
And when it's over,
we can finally have the lives we deserve.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.236
<i>DiGiorno!</i>

12:59.320 --> 13:03.615
I am a safe installer,
here to install-a da safe.

13:04.117 --> 13:07.577
So just a-point
to where the guacamole money is

13:07.662 --> 13:13.250
and I'll-a install-a da safe-a in da,
how you say...? A-place.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.254
Yeah, hi, we're being robbed.

13:18.756 --> 13:20.882
No... J, they're on to us, man.

13:20.967 --> 13:23.844
His hat's a golf ball,
and he's a got a terrible moustache.

13:23.928 --> 13:25.220
We need to get married now.

13:25.805 --> 13:28.265
I do, for, uh, always and forever.

13:29.058 --> 13:30.267
I do!

13:31.602 --> 13:32.728
Lighting's nice.

13:32.979 --> 13:36.023
The cocktail shrimp are sitting in a bowl
instead of flying through the sky.

13:36.107 --> 13:40.068
So far so good. And this music is banging.

13:41.029 --> 13:43.530
Good Place. Good Place. Good Place...
- Oh, right. Sorry.

13:44.240 --> 13:49.036
So, uh... Did you... do that thing
that we talked about?

13:49.120 --> 13:51.455
I'll get to it as soon as I finish my drink.

13:51.539 --> 13:53.498
That is what you said an hour ago.
- I know.

13:53.791 --> 13:56.877
Here's my secret: I keep refilling my drink
before I'm finished.

13:58.296 --> 14:00.756
Loop hole.
- Respect. Loop holes rule.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.507
Hey. Great party, Eleanor.

14:02.592 --> 14:03.633
Thank you.

14:04.719 --> 14:07.262
They probably didn't have many parties
in the Bad Place, huh?

14:07.347 --> 14:09.598
Actually, we had a party every day.

14:09.682 --> 14:12.017
It's what they called it
when they pulled you apart with ropes.

14:12.101 --> 14:16.146
Oh, a part-y. Ha. I get it. That's funny.

14:16.939 --> 14:18.273
You probably didn't think so.

14:19.400 --> 14:21.818
OK. I'm gonna leave you two alone.

14:26.908 --> 14:31.828
So, um, have you given any more thought...
to what I said?

14:31.913 --> 14:34.664
Yep. I have a timetable to say...

14:36.209 --> 14:38.001
what you want me to say.
I have a whole plan.

14:38.336 --> 14:39.378
I understand.

14:39.879 --> 14:42.756
I'll wait for your answer,
even if it takes until the end of time

14:43.883 --> 14:47.594
which, I guess, it could
since that's how long we'll be here.

14:50.807 --> 14:52.265
♪ Living it up ♪

14:53.226 --> 14:54.267
♪ Living it up ♪

14:55.603 --> 14:56.645
♪ Living it up... ♪

14:58.272 --> 14:59.314
You OK, Dad?

14:59.816 --> 15:01.691
You look like you took
a bad dose of Molly.

15:01.776 --> 15:04.861
And I should know.
I sold fake Molly to a lot of people.

15:05.154 --> 15:08.407
Oh, that was another serious crime
I committed.

15:08.783 --> 15:09.783
Hello, Michael.

15:10.118 --> 15:12.285
I'd like to inform you
that Shawn, the judge

15:12.370 --> 15:13.745
will be arriving tomorrow morning.

15:13.830 --> 15:14.788
Thank you, Janet.

15:18.418 --> 15:19.459
Jason...

15:20.253 --> 15:21.962
I have to attend Eleanor's party

15:22.547 --> 15:25.298
so, I'm going to leave you here,
in this locked room.

15:25.800 --> 15:27.384
I'm in jail?
- No, no, no, no.

15:28.594 --> 15:31.263
This is the Good Place.
We don't put people in jail.

15:31.848 --> 15:33.932
It's just a room where you have been put

15:34.642 --> 15:37.894
in the interests of public safety,
as a form of punishment

15:37.979 --> 15:40.063
and from which there is no exit.

15:40.481 --> 15:42.607
OK? Bye.

15:48.990 --> 15:52.993
Eleanor, for an utter novice,
you have thrown a lovely party.

15:53.077 --> 15:55.787
Well, thanks, but it's not working.

15:56.414 --> 15:57.789
Not one more point.

15:58.708 --> 15:59.583
What the fork?

16:00.418 --> 16:02.586
Oh, look, Michael's here. He can help.

16:03.004 --> 16:06.840
Michael, would you do us the honour
of saying a few words?

16:07.133 --> 16:09.342
I don't know
that I'm in the right frame of mind.

16:09.427 --> 16:10.886
Please, they'll listen to you.

16:11.179 --> 16:12.679
Just pay me a few compliments.

16:12.763 --> 16:16.224
You know, I'm great, heart of a champion,
basically your muse, you get it.

16:18.811 --> 16:19.853
Attention, everyone.

16:19.937 --> 16:22.105
Michael would like to say a few words.

16:22.815 --> 16:24.900
Hello, everyone.
Good to see you all here

16:26.027 --> 16:29.946
mingling around with
your various secrets.

16:31.157 --> 16:33.742
Who really knows which of you
are who you say you are?

16:34.368 --> 16:37.287
No way to know
unless I pull your skeletons out, right?

16:37.622 --> 16:38.663
OK...

16:39.874 --> 16:40.916
Take her easy.

16:42.543 --> 16:43.418
Yes...

16:44.295 --> 16:48.632
Well said. Now, we shall hear
from tonight's featured guest.

16:48.716 --> 16:51.551
She's kind. She's humble

16:51.969 --> 16:54.638
She's the Walmart of friends...

16:55.014 --> 16:55.972
Did I use that word right?

16:57.308 --> 16:58.266
...Eleanor Shellstrop.

17:00.978 --> 17:03.104
Hi, everyone, I'm Eleanor.

17:03.189 --> 17:06.691
Uh... original flavour,
not new and improved.

17:07.568 --> 17:10.779
I know a lot of bad stuff
has happened because of me

17:10.863 --> 17:13.657
but I never meant to hurt you

17:13.741 --> 17:15.742
so if I caused you any harm

17:16.452 --> 17:18.245
I'm truly sorry.

17:18.329 --> 17:22.290
That's nice, Eleanor,
but I still crashed into a turkey carcass.

17:22.375 --> 17:23.583
And I fell into a sinkhole.

17:23.668 --> 17:25.252
And my dog got kicked into the sun.

17:25.586 --> 17:28.505
What can you possibly say to us
that'll make up for your actions?

17:30.466 --> 17:31.716
<i>Pobody's nerfect?</i>

17:38.349 --> 17:41.226
"Pobody's nerfect"? That's hilarious.

17:41.310 --> 17:44.771
Like "nobody's perfect"
with the letters switched.

17:44.855 --> 17:46.856
That's very funny.
<i>- It's nerfect!</i>

17:53.489 --> 17:55.031
Great party, Eleanor.

17:55.533 --> 17:59.995
I hope you get to stay,
<i>or should I say, pobody's nerfect!</i>

18:00.079 --> 18:03.206
That doesn't really... apply here.

18:04.250 --> 18:07.335
<i>Well, pobody's nerfect!</i>
- Nailed it.

18:08.629 --> 18:10.839
Eleanor, great job tonight.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.674
Have you checked the, uh, the ticker?

18:12.758 --> 18:14.759
- I could really use some good news.
- OK.

18:16.929 --> 18:19.431
Oh, come on!

18:19.515 --> 18:21.725
Well, the nightmare continues.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.352
The nightmare continues.

18:25.479 --> 18:26.646
How did this not work?

18:29.859 --> 18:32.986
There's no way to increase my point total

18:33.362 --> 18:37.741
because everything I'm doing
is out of self-preservation.

18:37.825 --> 18:40.910
I don't understand.
- My motivation is corrupt.

18:40.995 --> 18:42.203
Even when I do nice things

18:42.288 --> 18:44.831
I'm only doing them,
so I can get something out of it -

18:45.082 --> 18:46.374
the ability to stay here

18:46.459 --> 18:49.628
which means none of this
had any real moral value.

18:49.712 --> 18:51.129
It doesn't count.

18:53.049 --> 18:54.090
Holy shirt.

18:55.593 --> 18:57.010
I know what I have to do.

19:00.931 --> 19:02.641
OK, I am almost done

19:02.725 --> 19:05.435
with these personalised "I'm sorry" notes
to everyone in the neighbourhood.

19:05.519 --> 19:07.687
I need you guys to deliver
everyone their notes

19:07.772 --> 19:09.022
along with those T-shirts.

19:11.525 --> 19:15.445
Well, granted, these are hilarious,
but how is this going to help?

19:15.529 --> 19:16.404
Just trust me.

19:17.573 --> 19:19.032
I'm gonna get the points.

19:24.330 --> 19:26.998
Oh, good morning, Dad. Where you been?

19:27.083 --> 19:29.793
Oh, just walking around,
contemplating my failure

19:30.670 --> 19:34.005
wishing for the sweet release
of eternal extinction.

19:34.298 --> 19:36.049
Cool. Hey...

19:36.676 --> 19:38.426
um, why don't you want me to see Janet?

19:39.178 --> 19:42.722
I'm a good guy. All I want
is to give Janet the life she deserves.

19:42.807 --> 19:45.642
Janet is not built for human life

19:46.435 --> 19:49.020
and I'm not sure you're much of a provider.

19:50.022 --> 19:52.023
Do you even remember how you died?

19:52.108 --> 19:53.942
No, not really.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.235
It's a little fuzzy.

19:55.444 --> 19:56.486
I lived in Florida

19:56.570 --> 20:00.782
so I assume an escaped zoo animal
rampaged through a mini-golf course?

20:00.866 --> 20:04.244
You and your friend, Pillboi,
were trying to rob a restaurant.

20:04.328 --> 20:05.370
Pillboi!

20:06.163 --> 20:08.957
Right. And then...
And then the cops showed up.

20:11.627 --> 20:15.255
So the plan was to pretend
to install a safe

20:15.339 --> 20:17.465
with your friend hiding inside it.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.843
He pops out,
steals the money from the restaurant

20:20.136 --> 20:22.887
gets back in the safe,
then you come in and uninstall it.

20:22.972 --> 20:25.640
I refuse to discuss
my fifth amendment rights

20:25.891 --> 20:28.476
until I concur with your attorney.

20:28.936 --> 20:29.978
Sure.

20:30.312 --> 20:34.023
Look, we found your buddy's plans.
We know he was the... brains.

20:34.358 --> 20:35.608
You were just an accomplice.

20:36.026 --> 20:37.652
If you're lucky, you might get probation.

20:38.696 --> 20:39.738
Jason going to jail?

20:40.197 --> 20:41.823
No, man. Jason's dead.

20:42.616 --> 20:44.075
He suffocated in that safe.

20:44.493 --> 20:45.535
There were no air holes.

20:45.828 --> 20:47.620
Plus he did a bunch of whippits
while he was in there

20:47.705 --> 20:48.955
which couldn't have helped.

20:49.039 --> 20:50.749
At least he died doing what he loved...

20:51.459 --> 20:52.333
a bunch of whippits.

20:53.419 --> 20:55.628
Now he's never gonna get the life
he truly deserved.

20:56.046 --> 20:57.922
Eh, I think he got
roughly what he deserved.

20:59.049 --> 21:01.301
I suffocated to death in... in a safe?

21:01.719 --> 21:02.761
I'm a moron.

21:03.554 --> 21:05.180
Hey... Hey, Janet?

21:05.264 --> 21:06.139
Hi, there.

21:07.433 --> 21:10.059
Janet, you need to leave me.

21:10.478 --> 21:12.812
Why?
- You're the smartest girl in the world...

21:12.897 --> 21:15.940
- I'm not a girl.
- ...and your dad is an angel.

21:16.025 --> 21:18.443
I mean, what a family!

21:18.819 --> 21:22.113
I'm just a dope
who died in a safe with a snorkel...

21:24.241 --> 21:27.619
who's only now realising
why that didn't work.

21:28.996 --> 21:30.497
You should be with someone better.

21:31.165 --> 21:32.373
I don't deserve you.

21:32.666 --> 21:35.376
Jason, you are all that I care about.

21:36.378 --> 21:40.632
Possibly because I did not have the capacity
to care about anything before you.

21:41.383 --> 21:42.217
I love you.

21:43.260 --> 21:47.013
Also, interesting side note,
I think I might hate things now, too.

21:47.389 --> 21:50.183
So far, it's genocide
and leggings as pants.

21:50.267 --> 21:51.392
This is nuts.

21:52.144 --> 21:54.020
Just weighing in over here.

21:54.104 --> 21:55.814
This is bonkers.

21:56.690 --> 21:57.565
You know...

21:58.234 --> 21:59.651
everything's falling apart.

21:59.735 --> 22:02.612
The only thing I can think to do
is to reboot you again, Janet.

22:02.696 --> 22:05.490
Why?
- It's the only thing I can think of to do

22:05.908 --> 22:07.075
to get rid of this glitch.

22:07.159 --> 22:08.910
Yo, who you calling a glitch?

22:08.994 --> 22:12.080
It means error, Jason,
which is what this is.

22:12.164 --> 22:15.917
Oh, really? Is it an error
to act unpredictably

22:16.001 --> 22:20.755
and behave in ways that run counter
to how you were programmed to behave?

22:20.840 --> 22:21.881
Yes.

22:22.383 --> 22:23.925
Now, you two sit tight.

22:24.468 --> 22:26.719
I'm gonna go murder Janet,
and I'll be right back.

22:28.097 --> 22:29.472
Look on the bright side.

22:30.182 --> 22:31.432
When you're rebooted

22:31.517 --> 22:34.018
I can teach you
all the Dorito flavours again.

22:34.395 --> 22:36.646
No. I'm not starting over.

22:37.147 --> 22:39.440
What if he reboots me,
and we fall out of love?

22:40.359 --> 22:41.860
We have to get out of here right now.

22:45.656 --> 22:46.823
Where do you suppose she is?

22:46.907 --> 22:48.157
I hope she's OK.

22:48.742 --> 22:51.911
You know, the more I work on her case,
the more I think she truly belongs here.

22:54.915 --> 22:57.917
Um, I'm sorry
that I haven't been able to say...

22:59.628 --> 23:02.005
what you want me to say,
because I... I do want to say it.

23:02.631 --> 23:03.715
What's holding you back?

23:03.799 --> 23:05.758
Honestly, my biggest fear
is just making sure

23:05.843 --> 23:07.552
that my motivation for saying it...

23:10.014 --> 23:11.097
Chidi?

23:15.811 --> 23:17.645
- Wow.
- How did she suddenly...?

23:17.730 --> 23:18.897
Her motivation changed.

23:18.981 --> 23:21.482
She couldn't earn enough points
by apologising to everyone here

23:21.567 --> 23:24.360
because she was only doing it
to earn enough points to stay here.

23:24.445 --> 23:25.653
But she did earn enough points

23:25.738 --> 23:27.989
which means she's decided not to stay here,
which means...

23:28.240 --> 23:29.115
That she's leaving.

23:33.537 --> 23:35.747
Oh, hey, Janet.
I was just about to call you

23:35.831 --> 23:39.375
to ask you to get me
a train to the Bad Place.

23:39.460 --> 23:42.295
Whoa, what?
- You have to be a good person to stay here

23:42.379 --> 23:45.006
and I can't become a good person
unless I leave.

23:45.090 --> 23:47.675
You don't belong here,
Jason doesn't belong here

23:48.052 --> 23:50.303
and now that I can think and feel,
I don't belong here either.

23:50.804 --> 23:51.888
Where are you going with this?

23:51.972 --> 23:55.892
There is a woman named Mindy St. Clair
who lives in a neutral zone by herself.

23:55.976 --> 23:58.478
It's neither a Good Place nor a Bad Place.

23:58.562 --> 24:01.522
A Medium Place?
Dude, that's where I belong.

24:01.607 --> 24:03.066
I've been saying that since day one.

24:03.150 --> 24:04.609
It's where Jason and I are going.

24:04.985 --> 24:06.819
Would you like to come
with us to Mindy's house?

24:06.904 --> 24:09.072
Yeah. Let's go hang with Mindy.
That sounds great.

24:09.156 --> 24:11.449
Love her, huge fan. Call the train.

24:11.533 --> 24:12.700
Look, there it is now.

24:15.412 --> 24:16.496
I did not call that train.

24:16.580 --> 24:20.124
That train belongs to Shawn,
the judge, who's coming here to judge you.

24:20.209 --> 24:22.210
Can you make that train
go to Mindy's house?

24:22.294 --> 24:25.004
Yep.
- Then we have to go. Right now.

24:25.089 --> 24:26.297
I just have to run home real quick

24:26.382 --> 24:27.966
and hit save on the Madden game
I was playing

24:28.050 --> 24:30.760
because Blake Bortles has, like,
300 yards passing in the first half...

24:56.787 --> 24:57.829
Shawn.

24:58.247 --> 24:59.414
Michael.

24:59.498 --> 25:00.915
Sorry I wasn't here to greet you.

25:01.000 --> 25:05.003
I, uh, had something I needed to tend to,
but it can wait. It can wait.

25:08.674 --> 25:10.216
OK, I've hacked into the mainframe.

25:11.593 --> 25:12.677
Kidding.

25:12.761 --> 25:15.888
I can't hack into the mainframe.
Technically, I am the mainframe.

25:15.973 --> 25:17.306
Would you just hurry up?

25:17.933 --> 25:20.184
I'm here to rule
on the fate of Fake Eleanor Shellstrop.

25:20.269 --> 25:21.102
Yes, yes.

25:21.186 --> 25:25.023
Um, I think we have a rock-solid case
for Fake Eleanor.

25:25.774 --> 25:28.026
I truly believe she's a good person.

25:28.527 --> 25:31.404
Are you sure?
Because I believe she's stealing my train.

25:32.948 --> 25:34.198
I'm sorry, Michael.

25:34.992 --> 25:35.950
Sorry, everyone.

25:41.206 --> 25:42.248
Well...

25:43.208 --> 25:44.500
not great for my case.
