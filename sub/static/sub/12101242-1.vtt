47:44.756 --> 47:46.555
That was fucking incredible.

47:46.555 --> 47:48.667
I don’t know why you’re so proud of that.

47:48.667 --> 47:53.331
You screamed like a baby goat
just fucking dying a long painful death.

47:59.954 --> 48:03.110
Remember how we used to
play fairies here?

48:03.110 --> 48:06.403
And you told me that there were druids
in the woods,

48:06.403 --> 48:10.582
And gnomes in the caves.
And we, like, left potions for them,

48:10.582 --> 48:12.787
And we cast spells and stuff?

48:14.000 --> 48:15.767
No.

48:16.322 --> 48:18.558
You don’t remember that?

48:23.293 --> 48:25.918
You are heartless.

48:26.713 --> 48:28.362
You see?

48:35.451 --> 48:37.905
It’s freezing.

48:46.266 --> 48:48.951
Fire fill my heart

48:49.203 --> 48:51.607
With a vital force

48:51.672 --> 48:53.896
Bring us light in the night

48:53.982 --> 48:57.972
And the warmth of an embrace

49:02.761 --> 49:07.272
Fire fill my heart

49:08.229 --> 49:11.925
With a vital force

49:12.861 --> 49:17.578
Bring us light in the night

49:19.389 --> 49:23.460
And the warmth of an embrace

49:23.795 --> 49:28.295
Fire fill my heart

49:28.911 --> 49:33.829
With a vital force

49:33.829 --> 49:33.950
With a vital force
Bring us light in the night

49:33.950 --> 49:38.445
Bring us light in the night

49:40.446 --> 49:44.745
And the warmth of an embrace

49:58.576 --> 50:00.801
Wait, Charlie!

50:01.649 --> 50:04.755
Come on! Let’s go!

51:49.629 --> 51:52.745
Ruby! Hey. Hey.

51:57.899 --> 52:01.399
I can’t! I can’t!

52:01.399 --> 52:03.884
We’re going to get through this.

52:03.884 --> 52:05.490
I promise you.

53:07.341 --> 53:10.873
Fire fill my heart

53:12.470 --> 53:15.880
With a vital force

53:17.210 --> 53:20.780
Bring us light tin the night

53:22.449 --> 53:25.850
And the warmth of your embrace

53:26.215 --> 53:29.149
Fire fill my heart

53:29.554 --> 53:33.230
With a vital force

53:33.620 --> 53:36.848
Bring us light in the night

53:37.795 --> 53:41.501
And the warmth of your embrace

53:41.501 --> 53:41.910
And the warmth of your embrace
Fire fill my heart

53:41.910 --> 53:44.972
Fire fill my heart

1:00:16.282 --> 1:00:18.240
Come on!

1:00:19.629 --> 1:00:22.395
Come on, come on!

1:00:26.355 --> 1:00:29.728
Yes, yes, yes!

1:02:42.737 --> 1:02:44.553
Don't be nervous.

1:02:44.749 --> 1:02:47.862
Nervous is not a good look
on such a pretty face.

1:02:50.144 --> 1:02:52.826
I've never done
anything like this before.

1:02:53.863 --> 1:02:55.736
Then be attentive.

1:02:56.497 --> 1:02:58.607
What are your ambitions?

1:02:58.607 --> 1:03:00.657
What have you done that has led you here?

1:03:00.964 --> 1:03:04.460
I want you to be honest with me, Evelyn.

1:03:06.130 --> 1:03:10.510
As I said on the phone,
I had to make some choices.

1:03:11.300 --> 1:03:12.580
It all felt so...

1:03:13.330 --> 1:03:14.858
Unreal.

1:03:15.598 --> 1:03:18.164
I want you to elaborate.

1:03:18.164 --> 1:03:18.490
I want you to elaborate.
When did you decide these were
choices you needed to make?

1:03:18.490 --> 1:03:21.509
When did you decide these were
choices you needed to make?

1:03:22.880 --> 1:03:24.297
Um...

1:03:26.177 --> 1:03:29.564
I guess it all started
with my sister, Delilah.

1:03:39.224 --> 1:03:41.590
Food smells good.

1:03:42.846 --> 1:03:44.891
Ev, you doin' okay?

1:03:46.459 --> 1:03:48.259
What's wrong?

1:03:49.500 --> 1:03:51.956
Nobody's here, it's like
they're afraid of her.

1:03:57.445 --> 1:04:00.357
We're here for you, okay?

1:05:29.454 --> 1:05:31.991
Ev, this is incredible.

1:05:42.794 --> 1:05:45.910
I knew it wasn't an accident.

1:05:46.151 --> 1:05:49.318
But it's kind of sick though, isn't it?

1:05:50.621 --> 1:05:52.278
But everybody liked it.

1:05:52.278 --> 1:05:54.170
They liked...

1:05:54.170 --> 1:05:55.367
They liked me.

1:05:57.788 --> 1:06:01.155
It's not normal, you understand?

1:06:01.505 --> 1:06:02.455
Yes.

1:06:05.224 --> 1:06:08.107
It was only supposed to
be a temporary solution.

1:06:09.907 --> 1:06:12.447
So of course you couldn't
keep mutilating yourself.

1:07:06.504 --> 1:07:08.684
Do you like it, the tomato sauce?

1:07:09.318 --> 1:07:10.635
Yeah, yeah.

1:07:10.635 --> 1:07:12.130
It was good.

1:07:13.877 --> 1:07:15.710
It was a new recipe.

1:07:17.216 --> 1:07:19.831
Isn't it just...tomatoes?

1:07:23.633 --> 1:07:25.555
Sorry, Ev, I was...

1:07:25.555 --> 1:07:27.154
I was kidding.

1:07:33.380 --> 1:07:35.659
That's the cake we had the other day.

1:07:35.659 --> 1:07:37.535
You know, the one everybody liked?

1:07:38.279 --> 1:07:39.472
Mmhmm.

1:07:40.503 --> 1:07:41.869
Yeah.

1:07:43.167 --> 1:07:47.990
Did you, uh, change something this time?

1:07:48.788 --> 1:07:50.789
Yes.

1:07:51.583 --> 1:07:52.589
It's good.

1:07:52.589 --> 1:07:55.808
No, it's good, it's just it tastes um...

1:07:56.375 --> 1:07:58.542
Just...it tastes a little different.

1:08:01.706 --> 1:08:03.674
I made it... different.

1:08:17.310 --> 1:08:19.460
What went wrong?

1:08:22.176 --> 1:08:24.176
I thought I knew.

1:08:24.176 --> 1:08:26.254
I mean, I did know but...

1:08:26.254 --> 1:08:28.309
But you needed to be sure.

1:08:28.975 --> 1:08:32.952
I thought everybody was just pretending,
because they felt sorry for me.

1:08:34.475 --> 1:08:36.459
What did you do about it?

1:08:39.718 --> 1:08:42.224
I have an item for an Evelyn.

1:08:42.224 --> 1:08:43.540
Yeah, that's me.

1:08:43.806 --> 1:08:45.540
I just need a signature.

1:08:54.971 --> 1:08:56.227
Paper cut.

1:08:56.227 --> 1:08:57.421
I'm fine.

1:08:58.771 --> 1:09:00.920
Afraid of a drop of blood?

1:09:04.933 --> 1:09:06.872
You killed him.

1:09:07.467 --> 1:09:08.950
No.

1:09:11.500 --> 1:09:13.433
Not at first.

1:11:08.347 --> 1:11:10.260
Are you an only child?

1:11:10.764 --> 1:11:11.934
Now?

1:11:14.166 --> 1:11:15.862
I mean, I guess.

1:11:16.612 --> 1:11:18.630
My sister...

1:11:19.915 --> 1:11:21.772
She killed people...

1:11:21.772 --> 1:11:23.311
And herself.

1:11:23.892 --> 1:11:25.393
But you're not like her.

1:11:27.812 --> 1:11:29.939
I never intended to be.

1:11:30.331 --> 1:11:33.161
Do you believe intentions
are all that matter?

1:11:33.559 --> 1:11:35.726
They're a good place to start.

1:11:38.955 --> 1:11:41.789
How did you find us?

1:12:15.936 --> 1:12:17.218
Hello?

1:12:19.575 --> 1:12:22.833
Your blood is not like anyone else's.

1:12:24.242 --> 1:12:26.580
How does that feel?

1:12:27.441 --> 1:12:29.523
It's like...

1:12:30.841 --> 1:12:32.841
It's like I'm the only thing that matters.

1:12:33.675 --> 1:12:36.753
It's all I want, to be
someone's everything.

1:12:39.401 --> 1:12:41.291
And Toby?

1:12:42.723 --> 1:12:45.350
We were never really that serious.

1:12:46.689 --> 1:12:51.114
Someone like you goes missing,
you're not just forgotten.

1:12:53.690 --> 1:12:56.369
You are so special.

1:12:58.315 --> 1:13:00.736
What will happen when it's over?

1:13:02.630 --> 1:13:05.109
Things beyond us, Evelyn.

1:13:05.491 --> 1:13:10.415
We indulge, you transcend.

1:14:13.017 --> 1:14:15.105
Are you vampires?

1:14:17.996 --> 1:14:20.684
Vampires don't exist, Evelyn.

1:14:23.088 --> 1:14:24.782
And what will I be?

1:14:25.480 --> 1:14:26.627
Desired.

1:14:29.535 --> 1:14:32.385
Everyone will want to be you.

1:15:43.934 --> 1:15:48.159
I've never seen something so beautiful.
