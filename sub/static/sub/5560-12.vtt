(Mayfair) Assistant Director Carter

00:04.034 --> 00:05.770
is missing, presumed dead.

00:05.772 --> 00:06.905
What?

00:06.907 --> 00:08.055
(gunshots)

00:10.494 --> 00:12.260
(Weller) We should probably
talk about last night.

00:12.262 --> 00:13.828
There's a park at the end of my street.

00:13.830 --> 00:15.263
Meet me there at 10:00.

00:15.265 --> 00:16.414
(Dr. Borden) We discussed setting

00:16.416 --> 00:18.833
clearer boundaries with Agent Weller.

00:18.835 --> 00:20.101
How's that been going?

00:23.974 --> 00:25.490
Good.

00:25.492 --> 00:28.910
They're scared of you...
and they should be.

00:28.912 --> 00:30.678
I have missions for you.

00:30.680 --> 00:32.080
(Jane) We do this on my terms.

00:32.082 --> 00:33.264
These are your terms.

00:33.266 --> 00:35.283
This is all your plan.

00:35.285 --> 00:36.968
And it's time to get started.

00:43.543 --> 00:46.294
So what now?

00:46.296 --> 00:50.448
Now...

00:50.450 --> 00:52.000
your first mission.

00:53.220 --> 00:54.435
What is that?

00:54.437 --> 00:57.489
It's an exact replica of Mayfair's pen.

00:57.491 --> 01:01.426
How do you know what
Mayfair's pen looks like?

01:01.428 --> 01:03.278
Do you have cameras in there?

01:03.280 --> 01:06.815
No, we... we have another way.

01:09.085 --> 01:10.652
I need you to swap 'em

01:10.654 --> 01:11.953
and bring me hers.

01:11.955 --> 01:13.771
So you wipe my memory,

01:13.773 --> 01:15.456
you tattoo my entire body,

01:15.458 --> 01:17.559
and then you send me to the FBI

01:17.561 --> 01:19.027
so I can steal a pen.

01:19.029 --> 01:22.847
(chuckles)

01:22.849 --> 01:23.882
What?

01:23.884 --> 01:27.535
You're still... you're still you.

01:28.772 --> 01:29.804
What is it?

01:29.806 --> 01:31.689
A bug? A tracker?

01:31.691 --> 01:33.458
Because I won't betray my team.

01:33.460 --> 01:35.460
It's not a betrayal, it's a pen.

01:35.462 --> 01:39.130
A regular pen.

01:39.132 --> 01:40.498
How do I know that you weren't

01:40.500 --> 01:42.717
holding a gun to my head during that video?

01:42.719 --> 01:45.220
I've never pointed a gun at you.

01:45.222 --> 01:46.738
I know better.

01:46.740 --> 01:49.324
And if you really thought
that, you wouldn't be here.

01:49.326 --> 01:51.025
You'd have sent your team.

01:51.027 --> 01:52.927
But you didn't...

01:52.929 --> 01:54.762
because, somehow...

01:54.764 --> 01:57.265
you know that you're not one of them,

01:57.267 --> 01:59.117
that you're just a cog in their machine.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.685
Welcome while useful,

02:00.687 --> 02:05.206

02:05.208 --> 02:07.675
What about the man at my safe house...

02:07.677 --> 02:08.860
with the beard?

02:12.933 --> 02:14.165
Was he with you?

02:14.167 --> 02:17.201
With us?

02:21.741 --> 02:23.374

The River Styx.

stimulates, steroids, and anesthetics.

11:59.080 --> 12:00.813
Even in low doses,

12:00.815 --> 12:02.632
the combination of these drugs
is massively debilitating.

12:04.252 --> 12:05.768
Well, that would explain his behavior.

12:05.770 --> 12:07.987
But it's not the volume that caught my eye.

12:07.989 --> 12:10.790
One of the drugs used was
Zeta Interacting Protein.

12:10.792 --> 12:12.292
Wait, like...

12:12.294 --> 12:13.593
Yes, exactly the same drug

12:13.595 --> 12:15.161
that was used to erase your memory.

12:21.266 --> 12:24.114
Charlie's body was overloaded
with a very complex cocktail.

12:24.116 --> 12:25.807
- And ZIP was part of it?
- Yes.

12:25.809 --> 12:27.132
So there's got to be a connection.

12:27.134 --> 12:29.329
Well, ZIP isn't a rare
drug, but until your case,

12:29.331 --> 12:31.231
I'd never seen it used in such high doses.

12:31.233 --> 12:33.050
So are the levels similar here?

12:33.052 --> 12:35.102
Well, not quite as high, but close.

12:35.104 --> 12:36.837
So the people that did this to Charlie

12:36.839 --> 12:39.106
could be the same people
that did this to Jane.

12:39.108 --> 12:41.241
<i>You did this to yourself.</i>

12:41.243 --> 12:45.245
<i>You... did this... to yourself.</i>

12:45.247 --> 12:48.048
(Dr. Borden) Maybe, but
there's also a possibility

12:48.050 --> 12:49.966
this might have nothing to do with her.

12:49.968 --> 12:52.119
Or it could have everything to do with her.

12:52.121 --> 12:53.320
So we got to find these people.

12:53.322 --> 12:54.921
What about these other drugs?

12:54.923 --> 12:56.323
Do they have any
legitimate medical purpose?

12:56.325 --> 12:58.058
Individually, yes.

12:58.060 --> 13:00.610
But with this combination and quantity,

13:00.612 --> 13:02.229
most patients would be comatose.

13:02.231 --> 13:04.197
So why not Charlie?

13:04.199 --> 13:05.966
Well, that's what's been baffling me.

13:05.968 --> 13:08.602
His epinephrine levels are
10 times the normal limit.

13:08.604 --> 13:10.871
His entire sympathetic system is surging.

13:10.873 --> 13:12.806
His heart rate, blood pressure,
they're out of control.

13:12.808 --> 13:15.208
Steroids to improve physical performance,

13:15.210 --> 13:17.878
ephedrine to sharpen mental acuity,

13:17.880 --> 13:21.381
and mood-altering drugs to dampen fear.

13:21.383 --> 13:24.634
This guy is in a constant
state of fight-or-flight.

13:24.636 --> 13:27.020
Someone's trying to build a better soldier.

13:28.457 --> 13:30.290
Our military has a history with this,

13:30.292 --> 13:32.576
using unwitting soldiers to test everything

13:32.578 --> 13:34.661
from LSD to chemical weapons.

13:34.663 --> 13:36.029
If they got Charlie,

13:36.031 --> 13:37.447
they could have the four other soldiers.

13:37.449 --> 13:38.482
Yeah, but how do we find them?

13:38.484 --> 13:40.117
If it is a military operation,

13:40.119 --> 13:42.068
the Pentagon isn't just
gonna tell us where they are.

13:42.070 --> 13:44.621
And our witness isn't
exactly a font of information.

13:44.623 --> 13:46.690
Charlie's ZIP levels
aren't as high as Jane's.

13:46.692 --> 13:48.742
He can start recovering
memories within a few weeks.

13:48.744 --> 13:50.060
We can't afford to wait that long.

13:50.062 --> 13:52.212
Familiar sights trigger memories for me.

13:52.214 --> 13:54.231
Charlie wants his mom.

13:54.233 --> 13:56.783
If we could get her here, maybe
more memories would come back.

13:56.785 --> 13:58.585
He might remember where he was being held.

13:58.587 --> 14:01.421
Let's track down Charlie's mother.

14:09.097 --> 14:11.898
Charlie?

14:12.818 --> 14:14.384
Oh, my God.

14:14.386 --> 14:16.102
(sobbing) It is you.

14:17.272 --> 14:20.307
<i>They told me you were dead.</i>

14:20.309 --> 14:22.459
<i>(sobbing)</i>

14:22.461 --> 14:24.678
<i>Oh... baby...</i>

14:26.815 --> 14:29.299
I... I thought I lost you.

14:29.301 --> 14:31.852
Mom, I-I'm sorry.

14:31.854 --> 14:36.790
I prayed for you every night.

14:36.792 --> 14:41.745
Oh, Charlie... where did you go?

14:41.747 --> 14:47.551
I was in hell, but I got out.

14:47.553 --> 14:49.853
I saw the face of God.

14:49.855 --> 14:54.357
Mom, he told me to go home to you.

14:55.285 --> 14:56.576
Oh, God.

14:56.578 --> 14:58.178
(sobbing)

15:00.732 --> 15:03.049
Her son killed three people

15:03.051 --> 15:05.235
and all she wants to do is hug him.

15:05.237 --> 15:07.254
She got him back.

15:09.758 --> 15:11.825
It's all she cares about.

15:20.686 --> 15:23.486
Why haven't you forgiven your father?

15:26.207 --> 15:28.592
You know, he didn't...

15:28.594 --> 15:32.546
that you were wrong about that night.

15:32.548 --> 15:34.180
It's more complicated than that.

15:34.182 --> 15:35.515
You always say that, but...

15:35.517 --> 15:37.584
Why? What's so complicated?

15:39.805 --> 15:41.821
He was a terrible father.

15:41.823 --> 15:46.610
He was distant. He was drunk.

15:48.163 --> 15:51.014
Me being wrong about one night
doesn't change any of that.

15:52.200 --> 15:55.335
But he's sick, right?

15:59.908 --> 16:03.226
Any progress on the other
soldiers listed on the tattoo?

16:03.228 --> 16:04.644
Uh, nothing yet.

16:04.646 --> 16:06.546
I cross-referenced where they trained,

16:06.548 --> 16:07.814
where they served, where they grew up.

16:07.816 --> 16:09.232
Keep digging.

16:09.234 --> 16:11.401
Whoever was experimenting
on Charlie is probably

16:11.403 --> 16:12.969
doing the same to the other four.

16:12.971 --> 16:14.537
We have to track them down.

16:14.539 --> 16:18.658
(keyboard clacking)

16:18.660 --> 16:21.378
You said you were gonna
take a leave of absence

16:21.380 --> 16:24.598
after we found David's killer.

16:24.600 --> 16:27.601
I know, I was.

16:27.603 --> 16:31.171
But then there was the
whole Pan-Asian 921 thing

16:31.173 --> 16:34.324
and then this...

16:34.326 --> 16:37.711
Things here just feel more important.

16:39.965 --> 16:42.148
I've been where you are,

16:42.150 --> 16:44.784
and I dealt with it in the exact same way.

16:44.786 --> 16:48.321
And it worked for a while.

16:48.323 --> 16:50.557
The longer you run from this,

16:50.559 --> 16:53.777
the more it will hurt when it catches you.

16:53.779 --> 16:57.364
And, trust me, it will catch you.

17:06.458 --> 17:07.857
I should get back to work.

17:15.083 --> 17:16.967
(Charlie) Uhh! Let me go!

17:16.969 --> 17:18.367
Please, don't let them take me!

17:18.369 --> 17:19.970
What the hell is going on?

17:19.972 --> 17:22.489
They're CID claiming that
they have jurisdiction.

17:22.491 --> 17:23.723
Special Agent Ken Thorpe,

17:23.724 --> 17:24.924
Army Criminal Investigation Command,

17:24.925 --> 17:26.358
and we do have jurisdiction.

17:26.361 --> 17:27.761
We're in the middle of an investigation.

17:27.762 --> 17:29.529
- He committed a federal crime.
- On Army land.

17:29.531 --> 17:30.697
The victims were Army, he's Army.

17:30.699 --> 17:32.499
You and your team need to stand down.

17:32.501 --> 17:35.685
We have reasons to believe
that that man has been subjected

17:35.687 --> 17:37.620
to inhumane medical experiments.

17:37.622 --> 17:39.723
After the Army had declared him dead.

17:39.725 --> 17:40.957
So you can understand why we're reluctant

17:40.959 --> 17:42.075
to hand him back to you.

17:42.077 --> 17:43.760
I don't know anything about that.

17:43.762 --> 17:46.346
- And you'd say if you did, right?
- Call your boss.

17:46.348 --> 17:47.881
Call my boss. Hell, call the president.

17:47.883 --> 17:49.065
They'll all tell you the same thing.

17:49.067 --> 17:50.433
This is my case.

17:53.488 --> 17:55.822
Let them go.

17:55.824 --> 17:56.906
You're just gonna let this happen?

17:56.908 --> 17:58.591
Stand down.

17:58.593 --> 18:00.727
Don't let them take me
back there... please.

18:09.158 --> 18:11.855
I found something linking all
the soldiers on Jane's tattoo.

18:11.857 --> 18:12.972
Did they know each other?

18:12.974 --> 18:14.574
Not while they were alive.

18:14.576 --> 18:17.794
All five were declared dead in IED attacks.

18:17.796 --> 18:19.029
And in every case,

18:19.031 --> 18:20.513
the first responders on the scene

18:20.515 --> 18:22.415
were the same private military contractor.

18:22.417 --> 18:23.566
Who?

18:24.920 --> 18:26.319
Northlake.

18:26.321 --> 18:27.937
Why'd it take this long
to make that connection?

18:27.939 --> 18:30.724
Contractors like this go out
of their way to be opaque.

18:30.726 --> 18:33.510
Each of the responders were
paid by separate entities.

18:33.512 --> 18:35.178
But Northlake controls all of them?

18:35.180 --> 18:37.597
They make it very hard to uncover, but yes.

18:37.599 --> 18:38.732
It could've taken hours
for the military M.E.s

18:38.734 --> 18:40.433
to arrive at the attack site.

18:40.435 --> 18:42.452
Northlake would've had access
to those bodies the entire time.

18:42.454 --> 18:44.370
So Northlake kidnapped these soldiers,

18:44.372 --> 18:45.972
faked their deaths.

18:45.974 --> 18:48.241
They're the ones responsible
for running these experiments.

18:48.243 --> 18:49.642
Well, it makes sense.

18:49.644 --> 18:51.261
Private military
contractors have the motive

18:51.263 --> 18:52.896
to develop these drugs for the mercenaries.

18:52.898 --> 18:54.597
Not the most morally scrupulous, either.

18:54.599 --> 18:56.449
Let's move.

19:00.856 --> 19:03.123
(chain clanking)

19:08.580 --> 19:11.164
(tires screeching)

19:21.543 --> 19:23.143
(beeping)

19:23.145 --> 19:24.294
(controller beeps)

19:25.168 --> 19:26.646
(gunshots)

19:28.100 --> 19:29.499
(Charlie) Leave me alone!

19:29.501 --> 19:31.718
Who are you? What do you want from me?

19:38.656 --> 19:40.820
All the CID agents were dead on the scene.

19:40.822 --> 19:43.270
- What about Charlie?
- He's missing.

19:43.272 --> 19:45.941
This attack was coordinated,
military-style precision,

19:45.943 --> 19:48.127
definitely Northlake's M.O.

19:48.129 --> 19:49.461
Do you think they'll kill him?

19:49.463 --> 19:50.813
No.

19:50.815 --> 19:51.881
They wanted him alive for a reason.

19:51.883 --> 19:53.499
Our best bet is to track down

19:53.501 --> 19:55.551
where they've been
conducting these experiments.

19:55.553 --> 19:57.286
Do we know anything yet
about where he was being held,

19:57.288 --> 19:58.604
outside of "hell"?

19:58.606 --> 20:00.139
That driver that picked up Charlie,

20:00.141 --> 20:01.574
where was that?

20:01.576 --> 20:03.792
Down the road from Fort
Beck at about 8:00 A.M.

20:03.794 --> 20:05.744
(Mayfair) Drop a pin in it.

20:05.746 --> 20:08.180
Didn't Borden's toxicology report

20:08.182 --> 20:10.649
narrow down the last
time Charlie was drugged?

20:10.651 --> 20:12.468
Yeah, at around 7:30 A.M.

20:12.470 --> 20:15.504
All right, so he's been on
the run for half an hour,

20:15.506 --> 20:17.940
could've covered four
to five miles at most.

20:20.044 --> 20:22.278
Didn't Charlie say he
swam across the River Styx

20:22.280 --> 20:23.429
after he escaped?

20:23.431 --> 20:24.947
He was drugged out of his mind.

20:24.949 --> 20:27.049
Yeah, but what if he swam across something?

20:27.051 --> 20:28.617
A real river.

20:28.619 --> 20:29.852
(Zapata) Well, that helps.

20:29.854 --> 20:31.153
It's still a lot of ground to cover.

20:31.155 --> 20:32.588
(Patterson) Hey, here's something.

20:32.590 --> 20:34.139
So the preliminary reports say,

20:34.141 --> 20:36.575
one of the gunman who
attacked Charlie's transport

20:36.577 --> 20:38.844
left a boot print with oil residue."

20:38.846 --> 20:40.329
Heating oil number six,

20:40.331 --> 20:42.481
which New York started phasing out in 2010.

20:42.483 --> 20:43.799
Wherever they held him,

20:43.801 --> 20:45.117
they must've had one
of those boilers there.

20:45.119 --> 20:46.802
The flames he saw.

20:46.804 --> 20:48.988
How many buildings still
use that heating oil?

20:48.990 --> 20:50.389
According to EPA records,

20:50.391 --> 20:52.241
in our radius, it's just five.

20:52.243 --> 20:54.260
It's enough to go on.

20:58.716 --> 21:01.734
(hammering and drilling)

21:05.022 --> 21:09.608
(heart monitor beeping)

21:11.329 --> 21:13.195
Charlie, I thought we lost you.

21:13.197 --> 21:15.681
(straining)

21:15.683 --> 21:17.349
Don't worry, we're leaving here soon.

21:17.351 --> 21:19.368
It'll all be over before you know it.

21:27.411 --> 21:28.560
First of our five buildings

21:28.562 --> 21:30.145
should be coming up in half a mile.

21:30.147 --> 21:31.614
How will we know what to look for?

21:31.616 --> 21:34.216
We won't... we have to
clear them one by one.

21:36.904 --> 21:39.655
Wait, Charlie said he saw the face of God

21:39.657 --> 21:41.056
when he came out.

21:41.058 --> 21:44.193
Hit the voice command button.

21:44.195 --> 21:45.511
(panel beeps)

21:45.513 --> 21:47.212
(computer) <i>Please say a command.</i>

21:47.214 --> 21:50.416
Destination, 912 Division Ave.

21:50.418 --> 21:52.151
The face of God is at 912 Division?

21:52.153 --> 21:54.169
Kinda.

21:57.341 --> 21:58.913
Face of God.

21:59.577 --> 22:01.393
Nice work, Tasha.

22:04.365 --> 22:06.582
That's one of our five buildings.

22:06.584 --> 22:08.651
Charlie would've had a view
of the church on his way out.

22:10.455 --> 22:11.537
Let's move.

22:11.539 --> 22:14.089
(church bells toll)

22:14.091 --> 22:16.475
(bell ringing)

22:20.414 --> 22:22.131
(man) You want to ring that bell,

22:22.133 --> 22:23.399
don't you, princess?

22:23.401 --> 22:25.300
We all know you want to quit.

22:25.302 --> 22:26.368
(grunts) No.

22:26.370 --> 22:28.020
We all know you gonna quit.

22:28.022 --> 22:33.359
So quit wasting our time
and ring that damn bell!

22:48.192 --> 22:52.261
(bell rings)

22:56.384 --> 22:57.466
Jane?

23:11.791 --> 23:12.965
This one's dead.

23:12.967 --> 23:14.116
Same here.

23:16.270 --> 23:19.722
Four soldiers. Five beds.

23:19.724 --> 23:22.524
They still have Charlie.

23:24.631 --> 23:27.312
(sirens, indistinct chatter)

23:27.314 --> 23:29.381
Northlake must've figured the heat was on.

23:29.383 --> 23:30.899
They left this place in a hurry.

23:30.901 --> 23:32.901
And destroyed all the evidence behind them.

23:32.903 --> 23:34.570
They didn't destroy everything.

23:34.572 --> 23:36.305
I recovered a partial video file

23:36.307 --> 23:38.006
off one of the damaged hard drives.

23:38.008 --> 23:40.459
They thought deleting them
would stop them from...

23:40.461 --> 23:42.294
If you want to destroy a hard drive,

23:42.296 --> 23:43.812
use a high-powered magnet or...

23:43.814 --> 23:45.114
All right, what'd you find?

23:48.502 --> 23:50.035
<i>Trial 42, subject three,</i>

23:50.037 --> 23:52.221
<i>Dr. Sparacino principal examiner.</i>

23:52.223 --> 23:54.690
<i>I'm attempting my latest variant.</i>

23:54.692 --> 23:57.826
<i>Adjusting lorazepam
levels to reduce seizures.</i>

24:01.899 --> 24:04.333
<i>Subject four's brain is the only one</i>

24:04.335 --> 24:07.803
<i>effectively processing
the epinephrine overload.</i>

24:07.805 --> 24:11.924
<i>Mild hallucinations seem
to be the only side effect.</i>

24:11.926 --> 24:13.926
<i>Further experimentation is needed</i>

24:13.928 --> 24:16.028
- <i>in order to explore this.</i>
- _

24:16.030 --> 24:18.347
Charlie was the only one
that it was working on.

24:18.349 --> 24:20.532
That's why they stole him
back and killed the others.

24:20.534 --> 24:22.017
(Weller) What do we know about that doctor?

24:22.019 --> 24:23.952
Doctor Lindsay Sparacino.

24:23.954 --> 24:25.354
Served two decades in the Army's

24:25.356 --> 24:26.722
advanced medical research department.

24:26.724 --> 24:28.123
Retired in '05.

24:28.125 --> 24:30.109
Nice, she's been keeping busy.

24:30.111 --> 24:32.461
But get this, the good
doctor emptied all her assets

24:32.463 --> 24:33.946
into an offshore account.

24:33.948 --> 24:35.547
She's getting ready to run.

24:35.549 --> 24:37.933
She could sell that formula
to any terrorist cell

24:37.935 --> 24:40.035
or rogue nation with an open checkbook.

24:40.037 --> 24:42.688
(Reade) And they'd have an army
full of engineered super soldiers.

24:42.690 --> 24:44.490
Only if it works.

24:44.492 --> 24:46.842
That video makes it look like
Charlie's biology is the key

24:46.844 --> 24:48.443
to unlocking the formula.

24:48.445 --> 24:50.846
But we need to get him back
before she goes underground.

24:50.848 --> 24:53.232
Let's put out a BOLO at
every airport and port

24:53.234 --> 24:54.466
within 100 miles.

24:54.468 --> 24:56.535
- (alert beeping)
- Hang on.

24:56.537 --> 24:58.103
I don't think she's leaving just yet.

24:58.105 --> 25:00.639
Her EZ-Pass just dinged
outside Brooklyn Battery Tunnel,

25:00.641 --> 25:02.424
going east on the BQE.

25:02.426 --> 25:04.610
She does rent a storage
unit about two miles away.

25:04.612 --> 25:07.412
She's probably got a stash
of passports and cash.

25:07.414 --> 25:09.565
Or another lab.

25:10.835 --> 25:12.284
Jane's right.

25:12.286 --> 25:13.852
Charlie processed this
cocktail differently,

25:13.854 --> 25:15.654
and the doctor needs to find out why.

25:15.656 --> 25:17.139
And the answers are probably buried deep

25:17.141 --> 25:18.574
in the synapses of his brain.

25:18.576 --> 25:20.125
What is she gonna do to him?

25:20.127 --> 25:22.805
Nothing that Charlie would live through.

25:27.065 --> 25:30.339
(distant sirens)

25:32.343 --> 25:34.593
(man struggling)

25:37.965 --> 25:39.465
Aren't we gonna put him all the way under?

25:39.467 --> 25:41.867
No... I need to monitor his brain activity

25:41.869 --> 25:42.935
and conscious responses.

25:42.937 --> 25:44.019
We don't have enough...

25:44.021 --> 25:45.538
he'll be dead within 10 minutes.

25:45.540 --> 25:46.639
That's enough time.

25:46.641 --> 25:47.940
We get this serum right,

25:47.942 --> 25:49.842
we change the face of modern warfare.

25:51.245 --> 25:54.814
(sirens wailing)

25:56.300 --> 25:59.668
Patterson says the unit
is 6-117, sixth floor.

25:59.670 --> 26:01.854
(heart monitor beeping, Charlie straining)

26:05.338 --> 26:07.076
(heart monitor beeping faster)

26:07.078 --> 26:09.795
It's okay, Charlie, it won't hurt for long.

26:14.051 --> 26:15.751
Reade, Zapata, go right.

26:15.753 --> 26:17.470
Jane, with me.

26:40.695 --> 26:42.394
(gunshots)

26:43.581 --> 26:45.598
(both grunting)

26:55.977 --> 26:57.710
(distant machine gun fire)

27:02.483 --> 27:05.150
Jane, on my six!

27:06.270 --> 27:07.453
Uhh!

27:11.509 --> 27:13.342
(cries out)

27:18.883 --> 27:19.965
Agh!

27:23.170 --> 27:24.236
(glass shatters)

27:32.213 --> 27:34.713
(gagging)

27:34.715 --> 27:36.565
(both grunting)

27:54.702 --> 27:55.718
(both grunt)

27:59.023 --> 28:01.640
(Charlie shouting, muffled)

28:08.349 --> 28:11.267
FBI! Put that down. Put it down!

28:11.269 --> 28:12.284
Walk towards me.

28:12.286 --> 28:13.352
Get over there.

28:13.354 --> 28:14.403
Hands on the wall.

28:15.423 --> 28:17.640
(machine gun fire)

28:22.163 --> 28:23.262
Ohh!

28:27.485 --> 28:29.285
It's okay, we're gonna get you safe.

28:29.287 --> 28:32.588
Who are you? What do you want with me?

28:33.708 --> 28:36.258
Oh, no. ZIP.

28:36.260 --> 28:37.326
They dosed him again.

28:37.328 --> 28:39.595
He can't remember us.

28:39.597 --> 28:40.813
No... Charlie, no!

28:41.966 --> 28:43.082
Jane!

28:44.268 --> 28:45.634
Come here, stay against that wall.

28:45.636 --> 28:48.053
Don't move.

28:50.558 --> 28:52.708
They're yours.

28:52.710 --> 28:54.677
Jane!

28:54.679 --> 28:56.504
- (Reade) Move.
- Turn around.

29:01.335 --> 29:03.602
Charlie, stop!

29:20.488 --> 29:21.754
Charlie, wait.

29:21.756 --> 29:23.155
Get away from me!

29:23.157 --> 29:25.207
Please.

29:25.209 --> 29:27.142
I'm gonna put this down.

29:27.144 --> 29:30.312
Please, I don't want to hurt you.

29:34.669 --> 29:35.701
It's okay.

29:35.703 --> 29:36.802
(growls)

29:36.804 --> 29:38.087
Charlie, please don't.

29:39.273 --> 29:41.657
(both grunting)

29:41.659 --> 29:42.992
Please, stop.

29:47.999 --> 29:49.281
Come on!

29:49.283 --> 29:51.316
Charlie, I don't want to hurt you.

29:53.004 --> 29:54.653
Charlie, stop!

30:06.083 --> 30:08.467
(Jane grunting)

30:09.704 --> 30:12.037
(grunting)

30:12.039 --> 30:13.222
(coughing)

30:14.442 --> 30:16.358
(pistol cocks)

30:16.360 --> 30:19.678
- No, please.
- (gunshot)

30:19.680 --> 30:21.313
(gasps)

30:23.434 --> 30:25.734
(panting)

30:25.736 --> 30:27.019
No.

30:34.078 --> 30:35.077
(indistinct chatter)

30:35.079 --> 30:37.563
(siren wails)

30:46.907 --> 30:47.890
You didn't have to...

30:47.892 --> 30:48.957
Yeah, I did.

30:50.644 --> 30:52.494
It could've been you in that body bag.

30:52.496 --> 30:54.413
He was innocent.

30:54.415 --> 30:56.148
He never wanted any of this.

30:56.150 --> 30:58.700
Someone puts my team
at risk or you at risk,

30:58.702 --> 31:00.335
I don't second guess.

31:00.337 --> 31:03.539
Things can be more
complicated than they seem.

31:03.541 --> 31:07.126
In this job there are good
guys and there are bad guys.

31:07.128 --> 31:08.727
It's not that complicated.

31:12.750 --> 31:14.767
You took some hits.

31:14.769 --> 31:16.368
Get checked out.

31:16.370 --> 31:17.920
We'll regroup later.

31:23.978 --> 31:27.262
(ambulance sirens wailing)

31:30.101 --> 31:34.253
You have no idea how much that
killed me to ring that bell.

31:34.255 --> 31:36.688
You played your part well.

31:36.690 --> 31:41.160
- Now what?
- Now, the real work begins.

31:41.162 --> 31:42.594
Welcome to Orion.

31:49.904 --> 31:51.770
(Jane) Who am I, Casey?

31:52.673 --> 31:54.606
(grunts)

31:54.608 --> 31:56.909
(whispers) Orion.

31:58.028 --> 31:59.845
Program's called Orion.

32:02.483 --> 32:05.217
Tell me... what's Orion?

32:05.219 --> 32:06.685
What did you say?

32:22.130 --> 32:23.531
You wanted to see me?

32:23.533 --> 32:25.282
The medics cleared you?

32:25.284 --> 32:28.369
Yeah, just a few bad bruises.

32:30.056 --> 32:32.073
What happened earlier today,

32:32.075 --> 32:35.393
you challenging me in front of Army CID,

32:35.395 --> 32:38.229
that was unacceptable.

32:38.231 --> 32:40.698
I'm sorry, I... I wasn't...

32:41.984 --> 32:43.934
I wasn't trying to challenge you.

32:43.936 --> 32:46.287
Just don't let it happen again.

32:50.076 --> 32:51.559
I wasn't trying to challenge you,

32:51.561 --> 32:54.678
but you shouldn't have
let them take Charlie.

32:54.680 --> 32:57.231
That wasn't my call to make
and it certainly wasn't yours.

32:57.233 --> 32:59.200
He was scared, helpless.

32:59.202 --> 33:01.419
You should've fought harder
to keep him in custody.

33:01.421 --> 33:04.972
Army CID had jurisdiction.

33:04.974 --> 33:06.524
It was out of my hands.

33:06.526 --> 33:08.526
If we hadn't let him go,
he might still be alive.

33:08.528 --> 33:10.144
(pen clicks, slams on the table)

33:10.146 --> 33:11.796
In this job,

33:11.798 --> 33:15.182
we all have to accept decisions
that we don't agree with.

33:15.184 --> 33:17.118
It's called chain of command.

33:18.805 --> 33:20.738
Ma'am, they're ready for you upstairs.

33:22.792 --> 33:25.843
And if you are gonna
remain part of this team,

33:25.845 --> 33:29.213
you're gonna have to learn
to function as part of a unit.

33:29.215 --> 33:30.731
Are we clear?

33:33.152 --> 33:34.218
Yeah.

33:37.373 --> 33:38.873
(door opens)

33:38.875 --> 33:40.474
(Oscar) You know that
you're not one of them...

33:40.476 --> 33:42.893
that you're just a cog in their machine.

34:11.873 --> 34:14.007
(blender whirring)

34:14.010 --> 34:15.159
(blender shuts off)

34:20.600 --> 34:21.815
Looks delicious.

34:21.818 --> 34:23.833
Tastes even better.

34:23.835 --> 34:25.569
(chuckling)

34:25.571 --> 34:26.637
Sarah says it's supposed to be good

34:26.639 --> 34:28.038
for my platelets or something.

34:28.040 --> 34:29.657
You ask me, it's like trying

34:29.659 --> 34:32.009
to stop a tank with a BB gun, but...

34:32.011 --> 34:33.944
you know your sister.

34:33.946 --> 34:35.179
Do you want a hand?

34:36.616 --> 34:40.467
(blender whirring)

34:44.757 --> 34:46.674
(blender shuts off)

34:48.127 --> 34:51.128
Do you know anything about
this guy Sarah's out with?

34:51.130 --> 34:53.264
Just that she won't tell me his name.

34:53.266 --> 34:55.282
Must be serious.

34:56.518 --> 34:57.618
(glasses clink)

34:57.620 --> 34:59.236
Sorry.

34:59.238 --> 35:02.273
(indistinct chatter)

35:02.275 --> 35:03.424
Hi.

35:06.546 --> 35:08.395
- (chuckling) Hi.
- Hey.

35:11.934 --> 35:14.268
- You look amazing.
- Thank you.

35:14.270 --> 35:17.238
The waitress's earrings
cost more than my car.

35:17.240 --> 35:20.024
Never mind her earrings, I like your car.

35:20.026 --> 35:22.576
It's... it's an antique.

35:22.578 --> 35:24.161
Mm-hmm.

35:24.163 --> 35:26.230
I got you your usual sugar drink.

35:26.232 --> 35:27.381
Thank you.

35:27.383 --> 35:28.365
(glasses clink)

35:28.367 --> 35:29.817
Cheers.

35:32.204 --> 35:33.804
Okay, I'm just gonna
come right out and say it.

35:33.806 --> 35:34.788
I missed you.

35:34.790 --> 35:36.807
I saw you two days ago.

35:36.809 --> 35:39.143
I can't miss you after two days?

35:39.145 --> 35:41.478
Well, you sure can, I
am pretty "miss-able."

35:41.480 --> 35:44.131
Oh, no, what happened to your face?

35:44.133 --> 35:45.466
Oh, it probably looks worse
than what it really is.

35:45.468 --> 35:46.834
I'm... I'm fine.

35:46.836 --> 35:48.869
My brother hit you when
you told him, didn't he?

35:48.871 --> 35:53.841
Well, it is from work,
but, no, he didn't hit me.

35:53.843 --> 35:55.743
I didn't tell him.

35:56.971 --> 35:58.345
- You wimp.
- I know, I know.

35:58.347 --> 35:59.980
I-I-I'll speak
to your brother.

35:59.982 --> 36:03.801
I just... trying to wait
until he's not so stressed.

36:03.803 --> 36:05.653
- You know?
- Mm-hmm, so never.

36:05.655 --> 36:06.637
(chuckling)

36:06.639 --> 36:07.905
Do you want me to do it?

36:07.907 --> 36:10.374
No, no, no, that's... look...

36:13.546 --> 36:15.379
It has to come from me.

36:15.381 --> 36:17.948
I just want to make sure
I do it right, you know?

36:27.360 --> 36:30.561
(laughing) Well, three...
three days we drove.

36:30.563 --> 36:31.996
I paid a fortune for those tickets.

36:31.998 --> 36:35.132
And the second your sister saw that guy

36:35.134 --> 36:39.069
in the... in the Pluto
costume, she burst into tears!

36:39.071 --> 36:42.206
Money well spent.

36:42.208 --> 36:43.674
(chuckling)

36:43.676 --> 36:44.842
(sighs)

36:44.844 --> 36:48.495
(chuckling continues)

36:48.497 --> 36:50.714
What really happened that night?

36:50.716 --> 36:53.550
The night that Taylor disappeared.

36:53.552 --> 36:55.152
Where were you?

36:57.523 --> 37:00.607
You left that dinner party for three hours.

37:00.609 --> 37:03.093
I volunteered for a booze run.

37:03.095 --> 37:06.730
I'd forgotten that the liquor stores...

37:06.732 --> 37:07.965
most of them weren't open on Sundays.

37:07.967 --> 37:09.316
Sundays, yeah, I know.

37:09.318 --> 37:10.934
So you had to drive halfway to Ohio.

37:10.936 --> 37:12.569
Yeah, I...

37:12.571 --> 37:13.554
I don't want the line that you fed everyone

37:13.556 --> 37:14.521
for 25 years, Dad.

37:14.523 --> 37:16.156
That's the truth.

37:26.268 --> 37:27.418
(sighs)

37:27.420 --> 37:29.570
Why were your shoes muddy?

37:35.428 --> 37:38.545
You thought I was asleep.

37:38.547 --> 37:39.747
I wasn't.

37:41.434 --> 37:45.135
I saw you hosing off your
shoes when you got home.

37:45.137 --> 37:46.870
I didn't...

37:46.872 --> 37:49.106
(sighs)

37:49.108 --> 37:50.391
She's alive, Kurt.

37:50.393 --> 37:52.776
Then why did you lie about where you were?

37:52.778 --> 37:55.195
Because I was trying to kill myself!

38:00.619 --> 38:01.702
What?

38:01.704 --> 38:03.921
I was depressed for a long time.

38:03.923 --> 38:06.907
And I had thought about it
before and I just couldn't.

38:06.909 --> 38:08.592
And finally, I'd just had enough,

38:08.594 --> 38:10.360
and I drove to the Susquehanna,

38:10.362 --> 38:14.131
and I walked... I walked in.

38:14.133 --> 38:18.669
And then I just couldn't shake this image.

38:18.671 --> 38:20.054
What image?

38:20.056 --> 38:24.007
You and Sarah... at my funeral.

38:24.009 --> 38:26.693
What... what you'd be wearing...

38:26.695 --> 38:29.229
where you'd be sitting.

38:29.231 --> 38:33.183
So I just, uh... got back in the car

38:33.185 --> 38:34.418
and drove home.

38:36.188 --> 38:37.337
With muddy shoes.

38:37.339 --> 38:38.705
Yes.

38:41.026 --> 38:43.911
After all these years...

38:43.913 --> 38:45.262
why didn't you tell anyone?

38:45.264 --> 38:47.648
Who was gonna believe me?

38:47.650 --> 38:50.234
Me! Sarah!

38:50.236 --> 38:52.002
Mom!

38:52.004 --> 38:54.054
(sobbing)

38:56.692 --> 38:58.792
I was so ashamed.

38:58.794 --> 39:00.310
I had almost...

39:00.312 --> 39:03.180
(sobbing) And...

39:03.182 --> 39:06.416
Your... and your mother
never would've understood me.

39:06.418 --> 39:08.318
Sarah, she never believed
what people said anyway.

39:08.320 --> 39:10.087
But you, I wanted you...

39:10.089 --> 39:14.007
I wanted you as far away
from me as I could get you.

39:14.009 --> 39:15.793
(whispers) Why?

39:15.795 --> 39:19.738
I was so full of rage.

39:20.432 --> 39:24.084
I was so full of...

39:24.086 --> 39:30.774
And I didn't want you to turn out like me.

39:30.776 --> 39:33.177
(sobbing) I'm so sorry, Kurt.

39:33.179 --> 39:35.946
I'm... I'm... you know...

39:39.418 --> 39:41.418
(sobbing) I'm so sorry, Kurt.

39:41.420 --> 39:43.587
Shh.

39:43.589 --> 39:44.905
(sobbing) I'm so...

39:46.425 --> 39:48.475
(muttering)

39:58.888 --> 40:01.188
(whispering) Ah, God.

40:08.380 --> 40:09.646
Good work.

40:09.648 --> 40:11.381
How do you know it's hers?

40:11.383 --> 40:12.866
If they were really the same...

40:12.868 --> 40:13.967
I know.

40:15.154 --> 40:18.622
And I know why you gave me this mission.

40:18.624 --> 40:20.090
You do?

40:20.092 --> 40:23.427
It was a test of my loyalty, and I passed.

40:24.997 --> 40:29.950
I held up my end, and now
you owe me some answers.

40:29.952 --> 40:31.101
The bearded man...

40:31.103 --> 40:33.003
You can't trust them.

40:33.005 --> 40:35.022
Yes, he was with us.

40:36.408 --> 40:38.308
He told me not to trust "them."

40:38.310 --> 40:39.409
Who did he mean?

40:39.411 --> 40:41.178
The FBI.

40:42.331 --> 40:45.132
Why would... who shot him?

40:45.134 --> 40:46.683
Ask me another question.

40:46.685 --> 40:48.285
I can't tell you that yet.

40:48.287 --> 40:50.804
What about the people who gave
ZIP to those dead soldiers?

40:50.806 --> 40:52.072
Were they with us, too?

40:52.074 --> 40:55.192
No. We found out about the research

40:55.194 --> 40:57.311
and disapproved of it.

40:57.313 --> 41:00.647
But we saw an application
that was useful to us.

41:04.820 --> 41:06.303
What is Orion?

41:10.442 --> 41:12.209
You already got enough answers tonight.

41:12.211 --> 41:15.996
No... this isn't a game to me.

41:15.998 --> 41:17.881
What is Orion?

41:19.818 --> 41:22.653
Orion...

41:22.655 --> 41:24.421
is where you died.
