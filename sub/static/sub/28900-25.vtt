micro machine?
-Yeah, you figure out

00:12.179 --> 00:14.179

big Peanut Profile column about?

00:14.215 --> 00:16.181
Huh, Levi? Huh? Huh?

00:16.784 --> 00:18.317
There are a few possibilities,

00:18.352 --> 00:21.053
but I can't find anyone
with that pizazz.

00:37.204 --> 00:39.171
for their big contest to become
their next influencer?

00:39.206 --> 00:42.307
I really want to say yes.

00:42.343 --> 00:45.310
Well, I won! Yes, Psy-Key
picked me to sponsor!

00:45.346 --> 00:48.213
I've already got
500 new followers, and it's
only been like 10 minutes!

00:48.249 --> 00:49.381
Yo, that's amazing!

00:49.417 --> 00:51.517
Their limited edition
shoes are fire.

00:51.552 --> 00:54.486
I prefer their
floral sports line.

00:57.224 --> 00:59.491
What? It breathes
more freely than cotton.

01:01.495 --> 01:03.262
What? I'm a tastemaker.

01:03.798 --> 01:06.498
The best part is Psy-Key
is all about giving back.

01:06.534 --> 01:08.200
So, for every item you buy,

01:08.235 --> 01:10.402
they donate the same item
to a country in need.

01:10.438 --> 01:13.439

for a company that's
ethically on point.

01:13.474 --> 01:16.208

20:16.616 --> 20:19.550
-You're right.
-You know what?

20:19.586 --> 20:23.154
Nia believed Psy-Key
was doing good.

20:23.189 --> 20:26.390
So, we're going to do
what they didn't.

20:26.426 --> 20:29.327
We're gonna donate all the swag
Psy-Key gave us to charity.

20:29.362 --> 20:32.096
We are? I-I mean,
that's what's up.

20:34.234 --> 20:35.366
I'll miss you.

20:36.302 --> 20:38.569
-Book, I love that idea.
-Okay.

20:38.605 --> 20:41.572
Um, so post photos of what
you're donating to charity,

20:41.608 --> 20:43.407
whether it's Psy-Key's swag

20:43.443 --> 20:45.243
or just something you
don't need anymore.

20:45.278 --> 20:46.611
And Psy-Key, it's not too late

20:46.646 --> 20:49.180
to fulfill your promise
to donate to charity.

20:49.215 --> 20:52.516
Everyone, post about your
donations and tag Psy-Key!

20:52.552 --> 20:54.385
Read this one.

20:55.321 --> 20:58.256

inspiring." (chuckles)

20:58.291 --> 21:01.158
That's really sweet, but we're

21:02.128 --> 21:03.327
Bye, guys!

21:04.364 --> 21:06.464
-(chuckles)
-Thank you guys for defending me

21:06.499 --> 21:08.299
and for coming up
with that idea.

21:08.334 --> 21:10.268
Well, I had a vision
of you donating,

21:10.303 --> 21:12.536
so I was like,
we should donate.

21:14.274 --> 21:16.474
Wow, your vision came in handy!

21:16.509 --> 21:18.142
That's happened, never.

21:19.178 --> 21:22.213
Nia, we've got a new angle
for your Peanut Profile.

21:22.782 --> 21:25.549
Levi, I think I'm gonna stay
out of the press for a while.

21:25.585 --> 21:28.185
You've inspired so many people.

21:33.359 --> 21:34.525
(singsongy):
You're welcome!

21:36.396 --> 21:39.597
Oh. Thank you, guys.
(chuckles)

21:39.632 --> 21:41.265
This feels good.

21:41.301 --> 21:44.201
My shoe game has taken
a step back, though.

21:44.237 --> 21:46.337

Oh! Who told
you that?

That's right because
sometimes you gotta brag

22:02.488 --> 22:04.188
when you do something special.

22:04.223 --> 22:07.191
Oh! Well, then Nia should
start bragging, huh?

22:07.226 --> 22:09.493
With that new sponsorship
from a conscious company?

22:09.529 --> 22:11.128
Thanks, Aunt Chels.

they're not kicks.
