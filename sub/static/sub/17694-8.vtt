WEBVTT

00:03.437 --> 00:06.939
You really take it seriously
selling chocolates for charity.

00:06.941 --> 00:09.675
Well, the profits go directly
to putting inner-city kids

00:09.677 --> 00:11.310
on the road
to prosperity.

00:11.312 --> 00:13.178
The old Hershey highway.

00:13.180 --> 00:14.646
You can be
my first customer.

00:14.648 --> 00:17.316
Steve,
maybe you don't realize,

00:17.318 --> 00:18.984
I, uh --

00:18.986 --> 00:20.719
I don't have any money.

00:20.721 --> 00:24.623
Your father kind of controls
the money.

00:24.625 --> 00:29.461
I carry a brick in my purse
so I feel like I have something.

00:29.463 --> 00:32.031
And I had to steal
the brick.

00:32.033 --> 00:34.233
Oh, God, I have nothing.

00:35.169 --> 00:36.802
Welp, I got a long day of sales
ahead of me.

00:36.804 --> 00:38.203
(chuckles)

00:38.205 --> 00:40.239
Why don't you just, uh,
let yourself out

00:40.241 --> 00:43.142
after you get
a little nap-a-roo?

00:47.681 --> 00:51.717
Now to turn chocolates
into change -- not coins.

00:51.719 --> 00:53.652
We're not feeding
any parking meters here.

00:53.654 --> 00:57.389
No, we're change-ing
people's lives.

00:57.391 --> 00:58.957
(chuckles)

01:00.161 --> 01:02.928
My chocolates!
Who ate my chocolates?!

01:03.697 --> 01:06.098
I don't know,
but I'm gonna find out.

01:06.100 --> 01:07.699
Roger, stop right there!

01:07.701 --> 01:09.201
We're losing
valuable time.

01:09.203 --> 01:11.003
When it comes
to missing chocolate,

01:11.005 --> 01:13.072
the first 24 hours are
the most important.

01:13.074 --> 01:15.007
Roger,
those were for charity!

01:15.009 --> 01:16.175
Steve, don't yell.

01:16.177 --> 01:17.776
Chocolate gives me
migraines.

01:17.778 --> 01:19.912
By the way,
looking good in that suit.

01:19.914 --> 01:20.946
Yeah? Thanks, man.

01:20.948 --> 01:22.214
Wait, wait, wait.
No!

01:22.216 --> 01:23.682
Why am I even arguing
with you?

01:23.684 --> 01:25.551
You don't know anything
about charity.

01:25.553 --> 01:27.553
You don't have a good bone
in your body.

01:27.555 --> 01:29.488
Ha! I don't even have bones,
you idiot.

01:30.791 --> 01:32.357
All cartilage, baby.

01:32.359 --> 01:34.259
I'm not talking about
your actual skeleton, Roger.

01:34.261 --> 01:36.395
Steve, why are we even
talking about this?

01:36.397 --> 01:37.596
Let's just kiss.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.398
Cut it out.
What the heck, Steve?

01:39.400 --> 01:41.700
You come down
in your best little boy's suit

01:41.702 --> 01:43.802
and expect me not to get
a raging cartilager?

01:43.804 --> 01:45.637
All you ever think about
is yourself.

01:45.639 --> 01:48.307
You've never lifted a finger
to help a person in your life.

01:48.309 --> 01:49.975
You are selfish.

01:49.977 --> 01:52.211
Lifted a fi--

01:52.213 --> 01:53.579
Self-- Ohh!

01:53.581 --> 01:56.115
I've been called
a lot of things, Steve --

01:56.117 --> 01:57.883
a loser, a knob,
a turd burglar.

01:57.885 --> 01:59.651
You know
what a turd burglar is?

01:59.653 --> 02:01.453
It's somebody
who steals turds.

02:01.455 --> 02:03.388
But I am not
what you just...

02:03.390 --> 02:04.590
What did you call me?

02:04.592 --> 02:06.058
Selfish.
That's the one!

02:06.060 --> 02:07.826
(sobbing)

02:09.263 --> 02:12.664
I'm the one who called him
a turd burglar, but it's true.

02:12.666 --> 02:15.067
I saw him take one
that wasn't his.

02:17.738 --> 02:20.806
¶ Good morning, U.S.A. ¶

02:20.808 --> 02:24.243
¶ I got a feelin' that
it's gonna be a wonderful day ¶

02:24.245 --> 02:27.346
¶ The sun in the sky
has a smile on his face ¶

02:27.348 --> 02:31.650
¶ And he's shinin' a salute
to the American race ¶

02:33.521 --> 02:36.955
¶ Oh, boy, it's swell to say ¶

02:36.957 --> 02:39.525
¶ Good -- ¶
¶ Good morning, U.S.A. ¶

02:39.527 --> 02:42.127
Aah!

02:42.129 --> 02:45.164
¶ Good morning, U.S.A. ¶

02:47.668 --> 02:49.301
Let me get this straight.

02:49.303 --> 02:50.936
You don't have the money,

02:50.938 --> 02:53.205
and you don't have
the chocolates.

02:53.207 --> 02:54.973
That's, um -- That --
That -- That's right.

02:54.975 --> 02:56.708
That -- That --
That's the -- the situation.

02:56.710 --> 02:58.810
Oh, okay, then.
Everything's cool.

02:58.812 --> 03:01.380
We'll just chalk it up
as a misunderstanding.

03:01.382 --> 03:03.482
If everything's cool,
then --

03:03.484 --> 03:05.150
Sit your ass down,
Smith!

03:05.152 --> 03:06.885
You stole from a charity.

03:06.887 --> 03:09.655
You know who
the charity benefits? Me!

03:09.657 --> 03:10.989
Well, I thought it was
for inner-city --

03:10.991 --> 03:13.158
Where the hell
do you think I live?

03:13.160 --> 03:14.860
Smith,
you're a bad apple.

03:14.862 --> 03:17.663
And one bad apple
spoils the barrel.

03:17.665 --> 03:21.200
Good news is we have a whole
barrel of bad apples here.

03:21.202 --> 03:22.534
Oh, God.

03:22.536 --> 03:25.404
You're sending me
to the at-risk class?!

03:25.406 --> 03:28.006
That'll look terrible
on my college applications.

03:28.008 --> 03:29.975
Oh, don't worry, Steve.

03:29.977 --> 03:33.579
Murdered little boys
don't go to college.

03:36.050 --> 03:37.883
Francine,
where's the newspaper?

03:37.885 --> 03:39.985
Oh, the paper
hasn't come before noon

03:39.987 --> 03:42.321
since that old man
started doing the route.

03:42.323 --> 03:43.922
Oh, yeah, he's so old.

03:43.924 --> 03:46.191
I mean, why's he doing
a paper route? He's so old.

03:46.193 --> 03:48.860
It's terrible that he still has
to work at his age.

03:48.862 --> 03:51.230
That's not gonna happen to us,
will it, Stan?

03:51.232 --> 03:53.665
Nope, I've got our retirement
all planned out.

03:53.667 --> 03:57.369
401(k)s, Roth I.R.A.s,
even personalized canoes.

03:57.371 --> 03:59.071
Why do we need canoes?

03:59.073 --> 04:01.206
To send our dead bodies
down the river.

04:01.208 --> 04:02.874
We're having
Viking funerals.

04:02.876 --> 04:04.576
I'm sure
we've discussed this.

04:04.578 --> 04:07.546
Canoes,
oil-soaked rags, Klaus.

04:07.548 --> 04:09.581
I'm gonna burn you all.

04:09.583 --> 04:11.250
(flame hisses)

04:11.252 --> 04:14.419
Stan's ready.
I'm -- I'm almost ready.

04:14.421 --> 04:16.555
It doesn't sound like
you're ready, Mr. "S."

04:16.557 --> 04:18.790
You didn't even mention
you're retirement home.

04:18.792 --> 04:19.891
They're all the same.

04:19.893 --> 04:21.927
No,
they're super-different.

04:21.929 --> 04:25.731
I play bridge all over town,
and the quality varies widely.

04:25.733 --> 04:27.899
We should
look into this Stan.

04:27.901 --> 04:29.534
I don't want to end up
at some home

04:29.536 --> 04:30.936
where I have to hide
my brick.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.237
Fine!
We can look into it.

04:32.239 --> 04:33.238
(bell chimes)

04:33.240 --> 04:35.274
Finally.

04:35.276 --> 04:38.310
(wheezing)

04:43.651 --> 04:46.051
KLAUS:
Burn in hell, Dilbert!

04:53.060 --> 04:54.293
This is -- This is weird.

04:54.295 --> 04:55.927
I've never been
up here before.

04:55.929 --> 04:57.596
Th-things are different.
(siren wailing in distance)

04:57.598 --> 05:00.565
Yeah, this floor went to hell
after the mill closed.

05:00.567 --> 05:04.002
(indistinct conversations)
and here's your new home.

05:04.838 --> 05:07.439
Check me out right now.
(laughs)

05:07.441 --> 05:09.274
Society's given up
on these kids.

05:09.276 --> 05:11.243
The school's given up
on these kids.

05:11.245 --> 05:13.645
Their own children have given up
on these kids.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.747
They're looking.
They're looking at us.

05:15.749 --> 05:17.649
Y-Y-Y-You think
they can read lips?

05:17.651 --> 05:19.084
They can't read books!

05:20.521 --> 05:22.921
They're a bunch of dumbasses
with no future.

05:22.923 --> 05:24.523
(gasps)
There's no glass.

05:24.525 --> 05:27.526
Fresh meat! Ha-ha!

05:27.528 --> 05:30.062
Lewis gets away again!

05:31.131 --> 05:32.798
Hey, where are my shoes?

05:32.800 --> 05:33.999
Up there, fool.

05:35.602 --> 05:38.203
Who put them up there?

05:38.205 --> 05:39.705
You've got a lot to learn
about how it works in here,

05:39.707 --> 05:41.306
little man.

05:41.308 --> 05:43.842
But if there's one thing
we don't do in here, it's learn.

05:43.844 --> 05:45.444
What?
Don't you have a teacher?

05:45.446 --> 05:48.180
Teacher?
We got a new teacher every week.

05:48.182 --> 05:50.282
They come in here.
We threaten them.

05:50.284 --> 05:52.517
Then we go to their houses
and threaten their families.

05:52.519 --> 05:54.386
Then they quit on us.

05:54.388 --> 05:57.389
(crying)
everybody quits on us.

05:57.391 --> 06:00.459
Wow. Seems like you guys need
some real help.

06:00.461 --> 06:03.795
Did someone say, "Lifting
a finger to help others"?

06:03.797 --> 06:04.896
Oh, no.

06:04.898 --> 06:06.365
Everyone,
cheeks to the seats.

06:06.367 --> 06:07.733
That means ass in the chairs.

06:09.403 --> 06:12.070
My name is Mr. Deliver.

06:14.375 --> 06:16.074
I know what you're thinking.

06:16.076 --> 06:18.043
Teacher probably shouldn't talk
to his students this way,

06:18.045 --> 06:21.847
but have any of your teachers
ever talked to you<i> this</i> way?

06:21.849 --> 06:24.483
I am not going to quit on you
because I know

06:24.485 --> 06:25.917
everyone in this class

06:25.919 --> 06:28.320
has potential
to achieve something great.

06:28.322 --> 06:30.489
And I know the game's stacked
against you.

06:30.491 --> 06:33.325
Even the classroom floor
appears to be an uphill battle.

06:35.362 --> 06:38.163
Oh, yeah, this class is at risk,
all right.

06:38.165 --> 06:41.533
At risk of learning.

06:41.535 --> 06:44.269
My ride's here.

06:44.271 --> 06:46.605
(groans)

06:46.607 --> 06:49.574
Whoa,
this is a different chair.

06:55.048 --> 06:59.084
The theater has a long and
fabled history of educating...

07:00.454 --> 07:03.655
ALL: Ooh!
(hip-hop music plays)

07:04.758 --> 07:06.291
Hmm. Jay-Z?
No.

07:06.293 --> 07:09.194
You know
who the original Jay-Z is?

07:09.196 --> 07:12.030
William Shakespeare.
Pfft!

07:12.032 --> 07:14.032
Whitey, throw me a beat.
No.

07:14.034 --> 07:16.368
(rapping) ¶ In fair Verona,
where we lay our scene ¶

07:16.370 --> 07:18.403
¶ A guy named Romeo,
a sexy teen ¶

07:18.405 --> 07:19.905
(blows)
¶ Remix ¶

07:19.907 --> 07:22.240
(imitates record playing
in reverse)

07:22.242 --> 07:24.543
¶ A sexy teen,
a sexy teen ¶

07:24.545 --> 07:26.545
¶ A s-s-s-s-s-s-s-sexy teen ¶

07:26.547 --> 07:29.114
Nope. No.
You and me. Outside now.

07:29.116 --> 07:32.751
Anyway, Romeo's a super-hot teen
trying to bang a pre-teen.

07:32.753 --> 07:34.886
Whitey, go ahead and rap them
through the rest of Act One.

07:34.888 --> 07:36.254
No.

07:36.256 --> 07:37.889
Steve, I've noticed
you're falling behind

07:37.891 --> 07:39.090
the other students.

07:39.092 --> 07:40.492
I didn't want to
embarrass you.

07:40.494 --> 07:41.927
That's why I brought you
out in the hallway.

07:41.929 --> 07:43.795
What?!
I-I-I brought you out here!

07:43.797 --> 07:45.664
Here comes the anger.
Let it out.

07:45.666 --> 07:47.666
I'll be your punching bag
all day.

07:47.668 --> 07:49.167
I see right through you.

07:49.169 --> 07:51.236
You're just here to show me
that you're not selfish.

07:51.238 --> 07:53.972
Wait, a-are you talking about
that conversation earlier

07:53.974 --> 07:55.807
where you slaughtered
my feelings?

07:55.809 --> 07:56.942
Made me feel this big?

07:56.944 --> 07:58.243
I'd forgotten about that.

07:58.245 --> 07:59.611
You're not a real teacher.

07:59.613 --> 08:01.746
This is just your
Time Warner cable guy

08:01.748 --> 08:03.815
re-purposed
after he committed suicide.

08:03.817 --> 08:08.153
Wrong. Mr. Deliver also has
a mole somewhere on his body.

08:08.155 --> 08:10.655
Don't you dare
try to find it.

08:10.657 --> 08:12.824
I want you to leave.

08:12.826 --> 08:15.327
You can't help these kids.
You don't even want to.

08:15.329 --> 08:17.028
You just want to
prove me wrong.

08:17.030 --> 08:18.163
So we both agree.

08:18.165 --> 08:19.498
This would
prove you wrong.

08:19.500 --> 08:20.665
It's not gonna matter.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.367
I don't even
need to do anything

08:22.369 --> 08:24.469
because these poor,
disadvantaged youths

08:24.471 --> 08:25.704
are animals,

08:25.706 --> 08:27.372
and they'll send you
running for the hills.

08:27.374 --> 08:28.807
I'm not going anywhere.

08:28.809 --> 08:29.975
(bell rings)

08:29.977 --> 08:31.843
Recess!
I'm going to recess!

08:32.880 --> 08:34.846
(laughs)

08:37.351 --> 08:39.150
Ah, the lobby.

08:39.152 --> 08:41.453
This'll be
the edge of my universe.

08:41.455 --> 08:44.055
I'll be able to sit right here
and watch Steve park

08:44.057 --> 08:46.057
and sit in his car
for a few minutes

08:46.059 --> 08:48.426
as he works up the courage
to come inside.

08:52.232 --> 08:53.331
Dad, what are you doing?

08:53.333 --> 08:54.833
I'm checking it out.

08:54.835 --> 08:56.201
If I'm gonna spend
the rest of my life here,

08:56.203 --> 08:57.702
I'd better try
one night first.

08:57.704 --> 08:59.337
Ooh, I'll stay, too.

08:59.339 --> 09:01.573
Remember what we have to do
the first night at a new home.

09:01.575 --> 09:04.342
I wish, but I want to make this
as realistic as possible.

09:04.344 --> 09:06.378
And when I get old enough
to live here,

09:06.380 --> 09:08.380
I won't even be able
to get hard to pee.

09:08.382 --> 09:09.981
You do that, Mr. "S"?

09:09.983 --> 09:11.216
Damn right, I do.

09:11.218 --> 09:12.384
Use it or lose it.

09:14.821 --> 09:18.657
(spray can hissing, tattoo
needle buzzing, drums playing)

09:21.695 --> 09:23.328
Yo, look,
teach already quit.

09:23.330 --> 09:24.763
He's not even trying.

09:24.765 --> 09:27.399
He's just staring
at that pigeon coop carpet.

09:27.401 --> 09:29.601
Damn it!
Why you trippin', teach?

09:29.603 --> 09:31.503
Why ain't you trippin',
Tiglet?

09:31.505 --> 09:34.272
These fat-cat journalists
saying 9 out of 10 of you

09:34.274 --> 09:36.141
will end up dead
or in prison.

09:37.744 --> 09:40.245
Well, here's what I think
of this.

09:44.251 --> 09:49.554
Dead, in prison, dead, dead,
dead, prison, prison, prison.

09:49.556 --> 09:50.922
Guess you make it.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.290
Looks like you're wrong, teach,

09:52.292 --> 09:53.725
'cause I'm gonna kill him.

09:53.727 --> 09:55.460
And that's why
<i> you</i> go to prison.

09:55.462 --> 09:57.529
ALL: Ohh!

09:57.531 --> 09:59.030
You're dead, teach!

10:05.072 --> 10:07.472
Whoa!
What were you, teach?

10:07.474 --> 10:08.773
Army? Marines?

10:08.775 --> 10:10.475
Army? I wish.

10:10.477 --> 10:12.077
I was in the shit.

10:12.079 --> 10:14.279
Janet Jackson's
"Rhythm Nation" tour.

10:14.281 --> 10:16.414
ALL: Wow!

10:16.416 --> 10:17.882
Damn.

10:17.884 --> 10:19.985
So what if this guy
used to know how to dance.

10:19.987 --> 10:21.453
He's a crummy teacher.

10:21.455 --> 10:22.887
ROGER:<i> Used</i> to know?

10:23.924 --> 10:25.557
ALL: Uh-oh!

10:26.493 --> 10:28.093
Give us a countdown!

10:28.095 --> 10:30.729
Four, three, two, one.

10:30.731 --> 10:34.132
(Janet Jackson's
"Rhythm Nation" plays)

10:40.140 --> 10:41.840
Nice try, teach.

10:41.842 --> 10:44.709
You're not gonna win us over
with this, right, guys?

10:46.513 --> 10:48.613
¶ With music by our side ¶

10:48.615 --> 10:51.349
¶ To break the color lines ¶

10:51.351 --> 10:52.684
¶ Let's work together ¶

10:52.686 --> 10:55.153
¶ To improve our way of life ¶

10:55.155 --> 10:57.322
¶ Join voices in protest ¶

10:57.324 --> 10:59.691
¶ To social injustice ¶

10:59.693 --> 11:03.862
¶ A generation full of courage,
come forth with me ¶

11:03.864 --> 11:06.197
Still not teaching them
anything.

11:06.199 --> 11:08.433
I taught them
how to count down from four.

11:08.435 --> 11:10.535
ALL: Whoa!

11:10.537 --> 11:11.803
Class dismissed.

11:11.805 --> 11:13.204
It's 9:15!

11:13.206 --> 11:15.340
Stop using numbers
we haven't got to yet.

11:15.342 --> 11:17.676
(indistinct shouting)

11:17.678 --> 11:20.011
You've got to fire
Mr. Deliver!

11:20.013 --> 11:22.547
Look who it is --
Mr. No Money, No Chocolate,

11:22.549 --> 11:24.616
telling me
how to run my business.

11:24.618 --> 11:25.850
Oh, hey, Steve.

11:25.852 --> 11:27.218
Principal Lewis,
this is the boy

11:27.220 --> 11:28.887
with anger issues
I was telling you about.

11:28.889 --> 11:30.188
But don't expel him.

11:30.190 --> 11:33.658
Give me a chance
to give him a chance.

11:33.660 --> 11:37.062
There's no way this guy's
qualified to teach those kids.

11:37.064 --> 11:38.963
Well,
he did go to Harvard.

11:38.965 --> 11:40.031
No, he didn't.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.833
Then how'd I get
this sweatshirt?

11:41.835 --> 11:43.668
How'd he get the sweatshirt,
Steve?

11:43.670 --> 11:45.236
Wha--
are you really asking?

11:45.238 --> 11:47.072
A sweatshirt
doesn't mean anything!

11:47.074 --> 11:48.840
You calling me a fraud?

11:48.842 --> 11:51.876
Saying I didn't graduate
from F.U.B.U.?

12:03.356 --> 12:06.357
(gasps)
Oh, God, did I slip up?

12:06.359 --> 12:07.726
Wait a minute.

12:07.728 --> 12:09.427
Vodka?
Whiskey?

12:09.429 --> 12:11.996
These aren't mine.
I'm a rum man.

12:11.998 --> 12:14.833
But let's see who<i> did</i> slip up.

12:14.835 --> 12:16.201
Hmm.

12:16.203 --> 12:18.269
Ahh! Yeah!

12:18.271 --> 12:20.739
(glass shatters)
Rum's the only thing
that gets my engine going!

12:20.741 --> 12:23.608
Rum!
Rum-rum-Rum-Rum-Rum-Rum-Rum!

12:23.610 --> 12:26.544
Rum!
Rum-rum-Rum-Rum-Rum-Rum-Rum!

12:26.546 --> 12:28.012
Rum!
Rum-rum-Rum-Rum-Rum!

12:28.014 --> 12:29.013
(imitates brakes screeching)

12:29.015 --> 12:30.348
Oh, this is bad.

12:30.350 --> 12:33.451
Looks like Harvard's
got a habit.

12:33.453 --> 12:34.519
Jackpot!

12:34.521 --> 12:35.920
Hmm.

12:35.922 --> 12:38.423
We can't have a drunk teacher
around here.

12:38.425 --> 12:42.560
But a perfectly buzzed
principal's good for everybody.

12:42.562 --> 12:44.095
(gulping)

12:47.801 --> 12:49.400
So, how was it, last night?

12:49.402 --> 12:51.269
(slurring speech)
Terrible.

12:51.271 --> 12:53.538
We still have
a lot of dogs to kill.

12:53.540 --> 12:55.607
What?
I'm not gonna say it again.

12:55.609 --> 12:57.442
They took my feet.

12:57.444 --> 13:02.280
Oh, no. Oh, no.

13:02.282 --> 13:03.615
Oh --

13:03.617 --> 13:04.816
What?!

13:04.818 --> 13:06.484
I've seen this
too many times.

13:06.486 --> 13:09.821
When people are put in a home,
they just go downhill so fast.

13:09.823 --> 13:11.156
Not this fast.

13:11.158 --> 13:12.757
Dad,
did they medicate you?

13:12.759 --> 13:15.126
We didn't give him anything
he didn't ask for.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.662
Which pills
would you like today, Stan?

13:17.664 --> 13:19.297
Red, green, blue?

13:19.299 --> 13:21.900
Rainbow! Rainbow!

13:21.902 --> 13:23.401
(gulps)

13:23.403 --> 13:25.670
I don't know
what you've done to my husband,

13:25.672 --> 13:27.605
but we're taking him home
right now.

13:27.607 --> 13:30.842
You can't take him anywhere
if he doesn't want to go.

13:30.844 --> 13:33.845
And you don't want to leave
our happy wittle home,

13:33.847 --> 13:34.979
do you, Stanny?

13:34.981 --> 13:37.282
I love you,
Nurse Jocelyn!

13:37.284 --> 13:39.617
Baby dirty.

13:39.619 --> 13:42.487
This is ridiculous.
He is coming with us.

13:42.489 --> 13:45.990
I mean,
after you...take care of...

13:45.992 --> 13:47.592
You heard him.
Baby dirty.

13:47.594 --> 13:49.861
Orderlies!

13:49.863 --> 13:51.462
(groans)
Don't worry, Dad.

13:51.464 --> 13:53.264
We're gonna get you
out of this.

13:53.266 --> 13:55.366
We are gonna sic Legal Zoom
on your ass!

13:55.368 --> 13:56.835
They're the best.

13:56.837 --> 13:58.603
They did our paperwork
when we got married.

13:58.605 --> 14:01.005
Actually, babe, there was
a little hiccup there.

14:01.007 --> 14:03.041
I'm not totally sure
we're married,

14:03.043 --> 14:05.877
but we're definitely licensed
to import rare birds.

14:08.448 --> 14:10.381
All right,
so the North is the Bloods

14:10.383 --> 14:11.783
and the South is the Crips.

14:11.785 --> 14:15.820
So that means Abe Lincoln
is Huge Omar!

14:15.822 --> 14:17.655
And Fort Sumter
was like when Kenny's mom

14:17.657 --> 14:19.190
shot his stepdad
in the dick.

14:19.192 --> 14:20.892
Which would mean...?

14:20.894 --> 14:24.629
That even if the war
didn't start out about slavery,

14:24.631 --> 14:26.965
Lincoln's
emancipation proclamation

14:26.967 --> 14:28.399
made it about slavery.

14:28.401 --> 14:31.669
Ricky,
that sounds right to me.

14:31.671 --> 14:34.005
-Whoo!
-Yeah! All right, Ricky!

14:34.007 --> 14:35.707
Stop teaching this class!

14:35.709 --> 14:38.042
I found your desk
full of alcohol!

14:38.044 --> 14:40.411
Then I dug deeper,
found your DUIs,

14:40.413 --> 14:42.380
your drunk
and disorderlies.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.983
What?! That's impossible!
I was framed!

14:44.985 --> 14:46.451
Get out of my school!

14:48.421 --> 14:51.155
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo,
you can't take him.

14:51.157 --> 14:53.691
He the first person
to ever get through to us.

14:53.693 --> 14:56.394
Kids, don't.
You can't fight the system.

14:56.396 --> 14:58.062
Remember that.

14:58.064 --> 15:00.231
(class jeering)

15:00.233 --> 15:01.733
-Let the teach teach!
-(crying)

15:01.735 --> 15:03.601
I don't know why
everybody's so upset.

15:03.603 --> 15:06.271
Sounds like we dodged a bullet
with this creep.

15:06.273 --> 15:09.774
He quit on us!
Teach quit on us!

15:09.776 --> 15:15.179
From now on, the only one
who quits on Ricky is Ricky!

15:16.549 --> 15:17.749
Ricky got shot!

15:17.751 --> 15:20.251
Ricky joined a gang
and got shot!

15:20.253 --> 15:21.386
(all gasp)

15:21.388 --> 15:22.921
This is bull, man!

15:22.923 --> 15:25.690
This would have never happened
if teach was here!

15:25.692 --> 15:29.360
(crying)
He was only 24!

15:29.362 --> 15:30.662
Damn.

15:34.768 --> 15:37.035
We've heard
a lot about Ricky.

15:37.037 --> 15:39.570
But I don't think
you could talk about Ricky

15:39.572 --> 15:41.639
without talking about
Mr. Deliver.

15:41.641 --> 15:44.409
He was helping Ricky
with his college applications.

15:44.411 --> 15:46.077
He was helping all of us.

15:46.079 --> 15:48.947
Whitey -- He drove you
to your mom's parole hearings.

15:48.949 --> 15:51.449
Yoyo, he paid your tab
at planned parenthood.

15:51.451 --> 15:54.552
And, Sara, he was always
rubbing your shoulders.

15:54.554 --> 15:56.321
Like, a lot.

16:02.262 --> 16:03.728
Maybe he did care.

16:03.730 --> 16:06.764
Ricky will live on
on his Facebook page

16:06.766 --> 16:08.967
and is survived
by his low-riding bicycle

16:08.969 --> 16:11.302
and his stolen Xbox.

16:13.807 --> 16:14.973
Stop right there!

16:14.975 --> 16:16.674
I've got our paralegal,
Rajeet,

16:16.676 --> 16:18.810
live-chatting with us
from Hyderabad.

16:18.812 --> 16:21.412
Technically,
I am not a full paralegal.

16:21.414 --> 16:23.581
And perhaps
an unnecessary furtherance --

16:23.583 --> 16:25.350
Look,
I don't have time for this.

16:25.352 --> 16:26.851
You can take him.

16:26.853 --> 16:28.519
He just needs to sign
his release papers.

16:28.521 --> 16:32.023
Mr. Smith, do you think
you can write your full name

16:32.025 --> 16:34.425
with this big marker-oo?

16:36.363 --> 16:37.595
There. All set.

16:37.597 --> 16:39.364
You can have your father,

16:39.366 --> 16:42.266
and I'll just keep
all of his assets.

16:42.268 --> 16:45.770
Boom!
Big money Jocelyn!

16:45.772 --> 16:47.672
All his assets?

16:47.674 --> 16:52.043
Then we're just left with...
my brick!

16:52.045 --> 16:53.945
Orderlies!

16:57.150 --> 16:58.649
I need some help, Jeff!

16:58.651 --> 17:00.518
Got it, babe!

17:00.520 --> 17:03.021
The key
to the drug locker!

17:03.023 --> 17:04.122
We did it!

17:05.558 --> 17:07.058
Enough!

17:07.060 --> 17:09.460
If only you could
see yourselves right now.

17:09.462 --> 17:12.163
Dad, I thought you were
all zonked out on pills.

17:12.165 --> 17:15.266
They tried, but I had
my C.I.A. cheek pocket in.

17:16.803 --> 17:19.170
Yep, this was one
of my famous tests.

17:19.172 --> 17:20.405
Oh, of course.

17:20.407 --> 17:21.739
He loves those.

17:21.741 --> 17:22.840
Always has.

17:22.842 --> 17:24.509
And you all failed.

17:24.511 --> 17:26.077
I'm not the one who has to be
ready for retirement.

17:26.079 --> 17:28.012
I'll be senile.

17:28.014 --> 17:30.581
You're the chicken heads
who need to be ready.
And you're not.

17:30.583 --> 17:33.584
You're the chicken head
'cause these documents are real.

17:33.586 --> 17:35.686
Everything's mine --

17:35.688 --> 17:39.690
the 401(k)s, the Roth I.R.A.s,
the canoes.

17:39.692 --> 17:41.325
Please, nurse, you must --

17:41.327 --> 17:44.395
you must tell me this is
one of your famous tests!

17:44.397 --> 17:45.730
Not even.

17:48.268 --> 17:50.501
Bull's-eye!
Ha-ha!

17:50.503 --> 17:52.937
Or should I say fish-eye?

17:53.940 --> 17:55.239
Okay, bull's-eye!

17:55.241 --> 17:57.642
It was clearly
the crowd favorite.

18:00.180 --> 18:02.080
(slurps)

18:02.082 --> 18:03.448
Mr. Deliver?

18:03.450 --> 18:05.550
Come on, Steve.
I'm not a teacher anymore.

18:05.552 --> 18:07.285
You want
a cup of noodles?

18:07.287 --> 18:08.286
Hot Pocket?

18:08.288 --> 18:09.754
I got all the sad foods.

18:09.756 --> 18:12.223
Look,
I'm here to say I'm sorry.

18:12.225 --> 18:14.192
I was so focused
on getting you fired

18:14.194 --> 18:16.427
I didn't realize
how much you were helping.

18:16.429 --> 18:18.629
Actually, I was just trying
to prove you wrong.

18:18.631 --> 18:20.231
I didn't care
about those kids.

18:20.233 --> 18:22.467
Yes, you did.
I saw you at the funeral.

18:22.469 --> 18:24.569
So I went to the funeral.
Big deal.

18:24.571 --> 18:26.604
I was their teacher,
and I walked out on them.

18:26.606 --> 18:29.073
I took all their field trip
money and bought Hot Pockets.

18:29.075 --> 18:30.541
They're better off
without me.

18:30.543 --> 18:33.211
I brought some people
who might disagree.

18:33.213 --> 18:41.486
¶ We are a part
of the rhythm nation ¶

18:44.257 --> 18:46.791
(Rapping) ¶ Let me teach y'all
about the number pi ¶

18:46.793 --> 18:49.427
¶ 3.14125 ¶

18:49.429 --> 18:51.762
¶ I changed the numbers
so it would rhyme ¶

18:51.764 --> 18:55.233
(laughter)

18:56.069 --> 18:58.603
what in the hot-and-holy hell
is going on in here?!

18:58.605 --> 18:59.971
No, no, no, it's cool.
It's cool.

18:59.973 --> 19:01.506
They had a vigil.
They asked me back.

19:01.508 --> 19:02.807
I said yes.

19:03.977 --> 19:06.144
It doesn't matter
if your students want you back.

19:06.146 --> 19:07.445
<i> I</i> fired you.

19:07.447 --> 19:09.347
You're a drunk
with a criminal record.

19:09.349 --> 19:12.350
Stop it!
Mr. Deliver isn't a bad guy.

19:12.352 --> 19:13.851
<i> I</i> am.

19:13.853 --> 19:16.154
I...framed him.

19:16.156 --> 19:18.422
Planted the alcohol,
hacked the state records.

19:18.424 --> 19:21.159
The only thing I know he's done
for sure is turd-burgling.

19:21.161 --> 19:24.028
And that should be treated
as an illness, not a crime.

19:24.030 --> 19:25.596
Wait a minute.

19:25.598 --> 19:28.866
You added DUIs
to this man's record?

19:28.868 --> 19:32.303
Can you, by any chance,<i> remove</i>
them from a person's record?

19:32.305 --> 19:33.604
I guess.

19:33.606 --> 19:35.306
Congratulations, Smith!

19:35.308 --> 19:37.708
You're back
in the smart class.

19:37.710 --> 19:40.611
After we stop by
the computer lab for a sec.

19:40.613 --> 19:43.447
And, you --
I don't care what you do.

19:43.449 --> 19:44.949
I'm going to teach!

19:44.951 --> 19:46.717
Like I said, don't care.

19:46.719 --> 19:48.219
But I do.

19:49.222 --> 19:51.556
You're so tense.

19:59.332 --> 20:01.365
Wh-What are you doing?

20:01.367 --> 20:03.067
Just loading up
on school property.

20:03.069 --> 20:05.136
But w-where's Whitey and Yoyo
and everybody?

20:05.138 --> 20:06.537
I got them
to join the Army.

20:06.539 --> 20:09.073
What?
b-but they're not all 18.

20:09.075 --> 20:11.576
They don't have to be
for the Chinese Army.

20:11.578 --> 20:14.178
My friend Chuen-Wei pays me
for every recruit

20:14.180 --> 20:15.880
in "World of Warcraft"
gold.

20:15.882 --> 20:18.216
And one of these days,
I'm gonna get into that game.

20:18.218 --> 20:19.650
Sounds super-cool.

20:19.652 --> 20:22.220
God, I'd love to escape
to a fantasy world.

20:22.222 --> 20:23.721
The real world's so dark.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.022
Did you hear
about that guy

20:25.024 --> 20:26.824
who sold his students
to the Chinese Army?

20:26.826 --> 20:28.526
It's like I can't even turn on
the news anymore.

20:28.528 --> 20:30.094
I can't believe you,
Roger.

20:30.096 --> 20:32.163
I can't believe
how helpful<i> you</i> were, Steve.

20:32.165 --> 20:33.764
I didn't think
it was gonna work,

20:33.766 --> 20:35.866
but then you got me fired,
got Ricky killed,

20:35.868 --> 20:38.035
and got all my students
to beg me to come back.

20:38.037 --> 20:40.338
After that,
they were putty in my hands.

20:40.340 --> 20:42.940
Oh, my God.
I helped you do this.

20:42.942 --> 20:45.376
What? You got them
out of the inner city.

20:45.378 --> 20:48.045
And you got the boot off
principal Lewis' car.

20:48.047 --> 20:49.547
So you've done
a lot of good.

20:49.549 --> 20:52.416
(siren wailing)

20:55.021 --> 20:57.955
Smith!
Meet me in the computer lab!

20:59.225 --> 21:02.226
(horn blaring)

21:02.228 --> 21:04.195
Bye!
Have a beautiful time!
