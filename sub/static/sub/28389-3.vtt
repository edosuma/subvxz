00:39.960 --> 00:41.925
Kalimera.

00:41.960 --> 00:43.960
Kalimera, Miss Durrells.

00:44.960 --> 00:48.925
I don't think you have met my wife,
Dimitra.

00:48.960 --> 00:50.605
No.

00:50.640 --> 00:54.965
No, I have er... seen you
in the distance.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.125
How nice to finally meet you.

00:58.160 --> 00:59.925
Ah, you speak English.

00:59.960 --> 01:02.925
Spiros taught me. He loves the English.

01:02.960 --> 01:05.640
And I love the Greeks.

01:07.960 --> 01:12.925
Thank you for letting us see so much
of Spiros since we lived here.

01:12.960 --> 01:14.925
Thank you for paying him.

01:14.960 --> 01:16.960
Oh, he means much more to us than that.

01:18.960 --> 01:19.925
Well, we must let you go.

01:19.960 --> 01:22.925
Yes, I'm just buying for a picnic.

01:22.960 --> 01:24.960
So that's nice.

01:28.960 --> 01:29.965
You must come along.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.925
Anyway...

01:31.960 --> 01:34.925
Oh, thank you. We will.

01:34.960 --> 01:36.000
When?

02:25.960 --> 02:28.445
Another top-notch lunch
at the Durrell guesthouse.

02:28.480 --> 02:29.925
You may applaud.

02:37.480 --> 02:38.925
No lunch for me...

02:38.960 --> 02:41.925
Luga... Er, what is it?

02:41.960 --> 02:43.925
ALL: Retzia.

02:43.960 --> 02:45.925
I tell you every day.

02:45.960 --> 02:48.925
How am I supposed to remember
a name like Luga, er...

02:48.960 --> 02:50.925
ALL: Retzia.

02:50.960 --> 02:53.960
As an aide-memoire, it rhymes with...

02:56.000 --> 02:59.960
I shall call you... Jill.

03:02.480 --> 03:05.925
- Kalimera.
- Ah, Kalimera.

03:05.960 --> 03:07.960
OWL SCREECHES

03:13.960 --> 03:15.960
Er...

03:21.960 --> 03:22.925
Yes.

03:22.960 --> 03:24.925
Lawrence Durrell,

03:24.960 --> 03:27.445
Tasos Koskinas. The White House.

03:27.480 --> 03:28.925
Kalami!

03:28.960 --> 03:30.925
And Miss Margo Durrell,

03:30.960 --> 03:33.925
C/O Geoffrey and Prudence, England!

03:33.960 --> 03:35.960
England!

04:15.960 --> 04:17.959
- Morning, Miss.
- Morning.

04:24.960 --> 04:25.925
Argh!

04:25.960 --> 04:29.285
Arghh!

04:29.320 --> 04:32.320
Sodding, ruddy argh!

04:35.960 --> 04:38.925
- Hello.
- Hello.

04:38.960 --> 04:39.925
Gerald Durrell?

04:39.960 --> 04:40.965
Yes. How can I help?

04:41.000 --> 04:42.960
I have this for you.

04:51.800 --> 04:54.925
Pogona vitticeps. Wonderful.

04:54.960 --> 04:56.925
I like how lizards
can amputate their tail

04:56.960 --> 04:58.285
to shake off a predator.

04:58.320 --> 05:00.925
And the detached tail keeps on wiggling

05:00.960 --> 05:02.925
to confuse the other animal.

05:02.960 --> 05:04.925
Why did you bring him to me?

05:04.960 --> 05:06.925
You love animals. People tell me.

05:06.960 --> 05:08.925
Keep.

05:08.960 --> 05:10.765
No.

05:10.800 --> 05:11.925
No, you keep.

05:11.960 --> 05:14.925
Find out all about him,
show all your friends,

05:14.960 --> 05:16.925
and then let him go.

05:16.960 --> 05:17.925
I like them here for a while,

05:17.960 --> 05:19.960
but they're better off under the sky.

05:27.320 --> 05:30.925
♪ Hold your hand out, naughty boy

05:30.960 --> 05:34.925
♪ Hold your hand out, naughty boy! ♪

05:34.960 --> 05:37.960
Though SOME are better kept indoors.

05:52.960 --> 05:54.925
Hello, Auntie. Uncle.

05:54.960 --> 05:57.445
What?

05:57.480 --> 05:58.925
Did you not get my letter?

05:58.960 --> 06:01.125
No. What did it say?

06:01.160 --> 06:02.965
That I was coming to stay.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.925
I don't really know anyone else
in England

06:05.960 --> 06:08.960
now Aunt Hermione's died.
I haven't been here since I was 15.

06:09.960 --> 06:11.925
Sorry, have you got a full house?

06:11.960 --> 06:12.925
No.

06:12.960 --> 06:15.925
But it'll take a massive amount
of organising.

06:15.960 --> 06:18.800
I can go to London, if you'd prefer.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.960
No, you'd better come in.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.960
Great.

06:29.960 --> 06:31.965
It's a bit of a surprise, that's all.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.925
We're creatures of habit.

06:33.960 --> 06:35.925
I've often thought that without habit,

06:35.960 --> 06:38.960
Prue and I would scurry around
like headless chickens.

06:47.960 --> 06:50.480
It's like a tiny museum.

06:51.960 --> 06:53.960
Oh, sorry, that was probably rude.

06:54.960 --> 06:56.925
Why have you left Greece?

06:56.960 --> 06:59.925
- Is it because it's abroad?
- No.

06:59.960 --> 07:01.320
I want to find myself.

07:03.960 --> 07:05.925
I'm sorry. What, dear?

07:05.960 --> 07:07.925
I suppose I would like to learn
to be confident

07:07.960 --> 07:08.925
by being more normal.

07:08.960 --> 07:10.925
- Good.
- That's the ticket.

07:10.960 --> 07:12.925
Not that being normal is everything.

07:12.960 --> 07:14.965
- Well, I think it is.
- Yes.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.925
How's your mother?

07:16.960 --> 07:20.125
We enjoyed seeing her last year
in London.

07:20.160 --> 07:23.925
Well, not exactly 'enjoyed'.

07:23.960 --> 07:25.925
No.

07:25.960 --> 07:27.960
Not 'enjoyed'.

07:35.960 --> 07:37.925
We're sailing up the coast on Saturday,

07:37.960 --> 07:38.925
to visit Larry, and have a picnic.

07:38.960 --> 07:40.925
Be careful.

07:40.960 --> 07:44.960
The sea is a grave made of water.

07:46.960 --> 07:48.960
I'd love to read your dictionary
definitions.

07:50.960 --> 07:52.925
Hey, come with us.

07:52.960 --> 07:54.960
You know, not to work, but as a guest.

07:56.960 --> 07:57.925
Me?

07:57.960 --> 08:00.960
Yeah, well, after all these years
here, you're family now.

08:19.480 --> 08:20.925
Should I go and talk to her?

08:20.960 --> 08:21.960
Yes.

08:42.960 --> 08:44.925
I know. I hate shopping, too.

08:44.960 --> 08:46.960
No.

08:47.960 --> 08:49.960
I just met Spiros' wife
for the first time.

08:51.960 --> 08:52.925
I was in a shop.

08:52.960 --> 08:55.925
And she came in, with Spiros.

08:55.960 --> 08:57.925
Four years without meeting,

08:57.960 --> 08:59.960
and now she starts going shopping!

09:02.960 --> 09:03.925
What did you say?

09:03.960 --> 09:06.765
I invited her and Spiros on our picnic,

09:06.800 --> 09:07.925
and she said yes.

09:07.960 --> 09:08.925
What?

09:08.960 --> 09:09.965
Why?!

09:10.000 --> 09:12.925
I was being polite and friendly.

09:15.960 --> 09:18.800
Well, she obviously wants
to get a proper look at you.

09:19.640 --> 09:21.925
You and Spiros aren't talking,
but want to.

09:21.960 --> 09:24.800
This is actually good.

09:25.960 --> 09:28.925
No, Leslie. It's actually bad.

09:28.960 --> 09:31.925
It'll be awkward, and painful.

09:31.960 --> 09:33.925
And Dimitra will turn up
with her trump cards,

09:33.960 --> 09:35.925
her children.

09:35.960 --> 09:37.925
Not literally. They're away, in Athens.

09:37.960 --> 09:40.925
And her sultry Greekness.

09:40.960 --> 09:45.960
And above all, her unattainable,
quietly-lovely husband.

09:48.160 --> 09:52.925
Well, I'll respect them
as a married couple,

09:52.960 --> 09:54.925
we'll have a nice day,

09:54.960 --> 09:57.925
I won't compare us, or judge her,
nor she me,

09:57.960 --> 10:00.960
or interfere in any way.

10:18.960 --> 10:20.925
What's your favourite sandwich?

10:20.960 --> 10:22.925
What a super day in prospect.

10:22.960 --> 10:25.925
I've brought my swimming costume.

10:25.960 --> 10:28.480
I have quite an impressive
cannonball in my arsenal.

10:32.960 --> 10:34.925
Right.

10:34.960 --> 10:36.925
Everything's fine. Everyone relax.

10:36.960 --> 10:38.960
Nothing strange or unusual happening.

10:42.960 --> 10:44.765
Hello.

10:44.800 --> 10:45.925
Spiros!

10:45.960 --> 10:48.960
Dimitra, this is Leslie Durrell.

10:51.960 --> 10:53.925
Ah, you. How lovely.

10:53.960 --> 10:55.925
Again.

10:55.960 --> 10:58.960
Twice in one week.
We are becoming old friends.

11:02.960 --> 11:05.925
This is my other son, Gerry.

11:05.960 --> 11:08.605
- The animal boy.
- Well, I wouldn't call him...

11:08.640 --> 11:10.125
Yes, I'm happy with that.
You must know Theo?

11:13.960 --> 11:14.960
And this is Basil.

11:15.960 --> 11:19.445
And Lugaretzia, who is just recovering

11:19.480 --> 11:20.960
from one of her illnesses.

11:24.960 --> 11:26.000
Please.

11:29.960 --> 11:31.925
- Do they bite?
- Yes.

11:31.960 --> 11:33.960
CONVERSATION IN GREEK

11:37.960 --> 11:39.960
Why did you let your wife say yes
to coming on this trip?

11:41.480 --> 11:42.925
Why did you invite her?

11:42.960 --> 11:44.925
I panicked.

11:44.960 --> 11:47.925
She's been this big absent figure
in my life for so long,

11:47.960 --> 11:50.925
and then, suddenly there she was,
by the hanging cheeses.

11:50.960 --> 11:53.925
You and I have done nothing wrong.

11:53.960 --> 11:55.605
I know.

11:55.640 --> 11:57.925
Why are you telling me that?

11:57.960 --> 12:00.765
Maybe you and she will hit it on.

12:00.800 --> 12:01.925
Hit it off.

12:01.960 --> 12:04.960
You see? When I get nervous,
my English goes to pot.

12:06.800 --> 12:07.925
Goes to pot?

12:07.960 --> 12:09.925
Yes.

12:09.960 --> 12:11.925
Right, listen up, everyone.

12:11.960 --> 12:13.925
There are eight of us,
plus the stupid dog.

12:13.960 --> 12:14.925
You're a stupid dog.

12:14.960 --> 12:17.925
And transport is one boat,
and one motorcar.

12:17.960 --> 12:19.925
Now, Lugaretzia gets car sick.

12:19.960 --> 12:21.925
Well, she gets seasick as well,
actually,

12:21.960 --> 12:23.925
but it's easy to be sick in the sea.

12:23.960 --> 12:26.925
I also suffer from seasickness, in fact.

12:26.960 --> 12:28.445
Theo!

12:28.480 --> 12:29.925
Theo is perfect in every way.

12:29.960 --> 12:30.925
No!

12:30.960 --> 12:32.925
Now, Mrs Hakiopulos...

12:32.960 --> 12:34.925
That's a bit of a mouthful, isn't it?

12:34.960 --> 12:35.960
No.

12:37.960 --> 12:39.925
Right, well,
I have you down for the boat.

12:39.960 --> 12:41.960
No, I go in my husband's car.

12:43.960 --> 12:44.925
Car.

12:44.960 --> 12:47.285
I'm happy to go in the boat.

12:47.320 --> 12:48.605
Roger and I will sail.

12:48.640 --> 12:51.925
See if we can look out
for loggerhead turtles.

12:51.960 --> 12:54.285
That's five sailing,
and only three in the motorcar.

12:54.320 --> 12:55.960
Hmm, not ideal.

12:58.960 --> 12:59.925
Um...

12:59.960 --> 13:02.960
Mother, you may as well go in the car.

13:12.960 --> 13:15.925
'Dear Mother, Les, and the boy,

13:15.960 --> 13:18.925
'I am sitting in Prue and Geoffrey's
living room.

13:18.960 --> 13:23.925
'Either the clock is very loud,
or Dorset is very quiet.'

13:23.960 --> 13:26.925
Do come along to the talk
I'm giving this morning, Margo.

13:26.960 --> 13:28.925
You'll be entertained royally.

13:28.960 --> 13:30.925
Thank you, beloved.

13:30.960 --> 13:31.925
What is the title of the talk?

13:31.960 --> 13:34.965
"My life as an insurance broker."

13:35.000 --> 13:36.445
Hmm...

13:36.480 --> 13:37.960
What is that?

13:39.480 --> 13:40.925
Insurance broking is...

13:40.960 --> 13:42.960
Don't tell her yet!
Keep your powder dry.

13:44.960 --> 13:45.960
Indubitably.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.925
'Your cousin Prue and Geoffrey

13:50.960 --> 13:54.925
'are the most peculiar people
I've ever met.

13:54.960 --> 13:57.925
'I may be more normal than I thought.'

13:57.960 --> 14:01.925
Of course, if it wasn't for Basil
losing Aunt Hermione's legacy,

14:01.960 --> 14:03.925
we'd have retired to a life in clover.

14:03.960 --> 14:06.960
Calm now, or you'll stab yourself
with your knitting needle again.

14:08.960 --> 14:11.445
You know Basil's staying
in our guesthouse now?

14:11.480 --> 14:12.925
Yes.

14:12.960 --> 14:14.125
I do.

14:14.160 --> 14:15.925
Look, you've bent it now.

14:15.960 --> 14:17.960
Oh, leave me alone!

14:19.960 --> 14:21.925
I thought Basil was a homosexual,

14:21.960 --> 14:24.925
like Sven,
mother's first boyfriend on Corfu,

14:24.960 --> 14:28.925
but he turned out to be in love with
her and bought her a little bridge,

14:28.960 --> 14:30.960
mistakenly thinking it was one
of her favourite things.

14:32.960 --> 14:34.960
It's all true.

14:35.960 --> 14:37.960
Don't try and make me look
like the weird one.

14:53.960 --> 14:56.925
You're looking rather anxious, Spiros.

14:56.960 --> 14:58.125
Why is that?

14:58.160 --> 15:00.925
I have a precious cargo.

15:00.960 --> 15:02.925
You're very sweet.

15:02.960 --> 15:04.640
I don't mean you.

15:08.960 --> 15:10.925
I love your dress, Dimitra.

15:10.960 --> 15:13.640
Thank you. And I love yours.

15:16.160 --> 15:18.925
I love your trousers, Spiros(!)

15:18.960 --> 15:20.640
You're very funny, Basil.

15:21.800 --> 15:22.965
Does Spiros often take you out
for drives?

15:23.000 --> 15:24.925
Only when we first met.

15:24.960 --> 15:27.960
When he was trying to impress me.

15:34.960 --> 15:35.925
What are you saying?

15:35.960 --> 15:38.160
My Greek's coming along well.
I know what they said.

15:39.640 --> 15:41.960
HE SPEAKS GIBBERISH

16:06.960 --> 16:07.965
Any better, Theo?

16:08.000 --> 16:10.445
- I'd rather be in the car.
- Yeah, sorry about that,

16:10.480 --> 16:11.925
I thought Mother and Mrs Spiros

16:11.960 --> 16:13.285
should get to know each other better.

16:13.320 --> 16:15.925
Fine. But Basil must die.

16:15.960 --> 16:17.925
We will die first. Drowned.

16:17.960 --> 16:20.925
Cheer up, everyone. We'll have
a nice big lunch, and then...

16:21.960 --> 16:23.925
And then we'll see Larry again.

16:23.960 --> 16:25.965
- That's not like you, Leslie.
- Well, I miss him.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.925
I miss his...

16:27.960 --> 16:29.960
ugly face.

16:34.960 --> 16:36.765

18:08.480 --> 18:10.925

No, I will tell people.

18:14.960 --> 18:15.925
What's that?

18:15.960 --> 18:18.925
I fear it's fishermen using dynamite
to kill fish.

18:18.960 --> 18:21.285
That is so cruel and disgusting.

18:21.320 --> 18:24.925
It's punishable by several years
in prison, but they risk it anyway.

18:24.960 --> 18:26.605
I expect you approve?

18:26.640 --> 18:27.925
As it's all hunting.

18:27.960 --> 18:29.445
A fun day out.

18:29.480 --> 18:30.605
I don't approve.

18:30.640 --> 18:32.445
But I do approve of throwing people
in the sea

18:32.480 --> 18:33.960
so they can learn their lesson!

18:48.960 --> 18:50.925
Now, I know we're here for a picnic,

18:50.960 --> 18:52.125
but you'll forgive me

18:52.160 --> 18:54.925
if we make a bit of a fuss
of my eldest, Lawrence.

18:54.960 --> 18:56.925
Of course. Lawrence of Kerkyra.

18:58.960 --> 19:00.960
Oh, that is tremendous.

19:02.160 --> 19:03.925
It's a play on Lawrence of Arabia.

19:03.960 --> 19:04.925
Yes, I know that.

19:04.960 --> 19:06.925
Kerkyra is Greek for Corfu.

19:06.960 --> 19:10.320
Yes, I know that.
I've been here since 1935!

19:17.960 --> 19:19.960
Larry!

19:21.640 --> 19:22.925
Oh.

19:22.960 --> 19:24.960
That's good timing.

19:33.320 --> 19:34.925
Looks like Gerry's had a swim already.

19:34.960 --> 19:37.445
You just can't stop them, can you?

19:37.480 --> 19:39.960
KNOCKS ON DOOR

19:40.960 --> 19:43.925
You know, I wrote to Larry
to tell him we were coming.

19:43.960 --> 19:46.445
He's a writer. Very avant-garde.

19:46.480 --> 19:49.960
Oh, as you say in Greece,
bloody rude! Ha!

19:51.960 --> 19:54.160
He's probably gone for a walk.

19:57.960 --> 19:58.960
Larry!

20:01.960 --> 20:03.925
'Dear Tribe of Durrells.

20:03.960 --> 20:07.765
'Or, should I say,
chere Tribu de Durrells.

20:07.800 --> 20:10.925
'Greetings from Paris,
where I'm now living.

20:10.960 --> 20:15.925
'A passing yacht was heading
for Italy, so I hopped aboard.

20:15.960 --> 20:17.925
'A shame I couldn't say goodbye.

20:17.960 --> 20:20.765
'But I know you will understand.'

20:20.800 --> 20:22.960
The bastard's not here, is he?

20:25.960 --> 20:28.605
'I had no money, but have
badgered myself free lodging,

20:28.640 --> 20:30.925
'as my exquisite, filthy novel

20:30.960 --> 20:34.960
'has had some succes d'estime
among the reliably-sexual French.

20:36.960 --> 20:38.925
'It is wildly exciting here.

20:38.960 --> 20:40.925
'To quote St Augustine,

20:40.960 --> 20:42.925
'the world is a book,

20:42.960 --> 20:45.960
'and those who do not travel
read only one page.'

20:48.960 --> 20:51.000
Turn it around again.

20:52.480 --> 20:53.960
Larry may have drowned, of course.

20:55.160 --> 20:56.925
I mean, I hope not.

20:56.960 --> 20:58.925
So, Mrs Durrell.

20:58.960 --> 21:00.445
How was your trip in the car?

21:00.480 --> 21:02.925
Generally pleasant.

21:02.960 --> 21:04.960
Although I can't deny
there are tensions.

21:06.960 --> 21:09.925
I'm sorry you vomited over Leslie.

21:09.960 --> 21:11.925
- Oh, you heard?
- Yes, I apologise.

21:11.960 --> 21:13.925
No, I'm sorry for you, not Leslie.

21:13.960 --> 21:16.925
As a child, he was endlessly sick
over me.

21:16.960 --> 21:19.925
And then he'd usually go to bed
and wet it.

21:19.960 --> 21:21.960
12 years of rubber sheets.

21:23.960 --> 21:25.925
Mrs Durrells.

21:25.960 --> 21:27.925
Thank you for the excellent food.

21:27.960 --> 21:29.925
Oh, well, there's no need
to be so official.

21:29.960 --> 21:32.925
Don't stop him saying nice things
about cooking.

21:32.960 --> 21:33.960
It never happens to me!

21:39.000 --> 21:40.960
What are they saying?

21:41.960 --> 21:43.800
I didn't hear...

21:45.640 --> 21:47.960
Well, Spiros is always
very complimentary to me.

21:48.960 --> 21:50.960
It's hard to say the right thing.

21:56.960 --> 21:58.960
They're dynamiting fish!

22:01.960 --> 22:03.925
Stop that right now!

22:03.960 --> 22:05.925
Or you'll go to prison
for several years!

22:05.960 --> 22:07.925
And I know, because I was in
the Corfu police.

22:07.960 --> 22:09.925
You absolute sods!

22:09.960 --> 22:12.445
Gerry, where did you learn
that language?

22:12.480 --> 22:15.125
From Larry, and Leslie, and Margo,
and... you.

22:15.160 --> 22:16.925
All right.

22:16.960 --> 22:17.960
Only asking.

22:24.960 --> 22:26.925
Was that too specific?

22:26.960 --> 22:28.160
Knowing you, I'd imagine so.

22:43.640 --> 22:44.960
Oh!

22:48.960 --> 22:50.125
Oh, God.

22:50.160 --> 22:51.925
Shoo! Shoo!

22:51.960 --> 22:53.925
Get off!

22:53.960 --> 22:55.960
Away!

22:56.960 --> 22:59.800
You see, this is why
we should shoot animals.

23:01.960 --> 23:02.925
Fear not, everyone.

23:02.960 --> 23:05.925
Dimitra, do not worry your
sensationally-pretty head.

23:05.960 --> 23:09.285
I'm sure there will be a Taverna
nearby, and all will be well.

23:09.320 --> 23:10.960
Right, come on.

23:12.800 --> 23:13.960
I'll keep this safe.

23:20.960 --> 23:22.925
One push,

23:22.960 --> 23:25.960
and you and Spiros could live
happily ever after.

23:43.960 --> 23:45.925
Looks like it's here or nowhere.

23:45.960 --> 23:48.925
Or we could get back in our vehicles
and find somewhere else?

23:48.960 --> 23:50.925
No, let's not do that.

23:50.960 --> 23:53.925
So, let's drink this now.

23:53.960 --> 23:56.605
Dimitra, you are awash with good ideas.

23:56.640 --> 23:58.285
No, it's a present, for Larry.
Wherever he is.

24:00.960 --> 24:01.965
Oh, Basil!

24:02.000 --> 24:03.925
That could have happened to anyone.

24:03.960 --> 24:05.925
I think the phrase
you're looking for is,

24:05.960 --> 24:07.960
"The drinks are on me."

24:10.960 --> 24:12.960
Go on, shoo.

24:16.960 --> 24:18.800
Magazi.

24:22.960 --> 24:24.960
Magazi!

24:29.960 --> 24:31.925
Oh!

24:31.960 --> 24:34.605
At last. Enchantresses.

24:34.640 --> 24:36.925
Mrs Durrell.

24:36.960 --> 24:37.925
Pull up a bottom.

24:37.960 --> 24:39.925
Just ignore him.

24:39.960 --> 24:41.925
If he gives us any trouble,

24:41.960 --> 24:42.965
we'll have him ejected by the landlord.

24:43.000 --> 24:46.925
Now, what can I serve you with,
my dears?

24:46.960 --> 24:48.925
Well, in that case, we're leaving.

24:48.960 --> 24:51.965
No, no, please. We'll just stay
for a pie and a drink.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.925
Yes, yes, I do a lovely, er...

24:54.960 --> 24:57.925
Well, it's all lovely, look.

24:57.960 --> 24:58.925
You know this man?

24:58.960 --> 25:00.125
Captain Creech.

25:00.160 --> 25:03.925
We meet about once a year,
and something bad always happens.

25:03.960 --> 25:05.285
Well, you're not getting any booze.

25:05.320 --> 25:06.925
I should hope not. He's 14.

25:06.960 --> 25:08.925
Didn't stop me.

25:08.960 --> 25:12.605
I done everything
before I sprouted any body hair.

25:12.640 --> 25:14.925
What are the chances of you being here?

25:14.960 --> 25:18.925
Well, as a matter of fact,
I came to visit Larry.

25:18.960 --> 25:21.925
A pleasure seeker, like myself.

25:21.960 --> 25:25.445
And the chap that owned this
offered me a very good deal.

25:25.480 --> 25:27.125
So, where is he?

25:27.160 --> 25:29.925
I believe he's running a brothel
in Albania.

25:29.960 --> 25:31.925
No, Larry!

25:31.960 --> 25:34.285
Oh, oh! Er... Paris!

25:34.320 --> 25:36.125
A different kind of paradise.

25:36.160 --> 25:37.925
He can't have received my letter.

25:37.960 --> 25:40.000
Oh, he didn't. It's here.

25:41.640 --> 25:43.925
I gave it a good read, obviously.

25:43.960 --> 25:48.965
I was very sorry to hear
your daughter Margo had jumped ship.

25:49.000 --> 25:52.285
Bit of a mad one.

25:52.320 --> 25:55.925
But you get a very appreciative mention.

25:55.960 --> 25:57.640
That's a very personal subject!

25:59.960 --> 26:02.960
What did you write about Spiros
in your letter?

26:05.960 --> 26:07.925
I imagine...

26:07.960 --> 26:09.965
it was how precious he is.

26:10.000 --> 26:12.925
And how lucky you are to have him.

26:12.960 --> 26:14.125
Yes.

26:14.160 --> 26:15.960
I am.

26:16.960 --> 26:18.925
Yippee!

26:18.960 --> 26:21.925
Well, to show there's no hard feelings,

26:21.960 --> 26:23.925
I'd like to serve you all lunch.

26:23.960 --> 26:26.160
Eight drachma a head.

26:27.960 --> 26:30.800
Payable in advance.

26:35.960 --> 26:37.925
Was it all excitement?

26:37.960 --> 26:39.925
No, it wasn't.

26:39.960 --> 26:42.925
There were quiet years in the office.

26:43.960 --> 26:46.925
In fact, there were quiet decades.

26:46.960 --> 26:48.925
The 1900s.

26:48.960 --> 26:50.925
They were...

26:50.960 --> 26:52.960
rather quiet.

26:58.320 --> 26:59.960
Um...

27:02.000 --> 27:05.925
There's a tremendous amount
of filing in insurance broking.

27:05.960 --> 27:09.765
The risk of fire
was always on our minds.

27:09.800 --> 27:10.960
Come on.

27:12.960 --> 27:16.925
Particularly during the, er,
quiet decades,

27:16.960 --> 27:18.960
which I mentioned earlier.

27:21.960 --> 27:23.960
All that paper going up.

27:26.160 --> 27:27.960
But it, erm...

27:28.960 --> 27:30.160
It never happened.

27:34.960 --> 27:38.125
I'm going to bring this
to a halt now, a little early.

27:38.160 --> 27:43.960
I think I may have overestimated
just how interesting my life was.

27:53.640 --> 27:55.960
I loved that talk!

27:56.960 --> 27:58.925
I'm Margo Durrell, and I'm lucky enough

27:58.960 --> 28:01.925
to be Geoffrey's great-niece-in-law,
or something.

28:01.960 --> 28:03.925
Sit down.

28:03.960 --> 28:06.925
But it shows that even the most
grown up of us can lose confidence.

28:06.960 --> 28:08.925
So, let me fill in
for his shortened talk

28:08.960 --> 28:12.925
by describing my life
on the Greek island of Corfu,

28:12.960 --> 28:15.925
where my widowed mother took us
a few years ago to live.

28:15.960 --> 28:19.925
My older brother Larry calls Britain
Pudding Island.

28:19.960 --> 28:20.965
Which he means meanly,

28:21.000 --> 28:23.925
but who in their right mind
doesn't love pudding?

28:23.960 --> 28:25.925
But if Britain's a pudding,

28:25.960 --> 28:28.640
Corfu is, let's say...

28:30.320 --> 28:32.765
..a sensual platter of seafood,

28:32.800 --> 28:35.285
sun-kissed vegetables,

28:35.320 --> 28:36.960
and exploding fruit.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.960
Here we are.

28:41.160 --> 28:43.320
Wrap your gizzards round those, eh?

28:45.960 --> 28:47.800
He trained at the Savoy, you know.

28:50.960 --> 28:53.925
So, Basil, what are you doing
in this country?

28:53.960 --> 28:56.925
I'm on a long holiday, really.

28:56.960 --> 28:58.925
Got some money set by.

28:58.960 --> 28:59.925
Give it to me!

28:59.960 --> 29:01.125
Righty ho.

29:01.160 --> 29:02.925
How would you like it, cash or cheque?

29:02.960 --> 29:04.320
Or I can do jewellery?

29:06.480 --> 29:08.960
What a saucy laugh.

29:09.960 --> 29:11.925
Gerry, how was your zoo?

29:11.960 --> 29:13.925
Well, I want to open it to the public,

29:13.960 --> 29:14.925
but it's still not ready.

29:14.960 --> 29:16.925
Oh, if you're looking for more critters,

29:16.960 --> 29:17.925
I've got two out the back

29:17.960 --> 29:19.965
that were left
by some rather stupid sailors.

29:20.000 --> 29:22.285
Oh, no, Gerry can't take any more.

29:22.320 --> 29:25.285
Well, if you don't buy them,
I shall probably eat them.

29:25.320 --> 29:27.925
I've given the little shits
fair warning.

29:27.960 --> 29:28.925
Well, what are they?

29:28.960 --> 29:30.125
Oh, I don't know. Badgers?

29:30.160 --> 29:31.925
You'll have to ask them yourself.

29:36.960 --> 29:38.765
What are you muttering?

29:38.800 --> 29:39.925
This is bad.

29:39.960 --> 29:42.925
Husband and wife like this,

29:42.960 --> 29:43.960
strangers.

29:45.960 --> 29:48.925
I'm going to go check on my boat.

29:48.960 --> 29:51.925
All enjoying themselves? Ah!

29:51.960 --> 29:55.125
This is my friend Lefteris,

29:55.160 --> 29:57.925
who's a dab hand at the santouri!

29:57.960 --> 30:00.925
Would you like to be entertained?

30:00.960 --> 30:01.960
10 drachma.

30:02.960 --> 30:04.125
Right.

30:04.160 --> 30:07.640
10 drachma not to play.

30:15.960 --> 30:18.925
'Much as I enjoin everyone to travel,

30:18.960 --> 30:21.925
'there is a melancholy
that you carry in your suitcase

30:21.960 --> 30:24.960
'like a pair of weighty boots.

30:26.960 --> 30:28.480
'The joy of belonging.

30:29.960 --> 30:31.925
'To family, friends, home.

30:31.960 --> 30:36.960
'In exchange for the uncertainties
of a lunatic, unchartered world.

30:39.320 --> 30:41.925
'I'm drinking a bottle of Bordeaux
I've just nicked,

30:41.960 --> 30:45.960
'so this letter could be long
and... somewhat free-form.'

30:59.320 --> 31:00.925
Oi!

31:00.960 --> 31:02.960
Bugger off away from our boat!

31:09.800 --> 31:11.925
I have friends
in the Corfu Police Force!

31:11.960 --> 31:14.960
So you are playing with fire!

31:34.640 --> 31:36.960
Yes, I should think so!

32:00.960 --> 32:04.925
So, this is how they braid
their hair in the Ionian Islands.

32:04.960 --> 32:07.925
Whereas in Turkey...
My last boyfriend was from Izmir.

32:07.960 --> 32:09.925
..they prefer something more like this.

32:09.960 --> 32:12.925
Is this too much?

32:12.960 --> 32:15.960
I think we're all
far too conservative, don't you?

32:21.320 --> 32:23.925
Well, I've been thinking for some time

32:23.960 --> 32:26.605
of going Titian. Or blonde.

32:26.640 --> 32:29.960
Or you could jump straight
to white hair.

32:30.960 --> 32:32.445
So, Margo...

32:32.480 --> 32:34.925
You're a trained beauty advisor?

32:34.960 --> 32:37.925
Self-taught.
I find that so much more creative.

32:37.960 --> 32:41.605
After all, nobody teaches one
how to make love.

32:43.960 --> 32:45.925
No, I'm toying with formal training,

32:45.960 --> 32:47.765
but I'm finding out a lot about myself,

32:47.800 --> 32:48.925
so my future may lie elsewhere.

32:48.960 --> 32:51.925
Margo's staying in our home.

32:51.960 --> 32:54.925
She is very much part
of Prue's and my gang.

32:54.960 --> 32:57.960
We helped her through
her ugly spotty stage.

32:59.960 --> 33:02.960
And that's positively Macedonian.

33:13.960 --> 33:17.925
So, what else can go wrong today?

33:17.960 --> 33:19.925
Let's see what the day brings, shall we?

33:19.960 --> 33:22.765
Out of darkness comes light.

33:23.960 --> 33:26.605
What darkness have you in your life?

33:26.640 --> 33:29.925
Healthy children, your English money.

33:29.960 --> 33:31.925
Oh, well...

33:31.960 --> 33:33.925
My husband died,

33:33.960 --> 33:37.925
leaving me with four
actually rather troubled children.

33:37.960 --> 33:38.925
Eh?

33:38.960 --> 33:40.445
We have never had any money.

33:40.480 --> 33:42.960
We came here
so that we could live cheaply.

33:43.960 --> 33:45.925
But tell me about yourself.

33:45.960 --> 33:48.925
What makes you unhappy?

33:48.960 --> 33:50.960
Er... Being bored.

33:51.960 --> 33:54.925
Well, it's hard to imagine
being bored with Spiros.

33:54.960 --> 33:58.320
Oh, you will be surprised.

34:08.960 --> 34:10.925
(What are they saying?)

34:10.960 --> 34:12.925
(I wish they'd argue in English.)

34:12.960 --> 34:15.925
(He says she doesn't like him
much any more.)

34:15.960 --> 34:17.925
(Well, she is quite hard work.)

34:17.960 --> 34:20.925
To be fair, she has entered
the lion's den.

34:20.960 --> 34:21.925
You are all quite intimidating.

34:21.960 --> 34:23.925
No, we're not!

34:23.960 --> 34:25.284
Idiot.

34:25.320 --> 34:26.925
Right.

34:26.960 --> 34:29.925
Who wants to sing along to the...

34:29.960 --> 34:31.925
Well, the weird instrument?

34:31.960 --> 34:33.800
Anyone?

34:38.960 --> 34:40.925
There we are, boy.

34:40.960 --> 34:44.960
All yours for, er... 25 drachma.

34:46.960 --> 34:47.925
Bush babies.

34:47.960 --> 34:48.965
Skunks. Stand aside.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.960
Lemurs. From Madagascar.

34:54.960 --> 34:56.960
Oh, my goodness. Look at them.

35:01.960 --> 35:02.925
What do they eat?

35:02.960 --> 35:05.960
Anything not cooked by Creech.

35:07.960 --> 35:09.960
BASIL: They're not interested
in the food.

35:14.960 --> 35:16.925
Oh, my goodness.

35:16.960 --> 35:18.925
Don't panic, Dimitra.

35:18.960 --> 35:19.960
I can't look.

35:27.000 --> 35:28.445
Shut the door!

35:28.480 --> 35:30.125
- Keep them in.
- All right!

35:30.160 --> 35:31.925
All right!

35:31.960 --> 35:33.925
Right, you win.

35:33.960 --> 35:36.320
Stop playing.

35:37.960 --> 35:40.925
- Did you not hear the explosion?
- What? No.

35:40.960 --> 35:42.445
They've blown up the Sea Cow.

35:42.480 --> 35:44.960
Oh, darling, you loved that boat.

35:46.960 --> 35:49.960
We must all go home in the car.

36:06.320 --> 36:07.925
Will this be all right?

36:07.960 --> 36:08.925
Well, it's not built

36:08.960 --> 36:11.925
for eight people, a dog,
and two weasels.

36:11.960 --> 36:13.925
You should take it slowly.

36:13.960 --> 36:14.925
You think?

36:14.960 --> 36:17.925
Thank you. Slowly's a good idea.

36:17.960 --> 36:20.925
I've never sat on a man's lap before.

36:20.960 --> 36:21.925
How are you finding it?

36:21.960 --> 36:23.445
Disconcerting.

36:23.480 --> 36:24.925
Think of Basil as Father Christmas.

36:24.960 --> 36:26.925
Ho-ho-ho, little boy.

36:26.960 --> 36:28.960
I'll try standing up.

36:33.960 --> 36:36.925
What a chance to get to know
each other even better.

36:36.960 --> 36:38.925
We already know each other well enough.

37:24.960 --> 37:26.960
Hello, darling.

37:31.960 --> 37:33.925
Oh, no, I don't believe this.

37:33.960 --> 37:35.925
We have to wait.

37:35.960 --> 37:36.925
She's overheating.

37:36.960 --> 37:38.925
The car, or your wife?

37:38.960 --> 37:40.960
Sorry. I'm upset about my boat.

37:43.800 --> 37:45.285
I apologise, Dimitra.

37:45.320 --> 37:46.965
It was supposed to be such a lovely day.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.925
Well, it's brilliant
now I've got two lemurs.

37:49.960 --> 37:52.925
To be honest, apart from meeting
the vivacious Dimitra,

37:52.960 --> 37:53.925
it's far from brilliant.

37:53.960 --> 37:56.925
Lunch cost me the equivalent of £800.

37:56.960 --> 37:59.925
You did smash Larry's very expensive
bottle of champagne.

37:59.960 --> 38:02.765
If you'd communicated properly
with your son in the first place,

38:02.800 --> 38:04.605
we wouldn't have been on
this wild goose chase.

38:04.640 --> 38:07.925
But otherwise, what a nice day...

38:07.960 --> 38:10.925
Mr Theodoros was sick on Leslie's lap.

38:10.960 --> 38:12.925
Then my boat was blown up.

38:12.960 --> 38:14.605
So I've had the worst day!

38:14.640 --> 38:16.445
I'm always the victim.

38:16.480 --> 38:18.925
For the record, you did push Gerry
into the sea with his clothes on.

38:18.960 --> 38:19.925
Well, all right.

38:19.960 --> 38:22.960
But apart from all that,
what a nice day.

38:28.960 --> 38:30.960
I'm going to walk home.

38:52.960 --> 38:54.925
(What are they saying?)

38:54.960 --> 38:56.960
(I don't want to tell you.)

39:13.640 --> 39:15.285
Everyone, I'm sorry...

39:15.320 --> 39:18.960
you had to see my... private problems.

39:20.960 --> 39:22.960
I spoiled your day.

39:24.960 --> 39:27.160
No. You really didn't.

39:30.960 --> 39:32.925
Well done, dear.

39:32.960 --> 39:34.925
You took Lytchett Matravers by storm

39:34.960 --> 39:38.925
with your improvised ramblings.

39:38.960 --> 39:40.925
People are so nice here.

39:40.960 --> 39:42.925
I think I'll stay in the area for a bit.

39:42.960 --> 39:44.925
Are people not nice in Greece?

39:44.960 --> 39:45.925
Yes, they are,

39:45.960 --> 39:49.925
but I love the fact that in England,
people speak English.

39:50.960 --> 39:52.925
- We wouldn't have it any other way, would we, dear?
- No.

39:52.960 --> 39:54.925
It sounds obvious, but today I realised

39:54.960 --> 39:57.925
that the key to confidence
is being able to express one's self.

39:57.960 --> 39:59.960
I feel I can do anything now.

40:00.960 --> 40:01.960
Hello again.

40:03.960 --> 40:06.925
I was walking home, and I realised
we might be able to help each other.

40:06.960 --> 40:10.285
- Oh?
- My daughter Maud's governess had to leave suddenly.

40:10.320 --> 40:12.960
And I was wondering
if you could take over?

40:13.960 --> 40:14.925
Gosh.

40:14.960 --> 40:18.925
You have, well, the oomph
that my daughter needs.

40:18.960 --> 40:21.605
I would love to be a governess.

40:21.640 --> 40:23.960
Oh, how splendid.

40:25.320 --> 40:26.925
Here's Maud.

40:26.960 --> 40:29.320
Maud, this is Miss Durrell.

40:30.960 --> 40:32.960
Hello, Maud.

40:38.640 --> 40:40.925
Lovely eyes, strong teeth, firm calves.

40:40.960 --> 40:42.925
Stop now.

40:42.960 --> 40:45.925
Well, I'm not saying that Dimitra
could do better than Spiros...

40:45.960 --> 40:47.925
What a bloody woman.

40:47.960 --> 40:49.960
If she was that brilliant...

40:50.960 --> 40:53.925
..they wouldn't be sucking the life
out of each other.

40:53.960 --> 40:56.605
She can suck the life out of me
whenever she likes.

40:56.640 --> 40:58.925
Well, she won't be rushing
to join us on another picnic,

40:58.960 --> 41:01.125
except to maybe sprinkle arsenic
on the cheese straws.

41:01.160 --> 41:03.925
That's the best thing
about my husband dying young.

41:03.960 --> 41:06.960
We never had time to irritate
the hell out of each other.

41:16.960 --> 41:18.445
Excuse my hair.

41:18.480 --> 41:20.125
It fell out.

41:20.160 --> 41:23.925
I have syphilis.

41:23.960 --> 41:24.925
Ooh.

41:24.960 --> 41:26.125
Did she say she has syphilis?

41:26.160 --> 41:28.605
Yes. Yes, she did.

41:28.640 --> 41:30.925
Right, well, I'm going for a swim.

41:30.960 --> 41:31.925
Not now, Gerry.

41:31.960 --> 41:33.640
This is so exciting.

41:34.960 --> 41:37.960
Please could we put a limit on
the number of animals in the house.

41:39.960 --> 41:40.960
Er...

41:44.640 --> 41:45.960
Ta leme.

41:46.960 --> 41:48.925
Marvellous.

41:48.960 --> 41:50.925
Now that will be all round Corfu.

41:50.960 --> 41:51.925
What will?

41:51.960 --> 41:55.160
That this house is a freak show.

42:08.640 --> 42:09.925
'So, to sum up,

42:09.960 --> 42:12.605
'this is the difference
between our triangle of nations.

42:12.640 --> 42:14.125
'The English live in the past,

42:14.160 --> 42:16.605
'the Greeks live in the present,

42:16.640 --> 42:17.925
'and the French live in...

42:17.960 --> 42:19.765
'France.

42:19.800 --> 42:22.000
'Ba-boom. I thank you.

42:25.800 --> 42:28.925
'There is much chatter
here in Paris of impending war,

42:28.960 --> 42:30.925
'which makes me miss you even more.

42:30.960 --> 42:33.925
'Margo in England will be
insulated from such fears

42:33.960 --> 42:35.925
'thanks to the good old British refusal

42:35.960 --> 42:38.445
'to acknowledge that the rest
of the world matters,

42:38.480 --> 42:39.960
'or even exists.'

42:41.480 --> 42:45.925
'My talk in the village hall
went very well.

42:45.960 --> 42:49.925
'Though people are, of course,

42:49.960 --> 42:55.000
'shy of coming forward
to express praise or interest.

42:57.960 --> 42:59.765
'Now I am retired,

42:59.800 --> 43:02.960
'my life stretches forward like...

43:06.960 --> 43:08.925
'..an open road,

43:08.960 --> 43:11.925
'with my trusty mucker Prue beside me,

43:11.960 --> 43:13.925
'and nothing to hold us back,

43:13.960 --> 43:16.160
'except our imaginations.'

43:19.960 --> 43:22.125
'Dear Cousin Louisa.

43:22.160 --> 43:27.925
'The weather has been up to
its old tricks over the past week.

43:27.960 --> 43:32.960
'Choosing a hat has been
little short of a nightmare.

'I'm used to wind,

43:35.960 --> 43:39.925
'but our old friend sleet raised
its ugly head on Tuesday.'

43:39.960 --> 43:41.925
'I seem to have a job.

43:41.960 --> 43:43.925
'As a governess.

43:43.960 --> 43:47.640
'Yes, I know - very Jane Austen.

'To a child called Maud,

43:50.640 --> 43:54.960
'who looks like she killed

'But I feel armed and ready,

'having grown up in a family

44:00.960 --> 44:04.960

'in the art of self-reliance...

'..by never letting me get away
with anything.'

44:17.960 --> 44:21.285
LOUISA: 'Dear Margo.

44:21.320 --> 44:22.925
'We spent the day travelling,

44:22.960 --> 44:24.925
'and I was reminded why people
stay at home.

44:24.960 --> 44:29.925
'I hope Cousin Prue and Geoffrey
are not making you feel the same.

'Please resist the urge to poison them.

'If they are,

44:33.640 --> 44:36.160
'please resist the urge to club them

44:37.960 --> 44:40.925
'We went on a picnic today
and learnt at least two things.

44:40.960 --> 44:43.285
'Goats appear from nowhere.

'And there is no corner of
the world safe from Captain Creech.'

44:48.320 --> 44:49.925
So?

44:49.960 --> 44:52.765
Are we going to talk about
Spiros and his wife, and you,

44:52.800 --> 44:53.965
or just pretend today didn't happen?

44:54.000 --> 44:57.925
Oh, darling, I'm so sorry
about you and your blown-up boat.

44:57.960 --> 44:58.925
You know, you mustn't...

44:58.960 --> 45:00.480
- No, no.
- Answer the question.

45:04.960 --> 45:06.965
I'm glad I met Dimitra properly.

45:07.000 --> 45:09.925
In her absence, she'd become
such a bogeywoman,

45:09.960 --> 45:10.925
and of course, she isn't.

45:10.960 --> 45:12.925
She scared me.

45:12.960 --> 45:14.925
Wouldn't fancy your chances
in a fistfight, would you?

45:14.960 --> 45:16.960
I think I'd do all right.

45:18.160 --> 45:19.960
I went to a tough boarding school.

45:26.000 --> 45:28.960
She's no different from me, really.

45:33.960 --> 45:36.925
Well, you're not going to say it,
so I will.

45:36.960 --> 45:38.925
Their marriage is in trouble,

45:38.960 --> 45:42.960
and if you play your cards right,
you could be with Spiros.

45:49.960 --> 45:54.285
We are all foreign, and we need
to work hard to be accepted.

45:54.320 --> 45:55.925
My friend has a new motorbike.

45:55.960 --> 45:58.605
Well, let's hope he doesn't
fall off it and die!

45:58.640 --> 46:00.925
What do you think you're doing?

46:00.960 --> 46:02.925
I had the same question for you.

46:02.960 --> 46:04.925
How can we make people here
like us more?

46:04.960 --> 46:05.925
Come to the Panegyri festival.

46:05.960 --> 46:06.925
You sent me in there

46:06.960 --> 46:09.160
to clear the way for your mother
to be with Spiros.

46:10.305 --> 46:16.184
