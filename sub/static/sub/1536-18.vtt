00:01.040 --> 00:02.007
Previously on Grimm...

00:02.080 --> 00:03.650
Now, if that kind of lock
has been cast upon it,

00:03.760 --> 00:06.127
then only Hexenbiest blood
can open it.

00:06.240 --> 00:08.048
No, no, no. No!

00:12.760 --> 00:14.603
Juliette. I need to
get some of my stuff.

00:14.680 --> 00:16.808
What,
so you're just moving out?

00:17.280 --> 00:19.851
Okay, I was normal
before I met all of you.

00:19.920 --> 00:22.446
I want my life back!

00:22.960 --> 00:24.041
And if I don't get it...

00:24.520 --> 00:25.601
What?

00:26.480 --> 00:27.766
You better watch out.

00:31.280 --> 00:34.727
"The Spirit you seek in the water
is only a reflection of yourself."

00:36.120 --> 00:37.360
No! Hank!

00:37.440 --> 00:40.284
Two Days From Now

00:43.800 --> 00:44.926
Hank!

00:47.880 --> 00:49.120
Hank, no!

00:52.000 --> 00:53.126
Hank.

00:53.800 --> 00:54.961
It's me.

00:58.120 --> 00:59.770
Now

01:02.160 --> 01:03.571
They're here.

01:03.680 --> 01:05.887
Okay, let's not talk
about Juliette, okay?

01:06.000 --> 01:07.968
I'm sure he'd like to keep his
mind off her for a while.

01:08.080 --> 01:09.206
I know.

01:10.320 --> 01:11.845
Hey.
Guys, come on in.

01:12.600 --> 01:15.046
Oh, Nick. Come here, I'm so
happy you could come over.

01:16.360 --> 01:19.170
Hey, Hank.
Hey, Rosalee. Monroe.

01:19.320 --> 01:23.166
Got a nice bottle of wine breathing
over here, all by its lonesome.

01:23.600 --> 01:25.011
You have anything
a little stronger?

01:26.280 --> 01:28.089
Uh... Sure.

01:28.160 --> 01:29.685
Smells good.

01:29.760 --> 01:31.888
It's gonna be nice to have a
home-cooked meal for a change.

01:31.960 --> 01:34.691
And here's to
a home-cooked meal!

01:35.040 --> 01:36.201
So,

01:36.840 --> 01:38.410
how are things?

01:42.680 --> 01:44.330
Look,
I don't want anybody to feel

01:45.720 --> 01:48.041
awkward about me
and Juliette.

01:48.360 --> 01:50.362
Yeah, no. Why would we?
Not at all.

01:50.520 --> 01:52.443
I know she tried
to blame all of you.

01:52.520 --> 01:53.806
We know that's
not her talking.

01:53.880 --> 01:55.609
No, it's not.

01:55.680 --> 01:57.125
I mean,
I wish she was talking.

01:57.200 --> 01:59.362
She's not answering
the phone.

01:59.440 --> 02:01.249
She's not showing
up to work, she...

02:01.400 --> 02:02.447
I don't even
know where she is.

02:02.520 --> 02:03.885
You know, when something
like this happens,

02:03.960 --> 02:05.371
it takes time
to figure it out.

02:05.640 --> 02:08.803
Yeah, well, I feel like
I'm running out of time.

02:09.160 --> 02:10.685
I'm afraid of what
she might do out there.

02:10.759 --> 02:12.603
There must be
something we can do.

02:12.800 --> 02:13.801
Like what?

02:14.480 --> 02:15.891
Tell me.
Am I missing something?

02:15.960 --> 02:17.246
'Cause I'm out
there every night

02:17.320 --> 02:18.970
driving the streets,
trying to find her,

02:19.040 --> 02:21.691
hoping that there's some way
that I can help her,

02:21.840 --> 02:23.330
or talk some sense
into her.

02:23.400 --> 02:25.084
Dude, we totally get it.

02:27.240 --> 02:30.244
I'm sorry,
I can't be here pretending

02:30.320 --> 02:31.890
that she's not
out there somewhere.

02:31.960 --> 02:34.327
I'm gonna have to take a rain check.
I'm just...

02:35.720 --> 02:37.085
I'm really sorry.

02:44.240 --> 02:45.765
Who's hungry?

02:47.840 --> 02:50.241
You know, just because this
Henrietta, whom I've never met,

02:50.320 --> 02:53.085
says it's irreversible,
doesn't mean it is.

02:53.160 --> 02:54.525
We need to talk
to Sean Renard.

02:54.600 --> 02:56.364
He's still got
the book that Adalind used,

02:56.440 --> 02:59.046
and there might be something in
there that could help Juliette.

02:59.640 --> 03:01.722
Then we're gonna
have to get that hat too.

03:01.800 --> 03:03.450
We're gonna go through that
book, through every spell,

03:03.520 --> 03:06.410
backwards and forwards, until
we find something that works.

03:06.480 --> 03:08.084
You're forgetting
the main ingredient.

03:08.160 --> 03:09.161
What's that?

03:10.000 --> 03:11.286
Juliette.

03:19.280 --> 03:21.726
What can I get you?
Vodka rocks. You pick it.

03:29.800 --> 03:31.006
You meeting someone?

03:31.080 --> 03:32.206
No.

03:33.960 --> 03:35.520
Why don't you let me
buy you that drink?

03:38.840 --> 03:41.650
Why don't I let you
buy me the next one, too?

03:44.280 --> 03:45.884
Bring her another.

03:46.680 --> 03:47.681
I'm Rick.

03:47.760 --> 03:49.569
You look like a Rick.

03:50.720 --> 03:52.370
What's your name?

03:52.480 --> 03:53.720
What do I look like?

03:54.320 --> 03:55.560
What's this, a game?

03:56.680 --> 03:58.330
Yeah.

04:00.600 --> 04:02.443
You look like...

04:04.120 --> 04:05.326
A Jackie.

04:06.160 --> 04:08.845
Wow, you are really good.

04:08.920 --> 04:10.922
Really? That's your name?

04:13.480 --> 04:14.766
It is now.

04:16.600 --> 04:17.839
Who's your friend?

04:20.920 --> 04:23.844
Hey, this is between
you and me.

04:23.920 --> 04:27.720
Yeah? You think you can
handle me all by yourself?

04:28.200 --> 04:30.680
You're kind of
a wild girl?

04:32.640 --> 04:33.880
You really
don't want to know.

04:34.040 --> 04:36.361
Yeah, I do.

04:36.680 --> 04:39.047
Trust me, you don't.

04:39.560 --> 04:41.688
Jackie, I just bought you
two drinks.

04:43.040 --> 04:44.451
What'd you
expect for two drinks?

04:44.520 --> 04:47.967
A little conversation.
Get to know each other, I...

04:48.720 --> 04:51.007
I want to find
out who you are.

04:51.080 --> 04:52.320
You really mean that?

04:52.400 --> 04:56.246
Yeah, I do. I find you
very attractive.

04:56.960 --> 04:58.450
You like my eyes?

04:59.760 --> 05:01.125
Yes.

05:01.200 --> 05:03.362
Do you like my lips?

05:03.640 --> 05:06.644
Yeah, I do. I like
everything about you.

05:07.520 --> 05:09.045
Everything?

05:11.600 --> 05:12.726
How 'bout now?

05:14.320 --> 05:15.321
Ah!

05:16.440 --> 05:17.680
Did you see that?

05:17.760 --> 05:19.125
Did you see that? Hey!

05:26.400 --> 05:27.401
I'm calling the cops.

06:16.360 --> 06:17.805
Who's there?

06:21.280 --> 06:22.691
Anybody in here?

06:26.640 --> 06:30.440
I'm giving you clear warning.
Anyone in here is gonna be sorry.

06:33.920 --> 06:34.921
Damn it.

06:37.320 --> 06:39.004
See how funny you find this.

07:21.240 --> 07:23.527
School custodian,
Lawrence Kilburn, 34,

07:23.600 --> 07:25.523
was working late last
night polishing floors.

07:25.600 --> 07:28.001
Principal found him when she
arrived around 6:00 a.m.

07:28.080 --> 07:30.970
Said the floor polisher was still running.
She called 9-1-1.

07:31.080 --> 07:33.128
Good morning.
Yeah, that too.

07:33.200 --> 07:36.363
County Sheriff was the first to respond.
We've worked with her before.

07:36.440 --> 07:38.727
Deputy Farris?
Yep. She secured the scene.

07:38.840 --> 07:40.683
Thank you so much.

07:40.760 --> 07:42.524
- Morning.
- Good morning.

07:43.560 --> 07:46.131
Good to see you.

07:46.200 --> 07:49.090
I'm afraid this case is about as weird
as the last one we did together.

07:51.400 --> 07:52.731
Looks like he's been mauled.

07:52.880 --> 07:54.211
I'd say it was
an animal attack,

07:54.280 --> 07:56.647
but we're inside the school,
which is odd.

07:56.720 --> 07:58.165
Unless someone's
pit bull got in.

07:58.240 --> 07:59.810
M.E. will tell us
if it's an animal.

07:59.880 --> 08:01.006
What about the kids?

08:01.080 --> 08:03.731
- Has class been canceled?
- First thing.

08:03.800 --> 08:05.325
So, what do we know
about Larry?

08:05.400 --> 08:06.720
I haven't done
any background yet,

08:06.760 --> 08:08.046
but the Principal
said he did his job.

08:08.120 --> 08:10.248
Wasn't very sociable, and
he worked here seven years.

08:10.400 --> 08:11.640
Where's the Principal?

08:11.760 --> 08:13.000
In her office.

08:13.080 --> 08:14.889
Let's let CSU have it. Yeah.

08:17.680 --> 08:18.681
Thanks for coming.
Yeah.

08:18.760 --> 08:19.760
You brought them.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.086
I did.

08:22.120 --> 08:24.327
I probably don't need to warn
you, but I'm going to anyway.

08:24.440 --> 08:27.887
Be very careful with these.
Right.

08:27.960 --> 08:29.644
And we can't close
the book.

08:30.080 --> 08:31.206
No.

08:32.080 --> 08:33.650
Nick know
you're doing this?

08:33.720 --> 08:35.847
No. We don't want to
give him false hope.

08:36.360 --> 08:37.964
You realize there
may not be any hope.

08:38.039 --> 08:40.964
Yeah, well,
we still gotta try.

08:41.080 --> 08:43.606
I mean we were all part of what
happened to Juliette, so...

08:43.679 --> 08:45.170
Have you talked to Juliette?

08:46.440 --> 08:47.720
Does that hurt?

08:48.400 --> 08:49.400
Yeah.

08:49.440 --> 08:50.680
So Will this.

08:51.280 --> 08:52.361
Good.

08:54.800 --> 08:56.928
Yeah, she's not the same.

08:57.800 --> 08:59.211
We know.

09:00.920 --> 09:04.003
Well, be careful. You may
do more harm than good.

09:07.040 --> 09:08.280
Been there.

09:10.800 --> 09:14.043
I don't understand how something
like this could happen.

09:14.120 --> 09:16.726
Did Mr. Kilburn have any problems
with anybody that you know of?

09:16.800 --> 09:20.486
Look, I don't get into
people's personal lives much.

09:20.600 --> 09:23.763
He wasn't exactly popular,
didn't engage much.

09:24.240 --> 09:25.810
Married? Family?

09:25.880 --> 09:29.885
I believe he was married once and
I think it ended in divorce.

09:29.960 --> 09:31.325
What about
problems here at school?

09:31.640 --> 09:33.960
Well, we did have an incident
at the beginning of the year.

09:34.320 --> 09:36.402
We have several minorities
here at the school

09:36.480 --> 09:38.323
and there's
been some bullying.

09:38.400 --> 09:40.721
One of our seniors,
a Native American boy,

09:40.800 --> 09:43.770
found some racial
slurs on his locker.

09:43.840 --> 09:46.889
It was reported to janitorial
staff, and it was cleaned up,

09:46.960 --> 09:49.327
but it appeared
again two more times.

09:49.720 --> 09:51.080
We never did
figure out who did it,

09:51.120 --> 09:53.566
but one morning I
came in especially early

09:53.640 --> 09:56.723
and discovered the same graffiti
on the boy's locker again.

09:56.800 --> 09:57.847
What's the graffiti?

09:57.920 --> 10:00.924
Stuff like, buffalo jockey,

10:01.000 --> 10:03.924
watch your red-skinned
back, white pride,

10:04.040 --> 10:06.611
bitch,
and some crude drawings.

10:06.680 --> 10:08.170
Who had access
to the school?

10:08.240 --> 10:10.720
Just the
custodial staff and myself.

10:10.800 --> 10:11.926
Were students involved?

10:12.000 --> 10:14.685
If they were, somebody
had to have let them in.

10:14.800 --> 10:16.609
What was the name of the
student this was directed at?

10:16.720 --> 10:18.529
Simon George.

10:18.600 --> 10:20.682
Unfortunately,
when he turned 18,

10:20.760 --> 10:23.730
he dropped out just weeks before
he was supposed to graduate.

10:23.800 --> 10:25.086
Do you have an
address on him?

10:25.400 --> 10:27.289
He was living with
his foster parent,

10:27.360 --> 10:29.931
but last I heard,
he left home.

10:30.040 --> 10:34.250
I felt we had failed him, but I
had no proof who had done this.

10:36.160 --> 10:39.881
If this kid Simon thinks the janitor
was involved, it could be revenge.

10:39.960 --> 10:42.042
Let's go to the precinct, run
a background on the janitor.

10:42.200 --> 10:43.804
Hey, do you guys mind
if I tag along with you?

10:43.880 --> 10:45.689
I think I know this
kid Simon's story.

10:45.760 --> 10:47.091
How?

10:47.160 --> 10:49.731
My ex-husband's Native American.
Same tribe.

11:40.360 --> 11:43.284
Looks like our victim Lawrence
Kilburn has a bit of a history.

11:43.360 --> 11:45.727
Drunk and disorderly,
a couple of assault charges,

11:45.800 --> 11:48.883
nothing too outrageous,
at least not on his record.

11:48.960 --> 11:51.645
Last few years he's
been pretty clean.

11:51.720 --> 11:53.404
Anything on the kid?

11:53.480 --> 11:57.963
Simon George entered foster care at age
five when his father was murdered.

11:58.520 --> 12:00.045
Mother died in childbirth.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.724
He was in the system
for a lot of years.

12:01.800 --> 12:04.485
I remember hearing something
about his father's murder.

12:04.560 --> 12:07.006
His father's
name was Gus George.

12:07.120 --> 12:09.964
Very formidable man.
Did a lot for the tribe.

12:10.120 --> 12:12.248
Some kind of road rage.

12:12.320 --> 12:15.722
Gus was in his truck with his
son, driving down Highway 26.

12:15.800 --> 12:18.246
He was pulled from the truck
and beaten to death.

12:18.680 --> 12:21.809
His son, Simon, was five,
witnessed the whole thing.

12:22.880 --> 12:25.724
He was so traumatized, that he
was never able to talk about it.

12:25.800 --> 12:27.000
Did they ever
catch who did it?

12:28.120 --> 12:32.125
No, no. They figured it
was more than one man.

12:33.320 --> 12:34.651
It was a real tragedy.

12:34.720 --> 12:36.449
And this is the same kid who
had graffiti on his locker?

12:36.520 --> 12:37.520
I think it is.

12:37.560 --> 12:39.369
So we need to
find Simon George.

12:40.400 --> 12:41.481
You got a last known
on him?

12:41.560 --> 12:42.607
Not on the record.

12:43.320 --> 12:45.288
Maybe the tribe
knows where he is.

12:45.400 --> 12:46.731
We have no
jurisdiction with the tribes.

12:46.840 --> 12:48.763
I know you don't, but
they know me over there.

12:48.840 --> 12:50.126
Make a call?

12:52.080 --> 12:55.801
Nick, just got a call
from Central Precinct.

12:55.920 --> 12:58.526
They've got a Juliette
Silverton in custody.

12:59.680 --> 13:00.680
What?

13:00.720 --> 13:03.451
I didn't want to get into it
without letting you know.

13:05.080 --> 13:06.445
Where has she been charged?

13:08.080 --> 13:09.889
They're holding
her on assault.

13:12.560 --> 13:13.971
I gotta go.
Hey, don't worry.

13:14.040 --> 13:15.160
Farris and I
can handle this.

13:15.240 --> 13:16.969
At least now I
know where she is.

13:17.080 --> 13:19.162
No, no. We'll come to you.

13:19.240 --> 13:21.561
Simon George moved out to the
reservation six months ago.

13:21.640 --> 13:22.801
All right, so they know
where we can find him.

13:22.880 --> 13:24.564
Not exactly.
We need to go out there.

13:24.640 --> 13:26.085
All right.

13:53.960 --> 13:55.610
Somebody there?

13:59.480 --> 14:01.881
Hold on,
I'll be out in a minute.

14:02.720 --> 14:04.563
I'm almost done.

14:12.880 --> 14:14.120
Thank you.

14:20.120 --> 14:21.406
What happened?

14:24.920 --> 14:26.490
Didn't you read
my arrest report?

14:26.800 --> 14:29.610
I did.
Wanna hear it from you.

14:30.800 --> 14:33.246
What do you wanna hear, Nick?
That I didn't do it?

14:34.440 --> 14:35.965
That it was all a mistake?

14:37.280 --> 14:40.284
That I'm still the same sweet
gal you fell in love with?

14:43.640 --> 14:44.971
Why are you doing this?

14:45.040 --> 14:47.646
I guess I'm just trying to be
the best Hexenbiest I can.

14:47.760 --> 14:49.842
You don't have to prove to me
that this is my fault.

14:49.920 --> 14:51.331
That's what you
think I'm doing?

14:51.400 --> 14:54.244
Juliette, you're not even giving
us a chance to figure this out.

14:54.320 --> 14:57.369
What do you want
to figure out, Nick?

14:57.480 --> 15:01.326
How a Grimm and a Hexenbiest are
just gonna live happily ever after?

15:02.040 --> 15:03.371
You don't scare me.

15:04.440 --> 15:05.646
And I'm not letting go.

15:06.080 --> 15:08.082
Aren't you scared
of what you might do to me?

15:08.840 --> 15:10.888
I could never
hurt you, Juliette.

15:13.040 --> 15:14.929
I wish I could say the same.

15:18.760 --> 15:20.842
But I just
don't know anymore.

15:21.640 --> 15:23.563
Because deep down,

15:23.640 --> 15:26.041
I do blame you for
what's happened to me

15:26.120 --> 15:28.851
and part of me
loves you for it,

15:29.480 --> 15:32.848
because I have never
felt like this before.

15:35.640 --> 15:37.404
It's ironic, isn't it?

15:39.320 --> 15:42.085
You've been
the special one for so long.

15:42.680 --> 15:45.604
You're connected to
a world that most people

15:45.680 --> 15:47.011
will never know or understand.

15:47.560 --> 15:49.289
And now I know
and I understand.

15:49.360 --> 15:50.850
And I don't
want to give it up.

15:51.920 --> 15:55.641
Just like you didn't want to
give it up, and now I know why.

15:56.360 --> 15:57.885
Once you're in it and you've

15:59.320 --> 16:01.891
seen it, and tasted it,

16:02.720 --> 16:04.131
and lived it,

16:05.480 --> 16:06.766
you can't go back.

16:08.440 --> 16:10.681
Everyone else
just seems blind.

16:12.520 --> 16:14.284
I like this power, Nick.

16:14.400 --> 16:16.243
And I know you do, too...
Stop it!

16:16.560 --> 16:17.891
I can't!

16:22.600 --> 16:24.841
You really think
that you can just

16:24.960 --> 16:28.407
take off your clothes and
crawl into bed with me again?

16:34.480 --> 16:36.482
And close your eyes?

16:42.600 --> 16:44.921
You know, I didn't need
to let them arrest me.

16:45.080 --> 16:48.084
I just wanted to see
if you'd come rescue me.

16:56.360 --> 16:59.762
I'm not letting you out, if that's
what you mean by, "rescue you."

17:00.760 --> 17:02.569
It's safer for you in here.

17:02.680 --> 17:04.125
And safer for you.

17:11.920 --> 17:13.126
You know what this is?

17:14.160 --> 17:15.445
Bear mother.

17:15.599 --> 17:18.523
Bears are believed to be men
that had taken on animal shape.

17:18.680 --> 17:20.011
Janelle.

17:20.119 --> 17:22.122
Hector, thank you so
much for seeing us.

17:22.200 --> 17:23.400
This is
Detective Hank Griffin.

17:23.560 --> 17:26.086
Nice to meet you. Right this way.
You too.

17:26.680 --> 17:29.251
Can you tell me why you're
looking for Simon George?

17:29.480 --> 17:32.160
Uh, we're investigating the murder
of a high school maintenance man,

17:32.200 --> 17:33.690
Larry Kilburn.

17:33.800 --> 17:36.087
Happened sometime
last night.

17:36.240 --> 17:38.242
I know the name.

17:38.320 --> 17:41.290
This have anything to do with the racist
graffiti they left on Simon's locker?

17:41.360 --> 17:43.800
We don't know yet, but we're
hoping to talk to Simon about it.

17:44.360 --> 17:47.409
Might have a little difficulty finding him.
He's on a Power Quest.

17:47.480 --> 17:48.811
That like a Vision Quest?

17:50.320 --> 17:52.163
Basically.

17:52.240 --> 17:56.370
Simon had not been really a part
of the tribe since he was five.

17:56.480 --> 17:58.244
After the incidents
at the school,

17:58.320 --> 18:01.642
he wanted to become more
involved with his heritage.

18:02.480 --> 18:04.005
This kid had
a hard time growing up

18:04.080 --> 18:06.526
and he wanted to
come to terms with it.

18:06.600 --> 18:08.090
He came to live
with a family here,

18:08.160 --> 18:09.810
and he came looking
for me when he was

18:09.880 --> 18:12.531
ready to find his
guardian spirit.

18:12.600 --> 18:14.523
I'm one of the
tribe's spiritual guides.

18:14.600 --> 18:16.489
I helped Simon
prepare for his journey.

18:16.560 --> 18:20.007
Hector is a dream reader, just like
his father and his grandfather.

18:20.160 --> 18:22.208
Then Simon should be
somewhere in the woods.

18:22.320 --> 18:26.370
I left Simon on Spirit Mountain.
He's on his third day.

18:26.440 --> 18:28.568
He might be back anytime,
but he could

18:28.640 --> 18:30.688
be gone for
another couple days.

18:30.760 --> 18:33.684
He's been fasting and without
sleep since he left.

18:33.840 --> 18:35.285
So, he'd be pretty
out of it by now.

18:35.520 --> 18:38.046
Hopefully he's connecting
with his guardian spirit.

18:38.120 --> 18:40.805
Which is usually
an animal of some kind.

18:40.880 --> 18:44.089
But we believe spirit
can inhabit all nature,

18:44.200 --> 18:48.524
animals, trees,
rocks, mountains, lakes.

18:49.040 --> 18:50.371
The search for
one's spirit guide

18:50.480 --> 18:52.801
can be the source
of a person's special power,

18:52.920 --> 18:54.843
spiritual and physical.

18:55.720 --> 18:58.087
So, Simon could be anywhere
on that mountain.

18:58.160 --> 19:00.288
And he didn't take
a cell phone with him.

19:00.360 --> 19:02.362
That would kind of
defeat the purpose.

19:02.440 --> 19:04.522
But it doesn't mean we
can't try finding him.

19:04.640 --> 19:06.640
Do you know anything about
the death of his father?

19:11.520 --> 19:13.010
I know a lot about it.

19:15.160 --> 19:16.969
Gus was a friend of mine.

19:17.840 --> 19:20.525
He was beat to death
on the side of the road,

19:20.600 --> 19:22.568
right in front of Simon.

19:23.240 --> 19:26.767
What they did was an act of hatred.
No money was taken.

19:27.520 --> 19:29.682
And they never
identified any suspects.

19:29.760 --> 19:31.489
They never even tried.

19:31.600 --> 19:32.806
Gus was an activist,

19:32.880 --> 19:34.609
pushed a lot of
tribal issues.

19:34.680 --> 19:36.728
They weren't too
sad when he walked on.

19:37.280 --> 19:40.363
That's why I'm glad that Simon
came back and is on a quest.

19:40.920 --> 19:43.491
I think it'll help him come to
some sort of peace with his past.

19:44.320 --> 19:45.651
Excuse me.

19:49.400 --> 19:51.368
Nick. You saw Juliette?

19:51.960 --> 19:54.281
- Yeah.
- How'd it go?

19:54.440 --> 19:56.124
She's definitely
pushing it to the limit.

19:56.200 --> 19:57.804
And she doesn't give
a damn what I think.

19:57.880 --> 19:59.609
What are you gonna do?

20:02.360 --> 20:05.284
I'm gonna keep her locked up
as long as I can.

20:05.400 --> 20:08.080
That way at least I know where she
is and I can keep talking to her.

20:08.120 --> 20:09.645
Well,
that's sort of a plan.

20:10.920 --> 20:13.844
Anyway, got another victim.

20:13.960 --> 20:17.521
Same M.O. Highway 26.
Declan's Auto Repair Shop.

20:17.600 --> 20:19.080
All right,
we'll meet you there.

20:19.840 --> 20:21.842
Declan Henry Burke.

20:22.000 --> 20:24.571
Sole owner and employee
of Declan's Auto Repair.

20:24.640 --> 20:26.290
Mailman found him.

20:26.320 --> 20:28.891
Pretty much the same
as our first vic. Yep.

20:28.960 --> 20:32.248
Did a background on him
and he did have a record.

20:32.320 --> 20:34.527
Arrested for assault,
drunk and disorderly.

20:34.640 --> 20:36.768
But he's been pretty clean
for the last several years.

20:36.880 --> 20:39.240
We need to see if there's a
connection between the two vics.

20:39.320 --> 20:40.526
Well he's got
a computer over there.

20:40.600 --> 20:43.251
I'll run Kilburn's name
through, see if he knows him.

20:43.320 --> 20:45.288
Do you think whoever's
doing this is using dogs?

20:47.640 --> 20:49.005
Possibly.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.288
Well, it is hard to trace a
bullet if he's not using a gun.

20:53.360 --> 20:54.771
It's a nasty way
to go.

20:57.680 --> 20:59.603
Found it!
Kilburn's in his contacts.

20:59.800 --> 21:01.370
So they know each other.
Yep.

21:01.480 --> 21:03.369
He's even got Kilburn's
birthday on here.

21:03.440 --> 21:05.090
And they have
similar records.

21:05.200 --> 21:07.009
All right, let's run every
name on these contacts

21:07.080 --> 21:09.526
and every name on Kilburn's
contacts, see if we get a match.

21:09.600 --> 21:10.920
And run background
checks on them.

21:10.960 --> 21:12.200
Yep. On it.

21:12.280 --> 21:14.601
Hey, hey.

21:14.680 --> 21:16.842
Hey.

21:16.960 --> 21:19.884
Hey, hey.

21:20.200 --> 21:23.522
Hey, hey, hey.

21:24.720 --> 21:29.362
Hey, hey, hey.

21:30.360 --> 21:33.443
Hey, hey.

21:33.800 --> 21:36.121
Hey.

21:36.200 --> 21:39.204
Hey, hey.

21:39.880 --> 21:41.370
Hey.

21:41.440 --> 21:44.091
Hey, hey.

22:08.760 --> 22:10.808
Anybody got a Hodge,
Frederick Hodge?

22:10.920 --> 22:12.001
No.
No.

22:12.080 --> 22:14.003
What about a Brad Scott?

22:14.080 --> 22:15.525
Eh...

22:15.600 --> 22:17.489
No.
And no.

22:17.560 --> 22:19.688
- Max McClay?
- Nope.

22:19.760 --> 22:21.444
Yeah, got one.

22:21.520 --> 22:23.204
McClay with two "C" s?
Right.

22:23.320 --> 22:26.164
Think it's Maximilian,
Maximus, or Maxwell?

22:26.280 --> 22:28.203
Why don't we go
with Maxwell.

22:28.280 --> 22:29.361
What of William Colvig?

22:29.440 --> 22:30.487
No.
No.

22:30.560 --> 22:34.201
Got a match on
Maxwell McClay. Best one yet.

22:34.920 --> 22:37.002
He's about the same age
as both Kilburn and Declan.

22:37.080 --> 22:39.924
And get this, Kilburn was
arrested once with Declan,

22:40.000 --> 22:42.321
and Declan was
arrested once with McClay.

22:43.160 --> 22:44.480
They're running
in the same crowd.

22:44.560 --> 22:47.131
So McClay could have killed the
other two, or he's the next victim.

22:47.200 --> 22:48.964
Got a last known
in Troutdale.

24:02.040 --> 24:03.371
McClay!

24:04.600 --> 24:05.886
McClay!

24:08.680 --> 24:09.841
Police!

24:10.280 --> 24:11.361
McClay!

24:14.400 --> 24:15.845
I'm going in.
I'll cover the back.

24:15.920 --> 24:17.684
Stay with McClay.

24:31.240 --> 24:32.241
Stop!

24:33.800 --> 24:34.961
I'm a Grimm.
I know you're Wesen.

24:35.040 --> 24:37.361
Get down on the ground, put
your hands behind your head.

24:37.440 --> 24:39.408
Hank! I got him.

24:41.440 --> 24:43.090
He's Wesen. I think.

24:43.160 --> 24:44.491
He looked at me.
He didn't react.

24:46.200 --> 24:47.247
I can see it, but...

24:53.400 --> 24:54.890
What the hell?

25:16.240 --> 25:17.401
Did you see
where he went?

25:17.480 --> 25:19.289
Yeah, that way.
Into the woods.

25:20.840 --> 25:23.844
Whatever it was,
it's gone now.

25:23.920 --> 25:25.604
- How's McClay?
- He's passed out.

25:25.720 --> 25:26.801
I called the paramedics.

25:28.040 --> 25:29.610
Something jumped off
the roof.

25:30.240 --> 25:31.241
What did you see?

25:31.840 --> 25:33.524
I'm not sure,
looked like something

25:33.600 --> 25:35.204
I had only heard
about in stories.

25:37.960 --> 25:40.088
I don't want
to sound crazy.

25:41.440 --> 25:44.410
You won't.
We saw it too.

25:45.760 --> 25:48.127
I think we should
talk to Hector again.

25:56.520 --> 25:59.091
Sean, Monroe
and I are at the shop.

25:59.200 --> 26:00.690
We need a little help.
What kind?

26:00.760 --> 26:04.287
We need to know the percentage of
Gypsum extract your mother used

26:04.400 --> 26:07.165
in relation to the Ferula
Tingitana and Combprecta.

26:07.280 --> 26:08.361
Think you got something?

26:08.440 --> 26:11.683
Yeah. Altering the
percentages of the potion

26:11.760 --> 26:13.728
in a retrograde
inversion may cause

26:13.840 --> 26:15.444
a betaubende Wirkung.

26:16.600 --> 26:18.728
Which translates
to numbing effect.

26:18.800 --> 26:20.165
I know what it means.

26:20.240 --> 26:22.242
And there's nothing
in the book on how to do that.

26:22.320 --> 26:24.129
You were with my mother when
she mixed the first batch.

26:24.200 --> 26:25.247
Don't you
remember what she did?

26:25.320 --> 26:27.527
She didn't tell us
how much she used.

26:27.600 --> 26:29.011
Yeah, she just...

26:29.080 --> 26:30.684
She just kinda did it.

26:30.800 --> 26:31.926
That's why this
could be so dangerous.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.606
Only a skilled Hexenbiest
should be attempting it.

26:34.720 --> 26:36.085
I can't get a hold of
my mother, I've tried.

26:36.160 --> 26:39.209
But there is somebody
who might be able to help us.

26:39.760 --> 26:42.286
Don't do anything
until I get back to you.

27:00.040 --> 27:01.041
Thanks.

27:03.440 --> 27:04.680
What would you like,
sir?

27:15.360 --> 27:16.566
Well.

27:17.600 --> 27:20.604
I must say, I never expected
to hear this from any of you.

27:22.680 --> 27:25.160
But from what
you're describing,

27:25.240 --> 27:27.368
it sounds like
this is what you saw.

27:28.040 --> 27:29.405
Yes.

27:29.480 --> 27:30.720
- Me too.
- Yeah.

27:30.800 --> 27:33.451
Well, this isn't
something I hear every day.

27:33.560 --> 27:36.291
What you're saying
you saw is a Mishipeshu,

27:36.360 --> 27:39.250
also known as
a Gichi-anami'e-bizhiw,

27:39.400 --> 27:41.562
or horned water
serpent-panther.

27:41.720 --> 27:43.449
How is it possible
that we all think

27:43.520 --> 27:45.602
we saw something
that doesn't exist?

27:48.280 --> 27:50.009
Really hard to believe.
Yeah.

27:50.080 --> 27:52.651
Reality is open
to interpretation.

27:52.760 --> 27:55.570
Uh, Mishipeshu is
a being that supposedly

27:55.640 --> 27:59.281
lives in the depths of the
Gitchigumi or Lake Superior.

27:59.360 --> 28:02.523
The stories are related
to the Anishinaabe tribes,

28:02.600 --> 28:05.444
the Odawa,
Potawatomi, and Ojibwe.

28:05.520 --> 28:08.091
McClay was attacked last night.
He's still alive.

28:08.160 --> 28:10.811
We were able to connect him
to Declan and Kilburn.

28:10.880 --> 28:13.611
Now all three victims knew each
other and had criminal records.

28:13.760 --> 28:16.001
We can connect
Kilburn to Simon.

28:16.080 --> 28:18.242
Is this something that could have
happened to Simon on his quest?

28:18.320 --> 28:20.482
You're suggesting
Simon has been possessed.

28:20.600 --> 28:23.285
We all saw the same thing.
Can you explain that?

28:23.360 --> 28:26.364
If the Mishipeshu
originated in Lake Superior,

28:26.440 --> 28:27.646
how does that
connect to Simon?

28:27.720 --> 28:31.008
Because the legend is related
to his mother. She was Ojibwe.

28:31.080 --> 28:32.570
So, you think
this is possible?

28:32.640 --> 28:35.211
It's a Power Quest,
he's entering another world,

28:35.280 --> 28:36.725
anything is possible.

28:37.280 --> 28:40.489
If you want to find him, you
have to know where he is going.

28:40.560 --> 28:41.607
How do we do that?

28:42.120 --> 28:44.407
By understanding
where he has been.

28:44.480 --> 28:47.290
To do that you must
enter the dream world.

29:13.040 --> 29:15.520
Yeah. Just want to bring
you up to speed, sir.

29:16.120 --> 29:17.929
We were able to
connect the three victims,

29:18.000 --> 29:20.002
all had records,
all knew each other.

29:20.080 --> 29:23.846
And it looks to me like we
got ourselves a Wesen crime.

29:24.120 --> 29:25.246
Mmm-hmm.

29:25.320 --> 29:26.685
That's good.

29:27.680 --> 29:30.684
Um, this isn't mine. I just
found it in my coat. Oh.

29:30.760 --> 29:32.603
Yeah, not sure
how it got there.

29:33.320 --> 29:36.210
Uh, well, maybe someone thought your
coat was their coat and put it in.

29:36.280 --> 29:38.647
Yeah, that's probably
how it happened. Um...

29:38.720 --> 29:41.963
Do me a favor, make sure
the owner gets that back.

29:42.120 --> 29:43.690
You just made
somebody's day.

29:44.480 --> 29:46.050
Let's keep it anonymous,
please.

29:46.120 --> 29:47.121
Mmm-hmm.

29:48.240 --> 29:50.049
Captain?
Yeah.

29:50.320 --> 29:51.845
May I ask you something?
Mmm-hmm.

29:53.720 --> 29:55.131
What percentage of
crime in Portland

29:55.200 --> 29:56.770
do you think
is Wesen-related?

29:56.840 --> 29:59.684
Like 20-30%?

30:00.000 --> 30:04.403
Well, one way or another, most crime
in most places is Wesen-related.

30:07.040 --> 30:08.201
Wow.

30:09.440 --> 30:10.521
Okay.

30:11.200 --> 30:12.201
Mmm-hmm.

30:17.240 --> 30:18.526
Grandfather,

30:19.080 --> 30:22.323
thank you for this good
red road that we travel.

30:29.920 --> 30:31.809
Don't worry,
it won't kill you.

30:35.120 --> 30:38.647
We ask that you grant us the
strength to enter the dream world,

30:38.760 --> 30:41.764
that we may find our brother
who has been lost there.

30:56.800 --> 30:57.961
No.

30:58.640 --> 31:02.281
Something about you. I didn't see
it before, but I feel it now.

31:03.840 --> 31:04.966
You're different.

31:08.280 --> 31:09.725
This could be
dangerous for you.

31:11.480 --> 31:13.840
Probably better that one of us
keeps his feet on the ground.

31:16.200 --> 31:17.440
This belongs to Simon.

31:18.120 --> 31:19.645
It was given to
him by his father.

31:25.040 --> 31:26.610
This belonged to
Simon's mother.

31:29.920 --> 31:33.367
These possessions
will help you find Simon.

32:28.800 --> 32:29.881
Where are you?

32:33.760 --> 32:35.285
I'm in a truck.

32:38.360 --> 32:39.771
My dad's truck.

32:44.720 --> 32:45.721
How old are you?

32:48.240 --> 32:49.651
I'm five and a half.

32:53.800 --> 32:55.245
Shouldn't have come
off the res, Chief!

32:55.320 --> 32:56.685
No pow wows here!

32:58.400 --> 33:01.085
Stop it! Stop it!

33:01.520 --> 33:03.170
Need a haircut.

33:03.760 --> 33:05.091
Braids...

33:10.320 --> 33:11.367
Is that your daddy?

33:11.600 --> 33:12.601
Stop hitting...

33:12.680 --> 33:13.841
They're killing my dad.

33:15.280 --> 33:17.760
They're killing my dad,
there's three of them.

33:19.360 --> 33:21.249
He's entered
into Simon's past.

33:21.840 --> 33:23.763
Three men killed
Simon's father.

33:27.600 --> 33:29.841
That's the connection

33:29.920 --> 33:31.490
between Declan,
Kilburn and McClay.

33:34.800 --> 33:36.086
I don't feel so good.

33:36.200 --> 33:37.770
She's getting too hot,
take her out.

33:52.200 --> 33:53.201
It's all right.

33:53.880 --> 33:55.041
I want you to come out.

33:57.800 --> 33:59.723
They killed him!

33:59.800 --> 34:01.131
They killed my dad!

34:02.160 --> 34:03.321
They killed my dad!

34:08.679 --> 34:09.726
Hank!

34:13.199 --> 34:14.201
What happened?

34:14.320 --> 34:15.367
He's still with Simon.

34:16.040 --> 34:17.246
Well, we need to find him.

34:26.600 --> 34:27.647
Stop it!

34:33.040 --> 34:34.201
Did you find him?

34:34.280 --> 34:35.327
No.

34:35.480 --> 34:36.880
But I think I know
where he's going.

34:37.040 --> 34:38.849
This is all
about Simon's father.

34:38.920 --> 34:40.684
There's only one
place Simon would be.

34:41.159 --> 34:44.562
Where his father is buried. It's on
the mountain. You can't drive there.

34:44.639 --> 34:46.608
We gotta go after him.

34:46.679 --> 34:48.284
Is he gonna get out of this?
Eventually.

34:48.320 --> 34:50.760
I'm coming with you. I'm coming with you.
No, you should stay.

34:55.159 --> 34:57.049
Stop it! Stop it!

34:59.480 --> 35:00.891
No pow wows here.

35:02.800 --> 35:04.290
That's a dead Indian,
boys.

35:52.400 --> 35:53.686
Simon is here.

35:55.920 --> 35:57.160
Where's Hank?

35:57.240 --> 35:58.401
Simon. It's me.

36:00.200 --> 36:02.407
Hector, what happened?

36:04.120 --> 36:06.248
I hurt it somehow.

36:08.800 --> 36:10.404
If it was in him,
it's gone now.

36:10.720 --> 36:12.006
So where is Hank?

36:12.440 --> 36:13.601
Look at the totem.

36:19.200 --> 36:20.690
Mishipeshu.

36:23.320 --> 36:24.731
Simon is injured.

36:26.520 --> 36:29.251
If Hank got here before we
did, it must be using him.

36:29.320 --> 36:30.446
To do what?

36:30.600 --> 36:33.331
Sometimes Mishipeshu
can be a protective creature.

36:34.760 --> 36:36.762
And sometimes it
could be a vengeful beast

36:36.880 --> 36:38.803
and it won't stop
until they're all dead.

36:40.360 --> 36:41.441
McClay is still alive.

36:43.160 --> 36:45.242
He helped murder
Simon's father.

36:45.320 --> 36:47.402
It's gonna go
finish what it started.

37:25.880 --> 37:27.848
You're no longer
needed here.

37:29.160 --> 37:31.003
We know who
killed Simon's father.

37:33.920 --> 37:35.843
What the hell's going on in there?
Shut up.

37:35.920 --> 37:37.445
Hey, it's my house.

37:38.680 --> 37:40.364
Hank.

37:48.200 --> 37:49.531
It's okay.

37:50.440 --> 37:51.601
We need to get you home.

37:51.680 --> 37:54.206
Hank! Hey, Hank!
It's me!

38:04.600 --> 38:05.726
Hank!

38:08.800 --> 38:10.131
Hank, no!

38:14.440 --> 38:17.171
Hank. It's me.

38:37.600 --> 38:38.726
Nick, what happened?

38:40.120 --> 38:42.122
The Mishipeshu
sort of borrowed you.

38:43.200 --> 38:44.440
What?
It's okay.

38:44.720 --> 38:46.529
You're all right now.

38:47.200 --> 38:48.406
Nick,

38:50.120 --> 38:51.246
I saw it.

38:53.240 --> 38:55.083
It's hard to explain.

38:56.080 --> 38:58.890
It's like I was
Simon when he was five.

39:02.120 --> 39:04.930
I saw the three men
that murdered Simon's father.

39:06.480 --> 39:07.925
Kilburn,

39:08.880 --> 39:11.087
Declan, McClay,
they beat him to death.

39:16.760 --> 39:18.603
It'll be okay.

39:32.760 --> 39:34.000
What happened?

39:34.080 --> 39:35.127
It's gone.

39:37.840 --> 39:38.841
You Okay?

39:38.920 --> 39:39.967
No.

39:47.720 --> 39:48.767
I know what you did.

39:48.840 --> 39:52.367
You and your two buddies,
Declan and Kilburn,

39:52.480 --> 39:54.244
beat Simon George's
father to death.

39:55.160 --> 39:56.764
How the hell
would you know that?

39:57.600 --> 39:59.090
I saw it.

39:59.160 --> 40:01.208
Sure you did.

40:01.320 --> 40:02.481
Good luck proving it.

40:04.960 --> 40:08.009
I don't know what you think
you're doing here.

40:08.080 --> 40:09.491
Get the hell out.

40:11.800 --> 40:13.689
All of you
get the hell out.

40:23.680 --> 40:25.560
Was that one of the men
that killed your father?

40:26.680 --> 40:27.761
Yeah.

40:30.000 --> 40:31.525
Let's get you
outta here.

40:37.160 --> 40:38.650
We should arrest
that son of a bitch.

40:39.680 --> 40:41.720
We have no physical evidence
tying him to the crime.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.401
No jury's gonna believe the
testimony of an 18-year-old

40:45.480 --> 40:47.120
who witnessed the murder
when he was five.

40:47.160 --> 40:48.127
If you take this to court,

40:48.200 --> 40:50.282
they could connect Simon
to the other two murders.

40:50.360 --> 40:51.930
That's not fair.

41:19.560 --> 41:21.244
I'm just trying to
be the best Hexenbiest I can.

41:21.320 --> 41:22.321
I could never
hurt you, Juliette.

41:22.400 --> 41:23.367
I wish I could
say the same.

41:23.440 --> 41:24.851
I do blame you for
what's happening.

41:24.960 --> 41:26.325
And I don't
want to give it up.

41:26.400 --> 41:29.768
We can't go back. I like this power, Nick.
And I know you do too...

41:29.880 --> 41:31.291
- Stop it!
- I can't!

41:31.360 --> 41:32.486
It's safer
for you in here.

41:32.560 --> 41:33.800
And safer for you.
