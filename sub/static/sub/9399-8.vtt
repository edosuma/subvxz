She has no right to take him from Lindsey.

Maybe it wasn't what it looked like.

Maybe it was just a friendly kiss
or maybe it was a good-bye kiss.

Maybe it was just a mistake.

06:28.654 --> 06:30.645
No, I know what I saw.

This was a full-on,
romantic Lucas/Peyton kiss.

06:36.329 --> 06:38.524
Then you should forget what you saw.

be man enough to tell her himself.

in New York, not one of them

07:10.163 --> 07:12.495

So I could sue you
for naming that shot after me.

07:30.917 --> 07:33.647
First of all, you named the shot
after yourself.

07:34.220 --> 07:37.189
Second of all, that shot was named
the Patricia Foster last week,

07:37.256 --> 07:38.917
the Liz Thompson the week before,

tomorrow night,

I should do real fast.

14:13.052 --> 14:15.350
That is greater than you know.

14:15.454 --> 14:18.321
So what happened? You think they found
out about how abusive she was, or...

14:18.390 --> 14:21.917
Not exactly. Apparently
she was sleeping with an employee.

14:21.994 --> 14:24.292
They're totally, like, cleaning house.

14:39.812 --> 14:42.542
Man, we ain't gonna never beat La Salle
if you gonna be late.

14:42.615 --> 14:45.584
Actually, we're never gonna beat La Salle,
even if you're on time.

14:45.651 --> 14:48.347
Well, maybe I should've spent last night
planning a strategy to win,

14:48.420 --> 14:50.388
instead of getting engaged, huh?

14:50.456 --> 14:51.718
Definitely.

14:52.992 --> 14:55.460
Wait, hold on.
Did you just say, "Engaged"?

14:55.527 --> 14:56.585
(CHUCKLING)

14:56.662 --> 14:59.460
Congratulations, big brother,
that's awesome.

14:59.531 --> 15:01.396
No doubt, baby. Way to go.

15:02.268 --> 15:04.259
So who's the lucky girl?

15:04.770 --> 15:06.635
- You're kidding, right?
- No, that's a legit question.

15:06.705 --> 15:09.299
I mean, we figure with Peyton back
in town, it could be anybody's ballgame.

15:09.375 --> 15:11.866
- Could even be Brooke by now, right?
- Stop.

15:12.311 --> 15:13.835
It's Lindsey.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.175
Excellent choice.

15:15.247 --> 15:17.579
Looks like things might work out
for you after all.

15:17.816 --> 15:18.805
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

15:22.354 --> 15:23.878
Maybe not.

15:25.557 --> 15:29.220
You see what I'm talking about?
You can't just hit people.

15:29.295 --> 15:31.889
Man, all I know is Mrs. James Scott
needed somebody to defend her honor,

15:31.964 --> 15:33.898
and her own husband wasn't
man enough to do it.

15:33.966 --> 15:35.263
Let me tell you something.

15:35.334 --> 15:37.427
My wife's honor is not something
that can be taken away

15:37.503 --> 15:39.630
by some loudmouth jackass in a bar.

15:40.739 --> 15:43.230
What can be taken away
is your ability to play.

15:43.309 --> 15:44.970
It looks like it's just a sprain.

15:45.044 --> 15:47.239
Could be a few days, could be a month.

15:47.313 --> 15:50.441
That's just great.
That's a hell of a punch, Q.

15:50.516 --> 15:52.507
You might have taken out
a whole team with it.

16:00.726 --> 16:01.920
Hi.

16:02.494 --> 16:06.123
If you wanted to break my heart,
there are a thousand ways you could do it.

16:07.166 --> 16:10.727
You did not have to
propose to Lindsey to hurt me.

16:12.905 --> 16:15.203
It didn't have anything to do with you.

16:16.075 --> 16:18.236
It was just weird timing.

16:19.144 --> 16:22.113
Weird timing. Okay, Luke.

16:24.516 --> 16:28.213
- I know that it must seem like...
- No, don't marry her, Luke!

16:29.121 --> 16:31.715
- Peyton, you can't...
- Am I crazy?

16:32.858 --> 16:34.553
Do you not feel what I have felt

16:34.626 --> 16:36.651
every day that we've been apart
for the last three years?

16:36.729 --> 16:42.099
Because I have felt there is this vital piece
of me that's been missing.

16:42.568 --> 16:43.694
And I tried to fill it, Luke.

16:43.769 --> 16:48.570
I tried to fill it with work
and friends and music.

16:49.108 --> 16:52.509
And it stayed empty until last night
when you kissed me,

16:52.745 --> 16:55.908
and my entire universe
snapped back into focus.

16:57.916 --> 17:00.009
Lucas, look me in the eye

17:00.085 --> 17:01.416
and tell me that that kiss did not feel

17:01.487 --> 17:04.285
exactly the same as it felt three years ago.

17:08.627 --> 17:10.288
I'm in love with her, Peyton.

17:15.233 --> 17:16.861
What is going on here?

17:18.069 --> 17:21.597
Just congratulating Luke.

17:22.273 --> 17:23.866
Did you hear he's engaged?

17:24.009 --> 17:26.772
Yeah, I'm gonna be her matron of honor.

17:33.118 --> 17:35.678
Luke, I need to talk to you alone.

17:55.240 --> 17:57.208
Something you want to tell me?

17:58.777 --> 18:00.108
Is this a trick question?

18:00.179 --> 18:03.637
Luke, marriage is a huge commitment.

18:03.715 --> 18:06.843
Can you honestly tell me
that you're positive Lindsey's the one?

18:06.919 --> 18:09.979
Okay, I know where this is going.
Tell you the truth...

18:10.422 --> 18:12.652
Lindsey will always be my number two.

18:14.026 --> 18:17.621
But only because you are my number one.

18:17.696 --> 18:19.391
And you always will be.
Just don't tell Lindsey or Nathan.

18:19.465 --> 18:22.195
Lucas, marriage is serious, and you better
be ready to commit to Lindsey

18:22.267 --> 18:23.859
for the rest of your life.

18:27.372 --> 18:29.533
Does that mean you're happy for me?

18:29.975 --> 18:33.934
<i>WOMAN ON TV:</i>
<i>Get the doctor! Get the doctor! Nurse.</i>

18:34.146 --> 18:35.875
Mama said no TV.

18:35.948 --> 18:36.972
<i>NURSE ON TV: She's at 125 over 70.</i>

18:37.049 --> 18:39.347
Shh. What mama doesn't know
won't hurt her.

18:39.418 --> 18:43.377
<i>NURSE ON TV: She's okay. We've set</i>

18:45.023 --> 18:47.514
Let me know if Adrian tells Lexine
they harvested the wrong lung.

18:47.593 --> 18:49.322
You know he's going to.

18:53.599 --> 18:55.260
Can I help you?

18:55.334 --> 18:57.234
Looking for a gift for this girl I know.

18:57.302 --> 18:59.770
Well, you've definitely
come to the right place.

18:59.838 --> 19:01.738
What's this girl look like?

19:01.807 --> 19:03.866
Dark hair, hazel eyes.

19:06.712 --> 19:10.614
If she didn't already own it,
I bet she'd like this one.

19:11.550 --> 19:15.919
Yeah, but she's a little taller than you,
so, you have any other sizes?

19:15.988 --> 19:17.751
Brooke, it's Victoria.

19:17.823 --> 19:20.519
She's setting a meeting for you
with a furrier.

19:21.860 --> 19:23.589
One sec.

19:24.963 --> 19:27.523
Apparently, furs are about to make
an unprecedented comeback.

19:27.599 --> 19:29.590
Really? Jamie, cover your ears.

19:30.536 --> 19:32.766
Hi, let's make this short and sweet.

19:32.838 --> 19:37.207
There is no situation in which I am
going to kill furry woodland creatures

19:37.276 --> 19:40.473
to make coats out of them, okay? Thanks.

19:43.348 --> 19:46.442
Let me guess.
Bar hag's still calling the shots?

19:47.519 --> 19:50.784
Aren't you supposed to be shopping
for some fugly giantess?

19:51.056 --> 19:54.787
I'm just saying, why do you work with her
if she makes you that crazy?

19:54.927 --> 19:58.658
Well, first of all, the bar hag,
as you call her, is my mother.

19:58.730 --> 20:01.426
And second of all,
she's my business partner.

20:01.500 --> 20:04.094
And if it weren't for her, I wouldn't have
a bazillion-dollar company,

20:04.169 --> 20:06.660
a magazine and all these lovely clothes
you see here.

20:07.606 --> 20:11.440
My mother wanted me to be
an orthodontist, but I just said no.

20:11.877 --> 20:15.108
Judging from your car,
maybe you should have reconsidered.

20:16.081 --> 20:17.912
Jab against my car.

20:18.483 --> 20:20.041
You're that girl, huh?

20:22.921 --> 20:24.616
That's disappointing.

20:31.129 --> 20:33.962
What's underneath all the clothes,
Brooke Davis?

20:43.842 --> 20:48.074
Hey, Peyton, it's me, Molly.
I live in your old bedroom...

20:48.146 --> 20:50.774
Right, right, keeper of my closet door, hey.

20:50.849 --> 20:53.477
If I'd known other people would be reading
everything I wrote on that thing,

20:53.552 --> 20:55.042
I probably would have been more careful.

20:55.120 --> 20:56.678
Well, I'm glad you weren't.

20:56.755 --> 21:01.215
I wanted to ask, did Lucas really carry you
out of the library after you got shot?

21:01.627 --> 21:03.561
Yeah.

21:03.795 --> 21:05.228
That must have been so romantic.

21:05.297 --> 21:09.324
Well, I was actually kind of preoccupied,
bleeding out on the library carpet, so...

21:09.401 --> 21:11.198
Didn't really think about that.

21:11.270 --> 21:14.933
I don't really remember writing
that part down on my closet doors.

21:18.443 --> 21:22.311
- Oh, right. Of course.
- I've read it 13 times. Is that weird?

21:22.381 --> 21:24.747
Well, it's just that,
when we moved into our new house

21:24.816 --> 21:27.512
and I read your closet door,
I knew it was special.

21:27.586 --> 21:29.451
Then I read this book.

21:29.521 --> 21:32.979
And I realized
I was part of this timeless love story.

21:33.058 --> 21:35.788
The truth is, sometimes I read that door
and I imagine

21:35.861 --> 21:37.522
that I have your life instead of mine.

21:37.596 --> 21:40.793
No, Molly, I am not someone you want to
live vicariously through, okay?

21:40.866 --> 21:42.663
I'm... I'm a mess.

21:42.734 --> 21:44.599
Lucas Scott didn't think so.

21:45.137 --> 21:49.096
Besides, even if you are,
no one's ever gonna write about my life.

21:57.182 --> 21:58.809
(CLEARS THROAT)

21:58.884 --> 22:02.251
- It's Marvin, right?
- Yes, sir.

22:03.322 --> 22:05.449
I suppose you heard
we had to fire Alice Day

22:05.524 --> 22:08.891
for carrying on an inappropriate
relationship with a subordinate.

22:10.662 --> 22:13.460
I suppose you know
a little something about that.

22:14.399 --> 22:16.526
- Yes, sir. I...
- It's okay, son.

22:16.835 --> 22:20.464
Apparently, half the station
knew about Alice and Rick.

22:20.539 --> 22:21.836
Rick?

22:23.975 --> 22:25.306
Evening news anchorman Rick?

22:25.377 --> 22:30.906
I know. Programming Director
sleeping with her anchor? Oh, boy.

22:30.982 --> 22:33.849
Competition's gonna love that, huh?

22:34.219 --> 22:38.747
I'm sorry, Rick, with the...
With the toupée, Rick?

22:38.924 --> 22:41.222
Listen, Marvin,
we're in a bit of a scramble here.

22:41.293 --> 22:43.989
We're gonna need all hands on deck.

22:44.129 --> 22:45.994
I watched your audition tape.

22:46.665 --> 22:51.193
It's good. You know, the Tree Hill Ravens
have their season opener coming up.

22:51.470 --> 22:53.461
How would you like to cover it?

22:55.240 --> 22:57.299
Yes, sir. Yes.

22:57.376 --> 22:59.469
- Good man.
- Thank you.

22:59.878 --> 23:02.711
McFadden, word of advice?

23:03.048 --> 23:07.144
There's opportunity here for a kid
who'll work hard and keep his nose clean.

23:08.353 --> 23:09.820
Yes, sir.

23:15.327 --> 23:17.488
What did they say?
Do they know about Carlton?

23:17.562 --> 23:20.554
- What about Carlton?
- He was giving it to Alice.

23:20.632 --> 23:21.724
What, you didn't know?

23:21.800 --> 23:23.700
They said she was sleeping with Rick.

23:23.769 --> 23:27.899
Really? Wait, wait, wait.
Anchorman Rick with the toupée?

23:27.973 --> 23:29.065
Ew!

23:29.141 --> 23:31.473
- So she was sleeping with Carlton, too?
- Oh, yeah.

23:31.543 --> 23:32.669
(SCOFFS)

23:32.744 --> 23:36.111
Hey, Mouth. They didn't say anything
about me, did they?

23:36.181 --> 23:37.842
No, why would they say...

23:38.183 --> 23:39.309
You were sleeping with her, too?

23:39.384 --> 23:41.579
Just a few mornings before work.

23:43.989 --> 23:46.549
Rick? I mean, that... That's just nasty.

23:51.963 --> 23:53.624
You ready?

23:55.066 --> 23:57.091
Okay, we're rolling.

Haley, did I do something to upset you?

24:12.617 --> 24:15.108
You mean besides lying and cheating?

24:15.620 --> 24:17.087
Excuse me?

24:17.689 --> 24:19.452
You told me you weren't back for Lucas.

24:19.524 --> 24:20.548
(SIGHING)

24:20.625 --> 24:22.422
- I'm not.
- That's the lying.

24:22.894 --> 24:25.829
- Haley...
- You kissed him last night. I saw you.

24:26.731 --> 24:27.891
And that's the cheating.

24:27.966 --> 24:30.491
And now I have to be the matron
of honor to a really sweet girl

24:30.569 --> 24:33.936
whose fiancé is hooking up
with his old girlfriend behind her back.

24:34.005 --> 24:37.532
So, yeah, I know we're friends, but, yeah,
Peyton, you did something to upset me.

24:37.609 --> 24:39.372
And that should upset you.

24:40.579 --> 24:42.444
(BREATHING DEEPLY)

24:43.949 --> 24:45.507
Okay, listen.

24:46.585 --> 24:50.316
You said, "No," Peyton,
and Lindsey said, "Yes."

24:51.389 --> 24:53.584
I said, "Someday."

24:54.359 --> 24:56.919
Well, Lucas fell in love in the meantime.

24:57.996 --> 25:00.760
You gotta stop trying
to take that away from him.

He mixes drinks for a living.

Brooke Penelope Davis.

25:58.156 --> 25:59.487
Exactly!

26:00.191 --> 26:03.922
Besides, what has he ever even said
to make me think he's worth my time?

26:03.995 --> 26:06.930
"What's underneath all the clothes,
Brooke Davis?"

26:08.433 --> 26:10.264

26:29.154 --> 26:30.781
Well, I hope this does the trick.

26:30.855 --> 26:32.288
Fingers crossed.

26:33.124 --> 26:36.685
Millicent, you never called me back,
so I thought I'd swing by.

26:36.761 --> 26:38.820
Actually, I didn't call back on purpose.

26:38.897 --> 26:40.888
Oh, can I ask why?

26:40.966 --> 26:42.365
I don't think we're a good match.

26:42.434 --> 26:45.767
I mean, you like sports,
and I like ballet, so there's that.

26:45.837 --> 26:48.362
That's, like, the worst reason
I've ever heard.

26:48.440 --> 26:52.206
Then how about you like having sex
with your boss, and I like ballet?

26:52.677 --> 26:54.042
Brooke told me.
