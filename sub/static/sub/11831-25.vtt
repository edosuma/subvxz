WEBVTT

00:03.399 --> 00:06.299
THERE WAS A MESSAGE
ON THE MACHINE.

00:06.366 --> 00:08.399
SOME SCIENTIST
AND A MONKEY.

00:08.466 --> 00:10.099
I CALLED BACK
AND SET AN APPOINTMENT.

00:10.166 --> 00:13.299
HA HA.
YES, A REAL MONKEY.

00:13.366 --> 00:15.332
NAH, NAH,
SHE DIDN'T SAY.

00:15.399 --> 00:17.366
NAH. WE HAVE--
[GASPS]

00:35.099 --> 00:36.732
ARE YOU OK?

00:36.799 --> 00:38.499
YEAH, I'M FINE.

00:48.666 --> 00:49.866
THANKS.

00:53.766 --> 00:55.532
HOW YA DOIN', MA'AM?

00:55.599 --> 00:57.632
YOU WANNA MAKE
SOME MONEY TODAY?

00:57.699 --> 00:58.632
EXCUSE ME?

00:58.699 --> 01:01.932
GET YOU 4,000 OR 5,000.
MAYBE MORE. INSURANCE.

01:01.999 --> 01:03.466
I'M FINE, THANK YOU.

01:03.532 --> 01:05.032
THEY'LL PAY.
THEY GOTTA PAY.

01:05.099 --> 01:06.899
LOOK, I SAID
I'M NOT HURT.

01:06.966 --> 01:08.632
YEAH, BUT YOU NEVER KNOW.
SOFT TISSUE DAMAGE.

01:08.699 --> 01:10.166
THAT COULD BE
A DELAYED REACTION THING.

01:10.232 --> 01:12.066
NOW, MY MAN HERE--
HE'S GOOD.

01:12.132 --> 01:13.966
HE'LL CHECK YOU OUT,
AND IN 6 MONTHS,

01:14.032 --> 01:15.599
GET YOU UP TO 5,000.

01:15.666 --> 01:19.499
IT'S FREE MONEY.
JUST THINK ABOUT IT.

01:22.399 --> 01:24.699
IT'S A SCAM.
THE WHOLE ACCIDENT
WAS PROBABLY STAGED.

01:24.766 --> 01:25.966
YOU THINK?

01:26.032 --> 01:27.699
EXCEPT YOU WERE THE ONE MEANT
TO PLOW INTO THE GUY IN FRONT.

01:27.766 --> 01:29.966
THEN THEY COME AFTER
YOUR INSURANCE.

01:30.032 --> 01:31.966
SINCE YOU DIDN'T
HIT NOBODY, PLAN B.

01:32.032 --> 01:33.432
PLAN B?

01:33.499 --> 01:36.266
THEY SOLICIT YOU
TO GO AFTER THE GUY
WHO REAR-ENDED YOU.

01:36.332 --> 01:37.732
IT'S A BILLION-DOLLAR
BUSINESS--

01:37.799 --> 01:39.299
INSURANCE FRAUD.

01:39.366 --> 01:41.932
I ALMOST DECIDED
TO GO INTO IT.

01:41.999 --> 01:42.832
THAT WAS A JOKE.

01:42.899 --> 01:45.666
IT'S NOT A JOKE TO ME.
I'M REPORTING THEM.

01:45.732 --> 01:47.232
REPORTING WHO?

01:47.299 --> 01:48.566
THE GUILTY ONES
FLED THE SCENE.

01:48.632 --> 01:50.499
THE GUY WHO HIT YOU
IS PROBABLY AN INNOCENT.

01:50.566 --> 01:51.732
YOU GET ANY OTHER
PLATE NUMBERS?

01:51.799 --> 01:53.132
WHAT ABOUT THE GUY
THAT GAVE ME THIS CARD?

01:53.199 --> 01:54.166
YOU GET
HIS NAME?

01:54.232 --> 01:55.132
NO. I GOT
HIS DOCTOR'S NAME.

01:55.199 --> 01:56.732
YOU CAN'T PROVE
HE DID ANYTHING.

01:56.799 --> 01:57.599
MY CAR GOT BASHED.

01:57.666 --> 01:59.099
I'M TAKING THIS OUT
ON SOMEBODY.

01:59.166 --> 02:00.466
MAYBE ANOTHER RAT
WILL RUN BY.

02:00.532 --> 02:02.799
YOU THINK THAT'S FUNNY?
NO, NO. YOU WOULDN'T
KILL A RAT.

02:02.866 --> 02:04.199
PROFESSIONAL COURTESY.

02:04.266 --> 02:05.532
HEY...
ALL RIGHT.

02:05.599 --> 02:06.832
WOULD YOU STOP SAYING
ALL RIGHT, BIG HEAD?

02:06.899 --> 02:09.232
MY CAR GOT BASHED.
THERE'S NOTHING
ALL RIGHT WITH THAT.

02:09.299 --> 02:10.366
KNOW WHAT, REBECCA?

02:10.431 --> 02:12.532
I THINK YOU NEED TO HAVE
SEXUAL RELATIONS.

02:12.599 --> 02:14.199
WHAT?
YOU'VE BEEN
ACTING NASTY.

02:14.266 --> 02:15.632
I HAVE NOT
BEEN ACTING NASTY.

02:15.699 --> 02:17.499
MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE
A FRUSTRATED OLDER WOMAN.

02:17.566 --> 02:19.599
OLDER WOMAN?!
WHO YOU CALLIN'--

02:19.666 --> 02:23.232
YOU THINK I'M OLD?
DOES THIS LOOK OLD
TO YOU?

02:23.299 --> 02:25.432
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOIN' ON HERE?

02:25.499 --> 02:27.099
REBECCA GOT INTO
A CAR ACCIDENT,

02:27.166 --> 02:28.299
JIMMY CALLED HER OLD,

02:28.366 --> 02:29.766
AND I THINK HE WANTS
TO HAVE SEX WITH HER.

02:29.832 --> 02:31.799
NOT TRUE.
I'M INNOCENT.

02:31.866 --> 02:32.899
NOT TRUE.

03:23.199 --> 03:25.232
REBECCA, I WASN'T
SOLICITING YOU FOR SEX.

03:25.299 --> 03:26.632
THIS IS SOMETHING
I WOULDN'T DO.

03:26.699 --> 03:27.865
'CAUSE YOU THINK
I'M TOO OLD.

03:27.932 --> 03:30.032
I NEVER MEANT THAT, EITHER.
YOU KNOW I DIDN'T.

03:30.099 --> 03:31.199
I'M A KIND PERSON.

03:31.265 --> 03:33.032
YEAH. YOU HAVE A HEART
THE SIZE OF YOUR HEAD.

03:33.099 --> 03:34.199
CAN WE JUST DROP THIS?

03:34.265 --> 03:35.299
RUDE.

03:35.365 --> 03:36.565
IS THERE SOMETHING
IN THE WATER?

03:36.632 --> 03:38.265
YEAH, LINDSAY.

03:38.332 --> 03:39.432
BITE ME.

03:39.499 --> 03:40.465
ALL RIGHT,
THAT'S IT.

03:40.532 --> 03:42.132
AFTER LUNCH, 1:00,
STAFF MEETING.

03:42.199 --> 03:43.032
EVERYBODY THERE.

03:44.665 --> 03:48.132
EXCUSE ME. I'M LOOKING
FOR ELLENOR FRUTT.

03:48.199 --> 03:49.332
THAT'S ME.

03:49.399 --> 03:51.399
MY NAME IS
KATHERINE NESBIT.

03:51.465 --> 03:53.132
I CALLED.

03:53.199 --> 03:54.499
IT'S THE MONKEY.

03:57.099 --> 03:58.799
SHE GREW UP WITH US.

03:58.865 --> 04:00.932
I'VE BEEN HER TEACHER
ALMOST FROM BIRTH.

04:00.999 --> 04:02.532
BUT SHE DOESN'T
BELONG TO YOU.

04:02.599 --> 04:04.899
NO. SHE'S OWNED
BY THE PRIMATE CENTER.

04:04.965 --> 04:08.632
ELLENOR, YOU'LL UNDERSTAND WHY
I FEEL SO STRONGLY ABOUT THIS.

04:08.699 --> 04:13.099
HERE. YOU MIGHT WANT
ONE OF THESE.

04:15.265 --> 04:16.964
Dr. Nesbit: HI, TINA.

04:17.031 --> 04:19.132
GOOD MORNING.

04:19.199 --> 04:21.298
HI.

04:21.365 --> 04:23.232
HI, TINA.

04:24.465 --> 04:25.699
WHAT'S UP?

04:28.899 --> 04:30.399
SHE JUST ASKED
IF I WAS HER FRIEND.

04:30.465 --> 04:31.965
I KNOW SIGN LANGUAGE.

04:32.032 --> 04:33.232
YEAH, I KNOW THAT.

04:34.765 --> 04:36.232
MY NAME IS ELLENOR.

04:37.665 --> 04:39.832
Dr. Nesbit:
THAT'S HER SIGN NAME.

04:39.899 --> 04:42.832
HI, TINA. IT'S NICE
TO MEET YOU.

04:45.532 --> 04:47.965
I CAN'T BELIEVE
SHE KNOWS SIGN LANGUAGE.

04:48.032 --> 04:48.799
MODIFIED.

04:48.865 --> 04:51.165
SHE USES UP TO
130 SIGNS,

04:51.232 --> 04:53.665
AND SHE KNOWS
A HUNDRED OR SO
MORE THAN THAT.

04:54.665 --> 04:57.132
THE BEAR--CAN YOU
BRING IT TO ME?

05:01.032 --> 05:02.565
THANK YOU.

05:06.932 --> 05:08.265
REBECCA...

05:10.465 --> 05:12.899
YOU AND I NEED TO CLEAR
SOME AIR.

05:12.965 --> 05:14.232
NO.

05:14.299 --> 05:16.132
I WAS...

05:17.232 --> 05:18.799
THE ACCIDENT.

05:18.865 --> 05:21.799
THE THOUGHT THAT
THEY DID IT ON PURPOSE.

05:21.865 --> 05:23.565
I COULD'VE BEEN KILLED.

05:23.632 --> 05:25.965
YOU REALLY
WANNA GET THEM?

05:26.032 --> 05:27.365
CAN WE?

05:27.432 --> 05:30.232
LET ME SEE THE CARD
THAT GUY GAVE YOU.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.599
LIKE A STING.

05:33.665 --> 05:35.665
JUST THE DOCTOR.
NOTHING DANGEROUS.

05:35.732 --> 05:38.199
DO YOU REALLY THINK
THE ACCIDENT WAS STAGED?

05:38.265 --> 05:40.799
ALL I KNOW IS THAT
THE CAR ON THE LEFT
WAS BLOCKING ME,

05:40.865 --> 05:42.365
AND THE CAR
IN FRONT OF ME
STOPPED SHORT

05:42.432 --> 05:43.465
THEN TOOK OFF.

05:43.532 --> 05:44.799
THAT'S HOW
THEY DO IT.

05:44.865 --> 05:46.865
THEN THE MAN WITH
THE DOCTOR'S CARD
SUDDENLY APPEARS.

05:46.932 --> 05:49.732
YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE
TO WEAR A WIRE.

05:49.799 --> 05:51.565
THE GUY WOULD
BE EXAMINING YOU.

05:51.632 --> 05:53.765
I MAKE FOR
A GOOD WITNESS,
REMEMBER?

05:57.365 --> 05:58.565
ARE YOU NUTS?

05:58.632 --> 05:59.932
I'D ONLY BE MEETING
THE CHIROPRACTOR.

05:59.999 --> 06:01.765
WHAT DOCTORS
AREN'T DANGEROUS
IF THEY'RE CRIMINALS?

06:01.832 --> 06:03.232
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

06:03.299 --> 06:04.265
BITE ME.

06:04.332 --> 06:05.565
NOW WHAT?

06:05.632 --> 06:08.432
REBECCA,
A.K.A. PAM GRIER,
IS GOING UNDERCOVER

06:08.499 --> 06:09.865
TO BREAK
AN INSURANCE FRAUD RING.

06:09.932 --> 06:10.732
WHAT?

06:10.799 --> 06:11.899
THEY ALMOST
GOT ME KILLED.

06:11.965 --> 06:13.165
REBECCA...
DON'T REBECCA ME.

06:13.232 --> 06:14.732
THEY PICKED THE WRONG TARGET
THIS MORNING.

06:14.799 --> 06:16.365
BOBBY, LISTEN.
I ALREADY SAID YES.

06:16.432 --> 06:17.932
IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM,
BITE HER.

06:17.999 --> 06:20.832
IT'S JUST A MEETING
WITH THE DOCTOR.

06:24.032 --> 06:26.565
WHY ARE THEY
GETTING RID OF HER?

06:26.632 --> 06:27.665
IT'S NOT JUST TINA.

06:27.732 --> 06:30.165
THE PRIMATE CENTER
CLOSES ON THURSDAY.

06:30.232 --> 06:31.299
ALL
THE RESEARCH ANIMALS

06:31.365 --> 06:33.499
HAVE BEEN SOLD
TO A BIOMEDICAL LAB.

06:33.565 --> 06:35.499
AND AT THE BIOMEDICAL LAB,
TINA...

06:35.565 --> 06:38.365
EXACTLY.
THEY'LL PROBABLY
EXPERIMENT ON HER,

06:38.432 --> 06:39.965
MAYBE HER BRAIN.

06:40.032 --> 06:44.099
THERE'S A LIKELIHOOD
THEY'LL EVEN K-I-L-L.

06:44.165 --> 06:47.699
I DON'T THINK
SHE'S LISTENING,
BUT JUST IN CASE.

06:47.765 --> 06:49.299
SHE KNOWS THAT WORD.

06:49.365 --> 06:53.232
I DON'T KNOW.
WE CAN TRY AND GET
A TEMPORARY INJUNCTION.

06:53.299 --> 06:55.965
MISS FRUTT,
I REALLY DON'T HAVE
A LOT OF MONEY.

06:56.032 --> 06:57.232
DO YOU HAVE A HOUSE?

06:58.432 --> 06:59.732
I'M KIDDING.

06:59.799 --> 07:03.332
FIRST OF ALL, THE IDEA
OF A PARTNERSHIP OR EQUITY--

07:03.399 --> 07:05.665
I'M NOT SURE IT'S SOMETHING
ANY OF YOU REALLY WANT.

07:05.732 --> 07:07.399
YOU DON'T JUST
SHARE THE PROFIT,
YOU SHARE THE DEBT,

07:07.465 --> 07:08.732
WHICH WE STILL HAVE.

07:08.799 --> 07:10.465
THAT DEBT CAN BE ERASED
BY A BUY-IN.

07:10.532 --> 07:12.632
IF WE
BUY INTO THE PARTNERSHIP,
THAT WOULD CREATE A SURPLUS

07:12.699 --> 07:15.599
THAT COULD WIPE OUT
MOST OF OUR DEFICITS.

07:15.665 --> 07:16.599
PLUS, IN EXCHANGE
FOR EQUITY,

07:16.665 --> 07:18.732
WE COULD ALL AGREE
TO REDUCE OUR SALARIES.

07:18.799 --> 07:19.765
THAT WOULD
LOWER OVERHEAD.

07:19.832 --> 07:22.365
PROBLEM IS, I CAN'T
AFFORD TO MAKE LESS.

07:22.432 --> 07:23.832
I BARELY CRACK MY NUT
AS IT IS.

07:23.899 --> 07:25.132
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO BUY IN, EUGENE.

07:25.199 --> 07:26.565
IT'S NOT LIKE ANYBODY'S
HAND'S BEING FORCED.

07:26.632 --> 07:28.332
YES, BUT IF YOU
BUY IN, LINDSAY,

07:28.399 --> 07:29.832
WHICH MAYBE
YOU CAN AFFORD

07:29.899 --> 07:31.399
SINCE YOU DON'T PAY
CHILD SUPPORT,

07:31.465 --> 07:33.032
YOU BECOME A PARTNER,
DON'T YOU?

07:33.099 --> 07:34.532
MEANING?

07:34.599 --> 07:36.665
MEANING YOU'D BE IN A POSITION
TO FORCE HANDS.

07:36.732 --> 07:37.799
THIS ISN'T
ABOUT POWER.

07:37.865 --> 07:38.832
OH, DON'T GIVE ME THAT.

07:38.899 --> 07:40.099
THIS HAS
NOTHING TO DO--

07:40.165 --> 07:41.632
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A SAY
IN HOW THIS PLACE IS RUN.

07:41.699 --> 07:42.732
ARE YOU GONNA DENY THAT?

07:42.799 --> 07:44.065
THAT DOESN'T
TRANSLATE TO POWER.

07:44.132 --> 07:46.799
COME ON. LET'S NOT DENY
THIS IS A LITTLE ABOUT POWER.

07:46.865 --> 07:48.399
IT COULD BE MORE THAT
SHE SLEPT WITH HIM.

07:48.465 --> 07:49.599
SHUT UP.

07:49.665 --> 07:50.599
JIMMY, FOR CRYIN'
OUT LOUD...

07:50.665 --> 07:51.799
THIS IS ABOUT
PROMOTING THE FIRM.

07:51.865 --> 07:52.999
AND PROMOTING YOURSELF
WITHIN THE FIRM.

07:53.065 --> 07:54.132
TO HELP EVERYBODY!

07:54.199 --> 07:55.399
YEAH, INCLUDING YOURSELF.

07:55.465 --> 07:56.932
YOU GONNA DENY THAT, TOO?

07:56.999 --> 07:58.365
ARE YOU GONNA DENY
YOU'RE FRUSTRATED?

07:58.432 --> 07:59.532
DO YOU HEAR ME COMPLAIN?

07:59.599 --> 08:00.632
I DON'T HAVE TO.

08:00.699 --> 08:02.032
A FRIEND OF MINE WORKS
AT HARRICK AND DUNNE.

08:02.099 --> 08:03.732
YOU INTERVIEWED THERE
LAST WEEK FOR A JOB.

08:09.365 --> 08:12.632
THAT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH THIS.

08:12.699 --> 08:16.099
I AM DUE IN COURT.
I HAVE TO GO SAVE AN APE.

08:21.132 --> 08:22.799
HAVEN'T WE MOVED UP?

08:22.865 --> 08:24.232
WE REPRESENT MONKEYS NOW.

08:24.299 --> 08:28.032
BUT, HEY, SO LONG AS EUGENE
GETS TO CRACK HIS NUTS.

08:29.565 --> 08:31.999
NO PROBLEMS HERE.

08:34.999 --> 08:36.565
[DOOR CLOSES]

08:40.099 --> 08:42.099
TIGHTNESS HERE...

08:42.164 --> 08:43.698
AND HERE.

08:43.765 --> 08:45.665
I'M NOT IN ANY PAIN.

08:45.732 --> 08:47.599
RIGHT. COULD YOU PUSH UP
AGAINST ME, PLEASE?

08:47.665 --> 08:50.632
NO. THIS REALLY HURTS.

08:50.699 --> 08:52.665
IT'S ALMOST LIKE
A BURNING SENSATION.

08:52.732 --> 08:54.965
SEE, THE WHOLE BACK AREA
IS SPASMING.

08:55.032 --> 08:58.665
SEE, THE PAIN RADIATES
OUT FROM THE SPINAL COLUMN

08:58.732 --> 09:00.065
LIKE A STARFISH,
YOU'LL WANT TO SAY,

09:00.132 --> 09:02.432
OR LIKE ARROWS,
BUT WE'LL GO OVER THAT.

09:02.499 --> 09:04.899
UH, MARCUS SAID
4,000 OR 5,000.

09:04.965 --> 09:05.799
JUST A SECOND.

09:05.865 --> 09:08.899
ALISON, COULD YOU
COME IN HERE, PLEASE?

09:08.965 --> 09:11.199
NEED TO SEE YOU
A NUMBER OF TIMES.

09:11.265 --> 09:12.965
SET UP A PATTERN
OF TREATMENT.

09:13.032 --> 09:14.599
WITH THIS TYPE OF
SOFT TISSUE INFLAMMATION,

09:14.665 --> 09:15.932
IT COULD TAKE SEVERAL MONTHS
TO TREAT.

09:15.999 --> 09:17.799
I UNDERSTAND.

09:17.865 --> 09:19.932
OK. WE'RE GONNA START
MS. WASHINGTON ON A ROUTINE

09:19.999 --> 09:22.565
OF 3 TIMES A WEEK
FOR THE FIRST MONTH.

09:22.632 --> 09:24.965
I'LL JUST HAVE YOU SIGN IN
FOR THE FIRST 5 WEEKS NOW,

09:25.032 --> 09:26.965
AND THEN I'LL SEE YOU
IN JUST OVER A MONTH.

09:27.032 --> 09:28.765
OK.

09:28.832 --> 09:32.199
YOU'RE GONNA NEED A LAWYER
TO SUBMIT YOUR CLAIM.

09:32.265 --> 09:33.799
I HAVE A NUMBER OF NAMES.

09:33.865 --> 09:36.565
I'M ACTUALLY
THE OFFICE MANAGER
OF A SMALL LAW FIRM.

09:36.632 --> 09:37.932
I'M SURE ONE OF
OUR ATTORNEYS

09:37.999 --> 09:39.232
WOULD BE GLAD
TO HANDLE THIS
FOR ME.

09:39.299 --> 09:41.165
YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.

09:41.232 --> 09:43.699
UH...INSURANCE LAW
CAN BE A TRICKY BUSINESS.

09:43.765 --> 09:45.465
YOU WANT SOMEBODY WHO CAN
HANDLE THIS KIND OF THING.

09:45.532 --> 09:49.465
WELL, ACTUALLY,
THIS "KIND OF THING"
IS RIGHT UP OUR ALLEY.

09:49.532 --> 09:51.199
REALLY?

09:51.265 --> 09:55.032
HUH. THAT'S SOMETHING
WE MIGHT WANNA
TALK ABOUT SOMETIME.

09:56.332 --> 09:57.699
OK.

10:05.707 --> 10:07.307
I DON'T GET THE POINT.
YOUR CLIENT DOESN'T
OWN THE ANIMAL.

10:07.374 --> 10:09.307
MY CLIENT WOULD BE HAPPY
TO BUY THE CHIMPANZEE,

10:09.374 --> 10:10.807
BUT THE DEFENDANT
WON'T SELL HER.

10:10.874 --> 10:11.974
WE'RE NOT PERMITTED
TO SELL OFF

10:12.040 --> 10:13.440
OUR RESEARCH ANIMALS
TO INDIVIDUALS,

10:13.507 --> 10:15.674
AND DR. NESBIT
KNOWS THAT BETTER
THAN ALL OF US.

10:15.740 --> 10:16.740
I AM NOT GONNA STAND UP HERE

10:16.807 --> 10:18.774
AND PRETEND THAT WE'RE NOT
ASKING FOR SPECIAL TREATMENT.

10:18.840 --> 10:21.774
I AM STANDING HERE BECAUSE
I THINK THIS SITUATION
WARRANTS IT.

10:21.840 --> 10:23.140
WHY?

10:23.207 --> 10:24.440
BECAUSE THE CHIMPANZEE

10:24.507 --> 10:27.074
HAS SOCIALLY AND EMOTIONALLY
BONDED WITH DR. NESBIT.

10:27.140 --> 10:30.507
OH, PLEASE. MY DOG
LIKES TO LICK MY FEET.

10:30.574 --> 10:31.940
SHE'S STILL A DOG.

10:32.007 --> 10:33.307
YES, BUT CAN YOUR DOG LAUGH?

10:33.374 --> 10:35.474
CAN YOUR DOG FORM SENTENCES
AND TALK TO YOU?

10:35.540 --> 10:36.740
CAN THE MONKEY?

10:36.807 --> 10:39.007
YES. SHE KNOWS
SIGN LANGUAGE.

10:39.074 --> 10:41.774
NOT JUST WORDS, YOUR HONOR,
BUT WORD COMBINATIONS--

10:41.840 --> 10:43.174
NOUNS AND VERBS--

10:43.240 --> 10:44.874
AND SHE USES LANGUAGE
TO COMMUNICATE.

10:44.940 --> 10:48.840
YOUR HONOR, THERE ARE
HUNDREDS OF CHIMPANZEES
IN PRIMATE CENTERS

10:48.907 --> 10:50.507
THAT HAVE ALL LEARNED
SIGN LANGUAGE.

10:50.574 --> 10:51.940
YES, BUT THIS ONE
COULD BE KILLED
IF SHE'S TRANSFERRED--

10:52.007 --> 10:53.274
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

10:53.340 --> 10:55.840
YOUR HONOR, THIS IS TANTAMOUNT
TO A CHILD CUSTODY CASE,

10:55.907 --> 10:58.574
WHERE WE WOULD ASK YOU
TO RULE IN THE BEST INTEREST
OF THE CHILD.

10:58.640 --> 11:00.140
WITH ONE SMALL EXCEPTION.

11:00.207 --> 11:02.874
THE CHILD HAS RIGHTS.
A CHIMPANZEE DOESN'T.

11:02.940 --> 11:04.007
THAT MAY CHANGE, JUDGE.

11:04.074 --> 11:06.007
AS WE SPEAK, THERE IS
A CASE BEING BROUGHT

11:06.074 --> 11:07.740
TO CONFER EQUALITY
ON GREAT APES.

11:07.807 --> 11:09.274
THAT CASE ISN'T
BEFORE ME, COUNSEL,

11:09.340 --> 11:11.574
AND FRANKLY,
I DON'T CARE ABOUT IT.

11:11.640 --> 11:13.340
ALL APES MAY BE
CREATED EQUAL,

11:13.407 --> 11:15.640
BUT THEY'RE NOT EQUAL
TO HUMANS.

11:15.707 --> 11:18.540
YOUR HONOR, I REALLY
DON'T APPRECIATE
YOUR DISMISSIVENESS--

11:18.607 --> 11:21.240
DOCTOR, DO YOU KNOW
HOW BACKED UP
MY DOCKET IS?

11:21.307 --> 11:24.707
DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG
PEOPLE HAVE TO WAIT

11:24.774 --> 11:26.674
FOR THEIR DAY IN COURT?

11:26.740 --> 11:28.974
SHE'S A MONKEY.

11:32.307 --> 11:33.907
Bobby: YES.
I'M TO BLAME?

11:33.974 --> 11:36.274
ELLENOR GOES OUT
ON AN INTERVIEW,
AND I'M--

11:36.340 --> 11:38.107
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO OPENED UP
PANDORA'S BOX, NOT ME.

11:38.174 --> 11:39.540
OH, HERE YOU GO AGAIN,

11:39.607 --> 11:42.007
REFUSING TO TAKE
RESPONSIBILITY
FOR POOR LEADERSHIP.

11:42.074 --> 11:44.174
I COULD FIRE YOU.
THAT'S LEADERSHIP.

11:44.240 --> 11:46.407
GO AHEAD!
BUT YOU BETTER GET
AN OPINION LETTER FIRST

11:46.474 --> 11:48.474
BECAUSE THE FACT THAT
WE'VE SLEPT TOGETHER,
WITH TODAY'S LAWS--

11:48.540 --> 11:49.707
YOU'RE GONNA CLAIM
SEXUAL HARASSMENT NOW?

11:49.774 --> 11:52.674
THAT WOULD SORT OF BE
MANIPULATING THE LAW,
WOULDN'T IT?

11:52.740 --> 11:55.274
WHAT VACUUM COULD I HAVE
POSSIBLY LEARNED THAT IN?

11:55.340 --> 11:56.340
THIS IS GOOD.

11:56.407 --> 11:57.540
JIMMY...

11:57.607 --> 11:59.107
NO, NO. I MEAN,
REALLY GOOD.

11:59.174 --> 12:02.374
THIS ISN'T
ABOUT OFFICE POLITICS
OR IMPROVING THE FIRM.

12:02.440 --> 12:05.140
THIS IS ABOUT YOU AND ME
SLEEPING TOGETHER.

12:05.207 --> 12:07.907
Lindsay: WE'RE NOT
SLEEPING TOGETHER
ANYMORE.

12:07.974 --> 12:09.740
AND THAT'S WHAT
THIS IS ABOUT.

12:09.807 --> 12:11.174
THAT WE ARE NOT.

12:11.240 --> 12:12.940
YOU CALLED
A MEETING BACK THERE
TO OPEN A DISCUSSION,

12:13.007 --> 12:14.274
WHICH WE DID,
AND IT COMES OUT

12:14.340 --> 12:15.974
THAT ELLENOR
HAS PUT HERSELF
ON THE MARKET,

12:16.040 --> 12:18.140
AND YOU'RE SAYING
THAT'S MY FAULT.

12:18.207 --> 12:21.007
YOU HAVE ISSUES
WITH THESE PEOPLE.

12:21.074 --> 12:22.674
YOU WANT TO LAY THEM
ALL ON ME?

12:22.740 --> 12:24.940
GO AHEAD.
IT'S WHO YOU ARE.

12:27.907 --> 12:29.540
HEY.

12:29.607 --> 12:31.474
HOW'S IT GOIN'?

12:33.907 --> 12:36.340
THAT'S HIM.
NO DOUBT.

12:36.407 --> 12:37.707
YOU KNOW HIM?

12:37.774 --> 12:40.707
MARCUS ROBBINS.
YEAH. HE USED TO BE
A CAPPER OR A RUNNER.

12:40.774 --> 12:41.974
I GUESS
HE'S MOVED UP NOW.

12:42.040 --> 12:43.540
THEY WORK
FOR DOCTORS?

12:43.607 --> 12:45.907
NO, NO. HE AND THE DOCTORS
WORK FOR SOMEBODY BIGGER.

12:45.974 --> 12:48.274
BUT THIS DR. SPIVAK--
HE'S NEW TO US.

12:48.340 --> 12:50.540
HE'S ALREADY GOT ME SET UP
FOR 2 MONTHS OF TREATMENT.

12:50.607 --> 12:53.040
HE HAS TO. HE HAS TO RUN
YOUR MEDICAL BILLS TO 2,000

12:53.107 --> 12:55.140
BEFORE YOU CAN CLAIM
PAIN AND SUFFERING.

12:55.207 --> 12:56.807
THE DOCTOR?
SO CAN YOU ARREST HIM?

12:56.874 --> 13:01.207
FROM WHAT YOU TOLD US,
MAYBE WE CAN GET HIM UP
ON A FRAUD CHARGE, BUT--

13:01.274 --> 13:02.307
BUT WHAT?

13:02.374 --> 13:05.240
HOW FAR ARE YOU WILLING
TO TAKE THIS?

13:10.140 --> 13:11.974
ME?

13:12.040 --> 13:12.807
THE FACT THAT THIS
IS A REAL FIRM...

13:12.874 --> 13:13.974
BUT WHY JIMMY?

13:14.040 --> 13:15.774
WELL,
NOTHING PERSONAL.

13:15.840 --> 13:18.240
GO AHEAD.

13:18.307 --> 13:20.107
THOSE JIMMY THE GRUNT
COMMERCIALS--

13:20.174 --> 13:23.274
YOU SEEM LIKE
THE PERFECT LAWYER TO...

13:23.340 --> 13:25.840
I THINK THEY MIGHT BELIEVE
YOU COULD BE ONE OF THEM.

13:25.907 --> 13:28.607
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.
IT'S ONE THING TO MEET
WITH THE DOCTOR, BUT--

13:28.674 --> 13:31.140
PLUS, I DON'T EVEN THINK
WE CAN DO WHAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT.

13:31.207 --> 13:33.340
ATTORNEY/CLIENT PRIVILEGE.
WE CAN'T STING A CLIENT.

13:33.407 --> 13:34.840
I WANT TO DO IT.

13:34.907 --> 13:37.840
EXACTLY WHAT ARE WE
TALKING ABOUT HERE?

13:37.907 --> 13:39.340
WELL, FOR JIMMY TO BE
ASSIGNED SOME CASES,

13:39.407 --> 13:41.740
THE LEADER OF THE RING
WOULD WANT TO MEET
WITH HIM,

13:41.807 --> 13:42.707
CHECK HIM OUT.

13:42.774 --> 13:44.274
IT SOUNDS TOO RISKY.

13:44.340 --> 13:45.440
IT'S UP TO YOU.

13:45.507 --> 13:47.640
I DON'T THINK
THERE'S ANY RISK
OF PHYSICAL DANGER,

13:47.707 --> 13:49.974
BUT IT'S TOTALLY
UP TO YOU.

13:51.574 --> 13:52.740
I'M IN.

13:52.807 --> 13:54.940
SO AM I.

13:55.007 --> 13:58.374
BAD...BAD IDEA.

14:00.774 --> 14:02.707
I WAS BASICALLY
THE PRIMATOLOGIST

14:02.774 --> 14:03.940
IN CHARGE
OF TRAINING HER.

14:04.007 --> 14:05.107
TRAINING HER IN...

14:05.174 --> 14:07.274
LANGUAGE.
COMMUNICATION.

14:07.340 --> 14:09.374
SO TINA ACTUALLY KNOWS
SIGN LANGUAGE.

14:09.440 --> 14:10.274
YES.

14:10.340 --> 14:13.007
YOU MEAN
SHE OBEYS COMMANDS,

14:13.074 --> 14:15.974
OR SHE ACTUALLY UNDERSTANDS
WHAT WORDS MEAN?

14:16.040 --> 14:17.774
I MEAN SHE CONVEYS
INFORMATION, YOUR HONOR.

14:17.840 --> 14:21.274
SHE CAN ACTUALLY TELL ME
ABOUT HER PHYSICAL
AND MENTAL WELL-BEING.

14:21.340 --> 14:23.940
SHE CAN USE
ABSTRACT SYMBOLS,

14:24.007 --> 14:26.774
AND SHE CAN TEACH LANGUAGE
TO OTHER APES.

14:26.840 --> 14:28.607
YOU MAKE HER SOUND
ALMOST HUMAN.

14:28.674 --> 14:29.940
SHE IS ALMOST HUMAN.

14:30.007 --> 14:33.074
IN FACT, 98%
OF A CHIMPANZEE'S DNA
IS THE SAME,

14:33.140 --> 14:36.074
EXACTLY THE SAME
AS A HUMAN'S.

14:39.640 --> 14:42.374
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S BE CLEAR.

14:42.440 --> 14:47.174
YOU BELIEVE IN ANIMAL TESTING
FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH?

14:47.240 --> 14:49.274
YES, BUT THE LINE
BETWEEN--

14:49.340 --> 14:51.174
WE'LL GET TO THE LINE
IN A SECOND.

14:51.240 --> 14:54.940
BUT YOU'RE OK
WITH USING ANIMALS,
SACRIFICING ANIMALS,

14:55.007 --> 14:57.707
FOR AIDS RESEARCH,
CANCER RESEARCH?

14:57.774 --> 14:58.874
BUT NOT APES.

14:58.940 --> 15:00.940
BUT NOT APES?

15:01.007 --> 15:03.940
NO CRUELTY TO APES?

15:04.974 --> 15:08.340
THE PRIMATE RESEARCH
THAT YOU DO, DOCTOR--

15:08.407 --> 15:10.640
DOES IT EVER INVOLVE
CRUELTY TO THE APES?

15:10.707 --> 15:12.240
I TRY NOT TO BE
CRUEL TO--

15:12.307 --> 15:15.374
YEAH, YEAH. LET'S CHECK
THE HYPOCRISY AT THE DOOR.

15:15.440 --> 15:18.407
IF WE'RE TALKING
THE BEST INTEREST
OF THE APE,

15:18.474 --> 15:22.140
IT WOULD BE TO LEAVE IT
IN THE WILD, RIGHT?

15:22.207 --> 15:23.007
YES.

15:23.074 --> 15:25.074
I MEAN, BEING CAGED
IN A PRIMATE CENTER

15:25.140 --> 15:27.374
ISN'T SUCH A GOOD THING
FOR THE CHIMPANZEES.

15:27.440 --> 15:29.840
I'M UP HERE
TALKING ABOUT ONE
CHIMPANZEE. PERIOD.

15:29.907 --> 15:32.974
AND THAT IS NO DOUBT
THE TRUTH, ISN'T IT?
YOU LOVE THIS APE.

15:33.040 --> 15:34.040
I'M NOT DENYING THAT.

15:34.107 --> 15:35.507
LOVE HER LIKE
YOUR OWN CHILD.

15:35.574 --> 15:37.007
ISN'T THAT WHAT THIS
IS ALL ABOUT, DOCTOR?

15:37.074 --> 15:38.707
IT'S NOT JUST ME
LOVING HER.

15:38.774 --> 15:40.507
SHE LOVES ME.

15:40.574 --> 15:42.107
THIS IS A SPECIES

15:42.174 --> 15:44.207
CAPABLE OF LOVING,
MR. MYRON.

15:44.274 --> 15:47.007
CAPABLE OF SADNESS,
DEPRESSION.

15:47.074 --> 15:48.540
DO YOU GET THAT?

15:48.607 --> 15:50.974
ARE APES...

15:51.040 --> 15:53.640
THE ONLY SPECIES...

15:53.707 --> 15:55.807
CAPABLE OF
EMOTIONAL BONDING?

15:55.874 --> 15:56.874
NO.

15:56.940 --> 15:59.340
DOLPHINS? ELEPHANTS?

15:59.407 --> 16:01.940
NOT NEARLY
TO THE CAPACITY
OF THE CHIMPANZEE.

16:02.007 --> 16:04.974
YES, BUT A DOLPHIN
DOES EMOTIONALLY BOND.

16:05.040 --> 16:07.307
AND AN ELEPHANT
CAN GET DEPRESSED.

16:07.374 --> 16:10.374
I EVEN READ A STORY ONCE
ABOUT A HAWK

16:10.440 --> 16:12.507
THAT WAS SEPARATED
FROM HER OWNER,

16:12.574 --> 16:14.540
AND SHE SUFFERED
FROM SEVERE WEIGHT LOSS

16:14.607 --> 16:17.507
AND DIED
DUE TO DEPRESSION.
WOULD THAT BE POSSIBLE?

16:17.574 --> 16:18.640
MIGHT BE.

16:18.707 --> 16:20.040
SO WHAT ARE
WE SUPPOSED TO DO?

16:20.107 --> 16:22.707
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO COME UP WITH
SOME KIND OF BONDING TEST?

16:22.774 --> 16:25.174
IF THE ANIMAL PASSES,
DIFFERENT RULES?

16:25.240 --> 16:26.674
DON'T MOCK ME,
MR. MYRON.

16:26.740 --> 16:28.774
I AM NOT MOCKING YOU,
DOCTOR.

16:28.840 --> 16:32.407
I AM JUST WONDERING
ABOUT THE NEXT SCIENTIST
SITTING IN THAT CHAIR

16:32.474 --> 16:37.474
WHO SAYS, "MY PIG LOVES ME.
YOU CAN'T KILL HER."

16:40.274 --> 16:43.107
IF I FIRE HER,
WHAT'S THE PULSE
GONNA BE AROUND HERE?

16:43.174 --> 16:44.307
BAD.

16:44.374 --> 16:46.740
LOOK WHAT SHE'S DONE,
WHAT SHE'S STIRRED UP.

16:46.807 --> 16:48.340
THIS OFFICE HAS NEVER
BEEN ABOUT GREED.

16:48.407 --> 16:51.707
LINDSAY'S NOT ABOUT
GREED, EITHER.
WE BOTH KNOW THAT.

16:51.774 --> 16:53.607
YOU THINK I'M GUILTY
OF BAD LEADERSHIP?

16:53.674 --> 16:55.940
YOU TALK TO ELLENOR YET?
GOIN' OUT ON INTERVIEWS.

16:56.007 --> 16:57.240
YOU ASK HER ABOUT THAT?

16:57.307 --> 16:58.374
I WILL.

16:58.440 --> 17:00.040
YOU WILL.

17:00.107 --> 17:02.107
BOBBY, LINDSAY'S RIGHT.

17:02.174 --> 17:03.640
WE DON'T HAVE A PLAN.

17:03.707 --> 17:05.240
WHY DO WE EVEN
REALLY NEED ONE?

17:05.307 --> 17:08.007
WE MAKE A LIVING.
WE'RE ALL OUR OWN BOSSES
FOR THE MOST PART.

17:08.074 --> 17:09.207
THERE'S SOMETHING
TO BE SAID FOR THAT.

17:09.273 --> 17:11.607
THERE'S SOMETHING TO BE SAID
FOR OWNING A HOUSE, TOO.

17:11.674 --> 17:14.074
I GOT A SON. I GOT HIS
EDUCATION TO THINK ABOUT.

17:14.140 --> 17:15.307
COLLEGE TAKES MONEY.

17:15.374 --> 17:17.273
NOW, IF THOSE DAYS
ARE AHEAD FOR HIM,

17:17.339 --> 17:19.674
IF THOSE DAYS
ARE AHEAD FOR US,

17:19.740 --> 17:21.074
THEN LINDSAY
MAY BE RIGHT.

17:21.140 --> 17:22.740
WE GOTTA HAVE
A BETTER PLAN.

17:22.807 --> 17:25.207
SHE HAS POISONED
THIS PLACE!

17:26.940 --> 17:28.473
EUGENE...

17:29.607 --> 17:31.807
I THINK WE SHOULD
BROOM HER.

17:31.874 --> 17:36.507
WE START FRESH, AND THEN
WE BUILD A PARTNERSHIP,
IF THAT'S THE ANSWER.

17:36.574 --> 17:39.407
LOOK, MAN,
EVERYBODY HERE
LOVES LINDSAY.

17:39.474 --> 17:41.807
NOW, NEXT TO REBECCA,
SHE'S THE CLOSEST THING

17:41.874 --> 17:44.074
THIS PLACE HAS
TO A CONSCIENCE.

17:45.774 --> 17:48.607
AND YOU LOVE HER, TOO.

17:49.607 --> 17:52.507
MAYBE MORE THAN
YOU KNOW.

18:09.906 --> 18:12.073
[DOOR CLOSES]

18:16.173 --> 18:19.973
IT'S THE STUPID MONKEY CASE.
I'M OFF TO COURT.

18:21.106 --> 18:23.373
YOU GONNA LEAVE,
ELLENOR?

18:23.439 --> 18:26.239
I WAS JUST SEEIN'
WHAT'S OUT THERE, BOBBY.

18:26.306 --> 18:29.739
PEOPLE DON'T GO INTERVIEWING
IF THEY DON'T PLAN TO LEAVE.

18:29.806 --> 18:31.239
IF YOU'VE ANSWERED
YOUR OWN QUESTION,

18:31.306 --> 18:32.639
WHY EVEN BOTHER
TO ASK IT?

18:32.706 --> 18:34.973
THERE'S YOUR ANSWER,
AND THERE'S MY ANSWER.

18:35.039 --> 18:37.939
I JUST THINK I NEED
TO TAKE A GOOD LOOK
AT WHAT'S OUT THERE

18:38.006 --> 18:40.173
AND MAYBE
TAKE A BETTER LOOK
AT WHAT'S IN HERE.

18:40.239 --> 18:41.739
WHAT THE HELL
DOES THAT MEAN?

18:41.806 --> 18:43.573
IT MEANS IF YOU'VE BEEN
SLEEPING WITH HER

18:43.639 --> 18:46.373
AND THERE'S BEEN A SHIFT
IN THE BALANCE OF POWER
THAT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT,

18:46.439 --> 18:48.439
I DON'T LIKE IT.

19:19.406 --> 19:21.873
H-HELEN SAID
DON'T ACT ANXIOUS.

19:21.939 --> 19:23.139
I WON'T.

19:23.206 --> 19:24.839
WHERE'S THE MEETING?

19:24.906 --> 19:27.573
ACROSS THE STREET.
COFFEE SHOP.

19:31.806 --> 19:34.006
OH, I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY. I'M SO--

19:34.073 --> 19:36.406
ELLENOR?
FRED SPIVAK.

19:36.473 --> 19:38.573
OH, MY GOD! FRED!

19:38.639 --> 19:40.673
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.
HOW ARE YOU?

19:40.739 --> 19:43.839
I'M GREAT. GOD,
IT'S GREAT TO SEE YOU.
WHAT A SURPRISE.

19:43.906 --> 19:45.406
LAST I HEARD, YOU WERE
IN MEDICAL SCHOOL.

19:45.473 --> 19:48.239
CHIROPRACTOR. AND YOU--
I SAW YOU ON TV ONCE.
YOU'RE A LAWYER.

19:48.306 --> 19:49.673
GUILTY.

19:49.739 --> 19:52.006
YOU WERE DEFENDING
SOME PORN QUEEN
CHARGED WITH MURDER.

19:52.073 --> 19:54.073
YEP, GUILTY AGAIN,
BUT SHE WAS INNOCENT.

19:54.139 --> 19:56.239
HA HA HA.
YOU LOOK GREAT.

19:56.306 --> 19:57.406
THANK YOU.
YOU DO, TOO.

19:57.473 --> 19:59.306
YOU KNOW,
I GOTTA GO.

19:59.373 --> 20:01.373
I'M LATE FOR COURT,
BUT CAN I CALL YOU?

20:01.439 --> 20:04.339
YES. ABSOLUTELY. HERE.
LET ME GIVE YOU MY CARD.

20:04.406 --> 20:06.406
IT'S GREAT TO SEE YA,
FRED.
YEAH.

20:06.473 --> 20:09.139
I WILL CALL YOU.
TODAY.

20:09.206 --> 20:10.106
TERRIFIC.

20:11.939 --> 20:14.173
I DON'T KNOW.
SO WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN?

20:14.239 --> 20:15.406
WE'LL HAVE ANOTHER
BIG MEETING.

20:15.473 --> 20:16.873
IT'LL PROBABLY
TURN INTO A SHOUT FEST.

20:16.939 --> 20:18.773
BOBBY WILL RUN OFF
AND BUY A NEW SUIT,

20:18.839 --> 20:21.106
AND EVERYTHING
WILL STAY THE SAME.

20:21.173 --> 20:23.506
THEN LEAVE. COME HERE.
IT'S FUN.

20:23.573 --> 20:26.406
WE MIGHT EVEN GET TO BRING
THE DEATH PENALTY BACK.

20:26.473 --> 20:27.973
YOU'RE NOT SMILING.

20:28.039 --> 20:29.573
HELEN...

20:31.573 --> 20:34.739
YOU THINK YOU AND BOBBY
WILL GET BACK TOGETHER?

20:34.806 --> 20:36.606
OH, BOY.

20:36.673 --> 20:38.773
NOTHING'S GONNA HAPPEN
BETWEEN US,

20:38.839 --> 20:42.306
BUT...OH, I THINK
I'M LOVE WITH HIM.

20:42.373 --> 20:44.873
DON'T ASK ME
TO SAY IT TWICE.

20:46.406 --> 20:48.339
BOBBY AND I ARE OVER.

20:48.406 --> 20:50.339
DON'T GET ALL
DIPLOMATIC WITH ME.

20:50.406 --> 20:51.839
YOU'RE THE ONE
HE WANTS, NOT ME,

20:51.906 --> 20:53.339
WHICH IS FINE.
I'M OK WITH IT.

20:53.406 --> 20:56.573
BUT WHAT I'M NOT OK WITH
IS STAYING THERE
IF YOU WANT HIM.

20:56.639 --> 20:58.339
BECAUSE THEN
IT'LL BE MESSY.

20:58.406 --> 21:01.106
IF THE TWO OF YOU
HAVE A FUTURE,

21:01.173 --> 21:04.973
JUST DON'T FEED ME
THAT UNSELFISH,
DIPLOMATIC CRAP, OK?

21:05.039 --> 21:06.939
WHO'S FEEDING WHO CRAP?

21:07.006 --> 21:09.373
IF BOBBY AND I HAVE A FUTURE,
YOU'LL QUIT THE FIRM?

21:09.439 --> 21:11.739
WHAT ARE YOU,
A CROSS BETWEEN CUPID

21:11.806 --> 21:14.239
AND GLENDA THE GOOD WITCH
OF THE NORTH?

21:14.306 --> 21:15.673
OH, SHUT UP.

21:15.739 --> 21:16.939
DON'T TELL ME
TO SHUT UP.

21:17.006 --> 21:20.273
IF YOU LOVE THE GUY,
BE A WOMAN ABOUT IT.
CLAW MY EYES OUT.

21:20.339 --> 21:21.873
I'D DO IT TO YOU.

21:23.839 --> 21:26.173
OK, HE'S NOT EVEN
INTO ME, HELEN.

21:26.239 --> 21:28.373
NOTHING'S GONNA HAPPEN,
ANYWAY.

21:28.439 --> 21:30.873
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING

21:30.939 --> 21:36.106
IS IF THERE'S ANYTHING
BETWEEN BOBBY AND ME,
YOU'LL LEAVE.

21:36.173 --> 21:40.073
AND IF THERE ISN'T,
YOU'LL STAY AND LET THINGS
FALL WHERE THEY WOULD FALL?

21:41.339 --> 21:42.939
BASICALLY.

21:43.006 --> 21:45.073
BOBBY AND I ARE OVER.

21:51.539 --> 21:53.539
YOU LOVE HIM.

21:57.406 --> 21:58.773
WHAT'S MY CUT?

21:58.839 --> 21:59.839
20%.

21:59.906 --> 22:02.973
20? MY CONTINGENCY'S 33.
WHY THE HELL WOULD I--

22:03.039 --> 22:05.006
WE'RE NOT ASKING YOU
TO BUILD A CASE.
WE'RE GIVING IT TO YOU.

22:05.073 --> 22:06.639
LIABILITY AND DAMAGES.

22:06.706 --> 22:08.239
EVEN SO.

22:08.306 --> 22:10.506
REBECCA SAID
THIS IS UP YOUR ALLEY.

22:10.573 --> 22:13.139
OH, MY ALLEY'S
REAL ESTATE LOANS.

22:13.206 --> 22:14.373
BANKING.

22:14.439 --> 22:16.973
THIS IS A LOT EASIER
THAN THAT.

22:18.039 --> 22:18.873
OK.

22:18.939 --> 22:21.973
BUT I DON'T WANNA
KNOW NOTHIN'.

22:26.439 --> 22:28.639
YOU TELL YOUR PATIENTS
TO JUST GIMME THE BILLS

22:28.706 --> 22:30.406
AND THE VERSION
OF HOW IT HAPPENED.

22:30.473 --> 22:31.473
THEY'RE GONNA KNOW
YOU'D KNOW.

22:31.539 --> 22:32.539
THAT'S WHY
I'D BE SENDING THEM.

22:32.606 --> 22:34.606
I JUST DON'T WANT IT
SAID PLAIN.

22:34.673 --> 22:37.406
THEY WANNA WINK, FINE,

22:37.473 --> 22:39.806
BUT MY ASS STAYS COVERED.

22:39.873 --> 22:42.206
OK. GOT IT.

22:42.273 --> 22:45.473
SO, UH, HOW DO WE
GO FROM HERE?

22:45.539 --> 22:47.773
A MAN NAMED ROLAND MAPP
WILL COME AND SEE YOU.

22:47.839 --> 22:48.739
HE'S THE GUY?

22:48.806 --> 22:50.973
RIGHT. HE'LL WANNA CHECK OUT
YOUR PLACE OF WORK.

22:51.039 --> 22:53.073
LISTEN, IF YOU THINK YOU CAN
CUT A BETTER DEAL...

22:53.139 --> 22:54.106
GO AHEAD.

22:57.639 --> 23:00.106
WE CAN CONTINUE WITH
THIS CASE IF WE WANT,

23:00.173 --> 23:02.006
BUT I JUST HAVE TO ASK.

23:02.073 --> 23:04.539
THIS CAN'T BE BRINGING
ANYBODY GOOD PUBLICITY.

23:04.606 --> 23:07.439
IF SHE'S WILLING TO BUY
THE MONKEY...

23:07.506 --> 23:08.439
CHIMPANZEE.

23:08.506 --> 23:10.073
WHATEVER.

23:10.139 --> 23:13.506
YOUR HONOR,
THESE CHIMPANZEES
COST ABOUT $20,000.

23:13.573 --> 23:16.339
COULD YOU REALLY
AFFORD TO BUY HER?

23:16.406 --> 23:18.706
NO, BUT MAYBE I
COULD RAISE THE MONEY.

23:18.773 --> 23:21.206
SECOND, IF WE OPEN
THE DOOR TO THE IDEA

23:21.273 --> 23:23.173
THAT THEY COULD BE
BOUGHT, WATCH OUT.

23:23.239 --> 23:24.439
WHY?

23:24.506 --> 23:26.039
BECAUSE ANIMAL
GROUPS ALL OVER

23:26.106 --> 23:27.506
WILL BE STARTING
TRUST FUNDS.

23:27.573 --> 23:30.473
RESEARCH CANNOT BE
CONTAMINATED
BY POLITICS OR--

23:30.539 --> 23:32.506
BOTTOM LINE IS THIS
IS A RESEARCH ANIMAL,

23:32.573 --> 23:34.339
AND THEY'RE ASKING YOU
TO TREAT IT OTHERWISE.

23:34.406 --> 23:36.006
AND IF YOU DO, WHAT
ABOUT THE NEXT CHIMP?

23:36.073 --> 23:37.339
AND THE ONE AFTER THAT?

23:37.406 --> 23:38.806
I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET HER.

23:38.873 --> 23:40.206
WHO?

23:40.273 --> 23:42.539
TINA. I'D LIKE YOU TO
MEET THE RESEARCH ANIMAL
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

23:42.606 --> 23:44.073
SHE COULD BE
BROUGHT HERE, RIGHT?

23:44.139 --> 23:45.206
ABSOLUTELY.

23:45.273 --> 23:46.573
I'M AFRAID OF MONKEYS.

23:46.639 --> 23:48.039
WE ALL KNOW HER FATE

23:48.106 --> 23:50.006
IF SHE GOES OFF
INTO THE WORLD OF
BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH.

23:50.073 --> 23:54.539
IS IT TOO INHUMAN OF US
TO SPEND 15 MINUTES
WITH HER FIRST?

23:57.439 --> 23:58.973
2:00.

23:59.039 --> 24:00.273
AW, COME ON.
YOUR HONOR?

24:00.339 --> 24:02.373
2:00! I'LL MEET
WITH THE APE.

24:03.839 --> 24:06.173
IN CHAMBERS. YOU'RE BRINGING
THE BABOON TO CHAMBERS?

24:06.239 --> 24:07.639
CHIMPANZEE.

24:07.706 --> 24:09.173
DO WE GET ANY MONEY
ON THIS?

24:09.239 --> 24:11.306
EUGENE, NOT EVERYTHING
IS ABOUT MONEY.
JUST ASK LINDSAY.

24:11.373 --> 24:13.106
YOU CAN BITE ME TWICE.

24:16.806 --> 24:18.406
OK.

24:18.473 --> 24:20.839
FIRST, THIS IS MY FIRM.
I STARTED IT.

24:20.906 --> 24:23.373
IT WILL ALWAYS BE MORE MINE
THAN ANYBODY'S ELSE'S.

24:23.439 --> 24:26.573
SECOND, I'M NOT ABOUT TO
CHANGE THE WAY WE OPERATE.
THIS IS WHAT IT IS.

24:26.639 --> 24:28.906
NO MANAGEMENT COMMITTEES,
NO ADMINISTRATIVE PARTNERS,

24:28.973 --> 24:31.439
WE SEE A CASE WE WANT,
WE TAKE IT.

24:32.339 --> 24:33.573
THE THIRD?

24:34.573 --> 24:36.439
THERE'S GOTTA BE
A THIRD.

24:36.506 --> 24:39.639
THIRD...
I NEED YOUR COMMITMENT.

24:39.706 --> 24:42.873
TO GET IT, I'M WILLING
TO COMMIT BACK.

24:42.939 --> 24:44.973
I'LL WAIVE BUY-IN.
STARTING TODAY,

24:45.039 --> 24:46.973
BASED ON SENIORITY,
EUGENE, YOU GET 12%;

24:47.039 --> 24:49.506
ELLENOR, 10;
LINDSAY, 8;
REBECCA, 5.

24:49.573 --> 24:52.506
JIMMY, IN ANOTHER YEAR,
YOU START AT 8.

24:52.573 --> 24:54.906
VOTING RIGHTS: I GET 2,
THE REST OF YOU GET ONE,

24:54.973 --> 24:56.506
THAT'S AS FAIR AS I GET.

24:56.573 --> 24:59.039
LINDSAY, SINCE YOU'VE
BEEN SUCH A CATALYST,

24:59.106 --> 25:02.106
I'LL PUT YOU IN CHARGE
OF DRAFTING THE PAPERS.

25:02.173 --> 25:03.173
ANY QUESTIONS?

25:03.239 --> 25:04.873
GOOD.

25:04.939 --> 25:07.106
I GOT A QUESTION.

25:08.539 --> 25:11.539
WHY DO I GOT
TO WAIT A YEAR?

25:11.606 --> 25:14.506
JIMMY, YOU'VE ONLY BEEN HERE
A YEAR AND A HALF.

25:14.573 --> 25:17.439
YOU'LL GET EQUITY AFTER
BEING HERE ONLY 2 1/2 YEARS.

25:17.506 --> 25:19.473
WHERE ELSE COULD YOU
DO THAT?

25:22.539 --> 25:24.973
ANYBODY ELSE
HAVE A COMPLAINT?

25:39.339 --> 25:41.439
SHE WON'T HURT YOU.

25:43.273 --> 25:45.473
I THINK SHE'S
JUST BEING SHY.

25:45.539 --> 25:46.839
SHE GETS SHY.

25:46.906 --> 25:49.273
WHICH, I MIGHT ADD, IS
SOMETHING ELSE TO CONSIDER.

25:49.339 --> 25:50.873
SHE'S CAPABLE OF SHYNESS.

25:50.939 --> 25:52.339
OH, BOY. CAN YOU SPIN.

25:52.406 --> 25:54.206
MAYBE SHE'S JUST
PLEADING THE FIFTH.

25:54.273 --> 25:56.106
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE DON'T NEED THAT.

25:56.173 --> 25:57.839
HOW OLD IS SHE?

25:57.906 --> 25:58.706
SHE'S 5.

25:58.773 --> 26:01.473
AND HER INTELLIGENCE
WOULD BE...

26:01.539 --> 26:03.373
THE SAME
AS A 3-YEAR-OLD.

26:03.439 --> 26:04.739
HUMAN?
HUMAN, YES.

26:04.806 --> 26:05.673
TINA.

26:05.739 --> 26:07.706
TELL THE JUDGE "HELLO."

26:07.773 --> 26:09.839
TELL HER YOUR NAME.
GO AHEAD.

26:09.906 --> 26:12.106
HERE. TRY THIS.

26:12.173 --> 26:13.839
OH.

26:22.806 --> 26:27.373
UH, WOULD YOU LIKE
A BANANA, TINA?

26:28.739 --> 26:30.439
SHE JUST FLIPPED ME OFF!

26:30.506 --> 26:31.539
NO. NO, SHE DIDN'T.

26:31.606 --> 26:33.973
DOCTOR, I KNOW WHEN
I'M BEING FLIPPED OFF.

26:34.039 --> 26:35.439
BAD MONKEY.

26:35.506 --> 26:38.039
[TINA SHRIEKS]

26:38.106 --> 26:39.639
Hiller: HEY! THAT'LL DO.

26:42.806 --> 26:43.973
TINA! NO!

26:46.073 --> 26:49.439
VERY, VERY BAD MONKEY.

26:50.539 --> 26:52.539
SHE'S A LITTLE BITCH.

26:54.306 --> 26:58.106
NO. IT IS NOT FUNNY.
WE ARE TRYING
TO SAVE HER LIFE.

26:58.173 --> 27:01.339
WELL, YOU DO GET
SOME INTERESTING CASES,
ELLENOR.

27:01.406 --> 27:03.539
I WISH I DID.

27:03.606 --> 27:06.006
IT'S NOT FUN BEING
A CHIROPRACTOR?

27:06.073 --> 27:08.506
OH, I CAN'T SAY EVERYTHING
TURNED OUT, YOU KNOW,

27:08.573 --> 27:10.639
THE WAY I THOUGHT OR HOPED.

27:10.706 --> 27:12.973
WELL, YOU'RE NOT TOO OLD
TO SWITCH CAREERS.

27:13.039 --> 27:14.239
THANKS.

27:14.306 --> 27:15.539
I KNOW THAT WAS MEANT
TO FLATTER ME,

27:15.606 --> 27:17.073
BUT I GOT ALIMONY
AND CHILD SUPPORT...

27:17.139 --> 27:18.606
HOW MANY KIDS
DO YOU HAVE?

27:18.673 --> 27:19.506
2...

27:19.573 --> 27:21.873
GREAT ONES.
LIVE WITH THEIR MOM.

27:21.939 --> 27:22.773
DO YOU GET TO SEE 'EM?

27:22.839 --> 27:24.773
YEAH. I COACH LITTLE LEAGUE,
AND MY OLDEST KEVIN

27:24.839 --> 27:27.039
PLAYS FOR ME,
SO IN THE SPRING,
I SEE HIM EVERY DAY.

27:27.106 --> 27:27.906
THAT'S GREAT.

27:27.973 --> 27:29.239
YOU? NONE FOR YOU?

27:29.306 --> 27:32.673
MM, NO. WAITING FOR
THAT PERFECT GUY
TO COME ALONG, YOU KNOW.

27:32.739 --> 27:34.639
YEAH. ELLIE, YOU KNOW
THOSE STORIES YOU HEAR

27:34.706 --> 27:36.606
ABOUT HOW CHILDREN
CHANGE YOUR LIFE?

27:36.673 --> 27:37.406
YEAH.

27:37.473 --> 27:38.473
ALL TRUE.

27:38.539 --> 27:41.139
SOUNDS LIKE
YOU LOVE 'EM.

27:48.573 --> 27:50.273
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

27:50.339 --> 27:52.039
I'M GOING, SO YOU'LL
HAVE TO LOCK UP.

27:52.106 --> 27:53.573
OK.

27:55.573 --> 27:57.973
I'M JUST A SECRETARY,
YOU KNOW.

27:58.039 --> 27:59.239
EXCUSE ME?

27:59.306 --> 28:02.573
WHY ARE YOU
MAKING ME A PARTNER?

28:03.839 --> 28:06.973
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT
JUST A SECRETARY.

28:08.473 --> 28:10.373
I DON'T EVEN THINK
IT'S LEGAL TECHNICALLY

28:10.439 --> 28:12.006
TO MAKE A NON-LAWYER
A PARTNER.

28:13.206 --> 28:14.439
SUE ME.

28:15.439 --> 28:17.773
BOBBY, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DO THIS.

28:17.839 --> 28:20.706
SPLITTING UP THE PIE, THAT
WAS THE DIFFICULT DECISION.

28:20.773 --> 28:23.606
GIVING SOME OF IT TO YOU,
THAT WAS EASY.

28:27.073 --> 28:28.606
THANK YOU.

28:30.206 --> 28:31.806
YEAH.

28:31.873 --> 28:36.139
H-HOW'S THAT, UM,
THAT STING THING GOING?

28:36.206 --> 28:38.006
PRETTY GOOD.

28:47.073 --> 28:48.073
THANK YOU.

DO YOU REALLY
HAVE TO TELL HER?

29:08.422 --> 29:10.889
ELLENOR, IF WE LOSE,
SHE GOES TONIGHT.

29:10.956 --> 29:12.956
I HAVE TO PREPARE HER.

29:13.022 --> 29:16.022
I THOUGHT SHE SORT
OF ALREADY KNOWS.

29:16.089 --> 29:18.756
SHE DOESN'T KNOW TONIGHT.

29:18.822 --> 29:20.489
KATHERINE.

29:20.556 --> 29:22.656
CARDS ON THE TABLE.

29:22.722 --> 29:24.356
EXCUSE ME?

29:24.422 --> 29:26.456
OBVIOUSLY,
YOU DO LOVE HER.

29:26.522 --> 29:29.156
IS THIS MORE ABOUT THAT,
OR ARE THESE ANIMALS
REALLY CAP--

29:29.222 --> 29:30.989
THEY'RE DIFFERENT,
ELLENOR.

29:31.056 --> 29:32.922
I'M NOT DENYING LOVING HER.

29:32.989 --> 29:38.122
BUT WE USED TO SAY WHAT
SEPARATED HUMANS FROM ALL
OTHER SPECIES WAS LANGUAGE.

29:38.189 --> 29:39.856
THAT ISN'T TRUE ANYMORE.

29:39.922 --> 29:44.589
BRAIN SCANS SHOW THEY HAVE
THE SAME BRAIN ARCHITECTURE
AS WE DO FOR LANGUAGE

29:44.656 --> 29:45.556
AND YET...

29:48.789 --> 29:51.089
I BETTER TELL HER.

29:51.156 --> 29:52.656
DO YOU WANT ME
TO LEAVE YOU ALONE?

29:52.722 --> 29:54.522
ACTUALLY, NO.

29:54.589 --> 29:57.022
SHE'S A LITTLE BIT MORE STOIC
IN FRONT OF STRANGERS.

29:57.089 --> 29:58.489
IT'LL MAKE IT EASIER FOR ME.

29:58.556 --> 30:01.156
I DON'T WANT HER TO SEE ME
GETTING...

30:08.622 --> 30:09.722
TINA...

30:09.789 --> 30:12.622
WE TALKED BEFORE.

30:12.689 --> 30:18.022
YOU MAYBE HAVE TO GO
LIVE WITH SOMEBODY ELSE.

30:20.122 --> 30:25.189
YES. YOU MAYBE
HAVE TO GO SOON.

30:27.822 --> 30:29.122
TONIGHT.

30:34.489 --> 30:36.822
NO, THAT'S NOT WHY.

30:36.889 --> 30:39.689
I DO LOVE YOU.

30:58.922 --> 31:00.222
JIMMY? JIMMY.

31:00.289 --> 31:01.722
ROLAND MAPP,
HE JUST CALLED.

31:01.789 --> 31:02.822
OK.

31:02.889 --> 31:04.822
11:00, THE GUY'S
COMING NOW.

31:04.889 --> 31:06.356
ARE WE READY?
IS THE ROOM READY?

31:06.422 --> 31:07.156
IT'S ALL SET.

31:07.222 --> 31:08.456
OK. DON'T PUSH IT.

31:08.522 --> 31:09.522
I WON'T.

31:09.589 --> 31:10.822
IF YOU'RE TOO ANXIOUS--

31:10.889 --> 31:12.356
I AIN'T GONNA BE
TOO ANXIOUS.

31:12.422 --> 31:13.356
WHAT'S GOING ON?

31:13.422 --> 31:14.922
BIG STING. 11:00.
THE GUY'S COMING.

31:14.989 --> 31:16.522
OH, I SHOULD CALL
HELEN.

31:16.589 --> 31:18.822
YOU NEED
ANY BACKUP?

31:18.889 --> 31:21.722
NO. I, UH,
BETTER GO IT ALONE.

31:21.789 --> 31:23.322
GOOD LUCK.

31:23.389 --> 31:24.322
THANKS.

31:33.589 --> 31:36.556
I CAN DO IT ALONE.
I DON'T NEED BACKUP.

31:38.022 --> 31:38.956
FINE.

31:39.022 --> 31:40.189
FINE?

31:40.256 --> 31:41.856
I APPRECIATE
THE CONFIDENCE.

31:41.922 --> 31:43.589
WHAT'S THAT ABOUT?

31:43.656 --> 31:45.889
YOU MAKE
THE OTHERS PARTNERS.
ME, I GOTTA WAIT.

31:45.956 --> 31:48.922
YOU DON'T TRUST ME
WITH CASES. I GOTTA
DIG 'EM UP MYSELF.

31:48.989 --> 31:50.856
I'M A LITTLE SICK
OF IT ALL.

31:50.922 --> 31:53.222
HOLD IT.
CLOSE THE DOOR, JIMMY.

31:54.656 --> 31:56.956
THERE ISN'T A SINGLE
LAW FIRM IN THIS CITY

31:57.022 --> 31:58.956
THAT WILL GIVE YOU EQUITY
INSIDE 3 YEARS.

31:59.022 --> 32:00.956
YOU COULD BE
ON THE STREET THAT LONG

32:01.022 --> 32:03.189
TRYING TO FIND ONE
THAT WOULD EVEN HIRE YOU.

32:03.256 --> 32:06.522
ELLENOR, EUGENE, AND LINDSAY
HAVE HELPED BUILD THIS PLACE.

32:06.589 --> 32:09.056
GIVING THEM PARTNERSHIP
WOULD BE MEANINGLESS

32:09.122 --> 32:11.122
IF I ALSO GAVE IT TO YOU.

32:11.189 --> 32:14.289
I'M SORRY TO SAY IT,
BUT YOU NEED TO HEAR IT.

32:14.356 --> 32:17.856
I'M GONNA SEE THIS
STING THING THROUGH.

32:17.922 --> 32:19.656
AND THEN I QUIT.

32:20.822 --> 32:23.256
GO AHEAD. IF YOU'RE
NOT HAPPY, QUIT!

32:23.322 --> 32:26.589
I'M TIRED OF TRYING TO MAKE
EVERYBODY HAPPY AROUND HERE!

32:31.522 --> 32:34.656
LAST WEEK, A COLLEAGUE OF MINE
STOMPED A RAT TO DEATH,

32:34.722 --> 32:36.122
AND I CHEERED.

32:36.189 --> 32:38.589
DON'T GET ME WRONG.
I LOVE ANIMALS,

32:38.656 --> 32:41.122
YOU WOULD NEVER CATCH ME
WEARING A FUR COAT,

32:41.189 --> 32:44.222
BUT I DO KNOW
THE FOOD CHAIN.

32:46.089 --> 32:49.222
I'VE HAD FRIENDS
DIE OF CANCER, AIDS,

32:49.289 --> 32:52.256
AND I'M IN FAVOR OF USING
ANIMALS IN LABORATORIES

32:52.322 --> 32:55.956
IF IT WILL HELP US
FIND A CURE FOR THESE
TERRIBLE DISEASES.

32:56.022 --> 32:58.822
BUT AT SOME POINT,
WE DO HAVE TO DRAW A LINE.

32:58.889 --> 33:00.022
WHERE?

33:00.922 --> 33:01.956
I DON'T KNOW.

33:02.022 --> 33:04.322
I WOULD MAKE
FOR A VERY LOUSY JUDGE.

33:04.389 --> 33:07.489
BUT WE ALL MET TINA,
DIDN'T WE?

33:07.556 --> 33:10.422
IF AN ANIMAL CAN THINK,

33:10.489 --> 33:13.822
IF IT CAN PUT A NOUN
TOGETHER WITH A VERB
AND COMMUNICATE,

33:13.889 --> 33:16.656
IF IT CAN FEEL,
AND IF IT CAN LOVE,

33:16.722 --> 33:20.389
IF IT IS SMART ENOUGH TO
UNDERSTAND A LITTLE OF WHAT
THIS HEARING IS ABOUT,

33:20.456 --> 33:24.089
SMART ENOUGH TO LOOK RIGHT BACK
AT YOU AND ASK "WHY?"...

33:24.156 --> 33:27.189
AND WHEN SHE DOES ASK WHY,
IF OUR ONLY ANSWER

33:27.256 --> 33:29.889
IS THAT, WELL, WE'RE HUMAN
AND YOU'RE NOT,

33:29.956 --> 33:33.056
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG.

33:33.122 --> 33:35.922
WE WOULD NEVER SEND
A 2-YEAR-OLD CHILD

33:35.989 --> 33:37.789
TO SOME LABORATORY
FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH

33:37.856 --> 33:41.789
AND NOT JUST BECAUSE
UNDER THE CONSTITUTION
A HUMAN CHILD HAS RIGHTS,

33:41.856 --> 33:45.389
BUT BECAUSE IT WOULD BE
UNTHINKABLE.

33:45.456 --> 33:50.222
SO WHY DOESN'T THE SAME
PRINCIPLE APPLY HERE?

33:50.289 --> 33:52.156
BECAUSE SHE'S INHUMAN?

33:53.522 --> 33:57.622
WELL, THERE'S INHUMAN,
YOUR HONOR,

33:57.689 --> 33:59.456
AND THERE'S INHUMAN.

34:11.389 --> 34:14.856
COUNSEL PRESENTED
A PERSUASIVE MORAL ARGUMENT,

34:14.922 --> 34:17.589
BUT THAT'S ALL IT WAS,
A MORAL ONE.

34:17.656 --> 34:22.188
AND AS SHE'S ADMITTED,
LEGALLY, THEY LOSE.

34:22.255 --> 34:25.255
UNLESS I'M WILLING
TO RE-EXAMINE THE LAW.

34:25.322 --> 34:28.422
YOU COULD DO THAT,
BUT TALK ABOUT
YOUR SLIPPERY SLOPE.

34:28.489 --> 34:34.956
YOUR HONOR, NO MATTER
HOW-HOWEVER MORAL WE TRY
TO PAINT HUMANITY,

34:35.022 --> 34:38.389
WE ARE A SPECIES THAT
KILL ANIMALS FOR FOOD,

34:38.456 --> 34:42.322
FOR CLOTHING, FOR...BELTS,
SHOES, POCKETBOOKS.

34:42.389 --> 34:44.322
WE KILL THEM
FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH.

34:44.389 --> 34:46.056
AND WE KILL THEM
FOR SPORT.

34:46.121 --> 34:48.789
BUT ONCE YOU START SAYING,
"OH, NO, NO, NO.

34:48.856 --> 34:52.422
CERTAIN ANIMALS
SHOULD BE EXEMPT
BECAUSE THEY'RE SMARTER."

34:52.489 --> 34:55.589
WELL, GOOD LUCK.

34:55.656 --> 34:58.322
I MEAN, WHAT KIND OF TEST
DO WE APPLY HERE, DNA?

34:58.389 --> 35:01.222
INTELLIGENCE?
EMOTIONAL CAPACITY?

35:01.289 --> 35:04.656
I--I--WE'RE TALKING OPENING
A FLOODGATE HERE.

35:04.722 --> 35:07.856
I COULD OPEN THE GATE
ONLY FOR THE CHIMPANZEE.

35:07.922 --> 35:09.289
YES, BUT THEN HERE COMES

35:09.356 --> 35:11.122
THE "SAVE THE WHALE"
FOUNDATION

35:11.189 --> 35:12.756
CALLING YOU ARBITRARY.

35:12.822 --> 35:15.689
THE ANIMAL WORLD,
IT'S WONDERFUL,

35:15.756 --> 35:18.089
AND IT'S JUST
FULL OF MIRACLES

35:18.156 --> 35:20.822
AND REASONS FOR US
TO JUST LEAVE THEM ALONE.

35:20.889 --> 35:23.522
LOOK AT EVERY SPECIES
AND YOU'LL FIND
SOMETHING MIRACULOUS,

35:23.589 --> 35:27.422
SOMETHING THAT SAYS,
DON'T SACRIFICE THAT LIFE.

35:28.922 --> 35:31.322
BUT IN A COURT OF LAW,

35:31.389 --> 35:33.956
WE DEAL WITH THE HUMAN RACE,
YOUR HONOR.

35:34.022 --> 35:36.889
LIKE IT OR NOT,
IN THIS ARENA...

35:36.956 --> 35:40.389
IT'S ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS...

35:40.456 --> 35:43.822
AND JUST AS YOU SAID
AT THE BEGINNING
OF ALL OF THIS,

35:43.889 --> 35:45.422
SHE'S A MONKEY.

35:49.956 --> 35:53.056
ONCE WE GET A RECORD
OF TREATMENT,
WE'RE IN THE CLEAR.

35:53.122 --> 35:55.389
OK. THE CHECK COMES IN,
SO WHEN DO I SEE MINE?

35:55.456 --> 35:57.089
YOU GOTTA GET POWER
OF ATTORNEY,

35:57.156 --> 35:59.489
AND ALL THE PAYMENTS
ARE GONNA BE
MADE OUT TO YOU.

35:59.556 --> 36:03.089
I'M NOT SURE I'M
COMFORTABLE WITH THAT
KIND OF PAPER TRAIL.

36:03.156 --> 36:06.989
WELL, WE CAN'T COUNT
ON THE CLIENT
TO CUT AND DIVVY.

36:07.056 --> 36:09.522
LOOK, YOU PAY ME
IN CASH.

36:09.589 --> 36:10.956
I PAY THE DOCTOR.

36:11.022 --> 36:13.856
THAT'S A NO GO.

36:13.922 --> 36:16.889
YOU SEE WHO I'M
IN PRACTICE WITH HERE?

36:16.956 --> 36:19.389
BOBBY DONNELL,
HE'S PRETTY HIGH PROFILE.

36:19.456 --> 36:22.056
HE DOESN'T HAVE
TO KNOW A THING.

36:22.122 --> 36:24.589
ALL HE KNOWS
IS THESE ARE
YOUR CLIENTS.

36:24.656 --> 36:28.856
THAT DOESN'T BRING
EXPOSURE TO YOU OR
ANYBODY ELSE HERE.

36:28.922 --> 36:30.956
I HAVE NEVER HAD A
LAWYER ARRESTED YET.

36:31.022 --> 36:32.089
HE'S PRETTY GOOD.
YES, HE IS.

36:32.156 --> 36:33.656
I'M NOT GONNA START
NOW. BELIEVE ME.

36:33.722 --> 36:36.722
WE'LL START
WITH REBECCA,
SEE HOW IT GOES?

36:39.256 --> 36:41.156
OK.

36:41.789 --> 36:43.556
Bailiff: ALL RISE.

36:47.556 --> 36:50.122
BE SEATED.

36:56.656 --> 37:00.422
I DIDN'T MUCH CARE
FOR THE PERSONALITY
OF YOUR LITTLE APE.

37:00.489 --> 37:03.156
AND, MR. MYRON,
YOU'RE RIGHT.

37:03.222 --> 37:07.022
THE HUMAN RACE RULES
ON THE PLANET
AND IN THIS ROOM.

37:07.089 --> 37:13.056
BUT, AS SUCH, I THINK
JUDGES ARE ALLOWED TO BE
HUMAN ONCE IN A WHILE.

37:16.722 --> 37:19.189
I LOOKED INTO HER EYES.

37:20.689 --> 37:24.089
I'M NOT GOING TO BE
THE ONE TO SEND HER OFF
TO BE EXPERIMENTED ON.

37:24.156 --> 37:27.156
DR. NESBIT, WE NEED TO WORK
OUT A RESTITUTION PLAN,

37:27.222 --> 37:28.722
BUT YOU GET CUSTODY.

37:28.789 --> 37:29.689
[RAPS GAVEL]

37:29.756 --> 37:30.689
ADJOURN.

37:41.156 --> 37:43.489
I MEAN, I'VE HAD WINS,
I'VE HAD BIG WINS.

37:43.556 --> 37:46.056
BUT FOR A MONKEY,
I'M ALMOST CRYING.

37:46.122 --> 37:47.656
RIGHT. CAN IT
BE OVERTURNED?

37:47.722 --> 37:49.056
NO. THEY'RE NOT
GONNA APPEAL.

37:49.122 --> 37:51.422
SPEAKING OF WHICH,
I HAVE THE COURT ORDER.

37:51.489 --> 37:53.922
I'M SUPPOSED TO MEET
THE DOCTOR AT THE CENTER.

37:53.989 --> 37:55.022
ALL RIGHT.

37:55.089 --> 37:56.956
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR DINNER.

37:57.022 --> 37:58.522
CAN I SEE YOU AGAIN?

37:58.589 --> 37:59.956
I'D LOVE THAT.

38:00.022 --> 38:01.556
GREAT.
GREAT.

38:01.622 --> 38:03.222
WELL, I'LL CALL.

38:07.622 --> 38:08.689
BYE.
BYE.

38:08.756 --> 38:10.022
OK.
SEE YA.

38:28.356 --> 38:30.722
SO, BASICALLY,
YOU JUST PLAY IT OUT.

38:30.789 --> 38:33.356
AND AS MUCH AS YOU CAN,
PLAY IT OUT IN THAT ROOM.

38:33.422 --> 38:34.222
OK.

38:34.289 --> 38:35.856
AND NO NEED TO RUSH IT.

38:35.922 --> 38:37.822
JUST LET IT
TAKE ITS OWN COURSE.

38:37.889 --> 38:40.056
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT?

38:41.656 --> 38:43.422
UH...THANKS, JIMMY.

38:43.489 --> 38:45.622
FOR ALL THE BAD BLOOD,
YOU KNOW.

38:45.689 --> 38:47.422
WE'RE ON
THE SAME SIDE NOW.

38:47.489 --> 38:49.556
YEAH, RIGHT.
I'LL BE IN TOUCH.

38:56.089 --> 38:58.189
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO QUIT.

39:00.822 --> 39:03.322
I DON'T WANT
TO LOSE YOU.

39:10.656 --> 39:13.089
I DO BELIEVE IN YOU.

39:13.156 --> 39:15.989
AND I DO BELIEVE
THAT YOU'LL BE
A GOOD PARTNER.

39:16.056 --> 39:21.289
BUT WHEN YOU GET IT,
YOU'LL FEEL BETTER
KNOWING YOU EARNED IT.

39:24.089 --> 39:27.522
I'M TIRED OF BEING
THE BRUNT.

39:27.589 --> 39:31.456
I KNOW I BROUGHT
A LOT OF IT ON MYSELF
WITH THE COMMERCIAL,

39:31.522 --> 39:34.956
BUT I'VE BEEN DOING
GOOD WORK HERE.

39:35.022 --> 39:37.456
WITHOUT A DOUBT.

39:37.522 --> 39:40.789
AND, UH...

39:40.856 --> 39:43.389
I DON'T LIKE
BEING TOLD TO SHUT UP.

39:43.456 --> 39:46.356
I DON'T LIKE EVERYBODY
CALLING ME "BIG HEAD,"

39:46.422 --> 39:48.489
AND I DON'T LIKE
BEING LAUGHED AT.

39:51.389 --> 39:53.856
MAYBE I HAVEN'T EARNED
PARTNER YET,

39:53.922 --> 39:55.422
BUT I'VE EARNED RESPECT...

39:55.489 --> 39:57.756
AND I WANT IT.

39:57.822 --> 40:00.722
JIMMY, EVERYBODY
KIDS YOU BECAUSE...

40:00.789 --> 40:02.489
THEY ADORE YOU.

40:02.556 --> 40:04.456
DON'T YOU KNOW THAT?

40:07.556 --> 40:09.056
I'M NOT A PET.

40:16.989 --> 40:18.189
[DOOR CLOSES]

40:21.989 --> 40:24.856
I DO PLAN ON
PAYING FOR HER.

40:24.922 --> 40:26.489
I KNOW.

40:26.556 --> 40:29.489
KATHY, I DON'T AGREE
WITH THIS RULING,
AND PUBLICLY I'LL DISSENT.

40:29.556 --> 40:31.956
BUT PRIVATELY...

40:32.022 --> 40:34.822
NOW YOU TELL US.

40:34.889 --> 40:36.422
YOU TAKE VERY GOOD
CARE OF HER.

40:36.489 --> 40:37.589
I WILL.

40:45.956 --> 40:48.856
TINA, YOU...ME...

40:48.922 --> 40:51.456
LIVE TOGETHER.

41:17.322 --> 41:19.222
THINK THE PLACE
WILL CHANGE?

41:19.289 --> 41:21.189
A LITTLE,
BUT THAT'S THE POINT.

41:21.256 --> 41:22.789
IN SPIRIT,
WE WON'T CHANGE.

41:22.856 --> 41:24.722
HOW ABOUT
WITH YOU AND ME?

41:24.789 --> 41:25.722
WHAT?

41:27.289 --> 41:29.856
YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND,
LINDSAY.

41:29.922 --> 41:32.622
WHATEVER HAPPENS
WITH YOU AND BOBBY...

41:32.689 --> 41:35.156
IT WON'T AFFECT
YOU AND ME.

42:55.822 --> 42:56.722
YOU STINKER.
