WEBVTT

00:11.077 --> 00:15.036
Aw. Look at them, all nervous.

00:15.081 --> 00:17.641
I remember when I interviewed
to be your assistant.

00:17.684 --> 00:21.313
So, that's the group HR sent me, huh?
Kind of a motley-looking crew.

00:21.354 --> 00:24.346
I only talked to them for a little while,
but I really like Gavin.

00:24.391 --> 00:25.949
Which one's he?

00:33.666 --> 00:36.100
I don't want to do
this interview today.

00:36.136 --> 00:37.535
I'm starting to feel queasy.

00:37.570 --> 00:39.595
Maybe because you're eating

00:39.639 --> 00:41.834
chocolate-covered pretzels
for breakfast.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.900
Thanks, I would have eaten
the whole bag.

00:43.943 --> 00:45.035
Whoo!

00:45.078 --> 00:48.070
See? Which one of
those goobers is gonna do that for me?

00:48.114 --> 00:50.878
Hey, not too long ago,
I was one of those goobers.

00:50.917 --> 00:53.317
All right, promise me
you're gonna pick someone good.

00:53.353 --> 00:54.752
- I promise.
- Good.

00:54.788 --> 00:56.255
Now, do you need anything else?

00:56.289 --> 00:59.315
Actually, fact-checking,
I know you're swamped.

00:59.359 --> 01:00.951
Come on, what kind of editor would I be

01:00.994 --> 01:04.861
if I couldn't do a little fact-checking?
Add it to my pile.

01:06.566 --> 01:09.626
All of it by 2:00? No problemo.

01:11.771 --> 01:15.764
Wow, that's a lot of red ink,
but I'm happy to redo it!

01:18.344 --> 01:22.337
Japanese to English?
I look forward to the challenge.

01:23.316 --> 01:25.341
Wow, look at that giant pile.

01:25.385 --> 01:27.580
I know, and it's carrying
all those papers!

01:27.620 --> 01:30.145
Ignoring and rising above.

01:30.457 --> 01:32.391
What's wrong, Betty?
Now that you're a big fancy editor,

01:32.425 --> 01:34.893
you don't even talk to the little people?

01:34.928 --> 01:37.123
Oh, I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you
over your loud shirt.

01:38.364 --> 01:39.490
Did you just...

01:39.532 --> 01:42.000
Fashion smack by Suarez. Unexpected.

01:42.035 --> 01:45.903
Unlike you, Betty,
I look great in jewel tones.

01:45.939 --> 01:48.134
- What's with the 'tude?
- Well, I've tried being nice to you,

01:48.174 --> 01:51.143
but since my promotion, all you do
is insult me and sabotage me.

01:51.177 --> 01:53.145
So, I'm done with you.

01:54.547 --> 01:56.515
- I really like this side of her.
- Do you mind?

01:57.917 --> 01:59.782
- Sorry.
- No, no, no, it was my bad.

01:59.819 --> 02:02.083
But, here, here, let me help.

02:06.559 --> 02:11.155
Oh, I was wondering if you had any
feature ideas for the New York issue?

02:11.865 --> 02:14.026
What, you mean, like,
to write an article?

02:14.067 --> 02:16.331
- Yeah, unless you're too busy with...
- Oh, no!

02:16.369 --> 02:18.735
No, I would love to write an article.

02:18.771 --> 02:20.363
Actually, I've been working
on this concept

02:20.406 --> 02:23.375
about the unsung heroes of New York,

02:23.409 --> 02:25.001
people who do the toughest jobs.

02:25.044 --> 02:28.275
And we could showcase
their uniforms for a fashion angle.

02:28.314 --> 02:31.010
"New York's 10 Most Thankless Jobs. "

02:31.050 --> 02:33.143
- Sounds perfect.
- Really?

02:33.219 --> 02:34.516
Mmm-hmm.

02:35.889 --> 02:39.848
Wow, thanks.
Okay, great. Well, I'll get to work.

02:40.226 --> 02:44.822
Oh, and, Matt, I'm really glad
that we, you know.

02:45.198 --> 02:46.688
Yeah, me, too.

02:51.437 --> 02:54.736
Oh, hey, Matt! I really like your haircut.

02:54.774 --> 02:57.766
Just looks so healthy,
makes me want to pull it!

02:57.810 --> 02:59.869
Actually,
I didn't get a haircut.

02:59.913 --> 03:02.575
Ow, wow. That kind of hurts.
Thank you.

03:03.950 --> 03:05.042
Bye.

03:07.854 --> 03:09.845
Oh, my God, Mandy,
you were, like, five seconds away

03:09.889 --> 03:12.449
from flipping his omelet
right here on the desk.

03:12.492 --> 03:13.789
You love him.

03:13.826 --> 03:18.263
Please. He's tainted.
Kissing him would be like kissing Betty.

03:23.269 --> 03:24.736
- Oh, Betty.
- Yes?

03:24.771 --> 03:26.363
Daniel's been looking for you.

03:26.406 --> 03:27.964
He wants you to meet
the new assistant.

03:28.007 --> 03:30.771
Oh! He picked someone? Yay!
Is it Gavin?

03:32.078 --> 03:33.773
I don't think so.

03:35.000 --> 03:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:55.602 --> 03:58.537
Hi, are you Daniel's new assistant?

03:59.372 --> 04:02.000
Lexie, like, "Sexy. "

04:02.508 --> 04:07.741
Oh, I see. Um...
Well, I'm Betty, like, "Confetti!"

04:08.414 --> 04:11.975
I'm Daniel's old assistant,
so I'm more than happy to help you.

04:12.018 --> 04:15.647
- I can show you how things work.
- I know how things work.

04:16.456 --> 04:18.447
I'm sure you'll be fine.

04:22.962 --> 04:25.487
Hey, Betty. Oh, did you meet Lexie yet?

04:25.531 --> 04:28.591
Lexie, like, "Sexy"?
Yes, we met. Daniel!

04:28.635 --> 04:30.865
- What?
- What happened to Gavin?

04:30.903 --> 04:35.340
Of all the people HR sent over,
that's who you picked?

04:35.908 --> 04:37.933
Looks had nothing to do with it.

04:37.977 --> 04:40.537
I can't believe you would
even think that. I'm a widower, Betty.

04:40.580 --> 04:42.912
You certainly didn't pick her
because she's friendly.

04:42.949 --> 04:45.645
Well, maybe
she's just intimidated by you.

04:45.685 --> 04:49.553
I mean, I told her
she had some pretty big shoes to fill.

04:49.589 --> 04:51.750
She nailed the interview.
Totally helpful.

04:51.858 --> 04:53.917
Let me get that for you.

04:56.629 --> 05:00.030
I mean, just because she's pretty
doesn't mean she's not qualified.

05:00.066 --> 05:03.263
You should know, judging a book
by its cover works both ways.

05:03.303 --> 05:07.034
I'm sure if you think she's capable,
then she'll be great.

05:17.450 --> 05:18.747
Where the hell have you been?

05:18.785 --> 05:21.185
Can't I go out to get
some frozen yogurt?

05:21.220 --> 05:24.121
If you can go a couple of weeks
without murdering any boyfriends.

05:25.391 --> 05:26.483
Did you talk to anyone?

05:26.526 --> 05:29.154
You know me.
Just get one frozen yogurt in me

05:29.195 --> 05:31.561
and I just tell all my secrets.

05:32.065 --> 05:34.226
Is this a joke to you?

05:34.267 --> 05:37.168
You will not be laughing
when we're both in jail, young lady.

05:37.203 --> 05:42.106
- Mom, it was 20 minutes.
- I ask you to do one thing, stay put.

05:42.608 --> 05:45.372
Nico, after everything I've done for you.

05:45.411 --> 05:49.438
Boarding school in France,
taking you in when you needed help...

05:49.482 --> 05:52.144
I'm sorry, it won't happen again.

05:52.518 --> 05:54.748
You're right, it won't happen again,

05:54.787 --> 05:58.223
because from now on,
you don't leave my side.

06:03.229 --> 06:05.823
That's it. Now you just type in
your password right there,

06:05.865 --> 06:07.457
and that's how you check your e-mail.

06:07.500 --> 06:09.525
So, what's my password again?

06:09.569 --> 06:12.697
"Ignacio Rules. "
- Just wanted to hear you say that.

06:13.906 --> 06:15.931
Hey, look at that!

06:16.075 --> 06:17.804
<i>Guess papi's more modern
than you thought.</i>

06:17.844 --> 06:21.302
Yes, congratulations.
You have mastered e-mail.

06:21.647 --> 06:23.410
Welcome to 1993.

06:23.616 --> 06:27.347
Hey, I think it's very cool that
you're learning to use the computer.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.116
You are in a mood.

06:35.661 --> 06:37.629
- What?
- It's Archie.

06:37.663 --> 06:39.824
I never get to see him anymore.
He's too busy campaigning

06:39.866 --> 06:41.458
and canvassing the neighborhood.

06:41.501 --> 06:43.264
I'll tell you one neighborhood
he isn't canvassing,

06:43.302 --> 06:44.360
if you know what I mean.

06:45.505 --> 06:46.836
What? It's passion.

06:46.873 --> 06:51.105
Without it, relationships fizzle,
and I don't want that to happen to us.

06:52.445 --> 06:55.107
Maybe he's not attracted
to me anymore.

06:55.148 --> 06:57.582
What, are you crazy? Look at you.

06:59.285 --> 07:01.276
Yeah, that would be pretty crazy.

07:03.156 --> 07:05.624
<i>Mi hija, more coffee?
You're gonna be up all night.</i>

07:05.658 --> 07:08.525
It's the only way
I'm gonna make it through.

07:08.561 --> 07:10.119
I have all this work to do

07:10.163 --> 07:11.892
and I haven't even started
writing my article.

07:11.931 --> 07:13.956
Just have the people below you do it.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.525
- Isn't that what editors do?
- Justin, I'm a junior editor.

07:16.569 --> 07:18.628
There's no one lower than me
in my department.

07:18.671 --> 07:20.536
There is always
someone lower than you.

07:20.573 --> 07:23.633
In junior high, the drama kids seemed
like the bottom of the food chain,

07:23.676 --> 07:25.871
but we weren't.
There was always the band

07:25.912 --> 07:27.675
and the Renaissance Fair nerds.

07:27.713 --> 07:32.150
I did Renaissance Fair!
I was one of the Queen's dancers!

07:32.318 --> 07:35.116
So, Betty, who's below you?

07:35.188 --> 07:37.850
There is a pool of assistants
that junior editors can use,

07:37.890 --> 07:40.984
but I don't want it to look like
I can't handle my own work.

07:41.027 --> 07:44.929
<i>Mi hija, it is not a sign of weakness
to ask for help.</i>

07:50.102 --> 07:52.229
Margaret, I know you hate your life,

07:52.271 --> 07:55.570
but does everything you pick out
have to be so dreary?

07:55.608 --> 07:58.372
Don't come back until you get it right.

08:02.849 --> 08:05.613
Great pep talk!
Everyone looked real scared.

08:05.651 --> 08:08.916
Hey, Willie, can I talk to you
about something?

08:08.955 --> 08:11.549
I just ran into Tall Paul from styles

08:11.591 --> 08:13.422
who was talking to Fat Pat
from accounting

08:13.459 --> 08:15.188
who heard on good authority
from Gay Renee...

08:15.228 --> 08:16.252
Oh, just say it!

08:16.295 --> 08:18.923
Hartley and Claire were having dinner
with Isabelle Besset last night!

08:20.500 --> 08:22.991
Word is she's replacing you.
What are we gonna do?

08:23.035 --> 08:25.196
What's the plan? Blackmail?

08:26.706 --> 08:29.834
I've been trying to get dirt
on Isabelle for years.

08:29.876 --> 08:31.537
She's clean as a whistle.

08:32.778 --> 08:35.076
Then what? Hartley and Claire
think you're the enemy.

08:35.114 --> 08:39.174
Marc! We will just have to
convince them that I'm not the enemy,

08:39.217 --> 08:41.118
remind them I'm a team player.

08:44.690 --> 08:46.624
- You're serious?
- Yes!

08:46.659 --> 08:48.991
I can turn on the charm if I want.

08:49.028 --> 08:53.328
While I'm on shaky ground, it wouldn't
kill me to kiss Claire's bony ass.

08:53.366 --> 08:57.928
So, your plan is being nice?

08:59.038 --> 09:00.130
Yes.

09:01.274 --> 09:03.799
I'm just gonna give you some space,

09:04.977 --> 09:08.708
some time, so you can
hatch up something else.

09:08.748 --> 09:09.772
Okay.

09:09.849 --> 09:13.114
Speaking of things you've hatched,
Nico is here.

09:14.186 --> 09:17.485
Yes, I brought her in
to learn about fashion.

09:17.790 --> 09:20.953
Go grab her a chair.
She'll be quiet as a mouse.

09:21.561 --> 09:22.960
Okay, sure.

09:26.666 --> 09:29.032
So, Nico, what you been doing
since boarding school?

09:29.068 --> 09:30.933
What brings you back?

09:31.070 --> 09:33.664
Wilhelmina? I'm sorry to interrupt.

09:33.973 --> 09:37.067
Don't be sorry. Being sorry takes time.
Just spit it out.

09:37.143 --> 09:39.839
Well, I've requested
an assistant from the pool,

09:39.879 --> 09:41.972
but HR says you have to sign off on it.

09:42.014 --> 09:45.541
But you never stay with your mom
for this long. Is it boy trouble?

09:45.585 --> 09:48.452
Didn't you meet some guy
backpacking through Europe?

09:48.487 --> 09:50.546
Whatever happened to him?

09:52.325 --> 09:55.852
You need an assistant? Done.
Walk this way.

09:55.895 --> 10:00.059
Really? Wow, thank you!
I have so much editorial work.

10:00.099 --> 10:03.535
I had no idea that...
Oh, I thought we were walking.

10:03.569 --> 10:06.697
We're here. Marc, I need to reassign
you for a few days.

10:06.739 --> 10:09.936
- Reassign me?
- Oh, no, no. No, no, no. I...

10:09.976 --> 10:14.208
Yes. Betty here needs an assistant,
and you are it.

10:30.663 --> 10:32.426
I cannot be Betty's assistant!

10:32.465 --> 10:35.866
It goes against the natural
order of things. She-diculous!

10:35.901 --> 10:37.266
I made my decision, Marc.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.771
Is this because I told you
about a certain French editor

10:39.805 --> 10:43.434
who might be replacing you?
Do not punish the messenger, Willie!

10:43.476 --> 10:45.842
It's a good learning experience
for Nico to man the desk.

10:45.878 --> 10:47.505
Besides, you're always complaining

10:47.546 --> 10:49.673
that you want more
editorial responsibility,

10:49.715 --> 10:51.546
and Betty needs help with the feature.

10:51.584 --> 10:52.778
Um...

10:52.818 --> 10:55.719
You know what?
I can do this by myself.

10:55.755 --> 10:59.122
Betty, you might have been
a star assistant, but as an editor,

10:59.158 --> 11:01.854
you have failed to produce
one single item for this magazine.

11:01.961 --> 11:03.519
You want help? Here it is.

11:03.562 --> 11:05.189
I don't want to hear
another word about it.

11:05.231 --> 11:07.791
Betty's in charge,
so shut up and get out!

11:08.000 --> 11:10.264
- I want to...
- I said get out!

11:13.806 --> 11:15.273
- Very mature.
- Just because

11:15.307 --> 11:16.638
I'm your temporary assistant,

11:16.676 --> 11:18.667
does not mean
I'm getting you coffee, got it?

11:18.711 --> 11:20.941
<i>- I could have been an editor at V!
- V?</i>

11:20.980 --> 11:24.108
A certain magazine whose name
shall not be said, rhymes with "rogue"?

11:24.150 --> 11:26.141
Dante Nelli Jr. Himself offered me a job.

11:26.185 --> 11:29.313
Dante Nelli Jr., a man so fabulous,
he wears a kaftan every day of the year.

11:29.355 --> 11:31.585
<i>And I said, "No, thanks, Dante,
I'd rather be at Mode</i>

11:31.624 --> 11:34.184
- "doing grunt work for Betty Suarez!"
- You know what, Marc?

11:34.226 --> 11:37.195
This is awkward for me, too,
but I could actually use your help.

11:37.229 --> 11:39.288
I need to trim 100 words
from the Trends column.

11:39.331 --> 11:43.392
- Maybe you could help me with that!
- I could do that in my sleep!

11:45.137 --> 11:46.900
Hey, Lexie, I'm gonna pop down
to the cafeteria

11:46.939 --> 11:49.965
- to have lunch with my friend Natalie.
- I'm on the phone.

11:50.009 --> 11:52.637
- What was it you were saying?
- Oh! Uh...

11:52.678 --> 11:56.273
Okay. Anyway, I'll be back
in an hour or so. Okay?

11:58.017 --> 12:01.544
Sorry, my new boss.
Yabbering on about something.

12:04.223 --> 12:08.023
Mother, would you please take off
your sunglasses? It's embarrassing.

12:09.695 --> 12:12.027
I can't believe
you dragged me down here.

12:12.064 --> 12:14.555
What kind of sad people
eat in cafeterias?

12:14.834 --> 12:17.462
Hello, hello! Wilhelmina!

12:17.770 --> 12:21.171
Well, well. Scooch over there a second,
would you, please?

12:21.207 --> 12:24.643
- Thank you.
- Wow, Claire! What a nice surprise.

12:24.677 --> 12:27.145
- This is my daughter, Nico.
- Hello, Nico.

12:27.179 --> 12:29.170
Hello.
- It's nice to meet you, dear.

12:29.215 --> 12:31.046
Surprised to see you
down here, Wilhelmina.

12:31.083 --> 12:33.381
What are you,
eating amongst the commoners?

12:35.988 --> 12:37.888
You're too funny!

12:37.923 --> 12:41.324
I would bust a rib
if I hadn't had them all removed!

12:42.528 --> 12:44.689
Could we talk business
for just a minute?

12:44.730 --> 12:48.188
We like the New York issue, but
we are a little concerned about sales.

12:48.300 --> 12:52.236
Now, Cal has an idea, so try to
keep an open mind about this.

12:52.271 --> 12:54.364
<i>Get on with it, you old bag.</i>

12:54.406 --> 12:59.742
Well, every book or movie
I see these days is about vampires.

12:59.779 --> 13:02.179
It just... It's a total cash cow.

13:02.214 --> 13:07.379
<i>Now, what if we put a vampire
on the cover of Mode?</i>

13:07.419 --> 13:09.216
<i>You've gotta be
kidding me.</i>

13:09.255 --> 13:11.621
Hmm.

13:11.657 --> 13:16.060
So, the New York theme
becomes "Gothic Gotham. "

13:16.095 --> 13:20.088
Keep the fashion,
but give our cover girl some fangs.

13:20.466 --> 13:24.869
<i>Worst idea ever.
Oh, wait, it's my turn to talk.</i>

13:25.070 --> 13:27.664
- I love it!
- You do?

13:27.706 --> 13:31.005
Cal and I thought we might get
some pushback from you on this.

13:31.043 --> 13:33.910
I know a great idea when I hear one.

13:33.946 --> 13:38.246
Wilhelmina Slater is
and will always be a team player.

13:41.720 --> 13:45.019
I am crazy for Tater Tots. You want one?

13:45.191 --> 13:47.955
Uh, I don't know
if that can be called grief eating.

13:47.993 --> 13:52.293
- You're in way too good of a mood.
- You know what? I am.

13:52.932 --> 13:56.959
I've been going to hear this guy
give these inspirational talks, and...

13:57.203 --> 13:59.933
- Yeah?
- I don't know. He's kind of great.

13:59.972 --> 14:02.372
He teaches you
how to cope with all sorts of stuff.

14:02.408 --> 14:05.070
Addiction, divorce. Mmm.

14:05.110 --> 14:10.377
If you're curious, there's actually a talk
this afternoon about losing loved ones.

14:10.716 --> 14:14.015
Wow, "the Community of the Phoenix.

14:14.053 --> 14:18.285
"Rise up from the ashes
of your life and soar!"

14:18.858 --> 14:23.818
You think it's cheesy, New Agey?
I know, I know. Forget the brochure.

14:24.530 --> 14:26.691
It's really been helping me
work through some stuff.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.230
Okay, you just scoffed at me.

14:30.636 --> 14:32.194
I'm not, not scoffing.

14:32.238 --> 14:34.138
Okay, whatever. You know what?
Never mind.

14:34.173 --> 14:36.641
You're probably
not ready for it anyway.

14:36.675 --> 14:38.438
Oh, and what makes you think
I'm not ready?

14:38.477 --> 14:41.469
Of course I'm ready!
Besides, what can it hurt, right?

14:41.513 --> 14:42.775
Right.

14:52.491 --> 14:54.118
- Hi, Hilda.
- Shh!

14:54.293 --> 14:58.923
Hi! Do you remember that Halloween
when I was the sexy superhero?

14:58.964 --> 15:00.932
Remember all those guys
were groping me?

15:00.966 --> 15:03.127
Yeah.
That was the year I went as DNA.

15:03.168 --> 15:07.696
Oh, yeah, that was sad.
Anyway, where are those sassy boots?

15:09.241 --> 15:11.471
- Why?
- I am gonna text Archie

15:11.510 --> 15:15.276
a sexy picture of myself, you know,
put a little air in his tires.

15:15.314 --> 15:17.646
Hilda, sexting?

15:17.683 --> 15:20.015
What, please!
It's not like I'm gonna be nude.

15:20.052 --> 15:22.350
It's gonna be tasteful, PG-13.

15:22.388 --> 15:26.848
I'm not giving away the whole
fruit basket, Betty, just the nectarines.

15:26.892 --> 15:29.258
Classy. The boots are in the attic.
I've gotta go, bye.

15:29.295 --> 15:30.387
Bye!

15:33.499 --> 15:38.129
While you were on your personal call,
I finished the Trends column.

15:38.570 --> 15:39.696
Oh!

15:41.006 --> 15:42.769
You cut the whole intro?

15:42.808 --> 15:45.675
You know what? I don't miss it.
Good idea.

15:45.711 --> 15:47.235
Great idea.

15:49.214 --> 15:50.806
- What?
- Nothing.

15:51.784 --> 15:54.685
It's just that it's bad enough I have to
watch you get promoted above me

15:54.720 --> 15:57.018
without having
any knowledge of fashion,

15:57.056 --> 15:59.149
but now I have to have your ineptitude
rubbed in my face.

15:59.191 --> 16:01.557
You know what, Marc? I'm not gonna
keep having this argument with you.

16:01.593 --> 16:05.188
I know I'm not perfect, but Daniel and
Wilhelmina picked me for a reason.

16:05.230 --> 16:08.722
Yeah. Daniel's name is on the building
and you two are lovers.

16:08.767 --> 16:11.600
You know, I have half a mind
to march into Daniel's office right now

16:11.637 --> 16:14.299
and put this issue to rest
once and for all.

16:14.340 --> 16:15.864
I would love to see
the look on your face

16:15.908 --> 16:17.466
when Daniel says they gave me the job

16:17.509 --> 16:20.342
because they thought I would be
a better editor than you.

16:20.379 --> 16:22.472
Okay, I would love to hear him
say those words.

16:22.514 --> 16:23.606
- Fine!
- Fine!

16:23.649 --> 16:24.741
Fine!

16:24.783 --> 16:27.911
- No, you're both so qualified, it was...
- Just give us the truth.

16:27.953 --> 16:30.513
Your vote trumped Wilhelmina's, right?
Because you're a Meade.

16:30.556 --> 16:33.616
Or was it simply that
I had more potential as an editor?

16:33.659 --> 16:36.594
It was a very
hard decision for us to make.

16:36.662 --> 16:39.756
Why are you
sparing their feelings, Daniel?

16:40.866 --> 16:42.458
We tossed a coin.

16:42.501 --> 16:46.062
And you got your job, Betty,
because you were tails.

16:55.614 --> 16:58.082
Now, you know I wanted you in this job.

16:58.117 --> 17:00.677
The coin toss, it's the only way
to break the impasse.

17:00.719 --> 17:03.517
I know, I know. It's just,
the only thing keeping me going

17:03.555 --> 17:06.079
was the feeling
that I actually deserve this.

17:06.125 --> 17:10.960
Betty, wait, wait, wait.
You do deserve this, believe me.

17:11.663 --> 17:13.493
Yeah, I know. I know.

17:13.866 --> 17:16.960
Good. Look, I have to run
to my layout meeting.

17:17.002 --> 17:20.368
- Are you sure you're gonna be all right?
- Yeah. Yes.

17:20.772 --> 17:22.137
All right.

17:24.609 --> 17:27.374
Hey, Tails!
I'm so happy that we cleared that up.

17:27.413 --> 17:29.176
You're not better than me,
you're just lucky!

17:29.214 --> 17:32.377
You're nothing more than tails,
the buttocks of a quarter.

17:32.418 --> 17:34.613
Oh! Hey, guys.
Betty, how's your article going?

17:34.653 --> 17:36.883
Great! I've already set up
a bunch of interviews

17:36.922 --> 17:39.015
with some of the toughest
working people in the city,

17:39.058 --> 17:40.889
and I'm going down there
to see firsthand.

17:40.959 --> 17:42.426
Great, and while you're down there,

17:42.461 --> 17:45.055
why don't you see if they'll let you
actually do some of the jobs?

17:45.097 --> 17:46.928
Oh! Okay, like a first-person piece?

17:46.965 --> 17:49.695
Yeah, and you should wear all
the humiliating clothes that they wear.

17:49.735 --> 17:52.602
Take lots of pictures of it
to document the whole thing.

17:52.638 --> 17:54.697
That's a great idea, Marc.

17:55.941 --> 17:59.433
See, some people just know
how to think like an editor.

17:59.912 --> 18:02.642
Can you get my messages
for me, please?

18:06.018 --> 18:07.383
Thank you.

18:08.053 --> 18:12.490
Hello, Mr. Candidate!
Did you get the picture that I sent you?

18:12.524 --> 18:15.516
- Yes, I got it, and so did everyone else!
- What?

18:15.594 --> 18:18.825
You hit "Reply all" to one of
my campaign emails, Hilda!

18:18.864 --> 18:20.627
That picture went
to my entire distro list!

18:20.699 --> 18:22.098
Oh, my God!

18:22.134 --> 18:23.260
Hello? Hey, Hilda!

18:23.302 --> 18:24.599
<i>Hilda,
this is the absolute worst thing</i>

18:24.636 --> 18:26.661
<i>that could happen at this point
in my campaign.</i>

18:26.705 --> 18:28.332
<i>- This is terrible.
- Just checking my e-mail.</i>

18:28.373 --> 18:31.467
Archie, Archie, you've gotta get that
e- mail back. I'm not decent!

18:31.510 --> 18:35.776
I can't get it back! And now everyone,
including the kids I volunteer with,

18:35.814 --> 18:38.442
are opening up their e-mails
and finding a picture of your boobs!

18:38.484 --> 18:41.248
"Lgnacio Rules. "

18:41.286 --> 18:44.187
I can't talk right now, okay?
Just meet me later, okay?

18:44.223 --> 18:47.283
- Okay.
- Hey, I got something from you!

18:47.326 --> 18:50.261
It's a picture!
Where are my reading glasses?

18:50.295 --> 18:52.160
No!

18:54.600 --> 18:58.900
- Hey, Lexie, how about a cup of coffee?
- Oh, yeah, I'd love one, thanks.

18:59.605 --> 19:01.197
Um... Okay.

19:02.207 --> 19:04.198
- Finished your fact-checking.
- Thanks.

19:04.243 --> 19:06.939
So, you're getting her coffee now?

19:06.979 --> 19:10.540
Yeah, you know what? I don't think
it's working out so well with Lexie.

19:10.582 --> 19:13.107
Which is weird because I'm usually
such a good judge of character.

19:13.152 --> 19:15.416
- Yeah.
- I picked you, didn't I?

19:15.521 --> 19:18.820
Ah! No, not exactly.
Your father picked me.

19:18.857 --> 19:22.725
Precisely so that you wouldn't do
what you always do,

19:22.761 --> 19:25.821
which is hire an assistant
that you want to sleep with.

19:25.864 --> 19:28.799
- Really?
- Is that why you hired me?

19:30.035 --> 19:32.435
- Hey, Lexie!
- You're disgusting!

19:32.804 --> 19:33.930
No, no. No.

19:33.972 --> 19:36.964
Oh, my God,
I didn't know she was right there!

19:37.009 --> 19:39.842
Do you want me to go
say something to her?

19:40.445 --> 19:43.812
No, you're busy. My problem.
I can handle it.

19:47.986 --> 19:51.319
Lexie, I really need to apologize to you.

19:52.224 --> 19:55.091
You heard something out of context
and I really want you to know

19:55.127 --> 19:56.958
that's not the reason I hired you.

19:56.995 --> 19:59.327
And I promise you,
the more you get to know me,

19:59.364 --> 20:02.595
the more you'll realize
I'm just not like that, okay?

20:10.409 --> 20:12.934
- What is wrong with you?
- No, no. No!

20:12.978 --> 20:14.445
You think you can just grab me?

20:14.479 --> 20:16.572
It was an accident.
I was trying to reach for your shoulder.

20:16.615 --> 20:21.109
- You dirty old man!
- No, no, Lexie, I'm sorry!

20:21.153 --> 20:22.984
Old? What...

20:27.459 --> 20:29.723
- Tails!
- Will you stop doing that?

20:29.761 --> 20:33.561
Come on, it's time for you to do
the 10 worst jobs in New York City!

21:12.304 --> 21:15.671
Mr. Badlani? Hi, I'm Betty Suarez.

21:15.707 --> 21:18.938
We spoke on the phone.
I'm here to be your hot dog hostess.

21:19.011 --> 21:20.979
"Taj Ma Hot Dog.

21:21.013 --> 21:23.743
"Delicious meat-substitute hot dogs. "

21:23.782 --> 21:25.807
- Sounds tasty.
- Thank you.

21:26.084 --> 21:27.949
Now, I know it's chilly today,

21:27.986 --> 21:30.716
but it can get mighty sticky inside
that hot dog suit.

21:30.789 --> 21:33.849
I'm sorry,
there's an actual hot dog suit?

21:33.925 --> 21:36.860
Oh, just when I thought this day
couldn't get sweeter.

21:36.895 --> 21:38.886
Now, which one of you
is going to be the wiener

21:38.930 --> 21:40.625
and which one is going to be the bun?

21:40.666 --> 21:42.327
- What?
- It's a two-man costume.

21:42.367 --> 21:44.460
You can't have a wiener
without the bun.

21:44.503 --> 21:46.095
Oh!

21:46.138 --> 21:47.662
- You heard the man.
- No!

21:47.706 --> 21:50.903
You wear the stupid costumes.
It's your article. You're the editor.

21:50.942 --> 21:53.308
You're right, Marc, I am the editor.

21:53.345 --> 21:57.543
And while I've been doing the hardest
jobs in New York all day long,

21:57.582 --> 22:00.016
you have been doing nothing at all!

22:00.052 --> 22:01.679
But you heard Wilhelmina,
I'm in charge.

22:01.720 --> 22:05.451
So suit up 'cause I'm the boss,
and you're the bun!

22:10.696 --> 22:14.632
- Well, what do you think?
- You look great.

22:16.902 --> 22:20.303
But please don't eat
in front of the customers.

22:20.339 --> 22:23.775
A hot dog eating a hot dog?
It freaks them out.

22:25.377 --> 22:27.504
Okay. Well, what do I do?

22:27.546 --> 22:30.674
Greet customers?
Hand out some coupons?

22:30.716 --> 22:32.843
That doesn't seem so hard.

22:33.552 --> 22:34.712
Ow!

22:35.487 --> 22:37.478
Sometimes that happens.

22:39.224 --> 22:43.558
- Now where is my bun?
- Bun, we need you!

22:43.962 --> 22:46.726
We can't have a hot dog without a bun!

22:48.667 --> 22:51.602
Aw, there you are!

22:51.803 --> 22:55.671
Unlike you, Betty, who wears
ridiculous get-ups on a daily basis,

22:55.707 --> 22:58.107
I have a reputation to protect.

23:00.045 --> 23:03.276
Come on, Marc, you look adorable.
Good enough to eat!

23:04.516 --> 23:07.610
- What the hell is that?
- It's the hot dog music!

23:08.453 --> 23:11.217
Come on, I'll show you the dance steps.

23:14.426 --> 23:15.893
Hmm.

23:16.762 --> 23:19.424
It still doesn't read "vampire" to me.

23:19.464 --> 23:23.833
Maybe sharper fangs and

23:25.337 --> 23:27.965
maybe we should add some blood
to the front of the dress.

23:28.006 --> 23:31.339
Oh, I agree! Good idea, Claire.
Mmm-hmm.

23:33.445 --> 23:35.003
Don't you dare.

23:35.614 --> 23:40.278
- Nico! What are you doing?
- It wasn't on purpose! I...

23:40.318 --> 23:42.081
Don't you have enough blood
on your hands?

23:42.120 --> 23:46.716
Mom, do not get all pissy with me just
because you hate this vampire idea.

23:46.758 --> 23:48.350
God, it's not my fault!

23:48.393 --> 23:50.759
Actually, it is.
I'm hanging on by a thread,

23:50.796 --> 23:52.889
doing everything I can to keep my job.

23:52.931 --> 23:54.796
Because without my job,
I can't help you.

23:54.833 --> 23:56.858
It's all for you. So I'm making nice,

23:56.902 --> 23:59.803
even though this vampire shoot
is ridiculous!

23:59.838 --> 24:04.002
Ridiculous?
What happened to loving the concept?

24:04.042 --> 24:08.570
I do! I am 100% on board. Team player!

24:08.680 --> 24:11.945
We ran this idea by you
because we wanted your blunt opinion.

24:11.983 --> 24:14.679
Well, how the hell am I supposed
to give you my honest opinion

24:14.719 --> 24:17.745
knowing that Isabelle Besset
can replace me any minute?

24:17.823 --> 24:19.723
I had a feeling you might have
heard about that.

24:19.758 --> 24:22.192
- You want to know the truth?
- Yes.

24:23.094 --> 24:25.392
This is juvenile.

24:25.430 --> 24:28.399
You put this on the cover,
and it damages the brand.

24:28.433 --> 24:31.334
<i>Mode does not follow trends,
we set them.</i>

24:32.671 --> 24:35.401
All right. I'll talk to Cal.

24:36.241 --> 24:38.675
- You're agreeing with me?
- Yes.

24:40.245 --> 24:43.476
And now you do something for me.
Trim the budget.

24:43.782 --> 24:46.512
Start by cutting 10 pages of content.

24:48.720 --> 24:52.588
Oh! And, Wilhelmina? Just do your job,

24:53.658 --> 24:55.683
while you still have it.

25:02.434 --> 25:03.958
Okay, five, six, seven, eight!

25:14.613 --> 25:17.343
As much as I love
giant wieners flying at me,

25:17.382 --> 25:21.910
- this is a little outside my comfort zone.
- You didn't even try to catch me, Marc!

25:21.987 --> 25:25.479
It's not my fault you can't count.
You were two full measures early!

25:25.557 --> 25:27.525
- Oh, now I can't count.
- No, you can't count.

25:27.559 --> 25:31.859
And you can't dance. And you certainly
can't edit a fashion magazine.

25:32.464 --> 25:34.227
What is it with you, Marc?

25:34.266 --> 25:36.564
You know, if the coin toss
would have gone the other way,

25:36.601 --> 25:40.298
if you would have been promoted,
I would have just been happy for you.

25:40.338 --> 25:44.399
- Why can't you just be happy for me?
- Why should I be happy for you?

25:44.442 --> 25:46.239
Yeah, of course the coin
landed on you.

25:46.278 --> 25:48.109
You're like the luckiest person
in the world!

25:48.146 --> 25:49.909
You have a great job, great family.

25:49.948 --> 25:53.543
Multiple attractive men have
wanted to date you, God knows why.

25:55.453 --> 25:59.947
I can't catch a break.
I'm always the bun.

26:02.127 --> 26:05.927
- Come on, Marc, it's not that bad.
- Don't "happy Betty" me!

26:06.798 --> 26:09.164
You want to talk thankless jobs
in New York City?

26:09.200 --> 26:13.364
Try being Wilhelmina Slater's gofer
for five years!

26:13.405 --> 26:15.464
And the worst part of it is,
I could have been editor

26:15.507 --> 26:18.067
at the magazine whose name
shall not be mentioned.

26:18.109 --> 26:22.569
I could have been protégé to the most
fashionable man in publishing.

26:22.781 --> 26:25.409
My style icon, Dante Nelli Jr.

26:25.984 --> 26:27.178
Yes?

26:34.659 --> 26:37.287
You grabbed her boob?
- No, I didn't grab it.

26:37.329 --> 26:40.787
- I just... I sort of... I grazed it.
- Daniel!

26:40.832 --> 26:43.062
It was an accident!
I was going to apologize!

26:43.101 --> 26:45.399
We don't care
how bad an assistant she is,

26:45.437 --> 26:48.463
if you grabbed, grazed
or looked sideways at that boob,

26:48.506 --> 26:50.565
you cannot fire her.

26:50.609 --> 26:53.442
You'll have a big lawsuit
on your hands.

26:56.147 --> 27:00.208
I'm so, so sorry.
I feel terrible about this!

27:00.251 --> 27:02.617
The last thing
I wanted to do was hurt you.

27:02.654 --> 27:05.248
- I just, I didn't think...
- That's right, Hilda. You didn't think.

27:05.590 --> 27:07.057
I know you didn't mean
for this to happen,

27:07.092 --> 27:09.322
but do you know what photos
like this do to campaigns?

27:09.361 --> 27:11.420
This is a big embarrassment for me!

27:11.463 --> 27:14.455
Well, nobody could be
as embarrassed about this as me!

27:14.499 --> 27:16.490
It's my picture people are talking about!

27:16.534 --> 27:18.627
Well, then why did you do it?

27:18.670 --> 27:22.697
You've been so busy lately,
I just wanted us to be closer!

27:22.741 --> 27:26.142
You know, I wanted you to be
excited about us again!

27:26.411 --> 27:29.209
I'm sorry
if I'm an embarrassment to you.

27:37.322 --> 27:40.655
- I'm surprised you remembered me!
- Of course I do.

27:40.692 --> 27:43.183
It's not often that someone
refuses a job from us,

27:43.228 --> 27:45.355
but you said
you had to pursue your dream,

27:45.397 --> 27:48.992
which apparently is selling hot dogs.

27:49.634 --> 27:50.726
Oh! Uh...

27:50.769 --> 27:54.466
<i>No. I don't work here. I'm still at Mode.</i>

27:54.506 --> 27:55.996
They finally made you editor?

27:57.342 --> 28:00.311
Ah. Still picking up
Wilhelmina's dry cleaning.

28:00.345 --> 28:03.109
<i>Actually, Marc was so valuable at Mode</i>

28:03.148 --> 28:05.946
that we just added him
to the features department.

28:05.984 --> 28:09.044
We're doing a story right now
on the hardest jobs in New York.

28:09.087 --> 28:11.885
That's why we're in
these crazy costumes.

28:12.323 --> 28:16.453
Features? Well, good for you.
Congratulations.

28:16.928 --> 28:21.228
You know, I like to stay current
with up-and-coming young editors.

28:21.266 --> 28:23.826
Brunch sometime?
Have your assistant set it up.

28:23.868 --> 28:26.837
- Actually, she's not...
- I would be happy to.

28:32.210 --> 28:34.838
- You didn't have to do that.
- I know.

28:36.981 --> 28:39.074
- Thanks.
- I just figured you were due

28:39.117 --> 28:40.982
for a change in luck.

28:46.091 --> 28:47.558
It's you.

28:47.892 --> 28:50.087
Emergency editors' meeting
at 4:00 p. m.

28:50.128 --> 28:53.188
- That's in seven minutes!
- Well, we have to get back to the office!

28:53.231 --> 28:55.529
I'll get the cab.
You go back to Mr. Badlani,

28:55.567 --> 28:57.865
tell him, and get our clothes.

28:59.270 --> 29:01.431
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hold the door!
Thank you!

29:01.473 --> 29:03.304
Come on, hurry! Where's my clothes?

29:03.341 --> 29:05.775
Um, I might have accidentally
trashed them.

29:05.810 --> 29:07.072
- What?
- In my defense,

29:07.112 --> 29:09.774
I was sort of hating you at the time.
Here, let me...

29:09.814 --> 29:11.645
- Don't help me!
- Betty, don't be like that.

29:11.683 --> 29:13.150
You know, every single time

29:13.184 --> 29:15.584
I think there's a glimmer of
a decent person in there,

29:15.620 --> 29:17.520
you always seem to prove me wrong.

29:17.555 --> 29:21.150
And now I get to go back to the office
dressed like a hot dog,

29:21.192 --> 29:24.719
where everybody already thinks
I'm a joke. Thank you!

29:32.403 --> 29:34.633
Close the door, please!

29:43.348 --> 29:48.047
Why do we have to accept
that our loved ones are gone?

29:48.086 --> 29:51.487
They're with us always,
and if we deny that,

29:52.090 --> 29:57.392
it'll only prolong our pain.
So I say, reject acceptance.

30:00.665 --> 30:03.498
You don't agree with me?

30:03.535 --> 30:05.526
You don't want to be here, do you?

30:05.570 --> 30:07.936
- No, he doesn't.
- Yes, I do.

30:08.706 --> 30:14.406
I'm offering you a chance at an elevated
relationship with someone you lost,

30:14.979 --> 30:18.073
but you can only achieve
that connection

30:18.116 --> 30:21.950
when you're honest with yourself
about what you want.

30:23.121 --> 30:25.612
And you can't even be honest with me.

30:25.657 --> 30:28.956
Or can you? Do you want to be here?

30:29.227 --> 30:30.990
Fine. I don't want to be here.

30:31.029 --> 30:36.126
Congratulations.
You just healed a part of yourself.

30:39.137 --> 30:42.504
- You're scoffing at that?
- I wasn't scoffing.

30:42.540 --> 30:45.270
He was, he was scoffing.
He's been doing it all day.

30:45.343 --> 30:47.811
- Stop it.
- What? I'm trying to help you.

30:47.846 --> 30:51.839
Fine. Yes, I was scoffing, but come on.

30:51.883 --> 30:56.081
"Honesty heals"? Don't you think
that sounds a little simplistic?

30:57.222 --> 31:03.525
Well, people have always
underestimated the power of simplicity.

31:04.229 --> 31:10.134
Tell you what, go and try
being honest in your daily life,

31:10.168 --> 31:12.295
exactly when you think
you shouldn't be.

31:12.337 --> 31:17.536
And if I'm right and it frees you up
in some way, come back.

31:18.042 --> 31:20.010
And if it doesn't, fine.

31:20.044 --> 31:25.311
Accept that the person you love
is gone forever and good luck with that.

31:33.725 --> 31:35.750
Amanda, can we talk?

31:36.394 --> 31:39.727
I need to tell you something
and it's kind of a secret.

31:39.764 --> 31:41.823
- What is it?
- Come here.

31:42.834 --> 31:44.324
No, closer.

31:48.072 --> 31:49.471
Closer.

31:59.083 --> 32:02.450
Mmm. Amanda, you're such
a good kisser!

32:07.091 --> 32:08.490
It's just a hot dog suit.

32:08.526 --> 32:11.222
Look, do you know
if the editors' meeting started yet?

32:11.262 --> 32:12.627
Amanda?

32:14.399 --> 32:16.765
Have you seen... Have you seen Betty?

32:16.801 --> 32:22.467
Betty? Listen, Wilhelmina is cutting
10 pages of content for budget.

32:22.507 --> 32:24.065
Everyone is fighting
to keep their stuff in.

32:24.108 --> 32:27.339
I look ridiculous!
Do I have time to change?

32:27.378 --> 32:31.405
If you want to save your article,
we'd better get in there quick.

32:32.550 --> 32:36.281
Lexie, can you get the Book
from the art department, please?

32:38.156 --> 32:41.148
Get it yourself.
You know how to grab things.

32:43.294 --> 32:45.353
Wait, Lexie. Lexie, hey.

32:47.465 --> 32:49.023
Let me be totally honest with you.

32:49.067 --> 32:52.525
The only reason I hired you
is because you're hot.

32:52.570 --> 32:54.936
In fact, you're crazy hot.

32:54.973 --> 32:58.739
And I'm a man who likes to look
at a beautiful woman. So, sue me.

32:58.776 --> 33:01.745
No, no, he's just kidding.

33:01.779 --> 33:05.215
No, no, no, don't, don't sue him.
Daniel, what are you doing?

33:05.249 --> 33:08.980
I'm telling the truth.
You're not right for this job, Lexie.

33:09.020 --> 33:10.749
You're mean, you're impatient,

33:10.788 --> 33:12.653
you walk around
as if everyone's below you,

33:12.690 --> 33:15.386
and they are
because you're 20 feet tall.

33:15.426 --> 33:21.524
You're not an assistant, Lexie.
I think you would make a terrific model.

33:22.533 --> 33:24.160
- A model?
- Yeah, think about it.

33:24.202 --> 33:26.102
You shouldn't be behind a desk.

33:26.137 --> 33:28.970
You should be sprawled across a desk,

33:29.007 --> 33:34.035
dressed in skin-tight couture, looking
hungry on the cover of a magazine!

33:34.078 --> 33:35.511
Oh, God.

33:36.280 --> 33:40.148
You know, I always thought
I was too pretty to be a secretary,

33:40.184 --> 33:43.278
but girls always hated me
when I said it out loud.

33:43.321 --> 33:46.484
Okay, well say it, then.
Say, "I am a model. "

33:46.624 --> 33:50.253
I am a model!

33:51.896 --> 33:54.763
Thank you! I have to go
tell everyone that I know now.

33:59.303 --> 34:00.497
Wow.

34:02.673 --> 34:04.664
What the hell was that?

34:05.877 --> 34:07.310
Honesty.

34:10.313 --> 34:13.715
I'm sorry, Jill. You can't convince me
that leggings are pants.

34:13.751 --> 34:16.719
Your article's out. Who's next?

34:18.222 --> 34:19.985
Whatever that is, it's cut.

34:20.024 --> 34:22.185
Wait, wait, doesn't Betty get a chance
to defend her article?

34:22.226 --> 34:25.422
- Everybody else did.
- All right. You have 30 seconds, go.

34:26.030 --> 34:28.862
Okay, my article is about
the toughest jobs in New York.

34:28.900 --> 34:31.027
Seems a little dry.

34:31.268 --> 34:33.567
Maybe it could use some mustard.

34:35.973 --> 34:38.998
<i>I'm sorry, Betty,
I don't see it fitting in Mode.</i>

34:39.043 --> 34:41.170
Maybe I had to be there.

34:41.612 --> 34:46.481
Wait, Willie! But you could be
if we recreated it for you!

34:46.617 --> 34:50.610
- What are you doing?
- I'm saving you. Come on, dance!

35:15.580 --> 35:18.879
That was the most humiliating thing
I've ever seen.

35:18.916 --> 35:22.443
Yes, these uniforms are ridiculous,

35:22.487 --> 35:26.389
but this whole city is full of uniforms.

35:26.424 --> 35:30.155
And inspiration for fashion
comes from the most unlikely places.

35:30.194 --> 35:32.458
Like bike messengers in bright Lycra.

35:32.497 --> 35:35.261
Or the epaulets
on a policeman's uniform.

35:35.299 --> 35:37.927
Trash collectors
were wearing jumpsuits

35:37.969 --> 35:41.700
way before they showed up
on every runway last spring.

35:42.173 --> 35:46.200
Also, look at these funny pictures
of Betty wearing the uniforms.

35:49.247 --> 35:51.147
I can't run those pictures.

35:51.182 --> 35:54.174
Then instead of Betty,
picture a supermodel.

35:57.855 --> 36:01.951
Hmm. Congratulations, Betty. You're in.

36:12.103 --> 36:15.004
Wow. I mean, look how good
these came out.

36:15.673 --> 36:18.267
Oh! Here's Lexie pulling the pedicab.

36:18.309 --> 36:21.369
Yep, the camera loves
"Lexie, like sexy. "

36:22.213 --> 36:26.081
I have no idea what I was thinking
hiring her as my assistant.

36:26.384 --> 36:28.875
I mean, come on, that was something
old Daniel would do.

36:28.920 --> 36:31.787
Come on, you made a mistake.
You're only human.

36:31.822 --> 36:35.656
So, why is it you'll cut me some slack,
but you won't do the same for yourself?

36:35.693 --> 36:36.853
What do you mean?

36:36.894 --> 36:39.624
I mean, this is your first piece
for the magazine as editor,

36:39.664 --> 36:41.063
and it's a great spread.

36:41.098 --> 36:44.431
- You're not even the least bit excited.
- I'm excited!

36:44.468 --> 36:45.662
But?

36:48.639 --> 36:51.233
It's just, I've been
fighting and fighting with Marc,

36:51.275 --> 36:53.573
trying to prove to him
that I deserve to be the editor.

36:53.611 --> 36:55.806
And then he's the one
who saved the day.

36:55.846 --> 36:57.814
Betty, this whole piece was your idea.

36:57.848 --> 37:01.443
Why don't you know you're good
at this? You're great at this.

37:01.485 --> 37:04.249
I don't know,
maybe because I was tails.

37:07.124 --> 37:12.221
Look, Betty, some people get the job
because of the flip of a coin, all right?

37:12.263 --> 37:16.495
Some people get the job because
their father owns the company.

37:17.368 --> 37:21.429
It doesn't matter how you get it.
It matters what you do with it.

37:29.647 --> 37:33.105
Hilda, can I borrow you?
This will only take a minute.

37:34.752 --> 37:36.583
I'll be right back.

37:36.621 --> 37:38.646
<i>And now
to candidate Archie Rodriguez.</i>

37:38.723 --> 37:42.181
<i>Now, a lot of hubbub has been made
over a certain photo of my girlfriend.</i>

37:42.226 --> 37:45.787
<i>And I just wish the press
would stop showing this photo.</i>

37:46.530 --> 37:48.691
- That's not my best angle.
- Just watch.

37:48.733 --> 37:51.497
<i>Everyone's been asking me
if I want to apologize to the voters.</i>

37:51.535 --> 37:56.370
<i>But the truth is, the only person who
deserves an apology is my girlfriend.</i>

37:56.407 --> 38:01.674
<i>She had her privacy invaded, and
I'm sorry I wasn't more understanding.</i>

38:02.046 --> 38:04.606
<i>As for the voters, they're just gonna
have to accept the fact</i>

38:04.649 --> 38:07.846
<i>that my girlfriend is sexy.</i>

38:08.986 --> 38:11.477
<i>And I will not apologize for that.</i>

38:12.823 --> 38:15.758
Archie! I can't believe you did that!

38:15.793 --> 38:20.230
Yeah, and we got the latest polls.
And thanks to your sexy picture, Hilda,

38:20.264 --> 38:22.858
I'm more popular than ever.
I'm in the lead!

38:22.900 --> 38:25.391
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God, that's fantastic!

38:25.436 --> 38:27.904
Oh, my God, Archie, you're gonna win!

38:33.844 --> 38:36.574
Wait, now? I have customers.

38:38.282 --> 38:39.806
They can wait.

38:42.486 --> 38:46.320
Mrs. Ramirez,
I'll be back in 11 minutes!

38:50.227 --> 38:54.357
I brought us a treat. Frozen yogurt!

38:54.398 --> 38:56.628
Chocolate! My favorite!

38:56.901 --> 38:58.459
Mine, too.

38:58.803 --> 39:01.101
Mmm.

39:04.575 --> 39:07.373
Frozen yogurt in the middle of the day?
What's the occasion?

39:07.411 --> 39:10.244
Momma is keeping her job.

39:11.048 --> 39:15.075
Isabelle Besset turned it down.
And for the life of me, I don't know why.

39:15.119 --> 39:18.247
<i>You would think that Mode
would be a step up from French Elle.</i>

39:18.322 --> 39:21.189
<i>Well, I heard she got a call
from an editor at French Mode.</i>

39:21.225 --> 39:25.127
Something about how difficult
Claire and Hartley are to work for.

39:25.162 --> 39:26.356
Hmm.

39:26.397 --> 39:29.764
<i>I don't remember bribing
anyone from Mode France.</i>

39:35.806 --> 39:37.034
You?

39:37.808 --> 39:40.038
You devious little minx!

39:40.077 --> 39:43.945
I guess all those years
at French boarding school paid off.

39:43.981 --> 39:47.439
Mom, I'm just so sorry
about dragging you into all this.

39:47.485 --> 39:51.649
And I figured after all
you've done for me, I owe it to you.

39:51.989 --> 39:57.222
Oh, Nico, my darling daughter,
I would do anything for you.

39:57.361 --> 40:02.321
And I have a feeling
everything is gonna be all right.

40:19.316 --> 40:22.410
Oh! I thought you swore
you'd never get me coffee.

40:22.453 --> 40:24.887
Don't get too excited,
I put it on your card.

40:24.922 --> 40:28.949
Oh! I want to show you
the final edit of the article.

40:28.993 --> 40:30.961
You know, Betty,
you're a great writer and all,

40:30.995 --> 40:32.587
but I'm not exactly
in a reading mood right now.

40:32.630 --> 40:35.997
- Can you just give me the summary?
- Can you just read the top?

40:43.741 --> 40:45.971
You're sharing your byline with me?

40:47.611 --> 40:50.774
<i>In five years at Mode,
I've never had a byline.</i>

40:52.116 --> 40:54.311
Why are you so nice to me?

40:55.786 --> 40:59.051
Either one of us
could have gotten this promotion.

41:00.991 --> 41:04.586
And right before Daniel told me,
he had this look on his face,

41:04.628 --> 41:08.530
and I thought,
"That's it, they're giving it to Marc. "

41:08.566 --> 41:12.263
I was sure of it. I mean, I say
I would have been happy for you,

41:12.303 --> 41:14.897
but I don't know.

41:15.706 --> 41:17.697
You would've been happy.

41:24.949 --> 41:26.974
- Were you just about to hug me?
- Shut up, no.

41:27.017 --> 41:29.417
- You were about to hug me!
- Okay.

41:31.322 --> 41:34.655
Listen, can we talk about this byline?
Shouldn't my name come first?

41:34.692 --> 41:36.387
Don't push it.

41:37.305 --> 41:43.396
