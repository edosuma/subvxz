12:02.545 --> 12:04.448
There is no discord here.

12:05.550 --> 12:08.654
Right.
What's your name, then?

12:09.653 --> 12:10.721
Stella.

12:11.421 --> 12:14.191
That's got to be the prettiest
name I have ever heard.

12:15.059 --> 12:16.759
It's like a star, isn't it?

12:16.761 --> 12:22.435
No. Stellas have been stars,
but not all stars are Stellas.

12:23.534 --> 12:27.139
Well, you look
like a star, Stella.

12:38.451 --> 12:40.486

12:58.239 --> 13:00.039
They must be from California.

They fuck anything that moves
in California.

is the sister city to Fresno.

13:14.489 --> 13:16.589
It's going to be
all right, mate.

13:16.591 --> 13:18.660
Just corner the one
that looks the loneliest

13:18.662 --> 13:22.066

in short admiring sentences.

13:25.802 --> 13:27.605

to that.

It's long for Wain.

15:26.799 --> 15:28.599
I don't remember you.

15:28.601 --> 15:30.503
Don't you find it sad
that we never seem

15:30.505 --> 15:33.408
to recognize each other
on birthdays?

15:34.608 --> 15:36.477
Weren't you a virus last time?

15:37.278 --> 15:39.281
- Last time?
- I thought so.

15:40.380 --> 15:41.483
I'm a Second.

But that is no reflection
on Parent-Teacher Wain.

16:03.406 --> 16:05.310
That is my own burden.

16:05.710 --> 16:07.811
My mate John has got
a third nipple,

16:08.712 --> 16:11.715
and it never held him back
in any way.

16:12.816 --> 16:17.523
In our culture, he would class
as an abomination.

After all,

The iconic London sights,
Big Ben, Westminster Abbey,

17:14.083 --> 17:16.516
This whole
Queen's jubilee celebration

17:16.518 --> 17:18.385
sort of blindsided us
Parent-Teachers

17:18.387 --> 17:20.625
and the city is booked solid.

17:20.856 --> 17:22.824
But we've managed
to patch together

17:22.826 --> 17:24.358
a brand-new itinerary

17:24.359 --> 17:26.396
of equally
nourishing experiences,

17:26.596 --> 17:28.462
all within
this deeply authentic

17:28.464 --> 17:30.269

17:31.501 --> 17:32.803
Croydon.

17:33.370 --> 17:35.704
Zan, what are you
looking forward

17:35.706 --> 17:37.876
to experiencing in Croydon?

17:40.811 --> 17:45.951
I've sensed some tension
over our last few stops, Zan.

17:46.617 --> 17:48.954
Do you have something
you want to interjaculate?

17:50.755 --> 17:52.489

"enrichment"

but we're behaving more like
tourists than travelers.

18:15.448 --> 18:18.685
I mean, perhaps we could
emulate the Stellas

18:18.687 --> 18:20.689
and really participate.

18:20.956 --> 18:23.656
The Stellas have
a different way

18:23.658 --> 18:25.859
of enriching their community.

18:25.861 --> 18:28.965
Well, all we ever seem to do
is observe and consume.

Or the Sex Pistols?

19:13.011 --> 19:14.611

19:14.613 --> 19:15.978
Well, some people
don't count the Dolls.

19:15.980 --> 19:17.818

at the Roxy.

all these arseholes,

spreads himself everywhere

and conformity.

30:34.482 --> 30:36.382

is forced insemination

we'll stop doing

that in every person's DNA
