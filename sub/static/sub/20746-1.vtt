02:51.089 --> 02:53.550
Uther, I don't think we can win this fight.

02:53.716 --> 02:55.885
I know Mordred. He would accept surrender.

02:56.052 --> 02:57.053
Hold the crown.

02:59.556 --> 03:00.557
And hold it steady.

03:56.112 --> 03:58.156
Drink their blood!

04:02.660 --> 04:03.661
War!

06:06.617 --> 06:09.287
<i>Let us not forget that before Mordred,</i>

06:09.454 --> 06:12.623
<i>the Mages lived among us in harmony.</i>

06:12.790 --> 06:16.002
Our relationship with them
was always peaceful.

06:16.169 --> 06:19.839
That was before they tasted power,
and produced those creatures of war.

06:20.006 --> 06:22.800
<i>But it was only Mordred, not his people.</i>

06:22.967 --> 06:25.178
<i>So why are we slaughtering them, Vortigern?</i>

06:25.344 --> 06:27.472
Was not the Prince friendly
with the Mages at one time?

06:27.638 --> 06:29.265
Did he not study with Mordred himself?

06:29.432 --> 06:30.725
What are you implying?

06:31.559 --> 06:35.772
I was sent to study with him by my father
as a token of diplomacy.

06:35.938 --> 06:38.691
<i>We would only seek to remind Your Majesty</i>

06:38.858 --> 06:42.070
that it was a Mage, Merlin,
who gave you the great sword.

06:42.570 --> 06:43.571
Light!

06:43.821 --> 06:46.741
<i>Where would we be without Merlin
and the Mages who helped him?</i>

06:47.325 --> 06:49.994
Where are they now?
Why do they not show themselves?

06:50.161 --> 06:52.288
You know where they are, Lord Mercia.

06:52.455 --> 06:54.499
- They are running for their lives!
- Enough!

06:54.665 --> 06:55.666
Loose!

06:55.875 --> 06:58.002
<i>There will be no more killings.</i>

06:58.169 --> 07:01.172
There will be no more purges.
Am I clear, brother?

07:04.884 --> 07:06.135
Now leave me.

07:16.437 --> 07:17.438
Peace?

07:24.987 --> 07:26.364
For a while.

07:28.324 --> 07:30.910
Have we arrived in time
to save you from each other?

07:31.077 --> 07:33.871
The only person I need saving from is you.

07:34.038 --> 07:36.290
I came for the child, not you.

07:36.457 --> 07:38.376
Then you'll have to fight me for him.

07:39.043 --> 07:40.294
My brother's not himself today.

07:40.545 --> 07:41.546
<i>Look after him.</i>

07:41.754 --> 07:43.047
I'll see you tomorrow.

08:10.074 --> 08:11.742
Are the men ready?

08:11.909 --> 08:13.244
Yes, they are.

08:16.122 --> 08:18.249
Are you sure about this, my Lord?

08:25.089 --> 08:28.718
Listen to me, woman.
I need you to do as I tell you.

08:28.885 --> 08:29.927
What's going on?

08:30.094 --> 08:32.263
<i>I need to get you and the boy away from here.</i>

08:32.429 --> 08:34.097
<i>And I'll join you as soon as I can.</i>

08:34.265 --> 08:35.433
<i>I'm scared, Uther.</i>

08:35.600 --> 08:38.269
<i>I have the sword. Hurry.</i>

08:39.895 --> 08:41.981
How do you know of this place, my love?

08:43.399 --> 08:45.401
You must tell me where we're going.

08:47.904 --> 08:48.988
Why do you not answer me?

08:59.916 --> 09:02.043
Tell me what we're doing down here.

09:12.303 --> 09:14.555
My darling, tell me what it is.

09:24.398 --> 09:25.983
Tell me what it is, and I'll make it stop.

09:29.195 --> 09:30.446
It's okay.

10:16.867 --> 10:17.952
Untie the skiff.

12:59.613 --> 13:01.198
King Vortigern!

13:04.118 --> 13:05.286
Move!

13:08.164 --> 13:09.331
Hey!

13:31.228 --> 13:32.938
Come here!

14:07.765 --> 14:09.266
Come on! Come on!

14:44.802 --> 14:46.971
<i>Run, son!</i>

15:56.247 --> 15:58.375
Step aside for the king.

16:25.611 --> 16:26.654
Get them back to work.

16:26.820 --> 16:27.821
Sire.

16:29.323 --> 16:32.785
Sergeant! Get them under manners!

17:20.624 --> 17:23.292
Still so handsome, my king.

17:23.752 --> 17:25.462
Why has the water dropped?

17:26.296 --> 17:28.632
Why does the sword reveal itself now?

17:29.133 --> 17:32.302
<i>I'm not ready, the tower is not complete.</i>

17:33.220 --> 17:37.683
As your power increases, so, too,
do the forces that will oppose you.

17:37.933 --> 17:42.020
Balance is a law that cannot be transgressed.

17:42.438 --> 17:45.149
The born king will come.

17:45.315 --> 17:47.985
It is inevitable.

17:49.611 --> 17:50.738
We had a deal.

17:50.904 --> 17:56.326
When the blood of a loved one is spilt
in these waters, my desire must be met.

17:56.493 --> 17:59.163
<i>There is no ambiguity, my Lord.</i>

17:59.538 --> 18:01.582
We kept our side of the covenant.

18:01.749 --> 18:04.877
It was you who lost the boy, and the sword.

18:05.043 --> 18:06.503
Have I not sacrificed enough?

18:07.004 --> 18:09.006
And have you not felt your power increase?

18:09.465 --> 18:12.593
With every kingdom conquered,
with every level added to your tower.

18:12.760 --> 18:17.973
When it is capped with the silver from Gaul,
you will have what you wanted.

18:20.434 --> 18:22.186
<i>Find the boy.</i>

18:22.352 --> 18:23.353
<i>Kill him.</i>

18:23.854 --> 18:26.607
<i>And the sword will answer only to you.</i>

18:27.357 --> 18:29.985
If you desire further help,

18:30.277 --> 18:32.362
you know the price.

18:38.076 --> 18:39.953
Bumped into the Vikings this morning.

18:40.454 --> 18:42.623
They insisted I give you this

18:43.749 --> 18:46.251
with their deepest apologies.

18:50.214 --> 18:51.548
Get yourself well.

18:51.715 --> 18:53.175
This wasn't your responsibility, Arthur.

18:53.342 --> 18:54.551
Don't be silly.

18:54.718 --> 18:58.055
You girls have looked after me for
a lot longer than I've looked after you.

18:58.555 --> 18:59.848
I owe you everything.

19:02.309 --> 19:03.435
What's so funny?

19:03.602 --> 19:06.063
I just wanna know
how you get money out of Vikings.

19:07.856 --> 19:09.358
You ask them for it.

19:11.193 --> 19:13.028
- <i>Open the door!</i>
- <i>Hey.</i>

19:14.196 --> 19:15.447
<i>Open in the name of the king!</i>

19:15.697 --> 19:16.698
Open it.

19:18.867 --> 19:19.868
Yes, gentlemen?

19:20.035 --> 19:22.913
A turner come down this way.
We're searching all houses.

19:23.080 --> 19:25.499
Whoa. Slow down, new boy, before you trip up.

19:25.666 --> 19:26.834
What did you say?

19:27.960 --> 19:29.419
I'm gonna take your hands for that.

19:29.586 --> 19:31.004
Sergeant!

19:33.006 --> 19:35.342
What did I tell you about this establishment?

19:35.676 --> 19:36.802
He touched me, sir.

19:36.969 --> 19:38.929
Well, you should count yourself lucky.

19:39.096 --> 19:41.223
Most people have to pay for that.

19:41.390 --> 19:44.309
Now take your terriers and get out!

19:48.689 --> 19:49.815
Jack's Eye.

19:50.524 --> 19:52.109
What did he want in here?

19:52.818 --> 19:55.279
Resistance are on the move again.

19:55.445 --> 19:57.531
Hit a branding barge upriver.

19:59.157 --> 20:01.159
Anyone in the house you don't know?

20:02.536 --> 20:05.372
Well, I'm not sure, Jack. People come and go.

20:05.747 --> 20:07.624
But we don't fall that side.

20:07.791 --> 20:09.543
Ah, well, that's as may be.

20:11.628 --> 20:13.130
Well, they fall where they fall.

20:13.422 --> 20:16.341
This "born king" bollocks isn't good
for anyone.

20:16.675 --> 20:17.885
Mind if I take a look?

20:20.554 --> 20:21.638
He's bleeding.

20:23.599 --> 20:24.892
Took an arrow on the way out.

20:26.476 --> 20:29.897
What would happen to a man
who hits the king's barge upriver?

20:30.188 --> 20:31.523
<i>Well, you know what would happen.</i>

20:34.234 --> 20:35.819
And it doesn't happen quickly.

20:36.361 --> 20:38.572
What would happen to the people
harboring such a man?

20:38.739 --> 20:41.199
Well, they get treated the same
as the man they hide.

20:41.366 --> 20:42.826
Would they, now?

20:45.704 --> 20:47.915
Not sure you're too welcome here, mate.

20:59.509 --> 21:01.511
You're in safe hands now, no need to worry.

21:03.180 --> 21:05.182
In the back room, now.

21:05.807 --> 21:08.101
What's this all about, Jack?
What's it got to do with us?

21:08.268 --> 21:10.437
Do you have any idea who that man is?

21:10.604 --> 21:12.856
For a man who's so popular,
I'm surprised I don't.

21:13.023 --> 21:14.358
Goosefat Bill.

21:14.524 --> 21:16.234
I know who he is. He got that moniker

21:16.401 --> 21:19.029
'cause he keeps slipping out
from the bars you keep putting him behind.

21:19.196 --> 21:21.573
He was found in this establishment,
and that doesn't look good for you.

21:21.740 --> 21:22.783
What's going on?

21:23.033 --> 21:24.368
What's going on where?

21:24.534 --> 21:27.079
You've got some heat on you, Arthur.
Your name keeps coming up.

21:27.245 --> 21:28.372
In what circles?

21:28.538 --> 21:30.248
My mum's sewing circle.

21:30.415 --> 21:33.877
I'm a Blackleg sergeant, stupid.
What circles do you think?

21:35.045 --> 21:37.381
Now, tell me a story
about a girl called Lucy,

21:37.547 --> 21:38.882
<i>a Viking called Greybeard,</i>

21:39.049 --> 21:41.468
<i>and some rebel graffiti dirtying these walls.</i>

21:41.635 --> 21:42.928
Are you writing a book?

21:43.136 --> 21:44.596
Tell me. Every detail.

21:46.640 --> 21:48.976
We had a quiet word with a couple of Vikings.

21:49.142 --> 21:51.395
Get back! Back!

21:52.729 --> 21:54.940
I said from the beginning,
the very beginning.

21:55.107 --> 21:56.149
I woke up.

21:56.733 --> 21:58.068
Then?

21:58.610 --> 21:59.611
Well, then I got dressed.

21:59.778 --> 22:01.822
<i>I went downstairs, I saw the girls.
Lucy was missing.</i>

22:01.989 --> 22:03.073
Where's Lucy?

22:03.323 --> 22:05.033
- She's a good girl.
- A nice girl.

22:05.200 --> 22:06.410
- She works here.
- Then?

22:06.660 --> 22:08.453
<i>Then me and the lads</i>

22:08.662 --> 22:09.997
<i>took care of a bit of business.</i>

22:10.163 --> 22:11.164
<i>Bit of housekeeping.</i>

22:11.331 --> 22:12.332
Everything as it should be?

22:12.624 --> 22:14.001
That's the spoil from the boats.

22:14.167 --> 22:15.168
- Then?
- Then we heard...

22:15.335 --> 22:17.004
George had trouble again last night.

22:17.254 --> 22:18.547
All right, meet me out the front.

22:19.006 --> 22:20.465
Which George? King George? Angry George?

22:20.632 --> 22:22.175
George of the Dragon? Be clear, Arthur.

22:22.342 --> 22:23.844
- Which George?
- Our George.

22:24.011 --> 22:25.971
<i>Chinese George, Kung-Fu George.</i>

22:26.138 --> 22:28.015
- George?
- Art.

22:28.181 --> 22:30.183
- <i>We heard he'd had some trouble with the...</i>
- Vikings.

22:30.350 --> 22:31.727
Well, none of them are house-trained.

22:31.893 --> 22:33.520
- I thought you'd warned them.
- I did.

22:33.687 --> 22:35.063
They don't speak English good.

22:35.230 --> 22:36.356
They speak it better than you.

22:36.523 --> 22:37.774
<i>Hold up, hold up. Back up.</i>

22:37.941 --> 22:40.485
Are you sure you didn't see someone else
before you saw George?

22:41.820 --> 22:42.821
Morning, Art.

22:43.071 --> 22:44.614
We saw Mike.

22:44.781 --> 22:45.782
All right, Mike.

22:45.949 --> 22:47.367
Mike the Spike? Kosher Mike? Which Mike?

22:47.534 --> 22:48.785
You're giving me a headache.

22:48.952 --> 22:49.953
Flat-Nose Mike.

22:50.120 --> 22:53.123
<i>He was trafficking furs through
our vicinity without paying a commission.</i>

22:53.290 --> 22:55.333
That's quite a load, bit bigger than usual.

22:55.500 --> 22:57.044
Yeah, changed last minute. Just landed on me.

22:57.210 --> 22:58.503
More is better than less.

22:58.670 --> 22:59.963
More is always better than less, Mike.

23:00.464 --> 23:02.841
More's definitely better than less, Mike.
You've had a result.

23:03.925 --> 23:06.970
I'm sorry, Art. It won't happen again.
I promise.

23:07.929 --> 23:08.972
You're all right, Mike.

23:09.139 --> 23:10.974
Why have enemies when you can have friends?

23:11.141 --> 23:12.350
- Where'd you put the money?
- What money?

23:12.517 --> 23:13.643
- Money?
- What money?

23:13.810 --> 23:15.145
Did you hide it
with the rest of your coffers?

23:15.312 --> 23:18.315
You're all over the place. You can't keep
your questions in a straight line.

23:18.482 --> 23:20.984
<i>I'm trying to tell a story here
and you keep interrupting.</i>

23:21.151 --> 23:22.819
<i>Anyway, I don't have any coffers.</i>

23:22.986 --> 23:26.823
Once you've taken your share, and I've looked
after the weak and needy, I'm left broke.

23:26.990 --> 23:28.075
Mike and the furs.

23:28.241 --> 23:29.951
So we're back to that story,
are we now, Jack?

23:30.118 --> 23:31.536
- What are you doing, Mike?
- Sharing the wealth.

23:31.953 --> 23:33.705
Don't pass it to me, Mike.
It doesn't work like that.

23:33.872 --> 23:34.873
Give it to Wet Stick.

23:35.290 --> 23:37.125
I'm Back Lack.
What are you giving it to me for?

23:37.292 --> 23:38.335
What was I thinking?

23:38.502 --> 23:40.253
Don't upset the boss, Mike.
He doesn't handle the money.

23:40.420 --> 23:41.797
Sorry, it's been a long day.

23:41.963 --> 23:43.507
It's first thing in the morning, Mike.

23:43.673 --> 23:45.383
- Did he pay?
- <i>'Course he paid.</i>

23:45.550 --> 23:46.635
He's a good boy, that Mike.

23:46.802 --> 23:48.804
Buy some lessons in street etiquette
with the change.

23:48.970 --> 23:50.680
- Change?
- There's no change, Mike.

23:50.847 --> 23:52.557
- See you later, Mike.
- Cheers, Mike!

23:53.934 --> 23:55.227
What is this about, Jack?

23:55.519 --> 23:57.979
Rebel graffiti. A young boy.

23:58.230 --> 24:00.023
Your boy. Blue Boy.

24:00.190 --> 24:01.399
And he's a good boy.

24:01.566 --> 24:03.193
Oi! What are you lot doing?

24:03.360 --> 24:05.195
Don't start getting the wrong end
of the stick, Jack.

24:05.695 --> 24:07.030
<i>He's an upstanding citizen.</i>

24:07.197 --> 24:08.782
I think I found something
that belongs to you, Lack.

24:08.949 --> 24:10.200
What you doing, boy?

24:10.367 --> 24:11.368
He's coming back.

24:11.535 --> 24:12.536
Who's coming back?

24:12.911 --> 24:14.037
The born king.

24:14.204 --> 24:16.206
Yeah, and when he does,
he'll spank your arse.

24:16.373 --> 24:18.708
Now, let's get your hands clean
while you still got some.

24:18.875 --> 24:20.418
He'll cut 'em off and have you in chains.

24:20.585 --> 24:22.212
If we can catch you, they can catch you.

24:22.629 --> 24:24.005
If you can catch him, so can we.

24:24.172 --> 24:25.590
Should we go back to George,
and the trouble with the...

24:25.757 --> 24:27.134
- Vikings.
- So what happened?

24:27.300 --> 24:30.679
Started throwing their weight about,
and then Lucy got the worst of it.

24:30.846 --> 24:32.180
- Come again, George?
- They hurt Lucy.

24:32.347 --> 24:33.598
- My Lucy?
- <i>That can't happen, Jack.</i>

24:33.932 --> 24:35.225
That can never happen, Jack.

24:35.392 --> 24:36.476
You see, she's a friend of mine.

24:36.643 --> 24:38.061
So you're gonna have to sort her out.

24:38.228 --> 24:40.272
They'd been warned. They had to pay.

24:40.438 --> 24:42.149
How'd you get money from a Viking?

24:42.649 --> 24:44.317
I feel a joke coming on here.

24:44.484 --> 24:45.652
You ask him for it.

24:45.819 --> 24:48.822
You're paying and then you're leaving.

24:49.406 --> 24:50.740
Nobody's talking to you, sweetheart.

24:50.907 --> 24:52.409
You sit there and be quiet.
You are better at that...

24:52.576 --> 24:54.411
Or I'll have to put an arrow
through your lard-loving thigh.

24:56.580 --> 24:59.082
You were unarmed. You just walked
in there and asked them for it?

24:59.249 --> 25:00.917
That's right, Jack, and they gave it to me.

25:01.084 --> 25:03.253
<i>They were trying on furs.
The same furs, as it happens,</i>

25:03.420 --> 25:05.255
<i>that Flat-Nose Mike tried to hide from us.</i>

25:05.839 --> 25:07.257
More is always better than less, Mike.

25:07.424 --> 25:08.925
Old Greybeard banged on for a bit.

25:09.092 --> 25:11.261
I got 50 seasoned men of war.

25:11.428 --> 25:14.139
You could shave a pig on the edge
of our blades.

25:14.306 --> 25:16.766
If you were unarmed, where'd you find
the blade to put to his throat?

25:16.933 --> 25:18.810
Well, I borrowed it from his big, silly mate

25:18.977 --> 25:21.271
<i>after Back Lack put an arrow
through his lard-loving thigh.</i>

25:25.609 --> 25:26.610
Get back!

25:27.110 --> 25:28.486
That's your story, Jack.

25:28.653 --> 25:29.696
I am leaving.

25:29.863 --> 25:31.823
But I'm leaving with a year's wages.

25:31.990 --> 25:33.867
Old Greybeard surrendered his dignity.

25:35.243 --> 25:37.370
<i>Lucy got a year's worth of wages.</i>

25:37.537 --> 25:39.623
And the rebel graffiti exists no more

25:39.789 --> 25:43.126
because of the law-abiding,
proactive Blue Boy and his fun-loving dad.

25:43.293 --> 25:46.296
And then, they all lived happily ever after.

25:46.796 --> 25:48.173
No, they didn't, Arthur.

25:50.050 --> 25:52.802
Because for the first time,
there's something you don't know.

25:53.053 --> 25:54.596
Something nobody told you.

25:55.013 --> 25:56.056
And that is?

25:57.140 --> 25:59.184
They're under the protection of the king.

26:02.187 --> 26:06.233
And once you're under the protection
of the king, I can't help you.

26:06.399 --> 26:07.484
Nobody can.

26:09.653 --> 26:11.321
They're not gonna bother about me.

26:15.075 --> 26:16.660
<i>Where do we stand, Mercia?</i>

26:16.826 --> 26:21.957
We're down to the last men of the right age,
and still no one has pulled the sword.

26:22.123 --> 26:24.793
Now put the bird back in the aviary, Catia.

26:30.507 --> 26:33.343
There's a general restlessness
among the people.

26:34.010 --> 26:36.680
More incidents. More graffiti.

26:39.724 --> 26:41.142
I beg your pardon, Your Majesty.

26:41.309 --> 26:42.727
- <i>If I'd known...</i>
- Come here.

26:43.270 --> 26:44.271
<i>I want your opinion.</i>

26:45.689 --> 26:47.565
Maggie represents the people.

26:47.732 --> 26:49.734
She's from one of the oldest families
in England.

26:50.360 --> 26:51.361
She can tell us.

26:51.528 --> 26:52.529
Sire.

26:53.655 --> 26:55.031
Do the people love me?

26:58.118 --> 27:04.040
I love Your Majesty, and if I represent
the people, then you have your answer.

27:04.958 --> 27:06.293
Bring us something to eat.

27:12.590 --> 27:16.094
Even I am left to wonder
if we are pushing them too far.

27:19.806 --> 27:21.308
Finish the tower.

27:22.600 --> 27:24.602
Everything else will be academic.

27:29.733 --> 27:30.859
Thank you, Maggie.

27:49.210 --> 27:50.211
<i>Wake up!</i>

27:50.837 --> 27:52.130
<i>You must control it.</i>

27:54.674 --> 27:56.343
Wake up! Listen!

27:56.509 --> 27:58.428
You need to get out of here, now!

27:58.595 --> 27:59.596
What are you doing, Lack?

27:59.763 --> 28:02.349
Jack's Eye was telling the truth.
Those red beards are connected.

28:02.515 --> 28:03.767
So, what? So are we.

28:03.933 --> 28:04.976
No, you don't understand.

28:05.435 --> 28:06.770
The Blacklegs are coming.

28:07.020 --> 28:10.106
And when they get here,
they're gonna make an example out of you.

28:10.273 --> 28:11.441
You gotta go now.

28:11.608 --> 28:13.360
And you can't use the front door.
Get out the window.

28:13.735 --> 28:15.278
They're here, move!

28:15.945 --> 28:17.614
Open the door!

28:17.781 --> 28:19.949
Oi, you two, in the back!

28:20.116 --> 28:21.785
<i>Kick the door down!</i>

28:22.702 --> 28:24.579
Hey!

28:29.376 --> 28:30.794
- Are you ready?
- Yeah, of course.

28:30.960 --> 28:32.420
Here we go.

28:32.587 --> 28:33.588
All right, fellas?

28:33.755 --> 28:35.799
Hello, boy.
What are you doing out at this time?

28:36.633 --> 28:39.135
I work on the boats, sir.
Out on the first tide.

28:39.302 --> 28:41.429
The boats, eh? What's in the bag?

28:42.514 --> 28:43.807
And you're about the right age.

28:44.682 --> 28:45.767
Show us your brand.

28:50.313 --> 28:51.481
Have you not been tested?

28:51.648 --> 28:53.441
I'm always at sea, sir.
Haven't had the chance.

28:54.401 --> 28:56.027
Well, that's about to change now.

28:56.486 --> 28:59.823
<i>You're going on a boat, all right.
Just not the one you think.</i>

29:09.249 --> 29:11.084
- <i>Come on then, get off!</i>
- <i>Single file!</i>

29:11.251 --> 29:13.169
<i>Come on, get 'em off.</i>

29:13.336 --> 29:16.714
Get your brand, get your drink,
then back on the barge!

29:16.881 --> 29:18.174
Move!

29:18.341 --> 29:21.344
Move it! Come on! Move!

29:21.511 --> 29:22.512
Keep coming!

29:24.514 --> 29:25.849
<i>Move it!</i>

29:26.015 --> 29:27.767
What's all that about?

29:28.184 --> 29:29.894
Guess that's what you get
when you don't pay up.

29:30.353 --> 29:31.521
<i>Taking the kids now.</i>

29:31.688 --> 29:33.731
<i>What's he got them
all penned up out here for?</i>

29:34.524 --> 29:37.444
Well, when you see the king,
why don't you ask him?

29:37.610 --> 29:38.611
Hurry up!

29:40.363 --> 29:41.406
Move along!

29:52.500 --> 29:53.710
What was that?

29:53.877 --> 29:55.044
God save the king.

30:02.719 --> 30:04.554
Bollocks. Excuse me, mate.

30:04.721 --> 30:05.722
Oi.

30:05.889 --> 30:06.890
Leave it.

30:07.891 --> 30:09.601
Excuse me. Behind you, pal.

30:10.393 --> 30:12.228
Here, mind your back.

30:12.395 --> 30:13.980
Oi, pal, there's a line here.

30:15.565 --> 30:16.733
John.

30:19.694 --> 30:20.695
All right, pal.

30:23.490 --> 30:24.782
As you were, mate.

30:27.118 --> 30:28.536
All right, where do you want me?

30:28.953 --> 30:31.080
Trigger, I think we got one here.

30:33.458 --> 30:34.751
<i>Bouncing on my knee.</i>

30:34.918 --> 30:37.420
Where do you think I want you?
Hands on the hilt, stupid.

31:03.238 --> 31:05.240
<i>Oi, both hands.</i>

31:06.866 --> 31:08.743
I said, both hands.

31:12.705 --> 31:14.791
Right, ten digits

31:14.958 --> 31:16.918
round the blunt bit. Give it a tug.

31:17.085 --> 31:18.962
<i>Left foot, right foot.</i>

31:19.254 --> 31:20.463
Collect your brand.

31:20.630 --> 31:21.923
Back on the barge.

32:29.198 --> 32:30.617
<i>That's everything you know about him?</i>

32:30.783 --> 32:32.493
<i>His people were quick to disappear.</i>

32:33.202 --> 32:35.705
We got what information we could.

32:35.872 --> 32:38.708
Got a lot of fingers in a lot of pies.

32:39.375 --> 32:41.210
Blacklegs in his pockets, too.

32:44.547 --> 32:45.965
I'll deal with this.

32:46.132 --> 32:47.342
My king...

32:54.766 --> 32:55.892
Carefully.

33:20.124 --> 33:21.751
So you're Uther's son.

33:22.960 --> 33:26.214
Not only did you survive in the gutter,

33:27.465 --> 33:31.219
you blossomed out of manure.

33:31.386 --> 33:33.137
You've got the wrong man, sire.

33:34.263 --> 33:38.810
I was born in a brothel,
on a bridge in Londinium.

33:38.976 --> 33:42.271
The sword can only be drawn
by Uther Pendragon

33:43.314 --> 33:45.525
or his direct heir.

33:46.317 --> 33:48.986
<i>You felt it, didn't you?</i>

33:49.153 --> 33:50.238
<i>The power.</i>

33:50.655 --> 33:52.365
That's what put you out.

33:53.741 --> 33:55.493
You just don't know how to control it.

33:55.660 --> 33:58.830
I'm nothing but the bastard son
of a prostitute.

33:58.996 --> 34:01.999
You and I have a lot more
in common than you think.

34:02.959 --> 34:08.089
It's not just the same blood we share
but also the same interests.

34:08.255 --> 34:11.092
<i>We both developed a palate for power.</i>

34:11.259 --> 34:13.969
I've never had any power.

34:14.137 --> 34:16.179
Or any desire to achieve it.

34:18.056 --> 34:19.058
<i>Sire,</i>

34:19.516 --> 34:22.437
I could simply drift away,

34:22.728 --> 34:24.480
never to be seen again.

34:24.647 --> 34:28.109
As much as I'd like to believe you,
your character makes that unlikely.

34:29.360 --> 34:32.989
<i>While you were asleep, we've been busy.</i>

34:34.157 --> 34:35.658
<i>I know what kind of a man you are.</i>

34:35.824 --> 34:37.577
<i>I know your story.</i>

34:37.869 --> 34:40.830
<i>And, I've seen your coffers.</i>

34:42.956 --> 34:44.751
Your achievements

34:46.502 --> 34:47.628
now stand

34:49.672 --> 34:51.716
as your prosecution.

34:55.011 --> 34:57.972
What kind of a man would you have become,

34:58.139 --> 35:00.641
had you inherited your father's kingdom

35:00.808 --> 35:03.436
<i>and all its advantages</i>

35:03.603 --> 35:05.897
<i>instead of being raised in a brothel?</i>

35:09.776 --> 35:12.195
What gave you such drive?

35:18.034 --> 35:19.076
Hmm.

35:25.500 --> 35:27.251
So, what happens now?

35:27.835 --> 35:29.670
You know what happens now.

35:31.422 --> 35:33.424
You're quickly becoming a legend.

35:41.390 --> 35:43.392
Someone here to see you.

35:43.643 --> 35:44.811
Mmm-hmm.

35:45.728 --> 35:46.896
I think you need to see her.

36:12.922 --> 36:15.341
Do you know who I am?

36:16.592 --> 36:18.469
I know who you are, Mage.

36:18.845 --> 36:21.264
<i>I've seen you in my dreams.</i>

36:24.100 --> 36:25.685
You've been sent by Merlin.

36:25.852 --> 36:28.020
Then you know why I am here.

36:28.479 --> 36:30.439
So, you will be his guide.

36:31.023 --> 36:32.441
And you will help me.

36:53.963 --> 36:55.047
Bring him here.

36:59.051 --> 37:01.262
There's a crowd of thousands out there.

37:03.639 --> 37:06.142
They've come to see you
more than they've come to see me.

37:22.992 --> 37:24.827
<i>I will show them power.</i>

37:26.245 --> 37:28.623
<i>I will show them strength</i>

37:29.332 --> 37:30.791
<i>and dignity.</i>

37:31.000 --> 37:35.296
<i>You will show them lies, weakness,</i>

37:35.671 --> 37:37.298
<i>and shame.</i>

37:37.465 --> 37:39.008
Hail, King Vortigern!

37:39.425 --> 37:41.636
King Vortigern!

37:42.345 --> 37:45.765
<i>They may have come for you,
but they will leave</i>

37:45.932 --> 37:48.142
<i>and will leave with
a lasting impression of me.</i>

37:49.727 --> 37:51.896
<i>They may even hate me.</i>

37:52.188 --> 37:54.649
<i>I'll let them hate</i>

37:54.815 --> 37:56.734
<i>just so long as they fear.</i>

37:57.068 --> 38:01.030
<i>When people fear you,
I mean, really fear you,</i>

38:01.197 --> 38:04.700
<i>it is the most</i>

38:05.034 --> 38:07.119
<i>intoxicating sensation</i>

38:07.286 --> 38:08.955
a man can possess.

38:10.373 --> 38:15.169
A force of something almost indescribable
moves through your blood

38:15.336 --> 38:16.545
and takes you over completely.

38:18.464 --> 38:23.177
King Vortigern!
King Vortigern! King Vortigern!

38:35.481 --> 38:39.443
I understand that your actions
were very noble,

38:39.610 --> 38:41.320
of defending this whore's honor.

38:42.113 --> 38:46.575
<i>How unfortunate it was at the expense
of my Viking guests.</i>

38:46.909 --> 38:51.372
<i>King Vortigern!
King Vortigern! King Vortigern!</i>

39:04.802 --> 39:07.430
Behold, your born king.

39:10.891 --> 39:13.894
<i>Behold the man who pulled sword from stone.</i>

39:15.563 --> 39:16.897
You wanted a prophecy.

39:19.817 --> 39:21.736
This is your prophecy.

39:22.611 --> 39:23.904
Now tell us, king,

39:24.947 --> 39:26.198
what do you have to say?

39:26.949 --> 39:28.784
<i>When your head rolls to me,</i>

39:28.951 --> 39:31.954
<i>the legend you've fast become
will just as quickly...</i>

39:32.121 --> 39:33.414
Here are your people.

39:33.581 --> 39:35.958
<i>...add to the reverence of my name.</i>

39:37.293 --> 39:38.461
And for this,

39:40.129 --> 39:41.464
I salute you.

39:48.304 --> 39:50.181
No!

39:51.807 --> 39:53.309
- <i>If you're the king...</i>
- No!

39:53.476 --> 39:54.477
...declare yourself.

39:57.813 --> 40:01.317
<i>The rest of them will follow unless
you do what needs to be done.</i>

40:01.817 --> 40:03.069
Do we understand each other?

40:07.823 --> 40:12.161
<i>If you are lost for words,
then let the sword speak for you.</i>

40:13.662 --> 40:14.914
<i>Take it!</i>

40:15.998 --> 40:18.667
And show the people the power of Excalibur.

40:25.758 --> 40:27.551
<i>I said, take it, king.</i>

40:28.594 --> 40:29.845
Raise that sword!

40:35.309 --> 40:36.685
I thought not.

40:37.561 --> 40:38.729
<i>This man</i>

40:38.896 --> 40:43.234
cannot be allowed to bring discord
to our flourishing nation.

40:44.735 --> 40:46.028
<i>You're not the king!</i>

40:48.656 --> 40:50.366
<i>Off with his head!</i>

40:56.122 --> 40:57.206
<i>You're no king!</i>

41:34.743 --> 41:36.162
Protect the king!

41:36.328 --> 41:38.789
- Protect the king!
- Come.

42:02.396 --> 42:04.940
- Come on!
- Move! Move!

42:05.107 --> 42:06.817
Get the sword! Get after him!

42:07.026 --> 42:10.571
<i>The sword!</i>

42:15.034 --> 42:16.118
Move!

42:22.249 --> 42:24.210
Come on. Move!

42:33.260 --> 42:34.303
Come on!

42:35.262 --> 42:36.263
Now!

43:15.344 --> 43:18.347
Someone gonna tell me where we're going?

43:20.099 --> 43:21.183
No.

43:35.990 --> 43:37.700
So what is it you're looking at, then?

43:39.660 --> 43:42.037
Are you falling for me
like I'm falling for you?

43:43.497 --> 43:45.040
We wanna be careful.

43:49.878 --> 43:51.505
That's a neat trick.

43:51.672 --> 43:53.173
You'll have to teach me how to do that.

43:54.049 --> 43:55.467
Put him back on his horse.

44:16.196 --> 44:17.239
Oh, hello.

44:19.742 --> 44:22.077
It's quite dangerous
being one of you lot, isn't it?

44:22.828 --> 44:24.371
<i>You're good with animals, aren't you?</i>

44:24.830 --> 44:26.915
They have a word for that, don't they?

44:28.917 --> 44:30.002
"Mage."

44:30.919 --> 44:33.005
I thought your team was outlawed.

44:33.172 --> 44:35.132
<i>Never met one of you in the flesh.</i>

44:35.716 --> 44:37.593
I thought you'd be taller.

44:38.969 --> 44:39.970
And have a beard.

44:44.099 --> 44:46.185
You do know I can see through this?

44:46.852 --> 44:48.270
Trees everywhere.

45:13.128 --> 45:14.213
Hang that up.

45:14.380 --> 45:15.881
Don't want it getting creased.

45:35.317 --> 45:38.946
So, you're the chap
that turned in Goosefat Bill.

45:41.323 --> 45:44.952
Unlike you, he chose the wrong place to hide.

45:45.577 --> 45:49.832
You know he was the third most wanted man
on the Blackleg's list?

45:49.998 --> 45:52.251
They've been trying to catch him
for some time.

45:52.418 --> 45:55.003
Like I said, your man chose
the wrong place to hide.

45:55.587 --> 45:56.964
So it seems.

45:58.632 --> 46:00.926
I was wondering what happened to you.

46:01.093 --> 46:02.845
I told you, you were in safe hands.

46:03.011 --> 46:06.056
You've made quite a celebrity of yourself
among the Blackleg ranks.

46:06.223 --> 46:10.310
You've done very nicely on the back
of your cozy relationship with your kingsmen.

46:10.477 --> 46:13.147
You know, I'm a little old
for finger-wagging and speeches.

46:13.313 --> 46:17.568
So, unless you're my dad,
which, I believe, is unlikely,

46:17.734 --> 46:20.195
can you just get around to telling me
exactly what it is you want?

46:21.780 --> 46:23.365
What is it that you want?

46:23.657 --> 46:28.203
I want to get my arse out of here and see
what's left of my life and the people in it.

46:28.871 --> 46:30.706
<i>But you're not gonna let me do that, are you?</i>

46:30.873 --> 46:32.207
And why aren't we?

46:32.374 --> 46:33.667
You just lost two men.

46:35.711 --> 46:39.298
<i>But you were prepared to lose five
to save this pretty neck.</i>

46:39.465 --> 46:41.425
- Do I know you?
- You will in a minute.

46:41.842 --> 46:42.968
Put your hands out.

46:43.385 --> 46:44.720
I don't think so, mate.

46:44.887 --> 46:46.722
So I'm not going anywhere, am I?

46:46.889 --> 46:48.182
Where exactly were you thinking of going?

46:48.348 --> 46:50.392
You have no more home. It was razed days ago.

46:50.893 --> 46:52.728
<i>You've no more life to go back to.</i>

46:52.895 --> 46:55.105
Like it or not, this is your lot.

46:56.773 --> 46:58.734
And even we don't like you.

46:58.901 --> 46:59.943
Do we, Goosefat?

47:03.363 --> 47:09.119
But what we are interested in
is what you can do with this sword.

47:10.412 --> 47:13.749
Why don't you leave him with me
for a minute or two, boss?

47:17.002 --> 47:18.545
Put your ring back on, honey tits.

47:18.712 --> 47:21.673
You haven't had enough porridge
this morning to talk like that.

47:21.840 --> 47:25.761
And if you like that sword so much,
Your Lordship, you can keep it

47:26.345 --> 47:27.679
to peel your grapes.

47:29.389 --> 47:32.768
Now that would've hurt a lot more
if I left the ring on.

47:37.940 --> 47:40.359
I see what you're doing.

47:40.526 --> 47:42.903
You're trying to get me to do something
razzle-dazzle with that sword.

47:43.070 --> 47:47.533
I'm gonna tell you right now,
I'm not gettin' drawn into this mess.

47:47.950 --> 47:50.035
And there's an army of you.

47:50.202 --> 47:51.745
There's only one of me.

47:52.788 --> 47:54.873
I haven't had a fight for years.

47:55.791 --> 47:56.792
And I'll talk.

47:57.459 --> 47:58.710
I'm happy to talk.

48:00.087 --> 48:02.089
But there is no way

48:03.632 --> 48:05.384
that I am fighting.

48:43.839 --> 48:44.840
Is that it?

48:56.476 --> 48:58.729
<i>Run, son!</i>

49:48.070 --> 49:49.363
<i>Wait here, son.</i>

49:52.074 --> 49:53.200
<i>Run, son!</i>

50:02.793 --> 50:04.378
You are resisting the sword.

50:06.505 --> 50:08.548
The sword isn't resisting you.

50:08.715 --> 50:11.343
It should be clear by now

50:11.510 --> 50:15.597
that whatever it is that you
and your friends think you want from me,

50:17.140 --> 50:19.101
I am not it.

50:19.935 --> 50:22.104
- <i>Not yet.</i>
- Not ever!

50:23.647 --> 50:25.774
What do you see when you hold the sword?

50:27.943 --> 50:31.113
It is something you've seen before, isn't it?

50:31.279 --> 50:33.323
Long before you ever touched the sword.

50:35.033 --> 50:37.452
<i>You don't sleep well, do you?</i>

50:40.872 --> 50:43.208
What if you could make the dreams go away?

50:51.591 --> 50:53.218
You know what we have to do.

50:53.385 --> 50:57.472
In order for him to control Excalibur,
he needs to go to the Darklands.

50:57.639 --> 50:58.765
That's not happening.

51:00.308 --> 51:02.269
Welcome to the Darklands.

51:07.816 --> 51:08.817
That's the Darklands?

51:08.984 --> 51:10.277
That's the entrance.

51:13.822 --> 51:15.949
He needs to take the sword to the tower.

51:16.116 --> 51:18.285
You must touch the sword to the altar stone.

51:23.165 --> 51:24.166
Gonna miss me.

51:25.292 --> 51:27.210
- Give me another way.
- There's no other way.

51:28.336 --> 51:29.921
<i>And he has to go alone.</i>

51:39.514 --> 51:41.224
He can't survive the Darklands alone.

51:46.062 --> 51:48.023
- Are you scared?
- I think I can manage.

51:55.155 --> 51:56.448
You should be scared.

52:17.594 --> 52:19.137
That's what all the fuss is about?

52:43.453 --> 52:46.456
Don't worry, you'll soon understand
what all the fuss is about.

52:52.295 --> 52:54.256
You don't want all of him to survive.
That's the point.

52:54.422 --> 52:57.300
<i>You have to break his old self completely.
Wear him down.</i>

52:58.093 --> 52:59.219
You want him to think big?

53:02.097 --> 53:03.598
Give him something big to think about.

53:08.061 --> 53:10.105
You're playing with fire, Mage.

53:10.272 --> 53:12.315
And I'm not killing the king
before he's even become one.

54:29.851 --> 54:31.186
Wait here, son.

54:32.020 --> 54:33.063
No!

55:23.029 --> 55:24.030
Run, son!

56:51.326 --> 56:53.703
<i>Did you see everything you needed to see?</i>

56:54.829 --> 56:55.872
I saw enough.

56:58.833 --> 57:00.085
<i>The Mage Tower.</i>

57:00.668 --> 57:02.504
It's the same as the one at Camelot.

57:02.670 --> 57:05.673
The higher Vortigern builds it,
the more powerful he becomes.

57:05.840 --> 57:09.135
And when it is finished,
he will have the same power of Mordred.

57:09.469 --> 57:12.138
<i>That is why the sword
has revealed itself now.</i>

57:12.806 --> 57:15.558
Where there's poison, there's a remedy.

57:17.018 --> 57:18.686
What happened to your people?

57:19.896 --> 57:21.815
They were murdered by your uncle.

57:23.358 --> 57:25.527
It was Vortigern who started the wars.

57:26.361 --> 57:28.196
<i>He was jealous of your father's throne.</i>

57:29.155 --> 57:33.034
<i>So he made a deal with Mordred
that they would share power</i>

57:33.368 --> 57:36.538
<i>once he defeated your father.</i>

57:38.081 --> 57:41.459
<i>Mordred murdered the Mage King</i>

57:41.626 --> 57:44.754
<i>and took his staff to their sacred tower,</i>

57:45.922 --> 57:49.217
<i>where he unlocked the dark forces
of their union.</i>

57:54.430 --> 57:57.100
But what they didn't account for
was the sword.

57:57.934 --> 58:00.645
<i>Merlin stole his staff.</i>

58:02.689 --> 58:06.818
<i>He then forged the great sword, Excalibur,</i>

58:06.985 --> 58:09.529
<i>and destroyed the ancient tower.</i>

58:10.738 --> 58:13.658
<i>The sword was then passed
to the Lady of the Lake,</i>

58:14.242 --> 58:17.370
<i>who bound it to the Pendragon bloodline.</i>

58:21.624 --> 58:23.126
<i>Now,</i>

58:23.418 --> 58:25.420
<i>the sword is yours.</i>

58:27.547 --> 58:30.383
<i>It seems his people have been
found by the Resistance.</i>

58:31.009 --> 58:33.595
You have 10,000 men under your command

58:35.096 --> 58:37.265
for the purpose of maintaining public order.

58:37.432 --> 58:39.100
Informants have been incentivized.

58:39.267 --> 58:41.102
- Mercia...
- Our garrisons are patrolling the roads

58:41.269 --> 58:42.270
and searching every town.

58:42.437 --> 58:44.439
- It's only a matter of time, Your Majesty.
- Mercia.

58:44.606 --> 58:46.274
The Resistance have never posed
any real threat.

58:46.441 --> 58:47.442
Mercia!

58:51.112 --> 58:53.740
Just do your fucking job.

58:56.784 --> 58:58.369
Find him.

59:08.838 --> 59:10.298
Smaller than I thought it'd be.

59:10.465 --> 59:12.133
It's all yours, son.

59:13.051 --> 59:14.469
I warn you, it's got quite a bite.

59:16.512 --> 59:17.889
What they done back home?

59:19.766 --> 59:21.184
You really wanna know?

59:21.684 --> 59:22.769
Go on.

59:22.936 --> 59:24.145
It's all gone.

59:24.312 --> 59:25.313
They torched the lot.

59:26.522 --> 59:28.149
I said, go on.

59:29.150 --> 59:30.568
You should be flattered, mate.

59:32.654 --> 59:35.490
<i>Even Mercia left the castle
to look for you and that sword.</i>

59:38.618 --> 59:39.661
<i>Jack's Eye turned.</i>

59:40.495 --> 59:43.289
<i>Gave 'em a list of everything you valued.</i>

59:43.665 --> 59:46.251
<i>They slaughtered half the neighborhood.</i>

59:47.293 --> 59:50.004
<i>Mischief John got busy.</i>

59:50.213 --> 59:52.006
<i>Personally burned down the bridge.</i>

59:53.007 --> 59:54.634
It was quite a party.

59:55.009 --> 59:56.636
<i>Shall I continue?</i>

59:56.803 --> 59:58.179
What about the rest of the team?

59:59.347 --> 01:00:00.890
Most of the girls are with us,

01:00:01.683 --> 01:00:04.811
but the rest of the crew pretty much
got gist of your popularity

01:00:04.978 --> 01:00:06.479
<i>and made themselves scarce.</i>

01:00:07.730 --> 01:00:09.148
Blue, go get us something to drink.

01:00:09.941 --> 01:00:11.734
Come on, boss. I'm one of the crew.

01:00:11.901 --> 01:00:13.111
<i>Blue!</i>

01:00:25.415 --> 01:00:26.666
I'm all right!

01:00:54.819 --> 01:00:56.696
I'm gonna kill him.

01:00:57.238 --> 01:00:59.407
This lot have been trying to do it for years.

01:00:59.574 --> 01:01:01.284
They'd love to hear you say that.

01:01:02.493 --> 01:01:05.913
<i>They've waited a long time to see
a man pull this sword.</i>

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:08.082
I'm not doing this for them.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.293
Wet Stick,

01:01:11.127 --> 01:01:12.503
meet Percival.

01:01:14.881 --> 01:01:17.300
<i>Rubio, meet Back Lack.</i>

01:01:17.467 --> 01:01:18.593
Sir Bedivere,

01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:21.846
who runs this aristocratic family
of cave dwellers,

01:01:22.096 --> 01:01:24.766
<i>meet Blue, son of Back Lack.</i>

01:01:25.475 --> 01:01:27.268
The infamous Goosefat Bill

01:01:27.435 --> 01:01:28.728
<i>needs no introduction.</i>

01:01:28.895 --> 01:01:29.937
<i>So,</i>

01:01:30.938 --> 01:01:32.940
you think you can take down Vortigern?

01:01:33.107 --> 01:01:35.526
There are 12 barons.

01:01:35.693 --> 01:01:37.904
These represent the old families of England.

01:01:38.071 --> 01:01:41.532
<i>Between them, they can rustle up
12,000 warriors.</i>

01:01:41.699 --> 01:01:45.328
In order to stand a chance, we are going
to need at least some of their support.

01:01:45.495 --> 01:01:47.288
We can arrange a meeting
with six of those families...

01:01:47.455 --> 01:01:49.165
<i>Let me stop you there.</i>

01:01:49.332 --> 01:01:53.127
If I may, allow me to run you
through the proceedings

01:01:53.294 --> 01:01:55.129
as I think they will unfold.

01:01:55.296 --> 01:01:56.631
<i>They'll start by telling us...</i>

01:01:56.798 --> 01:01:59.967
If you're intending to galvanize
the people of this country

01:02:00.134 --> 01:02:03.513
against the current king,
there has to be a realistic strategy.

01:02:03.679 --> 01:02:05.681
Strategy requires leadership.

01:02:05.848 --> 01:02:09.936
Then they'll bang on for a while
about how clever and educated they are.

01:02:10.103 --> 01:02:12.814
In the art of war, diplomacy, and chivalry.

01:02:12.980 --> 01:02:14.607
And how under qualified I am.

01:02:14.774 --> 01:02:16.692
Is it not true that this man
was raised in a brothel

01:02:16.859 --> 01:02:18.820
<i>and has no formal education of any kind?</i>

01:02:18.986 --> 01:02:20.488
Then they'll start takin' the piss.

01:02:20.655 --> 01:02:22.323
And what are we to be called, Bedivere?

01:02:22.490 --> 01:02:24.200
"Knights of the Bordello"?

01:02:26.327 --> 01:02:28.913
Or "The Ladies of the Knight."

01:02:29.163 --> 01:02:30.289
Have you finished?

01:02:31.332 --> 01:02:32.500
I'm gonna have to pull 'em on it.

01:02:32.667 --> 01:02:34.085
I'm glad you've got a sense of humor.

01:02:34.502 --> 01:02:36.003
'Cause you're gonna need it.

01:02:36.170 --> 01:02:37.797
I'm gonna be forced to tell them...

01:02:37.964 --> 01:02:39.507
There's not a bollock between you.

01:02:39.674 --> 01:02:40.925
<i>At which point, Bedivere,</i>

01:02:41.092 --> 01:02:42.927
you're gonna get very angry, and tell me off.

01:02:43.094 --> 01:02:46.347
You'll say something along the lines of,
"What were you gonna do

01:02:46.514 --> 01:02:47.682
<i>"if they wanted to fight?" And I'm gonna say,</i>

01:02:47.849 --> 01:02:48.975
<i>"I was never gonna fight."</i>

01:02:49.142 --> 01:02:50.435
And you're gonna say,
"Well, what was gonna happen?"

01:02:50.601 --> 01:02:52.353
<i>And I was gonna say,
"That's what you're here for, Bedivere,</i>"

01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:54.188
"you big, silly, posh bastard."

01:02:59.193 --> 01:03:03.448
You want Vortigern to stick his neck out
and get him to Londinium?

01:03:03.614 --> 01:03:05.366
You need to tease it out.

01:03:05.533 --> 01:03:08.369
You don't need 12,000 fighting men for that.

01:03:08.536 --> 01:03:11.038
What you need is this little rabble.

01:03:11.706 --> 01:03:13.207
Okay, so how's that gonna work?

01:03:13.374 --> 01:03:17.545
If I'm moving too fast for you, Bedivere,
you can let yourself out the side door.

01:03:18.129 --> 01:03:20.715
You seem to have found your way very quickly.

01:03:21.048 --> 01:03:24.010
Now, come on, kid. You're cooking dinner.

01:03:24.177 --> 01:03:27.597
What is it that Vortigern cares about
most in the world?

01:03:27.889 --> 01:03:29.098
Killing you.

01:03:29.557 --> 01:03:30.600
Apart from that.

01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:32.351
Getting the sword.

01:03:32.518 --> 01:03:34.645
Could someone help me out here, please?

01:03:34.812 --> 01:03:36.564
- Finishing his tower.
- <i>So what do we do about it?</i>

01:03:36.731 --> 01:03:39.233
<i>Sink his barges carrying his supply
of stone. Block up the river.</i>

01:03:39.859 --> 01:03:41.861
Chaps, wouldn't it be easier
just to go through the side?

01:03:42.278 --> 01:03:44.572
See? That's the problem with an education.

01:03:44.739 --> 01:03:46.032
It gets in the way.

01:03:46.199 --> 01:03:48.409
These boats are made out of seasoned oak.

01:03:48.576 --> 01:03:49.827
They're uncrackable.

01:03:49.994 --> 01:03:52.079
So you need to go through the deck
to get to the keel.

01:03:52.246 --> 01:03:55.625
No, you need to go through the bulkhead
to get to the stern.

01:03:56.083 --> 01:03:57.210
What are you doing?

01:03:57.376 --> 01:03:58.419
You're wasting your time.

01:03:59.086 --> 01:04:00.755
I've told you they're uncrackable.

01:04:02.173 --> 01:04:03.674
<i>See, Wet Stick, Back Lack?</i>

01:04:03.841 --> 01:04:05.510
That's what an education gets ya.

01:04:06.844 --> 01:04:09.055
My sincere apologies, Your Majesty.

01:04:09.222 --> 01:04:11.807
The stone barges have been sunk,
and they've blocked the river.

01:04:11.974 --> 01:04:13.684
What else? Come on, more ideas.

01:04:13.893 --> 01:04:15.478
Interrupt his supply of slaves.

01:04:16.145 --> 01:04:17.897
<i>Excellent. How are we gonna do that?</i>

01:04:18.064 --> 01:04:19.524
We know their transportation routes.

01:04:19.941 --> 01:04:21.275
Oof! Now we're warmin' up.

01:04:32.453 --> 01:04:33.788
Come on, ideas.

01:04:34.497 --> 01:04:36.499
Burn his favorite palace down.

01:04:36.666 --> 01:04:37.792
How you gonna do that, then?

01:04:37.959 --> 01:04:39.919
I know the man that supplies brandy
to the palace.

01:04:40.086 --> 01:04:41.254
<i>Shipment first of the month.</i>

01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:42.672
All right, Dan. Wine or brandy?

01:04:42.838 --> 01:04:44.632
- Brandy.
- Open the doors.

01:04:50.638 --> 01:04:51.806
What a waste of brandy.

01:04:52.181 --> 01:04:54.642
But doesn't it make the palace burn well?

01:04:56.477 --> 01:04:59.480
10,000 boys. All under 12 years.

01:04:59.647 --> 01:05:03.150
Young enough to forget their families,
and to have no other loyalty than to you.

01:05:03.317 --> 01:05:06.153
Plus, 5,000 more each year

01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:08.823
for as long as you grant us passage
through your seas.

01:05:09.365 --> 01:05:10.533
The north is ours?

01:05:10.700 --> 01:05:11.993
That is our agreement.

01:05:23.504 --> 01:05:24.839
Is there a problem?

01:05:28.926 --> 01:05:31.429
There are rumors, Great King.

01:05:31.596 --> 01:05:32.847
Even across the seas,

01:05:33.014 --> 01:05:36.350
we have heard the legend of the sword,

01:05:37.310 --> 01:05:38.978
of a king

01:05:39.145 --> 01:05:41.981
other than yourself.

01:05:42.148 --> 01:05:45.693
I would be doing my own king a disservice

01:05:45.860 --> 01:05:48.446
if I did not ask this question.

01:05:51.741 --> 01:05:53.951
Are the boys yours to give?

01:05:54.410 --> 01:05:56.662
Do you really consider your faith
better served by a rumor?

01:05:57.038 --> 01:06:00.124
<i>Or by the word of the
conqueror of this island</i>

01:06:00.291 --> 01:06:04.045
with an army of 100,000 souls
behind his sword?

01:06:13.054 --> 01:06:17.141
I meant no disrespect, Great King.

01:06:33.866 --> 01:06:36.118
You asked to see me, Father?

01:06:39.246 --> 01:06:40.956
We need the support of all the barons.

01:06:41.123 --> 01:06:43.125
Set a meeting in Londinium.

01:06:43.292 --> 01:06:45.044
For the six we doubt.

01:06:45.211 --> 01:06:48.381
Whatever it takes to hunt him down.

01:07:26.377 --> 01:07:27.586
I still can't control it.

01:07:27.753 --> 01:07:28.796
Pick it up.

01:07:29.672 --> 01:07:31.006
You pick it up.

01:07:31.173 --> 01:07:32.299
Pick it up with both hands.

01:07:35.678 --> 01:07:37.638
Did you see everything you needed to see?

01:07:38.222 --> 01:07:39.265
Where?

01:07:39.432 --> 01:07:40.891
<i>In the Darklands.</i>

01:07:41.934 --> 01:07:43.102
Did you look away?

01:07:45.396 --> 01:07:48.607
You want to know why you still can't use it.

01:07:48.774 --> 01:07:49.900
Why don't you tell me?

01:07:50.067 --> 01:07:52.319
I think you know the answer.

01:07:52.695 --> 01:07:55.489
You will face it when it's worth it to you.

01:07:56.365 --> 01:07:59.076
<i>Don't get me wrong, I look away.</i>

01:07:59.243 --> 01:08:01.036
We all look away.

01:08:02.079 --> 01:08:04.707
But that is the difference
between a man and a king.

01:08:13.382 --> 01:08:14.425
Maggie!

01:08:15.509 --> 01:08:18.095
I thought we agreed
that you'd never come here.

01:08:18.261 --> 01:08:19.305
You need to hear this.

01:08:20.389 --> 01:08:23.267
Vortigern is making a visit to Londinium
to meet with the barons.

01:08:23.434 --> 01:08:25.185
- <i>He will travel by barge.</i>
- When?

01:08:26.562 --> 01:08:28.898
- Three days from now.
- Hmm.

01:08:29.523 --> 01:08:31.066
Looks like your plan worked.

01:08:31.859 --> 01:08:33.194
You need to be careful.

01:08:34.319 --> 01:08:36.322
<i>His power is increasing.</i>

01:09:31.335 --> 01:09:33.462
The building's right. The angle's right.

01:09:33.629 --> 01:09:36.048
Three exits from which to leave the city.

01:09:36.215 --> 01:09:39.426
A vantage point over the whole dock
and most of the town.

01:09:39.593 --> 01:09:42.095
It's a 50-yard shot. I can do that easily.
What's the problem?

01:09:42.513 --> 01:09:43.596
Tell him.

01:09:43.764 --> 01:09:45.099
Tell you what the problem is, mate.

01:09:45.265 --> 01:09:47.725
When you say the building's right,
I know the man that owns that building.

01:09:47.935 --> 01:09:49.937
<i>And he's not interested in letting anyone in.</i>

01:09:50.104 --> 01:09:51.689
How do you feel about
a rooftop king assassination?

01:09:51.856 --> 01:09:52.857
- My roof?
- Yeah.

01:09:53.023 --> 01:09:55.442
And least of all the king's assassins
that he'll have to hang for.

01:09:55.609 --> 01:09:57.111
- I'd hang?
- Probably.

01:09:58.821 --> 01:10:00.281
The three exits are actually only one.

01:10:00.447 --> 01:10:04.785
'Cause once the alarm arrow's fired,
the gates will be shut within two minutes,

01:10:04.952 --> 01:10:06.704
<i>and they're six minutes away by foot.</i>

01:10:06.871 --> 01:10:09.999
Unless you can run like
a Neapolitan stallion, I'd forget them.

01:10:10.165 --> 01:10:11.792
<i>So, you have one exit remaining.</i>

01:10:12.334 --> 01:10:14.211
And that has a tavern 20 yards from it.

01:10:14.545 --> 01:10:16.839
<i>There's always more Blacklegs
in the Two Hot Cocks</i>

01:10:17.006 --> 01:10:18.632
<i>than there are rats on the street.</i>

01:10:18.799 --> 01:10:21.468
Why don't you use the other building?
The one back here?

01:10:23.137 --> 01:10:24.972
Because it's 175 yards away.

01:10:25.180 --> 01:10:27.141
<i>And how far can you shoot, Back Lack?</i>

01:10:27.308 --> 01:10:29.602
Accurately? 75.

01:10:29.768 --> 01:10:30.936
<i>Bill?</i>

01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:32.521
175.

01:10:32.688 --> 01:10:33.731
Same as...

01:10:33.898 --> 01:10:36.150
No, he said, "175."

01:10:36.358 --> 01:10:39.028
All right, mate, of course you can.

01:10:49.538 --> 01:10:52.333
That's about 175 yards, isn't it?

01:10:52.499 --> 01:10:54.460
Well, he was supposed to signal.

01:10:54.627 --> 01:10:55.628
Can't see him.

01:10:55.794 --> 01:10:57.421
Well, we can't see them.

01:10:57.588 --> 01:10:58.923
And they can't see us.

01:10:59.089 --> 01:11:00.257
Hey!

01:11:02.051 --> 01:11:04.136
Maybe they thought that was luck.

01:11:06.263 --> 01:11:07.598
That could've killed us.

01:11:10.017 --> 01:11:12.645
They scream like girls, your friends.

01:11:18.734 --> 01:11:19.735
Bill?

01:11:19.985 --> 01:11:22.780
The wolf at the head of the pack.

01:11:23.322 --> 01:11:24.740
<i>Goosefat,</i>

01:11:24.907 --> 01:11:26.033
everything all right?

01:11:27.409 --> 01:11:28.702
- <i>Goosefat!</i>
- Mmm.

01:11:28.869 --> 01:11:30.537
Is there something I should know here?

01:11:30.704 --> 01:11:31.705
Those two have a history.

01:11:31.872 --> 01:11:33.707
Well, whatever it is,
that's not what we're here for.

01:11:33.958 --> 01:11:35.626
- Is it, Goosefat?
- Mmm.

01:11:35.834 --> 01:11:36.919
They've arrived.

01:11:39.296 --> 01:11:43.008
Maggie, I now realize what an important
member of my household you are.

01:11:43.175 --> 01:11:45.302
- Your Majesty...
- <i>I haven't finished.</i>

01:11:46.345 --> 01:11:47.638
Sit down.

01:11:49.556 --> 01:11:51.183
<i>Till recently,</i>

01:11:51.892 --> 01:11:55.145
I didn't recognize what a powerful tool
you can be in the right hands.

01:11:55.562 --> 01:11:57.690
<i>I thought you were simply a pawn.</i>

01:11:57.856 --> 01:12:00.484
<i>Turns out
you're a far more significant piece.</i>

01:12:00.651 --> 01:12:03.070
And it would be witless of me

01:12:03.237 --> 01:12:06.073
not to use that to my advantage,

01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:08.701
given how effectively
you've been used against me.

01:12:10.995 --> 01:12:12.746
<i>Hail to the king!</i>

01:12:13.205 --> 01:12:14.331
There's the king.

01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:25.467
Something doesn't smell right.

01:12:33.517 --> 01:12:34.601
<i>This is too easy.</i>

01:12:37.021 --> 01:12:38.814
Wait. Wait, wait. Don't fire.

01:12:38.981 --> 01:12:41.108
- Why not?
- Something doesn't smell right.

01:12:41.275 --> 01:12:43.193
It smells as right
as it's ever going to smell.

01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:45.320
Come on, he's right there.

01:12:45.487 --> 01:12:46.864
Bill! Get on with it!

01:12:47.031 --> 01:12:49.074
- It's a trap.
- How would he know?

01:12:49.241 --> 01:12:50.576
Don't know. Maggie.

01:12:50.784 --> 01:12:53.120
<i>Maybe he knows she's working for us.</i>

01:12:53.287 --> 01:12:55.497
I am telling you. That is not the king.

01:12:58.250 --> 01:13:00.627
Stop looking around and look at me.

01:13:01.211 --> 01:13:02.963
I'm a target, aren't I?

01:13:03.130 --> 01:13:05.257
God help us. They've sent me a buffoon.

01:13:06.967 --> 01:13:09.720
You are a cunning old bastard, Vortigern.

01:13:10.137 --> 01:13:11.722
<i>But what you fail to understand</i>

01:13:11.889 --> 01:13:16.018
is that it's you who's fed the hangman
that will eventually come for you.

01:13:17.519 --> 01:13:18.854
You're right, that's not Vortigern.

01:13:19.063 --> 01:13:20.439
But at least Mercia's here.

01:13:21.356 --> 01:13:22.941
<i>Goosefat.</i>

01:13:27.196 --> 01:13:29.531
What have you done?
You can't shoot if it's a trap!

01:13:29.698 --> 01:13:30.824
They'll never know where that came from.

01:13:32.576 --> 01:13:33.577
<i>You missed him anyway.</i>

01:13:35.454 --> 01:13:36.497
I didn't miss anyone.

01:13:43.253 --> 01:13:44.421
Arrow!

01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:53.806
What are you doing?
They're not targets at a fair!

01:13:53.972 --> 01:13:55.808
That was Clarendon. He earned that.

01:13:58.519 --> 01:13:59.686
<i>You might survive today.</i>

01:14:01.021 --> 01:14:02.606
But the noose has been tied.

01:14:07.027 --> 01:14:08.070
We need to go. Now!

01:14:08.237 --> 01:14:10.030
Now. We need to go now.

01:14:35.055 --> 01:14:36.056
Put your arms up.

01:14:41.603 --> 01:14:42.980
Hello, boys. Wait, wait.

01:14:43.147 --> 01:14:45.315
Hey, hey, hey. Where are you going? Stop.

01:14:50.988 --> 01:14:51.989
Oi! Oi!

01:14:54.116 --> 01:14:55.242
Sarge!

01:14:56.410 --> 01:14:57.619
Hey! Stop!

01:15:02.749 --> 01:15:03.834
Fuck me.

01:15:08.672 --> 01:15:09.673
Let's go!

01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:11.758
- I'm holding you up. Go on without me.
- No, Lack, come on. Let's go.

01:15:11.925 --> 01:15:13.093
- No, I'll see you at the safe house.
- I'm not leaving you!

01:15:13.260 --> 01:15:14.261
Just go!

01:15:16.221 --> 01:15:17.264
There they are!

01:15:28.859 --> 01:15:29.943
Move!

01:15:43.457 --> 01:15:45.167
This way, this way.

01:15:46.293 --> 01:15:47.461
Let's go!

01:15:47.961 --> 01:15:50.214
Move! Move! Move!

01:15:50.505 --> 01:15:51.506
Move!

01:15:51.673 --> 01:15:53.175
- Move!
- Move!

01:16:15.822 --> 01:16:18.033
- <i>Get out of the way!</i>
- Left! Go left!

01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:19.201
Over here!

01:16:21.078 --> 01:16:22.496
Argh!

01:16:31.171 --> 01:16:32.839
Hey. Here.

01:16:34.216 --> 01:16:35.550
In here. This way!

01:16:58.198 --> 01:16:59.241
We can't stay here.

01:17:00.701 --> 01:17:01.702
Where's Lack?

01:17:01.868 --> 01:17:03.662
- He's making his own way.
- All right.

01:17:03.829 --> 01:17:06.456
- How's Rubio?
- He's leaking, but he'll live.

01:17:06.623 --> 01:17:08.709
We need to get to the old bathhouse.

01:17:08.875 --> 01:17:10.544
If I go down, you follow him.

01:17:10.711 --> 01:17:12.504
If he goes down, you follow me.

01:17:13.213 --> 01:17:14.214
Come on.

01:17:30.814 --> 01:17:32.107
<i>There's too many. This way!</i>

01:17:33.233 --> 01:17:34.234
Come on!

01:17:34.443 --> 01:17:36.069
Come on, guys!

01:17:40.073 --> 01:17:41.074
Can you make it?

01:17:41.241 --> 01:17:42.242
I can make it, no problem.

01:17:46.997 --> 01:17:47.998
Over here!

01:17:48.165 --> 01:17:49.249
Hey! Come on!

01:17:56.798 --> 01:17:58.425
- Rubio!
- Come back!

01:17:58.592 --> 01:17:59.801
Rubio!

01:18:01.053 --> 01:18:02.095
Come on!

01:18:08.060 --> 01:18:09.269
They need your help.

01:18:25.911 --> 01:18:27.788
Lock the door, George.

01:18:32.834 --> 01:18:33.919
Get the lads out the back door, George.

01:18:34.086 --> 01:18:35.087
It's not gonna happen, boss.

01:18:35.253 --> 01:18:36.505
They hate the Blackleg and love a fight.

01:18:36.671 --> 01:18:37.714
There's too many of them.

01:18:37.881 --> 01:18:39.800
It's not gonna happen. They live for this.

01:18:39.966 --> 01:18:41.343
They're gonna die, George!

01:18:41.510 --> 01:18:43.095
They trained their whole lives for this.

01:19:00.153 --> 01:19:01.238
- Go on.
- Let go. Let go.

01:19:11.790 --> 01:19:13.083
Come on! Move!

01:19:13.250 --> 01:19:14.751
- Fight!
- Second rank!

01:19:14.918 --> 01:19:17.170
You two, down here.
It's a straight run to the river.

01:19:17.337 --> 01:19:18.338
You go first.

01:19:19.172 --> 01:19:20.841
We don't have time to argue, Bill.

01:19:21.007 --> 01:19:23.343
Some of us will make it out in time.
Some of us won't.

01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:24.845
Well, better some than none!

01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:26.805
You go first.

01:19:29.391 --> 01:19:31.351
Mike! Get down the hole.

01:19:32.144 --> 01:19:34.271
Mike, get down the hole.

01:19:34.438 --> 01:19:35.480
Don't like rats, boss.

01:19:36.773 --> 01:19:37.774
Dell.

01:19:37.941 --> 01:19:39.109
Scared of the dark.

01:19:39.276 --> 01:19:40.652
Really?

01:19:40.819 --> 01:19:42.529
George, will you tell them?

01:19:42.946 --> 01:19:43.989
Sorry, boss.

01:19:44.156 --> 01:19:45.323
Weapons!

01:19:49.703 --> 01:19:50.996
You silly bastards.

01:19:52.038 --> 01:19:54.416
Determined to die. Shit.

01:19:54.583 --> 01:19:56.376
On my command!

01:22:20.270 --> 01:22:21.813
I'm going down the hole now.

01:22:28.778 --> 01:22:30.113
After you.

01:22:32.949 --> 01:22:35.368
Blue. Blue. Where you been, mate?

01:22:35.535 --> 01:22:36.536
Where's my dad?

01:22:36.703 --> 01:22:38.246
We got split up, but he knows his way.

01:22:38.413 --> 01:22:39.456
- I've gotta find him.
- Wait, Blue.

01:22:39.623 --> 01:22:41.541
Your dad knows what he's doing.
He'll be back before you know it, mate.

01:22:41.708 --> 01:22:42.792
<i>Wet Stick.</i>

01:22:43.752 --> 01:22:46.421
Blue! Blue! Blue!

01:22:48.673 --> 01:22:51.217
Come on, boys! Search them dwellings now!

01:22:51.384 --> 01:22:53.219
Get through them doors!

01:23:02.937 --> 01:23:04.856
It's not gonna be easy
getting out of here now.

01:23:05.023 --> 01:23:07.776
You can't stay here long.
Nowhere in the city is safe.

01:23:07.942 --> 01:23:09.194
<i>The boat's ready.</i>

01:23:09.903 --> 01:23:11.946
<i>What about Back Lack and Blue, Art?</i>

01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:15.950
We'll wait until dark.

01:23:24.793 --> 01:23:26.419
<i>Where you been, Dad?</i>

01:23:26.586 --> 01:23:27.671
Catching me breath.

01:23:29.589 --> 01:23:30.799
What's wrong?

01:23:30.965 --> 01:23:32.926
Nothing. I'm all right.

01:23:33.093 --> 01:23:34.719
<i>Just got to get to the safe house.</i>

01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:37.972
Can you make it?

01:23:40.058 --> 01:23:41.226
I love you, mate.

01:23:42.435 --> 01:23:43.978
Come on, let's get going.

01:23:52.821 --> 01:23:53.905
Run!

01:23:57.826 --> 01:23:58.827
Down with Vortigern!

01:24:11.798 --> 01:24:14.551
It seems as though you found
a way to use the sword.

01:24:14.718 --> 01:24:15.969
<i>I wasn't controlling it.</i>

01:24:18.513 --> 01:24:19.723
Here.

01:24:20.724 --> 01:24:22.892
It was controlling me.

01:24:23.059 --> 01:24:24.644
I can't even remember what happened.

01:24:24.811 --> 01:24:26.146
I can.

01:24:28.398 --> 01:24:29.566
Thank you.

01:24:35.572 --> 01:24:37.824
Something's happening, you know?

01:24:39.576 --> 01:24:41.202
Certainly sounds like it.

01:24:41.369 --> 01:24:43.246
<i>People have seen what you can do.</i>

01:24:43.413 --> 01:24:44.664
<i>You're no longer a myth.</i>

01:24:45.415 --> 01:24:47.667
You're starting to mean something.

01:24:48.334 --> 01:24:49.669
That wasn't the intention.

01:24:49.836 --> 01:24:51.129
<i>They are fighting in your name.</i>

01:24:52.756 --> 01:24:55.300
I don't wanna wear that.

01:24:58.887 --> 01:25:00.472
Is that you, Blue?

01:25:00.638 --> 01:25:01.639
<i>Yes, boss!</i>

01:25:01.806 --> 01:25:02.849
Did you find your father?

01:25:03.266 --> 01:25:04.434
He's found him!

01:25:06.394 --> 01:25:07.437
Ah!

01:25:16.905 --> 01:25:18.198
We need to get you out of here.

01:25:18.448 --> 01:25:20.283
<i>Let's get your arse on that boat, Lack.</i>

01:25:20.450 --> 01:25:21.743
There's a good fog to cover our tracks.

01:25:22.494 --> 01:25:23.495
Come on.

01:25:23.661 --> 01:25:25.538
I'll need a little breather.

01:25:25.872 --> 01:25:28.374
Here, load everyone else up
and come back for me.

01:25:28.541 --> 01:25:29.542
No, I'll stay with you.

01:25:29.709 --> 01:25:31.961
No, you won't. Give 'em a hand.

01:25:35.298 --> 01:25:37.217
I'll be all right, mate.

01:25:37.550 --> 01:25:39.052
Just give me a minute.

01:25:40.220 --> 01:25:41.262
Come on, Blue.

01:25:42.430 --> 01:25:44.015
You carry this.

01:25:45.308 --> 01:25:47.101
Come on. Come on.

01:25:48.728 --> 01:25:50.522
<i>Come on, Blue.</i>

01:26:05.411 --> 01:26:06.746
<i>Evenin'.</i>

01:26:17.549 --> 01:26:18.800
Pardon the intrusion.

01:26:35.441 --> 01:26:37.861
Our dog was very keen to lead us here.

01:26:38.027 --> 01:26:39.153
Come on.

01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:41.114
Shall I pick him up, Sarge?

01:26:41.281 --> 01:26:43.366
No, follow him.

01:26:43.533 --> 01:26:45.159
<i>The blood he followed was from a man</i>

01:26:45.493 --> 01:26:47.120
<i>who killed one of my sergeants today.</i>

01:26:47.287 --> 01:26:52.125
A man who fled the scene
of an assassination attempt

01:26:52.417 --> 01:26:53.626
on me.

01:26:56.254 --> 01:26:57.839
On me, no less.

01:27:01.301 --> 01:27:03.261
You wouldn't happen to know
where that man is, would you?

01:27:06.472 --> 01:27:07.473
I can't.

01:27:07.974 --> 01:27:09.684
Get in the boat, Blue. I'll get your dad.

01:27:09.851 --> 01:27:11.144
I can't leave him!

01:27:12.228 --> 01:27:14.480
Have a look at this situation, would ya?

01:27:14.647 --> 01:27:16.774
The king of all England himself

01:27:17.191 --> 01:27:19.986
has made the effort to visit a commoner.

01:27:21.487 --> 01:27:23.323
A man from nowhere,

01:27:24.657 --> 01:27:26.951
and today, my last day.

01:27:29.704 --> 01:27:31.164
<i>You look well,</i>

01:27:31.331 --> 01:27:33.291
and I feel poor.

01:27:34.459 --> 01:27:36.127
But who would I rather be?

01:27:40.715 --> 01:27:41.716
What do you want, kid?

01:27:42.842 --> 01:27:44.093
Who's this young man?

01:27:44.552 --> 01:27:45.970
I'm the cleaner, sir.

01:27:46.471 --> 01:27:47.722
Who's he to you?

01:27:47.889 --> 01:27:49.265
Never seen him before.

01:27:49.891 --> 01:27:53.811
I usually come in later, you know,
do the dishes when they're all gone.

01:27:54.187 --> 01:27:55.313
Is that the truth?

01:27:55.480 --> 01:27:57.398
Yes, sir. I'd never lie to a Blackleg.

01:27:58.858 --> 01:28:00.485
Good boy.

01:28:03.821 --> 01:28:05.365
<i>So you don't know him?</i>

01:28:05.531 --> 01:28:06.741
No, sir.

01:28:09.202 --> 01:28:10.995
Then you wouldn't mind if I cut his ears off?

01:28:11.162 --> 01:28:13.081
<i>They're not my ears.
Do what you want with them.</i>

01:28:26.928 --> 01:28:28.096
No!

01:28:30.598 --> 01:28:33.184
Always wanted a boy.

01:28:33.393 --> 01:28:35.561
- Argh!
- You bastard!

01:28:36.062 --> 01:28:37.772
<i>Leave him alone!</i>

01:28:39.023 --> 01:28:41.025
Now I repeat,

01:28:41.275 --> 01:28:42.944
where's your friend?

01:28:46.072 --> 01:28:47.281
Let him go.

01:28:50.076 --> 01:28:51.077
Let him go.

01:28:55.248 --> 01:28:56.582
Take the boy and...

01:28:57.083 --> 01:28:59.252
No!

01:29:00.086 --> 01:29:01.546
No!

01:29:20.106 --> 01:29:23.276
Crush the Resistance tonight!

01:29:36.205 --> 01:29:37.540
Archers!

01:32:09.025 --> 01:32:12.236
<i>Let me show you</i>

01:32:14.572 --> 01:32:17.742
<i>what your uncle will do</i>

01:32:18.242 --> 01:32:21.746
<i>if you do not accept</i>

01:32:23.956 --> 01:32:25.791
<i>this sword.</i>

01:32:30.004 --> 01:32:32.256
<i>Only you can prevent this.</i>

01:32:36.219 --> 01:32:38.346
<i>He must be met</i>

01:32:38.512 --> 01:32:42.266
<i>where sword meets tower.</i>

01:32:44.769 --> 01:32:47.021
<i>Trust the Mage.</i>

01:32:48.356 --> 01:32:51.609
<i>Take it.</i>

01:33:36.779 --> 01:33:39.031
Apparently you have something to tell me.

01:33:54.171 --> 01:33:55.673
I suppose you wanna know what happened to me.

01:33:55.840 --> 01:33:58.384
I don't wanna push you, but...

01:33:58.551 --> 01:33:59.552
George?

01:33:59.969 --> 01:34:01.762
Riots are spreading.

01:34:01.929 --> 01:34:04.223
Not just in Londinium.
Across the whole country.

01:34:04.557 --> 01:34:05.933
<i>People are fighting for you.</i>

01:34:06.392 --> 01:34:08.019
If there was ever a chance, it's now.

01:34:08.227 --> 01:34:09.562
It's not going to last.

01:34:09.729 --> 01:34:12.773
But, like he said,
we're not going to push you.

01:34:13.274 --> 01:34:14.734
I'm ready.

01:34:16.193 --> 01:34:17.903
We're gonna take the castle.

01:34:19.530 --> 01:34:20.990
And we're going in the front door.

01:34:23.701 --> 01:34:26.579
George, I need you to go to Londinium,
gather the lads.

01:34:28.414 --> 01:34:29.457
Where's the Mage?

01:34:30.416 --> 01:34:31.917
She's back at the cave.

01:34:32.084 --> 01:34:33.252
All right.

01:34:33.669 --> 01:34:38.466
Now, when you say we're going to take
the castle, what does that mean?

01:34:40.259 --> 01:34:42.011
I thought you said you weren't gonna push me.

01:34:44.180 --> 01:34:46.182
Come on, lads. Chop, chop.

01:35:03.699 --> 01:35:04.700
<i>Blue!</i>

01:35:07.078 --> 01:35:08.120
Blue!

01:35:10.414 --> 01:35:12.333
- Blue!
- <i>Hello!</i>

01:35:14.835 --> 01:35:17.546
You took your time getting here.

01:35:22.802 --> 01:35:25.388
I'm not gonna hear the end of this
from my wife.

01:35:25.805 --> 01:35:27.473
It was my turn to cook tonight.

01:35:28.516 --> 01:35:32.812
I've been sent by His Majesty
to deliver a message.

01:35:36.148 --> 01:35:37.817
Let's think...

01:35:40.486 --> 01:35:43.489
"Be at the castle before dark"

01:35:43.656 --> 01:35:48.077
<i>"if you wanna see the girl and the boy"</i>

01:35:48.494 --> 01:35:49.662
"alive."

01:35:50.788 --> 01:35:52.415
<i>I would love to stay and chat,</i>

01:35:52.915 --> 01:35:55.668
but you do understand the situation

01:35:55.835 --> 01:35:57.378
between me and my wife.

01:36:03.759 --> 01:36:07.513
Anything that you do to me

01:36:08.848 --> 01:36:13.686
will be repaid 10 times in kind.

01:36:16.689 --> 01:36:18.274
Now, you're a big man.

01:36:19.733 --> 01:36:21.444
Now, let's see you move.

01:36:32.496 --> 01:36:33.831
Evening.

01:37:08.908 --> 01:37:10.075
So, where is he?

01:37:10.242 --> 01:37:12.953
He's a day's ride from here.

01:37:13.245 --> 01:37:14.705
<i>As soon as she's safe, he will come.</i>

01:37:15.414 --> 01:37:18.209
He poses no threat to you without the sword.

01:37:19.251 --> 01:37:20.544
<i>Tomorrow.</i>

01:37:21.295 --> 01:37:25.424
<i>I don't have to remind you
of what will happen if he doesn't come.</i>

01:37:26.717 --> 01:37:28.802
I'll start with the little boy.

01:37:29.470 --> 01:37:31.347
<i>Now, take the girl and go.</i>

01:37:39.772 --> 01:37:43.108
This venom will induce
that which is hidden from you.

01:37:43.275 --> 01:37:46.654
It will show you things
you do not want to see.

01:37:47.071 --> 01:37:49.114
But you'll need its protection.

01:37:49.740 --> 01:37:51.492
Hold my hand.

01:37:59.750 --> 01:38:00.834
I don't like snakes.

01:38:01.001 --> 01:38:02.962
No one likes snakes.

01:38:10.886 --> 01:38:11.971
<i>Stay with me.</i>

01:38:16.100 --> 01:38:17.142
Stay with me.

01:38:23.148 --> 01:38:26.318
You will feel it for a few hours.

01:40:03.791 --> 01:40:04.917
That's far enough.

01:40:07.753 --> 01:40:09.588
Let's get this done quickly, shall we?

01:40:10.297 --> 01:40:11.548
Put him on his knees.

01:40:13.300 --> 01:40:14.843
Put him on his knees!

01:41:46.643 --> 01:41:48.187
Go, go, go!

01:42:09.124 --> 01:42:12.044
You know the price.

01:42:24.223 --> 01:42:25.432
Father, what's happening?

01:42:26.183 --> 01:42:27.267
Leave.

01:42:34.900 --> 01:42:36.944
Why is there blood on your face?

01:42:40.155 --> 01:42:42.157
What's going on?

01:42:49.665 --> 01:42:51.750
Father, you're scaring me.

01:42:52.417 --> 01:42:53.710
Oh!

01:42:57.923 --> 01:42:59.633
I love you very much.

01:43:36.962 --> 01:43:38.505
<i>Come on!</i>

01:43:43.302 --> 01:43:44.344
Charge!

01:47:20.185 --> 01:47:24.106
You have won, nephew.

01:47:34.074 --> 01:47:37.369
You have won.

01:47:44.209 --> 01:47:47.504
Now, play with me.

01:48:14.030 --> 01:48:15.115
Ah!

01:48:38.138 --> 01:48:39.181
Ah!

01:48:48.440 --> 01:48:52.569
I think that sword belongs to me now.

01:48:59.451 --> 01:49:00.785
Run, son!

01:49:12.672 --> 01:49:14.341
Brother...

01:49:15.800 --> 01:49:19.179
I think that sword belongs to me now.

01:49:19.346 --> 01:49:21.348
Whatever price you pay,

01:49:21.514 --> 01:49:23.725
it will be more than you know.

01:49:29.689 --> 01:49:31.900
<i>You don't need to run anymore.</i>

01:49:36.196 --> 01:49:38.490
<i>You don't need to look away.</i>

01:49:50.377 --> 01:49:52.462
<i>The sword is yours, son.</i>

01:49:54.506 --> 01:49:55.507
Take it.

01:50:28.748 --> 01:50:31.543
You wanted to know what gave me such drive?

01:50:36.715 --> 01:50:37.841
It was you.

01:50:44.180 --> 01:50:45.682
You put me in that brothel.

01:50:54.065 --> 01:50:55.775
You cut me on the streets.

01:51:04.534 --> 01:51:07.162
I am here now because of you.

01:52:04.552 --> 01:52:06.137
You

01:52:06.554 --> 01:52:07.931
created me.

01:52:32.956 --> 01:52:33.957
And, for that,

01:52:34.124 --> 01:52:35.792
I bless you.

01:52:39.963 --> 01:52:42.090
You make sense of the devil.

01:54:10.428 --> 01:54:11.429
<i>Nock!</i>

01:54:14.891 --> 01:54:15.892
Light!

01:54:20.605 --> 01:54:21.856
<i>Ready!</i>

01:54:25.652 --> 01:54:27.237
Loose!

01:54:49.509 --> 01:54:51.302
<i>While I understand there's been a change</i>

01:54:51.511 --> 01:54:52.971
<i>in the leadership of this nation,</i>

01:54:54.430 --> 01:54:56.724
I am confident that you will still honor
the agreement

01:54:56.891 --> 01:55:00.228
made by your predecessor and my king.

01:55:01.187 --> 01:55:04.440
We expect to leave here
with 10,000 young men as agreed.

01:55:05.525 --> 01:55:06.943
Yeah, I don't think so, mate.

01:55:07.986 --> 01:55:08.987
Excuse me?

01:55:11.906 --> 01:55:13.199
I said, "I don't think so, mate."

01:55:16.744 --> 01:55:19.163
We've been wondering
what you were doing in here.

01:55:20.164 --> 01:55:21.541
I like it.

01:55:23.084 --> 01:55:24.085
What is it?

01:55:25.086 --> 01:55:26.129
<i>Yes, what is it?</i>

01:55:26.296 --> 01:55:28.840
A carousel? Giant wheel of cheese?

01:55:29.007 --> 01:55:30.091
<i>What are you supposed to do with it?</i>

01:55:30.258 --> 01:55:31.259
<i>I know.</i>

01:55:32.093 --> 01:55:33.469
It's a dance floor.

01:55:33.636 --> 01:55:37.140
And once you finish it, how are you
supposed to get to the middle?

01:55:37.307 --> 01:55:38.850
But how did you get it through the door?

01:55:39.017 --> 01:55:41.019
Did you carry it in? Or did you roll it in?

01:55:41.477 --> 01:55:42.770
<i>May I remind you,</i>

01:55:43.021 --> 01:55:47.775
a fleet of 3,000 longships controlling
the seas, surrounding your island.

01:55:48.109 --> 01:55:51.738
<i>It would be unwise to displease my king.</i>

01:55:52.238 --> 01:55:53.281
I'm sorry.

01:55:56.868 --> 01:56:00.038
George, Wet Stick, Percy, on your knees.

01:56:01.372 --> 01:56:02.665
Sir Bedivere, if you would?

01:56:05.460 --> 01:56:08.212
I'm prepared to extend the deadline
by a week.

01:56:08.379 --> 01:56:09.505
No.

01:56:10.340 --> 01:56:11.799
I mean, I'm sorry.

01:56:11.966 --> 01:56:13.593
You've made a mistake.

01:56:13.760 --> 01:56:17.472
You're no longer dealing
with the man you previously met.

01:56:18.473 --> 01:56:22.727
You are addressing England

01:56:23.102 --> 01:56:26.981
<i>and all the subjects
under her king's protection.</i>

01:56:27.148 --> 01:56:29.233
Arise, Sir George.

01:56:29.400 --> 01:56:31.069
<i>So you have a choice.</i>

01:56:31.277 --> 01:56:33.946
You can now kneel to England...

01:56:35.365 --> 01:56:37.367
Arise, Sir Tristan.

01:56:37.742 --> 01:56:39.577
...or I'll step off this throne,

01:56:40.411 --> 01:56:43.539
<i>and you can deal with me
as the man you previously met.</i>

01:56:45.375 --> 01:56:46.626
Arise, Sir Percival.

01:56:50.797 --> 01:56:52.382
And we can see how that goes.

01:56:58.930 --> 01:56:59.972
Sir William,

01:57:01.683 --> 01:57:03.017
if you would?

01:57:04.936 --> 01:57:06.104
It would be my honor.

01:57:30.002 --> 01:57:32.130
Well, now that's out the way,

01:57:32.296 --> 01:57:33.381
let's eat.

01:57:37.468 --> 01:57:38.553
<i>Why have enemies,</i>

01:57:39.721 --> 01:57:41.347
<i>when you can have friends?</i>

01:57:46.519 --> 01:57:48.730
Arise, my king.

01:58:01.200 --> 01:58:02.243
King Arthur.

01:58:09.917 --> 01:58:11.502
It's a table.

01:58:12.462 --> 01:58:14.088
You sit at it.

01:58:37.612 --> 01:58:41.157
<i>Long live the King! Long live the King!</i>

01:58:42.305 --> 01:58:48.328
