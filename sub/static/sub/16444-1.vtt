Can not move.

00:14.655 --> 00:16.282
Will die.

00:18.155 --> 00:20.304
What are you going to do Austin?

00:21.948 --> 00:23.270
How long...

00:23.553 --> 00:26.769
Must suffer before someone...

An end to his suffering?

She is waiting.

01:31.118 --> 01:33.281
Hello, Carolina.

01:36.226 --> 01:38.056
No, no, I...

01:38.789 --> 01:41.190
For... it's mom, she...

01:42.515 --> 01:44.006
Had an accident.

01:45.207 --> 01:46.884
Yes, what kind of an accident?

01:47.159 --> 01:49.960
<i>I found mother in the bathtub.</i>

01:52.141 --> 01:53.632
<i>E 'dead.</i>

01:55.986 --> 01:57.683
<i>How long does it come?</i>

02:20.218 --> 02:21.477
I'm sorry.

02:26.703 --> 02:28.601
<i>Small  hey.</i>

02:31.891 --> 02:33.531
<i>I ask you...</i>

02:33.532 --> 02:36.787
<i>Call me back as soon as possible, because...</i>

02:38.573 --> 02:40.806
<i>I have to tell you something about Mom.</i>

02:42.337 --> 02:44.017
<i>Ok, ok.</i>

02:49.651 --> 02:51.156
<i>Hey, D.</i>

02:53.495 --> 02:54.557
<i>I...</i>

02:55.580 --> 02:57.933
<i>Feel, I found Mom in the...</i>

02:58.695 --> 03:00.783
<i>In the bathtub. E '...</i>

03:03.359 --> 03:04.915
<i>It drowned.</i>

04:37.082 --> 04:38.490
Austin?

05:12.235 --> 05:14.206
You have taken the first flight.

05:14.500 --> 05:16.141
Austin hey.

05:16.919 --> 05:18.241
Carolina.

05:18.242 --> 05:21.317
No one calls me more
so outside the family.

05:23.087 --> 05:25.506
Well, I'm part of the family.

05:31.443 --> 05:33.319
"Carol" is not bad.

05:34.597 --> 05:35.749
There are...

05:35.750 --> 05:38.968
Carol Channing and Carol Burnett.

05:38.969 --> 05:42.186
- Austin.
- No I like it. There are...

05:43.386 --> 05:45.202
Carole Lombard...

05:45.523 --> 05:47.049
Lewis Carroll...

05:47.720 --> 05:49.383
Carol Brady.

05:49.843 --> 05:51.068
Are you drunk?

05:52.398 --> 05:55.078
Well, not yet, counselor.

05:59.535 --> 06:01.524
How much time has passed, Carolina? Type...

06:01.710 --> 06:03.852
- Three years?
- Two.

06:05.897 --> 06:07.084
And a half.

06:10.199 --> 06:12.760
This place looks like a mausoleum.

06:18.270 --> 06:21.518
The next few days will not be simple.

06:21.825 --> 06:24.498
I will do my part, Austin,
but I will not...

06:30.053 --> 06:32.918
When was the last
time you cooked?

06:32.919 --> 06:34.470
A few hours ago.

06:35.532 --> 06:40.060
When was the last time you cooked
a meal that was not ready?

06:40.265 --> 06:41.700
A few years ago.

06:41.701 --> 06:44.348
If Mom could see you
now, would be horrified.

06:44.591 --> 06:47.795
Well, if Mom could see
me now, I'd be shocked.

06:48.772 --> 06:50.230
Because she died.

07:03.723 --> 07:05.773
Pee. I have to pee.

07:27.263 --> 07:29.864
So, what have you done so far?

08:30.390 --> 08:31.879
Mom is in the tub.

08:33.441 --> 08:34.448
Yes.

08:35.851 --> 08:38.111
What? Mom is in the bathroom?

08:51.886 --> 08:53.546
She had to look good.

08:54.064 --> 08:55.501
I thought so.

09:09.607 --> 09:12.257
<i>Mom is in the tub!</i>

09:23.091 --> 09:25.116
Why is it still here?

09:27.885 --> 09:29.119
Austin...

09:29.402 --> 09:32.322
Because Mom's still here?

09:32.674 --> 09:34.918
There is preserved a corpse!

09:35.355 --> 09:37.210
There is a procedure to follow.

09:37.211 --> 09:39.228
A protocol.

09:40.201 --> 09:41.766
Have you called the police?

09:44.004 --> 09:47.051
Christ, Austin, you're un'incapace.

09:49.971 --> 09:51.893
Let's take a little 'air.

09:53.271 --> 09:56.542
<i>Hi, yes, I would like to report a death.</i>

10:01.010 --> 10:03.640
Yes? There's a dead body? Where?

10:04.309 --> 10:06.768
<i>- In the bathroom.</i>
- Who is calling?

10:08.755 --> 10:10.752
Carol Shaw. I...

10:11.120 --> 10:14.941
I .. well, I... I was Carol Baxter.
I am now Carol Shaw.

10:17.840 --> 10:20.897
Bax, you're back in town.

10:20.898 --> 10:21.909
Barton?

10:21.910 --> 10:23.492
Commander Brady, now.

10:24.110 --> 10:26.710
It 'nice to hear your voice.
What's up?

10:28.090 --> 10:30.544
Barton, is not a reunion.

10:30.545 --> 10:35.171
<i>We can focus on the body of
my mother rotting in the tub?</i>

10:35.172 --> 10:39.892
Yes, sorry. I apologize.
It 's just nice to hear your voice.

10:40.242 --> 10:44.627
Listen, get your ass here
and do your job, okay?

10:44.628 --> 10:46.331
<i>Yes, I will take...</i>

10:46.332 --> 10:47.953
<i>- I can just...</i>
- Hello?

10:47.954 --> 10:49.629
<i>For... average... legal.</i>

10:49.630 --> 10:50.793
Do you hear me?

10:51.680 --> 10:55.166
<i>- For... yes... everything... just...</i>
- Damn, here are all idiots?

10:55.167 --> 10:58.962
<i>No, I hear you perfectly, Bax.
I drag my ass right away on a boat.</i>

10:58.963 --> 11:02.832
Obviously if I can accomplish complicated
action like finding the keys.

11:02.833 --> 11:07.175
But, you know, we are in Branton. Your Q.I. drops
of at least 20 points if you stay too long.

11:07.176 --> 11:09.275
Okay, well, thank you. Appr...

11:09.571 --> 11:11.617
... Ezzo everything you do.

11:22.191 --> 11:23.492
Where are the keys?

11:25.305 --> 11:26.667
Hey, where are the keys?

11:59.381 --> 12:01.078
A little help?

12:16.354 --> 12:17.626
Thanks.

12:20.022 --> 12:21.039
Hey.

12:23.760 --> 12:25.161
I brought the cake.

12:30.410 --> 12:31.498
Where are the spirits?

12:31.499 --> 12:32.591
Are 13.

12:32.592 --> 12:34.887
I did not ask the time.
I just want a drink.

12:34.888 --> 12:36.354
There is a wide choice.

12:44.843 --> 12:47.507
Thanks, Mom.

12:47.955 --> 12:52.175
IN MOTHER OF OUR MEMORY

13:22.499 --> 13:24.353
How's my good girl?

13:24.354 --> 13:25.906
Hungry.

13:26.183 --> 13:27.569
Let's snack.

13:28.450 --> 13:29.540
Ok.

13:32.619 --> 13:33.619
Hey, Mort.

13:36.740 --> 13:38.141
E 'yours, Mary?

13:39.573 --> 13:41.302
I Do not know you had a daughter.

13:42.422 --> 13:45.337
I thought I'd surprise
the second round.

13:46.010 --> 13:47.412
It 's beautiful.

13:47.810 --> 13:49.076
As his mother.

13:59.700 --> 14:01.532
So, Sisyphus...

14:01.533 --> 14:04.471
What do you mean us then with those leaves?

14:05.687 --> 14:07.101
It 's funny?

14:07.342 --> 14:09.057
Are you having fun?

14:09.237 --> 14:12.458
It is amusing, to tell the truth.
Dallas is so fun.

14:12.459 --> 14:14.177
- So fun.
- Sure.

14:14.452 --> 14:15.736
I always enjoy.

14:16.037 --> 14:18.071
- That's right.
- OK, girls, let's talk.

14:19.770 --> 14:21.708
I got dressed to go to a funeral,

14:21.709 --> 14:24.605
Ok? So I'd like to know when
there will be, because...

14:24.687 --> 14:26.490
I thought it was all settled.

14:27.784 --> 14:31.412
Austin, how do you drown
in a bathtub by mistake?

14:34.911 --> 14:37.379
Technically, you can drown
in 5 centimeters of water.

14:37.380 --> 14:39.521
Dallas. Stop it.

14:39.956 --> 14:41.356
Clean calms me.

14:43.127 --> 14:45.503
What happened to Mom, Austin?
I have to know.

14:47.106 --> 14:48.904
All we need to know.

14:49.511 --> 14:51.893
Really? Because?
There were there when he was alive.

14:51.894 --> 14:53.821
Why should you care her death?

14:55.177 --> 14:56.895
What are you doing? What are you doing?

14:57.727 --> 14:59.466
No, no, no!

15:08.861 --> 15:10.409
- Oh God!
- Togliamotele from the mouth.

15:10.410 --> 15:12.480
No! You stink!

15:13.312 --> 15:15.554
You know that bothers
me the smell of sweat.

15:20.483 --> 15:22.447
- I need a drink.
- In the kitchen.

15:29.840 --> 15:32.104
Carolina, where are you going
to run away this time?

15:32.491 --> 15:33.705
On the West Coast.

15:40.176 --> 15:42.660
But it is the opposite coast!

15:43.213 --> 15:44.213
Well...

15:45.318 --> 15:49.087
- If you take the plane, you will need...
- I have money, Mom.

15:49.881 --> 15:51.856
I understand. The passport.

15:52.066 --> 15:54.245
You do not need a passport
to go to California.

15:54.246 --> 15:56.006
You need a document.

15:56.533 --> 15:59.220
If you have not noticed,
you are a minor, Carolina.

15:59.221 --> 16:00.275
Carol.

16:04.288 --> 16:07.100
I'm tired of being the one that you
must always take care of them.

16:07.416 --> 16:08.464
Already.

16:08.883 --> 16:12.191
- Your sisters love you.
- In Austin I do not care if I go.

16:12.413 --> 16:13.607
Yes you.

16:14.025 --> 16:15.624
She 'still does not know.

16:17.431 --> 16:19.373
- They need you.
- They need you!

16:27.789 --> 16:29.091
Hey, Bax.

16:33.450 --> 16:34.691
It 'nice to see you.

16:37.595 --> 16:40.384
You have not changed at all.

16:43.733 --> 16:45.306
E 'upstairs.

16:48.087 --> 16:49.214
Let's go.

17:03.400 --> 17:05.861
E ', sorry, right here...

17:06.291 --> 17:08.325
Behind door number 3.

17:10.116 --> 17:12.089
E 'in the tub.

17:15.546 --> 17:18.026
- Okay, I need...
- Yes. I'll leave you alone.

17:18.027 --> 17:19.330
Police procedures.

17:31.785 --> 17:34.033
Your mother was a remarkable woman.

17:34.875 --> 17:37.900
And I make you my
deepest condolences.

17:38.405 --> 17:42.249
When will it be someone to
take the mother's body?

17:43.595 --> 17:45.028
Well, there's a small problem.

17:47.451 --> 17:50.673
- What is it?
- It 'a book on how to commit suicide.

17:53.738 --> 17:57.047
I will bring the paramedics
soon as possible, but, first,

17:57.048 --> 18:00.887
I have to be a medical examiner
to control the crime scene.

18:00.888 --> 18:02.312
- The scene of the crime?
- You are welcome?

18:02.313 --> 18:04.437
Sorry. Unfortunate choice of words,

18:04.439 --> 18:07.217
Under the circumstances, but
there are rules to follow.

18:07.395 --> 18:10.544
At first, we must treat all
suicides as homicides.

18:10.545 --> 18:11.775
Bullshit.

18:12.189 --> 18:13.510
I'm sorry...

18:14.015 --> 18:16.167
As our mother has
to stay in the tub?

18:16.677 --> 18:18.829
It depends on how fast
can be the coroner.

18:18.830 --> 18:20.768
We are out of town for the weekend.

18:20.769 --> 18:23.231
- Fantastic.
- But we have one available.

18:23.934 --> 18:25.561
And what do we do in the meantime?

18:25.937 --> 18:27.620
Use the bathroom of the ground floor.

18:29.065 --> 18:31.088
That is, do not touch
anything in that room

18:31.089 --> 18:35.571
And not leave the island.
I have to question you all when I get back.

18:36.493 --> 18:38.585
We will talk next time, Bax.

19:29.323 --> 19:32.187
Wow. That's as it
should be a kitchen.

19:32.188 --> 19:33.188
No...

19:34.309 --> 19:35.560
Not yet.

19:37.544 --> 19:38.797
You could...

19:39.284 --> 19:40.450
Could you pass that?

19:40.945 --> 19:41.994
What?

19:44.056 --> 19:45.335
The spray!

19:45.984 --> 19:47.150
Oh, my God!

19:47.457 --> 19:49.191
- I'm fine!
- Power.

19:49.192 --> 19:52.198
If I do not the newspapers...

19:52.497 --> 19:54.085
Scattered on the floor!

19:54.511 --> 19:55.511
Do not...

19:56.010 --> 19:57.410
Touch!

19:59.213 --> 20:00.706
D, what is it?

20:01.377 --> 20:02.912
Nothing that concerns you.

20:03.867 --> 20:05.066
I'm just...

20:05.067 --> 20:07.293
Documents have to be
checked in Carolina.

20:11.970 --> 20:13.463
I'm divorcing Peter.

20:19.693 --> 20:20.992
It's all right.

20:24.594 --> 20:25.848
I hate myself...

20:26.495 --> 20:29.696
For starting, but I hate you more
if you do not I finish the matter.

20:32.510 --> 20:33.810
Already. Thank you.

20:38.428 --> 20:39.963
There would have left a note.

20:40.704 --> 20:42.170
A message?

20:43.007 --> 20:47.649
Already, this book has a list of things
you should do before you call it quits.

20:48.577 --> 20:52.048
And the number 15 is to prepare an explanatory
note on why you're going to kill you

20:52.049 --> 20:54.686
And attach it to your
will, such documents.

20:54.886 --> 20:57.252
Yes, but has not made a will, so...

20:57.532 --> 20:58.801
Are you sure?

21:00.103 --> 21:03.100
I'm would prepare one for free.

21:04.039 --> 21:06.517
The old lady liked to
hold on to his money.

21:07.269 --> 21:10.621
Okay, well, he says leave a copy in
an envelope addressed to the lawyer.

21:11.323 --> 21:12.463
You were his lawyer?

21:12.464 --> 21:14.883
Well, I can not engage
in Connecticut, so...

21:16.127 --> 21:17.127
Not.

21:17.798 --> 21:19.430
So, we call your lawyer.

21:20.476 --> 21:22.735
What makes you think
he left us something?

21:22.736 --> 21:24.727
She could barely
keep up the house.

21:24.964 --> 21:27.121
- It was very selfish.
- No it is not true.

21:27.803 --> 21:31.486
You have seen the best version of the
mother, thanks to all of us, honey.

21:31.771 --> 21:34.030
Do not do that. Do not say bad things.

21:34.123 --> 21:35.615
It 's too young to remember.

21:50.163 --> 21:52.480
We sing all for Dallas.

21:52.573 --> 21:56.642
It 'a jazz club, mom, with cigarettes
and alcohol. We're just little girls.

21:57.174 --> 21:58.741
Do not embarrass us.

21:58.869 --> 22:01.290
Hey, who invented the rule that...

22:01.316 --> 22:04.059
Children should celebrate the
birthday of Chuck E. Cheese?

22:04.060 --> 22:05.797
I like Chuck E. Cheese.

22:05.798 --> 22:08.123
Someone must have written the rules.

22:08.124 --> 22:11.585
The Baxter girls write
their own rules.

22:12.225 --> 22:14.410
Come on, make a wish.

22:21.431 --> 22:23.534
Happy birthday to me.

22:24.743 --> 22:26.113
Oh, my God.

22:26.114 --> 22:30.196
We will have to deal with Mom's
men, now that there's more?

22:32.259 --> 22:33.677
Be right back.

22:39.378 --> 22:40.783
Not again.

22:47.733 --> 22:49.270
Why do we go on?

22:50.718 --> 22:51.837
I know that look.

22:51.838 --> 22:53.135
What look?

22:53.136 --> 22:56.610
The look. What he had with
dad in Dallas and with your.

22:56.741 --> 22:58.437
Standing, come on.

23:01.290 --> 23:03.678
- You're not my mother.
- Someone has to be.

23:03.962 --> 23:05.615
Let's go... away.

23:17.232 --> 23:18.664
And this was Mom...

23:18.665 --> 23:19.768
Baltimore.

23:25.887 --> 23:28.366
What happened to Roger?
It 'still in Seattle?

23:29.165 --> 23:33.411
No, I put it into a hospice.
He has Alzheimer's.

23:34.486 --> 23:37.064
I'd rather die rather than
see them suffer in silence.

23:37.065 --> 23:41.792
Well, it is not quiet.
Shout against her visions.

23:43.565 --> 23:46.001
E 'common knowledge, you know? And 'hereditary.

23:47.115 --> 23:51.002
It means you're screwed, Carolina.

23:51.132 --> 23:52.385
It'll be fine.

23:52.386 --> 23:55.316
Oh, Dallas, you have
nothing to worry about.

23:55.317 --> 24:00.448
Sully died in a car accident.
That's not hereditary.

24:00.840 --> 24:05.378
<i>My father died because his
blood alcohol level was 0.22.</i>

24:06.020 --> 24:09.732
<i>Thought that crush the brakes
were as pinched against a tree.</i>

24:10.981 --> 24:12.333
<i>Alcoholism...</i>

24:12.980 --> 24:14.273
<i>It is hereditary.</i>

25:13.465 --> 25:15.185
There is this theater...

25:15.365 --> 25:20.693
In Palm Springs, which takes
just over seventy dancers.

25:22.115 --> 25:25.557
I have always dreamed of
retiring to Palm Springs

25:25.558 --> 25:27.678
To make a burlesque dancer.

25:27.679 --> 25:30.518
What is it? You think I could not do it?

25:30.519 --> 25:32.212
With these legs...

25:32.213 --> 25:33.688
I would be the best.

25:34.219 --> 25:36.277
You'd be standing ovation.

25:39.736 --> 25:40.736
So...

25:42.662 --> 25:44.673
I was thinking...

25:46.050 --> 25:47.253
July.

25:52.638 --> 25:54.038
This July?

25:55.689 --> 25:57.781
There's nothing wrong...

25:57.782 --> 26:00.373
In this July, Austin.

26:00.716 --> 26:02.711
Do not have plans.

26:04.122 --> 26:05.737
I may have.

26:06.014 --> 26:08.007
E 'comfortable.

26:08.544 --> 26:09.909
For whom?

26:12.877 --> 26:15.030
Here's what will happen.

26:15.301 --> 26:18.010
One Friday afternoon...

26:18.702 --> 26:21.457
Will call your sisters...

26:22.985 --> 26:26.021
And they will come for the weekend.

26:27.008 --> 26:28.493
This...

26:29.417 --> 26:32.244
Carolina will not fail to work...

26:32.245 --> 26:35.620
And Baltimore will not skip classes.

26:36.496 --> 26:38.073
E 'perfect.

26:38.956 --> 26:40.855
E 'perfect.

27:05.673 --> 27:07.460
Hey, Carolina.

27:09.218 --> 27:10.231
Come here.

27:10.362 --> 27:11.362
Come.

27:11.990 --> 27:15.071
- Come... come on. Stand up.
- Baltimore, what are you doing?

27:18.583 --> 27:20.920
Look, we just try to relax.

27:20.921 --> 27:24.306
We have to try to calm down
until things settle down...

27:24.307 --> 27:27.227
- And mom is pulled out of the tub.
- Okay, but I'm fine.

27:27.228 --> 27:28.662
Come on, at least...

27:28.663 --> 27:29.855
Try it.

27:31.577 --> 27:34.470
- Baltimore, what are you doing?
- I try to make you relax.

27:34.471 --> 27:36.213
Only... bend your knees.

27:36.214 --> 27:37.482
Bend your knees.

27:37.867 --> 27:38.867
So.

27:38.941 --> 27:40.662
You're a great dancer.

27:40.923 --> 27:42.420
I remember.

27:42.649 --> 27:44.666
- Relax.
- Oh, my God.

27:46.254 --> 27:47.521
Look at you!

27:47.522 --> 27:50.478
Yes, I think... that I relaxed.

27:50.774 --> 27:51.879
I also do.

27:52.245 --> 27:53.463
I'm relaxed.

27:56.302 --> 27:57.327
What is it?

28:00.070 --> 28:01.141
Dallas.

28:01.142 --> 28:02.564
Yes, I agree.

28:02.689 --> 28:05.139
He has taken off his shoes. People, is relaxed.

28:05.857 --> 28:08.840
I know it requires hard work to be perfect.
You have to match the...

28:08.853 --> 28:12.176
The bag at the foot of the enamel.

28:12.177 --> 28:15.633
- I do not.
- Yes you do, Dallas. Let's go.

28:16.478 --> 28:17.579
You know what?

28:19.991 --> 28:21.554
I bet...

28:21.860 --> 28:24.851
You bra and panties coordinates.

28:25.409 --> 28:27.429
- No, it's not true.
- Yes, you do, Dallas...

28:27.430 --> 28:29.823
- Come on!
- Mom always matched, you do too.

28:29.824 --> 28:31.481
- No, it's not true.
- Show her.

28:31.482 --> 28:35.379
- Why? No, I'll show you.
- Let me see. Take off your tights.

28:35.380 --> 28:37.413
- Listen...
- I'm not going to... Oh, my God!

28:37.414 --> 28:39.424
- Oh, my God!
- It 'a nice color.

28:39.425 --> 28:41.985
- Dallas, is an ass.
- Show him and that's it!

28:41.986 --> 28:43.521
Dai, the tights!

28:43.522 --> 28:48.092
That ancient torture device invented
by men for our merchandise!

28:48.395 --> 28:50.067
Get off of me!

28:50.068 --> 28:51.068
Enough!

28:51.148 --> 28:53.178
Viola fluo!

28:54.756 --> 28:56.036
Yay!

28:56.484 --> 28:58.070
Are you happy?

28:58.124 --> 28:59.187
You have caught!

28:59.188 --> 29:02.211
I do I match! I match, I always did!

29:02.212 --> 29:06.098
I am the perfect mom nock which has
always combined bra and panties!

29:08.923 --> 29:09.923
Dallas.

29:10.524 --> 29:12.697
Let's go, come on, calm down.

29:12.698 --> 29:15.639
I bet five US dollars
Carolina that matches them.

29:15.640 --> 29:18.935
- And your breasts are more beautiful than her.
- Hey! Shut up!

29:18.936 --> 29:20.201
I heard you!

29:20.202 --> 29:21.708
He does not accept the bet.

29:21.709 --> 29:23.313
Do you remember what Mom said?

29:23.314 --> 29:25.430
"Match increasingly panties and bra,

29:25.431 --> 29:27.458
- or unbridled laugh police."
- "Either the police will laugh without restraint."

29:27.459 --> 29:29.638
Ok, we're just kidding.

29:31.152 --> 29:33.175
Sorry, Dallas.

29:36.763 --> 29:37.813
I'm sorry.

31:29.635 --> 31:30.735
Hello, Mom.

31:34.003 --> 31:35.203
I'm Dallas.

31:37.834 --> 31:39.561
I know that we do not see...

31:41.165 --> 31:42.394
A long time.

31:43.542 --> 31:44.642
I'm sorry.

31:46.910 --> 31:48.908
Things at home are not going so well.

31:50.616 --> 31:53.236
You know, Peter has changed. It '... it is...

31:56.796 --> 31:57.996
It is not true.

32:01.772 --> 32:04.349
Me are called so many times.

32:09.984 --> 32:11.034
It's me.

32:13.975 --> 32:15.272
I am changed.

32:17.282 --> 32:18.282
I...

32:22.948 --> 32:25.803
So I see myself in you.

32:26.683 --> 32:29.978
And I rejected you
for so long that...

32:34.751 --> 32:37.017
I lost a part of me in the street.

32:40.522 --> 32:42.707
I'm so sorry that we
have moved away, Mom.

32:43.930 --> 32:45.031
Hail Mary...

32:45.247 --> 32:48.050
Full of grace, the Lord is with you.

32:48.051 --> 32:49.750
You are blessed among women

32:49.751 --> 32:51.858
And blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

32:53.431 --> 32:55.117
Holy Mary, Mother of
God, pray for us sinners

32:55.118 --> 32:56.999
Now and at the hour of our death.
Amen.

33:53.075 --> 33:55.240
How long you have not seen Mom?

33:56.399 --> 33:58.074
- Christmas.
- No.

33:58.075 --> 34:00.095
You were in Hawaii.

34:01.528 --> 34:03.359
Right, Easter.

34:04.632 --> 34:06.107
You had the case O'Hagin.

34:06.806 --> 34:09.098
How do you know my life better?

34:10.217 --> 34:11.574
Do you admire.

34:11.719 --> 34:12.819
Literally.

34:13.904 --> 34:15.011
The point is that...

34:15.012 --> 34:17.704
None of us saw her mother
for more than a year.

34:18.139 --> 34:19.373
Except Austin.

34:23.322 --> 34:25.639
Girls, I'm reading this book

34:25.639 --> 34:28.596
And I am convinced that Mom
has planned this long ago,

34:28.597 --> 34:30.089
And has left us a note.

34:30.270 --> 34:34.190
You can not. Statistically, not
premeditated suicide are much more common.

34:34.192 --> 34:37.667
Ok, but it has checked all
the points on the list.

34:37.668 --> 34:39.945
Let me see this list.

34:42.572 --> 34:46.155
"Number 1: be sure to be
incurable medical condition."

34:47.029 --> 34:48.940
I heard last week.
It was fine.

34:48.942 --> 34:50.386
Last week?

34:50.605 --> 34:52.000
Ok, last month...

34:52.001 --> 34:53.690
Feel, if she had been sick,

34:53.692 --> 34:55.809
He would tell one of us.

34:56.313 --> 34:58.352
We fought the last
time I heard it.

34:59.243 --> 35:01.214
Do not you know that
would be the last time.

35:02.195 --> 35:04.466
I do not think this is the
writing of the mother.

35:10.041 --> 35:12.803
- No, Carolina's right, is not his.
- How do you know?

35:12.816 --> 35:15.304
She taught to write
thank-you notes and on.

35:16.564 --> 35:18.302
'A good habit to get into.

35:40.693 --> 35:43.070
THE KEYS OF PANDORA JAR

35:44.463 --> 35:45.843
Are you kidding?

35:45.844 --> 35:48.165
It's not just "Pulp Chiclet." This...

35:48.166 --> 35:50.273
"Pulitzer"  cries.

35:50.301 --> 35:52.682
Well, maybe not "Pulitzer".
But definitely something.

35:52.813 --> 35:55.443
Well, he is a friend of Oprah.
Do you know what that means?

35:55.444 --> 35:56.494
Oprah?

35:58.045 --> 36:00.875
Well, you have until the end of the
day, or I'll call Simon & Schuster.

36:02.239 --> 36:04.015
Austin, how are you?

36:04.277 --> 36:06.798
You look fantastic. Really.

36:07.105 --> 36:08.305
Are you lost weight?

36:11.503 --> 36:13.963
- Oh, did you sick.
- Thing?

36:14.957 --> 36:17.186
"You look fantastic," it is...

36:18.244 --> 36:19.582
Is not a euphemism for...

36:19.583 --> 36:21.997
"Make yourself comfortable
before infringes your dreams"?

36:22.093 --> 36:23.151
No.

36:23.152 --> 36:24.709
If you were to offer a drink...

36:24.710 --> 36:27.449
It would be an understatement.
Do not be paranoid.

36:27.538 --> 36:29.597
So, how's your mom?

36:30.125 --> 36:32.378
- Well.
- And how's Sarah?

36:32.843 --> 36:34.402
- Well.
- Good.

36:37.483 --> 36:38.721
It made me sick.

36:39.027 --> 36:40.945
I really did suck.

36:41.103 --> 36:43.550
Although I did not even understand what it is.

36:43.770 --> 36:47.320
What is it? What's up, Austin?

36:47.321 --> 36:49.179
It 'a diary?

36:49.695 --> 36:51.666
There is a manuscript.

36:52.220 --> 36:54.552
You've had two years.

36:54.984 --> 36:58.111
I scribbles and fragments.

36:58.502 --> 37:01.141
"The keys of Pandora's" Vase was...

37:01.686 --> 37:03.464
Transcendental.

37:03.465 --> 37:07.460
One of the best works of your
generation, of any generation.

37:07.560 --> 37:08.660
But, Austin...

37:14.431 --> 37:15.855
I have a reputation.

37:16.523 --> 37:17.795
Too.

37:28.744 --> 37:30.588
Austin, why did you come home?

37:32.259 --> 37:35.207
You said you came here to
write, but writing for years.

37:35.208 --> 37:36.559
Where is the result?

37:40.046 --> 37:42.778
In my head. E 'carefully hidden.

37:43.312 --> 37:45.142
Okay, well, then put it black on white.

37:46.836 --> 37:48.036
I'm committed.

37:48.052 --> 37:50.340
Bullshit. Find your priorities.

37:52.875 --> 37:55.217
You know much priority.

38:10.386 --> 38:11.586
Miss Baxter?

38:12.372 --> 38:13.696
We are ready to begin.

38:14.603 --> 38:15.603
Yes.

38:16.350 --> 38:18.878
I have to wait my sister.
It will be here soon.

38:19.198 --> 38:21.899
If we do not reach an agreement
before the TSE, we will go to trial.

38:21.900 --> 38:23.509
I think they like it just as we do.

38:23.510 --> 38:25.773
And if we play heavy,
will reduce the number.

38:27.925 --> 38:29.340
You must respond, Carol?

38:36.310 --> 38:37.310
Yes.

38:52.074 --> 38:53.074
Ok.

38:53.591 --> 38:55.298
I'm late? E 'already started?

38:55.782 --> 38:57.954
- No.
- Oh, thank goodness.

38:57.955 --> 39:01.595
I would not have ever forgiven.
That is, Austin Baxter is a genius.

39:01.596 --> 39:03.591
This book has changed my life.

39:06.331 --> 39:08.132
- Hello.
- Hello.

39:09.753 --> 39:11.997
Well, there is a free
place right here before.

39:13.740 --> 39:15.160
Here he says "confidential."

39:15.831 --> 39:16.931
Well, for you.

39:18.921 --> 39:20.201
I'm Sarah.

39:20.202 --> 39:22.178
- Austin.
- I know who you are.

39:22.278 --> 39:23.482
Really?

39:26.705 --> 39:29.507
- E 'in the bathroom, honey.
- You know I did not even...

39:31.360 --> 39:32.943
Thank you, dear.

39:37.655 --> 39:40.429
It 's so nice to see you all here. Health.

39:40.708 --> 39:42.944
- Health.
- At mom's cooking.

39:42.947 --> 39:45.300
- Thank you, Mary.
- Thanks Mom.

39:45.301 --> 39:47.366
The turkey is huge.

39:47.601 --> 39:49.700
- Well, health.
- I love it when Carolina was drunk.

39:50.018 --> 39:52.162
I can not wait to see him.
No, I can manage alone.

39:52.525 --> 39:54.434
We decided who cut it?

39:54.769 --> 39:57.124
Sarah. Sarah cut it.

39:57.125 --> 39:59.308
No, no, no. I'm sorry.
Maybe next year, darling.

39:59.319 --> 40:01.690
- E 'out here.
- Thank you thank you.

40:01.807 --> 40:03.569
- It 's really good.
- I'll see how it goes.

40:03.570 --> 40:05.131
Ok. I love you.

40:05.297 --> 40:08.324
- A check on the food?
- Well, I want to make sure it's cooked...

40:08.325 --> 40:09.637
- This year.
- Ok, health.

40:09.638 --> 40:12.160
- Happy Thanksgiving to all!
- Health.

40:15.101 --> 40:16.427
I slipped.

40:16.428 --> 40:18.990
- Did you fall.
- I stumble.

40:19.001 --> 40:22.082
Did you fall again.
God, you broke something, this time?

40:22.615 --> 40:23.895
I'm fine.

40:24.103 --> 40:26.001
I have to sit alone.

40:26.843 --> 40:29.810
Okay, but first let us get up.

40:29.811 --> 40:32.954
Look there. Get me an apron.
Fast fast.

40:32.962 --> 40:36.080
I do not want your sisters
see me like this.

40:41.046 --> 40:42.617
Oh.

40:43.003 --> 40:44.365
Look at this.

40:44.366 --> 40:46.215
I got it. Do not worry.

40:48.448 --> 40:50.041
I better go. No...

40:50.136 --> 40:52.312
I can not.

40:53.175 --> 40:54.175
Ok.

40:58.245 --> 41:00.076
Ok, folks.

41:00.304 --> 41:03.251
Dinner will be ready in ten minutes.

41:03.553 --> 41:07.994
I see you've already drunk the wine.
School of drunkards.

41:07.995 --> 41:09.779
You just got your mother.

41:09.780 --> 41:12.239
- Health.
- Well, health.

41:12.242 --> 41:14.775
- Thanks for the invitation.
- Thanks for inviting us.

41:26.755 --> 41:29.670
Look what I found
among the things mom.

41:31.437 --> 41:33.819
Too bad that can not smoke it.

41:36.775 --> 41:38.411
But if you're smoking right now.

41:38.621 --> 41:39.900
This is legal.

41:40.004 --> 41:42.642
Okay, well, this is medicine.

42:02.658 --> 42:03.758
Really?

42:04.074 --> 42:05.174
Really?

42:05.352 --> 42:10.117
Baltimore, I'm about to become the youngest
woman judge of King County. IS'...

42:10.310 --> 42:12.152
Bad, that one.

42:12.473 --> 42:13.573
Dallas.

42:14.084 --> 42:16.280
Mom you left her in his will.

42:16.561 --> 42:17.561
Well...

42:17.688 --> 42:19.055
If it's a family heirloom...

42:20.065 --> 42:21.411
Oh, Dallas.

42:21.865 --> 42:22.965
What is it?

42:23.143 --> 42:24.243
Smoking...

42:25.048 --> 42:26.148
Marijuana...

42:26.162 --> 42:27.403
Rarely.

42:27.645 --> 42:30.392
Usually when under pressure...

42:31.214 --> 42:32.314
Or drunk.

42:32.918 --> 42:36.029
Currently, they are under pressure.

42:36.263 --> 42:39.120
And I'm going to be
even more drunk.

42:44.216 --> 42:45.316
Milady?

42:54.699 --> 42:56.496
What was happening to my mother?

42:58.962 --> 43:00.246
It was out of my mind?

43:02.162 --> 43:04.497
Should I worry myself
to go out of your mind?

43:06.122 --> 43:08.060
It 's too late. Already out of his mind.

43:08.239 --> 43:09.698
The  us all.

43:09.794 --> 43:11.620
Yes, well, he speaks for yourself.

43:12.511 --> 43:14.239
You are a hopeless case.

43:14.438 --> 43:15.438
You are...

43:16.294 --> 43:19.994
An exquisite cocktail of
neurosis and hypertension.

43:20.548 --> 43:22.861
Yes, well, then I'd say
they're just like my mother.

43:22.987 --> 43:26.028
- Mom was not a hopeless case.
- No, you're right, he was sane

43:26.037 --> 43:27.932
Because it is what
they do all sane.

43:27.942 --> 43:32.014
You wake up one morning and say:
"Today is a lovely day.

43:32.300 --> 43:34.418
I think I'll make me out."

43:35.474 --> 43:38.500
No, Carolina. A basket case...

43:38.514 --> 43:41.287
Is someone who discovers he
has ALS and does nothing,

43:41.294 --> 43:46.139
While the disease devours the body as long
as the only functioning organ is the brain.

43:53.565 --> 43:55.299
Mom had ALS?

43:58.578 --> 44:00.114
What is ALS?

44:00.662 --> 44:01.662
A Time...

44:02.662 --> 44:05.074
Called Lou Gehrig's disease.

44:05.485 --> 44:08.088
Every cell in the body
degenerates, except the mind.

44:09.722 --> 44:11.372
She had it all planned.

44:11.536 --> 44:13.141
Sorry.

44:14.777 --> 44:16.501
Mom knew she was sick?

44:17.971 --> 44:19.755
Why did not he say?

44:23.017 --> 44:24.117
Fantastic.

44:24.681 --> 44:29.225
- I'm ready to talk about it, if you want.
- And what is there to say?

44:29.917 --> 44:33.548
Our mother has organized this
magnificent reunion between sisters...

44:33.720 --> 44:35.130
For his death...

44:35.253 --> 44:37.894
- And he has not spoken to any of them.
- Have you spoken to me.

44:37.895 --> 44:42.037
Of course, Austin. You were here.
But we are four of us, remember?

44:42.038 --> 44:45.951
- But it was his choice.
- Austin, use common sense.

44:46.584 --> 44:48.912
- You had to reject the choice.
- We're not in court.

44:48.918 --> 44:50.749
You know what?
You should have called me.

44:50.750 --> 44:54.374
I would have spoken and
I convinced him not to.

44:54.745 --> 44:56.984
- Suicide is wrong.
- You're talking...

44:57.140 --> 45:00.366
The law or your conscience?

45:00.660 --> 45:03.470
You could have done something
and did not do anything.

45:03.637 --> 45:05.251
I did something.

45:05.447 --> 45:08.464
I came home and I took
care of our mother.

45:08.465 --> 45:11.739
- I'm sorry if it's not enough for you.
- It is not.

45:14.002 --> 45:15.629
You should have told us.

45:18.472 --> 45:20.654
I'm really mad at you.

45:23.744 --> 45:25.949
It was also my best friend.

45:34.984 --> 45:38.362
You are the only one who can do it, Austin.

45:42.949 --> 45:46.214
Carolina would tell me that it is wrong...

45:46.215 --> 45:49.038
Legally and ethically.

45:50.398 --> 45:51.700
Dallas...

45:51.981 --> 45:54.119
Can not stand clutter.

45:56.845 --> 45:59.590
E Baltimore is too young.

45:59.881 --> 46:01.666
This would mark forever.

46:08.821 --> 46:11.434
If I tried alone...

46:11.645 --> 46:13.458
I would make a mess.

46:14.311 --> 46:16.911
It 'better to succeed at the first attempt.

46:17.403 --> 46:21.335
It should be embarrassing to
have almost committed suicide.

46:21.336 --> 46:25.165
I could never get over the embarrassment.

46:30.864 --> 46:33.486
They come to terms with all this.

46:34.779 --> 46:36.998
You have to understand...

46:37.703 --> 46:39.808
I want to take back control.

47:00.859 --> 47:02.047
<i>Next.</i>

47:04.249 --> 47:05.778
My favorite daughter.

47:06.374 --> 47:08.007
Something to eat?

47:08.008 --> 47:09.635
How about a felafel?

47:09.978 --> 47:11.464
I hate falafel.

47:11.465 --> 47:13.427
You have always been
picky in terms of food.

47:13.965 --> 47:15.303
And what do you know?

47:16.482 --> 47:17.898
Me that your mother used to say.

47:19.576 --> 47:21.820
Well, the father comfortable doing so.

47:22.277 --> 47:26.367
The report cards, menstruation, dancing...

47:26.600 --> 47:30.814
All the most important moments of my
teenage years have gone by fax or e-mail.

47:31.034 --> 47:33.735
You came to talk about
your mother or you?

47:36.752 --> 47:38.441
It's not the same thing?

47:38.802 --> 47:40.447
Well, you're here.

47:40.777 --> 47:42.337
Me, Austin.

47:53.181 --> 47:56.190
Why did not your mother told
your sisters who is sick?

48:00.172 --> 48:02.248
Why would not you tell him?

48:03.709 --> 48:07.322
I think it's because he wants to
remember it as it was before...

48:08.817 --> 48:10.982
Strong, full of life...

48:11.788 --> 48:14.506
- A force of nature.
- He said it to you.

48:14.507 --> 48:16.134
I'm his best friend.

48:21.617 --> 48:23.182
I can not do.

48:23.183 --> 48:24.662
Yes you can.

48:29.002 --> 48:30.832
I'm proud of you, Austin.

48:33.222 --> 48:34.412
Thanks.

48:35.324 --> 48:37.832
I thought that parents had
to protect their children.

48:37.850 --> 48:39.285
The she requested to you.

48:39.580 --> 48:41.383
Because you are a coward.

48:41.384 --> 48:43.794
He asked you for a reason.

48:47.463 --> 48:48.836
Do you believe in God?

48:54.183 --> 48:56.469
- Does it matter?
- It matters.

48:56.470 --> 48:57.773
Do you believe in God?

48:57.774 --> 49:01.153
I do not want a philosophical
discourse with you.

49:01.154 --> 49:02.544
Philosophical?

49:03.649 --> 49:06.044
- What?
- You said "philosophical."

49:06.045 --> 49:08.867
If I believed in God, you would
not have said "theological"?

49:09.913 --> 49:11.454
Do you believe in God?

49:15.070 --> 49:16.070
No.

49:16.900 --> 49:18.968
So Mary has chosen the right person.

49:22.979 --> 49:24.536
<i>Do you really want to do it?</i>

49:29.436 --> 49:33.359
<i>You can afford a nurse, why
do not you hire a nurse?</i>

49:34.409 --> 49:38.148
<i>- It makes no sense.
- I do not leave with a stranger.</i>

49:44.172 --> 49:46.046
<i>Why must fall all about you?</i>

49:46.848 --> 49:49.039
<i>Why nobody can give you a hand?</i>

49:51.573 --> 49:55.083
You said you were coming to help
me, why are you standing there?

49:56.742 --> 49:58.286
You are not forced to do so.

49:58.287 --> 50:01.976
- No, I have no choice.
- Instead you've got a choice.

50:03.847 --> 50:05.648
He needs me.

50:05.908 --> 50:07.537
Yes, me too.

50:08.715 --> 50:11.817
You have a life, Austin.
Do you want to give up everything?

50:15.315 --> 50:17.022
This is my life.

50:17.840 --> 50:19.446
No, it's his life.

50:32.549 --> 50:33.839
Treasury?

50:35.009 --> 50:36.892
Where are you?

50:39.850 --> 50:41.108
There they are.

50:42.069 --> 50:44.778
What are you doing down here?

50:46.423 --> 50:48.983
Are you okay? You have a little 'fear, right?

50:51.324 --> 50:52.324
Hey.

50:53.444 --> 50:54.931
Do you want to sing a song?

50:54.948 --> 50:59.587
# She has long hair
to the navel... #

50:59.588 --> 51:03.325
# Long ears up to the sky... #

51:03.326 --> 51:07.213
# A face that makes you happy... #

51:07.333 --> 51:10.676
# And a sweet smile
like an apple pie. #

51:10.694 --> 51:12.409
As a cupcake cherry!

51:12.410 --> 51:17.351
# And a sweet smile
like a cake cherries. #

51:17.923 --> 51:22.256
# Come, come to my house... #

51:23.717 --> 51:27.704
# Come, come to me... #

52:03.803 --> 52:05.122
Austin!

52:07.849 --> 52:09.175
Where's Austin?

52:09.850 --> 52:10.850
Yes?

52:11.738 --> 52:13.611
Why Mom does not stink?

52:14.616 --> 52:16.848
No, I'm serious, because it does not stink?

52:16.849 --> 52:19.992
- Did you sniff?
- No, I did not sniff.

52:20.731 --> 52:23.414
But the point is that it makes no sense.

52:23.862 --> 52:28.782
It 's impossible that his body does not
face like all the dead bodies decompose.

52:29.541 --> 52:32.725
If mom died last night...

52:32.726 --> 52:35.717
And we arrived this
morning, then...

52:38.463 --> 52:39.463
No.

52:39.814 --> 52:40.814
No.

52:44.772 --> 52:46.426
What I'm not understanding?

52:49.893 --> 52:52.240
Oh, Austin.

52:53.402 --> 52:55.082
Please tell me that you did not do.

52:56.491 --> 52:58.304
What am I missing?

53:00.934 --> 53:05.803
If someone does not say what I did
not understand me, I'll kill myself.

53:13.023 --> 53:15.742
Mom was alive, when
you call last night?

53:42.388 --> 53:44.745
Hello, Carolina.

53:47.719 --> 53:50.485
No, no, I...

53:51.224 --> 53:53.157
For... it's mom, she...

53:54.372 --> 53:56.000
Had an accident.

54:02.833 --> 54:05.548
I found mother in the bathtub.

54:07.663 --> 54:09.554
E 'dead.

54:12.145 --> 54:13.963
How long does it come?

54:27.129 --> 54:28.678
Baltimore.

54:32.074 --> 54:34.829
How do I say it in Baltimore?

54:35.462 --> 54:36.462
You...

54:37.748 --> 54:39.701
Will understand.

54:57.518 --> 54:59.604
Thank God, there is the secretariat.

55:02.489 --> 55:05.058
Small  hey.

55:07.542 --> 55:09.369
I ask you...

55:09.370 --> 55:12.292
Call me back as soon as possible, because...

55:14.255 --> 55:16.361
I have to tell you something about Mom.

55:18.451 --> 55:19.461
Okay.

55:20.223 --> 55:21.457
Ok, ok.

55:23.178 --> 55:24.720
Mom was still alive.

55:24.957 --> 55:26.552
So when she died?

55:27.721 --> 55:28.892
At 11:30.

55:30.241 --> 55:31.257
Last night.

55:33.571 --> 55:34.755
Morning.

55:39.244 --> 55:41.273
I arrived at 11:30.

55:43.245 --> 55:45.126
That's because Mom does not stink.

55:55.475 --> 55:56.484
It 'been...

55:56.806 --> 55:58.519
It was horrible.

57:59.831 --> 58:01.998
- All right, honey?
- Yes, all right.

58:09.682 --> 58:10.692
Yes.

58:20.461 --> 58:22.136
- Oh God, I'm doing wrong?
- No.

58:22.137 --> 58:23.261
- Yes, no.
- No?

58:23.262 --> 58:24.471
- No.
- Ok.

58:27.429 --> 58:28.824
Okay, now...

58:30.254 --> 58:31.954
You just slip inside.

58:41.070 --> 58:42.460
How is the temperature?

58:43.769 --> 58:46.385
It 'really perfect.

58:49.630 --> 58:50.754
You did it.

58:56.831 --> 58:58.501
I think galleggerai.

58:58.674 --> 58:59.684
Yes.

59:00.230 --> 59:02.226
- Yes.
- Can I leave?

59:39.234 --> 59:41.004
I'm ready, Austin.

59:43.037 --> 59:45.230
Hey, listen.

59:47.559 --> 59:49.383
You know the rules.

59:51.281 --> 59:52.806
Do not say anything.

59:53.289 --> 59:54.535
Trouble Nothing.

59:55.332 --> 59:56.404
Ok?

59:56.405 --> 59:57.415
Ok.

59:58.085 --> 59:59.307
I'm ready.

01:00:21.714 --> 01:00:22.724
Hey.

01:00:23.370 --> 01:00:24.617
I love you.

01:00:37.057 --> 01:00:39.200
So. Ok.

01:00:41.142 --> 01:00:42.374
Done everything.

01:00:43.214 --> 01:00:45.967
Now we just wait...

01:00:46.846 --> 01:00:48.868
That medicines...

01:00:49.315 --> 01:00:50.524
Take effect.

01:00:55.891 --> 01:00:57.735
Thank you, Austin.

01:01:13.237 --> 01:01:14.490
Who is it?

01:01:21.812 --> 01:01:23.134
Carolina is ahead.

01:01:23.805 --> 01:01:24.948
Immediately.

01:01:25.291 --> 01:01:27.591
- We have to do it now.
- Thing?

01:01:28.212 --> 01:01:29.429
You must help me.

01:01:29.761 --> 01:01:31.945
You must help me, I can not...

01:01:31.946 --> 01:01:33.528
Do it alone.

01:01:33.994 --> 01:01:36.198
- Austin, you must help me!
- No!

01:01:36.199 --> 01:01:37.669
Please, please.

01:01:38.927 --> 01:01:42.618
Come on, honey, we do the
count of three, okay?

01:01:42.619 --> 01:01:43.624
One...

01:01:44.328 --> 01:01:47.130
Two, three. Please, Austin, now.

01:02:25.873 --> 01:02:27.082
<i>Austin?</i>

01:02:57.308 --> 01:02:59.723
You killed her.

01:03:02.837 --> 01:03:04.482
It did not happen.

01:03:04.928 --> 01:03:06.001
She was...

01:03:10.069 --> 01:03:12.187
Carolina, was very weak.

01:03:13.144 --> 01:03:15.249
It could not even work.

01:03:15.993 --> 01:03:17.052
And it was...

01:03:18.221 --> 01:03:19.858
It was what he wanted.

01:03:19.859 --> 01:03:21.286
She was just...

01:03:23.127 --> 01:03:24.784
I need my help.

01:03:26.329 --> 01:03:27.751
What you did...

01:03:28.285 --> 01:03:29.471
It is illegal.

01:03:32.744 --> 01:03:33.990
Denunciami.

01:03:34.173 --> 01:03:35.196
Ok...

01:03:36.766 --> 01:03:38.174
E 'decided, then.

01:03:38.911 --> 01:03:39.921
Oh.

01:03:40.778 --> 01:03:42.018
Carolina.

01:03:42.241 --> 01:03:45.891
- Stop it, it's your sister.
- That killed my mother.

01:03:46.212 --> 01:03:47.672
E 'so Oedipus.

01:03:47.673 --> 01:03:49.492
Do not joke!

01:03:50.548 --> 01:03:51.552
Treasury!

01:03:52.106 --> 01:03:55.989
You had a minute to process
what, I three years!

01:03:57.666 --> 01:03:59.360
You had no right to do so.

01:04:00.104 --> 01:04:02.791
If I had been here and I
saw what was happening,

01:04:02.792 --> 01:04:04.439
You would have done the same thing.

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:07.516
Do not tell me what I would do,
I would never have killed her!

01:04:09.540 --> 01:04:10.986
You played at being God.

01:04:11.182 --> 01:04:15.094
- You put on a moral pedestal...
- Shut up! Shut up!

01:04:17.017 --> 01:04:19.023
Mom was dying!

01:04:19.245 --> 01:04:21.342
It gave me no choice!

01:04:21.456 --> 01:04:24.198
I have to live with that!

01:04:25.379 --> 01:04:26.506
Oh!

01:04:31.258 --> 01:04:33.335
You three are not involved.

01:04:33.785 --> 01:04:36.052
So go ahead to play the
judge, Carolina...

01:04:36.175 --> 01:04:37.995
You're off the hook.

01:04:39.713 --> 01:04:41.140
The report you.

01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:45.289
Enough, stop it!
Think for a moment about what you're doing.

01:04:45.835 --> 01:04:48.887
- Do I want to send her to prison?
- He killed our mother.

01:04:48.888 --> 01:04:51.171
- He said he was already dying.
- No...

01:04:51.172 --> 01:04:53.494
- We could have had more time with her.
- Stop fighting!

01:04:55.693 --> 01:04:58.807
We have to commemorate the mother lives,
it is what she would have wanted.

01:04:59.202 --> 01:05:00.327
Yes, commemorate.

01:05:10.133 --> 01:05:12.687
- We could have had more time.
- You know Mom.

01:05:14.454 --> 01:05:16.704
- You know she would not have given choice.
- No.

01:05:25.455 --> 01:05:26.994
Oh, it's crazy.

01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:44.403
Carolina.

01:05:53.189 --> 01:05:54.330
To her mother.

01:05:57.691 --> 01:05:58.812
To her mother.

01:06:03.713 --> 01:06:04.748
Carolina.

01:06:20.489 --> 01:06:22.124
What you did it is illegal.

01:06:22.244 --> 01:06:24.175
E 'pitiful state.

01:06:25.204 --> 01:06:27.720
Do you have any idea
how to lose control?

01:06:29.505 --> 01:06:30.836
Come on, of course not.

01:06:30.837 --> 01:06:33.427
You've always been perfect ever
since you exit from the uterus.

01:06:34.721 --> 01:06:36.851
We know it all, you're the best.

01:06:37.223 --> 01:06:38.487
What's your point?

01:06:38.488 --> 01:06:40.071
Do you want to become a judge.

01:06:41.270 --> 01:06:44.489
Do not judge a person until you know
how it feels to be in his shoes.

01:06:45.540 --> 01:06:47.296
You would have done the same.

01:06:47.770 --> 01:06:49.095
E 'bullshit...

01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:50.402
And you know it.

01:06:55.706 --> 01:06:57.274
I do not feel well.

01:06:57.582 --> 01:06:59.551
You have been drinking.

01:07:01.177 --> 01:07:02.647
No, just...

01:07:03.115 --> 01:07:04.685
- Oh God!
- Sore...

01:07:04.686 --> 01:07:07.053
- Carolina!
- Oh God!

01:07:07.054 --> 01:07:09.530
- What it's going on? What did?
- What's wrong?

01:07:09.531 --> 01:07:10.435
Do you hear me?

01:07:10.436 --> 01:07:11.895
- Carolina.
- Can you hear me?

01:07:11.896 --> 01:07:12.890
Carolina?

01:07:12.891 --> 01:07:14.172
Oh, my God.

01:07:16.835 --> 01:07:18.812
E 'deoxyneuroprene.

01:07:19.416 --> 01:07:21.554
- Carolina, Carolina.
- It is not permanent. Because a...

01:07:21.555 --> 01:07:24.588
Temporary paralysis of
all muscle functions.

01:07:32.361 --> 01:07:33.889
Take a spider.

01:07:34.263 --> 01:07:35.539
There are a lot...

01:07:35.765 --> 01:07:37.754
Down there, amid the vines.

01:07:42.770 --> 01:07:44.385
What I miss...

01:07:44.934 --> 01:07:46.558
Most of all...

01:07:47.170 --> 01:07:48.899
It is sex.

01:07:51.133 --> 01:07:56.065
Young people do not think that
even old people having sex...

01:07:56.561 --> 01:07:58.039
But we do...

01:07:58.621 --> 01:08:00.311
And we love it.

01:08:01.230 --> 01:08:03.007
We love so well.

01:08:04.083 --> 01:08:06.735
It 's just all a bit' slower...

01:08:07.267 --> 01:08:09.573
How it is at your age.

01:08:11.742 --> 01:08:13.347
Imagine...

01:08:13.654 --> 01:08:17.184
Be a prisoner of his
own body, trapped.

01:08:18.401 --> 01:08:22.916
I was a ballerina, for God's sake.
The dancers dance.

01:08:23.609 --> 01:08:25.774
I had beautiful legs.

01:08:27.399 --> 01:08:33.201
Sometimes, I danced for 16 hours
straight, until my feet bleed.

01:08:34.194 --> 01:08:37.055
And then I complained for pain.

01:08:38.072 --> 01:08:39.888
Imagine.

01:08:43.215 --> 01:08:44.941
They're not angry.

01:08:44.942 --> 01:08:46.171
No more, now.

01:08:48.082 --> 01:08:49.537
Before I was.

01:08:50.930 --> 01:08:53.258
When did the muscle
stiffening...

01:08:54.174 --> 01:08:56.997
I cursed to be grown old.

01:08:58.499 --> 01:09:00.718
And when respiratory
problems started,

01:09:00.719 --> 01:09:04.318
I cursed science because
it is not a cure.

01:09:06.743 --> 01:09:10.618
And when my own body
started to give in...

01:09:11.198 --> 01:09:13.048
I cursed God.

01:09:13.049 --> 01:09:15.144
God is an easy target.

01:09:19.129 --> 01:09:21.144
I do not want to be fed...

01:09:21.541 --> 01:09:24.051
Through a tube that reaches
me in the stomach.

01:09:25.344 --> 01:09:27.144
I do not want to breathe...

01:09:27.256 --> 01:09:29.305
Through a hole in the neck.

01:09:31.328 --> 01:09:33.064
I'm ready, Austin.

01:09:36.518 --> 01:09:37.749
What do you want from me?

01:09:39.077 --> 01:09:42.957
I want you to do
exactly what I ask.

01:09:44.673 --> 01:09:46.504
Now off...

01:09:47.237 --> 01:09:50.328
Half of the legs of the spider.

01:09:51.572 --> 01:09:53.356
Just do it.

01:10:13.163 --> 01:10:14.743
What is she doing?

01:10:15.065 --> 01:10:17.162
Nothing. It does not move.

01:10:19.467 --> 01:10:21.439
Can not move.

01:10:21.998 --> 01:10:23.673
Will die.

01:10:25.394 --> 01:10:27.297
What are you going to do Austin?

01:10:29.219 --> 01:10:30.569
How long...

01:10:30.808 --> 01:10:33.942
Must suffer before someone...

01:10:34.366 --> 01:10:36.663
An end to his suffering?

01:10:37.615 --> 01:10:39.098
She is waiting.

01:11:04.712 --> 01:11:06.610
How long should the effect?

01:11:07.063 --> 01:11:09.239
E 'in this condition
for about 45 minutes.

01:11:09.853 --> 01:11:13.239
- I do not know.
- Well, I guess, Dr. Kevorkian.

01:11:13.801 --> 01:11:15.842
15 minutes?

01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:18.023
Christ, 15 minutes?

01:11:18.024 --> 01:11:20.691
- It was supposed to be.
- What did you have in mind?

01:11:20.692 --> 01:11:23.084
Drugging one of us at random, so as to
make us understand how was the mother

01:11:23.085 --> 01:11:25.584
And hope not to die too?

01:11:28.036 --> 01:11:30.514
He made also take you.
Not so, Austin?

01:11:31.402 --> 01:11:35.105
Did you take the pole-doxy...
what's his name.

01:11:35.106 --> 01:11:37.397
- What it is.
- Yes.

01:11:37.411 --> 01:11:39.480
Ok, ok. How long
has taken effect?

01:11:40.086 --> 01:11:43.148
- 15, maybe 20 minutes?
- Oh, Christ.

01:11:43.149 --> 01:11:45.451
So why is it so such an hour?

01:11:45.452 --> 01:11:49.278
I do not know. He drank a lot, maybe
that's why the effect is stronger.

01:11:50.069 --> 01:11:52.948
I do not know. I think it is
better to let him dispose.

01:11:52.949 --> 01:11:54.348
Are you kidding?

01:11:54.664 --> 01:11:56.197
I call the doctor.

01:11:56.198 --> 01:11:57.198
No.

01:12:00.228 --> 01:12:02.446
Girls, the beat is strong.
And 'only asleep.

01:12:02.447 --> 01:12:04.692
- Is not much of a problem.
- Austin, I call 911.

01:12:04.693 --> 01:12:06.379
Take care far. Take care far.

01:12:06.380 --> 01:12:07.416
- Dallas, Dallas.
- Enough!

01:12:07.417 --> 01:12:09.058
Seriously, it's not a good idea.

01:12:09.140 --> 01:12:11.295
Come on, come on. Give me the
phone, give me that phone.

01:12:11.296 --> 01:12:13.870
- No! Leave me alone!
- I'm stronger than you.

01:12:13.871 --> 01:12:17.027
You are much screwed...
That's for sure.

01:12:22.772 --> 01:12:24.535
I do not know you anymore.

01:12:24.536 --> 01:12:27.003
Come on, you've never known.

01:12:29.741 --> 01:12:31.893
Congratulations, Austin.

01:12:32.263 --> 01:12:36.811
Have you isolated in this
house with your mother.

01:12:36.812 --> 01:12:39.958
You have no idea how
my everyday life.

01:12:49.574 --> 01:12:50.614
You're right.

01:12:58.419 --> 01:12:59.745
Oh, shit.

01:13:00.141 --> 01:13:02.019
Oh, my God, Carolina!

01:13:02.895 --> 01:13:04.016
Dallas.

01:13:04.017 --> 01:13:05.667
What? Oh, my God.

01:13:05.867 --> 01:13:08.114
- What are you doing?
- Oh, my God.

01:13:08.115 --> 01:13:12.067
Treasury, you have to go out
there to entertain Brady.

01:13:12.068 --> 01:13:13.558
I can not do it, I can not.

01:13:13.559 --> 01:13:16.463
Please, Dallas, look at me.

01:13:17.051 --> 01:13:19.201
Do not bring it into the house.

01:13:20.138 --> 01:13:21.608
You can take time?

01:13:22.311 --> 01:13:23.557
Please!

01:13:23.879 --> 01:13:25.133
- Oh, my God.
- Yes.

01:13:25.134 --> 01:13:27.539
- It gets worse every time.
- It gets worse every time.

01:13:27.540 --> 01:13:28.762
- Austin.
- Yes Yes Yes.

01:13:28.763 --> 01:13:30.478
Force, take her by the legs.

01:13:34.512 --> 01:13:35.960
Captain Brady.

01:13:35.961 --> 01:13:37.786
Oh, my God.

01:13:37.787 --> 01:13:40.149
- You have arrived really early.
- We were lucky.

01:13:40.150 --> 01:13:42.637
- Dallas, he is Dr. Timmins.
- You call me just Peter.

01:13:42.638 --> 01:13:44.827
Well, it returned from fishing
with a day in advance.

01:13:44.828 --> 01:13:47.810
Yes, that old puddle of water
was as dry as the desert.

01:13:51.583 --> 01:13:53.610
Here. Put it here.

01:13:53.611 --> 01:13:56.074
Let's go, honey.
Wake up, come on, you have to wake.

01:13:57.367 --> 01:13:58.359
Ok. Oh God.

01:13:58.360 --> 01:13:59.653
- Carolina?
- WATER.

01:13:59.654 --> 01:14:01.376
Hey, Carolina, wake up.

01:14:01.377 --> 01:14:02.998
Oh, my God. It can not be true.

01:14:02.999 --> 01:14:07.044
It 's great to have you here, sir.

01:14:07.545 --> 01:14:10.186
We are really fortunate, Dr.
Timmins...

01:14:10.187 --> 01:14:12.608
To welcome her home Baxter.

01:14:12.864 --> 01:14:14.325
- Can we come in?
- No.

01:14:14.815 --> 01:14:15.954
You know...

01:14:17.256 --> 01:14:18.786
I brought a cake.

01:14:19.618 --> 01:14:22.080
Carolina. my darling, wake up.
Wake up.

01:14:22.081 --> 01:14:23.625
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:14:26.917 --> 01:14:29.682
Oh, excuse me, but I
always want it to.

01:14:29.683 --> 01:14:32.358
You know what? It 'a wonderful evening.
Why do not you stay here...

01:14:32.359 --> 01:14:34.884
While I prepare and I give
her servant on the patio?

01:14:34.885 --> 01:14:38.145
No, no, no, no, no. Thank you.
I've already eaten. I'm... I'm...

01:14:38.146 --> 01:14:41.306
- Full as a pub on New Year.
- Yeah, we have to get down to business.

01:14:46.298 --> 01:14:47.368
Force, Carolina!

01:14:47.369 --> 01:14:49.321
Hello. Hello.

01:14:50.122 --> 01:14:51.053
Hello.

01:14:51.054 --> 01:14:53.529
- Treasury.
- Oh.

01:14:59.042 --> 01:15:01.013
Peter, the bathroom is at the top of the stairs.

01:15:01.014 --> 01:15:03.894
Let me know if you need anything.
I will be here to take statements.

01:15:03.895 --> 01:15:04.911
Oh.

01:15:04.912 --> 01:15:05.912
Austin.

01:15:07.967 --> 01:15:10.852
Austin, we have to talk
about our relationship.

01:15:12.221 --> 01:15:14.093
- Yes.
- Ok? Good.

01:15:17.271 --> 01:15:20.727
- Bax, all right?
- Yes, it was only very hot.

01:15:22.906 --> 01:15:23.906
Ok.

01:15:26.195 --> 01:15:27.404
You sure you're okay?

01:15:27.405 --> 01:15:28.611
Yes, she is...

01:15:28.612 --> 01:15:30.090
Stretch something...

01:15:30.204 --> 01:15:31.257
Running.

01:15:34.269 --> 01:15:35.681
- Are you okay?
- Yes...

01:15:35.854 --> 01:15:36.888
I'm fine.

01:15:42.808 --> 01:15:45.227
Be right back.
I go for a moment to clean up.

01:15:46.909 --> 01:15:48.378
Okay, so...

01:15:48.891 --> 01:15:50.891
Who wants to start?

01:16:33.449 --> 01:16:35.705
I know it's been a
difficult day for all.

01:16:36.173 --> 01:16:39.401
- I can not imagine how much.
- Yeah. We passed by drinking a lot.

01:16:39.607 --> 01:16:41.573
Well, let's start from the beginning.

01:16:41.950 --> 01:16:43.310
Who found the body?

01:16:44.880 --> 01:16:45.943
I.

01:16:45.944 --> 01:16:48.245
- You?
- Yes, me.

01:16:48.892 --> 01:16:51.575
I arrived, and she was there.

01:16:51.946 --> 01:16:54.486
- Where?
- Life, in the tub.

01:16:54.798 --> 01:16:56.599
So you've found the body first?

01:16:56.600 --> 01:16:59.454
Actually, I found myself.

01:16:59.455 --> 01:17:02.418
I found it just before
Dallas because...

01:17:02.419 --> 01:17:05.128
I'm back and I had to go to
the bathroom, so I ran out...

01:17:05.129 --> 01:17:07.970
And I went to the bathroom and I saw...

01:17:08.619 --> 01:17:10.987
- Who had just died.
- Just dead?

01:17:12.849 --> 01:17:16.413
No, I do not think that
the right word. I...

01:17:18.187 --> 01:17:20.468
Ok, who's been the
last to see her alive?

01:17:20.469 --> 01:17:21.522
I was me.

01:17:22.448 --> 01:17:24.382
What time did you see him last?

01:17:24.383 --> 01:17:25.819
- Last night.
- This morning.

01:17:27.366 --> 01:17:28.740
Last night...

01:17:29.142 --> 01:17:31.435
And I found the body this morning.

01:17:31.436 --> 01:17:32.682
Wait a minute.

01:17:32.683 --> 01:17:35.328
No, Dallas said to have
found her this morning.

01:17:35.340 --> 01:17:38.273
No, it was me.
Remember? Because I had to go to the bathroom.

01:17:38.274 --> 01:17:40.337
She had to go to the bathroom.

01:17:56.672 --> 01:17:57.672
Okay.

01:17:57.919 --> 01:18:00.070
Wait.
What you say does not make sense, ok?

01:18:00.071 --> 01:18:02.400
I'll take you to the central
question you, and you...

01:18:02.401 --> 01:18:04.063
Individually, if necessary.

01:18:04.064 --> 01:18:07.039
I need a timeline of events...
rational.

01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:10.246
- No, that's what we're trying to give you.
- "Just dead," Baltimore?

01:18:10.247 --> 01:18:12.671
- What does it mean?
- I did not mean "just"...

01:18:13.241 --> 01:18:14.241
Carolina...

01:18:14.795 --> 01:18:17.546
You can help me out?
I just want to know what happened.

01:18:17.547 --> 01:18:19.476
They are giving conflicting versions.

01:18:22.676 --> 01:18:24.507
Barton, our mother was sick.

01:18:25.191 --> 01:18:26.901
He had ALS.

01:18:29.414 --> 01:18:33.149
She killed herself because she was trapped
in a body of which he had no control.

01:18:33.150 --> 01:18:34.404
She suffered...

01:18:34.690 --> 01:18:35.880
All the time.

01:18:36.124 --> 01:18:37.980
He knew he could only worsen.

01:18:39.343 --> 01:18:40.544
I did not know.

01:18:40.545 --> 01:18:42.186
He did not want knew anyone.

01:18:51.439 --> 01:18:53.083
Barton, knew our mother.

01:18:53.607 --> 01:18:55.306
It was a dignified woman.

01:18:56.021 --> 01:19:00.671
She did not want others displeased her.
He wanted a dead calm.

01:19:04.371 --> 01:19:06.910
I think these are for you.

01:19:07.950 --> 01:19:09.686
She left letters.

01:19:10.588 --> 01:19:13.844
No signs of struggle.
It is definitely taken her own life.

01:19:16.053 --> 01:19:18.009
I'm so sorry for your loss.

01:19:19.910 --> 01:19:20.910
Barton.

01:19:23.368 --> 01:19:24.368
Thanks.

01:19:28.331 --> 01:19:29.919
You can take the body now.

01:20:24.350 --> 01:20:26.187
