TO THE COMIC BOOK CONVENTION.

00:05.600 --> 00:07.431

SAVING THE WORLD

00:07.470 --> 00:11.304
BEFORE THE STREETLIGHTS
COME ON.

00:11.340 --> 00:13.308
- WHERE'S YOUR COSTUME?

00:13.340 --> 00:16.047
- I'M WEARING IT.
I'M TAP-MAN.

00:16.080 --> 00:18.640
TAP-DANCING SUPERHERO--
YUCK.

00:18.680 --> 00:20.648
- HOW IS IT THAT YOU ALWAYS MAKE
THE WRONG CHOICE

00:20.680 --> 00:22.216
BETWEEN COOL AND STUPID?

00:22.250 --> 00:24.218
- HEY, HEY, SHAWN,
GIVE GUSTER A CHANCE

00:24.250 --> 00:25.740
TO PRESENT HIS CASE
FOR TAP-MAN.

00:25.790 --> 00:28.486
- TAP-MAN MEETS
ALL THE SUPERHERO REQUIREMENTS.

- WOW, THAT IS STUPID.

00:38.530 --> 00:41.363
- YEAH. AND PLUS,
HOW DOES HE FIGHT?

00:41.400 --> 00:44.836
- WELL, HE CONFUSES THE BAD GUYS
WITH HIS QUICK SYNCOPATION

00:44.870 --> 00:48.078
AND GRABS SOME TAP SAND
FROM HIS TRUSTY POUCH,

00:48.110 --> 00:50.647
AND SPLAT!
RIGHT IN THE EYES.

00:50.680 --> 00:53.649
- COME ON, LET'S GO.
WE'RE ALREADY LATE.

00:53.680 --> 00:55.375
- TO THE TAP-MOBILE!

00:55.420 --> 00:57.388
- ARE YOU SURE NO ONE CAN TELL
MY TRUE IDENTITY UNDER THIS?

00:57.420 --> 00:59.388
- FOR YOUR SAKE,
LET'S HOPE SO.

- THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT,
SHAWN!

01:12.540 --> 01:13.734
- YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT BLEW OUR COVER!

01:13.770 --> 01:15.761
- NO ONE TOLD YOU TO OPEN A
CAR DOOR AND SET OFF THE ALARM!

01:15.800 --> 01:17.700
- WHY WAS THE ALARM ON?
WE WERE STILL INSIDE THE CAR!

01:17.740 --> 01:19.674
- INSIDE THE CAR, NOT GETTING
CARJACKED AND BRUTALIZED,

01:19.710 --> 01:21.598
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
- JUST HURRY UP.

01:21.640 --> 01:23.176
IF WE CATCH THESE GUYS,
WE'RE HEROES.

01:23.210 --> 01:26.611
- NO, IF WE CATCH THESE GUYS,
WE'LL BE DEAD. AAH!

01:30.220 --> 01:32.450
- YOU THINK WE LOST 'EM?

01:32.490 --> 01:35.186

YOU TRIPPED ME.

01:42.430 --> 01:43.692

I LET YOU USE

01:56.410 --> 01:58.378
YOUR FAST-TWITCH MUSCLES
AS AN EXCUSE FOR ANYTHING.

01:58.410 --> 02:00.310

THAT'S NOT TRUE.

02:00.350 --> 02:03.342
- DAMN IT. [groaning]
I'M GONNA GO CATCH THOSE GUYS.

02:03.390 --> 02:05.381

02:13.900 --> 02:16.767
- LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY GOT
TO THESE GUYS BEFORE WE DID.

02:29.680 --> 02:31.272
- "THE MANTIS."

02:35.450 --> 02:37.418
- A LITTLE THICKER
ON THE EYEBROWS.

02:37.450 --> 02:39.611
- ARE YOU SURE?
- LET'S SEE HIM.

02:39.660 --> 02:42.959

02:42.990 --> 02:44.958
AND, UH, YOU SHOULD ADD
ANOTHER WHEEL.

02:44.990 --> 02:47.299
IT'LL IMPLY MORE MOTION.
- DUDE, IN YOUR DREAMS.

02:47.330 --> 02:49.423
- YOU'RE RIGHT. I CAN'T
SKATEBOARD THAT WELL.

02:49.470 --> 02:51.324
- WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?
- HE'S TOO CHEAP

02:51.370 --> 02:53.463
TO PAY THE CARICATURE ARTIST
AT THE PIER $30,

02:53.500 --> 02:55.229
SO WE DECIDED TO GET ONE
THIS WAY.

02:55.270 --> 02:57.636
- THAT'LL BE ALL.
YOU ARE DONE WASTING OUR TIME.

02:57.670 --> 02:59.376
- I'LL SAY WHEN I'M DONE.

02:59.410 --> 03:01.799
ALL RIGHT, I'M DONE
WASTING EVERYONE'S TIME.

ALL RIGHT, WHICH ONE OF YOU
LOWLIFES WANT TO DESCRIBE

03:17.590 --> 03:19.797
THE GUY THAT DID THIS TO YOU?

03:19.830 --> 03:24.221
- HE WAS WELL-BUILT,
ABOUT 6 FEET TALL, 200 POUNDS.

03:24.270 --> 03:25.692
- HE CAME OUT OF NOWHERE.

03:25.730 --> 03:27.698
BEFORE WE REALIZED
WHAT HAPPENED, HE WAS GONE.

03:27.740 --> 03:30.436
- DID HE HAVE ON A BODY SUIT
AND HAVE INTENSE EYES

03:30.470 --> 03:33.303
SHINING THROUGH A DARK MASK?
- YOU SAW HIM, TOO, GUSTER?

03:33.340 --> 03:36.571

I'M TELLING YOU, I'LL NEVER BUY

YOU TRIPPED.
- NO, I DID NOT.

04:52.560 --> 04:54.881
- YOU TRIPPED.
- NO, I DID NOT, SHAWN.

04:54.920 --> 04:56.478
- CHIEF VICK, IS IT TRUE

04:56.530 --> 04:58.350
THAT THE FOUR CRIMINALS
THE VIGILANTE CAUGHT

04:58.390 --> 05:00.028
ARE MEMBERS OF
THE CAMINO DRUG SYNDICATE?

05:00.060 --> 05:01.891

HERE LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW

05:01.930 --> 05:03.761
I'M NOT ANSWERING THAT.
- ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT!

05:03.800 --> 05:06.633
LAST THING WE NEED IS A BUNCH
OF REPORTERS TWISTING OUR WORDS,

05:06.670 --> 05:08.558
ESPECIALLY YOU COPY MONKEYS
AT THE MIRROR.

05:08.600 --> 05:09.965
DON'T THINK I'VE FORGOTTEN

05:10.010 --> 05:11.659
ABOUT THE WHOLE
"DETECT IVE DIPSTICK" INCIDENT.

05:11.710 --> 05:13.701

BY CHAD GORSUCH,

05:13.740 --> 05:15.571

IN SOUTH AMERICA.

05:15.610 --> 05:17.407
- WELL, AT LEAST
HE'S BEING PUNISHED.

05:17.450 --> 05:19.077
- CHIEF, CAN YOU GIVE US
ANY INFORMATION?

05:19.110 --> 05:20.941
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US?
- HAVE THE CAMINOS

05:20.980 --> 05:22.811
REALLY TAKEN CONTROL
OF ALL COCAINE PRODUCTION

- SHOULD OTHER CITIZENS
FOLLOW HIS LEAD?

05:28.120 --> 05:30.429
- OKAY, THAT I'LL COMMENT ON.

05:30.460 --> 05:32.428
VIGILANTISM
IS A DANGEROUS ACT.

05:32.460 --> 05:34.428
THE ART OF APPREHENDING
CRIMINALS SHOULD BE LEFT

05:34.460 --> 05:35.950
TO THE POLICE OFFICERS

05:36.000 --> 05:37.968
WHO HAVE BEEN ADEQUATELY TRAINED
AND EQUIPPED.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.968

05:40.000 --> 05:41.797
SAY THAT THE POLICE CONSULTANT
FAILED TO APPREHEND

05:41.840 --> 05:45.765
THE FOUR SUSPECTS BECAUSE HE WAS
"WOEFULLY OUT OF SHAPE"?

BY MY CLUMSY ASSISTANT

LISTEN UP.

06:08.460 --> 06:10.428
I WOULD BE LYING IF I SAID

06:10.470 --> 06:13.439
THIS VIGILANTE HASN'T MADE US
LOOK BAD IN RECENT DAYS.

06:13.470 --> 06:15.836
I'D ALSO BE LYING IF I SAID
I DIDN'T SOMETIMES WISH

06:15.870 --> 06:17.838
THAT I COULD OPERATE OUTSIDE
THE CONSTRAINTS OF THE BADGE

06:17.870 --> 06:20.430
AND DISH OUT SOME GOOD
OLD-FASHIONED STREET JUSTICE

06:20.480 --> 06:22.448
OF MY OWN.
- BUT WE CAN'T.

06:22.480 --> 06:23.970
- [scoffs]
APPARENTLY NOT EVEN WHILE

06:24.010 --> 06:25.443
TRAVELING ALONG THE BORDER.

06:25.480 --> 06:27.641
- NOT EVEN.

06:27.680 --> 06:31.047

OLD-FASHIONED POLICE WORK.

ARE LOCATIONS

OR THE MANTIS,

06:38.660 --> 06:40.594
AS HE'S AFFECT IONATELY KNOWN
TO THE PUBLIC--

06:40.630 --> 06:42.996
APPREHENDED MEMBERS
OF THE CAMINO DRUG SYNDICATE.

06:43.030 --> 06:46.124
- "AFFECTIONATELY KNOWN"?
- WE HAVE ALSO LISTED THE DATES.

06:46.170 --> 06:50.129
IN EACH SITUATION, A MAJOR
DRUG EXCHANGE WAS IN PROGRESS.

06:50.170 --> 06:52.058
THIS IS A WELL-FUNDED

06:52.110 --> 06:54.931
AND EXTREMELY
WELL-ORGANIZED OPERATION.

06:54.980 --> 06:56.948
WE HAVE LOCATED A HANDFUL
OF THE PHONY BUSINESSES

06:56.980 --> 07:00.074
THAT THEY ARE USING AS FRONTS,
BUT THERE COULD BE A DOZEN MORE.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.543
- NOW WE WERE JUST NOTIFIED
OF THIS MOST RECENT BUST

07:02.590 --> 07:05.684
20 MINUTES AGO BY OUR COLLEAGUES
ON THE VENTURA POLICE FORCE.

07:05.720 --> 07:07.688

COMBINED WITH THE OTHERS

07:07.720 --> 07:09.950
THAT THE MANTIS
HAS IMPRESSIVELY HANDLED,

07:09.990 --> 07:12.550
GIVES US EIGHT OF
THE CAMINO SYNDICATE MEMBERS.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.556
LET'S GET OUT THERE
AND FIND THE REST.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.898
- YOU HEARD HER.
GO DO IT.

07:19.640 --> 07:21.767
- SOUNDS LIKE YOU WANT TO GIVE
THIS WEIRDO SOME KIND OF MEDAL.

07:21.800 --> 07:24.633
- SHAWN, OFTENTIMES,
VIGILANTES ARE JUST GOOD PEOPLE

07:24.670 --> 07:26.501
WHO WANT TO TAKE BACK
THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD

07:26.540 --> 07:28.030
FROM A BAD ELEMENT.
- SURE.

07:28.080 --> 07:29.775

A REAL CHARMER.

07:29.810 --> 07:31.175
EASTWOOD IN GRAN TORINO--

07:31.210 --> 07:32.677
THERE'S A GUY YOU WANT
TO HOP IN THE TUB WITH.

07:32.720 --> 07:34.745
- OKAY, THE MANTIS
IS A BIT ECCENTRIC,

07:34.780 --> 07:36.179
AND I WOULDN'T GO AS FAR
AS TO SAY

07:36.220 --> 07:38.017
THAT I SUPPORT WHAT HE'S DOING,
BUT YOU HAVE TO ADMIT,

07:38.050 --> 07:39.654
HE'S DONE A BETTER JOB
THAN WE HAVE

07:39.690 --> 07:40.918
OF SLOWING DOWN THE CAMINOS,
AND HE'S JUST ONE GUY.

07:40.960 --> 07:43.884
- I'M JUST ONE GUY. I'VE SOLVED
MORE CRIMES THAN I CAN COUNT.

07:43.930 --> 07:45.625
BECAUSE I'VE SOLVED
A LOT OF CRIMES,

07:45.660 --> 07:47.252
NOT JUST BECAUSE I CAN'T
COUNT VERY HIGH.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.860
- YES, BUT YOU HAVE
A SUPERNATURAL PSYCHIC GIFT.

07:49.900 --> 07:52.266
THE MANTIS IS SOLVING CRIMES
USING HIS NATURAL INSTINCTS

07:52.300 --> 07:54.791
AND SHARPLY HONED ABILITIES.
- SHE'S RIGHT, SHAWN.

07:54.840 --> 07:56.865
I MEAN, IF YOU WERE A REGULAR
GUY SOLVING THESE CRIMES,

07:56.910 --> 07:58.263
THAT'D REALLY BE IMPRESSIVE.

07:58.310 --> 08:00.130
BUT EVERYONE KNOWS
THAT YOU'RE A PSYCHIC.

08:00.180 --> 08:03.047
I MEAN, THAT'S REALLY
AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE.

08:03.080 --> 08:06.971
- [chuckles]
I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT, GUS.

08:09.020 --> 08:11.238
- THANKS A LOT,
BENEDICT ARNOLD JACKSON.

08:11.290 --> 08:12.985
- I KNOW WHAT THIS IS ABOUT.

08:13.020 --> 08:14.715
YOU'RE JEALOUS
OF ALL THE ATTENTION

08:14.760 --> 08:16.625
THAT THE MANTIS IS GETTING,
ESPECIALLY FROM JULIET.

08:16.660 --> 08:18.628
- [scoffs] PLEASE.
YOU THINK I CARE IF JULIET GIVES

08:18.660 --> 08:19.729
ANOTHER GUY
A LITTLE ATTENTION?

08:19.760 --> 08:21.990
HOW INSECURE
DO YOU THINK I AM?

08:22.030 --> 08:23.691
SERIOUSLY, HOW INSECURE
DO YOU THINK I AM?

08:23.730 --> 08:24.958
I NEED YOU TO TELL ME.
WILL YOU PLEASE TELL ME?

08:25.000 --> 08:26.592
- WHY ARE YOU BOTHERED
BY THIS GUY?

08:26.640 --> 08:28.767
- BECAUSE, GUS, THERE'S ALREADY
A BADASS CRIME FIGHTER

08:28.800 --> 08:30.768
IN A COOL OUTFIT
RUNNING AROUND THIS TOWN,

08:30.810 --> 08:33.574
AND HIS NAME IS ME.

08:33.610 --> 08:34.975
THE MANTIS CAN'T EVEN FLY

08:35.010 --> 08:36.705
OR ACTIVATE INTO HALF
OF SOMETHING

08:36.750 --> 08:38.240
YOU JUST HAPPEN TO NEED
IN THE MOMENT.

08:38.280 --> 08:40.111
- HE'S CLEARLY EMULATING
THE "EVERYMAN" SUPERHEROES

08:40.150 --> 08:41.970
LIKE BATMAN AND IRON MAN.

08:42.020 --> 08:43.715
BESIDES, YOU SHOULDN'T
CRITICIZE THE GUY

08:43.750 --> 08:45.240
WITHOUT KNOWING
HIS ORIGIN STORY.

08:45.290 --> 08:47.087
- THE MANTIS IS NOT
A REAL SUPERHERO, GUS.

08:47.120 --> 08:49.725
HE'S JUST SOME NUT IN A MASK.

08:49.760 --> 08:53.594
[eerie music]

09:03.240 --> 09:05.936
- HEY, WHAT'S THAT CALENDAR
YOU HAVE ON YOUR DESK,

09:05.970 --> 09:08.074
THE--THE ONE THAT'S ALL LOONY?
- YOU MEAN LUNAR?

09:08.110 --> 09:10.078
IT TRACKS THE PHASES
OF THE MOON.

09:10.110 --> 09:12.078
- WHAT'S THE NEXT PHASE?
- NEW MOON.

09:12.110 --> 09:14.078
IT'S COMING SOON, THE 26th.

09:14.120 --> 09:16.816
- THE 26th. EVERYONE STOP
WHAT YOU'RE DOING

09:16.850 --> 09:18.613
AND ONLY PAY ATTENTION TO ME!

09:18.650 --> 09:21.312
I'M GETTING
A CLEAR PSYCHIC VISION

09:21.360 --> 09:22.918
ON WHEN THE NEXT
CAMINO DRUG EXCHANGE

09:22.960 --> 09:26.282
WILL TAKE PLACE.

09:26.330 --> 09:28.252
SEPTEMBER 26th.

09:28.300 --> 09:30.598
- [whispering]
IT'S OCTOBER.

09:30.630 --> 09:32.598
- [whispering] THAT MEANS
IT'S ALMOST, LIKE, A YEAR AWAY.

09:32.640 --> 09:34.596
- OCTOBER OF THIS YEAR, SHAWN.
- [normal voice] OCTOBER 26th,

09:34.640 --> 09:36.767
BECAUSE THIS IS
THE MONTH OF OCTOBER.

09:36.810 --> 09:38.766
- SPENCER, YOU'RE NOT EVEN
OFFICIALLY ON THIS CASE.

09:38.810 --> 09:40.300
YOU KNOW THE ROUTINE.
FIRST YOU--

09:40.340 --> 09:42.035
- DAD, CAN I PLEASE--
- YOU'RE HIRED.

09:42.080 --> 09:44.298
- WELL, THERE IT IS.
- FINE.

09:44.350 --> 09:45.874
WE'LL LOOK INTO IT.

09:45.910 --> 09:47.912
HAVE VICE MONITOR
ANY LOCAL STREET CHATTER

09:47.950 --> 09:50.043
FOR ANYTHING GOING DOWN
ON THE 26th,

09:50.090 --> 09:51.318
ESPECIALLY ANY LARGE
INDUSTRIAL SHIPMENTS

09:51.350 --> 09:53.056
OCCURRING AFTER HOURS.

09:53.090 --> 09:56.253
NOBODY BREATHE A WORD OF THIS
TO ANYBODY OUTSIDE THE FORCE.

09:56.290 --> 09:59.123
- HOW'S THAT FOR ONE MAN?

09:59.160 --> 10:00.991
NO, SERIOUSLY,
H-HOW WAS THAT FOR ONE MAN?

10:01.030 --> 10:02.998
I NEED YOU TO TELL ME.
- IT WAS ALL RIGHT.

10:03.030 --> 10:05.863
- IT'S ON, MANTIS.
- I'M NOT THE MANTIS, SHAWN.

10:05.900 --> 10:07.265
- YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT,
YOU'RE NOT.

10:07.300 --> 10:09.131
YOU COULD NEVER BE
THE MANTIS.

10:09.170 --> 10:11.206
- YOU HAVE PROBLEMS.

10:11.240 --> 10:13.208
- ATTENTION, ALL UNITS,
WE HAVE A POSITIVE

10:13.240 --> 10:16.209
ON SUSPECT ED CAMINO ACTIVITY
AT THE PIER FOUR SHIPPING DOCKS.

10:16.240 --> 10:18.242
ALL UNITS RESPOND.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.382
- REALLY? AGAIN?

10:28.420 --> 10:31.082
- THE MANTIS TOOK OUT FOUR PERPS
SINGLE-HANDEDLY.

10:31.130 --> 10:33.826
- AGAIN WITHOUT A GUN
OR NEEDLESS BLOODSHED.

10:33.860 --> 10:35.953
THAT IS CLASSIC SUPERHERO
MORAL CODE.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.968
- WHOEVER HE IS,
I'M GLAD HE'S ON OUR SIDE.

10:40.870 --> 10:42.428
- SHE USED TO TALK ABOUT YOU
THAT WAY.

10:42.470 --> 10:45.268
- WOULD YOU STOP IT?

10:45.310 --> 10:47.904
WHOEVER THE MANTIS IS, HE'S NOT
DOING THIS BY HIMSELF, GUS.

10:47.940 --> 10:49.908
HE CLEARLY HAS AN INSIDE ANGLE,

10:49.950 --> 10:52.202
WHICH MEANS HE EITHER OVERHEARD
MY PSYCHIC REVELATION

10:52.250 --> 10:54.810
OR HE GOT AHOLD OF
THE INFORMATION THE COPS HAVE.

10:54.850 --> 10:56.408
- HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

10:56.450 --> 10:59.214
- NOBODY BREATHE A WORD OF THIS
TO ANYBODY OUTSIDE THE FORCE.

10:59.250 --> 11:01.753
- IT ISN'T,

11:01.790 --> 11:05.282
UNLESS HE'S ALREADY
ON THE...INSIDE

11:05.330 --> 11:08.094
OF THE POLICE DEPARTMENT.

11:08.130 --> 11:10.098
- WHOEVER THIS BROTHER IS,
HE'S GONNA BE HARD TO SPOT.

11:10.130 --> 11:11.825
- YOU CAN'T JUST ASSUME
HE'S A BROTHER

11:11.870 --> 11:13.337
BECAUSE HE'S ALL MYSTERIOUS
AND SMOOTH.

11:13.370 --> 11:15.463
- YOU'LL SEE, HE'S EITHER
A BROTHER OR PERSIAN.

11:15.500 --> 11:17.707
- I CAN'T TALK TO YOU
WHEN YOU'RE LIKE THIS.

11:17.740 --> 11:20.379
- OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT. [sighs]

11:20.410 --> 11:22.742
WE KNOW IT'S NOT LASSIE,
BECAUSE HE'S WAY TOO PROUD

11:22.780 --> 11:25.943
TO SOLVE CRIMES ANONYMOUSLY.
- [slamming keyboard]

11:30.450 --> 11:32.850
- AND IT'S NOT 1976.

11:32.890 --> 11:36.189
- [humming theme from Jaws]

11:38.430 --> 11:39.852
both: NO.

11:39.900 --> 11:42.892
- WHO'S THE NEW GUY?
- I DON'T KNOW,

11:42.930 --> 11:44.761
BUT HE IS THE RIGHT HEIGHT
AND WEIGHT.

11:44.800 --> 11:47.496
- AND HE WAS HERE
WHEN I REVEALED MY INSIDE TIP.

11:47.540 --> 11:50.304
HEY, THERE.

11:50.340 --> 11:53.776
WE'VE NEVER MET OFFICIALLY.
THIS IS GUS. I'M SHAWN.

11:53.810 --> 11:55.175
- SCOTT REYNOLDS,

11:55.210 --> 11:56.905
JUST TRANSFERRED OVER
FROM VENTURA P.D.

11:56.950 --> 11:58.770
- WE WERE JUST NOTIFIED
OF THIS MOST RECENT BUST

11:58.810 --> 12:01.313
20 MINUTES AGO BY OUR COLLEAGUES
ON THE VENTURA POLICE FORCE.

12:01.350 --> 12:03.318
- THAT'S QUITE A GRIP
YOU HAVE THERE, SCOTT.

12:03.350 --> 12:05.910
YOU MUST WORK OUT.
- A LITTLE.

12:05.950 --> 12:07.986
- OH, COME ON NOW.

12:08.020 --> 12:09.453
FEELS LIKE
MORE THAN JUST A LITTLE.

12:09.490 --> 12:10.787
DOESN'T IT, GUS?
- SHAWN...

12:10.830 --> 12:11.888
- FEEL IT.
- I DON'T WANT TO FEEL IT.

12:11.930 --> 12:13.249
- FEEL THE MAN'S FITNESS LEVEL.
- I'M NOT FEELING--

12:13.300 --> 12:14.995
- DO IT.
- FINE.

12:15.030 --> 12:17.794
OH, YOU ARE KIND OF FIT.
- UH-HUH.

12:17.830 --> 12:19.468
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU COULD
HANDLE YOURSELF

12:19.500 --> 12:21.764
IN A DARK ALLEY FULL OF GUYS.

12:21.800 --> 12:24.200
- I SUPPOSE IF I HAD TO.

12:24.240 --> 12:27.471
- UH-HUH. I BET YOU'RE REAL NICE
WITH THE HAND-TO-HAND ACTION.

12:27.510 --> 12:30.206
- OKAY. DUDE,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

12:30.250 --> 12:32.206
GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT.
- WATCH AND LEARN, GUS.

12:32.250 --> 12:35.344
THIS IS--IT'S LIKE A DANCE.
- I KNOW HOW TO DANCE, SHAWN.

12:35.380 --> 12:38.816
- UH, GUYS, EXCUSE ME,
I'VE GOT SOME WORK TO DO.

12:38.850 --> 12:42.479
- YEAH, NO PROBLEM. WE'LL CATCH
YOU LATER, DR. MUSCLES.

12:42.520 --> 12:44.954
IT'S DEFINITELY HIM.
- SO WHAT DO WE DO NEXT?

12:44.990 --> 12:46.548
- I SHOULD PROBABLY GO
THROW SOME LUNCHMEAT

12:46.590 --> 12:47.898
AT THE GUYS IN THE DRUNK TANK.

12:47.930 --> 12:49.090
- AFTER WE PROVE
THAT HE'S THE MANTIS.

12:49.130 --> 12:52.065
- NO, WE DO THAT FIRST.

12:52.100 --> 12:54.068
- WHICH THEY ALL ATE

12:54.100 --> 12:57.399
USING THE SAME FORK.

12:57.440 --> 12:59.135
SHAWN, YOU'RE NOT
EVEN LISTENING.

12:59.170 --> 13:01.968
- I AM. IAM. MM-HMM. WHY?
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

13:02.010 --> 13:04.979
- I JUST GAVE YOU A SETUP
CONTAINING MR. T.,

13:05.010 --> 13:06.841
CROCKETT, AND A WORD
THAT RHYMES WITH "MORK"

13:06.880 --> 13:09.246
AND I GOT NOTHIN'...
- [chuckles] MORK.

13:09.280 --> 13:11.111
- NOT EVEN A "BATTLE
OF THE NETWORK STARS" JOKE.

13:11.150 --> 13:13.118
- [chuckles]
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

13:13.160 --> 13:15.116
- [clears throat]
ALL RIGHT, UH--

13:15.160 --> 13:17.128
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN,
I-I NEED TO SAY THIS.

13:17.160 --> 13:20.527
WITH REGARDS TO THE MANTIS...
- OH, OKAY.

13:20.560 --> 13:22.448
UM, YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET'S JUST--

13:22.500 --> 13:24.525
LET'S JUST
FINISH OUR DINNER

13:24.570 --> 13:27.494
AND NOT TALK ABOUT WORK
OR THE MANTIS.

13:27.540 --> 13:29.098
- WH-WHY--WHY NOT?

13:29.140 --> 13:30.960
- WELL, I JUST THINK

13:31.010 --> 13:32.978
THAT WE CLEARLY HAVE
DIFFERENT OPINIONS ABOUT IT.

13:33.010 --> 13:34.329
- [scoffs]
CLEARLY.

13:34.380 --> 13:37.599
- AND I DON'T WANT IT TO BE
AN ISSUE BETWEEN US

13:37.650 --> 13:39.447
IF WE DON'T SEE EYE-TO-EYE
ON A CASE

13:39.480 --> 13:41.971
OR A SUSPECT OR WHATEVER.

13:42.020 --> 13:43.988
- HOW WOULD THAT POSSIBLY
BE AN ISSUE?

13:44.020 --> 13:46.113
I MEAN, GUS AND I NEVER SEE
EYE-TO-EYE ON WORK STUFF.

13:46.150 --> 13:47.981
FOR INSTANCE, HE DOESN'T LIKE
BEING USED AS A HUMAN SHIELD

13:48.020 --> 13:49.510
WHEN WE'RE BEING SHOT AT.

13:49.560 --> 13:51.448
I HAPPEN TO THINK
IT'S A VERY NOBLE WAY

13:51.490 --> 13:53.458
TO MEET ONE'S MAKER,
ESPECIALLY FOR A GUY LIKE HIM.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.320
BOTTOM LINE IS WE NEVER LET
THAT DIFFERENCE OF OPINION

13:55.360 --> 13:56.588
INTERFERE WITH ANYTHING.

13:56.630 --> 13:58.461
- OKAY, WELL,
AS LONG AS YOU KNOW

13:58.500 --> 14:00.058
THAT IT'S NOT A COMPETITION.

14:00.100 --> 14:02.466
- I KNOW THAT.
LOOK, LET'S JUST--

14:02.500 --> 14:04.468
LET'S JUST HAVE A NICE DINNER,

14:04.510 --> 14:07.206
SEE WHO CAN E_AT THE FASTEST...
- [glggleSJ

14:07.240 --> 14:09.504
- AND, UH, NOT TALK
ABOUT WORK.

14:09.540 --> 14:12.202
- GREAT.
[cell phone buzzing]

14:14.250 --> 14:16.616
[eerie music]

14:20.990 --> 14:22.412
- WHAT'S UP?

14:22.460 --> 14:26.180
- OH, UM, IT'S NOTHING.
IT'S, UH...

14:26.230 --> 14:28.448
JUST A WORK THING.
- YOU NEED TO GO.

14:28.500 --> 14:30.468
- NO. NO, NO, NO. THEY SEND
THE MESSAGE OUT TO EVERYBODY,

14:30.500 --> 14:32.320
AND THEY KNOW
THAT I'M OFF DUTY.

14:32.370 --> 14:35.089
- YOU WANT TO GO, DON'T YOU?
- WELL...

14:35.140 --> 14:38.200
- IT'S OKAY, JULES. YOU CAN GO,
AND YOU SHOULD GO. GO.

14:38.240 --> 14:41.209
YOU CAN GO.
- REALLY?

14:41.240 --> 14:42.468
- YES.
- OKAY.

14:42.510 --> 14:44.205
- I'LL CALL YOU LATER.
- YEP.

14:44.250 --> 14:46.946
- OKAY. MWAH.

14:46.980 --> 14:48.516
[whispering]
HEY, EXCUSE ME.

14:48.550 --> 14:50.347
[normal voice]
COULD I GET A CHECK

14:50.390 --> 14:51.516
AS SOON AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE?
THANK YOU.

14:51.550 --> 14:54.519
- CONFIRM MULTIPLE UNITS
EN ROUTE TO REPORTED ACTIVITY

14:54.560 --> 14:55.618
AT 1215 MARINE WAY.

14:55.660 --> 14:58.652
POTENTIALLY ARMED SUSPECT S.
PROCEED WITH CAUTION.

14:58.690 --> 15:01.898
[alarm blaring]

15:06.530 --> 15:10.000
- HE'S BEEN HERE AGAIN.

15:10.040 --> 15:14.704
[alarm continues blaring]

15:14.740 --> 15:17.470
- IT'S THE MANTIS.

15:22.480 --> 15:35.291
[dramatic music]

15:35.330 --> 15:37.298
[indistinct conversation]
- MAKE WAY, MAKE WAY.

15:37.330 --> 15:39.298
- DID THE POLICE I.D.
THE LAST CULPRIT?

15:39.330 --> 15:41.059
- CAN YOU CONFIRM
OR DENY REPORTS

15:41.100 --> 15:43.136
THAT THE MANTIS
HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED?

15:43.170 --> 15:46.970
- WAS THE MANTIS INJURED, SIR?
[voices overlapping]

15:47.010 --> 15:50.104
- YOU CAUSED QUITE A STIR.
IT'S A MADHOUSE OUT THERE.

15:50.150 --> 15:52.106
- OH, THANKS, BUZZ.
I-I THINK I'M SAFE NOW.

15:52.150 --> 15:53.549
[chuckles]

15:56.280 --> 15:58.009
- DO YOU EXPECT ANYONE
TO BELIEVE

15:58.050 --> 16:00.257
THAT YOU WERE ACTUALLY
THE MANTIS THIS ENTIRE TIME?

16:00.290 --> 16:02.110
- PLEASE, OF COURSE
I'M NOT THE MANTIS.

16:02.160 --> 16:03.980
WHAT HAVE WE BEEN DOING?
WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO EXPOSE HIM.

16:04.030 --> 16:05.986
- WELL, HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN
BEING DRESSED AS HIM?

16:06.030 --> 16:08.123
BECAUSE FROM THE LOOKS OF IT,
YOU'RE A COPYCAT VIGILANTE.

16:08.160 --> 16:09.696
MAYBE YOU SECRETLY
LOOK UP TO THIS GUY.

16:09.730 --> 16:12.426
- LOOK... [sighs] I REALIZED
THAT THE CAMINO SYNDICATE

16:12.470 --> 16:14.688
WAS GATHERING IN ONE
OF THE BAINE INDUSTRY BUILDINGS.

16:14.740 --> 16:16.560
I THOUGHT I COULD
FINALLY EXPOSE HIS IDENTITY

16:16.600 --> 16:19.501
BY GETTING TO THE BAD GUYS FIRST
AND CATCHING HIM IN THE ACT.

16:19.540 --> 16:20.677
[alarm blaring]

16:20.710 --> 16:21.574
AND JUST AS I THOUGHT,

16:21.610 --> 16:23.498
HE HAD THE SAME
INSIDE INFORMATION I DID

16:23.550 --> 16:26.110
AND WAS ALREADY THERE.

16:26.150 --> 16:28.118
YOU HEAR THAT?
IT LOOKS LIKE YOUR GAME'S UP.

16:28.150 --> 16:31.540
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIND OUT
WHO YOU REALLY ARE.

16:31.590 --> 16:34.218
FIRST, I USED A CLASSIC
COMBAT DISTRACT ION MOVE.

16:34.260 --> 16:36.478
- YOU WENT BONELESS,
DIDN'T YOU?

16:36.520 --> 16:38.488
- I USED MY ENTIRE BODY
AS A WEAPON.

16:38.530 --> 16:40.225
[grunting]

16:40.260 --> 16:43.297
AFTER AN EPIC,
VERY EVENLY MATCHED FIGHT,

16:43.330 --> 16:45.218
- [screaming]

16:45.270 --> 16:47.636
- HE SUCKER-PUNCHED ME.

16:47.670 --> 16:49.638
I WOKE UP WITH
THE FIRE ALARM BLARING,

16:49.670 --> 16:52.230
WEARING THAT RIDICULOUS
PAINTED-ON COSTUME,

16:52.270 --> 16:55.376
WHICH MEANS HE SAW ME
IN MY UNDERWEAR.

16:55.410 --> 16:57.105
- YOU MEAN LIKE
ON DIFF'RENT STROKES?

16:57.150 --> 16:58.640
- YES, GUS, JUST LIKE
DIFF'RENT STROKES.

16:58.680 --> 17:01.240
- THAT'S NOT COOL.
- NO, IT'S NOT, GUS.

17:01.280 --> 17:02.770
HE MUST HAVE PUT ON MY CLOTHES

17:02.820 --> 17:04.583
AND BLENDED IN WITH THE CROWD
LEAVING THE FIRST FLOOR.

17:04.620 --> 17:06.440
[pounds fist on table]
DAMN IT!

17:06.490 --> 17:08.458
I HAD A HANDFUL OF GUMMY WORMS
IN THAT JACKET

17:08.490 --> 17:10.082
THAT HE PROBABLY
WON'T EVEN EAT.

17:10.130 --> 17:11.483
- GET YOUR STORY STRAIGHT.

17:11.530 --> 17:14.226
EVERYBODY'S WAITING
TO HEAR WHAT HAPPENED.

17:14.260 --> 17:16.558
- YOU HAD EVERYBODY FOOLED THERE
FOR A SECOND.

17:16.600 --> 17:18.420
EVEN IF YOU WERE THE MANTIS,

17:18.470 --> 17:20.290
I WAS GONNA HAVE
TO BRING BACK TAP-MAN.

17:20.340 --> 17:22.160
- IT'S STILL THE STUPIDEST IDEA
FOR A SUPERHERO EVER.

17:22.200 --> 17:23.462
HOW DOES HE EVEN FIGHT?

17:23.510 --> 17:25.637
- SAND, SHAWN,
RIGHT IN THE EYES.

17:25.670 --> 17:28.571
YOU EVER HAD SAND
THROWN IN YOUR EYES, SHAWN?

17:28.610 --> 17:30.168
IT'S DEBILITATING.
- [sighS]

17:30.210 --> 17:32.178
- NO WONDER
YOU WERE ACTING SO WEIRD

17:32.210 --> 17:33.711
AT DINNER THE OTHER NIGHT.

17:33.750 --> 17:35.570
I MEAN, I KNEW YOU WERE CAPABLE
OF AMAZING THINGS,

17:35.620 --> 17:37.315
BUT THIS IS JUST--

17:37.350 --> 17:39.181
WOW.

17:39.220 --> 17:41.381
- WELL, THE CAT'S
OUT OF THE BAG NOW.

17:41.420 --> 17:43.354
- YOU GUYS GET IN HERE.

17:43.390 --> 17:45.529
THE REAL MANTIS WAS JUST SPOTTED
20 MINUTES AGO.

17:45.560 --> 17:48.324
- OH, WAS HE?

17:48.360 --> 17:51.295
- [scoffs] I KNOW YOU KNOW
I'M NOT TELLING THE TRUTH.

17:51.330 --> 17:54.128
I KNOW...
YOU KNOW.

17:56.470 --> 17:57.835
- ALL RIGHT, LISTEN,

17:57.870 --> 17:59.508
WE'RE IN A LOT OF HOT WATER
WITH THE MAYOR'S OFFICE

17:59.540 --> 18:01.132
FOR ALL THE FREE PRESS
WE'RE GIVING THIS GUY

18:01.180 --> 18:03.205
EVERY TIME HE SLIPS THROUGH
OUR GRASP, SO MAYBE YOU'D LIKE

18:03.250 --> 18:05.104
TO FILL US IN ON WHAT THE HELL
HAPPENED DOWN THERE.

18:05.150 --> 18:07.175
- THE REAL MANTIS JUMPED HIM
LIKE A SACK OF FLOUR,

18:07.220 --> 18:08.710
TOOK PICTURES OF HIM
IN HIS UNDERWEAR,

18:08.750 --> 18:10.308
THEN DRESSED IN HIS CLOTHES

18:10.350 --> 18:11.647
AND ESCAPED THROUGH THE CROWD
DOWNSTAIRS.

18:11.690 --> 18:14.454
- YOU DIDN'T EVEN GET
A GOOD LOOK AT HIM?

18:14.490 --> 18:16.754
GREAT. SO WE STILL DON'T KNOW
WHO THIS GUY IS.

18:16.790 --> 18:19.122
- BUT WE CAN ADD ONE MORE
BIG BUST TO HIS RECORD.

18:19.160 --> 18:20.821
THE PERP WE FOUND
KNOCKED OUT NEXT TO YOU

18:20.860 --> 18:22.521
WAS A LIEUTENANT
IN THE CAMINO SYNDICATE.

18:22.560 --> 18:24.528
WE PUT THE SCREWS TO HIM,
AND HE LET IT SLIP

18:24.570 --> 18:26.526
THAT THEY'RE MOVING
A HUGE SHIPMENT NEXT WEEKEND.

18:26.570 --> 18:28.663
- WHICH MEANS THIS IS
OUR LAST CHANCE TO STOP THEM

18:28.700 --> 18:30.702
BEFORE THEY FLOOD THE STREETS
WITH PRODUCT.

18:32.610 --> 18:34.874
- THE MANTIS KNOWS THAT
NOW, TOO.

18:34.910 --> 18:37.299
- WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT?

18:37.350 --> 18:39.910
- BECAUSE HE'S SOMEONE
IN THIS DEPARTMENT.

18:39.950 --> 18:43.841
- CAN YOU PROVE IT?
- GIVE ME ONE MINUTE.

18:43.890 --> 18:45.585
- CAN WE GET A COMMENT?

18:45.620 --> 18:47.588
- I DIDN'T HAVE
MY BEST STUFF TODAY.

18:47.620 --> 18:49.713
- MR. SPENCER, OVER HERE.
- ONE GAME AT A TIME.

18:49.760 --> 18:51.728
[voices overlapping]
- WE JUST GOTTA EXECUTE.

18:51.760 --> 18:53.728
HEY, HEY, HEY.

18:53.760 --> 18:57.321
OFFICER REYNOLDS,
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE,

18:57.370 --> 19:00.931
OR SHOULD I SAY, WHAT YOU ARE.
- EXCUSE ME?

19:00.970 --> 19:02.938
- COME ON, MAN, YOU CAN'T HIDE
YOUR IDENTITY FROM ME.

19:02.970 --> 19:05.530
IT'S TIME TO LET THE SECRET OUT.
- LISTEN, MAN,

19:05.570 --> 19:07.401
I'M SORRY I ACTED
ALL WEIRD EARLIER.

19:07.440 --> 19:09.203
I'M JUST NOT USED
TO GETTING HIT ON.

19:09.240 --> 19:11.879
- YOU'RE NOT--WHAT?

19:11.910 --> 19:15.311
- [sighS]
LOOK, I'M FLA'I'I'ERED,

19:15.350 --> 19:17.318
BUT I DON'T SHOOT THAT WAY.

19:17.350 --> 19:20.319
I CAN'T IMAGINE
HOW TOUGH IT MUST BE

19:20.360 --> 19:23.682
FOR YOU AROUND HERE,
BUT, LOOK,

19:23.730 --> 19:25.823
IT GETS BETTER.

19:25.860 --> 19:29.398
- OH, MY GOD, WHAT WOULD
MAKE YOU THINK THAT--

19:29.430 --> 19:31.318
YOU MUST WORK OUT.

19:31.370 --> 19:33.861
HANDLE YOURSELF IN
A DARK ALLEY FULL OF GUYS.

19:33.900 --> 19:36.334
BET YOU'RE NICE
WITH THE HAND-TO-HAND ACTION.

19:36.370 --> 19:39.203
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY, LOOK.

19:39.240 --> 19:42.209
LET'S BE VERY CLEAR HERE, OKAY?
I WAS NOT HITTING ON YOU.

19:42.240 --> 19:44.208
- IT'S OKAY, MAN.

19:44.250 --> 19:46.946
LOOK, I GOT THIS BUDDY, PETE,
THAT WOULD BE PERFECT FOR YOU.

19:46.980 --> 19:48.538
- STOP IT. I'M NOT--

19:48.580 --> 19:51.617
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOUR
SECRET IDENTITY, MAN--YOURS.

19:51.650 --> 19:53.618
YOU KNOW, BY DAY,
YOU'RE OFFICER REYNOLDS.

19:53.660 --> 19:55.878
BY NIGHT,
YOU'RE OFFICER MANTIS,

19:55.920 --> 19:59.458
OR SHOULD I SAY,
MANTIS REYNOLDS.

19:59.490 --> 20:01.526
- [grunting]

20:01.560 --> 20:03.596
- [groaning]

20:03.630 --> 20:05.769
- WHY THE LONG SLEEVES? HUH?

20:05.800 --> 20:07.358
YOU HIDING SOMETHING,

20:07.400 --> 20:09.493
LIKE MAYBE THE MARKS
FROM YOUR LAST FIGHT?

20:11.570 --> 20:14.733
- HUH. NO BITE MARKS,
NO SCRATCHES.

20:14.780 --> 20:17.340
AND YOU HAVE A TATTOO
OF A BULL MASTIFF.

20:17.380 --> 20:19.644
- THAT'S MY NANA.

20:19.680 --> 20:22.740
- IS SHE PRETENDING TO BE
A BULL MASTIFF?

20:22.780 --> 20:25.340
[chuckles]

20:25.390 --> 20:27.756
OH, I BET SHE'S STOPPING TRAFFIC
IN HEAVEN.

20:27.790 --> 20:30.384
- SHE'S NOT DEAD.

20:30.430 --> 20:33.991
- [sniffs]
GOOD TALK.

20:41.400 --> 20:43.504
- [sniffs]

20:43.540 --> 20:45.462
I GOT NOTHIN'.

20:45.510 --> 20:48.479
- WELL, THE CRIME SCENE PHOTOS
FROM WHEN WE FOUND YOU CAME IN.

20:48.510 --> 20:50.944
MAYBE YOU CAN GET SOMETHING
OFF OF THESE.

20:50.980 --> 20:55.041
[eerie music]

20:55.080 --> 20:58.789
- THERE WAS NO SATCHEL OF DRUGS.

20:58.820 --> 21:01.618
HEY!

21:01.660 --> 21:03.480
I KNOW WHERE IT CAME FROM.

21:03.530 --> 21:06.954
THE MANTIS HAD THE SATCHEL,
NOT THE CAMINO.

21:06.990 --> 21:09.959
I'M SENSING THAT THIS EVIDENCE
WAS PLANTED.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.820
WE'RE DEALING WITH A FAKE BUST.

21:11.870 --> 21:14.293
THE MANTIS IS PADDING HIS RESUME
AND POSSIBLY HIS COSTUME.

21:14.340 --> 21:16.558
- SORRY, SPENCER,
FORENSICS HAS ALREADY CONFIRMED

21:16.600 --> 21:18.306
THE DRUGS CONFISCATED
AT THE SCENE

21:18.340 --> 21:19.967
ARE THE SAME STRAIN SOLD
ON THE STREETS BY THE CAMINOS,

21:20.010 --> 21:21.534
JUST A MUCH LOWER GRADE.

21:21.580 --> 21:23.400
- WHICH CORROBORATES THE INFO
FROM OUR PERP.

21:23.450 --> 21:25.077
THEY PUT OUT QUALITY PRODUCT
FIRST, THEN FLOOD THE AREA

21:25.110 --> 21:26.941
WITH LOWER GRADE
AND MAXIMIZE THE PROFITS.

21:26.980 --> 21:28.641
- IN THAT CASE, I THINK WE
SHOULD CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY

21:28.680 --> 21:29.977
THAT THE MANTIS IS WORKING
WITH THE CAMINOS.

21:30.020 --> 21:31.339
- FIRST, YOU SAY
HE'S ON THE FORCE.

21:31.390 --> 21:32.414
THEN YOU SAY
HE'S WITH THE CAMINOS?

21:32.450 --> 21:34.350
HOW HARD DID THAT GUY HIT YOU?
- HARD.

21:34.390 --> 21:38.349
- LET ME KNOW
WHEN YOU CAN BE USEFUL.

21:38.390 --> 21:40.426
- I'M TELLING YOU, JULES,
WE ARE DEALING

21:40.460 --> 21:42.018
WITH A BAD, BAD DUDE HERE.

21:42.060 --> 21:44.665
- SHAWN, A MESSENGER
DROPPED THIS OFF FOR YOU.

21:50.940 --> 21:52.498
- HEY.

21:52.540 --> 21:55.373
IT'S THE CLOTHES
THE MANTIS STOLE FROM ME.

21:55.410 --> 21:57.037
"SORRY FOR THE INCONVENIENCE.

21:57.080 --> 21:59.901
"I HAD YOUR CLOTHES DRY-CLEANED
AS AN OFFER OF GRATITUDE,

21:59.950 --> 22:02.373
EVEN THOUGH YOU PINCHED
AND BIT ME."

22:02.420 --> 22:05.048
SEE? YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN?
JUST PURE EVIL.

22:05.090 --> 22:06.648
- YOU PINCHED AND BIT A MAN?

22:06.690 --> 22:09.511
- OKAY.
- I KNOW THAT I'VE BEEN OFF,

22:09.560 --> 22:10.822
BUT SERIOUSLY, WHEN HAVE I
EVER BEEN WRONG

22:10.860 --> 22:11.884
WHEN I FELT THIS STRONGLY
ABOUT SOMETHING?

22:11.930 --> 22:13.727
- SHAWN,
WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY

22:13.760 --> 22:15.489
IS THAT MAYBE
WE SHOULD BELIEVE YOU.

22:15.530 --> 22:16.849
I MEAN, IF YOUR SUSPICIONS ABOUT
THE MANTIS ARE THIS STRONG,

22:16.900 --> 22:17.992
THEN MAYBE
WE'RE MISSING SOMETHING.

22:18.030 --> 22:18.997
[telephone rings]
HANG ON.

22:19.030 --> 22:22.363
- THANK YOU.
[ring]

22:22.400 --> 22:25.062
- HELLO?
- IS THIS JULIET O'HARA?

22:25.110 --> 22:26.634
[altered voice]
IT'S THE MANTIS.

22:26.670 --> 22:28.103
- [whispering]
IT'S THE MANTIS.

22:28.140 --> 22:30.005
I'LL PUT IT ON SPEAKER
IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM.

22:30.040 --> 22:33.840
GO TO THE CONFERENCE ROOM.
GO. COME ON.

22:38.990 --> 22:40.548
- OKAY, I'M LISTENING.

22:40.590 --> 22:42.478
- I'D LIKE TO COMPLIMENT
YOUR DEPARTMENT

22:42.520 --> 22:44.488
ON HELPING ME
BRING DOWN THE CAMINOS.

22:44.530 --> 22:46.418
WE MAKE A GOOD TEAM.

22:46.460 --> 22:48.496
- HIS VOICE IS REALLY DEEP.

22:48.530 --> 22:50.020
- [deep voice]
I'VE HEARD DEEPER.

22:50.060 --> 22:52.620
- WOW, REALLY?

22:52.670 --> 22:54.888
- THANK YOU.
- I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW

22:54.940 --> 22:58.501
THAT IN ADDITION TO THE DRUGS
FOUND AT THE LATEST SCENE,

22:58.540 --> 23:00.906
IF YOU RUN D.N.A. ANALYSIS
ON YOUR PERP,

23:00.940 --> 23:04.899
YOU'LL FIND HINTS TO AN UNSOLVED
MURDER FROM LAST YEAR.

23:04.950 --> 23:07.919
- OKAY, WE'LL LOOK INTO IT.
- I ALSO HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE

23:07.950 --> 23:10.418
THAT A HUGE DRUG SHIPMENT
TO THE CAMINOS IS IMMINENT.

23:10.450 --> 23:11.986
- HA! WE ALREADY KNOW THAT ONE.
SUCK IT.

23:12.020 --> 23:12.839
- SHAWN,
WE'RE ALL PROFESSIONALS.

23:12.890 --> 23:16.109
- OH, YEAH? YOU SUCK IT.
- YOU SUCK IT.

23:16.160 --> 23:17.821
WHAT KIND OF MAN TAKES OFF
ANOTHER MAN'S PANTS

23:17.860 --> 23:20.078
IN A SMOKY BOILER ROOM?

23:20.130 --> 23:21.791
I'M ON TO ALL
YOUR LITTLE TRICKS, MAN.

23:21.830 --> 23:23.798
- HAVE THE POLICE GO DOWN
TO THE WAREHOUSE DISTRICT

23:23.830 --> 23:25.058
IN TWO HOURS.

23:25.100 --> 23:26.897
I'LL HAVE ANOTHER SURPRISE
WAITING FOR YOU.

23:26.930 --> 23:29.967
IT'S TIME TO ESCALATE THE GAME.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.968
- UM, THANK YOU.
YOU'VE BEEN VERY HELPFUL,

23:32.010 --> 23:33.705
BUT IT WOULD BE
EVEN MORE HELPFUL

23:33.740 --> 23:36.937
IF YOU TOLD US WHO YOU WERE.
[telephone hangs up]

23:36.980 --> 23:38.971
CRAP.
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

23:39.010 --> 23:40.910
LET'S GET SOME UNITS DOWN
TO THE WAREHOUSE DISTRICT.

23:40.950 --> 23:43.487
LET'S BEAT 'EM TO THIS.

23:43.520 --> 23:46.512
[dramatic music]

23:51.930 --> 23:54.490
- THERE!
- FREEZE, MANTIS!

23:54.530 --> 23:56.020
STEP AWAY FROM THE BODY!

23:56.060 --> 23:59.097
PUT YOUR HANDS
WHERE I CAN SEE 'EM!

23:59.130 --> 24:02.634
[wind rushing]

24:06.640 --> 24:08.779
- WELL...

24:08.810 --> 24:10.778
HE ESCALATED THE GAME,
ALL RIGHT.

24:10.810 --> 24:14.018
- YEAH, TO MURDER.

24:14.050 --> 24:24.255
[dramatic music]

24:24.290 --> 24:25.621
[dramatic music]

24:25.660 --> 24:27.628
- WOW, NOW I CAN
READ THE PAPER

24:27.660 --> 24:29.890
AND LISTEN TO MY MOVIE SCORE
PLAYLIST AT THE SAME TIME.

24:29.930 --> 24:31.921
- WILL YOU MOVE OUT OF THE WAY?
- THAT'S ROUGH.

24:31.970 --> 24:33.494
- QUIT PLAYING AROUND WITH THAT
BEFORE YOU BREAK IT.

24:33.540 --> 24:34.666
- WELL, I GUESS I'M JUST
A LITTLE GIDDY NOW THAT

24:34.700 --> 24:37.635
MY NEMESIS HAS BEEN EXPOSED
FOR THE FRAUD THAT HE WAS.

24:37.670 --> 24:39.501
AND YES, I REALIZE
THAT USING THE TERM "GIDDY"

24:39.540 --> 24:40.939
IS A BIT FACETIOUS,

24:40.980 --> 24:42.800
BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS
I AM TICKLED PINK.

24:42.840 --> 24:44.671
- THE MANTIS IS NOT
YOUR NEMESIS, SHAWN.

24:44.710 --> 24:46.541
YOU DON'T HAVE AN ALTER EGO,
A COOL SUIT,

24:46.580 --> 24:48.548
OR A TRAGICALLY IRONIC
ORIGIN STORY.

24:48.580 --> 24:50.639
YOU'RE JUST A HATER.
- A HATER?

24:50.690 --> 24:53.284
THE ONLY HATER IS THE MANTIS,
HATER OF NOT MURDERING PEOPLE.

24:53.320 --> 24:54.480
- I STILL DON'T GET IT.

24:54.520 --> 24:57.648
SHOOTING A GUY GOES AGAINST
THE MANTIS' ESTABLISHED M.O.

24:57.690 --> 24:58.850
[eerie music]

24:58.890 --> 25:00.027
- AND I DON'T SEE A GUY
WHO IS THAT CONSISTENT

25:00.060 --> 25:02.153
IN HIS MYTHOLOGY
SUDDENLY ABANDONING IT

25:02.200 --> 25:04.293
AND USING A GUN.

25:04.330 --> 25:07.026
- HMM.
- WHAT IS IT?

25:07.070 --> 25:09.197
- OH, NOTHING.
- SHAWN, I KNOW THAT LOOK.

25:09.240 --> 25:11.060
- NO, YOU DON'T.
- YOU JUST DEDUCED SOMETHING

25:11.110 --> 25:12.930
THAT MIGHT PROVE THE MANTIS
IS INNOCENT,

25:12.970 --> 25:14.801
BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO SAY IT,
BECAUSE IT MIGHT MEAN

25:14.840 --> 25:16.671
YOU WERE WRONG ABOUT HIM.
- I DIDN'T DEDUCE ANYTHING.

25:16.710 --> 25:18.598
- SHAWN, YOU ARE AN HYSTERICAL
DEDUCER, AND YOU KNOW IT.

25:18.650 --> 25:20.277
SO SPIT IT OUT.
- OKAY, FINE, LISTEN.

25:20.310 --> 25:22.141
GENERALLY, AS A RULE, WHEN YOU
SHOOT SOMEONE IN THE BACK,

25:22.180 --> 25:24.045
THEY FALL FORWARD, RIGHT?

25:24.090 --> 25:26.217
WELL, WHEN WE SAW THE MANTIS,
THE VICTIM WAS ON HIS BACK.

25:28.220 --> 25:30.188
- MEANING THE MANTIS
HAD TO FLIP THE BODY OVER,

25:30.220 --> 25:32.120
LIKE YOU'D DO IF YOU
WERE CHECKING TO SEE

25:32.160 --> 25:33.991
IF SOMEBODY WAS ALREADY DEAD
WHEN YOU FOUND HIM.

25:34.030 --> 25:35.850
- OR EVEN IF YOU WERE
TRYING TO SAVE HIM.

25:35.900 --> 25:37.595
- SHAWN, THIS MAN IS INNOCENT,

25:37.630 --> 25:39.268
AND WE NEED TO HELP HIM
CLEAR HIS NAME.

25:39.300 --> 25:40.995
- WELL, GUESS WHAT, GUS?
WE CAN'T.

25:41.040 --> 25:42.860
- WHY NOT?
- 'CAUSE THAT IS THE DOWNSIDE

25:42.900 --> 25:45.266
OF BEING ALL SECRET IDENTITY.

25:45.310 --> 25:47.005
LOOK, WE CAN'T FIND HIM,

25:47.040 --> 25:49.600
UNLESS WE BLAST THE MANTIS LIGHT
INTO THE SKY,

25:49.640 --> 25:51.642
WHICH WOULD BE
PRETTY STUPID, RIGHT?

25:51.680 --> 25:53.079
BECAUSE THE MANTIS LOOKS
LIKE A LITTLE STICK

25:53.110 --> 25:54.213
THAT WALKS AROUND.

25:54.250 --> 25:55.376
- YOU'RE THINKING
OF A WALKING STICK.

25:55.420 --> 25:57.741
- NO, THOSE ARE THE BUGS
THAT HOP AROUND IN THE GRASS.

25:57.790 --> 25:58.882
- THAT'S A GRASSHOPPER.

25:58.920 --> 26:01.889
- "COULD NOT REMOVE STAIN
ON SLEEVE."

26:01.920 --> 26:04.286
WELL, I COULD'VE TOLD 'EM THAT.
NOTHING GETS OUT MOTOR OIL,

26:04.330 --> 26:07.254
ESPECIALLY NOT MORE MOTOR OIL,
WHICH I'VE TRIED.

26:09.700 --> 26:11.668
GUS.

26:11.700 --> 26:13.793
YOU KNOW HOW THE POLICE

26:13.840 --> 26:15.865
COULDN'T TRACE THAT PACKAGE
BACK TO THE MANTIS?

26:15.900 --> 26:18.368
- YEAH, BECAUSE HE PAID IN CASH
AND DIDN'T LEAVE A RECORD.

26:18.410 --> 26:20.366
- BUT HE DIDN'T KNOW
THE DRY CLEANERS

26:20.410 --> 26:24.369
PUT THIS IN MY JACKET.

26:24.410 --> 26:25.946
- A PAPER TRAIL.

26:30.420 --> 26:32.638
- YEAH, THAT WAS
A SPECIAL RUSH ORDER.

26:32.690 --> 26:34.681
I'M SORRY, I CAN'T GIVE YOU
ANY MORE THAN THAT. NO.

26:34.720 --> 26:35.914
- WELL, WE'RE
PAYING CUSTOMERS HERE.

26:35.960 --> 26:37.313
- WELL, WHERE ARE YOUR ITEMS?

26:37.360 --> 26:38.679
- DUDE, TAKE OFF YOUR SHIRT.

26:38.730 --> 26:39.788
GIVE IT TO HER
FOR DRY-CLEANING.

26:39.830 --> 26:41.058
- YOU MUST BE OUT
OF YOUR DAMN MIND.

26:41.100 --> 26:42.795
GIVE HER YOUR SHIRT.
- THEN WHAT AM I SUPPOSED

26:42.830 --> 26:44.320
TO WEAR TOMORROW?
AND THE DAY AFTER THAT?

26:44.370 --> 26:46.691
AND THE DAY AFTER THAT?
- I DON'T KNOW.

26:49.870 --> 26:51.667
OOPS, MY BAD.

26:51.710 --> 26:53.678
- SHAWN,
THIS IS A CUSTOM-MADE SHIRT.

26:53.710 --> 26:55.337
- UH-OH. WELL, WHAT CAN WE DO
ABOUT THIS STAIN

26:55.380 --> 26:56.904
BEFORE IT SETS IN?

26:56.940 --> 26:58.771
- I HAVE SOME INDUSTRIAL
STAIN-BLOCK IN THE BACK.

26:58.810 --> 27:01.210
- JUST A MINUTE.
- ALL RIGHT.

27:25.110 --> 27:28.204
- SHAWN.
SHAWN, WILL YOU HURRY UP?

27:28.240 --> 27:30.800
- BINGO. IT'S HIS
REGULAR DRY CLEANERS.

27:30.850 --> 27:32.249
I GOT THE ADDRESS.
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

27:32.280 --> 27:33.770
- ALL RIGHT.

27:33.820 --> 27:35.412
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE.
WHAT DO WE GOT HERE?

27:35.450 --> 27:39.113
OH, THAT'S KIND OF WEIRD.
WHAT DOES IT FEEL LIKE?

27:39.150 --> 27:41.983
LOOK AT THAT, BUDDY.

27:42.020 --> 27:44.124
OH.

27:44.160 --> 27:47.926
THERE IT IS.
LOOK AT THAT.

27:47.960 --> 27:51.259
GOOD AS NEW, BUDDY.
GOOD WORK FROM YOU.

27:51.300 --> 27:52.961
- [sighS]

27:54.370 --> 27:56.930
[door opening]
- WE'RE IN, GUS.

27:56.970 --> 27:59.200
- I DON'T KNOW, SHAWN.

27:59.240 --> 28:01.208
ARE YOU SURE THIS IS
THE RIGHT PLACE?

28:01.240 --> 28:04.209
- 501, JUST LIKE
THE COMPUTER SAID.

28:04.250 --> 28:07.003
OH, I HEAR YOU. THIS PLACE ISN'T
VERY SUPERHERO-ISH, IS IT?

28:10.480 --> 28:12.209
- MAYBE WE MADE A MISTAKE.

28:12.250 --> 28:14.252
- * WHAT?

28:14.290 --> 28:16.884
* WHAT?

28:16.920 --> 28:19.980
- YOU KNOW THAT'S RIGHT.

28:20.030 --> 28:21.998
[loud clatter]
- WE NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE.

28:22.030 --> 28:23.998
- WE SHOULDN'T BE HERE
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

28:24.030 --> 28:25.998
- YOU SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF
THAT BEFORE YOU PICKED THE LOCK.

28:26.030 --> 28:28.191
- NO, YOU PICKED THE LOCK.
- [whistling]

28:28.240 --> 28:30.060
- HUMAN SHIELD.

28:30.100 --> 28:33.399
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
- HE'S THE MANTIS?

28:33.440 --> 28:35.271
- COME ON, CHIEF, CAN YOU
GIVE US ANY INFORMATION?

28:35.310 --> 28:37.005
WHAT CAN YOU TELL US?
- THAT'S HOW HE GOT

28:37.040 --> 28:39.270
THE INFORMATION
FOR THE BUST ON THE 26th.

28:39.310 --> 28:41.949
[camera shutter clicks]

28:41.980 --> 28:43.914
- WAIT, WE'RE HERE
TO ACTUALLY HELP YOU--AAH!

28:43.950 --> 28:46.009
- CLEAR YOUR--AAH!

28:46.050 --> 28:48.814
- BECAUSE WE KNOW--UGH!

28:48.860 --> 28:52.318
- WE KNOW THAT YOU WERE--AAH!

28:52.360 --> 28:54.828
- COZENED! UGH!

28:54.860 --> 28:59.490
- NOBODY KNOWS
WHAT "COZENED" MEANS.

28:59.530 --> 29:01.066
[groans]

29:01.100 --> 29:05.264
- "COZENED" IS A FAIRLY COMMON
WORD, SHAWN. AAH!

29:05.310 --> 29:07.778
- WHY CAN'T YOU JUST BE
A NORMAL PERSON AND SAY--

29:07.810 --> 29:09.437
- "FRAMED"?
WE KNOW YOU WERE FRAMED?

29:09.480 --> 29:13.143
- YOU DO?
- YEAH. [groans]

29:15.150 --> 29:17.368
- I'M REALLY, REALLY SORRY
ABOUT THIS, GUYS.

29:17.420 --> 29:19.388
I THOUGHT YOU WERE HERE
TO TAKE ME IN TO THE POLICE.

29:19.420 --> 29:22.082
- NO, WE THINK YOU'RE INNOCENT.
- MIGHT BE INNOCENT.

29:22.120 --> 29:24.350
I AM NOT YET CONVINCED.
- IT'S AMAZING.

29:24.390 --> 29:26.358
NOBODY'S GOTTEN THIS CLOSE
TO ACTUALLY FIGURING OUT

29:26.390 --> 29:29.359
WHO I REALLY AM.
YOUR PSYCHIC POWERS ARE AMAZING.

29:29.400 --> 29:31.220
- GUS, WE HAVE TO HELP HIM.
HE'S A GOOD MAN.

29:31.270 --> 29:32.965
- FIRST, I HAVE TO KNOW,

29:33.000 --> 29:34.934
WHY WOULD A REPORTER WANT
TO BECOME A SUPERHERO?

29:34.970 --> 29:36.460
- ALL I DO EVERY DAY IS WRITE

29:36.500 --> 29:39.207
ABOUT RECENT PET GROOMING TRENDS
IN SANTA BARBARA,

29:39.240 --> 29:41.970
WHERE ROB LOWE HAD BRUNCH,
WHERE ROB LOWE HAD DINNER...

29:42.010 --> 29:44.149
- LUCKY'S.
- AND THE POLITICS AND RED TAPE

29:44.180 --> 29:46.000
THAT KEEP THE POLICE
IN THIS TOWN

29:46.050 --> 29:48.917
FROM ACTUALLY DOING THEIR JOB.
SO I DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING.

29:48.950 --> 29:50.577
WITH MY BACKGROUND
IN MIXED MARTIAL ARTS,

29:50.620 --> 29:52.178
THE MANTIS WAS BORN.

29:52.220 --> 29:54.051
- AND THE FIRST THING
YOU DECIDED TO DO

29:54.090 --> 29:55.910
WAS GO AFTER THE BIGGEST
DRUG GANG IN TOWN?

29:55.960 --> 29:57.928
- I KNEW THAT THE CAMINOS
OPERATED IN SMALL GROUPS

29:57.960 --> 29:59.427
WITH EACH DRUG TRANSACTION,

29:59.460 --> 30:01.052
WHICH MAKES 'EM
QUICK AND MOBILE,

30:01.100 --> 30:03.193
BUT IT ALSO KEEPS THEM
PRETTY VULNERABLE,

30:03.230 --> 30:05.095
IF YOU HAVE THEIR SCHEDULE
IN ADVANCE.

30:05.130 --> 30:06.961
- OKAY, SO WHAT REALLY HAPPENED
TO THE GUY ON THE ROOFTOP

30:07.000 --> 30:08.297
OF THE BAINE BUILDING?

30:08.340 --> 30:10.558
- THAT WAS CARLOS JACOTT.

30:10.600 --> 30:13.307
HE WAS MY INSIDE MAN
WITH THE CAMINOS.

30:13.340 --> 30:15.308
THE HEAD BOSSES FOUND OUT
HE WAS TRADING SECRETS,

30:15.340 --> 30:17.171
AND SO THEY KILLED HIM
FOR SNITCHING.

30:17.210 --> 30:19.178
AND THEN THEY SET ME UP TO LOOK
LIKE I WAS A MURDERER.

30:19.210 --> 30:20.575
- WELL, THEY'RE DESPERATE.

30:20.610 --> 30:22.441
YOU'RE VERY CLOSE
TO BRINGING 'EM DOWN.

30:22.480 --> 30:24.311
- YEAH, BUT NOT CLOSE ENOUGH.
I STILL CAN'T FIGURE OUT

30:24.350 --> 30:26.409
HOW THE DRUGS ARE GETTING
TO THE SYNDICATE.

30:26.450 --> 30:28.418
YOU KNOW, I'VE LOOKED
INTO ALL THE CLEVER WAYS

30:28.460 --> 30:30.416
CRIMINALS ARE SMUGGLING DRUGS
THESE DAYS--

30:30.460 --> 30:33.554
INSIDE CHILDREN'S TOYS,
SEAFOOD SHIPMENTS,

30:33.590 --> 30:35.626
PLASTICS.
- WHAT ABOUT GLASS?

30:35.660 --> 30:38.094
- I SUPPOSE
THAT COULD WORK, YEAH.

30:38.130 --> 30:40.098
YOU COULD EMBED THE COCAINE
IN THE GLASS,

30:40.130 --> 30:43.497
AND THEN MELT IT,
SEPARATE IT AT A LATER TIME.

30:43.540 --> 30:46.259
- THAT'S IT. AAH!
I CAN SEE THE DRUGS

30:46.310 --> 30:49.529
INFUSED IN PANES OF GLASS

30:49.580 --> 30:51.946
LOADED INTO CARGO CONTAINERS,
A BUNCH OF 'EM,

30:51.980 --> 30:56.519
IN A SHIPMENT YARD
CALLED N-O--

30:56.550 --> 30:59.417
NO...
- NOSCO. NOSCO.

30:59.450 --> 31:01.611
THAT'S A CARGO COMPANY.
THEY SHIP FROM OVERSEAS.

31:01.660 --> 31:03.480
- SO THAT'S HOW THEY'VE BEEN
MOVING SO MUCH PRODUCT

31:03.520 --> 31:05.351
WITHOUT BEING DETECTED.
- YEAH, WE'VE JUST GOT

31:05.390 --> 31:07.221
TO FIGURE OUT WHERE
THOSE CARGO CRATES OF GLASS

31:07.260 --> 31:08.625
ARE ENTERING SANTA BARBARA

31:08.660 --> 31:10.355
BEFORE THE DRUGS
HIT THE STREETS.

31:10.400 --> 31:11.890
BUT I'M SENSING
YOU'RE NOT GONNA WANT

31:11.930 --> 31:12.897
TO HELP WITH THAT, ARE YOU?

31:12.930 --> 31:15.091
- WHAT, ARE YOU NUTS?
NOW I'VE GOT THE COPS

31:15.140 --> 31:18.359
AND THE CAMINOS FOLLOWING ME.
THE MANTIS IS DONE.

31:18.410 --> 31:21.504
- REGINALD, AS DIFFICULT
AS THIS IS FOR ME TO SAY,

31:21.540 --> 31:23.508
YOU WERE ACTUALLY MAKING
A DIFFERENCE.

31:23.540 --> 31:26.100
I MEAN, THE CAMINO SYNDICATE
WAS RUNNING SCARED

31:26.150 --> 31:27.503
ALL BECAUSE OF YOU.

31:27.550 --> 31:29.370
- YOUR PRESENCE ALONE
WILL SLOW THEM DOWN.

31:29.420 --> 31:31.240
- TRUST US, ALL YOU
HAVE TO DO IS SHOW UP

31:31.290 --> 31:33.417
TO THAT SHIPMENT YARD. THEY'LL
TAKE ONE LOOK AT YOU AND RUN.

31:33.450 --> 31:35.554
- [makes whooshing noise]
- YEAH, I DON'T KNOW, GUYS.

31:35.590 --> 31:38.559
I MEAN, IT'S ONE THING
TO FIGHT ONE-ON-FOUR,

31:38.590 --> 31:41.058
BUT IF WE ACTUALLY DO FIND
THEIR DISTRIBUTION CENTER,

31:41.100 --> 31:44.069
IT'S GONNA BE
MORE LIKE ONE-ON-TEN.

31:44.100 --> 31:46.091
- WHAT IF YOU HAD HELP?

31:46.130 --> 31:48.496
- DETECTIVE UNIT
BACKUP REQUEST--

31:48.540 --> 31:50.462
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION
AT WAREHOUSE DISTRICT,

31:50.500 --> 31:51.967
3900 SALTAIR.

32:05.120 --> 32:07.486
[footsteps]

32:07.520 --> 32:09.681
[dramatic music]

32:13.560 --> 32:15.551
' [tapping]

32:15.600 --> 32:16.999
- IT'S THE MANTIS!

32:17.030 --> 32:19.089
- THE CATCH.

32:19.130 --> 32:21.098
- AND TAP-MAN!

32:21.140 --> 32:23.131
[tap music]

32:30.280 --> 32:33.443
- GIVE UP WHILE YOU STILL CAN.
WE KNOW HOW THIS WILL END.

32:33.480 --> 32:35.471
[electricity buzzing]

32:40.320 --> 32:42.652
' [tapping]

32:42.690 --> 32:45.284
[gunshots]

32:47.490 --> 32:49.720
- SHAWN, I THOUGHT YOU SAID WE
WERE GONNA JUST SCARE THEM AWAY!

32:49.760 --> 32:51.728
THEY DON'T SEEM SCARED TO ME!
- THAT'S 'CAUSE YOU JUST WENT UP

32:51.770 --> 32:54.989
ON YOUR TOES
AND STARTED DANCING!

32:55.040 --> 32:57.395
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?
- YOU TWO GO DISTRACT 'EM.

32:57.440 --> 33:01.103
I'LL TAKE 'EM OUT ONE BY ONE.
[gunshots]

33:05.780 --> 33:09.477
[wind rushing]

33:15.360 --> 33:17.316
- [grunting]

33:17.360 --> 33:20.682
[loud banging]

33:20.730 --> 33:23.028
- [grunts]

33:34.140 --> 33:36.108
- DETECT IVES LASSITER
AND O'HARA

33:36.140 --> 33:38.370
REQUESTING BACKUP
UNDER HEAW FIRE!

33:56.400 --> 33:58.220
- I TOLD YOU THIS WAS
A BAD IDEA.

33:58.270 --> 33:59.623
- THE ONLY BAD IDEA

33:59.670 --> 34:02.230
WAS YOU THINKING THAT TAP-MAN
WOULD FOOL ANYONE.

34:02.270 --> 34:04.238
- IT'S BETTER THAN ANYTHING
THAT CATCHER MAN HAS.

34:04.270 --> 34:05.760
- THE CATCH.
- WHATEVER.

34:05.810 --> 34:07.232
HE HAS NO SKILLS AT ALL.

34:07.270 --> 34:08.737
- THE CATCH IS
AN IMPENETRABLE WALL, GUS,

34:08.780 --> 34:11.340
AND HE WILL SMACK THE MESS
OUT OF YOU WITH THIS MITT.

34:11.380 --> 34:14.372
- PLEASE.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

34:14.420 --> 34:16.638
- MAN, BEFORE ANYTHING WENT
WRONG, YOU WERE TOTALLY ON BOARD

34:16.680 --> 34:18.784
WITH CATCH AND TAP-MAN.
- TAP-MAN AND THE CATCH.

34:18.820 --> 34:20.515
GET IT RIGHT.
[loud crunch]

34:20.550 --> 34:22.188
- WHAT WAS THAT?

34:29.600 --> 34:31.568
- MAN, I TOLD YOU
THAT WOULDN'T WORK.

34:31.600 --> 34:34.637
- YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE.
- SHUT UP!

34:34.670 --> 34:36.137
-AAH!

34:38.610 --> 34:41.636
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

34:41.680 --> 34:43.238
GUYS!
- WHAT?

34:43.280 --> 34:45.305
- COME ON!
- OW, OKAY.

34:45.350 --> 34:47.341
[gunshots]

34:49.450 --> 34:51.611
- FREEZE!
PUT YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR!

34:51.650 --> 34:53.481
PUT 'EM UP!

34:53.520 --> 34:56.250
GET DOWN! GET DOWN!

34:58.790 --> 35:00.781
- GET DOWN! SPREAD 'EM!

35:03.260 --> 35:04.898
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
HOLD IT!

35:04.930 --> 35:06.761
GET DOWN ON THE GROUND, MANTIS!
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,

35:06.800 --> 35:08.267
LASSIE, JULES, WAIT.
HE'S WITH US.

35:08.300 --> 35:09.631
- I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU SAY, SPENCER.

35:09.670 --> 35:11.137
THIS MAN'S WANTED FOR MURDER.
- NO, NO, NO,

35:11.170 --> 35:12.501
THE MANTIS WAS FRAMED.

35:12.540 --> 35:13.905
WHEN WE CAUGHT HIM
ABOVE THE BODY,

35:13.940 --> 35:16.238
HE WAS ACTUALLY TRYING
TO REVIVE THE VICTIM.

35:16.280 --> 35:18.646
AND IF YOU RUN BALLISTICS
ON THE CAMINOS' FIREARMS,

35:18.680 --> 35:19.806
I BET YOU FIND
YOUR MURDER WEAPON.

35:19.850 --> 35:22.671
- SPENCER, WE CAN SORT ALL THIS
OUT DOWN AT THE STATION.

35:22.720 --> 35:24.540
ESPECIALLY WHY ARE YOU WEARING
THAT RIDICULOUS GET-UP?

35:24.590 --> 35:26.410
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU SUPPOSED
TO BE ANYWAY, THE TURTLE?

35:26.450 --> 35:27.815
- I AM THE CATCH,

35:27.850 --> 35:29.681
THOUGH I MIGHT
HAVE TO BORROW "THE TURTLE"

35:29.720 --> 35:31.551
IF "THE CATCH" IS ALREADY TAKEN.
THAT'S NOT BAD--"THE TURTLE."

35:31.590 --> 35:33.148
- YEAH.
- WE'RE DONE HERE.

35:33.190 --> 35:34.521
I'M TAKING HIM IN.
- OOH.

35:34.560 --> 35:35.652
- GUSTER.
[spits]

35:35.700 --> 35:38.760
GUSTER, DID YOU
JUST THROW SAND AT ME?

35:38.800 --> 35:40.324
OH, HELL.

35:40.370 --> 35:42.190
WHERE'S THE MANTIS?

35:42.240 --> 35:44.333
- OH, GOOD, YOU'RE ALL HERE.

35:44.370 --> 35:46.736
UH, THE MAYOR JUST CALLED.

35:46.770 --> 35:48.772
I WOULD LIKE TO PASS ON
HIS CONGRATULATIONS

35:48.810 --> 35:51.278
TO ALL OF YOU FOR BRINGING DOWN
THE CAMINO SYNDICATE.

35:51.310 --> 35:53.346
- OH, JUST DOING
OUR JOB, CHIEF.

35:53.380 --> 35:55.746
- BESIDES, IT WAS SHAWN
WHO PSYCHICALLY REALIZED

35:55.780 --> 35:57.338
THE MANTIS HAD BEEN FRAMED

35:57.380 --> 35:59.348
AND LED HIM
TO CAMINOS' HEADQUARTERS.

35:59.390 --> 36:00.812
HE REALLY DESERVES
ALL THE CREDIT.

36:00.850 --> 36:02.784
- I WOULDN'T SAY THAT.
WELL, NOT THAT IT ISN'T TRUE.

36:02.820 --> 36:04.458
I-I JUST WOULDN'T SAY IT.

36:04.490 --> 36:06.321
- OH, COME ON. YOU MIGHT
LIKE IT IF YOU TRY IT.

36:06.360 --> 36:08.749
- I WOULD RATHER SPEND THE REST
OF MY LIFE AT LILITH FAIR.

36:08.800 --> 36:10.654
- FAIR ENOUGH.
- OKAY, BUT, GENTLEMEN,

36:10.700 --> 36:12.520
THIS CASE IS FAR FROM OVER.

36:12.570 --> 36:14.390
WE'RE STILL LOOKING
FOR WHERE THE CAMINOS

36:14.440 --> 36:16.237
HID ALL THE MONEY THAT THEY MADE
FROM THE DRUG TRADE.

36:16.270 --> 36:18.238
- DON'T WORRY, CHIEF, IF IT
HASN'T ALREADY BEEN LAUNDERED,

36:18.270 --> 36:20.238
IT'S BOUND TO SHOW UP SOMEWHERE.
- JUST LIKE NO ONE WILL KNOW

36:20.270 --> 36:22.579
WHERE OR WHEN TAP-MAN
AND THE CATCH MAY SHOW UP.

36:22.610 --> 36:24.305
- [laughs]
THE CATCH AND TAP-MAN.

36:24.350 --> 36:25.840
- SHAWN.
- OH, I THINK WE KNOW

36:25.880 --> 36:27.848
A LOT OF PLACES AND TIMES
THEY BETTER NOT SHOW UP.

36:27.880 --> 36:29.848
ARE WE CLEAR ON THAT?
both: YES, MA'AM.

36:29.880 --> 36:31.381
- GOOD DAY, GENTLEMEN.

36:35.620 --> 36:36.985
- LUNCH LATER?
- YOU BET.

36:37.020 --> 36:38.851
I JUST GOTTA DROP SOMETHING OFF
TO A FRIEND FIRST.

36:38.890 --> 36:40.926
- OKAY.

36:40.960 --> 36:43.793
- REGINALD, I HAD YOUR SUIT
DRY-CLEANED.

36:43.830 --> 36:46.264
[sighs] HEY--

36:53.510 --> 36:55.478
- WE'RE STILL LOOKING
FOR WHERE THE CAMINOS HID

36:55.510 --> 36:57.307
ALL THE MONEY THAT THEY MADE
FROM THEIR DUG TRADE.

36:57.340 --> 36:59.570
- WE HAVE IDENTIFIED A HANDFUL
OF THE PHONY BUSINESSES

36:59.610 --> 37:01.976
THAT THEY ARE USING AS FRONTS,
BUT THERE COULD BE A DOZEN MORE.

37:08.520 --> 37:10.010
- THAT WAS CARLOS JACOTT.

37:10.060 --> 37:12.620
HE WAS MY INSIDE MAN
WITH THE CAMINOS.

37:12.660 --> 37:14.252
- SON OF A...

37:28.070 --> 37:30.777
- LOOKING TOUGH THERE, SPORT.
- THANKS.

37:30.810 --> 37:33.847
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU GIVE A BAD NAME

37:33.880 --> 37:36.644
TO ALL THE GOOD MANTISES
EVERYWHERE.

37:36.680 --> 37:39.444
THIS WAS NEVER ABOUT HONOR
OR JUSTICE

37:39.490 --> 37:40.980
OR EVEN PRESIDENTIAL FITNESS.

37:41.020 --> 37:44.319
YOU JUST WANTED
TO TAKE DOWN THE CAMINOS

37:44.360 --> 37:46.328
SO YOU COULD STEAL
THEIR DIRTY MONEY.

37:46.360 --> 37:48.021
- [applauds]

37:48.060 --> 37:51.359
I'VE GOTTA SAY, I'M IMPRESSED.
YOU FIGURED IT OUT.

37:51.400 --> 37:53.368
THE TRUTH IS

37:53.400 --> 37:55.789
I COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT
WITHOUT YOUR HELP.

37:55.840 --> 37:58.058
- MAN, THE DEAL WAS WE HELP YOU
BRING DOWN THE CAMINOS,

37:58.100 --> 38:00.933
NOT WE HELP YOU GET RICH.
YOU'VE RISKED MY LIFE.

38:00.970 --> 38:03.404
YOU RISKED GUS' LIFE--
FOR WHAT?

38:03.440 --> 38:05.374
WHAT, A MILLION DOLLARS
IN DRUG MONEY?

38:05.410 --> 38:07.901
- ACTUALLY, ABOUT $10 MILLION.
- NO KIDDING.

38:07.950 --> 38:09.918
- YEAH. THE IRONY IS

38:09.950 --> 38:11.918
I WAS ABOUT TO GIVE UP
UNTIL YOU AND YOUR PARTNER

38:11.950 --> 38:14.510
HELPED SOLVE THE FINAL PIECE
OF THE PUZZLE.

38:14.560 --> 38:16.516
THAT'S HOW THEY'VE BEEN MOVING
SO MUCH PRODUCT

38:16.560 --> 38:18.721
WITHOUT BEING DETECTED.

38:18.760 --> 38:20.387
AND WHAT HAPPENED
AT THE GLASS FACT ORY--

38:20.430 --> 38:22.318
I COULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT
ON MY OWN.

38:22.360 --> 38:25.693
SO HERE,
THANKS FOR COMING OUT, CHAMP.

38:27.970 --> 38:29.938
- THOSE ARE ALL BENJAMINS?
- OH, YEAH.

38:29.970 --> 38:31.858
- HOLY SH--NO, NO! NO!

38:31.910 --> 38:33.662
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

38:33.710 --> 38:36.406
YOU KNOW I CAN'T LET YOU
GET AWAY WITH THIS, REGINALD.

38:36.440 --> 38:37.930
- ALL RIGHT.

38:37.980 --> 38:39.948
YOU WANT ME TO KICK YOUR ASS
FOR THE THIRD TIME?

38:39.980 --> 38:41.811
- YEAH.

38:41.850 --> 38:45.479
ONLY NOW YOU'RE DEALING
WITH THE CATCH.

38:45.520 --> 38:48.580
[grunting]
- AAH! [groaning]

38:50.490 --> 38:53.789
- OW. OW.
- [grunting]

38:53.830 --> 38:56.094
- [groans]
- STRIKE ONE!

38:58.570 --> 39:00.595
- [grunting]
- STRIKE TWO!

39:00.630 --> 39:03.861
[metal clangs]
- [grunting]

39:03.900 --> 39:06.107
- THAT'S ALL YOU GOT?

39:08.110 --> 39:10.078
- [tapping]
- YEAH!

39:10.110 --> 39:12.840
[yelling]
THAT'S RIGHT IN MY EYE!

39:12.880 --> 39:14.575
AAH!

39:14.620 --> 39:16.679
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO JUMP IN
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE FIGHT!

39:21.860 --> 39:23.919
- FREEZE!
- IT'S OKAY.

39:29.660 --> 39:32.390
- THE CATCH CANNOT...

39:32.430 --> 39:34.796
BE STOPPED!

39:34.840 --> 39:37.058
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
- SHAWN!

39:37.100 --> 39:39.432
- DAGNABBIT, SHAWN!
- SHAWN!

39:50.780 --> 39:52.384
- HOLD IT!
- [gasp5]

39:54.150 --> 39:55.754
- [deep vo'
NO! Ice]

40:04.500 --> 40:07.958
NOBODY STEALS ON THE CATCH, GUS,
NOBODY.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.695
- YOU KNOW THAT'S RIGHT.

40:09.740 --> 40:11.958
- [groaning]
OH, GOD.

40:12.010 --> 40:22.147
OH, GOD. OHH.

40:22.180 --> 40:25.149
- HERE YOU GO. [sighs]
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU INSIST

40:25.190 --> 40:27.146
ON DEPOSITING
ALL OF OUR CHECKS YOURSELF.

40:27.190 --> 40:29.158
- BECAUSE THE LAST TIME
I HAD YOU DO IT,

40:29.190 --> 40:30.885
YOU ASKED FOR IT
ALL IN SINGLES.

40:30.920 --> 40:32.729
- GUS, I WANTED
TO MAKE IT RAIN.

40:32.760 --> 40:34.921
- HALF OF OUR CHECK BLEW OUT
AN OPEN WINDOW, SHAWN.

40:34.960 --> 40:36.825
- WELL, MAYBE THIS WILL
MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

40:36.860 --> 40:38.225
- WHAT IS THIS?

40:38.260 --> 40:39.966
- THAT IS YOUR SHIRT
FROM EARLIER.

40:40.000 --> 40:41.695
NOW IT TOOK A FEW CYCLES,

40:41.740 --> 40:43.537
BUT I MANAGED TO GET
THE STAIN OUT COMPLETELY.

40:43.570 --> 40:46.607
- PLEASE TELL ME YOU DIDN'T
PUT MY DRY-CLEAN-ONLY SHIRT

40:46.640 --> 40:48.631
IN THE WASHER.
- YOU BET I DID.

40:48.680 --> 40:50.773
- IT SHRUNK, SHAWN.

40:50.810 --> 40:52.141
- YEAH, BUT SO DID THE STAIN.

40:52.180 --> 40:54.148
LOOK, YOU CAN'T SEE IT
AT ALL ANYMORE.

40:54.180 --> 40:56.819
- THIS SHIRT COST ME $100.
YOU OWE ME A NEW ONE.

40:56.850 --> 40:59.819
- WHAT? I WOULD NEVER SPEND
$100 ON A SHIRT.

40:59.850 --> 41:02.080
[chuckles] YOU MUST BE CRAZY.
- FINE.

41:02.120 --> 41:04.759
THEN I'LL JUSC')THT;AKE YOURS.

41:06.190 --> 41:08.021
YOU DID THAT ON PURPOSE.

41:08.060 --> 41:11.564
- NO, THAT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

41:11.600 --> 41:13.625
THIS WAS ON PURPOSE.

41:13.670 --> 41:15.535
- GIVE ME THOSE SLEEVES!
- MAKE ME.

41:15.570 --> 41:18.539
- YOU KNOW, YOU AND SHAWN
JUST GOT OFF ON THE WRONG FOOT.

41:18.570 --> 41:20.936
IN TIME, YOU WILL SEE THAT HE
REALLY IS A GREAT GUY.

41:20.970 --> 41:23.507
- A GREAT GUY WHO CALLS
YOUR GRANDMOTHER A DOG.

41:23.540 --> 41:26.179
- HMM?

41:26.210 --> 41:28.178
- SHE'S NOT A DOG.

41:28.210 --> 41:30.917
- OH, I'M--I'M SURE SHE ISN'T.

41:30.950 --> 41:32.918
- AND THAT WAS AFTER SHAWN
AND HIS PARTNER

41:32.950 --> 41:35.817
POKED AND PRODDED ME
LIKE I WAS A PIECE OF MEAT.

41:35.860 --> 41:39.182
- YEAH, UM, IT MAY SEEM
UNORTHODOX AT THE TIME,

41:39.230 --> 41:41.186
BUT THERE'S ALWAYS
A PERFECT LY LOGICAL EXPLANATION

41:41.230 --> 41:43.027
FOR EVERYTHING
THAT SHAWN DOES.

41:49.670 --> 41:51.160
- GIVE ME THOSE SLEEVES.

41:51.200 --> 41:54.306
- THEN AGAIN, SOME THINGS
ARE BETTER LEFT UNEXPLAINED.

41:54.340 --> 41:57.901
- STOP, SHAWN!
- GIVE IT!

41:57.940 --> 42:00.807
- I STILL THINK HE'D BE PERFECT
FOR MY BUDDY PETE.
