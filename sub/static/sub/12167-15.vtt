WEBVTT

00:06.937 --> 00:09.022
- There you are.
- Hey.

00:09.189 --> 00:11.775
I was just stealing a breath of fresh air.

00:11.942 --> 00:15.821
- I thought you were off exploring the city.
- About to.

00:15.987 --> 00:20.033
Picked this up on the mainland.
The Athosians made it.

00:20.867 --> 00:23.370
Happy birthday.

00:25.038 --> 00:26.706
Hmm.

00:29.292 --> 00:31.795
It's beautiful.

00:31.962 --> 00:34.214
How did you find out?

00:34.381 --> 00:36.633
Mum's the word.

00:45.100 --> 00:48.186
<i>(Sheppard) Done with the living quarters.
Moving on.</i>

00:48.353 --> 00:51.398
You see anything better
than our current quarters?

00:51.565 --> 00:53.942
A few. Some of them are pretty nice.

00:54.109 --> 00:56.444
What kind of square footage?

00:56.611 --> 01:01.241
What am I, your realtor, Rodney? We're
here to unlock the secrets of Atlantis.

01:01.408 --> 01:06.163
<i>A one-bedroom with a den and preferably
a balcony, but I'm not married to it.</i>

01:06.329 --> 01:09.666
<i>- Check this out!
- Be comfortable until the Wraith get here.</i>

01:09.833 --> 01:11.835
Shut up for a second.

01:25.015 --> 01:28.518
<i>- (McKay) What? What is it?
- Some sort of laboratory.</i>

01:28.685 --> 01:31.563
<i>We've come across dozens.
The city's full of them.</i>

01:31.730 --> 01:33.940
<i>Something unusual about it?</i>

01:48.455 --> 01:53.168
I'd have to say... yes.

03:05.782 --> 03:10.453
We could stand here looking at her all day.
We've gotta get her out of this box.

03:10.620 --> 03:13.290
We can't. She's at least 100 years old.

03:13.456 --> 03:17.210
Which is why every second counts!
She could drop dead.

03:17.377 --> 03:19.379
How? You said she was frozen.

03:19.546 --> 03:24.134
She's in a state of metabolic stasis,
ageing slowed but not entirely suspended.

03:24.301 --> 03:26.803
- This woman is still alive?
- Yes.

03:26.970 --> 03:32.434
Life-sign systems indicate viability. She's
been in that chamber for 10,000 years.

03:32.601 --> 03:34.686
10,000 years?!

03:36.021 --> 03:38.231
Doesn't look a day over 9,000.

03:38.398 --> 03:42.777
She'll continue to age until she dies,
sooner rather than later,

03:42.944 --> 03:45.030
bringing me back to my point.

03:45.197 --> 03:49.117
She's so old I'm afraid
reviving her might actually kill her.

03:49.284 --> 03:53.872
We cannot let this chance to talk to
an Ancient slip through our fingers - again.

03:54.039 --> 03:58.418
Who knows her state of mind? She might
be carrying some horrifying contagion.

03:58.585 --> 04:01.963
Who knows what she knows
about our city, or any ZPMs?

04:02.130 --> 04:04.633
Ah, there's a thought.

04:08.178 --> 04:09.846
- Revive her.
- But...

04:10.013 --> 04:12.516
- It's my call.
- Thank you.

04:16.978 --> 04:19.272
And we thought this city was abandoned.

04:19.439 --> 04:23.401
Is it possible the Atlanteans left her
when they abandoned the city?

04:23.568 --> 04:26.738
- Maybe she wanted to stay.
- Or they forgot about her.

04:26.905 --> 04:28.990
In which case she's gonna be pissed.

04:29.157 --> 04:31.660
If she remembers anything at all.

04:43.463 --> 04:45.799
Breathing shallow.

04:45.966 --> 04:48.385
Pulse rapid.

04:48.552 --> 04:52.222
I'll run an EEG to determine
any brain activity.

04:55.684 --> 04:58.395
- What is it?
- Don't know.

05:02.315 --> 05:04.401
It's gate addresses, five of them.

05:04.568 --> 05:07.320
M7G-677. We've been to this planet.

05:07.487 --> 05:10.157
Dr Weir.

05:17.330 --> 05:19.416
Hello?

05:19.583 --> 05:22.669
Can you hear me?

05:22.836 --> 05:25.297
Yeah, that's what I was afraid of.

05:25.463 --> 05:28.175
- Freezer burn.
- I thought she wasn't frozen.

05:28.341 --> 05:30.719
10,000 years.
You expect her to dance a jig?

05:30.886 --> 05:33.263
It's the eyes. You look at the eyes.

05:33.430 --> 05:38.059
Lights are on but nobody's home. Doesn't
take a medical professional to know...

05:38.226 --> 05:40.353
Of course she can see us.

05:42.939 --> 05:44.816
And hear us.

05:44.983 --> 05:47.527
Hello. How are you feeling?

05:54.075 --> 05:57.537
<i>- It worked.
- (McKay) What was that?</i>

05:57.704 --> 05:59.831
- "It worked."
- What does that mean?

05:59.998 --> 06:02.834
- I assume something worked.
- That's very sharp.

06:03.001 --> 06:05.086
Thank you.

06:08.340 --> 06:09.925
<i>(Weir) Hello?</i>

06:11.551 --> 06:15.722
She fell asleep. When she's more stable,
transfer her to the infirmary.

06:15.889 --> 06:18.558
And I want video on her at all times.

06:18.725 --> 06:21.311
We might not get
a second chance at anything.

06:21.478 --> 06:23.980
Let's hope we get a first, huh?

06:27.067 --> 06:33.073
<i>- (Sheppard) Too big, huh?
- I'm just pointing out its dimensions.</i>

06:33.240 --> 06:35.492
- It's not that big...
- Gentlemen.

06:35.659 --> 06:39.746
We were wondering if there were
any other frozen bodies out there.

06:39.913 --> 06:41.832
There's no way of knowing.

06:41.998 --> 06:46.628
It'd be like searching every room
in Manhattan. It'll take a while.

06:46.795 --> 06:50.423
God knows what other surprises
are not showing on the sensors.

06:50.590 --> 06:53.969
<i>- That's what we're here to find out.
- (Beckett) Dr Weir.</i>

06:54.136 --> 06:56.680
<i>- Yes?
- You'd better come to the infirmary.</i>

06:56.847 --> 07:00.600
- Is our patient awake?
- Aye, and she's saying peculiar things.

07:00.767 --> 07:02.853
On our way.

07:11.862 --> 07:15.282
She's drifting in and out, still very weak.

07:15.448 --> 07:19.411
But there's something
a wee bit odd about this woman.

07:19.578 --> 07:23.248
She called me Carson.
She knows my name.

07:23.415 --> 07:26.334
- She overheard you talking to someone.
- No.

07:26.501 --> 07:29.713
- I was alone here when she woke up.
- Subconsciously?

07:29.880 --> 07:32.424
I've read stories of coma patients...

07:32.591 --> 07:35.719
It's more than that. She knows things.

07:48.231 --> 07:50.192
How are you feeling?

07:50.358 --> 07:52.444
Look at you!

07:53.904 --> 07:56.823
I didn't think I'd see any of you again.

08:00.035 --> 08:03.663
Missed you all so terribly.

08:06.082 --> 08:09.711
- Even you, Rodney.
- You see?

08:12.297 --> 08:14.883
I'm sorry? Do we know you?

08:15.050 --> 08:17.135
Oh, yes.

08:19.387 --> 08:22.390
I'm you, Elizabeth.

08:29.481 --> 08:31.566
<i>- Time travel?
- That's what she said.</i>

08:31.733 --> 08:35.236
She somehow found a way
to travel back in time

08:35.403 --> 08:37.739
to when the Ancients inhabited the city.

08:37.905 --> 08:41.034
How did she do this?

08:41.201 --> 08:44.287
That will be the first question
when she wakes up.

08:44.454 --> 08:49.751
- If she ever wakes up.
- There is the possibility she might be...

08:49.918 --> 08:53.046
What is the clinical term... nuts?

08:53.880 --> 08:59.010
She may be senile, yes, but that doesn't
explain how she knows so much about us.

08:59.177 --> 09:01.847
Is time travel even possible?

09:02.013 --> 09:05.934
There's nothing in the laws of physics
to prevent it.

09:06.101 --> 09:07.978
Extremely difficult to achieve.

09:08.145 --> 09:11.439
You need to manipulate black holes
to create wormholes

09:11.606 --> 09:13.859
through points in space and time.

09:14.025 --> 09:18.155
- Not to mention a nice DeLorean.
- Don't get me started on that movie.

09:18.321 --> 09:20.824
I like that movie.

09:22.409 --> 09:26.705
The results of the DNA test. It's a match.

09:29.666 --> 09:31.376
She is you.

09:42.262 --> 09:44.806
I know what you're thinking.

09:44.973 --> 09:48.393
If she's been waiting
all these millennia for us to arrive,

09:48.560 --> 09:52.564
why didn't the system attempt
to revive her the moment we got here?

09:52.731 --> 09:56.860
Answer: It did. I've been going over
the data from our arrival.

09:57.027 --> 09:59.571
One thing we noticed
was a sudden power surge

09:59.738 --> 10:02.115
in the section where the stasis lab was.

10:02.282 --> 10:05.202
It was trying to revive her,
only we didn't know.

10:05.368 --> 10:09.039
We saw more power draining
from an already nearly depleted ZPM,

10:09.206 --> 10:14.377
so we shut down all secondary systems,
almost killed her... you.

10:15.420 --> 10:20.300
- How weird is that, huh?
- Very. Very, very weird.

10:23.762 --> 10:25.847
Looking at yourself...

10:26.848 --> 10:28.934
how you will be.

10:29.100 --> 10:33.730
Actually, how you will be
will be different than how she is right now.

10:33.897 --> 10:37.776
The moment she went back in time,
she created a separate reality,

10:37.943 --> 10:41.530
a second you living in a parallel world.

10:41.696 --> 10:44.825
According to one interpretation
of quantum theory.

10:44.991 --> 10:47.911
Simply put, this interpretation states that

10:48.078 --> 10:52.290
the universe is split into
an infinite number of copies of itself

10:52.457 --> 10:58.255
in which every possible outcome to every
decision ever made all exists somewhere.

11:01.299 --> 11:03.969
- Simply put.
- Yeah, in a nutshell.

11:05.095 --> 11:07.180
Elizabeth?

11:11.059 --> 11:13.145
There's so much to tell you.

11:15.939 --> 11:19.151
- The note... I had a note.
- Yes.

11:19.317 --> 11:21.194
Yes, we got your note.

11:21.361 --> 11:25.615
Forgive my bluntness, but we need
to know everything about your encounter,

11:25.782 --> 11:30.787
beginning when you went back in time,
specifically how you went back...

11:30.954 --> 11:34.291
Rodney... let me talk.

11:35.667 --> 11:38.170
Yeah.

11:39.296 --> 11:41.715
There was an accident.

11:41.882 --> 11:45.719
I remember
we arrived through the Stargate.

11:47.721 --> 11:51.516
<i>(Old Weir)
The lights came on by themselves...</i>

11:53.518 --> 11:55.604
<i>...sensing our presence.</i>

11:55.770 --> 11:57.939
Who's doing that?

11:58.106 --> 12:00.942
<i>The city slowly awoke.</i>

12:04.654 --> 12:07.449
Dr Weir, you have to see this.

12:07.616 --> 12:11.870
There are a lot of things I have to see.
Just be careful.

12:17.250 --> 12:20.712
This is the control room.
Obviously their version of a DHD.

12:20.879 --> 12:23.423
<i>- Obviously (!)
- Power control systems.</i>

12:23.590 --> 12:26.426
- A computer interface.
- Why don't you find out?

12:26.593 --> 12:29.471
We've got lights coming on, air circulating,

12:29.638 --> 12:32.474
but no power coming on
to these consoles.

12:32.641 --> 12:35.644
<i>(McKay) Wait.
That isn't the way it happened.</i>

12:35.811 --> 12:40.315
Everything came online when we arrived.
Lights, computers, power systems.

12:40.482 --> 12:46.154
- I accessed the database immediately.
- That's not what happened.

12:46.321 --> 12:49.032
Not the first time.

13:00.335 --> 13:05.465
- Isn't there something you can give her?
- She's in an extremely fragile state.

13:05.632 --> 13:08.260
Her blood pressure is low,
her heart is weak.

13:08.426 --> 13:14.432
If I administer a stimulant, it may induce
a dangerous arrhythmia, or worse.

13:15.517 --> 13:19.688
Just enough to keep her alert
for a few more minutes at a time.

13:19.855 --> 13:23.525
We hardly get a couple of words out of her
before she dozes off.

13:23.692 --> 13:28.196
Which, I might remind you,
is not uncommon for a woman of 10,000.

13:32.576 --> 13:35.829
Carson, I understand your reticence,

13:35.996 --> 13:41.001
but trust me when I say
I believe she can handle it,

13:41.168 --> 13:44.004
and I know she'd want it.

13:47.382 --> 13:49.468
OK.

13:59.978 --> 14:02.314
It's OK, Carson.

14:02.481 --> 14:05.942
I'm just as freaked out
about all this as you are.

14:11.031 --> 14:13.742
How's our patient doing?

14:14.826 --> 14:20.248
Pressure's improving and, as you can tell,
she's much more alert.

14:20.415 --> 14:23.793
Are you up for getting outta here?

14:44.523 --> 14:50.654
Seeing the city like this,
sitting on the surface of the ocean,

14:50.821 --> 14:54.533
you can't imagine how relieved I am.

14:54.699 --> 14:58.829
What are you saying?
The city didn't rise the first time round?

14:58.995 --> 15:01.498
No. No.

15:02.749 --> 15:08.171
The city was in serious trouble
the very moment we arrived.

15:08.338 --> 15:11.049
With temporary battery power,

15:11.216 --> 15:15.345
we're trying to access
the city's main power systems.

15:15.512 --> 15:20.517
<i>Dr Weir, Colonel Sumner. Can you
come down here? We're three levels down.</i>

15:20.684 --> 15:23.770
- Right away.
- How we doing over there?

15:23.937 --> 15:27.566
- Nothing yet.
- Let's see what we can do.

15:27.732 --> 15:31.111
We've only secured
a fraction of the place. It's huge.

15:31.278 --> 15:35.240
- It might really be the lost city of Atlantis?
- That's a good bet.

15:35.407 --> 15:37.492
Oh, my God!

15:43.290 --> 15:44.958
We're underwater.

15:45.125 --> 15:49.754
<i>(Sumner) I'd say we're under
several hundred feet of ocean.</i>

15:54.509 --> 15:56.595
<i>(Sumner) This could be a problem.</i>

15:59.473 --> 16:01.558
Oh, no!

16:02.726 --> 16:05.979
<i>Dr Weir, I need to see you
in the control room immediately.</i>

16:09.483 --> 16:13.111
The city has a shield,
a force field holding the water back.

16:13.278 --> 16:16.907
Or it had a shield. Power systems
are nearing maximum entropy.

16:17.073 --> 16:19.951
Our arrival hastened
their depletion big time.

16:20.118 --> 16:24.623
The shield is collapsing rapidly. Several
sections of the city are already flooded.

16:24.789 --> 16:29.628
- Can we use our own power generators?
- We probably don't have time to try.

16:29.795 --> 16:33.673
When I say rapidly collapsing,
I mean rapidly.

16:34.633 --> 16:37.302
Colonel Sumner,
order all your security teams

16:37.469 --> 16:42.098
to stop searching the city and fall back
to the gate room immediately.

16:43.266 --> 16:47.979
<i>- Sumner, do you copy?
- (shouting and rushing water)</i>

16:55.403 --> 16:58.114
Colonel Sumner drowned?

17:02.536 --> 17:05.664
And he wasn't the only one to perish.

17:06.705 --> 17:09.209
We should evacuate through the Stargate.

17:09.376 --> 17:13.713
We can't. Power's been diverted
to the shield holding the ocean back.

17:13.880 --> 17:16.508
Do we know why this is happening now?

17:16.675 --> 17:19.719
Power consumption spiked
when we arrived.

17:19.886 --> 17:22.472
- This is happening because we arrived?
- Yes.

17:22.638 --> 17:27.394
- What about auxiliary power?
- I'll interface with one of our generators.

17:27.560 --> 17:31.940
Grodin, see if you can locate
any gate addresses in the database.

17:32.107 --> 17:36.736
There won't be enough power to get back
to Earth, but maybe enough for Pegasus.

17:37.863 --> 17:40.699
Some of our team
discovered a bay full of ships.

17:40.866 --> 17:43.243
Spaceships? We should check 'em out.

17:43.410 --> 17:46.288
- You could figure out...?
- I can fly anything.

17:46.454 --> 17:48.540
Good. Go.

17:51.710 --> 17:54.171
<i>(rumbling)</i>

18:04.764 --> 18:07.767
- I'll start with this one.
- What am I looking for?

18:07.934 --> 18:10.479
See how many people they can fit.

18:13.148 --> 18:17.611
Two piers are almost entirely flooded,
the third about to collapse.

18:17.777 --> 18:21.490
<i>(Sheppard) Dr Weir, these ships
can hold several people each.</i>

18:21.656 --> 18:24.242
<i>Learning how to fly 'em is another matter.</i>

18:24.409 --> 18:26.620
I'll see if I can pull up a schematic.

18:26.786 --> 18:29.664
<i>- This ship is different than the others.
- How?</i>

18:29.831 --> 18:33.543
<i>It's a different control console.
Zelenka's on his way over.</i>

18:33.710 --> 18:35.962
- Good. I'm on my way too.
- Oh, no!

18:36.129 --> 18:39.090
- What's wrong?
- The city's in self-protect mode.

18:39.257 --> 18:42.010
Bulkheads are slamming shut.
People are trapped.

18:42.177 --> 18:45.931
- Wouldn't that protect them?
- Most rooms are already breached.

18:46.097 --> 18:48.934
We've got people trapped
with water rising.

18:49.100 --> 18:55.816
I'll try to override the system, but it could
hamper efforts to power the Stargate.

18:59.444 --> 19:03.865
If these ships are our only way out,
don't wait too long to get to the bay.

19:06.493 --> 19:09.663
- Rodney!
- Yes, yes, yes. I heard. Go.

19:16.253 --> 19:18.839
- How are we doing?
- This ship is different.

19:19.005 --> 19:22.008
- What does it do?
- I don't know. I need more time.

19:22.175 --> 19:24.803
You don't have time!
It's airtight, I assume?

19:24.970 --> 19:29.099
<i>- It's a spaceship. It better be.
- (McKay) I've located a roof hatch.</i>

19:29.266 --> 19:31.852
<i>- I'll try to get it open.
- (clanging)</i>

19:32.018 --> 19:34.271
What was that?

19:34.437 --> 19:37.607
Bulkhead doors have slammed shut.
We're locked in!

19:37.774 --> 19:40.318
<i>- (Weir) Can you get it open?
- I'm trying!</i>

19:54.416 --> 19:56.543
Forget it! The gate room's flooding.

19:56.710 --> 19:59.337
Get up here! We're waiting for you!

19:59.504 --> 20:03.049
I'm trying to retract the roof.
As soon as it opens, you go.

20:03.216 --> 20:05.886
<i>- Rodney!
- There's no time to argue.</i>

20:06.052 --> 20:10.432
Catastrophic failure is imminent.
Just lock yourself in and go.

20:12.392 --> 20:15.145
<i>(Old Weir) There was nothing
you could do.</i>

20:16.730 --> 20:19.566
Within seconds
the control room was flooded.

20:21.902 --> 20:23.778
I died?

20:23.945 --> 20:28.116
You never gave up trying,
right until the end.

20:33.955 --> 20:38.877
Well... a man wonders
how he would choose to go out,

20:39.044 --> 20:41.963
given such dire circumstances.

20:42.130 --> 20:46.593
- Now I know.
- Trying to save the lives of others.

20:46.760 --> 20:49.262
But ultimately failing.

20:50.722 --> 20:53.850
- I'm sure if I had a few more seconds...
- Wait.

20:54.017 --> 20:57.646
Why didn't the failsafe mechanism engage
and raise the city?

20:57.813 --> 21:01.316
Because there was
no failsafe the first time.

21:01.483 --> 21:04.486
Atlantis remained on the ocean floor.

21:04.653 --> 21:07.322
The shield completely collapsed.

21:07.489 --> 21:13.495
Water came crashing in,
flooding every room in the city.

21:16.039 --> 21:21.128
You both drowned while attempting
to get our people into ships.

21:23.338 --> 21:29.094
And we, along with Dr Zelenka,
we found ourselves trapped.

21:29.261 --> 21:32.389
We need to get outta here!

21:38.812 --> 21:41.898
- Did McKay get the hatch open?
- I do not know.

21:42.065 --> 21:46.236
<i>(Ford) There's six of us stuck
in one of the ships! What do we do?</i>

21:46.945 --> 21:49.781
- What did you do?
- I think I just turned it on.

21:49.948 --> 21:51.825
Stand by, Sergeant.

21:51.992 --> 21:56.580
I'm not much for instruction manuals,
but I could use one right about now.

22:02.419 --> 22:06.339
- Oh, my God!
- We're in space. What happened?

22:06.506 --> 22:10.510
- Now what did you do?
- I don't know. I just...

22:12.387 --> 22:15.056
What was that?

22:19.436 --> 22:25.692
We were under attack. We didn't know
where we were or who was shooting at us.

22:27.527 --> 22:29.613
And that's when John...

22:31.531 --> 22:35.577
- Carson!
- I need medical assistance asap.

22:46.630 --> 22:48.507
How's she doing?

22:48.673 --> 22:52.928
Stabilised, but still very weak,
and getting weaker.

22:53.762 --> 22:57.849
<i>(Sheppard) Your own mortality
staring you right in the face.</i>

22:58.767 --> 23:01.895
I can't imagine how you must be feeling.

23:04.022 --> 23:06.316
When she looks at me,

23:06.483 --> 23:10.862
it's as if she's sensing my thoughts,

23:11.029 --> 23:14.074
and I'm sensing hers.

23:14.241 --> 23:16.326
It's very unsettling.

23:16.493 --> 23:19.830
Just when you thought
this place couldn't get any weirder.

23:19.996 --> 23:23.750
The puddle jumper they escaped in
must have been a time machine,

23:23.917 --> 23:26.128
had to have an additional component.

23:26.294 --> 23:28.964
- Flux capacitor.
- Yeah.

23:29.131 --> 23:33.218
The question is,
where's the time machine now, hmm?

23:34.594 --> 23:37.305
<i>(Weir) Why don't we ask her?</i>

23:40.725 --> 23:42.936
What happened?

23:43.103 --> 23:47.899
Can you tell us? The ship
that you escaped in, where is it now?

23:50.652 --> 23:52.320
It's gone.

23:55.699 --> 23:59.077
- Who is shooting at us?
- How do we shoot back?

24:06.877 --> 24:09.379
Did I do that?

24:12.090 --> 24:14.468
Hang on!

24:15.886 --> 24:17.971
The next thing I knew...

24:20.056 --> 24:22.142
...I woke up here.

24:22.309 --> 24:24.811
You mean now?

24:26.313 --> 24:29.691
No. Then.

24:34.362 --> 24:36.239
You're awake.

24:36.406 --> 24:39.159
<i>(Old Weir) His name was Janus.</i>

24:39.326 --> 24:41.870
<i>He healed my wounds</i>

24:42.037 --> 24:44.748
<i>and explained to me what had happened.</i>

24:44.915 --> 24:47.709
Your ship was shot down.

24:47.876 --> 24:51.004
We retrieved it from the ocean floor.

24:52.339 --> 24:54.466
Major Sheppard, Dr Zelenka?

24:54.633 --> 24:57.177
No one survived.

24:59.846 --> 25:03.892
Ha! Ah, the bitter taste
of ultimate failure, hmm?

25:04.059 --> 25:08.605
If you'd figured out how to fix the damn
shield, none of us would have died.

25:08.772 --> 25:11.691
I valiantly attempted to save your sorry...

25:11.858 --> 25:14.444
Gentlemen. Focus.

25:17.781 --> 25:20.283
Please, continue.

25:21.368 --> 25:24.746
Needless to say, I was very confused.

25:26.164 --> 25:30.168
He explained to me
that the ship we had escaped in

25:30.335 --> 25:33.421
was a time machine.

25:33.588 --> 25:36.216
He was the one who built it.

25:36.383 --> 25:41.429
After I was feeling better, he brought me
before the Atlantean Council.

25:41.596 --> 25:44.224
We welcome you to the city of Atlantis.

25:44.391 --> 25:45.851
Thank you.

25:46.017 --> 25:49.563
Your arrival has come
at a time of great conflict.

25:49.729 --> 25:54.693
We've been under siege and have
submerged our city for protection.

25:54.860 --> 25:59.322
Yes, it's how we found the city
when we came through the Stargate.

25:59.489 --> 26:02.200
- From Earth?
- Yes.

26:02.367 --> 26:04.786
10,000 years from now.

26:07.247 --> 26:10.250
It should be noted that our actions

26:10.417 --> 26:14.504
have succeeded in protecting the city
for so many years.

26:14.671 --> 26:18.425
Let us hope Dr Weir's arrival
has not altered this eventuality.

26:18.592 --> 26:22.179
By encountering the Wraith,
she may have already set in motion

26:22.345 --> 26:26.641
events that could lead to a future
far different from the one she left.

26:26.808 --> 26:30.562
I'm sorry. What are the Wraith?

26:30.729 --> 26:34.649
They told me of beings called Wraiths,

26:34.816 --> 26:37.819
a vicious, formidable enemy

26:37.986 --> 26:40.780
whose power and technology
rivalled their own.

26:40.947 --> 26:43.200
Yes, actually, we've already...

26:43.366 --> 26:46.203
The Atlanteans sent a delegation,

26:46.369 --> 26:50.123
protected by
their most powerful warships,

26:50.290 --> 26:53.210
in the faint hope of negotiating a truce.

26:53.376 --> 26:57.714
One on one, the Atlantean ships
were more powerful,

26:57.881 --> 27:00.258
but the Wraith were so many.

27:00.425 --> 27:06.598
After that great battle...
it was only a matter of time.

27:06.765 --> 27:11.853
We're awaiting our offworld transport
ships before beginning our evacuation.

27:12.020 --> 27:15.106
- Where will you go?
- We're returning to Earth.

27:15.273 --> 27:17.984
You're welcome to join us.

27:19.194 --> 27:22.197
Thank you. That's very kind, but...

27:22.364 --> 27:28.411
I'm sure you must understand my desire
to return to the future, to my people.

27:28.578 --> 27:31.748
I was hoping to be able
to use the time machine again

27:31.915 --> 27:36.837
and programme it to arrive at the moment
we came through the Stargate,

27:37.003 --> 27:40.048
and if you had a ZPM
I could take back with me,

27:40.215 --> 27:42.300
that would help us considerably.

27:42.467 --> 27:45.929
- The power systems were depleted...
- No.

27:47.222 --> 27:50.350
Enough of this tampering with time.

27:50.517 --> 27:54.813
- Causality is not to be treated lightly.
- No one's treating it lightly.

27:54.980 --> 27:59.025
You are, with your insistence
on continuing these experiments,

27:59.192 --> 28:01.987
despite the condemnation of this Council.

28:02.154 --> 28:05.782
We ordered you to cease these activities
and yet here we sit,

28:05.949 --> 28:09.327
face to face with a visitor from the future,

28:09.494 --> 28:13.623
who arrived here in the very machine
you agreed not to construct.

28:14.791 --> 28:18.211
We are about to evacuate this city

28:18.378 --> 28:21.506
in the hope that it will lie safe
for many years

28:21.673 --> 28:24.301
and then, one day, our kind will return.

28:25.969 --> 28:28.346
And they have.

28:28.513 --> 28:31.975
Because of my experiments,
we now have the opportunity...

28:32.142 --> 28:35.812
Enough! We have no time for this.

28:38.773 --> 28:43.028
I'm hereby ordering the destruction
of this time-travel device

28:43.195 --> 28:46.406
and all the materials
connected with its design.

28:49.618 --> 28:53.205
You are welcome to return to Earth
with our people.

28:53.371 --> 28:55.916
You shall not be returning to yours.

29:10.305 --> 29:16.311
The tests confirm her skeletal, muscular,
circulatory and neuroendocrine systems

29:16.478 --> 29:18.647
have all been decimated by age.

29:18.814 --> 29:23.819
I'm seeing renal failure, liver failure
and evidence of a stroke.

29:23.985 --> 29:27.864
- How long does she have?
- I doubt she'll live out the night.

29:28.031 --> 29:29.825
Please.

29:30.909 --> 29:33.745
I don't know how much time I have left

29:33.912 --> 29:37.374
to tell the story
I have waited so long to tell.

29:40.377 --> 29:41.962
Oh...

29:42.129 --> 29:46.383
The Council, they were very upset.

29:46.550 --> 29:49.636
You said they decided
to destroy the time machine.

29:49.803 --> 29:54.266
I tried to talk them out of it.
I didn't give up hope.

29:55.809 --> 29:57.894
Thankfully, I had an ally.

29:58.061 --> 30:02.732
You need to talk to Moros. Dr Weir was
brought here through no fault of her own.

30:02.899 --> 30:06.361
- She shouldn't be punished.
- She's free to come to Earth.

30:06.528 --> 30:10.282
She needs to return to her time,
not remain in ours.

30:10.448 --> 30:14.828
That's not possible. I'm sorry.

30:14.995 --> 30:19.291
Wait. I don't think you understand
how far we've come,

30:19.458 --> 30:23.086
or how much my people have sacrificed
in the hopes of meeting you.

30:24.504 --> 30:29.259
We call you the Ancients,
the gate builders.

30:29.426 --> 30:33.597
We've crossed galaxies in the hopes
of finding a great people.

30:33.763 --> 30:37.017
Please, is there no other way
you can help?

30:39.352 --> 30:42.898
We could block the Stargate permanently
after the evacuation.

30:43.064 --> 30:45.817
That way, your team
will be unable to come here.

30:45.984 --> 30:48.653
The city may never be found.

30:48.820 --> 30:52.532
- But their lives would be saved.
- Thank you for your offer.

30:52.699 --> 30:57.370
But we are explorers, just like you.

30:58.538 --> 31:00.624
Which should come as no surprise,

31:00.791 --> 31:03.794
since they are the second evolution
of our kind.

31:05.378 --> 31:10.550
Don't you understand?
This city will survive 10,000 years.

31:16.890 --> 31:20.018
The Council's decision is final.

31:26.399 --> 31:30.111
Of course,
Janus refused to concede defeat.

31:31.196 --> 31:35.951
The more someone told him not
to do something, the more he had to do it.

31:36.117 --> 31:41.331
So he came up with an alternate plan
behind the Council's back.

31:43.333 --> 31:46.795
It was all I could do
to try to keep pace with him.

31:56.429 --> 31:58.890
May I ask what it is you're doing?

31:59.057 --> 32:01.351
Calculating the necessary power needed.

32:01.518 --> 32:06.690
- Needed for...?
- The shield collapsed after your arrival.

32:06.857 --> 32:10.152
I have to find a way
to extend the supply of power.

32:14.364 --> 32:18.702
- What is it you called them?
- ZPM. Zero-point module.

32:18.869 --> 32:20.954
Yes.

32:22.164 --> 32:27.002
They operate in parallel, providing power
to the city simultaneously.

32:27.169 --> 32:30.589
However, used in sequence,
it may be possible

32:30.755 --> 32:34.301
to sustain the necessary power
for the needed time.

32:36.470 --> 32:39.097
<i>(Old Weir) I couldn't believe my eyes.</i>

32:39.264 --> 32:43.435
<i>Three ZPMs right in front of me.</i>

32:43.602 --> 32:47.772
There is one small problem, however.

32:47.939 --> 32:53.028
Someone will need to remain to transfer
the power from one device to the other,

32:53.195 --> 32:56.198
to rotate them sequentially.

32:56.364 --> 33:00.243
- Over thousands of years?
- It is possible.

33:02.954 --> 33:06.500
<i>(Council member)
Janus, please report to Central Control.</i>

33:07.292 --> 33:12.631
Their transport ship was inbound.
It was taking heavy fire.

33:16.426 --> 33:20.013
<i>(inbound ship) Cloaking shields damaged.
We're returning fire.</i>

33:20.180 --> 33:23.225
- There's too many enemy ships.
- And more coming.

33:23.391 --> 33:25.977
Engage auxiliary power.
Try to outrun them.

33:26.144 --> 33:29.773
<i>(shouting and explosions)</i>

33:29.940 --> 33:34.528
There are over 300 people
on that transport.

33:34.694 --> 33:36.696
<i>The shields are down!</i>

33:36.863 --> 33:38.448
<i>(shouting)</i>

33:38.615 --> 33:41.117
<i>(big explosion)</i>

33:43.370 --> 33:46.998
Begin evacuation. We must leave now.

34:19.614 --> 34:22.242
Damn. Fell asleep again.

34:22.409 --> 34:24.911
Well, you're not the only one.

34:27.496 --> 34:31.835
- Are you in any pain?
- Would we admit it if we were?

34:35.045 --> 34:38.091
I wish there was more
we could do for you.

34:38.257 --> 34:40.427
Look at you.

34:40.594 --> 34:45.139
Always worrying.
You put too much pressure on yourself.

34:46.433 --> 34:50.896
Remember that miserable
Baltic negotiation?

34:52.105 --> 34:54.733
What Simon told us afterwards?

34:54.900 --> 34:58.904
"Breathe", among other things.

35:00.614 --> 35:05.076
Enjoy the moment, what's here right now.

35:06.536 --> 35:09.831
The sun... the breeze.

35:12.250 --> 35:14.211
Our birthday.

35:16.213 --> 35:18.924
Sheppard couldn't keep it to himself, huh?

35:20.217 --> 35:23.345
I'm just saying stop being
so damn hard on yourself.

35:27.599 --> 35:29.559
Life is quick.

35:30.852 --> 35:35.524
- Not for you.
- It was my choice, Elizabeth.

35:35.690 --> 35:41.905
I didn't second-guess it then,
and I don't regret it now.

35:55.127 --> 35:59.047
- Where is Dr Weir?
- She's gone through the gate.

35:59.214 --> 36:01.508
She was among the first to evacuate.

36:01.675 --> 36:03.760
Good.

36:19.067 --> 36:22.737
<i>(Old Weir) Janus prepared
the stasis chamber for me,</i>

36:22.904 --> 36:26.575
<i>said it would be like
a deep, dreamless sleep.</i>

36:26.741 --> 36:29.703
I'm inputting commands
for the system to revive you

36:29.870 --> 36:33.415
at intervals of 3.3 thousand years
to rotate the ZPMs.

36:33.582 --> 36:37.502
I'll give you instructions
on how to reactivate the stasis process.

36:37.669 --> 36:40.380
I'm entering commands
to commence final revival

36:40.547 --> 36:45.010
the moment sensors indicate
the presence of your... expedition team.

36:46.386 --> 36:51.516
Look, I feel that I must tell you
that there is a possibility,

36:51.683 --> 36:55.312
remote as it is,
that this might not succeed.

36:56.563 --> 36:57.939
I know.

36:58.106 --> 37:00.650
It's impossible to predict what'll happen.

37:00.817 --> 37:02.986
I'm convinced that you will survive.

37:05.614 --> 37:10.911
But if you don't, I've programmed
a failsafe mechanism to protect the city.

37:11.077 --> 37:13.038
- A failsafe?
- Yes.

37:13.205 --> 37:17.584
If the power drains, the mechanism
holding the city will release

37:17.751 --> 37:20.879
and it will rise to the surface.

37:21.046 --> 37:22.422
Really?

37:25.759 --> 37:28.678
<i>(Old Weir) And then they left, all of them,</i>

37:28.845 --> 37:31.556
<i>returning to Earth through the Stargate.</i>

37:39.147 --> 37:41.441
What's all that?

37:41.608 --> 37:44.236
My research.

37:44.402 --> 37:46.613
You're gonna build another time ship.

37:46.780 --> 37:49.616
Doubt I'll succeed.
The Council will be watching.

37:49.783 --> 37:52.202
I'm sure you'll find a way.

37:55.205 --> 37:59.709
I've blocked all addresses
to the gate except Earth. You will be safe.

38:02.045 --> 38:04.798
- Thank you.
- Thank you...

38:04.965 --> 38:09.386
for giving me the hope that Atlantis
will survive another 10,000 years

38:09.553 --> 38:12.264
after you discover it again.

38:36.037 --> 38:38.123
I'm ready.

38:56.141 --> 38:58.643
<i>(Old Weir) And then I was alone.</i>

39:26.421 --> 39:28.924
I set the city to slumber...

39:59.913 --> 40:04.084
...and began my long journey home.

40:10.423 --> 40:14.886
It worked... the stasis, the failsafe.

40:16.429 --> 40:18.932
You gave up your entire life.

40:20.517 --> 40:24.771
No, because we are the same person.

40:25.772 --> 40:30.152
The best part of my life is just beginning.

40:30.318 --> 40:33.280
I'm exploring a new galaxy.

40:37.492 --> 40:40.328
I have years ahead of me still.

40:46.209 --> 40:48.712
Trust yourself, Elizabeth.

40:51.047 --> 40:55.177
All that matters is right now.

41:00.015 --> 41:04.811
And the note,
I wrote it in case I didn't survive.

41:05.395 --> 41:07.564
Has Rodney figured it out yet?

41:08.440 --> 41:12.694
- Five gate addresses.
- Outposts.

41:12.861 --> 41:17.699
Each one with a zero-point module.

41:19.159 --> 41:21.244
Janus told me.

41:23.205 --> 41:28.418
The note she left, it's coordinates
of planets to have known ZPMs.

41:32.547 --> 41:37.469
<i>- (Sheppard) They could still be there.
- (McKay) M7G-677! We've got...</i>

42:28.228 --> 42:31.815
We're about to start
our mission briefing, so...

42:31.982 --> 42:34.067
I'll be right there.

42:36.403 --> 42:41.199
Actually, John...
give me a minute, will you?

42:42.117 --> 42:44.202
Sure.
