WEBVTT

00:03.542 --> 00:05.628
You have something I want.

00:09.048 --> 00:10.925
It means more to me

00:12.885 --> 00:14.845
than you will ever know.

00:16.347 --> 00:17.598
THE MANDALORIAN: The Child is gone.

00:17.681 --> 00:20.684
Until he is returned to you safely,
we are in your debt.

00:23.062 --> 00:25.523
THE MANDALORIAN: Cara Dune,
Marshal of the New Republic.

00:26.065 --> 00:28.943
I need you to locate someone
in the prison registry.

00:29.527 --> 00:32.279
Ex-Imperial sharpshooter,
last name Mayfeld.

00:32.363 --> 00:34.865
Serving 50 years
in the Karthon Chop Fields.

00:35.324 --> 00:37.785
Accessory to the death
of a New Republic officer.

00:37.868 --> 00:39.662
Get that blaster out of my face, Mando!

00:39.745 --> 00:41.747
THE MANDALORIAN: Realize
what you'll bring down on us?

00:41.830 --> 00:42.957
You think I care about that?

00:43.040 --> 00:45.459
-Get that blaster out of my face.
-THE MANDALORIAN: I can't do that.

00:49.505 --> 00:50.506
Crazy Twi.

00:56.971 --> 00:57.972
No!

02:01.994 --> 02:03.871
DROID: Inmate three-four-six-six-seven.

02:05.956 --> 02:07.791
Inmate three-four-six-six-seven.

02:07.875 --> 02:10.461
What? What?

02:11.462 --> 02:15.174
DROID: Inmate three-four-six-six-seven,
descend and receive new instructions.

02:22.431 --> 02:23.891
Can't you see I'm busy?

02:23.974 --> 02:26.227
Inmate three-four-six-six-seven,

02:26.310 --> 02:29.021
please salute Marshal Dune.

02:32.149 --> 02:35.236
I remand prisoner number
three-four-six-six-seven to my custody.

02:36.237 --> 02:38.781
Affirmative.
Inmate three-four-six-six-seven,

02:38.864 --> 02:41.242
please follow Marshal Dune to transport.

02:42.076 --> 02:45.412
-Somebody gonna tell me what's going on?
-Let's go! I've got a job for you.

02:48.040 --> 02:50.960
DROID: Inmate three-four-six-six-seven,
please follow Marshal Dune.

02:51.043 --> 02:52.419
Wait, where is she takin' me?

02:52.503 --> 02:53.879
Inmate three-four-six-six-seven,

02:53.963 --> 02:57.550
you have three seconds
to comply with your new directive.

02:57.633 --> 02:59.510
Okay! All right, all right.

03:00.636 --> 03:01.637
Hey!

03:02.805 --> 03:04.890
You gonna tell me where you're takin' me?

03:05.933 --> 03:06.934
Hello?

03:09.603 --> 03:11.772
I mean, it's a common courtesy,

03:11.856 --> 03:15.234
a common courtesy to tell somebody
where it is that you're takin' 'em.

03:15.317 --> 03:17.695
I don't think
that's so hard to ask, do you?

03:21.031 --> 03:22.032
Oh.

03:22.116 --> 03:24.743
You know, for a second,
I thought you were this other guy.

03:36.505 --> 03:37.756
THE MANDALORIAN: Mayfeld.

03:38.340 --> 03:40.301
Hey, Mando.

03:41.635 --> 03:42.761
Long time.

03:44.054 --> 03:45.472
What, you came here to kill me?

03:45.556 --> 03:48.809
All you need to know is I bent
a lot of rules to bring you along.

03:50.102 --> 03:51.103
Why am I so lucky?

03:51.687 --> 03:52.897
Because you're Imperial.

03:52.980 --> 03:55.024
Hey, that was a long time ago, all right?

03:55.107 --> 03:57.109
THE MANDALORIAN: You still know
your Imperial clearances

03:57.193 --> 03:59.111
and protocols, don't you?

04:40.653 --> 04:43.113
We need coordinates
for Moff Gideon's cruiser.

04:44.114 --> 04:45.407
Moff Gideon?

04:45.491 --> 04:46.909
Yeah, forget it.

04:46.992 --> 04:49.453
Just take me back to the scrapyard.
I'm not doin' that.

04:49.537 --> 04:50.746
They have his kid.

04:52.289 --> 04:53.374
The little green guy?

04:53.457 --> 04:55.626
Yeah, "The little green guy."

04:56.544 --> 04:57.545
So...

04:59.964 --> 05:02.383
I help you guys get him back,
you guys let me go?

05:03.259 --> 05:04.927
That's not how this works.

05:05.010 --> 05:06.679
Well, then what's in it for me?

05:06.762 --> 05:08.180
You get a better view.

05:12.518 --> 05:15.104
All right, but here's the thing.
I can't get those coordinates

05:15.187 --> 05:17.940
unless I have access
to an internal Imperial terminal.

05:19.441 --> 05:20.901
I believe there's one on Morak.

05:20.985 --> 05:23.362
THE MANDALORIAN: Morak?
There's nothing on Morak.

05:23.445 --> 05:25.447
It's a secret Imperial mining hub, okay?

05:25.531 --> 05:28.826
If you can get me in there,
I can get you the coordinates.

05:32.955 --> 05:35.791
THE MANDALORIAN: Fett,
punch in the coordinates to Morak.

05:38.210 --> 05:39.336
BOBA FETT: Copy that.

05:44.425 --> 05:46.427
I did an initial scan of the planet.

05:47.511 --> 05:49.263
This is what you're talkin' about, right?

05:49.346 --> 05:51.473
Yeah, that's the refinery right there.

05:52.600 --> 05:54.602
Wonder what they're refining in there.

05:54.685 --> 05:59.356
Looks like rhydonium.
Highly volatile and explosive.

05:59.440 --> 06:02.484
Yeah, kinda like this one, huh.

06:05.779 --> 06:08.449
They have anti-aircraft cannons
protecting it.

06:08.532 --> 06:10.659
And a platoon of security forces.

06:11.118 --> 06:14.413
THE MANDALORIAN: So we go in quiet.
Let's go get a closer look.

06:31.847 --> 06:33.474
MAYFELD: I'm not gonna need long inside,

06:33.557 --> 06:36.894
so once I get the coordinates, you guys
gotta get me the hell out of there.

06:36.977 --> 06:39.438
BOBA FETT: You get to the roof.
I'll drop in and pull you out.

06:39.522 --> 06:42.566
All right. Mayfeld and I will swap out
for the drivers in the tunnel.

06:42.650 --> 06:45.319
As much as I'd like to take a road trip
with Rebel-dropper here,

06:45.402 --> 06:46.695
that's not gonna work.

06:46.779 --> 06:48.322
Oh, yeah? Why's that?

06:48.405 --> 06:51.659
Well, because these Remnant bases
are set up and run by ex-ISB.

06:52.243 --> 06:54.161
If you get scanned
and your genetic signature

06:54.245 --> 06:56.664
shows up on any New Republic register,

06:56.747 --> 06:59.166
you're gonna be detected,
and it's guns out.

06:59.250 --> 07:01.710
You sure do know
a lot about Imperial Remnants.

07:01.794 --> 07:04.046
If you wanna accuse me of something,
then just say it.

07:04.129 --> 07:06.257
THE MANDALORIAN: We don't have time.
Fennec will go.

07:06.340 --> 07:09.301
No, I'm wanted by the ISB.
I'll trip the alarm, too.

07:10.511 --> 07:11.512
THE MANDALORIAN: Fett?

07:11.595 --> 07:13.556
BOBA FETT: Let's just say
they might recognize my face.

07:13.639 --> 07:15.307
MAYFELD: Great, so it's me goin' in alone.

07:15.808 --> 07:16.809
CARA: No way.

07:16.892 --> 07:19.603
The minute he gets inside,
he'll tip 'em off. He'll be a hero.

07:19.687 --> 07:22.773
MAYFELD: Hey. This wasn't my idea.
I'm doin' you guys a favor.

07:22.857 --> 07:24.567
CARA: Deal's off.
I'm takin' him back.

07:26.318 --> 07:27.319
THE MANDALORIAN: I'll go.

07:27.403 --> 07:29.196
Hey, buddy,
I might be good at fast-talking,

07:29.280 --> 07:33.284
but I don't think I can explain away
a guy in a Mando suit to Imperial guards.

07:33.367 --> 07:35.202
So, unless
you're gonna take off that helmet,

07:35.286 --> 07:36.704
it's gonna be me goin' in alone.

07:37.371 --> 07:39.206
Or say goodbye
to your little green friend.

07:40.124 --> 07:41.876
THE MANDALORIAN: You're not going alone.

07:43.377 --> 07:44.587
I'm coming with you.

07:46.672 --> 07:48.382
But I won't be showing my face.

07:57.558 --> 08:00.978
PILOT 1: Refinery, this is Juggernaut Five
entering tunnel T-12.

08:01.061 --> 08:02.271
Copy that.

08:02.354 --> 08:04.857
Juggernaut Four has reached
the north exit. You're all clear.

08:22.208 --> 08:23.209
PILOT 1: What the...

08:34.386 --> 08:36.055
Oh, my God, this guy reeked.

08:36.847 --> 08:38.474
His gloves are still wet.

08:40.518 --> 08:41.519
Ugh!

08:44.271 --> 08:46.148
Look at this.

08:46.690 --> 08:48.817
Oh, the shame.

08:50.402 --> 08:52.780
Now, that right there
is worth the price of admission.

08:55.032 --> 08:57.451
Wish I could say it looked good on you,
but I'd be lying.

08:57.535 --> 08:59.620
Just make sure
you take out the rooftop gunners,

08:59.703 --> 09:01.330
or we're never getting out of here.

09:01.705 --> 09:02.831
We got you.

09:05.125 --> 09:07.628
THE MANDALORIAN:
Take care of this. Keep it safe.

09:07.711 --> 09:09.004
I will.

09:09.588 --> 09:11.757
Hey, guys. Still on the clock.

09:13.759 --> 09:15.636
What would they say on Mandalore?

09:17.137 --> 09:19.181
It's a shame
you're not comin' along with us.

09:19.265 --> 09:21.725
You got such a sunny disposition.

09:21.809 --> 09:24.103
Can't imagine how much fun you are
in one of these.

09:26.105 --> 09:27.147
What's goin' on here?

09:27.940 --> 09:30.526
Power coil, motivator...

09:30.609 --> 09:32.194
Oh, there we...

09:32.778 --> 09:35.155
-Ah, there we go. There we go!

09:35.823 --> 09:37.324
And we are off.

09:49.253 --> 09:50.254
Hey, how's it feel?

09:51.714 --> 09:52.715
Huh?

09:54.592 --> 09:57.011
I mean, c'mon, man,
you still get to wear a helmet, right?

10:00.014 --> 10:02.141
All right, you know what?
I'm takin' this thing off.

10:02.850 --> 10:04.310
I can't see anything.

10:06.353 --> 10:08.314
I don't know
how you people wear those things.

10:09.148 --> 10:11.525
And by "you people,"
I do mean Mandalorians.

10:32.880 --> 10:34.840
Phase one, complete. We're in.

10:35.382 --> 10:37.468
Copy. Standing by.

10:47.394 --> 10:48.604
Feels better when it's off.

11:12.878 --> 11:15.339
Juggernaut Four,
you're running hot.

11:15.422 --> 11:17.716
Be sure to watch
your cargo heat limits and speed.

11:17.800 --> 11:21.262
PILOT 3: Copy that, Three. We hit
a couple bumps. Thanks for the heads-up.

11:21.887 --> 11:24.306
THE MANDALORIAN:
Don't worry about the rhydonium.

11:24.807 --> 11:28.477
As long as you drive steady,
you'll get us to the refinery.

11:44.869 --> 11:45.870
WOMAN 1: Go, go!

11:46.453 --> 11:49.123
MAN: Out of the road. Go!
WOMAN 2: Get to safety!

12:04.930 --> 12:07.391
Yeah. Empire, New Republic.

12:07.474 --> 12:09.185
It's all the same to these people.

12:09.852 --> 12:12.104
Invaders on their land is all we are.

12:17.276 --> 12:18.277
MAYFELD: I'm just sayin',

12:18.360 --> 12:22.031
somewhere someone in this galaxy
is ruling and others are being ruled.

12:22.114 --> 12:23.449
I mean, look at your race.

12:23.532 --> 12:26.660
Do you think all those people
that died in wars fought by Mandalorians

12:26.744 --> 12:27.870
actually had a choice?

12:28.370 --> 12:30.706
So how are they any different
than the Empire?

12:32.917 --> 12:35.085
If you were born on Mandalore,
you believe one thing,

12:35.169 --> 12:37.546
if you're born on Alderaan,
you believe somethin' else.

12:38.130 --> 12:39.131
But guess what?

12:39.715 --> 12:41.425
Neither one of 'em exist anymore.

12:45.554 --> 12:49.391
Hey, I'm just a realist.
I'm a survivor, just like you.

12:49.975 --> 12:51.977
THE MANDALORIAN:
Let's get one thing straight.

12:52.061 --> 12:53.771
You and I are nothing alike.

12:53.854 --> 12:57.983
I don't know. Seems to me like your rules
start to change when you get desperate.

12:58.067 --> 12:59.360
I mean, look at ya.

13:00.027 --> 13:01.987
You said
you couldn't take your helmet off,

13:02.071 --> 13:04.949
and now you got a stormtrooper one on,
so what's the rule?

13:05.783 --> 13:09.370
Is it that you can't take off your
Mando helmet, or you can't show your face?

13:09.453 --> 13:10.996
'Cause there is a difference.

13:14.917 --> 13:17.878
Look, I'm just sayin', we're all the same.

13:19.129 --> 13:22.550
Everybody's got their lines
they don't cross until things get messy.

13:23.092 --> 13:25.636
As far as I'm concerned,
if you can make it through your day

13:25.719 --> 13:28.180
and still sleep at night,
you're doin' better than most.

13:28.264 --> 13:30.307
Control, this is Juggernaut Three.

13:30.391 --> 13:32.059
We're comin' up
on some route interference.

13:32.977 --> 13:35.437
Control, control!
We need a new...

13:35.521 --> 13:36.522
What was that?

13:36.605 --> 13:38.440
WOMAN: Please stand by for reroute.

13:43.487 --> 13:45.322
Juggernaut Four has been destroyed.

13:45.406 --> 13:46.407
"Destroyed"?

13:46.490 --> 13:48.659
THE MANDALORIAN:
The rhydonium is still stable.

13:48.742 --> 13:50.870
WOMAN: Juggernaut Five,
maintain speed and course.

13:50.953 --> 13:52.079
Proceed with caution.

13:52.162 --> 13:55.416
-Re-routing course, stand by.
-"Proceed with caution"? Is she serious?

13:55.875 --> 13:58.169
PILOT 5: Control,
this is Juggernaut Three. Requesting...

14:14.351 --> 14:16.187
What the hell was that?

14:18.772 --> 14:21.692
THE MANDALORIAN: Pirates. Keep driving.
I'll take care of it.

14:27.656 --> 14:29.992
Are you seriously
shooting a blaster near rhydonium?

14:30.075 --> 14:32.411
-

14:32.494 --> 14:34.371
THE MANDALORIAN:
They've thermal detonators.

14:34.455 --> 14:36.332
-MAYFELD: Terrific.
-Just keep it steady.

14:37.166 --> 14:39.126
MAYFELD: Get these guys off us!
Get 'em off us!

14:48.844 --> 14:51.430
-

14:58.020 --> 15:00.523
-They're trying to blow the rhydonium.
-You think?

15:01.524 --> 15:03.734
You should've left me in prison!

15:20.751 --> 15:23.337
-

15:39.061 --> 15:42.273
-

15:57.454 --> 15:59.957
THE MANDALORIAN:
Mayfeld! Pick it up. Drive faster!

16:15.973 --> 16:17.892
I don't think faster's a good idea!

16:20.019 --> 16:22.146
THE MANDALORIAN: What are you doing?

17:35.970 --> 17:38.472
Uh, Mando, I gotta stop.

17:38.556 --> 17:40.140
I can't cross at this speed.

18:18.053 --> 18:21.098
-Whoo!
-

18:30.065 --> 18:32.359
STORMTROOPER LEADER: Go! Go!
Stay on high alert!

18:32.443 --> 18:35.487
-Fire! On your right!
-

19:05.434 --> 19:07.728
Never thought you'd be happy
to see stormtroopers.

19:23.202 --> 19:25.079
STORMTROOPER 1: Here they are.
They made it.

19:25.162 --> 19:27.331
-STORMTROOPER 2: Yes!
-

19:38.592 --> 19:41.178
-STORMTROOPER 3: Glory of the Empire!
-

19:48.561 --> 19:50.062
STORMTROOPER 4: There we go!

19:50.145 --> 19:52.481
Okay. All we gotta do is find a terminal.

19:57.403 --> 19:58.404
MAN: Ya did it!

19:59.947 --> 20:01.866
SHORETROOPER:
Bringing glory to the Empire!

20:01.949 --> 20:03.784
MAYFELD:
It's probably in the officers' mess.

20:09.290 --> 20:11.500
STORMTROOPER 5:
I can't believe they pulled that off.

20:19.967 --> 20:20.968
There it is.

20:21.969 --> 20:23.429
-Okay.
-THE MANDALORIAN: Good luck.

20:36.400 --> 20:38.777
-I can't go in there.
-THE MANDALORIAN: Why not?

20:38.861 --> 20:41.155
-That's Valin Hess.
-Who?

20:41.530 --> 20:43.532
It's Valin Hess.
I used to serve under him.

20:43.616 --> 20:45.326
-Will he recognize you?
-MAYFELD: I don't know.

20:45.409 --> 20:48.662
I was just a field operative,
but I'm not takin' the chance. It's over.

20:48.746 --> 20:51.332
Let's just do this quick
and we can get out of here.

20:51.665 --> 20:54.084
I can't do it, okay?
We have to abort. I'm sorry.

20:54.168 --> 20:55.753
No. I can't.

20:56.587 --> 20:59.632
If we don't get those coordinates,
I'll lose the kid forever.

21:00.382 --> 21:02.801
-Give me the data stick.
-It's not gonna work.

21:08.849 --> 21:12.770
In order to access the network,
the terminal has to scan your face.

21:14.980 --> 21:16.065
Let's go.

21:16.565 --> 21:17.608
Give it to me.

21:53.185 --> 21:56.355
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Error, error. Facial scan incomplete.

21:56.438 --> 21:59.233
Ten seconds to system shutdown.

21:59.316 --> 22:03.904
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

22:03.988 --> 22:08.033
five, four, three, two...

22:09.910 --> 22:11.245
Facial scan complete.

22:30.055 --> 22:31.056
Trooper!

22:40.900 --> 22:42.902
-Hey, trooper.
-

22:44.570 --> 22:47.198
Pay attention
when a superior addresses you.

22:48.490 --> 22:49.742
What's your designation?

22:51.869 --> 22:53.037
Transport crew.

22:54.788 --> 22:55.789
What?

22:56.498 --> 22:58.667
My designation is transport copilot.

22:59.251 --> 23:00.252
VALIN HESS: No, son.

23:02.129 --> 23:04.048
What's your TK number?

23:06.842 --> 23:09.345
-My TK number is...
-Uh-huh.

23:09.428 --> 23:12.348
This is my Commanding Officer
TK-593, sir.

23:13.849 --> 23:17.269
I'm Imperial Combat Assault Transport
Lieutenant TK-111, sir.

23:17.353 --> 23:19.688
I'm afraid you'll have to
speak up to him a little bit

23:19.772 --> 23:21.941
since his vessel lost pressure in Taanab.

23:26.737 --> 23:28.781
What's your name, Officer?

23:32.326 --> 23:34.828
We just call him Brown Eyes.
Isn't that right, Officer?

23:35.704 --> 23:39.124
Let's go fill out those TPS reports,
so we can go recharge the power coils.

23:39.208 --> 23:40.876
VALIN HESS: You're not dismissed.

23:50.302 --> 23:53.472
You the tank troopers
that delivered the shipment of rhydonium?

23:54.265 --> 23:56.058
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

24:08.863 --> 24:13.117
Well, you two managed to be the only
transport today to deliver their shipment.

24:17.621 --> 24:18.873
Come with me, hmm?

24:22.293 --> 24:26.797
Let's get a drink, Brown Eyes.

24:43.355 --> 24:45.191
CARA: We'll have to take out those cannons

24:45.274 --> 24:48.110
if Boba's gonna get close enough
to lift 'em outta there.

24:49.236 --> 24:50.738
FENNEC SHAND: Shouldn't be a problem.

24:50.821 --> 24:53.574
You concentrate on the troopers,
I'll take the cannons.

24:58.621 --> 25:00.456
I wonder what's takin' them so long.

25:01.457 --> 25:03.334
VALIN HESS:
So what shall we toast to, boys?

25:04.376 --> 25:10.424
I can blather on about
"To health" or "To success,"

25:13.928 --> 25:16.555
but I'd like to do
somethin' a little less rote.

25:18.224 --> 25:19.517
Where you from, Brown Eyes?

25:24.021 --> 25:26.398
How 'bout a toast to Operation Cinder?

25:28.484 --> 25:30.945
Now there's a man who knows his history.

25:31.612 --> 25:33.822
No, I don't just know it. I lived it.

25:35.699 --> 25:36.784
I was in Burnin Konn.

25:37.952 --> 25:39.495
-Burnin Konn?
-MAYFELD: Mmm.

25:40.704 --> 25:41.705
That was a hard day.

25:42.831 --> 25:45.459
I had to make many unpleasant decisions.

25:46.418 --> 25:47.545
Yes, you did.

25:50.464 --> 25:53.259
Entire city gone in moments,
along with everybody in it.

25:54.718 --> 25:56.554
We lost our whole division that day.

25:57.721 --> 25:59.431
Man, that was like 5-10,000 people.

26:00.641 --> 26:01.642
Yep.

26:02.351 --> 26:04.311
All heroes of the Empire.

26:04.395 --> 26:05.521
Yeah.

26:05.980 --> 26:07.189
And all dead.

26:08.482 --> 26:11.527
VALIN HESS: Well, it's a small sacrifice
for the greater good, son.

26:13.612 --> 26:15.614
Depends on who you ask, don't you think?

26:16.532 --> 26:18.367
What you gettin' at, trooper?

26:18.576 --> 26:21.412
All those people, the ones who died,

26:22.830 --> 26:24.164
was it good for them?

26:24.999 --> 26:26.876
Hmm? Their families?

26:28.210 --> 26:29.461
The guys I served with?

26:32.256 --> 26:35.676
Civilians, those poor mud scuffers,
died defendin' their homes,

26:37.261 --> 26:38.387
fighting for freedom.

26:39.388 --> 26:40.514
Was it good for 'em?

26:43.392 --> 26:45.728
But we've outlasted them, son.

26:46.395 --> 26:48.480
They're eatin' themselves alive.

26:49.148 --> 26:53.652
The New Republic is in complete disarray,
and we grow stronger.

26:54.862 --> 26:56.989
You see,
with the rhydonium you've delivered,

26:57.072 --> 27:02.328
we can create havoc that's gonna make
Burnin Konn just pale by comparison.

27:03.454 --> 27:05.748
And then they're gonna
turn to us once again.

27:09.960 --> 27:14.757
You see, boys,
everybody thinks they want freedom,

27:16.550 --> 27:19.887
but what they really want is order.

27:23.098 --> 27:24.642
And when they realize that,

27:26.477 --> 27:29.355
they're gonna welcome us back
with open arms.

27:33.859 --> 27:34.860
Ah.

27:38.072 --> 27:39.240
To the Empire.

27:59.093 --> 28:00.219
You did what you had to do.

28:01.762 --> 28:02.888
I never saw your face.

28:09.270 --> 28:12.022
Security to main commons.

28:15.484 --> 28:16.485
MAYFELD: This way!

28:16.569 --> 28:18.571
SHORETROOPER:
We need support at the mess hall.

28:20.614 --> 28:22.700
-THE MANDALORIAN: Ready? Go!

28:22.783 --> 28:25.244
-SHORETROOPER 2: Hold it right there!

28:34.170 --> 28:37.089
-South wall, halfway up.

28:38.007 --> 28:39.008
Got 'em.

28:47.808 --> 28:49.143
We're on. Start your run.

28:50.186 --> 28:51.270
BOBA FETT: On my way.

29:10.247 --> 29:11.624
Three shooters, top deck.

29:12.166 --> 29:13.167
Got 'em.

29:19.089 --> 29:22.384
THE MANDALORIAN: Let's move.
MAYFELD: The hell you think I'm doin'?

29:22.927 --> 29:24.762
-

29:31.060 --> 29:32.269
MAYFELD: Go! Go! Go! Go!

29:55.251 --> 29:56.627
Hand me that cycler rifle.

30:16.188 --> 30:17.189
Nice shot.

30:19.108 --> 30:20.109
Huh.

30:23.070 --> 30:24.572
We all need to sleep at night.

30:36.292 --> 30:37.334
BOBA FETT: We got company.

30:38.460 --> 30:39.503
Hang on.

31:15.706 --> 31:17.958
Well, looks like
it's back to the scrap heap.

31:23.088 --> 31:24.590
THE MANDALORIAN: Thank you for helping.

31:25.216 --> 31:26.217
MAYFELD: Yeah.

31:26.300 --> 31:29.178
Uh, good luck gettin' your kid back.

31:32.139 --> 31:33.140
All right, Officer,

31:34.642 --> 31:35.684
take me back.

31:36.560 --> 31:38.521
That was some nice shootin' back there.

31:38.604 --> 31:39.813
Oh, you saw that?

31:39.897 --> 31:42.233
Yeah, that,
uh, that wasn't part of the plan.

31:43.484 --> 31:45.653
I was just gettin' some stuff
off my chest.

31:48.989 --> 31:52.451
You know, it's too bad Mayfeld
didn't make it out alive back there.

31:52.535 --> 31:54.328
THE MANDALORIAN: Yeah, too bad.

31:55.621 --> 31:56.997
What are you talkin' about?

31:57.998 --> 32:00.584
Looked to me like prisoner number
three-four-six-six-seven

32:00.668 --> 32:03.087
died in the refinery explosion on Morak.

32:05.798 --> 32:08.300
Does that mean I can go? Huh?

32:11.178 --> 32:12.179
'Cause I will.

32:19.562 --> 32:20.563
All right.

32:29.405 --> 32:31.490
You get the coordinates on Moff Gideon?

32:31.574 --> 32:32.575
We did.

32:33.325 --> 32:34.410
What's our next move?

33:01.604 --> 33:02.605
Sir...

33:03.731 --> 33:04.899
You should see this.

33:07.651 --> 33:09.278
THE MANDALORIAN: Moff Gideon.

33:10.321 --> 33:12.990
You have something I want.

33:13.657 --> 33:17.286
You may think you have some idea
what you are in possession of,

33:18.204 --> 33:19.788
but you do not.

33:21.248 --> 33:24.960
Soon, he will be back with me.

33:26.754 --> 33:28.672
He means more to me

33:29.673 --> 33:31.717
than you will ever know.
