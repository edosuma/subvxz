<i>What's it all about?</i>

00:46.381 --> 00:49.759
<i>America, Jesus, freedom.</i>

00:49.926 --> 00:51.177
<i>Say it again.</i>

00:51.344 --> 00:54.722
America, Jesus, freedom.

00:54.889 --> 00:56.099
And what does that mean?

00:56.266 --> 01:00.853
Shit, I don't know.
But the people sure love it when I say it.

01:01.020 --> 01:02.689
How's my hair?

01:02.855 --> 01:05.525
Strong. Real strong.

01:07.402 --> 01:09.737
Let's send him back to Washington.

01:09.904 --> 01:14.158
Democratic congressman today,
vice president tomorrow.

01:14.325 --> 01:17.036
Here he is, running unopposed...

01:17.203 --> 01:20.164
- Hello, everyone!
- ...Cam Brady!

01:21.583 --> 01:26.004
North Carolina is taking care of business.

01:26.963 --> 01:31.884
Just like you, every day,
I'm living the American dream.

01:32.510 --> 01:34.846
I come from humble beginnings.

01:35.013 --> 01:36.848
My father worked with his hands...

01:37.015 --> 01:40.560
...as head stylist for Vidal Sassoon.

01:40.727 --> 01:43.730
- Amen!
- Very much the typical American family.

01:43.896 --> 01:48.693
I'm here today with my beautiful family,
and I'd love for you to welcome them.

01:48.860 --> 01:51.279
My two children, Jessica, Cam Jr.

01:51.446 --> 01:55.116
- I love you, J. Lo. Camouflage.
- Get them, Camo!

01:55.283 --> 01:59.329
And of course, my Rock of Gibraltar...

01:59.495 --> 02:01.289
...Mrs. Rose Brady, my wife.

02:01.456 --> 02:02.498
Love you, baby.

02:02.665 --> 02:04.959
My dream maker. Thanks for coming out.

02:05.126 --> 02:07.462
Cam Brady '012.

02:08.338 --> 02:11.215
Our nation's security
has never been stronger...

02:11.382 --> 02:16.012
...because our troops and our veterans
are this nation's backbone.

02:16.179 --> 02:20.308
Because farmers are this nation's backbone.

02:20.767 --> 02:24.896
Schools is this nation's backbone.

02:25.063 --> 02:30.401
Audio-installation specialists and window
tinters are this nation's backbone.

02:30.568 --> 02:36.741
Because Filipino Tilt-A-Whirl operators
are this nation's backbone.

02:38.826 --> 02:41.621
And I wanna make you a promise today...

02:41.788 --> 02:46.209
...that if you send me back to Washington,
D.C., for a fifth consecutive term...

02:46.376 --> 02:52.048
...I will let them know it's about America,
Jesus and freedom.

02:52.256 --> 02:53.925
We love you, Cam!

02:55.218 --> 02:57.303
I love you too.

02:57.470 --> 02:59.430
You got a lot of energy, don't you?

03:02.225 --> 03:03.518
- Oh, Shana.
- Oh! Oh, Cam!

03:03.685 --> 03:05.144
Your body's so toned.

03:05.311 --> 03:06.562
- Cam!
- So toned.

03:06.729 --> 03:09.982
- Cam, it smells horrible in here.
- It's not that bad once you get used to it.

03:11.359 --> 03:14.570
If it's a-rocking, don't come a-knocking.

03:19.742 --> 03:21.285
This is bad, Cam.

03:21.452 --> 03:24.664
This is real bad. Okay?
I don't like those numbers at all.

03:24.831 --> 03:28.334
- Just one poll. Those things aren't scientific.
- Yes, they are.

03:28.501 --> 03:30.420
All this is is science. This is math.

03:30.586 --> 03:33.214
But if you took it
and put it on its axis this way...

03:33.381 --> 03:36.801
Hey, look, Cam, I'm telling you right now,
it was the phone call.

03:36.968 --> 03:38.219
- Mm-mm.
- Yes.

03:38.386 --> 03:41.889
- No way.
- Yes way. No, look at this, look at this, okay?

03:42.056 --> 03:45.435
Sixty-two percent of the people
that got asked liked you, okay?

03:45.601 --> 03:49.188
Then the phone call happened.
Then they asked the same question.

03:49.355 --> 03:51.607
Now only 46 percent of the people like you.

03:52.108 --> 03:54.026
Run through it one more time.

03:54.193 --> 03:56.362
Look, before the call, this is you.
Like <i>Price Is Right.</i>

03:58.865 --> 04:00.783
And then look at that. Straight down.

04:00.950 --> 04:04.287
I thought I was calling Shana. I misdialed.

04:04.704 --> 04:07.373
And, Lord, we just pray
that you bless this table...

04:07.540 --> 04:09.584
...this food, this family and this nation.

04:11.711 --> 04:15.715
Hey, Jared,
let's let the machine take one for God.

04:17.716 --> 04:20.887
<i>Hey, Shana,
it's Congressman Cam Brady here.</i>

04:21.053 --> 04:25.933
<i>I just stepped away from a family dinner to
tell you I wish I wasn't eating fried steak.</i>

04:26.100 --> 04:28.227
<i>I wish I was eating Shana pussy.</i>

04:28.394 --> 04:32.273
<i>Seriously, baby, you get me so hard
my dick presses against my zipper...</i>

04:32.440 --> 04:34.484
<i>...and it hurts like a motherfucker.</i>

04:34.650 --> 04:35.693
<i>What else?</i>

04:35.860 --> 04:38.446
<i>Oh, hey, I got your parents tickets to
The Producers.</i>

04:38.613 --> 04:41.616
<i>And, oh, yeah,
let's do something crazy weird next time...</i>

04:41.783 --> 04:44.702
<i>like lick each other's buttholes
in</i> a <i>Denny's bathroom.</i>

04:44.869 --> 04:47.121
<i>All right, I gotta go. Cam Brady in '012.</i>

04:47.288 --> 04:49.874
- Okay.
- Now, that was clearly a wrong number.

04:50.041 --> 04:51.876
- Right.
- He is not listening to Jesus...

04:52.043 --> 04:56.005
...because if he was,
oh, Jesus would give him a tongue-lashing.

04:56.172 --> 04:59.300
Not like the one he has requested.

05:00.343 --> 05:02.303
And that family's hopping mad.

05:02.470 --> 05:04.597
- What do you want me to say?
- You tell me.

05:05.097 --> 05:07.725
I fucked up.

05:07.892 --> 05:10.645
Yeah, we're in a bad situation here, okay?

05:10.812 --> 05:14.065
- What do you wanna do?
- Get out front. Walk it back.

05:15.441 --> 05:19.237
We can't have this.
It's a behavior that has to stop.

05:19.403 --> 05:21.364
But, congressman, you made the call.

05:21.531 --> 05:24.033
I have made in my lifetime...

05:24.200 --> 05:27.453
...probably over 100,000 phone calls...

05:27.620 --> 05:30.957
...of which I could say maybe 1 percent
have been inappropriate.

05:31.123 --> 05:33.501
- What is that, a thousand phone calls?
- That is exactly 1000.

05:33.668 --> 05:38.506
A thousand phone calls have been rude,
inappropriate, sexually explicit.

05:38.673 --> 05:40.383
Phone calls I wish I could take back.

05:40.550 --> 05:45.721
But that's only 1000 out of 100,000.
I'll take those odds any day of the week.

05:49.517 --> 05:50.726
(BAND PLAYING SLOW JAZZ MUSIO

05:50.893 --> 05:53.771
Gentlemen, I can't bring this bill
to the floor. I'll get killed.

05:53.938 --> 05:57.191
There is no way Congress
will let Motch Worldwide Global...

05:57.358 --> 06:01.487
...put "made in America"
on goods made in China.

06:01.654 --> 06:05.408
Why not?
The name of the town in China is America.

06:05.575 --> 06:07.243
Oh, now, technically it's Mera-Kai.

06:07.410 --> 06:09.954
My brother and I are job creators.

06:10.121 --> 06:13.207
And because of that,
we're also candidate creators.

06:13.374 --> 06:14.750
My hands are tied.

06:14.917 --> 06:17.253
- That's a real pity, isn't it, Wade?
- Yeah.

06:17.420 --> 06:21.007
By the time we're finished, half your
district will think you're a Marxist...

06:21.173 --> 06:25.219
...and the other half will think you've got
every D.C. Craigslist hooker on speed dial.

06:25.386 --> 06:27.179
Got it?

06:27.346 --> 06:31.392
<i>When the family plugged in their phone
into the answering machine...</i>

06:31.559 --> 06:34.186
<i>...they became consenting adults.</i>

06:34.353 --> 06:35.563
Cam Brady's done.

06:35.730 --> 06:37.982
He doesn't have this district
locked up any more.

06:38.149 --> 06:40.067
Let's get Brady out of there.

06:40.234 --> 06:42.612
Finance someone
who'll be a friend of the Motches...

06:42.778 --> 06:44.739
...and help us change these regulations.

06:44.906 --> 06:47.533
Who do we have down there
that we could run?

06:47.700 --> 06:50.536
Big Jim Santon's in prison
for embezzling state lottery funds.

06:50.703 --> 06:54.749
- Sad.
- Well, Raymond Huggins' boy Marty?

06:55.708 --> 06:57.543
Isn't he the weird one?

06:57.710 --> 07:00.212
Has weird ever stopped us before?

07:00.379 --> 07:05.217
<i>How, in the year 2012,
do they still have an answering machine?</i>

07:05.384 --> 07:07.720
<i>Why are they denied modern technology?</i>

07:07.887 --> 07:09.972
Make the call.

07:15.937 --> 07:17.688
Come on, guys.

07:19.815 --> 07:23.235
- Hey there, Marty.
- Hey, Tammy.

07:24.862 --> 07:29.575
- Good morning, Dr. Scruggs.
- I have no idea who you are.

07:30.034 --> 07:32.995
Hey, Diane.
How's business at Candles 'N' Such?

07:33.162 --> 07:36.707
Such is selling.
I can't move the candles, though.

07:36.874 --> 07:39.835
Yes, you can, Diane.
"Can't" is the real C-word.

07:42.713 --> 07:46.342
Cock-a-doodle-doo, Travis. You look tired.
Did you get some sleep?

07:46.509 --> 07:48.761
Yeah, I'm just real high.

07:48.928 --> 07:50.680
You're hysterical, Travis.

07:51.263 --> 07:55.351
- How's the turnout for the 11:30 tour?
- Just one person signed in.

07:55.518 --> 07:59.730
What? Are you serious? What happened
to the eighth-grade field trip?

07:59.897 --> 08:02.274
I guess the kids
would just rather go to class.

08:02.441 --> 08:05.695
- Well, I just need one person.
- Yeah, well, guess who it is.

08:05.861 --> 08:09.115
Mrs. Cutler again.
She got a crush on you, Marty.

08:09.281 --> 08:11.534
She's gonna have to get in line. Heh.

08:12.535 --> 08:16.580
Hammond, or the jewel of the Carolinas,
as I like to call it...

08:16.747 --> 08:21.002
...is rich in history
and flush with natural beauty.

08:21.168 --> 08:22.795
We've also had celebrities pass through.

08:22.962 --> 08:25.089
Eight years ago,
actress Rosie Perez passed through...

08:26.465 --> 08:29.510
...when she got turned around on the
interstate and came to ask us for direc...

08:29.677 --> 08:32.679
- Travis, stop, stop. Stop the tour. Stop the tour.
- Now? All right.

08:34.932 --> 08:36.600
Hello, Father?

08:37.143 --> 08:38.227
Yes.

08:38.394 --> 08:40.730
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

08:59.874 --> 09:02.710
Oh, I's a-coming, I's a-coming.

09:02.877 --> 09:04.045
Patience for the tired.

09:04.211 --> 09:07.757
Now, you just enjoy that view
from the porch, now.

09:07.923 --> 09:10.176
Oh. Almost there.

09:11.844 --> 09:14.722
Oh, well, my Lord, if it ain't Mr. Marty.

09:16.307 --> 09:18.976
- Hi, Mrs. Yao.
- Oh, come on in, child.

09:19.143 --> 09:23.064
Oh, Mr. Senior's down at the docks
trying to scare up some catfish.

09:23.230 --> 09:25.608
He's still making you talk like that?

09:25.775 --> 09:28.944
Yup. He pays me an extra 50 bucks a week.

09:29.111 --> 09:31.155
Says it reminds him of the good old days.

09:31.322 --> 09:33.365
- He can be an old coot.
- Yeah.

09:33.532 --> 09:35.951
Well, hey, your daddy down by the lake...

09:36.118 --> 09:37.620
...fishing for some catfish to fry up.

09:37.787 --> 09:40.706
Mm, Lordy, that sounds good.

09:40.873 --> 09:42.416
Catfish.

09:46.045 --> 09:49.298
- Marty, you stack of cock rings.
- Stop! Ha, ha!

09:49.465 --> 09:52.802
- Mouthful of pubes.
- Don't tickle. Stop tickling me! Stop tickling me!

09:52.968 --> 09:55.096
- Full revenge, man.
- Stop! Stop tickling me!

09:55.888 --> 09:58.599
I'm sorry, brother. Ha, ha. Oh, man.

09:58.766 --> 10:00.518
You should see the look
on your stupid face.

10:00.684 --> 10:04.146
Ah. It's good to see you, brother.
Daddy got a little surprise for you.

10:04.313 --> 10:07.108
- Do you know what it is?
- Yeah. But I ain't gonna tell you, dick sweat.

10:07.274 --> 10:09.068
- Bam! Ha, ha.
- Ow!

10:09.235 --> 10:12.321
- It's still funny.
- Come on. Let's not keep Daddy waiting.

10:13.531 --> 10:16.242
Okay. Hey, Daddy.

10:24.875 --> 10:26.836
Now, listen up.

10:27.002 --> 10:30.214
Glenn and Wade Motch called this morning.
You know the Motch brothers?

10:30.381 --> 10:34.802
And they feel there's an opening
to challenge Cam Brady for congressman.

10:34.969 --> 10:38.430
And, well...

10:38.597 --> 10:40.599
...believe it or not...

10:41.142 --> 10:43.769
...they want you to run for office.

10:44.895 --> 10:48.482
Dad, that is like the greatest...

10:50.192 --> 10:53.696
This is like the greatest news I've ever heard.
I can't believe this.

10:53.863 --> 10:57.158
All these years I've been begging you
to let me get into politics...

10:57.324 --> 10:58.742
...and right now here it is.

10:58.909 --> 11:02.955
I didn't even know they knew who I was.
Motch brothers.

11:03.122 --> 11:04.999
Well, I'll tell you this.

11:06.750 --> 11:09.670
I'll make you proud. I will.

11:11.297 --> 11:13.299
I'll make you... I'll make you real proud.

11:13.841 --> 11:17.344
I'd say there's mathematically zero chance
of that happening.

11:17.511 --> 11:19.597
Your brother Tripp is a bull's-eye.

11:19.763 --> 11:23.309
But you look like Richard Simmons
just crapped out a goddamn hobbit.

11:23.475 --> 11:28.439
Dad, if you're still holding a grudge
because I wore Crocs to Mom's funeral...

11:28.606 --> 11:32.234
...like I've told you a thousand times,
I'm sorry.

11:32.401 --> 11:35.070
Mom would've wanted it that way.
She was casual.

11:35.696 --> 11:37.198
I don't even know what to think.

11:37.364 --> 11:39.283
I got so many thoughts
running through my mind...

11:39.450 --> 11:43.746
...about what I can do for the district and
for the town, for the people of Hammond.

11:43.913 --> 11:47.166
Give them a voice.
Put them in the right direction.

11:47.333 --> 11:49.293
I mean, it's a mess out there.

11:49.460 --> 11:53.297
Son, it's no secret
we've never enjoyed each other's company.

11:53.464 --> 11:56.008
You can be so bleak sometimes, Dad.

11:56.175 --> 11:57.218
Hmm.

11:57.718 --> 12:02.056
Did you ever get that calendar I sent
of those animals dressed in human clothing?

12:02.223 --> 12:05.017
I was looking at mine yesterday
because I bought one for myself...

12:05.184 --> 12:07.770
...and it had a giraffe in high heels.

12:07.937 --> 12:10.564
And I thought to myself,
"Who thinks of this stuff?"

12:10.731 --> 12:12.358
I laughed so hard.

12:12.524 --> 12:15.945
I thought it was super cute.
A giraffe is tall enough as is.

12:16.111 --> 12:18.781
Then somebody thought,
"Let's put a giraffe in high heels.

12:18.948 --> 12:21.283
Maybe add a belt.
There was a little bow on him."

12:21.450 --> 12:24.411
Boy, you really are a sad little fucker,
aren't you?

13:02.616 --> 13:06.829
This is the 14th district of
North Carolina and the city of Hammond.

13:06.996 --> 13:10.833
We are acquiring massive parcels of real
estate under a shell corporation...

13:11.000 --> 13:13.127
...so we can reopen three large factories.

13:13.294 --> 13:14.837
Ostensibly, we own this district.

13:15.004 --> 13:18.424
We think we can operate at the same
regulatory and wage levels as China...

13:18.590 --> 13:20.592
...and eliminate shipping costs.

13:20.759 --> 13:23.012
And your government will cooperate?

13:23.178 --> 13:26.015
We also own
the most important resource of all:

13:26.181 --> 13:27.683
a willing candidate.

13:27.850 --> 13:31.645
Candidate. Your elections
are unpredictable.

13:31.812 --> 13:35.274
Mr. Zheng, there's something
you need to know about American politics.

13:35.441 --> 13:38.819
When you've got the money,
nothing is unpredictable.

13:41.572 --> 13:44.533
<i>Sometimes democracy moves
with the stroke of a pen...</i>

13:44.700 --> 13:48.245
...and tonight Cam Brady
will win his fifth term in Congress...

13:48.412 --> 13:50.831
...simply by registering for the ballot.

13:50.998 --> 13:53.292
That's the perks of running unopposed.

13:53.459 --> 13:57.087
- Check it out. It's a picture of my dick.
- Oh, come on.

13:57.254 --> 14:00.466
I shaved my pubic hair to look
like a 19th-century handlebar mustache.

14:00.632 --> 14:03.385
- Man, put that away, will you?
- I'm gonna tweet it to Shana.

14:03.552 --> 14:05.679
- Cam, don't do that, please.
- Too late.

14:05.846 --> 14:07.848
I CC'd you. Heh.

14:08.015 --> 14:09.808
- I don't wanna see it.
- You're welcome.

14:09.975 --> 14:15.105
Next up, we have ballot confirmation
of Camden Brady, congressman.

14:15.272 --> 14:16.315
Thank you, Carl.

14:16.482 --> 14:18.942
- Let's get this bad boy signed.
- Let's do it.

14:26.533 --> 14:31.205
I couldn't tell what was going on.
I thought the thing was locked.

14:33.874 --> 14:35.292
What the hell is this?

14:38.087 --> 14:39.588
Hey, Becky.
- HL

14:43.675 --> 14:48.722
Hello.
My name is Marty Sylvester Huggins...

14:49.390 --> 14:54.812
...and I'm here today to formally announce
my candidacy on the Republican ticket...

14:54.978 --> 14:57.940
...for the 14th district for congressman.

14:58.357 --> 15:03.987
I have, uh, my check and my application and
my birth certificate all right here if you...

15:04.154 --> 15:06.281
Wait, what...? Hold on. Hold on.
What's going on here?

15:07.699 --> 15:10.786
Hold on a second, Cam.
Let me take a look at this.

15:12.037 --> 15:13.664
All his paperwork is here.

15:15.290 --> 15:17.501
Marty Huggins is officially
on the ballot...

15:17.668 --> 15:19.837
- ...running for congressional representative...
- What?

15:20.003 --> 15:21.964
...of the 14th district of North Carolina.

15:22.131 --> 15:23.966
- Are you kidding me?
- Hey, come on, Carl.

15:24.133 --> 15:26.593
- Is this some kind of joke?
- Come on, Carl.

15:26.760 --> 15:28.554
They're gonna wanna get to know you...

15:28.720 --> 15:30.889
...now that you're challenging
our congressman.

15:31.056 --> 15:32.891
How do you expect to do that?

15:36.353 --> 15:39.565
- Uh, say that again.
- That's Marty Huggins.

15:39.731 --> 15:42.901
You know, back in fourth grade,
they used to call him Tickle Shits...

15:43.068 --> 15:45.737
...because all you had to do was tickle him
and he'd shit his pants.

15:45.904 --> 15:48.157
- Oh, I remember that name.
- Mm-hm.

15:48.323 --> 15:50.617
I'm Marty Huggins,
and I approve this message.

15:50.784 --> 15:52.536
- I've always wanted to say that.
- Heh.

15:56.290 --> 15:58.167
What the hell?

15:58.333 --> 15:59.626
I can't seem to...

15:59.793 --> 16:01.628
- Push the door.
- Yeah, you gonna push.

16:01.795 --> 16:04.423
Push it? Push it real good?

16:04.882 --> 16:07.968
- Not good with doors. Heh.
- No.

16:08.135 --> 16:10.387
- It's called a door.
- Ha, ha.

16:10.596 --> 16:12.264
<i>Breaking news out of North Carolina.</i>

16:12.431 --> 16:13.974
<i>Democratic incumbent Cam Brady...</i>

16:14.141 --> 16:17.144
<i>getting a run for his money
by newcomer Marty Huggins.</i>

16:17.311 --> 16:20.397
<i>Early rumors have billionaire
industrialists the Motch brothers...</i>

16:20.564 --> 16:22.649
<i>...financing a PAC supporting Huggins.</i>

16:22.816 --> 16:27.404
<i>And with a thin majority in the House,
this race could be hugely important.</i>

16:28.238 --> 16:31.366
You know, baby, I've been thinking.
I don't like this.

16:31.533 --> 16:35.329
Why does a Marty Huggins
come out of nowhere and decide to run?

16:35.496 --> 16:38.832
Baby, I'm a thoroughbred.
I'm gonna smoke that clown.

16:38.999 --> 16:43.212
Kids, put your headphones in.
About to use TV mature words.

16:43.378 --> 16:45.797
You know I love it
when you get all bitchy and wild.

16:48.050 --> 16:50.344
You listen to me,
you dick dragging around a body.

16:50.511 --> 16:53.430
Marty Huggins' daddy is Raymond Huggins.

16:53.597 --> 16:55.724
He was Jesse Helms' campaign manager
for six terms.

16:55.891 --> 16:58.477
- Mm-hm.
- He's got fucking juice. What have you got?

16:58.644 --> 17:01.980
A mistress with a GED and a 9-year-old son.

17:02.564 --> 17:03.857
She's got a kid?

17:07.986 --> 17:10.364
<i>Ass and titties, ass and titties
And big booty bitches</i>

17:13.075 --> 17:15.243
<i>Ass and titties, ass and titties
Ass and titties</i>

17:15.452 --> 17:18.079
Last election,
<i>Newsweek</i> mentioned you as a possible VP.

17:18.247 --> 17:20.707
- I want that VP nod, Cam.
- Okay.

17:20.874 --> 17:25.170
I wanna be second lady.
And what are you doing to make that happen?

17:25.337 --> 17:30.008
You're grinding your hairy crescent roll against
any piece of ass that flashes you a smile.

17:30.175 --> 17:32.511
None of that was my fault. I was powerless.

17:32.678 --> 17:38.225
I was plied with copious amounts
of Red Bull, Jell-O shots...

17:38.392 --> 17:39.601
...and GoldschlÃ¤ger.

17:39.768 --> 17:42.479
Remember Dr. Jenkins,
he thought I had Crohn's disease.

17:42.646 --> 17:45.607
There were flakes of 24-karat gold
in my stool for about a month.

17:47.234 --> 17:50.362
I crapped gold.

17:51.780 --> 17:53.574
Was the nicest thing.

17:53.740 --> 17:56.076
- Just got a call from, uh, Cam Brady...
- Oh.

17:56.243 --> 17:59.913
...saying that, uh, he invited me
to something called a civility brunch.

18:00.080 --> 18:01.123
MITZI
Oh.

18:01.290 --> 18:04.126
Which I think is just a chance for us
to share a meal together...

18:04.293 --> 18:06.461
...and talk about the campaign
and its issues...

18:06.628 --> 18:09.381
...and make sure
that everything's gonna be civil, you know?

18:09.548 --> 18:13.510
That's a lovely idea, Marty.
We're all so proud of you.

18:13.927 --> 18:17.848
I knew one day
your dad would realize your true potential.

18:18.015 --> 18:22.102
Um, boys, put down your utensils. I wanna
talk to you about something real quick.

18:23.562 --> 18:25.564
I wanted to take this time...

18:25.731 --> 18:29.693
...to say that we're gonna be under
a lot of media scrutiny.

18:30.152 --> 18:33.822
So if there's anything
that you wanna talk about...

18:33.989 --> 18:36.158
...any kind of secrets...

18:36.325 --> 18:38.994
...or stories or fibs...

18:40.078 --> 18:42.873
...now's the time to put
it on the table, okay?

18:43.040 --> 18:45.959
And if you tell me,
if you tell me and your mom...

18:46.126 --> 18:47.336
...we're not gonna be mad.

18:50.088 --> 18:53.091
I said the Lord's name in vain at school.

18:54.426 --> 18:56.178
Mm-hm.

19:01.516 --> 19:04.645
Well, I said I wasn't gonna get angry,
and I'm not angry.

19:04.811 --> 19:05.979
Okay. Good.

19:06.146 --> 19:11.109
I went to the petting zoo
and I let the goat lick my penis.

19:13.862 --> 19:15.238
What? What...?

19:17.574 --> 19:19.242
- Now, that I have a...
- Now, honey.

19:19.951 --> 19:22.079
Now, you promised
you wouldn't get mad, okay?

19:22.245 --> 19:24.414
They're just... They're being honest.

19:25.332 --> 19:28.168
Okay. Maybe that's... Hopefully, that's it.

19:28.335 --> 19:31.797
I had a beer with the old biker man
at the end of the street...

19:31.963 --> 19:34.466
...and he let me touch
his old lady's titty.

19:34.633 --> 19:38.095
- Oh, God.
- Ugh. "Breast."

19:38.261 --> 19:42.683
I go to the mall and hide in a stairwell
and take photos up women's skirts.

19:42.849 --> 19:46.520
I have a whole book of cooter shots
under my bed.

19:49.523 --> 19:52.025
One time I put a firefly in my butthole.

19:52.192 --> 19:55.821
- Why?
- To make my farts glow.

19:55.987 --> 19:57.614
Oh, God.

19:57.781 --> 20:04.079
I shaved the dog and glued the hair
to my nut sac so I'd look like a grown man.

20:04.746 --> 20:06.206
Oh, God.

20:07.207 --> 20:09.918
I touch myself to Drew Carey
on <i>The Price Is Right.</i>

20:10.085 --> 20:11.086
God.

20:11.420 --> 20:13.130
Okay, that's enough. Stop, please.

20:15.132 --> 20:17.634
I wanna thank you all
for coming here today.

20:17.801 --> 20:22.556
Events like this give us an opportunity
to show Washington, D.C...

20:22.723 --> 20:26.685
...that we're not gonna stand for the
mudslinging that's tearing this country apart.

20:26.852 --> 20:28.019
Support our troops.

20:28.186 --> 20:29.896
- Yes.
- Yeah.

20:31.398 --> 20:34.234
And with that, I would like to, uh,
take this time...

20:34.401 --> 20:38.739
...to introduce my opponent and, uh,
my friend, Marty Huggins.

20:38.905 --> 20:40.323
Marty?

20:44.035 --> 20:45.078
Thank you so much.

20:45.245 --> 20:49.166
Thank you, uh, Cam. Thank you, uh...
Thank you everybody.

20:50.333 --> 20:54.421
Well, I'm a little nervous. Heh.
I'll be honest with you. Um...

20:55.255 --> 20:57.758
My dad always told me two things
about giving speeches.

20:57.924 --> 21:01.178
One, never say anything bad
about the Jews...

21:01.344 --> 21:04.514
...and two, tell an interesting story.

21:04.681 --> 21:05.766
I have two pugs.

21:05.932 --> 21:09.102
One's named Poundcake
and one's named Muffins.

21:09.269 --> 21:10.687
Good Lord.

21:10.854 --> 21:14.399
Anyway, Poundcake loves
to get underneath the sofa.

21:14.566 --> 21:15.984
And I know exactly why.

21:16.151 --> 21:18.904
Because my wife leaves Milky Ways
underneath the sofa...

21:19.070 --> 21:20.530
...with Hamburger Helper on it.

21:20.697 --> 21:24.618
And Muffins is always yapping at him,
like, "Don't go underneath the sofa."

21:24.785 --> 21:25.952
And Poundcake barks back:

21:26.119 --> 21:28.580
"I am under the sofa,
and I'm having a good time."

21:28.997 --> 21:30.624
And they look at me like, "What?"

21:30.791 --> 21:33.376
The other one's looking at the other one,
going, "What?"

21:33.543 --> 21:35.712
Then I walk in like,
"What are y'all two doing?"

21:35.879 --> 21:37.631
But every day, it's the same thing.

21:37.798 --> 21:41.426
Just barking about one of them
being underneath the sofa.

21:43.261 --> 21:46.056
- That's... And that's my story.
- All right.

21:48.683 --> 21:50.644
Thank you very much.

21:51.853 --> 21:52.896
Thank you, Marty.

21:53.563 --> 21:54.940
Have a seat.

21:55.106 --> 21:58.151
I am sorry. Where are my manners?
I forgot Marty's bio.

21:58.318 --> 21:59.569
Didn't know I had a bio.

21:59.736 --> 22:01.738
Mitch, if you'd go
ahead and kill the lights.

22:01.905 --> 22:04.032
If we could draw those curtains, thank you.

22:04.533 --> 22:05.867
Little presentation.

22:06.326 --> 22:10.205
Today we are here
to meet Martin Sylvester Huggins...

22:10.372 --> 22:12.541
...who was born right here in 1972.

22:12.707 --> 22:16.753
As a boy, Marty attended camp
for weight loss and emotional stability.

22:18.129 --> 22:23.218
In high school, he was part of an
all-male a cappella group, Dude Ranch.

22:23.385 --> 22:25.303
At 25, he met the love of his life.

22:25.470 --> 22:28.932
She proposed to him six times
before he said yes.

22:29.099 --> 22:30.642
Together, they have two boys...

22:30.809 --> 22:34.354
...and two pugs,
which, keep in mind, are Chinese.

22:34.521 --> 22:36.064
They're Chinese dogs.

22:38.149 --> 22:40.902
And currently Marty Huggins
works out at Curves...

22:41.444 --> 22:44.406
...which is a workout facility
for plus-size women.

22:47.200 --> 22:50.704
Anyway, don't you find that interesting
to learn about Marty Huggins?

22:50.871 --> 22:52.789
That's my opponent, Marty Huggins.

22:54.374 --> 22:57.419
Eat up, everyone. Enjoy.

23:00.714 --> 23:03.216
Welcome to the fucking show.

23:13.768 --> 23:16.897
Okay, Marty, you're not gonna cry.

23:18.273 --> 23:21.192
Hey. Get some American dogs, you Commie!

23:22.986 --> 23:24.404
- They're not Communist dogs.
- Drive.

23:26.072 --> 23:28.909
Move the car. Stab and steer. Let's go.

23:29.117 --> 23:31.286
- Who are you?
- Tim Wattley.

23:31.453 --> 23:34.456
Motch brothers sent me.
I'm your campaign manager.

23:34.623 --> 23:37.250
I'm here to make you not suck.

23:38.960 --> 23:41.421
Now put this shit bucket in gear.

23:51.348 --> 23:55.852
- What's this all about, Mr. Wattley?
- Your life as you know it is over.

23:56.019 --> 23:58.939
Your campaign headquarters
are being furnished and staffed...

23:59.105 --> 24:02.943
...and the Motch brothers have put $1 million
into your political action committee.

24:03.109 --> 24:05.779
But these are my things.
I mean, this is my doily collection.

24:06.738 --> 24:10.075
- And that's my sign.
- From now on, you don't own pugs.

24:10.241 --> 24:13.161
You own a chocolate Lab and a
golden retriever, two highest-polling dogs.

24:13.328 --> 24:15.914
One of them will be named Sergeant,
the other Scout.

24:16.081 --> 24:18.833
They will wear bandanas.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.043
Sit.

24:21.378 --> 24:22.420
What about my pugs?

24:22.587 --> 24:25.256
- Have them put down humanely.
- Coming through.

24:25.423 --> 24:26.967
No. That cannot stay there.

24:27.133 --> 24:30.804
You wanna put a live deer in the backyard,
fine, but I don't want dead things...

24:30.971 --> 24:33.306
No. You cannot have guns in here.
Are you crazy?

24:33.473 --> 24:37.018
Dylan is prone to intense
bouts of violence.

24:37.185 --> 24:40.939
Marty. Marty, they just let themselves in.
I tried to stop them.

24:41.106 --> 24:43.650
They want me to cut my hair
like Katie Couric.

24:43.817 --> 24:45.527
I want a Bible on this end table...

24:45.694 --> 24:49.322
...and an oil painting of an eagle
over this fireplace, stat.

24:50.031 --> 24:53.785
- I want Lee Greenwood playing 24/7.
- Mitzi, they're just trying to help us win.

24:53.952 --> 24:56.788
- Tim, where you going?
- No, no, no.

24:56.955 --> 24:58.540
You do not take down my family.

24:58.707 --> 25:01.835
Mr. Wattley, what are you doing?
That's my wardrobe.

25:02.002 --> 25:03.378
Not any more, it's not.

25:03.545 --> 25:06.965
From now on,
you wear Men's Wearhouse for formal...

25:07.132 --> 25:09.342
...and the Greg Norman sport collection
for cazh.

25:09.509 --> 25:12.512
And for God's sakes,
put those beds together.

25:12.679 --> 25:14.597
No. No.

25:19.853 --> 25:22.272
These kids need some real help.

25:22.439 --> 25:24.816
Either one of you throw a football?

25:25.567 --> 25:27.986
Goddamn it,
what have you been doing with these boys?

25:28.153 --> 25:30.238
- They're homeschooled.
- They're good eaters.

25:30.447 --> 25:31.531
We have 49 days...

25:31.698 --> 25:35.618
...before this district of 700,000 people
decides if they like you or not.

25:35.785 --> 25:38.705
Right now, your likability
is at 26 percent.

25:38.872 --> 25:42.792
The focus group words
that come up about you are "odd"...

25:42.959 --> 25:45.545
..."clammy," "probably Serbian."

25:45.712 --> 25:48.506
- That's an old one.
- "He looks like the Travelocity gnome."

25:48.673 --> 25:49.716
What?

25:49.883 --> 25:54.137
If you really wanna help this district, the
first thing you have to do, Marty, is win.

25:54.304 --> 25:58.892
I do wanna help the district. I love my home.
It's just all happening so fast.

25:59.059 --> 26:03.688
Listen, I think Cam Brady can be beaten.
But I don't believe you believe that.

26:03.855 --> 26:05.065
You know what?

26:05.231 --> 26:09.152
I'm just gonna call your dad and tell
him you don't have the rocks for this.

26:09.319 --> 26:10.779
Hey.

26:11.321 --> 26:13.031
You put your phone away, Mr. Wattley.

26:13.198 --> 26:17.327
This might be hard for you to believe,
but this dog has a ton of fight in him.

26:17.494 --> 26:18.536
A ton of fight.

26:18.703 --> 26:23.291
And when I get a scent, I hunt, brother.
I hunt all day long.

26:23.458 --> 26:25.919
So don't you ever insinuate anything
like that again.

26:32.300 --> 26:33.843
Call me Tim.

26:34.010 --> 26:36.554
Complete makeover, head to toe.

26:36.721 --> 26:40.391
No, no, no, not the pink one.
Let me have a black one.

26:40.558 --> 26:43.269
It looks like that Precious girl's panties.

26:43.436 --> 26:46.523
Younger, stronger, smarter.

26:48.525 --> 26:49.818
Hit him again.

26:49.984 --> 26:53.238
Oh! Don't do that, it tickles, okay?

26:56.407 --> 26:59.160
<i>Why don't you clean this crap up off the beach?
Keep the change.</i>

26:59.327 --> 27:02.497
Why don't you clean this crap up off the beach?
Keep the change.

27:02.664 --> 27:05.291
Like Burt. Goddamn it.

27:05.458 --> 27:07.293
Why don't you clean this crap up
off the beach?

27:07.460 --> 27:09.921
- Again.
- Why don't you clean this crap up off the beach?

27:10.463 --> 27:12.715
- Get rid of this.
- That's where I keep my things.

27:12.882 --> 27:15.301
No, up. I need you up, like this.
See the difference?

27:15.468 --> 27:17.637
- Yeah.
- Here. Watch me. Up. Up.

27:17.804 --> 27:20.932
Swag. There you go. Like a man.

27:32.819 --> 27:34.070
Right, Mitch.

27:34.237 --> 27:37.365
No, I'm out campaigning right now. Mm-hm.

27:37.532 --> 27:40.702
I'm not taking this thing too lightly.
Heh, give me a break.

27:40.869 --> 27:42.370
You know me better than that.

27:42.537 --> 27:47.500
No, I'm meet... I'm literally meeting people.
Hold on, I gotta shake this guy's hand.

27:50.795 --> 27:52.922
Nice to meet you too, sir.

27:53.089 --> 27:54.340
Okay, I'm back.

27:56.926 --> 27:59.721
Sassy salesman sold me Sicilian sausages.

27:59.888 --> 28:02.599
Keep it simple
and direct questions to the talking points.

28:02.807 --> 28:06.144
- My boy Spanx are too tight.
- They're supposed to be. Now suck in.

28:06.311 --> 28:09.272
When you meet Cam at center stage,
shake hands but don't let go.

28:09.439 --> 28:13.359
Pull him close, maintain a smile,
and then lay some trash talk on him.

28:13.526 --> 28:14.694
- Yeah.
- Set the tone.

28:14.861 --> 28:15.987
Right.

28:16.154 --> 28:19.991
- You jacked?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm jacked, yeah.

28:21.743 --> 28:24.996
- Now you're jacked.
- Now I'm jacked. Okay.

28:33.546 --> 28:38.968
Must be hard running for Miss America
and teaching high school at the same time.

28:39.135 --> 28:41.262
Right. Uh, congressman, I'm married.

28:41.429 --> 28:42.722
- I'm married too.
- Good.

28:42.889 --> 28:45.725
- Looks like we got a common denominator.
- Oh.

28:45.892 --> 28:47.810
- It's a math joke.
- Mm-hm.

28:47.977 --> 28:49.437
- Excuse me, darling.
- It's good.

28:49.604 --> 28:51.314
- Mind if I talk to my man here?
- Sure.

28:51.481 --> 28:54.025
- I appreciate it. Thank you.
- She's very nice.

28:54.192 --> 28:56.527
- I just found out some interesting news.
- Mm-hm.

28:56.694 --> 29:00.740
The Motch brothers put a million bucks in
Marty Huggins' political action committee.

29:00.907 --> 29:03.076
Marty Huggins
has a political action committee?

29:03.243 --> 29:05.328
Evidently. Yeah, it's called HugPAC.

29:05.495 --> 29:06.829
And I saw him on the way in.

29:06.996 --> 29:09.958
They got him in a hundred-dollar suit
and gave him a $5 haircut.

29:10.124 --> 29:12.126
Looks like they just pissed away
a million dollars.

29:12.293 --> 29:13.336
Mm-hm.

29:13.503 --> 29:15.880
- How's my hair?
- Strong.

29:16.047 --> 29:17.799
Too strong.

29:18.007 --> 29:21.177
Good evening, everyone.
Please welcome candidate Marty Huggins...

29:21.344 --> 29:23.263
...and Congressman Cam Brady.

29:27.141 --> 29:29.227
Yeah, baby. Looking good, baby.

29:31.813 --> 29:33.356
- Good to see you.
- How you doing?

29:34.190 --> 29:37.568
Hate to break it to you, friend,
but your balloon's getting ready to pop.

29:37.735 --> 29:40.196
And that balloon's full
of your own butt toots.

29:40.363 --> 29:42.240
Are you trying to trash-talk me?

29:42.782 --> 29:46.077
Might wanna decide whether you're
gonna buy toilet paper or aftershave.

29:46.244 --> 29:48.705
- Because your face is like a butt.
- Oh, my God.

29:48.871 --> 29:51.958
You don't know how to trash-talk, do you?
I do know how to.

29:52.125 --> 29:54.836
- Let me give you some trash talk, okay?
- Mm-hm.

29:55.003 --> 29:58.423
You know what the difference between
your mama and a washing machine is?

29:58.589 --> 30:00.341
When I dump a load in a machine...

30:00.508 --> 30:02.969
...machine doesn't follow me around
for three weeks.

30:03.511 --> 30:04.554
Now you go.

30:07.557 --> 30:10.393
You should take a bath in a toilet.
I just wanna do the debate.

30:10.560 --> 30:11.769
No. Now I go.

30:11.936 --> 30:14.188
You're such a little turd...

30:14.355 --> 30:17.525
...that when you sit in sand,
cats try to bury you.

30:17.692 --> 30:19.319
You have a very vulgar mouth.

30:19.485 --> 30:23.197
- Please let go of my hand.
- I want you to reach down and touch my nuts.

30:23.364 --> 30:25.408
- Stop.
- That's what nuts feel like. Touch it.

30:25.575 --> 30:27.869
- I don't want to.
- Let me see if you got any.

30:28.036 --> 30:30.204
Sirs. Sirs, we'd love to get started.

30:31.622 --> 30:33.041
- I'd love to start.
- Me too.

30:42.633 --> 30:44.302
- Tim.
- Get him something to stand on.

30:46.637 --> 30:47.680
Thank you.

30:47.847 --> 30:50.308
Our first question
will go to the incumbent.

30:50.475 --> 30:53.186
How would you bring jobs back
to the 14th district?

30:53.353 --> 30:56.356
That's a great question, Carl.
Thank you for asking it.

30:56.522 --> 31:00.193
It's the first thing I think of
when I wake up in the morning...

31:00.360 --> 31:03.363
...and it's the last thing I think of
when I go to bed.

31:03.529 --> 31:08.117
Jobs in North Carolina mean what?
A strong North Carolina.

31:08.284 --> 31:12.246
And a strong North Carolina
means a strong America.

31:12.413 --> 31:14.832
And that, my friends,
is how we're gonna do it.

31:14.999 --> 31:18.169
- All right.
- It's how we do, baby.

31:18.336 --> 31:20.213
- Yeah.
- It's how we do.

31:20.755 --> 31:22.048
You've got my vote, Cam.

31:24.175 --> 31:26.928
Mr. Huggins,
you have one minute for a rebuttal.

31:27.095 --> 31:28.596
Just like we rehearsed.

31:28.763 --> 31:32.266
Cam Brady just gave you
the old D.C. Dip and Twirl.

31:32.433 --> 31:34.185
Just danced around the question.

31:34.811 --> 31:38.940
Well, I'm here to tell you, North Carolina,
that when it comes to jobs for my district...

31:39.107 --> 31:41.192
...Martin Huggins doesn't dance.

31:41.359 --> 31:45.279
He rolls up his sleeves,
puts his sandwich in his lunch pail...

31:45.446 --> 31:48.074
...and brings jobs to the Tar Heel State.

31:48.241 --> 31:49.867
'Yes!
'Yes!

31:54.539 --> 31:55.832
What the hell?

31:58.501 --> 32:01.254
Let's bring back corporations
to North Carolina.

32:01.421 --> 32:03.381
Let's clean up D.C.

32:03.548 --> 32:07.593
And bring your brooms, because it's a mess.

32:18.062 --> 32:22.233
There was a clear winner in the first debate.
Marty Huggins simply electrified this crowd.

32:22.400 --> 32:25.236
Two hours ago, this congressional
race was dead on arrival.

32:25.403 --> 32:28.865
- That was real nice, Marty.
- I was jacked. I don't know what I was saying.

32:29.031 --> 32:31.659
- Doesn't matter. You killed it.
- Marty. Here he is.

32:31.826 --> 32:34.162
Rumpelscrotskin,
you been doing so good up there.

32:34.328 --> 32:35.621
Who did this to you?

32:35.788 --> 32:37.957
You could not have been doing this
on your own.

32:38.124 --> 32:40.293
Oh. I want you to meet Becky.
Becky, this is Marty.

32:40.460 --> 32:42.503
- Hey, Marty.
- Hey, Becky.

32:42.670 --> 32:43.880
Wow, you were great.

32:44.046 --> 32:46.757
- I thought you were married to Mindy.
- I am. This is Becky.

32:46.924 --> 32:49.427
Your brother said I could dance
in your campaign video.

32:49.594 --> 32:53.139
I have a lot of experience.
I worked for Jumbo's and Crazy Girls.

32:53.306 --> 32:55.433
- Fantastic.
- Well, well, well. Tim Wattley.

32:55.600 --> 32:59.729
- You really outdone yourself this time.
- Gentlemen. Very spirited debate.

32:59.896 --> 33:01.272
- Hey, Cam.
- Hey, Becky.

33:01.439 --> 33:02.482
Hey, Becky.

33:02.648 --> 33:05.359
Well, if you'll excuse us,
we've got some babies to kiss.

33:05.526 --> 33:06.903
Okay.

33:07.111 --> 33:09.071
It was like I was another person,
you know?

33:09.238 --> 33:12.033
I actually have a baby I need to kiss
right down there.

33:12.200 --> 33:16.287
- What's the matter with him?
- This is my district. That's my baby.

33:16.454 --> 33:19.248
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me, please.

33:20.249 --> 33:22.960
Oh. Oh, you don't take a swing at my hair.

33:26.422 --> 33:28.633
You little fucker.

33:42.355 --> 33:44.565
No!

33:49.570 --> 33:51.239
Oh, shit.

33:58.246 --> 34:02.708
<i>Bizarre news coming out of the 14th district
congressional race in North Carolina.</i>

34:02.875 --> 34:08.255
<i>Now, get this: Cam Brady,
four-time congressman, punched a baby.</i>

34:08.422 --> 34:11.842
<i>This is likely to hurt him with the
Christian right, social conservatives.</i>

34:12.009 --> 34:14.804
<i>Really any group
that opposes baby-punching.</i>

34:14.971 --> 34:17.223
<i>Baby is fine, and he said he punches
like a 3-year-old.</i>

34:18.975 --> 34:21.018
<i>After Cam Brady's baby-punching incident...</i>

34:21.185 --> 34:24.522
<i>...Marty Huggins has jumped 11 points
in the polls.</i>

34:25.231 --> 34:28.985
That is totally taken out of context.

34:29.150 --> 34:31.445
Well, not really.
I mean, you punched that baby.

34:31.612 --> 34:33.531
Is anyone asking how my hand feels...

34:33.697 --> 34:37.784
...after punching that iron-like jaw
of that baby?

34:37.952 --> 34:40.621
- How is your hand?
- I can't even make a fist.

34:40.788 --> 34:43.623
I tell you right now, though,
I'm so angered by seeing that...

34:43.791 --> 34:46.293
...I wish I could go out
and punch that baby again.

34:46.460 --> 34:49.839
We're getting killed. You're the
best campaign-ad guy in the business.

34:50.005 --> 34:53.259
I got something that's gonna help.
We tried to take a negative...

34:53.426 --> 34:57.471
...okay, your recent scandals, and show
the positive side of that negative.

34:58.139 --> 34:59.724
Take a look.

34:59.890 --> 35:02.018
<i>Cam Brady has come under fire...</i>

35:02.184 --> 35:05.313
<i>...for getting it on with this woman,
Shana St. Croix...</i>

35:05.479 --> 35:09.567
<i>...a former professional cheerleader
and part-time aerobics instructor...</i>

35:09.734 --> 35:11.068
<i>...who can do this.</i>

35:12.737 --> 35:14.322
<i>And this.</i>

35:15.156 --> 35:17.074
- Yes, she can.
- Okay.

35:17.241 --> 35:19.535
<i>Shouldn't our leaders be men we admire?</i>

35:19.702 --> 35:23.706
<i>We can go into all the great things
Cam's done as a congressman...</i>

35:23.873 --> 35:26.584
<i>...or we can just show some more
of this little honey.</i>

35:28.461 --> 35:30.004
<i>Vote for Cam Brady...</i>

35:30.171 --> 35:34.175
...a real American man.

35:34.800 --> 35:37.511
- I don't know. What do you think?
- Oh, I fucking love it.

35:38.721 --> 35:41.057
Shana's gonna love it too.
She looks so hot in it.

35:41.223 --> 35:42.266
Jesus, Cam.

35:42.433 --> 35:45.936
Well, let me tell you something.
This spot tested through the roof with men.

35:46.103 --> 35:48.022
- I knew it.
- Now, here's the downside.

35:48.189 --> 35:49.523
Horrible numbers with women.

35:49.690 --> 35:51.108
- You don't say.
- Horrible?

35:51.275 --> 35:53.986
- Yeah, that's not a surprise to me.
- Worst we've ever seen.

35:54.153 --> 35:55.237
- You're kidding me.
- No.

35:55.404 --> 35:59.408
- "Worst" as in...?
- In the history of numbers.

35:59.575 --> 36:00.910
Yeah, that's lower than I thought.

36:01.077 --> 36:05.414
Okay, now, this is a spot to raise some
important questions in the minds of voters.

36:05.581 --> 36:08.084
We're calling it "Homeland insecurity."

36:08.250 --> 36:09.627
- Ha, ha.
- Check it out.

36:09.794 --> 36:12.004
<i>Al-Qaeda. The Taliban.</i>

36:12.171 --> 36:13.923
I hate those guys.

36:14.090 --> 36:17.093
<i>One thing unites all of them
in their blood pacts:</i>

36:17.259 --> 36:18.844
<i>facial hair.</i>

36:19.011 --> 36:22.390
<i>There's someone else, North Carolina,
that has facial hair:</i>

36:22.556 --> 36:23.933
<i>Marty Huggins.</i>

36:24.100 --> 36:25.142
- Right.
- Right?

36:25.309 --> 36:27.478
<i>Why doesn't Marty Huggins
answer the question?</i>

36:27.645 --> 36:29.438
<i>Is he a Taliban or an al Qaeda?</i>

36:29.605 --> 36:30.690
Are you kidding me?

36:30.856 --> 36:33.526
<i>Why does Marty Huggins
refuse to take a lie-detector test?</i>

36:33.693 --> 36:34.735
Why won't he?

36:34.902 --> 36:37.363
<i>And where exactly
was Marty Huggins on 9/11?</i>

36:37.530 --> 36:38.864
- Bingo.
- Okay.

36:39.031 --> 36:41.992
<i>There's just too many questions.</i>

36:43.411 --> 36:45.913
Boy, that is solid too. Real solid.

36:46.080 --> 36:47.915
- Yes.
- Uh, Rick, let me ask you this.

36:48.082 --> 36:52.837
Has there been any sort of correlation
between Huggins and, heh, Islamic radicals?

36:53.003 --> 36:54.964
- I mean, at all?
- None that I know of.

36:55.131 --> 36:57.883
What... I think what Rick's trying
to illustrate with that...

36:58.050 --> 37:01.262
...is there's still a heck of a
lot of questions about this guy.

37:01.429 --> 37:03.514
- Spot on.
- How are we gonna pay for these?

37:03.681 --> 37:07.643
We're gonna run them both. Let's turn
the heat up on Mr. Marty Huggins.

37:09.854 --> 37:13.190
Gentlemen, we're really counting
on your support.

37:13.733 --> 37:19.196
The guys at Goldman Sachs are prepared
to donate $500,000 to your super PAC.

37:19.363 --> 37:22.408
Provided, of course,
you pick up the phone any time we call.

37:22.575 --> 37:23.993
That's not gonna be a problem.

37:24.160 --> 37:26.787
If you give us a million, hell,
I'll let you sleep with my wife.

37:29.039 --> 37:33.669
- And for 1.5, I'll throw in my cousin.
- I don't know if you want her cousin.

37:33.836 --> 37:35.087
That might drive the price down.

37:35.254 --> 37:37.006
- No, she lost weight.
- Oh.

37:37.173 --> 37:40.134
Mrs. Brady, are you playing footsie
with me under the table?

37:40.301 --> 37:41.427
Nope, that's me.

37:43.512 --> 37:45.514
He's a switch-hitter.

37:45.723 --> 37:47.433
- Oh, no.
- No, no.

37:47.600 --> 37:52.646
No. I did once. I did once, in college.
Yes. Which we've never talked about.

37:53.647 --> 37:56.025
It goes without saying,
this lunch never happened.

38:00.529 --> 38:02.740
This question is for the congressman.

38:02.907 --> 38:08.370
Why have you consistently voted
against campaign-finance reform?

38:08.537 --> 38:09.580
Yeah.

38:09.747 --> 38:12.249
We all know big money
is running this country.

38:12.416 --> 38:14.710
- That's right.
- Do they run you?

38:14.877 --> 38:16.754
Yeah!

38:17.463 --> 38:18.506
Hold on.

38:18.672 --> 38:23.135
Why don't we stop all the softball questions
and ask some real questions, okay?

38:23.302 --> 38:26.764
Like why won't Marty Huggins here
take a lie-detector test?

38:26.931 --> 38:28.766
- Yeah. Take the test.
- Yeah.

38:28.933 --> 38:31.977
- Yeah.
- Is he an al Qaeda? Is he a Taliban?

38:32.144 --> 38:34.271
Congressman, please.

38:34.438 --> 38:37.566
I've seen a mustache like that before,
and you know who wore it?

38:37.733 --> 38:39.109
Saddam Hussein.

38:39.276 --> 38:43.948
And I believe we never caught two
of his sons, Uday and Falafel.

38:45.825 --> 38:48.118
I am not beholden to
Cam Brady's accusations.

38:48.285 --> 38:49.787
I am beholden to only one man...

38:49.954 --> 38:52.665
...and that is the greatest American
that has ever lived:

38:52.832 --> 38:57.253
Jesus Christ.
Who happened to have a mustache.

38:57.419 --> 39:01.173
There you go, Marty. Amen, Marty.
Jesus loves you, Marty.

39:01.757 --> 39:03.551
Cam Brady, is it true...

39:03.717 --> 39:07.012
...that you have not been to church
in over nine months?

39:07.179 --> 39:10.558
Good question. CAM: First
of all, my relationship to God...

39:10.724 --> 39:13.811
...is not measured by taking attendance.

39:15.271 --> 39:16.313
Hallelujah.

39:16.480 --> 39:20.568
Well, as a Christian, I guess that it would
be easy for you to recite the Lord's Prayer.

39:20.734 --> 39:24.113
Is that what we're resorting to here?
Gestapo tactics?

39:24.280 --> 39:25.531
I would like to hear that.

39:25.698 --> 39:27.950
Would you like to hear him
say the Lord's Prayer?

39:29.535 --> 39:31.704
- You heard the man.
- Fine, I'm happy to. Ahem.

39:31.871 --> 39:34.874
If the media wouldn't mind
turning off their recording devices...

39:35.040 --> 39:38.836
...and closing their eyes as well,
we can start with the Lord's Prayer.

39:39.003 --> 39:41.088
Our father...

39:41.964 --> 39:44.258
...Art, who is up in heaven...

39:44.425 --> 39:46.427
...aloe vera be thy name...

39:49.054 --> 39:50.389
<i>Thy. Thy.</i>
- The thigh.

39:51.223 --> 39:53.142
Thy kingdom...

39:53.309 --> 39:55.644
Thy kingdom come.

39:56.228 --> 39:57.313
The magic kingdom.

39:57.479 --> 39:59.148
As it is on earth...

39:59.857 --> 40:01.525
...in a helicopter.

40:01.692 --> 40:04.069
Give us this day our daily...

40:04.737 --> 40:07.197
...pizza and let us digest it.

40:07.364 --> 40:09.491
Forgive us...

40:10.576 --> 40:12.077
Pass.

40:12.244 --> 40:17.583
Forgive our passes we commit sometimes
on womenfolk...

40:17.750 --> 40:22.129
...with their dresses that are too tight. Like,
that's a nice caboose you got on your...

40:23.505 --> 40:25.841
You know what?
That's not part of it, I know that.

40:26.550 --> 40:28.093
Keep your heads bowed, please.

40:28.260 --> 40:31.221
Forgive us for trespassing...

40:31.388 --> 40:33.807
...and do not lead us to the Temptations.

40:33.974 --> 40:36.894
Because we are tired of them
and their dancing.

40:37.394 --> 40:42.149
And deliver us from evil
with your mighty sword and falcon...

40:42.316 --> 40:44.026
...forever and ever and ever. Amen.

40:44.193 --> 40:46.028
Amen.

40:46.445 --> 40:48.280
- That wasn't right.
- He doesn't know it.

40:48.447 --> 40:51.033
- He does not know the Lord's Prayer.
- It's pretty close.

40:51.200 --> 40:52.576
I know the essence.

40:52.743 --> 40:57.915
I think we can all agree.
Cam Brady, he's a mess.

40:58.082 --> 41:01.627
All I know, if you say, "it's a mess,"
you don't support our troops.

41:01.794 --> 41:04.213
Cam Brady '012.
I was the last one to say something.

41:04.380 --> 41:05.422
Yeah, baby.

41:05.589 --> 41:10.469
<i>Marty! Marty! Marty! Marty! Marty! Marty!</i>

41:10.803 --> 41:14.765

You got one.

<i>- Every day

41:23.774 --> 41:26.235
Thank you for having me
at your congregation.

41:26.402 --> 41:31.490
First time I've worn a Yamaha. It fits nicely.
How do you say "it's a mess" in Hebrew?

41:32.866 --> 41:33.909
Donkey Kong?

41:36.662 --> 41:38.789
I have the faith in me.

41:38.956 --> 41:40.332
- Hallelujah.
- Yeah. All right.

41:40.499 --> 41:43.085
Mitch, I could do this forever.
These snakes love me.

41:45.421 --> 41:48.757
Goddamn it. Fucking son of a fuck.

41:48.924 --> 41:52.302
Oh, the fucking cunt-ass serpent bit me!

41:52.845 --> 41:58.267
Oh, jam a lit sparkler up my dickhole.
That is painful.

41:58.434 --> 42:02.146
Staple my tits to my balls
and then do sit-ups. It hurts.

42:02.312 --> 42:06.150
Sir, words like that
have never been spoken in this room.

42:06.316 --> 42:09.737
But the fucker bit me.
I'm sorry, the snake bit me.

42:09.903 --> 42:13.907
- Which means you don't have the faith of God.
- Yeah... Yes, I do.

42:14.074 --> 42:18.662
God has removed the venom from my blood
and the blasphemy from my heart.

42:19.121 --> 42:21.957
- It's a miracle.
- It's a miracle.

42:22.124 --> 42:24.251
Hallelujah.

42:25.627 --> 42:29.882
- I can't feel anything. It's F'd up.
- Hey, you okay?

42:31.341 --> 42:34.136
Hey, Cam. Come on, we gotta go.

42:34.303 --> 42:37.848
I feel like I'm maintaining.
Am I maintaining, Mitch?

42:38.015 --> 42:42.102
- No, you're not. You look horrible. Come on.
- Let's get a couple of burritos.

42:50.611 --> 42:51.653
Oh, my God.

42:51.820 --> 42:56.366
Cam. Cam! Where'd he go?

42:57.117 --> 42:59.244
- He has ascended.
- Cam!

42:59.411 --> 43:00.996
It's a miracle.

43:03.916 --> 43:07.586
I gotta cool down. I gotta cool down. Oh.

43:07.753 --> 43:11.465
Oh, the venom's coursing through my veins.

43:12.633 --> 43:14.259
Suck the venom out.

43:14.468 --> 43:18.013
Oh! The venom's giving me an erection.

43:19.139 --> 43:22.476
I need... I need roughage. I need roughage.

43:41.453 --> 43:42.496
Oh.

43:42.663 --> 43:47.459
Oh, I landed on Nazareth,
and I would like to buy a manger.

44:01.098 --> 44:05.602
Cam Brady, have you not wrought enough evil
on this home?!

44:10.774 --> 44:12.317
Why?!

44:14.361 --> 44:16.780
Don't worry, we're gonna get you home,
get you a couple Advil.

44:16.947 --> 44:18.115

44:30.544 --> 44:33.046
Cam Brady got a two-point bump out of a...

44:33.213 --> 44:37.801
- I was watching that.
- No, Marty. We have to talk.

44:37.968 --> 44:40.804
You're never home,
and when you are, it's all politics.

44:40.971 --> 44:43.265
Gosh, I am so flustered.

44:43.432 --> 44:45.851
Everybody's got me
running every which way but loose.

44:46.018 --> 44:50.022
I just wanna get back to the basics.
I miss you.

44:51.023 --> 44:54.234
Let's just have one night like we used to.

44:54.401 --> 44:56.904
No Tim Wattley.

44:57.070 --> 44:58.947
Just the family.

44:59.114 --> 45:01.408
That sounds like a little slice of heaven.

45:27.643 --> 45:30.312
What the fuck is going on in here?

45:30.479 --> 45:34.274
You kids go upstairs,
wash your filthy faces, and get to bed.

45:34.441 --> 45:35.484
Hurry UP!

45:35.651 --> 45:37.819
Are you gonna let him
talk to our children that way?

45:37.986 --> 45:40.948
- Let me handle this.
- I know you're Marty's wife, but I swear...

45:41.114 --> 45:42.699
...get out before I lose my shit.

45:42.866 --> 45:44.451
- Marty.
- Now, Mr. Wattley.

45:44.618 --> 45:49.498
Marty, I need you kicking Cam's balls in
on a daily basis.

45:49.665 --> 45:54.336
And I come here and find you playing
<i>Hee Haw</i> with the fuck-around gang.

45:54.503 --> 45:58.632
- Oh, he's drunk. You're drunk.
- Yeah, I'm a little lit. So what?

45:58.799 --> 46:02.719
You have an opportunity to win this thing.

46:04.680 --> 46:06.139
Do you really think so?

46:06.306 --> 46:10.269
You promised me this dog could hunt.

46:12.437 --> 46:14.481
Can you do that?

46:15.315 --> 46:17.150
Yes, I can, Mr. Wattley.

46:19.903 --> 46:21.321
That's my boy.

46:22.614 --> 46:26.368
I think I'm gonna take the children
and go stay at my mother's for the night.

46:26.535 --> 46:28.954
Mitzi, this will all be over
as soon as I win, okay?

46:29.121 --> 46:30.289
I promise.

46:30.455 --> 46:35.711
Just remember, Marty, what you're
giving up for what you're getting.

46:41.508 --> 46:43.093
Come here.

46:44.928 --> 46:45.971
Yeah?

46:47.639 --> 46:50.392
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, Camo, what's going on?

46:50.559 --> 46:53.895
Hey, uh, I just wanna let you know
that I'm running for class president.

46:54.354 --> 46:57.774
Good for you. Come on in, have a seat.

46:57.941 --> 47:01.278
So, uh, what are the issues you're gonna
run on? Figure that out yet?

47:01.445 --> 47:04.197
No, no, that's boring.
Nobody really cares about that.

47:05.282 --> 47:06.825
But I did spread a rumor...

47:06.992 --> 47:10.579
...that my opponent, Tommy Monahan,
may or may not have a vagina.

47:11.621 --> 47:14.666
- That could work, yeah.
- It will work.

47:14.833 --> 47:18.086
Win at all costs, right, Dad?
You taught me that.

47:18.253 --> 47:20.839
- Yeah, I guess I did.
- Learned from the best.

47:24.885 --> 47:28.597
<i>These dreams go on when I close my eyes</i>

47:28.764 --> 47:30.390

What are you doing here?
It's 11:00 at night.

47:39.274 --> 47:42.527
I know. But, uh... But we need to talk.

47:45.447 --> 47:47.240
Are you wearing a hidden camera?

47:49.201 --> 47:53.413
- Tam...? Do I know Tamara?
- I said, are you wearing a hidden camera?

47:53.580 --> 47:56.291
Heh, heh. No.

47:57.209 --> 48:00.003
The black button looks
like it has a lens in it.

48:00.837 --> 48:02.381
Cut.

48:04.508 --> 48:08.178
Look, I came over here tonight...

48:09.805 --> 48:12.516
...and I just wanted you to know...

48:14.267 --> 48:16.978
...that I just think
things have gotten crazy.

48:18.188 --> 48:19.898
And...

48:21.274 --> 48:22.901
...I want it to stop.

48:23.068 --> 48:25.654
- Cam, do you think I'm an idiot?
- I do not.

48:25.821 --> 48:28.490
Okay, then take off that camera, please.

48:28.698 --> 48:33.203
I'm sorry, it's a habit of mine. I just... I'm
so used to wearing one of these things...

48:33.370 --> 48:36.873
...because I'm afraid someone's taping me,
so I tape them.

48:38.583 --> 48:40.210
Yeah, it's okay.

48:40.377 --> 48:42.838
- Where are my manners? Come on in.
- Thank you.

48:44.047 --> 48:45.841
What is this we have here?

48:46.007 --> 48:50.971
It's a small-batch bourbon.
By-product of the prohibition days.

48:51.471 --> 48:55.308
Mm. Oh, wow. Thank you. That is smooth.

48:56.768 --> 48:58.728
- It's good.
- It's good, yeah.

49:01.523 --> 49:04.568
- Ah.
- Well...

49:07.654 --> 49:10.740
- Are they okay?
- What's that?

49:10.907 --> 49:12.242
Your Chinese dogs.

49:13.410 --> 49:17.247
Well, pugs were bred
with, uh, short snouts...

49:17.456 --> 49:21.168
- Mm.
- ...so they could lock in and take down lions.

49:21.793 --> 49:24.337
I find that hard to believe. Heh.

49:24.546 --> 49:27.215
You can Google it. It's worth a Google.

49:27.966 --> 49:33.180
Marty, I was thinking we could
make this campaign a little more civil...

49:33.346 --> 49:36.850
...if there were some way that you and I
could become friends.

49:37.017 --> 49:39.019
Well, I appreciate you saying that, Cam.

49:39.186 --> 49:43.732
The meanness and the nastiness
needs to stop.

49:44.357 --> 49:49.488
I mean, this race is for the people, isn't it?
It shouldn't be about us.

49:54.367 --> 49:56.786
Do your dogs ever go to a different room?

49:56.953 --> 49:59.956
- No, I like to have them nearby.
- Oh.

50:00.999 --> 50:04.085
You know when I first got into politics?

50:04.836 --> 50:06.755
The fifth grade. Heh.

50:06.922 --> 50:10.091
Out on the playground,
there was this jaggedy old jungle gym.

50:11.635 --> 50:15.263
<i>Rusty, sharp edges.
We used to call it Jim the Ripper.</i>

50:15.430 --> 50:18.016
It got me pretty good.

50:18.183 --> 50:21.394
Yeah, I remember that old jungle gym.

50:21.895 --> 50:23.563
Thank you.

50:24.314 --> 50:25.649
You're welcome.

50:25.815 --> 50:31.238
Well, in the fifth grade,
I ran for class president...

50:31.404 --> 50:32.864
...under one promise:

50:33.031 --> 50:37.202
<i>to take down the jaggedy jungle gym.</i>

50:39.371 --> 50:40.580
<i>And I won.</i>

50:40.747 --> 50:43.124
Well, that's a heartwarming story, Cam.

50:48.213 --> 50:49.256
Ah.

50:52.842 --> 50:54.678
Thank you.

50:54.844 --> 50:56.221
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

50:56.388 --> 50:58.181
We are...

50:58.348 --> 51:00.559
We are definitely going to CancÃºn.

51:01.851 --> 51:03.979
And you're not gonna pay for a thing.

51:04.145 --> 51:05.855
- Bye, Marty.
- Heh.

51:06.022 --> 51:08.191
- Hey, Cam?
- Yeah?

51:08.358 --> 51:11.152
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, you too.

51:11.319 --> 51:12.445
Oh, man. Whew.

51:18.910 --> 51:21.037
You know what to do, Marty.

51:25.917 --> 51:27.252
<i>Hammond Police.</i>

51:27.419 --> 51:30.463
Yes, I'd like to report
a drunk driver, please.

51:30.630 --> 51:35.969
<i>He's going to D-D. C. to be VP</i>

51:36.177 --> 51:37.220
Whoo!

51:37.387 --> 51:38.888
<i>Barracuda</i>

51:41.725 --> 51:45.061
Oh, fuck. Fuck me.

51:53.194 --> 51:56.323
- In God we must. OFFICER: Sir,
please get out of the vehicle.

51:56.489 --> 51:58.283
You have a great night.

51:58.450 --> 51:59.784
- Sir?
- Huh?

51:59.951 --> 52:02.954
- Please get out of the vehicle.
- Get out of the... You know what? Absolutely.

52:03.121 --> 52:06.333
And thank you for doing your job.
I appreciate it.

52:06.499 --> 52:10.670
Also, thank you for releasing me
upon my own recognizance.

52:14.716 --> 52:16.051
Sir, have you been drinking?

52:16.217 --> 52:19.054
Yes, I have.
I've had five or six small-batch bourbons.

52:19.220 --> 52:21.890
That's a lot. I'm gonna have to ask you
to take a Breathalyzer test.

52:22.057 --> 52:23.183
Mm-hm.

52:23.350 --> 52:26.686
We got a runner. Stop running!

52:29.814 --> 52:33.735
- Try to catch me, Ranger Rick.
- Stop!

52:34.903 --> 52:38.156
Oh, yeah. Okay. Oh, yeah.

52:38.323 --> 52:39.449
Oh, whoo!

52:39.616 --> 52:41.534
- Chase.
- Stop the vehicle! Stop the vehicle!

52:41.701 --> 52:44.204
Look what I'm doing.
I handled this perfectly.

52:45.580 --> 52:48.958
This car's so powerful. Oh, yeah.

52:49.125 --> 52:51.044
<i>What's your present location?</i>

52:51.211 --> 52:55.423
Oh, wait, this is not my car.
Oh, man. This is not my car.

52:55.590 --> 52:58.218
I don't have a gun in my car.

52:59.636 --> 53:03.515
Take the car back.
Okay, play it cool. Play it cool.

53:03.682 --> 53:07.977
He's not gonna notice. Uh-uh.
He's not gonna notice.

53:08.144 --> 53:11.481
Control my breathing.
I gotta control my breathing.

53:11.648 --> 53:13.900
Oh, no. Easy, slow.

53:14.067 --> 53:17.404
- Stop the vehicle now!
- Officer, are you in need of assistance?

53:17.570 --> 53:19.114
- I'm back up.
- Stop the vehicle.

53:19.280 --> 53:21.324
- I'm back up. I...
- Stop the vehicle now.

53:21.491 --> 53:22.534
I see you.

53:22.701 --> 53:24.327
- Stop the vehicle.
- No, I see you.

53:24.494 --> 53:27.414
- Get out of the vehicle.
- Hey, here's the good news. I came back.

53:27.580 --> 53:30.709
Let's just talk about this. Oof. Hey.

53:33.169 --> 53:35.046
- He fucking set me up, Mitch.
- I know it.

53:35.213 --> 53:39.342
I mean, I showed one moment of weakness,
and then he struck like a cobra.

53:39.509 --> 53:43.596
- Absolutely. Hey, guys. How you doing?
- You were charged with drunk driving.

53:43.763 --> 53:45.390
Is it true you blew a 1.4?

53:45.557 --> 53:48.226
Let's also remember
that a responsible number of drinks...

53:48.393 --> 53:50.395
...makes your body looser in car accidents.

53:50.562 --> 53:54.107
- You actually suffer less injuries.
- Are you advocating drinking and driving?

53:54.274 --> 53:57.527
Thank you for your help.
You guys do real good work. God bless you.

53:58.903 --> 54:01.030
- Goodness gracious.
- Oh, God.

54:01.197 --> 54:03.867
- I swear to God, I wanna run these people over.
- I don't blame you.

54:06.745 --> 54:09.456
Damn it. I am still way too drunk.

54:09.998 --> 54:12.041
We need to double up
our fundraising efforts.

54:12.208 --> 54:15.670
- If there's money out there, we get it.
- Right. That's what we're gonna do.

54:15.837 --> 54:18.173
Did you hear about this corporation
that came in...

54:18.339 --> 54:21.634
...and bought 50 foreclosed homes
in this district? What are you doing?

54:21.801 --> 54:25.013
All right. Anyway, they also bought
off a few closed-up factories.

54:25.180 --> 54:28.767
- You know anything about that?
- No, I've been trying to win an election.

54:28.933 --> 54:30.518
Hey, guys, I heard what happened.

54:30.685 --> 54:33.855
Listen, I wanna tell you,
we had nothing to do with that DUI.

54:34.022 --> 54:37.358
We don't run a negative campaign.
Need a ride?

54:40.111 --> 54:44.240
- Come on. We're not gonna fall for that.
- Come on.

54:44.407 --> 54:47.994
- Jump in.
- Why would you offer us a ride?

54:48.161 --> 54:51.414
I'm trying to make it up to you.
I'm not who you think I am.

54:51.581 --> 54:54.876
- Get in the car and I'll give you a ride.
- Are you sure?

54:55.043 --> 55:00.757
I swear. I swear on my mother's grave.
Okay? Isn't that enough? Come on.

55:00.924 --> 55:04.761
- We're gonna fit in that tiny little thing?
- Are you gonna make us pay for the gas?

55:04.928 --> 55:07.889
You know what? My treat.

55:09.641 --> 55:10.683
- Okay.
- All right.

55:10.850 --> 55:12.227
- Okay.
- Thank you.

55:12.393 --> 55:13.812
- This is very nice.
- Wonderful.

55:13.978 --> 55:17.315
The man's not gonna swear
on his mother's grave and then drive off...

55:21.069 --> 55:23.655
My mother's still alive!

55:23.822 --> 55:26.908
- What did he say?
- He said, "My mother is still alive."

55:27.075 --> 55:28.743
- Oh, that's how you beat that.
- Yeah.

55:28.910 --> 55:30.578
That's exactly how you beat it.

55:40.964 --> 55:42.131
I'm an American.

55:43.716 --> 55:47.595
And I believe in American ingenuity
and hard work.

55:47.762 --> 55:49.556
Unlike my friend here, Cam Brady...

55:49.722 --> 55:52.392
...who believes that everyone should live
in Rainbow Land.

55:54.102 --> 55:57.605
Douglas, I'd like to say one thing.
I'm an American too.

55:57.772 --> 56:02.360
And I have no idea what he's referring to
as Rainbow Land, okay?

56:02.527 --> 56:05.780
I'm referring to a 13-page doctrine...

56:05.947 --> 56:08.908
...written by Camden Brady...

56:09.075 --> 56:10.660
...called <i>Rainbow Land.</i>

56:10.827 --> 56:13.288
That's something I wrote
in the second grade.

56:13.997 --> 56:17.375
I think anybody that writes
about the redistribution of wealth...

56:17.542 --> 56:20.295
...sounds like a communist to me.

56:20.837 --> 56:22.505
- Am I right?
- Hold on.

56:22.672 --> 56:27.802
It is the simple story of a teddy bear
giving a pot of gold to a leprechaun, okay?

56:27.969 --> 56:31.180
- That's right.
- May I read from Page 7?

56:31.347 --> 56:32.807
Don't listen to him, Cam.

56:32.974 --> 56:35.852
"Please come with me to Rainbow Land...

56:36.019 --> 56:39.772
...where unicorns are made of fudge
and cotton candy...

56:39.939 --> 56:41.691
...and everything is free."

56:41.858 --> 56:45.278
It's a fictitious place.
Rainbow Land, it's fiction.

56:45.445 --> 56:48.114
I guess we're all idiots
according to Cam Brady.

56:48.281 --> 56:52.327
- I didn't say that. I did not say that.
- Hey! Hey!

56:52.493 --> 56:55.288
I do not want to live in Rainbow Land...

56:55.455 --> 56:58.833
...and you can't make me live
in Rainbow Land.

56:59.000 --> 57:01.044
- Yeah.
- This is America.

57:01.210 --> 57:03.254
You do not have to live in Rainbow Land.

57:03.421 --> 57:06.007
- You can go to Rainbow Land.
- It does not exist.

57:06.174 --> 57:09.469
It's a fictitious place. I was 8.
It's from a child's imagination.

57:09.636 --> 57:12.555
- It's right here in his communist manifesto.
- Oh, come on.

57:12.722 --> 57:15.725
- I won't go to Rainbow Land.
- Sit down.

57:15.892 --> 57:20.063
I said, sit the fuck down.
It doesn't exist.

57:20.229 --> 57:22.649
Go back to where you're from, dick.

57:22.815 --> 57:24.734
It's not a real place!

57:24.901 --> 57:28.112
How many times do I gotta say it?
It's not real!

57:29.197 --> 57:30.907
- What is he pointing at?
- Don't worry.

57:31.074 --> 57:32.825
- Is he pointing at me?
- He sure the fuck is.

57:32.992 --> 57:35.787
- Cam, you're a communist.
- He's talking shit about me again?

57:35.954 --> 57:37.622
- You pointing at me?
- What?

57:37.789 --> 57:39.624
- You pointing at me? You talking to me?
- Huh?

57:39.791 --> 57:42.126
- Fucking dickhead!
- What are you doing? Cam, no.

57:42.293 --> 57:44.170
- What did you...?
- No. No!

57:48.299 --> 57:49.592
No, no, no!

57:52.387 --> 57:55.556
Your nickname in school was Tickle Shits.
I'm gonna see if it's true.

57:55.723 --> 57:57.350
Don't you shit your pants, Marty.

57:57.517 --> 57:58.935
- Don't! Ha, ha!
- Go for his hair.

57:59.102 --> 58:01.729
- You do not touch the hair.
- Don't you touch my hair.

58:01.896 --> 58:04.357
- It's a $900 haircut.
- Don't talk about that, Cam.

58:04.524 --> 58:06.609
I'm gonna kill you.

58:16.452 --> 58:20.498
<i>Remember the politician that punched a baby?
Well, he's at it again.</i>

58:20.665 --> 58:24.085
<i>He punched Uggie, the dog from
the Academy Award-winning film The Artist.</i>

58:24.252 --> 58:27.005
<i>Marty Huggins is solidly ahead.</i>

58:27.171 --> 58:30.967
Rainbow Land <i>is now number six
on Amazon.com.</i>

58:32.135 --> 58:34.137
Can't believe you
landed a national interview.

58:34.303 --> 58:36.848
- Mm-hm.
- This could really swing the campaign.

58:37.015 --> 58:39.976
Yeah, that's the idea.
Let's get this bad boy. Let's wrap it up.

58:40.143 --> 58:42.770
- How's the hair?
- Strong.

58:42.937 --> 58:44.647
- Yeah.
- So fucking strong.

58:44.814 --> 58:48.860
My hair could lift a car
off a baby if it had to.

58:49.027 --> 58:51.487
- Absolutely.
- It'd do it on its way to church.

58:51.654 --> 58:54.449
- Okay. Ready to do it? Let's do it.
- Ready. Let's go.

58:55.450 --> 58:57.994
<i>Good evening.
Welcome to Piers Morgan Tonight.</i>

58:58.161 --> 58:59.996
<i>We start tonight from North Carolina...</i>

59:00.163 --> 59:03.458
<i>...with one of the nation's ugliest
and most polarizing campaigns ever.</i>

59:03.624 --> 59:06.210
<i>- Our guest is Congressman Cam Brady.</i>
- Thank you, Piers.

59:06.377 --> 59:11.549
It is an honor to be on your show.
My wife, Rose, and I watch you every night.

59:11.716 --> 59:13.885
<i>That's very kind of you, congressman.</i>

59:14.052 --> 59:16.971
<i>It's well known the Motch brothers
are backing Marty Huggins...</i>

59:17.138 --> 59:19.057
<i>your opponent, with millions of dollars</i>

59:19.223 --> 59:21.684
<i>Is this election being bought
by the highest bidder?</i>

59:21.851 --> 59:26.814
Piers, this election is about
the freedom of choice, simple as that.

59:26.981 --> 59:30.568
Americans standing up for their freedom
and their right to choose...

59:30.735 --> 59:36.616
...whether it be in the great outdoors
or with four black friends at a jazz club.

59:36.783 --> 59:42.330
<i>Congressman, are you taking money
to promote Menthol 100s or not?</i>

59:42.497 --> 59:46.626
- Uh, come again? Did you say Menthol 100s?
<i>- I'm not saying the brand of cigarettes again.</i>

59:46.793 --> 59:49.754
<i>Are you taking money
from big tobacco companies?</i>

59:49.921 --> 59:52.256
No, no, no, I'm not.

59:52.590 --> 59:55.593
I just honestly enjoy
their cool, fresh taste.

59:55.760 --> 59:58.304
And the freshness that Menthol 100s...

59:58.471 --> 59:59.555
- Easy.
- Hey, come on.

59:59.722 --> 01:00:02.558
<i>- Congressman, let's get back on topic, please.</i>
- I'd love to.

01:00:02.725 --> 01:00:05.019
And what was that topic
we were talking about?

01:00:05.186 --> 01:00:07.480
Did it happen to be Coke Zero?

01:00:07.647 --> 01:00:09.649
<i>No, it was not Coke Zero.</i>

01:00:09.816 --> 01:00:14.362
Look, I'd like to say one thing:
Marty Huggins for Congress in '012.

01:00:14.529 --> 01:00:16.155
It's a mess.

01:00:16.322 --> 01:00:19.117
<i>You're taking money
from Marty Huggins' campaign?</i>

01:00:19.283 --> 01:00:23.412
<i>- To do a plug on my show?</i>
- Yes. I did take money from Marty Huggins.

01:00:23.579 --> 01:00:26.541
But you can rest assured that every dime...

01:00:26.707 --> 01:00:31.045
...every single dime,
will be used to defeat Marty Huggins.

01:00:31.212 --> 01:00:33.172
It's a mess.

01:00:33.339 --> 01:00:34.382
<i>Let's change topics.</i>

01:00:34.549 --> 01:00:37.343
<i>Let's get to the toll this race has had
on your marriage.</i>

01:00:37.510 --> 01:00:38.678
Oh, there's been no toll.

01:00:38.845 --> 01:00:42.265
I don't know why you would bring that up.
I find that laughable. Ha, ha.

01:00:42.431 --> 01:00:45.685
No, our campaign
is just so steady right now.

01:00:45.852 --> 01:00:50.606
We are really hitting our stride,
and my lovely wife is a rock.

01:00:50.773 --> 01:00:53.943
<i>Really? Well, as a special guest
from an undisclosed location...</i>

01:00:54.110 --> 01:00:56.028
<i>...let's introduce you to your wife.</i>

01:00:56.195 --> 01:00:57.613
<i>- Hello, Piers</i>
- Oh.

01:00:59.657 --> 01:01:02.743
- Honey, what are you doing in the kitchen?
<i>- I'm doing an interview.</i>

01:01:02.910 --> 01:01:05.371
- She's here in the house.
<i>- Yes.</i>

01:01:05.538 --> 01:01:08.249
She's... Come on up here.

01:01:08.416 --> 01:01:11.794
<i>Mrs. Brady, you've gone through
this election process four times now.</i>

01:01:11.961 --> 01:01:15.631
<i>- How has this race been different for you?
- Oh, it's just been terrible.</i>

01:01:15.798 --> 01:01:18.384
<i>For one, Cam has just completely
let his body go.</i>

01:01:18.551 --> 01:01:22.263
<i>It's just a whole mess of fat
and weirdly placed hair.</i>

01:01:22.430 --> 01:01:25.057
<i>It's like somebody dropped a glazed ham
in a barber shop.</i>

01:01:25.224 --> 01:01:27.977
- Okay, that... That's ridiculous.
- Oh, come on. Come on.

01:01:28.144 --> 01:01:31.105
<i>Do you think Cam is emotionally
stable enough to be in office?</i>

01:01:31.272 --> 01:01:32.940
<i>- I'm trying.</i>
- Oh, God, no.

01:01:33.107 --> 01:01:35.526
<i>- You can read all about it in my new book.</i>
- Aw, what?

01:01:35.693 --> 01:01:38.988
<i>I've sold the movie rights.
We're in talks with Kate Hudson to play me.</i>

01:01:39.155 --> 01:01:40.198
- No.
- No.

01:01:40.364 --> 01:01:43.075
<i>Cam will be played by Yaphet Kotto,
who you may remember...</i>

01:01:43.242 --> 01:01:46.537
<i>...from</i> Homicide: Life on the Streets.
- Okay, that's uncalled for.

01:01:46.704 --> 01:01:50.249
- Holy smokes. Done. You had your fun.
- This is over. Damn. You had your fun.

01:01:50.416 --> 01:01:52.919
You happy, New York? You had your fun.
Shut it down.

01:01:53.461 --> 01:01:56.631
Why would you do this?
You just killed the campaign.

01:01:56.797 --> 01:01:59.300
You're five points down.
You can't win this.

01:01:59.467 --> 01:02:01.886
I told you, I don't truck with losers.

01:02:02.053 --> 01:02:04.972
Plus, I got offered a lobbying job in D.C.
for Motch brothers.

01:02:05.139 --> 01:02:06.307
- The Motch brothers?
- Yup.

01:02:06.474 --> 01:02:08.851
You know what they're trying to do.
Get you to leave me.

01:02:09.018 --> 01:02:10.811
- You got your baton, baby?
- Yeah.

01:02:10.978 --> 01:02:12.939
Come on, baby, we're a team.
You're my rock.

01:02:15.441 --> 01:02:16.776
You're dragging me down, baby.

01:02:16.943 --> 01:02:19.612
What if my poll numbers go up?
Will you come back?

01:02:20.571 --> 01:02:23.532
I hate to do this to you, buddy,
but we got bigger problems.

01:02:25.159 --> 01:02:27.495
I think you need to see this.

01:02:27.662 --> 01:02:31.499

Cam Brady claims to be a family man.</i>

01:02:31.666 --> 01:02:33.251

01:02:33.417 --> 01:02:35.711
- Cam Jr.?
- Mm-hm.

01:02:35.878 --> 01:02:39.215
<i>- The batting cages, the water park.</i>
- Must be a hidden-camera situation.

01:02:39.382 --> 01:02:41.759
<i>You were doing cannonballs.
You were good at those.</i>

01:02:41.926 --> 01:02:44.470
- <i>Yeah.
- Seeing any girls yet?</i>

01:02:44.637 --> 01:02:46.514
- What is he doing?
- <i>Sort of.</i>

01:02:46.681 --> 01:02:50.101
<i>Must be tough having your dad
not be around that much, you know?</i>

01:02:50.268 --> 01:02:52.812
What is he talking about?
I'm around too much.

01:02:52.979 --> 01:02:54.188
<i>I could be your dad.</i>

01:02:56.107 --> 01:02:59.193

- No.

- <i>Go ahead, try.</i>
- No, don't do it.

01:03:02.238 --> 01:03:04.156
- No, I'm your daddy.
- <i>Go ahead.</i>

01:03:07.994 --> 01:03:09.870
<i>- Dad.</i>
- Oh, shit.

01:03:10.037 --> 01:03:12.206

<i>Marty Huggins,

01:03:26.429 --> 01:03:29.682
Just take it easy. All right?
Just take a deep breath.

01:03:29.849 --> 01:03:32.810
Now, we ought to think about
how we gonna get back, okay?

01:03:32.977 --> 01:03:35.730
But we can't let emotion
cloud our judgment, okay?

01:03:35.896 --> 01:03:38.983
We gotta think logically here.
Now, what do you wanna do?

01:03:39.150 --> 01:03:40.818
I'm gonna fuck his wife.

01:03:40.985 --> 01:03:43.988
Great. No. No, you can't do that.
No, no, no.

01:03:44.155 --> 01:03:47.408
I'm gonna fuck his wife,
and I'm gonna go put it on television.

01:03:47.575 --> 01:03:49.410
No. Okay, you definitely can't do that.

01:03:49.577 --> 01:03:52.663
First part, maybe,
but the second part, definitely not.

01:03:52.830 --> 01:03:53.998
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

01:03:54.165 --> 01:03:58.878
You get my son to call you "Daddy,"
I fuck your wife.

01:03:59.045 --> 01:04:01.005
- That's the deal?
- That is the deal.

01:04:01.172 --> 01:04:02.340
What are you pointing at?

01:04:02.506 --> 01:04:06.010
- Got a book of bad ideas?
- I got a book of good ideas. That's the first one.

01:04:06.177 --> 01:04:09.138
Get my son to call you "Daddy"...

01:04:09.638 --> 01:04:12.266
...turn the page, it
says, "Fuck your wife."

01:04:12.433 --> 01:04:14.518
Okay, let's talk about this.

Coming.

01:04:28.574 --> 01:04:30.117
Congressman Brady.

01:04:30.284 --> 01:04:33.371
Marty's down at the tourism office, so...

01:04:33.537 --> 01:04:35.956
I really like your hair.

01:04:36.123 --> 01:04:37.708
It's very Katie Couric.

01:04:38.584 --> 01:04:40.336
Thank you.

Cal Tjader. Best known
for starting the samba-salsa jazz craze.

01:04:54.058 --> 01:05:00.106
Yet sadly, was not recognized
for a Grammy for over 40 years.

01:05:03.359 --> 01:05:07.238
I find it tragic when someone
isn't recognized for perfection.

01:05:07.655 --> 01:05:10.282
That's very interesting.

01:05:10.449 --> 01:05:12.410
Tell me something about you.

01:05:13.452 --> 01:05:16.205
Oh, uh, well, I love owls.

01:05:16.372 --> 01:05:18.541
I collect them, you know.
Not real ones, of course.

01:05:18.707 --> 01:05:20.584
But I got some porcelain
or maybe china ones.

01:05:21.961 --> 01:05:25.923
There's some pretty grumpy ones too that
kind of have those big eyebrows, like...

01:05:26.090 --> 01:05:28.384
Oh, God,
I know exactly what you're talking about.

01:05:28.551 --> 01:05:30.761
- I'm gonna let these little fellas out.
- Oh.

01:05:30.928 --> 01:05:33.722
Come on, little buddies. Come on.

01:05:37.810 --> 01:05:39.478
Get out, you little fuckers.

01:05:41.063 --> 01:05:43.315
They are tiny little munchkin butts,
aren't they?

01:05:43.482 --> 01:05:46.152
They're Marty's dogs.
They don't listen to me.

01:05:46.694 --> 01:05:49.905
Well, I don't understand that,
because I find you fascinating.

01:05:50.072 --> 01:05:51.532
Oh, thank you.

01:05:52.199 --> 01:05:54.952
Mitzi, I'm gonna out to the chase.

01:05:56.537 --> 01:05:58.789
I've had feelings for you.

01:06:01.709 --> 01:06:05.129
- Are we doing what I think we're doing?
- I don't know.

01:06:05.296 --> 01:06:09.592
I tell you right now, my heart is beating
like a phone book in a dryer...

01:06:09.758 --> 01:06:13.888
...and I'm so afraid
of what's about to happen.

01:06:14.054 --> 01:06:16.307
What's about to happen?

01:06:17.183 --> 01:06:18.642
This.

01:06:25.858 --> 01:06:27.735
Ooh.

01:06:28.694 --> 01:06:30.696
Ooh.

01:06:30.863 --> 01:06:32.781
- Ooh!
- Oh.

01:06:32.948 --> 01:06:37.369
I want you to put my head in the freezer
while you do me from behind.

01:06:37.536 --> 01:06:41.624
- Hold on, hold on. Isn't the freezer too high?
- I'll get a stool!

01:06:42.082 --> 01:06:45.503
Easy. Easy, Mitzi. Easy.

years with you, by your side.

I'm pretty goddamn disappointed.

01:08:47.457 --> 01:08:49.167
I'm sorry.

But I'm a poli sci major in college.

01:09:07.227 --> 01:09:10.229
Okay, well, guess what, Jason.
You're running my campaign.

01:09:10.397 --> 01:09:12.899
- Are you serious?
- Congratulations to Jason, everyone.

01:09:13.067 --> 01:09:15.402
- Nice round of applause.
- I got so many good ideas.

01:09:15.569 --> 01:09:18.572
Did you know that our government,
we actually give tax breaks to companies...

01:09:18.738 --> 01:09:22.201
...that outsource jobs to other countries?
That's awful.

01:09:22.368 --> 01:09:25.453
We've already lost 7 million jobs
since NAFTA, right?

01:09:25.621 --> 01:09:29.541
You get the fuck out of here.
You get the fuck out of here.

01:09:29.750 --> 01:09:33.879
I don't wanna hear that bullshit.
Hey, what did you major in in college?

01:09:34.046 --> 01:09:36.006
- You!
- Uh, sports marketing.

01:09:36.173 --> 01:09:40.469
Okay. You're running my campaign.

01:10:09.957 --> 01:10:11.625

...thirsty, alone and tired.

And then I find a wife who's forced me
to wear the horns of a cuckold.

01:10:24.805 --> 01:10:29.017
Look, Marty, I definitely did wrong.

01:10:29.184 --> 01:10:33.439
But do you know this is the first time
you've actually talked to me in weeks?

01:10:33.605 --> 01:10:36.483
The entire country is talking
about what you did.

01:10:36.650 --> 01:10:38.193
I know.

01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:40.821
Tim says I gotta kick you out...

01:10:40.988 --> 01:10:44.658
...or else I'll look weak
and I'll lose the election.

01:10:44.825 --> 01:10:48.120
When did Tim Wattley
become part of this family?

01:10:52.583 --> 01:10:55.627
Why don't you make up
your own mind, Marty?

01:10:56.503 --> 01:10:58.839
I think you should leave, Mitzi.

01:10:59.798 --> 01:11:01.925
At least until the election's over.

01:11:02.509 --> 01:11:05.721
And then what?
You'll be the old Marty again?

01:11:05.888 --> 01:11:08.182
- And what if you win?
- Well...

01:11:08.348 --> 01:11:12.978
- Marty, you should've never entered this race.
- Well, Cam Brady should've never entered you.

01:11:13.562 --> 01:11:16.315
- Tim told me to say that.
- Gross.

01:11:17.608 --> 01:11:19.359
Goodbye, Marty.

01:11:23.197 --> 01:11:25.866
We're out of Honey Nut Cheerios.

01:11:26.074 --> 01:11:30.370
Check the pantry. There's some Froot Loops.

01:11:31.371 --> 01:11:32.831
Okay, so here's the deal.

01:11:32.998 --> 01:11:35.542
If I bag a buck,
we'll get a nice bounce in the polls.

01:11:35.709 --> 01:11:39.671
So, what I did is I bought a dead
seven-point buck, I froze it...

01:11:39.838 --> 01:11:42.090
...and I put it out by
the lake in the woods.

01:11:42.257 --> 01:11:44.468
It's probably defrosted by about now.

01:11:44.635 --> 01:11:47.763
So get the photographers ready when I yell.

01:11:47.930 --> 01:11:50.849
That's an awesome plan, congressman.
What's the signal?

01:11:51.016 --> 01:11:53.352
Well, you'll hear a gunshot,
and then you'll hear me yell:

01:11:53.519 --> 01:11:54.978
"Black Hawk down!"

01:11:55.145 --> 01:11:58.565
That makes sense. Hey.

01:12:01.944 --> 01:12:05.656
Marty Huggins.
I didn't realize you were a sportsman.

01:12:05.823 --> 01:12:08.867
Sorry about that thing with your wife.
You know politics.

01:12:09.785 --> 01:12:13.831
Ho...! He shot me.
Black Hawk down! Black Hawk down!

01:12:13.997 --> 01:12:17.042
- You saw it. You all saw it.
- Way to go, Marty.

01:12:17.209 --> 01:12:20.003
- Hunting season's over. Let's go, start the car.
- Yes, sir.

01:12:20.170 --> 01:12:21.797
It went right through my femur.

01:12:21.964 --> 01:12:25.801
<i>Candidate Huggins shot his opponent,
Congressman Brady, in a hunting accident...</i>

01:12:25.968 --> 01:12:27.594

01:12:27.761 --> 01:12:29.388
<i>Ted Nugent would be proud.</i>

01:12:30.472 --> 01:12:32.808
- Bravo, young man.
- Well, well, well.

01:12:32.975 --> 01:12:34.643
If it isn't Dick Van Shrinkle.

01:12:36.019 --> 01:12:38.814
We didn't have any idea
that you had this kind of talent.

01:12:38.981 --> 01:12:40.023
Well done.

01:12:40.816 --> 01:12:45.571
I'm only saying this because I've had about
a dozen brandies and a bump of coke...

01:12:45.737 --> 01:12:47.906
...and I'm a little emotional.

01:12:48.073 --> 01:12:50.742
Goddamn it, I'm so proud of you. I mean...

01:12:52.536 --> 01:12:55.372
You actually shot a man
and went up in the polls.

01:12:55.539 --> 01:12:58.000
That's something we've only dreamed about.

01:12:58.166 --> 01:13:02.129
Well, I would've shot somebody a long time
ago if I knew you'd be proud of me, Dad.

01:13:02.296 --> 01:13:03.338
- Sit down.
- Okay.

01:13:03.505 --> 01:13:06.508
Well, the good news is
you don't have to worry about the charges.

01:13:06.675 --> 01:13:09.344
There was not a single soul
who was willing to testify.

01:13:09.511 --> 01:13:13.473
As of right now,
you are 12 points over Cam Brady.

01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:16.476
- That's right. MARTY: Well, I'm
just super overwhelmed by it.

01:13:16.643 --> 01:13:17.978
It's been a really good day.

01:13:18.145 --> 01:13:20.355
Well, I got some more good news
for you, son.

01:13:21.106 --> 01:13:26.653
We have purchased all the rights and
large tracts of land in your district...

01:13:26.820 --> 01:13:31.700
...and we will be building three factories
that will generate 8000 jobs...

01:13:31.867 --> 01:13:34.786
...and over a billion dollars of revenue
per annum.

01:13:34.953 --> 01:13:35.996
Oh, my goodness.

01:13:36.163 --> 01:13:38.540
And we immediately sold that real estate
and debt...

01:13:38.707 --> 01:13:41.376
...to the People's Republic
for a massive profit.

01:13:41.793 --> 01:13:45.547
- I'm sorry, to who?
- Oh. The 14th district now belongs to China.

01:13:50.510 --> 01:13:52.721
Guess those jobs will be good
for the district.

01:13:52.888 --> 01:13:55.265
Actually, American workers
are paid way too much...

01:13:55.432 --> 01:13:57.726
...for us to book the profits
we're accustomed to.

01:13:57.893 --> 01:14:01.772
We'll be bringing in low-paid Chinese labor.
They'll clock in at 50 cents an hour.

01:14:01.939 --> 01:14:04.316
We call the concept "insourcing."

01:14:04.483 --> 01:14:07.903
And we want you to start using "insourcing"
in all your campaign speeches.

01:14:08.070 --> 01:14:09.613
The word tested through the roof.

01:14:09.780 --> 01:14:13.283
It just kind of seems like you're building
a big sweatshop in Hammond.

01:14:13.450 --> 01:14:16.370
You have factories in China.
Why are you gonna bring them here?

01:14:16.536 --> 01:14:18.288
It'll save a fortune in shipping.

01:14:18.455 --> 01:14:21.917
It'll double the already-doubled profits
that we make.

01:14:22.751 --> 01:14:26.505
With all due respect, I thought we were
gonna do something nice for the district.

01:14:27.130 --> 01:14:31.468
And when you request those EPA waivers
and concessions on minimum wage...

01:14:31.635 --> 01:14:33.428
...the whole project will be a go.

01:14:37.641 --> 01:14:39.101
Well, Marty?

01:14:43.897 --> 01:14:45.190
No, I won't do it.

01:14:48.402 --> 01:14:52.406
I'm not gonna be known as the congressman
who sold out his district to the Chinese.

01:14:52.572 --> 01:14:54.741
What are you doing?
You're fucking up, baby bro.

01:14:54.908 --> 01:14:57.494
Goddamn it, son! Will you do as I say?

01:14:57.661 --> 01:15:00.497
Look, I'm not the type of guy
that talks back to his father.

01:15:00.664 --> 01:15:04.209
But I imagine that guy, and I imagine
that guy would say something like this:

01:15:05.043 --> 01:15:09.297
You were never there for me.
This town was always there for me.

01:15:09.923 --> 01:15:12.426
And by the way,
I know when you were married to Mama...

01:15:12.592 --> 01:15:16.471
...you were having an affair with that woman
that looked like Dog the Bounty Hunter.

01:15:18.140 --> 01:15:21.643
What you're doing is wrong.
It's dead wrong.

01:15:32.612 --> 01:15:33.655
Jiggle it.

01:15:33.822 --> 01:15:35.532
- Jiggle a little.
- Jiggle a little.

01:15:35.699 --> 01:15:37.325
I did. I mean...

01:15:37.492 --> 01:15:40.537
- Jig... You pull... Lift it up and jiggle it.
- Lift it up.

01:15:40.704 --> 01:15:42.289
- Shake and push.
- Now push.

01:15:42.456 --> 01:15:45.167
- No, at the same time. You gotta...
- Jiggle, shake and push.

01:15:45.333 --> 01:15:46.626
- Yeah.
- There it is.

01:15:46.793 --> 01:15:49.129
Nope. Now I got it.

01:15:54.676 --> 01:15:55.802
Do we kill him?

01:15:58.055 --> 01:15:59.097
No, no, no.

01:15:59.765 --> 01:16:03.143
What we're looking for is a new,
fresh voice...

01:16:03.310 --> 01:16:06.605
...that'll wake up the people
and harness their frustrations.

01:16:06.772 --> 01:16:08.231
A savior, if you will.

01:16:09.024 --> 01:16:12.694
And it turns out
he's been right in front of us all along.

01:16:13.987 --> 01:16:16.281
I'm not gonna cry.

01:16:16.448 --> 01:16:19.868
- I'm not gonna cry.
- Rinse.

01:16:20.577 --> 01:16:22.829
Jesus, Wattley.

01:16:23.288 --> 01:16:24.956
What the hell are you doing in here?

01:16:25.123 --> 01:16:29.878
Motch brothers sent me.
I'm here to make you not suck.

01:16:32.464 --> 01:16:37.719
Introducing the new and improved Cam Brady.

01:16:39.012 --> 01:16:40.430
Bring him down.

01:16:50.357 --> 01:16:52.442
How you doing, North Carolina?

01:16:53.110 --> 01:16:58.323
<i>The new Cam Brady is here today
to stop the talking and start the walking.</i>

01:16:58.490 --> 01:17:03.120
The funny thing is, there's still
a lot people out there that say no.

01:17:04.412 --> 01:17:06.665
Marty Huggins says no.

01:17:08.041 --> 01:17:12.754
But we're gonna kick his ass,
because that's how we do.

01:17:12.921 --> 01:17:14.297
Whoo!

01:17:16.133 --> 01:17:18.385
Motch paid me 50 grand
to make a few appearances.

01:17:18.552 --> 01:17:21.346
We're not back together.
Put your arm around me.

01:17:21.513 --> 01:17:24.516
Now, remember,
y'all have to support Cam Brady.

01:17:24.683 --> 01:17:26.726
Cam Brady '012. Whoo!

01:17:26.893 --> 01:17:30.021
Y'all have to hate Marty Huggins!

01:17:35.068 --> 01:17:37.279
Well, let's be honest.

01:17:38.864 --> 01:17:40.824
We're getting our tushes handed to us.

01:17:40.991 --> 01:17:44.161
You're only eight points down, Marty.

01:17:44.327 --> 01:17:48.540
There's a chance we could make it up
before the polls open tomorrow.

01:17:55.463 --> 01:17:58.300
- Hello, Mitzi.
- Hey, Marty.

01:17:59.551 --> 01:18:03.597
Look, after 17 years of
faithful marriage...

01:18:03.763 --> 01:18:06.224
...I did a bad, stupid thing.

01:18:06.391 --> 01:18:08.226
I got crazy, Marty.

01:18:08.393 --> 01:18:11.730
I lost myself and who I am.

01:18:11.897 --> 01:18:14.482
And I'll be sorry for the rest of my life.

01:18:15.108 --> 01:18:17.068
Well, you should be.

01:18:18.153 --> 01:18:19.988
You hurt my feelings, Mitzi.

01:18:20.614 --> 01:18:23.450
And I don't get my feelings hurt that much,
you know?

01:18:23.617 --> 01:18:25.952
But I'm to blame too.

01:18:26.119 --> 01:18:28.413
I turned my back on the boys and you.

01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:31.124
And to the people of this town.

01:18:31.750 --> 01:18:35.795
I got all messed up with the hoopla
of bigtime politics...

01:18:35.962 --> 01:18:38.465
...and look who I am now.

01:18:38.632 --> 01:18:40.425
I ain't much of nothing.

01:18:42.969 --> 01:18:46.973
Marty, tomorrow is election day.

01:18:47.140 --> 01:18:51.603
You're not gonna win.
And that means they'll destroy this town.

01:18:52.229 --> 01:18:54.773
You've got 14 hours
till they open up those polls.

01:18:54.940 --> 01:18:57.400
We're up against some dirty players.

01:18:57.567 --> 01:19:00.654
It's time to save this town.

01:19:06.952 --> 01:19:09.454
Now, when you say something like that...

01:19:09.621 --> 01:19:12.123
...I do get a little careless whisper
in my body.

01:19:12.290 --> 01:19:13.375
- Do you?
- Mm-hm.

01:19:22.050 --> 01:19:24.511
Be my Drew Carey.

01:19:24.678 --> 01:19:28.014
Mitzi Huggins, come on down.

01:19:37.232 --> 01:19:39.067
Oh. Oh, I'm dizzy.

01:19:39.234 --> 01:19:41.319
Okay, people.

01:19:41.486 --> 01:19:44.739
It's time to get to work. Let's do it.

01:19:46.616 --> 01:19:50.662
<i>It's election day.
Polls are opening on the East Coast.</i>

01:19:50.829 --> 01:19:53.832
<i>Record turnout
in North Carolina's 14th district..</i>

01:19:53.999 --> 01:19:57.294
<i>...where Cam Brady is solidly ahead.</i>

01:19:58.044 --> 01:19:59.629
- All right.
- That's how we do.

01:19:59.796 --> 01:20:01.548
Ha, ha. Hello.

01:20:01.715 --> 01:20:05.051
Stuart, do you still have those
TV commercial spots available for today?

01:20:05.218 --> 01:20:06.261
- Mm-hm.
- Okay.

01:20:06.428 --> 01:20:08.430
Hey. Hey, everybody.

01:20:08.596 --> 01:20:12.934
Hey, shut up, shut up, everybody.
Check out these TVs.

01:20:13.143 --> 01:20:17.147
<i>Hello, I'm Marty Huggins.
I'm running to be your congressman</i>

01:20:17.314 --> 01:20:21.318
<i>I've spent my last penny on this ad
to tell everyone in the district one thing.</i>

01:20:22.110 --> 01:20:23.695
<i>I have not been honest with you.</i>

01:20:23.862 --> 01:20:26.990
<i>See, the truth is,
big money is running politics in America.</i>

01:20:27.157 --> 01:20:30.702
<i>Billionaires and corporations
have given me millions of dollars...</i>

01:20:30.869 --> 01:20:32.495
<i>...to say what they want me to say.</i>

01:20:32.662 --> 01:20:33.955
What the hell is he doing?

01:20:34.122 --> 01:20:37.625
<i>And most of the time,
what they want me to say is a lie.</i>

01:20:37.792 --> 01:20:39.711
<i>Well, I'm not doing it any more.</i>

01:20:39.878 --> 01:20:43.465
<i>But on this election day,
if you choose to vote for me, know this:</i>

01:20:43.631 --> 01:20:47.635
<i>I will never take another dime
from any billionaire or corporation.</i>

01:20:47.802 --> 01:20:52.807
<i>And to get the ball rolling, I will tell
you the darkest secrets of my life.</i>

01:20:52.974 --> 01:20:57.729
<i>On October 23rd, 1996, at 2:11 p.m...</i>

01:20:57.896 --> 01:21:02.025
<i>...I farted in a very crowded elevator
and blamed it on a war veteran.</i>

01:21:02.192 --> 01:21:04.194
<i>I would like to apologize to that woman.</i>

01:21:04.611 --> 01:21:10.075
<i>Last year, I attended a Halloween party
dressed up as Lady Gaga.</i>

01:21:10.241 --> 01:21:14.829
<i>I felt so alive and free, I did not
take off the costume for two days.</i>

01:21:14.996 --> 01:21:16.664
<i>As a prank, when I was 15...</i>

01:21:16.831 --> 01:21:20.001
<i>...my big brother told me
you have to masturbate with your feet.</i>

01:21:20.168 --> 01:21:22.045
<i>And to this day, that's how I do it.</i>

01:21:24.255 --> 01:21:25.757
<i>This feels good. Ahem.</i>

01:21:25.924 --> 01:21:31.137
<i>Everyone, turn to the person next to you,
reach in your heart, and let it speak.</i>

01:21:32.055 --> 01:21:35.266
I had an affair with the waitress
at Ruby Tuesdays.

01:21:36.142 --> 01:21:37.894
So did I.

01:21:40.355 --> 01:21:43.858
I run a meth lab out of
the kids' tree fort.

01:21:44.025 --> 01:21:46.653
I'm your twin sister.

01:21:47.862 --> 01:21:52.450
Sometimes when I get a little drunk,
I let kids touch my old lady's titty.

01:21:52.617 --> 01:21:56.788
Ninety percent of the time, I have no
idea what the fuck I'm talking about.

01:21:57.330 --> 01:21:59.541
I tried to kill you in your sleep.

01:21:59.707 --> 01:22:01.084
What?

01:22:01.501 --> 01:22:03.628
Three times.

01:22:03.795 --> 01:22:08.633
<i>You see, telling the truth feels good,
and it's what this country was built on.</i>

01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:13.096
<i>I'm Marty Huggins,
and this is one message I approve.</i>

01:22:13.263 --> 01:22:18.226
Oh, Mr. Raymond.
Here you go, your afternoon refreshment.

01:22:18.393 --> 01:22:20.854
- Mrs. Yao?
- Yeah.

01:22:21.020 --> 01:22:23.565
Do you know what I like most
about your Asian boys?

01:22:23.731 --> 01:22:24.774
Hmm?

01:22:24.941 --> 01:22:27.610
They respect their elders
and do as they're told.

01:22:29.112 --> 01:22:31.114
You have been saying for years...

01:22:31.281 --> 01:22:33.450
...how you want Marty to stand up
and be his own man.

01:22:33.616 --> 01:22:37.495
Well, he's finally done it.
You should be proud of him.

01:22:37.662 --> 01:22:40.081
- What did you say?
- Oh, right. Uh...

01:22:40.582 --> 01:22:43.376
Your son Marty be standing up like a man...

01:22:43.543 --> 01:22:46.045
...but his pappy gots to support him.

01:22:48.339 --> 01:22:50.175
This is bullshit.

01:22:52.218 --> 01:22:53.470
<i>Election day winding down.</i>

01:22:53.636 --> 01:22:56.347
<i>North Carolina's 14th district
one of the last to call it.</i>

01:22:56.514 --> 01:22:59.893
<i>And today opponent Marty Huggins
did the craziest stunt to date.</i>

01:23:00.059 --> 01:23:04.230
<i>Marty Huggins, he actually promised to be
the most honest congressman out there.</i>

01:23:04.397 --> 01:23:07.150
<i>Listen, guys,
he opened his life up, and it's worked.</i>

01:23:07.317 --> 01:23:08.693
<i>He's up in the polls.</i>

01:23:08.860 --> 01:23:11.571
The whole country is still waiting
on the result.

01:23:11.779 --> 01:23:16.868
Ahem. We have a winner,
as verified by the State Election Board.

01:23:17.076 --> 01:23:19.162
And the results were as follows.

01:23:19.370 --> 01:23:24.501
With 90,362 votes, Camden Brady.

01:23:29.964 --> 01:23:33.134
And now for the results for Martin Huggins:

01:23:33.301 --> 01:23:37.597
80,365 votes. Cam Brady wins.

01:23:37.764 --> 01:23:40.225
- Yeah! Whoo!
- All right. Whoo!

01:23:44.395 --> 01:23:47.357
How can that be?
We were up 10,000 votes in the exit polls.

01:23:47.524 --> 01:23:49.484
<i>How can that be?</i>

01:23:56.241 --> 01:23:58.535
Who's taking care of business now?

01:23:58.701 --> 01:24:01.204
- Thank you.
- We did it, baby. We did it.

01:24:01.371 --> 01:24:04.749
It's you and me against the world forever.

01:24:05.792 --> 01:24:07.252
Cam Brady!

01:24:07.418 --> 01:24:10.505
- Thank you. Thank you so much.
- Well done.

01:24:11.923 --> 01:24:14.968
Pardon me. Excuse me, thank you.
Thank you.

01:24:15.134 --> 01:24:17.345
- Mitzi.
- Cam.

01:24:17.929 --> 01:24:18.972
Sorry.

01:24:19.639 --> 01:24:20.682
Hey, Marty.

01:24:21.307 --> 01:24:24.060
Why are you so upset?
You ran a hell of a campaign.

01:24:24.227 --> 01:24:27.730
- I mean, you got a real talent for this.
- You still don't get it, do you?

01:24:27.897 --> 01:24:30.817
I didn't do this for some career.

01:24:31.484 --> 01:24:34.696
I did this because I love my home
and I wanted to help out.

01:24:34.862 --> 01:24:38.992
Just like you did when you took down
that jaggedy jungle gym...

01:24:39.158 --> 01:24:42.036
...so other kids wouldn't get cut like me.

01:24:43.162 --> 01:24:44.789
- It got you too.
- Yeah.

01:24:44.956 --> 01:24:47.000
I remember that jaggedy jungle gym.

01:24:48.334 --> 01:24:50.128
- Ow.
- Look at this.

01:24:52.380 --> 01:24:53.548
Oh, no.

01:24:53.715 --> 01:24:57.719
Doctors said it was the worst
playground accident they'd ever seen.

01:25:00.722 --> 01:25:03.808
And I just dangled there
for two straight nights.

01:25:03.975 --> 01:25:05.393
Oh, good Lord.

01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:09.022
But back then, in the fourth grade,
I voted for you.

01:25:09.188 --> 01:25:10.231
You know why?

01:25:10.690 --> 01:25:14.861
Because you were a voice of the people.
But that's when we was kids.

01:25:15.361 --> 01:25:19.407
I guess this is the, uh...
The way of the world now.

01:25:20.617 --> 01:25:22.619
Come on, Cam, we gotta go.

01:25:25.288 --> 01:25:27.373
It had to be said.

01:25:27.540 --> 01:25:30.043
- Pull up your pants, honey.
- Okay.

01:25:30.793 --> 01:25:32.837
Here he is, the man of the hour.

01:25:33.379 --> 01:25:38.885
It's been a pleasure running his campaign.
Congressman Cam Brady.

01:25:39.052 --> 01:25:40.595
We love you, Cam.

01:25:40.762 --> 01:25:44.182
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you so much. Thanks.

01:25:45.224 --> 01:25:46.768
So, uh...

01:25:46.934 --> 01:25:49.312
So I won. That's great.

01:25:53.358 --> 01:25:56.944
Marty Huggins did a crazy thing
on TV today.

01:25:57.111 --> 01:25:59.113
He told the truth.

01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:01.282
So here I go.

01:26:01.449 --> 01:26:04.035
I am a great politician.

01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:08.873
Yeah.

01:26:29.352 --> 01:26:32.480
- But I am a horrible congressman.
- No.

01:26:32.647 --> 01:26:34.440
Now, hold on, hear me out.

01:26:34.607 --> 01:26:39.028
I hardly ever vote in Congress,
and I never read the bills.

01:26:39.237 --> 01:26:44.325
When I'm in D.C.,
I mostly Facebook old girlfriends...

01:26:44.492 --> 01:26:46.244
...play fantasy hockey.

01:26:46.828 --> 01:26:50.832
Words with Friends, Scrabble,
Draw Something.

01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:54.544
I just enjoy being Congressman Cam Brady...

01:26:54.711 --> 01:26:57.630
...and I was scared to
death of losing that.

01:26:58.172 --> 01:27:01.801
So I took a bunch of money
from the Motch brothers...

01:27:01.968 --> 01:27:07.223
...and convinced myself that selling
the 14th district to China was a good idea.

01:27:07.390 --> 01:27:09.392
All they care about is profits.

01:27:09.559 --> 01:27:12.478
Not you, not me, not America.

01:27:13.020 --> 01:27:16.232
The only reason why my wife is here tonight
is because they paid her to be here.

01:27:17.692 --> 01:27:20.236
Jesus, I think we should
take our leave. Excuse me.

01:27:20.403 --> 01:27:22.447
- He's a liar.
- He's a nutbag.

01:27:22.613 --> 01:27:24.407
Don't touch me. We're both ex-Marines.

01:27:24.574 --> 01:27:28.077
Get away now.
Get away or I'll start slapping people.

01:27:28.244 --> 01:27:31.998
But do you know which individual
in this room...

01:27:32.165 --> 01:27:34.751
...stood up to the Motch brothers
and said no?

01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:39.464
Marty Huggins.
That son of a bitch fears no man.

01:27:39.630 --> 01:27:41.883
He should be your congressman.

01:27:42.592 --> 01:27:44.927
Sure, I know what you're thinking:
He's a weirdo.

01:27:45.094 --> 01:27:47.180
I've often wondered...

01:27:47.346 --> 01:27:51.476
...why the folks
from Ripley's Believe It or Not!...

01:27:51.642 --> 01:27:54.771
...haven't broken into his house...

01:27:54.937 --> 01:27:57.315
...and kidnapped him
for a permanent display.

01:27:58.024 --> 01:28:02.528
But I'll tell you this: He's one of the good
ones, and I've actually grown fond of him.

01:28:02.695 --> 01:28:05.448
So with that, I'd like to announce
my withdrawal from this election...

01:28:07.033 --> 01:28:10.328
...and congratulate
Congressman Marty Huggins.

01:28:11.829 --> 01:28:14.081
Come on up here, Marty.

01:28:15.166 --> 01:28:16.626
Goddamn.

01:28:18.169 --> 01:28:22.882
AUDIENCE
<i>Marty! Marty! Marty! Marty! Marty!</i>

01:28:23.049 --> 01:28:24.675
You sure about this?

01:28:25.885 --> 01:28:27.929
Get on up there before I change my mind.

01:28:30.973 --> 01:28:32.600
Thanks so much.

01:28:33.059 --> 01:28:35.520
One minute you got your pants down...

01:28:35.686 --> 01:28:39.148
...and the next minute
you're a U.S. congressman.

01:28:40.441 --> 01:28:42.318
It's usually the other way around, I guess.

01:28:43.820 --> 01:28:47.990
I'd like to thank Cam Brady
for his intestinal fortitude...

01:28:48.157 --> 01:28:49.784
...for doing what he just did.

01:28:52.703 --> 01:28:57.834
I want the 14th district to know
that you will not be sold to China...

01:28:58.000 --> 01:28:59.460
...to Brazil...

01:29:00.002 --> 01:29:02.255
...to Nova Scotia...

01:29:02.421 --> 01:29:04.173
...or any other country.

01:29:04.340 --> 01:29:07.176
- Hi, Cam.
- Hey, Mitch.

01:29:07.343 --> 01:29:10.012
That was the greatest gesture
I've ever seen in my life.

01:29:10.179 --> 01:29:13.641
- That was book-worthy.
- Thank you.

01:29:13.808 --> 01:29:18.896
- I'd really like to work together again someday.
- Well, nothing would please me more.

01:29:19.272 --> 01:29:20.314
It's a deal.

01:29:20.481 --> 01:29:23.651
By the way, I hope you don't mind me
saying this, but you look great.

01:29:23.818 --> 01:29:25.486
- I started drinking again.
- Oh.

01:29:25.695 --> 01:29:27.530
Mm-hm.

01:29:27.697 --> 01:29:32.118
And I want to end daylight savings time.
I hate when it gets dark early.

01:29:33.536 --> 01:29:36.956
Washington, D.C., I have a message for you:

01:29:37.623 --> 01:29:41.377
I'm bringing my broom,
because you know why?

01:29:41.544 --> 01:29:43.254
It's a mess.

01:29:43.462 --> 01:29:48.050
<i>It's a mess! It's a mess! It's a mess!</i>

01:29:48.217 --> 01:29:50.928
<i>It's a mess! It's a mess!</i>

01:29:52.930 --> 01:29:55.933
<i>Congressman
Scott Talley will tender his resignation...</i>

01:29:56.100 --> 01:30:01.856
<i>...over allegations of using federal funds
to purchase his mistress's fake breasts.</i>

01:30:02.023 --> 01:30:07.445
<i>Large breasts offer more protection
to a woman's tender vital organs.</i>

01:30:08.279 --> 01:30:10.531
- Talley's done.
- What a waste.

01:30:12.074 --> 01:30:14.410
- Connie!
- I think you fired her.

01:30:14.577 --> 01:30:17.330
Oh, damn it. Who is it?

01:30:17.496 --> 01:30:20.917
Hola, it's me, Rosita,
your new cleaning lady.

01:30:21.083 --> 01:30:23.669
Oh, this is a big casa.

01:30:23.836 --> 01:30:27.965
It's going to take me forever to clean it,
but I do it for you.

01:30:29.842 --> 01:30:30.927
Go away.

01:30:31.093 --> 01:30:32.595
This is a subpoena...

01:30:32.762 --> 01:30:36.307
...for you to appear before a congressional
hearing on campaign-finance illegalities.

01:30:36.474 --> 01:30:38.684
You've been served, dickheads. Heh.

01:30:38.851 --> 01:30:40.811
- What?
- Who's heading this hearing?

01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:44.106
Oh. Congressman Marty Huggins...

01:30:44.273 --> 01:30:47.443
...and he's going to go loco
on your gringo asses.

01:30:50.780 --> 01:30:53.032
Greedy motherfuckers.

01:31:28.859 --> 01:31:31.946
Okay, everyone, please. Okay.

01:31:32.113 --> 01:31:34.824
I'd like to remind these gentlemen
why they are here.

01:31:34.991 --> 01:31:37.910
You were spending millions of dollars
buying politicians...

01:31:38.077 --> 01:31:40.204
...spreading misinformation...

01:31:40.371 --> 01:31:43.833
...and influencing legislation
for your personal gain.

01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:47.336
Now, I think the re...
Marty. You're doing great.

01:31:47.503 --> 01:31:50.464
- And I just love being your chief of staff.
- Good.

01:31:50.631 --> 01:31:53.968
Unfortunately,
none of these charges are illegal.

01:31:54.135 --> 01:31:55.594
Uh, that's correct, congressman.

01:31:55.761 --> 01:31:59.098
The Citizens United ruling
made that abundantly clear.

01:31:59.265 --> 01:32:04.228
Maybe I can't get you on the corruption
of elections, but I can get you on this:

01:32:06.522 --> 01:32:08.149
I can...

01:32:08.315 --> 01:32:11.652
It's a coupon to Chick-fil-A.
It's a coupon to Chick-fil-A.

01:32:12.862 --> 01:32:17.324
Aiding and abetting
a known international fugitive.

01:32:17.491 --> 01:32:21.787
This is Tim Wattley,
a.k.a. Leonidis Stavros...

01:32:21.954 --> 01:32:23.748
...a.k.a. the Greek Butcher...

01:32:23.914 --> 01:32:25.708
...a.k.a. the Greek Baker...

01:32:25.875 --> 01:32:28.002
...a.k.a. the Greek Candlestick Maker...

01:32:28.169 --> 01:32:30.212
...a.k.a. Dermot Mulroney...

01:32:30.838 --> 01:32:33.674
...a.k.a. Osama Getting-Laiden.

01:32:35.051 --> 01:32:37.970
Gentlemen, these are federal offenses.

01:32:38.137 --> 01:32:42.475
My brother is responsible for this.
I've never heard of Mr. Wattley in my life.

01:32:42.683 --> 01:32:44.185
Boom.

01:32:44.351 --> 01:32:46.729
- You're under arrest.
- I've never seen him before.

01:32:46.896 --> 01:32:50.024
- I'll tell you this: It's a mess.
- Whoo!

01:32:50.191 --> 01:32:52.193
I put you in that chair. I can get you out.

01:32:52.359 --> 01:32:53.903
- This is a sham.
- Are you kidding?

01:32:54.070 --> 01:32:56.906
- We make every decision together.
- This is all you.
