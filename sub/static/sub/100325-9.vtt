WEBVTT

00:02.437 --> 00:04.047
LEON: Previously
onAlmost Family...

00:04.091 --> 00:05.135
Did you even like me?

00:05.179 --> 00:06.441
Or were you just in it
for the drugs?

00:06.484 --> 00:08.051
I don't have a problem
with drugs.

00:08.095 --> 00:09.444
I have a problem with you!

00:09.487 --> 00:11.272
You've alienated
everyone else in your life.

00:11.315 --> 00:12.621
You always have.

00:12.664 --> 00:14.014
I just want to be there
for you.

00:14.057 --> 00:15.841
EDIE: I thought it was
just a one-time thing,

00:15.885 --> 00:17.669
but it is more than that.

00:17.713 --> 00:19.845
-Do you love her?
-Yes.

00:19.889 --> 00:21.543
Just go.

00:21.586 --> 00:23.371
-It's time for you to get help.
-I can't go in there.

00:23.414 --> 00:25.068
If I go in there, they're gonna
make me talk about everything,

00:25.112 --> 00:26.287
and I can't talk about it.

00:26.330 --> 00:28.419
You are the strongest person
I've ever met.

00:28.463 --> 00:29.638
EDIE: And we're gonna be
right here

00:29.681 --> 00:30.813
when you get out.

00:30.856 --> 00:32.336
Something else came up
in the results

00:32.380 --> 00:34.338
that is unexpected.

00:34.382 --> 00:36.297
Leon Bechley is not
your biological father.

01:18.600 --> 01:20.428
-Julia.

01:20.471 --> 01:22.169
-Julia.

01:22.212 --> 01:24.388
Julia.

01:24.432 --> 01:25.781
-Hey.

01:27.130 --> 01:28.262
-Are you okay?

01:28.305 --> 01:30.786
-Yeah.
-Just another nightmare?

01:30.829 --> 01:32.222
Yeah.

01:32.266 --> 01:34.572
That's weeks now.

01:34.616 --> 01:36.270
Maybe you need
to finally pull the trigger

01:36.313 --> 01:39.751
and talk to your dad,
you know, stop avoiding him.

01:39.795 --> 01:41.362
Or maybe I never pull
the trigger.

01:41.405 --> 01:44.452
Yeah,
that's a courageous choice.

01:44.495 --> 01:46.802
You know, when I was little,

01:46.845 --> 01:48.412
there was this man
who worked at the bodega

01:48.456 --> 01:49.413
next to my building.

01:49.457 --> 01:51.328
And I would go in there,

01:51.372 --> 01:53.287
and I would point
to his--his red hair,

01:53.330 --> 01:54.853
'cause he had hair
just like mine.

01:54.897 --> 01:56.594
And maybe he was
my biological father.

01:56.638 --> 01:57.856
The bodega man?

01:57.900 --> 01:59.815
Or my mom was
an early supporter

01:59.858 --> 02:02.905
of Bill Clinton,
and I've always leaned left.

02:02.948 --> 02:05.255
He's leaned towards anything
that's ever moved,

02:05.299 --> 02:06.778
and so maybe, I don't know,

02:06.822 --> 02:08.432
if she was in Arkansas
in the late '80s--

02:08.476 --> 02:09.520
Then former president
Bill Clinton

02:09.564 --> 02:10.608
could be your father.

02:10.652 --> 02:14.438
I'm just saying,
can't rule it out.

02:14.482 --> 02:17.441
Uh, as much as I enjoy
this fun little game of yours,

02:17.485 --> 02:20.792
I'm never gonna be able
to give you that answer.

02:20.836 --> 02:22.881
There's only one man
who can do that.

02:22.925 --> 02:26.450
Just think of talking to Leon

02:26.494 --> 02:29.888
as starting a new chapter.

02:29.932 --> 02:32.456
Speaking of...

02:32.500 --> 02:35.285
I've been thinking...

02:35.329 --> 02:37.461
I want to introduce you
to my kids.

02:37.505 --> 02:40.508
-Really?
-I mean, if you're ready.

02:40.551 --> 02:44.555
Yeah, I-I-I would love
to meet your kids.

02:44.599 --> 02:46.644
-I mean, I'm--I'm ready,

02:46.688 --> 02:48.472
if you're ready--
if they're ready,

02:48.516 --> 02:50.474
because that's--
'cause this is

02:50.518 --> 02:52.737
a big deal to me--to you--
to us.

02:52.781 --> 02:54.609
Are we ready?

02:54.652 --> 02:55.827
We're ready.

03:07.274 --> 03:10.538
-Morning.

03:10.581 --> 03:11.974
Enzo will be up soon.

03:13.932 --> 03:17.414
Okay, okay, I'm going.

03:17.458 --> 03:20.243
All right.
One more minute.

03:30.297 --> 03:33.778
By the way, 15 years is
as low as I'll go.

03:38.914 --> 03:40.437
All right, Bechley.

03:40.481 --> 03:42.265
How are negotiations going?

03:42.309 --> 03:43.701
Well, we haven't even started--

03:43.745 --> 03:45.486
Actually, we have a plea offer.

03:45.529 --> 03:47.749
-CHAD: And?
-15 years, down from 25.

03:47.792 --> 03:49.011
That's an offer?

03:49.054 --> 03:50.578
I'll present it to Leon.

03:50.621 --> 03:52.319
But he's not pleading guilty.

03:52.362 --> 03:54.451
We all know this is headed
to trial.

03:54.495 --> 03:55.931
Come on,
you're my power couple.

03:55.974 --> 03:57.628
I shouldn't have to remind
either of you.

03:57.672 --> 03:59.978
You don't make partner
taking lowball deals.

04:00.022 --> 04:01.763
We are aware of that,

04:01.806 --> 04:03.895
and we intend to do
a lot better.

04:03.939 --> 04:05.941
Yeah.

04:05.984 --> 04:08.465
What the hell?

04:08.509 --> 04:10.685
When did this offer roll in?
What was that, pillow talk?

04:10.728 --> 04:12.556
Because if you're trying
to just wrap this up

04:12.600 --> 04:14.428
so you can spend more time
with your girlfriend--

04:14.471 --> 04:16.038
I am obligated to present
any offer.

04:16.081 --> 04:18.649
I would never compromise Leon.

04:18.693 --> 04:21.870
I am working for the best
outcome for our client,

04:21.913 --> 04:23.567
and you know it.

04:23.611 --> 04:26.831
It's not just your career
hanging in the balance here.

04:26.875 --> 04:30.357
This affair that you're having,
it compromises my career, too.

04:30.400 --> 04:32.663
We could both get disbarred
because of this.

04:32.707 --> 04:34.317
That's not gonna happen.

04:34.361 --> 04:37.320
I would never let that happen.

04:38.800 --> 04:40.367
I'm sorry, okay?

04:40.410 --> 04:42.412
I should have told you.

04:42.456 --> 04:44.501
It's just hard keeping up
the act for Chad sometimes.

04:44.545 --> 04:46.677
Well, until this case is over,
that's how it's gonna be.

04:46.721 --> 04:48.940
That is the least you can do.

04:48.984 --> 04:50.377
And it shouldn't be a problem,

04:50.420 --> 04:51.769
because you are really good
at pretending.

04:55.382 --> 04:58.776
SINGER: ♪ Whoa,
ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ♪

04:58.820 --> 05:02.345
♪ Whoa,
ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh ♪

05:03.346 --> 05:05.827
EDIE: Have you talked to her?
How does she sound?

05:05.870 --> 05:06.915
She just texted,

05:06.958 --> 05:08.046
but she sounded good
in the text.

05:08.090 --> 05:09.700
So no matter what,

05:09.744 --> 05:12.137
if we just stay supportive
and positive,

05:12.181 --> 05:13.965
that's what'll get her
through this transition.

05:14.009 --> 05:16.446
One day at a time.
Progress, not perfection.

05:16.490 --> 05:18.361
I read all the links
you sent me.

05:18.405 --> 05:20.929
-Team Roxy.

05:29.503 --> 05:30.721
Julia?

05:32.854 --> 05:34.377
Edie?

05:35.944 --> 05:39.469
I got you.

05:39.513 --> 05:41.471
-Roxy.
-Don't do that.

05:41.515 --> 05:43.430
-EDIE: It's not funny.

05:43.473 --> 05:44.996
You should have seen
your faces.

05:45.040 --> 05:47.390
What'd you think, I was gonna
let them lobotomize me?

05:47.434 --> 05:49.740
Come on.
All right, so what's new?

05:49.784 --> 05:51.351
Spill the tea.
Who's gay now?

05:53.527 --> 05:55.006
What?

05:55.050 --> 05:57.618
Oh, Julia has some news.

06:00.621 --> 06:03.406
On the bright side, you didn't
sleep with your brother.

06:03.450 --> 06:05.930
Oh, trust me, that's the first
place that I went.

06:05.974 --> 06:07.497
You think I can get
the word out?

06:07.541 --> 06:08.759
I wouldn't stir the pot.

06:08.803 --> 06:11.414
The worst part is that
you guys aren't

06:11.458 --> 06:12.807
really my sisters anymore.

06:12.850 --> 06:14.678
Oh, come on, you're not getting
rid of me that easy.

06:14.722 --> 06:16.027
EDIE: That's what I keep
telling her.

06:16.071 --> 06:18.203
The sister ship has
officially sailed.

06:18.247 --> 06:20.423
Yeah, but, you know,
genetically...

06:20.467 --> 06:21.903
Screw genetics.

06:21.946 --> 06:22.947
You kind of saved my life.

06:22.991 --> 06:24.645
Yeah, and you kind of know

06:24.688 --> 06:26.124
way too much about me
to ever go back

06:26.168 --> 06:27.387
to being just friends.

06:28.692 --> 06:31.913
Hey, what?
Really, my cereal?

06:31.956 --> 06:33.958
Yeah.
Did you know that sugar

06:34.002 --> 06:35.569
lights up the same
dopamine receptors in the brain

06:35.612 --> 06:36.918
that drugs do?

06:36.961 --> 06:40.791
Well, did you know
you can have your room back?

06:40.835 --> 06:43.054
-Oh.
-I'm happy on the couch.

06:43.098 --> 06:44.882
-You called it my room.
-Yeah.

06:44.926 --> 06:46.188
Of course it's your room.

06:46.231 --> 06:50.453
I mean, it's my apartment,
but it is your room.

06:50.497 --> 06:53.064
-I'm so glad you're back.
-Me too.

06:53.108 --> 06:54.457
And don't worry
about Leon, okay?

06:54.501 --> 06:56.938
Just talk to him.
You're still the OG.

06:56.981 --> 06:59.636
I'm just afraid
when I say it out loud to him,

06:59.680 --> 07:01.725
it'll, you know, make it real.

07:01.769 --> 07:03.510
Well, it is real.

07:03.553 --> 07:06.121
Take it from me, you can
only avoid reality so long.

07:12.562 --> 07:13.824
Dad?

07:13.868 --> 07:16.827
Julia!
In here.

07:16.871 --> 07:18.873
Oh, what a surprise
and a nice one.

07:18.916 --> 07:20.091
Been a while.

07:20.135 --> 07:23.181
Yeah, sorry.
I've been busy.

07:23.225 --> 07:28.099
Oh--no, no, it's--yeah,
I'm glad you're here.

07:28.143 --> 07:30.101
Are you hungry?
'Cause I can make more.

07:30.145 --> 07:32.147
No, I'm okay.
Thanks.

07:32.190 --> 07:34.236
Um, the hydrangeas came.

07:34.279 --> 07:36.499
So we're good
for Friday, yeah?

07:36.543 --> 07:39.502
Yeah, yeah, we are.
Thanks for doing that.

07:39.546 --> 07:41.852
Sure.

07:41.896 --> 07:45.203
I mean, do you want to do
something else instead?

07:45.247 --> 07:49.120
Oh, no, that'll be great.

07:49.164 --> 07:51.775
All right.
So what's going on?

07:51.819 --> 07:55.953
Um, I have a patient file
I need you to look at.

07:55.997 --> 07:57.825
Okay, who's the patient?

07:57.868 --> 07:59.217
I am.

08:01.524 --> 08:03.787
Okay, uh...

08:03.831 --> 08:07.704
Uh, is this related
to the fertility workup?

08:07.748 --> 08:11.142
Um, no--yes.

08:11.186 --> 08:13.318
I'm actually not infertile.
I'm fine.

08:13.362 --> 08:15.843
Just read it.

08:30.640 --> 08:32.555
Yeah, um...

08:32.599 --> 08:34.209
This means that--

08:34.252 --> 08:36.690
Yes, I-I-I know
what it means.

08:38.779 --> 08:41.259
You're not surprised?

08:41.303 --> 08:42.696
No.

08:44.959 --> 08:47.178
Um...

08:47.222 --> 08:48.832
well, I--
how did you--when--

08:48.876 --> 08:50.051
have you known?

08:51.879 --> 08:53.707
Always?

08:53.750 --> 08:55.273
Yes.

08:56.753 --> 08:59.669
I-I hoped this day
would never come.

08:59.713 --> 09:01.366
Um...

09:01.410 --> 09:05.588
So all--my whole life,
my--all of the memories

09:05.632 --> 09:07.982
that I have with you,
you've known.

09:08.025 --> 09:11.072
This is another secret.
This is another lie.

09:11.115 --> 09:12.377
What about the story
you told me

09:12.421 --> 09:13.988
about when I was born?

09:14.031 --> 09:15.946
When Mom was in the hospital
and you took care of me.

09:15.990 --> 09:18.862
Did that happen?
Is that--is that true?

09:18.906 --> 09:21.169
Of course it is.
This doesn't change that.

09:21.212 --> 09:22.823
Well, then what happened?
How is that possible?

09:22.866 --> 09:24.694
-That's irrelevant.
-What?

09:24.738 --> 09:26.130
Look, your mother was
your mother,

09:26.174 --> 09:27.305
and I'm your father.

09:27.349 --> 09:28.698
Nothing else matters.

09:28.742 --> 09:30.831
No, knowing my story matters.

09:30.874 --> 09:33.007
Knowing who I am matters.
It matters to me.

09:33.050 --> 09:34.661
It matters to everyone.

09:34.704 --> 09:36.706
I've gotten the chance
to learn that, thanks to you.

09:36.750 --> 09:38.839
People need to know
who they came from.

09:38.882 --> 09:40.318
They need to know
where they came from.

09:40.362 --> 09:42.625
That is not for me to tell,
and you and I are better off

09:42.669 --> 09:45.149
if we just--we leave it
at that.

09:45.193 --> 09:46.716
What if that's not good enough
for me?

09:46.760 --> 09:48.718
No, Julia, I don't want to have
this conversation.

09:55.769 --> 09:57.509
Does he really think
that we can just go on

09:57.553 --> 09:59.294
with this elephant in the room
that we never discuss?

09:59.337 --> 10:00.687
I mean, how is that supposed
to work?

10:00.730 --> 10:02.471
-Denial's a powerful thing.

10:02.514 --> 10:05.343
-So is arrogance.
-ROXY: Cosign.

10:05.387 --> 10:09.521
I look at that picture now,
and I...I think...

10:09.565 --> 10:11.262
I don't even know
what to think.

10:11.306 --> 10:14.091
I mean, if I'm not the daughter
of Leon Bechley,

10:14.135 --> 10:16.267
then who am I?

10:16.311 --> 10:17.704
Or maybe he's right.

10:17.747 --> 10:20.663
Maybe I don't even want to know
the answer to that.

10:20.707 --> 10:23.405
You know what's even scarier?

10:23.448 --> 10:25.233
Knowing who you can't be
anymore.

10:25.276 --> 10:26.800
Hey.

10:26.843 --> 10:29.106
You're still our Roxy,

10:29.150 --> 10:31.631
and we're not going
anywhere, okay?

10:31.674 --> 10:34.677
Speaking of which, you're going
to work with Edie today.

10:34.721 --> 10:36.331
Ugh. Why?

10:36.374 --> 10:37.724
I thought I had her
Tuesdays and Thursdays.

10:37.767 --> 10:39.595
-You--you do, but remember...
-Hello?

10:39.639 --> 10:40.901
I told you I was gonna go see
Donovan's kids.

10:40.944 --> 10:42.424
But I can cancel.
It's not a big deal.

10:43.512 --> 10:43.599
-EDIE: Well, yeah, no...
-JULIA: I just need to know...

10:44.382 --> 10:44.774
ROXY:
She is right here.

10:45.383 --> 10:47.124
Okay?
I am she.

10:47.168 --> 10:49.170
-I can stay home alone.
-Are you sure?

10:49.213 --> 10:51.868
Look, I get that you guys are
12-stepping up or whatever,

10:51.912 --> 10:53.304
but I'm okay.

10:53.348 --> 10:55.176
I actually have things to do.

10:55.219 --> 10:57.439
I have amends to make,
a lot of them.

10:57.482 --> 10:59.571
So go, I got it.

10:59.615 --> 11:01.399
-Okay.
-Okay.

11:01.443 --> 11:02.705
Call us if you need anything.

11:02.749 --> 11:03.663
-Okay.

11:03.706 --> 11:04.881
I really will cancel.

11:04.925 --> 11:06.709
It's fine, just go.
It's all right.

11:06.753 --> 11:07.841
It's important.

11:16.197 --> 11:18.286
You always knew
there was a chance

11:18.329 --> 11:19.548
Julia would learn the truth.

11:19.591 --> 11:21.245
Mm.
I suppose.

11:21.289 --> 11:23.770
I just--I thought
he'd come looking for her,

11:23.813 --> 11:26.337
and that's--that's how
she'd find out.

11:26.381 --> 11:28.775
I never entertained the notion
that it would be my work--

11:28.818 --> 11:32.169
that the science would be
the reason.

11:32.213 --> 11:35.782
Okay, so now she knows.

11:35.825 --> 11:39.437
Maybe it's a good thing
for both of you.

11:39.481 --> 11:42.745
I'm so tired of secrets.

11:42.789 --> 11:45.313
I mean, aren't you tired?

11:45.356 --> 11:47.358
I don't want to lose her.

11:47.402 --> 11:49.883
Look, you have
to trust her, Leon.

11:49.926 --> 11:51.754
I mean, we can't be afraid

11:51.798 --> 11:54.452
of our children
knowing the truth.

11:54.496 --> 11:57.717
-Have a little faith.
-Mm.

11:57.760 --> 12:00.328
EDIE:
Sorry, it's a no-go.

12:00.371 --> 12:02.286
My boss laughed me
out of the conference room.

12:02.330 --> 12:03.592
Did he?

12:03.635 --> 12:05.246
We both knew
that was gonna happen.

12:05.289 --> 12:07.683
I'm just trying to get this
case off my books, counselor,

12:07.727 --> 12:09.206
off our books.

12:10.468 --> 12:11.992
Well, as enticing
as that sounds,

12:12.035 --> 12:15.517
you're gonna have to do better,
a lot better.

12:15.560 --> 12:19.477
Come on, sweeten the pot.

12:19.521 --> 12:21.697
I told you...

12:21.741 --> 12:23.830
that's as sweet
as it's gonna get.

12:23.873 --> 12:26.746
I don't care what Chad thinks.
Take it to your client.

12:26.789 --> 12:29.487
-Hmm?

12:29.531 --> 12:31.838
-Am I boring you?
-No, sorry.

12:31.881 --> 12:33.709
I've just been sleeping
on Julia's couch,

12:33.753 --> 12:35.319
if you can call that sleep.

12:37.408 --> 12:40.368
Your bed's
a lot more comfortable.

12:42.979 --> 12:44.720
Yeah, it is.

12:44.764 --> 12:47.897
In fact, I was thinking...

12:49.986 --> 12:52.380
What if I staystay over,

12:52.423 --> 12:54.556
instead of sneaking out
at the crack of dawn

12:54.599 --> 12:55.513
all the time?

12:57.428 --> 12:58.690
Oh.

12:58.734 --> 13:00.780
I mean, if it's okay
with you and Enzo.

13:02.956 --> 13:04.784
That could maybe work.

13:06.611 --> 13:09.440
Just a couple nights a week?

13:09.484 --> 13:11.878
We'll see how it goes.

13:11.921 --> 13:14.358
Yeah?

13:14.402 --> 13:15.577
Okay.

13:28.633 --> 13:30.287
Hey, stranger.

13:30.331 --> 13:32.463
Hey.

13:34.422 --> 13:36.816
So I'm out of rehab.

13:36.859 --> 13:38.556
Good for you.

13:38.600 --> 13:41.908
I'm, uh--I'm making
the apology tour.

13:44.824 --> 13:47.304
Obviously, yours is a biggie.

13:47.348 --> 13:48.915
Yeah.

13:50.394 --> 13:51.787
I missed you.

13:54.398 --> 13:55.878
Thing is,
I'm not really supposed to do

13:55.922 --> 13:57.445
the relationship thing
right now,

13:57.488 --> 13:59.664
um, I mean, with other people.

13:59.708 --> 14:01.884
Kind of have to focus
on myself.

14:01.928 --> 14:04.713
Um, so I can't really hang out.

14:06.454 --> 14:08.021
Yeah, me too.

14:12.112 --> 14:15.506
Isaac, I never should have
used your prescription pad--

14:15.550 --> 14:18.596
Stolen it.
Stolen it, you mean.

14:18.640 --> 14:20.729
Stolen it, right.

14:22.078 --> 14:25.081
I wasn't thinking straight,
and I'm sorry.

14:25.125 --> 14:27.518
You knew exactly
what you were doing.

14:27.562 --> 14:29.651
You just weren't thinking
about how it would affect me,

14:29.694 --> 14:31.392
how it might actually trigger
the medical board

14:31.435 --> 14:34.482
to look into my license
and whether I can keep it.

14:34.525 --> 14:36.832
I'm glad
you're doing well, Roxy.

14:36.876 --> 14:39.922
I-I really am, but...

14:39.966 --> 14:41.532
I can't do this.

14:43.665 --> 14:47.974
Um, I have patients
to see, so...

14:49.410 --> 14:50.628
Okay.

15:02.727 --> 15:04.512
-Hi.
-Hey, you look great.

15:04.555 --> 15:05.817
Thanks.

15:05.861 --> 15:07.167
-This is exciting.
-I'm excited.

15:07.210 --> 15:08.646
I'm nervous.

15:08.690 --> 15:09.691
I'm super nerv--
I know I shouldn't be, but--

15:09.734 --> 15:10.866
-No.

15:10.910 --> 15:11.998
-Ooh, sorry--oh.

15:12.041 --> 15:13.695
-It's--you're good.
-I'm good.

15:13.738 --> 15:16.176
-Hi.
-Oh, hi.

15:16.219 --> 15:18.700
-Uh, you must be Luke.
-Yeah, this is my big guy.

15:18.743 --> 15:21.137
I'm Julia.
Cool shirt.

15:21.181 --> 15:22.660
Your dad tells me
you're a soccer player.

15:22.704 --> 15:23.748
Oh, yeah.

15:23.792 --> 15:25.489
Oh, and he had
an amazing game--

15:25.533 --> 15:27.404
Dad, let me tell her.

15:27.448 --> 15:29.624
We played Emerson, who's, like,
one of the toughest teams.

15:29.667 --> 15:31.582
They have these two forwards
who literally look like

15:31.626 --> 15:33.149
they're in high school,
and their goalie has,

15:33.193 --> 15:34.846
like, 50 saves or something.

15:34.890 --> 15:36.805
Uh, but I scored two goals.

15:36.848 --> 15:38.198
And...

15:38.241 --> 15:39.460
And I saved one.

15:39.503 --> 15:41.157
Nice.
Amazing.

15:41.201 --> 15:42.767
Congrats.

15:42.811 --> 15:44.682
-Olivia!
-OLIVIA: What?

15:44.726 --> 15:45.945
Come here, please.

15:45.988 --> 15:47.729
OLIVIA: Coming.

15:47.772 --> 15:51.472
FYI, less is more with Olivia--
you know, teen-girl alert.

15:51.515 --> 15:53.996
Used to be one, I got this.
I'm not scared of her.

15:54.040 --> 15:56.042
-I am.

15:56.085 --> 15:59.567
And there she is.
Olivia, this is Julia.

15:59.610 --> 16:01.961
Nice to meet you.

16:02.004 --> 16:05.181
You too.
Canned water, cool.

16:05.225 --> 16:06.922
That was Olivia's idea.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.750
She got us off
of plastic bottles.

16:08.793 --> 16:10.491
Nice.
I hear you're all about

16:10.534 --> 16:11.971
taking care of the planet.

16:12.014 --> 16:14.190
Unlike your generation.

16:14.234 --> 16:15.975
Yeah, we're the worst.

16:16.018 --> 16:17.759
I think it's great
that you found something

16:17.802 --> 16:19.500
to be passionate about.

16:19.543 --> 16:21.806
I mean, when I was your age,
I think I was only passionate

16:21.850 --> 16:23.808
about the cast of The O.C.

16:26.507 --> 16:28.465
Is dinner almost ready?

16:28.509 --> 16:30.206
Yeah, uh, let me go check
on the salmon.

16:30.250 --> 16:31.773
-We can, uh...
-Oh, sure, thanks.

16:31.816 --> 16:32.861
Get this show on the road.

16:32.904 --> 16:34.167
Great.

16:36.821 --> 16:40.086
Dead cow, dead crocodile,
dead cow.

16:40.129 --> 16:42.131
Oh.

16:43.480 --> 16:44.699
Um, no, no.

16:44.742 --> 16:46.048
This is, um--this is
faux crocodile,

16:46.092 --> 16:47.049
'cause I can't afford--

16:47.093 --> 16:48.659
Great, plastic.

16:48.703 --> 16:51.184
That's even better
for the planet.

16:51.227 --> 16:53.882
I'm confused.
Is it better?

16:53.925 --> 16:58.278
Do yourself a favor, Julia.
Don't try so hard.

16:58.321 --> 17:00.149
There's really no point.

17:01.759 --> 17:03.805
Need any help, Dad?

17:06.764 --> 17:09.506
JULIA:
Um...

17:09.550 --> 17:11.813
Okay.
I'll--I'll just hang out here.

17:16.731 --> 17:19.038
Who knew you were so handy
in the kitchen?

17:20.343 --> 17:22.215
Hi, Mom!

17:22.258 --> 17:24.086
Hi, baby.

17:24.130 --> 17:25.696
Missed you.
You're early.

17:25.740 --> 17:28.090
Better than being late.

17:28.134 --> 17:30.223
We'll see you in a couple days.

17:30.266 --> 17:32.051
Bye, Mom.

17:32.094 --> 17:33.791
Hey, Edie,
come play Fortnite.

17:33.835 --> 17:35.663
EDIE: Yes, yes,
I would love to.

17:35.706 --> 17:37.099
I'll be right there.

17:37.143 --> 17:40.885
Margaret, this is
my girlfriend, Edie.

17:40.929 --> 17:42.974
Hi, really nice to meet you.

17:43.018 --> 17:44.715
You too.

17:44.759 --> 17:46.804
Glad to see you and Enzo
have hit it off so well.

17:46.848 --> 17:48.676
Yeah, he's a really great kid.

17:52.332 --> 17:53.724
So...

17:54.769 --> 17:57.250
Um, I am gonna go--

17:57.293 --> 17:59.339
I'm gonna go
play Fortnitewith him.

18:03.778 --> 18:05.997
Enzo says she's been here
a lot lately.

18:06.041 --> 18:07.782
-Did he?
-He did.

18:07.825 --> 18:10.872
Well, Enzo feels comfortable
with her, and, actually,

18:10.915 --> 18:14.136
I wanted to talk to you
about this.

18:14.180 --> 18:16.965
Up until now, Edie's just been
Mommy's friend,

18:17.008 --> 18:20.751
but we're gonna take
the next step.

18:20.795 --> 18:22.840
She's gonna stay over
a couple nights a week.

18:22.884 --> 18:24.103
Really?

18:24.146 --> 18:26.366
What?

18:26.409 --> 18:28.194
I'm fine with it
if you are.

18:28.237 --> 18:31.153
It's just fast.

18:31.197 --> 18:33.764
This is the woman who's still
married to a man, right?

18:33.808 --> 18:36.245
You're her first lesbian.
You're letting her U-Haul you?

18:36.289 --> 18:38.073
She's not U-Hauling me.

18:38.117 --> 18:42.077
We're--this isn't casual
between us.

18:42.121 --> 18:45.298
I love you.
I trust you.

18:45.341 --> 18:47.778
But it seems like she should do
a little exploring first

18:47.822 --> 18:49.780
before she settles down.

18:49.824 --> 18:52.783
I don't want to see you
get hurt or Enzo.

18:58.311 --> 19:01.227
-So how'd it go with Isaac?
-Not great.

19:01.270 --> 19:04.273
No, Isaac is really mad at me,
and I am really sober.

19:04.317 --> 19:06.232
So I get to feel
all of that anger.

19:06.275 --> 19:08.886
And you know what? I don't--
I don't really like it.

19:08.930 --> 19:11.802
-You're walking the walk.
-Proud of you.

19:11.846 --> 19:12.803
BOTH:
We're here for you, if you--

19:12.847 --> 19:14.109
I know.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.719
I know you are here for me.

19:15.763 --> 19:17.199
You are literally
right in front of me.

19:17.243 --> 19:18.679
Thank you.

19:21.203 --> 19:24.859
So we losing a roomie?

19:24.902 --> 19:26.904
Me?
You're not losing me.

19:26.948 --> 19:28.210
You are not losing me.

19:28.254 --> 19:31.996
It's just a couple nights
a week...for now.

19:32.040 --> 19:33.911
-It's going well.

19:33.955 --> 19:36.000
I met Amanda's ex,
cleared that hurdle.

19:36.044 --> 19:38.046
You know what I didn't
anticipate is

19:38.089 --> 19:40.309
-how much I would love Enzo.
-Hmm.

19:40.353 --> 19:41.876
That little guy's
got me hooked.

19:41.919 --> 19:43.356
Must be nice.

19:43.399 --> 19:45.053
I'm not even shooting for love.

19:45.096 --> 19:47.229
I just want Donovan's kids
not to hate me.

19:47.273 --> 19:48.883
Oh, it takes time.
You got to find common ground.

19:48.926 --> 19:50.232
Like what they like.

19:50.276 --> 19:52.016
Yeah, you know they can
smell fear, right?

19:55.281 --> 19:57.196
My dad was really upset
when I told him

19:57.239 --> 19:58.371
he wasn't a genetic match.

19:58.414 --> 20:00.111
We cried together,

20:00.155 --> 20:03.202
which is the first time
that's ever happened.

20:03.245 --> 20:06.248
Wow.
That--that's powerful.

20:06.292 --> 20:08.424
Thank you for sharing that
with the group.

20:08.468 --> 20:10.209
So what if he doesn't cry?

20:10.252 --> 20:14.865
What if he doesn't even want
to talk to you about it at all?

20:14.909 --> 20:18.739
Has that happened
to anyone here?

20:18.782 --> 20:21.045
Really?
Not at all?

20:21.089 --> 20:24.875
Okay, um--well, have any of you
considered meeting

20:24.919 --> 20:26.137
your biological father?

20:28.488 --> 20:31.360
Miriam, are you worried that
will change your relationship

20:31.404 --> 20:32.883
with the man who raised you?

20:32.927 --> 20:35.190
Not really.
I think he'll understand.

20:35.234 --> 20:36.278
What if he doesn't?

20:36.322 --> 20:38.149
Um...

20:38.193 --> 20:39.847
I have too much respect
for my old man

20:39.890 --> 20:41.544
to try and find my bio dad.

20:41.588 --> 20:43.111
But don't you want to know
where you came from?

20:43.154 --> 20:44.765
Don't you want to know more?

20:44.808 --> 20:46.897
-Weren't you just saying--
-I think what I'm saying is,

20:46.941 --> 20:49.335
sometimes it's hard for us
to know what to do.

20:49.378 --> 20:51.467
I mean, sometimes,
I don't know,

20:51.511 --> 20:53.948
you're--you're afraid
of--of finding out things

20:53.991 --> 20:55.515
you don't know about.

20:55.558 --> 20:57.473
Or maybe you're afraid
of looking inward

20:57.517 --> 20:59.258
or of hurting the people
that you love

20:59.301 --> 21:02.173
or facing rejection
or all of those things.

21:02.217 --> 21:05.002
And, you know, you're going
throughout your day,

21:05.046 --> 21:07.004
and you're trying to--trying to
act like nothing's different.

21:07.048 --> 21:08.397
Nothing's changed.
You see your clients.

21:08.441 --> 21:10.138
You go out with your boyfriend.

21:10.181 --> 21:12.053
But in the back of your mind,
your brain is just churning.

21:12.096 --> 21:14.142
Like, "Your father is
not your father,"

21:14.185 --> 21:16.144
and "Your sisters are not
your sisters."

21:16.187 --> 21:18.059
And you don't really have
any family,

21:18.102 --> 21:19.930
and then it's like this tsunami
that just kind of--just--

21:19.974 --> 21:21.932
just swallows you up
and then spits you back out

21:21.976 --> 21:23.456
into the--into the sand.

21:23.499 --> 21:25.806
And then there's just broken,

21:25.849 --> 21:28.330
scattered body parts just--
just all around the beach,

21:28.374 --> 21:30.289
and you're just trying to pick
them back up

21:30.332 --> 21:32.073
and put 'em in the cart.

21:32.116 --> 21:35.381
But you just don't know
how you got the cart.

21:39.863 --> 21:41.387
I'm sorry.

21:41.430 --> 21:45.086
I think the first step is for
me to put myself out there--

21:45.129 --> 21:49.612
for you all to put yourself
out there...

21:49.656 --> 21:51.092
I mean.

21:54.138 --> 21:55.444
Did you have a chance to look

21:55.488 --> 21:57.490
at the draft motions
in limine for Bechley?

21:57.533 --> 21:59.230
Oh, not yet.

21:59.274 --> 22:01.363
Um, I'm sorry.

22:01.407 --> 22:04.235
Um, I have a call, but I can
get back to you in 20 or so.

22:10.590 --> 22:12.200
Who's Enzo?

22:14.507 --> 22:16.335
Amanda's son.

22:18.119 --> 22:19.076
Right.

22:19.120 --> 22:20.643
Tim.

22:20.687 --> 22:23.298
Just call me when you've had
a chance to look it over.

22:40.141 --> 22:41.577
Roxy?

22:43.057 --> 22:44.972
Natalie, hey.

22:45.015 --> 22:48.323
Um...is Izzy here?
I just wanted to, um--

22:48.367 --> 22:50.325
She's at school.

22:50.369 --> 22:51.500
Oh, right.
Of course.

22:51.544 --> 22:55.461
Um...you know,
it's--it's been a while.

22:55.504 --> 22:59.203
I just wanted to come by
now that I'm out of...

22:59.247 --> 23:01.423
Um, I just wanted to see
how she's doing.

23:01.467 --> 23:04.426
She's doing great.

23:04.470 --> 23:06.036
Great.
Good.

23:06.080 --> 23:08.256
Kept up her training
at Round-Offs.

23:08.299 --> 23:11.085
-Oh.
-Nick took over.

23:11.128 --> 23:12.478
She's excelling.

23:12.521 --> 23:14.088
He thinks maybe four years,

23:14.131 --> 23:16.351
she'll be trial ready,
not eight.

23:16.395 --> 23:18.397
Yeah, he may be right
about that.

23:18.440 --> 23:20.399
Um, listen...

23:23.706 --> 23:26.405
I know it's all
very exciting...

23:26.448 --> 23:30.974
um, but Nick
is manipulative.

23:31.018 --> 23:32.976
You just--
you need to be careful.

23:33.020 --> 23:34.630
You know, he told me
you might come around,

23:34.674 --> 23:36.545
say negative things about him.

23:36.589 --> 23:39.200
Look, I don't know
what he told you, but, um...

23:41.376 --> 23:43.334
You can't trust him, okay?

23:43.378 --> 23:47.469
He--he grooms people,
and he's dangerous.

23:47.513 --> 23:50.429
And--and when I was
a teenager,

23:50.472 --> 23:51.734
he took advantage of me.

23:51.778 --> 23:53.432
And I thought it was
a relationship,

23:53.475 --> 23:54.781
but I know that now--

23:54.824 --> 23:56.739
How am I supposed to believe
anything that you say?

23:56.783 --> 23:58.262
You let my daughter ride around
in your Porsche

23:58.306 --> 24:00.134
while you were high as a kite.

24:00.177 --> 24:02.745
-I mean, she could have--
-I know, I know.

24:02.789 --> 24:04.138
You came to my door,

24:04.181 --> 24:06.445
and you lied
straight to my face.

24:11.145 --> 24:12.451
I know.

24:12.494 --> 24:14.104
I know I've made
terrible mistakes,

24:14.148 --> 24:15.628
but I'm here,

24:15.671 --> 24:19.153
and I am taking responsibility
for that, and I am sorry.

24:19.196 --> 24:20.546
But you have to believe me--

24:20.589 --> 24:24.201
No, no, no, no, no.
No buts, no.

24:24.245 --> 24:26.508
We're done Roxy.

24:26.552 --> 24:29.076
I-I can't trust you.

24:29.119 --> 24:31.295
I can't ever trust you again.

24:47.660 --> 24:49.096
-Ooh.
-Oh!

24:49.139 --> 24:51.185
-JULIA: No. Aw!

24:51.228 --> 24:52.752
-Dude, give me a chance.
-Well, you can't just

24:52.795 --> 24:53.927
stand there with it.

24:53.970 --> 24:55.537
-You got to pass.
-How do I do that again?

24:55.581 --> 24:57.583
-BOTH: Hit X.
-Okay.

24:57.626 --> 24:59.193
Sorry.
I thought that's how you shoot.

24:59.236 --> 25:00.847
Olivia, you're next.

25:00.890 --> 25:02.588
Uh, no, I'm not.

25:02.631 --> 25:04.633
Hey, we're all here having fun.

25:04.677 --> 25:06.722
It's okay. Olivia can cheer
me on from the couch.

25:06.766 --> 25:08.768
Yeah, go Julia.

25:10.770 --> 25:12.293
-Goal!
-Oh.

25:12.336 --> 25:14.295
Wait, that's it?

25:14.338 --> 25:16.645
You were down 25-0.
It's automatic mercy rule.

25:16.689 --> 25:18.952
That's not fair.
How do I get my fans to riot?

25:20.867 --> 25:22.738
Oh, I forgot.
I got you guys something.

25:22.782 --> 25:24.958
Um, it's nothing huge.

25:25.001 --> 25:28.309
But, uh, I was walking
in the Village the other day,

25:28.352 --> 25:32.966
and, Olivia,
this is 100% hemp

25:33.009 --> 25:34.576
and 100% exchangeable.

25:34.620 --> 25:36.230
Oh, that's cool.

25:36.273 --> 25:37.927
Olivia, isn't that awesome?

25:37.971 --> 25:40.626
Yeah, thanks.

25:40.669 --> 25:43.542
Um, and then, Luke,
I saw this vintage store,

25:43.585 --> 25:47.110
and I remembered
that you liked The Pretenders.

25:47.154 --> 25:48.677
-Oh.
-And so I got you another one,

25:48.721 --> 25:49.896
a new one,
'cause the other one

25:49.939 --> 25:50.940
seemed like you had it
for a while.

25:50.984 --> 25:52.638
So...and I love any kid

25:52.681 --> 25:54.640
who digs Chrissie Hynde,
'cause that's cool.

25:54.683 --> 25:56.555
-Julia...
-What?

25:56.598 --> 25:57.556
I don't want a new one.

26:00.123 --> 26:01.690
That was Mom's shirt.

26:01.734 --> 26:04.040
She loved The Pretenders.

26:04.084 --> 26:05.259
Oh.

26:05.302 --> 26:06.956
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.176
No, it's okay.
Uh, just--I'll be right back.

26:09.219 --> 26:10.351
Oh, yeah.
Sure, sure.

Roxy.

26:59.748 --> 27:02.185
It's good to see you.

27:02.229 --> 27:03.883
We need to talk.

27:03.926 --> 27:05.624
I heard about rehab.

27:05.667 --> 27:08.061
-You just getting out?
-Yeah, I--

27:08.104 --> 27:10.063
Look, I'm really proud of you.

27:10.106 --> 27:12.239
You faced your demons.

27:12.282 --> 27:13.893
I really do hope
that you found a way

27:13.936 --> 27:14.981
to some stability.

27:15.024 --> 27:18.245
Nick, what we had...

27:18.288 --> 27:21.204
our relationship...

27:21.248 --> 27:24.077
it was wrong.

27:24.120 --> 27:26.166
What are you talking about?

27:27.863 --> 27:29.299
You know
what I'm talking about.

27:29.343 --> 27:31.040
You--it--it was--

27:31.084 --> 27:33.129
It was over a long time ago.

27:35.131 --> 27:38.004
You can't train Izzy.

27:38.047 --> 27:41.398
You can't do to her
what you did to me.

27:41.442 --> 27:44.924
I didn't do anything to you,

27:44.967 --> 27:47.274
certainly nothing
you didn't want.

27:47.317 --> 27:49.102
You know that.

27:49.145 --> 27:51.757
And Izzy?
Izzy's an 11-year-old girl.

27:51.800 --> 27:53.193
-Nick.
-What are you saying that I am?

27:53.236 --> 27:55.761
No!
You know what's wrong?

27:55.804 --> 27:57.893
Me thinking I could take
another chance on you,

27:57.937 --> 27:59.895
thinking you'd changed.

28:00.983 --> 28:02.289
It is not surprising

28:02.332 --> 28:04.073
that you ended up in rehab,
'cause you're a joke.

28:04.117 --> 28:06.075
Everybody knows that.

28:06.119 --> 28:08.295
Look, I know that
self-destruction is your thing,

28:08.338 --> 28:10.340
but you're not taking me
down with you.

28:12.778 --> 28:14.170
No one's ever gonna
listen to you.

28:14.214 --> 28:15.345
And stay away from me.

28:40.196 --> 28:41.415
Hey.

28:41.458 --> 28:43.330
Weren't you coming in tomorrow?

28:43.373 --> 28:46.333
Yes, I was nearby
meeting a colleague.

28:46.376 --> 28:48.857
I got Edie's message
about the plea deal.

28:48.901 --> 28:50.816
Hey, just think of it
as a starting point

28:50.859 --> 28:52.905
for negotiation.

28:52.948 --> 28:55.298
Have a seat.

28:55.342 --> 28:56.865
You want a drink?

28:56.909 --> 28:58.998
Uh, yeah, actually--
yeah, I-I do.

28:59.041 --> 29:02.001
Is Edie here?

29:02.044 --> 29:05.395
Edie went...home.

29:07.876 --> 29:09.835
And for what it's worth,

29:09.878 --> 29:13.316
the whole team thinks
it's a crap deal.

29:13.360 --> 29:16.972
Yes, but, uh,
Edie's been the one

29:17.016 --> 29:19.148
who's, uh, been
on point, so...

29:19.192 --> 29:21.281
Yes, she's the one on point.

29:21.324 --> 29:22.804
Oh, I'm sorry.

29:22.848 --> 29:25.111
It's not that I don't
appreciate your efforts.

29:25.154 --> 29:27.548
-I get it.
-It's just Edie's my--

29:27.591 --> 29:29.289
she's my daughter.

29:29.332 --> 29:31.030
You know, I trust her,
and I--

29:31.073 --> 29:33.206
Yeah, I guess I just want
to hear her thoughts

29:33.249 --> 29:35.034
on exactly
what kind of game

29:35.077 --> 29:37.166
she thinks
this prosecutor's playing.

29:39.038 --> 29:42.345
Well, um...

29:42.389 --> 29:45.958
that's a little complicated
for Edie these days.

29:47.176 --> 29:48.787
What does that mean?

29:52.355 --> 29:54.880
Uh, Tim, what's going on?

29:56.925 --> 29:58.927
Edie is not at home.

30:00.973 --> 30:02.844
She moved out.

30:05.064 --> 30:06.979
Oh.

30:07.022 --> 30:08.284
Oh.

30:08.328 --> 30:11.810
Well, I'm--I'm sorry
to hear that.

30:11.853 --> 30:13.812
She's with Amanda Doherty.

30:15.465 --> 30:17.816
"With"?

30:17.859 --> 30:21.558
Involved with, sleeping with.

30:21.602 --> 30:23.212
With.

30:30.872 --> 30:33.005
Hey, Leon.

30:33.048 --> 30:35.834
Sorry I missed you earlier.
So what is it?

30:35.877 --> 30:38.445
What--what's the big emergency?

30:38.488 --> 30:40.751
Uh, Tim told me.

30:40.795 --> 30:41.970
Told you what?

30:42.014 --> 30:43.929
That your marriage is over
and that you've been

30:43.972 --> 30:45.756
in a secret,
intimate relationship

30:45.800 --> 30:49.935
with the prosecutor who intends
to send me to prison.

30:49.978 --> 30:52.459
Leon, I want to assure you

30:52.502 --> 30:54.678
that it hasn't affected
anything.

30:54.722 --> 30:57.159
Amanda and I...

30:57.203 --> 30:58.987
It's complicated.

30:59.031 --> 31:02.686
Mm, I guess complicated is
another word for unethical.

31:02.730 --> 31:05.951
Oh, okay, first of all,
who are you to judge my morals?

31:05.994 --> 31:09.041
Well, I'm your client,
and you've been lying to me.

31:09.084 --> 31:11.043
You want to call me out, throw
me under the bus, go ahead.

31:11.086 --> 31:12.914
I not gonna do that.
You're my daughter.

31:14.524 --> 31:16.613
But I am gonna ask you
to step down.

31:16.657 --> 31:17.788
What?

31:17.832 --> 31:19.094
Let Tim take over.

31:19.138 --> 31:21.531
-Leon.
-You're fired, Edie.

31:32.499 --> 31:34.109
How could you do that?

31:34.153 --> 31:36.633
Why?
Why would you tell Leon?

31:36.677 --> 31:38.766
Because I didn't want to lie
to our client.

31:38.809 --> 31:40.986
Or should I say
continue to lie?

31:41.029 --> 31:43.205
I have never compromised
this case.

31:43.249 --> 31:44.598
You know that.

31:44.641 --> 31:46.687
Look, I get it.
I get you're angry.

31:46.730 --> 31:49.081
I-I understand that,
but are you trying

31:49.124 --> 31:50.734
to burn my career
to the ground?

31:50.778 --> 31:52.780
-Is that what you want, Tim?
-You lit the match, Edie.

31:52.823 --> 31:54.738
-These are your choices.
-Mine?

31:54.782 --> 31:57.741
Yes, exactly, my choices.

31:57.785 --> 32:00.005
So what are you,
like, a stepmom now?

32:00.048 --> 32:01.571
What?

32:01.615 --> 32:02.921
Enzo.

32:04.531 --> 32:07.142
That was just
a little something.

32:07.186 --> 32:10.624
He--he got an A.
We wanted to celebrate.

32:10.667 --> 32:13.627
Every single time I brought up
having kids with you,

32:13.670 --> 32:14.976
it was like a third rail.

32:15.020 --> 32:16.978
-I know.
-But I get it.

32:17.022 --> 32:19.067
You just didn't want to start
a family with me.

32:28.685 --> 32:29.860
Hey.

32:29.904 --> 32:31.514
-There you are.
-JULIA: Hey.

32:31.558 --> 32:33.125
Uh, I saw you canceled
our appointment.

32:33.168 --> 32:35.257
Yeah, yeah.
I-I did.

32:35.301 --> 32:36.650
Okay.

32:36.693 --> 32:39.044
Can I ask where you're at
with that, then?

32:39.087 --> 32:40.915
The egg freezing,
'cause hormones would be

32:40.959 --> 32:42.482
the next step.

32:42.525 --> 32:46.007
Maybe there are no next steps,
at least for now.

32:46.051 --> 32:48.488
-Okay.
-Sorry.

32:48.531 --> 32:51.795
I know you were dying
to show me all your ovaries.

32:51.839 --> 32:55.277
No, there's, uh--there's
always time for that.

32:55.321 --> 32:58.715
Thank you for being my doctor.

32:58.759 --> 33:01.980
It was nice to talk
to some--talk to you

33:02.023 --> 33:03.590
about all this stuff.

33:03.633 --> 33:06.985
Hmm.
So is this about Donovan or...?

33:07.028 --> 33:09.726
No, actually,
it's, um--it's not.

33:09.770 --> 33:13.121
I...I had the talk
with my dad,

33:13.165 --> 33:14.862
and...

33:14.905 --> 33:17.125
I'm not sure I can think
about my future

33:17.169 --> 33:20.041
until I figure out my past.

33:20.085 --> 33:21.738
How'd it go?

33:21.782 --> 33:23.697
Apparently
he's always known,

33:23.740 --> 33:26.004
and he refuses to discuss it
with me.

33:26.047 --> 33:28.006
Yeah, of course.

33:28.049 --> 33:30.573
Mm, I'm sorry, Julia.

33:30.617 --> 33:33.011
Everything always has to be
on his terms.

33:33.054 --> 33:35.013
Yeah, that's your dad.

33:35.056 --> 33:36.710
Why?

33:36.753 --> 33:39.017
Why does it always have to be
so complicated with him?

33:39.060 --> 33:42.759
Why can't it just be simple?
It was like that with my mom.

33:42.803 --> 33:44.631
Or at least I thought it was.

33:44.674 --> 33:46.937
I mean...
Who knows?

33:46.981 --> 33:48.852
Maybe I don't even know
who she was anymore

33:48.896 --> 33:51.812
or who I am, for that matter.

33:51.855 --> 33:54.162
You're still you, okay,
with all of the amazing

33:54.206 --> 33:58.340
and annoying qualities
that you've always had.

33:58.384 --> 34:00.168
You're a rock.

34:02.214 --> 34:03.824
You'll get through this.

34:10.048 --> 34:13.181
-ROXY: Whose shoes are these?
-Mine.

34:13.225 --> 34:14.661
Sorry.

34:14.704 --> 34:15.879
Why are they
by the front door?

34:15.923 --> 34:18.012
What, are we in Japan now?

34:18.056 --> 34:21.015
-Um...
-They're a hazard.

34:21.059 --> 34:23.104
-BOTH: Whoa.
-Roxy, what's going on?

34:24.888 --> 34:27.848
I'm such an idiot.

34:27.891 --> 34:30.242
I let him do it again.
I let him.

34:30.285 --> 34:32.200
-What are we talking about?
-Nick.

34:32.244 --> 34:33.723
What happened?

34:35.899 --> 34:38.076
I saw him.

34:38.119 --> 34:40.904
I went to confront him.

34:42.297 --> 34:44.604
And suddenly, it was like, um,
I was 16 again.

34:44.647 --> 34:46.606
You know, and I'm paralyzed,

34:46.649 --> 34:47.998
and I can't put
two sentences together.

34:49.696 --> 34:51.219
That was really brave of you.

34:52.699 --> 34:55.223
And he's so charming,
you know.

34:55.267 --> 34:59.358
And he looks at you,
and he--he tells you

34:59.401 --> 35:01.751
he can deliver you
to Nationals,

35:01.795 --> 35:05.625
and he can make
all your dreams come true.

35:05.668 --> 35:09.411
And he makes you feel like
a grown-up...

35:09.455 --> 35:12.719
and that you're not like
the other girls...

35:12.762 --> 35:15.025
and that you have
a real relationship.

35:15.069 --> 35:16.940
No, no.

35:16.984 --> 35:21.031
He is a controlling,
manipulative predator.

35:21.075 --> 35:22.642
You were a minor.

35:22.685 --> 35:24.731
The statute of limitations
has not run out

35:24.774 --> 35:26.341
You just say the word,
I will start the process--

35:26.385 --> 35:28.169
No.
It won't work.

35:28.213 --> 35:30.258
Okay?
It doesn't matter.

35:30.302 --> 35:31.955
He still has all the power.

35:34.219 --> 35:37.047
You know, in--in rehab,
they told me that I need

35:37.091 --> 35:39.180
to "speak my truth."

35:41.226 --> 35:43.880
What does that matter
if no one's gonna believe me?

35:43.924 --> 35:46.144
-Rox.
-ROXY: God.

35:46.187 --> 35:47.884
They're just gonna say

35:47.928 --> 35:49.669
all these terrible things
about me,

35:49.712 --> 35:51.192
which, by the way, are true.

35:51.236 --> 35:53.803
It's my fault.

35:53.847 --> 35:55.283
I gave them
too much ammunition.

35:55.327 --> 35:58.156
Hey, no, it is not your fault.
We believe you.

35:58.199 --> 36:00.332
And anyone who knows you
and loves you

36:00.375 --> 36:03.030
will believe you, too.

36:03.073 --> 36:04.988
You have to say that.
You're family.

36:13.388 --> 36:15.216
JULIA:
She would have loved those.

36:25.270 --> 36:27.881
You ever talk to her
when you come here?

36:27.924 --> 36:32.190
No, um, not out loud...

36:32.233 --> 36:36.237
but to myself,
private conversation.

36:36.281 --> 36:40.241
It try to be private,
but I just can't help myself.

36:40.285 --> 36:43.766
I end up sitting here babbling
like a crazy person.

36:48.858 --> 36:51.209
Dad, we have to be able
to talk about this.

36:51.252 --> 36:54.386
I can't just pretend like
I don't know what I know...

36:56.170 --> 36:59.217
Even though you want me to.

36:59.260 --> 37:01.784
I need to know what happened.

37:01.828 --> 37:04.787
You need to tell me
what happened.

37:06.441 --> 37:09.052
There isn't--
there isn't a lot to tell.

37:09.096 --> 37:13.361
Uh, your mother and I were
going through a rough time,

37:13.405 --> 37:17.887
and, um...she had a fling.

37:17.931 --> 37:20.760
And she assured me
that it was a one-time thing.

37:20.803 --> 37:22.979
And I believed her.

37:26.287 --> 37:28.855
That's it?

37:28.898 --> 37:30.813
You have to know
more than that.

37:30.857 --> 37:33.294
No, I-I didn't want
to know more.

37:33.338 --> 37:38.256
You know, it didn't matter
to me that you weren't mine.

37:38.299 --> 37:41.302
That was just a data point.
The less I knew, the better.

37:41.346 --> 37:46.002
'Cause when it came to you,
Julia, I did not hesitate.

37:46.046 --> 37:48.440
But you kept it from me.
You lied to me.

37:48.483 --> 37:50.180
I wanted to protect you.

37:50.224 --> 37:52.008
Did you?

37:52.052 --> 37:54.315
Or did you want to
protect yourself?

37:54.359 --> 37:56.274
-Julia, please--
-Dad.

37:58.580 --> 38:01.583
I...I need more.

38:01.627 --> 38:04.412
I need to know more.

38:04.456 --> 38:08.198
