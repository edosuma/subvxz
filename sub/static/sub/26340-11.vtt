WEBVTT

00:03.237 --> 00:05.673
Hey, Charlie, there you are.

00:05.706 --> 00:07.508
You forgot your hat
in the dining room.

00:07.541 --> 00:09.743
I don't think
I've ever seen you without it.

00:09.777 --> 00:12.313
Thought maybe you had a Mohawk
under there. (chuckles)

00:12.346 --> 00:14.948
No, I didn't forget it.

00:14.982 --> 00:17.685
I'm courting a woman.

00:17.718 --> 00:19.887
I never wear my hat
when I'm courting.

00:19.920 --> 00:21.155
How do I look?

00:21.189 --> 00:23.191
Cool?

00:23.224 --> 00:26.160
So, tell me about this woman.

00:26.194 --> 00:27.995
Well, her name is Kathleen.

00:28.028 --> 00:30.998
She hosts a group here
three times a week.

00:31.031 --> 00:33.867
And the moment I saw her,
I fell hard, man.

00:33.901 --> 00:35.736
Wow, Charlie, I've never
heard you talk like this.

00:35.769 --> 00:37.438
It's so sweet.

00:37.471 --> 00:38.806
So, what are you doing?

00:38.839 --> 00:40.474
You meeting up for lunch,
you going to a movie?

00:40.508 --> 00:42.676
Oh, God, no.

00:42.710 --> 00:44.278
We've never talked.

00:44.312 --> 00:47.348
No, that happens in six
to eight weeks. I have a system.

00:47.381 --> 00:49.350
Right now we're in phase two.

00:49.383 --> 00:52.253
It's what the Mossad calls
"Intelligence Gathering."

00:52.286 --> 00:54.021
Okay, see, the word "Mossad"

00:54.054 --> 00:56.424
should never factor into
your dating game.

00:56.457 --> 00:59.360
I got a crazy idea--
why don't you just talk to her?

00:59.393 --> 01:00.994
-Talk to her?
-(laughs)

01:01.028 --> 01:02.896
Margaret, can you be serious
for a second?

01:02.930 --> 01:05.233
This is my life
we're talking about.

01:05.266 --> 01:07.368
What is the issue?

01:07.401 --> 01:10.238
Well, I haven't dated in
forever, and I got to go slow.

01:10.271 --> 01:12.406
After six divorces,
you start to think

01:12.440 --> 01:15.075
maybe you're bad with women.

01:15.109 --> 01:17.878
-Thank you.
-Oh, there she is.

01:17.911 --> 01:20.381
Wow, Charlie,

01:20.414 --> 01:22.350
-she's beautiful.
-Mm-hmm.

01:22.383 --> 01:25.853
You sure you don't want to set
your sights a little lower?

01:25.886 --> 01:29.257
How about this cute gal in here
with the eye patch?

01:29.290 --> 01:33.194
Uh, no, I don't like
her politics.

01:33.227 --> 01:35.529
Kathleen's the one.

01:35.563 --> 01:37.198
Well, then I got
a new system for you.

01:37.231 --> 01:38.366
-Turn around.
-What?

01:38.399 --> 01:40.234
-Get over there.
-Wh...

01:40.268 --> 01:41.502
Oh! (chuckles)

01:41.535 --> 01:43.937
Hello. Um, hi.

01:43.971 --> 01:45.673
Are you here for the group?

01:45.706 --> 01:49.510
Um, I'll answer that question
in six to eight weeks.

01:49.543 --> 01:50.711
(quietly):
Oh, my God.

01:50.744 --> 01:54.248
Oh.

01:54.282 --> 01:56.917
Knew we should've started
with the eye patch gal.

01:59.787 --> 02:01.789
*

02:21.809 --> 02:24.912
Um, Allison?

02:24.945 --> 02:27.448
I just wanted
to extend a thank-you

02:27.481 --> 02:31.084
for asking me to be the anchor
of the Shady Meadows News.

02:31.118 --> 02:33.321
Mm. I don't know
if I'd call it news.

02:33.354 --> 02:35.823
It's just reading
the daily announcements.

02:35.856 --> 02:38.559
So I assume that you realized
that the broadcast

02:38.592 --> 02:42.330
needed a jolt of my gravitas?

02:42.363 --> 02:46.500
No, I realized the guy
who used to do it died.

02:46.534 --> 02:49.437
Go away, Allison.

02:52.139 --> 02:56.410
Wow, the Shady Meadows News.

02:56.444 --> 02:59.380
Hank, have you been practicing
your anchorman voice?

02:59.413 --> 03:00.948
Check this out.

03:00.981 --> 03:04.084
You've been watching
the Shady Meadows News

03:04.117 --> 03:06.354
with Hank Henderson.
Good night.

03:06.387 --> 03:08.322
And to my Spanish-speaking
viewers,

03:08.356 --> 03:12.025
buenas... night.

03:12.059 --> 03:15.229
You guys, Margaret made me
talk to a woman.

03:15.263 --> 03:18.098
And get this,
I had just started phase two.

03:18.131 --> 03:20.868
What? That is crazy.

03:20.901 --> 03:23.471
Phase two usually lasts six
to eight weeks.

03:23.504 --> 03:25.205
Wait a minute,
you guys know about all this

03:25.239 --> 03:27.408
crazy phase stuff and you
haven't tried to help him?

03:27.441 --> 03:29.810
Girl, we've been trying
to help him for years.

03:29.843 --> 03:32.346
Yeah, I mean, if a couple of
primo studs like me and Sid

03:32.380 --> 03:33.947
can't help him out, nobody can.

03:33.981 --> 03:36.484
(laughs)
Primo studs?

03:36.517 --> 03:38.852
You two?

03:38.886 --> 03:41.154
We're just gonna let that go by?

03:41.188 --> 03:43.724
(Margaret continues laughing)

03:43.757 --> 03:45.225
Okay.

03:45.259 --> 03:47.628
Maybe I'm just hopeless.

03:47.661 --> 03:49.397
Oh, Charlie,
you're not hopeless.

03:49.430 --> 03:52.300
You're just getting advice
from people who are hopeless.

03:52.333 --> 03:54.234
And do you think you could
do better?

03:54.268 --> 03:56.404
Like you're some
great wingwoman?

03:56.437 --> 03:57.971
Hell yes, I am.

03:58.005 --> 03:59.540
If Charlie takes my advice,

03:59.573 --> 04:01.509
he'll be with Kathleen
by the end of the week.

04:01.542 --> 04:04.312
Wow, 'cause I got a great
first date planned.

04:04.345 --> 04:07.848
We're gonna
help my buddy Dave move.

04:07.881 --> 04:10.584
End of the month.

04:14.522 --> 04:17.925
Everyone, take a seat, please.

04:17.958 --> 04:20.461
Oh, happy to see a couple
new faces here.

04:20.494 --> 04:23.597
That's me.
She's talking about my face.

04:23.631 --> 04:24.832
Yeah. You see?

04:24.865 --> 04:26.534
-This is all courtesy of
your wingwoman.
-Yeah.

04:26.567 --> 04:29.370
So, let's just pretend like
we belong in her group,

04:29.403 --> 04:30.971
and then when it's over,
we'll introduce ourselves

04:31.004 --> 04:32.540
-and I'll talk you up.
-Okay.

04:32.573 --> 04:34.041
What do you think this group
is about, anyway?

04:34.074 --> 04:35.909
Oh, I hope it's not AA

04:35.943 --> 04:37.711
'cause I still got
my lunch buzz going.

04:37.745 --> 04:41.949
Well, fingers crossed
it's sex addicts.

04:45.586 --> 04:48.422
(sighs)

04:48.456 --> 04:50.891
Jesse, do you want to go first?

04:50.924 --> 04:54.428
H-Hi. I-I'm Jesse.

04:54.462 --> 04:56.764
-Yeah.
-It's been a tough couple
of years.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.566
I-I still miss my wife.

04:58.599 --> 05:00.434
Perfect.
I think this is some kind of

05:00.468 --> 05:02.903
a sad-sack singles group.

05:02.936 --> 05:05.573
Aw... That's okay.

05:05.606 --> 05:08.909
Everyone deals with the death
of a spouse differently.

05:14.114 --> 05:18.318
They could still be sex addicts.

05:18.352 --> 05:20.888
Thanks for letting me
tag along, buddy.

05:20.921 --> 05:23.123
I've always had an interest
in show business.

05:23.156 --> 05:26.360
It's gonna be fun to finally
get a peek behind the curtain.

05:26.394 --> 05:29.730
Well, peek away, Sidney.
This is it!

05:29.763 --> 05:33.100
The big time.

05:35.002 --> 05:37.070
Oh, uh, Allison?

05:37.104 --> 05:39.573
Just so I can get an idea
of our audience,

05:39.607 --> 05:41.174
what sort of ratings
are you, uh,

05:41.208 --> 05:42.810
looking for
in our key demographic?

05:42.843 --> 05:45.613
Well, this is closed-circuit TV
in a retirement community.

05:45.646 --> 05:48.616
There are baby monitors
reaching a bigger audience.

05:48.649 --> 05:53.020
(chuckles) Look at this.

05:53.053 --> 05:56.023
Oh, feels good.

05:56.056 --> 05:58.025
Oh, yeah.

05:58.058 --> 05:59.627
Well, let me just...
(clears throat)

05:59.660 --> 06:01.662
...do my vocal-- (clears throat)
my vocal warm-ups.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.597
Bi-bim-bap. (clears throat)

06:03.631 --> 06:05.566
(lower):
Bi-bi-bim-bap.

06:05.599 --> 06:09.837
I'll-I'll have the bi-bim-bap.
(sputters)

06:09.870 --> 06:12.172
(yowls)

06:12.205 --> 06:14.508
All good on this end.
Y'all ready to rock and roll?

06:14.542 --> 06:15.776
Sure, Hank.

06:15.809 --> 06:17.310
We go live in three,

06:17.344 --> 06:18.979
two, one. Action.

06:24.852 --> 06:25.953
(quietly):
Hank.

06:25.986 --> 06:27.721
Read the script.

06:30.090 --> 06:32.192
Read it out loud, Hank.

06:32.225 --> 06:34.862
(whispering):
The, um, golf course is closed

06:34.895 --> 06:36.597
due to the recent swan attacks.

06:36.630 --> 06:39.332
Our thoughts are with Ronnie
Sinclair for a speedy recovery.

06:39.366 --> 06:41.001
How is he so bad at this?

06:41.034 --> 06:42.870
All he has to do
is read the menu,

06:42.903 --> 06:44.271
the events,
and the death of the day.

06:44.304 --> 06:45.506
I know.

06:45.539 --> 06:47.407
It's like, "There's pot roast

06:47.441 --> 06:50.043
"in the kitchen,
square dancing in the rec room,

06:50.077 --> 06:54.915
and Marilyn Bartlett
is in the ground." Boom!

06:54.948 --> 06:57.485
Yeah. Exactly like that.

06:57.518 --> 06:58.919
HANK (whispering):
You guys, don't forget about,

06:58.952 --> 07:01.922
uh, bingo Wednesday and...

07:01.955 --> 07:03.991
(whispering indistinctly)

07:04.024 --> 07:05.092
We still can't hear you, Hank.

07:05.125 --> 07:08.629
(loudly):
Um, this week, we got...

07:08.662 --> 07:11.899
We got Salisbury steak this week
in the kitchen.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.701
-(microphone feedback squeals)
-I like Salisbury steak

07:13.734 --> 07:16.670
'cause it's good.

07:16.704 --> 07:19.272
Um...

07:19.306 --> 07:21.208
This guy sucks!

07:23.010 --> 07:24.878
(exhales)
We got to get out of here.

07:24.912 --> 07:26.514
We do not have dead spouses.

07:26.547 --> 07:28.782
I certainly wish my ex was dead,
but this is wrong.

07:28.816 --> 07:29.983
No, no, no, no, no.

07:30.017 --> 07:32.252
-This is amazing.
-(scoffs)

07:32.285 --> 07:35.055
I mean, I'm-I'm sitting
next to Kathleen

07:35.088 --> 07:37.224
and she smells like cinnamon
and dreams.

07:37.257 --> 07:38.692
I mean, look at her, Margaret.

07:38.726 --> 07:40.561
She's an angel.

07:40.594 --> 07:44.097
My wife's an angel now, too.

07:44.131 --> 07:46.266
This guy gets it.

07:46.299 --> 07:49.803
Oh, do you want
to share with us?

07:49.837 --> 07:51.271
He does not. He's good.

07:51.304 --> 07:53.140
He's not a sharer. Uh, next.

07:53.173 --> 07:55.108
This dude looks pretty sad.

07:57.444 --> 07:59.780
It's okay, sweetie.

07:59.813 --> 08:04.417
Remember, everyone,
this is a safe space.

08:04.451 --> 08:06.153
A sacred space.

08:06.186 --> 08:08.656
Do you hear that?
Sacred. We got to go.

08:08.689 --> 08:11.324
No, she called me sweetie.

08:12.993 --> 08:16.163
Don't you want
to speak your truth?

08:16.196 --> 08:19.332
-So you can move forward?
-Mm.

08:19.366 --> 08:22.369
Um, the truth is...

08:22.402 --> 08:24.705
I got a dead wife.

08:30.644 --> 08:33.814
I'm gonna get my groove back
on today's broadcast.

08:33.847 --> 08:36.283
You know, I figured out
why I had my little, uh,

08:36.316 --> 08:38.952
issue yesterday.
I wasn't properly hydrated.

08:38.986 --> 08:41.722
Oh, Hank, you really think
it was a hydration issue

08:41.755 --> 08:43.523
and not just stage fright?

08:43.557 --> 08:45.158
Stage fright?
That's ridiculous.

08:45.192 --> 08:47.394
(chuckles) I just got to get
my waters right.

08:48.729 --> 08:50.998
Why did you tell her
you had a dead wife?

08:51.031 --> 08:54.301
I panicked, okay? I blew it.

08:54.334 --> 08:57.537
Or did I?
Hey, hear me out.

08:57.571 --> 09:00.674
What if we killed
one of my ex-wives?

09:00.708 --> 09:03.677
I'm thinking of Joyce.
She's the slowest.

09:03.711 --> 09:06.614
Y'all talking about
killing wives?

09:06.647 --> 09:10.718
Well, I guess that wingwoman
thing isn't going so well.

09:10.751 --> 09:12.452
She did her best.

09:12.485 --> 09:14.588
I mean, it's me
she's dealing with here,

09:14.622 --> 09:16.657
not a couple of primo studs
like you two.

09:16.690 --> 09:21.061
Okay, gonna have to flag the
"primo stud" thing right now.

09:21.094 --> 09:23.363
Don't change the subject,
Margaret.

09:23.396 --> 09:26.533
Admit it, you tried to be
Charlie's wingwoman

09:26.566 --> 09:28.368
and you failed.

09:28.401 --> 09:31.038
So say it:
"I'm a red-headed failure."

09:31.071 --> 09:32.706
Say it!

09:32.740 --> 09:35.676
I am not a red-headed failure.

09:35.709 --> 09:38.612
This is "sparkling sherry."

09:40.580 --> 09:42.582
We're gonna get Kathleen
for you,

09:42.616 --> 09:45.485
and we're gonna shut up
these primo studs.

09:45.518 --> 09:48.421
Primo studs? Us?

09:48.455 --> 09:51.291
How sweet of you, Margaret.
Thank you.

09:58.565 --> 10:00.868
(exhales):
Ah...

10:00.901 --> 10:02.369
My levels are good.

10:02.402 --> 10:03.937
The Hank tank is full.

10:03.971 --> 10:06.273
Let's make some news!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:06.306 --> 10:08.141
What's going on, Allison?

10:08.175 --> 10:09.843
Why they got two chairs
at the desk?

10:09.877 --> 10:12.179
And why does one of them
have three phone books on it?

10:12.212 --> 10:14.447
They're for my bottom.

10:14.481 --> 10:16.583
Surprise!
We're gonna be cohosts.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.085
Wait, what?

10:18.118 --> 10:20.253
Is this 'cause of
what happened yesterday?

10:20.287 --> 10:23.490
I told you,
that was a hydration issue.

10:23.523 --> 10:24.858
I solved it!

10:24.892 --> 10:27.594
You hear all that sloshing?

10:27.627 --> 10:30.463
Oh, I'm just here
for emotional support.

10:30.497 --> 10:32.499
You're still the star, baby.

10:32.532 --> 10:34.868
Yeah, well, why do I
only got one line?

10:34.902 --> 10:36.804
"Hi, I'm Hank Henderson.

10:36.837 --> 10:38.238
-Here's Sid."
-Ooh.

10:38.271 --> 10:40.974
Did I not cut that line?

10:41.008 --> 10:43.310
Maybe we could
give him one more line.

10:43.343 --> 10:46.113
I don't want your pity lines!

10:46.146 --> 10:47.681
This is an atrocity.

10:47.715 --> 10:49.549
I gave birth to this baby,
and you're gonna let him

10:49.582 --> 10:51.451
just steal it
and raise it himself?

10:51.484 --> 10:54.154
You trying
to Rumpelstiltskin my ass!

10:54.187 --> 10:56.790
And don't say,
"Oh, no, Hank, we not trying

10:56.824 --> 10:59.626
to Rumpelstiltskin your ass,"
'cause that sounds just like

10:59.659 --> 11:01.628
something Rumpelstiltskin
would say!

11:01.661 --> 11:03.096
This is so predictable, Allison.

11:03.130 --> 11:05.465
-That's why your show sucks.
-Hank,

11:05.498 --> 11:07.768
-take a breath.
-Nah, I'm-a take a breath
'cause I want to take breath.

11:07.801 --> 11:09.336
I ain't taking a breath just
'cause you told me to take

11:09.369 --> 11:11.471
a breath. I feel like
taking a breath. (inhales)

11:11.504 --> 11:14.842
I'm walking, you
Rumpelstiltskin-ass suckers!

11:18.645 --> 11:20.613
Yikes.

11:20.647 --> 11:23.650
That was devastating to watch.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.886
I don't know

11:25.919 --> 11:29.790
if I'll be even able to perform.

11:29.823 --> 11:31.792
Three, two, one.

11:31.825 --> 11:34.161
Good evening, Shady Meadows!

11:35.662 --> 11:38.631
Elaine Jenkinson's
left her dentures

11:38.665 --> 11:40.567
in the dining hall today.

11:40.600 --> 11:43.103
When asked for a comment,
Elaine said,

11:43.136 --> 11:46.139
(speaks gibberish, laughs)

11:46.173 --> 11:48.976
"Where's my teeth?"

11:49.009 --> 11:51.812
(laughter)

11:51.845 --> 11:53.613
Coming to this group
is your only shot

11:53.646 --> 11:56.283
at making a real connection
with Kathleen.

11:56.316 --> 11:58.351
And in order to do that,
we have to make your lie

11:58.385 --> 12:00.353
emotionally true.

12:00.387 --> 12:02.189
I mean, this group
is about loss, Charlie.

12:02.222 --> 12:04.191
You've experienced loss, right?

12:04.224 --> 12:08.395
Well, I still can't find
the clicker for my Roku.

12:09.396 --> 12:12.399
Dig even deeper.

12:12.432 --> 12:14.935
I once had a dog.

12:14.968 --> 12:18.939
And when that pooch died,
a part of me died, too.

12:18.972 --> 12:21.574
That is great.

12:21.608 --> 12:25.345
Okay. So, when you're talking
about your fake dead wife,

12:25.378 --> 12:28.782
-Mm-hmm?
-be thinking about
your real dead dog.

12:28.816 --> 12:30.851
-Got it.
-Oh, and, uh,
don't mention the Roku.

12:30.884 --> 12:32.052
-Got it.
-Yeah.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.420
Do or don't?

12:33.453 --> 12:35.388
Don't.

12:35.422 --> 12:37.390
Got it.

12:37.424 --> 12:40.027
And just to be clear, um,
it's the Roku remote.

12:40.060 --> 12:42.029
I have the Roku.
(chuckles)

12:42.062 --> 12:45.298
That's the frustrating part
of this whole thing.

12:49.236 --> 12:53.974
Well, shall we all get started?

12:54.007 --> 12:58.378
Charlie, you were beginning
to share at the last session.

12:58.411 --> 13:00.647
-Mm-hmm.
-Would you like to keep going?

13:01.915 --> 13:04.684
Okay. But it's...

13:04.717 --> 13:07.420
it's kind of hard because, um,

13:07.454 --> 13:10.057
-she was my best friend.
-Oh.

13:10.090 --> 13:13.126
-She had soulful eyes.
-Ah.

13:13.160 --> 13:14.561
Oh, gee.

13:14.594 --> 13:16.763
Great, big ears.

13:16.796 --> 13:20.700
(chuckles):
Oh, dear.

13:20.733 --> 13:23.436
And a tail
that just wouldn't quit.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.038
(Kathleen chuckles)

13:25.072 --> 13:28.808
Well, attraction is important.

13:28.842 --> 13:30.844
We used to love to play Frisbee.

13:30.878 --> 13:32.445
Oh.

13:32.479 --> 13:35.949
She'd always fall asleep
right between my legs.

13:42.956 --> 13:46.293
She chewed the hell
out of our couch. (chuckles)

13:46.326 --> 13:47.794
Well, after a hard day
at the office,

13:47.827 --> 13:50.597
who hasn't chewed
a couch? I mean,

13:50.630 --> 13:53.833
I mean, that's just
called being human.

13:58.105 --> 14:00.840
What was her name?

14:00.874 --> 14:03.310
Please let it be a human name.

14:03.343 --> 14:06.446
Her name was Buttons.

14:06.479 --> 14:08.081
Oh! Oh.

14:08.115 --> 14:10.517
It's okay. Let it out.

14:19.392 --> 14:21.028
-(laughs)
-Yeah.

14:21.061 --> 14:23.030
I still can't believe that
dog-wife story worked.

14:23.063 --> 14:24.898
Especially after
you told everybody

14:24.932 --> 14:27.467
how she used to rub her ass
on the carpet.

14:27.500 --> 14:28.635
(laughs)

14:28.668 --> 14:31.104
But, hey, it got you a date.

14:31.138 --> 14:32.605
Yeah. I-Is it a date?

14:32.639 --> 14:35.475
'Cause she said
it was follow-up therapy.

14:35.508 --> 14:38.111
Mm, any one-on-one conversation
can become a date.

14:38.145 --> 14:39.913
-Okay.
-You just got to steer it away

14:39.947 --> 14:42.215
from the grief stuff.
Try and keep it light.

14:42.249 --> 14:44.517
Okay. I could talk about lasers.

14:48.621 --> 14:50.357
You know what, Charlie?

14:50.390 --> 14:54.027
If you want to talk about
lasers, you talk about lasers.

14:54.061 --> 14:57.164
All right? And, uh, just
remember, you're not a loser,

14:57.197 --> 14:58.598
you're a catch.

14:58.631 --> 15:00.000
And I got a backup plan

15:00.033 --> 15:01.334
-if it starts to go south.
-Thank you.

15:04.104 --> 15:06.073
Oh. Hi, Kathleen.

15:06.106 --> 15:07.874
-Hi.
-Thank you for coming.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.442
Of course.

15:09.476 --> 15:12.946
You made a big breakthrough
in group this week,

15:12.980 --> 15:14.982
and I'm-I'm proud of you.

15:15.015 --> 15:17.017
-Oh.
-(chuckles)

15:17.050 --> 15:20.653
Well, it's courtesy of the
hottest therapist I've ever met.

15:20.687 --> 15:22.522
(chuckles)
Sit down.

15:22.555 --> 15:24.924
Uh, okay.

15:28.395 --> 15:32.532
Um, I brought some grief
pamphlets you might find useful.

15:32.565 --> 15:34.234
Uh-huh. Well, good news.

15:34.267 --> 15:35.868
-I don't need them.
-Oh!

15:35.902 --> 15:39.006
-(chuckles)
-You're that good.

15:39.039 --> 15:43.943
One of those pamphlets you just
tossed aside is about avoidance.

15:43.977 --> 15:46.546
Are any of them
about how beautiful

15:46.579 --> 15:48.548
you look in the afternoon sun?

15:48.581 --> 15:51.151
I mean, not that I've been
watching you from afar.

15:51.184 --> 15:53.253
-(laughs)
-I'm-- that-that's what
the Mossad does,

15:53.286 --> 15:54.687
but I would never...

15:54.721 --> 15:55.955
Hey, Charlie!

15:55.989 --> 15:58.858
And, uh, and Kathleen, is it?

15:58.891 --> 16:01.561
Uh, yes.
You're in my grief group.

16:01.594 --> 16:04.364
I, uh, I happen to have
this freshly-opened bottle

16:04.397 --> 16:07.000
-of champagne.
-Why?

16:07.034 --> 16:11.504
I was on my way to a boat
christening. (chuckles)

16:11.538 --> 16:13.473
-In Arizona?
-Yeah, well,

16:13.506 --> 16:16.109
they canceled it.

16:16.143 --> 16:18.911
Anyway, so this, uh,
this hooch is up for grabs.

16:18.945 --> 16:20.813
Would you like some?

16:20.847 --> 16:22.882
-No, I think
we're-we're good here.
-No, no, no, no.

16:22.915 --> 16:26.186
Drink the champagne,
Charlie. Enjoy.

16:26.219 --> 16:28.988
Oh, that's...

16:31.524 --> 16:34.761
(laughs) Well, I-I don't
usually drink champagne

16:34.794 --> 16:36.429
this early in the day.

16:36.463 --> 16:38.398
Yeah. More of a whiskey
in the morning kind of gal?

16:38.431 --> 16:41.501
(laughs)
Charlie. You're funny.

16:41.534 --> 16:42.835
Really?

16:42.869 --> 16:45.705
Well...

16:45.738 --> 16:49.042
this is wildly inappropriate
for a therapy session,

16:49.076 --> 16:53.680
but would you like to clink
with your shrink?

16:53.713 --> 16:55.448
-(laughs)
-You like lasers?

16:55.482 --> 16:57.384
-I do.
-(gasps)

16:57.417 --> 16:59.386
(both laugh)

17:08.061 --> 17:09.462
Sid, we need to talk.

17:09.496 --> 17:11.030
I've been looking everywhere
for you.

17:11.064 --> 17:12.899
Yeah, I've been trying
to keep a low profile.

17:12.932 --> 17:14.634
My show kind of blew up.

17:14.667 --> 17:18.638
Allison said
tens of people watched.

17:18.671 --> 17:21.808
So you think you got fans now,
after one show?

17:21.841 --> 17:26.179
Mr. Delacroix, will you sign
an autograph for my friend?

17:26.213 --> 17:28.715
Sure. What's your friend's name,
Dudley?

17:28.748 --> 17:31.651
Uh... uh, Dudley?

17:31.684 --> 17:34.053
So I assume you're gonna
want my autograph, too?

17:34.087 --> 17:35.688
This is awkward.

17:35.722 --> 17:38.825
I can't believe you betrayed me
like that.

17:38.858 --> 17:40.193
When I walked out of that door,

17:40.227 --> 17:41.694
you should've been
right behind me.

17:41.728 --> 17:44.297
Well, I would've,
but there's one problem, Hank.

17:44.331 --> 17:46.966
I'm a friggin' newsman.

17:48.968 --> 17:51.904
In three, two, one.

17:51.938 --> 17:53.906
Hello, Shady Meadows!

17:53.940 --> 17:55.942
(upbeat music playing)

18:01.881 --> 18:04.851
You guys mind if I pop on
the old boob tube?

18:04.884 --> 18:08.087
-I never miss Sid's show.
-MARGARET: No, wait, wait.

18:08.121 --> 18:09.622
MARGARET:
Dudley. Dudley,

18:09.656 --> 18:11.391
turn off the TV. Turn...

18:11.424 --> 18:14.327
People are trying to fall
in love over here.

18:14.361 --> 18:16.729
HANK:
We're not done, Sid.

18:16.763 --> 18:19.199
Hank, we are on the air.

18:19.232 --> 18:20.600
Yeah, well, the only reason
why you're on the air

18:20.633 --> 18:22.235
is 'cause you stole my show.

18:22.269 --> 18:23.870
I deserve that chair

18:23.903 --> 18:26.005
and all of the respect
that comes with it.

18:26.038 --> 18:28.275
You could've had
that respect, Hank.

18:28.308 --> 18:30.277
All you had to do
was share it with me.

18:30.310 --> 18:35.148
But no, you have to always
be the center of attention.

18:35.182 --> 18:37.684
Here's a newsflash: you sucked.

18:37.717 --> 18:40.320
You were a flipping disaster.

18:40.353 --> 18:42.555
Oh, yeah? Well, Charlie
was a disaster, too,

18:42.589 --> 18:45.024
but Margaret didn't give up
on him. You know why?

18:45.057 --> 18:46.693
'Cause she's a good friend.

18:46.726 --> 18:49.329
Oh, you really want to use
Margaret as an example?

18:49.362 --> 18:53.065
She's having Charlie pretend
to have a dead wife

18:53.099 --> 18:56.569
so he can bang
a grief counselor!

19:12.285 --> 19:14.321
Sidney.

19:14.354 --> 19:17.023
Hanklin.

19:17.056 --> 19:19.292
About our fight yesterday...

19:19.326 --> 19:21.160
I'm listening.

19:21.194 --> 19:24.063
Although I hate to admit it,
perhaps I did have

19:24.096 --> 19:26.566
the tiniest case
of stage fright.

19:26.599 --> 19:28.635
But you were better
than me on camera.

19:28.668 --> 19:30.102
Well, thank you.

19:30.136 --> 19:32.505
That's very big of you to say.

19:32.539 --> 19:35.275
I think I probably did so well

19:35.308 --> 19:37.977
because I drank so much water.

19:38.010 --> 19:40.680
I learned that from you.

19:40.713 --> 19:41.748
You really mean that?

19:41.781 --> 19:44.183
Yes, I-I do.

19:46.052 --> 19:47.687
Charlie.

19:47.720 --> 19:49.689
-You're wearing your hat.
-Yeah.

19:49.722 --> 19:52.692
So, I guess you're not, uh,
courting Kathleen anymore?

19:52.725 --> 19:54.761
Did Sid and I screw that up
for you?

19:54.794 --> 19:59.131
Yeah. But I'm just
as much to blame.

20:00.667 --> 20:03.503
Kathleen,
what are you doing here?

20:03.536 --> 20:06.473
Well, I told her
this was all my idea,

20:06.506 --> 20:09.041
and that you never would've lied
if it wasn't for me.

20:09.075 --> 20:10.977
He's-he's a real sweetheart.

20:11.010 --> 20:12.645
KATHLEEN:
I know he is.

20:12.679 --> 20:16.816
I had a feeling you were talking
about your dog in group,

20:16.849 --> 20:18.685
but I didn't want to say
anything in case you really did

20:18.718 --> 20:21.788
have a dead wife named Buttons.

20:21.821 --> 20:25.057
My daddy's name was Marmaduke.

20:28.528 --> 20:32.299
Well, the truth is,
I really like you.

20:32.332 --> 20:34.301
-(chuckles)
-And I'm sorry I lied,

20:34.334 --> 20:38.371
and I'm just, I'm just not good
at this dating thing.

20:38.405 --> 20:41.841
(laughs):
Oh, I'm terrible at it.

20:41.874 --> 20:44.176
That's why I started this
grief group, hoping to meet...

20:44.210 --> 20:46.979
single guys.

20:47.013 --> 20:50.517
Wow! This is great.

20:50.550 --> 20:53.185
You are both super weird.

20:53.219 --> 20:55.788
(laughs) You're gonna have
a lot to talk about.

20:55.822 --> 20:58.491
Maybe you should go for a walk?

20:58.525 --> 21:00.192
That's a fantastic idea.

21:00.226 --> 21:02.495
Okay. I just got
to grab my jacket.

21:02.529 --> 21:05.332
No, no. I got you. Here you go.

21:05.365 --> 21:07.099
Thanks.

21:07.133 --> 21:09.769
Um, Margaret,
can you hang onto this for me?

21:09.802 --> 21:11.604
Go get her, Charlie.

21:11.638 --> 21:14.273
Thank you, Margaret.

21:16.576 --> 21:19.412
Well, it looks like I did it,
boys. (clears throat)

21:19.446 --> 21:22.281
And it, uh, it didn't
even take me a week.

21:22.315 --> 21:25.051
This just in, breaking news,

21:25.084 --> 21:28.888
turns out Margaret isn't a
crappy wingwoman after all.

21:28.921 --> 21:31.223
Questions still remain

21:31.257 --> 21:34.927
as to why she's not helping
these two primo studs

21:34.961 --> 21:37.964
-get a little action.
-(laughs) You guys are too much.
