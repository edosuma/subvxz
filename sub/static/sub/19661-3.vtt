00:02.500 --> 00:04.500
Danny was a scholar, you know?

00:04.510 --> 00:08.440
He was studying for his PHD
in physics.

00:08.440 --> 00:10.610
He had a big future, Mr. stone.

00:11.380 --> 00:13.410
- I know how painful
this must be.

00:13.520 --> 00:16.780
- He had dinner with us
every Sunday night.

00:16.790 --> 00:18.820
The night that he was killed...

00:18.820 --> 00:20.520
- they know all this, honey.

00:20.520 --> 00:22.520
- We usually walked him
to the bus stop.

00:22.530 --> 00:24.690
That night...

00:24.690 --> 00:28.960
I was too tired,
and you had to watch your game.

00:34.540 --> 00:36.840
- Mr. and Mrs. Nasiri,

00:36.840 --> 00:38.740
I'm so sorry about Danny.

00:38.740 --> 00:42.210
- Damn, dude. I just wanted
to tell you I didn't kill him.

00:42.210 --> 00:45.480
- Byron, come on. Let's go.

00:45.480 --> 00:48.780
- Danny didn't do anything
to that boy.

00:48.790 --> 00:50.690
- Except look different.

00:50.690 --> 00:52.950
- I assure you:
Most Americans will not tolerate

00:52.960 --> 00:54.860
the murder of an innocent boy.

00:54.860 --> 00:56.760
- We should go.

01:00.930 --> 01:03.630
- Monday morning,
around 1:45 A.M.,

01:03.630 --> 01:05.600
we found the body
in an abandoned building.

01:05.600 --> 01:08.770
He was already deceased
when we arrived.

01:08.770 --> 01:10.540
- You didn't just happen
by the building, I assume.

01:10.540 --> 01:12.970
- It isn't counsel's place
to assume facts not in evidence.

01:12.980 --> 01:14.840
- Rephrase:
Did you merely happen by

01:14.840 --> 01:15.910
the building on south...

01:15.910 --> 01:17.550
- counsel is leading
the witness.

01:17.550 --> 01:18.850
- And counsel forgets
this is a preliminary hearing,

01:18.850 --> 01:22.080
Rephrase: What brought you
to that abandoned building.

01:22.090 --> 01:26.650
- An anonymous call
from what we later learned was

01:26.660 --> 01:28.720
a tweaker who was squatting
in the building.

01:28.730 --> 01:30.530
- What condition
was Danny Nasiri in

01:30.530 --> 01:31.560
when you found him?

01:31.560 --> 01:34.730
He had been beaten to death
with a tire iron

01:34.730 --> 01:37.000
that we found
in an adjacent dumpster.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.030
- Is this how you found
Danny Nasiri?

01:39.040 --> 01:41.940
- It is.

01:41.940 --> 01:44.640
- And this?
- Yep.

01:44.640 --> 01:46.740
- What initially led you
to suspect the defendant,

01:46.740 --> 01:47.740
Byron Welch?

01:47.740 --> 01:49.080
- We learned from campus police

01:49.080 --> 01:50.780
there had been
a prior altercation

01:50.780 --> 01:52.750
between him and Danny Nasiri.

01:52.750 --> 01:55.620
- And why did you eventually
arrest Byron Welch?

01:55.620 --> 01:57.690
- We found a sweatshirt
that was stained

01:57.690 --> 02:00.660
with what turned out to be
Danny Nasiri's blood.

02:00.660 --> 02:03.790
It had been shoved
into the back of Byron's closet

02:03.790 --> 02:05.130
under his dirty underwear.

02:05.130 --> 02:07.700
Dude, knock it off.

02:08.660 --> 02:10.699
- You think this is
some kind of joke?

02:10.699 --> 02:12.630
Stop.

02:12.640 --> 02:14.340
- How dare you?

02:17.870 --> 02:19.070
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:25.880 --> 02:29.920
- No! Mrs. Nasiri!
- Order!

02:34.920 --> 02:39.360
- Byron Welch, a sophomore
lacrosse player over at CCU,

02:39.360 --> 02:41.130
brutalized
a physics grad student

02:41.130 --> 02:42.800
named Danny Nasiri.

02:42.800 --> 02:44.370
He left him to die
in an abandoned building

02:44.370 --> 02:45.700
on south Kimbark.

02:45.700 --> 02:47.740
- Jealousy, money, or revenge?

02:47.740 --> 02:49.000
- Danny was Muslim.

02:49.010 --> 02:50.370
- Ah.

02:50.370 --> 02:52.670
- Byron must have wiped
the tire iron.

02:52.680 --> 02:54.080
There were no prints on it.

02:54.080 --> 02:56.910
But we did find traces
of Danny's blood.

02:56.910 --> 02:58.980
Oh, it gets better.

02:58.980 --> 03:01.120
This wasn't Byron's
only run-in with Danny.

03:01.120 --> 03:03.350
Six weeks ago, he left
Danny with a bloody nose,

03:03.350 --> 03:05.820
black eyes, and broken ribs.

03:05.820 --> 03:07.150
Danny reported it
to campus police,

03:07.160 --> 03:09.190
but for some reason
withdrew the complaint.

03:09.190 --> 03:11.060
- Aside from that, any motive?

03:11.060 --> 03:13.360
- Cpd checked both
their computers, phone records,

03:13.360 --> 03:14.660
and class schedules.

03:14.660 --> 03:16.100
There wasn't
any obvious connection.

03:16.100 --> 03:18.370
What can I say?
It looks like a garden-variety

03:18.370 --> 03:19.700
hate crime to me,

03:19.700 --> 03:23.370
but stone wants us
to dot all the is.

03:23.370 --> 03:27.710
- Last time I was
at a frat house...

03:27.710 --> 03:29.780
Never mind.

03:29.780 --> 03:33.710
- Come on. You know
you're gonna tell me eventually.

03:33.720 --> 03:36.720
- You do know there's free porn
on the Internet now.

03:36.720 --> 03:39.790
- Whoa, Nagel, I didn't
say anything about porn.

03:39.790 --> 03:41.120
- Mm-hmm.

03:44.060 --> 03:46.160
Oh, stale beer
and something nasty.

03:46.160 --> 03:48.730
That's called hormones.

03:48.730 --> 03:51.200
We're investigators from
the state attorney's office.

03:51.200 --> 03:53.870
- What's that?
Like, better than cops?

03:53.870 --> 03:54.900
- It's, like, different.

03:54.900 --> 03:59.010
- Look, there's no way he killed
that guy. He's a good dude.

03:59.010 --> 04:00.880
- As in he's a good
beer pong partner?

04:00.880 --> 04:04.250
- All right, so, what was
his problem with Danny Nasiri?

04:04.250 --> 04:06.850
- Yeah, why don't we all
just get along? Uh...

04:06.850 --> 04:09.980
- Are you saying Byron
didn't like Muslims?

04:09.990 --> 04:11.250
- You know what the school does

04:11.250 --> 04:13.120
for the towel heads.
- Not now.

04:13.120 --> 04:16.890
I mean, they're part of
the soon-to-be white minority.

04:16.890 --> 04:18.130
- Take another look, pal.

04:18.130 --> 04:20.029
- All Joey's trying to say is

04:20.029 --> 04:21.930
that the school bends over
backwards

04:21.930 --> 04:23.130
for a small group of students...

04:23.130 --> 04:24.870
- they play the damn
call to prayer.

04:24.870 --> 04:29.100
It's like... who's not aware
of Muslims, you know?

04:29.110 --> 04:31.170
- Damn it, Joey.
- So Byron was just

04:31.170 --> 04:32.870
doing the majority a favor?

04:32.880 --> 04:34.710
- Byron didn't even
know the guy.

04:34.710 --> 04:37.980
Look, his brother
was killed in Kabul.

04:37.980 --> 04:39.910
When he beat up Danny,
he was drunk,

04:39.920 --> 04:42.120
and, I don't know,
morose about Bobby.

04:42.120 --> 04:44.850
- Oh, so it could've been
any Muslim?

04:44.850 --> 04:46.720
- Yeah. Wrong time, wrong place.

04:48.720 --> 04:50.830
- Maybe we can see Byron's room.

04:53.730 --> 04:56.800
There's our motive: His brother
getting killed in Afghanistan.

04:56.800 --> 04:59.300
- Yeah, you've seen one Muslim...
- That's not what I meant.

04:59.300 --> 05:02.070
Look, I'm not saying what
those assholes said was right,

05:02.070 --> 05:04.240
but we do seem to go
out of our way

05:04.240 --> 05:06.210
to make them feel comfortable.

05:06.210 --> 05:08.510
- When I was in uniform,
me and McKay,

05:08.510 --> 05:10.980
we would drive past a mosque
every day.

05:10.980 --> 05:13.510
And every day when they saw us,
the people would scatter.

05:13.520 --> 05:17.150
One day,
McKay buys an extra coffee...

05:17.150 --> 05:20.150
He gives the extra cup
to this old dude, Ameer,

05:20.160 --> 05:23.090
before he can get away.

05:23.090 --> 05:27.060
Next day, we drive by... Ameer's
there with a box of donuts.

05:27.060 --> 05:30.970
The day after that,
Ameer brings his wife, Fadi,

05:30.970 --> 05:33.100
and his cousin Saad.

05:33.100 --> 05:35.000
- Donut diplomacy.

05:37.870 --> 05:40.940
Why does Byron have a Koran?

05:40.940 --> 05:42.810
- Maybe he wants
to get to know the enemy.

05:42.810 --> 05:47.250
- "From Addie."
Who is Addie?

05:49.050 --> 05:50.050
You knew Danny?

05:50.050 --> 05:51.890
- He was a good friend.

05:51.890 --> 05:54.020
Actually, I'm the one
who convinced him

05:54.020 --> 05:56.020
to drop his complaint
against Byron.

05:56.030 --> 05:57.790
- Why would you do that?

05:57.790 --> 05:58.990
- Just doing my part in showing

05:59.000 --> 06:01.860
that Islam is a religion
of peace.

06:01.860 --> 06:04.330
Um, I'm a member of
come together.

06:04.330 --> 06:07.000
We promote understanding
between Muslims

06:07.000 --> 06:09.140
and students of other religions.

06:09.140 --> 06:12.170
Byron felt really bad
after he beat up Danny.

06:12.180 --> 06:15.010
He came to a meeting.
That's when I met him.

06:15.010 --> 06:17.140
- And you gave him the Koran?
- I wanted him to see

06:17.150 --> 06:20.380
there's nothing in there
about blowing up westerners.

06:23.050 --> 06:27.320
The truth is I'm sure
Byron didn't kill Danny.

06:27.320 --> 06:29.160
- Because he read the Koran?

06:29.160 --> 06:33.360
- Because he was with me...

06:33.360 --> 06:36.300
All night.

06:36.300 --> 06:38.170
- He's about to go on trial
for murder, Addie.

06:38.170 --> 06:41.000
You didn't maybe think
to tell someone?

06:41.000 --> 06:45.310
- I wanted to, but...

06:45.310 --> 06:47.910
My dad...

06:47.910 --> 06:50.410
He doesn't know
about me and Byron.

06:50.410 --> 06:53.080
- He wouldn't approve?

06:53.080 --> 06:55.420
- My real name is Adara.

06:55.420 --> 06:58.090
It means "virgin."

06:58.090 --> 06:59.990
If he found out...

07:03.330 --> 07:06.190
Byron was only thinking of me.

07:06.200 --> 07:08.330
He made me promise
to keep my mouth shut

07:08.330 --> 07:12.070
unless things turned
really bad for him.

07:12.070 --> 07:14.130
- They have.

07:16.400 --> 07:18.870
- Is there anything else, Addie?

07:30.990 --> 07:33.290
- We made it
the night Danny was killed.

07:48.200 --> 07:52.570
- Proves Byron didn't hate
all Muslims.

07:52.580 --> 07:55.140
It's time stamped 12:30 A.M.
the night Danny was killed.

07:55.140 --> 07:56.380
Before that, he was
with his buddies

07:56.380 --> 07:57.680
from about 9:30 to 11:00.

07:57.680 --> 07:59.680
- And that still leaves a gap
in the timeline.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.380
- So, he commits
a brutal hate crime,

08:01.380 --> 08:03.480
and then makes a sex tape
with his Muslim girlfriend?

08:03.490 --> 08:05.590
- I once convicted a bookie
who cut off his client's arm

08:05.590 --> 08:07.390
and then went to
his daughter's bat Miitzvah.

08:07.390 --> 08:09.290
- That's different.
That's about money.

08:09.290 --> 08:13.130
This is about...

08:13.130 --> 08:15.600
I don't really know
what this is about.

08:15.600 --> 08:17.260
- So find out.

08:21.970 --> 08:23.670
- When I was in school,
I would have six roomies

08:23.670 --> 08:24.970
in a place like this.

08:24.970 --> 08:27.640
- Saturday nights
must have been fun.

08:31.250 --> 08:32.580
- "The Schrodinger equation."

08:32.580 --> 08:34.950
Who writes a whole book
on one equation?

08:36.580 --> 08:38.690
Same filing system I used.

08:40.289 --> 08:43.289
Check this out: It's a receipt
to a local dry cleaner.

08:43.289 --> 08:46.160
Dated three months ago,
addressed to Jafar Boustani.

08:46.160 --> 08:47.560
Maybe Danny did have a roomie.

08:47.560 --> 08:49.460
- Maybe he knows something.

08:52.600 --> 08:55.700
- Danny and I were roommates
for six years.

08:55.710 --> 08:58.340
Admissions put us together
when we were freshmen.

08:58.340 --> 09:01.180
One Muslim's got to get along
with another, right?

09:01.180 --> 09:03.180
- Did you and Danny get along?

09:03.180 --> 09:04.710
- We lived in the dorms
for four years.

09:04.710 --> 09:06.710
And then we got an apartment
off Ellis street

09:06.720 --> 09:08.480
when we started grad school.

09:08.480 --> 09:11.590
- You didn't really answer
the question.

09:11.590 --> 09:15.590
- Yes.
We were great friends.

09:15.590 --> 09:18.030
We're both studying
theoretical physics.

09:18.030 --> 09:20.460
- Like the Schrodinger equation?

09:20.460 --> 09:22.700
- Yeah.

09:22.700 --> 09:24.600
Danny never quite got the hang
of that.

09:24.600 --> 09:26.470
- So, why'd you move out?

09:26.470 --> 09:31.610
- A girl. I moved in with her.
Then we broke up.

09:31.610 --> 09:34.310
I wanted to move back in
with Danny,

09:34.310 --> 09:39.010
but he decided he liked
to live alone.

09:39.020 --> 09:41.480
Now I wish I would've insisted.

09:41.480 --> 09:44.520
- Sorry, but we have to ask:
Where were you...

09:44.520 --> 09:46.520
- the night Danny was killed?

09:46.520 --> 09:50.290
Studying. In the stacks.
Like every night.

09:51.630 --> 09:53.330
You're gonna convict Byron,
right?

09:53.330 --> 09:54.760
- You know Byron Welch?

09:54.760 --> 09:57.600
- I was there the first time
he attacked Danny.

09:57.600 --> 10:00.670
It would've been a lot worse
if I hadn't stopped it.

10:00.670 --> 10:04.540
- Your name wasn't
on the police report.

10:04.540 --> 10:06.440
- I didn't want any trouble.

10:06.440 --> 10:08.340
I mean, you don't know
what it's like on campus.

10:08.340 --> 10:10.740
I don't need enemies.

10:10.750 --> 10:12.750
- Thank you, Jafar.

10:12.750 --> 10:15.720
- Of course.
Anything I can do to help.

10:17.650 --> 10:21.690
- Hey. Your old girlfriend...
What was her name?

10:21.690 --> 10:23.590
- Melanie Burke.

10:26.660 --> 10:28.430
- Have a nice day.
- Yeah.

10:29.830 --> 10:32.070
- You don't believe him?
- No.

10:32.070 --> 10:33.770
There's no way that guy stops
a lacrosse player

10:33.770 --> 10:35.600
like Byron Welch.

10:37.510 --> 10:39.810
- Jafar and I lived together
for maybe a month.

10:39.810 --> 10:41.410
He wasn't a bad guy.

10:41.410 --> 10:43.310
- Not exactly a rave review.

10:43.310 --> 10:46.080
- What do you want me to say?
It didn't last.

10:46.080 --> 10:47.750
- We'd like to know why.

10:47.750 --> 10:50.820
- Why? Jafar was handsome
and he treated me okay,

10:50.820 --> 10:53.650
but... I don't know
the exact word for it...

10:53.660 --> 10:55.620
Insecure, maybe.

10:55.620 --> 10:57.520
Maybe paranoid.

10:57.530 --> 10:59.660
He always felt like the outsider
of the group, you know?

10:59.660 --> 11:01.560
Like everyone hated him.

11:01.560 --> 11:03.460
- Yeah. We met a couple of guys
like that.

11:03.470 --> 11:07.570
- So, you didn't like
the guilt by association?

11:07.570 --> 11:10.370
- I'm dating a guy
from Egypt now.

11:10.370 --> 11:12.110
- Did Jafar ever mention
Danny Nasiri?

11:12.110 --> 11:13.770
- Does all the time count?

11:13.780 --> 11:16.580
He was convinced that Danny was
plagiarizing his research...

11:16.580 --> 11:19.850
Some science stuff
nobody cares about.

11:19.850 --> 11:21.850
Anyway, he said
that if Danny did it again,

11:21.850 --> 11:23.720
he'd hurt him bad.

11:23.720 --> 11:26.350
- You do know
that Danny was murdered?

11:26.360 --> 11:27.650
- Yeah, sure.
- And you never thought.

11:27.660 --> 11:31.390
- What, and be labeled
an Islamaphobe?

11:31.390 --> 11:33.130
Look, I got to get to class.

11:33.130 --> 11:34.760
- Yeah. Thanks.

11:36.660 --> 11:38.670
A fight
between a couple of eggheads?

11:38.670 --> 11:40.770
- As good a motive as any.

11:43.610 --> 11:44.910
- That's your guy Jafar leaving
his building

11:44.910 --> 11:48.410
at 7:37 on the night
Danny was murdered.

11:48.410 --> 11:50.580
He doesn't return until 12:24.

11:53.680 --> 11:56.680
- Put 'em side by side, Ty.

11:56.690 --> 11:58.390
I never took
theoretical physics,

11:58.390 --> 12:00.620
but I doubt it requires
a complete change of clothes.

12:00.620 --> 12:03.190
- But whacking someone
with a tire iron might.

12:03.190 --> 12:06.460
- Damn. Ty, zoom in.

12:06.460 --> 12:08.660
Lower.

12:08.660 --> 12:12.200
The flu game. Jafar changed
everything but his shoes.

12:12.200 --> 12:14.770
- Doesn't prove anything.

12:14.770 --> 12:16.400
Thanks, Ty.

12:17.940 --> 12:20.370
All right, are you kidding me?

12:20.380 --> 12:21.510
- Don't look at me.

12:21.510 --> 12:23.580
You guys eliminated plagiarism
as a motive.

12:23.580 --> 12:25.210
- Yeah, Jafar lied to us.

12:25.210 --> 12:27.580
- And Danny's blood is
on Byron's sweatshirt.

12:27.580 --> 12:30.220
In a case against Jafar,
that is reasonable doubt.

12:30.220 --> 12:31.920
- That blood could've come
from their first fight.

12:31.920 --> 12:33.790
- No way to prove it either way.

12:33.790 --> 12:35.560
I'm not trying
to be difficult here,

12:35.560 --> 12:37.620
but we'll need more
if we're gonna try...

12:37.630 --> 12:40.190
- because Jafar's Muslim?

12:40.200 --> 12:44.630
- Because we already indicted
someone else.

12:44.630 --> 12:46.570
You didn't happen
to find Danny's phone

12:46.570 --> 12:47.670
in his apartment, did you?

12:47.670 --> 12:49.600
It wasn't logged into evidence.

12:49.610 --> 12:50.900
I mean, there might be something
on his phone

12:50.910 --> 12:52.470
that's not on his computer.

12:52.470 --> 12:54.470
- He probably dropped it
when he was attacked,

12:54.480 --> 12:56.210
and we don't know
where that was.

12:57.680 --> 13:00.410
- Find my phone.
- Okay?

13:00.420 --> 13:01.720
- That's the thing
on the computer that tells you

13:01.720 --> 13:04.590
where your phone is.

13:04.590 --> 13:08.460
- Ty? We still have Danny's
computer, don't we?

13:08.460 --> 13:09.990
- Yeah.

13:20.740 --> 13:22.470
- It should be right here.

13:22.470 --> 13:27.740
- Let me see that.

13:27.740 --> 13:30.710
He's right.
We should be standing on it.

13:30.710 --> 13:32.610
- Maybe we are.

13:37.590 --> 13:38.850
Bingo.

13:38.850 --> 13:40.790
- Now all we have to do is
get it.

13:45.830 --> 13:49.800
- That is why
everybody loves a fireman.

13:51.500 --> 13:54.030
- It's dead.
- Yeah, not my department.

13:54.040 --> 13:56.600
- I'll take it
to the communications lab.

13:56.610 --> 13:58.010
Let's separate and canvass.

13:58.010 --> 13:59.770
Somebody might have seen
something.

13:59.780 --> 14:02.280
- Sorry.
- Maybe you heard something

14:02.280 --> 14:05.550
outside.
- Look, I'm sorry.

14:07.520 --> 14:09.020
- Hey, guys,

14:09.020 --> 14:10.950
have you ever seen this man?

14:12.520 --> 14:14.590
- No.

14:14.590 --> 14:17.020
- I heard people shouting,
so I looked out this window,

14:17.030 --> 14:20.490
and there were two boys
fighting.

14:20.500 --> 14:24.560
- Was this one of them?
- Yes. He's handsome.

14:24.570 --> 14:26.630
- You're sure?
It was dark.

14:26.640 --> 14:28.600
- And right under
the street light.

14:28.600 --> 14:31.070
It's so bright
it keeps me up at night.

14:31.070 --> 14:33.940
- Was this the other boy?

14:33.940 --> 14:35.940
- No. I think he was Muslim too.

14:35.940 --> 14:37.080
- So, you got a good look
at him?

14:37.080 --> 14:39.310
- Yes. He was shorter, thinner.

14:39.320 --> 14:40.950
He was wearing a red t-shirt.

14:40.950 --> 14:42.920
He had his hands
around the other one's throat,

14:42.920 --> 14:44.990
shoved him into a car,
and drove off.

14:47.920 --> 14:50.020
Yes. That's him.

14:51.930 --> 14:53.590
- Antiquarks have the same mass
and spin

14:53.600 --> 14:55.900
as their respective quarks.
Excuse me.

14:55.900 --> 14:57.800
- This will just take a minute.

15:01.900 --> 15:04.370
- Stop! Police!

15:05.370 --> 15:06.610
- Hey!

15:08.380 --> 15:10.940
- Jafar!

15:10.950 --> 15:13.910
- Jafar, what are you doing?

15:18.090 --> 15:19.950
- What the hell, dude?

15:19.960 --> 15:21.690
Hey.

15:21.690 --> 15:23.690
Jafar Boustani,
you're under arrest

15:23.690 --> 15:25.060
for the murder of Danny Nasiri.

15:25.060 --> 15:27.060
You have the right
to remain silent.

15:27.060 --> 15:29.030
Anything you say can and will
be used against you

15:29.030 --> 15:30.900
in a court of law.

15:36.770 --> 15:41.740
We think Jafar killed Danny
out of jealousy.

15:41.740 --> 15:43.940
- And Danny's DNA was
on Jafar's shoes.

15:43.950 --> 15:46.950
- "Finally, someone putting
those Muslim..."

15:46.950 --> 15:48.450
I'll skip the next two words,

15:48.450 --> 15:49.750
but they begin with m and f...

15:49.750 --> 15:50.850
"In their place."

15:50.850 --> 15:52.420
- Why do you read that crap,
mark?

15:52.420 --> 15:54.420
- Don't kid yourself.
As goes the Twitter-verse,

15:54.420 --> 15:58.430
- Truth be told, Jafar is
a better defendant than Byron.

15:58.430 --> 16:01.060
- A Muslim?
If you get the right jury.

16:01.060 --> 16:04.430
- All due respect, but I can't
believe what I'm hearing.

16:04.430 --> 16:06.470
- Well, with a jury, there's a
lot more than the law and facts.

16:06.470 --> 16:10.170
- As long as you know that what
you're both saying is...

16:10.170 --> 16:11.440
Well, it starts with an R.

16:11.440 --> 16:12.770
- Republican?

16:12.780 --> 16:15.710
- Racist.

16:15.710 --> 16:18.410
If you don't need me anymore...

16:18.410 --> 16:21.520
- What happened
to the due respect?

16:26.190 --> 16:27.990
- I thought it was a mistake
from the get-go.

16:27.990 --> 16:30.660
No way they had WMD.
I mean, was any of it worth it?

16:30.660 --> 16:34.190
- Thank you. I'll use
a peremptory, your honor.

16:34.200 --> 16:35.730
- You're excused.

16:35.730 --> 16:37.800
- Every Sunday.
Christ chapel of bucktown.

16:37.800 --> 16:39.470
It was my parents' church.

16:39.470 --> 16:41.940
- Do you have children?
- I have a son, Lucas.

16:41.940 --> 16:43.070
He's in college.

16:43.070 --> 16:48.180
- He's a junior at
Liberty university in Virginia.

16:48.180 --> 16:50.480
- Thank you.
She's fine.

16:52.050 --> 16:53.950
- Do you live in a house
or an apartment?

16:53.950 --> 16:56.080
- An apartment.
- Do you own or rent?

16:56.080 --> 16:59.720
- Rent.
- Good for me, your honor.

16:59.720 --> 17:01.760
- Yes, I have two.
A boy and a girl.

17:01.760 --> 17:03.120
- Did they go to college?

17:03.130 --> 17:06.130
- Jennifer went to Northwestern
for two years.

17:06.130 --> 17:07.490
- She didn't like it?

17:07.500 --> 17:08.800
- No... she liked it okay.

17:08.800 --> 17:11.829
She just wanted
to do something important.

17:11.829 --> 17:14.230
- Good for her. What did she do?
- She joined the army.

17:14.240 --> 17:17.040
- And your son?
- He's in the marines.

17:17.040 --> 17:18.970
- Thank you.

17:18.970 --> 17:23.710
- Where'd your boy deploy to?
- He's in the UAE.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.910
- It would be an honor
to have you on the jury, sir.

17:31.250 --> 17:34.820
- Everybody seems to be
in on this but me.

17:34.820 --> 17:36.860
O'Boyle let you
stack the deck with...

17:36.860 --> 17:39.860
- Patriots, Anna.
- I still don't understand

17:39.860 --> 17:41.530
why he'd want jurors
who might be biased

17:41.530 --> 17:43.030
against a Muslim defendant.

17:43.030 --> 17:45.970
- You're forgetting
the victim was Muslim, too.

17:45.970 --> 17:47.870
- I'm good. Mr. stone!

17:47.870 --> 17:49.240
- Oh.
- Honor to be in the courtroom

17:49.240 --> 17:51.270
with you today.
- Thank you, Mr. O'Boyle.

17:51.270 --> 17:55.140
- Call me Billy.
Hell of a case we got, huh?

17:55.140 --> 17:57.010
Between me and you,

17:57.010 --> 17:59.010
I'd just as soon settle
this sucker and call it a day,

17:59.010 --> 18:02.550
but my client... well, you know.

18:02.550 --> 18:04.580
Everybody's innocent.

18:04.590 --> 18:08.020
Well, good luck to you.
And you, miss.

18:08.020 --> 18:10.290
- Thank you.

18:10.290 --> 18:15.260
- Oh, that eyewitness of yours.
The miss...

18:15.260 --> 18:18.100
- Kalila Rafiq.

18:18.100 --> 18:20.570
- The names in this thing are
just killing me.

18:20.570 --> 18:24.270
I noticed she did not testify
at the grand jury.

18:24.270 --> 18:26.770
- She was out of town.

18:26.780 --> 18:30.540
- And yet you still got
an indictment?

18:30.550 --> 18:32.910
Be gentle, Mr. stone.

18:32.920 --> 18:34.580
Be gentle.

18:37.180 --> 18:38.950
- Tell me about Kalila Rafiq.

18:38.950 --> 18:41.050
- We couldn't ask
for a better witness.

18:41.060 --> 18:42.920
She's attractive, articulate,

18:42.930 --> 18:44.990
and she saw the whole thing
go down.

18:47.930 --> 18:49.930
- From the fractures
of the thyroid cartilage

18:49.930 --> 18:52.830
as well as the lack of blood
in his lungs,

18:52.830 --> 18:56.570
I determined that the cause
of death was cerebral anoxia.

18:56.570 --> 18:57.940
Strangulation.

18:57.940 --> 19:00.110
The beating was definitely
postmortem.

19:00.110 --> 19:01.910
- Were there ligature marks?
- No.

19:01.910 --> 19:03.180
No. The victim was strangled
manually,

19:03.180 --> 19:05.080
and that caused him
to empty his bladder.

19:05.080 --> 19:06.950
- And that's what's caused
his DNA to end up

19:06.950 --> 19:08.280
on the soles
of the defendant's shoes?

19:08.280 --> 19:10.350
- That's correct.

19:10.350 --> 19:12.350
- Thank you.

19:14.660 --> 19:17.120
- Dr. Fletcher, are you aware

19:17.130 --> 19:19.890
that Mr. Boustani
and the deceased were roommates?

19:19.900 --> 19:21.160
- No.

19:21.160 --> 19:24.030
- Six long years.
- Objection.

19:24.030 --> 19:27.030
- Withdrawn.

19:27.040 --> 19:28.670
- Do you live with a guy?
- Irrelevant.

19:28.670 --> 19:34.240
And Dr. Fletcher,
I'm sure you have heard of this:

19:34.240 --> 19:39.950
Sometimes a guy...
How do I put this?

19:39.950 --> 19:41.980
A guy will miss the pot
he's trying to pee in.

19:41.980 --> 19:45.390
And when that happens,
and one roommate steps

19:45.390 --> 19:48.190
in the other guy's miscue,

19:48.190 --> 19:51.120
isn't it possible
that roommate B would end up

19:51.130 --> 19:55.000
with DNA from roommate a
on the bottom of his shoes?

19:55.000 --> 19:58.400
- It is possible.

19:58.400 --> 20:02.000
- Was there any blood
on Mr. Boustani's shoes?

20:02.000 --> 20:03.270
- No.

20:03.270 --> 20:04.870
- Well, isn't that odd?

20:04.870 --> 20:07.740
DNA from pee, but no blood.

20:09.880 --> 20:11.340
Nothing further.

20:11.350 --> 20:15.020
- Call your next witness,
Mr. stone.

20:15.020 --> 20:17.150
- The state calls Kalila Rafiq.

20:31.170 --> 20:32.430
- Your honor,
I move that the witness

20:32.430 --> 20:35.200
remove her face covering
before she testifies.

20:35.200 --> 20:37.170
- Please approach.

20:41.310 --> 20:44.210
- The sixth amendment guarantees
the defendant's right

20:44.210 --> 20:46.210
to confront all witnesses
against him.

20:46.210 --> 20:49.120
How is Mr. Boustani supposed
to confront Ms. Rafiq

20:49.120 --> 20:50.280
if he can't see her face?

20:50.290 --> 20:51.420
- The first amendment.

20:51.420 --> 20:53.420
It guarantees everyone...
Even the witness...

20:53.420 --> 20:55.320
The right to practice
his or her religion.

20:55.320 --> 20:56.720
The court cannot force Ms. Rafiq

20:56.730 --> 20:59.090
to do something
her religion forbids.

20:59.090 --> 21:04.030
- She's necessary to your case?
- She's an eyewitness, judge.

21:04.030 --> 21:05.930
- Rock and a hard place.

21:05.930 --> 21:08.070
You can appeal if you like,
Mr. O'Boyle,

21:08.070 --> 21:11.370
but I'm going to allow her
to testify, Niqab and all.

21:11.370 --> 21:14.710
- I was reading in my bedroom
when I thought I heard a scream.

21:14.710 --> 21:17.010
- And what happened then?
- I went to my window.

21:17.010 --> 21:20.380
- And what did you see?
- Two men... boys, really.

21:20.380 --> 21:21.950
They were fighting.

21:21.950 --> 21:25.320
One had his hands
around the other one's neck.

21:25.320 --> 21:28.120
- I show you what has been
marked as people's exhibit 11.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.790
Do you recognize the man
in this photo?

21:29.790 --> 21:32.130
- I do.
- And how do you recognize him?

21:32.130 --> 21:33.990
- He was the man being
strangled.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.460
- And who was strangling him?

21:36.470 --> 21:38.300
- The man sitting there.

21:38.300 --> 21:40.330
- Let the record show
that the witness indicates

21:40.340 --> 21:43.240
the defendant, Jafar Boustani.

21:43.240 --> 21:45.000
What happened then, Ms. Rafiq?

21:45.010 --> 21:46.740
- The man in the photo...
He went limp.

21:46.740 --> 21:49.110
- How limp?
- Like a dead weight.

21:49.110 --> 21:51.750
- Objection as to "dead."
- Sustained.

21:51.750 --> 21:53.780
- What happened after Danny's
body went limp?

21:53.780 --> 21:55.350
- The other man, the defendant...

21:55.350 --> 21:57.120
He pushed him into a car.

21:57.120 --> 21:58.790
- Did Danny resist at all?

21:58.790 --> 22:01.420
- No, sir.
- What happened then?

22:01.420 --> 22:04.160
- The defendant got into
the driver's side of the car.

22:04.160 --> 22:06.790
- Did Danny do anything?

22:06.800 --> 22:08.330
- I could see him
through the car window.

22:08.330 --> 22:11.060
His head fell forward
against the dashboard.

22:11.070 --> 22:12.330
- Thank you, Ms. Rafiq.

22:12.330 --> 22:14.200
I have nothing further.

22:18.410 --> 22:20.140
- Good afternoon, Ms. Rafiq.

22:20.140 --> 22:24.840
Oh, pardon me. Is that
the proper way to address you?

22:24.850 --> 22:28.410
I'm... I am unfamiliar
with your culture.

22:28.420 --> 22:32.020
I've lived in this country
for over 20 years.

22:32.020 --> 22:35.360
- Legally, I presume.
- Yes, I am a citizen.

22:35.360 --> 22:37.560
And I'm married.
You can call me Mrs. Rafiq.

22:37.560 --> 22:40.090
- Oh, well,
you'll have to pardon me.

22:40.100 --> 22:41.430
I couldn't see the ring.

22:41.430 --> 22:43.260
- Is there a question?
- Yes, there is.

22:43.270 --> 22:45.300
As I was saying,
I couldn't see your hands

22:45.300 --> 22:50.200
because your... your...
What... what do you call that?

22:50.210 --> 22:52.370
That's a... a... hijab?

22:52.370 --> 22:54.270
- It's a Niqab, sir.

22:54.280 --> 22:56.810
- Oh, and your husband makes you
wear that, does he?

22:56.810 --> 22:58.440
- It's required by custom.

22:58.450 --> 23:01.250
I mean, if you were to go
to the beach...

23:01.250 --> 23:02.880
- Objection.
- What's the point

23:02.880 --> 23:04.580
you're trying to make,
Mr. O'Boyle?

23:04.590 --> 23:06.250
- I'm getting there, judge.
I promise.

23:06.250 --> 23:08.120
- Do it quickly.

23:08.120 --> 23:12.560
- So, walking to the market
or to the post office...

23:12.560 --> 23:15.130
- Yes.
- Ms. Rafiq, you...

23:15.130 --> 23:16.860
You don't get a lot of sun,
do you?

23:16.870 --> 23:19.900
- I ask the court to admonish
Mr. O'Boyle for making light

23:19.900 --> 23:21.330
of the witness's
religious customs.

23:21.340 --> 23:23.600
- "Making light."
That's very funny, Mr. stone.

23:23.610 --> 23:27.570
That almost the entire body's
intake of vitamin d

23:27.580 --> 23:30.580
comes from direct sunlight?
- No.

23:30.580 --> 23:33.350
- Did you know that women
who wear the full Niqab are

23:33.350 --> 23:35.350
chronically deficient
in vitamin d?

23:35.350 --> 23:37.450
- The witness is not
a medical professional.

23:37.450 --> 23:40.150
- I'll allow it.
- Did you know that a chronic

23:40.160 --> 23:43.160
deficiency in vitamin d leads
to devastating disorders:

23:43.160 --> 23:45.490
Cardiovascular disease, ms,

23:45.490 --> 23:49.260
rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes?

23:49.260 --> 23:51.900
Do you have diabetes, Ms. Rafiq?

23:51.900 --> 23:53.370
- Yes.

23:53.370 --> 23:57.900
- And one of the consequences
of diabetes is

23:57.910 --> 24:00.210
the gradual loss
of one's eyesight.

24:00.210 --> 24:01.610
Isn't that true?

24:01.610 --> 24:04.380
- Yes.
- Hmm.

24:04.380 --> 24:07.350
When did you see
the two men struggling?

24:07.350 --> 24:11.180
- It was around 11:45.
- At night.

24:11.190 --> 24:15.960
- Yes. But there was
a streetlight.

24:15.960 --> 24:19.490
I saw everything that happened,
sir.

24:19.490 --> 24:22.900
- How do you know?

24:22.900 --> 24:24.600
Nothing further.

24:25.930 --> 24:29.270
- Redirect, your honor?
- Go ahead.

24:31.970 --> 24:36.510
- Ms. Rafiq, do you have type 1
or type 2 diabetes?

24:36.510 --> 24:38.380
- Type 1.
- That's also called

24:38.380 --> 24:39.650
juvenile diabetes, isn't it?

24:39.650 --> 24:42.420
- Yes.
- When were you first diagnosed?

24:42.420 --> 24:44.680
- When I was three.

24:44.690 --> 24:46.550
- And when did you start wearing
a Niqab?

24:46.550 --> 24:48.390
- When I was 16.

24:54.190 --> 24:57.600
- Deputy Corcoran, could you
please raise some fingers?

24:59.600 --> 25:02.370
Can you see how many fingers
the deputy has raised?

25:02.370 --> 25:04.500
- Yes. Three.

25:04.510 --> 25:07.440
- And are you wearing contacts
right now?

25:07.440 --> 25:09.380
- No.

25:13.510 --> 25:15.380
- Nothing more.

25:29.630 --> 25:31.560
Torrent downloaded from RARBG.

25:31.570 --> 25:33.530
- You killed it today.

25:33.540 --> 25:36.600
That was the best redirect
I have ever seen.

25:36.600 --> 25:38.000
- In your three years
of practice?

25:38.010 --> 25:40.240
- Seriously.
It was Atticus Finch,

25:40.240 --> 25:42.540
tom cruise kicking the crap
out of Nicholson.

25:42.540 --> 25:44.740
- What if Kalila had
adult onset diabetes?

25:44.750 --> 25:47.550
What if she said the deputy
had two fingers raised?

25:47.550 --> 25:50.020
Hm?

25:50.020 --> 25:53.190
- Never ask a question you don't
already know the answer to.

25:53.190 --> 25:55.020
- I was naked out there.

25:55.020 --> 25:57.990
- I know I screwed up, Peter; I
should've asked if she wore a...

25:57.990 --> 26:00.630
- forget it. Forget it.

26:04.100 --> 26:06.730
You know I played baseball,
right?

26:06.740 --> 26:10.200
It was cubs, Sox, 2007.
Bottom of the ninth.

26:10.210 --> 26:12.570
We're up one.

26:12.570 --> 26:15.140
I throw the sinker, and it's
an easy grounder to third...

26:15.140 --> 26:17.180
A sure double-play
until my third baseman boots it,

26:17.180 --> 26:19.010
and just like that, we lose.

26:19.010 --> 26:20.550
Now, the entire north side
of Chicago...

26:20.550 --> 26:24.720
But the only person I blamed
was myself.

26:24.720 --> 26:27.590
The batter would've
popped it up to right,

26:27.590 --> 26:29.560
and we would've won.

26:35.700 --> 26:38.060
Stone.

26:38.070 --> 26:39.300
You're kidding.

26:39.300 --> 26:41.100
Okay.

26:42.500 --> 26:44.170
- What?
- O'Boyle.

26:44.170 --> 26:45.640
He's putting Jafar on the stand.

26:45.640 --> 26:48.470
- Good.
He'll hang himself.

26:48.480 --> 26:50.210
- Yeah, maybe.

26:51.650 --> 26:55.180
- Six years... we were together
since we were freshmen.

26:55.180 --> 26:56.720
- You were friendly?
- We were.

26:56.720 --> 26:58.790
- And then something happened
to change that?

26:58.790 --> 27:01.820
- Yes.
- And that's why you moved out?

27:01.820 --> 27:03.590
- Yes.

27:03.590 --> 27:07.630
- And why did you move out,
Jafar?

27:07.630 --> 27:10.630
- Danny started watching videos
of Anwar al-awlaki.

27:15.170 --> 27:17.700
- I'm unfamiliar.

27:17.710 --> 27:19.240
- He recruits Americans
to jihad.

27:22.840 --> 27:25.550
- Order.

27:25.550 --> 27:28.850
- Whoa, whoa. So you're saying
that Danny was a terrorist?

27:28.850 --> 27:31.080
- Objection.
- Sustained.

27:31.090 --> 27:33.150
- Well, are you saying
that you actually witnessed him

27:33.150 --> 27:35.250
watching these videos
on his computer?

27:35.260 --> 27:37.790
- No. It was on his cell phone.

27:37.790 --> 27:40.160
- This is ridiculous!
- Order.

27:43.670 --> 27:45.200
- Did you see...
- Tell the truth!

27:45.200 --> 27:47.870
- Order!

27:47.870 --> 27:50.100
- Well, that's the cell phone.

27:50.110 --> 27:53.610
Ah, it's already marked
"people's 23."

27:53.610 --> 27:57.640
- Our technicians weren't able
to access the phone, your honor.

27:57.650 --> 28:00.810
- I know Danny's code.
- Thank you, Jafar.

28:00.820 --> 28:03.820
- Then there is no reason
we shouldn't see what's there.

28:03.820 --> 28:06.720
This is a good time to break.
We'll have a look.

28:12.590 --> 28:15.560
<i>My brothers and sisters...</i>

28:15.560 --> 28:17.560
<i>Come to jihad and feel the honor</i>

28:17.570 --> 28:19.800
<i>and happiness we are feeling.</i>

28:19.800 --> 28:22.300
<i>What prevents you
from attaining martyrdom</i>

28:22.300 --> 28:23.800
<i>and the pleasure of our lord?</i>

28:27.740 --> 28:30.780
- That's the video
you saw Danny watching?

28:30.780 --> 28:32.180
- One of them.

28:32.180 --> 28:34.850
- And how did you react
to those videos?

28:34.850 --> 28:36.880
- I told Danny
he was being crazy.

28:36.890 --> 28:38.820
He wouldn't listen.

28:38.820 --> 28:40.850
He said that Christians have
been oppressing Muslims

28:40.860 --> 28:42.320
for 1,000 years,

28:42.320 --> 28:44.720
and that jihad was
the only weapon the weak had

28:44.730 --> 28:46.390
to conquer the powerful.

28:46.390 --> 28:48.630
- Well, I thought Islam was
a religion of peace.

28:48.630 --> 28:51.900
- Not to Danny.
He quoted the Koran to me.

28:51.900 --> 28:55.330
Sura 47:4.
"So when you meet those

28:55.340 --> 28:57.700
"who disbelieve,
strike their necks

28:57.710 --> 29:00.340
until you have
inflicted slaughter on them."

29:00.340 --> 29:03.940
- Well, that's harsh.
- He took it all out of context.

29:03.950 --> 29:07.710
- So then what happened
when you decided to move out?

29:07.720 --> 29:10.350
- There was something
different about Danny.

29:10.350 --> 29:12.350
One day, he asks me for money.

29:12.350 --> 29:13.790
- What did he want money for?

29:13.790 --> 29:15.760
- He went
to the gardening store.

29:15.760 --> 29:18.690
He bought a 100-pound bag
of fertilizer.

29:18.690 --> 29:19.960
He lives in an apartment.

29:19.960 --> 29:21.660
- What then?

29:21.660 --> 29:23.960
- He went to
several electronics stores.

29:23.970 --> 29:27.770
He bought cell phones, wires,
timers, things like that.

29:27.770 --> 29:32.470
- You thought he was making
an explosive?

29:32.470 --> 29:34.710
- I knew it.

29:37.310 --> 29:39.950
I tried to talk him out of it.

29:39.950 --> 29:42.320
He wouldn't listen.

29:44.380 --> 29:46.920
That's why I killed him.

29:53.460 --> 29:57.360
- Jafar, you... you could've
called the police.

29:57.370 --> 29:59.230
You could've called the FBI.

29:59.230 --> 30:01.700
- And then what?

30:01.700 --> 30:06.270
Why moderate Muslims don't do
anything to stop terrorism.

30:06.270 --> 30:09.240
But when we try,
nobody takes us seriously.

30:09.240 --> 30:11.340
Like the Orlando club.

30:11.350 --> 30:13.950
The FBI knew the shooter
was dangerous.

30:13.950 --> 30:14.950
They knew it.

30:14.950 --> 30:18.280
His first wife told them
as much.

30:18.290 --> 30:20.790
But they did nothing.

30:20.790 --> 30:23.360
They didn't want
to be called bigots.

30:23.360 --> 30:25.730
I did something.

30:25.730 --> 30:29.460
I'm a good American.

30:29.460 --> 30:31.860
I'm a hero.

30:33.770 --> 30:36.700
I am not a criminal.

30:36.700 --> 30:38.800
- Thank you, Jafar.

30:45.880 --> 30:47.850
- Now it looks like
we're prosecuting a damn hero.

30:47.850 --> 30:52.520
- I don't have videos like that
on my cell phone. Do you?

30:52.520 --> 30:55.350
- Danny Nasiri had a good life,
a loving family.

30:55.360 --> 30:57.520
I don't believe a kid like that
would self-radicalize.

30:57.530 --> 31:00.330
- Why do people from Ferguson,
Baltimore, and Milwaukee

31:00.330 --> 31:01.630
burn down
their own neighborhoods?

31:01.630 --> 31:03.360
- I honestly don't know.

31:03.360 --> 31:05.400
- And you never will.

31:05.400 --> 31:06.930
What I want to know is

31:06.930 --> 31:09.640
how Nasiri slipped
under everybody's radar.

31:09.640 --> 31:11.470
- That's the funny thing
about freedom.

31:11.470 --> 31:14.510
It gives our enemies
the freedom to destroy us.

31:17.910 --> 31:20.850
- O'Boyle said Jafar is
not interested in a deal.

31:20.850 --> 31:23.080
- Of course he did.
He suckered you

31:23.080 --> 31:25.420
into picking his damn jury
for him.

31:28.560 --> 31:31.020
- So, you're a good American?
- Yes, sir.

31:31.030 --> 31:32.590
- And a hero?
- That's right.

31:32.590 --> 31:34.590
- Correct me if I'm wrong,
but wouldn't killing Danny

31:34.600 --> 31:37.330
have been sufficient?

31:37.330 --> 31:38.630
- I don't understand.

31:38.630 --> 31:40.400
- Well, you strangled Danny
until he was dead.

31:40.400 --> 31:41.930
That's what the me testified.

31:41.940 --> 31:44.100
And then you dragged him
into an abandoned building

31:44.110 --> 31:47.040
where you beat him...
Well, no, you brutalized him.

31:47.040 --> 31:50.980
Now tell me, Mr. Boustani:
Would a hero do all that

31:50.980 --> 31:54.410
and then try to pin it
on another student?

31:54.420 --> 31:57.950
Well, the answer is no.
Withdrawn.

31:57.950 --> 31:59.950
Does Danny... does he have
a storage locker?

31:59.950 --> 32:01.890
- Not that I know of.
- Did he have a car?

32:01.890 --> 32:04.590
- No.
- Well, that's interesting,

32:04.590 --> 32:07.390
because my investigators have
been to his apartment,

32:07.400 --> 32:10.860
and they, uh, they didn't find
any... any fertilizer,

32:10.870 --> 32:13.030
any cell phones, or any timers.

32:13.030 --> 32:14.600
- I don't hear a question,
your honor.

32:14.600 --> 32:19.140
- What's the fleishman prize,
Mr. Boustani?

32:19.140 --> 32:21.670
- It's an award given out
by the physics department.

32:21.680 --> 32:23.640
- To the best student?
- Yes.

32:23.640 --> 32:25.680
- How many times
have you won it?

32:25.680 --> 32:26.910
- None.

32:26.910 --> 32:29.010
- How many times
did Danny Nasiri win it?

32:29.020 --> 32:30.650
- Four or five.

32:30.650 --> 32:32.150
- Ooh, that must have
pissed you off.

32:32.150 --> 32:35.960
You didn't kill Danny because of
his politics, did you?

32:35.960 --> 32:37.560
You killed him out of jealousy.
Isn't that right?

32:37.560 --> 32:38.960
- No.
- It's difficult, isn't it,

32:38.960 --> 32:40.930
Mr. Boustani, to work, to study,

32:40.930 --> 32:42.630
to dream
of being Albert Einstein,

32:42.630 --> 32:45.100
and then realize
it's never going to happen?

32:48.030 --> 32:49.540
- I've accepted my limitations.

32:49.540 --> 32:52.440
- Yes. But Danny Nasiri,
your friend, your roommate...

32:52.440 --> 32:53.940
He didn't have to.

32:53.940 --> 32:57.040
That would piss me off.

32:59.480 --> 33:02.580
Dan... Danny...

33:05.120 --> 33:08.550
Danny might've been
a better scientist than me.

33:08.560 --> 33:11.120
He might've done
great things someday

33:11.130 --> 33:14.960
that no one in this room
can even imagine.

33:14.960 --> 33:17.500
I admit that.

33:17.500 --> 33:21.070
But what I did, Mr. stone,

33:21.070 --> 33:23.770
when I killed him...

33:23.770 --> 33:27.470
That was the one...
Probably the only...

33:27.480 --> 33:31.080
Great thing that I will ever do.

33:55.170 --> 33:59.170
- I usually love
writing a closing argument.

33:59.170 --> 34:01.210
- Did you ever play
the "would you" game?

34:01.210 --> 34:04.240
"If you could, would you marry
your high school prom date?"

34:04.250 --> 34:06.710
"Would you have
stolen the formula for coke?"

34:06.710 --> 34:08.510
Things like that.

34:08.520 --> 34:12.489
The one sure "yes" is always,

34:12.489 --> 34:15.750
"if you met the baby Hitler,
would you have killed him?"

34:15.760 --> 34:18.560
- It sounds like you approve
of what Jafar did.

34:18.560 --> 34:20.630
- Whatever motivated Jafar,

34:20.630 --> 34:22.600
Danny may well have been
a terrorist.

34:22.600 --> 34:26.830
- Yes, but we'll never know
for sure, will we?

34:26.830 --> 34:30.199
Besides, Jafar's the one
on trial, not Danny.

34:30.199 --> 34:33.139
- Somehow I doubt a jury of
patriots will see it that way.

34:38.040 --> 34:39.580
What?

34:50.159 --> 34:52.659
- Me, I never fought in a war,

34:52.659 --> 34:56.159
but my nephew, Eddie,
he's overseas right now.

34:56.159 --> 34:59.830
Now, we keep in touch
with that Skype thing.

34:59.830 --> 35:03.240
Last month, he gets in touch
with me and he lets me know

35:03.240 --> 35:06.610
that his best buddy over
there... he stepped on an IED,

35:06.610 --> 35:11.580
and he... Blew his legs off.

35:11.580 --> 35:14.750
I started to tell him
just how sorry I was,

35:14.750 --> 35:17.120
but he cut me off.

35:17.120 --> 35:22.090
"No, no, uncle Billy,"
he says, "no.

35:22.090 --> 35:27.160
We do it so you don't have to."

35:27.160 --> 35:31.130
Now, this case,
there's no issue.

35:32.670 --> 35:35.130
He did it.

35:35.140 --> 35:40.710
Jafar... he admitted he killed
Danny Nasiri.

35:40.710 --> 35:45.210
He killed.
He killed to prevent the deaths

35:45.210 --> 35:50.820
of god knows how many
other innocent fellow citizens.

35:50.820 --> 35:53.750
Now, we all hear them tell us,

35:53.750 --> 35:57.290
"if you see something,
say something."

35:57.290 --> 36:01.330
Well, Jafar...
He saw something.

36:01.330 --> 36:05.860
But he took it one step further.

36:05.870 --> 36:07.730
He did something about it.

36:07.740 --> 36:11.640
He did it so you don't have to.

36:13.870 --> 36:15.810
So you don't have to.

36:29.790 --> 36:33.630
- When I selected this jury,
I was being a clever lawyer.

36:33.630 --> 36:36.400
Perhaps too clever by half.

36:36.400 --> 36:39.300
I selected you, ma'am,
because you went to church.

36:39.300 --> 36:43.300
And your son... he's matriculated
at Liberty university.

36:43.300 --> 36:45.670
That's Evangelical,
if I'm not mistaken.

36:45.670 --> 36:46.870
You, sir. You have a son
in the marines

36:46.870 --> 36:48.970
and a daughter in the army.

36:50.980 --> 36:54.810
I selected each one of you
for a very specific reason.

36:54.820 --> 36:57.680
You're patriots.
You believe in god.

36:57.690 --> 37:00.650
You have law enforcement
in the family.

37:00.660 --> 37:04.420
You voted
for the right politician.

37:04.430 --> 37:07.830
At the end of the day,
you're all great Americans.

37:10.800 --> 37:15.700
And I expected you to convict
Jafar Boustani

37:15.700 --> 37:19.440
because of who he is,
not because of what he did.

37:19.440 --> 37:25.810
I forgot that that's not what
great Americans do.

37:25.810 --> 37:29.180
Great Americans look to the law

37:29.180 --> 37:32.280
that binds us together
as a people.

37:32.290 --> 37:34.690
They ignore what their gut
tells them is right,

37:34.690 --> 37:38.220
choosing instead what we
as a civilized society

37:38.230 --> 37:40.730
have collectively determined is
the right thing to do.

37:40.730 --> 37:42.330
Why?

37:42.330 --> 37:47.070
Because that's the only way
a great country stays great.

37:49.470 --> 37:51.400
"Someone had to do something
about Danny Nasiri

37:51.410 --> 37:54.710
before he did something
unspeakable,"

37:54.710 --> 37:56.980
says our guts.

37:56.980 --> 37:59.810
"Someone had to murder him
in cold blood,

37:59.810 --> 38:02.010
"without a trial,
without a verdict,

38:02.020 --> 38:04.380
"without the constitutional
guarantees

38:04.390 --> 38:09.250
"that Mr. O'Boyle's nephew is
risking his life for every day.

38:09.260 --> 38:14.330
That's the right thing to do,"
says our hearts.

38:14.330 --> 38:16.830
But our heads...

38:20.270 --> 38:21.970
All I'm asking of you is
that you continue

38:21.970 --> 38:24.440
to be great Americans...

38:26.870 --> 38:29.270
Continue to be patriots,

38:29.280 --> 38:31.280
continue to fear
whatever god you worship

38:31.280 --> 38:34.050
when you discuss this case
among yourselves,

38:34.050 --> 38:36.280
and you think
of Mr. O'Boyle's nephew

38:36.280 --> 38:40.850
and his buddies
and what they're fighting for

38:40.860 --> 38:44.020
when you discuss this case,

38:44.020 --> 38:48.390
when you determine the guilt
or the innocence

38:48.400 --> 38:50.800
of Jafar Boustani.

39:24.560 --> 39:27.470
- Have you reached a verdict?
- We have.

39:40.580 --> 39:42.510
- In the
people of the state of Illinois

39:42.520 --> 39:44.120
versus Jafar Boustani,

39:44.120 --> 39:46.150
the jury finds the defendant
guilty

39:46.150 --> 39:48.820
of murder in the first degree.

40:07.470 --> 40:10.940
I had a trial tricks professor
who said,

40:10.950 --> 40:12.950
"all good trial lawyers drink,

40:12.950 --> 40:16.980
but the great ones
drink scotch."

40:16.980 --> 40:19.920
- Oh, you are a damn good
trial lawyer, Mr. O'Boyle.

40:19.920 --> 40:22.490
- That "Danny's a terrorist"
thing, you know,

40:22.490 --> 40:27.130
Would never have come up if
the Niqab lady hadn't testified.

40:27.130 --> 40:29.430
- You know what?

40:29.430 --> 40:32.400
The law should be pure,
like physics.

40:32.400 --> 40:35.530
It should be better than media
and politics.

40:35.540 --> 40:37.640
It should exist outside of race.

40:37.640 --> 40:39.540
- Well, if it's any consolation,

40:39.540 --> 40:43.080
when it comes to Muslims,
we're all a tad racist.

40:43.080 --> 40:47.180
Hell, we bend over backwards
trying to avoid confronting it.

40:47.180 --> 40:49.510
- That's a pretty broad
brushstroke.

40:49.520 --> 40:52.020
- It's our nature.

40:52.020 --> 40:55.590
Everybody wants to be tolerant.

40:55.590 --> 40:58.220
A white guy goes into a church
in Charleston,

40:58.230 --> 41:00.960
blows away a black
Bible study class.

41:00.960 --> 41:05.530
What do we do about it?
We ban the confederate flag.

41:05.530 --> 41:09.430
A Muslim murders 49 kids
at a nightclub,

41:09.440 --> 41:12.140
and we admonish each other

41:12.140 --> 41:16.940
not to blame
the entire religion.

41:16.940 --> 41:21.510
We are naturally racist.

41:21.520 --> 41:27.090
But at the same time,
we feel guilty about it.

41:27.090 --> 41:29.620
- Was Danny really a terrorist?

41:29.620 --> 41:34.090
- Well, you mean:
Do I believe my client?

41:34.090 --> 41:35.630
Well, I'm supposed to, right?

41:41.100 --> 41:43.200
- I hated physics.
