WEBVTT

00:04.130 --> 00:06.360
- Abigail Hobbs killed
Nick Boyle.

00:06.400 --> 00:09.267
- We_can tell no one. _
I'm worried about you, WIll.

00:09.310 --> 00:12.199
You empathize so completely
with the killers Jack Crawford

00:12.240 --> 00:16.301
has your mind wrapped around
that you lose yourself to them.

00:16.350 --> 00:18.807
- Maybe I should
get a brain scan.

00:18.850 --> 00:22.388
- Do you feel unstable?
- Is there a problem, Will?

00:22.420 --> 00:24.445
- You lost time.
- There's something wrong

00:24.490 --> 00:26.481
with me.
- I'm your friend, Will.

00:26.520 --> 00:28.613
I don't care about the lives you
save; I care about your life,

00:28.660 --> 00:31.652
and your life is separating
from reality.

00:52.250 --> 00:54.241
(Car alarm chirps.)

00:57.290 --> 01:01.078
(wood creaking)

01:19.340 --> 01:20.705
(She whistles.)

01:20.740 --> 01:22.298
(Bird whistles.)

01:22.350 --> 01:23.840
(She whistles.)

01:23.880 --> 01:25.472
(Bird whistles.)

02:04.890 --> 02:07.688
(thud)

02:07.720 --> 02:10.257
(water dripping)

02:17.330 --> 02:18.866
(She sighs.)

02:18.900 --> 02:20.891
(water dripping)

02:46.660 --> 02:48.924
(draft howling)

03:09.850 --> 03:11.909
(She sighs.)

03:35.840 --> 03:38.400
(water dripping)

04:08.710 --> 04:11.508
(She gasps and screams.)

04:11.550 --> 04:15.008
(stabbing)
(screaming)

04:15.050 --> 04:17.644
- I can feel my nerves

04:17.690 --> 04:20.750
clicking like, uh,
roller coaster cogs,

04:20.790 --> 04:24.624
pulling up to the inevitable
long plunge.

04:24.660 --> 04:26.594
- Quick sounds, quickly ended.

04:26.630 --> 04:30.066
- Abigail Hobbs ended
Nicholas Boyle.

04:30.100 --> 04:31.795
(Nicholas grunts.)

04:31.830 --> 04:33.764
Like a burst balloon.

04:33.800 --> 04:35.597
(Abigail gasping)

04:38.510 --> 04:41.502
She took a life.

04:41.540 --> 04:43.644
- You've taken a life.

04:43.680 --> 04:46.672
- Yeah. Yeah, so have you.

04:48.680 --> 04:51.979
- You're grieving, Will.
Not for the life you have taken,

04:52.020 --> 04:53.988
but for the life that was taken
from you.

04:54.020 --> 04:57.626
If Abigail could have
started over, left the horror

04:57.660 --> 05:00.424
of her father behind,
so could have you.

05:00.460 --> 05:03.588
You could untangle yourself
from the madness and the murder.

05:05.600 --> 05:07.090
- We lied for her.

05:07.140 --> 05:11.099
- We both know the unreality
of taking a life.

05:11.140 --> 05:14.007
The people who die
when we have no other choice,

05:14.040 --> 05:16.941
we know in those moments
they are not flesh,

05:16.980 --> 05:19.107
but light,

05:19.150 --> 05:21.778
and air, and color.

05:21.820 --> 05:25.347
- Isn't that what it is
to be alive?

05:25.390 --> 05:27.415
- Do you feel alive, Will?

05:27.460 --> 05:28.916
- I...

05:28.960 --> 05:31.554
I feel like I'm fading.

05:31.590 --> 05:33.820
- Have you experienced
any further loss of time?

05:33.860 --> 05:35.725
Or hallucinations?

05:41.040 --> 05:43.634
I'd like you to draw
a clock face.

05:43.670 --> 05:45.900
Numbered.

05:45.940 --> 05:49.671
Large hand indicating the hour,
small hand the minute.

05:49.710 --> 05:51.598
- Why?

05:51.650 --> 05:54.369
- An exercise. I want you

05:54.420 --> 05:57.878
to focus on the present moment.
The now. Often as you can,

05:57.920 --> 06:00.115
think of where you are,
and when.

06:00.160 --> 06:02.355
Think of who you are.

06:05.660 --> 06:07.855
- Seven sixteen PM.

06:07.900 --> 06:10.767
I'm in Baltimore, Maryland.

06:13.800 --> 06:17.509
And my name is Will Graham.

06:17.540 --> 06:19.735
- A simple reminder.

06:19.780 --> 06:23.807
The handle to reality
for you to hold on to.

06:23.850 --> 06:26.102
And know you're alive.

06:32.990 --> 06:36.482
***

07:48.530 --> 07:51.727
(Will hyperventilating)

08:02.780 --> 08:04.873
- Will.

08:04.910 --> 08:07.777
(Will panting)

08:44.950 --> 08:46.918
- What happened in there?

08:46.960 --> 08:48.916
- I got confused.

08:48.960 --> 08:50.928
- I've seen you confused
and I've seen you upset,

08:50.960 --> 08:52.723
but I've never seen you afraid
like this.

08:52.760 --> 08:56.093
- Well, I'm an old hand at fear.
I can manage this one.

08:56.130 --> 08:58.223
I just got disoriented.
I can go back in.

08:58.270 --> 09:00.693
- I saw the look on your face
when you came out of that room.

09:00.740 --> 09:03.868
Now, what did you experience
in there that's got you mute

09:03.910 --> 09:05.866
all of a sudden?
- I can see

09:05.910 --> 09:08.879
and hear better afraid.
I-I just can't...

09:08.910 --> 09:11.674
...speak as concisely.
- Will, you

09:11.710 --> 09:14.975
contaminated the crime scene.
You've never done that before.

09:16.990 --> 09:18.639
- I thought I was responsible

09:18.690 --> 09:20.658
for it.
- What are you saying?

09:20.690 --> 09:22.726
You thought that you killed
that woman in there?

09:22.760 --> 09:24.955
- Sometimes with,
uh, what I do--

09:24.990 --> 09:27.925
- What you do is you take
all of the evidence

09:27.960 --> 09:29.769
available at a crime scene.

09:29.800 --> 09:32.667
You extrapolate.
You reconstruct

09:32.700 --> 09:34.930
the thinking of a killer.

09:36.940 --> 09:40.307
You don't think of yourself
as the killer.

09:40.340 --> 09:44.606
- I got lost
in the reconstruction.

09:44.650 --> 09:46.675
Just for a second. Just a blink.

09:46.720 --> 09:49.746
- I know you don't like to be
the cause for concern, but I am

09:49.790 --> 09:52.213
officially concerned about you.
- Officially?

09:52.250 --> 09:55.754
- Yes, that's right.
- Hm.

09:57.760 --> 10:00.126
I thought the reason
you had me seeing

10:00.160 --> 10:03.129
Dr. Lecter and not an FBI
psychiatrist IS

10:03.170 --> 10:06.367
so my mental wellbeing stays...

10:06.400 --> 10:08.368
unofficial.

10:08.400 --> 10:10.231
- I just want
to be careful with you.

10:10.270 --> 10:12.636
We don't want
to break you here.

10:12.680 --> 10:15.934
Is that what's happening?
Have I broken you?

10:15.980 --> 10:18.699
- Do you have anyone

10:18.750 --> 10:22.880
that does this better unbroken
than I do broken?

10:25.690 --> 10:28.011
- Fear makes you rude, Will.

10:31.190 --> 10:33.090
(camera click)

10:35.100 --> 10:37.819
- She drowned
on her own blood.

10:37.870 --> 10:41.033
- And what she didn't drown on
is all over the floor

10:41.070 --> 10:44.164
and under the bed.
She was trying to hide from him.

10:44.210 --> 10:46.929
- He dragged her there. He was
waiting under the bed for her.

10:46.980 --> 10:49.778
- Fought to claw her way out.

10:49.810 --> 10:52.870
- He knew her.
Someone who cared about her,

10:52.920 --> 10:55.969
or thought he did.
- (Bev): He cared too much.

10:56.020 --> 10:58.147
- So, we're looking
for boyfriends, ex-boyfriends,

10:58.190 --> 10:59.851
coworkers,

10:59.890 --> 11:01.949
the guy who bags her groceries.
- I've got a clean

11:01.990 --> 11:04.925
set of prints on the knife
handle. I assume they're yours.

11:04.960 --> 11:08.191
- Sorry.
- Mm.

11:08.230 --> 11:11.119
There's other dermal tissue,
presumably from the killer's,

11:11.170 --> 11:14.333
but the skin is so diseased
or damaged it didn't leave

11:14.370 --> 11:18.136
any useful prints.
- The victim scratched
her killer deep enough to pile

11:18.170 --> 11:21.276
tissue under the fingernails,
but never drew blood.

11:21.310 --> 11:23.699
- Why didn't he bleed?

11:23.750 --> 11:26.275
- After he cut up
the victim's face,

11:26.310 --> 11:30.189
it looks like he was trying
to pull her skin back.

11:30.220 --> 11:32.347
- Like he was removing a mask?

11:36.930 --> 11:38.886
I still have the...

11:38.930 --> 11:41.490
coppery smell of blood
on my hands.

11:41.530 --> 11:43.464
I can't remember seeing

11:43.500 --> 11:46.367
the crime scene before I saw
myself killing her.

11:46.400 --> 11:49.096
- Those memories sank
out of srght,

11:49.140 --> 11:51.062
yet you're aware
of their absence.

11:51.110 --> 11:55.331
- There's a grandiosity
to the violence that I imagined

11:55.380 --> 11:58.349
that feels more real
than what I know is true.

11:58.380 --> 12:01.110
- What do you know to be true?

12:01.150 --> 12:04.142
- I know I didn't kill her.
I couldn't have.

12:04.190 --> 12:08.513
But I remember cutting into her.
I remember watching her die.

12:08.560 --> 12:12.792
- You must overcome
these delusions that_are
dingIsmg your reality.

12:15.260 --> 12:19.026
What kind of savage delusions
does this killer have?

12:19.070 --> 12:22.164
- It wasn't savage.
It was lonely.

12:22.200 --> 12:24.430
It was desperate. Sad.

12:24.470 --> 12:28.509
I caught a glimpse of myself
in the mirror,

12:28.540 --> 12:32.169
and I looked right through me,

12:32.210 --> 12:36.271
past me, as ifI was a...
was just a stranger.

12:36.320 --> 12:40.188
- You have to honestly confront
your limitations

12:40.220 --> 12:42.450
with what you do.
(Will sighs.)

12:42.490 --> 12:44.856
And how it affects you.
- If by limitations

12:44.890 --> 12:49.122
you mean the difference between
sanity and insanity,
I don't accept that.

12:49.160 --> 12:51.560
- What do you accept?
- I know

12:51.600 --> 12:54.967
what kind of crazy I am, and
this isn't that kind of crazy.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.833
This could be... seizures.

12:57.870 --> 13:00.839
This could be a tumor.

13:00.880 --> 13:04.202
A... a blood clot.

13:04.250 --> 13:06.946
- I can recommend
a neurologist.

13:09.080 --> 13:12.345
But if it isn't physiological,
then you have to accept

13:12.390 --> 13:15.484
what you're struggling with
is mental illness.

13:27.870 --> 13:30.065
- You're in very good hands.

13:30.110 --> 13:32.066
Dr. Lecter here is

13:32.110 --> 13:35.375
one of the sanest men I know.
- I would agree.

13:35.410 --> 13:39.005
_Dr. Sutcliffe and I were_
reSIdents together at Hopkins.

13:39.050 --> 13:40.608
- Another life ago,

13:40.650 --> 13:43.118
back when you weren't afraid to
get your hands a little dirty.

13:43.150 --> 13:45.243
- I was always drawn
to how the mind works.

13:45.290 --> 13:48.009
I found it much more dynamic
than how the brain works.

13:48.060 --> 13:52.121
- The projected image is more
interesting than the projector,

13:52.160 --> 13:56.221
until, of course,
the projector breaks down.

13:56.260 --> 13:59.229
So, Will, these headaches.

13:59.270 --> 14:02.535
When did they begin in earnest?

14:02.570 --> 14:04.606
- Two to three months ago.

14:04.640 --> 14:06.938
- About the time
Will went back

14:06.980 --> 14:09.039
into the field,
which is when I met him.

14:09.080 --> 14:11.605
- And the hallucinations?

14:11.650 --> 14:15.177
- I can't really say
when they started.

14:15.220 --> 14:17.188
Um...

14:17.220 --> 14:20.883
I just slowly became aware
that I might not be dreaming.

14:41.610 --> 14:43.578
- (Lecter): It's encephalitis.

14:43.610 --> 14:46.943
- That's your pre-diagnosis?
- Yes.

14:46.980 --> 14:48.413
- Based on...?

14:48.450 --> 14:51.385
- I could smell it.

14:51.420 --> 14:54.912
- So your sense of smell has
gone from calling out
a nurse's perfume

14:54.960 --> 14:57.520
to diagnosing
autoimmune disease.

14:57.560 --> 15:02.429
- He started sleepwalking and
I noticed a very specific scent.

15:02.460 --> 15:05.998
- And what exactly does
encephalitis smell like?

15:06.030 --> 15:08.237
- It has heat.

15:08.270 --> 15:10.067
A fevered sweetness.

15:14.140 --> 15:16.301
- If you suspected,
why didn't you

15:16.340 --> 15:19.548
say something?
- Had to be sure.

15:19.580 --> 15:22.117
Symptoms began slowly

15:22.150 --> 15:25.244
and gradually worsened.
And yesterday,

15:25.290 --> 15:27.281
I asked him to draw a clock.

15:29.290 --> 15:31.281
This is what he drew.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.727
- Oh. Spatial neglect.

15:35.760 --> 15:38.320
Headaches, disorientation,

15:38.370 --> 15:40.565
hallucinations,
altered consciousness.

15:40.600 --> 15:43.467
It's all the telltale signs.
- Hm.

15:43.510 --> 15:47.071
It is so rare to be able to
study the psychological effect

15:47.110 --> 15:50.273
of this type of malady
on a person's mind.

15:50.310 --> 15:52.608
- It's more rare still

15:52.650 --> 15:56.472
to be able to study
the neurological effects.

15:56.520 --> 16:00.183
- A doctor has to weigh
the ultimate benefit
of scientific study.

16:00.220 --> 16:04.224
Even in these times, we know
so little about the brain.

16:04.260 --> 16:06.649
There are great discoveries
to be made.

16:19.740 --> 16:23.244
(loud mechanical whirring)

16:50.740 --> 16:54.232
(woman screaming)

17:07.660 --> 17:12.085
- The right side of his brain is
completely inflamed.

17:12.130 --> 17:14.792
It's anti-NMDA receptor
encephalitis.

17:14.830 --> 17:16.798
The symptoms are only going
to get worse.

17:16.830 --> 17:18.388
- I know.

17:18.430 --> 17:20.398
It's unfortunate for Will.

17:22.400 --> 17:24.402
What do you smell on me?

17:26.410 --> 17:28.139
- Opportunity.

17:36.820 --> 17:39.311
- We didn't find anything
abnormal.

17:39.350 --> 17:41.215
No vascular malformations,

17:41.260 --> 17:42.613
no tumors,

17:42.660 --> 17:44.651
no swelling or bleeding,
no evidence of stroke.

17:44.690 --> 17:46.453
Nothing.

17:46.490 --> 17:49.095
There's nothing wrong with you
neurologically.

17:50.900 --> 17:53.869
- So what I'm experiencing is
psychological.

17:53.900 --> 17:58.360
- Well... brain scans can't

17:58.410 --> 18:01.299
diagnose, uh, mental disorders.

18:01.340 --> 18:04.104
They can only rule out
medical illnesses

18:04.150 --> 18:06.801
like a tumor, which can have
similar symptoms.

18:09.420 --> 18:11.240
Look, we'll run

18:11.290 --> 18:12.746
some more tests.

18:12.790 --> 18:15.714
We'll take some more _
blood samples, but I Imagine

18:15.760 --> 18:19.355
they'll prove to be
just as inconclusive.

18:23.670 --> 18:25.820
- You knew from the moment

18:25.870 --> 18:27.861
you walked into his classroom
that you were putting him

18:27.900 --> 18:30.300
in a potentially destructive
environment.

18:30.340 --> 18:35.300
- I had eight college girls dead
in Minnesota. Will caught
their killer for me.

18:35.340 --> 18:38.639
- He also caught
their killer's disease.

18:38.680 --> 18:41.547
He can't stop thinking
about what it is to take a life.

18:41.580 --> 18:43.889
- I'd rather he go a little mad
than other innocents lose

18:43.920 --> 18:45.911
their lives, and I think
he would feel the same way.

18:45.950 --> 18:48.783
- Will is an innocent.

18:48.820 --> 18:50.788
(Jack sighs.)

18:50.830 --> 18:52.786
- Yes. He is.

18:52.830 --> 18:55.390
I mean, Will is genuine.

18:55.430 --> 18:58.399
He'll survive anything
I could put him through.

18:58.430 --> 19:01.194
He will always fight his way
back to himself.

19:01.240 --> 19:04.459
- Not always. So far.

19:07.310 --> 19:08.868
- He saw

19:08.910 --> 19:11.902
a neurologist today. They found
nothing wrong with him.

19:11.950 --> 19:13.918
He was very upset by that.

19:13.950 --> 19:16.771
- You're saying he wanted
something to be wrong?

19:16.820 --> 19:20.312
- I think he wanted an answer
that wasn't mental illness.

19:20.360 --> 19:23.386
- You think
he's mentally ill.

19:23.430 --> 19:27.696
- The problem Will has is
too many mirror neurons.

19:27.730 --> 19:30.722
Our heads are filled with them
when we are children--

19:30.770 --> 19:33.659
supposed to help us socialize
and then melt away.

19:33.700 --> 19:36.237
But Will held on to his,

19:36.270 --> 19:38.602
which makes knowing who he is
a challenge.

19:38.640 --> 19:41.438
When you take him
to a crime scene, Jack,

19:41.480 --> 19:45.439
the very air has screams
smeared on it.

19:45.480 --> 19:48.813
In those places,
he doesn't just reflect;

19:48.850 --> 19:50.841
he absorbs.

21:21.910 --> 21:24.743
- It's 10:36.

21:24.780 --> 21:28.648
I'm in Greenwood, Delaware.

21:28.680 --> 21:31.478
My name is Will Graham.

21:47.370 --> 21:50.464
(flesh tearing)
(woman crying out)

21:50.510 --> 21:52.535
(Will panting)

22:06.750 --> 22:08.752
It's 1:17 AM.

22:08.790 --> 22:11.429
W-We're in Greenwood, Delaware.

22:11.460 --> 22:13.826
And my name is Will Graham.

22:13.860 --> 22:15.953
And you're alive.

22:16.000 --> 22:18.491
If you can hear me,

22:18.530 --> 22:20.998
you're alive!

22:40.960 --> 22:43.019
- Why did you call me?

22:43.060 --> 22:45.381
Why not Jack?
Why not the police?

22:45.430 --> 22:48.524
- I called you because...

22:48.560 --> 22:52.098
I'm not entirely sure
what I saw was real.

22:57.540 --> 22:59.508
- Then let's prove it.

22:59.540 --> 23:01.098
- I grabbed her arm...

23:01.140 --> 23:02.732
(flesh tearing)

23:02.780 --> 23:04.998
And an entire layer
of dead skin separated

23:05.050 --> 23:07.746
from the underlying tissue,
like she was wearing a glove.

23:07.780 --> 23:11.546
- That's why she doesn't bleed.
- Right. There's no circulation.

23:11.590 --> 23:14.718
And there's nothing alive
in the tissue to bind it.
- What did you do with it?

23:19.730 --> 23:21.459
- I don't know.

23:25.870 --> 23:28.430
- Could be
a staphylococcal infection.

23:28.470 --> 23:31.030
That, or leprosy.
- Her eyes were discolored.

23:31.070 --> 23:33.436
She was, uh, malnourished,
jaundiced.

23:33.480 --> 23:36.779
Her liver was shutting down.
She was...

23:36.810 --> 23:38.698
deranged.

23:40.820 --> 23:44.608
- So she mutilated
a woman's face because
she thought it was a mask.

23:47.720 --> 23:50.086
- She can't see faces.

23:50.120 --> 23:52.452
If she did kill

23:52.490 --> 23:54.799
Beth LeBeau, she might
not even know she did it.

23:54.830 --> 23:58.129
- Then why did she come back?

23:58.170 --> 24:03.130
- To convince
herself she didn't.
- Is that why you came back?

24:07.010 --> 24:09.672
- If I wasn't clear
on that issue,

24:09.710 --> 24:13.578
I know I didn't kill
Beth LeBeau.

24:13.620 --> 24:15.611
I just want to know who did.

24:15.650 --> 24:18.141
- Me too.

24:18.190 --> 24:20.078
- Yeah.

24:22.090 --> 24:24.854
- You're the subject of a lot
of speculation at the bureau.

24:24.890 --> 24:26.983
- Oh, yeah?
What are they speculating?

24:27.030 --> 24:28.850
- That Jack pushed you

24:28.900 --> 24:32.097
right up to the edge, and now
you're pushing yourself over.

24:38.110 --> 24:40.203
- This killer...

24:40.240 --> 24:42.231
can't accept her reality.

24:46.850 --> 24:49.569
I can occasionally identify
with that.

24:51.590 --> 24:54.809
That said, I feel...

24:54.860 --> 24:57.158
relatively sane.

25:07.570 --> 25:10.198
It's 7:05 PM.

25:10.240 --> 25:13.129
I'm in Baltimore, Maryland.

25:13.170 --> 25:16.708
My name is Will Graham.

25:16.740 --> 25:18.879
- Thank you
for humoring me.

25:24.020 --> 25:26.215
- I feel like
I'm seeing a ghost.

25:26.250 --> 25:29.686
- Regarding this killer,
or yourself?
- Both.

25:29.720 --> 25:32.928
- Well, she's real. You know
she's real. There's evidence.

25:32.960 --> 25:35.224
When you found her,

25:35.260 --> 25:38.161
your sanity did not leave you.

25:38.200 --> 25:42.591
- Time did.
- You lost time again?

25:48.840 --> 25:50.979
I spoke to Dr. Sutcliffe.

25:51.010 --> 25:53.149
We briefly discussed
the particulars of your visit.

25:53.180 --> 25:55.148
Would you like to discuss them
with me?

25:55.180 --> 25:58.217
- There are no particulars.
He didn't find anything wrong.

25:58.250 --> 26:00.855
- Then we keep looking
for answers.

26:00.890 --> 26:04.257
Perhaps you would permit me
to run some tests of my own.

26:04.290 --> 26:08.829
- You wouldn't publish anything
about me, would you,

26:08.860 --> 26:12.227
Dr. Lecter?
- If there were ever anything

26:12.270 --> 26:14.738
that might be of therapeutic
value to others,

26:14.770 --> 26:18.160
I'd abstract it in a form _that
would be totally unrecognizable.

26:18.210 --> 26:22.772
- Just do me a favor
and publish it posthumously.

26:22.810 --> 26:25.199
- After your death or mine?

26:25.250 --> 26:28.014
- Whichever comes first.

26:35.260 --> 26:37.683
- Have you considered
Cotard's Syndrome?

26:37.730 --> 26:39.789
It's a rare
delu5ional disorder

26:39.830 --> 26:42.321
in which a person believes
he or she is dead.

26:42.360 --> 26:44.760
- Are you talking
about the killer or me?

26:44.800 --> 26:47.735
- The killer, of course.
- Well, of course. Um,

26:47.770 --> 26:50.364
she couldn't
see the victim's face.

26:50.400 --> 26:53.369
Or she was trying
to uncover it.

26:53.410 --> 26:57.972
- The inability to identify
others is associated
with Cotard.

26:58.010 --> 27:00.103
It's a misfiring
in the areas of the brain

27:00.150 --> 27:03.415
which recognize faces,
and also in the amygdala,

27:03.450 --> 27:05.918
which adds emotion
to those recognitions.

27:05.950 --> 27:10.319
Even those closest to her would
seem like imposters.

27:10.360 --> 27:12.726
- So she... she reached out
to someone she loved,

27:12.760 --> 27:14.853
someone she trusted.

27:14.900 --> 27:18.063
She felt betrayed,
became violent.

27:18.100 --> 27:21.866
- She can't trust anything
or anyone she once knew
to be trustworthy.

27:21.900 --> 27:25.063
Her mental illness won't
let her.

27:35.380 --> 27:38.087
(breathing unsteadily)

27:45.860 --> 27:49.853
(breathing unsteadily)

27:54.870 --> 27:56.997
(breathing unsteadily)

28:05.280 --> 28:07.271
(breathing unsteadily)

28:19.090 --> 28:21.229
- I was almost relieved
when I got that phone call.

28:21.260 --> 28:25.094
I thought that you had found her
and she was, um...

28:25.130 --> 28:27.997
would be at peace.

28:28.040 --> 28:30.429
- You thought she might be dead?
(She giggles.)

28:30.470 --> 28:33.234
- Well, that makes me sound
like a horrible mother.

28:33.270 --> 28:35.500
I tried to be a good mom.

28:35.540 --> 28:37.508
I tried to do everything
that I could.

28:37.540 --> 28:40.748
I just don't want
her to be in pain.
- No one's doubting

28:40.780 --> 28:43.248
your dedication
to your daughter, Mrs. Madchen.

28:43.280 --> 28:46.010
- How well did she know
Beth LeBeau?

28:46.050 --> 28:50.783
- They were best friends.
They went to school together,

28:50.830 --> 28:54.322
um, until it was unsafe
for Georgia to go to school.

28:54.360 --> 28:58.296
- When did you first recognize
that your daughter was

28:58.330 --> 29:00.389
struggling
with mental illness?

29:02.400 --> 29:05.130
- When she was nine
and she told me that she was

29:05.170 --> 29:07.138
thinking about killing me

29:07.170 --> 29:10.298
and said that she was
already dead.

29:10.340 --> 29:13.400
- What sort of symptoms
did she have?

29:13.450 --> 29:16.817
- She had seizures,
hallucinations,

29:16.850 --> 29:19.910
psychotic depression.

29:19.950 --> 29:22.111
I was grateful
when she was catatonic.

29:22.160 --> 29:25.482
(awkward laugh)
- (Jack): Was she ever violent?

29:25.530 --> 29:27.179
- Sometimes.

29:27.230 --> 29:30.028
- What did her doctor say?

29:30.060 --> 29:32.893
- Not much.

29:32.930 --> 29:36.297
She spent months at a time
in the hospital.

29:36.340 --> 29:38.968
Blood tests
and brain scans,

29:39.010 --> 29:42.207
and all of them inconclusive.
They could

29:42.240 --> 29:45.073
never tell me what was wrong.

29:45.110 --> 29:48.045
- And you still don't know?

29:53.490 --> 29:55.583
- They would just say
it was this or it was that.

29:55.620 --> 29:57.349
You know, they were just...

29:59.360 --> 30:01.351
...they were just always
guessing.

30:01.400 --> 30:04.494
And I did my own research.

30:04.530 --> 30:07.863
I wrote down every word
that the doctors said,

30:07.900 --> 30:10.289
the different terminology.
Learned a lot.

30:10.340 --> 30:14.538
But mostly what I learned is,

30:14.580 --> 30:20.849
um, how little is actually known
about mental illness.

30:20.880 --> 30:25.044
All they know, it's rarely
about finding solutions.

30:27.050 --> 30:30.053
It's just more
about managing expectations.

30:50.610 --> 30:53.443
- Managing your expectations?

30:53.480 --> 30:56.119
- Changing my expectations.

30:56.150 --> 31:00.246
You know,
when Miriam Lass died,

31:00.290 --> 31:03.384
I had to come back here
to this office to pack up,

31:03.420 --> 31:05.229
but...

31:05.260 --> 31:08.354
that got to be too overwhelming.
I thought I should just leave,

31:08.400 --> 31:11.119
seeing as how I had gotten
a trainee killed.

31:11.170 --> 31:15.436
That lack of leadership
on my part, that was
my responsibility.

31:15.470 --> 31:18.507
- You didn't kill Miriam Lass;
the Chesapeake Ripper did.

31:18.540 --> 31:22.237
- It didn't feel that way to me.
I pulled her out of a classroom,

31:22.280 --> 31:24.248
like I pulled you
out of a classroom.

31:24.280 --> 31:28.011
- She was a student;
I am a teacher.

31:28.050 --> 31:30.439
- I'm still just as responsible
for you as I was for her.

31:30.480 --> 31:33.586
- I'll take _ __
my own responSIbility.
- Well, not from me you won't.

31:33.620 --> 31:36.509
We can do it together.
I broke the rules

31:36.560 --> 31:39.256
with Miriam. I encouraged her
to break the rules.

31:39.290 --> 31:42.259
I am breaking the rules
with you now.
- By letting

31:42.300 --> 31:45.599
an unstable agent do field work?
- Special agent.
- Oh.

31:45.630 --> 31:48.167
- That means you represent
the FBI. You still represent me.

31:48.200 --> 31:50.236
- Have I misrepresented you,
Jack?

31:52.270 --> 31:55.205
Why are you still here
when the both of us know

31:55.240 --> 31:57.231
that this is bad for you?

31:57.280 --> 31:59.646
- Do you want me to quit?
- No.

31:59.680 --> 32:02.274
No, you had an opportunity
to quit.

32:02.320 --> 32:04.686
You didn't take it.
Why not?

32:04.720 --> 32:08.019
Let me tell you what I think.
I think that the work

32:08.060 --> 32:11.518
you do here has created a sense
of stability for you.

32:11.560 --> 32:13.721
Stability is good
for you, Will.

32:13.760 --> 32:16.092
- Stability requires
strong foundations, Jack.

32:16.130 --> 32:18.598
My moorings are built on sand.
- I'm not sand.

32:18.630 --> 32:22.430
I am bedrock.

32:22.470 --> 32:24.563
When you doubt yourself,

32:24.610 --> 32:27.636
you don't have
to doubt me too.

32:30.740 --> 32:34.039
(Goldberg Variations:
Variation 13, by JS Bach)

32:34.080 --> 32:36.173
- The Jamn Ibrico.

32:36.220 --> 32:38.484
Still love your little rare
treats, don't you, Hannibal?

32:38.520 --> 32:41.455
The more expensive and difficult
they are to obtain, the better.

32:41.490 --> 32:45.358
- It's a distinction that adds
an expectation of quality.

32:45.390 --> 32:47.551
- Not always.
- Well, for Ibrico,

32:47.590 --> 32:51.265
only a few thousand are selected
each year.

32:51.300 --> 32:54.098
But is the pig,

32:54.140 --> 32:57.598
once fattened and slaughtered
and air-cured,

32:57.640 --> 33:00.404
really superior
to any other pig?

33:00.440 --> 33:03.568
Or is it simply
a matter of

33:03.610 --> 33:05.475
reputation preceding product?

33:05.510 --> 33:08.343
- It's irrelevant.

33:08.380 --> 33:11.110
If the _meat-eat_er thinks
it's superior,

33:11.150 --> 33:13.516
then belief determines value.

33:15.520 --> 33:19.729
- A case of psychology
overriding neurology.
- So, we know

33:19.760 --> 33:22.297
how Ibrico gets his pigs.

33:22.330 --> 33:24.469
How did you get yours?

33:27.300 --> 33:29.439
- Are you referring
to Will Graham?

33:29.470 --> 33:33.167
- We know you're fond
of the rarified.

33:33.210 --> 33:35.531
What makes him so rare?

33:39.210 --> 33:44.341
- Will has a remarkably vivid
imagination.

33:44.390 --> 33:46.039
Beautiful.

33:46.090 --> 33:48.581
Pure empathy.

33:48.620 --> 33:53.080
Nothing he can't understand,
and that terrifies him.

33:53.130 --> 33:56.554
- So you set his mind on fire.

33:56.600 --> 34:01.230
- Imagination is an interesting
accelerant for a fever.

34:06.270 --> 34:09.728
- So... how far does this go?

34:09.780 --> 34:11.771
Do you put out the fire,

34:11.810 --> 34:15.109
or do you let him burn?

34:17.120 --> 34:18.849
- Will is my friend.

34:18.890 --> 34:22.257
We will put out the fire
when it's necessary.

34:22.290 --> 34:25.225
- He has asked for more tests.

34:28.360 --> 34:30.419
- Now that we have confirmed
what it is,

34:30.460 --> 34:32.564
it'll be easier to hide
from him.

34:40.570 --> 34:42.572
- You put these in.

34:48.520 --> 34:51.717
This'll be over
before you know it.

35:05.400 --> 35:09.359
(mechanical knocking)

36:33.350 --> 36:35.352
- Dr. Sutcliffe?

36:55.810 --> 36:57.471
- You're clean.

36:57.510 --> 36:59.705
You couldn't have done this
without getting something

36:59.750 --> 37:03.311
on you, and there's nothing
on you.

37:03.350 --> 37:05.989
- I don't feel clean.

37:06.020 --> 37:10.514
- The murder weapon has
the same sort of diseased
or damaged tissues that we found

37:10.560 --> 37:13.324
at Beth LeBeau's house.
- What's this guy got to do

37:13.360 --> 37:15.328
with the other victim?
(Will clears his throat.)

37:15.360 --> 37:16.918
- Just me.

37:16.960 --> 37:18.666
- What do you remember?

37:18.700 --> 37:21.794
- I remember coming here,

37:21.840 --> 37:24.263
going into the MRI,
getting out,

37:24.310 --> 37:27.461
and, uh, finding
Dr. Sutcliffe's body.

37:27.510 --> 37:31.844
- No confusion?
- Well, not that I'm aware of.

37:31.880 --> 37:36.010
- Was your Dr. Sutcliffe
in the habit

37:36.050 --> 37:40.544
of seeing patients afterhours
when he's the only one
in the office?

37:40.590 --> 37:42.911
- He was very accommodating.

37:42.960 --> 37:46.589
- Georgia Madchen
followed you here,

37:46.630 --> 37:49.724
and while you're ticking away
in the MRI,

37:49.760 --> 37:51.967
she does this
to your doctor.

37:52.000 --> 37:55.538
Why him?
- She can't see faces.

37:55.570 --> 37:57.936
Maybe she thought he was me.

37:57.970 --> 38:01.576
- All right, while we're at it,
why you?

38:01.610 --> 38:03.578
- I don't know.

38:03.610 --> 38:06.579
I have a habit
of collecting strays.

38:06.610 --> 38:09.317
I-I-I told her, tried
to tell her the night I saw her,

38:09.350 --> 38:12.513
I tried to tell her she was
alive. Maybe she heard me.

38:16.820 --> 38:19.823
Maybe that hadn't occurred
to her in a while.

38:27.630 --> 38:30.394
(dog growling)

38:30.440 --> 38:32.738
(dog growling)

38:34.740 --> 38:37.402
(growling)

38:37.440 --> 38:39.044
(bark)

38:41.850 --> 38:43.841
(dog growling)

39:02.170 --> 39:04.468
I see you, Georgia.

39:07.110 --> 39:09.829
Think of who you are.

39:15.420 --> 39:16.842
It's midnight.

39:16.880 --> 39:19.678
You're in Wolf Trap, Virginia.

39:19.720 --> 39:22.416
Your name is Georgia Madchen.

39:25.190 --> 39:27.158
You're not alone.

39:27.190 --> 39:29.795
We are here together.

39:33.100 --> 39:35.091
- Am I alive?

40:14.540 --> 40:17.737
- (Jack): She'll recover?

40:17.780 --> 40:20.977
- (Lecter): Risk of infection
is high. She's lost most
of her vital fluids.

40:21.010 --> 40:23.149
Even some bone mass. She's being

40:23.180 --> 40:26.047
treated like a burn victim.

40:26.090 --> 40:28.183
- But she'll recover mentally?

40:28.220 --> 40:31.189
- She has Cotard's Syndrome.
Almost all sufferers

40:31.220 --> 40:33.222
of this delusion recover
with treatment--

40:33.260 --> 40:37.720
in extreme cases like this one,
electroconvulsive therapy.

40:37.760 --> 40:39.990
I'm more concerned about Will.

40:40.030 --> 40:44.808
- I thought you'd be
more concerned about
your colleague, Dr. Sutcliffe.

40:44.840 --> 40:47.161
- I am grieving Dr. Sutcliffe,

40:47.210 --> 40:50.236
but Will is very much alive.

40:50.280 --> 40:53.977
He's still desperate
for an explanation that can
make everything right again.

40:54.010 --> 40:58.071
- I'm, uh, pretty desperate
for some explanations myself.

40:58.120 --> 41:01.214
I really want to talk to this
young woman when she comes to.

41:01.250 --> 41:04.822
How much do you think
she'll remember?

41:04.860 --> 41:08.626
- Well, I sincerely hope,
for her sake, she doesn't
remember much.
