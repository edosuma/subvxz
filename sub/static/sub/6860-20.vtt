00:16.369 --> 00:18.871
Male announcer:
Ahsoka Tano captured!

00:18.939 --> 00:20.973
While on the run to prove her innocence,

00:21.041 --> 00:24.210
Padawan Tano teamed up
with the deadly Asajj Ventress

00:24.277 --> 00:28.180
to find the rogue Jedi
who framed Ahsoka for murder.

00:28.248 --> 00:30.582
The Jedi Council sent Anakin Skywalker

00:30.650 --> 00:33.586
and Master Plo Koon to track Ahsoka down

00:33.654 --> 00:35.754
and bring her back to the Temple.

00:35.822 --> 00:37.556
Now captured and imprisoned,

00:37.624 --> 00:42.294
Ahsoka faces punishment
for crimes she did not commit.

00:42.361 --> 00:45.164
The Senate requests
that Ahsoka Tano be indicted

00:45.232 --> 00:48.067
for acts of treason
against the Republic.

00:48.135 --> 00:51.036
A fair trial Padawan Tano will have

00:51.104 --> 00:53.406
in accordance with Jedi tradition.

00:53.474 --> 00:56.076
Ah, yes, Jedi tradition.

00:56.143 --> 00:57.744
I'm afraid, Master Yoda,

00:57.812 --> 01:01.281
that the Senate believes
that an internal Jedi trial

01:01.349 --> 01:03.517
would seem biased.

01:03.585 --> 01:05.152
Therefore, the Senate asks

01:05.220 --> 01:09.057
that the Council expel
Ahsoka Tano from the Jedi Order

01:09.125 --> 01:11.893
so that she may be put
to a Republic Military tribunal,

01:11.961 --> 01:15.297
where she will receive
more impartial judgment.

01:15.365 --> 01:20.036
And who would represent Ahsoka
in this tribunal, Admiral?

01:20.103 --> 01:22.705
That would be up
to the Council, General,

01:22.773 --> 01:25.875
but I would recommend
someone outside the Order.

01:25.942 --> 01:27.476
Of course.

01:27.544 --> 01:31.080
The Council will act
as they deem necessary.

01:31.148 --> 01:34.784
Thank you, Admiral.

01:34.852 --> 01:37.787
Surely we cannot do
what Tarkin suggests.

01:37.854 --> 01:40.289
We need to stand together with Ahsoka.

01:40.357 --> 01:42.591
And yet there's evidence
that she is indeed

01:42.659 --> 01:45.460
the mastermind behind the attack
on the Temple.

01:45.528 --> 01:50.131
She was found in possession
of nanodroid explosives.

01:50.199 --> 01:52.434
This alone is enough to convict her.

01:52.501 --> 01:55.202
I understand your sentiment,
Obi-Wan,

01:55.270 --> 01:57.805
but if the Council does as you suggest,

01:57.873 --> 01:59.741
it could be seen as an act of opposition

01:59.808 --> 02:01.342
to the Senate.

02:01.410 --> 02:04.879
I'm afraid we have little choice.

02:04.946 --> 02:06.714
Hmm.

02:06.782 --> 02:08.249
To the Chamber of Judgment,

02:08.317 --> 02:10.951
summon Skywalker and his Padawan,

02:11.019 --> 02:14.955
and in our decision,
may the Force guide us.

[groans]

02:32.173 --> 02:33.940
I'm sorry, Snips.

02:34.008 --> 02:36.742
I just--I just don't know
what to do.

02:36.810 --> 02:37.843
It's okay.

02:37.911 --> 02:39.111
I don't either.

02:39.178 --> 02:41.146
[chime resounds]

03:18.148 --> 03:19.683
Padawan Tano,

03:19.750 --> 03:22.986
serious charges
have been levied against you.

03:23.054 --> 03:24.822
How plead you?

03:24.889 --> 03:26.423
Not guilty, Master.

03:26.491 --> 03:29.226
I would never take the lives
of innocents.

03:29.294 --> 03:32.196
The values of the Jedi are sacred to me.

03:32.264 --> 03:34.433
There is evidence to the contrary.

03:34.500 --> 03:36.869
You were alone with
Letta Turmond when she died.

03:36.936 --> 03:38.670
Can you explain this?

03:38.738 --> 03:41.472
Someone used the Force against her.

03:41.540 --> 03:43.174
Which brings us to Ventress.

03:43.242 --> 03:45.677
Can you explain your association
with her?

03:45.744 --> 03:48.646
We had a mutual understanding.

03:48.714 --> 03:50.048
I thought she was helping me.

03:50.115 --> 03:52.083
Did you she help you acquire
the nanodroid weaponry

03:52.151 --> 03:53.518
found when you were apprehended,

03:53.586 --> 03:55.753
the same devices used
in the bombing of the Temple?

03:55.821 --> 03:59.390
No, I was set up and deceived,

03:59.458 --> 04:01.526
as you are being deceived now.

04:01.593 --> 04:03.795
The question is, Padawan Tano,

04:03.862 --> 04:05.830
who is deceiving us?

04:05.898 --> 04:08.299
Ventress, you, or someone else?

04:08.367 --> 04:10.234
I am not deceiving you.

04:10.302 --> 04:12.537
I would assume Ventress is,

04:12.605 --> 04:14.105
but I can't be sure.

04:14.173 --> 04:16.906
My sense is clouded.

04:16.975 --> 04:18.709
Clouded by the dark side

04:18.777 --> 04:20.910
these things are, Padawan Tano.

04:20.978 --> 04:22.812
Dangerously clouded,

04:22.880 --> 04:24.848
but not just surrounding you,

04:24.915 --> 04:27.717
surrounding many things in these times.

04:27.784 --> 04:30.486
You've already made
your decision, haven't you?

04:30.554 --> 04:33.889
This meeting is just a formality!

04:33.956 --> 04:34.890
[sighs]

04:34.957 --> 04:37.326
Reached a decision, we have,

04:37.393 --> 04:40.162
though not in total agreement are we.

04:40.230 --> 04:42.398
It is the Council's opinion

04:42.465 --> 04:44.700
that Padawan Ahsoka Tano
has committed sedition

04:44.768 --> 04:46.168
against the Republic,

04:46.236 --> 04:51.707
and thus, she will be expelled
from the Jedi Order.

04:51.775 --> 04:53.142
You can't do this!

04:53.209 --> 04:56.211
Your Padawan status
will be stripped from you,

04:56.279 --> 04:58.581
and you shall forfeit
all rank and privileges

04:58.648 --> 05:01.350
within the Grand Army of the Republic.

05:01.418 --> 05:03.452
You will be turned over
to the Republic courts

05:03.520 --> 05:04.987
to await your trail

05:05.055 --> 05:07.857
and whatever punishment
they will set for you.

05:07.924 --> 05:12.460
Henceforth, you are barred
from the Jedi Order.

05:20.903 --> 05:22.871
[door whooshes]

05:27.743 --> 05:30.378
PadmÃ© has agreed to represent
you before the Senate.

05:30.446 --> 05:33.782
I will do everything I can
to prove your innocence, Ahsoka.

05:33.849 --> 05:36.184
I am almost certain
that the person behind this

05:36.252 --> 05:37.386
is Ventress,

05:37.453 --> 05:39.889
and you know I wasn't working with her.

05:39.956 --> 05:41.557
She was at the warehouse...

05:41.625 --> 05:42.558
in the room.

05:42.626 --> 05:45.161
We fought, but she got away.

05:45.229 --> 05:49.466
Didn't any of the clones see anything?

05:49.534 --> 05:52.202
No, none of the clones
reported seeing Ventress

05:52.270 --> 05:53.771
at the scene.

05:53.839 --> 05:55.139
I thought you said Ventress left

05:55.207 --> 05:56.907
before you went into the warehouse.

05:56.975 --> 05:58.409
That's what I thought, too,

05:58.476 --> 06:00.845
but then she attacked me
when I got inside.

06:00.912 --> 06:03.447
I'd know her red lightsabers anywhere.

06:03.515 --> 06:07.251
Well, if that's our only lead,
then I know what I have to do.

06:07.319 --> 06:09.287
Wait, where are you going?

06:09.354 --> 06:10.788
You can't leave now.

06:10.856 --> 06:12.990
Yes, I can.

06:13.058 --> 06:17.194
I have to find Ventress
and get to the bottom of this.

06:17.262 --> 06:19.363
Until we hear from Anakin,

06:19.431 --> 06:21.065
let's work on your defense.

06:21.133 --> 06:22.266
[sighs]

06:22.334 --> 06:24.568
Forgive me if I'm not optimistic.

06:24.636 --> 06:27.070
I thought I was part of that Order,

06:27.138 --> 06:30.640
but everyone, except Anakin,
has abandoned me.

06:30.708 --> 06:31.908
I'm not holding out much hope

06:31.976 --> 06:33.877
the Senate will treat me any better.

07:15.300 --> 07:18.435
Anakin Skywalker.

07:18.503 --> 07:20.467
I know you're behind all of this.

07:20.587 --> 07:22.254
Prove it.

07:22.322 --> 07:24.556
[intense orchestral music]

07:24.624 --> 07:27.627
[both grunting]

07:32.065 --> 07:33.966
Leave me alone.

07:34.034 --> 07:35.034
[grunts]

07:43.342 --> 07:46.711
[choking and gagging]

07:46.779 --> 07:48.279
Tell me what happened.

07:48.347 --> 07:49.981
[choking and gasping]

07:50.049 --> 07:52.984
When I heard your little brat
was on the run,

07:53.051 --> 07:55.986
I thought she might bring
a large bounty.

07:56.054 --> 07:57.721
Bounty?

07:57.789 --> 07:59.490
I was going to catch your pet

07:59.558 --> 08:01.892
and turn her over to the authorities,

08:01.960 --> 08:05.697
collect whatever bounty was due.

08:05.765 --> 08:06.765
What stopped you?

08:06.832 --> 08:09.334
[coughing]

08:09.402 --> 08:13.439
At first--I admit--I was
just interested in the money

08:13.507 --> 08:15.775
and a little bit of revenge,

08:15.843 --> 08:19.245
but then I realized
your fallen Padawan and I

08:19.313 --> 08:21.714
had a lot in common.

08:21.782 --> 08:24.785
How dare you compare yourself to Ahsoka?

08:24.852 --> 08:27.153
It's true.

08:27.221 --> 08:30.657
My master abandoned me,

08:30.724 --> 08:35.628
and that's exactly what you did to her,

08:35.696 --> 08:39.465
you and your precious Jedi Order.

08:49.877 --> 08:52.812
[suspenseful orchestral music]

09:12.965 --> 09:15.133
[staff clanging]

09:33.886 --> 09:36.254
Ahsoka Tano,

09:36.322 --> 09:38.390
you have been charged with sedition

09:38.457 --> 09:43.095
against the Jedi Order
and the Republic itself.

09:43.162 --> 09:46.632
This court will decide your fate.

09:46.699 --> 09:50.702
Prosecution, you may begin
your arguments.

09:53.907 --> 09:55.942
Former Padawan Tano,

09:56.009 --> 09:58.644
I shall prove
that you were the mastermind

09:58.712 --> 10:01.481
behind the attack on the Jedi Temple

10:01.549 --> 10:04.484
and that once your accomplices
carried out your orders,

10:04.552 --> 10:07.487
you eliminated them one by one.

10:07.555 --> 10:09.155
When you are found guilty,

10:09.223 --> 10:11.691
I ask the court
that the full extent of the law

10:11.759 --> 10:13.227
be brought down upon you,

10:13.294 --> 10:16.162
including penalty of death.

10:16.230 --> 10:18.665
[dramatic musical flourish]

10:20.201 --> 10:22.336
After I left the warehouse,

10:22.404 --> 10:25.506
after I left your little Padawan alone,

10:25.574 --> 10:26.874
I was walking away,

10:26.942 --> 10:30.044
and I thought she came up
behind me to talk more.

10:30.112 --> 10:31.546
But I was wrong.

10:31.613 --> 10:34.815
Someone came out of nowhere
and hit me from behind.

10:34.883 --> 10:37.952
Not just anyone can sneak up behind me.

10:38.020 --> 10:40.321
It had to be another Jedi.

10:40.388 --> 10:41.689
I don't believe you.

10:41.756 --> 10:43.023
Believe it.

10:43.091 --> 10:46.026
Whoever you're looking for
has my lightsabers.

10:46.093 --> 10:48.194
That's how you'll know
you've found the criminal.

10:48.262 --> 10:49.295
[sighs]

10:49.363 --> 10:51.297
Well, this leads me to a dead end.

10:51.365 --> 10:55.267
You're the only one
Ahsoka had talked to.

10:55.335 --> 10:57.202
That's not true.

10:57.270 --> 10:59.071
What do you mean?

10:59.139 --> 11:01.574
Your Padawan contacted the Temple.

11:01.642 --> 11:05.245
She spoke to someone named Barriss.

11:05.313 --> 11:07.214
That's why we knew
to go to the warehouse

11:07.282 --> 11:08.582
in the first place.

11:08.650 --> 11:12.487
It was this Barriss
that told us to go there.

11:12.554 --> 11:15.323
If you're lying, you're dead.

11:15.391 --> 11:17.558
Such promises.

11:21.263 --> 11:22.963
Look at the facts.

11:23.031 --> 11:25.699
Letta Turmond called Ahsoka to her cell

11:25.766 --> 11:27.834
to reveal the name
of the true mastermind

11:27.902 --> 11:29.736
behind the bombing of the Jedi Temple.

11:29.804 --> 11:32.138
Letta told Ahsoka she was afraid.

11:32.206 --> 11:35.008
She told her the mastermind was a Jedi,

11:35.076 --> 11:37.644
and before she could reveal
the Jedi's name,

11:37.712 --> 11:39.880
Letta Turmond was strangled to death

11:39.948 --> 11:41.482
by way of the Force.

11:41.549 --> 11:44.051
Why would Ahsoka kill Letta

11:44.119 --> 11:46.020
with a method that would so obviously

11:46.088 --> 11:47.889
tie the murder to her?

11:47.957 --> 11:51.092
A Jedi may be responsible
for the murder,

11:51.160 --> 11:54.296
but that Jedi is not Ahsoka Tano.

11:54.363 --> 11:55.864
Members of the court,

11:55.931 --> 11:58.767
you are prosecuting the wrong Jedi.

11:58.834 --> 12:00.702
[clapping slowly]

12:00.769 --> 12:04.172
Well said, Senator Amidala.

12:04.239 --> 12:06.374
However, if she is innocent,

12:06.441 --> 12:09.978
then why was she seen conspiring
with known Separatist terrorist

12:10.045 --> 12:12.380
Asajj Ventress?

12:12.448 --> 12:13.982
Ventress set me up.

12:14.049 --> 12:15.917
My master will prove that.

12:15.985 --> 12:18.153
And where is your master?

12:18.221 --> 12:21.089
He's trying to find the real murderer.

12:21.157 --> 12:25.193
Then maybe he should be looking at you.

12:49.011 --> 12:50.212
[electronic beep]

12:50.279 --> 12:52.981
Enter.

12:53.049 --> 12:56.084
Barriss, I need to talk to you.

12:56.152 --> 12:57.653
Master Skywalker,

12:57.721 --> 12:59.488
how can I help you?

12:59.555 --> 13:01.623
I was told that you spoke with Ahsoka

13:01.691 --> 13:02.958
before she was arrested.

13:03.026 --> 13:04.793
What did you say to her?

13:04.861 --> 13:07.062
We've been friends for a long time.

13:07.130 --> 13:08.964
I was only trying to help her.

13:09.031 --> 13:10.665
I hope I'm not in any trouble.

13:10.733 --> 13:12.200
It's no trouble.

13:12.268 --> 13:14.670
I just need to know what you told her

13:14.737 --> 13:16.138
and if you told anyone else.

13:16.205 --> 13:19.041
No, I thought I had a clue for her,

13:19.108 --> 13:21.009
but I really couldn't tell her anything.

13:21.077 --> 13:22.911
Who told you I spoke to her?

13:22.979 --> 13:24.546
Ventress.

13:24.614 --> 13:26.115
She told me.

13:26.183 --> 13:27.650
Ventress?

13:27.717 --> 13:30.586
Isn't she the one Ahsoka says
is really behind all this?

13:30.654 --> 13:32.322
That's what Ahsoka says,

13:32.390 --> 13:34.591
but I think she's wrong.

13:34.659 --> 13:37.027
Ventress thinks
someone else is involved.

13:37.094 --> 13:38.928
And you believe her?

13:38.996 --> 13:41.331
Who else could it be if not her?

13:41.399 --> 13:42.666
Surely not Ahsoka.

13:42.733 --> 13:46.937
No, I don't think it was Ahsoka either.

13:47.004 --> 13:50.473
I think both Ahsoka and Ventress
are telling the truth,

13:50.541 --> 13:53.710
but there's only one way to find out.

13:55.480 --> 13:59.182
Funny.
Those belong to Ventress.

13:59.250 --> 14:01.451
[lightsabers whooshing, zapping]

14:01.518 --> 14:02.852
You should've gotten rid of them!

14:02.920 --> 14:05.622
I think they suit me.

14:05.689 --> 14:06.856
[yelps]

14:06.924 --> 14:09.225
[intense orchestral music]

14:09.293 --> 14:13.696
I'm sure many of you
look at this former Jedi

14:13.764 --> 14:17.333
and think, "Surely
she cannot be this murderer

14:17.401 --> 14:20.303
or saboteur that they speak of."

14:20.370 --> 14:23.606
And yet think of all the times
we have been fooled

14:23.674 --> 14:25.541
by the Separatists

14:25.609 --> 14:27.744
and how they have infiltrated
the Republic

14:27.812 --> 14:29.946
and ask yourself,

14:30.014 --> 14:34.851
"Is this yet another
Separatist scheme?"

14:34.919 --> 14:37.888
Another way to rip the Jedi,

14:37.956 --> 14:40.825
and subsequently all of us,

14:40.892 --> 14:42.460
apart.

14:45.197 --> 14:47.031
[grunts]

14:47.099 --> 14:50.168
Ahsoka trusted you,
and you betrayed her.

14:50.236 --> 14:51.903
I've learned that trust is overrated.

14:51.971 --> 14:54.172
The only thing
the Jedi Council believes in

14:54.240 --> 14:55.407
is violence.

14:55.475 --> 14:58.410
[lightsabers whooshing, crackling]

15:13.993 --> 15:15.927
Cease hostility!

15:22.568 --> 15:24.303
Barriss!

15:24.371 --> 15:25.971
[glass shattering]

15:26.039 --> 15:27.039
[grunts]

15:27.107 --> 15:29.441
[lightsabers zapping]

15:34.914 --> 15:37.750
[lightsabers zapping]

15:37.817 --> 15:40.819
[screaming and grunting]

15:42.555 --> 15:43.555
Look out!

16:00.240 --> 16:03.242
[lightsabers crackling intensely]

16:04.711 --> 16:05.711
[grunts]

16:07.681 --> 16:10.683
[grunting]

16:17.558 --> 16:18.791
[groans]

16:18.859 --> 16:20.559
[whimpers]

16:24.898 --> 16:29.167
The members of the court
have reached a decision.

16:29.235 --> 16:30.435
[device beeps]

16:38.310 --> 16:40.611
Ahsoka Tano,

16:40.679 --> 16:43.147
by an overwhelming count of--

16:43.215 --> 16:45.649
Chancellor.

16:45.717 --> 16:47.885
I hope you have a reason

16:47.953 --> 16:50.587
for bursting into our proceedings,

16:50.655 --> 16:52.890
Master Skywalker.

16:52.958 --> 16:56.126
I'm here with evidence and a confession

16:56.194 --> 16:58.128
from the person responsible
for all the crimes

16:58.196 --> 17:01.131
Ahsoka has been accused of.

17:01.199 --> 17:05.301
Barriss Offee, member of the Jedi Order

17:05.369 --> 17:06.904
and traitor.

17:12.711 --> 17:15.378
Barriss, is that true?

17:15.446 --> 17:17.381
Tell them the truth.

17:22.053 --> 17:23.819
I did it

17:23.887 --> 17:25.655
because I've come to realize

17:25.723 --> 17:27.190
what many of people in the Republic

17:27.258 --> 17:28.691
have come to realize,

17:28.759 --> 17:31.594
that the Jedi are the ones
responsible for this war,

17:31.661 --> 17:33.329
that we've so lost our way

17:33.396 --> 17:35.798
that we have become villains
in this conflict,

17:35.865 --> 17:38.333
that we are the ones
that should be put on trial,

17:38.401 --> 17:40.502
all of us!

17:40.570 --> 17:42.604
And my attack on the Temple
was an attack

17:42.672 --> 17:45.340
on what the Jedi have become,

17:45.407 --> 17:48.343
an army fighting for the dark side,

17:48.411 --> 17:51.079
fallen from the light
that we once held so dear.

17:51.147 --> 17:54.382
This Republic is failing!

17:54.450 --> 17:57.419
It's only a matter of time.

17:59.255 --> 18:01.890
Take her away.

18:01.958 --> 18:04.894
[melancholy orchestral music]

18:24.647 --> 18:26.581
Ahsoka,

18:26.649 --> 18:29.017
I am so sorry

18:29.085 --> 18:33.322
about everything.

18:33.390 --> 18:35.724
You have our most humble apologies,

18:35.792 --> 18:37.626
little 'Soka.

18:37.694 --> 18:40.729
The Council was wrong to accuse you.

18:40.797 --> 18:44.333
You have shown such
great strength and resilience

18:44.400 --> 18:47.770
in your struggle
to prove your innocence.

18:47.837 --> 18:51.140
This is the true sign of a Jedi Knight.

18:51.207 --> 18:54.110
This was actually your great trial.

18:54.177 --> 18:56.078
Now we see that.

18:56.146 --> 18:58.848
We understand that the Force
works in mysterious ways,

18:58.916 --> 19:00.616
and because of this trial,

19:00.684 --> 19:05.355
you have become a greater Jedi
than you would have otherwise.

19:05.423 --> 19:09.293
Back into the Order you may come.

19:11.196 --> 19:13.864
They're asking you back, Ahsoka.

19:16.568 --> 19:19.737
I'm asking you back.

19:19.805 --> 19:22.739
[dramatic orchestral music]

19:46.931 --> 19:49.265
I'm sorry, Master,

19:49.333 --> 19:51.901
but I'm not coming back.

19:51.969 --> 19:54.904
[melancholy orchestral music]

20:23.634 --> 20:26.903
Ahsoka, wait!

20:26.971 --> 20:29.906
Ahsoka, I need to talk to you.

20:33.978 --> 20:34.912
[sighs]

20:34.979 --> 20:37.781
Why are you doing this?

20:37.849 --> 20:39.984
The Council didn't trust me,

20:40.051 --> 20:42.386
so how can I trust myself?

20:42.454 --> 20:44.121
What about me?

20:44.189 --> 20:46.758
I believed in you.
I stood by you.

20:46.825 --> 20:49.660
I know you believe in me, Anakin,

20:49.728 --> 20:51.863
and I'm grateful for that.

20:51.930 --> 20:54.099
But this isn't about you.

20:54.166 --> 20:57.301
I can't stay here any longer,

20:57.369 --> 20:59.270
not now.

20:59.338 --> 21:01.506
The Jedi Order is your life.

21:01.574 --> 21:04.109
You can't just throw it away like this.

21:04.176 --> 21:07.245
Ahsoka, you are making a mistake.

21:07.313 --> 21:11.450
Maybe, but I have
to sort this out on my own,

21:11.517 --> 21:14.052
without the Council

21:14.120 --> 21:15.920
and without you.

21:18.224 --> 21:19.758
I understand.

21:19.826 --> 21:21.927
More than you realize,

21:21.995 --> 21:26.599
I understand wanting
to walk away from the Order.

21:28.335 --> 21:30.570
I know.
