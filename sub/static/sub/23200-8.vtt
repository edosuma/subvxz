WEBVTT

00:03.545 --> 00:05.088
You really need all this luggage?

00:05.172 --> 00:07.257
You're only going to be gone
for two weeks.

00:07.341 --> 00:09.885
Yes, I intend to make up for lost time.

00:09.968 --> 00:12.262
You know, California, here I come.

00:12.346 --> 00:14.681
"Santa Corona."
What made you decide to go there?

00:14.765 --> 00:18.935
Remember Leslie O'Neill? She worked
downstairs as a supervisor in personnel.

00:19.019 --> 00:21.104
Young, widowed, teenage daughter.

00:21.188 --> 00:23.899
Leslie took a job with
the City of Santa Corona...

00:23.982 --> 00:27.277
and wrote me saying next time I needed
a vacation I should stop by.

00:27.360 --> 00:30.113
I thought you'd be going
someplace really exciting like...

00:30.197 --> 00:32.741
Hawaii, or the Rockies, or the Caribbean.

00:32.824 --> 00:35.076
The reason I'm going
to Santa Corona, Steve...

00:35.160 --> 00:39.247
is that the worst thing that can happen
there is I run out of suntan lotion.

00:44.794 --> 00:47.589
You sign up for
the skateboard competition yet?

00:48.548 --> 00:49.966
Why not?

00:50.050 --> 00:52.552
Me, skateboard in front of 200 people?

00:52.635 --> 00:56.306
More like five judges.
It's only the area elimination.

00:56.931 --> 00:58.641
Remember?

00:59.142 --> 01:02.437
- Remind me to sign up tomorrow, okay?
- That's a deal.

01:02.520 --> 01:04.022
Watch this.

01:06.000 --> 01:12.074

01:27.003 --> 01:28.338
Far out, Jamie.

01:34.969 --> 01:37.972
Lovely design, Mr. Ketchum.
Just a lovely design.

01:38.765 --> 01:41.517
I really admire the beach club.

01:41.851 --> 01:45.021
It's too bad there are so few people
around here to appreciate it.

01:45.104 --> 01:46.689
We do all right.

01:47.315 --> 01:50.860
Come on now, Mr. Ketchum,
we both know the shape this place is in.

01:51.360 --> 01:53.487
You've taken out three loans
in the past year.

01:53.571 --> 01:55.406
Santa Corona's losing money.

01:55.698 --> 01:57.533
That's a sign of sloppy management.

01:57.617 --> 01:59.577
Just what do you want, Mr. Donalsen?

02:00.828 --> 02:03.372
I thought that would be
quite obvious, Mr. Ketchum.

02:04.582 --> 02:06.667
- I want the beach club.
- Oh, yes.

02:06.834 --> 02:09.586
So you can draw in customers
for your gambling operations.

02:09.669 --> 02:13.507
You've a magnificent flair for slander.
I'd be careful with that if I were you.

02:13.591 --> 02:15.176
A man like you could get sued.

02:20.222 --> 02:22.224
No!

02:22.475 --> 02:26.103
What are you doing?
Stop that. Stop that at once!

02:27.229 --> 02:30.900
What are they doing?
That's my daughter's car.

02:31.775 --> 02:33.694
Be glad it's not your daughter.

04:08.663 --> 04:11.624
6:45. We've still got time
for a couple of quick games.

04:11.708 --> 04:13.877
- Sounds good to me.
- All right!

04:28.224 --> 04:29.726
You go first.

04:44.157 --> 04:47.326
- How do you do that?
- Just a knack.

04:50.371 --> 04:52.331
Maybe you should go professional.

04:55.960 --> 04:58.212
- 10,080!
- Wow!

04:59.255 --> 05:01.173
Jamie, check this out.

05:07.096 --> 05:09.849
Oh, brother, this place
is getting too much.

05:11.600 --> 05:14.186
Four big ones, if you please, little lady.

05:27.032 --> 05:28.951
- All right. You try.
- Okay.

05:31.036 --> 05:34.540
Kids, it's 7.00. It's about time
all you troublemakers went home.

05:34.623 --> 05:37.543
You make plenty of money from us.
How come you kick us out?

05:37.626 --> 05:39.837
The old manager let us stay
as long as we wanted.

05:39.920 --> 05:43.299
That's because the old manager
had an IQ above moron level.

05:46.927 --> 05:48.929
What are you doing?

05:49.096 --> 05:51.765
Just checking to see if you leave a trail.

05:56.562 --> 06:00.107
- Howdy, Mr. Friedman.
- Hello there, Mr. Morrisey.

06:00.816 --> 06:02.734
Back for more, huh?

06:03.026 --> 06:05.946
Heck, yes.
You know how I do like my pinball.

06:06.029 --> 06:07.614
Yeah, well, good luck.

06:08.740 --> 06:09.908
Thank you.

06:52.951 --> 06:55.870
Yes, sir, I just love pinball.

06:57.289 --> 07:00.500
You have no idea how much
I've been looking forward to this.

07:00.583 --> 07:04.587
To seeing you and Jamie,
and to just plain relaxing on the beach.

07:04.671 --> 07:08.091
Well, we're glad you finally
decided to take us up on the invite.

07:08.174 --> 07:10.135
Where is Jamie, anyway?

07:10.885 --> 07:13.096
She'll tell you herself in a moment.

07:14.806 --> 07:17.976
- Diana!
- Hey, Jamie!

07:18.059 --> 07:20.603
This is Kevin Wendell. Kevin, Diana Prince.

07:20.687 --> 07:22.981
- Hi!
- Diana's a spy.

07:23.481 --> 07:26.150
Wait a second, Jamie.
I'm a government investigator.

07:26.234 --> 07:28.611
You know, real dull stuff.
Where did she get that?

07:28.695 --> 07:32.657
Mom, I'm going to enter a skateboarding
contest at the Santa Corona Rink.

07:32.740 --> 07:35.451
If I win, I get to go to San Francisco.

07:35.535 --> 07:38.037
Whoa, young lady,
school's not even out yet.

07:38.121 --> 07:40.748
It'll be out tomorrow
and the eliminations are on Friday.

07:40.832 --> 07:43.501
If you're gonna compete
then you have to practice.

07:43.584 --> 07:46.295
Show me a couple of stunts.
I hear you're pretty good.

07:46.379 --> 07:48.172
Good? She's terrific.

07:59.684 --> 08:02.770
- What was the take this week?
- $300,000.

08:02.895 --> 08:04.605
Kind of slow.

08:04.689 --> 08:08.192
Trouble is Santa Corona can't compete
with Vegas or Reno, not yet.

08:08.276 --> 08:10.152
There's not enough nightlife.

08:10.736 --> 08:12.530
Let alone day-life, for that matter.

08:12.613 --> 08:15.491
Don't worry about that
because we've got...

08:15.825 --> 08:17.910
Ketchum's beach club in our pocket.

08:18.995 --> 08:22.665
What I'm interested in now is something
on the order of a convention center.

08:23.666 --> 08:25.334
You've got something in mind?

08:25.418 --> 08:28.546
I do have a thing or two in mind,
Mr. Friedman. Yes, I do.

08:49.650 --> 08:52.361
I'm fine. Thank you.

08:53.153 --> 08:56.365
Diana! How are you?

08:56.740 --> 09:00.411
Schuyler Markham. We worked on
that case about a year ago in LA.

09:00.494 --> 09:02.538
Sure. Did you see that?

09:03.330 --> 09:05.040
Thank you.

09:06.583 --> 09:10.462
Lucky man. Have to have eyes
at the back of your head these days.

09:10.546 --> 09:13.715
- How are you doing?
- I'm fine. Couldn't be better.

09:13.799 --> 09:15.843
I'm off the police force, you know.

09:15.926 --> 09:18.345
Now I'm a freelance security consultant.

09:18.428 --> 09:20.514
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

09:20.597 --> 09:22.891
How about you?
What are you doing in Santa Corona?

09:22.975 --> 09:26.853
I'm here on a vacation.
The first one in about a year.

09:27.688 --> 09:29.690
We should get together soon.

09:29.773 --> 09:32.442
I have to go see a client right now.

09:32.693 --> 09:35.529
- How about lunch tomorrow?
- Okay.

09:35.737 --> 09:39.533
Okay, I'll meet you
at the Pacifica Lounge at noon.

09:39.616 --> 09:42.369
It's right down there at the beach. Okay?

09:42.869 --> 09:45.372
- Great, Skye. Nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.

09:49.292 --> 09:52.087
Someone better do something
about the crazy drivers in this town...

09:52.170 --> 09:54.089
before someone gets hurt.

09:54.172 --> 09:56.925
If anyone can do something about it,
you can.

09:57.175 --> 09:59.844
Frankly, your threats are getting tedious.

09:59.970 --> 10:02.264
Does that mean
you're considering my offer...

10:02.347 --> 10:04.432
to buy these deserted storefronts
from you?

10:04.516 --> 10:08.436
I intend to renovate them and
preserve a part of Santa Corona's past.

10:08.770 --> 10:12.524
I won't see them torn down
for some antiseptic convention center.

10:12.607 --> 10:15.902
Just as I won't see you turn
Santa Corona into another Atlantic City.

10:15.985 --> 10:19.697
John, you really seem rather
upset about this near-accident.

10:20.323 --> 10:23.201
Maybe you and I better discuss this
another time.

10:24.119 --> 10:27.413
But please be careful
because you never know about accidents.

10:28.581 --> 10:30.166
Take care.

10:36.923 --> 10:39.133
Mr. Key is going to be stubborn about this.

10:41.469 --> 10:43.429
Do you know that gray building...

10:43.513 --> 10:46.641
in the middle of the storefronts
that are so dear to his heart?

10:46.724 --> 10:48.810
It's a real fire hazard, that building.

10:51.104 --> 10:52.438
But...

10:53.147 --> 10:56.776
perhaps Mr. Key will reconsider my offer...

10:58.111 --> 11:00.404
once that property is beyond renovation.

12:16.271 --> 12:17.481
Yes.

12:17.564 --> 12:20.234
Mr. Donalsen, may I see you for a minute
in private?

12:20.317 --> 12:21.902
Come in.

12:25.781 --> 12:29.076
We seem to have a problem.
Her name is Diana Prince.

12:30.410 --> 12:33.413
Do you think the Prince woman
is investigating us?

12:33.705 --> 12:35.749
I don't know. She says she's on vacation.

12:35.832 --> 12:39.378
But between you and me, she doesn't
seem the type that's ever on vacation.

12:39.461 --> 12:42.255
Maybe she's the reason
why our little bonfire...

12:43.882 --> 12:45.634
just fizzled.

12:46.093 --> 12:47.761
Could be.

12:48.386 --> 12:51.181
I don't know how that fire went out.

12:51.515 --> 12:55.227
But fortunately, the police
don't know who started it.

12:56.770 --> 12:58.980
I'll just have our men take care of her.

12:59.064 --> 13:01.525
No, Evan, not just yet.

13:01.900 --> 13:05.278
We really don't know if she's
actually looking into our operations.

13:05.362 --> 13:07.572
I've arranged
to have lunch with her tomorrow.

13:07.656 --> 13:09.824
I'll try and find out more then.

13:09.908 --> 13:13.453
You'd better, because the last thing
we need on our back is the IADC.

13:13.745 --> 13:15.121
Right.

13:19.459 --> 13:22.962
Mr. Morrisey, I'm afraid that your credit...

13:23.046 --> 13:25.673
has just reached its limits.
That'll be your last round.

13:25.757 --> 13:28.343
Hey, man, I'm not doing that bad.

13:28.426 --> 13:31.805
Let's put it this way. If this was
a hospital instead of a casino...

13:31.888 --> 13:34.682
you would have
just died at the operating table.

13:34.766 --> 13:37.060
Duane Morrisey always pays his debts.

13:37.143 --> 13:40.063
I'll have my bank in Austin
wire me money to cover this.

13:40.146 --> 13:43.233
You do that tomorrow morning.
Right now, you have to say goodbye.

13:43.316 --> 13:45.985
I got this system and it works.

13:46.069 --> 13:49.489
I just need a little more time,
a couple of more minutes.

13:49.739 --> 13:52.300
That was a terrific lunch, Skye, thank you.

13:52.335 --> 13:53.697
Good.

13:53.732 --> 13:55.995
You can show your gratitude
by telling me...

13:56.079 --> 13:58.664
what you're really doing
here in Santa Corona.

13:58.748 --> 14:00.833
I told you before. It's just a vacation.

14:00.917 --> 14:05.338
Oh, sure. I suppose you were
seduced by our travel brochures:

14:05.546 --> 14:07.965
"Leisure Capital Of The West. "

14:08.049 --> 14:11.511
I have a couple of friends,
and I thought it would be a perfect place...

14:11.594 --> 14:13.930
to have a nice quiet vacation.

14:14.013 --> 14:16.349
But with all the weird goings-on
around here...

14:16.432 --> 14:18.267
I might have to revise my estimate.

14:19.602 --> 14:21.312
What do you mean?

14:21.437 --> 14:24.315
Well, like that arson attempt
I read about in the paper.

14:24.398 --> 14:28.027
You have any idea why someone would
want to burn down an empty building?

14:28.486 --> 14:32.323
Probably just a couple of screwy kids.
Cheap thrills.

14:32.782 --> 14:35.493
And here I thought I'd be
getting away from all that.

14:35.659 --> 14:39.497
- You will. Tell you what I'm gonna do.
- What?

14:39.663 --> 14:43.083
I'll use all the pull I have to make sure
that the rest of your stay...

14:43.167 --> 14:45.294
is as boring as possible.

14:45.377 --> 14:48.839
I don't know about boring.
How about just uneventful?

14:49.256 --> 14:51.008
Done.

15:06.357 --> 15:08.525
- Do you mind?
- Sorry.

15:08.609 --> 15:10.652
You're pretty good at that, little lady.

15:10.736 --> 15:13.489
Almost good enough to
give me a run for my money.

15:14.364 --> 15:17.868
How about trying a game?
Say, a penny a point?

15:18.160 --> 15:21.205
Why don't you make it $1 a point
and I'll give you a break.

15:21.497 --> 15:25.125
- I won't make you pay up.
- Pretty cocky, aren't you, little lady?

15:25.375 --> 15:27.294
Let's try.

16:03.580 --> 16:05.123
You're on.

16:33.234 --> 16:34.736
Let's see.

16:34.861 --> 16:38.615
8,200 minus 450.

16:38.740 --> 16:40.783
At $1 a point, you would've owed me...

16:40.867 --> 16:43.745
$7,750.

16:43.828 --> 16:46.122
Even at a penny a point you'd be hurting.

16:46.581 --> 16:48.625
How'd you get so good at this?

16:49.042 --> 16:50.919
Just a knack, I guess.

16:52.462 --> 16:54.714
You got some kind of system, don't you?

16:54.797 --> 16:57.967
For Pete's sake.
I just memorize the speed of the ships...

16:58.051 --> 17:00.803
calculate the time it takes
for a torpedo to intercept...

17:00.887 --> 17:05.183
take into account the speed of the torpedo
and the drift of the sea mines, and fire.

17:08.644 --> 17:11.646
- How much is 12 times 12?
-144.

17:11.731 --> 17:14.650
-12 times 19?
-228.

17:15.067 --> 17:19.070
-19 times 36?
-684.

17:21.031 --> 17:24.327
How many ships were on the screen
in the game we just played?

17:25.453 --> 17:28.455
- Sixty-two.
- How many did I sink?

17:28.581 --> 17:29.957
Seven.

17:31.375 --> 17:34.503
You got one of them
photographic memories, don't you?

17:34.587 --> 17:37.548
I mean, you're a... What do you call it?

17:37.631 --> 17:39.675
A lightning calculator.

17:40.342 --> 17:44.180
It's just something I do.
I never gave it that much thought.

17:46.807 --> 17:49.226
You know something, sweetheart...

17:49.769 --> 17:52.521
you remind me so much of my daughter.

17:55.774 --> 17:58.235
- Poor thing.
- Thanks a lot.

17:58.319 --> 18:02.239
What I mean to say is, she's in for
some hard times, unless I could...

18:03.490 --> 18:06.702
Maybe you, with that memory
of yours, maybe you could...

18:11.915 --> 18:13.292
What?

18:14.209 --> 18:17.087
Maybe you could, with that wondrous...

18:17.171 --> 18:19.465
God-given talent you've got...

18:19.548 --> 18:22.009
right a terrible wrong that's been done.

18:22.885 --> 18:25.429
You think you could be so kind...

18:26.054 --> 18:28.724
so merciful as to do that thing?

18:29.224 --> 18:31.560
Sure, I guess.

18:31.643 --> 18:34.605
Bless you, child. Bless you.

18:35.063 --> 18:36.857
I hate to admit it, Evan...

18:36.940 --> 18:40.068
but that girl's here on assignment.
I'd stake my reputation on it.

18:41.570 --> 18:45.574
In that case, I think we better
arrange a permanent vacation for the lady.

18:45.949 --> 18:47.784
As soon as possible.

19:09.472 --> 19:11.349
- Hi!
- Hi.

19:11.433 --> 19:12.934
Now, tell the truth.

19:13.018 --> 19:17.355
Wouldn't you rather be splashing around
in the blue Pacific, than reading this book.

19:17.439 --> 19:19.858
Well, no. Not really.

19:19.941 --> 19:22.861
Sure she would.
Let's help the little lady save herself.

19:22.944 --> 19:24.279
My glasses!

19:24.362 --> 19:26.948
Go with the flow, baby.

19:45.175 --> 19:48.636
Listen, a joke's a joke,
but aren't we getting in a little deep?

19:48.720 --> 19:51.014
Not as deep as we're gonna get, lady.

20:44.984 --> 20:47.903
Talk. Who told you to kill Diana Prince?

20:47.987 --> 20:51.282
Donalsen, Evan Donalsen.

20:51.615 --> 20:53.909
- Why?
- I don't know.

20:54.034 --> 20:56.328
You don't ask questions.

21:04.169 --> 21:05.838
Are you Mr. Key?

21:05.921 --> 21:08.966
Yes, I'm John Edward Key.
I'm on the city council.

21:09.049 --> 21:11.510
The police phoned me
after you filed your complaint...

21:11.594 --> 21:13.762
against the two men
who tried to drown you.

21:13.846 --> 21:17.224
Key? You're the one
whose building was set on fire?

21:17.308 --> 21:20.019
Yes, I'd like to talk to you about that.

21:20.185 --> 21:24.690
I believe the man responsible for that
was behind the attempt on your life.

21:25.107 --> 21:27.359
Evan Donalsen.

21:28.152 --> 21:31.155
I think we both best keep on the move.

21:31.864 --> 21:35.534
Donalsen is an elusive
and dangerous man.

21:35.701 --> 21:39.621
His threats are implicit,
his actions anonymous.

21:40.163 --> 21:42.332
There are rumors he has all sorts of...

21:42.416 --> 21:45.043
illegal gambling operations around town.

21:45.168 --> 21:48.005
So far we haven't a shred of hard evidence
against him.

21:48.088 --> 21:51.216
Unfortunately, what Wonder Woman
got from those two hoods...

21:51.300 --> 21:53.719
isn't considered hard evidence.

21:54.344 --> 21:58.265
Testimony by magic lasso
isn't exactly admissible in court.

21:58.348 --> 22:01.059
But at least we know
that Donalsen is behind it.

22:01.184 --> 22:03.812
Obviously he knows you're with the IADC.

22:03.895 --> 22:06.606
Maybe he sees you as some kind of threat.

22:06.898 --> 22:09.985
Ms. Prince, if something isn't done...

22:10.068 --> 22:13.363
Donalsen is going to buy
Santa Corona right out from under us...

22:13.446 --> 22:16.825
and turn it into another nest
of criminals and gamblers.

22:16.992 --> 22:19.202
We need your expertise.

22:19.494 --> 22:22.831
And insomuch as you already
seem to be one of his targets...

22:23.081 --> 22:26.626
- What can I lose by helping out, right?
- Right.

22:28.753 --> 22:33.049
Well, so much for this vacation.
Maybe I can call my boss at IADC...

22:33.133 --> 22:35.677
and he can give us
a little information on Mr. Donalsen.

22:35.760 --> 22:37.679
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

22:37.762 --> 22:40.557
We can call from my office. It's not far.

22:43.059 --> 22:44.936
The object of blackjack...

22:45.019 --> 22:47.939
is to get as close to 21 points
without exceeding it.

22:48.273 --> 22:52.110
Kings, queens, jacks, and tens
all count for 10 points.

22:52.277 --> 22:55.113
All other cards are face value
except for the ace.

22:56.281 --> 22:58.449
You sure do have
one heck of a memory, gal.

23:00.201 --> 23:02.954
We should get that money back
in no time at all.

23:03.454 --> 23:06.916
I shouldn't be too much trouble
getting you in, as mature as you are.

23:07.166 --> 23:09.544
And what with wearing the clothes
I'm gonna get you.

23:09.627 --> 23:12.505
Shoot, you could probably pass for 22, 23.

23:13.673 --> 23:17.719
- Where is this place, anyway?
- You'll know that soon enough, honey.

23:19.095 --> 23:22.140
I'm taking a mighty big chance
just sneaking you in.

23:23.057 --> 23:26.811
It's either that
or a slow ride down the Pecos River.

23:27.353 --> 23:30.231
Okay, but remember,
two hours and that's it.

23:31.941 --> 23:35.861
If these guys are crooks who gypped
you out of your daughter's trust fund...

23:35.945 --> 23:37.655
Cross my heart.

23:37.863 --> 23:40.658
Then I guess it's okay
to hustle the money back.

23:41.993 --> 23:45.079
But I have to be home by 11:00
or my mom will have a fit.

23:45.496 --> 23:48.082
Don't worry your pretty little head
about that, honey.

23:48.165 --> 23:50.918
Two hours should just about
be all it should take.

23:52.712 --> 23:56.799
Donalsen's done this sort of thing
in other cities, only on a smaller scale.

23:56.882 --> 23:59.510
He'll come in
and buy a nightclub or a hotel...

23:59.593 --> 24:02.096
and lay the foundation
for his illegal activities.

24:02.179 --> 24:03.931
Where does he get the funds?

24:04.598 --> 24:06.308
Syndicate money, mostly.

24:06.475 --> 24:08.310
That's what makes it so difficult.

24:08.394 --> 24:11.772
With the mob backing him, he can
cover his tracks before we can move.

24:11.855 --> 24:14.942
And since the mob is involved,
we're involved, Diana.

24:15.025 --> 24:19.196
- Which means-
- I know, so much for my vacation.

24:19.613 --> 24:22.408
Any idea what Donalsen's next move
will be?

24:23.367 --> 24:26.078
Seeing as he's gained control
of an arcade...

24:26.161 --> 24:27.871
a nightclub and a dinner theater...

24:27.955 --> 24:31.041
Ira believes he'll try for
some kind of recreation center...

24:31.125 --> 24:33.001
to draw a wealthy clientele.

24:33.752 --> 24:37.464
There's the Santa Corona Beach Club.
It's not doing too well.

24:37.589 --> 24:40.092
Howard Ketchum
might be persuaded to sell out to him.

24:40.175 --> 24:42.845
That's our lead then Steve.
Thanks for the information.

24:42.928 --> 24:45.639
Anytime, Diana. And about your vacation...

24:45.722 --> 24:47.099
I'm sorry.

24:47.182 --> 24:49.518
You are? Bye.

24:55.232 --> 24:58.819
They finally got here, did they?
Thank you. Thank you very much.

24:58.902 --> 25:01.738
They took there own sweet time.

25:02.197 --> 25:04.658
- What's that?
- Some books I ordered from back east.

25:04.741 --> 25:07.035
- I thought they'd never get here.
- Hold it.

25:07.369 --> 25:09.579
That was a private
delivery service, wasn't it?

25:09.663 --> 25:10.956
Yes.

25:11.873 --> 25:15.252
Then why is there postage
on this package?

25:17.295 --> 25:18.880
Let's get out of here.

25:26.221 --> 25:28.807
To think I could've
gone to Lake Tahoe instead.

25:28.890 --> 25:30.433
Donalsen must be pretty desperate...

25:30.517 --> 25:33.103
planting a bomb
in a public building like that.

25:33.186 --> 25:35.480
I have the feeling
it's not going to be too safe...

25:35.563 --> 25:37.857
being around either one of us for...

25:38.483 --> 25:40.944
- Oh, no.
- What?

25:44.489 --> 25:46.616
I'm sorry I had to move out.

25:46.783 --> 25:49.786
I wouldn't have done it
if it weren't for your own good.

25:49.869 --> 25:51.788
But who is it? Who's after you?

25:51.871 --> 25:53.790
I can't tell you that. The more you know...

25:53.873 --> 25:55.708
the greater danger you'll be in.

25:55.792 --> 25:58.711
- We'll miss you, Diana.
- I'll miss you, too, Jamie.

25:59.170 --> 26:01.464
If either of you need me...

26:01.548 --> 26:04.634
I'll be at the Beachside Motel,
near the Coast Highway.

26:04.759 --> 26:07.053
Call me. Don't come in person.

26:07.178 --> 26:09.722
- Bye, Diana.
- Okay, bye.

26:09.806 --> 26:11.349
I love you both.

26:17.855 --> 26:19.816
I'm sure you'll find everything in order.

26:19.899 --> 26:23.486
Mr. Donalsen is very good
when it comes to contracts.

26:24.153 --> 26:26.072
Give me a minute, will you, please?

26:26.197 --> 26:29.951
It's not every day a man sells something
it took him 20 years to build.

26:33.246 --> 26:35.164
I said no interruptions, Ms. Horne.

26:35.248 --> 26:39.460
My name, Mr. Ketchum, is Diana Prince.
I'm with the IADC.

26:43.673 --> 26:47.176
I said no interruptions. No exceptions.

26:49.178 --> 26:51.722
If I have to, I'll have you subpoenaed.

26:53.474 --> 26:57.353
Then I suggest you do so, Ms. Prince.
Good afternoon.

26:58.479 --> 27:01.190
Tell Mr. Ketchum I will be back.

28:09.758 --> 28:11.510
Afternoon, Mr. Ketchum.

28:11.635 --> 28:15.430
Diana Prince had trouble reaching you,
so she asked me to keep her appointment.

28:15.514 --> 28:18.934
What are you doing in here?
This is a private office. Get out at once.

28:19.017 --> 28:21.103
Not until we have a little chat.

28:21.186 --> 28:23.438
I don't chat with intruders.

28:28.318 --> 28:29.653
All right.

28:31.196 --> 28:34.241
- What did you want to talk about?
- Evan Donalsen.

28:34.616 --> 28:37.994
- I'd rather not discuss it.
- He's gotten to you already?

28:38.078 --> 28:40.538
No one has gotten to me.
You didn't hear me say that.

28:40.622 --> 28:42.666
Unless someone stands up to this man...

28:42.749 --> 28:45.502
he'll buy the whole town
before you know what's happened.

28:45.585 --> 28:48.671
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I think you do.

29:02.185 --> 29:04.103
You, I take it, work for Donalsen.

29:04.187 --> 29:06.523
If she grabs me, Ketchum,
your family's dead!

29:06.606 --> 29:08.858
Wonder Woman, please, don't.

29:09.359 --> 29:11.027
Call her off, Ketchum.

29:11.861 --> 29:14.364
- I can't let him go.
- You have to.

29:15.698 --> 29:19.619
If I don't play along with them,
if I don't sell them my beach club...

29:19.702 --> 29:22.538
my wife, my daughter
will be in a terrible danger.

29:22.997 --> 29:26.584
All right. Why don't you crawl
back under your rock and leave?

29:26.667 --> 29:29.337
Next time we meet,
it'll be on neutral ground.

29:29.420 --> 29:31.297
There are no neutral grounds, lady.

30:00.326 --> 30:01.744
I feel like a jerk.

30:01.827 --> 30:04.622
Nonsense. You look like
one of them pretty ladies on TV.

30:05.039 --> 30:07.625
I don't think Farrah Fawcett
is losing any sleep.

30:10.377 --> 30:14.340
All you got to do is remember
what cards are still left in the deck...

30:14.465 --> 30:17.927
and compute the odds on whether
or not I should take another card.

30:18.010 --> 30:20.721
I understand. But what are we doing here?

30:24.058 --> 30:25.643
Watch.

30:32.900 --> 30:35.944
- Far out.
- Ma'am.

30:52.127 --> 30:55.464
Here you go. That ought to cover
that little debt I owe you.

30:58.800 --> 31:02.221
So it does. Well, enjoy your evening.

31:02.304 --> 31:04.806
- I hope you have a little better luck.
- Thank you.

31:07.976 --> 31:10.812
- Where'd you get the money?
- Out of my loan shark.

31:10.896 --> 31:13.273
Two hundred percent interest,
but it's all worth it.

31:13.357 --> 31:15.150
Because tonight I'll win it all back.

31:15.233 --> 31:16.443
And then some.

31:41.843 --> 31:43.178
Hit me.

31:47.432 --> 31:49.225
Twenty-one, you beat that.

31:50.185 --> 31:53.188
Duane, can't we leave now?

31:53.605 --> 31:56.107
Leave now? We just got here.

31:56.649 --> 31:58.359
Just a couple of more hands.

31:58.526 --> 32:02.739
I want to see the look on Friedman's face
when I break his bank.

32:05.867 --> 32:08.286
She lead some kind of
a charmed existence or what?

32:08.369 --> 32:11.080
No, she doesn't lead
a charmed existence at all.

32:11.247 --> 32:13.875
She just happens to be a very good agent.

32:14.042 --> 32:17.337
I've seen her in operation.
She's resourceful and tenacious.

32:17.420 --> 32:20.048
It'll take more than a couple of hoods
to put her away.

32:21.758 --> 32:24.052
Perhaps you're right. Perhaps...

32:24.636 --> 32:27.722
someone should do the job that she trusts.

32:28.389 --> 32:29.891
Wait a minute, Evan...

32:29.974 --> 32:33.061
when I took this job,
you didn't say anything about murder.

32:35.730 --> 32:39.150
That was just an oversight on my part,
that's all.

32:43.321 --> 32:46.741
I hired you as my security consultant.

32:47.575 --> 32:50.244
When will you
start making me feel secure?

32:58.127 --> 33:01.005
I'm sitting this one out.
I have to go to the ladies' room.

33:01.088 --> 33:02.965
Sure, honey, you go ahead.

33:03.591 --> 33:06.594
Just don't bet more than
$100 while I'm gone.

33:07.345 --> 33:11.432
Don't worry about me. I'm an old hand
at this. I know what I'm doing.

33:14.643 --> 33:18.814
Hey, my man, what do you say
we do it the way we do it in Texas?

33:19.773 --> 33:21.108
Double or nothing.

33:45.507 --> 33:49.303
If you take a look at her dossier,
you'll realize that she's deep in debt.

33:52.681 --> 33:55.100
- Who was that?
- I didn't get a good look at her.

33:55.309 --> 33:57.478
Whoever she was, she sure got an eyeful.

34:04.860 --> 34:07.654
What happened?
Where are all your winnings?

34:07.905 --> 34:11.116
It's not as bad as it looks.
I still got a few chips left.

34:11.617 --> 34:14.244
We can build up again what we lost.
It won't take long.

34:14.328 --> 34:18.290
It's after midnight. I'm not going to
stay here for another five hours.

34:18.790 --> 34:21.168
Duane, how could you do this?

34:21.585 --> 34:24.463
- What are you going to tell your daughter?
- What daughter?

34:26.797 --> 34:28.632
Oh, my daughter.

34:29.509 --> 34:34.347
- You creep. You lousy creep!
- There's no reason to talk like that.

34:34.431 --> 34:38.185
I'm going home. And as for you,
know where you can go, turkey.

34:51.656 --> 34:53.992
That's the girl that was in the office.

34:54.074 --> 34:56.244
She came with that hick, Morrisey.

34:56.328 --> 35:00.123
The rhinestone cowboy won't leave
until we find out where she lives.

35:07.505 --> 35:08.923
Hello?

35:10.049 --> 35:11.551
Hi, Skye.

35:12.218 --> 35:14.596
No, I had to get up
to answer the phone anyway.

35:16.055 --> 35:17.640
Yes, I know it's an old joke.

35:17.724 --> 35:20.602
What do you expect
at 1:00 in the morning?

35:24.022 --> 35:26.649
Well, sure, Skye, if it's important.

35:27.233 --> 35:30.903
Come on over.
I'll be dressed in a couple minutes, okay?

35:32.947 --> 35:34.490
Bye.

35:44.876 --> 35:46.419
Just a second.

35:48.337 --> 35:51.215
Jamie! What are you doing here?
Come on in.

35:51.382 --> 35:54.260
What's that dress you're wearing?
Where have you been?

35:54.343 --> 35:57.972
Would you believe watching this guy
play blackjack for five and a half hours?

35:58.389 --> 36:00.600
It was a stupid thing to do, Diana, but...

36:00.683 --> 36:04.103
I was helping this guy
'cause he lost all his money to this casino.

36:04.228 --> 36:05.605
Casino? Where?

36:05.688 --> 36:08.316
You're not going to believe this,
but there's a casino...

36:08.399 --> 36:11.277
in back of the electronic arcade
near the beach.

36:11.569 --> 36:13.654
What a weird place for a casino.

36:13.738 --> 36:17.032
Come on, we're going to
the police station. Put this jacket on.

36:17.116 --> 36:20.369
I knew it. I'm gonna get seven to ten
in the state slammer, right?

36:20.453 --> 36:22.663
No, you're going to be a heroine.

36:23.330 --> 36:25.416
Skye, I'm sorry, I forgot.

36:25.499 --> 36:27.626
We'll have to make that meeting
some other time.

36:27.710 --> 36:28.752
Why? What's up?

36:28.836 --> 36:32.381
I think we have the evidence
we need to convict Evan Donalsen.

36:32.715 --> 36:34.133
- You have?
- Yes.

36:34.216 --> 36:36.802
There's a casino in the rear of the arcade.

36:37.177 --> 36:39.346
Diana, I really think
I should call my mother.

36:39.430 --> 36:42.433
We'll call her from police station
while we wait for the warrant.

36:42.516 --> 36:44.685
- I'll see you tomorrow, Skye.
- Sure, Diana.

36:50.315 --> 36:53.527
I really don't know what you think
you're looking for, gentlemen...

36:53.610 --> 36:56.071
and ladies. But it's your warrant.

36:56.238 --> 37:00.284
- The door to the casino was right there.
- That door goes to the storage room.

37:00.701 --> 37:02.953
- That's all.
- Do you mind, Mr. Friedman?

37:04.204 --> 37:05.831
No, come on.

37:31.231 --> 37:35.527
- Satisfied?
- But it was here. I'm positive.

37:36.319 --> 37:38.363
The casino was right here.

37:48.874 --> 37:51.251
If this kid does have
a photographic memory...

37:51.334 --> 37:53.587
she'll have a complete map
of our operations.

37:53.670 --> 37:55.338
I put some feelers out.

37:55.422 --> 37:58.967
She's entered in a skateboarding
contest down at the Santa Corona Rink.

37:59.050 --> 38:00.885
Then grab her after the contest.

38:04.639 --> 38:07.726
As for the Prince job,
I want you to finish it immediately.

38:07.809 --> 38:09.936
All right, you don't have to tell me twice.

38:10.061 --> 38:13.731
That's true. I've told you that before,
and I'm not going to tell you again.

38:17.527 --> 38:19.279
I can't understand it.

38:19.362 --> 38:21.948
How could Donalsen have known
what we were going to do...

38:22.031 --> 38:24.450
when the only ones who knew
were you, me, and Jamie.

38:24.534 --> 38:26.786
Maybe he bribed the judge
who gave us the warrant.

38:26.870 --> 38:28.788
I wouldn't put anything past him.

38:30.748 --> 38:33.209
- Yes, Ms. Steele?
- Schuyler Markham for Ms. Prince.

38:33.293 --> 38:35.378
It's for you. Schuyler Markham?

38:39.132 --> 38:42.010
Of course.
Diana, how could you be so dumb?

38:42.093 --> 38:44.011
- What is it?
- Schuyler Markham...

38:44.220 --> 38:46.806
arrived just as Jamie and I were leaving.

38:46.889 --> 38:49.559
I told him
I'd found something on Donalsen.

38:49.642 --> 38:51.686
And I mentioned the arcade.

38:51.811 --> 38:53.729
Then he might be our man.

38:54.272 --> 38:57.483
- Shall I put him on?
- Absolutely.

39:00.528 --> 39:03.614
Hello, Skye. Sorry about last night.

39:03.823 --> 39:07.660
Don't sweat it. But I still would
like to see you, it's fairly urgent.

39:07.827 --> 39:09.787
ell, if you think it's that important...

39:09.870 --> 39:12.915
why not meet me back at my hotel
in half an hour?

39:13.332 --> 39:15.459
- Okay, you're on.
- Okay, fine.

39:16.127 --> 39:17.753
- I'll see you then.
- Bye.

39:18.170 --> 39:19.296
Bye.

39:20.297 --> 39:21.716
Diana.

39:22.383 --> 39:24.468
You will call the police, won't you?

39:24.593 --> 39:26.804
I can take care of myself.

39:26.887 --> 39:28.431
And besides, if I need help...

39:28.514 --> 39:31.267
I have a friend I can call on
for assistance.

40:15.227 --> 40:19.231
You know how many times in my life
I've ever done a handstand? Once.

40:19.731 --> 40:22.859
Just think,
you're about to have done it twice.

40:37.082 --> 40:39.751
Contestant Number 9, Jamie O'Neill.

41:09.572 --> 41:11.533
The kid's good, isn't she?

41:17.288 --> 41:18.623
Yeah, Jamie.

41:47.276 --> 41:50.363
Next is contestant 24...

41:53.074 --> 41:54.784
Yeah, Jamie.

41:54.867 --> 41:56.661
As soon as this thing is over...

41:56.744 --> 42:00.248
pull her away for a photo session
I'll be in the parking lot with the car.

42:52.716 --> 42:56.303
I knew you were a criminal,
but a peeping Tom, too?

42:56.512 --> 42:58.722
Have you no shame, Mr. Markham?

42:59.640 --> 43:01.058
All right, speak up.

43:01.141 --> 43:03.894
Did Donalsen send you here
to kill Diana Prince?

43:03.977 --> 43:05.062
Yeah.

43:05.145 --> 43:08.857
- What else is Donalsen up to?
- He's going to nab the kid.

43:08.941 --> 43:11.151
- Jamie?
- He's got to find out how much she knows.

43:11.235 --> 43:14.279
Donalsen's sent some men
to the skateboard rink.

43:25.832 --> 43:28.252
All right, stick your hands through.

43:44.518 --> 43:47.604
That should hold you
until the police come.

43:51.358 --> 43:54.444
And the winner in freestyle, Jamie O'Neill!

43:59.950 --> 44:03.787
I'm Harris, with the Register. Can I get
a few shots of you on your board?

44:03.870 --> 44:06.665
It is a bit crowded.
We could go to the parking lot.

44:06.790 --> 44:09.167
- The surface is much smoother.
- Okay.

44:16.424 --> 44:20.345
What would you like me to do?
Handstands, christies, whatever you like.

44:20.428 --> 44:22.889
No, I'd like you
to step right in to this car.

45:24.241 --> 45:27.745
You're not gonna believe this,
but there's some broad on a skateboard...

45:27.828 --> 45:29.205
coming after us.

45:35.586 --> 45:37.129
And she's gaining.

46:20.255 --> 46:22.549
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

46:22.633 --> 46:25.010
They ought to give you an award,
Wonder Woman.

46:27.971 --> 46:31.308
- Isn't this beautiful?
- It's beautiful!

46:31.475 --> 46:33.143
Lovely, honey.

46:35.812 --> 46:38.649
Are you all ready
for the finals in San Francisco?

46:38.982 --> 46:41.568
Well, we just booked Mr. Donalsen
on every count...

46:41.652 --> 46:44.488
you can name and then some.
All thanks to you, Jamie.

46:44.571 --> 46:47.324
That map you memorized
led us to every one of his casinos.

46:47.407 --> 46:48.909
Anytime.

46:48.992 --> 46:51.203
You better dig in
before it's all gone, John.

46:51.286 --> 46:53.830
Don't worry, Diana.
I brought two more large pizzas.

46:54.331 --> 46:56.792
I hope everybody likes
anchovies and pepperoni?

46:56.875 --> 46:58.335
I love anchovies.

46:58.835 --> 47:02.380
Diana! I can't watch.

47:39.918 --> 47:40.960
