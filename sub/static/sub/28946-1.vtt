01:13.851 --> 01:15.734
Hi. Puppy Party Playdates?

01:15.769 --> 01:17.669
Yes, that's us. Hi.
I'm Hailey,

01:17.705 --> 01:19.683
and my business partner, Dana,
is just wrangling the puppies.

01:19.707 --> 01:21.340
The kids are
so looking forward to this.

01:21.375 --> 01:22.952
Now, these are living, breathing
puppies, right?

01:22.976 --> 01:24.576
Yep.

01:24.611 --> 01:25.722
I just want to make sure
I didn't get everyone's hopes up

01:25.746 --> 01:28.513
and they're not some kind of
robot toy or something.

01:28.549 --> 01:30.615
No. They are living,
breathing puppies...

01:32.019 --> 01:34.086
...who are ready to party.

01:40.661 --> 01:43.006
Okay, well, the kids will be
arriving in about half an hour,

01:43.030 --> 01:44.930
so let me show you
where to get set up.

01:44.965 --> 01:46.898
Okay, perfect.

02:04.605 --> 02:06.534
Here you go, you little rascal.

02:09.398 --> 02:10.354
Hailey...

02:11.525 --> 02:14.226
This might be the best
birthday party Jenny's ever had.

02:14.261 --> 02:15.994
Well, that's what
we like to hear.

02:16.029 --> 02:18.196
Last year, a parent gave me
a bad Yelp review

02:18.232 --> 02:20.899
because their kid didn't like
the party princess we hired.

02:20.934 --> 02:23.201
You got a Yelp review
for a birthday party?

02:23.237 --> 02:24.469
Yeah.
Let me tell you,

02:24.505 --> 02:26.171
parents can be ruthless
these days.

02:26.206 --> 02:28.006
Well, I think
you did an amazing job.

02:28.041 --> 02:30.041
Thank you.

02:32.579 --> 02:35.914
The shelter will contact you
to set up a one-on-one visit.

02:35.949 --> 02:37.682
Feel free
to contact them anytime.

02:37.718 --> 02:40.218
And take one of these.
It's for the dog park.

02:40.254 --> 02:42.487
We could really
use your signature.

02:42.523 --> 02:44.523
Bye, Georgie!
See you soon!

02:44.558 --> 02:46.658
So how are we doing?

02:46.693 --> 02:48.338
Looks like we got
some interest for Georgie.

02:48.362 --> 02:49.362
Yeah?

02:49.396 --> 02:51.430
Way to go, Georgie!

02:51.465 --> 02:54.099
You beat out all these puppies
and you're eight years old?

02:54.134 --> 02:55.834
And four potential
puppy adoptions.

02:55.869 --> 02:57.202
How about you?

02:57.237 --> 02:59.938
On our way
to a positive Yelp review.

02:59.973 --> 03:01.206
Hi. Are you interested

03:01.241 --> 03:03.542
in adopting
one of our rescue dogs?

03:03.577 --> 03:05.617
Hey, everyone!
Who wants cake and ice cream?

03:13.821 --> 03:15.520
I think he likes you.

03:15.556 --> 03:16.688
I like him, too.

03:16.723 --> 03:17.923
What's his name?

03:17.958 --> 03:20.525
He doesn't have a name yet,
but I've been calling him Rusty.

03:20.561 --> 03:22.127
Because of the color of his fur?

03:22.162 --> 03:24.262
No, but that's a good guess.

03:24.298 --> 03:25.575
Because I found him
and his brother

03:25.599 --> 03:27.566
under a rusty old truck.

03:27.601 --> 03:28.733
Where does he live now?

03:28.769 --> 03:30.735
Well, he lives
at the animal shelter,

03:30.771 --> 03:32.248
just till he can find
his forever home,

03:32.272 --> 03:33.438
like all the dogs here.

03:35.476 --> 03:38.210
I don't think you like
puppies at all, do you?

03:38.245 --> 03:39.311
What?

03:39.346 --> 03:41.713
I love puppies!
I love all dogs!

03:41.748 --> 03:42.581
What's your name?

03:42.616 --> 03:43.915
Emmy.

03:43.951 --> 03:47.752
Well, nice to meet you,
Emmy. I'm Hailey.

03:47.788 --> 03:49.454
I really want to get a dog,

03:49.490 --> 03:51.923
but my dad says
we can't right now.

03:51.959 --> 03:53.492
I'm sorry.

03:53.527 --> 03:54.626
It's okay.

03:54.661 --> 03:57.128
He promises someday we will...

03:57.164 --> 03:59.164
but "someday" is always
just another day, isn't it?

04:00.501 --> 04:02.067
How old are you, Emmy?

04:02.102 --> 04:03.568
Eight.

04:03.604 --> 04:05.837
Eight... Well, listen.

04:05.873 --> 04:07.539
Don't give up on your someday.

04:07.708 --> 04:10.475
I find, if you try hard enough,
it's just around the corner.

04:10.511 --> 04:11.776
I hope so.

04:13.146 --> 04:14.946
You want to go inside
and get some ice cream

04:14.982 --> 04:16.147
before all the puppies do?

04:16.183 --> 04:17.315
- Yeah.
- Okay.

04:21.288 --> 04:22.454
That's for you.

04:22.489 --> 04:23.588
Thanks.

04:23.624 --> 04:25.323
It was
a really fun birthday party.

04:25.359 --> 04:26.925
Thank you.

04:26.960 --> 04:29.094
Hey, you're not stealing
a puppy in that bag, are you?

04:29.129 --> 04:30.629
No!

04:30.664 --> 04:31.664
Well, listen.

04:31.698 --> 04:32.898
You tell your dad

04:32.933 --> 04:35.144
that there are a lot of dogs
in shelters that need a home,

04:35.168 --> 04:37.213
and they all think you would be
a really great best friend.

04:37.237 --> 04:38.937
- Is that right?
- Daddy!

04:38.972 --> 04:41.106
- You have fun?
- Yeah, it was great!

04:41.141 --> 04:42.874
Though I'm afraid she's smitten,

04:42.910 --> 04:44.376
and I heard he's a real dog.

04:44.411 --> 04:45.644
Is that so?

04:46.780 --> 04:48.980
Well, if I were you, I would
still check her goody bag

04:49.016 --> 04:52.350
because this little gal
can be a sneaky one.

04:52.386 --> 04:53.952
I'm Ryan, Emmy's father.

04:53.987 --> 04:54.987
Gathered that.

04:55.022 --> 04:57.856
Hailey, Puppy Party host.

04:57.891 --> 04:58.957
Gathered that.

04:58.992 --> 05:02.127
Well, nice to meet you...
briefly.

05:02.162 --> 05:03.929
You too... briefly.

05:06.033 --> 05:07.699
Thanks, Ann.

05:07.734 --> 05:09.174
My pleasure.
Thanks for coming, Emmy.

05:09.202 --> 05:11.369
- Bye.
- Bye.

05:11.405 --> 05:12.649
- These are for you.
- Bye. Bye, Emmy.

05:12.673 --> 05:13.705
Bye!

05:15.008 --> 05:16.541
"Puppy Party host".

05:20.280 --> 05:21.680
So...

05:21.715 --> 05:23.181
I was talking
to some of the mothers,

05:23.216 --> 05:25.517
and, apparently, your little
friend's dad is single.

05:25.552 --> 05:26.651
And?

05:26.687 --> 05:27.586
And if you're not interested,

05:27.621 --> 05:29.688
I will gladly volunteer
to explain to him

05:29.723 --> 05:31.489
all the benefits
of a rescue dog.

05:31.525 --> 05:33.992
Come on, I saw the way
you were looking at him!

05:34.027 --> 05:36.094
I was not looking at him,
and you know what?

05:36.129 --> 05:37.140
If you were
looking closely enough,

05:37.164 --> 05:39.097
you would see the way
that he was looking at me

05:39.132 --> 05:40.899
in his nicely tailored suit.

05:40.934 --> 05:43.435
Who doesn't like a girl
with frosting on her cheek?

05:43.470 --> 05:44.714
A guy in a nicely tailored suit.

05:44.738 --> 05:47.238
Anyway...

05:47.274 --> 05:50.275
we got almost 30 signatures
for the dog park campaign today.

05:50.310 --> 05:52.243
Getting pretty close.

05:52.279 --> 05:54.023
If we get to a thousand,
the Mayor will have to listen.

05:54.047 --> 05:55.047
Right?

05:55.082 --> 05:56.681
It's worth a shot.

06:10.430 --> 06:11.596
Come on, guys.

06:11.632 --> 06:12.632
How'd it go?

06:14.468 --> 06:16.601
Puppy mayhem as usual.

06:16.637 --> 06:18.770
And I bet they loved
every minute of it. Didn't you?

06:18.805 --> 06:21.406
They did, and they are all
ready for a good night's rest.

06:21.441 --> 06:23.086
You can go home
once they're in their rooms.

06:23.110 --> 06:24.110
I'll lock up.

06:24.144 --> 06:25.644
Okay. Bye, Hailey.

06:25.679 --> 06:28.580
Let's go, let's go.

06:28.615 --> 06:29.514
We got four adoptions.

06:29.549 --> 06:31.816
Nice. These puppy parties
are a great way

06:31.852 --> 06:32.962
to find families
for the rescues.

06:32.986 --> 06:35.654
Yup! The parties
are just a front.

06:35.689 --> 06:37.322
How long until
Mia's puppies are ready?

06:37.357 --> 06:39.168
I'm actually gonna go
meet with a veterinarian today,

06:39.192 --> 06:40.425
so I'll let you know tomorrow.

06:40.460 --> 06:43.328
Hey, you know, maybe you should
call Birthday Mom from today

06:43.363 --> 06:45.630
and find out where
Mr. Single Dad works,

06:45.666 --> 06:47.799
get him to sign the petition.

06:47.834 --> 06:49.501
Every signature helps, so...

06:49.536 --> 06:51.036
Bye.

06:52.372 --> 06:54.439
It does!

07:02.716 --> 07:04.949
Well, the stitches
are healing well.

07:04.985 --> 07:07.619
No more unexpected litters
from you, sweetheart.

07:07.654 --> 07:10.021
No one's claimed her yet?

07:10.057 --> 07:11.523
No. I put up signs.

07:11.558 --> 07:14.159
I bring photos of her
to all my parties,

07:14.194 --> 07:15.593
but no one's come forward.

07:15.629 --> 07:16.695
And she's so sweet.

07:16.730 --> 07:18.797
She has to be a house dog...

07:18.832 --> 07:21.466
No collar, no microchip,
no way to find the owner.

07:21.501 --> 07:22.400
Well, sometimes,

07:22.436 --> 07:24.013
when an owner finds out
they're pregnant,

07:24.037 --> 07:24.969
they drop them off somewhere.

07:25.005 --> 07:26.616
Happens more often
than you'd like to think.

07:26.640 --> 07:28.673
Well, she's lucky
she wandered into my yard.

07:28.709 --> 07:30.308
I guess we both are.

07:30.343 --> 07:31.988
I've really grown
to fall in love with her.

07:32.012 --> 07:33.678
Love them all, I bet.

07:33.714 --> 07:35.447
Yes!

07:35.482 --> 07:37.782
Well, with their last rounds
of shots complete,

07:37.818 --> 07:39.517
you'll be able
to find them homes.

07:39.553 --> 07:41.119
Thank you so much, Patricia.

07:41.154 --> 07:41.886
No problem.

07:41.922 --> 07:44.122
I will see you at the shelter.

07:44.157 --> 07:46.357
Okay, sounds perfect.
Bye. Thanks.

07:46.393 --> 07:50.161
Okay! Who's ready
for lunch, huh?

07:51.431 --> 07:53.009
What would you do
if you hadn't found me?

07:53.033 --> 07:57.268
You'd be raising these rugrats
all on your own, huh? Okay.

07:58.872 --> 07:59.971
Oh, goodness.

08:10.884 --> 08:12.717
- Hi, Fred.
- Look.

08:12.753 --> 08:14.085
I can't get into my driveway

08:14.121 --> 08:16.154
when you park
your van like that.

08:16.189 --> 08:17.722
It's... it's legally parked.

08:17.758 --> 08:18.857
There's not supposed

08:18.892 --> 08:21.760
to be any commercial vehicles
parked on this street.

08:21.795 --> 08:23.428
Okay, well, I can
go get my keys.

08:23.463 --> 08:24.529
Never mind!

08:24.564 --> 08:27.232
Just park it in your own
driveway from now on, okay?

08:30.036 --> 08:32.669
Have a nice day!

08:32.706 --> 08:34.005
Fred.

08:41.648 --> 08:43.515
I'll get you those returns
to you

08:43.549 --> 08:45.750
just as soon as
we have them finished, Dave.

08:45.786 --> 08:48.119
As always,
thanks for your business.

08:48.155 --> 08:49.053
And don't forget to look over

08:49.089 --> 08:50.855
the humanitarian grant
we have announced.

08:51.191 --> 08:52.690
Lots of applications
are coming in.

08:52.725 --> 08:53.725
Sure thing.

08:55.762 --> 08:56.661
Hey. Good morning,
Mr. Hennessy.

08:56.696 --> 08:57.762
Hello, Hailey.

08:57.797 --> 08:58.863
How are you?

08:58.898 --> 09:00.031
Just fine, thank you.

09:00.066 --> 09:00.932
Your dad said you did

09:00.967 --> 09:02.111
a lot of work on my returns
this year,

09:02.135 --> 09:05.069
and you're responsible for
getting it done so quickly.

09:05.105 --> 09:07.038
Yeah, I sure am.

09:07.073 --> 09:08.918
Your father showed me
your dog park petition earlier

09:08.942 --> 09:10.174
and I signed it right away.

09:10.210 --> 09:11.609
Thank you so much.

09:11.644 --> 09:13.010
I need all the support
I can get.

09:14.114 --> 09:15.079
Thank you.

09:15.115 --> 09:16.581
- See you.
- Bye.

09:16.616 --> 09:18.216
Dad, I'm sorry I'm late.

09:18.251 --> 09:20.051
I had to walk Mia
and the rest of the puppies.

09:20.086 --> 09:21.419
How are they doing?

09:21.454 --> 09:22.420
They're doing well.

09:22.455 --> 09:25.189
Mia's healing up nicely
after being spayed,

09:25.225 --> 09:27.036
and the puppies are almost ready
for their new home.

09:27.060 --> 09:28.060
That's great.

09:28.094 --> 09:31.395
By the way, I just saw this
this morning.

09:33.633 --> 09:34.699
Yet another developer

09:34.734 --> 09:37.435
trying to get their hands
on the Bryant Street land.

09:37.470 --> 09:39.303
Nobody wants
another shopping mall.

09:39.339 --> 09:41.205
Money talks.

09:47.313 --> 09:50.047
Puppy Party Playdates.
This is Hailey.

09:50.083 --> 09:50.948
This is Ryan Hill.

09:50.984 --> 09:52.294
We met at the puppy party
the other day.

09:52.318 --> 09:53.751
<i>Emmy's dad?</i>

09:53.786 --> 09:55.286
Yes. Yes, I remember.

09:55.321 --> 09:56.120
Hey, listen.

09:56.156 --> 09:57.788
All the puppies
are accounted for,

09:57.824 --> 09:59.924
so if Emmy ended up
taking one home,

09:59.959 --> 10:01.392
I had nothing to do with it.

10:01.427 --> 10:02.938
She wasn't hiding anything
in her goody bag

10:02.962 --> 10:03.995
when we got home.

10:04.030 --> 10:06.397
I'd still check
under her bed if I were you.

10:06.432 --> 10:08.299
I will.

10:08.334 --> 10:11.602
Listen, I know
this is last minute,

10:11.638 --> 10:14.405
but Emmy hasn't stopped
talking about those puppies.

10:14.440 --> 10:16.107
<i>Her birthday's this Saturday,</i>

10:16.142 --> 10:19.110
<i>and she was just going to have
some friends over,</i>

10:19.145 --> 10:21.779
but now I'm wondering
if I could surprise her

10:21.814 --> 10:23.581
with a puppy party instead.

10:23.616 --> 10:25.249
On Saturday? Sure.

10:25.285 --> 10:27.718
Let me just check my calendar.
One sec.

10:30.554 --> 10:32.520
Yeah, we can do Saturday.

10:32.556 --> 10:34.356
Really? That'd be great!

10:34.391 --> 10:36.424
I've got your email here
from the website.

10:36.460 --> 10:37.892
I could send you my information.

10:37.928 --> 10:38.860
Okay, great.

10:38.895 --> 10:40.440
Well, then, I look forward
to seeing you...

10:40.464 --> 10:42.330
seeing...

10:42.366 --> 10:44.866
<i>The party... I...</i>

10:44.901 --> 10:46.868
I look forward to seeing you
and Emmy both

10:46.903 --> 10:48.603
at the party on Saturday.

10:48.638 --> 10:50.071
Me too.

10:50.107 --> 10:51.706
I'll see you then.

10:51.742 --> 10:53.908
Bye.

10:53.944 --> 10:55.410
Another booking?

10:55.445 --> 10:57.979
Yeah, Saturday.

10:59.383 --> 11:01.049
What's that look?

11:02.285 --> 11:04.052
Do I have a look?

11:04.087 --> 11:06.287
More like a... a smile.

11:06.323 --> 11:08.189
What kind of smile?

11:08.225 --> 11:10.258
I'm not quite sure...

11:10.293 --> 11:12.193
but it's
a very particular smile.

11:13.296 --> 11:14.496
Well, listen, Dad.

11:14.531 --> 11:16.771
I know that Mr. Jameson wants
his taxes done by tomorrow,

11:16.800 --> 11:18.533
so do you happen to have
that folder?

11:18.568 --> 11:19.934
Yeah.

11:30.347 --> 11:31.646
Mr. Mayor.

11:31.681 --> 11:33.048
How's the analysis coming, Ryan?

11:33.083 --> 11:34.783
- Almost done.
- Good, good,

11:34.818 --> 11:36.629
because I'm getting
a lot of pressure from Halston.

11:36.653 --> 11:37.619
Developers are always pushy.

11:37.654 --> 11:38.654
They don't understand

11:38.688 --> 11:40.822
the checks and balances
we have to go through

11:40.857 --> 11:41.968
to make a project
like this happen.

11:41.992 --> 11:43.058
Right, right.

11:43.093 --> 11:45.004
It is important that
this does go through, though.

11:45.028 --> 11:47.228
We have a lot
riding on this, Ryan.

11:47.264 --> 11:48.975
You don't see
any unexpected hurdles, do you?

11:48.999 --> 11:50.065
No.

11:50.100 --> 11:52.233
Well, what about this petition
that's going around?

11:52.269 --> 11:53.768
What petition?

11:53.804 --> 11:54.969
Grassroots.

11:55.005 --> 11:56.571
Local dog owners, I guess.

11:56.606 --> 11:58.807
They want the land
turned into a dog park.

11:58.842 --> 12:00.408
I wasn't aware of a petition.

12:00.444 --> 12:01.476
Either way,

12:01.511 --> 12:03.178
we can't
let it gain any traction.

12:03.213 --> 12:04.179
I want this signed, sealed,

12:04.214 --> 12:05.992
and delivered
before they make any more waves.

12:06.016 --> 12:07.615
- I'm on it.
- Good man.

12:21.832 --> 12:23.131
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:23.166 --> 12:24.199
Nice to see you again.

12:24.234 --> 12:26.334
Yeah, nice to see you, too.

12:26.369 --> 12:28.103
- Hailey!
- Hi!

12:28.138 --> 12:29.971
Hey, is it really your birthday,

12:30.006 --> 12:31.651
or are you just wanting
to see the puppies?

12:31.675 --> 12:33.174
It's my birthday!

12:33.210 --> 12:34.375
They're so cute.

12:34.411 --> 12:36.778
Yeah? Do you want to help me
find a place to set them up?

12:36.813 --> 12:37.545
Sure!

12:37.581 --> 12:38.913
Okay. Come on, puppies.
Come on.

12:42.319 --> 12:43.952
Hi. Hi.

12:43.987 --> 12:45.498
I didn't introduce myself
at the last party.

12:45.522 --> 12:47.355
- I'm Dana.
- Hi.

12:47.390 --> 12:49.402
Best friend, business partner,
well, part-time partner

12:49.426 --> 12:51.993
of this little non-profit
we have here.

12:52.028 --> 12:53.406
I work at the shelter
where we get the dogs.

12:53.430 --> 12:54.729
It's kind of a win-win.

12:54.764 --> 12:56.064
That must keep you really busy.

12:56.099 --> 12:58.466
It does, but I still have
a lot of time

12:58.502 --> 13:01.202
'cause I'm not
really dating anyone, so...

13:02.606 --> 13:04.506
"Free time".

13:04.541 --> 13:07.308
Hey...
"best friend, business partner",

13:07.344 --> 13:08.344
a little help?

13:08.378 --> 13:09.944
Coming.

13:11.715 --> 13:13.481
Okay.

13:19.389 --> 13:22.524
Daddy, do you see
how much they like me?

13:22.559 --> 13:24.659
I see, sweetheart. I see.

13:27.964 --> 13:29.531
It means he's single.

13:29.566 --> 13:31.065
You should ask him out.

13:31.101 --> 13:32.367
What? No. No way.

13:32.402 --> 13:33.601
I can't do that.

13:33.637 --> 13:36.237
- Why not?
- Because he's a client.

13:36.273 --> 13:39.073
- And...?
- And it would be inappropriate.

13:39.109 --> 13:40.208
Why?

13:40.243 --> 13:41.676
Because it just would be,

13:41.711 --> 13:43.878
and because we're here
on official business.

13:43.914 --> 13:47.115
Well, he was looking
right through me at you.

13:47.150 --> 13:48.082
He was not.

13:48.118 --> 13:49.083
Yes, he was!

13:49.119 --> 13:51.452
Just go talk to him,

13:51.488 --> 13:53.128
before he crashes and burns
those burgers.

14:00.063 --> 14:02.463
Hey, can I help you?

14:02.499 --> 14:03.865
"Puppy Party" plates.

14:03.900 --> 14:07.135
Yeah, well, you ordered
the "deluxe" package.

14:07.170 --> 14:08.614
Now, if you ordered
the super-deluxe package,

14:08.638 --> 14:10.138
we even clean up
after the puppies

14:10.173 --> 14:11.272
when the party's over.

14:11.308 --> 14:12.473
Sounds expensive.

14:12.509 --> 14:14.742
<i>But well worth it.
Trust me.</i>

14:14.778 --> 14:15.778
Sold.

14:17.814 --> 14:20.215
Emmy seems to be
enjoying herself.

14:20.250 --> 14:22.383
She is! I'm not sure
if that's a good thing or not.

14:22.419 --> 14:24.953
This might mean she'll really,
really want a puppy now.

14:24.988 --> 14:26.332
Yeah, well,
you can always call us.

14:26.356 --> 14:27.755
"Puppy Party Playdates"...

14:27.791 --> 14:30.158
it's the next best thing,
without the mess.

14:30.193 --> 14:32.393
As long as you order
the super-deluxe package.

14:32.429 --> 14:34.128
- Right.
- Hey, you!

14:34.164 --> 14:35.430
So sorry I'm late.

14:35.465 --> 14:36.764
No, just in time.

14:36.800 --> 14:38.833
Hey, Emmy!

14:38.868 --> 14:41.002
- Hi!
- What's with all the puppies?

14:41.037 --> 14:43.304
This is Hailey.
Puppy Party Playdates.

14:43.340 --> 14:44.606
Hailey, Kelly.
We work together.

14:44.641 --> 14:45.573
Pleasure.

14:45.609 --> 14:47.008
Nice to meet you.

14:47.043 --> 14:48.576
So sorry to interrupt,

14:48.612 --> 14:50.912
but I do need to speak
with Ryan,

14:50.947 --> 14:52.625
so you don't mind
if I steal him for a sec?

14:52.649 --> 14:53.659
Yeah, yeah, sure.
Of course.

14:53.683 --> 14:55.483
Plain...

14:55.518 --> 14:56.518
the works.

14:56.553 --> 14:57.553
Yeah, sure.

15:04.294 --> 15:05.627
- Bye.
- Bye.

15:05.662 --> 15:06.961
- Bye.
- See you later.

15:06.997 --> 15:08.696
Bye.

15:08.732 --> 15:09.732
Hey, thank you so much

15:09.766 --> 15:11.477
for letting me host
your birthday party, Emmy.

15:11.501 --> 15:13.334
Those puppies would've been
so bored all day

15:13.370 --> 15:14.168
if we weren't here.

15:14.204 --> 15:16.170
In fact, they asked me
all morning,

15:16.206 --> 15:18.473
"When are we gonna go
to Emmy's house?"

15:18.508 --> 15:20.808
That was the best birthday party
I think I've ever had.

15:22.412 --> 15:24.445
Can I have another puppy party
next week?

15:26.149 --> 15:28.349
You know, I-I think

15:28.385 --> 15:30.551
it's gonna be hard
to convince your dad of that,

15:30.587 --> 15:34.989
but I did get you a very special
present for the birthday girl.

15:35.025 --> 15:36.491
He's so cute!

15:36.526 --> 15:38.359
I'm never going to let him
out of my sight.

15:38.395 --> 15:39.694
Thank you!

15:39.729 --> 15:41.729
You're welcome.

15:41.765 --> 15:44.866
Can I help put the puppies
back in the van?

15:44.901 --> 15:46.868
Sure, if that's all right?

15:46.903 --> 15:48.336
Yeah, definitely.

15:48.371 --> 15:50.091
Dana's out in the driveway,
loading them up.

15:52.876 --> 15:55.843
She has been asking me
at least once a week for a dog.

15:55.879 --> 15:58.880
I think now I can expect
that conversation every day.

15:58.915 --> 16:00.882
Yeah, well, if you ever
decide to adopt,

16:00.917 --> 16:02.517
I can help you with that.

16:02.552 --> 16:04.719
I mean, I can...

16:04.754 --> 16:06.187
you know, help you with...

16:06.222 --> 16:08.256
find, like, a dog-sitter.

16:08.291 --> 16:10.058
I know what you mean.

16:13.263 --> 16:15.997
Ry, what do you want me to do
with this leftover veggie tray?

16:16.032 --> 16:17.065
Toss? Save?

16:17.100 --> 16:18.399
What do you think?

16:18.435 --> 16:21.102
If it's edible,
I always save it.

16:21.137 --> 16:22.370
Save it.

16:22.405 --> 16:24.405
Okay. Hailey,
it was lovely to meet you.

16:24.441 --> 16:25.441
I hope to see you again.

16:25.475 --> 16:27.008
Nice to meet you, too.

16:27.043 --> 16:28.509
I should go.

16:28.545 --> 16:30.611
Of course. Thanks again.

16:30.647 --> 16:32.580
- Sure. Bye.
- Bye.

16:41.758 --> 16:42.724
I know that look.

16:42.759 --> 16:43.759
What look?

16:43.793 --> 16:45.893
Like you lost your puppy.

16:45.929 --> 16:48.596
Well, all the puppies
are accounted for, so...

16:48.631 --> 16:50.231
Didn't see her coming, did you?

16:50.266 --> 16:51.232
Who?

16:51.267 --> 16:52.133
Please!

16:52.168 --> 16:53.245
You know what,
it doesn't even matter,

16:53.269 --> 16:55.247
because it's not like I'm ever
gonna see him again.

16:55.271 --> 16:56.571
The party's over.

16:57.674 --> 16:58.973
What?

16:59.008 --> 17:01.776
This is the-the present
that I gave Emmy.

17:01.811 --> 17:04.241
She said she loved it.
She won't let out of her sight.

17:04.276 --> 17:06.425
Well, you've got to drop it off to them.

17:06.460 --> 17:08.128
I'll take Mia and the puppies
back to your house.

17:09.049 --> 17:11.249
All right. Are you sure?

17:11.285 --> 17:13.785
Cable, ice cream, and puppies?

17:13.819 --> 17:15.220
Yeah, I'm sure.

17:16.323 --> 17:17.323
Okay.

17:19.192 --> 17:20.825
Maybe you should change first.

17:21.707 --> 17:22.794
That's a good idea.

17:23.829 --> 17:25.563
Yeah.

17:44.319 --> 17:45.759
- Hi.
- Hi.

17:45.821 --> 17:47.387
Sorry to stop by like this.

17:47.422 --> 17:49.055
"Boojelly".

17:49.090 --> 17:50.790
What's Boojelly?

17:50.825 --> 17:52.492
Emmy's stuffed dog you gave her.

17:52.527 --> 17:53.738
She thought
she lost him forever.

17:53.762 --> 17:56.329
Yeah, then I guess
this is Boojelly.

17:56.364 --> 17:58.831
I found it in the van
when I was unpacking.

17:58.867 --> 18:00.500
How on Earth
did he end up in there?

18:00.535 --> 18:02.602
I guess
she just left it in there

18:02.637 --> 18:04.282
when she was saying goodbye
to the puppies.

18:04.306 --> 18:05.438
Thank you.

18:05.473 --> 18:07.307
It was nice of you
to bring him back.

18:07.342 --> 18:09.575
Sure. It's nothing.

18:09.611 --> 18:11.311
Okay, well, say hi
to Emmy for me.

18:11.346 --> 18:13.246
- I will.
- Okay.

18:13.281 --> 18:14.514
Okay.

18:14.549 --> 18:16.049
Hey...

18:17.986 --> 18:19.519
Do you want to come in?

18:19.554 --> 18:20.586
We're making cookies.

18:20.622 --> 18:22.075
Well, trying to, anyway.

18:22.110 --> 18:23.898
I'm sure Emmy would
want to say hello.

18:24.292 --> 18:26.175
I wouldn't want to interrupt.

18:26.228 --> 18:27.756
You won't be. Come on.

18:27.791 --> 18:29.607
You can return Boojelly
yourself.

18:29.631 --> 18:30.897
Okay.

18:32.634 --> 18:34.000
Emmy!

18:34.035 --> 18:36.936
There's someone here to see you.

18:36.972 --> 18:38.851
Hi! You brought it!

18:38.941 --> 18:40.552
I mean, you found it.

18:40.587 --> 18:41.810
I sure did.

18:41.845 --> 18:44.783
Thank you. I won't ever
leave him in your van again.

18:45.847 --> 18:47.914
How did you know
he was in the puppy van?

18:50.252 --> 18:51.252
Excuse me!

18:53.122 --> 18:54.488
Oh, no. Dad, not again.

18:59.962 --> 19:01.195
Got milk?

19:01.230 --> 19:04.164
I don't think there's anything
that can help wash these down.

19:04.200 --> 19:05.999
We were baking
for my office party.

19:06.035 --> 19:07.275
Well, if it's not too late,

19:07.303 --> 19:09.236
I happen to be
a really good baker.

19:09.271 --> 19:11.672
I could, you know,
help you start another batch.

19:11.707 --> 19:14.174
Thanks, but I think
we're gonna go with plan "B".

19:14.210 --> 19:15.242
What's plan "B"?

19:15.277 --> 19:16.777
- The Factory.
- Factory?

19:16.812 --> 19:17.678
It's our favorite bakery.

19:17.713 --> 19:19.913
Cookies that melt
in your mouth, right?

19:19.949 --> 19:20.747
Want to go for a walk?

19:20.783 --> 19:22.182
Can I get two cookies?

19:22.218 --> 19:23.183
One.

19:23.219 --> 19:24.451
Can Hailey come?

19:24.486 --> 19:26.019
Do you want to come?

19:26.055 --> 19:28.288
Or would you rather...

19:28.324 --> 19:30.457
try one of these guys instead?

19:30.492 --> 19:32.392
That's a tough call.

19:32.428 --> 19:34.094
I think I'll go with plan "B",

19:34.129 --> 19:35.529
Emmy, I think
she's pretty smart.

19:35.564 --> 19:36.897
Are you married?

19:36.932 --> 19:38.465
No.

19:38.500 --> 19:40.534
Emmy...

19:40.569 --> 19:42.402
why don't you go
get your jacket?

19:43.606 --> 19:44.871
Sorry about that.

19:44.907 --> 19:47.274
She can sometimes be
a bit precocious.

19:47.309 --> 19:49.376
No, precocious is a good thing.

19:49.411 --> 19:51.812
Means she'll probably get
what she wants out of life.

20:03.692 --> 20:04.992
The only rule is...

20:05.027 --> 20:06.560
you can't eat it all
in one bite.

20:06.595 --> 20:09.096
Okay.

20:11.467 --> 20:12.499
Told you.

20:12.534 --> 20:13.534
No, I mean, seriously.

20:13.569 --> 20:16.803
I mean, this is the best cookie
I've ever had.

20:16.839 --> 20:18.605
Can I have another, Daddy?

20:18.641 --> 20:19.806
You already ate it?

20:19.842 --> 20:21.441
We had an agreement, remember?

20:21.477 --> 20:23.010
Okay.

20:23.045 --> 20:24.978
Can I go and check out
the toy store, then?

20:25.014 --> 20:26.747
As long as I can see you.

20:26.782 --> 20:29.249
You two take your time.
See you in a little bit.

20:31.987 --> 20:32.919
What?

20:32.955 --> 20:34.421
Nothing.

20:34.456 --> 20:35.856
No, come on. Tell me.

20:35.891 --> 20:39.660
She's just watched too many
old-school Full House episodes.

20:39.695 --> 20:41.128
I don't get it.

20:41.163 --> 20:42.929
The dad on that show,

20:42.965 --> 20:44.931
his daughters are always
trying to set him up.

20:44.967 --> 20:47.200
Let's just say she likes you.

20:47.236 --> 20:49.503
That's because
I'm a dog lady or, even worse,

20:49.538 --> 20:50.604
a puppy lady.

20:50.639 --> 20:51.639
Maybe.

20:52.808 --> 20:54.708
It's just been hard
for her to understand

20:54.743 --> 20:55.976
that's not my focus.

20:56.011 --> 20:57.289
You know, between my job
and raising her,

20:57.313 --> 20:58.445
lots to juggle.

20:58.480 --> 21:02.516
Essentially, I'm not sure
what a social life is anymore.

21:02.551 --> 21:03.695
I know exactly what you mean.

21:03.719 --> 21:04.963
I feel like
I'm in the same boat.

21:04.987 --> 21:06.197
I mean, we have
the puppy parties,

21:06.221 --> 21:07.954
then I work with my dad
during the week,

21:07.990 --> 21:10.057
and then I have
the new puppies at home.

21:10.092 --> 21:11.803
I feel like I never have
a moment to myself.

21:11.827 --> 21:13.894
Yeah. Anyway,
you've made an impression,

21:13.929 --> 21:16.563
hence the Boojelly ploy.

21:16.598 --> 21:18.332
Wasn't left by accident.

21:18.367 --> 21:20.467
Take it as a compliment.
She's very particular.

21:20.502 --> 21:22.202
Okay, I will.

21:22.237 --> 21:24.104
You have...

21:25.341 --> 21:26.341
No, on the other side.

21:30.379 --> 21:32.846
Awesome.

21:32.881 --> 21:36.416
Chocolate, frosting,
ice cream, dog hair...

21:36.452 --> 21:38.692
I can't leave my house without
something on me somewhere.

21:38.721 --> 21:39.853
You host puppy parties,

21:39.888 --> 21:41.399
you're bound to end up
with at least one or the other.

21:41.423 --> 21:43.323
Yeah.
That reminds me.

21:43.359 --> 21:45.826
I meant to bring a petition
to your house yesterday.

21:45.861 --> 21:48.228
I'm hoping to build a dog park
at the Bryant Street land.

21:49.398 --> 21:50.664
The... The petition?

21:50.699 --> 21:52.165
Yeah. Wait.
Have you heard about it?

21:52.201 --> 21:53.700
I have, in fact.

21:53.736 --> 21:54.668
I was thinking

21:54.703 --> 21:57.070
that if I could get
a thousand signatures,

21:57.106 --> 21:59.172
then maybe I can
convince city hall

21:59.208 --> 22:01.541
to build a dog park
instead of another strip mall.

22:01.577 --> 22:03.043
Do you think that'll be enough?

22:03.078 --> 22:05.512
Well, I don't know.
I mean, I hope.

22:05.547 --> 22:07.280
I've been working really hard.

22:07.316 --> 22:09.383
I've called city hall,
trying to get a meeting

22:09.418 --> 22:10.317
with anyone over there,

22:10.352 --> 22:12.352
especially
that lug-headed city planner.

22:12.388 --> 22:14.788
"Lug-headed"?

22:14.823 --> 22:15.834
He's just afraid
that if he doesn't

22:15.858 --> 22:17.724
give the Mayor and his cronies
what they want,

22:17.760 --> 22:18.859
then he'll lose his job.

22:18.894 --> 22:21.428
Cronies, huh?

22:21.463 --> 22:22.763
Yeah. Well, anyway,

22:22.798 --> 22:24.598
maybe you could bring it
to your office,

22:24.633 --> 22:26.133
get some people
to sign the petition.

22:26.168 --> 22:27.567
We're really, really,
really close.

22:29.037 --> 22:30.704
What are you guys talking about?

22:30.739 --> 22:32.505
Dogs and puppies?

22:32.541 --> 22:34.407
We are, actually.

22:34.443 --> 22:36.176
Wait! For your office party?

22:36.211 --> 22:37.143
My office party?

22:37.179 --> 22:40.080
Yeah! A puppy party
would be so much fun.

22:40.115 --> 22:41.381
A puppy party...

22:41.416 --> 22:42.549
at my office party.

22:42.584 --> 22:43.483
Yeah! Like I did.

22:43.518 --> 22:44.896
Yeah, we do office parties
all the time.

22:44.920 --> 22:45.852
What's the occasion?

22:45.887 --> 22:47.454
Our new offices.

22:47.489 --> 22:48.955
Everyone will love it.

22:48.990 --> 22:50.457
I don't know about that.

22:50.492 --> 22:52.225
Besides, it's in a few days.

22:52.260 --> 22:54.861
Well, we do last-minute
very well,

22:54.896 --> 22:57.230
and besides, it's for
a really good cause

22:57.265 --> 22:58.932
that needs more awareness.

22:58.967 --> 23:01.067
Awareness.
Well, that's true.

23:01.103 --> 23:02.302
The puppies are just bait.

23:02.337 --> 23:05.572
Our real goal is to find homes
for all of our rescue dogs.

23:09.010 --> 23:10.477
All right...

23:10.512 --> 23:11.512
All right!

23:13.915 --> 23:15.582
Okay.

23:15.617 --> 23:17.083
These cookies are amazing.

23:17.119 --> 23:18.119
They are.

23:32.834 --> 23:34.114
I see you parked it there again.

23:36.271 --> 23:37.737
I'm so sorry, Fred.

23:37.773 --> 23:40.473
I... My business partner,
she drove the van home,

23:40.509 --> 23:44.511
and I forgot to tell her
to not park it on the street.

23:44.546 --> 23:47.247
I saw her bringing a gaggle
of puppies into the house...

23:47.282 --> 23:48.282
again.

23:48.316 --> 23:52.952
Well, I'm fostering
a stray who had puppies.

23:52.988 --> 23:55.121
Well, just get the van
off the street,

23:55.157 --> 23:58.458
and don't let those puppies
onto my lawn.

23:58.493 --> 24:00.493
Will do.

24:12.174 --> 24:14.274
Oh, dear.

24:16.244 --> 24:18.378
You're... you're home.

24:18.413 --> 24:20.480
Yeah. Hey, thanks
for watching the puppies.

24:20.515 --> 24:21.681
Anytime.

24:21.716 --> 24:23.650
Why are you so late?

24:23.685 --> 24:25.125
Emmy and Ryan
invited me downtown

24:25.153 --> 24:26.219
to get some cookies.

24:26.254 --> 24:27.620
Do tell.

24:27.656 --> 24:28.656
Nothing to tell.

24:28.690 --> 24:29.622
I knew it!

24:29.658 --> 24:30.790
Knew what?

24:30.826 --> 24:31.991
He's into you.

24:32.027 --> 24:33.027
You're reading into this.

24:33.061 --> 24:34.527
He invited you to dessert.

24:34.563 --> 24:36.462
Emmy asked me for dessert.

24:36.498 --> 24:37.263
Small details.

24:37.299 --> 24:39.666
Okay, you know what?
Good night.

24:39.701 --> 24:42.168
A handsome widower
with a fantastic daughter?

24:42.204 --> 24:44.070
He's a catch.
Let's just hope he's employed.

24:44.105 --> 24:45.349
Well, fortunately for us, he is.

24:45.373 --> 24:47.652
We're doing a puppy party at
his office party this Saturday.

24:47.676 --> 24:49.008
Okay, then.

24:49.044 --> 24:50.743
Sorry about the ice cream.

24:50.779 --> 24:53.279
- I was hungry.
- Okay.

24:58.954 --> 25:00.320
OK, stop. This is it.

25:01.490 --> 25:04.124
Are you sure?
Because...

25:04.159 --> 25:06.693
...This is City Hall?

25:18.274 --> 25:19.806
- Hi.
- Hi.

25:19.842 --> 25:22.709
So you work at City Hall?

25:22.745 --> 25:24.544
Yep. I'm the lug-headed
city planner.

25:24.580 --> 25:25.712
That is not fair.

25:25.748 --> 25:28.081
Fair is exactly
what I want to be.

25:28.117 --> 25:30.317
You deserve a chance
to speak with the Mayor

25:30.352 --> 25:31.485
and explain to everyone

25:31.520 --> 25:33.253
why you feel the dogs
in our community

25:33.289 --> 25:35.122
are in need of a big open park.

25:35.157 --> 25:37.791
Which you're against?

25:37.826 --> 25:39.259
Not so much against,

25:39.295 --> 25:41.628
but I am in favor
of the retail development.

25:41.664 --> 25:43.964
Okay, so why have me come here?

25:43.999 --> 25:47.768
Because this is your city hall
as much as it is mine...

25:47.803 --> 25:48.935
and fair is fair.

25:48.971 --> 25:50.437
All right.

25:50.472 --> 25:54.274
Well, I have to warn you,
puppies are very persuasive.

25:54.310 --> 25:56.243
Advantage Hailey.

25:56.278 --> 25:58.245
Okay, so where should I set up?

25:58.280 --> 26:00.814
Come on, I'll show you around.

26:13.495 --> 26:15.295
Sorry!

26:15.331 --> 26:16.331
Gotcha.

26:17.366 --> 26:18.498
There you are.

26:18.534 --> 26:19.933
I just want to be sure.

26:19.968 --> 26:22.502
They are
all potty-trained, right?

26:22.538 --> 26:24.504
Yeah, I think so,
for the most part.

26:24.540 --> 26:26.139
Which part?

26:28.243 --> 26:29.810
I think he likes you.

26:29.845 --> 26:30.944
You want to hold him?

26:30.979 --> 26:33.046
No, I'm not really a dog person.

26:33.082 --> 26:34.981
I mean, he will grow into
a dog eventually.

26:35.017 --> 26:36.583
Yes, but he doesn't
know that yet, so...

26:36.619 --> 26:37.619
I suppose.

26:38.721 --> 26:41.488
He is kind of cute,
isn't he?

26:41.524 --> 26:44.525
Yes, he is.

26:44.560 --> 26:46.994
Although sometimes cats
are a better choice.

26:47.029 --> 26:49.263
I mean, it's hard
to become a dog person

26:49.298 --> 26:50.264
if you're not yet, you know?

26:50.299 --> 26:52.166
There are dog people,
there are cat people.

26:52.201 --> 26:54.768
The two rarely mix.
Bad, bad mix.

26:54.803 --> 26:57.871
Well, I think I could be
persuaded with that face.

26:59.008 --> 27:01.542
Excuse me.

27:01.577 --> 27:03.510
She's a cat person.

27:07.149 --> 27:08.882
Hailey, have you met Mayor Betz?

27:08.918 --> 27:11.018
No, but I've been hoping to.

27:11.053 --> 27:12.619
Well, I appreciate that.

27:12.655 --> 27:15.155
So what do you think
of our new City Hall?

27:15.191 --> 27:18.058
It's very impressive,
and the puppies love it, too.

27:18.093 --> 27:19.893
They're really cute,
aren't they?

27:19.929 --> 27:22.162
It's hard to say no
to puppies, right?

27:22.198 --> 27:24.798
Especially when it comes
to a big open dog park.

27:25.868 --> 27:27.634
Dog park?

27:27.670 --> 27:28.969
Yeah.

27:29.004 --> 27:31.572
Hailey's the one
who started the petition

27:31.607 --> 27:34.041
to turn the Bryant Street land
into a dog park.

27:34.076 --> 27:36.243
Of course.

27:36.278 --> 27:38.478
But we have a dog park
already, don't we?

27:38.514 --> 27:40.647
You know, there is one,
but it's really small,

27:40.683 --> 27:44.418
and what we could really use
is just a big open space

27:44.453 --> 27:45.986
so the dogs
to roam around freely,

27:46.021 --> 27:49.690
and the Bryant Street land
is the perfect spot for it.

27:49.725 --> 27:50.791
Right.

27:50.826 --> 27:54.595
Well, thank you for voicing
your opinion on that,

27:54.630 --> 27:57.264
but tonight we are all here
to celebrate our new city hall,

27:57.299 --> 27:59.566
so if you'll excuse me?

28:01.237 --> 28:03.070
He can be a bit headstrong.

28:03.105 --> 28:05.172
It's nothing I can't handle.

28:05.207 --> 28:07.941
I just need to do
some more digging.

28:07.977 --> 28:08.875
Digging?

28:08.911 --> 28:10.844
Is that what you do
in your spare time?

28:10.879 --> 28:13.046
I'm an accountant,
so I just mean I...

28:13.082 --> 28:15.582
Digging into numbers,
that's kind of what I do best.

28:15.618 --> 28:17.584
Accountant? Impressive.

28:17.620 --> 28:18.885
So says my dad.

28:20.923 --> 28:24.024
Dog on the loose.
I'll... I'll be right back.

28:24.059 --> 28:25.059
Just... okay.

28:33.802 --> 28:35.369
Oh, no, you don't!

28:36.505 --> 28:38.538
Stop it!

28:48.651 --> 28:51.251
One of the puppies
found my golf clubs?

28:51.287 --> 28:53.453
Close! Golf shoes.

28:57.593 --> 29:00.227
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to snoop.

29:00.262 --> 29:03.597
This is a...
a really nice photo.

29:03.632 --> 29:05.065
Emmy's mom?

29:05.100 --> 29:06.199
Yeah.

29:07.870 --> 29:10.437
She was really beautiful.

29:10.472 --> 29:12.239
She was.

29:12.274 --> 29:15.342
I... heard a couple of the moms
at Emmy's birthday party

29:15.377 --> 29:17.477
talking about
how she'd passed on.

29:17.513 --> 29:19.313
That's how I knew.

29:19.348 --> 29:21.448
Five years ago, cancer.

29:21.483 --> 29:23.950
Emmy was just three.

29:23.986 --> 29:25.352
Still remembers her.

29:25.387 --> 29:27.788
That must have been very hard.

29:27.823 --> 29:29.189
Was.

29:29.224 --> 29:30.490
Sometimes still is...

29:32.127 --> 29:35.195
But Emmy and I are
a tight little team,

29:35.230 --> 29:36.830
and you only know
what you know, right?

29:38.834 --> 29:43.103
So Emmy knew life with
her amazing, beautiful mom...

29:43.138 --> 29:45.539
and now she knows
life with just me.

29:45.574 --> 29:48.175
Well, that's a really great
way to look at life.

29:48.210 --> 29:49.530
It's the only way
to look at life.

29:50.913 --> 29:53.680
Life's... what's
right in front of you.

29:53.716 --> 29:56.983
It's the now, the present,

29:57.019 --> 29:59.386
even if it is complicated.

29:59.421 --> 30:02.456
Which life always is.

30:02.491 --> 30:04.358
Okay...

30:04.393 --> 30:06.827
And I wanted to thank you...

30:06.862 --> 30:09.029
for introducing me to the mayor,

30:09.064 --> 30:11.531
even though
I'm still hoping for...

30:11.567 --> 30:13.500
for a more official meeting.

30:13.535 --> 30:14.835
Of course.

30:14.870 --> 30:17.404
I thought
an introduction would help.

30:17.439 --> 30:19.373
Even though
you're against the dog park?

30:19.408 --> 30:22.776
Even though I'm in favor
of the retail project, yes.

30:25.280 --> 30:26.346
Hi there.

30:26.382 --> 30:27.914
Thank you so much, Ryan.

30:27.950 --> 30:30.584
Everyone is having
a really great time.

30:30.619 --> 30:33.053
It sure looks like it,
but thank Emmy and Hailey.

30:33.088 --> 30:34.688
They're the ones
that talked me into it.

30:35.791 --> 30:37.057
No!

30:38.560 --> 30:39.993
My new rug!

30:41.564 --> 30:42.730
I'm so mortified.

30:42.765 --> 30:44.109
<i>Come on!
Everyone thought it was funny.</i>

30:44.133 --> 30:45.265
Not the Mayor,

30:45.301 --> 30:47.801
especially if he was showing off
his very expensive rug.

30:47.837 --> 30:49.837
Mayor Betz shows off
everything he has to everyone.

30:51.073 --> 30:51.872
I wouldn't be surprised

30:51.907 --> 30:53.774
if Ryan never
speaks to me again,

30:53.809 --> 30:56.110
and now they're never gonna
consider the dog park.

30:56.145 --> 30:57.145
<i>It'll be fine.</i>

30:58.447 --> 31:00.325
<i>At least now you know
who you need to lobby.</i>

31:00.349 --> 31:01.215
Yeah, okay.
I got to go!

31:01.250 --> 31:03.617
Talk about juggling a lot!
Look at you!

31:03.652 --> 31:07.021
I actually
consider myself a master.

31:07.056 --> 31:08.176
Here, let me take something.

31:10.426 --> 31:11.892
Hi...

31:11.927 --> 31:13.327
Hi.

31:13.362 --> 31:14.906
You actually just caught me
finishing lunch

31:14.930 --> 31:15.763
with some colleagues,

31:15.798 --> 31:17.965
who are still talking
about the party.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.299
Not the Mayor, I hope.

31:19.335 --> 31:22.536
No, but he did appreciate
the gift card

31:22.571 --> 31:23.637
for the rug cleaning.

31:23.672 --> 31:25.873
Well...
the least I could do.

31:25.908 --> 31:27.908
We all had a pretty good
laugh about it.

31:27.943 --> 31:29.021
Even the mayor, eventually.

31:29.045 --> 31:31.023
No one's ever gonna take
the petition seriously now,

31:31.047 --> 31:32.047
though, are they?

31:32.081 --> 31:33.380
I can't say for certain.

31:33.416 --> 31:34.515
I wish I could.

31:34.550 --> 31:35.716
I don't understand

31:35.751 --> 31:38.685
why this city
needs another strip mall.

31:38.721 --> 31:41.588
Just like you, there's
a need for this retail space.

31:41.624 --> 31:43.757
One of the tenants
is going to be "Tot Drop",

31:43.793 --> 31:45.526
which is affordable daycare

31:45.561 --> 31:47.694
a lot of the people
in this area could use.

31:47.730 --> 31:49.663
There's also going be
a music store,

31:49.698 --> 31:51.276
which has agreed to offer
free music lessons

31:51.300 --> 31:52.411
to kids who buy instruments.

31:52.435 --> 31:55.102
Advantage Ryan.

31:55.137 --> 31:57.071
Have you researched
any other vacant lots

31:57.106 --> 31:58.572
where you could
build a dog park?

31:58.607 --> 32:00.274
There is this one place,

32:00.309 --> 32:01.887
but we just...
we don't have the funding.

32:01.911 --> 32:04.244
The Bryant Street land
was allocated by the city,

32:04.280 --> 32:05.879
so it was funded by the city.

32:05.915 --> 32:08.515
Which would require
tax revenue to pay for it.

32:09.985 --> 32:12.219
Are you aware
that the EPA requires

32:12.254 --> 32:14.688
that every municipality dedicate
a certain amount

32:14.723 --> 32:16.757
of protected wetlands
per square acreage?

32:16.792 --> 32:18.125
Yes, I am.

32:18.160 --> 32:19.793
A dog park would qualify.

32:19.829 --> 32:21.195
You've done your research.

32:21.230 --> 32:22.262
I have.

32:22.298 --> 32:23.397
Check the water table.

32:23.432 --> 32:25.799
I will.

32:25.835 --> 32:27.868
Okay.

32:27.903 --> 32:29.570
So how's Emmy?

32:29.605 --> 32:32.473
Perusing your website
any chance she gets.

32:32.508 --> 32:34.308
Still plotting then, huh?

32:34.343 --> 32:36.877
Always.
In fact...

32:36.912 --> 32:39.813
You want to bring her over
to see the dogs sometime?

32:39.849 --> 32:41.014
She's been begging me.

32:42.118 --> 32:43.484
She would go binoculars

32:43.519 --> 32:45.330
if she knew I got to see them
today without her.

32:45.354 --> 32:47.221
Well, I'll give you
my address, then.

32:47.256 --> 32:49.256
So I'll see you...

32:49.291 --> 32:51.758
This weekend?

32:51.794 --> 32:52.957
Perfect.

32:53.598 --> 32:54.561
Perfect.

32:54.597 --> 32:55.896
You got to...

32:55.931 --> 32:57.898
Yeah.

32:57.933 --> 32:59.144
Okay, I'll see you this weekend.

32:59.168 --> 33:00.334
Bye, puppies.

33:00.369 --> 33:01.835
- Here.
- Yep, I can get that.

33:01.871 --> 33:03.003
All right.
See you later.

33:03.038 --> 33:03.871
Yeah. Bye.

33:03.906 --> 33:05.973
Okay. Hey, out of the dirt!
Let's go.

33:15.818 --> 33:17.017
You're honestly gonna

33:17.052 --> 33:19.386
lobby me about this dog park
after what happened to my rug?

33:19.421 --> 33:20.587
It came out, didn't it?

33:20.623 --> 33:21.588
That's not the point!

33:21.624 --> 33:24.057
It's the principle.

33:24.093 --> 33:25.192
Besides...

33:25.227 --> 33:26.560
I told you,

33:26.595 --> 33:28.273
we've got a lot riding
on this Bryant Street.

33:28.297 --> 33:30.197
You know, along comes
Puppy Party lady,

33:30.232 --> 33:32.432
and suddenly
you change your mind.

33:32.468 --> 33:33.508
I haven't changed my mind.

33:33.536 --> 33:36.103
In the end, it's up to you
and the city council.

33:36.138 --> 33:38.272
I'm just saying...
she has a point.

33:40.576 --> 33:43.744
A dog park would be good
for you, too, you know.

33:43.779 --> 33:45.012
How?

33:48.817 --> 33:51.485
Mark, you're the Mayor.
You're an elected official.

33:51.520 --> 33:52.986
Do I need to elaborate?

33:53.022 --> 33:55.197
Big business
and tax revenue are fine,

33:55.357 --> 33:58.259
and again, I do think the Bryant
Street project is a good idea,

33:58.721 --> 34:01.473
but you need to reach out
to the rest of your constituents

34:01.497 --> 34:02.381
a little more.

34:02.499 --> 34:03.832
Like Hailey, right?

34:05.235 --> 34:08.770
Like Hailey
and a lot of other people.

34:10.574 --> 34:13.842
Hey, you're going to bat
for this dog park for a reason.

34:13.877 --> 34:15.877
I like dogs.

34:15.911 --> 34:17.277
<i>You like her.</i>

34:18.547 --> 34:21.516
You like her, right?

34:26.623 --> 34:28.089
It's a slam dunk, buddy.

34:28.125 --> 34:30.257
Time to get back
into the dating game...

34:30.293 --> 34:33.828
but no promises
on the dog park, okay?

34:33.864 --> 34:35.864
Bryant Street
has to stay on track.

34:37.266 --> 34:38.366
Take that.

34:47.310 --> 34:50.178
Okay, you guys.
Give your mama a break.

34:54.083 --> 34:55.583
Hey! Stay.

34:58.388 --> 35:00.255
- Hi!
- Hi.

35:00.290 --> 35:02.023
Are you here to see the puppies?

35:02.058 --> 35:03.569
My dad's
just on a call in the car.

35:03.593 --> 35:04.792
Okay.

35:04.828 --> 35:06.861
Well, the puppies
are right in there.

35:06.897 --> 35:10.398
Also, I heard him talking
on the phone about you.

35:10.433 --> 35:11.933
Really?

35:11.968 --> 35:13.401
Well, what did he say?

35:13.436 --> 35:16.037
Not sure,
but he was talking about you.

35:17.240 --> 35:18.940
You know, you're pretty funny.

35:20.644 --> 35:21.743
Who's that?

35:23.747 --> 35:28.149
That's me, and that was my mom.

35:28.185 --> 35:29.617
Where's your mom now?

35:29.653 --> 35:31.819
She's not around anymore.

35:31.855 --> 35:34.088
She passed a few years ago.

35:34.124 --> 35:35.957
Mine too.

35:37.327 --> 35:40.094
Want to go see some puppies?

35:44.201 --> 35:45.633
Oh, my gosh.

35:45.669 --> 35:48.636
Hashtag "cute"!

35:48.672 --> 35:51.406
Did my eight-year old just
use "hashtag" in a sentence?

35:51.441 --> 35:53.675
She definitely did.

35:53.710 --> 35:55.743
Do they have names yet?

35:55.779 --> 35:58.413
No, I decided not to name them,

35:58.448 --> 36:00.982
but you see how they have
different-colored collars?

36:01.017 --> 36:02.450
That's how I tell them apart.

36:02.485 --> 36:05.687
See, this guy right here,
his name is Mr. Orange.

36:05.722 --> 36:09.958
He looks like an otter
when he lays on his back.

36:09.993 --> 36:12.126
That's so funny.
I thought the very same thing.

36:12.562 --> 36:14.729
Hey, what do you think
of the name "Otter"?

36:14.764 --> 36:16.697
I like it a lot.

36:16.733 --> 36:17.898
"Otter" it is.

36:17.934 --> 36:19.100
He is really special.

36:19.135 --> 36:21.102
How come?

36:21.137 --> 36:23.004
Well, he won't eat his dog food,
he refuses to,

36:23.039 --> 36:24.083
so I've had to feed him
with a bottle.

36:24.107 --> 36:25.072
He's so big.

36:25.108 --> 36:27.508
That's 'cause he's still
getting his nutrients,

36:27.543 --> 36:30.544
but it's time this little guy
gets off the bottle.

36:30.580 --> 36:32.713
Can I try?

36:32.749 --> 36:34.615
Yeah, sure.

36:34.651 --> 36:36.884
Why not?

36:42.792 --> 36:43.758
Ho, ho, ho.

36:43.793 --> 36:45.760
Here you go.

36:46.929 --> 36:48.963
Come on, Otter. Try it.

36:52.635 --> 36:55.236
Hey, it looks like
someone has a new best friend.

36:55.271 --> 36:57.304
I see what's going on already.

36:57.340 --> 36:59.540
I think I just got cornered.

36:59.575 --> 37:00.875
Yeah, you definitely did.

37:00.910 --> 37:02.877
So should I put him
on hold for you?

37:02.912 --> 37:04.945
I don't think we're ready yet.

37:04.981 --> 37:08.049
It wouldn't be fair
to any of us,

37:08.084 --> 37:09.583
including Otter there.

37:09.619 --> 37:11.752
Well, you know,

37:11.788 --> 37:14.121
when Mia wandered into
my backyard, pregnant,

37:14.157 --> 37:15.456
I thought there was no way

37:15.491 --> 37:17.625
I could handle
that responsibility,

37:17.660 --> 37:20.895
but turns out she rescued me
more than the other way around.

37:20.930 --> 37:22.170
Especially after my mom passed.

37:22.198 --> 37:25.232
It's something to think about.

37:31.774 --> 37:34.275
And he should eat
his kibble right up,

37:34.310 --> 37:36.944
but make sure you feed it
from your hand, not the bowl.

37:36.979 --> 37:38.446
He isn't ready for that yet.

37:38.481 --> 37:40.281
Aye-aye, Captain.

37:40.316 --> 37:42.983
I'll see you soon, Otter.
Be a good boy.

37:43.019 --> 37:44.785
Thanks, Hailey.

37:44.821 --> 37:47.221
Thank you, Emmy.

37:50.026 --> 37:52.460
This made her day...

37:52.495 --> 37:53.661
Her week!

37:53.696 --> 37:55.329
Well, month, really.

37:55.364 --> 37:57.698
I don't think I've seen her
this happy in a long time.

37:57.734 --> 37:59.867
Dogs do that to people.

37:59.902 --> 38:01.535
Man and girl's best friend.

38:01.571 --> 38:03.037
I know,

38:03.072 --> 38:05.806
and while I might not
be ready to commit...

38:05.842 --> 38:07.842
to a puppy,

38:07.877 --> 38:10.311
maybe there's a compromise.

38:10.346 --> 38:11.278
A compromise?

38:11.314 --> 38:13.314
Maybe Emmy can come around
once in a while

38:13.349 --> 38:14.648
and help out with the dogs,

38:14.684 --> 38:17.184
or even work
at your next puppy party.

38:17.220 --> 38:19.053
I've been looking

38:19.088 --> 38:21.066
to give her some responsibility,
and I think this might be it.

38:21.090 --> 38:22.690
I think that would be awesome.

38:22.725 --> 38:24.625
I'd have to come with her,
of course.

38:24.660 --> 38:26.894
So I'd have to see you again?

38:26.929 --> 38:28.129
You'd have to see me again.

38:29.398 --> 38:31.132
I think I can handle that.

38:32.201 --> 38:33.834
I'll call you.

38:33.870 --> 38:35.202
I'll answer.

38:35.238 --> 38:37.471
Okay. Bye.

38:37.507 --> 38:39.473
Bye.

38:42.078 --> 38:44.445
You're so cute.

38:48.584 --> 38:49.917
You come up with anything?

38:49.952 --> 38:51.018
No, not yet.

38:51.053 --> 38:54.054
No tax breaks that will
mean anything to the city,

38:54.090 --> 38:55.689
and Ryan seems like
he wants to help,

38:55.725 --> 38:59.493
but it's just I have to come up
with something more concrete

38:59.529 --> 39:00.561
that he can work with.

39:00.596 --> 39:02.196
Well, even if you do,

39:02.231 --> 39:04.409
do you think he'll still be able
to bend the Mayor's ear?

39:04.433 --> 39:06.367
I don't know.

39:06.402 --> 39:08.442
Keep digging, honey.
I'm sure you'll find something.

39:34.263 --> 39:36.597
Okay, so...

39:41.204 --> 39:43.778
I'm so glad
you guys could help me today.

39:43.841 --> 39:46.281
I really want to show you
this cool place.

39:49.079 --> 39:50.879
So this is it.
What do you think?

39:50.914 --> 39:52.347
It's amazing.

39:52.382 --> 39:55.850
Yeah, it's my own
little private sanctuary

39:55.886 --> 39:58.219
for all of the rescue dogs.

39:58.255 --> 39:59.255
It's 10 acres,

39:59.289 --> 40:02.590
so the dogs love to run outside
without a leash,

40:02.626 --> 40:03.703
and they love being in here.

40:03.727 --> 40:04.559
Sometimes, I set up

40:04.594 --> 40:06.728
obstacle courses
and things like that.

40:06.763 --> 40:08.096
It's just amazing.

40:08.131 --> 40:09.175
How are you able to use it?

40:09.199 --> 40:10.343
My dad, one of his clients,

40:10.367 --> 40:12.500
he knows the company
who owns it,

40:12.536 --> 40:14.280
and they're not using it,
so they don't mind.

40:14.304 --> 40:18.540
Okay, so I'm gonna
ask the obvious question...

40:18.575 --> 40:21.543
wouldn't this make
a much better dog park

40:21.578 --> 40:22.944
than the Bryant Street land?

40:22.979 --> 40:25.180
Yes, it will make
the most amazing dog park,

40:25.215 --> 40:26.781
and I think about that
all the time.

40:26.816 --> 40:28.016
I mean, if I had this land,

40:28.051 --> 40:30.118
I would make it way more
than a dog park.

40:30.153 --> 40:31.619
I'd make it a sanctuary.

40:31.655 --> 40:33.721
I mean, can you imagine
all of those dogs

40:33.757 --> 40:35.623
that are just sitting in cages
in the shelter?

40:35.659 --> 40:37.525
If I made this whole thing
into a sanctuary

40:37.561 --> 40:39.561
where they could live,

40:39.596 --> 40:43.298
and then they'd have 10 acres
to just roam around in?

40:43.333 --> 40:44.599
And?

40:44.634 --> 40:45.667
It's just...

40:45.702 --> 40:49.470
The company, they're owned
by a bigger corporation,

40:49.506 --> 40:52.540
and so their intention is,
at some point,

40:52.576 --> 40:54.542
to sell it
to the highest bidder.

40:54.578 --> 40:56.711
I take it you've already
made your plea with them.

40:56.746 --> 40:58.313
Yes, I have,
about a million times.

40:59.282 --> 41:01.549
Short of buying it
for a million dollars,

41:01.585 --> 41:03.551
the answer is a resounding no.

41:03.587 --> 41:05.587
So...

41:05.622 --> 41:08.223
that's kind of why I was hoping
that the Bryant Street land

41:08.258 --> 41:10.458
would be made into a dog park.

41:10.493 --> 41:11.971
Because that land's
owned by the city,

41:11.995 --> 41:14.395
and we can do
whatever we want with it.

41:14.431 --> 41:15.711
That's what
I was thinking, yeah.

41:17.033 --> 41:18.466
Look, Daddy!

41:18.501 --> 41:21.035
- The puppies remember me.
- I can see that.

41:21.071 --> 41:23.905
You know, resistance is futile.

41:23.940 --> 41:25.406
It's starting to seem that way.

42:16.359 --> 42:18.037
Hey, do you think
that you could bring them

42:18.061 --> 42:19.560
in the living room
to their momma?

42:19.596 --> 42:20.640
You think you can handle it?

42:20.664 --> 42:21.629
Yes.

42:21.665 --> 42:24.065
Come on. Let's go.

42:24.100 --> 42:25.833
Thank you.

42:25.869 --> 42:27.635
Oh, my goodness...

42:27.671 --> 42:30.038
How soon do you think
they'll be adopted?

42:30.073 --> 42:31.239
Pretty soon,

42:31.274 --> 42:32.451
especially after the next party.

42:32.475 --> 42:35.043
I mean, people already can
put them on hold if they want.

42:35.078 --> 42:37.645
Yeah... I bet they do.

42:38.948 --> 42:40.315
I just don't want
to let Emmy down.

42:41.584 --> 42:44.719
Yeah.

42:44.754 --> 42:46.087
Listen, the only thing worse

42:46.122 --> 42:47.922
than an animal
not getting adopted

42:47.957 --> 42:49.490
is if someone brings them home

42:49.526 --> 42:51.893
when they're not really
willing to commit.

42:52.962 --> 42:54.028
It's just...

42:54.064 --> 42:56.144
the animals normally get
brought back to the shelter.

42:57.934 --> 42:59.367
I don't think there's any chance

42:59.402 --> 43:01.736
of an animal in our house
being neglected.

43:01.771 --> 43:04.505
Yeah, definitely not.

43:04.541 --> 43:07.108
It's just,

43:07.143 --> 43:10.345
you know, I wouldn't want Emmy
to get too attached to Otter

43:10.380 --> 43:12.780
if the answer's still
gonna be no for a while.

43:12.816 --> 43:14.549
It'll just make things
harder on her.

43:15.785 --> 43:16.884
Things can change.

43:16.920 --> 43:18.119
Really?

43:18.154 --> 43:20.388
Maybe things already have.

43:21.658 --> 43:24.058
I just, I wouldn't want her
to get her hopes up.

43:28.798 --> 43:30.131
It's a great thing you're doing,

43:30.166 --> 43:31.566
with the Puppy Party Playdates,

43:31.601 --> 43:34.268
raising awareness
and money for shelter dogs.

43:35.772 --> 43:37.372
It's pretty spectacular.

43:37.407 --> 43:38.573
Thanks.

43:38.608 --> 43:40.041
Well, you know,

43:40.076 --> 43:41.909
when you spend as much time
as I do with dogs,

43:41.945 --> 43:42.977
you know what you learn?

43:43.012 --> 43:45.713
Is that they would
just have such an amazing time

43:45.749 --> 43:49.784
if they had
a big, wide-open space

43:49.819 --> 43:52.653
that they could roam around in,
like a dog park.

43:54.457 --> 43:57.759
I don't really give up easily,
you know.

43:57.794 --> 43:59.160
I can't imagine you would.

43:59.195 --> 44:01.629
And I'm not really
an idealist, okay?

44:01.664 --> 44:04.999
I understand the practicality
of what I'm asking for.

44:05.034 --> 44:07.135
Then you also know
that I have to support

44:07.170 --> 44:08.603
what I think's best
for the city.

44:08.638 --> 44:10.405
They're not greedy developers.

44:10.440 --> 44:12.407
They're not "cronies".

44:12.442 --> 44:15.476
There would be real benefits
for a lot of people.

44:15.512 --> 44:18.413
Yeah, I understand
your perspective...

44:19.783 --> 44:21.749
But would you mind
if I just sent you

44:21.785 --> 44:24.585
the park renderings
and proposal?

44:24.621 --> 44:26.621
Absolutely,

44:26.656 --> 44:27.855
but to be honest,

44:27.891 --> 44:30.591
I'm not sure
it's going to do any good.

44:30.627 --> 44:32.827
Okay, well, I have to follow
my heart on this one.

44:32.862 --> 44:35.263
As the saying goes,

44:35.298 --> 44:36.298
"follow your heart,

44:36.332 --> 44:39.133
because you never know
where it might lead you".

44:43.072 --> 44:45.239
I...

44:50.380 --> 44:52.146
Hey there, Kel.
What's up?

44:52.182 --> 44:54.348
<i>Are you still going to
the retirement party tonight?</i>

44:54.384 --> 44:56.350
Yeah.
Yeah, I'll be there.

44:56.386 --> 44:57.663
<i>Would you mind giving me a ride?</i>

44:57.687 --> 44:59.487
My car's acting so funny.

44:59.522 --> 45:01.489
Yeah, sure.
I'll call when I'm on my way.

45:01.524 --> 45:03.324
<i>You are the best. Bye.</i>

45:06.563 --> 45:08.529
That was Kelly.

45:08.565 --> 45:12.200
Yeah. I...
I saw that.

45:12.235 --> 45:14.368
One of our administrators
is retiring.

45:14.404 --> 45:15.870
Lost track of time,

45:15.905 --> 45:17.872
and I have a babysitter coming.

45:17.907 --> 45:20.842
If it's helpful to you,
I could watch Emmy.

45:22.946 --> 45:25.213
Thanks, but I hate to cancel
on the sitter.

45:25.248 --> 45:27.548
Yeah, sure, of course.

45:29.052 --> 45:30.351
Emmy.

45:30.386 --> 45:31.919
We have to go, sweetie.

45:31.955 --> 45:34.655
Okay.

45:36.192 --> 45:37.091
Bye, Hailey.

45:37.126 --> 45:39.327
Bye.

45:40.230 --> 45:41.230
Bye, Otter!

45:43.867 --> 45:45.700
Bye...

45:45.735 --> 45:47.702
Bye.

46:01.526 --> 46:02.883
- Hi.
- Hey, there.

46:02.918 --> 46:04.618
That was so much fun last night.

46:04.653 --> 46:06.031
- Thank you for bringing me.
- You're welcome.

46:06.055 --> 46:08.488
Listen, I know you're busy,

46:08.524 --> 46:10.824
but I need some help with
the Bryant Street development.

46:10.859 --> 46:12.492
How so?

46:12.528 --> 46:14.005
I just want to make sure
we've covered our bases.

46:14.029 --> 46:16.863
I think I might've
stumbled upon something...

46:16.899 --> 46:18.532
something Hailey said to me.

46:18.567 --> 46:20.467
Hailey, the puppy lady?

46:20.502 --> 46:22.803
Yes, that Hailey.

46:22.838 --> 46:25.572
Would you be able to look into
our legal obligation

46:25.607 --> 46:27.974
for total citywide
wetland requirements?

46:28.010 --> 46:28.975
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

46:29.011 --> 46:30.011
Thank you.

46:35.517 --> 46:37.484
I'll be!

46:44.193 --> 46:46.026
So what are we doing out here?

46:46.061 --> 46:47.728
Walk with me.

46:47.763 --> 46:49.262
Hey, this is the land

46:49.298 --> 46:51.198
owned by
the Farley Corporation, right?

46:51.233 --> 46:52.299
Didn't this come up

46:52.468 --> 46:55.001
on a possible
development proposal?

46:55.037 --> 46:56.603
Yep.

46:56.638 --> 46:59.272
I see
where you're going with this.

46:59.308 --> 47:01.208
You're thinking shopping...

47:01.243 --> 47:03.243
condos,

47:03.278 --> 47:04.845
beautiful little strip mall...

47:04.880 --> 47:05.946
right?

47:05.981 --> 47:07.047
Not quite.

47:07.082 --> 47:08.115
Mini-storage?

47:08.150 --> 47:09.683
Mayor...

47:10.886 --> 47:12.786
Must be serious.
You called me "Mayor".

47:12.821 --> 47:14.588
Sanctuary.

47:14.623 --> 47:16.556
Sanctuary?

47:16.592 --> 47:18.458
For whom?

47:18.494 --> 47:21.261
They tend to walk on all fours
and bark.

47:22.931 --> 47:25.599
Here, the dog park?

47:25.634 --> 47:27.134
Not just a dog park.

47:27.169 --> 47:29.703
A lot of rescue dogs
never find a new home,

47:29.738 --> 47:31.071
and they never
leave the shelter.

47:31.106 --> 47:32.906
This would guarantee them

47:32.941 --> 47:35.709
a place to live
until they find a new home.

47:35.744 --> 47:37.310
You're selling me on this, why?

47:37.346 --> 47:38.378
As you know,

47:38.414 --> 47:40.091
we have a federally-mandated
wetland requirement.

47:40.115 --> 47:41.381
Right.

47:41.417 --> 47:43.417
I took a look
at the water tables.

47:43.452 --> 47:44.885
This land qualifies.

47:44.920 --> 47:46.720
It should've been designated
a long time ago,

47:46.755 --> 47:47.755
but it wasn't.

47:47.790 --> 47:48.922
Because it's private land.

47:48.957 --> 47:49.790
The Farley Corporation

47:49.825 --> 47:52.659
has always had
an intention to sell it.

47:52.694 --> 47:54.461
Listen, Ryan, there's other land

47:54.496 --> 47:56.129
that we can
designate as wetland.

47:56.165 --> 47:57.431
Mark, come on.

47:57.466 --> 47:59.399
This takes the pressure
off Bryant Street.

47:59.435 --> 48:00.834
The city gets
what it wants there,

48:00.869 --> 48:02.569
Hailey gets what she wants here.

48:02.604 --> 48:06.006
Okay, are there
any legal ramifications?

48:06.041 --> 48:08.608
City council approval,
your signature...

48:08.644 --> 48:09.576
I've already spoken

48:09.611 --> 48:11.945
to a representative
at Farley Corporation.

48:11.980 --> 48:13.146
They weren't aware.

48:13.182 --> 48:15.449
I see you've done your homework.

48:15.484 --> 48:16.583
I want to do it right,

48:16.618 --> 48:18.485
one step at a time.

48:23.358 --> 48:25.025
Here is
Mr. Hennessy's corporate,

48:25.060 --> 48:26.960
ready for him
to look over and sign.

48:26.995 --> 48:27.995
That was quick.

48:28.030 --> 48:29.240
- He'll be very impressed.
- Yeah.

48:29.264 --> 48:32.098
Especially when he sees how much
money we're gonna save him.

48:38.740 --> 48:39.673
Hi.

48:39.708 --> 48:42.008
Did I get you at a good time
or a bad time?

48:42.044 --> 48:43.844
A good time.

48:43.879 --> 48:45.156
Can you get away
for a few minutes?

48:45.180 --> 48:46.340
I want to show you something.

48:47.483 --> 48:49.316
Yeah, sure. Where?

48:49.351 --> 48:51.818
Someplace that just might
make you smile.

48:58.827 --> 49:00.794
I could have put this
in an email,

49:00.829 --> 49:02.796
but I wanted
to show you in person.

49:02.831 --> 49:04.364
Okay.

49:04.399 --> 49:06.166
What does this city need more...

49:06.201 --> 49:09.970
new retail space
offering music lessons, daycare,

49:10.005 --> 49:12.539
convenient medical,
or...

49:12.574 --> 49:15.575
a community park where people
can let their dogs run free,

49:15.611 --> 49:17.811
and maybe even
a sanctuary for rescue?

49:17.846 --> 49:19.079
Come on.

49:19.114 --> 49:20.981
- Is that a trick question?
- The trick...

49:21.016 --> 49:22.849
is how does
our city council decide

49:22.885 --> 49:25.652
between a non-revenue project

49:25.687 --> 49:27.487
or a highly-lucrative
development?

49:27.523 --> 49:30.223
Well...

49:30.259 --> 49:31.825
we could give them all puppies.

49:31.860 --> 49:35.161
Not bad,
but I think I found something.

49:35.197 --> 49:36.263
Both!

49:36.298 --> 49:39.099
What?
I don't understand.

49:39.134 --> 49:39.900
You're the one who said it.

49:39.935 --> 49:42.736
Our municipality
is required by law

49:42.771 --> 49:45.071
to maintain a certain amount
of designated wetland

49:45.107 --> 49:46.873
within the city limits.

49:46.909 --> 49:47.841
The people who own this land,

49:47.876 --> 49:49.876
they plan on selling
to a developer, right?

49:49.912 --> 49:50.877
Houses, retail?

49:50.913 --> 49:51.878
Yeah, exactly.

49:51.914 --> 49:53.947
Except...

49:53.982 --> 49:58.351
this land was designated
as wetland

49:58.387 --> 49:59.452
a decade ago.

49:59.488 --> 50:01.755
It can't be developed.
They just don't know it yet.

50:01.790 --> 50:03.056
Yeah, okay,

50:03.091 --> 50:04.558
so what does that mean, then?

50:04.593 --> 50:08.361
I mean, how can you turn it
into a dog sanctuary?

50:08.397 --> 50:10.542
It means the land's worth
a lot less than they thought.

50:10.566 --> 50:11.731
They'll want to dump it.

50:11.767 --> 50:13.233
Do you think the city

50:13.268 --> 50:15.302
would actually approve
an animal sanctuary?

50:15.337 --> 50:16.636
I don't see why not.

50:16.672 --> 50:18.805
I... I don't know what to say.

50:18.840 --> 50:20.073
You'll have to come up

50:20.108 --> 50:22.809
with the funds to buy the land
and turn it into a sanctuary,

50:22.844 --> 50:23.777
so now we have that hurdle...

50:23.812 --> 50:25.745
But you're telling me
that it's possible?

50:25.781 --> 50:26.913
Yeah.

50:26.949 --> 50:28.615
Thank you!

50:30.519 --> 50:32.886
Are you...
Are you gonna get that?

50:32.921 --> 50:35.121
Yeah. It's just...

50:35.157 --> 50:36.323
It's actually an alarm.

50:36.358 --> 50:37.602
I have to go check
on the puppies.

50:37.626 --> 50:38.670
Hey, do you want
to come with me?

50:38.694 --> 50:41.328
I could get you a dozen cookies
from The Factory?

50:41.363 --> 50:42.796
How can a guy say no to that?

50:42.831 --> 50:44.164
Well, hopefully, he doesn't.

50:52.140 --> 50:54.274
You never said anything
about grooming them.

50:54.309 --> 50:55.942
You didn't ask for details.

50:55.978 --> 50:57.644
Classic bait-and-switch.

50:57.679 --> 50:58.679
You know what?

50:58.714 --> 50:59.679
I will not tell Emmy

50:59.715 --> 51:02.482
that you were moonlighting
without her again.

51:02.517 --> 51:04.217
There would be no forgiveness.

51:07.623 --> 51:10.924
So how did
your retirement party go?

51:10.959 --> 51:12.425
Retirement party?

51:12.461 --> 51:14.194
It was fine.

51:14.229 --> 51:15.349
It was at McGary's, in town.

51:19.568 --> 51:21.835
Did Kelly get her car fixed?

51:21.870 --> 51:24.604
I'm not sure,
but I'm guessing so.

51:24.640 --> 51:26.773
I just assumed you would know.

51:26.808 --> 51:28.308
You know,
you two are close friends.

51:28.343 --> 51:30.644
Old friends
that have become close friends.

51:30.679 --> 51:31.878
Who have dated?

51:31.913 --> 51:33.780
Dated?

51:33.815 --> 51:36.983
No! I mean, we've gone out
for dinner a few times,

51:37.019 --> 51:38.019
but not like that.

51:40.656 --> 51:42.022
She was a close friend of Liz's,

51:42.057 --> 51:44.491
and after she died,

51:44.526 --> 51:48.294
Kelly really helped me out,
emotionally...

51:48.330 --> 51:50.163
and with Emmy.

51:52.367 --> 51:54.300
It's really remarkable
that you do this.

51:54.336 --> 51:55.568
What, brush puppies?

51:55.604 --> 51:56.870
Rescue them.

51:56.905 --> 51:58.016
I don't really have a choice.

51:58.040 --> 51:58.872
Yes, you do,

51:58.907 --> 52:01.141
but you follow your heart,
don't you?

52:01.176 --> 52:03.643
Well, you never know
where it can lead.

52:09.451 --> 52:10.984
I'll be right back.

52:11.019 --> 52:13.486
All right.

52:13.522 --> 52:15.955
I'm in trouble.

52:24.232 --> 52:25.398
Hailey Goode?

52:27.536 --> 52:29.602
So this "Puppy Party Playdates",
it's your business?

52:29.638 --> 52:30.882
You're running it
out of your home?

52:30.906 --> 52:32.739
No, it's nothing like that.

52:32.774 --> 52:34.207
It's just I'm fostering a stray

52:34.242 --> 52:36.376
who wandered into my yard
while she was pregnant,

52:36.411 --> 52:39.279
and then she had the puppies,
so now I'm fostering both.

52:39.314 --> 52:40.380
Right. Well,

52:40.415 --> 52:41.659
there's been a complaint
from one of your neighbors,

52:41.683 --> 52:43.928
who brought it to the attention
of the city administrators.

52:43.952 --> 52:45.785
A complaint?

52:45.821 --> 52:46.931
Business vehicle
parked on the street,

52:46.955 --> 52:48.733
a number of dogs being brought
in and out of the house.

52:48.757 --> 52:50.190
Do you have a license?

52:50.225 --> 52:52.625
She doesn't need a license
to foster animals.

52:52.661 --> 52:54.728
Well, no, but there is
a city ordinance

52:54.763 --> 52:57.764
that stipulates a maximum
of three dogs per household,

52:57.799 --> 52:58.631
and if it's part of
her business,

52:58.667 --> 53:01.234
then she's in violation
of the law.

53:01.269 --> 53:02.635
I'm sorry.

53:02.671 --> 53:03.937
Oh, come on, you're kidding.

53:03.972 --> 53:05.939
Is there anyone I can talk to?

53:05.974 --> 53:07.574
City Hall?

53:14.449 --> 53:16.449
There are no exceptions.

53:16.485 --> 53:18.418
The business isn't run
out of my house.

53:18.453 --> 53:19.252
We do the parties

53:19.287 --> 53:21.221
at other people's homes
and parks.

53:21.256 --> 53:22.567
Yet you're breeding dogs
out of the home

53:22.591 --> 53:23.623
for this business?

53:23.658 --> 53:25.258
No, no.
I'm not breeding dogs.

53:25.293 --> 53:26.826
Mia is a rescue.

53:26.862 --> 53:29.095
She was pregnant
when I found her.

53:29.131 --> 53:30.597
Did you obtain
a dog license for her?

53:30.632 --> 53:32.398
No.

53:32.434 --> 53:34.300
I meant to.
I really did.

53:34.336 --> 53:35.568
I just... I forgot.

53:35.604 --> 53:37.570
You're aware
there's a city ordinance,

53:37.606 --> 53:39.405
maximum three dogs?

53:39.441 --> 53:41.307
Yes. Puppies are exempt.

53:41.343 --> 53:42.842
Up to a certain age.

53:42.878 --> 53:44.611
Janice, she's not
doing anything illegal.

53:44.646 --> 53:46.780
Perhaps not intentionally,

53:46.815 --> 53:47.959
but the business
and residential address

53:47.983 --> 53:48.948
are one and the same,

53:48.984 --> 53:50.183
and now dogs in that home

53:50.218 --> 53:51.651
are being used
for that business.

53:51.686 --> 53:53.920
Business vehicles
are being parked on the street.

53:53.955 --> 53:56.256
Look, it's only until
I can get the puppies adopted.

53:56.291 --> 53:57.335
There have already been
several complaints

53:57.359 --> 53:58.258
from your neighbors.

53:58.293 --> 54:01.761
"Neighbors" plural
or neighbor singular?

54:03.131 --> 54:06.332
Listen, Fred complains
when someone flushes the toilet.

54:06.368 --> 54:07.300
That may be,

54:07.335 --> 54:09.669
but at this point,
it's a matter of the law,

54:09.704 --> 54:11.104
and the law is quite clear.

54:11.139 --> 54:12.139
I'm sorry.

54:14.242 --> 54:16.709
What's your dog's name?

54:16.745 --> 54:17.777
Excuse me?

54:17.813 --> 54:19.279
The photo.

54:24.085 --> 54:25.351
Abby.

54:25.387 --> 54:27.353
She died a few months ago.

54:27.389 --> 54:29.422
I'm so sorry.

54:31.092 --> 54:32.692
But my point is,
you're a dog person.

54:32.727 --> 54:33.693
Right? I can tell.

54:33.728 --> 54:35.461
Very much so.

54:35.497 --> 54:36.707
Well, what would you do
if Abby...

54:36.731 --> 54:37.530
Ms. Goode,

54:37.566 --> 54:39.399
my love for animals
has no bearing

54:39.434 --> 54:41.479
on whether or not you can
run a business out of your home

54:41.503 --> 54:42.902
or foster too many pets.

54:42.938 --> 54:45.471
It may be very well-intended,
but at this point,

54:45.507 --> 54:48.508
you're in violation
of several city codes.

54:48.543 --> 54:52.011
Puppy Party Playdates must
cease and desist immediately.

54:55.717 --> 54:57.650
Thanks, Janice.

55:00.555 --> 55:03.256
Janice is one of those people
who'll reject a permit

55:03.291 --> 55:04.924
if an "i"
isn't dotted correctly.

55:04.960 --> 55:07.160
Well, is there anyone else
we can talk to?

55:07.195 --> 55:08.161
There might be.

55:08.196 --> 55:10.430
- Who?
- Kelly.

55:10.465 --> 55:13.399
She's the city attorney
and reports to the mayor.

55:13.435 --> 55:14.500
She knows Janice well.

55:14.536 --> 55:17.337
If anyone can find a crack
in her armor, it's Kelly.

55:17.372 --> 55:19.505
Okay, well, let's call her
to set up a meeting.

55:19.541 --> 55:20.740
Okay.

55:26.314 --> 55:28.581
So she's agreed on a compromise.

55:28.617 --> 55:30.984
Puppy Party Playdates
will retain its license,

55:31.019 --> 55:33.253
but the dogs must be removed
from the house.

55:33.288 --> 55:34.420
She then wants proof that

55:34.456 --> 55:36.990
the puppies have been adopted
or sent to the shelter,

55:37.025 --> 55:39.292
certified by new owners.

55:39.327 --> 55:40.660
Can't we fight this?

55:40.695 --> 55:43.129
Of course,
but do you really want to?

55:43.164 --> 55:46.299
She can permanently
revoke your business license.

55:46.334 --> 55:48.001
Not that it will stick,

55:48.036 --> 55:49.413
but it'll be a hassle
trying to get that back.

55:49.437 --> 55:50.403
There's just no way

55:50.438 --> 55:52.149
we're gonna get the dogs
adopted that quickly.

55:52.173 --> 55:53.139
What about the shelter?

55:53.174 --> 55:55.508
I already called so many,

55:55.543 --> 55:57.577
and just like every other
shelter in the state,

55:57.612 --> 55:58.778
they're full,

55:58.813 --> 56:01.080
and besides, Ryan, I don't
want them in a shelter anyway.

56:01.116 --> 56:03.516
They need to feel loved,
not alone.

56:03.551 --> 56:05.151
Well...

56:05.186 --> 56:07.620
bring them to my house.

56:07.656 --> 56:08.721
You're not allowed

56:08.757 --> 56:12.191
to operate a business from
your house, either, Ryan.

56:12.227 --> 56:14.027
I'm not operating a business
from my house.

56:14.062 --> 56:16.930
The ordinance still applies...
too many dogs.

56:16.965 --> 56:19.832
It'll get Janice off her back
long enough

56:19.868 --> 56:21.000
until the next party,

56:21.036 --> 56:22.769
gives the puppies
a place to live

56:22.804 --> 56:24.203
until they find their own homes,

56:24.239 --> 56:27.106
and keeps Hailey's
Puppy Party Playdates

56:27.142 --> 56:28.207
in operation,

56:28.243 --> 56:30.009
which helps find those homes.

56:30.045 --> 56:32.378
We just have to make sure
the puppies get adopted quickly.

56:32.414 --> 56:34.113
Are you sure about this?

56:34.149 --> 56:35.381
Not entirely,

56:35.417 --> 56:38.718
but I know a certain little girl
who'll be very happy about it.

56:45.894 --> 56:47.460
Okay, no peeking.

56:47.495 --> 56:49.529
Okay, sweetie.
You can open them now.

56:51.232 --> 56:53.132
Did we adopt them all?

56:54.102 --> 56:55.468
No.

56:55.503 --> 56:57.181
We're just watching them
for a little while

56:57.205 --> 56:58.171
until the next party.

56:58.206 --> 57:01.341
I hope there's never
another puppy party ever.

57:03.111 --> 57:04.544
How can I say no now?

57:04.579 --> 57:06.379
Hey, it's good practice.

57:06.414 --> 57:08.147
When is the next party?

57:08.183 --> 57:10.249
That would be next weekend.

57:10.285 --> 57:12.018
It's my friend's
engagement party.

57:12.053 --> 57:14.520
She should only be attached
to all of them by then.

57:16.758 --> 57:19.192
Sure you won't get in trouble
with City Hall for this?

57:19.227 --> 57:20.593
I don't think so.

57:20.628 --> 57:22.061
Nobody needs to know.

57:22.097 --> 57:23.596
Just glad I could help out.

57:23.631 --> 57:25.131
Me too.

57:26.568 --> 57:28.001
Come here.

57:28.036 --> 57:29.736
Would you like
to stay for dinner?

57:30.805 --> 57:32.472
Sure.

57:33.708 --> 57:35.186
There's a great noodle shop
down the street.

57:35.210 --> 57:36.275
I'll go pick it up.

57:36.311 --> 57:38.544
Okay. I'll stay here
and watch Emmy

57:38.580 --> 57:39.879
and the rest of the gang.

57:39.914 --> 57:41.114
Be back in a few.

57:41.149 --> 57:42.181
Okay.

57:46.421 --> 57:48.988
Are you so excited?

57:55.997 --> 57:58.965
Do you think my dad
will ever let me keep Otter?

57:59.000 --> 58:01.634
I think he's close.

58:01.669 --> 58:03.569
I think your dad
just wants to make sure

58:03.605 --> 58:05.116
that you'll hold up your end
of the bargain.

58:05.140 --> 58:06.205
What's a bargain?

58:06.241 --> 58:08.207
A bargain is...
an agreement.

58:09.310 --> 58:10.376
Like the other day,

58:10.412 --> 58:12.056
when your dad said you could
only have one cookie.

58:12.080 --> 58:13.780
That's a bargain.

58:13.815 --> 58:14.881
He just wants to make sure

58:14.916 --> 58:16.761
he's not the only one
who's taking care of Otter.

58:16.785 --> 58:18.785
Can anyone adopt Otter?

58:18.820 --> 58:22.588
Well, someone could...

58:22.624 --> 58:24.957
but I find it usually works
the other way around.

58:24.993 --> 58:26.459
What do you mean?

58:26.494 --> 58:28.928
Well, think about Mia, right?

58:28.963 --> 58:32.165
She's a sweet, amazing dog,

58:32.200 --> 58:33.933
and I have no idea
where she came from,

58:33.968 --> 58:35.468
but she didn't have a home,

58:35.503 --> 58:38.137
and at first, I thought
something was wrong with her,

58:38.173 --> 58:40.239
but do you know why Mia
was alone for so long?

58:41.943 --> 58:45.044
Because...
she hadn't chosen anyone.

58:46.314 --> 58:49.015
You know, dogs are very smart,
and they're picky,

58:49.050 --> 58:51.517
and she turned down
all the other offers

58:51.553 --> 58:53.786
because she wanted
to be with me.

58:53.822 --> 58:55.788
Do you think there's a way
to convince my dad

58:55.824 --> 58:57.557
that I'll live up to my end
of the bargain?

58:59.127 --> 59:00.927
I have an idea.

59:00.962 --> 59:02.295
Do you have paper and markers?

59:03.298 --> 59:04.597
Okay.

59:12.507 --> 59:14.640
What are you two up to?

59:16.010 --> 59:19.112
Emmy and I have been working
on something together,

59:19.147 --> 59:21.214
so please have a seat.

59:21.249 --> 59:22.748
Okay.

59:26.354 --> 59:27.653
My name is Emmy,

59:27.689 --> 59:29.155
and I'm here to present to you

59:29.190 --> 59:31.524
the five criteria
someone should have

59:31.559 --> 59:34.127
before a rescue dog picks them
to be their new best friend.

59:34.162 --> 59:35.528
First...

59:37.432 --> 59:38.464
Kindness.

59:38.500 --> 59:41.667
I'm very kind to everyone,
especially to puppies,

59:41.703 --> 59:44.704
and especially to Otter.

59:44.739 --> 59:47.773
Even when he grows up,
I'll always be nice to him.

59:49.210 --> 59:50.977
Next...

59:51.012 --> 59:52.545
smarts.

59:52.580 --> 59:54.080
I'm really good at school,

59:54.115 --> 59:55.915
which means I'll be able
to learn all about

59:55.950 --> 59:57.483
how to care for a new puppy,

59:57.519 --> 59:59.685
and I'm going train him to sit,

59:59.721 --> 01:00:00.820
to stay,

01:00:00.855 --> 01:00:02.135
and to not chew
my daddy's shoes.

01:00:03.691 --> 01:00:05.491
Fun...

01:00:05.527 --> 01:00:08.161
We are going to have
so much fun together.

01:00:08.196 --> 01:00:10.096
I'm going to take him
on walks every day

01:00:10.131 --> 01:00:12.298
and throw him a ball
anytime he wants.

01:00:16.204 --> 01:00:17.904
Finally, love...

01:00:17.939 --> 01:00:20.017
I'm going to love him
more than anything in the world,

01:00:20.041 --> 01:00:21.240
except my dad,

01:00:21.276 --> 01:00:23.409
and that's why
I want to get a puppy

01:00:23.444 --> 01:00:26.546
and why I'll live up to my end
of the bargain.

01:00:27.448 --> 01:00:29.048
Thank you.

01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:35.588
I knew I shouldn't
have left you two alone.

01:00:35.623 --> 01:00:37.023
I found it very persuasive.

01:00:37.058 --> 01:00:38.558
I bet you did.

01:00:38.593 --> 01:00:39.825
So did I.

01:00:40.995 --> 01:00:42.762
I'll tell you what.

01:00:44.432 --> 01:00:46.399
Having these puppies
here with us for a few days

01:00:46.434 --> 01:00:48.234
will be a good test.

01:00:48.269 --> 01:00:51.637
It's a lot of work,
lots of responsibility...

01:00:51.673 --> 01:00:54.974
If you can show me
you can handle it,

01:00:55.009 --> 01:00:56.375
I'll be inclined to say yes.

01:00:56.411 --> 01:00:58.277
Thank you, Daddy.

01:01:05.987 --> 01:01:08.955
Did you really like it, Daddy?

01:01:08.990 --> 01:01:10.957
It was great.

01:01:12.694 --> 01:01:14.227
You know...

01:01:14.262 --> 01:01:16.095
us not getting a dog
isn't because

01:01:16.130 --> 01:01:18.297
I think you wouldn't
take great care of him.

01:01:18.333 --> 01:01:20.099
I know you would.

01:01:20.134 --> 01:01:21.601
This might sound silly,

01:01:21.636 --> 01:01:23.936
but it's just been
me and you for a while,

01:01:23.972 --> 01:01:25.471
and maybe there's a part of me

01:01:25.506 --> 01:01:27.451
that just doesn't want
to share you with anyone else.

01:01:27.475 --> 01:01:31.244
But maybe it's time
our family gets bigger.

01:01:31.279 --> 01:01:32.979
I think it is,

01:01:33.014 --> 01:01:34.792
and I think Otter would
make a great addition.

01:01:34.816 --> 01:01:36.649
He will.

01:01:36.684 --> 01:01:39.952
Maybe Hailey, too.

01:01:39.988 --> 01:01:41.187
What makes you say that?

01:01:41.222 --> 01:01:42.822
Because!

01:01:42.857 --> 01:01:45.658
She's smart and nice.

01:01:45.693 --> 01:01:48.794
She makes you smile, Daddy.

01:01:50.665 --> 01:01:52.164
I love you, sweetie.

01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:53.766
I love you, too.

01:02:10.485 --> 01:02:12.518
And she's out.

01:02:12.553 --> 01:02:14.320
Puppies are, too.

01:02:14.355 --> 01:02:15.688
Really?

01:02:15.723 --> 01:02:16.522
Yeah. I mean, at this age,

01:02:16.557 --> 01:02:19.258
that's kind of
all they do, really.

01:02:20.662 --> 01:02:22.361
That was a sweet thing
you did with Emmy...

01:02:22.397 --> 01:02:24.297
the presentation.

01:02:24.332 --> 01:02:26.832
I hope I didn't
put you on the spot.

01:02:28.369 --> 01:02:30.736
Sometimes, I need a little push
to make me realize

01:02:30.772 --> 01:02:33.873
that I might be missing out
on a moment.

01:02:35.510 --> 01:02:38.477
Well, moments can pass you by
if you don't recognize them.

01:02:38.513 --> 01:02:40.646
That's true.

01:02:45.386 --> 01:02:47.386
Wait. Where'd Otter go?

01:02:47.422 --> 01:02:49.522
I have a pretty good idea.

01:02:49.557 --> 01:02:52.058
Okay.

01:02:52.093 --> 01:02:54.527
It's okay, Otter.

01:02:54.562 --> 01:02:56.595
I'm right here.

01:02:56.631 --> 01:02:58.264
Come on.

01:02:58.299 --> 01:03:00.199
You can sleep with me tonight.

01:03:05.807 --> 01:03:08.240
It's getting late,
so I should probably go.

01:03:09.577 --> 01:03:12.011
Hey, maybe Emmy can help me
at my next party.

01:03:12.046 --> 01:03:14.513
Yeah. I'd have
to chaperone her, of course.

01:03:14.549 --> 01:03:16.415
Yeah, of course.

01:03:16.451 --> 01:03:17.783
I'll, I'll send you the info.

01:03:17.819 --> 01:03:19.755
- Great.
- Great.

01:03:20.321 --> 01:03:21.587
Thanks for this today.

01:03:21.622 --> 01:03:23.589
No, thank you.

01:03:25.259 --> 01:03:27.193
Bye.

01:03:27.228 --> 01:03:28.894
Goodnight.

01:03:50.585 --> 01:03:52.418
Who knew setting up
an engagement party

01:03:52.454 --> 01:03:54.020
would be so much work?

01:03:54.055 --> 01:03:57.423
Every bride
who ever got married?

01:03:57.459 --> 01:03:58.591
Well, I wouldn't know,

01:03:58.627 --> 01:04:00.059
but maybe this afternoon,

01:04:00.095 --> 01:04:02.095
some of these dogs
will find their forever home,

01:04:02.130 --> 01:04:04.631
and I'll find my future husband.

01:04:04.666 --> 01:04:07.233
Okay, maybe you will.

01:04:07.269 --> 01:04:09.135
Speaking of future husbands,

01:04:09.170 --> 01:04:10.937
how is our smoke-show dad?

01:04:10.972 --> 01:04:12.472
Would you stop calling him that?

01:04:12.507 --> 01:04:13.873
He is a catch, Hailey.

01:04:13.909 --> 01:04:16.409
I mean, the man
is going out of his way for you.

01:04:16.444 --> 01:04:18.278
With the puppies.
I know.

01:04:18.313 --> 01:04:19.913
But he insisted.

01:04:19.948 --> 01:04:21.748
Well, I think it's noble.

01:04:21.783 --> 01:04:23.483
I mean, these dogs
have nowhere to go.

01:04:23.518 --> 01:04:25.585
The shelters are full.

01:04:25.620 --> 01:04:27.553
They'd be homeless.

01:04:27.589 --> 01:04:30.423
I know. He's so perfect.

01:04:30.458 --> 01:04:32.759
A perfect match for you,
that is.

01:04:32.794 --> 01:04:34.928
Okay. I like him, Dana.

01:04:34.963 --> 01:04:37.330
I like him a lot...

01:04:37.365 --> 01:04:40.500
so much, it scares me sometimes.

01:04:40.535 --> 01:04:42.835
Look, I know you've had
your heart broken before,

01:04:42.871 --> 01:04:45.571
but you can't keep
living in the past.

01:04:45.607 --> 01:04:47.507
Yeah, I know,

01:04:47.542 --> 01:04:48.942
but I just, I don't really know

01:04:48.977 --> 01:04:51.277
if he's ready for
a relationship, you know?

01:04:51.313 --> 01:04:53.012
He's been through a lot
with the loss,

01:04:53.048 --> 01:04:54.681
and now he's a single dad,

01:04:54.716 --> 01:04:57.083
and his life is really full.

01:04:57.118 --> 01:05:01.387
You just spent an entire day
with a man and his daughter.

01:05:02.490 --> 01:05:03.656
From what you tell me,

01:05:03.692 --> 01:05:06.993
it sounds like his life wouldn't
be full without you in it.

01:05:12.334 --> 01:05:16.202
Okay, we have three hours
until the party.

01:05:16.237 --> 01:05:17.870
You, my friend,
need to get home.

01:05:17.906 --> 01:05:19.706
Our Puppy Party Playdates shirts

01:05:19.741 --> 01:05:22.342
are officially banned from
this afternoon's festivities.

01:05:22.377 --> 01:05:23.309
You're getting your hair up,

01:05:23.345 --> 01:05:24.444
dress on,

01:05:24.479 --> 01:05:26.846
best paw forward.

01:05:26.881 --> 01:05:28.014
- Let's go!
- Okay.

01:05:39.328 --> 01:05:40.627
You are so cute.

01:05:40.662 --> 01:05:42.395
You're adorable.

01:05:42.431 --> 01:05:43.496
And all available,

01:05:43.532 --> 01:05:46.266
as well as the many adult dogs
we have in the back.

01:05:46.301 --> 01:05:47.612
I was just gonna take
a tour in the back room.

01:05:47.636 --> 01:05:48.468
Thanks so much.

01:05:48.503 --> 01:05:50.737
No problem.

01:05:52.541 --> 01:05:54.841
Don't you look dapper.

01:05:54.876 --> 01:05:56.576
Thank you.

01:05:56.612 --> 01:05:59.079
Where's Hailey?
I haven't seen her yet.

01:05:59.114 --> 01:06:01.281
She's around here somewhere.

01:06:01.316 --> 01:06:03.316
There she is.

01:06:10.892 --> 01:06:12.826
What?

01:06:12.861 --> 01:06:16.096
You...
you look great.

01:06:17.165 --> 01:06:18.431
Thanks.

01:06:19.501 --> 01:06:20.533
So I'm gonna go

01:06:20.569 --> 01:06:23.003
check to see how Emmy's
doing with the puppies.

01:06:24.139 --> 01:06:26.072
Yeah.

01:06:29.211 --> 01:06:30.944
So how's it going?

01:06:30.979 --> 01:06:32.112
Any takers?

01:06:32.147 --> 01:06:33.157
Going to be like
fish in a barrel.

01:06:33.181 --> 01:06:34.347
I hope so.

01:06:34.383 --> 01:06:36.616
Hey, Dad.
What are you doing here?

01:06:36.652 --> 01:06:38.612
Well, I am friends
with the cute couple, aren't I?

01:06:39.554 --> 01:06:41.065
I also happen to be friends
with the bride's grandfather.

01:06:41.089 --> 01:06:42.789
There he is.

01:06:42.824 --> 01:06:43.657
Fred?

01:06:43.692 --> 01:06:45.125
Hi!

01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:47.994
I... I didn't realize
you were Katie's granddad.

01:06:48.030 --> 01:06:50.363
Well, now you do.

01:06:51.700 --> 01:06:52.866
Well...

01:06:52.901 --> 01:06:54.261
I'm gonna go
get myself a lemonade.

01:06:55.570 --> 01:06:56.970
What was that all about?

01:06:57.005 --> 01:06:59.239
He's the one who called
the city on my business.

01:06:59.274 --> 01:07:00.640
Fred?

01:07:00.676 --> 01:07:02.709
That old grump.

01:07:02.744 --> 01:07:04.577
I'll have to have
a talk with him.

01:07:04.613 --> 01:07:05.812
Thanks.

01:07:05.847 --> 01:07:06.980
You must be Ryan?

01:07:07.015 --> 01:07:08.348
I am. Nice to meet you,
Mr. Goode.

01:07:08.383 --> 01:07:10.250
- Call me Wade.
- All right.

01:07:10.285 --> 01:07:11.551
Ryan, what's the difference

01:07:11.586 --> 01:07:12.930
between an accountant
and a lawyer?

01:07:12.954 --> 01:07:13.987
Dad...

01:07:14.022 --> 01:07:15.555
I don't know.

01:07:15.590 --> 01:07:17.657
An accountant knows he's boring.

01:07:20.062 --> 01:07:21.062
I'll go talk to Fred.

01:07:21.096 --> 01:07:22.762
Okay. Thanks, Dad.

01:07:22.798 --> 01:07:23.841
Ryan, see you again, I hope.

01:07:23.865 --> 01:07:25.231
Yeah.

01:07:25.267 --> 01:07:26.366
He really likes you.

01:07:26.401 --> 01:07:27.867
How do you know?

01:07:27.903 --> 01:07:29.936
He only tells really bad jokes
to people he likes.

01:07:29.971 --> 01:07:31.404
Then he must really like me.

01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:32.560
I think you're his favorite.

01:07:33.709 --> 01:07:35.575
Come on, this way.

01:07:42.584 --> 01:07:45.051
Hi. What's your name?

01:07:45.087 --> 01:07:46.519
- Roxanne.
- Hello, Roxanne.

01:07:46.555 --> 01:07:48.088
I'm Mr. Blue,

01:07:48.123 --> 01:07:50.090
and I've been looking
all over for you.

01:07:58.300 --> 01:08:00.445
All of the adoptions are done
through this animal shelter

01:08:00.469 --> 01:08:01.579
with Dana,
and they'll contact you.

01:08:01.603 --> 01:08:04.871
You'll fill out all the forms,
they'll do an interview,

01:08:04.906 --> 01:08:06.551
and if they think that
you're a suitable forever home,

01:08:06.575 --> 01:08:07.407
then you get to take the dog
home with you.

01:08:07.442 --> 01:08:09.209
Great. Can I go
see him in the back?

01:08:09.244 --> 01:08:10.076
Yeah, sure.

01:08:10.112 --> 01:08:12.045
Thanks.

01:08:14.149 --> 01:08:15.482
Hi.

01:08:15.517 --> 01:08:17.149
The puppies are going fast.

01:08:17.185 --> 01:08:19.285
We need to initiate
"Operation Otter"

01:08:19.321 --> 01:08:20.920
before someone snatches him up.

01:08:20.956 --> 01:08:22.287
"Operation Otter"?

01:08:22.323 --> 01:08:25.591
My dad has basically said yes
to Otter already,

01:08:25.627 --> 01:08:27.727
but I just need to push him
over the top.

01:08:28.930 --> 01:08:29.962
So...

01:08:29.997 --> 01:08:31.831
"Mickey Mouse".

01:08:31.867 --> 01:08:33.099
What's that?

01:08:33.135 --> 01:08:36.402
A person we need to make up
that's looking for a new puppy.

01:08:36.438 --> 01:08:38.071
That's a really good idea,

01:08:38.106 --> 01:08:40.140
but maybe we should go
with a name

01:08:40.175 --> 01:08:41.941
that's a little less suspicious.

01:08:41.977 --> 01:08:43.176
"Amber Dunlap", then.

01:08:43.211 --> 01:08:44.911
She's my best friend in school.

01:08:44.946 --> 01:08:46.157
Yep, that's
much less suspicious.

01:08:46.180 --> 01:08:47.147
Here you go.

01:08:47.182 --> 01:08:49.515
All right.

01:08:49.551 --> 01:08:53.319
"Operation Amber Dunlap",
aka "Mickey Mouse",

01:08:53.354 --> 01:08:54.287
is underway.

01:08:54.322 --> 01:08:55.255
You ready?

01:08:55.290 --> 01:08:57.290
Your dad's over there.
Let's call him over.

01:08:57.325 --> 01:08:58.758
Daddy!

01:09:01.863 --> 01:09:03.129
What's up?

01:09:03.165 --> 01:09:04.264
Look.

01:09:04.299 --> 01:09:05.965
Someone wants to adopt Otter.

01:09:06.001 --> 01:09:07.533
Come on.

01:09:07.569 --> 01:09:09.702
Yeah, well, you know
I can't protect him.

01:09:09.738 --> 01:09:11.604
Unless I agree right here
and now to adopt him.

01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:12.604
Is that correct?

01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:14.207
I'm afraid so.

01:09:14.242 --> 01:09:15.675
Daddy...

01:09:15.710 --> 01:09:18.144
I'm thinking.

01:09:25.886 --> 01:09:27.287
All right.

01:09:28.523 --> 01:09:29.956
- Is that a yes?
- Yes.

01:09:29.991 --> 01:09:30.991
Thank you, Daddy!

01:09:33.662 --> 01:09:34.627
So what's the next step?

01:09:34.662 --> 01:09:36.830
You just have to fill out
the adoption forms,

01:09:36.865 --> 01:09:38.231
because, you know, otherwise,

01:09:38.265 --> 01:09:41.000
this Amber Dunlap's
gonna beat you to it.

01:09:41.036 --> 01:09:42.535
Done and done.

01:09:42.571 --> 01:09:43.803
Can I go tell Otter?

01:09:43.839 --> 01:09:44.970
Of course.

01:09:46.608 --> 01:09:48.006
Thank you.

01:09:48.042 --> 01:09:49.042
Yeah, well, you know,

01:09:49.077 --> 01:09:51.211
I knew all the dogs
were gonna go really fast.

01:09:51.246 --> 01:09:52.712
Amber Dunlap, huh?

01:09:52.747 --> 01:09:54.080
She was really serious.

01:09:54.115 --> 01:09:55.815
Maybe I should talk to her,

01:09:55.851 --> 01:09:57.217
just to let her know
the situation.

01:09:57.252 --> 01:09:58.351
You know, I think she left.

01:09:58.386 --> 01:09:59.419
- Right.
- She was just...

01:09:59.454 --> 01:10:02.088
She was coming after Otter,
though, any minute.

01:10:02.123 --> 01:10:03.823
Yeah?

01:10:03.859 --> 01:10:05.725
She's a "YouTuber".

01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:06.904
You know, don't
pay attention to that.

01:10:06.928 --> 01:10:08.728
No?

01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:28.348
She likes you.

01:10:29.584 --> 01:10:31.684
I'm sure she's that way
with everyone.

01:10:34.089 --> 01:10:36.522
I haven't seen her
that way with anyone.

01:10:37.759 --> 01:10:39.826
How long's she been
in the shelter?

01:10:39.861 --> 01:10:42.562
Over a year.

01:10:42.597 --> 01:10:44.631
She was treated poorly
by negligent owners

01:10:44.666 --> 01:10:47.066
and called in
by a concerned neighbor.

01:10:48.370 --> 01:10:50.837
Anyhow, we nursed her
back to health,

01:10:50.872 --> 01:10:53.940
and now she's desperately
looking for a home.

01:10:57.145 --> 01:10:59.445
You think maybe I could
take her for a walk tomorrow?

01:11:01.149 --> 01:11:03.316
Absolutely.

01:11:04.819 --> 01:11:06.753
Here you go.

01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:14.293
Thanks. Have a good night.

01:11:14.329 --> 01:11:15.494
Hey.

01:11:15.530 --> 01:11:17.129
Where are Emmy and Dana?

01:11:17.165 --> 01:11:18.798
Dana offered to take Emmy home.

01:11:18.833 --> 01:11:20.733
She could hardly
keep her eyes open.

01:11:20.768 --> 01:11:23.502
She also suggested I stay
and help you clean up.

01:11:23.538 --> 01:11:24.737
Oh, she did, did she?

01:11:24.772 --> 01:11:27.406
They both did, actually.

01:11:27.442 --> 01:11:28.641
Need some help?

01:11:28.676 --> 01:11:30.576
Yeah, sure. Thanks.

01:11:31.779 --> 01:11:33.746
Quite the night.

01:11:33.781 --> 01:11:35.159
I think even
your "friendly" neighbor

01:11:35.183 --> 01:11:36.749
found a soft spot in his heart.

01:11:36.784 --> 01:11:39.051
Yeah! I know, right?
Who would've thought?

01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:46.460
So...

01:11:46.494 --> 01:11:48.461
good with dogs,

01:11:48.496 --> 01:11:50.930
but the real question is...

01:11:50.965 --> 01:11:52.698
Can you dance?

01:11:52.734 --> 01:11:53.966
Right now?

01:11:54.002 --> 01:11:54.934
You're too shy?

01:11:54.969 --> 01:11:57.436
Because you don't strike me
as a shy type.

01:12:59.100 --> 01:13:02.068
Emmy's waiting.
I guess...

01:13:05.573 --> 01:13:07.273
You should go.

01:13:07.308 --> 01:13:09.809
Yeah. Okay.

01:13:26.561 --> 01:13:28.160
Thanks.

01:13:28.196 --> 01:13:29.662
Everything okay?

01:13:29.697 --> 01:13:31.997
Yeah.

01:13:32.033 --> 01:13:33.666
It's just...

01:13:33.701 --> 01:13:34.734
It's...

01:13:34.769 --> 01:13:35.769
It's nothing.

01:13:37.538 --> 01:13:39.038
Ryan?

01:13:39.073 --> 01:13:40.673
Yeah, I just...
I don't know what it is.

01:13:40.708 --> 01:13:42.675
It's like one minute, you know,

01:13:42.710 --> 01:13:44.744
I feel like
there's something there,

01:13:44.779 --> 01:13:49.215
and then the next minute,
he's hesitant and distant.

01:13:50.585 --> 01:13:53.219
Which is natural,
especially in his situation.

01:13:53.254 --> 01:13:55.087
Right. Yeah.

01:13:55.123 --> 01:13:57.022
Yeah, you're right.

01:13:57.058 --> 01:13:58.858
Be patient with him.

01:13:58.893 --> 01:14:00.393
Whatcha working on?

01:14:00.428 --> 01:14:03.362
A new proposal
to fund the dog sanctuary.

01:14:03.398 --> 01:14:05.731
If I can't figure out
a way to buy this land,

01:14:05.767 --> 01:14:07.733
then I'm back to square one.

01:14:07.769 --> 01:14:10.102
It'll take more than
just a fundraiser, won't it?

01:14:10.138 --> 01:14:11.670
Yeah, a lot more.

01:14:13.174 --> 01:14:14.974
Did the rest of the puppies
get adopted?

01:14:15.009 --> 01:14:16.809
Almost.

01:14:16.844 --> 01:14:18.811
Dana's interviewing
potential new owners now,

01:14:18.846 --> 01:14:22.148
so I should probably
go help her.

01:14:22.183 --> 01:14:23.382
I'll be back this afternoon

01:14:23.418 --> 01:14:25.317
to finish
the Lily returns, okay?

01:14:25.353 --> 01:14:27.119
I'm all covered here.
Do what you need to do.

01:14:27.155 --> 01:14:29.288
Thanks, Dad.

01:14:30.625 --> 01:14:32.403
- Good morning, Hailey.
- Good morning, Mr. Hennessy.

01:14:32.427 --> 01:14:34.827
Hey there, Dave. Everything
all right with the returns?

01:14:34.862 --> 01:14:35.828
Of course.

01:14:35.863 --> 01:14:37.963
I actually wanted to pop by
and chat with you

01:14:37.999 --> 01:14:40.099
about the grant I mentioned
last time I was in.

01:14:40.134 --> 01:14:41.033
Yeah, right.
Have a seat.

01:14:41.068 --> 01:14:43.669
Did you decide
on a recipient for it yet?

01:14:43.704 --> 01:14:46.605
No, we haven't found
the right fit yet.

01:14:46.641 --> 01:14:49.175
How did it work out
for her with the signatures?

01:14:49.210 --> 01:14:50.843
Did they get
the Bryant Street land?

01:14:50.878 --> 01:14:53.112
No, but something else
actually opened up

01:14:53.147 --> 01:14:55.514
that's even better
than Bryant Street...

01:14:55.550 --> 01:14:57.650
an animal sanctuary.

01:14:57.685 --> 01:14:58.984
All that's needed now

01:14:59.020 --> 01:15:00.519
is the funds
to purchase the land.

01:15:00.555 --> 01:15:02.588
Is that so?

01:15:09.330 --> 01:15:10.330
Hey.

01:15:12.533 --> 01:15:14.166
Ry?

01:15:14.202 --> 01:15:17.203
Looks like you were deep
in thought with something.

01:15:17.238 --> 01:15:18.238
I was just thinking.

01:15:21.209 --> 01:15:22.708
Does she know?

01:15:22.743 --> 01:15:24.310
Who?

01:15:24.345 --> 01:15:26.145
Hailey.

01:15:26.180 --> 01:15:28.047
What do you mean?

01:15:28.082 --> 01:15:30.316
I mean that you have
feelings for her.

01:15:33.254 --> 01:15:35.154
I don't think
that's going anywhere.

01:15:36.324 --> 01:15:37.389
You once told me

01:15:37.425 --> 01:15:39.658
that you never wanted
to get serious with someone

01:15:39.694 --> 01:15:41.360
because of Emmy,

01:15:41.395 --> 01:15:43.062
that she was your everything.

01:15:43.097 --> 01:15:45.164
And she is my everything.

01:15:45.199 --> 01:15:46.232
Yeah...

01:15:46.267 --> 01:15:47.267
but that doesn't mean

01:15:47.301 --> 01:15:50.436
that she has to be
your only everything, Ryan.

01:15:52.340 --> 01:15:54.240
- Go make her smile.
- What's this?

01:15:54.275 --> 01:15:57.376
Just a little email
that I received today.

01:15:57.411 --> 01:15:59.712
The animal sanctuary
she's proposing?

01:15:59.747 --> 01:16:01.180
Looks like it got funded.

01:16:01.215 --> 01:16:02.982
Ha!

01:16:06.354 --> 01:16:08.921
So it's official?
It's funded?

01:16:08.956 --> 01:16:11.223
All of it,
and approved by the city.

01:16:11.259 --> 01:16:13.359
Hailey is gonna cry!

01:16:13.394 --> 01:16:15.361
This has been her dream
for so long.

01:16:15.396 --> 01:16:16.840
We thought it'd be fun
to surprise her

01:16:16.864 --> 01:16:17.897
and tell her here.

01:16:17.932 --> 01:16:19.109
Well, what did you have in mind?

01:16:19.133 --> 01:16:20.866
What else?
A puppy party.

01:16:20.902 --> 01:16:23.435
Awesome.

01:16:23.471 --> 01:16:26.205
Wait, maybe you can tell her
that you found a new client,

01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:27.439
with a last-minute request.

01:16:27.475 --> 01:16:28.307
All right.

01:16:28.342 --> 01:16:30.209
And Dana,
you'll have to convince her

01:16:30.244 --> 01:16:32.022
to bring the puppies here,
even though it's short notice.

01:16:32.046 --> 01:16:33.046
Good idea.

01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:34.146
And the barn here

01:16:34.181 --> 01:16:37.216
has really been a sanctuary
to Hailey, in many ways.

01:16:38.486 --> 01:16:39.963
I think we should have her
meet us there.

01:16:39.987 --> 01:16:41.887
Well, she's at the shelter,

01:16:41.923 --> 01:16:44.623
so I'll go there
and wait for Wade's call.

01:16:44.659 --> 01:16:45.624
Got it.

01:16:45.660 --> 01:16:46.559
Great.

01:16:46.594 --> 01:16:48.594
Awesome!

01:16:51.933 --> 01:16:53.098
Congratulations.

01:16:53.134 --> 01:16:55.200
Happy home forever, little guy.

01:16:55.236 --> 01:16:56.402
Good luck with her.

01:16:56.437 --> 01:16:57.437
Thanks so much.

01:16:58.339 --> 01:17:00.205
Bye.

01:17:00.241 --> 01:17:02.274
Puppy Party Playdates,
this is...

01:17:02.310 --> 01:17:04.910
Hi, Dad.

01:17:04.946 --> 01:17:07.780
A client?

01:17:07.815 --> 01:17:10.215
Well, how did you...

01:17:10.251 --> 01:17:12.418
Yeah, sure.

01:17:12.453 --> 01:17:13.453
Let me ask.

01:17:13.487 --> 01:17:16.088
Hey, Brad, do we happen to have
a few puppies

01:17:16.123 --> 01:17:17.723
that we can use
for a last-minute party?

01:17:17.758 --> 01:17:18.624
We do,

01:17:18.659 --> 01:17:20.225
we have two little ones
left from Mia,

01:17:20.261 --> 01:17:22.261
plus I think
we have about five more.

01:17:22.296 --> 01:17:23.596
Okay.

01:17:23.631 --> 01:17:26.065
Yeah, we can make that work.

01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:28.801
Today?

01:17:28.836 --> 01:17:30.469
At the barn?

01:17:30.504 --> 01:17:32.304
Yeah.

01:17:32.340 --> 01:17:34.406
Yeah, sure, that's fine.

01:17:34.442 --> 01:17:36.742
Dana and I will meet you
over there.

01:17:36.777 --> 01:17:37.843
Okay.

01:17:37.878 --> 01:17:39.178
Sure. Bye.

01:17:39.213 --> 01:17:40.846
Hey, that is so weird.

01:17:40.881 --> 01:17:43.115
My dad just got a booking
for us from a client,

01:17:43.150 --> 01:17:45.195
and they want us to meet them
at the barn, of all places.

01:17:45.219 --> 01:17:47.419
We could do that, right?

01:17:47.455 --> 01:17:50.723
Yeah, I just... I didn't know
anyone knew about that place.

01:17:50.758 --> 01:17:53.292
The Puppy Party Playdates
shirts are in the wash,

01:17:53.327 --> 01:17:54.293
so we should just wear this.

01:17:54.328 --> 01:17:55.961
Wait, is that...

01:17:55.997 --> 01:17:57.129
A stain?

01:17:57.164 --> 01:17:58.330
That's a stain.

01:17:58.366 --> 01:18:00.132
Yeah, we should
probably change, then.

01:18:00.167 --> 01:18:01.500
Better get going.

01:18:02.703 --> 01:18:04.436
I don't see a stain.

01:18:11.912 --> 01:18:13.912
Ryan?

01:18:13.948 --> 01:18:16.015
Emmy, Dad...

01:18:16.050 --> 01:18:18.083
What's going on?

01:18:18.119 --> 01:18:21.587
Miss Hailey Goode,
may I present to you...

01:18:21.622 --> 01:18:22.988
...Your new rescue sanctuary.

01:18:24.725 --> 01:18:26.659
Recipient of the Hennessy Grant.

01:18:26.694 --> 01:18:28.727
What?

01:18:28.763 --> 01:18:30.329
It's all completely funded.

01:18:30.364 --> 01:18:32.331
Congratulations, honey.

01:18:32.366 --> 01:18:34.566
I...

01:18:36.037 --> 01:18:38.904
I don't understand.
I...

01:18:38.939 --> 01:18:41.540
Is this supposed to be
some sort of joke?

01:18:41.575 --> 01:18:42.619
Please tell me
this isn't a joke.

01:18:42.643 --> 01:18:43.676
It's not.

01:18:43.711 --> 01:18:44.943
The city's approved it.

01:18:44.979 --> 01:18:47.312
I can't believe it.

01:18:49.283 --> 01:18:50.416
There's something else.

01:18:50.451 --> 01:18:51.617
What?

01:18:51.652 --> 01:18:53.285
Something I want to tell you.

01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:56.188
Something I should have
told you already.

01:18:56.223 --> 01:18:58.724
I'm all ears.

01:18:58.759 --> 01:19:00.459
So here it goes.

01:19:02.229 --> 01:19:06.799
If I were a singer,
I would've put it in a song.

01:19:06.834 --> 01:19:10.202
If I were a writer,
it'd be a poem...

01:19:10.237 --> 01:19:12.104
but I'm a city planner,

01:19:12.139 --> 01:19:14.473
and I present things to people

01:19:14.508 --> 01:19:16.308
in order to sway their opinion
in my favor.

01:19:16.343 --> 01:19:18.077
So...

01:19:18.112 --> 01:19:20.312
You told me

01:19:20.347 --> 01:19:22.915
that we don't choose
a rescue animal,

01:19:22.950 --> 01:19:25.317
they choose us...

01:19:25.352 --> 01:19:27.720
but in order for them
to choose us,

01:19:27.755 --> 01:19:29.888
there's five things
we need to possess.

01:19:33.461 --> 01:19:35.661
You're the kindest
person I know.

01:19:35.696 --> 01:19:37.396
You would do anything for anyone

01:19:37.431 --> 01:19:39.631
without ever considering
what's in it for yourself.

01:19:40.868 --> 01:19:42.279
You didn't start
Puppy Party Playdates

01:19:42.303 --> 01:19:43.469
to make money.

01:19:43.504 --> 01:19:44.903
You did it
to better the world...

01:19:44.939 --> 01:19:46.772
and people's lives...

01:19:46.807 --> 01:19:48.273
dogs' lives...

01:19:48.309 --> 01:19:49.608
and you have.

01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:54.980
Smarts...

01:19:55.015 --> 01:19:56.915
You have a successful
part-time business

01:19:56.951 --> 01:19:58.595
that would be more than most
people could handle full-time,

01:19:58.619 --> 01:20:00.252
<i>and...</i>

01:20:00.287 --> 01:20:02.788
you know the difference between
melt-in-your-mouth cookies

01:20:02.823 --> 01:20:04.690
and ones that...

01:20:04.725 --> 01:20:06.325
don't.

01:20:09.497 --> 01:20:10.462
Fun.

01:20:10.498 --> 01:20:13.499
You have a sweet laugh
and a beautiful smile.

01:20:13.534 --> 01:20:15.334
You find humor
in almost everything,

01:20:15.369 --> 01:20:17.302
especially when
it's needed most.

01:20:17.338 --> 01:20:18.604
It's infectious...

01:20:18.639 --> 01:20:19.838
and adorable.

01:20:21.542 --> 01:20:24.276
Honesty is hard to come by,

01:20:24.311 --> 01:20:26.011
and trust is hard,

01:20:26.046 --> 01:20:28.514
especially when
you've experienced loss...

01:20:28.549 --> 01:20:30.616
especially when
you have a daughter

01:20:30.651 --> 01:20:32.117
who means everything...

01:20:32.153 --> 01:20:34.353
but sometimes...

01:20:34.388 --> 01:20:37.055
you have to trust
your heart more than anything.

01:20:37.091 --> 01:20:38.791
Follow your heart
and you never know

01:20:38.826 --> 01:20:40.359
where it might lead you...

01:20:41.662 --> 01:20:44.363
And it's led me to this moment,

01:20:44.398 --> 01:20:45.964
this now,

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:49.401
saying these words to someone
who isn't complicated,

01:20:49.436 --> 01:20:50.669
just...

01:20:50.704 --> 01:20:51.870
perfect...

01:20:54.608 --> 01:20:56.008
And lastly,

01:20:56.043 --> 01:20:58.343
the person has to be loving,

01:20:58.379 --> 01:21:02.047
and I don't think there's anyone
else in the whole world

01:21:02.082 --> 01:21:03.402
with more love
to give than you...

01:21:04.718 --> 01:21:06.318
And it's because of that,

01:21:06.353 --> 01:21:09.254
I wouldn't want to be rescued
by anyone else.

01:21:09.290 --> 01:21:11.256
Me neither.

01:21:13.794 --> 01:21:16.395
It might be too much, too soon,

01:21:16.430 --> 01:21:18.363
but...

01:21:18.399 --> 01:21:21.233
I'm gonna go out on a limb here,

01:21:21.268 --> 01:21:23.702
live in the now, the present,

01:21:23.737 --> 01:21:25.804
and say...

01:21:27.141 --> 01:21:30.242
I think I've fallen in love
with you, Hailey Goode.

01:21:31.879 --> 01:21:33.846
Well...

01:21:33.881 --> 01:21:35.514
that's good,

01:21:35.549 --> 01:21:38.517
because I think I've fallen
in love with you, Ryan Hill.

01:21:50.664 --> 01:21:52.297
You should probably
kiss me again,

01:21:52.333 --> 01:21:54.350
just to be sure.
