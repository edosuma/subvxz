03:17.500 --> 03:18.760
Some fun tonight?

03:20.740 --> 03:21.730
Come.

03:40.660 --> 03:42.850
What would you like to drink?

03:44.360 --> 03:45.620
This way.

04:03.980 --> 04:05.450
Hello.

04:10.390 --> 04:11.690
You are...

04:13.790 --> 04:16.230
Young At Heart 69.

04:20.899 --> 04:21.920
Password?

04:22.000 --> 04:23.230
Purity.

04:24.540 --> 04:25.730
Shut up.

04:25.800 --> 04:27.330
He's a paying customer.

04:30.010 --> 04:31.640
Sit down, please.

04:33.980 --> 04:35.840
Do you have the money?

04:37.850 --> 04:38.940
Yeah.

04:41.120 --> 04:43.210
Can I see your Sasha first?

04:45.760 --> 04:46.850
You don't trust me?

04:49.560 --> 04:51.960
It's a lot of money for one hour.

05:02.370 --> 05:04.600
Your first time in my country?

05:08.010 --> 05:09.780
You don't talk much.

05:10.280 --> 05:12.080
Makes me a little nervous.

05:14.650 --> 05:16.780
You want to make me nervous?

05:16.950 --> 05:18.350
Oh, no.

05:18.760 --> 05:20.120
No.

05:21.430 --> 05:23.690
"No." That's good.

05:24.300 --> 05:26.200
- "No."
- No.

05:30.640 --> 05:32.130
Sasha.

05:32.740 --> 05:34.400
He's a good boy.

05:37.380 --> 05:39.370
Speaks English, a little.

05:41.850 --> 05:43.110
One hour.

06:02.830 --> 06:04.060
I have friends,

06:05.440 --> 06:06.870
friends all over the world,

06:07.410 --> 06:10.810
even in that little bastard's shit village.

06:11.080 --> 06:15.030
And my friend there just called
to tell me that Sasha's mother

06:15.110 --> 06:17.670
has some rich cousin in America who has,

06:17.750 --> 06:21.120
how you say, very deep pockets.

06:22.020 --> 06:24.150
And this uncle has hired a man,

06:25.320 --> 06:27.310
a very serious man,

06:28.590 --> 06:30.560
to get the kid back.

06:32.700 --> 06:33.890
That hurts,

06:35.100 --> 06:39.130
not only my feelings,
but my reputation, my business.

06:40.070 --> 06:43.300
I just want the kid. I will pay more.

06:45.680 --> 06:49.640
I love to bargain, but we have a problem.

06:50.250 --> 06:54.280
- You've seen our faces.
- We have the same problem.

06:55.650 --> 06:57.280
You've seen mine.

08:35.650 --> 08:36.980
It's okay.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.160
I will not hurt you.

08:49.270 --> 08:51.100
Your mama sent me.

08:51.400 --> 08:53.530
Your real name is Victor, right?

08:57.070 --> 08:59.600
I'm here to take you out. We go home.

09:00.780 --> 09:02.870
You ready? Let's go.

09:04.500 --> 09:09.600
A subtitle made possible by R3V0LV3R.

09:44.190 --> 09:45.880
Come on, come on.

09:57.300 --> 09:58.360
Sit.

10:01.710 --> 10:03.500
We got a problem. No one leaves.

10:06.580 --> 10:08.550
Something's wrong. No one leaves.

10:11.250 --> 10:13.240
- You like fireworks?
- Yeah.

10:18.720 --> 10:19.780
Hey, over there!

11:16.080 --> 11:17.070
Hello?

11:17.150 --> 11:20.780
The car is waiting for you downstairs.
Get here now.

11:21.550 --> 11:24.040
- You owe me.
- What?

12:25.850 --> 12:27.650
I stuck my neck out for you.

12:28.490 --> 12:30.350
Gave you intelligence.

12:30.790 --> 12:32.150
Risked my career,

12:32.920 --> 12:34.890
the lives of my family.

12:34.990 --> 12:37.090
And this is what you do?

12:38.030 --> 12:40.390
It's what I do. I got the child out.

12:40.900 --> 12:42.300
That's good.

12:47.940 --> 12:49.600
What about this child?

12:53.010 --> 12:55.340
She was, what, 14?

12:59.520 --> 13:00.710
And her?

13:01.120 --> 13:03.420
She was nine, maybe 10.

13:10.930 --> 13:15.260
Do you know what these fuckers do
when they think they're being raided?

13:16.400 --> 13:20.060
They hide the underage girls in the walls.

13:20.270 --> 13:23.710
Then you, last night, out here blasting.

13:23.910 --> 13:26.170
The first thing they do

13:26.340 --> 13:28.940
is shove the kids in the crawl space.

13:31.720 --> 13:35.010
And then you turn the parking lot
into a fucking inferno.

13:35.250 --> 13:36.280
Well, guess what?

13:37.020 --> 13:38.820
Fire spreads.

13:44.460 --> 13:46.660
Most of them died from smoke inhalation.

13:53.870 --> 13:55.300
I know you mean well.

13:55.440 --> 13:57.270
But you're not a cop.

13:57.440 --> 13:58.910
You're a soldier.

13:58.980 --> 14:01.810
And this is not Africa or Afghanistan.

14:02.380 --> 14:05.180
You might be used to collateral damage,
but I'm not.

14:08.520 --> 14:09.820
Are you arresting me?

14:11.960 --> 14:13.220
And what?

14:14.120 --> 14:16.990
Lose my career when they start digging?

14:17.760 --> 14:18.960
Here's my advice.

14:19.160 --> 14:21.500
Leave police work to the police.

14:22.130 --> 14:25.070
Stick to what you know.
Go back to your shop.

14:51.160 --> 14:55.330
I mean, up until recently,
Moldova wasn't even a real country,

14:55.400 --> 14:57.030
it was part of the Soviet Union.

14:57.170 --> 14:59.160
So, is there like a Moldovan language?

14:59.300 --> 15:02.970
Officially, yes, but from what I read,
it's a Romanian dialect.

15:03.040 --> 15:04.670
Apparently, a lot of people
speak Russian too.

15:05.410 --> 15:07.710
Well, I just hope that
they speak some English.

15:07.850 --> 15:11.010
- Is that for us?
- Only the best for my girls.

15:11.120 --> 15:13.310
Nice. Now all we need are paparazzi.

15:13.450 --> 15:17.180
You want paparazzi?
Hold on, princess, I'll give you paparazzi.

15:18.890 --> 15:22.330
There. There, nice. There we go.

15:22.560 --> 15:25.030
- Oh, yeah, I like that.
- Okay, come on.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.860
Yeah, you are a natural.

15:28.800 --> 15:31.790
Oh, no. No photos, no photos.

15:32.370 --> 15:34.840
The lady doth protest too much.

15:36.240 --> 15:37.230
Go.

15:37.340 --> 15:40.740
That's it, that's it, perfect.
One more like that.

15:41.880 --> 15:43.850
Okay, come on, let's go.

15:44.820 --> 15:47.480
Andrew, I've been awake for 20 hours.

15:47.550 --> 15:52.010
- All right, princess, come on. Mommy's tired.
- Daddy's a Jackass.

15:52.120 --> 15:54.220
But he's our Jackass.

16:31.830 --> 16:34.490
You know, you might actually experience
the place a little better

16:34.570 --> 16:37.930
if you stopped a moment
to really look at the city

16:38.000 --> 16:39.030
with your eyes.

16:39.970 --> 16:43.100
Last week, Laurie Perkins
posted pictures from Paris.

16:43.170 --> 16:45.570
I figure I can outdo her in uniqueness,
if not in grandeur.

16:48.150 --> 16:51.310
Admit it, old people suck at technology.

16:51.480 --> 16:55.710
I land this fight, I promise you
Paris is not that far behind.

16:55.890 --> 16:57.290
Let's not worry about Paris.

16:57.350 --> 17:00.190
Let's just focus on getting
and winning this one.

17:00.490 --> 17:01.860
Yes, ma'am.

18:33.680 --> 18:34.810
Fuck!

19:15.330 --> 19:17.730
That's the guy they want you to fight?

19:18.060 --> 19:19.720
The white guy.

19:20.230 --> 19:21.560
He's good.

19:23.900 --> 19:25.270
He's a monster.

19:35.450 --> 19:37.470
Sweetheart, what's the matter?

19:37.650 --> 19:38.950
You know,

19:40.680 --> 19:42.780
I read you could earn
good money as a trainer.

19:46.260 --> 19:50.120
Oh, Becky, I'm good at what I do.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.790
Come here, let me show you something.

19:56.200 --> 19:57.330
See this guy?

19:57.430 --> 20:00.060
See how he only favors one side?

20:00.240 --> 20:02.640
Right leg, right jab, boom, boom, boom.

20:02.910 --> 20:06.500
Now, that's a weakness
his opponent is not exploiting.

20:07.440 --> 20:09.840
He's not thinking long term.

20:10.110 --> 20:11.410
And you do?

20:11.480 --> 20:12.610
You betcha.

20:12.680 --> 20:14.980
Put me in a cage with this guy,

20:15.050 --> 20:18.490
I'd take him out two rounds, easy.

20:19.620 --> 20:22.720
- I'll tickle him to death.
- Okay. I get it, I get it.

20:24.030 --> 20:25.320
You're a pro.

20:25.530 --> 20:26.790
Ready for your comeback.

20:27.830 --> 20:29.030
You betcha.

20:30.770 --> 20:31.860
Okay.

20:32.240 --> 20:36.000
Now can you use your superpowers to do
something about the wireless in this place?

20:36.070 --> 20:40.070
I'm trying to upload the pictures,
but the signal keeps dropping.

20:41.610 --> 20:42.870
Dad.

20:43.950 --> 20:47.310
Yeah, go try the balcony.
You might get a better signal.

20:47.420 --> 20:48.680
Okay.

20:48.790 --> 20:50.720
All right, I'm going to take a shower.

20:50.790 --> 20:53.350
If it's not fixed when I come down,

20:53.520 --> 20:55.580
I'll have them move us to a different room.

20:55.660 --> 20:56.820
Okay.

20:56.890 --> 20:58.050
Oh, and we need ice.

20:58.160 --> 21:00.100
Mom said she'd get some,
but she passed out.

21:00.160 --> 21:01.690
All right, well, let her sleep.

21:01.770 --> 21:03.290
We'll go downstairs
and get some later, okay?

21:03.370 --> 21:04.360
Okay.

21:17.410 --> 21:21.080
- The signal here sucks.
- Oh, yeah.

21:25.260 --> 21:28.550
It's best on the second floor,
near the ice machine.

21:30.590 --> 21:33.030
Sorry I startled you. I'm Amalia.

21:34.260 --> 21:36.890
Becky. Nice to meet you.

21:39.840 --> 21:42.500
- You here on vacation?
- Sort of.

21:43.510 --> 21:46.240
- My dad's on a business trip.
- Let me guess.

21:47.210 --> 21:48.270
A lawyer?

21:48.410 --> 21:51.010
He's a fighter, actually. MMA.

21:51.380 --> 21:52.810
You're kidding me.

21:52.880 --> 21:54.350
See, now that's cool.

21:55.720 --> 21:57.520
It has its good days.

22:01.790 --> 22:04.780
Hey, princess, how'd it
go with the internet?

22:06.300 --> 22:07.460
Becky?

22:09.430 --> 22:10.760
Becky?

22:24.550 --> 22:25.950
Becky.

22:29.820 --> 22:30.980
Becky.

22:44.430 --> 22:45.900
What's wrong?

22:46.900 --> 22:49.130
Did you let her go out by herself?

22:49.740 --> 22:51.900
What? No.

23:00.350 --> 23:03.290
You've reached Becky.
Tell me something good.

23:03.790 --> 23:06.050
Becky, will you please
come back to the room?

23:06.120 --> 23:09.390
And call me on my cell
to let me know you got this.

23:10.390 --> 23:13.020
- How long she been gone?
- I don't know, I was in the shower.

23:13.100 --> 23:15.860
Ten minutes, less. She
knows not to do this.

23:16.230 --> 23:19.260
She'll be back in a minute.
Is there an ice machine on this floor?

23:20.140 --> 23:23.200
I don't know. I'm gonna go look for her.

23:24.670 --> 23:28.340
Call me if she comes back
so that I can kill her.

23:43.330 --> 23:47.820
Excuse me. I'm looking for a 14-year-old
girl, about this high, blonde.

23:48.470 --> 23:50.460
- You seen her?
- No.

23:50.700 --> 23:52.570
Is everything all right?

23:53.540 --> 23:56.030
Yeah, it's just my daughter.
She wandered off.

23:56.140 --> 23:57.730
Is she missing?

23:57.810 --> 23:59.540
No, no, not really.

24:09.590 --> 24:10.580
- Hi.
- Hi.

24:10.650 --> 24:11.810
I'm in 846.

24:11.890 --> 24:13.860
Has my daughter been down here?

24:13.920 --> 24:16.390
- 846, Mr. Fayden?
- Yeah.

24:17.190 --> 24:18.250
That's my daughter.

24:18.400 --> 24:20.300
She was looking for ice.

24:20.400 --> 24:22.630
I haven't seen her, sorry,
but there are some ice machines...

24:22.770 --> 24:25.890
Yeah, I already checked those out.

24:25.970 --> 24:29.430
I'll ask my colleague.
I was busy with the ambulance. Sick guest.

24:29.540 --> 24:31.670
- Was that a girl?
- No, an older lady.

24:34.580 --> 24:35.910
Mr. Fayden.

24:36.210 --> 24:37.700
Is there a problem?

24:37.780 --> 24:39.250
Mr. Fayden is looking for his daughter.

24:40.420 --> 24:42.110
When did you last see her?

24:44.150 --> 24:45.250
About 30 minutes ago.

24:46.790 --> 24:49.090
So, would you like me to call security?

24:52.100 --> 24:53.490
Yes, yes, thank you.

25:02.710 --> 25:03.900
Becky.

25:13.650 --> 25:14.640
Becky!

25:16.120 --> 25:17.350
Becky.

25:17.750 --> 25:18.950
Becky.

25:20.760 --> 25:21.880
Oh. Sorry.

25:44.110 --> 25:45.880
What the hell?!

25:48.290 --> 25:51.050
I'm looking for my daughter.
Have you seen her?

25:54.520 --> 25:55.750
No. Sorry.

27:03.190 --> 27:04.420
In international news,

27:04.530 --> 27:07.000
the mysterious disappearance
of Becky Fayden,

27:07.100 --> 27:09.760
the daughter of former MMA champion
Andrew Fayden,

27:09.830 --> 27:11.630
continues to stump police.

27:12.000 --> 27:16.670
The 14-year-old American teen went missing
only a few hours after landing in Moldova

27:16.770 --> 27:18.100
on August 31st,

27:18.170 --> 27:20.770
where her father was in talks
about a comeback fight

27:20.880 --> 27:23.740
with European fight promoter
Roma Entertainment.

27:24.280 --> 27:27.270
At a press conference this morning,
Fayden and his wife Monica

27:27.420 --> 27:30.410
made an impassioned plea
for their daughter's return.

27:31.920 --> 27:36.720
We beg anyone with information on this case

27:36.790 --> 27:39.420
to please come forward.

27:40.530 --> 27:45.490
My promoter has kindly offered
a $10,000 reward for anyone

27:46.300 --> 27:49.240
with verifiable information
on Becky's whereabouts,

27:50.410 --> 27:55.400
and our friends and family
have generously doubled that offer.

27:57.410 --> 27:59.510
Becky, if you're out there,

27:59.580 --> 28:02.550
know that we're gonna find you.

28:04.090 --> 28:06.890
And we're gonna bring you home. Thank you.

28:26.810 --> 28:27.940
We're closed.

28:31.410 --> 28:34.850
We're not here to buy meat.

28:34.920 --> 28:36.580
We're looking for...

28:39.060 --> 28:40.220
Samson Gaul.

28:42.560 --> 28:43.890
He's dead.

28:47.860 --> 28:49.960
Are you sure, 'cause they
just gave us this...

28:50.100 --> 28:52.830
The man you're looking
for is no longer here.

29:01.950 --> 29:03.850
You were in the Legion.

29:04.850 --> 29:06.580
You're Samson Gaul.

29:08.890 --> 29:10.350
Sorry, ma'am. I can't help you.

29:11.290 --> 29:12.690
Look, buddy,

29:13.060 --> 29:16.820
I don't know what your problem is,
and I don't even care,

29:17.930 --> 29:20.230
we need your fucking help, man.

29:20.300 --> 29:22.060
Our daughter is missing.

29:22.170 --> 29:24.660
She's just a child.
The police say they found nothing.

29:26.740 --> 29:28.830
The cops are your best bet.

29:34.240 --> 29:38.270
Money? You want some money?
'Cause, you know, look, that's okay.

29:38.350 --> 29:40.750
It seems like everything else
in this country is for sale,

29:40.850 --> 29:45.010
so is this enough motivation?

29:47.320 --> 29:50.780
The man from the American Embassy
suggested that we talk to you.

29:55.300 --> 29:57.820
Do I look like the man who can help?

30:03.170 --> 30:06.900
Come on. It's a waste of time.

30:09.580 --> 30:11.210
Mr. Gaul, please.

30:12.920 --> 30:16.410
We were told that you
were the best at this.

30:16.490 --> 30:19.420
Look, if you want a steak, come to me.

30:21.190 --> 30:24.890
If you want to find your daughter,
go to the cops.

30:27.300 --> 30:29.890
Believe me, you're better without me.

31:26.090 --> 31:28.990
The man from the embassy,
that would be you?

31:29.060 --> 31:30.650
Who else?

31:33.030 --> 31:34.930
Since when do you babysit tourists?

31:35.000 --> 31:36.930
It's a small embassy. We all help out.

31:37.100 --> 31:40.000
Look, these people need you, all right?

31:40.140 --> 31:42.570
The cops have nothing.
The raids do nothing.

31:42.640 --> 31:44.800
The real bad guys are protected.

31:45.110 --> 31:46.630
Your friend, the inspector?

31:46.710 --> 31:49.230
Well, let's just say he's got the finesse
of a bull in a china shop.

31:49.310 --> 31:50.570
Why don't you dig around?

31:51.050 --> 31:53.740
I'm a paper pusher with security clearance.

31:53.820 --> 31:57.120
I don't have your flexibility
or your skill set.

31:58.390 --> 32:00.650
Sorry, I can't. You know I can't.

32:00.720 --> 32:02.690
The girl is 14 years old.

32:02.960 --> 32:05.290
It's been over 24 hours.

32:05.660 --> 32:08.360
Dad, she's running out of time.

32:08.430 --> 32:10.020
She needs you, all right?

32:10.430 --> 32:12.660
- Plus, you need this.
- I can't!

32:13.540 --> 32:16.900
- Stay out of it.
- Do you enjoy seeing dead people?

32:17.610 --> 32:20.080
Do you? Do you enjoy seeing dead people?

32:20.640 --> 32:24.270
Hey, if I want bullshit psychology,
I'll call your mother.

32:25.680 --> 32:29.550
Well, if you don't help people anymore,
then all you are is a goddamn butcher.

32:30.350 --> 32:32.450
Your grandpa was a butcher.

32:33.590 --> 32:35.220
People need meat.

35:02.140 --> 35:05.230
This girl, have you seen her?
She's my daughter.

35:08.410 --> 35:09.970
My name is the right money.

35:34.500 --> 35:35.600
You've seen her?

35:40.180 --> 35:41.340
Thank you.

36:40.440 --> 36:42.530
Hey, sweetie, you want to buy me a drink?

36:44.270 --> 36:47.440
- No, thanks.
- Okay.

36:50.910 --> 36:52.310
Excuse me.

36:52.520 --> 36:53.570
Yes?

36:55.450 --> 36:58.110
This girl, have you seen her?

36:59.560 --> 37:00.580
Nope.

37:01.620 --> 37:04.420
Are you sure? Take a better look.

37:06.200 --> 37:07.990
The woman outside, the gypsy lady...

37:08.130 --> 37:09.830
No such thing as gypsy lady.

37:09.930 --> 37:11.330
They're all whores.

37:11.500 --> 37:14.400
- And thieves.
- Thieving whores.

37:17.770 --> 37:18.970
Sorry, I did not see her.

37:20.210 --> 37:23.650
Why would the lady outside
say that she saw her?

37:23.750 --> 37:27.200
Mister, that gypsy witch outside
has not been sober in three years.

37:28.550 --> 37:32.110
Also, it's an easy mistake to make.
They all blondes here.

37:32.890 --> 37:35.410
You see? Golden girls.

37:36.390 --> 37:38.620
That's what we call the place.

37:46.070 --> 37:49.060
Have you seen her anywhere around here?

37:51.870 --> 37:55.040
Wow. She is... How you say...

37:56.150 --> 37:57.270
Hot.

37:58.510 --> 37:59.570
Hot.

38:01.020 --> 38:02.350
She's my daughter.

38:02.990 --> 38:05.680
Why you let her come to a place like this?

38:05.760 --> 38:09.250
I tell you, American economy, very bad.

38:11.160 --> 38:13.720
Sending kids to make extra money.

38:14.530 --> 38:18.060
If your daughter come here,
you're not very good father.

38:22.840 --> 38:24.240
What'd you say to me?

38:27.940 --> 38:29.970
Come on, partner, time to go.

40:45.650 --> 40:47.050
Come on, I got you.

41:12.610 --> 41:14.240
How'd you find me?

41:15.950 --> 41:18.540
Finding people, it's what I do.

41:19.420 --> 41:21.010
Plus, it wasn't hard.

41:21.080 --> 41:24.990
Not many Americans running around clubs,
pissing people off.

41:25.050 --> 41:26.520
All right, so now you want to help?

41:31.060 --> 41:32.550
Are you sober?

41:34.760 --> 41:36.990
Until I find your daughter.
Then, we'll see.

41:39.370 --> 41:41.430
Why'd you change your mind?

41:42.400 --> 41:44.340
It's the right thing to do.

41:49.410 --> 41:51.110
One more thing, I work alone.

41:51.280 --> 41:53.180
You're a good fighter...

41:53.450 --> 41:54.920
But you make lots of noise.

41:55.050 --> 41:56.880
I can see you coming miles away.

41:57.650 --> 41:59.480
What, and they can't see you?

42:00.620 --> 42:02.280
They never do.

42:08.760 --> 42:09.960
We have a lead.

42:10.770 --> 42:13.830
Your daughter was most likely
taken out of the hotel in the ambulance

42:13.970 --> 42:17.770
that you saw when you
first ran down looking for her.

42:17.840 --> 42:19.470
They said it was an older lady.

42:19.580 --> 42:21.270
They were either mistaken,

42:21.580 --> 42:25.240
or the kidnappers dyed your daughter's hair

42:25.310 --> 42:27.750
when they drugged her unconscious.

42:28.480 --> 42:29.880
We now know that

42:29.950 --> 42:33.750
the guest listed as calling the ambulance
never actually stayed at the hotel.

42:34.290 --> 42:36.260
And you're just figuring this out now?

42:37.790 --> 42:39.780
It's been two days!

42:40.130 --> 42:42.860
Mrs. Fayden, I share your frustration.

42:43.100 --> 42:44.360
Do you?

42:45.900 --> 42:49.000
Becky could be halfway
across the world by now.

42:50.040 --> 42:52.030
And no one's asked for a ransom.

42:52.210 --> 42:57.040
So the chances of this being a trafficking
case are 80 to 90% more likely!

42:57.210 --> 43:00.880
Mrs. Fayden, the statistics on
the internet, they are not...

43:00.950 --> 43:06.180
The recovery rate for kidnapped children
after 24 hours drops to 46%!

43:07.220 --> 43:09.090
That's less than half!

43:10.390 --> 43:13.260
Constantin, give us a moment.

43:23.540 --> 43:25.300
Mr. and Mrs. Fayden,

43:25.910 --> 43:28.840
let me, as you say, cut to the chase.

43:29.040 --> 43:31.980
I have learned you have hired
a private consultant.

43:32.850 --> 43:34.610
Mr. Samson Gaul.

43:36.690 --> 43:39.050
At this point, we can use
all the help we can get.

43:40.320 --> 43:44.090
- I would not place your trust in this man.
- Why?

43:44.530 --> 43:47.430
Because he might actually get some results?

43:48.200 --> 43:49.630
Make you look bad?

43:49.830 --> 43:51.700
He is not a detective.

43:52.530 --> 43:55.830
He is an ex-mercenary. A hired killer.

43:56.410 --> 43:59.400
Do you really want such a man
working for you?

43:59.880 --> 44:03.470
I'll hire the goddamn devil himself
if it gets my daughter back.

44:07.020 --> 44:10.420
I hope you do not come
to regret your decision.

44:10.750 --> 44:14.920
His last recovery effort resulted
in the deaths of four girls.

44:15.760 --> 44:18.090
Two the same age as Becky.

44:18.630 --> 44:19.990
Two younger.

44:21.930 --> 44:25.990
Although we may not be moving
as quickly as you imagine we should,

44:26.440 --> 44:28.060
I want you to know,

44:28.140 --> 44:32.700
it is my number one priority
to get your daughter back to you safely.

44:36.510 --> 44:38.480
I just thought you should
have all the facts.

44:41.020 --> 44:43.710
Well, we'll take that under advisement.

44:44.820 --> 44:46.290
I understand.

44:47.390 --> 44:51.020
I will send someone to take you home.
I will call you later.

45:26.300 --> 45:28.860
- Good evening.
- It's a little late for delivery.

45:29.030 --> 45:31.860
I know, but the overtime is worth it.

45:32.570 --> 45:33.590
Please.

45:37.010 --> 45:38.340
Sign here.

46:19.450 --> 46:21.420
Guys. Keep your eyes open.

46:21.520 --> 46:24.180
Something's up with the monitors.

46:34.100 --> 46:35.090
Stop!

46:36.870 --> 46:38.130
Stop! Stop!

47:04.490 --> 47:05.960
Who's guarding the back?

47:13.670 --> 47:14.690
Up.

47:22.640 --> 47:24.310
What the fuck?

47:24.410 --> 47:26.510
- Boss, come on, let's get you to the vault.
- Who are they?

47:26.580 --> 47:29.180
I don't know, but we can't
take any chances. Come on!

48:10.930 --> 48:14.380
It's the fucking Russians! Gotta be.
Get more guys over here.

48:14.460 --> 48:15.830
Done.

48:42.420 --> 48:44.950
You may not feel it yet, but you will soon.

48:49.500 --> 48:54.330
It's a reminder of the most important
person in your life as of right now.

48:55.500 --> 48:57.340
You know who I am?

48:57.840 --> 49:01.330
That's why I'm here.
I want the man in charge.

49:07.180 --> 49:08.620
Where is she?

49:09.320 --> 49:10.840
American girl.

49:11.620 --> 49:14.590
- Not my thing.
- Then who?

49:15.260 --> 49:16.720
I don't know.

49:17.530 --> 49:21.090
Never touch Americans. Bad for business.

49:21.300 --> 49:25.200
Fucking cops raiding my clubs for days now.

49:25.770 --> 49:26.830
Competition.

49:27.040 --> 49:29.940
- Who wants to hurt you?
- Russians.

49:30.270 --> 49:31.760
Always trying to move in.

49:31.940 --> 49:35.770
The only reason you're alive
is because you have a job to do.

49:36.140 --> 49:38.700
- I told you...
- Shut up.

49:39.950 --> 49:41.580
You run the city.

49:42.250 --> 49:45.050
You find this girl as quickly as possible.

49:45.150 --> 49:48.550
And you bring her back to her parents
by this time tomorrow.

49:51.290 --> 49:56.130
If not, I'll come back here
and I'll carve out your eyes one by one.

49:57.070 --> 49:58.460
Am I clear?

50:00.170 --> 50:01.260
Yeah.

50:30.000 --> 50:32.630
Your passport is proof of who you are.

50:34.840 --> 50:35.960
You're no one now.

50:39.470 --> 50:42.640
I pay good money for you,
so now you work for me.

50:44.250 --> 50:45.470
Take it off.

50:49.050 --> 50:50.280
Everything.

51:01.030 --> 51:02.430
Is there a problem?

51:03.730 --> 51:05.500
Please. I can't.

51:16.240 --> 51:18.300
The next time you don't
do what you're told,

51:19.920 --> 51:21.180
I take this knife...

51:40.240 --> 51:41.930
You know the drill.

51:42.000 --> 51:44.490
Test them out and put them to work.

51:50.850 --> 51:51.870
Da?

51:51.950 --> 51:56.150
Your retard cousin is drawing too much heat.
Shut him down.

51:56.220 --> 51:58.380
The Al Khabiri thing
could be worth millions.

51:58.690 --> 52:02.590
I've made up my mind.
It's not worth the risk.

52:03.530 --> 52:06.790
Shut it down or I'll find
someone else who will.

52:27.120 --> 52:28.280
Hello?

52:28.680 --> 52:31.620
It's me. I need a GPS
trace on a cell phone.

52:32.620 --> 52:34.850
That's not easy. I'll have to go into work.

52:34.920 --> 52:37.920
Okay, get moving
and I'll text you the number.

52:38.060 --> 52:43.160
I'll also need any information
on someone or something called Al Khabiri.

52:44.630 --> 52:46.790
Fine. Anything else, Dad?

52:46.900 --> 52:49.670
You want me back? This is me back.

53:40.460 --> 53:41.890
What's going on?

53:44.030 --> 53:45.820
Come on, what's going on?

53:48.130 --> 53:51.190
Change of plans, we're shutting down.

53:51.530 --> 53:52.630
What?

53:53.370 --> 53:56.530
- Bogdanov wants out.
- No! The money's too big.

53:56.740 --> 53:59.400
That old fuck's just too rich and scared
to follow through.

54:01.410 --> 54:03.640
- I see who's got the balls around here.
- Fuck off!

54:03.710 --> 54:06.200
- You shut the fuck up.
- Who needs Bogdanov?

54:06.510 --> 54:10.310
We've got the merchandise.
A virgin. American blonde.

54:10.490 --> 54:12.510
We have exactly what they wanted.

54:15.420 --> 54:17.320
You see this? It's our ticket.

54:17.760 --> 54:21.290
We call the guy. We make our own deal.

54:21.360 --> 54:22.730
Shut up.

54:22.800 --> 54:24.770
Do you want to be a lackey
for the rest of your life,

54:24.830 --> 54:27.060
or are you ready to make some real money?

54:35.940 --> 54:37.070
Tell you one thing, cousin,

54:38.880 --> 54:40.610
you sure got yourself a live one.

54:50.460 --> 54:52.090
Stop, stop, stop!

54:55.600 --> 54:58.620
I told you, smart women are trouble.

54:59.730 --> 55:00.720
Please.

55:07.580 --> 55:09.870
Now what do I tell your mother?

55:56.190 --> 55:57.250
Hold.

56:08.000 --> 56:09.590
Let him through.

56:14.010 --> 56:17.440
- The girl?
- Well, see for yourself.

56:23.020 --> 56:26.420
One of Bogdanov's recruiters
and his sometime girlfriend.

56:32.560 --> 56:33.790
In here.

56:48.880 --> 56:50.710
Her face is gone. You sure it's her?

56:50.810 --> 56:53.580
We're checking the DNA samples
from the parents.

57:01.790 --> 57:04.090
It's Bogdanov. He shut it down.

57:04.860 --> 57:07.050
I heard him giving the order.

57:08.600 --> 57:11.000
And you did not think to call us?

57:11.470 --> 57:14.400
Of course not. Always the cowboy.

57:18.040 --> 57:20.560
Stick to what you know, butcher.

57:41.930 --> 57:44.630
Did the coordinates work? Was she here?

57:45.100 --> 57:46.230
Yeah.

58:07.720 --> 58:10.420
I just don't understand.

58:12.230 --> 58:13.220
Why would they...

58:16.060 --> 58:18.970
I mean, if it is her...

58:21.170 --> 58:23.160
Why would they want to...

58:23.740 --> 58:25.430
it seems that whoever took her

58:25.570 --> 58:26.970
felt under pressure.

58:27.040 --> 58:29.870
Afraid that they're going to be found out.

58:31.680 --> 58:34.340
Someone pushed them too hard, I guess.

58:47.600 --> 58:49.150
I'm sorry.

58:49.430 --> 58:52.990
The DNA match is positive. It's her.

59:51.260 --> 59:53.690
It's not your fault, Dad.
It's not your fault.

59:55.400 --> 59:57.060
Come on, let's go.

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:37.230
- You can go. I'll be fine.
- I think it's better if I stay.

01:00:38.270 --> 01:00:39.500
You put me up to this.

01:00:40.410 --> 01:00:42.100
You knew I was no good!

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:44.580
A girl is dead now!

01:00:45.450 --> 01:00:46.710
It's your fault, too!

01:00:46.850 --> 01:00:48.710
It's not my fault.
It's not your fault either, Dad.

01:00:48.780 --> 01:00:50.510
Get away from here!

01:00:57.530 --> 01:00:59.120
Get the fuck outta here!

01:03:22.070 --> 01:03:25.330
A butcher with feelings. Who knew?

01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:38.040
Do it.

01:03:39.340 --> 01:03:42.370
- You will be doing me a favor.
- We're not here for favors.

01:03:44.380 --> 01:03:46.110
Here to punish you.

01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:50.520
Come to my home.

01:03:52.030 --> 01:03:53.260
You kill my men.

01:03:58.300 --> 01:04:01.330
You threaten me. Mutilate me.

01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:11.780
The DNA match is...

01:04:31.210 --> 01:04:32.900
You really do want to die.

01:05:08.180 --> 01:05:09.510
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:05:12.050 --> 01:05:13.950
Whatcha doing here anyway?

01:05:14.890 --> 01:05:18.090
- I was worried about you.
- The girl.

01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:47.250
What is it? What's going on?

01:05:50.460 --> 01:05:52.760
- I need you to drive.
- To drive?

01:05:52.830 --> 01:05:54.600
- Let's go.
- Okay.

01:06:35.950 --> 01:06:38.680
- All right, please stay away from us.
- It's about your daughter.

01:06:39.420 --> 01:06:41.950
You're drunk. Get the fuck out of here!

01:06:42.290 --> 01:06:45.350
Hey, give him a chance, all right?
Listen to him. Please.

01:06:45.490 --> 01:06:49.120
Your daughter, she always
wear her bracelet on the right.

01:06:49.300 --> 01:06:50.290
What?

01:06:50.370 --> 01:06:52.960
Does Becky wear her bracelet
on her right hand?

01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:54.630
I think so.

01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:58.610
In all the photos,
her bracelet always on the right wrist.

01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:02.210
When they found her, it
was on the left wrist.

01:07:06.180 --> 01:07:10.520
It's a setup. It's all too neat.
Girls are nothing to them.

01:07:10.790 --> 01:07:14.160
They killed another blonde girl
and made her look like Becky.

01:07:14.290 --> 01:07:15.690
I think your daughter's not dead.

01:07:18.130 --> 01:07:20.530
What's the point?
Why would they fake her death?

01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:21.930
It's simple.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:25.130
You kidnap an American girl here,
you have too much heat.

01:07:25.410 --> 01:07:28.670
How do you stop people from looking,
but still profit from the girl?

01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:31.570
You fake her death, everyone stops looking.

01:07:33.080 --> 01:07:34.880
The DNA, it matched.

01:07:36.150 --> 01:07:40.350
A man once told me,
everything is for sale in this country.

01:07:58.510 --> 01:07:59.710
Don't fight it.

01:08:11.930 --> 01:08:13.330
Hey, Doctor.

01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:16.990
I believe you know
Mr. and Mrs. Fayden, right?

01:08:18.430 --> 01:08:20.399
Please. What's going on?

01:08:26.710 --> 01:08:27.840
You look worried.

01:08:29.479 --> 01:08:30.810
I don't understand.

01:08:31.279 --> 01:08:34.220
Are you sure our DNA
matched the dead girl's?

01:08:34.819 --> 01:08:36.520
Yes, of course.

01:08:40.229 --> 01:08:41.560
Where's my daughter?

01:08:43.399 --> 01:08:44.460
She's dead.

01:08:48.939 --> 01:08:49.960
Please.

01:08:51.069 --> 01:08:53.700
Who paid you off, you lying piece of shit?

01:08:55.640 --> 01:08:57.810
Please. I'm not...

01:09:00.649 --> 01:09:02.520
You are gonna tell me,

01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:05.779
or I will rip your balls
off right fucking now!

01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:07.319
Who paid you?

01:09:08.430 --> 01:09:10.420
Stelu. It was Stelu!

01:09:16.330 --> 01:09:17.700
Who's that?

01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:21.660
I'll explain on the way.
We have to get going.

01:09:22.170 --> 01:09:23.870
- Please.
- Shut up.

01:09:26.450 --> 01:09:28.310
Hey, kid. It's me.

01:09:28.550 --> 01:09:31.520
I need to know what Stelu would want
with a kidnapped American girl.

01:09:32.689 --> 01:09:34.520
Yeah, that's what I said. Stelu.

01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:39.050
Yeah, and his connection
to whatever that Al Khabiri thing is.

01:09:40.130 --> 01:09:41.490
Be careful.

01:09:42.229 --> 01:09:43.460
Please.

01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:47.430
Even Stelu cannot protect you from me.

01:09:50.710 --> 01:09:52.069
Time to go.

01:10:03.990 --> 01:10:05.080
Pull!

01:10:07.530 --> 01:10:08.620
Pull!

01:10:22.910 --> 01:10:24.400
Hello, Doctor.

01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:27.770
What?

01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:31.050
I'm sorry, you'll have to speak up.

01:10:31.890 --> 01:10:33.150
Your teeth?

01:10:36.230 --> 01:10:39.890
I see. That is unfortunate.

01:10:40.070 --> 01:10:44.130
No, no, there's nothing to worry about.
I appreciate your honesty.

01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:46.230
I'll take care of it.

01:10:48.780 --> 01:10:50.870
Your plan is falling apart.

01:10:52.310 --> 01:10:54.870
What do you know about a butcher?

01:10:55.950 --> 01:10:57.440
Bogdanov said he'll take care of him.

01:10:57.750 --> 01:10:58.950
He didn't.

01:10:59.020 --> 01:11:01.820
This butcher is now with the parents.

01:11:02.060 --> 01:11:04.860
Together, they leaned on the good doctor,

01:11:04.930 --> 01:11:08.160
who was indiscreet enough to mention me.

01:11:09.100 --> 01:11:10.360
Not good.

01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:12.790
Maybe the girl is not worth it.

01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:16.170
I could incentivize the
sheik in other ways.

01:11:17.810 --> 01:11:19.300
Let me fix it.

01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:22.240
You may need to find them first.

01:11:22.350 --> 01:11:25.540
If this butcher is local
and he has heard my name,

01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:29.120
I'm sure by now he understands
the predicament they are in,

01:11:29.250 --> 01:11:30.950
even if the parents do not.

01:11:31.190 --> 01:11:32.520
I'll find them.

01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:34.890
I'd appreciate that.

01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:38.690
Because keeping my name out of this

01:11:38.930 --> 01:11:41.630
is more important to me than the girl,

01:11:41.770 --> 01:11:44.600
the Al Khabiri deal, everything.

01:11:46.440 --> 01:11:47.670
Are we clear on this?

01:11:50.610 --> 01:11:51.980
Absolutely.

01:11:56.120 --> 01:11:57.140
Pull.

01:12:02.690 --> 01:12:06.390
Stelu's official title
is the Deputy Minister of Defense.

01:12:06.530 --> 01:12:09.090
But his real job is number two man
at State Security.

01:12:09.170 --> 01:12:10.230
The secret police.

01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:12.430
Why would they want to kidnap Becky?

01:12:12.710 --> 01:12:14.570
That's what I need to figure out.

01:12:25.590 --> 01:12:28.890
Can't we go over this Stelu guy's head?

01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:31.850
The guy who invited me here
said he knows the prime minister.

01:12:33.100 --> 01:12:35.830
No phone calls, no contact with anyone.

01:12:35.930 --> 01:12:38.370
But what would they want with us?

01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:40.530
Either by bribery or torture,

01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:43.270
the doctor told Stelu
his name has been revealed.

01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:46.940
He will protect himself at any cost.

01:12:47.180 --> 01:12:49.910
- Whose place is this?
- It's a safe house.

01:12:50.580 --> 01:12:54.420
My son arrange it until he get clearance
to move you to the embassy.

01:12:54.490 --> 01:12:57.480
Look, my daughter is out there.
I'm not gonna be hiding in this house.

01:12:58.130 --> 01:13:00.180
I can't protect you
and look for her at the same time.

01:13:10.410 --> 01:13:12.870
- Did you ever use one of these?
- No.

01:13:14.110 --> 01:13:15.130
I have.

01:13:17.550 --> 01:13:19.170
My dad was army.

01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:24.420
This is insane. We can't do this alone.

01:13:24.790 --> 01:13:27.780
I'm gonna reach out to the police
to see who we can trust.

01:13:28.390 --> 01:13:32.960
If anyone besides me or my son
show up here, shoot him dead.

01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:36.120
Stelu's people can trace anything here.

01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:39.770
So no phone calls,
no contact with the outside. Okay?

01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:08.530
Okay.

01:14:26.030 --> 01:14:28.960
- Hey, where'd you get those?
- What?

01:14:30.130 --> 01:14:32.000
The sunglasses. They're mine.

01:14:33.030 --> 01:14:34.130
Mine now.

01:14:34.900 --> 01:14:36.000
Wait.

01:14:38.310 --> 01:14:40.670
Want them back? What do I get?

01:14:40.810 --> 01:14:41.940
No, not the glasses.

01:14:43.010 --> 01:14:44.980
Did they keep my other stuff?

01:14:45.050 --> 01:14:47.710
You know, like my wallet, my phone.

01:14:50.150 --> 01:14:53.780
Some advice. Don't do anything stupid.

01:14:54.090 --> 01:14:56.030
They want you pure for some big shot.

01:14:56.760 --> 01:14:59.530
But remember,
there's many ways to use a girl

01:14:59.830 --> 01:15:01.960
and still keep her a virgin.

01:15:22.190 --> 01:15:24.720
- Keep walking.
- You have lost your mind.

01:15:24.930 --> 01:15:26.690
I hear you have kidnapped the Faydens.

01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:30.490
I'm hiding them. Their daughter's alive.
The doctor faked the DNA.

01:15:30.740 --> 01:15:31.860
Stelu's behind it.

01:15:31.940 --> 01:15:34.340
Stelu? State Security?
That's ridiculous. Why?

01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:36.370
I don't know. I need you to find out.

01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:38.170
If you are right,
why the fuck have you involved me?

01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:39.300
I have a family too!

01:15:39.410 --> 01:15:41.780
You're the only honest cop I know, okay?

01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:45.780
Fuck.

01:15:47.820 --> 01:15:50.880
- Those your guys?
- No. Stelu's.

01:15:51.390 --> 01:15:54.990
Okay, listen. I'll be in touch with you
through my son, okay?

01:15:59.930 --> 01:16:01.300
State Security.

01:16:06.340 --> 01:16:09.240
Close off the perimeter.
He's on the move. Where is he?

01:16:10.050 --> 01:16:11.040
Who?

01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:14.910
You don't want to play this game with me.

01:16:14.990 --> 01:16:19.120
No games, comrade.
I was simply taking a suspect into custody.

01:16:19.190 --> 01:16:20.450
You interfered, he escaped.

01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:24.790
And that is what I shall put in my report.

01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:01.770
Sorry. Having a bad day.

01:17:03.170 --> 01:17:04.370
Thanks.

01:17:07.210 --> 01:17:08.440
Shit. They're early.

01:17:09.250 --> 01:17:10.340
Idiots.

01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:43.960
- Becky?
- Daddy?

01:21:44.630 --> 01:21:46.600
Oh, baby, where are you?

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:51.030
I don't know. Some kind of old prison.
Somewhere in the country. Listen.

01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:53.300
- Becky, are you okay?
- Are you okay?

01:21:53.410 --> 01:21:57.350
No. Yes. No time for that.
I may only have seconds.

01:21:57.850 --> 01:22:00.040
I don't know where I am,
but you can figure it out.

01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:01.110
Get my computer.

01:22:01.390 --> 01:22:04.020
- What?
- Daddy, please do as I say.

01:22:04.090 --> 01:22:05.920
I'm calling from my own cell phone,

01:22:05.990 --> 01:22:09.480
so you can use the "find my phone"
program on my laptop.

01:22:10.900 --> 01:22:14.490
- Get her computer.
- It's on the desktop.

01:22:14.630 --> 01:22:17.360
Even if I have to hang up,
you should still be able to track the phone

01:22:17.470 --> 01:22:20.000
- as long as it's still powered up.
- Good.

01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:24.900
That is brilliant, princess.
You're a genius.

01:22:27.220 --> 01:22:30.810
- Are you hurt?
- No, not really. I'm just scared.

01:22:31.250 --> 01:22:32.920
Please find me, Daddy.

01:22:33.020 --> 01:22:35.720
- We will, sweetheart, we will.
- Mom.

01:22:36.030 --> 01:22:38.620
You're gonna be fine, honey, okay?
You're gonna be fine. Hurry.

01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:06.360
You know, you're right, princess.
Old people do suck at technology.

01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:10.800
Please, please...

01:23:12.470 --> 01:23:14.300
- Hurry.
- It's searching.

01:23:17.170 --> 01:23:18.200
Someone's coming.

01:23:22.850 --> 01:23:24.310
I got it. I got it.

01:23:24.950 --> 01:23:26.280
Thank God.

01:23:26.350 --> 01:23:28.880
Okay, please hurry. I'll just...

01:23:32.130 --> 01:23:34.920
- Becky? Becky!
- Becky? Becky?

01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:41.130
No, no, don't!

01:23:41.270 --> 01:23:44.830
If you call, the phone will ring,
and they'll find her.

01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:21.070
Let me go! Let me go!

01:24:22.520 --> 01:24:25.350
Get off of me! Let me go!

01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:27.840
Help!

01:24:29.020 --> 01:24:30.180
Please!

01:24:33.430 --> 01:24:36.230
Thank you. Stelu's guy
traced the kid's call.

01:24:36.730 --> 01:24:39.330
We should have the parents' address
in a few minutes.

01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:42.240
Good. Send some guys over.

01:24:42.710 --> 01:24:44.670
I'll bet you a night with Marina here

01:24:45.610 --> 01:24:47.510
they're coming straight to us.

01:24:48.010 --> 01:24:49.000
There it is.

01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:51.850
Chyornaya 13. it's an old Soviet prison.

01:24:52.180 --> 01:24:55.480
It's in the middle of nowhere.
It's almost at the Ukrainian border.

01:24:55.690 --> 01:24:58.520
It's gonna take us all night to drive there.
Should we call the police?

01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:01.620
Call Gaul.

01:25:03.930 --> 01:25:05.260
Let's call him from the road.

01:25:13.780 --> 01:25:16.040
You know that name you had me look up?

01:25:16.150 --> 01:25:18.140
- Al Khabiri?
- Yeah.

01:25:18.550 --> 01:25:21.710
Turns out it's Sheik Muhammad Al Khabiri.

01:25:22.420 --> 01:25:25.720
He's the main financier
to the northern Sudanese Army.

01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:30.120
Since the new embargo, he's been
shopping for a new weapons supplier.

01:25:30.590 --> 01:25:34.960
Now, if you're not touchy about getting paid
in blood diamonds or other conflict minerals,

01:25:35.070 --> 01:25:38.400
then the contract is worth a billion.
Maybe more.

01:25:39.270 --> 01:25:41.370
So I guess Stelu wants the deal.

01:25:41.470 --> 01:25:42.570
Right.

01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:45.200
There's still lots of old Soviet arsenal
to be sold off.

01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:47.370
Plus, it's a great way
to create jobs right here at home.

01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:49.750
Where does the Fayden kid come in?

01:25:49.880 --> 01:25:52.280
- Al Khabiri's a collector.
- Girls?

01:25:52.820 --> 01:25:54.050
Virgins.

01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:56.790
Word has it he's partial to blondes.

01:25:57.830 --> 01:25:58.950
American blondes.

01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:00.420
The younger, the better.

01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:02.520
- So Stelu is...
- He's trying to sweeten the deal.

01:26:02.870 --> 01:26:06.030
Bring them the one thing
no one else can deliver.

01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:09.440
So they fake the girl's death,
hoping we stop looking.

01:26:09.510 --> 01:26:10.530
Right.

01:26:11.270 --> 01:26:13.040
So, what's the plan now?

01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:16.440
You get to my friend,
the inspector and see if...

01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:17.680
Hold on.

01:26:19.220 --> 01:26:20.240
Hello?

01:26:20.450 --> 01:26:21.920
I'm trying to reach Gaul.

01:26:22.350 --> 01:26:23.450
Hold on.

01:26:23.560 --> 01:26:24.780
Fayden.

01:26:25.690 --> 01:26:27.960
Fayden. Why you using the phone?

01:26:28.460 --> 01:26:29.550
Becky called.

01:26:29.660 --> 01:26:32.500
- She's at Chyornaya Prison.
- What?

01:26:32.630 --> 01:26:34.930
Becky called. She's at Chyornaya Prison.

01:26:36.340 --> 01:26:39.030
Can you hear me? Becky called.

01:26:39.910 --> 01:26:41.240
Is she okay?

01:26:41.410 --> 01:26:43.840
We're on our way there right now.

01:26:44.510 --> 01:26:46.570
No, stop! Hello?

01:26:48.820 --> 01:26:50.680
Can you hear me?

01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:54.590
I think we're on our own.

01:26:56.160 --> 01:26:58.150
Yeah, Chyornaya Number 13.

01:26:58.230 --> 01:27:01.500
It's an old Soviet prison,
abandoned for quite some time now.

01:27:01.970 --> 01:27:04.370
It's about 90 clicks north of here
on the Volga Highway.

01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:06.170
Nothing and no one around.

01:27:06.270 --> 01:27:07.800
It's a perfect place for traffickers.

01:27:07.870 --> 01:27:10.000
Yeah, and ambush, too. Come on, let's go.

01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:35.900
Now what?

01:27:36.610 --> 01:27:37.800
We have to...

01:27:40.580 --> 01:27:42.070
I have an idea. Back up.

01:28:04.340 --> 01:28:05.970
Private property.

01:28:08.410 --> 01:28:09.540
Private property.

01:28:10.680 --> 01:28:14.640
I'm sorry, I'm really lost.
Is there a phone?

01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:16.180
Private property.

01:28:16.650 --> 01:28:18.680
Well, I'm willing to pay.

01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:23.850
Here.

01:28:25.230 --> 01:28:26.490
Sorry.

01:28:36.180 --> 01:28:39.480
- American girl, blonde. Where is she?
- No.

01:28:40.950 --> 01:28:43.750
You tell me or I will
snap your fucking neck.

01:28:44.820 --> 01:28:46.650
4. Building 4.

01:28:53.760 --> 01:28:54.960
Did you...

01:28:55.460 --> 01:28:57.190
They took Becky.

01:28:58.900 --> 01:29:00.370
Take his gun.

01:29:12.890 --> 01:29:13.980
Come on.

01:29:25.070 --> 01:29:27.800
There's a guard down at the front gate.

01:29:52.260 --> 01:29:53.360
Move.

01:29:59.410 --> 01:30:00.630
Come on.

01:30:15.790 --> 01:30:17.160
Don't move!

01:30:17.660 --> 01:30:19.560
Guns on the ground! Now!

01:30:20.230 --> 01:30:23.430
Okay. Okay, just don't shoot.

01:30:26.070 --> 01:30:27.770
Turn around! Slowly.

01:30:31.210 --> 01:30:32.970
We have them, we have them.

01:30:33.550 --> 01:30:34.570
Finish it.

01:31:06.180 --> 01:31:08.620
- He took Becky that way.
- Let's go.

01:31:14.060 --> 01:31:16.760
- Damn it.
- Sorry, boss, we didn't expect the butcher.

01:31:17.330 --> 01:31:19.960
Get everyone over there. Finish it.

01:31:26.210 --> 01:31:27.730
Get the kid ready to move.

01:31:44.230 --> 01:31:45.390
Becky!

01:31:48.930 --> 01:31:50.590
Please, please unlock me.

01:31:51.770 --> 01:31:53.830
Becky, the American girl.
Have you seen her?

01:31:54.910 --> 01:31:57.670
They took her to another building, I think.

01:31:57.880 --> 01:32:01.440
- Where?
- Through tunnels. I can show you.

01:32:01.680 --> 01:32:03.510
Please let me go.

01:32:04.080 --> 01:32:06.140
- Which way?
- That way.

01:32:09.220 --> 01:32:12.620
And now they have Tanya.
Are your guys sleepwalking over there?

01:32:13.130 --> 01:32:14.750
They are coming our way
through the tunnels.

01:32:14.830 --> 01:32:17.130
Cut them off under Building 3.

01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:20.130
And get Tanya back in one piece.
She cost me a fortune.

01:32:48.770 --> 01:32:50.070
Look out! Gas!

01:32:50.270 --> 01:32:51.260
Get back! Get back!

01:33:19.670 --> 01:33:22.730
Pasha, cut them off on the north side of 3.

01:33:23.910 --> 01:33:27.210
Gavril, come around from south
in case they head for the gate.

01:33:30.650 --> 01:33:32.080
Look. There.

01:33:33.350 --> 01:33:34.580
They're on the north side.

01:33:35.390 --> 01:33:37.880
They're on the north side of 3.

01:34:22.740 --> 01:34:24.270
There are cameras everywhere.

01:34:43.470 --> 01:34:44.800
Pull the pin.

01:34:45.100 --> 01:34:47.940
On my cue, throw hard.

01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:08.950
Now!

01:35:33.460 --> 01:35:37.830
Fuck. It's the butcher.
He brought a fucking arsenal.

01:35:40.530 --> 01:35:41.520
What?

01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:43.730
I hear you're having problems.

01:35:45.170 --> 01:35:46.370
I'm handling it.

01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:48.140
See that you do.

01:35:48.380 --> 01:35:49.370
In an hour,

01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:53.350
I'll have no choice but to move in
and shut you down officially.

01:35:53.480 --> 01:35:56.940
We have an agreement.
The girl, the Al Khabiri deal...

01:35:57.050 --> 01:35:59.650
ls getting less tempting as we speak.

01:35:59.720 --> 01:36:03.280
I'm getting some very direct pressure
from the American Embassy.

01:36:03.390 --> 01:36:06.660
I've got a police commissioner
nosing around in my business.

01:36:06.730 --> 01:36:10.790
All kinds of scrutiny
I spend my life trying to avoid.

01:36:10.870 --> 01:36:11.930
I can definitely...

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:16.270
So you have one hour
to make this thing go away.

01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:18.370
Or I will.

01:36:25.850 --> 01:36:27.220
Fuck!

01:36:29.420 --> 01:36:31.980
The girl's ready. Are we moving her?

01:36:37.770 --> 01:36:39.930
- Kiril.
- Boss.

01:36:42.170 --> 01:36:45.540
Keep blocking the exits.
Pull everyone else back.

01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:49.640
Get your brother
and take high positions there and there.

01:36:53.690 --> 01:36:55.810
I'm not losing any more men.

01:36:59.230 --> 01:37:00.990
Pull back, pull back!

01:37:04.100 --> 01:37:06.360
They're pulling back.
Something is going on.

01:37:15.140 --> 01:37:18.140
- Hello.
- I'm a businessman first.

01:37:18.580 --> 01:37:22.480
This whole mess is getting a bit expensive.

01:37:23.490 --> 01:37:24.920
I want to trade.

01:37:25.260 --> 01:37:27.550
Your daughter for Tanya.

01:37:31.630 --> 01:37:32.930
Let me talk to Becky.

01:37:33.800 --> 01:37:35.860
You don't make the rules, Mr. Fayden.

01:37:36.270 --> 01:37:37.330
I do.

01:37:37.900 --> 01:37:41.630
I'm pulling my men back, and in five
minutes you will walk Tanya out,

01:37:41.710 --> 01:37:45.270
and I will do the same with your daughter.
We will trade.

01:37:52.450 --> 01:37:54.010
They want to trade.

01:37:57.430 --> 01:38:00.020
No. I can't go back.

01:38:00.860 --> 01:38:01.850
God.

01:38:02.500 --> 01:38:05.590
We can't trust him. It's a setup.

01:38:06.500 --> 01:38:08.560
Bring her. Quickly.

01:38:20.620 --> 01:38:22.020
In position.

01:38:24.860 --> 01:38:25.880
Speaker.

01:38:30.030 --> 01:38:31.020
Hello?

01:38:31.870 --> 01:38:32.890
No!

01:38:33.330 --> 01:38:35.860
That was your daughter's pinky finger,
Mr. Fayden.

01:38:36.340 --> 01:38:39.830
If you don't bring Tanya out in four
minutes, I'll start carving her tits.

01:38:39.980 --> 01:38:41.240
No!

01:38:41.680 --> 01:38:43.840
Oh, and one more thing.

01:38:44.710 --> 01:38:48.340
Six meters from where you're hiding,
there is a security camera.

01:38:49.720 --> 01:38:53.880
Move the butcher there so I can see him,
or else we don't have a deal.

01:38:56.360 --> 01:39:00.420
- What can we do?
- Well, we can't just...

01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:05.260
We can't just what?

01:39:06.870 --> 01:39:11.000
We can't just what?
They're torturing my baby!

01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:13.900
Please.

01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:16.210
Please.

01:39:18.750 --> 01:39:21.920
I'm sorry. Becky's only 14.

01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:26.690
My sister.

01:39:27.860 --> 01:39:30.860
My little sister Katya.

01:39:33.540 --> 01:39:35.400
She was only 12.

01:39:36.140 --> 01:39:37.770
She's the one

01:39:40.210 --> 01:39:41.340
they cut up

01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:44.810
to make it look like your daughter died.

01:39:46.050 --> 01:39:48.680
She did nothing wrong.

01:39:49.220 --> 01:39:53.210
She was just the right size. Right hair.

01:39:56.530 --> 01:39:57.520
What do we do?

01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:02.070
They're setting an ambush.

01:40:06.570 --> 01:40:07.740
Do you trust me?

01:40:20.790 --> 01:40:21.850
In position.

01:40:22.060 --> 01:40:24.150
We're both in position.

01:40:40.580 --> 01:40:42.980
- Yes?
- We're coming out.

01:40:43.780 --> 01:40:44.880
Good.

01:40:53.330 --> 01:40:56.960
One wrong move, and your parents die.
Got it?

01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:41.680
Stop.

01:42:47.130 --> 01:42:48.320
Switch.

01:42:57.870 --> 01:42:58.860
Now!

01:43:05.180 --> 01:43:06.340
Take them out.

01:43:07.420 --> 01:43:08.910
Take them out.

01:43:10.050 --> 01:43:12.020
Take them out now!

01:43:12.090 --> 01:43:13.280
Kiril.

01:43:13.860 --> 01:43:16.120
Kiril! Gavril!

01:43:16.960 --> 01:43:18.160
Gavril!

01:43:18.900 --> 01:43:20.260
They're both dead.

01:43:21.970 --> 01:43:24.230
Now at this point,
you may be asking yourself

01:43:24.800 --> 01:43:28.240
how a man can be
in two places at the same time.

01:43:29.610 --> 01:43:31.910
Now that's a very good question.

01:43:33.410 --> 01:43:34.880
I used a device called a cycler.

01:43:36.690 --> 01:43:40.750
It loops the same image
over and over again on the video feed.

01:43:42.020 --> 01:43:44.420
I've found it useful in the past.

01:43:50.800 --> 01:43:53.600
Everyone move in.
Take out the kid and the parents. Move in!

01:43:54.070 --> 01:43:55.470
Move in now!

01:44:16.100 --> 01:44:18.090
Police! Get down, get down!

01:44:24.410 --> 01:44:26.700
Police! Lay down your weapons!

01:44:26.980 --> 01:44:30.640
This is the police!
Lay down your weapons, or you will be shot!

01:46:36.290 --> 01:46:37.890
- These your guys?
- Yeah.

01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:39.620
How did you know?

01:46:40.560 --> 01:46:43.330
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

01:46:43.970 --> 01:46:45.300
Will do.

01:46:45.540 --> 01:46:47.800
Thank you. Thank you so much.

01:46:47.870 --> 01:46:50.070
Your son was very persuasive.

01:46:50.340 --> 01:46:53.110
The ambassador goes hunting
with the police commissioner.

01:46:53.240 --> 01:46:57.310
The police commissioner, whose brother
was once interrogated by Stelu himself.

01:46:58.590 --> 01:46:59.980
You did good, kid.

01:47:04.120 --> 01:47:05.150
Thank you.

01:47:06.230 --> 01:47:08.420
I'm just glad you finally
called the police.

01:47:26.450 --> 01:47:28.750
Thank you doesn't seem enough.

01:47:29.350 --> 01:47:31.180
Maybe next time you'll buy a steak or two.

01:47:31.620 --> 01:47:33.490
Maybe when I come back for the fight.

01:47:34.460 --> 01:47:35.480
Okay.

01:47:37.330 --> 01:47:38.920
Let's get going.

01:47:47.570 --> 01:47:48.940
Yeah, well.

01:47:51.650 --> 01:47:54.270
Dad, your ghosts,

01:47:55.050 --> 01:47:56.310
they still visit?

01:47:56.380 --> 01:47:57.850
Not for a while.

01:47:57.920 --> 01:48:00.520
At least, not where I'm working.

01:49:13.240 --> 01:49:15.670
Forgive me, Father, I have sinned.

01:49:16.310 --> 01:49:20.640
It's been quite a while
since my last confession.

01:49:22.420 --> 01:49:25.180
I wonder,

01:49:26.920 --> 01:49:30.990
does God really forgive
even our worst crimes?

01:49:32.160 --> 01:49:33.460
God might.

01:49:35.100 --> 01:49:36.330
I won't.
