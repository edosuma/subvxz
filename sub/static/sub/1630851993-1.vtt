have you got, sis?

13:17.040 --> 13:19.160

Isn't that enough?

22:30.960 --> 22:32.760
I knew she didn't have the guts.

22:32.760 --> 22:36.480
If it's alright with you guys,
I still want to run the course.

22:36.480 --> 22:38.000
I reckon I can beat Guy's record.

22:38.000 --> 22:40.280
You think you've got
the big googalas, huh?

22:40.280 --> 22:42.720
I think I've got normal testicles
but a positive attitude.

22:42.720 --> 22:43.960
That's not enough.

22:43.960 --> 22:45.080
Hey! Look!

22:46.880 --> 22:48.560
What the fuck is she wearing?

22:50.040 --> 22:55.480
(PANTS)

22:55.480 --> 22:58.000
What are you all looking at?

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
You never seen a well-dressed,
depressed Aboriginal woman

23:01.000 --> 23:02.560
who's come to prove herself

23:02.560 --> 23:04.600
to a bunch of weirdos
she doesn't even respect

23:04.600 --> 23:06.680
and run that rickety lawsuit
waiting to happen

23:06.680 --> 23:10.040
just because she has
nowhere else to go?!

23:10.040 --> 23:12.280
Yeah. Yeah.

23:12.280 --> 23:14.680
Yeah!
Yeah.

23:14.680 --> 23:16.160
OK.

23:16.160 --> 23:17.720
Right.

23:17.720 --> 23:20.280
Now, imagine this.

23:20.280 --> 23:22.240
The world's ended.

23:22.240 --> 23:28.000
You're surrounded by starving gubbas
who wanna eat your precious meats.

23:28.000 --> 23:34.080
You need to run through the decaying
remains of white civilisation.

23:35.360 --> 23:37.520
Fig, you first. You ready?

23:37.520 --> 23:38.880
So ready!

23:38.880 --> 23:41.680
Go.

Didn't...didn't think
I could make it, huh?

25:29.720 --> 25:32.120
Fig, Charlie, give them a moment.

25:32.120 --> 25:34.320
(ALL WHISPER)

25:34.320 --> 25:37.640
OK, given that you both
completed the course,

25:37.640 --> 25:40.320
we have concluded...it's a tie.

25:40.320 --> 25:42.640
And in the event of a tie,

25:42.640 --> 25:45.360
we feel that we have the final say.

25:46.360 --> 25:49.400
We want Charlie to stay.
Yeah!

25:49.400 --> 25:51.320
Wait, what?
Yeah. Wait, what?

25:51.320 --> 25:54.800
Guys, I've tried so hard to fit in.
Yeah?

25:56.160 --> 25:58.960
Please don't kick me out.
Look, I don't even need a bed.

25:58.960 --> 26:01.880
I can just sleep on, you know, the
cold concrete floor of the bunker.

26:02.880 --> 26:06.200
Lionel, you know you're my
number one favourite Aboriginal.

26:06.200 --> 26:09.040
I'm not Aboriginal. I'm Sri Lankan.

26:09.040 --> 26:12.000
Really? Does Kelly know?
Of course I know.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.840
Jayden, mate, I am just like you.

26:13.840 --> 26:16.120
I'm Irish!
We're the blacks of Europe!

26:16.120 --> 26:20.000
No, you're white and I'm black. And
what you just said is problematic.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.280
Listen, Fig,
if this was a zombie apocalypse

26:22.280 --> 26:24.760
and you were bit,
you'd want a mercy kill, yeah?

26:24.760 --> 26:27.000
Well, I'm gonna give it to you.

26:27.000 --> 26:28.840
You're annoying and we hate you.

26:28.840 --> 26:30.520
Is that true?
Yeah.

she was a prepper from me.

We all have our secrets.

We're all trying to survive
something, Charlie.

27:14.160 --> 27:15.920
Why are you being so nice to me?

27:15.920 --> 27:22.040
Well, Eden was built on the idea of
rebuilding from the ashes.

27:22.040 --> 27:24.960
It's our motto. Patent pending.

Can we talk?

28:00.560 --> 28:02.520
Yeah, sure.

28:02.520 --> 28:06.640
Look, I should never have
put you in a position

28:06.640 --> 28:08.800
where you felt like
you had to decide

28:08.800 --> 28:11.120
between Australia Day
and your identity.

28:11.120 --> 28:14.600
So I just want to say
I'm...I'm sorry.

28:14.600 --> 28:19.760
Oh! Oh, wow. Uh, thank you, Thomas.

28:19.760 --> 28:22.440
I am so excited to do the editorial.

28:22.440 --> 28:24.440
I've got all these ideas...
Oh, babe, no.

28:24.440 --> 28:27.400
You...you can't do the editorial.

28:27.400 --> 28:30.240
It's too...it's too divisive.

28:30.240 --> 28:31.760
But Sophie's gonna be a good ally

28:31.760 --> 28:33.960
and she'll just host
the whole show by herself.

28:33.960 --> 28:35.840
So it's fine. It's fine.

28:35.840 --> 28:37.320
What?

28:37.320 --> 28:40.280
Actually, it was Sophie
who suggested

28:40.280 --> 28:42.600
that I...I should apologise.

Bianca Vita Extrait de Parfum.

28:49.840 --> 28:51.240
I said I'll do it.

28:51.240 --> 28:52.880
You'll do what?

28:52.880 --> 28:56.000
I'll do the Australia Day show.
No editorial at all.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.640
You will? Really?
Yeah.

28:57.640 --> 29:00.600

possibly go wrong?
