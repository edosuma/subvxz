02:16.354 --> 02:18.584
Wait. No, no, no!
Don't, don't, don't!

02:18.657 --> 02:20.147
Don't. No! No!

02:33.405 --> 02:35.305
<i>It's a jungle out there</i>

02:35.941 --> 02:38.273
<i>Disorder and confusion
everywhere</i>

02:40.412 --> 02:42.175
<i>No one seems to care</i>

02:42.847 --> 02:43.871
<i>Well, I do</i>

02:43.949 --> 02:46.645
<i>Hey, who's in charge here?</i>

02:46.785 --> 02:48.685
<i>It's a jungle out there</i>

02:50.522 --> 02:52.854
<i>Poison in the very air
we breathe</i>

02:53.725 --> 02:56.216
<i>You know what's in the water
that you drink?</i>

02:56.294 --> 02:57.283
<i>Well, I do</i>

02:57.362 --> 02:59.990
<i>It's amazing</i>

03:00.565 --> 03:01.964
<i>People think I'm crazy</i>

03:02.033 --> 03:03.728
<i>'cause I worry
all the time</i>

03:03.802 --> 03:06.703
<i>If you paid attention,
you'd be worried, too</i>

03:07.138 --> 03:08.435
<i>You better pay attention</i>

03:08.506 --> 03:10.804
<i>Or this world
we love so much</i>

03:11.476 --> 03:14.536
<i>might just kill you</i>

03:15.213 --> 03:16.976
<i>I could be wrong now</i>

03:17.482 --> 03:19.211
<i>But I don't think so</i>

03:19.284 --> 03:21.616
<i>'Cause there's
a jungle out there</i>

03:22.087 --> 03:23.987
<i>It's a jungle out there</i>

03:29.894 --> 03:31.987
How about a watch? I
already have a watch.

03:32.063 --> 03:33.189
Well, some people
have two.

03:33.264 --> 03:35.027
Why would I
want two?

03:35.467 --> 03:37.332
Look, if you have
one wristwatch,

03:37.402 --> 03:38.562
you always know
what time it is.

03:38.637 --> 03:39.968
If you have two,
you're never sure.

03:40.038 --> 03:41.027
Mr. Monk,
come on.

03:41.106 --> 03:42.368
I have to get you something.
It's your birthday.

03:42.440 --> 03:43.464
Don't remind me.

03:43.541 --> 03:44.906
And not just any birthday,
you're 50 years old.

03:44.976 --> 03:46.307
That's a milestone.
Okay, look.

03:46.378 --> 03:48.642
You don't...
You don't understand.

03:49.314 --> 03:51.441
He's coming.
He's coming.

03:51.516 --> 03:52.505
If you buy me something,

03:52.584 --> 03:54.449
then I have to
pretend to like it.

03:54.519 --> 03:56.009
And then I have to
remember to thank you,

03:56.087 --> 03:57.076
and then I
have to return it.

03:57.155 --> 03:59.783
And it's a nightmare.
It's a nightmare.

04:01.493 --> 04:02.619
Where is everybody?

04:02.694 --> 04:04.719
Oh, they're probably
in the Captain's office.

04:04.796 --> 04:06.024
He said it was
very important.

04:06.097 --> 04:07.155
Hmm.

04:08.066 --> 04:10.034
Where are the cups? What cups?

04:10.101 --> 04:12.262
All the cups
and the paper plates.

04:12.337 --> 04:14.328
Yesterday there
was a big pile here.

04:14.406 --> 04:16.430
I don't know.
We're late, come on.

04:16.507 --> 04:17.702
Wait

04:19.476 --> 04:20.738
a minute.

04:27.852 --> 04:29.252
Uh-oh.

04:30.723 --> 04:32.452
What are you doing?

04:33.092 --> 04:34.423
I knew it.

04:39.432 --> 04:41.127
Why'd the Captain
want to see me again?

04:41.200 --> 04:44.135
I told you, it's a double
homicide in Marin County.

04:44.203 --> 04:45.966
You said
triple homicide.

04:46.038 --> 04:49.064
I don't think so. You
said "triple," all right?

04:49.241 --> 04:52.301
What happened? Did somebody
get better, Natalie?

04:55.781 --> 04:56.907
It's a party,
isn't it?

04:56.982 --> 04:59.280
It's a surprise party.

04:59.351 --> 05:01.012
No... Mr. Monk,
I would never do that.

05:01.087 --> 05:02.452
I know how you
hate parties.

05:02.521 --> 05:04.148
Nice try, Teeger.

05:04.824 --> 05:07.019
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Mr. Monk, okay.

05:07.093 --> 05:09.994
It's a surprise party.
Can't you just play along?

05:10.062 --> 05:11.256
I don't wanna
play along.

05:11.330 --> 05:12.661
Come on,
everybody's chipped in.

05:12.732 --> 05:15.064
We've been planning
it for weeks.

05:18.471 --> 05:19.699
I can't.

05:19.905 --> 05:21.395
I can't do it.

05:22.041 --> 05:23.668
I hate birthdays.

05:30.282 --> 05:31.943
What were
we thinking?

05:32.017 --> 05:34.542
He's the best detective
in the world.

05:37.123 --> 05:38.886
Uh-uh, I am not giving up, Mr. Monk.

05:38.958 --> 05:40.357
You're officially
on notice.

05:40.426 --> 05:41.552
I am throwing
you a party.

05:41.627 --> 05:42.616
As a matter of fact,
you're not.

05:42.695 --> 05:43.719
Oh, yes, I am.

05:43.796 --> 05:45.889
We're gonna have balloons
and cake and dancing.

05:45.965 --> 05:47.899
Oh, for the love
of God, why?

05:47.967 --> 05:49.901
Because, Mr. Monk,
it's your birthday.

05:49.969 --> 05:50.993
And whether you
like it or not,

05:51.070 --> 05:52.196
you have friends
who love you

05:52.271 --> 05:53.829
and want to
celebrate your life.

05:53.906 --> 05:55.032
We're happy
you were born.

05:55.107 --> 05:56.699
You're so cruel.

05:57.710 --> 05:59.974
Oh, my God! Where's
the rest of him?

06:00.045 --> 06:01.137
That's all
there is.

06:01.213 --> 06:03.374
He's all squished!

06:03.449 --> 06:04.882
His name was
Bradley Foster.

06:04.950 --> 06:06.679
He was the
maintenance man here.

06:06.752 --> 06:08.549
Apparently, he fell into the compactor.

06:08.621 --> 06:11.681
I'm gonna send a guy out to
check the parking lot for his car.

06:11.757 --> 06:13.088
Yeah, I'd look
for a compact.

06:13.159 --> 06:15.093
It's not funny.

06:15.161 --> 06:16.253
Hey, did you see what he was wearing?

06:16.328 --> 06:18.159
Those aren't briefs,
they're more like boxers.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.058
He was probably
still alive

06:22.134 --> 06:24.295
when he dropped
into the gears.

06:24.370 --> 06:28.500
The rotating blades must
have ripped his spinal column

06:28.574 --> 06:30.474
and shredded his lungs.

06:31.076 --> 06:34.204
He must have been screaming
and begging for his life

06:34.280 --> 06:36.009
the whole way down.

06:36.882 --> 06:39.817
Captain, this is Paul
Wellman, the building manager.

06:39.885 --> 06:40.909
He found the body.

06:40.986 --> 06:42.248
And when was that,
Mr. Wellman?

06:42.321 --> 06:43.345
It was at 8:30.

06:43.422 --> 06:44.912
I had noticed that
the door was open

06:44.990 --> 06:47.788
and that was kind of
strange, so I, you know,

06:47.860 --> 06:50.260
turned on the lights
and I came in

06:50.796 --> 06:52.024
and that's when
I saw the blood

06:52.097 --> 06:54.497
sort of... Sort of
trickling down.

06:54.700 --> 06:57.134
At first, I thought it was an
animal that had been trapped.

06:57.203 --> 07:00.866
I looked inside, and
that's when I saw Bradley.

07:01.307 --> 07:02.399
What do you
think happened?

07:02.474 --> 07:04.567
Well, the compactor
must have jammed.

07:04.643 --> 07:07.271
I guess he forgot to turn
off the circuit breaker.

07:07.346 --> 07:08.938
Look, I've been
here 15 years,

07:09.014 --> 07:11.244
and we have never had an
accident like this before.

07:11.317 --> 07:12.785
Tell him, Randy.

07:12.853 --> 07:14.946
It's not an accident
until we say it is.

07:15.021 --> 07:16.420
How long did
he work here?

07:16.489 --> 07:19.253
Five years, give or
take. He was a good man.

07:19.326 --> 07:20.315
Mmm-hmm.

07:20.393 --> 07:21.621
Yeah, excuse me.

07:21.695 --> 07:25.131
You said you came in and
you turned on the lights.

07:25.198 --> 07:26.187
That's right.

07:26.266 --> 07:28.200
Are you sure about
that, about the lights?

07:28.268 --> 07:30.202
Yes, sir. I'll
never forget it.

07:30.270 --> 07:33.000
I turned on the lights
and saw the blood.

07:33.440 --> 07:35.567
Why ask him
about the lights?

07:36.176 --> 07:37.803
Who turned
them off?

07:37.878 --> 07:39.345
Oh, yeah.

07:40.013 --> 07:42.038
That makes things a whole
lot more interesting.

07:42.115 --> 07:44.675
Let's seal this building.
Talk to everybody.

07:44.751 --> 07:47.845
Mr. Wellman, was anybody
else here last night?

07:47.921 --> 07:49.354
Well, there's
a camera in the lobby,

07:49.422 --> 07:50.719
and I was just
checking the tape.

07:50.790 --> 07:52.917
It looks like there
was one other guy here.

07:52.993 --> 07:55.086
Meckler, Richard Meckler.

07:55.161 --> 07:56.287
Meckler, got it.

07:56.363 --> 07:58.194
Now, he left around midnight, but...

07:58.265 --> 08:00.096
I mean, I don't think
that means anything

08:00.166 --> 08:02.031
'cause he works
late a lot.

08:02.102 --> 08:03.694
What does he do?

08:05.705 --> 08:07.036
Ladies and gentlemen,

08:07.107 --> 08:10.304
my name is Richard Meckler.
I'm a patent attorney.

08:10.443 --> 08:13.844
Now, I must hear 1,000
bad ideas every year.

08:13.914 --> 08:15.176
And believe me,

08:15.248 --> 08:17.148
I've met every nut job in California.

08:17.217 --> 08:19.685
But when Kurt Pressman came
into my office five months ago

08:19.753 --> 08:21.243
with this vacuum,

08:23.590 --> 08:26.582
The world's first
self-cleaning vacuum cleaner,

08:27.327 --> 08:29.022
well, I knew I wanted to be part of it.

08:29.095 --> 08:30.790
Let's bring Kurt up right now.
He can tell us all about it.

08:30.864 --> 08:33.628
Kurt Pressman, ladies and
gentlemen, let's hear it.

08:33.700 --> 08:35.224
Well done, sir.

08:35.434 --> 08:37.198
That's it.
Give it up, people.

08:37.270 --> 08:38.897
Thank you, buddy.

08:39.371 --> 08:41.840
Self-cleaning vacuum.

08:43.176 --> 08:45.235
Do I wake or
do I dream?

08:45.779 --> 08:47.644
I don't know,
Mr. Monk.

08:50.250 --> 08:52.650
And where were you again
last night, Mr. Meckler?

08:52.719 --> 08:54.619
Last night? Uh,
I was working late.

08:54.688 --> 08:55.848
Got home
around 12:30.

08:55.922 --> 08:57.549
Yeah.
Yeah, 12:30.

08:57.624 --> 08:59.285
Here, use mine.

08:59.359 --> 09:01.327
Uh, no thanks,
I'm good.

09:01.428 --> 09:03.896
Did you see anything unusual last night?

09:03.964 --> 09:05.431
Were there any strangers
in the building?

09:05.498 --> 09:06.487
No. No, sir.

09:06.566 --> 09:07.999
What's all this about?

09:08.068 --> 09:09.433
Do you know
a Bradley Foster?

09:09.502 --> 09:10.594
Yeah, the janitor.

09:10.670 --> 09:12.137
Well, he was
murdered last night.

09:12.205 --> 09:13.263
We found him
in the basement.

09:13.340 --> 09:14.705
Oh, my God!

09:30.457 --> 09:32.652
<i>Consumer Currents.
You write for them?</i>

09:32.726 --> 09:33.920
Indeed.

09:34.127 --> 09:35.958
I bought my motorcycle last year

09:36.029 --> 09:39.157
because you guys recommended
it. You gave it five stars.

09:39.232 --> 09:40.256
How is it?

09:40.333 --> 09:42.392
It's five stars.
I love it.

09:42.469 --> 09:43.936
So, thank you.

09:44.637 --> 09:47.071
Choppers aren't
my department. I...

09:47.374 --> 09:49.205
I mainly cover
household appliances

09:49.275 --> 09:52.608
like blenders and
vacuum cleaners.

09:52.679 --> 09:55.148
But if you're in the market
for an energy efficient,

09:55.216 --> 09:57.116
three-cycle dishwasher
with a half-load option,

09:57.184 --> 09:58.651
I'm your gal.

10:00.287 --> 10:01.447
"T.K."

10:02.123 --> 10:04.091
What's the
"T" stand for?

10:04.158 --> 10:06.251
It stands for
my first name.

10:08.796 --> 10:10.388
Mr. Pressman,
excuse...

10:10.464 --> 10:11.931
Yeah. I'm sorry
to bother you.

10:11.999 --> 10:13.967
I just have to know,
how does it work?

10:14.035 --> 10:16.003
I mean, where does
all that dust go?

10:16.070 --> 10:18.163
It's a high voltage
electronic filter.

10:18.239 --> 10:20.139
It's in the brochure.
The dust is disintegrated.

10:20.207 --> 10:22.038
Yeah,
I didn't get a brochure.

10:22.109 --> 10:24.407
I'm here with the police. Police?

10:24.478 --> 10:29.541
Yeah, we're here about, um,
something else, completely unrelated,

10:29.617 --> 10:32.586
but I think the work
you're doing is historic.

10:32.653 --> 10:33.984
A self-cleaning vacuum

10:34.055 --> 10:36.649
is right up there
with the wheel, or Windex.

10:36.724 --> 10:38.089
Thank you, thank you...
Yeah. Hold on.

10:38.159 --> 10:39.854
Well, where can
I get one? Or two?

10:39.927 --> 10:41.155
Actually, I
could take two.

10:41.228 --> 10:43.856
We have a waiting list, and I'll
make sure you're on it, Mister...

10:43.931 --> 10:45.728
Monk.
Monk, excuse me.

10:46.567 --> 10:48.899
Sorry that took so long. It's all right.

10:48.969 --> 10:51.301
You had the diet, right? Mmm-hmm.

10:51.605 --> 10:52.867
I can't tell.
Is that diet?

10:52.940 --> 10:53.964
Oh.

10:54.608 --> 10:57.008
Mmm, diet, definitely. Diet? Great.

10:57.745 --> 10:59.838
Thanks. Pretty good turnout, huh?

10:59.914 --> 11:02.007
I told you, partner, you
build a better mousetrap...

11:02.083 --> 11:03.550
Oh, this is
Lieutenant Disher,

11:03.617 --> 11:04.743
he's with the
San Francisco police.

11:04.819 --> 11:07.617
Yeah, I heard
the police were here.

11:08.756 --> 11:09.848
Yeah.

11:10.291 --> 11:11.451
Trina?

11:12.259 --> 11:13.317
Theresa?

11:15.496 --> 11:17.088
Why do you care?

11:18.265 --> 11:19.960
Because it'll make
it slightly easier

11:20.034 --> 11:22.002
for me to
track you down.

11:23.604 --> 11:24.628
Oh.

11:30.478 --> 11:31.502
Don't touch it!

11:31.579 --> 11:33.809
Ow! It is a vacuum
cleaner. Don't... What...

11:33.881 --> 11:35.439
You're not
supposed to touch.

11:35.516 --> 11:36.574
Richard?

11:36.650 --> 11:37.639
Mr. Meckler?
Richard?

11:37.718 --> 11:38.742
I can't...

11:38.819 --> 11:40.218
Richard!

11:40.287 --> 11:42.312
Call 911. He's having a heart attack.

11:42.389 --> 11:43.913
Oh, my God.
Richard!

11:43.991 --> 11:45.481
Captain! Captain...
Richard.

11:45.559 --> 11:46.753
Step back, step back. Richard!

11:48.496 --> 11:49.861
Richard!
Doctor!

11:49.930 --> 11:51.955
Get me a doctor. Is there
a doctor in the house?

11:52.032 --> 11:55.763
Richard?
Richard? Richard?

11:55.836 --> 11:58.634
Help him! Help him! Oh, my God!

12:31.672 --> 12:32.900
Morning.

12:32.973 --> 12:34.497
Good morning.

12:34.575 --> 12:36.601
How did you sleep?
I was up all night

12:36.678 --> 12:39.272
thinking about that
poor man, that lawyer.

12:39.347 --> 12:42.976
I've never actually seen anyone
have a heart attack before.

12:43.151 --> 12:45.619
Oh, a new vacuum?
Where'd you get it?

12:45.687 --> 12:47.245
Oh, the, uh...

12:48.890 --> 12:51.916
The Captain met this reporter
from a consumer magazine.

12:51.993 --> 12:53.358
She let me
borrow it.

12:53.428 --> 12:54.520
Uh-huh.
And how is it?

12:54.596 --> 12:56.223
It's spectacular.

12:56.431 --> 12:57.591
See, there's
no dust bag.

12:57.666 --> 12:58.894
You don't have
to empty it.

12:58.967 --> 13:02.130
And if it picks up a
coin or something, look...

13:03.371 --> 13:05.168
There's a
little tray.

13:05.240 --> 13:07.037
See?
I think I'm in love.

13:07.108 --> 13:09.599
Oh, well, I'm sure you
two will be very happy.

13:09.678 --> 13:12.545
Yeah. Okay. Come on, the
Captain's waiting for us.

13:12.614 --> 13:14.411
Oh, I almost forgot, we just
have to stop off at my place.

13:14.482 --> 13:15.847
I forgot my cell phone.

13:15.917 --> 13:17.248
Excuse me.

13:28.363 --> 13:30.490
Oh, good. We found your phone.

13:31.199 --> 13:33.531
It was in your bag.
What are the odds?

13:33.602 --> 13:36.002
So, where are they?

13:36.071 --> 13:37.265
Are they at
your house?

13:37.339 --> 13:39.307
Come on, Mr. Monk, can't
you just come with me?

13:39.374 --> 13:42.605
Just... Just pretend
to be surprised.

13:42.677 --> 13:44.975
They're your friends. They're
waiting for you. They love you.

13:45.046 --> 13:47.014
They wanna do something
special for you.

13:47.082 --> 13:49.209
I can't. I can't.
I can't do it.

13:49.284 --> 13:50.683
Why?
Tell me why.

13:50.752 --> 13:51.912
There has
to be a reason.

13:51.987 --> 13:54.319
All right, I'll tell you,
but you can't tell anyone.

13:54.389 --> 13:56.448
I haven't even
told Dr. Bell.

13:56.524 --> 13:58.116
Okay, I promise.

14:24.219 --> 14:25.948
My God, what is it?

14:26.288 --> 14:27.949
All right.

14:29.591 --> 14:31.320
I was 10 years old,

14:33.595 --> 14:36.257
and there was
this cowboy.

14:38.166 --> 14:39.997
A cowboy?
Cowboy Hank.

14:41.002 --> 14:42.094
Okay.

14:43.938 --> 14:45.405
Oh, he was...

14:46.174 --> 14:49.337
He was on TV every
week and he was my hero.

14:51.780 --> 14:54.010
<i>Well, when I turned 10,
my mother surprised me.</i>

14:54.082 --> 14:58.018
<i>She hired Cowboy Hank
to come to my party.</i>

14:58.086 --> 15:00.281
<i>It must have cost her
every nickel she ever had.</i>

15:00.355 --> 15:02.323
<i>And, um, he, uh...</i>

15:05.727 --> 15:07.820
He brought
a rope with him.

15:08.930 --> 15:10.454
A rope?

15:10.532 --> 15:11.999
Like a lasso.

15:12.367 --> 15:13.732
Oh, my God.

15:14.836 --> 15:16.701
What did he
do with it?

15:17.539 --> 15:18.734
Tricks.

15:19.208 --> 15:22.041
<i>Some of the kids from
my class were there.</i>

15:22.345 --> 15:24.279
<i>Cowboy Hank was
really funny.</i>

15:24.347 --> 15:26.941
<i>He did all his tricks,
and he left.</i>

15:27.016 --> 15:28.074
<i>He left.</i>

15:28.150 --> 15:29.981
<i>As soon
as he was gone,</i>

15:30.052 --> 15:33.886
<i>all my friends, my
so-called friends, went home.</i>

15:36.625 --> 15:39.219
They didn't stay
for cake or anything.

15:41.030 --> 15:43.021
They didn't
care about me.

15:45.301 --> 15:48.737
They just wanted
to see Cowboy Hank.

15:52.108 --> 15:53.439
That's it?

15:54.510 --> 15:56.034
Everybody left.

15:56.312 --> 15:57.472
That's your story?

15:57.546 --> 15:59.480
Yeah.

16:00.282 --> 16:02.546
Oh, I'm so
throwing you a party.

16:02.985 --> 16:05.078
What? It's gonna be the
biggest party of the year.

16:05.154 --> 16:06.246
It's gonna be
a cotillion.

16:06.322 --> 16:07.755
We're gonna dance
until dawn.

16:07.823 --> 16:10.189
No, I can't. Not after what happened.

16:10.259 --> 16:12.352
Oh, Mr. Monk, that's the
stupidest story I ever heard.

16:12.428 --> 16:14.555
I'm sorry,
but that... It's lame.

16:14.630 --> 16:17.394
Everybody left? Well,
it was very traumatic.

16:17.466 --> 16:19.696
It's stupid! I mean, I have
worse stories than that.

16:19.769 --> 16:20.929
Everybody does.

16:21.003 --> 16:23.836
Wait, why can't you
tell Dr. Bell?

16:24.507 --> 16:26.065
I didn't think
he could handle it.

16:28.210 --> 16:29.939
I am so throwing
you a party,

16:30.012 --> 16:32.344
as God is my witness, and I'm
going to surprise you, too.

16:32.415 --> 16:34.542
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:35.317 --> 16:37.751
You're gonna
surprise me?

16:38.087 --> 16:39.679
You're not gonna
surprise me.

16:39.755 --> 16:40.847
Whoa.

16:41.590 --> 16:43.922
You don't think
I'm smart enough?

16:45.060 --> 16:48.086
It is so on.

16:48.164 --> 16:49.426
I'm throwing you
a party, boss.

16:49.498 --> 16:52.467
It could be
anytime, anywhere.

16:58.874 --> 17:00.398
So, what are
we looking for?

17:00.476 --> 17:01.943
I don't know.

17:02.711 --> 17:04.906
Somebody threw the guy
in a trash compactor.

17:04.980 --> 17:06.948
There has
to be a reason.

17:07.516 --> 17:09.176
How long did
he live here?

17:09.251 --> 17:11.242
<i>Eleven years.</i>

17:12.887 --> 17:14.013
I've got
a mouse pad

17:14.089 --> 17:15.920
and a surge protector,
but no computer.

17:15.991 --> 17:17.288
And I got a toolbox

17:17.358 --> 17:19.623
that looks like some tools are missing.

17:19.694 --> 17:20.752
Somebody's been here.

17:20.829 --> 17:23.263
Somebody's been
eating my porridge.

17:23.632 --> 17:25.122
Hey, thanks for coming.

17:25.800 --> 17:26.825
Uh, where's
your boss?

17:26.902 --> 17:28.300
Oh, he's in the hall.
He won't come in.

17:28.369 --> 17:30.668
He thinks it's
a surprise party.

17:31.941 --> 17:33.602
Monk, get in here.

17:45.120 --> 17:46.712
Thank you for coming.

17:46.789 --> 17:48.347
Looks like somebody's
been here.

17:48.424 --> 17:50.255
They took the computer
and maybe some tools.

17:50.326 --> 17:51.793
Uh-huh.

17:52.027 --> 17:54.825
Check that closet
while you're over there.

17:58.234 --> 17:59.895
Ah, no.

18:00.536 --> 18:03.335
I, uh...
I think I'll pass.

18:03.707 --> 18:04.696
You'll pass?

18:04.774 --> 18:06.799
Right, you think someone's in there?

18:06.877 --> 18:08.572
You think there are 50
people in that closet

18:08.645 --> 18:12.308
with balloons and party
hats waiting to jump out?

18:13.750 --> 18:15.980
Excuse me, do I need
to remind both of you

18:16.052 --> 18:18.077
that two nights ago
the man that lives here

18:18.154 --> 18:20.349
got torn apart in
a trash compactor?

18:20.423 --> 18:22.288
I bet he
was surprised.

18:22.592 --> 18:25.527
I know she's been trying
to throw you a party.

18:25.595 --> 18:26.823
And, um,

18:27.864 --> 18:29.092
she's going to.

18:29.165 --> 18:30.291
Oh, she's gonna
get you.

18:30.367 --> 18:31.425
I'm gonna get you.

18:31.501 --> 18:35.028
But this is a murder
victim's place of residence.

18:35.105 --> 18:37.369
Do you honestly think
that she would do it here?

18:37.440 --> 18:39.635
No, no, I don't.

18:40.577 --> 18:43.808
And that is
precisely why I do.

18:44.681 --> 18:48.117
And because I do, I don't. So yes, I do.

18:49.352 --> 18:50.444
Natalie, tell him.

18:50.520 --> 18:51.885
There is no party.

18:51.955 --> 18:55.220
Why is she smiling? Because
she's a friendly person.

18:56.660 --> 18:57.888
She winked. Come on, she's winking.

18:57.961 --> 18:59.861
Teeger, Teeger,
quit winking.

18:59.930 --> 19:01.261
Look, Monk, I...
She winked again!

19:01.331 --> 19:04.061
I need you to focus.
Randy, fill him in.

19:04.134 --> 19:06.227
Uh, Bradley Foster,

19:06.303 --> 19:08.897
graduated MIT, 1982.

19:08.972 --> 19:11.668
Worked for General
Electric for 10 years.

19:12.275 --> 19:14.334
Then he just disappeared,
fell off the radar.

19:14.411 --> 19:15.878
Apparently, he
started drinking,

19:15.946 --> 19:18.506
uh, washing dishes,
moving from job to job.

19:18.582 --> 19:20.140
He ended up living
here, pushing a broom.

19:20.216 --> 19:21.410
Uh-huh.

19:21.952 --> 19:23.715
I knew it.

19:23.954 --> 19:25.285
I knew it.

19:26.022 --> 19:28.616
Confetti!
Where are they?

19:28.858 --> 19:31.190
Okay, you can come
out, wherever you are.

19:31.261 --> 19:33.593
Monk, no, that's
not confetti.

19:33.663 --> 19:34.823
That's shredded paper.

19:34.898 --> 19:36.490
It's what we... See,
there's the shredder,

19:36.566 --> 19:38.193
right there. That's
material evidence.

19:38.268 --> 19:39.929
Let's put it back.

19:41.271 --> 19:42.602
Thank you.

20:01.524 --> 20:03.116
What do you got?

20:08.064 --> 20:09.691
It's been chewed.

20:09.899 --> 20:11.264
The lawyer.

20:11.401 --> 20:13.028
The heart attack?

20:13.403 --> 20:14.802
He was here.

20:26.449 --> 20:28.144
Mr. Monk, what
are you doing?

20:28.218 --> 20:30.550
Oh, you don't want me to look, do you?

20:30.620 --> 20:31.644
No, I don't.

20:31.721 --> 20:32.745
I wonder why.

20:32.822 --> 20:35.222
Because it's putrid and disgusting.

20:40.997 --> 20:42.521
You were right.

20:42.666 --> 20:44.658
We just ran a full toxicology screening.

20:44.735 --> 20:47.329
Richard Meckler was murdered. Poisoned.

20:47.471 --> 20:50.804
We found eight ccs of sodium
fluoroacetate in his blood stream.

20:50.875 --> 20:51.899
Sodium...

20:51.976 --> 20:53.466
Fluoroacetate.

20:54.245 --> 20:55.803
F- L-O...

20:55.880 --> 20:57.370
Fluoroacetate.

20:58.215 --> 20:59.648
I'm gonna write up
the notes later.

20:59.717 --> 21:01.981
We don't come across it
very often, thank God.

21:02.053 --> 21:04.146
It's extremely toxic
and fast-acting.

21:04.221 --> 21:05.848
Yeah, we know.
We were there.

21:05.923 --> 21:08.016
Another murder.
Coincidence?

21:08.526 --> 21:10.994
I don't
believe in coincidence.

21:11.062 --> 21:12.962
Okay, let's take
a step back.

21:13.030 --> 21:14.759
We got a janitor
who was killed.

21:14.832 --> 21:16.959
The only other guy in
the building is a lawyer

21:17.034 --> 21:18.399
named Richard Meckler.

21:18.469 --> 21:20.835
Ten hours later,
Meckler is poisoned.

21:20.905 --> 21:22.463
What do you
think, Monk?

21:22.540 --> 21:24.804
I don't believe in
coincidence either.

21:24.875 --> 21:29.005
And I also don't believe
in surprise parties.

21:32.416 --> 21:34.179
He has a big birthday tomorrow.

21:34.251 --> 21:35.411
Happy birthday.

21:35.486 --> 21:38.080
Uh, Doc, you said
that the, uh, sodium...

21:38.155 --> 21:39.247
Fluoroacetate.

21:39.323 --> 21:40.915
It was, uh,
fast-acting.

21:40.991 --> 21:42.015
That's right.

21:42.093 --> 21:45.256
Once you ingest it, you're
dead within 10 seconds.

21:45.696 --> 21:47.220
That doesn't
make sense.

21:47.298 --> 21:50.426
You know, I was... I was right
there. I was talking to the guy.

21:50.501 --> 21:51.798
I didn't
see anything.

21:51.869 --> 21:53.336
Neither...

21:53.404 --> 21:54.564
Did I!

21:57.808 --> 21:59.776
Can I just
say something?

21:59.844 --> 22:01.607
If this is my party,

22:02.580 --> 22:05.845
it's the second-worst
birthday party I've ever had.

22:14.191 --> 22:15.783
What's going on?

22:15.926 --> 22:18.258
The guy that died
yesterday was poisoned.

22:18.329 --> 22:20.854
Oh. So we're gonna recreate the crime.

22:21.499 --> 22:23.865
Well, why call me?
Am I a suspect?

22:23.934 --> 22:24.958
No.

22:25.236 --> 22:27.636
Am I important to the case in some way?

22:27.705 --> 22:29.502
Not particularly, no.

22:29.707 --> 22:33.302
Oh, so you were just looking
for an excuse to see me again.

22:33.377 --> 22:35.538
Miss Jensen,
if that were true,

22:35.613 --> 22:37.740
if I brought you down here
in the middle of the afternoon

22:37.815 --> 22:40.215
just to talk to you
and get to know you better,

22:40.284 --> 22:43.219
that would be a serious
abuse of my authority.

22:43.354 --> 22:45.083
It certainly would.

22:47.525 --> 22:49.015
Oh, Captain...

22:49.493 --> 22:50.892
Do you mind?

22:55.199 --> 22:57.360
Hey, Randy, Natalie,
this is T.K. Jensen.

22:57.434 --> 22:59.561
<i>She writes for Consumer
Currents magazine.</i>

22:59.637 --> 23:00.661
She was at the
event last night.

23:00.738 --> 23:01.796
I thought she might
be able to help.

23:01.872 --> 23:02.861
Hello.
Hi.

23:02.940 --> 23:04.567
Uh, what's "T.K."
Stand for?

23:04.642 --> 23:07.110
Mmm... She's taking the fifth on that.

23:10.080 --> 23:12.412
Okay, let's get
started. Captain,

23:12.716 --> 23:14.980
you're going to be
Richard Meckler.

23:15.052 --> 23:17.077
He was standing
right here.

23:17.354 --> 23:18.343
Right here.

23:18.422 --> 23:20.390
Natalie,
you're his wife,

23:20.524 --> 23:23.015
so you are standing
right there.

23:23.093 --> 23:24.822
What about me?

23:24.895 --> 23:26.158
You're you.

23:26.231 --> 23:27.562
But I'd rather
be Meckler.

23:27.632 --> 23:28.621
Why?

23:28.700 --> 23:29.724
He has more to do.

23:29.801 --> 23:31.462
Randy, you're you.

23:34.206 --> 23:35.537
All right.

23:36.208 --> 23:37.869
I am the inventor.

23:38.376 --> 23:39.775
I am Kurt Pressman.

23:39.845 --> 23:41.312
I'm sorry, I don't have a part for you.

23:41.379 --> 23:42.403
Oh. It's okay.

23:42.480 --> 23:43.572
Okay.

23:47.953 --> 23:51.218
I walk across the room
carrying two glasses of soda.

23:51.423 --> 23:52.412
I step up...

23:52.490 --> 23:54.390
That's right, he wasn't
sure which one was diet,

23:54.459 --> 23:56.086
so he took a sip.

23:57.195 --> 23:59.493
Then Meckler's wife
takes a sip.

24:00.799 --> 24:02.323
She took a sip.

24:03.535 --> 24:06.231
She gave the glass to
Meckler. He drank from it.

24:06.304 --> 24:08.431
Five minutes later,
he was dead.

24:10.141 --> 24:12.905
So how was he poisoned?
That's the question.

24:12.978 --> 24:14.036
It had to be
in the drink.

24:14.112 --> 24:15.636
No, no, that's...
That's impossible.

24:15.714 --> 24:16.772
You remember
what Dr. Z said,

24:16.848 --> 24:18.645
The poison hits
you like this,

24:18.717 --> 24:21.083
and he was sipping it
for at least five minutes.

24:21.152 --> 24:23.052
Besides, his wife
and Pressman

24:23.121 --> 24:24.713
both drank from
the same glass.

24:24.789 --> 24:25.949
They didn't
even get sick.

24:26.024 --> 24:27.286
So it wasn't
in the drink.

24:27.359 --> 24:28.917
Was he eating
something?

24:28.994 --> 24:30.018
No.

24:30.328 --> 24:31.625
Hmm. Wait a minute.

24:31.696 --> 24:33.926
He was chewing on his
pen, like a nervous habit.

24:33.999 --> 24:35.398
Nope, it wasn't
the pen.

24:35.467 --> 24:36.627
That was the first thing we checked.

24:36.701 --> 24:38.168
It was clean.

24:38.236 --> 24:40.602
Well, maybe somebody
injected him with something,

24:40.672 --> 24:42.572
like a...
Like a needle.

24:43.308 --> 24:45.276
No, I... I was there,
I would've seen that.

24:48.613 --> 24:51.081
A blow dart, you know, a poison dart.

24:51.149 --> 24:52.707
What
happened to the dart?

24:52.784 --> 24:54.479
It would have been
sticking in his neck.

24:54.552 --> 24:55.780
Not necessarily.

24:55.854 --> 24:57.549
There could have been
a long elastic wire

24:57.622 --> 24:59.647
attached to
the blow dart.

25:00.158 --> 25:01.750
They're called
dartarangs.

25:01.826 --> 25:04.659
How do you know they're
called "dartarangs"?

25:04.729 --> 25:06.959
Because they're probably
called dartarangs.

25:07.032 --> 25:09.592
Or at least, that's what
they should be called.

25:09.668 --> 25:12.034
Just nod your head
and say "maybe. "

25:12.103 --> 25:13.468
Maybe.
Interesting, Randy.

25:13.538 --> 25:15.130
Hmm.
Interesting.

25:17.075 --> 25:18.133
Hmm.

25:25.417 --> 25:27.282
Is the child safety
lock in the off position?

25:27.352 --> 25:28.410
Yes.

25:28.586 --> 25:29.985
Is the power
switch on?

25:30.055 --> 25:31.113
Yes.

25:31.456 --> 25:34.084
Is the cyclone cover
tightened securely?

25:34.159 --> 25:37.026
Cyclone cover, yes.

25:37.095 --> 25:39.290
I... I don't
understand it.

25:39.698 --> 25:41.063
It was working
perfectly.

25:41.132 --> 25:43.157
I was using it
all morning.

25:43.868 --> 25:46.359
I cleaned the filter,
and it just stopped.

25:46.438 --> 25:47.564
You cleaned
the what?

25:47.639 --> 25:49.402
I cleaned
the filter.

25:49.908 --> 25:52.843
You cleaned the air-actuated
ionized electronic filter?

25:52.911 --> 25:54.811
That's right. I always clean the filter.

25:54.879 --> 25:56.278
Mr. Monk, it says,
"Do not clean the filter. "

25:56.348 --> 25:57.508
Where?

25:57.682 --> 26:00.742
Here, here,
here, here.

26:01.052 --> 26:02.144
Here.

26:02.253 --> 26:05.120
I saw that, but it
didn't make any sense.

26:05.190 --> 26:07.283
You always
clean the filter.

26:07.927 --> 26:09.918
What
did I do?

26:10.830 --> 26:12.320
What did I do?

26:14.700 --> 26:16.167
I'm so sorry.

26:17.136 --> 26:18.398
So sorry.

26:19.472 --> 26:22.168
It's true
what they say,

26:23.175 --> 26:24.972
"The good die young. "

26:29.548 --> 26:31.140
Not this vacuum.

26:31.584 --> 26:33.176
Take me instead.

26:33.486 --> 26:35.113
I'm sure we can find somebody to fix it.

26:35.187 --> 26:37.121
Nobody
can fix it!

26:37.189 --> 26:39.214
It's not even
in the stores yet.

26:39.291 --> 26:40.519
Oh, God!

26:41.427 --> 26:42.519
Wait.

26:42.828 --> 26:45.661
Wait, wait, wait.
The guy, the inventor.

26:45.931 --> 26:48.058
Kurt Pressman? Yeah.
Yeah, he can fix it.

26:48.134 --> 26:51.194
His address is right on
the back of the booklet.

26:51.604 --> 26:52.866
"603 Vinton Street. "

26:52.938 --> 26:54.132
We can be there
in 20 minutes.

26:54.206 --> 26:56.197
No. We can't go now.
You have Dr. Bell at 2:00.

26:56.275 --> 26:57.606
Oh, I'll call
him and cancel.

26:57.676 --> 27:00.008
No, I don't think it's a
good idea. I mean, not today.

27:00.079 --> 27:01.068
Why not?

27:01.147 --> 27:03.877
Because you seem really anxious lately.

27:03.949 --> 27:05.348
You have that big case, the janitor.

27:05.418 --> 27:08.285
Plus the poisoned lawyer,
so that's two big cases.

27:08.354 --> 27:10.584
You're under
a lot of pressure.

27:10.856 --> 27:12.585
I don't believe it.

27:12.958 --> 27:14.687
What?
I don't believe it.

27:14.760 --> 27:16.489
You are diabolical.

27:16.829 --> 27:19.593
You're planning a surprise
party in Dr. Bell's office.

27:19.665 --> 27:22.725
My therapist's office!
Have you no shame?

27:23.669 --> 27:25.534
It's not
in his office.

27:27.073 --> 27:28.199
It's in the
office next door.

27:28.274 --> 27:30.572
I rented it out.
Everybody's waiting.

27:30.643 --> 27:32.008
They're already there.
Please, Mr. Monk.

27:32.078 --> 27:33.409
Please just...
Just come with me.

27:33.479 --> 27:34.503
It'll take
just an hour.

27:36.282 --> 27:38.011
Told you before,
I can't do it.

27:38.084 --> 27:39.642
What, because of
Cowboy Hank?

27:39.718 --> 27:42.243
Cowboy Hank. Because of one bad party.

27:42.988 --> 27:45.286
Okay, Mr. Monk,
congratulations.

27:45.691 --> 27:48.182
You win. You're gonna
spend your birthday alone.

27:48.260 --> 27:49.852
And the next
birthday after that.

27:49.929 --> 27:51.396
And the one
after that, too.

27:51.464 --> 27:53.989
Until you finally
die alone

27:54.066 --> 27:58.002
and pathetic and miserable
and sad and alone.

28:00.039 --> 28:02.303
Deal. Can we fix
the vacuum now?

28:06.812 --> 28:08.109
Hello?

28:08.180 --> 28:09.408
In here.

28:12.685 --> 28:13.777
Hello.

28:13.853 --> 28:15.582
Mr. Monk, Natalie.

28:15.654 --> 28:18.782
I already spoke to your colleague,
Lieutenant Disher, earlier.

28:18.858 --> 28:21.326
Actually, that's
not why we're here.

28:23.162 --> 28:25.858
It broke. It...
It just stopped working.

28:26.799 --> 28:29.131
You mean, you're not
here about Richard?

28:29.201 --> 28:31.294
Could you have a look?
Lt'll just take a minute.

28:31.370 --> 28:32.803
I don't think
I can think about work.

28:32.872 --> 28:34.703
Not now, not after
what happened.

28:34.773 --> 28:36.172
It's just...

28:37.109 --> 28:38.371
Richard was
more than my lawyer.

28:38.444 --> 28:39.809
He was one of
my oldest friends.

28:39.879 --> 28:42.245
I've known him
since high school.

28:42.314 --> 28:43.679
I just can't
believe he's gone.

28:43.749 --> 28:45.614
I can appreciate that.

28:45.985 --> 28:47.043
It was a terrible thing.

28:47.119 --> 28:49.815
We're very sorry for
your loss. Aren't we?

28:49.890 --> 28:50.982
Yes.

28:53.660 --> 28:54.957
But as long
as we're here...

28:57.664 --> 28:59.029
It just
stopped working?

28:59.099 --> 29:01.124
Yeah. He cleaned the filter.

29:02.435 --> 29:03.595
Well, you're not supposed
to clean the filter.

29:03.670 --> 29:04.694
I know that now.

29:04.771 --> 29:06.932
We wrote it as big as we
could in the instruction book.

29:07.007 --> 29:08.634
It was the biggest
font we had.

29:08.708 --> 29:10.039
It was big.

29:10.110 --> 29:12.010
All right,
let's take a look.

29:12.078 --> 29:13.705
Great, thank you.

29:15.649 --> 29:17.310
Thank you so much.

29:21.488 --> 29:23.115
So this is, uh...

29:23.823 --> 29:25.484
This is where
you invented it?

29:25.559 --> 29:29.086
Yes, sir. Worked on the
prototype for five years.

29:29.429 --> 29:30.987
Five years?
Hmm.

29:31.531 --> 29:33.761
Well, you know what
Thomas Edison said,

29:33.833 --> 29:36.028
"Invention is
1% inspiration

29:36.102 --> 29:38.764
"and 99% perspiration. "

29:38.838 --> 29:40.135
I have a theory.

29:40.207 --> 29:43.608
I think Edison said
that to explain his B.O.

29:46.980 --> 29:49.608
Uh... I need
a Phillips-head.

29:49.683 --> 29:52.413
You know... You know,
the perspiration...

29:53.987 --> 29:57.150
I gather from the Lieutenant
that you don't think

29:57.224 --> 29:59.158
Richard died
of natural causes.

29:59.226 --> 30:01.888
Oh, we can't talk about
the case, you understand.

30:01.962 --> 30:03.020
Ah.

30:03.230 --> 30:04.254
He mentioned
another case.

30:04.331 --> 30:06.390
A janitor you feel
might be connected?

30:06.466 --> 30:08.832
It's possible. It's a work in progress.

30:08.902 --> 30:10.870
Yeah, Mr. Monk always says,
"It's a work in progress"

30:10.937 --> 30:12.495
just before he
figures it all out.

30:13.640 --> 30:14.766
Really?

30:14.841 --> 30:17.401
So, how does
she look?

30:17.744 --> 30:19.939
Well, you were right.
It's the filter.

30:20.013 --> 30:21.105
Yeah.

30:21.314 --> 30:23.282
I can't replace it now. It
will take a couple of days.

30:23.350 --> 30:25.784
Oh, so, Friday?

30:26.586 --> 30:28.554
Friday is
Richard's funeral.

30:28.622 --> 30:29.953
What time?

30:30.323 --> 30:31.347
Noon.

30:31.424 --> 30:35.224
So you're home
when? 2:30, 2:45?

30:36.329 --> 30:37.455
How about this?
I'll call you.

30:37.530 --> 30:38.519
Yeah, that
sounds great.

30:38.598 --> 30:41.089
Thank you so much for
letting us just drop by.

30:41.167 --> 30:42.191
Thank you.
Yes.

30:42.269 --> 30:44.760
And God bless you
and your work.

30:49.743 --> 30:51.005
All right,
how about this?

30:51.077 --> 30:52.066
It won't be a party.

30:52.145 --> 30:54.579
I mean, not technically.
It'll just be me and Julie.

30:54.648 --> 30:56.479
We'll come over tonight and
we'll have a birthday cake

30:56.549 --> 30:57.675
and a couple of candles.

30:57.751 --> 30:59.048
I don't
want a cake.

30:59.119 --> 31:01.280
Okay, fine, uh,
how about a cupcake?

31:01.354 --> 31:03.379
One cupcake
and one candle.

31:03.556 --> 31:04.750
Crumbs.

31:04.991 --> 31:08.188
Okay, a plastic cupcake,
a picture of a candle,

31:08.261 --> 31:11.059
and I promise we won't
have any fun at all.

31:12.532 --> 31:13.760
You know
what I want?

31:13.833 --> 31:14.993
What I really want?

31:15.068 --> 31:16.501
What?
Just name it.

31:16.569 --> 31:17.593
I want you to
make a left turn.

31:17.671 --> 31:20.003
A left turn? Right now. Turn here.

31:20.273 --> 31:21.297
Why?
What's going on?

31:21.374 --> 31:23.308
We're
being followed.

31:23.376 --> 31:25.867
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What do I do?

31:29.716 --> 31:31.240
That's the Captain.

31:31.318 --> 31:32.343
<i>Are you guys okay?</i>

31:32.420 --> 31:33.910
We're being followed.

31:33.988 --> 31:35.853
<i>Is it a black SUV?
Yes.</i>

31:35.923 --> 31:37.220
<i>Nevada plates?
Yes.</i>

31:37.291 --> 31:39.589
<i>Okay, stay calm.
We just got word</i>

31:39.660 --> 31:42.686
<i>that somebody put out a
$20,000 contract on your life.</i>

31:42.763 --> 31:43.855
A contract?

31:43.931 --> 31:45.956
Both of us,
or just him?

31:47.201 --> 31:48.190
What was that?

31:48.269 --> 31:49.759
Those are gunshots.
Go, go, go, go!

31:49.837 --> 31:52.203
Which way?
Away from the bullets!

32:25.573 --> 32:27.063
Wrong way, wrong way, wrong way!

32:27.141 --> 32:28.938
Well, how do you know?
It says, "Wrong way. "

32:29.009 --> 32:30.237
Oh, God.

32:38.386 --> 32:39.648
Whoa, whoa!

32:39.720 --> 32:42.280
Help us. You gotta help
us. They're after us.

32:45.192 --> 32:47.387
Oh, my God.
This way!

32:52.166 --> 32:53.394
Come on!

32:57.371 --> 32:58.463
Uh...

32:59.173 --> 33:00.367
The dumpster.
The dumpster.

33:00.441 --> 33:01.669
No, I can't.

33:01.742 --> 33:03.266
The port-a-john.

33:03.344 --> 33:04.777
Have we met?

33:04.845 --> 33:06.278
Mr. Monk, you have to choose.

33:06.347 --> 33:07.473
I choose death.

33:07.548 --> 33:10.073
Hey, they're down here. Go, go, go, go!

33:10.151 --> 33:12.381
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go.

33:18.325 --> 33:19.519
Why did you
close it?

33:19.593 --> 33:21.356
Because
we're hiding.

33:22.496 --> 33:24.157
Can I change my mind?

33:24.799 --> 33:25.857
I'll take the
port-a-john.

33:39.280 --> 33:40.907
What do
we do with them?

33:40.981 --> 33:42.676
Let's dump
them in the river.

33:42.750 --> 33:45.184
I hope they're not talking about us.

33:45.686 --> 33:47.984
Come on out,
both of you.

33:48.789 --> 33:51.019
Let me see your hands. Hands up.

33:52.526 --> 33:53.823
Got any last words?

33:53.894 --> 33:55.225
Yes, I do.

33:55.463 --> 33:57.658
There's something
I wanna say.

34:01.168 --> 34:02.567
Happy birthday,
Mr. Monk.

34:02.636 --> 34:04.729
Surprise!

34:14.415 --> 34:15.849
Gotcha!

34:18.018 --> 34:19.043
Thank you.

34:19.120 --> 34:20.246
Man, you should have seen your face.

34:20.322 --> 34:21.914
Yeah, I should've seen my face.

34:21.989 --> 34:23.116
Are you okay?
You're not mad, are you?

34:23.190 --> 34:24.385
No, I'm okay.

34:24.458 --> 34:27.292
Hey, man.
Happy birthday.

34:27.596 --> 34:29.154
So, were you
surprised?

34:29.231 --> 34:31.199
Oh, yes, yes.
Yes, I was.

34:31.333 --> 34:33.266
I cannot believe you
got him in that dumpster.

34:33.335 --> 34:34.802
I know. You guys
were great.

34:34.870 --> 34:36.268
Where'd you
get that SUV?

34:36.338 --> 34:37.327
From the
impound lot.

34:37.405 --> 34:39.532
Uh-huh, very funny,
very funny.

34:39.608 --> 34:42.371
With the car chase and
the gunshots. Very amusing.

34:42.444 --> 34:44.411
And when the
guard got shot,

34:44.478 --> 34:46.413
that almost
looked real.

34:46.481 --> 34:48.108
Well, that was real.
We had to kill the guard.

34:48.183 --> 34:50.514
We had to make
it look authentic.

34:50.719 --> 34:52.118
What do you mean?

34:52.187 --> 34:55.418
It was fake blood.

34:55.489 --> 34:56.922
It was Pat. Pat,
he's right there.

34:56.992 --> 34:58.755
I knew it!
I knew it.

35:01.530 --> 35:03.896
Mr. Monk?
Look who I found.

35:03.965 --> 35:05.796
Your hero.
I had to invite him.

35:05.867 --> 35:08.028
I wouldn't have missed
it. Happy birthday, Monk.

35:08.103 --> 35:09.832
Happy...
Happy birthday.

35:09.905 --> 35:11.896
Hey. Hey, Natalie, Monk, come here.

35:11.973 --> 35:13.099
Yeah,
don't go away.

35:13.174 --> 35:15.074
This, uh... This'll
just take a second.

35:15.143 --> 35:16.474
Say hello

35:16.545 --> 35:19.275
to the guy that
sold the whole thing.

35:19.881 --> 35:22.042
Natalie Teeger,
Adrian Monk...

35:22.117 --> 35:23.709
Very good.

35:30.425 --> 35:31.449
Hi.

35:32.928 --> 35:34.555
Hey. Here.

35:34.629 --> 35:37.120
Thanks. Well, thank you for coming.

35:37.198 --> 35:38.290
I love your parties.

35:38.366 --> 35:39.390
Although,
I have to say,

35:39.467 --> 35:40.559
if nobody gets
shot or poisoned,

35:40.635 --> 35:43.069
I'm going to be
very disappointed.

36:07.696 --> 36:10.995
And many more.

36:16.204 --> 36:17.262
Come on, Mr. Monk,
make a wish.

36:17.339 --> 36:18.499
No. I don't
really think...

36:18.573 --> 36:21.667
Come on!
Monk, make a wish.

36:22.110 --> 36:23.202
Okay.

36:33.822 --> 36:35.687
You loosened
your belt.

36:35.857 --> 36:37.984
I'm making room
for the cake.

36:38.493 --> 36:40.358
You loosened
your belt.

36:40.662 --> 36:41.651
Excuse me?

36:41.730 --> 36:43.027
Your tool belt.

36:43.098 --> 36:46.033
<i>It didn't fit,
and I saw you loosen it.</i>

36:47.602 --> 36:48.830
I need a Phillips-head.

36:48.903 --> 36:51.098
<i>You didn't even
know what tool to use.</i>

36:51.873 --> 36:54.774
It wasn't your belt,
was it?

36:57.480 --> 36:59.277
I know what happened.

36:59.482 --> 37:01.382
I know the whole story.

37:01.517 --> 37:02.916
The janitor,

37:03.853 --> 37:07.220
Bradley Foster,
the engineer from MIT.

37:07.289 --> 37:09.257
He was the
real inventor.

37:09.925 --> 37:12.792
<i>He took the idea to Richard
Meckler, which made sense.</i>

37:12.862 --> 37:15.763
<i>Meckler was a patent lawyer
in that same building.</i>

37:15.831 --> 37:17.731
<i>Self-cleaning vacuum.</i>

37:17.800 --> 37:20.894
<i>Fourth-greatest invention
since the dawn of man.</i>

37:21.237 --> 37:23.705
Meckler knew it would
be worth a fortune.

37:23.773 --> 37:26.241
You and Meckler
were old pals.

37:26.509 --> 37:27.942
You were
in it together.

37:28.010 --> 37:30.069
He killed Foster
in the trash compactor,

37:30.146 --> 37:32.910
and you were
the beard.

37:32.982 --> 37:35.075
You were the
phony inventor.

37:35.685 --> 37:38.483
Meckler was greedy,
but you were greedier.

37:38.921 --> 37:41.082
You decided you didn't need a partner,

37:41.157 --> 37:43.216
so you killed him.

37:43.626 --> 37:46.060
You poisoned him
at that reception.

37:46.128 --> 37:47.993
I poisoned
Richard Meckler?

37:48.064 --> 37:49.122
How?

37:49.532 --> 37:51.625
You were there.
So were you.

37:51.801 --> 37:52.859
You brought
him his drink.

37:52.935 --> 37:54.459
It must have been
in the drink.

37:54.537 --> 37:56.528
I drank from it,
remember?

37:57.073 --> 37:58.836
From the same glass.

38:05.614 --> 38:07.104
The ice cubes.

38:07.850 --> 38:10.375
The ice cubes.
Mine are square.

38:11.654 --> 38:13.246
These are round.

38:14.256 --> 38:15.723
So are yours.

38:19.462 --> 38:21.589
It must have been
in the ice cubes.

38:21.664 --> 38:23.188
I'll take that.

38:24.233 --> 38:25.996
That's how you could
drink from the same glass.

38:26.068 --> 38:28.628
The ice hadn't
melted yet.

38:29.105 --> 38:31.232
Randy,
cuff him.

38:32.007 --> 38:34.407
Don't need handcuffs.

38:37.413 --> 38:39.813
There you go, son,
take him away.

38:42.017 --> 38:43.041
Cowboy Hank!

38:43.119 --> 38:45.087
He was available.
Can you believe it?

38:45.154 --> 38:47.179
Sorry I'm late,
buckaroos.

38:47.256 --> 38:50.089
Okay, who's the
birthday boy?

38:50.760 --> 38:52.284
Monk.
I am.

38:53.662 --> 38:56.893
Well, rattle my saddle.
Happy birthday, son.

38:57.900 --> 38:59.800
Thank you, Hank.

39:05.474 --> 39:07.908
Yeah, there
you go!

39:09.411 --> 39:11.572
Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

39:11.647 --> 39:13.376
Well, I guess it's time for Cowboy Hank

39:13.449 --> 39:15.041
to be moseying
down the trail

39:15.117 --> 39:17.210
back to the old
cowboy home.

39:17.620 --> 39:18.712
Now listen, Adrian,

39:18.788 --> 39:20.983
I want you to keep
your spurs clean, huh?

39:21.056 --> 39:23.024
I don't think you have
to worry about that.

39:23.092 --> 39:25.185
Thank you
very much, ma'am.

39:32.034 --> 39:34.502
Well, never
a dull moment.

39:36.105 --> 39:38.505
Hey. Give me
another chance.

39:38.574 --> 39:41.100
I want to have
dull moments with you.

39:42.279 --> 39:44.247
How about
Saturday night?

39:46.483 --> 39:47.575
Okay.

39:48.084 --> 39:49.711
And Sunday night.

39:50.086 --> 39:51.075
Sunday night, too?

39:51.154 --> 39:52.178
Yep.

39:52.255 --> 39:54.348
I don't know.
I mean, uh...

39:55.425 --> 39:57.757
Maybe we ought
to tap the brakes.

39:57.994 --> 40:00.121
I'm sorry, but my brakes are shot.

40:01.531 --> 40:04.364
And besides, I don't want to slow down.

40:04.768 --> 40:06.395
I haven't felt...

40:07.938 --> 40:10.668
Hell, I have... I've
never felt like this.

40:13.743 --> 40:16.041
And I don't even
know your name.

40:17.180 --> 40:18.545
It's Trudy.

40:20.183 --> 40:21.673
Your name
is Trudy?

40:21.751 --> 40:25.448
Yeah, it's... No, wait,
your... Your name's Trudy?

40:25.655 --> 40:26.917
Yeah.

40:26.990 --> 40:27.979
Oh, that's not
gonna work.

40:28.058 --> 40:29.047
What?

40:29.125 --> 40:31.423
Well, it's...
It's a long story.

40:31.962 --> 40:34.954
Let's just stick with
T.K., okay? T.K. Is cute.

40:35.298 --> 40:37.458
Okay.

40:42.772 --> 40:44.603
For the record, Cowboy Hank went home,

40:44.674 --> 40:46.107
and everybody's
still here.

40:46.176 --> 40:48.406
They're here
for you, Mr. Monk.

40:48.511 --> 40:49.603
Hey, you guys,
we had a great time.

40:49.679 --> 40:50.668
You're not leaving.

40:50.747 --> 40:51.839
Okay.

40:53.049 --> 40:56.450
Natalie, this was the
best birthday I ever had.

40:57.621 --> 40:58.645
Thank you.
You're welcome.

40:58.722 --> 41:00.212
Don't do it again.

41:00.290 --> 41:02.258
Happy birthday,
Mr. Monk.
