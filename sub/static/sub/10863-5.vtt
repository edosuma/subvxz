00:30.400 --> 00:31.320
Hey, guys.

00:31.320 --> 00:32.479
Hey.
Hey.

00:33.520 --> 00:35.440
Hey! What's
the rush, Slick?

00:35.440 --> 00:37.920
Betty Ann's up tonight.

00:37.920 --> 00:40.920
I told him Betty Ann
tells really weird stories,

00:40.920 --> 00:43.960
and he's been looking
forward to it ever since.

00:43.960 --> 00:46.600
Ooh! Pressure's on.
This better be good.

00:46.600 --> 00:48.760
I'll see what I can do.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.880
A doll? You're telling
a doll story?

00:58.880 --> 01:00.120
Weak!

01:00.120 --> 01:01.600
Siesta time, man.

01:01.600 --> 01:04.200
Wake me up
if it gets good.

01:05.239 --> 01:06.360
Come on, Tuck!

01:06.360 --> 01:08.000
It's OK.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.640
Let him sleep.

01:12.280 --> 01:15.240
Most people think dolls
are just toys.

01:15.240 --> 01:18.240
But they're really like
perfect little people.

01:18.240 --> 01:21.400
Sometimes,
they're so lifelike,

01:21.400 --> 01:24.400
that it's almost as if
the dollmaker took a person

01:24.400 --> 01:27.400
and shrunk him down
to doll size.

01:27.400 --> 01:30.480
But that's not how dolls
are really made.

01:31.960 --> 01:33.440
Or is it?

01:41.720 --> 01:44.920
Submitted for the approval
of the Midnight Society,

01:44.920 --> 01:46.960
I call this story...

02:01.480 --> 02:03.360
<i> Ever since she could
remember,</i>

02:03.360 --> 02:05.360
<i> Melissa spent weekends
now and then</i>

02:05.360 --> 02:08.199
<i> at her aunt and uncle's
house in the country.</i>

02:08.199 --> 02:09.560
<i> The first few visits,</i>

02:09.560 --> 02:11.560
<i> it was pretty much
a total drag.</i>

02:11.560 --> 02:13.040
<i> But then the Hendersons</i>

02:13.040 --> 02:14.640
<i> moved in next door.</i>

02:14.640 --> 02:17.600
<i> Even though they only saw each
other a few times each year,</i>

02:17.600 --> 02:20.640
<i> Melissa and Susan Henderson
quickly became best friends.</i>

02:20.640 --> 02:23.440
Where's Susan? Thought she'd
be here waiting for me.

02:23.440 --> 02:26.320
You told her when I
was coming, didn't you?

02:26.320 --> 02:28.360
I'm sorry, Melissa,
but...

02:28.360 --> 02:31.560
The Hendersons moved back
to town early this spring.

02:31.560 --> 02:34.880
But why?
They love this place!

02:34.880 --> 02:35.880
Well--

02:35.880 --> 02:37.920
We don't exactly
know why, hon.

02:39.240 --> 02:41.360
Come on. Let's get
you settled in.

02:41.360 --> 02:43.000
You must be famished!

02:50.440 --> 02:51.880
Yeah.

02:51.880 --> 02:52.630
OK.

02:54.960 --> 02:56.360
No, Mom.
The trip was fine.

02:56.360 --> 02:58.560
But the Hendersons
have moved.

03:01.160 --> 03:02.800
Susan Henderson?
Remember?

03:02.800 --> 03:04.960
We hung out all the time.

03:06.240 --> 03:09.160
Now I've got nothing to do
all weekend.

03:09.160 --> 03:12.800
Aunt Sally and Uncle Pete
don't even have cable.

03:12.800 --> 03:14.360
OK, OK.

03:14.360 --> 03:15.840
I love you, too.

03:15.840 --> 03:17.320
Yeah. Bye. Bye.

03:17.320 --> 03:18.920
Bye!

03:20.200 --> 03:21.640
Hurry up, sweetie.

03:21.640 --> 03:23.800
We don't want to
be late for bingo.

03:23.800 --> 03:25.040
Bingo!

03:34.400 --> 03:35.840
Hey, Melissa,

03:35.840 --> 03:38.840
I got some work to
do on the septic tank.

03:38.840 --> 03:40.320
Wanna lend a hand?

03:40.320 --> 03:41.840
Septic tank.

03:41.840 --> 03:43.320
Gee, sounds like
fun,

03:43.320 --> 03:45.320
but, uh...
No thanks.

03:45.320 --> 03:46.520
[Chuckles]
Suit yourself.

04:29.440 --> 04:30.600
Hello?

04:31.840 --> 04:33.240
Anybody here?

04:36.240 --> 04:37.640
Hello.

04:46.880 --> 04:48.280
Hello.

04:48.280 --> 04:50.040
Anybody up there?

04:53.360 --> 04:54.800
Hello?

04:54.800 --> 04:56.480
Anybody here?

04:58.880 --> 04:59.800
Hello?

04:59.800 --> 05:01.920
[Creaking]

05:08.720 --> 05:10.240
Anybody here?

05:10.240 --> 05:11.240
Hello?

05:11.240 --> 05:12.720
[Creaking]

05:28.800 --> 05:30.600
Oh, cool!

05:47.080 --> 05:48.920
Oh, wow!

06:12.120 --> 06:13.400
[Gasps]

06:19.840 --> 06:21.920
Oh, probably just a mouse.

06:26.280 --> 06:28.360
[Coughing]

06:47.520 --> 06:49.240
Melissa!

06:49.240 --> 06:52.640
I really don't think you should
be snooping around up here.

06:52.640 --> 06:54.160
Now come on!

06:54.160 --> 06:55.640
I'm not snooping
around.

06:55.640 --> 06:57.240
The front door
was unlocked,

06:57.240 --> 06:58.480
so I just...

06:58.480 --> 07:01.080
I thought maybe Susan
had come back.

07:01.080 --> 07:03.960
What on earth would
make you think that?

07:03.960 --> 07:06.400
I saw someone
in the window.

07:06.400 --> 07:08.160
Oh...

07:08.160 --> 07:09.680
You probably saw me.

07:09.680 --> 07:11.400
Now come on!

07:13.720 --> 07:14.720
Come on!

07:21.760 --> 07:24.680
Now I want you
to give me your word

07:24.680 --> 07:27.680
that you won't ever
come over here again.

07:27.680 --> 07:29.160
Why not?

07:29.160 --> 07:32.160
Because the Hendersons asked
us to watch over the place,

07:32.160 --> 07:35.160
and it's not a
responsibility I take lightly.

07:35.160 --> 07:38.200
They left a lot of
precious things behind.

07:38.200 --> 07:41.200
Like what, a bunch of
old furniture and stuff?

07:41.200 --> 07:44.240
Well, that dollhouse alone
must be worth a fortune.

07:44.240 --> 07:46.680
It's nothing for
a child to play with.

07:46.680 --> 07:49.240
Can I look at the
dollhouse, please?

07:49.240 --> 07:51.240
Oh, Melissa,
I don't know.

07:51.240 --> 07:54.200
I'd rather you kept
away after what happened.

07:54.200 --> 07:56.200
After what?
What happened?

07:56.200 --> 07:58.560
Aunt Sally,
what happened?

08:01.440 --> 08:02.640
Aunt Sally!

08:09.680 --> 08:13.120
I suppose you had to
find out sooner or later.

08:13.120 --> 08:14.240
Melissa...

08:14.240 --> 08:16.920
The Hendersons
didn't just move away.

08:16.920 --> 08:20.120
Last winter...

08:20.120 --> 08:21.760
Susan disappeared.

08:21.760 --> 08:24.360
What do you mean,
disappeared?

08:24.360 --> 08:27.360
No one knows what
happened to her.

08:27.360 --> 08:29.360
One minute
she was there,

08:29.360 --> 08:31.360
and the next...

08:31.360 --> 08:32.840
She was gone.

08:33.880 --> 08:35.919
The whole town
came out.

08:37.200 --> 08:38.960
We searched everywhere.

08:41.039 --> 08:43.039
Her parents
were heartbroken.

08:44.720 --> 08:48.160
They wanted to stay in
case she came back, but...

08:48.160 --> 08:50.080
In the end,
they couldn't stand

08:50.080 --> 08:53.160
to live in that
house any longer.

08:53.160 --> 08:55.160
Too many memories.

08:56.440 --> 08:58.000
They're keeping it,
though,

08:58.000 --> 09:01.040
just in case she
ever comes back.

09:03.280 --> 09:04.920
Come on, sweetie.

09:04.920 --> 09:06.760
Let's go in.

09:27.680 --> 09:29.600
Pete: You shouldn't
have lied to her

09:29.600 --> 09:32.120
about the Henderson
girl in the first place.

09:32.120 --> 09:34.120
I didn't want to
ruin her weekend.

09:34.120 --> 09:36.120
You didn't tell her
what Marge Henderson

09:36.120 --> 09:38.120
said about
the house, did you?

09:38.120 --> 09:41.120
Shh! She might hear you!
No, of course not.

09:41.120 --> 09:43.120
Anyway, Marge was
beside herself with grief.

09:43.120 --> 09:45.120
She didn't know
what she was saying.

09:45.120 --> 09:47.600
Maybe not, but she
said it pretty clearly.

09:47.600 --> 09:49.640
It was the house
that got her!

09:49.640 --> 09:51.600
That's
what she said.

10:05.200 --> 10:07.120
<i>[Girl's voice whispers]
Melissa.</i>

10:12.480 --> 10:14.640
<i> Melissa.</i>

10:19.520 --> 10:21.960
<i> Melissa, help me.</i>

11:30.040 --> 11:31.360
Cool.

12:12.120 --> 12:14.160
Melissa?

12:16.760 --> 12:18.000
Susan!

12:19.640 --> 12:20.720
Melissa?

12:23.000 --> 12:25.440
Susan, you're going
the wrong way!

12:27.120 --> 12:28.480
Melissa?

12:29.880 --> 12:30.880
No!

12:30.880 --> 12:32.280
Aah!

12:32.280 --> 12:33.400
Uncle Pete!

12:33.400 --> 12:35.360
Melissa,
are you all right?

12:35.360 --> 12:36.880
Yes,
but it's Susan--

12:36.880 --> 12:38.880
she's still here
in the house!

12:38.880 --> 12:39.880
Melissa...

12:39.880 --> 12:41.840
Please let me go!
I saw her!

12:41.840 --> 12:43.400
Melissa,
listen to me!

12:43.400 --> 12:44.520
Come here.

12:46.640 --> 12:47.640
Look.

13:11.400 --> 13:15.200
Lord knows why that
door was ever up there

13:15.200 --> 13:16.480
in the first place.

13:16.480 --> 13:19.360
They should have
boarded it up long ago.

13:19.360 --> 13:22.440
I'm sure I saw her... at
the end of a long corridor.

13:22.440 --> 13:24.760
There was this
weird light...

13:24.760 --> 13:26.280
Honey...

13:26.280 --> 13:28.800
I know finding out
about Susan

13:28.800 --> 13:30.280
was a shock.

13:30.280 --> 13:32.800
I wasn't dreaming
or sleepwalking.

13:32.800 --> 13:36.000
It was as real as--

13:36.000 --> 13:38.160
[hammering]

13:39.240 --> 13:41.720
If Uncle Pete
boards up that door,

13:41.720 --> 13:44.240
Susan will never
be able to get out.

13:44.240 --> 13:46.720
Melissa! Listen to
what you're saying.

13:46.720 --> 13:49.920
What on earth would she
be doing in the attic

13:49.920 --> 13:51.640
after all this time?

13:51.640 --> 13:53.400
I don't know.

15:30.760 --> 15:31.720
Susan?

15:31.720 --> 15:33.680
Susan, are you in here?

16:03.800 --> 16:05.920
Susan, where are you?

16:14.320 --> 16:15.520
Susan?

16:18.800 --> 16:20.160
[Thud]

16:21.760 --> 16:22.840
[Thud]

16:24.240 --> 16:25.320
[Thud]

16:27.040 --> 16:28.720
[Loud
footsteps]

16:40.600 --> 16:41.320
[Thud]

16:42.760 --> 16:44.200
[Thud]

16:48.760 --> 16:50.080
My god!

16:50.080 --> 16:51.680
The dollhouse!

16:51.680 --> 16:53.520
I'm in the dollhouse.

16:58.120 --> 16:59.760
Aunt Sally?

17:02.680 --> 17:05.319
Aunt Sally, back here,
in the dollhouse!

17:08.119 --> 17:10.720
Please! No, wait!
In the dollhouse!

17:10.720 --> 17:12.720
It's no use.

17:12.720 --> 17:14.520
She can't hear you.

17:17.160 --> 17:17.839
Susan?

17:19.200 --> 17:21.480
I knew you'd come.

17:21.480 --> 17:25.319
What's wrong with you?
You look just like...

17:25.319 --> 17:27.160
A doll! But how?

17:27.160 --> 17:29.200
What's happened
to you?

17:31.960 --> 17:34.080
You've turned into
a doll!

17:34.080 --> 17:36.880
The dollhouse
did this to you?

17:36.880 --> 17:39.160
OK, look.
You sit there.

17:39.160 --> 17:41.000
I'll be right back.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.800
It's the attic.

17:44.800 --> 17:48.640
Yes. I'm going to take
you back to the attic.

17:48.640 --> 17:50.720
The attic.

17:50.720 --> 17:52.360
Yes. The attic.
Don't worry.

17:52.360 --> 17:54.440
Everything's
going to be all right.

18:03.160 --> 18:04.680
My god! The door!

18:04.680 --> 18:06.760
It was right here!

18:09.720 --> 18:11.240
My hands!

18:12.520 --> 18:15.680
There's gotta be
another way out of here.

18:15.680 --> 18:18.680
2 doors on this side.
One on the other.

18:18.680 --> 18:20.160
Stairs over there.

18:20.160 --> 18:21.960
Just like Susan's house.

18:23.640 --> 18:25.400
OK. That means
there should be

18:25.400 --> 18:27.000
a closet right here

18:27.000 --> 18:30.920
with a ladder leading
up to the--to the attic!

18:30.920 --> 18:33.280
That's what she meant!
Not the real attic--

18:33.280 --> 18:35.680
the dollhouse attic!

18:35.680 --> 18:37.760
[Grunting]

18:45.040 --> 18:46.320
The bureau, right?

18:46.320 --> 18:49.720
We've gotta move it
to get to the attic!

18:49.720 --> 18:52.000
The bureau's too big!
You've gotta help me!

18:52.000 --> 18:53.880
I can't.

18:53.880 --> 18:55.440
You have to!

18:55.440 --> 18:58.760
If we don't move that bureau,
we can't ever get out of here!

19:06.280 --> 19:07.800
I'll try again.

19:16.800 --> 19:17.920
Yes!

19:20.760 --> 19:21.800
Yes!

19:44.160 --> 19:46.960
There it is, in
exactly the same place.

19:46.960 --> 19:49.160
OK. Here we go!

19:54.720 --> 19:56.800
OK. Nice and easy.

20:02.040 --> 20:03.040
Oops.

20:07.640 --> 20:10.160
Susan? Can you
hear me?

20:10.160 --> 20:11.880
Oh, no!

20:14.240 --> 20:17.160
Don't worry.
Just a couple more seconds,

20:17.160 --> 20:19.360
and everything'll be OK.

20:28.800 --> 20:31.600
But... that's impossible.

20:31.600 --> 20:34.600
The dollhouse is in
their attic, not outside.

20:34.600 --> 20:36.720
This has to be it!

20:57.440 --> 20:59.040
Ready?

21:05.880 --> 21:07.200
OK.

21:09.840 --> 21:10.840
Here goes nothing!

21:18.200 --> 21:19.640
It's my fault.

21:19.640 --> 21:21.560
No, it's not
your fault.

21:21.560 --> 21:23.080
Don't go
overreacting.

21:23.080 --> 21:26.080
I'm sure she'll turn
up safe and sound.

21:26.080 --> 21:28.080
It's the same as Susan.

21:28.080 --> 21:29.560
Exactly the same.

21:29.560 --> 21:33.080
Maybe it was someone else
who broke into the house.

21:33.080 --> 21:34.560
For all we know,

21:34.560 --> 21:37.640
Melissa could be out
going for a walk.

21:40.640 --> 21:41.680
Oh, Peter.

21:43.640 --> 21:44.800
Look!

21:47.560 --> 21:49.760
Aunt Sally!

21:49.760 --> 21:50.760
Aunt Sally!

21:50.760 --> 21:53.080
Uncle Pete!

21:53.080 --> 21:54.360
Melissa!

21:55.520 --> 21:56.560
Oh!

21:59.160 --> 22:01.600
I was so worried
you'd disappeared...

22:01.600 --> 22:03.080
Just like Susan.

22:03.080 --> 22:04.600
But I did!

22:04.600 --> 22:06.080
What do you mean,
sweetheart?

22:06.080 --> 22:09.080
I disappeared just like
Susan, and I found her!

22:09.080 --> 22:10.920
What are you saying?

22:10.920 --> 22:12.120
Look!

22:28.840 --> 22:30.280
Come on.

22:31.600 --> 22:33.040
That very night,

22:33.040 --> 22:35.040
Melissa's uncle
burned the dollhouse

22:35.040 --> 22:38.040
in a big bonfire
in the backyard.

22:38.040 --> 22:40.040
As it went up in flames,

22:40.040 --> 22:41.520
Melissa wondered

22:41.520 --> 22:45.080
where the door in the
Hendersons' attic would lead

22:45.080 --> 22:47.440
now that there was
no dollhouse left.

22:47.440 --> 22:49.520
The end.

22:49.520 --> 22:51.040
Yeah...

22:51.040 --> 22:53.320
Where would it
lead to?

22:53.320 --> 22:55.240
Oh? You awake?

22:56.360 --> 22:59.520
Yeah, yeah. Not bad
for a doll story.

23:01.600 --> 23:05.560
I declare this meeting of
the Midnight Society closed.

23:05.560 --> 23:07.400
Good night, everybody.

23:13.400 --> 23:16.960
Yo, bet,
you forgot your doll.

23:18.320 --> 23:20.800
This thing
looks just like...

23:20.800 --> 23:21.840
You!

23:23.040 --> 23:25.240
Where'd she get that?

23:27.080 --> 23:30.240
That's a whole
other story.
