10:14.380 --> 10:16.170
Slimy dude.

10:16.170 --> 10:17.500
You in here?

10:26.710 --> 10:29.790
What do you think
this place was anyway?

10:29.790 --> 10:31.710
I don't know.

10:31.710 --> 10:34.750
These stairs
are not easy
in this dress.

10:34.750 --> 10:37.290
Whoa, check it out.

10:37.290 --> 10:40.330
It's like
a little campsite.

10:44.880 --> 10:47.080
These earmarks are fresh.

10:48.580 --> 10:50.420
[both gasp]

10:50.420 --> 10:52.580
Slime?
If that was you,

10:52.580 --> 10:54.750
now would be
a nice time to tell us.

10:54.750 --> 10:56.670
[Marco] Matches,
matches, matches!

10:56.670 --> 10:58.790
Okay, here.
I've got the candle.

10:58.790 --> 11:00.620
- Here, here.
- I can't see where.

11:00.620 --> 11:01.790
Wait, I'll just
use my wand.

11:06.670 --> 11:07.540
What the...

11:07.540 --> 11:10.580
Mina Loveberry?

11:10.580 --> 11:12.460
Mud Sister?

11:14.960 --> 11:16.670
What the heck are
you doing here?

11:16.670 --> 11:18.960
I am throwing
a very important

11:18.960 --> 11:21.170
Mewman and Monster
friendship party.

11:21.170 --> 11:23.120
Wait, wait,
monsters?

11:23.120 --> 11:25.170
I've been throwing monsters
into this closet

11:25.170 --> 11:28.080
- all night.
- Get us outta here!

11:28.080 --> 11:30.750
What? Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
What are you doing?

11:30.750 --> 11:32.580
You need to let them go
right now.

11:32.580 --> 11:34.960
I need to keep
this place safe

11:34.960 --> 11:37.420
from evil monster
treachery.

11:37.420 --> 11:39.460
They're not evil,
they're my friends.

11:39.460 --> 11:41.920
Come on.
This place is abandoned.

11:41.920 --> 11:43.790
Nothing sinister
is going on.

11:43.790 --> 11:45.880
Young warrior, everything
about these monsters

11:45.880 --> 11:47.790
and whoz-its is sinister.

11:47.790 --> 11:49.710
You don't understand.
I am trying to--

11:49.710 --> 11:51.540
Interrupting!

11:51.540 --> 11:53.170
You don't understand
the complexities

11:53.170 --> 11:54.960
of this situation.

11:54.960 --> 11:56.750
I am duty-bound
to protect this temple.

11:56.750 --> 11:58.670
Doctor's orders.

11:58.670 --> 12:00.920
This one's
all you, Mud Sister.

12:00.920 --> 12:03.710
Maybe it's time
to get a second opinion.

12:03.710 --> 12:05.920
You doubt the words
of a professional?

12:05.920 --> 12:08.420
No, but, just... ow!

12:08.420 --> 12:10.040
Okay, stop it!

12:10.040 --> 12:11.790
Okay, Mina, look,
let's just calm down

12:11.790 --> 12:13.790
and not escalate things.

12:13.790 --> 12:16.620
I'm not the one
escalating things, escalator.

12:16.620 --> 12:18.540
I've been waiting
hundreds of years... aaah!

12:22.620 --> 12:25.540
Princess Marco.

12:25.540 --> 12:28.210
Heinous?!
Oh, no!

12:28.210 --> 12:30.580
I am done
running from you.

12:30.580 --> 12:33.000
This ends now...

12:35.540 --> 12:37.120
Okay.

12:37.120 --> 12:40.330
Now to set the mood.
Play the music.

12:40.330 --> 12:42.620
Again, milady?

12:42.620 --> 12:44.000
Play it!!

12:44.000 --> 12:45.620
Yes, ma'am.

12:45.620 --> 12:47.710
[whispering]
Heard it 15 times.

12:47.710 --> 12:51.170
[thrash rock playing]

12:55.880 --> 12:57.790
Start the machine.

12:57.790 --> 13:00.080
[muttering]

13:00.080 --> 13:04.000
Milady, the lever is stuck.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.620
What? Hmm?

13:05.620 --> 13:09.040
When I push it,
it doesn't go down.

13:09.040 --> 13:10.420
You imbecile!

13:10.420 --> 13:12.420
Utterly incompetent.

13:12.420 --> 13:14.170
But no matter.

13:14.170 --> 13:18.580
This is between me
and Princess Marco now.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.540
Milady.

13:44.710 --> 13:46.250
[gasps]

13:50.000 --> 13:52.380
It can't be.

13:55.790 --> 13:58.170
So are we still
fighting or... ?

13:58.170 --> 13:59.540
Leave the room, Marco.

14:01.620 --> 14:04.540
What have you
got there, milady?

14:06.540 --> 14:07.920
Dolls.

14:07.920 --> 14:11.120
Oh, I...
I can see that.

14:11.120 --> 14:13.000
These were my dolls.

14:13.000 --> 14:16.380
I love my dolls.

14:16.380 --> 14:18.670
That's...
that's very...

14:18.670 --> 14:19.830
nice.

14:19.830 --> 14:21.830
I can't believe it.

14:21.830 --> 14:24.000
It's all
coming back to me.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.380
That was my bookshelf,

14:26.380 --> 14:28.460
and my toy chest.

14:28.460 --> 14:32.000
This place,
this was my nursery.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.170
[gasps]

14:36.540 --> 14:40.170
And this...
this was my baby bed.

14:40.170 --> 14:43.380
But how is
this possible?

14:43.380 --> 14:45.500
Oh, it's possible,
all right.

14:45.500 --> 14:47.540
I knew you'd
be back here one day...

14:47.540 --> 14:49.500
Meteora.

14:49.500 --> 14:52.120
I beg your pardon!

14:52.120 --> 14:54.080
This is Miss Heinous,

14:54.080 --> 14:56.290
the honorable
headmistress

14:56.290 --> 14:59.790
of St. Olga's School
for Wayward Princesses.

14:59.790 --> 15:02.710
No. Meteora.

15:02.710 --> 15:04.960
That is my name.

15:04.960 --> 15:09.420
At least, it was my name
a long, long time ago.

15:09.420 --> 15:13.170
Milady, your arm.

15:13.170 --> 15:15.210
No, no, no, no, no!

15:15.210 --> 15:18.000
Shall I fetch your makeup?

15:18.000 --> 15:19.830
Well, ain't this
a pretty picture?

15:19.830 --> 15:21.750
First, Eclipsa wakes up,

15:21.750 --> 15:24.830
and now, look who
comes a-cryin'. Typical.

15:24.830 --> 15:27.000
Whoa, wait. Eclipsa?
What does she have to do
with this?

15:27.000 --> 15:28.960
Yeah, can someone
fill us in?

15:28.960 --> 15:31.120
Don't you ding-dongs
know anything?

15:31.120 --> 15:33.170
She's her mama.

15:33.170 --> 15:35.750
Eclipsa is
Heinous' mother?!

15:35.750 --> 15:37.710
But how? Eclipsa's
hundreds of years old.

15:37.710 --> 15:40.170
Besides, that would mean
Heinous is a...

15:40.170 --> 15:41.620
a princess.

15:41.620 --> 15:44.380
It means
she's a Butterfly.

15:44.380 --> 15:46.580
It means
she's a monster.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.580
Now, uh, see here...

15:52.580 --> 15:53.620
[shrieks]

15:53.620 --> 15:55.920
Whoa, whoa, Mina.

15:55.920 --> 15:57.710
Wait just one second.

15:57.710 --> 15:59.420
I got a lot
of questions here.

15:59.420 --> 16:01.330
Doctor's orders!

16:01.330 --> 16:02.750
Double rainbow fist!

16:04.580 --> 16:06.500
- Quick, go get
the monster kids.
- Right.

16:09.620 --> 16:11.670
Stardust daisy devastation!

16:23.000 --> 16:25.290
Whoa! Get out!

16:25.290 --> 16:27.460
Oh, you let them go?!

16:27.460 --> 16:28.750
You traitor!

16:32.670 --> 16:34.460
Miss Heinous.

16:34.460 --> 16:36.500
We must leave quickly.

16:41.670 --> 16:44.040
Star? Star, are you
down here?

16:44.040 --> 16:45.670
[Star screams]

16:46.710 --> 16:48.080
- Tom!
- Star!

16:48.080 --> 16:50.000
Look, I know
I did something wrong,

16:50.000 --> 16:51.540
and I'm still
not sure what,

16:51.540 --> 16:53.960
but I want to apologize.

16:53.960 --> 16:55.710
That's great, great.

16:55.710 --> 16:57.500
Kind of got
a thing here.

17:01.380 --> 17:03.420
Spider with a top hat blast!

17:09.710 --> 17:10.710
War!

17:26.290 --> 17:28.080
[growling]

17:28.080 --> 17:29.670
[magical chanting]

17:37.620 --> 17:39.670
[pounding]

17:41.000 --> 17:43.170
Ooh. Ah!

17:45.040 --> 17:46.880
Where is she?

17:46.880 --> 17:49.960
Where is Meteora now?

17:49.960 --> 17:51.960
[screeching]

17:53.420 --> 17:54.830
[laughing]

17:54.830 --> 17:57.170
Okay, all right,
here's another one, okay?

17:57.170 --> 17:59.960
- Knock, knock.
- [all] Who's there?

18:02.790 --> 18:04.420
Where is Meteora?

18:04.420 --> 18:06.290
Where's the monster?

18:06.290 --> 18:07.830
Raspberry ribbon rainbow!

18:10.000 --> 18:12.620
You're ruining everything
I'm trying to accomplish.

18:12.620 --> 18:15.540
Well, you just helped
the most dangerous monster

18:15.540 --> 18:17.790
in the history
of Mewni escape.

18:21.250 --> 18:23.790
What's happening?!

18:25.500 --> 18:27.790
- Everybody freeze!
- Oh, no.

18:27.790 --> 18:30.620
The donut patrol?
I gotta make tracks.

18:36.250 --> 18:39.540
So... you guys
came here to party?

18:43.620 --> 18:45.670
[siren blaring]

18:46.670 --> 18:49.620
You are in a world
of trouble, young lady.

18:49.620 --> 18:52.420
Look, it was just
a party, okay?

18:52.420 --> 18:54.210
We weren't doing
anything wrong.

18:54.210 --> 18:55.750
Oh, really?

18:55.750 --> 18:57.960
Then what was
that huge surge of magic

18:57.960 --> 19:00.000
we detected in
the dungeon earlier?

19:00.000 --> 19:02.580
Oh, yeah. That.

19:02.580 --> 19:05.620
Do you have any idea
what this place is?

19:05.620 --> 19:08.620
Uh, a fun place
to throw parties?

19:08.620 --> 19:11.330
It's not just
a fun place to throw parties.

19:11.330 --> 19:15.250
It's, well, I'm not even
authorized to tell you
what it is.

19:15.250 --> 19:17.420
That's how bad it is.

19:17.420 --> 19:19.540
[blows raspberry]

19:19.540 --> 19:20.920
You don't know
what it is, do you?

19:20.920 --> 19:23.880
What? No, I totally
know what it is.

19:23.880 --> 19:26.250
- It's...
- [gibbering]

19:26.250 --> 19:28.420
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

19:28.420 --> 19:29.880
I don't have
time for this.

19:29.880 --> 19:32.710
You stay here.
I got a crime scene
to deal with.

19:35.380 --> 19:37.250
Hey.

19:37.250 --> 19:39.120
I made this for you.

19:39.120 --> 19:40.960
I mean, no,
that's a lie.

19:40.960 --> 19:42.170
They're just handing
'em out over there.

19:42.170 --> 19:43.960
I was, um... here.

19:43.960 --> 19:46.000
Aw, thanks, Tom.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.080
So, sorry for being
a total nag back there.

19:49.080 --> 19:50.790
I get it now.

19:50.790 --> 19:52.670
You were dealing with
some serious stuff.

19:52.670 --> 19:55.210
It's okay. Doesn't even
matter now anyway.

19:55.210 --> 19:56.670
The party was
a disaster.

19:56.670 --> 19:59.500
What? No!
It was a great party.

19:59.500 --> 20:02.170
I mean, sure, some
monsters got trapped
in a closet,

20:02.170 --> 20:04.620
and Mina probably
traumatized some people,

20:04.620 --> 20:06.330
and we got busted
by the cops,

20:06.330 --> 20:08.250
and I am not
helping at all right now.

20:08.250 --> 20:10.170
This is all my fault.

20:10.170 --> 20:12.580
I really thought I could
just change everything
overnight.

20:12.580 --> 20:14.380
Ugh, I was so wrong.

20:14.380 --> 20:16.250
Hey, don't be
so hard on yourself.

20:16.250 --> 20:17.750
There's no way
you could've known

20:17.750 --> 20:19.120
all this weirdness
would happen.

20:19.120 --> 20:21.380
Yeah, that's
the problem, Tom.

20:21.380 --> 20:23.080
I don't know anything.

20:23.080 --> 20:25.210
I don't know how to fix
what's wrong with Mewni,

20:25.210 --> 20:27.290
I don't even know
who my own family
is anymore.

20:27.290 --> 20:29.710
All that stuff with
Heinous and Eclipsa.

20:29.710 --> 20:31.580
I just...

20:31.580 --> 20:33.750
Hey, hey, hey!
What do you think
you're doing?

20:33.750 --> 20:35.250
Let those monsters go.

20:35.250 --> 20:37.040
We found these hooligans
loitering outside the temple.

20:37.040 --> 20:38.620
I need to take them in
for processing.

20:38.620 --> 20:40.500
Oh, really?

20:40.500 --> 20:42.620
Then why don't you process
those hooligans?

20:42.620 --> 20:45.210
- More hot chocolate,
Your Highness?
- Yes.

20:45.210 --> 20:47.120
Well, uh...

20:47.120 --> 20:48.540
- Let 'em go!
- Yes, Your Highness.

20:50.620 --> 20:53.000
I am so sorry
this happened to
you guys.

20:53.000 --> 20:55.170
It's okay, Star.

20:55.170 --> 20:57.920
Trust me, this happens
to us all the time.

20:57.920 --> 20:59.620
I can make it up to you.

20:59.620 --> 21:02.080
Stay for the after-party.
Snacks on me.

21:02.080 --> 21:05.750
Uh, thanks, but I've
had enough parties for a while.

21:05.750 --> 21:08.120
Yeah, I almost
died for real.

21:08.120 --> 21:10.580
Catch you later, okay?

21:13.290 --> 21:16.500
[sirens wailing]

21:19.580 --> 21:22.420
There's too much
heat out there.

21:22.420 --> 21:25.420
We should get
going, Miss Heinous.

21:25.420 --> 21:28.620
That's not my name.

21:28.620 --> 21:30.710
I'm... sorry.
