out about you that

19:07.762 --> 19:10.064
you didn't know yourself
or didn't wanna say.

19:10.097 --> 19:11.733
We could tell you
things like,

19:11.765 --> 19:14.167
"Which of these two paintings
will you prefer?"

19:14.201 --> 19:15.637
- Mm-hmm.
- How do you really

19:15.669 --> 19:17.638
feel about someone,
or imagine

19:17.671 --> 19:19.273
using this for dating.

19:19.307 --> 19:21.776
Because it's reading
your subconscious mind...

19:21.809 --> 19:23.711
- Mm-hmm.
- We might be able to tell that

19:23.744 --> 19:27.282
you prefer someone
that you don't actually

19:27.314 --> 19:29.016
think you do.

19:29.050 --> 19:32.052
Well, that sounds scary.

19:32.086 --> 19:33.154
[laughter]

19:33.186 --> 19:35.089
But... but at the same time,

19:35.121 --> 19:37.292
I feel like I...
I don't know.

19:37.324 --> 19:39.561
I'm such a human, Michael,
I feel like

19:39.593 --> 19:41.061
my humans response is like,
"Okay,

19:41.094 --> 19:43.030
"there's a process
my brain goes through.

19:43.063 --> 19:44.698
"I get it. You learned it.

19:44.732 --> 19:48.670
But it's still my brain,
it's still my process".

19:48.703 --> 19:51.773
- Denial.
- Is...

19:57.344 --> 20:00.881
I... I like to call it
"Limitations" of free will.

20:00.915 --> 20:02.358
And by the way, we know that
you're gonna have

20:02.382 --> 20:03.984
chicken salad
for tomorrow's dinner.

20:04.017 --> 20:05.362
[laughter]
Yes, that's very clear.

20:05.386 --> 20:06.888
It's very good
at predicting that.

20:06.920 --> 20:08.789
- Yeah.

Or is it?
[sighs]

20:42.389 --> 20:45.792
Moran's box kind of questions
some of that.

20:45.826 --> 20:50.031
If your brain can tell us
what you're going to do

20:50.063 --> 20:52.766
before you even know
you're going to do it,

20:52.800 --> 20:55.203
is your conscious mind
actually being controlled

20:55.235 --> 20:56.937

Do you truly have free will?

Or are you just...

21:07.313 --> 21:10.118
like a puppet?

21:10.150 --> 21:13.086
A puppet who thinks

21:13.119 --> 21:15.657
it has no strings?

21:15.689 --> 21:17.725
Does your conscious, aware self

21:19.827 --> 21:22.330

[laughs] Well, more research

But what we do know is that

21:28.436 --> 21:32.939
things you normally wouldn't
consider part of you

21:32.973 --> 21:36.377
are a gigantic part of you.
