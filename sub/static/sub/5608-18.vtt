WEBVTT

00:05.276 --> 00:06.950
ERIN:
Okay, this is it.

00:06.951 --> 00:08.951
KATHY (over phone):
We're broadcasting on WQTI,

00:08.953 --> 00:11.888
streaming on WQTI.org.

00:11.890 --> 00:15.191
The name of our live podcast
is <i>Justice Denied.</i>

00:15.193 --> 00:17.293
Our guest is Jeffrey Durning,

00:17.295 --> 00:19.529
distinguished heart surgeon,
philanthropist,

00:19.531 --> 00:22.698
and defendant in one of the most
sensational murder trials

00:22.700 --> 00:23.800
of the decade.

00:23.802 --> 00:25.068
Jeffrey, thanks
for joining us.

00:25.070 --> 00:26.736
JEFFREY: Thank you
for having me on, Kathy.

00:26.738 --> 00:28.304
Oh, please,
give me a break.

00:28.306 --> 00:30.506
You know they can't
hear you, right?

00:31.576 --> 00:33.443
KATHY: I must admit,
I feel a little strange

00:33.445 --> 00:35.044
talking to you.

00:35.046 --> 00:37.880
The last time we saw each other
was a year ago in the courtroom

00:37.882 --> 00:40.316
when I was prosecuting you
for killing your wife Beth.

00:40.318 --> 00:42.151
JEFFREY: I'm glad you had
the courage to re-examine

00:42.153 --> 00:44.153
the evidence and come to
a more honest conclusion,

00:44.155 --> 00:45.555
which is more than I can say

00:45.557 --> 00:46.689
for some of your
former colleagues.

00:46.691 --> 00:47.924
Yeah, well,
if he's so honest,

00:47.926 --> 00:49.525
how come you're
hiding from us,

00:49.527 --> 00:52.895
and telling your story on the
air instead of in a courtroom?

00:52.897 --> 00:54.664
The first trial ended
in a hung jury,

00:54.666 --> 00:56.165
so tell me, why do you think

00:56.167 --> 00:58.534
the Manhattan D.A.'s office
is coming after you again?

00:58.536 --> 01:00.069
Maybe because
you killed your wife

01:00.071 --> 01:03.005
and you dumped her body
from a plane over the Atlantic?

01:03.007 --> 01:04.574
JEFFREY: Obviously,
the office has had a series

01:04.575 --> 01:06.576
of high-profile disasters.

01:06.578 --> 01:07.877
They're looking for
a rich, white man's scalp

01:07.879 --> 01:08.945
to make up for them.

01:08.947 --> 01:10.913
Of course, now we have
my old friend

01:10.915 --> 01:13.149
Erin Reagan saying
she has new evidence,

01:13.151 --> 01:14.884
but like your wife's body,
no one has seen it.

01:14.886 --> 01:17.320
Police!
Come on, out of the way.

01:17.322 --> 01:18.988
Move! Get out of the way.

01:18.990 --> 01:20.356
Oh, it looks like

01:20.358 --> 01:21.958
we have some surprise
guests joining us.

01:21.960 --> 01:23.726
We're gonna take a break.

01:24.796 --> 01:26.963
(taps on glass)

01:28.099 --> 01:29.565
Where is he?

01:29.567 --> 01:32.602
Obviously not
on the premises.

01:37.976 --> 01:40.910
(car alarm blaring)

01:40.912 --> 01:43.012
Oh, my God,
I hate these things!

01:43.014 --> 01:45.748
Aren't they supposed to shut off
after three minutes?

01:45.750 --> 01:47.550
It's an older model; I guess
the guy didn't get the message

01:47.552 --> 01:48.784
he needed to get it fixed.

01:48.786 --> 01:51.187
Or that he needs to move
the car for street cleaning.

01:51.189 --> 01:52.622
How long has it been here?

01:52.624 --> 01:54.557
A couple days at least, right?

01:54.559 --> 01:55.558
Excuse me, ma'am!

01:55.560 --> 01:57.360
(car alarm continues blaring)

01:57.362 --> 01:59.162
You know whose car this is?

01:59.164 --> 02:00.830
Hey, handsome.

02:00.832 --> 02:02.265
What's it worth
to you?

02:02.267 --> 02:04.534
(chuckles)
Well...

02:04.536 --> 02:07.403
My tenant,
Harry Clark.

02:07.405 --> 02:09.939
I keep telling him
he needs a new car.

02:09.941 --> 02:12.275
I know he can afford it.

02:12.277 --> 02:14.110
Would you have
him come down?

02:14.112 --> 02:16.712
I would, if I'd seen him lately.

02:18.883 --> 02:22.118
Ma'am, do you notice that
smell inside your apartment?

02:22.120 --> 02:24.220
No.

02:24.222 --> 02:26.088
But my nose stopped working
years ago.

02:26.090 --> 02:27.924
Too much fun
in the '70s.

02:27.926 --> 02:29.225
You know what I'm saying.

02:29.227 --> 02:30.726
Come we come take a look?

02:30.728 --> 02:33.629
Sure. Come on in.

02:39.070 --> 02:40.503
Ugh.

02:40.505 --> 02:42.738
Ma'am, can you please
wait outside?

02:44.742 --> 02:46.642
(gags)

02:46.644 --> 02:48.211
(coughs)

02:55.086 --> 02:57.587
(groans)
Eddie, he's in here.

02:57.589 --> 02:59.555
Oh, he's ripe.

02:59.557 --> 03:01.357
(groans)

03:01.359 --> 03:02.925
(coughs)

03:05.029 --> 03:06.095
(groans)

03:06.097 --> 03:07.930
It's been a few days, huh?

03:07.932 --> 03:10.099
Oh.

03:10.101 --> 03:11.300
Poor Harry.

03:11.302 --> 03:13.502
Ma'am, I asked you to wait outside.
Aw.

03:13.504 --> 03:14.770
Is this Harry Clark, ma'am?

03:14.772 --> 03:16.472
Yeah.

03:16.474 --> 03:18.608
Although, come to think of it,

03:18.610 --> 03:20.543
I'm not sure
that's his <i>real</i> name.

03:20.545 --> 03:22.612
What do you mean?

03:22.614 --> 03:24.547
I never saw a bank check
with his name on it.

03:24.549 --> 03:26.415
Always paid the
rent in cash.

03:26.417 --> 03:29.118
And some of his mail came
with different names on it.

03:29.120 --> 03:31.354
Do you have a next of kin
we can contact?

03:31.356 --> 03:33.522
No. No one ever
visited him.

03:33.524 --> 03:36.759
Uh, Eddie, see if you can
find some Vicks.

03:36.761 --> 03:38.327
The smell's starting
to get to me.

03:38.329 --> 03:40.062
I may have some.
Thank you, ma'am.

03:40.064 --> 03:41.397
We're all set, thank you.
Oh.

03:41.399 --> 03:43.799
Well, if you need me
for anything, just call me.

03:43.801 --> 03:45.801
And, you, just call me.

03:45.803 --> 03:46.969
Okay.

03:48.573 --> 03:51.207

Good to see you, Nick.
You're looking well.

04:10.895 --> 04:13.195
Thank you. You, too.

04:13.197 --> 04:14.363
Thanks for this.

04:14.365 --> 04:15.564
Yeah.

04:15.566 --> 04:16.666
How's the family?

04:16.668 --> 04:17.966
Good.

04:17.969 --> 04:20.403
Yours?
Grown up and out.

04:20.404 --> 04:23.606
Your son, kind of a hothead,
whatever happened to him?

04:23.608 --> 04:25.808
Detective, first grade.
Oh.

04:25.810 --> 04:28.044
And the other one,
going to Harvard?

04:28.046 --> 04:29.412
On the job as well,

04:29.414 --> 04:32.048
and my daughter Erin
works for the D.A.'s office.

04:32.050 --> 04:35.284
It's nice having
a family business, huh?

04:36.120 --> 04:38.521
It is.

04:38.523 --> 04:41.991
You know, Frank, when I heard
that you got your father's job,

04:41.993 --> 04:44.260
I was happy
to hear that.

04:44.262 --> 04:45.995
They gave it to the right man.

04:45.997 --> 04:48.898
Thank you.

04:48.900 --> 04:50.199
Tyrell Dawes,
come on in.

04:55.340 --> 04:57.807
Sit down.

05:12.190 --> 05:13.989
You know why you're here?

05:13.991 --> 05:16.092
My parole officer said
I should come by here,

05:16.094 --> 05:18.094
but I didn't have to by law.

05:18.096 --> 05:19.995
This is your Offender
Notification Forum.

05:19.997 --> 05:22.598
We hold them for people
who just got out of prison

05:22.600 --> 05:24.333
with a high risk
of going back.

05:24.335 --> 05:26.135
Come on, man, what do
you got, a crystal ball?

05:26.137 --> 05:28.037
You're a gang member
who just did three and a half

05:28.039 --> 05:29.572
for committing a robbery
with a handgun

05:29.574 --> 05:31.707
in New York City.

05:36.481 --> 05:37.713
(scoffs) Come on, man.

05:37.715 --> 05:40.549
What do you got, an extra
eight-by-ten for my moms?

05:40.551 --> 05:42.418
Turn it over.

05:44.956 --> 05:48.491
What's "15" mean?

05:48.493 --> 05:51.093
if you commit another crime
with a gun.

05:51.095 --> 05:52.361
And that's a hard number;

05:52.363 --> 05:54.964
there won't be
any pleading it down.

05:54.966 --> 05:57.566
It's up to you, Tyrell.

05:57.568 --> 05:59.502
None of y'all know me.

05:59.504 --> 06:01.771
None of y'al know where
I've been or where I'm going.

06:01.773 --> 06:03.005
Yeah, we do.

06:03.007 --> 06:05.341
You want to tell him
or should I?

06:05.343 --> 06:07.309
May I?

06:09.280 --> 06:11.514
I am here for
the same reason that you are,

06:11.516 --> 06:13.449
because the commissioner 
asked me to be here,

06:13.451 --> 06:17.420
and because I just finished
a 20-year bid of my own

06:17.422 --> 06:19.121
in the state prison.

06:19.123 --> 06:21.023
I could still be in that prison.

06:22.059 --> 06:24.660
I killed someone
who threatened my family.

06:24.662 --> 06:26.395
Commissioner Reagan,
who at that time

06:26.397 --> 06:28.063
was Detective Reagan,

06:28.065 --> 06:30.099
could've buried me.

06:30.101 --> 06:32.101
But he didn't.

06:32.103 --> 06:36.539
He gave me a fair shake.
So I listened to him.

06:42.680 --> 06:44.380
Man, is this real?

06:44.382 --> 06:46.582
Every word.

06:51.489 --> 06:54.123
(sighs)

06:54.125 --> 06:56.325
(exhales)

07:06.504 --> 07:08.671
(panting)

07:08.673 --> 07:10.272
Look at this.

07:12.176 --> 07:16.645
They're all $100 bills. There's gotta 
be ten of thousand of dollars in here.

07:16.647 --> 07:18.647
Eddie, I wouldn't be
touching that.

07:20.751 --> 07:22.785
"Dear Sandi, I am so sorry
about everything.

07:22.787 --> 07:25.287
Maybe the rest of this money
will help."

07:25.289 --> 07:27.423
What's he got
to be sorry for?

07:27.425 --> 07:29.625
Yeah, and who was he?

DANNY: What do we got?

08:04.600 --> 08:07.200
Four wounded.
One serious and likely to die.

08:07.202 --> 08:08.835
Shootout inside the diner.

08:08.837 --> 08:11.104
One of the rounds went
through the front window.

08:11.106 --> 08:13.974
The likely is
an Alex Kalamogdartis.

08:13.976 --> 08:15.041
Kala-what?

08:15.043 --> 08:16.176
I don't know,
it's Greek.

08:16.178 --> 08:17.777
Okay, what about
the other three vics?

08:17.779 --> 08:19.079
Two of them
were other customers,

08:19.081 --> 08:22.048
and the third was a 12-year-old
boy walking by outside

08:22.050 --> 08:23.350
with his family.

08:23.352 --> 08:24.684
Don't ask me
to pronounce his name.

08:24.686 --> 08:27.687
Okay, so we got a gang war at
a greasy spoon. Any witnesses?

08:27.689 --> 08:29.723
Well, no one's talking about
why it jumped off tonight.

08:29.725 --> 08:31.825
We do know this Alex
may have had a dispute

08:31.827 --> 08:32.792
with the management.

08:32.794 --> 08:34.527
Any actual witnesses
to the shooting?

08:34.529 --> 08:35.962
Not so much.
Hey, boss.

08:35.964 --> 08:37.864
Everyone's saying how it was
too dark to see anything.

08:37.866 --> 08:39.399
Too dark in a
brightly lit diner?

08:39.400 --> 08:40.900
Well, they've been
renting it out

08:40.902 --> 08:42.469
as pop-up nightclub
sometimes.

08:42.471 --> 08:43.870
The current owner
is over there,

08:43.871 --> 08:46.172
Stavros Constantine.

08:46.174 --> 08:48.208
Hey, Stavros.

08:48.210 --> 08:51.344
Hey! Want to tell us
what this is about?

08:51.346 --> 08:53.146
I mean, I have no idea.

08:53.148 --> 08:55.815
We've never had any trouble
on club nights before.

08:55.817 --> 08:58.785
Oh, well, can't imagine
people shooting your place up

08:58.787 --> 09:00.920
if all you're doing
is serving moussaka.

09:00.922 --> 09:02.288
Listen, I'm as confused
as you are, okay?

09:02.290 --> 09:03.590
One minute, I'm in the back

09:03.592 --> 09:05.558
making sure we got enough
champagne for bottle service,

09:05.560 --> 09:06.926
and the next,

09:06.928 --> 09:08.995
bang, bang, bang, it's all hell
is breaking loose.

09:08.997 --> 09:10.497
So you're trying
to tell us

09:10.499 --> 09:12.132
you don't know anything
about this Alex Kala-what?

09:12.134 --> 09:13.466
...mogdartis.

09:13.468 --> 09:15.135
Kalamogdartis.
Yeah, yeah, of course.

09:15.137 --> 09:17.203
Of course I know
Alex Kalamogdartis.

09:17.205 --> 09:19.205
It's like the Trojan War
with our families.

09:19.207 --> 09:20.440
What's that mean?

09:20.442 --> 09:21.808
He's been trying
to take over our diner.

09:21.810 --> 09:23.043
Mm-hmm.
But he's been doing that

09:23.045 --> 09:25.879
to a lot of local businesses;
he's a thug.

09:25.881 --> 09:27.280
And you have no idea
who shot him.

09:27.282 --> 09:28.982
I'm afraid I-I can't help you.

09:28.984 --> 09:30.483
Can't or won't?

09:30.485 --> 09:31.685
Okay, well,
we're gonna assume

09:31.687 --> 09:33.286
that you don't have
a cabaret license

09:33.288 --> 09:34.621
for this little nightclub
of yours,

09:34.623 --> 09:35.822
so here's what we're gonna do.

09:35.824 --> 09:37.357
You're gonna get your hands
out of your pocket,

09:37.359 --> 09:38.925
and then you're gonna
take a ride with us.

09:38.927 --> 09:41.161
See if that jogs
your memory. Come on.

09:47.102 --> 09:48.768
(groans) So what?

09:48.770 --> 09:50.503
Now that the supervisors
have been and gone,

09:50.505 --> 09:52.238
we just have to sit here,

09:52.240 --> 09:54.574
safeguard the place until
the public administrator

09:54.576 --> 09:58.645
comes and starts to try to make
inventory of all this?

09:59.448 --> 10:00.947
Real-life police work, Eddie.

10:00.949 --> 10:03.049
It's not all
paperwork and donuts.

10:03.051 --> 10:05.185
(chuckles)

10:05.187 --> 10:07.954
You know, we turned over
a lot of money yesterday,

10:07.956 --> 10:09.856
and there's still
no next of kin.

10:09.858 --> 10:12.525
Some of this junk lying around
might be worth something.

10:12.527 --> 10:14.961
Bosses just want us
to keep an eye on it

10:14.963 --> 10:17.430
till things get settled.

10:17.432 --> 10:20.734
Yeah, well, hey, can we
open a window, please?

10:20.736 --> 10:22.469
The guy's gone,
but that stink is

10:22.471 --> 10:24.637
very much still here.

10:28.710 --> 10:31.044
You know,

10:31.046 --> 10:33.446
Harry must have been
hiding from something.

10:33.448 --> 10:36.182
Or someone.

10:36.184 --> 10:38.618
Sounds like he's been
locked up in this apartment

10:38.620 --> 10:40.053
the last 25 years.

10:43.525 --> 10:45.091
Hey, Jamie,
do you remember

10:45.093 --> 10:47.961
the New York
Benefactors' Trust robbery?

10:47.963 --> 10:50.630
1992, $21 million stolen.

10:50.632 --> 10:52.298
Yeah, biggest heist
in the city's history.

10:52.300 --> 10:54.501
Most of it never recovered.

10:56.605 --> 11:00.106
Keep finding all these clippings
that Harry kept about it.

11:02.911 --> 11:05.311
Jamie, you don't think...

11:05.313 --> 11:06.980
(sighs)

11:22.898 --> 11:25.632
Should we order first
or argue first?

11:25.634 --> 11:27.634
I'm happy to get
business out of the way.

11:27.636 --> 11:29.769
We have an arrest warrant
for Jeffrey Durning,

11:29.771 --> 11:31.504
and I want to know
where he is.

11:31.506 --> 11:33.239
What if I told you I don't know?

11:33.241 --> 11:34.707
Except that he's somewhere
in Europe.

11:34.709 --> 11:36.509
I wouldn't believe you.

11:36.511 --> 11:38.111
This isn't about me.

11:38.113 --> 11:39.779
It's about the facts
of the case.

11:39.781 --> 11:41.681
Right after the trial,

11:41.683 --> 11:46.619
I started hearing from witnesses
that Beth might still be alive.

11:46.621 --> 11:49.122
She was a very
unstable woman, Erin.

11:49.124 --> 11:51.024
We are going to retry this case.

11:51.026 --> 11:52.992
We just need him
back in custody.

11:52.994 --> 11:55.929
Obviously, you're worried
about losing this case

11:55.931 --> 11:58.198
in a court of public opinion
before it goes to trial.

11:58.200 --> 11:59.499
If you have new evidence,

11:59.501 --> 12:01.367
why don't you come on my show
to talk about it?

12:01.369 --> 12:03.703
How about this?

12:03.705 --> 12:06.539
I have you subpoenaed and
brought before the grand jury,

12:06.541 --> 12:08.675
and if you don't answer the
questions, I will ask the judge

12:08.677 --> 12:10.176
to hold you in contempt.

12:10.178 --> 12:11.411
You'll never win.

12:11.413 --> 12:12.579
Classic First Amendment case.

12:12.581 --> 12:15.048
But I don't have to
tell you that, do I?

12:16.184 --> 12:17.951
(sighs)

12:19.821 --> 12:21.554
Good luck, Erin.

12:21.556 --> 12:24.791
I guess I wasn't
all that hungry anyway.

12:24.793 --> 12:26.492
But maybe you are.

12:37.105 --> 12:39.339
(indistinct chatter,
phones ringing)

12:44.346 --> 12:46.880
You weren't 100% honest with us
last night, were you?

12:46.882 --> 12:49.115
What do you mean?

12:49.117 --> 12:50.116
I think you had more than

12:50.118 --> 12:52.252
breakfast, lunch and dinner
on the menu.

12:52.254 --> 12:53.486
Alex K is a known
drug dealer.

12:53.488 --> 12:54.954
He came to your place
with a beef.

12:54.956 --> 12:56.456
Now, you're trying
to tell me

12:56.458 --> 12:59.425
that if we bring the dogs in,
they're not gonna find anything?

12:59.427 --> 13:00.827
I'm no drug dealer.

13:00.829 --> 13:02.362
I run a family business.

13:02.364 --> 13:04.998
Okay, well, maybe you wouldn't
let him sell drugs in your club,

13:05.000 --> 13:06.666
and that's why he had a beef.

13:08.036 --> 13:09.969
Come on, help me
understand here.

13:09.971 --> 13:11.871
(knocking on door)

13:11.873 --> 13:13.039
(sighs)

13:15.710 --> 13:18.011
Finally got a couple
of witness statements

13:18.013 --> 13:20.914
and a photo from
a parking lot camera.

13:25.720 --> 13:28.254
(whispers):
Good work.

13:29.557 --> 13:31.524
Hmm.
What's up?

13:31.526 --> 13:34.761
You know, I'm thinking,
if you didn't fire the shots,

13:34.763 --> 13:36.930
then you definitely know
who did.

13:36.932 --> 13:38.097
Who's this?

13:41.002 --> 13:42.669
I don't know.

13:42.671 --> 13:44.003
You want to keep your business?

13:44.005 --> 13:45.171
You're gonna take another look

13:45.173 --> 13:47.106
and give me an honest answer
this time.

13:47.108 --> 13:49.108
Come on.

13:49.110 --> 13:51.277
Come on! Who is it?!

13:56.918 --> 13:59.385
It's my father.

14:04.793 --> 14:06.326
FRANK:
<i>Nick Constantine</i>

14:06.328 --> 14:08.628
is hardly a friend;
I arrested him once.

14:08.630 --> 14:09.629
Not just that.

14:09.631 --> 14:10.897
Your testimony at his trial...

14:10.899 --> 14:12.899
Was entirely truthful.

14:12.901 --> 14:14.033
And helpful to the defense.

14:14.035 --> 14:15.935
And now that
same person

14:15.937 --> 14:18.571
was present, arguably
with motive, at the scene

14:18.573 --> 14:19.906
of a shooting and
can't be found.

14:19.908 --> 14:21.040
Am I, in some way, suggesting

14:21.042 --> 14:22.642
we give him a head start?
No, boss.

14:22.644 --> 14:24.110
Then what's your point?

14:24.112 --> 14:26.579
That old media has
handed down the perception

14:26.581 --> 14:28.715
that you pulled punches
when you testified at his trial.

14:28.717 --> 14:30.917
And two days ago,
he was at your side

14:30.919 --> 14:32.785
at an
Offender's Notification Forum

14:32.787 --> 14:34.654
in the role of model ex-con.

14:34.656 --> 14:36.556
I tell you what,
you manage the perception,

14:36.558 --> 14:37.957
I'll manage my department.

14:37.959 --> 14:39.859
Less than a month ago,
you came out strong

14:39.861 --> 14:41.527
against the mayor's
Fresh Start program.

14:41.529 --> 14:42.395
This isn't that.

14:42.397 --> 14:44.797
Not your call,
all due respect.

14:44.799 --> 14:46.366
You need to distance yourself
from the appearance

14:46.368 --> 14:48.401
that you've put your eggs
in the Nick Constantine basket.

14:48.403 --> 14:50.903
A man does a wrong thing
once in his life,

14:50.905 --> 14:52.638
in this case,
for the right reason.

14:52.640 --> 14:53.873
There is a part of me

14:53.875 --> 14:56.943
that believes that there can,
in fact, be a chance

14:56.945 --> 14:59.145
for a second act
in people's lives.

15:00.815 --> 15:02.281
Any idea where he's headed?

15:02.283 --> 15:04.884
We're tracking friends,
cell records and credit cards,

15:04.886 --> 15:06.419
but after 20 years,

15:06.421 --> 15:08.521
he doesn't have that much
of a network to plug into.

15:08.523 --> 15:10.223
Which means
he can't be that far.

15:10.225 --> 15:11.290
Let's make it clear

15:11.292 --> 15:12.992
that we're devoting
all our resources

15:12.994 --> 15:15.428
to hunting him down
and making sure he pays.

15:15.430 --> 15:17.590
In other words, grandstand
before all the facts are in.

15:18.666 --> 15:20.666
Is he even the prime suspect?

15:20.668 --> 15:23.603
Well, he's more than
a person of interest.

15:23.605 --> 15:26.472
Then let's just find him.

15:34.340 --> 15:36.674
Yeah. Yeah, thanks.

15:37.874 --> 15:39.707
Public administrator's
gonna be another day.

15:39.709 --> 15:41.209
They are backed up
and understaffed.

15:41.211 --> 15:44.112
Well, Jamie,
I just found more cash.

15:44.114 --> 15:45.446
Shouldn't we tell

15:45.448 --> 15:47.015
major case
this could all be connected

15:47.017 --> 15:48.383
to that bank robbery?

15:48.385 --> 15:49.851
I already put a call in.

15:49.853 --> 15:51.419
It's no longer
an active investigation.

15:51.421 --> 15:53.154
All the robbers
are either

15:53.156 --> 15:54.656
dead or in prison,
and the bank went under

15:54.658 --> 15:55.757
in the crash of '08.

15:55.759 --> 15:58.192
We got no reason to think
that Harry was involved

15:58.194 --> 15:59.427
other than the clippings.

15:59.429 --> 16:01.062
This cash could be legitimate.

16:01.064 --> 16:02.797
Well, then where did
all the money come from?

16:02.799 --> 16:04.065
Doesn't look like
this guy's had a job

16:04.067 --> 16:05.833
in a really long time.

16:05.835 --> 16:08.736
And why all this
dog stuff and no dog?

16:08.738 --> 16:11.472
Hey, we just walked in your
apartment, what would we find?

16:11.474 --> 16:13.574
Some laundry that
needs to be folded,

16:13.576 --> 16:16.344
couple unpaid bills, maybe
something in the DVD player

16:16.346 --> 16:17.845
I'd rather nobody find out.

16:17.847 --> 16:18.846
Really?

16:18.848 --> 16:20.615
<i>The Little Mermaid.</i>

16:20.617 --> 16:21.849
Oh.

16:21.851 --> 16:23.785
Jamie, I don't know.

16:23.787 --> 16:26.220
Part of me thinks this could be
an integrity test by IAB

16:26.222 --> 16:27.789
to see what we would
actually do.

16:27.791 --> 16:29.490
Do you know how crazy
that sounds?

16:29.492 --> 16:30.458
(scoffs)

16:30.460 --> 16:32.760
(knocking on door)

16:35.532 --> 16:37.065
Can I help you?

16:37.067 --> 16:39.167
Officer Jamie Reagan?

16:39.169 --> 16:42.470
You left
a message for me.

16:42.472 --> 16:43.838
About Harry Clark.

16:43.840 --> 16:45.273
I'm Sandi Harper.

16:45.275 --> 16:47.475
This is
my grandson, David.

16:47.477 --> 16:49.544
You knew him?
He was a friend?

16:49.546 --> 16:51.512
I knew him.

16:51.514 --> 16:55.149
I wouldn't say
he was a friend exactly.

16:55.151 --> 16:57.351
He just sent me money.

17:01.057 --> 17:03.391
Mindy, I don't know
what this is.

17:03.393 --> 17:06.027
You gave us a statement
that Jeffrey told you

17:06.029 --> 17:07.161
about killing his wife,

17:07.163 --> 17:08.963
and now you're just
trying to take it back?

17:10.266 --> 17:14.102
Jeffrey came to visit me
the other night.

17:14.104 --> 17:15.636
At my apartment.

17:15.637 --> 17:17.137
He's still in town?

17:17.140 --> 17:18.606
He heard that I was helping you

17:18.608 --> 17:21.142
and telling you the things
that he said about Beth

17:21.144 --> 17:22.410
and how she disappeared.

17:22.412 --> 17:24.377
Did he say
how he heard?

17:24.380 --> 17:27.915
It sounded like he had a source
that knew people at this office.

17:30.687 --> 17:33.521
He said that
I could disappear, too.

17:33.523 --> 17:34.856
Just like Beth.

17:34.858 --> 17:36.624
He directly threatened you?

17:36.626 --> 17:39.293
He made it clear
that it wouldn't be good for me.

17:39.295 --> 17:41.028
He called me
his little shark bait.

17:41.030 --> 17:42.563
Like it was a joke.

17:42.565 --> 17:44.899
And then he left.

17:44.901 --> 17:47.702
He thinks you guys
will never find him.

17:47.704 --> 17:51.372
I understand you're scared,
but we need your testimony.

17:51.374 --> 17:53.975
Otherwise, he's gonna go out
and do this to someone else.

17:53.977 --> 17:57.044
Seriously?
Like this is my fault?

17:58.114 --> 18:00.014
I tried to tell you people
about this before,

18:00.016 --> 18:01.015
and you wouldn't believe me.

18:01.017 --> 18:03.184
You tried to tell who?

18:03.186 --> 18:06.220
The prosecutor
who had this case before you.

18:06.222 --> 18:08.222
Kathy Elliott.

18:15.698 --> 18:17.799
DANNY: Traffic camera
last spotted Nick's car

18:17.801 --> 18:19.567
at this intersection.

18:21.037 --> 18:23.337
You see anything yet?

18:23.339 --> 18:25.173
BAEZ:
This is it.

18:25.175 --> 18:26.908
This is the car
Nick was driving.

18:26.910 --> 18:28.075
Of all the places

18:28.077 --> 18:29.777
he could be hiding out,
and he chooses a diner?

18:29.779 --> 18:31.212
Well, it makes sense.

18:31.214 --> 18:32.747
He's probably hungry,
doesn't have a lot of cash.

18:32.749 --> 18:33.815
Go with what you know.

18:33.817 --> 18:35.683
Like a married guy
who divorces his wife,

18:35.685 --> 18:37.585
then marries
the same kind of girl.

18:37.587 --> 18:39.120
Shouldn't we call it in

18:39.122 --> 18:40.521
and wait for backup?
No.

18:40.523 --> 18:42.590
We're not gonna let him
run out on the check this time.

18:42.592 --> 18:43.558
(sighs)

18:43.560 --> 18:45.726
(indistinct chatter)

18:58.474 --> 19:01.075
You go that way.

19:01.878 --> 19:04.278
Excuse me.
I need you to follow me.

19:04.280 --> 19:07.281
Nick Constantine.

19:08.251 --> 19:10.585
How the hell you been?

19:11.421 --> 19:12.954
Remind me.

19:12.956 --> 19:14.255
Danny Reagan.

19:15.158 --> 19:16.657
Think you know my old man.

19:16.659 --> 19:20.261
Right, Danny.

19:20.263 --> 19:21.429
The hothead.

19:21.431 --> 19:22.630
How you doing?

19:22.632 --> 19:24.432
Maybe we should talk outside.

19:24.434 --> 19:27.201
Why would I do that?

19:27.203 --> 19:29.337
Everybody out of the diner.
Let's go.

19:30.540 --> 19:32.106
Let's go. Come on. Come on.

19:44.554 --> 19:46.320
You know, Danny,

19:46.322 --> 19:48.222
at my age...

19:50.159 --> 19:52.393
...I'm not going back to prison.

19:52.395 --> 19:55.162
We can do this the hard way
if you want.

19:55.164 --> 19:56.797
But I think
you might've caused

19:56.799 --> 19:59.267
enough pain
for your family already.

20:05.108 --> 20:09.477
If... <i>if</i> I come with you,

20:09.479 --> 20:12.813
quietly...

20:12.815 --> 20:14.649
it's on one condition.

20:14.651 --> 20:16.417
I'm listening.

20:16.419 --> 20:19.887
I talk to Frank.

20:19.889 --> 20:21.889
Nobody else.

20:21.891 --> 20:23.557
Just Frank.

20:25.428 --> 20:27.361
I'll see what I can do.

20:40.143 --> 20:42.376
What's the old man doing?

20:42.378 --> 20:44.211
Talk to him.

20:56.059 --> 20:59.226
I got word your suspect
wanted to speak to me.

20:59.228 --> 21:01.162
Yeah, he asked.

21:01.164 --> 21:02.797
And I didn't say yes.

21:02.799 --> 21:04.598
Why not?

21:04.600 --> 21:07.101
I don't typically offer up
the commissioner's time

21:07.103 --> 21:08.369
as part of my deals.

21:08.371 --> 21:11.339
I'd like to make an exception
in this instance.

21:11.341 --> 21:13.674
Well, since when
do you come down here

21:13.676 --> 21:15.242
because a suspect asked you to?

21:15.244 --> 21:18.779
Can't think of
the last time I did.

21:18.781 --> 21:21.048
Look,

21:21.050 --> 21:22.717
I know he's your collar,

21:22.719 --> 21:26.287
and you certainly don't
need my help, Detective.

21:26.289 --> 21:28.422
You're as good as I got, but...

21:30.626 --> 21:32.827
...he was my collar first.

21:35.665 --> 21:37.431
I have to know.

21:37.433 --> 21:40.001
Well, he's in the box.

21:40.003 --> 21:44.238
It might be better
if I talked to him in here.

21:45.708 --> 21:47.375
Okay.

21:47.377 --> 21:48.709
Thank you.

21:48.711 --> 21:51.045
By the way,
the gun we found on him

21:51.047 --> 21:53.414
does match the one
used in the murder.

21:59.756 --> 22:01.956
(door closes)

22:15.311 --> 22:18.679
The coffee at our diner used to
be the best coffee in the city.

22:18.681 --> 22:20.881
There's no
chain places,

22:20.883 --> 22:23.584
one supplier for all
of the diners in town.

22:23.586 --> 22:26.354
No special bean that
comes out of a cat's ass.

22:26.356 --> 22:29.090
I didn't come down here
to reminisce about coffee.

22:29.092 --> 22:30.858
Hmm.

22:30.860 --> 22:33.928
Alex Kalamogdartis.

22:33.930 --> 22:36.197
He was not
a nice young man, Frank.

22:36.199 --> 22:39.400
Well, he died this morning.

22:40.670 --> 22:42.236
And "not nice" is not grounds

22:42.238 --> 22:44.438
for a justifiable homicide,
Nick.

22:44.440 --> 22:45.740
Rotten apple from a rotten tree.

22:45.742 --> 22:48.576
Come on, the kid had a record
as long as the old man.

22:48.578 --> 22:50.111
I know that.

22:50.113 --> 22:51.278
Tell me what happened.

22:51.280 --> 22:52.880
I got nothing to tell.

22:52.882 --> 22:54.281
I'm at my family restaurant,

22:54.283 --> 22:56.050
celebrating my freedom.

22:56.052 --> 22:57.518
In walks the kid.

22:57.520 --> 22:59.253
Hot and bothered,
stirring up trouble.

22:59.255 --> 23:00.955
Just like his old man.

23:00.957 --> 23:02.990
Next thing I know,
bodies are falling.

23:02.992 --> 23:04.325
Who fired the shots?

23:04.327 --> 23:06.293
I don't know;
it was dark, it was crowded,

23:06.295 --> 23:07.895
music was loud.

23:09.399 --> 23:10.765
Why do we have

23:10.767 --> 23:13.968
this picture of you
leaving with the gun?

23:13.970 --> 23:17.004
(exhales)

23:17.006 --> 23:18.205
I wasn't thinking, Frank.

23:18.207 --> 23:20.174
I panicked when I saw
the gun on the floor.

23:20.176 --> 23:22.877
All I could think was
I got to get it out of here.

23:22.879 --> 23:26.313
You got a problem,
or does the problem have you?

23:27.417 --> 23:29.884
You trying to cover
for somebody?

23:29.886 --> 23:30.951
Not at all.

23:30.953 --> 23:32.653
Like, maybe you got used
to life inside,

23:32.655 --> 23:34.055
had it wired pretty good.

23:34.057 --> 23:35.189
You're dead wrong.

23:35.191 --> 23:36.557
I'm not covering for anybody.

23:36.559 --> 23:38.659
Right, and you have no idea
who the shooter was

23:38.661 --> 23:40.561
in your own restaurant,
with your own people around.

23:40.563 --> 23:42.263
Nobody saw nothing.

23:46.135 --> 23:48.402
Where was your boy
when this happened?

23:48.404 --> 23:49.937
In the back.

23:49.939 --> 23:52.273
Who with?
I don't know.

23:52.275 --> 23:56.343
(sighs) I gave you the benefit
of the doubt once.

23:56.345 --> 23:58.312
You owe me the truth.

24:00.083 --> 24:03.784
I paid my debt
to the State of New York.

24:03.786 --> 24:05.820
20 years.

24:05.822 --> 24:09.423
I gave it 20 years of my life.

24:09.425 --> 24:12.193
I don't owe anybody
anything else.

24:12.195 --> 24:15.362
Not good enough.

24:15.364 --> 24:16.764
Start over.

24:18.801 --> 24:21.102
SANDI:
That's Harry.

24:21.104 --> 24:22.937
With my late
husband David.

24:22.939 --> 24:25.039
Two of them were
thick as thieves.

24:25.041 --> 24:28.576
Drinking and gambling every
night at the Old Bluff.

24:28.578 --> 24:30.544
Sandi, you said that you weren't
friends with Harry,

24:30.546 --> 24:32.646
but he kept sending you money.

24:32.648 --> 24:33.647
Why?

24:33.649 --> 24:34.782
Oh, I don't know.

24:34.784 --> 24:36.016
Maybe he felt sorry for me

24:36.018 --> 24:38.219
because I had to raise
my grandson on my own.

24:38.221 --> 24:40.755
The child has
special needs.

24:40.757 --> 24:41.989
He's smart.

24:41.991 --> 24:45.259
And he was doing well
in the program <i>I</i> sent him to.

24:45.261 --> 24:46.660
That school
they had him in?

24:46.662 --> 24:49.029
Full of screamers
and head bangers.

24:49.031 --> 24:51.198
How much was Harry sending?

24:51.200 --> 24:53.334
Are you gonna tell the IRS?

24:53.336 --> 24:54.902
No.

24:54.904 --> 24:57.571
Never more than ten grand.

24:57.573 --> 24:59.573
Every few months.

24:59.575 --> 25:01.809
Now the program says
David can't come back

25:01.811 --> 25:03.577
until I pay the next bill.

25:03.579 --> 25:05.646
Sandi, I hate to ask you this,

25:05.648 --> 25:08.983
but that's a lot of money for
a guy that didn't have a job.

25:10.052 --> 25:11.685
Do you know anything about
Harry's involvement

25:11.687 --> 25:13.154
in the Benny Trust heist?

25:15.057 --> 25:16.724
That's where my husband worked.

25:16.726 --> 25:19.560
What did he do there?

25:19.562 --> 25:21.862
He was a guard.

25:21.864 --> 25:24.999
The guard who got killed
in the robbery?

25:25.001 --> 25:28.936
The bank got their money back
from the insurance,

25:28.938 --> 25:31.405
and then went under before
they paid our benefits

25:31.407 --> 25:32.973
like they promised.

25:32.975 --> 25:35.342
Harry was the only one
looking out for us.

25:35.344 --> 25:37.578
Did you ever ask
where he got the cash?

25:37.580 --> 25:38.679
No.

25:38.681 --> 25:41.382
But I knew something
was eating him inside.

25:41.384 --> 25:43.017
And they always said

25:43.019 --> 25:45.419
the robbers must have
had an inside tip.

25:45.421 --> 25:47.354
You think Harry was the conduit,

25:47.356 --> 25:49.423
because he was drinking buddies
with your husband?

25:49.425 --> 25:51.192
He sure acted guilty around me.

25:51.194 --> 25:52.927
You think he got
a cut afterward?

25:52.929 --> 25:54.728
I don't know.

25:54.730 --> 25:56.797
I needed the money.

25:56.799 --> 25:58.532
For my grandson.

25:59.602 --> 26:02.336
I guess you got
a judgment about that, huh?

26:02.338 --> 26:05.372
I don't know what to think.

26:05.374 --> 26:08.642
So what happens now?

26:12.748 --> 26:13.681
Hey, Reagan.

26:13.683 --> 26:15.950
What the hell
do you want?

26:15.952 --> 26:18.118
I heard you had
my father here.

26:18.120 --> 26:20.154
Yeah. Well, unless you got
something new to offer

26:20.156 --> 26:21.689
that you held
back on before,

26:21.691 --> 26:23.557
there's nothing you can
do to help him now.

26:23.559 --> 26:24.758
Wait.

26:26.362 --> 26:28.662
I think you're gonna
want to hear this.

26:28.664 --> 26:32.099
Okay.

26:32.101 --> 26:33.734
Come on.

26:43.946 --> 26:46.080
(metallic click)

26:46.082 --> 26:47.281
Whew.

26:51.454 --> 26:54.288
We're good to go?

26:54.290 --> 26:55.789
GPS is working.

26:55.791 --> 26:57.691
We good with the warrant?
Just in time.

26:57.693 --> 26:59.260
Judge says,
"Kathy's her own worst enemy."

26:59.262 --> 27:01.095
If she wasn't pushing this--

27:01.097 --> 27:03.063
a live video interview
to drive up ratings--

27:03.065 --> 27:06.800
we wouldn't have probable cause
she was meeting with Jeffrey.

27:08.204 --> 27:10.271
There she is.

27:13.876 --> 27:15.743
Can't believe
she's doing this.

27:15.745 --> 27:18.812
She was one of the best trial
lawyers I ever worked with.

27:18.814 --> 27:21.882
One thing about Kathy,
she was always more about

27:21.884 --> 27:24.051
the attention
than the case.

27:25.221 --> 27:26.987
Let's go.

27:26.989 --> 27:28.656
Please, don't complain
about the driving today.

27:28.658 --> 27:29.790
(engine starts)

27:32.862 --> 27:35.029
No promises.

27:37.066 --> 27:40.034
My father's
the strongest man I know.

27:40.036 --> 27:41.969
I can never be like him.

27:41.971 --> 27:43.070
Okay.

27:43.072 --> 27:44.605
He did 20 years in state prison,

27:44.607 --> 27:46.040
and he never complained
about the food.

27:46.042 --> 27:48.075
After being in
the restaurant business.

27:49.545 --> 27:52.112
No, he...

27:52.114 --> 27:54.581
he deserves to have
his life back.

27:54.583 --> 27:56.116
He only just met
his granddaughter.

27:56.118 --> 27:59.553
I'm sure this is all
going someplace.

27:59.555 --> 28:01.588
When Alex Kalamogdartis

28:01.590 --> 28:03.624
came in the other night
and started threatening him,

28:03.626 --> 28:04.959
I couldn't take it.

28:04.961 --> 28:07.361
So you're saying you were
there during the argument.

28:07.363 --> 28:08.729
Yes, yes.

28:08.731 --> 28:09.863
I'm sorry that I lied before.

28:09.865 --> 28:11.632
Like I said,
I'm not as strong as Papa.

28:11.634 --> 28:13.867
Okay, we've moved past that.

28:13.869 --> 28:17.104
So you heard Alex threaten
your dad, then what did you do?

28:18.941 --> 28:20.975
I went, I went and I got
my cousin's gun

28:20.977 --> 28:22.176
from under the cash register.

28:22.178 --> 28:23.877
And then what?

28:23.879 --> 28:26.914
And then I just
started shooting.

28:28.684 --> 28:33.153
And shooting and shooting
and shooting and shooting!

28:34.056 --> 28:35.556
After it was done,

28:35.558 --> 28:38.692
Papa took the gun and told me
to keep my mouth shut.

28:39.495 --> 28:41.528
Okay.
I did it.

28:41.530 --> 28:42.896
Yeah.

28:42.898 --> 28:45.733
I'm gonna need you to
write that all down, okay?

28:50.840 --> 28:52.539
My father's still got

28:52.541 --> 28:54.775
a few good years left.

28:54.777 --> 28:58.579
I can't let him go back to
prison for something that I did.

29:05.654 --> 29:08.188
You want a lawyer?

29:08.190 --> 29:10.057
Now? Seriously?

29:10.059 --> 29:11.859
Yeah. It's my right.
I didn't shoot the kid.

29:11.861 --> 29:13.427
You got no right
to keep me here.

29:13.429 --> 29:14.695
You asked for me.

29:14.697 --> 29:16.563
And now you want a lawyer?

29:19.235 --> 29:21.402
It's done.

29:21.404 --> 29:22.903
He confessed.

29:37.219 --> 29:39.053
(sighs)

29:39.055 --> 29:40.254
Full statement?

29:40.256 --> 29:42.956
Signed, sealed and delivered.

29:42.958 --> 29:44.224
Good work.

29:44.226 --> 29:45.325
Stavros...
(speaks Greek)

29:45.327 --> 29:46.393
In English.

29:46.395 --> 29:48.796
Papa, I'm sorry.
Don't do this.

29:48.798 --> 29:50.697
STAVROS: I already did.
NICK: No, you didn't.

29:50.699 --> 29:52.332
I shot him, Papa.

29:52.334 --> 29:53.700
He didn't give
me a choice.

29:53.702 --> 29:55.536
Take him down
to Central Booking.

29:55.538 --> 29:56.870
Yes, sir. Come on.
Wait a minute.

29:56.872 --> 29:58.338
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!

30:05.548 --> 30:07.714
(sighs)

30:11.787 --> 30:15.389
I don't think you're gonna
let him do this, Nick.

30:15.391 --> 30:19.660
You're not a perfect man,
but you love your family

30:19.662 --> 30:21.829
and you love your son.

30:28.037 --> 30:30.904
It's how
it had to be, Frank.

30:30.906 --> 30:35.342
Otherwise, those people
were never gonna let us be.

30:35.344 --> 30:37.511
Ready to make
a statement?

30:37.513 --> 30:40.647
Yes, I am.

30:45.054 --> 30:47.888
We got the cuffs
on the wrong man.

31:00.437 --> 31:02.704
♪ ♪

31:20.991 --> 31:22.691
Nice ride.
Smart.

31:22.692 --> 31:24.946
Jeffrey knew
we'd be looking for him

31:24.947 --> 31:27.481
at the airfields, so he's
all set to get away by land.

31:27.483 --> 31:30.517
Well, I guess looking back,
I could've seen the signs.

31:30.519 --> 31:33.020
Beth was always
a little flighty.

31:33.022 --> 31:35.122
That was part of the energy
that drew me to her.

31:35.124 --> 31:36.490
She started
disappearing for

31:36.492 --> 31:38.158
longer and longer
periods of time.

31:38.160 --> 31:40.460
And then one night,
she just didn't come back.

31:40.462 --> 31:41.728
(door opens)

31:42.431 --> 31:44.264
You two, sit down.

31:45.434 --> 31:46.967
And shut that off.

31:47.703 --> 31:50.304
On your feet, Doc.
Come on.

31:50.306 --> 31:52.906
Come on!

31:52.908 --> 31:54.908
Looks like this interview
is over, Kathy.

31:54.910 --> 31:57.177
Jeffrey Durning, we have
a warrant for your arrest.

31:58.380 --> 31:59.413
Wait, this is all wrong.

31:59.415 --> 32:01.915
We also have a warrant
for <i>your</i> arrest.

32:01.917 --> 32:03.417
For what?

32:03.419 --> 32:04.384
Hindering prosecution.

32:04.386 --> 32:06.186
You lied to us
about where he was,

32:06.188 --> 32:07.888
and you're assisting a fugitive.

32:07.890 --> 32:09.289
Wait.

32:09.291 --> 32:10.991
There's something
you need to see

32:10.993 --> 32:12.859
that changes this whole case.

32:12.861 --> 32:14.227
Oh, really?

32:16.065 --> 32:17.331
This...

32:17.333 --> 32:19.333
was taken in Caracas

32:19.335 --> 32:21.401
two days ago
by a friend of Beth's.

32:22.404 --> 32:24.371
She's still alive.

32:31.146 --> 32:32.512
(groans)
Hey.

32:32.514 --> 32:34.948
Hey. Put the brisket
in the fridge.

32:34.950 --> 32:37.317
I got us a bottle of wine;
we're in business.

32:37.319 --> 32:38.285
Grandpa,

32:38.287 --> 32:40.654
do you remember
the Benny Trust heist?

32:40.656 --> 32:42.122
Oh, sure I do.

32:42.124 --> 32:43.690
Happened when I was PC.

32:43.692 --> 32:45.692
We always heard that
it was an inside job,

32:45.694 --> 32:47.260
but we could
never prove it.

32:47.262 --> 32:49.429
Most of the thieves
killed each other

32:49.431 --> 32:51.598
before they could
spend the money. Why?

32:51.600 --> 32:53.667
Just a hypothetical,
but what if I told you

32:53.669 --> 32:56.069
that I found
some of the money?

32:56.071 --> 32:57.604
I'd say forget
the brisket,

32:57.606 --> 33:00.507
you're taking us to Peter
Luger's for family dinner.

33:00.509 --> 33:01.908
(chuckles)

33:03.779 --> 33:06.513
Seriously, it's a closed case,
isn't it?

33:06.515 --> 33:10.684
No, the term is "not an
active investigation."

33:10.686 --> 33:12.419
Big difference.

33:14.456 --> 33:16.456
Let's just say
a couple of partners

33:16.458 --> 33:19.059
stumble on a bundle of cash
in a dead man's apartment.

33:19.061 --> 33:21.928
Well, if they take
it for themselves,

33:21.930 --> 33:26.366
they're out of a job and
maybe on their way to prison.

33:26.368 --> 33:29.069
Let's just say though that
they've made all the right calls

33:29.071 --> 33:30.904
and turns out
nobody's looking for that money,

33:30.906 --> 33:33.106
but it's clear
that the dead guy

33:33.108 --> 33:35.809
wanted to leave it to somebody
who really needed it.

33:35.811 --> 33:37.978
He died without
leaving a will?

33:37.980 --> 33:39.546
Yeah.

33:39.548 --> 33:41.848
Well, then it goes to
the public administrator.

33:41.850 --> 33:44.418
What if they just
don't find all of it?

33:44.420 --> 33:49.156
Well, then these partners
have an interesting dilemma.

33:52.227 --> 33:54.861
A few years before the heist,

33:54.863 --> 33:57.631
I was up in the Bronx
for the Big Blackout.

33:59.101 --> 34:00.867
The looting was insane.

34:00.869 --> 34:03.603
We were locking up people
left, right and center.

34:03.605 --> 34:07.340
Someone had broken
the front window

34:07.342 --> 34:11.445
of a store that charged
the most ridiculous prices.

34:11.447 --> 34:15.649
I saw a lady my age,
with three little kids,

34:15.650 --> 34:18.318
carrying out a bag
full of diapers and groceries.

34:19.855 --> 34:23.023
I looked her
straight in the eye...

34:23.025 --> 34:24.690
and I let her go.

34:24.693 --> 34:28.027
I made a
judgment call.

34:28.030 --> 34:31.797
Every good cop's
got to be able to make one.

34:31.800 --> 34:35.034
Not that we're talking about
anything real here.

34:43.746 --> 34:45.078
(video game beeping quietly)

34:45.080 --> 34:46.480
You sure this is okay?

34:46.482 --> 34:48.815
The public administrators
are already done.

34:48.817 --> 34:50.484
You're the closest thing
to a family friend.

34:50.485 --> 34:52.518
We're just giving you
a chance to pick out

34:52.521 --> 34:54.688
some clothes for Harry,
for the funeral.

34:54.690 --> 34:57.858
No one else is coming?

34:57.860 --> 34:59.926
He had no will,
no heirs.

34:59.928 --> 35:02.062
Just the letter to you.

35:02.064 --> 35:03.497
So, we'll give
you an hour.

35:03.499 --> 35:05.298
Whatever you leave behind
goes to the landlady

35:05.300 --> 35:07.868
or the-the
clean-out company.

35:08.704 --> 35:10.370
Just...

35:10.372 --> 35:13.907
make sure you look everywhere--
the cupboards, the closets...

35:15.043 --> 35:17.978
...under the bed.

35:31.093 --> 35:32.859
I'm still not
sure about this.

35:32.861 --> 35:34.561
Public administrators
got most of the cash

35:34.563 --> 35:35.896
that was just lying around.

35:35.898 --> 35:36.930
We both know there's more.

35:36.932 --> 35:38.932
And no one's looking for it.

35:38.934 --> 35:40.867
Sandi needs that money
to keep her grandson

35:40.869 --> 35:42.102
in that special school.

35:42.104 --> 35:44.938
Just doesn't feel right.

35:44.940 --> 35:47.474
What if someone starts
asking questions later?

35:47.476 --> 35:51.845
Guess you'll have to decide
if you're gonna rat me out.

35:58.420 --> 36:02.589
I can't believe you had me
arrested on felony charges.

36:02.591 --> 36:04.324
Well, you knew
where Jeffrey Durning was

36:04.326 --> 36:06.760
and you chose to mislead us
and protect him.

36:06.762 --> 36:08.829
The flaw in
your argument

36:08.831 --> 36:10.530
is that there is
no underlying crime.

36:10.532 --> 36:11.965
Really?

36:11.967 --> 36:13.733
I've given you proof.

36:13.735 --> 36:16.303
You mean that picture
from Venezuela?

36:16.305 --> 36:18.905
It kind of blows the whole case
out of the water, Anthony,

36:18.907 --> 36:20.640
doesn't it?
One little problem.

36:20.642 --> 36:23.410
I just got off the phone
with the guy in the photo.

36:23.412 --> 36:25.378
He's five-foot-six.

36:25.380 --> 36:27.214
Beth was five-foot-ten.

36:27.216 --> 36:30.383
And in the photo,
she's looking up at him.

36:31.720 --> 36:33.720
How's a woman
who's four inches taller

36:33.722 --> 36:35.622
appearing shorter?

36:39.461 --> 36:41.261
Obviously, it
would be tough.

36:41.263 --> 36:42.996
I'd say.

36:42.998 --> 36:44.164
Doesn't mean I'm wrong
about everything.

36:44.166 --> 36:45.999
You're just trying
to neutralize me

36:46.001 --> 36:47.901
because you're afraid
the former prosecutor

36:47.903 --> 36:49.870
is gonna make Jeffrey's defense
a slam dunk.

36:49.872 --> 36:52.706
What about all the witnesses
Jeffrey intimidated?

36:52.708 --> 36:54.708
Their stories didn't hold up.

36:54.710 --> 36:57.344
Then why did Jeffrey go to
Mindy's apartment the other day

36:57.346 --> 36:58.578
and threaten her?

37:02.384 --> 37:05.018
He's worried the truth
will come out.

37:06.889 --> 37:08.955
I had no idea he'd done this.

37:08.957 --> 37:12.559
You let your ego get ahead
of the facts in this case,

37:12.561 --> 37:15.362
and you've been poisoning
the jury pool with your podcast.

37:15.364 --> 37:17.764
I thought I had a subject
who was innocent.

37:17.766 --> 37:19.032
Is it safe to say

37:19.034 --> 37:21.167
that you could've
handled things differently?

37:23.972 --> 37:27.140
I'll give you what I have
on Jeffrey from my files.

37:35.317 --> 37:37.417
Bless us, oh Lord,
in these thy gifts,

37:37.419 --> 37:39.586
which we are about to
receive from thy bounty

37:39.588 --> 37:41.388
through Christ our Lord. Amen.

37:41.390 --> 37:42.822
ALL:
Amen.

37:42.824 --> 37:44.491
Ah, the prodigal son.

37:44.493 --> 37:46.126
Better late than never.

37:46.128 --> 37:47.227
What took you?

37:47.229 --> 37:48.962
I texted Erin I was
running a little behind.

37:48.964 --> 37:49.963
He did.

37:49.965 --> 37:51.865
Where were you?

37:51.867 --> 37:53.033
Uh, funeral.

37:53.035 --> 37:54.601
Whose?

37:54.603 --> 37:55.702
Just a guy.

37:55.704 --> 37:57.504
You know him well?

37:57.506 --> 37:58.672
Uh, no.

37:58.674 --> 38:00.173
Actually didn't know him at all.

38:00.175 --> 38:01.608
Turns out, nobody really did.

38:01.610 --> 38:03.076
What's that mean?

38:03.078 --> 38:04.778
Means he barely
came out of his house

38:04.780 --> 38:07.080
or spoke to anyone for 25 years,
and passed away

38:07.082 --> 38:08.782
without anyone really wondering
where he went.

38:08.784 --> 38:10.650
That may be one of the saddest
things I've ever heard.

38:10.652 --> 38:12.218
How deep did you dig?

38:12.220 --> 38:13.453
Didn't really dig, actually.

38:13.455 --> 38:16.222
Just a few days sitting with
his stuff and waiting for

38:16.224 --> 38:17.891
the public
administrators to show.

38:17.893 --> 38:20.460
Did he have something to hide,
something he was hiding from?

38:20.462 --> 38:21.661
No record.

38:21.663 --> 38:24.230
At least not under
any of the names that we had.

38:24.232 --> 38:26.166
Well, maybe he never got caught;
couldn't forgive himself.

38:26.168 --> 38:27.767
LINDA:
Any more of this,

38:27.769 --> 38:29.970
and I'm gonna have to go
back to church

38:29.972 --> 38:31.805
and pray for his poor soul.
Right?

38:31.807 --> 38:33.373
So you actually
went to the funeral

38:33.375 --> 38:34.774
for someone you never met?

38:35.644 --> 38:36.977
Yeah.

38:36.979 --> 38:39.145
Ever done that before?

38:39.147 --> 38:41.314
Nope. Just felt like I should.

38:41.316 --> 38:42.449
That's it?

38:45.754 --> 38:48.388
Yeah, kind of hard to explain.

38:48.390 --> 38:50.357
At least for me it is.

38:52.394 --> 38:54.761
Wow, you give this family
half an opportunity,

38:54.763 --> 38:57.097
and the questions
just don't stop.

38:57.099 --> 38:58.999
Sorry I
brought it up.

38:59.835 --> 39:02.902
Nicky, boys,

39:02.904 --> 39:05.839
you hear a lot of harsh stories
at this table.

39:05.841 --> 39:07.107
I don't think
they're harsh.

39:07.109 --> 39:08.575
Cool, maybe.

39:08.577 --> 39:09.943
Okay, ear of the beholder.

39:09.945 --> 39:12.912
But if there's one thing
you need to take away

39:12.914 --> 39:15.515
from this table, I hope
it's that you don't have to be

39:15.517 --> 39:18.284
Jamie's age, or
Danny's or Erin's

39:18.286 --> 39:20.253
or mine or Pop's
for that matter,

39:20.255 --> 39:23.523
to learn to show some grace
where it's needed.

39:23.525 --> 39:26.593
To save some grace
for strangers even,

39:26.595 --> 39:30.163
who find themselves
without family or friends.

39:30.165 --> 39:33.800
Or whatever reason
got them there.

39:34.636 --> 39:36.603
Will do.
Me, too.

39:36.605 --> 39:38.171
I'll try.

39:39.307 --> 39:43.009
I'd like to think
the reward is in the attempt.

39:43.011 --> 39:44.644
Well, the good news is,

39:44.646 --> 39:47.247
none of us is ever
gonna end up alone.

39:48.550 --> 39:52.385
Not while another one
of us is still standing.

39:53.755 --> 39:55.555
And again, amen.
