WEBVTT

00:11.159 --> 00:15.160
She can go into people's bodies.

00:15.162 --> 00:17.235
Said the ghost
has scratched him.

00:17.237 --> 00:20.342
I yelled at whatever was here,
"Leave!"

00:20.344 --> 00:22.743
Something is so physically wrong
with her.

00:24.879 --> 00:27.181
The body was chopped up
and thrown into the harbor.

00:27.183 --> 00:30.052
This is un-[bleep]- bearable.

00:30.054 --> 00:32.787
So much pain!

00:33.958 --> 00:35.729
It's really bad in here.

00:35.731 --> 00:38.768
My name is Amy Allan.

00:38.770 --> 00:40.972
Something is not right.

00:40.974 --> 00:42.109
I see dead people.

00:42.111 --> 00:44.280
This person might have been
a serial killer.

00:44.282 --> 00:46.181
I speak to dead people.

00:46.183 --> 00:47.718
You get those chills.

00:47.720 --> 00:49.289
And they speak to me.

00:49.291 --> 00:51.830
He is darkness.
He is evil.

00:51.832 --> 00:54.839
But there's only one way to know
if my findings are real.

00:54.841 --> 00:56.508
I think she broke her neck.

00:56.510 --> 00:57.876
I rely on my partner.

00:57.878 --> 00:59.578
I'm Steve di Shiavi.

00:59.580 --> 01:01.681
I'm a retired New York City
Homicide detective.

01:01.683 --> 01:03.218
You telling me the truth?

01:03.220 --> 01:06.791
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:06.793 --> 01:08.427
I think the devil is down here.

01:08.429 --> 01:09.929
It's my job to reveal them.

01:09.931 --> 01:11.097
Who the hell would do this?

01:11.099 --> 01:13.535
But Steve and I never speak...

01:13.537 --> 01:15.504
we never communicate
during an investigation.

01:15.506 --> 01:16.871
...until the very end.

01:16.873 --> 01:18.242
Who's he looking to kill?

01:18.244 --> 01:20.214
We uncover if it's safe
for you to stay...

01:20.216 --> 01:22.516
You need to get out of here
right now.

01:22.518 --> 01:23.618
Or time to get out.

01:23.620 --> 01:26.425
It was like endless darkness.

01:28.000 --> 01:34.074

01:40.813 --> 01:43.787
Amy and I conduct
separate investigations.

01:45.025 --> 01:47.660
I hear what living witnesses
have to say

01:47.662 --> 01:51.032
and uncover any secrets
buried in the property's past

01:51.034 --> 01:53.773
while Amy talks with the dead.

01:53.775 --> 01:56.580
I'm in historic
Winthrop, Massachusetts.

01:56.582 --> 01:59.351
It's about 15 minutes
outside of Boston.

01:59.353 --> 02:01.989
Amy and I got called in
by a woman named Cynthia.

02:01.991 --> 02:04.056
Now, she was hysterical
on the phone.

02:05.392 --> 02:07.393
She says
that whatever's in the house

02:07.395 --> 02:10.731
is attacking her 14-year-old
son, who has special needs.

02:10.733 --> 02:12.534
She says if we can't help,

02:12.536 --> 02:14.336
she's afraid
what's going to happen next.

02:22.043 --> 02:24.011
Before Amy arrives,

02:24.013 --> 02:26.982
I look for anything that could
reveal information to her,

02:26.984 --> 02:29.486
like family photographs.

02:29.488 --> 02:31.988
Once I conceal them all,

02:31.990 --> 02:34.692
the location will be ready
for tonight's walk.

02:44.072 --> 02:47.309
I don't feel good.

02:51.282 --> 02:53.548
There's some woman there.

02:53.550 --> 02:56.051
She's making me so sick.

02:57.788 --> 03:00.889
The dead know I'm coming
long before I do.

03:00.891 --> 03:03.459
And one dead woman
from this location

03:03.461 --> 03:05.927
is desperate
to have her story told.

03:05.929 --> 03:08.930
Oh, man.
That is some pain, man.

03:08.932 --> 03:12.900
She's jumped me,
entered my body.

03:12.902 --> 03:15.201
And I'm experiencing her pain,

03:15.203 --> 03:19.039
which is so intense
that I'm scared for my safety.

03:20.475 --> 03:23.276
This is not good.

03:26.448 --> 03:31.887
This woman that showed up,
she is very sick.

03:31.889 --> 03:37.060
She's obviously inconsolable

03:37.062 --> 03:39.694
and in so much pain.

03:41.598 --> 03:44.400
This is un-[bleep]- bearable.

03:53.910 --> 03:56.946
Cynthia, you sounded
really concerned on the phone.

03:56.948 --> 04:02.314
We've had a lot of noises,
tapping, banging.

04:02.316 --> 04:05.451
I've seen things, shadows.

04:05.453 --> 04:07.820
But, really,
the reason why I've called

04:07.822 --> 04:10.423
is my youngest son, Nathaniel.

04:10.425 --> 04:13.262
He's 14
and is in the autism spectrum.

04:13.264 --> 04:15.995
And I really feel
this is affecting him.

04:15.997 --> 04:18.096
Okay. In what way?

04:18.099 --> 04:21.333
Well, he's actually
been scratched a few times.

04:21.334 --> 04:22.467
He's frightened.

04:22.469 --> 04:24.938
And he's not quite the same
anymore,

04:24.940 --> 04:26.539
since we've moved in here.

04:26.541 --> 04:28.906
He was a fun kid,
really outgoing.

04:28.908 --> 04:29.974
Okay.

04:29.976 --> 04:31.644
I called him the mayor.

04:31.646 --> 04:34.345
He would be all bubbly
and talk to anyone.

04:34.347 --> 04:37.245
And he's just different.

04:37.247 --> 04:39.680
There's no joy anymore.

04:39.682 --> 04:42.948
I'm so mad to see him afraid.

04:42.950 --> 04:45.082
And I yelled at whatever
was here to leave him alone.

04:45.084 --> 04:47.815
"My home, my child.

04:47.817 --> 04:49.449
Leave."

04:49.451 --> 04:50.850
It didn't cut it.

04:50.852 --> 04:54.184
I don't know what to do for him
anymore. I really don't.

04:57.787 --> 05:01.055
This girl that jumped me,

05:01.057 --> 05:05.456
she can go into people's bodies
very easily.

05:05.458 --> 05:08.961
So, I had to, like,
disconnect a little bit

05:08.963 --> 05:13.100
because she was
making me so sick.

05:23.776 --> 05:27.712
She inadvertently jumps people.

05:27.714 --> 05:29.914
And she is seeking help.

05:29.916 --> 05:33.016
Unfortunately, her presence

05:33.018 --> 05:39.160
can make people feel
very, very depressed...

05:39.162 --> 05:42.259
And suicidal.

05:45.127 --> 05:47.429
So, now, who lives in the house
with you?

05:47.431 --> 05:50.333
Well, my husband lives here
with myself and Nathaniel.

05:50.335 --> 05:52.265
And I have two older sons
that live here, as well.

05:52.267 --> 05:53.597
Okay.

05:53.599 --> 05:56.598
And this was my parents' house,
and I grew up here.

05:56.600 --> 05:58.834
Oh, okay.

05:58.836 --> 06:00.970
And I wanted to
come back to my home.

06:00.972 --> 06:03.039
Well, did you have any
experiences when you were...

06:03.041 --> 06:04.174
Yes.

06:04.176 --> 06:06.110
As soon as my parents
bought this house,

06:06.112 --> 06:07.312
we all had experiences.

06:07.314 --> 06:10.182
Did you have any hesitation
about buying it, then?

06:10.184 --> 06:11.651
Yeah.

06:11.653 --> 06:13.486
I had a catholic priest
come in,

06:13.488 --> 06:15.689
bless the house,
and pray for Nathaniel.

06:15.691 --> 06:18.794
And I was confident that
that would be sufficient.

06:18.796 --> 06:21.432
Now I do feel guilty.

06:21.434 --> 06:22.467
Okay.

06:22.469 --> 06:24.300
Your parents
have both passed away?

06:24.302 --> 06:25.834
Yeah. This is my dad.

06:25.836 --> 06:29.205
He passed away here at home
in '95.

06:29.207 --> 06:31.941
He had pancreatic cancer.

06:31.943 --> 06:33.342
Ah, geez.

06:33.344 --> 06:35.544
So, now, he passes.
What about mom?

06:36.815 --> 06:39.348
She passed in the nursing home.

06:39.350 --> 06:42.684
When I bought the house,
she was very upset.

06:42.686 --> 06:44.656
Okay.
Was there a reason for that?

06:44.658 --> 06:46.224
I have no idea.

06:46.226 --> 06:48.426
After it closed,
she left me a message

06:48.428 --> 06:50.797
that she didn't want me
to have the house.

06:50.799 --> 06:52.665
Yeah, but it's to her daughter.

06:52.667 --> 06:54.030
She made it quite clear.

06:54.032 --> 06:56.030
Okay. Did you get along
with your mom?

06:56.032 --> 06:57.301
Um...

06:57.551 --> 07:00.783
she was a very
irritable-type person.

07:00.785 --> 07:04.322
She had a really bad temper.

07:04.324 --> 07:06.026
Okay.

07:06.028 --> 07:09.027
Did you ever
resolve your mother

07:09.029 --> 07:10.797
being upset with you
buying the house?

07:10.799 --> 07:12.833
No, not at all.

07:19.574 --> 07:21.743
There is an old lady.

07:22.719 --> 07:25.615
She watches.
She's always like this...

07:27.619 --> 07:33.589
Her thing is that if
she showed herself for real,

07:33.591 --> 07:36.261
nobody would be afraid of her.

07:36.263 --> 07:38.396
Because who's going to be afraid
of a little old lady?

07:38.398 --> 07:41.097
So, she makes herself tall.

07:41.099 --> 07:42.766
Like, if she stands straight up,

07:42.768 --> 07:45.168
she can put her head
through the ceiling.

07:45.170 --> 07:50.372
She has, like, a long,
spindly, like, neck

07:50.374 --> 07:52.639
and, like, skeleton legs.

07:52.641 --> 07:57.912
It's a very strange composition
of pieces.

07:59.849 --> 08:05.820
She's angry, bitter,
resentful, hateful.

08:05.822 --> 08:12.192
And when this lady was alive,
she was very distant and cold.

08:12.194 --> 08:15.829
She hates humanity in general.

08:15.831 --> 08:18.964
And, you know,
she had to, like, hide that.

08:18.966 --> 08:22.035
Do you know when she's from?

08:24.172 --> 08:28.144
She says that she was alive
in the '50s.

08:28.146 --> 08:30.110
Okay.

08:30.112 --> 08:33.650
And she was a housewife.

08:39.958 --> 08:42.159
Why'd you bring me
in this room?

08:42.162 --> 08:45.342
Well, Nathaniel won't go in
his room -- frightened to death.

08:45.462 --> 08:48.868
So, we had to trade bedrooms.

08:48.870 --> 08:51.568
My husband and I
are now sleeping in his room.

08:53.839 --> 08:55.676
That was my bedroom as a child.

08:55.678 --> 08:57.710
The bedroom set
that's in there now,

08:57.712 --> 09:00.046
that actually was
my parents' bedroom set.

09:00.048 --> 09:02.051
Oh, really?
When they passed, I kept it.

09:02.053 --> 09:03.786
Okay.
That's interesting.

09:03.788 --> 09:06.154
Now, are things
any better for you

09:06.156 --> 09:07.060
that you're in the other room?

09:07.180 --> 09:09.360
No, actually.

09:09.480 --> 09:13.028
I've been having
terrible nightmares, you know,

09:13.030 --> 09:15.931
where someone gets injured
in a boating accident

09:15.933 --> 09:18.033
or crossing the road
and getting hit.

09:18.035 --> 09:20.013
It's just...
they're violent accidents.

09:20.131 --> 09:22.631
And I'm not one
to dream like that.

09:22.633 --> 09:25.699
Are you taking any medication
that may cause weird dreams?

09:25.701 --> 09:27.001
No, nothing at all.

09:27.003 --> 09:28.604
How are you living like this?

09:28.606 --> 09:30.006
It's terrible.

09:30.008 --> 09:32.675
Here I am, an adult, and I sleep
with a night-light in there.

09:39.816 --> 09:44.153
I do feel like
a child is being chased...

09:44.155 --> 09:45.587
and a woman.

09:45.589 --> 09:49.727
Like, emotionally,
they're getting chased here.

09:49.729 --> 09:51.798
What do you mean?

09:51.800 --> 09:54.367
I don't know how to explain it.

09:54.369 --> 09:58.503
Are they being chased
in their nightmares, maybe?

10:08.013 --> 10:10.985
Oh, she likes this room.

10:14.088 --> 10:15.622
Mm.

10:15.624 --> 10:18.893
She does things in the bed.

10:18.895 --> 10:24.900
She likes to stand right here,
slide down real slow,

10:24.902 --> 10:29.137
and then, like, be on the floor,
all the way on the floor.

10:29.139 --> 10:31.874
And then, she'll like --
you know, she'll strangle.

10:31.876 --> 10:35.110
But when she touches her,
she takes her life.

10:37.048 --> 10:39.151
What do you mean?

10:40.520 --> 10:42.819
She is going to kill her.

11:07.324 --> 11:10.362
So, Nicholas, I understand
that this was Nathaniel's room,

11:10.364 --> 11:12.197
but you're sleeping in here?
Yes.

11:12.199 --> 11:13.463
So, let me ask you,

11:13.465 --> 11:15.098
what was the breaking point
for him to move out of here?

11:15.100 --> 11:16.700
Well, one night,
in the middle of the night,

11:16.702 --> 11:18.469
he came running into our room

11:18.471 --> 11:20.771
and said,
"There's a guy in my room" --

11:20.773 --> 11:23.904
a shadow man, shadow figure,
however he said it.

11:23.906 --> 11:25.206
And he wouldn't
come back in his room.

11:25.208 --> 11:26.475
He said,
"I'm not going back in there.

11:26.477 --> 11:28.843
I'm not sleeping in there
again."

11:28.845 --> 11:30.614
Got to figure out
what's going on here.

11:30.616 --> 11:31.985
This is too much.

11:31.987 --> 11:34.490
Your wife said he was getting
physically attacked.

11:34.492 --> 11:36.124
Well, actually, one day,
he woke up.

11:36.126 --> 11:38.360
And then he came and says,
"Mommy, look at my arm."

11:38.362 --> 11:41.798
And we took a picture,
and that's what we saw.

11:41.800 --> 11:44.102
And I said,
"What happened?"

11:44.104 --> 11:45.471
He says, "A ghost did it."

11:45.473 --> 11:47.907
He said the ghost
had scratched him.

11:47.909 --> 11:49.910
Did you guys question him
about that?

11:49.912 --> 11:52.916
Yeah. I mean,
my first thing is, like,

11:52.918 --> 11:54.988
"Maybe you scratched yourself
when you're sleeping."

11:54.990 --> 11:56.790
He said no, he wasn't.
He was pretty adamant.

11:56.792 --> 11:58.490
He says,
"I wasn't sleeping."

11:58.492 --> 12:00.927
There's no way he would ever
make up anything

12:00.929 --> 12:03.666
or do that
and then tell us something else.

12:07.171 --> 12:11.744
The old lady,
she likes it in this area.

12:13.081 --> 12:14.882
She wants to freak people out

12:14.884 --> 12:17.519
and make them leave
and not come in here.

12:22.824 --> 12:30.062
She is very, very proud
of inflicting pain.

12:30.064 --> 12:31.831
What kind of pain?

12:31.833 --> 12:35.101
People get scratched here.

12:36.602 --> 12:39.134
What about yourself?
Are you having any experiences?

12:39.136 --> 12:41.771
Well, the first night I
came in here, I had a nightmare.

12:41.773 --> 12:45.307
I thought it was real, the most
vivid dream I probably ever had.

12:45.309 --> 12:46.674
I was looking up at a plane.

12:46.676 --> 12:48.109
The plane started coming down

12:48.111 --> 12:51.642
and, you know, exploded,
right into the ground.

12:51.644 --> 12:55.313
Dreams, like, with screaming
people in it and violence.

12:55.315 --> 12:58.183
It's kind of interesting
how you and your wife

12:58.185 --> 13:01.086
are having
the same type of dreams.

13:01.088 --> 13:03.257
Is it just dreams you're experiencing?
No.

13:03.259 --> 13:06.830
One night, I woke up wide awake
about 3:00 in the morning.

13:06.832 --> 13:09.328
I looked up,
and I saw a shadow.

13:09.330 --> 13:12.165
And it was going back and forth
across the top of the door.

13:12.167 --> 13:14.269
Like, you could see it
blocking the light.

13:14.271 --> 13:16.704
It was about a minute,
at least a minute.

13:16.706 --> 13:20.205
And then I got up,
and I started to come over here.

13:20.207 --> 13:21.740
And there was nothing here.

13:21.742 --> 13:24.947
This stuff is confusing to me.

13:24.949 --> 13:26.515
We've prayed.

13:26.517 --> 13:28.652
And the priest
across the street,

13:28.654 --> 13:31.155
he came in and blessed the house
and prayed for Nathaniel.

13:31.157 --> 13:36.395
What I've done, you know,
isn't the answer.

13:36.397 --> 13:39.363
So, to me, this would be
like a last resort, even,

13:39.365 --> 13:40.698
you know, you guys here.

13:40.700 --> 13:44.569
I believe, like, pretty basic,
like, black and white,

13:44.571 --> 13:47.538
like angels and demons,
you know, good and bad.

13:47.540 --> 13:50.373
Right.
What do you think this is?

13:50.375 --> 13:51.542
There's something wrong.

13:54.348 --> 13:56.517
There's something else
that's going on here

13:56.519 --> 13:59.957
with these doors, this hallway.

14:01.328 --> 14:04.228
I'm thinking right now
it's the old lady.

14:04.230 --> 14:07.866
Why is she so weird
about how she moves?

14:07.868 --> 14:09.867
Mm. She says...
Oh, no, yeah.

14:09.869 --> 14:12.800
That adds to, like,
the creepy, creepy factor.

14:14.935 --> 14:17.337
She's a sociopath.

14:18.804 --> 14:22.036
She's chasing them,
these two people.

14:22.038 --> 14:24.672
One is the living woman.

14:24.674 --> 14:28.908
And the other one,
I think it's a boy.

14:35.147 --> 14:36.848
I was talking to mom and dad,

14:36.850 --> 14:38.050
and mom was telling me

14:38.052 --> 14:40.350
that you're having a tough time
in the house.

14:40.352 --> 14:41.584
Oh, yeah.

14:41.586 --> 14:45.889
When I go upstairs, it takes me
a while to fall asleep

14:45.891 --> 14:48.125
because I feel like I'm being
watched for some reason.

14:48.127 --> 14:52.058
And a couple times,
I saw this weird black thing.

14:52.060 --> 14:54.529
It was just, like, an outline.

14:54.531 --> 14:56.366
And what did it do?

14:56.368 --> 14:58.366
It just stands there
for like five seconds.

14:58.368 --> 14:59.700
And what happened?

14:59.702 --> 15:01.000
It just completely disappeared.

15:01.002 --> 15:03.269
I got so scared,

15:03.271 --> 15:05.638
I actually switched rooms
with my parents.

15:05.640 --> 15:07.040
Okay.

15:07.042 --> 15:09.541
Dad showed me a picture
of a scratch on your arm.

15:09.543 --> 15:10.577
Yes.

15:10.579 --> 15:11.879
What happened?

15:11.881 --> 15:13.114
I felt, like, a weird burning.

15:13.116 --> 15:15.550
And I looked,
and it was a weird scratch.

15:15.552 --> 15:17.452
Did the cat do it or anything?

15:17.454 --> 15:20.922
No, definitely not
because it was perfectly fine.

15:20.924 --> 15:22.689
And then,
like five minutes later,

15:22.691 --> 15:24.223
there was a weird scratch.

15:24.225 --> 15:26.092
Would you be afraid
to be alone in the house?

15:26.094 --> 15:27.228
Yes, actually.

15:27.230 --> 15:29.098
Okay.
What about your old bedroom?

15:29.100 --> 15:30.834
That's the worst.

15:33.468 --> 15:35.972
Old lady does weird [bleep]
up here.

15:38.843 --> 15:41.010
What does she do?

15:41.012 --> 15:42.779
She does weird stuff
on the floor up in here.

15:45.216 --> 15:49.685
And then,
there's someone crying about it,

15:49.687 --> 15:52.388
being afraid about it.

15:54.759 --> 15:58.729
I think it takes her a lot
to murder someone.

15:58.731 --> 16:00.731
So, she's focused on

16:00.733 --> 16:03.399
offing a living woman
that lives here now.

16:06.836 --> 16:10.071
She's just kind of trying to
get that done and over with.

16:10.073 --> 16:12.307
And then, she'll move on
to the next person.

16:13.305 --> 16:16.910
She's definitely, like,
screwing with the kid now.

16:31.837 --> 16:33.117
You know you're in the northeast

16:33.119 --> 16:34.789
when you trace the history
on a property

16:34.791 --> 16:36.293
and it takes you back
to the 1600s.

16:36.295 --> 16:38.766
Turns out, the first settlers
on my client's property

16:38.768 --> 16:40.968
lived there
for a couple hundred years.

16:40.970 --> 16:43.640
I asked a local genealogist
to look into it for me,

16:43.642 --> 16:45.875
and he said he found something
that will help my case.

16:55.184 --> 16:57.818
You know, Steve,
this is one of the oldest deeds

16:57.820 --> 16:59.152
I've ever searched through.

16:59.154 --> 17:00.717
It goes back to the 1600s.

17:00.719 --> 17:03.587
And I came across
the Bill and Belcher families.

17:03.589 --> 17:04.586
Mm-hmm.

17:04.588 --> 17:05.819
What can you tell me
about them?

17:05.821 --> 17:08.821
In November of 1635,

17:08.824 --> 17:10.824
John Bill and his wife

17:10.826 --> 17:12.824
came from England
with their family.

17:12.826 --> 17:16.624
And by 1690, the family
owns most of Pullen Poynt,

17:16.626 --> 17:18.425
today's Winthrop.
Okay.

17:18.428 --> 17:20.964
So, how does the Belcher family
get involved?

17:20.967 --> 17:26.003
Well, in 1697, Hannah Bill
marries Joseph Belcher.

17:26.006 --> 17:28.307
Okay. So, these were two
pretty prominent families, then.

17:28.309 --> 17:30.076
Exactly.

17:30.078 --> 17:31.843
Now, you said there was
some information on the phone

17:31.845 --> 17:33.578
that would help my case.
What were you talking about?

17:33.580 --> 17:36.183
Well, I went through
over 200 years of records.

17:36.185 --> 17:39.052
And, of course, there's deaths,
standard things...

17:39.054 --> 17:41.555
That is
until the mid-to late-1800s.

17:41.557 --> 17:43.525
Okay.
During that period,

17:43.527 --> 17:47.962
a dozen Belcher children
under the age of four die.

17:47.964 --> 17:50.166
Okay.
Do you know what they died from?

17:50.168 --> 17:53.471
You might want to take a look
at some of these death records.

17:55.340 --> 17:58.575
Most of it was common ailments
of the time --

17:58.577 --> 18:00.144
cholera, consumption,

18:00.146 --> 18:02.745
what we know today
as tuberculosis.

18:02.747 --> 18:04.879
So, we're talking about
some kind of an epidemic?

18:04.881 --> 18:06.547
No.

18:06.549 --> 18:11.923
But in the 1700s, there was
an outbreak of smallpox.

18:11.925 --> 18:13.558
And that was in the area
I'm investigating?

18:13.560 --> 18:14.558
Exactly.

18:14.560 --> 18:16.426
Okay.

18:18.393 --> 18:21.393
I saw the old lady.

18:21.395 --> 18:26.191
And then I saw
these three little kids.

18:26.193 --> 18:30.097
And she was claiming
that she killed them.

18:31.634 --> 18:38.072
Then I heard a man say
that she didn't kill them.

18:39.778 --> 18:41.414
This is not a good room.

18:41.416 --> 18:43.782
Pain and then pain, pain.

18:43.784 --> 18:46.183
Blood and death and pain.

18:47.688 --> 18:51.023
Now that I know there was
a smallpox epidemic in Winthrop,

18:51.025 --> 18:53.124
I need to find out more
about it.

18:53.126 --> 18:55.293
I'm heading over
to meet with a local historian.

18:55.295 --> 18:56.964
He says
there's a direct connection

18:56.966 --> 18:59.433
between the outbreak and
the property I'm investigating.

19:11.007 --> 19:13.474
So, Bob, I understand that
there was a smallpox epidemic

19:13.476 --> 19:15.408
related to the property
I'm investigating.

19:15.410 --> 19:16.407
Correct.

19:16.409 --> 19:17.975
When did it happen?

19:17.977 --> 19:20.010
December of 1751.

19:20.012 --> 19:22.145
So, how does this epidemic
start?

19:22.147 --> 19:25.086
The ship <i> The Bumper</i>
came into town

19:25.088 --> 19:26.922
and ran aground
here in Winthrop.

19:26.924 --> 19:29.356
Captain Nicholas Cousens,

19:29.358 --> 19:32.159
actually, he had a crew member
that was sick.

19:32.161 --> 19:35.066
And he quarantined him on ship
prior to this crash.

19:35.068 --> 19:37.637
He ordered everybody
off the ship.

19:37.639 --> 19:40.372
And then he just basically
got townspeople

19:40.374 --> 19:42.703
to help out him
unloading his ship.

19:42.705 --> 19:43.838
So, that's how
it winds up spreading?

19:43.840 --> 19:44.907
Correct.

19:44.909 --> 19:46.611
That's a scumbag move.
It is.

19:46.613 --> 19:48.582
Over 7,500 people got infected.

19:48.584 --> 19:50.784
569 people died.

19:50.786 --> 19:52.552
Wow.

19:52.554 --> 19:55.457
Considering the time it was
and the amount of people,

19:55.459 --> 19:56.826
that's a lot of people.

19:56.828 --> 19:58.696
A lot of people,
especially around this area.

19:58.698 --> 20:01.030
I mean, back then,
they were mainly farmers.

20:01.032 --> 20:03.565
What do you know about
the symptoms of smallpox?

20:03.567 --> 20:06.304
Well, you have a high fever,
body ache,

20:06.306 --> 20:07.906
have open sores,
and stuff like that.

20:07.908 --> 20:09.440
And if you'll look
at this picture,

20:09.442 --> 20:10.907
you can see how painful
it can be.

20:10.909 --> 20:12.442
This is what a guy
would look like?

20:12.444 --> 20:13.910
That's what it looks like.
Oh, geez.

20:13.912 --> 20:14.911
Yeah.

20:14.913 --> 20:16.577
So, Bob, you mentioned
on the phone

20:16.579 --> 20:17.978
there was a direct connection

20:17.980 --> 20:20.379
between the epidemic and
the property I'm investigating.

20:20.381 --> 20:22.080
Right.
Because a lot of the patients

20:22.082 --> 20:24.780
were actually taken
to John Bill's house,

20:24.782 --> 20:26.182
the owner of that property.

20:26.184 --> 20:28.319
That took a lot of guts
for this guy to do that.

20:28.321 --> 20:29.820
A lot of guts, yep.

20:34.322 --> 20:41.521
I see all of these men
running up from over here.

20:44.458 --> 20:47.094
They're all dying.

20:47.096 --> 20:49.998
And they're all scared.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.302
They're all white men.

20:52.304 --> 20:55.841
There is so much pain.

20:58.544 --> 21:04.585
All these dead --
these dead souls, these men.

21:04.587 --> 21:06.922
There's so much sadness here.

21:24.317 --> 21:26.988
I'm at the local library
to see what else I can uncover

21:26.990 --> 21:28.793
about my client's property.

21:28.795 --> 21:30.961
Digging through old records,

21:30.963 --> 21:35.367
I find a young woman named
Suzanna Geary who died in 1905.

21:35.369 --> 21:40.273
But what's really disturbing is
where her body was discovered --

21:40.275 --> 21:43.776
washed up onshore
right by Cynthia's house.

21:44.786 --> 21:46.947
I'm heading over to meet with
a local police lieutenant

21:46.949 --> 21:49.084
who I asked
to look into it for me.

21:49.086 --> 21:52.654
He says this story
is every parents' nightmare.

21:57.156 --> 22:00.853
Lieutenant, came across
this gruesome case back in 1905.

22:01.888 --> 22:03.122
Body washed up on the shore

22:03.124 --> 22:04.824
pretty close to the property
I'm investigating.

22:04.826 --> 22:06.059
What do you know about it?

22:06.061 --> 22:07.260
Suzanna Geary --

22:07.262 --> 22:09.161
20-year-old dancer
originally from Massachusetts

22:09.163 --> 22:10.962
working in a performance
in Boston.

22:10.964 --> 22:13.401
This is a picture of her
right here

22:13.403 --> 22:16.504
taken from a newspaper
back in 1905.

22:16.506 --> 22:18.638
She's a pretty girl.
Yeah, pretty girl.

22:18.640 --> 22:21.642
She was going out with one of the stage
managers of her production company.

22:21.644 --> 22:22.977
Okay.

22:22.979 --> 22:24.780
She became pregnant,
wasn't married...

22:24.782 --> 22:25.947
Ah.

22:25.949 --> 22:27.629
...and things started to go bad
from there.

22:31.054 --> 22:34.657
I know that this woman
is younger,

22:34.659 --> 22:38.559
probably in her teen or 20s.

22:38.561 --> 22:42.264
She has long hair about here,
brown.

22:42.266 --> 22:46.134
She'd kind of skinny
for a pregnant woman.

22:48.173 --> 22:51.177
The young girl who jumped me
at the start of my walk

22:51.179 --> 22:52.545
has left my body.

22:52.547 --> 22:55.317
And I'm now able to see
what she looked like in life.

22:55.319 --> 22:57.987
I'm surprised to find
that she's pregnant.

22:57.989 --> 23:01.422
Very pretty, large, brown eyes.

23:01.424 --> 23:02.790
Very dark.

23:02.792 --> 23:04.323
Um...

23:04.325 --> 23:06.091
and obviously very sad.

23:09.063 --> 23:11.467
So, what happens next?

23:11.469 --> 23:13.670
Suzanna and her boyfriend,
Nathan --

23:13.672 --> 23:15.874
here's a sketch of him
right here...

23:17.110 --> 23:18.644
...they decide
that having this baby

23:18.646 --> 23:21.111
isn't going to be the best for
either of them in their careers.

23:21.113 --> 23:23.710
And they decide
to go have an illegal abortion.

23:23.712 --> 23:25.548
They find a doctor
in the Boston area.

23:25.550 --> 23:26.917
Okay.
That doesn't go so well

23:26.919 --> 23:29.553
because she develop
septicemia and peritonitis,

23:29.555 --> 23:31.422
two highly infectious diseases.

23:31.424 --> 23:33.892
They're serious today,
never mind back then.

23:33.894 --> 23:35.629
I've heard of it.
But what are the symptoms?

23:35.631 --> 23:37.731
You have any idea?
Well, I know that a sepsis infection

23:37.733 --> 23:38.798
is in your bloodstream,

23:38.800 --> 23:40.765
and it can travel
throughout your body.

23:40.767 --> 23:43.632
Causes excruciating pain.
It's a deadly disease.

23:43.634 --> 23:45.800
Okay. So, now,
she develop this infection.

23:45.802 --> 23:47.601
And I assume
she goes back to the doctor?

23:47.603 --> 23:48.803
That is correct.

23:48.805 --> 23:50.005
A second procedure is performed

23:50.006 --> 23:51.672
by this doctor, Percy McLeod.

23:51.674 --> 23:54.242
But they go back
to the same office?

23:54.244 --> 23:56.477
Yes.
But this is a new doctor that sees her?

23:56.479 --> 23:58.745
We don't know exactly who
performed the first procedure.

23:58.747 --> 24:00.247
It could have been
Dr. McLeod.

24:00.249 --> 24:02.683
He was trying to fix whatever went
wrong with the first procedure.

24:02.685 --> 24:05.585
And instead of fixing it,
she dies a day later.

24:12.026 --> 24:14.428
She was pregnant...

24:14.430 --> 24:16.797
and she lost the baby.

24:16.799 --> 24:19.362
And I think she lost her man.

24:19.364 --> 24:22.800
Something is so physically wrong
with her.

24:22.802 --> 24:26.638
This woman's physical and
emotional trauma is so severe

24:26.640 --> 24:29.576
that I'm experiencing
all of the pain she felt

24:29.578 --> 24:31.340
when she was alive.

24:31.342 --> 24:38.347
I've never felt so much pain.

24:38.349 --> 24:40.414
It hurt.

24:40.416 --> 24:42.884
It was so painful.

24:42.886 --> 24:47.019
Seriously, I would've [bleep]
just shot myself in the head.

24:48.592 --> 24:53.126
Her loss is just...

24:54.894 --> 24:57.393
Oh, it's really bad.

25:00.097 --> 25:03.362
So, how do we end up with her
going DOA in a doctor's office

25:03.364 --> 25:04.629
to being in the water?

25:04.631 --> 25:06.098
I'm sure that the doctors,

25:06.100 --> 25:08.268
realizing that they had
a dead body on their hands,

25:08.270 --> 25:11.901
panicked and started to
try to cover up their tracks,

25:11.903 --> 25:13.234
try to dispose of the body

25:13.236 --> 25:15.367
so that no finger-pointing
would be made

25:15.369 --> 25:17.935
that they were doing
any kind of illegal activity.

25:17.937 --> 25:19.969
These two gentlemen here --

25:19.971 --> 25:23.272
hired by the doctor
to dispose of the body.

25:23.274 --> 25:26.374
The body was chopped up,
went into suitcases,

25:26.376 --> 25:29.075
and thrown into the harbor.

25:29.077 --> 25:31.846
So, what happens next?

25:31.848 --> 25:35.349
Two young boys in a rowboat
saw the bag floating,

25:35.351 --> 25:37.016
decided to bring it in.

25:37.018 --> 25:38.950
God knows what's inside of it.

25:38.952 --> 25:41.419
They bring it to shore,
they open it up,

25:41.421 --> 25:44.256
and wrapped up inside
was a torso.

25:44.258 --> 25:46.557
What did they do with the torso
at this point?

25:46.559 --> 25:48.091
Well, it's right next to
the cemetery.

25:48.093 --> 25:49.459
They bring it in
to the cemetery.

25:49.461 --> 25:51.463
And that's right next to
the house I'm investigating.

25:51.465 --> 25:52.799
Exactly.

25:52.801 --> 25:55.004
Somehow, the mother
identifies it as her daughter.

25:55.006 --> 25:56.673
So now we have a victim.

25:56.675 --> 25:59.411
We found an article,
actually, of divers

25:59.413 --> 26:00.779
looking for other evidence.

26:00.781 --> 26:02.883
And that's when they
discovered her head.

26:02.885 --> 26:05.651
Oh, wow.
Look at this.

26:05.653 --> 26:08.190
So, now, what winded up
happening with the doctor?

26:08.192 --> 26:10.494
Did he ever get convicted
or charged?

26:10.496 --> 26:12.827
The people that helped the
doctor, they were convicted.

26:12.829 --> 26:14.528
They were sent to
the Charlestown penitentiary

26:14.530 --> 26:15.597
for seven years.

26:15.599 --> 26:18.766
The doctor in this case,
he was charged,

26:18.768 --> 26:20.433
but he was acquitted.

26:29.040 --> 26:32.442
During my walk, a traumatized
young woman jumped my body.

26:32.444 --> 26:34.343
I'm meeting with a sketch artist

26:34.345 --> 26:37.045
to describe
how she appeared in life.

26:37.047 --> 26:39.880
She was on the thin side.

26:41.518 --> 26:46.152
Deep-brown colored eyes,
very large.

26:48.053 --> 26:50.455
Very pointy chin.

26:54.957 --> 26:57.424
Yes, that's who I saw.

27:20.362 --> 27:23.200
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

27:23.202 --> 27:25.082
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

27:25.102 --> 27:28.040
and our clients
for the first time.

27:28.042 --> 27:30.343
Amy, I want you to meet
Nicholas and Cynthia.

27:30.468 --> 27:31.801
This is their home.

27:31.803 --> 27:33.538
They've both experienced
a lot of things here.

27:33.540 --> 27:35.941
But the main reason
they called us

27:35.943 --> 27:39.310
and their main concern is their
14-year-old son, Nathaniel.

27:39.312 --> 27:40.310
Okay.

27:40.312 --> 27:42.144
He has special needs,

27:42.146 --> 27:45.477
and it seems like
he's being singled out

27:45.479 --> 27:47.012
and victimized
in a violent manner.

27:47.014 --> 27:49.115
What they want to know from us

27:49.117 --> 27:51.749
is if it's safe enough
to stay here.

27:51.751 --> 27:53.151
With that, I'm going to ask her

27:53.153 --> 27:55.318
to tell us
about how her walk went.

27:57.456 --> 28:06.162
On my way to do the walk,
I was jumped by a female.

28:06.164 --> 28:10.598
And I became violently ill.

28:10.600 --> 28:13.233
It was extremely sudden,
totally unexpected,

28:13.235 --> 28:16.304
and extremely overwhelming.

28:16.306 --> 28:20.007
She felt so much loneliness.

28:31.455 --> 28:33.254
Okay.

28:36.591 --> 28:39.025
Getting jumped is
not easy for her.

28:41.095 --> 28:42.528
I hate when it happens.

28:42.530 --> 28:43.696
Hmm.

28:43.698 --> 28:49.374
I can't even imagine
living with that kind of pain.

28:49.376 --> 28:52.877
If I had been her,

28:52.879 --> 28:55.160
I would have just taken a gun
and shot myself in the head.

28:57.683 --> 29:01.822
The thing is is that
she doesn't mean to jump people.

29:01.824 --> 29:07.161
But when she does, the people
can become violently ill,

29:07.163 --> 29:11.704
extremely depressed,
possibly suicidal.

29:11.706 --> 29:14.306
One of the things
you told me about your son

29:14.308 --> 29:16.175
was how his personality changed.

29:16.177 --> 29:19.075
Well, really shortly
after we moved in,

29:19.077 --> 29:20.210
he just really changed.

29:20.212 --> 29:23.247
I used to call him
the little mayor.

29:23.249 --> 29:24.546
Talked to everyone.

29:24.548 --> 29:26.714
Now, he doesn't want to
really go out

29:26.716 --> 29:28.482
and do things with other kids

29:28.484 --> 29:31.618
or enjoy school activities
like he used to.

29:33.420 --> 29:37.021
Were you able
to find anything else about her?

29:37.023 --> 29:41.055
Well, she's probably between
16 and 22, I would say.

29:41.057 --> 29:44.154
Very little, thin, pale.

29:44.156 --> 29:48.190
She had very long brown hair
and huge brown eyes.

29:48.192 --> 29:52.590
And what I figured out
was that sense of loss

29:52.592 --> 29:56.028
was because
she had been pregnant

29:56.030 --> 29:59.896
and lost her child.

30:02.331 --> 30:04.534
A lot of it's making sense.

30:06.771 --> 30:09.269
It's not a story
you're going to want to hear.

30:09.271 --> 30:12.574
So, a young dancer
by the name of Suzanna Geary.

30:12.576 --> 30:14.076
She was 20 years old.

30:14.078 --> 30:16.478
She was from Boston.

30:16.480 --> 30:18.615
Her boyfriend,
who was the stage manager

30:18.617 --> 30:21.253
for the dancing troupe
she was in got her pregnant.

30:21.255 --> 30:22.856
Uh-oh.

30:22.858 --> 30:25.057
And they decided to
get an abortion,

30:25.059 --> 30:27.523
which obviously was illegal
back then.

30:27.525 --> 30:29.525
And there's a sketch
of her boyfriend.

30:29.527 --> 30:32.797
This is Morris Nathan.

30:32.799 --> 30:35.598
Now, while she's recovering,

30:35.600 --> 30:38.869
she develop
what they call septicemia.

30:38.871 --> 30:44.174
She got very sick,
excruciating pain, apparently.

30:44.176 --> 30:47.811
So, she goes back
to Dr. Percy McLeod.

30:50.116 --> 30:51.681
They do another procedure.

30:51.683 --> 30:53.316
Didn't go too well.

30:53.318 --> 30:54.618
She dies the next day.

30:54.620 --> 30:58.186
Now, the police at the time
believed he panicked.

30:58.188 --> 31:01.121
He cuts her up...

31:01.123 --> 31:03.058
dismembers her body,

31:03.060 --> 31:05.862
then hires two guys to take
the body and get rid of it --

31:05.864 --> 31:07.730
throws it into the harbor.

31:07.732 --> 31:08.730
God.

31:08.732 --> 31:10.930
A few days later,

31:10.932 --> 31:14.698
her body washes up
very close to the house.

31:17.903 --> 31:20.940
Now, I've got a picture of her.

31:20.942 --> 31:23.910
And she's a pretty girl, too.

31:25.710 --> 31:27.511
Oh, my God.

31:29.114 --> 31:31.214
Well, I did do a sketch of her.

31:33.311 --> 31:34.951
And this is the same girl
that jumped you?

31:34.953 --> 31:35.951
Yes.

31:43.965 --> 31:46.399
You take a look at that.

31:52.173 --> 31:55.209
Without question, that's her.

31:55.211 --> 31:57.243
Wow.

31:57.245 --> 32:00.848
The eyes, the eyes.

32:00.850 --> 32:03.852
Mm-hmm.

32:03.854 --> 32:04.954
That's horrible.

32:04.956 --> 32:09.861
I mean, I can't even
put words to that.

32:15.566 --> 32:17.736
What else did you see
on your walk?

32:17.738 --> 32:19.903
So, I came into the house,

32:19.905 --> 32:24.777
and in the kitchen,
I see this elderly woman.

32:26.614 --> 32:31.717
And she is filled with
resentment, hatred, bitterness.

32:31.719 --> 32:36.590
She was very cold and distant
in life.

32:36.592 --> 32:38.426
One of the things
that she expressed

32:38.428 --> 32:41.896
was that she absolutely
disdains humanity

32:41.898 --> 32:45.898
and that when she was alive
she had repressed that.

32:45.900 --> 32:50.471
She told me that she lived here,
I think, in the '50s,

32:50.473 --> 32:53.940
that she was a housewife.

32:53.942 --> 32:58.348
You mentioned your mom wasn't
always that great, that nice.

33:00.450 --> 33:04.554
Yeah, my mother kind of
didn't like a lot of people.

33:04.556 --> 33:06.723
She kind of ruled the roost
a lot.

33:06.725 --> 33:09.424
She didn't like anybody.

33:09.426 --> 33:10.893
I'm trying to be gracious.

33:10.895 --> 33:13.930
She actually said that she loved
the dog better than my children.

33:13.932 --> 33:15.399
Really?

33:16.736 --> 33:19.671
You said you got a good look?

33:19.673 --> 33:21.940
Mm-hmm.

33:27.613 --> 33:29.413
Wow.

33:30.248 --> 33:32.652
Is that who you saw?

33:32.654 --> 33:35.055
Yeah.
That looks like her.

33:36.123 --> 33:37.889
But definitely older.

33:40.227 --> 33:42.762
She didn't want you to
have the house, either.

33:42.764 --> 33:44.230
No, mnh-mnh.

33:44.232 --> 33:47.297
When she found out the house
was sold and the papers passed,

33:47.299 --> 33:51.271
she just was really upset
and left me a voicemail.

33:51.273 --> 33:54.005
She said
I stole the effing house.

33:54.007 --> 33:57.644
And she doesn't give an "f"
what I think.

33:57.646 --> 34:00.745
And "f" me,
and "f" everyone else.

34:00.747 --> 34:02.945
And use your imagination.

34:04.147 --> 34:05.748
Well, all I know is

34:05.750 --> 34:09.452
that the woman I met
repressed a lot of stuff,

34:09.454 --> 34:12.887
like did not really
give a [bleep] about anybody.

34:12.889 --> 34:14.056
Mm-hmm.

34:14.058 --> 34:15.290
Sounds right.

34:15.292 --> 34:17.960
What is she doing
around the house?

34:17.962 --> 34:19.661
Nothing good.

34:20.795 --> 34:24.364
She wants to scare people.

34:24.366 --> 34:28.335
She had made herself
about seven to eight feet tall.

34:28.338 --> 34:30.768
Like, she was showing me

34:30.770 --> 34:34.505
this monstrous, disgusting,
deformed thing.

34:34.507 --> 34:39.674
And that helps her to frighten
and cause fear and all of that.

34:39.676 --> 34:43.681
I know she can get physical
in the house to people.

34:43.684 --> 34:46.152
Like,
upstairs in the master bedroom,

34:46.154 --> 34:48.217
I saw her
coming through the wall.

34:48.219 --> 34:51.154
And she'll, like,
slink down onto the floor

34:51.156 --> 34:52.924
and then come up the bed

34:52.926 --> 34:56.163
and, like, attempt to strangle

34:56.165 --> 34:58.231
the female
that sleeps in the bed.

35:00.968 --> 35:04.370
The other thing
that she tries to do is,

35:04.372 --> 35:08.544
she likes to enter nightmares
and create them.

35:08.546 --> 35:13.380
And what she'll do
is get in there

35:13.382 --> 35:15.250
and literally make the people

35:15.252 --> 35:16.985
feel like
they're being chased by her.

35:16.987 --> 35:19.418
Now, you guys
are sleeping in there,

35:19.420 --> 35:21.383
and you're having nightmares
every frigging night.

35:21.385 --> 35:23.085
Yeah.

35:23.087 --> 35:25.690
I've had nightmares,
vivid nightmares.

35:25.692 --> 35:28.357
It's always something violent.

35:28.359 --> 35:32.693
Last night, I had one
of a parachute jump go wrong.

35:32.695 --> 35:35.996
There was also
boating accidents,

35:35.998 --> 35:37.694
just horrible things like that.

35:37.696 --> 35:41.498
Now, you mentioned that
it can get physical.

35:41.500 --> 35:45.203
This is a picture of Nathaniel.

35:45.205 --> 35:46.736
Oh, okay.

35:46.738 --> 35:50.042
And he's been woken up
with scratches on him.

35:50.044 --> 35:51.976
Wow.

35:53.278 --> 35:55.747
It's happened a few times.

35:55.749 --> 35:58.284
Another time, I put him to bed,

35:58.286 --> 36:01.985
and he woke up in the morning,
and he had a long 8-inch scratch

36:01.987 --> 36:04.220
right from the groin area
all the way down.

36:05.857 --> 36:08.757
Is she capable of doing this
on Nathaniel like that?

36:08.759 --> 36:11.994
Very possible.

36:11.996 --> 36:14.062
Very.

36:14.064 --> 36:17.166
Because what she's doing now
is just inflicting pain,

36:17.168 --> 36:20.302
like, whether it's mentally,
emotionally, physically.

36:20.304 --> 36:23.237
And now, she definitely
has her sights set

36:23.239 --> 36:25.774
on two individuals
in the house.

36:25.776 --> 36:28.245
One was the young boy.

36:28.247 --> 36:31.347
And the other
is the lady of the house.

36:33.650 --> 36:35.785
You're the only lady
in the house.

36:35.787 --> 36:36.986
Mm-hmm.

36:36.988 --> 36:38.287
Oh, boy.

36:41.257 --> 36:43.391
What I got was that, you know,

36:43.393 --> 36:45.559
she's trying to, like, you know,
really strangle you,

36:45.561 --> 36:46.826
like, to death...

36:49.530 --> 36:54.601
...and that she wants to get you
and then go after him.

36:56.069 --> 36:58.472
I definitely got the sense

36:58.474 --> 37:00.275
that she would go after him
big-time, too.

37:00.277 --> 37:02.875
I feel sick right now.

37:24.666 --> 37:26.183
She's trying to, like,
you know,

37:26.303 --> 37:29.303
really strangle you,
like, to death.

37:32.791 --> 37:36.130
And she wants to get you
and then go after him.

37:39.103 --> 37:42.001
I feel sick right now.

37:51.450 --> 37:52.951
You don't look surprised.

37:52.953 --> 37:54.319
No.

37:54.321 --> 37:56.254
I know the whole family,

37:56.256 --> 37:59.022
and I saw what she did
to, basically, all of them.

38:08.868 --> 38:10.569
You okay?

38:10.571 --> 38:12.171
Yeah.

38:12.173 --> 38:15.841
This is probably one of the
hardest reveals I've ever done.

38:18.410 --> 38:20.443
Did you feel abused
when you were a kid?

38:20.445 --> 38:23.479
Oh, yeah. Absolutely.
Oh, absolutely.

38:25.249 --> 38:28.181
I'm just surprised
with Nathaniel.

38:29.883 --> 38:31.284
She was always like that.

38:31.286 --> 38:32.955
I mean,
does she really feel like

38:32.957 --> 38:35.293
you guys just ruined her life,
or what?

38:35.295 --> 38:38.163
Oh, yeah.
She had a hot temper, for sure.

38:41.334 --> 38:44.036
Well, I know this isn't
what you wanted to hear.

38:44.038 --> 38:47.642
I know it's something
I didn't want to hear, either.

38:47.644 --> 38:49.578
The big question left is,

38:49.580 --> 38:52.112
is it safe for you
to raise Nathaniel in the house?

38:53.848 --> 38:56.382
For that, I'm going to
turn it over to Amy.

38:57.950 --> 39:00.052
What you need to deal with

39:00.054 --> 39:04.022
is getting rid of
unwanted visitors, so to speak.

39:05.759 --> 39:11.067
So, therefore, we kind of
want to put her to rest

39:11.069 --> 39:13.068
so that you're not going to
have to deal with her.

39:13.070 --> 39:16.838
Because my fear is that if
you don't take care of her now,

39:16.840 --> 39:19.745
it's going to get worse.

39:19.747 --> 39:21.880
It could be so debilitating,

39:21.882 --> 39:25.351
I don't know
if you could get her out.

39:27.121 --> 39:29.655
My suggestion is

39:29.657 --> 39:32.761
to get an individual
that is a mental medium.

39:32.763 --> 39:37.030
A mental medium
is a type of medium

39:37.032 --> 39:42.534
that does not feel
the individual's death.

39:42.536 --> 39:48.169
Therefore, they won't be
as impacted by her.

39:48.171 --> 39:50.504
So, what is this mental medium
going to do?

39:50.506 --> 39:55.007
I would suggest
that they go in your backyard,

39:55.009 --> 39:58.340
talk to her over two days.

39:58.342 --> 40:01.478
What they're basically going to
be talking to her about

40:01.480 --> 40:05.985
is letting her
tell them her story

40:05.987 --> 40:09.352
to help her to move on.

40:09.354 --> 40:11.589
Will she leave at that point?

40:11.591 --> 40:13.091
Yes.

40:13.093 --> 40:16.459
So, it sounds like the biggest
problem here is your mom.

40:16.461 --> 40:18.593
Mm-hmm.

40:18.595 --> 40:21.801
As far as she's concerned,

40:21.803 --> 40:26.073
what I would suggest doing
is writing a letter to her.

40:26.075 --> 40:30.815
In this letter,
I would like you to focus

40:30.817 --> 40:33.619
on what she is no longer allowed
to do,

40:33.621 --> 40:36.222
that she is no longer allowed

40:36.224 --> 40:41.466
to control you, your home,
your family, or your dreams,

40:41.468 --> 40:46.773
that you are taking back
the power and control

40:46.775 --> 40:49.142
of your home and your family.

40:49.144 --> 40:52.145
And then,
have a physical medium,

40:52.147 --> 40:55.945
which is somebody like me,
come to the home.

40:55.947 --> 40:59.649
And you and this physical medium
are going to deal with her.

40:59.651 --> 41:04.051
Then, you're going to
read your letter.

41:04.053 --> 41:05.787
I want you to yell.
I do.

41:05.789 --> 41:08.388
I feel like you need to
fricking yell at her.

41:08.390 --> 41:11.657
Don't let her stop you.

41:11.659 --> 41:13.358
I don't care whether you feel
like you're going to throw up.

41:13.360 --> 41:14.659
I don't care
if you do throw up.

41:14.661 --> 41:17.997
I don't care what happens

41:17.999 --> 41:22.169
as long as you finish
what you write.

41:22.171 --> 41:24.406
Right.
Once you're done,

41:24.408 --> 41:29.510
then you tell that physical
medium, "Get rid of her."

41:32.915 --> 41:35.416
Are you afraid to do this?

41:36.685 --> 41:38.586
Uh, anxious.

41:38.588 --> 41:41.324
Once I get started,
I'll be on a roll.

41:42.427 --> 41:44.495
I see how protective you are
of him.

41:44.497 --> 41:46.129
Yes. I am very much.

41:46.131 --> 41:48.699
What about you? Are you
going to take Amy's advice?

41:48.701 --> 41:50.935
Yes, definitely.

41:50.937 --> 41:52.770
I look forward to it.

41:52.772 --> 41:55.640
Cynthia has her work
cut out for her.

41:55.642 --> 41:59.175
But I believe if she's able
to stand up to her mother,

41:59.177 --> 42:02.246
she'll free her family of
the evil that's tormenting them

42:02.248 --> 42:05.183
and they'll be able to
live a peaceful life.
