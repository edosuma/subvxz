to the conference finals.

At three-point shooting,
don't even--

00:10.644 --> 00:14.480
I bit my lip
at lunch today.

- Sucks.
Anyway, I just don't see it.

The nets are tough.
- Oh, the nets are super tough.

- Now I have this big bump
on my lip that hurts.

00:26.093 --> 00:28.327
I hate it.

They're always terrible.

to think about it

Whatever.
It's not a big deal.

If this is the worst thing
that's gonna happen--

- Oh, sorry. Pam.

it's been challenging.

Yesterday, things took
a turn for the worse.

It's a lot of pressure,

I signed up for, right?

I gotta hop off

break up with me?"

For 15 years,

And "four eyes" and "sci-fi
nerd" and "girl puncher,"

that got me through mine

of shepherd's pie and brandy.

not the drink.

begun to shame.

06:30.524 --> 06:32.791

if you leave now,

06:32.793 --> 06:33.959
Then you'll get it
in your car,

06:33.961 --> 06:34.993
And then you'll get it
in your house!

There's a pencil
poking in my rolls.

06:43.137 --> 06:45.670
- Maybe it was meredith.

06:45.672 --> 06:47.973
Maybe she brought in lice
that are totally different

06:47.975 --> 06:50.575
Than the lice that I got
from cece.

06:50.577 --> 06:52.744
So let's not jump
to the simplest conclusion

06:52.746 --> 06:54.780
That she got her lice
from me.

06:54.782 --> 06:59.751
That is how wars
get started.

it was me.

- No.

07:25.179 --> 07:28.680
Said he's rather meet you
at his private court.

07:28.682 --> 07:33.118
- You gotta be
kidding me.

07:33.120 --> 07:38.190
- Oh, my god.

07:38.192 --> 07:40.225

look like I'm doing?

You know, I think these critters
migrated from down south.

07:49.102 --> 07:50.836
What were you saying?

07:50.838 --> 07:52.771
- Nothing.

07:52.773 --> 07:54.039
I'm going to tell her,

07:54.041 --> 07:56.842
But now is clearly
not the time.

07:56.844 --> 08:00.579
I will buy her a wig,
we'll have a few laughs.

08:00.581 --> 08:03.482
There's a right way
to do this.

- Scalp leeches,
skull vampires,

08:08.021 --> 08:11.022
Follicle gypsies,
hair lawyers.

08:11.024 --> 08:13.658
One thing is clear--
it's kill or be killed!

08:13.660 --> 08:15.660
- No, no, no. It's more
of a nuisance, really.

08:15.662 --> 08:17.162
It's not that big a deal.

08:17.164 --> 08:19.264
So I've collected
your hats and your coats...

08:19.266 --> 08:21.233
- To be burned!
- To be washed.

08:21.235 --> 08:22.934
- What do we do
about our heads?

08:22.936 --> 08:25.270
- I'm not gonna lie.
Lye!

08:25.272 --> 08:27.939
- No.
All we need is mayonnaise.

08:27.941 --> 08:30.642
- Excuse me?
- She's right. It works.

08:30.644 --> 08:31.943
I would imagine.

08:31.945 --> 08:34.913
- Yes. It helps to suffocate
the little buddies,

08:34.915 --> 08:36.648
And it's
a really healthy alternative

08:36.650 --> 08:39.017
To the chemicals found
in most lice shampoos.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.719
- I can appreciate that.

08:40.721 --> 08:45.290
I also only eat
local organic produce.

08:45.292 --> 08:47.893
- Sha-boom!
How do you like me now?

08:47.895 --> 08:49.961
- Oh!
- Wow!

08:49.963 --> 08:51.830
- Take a picture.
It'll last longer.

08:51.832 --> 08:53.765
- We don't want it
to last longer. It's horrible.

08:53.767 --> 08:55.967
- Bald people make me sick.
- Yeah, yeah.

08:55.969 --> 08:57.969
Everybody pile on meredith.

08:57.971 --> 08:59.137
But I'm the only one
with the balls

08:59.139 --> 09:02.974
To show them lice
who's boss.

09:02.976 --> 09:06.645
If everybody just follows
my instructions,

09:06.647 --> 09:08.079
Then nobody else
needs to end up bald.

09:08.081 --> 09:10.315
Not that it looks bad,
meredith.

09:10.317 --> 09:12.984
It looks--
it looks awesome.

09:12.986 --> 09:15.720
You look like a baby
who suddenly aged 50 years.

09:15.722 --> 09:18.924
A cute baby, but something
sucked the life force out of it.

09:18.926 --> 09:20.792
I'm so sorry.
We need mayonnaise.

09:20.794 --> 09:22.928
We need it now.
- Oh, uh, uh, I'll go.

09:22.930 --> 09:24.129
- Okay.
- Oh, thank you.

09:24.131 --> 09:25.330
- You're a saint, pam.

09:25.332 --> 09:27.999
Uh, meredith, could I get you
something special

09:28.001 --> 09:32.037
Candy or--or one
of those stylish turbans?

09:32.039 --> 09:33.104
- Thanks, pam.

09:33.106 --> 09:34.806
I'll take a pack
of nicorette gum

09:34.808 --> 09:35.807
And a pack of kools.

09:35.809 --> 09:38.643
- Okay.

09:40.613 --> 09:42.881
- Let's talk pubes,
people.

09:42.883 --> 09:47.719
- Hey, darryl.
- Oh, hey, val.

09:50.323 --> 09:53.224
- Darryl.
Oh, that was tragic.

09:53.226 --> 09:56.361
Oh, that was like a car crash.
I couldn't look away.

09:56.363 --> 09:59.264
You two still clearly have
feelings for each other.

09:59.266 --> 10:00.899
- Yeah.

10:00.901 --> 10:02.300
- What's gonna make you
feel better, big guy?

10:02.302 --> 10:04.035
- When I was a kid,

10:04.037 --> 10:05.637
My grandmother used to
make me chocolate cake

10:05.639 --> 10:07.672
When I wasn't feeling good.

10:07.674 --> 10:09.674
She's not around to do that
anymore.

10:09.676 --> 10:15.847
I just need a moment to myself,
just to clear my head.

10:15.849 --> 10:17.048
- Oh, poor darryl.

10:17.050 --> 10:18.984
I can't bear to see him
suffer like this.

10:18.986 --> 10:21.987
- I think he needs
some hugs

10:21.989 --> 10:24.723
And maybe
some chocolate cake.

10:24.725 --> 10:28.159
- Mmm. This won't help him.
It's a muffin, not cake.

10:28.161 --> 10:29.327
- Listen,
let's try and get darryl

10:29.329 --> 10:30.895
The one thing
in the world

10:30.897 --> 10:33.264
He clearly wants
and needs the most.

10:33.266 --> 10:37.168
- An escalade.
- Or what's her name.

10:37.170 --> 10:39.037
- Val.

10:39.039 --> 10:41.940
- Let's get darryl val.

10:41.942 --> 10:43.875
- I hope you don't mind me
bringing you out here.

10:43.877 --> 10:45.410
I can't get my knees
under a desk.

10:45.412 --> 10:46.811
- Are you kidding me?

10:46.813 --> 10:48.413
I could literally
scalp tickets to this.

10:48.415 --> 10:50.649
- Well, you think you could
sink one from deep?

10:50.651 --> 10:53.218
- Listen, I don't mean
to intimidate you,

10:53.220 --> 10:54.919
But I did play
a little high school ball.

10:54.921 --> 10:59.057
- Okay.

10:59.059 --> 11:02.661
Wow. Halpert's got game.
All right.

11:02.663 --> 11:05.330
[cell phone rings]
- oh, sorry. I'm so sorry.

11:05.332 --> 11:07.365
This is my wife.
Can I take this?

11:07.367 --> 11:09.334
- If it's your wife,
you better take it.

11:09.336 --> 11:12.237
- Right?
[laughs]

11:12.239 --> 11:15.040
Hey, what's up?
Everything okay?

11:15.042 --> 11:16.708
- Oh, no.
Everything's great.

11:16.710 --> 11:19.411
Um, I was just calling to see,
uh, how the meeting went.

11:19.413 --> 11:21.913
- Oh, it's still happening
right now, actually, so--

11:21.915 --> 11:23.882
- He's, uh, really making you
work for it, huh?

11:23.884 --> 11:27.952
- Yes, it is very stressful.
Are you sure everything's okay?

11:27.954 --> 11:30.455
- Great.
I am killing it over here.

11:30.457 --> 11:33.024
[splat]

11:33.026 --> 11:35.293
Jim, I gotta go.
- Okay, bye.

11:35.295 --> 11:38.029
So sorry about that.
- Oh, no problem.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.464
Hey, jim, what size
do you wear, man?

11:39.466 --> 11:42.167
I got a pair of japanese nikes
with your name on 'em.

11:42.169 --> 11:45.704
What do you think?
- I love it.

11:45.706 --> 11:47.005
- Once it's all over
your head,

11:47.007 --> 11:51.176
That will be enough time
for the lice to fall asleep,

11:51.178 --> 11:53.378
Suffocate,
and then pass away.

11:53.380 --> 11:55.080
- Oh, sure.

11:55.082 --> 11:57.215
And when you're ready
to get serious,

11:57.217 --> 12:00.985
Come to me
to get it done right.

12:00.987 --> 12:04.756
- Put those away
before you hurt yourself.

12:04.758 --> 12:05.757
[fabric rips]

12:05.759 --> 12:08.426
- [gasps]
- oh, god. Oh, no.

12:08.428 --> 12:12.430
No. No!

12:12.432 --> 12:15.967
No! No! No!

12:15.969 --> 12:19.137
No! No!

12:19.139 --> 12:21.039
- Okay, it's easier
with a buddy,

12:21.041 --> 12:22.741
So everybody pair up.

12:22.743 --> 12:25.043
- Oscar, you want to be
my partner?

12:25.045 --> 12:28.279
- Yeah. Yeah, sure.
I'd love to.

12:28.281 --> 12:31.049
- Hey, uh, mayo buddy,
$5 tip,

12:31.051 --> 12:33.251
You unclog my ears, okay?

12:33.253 --> 12:35.353
- Oh, creed,
I'm so sorry.

12:35.355 --> 12:37.956
I'm--I'm already partners
with pete. Right, pete?

12:37.958 --> 12:39.190
- Uh, yeah.

12:39.192 --> 12:41.326
We promised each other
if we ever got lice,

12:41.328 --> 12:44.929
We'd buddy up,
so, sorry, man.

12:44.931 --> 12:48.967
- Hey, creed.
Want to be my buddy?

12:48.969 --> 12:52.036
- Oh, god.
Stuck with the weirdo.

12:52.038 --> 12:56.908
- [sighs]

12:56.910 --> 12:57.909
[hard slaps]

12:57.911 --> 12:58.977
- Angela.

12:58.979 --> 13:01.146
- You don't want bugs,
you know?

13:01.148 --> 13:05.016
Who knows where those bugs
will end up.

13:05.018 --> 13:07.552
- You're getting a bargain.
I ain't got no hair no more.

13:07.554 --> 13:10.054
- [sighs]

13:10.056 --> 13:14.926
- Creed, I'm all done.
My turn.

13:14.928 --> 13:18.096
- I'm sorry, pam.
It looks a little messy.

13:18.098 --> 13:20.064
- Well, wait.

13:23.169 --> 13:25.970
- How's that?
- I feel it working.

13:25.972 --> 13:28.039
[both grunt]

13:28.041 --> 13:29.974
- Ksk, ksk, ksk, ksk, ksk.

13:29.976 --> 13:32.310
- Eiffel tower.
- Oh! [laughs]

13:32.312 --> 13:34.479
- Now.

13:34.481 --> 13:36.014
- Can I help you?

13:36.016 --> 13:37.348
- Well--
- um--

13:37.350 --> 13:38.883
- We don't want to pry,

13:38.885 --> 13:40.552
But we heard you broke up
with darryl.

13:40.554 --> 13:41.986
- Yeah, that's true.

13:41.988 --> 13:43.822
- We think you made
a big, big mistake.

13:43.824 --> 13:46.024
- Big mistake.
- Quite enormous.

13:46.026 --> 13:49.327
- He's a real catch,
and you should take him back.

13:49.329 --> 13:52.363
- Okay. Thank you.
Is that all?

13:52.365 --> 13:54.465
- No.
No, that is not all.

13:54.467 --> 13:56.968
Let me tell you
what real life is like.

13:56.970 --> 13:59.070
The men dry up,
and the nights get lonely.

13:59.072 --> 14:00.939
The only calls
on your machine

14:00.941 --> 14:02.073
Are from collection agencies

14:02.075 --> 14:03.341
About that pair
of motorcycle boots

14:03.343 --> 14:07.912
You stalk your old
high school boyfriend online,

14:07.914 --> 14:10.381
Go to his daughter's
soccer games, and make a scene.

14:10.383 --> 14:12.483
You buy a diamond ring
for yourself,

14:12.485 --> 14:13.952
Wear it
on your right hand,

14:13.954 --> 14:16.120
And tell yourself
you're all you need.

14:16.122 --> 14:19.490
One day,
you're alone, tired.

14:19.492 --> 14:21.559
At your feet,
a dying bird.

14:21.561 --> 14:23.261
But where
did it come from?

14:23.263 --> 14:25.063
Why did you kill it?

14:25.065 --> 14:26.931
It is because,
in some strange way,

14:26.933 --> 14:28.466
It is you?

14:28.468 --> 14:30.401
- Thank you all
for your concern,

14:30.403 --> 14:33.004
But I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave, okay?

14:33.006 --> 14:36.507
- Pfft! Well.
- Thank you.

14:36.509 --> 14:38.877
Thank you.

14:38.879 --> 14:41.145
- So does this mean
you're gonna take darryl back?

14:41.147 --> 14:42.947
- No.

14:42.949 --> 14:44.048
- Well, then,
what would you say

14:44.050 --> 14:47.285
To you and me
hitting the town?

14:47.287 --> 14:51.122
'cause I'm free,
literally, forever.

14:51.124 --> 14:53.224
- Yeah,
kevin asked me out.

14:53.226 --> 14:55.460
I was kind of feeling good about
re-entering the dating pool,

14:55.462 --> 14:57.629
And then kevin
asked me out.

14:57.631 --> 15:01.032
Thought I might trade up
to a new level of man.

15:01.034 --> 15:06.070
Then kevin asked me out.

15:10.509 --> 15:12.243
[phone rings]

15:12.245 --> 15:15.013
[mayonnaise splats]

15:15.015 --> 15:16.948
- Hello?
- Hi, honey, it's mom.

15:16.950 --> 15:18.549
Look, cece's school
just called.

15:18.551 --> 15:22.086
She still has lice.
- What? No, that can't--

15:22.088 --> 15:23.421
I don't--
- now, don't worry, don't worry.

15:23.423 --> 15:25.056
I'm on my way
to pick her up,

15:25.058 --> 15:26.457
But you might
have lice too.

15:26.459 --> 15:27.659
You know,
lice can be tricky.

15:27.661 --> 15:30.028
Sometimes lice, like...
[phone clatters]

15:30.030 --> 15:32.563
- Oh, my god.
- Shave her head.

15:32.565 --> 15:36.100
Shave her head!

15:39.071 --> 15:40.338
[overlapping arguing]

15:40.340 --> 15:44.042
It's just been so chaotic
with jim gone that I--

15:44.044 --> 15:45.410
- Yeah, yeah,
princess fancy-pants

15:45.412 --> 15:47.645
Letting jane 12-pack over here
take the fall!

15:47.647 --> 15:49.514
- [amplified]
she's right, pam.

15:49.516 --> 15:51.382
- Is there a volume knob
on that thing?

15:51.384 --> 15:54.485
- Yes, there's a volume knob
on that thing!

15:54.487 --> 15:59.958
- Meredith,
I am so sorry.

15:59.960 --> 16:02.393
- Well, a lot of good your
sorrys are doing her now, pam.

16:02.395 --> 16:05.997
She's a monster.

16:05.999 --> 16:08.633
- I meant to say something
earlier. I just--

16:08.635 --> 16:13.304
- Just? Just what?
Just forgot?

16:13.306 --> 16:16.207
Who's the one that didn't
bring lice into the office?

16:16.209 --> 16:18.142
Meredith.

16:18.144 --> 16:19.744
Sure, I gave everybody
pink-eye once,

16:19.746 --> 16:21.412
And my ex keyed
a few of their cars.

16:21.414 --> 16:25.016
And, yeah, I bmed
in the shredder on new year's,

16:25.018 --> 16:26.517
But I didn't bring
the lice in.

16:26.519 --> 16:29.721
That was all pam.

16:29.723 --> 16:32.023
- [amplified]
attention, people of the office,

16:32.025 --> 16:36.427
You have exactly 60 seconds
to evacuate the bullpen.

16:36.429 --> 16:39.597
At that time,
I will be tossing

16:39.599 --> 16:42.066
This powerful
insecticidal grenade,

16:42.068 --> 16:47.505
Which contains
piperonyl butoxide as well as--

16:50.410 --> 16:53.311

16:53.313 --> 16:57.215
Whoa. Hypertoxide has
a mild hallucinogenic effect,

16:57.217 --> 16:58.549
But I don't think
it's kicked in yet.

16:58.551 --> 17:00.718
I'm gonna count down
from ten.

17:10.397 --> 17:13.297
- Wow.
He got to purple.

17:15.300 --> 17:16.467
- Ow!

17:16.469 --> 17:19.037
- Sorry.

17:19.039 --> 17:22.507
- [chokes and sputters]
you're waterboarding me!

17:22.509 --> 17:26.310
- Oops.

17:33.619 --> 17:37.288
- No, this is fine.
We're allowed to do this.

17:37.290 --> 17:42.360
This is okay.

17:42.362 --> 17:44.195
- Okay, you're up.

17:44.197 --> 17:47.331
- Yeah, I'm actually kind of sad
to see this baby go.

17:47.333 --> 17:49.367
- You do kind of
look like elvis,

17:49.369 --> 17:54.572
But we should probably wash
all the dead lice out.

17:57.242 --> 18:01.245
- Okay.
- Okay. Okay.

18:04.283 --> 18:05.683
Is that too cold?

- No. Actually,
it feels kind of nice.

over there.

I've been sitting here
the whole time.

18:22.802 --> 18:26.237

18:29.475 --> 18:31.175
- Okay.
- Huh?

18:31.177 --> 18:33.444
- Let's give it a shot.
Let's make it work.

18:33.446 --> 18:35.413
- Oh, no.
I mean, I want to.

18:35.415 --> 18:37.381
I just--I don't want
to force you into doing

18:37.383 --> 18:38.816
Something
you don't want to do.

18:38.818 --> 18:42.286
- You're not.
I believe in us.

18:42.288 --> 18:46.657
- But--

18:46.659 --> 18:50.361
I'm back together
with val.

18:50.363 --> 18:52.697
Yay.

18:56.503 --> 18:58.369
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

today.

18:59.572 --> 19:02.673
Not everything went exactly
according to plan,

19:02.675 --> 19:06.410
But, lice,
if you are watching,

19:06.412 --> 19:10.148
I am ready for you anytime,
anywhere.

erin already take off?

- I guess so.

- You're kareem,
coming to help.

19:27.567 --> 19:29.367

That makes total sense.

I'm kareem.
You're dr. J.

19:37.510 --> 19:38.943
- And that's all.
- That's it.

- No one will believe this
back home, but that's okay.

19:40.847 --> 19:42.413
[phone ringing]
let me show you how it's done.

19:42.415 --> 19:44.382

My mom's been watching
the kids all day.

how hard it was gonna be

I have to say, there are
not a lot of people

20:35.668 --> 20:38.569
Who could pull off a shaved
head, but you're rocking it.

20:38.571 --> 20:40.004
