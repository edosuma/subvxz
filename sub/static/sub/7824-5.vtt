We're dying of curiosity.

01:26.430 --> 01:28.240
Look, there's only
one thing worse

01:28.300 --> 01:29.470

01:29.540 --> 01:31.740
It's being one of those guys

how he became a loser.

01:34.470 --> 01:37.140

It comes in 72-ounce tubs here.

02:30.830 --> 02:33.370
I hope you'll space out
the tubs this year, Homer.

02:33.430 --> 02:34.600
What are you
getting at?

02:34.670 --> 02:36.470
Well, last year you got
a little rambunctious

02:36.540 --> 02:38.540
and mooned the poor umpire.

02:38.600 --> 02:41.430
Marge, this ticket
doesn't just give me a seat.

02:41.510 --> 02:43.440

03:48.470 --> 03:49.330
What's the matter, boy?

03:49.410 --> 03:50.710
He wouldn't sign my ball.

03:50.780 --> 03:52.950
Well, he's a fine role model.

03:53.010 --> 03:53.920

10:20.100 --> 10:21.800
I'm Antoine Tex Ohara.

10:21.870 --> 10:23.300
I own the Isotopes.

10:23.370 --> 10:25.910
Would you be interested
in becoming our official mascot?

10:25.970 --> 10:30.340
Me? A mascot
for a bush league team?

10:30.410 --> 10:32.110
<i>I should have slept on it</i>

10:32.180 --> 10:34.950
<i>or at least stared blankly
for a while.</i>

10:35.010 --> 10:37.170
<i>Perhaps if I had been unable
to think of a nickname</i>

10:37.250 --> 10:39.950
<i>all our lives
might have been spared.</i>

10:40.020 --> 10:41.520

<i>Get on the bus,
Dancin' Homer.</i>

10:41.590 --> 10:42.660
Will you shut up!

10:42.720 --> 10:44.130
I'm trying to think
of a name.

10:46.960 --> 10:49.700
Well, I'm ready
to punch in.

10:49.760 --> 10:52.470
Huh-ho..hey, cool, man.

10:52.530 --> 10:54.140
Our lives
have taken an odd turn.

10:54.200 --> 10:57.100
Did the team ask you
to dress like that, Homer?

10:57.170 --> 10:58.040
Nope.

10:58.100 --> 10:59.860
This was my own bright idea.

10:59.940 --> 11:02.010
Come on, we gotta hurry.
Don't fill up on those
vegetables, kids.

11:02.070 --> 11:03.830
Save room for your nachos.

people weren't laughing at me</i>

11:37.080 --> 11:38.810

11:38.880 --> 11:41.550

You wanted

12:49.110 --> 12:52.540
Homer, now we both knew
when you began doin' this

12:52.620 --> 12:53.350
you weren't gonna
be here forever.

12:53.420 --> 12:56.590
Oh, oh, oh, I get it.

12:56.650 --> 12:59.280
You can't fire the players,
so you fire the mascot.

12:59.360 --> 13:00.760
You make me sick.

13:00.830 --> 13:03.730
Homer, I'm not firing you.
I just got the word:

13:03.800 --> 13:05.730
You've been called up
to Capital City.

13:05.800 --> 13:07.300
Me? In the majors?

13:07.370 --> 13:08.670
That's right.

13:08.730 --> 13:10.790
Well wait a minute.
Capital City <i>has a mascot.</i>

13:10.870 --> 13:13.070
The greatest mascot
there is--

13:13.140 --> 13:15.180
the Capital City Goofball.

13:15.240 --> 13:18.410
Yeah, but he's gettin' on in
years and he needs someone to
fill in for

13:18.480 --> 13:20.650
a couple of innings a night.

13:20.710 --> 13:21.850
Could be a big opportunity
for ya'.

13:21.910 --> 13:23.040
I'll say.

13:23.110 --> 13:24.680
Why don't you talk it over
with your family?

13:24.750 --> 13:27.820
Because they
might say no.

13:27.890 --> 13:30.160
This was our biggest decision
the Simpsons ever faced.

13:30.220 --> 13:32.330
<i>I should have
listened to the kids</i>

13:32.390 --> 13:33.930
instead of my dumb wife.

13:33.990 --> 13:35.930
I shouldn't
have called her that.
Bite my tongue.

13:35.990 --> 13:37.590
Bite my tongue... ow!

13:37.660 --> 13:39.160
I can't leave Springfield.

13:39.230 --> 13:40.200
I was born here

13:40.270 --> 13:41.270
and I thought I would die here.

13:41.330 --> 13:43.160
It won't be so bad.

13:43.230 --> 13:44.800
You'll die some place else.

13:44.870 --> 13:47.580
What am I supposed
to do about friends?

13:47.640 --> 13:50.080
Pfft! You'll make new
and better friends.

13:50.140 --> 13:53.110
But, Dad, we're simple people
with simple values.

13:53.180 --> 13:55.980
Capital City is too big
and too complex.

13:56.050 --> 13:59.450
Everyone in Springfield knows us
and has forgiven us.

13:59.520 --> 14:00.850
Homer, I'd be lying

14:00.920 --> 14:03.590
if I didn't say that
this scares me a little.

14:03.660 --> 14:05.660
but we all
have a calling--

14:05.720 --> 14:07.950
a reason the almighty put us
on this Earth--

14:08.030 --> 14:10.360
and yours might be
to dance on dugouts.

14:10.430 --> 14:11.100
You mean..?

14:11.160 --> 14:12.590
Let's do it, Homer.

14:12.660 --> 14:14.120
Yeah, let's blow
this pop stand

14:14.200 --> 14:15.070
and never look back.

14:15.130 --> 14:15.960
Whatever doesn't
kill me

14:16.030 --> 14:17.460
can only make me
stronger.

14:19.500 --> 14:21.270
It's not that simple.
I've got to convince
my supervisor

14:21.340 --> 14:23.680
to give me
a leave of absence.

14:23.740 --> 14:25.550
Sure. What would you like?

14:25.610 --> 14:27.210
Four years? Five years?

14:27.280 --> 14:30.480
So, Simpson, you're really
moving to Capital City?

14:30.550 --> 14:31.650
That's right, Ned.

14:31.720 --> 14:33.650
All this stuff
is for sale?

14:33.720 --> 14:36.590
I don't know how
to say this, but...

14:36.650 --> 14:38.080
Knock it off, Flanders.

14:38.160 --> 14:40.360
Don't start blubbering on me.

14:40.430 --> 14:42.730
I'm going to miss you too...
not.

14:42.790 --> 14:44.590
I don't know, Bart.

14:44.660 --> 14:47.190
I'm going to miss you
and all, but...

14:47.270 --> 14:48.440
Come on, Milhouse.

14:48.500 --> 14:50.540
This way we'll be
friends forever.

14:50.600 --> 14:52.140
Well... okay.

14:52.200 --> 14:54.330
Eww!
Eww!

14:54.410 --> 14:56.510
I'm going to miss you,

14:56.570 --> 14:58.740
I'm going to miss <i>you,
spit brother.</i>

14:58.810 --> 15:02.350
I can't help but feel that
if we had gotten to know
each other better

15:02.410 --> 15:04.610
my leaving would
have meant something.

15:04.680 --> 15:05.980
Yeah.
Yeah, right.

15:08.020 --> 15:10.060
Well, we have
one quick stop

15:10.120 --> 15:12.230
and then it's on
to Capital City.

15:12.290 --> 15:13.960
I can't believe it--

15:14.030 --> 15:16.200
our baby sister
in the big city.

15:16.260 --> 15:18.430
I'll call
every day.

Some may say

15:29.270 --> 15:33.100

a bad break in life--

for Capital City

Yes, these must be ours.

would be a little closer
to the action.

Actually, this section
is for the players' ex-wives.

that all the while

19:48.370 --> 19:51.070
<i>Who'd have thought it?
A free ticket to a
big league park</i>

19:51.140 --> 19:54.210
<i>but I was too tense
to enjoy the game.</i>

19:54.270 --> 19:56.980
<i>Every ounce of concentration
I possessed was focused on the
task at hand.</i>

19:57.040 --> 19:58.310
Red Hots!

19:58.380 --> 19:59.580
Get your
Red Hots here!

19:59.640 --> 20:00.740
<i>Ooh, Red Hots.</i>

20:00.810 --> 20:02.320
Announcer:
<i>Ladies and gentlemen</i>

20:02.380 --> 20:07.620
<i>Capital City's newest
sensation, Dancin' H-O-M-E-R!</i>

20:07.690 --> 20:10.220
Mmm, these do taste better
at the ball park.

20:10.290 --> 20:11.330
Uh-oh.

20:13.790 --> 20:14.960
There he is!

20:15.030 --> 20:15.930
<i>I was graceful.</i>

20:15.990 --> 20:17.120
<i>I was witty.</i>

20:17.200 --> 20:20.400
<i>Brother, I was something.</i>

20:20.470 --> 20:22.040
<i>But they didn't care.</i>

20:24.500 --> 20:25.710
What is with
these people?

20:25.770 --> 20:27.470
Why are they sitting
on their hands?

20:27.540 --> 20:28.710
Mom, what's he doing wrong?

20:28.770 --> 20:30.700
I don't know.

20:30.780 --> 20:32.180
<i>It was so quiet</i>

20:32.240 --> 20:34.200
<i>you heard each individual
smart-ass remark.</i>

20:34.280 --> 20:36.820
This guy doesn't
make me want to cheer.

20:36.880 --> 20:40.250
Gee, I really pity him,
making a fool of himself
in front of so many people.

20:40.320 --> 20:44.190
These cornball antics
may play in the sticks,
but this is Capital City.

20:44.260 --> 20:48.200
<i>The only applause I got was
for dragging my carcass
out of there.</i>

20:48.260 --> 20:50.700
Hey, Mr. Showmanship.

20:50.760 --> 20:53.300
The owner wants to see you
in his office right now.

20:53.360 --> 20:55.330
I'm sorry, young man,
but you're just not ready.

20:55.400 --> 20:56.700
Pick up your check
at the office

20:56.770 --> 20:58.440
and for God's sake,
put some clothes on!

20:58.500 --> 21:00.730
Well, I guess it's back
to good old Springfield.

21:00.810 --> 21:02.410
But I can't go back!

21:02.470 --> 21:04.800
Not after I've seen
the bright lights
of Capital City.

21:04.880 --> 21:07.450
I'll wither and die
like a hothouse flower.

21:07.510 --> 21:09.850
Now stop it, you two,
and don't look too down.

21:09.910 --> 21:12.440
I'm sure this is hard enough
for your father.

21:12.520 --> 21:14.050
Yay!
Yay!

21:14.120 --> 21:15.060
Way to go!

21:15.120 --> 21:15.790
Yay, Dad!

21:15.850 --> 21:17.310
What a family.

21:17.390 --> 21:19.190
<i>My wife and kids
stood by me.</i>

21:19.260 --> 21:20.630
<i>On the way home</i>

21:20.690 --> 21:22.900
<i>I realized
how little that helped.</i>

21:22.960 --> 21:24.660
<i>So that's it.</i>

21:24.730 --> 21:26.330
<i>The costume's buried now.</i>

21:26.400 --> 21:29.140
As my son would say,
I'm one sad

21:29.200 --> 21:30.570
apelike dude.

21:30.640 --> 21:31.610
Wow!

21:31.670 --> 21:32.870
What a saga.

21:32.940 --> 21:35.880
Hey. You guys are hanging
on my every word.

21:35.940 --> 21:38.210
I've become
the center of attention.

21:38.280 --> 21:39.580
Yeah, it's riveting.

21:39.640 --> 21:40.740
Tell it again, Homer.

21:40.810 --> 21:42.280
Okay.

21:42.350 --> 21:45.090
I wonder why stories
of degradation and humiliation

21:45.150 --> 21:46.720
make you more popular.

21:46.780 --> 21:48.480
Bartender:
I don't know. They just do.
