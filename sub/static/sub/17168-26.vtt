01:14.141 --> 01:15.774
-Indeed.
-I mean, that goes
without saying..

01:15.776 --> 01:17.075
Yeah, everybody knows
you're a leprechaun.

01:17.077 --> 01:19.611
Why would you all think
I am a leprechaun?

'Cause you're short.

01:37.464 --> 01:39.564
where he has it tilted
to make himself look taller.

01:39.566 --> 01:41.800
And did someone check to see
if he's on his tippy toes?

01:41.802 --> 01:44.202

and dispersion of light
in air-borne water droplets,

Now, just because
you're smaller than me,

09:22.128 --> 09:24.095
don't expect me to be
going easy on ya!

09:24.097 --> 09:26.998
I'd expect
nothing less, brother.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.966
(IRISH MUSIC PLAYING)

09:28.968 --> 09:30.435
(SCREAMING)

09:36.742 --> 09:38.142
ALL: We knew it!

09:38.911 --> 09:40.778
The gold is mine.

09:40.780 --> 09:42.580
Bring it, wee one.

09:52.291 --> 09:54.792
Rainbow pinch!

09:55.761 --> 09:57.662
Shamrock block!

10:00.566 --> 10:03.534
Sha-leah-ray!

10:07.906 --> 10:09.507
-You want some more?
-No!

10:09.509 --> 10:12.276
I yield!
Me pot o' gold is yours!

10:12.278 --> 10:13.778
(ALL CHEERING)

10:18.317 --> 10:20.118
The curse is lifted!

10:20.120 --> 10:23.721
Now let's get out
of here and celebrate
St. Patrick's Day right!

10:23.723 --> 10:26.390
(IRISH ACCENT)
You guys go ahead,
I think I am going to stay.

10:26.392 --> 10:27.258
But why?

10:27.260 --> 10:29.127
The pot of gold, the rainbow.

10:29.129 --> 10:32.463
For the first time in me life,
I feel like I really belong.

10:33.699 --> 10:36.868
We wish you the
best of luck, Robin.

10:38.437 --> 10:40.771
-Sorry about your wife.
-Tis all right.

10:40.773 --> 10:43.641
I am just happy to have
someone here to
share me gold with.

10:46.478 --> 10:49.680
I hope friend Robin
will be happy in his new life.

10:51.884 --> 10:54.619
My man's doing just fine.

10:54.621 --> 10:56.587
Uh, actually,
his wife came back.
