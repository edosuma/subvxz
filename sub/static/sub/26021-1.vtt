00:59.158 --> 01:02.243
After his early work in the
theater in London and New York,

01:02.278 --> 01:04.754
film audiences first
met Atticus Smith

01:04.789 --> 01:08.850
in 1978's tense drama of
sexual mores, "Never look back."

01:08.885 --> 01:10.501
He won a Golden globe in 1981

01:10.503 --> 01:14.618
for his performance as a tortured
Vincent van Gogh in "Starry night."

01:14.653 --> 01:17.773
And in 1984,
his first academy  award for his role

01:17.775 --> 01:20.644
as a shell-shocked,
suicidal army captain

01:20.646 --> 01:23.347
the vietnam epic,
"Charlie everywhere."

01:23.349 --> 01:25.782
He won his second
academy award for his portrayal

01:25.784 --> 01:29.752
of a deaf mute
postman on trial for murder
in "The right to remain silent."

01:29.754 --> 01:33.589
And just last year,
he won the hearts  of a younger audience

01:33.591 --> 01:37.427
with his strikingly
comedic performance
as a weary detective  partnered up

01:37.429 --> 01:40.229
with a drooling bloodhound
named Slobbers.

01:40.231 --> 01:43.173
I'm talking, of course,
about the beloved comedy,

01:43.630 --> 01:45.207
"Cops and Slobbers."

01:46.448 --> 01:47.831
So, let's bring him out here.

01:47.866 --> 01:50.969
Ladies and gentlemen,
Atticus Smith.

01:53.546 --> 01:57.734
They're saying you're up.
- I know. I'm going.

02:08.360 --> 02:12.202
I never got on very
well with my father.
#He was never  much at home, but...

02:13.008 --> 02:16.003
I remember one thing he
said on one of his rare visits,

02:16.038 --> 02:19.735
and that was that... if you
were given a modicum of talent,

02:19.737 --> 02:22.869
you should wear it with
a lightness and a grace.

02:23.641 --> 02:26.614
Well, I seemed to have
failed on that score.

02:26.645 --> 02:29.346
This is terrible.
Who wrote this?

02:29.348 --> 02:31.381
I wrote it? Hmm...

02:31.383 --> 02:35.518
So many friends,
so many legends.

02:35.520 --> 02:39.756
Even people who
fired me in the past.

02:39.758 --> 02:42.792
What I... what I
really want to say

02:42.794 --> 02:44.460
is that I hate these awards.

02:44.462 --> 02:48.332
I mean, lifetime achievement?

02:48.334 --> 02:51.435
I'm not old enough. I mean,
there's some you out there

02:51.437 --> 02:53.792
who are twice as old as me,

02:53.827 --> 02:56.914
and you haven't had your
lifetime achievement awards.

02:56.949 --> 03:01.954
So, let's keep going.
More friends, more films,

03:01.989 --> 03:06.251
because, believe me,
there's life in the old dog yet.

03:07.364 --> 03:09.724
<font color=#FF661C><b>An Actor Prepares</b></font>

03:20.033 --> 03:22.800
All right, welcome to Women in film,
"Cinema through the feminist lens."

03:22.835 --> 03:26.292
I'm Adam... - Are you a sub?
- No, I'm not a sub,  I'm your new professor.

03:26.504 --> 03:29.327
But isn't this supposed to
be from a feminist viewpoint?

03:29.362 --> 03:32.796
Look, feminism is more
than just women's liberation.
#It's also male liberation.

03:34.747 --> 03:37.484
Have any of you seen
my "Anita loos" documentary?

03:37.616 --> 03:40.693
Wasn't that at sundance
this year? - No, it came out in 2007.

03:40.728 --> 03:42.278
What are you working on now?

03:42.313 --> 03:44.863
It's a new documentary, it's
kind of a follow up to my last film.

03:44.898 --> 03:46.610
It's more confrontational.

03:46.645 --> 03:48.593
It calls out a lot of feminists
for not going far enough.

03:48.727 --> 03:51.844
I guess it's kind of like
a trilogy, but within one film.

03:51.879 --> 03:54.864
The second half kind of
contradicts the first half.

03:54.866 --> 03:56.175
It's, uh...

03:56.401 --> 03:59.650
I know, it's hard to explain out of
context.- Is Atticus Smith your dad?

03:59.905 --> 04:03.830
I'm on your Wikipedia page. It says
he's your father. - Shut up, he's famous.

04:03.865 --> 04:06.410
"Father" is kind of a strong
word... - You totally look like him.

04:06.412 --> 04:09.745
He was so hot.
Did you see "Five day fuck"?

04:09.747 --> 04:11.947
The scene
with the butterscotch?

04:11.949 --> 04:14.330
Okay, let's not get
hung up on this, please.

04:14.365 --> 04:15.794
Wait, it says you
were in a movie with him.

04:17.055 --> 04:20.636
Yeah, that was, that was a long
time ago. - "Throwdown at bitch river."

04:21.093 --> 04:23.373
You're credited
as "saloon boy."

04:23.408 --> 04:25.455
Can we just try to get
back on the syllabus here?

04:25.490 --> 04:26.396
Bitch river?
That sounds kind of sexist.

04:28.666 --> 04:31.500
He was so cute!

04:31.502 --> 04:33.036
Middle of nowhere.

04:33.038 --> 04:35.505
August. Sun beating down.

04:35.507 --> 04:37.473
We were shooting...
we'd been up there for six weeks

04:37.475 --> 04:39.476
shooting
"Throwdown at bitch river."

04:39.478 --> 04:43.466
And Dick Harris and I were cockeyed.
I mean, it was hotter than a crotch.

04:43.501 --> 04:46.511
This is gonna make "Lord of the
rings" look like some Indie pile of crap.

04:46.546 --> 04:48.849
I know, I know. - And I saw
him doing coke in the bathroom.

04:48.884 --> 04:52.056
That's hilarious. That's not coke,
that's a chinese herbal supplement.

04:52.091 --> 04:54.673
He's got to snort it through his...
did you see him snorting through his nose?

04:54.708 --> 04:55.987
He's too old to live like this.

04:56.022 --> 05:00.092
Dick, he pulled out
this prop colt .45,

05:00.127 --> 05:03.828
pointed it at him. Well, the guy
went white! He was shitting himself!

05:03.863 --> 05:07.029
He's playing god, literally.
- I know. I negotiated the deal.

05:07.064 --> 05:08.883
Why are you talking like I don't
know what you're talking about?

05:08.918 --> 05:10.523
You took us to the wall
on that one. - I sure did.

05:10.558 --> 05:12.366
It felt good to fuck you.
You have a lot of money.

05:19.985 --> 05:22.350
Hey.
- Oh.

05:24.790 --> 05:27.623
Do you know...

05:27.625 --> 05:31.827
my favorite child is
getting married in ten days?

05:31.829 --> 05:33.964
Married.

05:33.966 --> 05:37.700
Annabel, my little girl.
- You shouldn't have favorites.

05:37.702 --> 05:40.536
Were you doing coke in the
bathroom? - That's preposterous.

05:40.538 --> 05:42.596
Every parent has favorites.

05:42.975 --> 05:46.381
Oh, Jesus, could you hold
this ridiculous thing for me?

05:46.545 --> 05:49.880
My arm's hurting.
- Why does your arm hurt?

05:49.882 --> 05:53.344
I don't know. Probably from
lifting my cock. - Okay, stop.

05:53.656 --> 05:57.229
You can't be doing this in front of all the
studio execs, all right? - Don't be such a suit.

05:57.264 --> 06:00.457
Your dad would be embarrassed.
- Fuck you. The game has changed.

06:00.459 --> 06:03.030
Right. - This is your
"Game of fucking thrones",

06:03.065 --> 06:04.127
you're not even acting like
it's anything at all. - Ow, Jesus!

06:04.129 --> 06:07.096
You all right? Are you okay?
Stop, stop, stop, stop!  Are you okay?

06:07.098 --> 06:08.798
urology center
80s give way to 70s.

06:08.800 --> 06:11.767
That will stay for wednesday.

06:11.769 --> 06:14.171
So if you don't like that heat,
the relief is coming in

06:14.173 --> 06:17.007
As we head on through this week.
Here's the extended forecast now.

06:17.009 --> 06:19.875
There are upper 70s
tuesday and wednesday...

06:19.877 --> 06:22.878
Before we go back to Sam,
some news just coming in.

06:22.880 --> 06:26.582
The actor Atticus Smith has
been hospitalized in Los Angeles.

06:26.584 --> 06:28.952
The 70-year-old, three-time
academy award-winning star

06:28.954 --> 06:32.822
Of such films as "The language
of men" And "Four star general"

06:32.824 --> 06:36.827
Is reportedly in stable condition
after collapsing at an event last night.

06:36.829 --> 06:39.863
Mr. Smith was reportedly set
to start shooting the film "God",

06:39.865 --> 06:42.933
playing the titular role.
We will keep you updated...  - "God"?

06:42.935 --> 06:46.635
Mr. Smith? - Yeah?
- The doctor will see you now.

06:46.637 --> 06:48.940
Style, grace, power.

07:10.062 --> 07:13.863
He's doing fine. I'm looking at him
right now. He's doing amazing.  - What?

07:13.865 --> 07:16.199
The movie doesn't even start filming
till october. - We need him healthy.

07:16.201 --> 07:18.134
What is that? I can't hear you.
There's so much radiation here.

07:18.136 --> 07:20.202
Can you hear me? Hello?
- I know what you're doing!

07:20.204 --> 07:22.105
Hey, everything is great, right?
- Jimmy, stop I can hear you...

07:22.107 --> 07:24.541
Hey, dr. Fischer? - Oh, my god.
- Dr. Fischer,  what's the situation?

07:24.543 --> 07:28.043
It's the same. Dr. Georges
probably wants to operate on him

07:28.045 --> 07:30.747
As early as next week.
- No! No! Are you crazy?

07:30.749 --> 07:33.783
Shh, shh, shh. - No, listen to me,
his daughter's wedding  is next week.

07:33.785 --> 07:35.584
It's the only person
he loves more than himself

07:35.586 --> 07:38.587
And me and my dad.

07:40.259 --> 07:44.094
What's happening?
Is he okay?  - He's up.

07:44.096 --> 07:45.795
Close the door behind you.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:45.797 --> 07:49.699
Would you mind telling me
where the fuck I am? - Good god.

07:49.701 --> 07:53.536
I haven't seen legs like
that on a nurse since the 70s

07:53.538 --> 07:56.973
when they were allowed to
wear short skirts. - I'm dr. Fischer.

07:56.975 --> 07:59.276
Lie back. - Doctor?
- You've had a heart attack.

07:59.278 --> 08:02.312
Take a deep breath
for me. Relax.

08:02.314 --> 08:04.947
Jimmy!
Good god. - Easy.

08:04.949 --> 08:07.716
There you go.

08:07.718 --> 08:11.154
I don't believe it.
- What's going on?  - Easy. Easy.

08:11.156 --> 08:14.241
Who let that Jackass in here?
- Is he okay?

08:14.276 --> 08:16.938
What's he doing
sleeping on a Teddy bear?

08:16.973 --> 08:18.881
Is he hallucinating?
- I don't think so.

08:20.732 --> 08:22.635
It's my goddamn son.

08:24.670 --> 08:27.637
All right, I'm gonna go get him.
- I got a terrible thirst.  Can I have a drink?

08:27.639 --> 08:30.673
Yes. - Don't get
him. Don't get... oh.

08:30.675 --> 08:32.908
Hey, Teddy bear.

08:32.909 --> 08:36.647
Adam.
- Just little sips.

08:36.847 --> 08:39.214
Mm.

08:41.019 --> 08:42.020
Thank you.

08:46.191 --> 08:47.927
You don't look that bad.

08:50.028 --> 08:53.028
You look like
Osama Bin Laden's nutsack.

08:53.030 --> 08:56.310
It's a beard.
- No shit.

08:56.835 --> 08:58.334
You in pain?

08:58.336 --> 09:00.369
Have you ever
had a heart attack?

09:01.139 --> 09:04.770
It's like being shot in
the chest with a fat person.

09:04.805 --> 09:08.810
Can you just answer from a scale of
one to ten instead of absurd metaphors?

09:08.845 --> 09:10.914
Absurd?
Look, I was in Morocco

09:10.916 --> 09:14.783
shooting "Love in the sands"
and I saw a 400-pound Arab

09:14.785 --> 09:18.153
being shot out of a
cannon at a circus.

09:18.155 --> 09:22.457
How'd it happen? - I don't know.
Maybe he climbed up a ladder.

09:22.492 --> 09:23.826
Or perhaps they
lowered him in on a crane.

09:23.828 --> 09:26.161
He's not talking about...
- It was 30 years ago for fuck's sake.

09:26.163 --> 09:28.198
He had major
arterial blockage.

09:28.200 --> 09:31.066
So, what, is he dying?
- Excuse my french,

09:31.068 --> 09:33.305
But why don't you
go fuck yourself?

09:34.905 --> 09:36.138
Yeah, I'm done.

09:36.140 --> 09:39.242
Good.
- Oh.

09:39.244 --> 09:42.808
These are for you, by the way.
- Thank you.  - Yeah.

09:42.843 --> 09:45.897
Men don't bring other
men flowers, by the way.

09:45.932 --> 09:47.883
They're from Annabel, asshole.

09:47.885 --> 09:50.052
I brought you a flagon of
whiskey and a carousel of whores!

09:50.054 --> 09:52.222
Oh, great, great, great. Well,
show them in then, hotshot!

09:52.224 --> 09:55.057
Easy. Stay calm.

09:55.059 --> 09:56.392
Why'd you do that?

09:56.394 --> 09:59.262
Well, thank god he's okay.

09:59.264 --> 10:01.196
Yeah, well, Atticus
always seems to be okay.

10:01.198 --> 10:03.900
Listen, I got to talk
to you about something.

10:03.902 --> 10:05.304
What?

10:07.072 --> 10:09.939
What?

10:09.941 --> 10:14.623
I loathe him. I... - No.
No, no, no. Don't say that.

10:15.768 --> 10:19.008
Do you want history to repeat itself
when we have our own little family?

10:19.183 --> 10:21.218
Are we thinking about that?

10:21.886 --> 10:23.254
Well, we're not...

10:25.724 --> 10:27.860
We're not not thinking of it.

10:29.326 --> 10:31.795
Yeah, I...

10:31.797 --> 10:35.330
Are you okay?
You sound kind of strange.

10:36.967 --> 10:40.469
Adam?
- Yeah. I'm...

10:40.471 --> 10:44.259
How's the score going,
by the way? - Great. - Yeah?

10:44.310 --> 10:45.977
Ian's amazing, like you said.

10:46.012 --> 10:49.119
I brought your old laptop because
mine crashed. I hope you don't mind.

10:49.715 --> 10:52.894
And, oh, I forgot how
fucking awesome crumpets are.

10:53.184 --> 10:54.718
Mmm.

10:54.720 --> 10:56.832
Probably gained a few stone.

10:57.722 --> 11:01.415
I just miss you. I'm sorry.
- Just a week till Annabel's.

11:01.726 --> 11:04.015
I love you.
- I love you, too.

11:09.134 --> 11:11.334
So, I need this
like I need tits.

11:11.336 --> 11:13.869
Oh, my god, I'd love to see you
with big milkies, you know what I mean?

11:13.871 --> 11:16.839
Okay, okay, wait a
second. Wait a second.

11:16.841 --> 11:19.475
We can't insure him. He's fired.
- He's gonna be fine, okay?

11:19.477 --> 11:21.009
You should've brought
roses or something.

11:21.011 --> 11:23.412
A gesture to show...
- Hey, just remember,

11:23.414 --> 11:26.916
I can make one phone call
While I take my morning shit...

11:26.918 --> 11:29.853
Okay. - And get any
actor i want to replace him.

11:29.855 --> 11:32.488
You don't have to think about that.
You're not gonna have to replace him, okay?

11:32.490 --> 11:34.858
Come on, go see him.
Come on, it's fine.

11:34.860 --> 11:38.261
Don't touch me.
I'm coming. - Jimmy!

11:38.263 --> 11:41.263
Jack! This is the head
honcho. It's good of you to...

11:41.265 --> 11:44.199
I'm not gonna beat
around the bush. - Yeah?

11:44.201 --> 11:47.903
I need to protect this
franchise. I need you healthy.

11:47.905 --> 11:50.473
Listen, Jack,
it's just a little operation

11:50.475 --> 11:53.877
and I'm going to be flying.
Isn't that right, doctor?

11:53.879 --> 11:55.778
Okay, nurse will be in shortly.

11:55.780 --> 11:57.914
Thank you, doctor. He's
gonna be great. - Thank you.

11:57.916 --> 12:00.983
I bet she's matches and gasoline
in the sack, wouldn't you say, Jack?

12:00.985 --> 12:03.118
I can hear you.
- You need to follow the rules.

12:03.120 --> 12:05.121
I'm a good soldier, you
know me. - Don't be cute.

12:05.123 --> 12:06.855
Look, sit down, sit down,
sit down, Jack.

12:06.857 --> 12:09.974
You'll wear yourself out standing
there. - Can you keep it clean?

12:10.009 --> 12:12.262
Yeah, sure.
- No drinking, no drugging?

12:12.264 --> 12:15.309
Yeah... - No fucking?
- Oh, come on,  I'm an old man now.

12:15.344 --> 12:16.750
Don't dick around with me.

12:17.694 --> 12:20.516
This isn't like it used to be
when we were young and free.

12:20.551 --> 12:23.332
I mean, I have a responsibility
to my shareholders now.

12:23.508 --> 12:26.630
I answer to a board,
and like it or not, so do you.

12:26.665 --> 12:30.868
Yeah, well, all right.
I get it. No tits, toots, or sips.

12:30.903 --> 12:34.715
I need your word, Atticus. - You have
my word!  You have Jimmy's word, too.

12:34.750 --> 12:37.252
Yeah, there's no tits, tats
or tips... there's none of it.

12:37.287 --> 12:39.928
That's right, I mean...
come on, Jack, we go back.

12:41.681 --> 12:44.184
We're gonna do this
show... with or without you.

12:46.096 --> 12:49.399
Okay. - Okay, I
got to get back.

12:49.500 --> 12:53.036
Get better. - Good of you to come.
- Thanks for coming by, Jack.

12:53.038 --> 12:55.827
That means a lot. I appreciate it,
buddy. - Give my love to Maybelline.

12:55.874 --> 12:57.210
Yeah, yeah.

13:12.323 --> 13:15.139
So, dad, how are you
feeling now? Are you okay?

13:15.174 --> 13:18.307
Sweetheart, I'm fine. I've never felt
better. You've got nothing to worry about.

13:18.342 --> 13:20.285
Dad, come on, nothing to worry
about? You're in the hospital.

13:20.419 --> 13:21.970
He was doing
coke! - What? - Okay.

13:22.005 --> 13:24.526
Jesus christ, when I get out of
here I'm gonna smash your face.

13:24.561 --> 13:28.364
Your brother is here,
unfortunately.

13:28.399 --> 13:29.796
Do not fight with him.

13:29.831 --> 13:32.214
You've got to keep
your stress levels down.

13:33.077 --> 13:35.411
Are you listening to
the doctors? - Yes, yes, yes,

13:35.413 --> 13:38.580
Dr. Fischer's got me
well under control.

13:38.582 --> 13:40.564
She's gonna have me out

13:40.652 --> 13:43.436
looking bright and
breezy for the wedding.

13:43.471 --> 13:46.494
No, you need to stay put.
- What? You're gonna postpone it?

13:46.529 --> 13:49.892
No, we can't change the date, dad.
Mom's already paid for everything.

13:49.894 --> 13:51.766
But tell her
I'll reimburse her.

13:51.801 --> 13:54.930
For god's sake, it's my money anyway,
technically. Your mother is a bitch.

13:54.932 --> 13:58.133
Is dr. Fischer there? - Oh, wow.
- Dr. Fischer is always here,

13:58.135 --> 14:00.035
Lurking. - Great,
put me on speaker.

14:00.105 --> 14:03.886
Hi, Annabel. - Dr. Fischer,
can you tell me what happens next?

14:03.921 --> 14:06.483
Okay, he has severe
arterial blockage.

14:06.518 --> 14:09.409
He's gonna need surgery imminently
so this doesn't happen again.

14:09.444 --> 14:12.348
I've spoken to our surgeon...
- And I've spoken...

14:12.350 --> 14:15.184
I've spoken to my
surgeon in New York, dr. Zisser.

14:15.186 --> 14:18.554
He's the best
heart surgeon in America,

14:18.556 --> 14:20.470
probably in the world.

14:20.505 --> 14:23.055
And he's gonna de-clog
me after the wedding

14:23.090 --> 14:26.972
in plenty of time for the start
date on "God." Is that right, Jimmy?

14:27.007 --> 14:29.476
If you don't die first.
- He cannot fly.

14:29.600 --> 14:33.036
He had me look into a medical bus.
- Or a fucking ambulance while you're at it.

14:33.038 --> 14:35.059
That's a great idea.
We can turn on the sirens!

14:35.834 --> 14:38.184
Dr. Zisser is very good.
- Well, there we are.

14:38.456 --> 14:41.503
I'm certainly not gonna have anybody
else cut into me, so the decision is made.

14:41.645 --> 14:44.610
Technically, a medical bus is
possible. - So, we have a deal.

14:44.645 --> 14:46.634
But I don't recommend...
- Jimmy can drive me. - I can't do it.

14:46.669 --> 14:47.930
I have other clients.

14:47.965 --> 14:50.609
Goddamn it, you're not
supposed to say you got other clients.

14:50.644 --> 14:54.024
Adam's gonna have to drive you.
- What? No! - Are you out of your mind?

14:54.059 --> 14:56.325
Why the fuck am I getting yelled at?
- Both of you shut up. - I'm sorry,

14:56.327 --> 14:58.580
We're just... we were
just discussing something.

14:58.615 --> 15:02.137
You think this horseshit between the two of
you only affects your relationship. It doesn't.

15:02.172 --> 15:04.744
It bleeds into
absolutely everything.

15:04.779 --> 15:08.144
Dad, the only way
that you're gonna be able

15:08.179 --> 15:09.830
to come to this wedding
is if Adam brings you,

15:09.865 --> 15:11.892
I want you both
there, so you decide.

15:11.927 --> 15:15.303
Bella, you're really backing us into
a corner here. - Yeah, a big corner.

15:15.338 --> 15:17.134
Can you put
Adam on? - Why?

15:17.481 --> 15:19.566
She wants to talk
to me,all right?

15:21.753 --> 15:23.530
Yeah, hang on a sec.

15:26.725 --> 15:29.624
Adam, have I ever
asked you for anything?

15:29.626 --> 15:31.552
Yes, many times.

15:31.587 --> 15:34.458
Honestly, Adam,
I'm standing here,

15:34.493 --> 15:38.166
I'm having this
conversation... in a wedding gown.

15:38.168 --> 15:41.017
Just get over yourselves
and get him to New York.

15:47.745 --> 15:49.575
You saved my life,

15:50.715 --> 15:53.315
and I don't even
know your name.

15:53.317 --> 15:57.020
It's Lucy.
- Lucy. - Mm-Hmm.

15:57.022 --> 16:00.178
What a lovely lucy you are.
- This is clopidogrel bisulfate.

16:00.213 --> 16:02.027
It's an antiplatelet drug.

16:02.062 --> 16:05.094
I want you to take one every
day before the operation, okay?

16:05.096 --> 16:07.560
It's essential.
I told your son,

16:07.631 --> 16:12.155
Given him instructions as well.
- Can I engage on it? - Engage?

16:13.772 --> 16:16.355
No, no.

16:16.390 --> 16:19.755
You cannot engage
with anyone or anything.

16:19.790 --> 16:23.708
There's no drinking, there's no
smoking, there's no fried food,

16:23.743 --> 16:25.789
there's no sugar.
- No sugar?

16:30.321 --> 16:32.163
You mended my heart.

16:33.258 --> 16:37.067
It is with the heart
that we see truly.

16:37.394 --> 16:41.611
The essentials
are invisible to the eye.

16:42.366 --> 16:44.394
Will you stop doing
that, you asshole?

16:45.624 --> 16:46.616
Lucy,

16:46.651 --> 16:50.097
Sorry we didn't meet
sooner. Thank you. - Yes.

16:51.609 --> 16:54.346
Mm, mm! Oh.

17:00.751 --> 17:03.313
Au revoir.
- Yeah, okay, ciao.

17:13.131 --> 17:14.529
What?

17:14.531 --> 17:17.151
You're a very sad,
sad man, aren't you?

17:21.839 --> 17:25.607
Oh, this place smells
like pussy. - Oh, fuck me.

17:25.608 --> 17:29.444
I'm gonna shower up. Pour me
four fingers of scotch, will you?

17:29.446 --> 17:32.849
No ice. - It's 8:30
in the morning.

17:32.851 --> 17:35.760
Well, then buzz room service
and get some bloody marys

17:35.795 --> 17:37.248
And whatever
you want to drink.

17:38.175 --> 17:39.312
Oh.

17:43.161 --> 17:47.529
<font color=#00FF80> <i><b># Figaro, Figaro,
Figaro, Figaro, Figaro</b></i> </font>

18:04.214 --> 18:08.251
What the fuck?
- Where's room service, huh?

18:08.286 --> 18:12.449
I didn't call them. - Why not?
- Because I was meditating. - Meditating?

18:13.336 --> 18:15.092
I thought that went
out in the '70s.

18:16.426 --> 18:19.149
Could you put some clothes on,
please? Your crotch is in my face.

18:19.463 --> 18:22.494
Well, I'm sorry you didn't inherit
a dick from my side of the family.

18:22.529 --> 18:24.398
It's a hell of a line.

18:25.435 --> 18:27.671
Good to know you were up-close
and personal with grandpa's dick.

18:27.706 --> 18:29.195
Damn hard to miss.

18:29.807 --> 18:33.044
Look, trust me, I'm good. - Well,
whip it out then, let's have a look.

18:34.612 --> 18:35.878
I'm not having a
dick contest with you.

18:35.880 --> 18:38.648
Well, then I rest my case.

18:38.650 --> 18:41.830
God, can you put your old
haggard cock away, please?

18:41.865 --> 18:43.530
It looks like
a rotten banana.

18:45.204 --> 18:46.395
Looks pretty good to me.

18:46.824 --> 18:48.683
Certainly does the job.

18:48.926 --> 18:51.987
Damn it, this is
Shotgun Willie's bus.

18:52.196 --> 18:55.634
The last time I was on this bus, we
were shooting "Bloody mary morning."

18:55.669 --> 18:59.224
Whose bus? - Willie goddamn Nelson.
- Nope. - He must be playing the bowl.

18:59.259 --> 19:00.972
It's not Willie Nelson's
bus. This is your bus.

19:01.007 --> 19:03.184
And that, my friend,
is Arnold, your driver.

19:03.219 --> 19:06.479
Hey, I'll call you back.
Hey, brother.  - Arnold.

19:06.678 --> 19:08.580
It's a pleasure.
Put it there.

19:08.880 --> 19:12.068
What chapter are you?
- Fourth. - Fourth? - Come on aboard.

19:12.103 --> 19:14.556
Show me the sights, Arnold.
Was this Willie's bus once?

19:14.591 --> 19:17.194
Can I talk to you for a second? - What?
Come here, I need to talk to you for a second.

19:17.229 --> 19:19.758
Can I put the bags down?
- Are you fucking... what is going on?

19:20.959 --> 19:24.360
The studio is fucking pissed, Ok?
They know about the entire trip.

19:24.362 --> 19:27.729
How do they know? - Because
my assistant is a fucking dickhole

19:27.731 --> 19:29.431
who doesn't know how
to keep his mouth shut.

19:29.433 --> 19:32.310
That guy over there,
that is a spy sent from Jack.

19:32.345 --> 19:34.128
He's also a nurse,
so if something goes wrong,

19:34.163 --> 19:37.006
You can lean on him, but the only thing
you have to know, he is not on our side.

19:37.008 --> 19:39.078
I'll be sleeping
on the couch in here.

19:39.113 --> 19:41.307
Uh-huh. - Here's
your wardrobe in here.

19:42.346 --> 19:45.381
Shitter in here.
- Uh-huh.

19:45.383 --> 19:49.317
Refrigerator.
Trash. Coffee.

19:49.319 --> 19:51.754
You got your TV, your
stereo, and surround sound.

19:51.756 --> 19:54.211
Atticus does not
have much family, all right?

19:54.358 --> 19:56.324
I mean, you sold him down
the river fucking years ago,

19:56.359 --> 19:58.834
And he barely sees Annabel. - I sold
him down the river?  - Yeah, you did.

19:58.869 --> 20:00.899
He was fucking around on my
mother like the energizer bunny.

20:00.934 --> 20:03.766
That's my fault? - He's a cocksman.
- Oh, that's an excuse now,

20:03.768 --> 20:05.855
That he's a cocksman?
- Yes!

20:05.890 --> 20:07.402
Why amI talking to you
about this? I'm not your shrink.

20:07.404 --> 20:10.097
I barely even know who you are.
- You fucking probably brought it up.

20:10.132 --> 20:11.940
I don't know why we're in this
in the first place. Calm down. Okay.

20:11.942 --> 20:13.832
Stop, listen, okay?

20:13.867 --> 20:16.760
The only thing in his goddamn
life that he has is his work,

20:16.795 --> 20:18.449
and he is this
close to losing it.

20:18.548 --> 20:21.888
So do me a favor, all right?
Take care of him.

20:21.923 --> 20:23.961
'Cause i don't know
how much time you have left.

20:24.955 --> 20:26.473
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

20:27.950 --> 20:29.416
For real, do you
understand? - Yeah.

20:30.758 --> 20:31.966
You ever been in the joint?

20:32.430 --> 20:35.930
I did a stretch at San Quentin.
- Me, too. What'd they get you for?

20:35.932 --> 20:38.349
Grievous bodily.

20:38.736 --> 20:42.671
I did two nights in gen pop
for preparation for "Cross bar."

20:42.673 --> 20:46.191
You were badass in
that, man. - I was. - Yeah.

20:46.226 --> 20:49.223
Gut-Shanked a screw
with a toothbrush.

20:49.258 --> 20:50.383
Ah!

20:52.950 --> 20:54.446
Listen, man.

20:56.054 --> 20:58.447
This kid's really jamming me up.

20:59.757 --> 21:03.957
Could you get me some booze
and maybe a little bit of... you know?

21:05.762 --> 21:09.333
I've got 15 years clean.
- What do you mean?

21:09.467 --> 21:11.285
Clean and sober.

21:11.336 --> 21:13.989
15... why?

21:14.024 --> 21:17.445
Best thing i ever done, brother.
- Oh, come on, cut the crap.

21:17.480 --> 21:20.339
I don't know what they're paying you...
- Not happening.  - I'll double it.

21:20.374 --> 21:22.379
The studio gives
me stuntman work.

21:22.613 --> 21:25.794
You have any fucking idea
how much that pays in residuals?

21:57.115 --> 21:59.949
"It came to pass
after the death of Abraham,

21:59.951 --> 22:04.786
God blessed his son Isaac.

22:04.788 --> 22:08.457
Isaac Dwelt by the..."
- Are you reading the bible?

22:08.459 --> 22:10.692
Yeah.
- Why?

22:10.694 --> 22:12.594
Preparation.

22:13.570 --> 22:14.802
For what? Death?

22:15.665 --> 22:17.425
It's research.

22:18.603 --> 22:22.984
There's more to playing God
than learning the fucking lines.

22:25.643 --> 22:28.878
Can you get porn on that?
- One could, I don't.

22:28.880 --> 22:31.146
Let's have a look, come on.

22:31.148 --> 22:32.882
Here, give me the...
what do you press?

22:32.884 --> 22:34.517
I'm looking at mark
and Annabel's wedding registry.

22:34.519 --> 22:36.340
Mark.

22:38.155 --> 22:40.393
What's Mark's background?

22:42.527 --> 22:46.321
He was a jock.
He used to play for the Cubs.

22:47.064 --> 22:49.532
He used to be their
star pitcher or something.

22:49.534 --> 22:52.527
He retired a few years ago. - Yeah,
yeah, I don't need the whole biography.

22:52.970 --> 22:56.538
I mean...

22:56.540 --> 22:57.966
Is he full of shit?

22:58.875 --> 23:00.144
I don't know.

23:01.778 --> 23:04.603
He sent me a birthday
card on my birthday.

23:05.615 --> 23:07.737
I mean, what sort
of dipshit does that?

23:08.952 --> 23:12.187
He wanted to be nice
to his future father-In-law.

23:12.222 --> 23:13.430
My God, what an asshole.

23:15.992 --> 23:17.374
Do you trust him?

23:18.061 --> 23:19.689
I need to tell you something.

23:21.065 --> 23:22.220
Yeah?

23:22.567 --> 23:24.884
Arnold...
- Arnold, yeah.

23:25.068 --> 23:27.236
... the studio sent
him to spy on you.

23:27.238 --> 23:29.573
No shit, really?

23:29.906 --> 23:31.411
What, you knew?

23:32.910 --> 23:36.097
I'm hip to it.
- "Hip to it?" - Yeah.

23:36.146 --> 23:37.954
I can read people, me.

23:38.816 --> 23:40.162
That's a laugh.

23:40.785 --> 23:45.208
$350 for a jam jar?

23:45.789 --> 23:49.447
Jesus, it's obscene. - Well,
what do you care? You're rich.

23:49.482 --> 23:51.626
Yeah, well I'm, not going to shell
out that sort of money for a jam jar.

23:51.628 --> 23:54.643
And forgive my asking, but
doesn't jam already come in a jar?

23:57.835 --> 24:00.501
What do you
do by the way, eh?

24:01.672 --> 24:02.847
For a living?

24:04.141 --> 24:06.279
Seriously, you
don't know what I do?

24:06.676 --> 24:09.812
Well...

24:09.814 --> 24:11.397
maybe I forgot.

24:13.750 --> 24:16.431
I'm a documentarian.
- No!

24:16.466 --> 24:18.890
I make documentaries
about women in film.

24:19.022 --> 24:21.808
Why have you never
interviewed me? I love women.

24:21.959 --> 24:23.449
Ha!

24:24.795 --> 24:26.092
"Ha"?

24:27.097 --> 24:28.670
What does "ha" mean?

24:45.650 --> 24:48.984
Whoa, this is a great campsite. You
used to love camping  when you were little.

24:48.986 --> 24:51.726
You never took me
camping. - I did.  - No.

24:51.761 --> 24:55.008
I did. - No, you didn't. - Well,
your mother did. - No, she didn't.

24:55.043 --> 24:56.330
Well, she should have done.

24:56.672 --> 24:59.857
They say there are bears here.
- We in bear country? - Yeah.

25:00.330 --> 25:02.786
We sure are.
Don't wander off.

25:03.300 --> 25:05.034
They'll rip you apart.

25:05.303 --> 25:06.601
Yeah?

25:08.005 --> 25:09.794
I fucking hate bears.

25:10.074 --> 25:11.574
They'll eat you up.

25:17.147 --> 25:18.750
Jesus!

25:19.650 --> 25:22.841
Porn's so fucking
extreme these days.

25:22.876 --> 25:24.273
You need to take your pills.

25:24.308 --> 25:27.877
Smacking a woman with the tip of the old
white snake doesn't do it for me, I'll tell ya.

25:27.912 --> 25:30.101
This is like basketball.

25:31.695 --> 25:34.662
Have you got any salve?
I chafe like a chalkboard.

25:34.664 --> 25:36.332
You're not masturbating
with my ipad.

25:36.334 --> 25:38.066
Give it back to me...
- Nope, nope. You can bugger off.

25:38.068 --> 25:40.009
Atticus give it back, please.

25:46.344 --> 25:49.578
Here we are.
Nice cup of tea.

25:50.681 --> 25:54.000
Thanks.
- Hmm, don't mention it.

26:00.825 --> 26:02.478
"Seven angry women."

26:03.693 --> 26:06.061
"A study in 17 parts

26:06.063 --> 26:10.190
on the guiding principle
of the female spirit."

26:12.068 --> 26:13.567
Is this what you're working on?

26:13.602 --> 26:15.045
What do you think?

26:16.272 --> 26:19.044
Well, it's not
a very catchy title.

26:19.644 --> 26:21.995
Well, it's not supposed
to be catchy.

26:22.030 --> 26:24.981
I mean, it's post-post
modernist docu-feminist criticism, so...

26:25.016 --> 26:25.998
Post-what?

26:27.917 --> 26:31.364
You wouldn't understand.
- Yes, but would anybody?

26:31.399 --> 26:33.348
It's a bit muddled.

26:34.466 --> 26:35.946
Oh, shit,
you're right, Atticus.

26:36.760 --> 26:39.260
Your two-second visual
snatch of my work must be right.

26:39.262 --> 26:42.730
I mean, that's 8 years
of my life. 8 years of my life.

26:42.732 --> 26:44.498
But you think it's muddled.

26:45.001 --> 26:47.347
You know what? Fuck it.
Maybe I'll just chuck it, right?

26:47.382 --> 26:51.189
It was just an observation.
- Yeah, thanks for that.

26:54.944 --> 26:56.225
Touchy.

27:37.020 --> 27:40.756
There's a bear in the back! There's
a bear! - Shit, are you kidding me?

27:40.758 --> 27:44.392
There's a bear in the back! - Ah!
In the back of the bus! In the back of the bus!

27:44.394 --> 27:46.761
There's a bear!
There's a bear!

28:20.029 --> 28:22.366
Oh, Jesus.
What time is it?

28:24.934 --> 28:27.872
Hey, where's Atticus?
- I'm here.

28:29.874 --> 28:31.489
Where the hell's Arnold?

28:32.209 --> 28:36.147
I killed him. - What?
- Choked him to death in his sleep,

28:36.182 --> 28:38.972
Buried him under a teepee.
- What are you talking about?

28:39.007 --> 28:41.917
He jumped ship.
- Well, now I gotta call Jimmy.

28:41.919 --> 28:45.386
No, no, no, wait, wait, wait.
- No. - Adam, Adam, Adam, Adam, Adam.

28:45.388 --> 28:49.290
Son...

28:49.292 --> 28:52.527
Listen, I wasn't going
to tell you this,

28:52.529 --> 28:54.768
I didn't want to
lay it on you, but...

28:55.465 --> 28:57.767
you're being such
an asshole, I've got to.

28:58.035 --> 28:59.051
No, wait.

29:01.238 --> 29:05.068
Like Jimmy said, maybe you and
I should get to know each other.

29:05.103 --> 29:06.783
Oh, god.
- Make up.

29:08.144 --> 29:09.856
Put things right between us.

29:11.080 --> 29:13.360
Oh, this should be good.
I'm all ears, Atticus.

29:14.084 --> 29:15.408
What kind of things?

29:15.519 --> 29:18.036
Well, you know, things.
I mean...

29:19.589 --> 29:22.557
Well, I can't think
of anything...

29:22.559 --> 29:26.508
that I can... it's hard to know
where to start. I mean, um...

29:26.543 --> 29:29.669
Wow, that was beautiful.

29:29.704 --> 29:32.782
Thank you. - What I'm
trying to say, listen to me,

29:32.817 --> 29:33.912
I'm trying...

29:36.073 --> 29:39.235
I mean, we hardly know
each other. It's been 15 years.

29:39.270 --> 29:41.910
I'm gonna be gone soon.
- Oh, Jesus.

29:41.912 --> 29:45.613
It's not that I...
the hell did you just do?

29:45.615 --> 29:48.097
Asshole!

29:48.132 --> 29:49.840
I threw your phone
out of the window.

29:49.953 --> 29:53.221
What the fuck, Atticus? I need my
phone! I'm expect...  - Oh, calm down.

29:53.223 --> 29:56.424
No, I need my fucking phone! - What's
so important  about your phone anyway?

29:56.426 --> 29:58.259
I have to call Clemmy.

29:58.261 --> 30:02.104
Who's Clammy?
- Clem, my partner.

30:02.232 --> 30:04.600
Oh. That's a surprise.

30:04.602 --> 30:06.633
How long have you
two guys been together?

30:06.668 --> 30:09.098
Oh, very funny.
She's my girlfriend.

30:09.133 --> 30:13.052
Well, why don't you say that?
- Because I don't like to infantilize her, all right?

30:13.087 --> 30:14.517
She's not a girl.
She's a woman.

30:14.552 --> 30:16.731
Not that you know the difference...
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

30:16.766 --> 30:19.077
Vegas, 21 miles.
- Oh...

30:19.112 --> 30:20.515
Well! - We're
not going to Vegas!

30:20.517 --> 30:24.549
We better get some breakfast, build up
our strength, it's gonna be one hell of a night.

30:28.325 --> 30:31.770
You think there's sugar
in the oatmeal? - Probably.

30:31.895 --> 30:35.122
I loved you
in "Deep stack Johnson."

30:35.157 --> 30:38.480
Did you? - Yeah!
- Thank you. I played a gambler.

30:38.515 --> 30:41.448
He did. - Hmm.
- I was quite good actually.

30:41.672 --> 30:46.434
I'll have the breakfast
plate combo and some f...

30:46.644 --> 30:49.940
No, hash browns and, um...

30:50.180 --> 30:53.448
A couple of those apple things.
- Do you want me to biggy-size that for you?

30:53.450 --> 30:57.020
Absolutely. I haven't
got any cash. You...

30:57.055 --> 30:59.983
Of course. - Do you
want a coffee?  - No.

31:00.257 --> 31:03.784
Oatmeal.
- Oatmeal. Okay.

31:06.430 --> 31:08.563
Can I just point out, you're
supposed to be eating healthy,

31:08.565 --> 31:11.238
not clogging up that
filthy black heart of yours?

31:11.273 --> 31:13.196
This is eggs, potato,

31:13.231 --> 31:14.812
sausage.
- Whatever.

31:15.138 --> 31:16.295
I'm not your mother.

31:16.941 --> 31:20.963
My mother drank two dry
martinis every night till she was 96,

31:21.077 --> 31:24.578
and she's your grandmother.
- Yeah, I kinda put that together.

31:24.580 --> 31:26.607
Mm, this is so good.

31:26.717 --> 31:30.973
There's definitely sugar
in this. - You used to love sugar.

31:30.988 --> 31:32.864
Yeah, well, sugar's poison.

31:33.390 --> 31:37.325
See, we're basically being sodomized
by monsanto right now. - I used to slip

31:37.327 --> 31:41.310
a packet of M&Ms into your schoolbag,
remember? When your mother wasn't looking.

31:43.067 --> 31:45.166
Put that in the plus
column, would you?

31:52.442 --> 31:55.031
You know that wasn't
bullshit about feeling old.

31:56.547 --> 31:58.915
This could be
the end of the line.

32:01.117 --> 32:03.629
Look, after the operation,
you'll probably be humping

32:03.664 --> 32:05.725
Some extra's leg in
no time. - No, come on.

32:05.760 --> 32:07.608
Those big operations,
you know...

32:08.192 --> 32:09.945
They really fuck you up.

32:12.429 --> 32:15.090
You're aging. It happens.

32:17.433 --> 32:19.691
We're basically all
just born to die.

32:21.404 --> 32:24.654
I happen to think
that we're born to live.

32:26.175 --> 32:27.730
Oh, that's profound.

32:28.144 --> 32:30.283
Well, listen, I've got
five nights left.

32:31.048 --> 32:33.387
Five nights before
we get to the wedding.

32:34.651 --> 32:39.389
And they cut me open, and...
God knows what will happen.

32:39.424 --> 32:42.534
This is like the last flight of
the shuttle before they retire it.

32:42.569 --> 32:46.094
Oh, god. This could be my last run.
- Please stop talking in metaphors.

32:46.096 --> 32:48.189
You're either for
me or against me.

32:49.400 --> 32:52.081
And god help you
if you're against me.

32:56.272 --> 32:59.075
Jesus, watch it.
- Hey! - Thanks very much.

33:05.449 --> 33:06.934
Who's driving?

33:32.843 --> 33:34.742
How long have I been asleep?

33:34.744 --> 33:36.312
A couple hours.

33:37.181 --> 33:39.551
What? A couple of hours?
Jesus.

33:39.586 --> 33:41.401
Must have needed it.

33:42.457 --> 33:44.202
Have we passed Vegas?
- Yep.

33:44.354 --> 33:47.756
Oh, God.
Pull off at the next exit.

33:47.758 --> 33:49.458
We've got to turn
the bus around and go back.

33:49.460 --> 33:57.097
Sorry, papa bear,
house always wins.

33:57.132 --> 33:58.266
You know, you
used to be a good actor.

33:58.268 --> 33:59.675
Had great promise.

34:00.336 --> 34:03.157
I don't know why
you walked away from it.

34:03.192 --> 34:04.605
Oh, I wonder why.

34:04.607 --> 34:08.275
Mm, so did I.

34:08.277 --> 34:11.746
Lack of balls, boy.
- You're a terrible father.

34:11.748 --> 34:15.103
Oh, come on. For Christ's
sake, lay off me, can't you?

34:15.139 --> 34:18.618
I got one foot in the grave,
I'm living on borrowed time.

34:18.652 --> 34:20.254
Yeah, well, we all are.

34:27.530 --> 34:30.882
Maybe it wouldn't be the worst thing
in the world if we did some bonding.

34:30.918 --> 34:32.179
Okay.

34:33.436 --> 34:36.893
How do you want to start?
Should we have a hug in?

34:39.143 --> 34:40.989
What was your father like?

34:42.210 --> 34:45.213
Oh, Jesus Christ,
You're gonna start there?  - What?

34:45.215 --> 34:48.610
I was 4 when he died. I barely
knew him. - Yeah, well, well, let's just...

34:49.686 --> 34:52.792
say he was difficult to
talk to and leave it at that.

34:52.827 --> 34:56.438
Did he see any of your
movies? - Well, I don't know.

34:57.594 --> 34:59.680
Do you think he was
proud of you at least?

34:59.715 --> 35:01.492
Where are you
going with this?

35:01.931 --> 35:04.395
Why are you so uncomfortable
talking about your father?

35:04.430 --> 35:05.688
I'm not...

35:06.670 --> 35:08.833
Hey, hey, hey,
we got a situation.

35:08.938 --> 35:12.322
Oh! Hello!
Hey, sweetheart.

35:12.708 --> 35:15.393
Whoa! Ha!

35:15.428 --> 35:18.970
Hi, girlies.
Honk the horn.

35:19.005 --> 35:21.449
I'm not gonna honk the horn.
- Hey! Honk the horn. Honk the horn.

35:21.451 --> 35:22.992
No.
- They waved at me!

35:23.027 --> 35:24.816
Go on, honk the horn.
- No.

35:25.621 --> 35:28.356
Go faster.
#Hit them! Hit them!  - No!

35:28.358 --> 35:30.691
Go on, just hit them!
- No!  - Just hit them.

35:30.693 --> 35:33.528
Honk the horn and hit them.
- Stop. Stop! - Oh, Jesus.

35:33.530 --> 35:34.874
They're getting away.

35:36.199 --> 35:37.690
We lost them.

35:39.670 --> 35:41.724
That would have been
a great way to bond.

35:58.454 --> 35:59.456
Hey.

36:03.559 --> 36:07.183
I love you.
- What?

36:11.400 --> 36:12.402
Nothing.

36:24.880 --> 36:27.715
Don't go anywhere
because when we return...

36:27.717 --> 36:31.253
I can't believe
we're watching this crap

36:31.255 --> 36:35.356
Sitting in the back
of a fucking bus

36:35.358 --> 36:37.825
In a sears parking lot.

36:37.827 --> 36:40.862
It's a walmart.
- Well, whatever.

36:40.864 --> 36:43.154
I'm supposed to be a star.

36:46.369 --> 36:49.970
I haven't lived in these cramped
conditions since I was in the army.

36:49.972 --> 36:52.054
You were never in the army.

36:52.089 --> 36:56.142
Well, I made so many army
films, I might as well have been.

36:56.177 --> 36:59.158
Listen, I'm gonna
go on a pizza run.

37:00.751 --> 37:03.851
Hi, mr. Smith.
This is dr. Khazar's office.

37:03.853 --> 37:08.116
Calling to set up a follow-up
appointment. Please call us...

37:14.998 --> 37:18.599
Hey. - Hey. Oh, my god.
I'm so sorry I haven't called.

37:18.601 --> 37:20.552
Atticus threw my
phone out the window.

37:21.905 --> 37:24.586
Why are you
researching urologists?

37:24.621 --> 37:26.298
What?

37:26.476 --> 37:29.221
God, I can't believe you're
researching vasectomies again.

37:31.347 --> 37:33.048
Hang on a second, why were
you looking at my search history?

37:33.050 --> 37:35.816
Isn't that kind of a breach of trust?
- You don't you think that clandestine

37:35.818 --> 37:37.960
vasectomy research
is more of a breach?

37:37.995 --> 37:41.563
Vasectomies? - Adam, i thought you
were over this. I thought we were over this.

37:41.598 --> 37:44.065
Are you trying to avoid
having kids with me?

37:44.728 --> 37:46.726
No. No.
- Really?

37:47.781 --> 37:49.127
'Cause it seems like it.

37:49.162 --> 37:51.461
Look, I'm not...
- Listen, I have to concentrate

37:51.496 --> 37:53.060
on my documentary
for the next few days.

37:53.095 --> 37:54.924
Let's just talk at
Annabel's wedding, okay?

37:55.706 --> 37:57.765
I mean, I can't believe
we're back here again.

37:58.858 --> 38:01.369
I promise I won't research
vasectomies anymore, okay?

38:01.677 --> 38:04.545
Hey, Clem, we're going
to do a mix of the first cue.

38:04.547 --> 38:06.974
I gotta go. I'm in the
recording studio. - Okay.

38:09.146 --> 38:10.674
I love you.
- You, too. Bye.

38:29.972 --> 38:32.057
I thought of
tying my nuts once.

38:34.643 --> 38:36.322
Before you were born.

38:38.481 --> 38:40.944
Of course, if I had, I
wouldn't have had your sister.

38:44.387 --> 38:46.256
I'm all for it.

38:46.291 --> 38:48.376
I think...
i think they can be great.

38:51.628 --> 38:55.025
If you want... my two cents.

38:59.635 --> 39:02.490
I'm not very good
at advice, I'm afraid.

39:17.721 --> 39:19.952

40:18.815 --> 40:20.148
Do you think he has to shout?

40:20.150 --> 40:23.497
"Abraham, give me a son!"

40:23.532 --> 40:26.753
He should have gravitas. He
wouldn't have to shout, God, would he?

40:26.755 --> 40:29.824
He'd have someone to relay it
for him. Perhaps he could telephone.

40:29.826 --> 40:33.595
But, I mean, if you did, then you
could have, you could hear Abraham

40:33.597 --> 40:36.197
Replying through the... you
know, that sort of telephone voice.

40:36.199 --> 40:38.700
That would be quite
modern, wouldn't it?

41:28.617 --> 41:32.119
Wow, I haven't been here
since we shot "Throwdown."

41:32.121 --> 41:34.155
I can't believe you
kept it all these years.

41:34.157 --> 41:37.085
This is where
I want to be buried.

41:38.027 --> 41:39.760
I'll have to throw a
rock through the window.

41:39.762 --> 41:42.098
I don't know...
where I left the keys.

41:49.072 --> 41:50.508
We should maybe...

41:53.809 --> 41:57.069
Bobby must have opened it up.
I'll see if he's turned on the water.

42:25.275 --> 42:26.911
Atticus?

42:29.913 --> 42:31.811
Fuck it.

42:32.315 --> 42:36.579
You should come in, Adam. I can't
believe the old cooch pot is still working.

42:36.614 --> 42:39.129
It's beautiful. - You're
drinking? - A little aperitif.

42:39.164 --> 42:41.793
What's the matter with you? You
can't even wait till the operation?

42:41.828 --> 42:45.278
Have you ever seen
a red-throated loon?

42:45.313 --> 42:49.066
They're very rare...
and they're very shy.

42:49.101 --> 42:51.798
And I think...

42:51.800 --> 42:54.869
That's one sitting on the
branch over there. Have a look.

42:54.871 --> 42:56.742
You know what?
Throw your life away.

42:56.806 --> 43:00.263
Everyone should be so
lucky, right? - Adam, come on.

43:00.777 --> 43:03.093
I'm half irish
for fuck's sake.

43:04.914 --> 43:07.426
Anyway, isn't there some kind
of rule about drinking in hot tubs?

43:07.461 --> 43:10.130
Yes, there is.
It says "do it."

43:10.920 --> 43:12.695
I think that's a bald eagle.

43:14.923 --> 43:16.741
I once shot a bald eagle.

43:17.092 --> 43:19.205
Never forgiven myself for it.

43:19.929 --> 43:21.394
Why did you cheat on mom?

43:26.068 --> 43:28.402
Why did you have
to go and tell her?

43:28.437 --> 43:30.426
I didn't fucking tell her.

43:30.440 --> 43:32.651
Oh, come on, Adam,
it's 15 years ago.

43:32.686 --> 43:35.004
Surely, you've got the
balls to fess up to it by now.

43:35.039 --> 43:37.294
You know what? Believe
whatever you want. I know.

43:37.329 --> 43:39.246
You screwed me financially.

43:39.315 --> 43:43.057
You fucked up the family.
- Oh, I fucked up the family? - Yeah.

43:43.119 --> 43:45.571
You know what? Take some
responsibility for what you've done.

43:46.731 --> 43:47.789
You know, you go
around, you hurt people,

43:47.791 --> 43:50.430
you don't know how
it eats them up inside.

43:50.465 --> 43:52.331
Are you talking about yourself?

43:52.366 --> 43:55.697
Yes, of course I am! - Well, why
are you using the third person?

43:55.699 --> 43:57.693
Don't do that.
It's very confusing.

43:57.728 --> 44:00.332
Why am I even bothering
having a conversation with you?

44:00.367 --> 44:01.702
You're incapable of
talking like a human being

44:01.704 --> 44:04.996
because you're a hollow
husk of a man. - Just cool it.

44:05.031 --> 44:06.931
Just enjoy the evening.
- Oh, go fuck yourself

44:06.966 --> 44:09.976
Live in the world, not in your
own bloody head all the time!

44:28.731 --> 44:31.331
Son of a bitch.

44:32.848 --> 44:33.688
Jimmy, it's Adam.

44:33.723 --> 44:36.205
Hey, you don't
fuck with an angel.

44:36.240 --> 44:37.797
You trying to get us
on their shit list?

44:37.832 --> 44:39.366
Now I got to worry
about the stuntmen's union?

44:39.401 --> 44:40.772
Do you have any idea
what you're doing right now?

44:40.807 --> 44:42.516
Atticus did all that,
all right?

44:42.551 --> 44:44.278
He drugged me, then he
threw my phone out the window.

44:44.414 --> 44:48.249
You know what, Jimmy? You need to get
here now. - You gotta get your shit together!

44:48.251 --> 44:51.799
Sorry, I'm...
I'm at a dog show right now.

44:51.834 --> 44:52.519
There's a dog named
Mickey on my lap right now

44:52.521 --> 44:57.492
That smells like chanel,
and my nerves are frayed, man.

44:57.494 --> 45:00.369
Jack just called and said he's
inches away from replacing Atticus

45:00.404 --> 45:03.530
With Donald Sutherland
for God. - I like Donald Sutherland.

45:03.867 --> 45:06.767
What are you... whose side are you on?
Look, I booked him  on Charlie's show.

45:06.769 --> 45:09.814
It'll be good, the studio will see
it, and feel like everything is okay.

45:09.849 --> 45:12.472
Yeah, well, he's not okay, all right?
He's drinking like a madman.

45:12.474 --> 45:15.976
My god, then pull the bottle out of his mouth!
- And he's eating a bunch of sugar.

45:15.978 --> 45:18.895
Then feed him diabetic
cookies! - Look, Jimmy...

45:19.181 --> 45:21.816
There's a lot of uncertainty in
my life. I don't know if I can do this.

45:21.818 --> 45:23.284
Listen the only thing
you have to do,

45:23.286 --> 45:26.920
The only thing, is make sure
he gets there clean, sober and alive.

45:26.922 --> 45:30.490
My dog is missing a leg.
I got a three-legged dog

45:30.492 --> 45:32.941
and he's about to
compete in an obstacle course.

45:33.028 --> 45:35.805
A piece of the obstacle course is
literally him jumping through hoops.

45:35.840 --> 45:37.589
Hoop after hoop after hoop.

45:38.300 --> 45:40.797
Do you hear me?
Tell me you're gonna man up!

45:40.836 --> 45:43.830
All right, just get it done, okay?
Good-Bye. Good-Bye.

45:44.139 --> 45:46.636
I want another drink.

45:46.876 --> 45:49.908
Just get me another bottle.

45:50.045 --> 45:52.266
We don't have another drink.

45:54.583 --> 45:57.619
You're a rat.
You're a rat, you are.

45:57.654 --> 46:00.228
What goes on set,
stays on set.

46:00.263 --> 46:02.396
You ought to remember that.
If i teach you anything...

46:02.431 --> 46:05.092
If i teach you anything,
it's that. You're a rat.

46:05.094 --> 46:08.180
You're... go fucking...
go in a hole,

46:08.331 --> 46:09.899
Your rat hole.

46:37.059 --> 46:39.293
Age cannot wither her,

46:39.295 --> 46:42.630
Nor custom stale.

46:42.632 --> 46:44.030
Ah.

46:44.032 --> 46:46.900
I had my first kiss in this car.

46:46.902 --> 46:50.356
Ellie the makeup girl.
I was 15, she was 25.

46:50.391 --> 46:51.188
Yeah.

46:51.974 --> 46:55.147
I paid her a 100 $
to take your virginity.

46:55.510 --> 46:56.842
Wait, what?

46:57.347 --> 46:59.897
She told me
you chickened out.

47:00.949 --> 47:03.572
Bit rude considering
it was a gift.

47:05.922 --> 47:09.322
Come on, let's shit,
shower and shave.

47:09.525 --> 47:11.712
We're wasting daylight.

47:16.132 --> 47:19.967
Ah-ha!
Yeah, she's like a lion!

47:19.969 --> 47:22.082
Put them on the backseat.

47:32.581 --> 47:33.981
Oh, and just for the record,

47:35.291 --> 47:36.555
I did lose my virginity

47:36.952 --> 47:41.138
In the backseat of this
car with Ellie and Isabel.

47:44.159 --> 47:45.928
Yeah, that Isabel.

47:48.697 --> 47:51.932
Good God.

47:51.934 --> 47:55.675
Well, I never knew
that we crossed swords.

47:55.710 --> 47:59.472
With my Isabel? Ah.

47:59.474 --> 48:01.946
Nice work, saloon boy.

Shit.

48:53.663 --> 48:55.463
Hmm.

48:55.465 --> 48:58.465
You know, that might
qualify as the best shit of my life.

48:58.467 --> 49:00.467
Oh, Jesus, you're disgusting.
- Is that my phone?

49:00.469 --> 49:03.670
That is private and
very personal property.

49:03.672 --> 49:06.580
Clementine's not
picking up my calls.

49:07.275 --> 49:09.274
Well, she probably
doesn't want to talk to you.

49:09.478 --> 49:13.386
It wouldn't surprise me.
You did lie to her. - I didn't lie to her.

49:13.416 --> 49:14.649
No?

49:15.451 --> 49:17.495
It's complicated.
- All right.

49:18.353 --> 49:20.687
Well, look, you drive,
all right?

49:21.224 --> 49:25.118
That dump's exhausted me.
But don't get used to it.

49:34.369 --> 49:36.506
Seat belt.
- Fuck off.

49:41.244 --> 49:43.635
240 North van Buren.

49:43.713 --> 49:47.048
God, if this book could talk.
- Are you sure this is a good idea?

49:47.050 --> 49:49.275
Absolutely.
- Who is she?

49:49.418 --> 49:52.119
She was a caterer
on a serial killer movie I did

49:52.121 --> 49:55.261
to pay for the divorce you caused.
- Did you have sex with her?

49:55.490 --> 49:59.471
Does the pope have a balcony?
- Why'd I even ask? - Number 60.

50:00.589 --> 50:01.578
Great.

50:11.807 --> 50:14.708
Wow.
- Oh, this is so wrong.

50:14.710 --> 50:16.243
Oh, yeah.

50:16.778 --> 50:18.642
You wait till you see her.

50:19.514 --> 50:20.730
Hel...

50:24.653 --> 50:29.298
Oh, my god. What are you...
no, I never thought I'd see you again.

50:29.333 --> 50:31.719
Well, well, you're a sight for
sore eyes. - What is he doing? Mm!

50:31.754 --> 50:34.095
Whoa. - Hey. Uh, hello.
- This is my son, Adam.

50:34.097 --> 50:37.231
Remember? I told you
about him. - Oh, Adam, yes.

50:37.233 --> 50:40.633
Apple of your eye. Hi. - Did I
say that? - Yes, you did say that.

50:40.635 --> 50:43.704
No, I didn't.
- You did say that.

50:43.706 --> 50:45.639
Who are you?

50:45.641 --> 50:48.141
Christ, that's not mine is it?

50:48.143 --> 50:51.612
It? She is eight, And I
haven't seen you in 13 years.

50:51.614 --> 50:52.615
Oh, thank god.

50:54.483 --> 50:58.418
You married a damn fine beautiful
woman, D.D. Look at her. Look at her.

50:58.420 --> 51:01.856
Stop. - Oh, hey, now, ain't that the
truth? How do you know each other?

51:01.858 --> 51:04.559
Well, we worked...
- We were lovers.

51:10.233 --> 51:11.471
Shit.

51:12.534 --> 51:15.462
Look, I think
we should be honest.

51:15.637 --> 51:18.317
I try to be truthful
in my life, and...

51:18.574 --> 51:21.908
It was a long time ago,
but we lay together.

51:25.914 --> 51:28.662
You know, I am going
to go check on the food.

51:28.851 --> 51:31.248
Honey, Eliza, why don't
you come with me sweetie?

51:40.730 --> 51:43.898
Yeah, well...

51:43.900 --> 51:48.041
it takes a real man...

51:48.538 --> 51:51.409
to say what you
just said to me...

51:53.275 --> 51:54.817
in my own home.

51:58.914 --> 52:00.595
I respect that.

52:00.630 --> 52:02.186
And...

52:04.920 --> 52:07.921
I loved you in "Jive ass."

52:07.923 --> 52:11.425
Oh, wow!

52:11.427 --> 52:13.606
You're a generous man, D.D.

52:13.641 --> 52:16.472
Your father is one
talented bastard.

52:16.507 --> 52:17.770
Yeah.

52:17.805 --> 52:21.080
D.D., listen,
you're a man of the cloth.

52:21.115 --> 52:23.880
A deacon. Would you
let me pick your brains?

52:23.915 --> 52:27.062
Oh, by all means. - You see,
I'm on a quest, I'm on a journey,

52:27.097 --> 52:29.910
I'm trying
to get closer to God.

52:29.945 --> 52:32.579
I'm trying to
get inside God.

52:32.581 --> 52:34.782
God's a woman. - Yeah,
she may well be, but...

52:34.784 --> 52:37.671
Oh, she may well
be, huh? She is.

52:37.719 --> 52:40.119
What I'm really interested in

52:40.154 --> 52:43.653
Is whether you can
give me any advice

52:43.793 --> 52:46.247
Of the spiritual sort,

52:46.282 --> 52:48.808
I mean,
pearls before swine.

52:49.532 --> 52:51.031
Swine.

52:51.400 --> 52:54.057
I'd be very honored
to listen to it.

52:55.938 --> 52:58.606
Well...

52:58.608 --> 53:00.792
the spirit is like a river.

53:00.827 --> 53:03.333
And all you need to do

53:03.368 --> 53:06.847
is get out of its way and just
let that river flow through you.

53:06.849 --> 53:09.117
Just flow.
- Flow.

53:09.152 --> 53:11.099
That's all there is to it.

53:12.562 --> 53:15.465
You're a wise man. - No,
I'm just a man, just like you.

53:15.500 --> 53:17.793
I hope everyone likes steak.

53:18.027 --> 53:21.158
Oh, he's a vegetarian, but just
throw him some mashed potato.

53:21.193 --> 53:24.101
Oh, man, I never understood
vegetarians. - Nor me, D.D.

53:24.136 --> 53:27.568
This looks great.
Goodness me.

53:27.603 --> 53:28.984
I have to tell you,

53:29.538 --> 53:32.422
The road gives you
an appetite. - Yes.

53:32.507 --> 53:34.668
Bless, this food, oh, Lord,

53:34.703 --> 53:37.878
for our use,
and us to thy service,

53:37.880 --> 53:40.669
and keep us ever
mindful of those in need.

53:40.704 --> 53:45.140
And bless our new friends
you have brought to this table

53:45.175 --> 53:47.315
in love and friendship.

53:47.623 --> 53:50.612
In Jesus' name, amen.
- Amen. - Amen.

53:53.396 --> 53:54.918
We bow our heads,

53:54.953 --> 53:57.223
Great and all-knowing Father,

53:58.000 --> 54:00.377
to praise thee
for thy bounty,

54:00.412 --> 54:02.769
represented today

54:03.072 --> 54:06.089
as meat, mashed potato

54:06.641 --> 54:10.706
and sweet fruit.
Hosanna in the Highest.

54:10.741 --> 54:12.824
Amen.
- Amen.

54:13.815 --> 54:15.883
Tell me,

54:15.885 --> 54:20.654
is there a four
seasons or a red roof inn?

54:20.689 --> 54:22.928
Yes, we have a...
- No, no, no, no!

54:22.963 --> 54:24.633
You'll stay with us.

54:24.668 --> 54:27.690
No. No, we couldn't
possibly impose.

54:27.797 --> 54:30.563
The twins are over-nighting
at their friend Joel's house,

54:30.565 --> 54:33.924
so you can take their room.
- You have twins?

54:33.959 --> 54:38.220
Yes, twins.
- Age? - Oh, no, no.

54:38.255 --> 54:40.532
Oh, they're babies.
- Yes.

54:40.567 --> 54:42.268
Well...
- Yeah.

54:42.478 --> 54:45.349
That's enormously generous.

54:45.648 --> 54:48.798
He's your father, Adam.
Start acting like it.

54:49.085 --> 54:51.812
Just because he's your father
doesn't mean he has to be mine.

54:51.847 --> 54:55.088
I don't have time for your
chickenshit daddy issues, I'm getting...

54:55.090 --> 54:57.557
You need to open your
eyes to this whole paradigm

54:57.559 --> 55:01.138
I'm trying to lay out for you, which
is our father's the goddamn antichrist.

55:01.173 --> 55:03.130
Okay, I'm getting
married in a few days.

55:03.132 --> 55:06.400
Oh, you gotta go? - I gotta go.
- Fine, I don't care. I gotta go, I'm busy.

55:06.402 --> 55:08.051
I don't have time for this.

55:23.818 --> 55:26.619
I mean, those beds,
I hibernated like a bear.

55:26.621 --> 55:30.624
I didn't even turn over,
i was so comfy and cozy.

55:30.626 --> 55:32.495
Anybody would like
some fresh...

55:35.030 --> 55:38.798
What does "A.C." stand for?

55:38.800 --> 55:42.324
I believe it stands for anti-Christ, Eliza.
Can you pass the grits, please?

55:42.570 --> 55:43.795
Thank you.

55:48.143 --> 55:51.912
Your call has been forwarded to
an automatic voice messaging service.

55:53.849 --> 55:57.184
It's natural, isn't it, to be worried
about bringing a child  into this world

55:57.186 --> 56:00.160
where there's global warming,
there's overpopulation?

56:00.195 --> 56:04.406
I think those are just excuses. - Polar
bears floating around on tiny fucking icecaps,

56:04.441 --> 56:06.413
That's excuses? No, that's
down to your generation.

56:06.708 --> 56:08.317
Who am I, Henry Ford?

56:08.352 --> 56:11.428
I bet you voted for Ronald Reagan.
- I did not. He's a terrible actor.

56:11.463 --> 56:14.499
I didn't vote for him.
I've never voted for anybody.

56:14.534 --> 56:17.101
My God, your
apathy is unbelievable.

56:17.136 --> 56:18.880
Do you want
my advice or not?

56:19.742 --> 56:23.230
Fine. - Do what I do,
follow your true nature.

56:23.646 --> 56:28.272
You should take what you've
learned from Clammy and move on.

56:28.307 --> 56:31.098
I mean, we learn more
from our mistakes

56:31.133 --> 56:33.379
than from our
successes, you know?

56:33.414 --> 56:35.456
So what did you learn
from "Five day fuck"?

56:35.458 --> 56:38.279
Well, now, that was
a successful film,

56:39.061 --> 56:41.999
artistically speaking,
so I didn't learn very much.

56:43.062 --> 56:45.493
Keep your eye out for a pharmacy,
I need to buy some astringent.

56:46.428 --> 56:47.188
Why?

57:30.112 --> 57:32.344
Whoa, that's a big guy.

57:35.650 --> 57:37.631
You know, you could
learn something from him.

57:39.021 --> 57:40.560
He's larger than life,

57:40.789 --> 57:42.488
He's his own man...

57:43.291 --> 57:45.070
And he's jolly.
- Hey.

57:45.793 --> 57:47.653
He's a strongman
made of vegetables.

57:47.996 --> 57:51.645
Okay, I'll give you that.
- I don't give a fuck.

57:53.702 --> 57:55.758
Oh, God.

57:56.170 --> 57:59.390
I'm just trying to
cheer you up a bit!

57:59.675 --> 58:01.708
No, Samuel, this does
not count as a date.

58:01.710 --> 58:05.359
Really? - Adam, don't...
no, no, no, don't do that!

58:09.284 --> 58:10.781
Adam, stop that.

58:10.985 --> 58:14.212
Look, you don't throw
rocks at the giant!

58:20.996 --> 58:23.280
Oh, great! The tire's flat!

58:23.932 --> 58:27.260
Goddamn it, now we're stuck here.
- Well, how did that happen?

58:28.903 --> 58:30.876
You ran over these bottles.

58:31.940 --> 58:34.322
Well, what are they doing
in the middle of the road?

58:34.357 --> 58:37.392
Littering. Jesus, this
country. I mean...

58:38.047 --> 58:40.788
This is supposed to be
a national monument, I think.

58:40.983 --> 58:44.341
If it's not, it should be.
People should take care of it.

58:44.376 --> 58:47.930
Oh, my God.

58:50.960 --> 58:54.129
Why don't you look in the
glove box and get the manual?

58:54.862 --> 58:57.426
How the fuck don't you
know how to change a tire?

58:57.461 --> 59:00.084
I'm an actor, for fuck's sake.
I don't know anything.

59:00.768 --> 59:04.204
Someone literally gives me a
piece of paper at the end of each day

59:04.206 --> 59:07.660
to tell me what I'm doing
the next one. - There's no manual.

59:08.491 --> 59:11.418
Well, how come you can't change
a tire? You're not even famous.

59:11.453 --> 59:13.480
Because I didn't have
a father to teach me.

59:13.515 --> 59:15.682
Oh, boo-hoo.

59:15.684 --> 59:18.066
God, your generation,
you're so squishy.

59:18.954 --> 59:22.610
My father never told
me that... he loved me.

59:22.645 --> 59:25.065
Love?
That's hysterical.

59:25.100 --> 59:29.271
I would have settled for a birthday
card once in the last 15 years. - Oh, well,

59:29.306 --> 59:31.210
you've got your new
brother-In-law for that now.

59:31.300 --> 59:34.700
Well, there's no signal.
- Excuse me. Wait! Excuse me...

59:34.702 --> 59:37.538
Wait. Wait! - Go on,
catch him, catch him.

59:37.573 --> 59:39.762
Wait! Wait!

59:39.797 --> 59:42.055
Go on, Adam.
- Wait! Fuck!

01:00:09.737 --> 01:00:11.405
You guys okay?

01:00:11.407 --> 01:00:14.074
Hey.

01:00:14.076 --> 01:00:16.363
You all right?
- What? Jesus!

01:00:17.846 --> 01:00:19.863
You guys don't
have a spare tire.

01:00:20.014 --> 01:00:20.784
What?

01:00:22.317 --> 01:00:23.552
What do we do?

01:00:24.719 --> 01:00:27.101
I don't suppose you
could give us a lift

01:00:27.136 --> 01:00:28.959
into the next town
with a garage?

01:00:29.358 --> 01:00:33.419
Well, we're camping about five
miles up the road for the night.

01:00:33.454 --> 01:00:34.817
We can take you
in the morning.

01:00:35.831 --> 01:00:38.264
No, I think...
- Are you sleeping in tents?

01:00:38.266 --> 01:00:42.051
Yeah. - Uh, that'd
be fine, that'd be fine.

01:00:42.086 --> 01:00:44.602
That's perfect.
- Great. - Yeah.

01:00:44.637 --> 01:00:47.746
Yes. - How are you getting on with
that wheel? - I got it.  - You got it?

01:00:47.781 --> 01:00:50.490
Mm-Hmm. - Whoa, look
at that. We're in business.

01:00:51.012 --> 01:00:54.780
You're Atticus Smith.
- Yes. - Yes, you are.

01:00:54.782 --> 01:00:57.284
I dressed up as you in "Cops
and Slobbers" for Halloween.

01:00:57.286 --> 01:01:00.954
No. - Yeah. - I hope
nobody dressed up as Slobbers.

01:01:00.956 --> 01:01:02.714
Mind you, he's
a wonderful dog.

01:01:03.492 --> 01:01:06.226
Are you all right? - My boyfriend
dressed up as Slobbers. - Did he? - Yeah.

01:01:06.228 --> 01:01:08.907
Did he get the drool?
- Oh, he got the drool perfectly.

01:01:08.942 --> 01:01:12.026
We used lube.
- This is a great bus.

01:01:12.061 --> 01:01:15.101
Where'd you find it?
- We were on our way to SFO

01:01:15.103 --> 01:01:17.170
and we saw this old
hippie selling the bus, so...

01:01:17.172 --> 01:01:19.707
Yahoo bought our company last
year and we have all this money,

01:01:19.742 --> 01:01:21.074
So we figure we might as
well have a little fun with it.

01:01:21.076 --> 01:01:24.766
Why not? - If you know what
I mean. - Yolo, right?  - What?

01:01:24.801 --> 01:01:27.446
We spent four days at a
phreaker festival in the Salt Flats.

01:01:28.513 --> 01:01:31.284
It got weird. - Oh, well, I
wouldn't know anything about that,

01:01:31.286 --> 01:01:34.054
but what the hell?
- Who are these guys?

01:01:34.056 --> 01:01:37.580
That's Johnny. He owns
the company. He's exhausted.

01:01:37.615 --> 01:01:39.972
And this is wisdom,
he's our shaman.

01:01:40.896 --> 01:01:42.193
We're paying him.

01:02:05.788 --> 01:02:07.155
Fuck it.

01:02:09.358 --> 01:02:11.090
That's good.

01:02:11.092 --> 01:02:14.369
I think I'll just...

01:02:19.001 --> 01:02:22.304
stick to dewar's.
Haven't got any ice, have you?

01:02:22.938 --> 01:02:26.694
Soda water or anything?
- Atticus.

01:02:32.146 --> 01:02:34.733
Atticus.
- Oh, all right.

01:02:35.818 --> 01:02:38.958
Viva Carlos
Casta-fucking-Neda.

01:02:39.922 --> 01:02:41.561
Mmm.
- There they go.

01:02:41.596 --> 01:02:43.464
Whoo! Whoo!

01:02:44.827 --> 01:02:46.618
Hey! Hey!

01:02:51.132 --> 01:02:55.032
I see a corridor of fire.

01:02:55.067 --> 01:02:56.902
Right, right, good.
- I'm in a corridor of fire.

01:02:56.937 --> 01:02:59.746
Right, i want you, you
know, you need to run through that.

01:02:59.781 --> 01:03:01.537
You need to run through that.
- I think I'm changing.

01:03:02.311 --> 01:03:05.298
I might be an eagle.

01:03:05.347 --> 01:03:09.811
I think I'm an eagle.
- Beautiful. - I shot an eagle once.

01:03:11.018 --> 01:03:13.918
I ate it too. Don't
think I'll ever get over it.

01:03:15.123 --> 01:03:16.917
I'm in a black pit.

01:03:16.925 --> 01:03:20.594
I think this stuff's pretty weak.
- It's cold.  - I didn't feel a thing.

01:03:20.596 --> 01:03:23.195
What's that?

01:03:23.197 --> 01:03:25.761
Are those my feathers?
Have you taken my feathers?

01:03:25.796 --> 01:03:29.202
Have you been plucking me?
- No, those are your feathers.

01:03:34.275 --> 01:03:37.077
Are you okay? You want to sit down?
- No, no, no, it's good.  It's good.

01:03:37.079 --> 01:03:40.116
Do you want to swap seats?
- It's good. It's good.

01:03:40.151 --> 01:03:42.115
You know, I feel like...
- It's good.

01:03:42.583 --> 01:03:45.588
Do I need to sign something?
- You don't need to sign anything.

01:03:45.623 --> 01:03:46.747
You sure?
- I'm sure.

01:03:50.458 --> 01:03:53.361
Go on, little one.
- One, two, three.

01:03:54.663 --> 01:03:58.408
Not that you're not sexy, but
you're like my grandfather's age.

01:03:58.443 --> 01:04:01.198
Ah. - I didn't hurt your
feelings, did I? - No, no, no.

01:04:01.503 --> 01:04:03.831
I'm much too old
to have feelings.

01:04:19.253 --> 01:04:21.489
No, no, no.

01:04:36.003 --> 01:04:37.339
Okay.

01:04:44.211 --> 01:04:46.211
Well, that was a blast.

01:04:46.213 --> 01:04:49.014
Hope that sleeping kid
isn't dead.

01:04:49.016 --> 01:04:52.139
Oh, Atticus. - What?
- Can you take care of this?

01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:54.287
I got to call Clementine.

01:04:54.289 --> 01:04:56.788
Jesus, you're
gonna call her again?

01:04:56.823 --> 01:04:59.227
Yeah.
- Well, make it short, all right?

01:04:59.594 --> 01:05:02.153
And give me
your card. - Oh.

01:05:03.130 --> 01:05:04.632
How do you not
have any money?

01:05:05.367 --> 01:05:08.676
I'll get my accountant to send
you a check, all right? Will that do?

01:05:10.304 --> 01:05:12.719
Morning, gentlemen,
i got some work for you.

01:05:19.447 --> 01:05:21.317
Oh, God.

01:05:31.226 --> 01:05:33.518
Why are you calling me?
I told you not to.

01:05:33.553 --> 01:05:36.662
I know, I know. Look, Clem,
I've just been on this journey...

01:05:36.664 --> 01:05:38.692
Your urologist e-mailed.

01:05:40.768 --> 01:05:43.025
What, you broke into my e-mail?

01:05:43.338 --> 01:05:45.624
No, I'm using your computer
and the fucking thing dinged.

01:05:48.275 --> 01:05:51.204
What did it say?
- Something about an appointment.

01:05:51.380 --> 01:05:53.279
A follow-up appointment.

01:05:57.052 --> 01:06:00.387
Look, Clem... - You know, when we first
met, I loved how progressive you seemed.

01:06:00.389 --> 01:06:03.285
I realize now that you
just hide behind all of that.

01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:05.724
Hide...
- Uh, no, Adam, I know.

01:06:05.759 --> 01:06:07.967
Can you just listen to me...
- I know how your father hurt your mother

01:06:08.002 --> 01:06:10.195
And how you promised you would
never hurt anybody. I've heard all of that.

01:06:10.197 --> 01:06:14.061
I understand that, but listen to
me, please. - We're human, okay?

01:06:14.096 --> 01:06:16.568
Humans hurt each other.
Shit fucking happens!

01:06:16.570 --> 01:06:18.512
Fuck, I didn't want to
do this on the phone!

01:06:18.547 --> 01:06:20.721
Adam, I am trying to
edit my documentary.

01:06:20.756 --> 01:06:21.745
I know. - Do you
understand that?

01:06:21.780 --> 01:06:24.882
Look, I'm trying to explain
something to you. - They're gonna go...

01:06:25.179 --> 01:06:26.726
They're gonna go
and fetch the car.

01:06:26.815 --> 01:06:29.695
So, it'll be about an hour.
There's a bar down the road.

01:06:29.730 --> 01:06:32.244
I don't have time for another
one of your long Adam talks, okay?

01:06:32.279 --> 01:06:34.012
Why are you being
such a bitch?

01:06:39.193 --> 01:06:41.380
Okay, I'm sorry,
i didn't... i didn't mean that.

01:06:41.415 --> 01:06:42.662
By the way, you're
nothing like your father.

01:06:42.664 --> 01:06:44.296
He doesn't pretend to
be something he's not.

01:06:44.298 --> 01:06:47.231
Oh, he's honest?
Fuck y... I mean, fuck.

01:06:47.402 --> 01:06:51.849
I'm honest! I'm not pretending!
I'm not pretending to be... - I don't care.

01:06:51.884 --> 01:06:54.631
Adam, i don't care, okay? I don't
care if you cut your fucking balls off.

01:06:54.666 --> 01:06:56.205
It's not like you ever
had any to begin with.

01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:57.420
Oh, I don't have any balls?

01:06:57.846 --> 01:07:01.580
They're right here, sweetheart, under
my fucking dick! - Good-Bye, Adam.

01:07:01.615 --> 01:07:04.897
Good-bye? What do
you mean, "Good-bye?"

01:07:04.932 --> 01:07:07.304
It means good-bye.
- Like "good-bye" good-bye?

01:07:11.328 --> 01:07:12.363
Fuck!

01:07:12.398 --> 01:07:15.137
You know, I was supposed
to play the lead in "Cruising."

01:07:15.172 --> 01:07:16.994
But the studio saw my tests

01:07:17.029 --> 01:07:19.164
and they said I took
it too dark, too street.

01:07:19.166 --> 01:07:21.257
Double shot of
Jack Daniels bourbon, please.

01:07:22.269 --> 01:07:25.111
You just say "give me
a double shot of Jack",

01:07:25.146 --> 01:07:26.278
He'll know what you mean.

01:07:26.407 --> 01:07:29.342
I mean, I wanted you to
feel the stank on his chaps,

01:07:29.344 --> 01:07:30.432
you know what I mean?

01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:34.319
Anyway, they went for Pacino.

01:07:38.286 --> 01:07:39.741
All right, who wants to fuck?

01:07:40.722 --> 01:07:44.504
Adam, this is a gay bar.
- What? - No, thank you.

01:07:44.539 --> 01:07:47.671
Didn't you see the sign outside?
It's called  "The men's room."

01:07:47.706 --> 01:07:50.831
But don't let me stop
you, if that's your mood.

01:07:50.866 --> 01:07:53.397
Anyone want to take a
turn with my boy here?

01:07:53.432 --> 01:07:56.410
No! No, thank you.
- Honey, stop looking.

01:07:56.445 --> 01:07:58.403
You know I had to kiss
Ian McKellen on the lips

01:07:58.405 --> 01:08:00.773
every night for six
months in "Angels in America."

01:08:00.775 --> 01:08:04.810
and the strange thing
is, i got to quite like it.

01:08:05.847 --> 01:08:07.699
Old as the greeks.

01:08:07.757 --> 01:08:09.019
Same again, please.

01:08:10.359 --> 01:08:11.950
Oh, you're going for it.
What's the matter?

01:08:12.686 --> 01:08:14.237
She broke up with me.

01:08:14.422 --> 01:08:17.558
Who, Clammy?
I thought he already did.

01:08:19.493 --> 01:08:21.559
You know, she was the
only good thing in my life.

01:08:21.594 --> 01:08:23.725
The only good thing.
Now she's gone.

01:08:24.497 --> 01:08:28.249
Okay, it's my turn to drive.
My turn to drive.

01:08:28.502 --> 01:08:32.834
No, don't... don't... don't fuck
around. Don't...  get your hands off the...

01:08:33.439 --> 01:08:34.966
Come on!

01:08:37.810 --> 01:08:40.510
Jesus, don't do that in the car.

01:08:40.881 --> 01:08:44.270
Let me finish up.
- You'll get it all over the floor.

01:08:44.305 --> 01:08:47.001
This is a dream
liner, not a urinal.

01:08:47.354 --> 01:08:50.689
Oh, i spilled a bit.
Oh, Jesus!

01:08:50.692 --> 01:08:53.625
This place is like a pigsty.

01:08:53.627 --> 01:08:55.889
Didn't your mother
teach you anything?

01:08:57.698 --> 01:08:58.997
Piss on me.

01:09:01.301 --> 01:09:03.618
Cleanliness
is next to godliness.

01:09:04.270 --> 01:09:05.858
That's from the bible.

01:09:06.675 --> 01:09:09.709
Left here, left, left,
left. Left, hard left!

01:09:09.711 --> 01:09:12.319
All right, here we...
watch... here, right here.

01:09:12.354 --> 01:09:14.573
This is it.
This is it. Stop!

01:09:15.350 --> 01:09:17.683
This is it. We're here.
- Well, where the fuck is this?

01:09:17.685 --> 01:09:20.862
I thought we were on a schedule.
- The schedule can "s" my "d"!

01:09:20.921 --> 01:09:24.456
I'm taking you to a ball game.
- Ball game? - A ball game.

01:09:24.457 --> 01:09:28.455
Come on, death's almost on us. You
never took me, so I'm taking you, papa bear.

01:09:28.490 --> 01:09:31.703
All right, all right, all right!
- All right? - Shit, yeah!

01:09:31.738 --> 01:09:34.500
All right! - Come on! You get
some tickets, go to the ATM.

01:09:34.502 --> 01:09:36.578
All right.
- I'll park up. - All right.

01:09:41.309 --> 01:09:43.019
Hey, who's playing?

01:09:53.688 --> 01:09:57.257
Great shot. Look at
that man. Whoa!  - Whoa!

01:09:59.994 --> 01:10:02.644
He's got the ball! Go on!

01:10:02.679 --> 01:10:04.263
Kick it in the face!
- Go on you little four-legged angel.

01:10:04.265 --> 01:10:07.866
Go on, go on! - Shoot it.
- There you go. - Shoot it!

01:10:07.868 --> 01:10:09.723
Yes.
- Get it!

01:10:10.604 --> 01:10:12.537
Ladies and gentlemen,
it looks like we have

01:10:12.539 --> 01:10:14.874
legendary actor Atticus
Smith in the house.

01:10:14.876 --> 01:10:19.312
Come on up to the press
box and say hello, Atticus.

01:10:19.314 --> 01:10:22.014
I'm here with national
treasure Atticus Smith today.

01:10:22.016 --> 01:10:25.918
Atticus, you actually played
an alcoholic baseball coach

01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:29.755
In "bases loaded", if I remember
correctly. - You do remember correctly.

01:10:29.757 --> 01:10:34.494
And if I remember correctly,
it was a terrible film.

01:10:34.496 --> 01:10:35.961
To the fans out there,
I should tell you that

01:10:35.963 --> 01:10:38.430
Atticus is about to
get a new son-In-law,

01:10:38.432 --> 01:10:43.086
former Cubbies star pitcher, now
co-owner  of The Joliet slammers,

01:10:43.597 --> 01:10:46.255
Mark Keane. - Yeah. - That's
got to be exciting  for you guys.

01:10:46.290 --> 01:10:48.221
Oh, so exciting.
Do you have a daughter?

01:10:48.710 --> 01:10:50.766
Yes, she actually
just turned 12.

01:10:50.801 --> 01:10:53.100
Oh, well, would you
like her to be married

01:10:53.135 --> 01:10:56.581
to some fucking jock?
Yeah? Would you?

01:10:56.583 --> 01:10:57.983
I guess I haven't really
thought about it.

01:10:57.985 --> 01:11:00.363
Yeah, well, you think
about it for 21 years,

01:11:00.398 --> 01:11:02.514
and then you give me
a call. If I'm still around,

01:11:02.791 --> 01:11:06.088
I will pick up and we can
have a long conversation about it.

01:11:07.328 --> 01:11:11.369
Mark's a very beloved figure here.
- Yeah, well, that's what I keep hearing.

01:11:11.404 --> 01:11:14.021
"He's a beloved figure."
I mean, Jesus Christ.

01:11:14.056 --> 01:11:16.126
If he's such a beloved
figure in Chicago,

01:11:16.161 --> 01:11:19.502
why the fuck doesn't he
live in Chicago? He's a kiss-ass.

01:11:19.537 --> 01:11:22.407
A feisty day at the ballpark, and,
Atticus, thank you so much for joining us.

01:11:22.409 --> 01:11:26.604
It's been a pleasure. Let's go,
The slammers! - Kick their fucking ass!

What happened?
I don't remember anything.

01:12:36.707 --> 01:12:38.113
You blacked out.

01:12:41.155 --> 01:12:42.839
Why are we in jail?

01:12:44.792 --> 01:12:46.576

Come on, pull
yourself together.

01:12:56.837 --> 01:12:58.804
It's all right, it's all
right, all right, all right.

01:12:58.806 --> 01:13:01.278
They picked you up for
soliciting a couple of hookers.

01:13:01.943 --> 01:13:05.040
I came in to bail you out and they
got me on an intoxication charge.

01:13:05.075 --> 01:13:08.600
I cheated on Clemmy with
a hooker? - Shut the fuck up, man!

01:13:09.783 --> 01:13:13.018
You talk too much.
This ain't no private suite.

01:13:13.020 --> 01:13:17.079
Ain't that the truth.
He's a real chatterbox, aren't you?

01:13:17.114 --> 01:13:18.624
Man, I'm talking
about both of you,

01:13:18.626 --> 01:13:22.160
you Jon Bon Jovi
looking motherfucker.

01:13:22.162 --> 01:13:24.521
Why don't you
sit the fuck down

01:13:24.556 --> 01:13:27.030
before i stick you with
the shiv i snuck up in my ass?

01:13:30.171 --> 01:13:33.023
You think I'm afraid
of what you got up your ass?

01:13:33.058 --> 01:13:35.495
Oh, you want to
test me, short eyes?

01:13:36.810 --> 01:13:39.703
Okay, I don't know what
the fuck that means, okay?

01:13:39.881 --> 01:13:43.094
But I don't like it.
- Sorry, he gets a little excited.

01:13:43.585 --> 01:13:46.245
You're okay, come on.
Shh, shh, shh, you're all right.

01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:49.171
You're all right.
It's fine. It's cool.

01:13:49.206 --> 01:13:52.207
Just cool, man.
- Yeah. Shiv up your ass.

01:13:53.728 --> 01:13:55.791
That was good.
- Yeah.

01:13:56.230 --> 01:13:59.499
I was doing you
from "Cross bar motel."

01:13:59.501 --> 01:14:03.602
I thought I recognized it.
- Yeah, did I get all the lines right?

01:14:03.604 --> 01:14:06.348
Thought the lisp was
a bit heavy. - I know.

01:14:08.141 --> 01:14:11.675
I can't believe I cheated
on Clemmy. - With two hookers?

01:14:11.710 --> 01:14:13.881
You didn't cheat on anybody.

01:14:14.047 --> 01:14:15.954
You kept your dick clean.

01:14:16.117 --> 01:14:18.537
You thought they were
flight attendants, didn't you?

01:14:19.953 --> 01:14:21.985
How was I to know
they were cops?

01:14:22.020 --> 01:14:23.888
Come on.
- Oh, thank God.

01:14:25.032 --> 01:14:27.221
Keep it clean, douchebag.
- Is this the way out?

01:14:37.137 --> 01:14:40.039
Here's a telescope
profile of Gloria Steinem...

01:14:40.041 --> 01:14:43.241
her childhood,
her work, and her friends.

01:14:43.243 --> 01:14:47.149
... always ask me, you
know, "what kind of girl is she?

01:14:47.184 --> 01:14:48.852
She seems like a real bitch.

01:14:49.317 --> 01:14:52.318
Oh, she must be
very aggressive and pushy."

01:14:52.654 --> 01:14:54.887
You know, they have these
whole preconceived ideas

01:14:54.889 --> 01:14:58.638
of a girl who gets
to where gloria is in life...

01:15:02.130 --> 01:15:04.091
That's room service.
You want to get it?

01:15:09.970 --> 01:15:12.859
You know, we got
a long drive ahead.

01:15:13.207 --> 01:15:15.262
Do you want to
share this water?

01:15:15.297 --> 01:15:17.901
No, that's disgusting.
I'll take a shower.

01:15:17.936 --> 01:15:20.604
Hmm. I thought you
were a conservationist.

01:15:22.649 --> 01:15:24.653
You can set it
on the table, thanks.

01:15:34.761 --> 01:15:38.038
Annabel? - So, why has
dad gone fucking crazy?

01:15:38.099 --> 01:15:39.763
What are you talking
about? He's not going crazy.

01:15:40.033 --> 01:15:42.802
He publicly insulted
Mark in his hometown.

01:15:42.804 --> 01:15:44.159
Come on, you know dad.

01:15:44.694 --> 01:15:47.020
By the way, why did Mark
send him a birthday card?

01:15:47.055 --> 01:15:49.391
Okay, what? Who cares?

01:15:49.877 --> 01:15:52.606
Why are you letting
him ruin everything?

01:15:52.641 --> 01:15:54.291
Oh, come on, he
hasn't ruined everything.

01:15:54.391 --> 01:15:56.442
Yes! Mark's family
has gone berserk.

01:15:56.477 --> 01:15:59.250
Mark is even angry.
You know Mark does not get angry.

01:15:59.252 --> 01:16:03.940
Annabel, cut him some slack, all right?
- I can't have him here, not now.

01:16:04.626 --> 01:16:06.642
You want to disinvite
dad from the wedding now?

01:16:06.994 --> 01:16:10.062
No, I don't want
to, but I have to.

01:16:10.064 --> 01:16:12.634
Do you have any idea what
we've been through to get here?

01:16:13.868 --> 01:16:16.008
Put him on the
phone, okay? - No.

01:16:16.871 --> 01:16:19.087
No? What do you mean, no?

01:16:19.122 --> 01:16:22.879
He's sleeping. - What do
you mean he's sleeping?

01:16:22.914 --> 01:16:25.037
It's 5:00 p.m.
- Annabel...  - Fine.

01:16:25.072 --> 01:16:27.052
Then you can
tell him. Good-bye.

01:16:27.782 --> 01:16:30.293
I love these little
bottles of soap.

01:16:30.652 --> 01:16:32.556
They stop you getting crabs.

01:16:34.788 --> 01:16:37.389
Wait, who gets crabs anymore?

01:16:37.391 --> 01:16:40.577
I got crabs once.
From a carpet.

01:16:51.305 --> 01:16:54.176
<font color=#00FF80><b> <i># This is a song
about somebody else</i> </b></font>

01:16:56.109 --> 01:16:59.680
<font color=#00FF80><b> <i># So don't worry
yourself, worry yourself</i> </b></font>

01:17:02.182 --> 01:17:05.820
<font color=#00FF80><b> <i># The devil's right there,
right there in the details</i> </b></font>

01:17:12.193 --> 01:17:14.194
I don't know
what I'm trying to say.

01:17:18.032 --> 01:17:20.296
Well, you haven't
said anything.

01:17:22.470 --> 01:17:25.510
God, eight years
and it's all just bullshit.

01:17:26.940 --> 01:17:28.278
You mean the movie?

01:17:29.042 --> 01:17:31.477
"Seven angry women in
search of Damascus." - Everything.

01:17:31.479 --> 01:17:34.938
Me... my life...

01:17:36.061 --> 01:17:39.364
my sense of purpose...
all just nothing.

01:17:44.192 --> 01:17:46.044
I didn't tell mom.

01:17:47.693 --> 01:17:49.327
When I got back from
filming "Throwdown" with you,

01:17:49.329 --> 01:17:51.803
I just told her I didn't
want to be an actor anymore.

01:17:54.368 --> 01:17:57.407
She could see I was upset
about something, but I didn't tell her.

01:17:59.127 --> 01:18:00.216
I guess she just knew.

01:18:03.478 --> 01:18:04.795
Yeah.

01:18:09.868 --> 01:18:11.172
I can believe that.

01:18:13.820 --> 01:18:14.784
God.

01:18:15.783 --> 01:18:17.647
What do you want?
What do you want? I'll get it.

01:18:20.962 --> 01:18:23.291
Was that your i-pad
you just threw out?

01:18:23.326 --> 01:18:27.129
It doesn't mean anything.
I'm just a fucking fraud.

01:18:27.164 --> 01:18:28.449
None of it means anything.

01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:39.590
But it was an i-pad.
I haven't got an i-pad.

01:19:00.167 --> 01:19:03.789
Ah, right on time. - No,
you're about 30 minutes late.

01:19:03.824 --> 01:19:06.206
Good, listen, I've been saving
something... - Atticus, listen to me...

01:19:06.241 --> 01:19:08.461
No, wait, wait. I've
got something to tell you.

01:19:09.669 --> 01:19:11.461
These are your wheels.

01:19:11.496 --> 01:19:13.595
This car is your car.

01:19:14.582 --> 01:19:16.105
You mean in your will?

01:19:16.682 --> 01:19:19.393
No, no, no, I bought it for you
before we wrapped on "Throwdown."

01:19:19.428 --> 01:19:22.053
Just... I didn't have a
chance to give it to you

01:19:22.055 --> 01:19:24.372
before everything went
pear-shaped. Look, you see?

01:19:25.059 --> 01:19:26.652
All the documents
in your name.

01:19:27.328 --> 01:19:29.977
Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:19:30.163 --> 01:19:33.346
Oh, come on,
it's only a car.

01:19:33.568 --> 01:19:36.164
Why don't you go and
buy some wedding presents

01:19:36.270 --> 01:19:39.571
while I'm doing the show?
The margarita mixer or whatever it is.

01:19:39.573 --> 01:19:42.441
Blender. - Yeah, well,
whatever, as long as

01:19:42.443 --> 01:19:45.522
it's not the million-dollar
jam jars, I'm cool.

01:19:45.557 --> 01:19:48.529
Atticus, she doesn't
want you to come. - What?

01:19:49.917 --> 01:19:52.861
She doesn't want you
to come. - To the wedding?

01:19:52.953 --> 01:19:54.448
Yeah.

01:20:00.060 --> 01:20:04.057
You took it too far.
Mark and everything...

01:20:07.134 --> 01:20:11.071
But we were just joking around.
I mean, I've never met the guy. - I know.

01:20:11.106 --> 01:20:13.045
Annabel's just trying
to keep the peace.

01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:14.771
She thinks his parents
are freaking out.

01:20:15.309 --> 01:20:19.084
It's best for everybody if,
you know, you sit this one out.

01:20:24.669 --> 01:20:26.533
Look, she says she'll come visit
you straight after the wedding.

01:20:26.568 --> 01:20:27.322
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:20:30.457 --> 01:20:33.524
I get it. Sort of.

01:20:38.357 --> 01:20:40.405
Wait, you better
take my jacket.

01:20:41.135 --> 01:20:44.478
You can't turn up to the
rehearsal dinner in that piece of shit.

01:20:44.513 --> 01:20:45.646
They'll think you're a shmuck.

01:20:45.681 --> 01:20:47.664
Actually, you should
probably take mine, too.

01:20:48.175 --> 01:20:50.954
If you go in wearing a feminist
t-shirt, Charlie will have a heart attack.

01:20:50.989 --> 01:20:51.886
Uh-huh.

01:20:53.213 --> 01:20:54.782
Enjoy the car.

01:21:40.226 --> 01:21:42.249
You've just turned 70.

01:21:42.284 --> 01:21:45.573
Thank you
for telling everybody.

01:21:45.599 --> 01:21:48.381
You played such a wide
assortment of roles,

01:21:48.416 --> 01:21:50.589
and now you're about
to play God. - Yeah.

01:21:50.624 --> 01:21:54.199
What I mean is, have
you reached the level that

01:21:54.234 --> 01:21:57.253
you've known or hoped
that you could reach?

01:21:58.145 --> 01:22:01.701
Yes. - You've been
famous for most of your life.

01:22:01.736 --> 01:22:03.922
It must be difficult.
- Well, you know,

01:22:03.984 --> 01:22:07.346
every job has its pluses
and minuses, you know that.

01:22:07.381 --> 01:22:09.620
But walking down the street,
eating in restaurants,  is it...

01:22:09.622 --> 01:22:13.147
I've just discovered
fast food restaurants.

01:22:13.182 --> 01:22:16.461
You must be kidding me. - No,
no, I'm not. I'm being serious.

01:22:16.463 --> 01:22:20.844
I drove here
from L.A. with my son...

01:22:20.879 --> 01:22:23.568
and everywhere you go, there
are these fast food restaurants.

01:22:23.570 --> 01:22:27.338
And they're terrific. - You drove
across the United states with your son?

01:22:27.373 --> 01:22:28.761
Yeah.
- Why?

01:22:34.081 --> 01:22:36.668
Because my heart is shot...

01:22:38.118 --> 01:22:40.374
because I'm
probably an alcoholic,

01:22:40.409 --> 01:22:42.987
and I could drop
dead at any minute...

01:22:44.457 --> 01:22:46.509
and my doctors
wouldn't let me fly.

01:22:51.532 --> 01:22:53.713
I really don't blame
you for not wanting him here.

01:22:53.748 --> 01:22:56.501
I certainly don't. - Mom,
calm down. - I'm calm, okay?

01:23:13.154 --> 01:23:16.828
Hey, I'll be back in a
second. - Okay. - Is it time?

01:23:52.092 --> 01:23:56.129
Mm, God. - So, what?
- Oh, Jesus!

01:23:56.164 --> 01:23:57.575
You were never gonna
have the operation?

01:23:57.610 --> 01:23:59.200
Ah.

01:24:00.835 --> 01:24:04.167
You never told me that
you had ballsack cancer.

01:24:05.206 --> 01:24:07.266
Testicular.
- Whatever.

01:24:07.675 --> 01:24:09.756
How the hell did you know?

01:24:09.777 --> 01:24:11.346
How did I know?

01:24:15.216 --> 01:24:19.370
Privacy really is dead. You're
like the fucking NSA. - Look, Adam...

01:24:19.405 --> 01:24:21.359
Atticus...
- No, wait, listen to me.

01:24:21.622 --> 01:24:23.391
I've given this
a lot of thought.

01:24:23.426 --> 01:24:26.055
If I do croak...

01:24:29.497 --> 01:24:31.435
I want you
to have my nuts.

01:24:32.132 --> 01:24:34.264
It doesn't work like that.

01:24:34.299 --> 01:24:36.694
I know they're bigger, but they
can probably make them fit.

01:24:36.729 --> 01:24:38.808
The pet scan
came back negative.

01:24:39.305 --> 01:24:41.507
I'm fine. They just have
to remove the one testicle.

01:24:41.509 --> 01:24:44.922
Oh, Jesus, God.
- No, no, that's good news.

01:24:44.957 --> 01:24:48.873
I thought the cancer had spread.
They say I'm gonna be fine now.

01:24:50.751 --> 01:24:53.178
Oh, well,
that is good news.

01:24:54.188 --> 01:24:57.624
Uni-ball, eh? Ha!
- Oh, Jesus.

01:24:57.925 --> 01:24:59.458
You've been worrying
about this all the time,

01:24:59.460 --> 01:25:01.165
and you should've told me.

01:25:02.462 --> 01:25:05.396
You certainly should've
told Clementine.

01:25:05.431 --> 01:25:07.199
Yeah, I know.
I wanted to.

01:25:07.201 --> 01:25:08.962
God, i wanted to.

01:25:11.538 --> 01:25:15.122
I was scared.
- Hmm.

01:25:18.039 --> 01:25:19.334
Why didn't you
take your pills?

01:25:20.648 --> 01:25:23.214
Because they told me
I couldn't fuck on them.

01:25:23.216 --> 01:25:26.021
Oh, Jesus, dad, there's
more to life than fucking.

01:25:26.056 --> 01:25:27.443
I'm not sure about that.

01:25:29.923 --> 01:25:33.070
But it all goes by so fast.

01:25:34.461 --> 01:25:38.455
I can't believe that it...
it might be over.

01:25:39.300 --> 01:25:41.315
So, what? You were
just gonna do nothing?

01:25:41.435 --> 01:25:43.972
I just want more time.

01:25:45.372 --> 01:25:46.422
I know.

01:25:49.976 --> 01:25:51.710
What are you doing here?

01:25:52.313 --> 01:25:55.846
Have they thrown you out of the
wedding, too? - I came back to get you.

01:25:56.917 --> 01:25:59.031
She doesn't want me there.

01:26:01.255 --> 01:26:02.834
Well, come on.

01:26:04.304 --> 01:26:05.653
When has that
ever stopped you?

01:26:09.430 --> 01:26:12.777
Where'd you get this tux?
- Why? You like it?

01:26:12.812 --> 01:26:14.208
No, it's a piece of shit.

01:26:14.243 --> 01:26:17.110
You look like a
maitre d'. Come on.

01:26:17.145 --> 01:26:20.606

Hey, why don't we
make an entrance, eh?

01:26:33.327 --> 01:26:35.853
Take the roof off.
Bloody sports car.

01:26:35.855 --> 01:26:36.854
Okay, slow down.

01:27:02.048 --> 01:27:05.886
Good luck.
- Yeah, uh...

01:27:07.354 --> 01:27:08.489
Okay.

01:27:10.524 --> 01:27:11.593
Mm-hmm,
mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

01:27:34.581 --> 01:27:36.447
Sorry we're late, sweetheart.

01:27:36.449 --> 01:27:39.084
I...

01:27:39.086 --> 01:27:41.919
I can't be...
I'll be right back.

01:27:41.921 --> 01:27:43.688
Okay, I'll be right here.

01:27:43.690 --> 01:27:45.863
I know you told me
not to come, but...

01:27:46.327 --> 01:27:49.741
I'll probably be dead in a
fortnight, so I thought what the hell?

01:28:02.975 --> 01:28:05.589
You're a wonderful,
forgiving person

01:28:06.646 --> 01:28:09.739
And that makes me worry that
you're not a good judge of character.

01:28:09.774 --> 01:28:12.817
What?
- This guy... this guy Mark.

01:28:12.819 --> 01:28:15.086
Is he full of shit?
- No.

01:28:15.088 --> 01:28:17.968
I mean, does he deserve you?

01:28:18.725 --> 01:28:22.032
Yes.
- Really?

01:28:22.067 --> 01:28:24.983
Yes. - Really?
- Yes, dad. I'm marrying him.

01:28:26.567 --> 01:28:29.867
Well, I mean, I know your...

01:28:29.869 --> 01:28:32.380
your mum's husband's
probably a nice guy, but...

01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:37.541
You're my only daughter.

01:28:37.543 --> 01:28:40.024
I want to be the one
to take you down the aisle.

01:28:55.162 --> 01:28:57.564
All right, you got
everything? - Yeah.

01:28:58.966 --> 01:29:01.859
Yeah.
- You okay?

01:29:27.728 --> 01:29:29.827
Nice to meet you.

01:29:29.829 --> 01:29:32.496
You've met before.
Several times.

01:29:32.498 --> 01:29:35.099
Have I? - Yeah.
- Hi.  - Oh.

01:29:35.101 --> 01:29:37.343
Say you're sorry.
- What?

01:29:37.378 --> 01:29:38.325
"Sorry."

01:29:40.006 --> 01:29:41.309
All right, I'm sorry.

01:29:43.476 --> 01:29:47.035
You take care of her or I'll
bust your balls, all right? - Hmm.

01:29:51.083 --> 01:29:53.554
Hi, Dorothy.
- Piss off.

01:29:54.787 --> 01:29:55.821
Welcome!

01:29:58.792 --> 01:30:01.058
Okay, slugger!

01:30:01.060 --> 01:30:03.569
Let's see
what you can do, huh?

01:30:03.796 --> 01:30:06.665
Ha-ha! Ah!

01:30:06.667 --> 01:30:08.503
Oh!

01:30:10.636 --> 01:30:13.205
Home run.
- Hey.

01:30:13.207 --> 01:30:14.909
Good God, who's that?

01:30:16.710 --> 01:30:19.646
Oh, God.
- What?

01:30:28.921 --> 01:30:30.657
Excuse me.

01:30:40.934 --> 01:30:43.835
Hey, come and dance with me?

01:30:43.837 --> 01:30:46.838
Yes. - Yes,
leave your old man.

01:30:46.840 --> 01:30:48.876
Don't give a fuck about him.

01:30:51.110 --> 01:30:53.644
Well, it hasn't spread,
That's the most important thing.

01:30:53.646 --> 01:30:56.929
Oh, really?
- I'm so sorry I didn't tell you.

01:30:57.083 --> 01:30:59.048
Why didn't you
fucking tell me?

01:30:59.083 --> 01:31:01.133
He was about to fire
you. I had to talk him down.

01:31:01.168 --> 01:31:03.621
Yeah, you know,
Jimmy, you can tell Jack

01:31:03.657 --> 01:31:06.578
to shove "God"
up his capacious ass.

01:31:06.827 --> 01:31:09.628
Really? - Yeah. - I mean, it's
a miracle he still even wants you.

01:31:09.630 --> 01:31:13.231
No, I... If I have to
have this fucking operation,

01:31:13.266 --> 01:31:14.843
if I survive, then...

01:31:16.036 --> 01:31:20.204
I just want to do decent stuff.
I don't want  to do crap, okay?

01:31:23.010 --> 01:31:26.121
Yeah, fuck him.
- All right. Bye.

01:31:32.719 --> 01:31:33.988
Happy?

01:31:35.756 --> 01:31:36.990
Yeah.

01:31:39.326 --> 01:31:40.842
Thank you, by the way.

01:31:43.063 --> 01:31:44.317
What for?

01:31:45.666 --> 01:31:49.532
She told me you called her.
- How could I have called her?

01:31:49.567 --> 01:31:51.704
You've had my
fucking phone all week.

01:31:52.305 --> 01:31:55.417
Been so long, I've forgotten
how to use it. - No, of course.

01:31:58.679 --> 01:31:59.811
So, what, you're
not gonna play God?

01:31:59.813 --> 01:32:02.047
Nah, the script stinks.

01:32:03.182 --> 01:32:05.646
I'd much prefer to
play the devil anyway.

01:32:06.720 --> 01:32:09.581
Take it over
to the dark side.

01:32:10.591 --> 01:32:12.324
Good.

01:32:12.326 --> 01:32:14.662
Yeah, it's good, I think.

01:32:16.762 --> 01:32:19.697
You know...

01:32:19.699 --> 01:32:22.299
You should go
and comfort her...

01:32:24.027 --> 01:32:25.546
before somebody else does.

01:32:26.273 --> 01:32:29.352
Me, for example.

01:32:36.015 --> 01:32:37.551
Hey, hey, hey.

01:32:41.921 --> 01:32:44.024
Careful, tiger.
Careful, careful, careful.

01:33:02.809 --> 01:33:03.811
Hey.

01:33:08.414 --> 01:33:10.281
I love you.

01:33:10.283 --> 01:33:12.753
What?

01:33:17.858 --> 01:33:19.025
Nothing.
