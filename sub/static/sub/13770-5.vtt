WEBVTT

00:12.387 --> 00:15.056
Come on, we can't.

00:12.387 --> 00:15.056
We'll wake up the baby.

00:15.098 --> 00:17.768
That is what

00:15.098 --> 00:17.768
old reliable is for.

00:17.810 --> 00:19.144
(romantic soul music playing)

00:19.186 --> 00:23.565
Besides, babies at this age

00:19.186 --> 00:23.565
don't remember anything.

00:25.024 --> 00:27.152
(romantic soul music continues)

00:35.577 --> 00:39.039
♪ Life is unfair. ♪

00:40.374 --> 00:42.334
LOIS:

00:40.374 --> 00:42.334
What is wrong with you?

00:42.376 --> 00:44.043
You two ruin everything.

00:44.085 --> 00:45.838
Look what you've done

00:44.085 --> 00:45.838
to this shirt.

00:45.880 --> 00:47.589
You saw the price tag,

00:45.880 --> 00:47.589
and you knew

00:47.631 --> 00:48.590
I'd just bought it.

00:48.632 --> 00:50.091
This has become a daily event.

00:50.133 --> 00:53.094
She actually pays more attention

00:50.133 --> 00:53.094
to them than to us.

00:53.136 --> 00:54.596
(loud clang)

00:54.638 --> 00:56.640
Maybe that's not a bad thing.

00:58.141 --> 01:01.562
Do you think I can afford

00:58.141 --> 01:01.562
to keep on buying new clothes?

01:01.603 --> 01:03.146
Oh, honey, come on.

01:01.603 --> 01:03.146
Hey. Enough is enough.

01:03.188 --> 01:05.774
Look, I want you to go out and

01:03.188 --> 01:05.774
buy a new washer and dryer.

01:05.816 --> 01:07.442
You know we can't afford that.

01:07.484 --> 01:09.110
Look, I wasn't going

01:07.484 --> 01:09.110
to say anything yet,

01:09.152 --> 01:11.112
but you know all those

01:09.152 --> 01:11.112
crappy stock options

01:11.154 --> 01:13.114
I've been getting

01:11.154 --> 01:13.114
instead of bonuses?

01:13.156 --> 01:16.035
Well, I think they're finally

01:13.156 --> 01:16.035
going to be worth something.

01:16.076 --> 01:19.079
There have been people flying

01:16.076 --> 01:19.079
back and forth to New York

01:19.120 --> 01:20.998
and all these

01:19.120 --> 01:20.998
closed-door meetings.

01:21.040 --> 01:23.417
I think that merger is

01:21.040 --> 01:23.417
finally going through.

01:23.458 --> 01:26.628
Oh, Hal, that

01:23.458 --> 01:26.628
would be wonderful.

01:26.670 --> 01:28.630
Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad.

01:28.672 --> 01:30.215
Don't want to be late

01:28.672 --> 01:30.215
for school today.

01:30.257 --> 01:31.717
I'm handing in my diorama.

01:49.443 --> 01:50.819
No, no, no!

01:50.861 --> 01:52.487
16 weeks of

01:50.861 --> 01:52.487
Intermediate Psychology,

01:52.529 --> 01:55.240
and you can't classify

01:52.529 --> 01:55.240
a simple test case?

01:55.282 --> 01:58.493
I thought at least your ears

01:55.282 --> 01:58.493
were functional, Kenarban.

01:58.535 --> 02:03.331
I know castration complex

01:58.535 --> 02:03.331
when I see it.

02:03.373 --> 02:06.710
I'm trying to get you

02:03.373 --> 02:06.710
to go beyond convenient labels.

02:06.752 --> 02:07.878
To quote Blake,

02:07.920 --> 02:10.422
"To generalize is to be a fool."

02:10.464 --> 02:12.049
Idiot.

02:10.464 --> 02:12.049
Excuse me?

02:12.091 --> 02:15.010
Blake wrote, "To generalize

02:12.091 --> 02:15.010
is to be an idiot."

02:15.970 --> 02:17.638
Thank you, Malcolm.

02:15.970 --> 02:17.638
(bell rings)

02:17.679 --> 02:19.098
Tomorrow, people, I want

02:19.139 --> 02:21.182
progress reports on

02:19.139 --> 02:21.182
your term projects.

02:21.224 --> 02:24.061
I have to talk to Herkabe for

02:21.224 --> 02:24.061
a second. Will you wait up?

02:24.103 --> 02:25.186
Got gym.

02:25.228 --> 02:27.064
Have to change...

02:27.106 --> 02:28.273
my tires.

02:30.233 --> 02:33.528
Mr. Herkabe, you still haven't

02:30.233 --> 02:33.528
given me my term project.

02:33.570 --> 02:35.489
I've been asking you

02:33.570 --> 02:35.489
every day for a month.

02:35.530 --> 02:37.157
Malcolm, you make it

02:35.530 --> 02:37.157
sound like I'm trying

02:37.198 --> 02:38.241
to sabotage your impeccable

02:37.198 --> 02:38.241
grade-point average.

02:38.283 --> 02:39.743
Please just give me something

02:39.785 --> 02:41.202
so I can get started.

02:39.785 --> 02:41.202
All right, tell you what.

02:41.244 --> 02:42.871
Why don't you come by

02:41.244 --> 02:42.871
my office at lunch

02:42.913 --> 02:44.123
and I'll give you

02:42.913 --> 02:44.123
your assignment.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.791
Your office?

02:45.833 --> 02:48.961
Why is everybody so

02:45.833 --> 02:48.961
afraid of my office?

02:50.504 --> 02:52.089
A reminder,

02:50.504 --> 02:52.089
class officer ballots

02:52.131 --> 02:53.799
can be picked up

02:52.131 --> 02:53.799
at the registrar's office.

02:53.841 --> 02:55.216
JV basketball practice

02:55.258 --> 02:56.969
will again be held

02:55.258 --> 02:56.969
in the auxiliary gym.

02:57.011 --> 02:59.596
Oh, and Patty Lin committed

02:57.011 --> 02:59.596
a Code Nine in the library

02:59.638 --> 03:01.222
and is hereby suspended.

03:01.264 --> 03:03.976
(plays sprightly tones)

03:04.018 --> 03:06.937
I trust the stick

03:04.018 --> 03:06.937
of gum was worth it.

03:08.772 --> 03:11.190
Ah, Malcolm.

03:08.772 --> 03:11.190
You have waited

03:11.232 --> 03:13.234
very patiently

03:11.232 --> 03:13.234
for your term project,

03:13.276 --> 03:16.321
and today your patience

03:13.276 --> 03:16.321
pays off.

03:17.280 --> 03:18.239
Here.

03:18.281 --> 03:19.574
What's this?

03:19.616 --> 03:21.242
You are holding a video

03:19.616 --> 03:21.242
surveillance camera.

03:21.284 --> 03:24.913
The lens is in the logo,

03:21.284 --> 03:24.913
and the video is transmitted

03:24.955 --> 03:28.125
via wireless signal

03:24.955 --> 03:28.125
to this digital tape recorder.

03:28.167 --> 03:29.793
What am I supposed

03:28.167 --> 03:29.793
to do with it?

03:29.835 --> 03:31.252
You are going

03:29.835 --> 03:31.252
to secretly conduct

03:31.294 --> 03:34.756
an in-depth case study

03:31.294 --> 03:34.756
of a deviant mind,

03:34.798 --> 03:37.425
the most deviant mind

03:34.798 --> 03:37.425
that we have at our disposal.

03:37.467 --> 03:39.803
A mind incapable

03:37.467 --> 03:39.803
of differentiating

03:39.845 --> 03:41.262
between right and wrong,

03:39.845 --> 03:41.262
a diseased...

03:41.304 --> 03:44.058
You're talking about my brother.

03:41.304 --> 03:44.058
Yes.

03:44.099 --> 03:46.309
And you want me

03:44.099 --> 03:46.309
to secretly videotape him?

03:46.351 --> 03:48.311
Around you, he'll relax,

03:46.351 --> 03:48.311
let his guard down,

03:48.353 --> 03:50.022
begin to talk about himself.

03:50.064 --> 03:53.775
These disciplinary files reveal

03:50.064 --> 03:53.775
nothing of the real Reese.

03:53.817 --> 03:55.276
What you're asking me to do

03:55.318 --> 03:57.278
is creepy on about

03:55.318 --> 03:57.278
a hundred different levels.

03:57.320 --> 03:59.948
You have one week.

03:59.990 --> 04:02.367
The newspaper is here.

04:02.409 --> 04:03.952
The newspaper

04:02.409 --> 04:03.952
is here.

04:03.994 --> 04:05.746
The newspaper is here.

04:05.787 --> 04:08.082
You know those come

04:05.787 --> 04:08.082
out every day, right?

04:08.123 --> 04:09.666
No, no, today is the day

04:09.708 --> 04:12.460
our review appears

04:09.708 --> 04:12.460
in the Lifestyle section.

04:12.502 --> 04:14.755
Charles Cutler himself came out.

04:14.796 --> 04:16.297
He only does the biggies.

04:16.339 --> 04:19.259
Francis, you read it--

04:16.339 --> 04:19.259
I'm too nervous.

04:24.347 --> 04:27.308
"A visit to the Grotto

04:24.347 --> 04:27.308
raises many questions,

04:27.350 --> 04:29.061
"foremost among them,

04:29.103 --> 04:31.271
"how could a kind and loving God

04:31.312 --> 04:33.815
grant these monsters

04:31.312 --> 04:33.815
a hotel license?"

04:33.857 --> 04:35.316
PIAMA: "From the

04:33.857 --> 04:35.316
swinish cretins

04:35.358 --> 04:38.319
"posing as staff members

04:35.358 --> 04:38.319
up to and including

04:38.361 --> 04:41.364
"cuisine that would

04:38.361 --> 04:41.364
embarrass an orphanage,

04:41.406 --> 04:43.200
"the Grotto is quite simply

04:43.242 --> 04:46.286
the worst hotel in the

04:43.242 --> 04:46.286
history of the world."

04:49.330 --> 04:53.334
I'm sorry. I was so nervous,

04:49.330 --> 04:53.334
I wasn't even listening.

04:53.376 --> 04:54.920
Start again.

05:03.095 --> 05:04.345
Hey, have you seen

05:03.095 --> 05:04.345
Dewey anywhere?

05:04.387 --> 05:06.347
I want to try

05:04.387 --> 05:06.347
something out on him.

05:06.389 --> 05:09.059
No. So, uh, how are you?

05:09.101 --> 05:10.269
Huh?

05:10.310 --> 05:14.355
I'm just curious

05:10.310 --> 05:14.355
how you're feeling.

05:14.397 --> 05:15.816
How the hell should I know?

05:15.857 --> 05:17.442
Well, are you happy?

05:17.484 --> 05:19.069
Are you sad?

05:19.903 --> 05:21.362
Like, when you laugh,

05:21.404 --> 05:22.614
you're feeling that

05:21.404 --> 05:22.614
something's funny.

05:22.656 --> 05:23.907
Like when I tripped Arthur Hall

05:23.949 --> 05:25.826
and his retainer

05:23.949 --> 05:25.826
went flying out of his mouth

05:25.867 --> 05:27.619
into a pile of dog crap?

05:25.867 --> 05:27.619
That was awesome.

05:27.661 --> 05:30.705
So you think it's funny

05:27.661 --> 05:30.705
when other people get hurt?

05:30.747 --> 05:33.500
I think it's funny

05:30.747 --> 05:33.500
when you shut up.

05:33.541 --> 05:35.460
Okay. Okay.

05:35.502 --> 05:37.378
Hey, they laugh at me.

05:39.464 --> 05:40.841
People laugh at you?

05:40.882 --> 05:42.676
Yeah, people laugh at me.

05:42.717 --> 05:43.969
But not for long.

05:44.011 --> 05:46.638
So, what you're saying is,

05:46.680 --> 05:49.266
when people laugh

05:46.680 --> 05:49.266
at you, it hurts,

05:49.308 --> 05:51.350
and then you want

05:49.308 --> 05:51.350
to make them hurt, too?

05:52.602 --> 05:54.353
No. What I'm saying is,

05:54.395 --> 05:57.524
if you want to talk

05:54.395 --> 05:57.524
like a girl, go find a girl--

05:57.565 --> 05:59.400
and take this with you.

05:59.442 --> 06:00.443
(Malcolm grunts)

06:00.485 --> 06:02.321
(Malcolm groans softly)

06:02.361 --> 06:04.781
See? It is funny.

06:02.361 --> 06:04.781
MALCOLM: Ow.

06:04.823 --> 06:06.407
LOIS:

06:04.823 --> 06:06.407
The 4400 has

06:06.449 --> 06:08.076
the dual-speed rinse cycle?

06:08.118 --> 06:10.912
Mm-hmm. No. No, I placed

06:08.118 --> 06:10.912
my order four days ago.

06:10.954 --> 06:12.998
I just like talking about it.

06:14.916 --> 06:16.293
Hi, Dewey. How was school?

06:16.335 --> 06:17.418
Good. Great.

06:17.460 --> 06:18.586
I was definitely there.

06:18.628 --> 06:20.421
Eight times five-- 40.

06:20.463 --> 06:21.464
What are you...?

06:21.506 --> 06:22.716
(phone ringing)

06:22.757 --> 06:24.176
Hello?

06:24.218 --> 06:26.678
Hi, honey.

06:24.218 --> 06:26.678
What have you heard?

06:26.720 --> 06:28.555
You're kidding.

06:28.596 --> 06:29.973
Well, who was at the meeting?

06:30.015 --> 06:31.183
HAL:

06:30.015 --> 06:31.183
Everybody.

06:31.225 --> 06:32.684
People have been running

06:31.225 --> 06:32.684
in and out

06:32.726 --> 06:34.311
of the boardroom all day.

06:34.353 --> 06:36.188
No, I've just

06:34.353 --> 06:36.188
been playing Tetris.

06:36.230 --> 06:38.397
Oop. Here he comes.

06:43.820 --> 06:45.488
Hal.

06:45.530 --> 06:47.949
Mr. Fortinberry.

06:47.991 --> 06:51.410
Could you pull my jacket

06:47.991 --> 06:51.410
up over my head?

06:52.620 --> 06:54.206
Sure.

07:12.807 --> 07:14.935
Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.

07:14.976 --> 07:16.270
It's unbelievable.

07:16.311 --> 07:18.646
The whole company

07:16.311 --> 07:18.646
is under investigation.

07:18.688 --> 07:20.481
They used the pension fund

07:20.523 --> 07:23.360
to buy a recording studio

07:20.523 --> 07:23.360
for the CEO's girlfriend.

07:23.402 --> 07:25.737
Oh, Hal, this is horrible.

07:25.779 --> 07:28.073
Okay, okay. Don't

07:25.779 --> 07:28.073
worry about this.

07:28.115 --> 07:30.200
We're going to figure

07:28.115 --> 07:30.200
this out somehow.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.870
(sighs)

07:33.912 --> 07:35.747
(speed-dialing)

07:35.789 --> 07:37.874
Hello, Gene, it's Lois.

07:37.916 --> 07:42.837
Order 387669289-1--

07:42.879 --> 07:45.590
I'm afraid I have to cancel.

07:45.632 --> 07:46.758
Great.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.302
The Flagstaff Elks

07:48.343 --> 07:49.886
just canceled

07:48.343 --> 07:49.886
their convention here.

07:49.928 --> 07:51.054
Who can blame them?

07:51.096 --> 07:52.431
That review was horrible.

07:52.472 --> 07:53.640
Hey, Otto.

07:53.681 --> 07:56.517
How's it going? We going to get

07:53.681 --> 07:56.517
out of the robe today?

07:56.559 --> 07:59.271
Innkeeper of the Year?

07:59.313 --> 08:00.397
Hmm.

08:00.439 --> 08:03.108
It is the lie of the century.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.028
Otto, what are you doing?

08:07.070 --> 08:08.613
You worked hard for that award.

08:08.655 --> 08:09.781
What was that, Francis?

08:09.823 --> 08:10.907
I couldn't hear you

08:10.949 --> 08:14.494
over the crackle

08:10.949 --> 08:14.494
of my failure.

08:23.253 --> 08:25.464
I have dreams

08:23.253 --> 08:25.464
where I sing.

08:25.505 --> 08:28.549
Really high, like that

08:25.505 --> 08:28.549
Saturday Night Fever  guy.

08:28.591 --> 08:30.135
Okay.

08:30.177 --> 08:34.097
Well, you were sort of asking me

08:30.177 --> 08:34.097
about, you know, stuff.

08:34.139 --> 08:36.099
I thought you

08:34.139 --> 08:36.099
wanted to know.

08:36.141 --> 08:38.143
I do want to know.

08:38.185 --> 08:39.560
Is your head cold?

08:39.602 --> 08:40.603
Mine is.

08:40.645 --> 08:42.563
No. It's okay.

08:44.274 --> 08:46.443
So, you were singing

08:44.274 --> 08:46.443
in this dream?

08:46.485 --> 08:47.568
Yeah.

08:47.610 --> 08:49.488
And there were all

08:47.610 --> 08:49.488
these clouds around me.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.114
You like clouds?

08:51.156 --> 08:52.366
Yeah, I like clouds.

08:52.407 --> 08:54.575
I call them sky kittens.

08:54.617 --> 08:56.453
This is so weird.

08:56.495 --> 08:58.455
I've never told any

08:56.495 --> 08:58.455
of this to anyone.

08:58.497 --> 09:00.581
It's like you're

08:58.497 --> 09:00.581
another wishing hole.

09:00.623 --> 09:02.250
What's a wishing hole?

09:02.292 --> 09:03.918
You don't have a wishing hole?

09:02.292 --> 09:03.918
No.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.462
Oh, man, you got to get one.

09:05.504 --> 09:07.130
Mine's in a tree

09:05.504 --> 09:07.130
on Jefferson Street.

09:07.172 --> 09:09.299
You can ask your wishing hole

09:07.172 --> 09:09.299
for anything.

09:09.341 --> 09:12.593
It never calls you

09:09.341 --> 09:12.593
stupid or perv.

09:12.635 --> 09:14.637
My hole always

09:12.635 --> 09:14.637
keeps my wishes safe.

09:14.679 --> 09:16.681
It's like a bank for wishes.

09:18.350 --> 09:19.976
It's extraordinary footage.

09:20.018 --> 09:21.269
Yeah, but I only got it

09:21.311 --> 09:22.479
by doing something

09:21.311 --> 09:22.479
totally dishonest.

09:22.521 --> 09:23.771
I'm not doing

09:22.521 --> 09:23.771
this anymore.

09:23.813 --> 09:25.857
What?

09:23.813 --> 09:25.857
Why would you stop now

09:25.899 --> 09:27.567
when you could go

09:25.899 --> 09:27.567
so much deeper?

09:27.608 --> 09:28.902
He took me to his wishing hole.

09:28.943 --> 09:29.944
Malcolm,

09:29.986 --> 09:31.654
he wants to talk to you.

09:31.696 --> 09:32.864
Be his friend.

09:32.906 --> 09:34.991
He trusted me, and

09:32.906 --> 09:34.991
I exploited him.

09:35.033 --> 09:36.535
That's called

09:35.033 --> 09:36.535
being a good interviewer.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.995
It's called being a liar.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.995
He's my brother.

09:39.037 --> 09:40.621
I'm not giving you

09:39.037 --> 09:40.621
another assignment.

09:40.663 --> 09:42.707
Fine. I'll just make up

09:40.663 --> 09:42.707
the class in summer school.

09:42.749 --> 09:44.751
But I quit.

09:46.127 --> 09:48.171
(instrumental music plays)

10:03.686 --> 10:07.607
(grunting)

10:14.739 --> 10:17.700
(applause and cheering)

10:17.742 --> 10:20.661
(gasping)

10:20.703 --> 10:23.206
(bells jingling)

10:23.248 --> 10:26.167
(applause and cheering)

10:30.713 --> 10:33.716
There are... 50 kinds...

10:33.758 --> 10:36.677
of negative...

10:36.719 --> 10:39.013
trans...

10:39.055 --> 10:41.433
ference.

10:44.060 --> 10:45.686
Starting with...

10:45.728 --> 10:47.355
Well done, Stevie.

10:47.397 --> 10:49.816
I think we can all just

10:47.397 --> 10:49.816
fill in the blanks from there.

10:57.740 --> 11:01.369
Now, we have just enough time

10:57.740 --> 11:01.369
for one more presentation.

11:01.411 --> 11:03.455
And our friend Malcolm

11:03.497 --> 11:06.416
is going to amaze us

11:03.497 --> 11:06.416
with a fascinating update

11:06.458 --> 11:08.168
of the Milgram Experiment.

11:08.209 --> 11:09.586
Milgram Experiment?

11:09.628 --> 11:12.046
Oh, something

11:09.628 --> 11:12.046
you don't know, Malcolm.

11:12.088 --> 11:13.714
The Milgram Experiment

11:13.756 --> 11:15.383
was a lesson

11:13.756 --> 11:15.383
in the power of authority.

11:15.425 --> 11:17.594
A subject was asked

11:15.425 --> 11:17.594
by a man in a lab coat

11:17.636 --> 11:20.639
to administer an electric shock

11:17.636 --> 11:20.639
to a third party.

11:20.679 --> 11:23.266
Milgram proved

11:20.679 --> 11:23.266
that people will blindly

11:23.308 --> 11:25.393
follow an authority figure

11:25.435 --> 11:28.855
even if it means

11:25.435 --> 11:28.855
harming an innocent stranger.

11:28.896 --> 11:30.607
What are you doing?

11:28.896 --> 11:30.607
In our version,

11:30.649 --> 11:33.734
the stranger will be replaced

11:30.649 --> 11:33.734
by a close family member.

11:33.776 --> 11:35.820
And the electric shock

11:33.776 --> 11:35.820
will be replaced

11:35.862 --> 11:39.324
by devastating emotional trauma.

11:39.366 --> 11:40.825
Let's watch.

11:41.826 --> 11:43.744
Yeah, I like clouds.

11:43.786 --> 11:46.289
I call them sky kittens.

11:47.123 --> 11:48.667
It's troubling, isn't it?

11:48.707 --> 11:50.793
How willing someone is

11:48.707 --> 11:50.793
to sell out his own brother,

11:50.835 --> 11:52.879
knowing full well

11:50.835 --> 11:52.879
that it's exactly that kind

11:52.920 --> 11:54.422
of juicy gossip

11:52.920 --> 11:54.422
that would compel

11:54.464 --> 11:56.007
each of you to run into the quad

11:56.049 --> 11:58.759
and spread this throughout

11:56.049 --> 11:58.759
the school like wildfire.

11:58.801 --> 11:59.760
Hey, that is not...

11:59.802 --> 12:00.845
Malcolm, I am teaching.

12:00.887 --> 12:02.639
(tape squealing)

12:02.681 --> 12:04.765
It's called being a liar.

12:04.807 --> 12:05.766
He's my brother.

12:05.808 --> 12:07.227
And I exploited him.

12:07.268 --> 12:08.769
A liar.

12:07.268 --> 12:08.769
He's my brother.

12:08.811 --> 12:11.356
And I exploited him.

12:11.398 --> 12:13.274
You never said

12:11.398 --> 12:13.274
you were taping me.

12:13.316 --> 12:16.735
I never said I was taping him.

12:17.404 --> 12:18.946
(tape squealing)

12:20.490 --> 12:24.494
I wish Malcolm

12:20.490 --> 12:24.494
and I will be friends forever.

12:29.290 --> 12:30.500
Breathtaking, isn't it?

12:30.542 --> 12:32.293
Now, none of us can know

12:32.335 --> 12:34.671
if we would do that

12:32.335 --> 12:34.671
to a loved one just because

12:34.713 --> 12:37.090
a man in a proverbial lab coat

12:34.713 --> 12:37.090
asked us to.

12:37.131 --> 12:39.884
All we can know for certain...

12:39.926 --> 12:42.303
is that Malcolm did.

12:44.639 --> 12:45.806
Tomorrow, Katy reports

12:45.848 --> 12:47.808
on post-traumatic

12:45.848 --> 12:47.808
stress disorder in fruit flies.

12:54.148 --> 12:56.401
Hey! You made me look

12:54.148 --> 12:56.401
like a total jerk!

12:56.443 --> 12:57.193
You tricked me!

12:57.235 --> 12:59.028
Tricked you? Oh, how could I,

12:59.070 --> 13:02.657
a humble school administrator

12:59.070 --> 13:02.657
making low five figures,

13:02.699 --> 13:04.409
be any match

13:02.699 --> 13:04.409
for the great

13:04.451 --> 13:06.286
and powerful Malcolm?

13:06.327 --> 13:07.995
Never underestimate

13:06.327 --> 13:07.995
your adversary!

13:08.037 --> 13:10.498
You may consider yourself my

13:08.037 --> 13:10.498
moral and intellectual superior,

13:10.540 --> 13:13.042
but this has clearly proven

13:10.540 --> 13:13.042
you are neither.

13:14.043 --> 13:16.837
We played the game and I won.

13:16.879 --> 13:18.256
(engine starts)

13:18.298 --> 13:20.841
(engine dies)

13:20.883 --> 13:23.470
(starter chugging)

13:28.933 --> 13:30.893
Well, it looks as if

13:28.933 --> 13:30.893
neither of us

13:30.935 --> 13:33.896
is going anywhere for a while.

13:33.938 --> 13:36.857
Perhaps I said some things

13:36.899 --> 13:39.902
that you may have taken

13:36.899 --> 13:39.902
the wrong way.

13:39.944 --> 13:43.156
Anyway, I bought you something.

13:43.197 --> 13:45.742
Name-brand fabric softener.

13:45.784 --> 13:47.535
Oh, look at this.

13:47.577 --> 13:49.870
Our chief financial officer

13:47.577 --> 13:49.870
had his dog

13:49.912 --> 13:51.080
on the board of directors.

13:51.122 --> 13:53.874
I had to cc him

13:51.122 --> 13:53.874
on every memo.

13:53.916 --> 13:54.875
Mom, Dad,

13:54.917 --> 13:56.544
I have a question about school.

13:56.586 --> 13:58.797
Let's say you're making

13:56.586 --> 13:58.797
a lot of money.

13:58.837 --> 13:59.880
I mean,

13:58.837 --> 13:59.880
so much money

13:59.922 --> 14:01.882
that the idea

13:59.922 --> 14:01.882
of going to school is...

14:01.924 --> 14:03.050
You have

14:01.924 --> 14:03.050
to go to school.

14:03.092 --> 14:03.968
But what if you're

14:03.092 --> 14:03.968
already making,

14:04.010 --> 14:05.886
like, $400 or $500 a week?

14:05.928 --> 14:06.887
Yeah, Dewey,

14:06.929 --> 14:07.972
you start making

14:06.929 --> 14:07.972
$400 or $500 a week,

14:08.014 --> 14:09.265
you can quit school.

14:09.307 --> 14:11.392
Okay.

14:26.949 --> 14:29.285
This is an official apology.

14:29.327 --> 14:33.707
I'm a terrible person

14:29.327 --> 14:33.707
and I'm sorry.

14:33.748 --> 14:35.916
What I did was horrible

14:33.748 --> 14:35.916
even by our standards.

14:35.958 --> 14:36.959
And let's face it,

14:37.001 --> 14:38.795
we've set the bar

14:37.001 --> 14:38.795
pretty low.

14:38.837 --> 14:39.920
Look, I'm begging you.

14:39.962 --> 14:43.174
Tell me what I can do

14:39.962 --> 14:43.174
to fix it, anything.

14:43.216 --> 14:45.385
Just, just say it

14:43.216 --> 14:45.385
and I'll do it.

14:45.426 --> 14:47.178
Sure.

14:47.220 --> 14:48.929
Fly backwards around the Earth

14:47.220 --> 14:48.929
like Superman

14:48.971 --> 14:50.348
and turn back time

14:50.390 --> 14:52.642
to before I thought

14:50.390 --> 14:52.642
we liked each other.

14:55.019 --> 14:56.103
I still can't believe

14:56.145 --> 14:57.731
you convinced the newspaper

14:57.772 --> 14:59.190
to give us another review.

14:59.232 --> 15:00.941
Honey, you of all people know

14:59.232 --> 15:00.941
how persuasive I can be.

15:00.983 --> 15:02.569
You cried.

15:02.610 --> 15:03.986
Like a baby.

15:04.028 --> 15:05.112
He is here!

15:05.154 --> 15:07.490
Everyone, act normal!

15:09.992 --> 15:12.453
Welcome to the Grotto.

15:12.495 --> 15:15.415
Ah, the Grotto.

15:15.456 --> 15:18.877
Upon entering, one wonders

15:15.456 --> 15:18.877
which of the five senses

15:18.918 --> 15:20.961
is most brutally

15:18.918 --> 15:20.961
violated.

15:21.003 --> 15:23.964
Did you have a nice drive up?

15:24.006 --> 15:27.468
Sight and smell immediately

15:24.006 --> 15:27.468
burst into the lead

15:27.510 --> 15:31.472
as the obsequious innkeeper

15:27.510 --> 15:31.472
offers his sweaty slab of a hand

15:31.514 --> 15:33.808
like a bear taught

15:31.514 --> 15:33.808
to be friendly

15:33.850 --> 15:35.184
in hopes of a sugar cube.

15:35.226 --> 15:37.144
Mr. Cutler, if you would

15:35.226 --> 15:37.144
just give us a chance...

15:37.186 --> 15:40.022
And the pleading vultures

15:37.186 --> 15:40.022
immediately begin to circle.

15:40.064 --> 15:43.568
Their outlet mall attire

15:40.064 --> 15:43.568
creating such a vortex

15:43.610 --> 15:46.987
of misery that one loses

15:43.610 --> 15:46.987
the strength to even ask

15:47.029 --> 15:48.406
for a parking validation.

15:48.448 --> 15:49.824
I'll take that

15:48.448 --> 15:49.824
for you, sir.

15:49.866 --> 15:54.203
In a pathetic nod to diversity,

15:54.245 --> 15:57.206
they trot out

15:54.245 --> 15:57.206
the token native employee.

15:57.248 --> 15:59.626
Uh, that's my wife.

15:59.667 --> 16:04.004
Not content to merely ruin

15:59.667 --> 16:04.004
the vacations

16:04.046 --> 16:05.214
of a single generation,

16:05.256 --> 16:08.593
some of the employees

16:05.256 --> 16:08.593
decide to mate and breed.

16:08.635 --> 16:11.011
The mind reels, the thought

16:08.635 --> 16:11.011
of an endless stream

16:11.053 --> 16:15.057
of baboon-like hoteliers spewed

16:11.053 --> 16:15.057
out of the loins of the...

16:15.099 --> 16:17.101
Otto, I'm sorry.

16:15.099 --> 16:17.101
I don't know what happened.

16:17.143 --> 16:19.061
It was like someone else

16:17.143 --> 16:19.061
was punching him.

16:19.103 --> 16:21.188
Yeah, it was me.

16:21.230 --> 16:23.023
Here's some of his hair

16:23.065 --> 16:26.110
if you need to put it

16:23.065 --> 16:26.110
on ice or something.

16:26.152 --> 16:28.237
One recalls

16:26.152 --> 16:28.237
fiercer butt-kickings

16:28.279 --> 16:30.949
meted out

16:28.279 --> 16:30.949
on a preschool playground.

16:30.990 --> 16:33.033
The wounds are superficial,

16:33.075 --> 16:35.745
the bruising patterns

16:33.075 --> 16:35.745
unpersuasive.

16:35.787 --> 16:39.039
And never before has one seen

16:35.787 --> 16:39.039
such a grotesque ceiling.

16:39.081 --> 16:40.750
And frankly,

16:39.081 --> 16:40.750
blue is not your...

16:40.792 --> 16:43.586
(all gasp)

16:56.098 --> 16:57.684
Hey, there's Mr. Curtis!

16:57.725 --> 17:02.438
See, he's using Pete the muffin

16:57.725 --> 17:02.438
guy as a human shield.

17:02.480 --> 17:03.773
Come on.

17:03.815 --> 17:07.443
There's just a pair

17:03.815 --> 17:07.443
of socks in there.

17:07.485 --> 17:09.654
What are you doing?

17:07.485 --> 17:09.654
(shatters)

17:09.696 --> 17:10.738
(gasps)

17:10.780 --> 17:12.406
Oh, my God!

17:13.407 --> 17:15.368
Look at all this money.

17:15.409 --> 17:18.746
Hal, when did you

17:15.409 --> 17:18.746
hide this in here?

17:18.788 --> 17:19.914
HAL:

17:18.788 --> 17:19.914
I don't remember.

17:19.956 --> 17:21.374
It must have been

17:19.956 --> 17:21.374
years ago.

17:22.291 --> 17:23.793
Is this my Jet Ski fund?

17:23.835 --> 17:26.379
No, no. We used that to get the

17:23.835 --> 17:26.379
remote control out of Reese.

17:26.420 --> 17:28.923
There's got to be like

17:26.420 --> 17:28.923
a thousand dollars!

17:28.965 --> 17:31.091
$1,473.

17:31.133 --> 17:32.259
Who cares what

17:31.133 --> 17:32.259
it's from!

17:32.301 --> 17:33.302
Thank God it's here!

17:33.344 --> 17:35.722
You're a part

17:33.344 --> 17:35.722
of this moment, son.

17:35.763 --> 17:39.726
Here, buy yourself

17:35.763 --> 17:39.726
a pack of baseball cards.

17:46.607 --> 17:47.274
Ow!

17:47.316 --> 17:49.276
Why'd you do that?

17:49.318 --> 17:50.737
Why you do that?!

17:50.778 --> 17:52.112
Fight, fight, fight!

17:52.154 --> 17:53.113
(all chanting):

17:52.154 --> 17:53.113
Fight, fight, fight!

17:53.155 --> 17:54.824
(chanting continues)

17:57.660 --> 17:59.453
Animals.

18:12.258 --> 18:15.762
Hello, North High students.

18:12.258 --> 18:15.762
This is Malcolm.

18:15.803 --> 18:18.222
You all know the horrible thing

18:15.803 --> 18:18.222
I did to my brother Reese.

18:18.264 --> 18:20.767
And I'd like

18:18.264 --> 18:20.767
to publicly apologize

18:20.808 --> 18:22.769
for turning him

18:20.808 --> 18:22.769
into a laughingstock.

18:22.810 --> 18:26.439
I should never have exposed

18:22.810 --> 18:26.439
his secrets.

18:26.480 --> 18:28.232
And I can't turn back time.

18:28.274 --> 18:32.152
I can, however,

18:28.274 --> 18:32.152
level the playing field.

18:32.194 --> 18:34.572
I have been

18:32.194 --> 18:34.572
having impure thoughts

18:34.614 --> 18:37.157
about Shirley the lunch lady.

18:37.199 --> 18:38.158
(laughter)

18:38.200 --> 18:39.159
Last month, I caught a glimpse

18:39.201 --> 18:40.578
of her cleavage

18:40.620 --> 18:43.372
and I've been fantasizing

18:40.620 --> 18:43.372
about her ever since.

18:43.414 --> 18:45.750
And now that I've admitted that,

18:45.792 --> 18:48.628
I'm just as big a laughingstock

18:45.792 --> 18:48.628
as he is.

18:48.669 --> 18:50.546
Unfortunately,

18:48.669 --> 18:50.546
that doesn't protect him

18:50.588 --> 18:52.632
from the rest of the school.

18:52.673 --> 18:55.718
So I'm forced to bring everyone

18:52.673 --> 18:55.718
down to our level.

19:01.307 --> 19:03.101
Let's take a look

19:01.307 --> 19:03.101
at everyone's

19:03.142 --> 19:04.184
permanent records.

19:04.226 --> 19:05.686
First up,

19:05.728 --> 19:07.187
David Abernathy.

19:07.229 --> 19:09.189
He wasn't on a construction crew

19:07.229 --> 19:09.189
this summer.

19:09.231 --> 19:11.651
He was in theater camp.

19:11.692 --> 19:12.192
(laughter)

19:12.234 --> 19:13.193
Cheryl Adams

19:13.235 --> 19:14.779
is excused from gym this week

19:14.821 --> 19:16.614
because her herpes

19:14.821 --> 19:16.614
is flaring up.

19:16.656 --> 19:20.576
Charlie Agnew wets his bed

19:16.656 --> 19:20.576
every night during finals.

19:20.618 --> 19:24.204
Leslie Albert forged her

19:20.618 --> 19:24.204
parents' signatures

19:24.246 --> 19:25.372
to get a nose job.

19:25.414 --> 19:27.875
Well, Mr. Zyzyx, I'd say

19:25.414 --> 19:27.875
we have a half an hour

19:27.917 --> 19:30.210
to erase everything

19:27.917 --> 19:30.210
on your hard drive.

19:30.252 --> 19:31.420
James Allen...

19:33.673 --> 19:37.051
James Allen, he likes

19:33.673 --> 19:37.051
to eat his...

19:40.262 --> 19:41.388
What's all this?

19:41.430 --> 19:43.223
Did you see the paper!

19:41.430 --> 19:43.223
It is wonderful!

19:43.265 --> 19:45.225
He actually gave us

19:43.265 --> 19:45.225
a good review?

19:45.267 --> 19:46.268
There is no review.

19:46.310 --> 19:49.480
They bumped it for a much

19:46.310 --> 19:49.480
more interesting story.

19:49.522 --> 19:52.232
"Crazed local attacks reviewer"?

19:52.274 --> 19:54.276
But what's with

19:52.274 --> 19:54.276
all the flowers?

19:54.318 --> 19:57.237
They are thank-yous from

19:54.318 --> 19:57.237
restaurants and hotels

19:57.279 --> 19:58.447
and art galleries.

19:58.489 --> 20:01.325
Charles Cutler is the most

19:58.489 --> 20:01.325
hated man in the state.

20:01.367 --> 20:04.244
And look at these room

20:01.367 --> 20:04.244
reservations.

20:04.286 --> 20:07.289
Other hotels

20:04.286 --> 20:07.289
have sent us their overflow.

20:07.331 --> 20:09.542
We are booked solid

20:07.331 --> 20:09.542
through May.

20:09.583 --> 20:11.251
I can't believe this guy.

20:11.293 --> 20:13.253
He actually reviewed

20:11.293 --> 20:13.253
the hospital.

20:13.295 --> 20:15.422
Oh, yeah, it sounds terrible.

20:15.464 --> 20:17.466
I'm never going there.

20:21.012 --> 20:24.264
If you overload it,

20:21.012 --> 20:24.264
you'll burn out the motor.

20:24.306 --> 20:27.267
You're only supposed

20:24.306 --> 20:27.267
to use two caps of...

20:27.309 --> 20:29.269
Aw, just let me do it.

20:31.313 --> 20:33.566
Well, I served my three weeks

20:31.313 --> 20:33.566
suspension,

20:33.607 --> 20:36.276
and I got to say

20:33.607 --> 20:36.276
things have really changed.

20:36.318 --> 20:37.862
I think I might have created

20:37.904 --> 20:40.280
the most polite high school

20:37.904 --> 20:40.280
in America.

20:45.912 --> 20:47.872
For the most part.

20:47.914 --> 20:49.456
Hey, plagiarizer.

20:49.498 --> 20:51.458
Hey, pukes-after-she-eats.

20:51.500 --> 20:54.879
Hey, dad-had-a-breakdown-

20:51.500 --> 20:54.879
'cause-mom-went-lesbian.

20:54.921 --> 20:58.216
He actually has an amazing

20:54.921 --> 20:58.216
memory for this kind of stuff.
