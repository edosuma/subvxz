00:02.169 --> 00:03.086
Previously on 90210:

00:03.211 --> 00:04.338
I'm Dixon.
I'm Sasha.

00:04.463 --> 00:05.547
What do you do
for a living?

00:05.673 --> 00:07.341
I'm in the music business.

00:07.466 --> 00:08.634
Who is that
white woman,

00:08.759 --> 00:11.470
and why is she hugging
your boyfriend?

00:11.595 --> 00:13.639
(tires screech)

00:13.764 --> 00:15.724
You know that homeless guy
that was killed

00:15.850 --> 00:16.767
in hit-and-run?
His nephew goes here.

00:16.892 --> 00:18.226
That's him.

00:18.352 --> 00:19.561
Jasper, wait.

00:19.687 --> 00:20.729
I'll go for a ride with you.

00:20.855 --> 00:22.063
You will?

00:22.189 --> 00:22.773
Naomi is your sister?

00:22.898 --> 00:24.358
Naomi will never

00:24.483 --> 00:25.609
(on recording):
believe that we slept together.

00:31.031 --> 00:32.031
I think we've waited
long enough.

00:33.575 --> 00:37.245
(both moaning)

00:37.371 --> 00:41.333
♪ Hey, big daddy,
what ya doing tonight? ♪

00:41.458 --> 00:42.501
♪ Got so many honeys... ♪

00:42.626 --> 00:45.629
Hey, Janine!

00:45.754 --> 00:48.590
Hey-hey, Jordan, my man!

00:48.716 --> 00:51.635
Oh, cool kicks, Alisa. Wow!

00:51.760 --> 00:53.303
(makes gunshot sound)

00:53.428 --> 00:55.681
And, Natalie, way to work
that Bunsen burner in lab.

00:55.806 --> 00:58.350
Shazam!

00:58.475 --> 00:59.768
Hey, man.

00:59.894 --> 01:03.355
Mr. Wong just slammed me
with all kinds of homework.

01:03.480 --> 01:05.105
(laughs)

01:05.232 --> 01:07.442
Dude, that was not funny.

01:07.568 --> 01:09.110
Oh, I was just thinking
about something

01:09.236 --> 01:10.404
Adrianna said
to me last night,

01:10.529 --> 01:12.322
you know, after
we did it.

01:12.447 --> 01:14.533
(laughs)

01:14.658 --> 01:15.784
Right. Of course.

01:15.910 --> 01:17.828
Hey, hey,
what's the word?

01:17.953 --> 01:19.371
You guys have
a good weekend?

01:19.496 --> 01:21.540
Oh, yeah. Finally have a way
to get Naomi back.

01:21.665 --> 01:23.458
You serious?

01:23.584 --> 01:24.543
DIXON:
How?

01:24.668 --> 01:25.794
Come on.

01:25.920 --> 01:27.588
Dude, he doesn't want
to talk about it,

01:27.713 --> 01:29.130
all right?
Leave him alone.

01:29.256 --> 01:31.258
So my weekend was
pretty awesome, too.

01:31.383 --> 01:32.217
Oh, yeah, how come?
No reason.

01:32.342 --> 01:33.594
Why, do I seem different
or something?

01:36.221 --> 01:38.807
Homeboy finally got laid.
NAVID: Geez, dude,

01:38.933 --> 01:41.309
what's up with that?
I was trying to keep
it on the down low.

01:41.435 --> 01:43.478
But since the cat's out
of the bag, it's true.

01:43.604 --> 01:45.522
This guy no longer a virgin.

01:45.647 --> 01:47.566
Holla! Yeah!

01:47.691 --> 01:49.317
Finally talked Ade into it, huh?

01:49.443 --> 01:51.319
No, I didn't have to talk her
into anything.

01:51.445 --> 01:53.238
She just came back
from Beach Club on Friday,

01:53.363 --> 01:54.615
and she could not keep
her hands off me.

01:54.740 --> 01:55.657
She showed up all,

01:55.783 --> 01:56.784
"I want you, Navid."

01:56.909 --> 01:58.702
So I gave the girl
what she wants.

01:58.827 --> 02:00.161
Gave her what she wants!

02:00.287 --> 02:01.496
Put your hand down.

02:01.622 --> 02:03.331
You've reached
your high five limit.

02:03.457 --> 02:04.666
Really?
Yeah.

02:04.792 --> 02:06.835
You know what?
We should go on a double date.

02:06.961 --> 02:08.419
Hmm?

02:08.544 --> 02:09.503
Yeah, you and Ade

02:09.630 --> 02:10.839
and me
and this little hottie

02:10.965 --> 02:12.758
from English class,
Jasmine Lotan.

02:12.883 --> 02:14.175
You guys know her?

02:14.301 --> 02:15.677
(whistles):
Yeah, she's cute.

02:15.803 --> 02:16.845
You guys dating?

02:16.971 --> 02:17.763
We will be once I ask her out.

02:17.888 --> 02:19.347
Okay.

02:19.473 --> 02:20.682
But seriously,
I think it would be cool

02:20.808 --> 02:22.183
to double with you
and Ade.

02:22.309 --> 02:23.477
You know, show Jasmine
I'm friends

02:23.602 --> 02:24.478
with respectable couples.

02:24.603 --> 02:26.229
Sure, yeah, that sounds fun.

02:26.354 --> 02:28.523
Great. A lot of fun.

02:28.649 --> 02:30.859
(phone rings) WOMAN:
Fancy Nails. May I help you?

02:30.985 --> 02:32.444
WOMAN 2:
Mm, what color is that?

02:32.569 --> 02:33.821
I love it.

02:33.946 --> 02:35.614
Oh, it's called Dulce de Leche.

02:35.739 --> 02:36.782
Oh.

02:36.907 --> 02:38.659
I'll get that, too.

02:39.952 --> 02:41.996
I've never been here before,

02:43.497 --> 02:44.372
Are they any good?

02:44.498 --> 02:47.542
Actually, this is my first time
here, too.

02:47.668 --> 02:48.919
We just moved nearby.

02:49.044 --> 02:50.587
Oh, "we"?

02:50.712 --> 02:53.381
As in you and your boyfriend?

02:53.507 --> 02:55.634
(laughs)
Yeah, right.

02:55.759 --> 02:56.718
Me and my husband.

02:56.844 --> 02:59.763
Wow, you're married.

02:59.888 --> 03:00.806
Mm-hmm.

03:00.931 --> 03:03.391
Of course.

03:03.517 --> 03:05.602
Hmm.

03:05.727 --> 03:07.813
So, how long
you been married?

03:07.938 --> 03:10.482
19 years.

03:10.607 --> 03:12.400
19 years?

03:12.526 --> 03:14.069
I know. It's a long time, huh?

03:14.193 --> 03:16.404
And I wouldn't
believe it myself,

03:16.530 --> 03:17.865
except my kids are juniors
in high school.

03:17.990 --> 03:18.866
You know,
I'm such a mom,

03:18.991 --> 03:20.241
I actually have pictures.

03:20.367 --> 03:22.536
I don't suppose
you want to see them.

03:22.661 --> 03:24.412
Sure, why not?

03:25.789 --> 03:27.332
Here we go.

03:27.457 --> 03:30.544
This is my
daughter, Annie.

03:30.669 --> 03:32.963
And this...

03:33.088 --> 03:35.382
is my son, Dixon.

03:38.510 --> 03:40.428
College is
a big decision.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.389
As a junior, I'm sure you've
already started thinking

03:42.514 --> 03:44.224
about where
you want to go.

03:45.600 --> 03:46.810
Right?

03:46.935 --> 03:49.604
Right. Exactly.

03:49.730 --> 03:50.731
No, I was actually

03:50.856 --> 03:52.774
gonna do you a favor
and save you some time

03:52.900 --> 03:54.193
so you can focus
on those kids

03:54.317 --> 03:56.778
in wood shop or read fashion
magazines. Your choice.

03:56.904 --> 03:59.031
I'll be going
to California University.

03:59.156 --> 04:00.949
CU is certainly a great school.

04:01.075 --> 04:02.367
Uh! It's more
than great.

04:02.492 --> 04:03.702
It's perfect,
it's beautiful.

04:03.827 --> 04:05.746
It's where my grandfather went.
He took there as a kid.

04:05.871 --> 04:07.873
Uh! It's just like

04:07.998 --> 04:09.917
being on those
east coast campuses

04:10.042 --> 04:12.711
except the weather's great and
the people are good-looking.

04:12.836 --> 04:14.046
Well, it's
definitely important

04:14.171 --> 04:15.672
to know what you like,
but you need to think about...

04:15.797 --> 04:16.757
Oh, trust me.

04:16.882 --> 04:18.632
I have thought about everything.

04:18.759 --> 04:21.595
I know exactly how my four
years at CU will play out.

04:21.720 --> 04:23.680
Freshman year,
I'll pledge Pi Phi

04:23.805 --> 04:25.891
no matter how much the DGs beg.
(chuckles)

04:26.016 --> 04:27.142
And then sophomore year,

04:27.267 --> 04:29.519
well, that is when
I'll find my Mr. Clark.

04:29.644 --> 04:30.729
Naomi...

04:30.854 --> 04:32.439
He'll be a Sigma
Alpha Epsilon.

04:32.564 --> 04:33.648
He'll probably
play football...

04:33.774 --> 04:35.901
Naomi, stop.

04:36.026 --> 04:38.737
CU isn't going to happen.

04:38.862 --> 04:41.364
What do you mean?

04:41.489 --> 04:42.616
Your test scores

04:42.741 --> 04:44.576
aren't anywhere near
what they require.

04:44.701 --> 04:45.994
Neither are your grades.

04:46.120 --> 04:47.662
And you have
no extracurricular activities.

04:47.788 --> 04:50.749
But I love it there.

04:50.874 --> 04:52.960
And I'm a legacy.

04:53.085 --> 04:55.712
I'm afraid that's not going
to be enough.

04:57.297 --> 04:59.967
However, if you want
to stay nearby,

05:00.092 --> 05:01.426
there are plenty
of other schools

05:01.551 --> 05:03.178
that are well
within your reach.

05:03.303 --> 05:06.306
Places like Santa Monica
Community College.

05:42.301 --> 05:43.510
"We're, uh, all
in the gutter,

05:43.635 --> 05:45.512
but some of us are
looking at the stars."

05:45.637 --> 05:46.596
Hi.

05:46.721 --> 05:48.265
It's Oscar Wilde.

05:48.389 --> 05:50.058
Had a really good time

05:50.184 --> 05:51.185
the other night
with you.

05:51.310 --> 05:52.727
Stargazing.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.313
Yeah, me, too.

05:54.437 --> 05:56.564
You got any plans
after school?

05:56.690 --> 05:57.691
Thought I'd hit
Chinatown.

05:57.816 --> 05:58.775
There's this
dim sum place,

05:58.900 --> 06:00.902
my uncle used to take me
there as a kid.

06:01.028 --> 06:03.446
I'd just really like to
get back there, you know?

06:03.571 --> 06:04.906
In his memory.

06:05.032 --> 06:08.869
Yeah, um, sure.
Sure, I will come with you.

06:15.625 --> 06:17.294
Trust me, this is
the best meeting.

06:17.418 --> 06:18.753
There are a lot
of celebrities.

06:18.879 --> 06:20.588
Can't really tell
you who they are

06:20.714 --> 06:23.300
because, well, it's anonymous,
but let's just say

06:23.424 --> 06:24.885
say last time
I was here,

06:25.010 --> 06:26.636
there was someone that rhymes
with Ritney Rears.

06:26.761 --> 06:28.387
Oh, and they also have
the best donuts.

06:28.513 --> 06:29.472
None of that powdered
sugar business.

06:29.597 --> 06:31.474
I've seen actual fritters.

06:31.599 --> 06:33.434
But listen,
today is about you

06:33.560 --> 06:34.435
and your accomplishments.

06:34.561 --> 06:35.478
I mean, six months sober,

06:35.603 --> 06:36.980
that's a big deal.
Thank you so much

06:37.105 --> 06:39.398
for coming to support, guys.
It means so much.

06:39.524 --> 06:41.860
Of course. We would not
miss it for the world.

06:41.985 --> 06:43.653
Now let's go get some fritters
that Navid's been talking up.

06:43.778 --> 06:45.655
No, no, no, you stay.
I'm gonna go.

06:45.780 --> 06:46.865
Just in case
you need muscle

06:46.990 --> 06:48.407
to get to the front
of the line.
Okay.

06:48.533 --> 06:49.743
You know how proud
I am of you, right?

06:49.868 --> 06:52.204
Yes, I do.

06:52.329 --> 06:54.497
He's so sweet, right?

06:54.622 --> 06:55.832
Yeah, he is.

06:55.957 --> 06:58.585
You're really lucky to have such
a great boyfriend.

06:58.710 --> 07:00.337
I know. I am.

07:00.461 --> 07:02.630
Really lucky.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.799
I agree.

07:04.925 --> 07:05.967
Here you go.

07:06.093 --> 07:08.178
One apple, one pear.

07:08.303 --> 07:09.346
Thank you, sweetie.

07:09.470 --> 07:10.764
All right, I'm gonna

07:10.889 --> 07:12.515
find us some seats, okay?

07:14.393 --> 07:15.435
Oh, my God.

07:16.603 --> 07:18.479
I have-I have to go.
Why?

07:18.605 --> 07:20.648
I'm sorry.
I'll call you later, okay?

07:20.774 --> 07:22.442
What happened?
Who is that woman?

07:24.861 --> 07:25.862
Jackie.

07:25.987 --> 07:27.697
Silver's mom.

07:29.866 --> 07:31.451
Silver?

07:40.835 --> 07:43.338
(dog barking in distance)

07:49.510 --> 07:51.388
(knocking)

07:54.641 --> 07:55.350
Hey.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.018
Go away and don't come back.

07:57.144 --> 07:59.396
Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait, wait. Why?

07:59.520 --> 08:00.981
Why?

08:01.106 --> 08:02.732
Because you're a junior
in high school, that's why!

08:02.857 --> 08:05.693
How...?

08:05.819 --> 08:06.527
How did you...?

08:06.653 --> 08:08.071
Look, Sasha,
I can explain.

08:08.196 --> 08:10.324
Explain what?
That you're not 17?

08:10.449 --> 08:11.783
No. I mean, I am, but...

08:11.908 --> 08:13.410
But what?

08:13.534 --> 08:15.495
Uh! I feel like
such a fool.

08:15.620 --> 08:18.415
I cannot believe I
was actually falling

08:18.539 --> 08:20.083
for a high school kid.
Sasha...

08:20.208 --> 08:22.336
No, stay away from me.

08:22.461 --> 08:25.630
I'm serious. Just stay away.

08:48.153 --> 08:50.071
(turns off engine)

08:55.160 --> 08:56.703
(car alarm chirps)

08:59.998 --> 09:01.916
(knocking)

09:04.085 --> 09:06.087
♪ ♪

09:08.589 --> 09:11.510
(chuckles)
You forgot your fritter.

09:11.634 --> 09:13.553
Come on in.
Thanks.

09:15.180 --> 09:16.764
I'm sorry I left the meeting.

09:16.890 --> 09:18.892
I... I just couldn't deal.

09:19.017 --> 09:20.727
No, I totally get it.

09:23.021 --> 09:25.565
You know, your mom got
a chip tonight.

09:25.690 --> 09:26.858
30 days sober.

09:26.983 --> 09:28.693
Good for her.

09:31.530 --> 09:32.572
She talked to me after.

09:32.697 --> 09:35.116
Said she really wants
to see you.

09:36.326 --> 09:37.536
She said she's changed.

09:37.660 --> 09:39.913
Like I haven't heard
that before.

09:40.038 --> 09:41.873
No, I know. I'm just saying,

09:41.998 --> 09:44.918
she, um, she seems
really different.

09:45.043 --> 09:46.836
She's an addict.

09:46.961 --> 09:49.839
Yeah, and once addicts sober up,
they become different people.

09:49.964 --> 09:51.049
(laughs)

09:51.174 --> 09:54.511
When I think about
what I used to be like:

09:54.635 --> 09:56.179
so sneaky,

09:56.304 --> 09:59.558
manipulative, a liar...

09:59.682 --> 10:01.684
And you changed?

10:01.809 --> 10:02.685
Really?

10:05.480 --> 10:06.606
What's that supposed to mean?

10:06.731 --> 10:10.693
Nothing. Just forget it.

10:10.818 --> 10:11.945
No, you obviously meant
something by that.

10:12.070 --> 10:13.654
What is it?

10:13.780 --> 10:14.781
What?

10:14.906 --> 10:17.617
I saw you kiss Teddy
at the Beach Club.

10:22.497 --> 10:27.085
Look, I, um...

10:27.210 --> 10:28.587
I made a mistake.

10:30.213 --> 10:31.298
Please don't tell Navid.

10:31.423 --> 10:34.842
I'm not going to, okay?
But you should.

10:34.968 --> 10:35.927
No!

10:36.052 --> 10:37.137
Look, these things,

10:37.262 --> 10:39.722
they don't just go away.

10:39.847 --> 10:41.141
You think that
they will,

10:41.266 --> 10:42.601
you want them to,
but they don't.

10:42.725 --> 10:44.144
Trust me.

10:44.269 --> 10:46.020
I mean, look at what the kiss
with Ethan did to me and Dixon.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.939
That was a completely
different situation.

10:48.064 --> 10:49.857
No...
Yes, it was.

10:49.983 --> 10:52.402
You were confused, you didn't
even know who you liked.

10:52.527 --> 10:55.489
Me, I'm not confused.
I...

10:55.614 --> 10:57.324
made a mistake,

10:57.449 --> 10:59.784
and so I'm gonna move on and
pretend like it didn't happen.

10:59.909 --> 11:01.702
It's not going to work.

11:01.828 --> 11:05.165
You know, it's really
none of your business.

11:05.290 --> 11:08.001
So maybe you should
just stay out of it, okay?

11:11.838 --> 11:13.672
(door opening)

11:14.799 --> 11:16.926
(door slams shut)

11:17.051 --> 11:19.762
Joseph Campbell got the term
"monomyth" from Joyce.

11:19.887 --> 11:22.849
He also called it
"The Hero's Journey."

11:22.974 --> 11:25.977
So who are some heroes
that have famous monomyths?

11:26.102 --> 11:29.523
There's Buddha, there's Moses,
there's Christ,

11:29.648 --> 11:31.316
Luke Skywalker,

11:31.441 --> 11:33.860
Ryan Matthews.
(laughter)

11:33.985 --> 11:35.153
Hey, I just got this phone.

11:35.278 --> 11:37.738
Have you downloaded
the beat app yet?
Give it back.

11:37.864 --> 11:38.990
Hang on, let me show
you how to get to it.

11:39.115 --> 11:41.284
Don't touch anything.
Just give it back, man.

11:41.409 --> 11:43.786
(clearing throat)
I'll take the phone.

11:43.911 --> 11:45.872
No, it's all right,
I'll just put it away.

11:45.997 --> 11:46.956
No, you just give it to me.

11:47.081 --> 11:48.291
You'll get it back
at the end of class.

11:48.416 --> 11:50.502
Come on, man, that's not fair.

11:50.627 --> 11:52.546
Write about it.

11:52.671 --> 11:54.713
Your own personal monomyth.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.815
Naomi?

12:12.940 --> 12:14.901
Why are you wearing sweatpants?

12:15.026 --> 12:16.069
Are you okay?

12:16.194 --> 12:18.737
Yeah. Well, since I'm not
going to CU,

12:18.863 --> 12:20.281
I'll probably end up working
at a fast-food joint,

12:20.407 --> 12:23.117
so might as well dress
the part, right?

12:27.539 --> 12:28.873
Now, look, I know
that you're mad at me,

12:28.998 --> 12:31.750
but we have a much
bigger problem.

12:33.211 --> 12:34.337
Oh, my God.

12:34.462 --> 12:35.672
Naomi's wearing sweats?

12:35.796 --> 12:37.090
Yeah.
What?

12:37.215 --> 12:38.799
I don't know.

12:38.925 --> 12:40.218
Um...

12:43.888 --> 12:46.891
So, can I have my...?
You know what, I wanted to talk
to you about your paper.

12:47.016 --> 12:48.685
What's the problem with it?

12:48.809 --> 12:51.605
Well, there is no problem.

12:51.730 --> 12:53.106
It's great.

12:53.231 --> 12:54.274
In fact, The L.A. Times

12:54.399 --> 12:56.276
is sponsoring
a high school essay contest

12:56.401 --> 12:58.819
and I really think
you should enter.

12:58.945 --> 13:00.614
Look, I made some
suggestions for revision...

13:00.739 --> 13:02.365
Do I have to enter?

13:02.490 --> 13:04.867
No, you don't have to.

13:04.992 --> 13:06.536
Cool. Then I'll pass.

13:06.661 --> 13:08.871
Can I just have
my phone?

13:08.996 --> 13:10.873
I don't get you, Liam.

13:10.998 --> 13:12.791
You're a smart kid.
What, is it not cool to care?

13:12.917 --> 13:14.127
Look, find another
special project,

13:14.252 --> 13:15.962
'cause it's not
going to be me.

13:16.087 --> 13:17.589
Just give me back my phone.

13:17.714 --> 13:19.424
"Give me back my phone"?

13:19.549 --> 13:23.136
Sorry. Give me back my phone,
please.

13:23.261 --> 13:24.304
Absolutely.

13:24.429 --> 13:26.055
At the end of the day.

13:26.180 --> 13:29.726
What?!
Looks like I found
something you care about.

13:34.773 --> 13:36.608
You guys sure you don't want

13:36.733 --> 13:37.984
to even up the teams?

13:38.109 --> 13:40.069
You three against me?
You want to break, Dixon?

13:40.194 --> 13:42.322
I just can't believe
it's over between me and Sasha.

13:42.447 --> 13:44.658
Yeah, I'll just break.

13:44.783 --> 13:46.576
You know what's
gonna help?

13:46.701 --> 13:48.328
Death?

13:48.453 --> 13:52.165
That or this super hot chick
from my history class.

13:52.290 --> 13:54.334
She might not be a cool deejay
with an unbelievable amount

13:54.459 --> 13:57.211
of sports knowledge, but she
does have some really nice, um,

13:57.337 --> 13:58.755
curves.

14:02.383 --> 14:03.926
NAVID:
Nice.

14:04.051 --> 14:05.261
DIXON:
Honestly, guys,

14:05.386 --> 14:07.013
I just can't accept that

14:07.138 --> 14:09.015
that's the last time
I'm gonna see her.

14:09.140 --> 14:12.477
And I know Sasha's going
through it, too.

14:12.602 --> 14:13.894
I know she's
torn up.

14:14.020 --> 14:15.229
She told me she was starting
to fall for me.

14:15.355 --> 14:18.107
Really? 'Cause if she said that,
you've still got a chance.

14:18.232 --> 14:19.025
Yeah?

14:19.150 --> 14:19.942
No, he doesn't.

14:21.152 --> 14:22.862
Sorry, but you don't.

14:22.987 --> 14:24.781
Sure he does--
it's like me and Naomi.

14:24.905 --> 14:27.241
Oh, right, like that
mysterious plan

14:27.367 --> 14:29.160
that you haven't
implemented yet?
Technical difficulties.

14:29.285 --> 14:31.454
The point is, if you like
someone and they like you,

14:31.579 --> 14:33.164
there's a way
around obstacles.

14:33.289 --> 14:35.458
Yeah, like if Dixon went into
a rapid aging machine.

14:35.583 --> 14:38.085
Dude, what's your problem?
I just don't want
you to get

14:38.211 --> 14:39.086
your hopes up, all right?

14:39.212 --> 14:40.380
She's told you she's done.

14:40.505 --> 14:42.507
So why not give it
another shot?

14:42.632 --> 14:43.966
I mean, what's he got
to lose, right?

14:44.091 --> 14:45.885
Yeah...

14:46.010 --> 14:48.054
Yeah.

14:48.179 --> 14:49.972
I mean, what do I have to lose?

14:55.186 --> 14:58.606
Did you guys just drag me
here for lunch to torture me?

14:58.732 --> 15:00.316
I should be getting used
to double-beef burgers

15:00.441 --> 15:01.901
and the fryolator.

15:02.026 --> 15:04.028
We are not
torturing you.

15:04.153 --> 15:06.322
We are inspiring you.

15:06.447 --> 15:08.074
This is your dream.

15:08.199 --> 15:10.284
Come on, how many times
have you done pilates

15:10.410 --> 15:12.078
to the CU fight song?

15:12.203 --> 15:14.414
Who cares.
I'm done with pilates forever.

15:14.539 --> 15:16.875
Why, because some jaded
college counselor

15:16.999 --> 15:18.501
said you won't
get in here?

15:18.626 --> 15:19.960
Come on, you are
not a quitter.

15:20.086 --> 15:21.838
Yeah, when have you ever
taken no for an answer?

15:21.962 --> 15:24.090
This morning,
at the coffee shop.

15:24.215 --> 15:25.925
They were out of soy.

15:26.050 --> 15:28.177
Well, you should have
made them get more.

15:28.302 --> 15:29.929
Because that's
who you are.
Yeah.

15:30.054 --> 15:31.222
Remember at Hermès
when the saleslady said

15:31.347 --> 15:33.307
they were all sold out
of the Birkin bag you wanted?

15:33.433 --> 15:34.475
What'd you do?

15:34.601 --> 15:36.352
I called the regional manager,

15:36.477 --> 15:38.187
demanded they have
the salesgirl fired.

15:38.312 --> 15:39.439
Exactly.

15:39.564 --> 15:40.774
And then what happened?

15:40.899 --> 15:42.692
They tracked down the bag.

15:42.817 --> 15:43.443
And?

15:43.568 --> 15:46.279
And I bought two--

15:46.404 --> 15:49.031
the blue calfskin,
the brown crocodile.

15:49.156 --> 15:50.991
That's right,
because you are Naomi Clark.

15:51.117 --> 15:52.368
When somebody says you
can't have something,

15:52.493 --> 15:54.161
you try to get them fired.

15:54.287 --> 15:56.038
Which, for the record,
I do have a problem with,

15:56.163 --> 15:57.290
but you don't, so
it doesn't matter.

15:57.415 --> 15:59.166
You go after

15:59.292 --> 16:01.085
what you want and you don't
take no for an answer.

16:01.210 --> 16:02.796
What the...?!

16:02.921 --> 16:04.964
MAN:
Sorry about that.

16:10.929 --> 16:12.221
You have a good arm.

16:12.346 --> 16:13.932
(laughs)

16:17.727 --> 16:19.646
You're right.
You're right!

16:19.771 --> 16:22.523
I'm not going to let
some college counselor,

16:22.649 --> 16:24.317
who wears an ankle bracelet
under her stockings,

16:24.442 --> 16:25.568
get in my way.

16:25.693 --> 16:28.237
I just have to find a way
to get into CU.

16:28.362 --> 16:29.322
And I will.

16:29.447 --> 16:30.990
Awesome.
That's what we want to hear.

16:31.115 --> 16:33.326
Oh, my God!

16:33.451 --> 16:35.411
I'm wearing sweatpants!

16:50.217 --> 16:53.304
Mm...

16:53.429 --> 16:55.181
The only thing that would
make me happier right now

16:55.306 --> 16:58.309
is if you had a refrigerator
right by your bed.

16:58.434 --> 16:59.811
(laughing)

16:59.936 --> 17:01.521
With a pot roast inside.

17:01.646 --> 17:02.981
Yeah.

17:03.147 --> 17:04.357
I'm so famished.

17:04.482 --> 17:06.526
But I'm thinking
more like

17:06.651 --> 17:08.486
fried chicken and waffles.

17:08.611 --> 17:10.445
Yeah.
Oh, yeah!

17:10.570 --> 17:11.990
Oh, shoot.

17:12.114 --> 17:13.992
I forgot to tell
you something.

17:14.116 --> 17:15.492
Say you have Roscoe's
in your book bag,

17:15.617 --> 17:17.619
and all is forgiven.

17:17.744 --> 17:18.954
No, but it is
about food.

17:19.079 --> 17:20.999
It's about
dinner actually.

17:21.123 --> 17:22.541
Uh...
Yeah?

17:22.666 --> 17:23.960
Teddy asked us
to double date

17:24.084 --> 17:25.002
with him and some chick.

17:25.127 --> 17:26.045
What? No.

17:26.170 --> 17:27.046
No?

17:27.171 --> 17:29.298
No. I don't want
to double date.

17:29.423 --> 17:30.424
Why not?

17:30.550 --> 17:32.719
Because...

17:32.844 --> 17:36.138
I would rather
just be with you alone.

17:36.263 --> 17:38.558
Well, yeah, me, too,
but he already asked.

17:38.683 --> 17:40.560
Okay, so just say no.

17:40.685 --> 17:41.728
I already told him yes.

17:41.853 --> 17:42.729
He wants to impress a girl.

17:42.854 --> 17:44.397
Come on, he asked
me for a favor.

17:44.522 --> 17:45.690
I want to help him out.

17:45.815 --> 17:47.025
It's one night.
What's the big deal?

17:49.610 --> 17:52.071
Okay, fine.

17:59.370 --> 18:01.706
RYAN:
What are you doing?

18:05.292 --> 18:07.837
You were supposed to give me
back my phone,

18:07.962 --> 18:09.171
but you weren't
here, so...

18:09.296 --> 18:11.758
So you just started
going through my desk?

18:11.883 --> 18:13.175
My phone's got important
stuff on it.

18:13.300 --> 18:14.427
Stuff that can't get erased.

18:14.552 --> 18:16.846
You just got yourself
a week's detention.

18:16.971 --> 18:18.014
All right, move.

18:18.138 --> 18:19.223
Away.

18:19.348 --> 18:21.392
That is so unfair.

18:21.517 --> 18:23.352
I wouldn't have had
to go through your desk

18:23.477 --> 18:24.771
If you'd been here...

18:24.896 --> 18:26.689
You had to? You didn't
have to do anything, Liam.

18:26.814 --> 18:27.774
You shouldn't have taken

18:27.899 --> 18:29.817
my phone from me
in the first place.

18:29.943 --> 18:32.319
You know what, let's make it
ten days of detention.
What is this about?

18:32.445 --> 18:33.446
Is it because I didn't enter
your stupid contest?

18:33.571 --> 18:35.364
Excuse me?

18:35.489 --> 18:37.617
Why are you being
such an a...?
That's it, man.

18:37.742 --> 18:39.326
I am sick
of your attitude problem.

18:39.452 --> 18:41.370
You know your parents told
the school to call

18:41.495 --> 18:43.163
if we had any problems
with you this year.

18:43.289 --> 18:44.248
Wait, wait, what?

18:44.373 --> 18:46.250
And this qualifies.

18:46.375 --> 18:48.168
So we're all going to have
a little sit-down.

18:48.294 --> 18:50.588
No, look, I'll just...
I'll take the detention.

18:50.713 --> 18:52.048
Yeah, I'm sorry.

18:52.172 --> 18:53.424
It's too late.

18:53.549 --> 18:55.301
You don't understand.

18:55.426 --> 18:57.219
My stepdad is a jerk.

18:57.344 --> 18:58.763
Everybody's a jerk, right?
Your stepdad, me.

18:58.888 --> 19:00.389
Well, I got a thought
for you, Liam.

19:00.514 --> 19:01.766
Maybe we're not the problem,
okay?

19:01.891 --> 19:03.142
Maybe you're the problem.

19:12.151 --> 19:13.360
Hey, you.

19:13.486 --> 19:14.445
What's going on?

19:14.570 --> 19:16.114
What does it look like?

19:16.238 --> 19:17.531
I'm studying to
get into CU.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.117
That's awesome.

19:19.241 --> 19:20.493
Little known fact--

19:20.618 --> 19:22.369
huge corollary between studying
and raising your grades.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.163
Who said anything about grades?

19:25.623 --> 19:28.042
I did a little research
on the Dean of Admissions.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.376
Her son goes to CU.

19:29.502 --> 19:30.628
He's an S.A.T. tutor.

19:30.753 --> 19:32.296
So I hired him.

19:32.421 --> 19:34.423
Cool. So you're going to focus
on the S.A.T.s?

19:34.548 --> 19:36.634
Yeah... no, I'm gonna date
the dean's son.

19:36.759 --> 19:38.594
Honestly, Silver,
try to keep up.

19:38.719 --> 19:40.471
Once we start dating,

19:40.596 --> 19:42.431
well, he'll take me
home to Mom--

19:42.556 --> 19:43.516
naturally I'll charm her
instantly.

19:43.641 --> 19:45.143
Eventually,

19:45.267 --> 19:47.520
dear Richard and I will part
amicably,

19:47.645 --> 19:50.397
but not before the dean and I
have forged a lasting bond.

19:50.523 --> 19:52.525
The type of bond that will
guarantee me a place

19:52.650 --> 19:53.651
at CU in the fall of 2011.

19:53.776 --> 19:55.361
Wow, Naomi.

19:55.486 --> 19:57.738
Don't you think it's just
a little bit easier to--

19:57.864 --> 19:59.573
I don't know-- study?

19:59.699 --> 20:01.826
The key to success is knowing
one's strengths.

20:01.951 --> 20:03.536
I am terrible at tests.

20:03.661 --> 20:05.913
But I'm an excellent dater.

20:06.039 --> 20:08.791
Unfortunately, Richard
is a bit of a snooze-fest.

20:08.916 --> 20:11.085
His Facebook says he's some
super environmentalist.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.545
So I have to
read all these

20:12.670 --> 20:14.755
global warming books
to make him think

20:14.881 --> 20:16.049
we have stuff in common.

20:16.174 --> 20:17.257
Hey, easy on the pours.

20:17.383 --> 20:18.384
Seriously, we're
in a drought here.

20:21.261 --> 20:22.429
What do you think?

20:22.555 --> 20:23.639
Sounds like I care about
the environment, right?

20:35.735 --> 20:37.111
Please, listen,

20:37.236 --> 20:38.487
just hear me out.

20:38.612 --> 20:40.656
All right, and afterwards
if you want me to get lost,

20:40.781 --> 20:42.200
I'll get lost.

20:42.324 --> 20:43.242
Forever.

20:49.874 --> 20:52.376
I, uh, bought you a pizza.

20:52.501 --> 20:53.920
'Cause when we met
at the pizza parlor

20:54.045 --> 20:56.338
we didn't know
each other's ages.

20:56.463 --> 20:59.884
All we knew
was that we liked each other.

21:00.009 --> 21:03.429
And yes, when I found out
that you were older, I lied.

21:03.554 --> 21:07.225
Which was a really,
really stupid thing to do.

21:09.060 --> 21:10.978
Look, the only reason
why I lied,

21:11.104 --> 21:15.399
was because I couldn't believe
that a girl as cool,

21:15.524 --> 21:18.861
as down-to-earth...

21:18.986 --> 21:20.487
and as beautiful as you existed.

21:20.613 --> 21:23.323
But you want
to know something?

21:23.449 --> 21:25.492
Although I feel terrible
about lying,

21:25.618 --> 21:28.370
I'm actually glad I did.

21:28.495 --> 21:30.790
Because if I would have
told you I was 17,

21:30.915 --> 21:33.084
you would have never
gone out with me.

21:33.209 --> 21:35.836
So yes, I lied
about my age,

21:35.962 --> 21:38.547
but all the things
that we talked about,

21:38.672 --> 21:42.384
everything, all the stuff about
how I was feeling,

21:42.509 --> 21:45.805
how you were feeling,
none of that was a lie.

21:45.930 --> 21:47.681
So I'm here because

21:47.807 --> 21:52.270
I'm hoping maybe
we can start over.

21:52.394 --> 21:54.521
No more lies.

21:54.647 --> 21:58.609
Just you and me...

21:58.734 --> 22:01.237
and half sausage,
half pepperoni.

22:02.321 --> 22:04.782
Get lost.

22:25.178 --> 22:26.262
"Please come
to the meeting tonight.

22:26.386 --> 22:27.721
"I'm speaking.

22:27.847 --> 22:29.182
"I really want to
make things right with us.

22:29.307 --> 22:31.558
Love, Mom."

22:31.684 --> 22:33.519
Wow.

22:33.644 --> 22:35.229
Right on the dashboard?

22:35.353 --> 22:36.939
Yep.

22:38.232 --> 22:40.776
So, are you gonna go?

22:41.944 --> 22:44.446
I have no idea.

22:46.532 --> 22:48.034
JASPER:
You haven't seen Metropolis?

22:48.159 --> 22:49.785
That's even more egregious

22:49.910 --> 22:52.538
than your lack of experience
with dim sum.

22:52.663 --> 22:54.915
Hey, don't I get credit
for trying chicken feet?

22:55.041 --> 22:56.792
Okay, I popped back, like,
three of those suckers.

22:56.917 --> 22:58.711
Okay, yeah, you're right.
Credit gained.

22:58.836 --> 23:00.963
And, uh, then it's deducted

23:01.088 --> 23:02.965
for your staggering
cinematic naivete.

23:03.090 --> 23:05.259
Ah.
And no, Annie, I'm sorry,

23:05.383 --> 23:07.553
but Kansas,
it's not an excuse.

23:07.678 --> 23:09.638
You've lived in L.A.
for, like, a year.

23:09.763 --> 23:12.141
Well, I guess I've
been hanging out
in the wrong scene.

23:12.266 --> 23:13.934
Yeah, no kidding.

23:14.060 --> 23:16.103
It's gonna blow your mind,
Metropolis.

23:16.229 --> 23:18.772
It's huge. It's all about
man versus society.

23:18.898 --> 23:20.607
Big influence
on the movie I'm making.

23:20.733 --> 23:22.151
You're making a movie?

23:22.276 --> 23:23.861
Oh, yeah, half
narrative,

23:23.986 --> 23:25.403
half documentary,

23:25.529 --> 23:28.657
half really just sick
experimental stuff.

23:28.782 --> 23:31.785
Think like, Matthew Barney
meets, uh, Michael Moore.

23:31.911 --> 23:34.288
Cool.
Yeah.

23:34.412 --> 23:36.582
Actually there's, uh,

23:36.707 --> 23:37.791
there's a band
playing tonight,

23:37.917 --> 23:39.501
The Script.

23:39.626 --> 23:40.920
Thought I might use them
for part of my score.

23:41.045 --> 23:43.463
Do you... want to come?

23:43.589 --> 23:44.798
Where are they playing?

23:44.924 --> 23:45.841
The Beach Club.

23:45.966 --> 23:48.719
Yeah, I will pass.

23:48.844 --> 23:50.679
Um, most of the people I hate
hang out there, so...

23:50.804 --> 23:52.056
What if I guaranteed

23:52.181 --> 23:53.640
you wouldn't have to see
any of them?

23:54.975 --> 23:56.018
Then would you go?

23:57.811 --> 24:00.606
♪ ♪

24:25.005 --> 24:27.465
Hi. Are you Richard?

24:27.591 --> 24:29.135
Naomi, hi.

24:29.260 --> 24:31.011
Oh, I'm so sorry I'm late.

24:31.137 --> 24:33.973
They really should repaint
the bike lanes by the Shrine.

24:36.809 --> 24:38.602
You rode your bike here
from Beverly Hills?

24:38.727 --> 24:41.563
Oh, just doing what I can to
reduce my carbon footprint.

24:41.688 --> 24:44.400
Wow, that's impressive.

24:44.524 --> 24:46.610
(giggling):
No, stop.

24:46.735 --> 24:48.654
No, seriously, I mean, I feel
like I'm surrounded by people

24:48.779 --> 24:50.197
who don't care about
the Earth, you know?

24:50.323 --> 24:52.699
They just guzzle water
from plastic water bottles...

24:52.825 --> 24:54.743
How do they sleep at night?

24:54.868 --> 24:56.036
No idea.

24:56.162 --> 24:57.579
You know what, I wish

24:57.704 --> 24:58.914
we could put pictures
of choking dolphins

24:59.039 --> 25:00.666
on the bottles.

25:00.791 --> 25:02.500
I think maybe then they'd think
twice about using them.

25:02.626 --> 25:04.753
Yeah, choking dolphins
would be awesome.

25:07.673 --> 25:09.800
Oh, hey, before we get
started with vocab,

25:09.925 --> 25:12.803
do you know where the
Independent Theater
is around here?

25:12.928 --> 25:14.930
I heard there's a showing of
FLOW, and I just wanted to see

25:15.055 --> 25:16.390
if I could catch it
later tonight.

25:16.514 --> 25:18.267
FLOW as in For Love Of Water?

25:18.392 --> 25:20.560
Yeah.
(gasping)

25:20.686 --> 25:22.104
I tried catching
the re-release last night,

25:22.229 --> 25:23.563
but they were sold out.

25:23.689 --> 25:25.607
You know, rumor has it
that you'll never view

25:25.732 --> 25:27.567
water politics
the same way again.

25:27.693 --> 25:29.862
Well, hey, you should come.

25:29.987 --> 25:30.821
I mean, I have another ticket.

25:30.946 --> 25:32.572
Oh. Oh.

25:32.698 --> 25:36.202
Well, you know,
I'm-I'm your tutor.

25:36.327 --> 25:37.411
I'm not sure that's appropriate.

25:37.535 --> 25:38.996
(laughing)

25:39.121 --> 25:40.706
Come on, it's not a date.

25:40.831 --> 25:42.958
It's just two like-minded
individuals going to see a film

25:43.083 --> 25:44.460
about something they're
passionate about.

25:44.584 --> 25:46.086
Plus, I hear it's

25:46.212 --> 25:47.463
kind of one of those flicks

25:47.587 --> 25:48.755
you've got to see
on the big screen.

25:48.881 --> 25:51.800
Kind of like The Dark Knight.

25:51.925 --> 25:55.471
God, you're tempting me.

25:55.595 --> 25:57.306
Yeah, you know, what the hell.

25:57.431 --> 25:58.765
It's just one movie.

25:58.891 --> 26:00.851
Great.

26:00.976 --> 26:02.769
Vocab.

26:11.529 --> 26:12.570
Sorry we're late.

26:12.696 --> 26:14.490
Hey, no worries.
How are you, buddy?

26:14.614 --> 26:15.782
Good, man,
how you doing?

26:15.908 --> 26:16.992
Hi.

26:17.117 --> 26:17.993
What, no hug?

26:18.118 --> 26:19.745
Oh, of course.

26:20.787 --> 26:22.081
Uh, guys, this is Jasmine.

26:22.206 --> 26:23.790
Jasmine, this is...

26:23.916 --> 26:24.624
Hey, I'm Adrianna.

26:24.750 --> 26:26.460
Hi.
And Navid.

26:26.584 --> 26:27.627
Have a seat.

26:34.927 --> 26:36.303
(clears throat)
Jazz...

26:36.429 --> 26:38.222
just moved to L.A.
from Kauai.

26:38.347 --> 26:39.432
NAVID:
Oh, no kidding.

26:39.557 --> 26:40.516
Sweet.

26:40.640 --> 26:41.808
Ade, you went
there once, right?

26:41.934 --> 26:42.642
With your mom?

26:42.768 --> 26:45.104
Um, yeah, a long time ago.

26:45.229 --> 26:46.313
Yeah, I remember.

26:46.439 --> 26:47.856
When she came back,
she would not

26:47.981 --> 26:48.941
take off her lei.

26:49.066 --> 26:50.067
I'm telling you,

26:50.192 --> 26:51.609
this thing was
not only wilting,

26:51.735 --> 26:53.279
but it was actually
starting to stink.

26:53.404 --> 26:55.822
NAVID:
You know, my family
actually vacations

26:55.948 --> 26:57.157
In Kauai every Christmas.

26:57.283 --> 26:59.701
Right on. Whereabouts?
Uh, North Shore.

26:59.826 --> 27:00.618
I mean, it's, like, one
of the most beautiful...

27:00.744 --> 27:01.703
I'm starving!
Should we look at the menu?

27:01.828 --> 27:02.955
NAVID:
Yeah.

27:03.080 --> 27:05.207
Sure.

27:07.460 --> 27:09.836
Hey, honey, do you want
to order two dishes and split?

27:09.962 --> 27:11.046
Yeah, sounds good.

27:11.171 --> 27:12.339
WAITRESS:
Hi.

27:12.465 --> 27:13.966
Can I get you guys
something to drink?

27:14.091 --> 27:15.509
Um, yeah, I think
I'll have an iced tea.

27:15.633 --> 27:18.011
No, make that
an Arnold Palmer.

27:18.137 --> 27:19.637
Um, I'm good with water.

27:21.307 --> 27:22.724
I think we're all
good for water.

27:22.849 --> 27:23.809
WAITRESS:
Okay, great.

27:23.934 --> 27:25.561
Oh, babe.
Oh!

27:25.685 --> 27:27.020
Oh, my God, um...

27:27.146 --> 27:28.314
I'm...
I got it. I got it.

27:28.439 --> 27:29.689
Don't worry about it.
So sorry.

27:34.612 --> 27:36.238
I am very impressed, Liam.

27:36.363 --> 27:38.824
It only took a month for us
to get called into school.

27:38.949 --> 27:40.742
You held it together

27:40.867 --> 27:41.785
a whole lot longer
than I thought you would.

27:41.910 --> 27:44.455
Honey...
Sweetheart, I know
this is tough

27:44.580 --> 27:45.789
for you but we had an agreement.

27:45.914 --> 27:46.915
If he screwed up
one more time...

27:47.040 --> 27:49.001
I know, I...
Sweetheart,

27:49.126 --> 27:50.294
we gave him a shot.

27:50.419 --> 27:52.004
We let him move back
into the house, but obviously

27:52.129 --> 27:53.797
it's not working.

27:53.922 --> 27:56.133
Some kids are just
bad seeds, you know?

27:56.258 --> 27:57.176
Liam is one of those.

27:58.594 --> 27:59.886
(clearing throat)

28:00.012 --> 28:01.514
Oh.

28:01.639 --> 28:02.806
Hi.

28:02.931 --> 28:04.975
Jeffrey Sarkossian.

28:05.100 --> 28:06.018
This is my wife, Colleen.

28:06.143 --> 28:07.144
Hi.

28:07.269 --> 28:08.979
Ryan Matthews. Nice to meet you.

28:09.104 --> 28:11.064
Look, uh, I wanted
to apologize

28:11.190 --> 28:13.442
ahead of time for whatever
trouble Liam got himself into.

28:13.567 --> 28:16.612
Trouble?
Yeah.

28:16.736 --> 28:18.364
Liam hasn't gotten
into any trouble.

28:18.489 --> 28:19.990
Listen, the reason
I called you both

28:20.115 --> 28:21.992
down here was to
tell you in person

28:22.117 --> 28:24.286
how great Liam's been doing.

28:26.246 --> 28:28.207
His first paper was terrific.

28:28.332 --> 28:30.000
It was insightful,

28:30.125 --> 28:32.085
well structured,
beautifully written.

28:32.211 --> 28:33.879
Oh, honey.

28:34.004 --> 28:35.713
You should be very proud of him.

28:52.189 --> 28:54.066
Okay, everyone, welcome.

28:54.191 --> 28:57.027
My name is Tim,
and I'm an alcoholic.

28:57.152 --> 29:00.197
ALL:
Hi, Tim.

29:00.322 --> 29:03.867
Sorry, I'm late.

29:05.827 --> 29:08.788
So, um...

29:08.914 --> 29:10.165
what you did...

29:10.290 --> 29:12.959
that was cool.

29:13.085 --> 29:16.129
The ten days of detention
still stand.

29:16.255 --> 29:18.257
Yeah, okay.

29:21.635 --> 29:23.011
Your phone.

29:26.306 --> 29:28.267
Thanks.
Mm-hmm.

29:31.520 --> 29:34.231
Hey, that essay
contest thing.

29:36.024 --> 29:38.026
Did I miss the deadline?

29:38.151 --> 29:40.779
Nope.

29:40.904 --> 29:42.531
Three days left.

29:42.656 --> 29:44.783
Cool.

29:53.083 --> 29:54.960
Oh, yeah, so I hiked
the waterfall.

29:55.085 --> 29:57.879
Of course, I thought it was
three miles instead of nine.

29:58.004 --> 30:00.090
And I ran out of water,
and, uh, I vomited.

30:00.215 --> 30:02.217
(laughing)

30:02.342 --> 30:04.344
Um, I gotta go
to the ladies' room.

30:04.470 --> 30:05.763
I'll be right back.

30:05.887 --> 30:08.766
Okay, sure, babe.

30:08.890 --> 30:10.434
Do you want to try
any French onion soup?

30:10.559 --> 30:11.810
Yeah, it's not very good.

30:22.904 --> 30:24.906
What's wrong with you?

30:25.031 --> 30:27.451
What are you talking about?
You know exactly

30:27.576 --> 30:28.994
what I'm talking about.

30:29.119 --> 30:30.954
Why would you ask Navid and I
on a double date?

30:31.079 --> 30:32.998
Just thought it'd be fun.

30:33.123 --> 30:35.083
(scoffs)
Yeah, right.

30:35.208 --> 30:37.127
And you had to make out with
Jasmine right in front of me.

30:37.252 --> 30:38.796
Really?
I'm sorry.

30:38.920 --> 30:40.255
Did that bother you?

30:40.380 --> 30:41.715
It's interesting because

30:41.840 --> 30:43.467
you know what
bothered me?
What?

30:43.592 --> 30:45.636
Having to listen to Navid
brag about having sex with you

30:45.761 --> 30:47.179
right after we kissed.

30:47.304 --> 30:49.848
Oh, so this is about
getting revenge?

30:49.973 --> 30:52.100
Look, what do you care
who I make out with?

30:52.225 --> 30:53.811
You've got a boyfriend,
remember?

30:53.935 --> 30:55.061
Okay, I know I have a boyfriend.

30:55.187 --> 30:56.480
I don't need you
to remind me.
So why are you

30:56.605 --> 30:58.482
acting so jealous?
I'm not acting jealous!

30:58.607 --> 31:00.776
It's just really annoying
because I know that

31:00.900 --> 31:01.860
you're trying
to make me jealous.

31:04.112 --> 31:05.905
So what if I am?

31:06.031 --> 31:07.282
It's obviously working.
It's not working.

31:07.407 --> 31:08.367
It's pathetic.

31:10.118 --> 31:11.953
Okay, you know what?

31:12.078 --> 31:13.997
I really could care less.

31:14.122 --> 31:15.165
Kiss whoever you want.

31:15.290 --> 31:16.667
Okay fine.

31:16.792 --> 31:17.876
Fine.

31:26.510 --> 31:29.388
You shouldn't
have done that.

31:39.147 --> 31:41.817
I'm sorry you're
not feeling good.

31:41.941 --> 31:43.985
You still want me
to come over?

31:44.110 --> 31:46.238
Uh, no,
I just need to sleep.

31:46.363 --> 31:47.906
Okay.

31:48.031 --> 31:49.157
Sure everything's okay?

31:49.282 --> 31:51.493
Everything's fine.

31:51.618 --> 31:53.829
Am I not allowed
to have a headache?

31:53.953 --> 31:56.206
Yeah, of course. Sorry.

32:09.386 --> 32:10.929
You look like
you're lost.

32:12.347 --> 32:15.517
Um, yeah.

32:15.642 --> 32:17.853
I'm looking for Reed Tower.

32:17.977 --> 32:19.772
I'm going that
way. Come on.

32:19.897 --> 32:21.523
Thank you.

32:21.648 --> 32:23.024
I'm Jamie, by the way.

32:23.149 --> 32:24.150
Naomi.

32:24.276 --> 32:25.861
I take it you don't
go here, huh?

32:25.985 --> 32:28.447
No, I'm going to apply.

32:28.572 --> 32:30.156
Yeah, you should, it's the best.

32:30.282 --> 32:33.159
And you, you are a Pi Phi
waiting to happen.

32:33.285 --> 32:36.455
So, you're psychic, huh?

32:36.580 --> 32:39.374
Psychic, SAE pledge,
hmm, same thing.

32:39.499 --> 32:41.376
Yeah, we, um,
we know things.

32:41.501 --> 32:44.087
Oh, like what?

32:44.212 --> 32:48.675
Like, uh, I know when I see
someone I have to meet.

32:48.801 --> 32:50.218
Why do you think I threw my
football at you yesterday?

32:50.343 --> 32:52.220
What?

32:52.345 --> 32:53.889
What, you thought
that was an accident?

32:54.013 --> 32:56.141
No, my arm is pretty
damn accurate.

32:56.266 --> 32:58.017
Don't think I would've made it
on the football team otherwise.

32:58.143 --> 32:59.853
(chuckling)

32:59.978 --> 33:03.022
So, you're on the team.
Mm-hmm. Yep.

33:03.148 --> 33:05.567
Would you want to come
to a game sometime?

33:05.692 --> 33:07.360
Mmm...
RICHARD:
Hey, there you are.

33:07.486 --> 33:09.321
I was afraid you got lost.

33:09.446 --> 33:12.031
Richard. Hi.

33:12.157 --> 33:14.952
I was actually just
asking for directions.

33:15.076 --> 33:16.244
Jamie, this is...

33:16.369 --> 33:17.329
My roommate Richard.

33:17.454 --> 33:18.371
Hey, man.

33:22.459 --> 33:24.252
(chuckles)

33:24.377 --> 33:26.212
So, we should get going if
we want to catch the bus.

33:26.338 --> 33:28.131
Yeah.

33:36.807 --> 33:37.933
So, these guys
are from Ireland?

33:38.057 --> 33:40.018
Yeah.
Cool.

33:41.728 --> 33:43.939
I'm sorry, man.
Just...

33:44.063 --> 33:45.482
not really
in the best mood.

33:45.607 --> 33:48.109
Hoping that music
gets my mind off Sasha.

33:48.234 --> 33:49.611
Yeah, no problem.

33:49.736 --> 33:50.779
So, what do you want to drink?

33:50.904 --> 33:51.905
Whatever.

33:52.030 --> 33:53.031
Oh, no.

33:53.156 --> 33:55.868
What are you doing here?

33:55.993 --> 33:57.452
Look, I just came
for the music.

33:57.577 --> 33:59.037
I had no idea
you were going to be here.

33:59.162 --> 34:00.956
Yeah, well, the musicians
are friends of mine.

34:01.080 --> 34:03.375
Adult friends.

34:03.500 --> 34:05.794
I'm sorry.

So, thanks, everyone,
for coming down.

34:16.094 --> 34:17.556
Uh, we're The Script

34:17.681 --> 34:19.264

are my children.

35:49.355 --> 35:51.858
I was such a terrible mother.

35:51.984 --> 35:54.736
Which is why I'm so grateful

35:54.861 --> 35:58.281
that one of my daughters
is here tonight.

35:58.406 --> 36:00.492
Thank you, honey,

36:00.617 --> 36:03.453
for giving me another chance.

36:03.578 --> 36:07.457
I promise you,
I will not let you down again.

something, if I could.

36:15.381 --> 36:16.257

36:24.891 --> 36:27.644
I really wanted
to be here tonight

36:27.769 --> 36:29.646
so that I could tell my mother,

36:29.771 --> 36:32.357
once and for all,

36:32.482 --> 36:34.067
to stay away from me.

36:34.192 --> 36:37.445
Everything that she said?
Trust me,

36:37.570 --> 36:39.739
it's going to last
until she's a bad day.

36:39.865 --> 36:42.325
Then she's going
to go back to the bottle

36:42.450 --> 36:46.412
or the pills, whatever
she can get her hands on.

36:46.538 --> 36:48.247
Oh.

36:48.373 --> 36:52.627
But you did get
one thing right, Jackie.

36:52.752 --> 36:54.504
You were a terrible mother.

36:54.629 --> 36:56.798
The worst of the worst.

36:56.923 --> 37:01.427
And if you think that you
can buy me back with a car...

37:01.553 --> 37:04.097
well, that's just proof
that you don't know me at all.

37:06.641 --> 37:08.226
