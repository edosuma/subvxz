WEBVTT

00:03.137 --> 00:03.771
They have the package.

00:06.207 --> 00:07.408
(screams)

00:11.179 --> 00:12.646
I'm an American citizen.

00:12.680 --> 00:14.248
Don't let him do this!
Move,

00:14.282 --> 00:15.449
or I will shoot through you.

00:15.483 --> 00:16.384
(gunshot)

00:18.719 --> 00:20.588
He's dead.

00:20.621 --> 00:22.556
The prisoner who got
away is Davis Goundry.

00:22.590 --> 00:23.657
GALLO:
We stumbled onto something here.

00:23.691 --> 00:25.059
No idea what it means.

00:25.093 --> 00:26.494
We lied in our debriefs.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.296
We're good as long
as our stories match.

00:28.329 --> 00:29.797
Two suits came by
my office today,

00:29.830 --> 00:31.665
wanting to know what records
you've been asking for.

00:31.699 --> 00:33.234
I think they were CIA.

00:33.267 --> 00:35.503
How does the Agency even
know we went to her?

00:35.536 --> 00:37.771
They're watching us.
HASKINS:
Jimmy Kam's been captured

00:37.805 --> 00:39.107
along with Sergeant Hendrix.

00:39.140 --> 00:40.308
I am Muslim.

00:40.341 --> 00:42.843
You never said so before.
What are you?

00:42.876 --> 00:44.812
My name is Khalid Samatar.

00:44.845 --> 00:48.349
I will exchange them
for 50 ISIS prisoners.

00:48.382 --> 00:49.783
Davis Goundry's sister
just called me.

00:49.817 --> 00:50.784
And the fact that
he and Khalid

00:50.818 --> 00:52.486
were both holding a domino,

00:52.520 --> 00:53.787
I think they may have
been working together.

00:53.821 --> 00:55.156
No. No way.
What if we made a mistake

00:55.189 --> 00:56.457
that night in Somalia?

00:56.490 --> 00:58.126
What if we let
a terrorist go free?

01:02.563 --> 01:04.432
You positive you
weren't followed?

01:04.465 --> 01:05.699
I was the only car on the road.

01:05.733 --> 01:06.734
Look, you are jumping to

01:06.767 --> 01:08.136
some big conclusions here.

01:08.169 --> 01:09.437
Just because the CIA

01:09.470 --> 01:10.771
talks to Goundry's sister,

01:10.804 --> 01:12.240
asks about his loyalty,

01:12.273 --> 01:13.407
that doesn't make him
a traitor.

01:13.441 --> 01:15.143
Goundry and Khalid
are connected.

01:15.176 --> 01:16.644
They both had that domino.

01:16.677 --> 01:18.279
Clearly, it's some kind
of a symbol.

01:18.312 --> 01:20.148
Maybe a calling card
of some sort?

01:20.181 --> 01:22.350
"Clearly" is going
a little bit far.
Think about it, Gallo.

01:22.383 --> 01:24.585
If Goundry was a CIA agent
who turned,

01:24.618 --> 01:27.755
that would explain
why the Agency wanted him dead.

01:27.788 --> 01:29.123
And why they worked so hard

01:29.157 --> 01:30.591
to cover it up.

01:32.326 --> 01:33.661
Yeah, it would.

01:35.929 --> 01:37.798
And we let him
go free.

01:37.831 --> 01:39.433
Hey...

01:42.803 --> 01:46.640
Look, you know the saying

01:46.674 --> 01:48.909
"Don't dig up more snakes
than you can kill"?

01:48.942 --> 01:52.880
People outside of Texas
don't say that.
It means

01:52.913 --> 01:54.415
don't make more trouble
when you already got plenty.

01:56.417 --> 01:58.352
We have to focus on
getting Jimmy back.

01:58.386 --> 02:01.722
Because if we did make
the wrong call over there,

02:01.755 --> 02:03.724
this is our chance
to do something right.

02:03.757 --> 02:05.759
(softly):
Yeah.

02:08.596 --> 02:10.531
*

02:17.905 --> 02:21.609
Khalid's negotiator has agreed
to a two-for-one deal--

02:21.642 --> 02:24.278
Sergeants Kam and Hendrix
for Khalid's brother Mustaf.

02:24.312 --> 02:26.680
If the intel committee can help
us get approval on his release,

02:26.714 --> 02:28.316
then we can move forward.

02:28.349 --> 02:29.750
The United States government
doesn't

02:29.783 --> 02:31.952
negotiate with terrorists.
Of course, ma'am,

02:31.985 --> 02:33.821
but Khalid's not,
technically, a terrorist.

02:33.854 --> 02:35.923
He's a warlord in an
autonomous region of Somalia.

02:35.956 --> 02:37.858
Potato, potahto.

02:37.891 --> 02:39.760
You understand
that this decision

02:39.793 --> 02:41.595
isn't up to us alone?

02:41.629 --> 02:42.763
I'm sure my son
explained that to you.

02:42.796 --> 02:44.332
If word of this leaked,

02:44.365 --> 02:45.366
it'd be an open invitation

02:45.399 --> 02:47.868
to kidnap U.S. citizens.

02:47.901 --> 02:50.504
Your committee can make
or break this deal.

02:52.840 --> 02:55.276
We need time to discuss.

02:55.309 --> 02:56.744
We did you the courtesy

02:56.777 --> 02:57.811
of coming down here
to listen,

02:57.845 --> 02:59.513
but we're not like the army.

02:59.547 --> 03:01.582
We do not make life
and death decisions

03:01.615 --> 03:03.284
on the spur of the moment.

03:05.819 --> 03:07.555
(gunfire on video game)

03:10.691 --> 03:12.560
Come on, die, mother...
Easy, man.

03:14.762 --> 03:16.797
This game's way
too violent for me.

03:16.830 --> 03:18.666
What?

03:18.699 --> 03:19.967
They're having a long
meeting in there.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.402
Hope your, uh,

03:21.435 --> 03:23.003
boyfriend's mom comes through.

03:23.036 --> 03:26.340
They all know the exchange is
the right call.

03:26.374 --> 03:27.675
You know
a prisoner exchange

03:27.708 --> 03:29.243
is not gonna be
a walk in the park.

03:29.277 --> 03:31.612
Fog cover is heavy
this time of year, Nora.

03:31.645 --> 03:32.813
Yeah, I saw that
in the brief, too.

03:32.846 --> 03:35.449
Don't worry,
Madani's the master

03:35.483 --> 03:38.252
at instrument flying.
And what, exactly, is that?

03:38.286 --> 03:39.987
It's a technique
for low-viz situations.

03:40.020 --> 03:42.690
Where you fly off
instrument reading only.

03:42.723 --> 03:43.924
Hence, the name.
That doesn't make me feel

03:43.957 --> 03:45.726
any better, 'cause
I barely trust you two

03:45.759 --> 03:47.395
when you can see
where you're going.

03:47.428 --> 03:48.962
Here I thought we were
cool now, Sergeant.

03:48.996 --> 03:50.598
Oh, we're cool.

03:50.631 --> 03:52.700
It's just my personality.
(Gallo chuckles)

03:52.733 --> 03:54.602
Cute.

03:54.635 --> 03:56.270
Hope you really are
the master, though,

03:56.304 --> 03:59.540
'cause, uh, we're all gonna
be counting on you.

04:02.343 --> 04:06.280
You really did not need
to do this, Mrs. Haskins.

04:06.314 --> 04:08.015
Please, call me Mae.

04:08.048 --> 04:09.683
And it's my pleasure.

04:09.717 --> 04:11.519
The colonel and I
want you to know

04:11.552 --> 04:13.321
we're here if you need us.

04:13.354 --> 04:17.358
Well, thank you.
Max will love these.

04:17.391 --> 04:19.493
The birthday barbecue,

04:19.527 --> 04:20.928
it's at our place
on Saturday.

04:20.961 --> 04:22.530
I know it's Jimmy's
this month,

04:22.563 --> 04:25.966
and we'd love
to have you there.

04:25.999 --> 04:28.068
Of course I will come.

04:28.101 --> 04:30.538
(laughter)

04:30.571 --> 04:32.706
And thank you again,
Mrs. Haskins.

04:32.740 --> 04:33.707
Uh...
(sighs)
I-I know.

04:33.741 --> 04:34.875
But your husband is still

04:34.908 --> 04:36.043
my husband's boss,

04:36.076 --> 04:37.678
so "Mrs. Haskins"
just feels right.

04:37.711 --> 04:39.780
Well, if there's
anything else you need,

04:39.813 --> 04:40.714
don't hesitate to call.

04:43.050 --> 04:46.420
I know we haven't spent
much time together, Jess,

04:46.454 --> 04:48.722
but this unit's
a family,

04:48.756 --> 04:50.358
and you'll always
be a part of it.

05:19.119 --> 05:20.554
(blows landing, Crank groaning)

05:35.469 --> 05:38.138
Hey. Hey, hey.
You all right?

05:38.171 --> 05:40.007
Not as all right as you.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.709
JIMMY:
I'm not the enemy here.

05:41.742 --> 05:44.545
Yeah?
They're not beating you.

05:44.578 --> 05:47.147
You're speaking Arabic
to 'em all the time.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.916
For all I know, you're having
Muslim tea parties over there.

05:48.949 --> 05:50.017
Shh, shh, shh.

05:50.050 --> 05:51.852
I have a plan, okay?

05:51.885 --> 05:53.454
As long as they keep us apart,
we have no chance

05:53.487 --> 05:54.021
of getting out of here.
Shh.

06:18.145 --> 06:21.515
I won't eat unless you start
feeding us the same.

06:37.931 --> 06:40.133
CRANK:
That's your plan?

06:40.167 --> 06:44.137
They're gonna beat you
as bad as they do me.

06:44.171 --> 06:46.474
Yeah?

06:46.507 --> 06:48.509
I guess we'll find out.

06:50.511 --> 06:52.012
(moaning)

06:55.983 --> 06:58.586
I got to say, we are
getting pretty good at this.

06:58.619 --> 07:01.889
Well, practice
makes perfect, huh?

07:01.922 --> 07:05.158
I don't mean
just the sex.

07:05.192 --> 07:06.727
I mean us.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.029
Us?

07:09.062 --> 07:11.865
Well, don't get your
panties in a bunch.

07:11.899 --> 07:14.134
I'm not proposing.

07:14.167 --> 07:17.538
I'm just saying I think
we get each other.

07:17.571 --> 07:19.172
I think so, too, sweetheart.

07:22.876 --> 07:25.513
Hey, there's something

07:25.546 --> 07:27.247
I wanted to talk to you about.

07:27.280 --> 07:28.916
You're gonna think
I'm crazy.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.552
(chuckles)
I already think
you're crazy.

07:31.585 --> 07:34.154
That's why I like you.

07:34.187 --> 07:36.724
What's up?

07:36.757 --> 07:38.191
I think I'm being watched.

07:38.225 --> 07:41.061
Followed, too.

07:41.094 --> 07:43.163
Ever since I got
you those files.

07:43.196 --> 07:44.865
Huh.

07:44.898 --> 07:46.700
Am I being paranoid?

07:46.734 --> 07:49.937
Yeah.
Yeah, probably.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.872
The next time you think
you see something,

07:51.905 --> 07:53.173
just let me know.

07:53.206 --> 07:54.274
All right?

07:54.307 --> 07:56.944
Copy that, soldier.

08:00.113 --> 08:01.515
(chuckles)

08:10.658 --> 08:13.761
Hey, you heading out?

08:13.794 --> 08:16.063
No.

08:16.096 --> 08:17.831
I'm glad you're still here.
I wanted to tell you

08:17.865 --> 08:19.132
before you heard
tomorrow morning.

08:21.234 --> 08:23.704
They said no.

08:23.737 --> 08:24.838
(softly):
Yeah.

08:24.872 --> 08:26.540
Yeah.

08:26.574 --> 08:28.876
The committee won't
approve it.

08:28.909 --> 08:32.145
A prisoner exchange is
too much of a political risk.

08:32.179 --> 08:33.914
Khalid's deadline is
in four days.
I know.

08:33.947 --> 08:35.783
And we are already working
on an alternate plan.

08:37.885 --> 08:39.052
Nora...

08:40.721 --> 08:41.254
(whispering):
Nora.

08:46.594 --> 08:48.762
I've got to get
back in there.

09:14.622 --> 09:17.157
Oh, no.

09:17.190 --> 09:18.592
What happened to the beer?
(laughs)

09:18.626 --> 09:20.828
You have money?
I don't have any...

09:20.861 --> 09:22.630
I don't have any money,
but Kev's loaded.

09:22.663 --> 09:24.064
He got an enlistment bonus.

09:24.097 --> 09:25.933
Not blowing it on booze.

09:25.966 --> 09:28.135
How about your dad?
Where's he at?

09:28.168 --> 09:30.738
I haven't seen him
in a few days, again.

09:30.771 --> 09:33.774
Man, your dad
is the boss.

09:33.807 --> 09:35.075
Like, he gets it done.

09:35.108 --> 09:37.010
You're kidding, right?

09:37.044 --> 09:37.911
I mean, the man makes
a good living.

09:37.945 --> 09:39.279
Selling oxy,

09:39.312 --> 09:41.949
when he's not
using it.

09:41.982 --> 09:43.183
See, this is why
I enlisted.

09:43.216 --> 09:44.852
To get out of
this crap town

09:44.885 --> 09:46.654
and make something
of myself.
(snickers)

09:46.687 --> 09:47.955
You sound like a commercial.

09:47.988 --> 09:49.790
Like, "Be all you can be."

09:49.823 --> 09:52.359
Get told what to do
every second of the day.

09:52.392 --> 09:54.928
Get sent to some desert to have
people try to kill you 24/7.

09:54.962 --> 09:56.363
So, what, after
graduation,

09:56.396 --> 09:58.766
you're just gonna stay
here and deal drugs

09:58.799 --> 09:59.767
like your dad-- is that it?

09:59.800 --> 10:00.734
(door opens)

10:05.005 --> 10:06.940
Bobby, Kevin, you can leave now.

10:08.008 --> 10:09.109
I'll call you later.

10:15.282 --> 10:16.316
I told you I don't like them
hanging around here.

10:19.186 --> 10:21.221
Mija, if you don't watch it,

10:21.254 --> 10:23.323
you're gonna end up like me.

10:29.930 --> 10:31.932
No, I'm not.

10:43.343 --> 10:46.346
GALLO: Some more cargo straps,
and, uh, top her off with fuel.
Yeah.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.883
Morning, sir.

10:49.917 --> 10:51.351
Hey, check this.

10:51.384 --> 10:54.087
Anna thinks she's
being followed.

10:54.121 --> 10:55.355
CIA?

10:55.388 --> 10:56.824
Yeah, sounds like it.

10:56.857 --> 10:58.826
This keeps getting crazier.

10:58.859 --> 11:00.193
You haven't told her
anything, have you?

11:00.227 --> 11:01.895
No, of course not.

11:01.929 --> 11:04.464
I didn't realize you guys
were still dating.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.934
I, I wouldn't call it dating,
but whatever it is...

11:06.967 --> 11:09.703
it's working.

11:09.737 --> 11:11.972
I'm happy for you.
Why are we even
talking about this?

11:12.005 --> 11:13.240
The point is,

11:13.273 --> 11:14.942
we need to be
more careful now.

11:14.975 --> 11:18.111
No more midnight visits.

11:18.145 --> 11:19.947
Our sources indicate this
as a possible location

11:19.980 --> 11:21.248
for Sergeants Kam and Hendrix.

11:21.281 --> 11:23.083
We're running with that.
It's gonna be

11:23.116 --> 11:24.384
a smash-and-grab operation.

11:24.417 --> 11:26.319
Two Black Hawks,
two Little Birds.

11:26.353 --> 11:27.988
With the prisoner exchange
off the table,

11:28.021 --> 11:29.056
this is our best shot,
especially now that

11:29.089 --> 11:32.059
there's only 72 hours
until that deadline expires.

11:32.092 --> 11:33.393
You said "possible location."

11:33.426 --> 11:35.162
How possible?

11:35.195 --> 11:38.165
Our analysts are putting
the probability at 30%.

11:38.198 --> 11:39.199
(murmuring)

11:40.467 --> 11:42.803
We got to do something
about this.

11:45.505 --> 11:47.074
A 30% chance is crazy.

11:47.107 --> 11:49.042
I could throw a dart
at a map of Puntland

11:49.076 --> 11:50.277
and get 30%.
Maybe if you
just explain

11:50.310 --> 11:53.146
to her how dangerous plan B is,
then she'll understand...

11:53.180 --> 11:55.515
PORTER: My mother doesn't
take orders from me.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.450
But she does have
a lot of clout.

11:57.484 --> 11:59.319
Simone Porter is
a political animal.

11:59.352 --> 12:01.721
She doesn't do anything
unless it helps her.

12:03.791 --> 12:05.192
(sighs):
The only way

12:05.225 --> 12:08.028
that she's gonna lobby
for a prisoner exchange

12:08.061 --> 12:10.063
is if she's getting
something valuable in return.

12:10.097 --> 12:11.364
So give her something.

12:11.398 --> 12:13.033
(ringtone plays)
(chuckles)

12:15.936 --> 12:17.404
What's wrong?

12:17.437 --> 12:19.539
It's Anna.

12:19.572 --> 12:20.340
Yeah.

12:24.377 --> 12:25.545
Ian.

12:25.578 --> 12:27.380
I will go to her again,

12:27.414 --> 12:29.282
but... (sighs)

12:29.316 --> 12:31.885
I don't think it's gonna help.

12:31.919 --> 12:33.753
Just try?

12:36.223 --> 12:37.791
Have a seat.

12:37.825 --> 12:40.393
This is really just
an informational meeting for me.

12:40.427 --> 12:41.795
Of course.

12:41.829 --> 12:43.130
Though confidentiality

12:43.163 --> 12:45.565
is of the utmost
importance to us.

12:45.598 --> 12:48.902
So, how exactly does this work?

12:48.936 --> 12:52.239
So, our company is
mostly hired on retainer

12:52.272 --> 12:53.573
for large corporations
to handle kidnapping

12:53.606 --> 12:55.208
and extortion scenarios.

12:55.242 --> 12:57.110
We very discreetly

12:57.144 --> 12:58.846
work out a way to
get the victim back

12:58.879 --> 12:59.913
for the right price.

12:59.947 --> 13:01.915
No police, no publicity.

13:01.949 --> 13:03.817
Do you even take
personal cases?

13:03.851 --> 13:05.452
It depends on the
circumstances.

13:05.485 --> 13:06.987
I should warn you,

13:07.020 --> 13:08.889
the cost can be substantial.

13:08.922 --> 13:10.924
But our success rate
is very high.

13:13.894 --> 13:15.462
I didn't tell them anything,
but they said they'd wait

13:15.495 --> 13:17.965
in case I changed my mind.
Whoa, Anna, slow down.

13:17.998 --> 13:19.532
Wait. Where?

13:19.566 --> 13:21.368
These two guys came to the door.

13:21.401 --> 13:23.203
They wanted to know
about our relationship.

13:23.236 --> 13:25.105
If you've shared any
classified material with me.

13:25.138 --> 13:28.008
Which you haven't--
I told them that.

13:28.041 --> 13:29.009
And then what happened?

13:29.042 --> 13:30.477
They just got back
in their car.

13:31.945 --> 13:33.513
I'll be right back.

13:35.048 --> 13:36.816
It's gonna be fine.

13:44.457 --> 13:45.525
Hey!

13:45.558 --> 13:47.160
Jackass!

13:48.962 --> 13:50.130
(tires screech)

13:52.432 --> 13:55.435
You leave her out
of this, okay?

13:55.468 --> 13:58.438
You guys got questions
for me, you come to me.

13:58.471 --> 13:59.639
Are you done?
No.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.308
You bother her again,

14:01.341 --> 14:03.176
you and I are gonna have
a big problem.

14:03.210 --> 14:05.178
You're CIA, right?

14:05.212 --> 14:06.646
You working for Officer Thea?

14:06.679 --> 14:08.515
Why don't you pass
this message on

14:08.548 --> 14:09.382
to her, too.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.119
Now we're done.

14:15.622 --> 14:17.190
*

14:25.298 --> 14:27.267
(classical music playing)

14:27.300 --> 14:28.435
(knocking)

14:28.468 --> 14:30.603
Come.

14:30.637 --> 14:33.941
Colonel, I hope
I'm not interrupting.

14:33.974 --> 14:35.642
What can I do for you?

14:35.675 --> 14:38.445
Jimmy Kam's wife
recently contacted

14:38.478 --> 14:40.447
Extreme Crisis Solutions,

14:40.480 --> 14:42.215
a private ransom
negotiation firm,

14:42.249 --> 14:43.650
about getting
her husband back.

14:43.683 --> 14:45.986
And you know this how?

14:46.019 --> 14:47.620
Ever since Sergeant Kam
called her,

14:47.654 --> 14:49.522
we've been monitoring
her phone and laptop.

14:49.556 --> 14:53.226
If he ever reaches out again,
we'd want to know immediately.

14:53.260 --> 14:55.028
Surveillance is what
the Agency does best, Colonel.

14:55.062 --> 14:57.097
If only I could tap
every phone I wanted to.

14:58.665 --> 15:00.467
If you don't mind,

15:00.500 --> 15:04.237
it's a home run ball
hit by Hank Aaron.

15:04.271 --> 15:05.538
(exhales)

15:05.572 --> 15:07.574
I'm gonna need you
to talk to her.

15:07.607 --> 15:10.077
Because I think
we both understand

15:10.110 --> 15:12.079
how big of a problem this is.

15:12.112 --> 15:14.281
It could compromise
the entire operation.

15:14.314 --> 15:16.283
Might take a lighter touch
than mine,

15:16.316 --> 15:19.052
but it will be taken care of.

15:20.353 --> 15:22.222
Thank you, Colonel.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.157
Look at us agreeing.

15:24.191 --> 15:27.094
Doesn't that feel good
to finally be on the same page?

15:27.127 --> 15:29.062
Hmm.

15:29.096 --> 15:31.164
Feels amazing.

15:34.201 --> 15:37.104
PORTER:
A prisoner exchange is our
best shot at getting them back.

15:37.137 --> 15:39.172
There must be
something

15:39.206 --> 15:40.974
you can do.

15:41.008 --> 15:43.143
(sighs) A lot of arms
would have to be twisted,

15:43.176 --> 15:45.278
a lot of political capital
would have to be spent

15:45.312 --> 15:46.613
to get this revisited.

15:46.646 --> 15:48.115
I'm not sure that's wise.

15:48.148 --> 15:51.118
Who cares if it's wise, Mom?
It's right.

15:51.151 --> 15:53.553
If the exchange turns out
to be a disaster,

15:53.586 --> 15:55.622
it could blow back on me.

15:55.655 --> 15:59.392
Are you sure you don't
want to stay for dinner?

15:59.426 --> 16:01.761
Can't remember the last time
we had a meal together.
We both know

16:01.794 --> 16:03.096
that never goes well.

16:03.130 --> 16:05.332
I find that very
hurtful, Ian.

16:08.135 --> 16:11.138
This is about two men's lives.

16:12.705 --> 16:14.441
Does that really
not matter to you?

16:17.477 --> 16:19.379
(softly):
Okay.

16:19.412 --> 16:22.349
I'll make some calls.

16:22.382 --> 16:24.584
But...

16:24.617 --> 16:27.220
Oh, here it is.
(scoffs)
I'll need something

16:27.254 --> 16:29.122
in return from you.

16:29.156 --> 16:31.358
The way the CIA has
been running things

16:31.391 --> 16:33.593
hasn't exactly bolstered
my trust in them.

16:33.626 --> 16:36.729
I have particular questions
about Officer Thea.

16:36.763 --> 16:40.100
Drives me crazy how the
CIA never use last names.

16:40.133 --> 16:42.102
Yeah, it's a security thing, Ma.
I know,

16:42.135 --> 16:44.704
but still.

16:44.737 --> 16:47.140
I want copies of all the e-mails

16:47.174 --> 16:49.209
Thea has sent
since she's been on base.

16:49.242 --> 16:51.044
(chuckles):
You're kidding me.

16:51.078 --> 16:52.312
You work in intel.

16:52.345 --> 16:55.048
You have training
in cyber operations.

16:55.082 --> 16:57.250
Oh, just-just
to be clear,

16:57.284 --> 17:01.421
you want me to hack
into a CIA officer's e-mails?

17:02.722 --> 17:04.657
What happens if I get caught?

17:04.691 --> 17:06.259
You're too good to get caught.

17:06.293 --> 17:08.595
(exhales)

17:10.230 --> 17:12.632
This is about two men's lives.

17:16.536 --> 17:19.572
Two guys were trying to scare
Anna into talking last night.

17:19.606 --> 17:22.075
She didn't say anything
to 'em, but I did.

17:22.109 --> 17:24.577
You don't have to be a
cowboy 24/7, you know.

17:24.611 --> 17:26.413
It's my fault
they're watching her.

17:26.446 --> 17:29.182
I don't know how much longer
I can put her through this.

17:29.216 --> 17:32.352
I don't think they're
gonna stop, Gallo.

17:32.385 --> 17:34.687
Yeah. Okay, last thing--
mission business.

17:34.721 --> 17:36.389
Yeah.
If we do hit

17:36.423 --> 17:38.591
zero visibility over Puntland,

17:38.625 --> 17:40.693
I want you taking the controls.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.529
I mean, I'm good
at instrument flying,

17:42.562 --> 17:45.165
but... you are badass.

17:45.198 --> 17:47.200
You know it kills me
to say it.

17:49.269 --> 17:50.537
Hey.

17:50.570 --> 17:52.071
You with me?

17:53.573 --> 17:55.808
Yeah. Yeah, of course.
Okay, good.

17:57.444 --> 17:59.246
I'll meet you at the colonel's.

17:59.279 --> 18:01.548
Oh, the barbecue.
I forgot.

18:01.581 --> 18:03.383
Hey, in the meantime,

18:03.416 --> 18:06.319
go drum or, you know, do
what you do to get ready.

18:06.353 --> 18:09.122
You got to be on your
game for this mission.

18:09.156 --> 18:10.790
We both do.

18:14.161 --> 18:16.529
(up-tempo drumbeat playing)

18:24.504 --> 18:26.439
(panting)

18:38.951 --> 18:40.787
(panting)

18:49.796 --> 18:51.364
Bobby?

18:51.398 --> 18:53.866
Hey. It's Nora.

18:53.900 --> 18:56.736
Yeah. Yeah, I know, I know.
It's been a long time.

18:56.769 --> 19:00.573
Um... listen,
I think I might need a favor.

19:00.607 --> 19:03.910
I had a prescription,
but it's done.

19:03.943 --> 19:05.612
And, uh...

19:05.645 --> 19:07.814
I need help.

19:09.716 --> 19:12.252
Thank you all for coming.

19:12.285 --> 19:14.354
It's important to recognize

19:14.387 --> 19:16.556
our soldiers' birthdays,
even if we do cram

19:16.589 --> 19:19.592
a month's worth into one day.

19:19.626 --> 19:21.494
So happy birthday.

19:21.528 --> 19:23.230
(whooping)

19:26.833 --> 19:28.335
I appreciate y'all coming
to celebrate.

19:28.368 --> 19:30.470
Especially since
it gives me a chance

19:30.503 --> 19:32.605
to show off my skills
at the grill. Right, babe?

19:32.639 --> 19:34.974
Okay, wrap it up.
These people want to eat.
All right,

19:35.007 --> 19:36.609
well, y'all heard the boss.

19:36.643 --> 19:37.944
Your orders are simple--
you eat a lot

19:37.977 --> 19:39.479
and you have a great time.

19:39.512 --> 19:40.947
(music playing)

19:44.451 --> 19:46.185
*

19:48.788 --> 19:50.923
Hi.

19:50.957 --> 19:52.825
Hey there.

19:52.859 --> 19:54.894
You doing okay
with all this?

19:54.927 --> 19:57.430
Yeah. It's good for Max

19:57.464 --> 19:59.499
to be with other kids.
(laughing)

19:59.532 --> 20:02.235
And I'm having a pretty
good time, too, actually.

20:02.269 --> 20:03.936
You seem to be
doing better.

20:03.970 --> 20:07.274
I've decided that
I can't keep waiting

20:07.307 --> 20:09.542
for other people
to help me through this.

20:09.576 --> 20:11.744
I need to do it on my own.

20:11.778 --> 20:13.913
Yeah.

20:13.946 --> 20:16.249
I know how that feels.

20:17.984 --> 20:20.219
MAX:
Mom, come here.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.466
(pills rattling in bottle)

20:35.868 --> 20:36.969
What's going on?

20:38.605 --> 20:40.039
I'm sorry, hija.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.941
I have to get out of town.

20:41.974 --> 20:42.975
Work went south.

20:50.617 --> 20:52.952
Were you even gonna tell me
you were going?

20:52.985 --> 20:55.021
If I hadn't come home in time?

20:55.054 --> 20:57.690
Of course I was, hija.

20:57.724 --> 20:59.659
But like you said,

20:59.692 --> 21:02.929
you're 18 now--
you can make your own choices.

21:15.542 --> 21:18.345
We'll be in touch when
things settle down.

21:20.613 --> 21:22.749
*

21:30.990 --> 21:32.525
(door opens)

21:34.461 --> 21:36.363
(door bangs shut)

21:45.605 --> 21:46.873
(stammering)

21:52.845 --> 21:54.814
(yells)

21:54.847 --> 21:56.383
Wait...

21:56.416 --> 21:58.385
Please...

21:59.652 --> 22:01.621
(shouts)

22:04.824 --> 22:06.459
(screaming)

22:14.767 --> 22:17.370
When you are offered
a gift of food,

22:17.404 --> 22:21.107
you must be grateful
and accept it.

22:21.140 --> 22:23.610
Otherwise you insult your host.

22:23.643 --> 22:26.078
I do not like to be insulted.

22:26.112 --> 22:28.881
So...

22:28.915 --> 22:30.483
there will be no more food
for a while.

22:41.428 --> 22:43.930
(coughing)

22:43.963 --> 22:45.832
Jimmy.

22:45.865 --> 22:47.066
(door closes)

22:47.099 --> 22:49.736
I know you did
this for me.

22:49.769 --> 22:53.573
But it didn't help anything.

23:01.981 --> 23:05.017
Looks like a great party
over here.

23:05.051 --> 23:07.420
(laughs softly)

23:07.454 --> 23:09.522
Hey, any updates from your mom?

23:09.556 --> 23:11.824
No. She is still working on it.

23:11.858 --> 23:13.493
How about you?

23:13.526 --> 23:15.495
You waiting on a call
from the president?

23:15.528 --> 23:16.929
Huh?

23:16.963 --> 23:18.898
Oh, no, sorry. Just
waiting to hear back

23:18.931 --> 23:19.932
from a friend.

23:19.966 --> 23:22.001
COOGAN:
Here they are.

23:22.034 --> 23:24.003
The pride of the Shadow Raiders.

23:24.036 --> 23:25.204
What's going on, guys?

23:25.237 --> 23:27.073
GALLO:
Yeah, I'm just...

23:27.106 --> 23:29.075
so glad you could
make it today, Coogan.

23:29.108 --> 23:31.043
Just wanted to wish us
good luck. Come on.

23:31.077 --> 23:33.580
Okay.

23:33.613 --> 23:36.549
And I wanted to ask
a question, too.

23:36.583 --> 23:37.984
What really happened in Somalia
with you two?

23:39.085 --> 23:40.186
PORTER:
Hey, Staff Sergeant.

23:40.219 --> 23:42.121
(chuckles)
You had too much to drink.

23:42.154 --> 23:43.456
Don't you forget
who outranks who here.

23:43.490 --> 23:44.223
Wait, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

23:44.256 --> 23:46.693
What was it, six days?

23:46.726 --> 23:49.095
And we're just supposed
to believe that you two

23:49.128 --> 23:51.631
didn't rub each other's bodies
together to keep warm?

23:51.664 --> 23:53.866
Watch it, Coogan.
I'm just saying,
I don't care,

23:53.900 --> 23:54.834
I just don't want it
affecting our work,

23:54.867 --> 23:56.836
'cause I need to trust that you

23:56.869 --> 23:58.037
and you,

23:58.070 --> 23:59.572
got my ass.

23:59.606 --> 24:02.008
And not just each other's.

24:02.041 --> 24:03.710
GALLO: Hey! Hey.
Get out of my face, Coogan!

24:03.743 --> 24:06.045
PORTER: You're going after
two officers, Coogan.

24:06.078 --> 24:07.547
You want to be charged
with misconduct?

24:07.580 --> 24:09.716
Hey, hey, that's enough.
Don't let him get to you.

24:09.749 --> 24:11.684
He's just trying to push
your buttons.
HASKINS:
That's enough.

24:11.718 --> 24:13.520
Yeah, well, it's working.
Now, you got issues,
you work them out

24:13.553 --> 24:15.054
somewhere else, not in my yard.
But you will work them out.

24:15.087 --> 24:16.523
Is that clear?

24:16.556 --> 24:17.557
Lima Charlie?

24:17.590 --> 24:18.658
Yes, sir.

24:18.691 --> 24:19.759
Loud and clear.

24:20.793 --> 24:21.794
Sir.

24:22.962 --> 24:25.632
(phone ringing)

24:25.665 --> 24:26.566
HASKINS:
Are you coming, Nora?

24:27.900 --> 24:30.236
I'm all right.
I got to take this.

24:30.269 --> 24:31.704
*

24:31.738 --> 24:34.541
Sir, I'm good. I'm good.

24:36.142 --> 24:38.545
(phone continues ringing)

24:38.578 --> 24:40.179
MADANI:
Hey, Bobby.

24:40.212 --> 24:42.148
Yeah.

24:43.950 --> 24:45.718
Kevin can help?

24:45.752 --> 24:48.955
All right. Thanks.
I'll be right there.

24:51.290 --> 24:53.225
MADANI:
Kevin?

24:56.896 --> 24:58.164
Hey.

24:58.197 --> 25:00.166
(exhales)

25:01.634 --> 25:03.670
You look good.

25:03.703 --> 25:05.538
So do you.

25:05.572 --> 25:07.874
No, I don't.

25:07.907 --> 25:09.842
(chuckles softly)
I look like a guy

25:09.876 --> 25:11.243
that sells drugs for a living.

25:13.045 --> 25:16.015
Bet you never thought
I'd be the one here,

25:16.048 --> 25:18.918
while Bobby's got the family
and the job.

25:21.153 --> 25:22.288
He said you could help me?

25:24.691 --> 25:26.325
You still in the service?

25:26.358 --> 25:28.260
Ten years.

25:28.294 --> 25:29.862
Got to admit,

25:29.896 --> 25:31.731
I was, um...
(laughs softly)

25:31.764 --> 25:33.766
I was shocked
when I heard you enlisted.

25:33.800 --> 25:38.705
Yeah, well, life takes you down
strange paths, I guess, huh?

25:40.172 --> 25:42.174
Like coming to me
to buy painkillers?

25:45.945 --> 25:47.914
Thanks.
Come on in.

25:47.947 --> 25:50.149
So it really never bothers you

25:50.182 --> 25:53.085
that your husband can't tell you
more about what he does?

25:53.119 --> 25:55.221
Oh, it's the life I chose.

25:55.254 --> 25:57.690
But my husband does tell me
some things.

25:57.724 --> 25:59.726
And he...

25:59.759 --> 26:01.594
asked me to talk with you.

26:01.628 --> 26:04.130
About what?

26:04.163 --> 26:06.833
About a choice
you're considering.

26:06.866 --> 26:09.602
Do you really
want to risk

26:09.636 --> 26:12.238
compromising the plans
to save your husband?

26:15.975 --> 26:17.877
If Colonel Haskins
was over there...

26:19.178 --> 26:20.780
...wouldn't you do

26:20.813 --> 26:22.248
everything you could
to get him back?

26:22.281 --> 26:23.650
What I would do

26:23.683 --> 26:25.184
is have some faith in the army.

26:25.217 --> 26:27.720
Since our husbands
have devoted their lives to it.

26:27.754 --> 26:29.822
I mean, let's
face it.

26:29.856 --> 26:31.824
This country divided as it is,

26:31.858 --> 26:34.794
army's one of the only
institutions we can still trust.

26:37.830 --> 26:39.766
(speaking indistinctly)

26:48.040 --> 26:51.410
The shrapnel was still
in my shoulder,

26:51.443 --> 26:55.314
and I could barely move it, so
they gave me an early discharge.

26:55.347 --> 26:59.151
The pain was bad,
I got hooked on the pills,

26:59.185 --> 27:00.853
and well,

27:00.887 --> 27:02.288
now, here we are.

27:02.321 --> 27:04.290
I'm sorry.

27:04.323 --> 27:06.292
That's not gonna
happen to me.

27:06.325 --> 27:08.060
Maybe.

27:08.094 --> 27:09.896
Maybe not.

27:15.935 --> 27:17.804
They help with
other things, too.

27:17.837 --> 27:19.706
Of course.

27:19.739 --> 27:21.207
Not just the pain.

27:21.240 --> 27:22.675
Yeah.

27:24.343 --> 27:27.680
Joining the army's
the best thing I ever did.

27:27.714 --> 27:29.916
But it can be brutal.

27:29.949 --> 27:31.283
Physically

27:31.317 --> 27:33.119
and mentally.

27:33.152 --> 27:35.888
You can go one of
two ways with that.

27:35.922 --> 27:37.724
I don't want you to go mine.

27:37.757 --> 27:39.425
Which is why

27:39.458 --> 27:42.128
I'm not gonna
sell you these.

27:42.161 --> 27:43.462
What?

27:43.495 --> 27:45.798
Kevin, no-- listen.

27:45.832 --> 27:48.400
I have to do a certain kind of
flying-- it's instrument-only--

27:48.434 --> 27:52.371
and... it's what
everyone looks to me for.

27:52.404 --> 27:54.173
People could die

27:54.206 --> 27:56.843
if I'm not on top of my game.

27:56.876 --> 27:59.846
And, and right now, these pills
are what get me there.
No. Nora. Nora.

27:59.879 --> 28:01.814
No.

28:01.848 --> 28:03.015
(sirens wailing in distance)

28:03.049 --> 28:05.484
Please.

28:05.517 --> 28:09.121
Just this one time.

28:13.225 --> 28:15.261
(sighs)

28:15.294 --> 28:17.964
Don't come back to me,

28:17.997 --> 28:19.799
'cause I won't do this again.

28:35.081 --> 28:37.817
I thought we had
a good thing going here.

28:37.850 --> 28:39.185
I'm not looking
for anything more.

28:39.218 --> 28:41.120
I know that.

28:41.153 --> 28:43.055
Then I don't get this.
Look. Let's not make it

28:43.089 --> 28:45.191
harder than it has to be.

28:45.224 --> 28:47.059
All right?

28:47.093 --> 28:51.197
I just want to know why.

28:51.230 --> 28:52.965
(sighs)

28:56.402 --> 28:58.370
I guess I'm just not
feeling it anymore.

28:58.404 --> 28:59.906
(stifled laugh)

28:59.939 --> 29:01.908
(phone chimes)

29:06.478 --> 29:08.280
You got to go, huh?

29:08.314 --> 29:10.482
Yeah, I do.

29:10.516 --> 29:13.352
Emergency briefing.

29:13.385 --> 29:16.255
Hey.

29:18.190 --> 29:19.758
I'm sorry.

29:27.199 --> 29:29.135
(door opens, closes)

29:32.104 --> 29:34.440
Ladies and gentlemen,
the commander.

29:36.943 --> 29:38.510
All right, take a seat.

29:38.544 --> 29:41.247
Thanks to some
backchanneling

29:41.280 --> 29:44.516
by Lieutenant Porter,
the prisoner exchange is a go.

29:44.550 --> 29:47.053
But we're up against
the clock here.

29:47.086 --> 29:48.921
So you'll board the
C-17 for Somalia

29:48.955 --> 29:50.556
as soon as this briefing's over.
I will be joining
you in the field

29:50.589 --> 29:53.192
for this deployment.

29:53.225 --> 29:55.061
It's my ass on the line
if the exchange goes poorly;

29:55.094 --> 29:56.863
I'm gonna be there to manage it.

29:56.896 --> 29:58.530
This is Khalid's brother.

29:58.564 --> 30:01.100
He's currently being transported
from a black site

30:01.133 --> 30:03.135
to Camp Lemonnier in Somalia.

30:03.169 --> 30:07.073
He's not in good health
after years of CIA captivity.

30:07.106 --> 30:08.440
From Lemonnier,
you will transport him

30:08.474 --> 30:10.542
to a meeting
with Khalid's negotiator.

30:10.576 --> 30:12.411
And it'll happen here,

30:12.444 --> 30:15.314
at a small airstrip at the base
of the Golis Mountains.

30:15.347 --> 30:17.483
Khalid has demanded that we have
one helicopter at the airstrip.

30:17.516 --> 30:19.551
That'll be Captain Gallo's
and Ms. Madani's.

30:19.585 --> 30:22.421
Ms. Madani is the best in
the unit at instrument flying.

30:22.454 --> 30:24.056
So given the weather,

30:24.090 --> 30:25.524
I want her getting
us into the LZ.

30:25.557 --> 30:26.893
Yes, sir.

30:26.926 --> 30:28.027
Let's get our boys back.

30:28.060 --> 30:29.161
ALL:
Hooah!

30:40.472 --> 30:42.341
So, uh...

30:42.374 --> 30:44.944
what'd you have to promise
your mom in exchange for this?

30:44.977 --> 30:48.247
Nothing important.

30:51.918 --> 30:54.253
Come back to me safe.

30:56.555 --> 30:58.324
I will.

31:09.201 --> 31:12.504
It's your first time
on a military op, isn't it?

31:12.538 --> 31:14.340
You nervous?

31:14.373 --> 31:16.342
Well, no, they've got me
in the right outfit,

31:16.375 --> 31:18.410
so I guess I'm good to
go. No need to worry.

31:18.444 --> 31:20.146
I'll tell you
what does worry me.

31:20.179 --> 31:22.181
You having me tailed.

31:22.214 --> 31:23.950
I'm willing
to bet a bundle

31:23.983 --> 31:25.684
it was you sent those two goons
to my friend's place.

31:25.717 --> 31:27.353
Not sure what you're
talking about, Captain.

31:27.386 --> 31:30.022
Look, now I know
I'm being followed,

31:30.056 --> 31:31.991
I won't be followed.

31:32.024 --> 31:34.060
You catch my drift?

31:34.093 --> 31:35.928
You got questions, you ask me.

31:35.962 --> 31:37.329
There's no need
for this cloak-and-dagger.

31:40.967 --> 31:43.235
I'm gonna assume that silence
means we're good.

31:43.269 --> 31:46.272
No. No, we're not good.

31:46.305 --> 31:48.941
Okay, I read your debrief,
and Ms. Madani's.

31:48.975 --> 31:50.442
And what you said about
those six days in Somalia,

31:50.476 --> 31:52.378
that could not have sounded
more rehearsed.

31:52.411 --> 31:54.546
You even used
some of the same language.

31:54.580 --> 31:57.283
Not many different ways
to say the word "crash."

31:59.185 --> 32:02.188
We can end all this
very easily, Captain.

32:02.221 --> 32:03.589
You just need
to tell me

32:03.622 --> 32:05.224
what really happened over there.

32:06.658 --> 32:08.227
We already did.

32:14.666 --> 32:16.402
(plane passing by overhead)

32:39.458 --> 32:41.393
Hey.

32:41.427 --> 32:44.630
Hey.
(sighs)

32:44.663 --> 32:46.632
(clears throat)

32:46.665 --> 32:48.234
How'd it go with Thea?

32:48.267 --> 32:49.235
Yeah, she's just fishing.

32:51.570 --> 32:53.539
Probably gonna turn
up the heat, though.

32:53.572 --> 32:56.408
She still following Anna?
Nah, I doubt it.

32:56.442 --> 32:59.111
I ended things.

32:59.145 --> 33:02.214
It's the only way I could make
sure they'd leave her alone.

33:02.248 --> 33:04.483
Sorry to hear.

33:04.516 --> 33:07.019
Thought you started
to like her.

33:07.053 --> 33:09.788
You know, you're the last person
I want to talk to about this.

33:09.821 --> 33:11.723
And yet you still do.

33:17.729 --> 33:19.498
I'm gonna get some rest.

33:19.531 --> 33:20.799
Hey.

33:20.832 --> 33:23.169
Just think:

33:23.202 --> 33:25.371
if all goes well,

33:25.404 --> 33:28.006
36 hours from now,
we'll have Jimmy back.

33:29.408 --> 33:31.343
It wil go well.

33:42.121 --> 33:43.455
WOMAN:
Hey.

33:46.725 --> 33:49.528
You okay?

33:50.596 --> 33:52.198
I'm fine.

33:52.231 --> 33:53.832
Just fell asleep.
I'm moving.

33:53.865 --> 33:56.735
You smell like
you drank a keg.

33:56.768 --> 33:58.704
Yeah, I went out
with some friends,

33:58.737 --> 34:01.373
and... didn't quite
make it home.

34:02.708 --> 34:05.344
What kind of a cop
are you, anyway?

34:05.377 --> 34:07.613
(chuckles softly)
I'm not.

34:07.646 --> 34:09.715
I work at the recruitment center
a few blocks from here.

34:09.748 --> 34:10.816
Right.

34:17.589 --> 34:20.159
Thanks for getting me up.

34:20.192 --> 34:22.328
Is there anyone I
can call for you?

34:22.361 --> 34:23.595
Family?

34:23.629 --> 34:25.464
No. (sniffles)

34:25.497 --> 34:28.200
There's definitely no one
you can call for me.

34:29.568 --> 34:32.304
Maybe you want to come
in, chat sometime?

34:32.338 --> 34:33.639
(chuckles)

34:33.672 --> 34:36.542
I'm not exactly
army material, lady.

34:36.575 --> 34:38.644
Maybe you just need
a fresh start.

34:38.677 --> 34:40.746
We're good at those.

34:43.382 --> 34:45.117
*

34:55.427 --> 34:57.163
(door bangs open)

34:57.896 --> 34:59.231
(grunts in pain)

35:03.335 --> 35:04.836
No. No.

35:08.240 --> 35:10.376
(panting):
Thank you for doing this.

35:10.409 --> 35:14.346
Hurting you before
was not my choice.

35:20.319 --> 35:21.320
This is for you.

35:27.926 --> 35:30.629
Hey. What just happened?

35:30.662 --> 35:33.499
I convinced him that
us being here together

35:33.532 --> 35:35.501
will keep us healthy.

35:35.534 --> 35:36.568
(panting)

35:36.602 --> 35:38.304
Dead Americans...

35:38.337 --> 35:41.573
aren't as valuable
as living ones.

35:41.607 --> 35:44.443
I guess he got Khalid to agree.

35:44.476 --> 35:45.644
When'd you do that?

35:45.677 --> 35:47.246
You know...

35:47.279 --> 35:48.814
at one of our
"Muslim tea parties."

35:50.649 --> 35:54.653
I guess you
actually did have a plan.

35:54.686 --> 35:56.755
Now we need another one.

35:56.788 --> 35:59.691
A way to get out of here.

35:59.725 --> 36:03.195
But it'll be a lot easier
now that we're together.

36:03.229 --> 36:05.897
(panting)

36:05.931 --> 36:07.933
You did good, rotor-head.

36:09.668 --> 36:11.903
I think...

36:11.937 --> 36:13.872
that today...

36:13.905 --> 36:16.475
might be my birthday.

36:18.277 --> 36:20.279
(laughing)

36:20.312 --> 36:22.348
(groans)
(laughs)

36:22.381 --> 36:24.316
(both laughing)

36:25.617 --> 36:27.419
Happy birthday.

36:27.453 --> 36:29.788
(laughing)

36:29.821 --> 36:32.424
I'm sure this is exactly
how you planned spending it.

36:32.458 --> 36:33.692
Yeah.

36:35.527 --> 36:37.496
*

36:47.839 --> 36:50.342
Thanks for seeing me.
Of course.

36:50.376 --> 36:52.711
So you've thought more
about our conversation?
Yeah.

36:52.744 --> 36:55.814
I don't want to move ahead.

36:55.847 --> 36:58.617
I see. Is it
the expense, or...?

36:58.650 --> 37:00.786
I did some thinking.

37:00.819 --> 37:03.955
I decided to
put my trust

37:03.989 --> 37:07.793
in the people that my husband
trusts with his life.

37:07.826 --> 37:10.296
Feels like the
right thing to do.

37:10.329 --> 37:13.565
And you're positive
this is what you want?

37:13.599 --> 37:17.336
Because you could have told me
all of this in a phone call.

37:17.369 --> 37:19.638
These days, this is the only way
that I can be sure

37:19.671 --> 37:21.607
that no one else is listening.

37:40.592 --> 37:43.061
MADANI:
So that's Khalid's brother.

37:43.094 --> 37:45.831
Hard to believe this one
guy could be the key
to getting Jimmy back.

37:45.864 --> 37:47.466
DARZI: He can barely walk.
We could use

37:47.499 --> 37:48.734
another hand back here.
You have the controls.

37:48.767 --> 37:50.602
I have the controls.

37:54.740 --> 37:56.542
COOGAN:
Almost time to do

37:56.575 --> 37:57.909
your magic flying, Madani.

38:09.020 --> 38:09.888
Move.

38:11.623 --> 38:13.859
All right, he's in.

38:21.032 --> 38:22.768
THEA:
We're ready to go.

38:22.801 --> 38:24.336
We're good to go, sir.

38:24.370 --> 38:25.771
Anchor Zero-Six,
this is Renegade One-Two.

38:25.804 --> 38:27.673
We have the package.

38:27.706 --> 38:29.741
Let's do this.

38:53.031 --> 38:55.734
*

38:55.767 --> 38:57.436
DARZI:
The fog's getting too thick.

38:57.469 --> 38:59.838
The NVGs are useless.

39:03.108 --> 39:05.076
You good to do this?

39:05.110 --> 39:07.012
Because if not,

39:07.045 --> 39:08.647
you need to tell me.
I have a prescription

39:08.680 --> 39:09.981
for those pills.
Still no way

39:10.015 --> 39:11.850
you should be taking them during
a flight.

39:11.883 --> 39:13.752
(exhales)
I'm squared away.

39:16.555 --> 39:18.924
I'm squared away, sir.

39:20.191 --> 39:22.394
You have the controls.

39:22.428 --> 39:24.830
I have the controls.

39:24.863 --> 39:26.164
Anchor Zero-Six,

39:26.197 --> 39:28.534
we're two hours out.
Any updates

39:28.567 --> 39:31.036
on the weather? Over.
Looks like the fog clears out

39:31.069 --> 39:33.905
in 40 miles-- just got
to hold out till then. Over.

39:33.939 --> 39:35.774
MADANI:
Roger that.

39:35.807 --> 39:38.176
Sir. Colonel Collins here
is gonna cover me for a moment.

39:38.209 --> 39:39.445
You mind if I run to the SCIF?

39:39.478 --> 39:40.746
All right, LT.

39:40.779 --> 39:43.782
Hammer One-One,
status report. Over.

39:43.815 --> 39:45.784
MAN:
Anchor O-Six.
We're 80 klicks out. Over.

39:45.817 --> 39:48.587
GALLO:
We're coming up
on a tricky area.

39:48.620 --> 39:50.556
A couple of mountain peaks.
Be careful.

39:50.589 --> 39:51.557
I got this, sir.

40:23.188 --> 40:25.824
*

40:54.520 --> 40:55.787
It's clearing up ahead.

40:55.821 --> 40:57.789
You got us through it.

40:57.823 --> 40:59.525
Told you I would.

40:59.558 --> 41:01.793
GALLO: Anchor Zero-Six,
weather has cleared.

41:01.827 --> 41:03.962
NVGs are back in business.

41:06.865 --> 41:07.899
(groans)

41:07.933 --> 41:08.767
Hey.

41:16.975 --> 41:17.709
He's not responding.

41:19.077 --> 41:21.212
(groaning, gasping)

41:21.246 --> 41:23.815
We got a problem back here. The
prisoner seems to be convulsing.

41:23.849 --> 41:26.985
"Seems" to be?
Uh, yeah. He could be faking it.
I don't know.

41:27.018 --> 41:28.787
It doesn't look like
he's faking it, sir.

41:28.820 --> 41:29.588
Get the CLS kit!
He's going into shock!

41:29.621 --> 41:31.590
GALLO:
What's happening back there?

41:31.623 --> 41:33.191
Nothing good, sir.

41:33.224 --> 41:34.960
Oh, God.
How bad is it?

41:34.993 --> 41:36.862
It's pretty bad.
I think he's dead.
