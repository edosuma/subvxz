00:04.471 --> 00:06.383
Whoa.

00:06.617 --> 00:07.918
Burn it all!

00:10.146 --> 00:11.480
Burn it out!

00:11.705 --> 00:13.448
Whoa!

00:13.449 --> 00:14.939
Let me show you my place, huh?

00:15.229 --> 00:16.947
Oh! I gotta tweet this.

00:17.317 --> 00:18.835
No one will believe I'm with...

00:18.836 --> 00:20.202
The terrific Nick.

00:20.364 --> 00:22.812
Mm. Uh, "authentic" Nick.

00:22.862 --> 00:24.629
Not "terrific," okay?

00:24.910 --> 00:27.630
I mean, uh... we're the best.

00:28.001 --> 00:28.972
I'll bet.

00:29.400 --> 00:30.908
And it smells so good.

00:32.458 --> 00:34.183
It does... smell good.

00:35.612 --> 00:36.762
Somebody here?

00:37.612 --> 00:38.456
Dad?

00:38.457 --> 00:40.546
It smells like ribs.
Is that barbecue pizza?

00:40.547 --> 00:42.337
No, we don't do barbecue pizza, all right?

00:42.338 --> 00:44.076
That's for the hacks like terrific Nick.

00:54.285 --> 00:56.252
Ooh, nice and crispy.

00:57.872 --> 00:59.935
Just the way you like it.

01:00.833 --> 01:02.327
You eat it. I'm not hungry.

01:03.099 --> 01:04.944
You've never said no to turkey bacon.

01:05.740 --> 01:06.405
What's wrong?

01:06.847 --> 01:08.191
Nothing. Something.

01:09.397 --> 01:10.913
Don't make me tong you.

01:13.425 --> 01:15.815
Not even a smile. Must be serious.

01:15.898 --> 01:18.793
It's Lauren's birthday party.
I'm not going.

01:18.916 --> 01:20.907
What? You been talking about
that party for weeks.

01:20.908 --> 01:22.603
"It's gonna be the party of the century."

01:22.604 --> 01:23.809
Yesterday Lauren came up to me,

01:23.810 --> 01:26.619
and in front of everybody,
told me I was disinvited.

01:27.262 --> 01:29.699
It was humiliating.
Why would Lauren do something like that?

01:29.700 --> 01:32.643
She's one of your best friends.
She was one of my best friends.

01:33.047 --> 01:34.581
I have no idea why she's acting like this,

01:34.582 --> 01:37.342
and she refuses to talk to me,
and Ashley's still invited,

01:37.343 --> 01:38.876
and so is everyone else.

01:39.976 --> 01:41.141
And it's like I'm a social leper.

01:41.231 --> 01:42.670
Well, Ashley's not gonna go without you.

01:42.671 --> 01:44.653
Just because I have leprosy
doesn't mean he should.

01:44.759 --> 01:46.541
Well, I think you should
throw a rival party

01:46.559 --> 01:48.270
and invite all your friends
to that one instead.

01:48.271 --> 01:50.667
The party's tonight, and she
has a live band performing.

01:50.668 --> 01:52.302
I can't compete with that. Well,

01:52.420 --> 01:53.791
then I'll call Lauren's mom, and I'll...

01:53.792 --> 01:54.548
you're joking, right?

01:54.806 --> 01:57.275
What, so I can be a leper and a tattletale?

01:58.362 --> 02:00.168
I'm 17. I can deal with this on my own.

02:01.315 --> 02:04.093
It's just... every instinct in my body

02:04.094 --> 02:05.644
is telling me to protect her.

02:05.869 --> 02:07.259
Yeah, but when it comes to teenagers,

02:07.260 --> 02:09.925
not even you can protect her.
Alexis is gonna have to deal

02:09.925 --> 02:11.387
with backstabbers her whole life.

02:11.388 --> 02:13.860
But she's intelligent enough
to rise above all of that.

02:13.974 --> 02:16.678
I don't know. She looked like
she was ready to commit murder.

02:18.275 --> 02:19.184
Speaking of murder.

02:20.251 --> 02:22.442
I thought terrific Nick's on
the east side was number one.

02:22.443 --> 02:24.739
Uh, no, that's authentic terrific Nick's.

02:24.853 --> 02:27.013
This is just authentic Nick's.
This isn't terrific?

02:27.022 --> 02:30.055
No, just authentic.
It's also not terrific authentic Nick's,

02:30.056 --> 02:32.046
but that's across the street.
What's the difference?

02:32.048 --> 02:34.600
The difference is, this one
has a dead body in the oven.

02:36.244 --> 02:37.210
O-kay.

02:39.079 --> 02:41.256
That is really... well-done.

02:41.257 --> 02:42.735
Another couple of hours, maybe,

02:42.736 --> 02:44.816
but luckily for me, he's only half-baked.

02:46.684 --> 02:50.014
Male, mid-40s, that's about
as much I.D. As I can give you.

02:50.103 --> 02:52.873
Based on the oven setting and
the body's core temperature,

02:52.874 --> 02:54.752
I'd say he went in no sooner than 2:00 A.M.

02:55.355 --> 02:56.937
I'm afraid to ask. Cause of death?

02:56.938 --> 02:59.246
It wasn't the oven.
The stab wound through the chest

02:59.247 --> 03:00.677
says he was dead when he went in.

03:03.002 --> 03:04.055
No sign of forced entry.

03:04.056 --> 03:06.176
But we're running the prints
on the door handle just the same.

03:06.666 --> 03:08.072
All right. Run 'em on the oven as well.

03:08.073 --> 03:10.481
Who found him? Uh, Nick Jr.

03:10.729 --> 03:11.863
Unbelievable. Give me his number.

03:11.864 --> 03:13.775
Authentic, not terrific.

03:15.411 --> 03:17.370
No. I got no idea who he is.

03:17.556 --> 03:19.523
I mean, I open up the oven,
and bam... there he is.

03:19.524 --> 03:21.891
And who were the last ones here last night?
My dad and me.

03:22.623 --> 03:23.611
We closed around 11:00,

03:23.757 --> 03:25.083
and then I hit up the Kaydar lounge,

03:25.180 --> 03:27.861
met up with a lady friend,
and then we came back here

03:27.910 --> 03:30.414
to, uh... have a slice.

03:31.562 --> 03:32.310
And when was that?

03:32.680 --> 03:34.614
I don't know. 4:30.

03:35.224 --> 03:37.833
Where's your lady friend now?
She was kinda throwing up a lot,

03:37.834 --> 03:39.207
so the paramedics had to take her in.

03:40.155 --> 03:41.305
Oh, but I kept her number.

03:45.506 --> 03:48.026
I-I don't think there's
gonna be a second date.

03:48.204 --> 03:49.282
Yeah, you're right. I'm sorry.

03:49.619 --> 03:51.426
I'm gonna need a list of
all of your employees

03:51.427 --> 03:53.209
and delivery staff. You don't

03:53.210 --> 03:55.073
think it was one of
our guys in the oven, do you?

03:55.443 --> 03:58.245
As soon as you get me that list,
I'll start making phone calls.

03:58.583 --> 04:00.990
Ohh. I don't believe this.

04:02.363 --> 04:04.112
You gotta be kidding me.

04:04.403 --> 04:06.393
Dad, these are the cops.

04:06.765 --> 04:08.176
You must be authentic Nick.

04:08.403 --> 04:10.418
The one and only. Nick?

04:10.419 --> 04:13.469
I have the proprietor
listed as Ralph Carbone.

04:13.470 --> 04:16.232
Yeah, that's me.
Everybody calls me Nick. Why?

04:16.303 --> 04:17.997
Because that's what everybody calls me.

04:18.127 --> 04:21.337
I can't believe those bastards
put a body in my oven.

04:21.579 --> 04:22.833
I'm sorry, Mr. Carbone.

04:22.834 --> 04:25.089
You think that you know who did this?
Yeah, sure.

04:25.667 --> 04:27.153
I'll bet it was that jackhole.

04:28.109 --> 04:29.417
Terrific authentic Nick?

04:29.660 --> 04:32.793
Sal Malavolta. He used to work
for us years ago before opening

04:32.794 --> 04:35.274
his own lousy pizza shop
right across the street.

04:35.439 --> 04:36.758
He stole my friggin' recipes.

04:36.759 --> 04:39.711
It's Sal that done this, along
with the other two. The other two?

04:39.712 --> 04:43.202
Yeah, that vulture there. Terrific Nick?

04:43.203 --> 04:45.555
Vinnie Delfino. And that dirtbag there.

04:45.556 --> 04:48.590
And authentic terrific Nick. Luca Sabalini.

04:49.056 --> 04:51.191
All three of them, they're thieves.

04:51.192 --> 04:54.017
They live off our name, and
they're not even real nicks.

04:54.018 --> 04:56.282
I'm the only real Nick.
And your real name is Ralph.

04:56.283 --> 04:59.194
Exactly. They been trying to
run me outta dodge for years.

04:59.195 --> 05:01.980
And now this.
Who's gonna buy my pizza now, huh?

05:01.981 --> 05:05.247
Hey! Hey! You happy? I'm outta business!

05:05.248 --> 05:08.263
Mr. Carbone, what makes you think
that one of them did this?

05:08.650 --> 05:10.417
A few weeks ago, one of them

05:10.931 --> 05:13.451
snuck a gallon of soap
into my secret sauce.

05:13.725 --> 05:15.672
Cost me a whole day of returned pies.

05:16.888 --> 05:19.778
Now look, uh, I may or
may not have retaliated,

05:19.779 --> 05:20.760
but if I did,

05:20.776 --> 05:22.807
them putting a cadaver in my oven

05:22.849 --> 05:25.031
that's, uh, them retaliating back.

05:25.184 --> 05:27.056
Mr. Carbone, that's not a cadaver.

05:27.178 --> 05:28.805
What do you mean? It's a... they bor...

05:28.806 --> 05:30.909
they... they got this from
some medical school.

05:31.096 --> 05:33.527
No, this isn't a prank. This is murder.

05:44.201 --> 05:45.668
We got through to all their employees.

05:45.775 --> 05:47.422
Everybody's accounted for. Lanie,

05:47.423 --> 05:48.932
what are the chances of getting an I.D.?

05:49.182 --> 05:51.261
I'm not hopeful on fingerprints.
We may have to wait

05:51.262 --> 05:52.491
for a missing persons report

05:52.492 --> 05:54.500
and dental records.
We also started a canvass

05:54.517 --> 05:55.963
to see if anybody saw anything last night.

05:55.964 --> 05:58.028
All right, let's get statements
off all the employees,

05:58.029 --> 05:59.258
especially the ones with keys.

05:59.259 --> 06:00.681
I'd like to know what they
were doing last night.

06:01.347 --> 06:02.390
Shouldn't we look into the other nicks,

06:02.391 --> 06:04.022
too? Come on, bro. You don't really think

06:04.023 --> 06:05.765
this is about some kind
of pizza rivalry, do you?

06:05.910 --> 06:08.655
Competition to be the best in
New York, clear animosity?

06:08.736 --> 06:10.309
Carbone said they'd broken in before.

06:10.472 --> 06:12.431
If we are looking into
everyone with access,

06:12.432 --> 06:13.582
we should look into them as well.

06:13.995 --> 06:14.605
He's right, you know?

06:15.228 --> 06:16.835
Pizza's serious business in this town.

06:17.149 --> 06:20.367
All right. Great.
You talk to them. Wait. Me?

06:20.368 --> 06:21.887
No, I... come on.

06:27.459 --> 06:29.489
You know, you have
to admit, a pizza oven...

06:29.676 --> 06:31.289
very clever way to get rid of a body.

06:31.459 --> 06:34.349
In "at dusk we die",
I had my psychotic paralegal

06:34.350 --> 06:36.757
kill her abusive boss and
put him in a pottery kiln.

06:36.806 --> 06:39.075
He was reduced to ashes
in a matter of hours.

06:39.076 --> 06:41.082
Of course, you already
know this, don't you?

06:41.534 --> 06:43.275
That's probably what
our killer planned on doing

06:43.276 --> 06:44.775
until Nick Jr. showed up. Did I hear right?

06:44.776 --> 06:47.183
You found a body in
the oven at terrific Nick's?

06:47.184 --> 06:49.601
Authentic Nick's. Authentic Nick's?

06:49.684 --> 06:51.667
Oh, thank God.
The wife loves terrific Nick's.

06:52.020 --> 06:52.912
I didn't have the heart

06:52.913 --> 06:54.671
to tell her it now came
in full-bodied flavor.

06:56.453 --> 06:58.603
Oh, I liked .. I liked it.

06:58.854 --> 06:59.385
Hey.

06:59.426 --> 07:02.540
So we ran through all
of authentic Nick's employees.

07:02.541 --> 07:05.445
They alibied out, but
I did find a bunch of stuff

07:05.446 --> 07:07.382
on the other nicks. Criminal complaints?

07:07.472 --> 07:10.457
Yeah, dozens of them filed
back and forth between

07:10.458 --> 07:13.316
all the nicks over the years...
bricks through front windows,

07:13.317 --> 07:17.320
slashed delivery car tires,
ooh, flaming bags of poo.

07:17.321 --> 07:18.461
Thank you. Yep.

07:20.450 --> 07:21.215
What, that's it?

07:22.877 --> 07:25.786
Flaming bags of poo, soap in secret sauces?

07:25.787 --> 07:26.954
Come on, Castle. What do you think,

07:26.955 --> 07:30.205
these guys suddenly graduated
from frat pranks to murder?

07:31.691 --> 07:32.293
Beckett.

07:32.615 --> 07:35.865
As expected, the body was
too badly burned to get any prints,

07:35.866 --> 07:38.010
but I did find this.

07:38.307 --> 07:40.932
You see here where the shin bone should be?

07:40.933 --> 07:42.315
Those are titanium plates.

07:42.316 --> 07:44.259
So killer cyborg sent from the future,

07:44.570 --> 07:46.223
resistance fighters
intercept his coordinates,

07:46.224 --> 07:48.703
redirect him into a pizza oven,
saving humanity.

07:49.548 --> 07:51.329
The plates have serial numbers.

07:51.330 --> 07:52.927
I ran 'em through the surgical database

07:52.928 --> 07:53.789
and got an I.D.

07:54.914 --> 07:55.773
Gordon burns.

07:56.770 --> 07:57.869
Gordon burns?

07:58.409 --> 08:00.384
Yes, Castle, burns.

08:00.385 --> 08:02.929
Go ahead, make your joke.
Get it out of your system.

08:02.930 --> 08:05.002
Gordon burns, as in "New York ledger"?
You know him?

08:05.003 --> 08:06.635
Well, not personally. He was a reporter.

08:06.636 --> 08:07.888
I used to love his work.

08:07.889 --> 08:09.222
Did you find anything else on the body?

08:09.592 --> 08:13.627
A melted cell phone belt clip,
but there was no cell phone.

08:14.126 --> 08:15.812
Yeah, it wasn't at the crime scene, either.

08:17.700 --> 08:18.929
And that's his wallet.

08:19.395 --> 08:20.160
Some credit cards,

08:20.899 --> 08:22.969
driver's license... that's all melted.

08:26.676 --> 08:27.511
Girlfriend, wife?

08:27.682 --> 08:29.960
Burns is listed
as divorced, no next of kin.

08:30.451 --> 08:33.443
He was a war correspondent,
an investigative reporter.

08:33.837 --> 08:35.845
What was he doing in a pizza oven?

08:36.696 --> 08:38.118
Maybe his editor knows.

08:39.234 --> 08:41.773
We were friends, so when
I became editor of the paper,

08:41.774 --> 08:44.863
he was my first hire.
The kinds of stories he wrote,

08:44.864 --> 08:46.733
he must have stepped
on his fair share of toes.

08:46.887 --> 08:49.628
Not for years.
He'd been out of the game for a while.

08:50.136 --> 08:50.706
Why is that?

08:52.956 --> 08:54.881
His kid was killed in an accident.

08:54.964 --> 08:57.572
She was 10. After that, he finally gave in

08:57.573 --> 08:59.274
to his love affair with the bottle.

08:59.422 --> 09:01.194
We see that you still
had him on the payroll.

09:01.237 --> 09:03.188
He did the occasional human interest story

09:03.189 --> 09:04.530
for our lifestyles section.

09:04.811 --> 09:08.727
A waste of his talent, but
it let him make rent,

09:08.728 --> 09:09.933
keep his insurance.

09:09.936 --> 09:12.760
Mr. Shaw, was he working
on anything recently?

09:13.618 --> 09:16.346
Just a puff piece I had assigned
him last week. About what?

09:16.757 --> 09:19.950
The pizza wars.
You know, those authentic, amazing,

09:20.009 --> 09:22.945
terrific guys always fighting
over which one's the best.

09:23.579 --> 09:26.309
It wasn't Afghanistan.
But Gordon was Gordon.

09:26.589 --> 09:28.783
He called a few days ago and
said it was much bigger

09:28.784 --> 09:30.505
than I thought. Bigger how?

09:30.680 --> 09:33.238
He didn't say, but I mean, it's pizza wars.

09:33.809 --> 09:36.747
How big could it be?
Big enough to kill for.

09:50.584 --> 09:52.520
Let's dig deeper into all of the nicks...

09:52.521 --> 09:54.544
terrific, authentic, and otherwise,

09:54.545 --> 09:55.991
and let's also run baground checks

09:55.992 --> 09:57.005
on all of their employees.

09:57.102 --> 09:59.117
You know, this guy survived Afghanistan,

09:59.382 --> 10:01.863
the invasion of Iraq,
*** Tienanmen square,

10:02.690 --> 10:04.834
to be killed doing a puff piece on pizza?

10:05.477 --> 10:06.697
It's like being a cop, bro.

10:06.989 --> 10:09.460
You survive a firefight
with a dozen armed gangbangers

10:09.461 --> 10:12.911
only to be hit by a car

10:14.427 --> 10:16.232
I ran a trace on *** phone.***

10:16.233 --> 10:18.257
It *** out of battery or f***

10:18.755 --> 10:20.334
all *** run l.U.U.S.Sd find

10:20.335 --> 10:22.694
find out *** he wand what
he was doing last night. On it.

10:23.641 --> 10:24.392
This has to be

10:24.400 --> 10:26.911
about something bigger
than who has the best pizza.

10:27.634 --> 10:29.265
You know, burns probably had notes

10:29.266 --> 10:31.714
and drafts of his story in his apartment.

10:31.715 --> 10:33.327
If we can find them, we can figure out

10:33.328 --> 10:35.457
what he was up to last night. Let's go.

10:40.526 --> 10:41.490
Door's been kicked open.

10:49.789 --> 10:50.481
Room's clear.

10:50.611 --> 10:52.249
This place is trashed.

10:53.381 --> 10:54.523
I'm gonna check with the neighbors,

10:54.524 --> 10:55.969
see if anybody heard anything. Okay.

10:59.346 --> 11:00.912
These drawers have been emptied.

11:01.033 --> 11:03.361
If there were files or notes,
they're gone now.

11:05.342 --> 11:06.628
Well, whatever he was working on,

11:06.629 --> 11:08.403
someone didn't want us to find it.

11:13.504 --> 11:14.119
You okay?

11:14.406 --> 11:15.555
Yeah. No, yeah.

11:15.556 --> 11:18.596
Um, I think I met her.

11:19.231 --> 11:21.744
I went to a book signing of his,
the one he did on the, uh,

11:21.761 --> 11:22.822
Sarajevo snipers.

11:23.593 --> 11:24.437
She was...

11:26.242 --> 11:29.228
Coloring next to him while
he was signing books.

11:30.104 --> 11:32.527
He must have been a good writer
for you to stand in line.

11:32.944 --> 11:34.724
Yeah. He was.

11:36.532 --> 11:37.767
Come on. Let's go get c.S.U.

11:38.145 --> 11:40.272
Hey. I got something weird.

11:40.282 --> 11:42.264
Burns' neighbor, she
says she's been holding

11:42.330 --> 11:44.859
his mail for the last week.
Apparently burns told her

11:44.860 --> 11:46.256
he was going out of
the country for a while.

11:46.330 --> 11:48.121
Out of the country? We know he's been here.

11:48.146 --> 11:49.672
You know, that's the kind
of lie that you tell people

11:49.673 --> 11:51.143
when you don't want anyone looking for you.

11:51.145 --> 11:52.365
And if he's been staying somewhere else,

11:52.366 --> 11:53.934
there's a chance we could
still find his notes.

11:53.935 --> 11:55.124
I'm gonna to get a hold of his editor,

11:55.125 --> 11:56.491
find out where he might have been staying.

11:56.492 --> 11:58.652
How does a story about pizza
send somebody into hiding?

11:58.653 --> 12:00.965
Or get them killed? Beckett.

12:01.216 --> 12:03.407
Hey. Just got the c.S.U. Report back.

12:03.408 --> 12:05.775
The back doorknob of
the pizza shop was wiped clean,

12:05.847 --> 12:08.897
but they did find Nick's prints
all over the pizza oven.

12:08.939 --> 12:11.587
Well, that's to be expected.
I mean, he worked there.

12:11.998 --> 12:15.040
Not authentic Nick. These prints belong to

12:15.041 --> 12:18.322
his neighbor across the street...
terrific authentic Nick.

12:18.323 --> 12:20.561
So, Nick, or should I say Sal?

12:20.868 --> 12:22.402
Know this guy? Yeah, I know him.

12:23.229 --> 12:25.093
That's the reporter doing the story on us.

12:25.094 --> 12:26.731
And what did the two of you talk about?

12:26.813 --> 12:27.697
Who's the real Nick,

12:27.739 --> 12:29.497
and I told him about my grandpa Nick

12:30.172 --> 12:32.613
and how he was an authentic
Ellis island immigrant

12:32.614 --> 12:34.323
who was flipping his terrific dough

12:34.349 --> 12:37.269
on Mott Street the very day he arrived.

12:37.584 --> 12:40.832
What else? That's it. Why?

12:41.284 --> 12:43.290
Just doesn't seem like a
good enough reason to kill.

12:43.725 --> 12:46.910
Kill? We found your fingerprints,
Sal, all over the oven.

12:47.280 --> 12:48.519
You found my prints?

12:48.623 --> 12:49.291
Yeah.

12:50.207 --> 12:54.050
So why don't we back up?
And you tell us why you killed burns.

12:54.051 --> 12:56.884
And this time, hold the extra cheese.
I-I can explain.

12:57.310 --> 13:00.078
I was there, but I didn't kill nobody.

13:00.481 --> 13:02.319
Ralph thought I was soaping his sauce,

13:02.320 --> 13:03.717
so he broke into my place

13:03.823 --> 13:06.038
and took all the breakers
out of my electrical panel.

13:06.618 --> 13:10.212
Now he's always bragging about
his oven, so I thought I'd...

13:10.213 --> 13:11.097
put a body in it.

13:11.868 --> 13:14.782
No, steal it.
I went over there a couple nights ago

13:14.783 --> 13:17.046
to see what I need to get it out.
You're kidding me, right?

13:17.345 --> 13:20.016
I was in O'Meary's
on Staten Island last night,

13:20.259 --> 13:21.207
till closing.

13:21.393 --> 13:23.919
Okay? It was dart night.
I took third place.

13:23.920 --> 13:27.172
You want to look at somebody,
look at Ralph. Why Ralph?

13:27.254 --> 13:29.765
What do you think, he makes that
money with his crappy pizza?

13:29.766 --> 13:32.494
He's connected. That's why I left.

13:32.576 --> 13:35.481
All he cares about is laundering
money for his wise guy pals.

13:35.675 --> 13:37.997
You didn't happen to mention
this to burns, did you?

13:39.199 --> 13:40.710
As a matter of fact, I did.

13:42.169 --> 13:43.784
Money laundering? Whoa.

13:43.785 --> 13:45.608
We ran you through the federal database.

13:45.609 --> 13:48.161
We know about the FBI
investigation in the '90s

13:48.162 --> 13:51.452
and about your connection to
the Spolano crime family.

13:52.046 --> 13:53.147
My connection?

13:54.111 --> 13:55.671
He's my second cousin once removed.

13:55.881 --> 13:57.967
I see him at Thanksgiving
once every five years.

13:58.186 --> 14:01.216
And the feds never found anything.
The feds didn't,

14:01.645 --> 14:02.989
but maybe burns did.

14:03.073 --> 14:06.480
So what happened, Ralph?
Did he threaten to expose you?

14:07.073 --> 14:11.187
You make him...
disappear until your... your kid showed up

14:11.188 --> 14:13.701
before that oven you're so
proud of could finish the job?

14:15.025 --> 14:16.817
I make money with my pizza.

14:16.914 --> 14:18.963
You want to look at my books? Go ahead.

14:19.065 --> 14:21.817
You're gonna find exactly
the same thing the feds found...

14:21.994 --> 14:23.757
nada, zip, zilch.

14:25.313 --> 14:28.097
Sal put yous two up to this, right?

14:28.717 --> 14:30.024
Sal's the one brought the feds in

14:30.025 --> 14:32.233
in the first place, trying to shut me down.

14:33.006 --> 14:34.622
You should be looking at him.

14:34.778 --> 14:37.610
Sal had an alibi for last night.

14:38.398 --> 14:39.572
What about you, Mr. Carbone?

14:39.573 --> 14:41.700
I'm at home in bed. You could ask my wife.

14:42.074 --> 14:45.033
And that reporter, all he
asked me about was pizza.

14:48.765 --> 14:50.636
That guy is guilty of something.

14:50.637 --> 14:52.428
Not until we have proof.

14:52.857 --> 14:56.316
Hey, Ryan. Any luck on where
our victim was last night?

14:56.317 --> 14:58.064
Well, we're still waiting
for info from his bank,

14:58.065 --> 15:01.024
but I got his luds. Nothing last night,

15:01.025 --> 15:02.516
and only a few calls to his editor

15:02.517 --> 15:05.425
in the previous days.
A reporter chasing down a story?

15:05.426 --> 15:06.888
No, there should be dozens of calls. Well,

15:06.889 --> 15:09.028
maybe he was making them from
wherever he was staying.

15:09.029 --> 15:10.578
Any leads on the girl in the photo?

15:10.579 --> 15:13.344
No. But I got in touch with
burns' ex in Portland.

15:13.478 --> 15:16.952
They hadn't seen each other in years.
Yo. Pay dirt.

15:17.303 --> 15:19.712
I canvassed burns' building.
At first, it was all,

15:19.713 --> 15:21.732
"he's so quiet. He just keeps to himself."

15:21.733 --> 15:23.557
But this other neighbor who just came home

15:23.558 --> 15:25.388
said that she saw burns
and another guy having

15:25.389 --> 15:27.763
a knock-down, drag-out yelling
match just before he left.

15:27.764 --> 15:30.772
About what? All she remembers
is the other guy yelling,

15:30.844 --> 15:33.492
"if you try to print that,
I swear to God, I'll kill ya!"

15:33.493 --> 15:34.885
Did you get a description?

15:35.193 --> 15:37.628
And I'll give you a hint. He's authentic...

15:38.425 --> 15:39.545
And terrific.

15:42.098 --> 15:44.264
So me and burns argued? So what?

15:44.265 --> 15:45.415
It's a free country.

15:45.416 --> 15:48.345
Free speech doesn't cover
death threats, Mr. Sabalini.

15:48.346 --> 15:51.191
Or murder.
I told you, I was home last night.

15:51.192 --> 15:53.833
Yeah, you did, but your wife
tells us a different story.

15:53.834 --> 15:56.805
It seems she remembers you
sneaking out before midnight,

15:56.806 --> 15:58.521
after you thought she was asleep.

15:58.522 --> 15:59.927
She told us you were off to see

15:59.928 --> 16:02.845
"that whore mistress of
his over in flatbush,"

16:02.846 --> 16:04.835
and when she confronted you
about it this morning,

16:04.836 --> 16:06.788
you told her that you went into the city

16:06.789 --> 16:09.568
because the store alarm was going off.

16:09.569 --> 16:12.356
We checked. It wasn't.

16:12.357 --> 16:14.774
So who were you lying to,
Luca, me or your wife?

16:15.913 --> 16:17.081
My wife.

16:17.728 --> 16:20.001
I was with Angie last night.
You can ask her.

16:20.193 --> 16:23.046
I could. But it doesn't
mean I'm gonna believe her.

16:24.348 --> 16:26.075
What were you and burns fighting about?

16:26.560 --> 16:28.381
He was gonna write something about me,

16:28.706 --> 16:30.621
destroy everything I've worked for.

16:30.622 --> 16:32.733
I had to stop him.
And what was he gonna write?

16:33.645 --> 16:35.102
About my pizza.

16:35.484 --> 16:38.093
About what makes my fat-free
pizza taste so good.

16:42.150 --> 16:43.352
It's made with real cheese.

16:43.353 --> 16:45.209
There's nothing fat-free about it.

16:47.394 --> 16:49.881
You were gonna kill for that?
It's an expression.

16:49.882 --> 16:51.643
Besides, burns called me last night.
He said

16:51.644 --> 16:54.274
he'd consider not running
it if I'd do him a favor.

16:54.537 --> 16:55.512
What favor?

16:55.513 --> 16:56.969
Hey, he didn't say what.

16:57.330 --> 16:59.176
He was supposed to stop by
today to talk about it.

16:59.177 --> 17:02.426
You said that he called you yesterday?
From where?

17:02.557 --> 17:04.996
Okay, got it. The incoming call on his cell

17:04.997 --> 17:08.204
was from the hotel beta in midtown.

17:08.204 --> 17:09.613
All right, let's go.

17:18.589 --> 17:19.679
Thanks.

17:19.680 --> 17:23.472
Paid in cash, signed in
under the name Melville.

17:23.473 --> 17:25.728
This guy's definitely
flying under the radar.

17:25.729 --> 17:27.329
Castle, there's his computer.

17:30.410 --> 17:31.628
Okay.

17:31.629 --> 17:34.173
"New York's authentic terrific pizza wars."

17:34.326 --> 17:35.894
Sharp narration,

17:36.429 --> 17:38.125
delicate prose.

17:40.393 --> 17:43.012
It's a puff piece.
Well, I can practically smell the garlic,

17:43.013 --> 17:44.372
but there's nothing in there

17:44.509 --> 17:46.304
that's about anything heavier than pizza.

17:46.305 --> 17:49.676
Or what got him killed.
Mm, his most recent notes.

17:49.677 --> 17:52.112
Pizza, recipes,

17:52.113 --> 17:53.312
inter...

17:53.840 --> 17:54.960
what?

17:55.421 --> 17:56.654
Look at that.

17:57.561 --> 17:58.729
That's last night.

17:59.301 --> 18:00.241
He was meeting with someone.

18:00.242 --> 18:02.831
Someone from that phone number,
just before he was killed.

18:03.093 --> 18:05.568
I'm gonna run that down.
You have an app for that?

18:05.569 --> 18:07.424
Yeah, NYPD issue. We just got it.

18:07.625 --> 18:08.905
Can I... whoa.

18:09.797 --> 18:10.917
Fine.

18:11.241 --> 18:13.033
Then you don't get
to play my "angry birds."

18:13.577 --> 18:15.976
And they just came out with a new one.

18:17.512 --> 18:20.118
"Johnny Farrell, Swede Anderson."

18:21.649 --> 18:23.020
How do I know those names?

18:23.021 --> 18:25.359
I don't know, but recognize this person?

18:26.689 --> 18:28.536
That's the woman from burns' wallet.

18:28.537 --> 18:30.388
Bingo. Monica Wyatt.

18:30.389 --> 18:31.667
And if she met with him last night,

18:31.668 --> 18:33.765
she might be the last person
to have seen him alive.

18:33.837 --> 18:35.534
I wonder if they went out for pizza.

18:44.433 --> 18:46.300
Little upscale for the pizza world.

18:46.301 --> 18:47.789
Unless she's a middle man.

18:48.433 --> 18:50.001
For the money laundering operation?

18:50.449 --> 18:52.172
She transfers the assets out of country

18:52.173 --> 18:54.591
into Swiss bank accounts using the names

18:54.592 --> 18:56.552
Johnny Farrell and Swede Anderson.

18:56.553 --> 18:59.768
Or she's just a real estate agent
as she claims to be.

18:59.769 --> 19:01.772
Oh, that's just her cover
to avoid scrutiny with the feds.

19:01.773 --> 19:02.977
You had a lot of imaginary

19:02.978 --> 19:05.188
friends growing up, didn't you? Still do.

19:06.781 --> 19:08.220
Hi. Can I help you?

19:09.113 --> 19:10.789
I can't believe he still had this.

19:10.790 --> 19:12.822
He actually took this on our first date.

19:13.553 --> 19:15.177
And how long were the two of you together?

19:15.178 --> 19:16.324
Just a couple of months,

19:16.325 --> 19:20.133
but God, this had to be three years ago.

19:22.301 --> 19:24.972
I saw him once or twice after
his daughter's accident.

19:25.173 --> 19:28.970
He was different.
It's like he just drifted away.

19:29.229 --> 19:30.588
What made you see him last night?

19:30.913 --> 19:32.721
I-I didn't see him last night.

19:33.142 --> 19:36.070
Well, according to his notes,
he met up with you at 10:00 P.M.

19:36.822 --> 19:38.839
Well, that wasn't a meeting.
That was a date.

19:39.885 --> 19:41.784
But... he didn't show.

19:42.224 --> 19:43.641
You said you hadn't seen him in years.

19:43.642 --> 19:45.084
How did you end up on a date?

19:45.085 --> 19:47.935
We bumped into each other
in the street the other day.

19:48.302 --> 19:50.032
It was weird because...

19:50.033 --> 19:51.805
It was in the village, and
I never go down there,

19:51.806 --> 19:53.336
and he said he doesn't go
down there either,

19:53.337 --> 19:56.025
but he was working on a story.

19:56.654 --> 19:58.109
Did he tell you what it was about?

19:59.065 --> 20:00.313
No.

20:01.750 --> 20:04.933
How did he seem... uh, worried, distressed?

20:05.116 --> 20:06.621
He seemed like himself,

20:07.872 --> 20:09.169
like his old self,

20:09.361 --> 20:10.897
like he was on to something.

20:11.427 --> 20:12.784
He'd just come from the hall of records,

20:12.785 --> 20:17.106
and whatever he found,
he was really excited about.

20:17.141 --> 20:18.472
The hall of records?

20:18.473 --> 20:19.571
Yeah.

20:19.572 --> 20:21.752
Ms. Wyatt, do the names Johnny Farrell

20:21.753 --> 20:24.171
or Swede Anderson mean anything to you?

20:26.591 --> 20:28.031
I can't say they do.

20:29.245 --> 20:31.852
Monica Wyatt... checks.

20:31.853 --> 20:34.132
Her brokerage house says that she complains

20:34.133 --> 20:36.064
about commissions more than they'd like,

20:36.065 --> 20:38.061
but other than that, she's clean.

20:38.266 --> 20:39.689
You find anything else in there?

20:39.761 --> 20:42.817
Nope. The rest is just pizza. Hey.

20:43.928 --> 20:45.996
I just got through burns' financials.

20:45.997 --> 20:49.465
Any activity last night?
Uh, yeah. Something odd.

20:49.466 --> 20:52.723
15 P.M., he used his ATM card.

20:52.724 --> 20:54.571
Where? A not-so-good neighborhood

20:54.572 --> 20:56.256
about 15 blocks away from authentic Nick's.

20:56.257 --> 20:59.279
But here's the odd part...
he never finished the transaction.

20:59.280 --> 21:00.148
You mean he canceled it.

21:00.149 --> 21:01.907
No, no, he never finished it.

21:02.453 --> 21:03.757
He popped in his ATM card,

21:03.758 --> 21:05.882
but then after about
a minute of inactivity,

21:06.314 --> 21:09.497
it ate his card. It's almost as if...

21:09.498 --> 21:12.848
something happened. Get ATM surveillance.
Let's find out what.

21:12.849 --> 21:15.361
I'm gonna go to the hall
of records tomorrow morning

21:16.029 --> 21:18.204
and see if we can figure out
what burns was up to.

21:22.549 --> 21:23.638
Well...

21:24.877 --> 21:25.697
What happened?

21:25.698 --> 21:29.151
Alexis decided to crash Lauren's party,

21:29.152 --> 21:31.184
against our better judgment...

21:31.185 --> 21:32.326
And I take it that

21:32.327 --> 21:35.384
the, uh, party crashing didn't go so well?

21:35.393 --> 21:37.399
None of this would've
happened if Lauren wasn't

21:37.400 --> 21:40.076
the most conniving bitch
in the entire world. Whoa.

21:40.077 --> 21:42.868
It's warranted.
When the band was performing,

21:42.869 --> 21:44.787
Lauren brought Ashley up on stage with her,

21:44.788 --> 21:47.069
and she kissed him in front of everyone.

21:47.070 --> 21:49.814
Bitch. How could she do
this to me, to Ashley?

21:49.815 --> 21:51.685
What did Ashley do? He was mortified.

21:51.686 --> 21:53.087
He ran off stage, and we left.

21:53.088 --> 21:55.072
I mean, he was apologizing
a thousand times and said

21:55.073 --> 21:57.016
he had no idea that she was gonna do that.

21:57.353 --> 21:59.801
It's like she's been trying
to break us up this whole time.

22:00.145 --> 22:03.104
It's been her master plan.
Well, she didn't succeed, darling.

22:03.105 --> 22:04.556
You and Ashley are stronger than ever,

22:04.557 --> 22:08.492
and... and she looks like a fool.
Yeah, I wish that were true.

22:08.496 --> 22:10.849
But according to the Internet,
Ashley cheated on me.

22:11.049 --> 22:12.600
She already posted
the pictures of them kissing

22:12.601 --> 22:13.913
all over her web site.

22:16.178 --> 22:17.345
It's a nightmare.

22:26.631 --> 22:27.556
Where's Beckett?

22:27.557 --> 22:28.816
Oh, hall of records,

22:28.817 --> 22:31.745
tracking down what burns
was looking for. Great.

22:32.165 --> 22:36.597
Listen... if I gave you a web site,

22:37.053 --> 22:39.160
could you have your friends
at tech hack into it

22:39.161 --> 22:41.129
and take some pictures down?

22:42.662 --> 22:44.169
Did someone find
naked pictures of you again?

22:44.170 --> 22:46.873
No, it's not me. It's Alexis.

22:47.393 --> 22:48.738
It's for Alexis.

22:51.086 --> 22:53.064
Uh, this just got awkward.
What's this about?

22:53.065 --> 22:54.027
Okay.

22:54.896 --> 22:58.124
Mean girl at school
kiss-ambushed Alexis' boyfriend

22:58.125 --> 23:00.717
and then posted the photographic
proof on her web site.

23:00.781 --> 23:03.293
Alexis... very upset. Mm-hmm.

23:03.421 --> 23:05.005
I-I could have my friend Tony

23:05.094 --> 23:08.309
take care of it, you know,
off the record. Thanks.

23:08.465 --> 23:11.147
Mm-hmm. And, uh, no need
to mention this to Beckett.

23:11.148 --> 23:12.919
You know how she gets with these things.

23:12.920 --> 23:13.833
Yeah.

23:15.261 --> 23:17.104
Things like abusing police resources

23:17.105 --> 23:19.527
for your own personal agenda?

23:20.293 --> 23:21.588
What?

23:21.814 --> 23:25.270
That's ridic... no, you don't...
ab... no, that's... that's...

23:25.848 --> 23:28.419
So, uh, what'd you find? Anything on nicks?

23:28.420 --> 23:29.721
Uh, not exactly.

23:29.722 --> 23:32.732
Burns requested files
relating to the 2003 murder

23:32.733 --> 23:35.109
of a drug trafficker named Harley Romero,

23:35.110 --> 23:38.583
a.K.A. Harley playful,
also known as handsome Harley.

23:38.584 --> 23:41.065
Judging from those photos,
I'm guessing it was ironic.

23:41.066 --> 23:42.483
What's a guy who's been
dead for eight years

23:42.484 --> 23:45.148
have to do with pizza? Mm. Hey, Ryan.

23:45.149 --> 23:47.374
Yep. Did you get a chance
to look into all the nicks

23:47.375 --> 23:48.511
and their employees? Oh, yeah,

23:48.512 --> 23:50.093
just going over the reports right now.

23:50.094 --> 23:52.225
Mostly minor stuff. Any drug charges?

23:52.226 --> 23:55.212
No, nothing about drugs.
Romero? You think maybe

23:55.213 --> 23:57.645
it's some kind of mafia
tie-in with authentic Nick's?

23:57.646 --> 23:58.992
According to the file,
there's no connection

23:58.993 --> 24:00.641
to any of the families.
Someone didn't like him.

24:00.642 --> 24:02.733
It says here he was shot a dozen times,

24:02.871 --> 24:05.056
dumped in an oil drum, and set on fire.

24:05.057 --> 24:06.883
Yeah, word on the street was
that a dealer killed him

24:06.884 --> 24:10.325
over a turf war.
So why was burns looking at him?

24:11.033 --> 24:13.627
Yo. Bank just sent over
surveillance footage.

24:13.628 --> 24:14.909
You guys gotta see this.

24:19.174 --> 24:20.649
Looks like he's running from something.

24:20.650 --> 24:22.809
He's running from something all right.
Watch this.

24:24.722 --> 24:27.239
He knows he's on camera.
He's trying to tell us something.

24:27.240 --> 24:28.441
He's writing it.

24:30.196 --> 24:32.148
Whoa! Okay, take it back.

24:38.337 --> 24:39.584
And freeze there.

24:40.109 --> 24:41.182
He's got a knife.

24:41.473 --> 24:42.704
He was trying to send us a message,

24:42.705 --> 24:45.201
but he recorded his own murder.
Close up on the face.

24:49.051 --> 24:50.697
Castle, look at that face.

24:52.038 --> 24:53.413
That's Harley Romero.

24:53.658 --> 24:56.261
And he is very much alive.

25:05.274 --> 25:06.468
Why would he stop to write a message?

25:06.469 --> 25:07.639
Why not just keep running? Well,

25:07.640 --> 25:09.871
that street empties on to a blind alley.

25:09.872 --> 25:11.284
Maybe burns thought he couldn't get away.

25:11.285 --> 25:12.299
Any idea what he was writing there?

25:12.300 --> 25:13.857
We're seeing if tech can enhance the image,

25:13.858 --> 25:16.386
but we found no connection
between this Harley

25:16.426 --> 25:18.748
and the pizza joints.
Maybe pizza has nothing to do with it.

25:18.749 --> 25:20.877
Maybe burns knew Harley from an old story.

25:20.984 --> 25:24.269
No. I-I don't recognize him at all.

25:24.405 --> 25:26.972
Did burns ever mention the name Harley

25:26.973 --> 25:28.148
in any of his stories?

25:28.149 --> 25:31.094
Never. When this guy supposedly died,

25:31.417 --> 25:33.397
Gordon was embedded
with the 2nd marine division

25:33.398 --> 25:34.485
in Gulf ii.

25:34.486 --> 25:36.586
Mr. Shaw, do the names Johnny Farrell

25:36.587 --> 25:38.605
or Swede Anderson mean anything to you?

25:38.872 --> 25:40.527
Yeah. They do.

25:40.528 --> 25:43.553
They're both characters
from old film noir movies. Right.

25:43.561 --> 25:46.336
Uh, Johnny Farrell from the movie "Gilda,"

25:46.337 --> 25:48.609
Glenn Ford's character,
and Burt Lancaster played

25:48.610 --> 25:50.168
Swede Anderson in "the killers."

25:50.169 --> 25:51.828
And why would these two names be important?

25:51.829 --> 25:53.845
This guy... Harley... what kind
of drugs was he dealing?

25:53.846 --> 25:55.572
Heroin, why?

25:56.231 --> 25:58.425
Because the only heroin story
burns ever chased

25:58.426 --> 26:00.201
was the one that he could never finish,

26:00.449 --> 26:02.328
about a high-end distribution
ring in New York

26:02.329 --> 26:05.128
that sets up shop inside
legitimate businesses.

26:05.166 --> 26:08.013
When someone needed product,
they'd use a code word.

26:08.456 --> 26:11.752
Their code happens to be names
of characters from film noir.

26:13.218 --> 26:14.945
It's that story that destroyed him.

26:15.002 --> 26:18.025
Why? Because of the guy
who was behind the ring.

26:18.829 --> 26:20.076
It was Cavallo.

26:20.141 --> 26:22.944
Gordon burns was gunning for
the prince of darkness himself.

26:22.945 --> 26:24.272
Who's Cavallo?

26:24.287 --> 26:28.250
It's a-a street myth, an urban legend.

26:28.261 --> 26:31.532
Anytime a dealer gets whacked,
people always say it's Cavallo,

26:31.533 --> 26:34.824
but he's not even real. Oh, Cavallo's real.

26:34.825 --> 26:36.888
Come on, Shaw.
We've all heard the scary stories.

26:36.889 --> 26:38.919
I didn't. So the story goes

26:38.920 --> 26:40.684
that Cavallo was mentored

26:40.685 --> 26:43.656
by this badass Colombian drug lord...

26:43.657 --> 26:44.924
Khazi "The Conqueror"...

26:44.925 --> 26:47.508
and eventually he put
a bullet to his boss' head,

26:47.509 --> 26:51.283
slit all of his kids' throats,
and took over the operation.

26:51.284 --> 26:53.317
But I mean, it's a fairy tale.

26:53.429 --> 26:55.958
Not to burns. Not to his daughter.

26:56.818 --> 26:58.143
Burns told me he had a contact

26:58.144 --> 27:00.032
that was getting him close to Cavallo.

27:00.120 --> 27:01.092
The next day, he and his daughter

27:01.093 --> 27:04.181
are crossing the street,
this car appears out of nowhere.

27:04.844 --> 27:06.768
When he came to, his leg was shattered.

27:06.769 --> 27:08.908
Nina was 20 feet away, bleeding out,

27:08.909 --> 27:10.460
and he couldn't even
crawl over to hold her,

27:10.461 --> 27:12.781
so don't you tell me Cavallo isn't real.

27:14.515 --> 27:18.009
It sounds like burns was Ahab
and Cavallo, his white whale.

27:18.010 --> 27:20.554
Well, he did sign in to
the hotel as Melville.

27:20.793 --> 27:23.864
You know, it's that kind of
sly humor that burns was known for.

27:24.213 --> 27:26.464
And while I am loathe to profile,

27:26.465 --> 27:28.679
the name Cavallo... also the
Italian word for "horse"...

27:28.680 --> 27:30.873
might suggest a link back to the nicks.

27:31.153 --> 27:33.691
Hey, Ryan. When you were in narcotics,

27:33.692 --> 27:35.693
when was the first time
you heard the name Cavallo?

27:35.694 --> 27:37.713
I don't know. Probably around, uh, '03.

27:37.714 --> 27:39.552
Around all that time all those
dealers were getting whacked.

27:39.553 --> 27:41.218
Well, that's right when Harley was killed.

27:41.378 --> 27:43.449
So Harley stages his own death,

27:43.450 --> 27:45.113
brutally murders his competition,

27:45.392 --> 27:47.476
and then starts a whisper
campaign on the streets

27:47.477 --> 27:49.256
about the new dark prince of heroin...

27:49.257 --> 27:51.385
And a legend is born. Yo.

27:52.356 --> 27:54.559
Tech was able to blow up and
enhance that ATM video.

27:54.560 --> 27:55.909
They're sending it up now.

27:58.718 --> 28:00.510
I still can't make it out. Mnh-mnh.

28:00.643 --> 28:01.609
Run it again.

28:01.648 --> 28:03.904
Can you flip it and slow it down?

28:03.905 --> 28:05.956
Yeah. What are you doing?

28:06.137 --> 28:09.093
What I do best... writing.

28:09.187 --> 28:10.802
Okay, 3...

28:11.782 --> 28:13.124
6... s...

28:13.125 --> 28:15.950
That could be a 5. Okay, s or a 5...

28:16.342 --> 28:19.507
W-1-2... 7?

28:19.508 --> 28:20.644
It's an address.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.320
B... a... s?

28:23.321 --> 28:24.051
Basement.

28:24.052 --> 28:27.401
365 west 127th street, in the basement.

28:27.402 --> 28:29.310
That's three blocks from the ATM.

28:29.995 --> 28:31.922
Police! Nobody move!

28:31.923 --> 28:33.223
NYPD!

28:34.888 --> 28:37.434
Room's clear.
Somebody moved out in a hurry.

28:37.797 --> 28:40.458
Coffee grinders for cutting.
Envelopes for packaging.

28:40.459 --> 28:41.892
All the earmarks of a well-organized

28:41.893 --> 28:45.130
heroin processing house.
Get c.S.U. in here. Sweep the area.

28:45.131 --> 28:48.232
If anyone saw anything, I want to know.

28:48.233 --> 28:51.291
Looks like your Ahab found his white whale.

28:51.591 --> 28:52.968
And it took him under.

28:55.384 --> 28:56.875
Hi, dad. Bye, dad.

28:56.876 --> 28:58.075
What, no kiss?

29:03.692 --> 29:04.933
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

29:04.934 --> 29:07.302
Alexis, what happened to your face?
Nothing.

29:07.303 --> 29:08.920
That's not nothing. What happened?

29:09.139 --> 29:12.153
Lauren. She cornered me
in the bathrooms at school,

29:12.154 --> 29:14.175
said I ruined her party,

29:14.176 --> 29:16.351
and then she accused me of
hacking into her account

29:16.352 --> 29:17.857
and deleting those pictures she took,

29:17.858 --> 29:20.239
as if. And... and then what happened?

29:20.240 --> 29:21.578
Well, I called her a backstabber,

29:21.579 --> 29:24.590
and then she scratched me, so I...

29:26.081 --> 29:29.019
You what? I punched her.

29:30.181 --> 29:31.573
Ah. What were you thinking?

29:31.574 --> 29:32.939
I don't know. This isn't me.

29:32.940 --> 29:35.624
I don't crash parties.
I don't get in fights with people.

29:35.625 --> 29:38.473
I... but, dad, she made me so angry.

29:38.474 --> 29:42.325
I know she did, but retaliation
is not the answer.

29:42.326 --> 29:44.122
You get her back, she gets you back,

29:44.123 --> 29:46.604
and then one day, one of you
ends up dead in a pizza oven.

29:46.605 --> 29:49.143
Is that what you want? Look, the point is,

29:49.144 --> 29:52.008
you're gonna have to deal
with mean, backstabbing girls

29:52.009 --> 29:52.709
your whole life.

29:52.710 --> 29:57.075
You need to learn to be
smart enough to rise above.

29:57.862 --> 29:58.810
Okay?

29:59.414 --> 30:00.334
Okay.

30:01.127 --> 30:02.071
Come here.

30:05.289 --> 30:06.473
Did you kick her ass?

30:07.004 --> 30:08.109
I kinda did.

30:08.110 --> 30:09.239
Good girl.

30:10.640 --> 30:13.249
I should've gotten involved much earlier.

30:13.250 --> 30:15.038
Why? Lauren would've still found a way

30:15.039 --> 30:16.875
to make Alexis' life miserable.

30:16.876 --> 30:18.089
Lauren isn't a criminal mastermind.

30:18.090 --> 30:19.766
She's just a teenager. Ah, Castle,

30:19.767 --> 30:22.398
never underestimate the power
of a woman on a mission.

30:22.399 --> 30:25.389
No, I don't. And I have
the alimony checks to prove it.

30:25.390 --> 30:27.343
Beckett, just hung up with the lab.

30:27.457 --> 30:29.568
That trace heroin
from the processing house?

30:29.569 --> 30:32.107
It matches most of the dope being
peddled on the lower east.

30:32.108 --> 30:33.300
Any word on this Harley? Sir,

30:33.301 --> 30:35.058
if half of the rumors
about this guy are true,

30:35.059 --> 30:36.892
then he's got snitches all over the force,

30:36.893 --> 30:39.618
so I was thinking of holding off
on an a.P.B. Until we knew more.

30:39.619 --> 30:41.238
Keep me posted. Yes, sir.

30:42.131 --> 30:43.552
You know, Shaw said that Cavallo

30:43.553 --> 30:46.577
is using legitimate businesses
to distribute product.

30:46.578 --> 30:48.592
You think he could be operating
out of one of the nicks'?

30:48.593 --> 30:51.801
Yeah, but I can't get a warrant
for a fishing expedition.

30:51.802 --> 30:54.562
We're gonna have to have
something more concrete. Yo.

30:54.563 --> 30:57.153
C.S.U. Swept the tenement
basement top to bottom,

30:57.154 --> 30:58.210
there's not one print anywhere.

30:58.211 --> 31:00.841
Any witnesses see burns getting chased?

31:00.842 --> 31:03.155
In that neighborhood, nobody sees nothing.

31:03.156 --> 31:05.247
But one of our uniforms

31:05.248 --> 31:08.789
did find this in a storm
drain near the ATM.

31:08.790 --> 31:12.092
Burns' phone?
Does it strike anyone else as strange

31:12.093 --> 31:14.176
that a seasoned war correspondent

31:14.177 --> 31:15.899
would suddenly develop butterfingers,

31:15.900 --> 31:17.062
drop his phone while being chased?

31:17.063 --> 31:18.339
You think he purposefully dropped it?

31:18.340 --> 31:19.344
So that whoever was chasing

31:19.345 --> 31:22.119
him wouldn't get his phone?
Or what was on it.

31:22.642 --> 31:24.845
The last call he made was 9-1-1

31:25.116 --> 31:26.683
and he didn't press send.

31:31.950 --> 31:33.473
Outside the drug lab.

31:33.634 --> 31:35.129
He was casing the joint.

31:37.901 --> 31:41.633
That's Monica. She's involved.

31:49.269 --> 31:51.991
Monica Wyatt, NYPD! Open up!

31:54.608 --> 31:55.613
Aah! Monica!

31:55.999 --> 31:56.978
Step back.

31:57.189 --> 31:58.287
NYPD!

32:00.818 --> 32:01.830
Monica.

32:02.417 --> 32:04.351
He... he tried to kill me.

32:04.680 --> 32:05.428
Window.

32:05.429 --> 32:06.343
Let's go.

32:08.485 --> 32:11.278
Monica, who did this to you?
If I tell you, then I'm dead.

32:11.279 --> 32:13.279
I think we're past that. Who did it?

32:14.751 --> 32:15.927
Cavallo.

32:23.703 --> 32:25.767
I wasn't lying before about Gordon.

32:25.873 --> 32:27.988
We did date years ago, and
I thought it was real,

32:27.989 --> 32:31.296
but he was just doing it
to get close to Cavallo.

32:31.297 --> 32:32.961
I never imagined that...

32:33.602 --> 32:35.404
What's a midtown real estate agent

32:35.405 --> 32:37.545
doing mixed up with heroin dealers?

32:38.259 --> 32:39.764
Their labs are mobile.

32:39.830 --> 32:40.655
They need new places

32:40.656 --> 32:42.973
for their processing centers
every month or so, and I had

32:42.974 --> 32:44.983
access to all the information
that they needed.

32:44.984 --> 32:48.133
Look... this is not who I am.

32:48.595 --> 32:51.770
I mean, I never meant for anything...
how did it start?

32:53.628 --> 32:55.221
I had some problems

32:55.501 --> 32:56.979
a few years back.

32:57.501 --> 32:59.190
I owed some people money.

32:59.366 --> 33:01.518
A man came to me

33:01.519 --> 33:04.022
and he told me that
he could make it all better.

33:05.042 --> 33:08.392
I just... had to do a favor
for him every now and then.

33:08.393 --> 33:12.241
And at the time, that
actually sounded harmless.

33:13.022 --> 33:16.265
But this man knew things about me.

33:16.372 --> 33:18.828
I mean things that nobody
could possibly know.

33:18.862 --> 33:19.908
And I wanted to leave,

33:19.909 --> 33:23.894
but... after what happened
to Gordon's kid, I just...

33:25.135 --> 33:26.464
Gordon found me a couple of days ago.

33:26.465 --> 33:28.144
He said he needed my help.

33:28.626 --> 33:31.591
He said that I could end this,
and that we both could be free.

33:31.974 --> 33:34.098
All I had to do was take him there.

33:34.972 --> 33:36.518
And now Gordon is dead,

33:37.118 --> 33:38.570
and I am next.

33:40.892 --> 33:42.726
Cavallo... who is he?

33:42.791 --> 33:45.161
I've never seen him.
Didn't he just try to kill you?

33:45.162 --> 33:46.394
If I knew who Cavallo was,

33:46.395 --> 33:48.074
don't you think I would've told Gordon?

33:48.075 --> 33:50.242
I've only ever dealt with
Cavallo's right-hand man before.

33:50.243 --> 33:53.242
That's who was here trying to kill me.
And who is this man?

33:56.177 --> 33:57.598
His name is Harley.

34:01.258 --> 34:02.188
Him?

34:05.016 --> 34:06.982
Harley is Cavallo.

34:07.911 --> 34:10.353
So Cavallo is hiding right
under everyone's noses.

34:10.355 --> 34:12.458
How do I find him? He finds me.

34:13.422 --> 34:15.188
Monica, Gordon was right.

34:15.385 --> 34:18.572
We can end this, but we need your help.

34:18.572 --> 34:20.922
We believe that Cavallo
is trafficking drugs

34:20.922 --> 34:23.652
through a pizzeria, but we
need to know which one.

34:24.737 --> 34:26.504
I'm sorry. I don't know which one.

34:27.382 --> 34:29.952
Yo. We covered the whole area.

34:29.953 --> 34:31.617
Whoever he was, he's in the wind.

34:32.135 --> 34:33.936
All right. Why don't you guys
take Monica to the E.R.?

34:33.937 --> 34:36.583
Get her checked, and then
get her over to narcotics.

34:36.585 --> 34:39.333
Let them talk to her. One last question...

34:41.212 --> 34:43.742
Johnny Farrell and Swede Anderson?

34:44.572 --> 34:46.987
That's how Gordon got on
to this story in the first place.

34:47.914 --> 34:49.572
He heard somebody at one
of the pizza joints

34:49.574 --> 34:52.376
using those names, and
he knew it was Cavallo's code.

34:54.451 --> 34:57.408
Those were last week's names.
Do you know this week's names?

34:57.990 --> 35:00.500
No, but Gordon said they were
from his favorite film...

35:00.645 --> 35:01.971
"the Maltese falcon."

35:04.240 --> 35:06.405
You're a sneak. What? I'm a what?

35:07.872 --> 35:09.932
I don't care if these guys
could've recognized you.

35:09.933 --> 35:10.627
You hold 'em much longer,

35:10.628 --> 35:12.426
there's gonna be another
murder on our hands.

35:12.427 --> 35:13.836
Relax. We're almost done.

35:13.837 --> 35:15.762
We got two nicks down, two to go.

35:15.763 --> 35:17.896
Okay. Call you in a bit.
I wonder if I should've used

35:17.897 --> 35:20.289
Sydney Greenstreet's character...
Kasper Gutman.

35:20.290 --> 35:22.293
Now there's a guy who loved his pizza.

35:22.294 --> 35:23.948
Well, we already put
our money down on Bogie,

35:23.949 --> 35:25.728
so let's just play this through.

35:27.331 --> 35:28.290
Slice?

35:28.650 --> 35:31.456
Uh, no, a pickup actually for spade...

35:31.483 --> 35:32.579
Sam spade.

35:34.314 --> 35:35.586
Of course, Mr. spade.

35:35.588 --> 35:36.851
We have your order right here.

35:43.111 --> 35:44.694
Here you go, Mr. spade.

35:44.723 --> 35:46.018
We put it on your tab.

35:47.101 --> 35:48.086
Thank you.

35:52.318 --> 35:55.005
Winner, winner, pizza dinner.

36:02.863 --> 36:04.798
Possession, trafficking,

36:04.799 --> 36:06.758
conspiracy to distribute...
that right there

36:06.759 --> 36:08.846
is 30 years, easy, Sal...

36:08.847 --> 36:11.475
30 terrific authentic years.

36:11.476 --> 36:13.690
It's life if you're
an accessory to Burns' murder.

36:13.691 --> 36:15.275
No, I had nothing to do with that. I swear.

36:15.276 --> 36:17.098
You swear?
So what are you trying to tell me?

36:17.099 --> 36:20.082
Are you trying to tell me
that Harley had the idea

36:20.083 --> 36:23.121
to put the body in your rival's oven?
You're a pizza man, Sal.

36:23.122 --> 36:25.608
Body in an oven sounds
more like you're speed.

36:25.609 --> 36:28.519
No. No, no, no, it was him. It was all him.

36:28.520 --> 36:29.937
So what, now you're a victim?

36:29.938 --> 36:32.991
Look, my place was struggling.

36:32.992 --> 36:35.139
He came to me, he said the man
that he worked for could help.

36:35.140 --> 36:38.785
All I had to do was let him use
my shop for a couple of months,

36:38.815 --> 36:40.143
then he would make...

36:40.878 --> 36:42.186
My dream come true.

36:42.695 --> 36:43.655
Your dream?

36:43.867 --> 36:46.451
Yeah, he said, uh, after it was over,

36:47.840 --> 36:49.777
the man he worked for would, uh...

36:50.630 --> 36:53.151
B-burn down authentic Nick's.

36:54.145 --> 36:55.312
This ain't me.

36:56.229 --> 36:58.067
I never even smoked a joint.

36:58.068 --> 36:59.958
But all those other nicks,
the stuff they were doing,

36:59.959 --> 37:03.233
it was driving me crazy.
How did Burns' body get in the oven?

37:04.033 --> 37:05.692
Harley called me that night,

37:05.720 --> 37:08.958
said he needed to throw
something in my oven overnight.

37:09.449 --> 37:10.719
He didn't say what it was.

37:10.720 --> 37:11.309
Yeah, but you knew it

37:11.310 --> 37:13.918
wasn't a tray of lasagna.
And I said no way.

37:14.029 --> 37:17.419
No way. I never signed up
for cremation services.

37:17.933 --> 37:20.610
I never dreamed what I turned away

37:20.611 --> 37:22.808
would end up in Ralph Carbone's oven.

37:27.674 --> 37:28.977
You want our help, Sal?

37:29.122 --> 37:32.821
You want me to put in
a good word with the d.A.? Yeah.

37:33.241 --> 37:34.754
Then help me find him.

37:34.768 --> 37:36.320
Help me find Cavallo.

37:38.785 --> 37:40.210
You can't find him.

37:40.613 --> 37:41.648
He finds you.

37:41.649 --> 37:44.621
That's not helping me, Sal.
You don't get it.

37:44.883 --> 37:47.453
When I run out of product, I call him.

37:48.502 --> 37:49.749
He delivers.

37:52.562 --> 37:53.748
Make the call.

38:09.600 --> 38:13.287
Harley Romero, a.K.A.,
the legendary Cavallo.

38:13.288 --> 38:15.184
He won't talk without a lawyer.

38:15.185 --> 38:16.754
With the evidence from the ATM video

38:16.755 --> 38:18.546
and Sal's testimony, he's gonna need one.

38:18.547 --> 38:20.945
You know, it's brilliant
when you think about it.

38:21.024 --> 38:23.325
***

38:23.326 --> 38:24.547
*** everyone stays busy

38:24.548 --> 38:26.553
looking for the menacing mythic overlord...

38:26.554 --> 38:29.450
Who no one ever meets
because he's not really real.

38:29.451 --> 38:30.269
Well, real or not,

38:30.270 --> 38:33.491
he's going away for a long time. Good work.

38:37.538 --> 38:39.548
Narcotics is finished with Monica Wyatt.

38:39.549 --> 38:41.943
She cooperated fully.
Okay, process her out.

38:41.944 --> 38:43.085
And put a patrol car outside her building

38:43.086 --> 38:45.818
for the next few nights,
just in case Cavallo has friends.

38:48.230 --> 38:49.172
What's up?

38:50.205 --> 38:52.501
I was just thinking about Burns,
how close he came to catching

38:52.502 --> 38:54.707
the guy who killed his daughter
only to come up shit.***

38:54.708 --> 38:57.737
Well, if it's your consolation,
there's *** justice now.

38:58.539 --> 39:00.428
Ahah you know what' still ruining ? Hmm?

39:00.918 --> 39:02.985
*** is ruining for his life,

39:03.154 --> 39:04.476
why does *** his one?

39:04.477 --> 39:06.232
Well he probably knew
that he was gonna get led,

39:06.233 --> 39:09.146
and he wanted at least someone
to know the truth. What truth?

39:09.248 --> 39:09.912
It wasn't like there was a

39:09.913 --> 39:11.606
picture of Cavallo on it. No, you're right.

39:11.607 --> 39:15.517
The only person he had a picture of was...

39:25.460 --> 39:27.362
Just a few more questions, Ms. Wyatt.

39:30.260 --> 39:32.336
I have been waiting over an hour.

39:33.234 --> 39:36.224
You know the funny thing
about this case is that

39:36.315 --> 39:38.675
nobody is who they claim
to be, not even you.

39:38.676 --> 39:40.324
Monica Wyatt... it says here

39:40.325 --> 39:42.895
you moved to New York in 2002 from L.A.

39:43.209 --> 39:44.406
Yeah, so?

39:44.407 --> 39:46.753
So we did a little bit of digging,

39:46.998 --> 39:49.536
and the only Monica Wyatt that we found

39:49.537 --> 39:53.153
was a heroin addict who
was shot point-blank

39:53.154 --> 39:55.153
and then dumped in the L.A. river.

39:55.154 --> 39:56.483
Six months later,

39:56.877 --> 40:00.349
word of a new and brutal kingpin
started sweeping the streets.

40:00.355 --> 40:01.968
And you're saying that's me?

40:03.983 --> 40:06.261
I'm a real estate agent.
Have you seen my apartment?

40:06.262 --> 40:07.601
Oh, yeah, we saw that one.

40:07.947 --> 40:12.578
But all of the other ones can
only be previewed online.

40:12.828 --> 40:13.981
What are you talking about?

40:13.982 --> 40:16.781
Your apartment sales
to Walter Neff, Frank chambers,

40:16.782 --> 40:20.043
Richard Harland... they're all
characters from noir films.

40:20.044 --> 40:21.291
They aren't real.

40:21.292 --> 40:24.105
You made millions in heroin holdings,

40:24.106 --> 40:27.193
which you turned into millions
in real estate holdings,

40:27.194 --> 40:28.182
all clean.

40:29.186 --> 40:30.047
All the while,

40:30.313 --> 40:32.002
perpetuating the myth of Cavallo.

40:32.003 --> 40:34.076
Gordon didn't die chasing a myth.

40:34.077 --> 40:35.084
Oh, yeah, Gordon.

40:35.085 --> 40:37.503
Well, there's something
that you didn't completely lie about.

40:37.504 --> 40:39.486
You did meet him a couple of years ago,

40:39.487 --> 40:41.013
but not as a boyfriend.

40:42.022 --> 40:43.230
He was a pain-in-the-ass reporter

40:43.231 --> 40:45.320
that just kept getting a little too close.

40:45.321 --> 40:47.375
Until a car came out of nowhere

40:47.759 --> 40:49.115
and killed his daughter.

40:49.485 --> 40:51.440
That got him out of
your hair for a couple of years,

40:51.441 --> 40:54.742
but then he caught your scent
again at Nick's pizza.

40:54.900 --> 40:57.429
And that forced you
to get rid of him permanently.

40:58.032 --> 41:00.918
And then you fed us Harley,
the sacrificial lamb,

41:01.048 --> 41:02.218
to throw us off your trail.

41:02.219 --> 41:03.429
Harley attacked me.

41:03.430 --> 41:06.101
Oh, yeah, and then he managed
to run down the fire escape

41:06.102 --> 41:08.816
with such incredible speed

41:08.817 --> 41:10.973
that two of New York's finest detectives

41:10.974 --> 41:14.931
were incapable of seeing him,
never mind catching him.

41:14.932 --> 41:16.404
Beating yourself up...

41:16.981 --> 41:18.106
Was a nice touch.

41:19.765 --> 41:21.272
You know what I just realized?

41:21.273 --> 41:24.231
All those noir films that
Cavallo draws his names from,

41:24.232 --> 41:26.064
they all have one thing in common...

41:27.822 --> 41:29.066
a femme fatale.

41:32.215 --> 41:33.868
I'd like my lawyer now.

41:41.346 --> 41:42.860
Ah, great.

41:43.675 --> 41:44.741
You're still up.

41:44.903 --> 41:46.423
Couldn't sleep if I wanted to.

41:46.424 --> 41:47.775
That makes two of us.

41:48.466 --> 41:50.884
Is that from Stefano's? Mm-hmm.

41:51.149 --> 41:53.174
You went all the way across
the bridge for a pizza?

41:53.175 --> 41:55.001
Not for just anyone.

41:55.441 --> 41:57.772
Fresh basil and sausage.

41:58.787 --> 42:00.095
Any updates on, uh...

42:00.096 --> 42:01.555
Uh, um...

42:01.752 --> 42:03.795
I called a mediation session

42:03.796 --> 42:05.849
with our school counselor today.

42:06.213 --> 42:08.444
And it turns out, Lauren was just jealous

42:08.445 --> 42:10.374
of all the time I was spending with Ashley.

42:10.375 --> 42:14.160
She thought I had ditched our friendship.
So what'd you do?

42:14.161 --> 42:15.925
We hugged it out.

42:17.311 --> 42:18.595
And now you're friends again?

42:18.715 --> 42:20.586
It's too soon to tell.

42:21.538 --> 42:23.006
Hurts like these...

42:24.258 --> 42:25.758
Take time to heal.

42:26.211 --> 42:27.230
Time...

42:28.083 --> 42:29.069
And pizza.

42:31.676 --> 42:33.311
Ohh. Ooh, look at that.

42:35.935 --> 42:36.864
Cheers.
