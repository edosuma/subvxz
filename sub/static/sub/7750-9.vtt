00:00.270 --> 00:01.940
Previously on "Devious maids"...

00:01.950 --> 00:03.630
So you saw a dvd in the safe?

00:03.665 --> 00:05.275
It had Flora's name on it.

00:05.310 --> 00:07.670
That has to be the one.
You've got to get it.

00:07.705 --> 00:10.030
I will marry you if I
can still be a father.

00:10.065 --> 00:11.765
Exactly what are you suggesting?

00:11.800 --> 00:15.020
I want Valentina to
give us one of her eggs.

00:15.055 --> 00:16.219
Where's his suitcase?

00:16.254 --> 00:17.065
What's going on?

00:17.100 --> 00:19.185
- You're going back to rehab.
- What?!

00:19.220 --> 00:21.080
I didn't know you and
Mr. Powell had a son.

00:21.115 --> 00:23.835
We don't anymore. He was killed.

00:23.870 --> 00:25.840
It's been a long time since
I've enjoyed the company

00:25.875 --> 00:27.405
of such an adorable child.

00:27.440 --> 00:29.870
Brought back a lot
of wonderful memories.

00:30.050 --> 00:32.770
I saw the cytoxan in
your medicine cabinet.

00:32.900 --> 00:34.440
That's what the
doctors gave my mother.

00:34.475 --> 00:35.730
She had cancer?

00:35.940 --> 00:37.690
- Have you told Alejandro?
- No.

00:38.040 --> 00:39.390
Nobody knows.

00:43.900 --> 00:45.605
All the suits have
listened to the new CD.

00:45.640 --> 00:47.720
You know what word they're
starting to toss around?

00:47.950 --> 00:49.050
"Genius."

00:49.860 --> 00:51.115
Well, that's nice,

00:51.150 --> 00:52.980
but I don't think it's ready yet.

00:53.420 --> 00:54.900
The gazpacho is ready.

00:55.100 --> 00:56.410
Uh, we'll be right there.

00:58.750 --> 00:59.750
Odessa,

01:00.140 --> 01:02.070
who's that guy having
lunch with Alejandro?

01:02.105 --> 01:04.349
His agent, Jackson Narino.

01:04.440 --> 01:06.790
He's slimy, but very important.

01:06.910 --> 01:08.350
Did you finish the salad?

01:08.430 --> 01:10.280
Two hours ago. It's in the fridge.

01:10.315 --> 01:11.300
Good.

01:13.180 --> 01:14.390
You look awful.

01:14.720 --> 01:16.360
And you dress like a tramp.

01:16.730 --> 01:18.820
Isn't it nice we can be
honest with each other?

01:18.830 --> 01:21.850
Seriously, I'm worried about you.

01:21.950 --> 01:23.610
Has the chemo been terrible?

01:23.720 --> 01:25.490
Well, it's not for sissies.

01:26.120 --> 01:27.740
When are you gonna tell
Alejandro you're sick?

01:27.775 --> 01:29.370
- I can't.
- Why not?

01:29.380 --> 01:31.070
He would be devastated.

01:31.660 --> 01:33.890
Besides, he has so much
on his mind right now.

01:34.080 --> 01:34.515
Odessa.

01:34.550 --> 01:35.860
I am not telling him!

01:35.870 --> 01:37.520
And I'm sorry I told you.

01:41.020 --> 01:42.285
I didn't mean that.

01:42.320 --> 01:43.550
I'm just tired.

01:45.650 --> 01:46.730
It's fine.

01:49.240 --> 01:50.335
Oh, my god.

01:50.370 --> 01:51.230
- Odessa.
- Yes?

01:51.265 --> 01:52.270
Your hair!

01:52.480 --> 01:53.275
What about it?

01:53.310 --> 01:55.100
- It's falling out.
- What?!

01:55.135 --> 01:56.240
Oh, my god!

01:56.340 --> 01:57.640
It must be the chemo.

01:57.890 --> 01:59.185
Oh, my god!

01:59.220 --> 02:00.680
Odessa, it's everywhere.

02:00.715 --> 02:02.140
Look, it's on the cake...

02:02.175 --> 02:03.152
And the sandwiches!

02:03.187 --> 02:04.130
How did I not see this?

02:04.165 --> 02:05.400
I don't know!

02:07.150 --> 02:08.235
- The soup!
- The soup!

02:08.270 --> 02:09.639
The whole time I
was listening to it,

02:09.675 --> 02:11.005
I was thinking... "Grammy."

02:11.039 --> 02:12.810
- I think you're being very polite.
- No.

02:15.000 --> 02:17.190
- What the...
- It's time for the salad.

02:17.225 --> 02:18.820
But we haven't tasted the soup yet.

02:18.855 --> 02:20.250
You had your chance.

02:22.650 --> 02:24.080
She's Russian.

02:26.000 --> 02:32.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:45.680 --> 02:46.620
Come in!

02:49.940 --> 02:51.140
Did you talk to him?

02:51.280 --> 02:52.340
Yes.

02:54.890 --> 02:56.530
He's agreed to a settlement.

02:57.230 --> 02:57.705
Really?

02:57.740 --> 03:01.030
Only in exchange for a graceful end

03:01.230 --> 03:02.540
to the situation.

03:02.950 --> 03:03.885
What does that mean?

03:03.920 --> 03:05.650
It means if you
keep your mouth shut,

03:06.290 --> 03:07.590
you get this check.

03:11.510 --> 03:12.800
Are you kidding me?

03:12.850 --> 03:14.065
That's very generous.

03:14.100 --> 03:16.430
This is nothing.
Your client raped me.

03:16.465 --> 03:18.030
But how is that possible?

03:18.650 --> 03:19.405
You're a prostitute.

03:19.440 --> 03:21.460
You were paid to have sex with him.

03:21.560 --> 03:23.425
As soon as I found out who he was,

03:23.460 --> 03:25.290
I told him to stop. He didn't.

03:25.325 --> 03:26.515
That's called rape.

03:26.550 --> 03:28.070
And that gets me a
hell of a lot more

03:28.105 --> 03:29.860
than this lousy check.

03:31.980 --> 03:33.405
I'm not sure what
happened that night.

03:33.440 --> 03:34.795
All I know is you don't have proof.

03:34.830 --> 03:36.820
Without that, we don't
back up the money truck

03:36.855 --> 03:38.120
to your doorstep.

03:38.970 --> 03:41.910
Okay. What do I get for a baby?

03:43.540 --> 03:44.500
What?

03:45.530 --> 03:46.660
That's right.

03:46.870 --> 03:48.260
I'm pregnant.

03:49.240 --> 03:52.520
Are you saying that my
client is the father?

03:52.640 --> 03:55.810
No, but he knows who is.

03:56.130 --> 03:58.260
And they are very close.

03:59.750 --> 04:00.835
Oh, god.

04:00.870 --> 04:04.250
Now I have bills to pay,
and a grandmother to support.

04:04.285 --> 04:06.357
So I need a check immediately.

04:06.392 --> 04:08.285
And when I deposit this thing,

04:08.320 --> 04:11.370
I want to see the bank teller gasp.

04:12.730 --> 04:13.810
You got it?

04:14.920 --> 04:17.010
You have no idea who
you're screwing with.

04:17.890 --> 04:20.779
I've seen this guy in
action. He is beyond vicious.

04:21.410 --> 04:23.530
And if you back him into a corner,

04:25.220 --> 04:27.170
there's no telling
what he might do.

04:32.310 --> 04:33.710
I'm not worried.

04:42.230 --> 04:44.355
This is the DVD Rosie found?

04:44.390 --> 04:46.480
Adrian kept it in his safe.

04:46.530 --> 04:49.650
I don't see why. It's
a whole lot of nothing.

04:50.410 --> 04:52.065
Well, I don't think so.

04:52.100 --> 04:55.300
It proves that Michael
Stappord knows who raped Flora.

04:55.335 --> 04:56.970
He was representing the guy.

04:57.005 --> 04:58.585
At $600 an hour,

04:58.620 --> 05:00.920
you can bet he's taking
that name to the grave.

05:00.955 --> 05:02.005
Can't the judge make him tell?

05:02.040 --> 05:04.915
He basically admitted that
his client was violent.

05:04.950 --> 05:08.750
He'll say he was exaggerating
to get Flora to lower her price.

05:09.810 --> 05:10.970
God.

05:14.100 --> 05:15.550
I hate lawyers.

05:15.810 --> 05:17.760
We did learn one useful thing.

05:19.210 --> 05:22.350
The man that raped her is
not the father of her baby.

05:22.450 --> 05:25.390
And there is some kind of
connection between them.

05:25.640 --> 05:27.330
So which one killed her?

05:27.520 --> 05:28.335
My theory was always,

05:28.370 --> 05:30.130
a guy who rapes is
more likely to kill.

05:30.165 --> 05:31.260
I don't know.

05:31.440 --> 05:32.570
There are an awful
lot of guys out there

05:32.580 --> 05:34.490
who don't want to
pay child support.

05:34.860 --> 05:37.220
So... now we just

05:37.230 --> 05:39.780
need to find out
who the father was.

05:39.800 --> 05:42.750
Is there anyone
Flora might have told?

05:42.820 --> 05:44.580
Someone we overlooked?

05:44.615 --> 05:45.950
On the DVD...

05:46.310 --> 05:48.960
didn't she say something
about a grandmother?

05:52.710 --> 05:54.760
It's his birthday!

05:56.000 --> 05:57.890
He turns 1 year old today.

05:57.900 --> 06:00.120
When Mrs. Peri gets back
from New York on Friday,

06:00.155 --> 06:02.670
we're gonna have cake and presents.

06:03.640 --> 06:04.800
Can I come?

06:05.420 --> 06:07.840
Well, it--it's just
me and the family.

06:08.040 --> 06:10.170
Would it be weird for me
to drop in unannounced?

06:10.205 --> 06:12.217
I can tell them
I'm Tucker's friend.

06:12.252 --> 06:14.230
And bring a ridiculously
expensive gift.

06:14.680 --> 06:16.670
Yes, that would be weird.

06:16.890 --> 06:17.870
Which part?

06:18.750 --> 06:19.920
All of it.

06:20.570 --> 06:22.090
Well, it was just a thought.

06:23.030 --> 06:24.595
I'm gonna give him
some strained peaches.

06:24.630 --> 06:26.160
That'll give you time
to finish this floor.

06:26.470 --> 06:27.340
Okay.

06:30.750 --> 06:32.440
But it won't take too long.

06:37.840 --> 06:38.680
Hello there.

06:40.960 --> 06:42.420
Oh, you're back.

06:43.240 --> 06:45.630
Hi. I'm Rosie, your new maid.

06:46.100 --> 06:47.380
Are you really?

06:48.140 --> 06:48.885
Tell me, Rosie,

06:48.920 --> 06:51.550
uh, where is that bunion
that I'm married to?

06:51.750 --> 06:52.815
Mrs. Evelyn?

06:52.850 --> 06:55.410
She's in the kitchen with the baby.

06:56.120 --> 06:57.840
Baby? What baby?

06:58.790 --> 07:00.770
I also work for Peri Westmore.

07:00.950 --> 07:02.870
I bring her son here while I clean.

07:03.260 --> 07:04.500
You've done this before?

07:04.640 --> 07:05.910
Many times.

07:08.820 --> 07:09.920
Since you've been
bringing him here,

07:09.955 --> 07:11.230
has, uh, Evelyn...

07:12.380 --> 07:14.550
grown attached to the boy?

07:15.420 --> 07:16.830
How do you know that?

07:17.260 --> 07:18.900
Listen to me, do us both a favor.

07:18.980 --> 07:21.680
Take that child out of this house

07:22.420 --> 07:24.260
and never bring him back here.

07:25.050 --> 07:26.170
Do you understand?

07:27.300 --> 07:30.740
Not really. But I'll go get him.

07:31.660 --> 07:32.580
And, Rosie?

07:33.750 --> 07:37.190
Obviously, you can come
back anytime you want.

07:47.390 --> 07:48.890
Who's all this for?

07:49.010 --> 07:49.950
You.

07:50.540 --> 07:51.390
Me?

07:51.540 --> 07:52.610
Yes.

07:52.900 --> 07:54.980
I made sandwiches!

07:55.500 --> 07:57.510
You don't know how
to make sandwiches.

07:57.545 --> 07:59.500
Well, I know how to order them.

07:59.640 --> 08:01.550
It's practically the same thing.

08:01.980 --> 08:03.600
Please, sit.

08:03.630 --> 08:05.500
Tell me what you want first.

08:05.560 --> 08:06.570
Zoila.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.920
You only get domestic
when you want something.

08:08.955 --> 08:10.585
So let's just skip the roast beef

08:10.620 --> 08:12.410
and go straight to
the ulterior motive.

08:12.445 --> 08:13.625
All I'm trying to do

08:13.660 --> 08:17.040
is have a little
celebration with my friend.

08:17.470 --> 08:20.710
Alfred has agreed to marry me.

08:20.745 --> 08:23.950
Oh, honey! I'm so happy for you.

08:24.770 --> 08:26.260
Thank you.

08:29.130 --> 08:32.445
Now... try the ones with the pesto.

08:32.480 --> 08:35.760
I know how much you love pesto.

08:36.760 --> 08:39.120
So Alfred gave up on
the whole baby thing?

08:39.130 --> 08:41.679
No. He still wants to be a father.

08:41.870 --> 08:45.870
We'll just find a surrogate
to carry the child.

08:45.905 --> 08:47.315
Alfred's lawyer knows

08:47.350 --> 08:49.610
an Ivy League coed who might do it.

08:50.010 --> 08:51.875
That's fantastic.

08:51.910 --> 08:54.180
Of course, we'll also need an egg.

08:54.550 --> 08:56.280
And that's the tricky part.

08:56.740 --> 08:59.710
Alfred doesn't want
some anonymous donor.

09:00.100 --> 09:03.590
He wants the egg to come
from someone we... know and...

09:04.310 --> 09:05.520
trust.

09:11.340 --> 09:13.780
Please tell me you're not
gonna ask me for one of my eggs.

09:15.900 --> 09:17.460
Heavens, no.

09:17.730 --> 09:20.560
Your eggs are almost
as ossified as mine.

09:22.050 --> 09:23.020
Good.

09:23.600 --> 09:25.800
Because I was about
to spit out this pesto

09:25.835 --> 09:27.250
and throw it at you.

09:29.020 --> 09:29.865
No...

09:29.900 --> 09:32.030
we don't want one of your eggs.

09:32.850 --> 09:36.220
We want one of... Valentina's.

09:39.490 --> 09:43.470
Obviously, I wanted to
discuss this with you first.

09:43.700 --> 09:45.310
Aren't you considerate?

09:46.780 --> 09:48.140
Don't be angry.

09:48.340 --> 09:50.145
It's really a compliment.

09:50.180 --> 09:53.930
Alfred thinks Valentina
is bright and lovely--

09:53.965 --> 09:55.430
I don't care.

09:56.240 --> 09:58.150
That old man is not
gonna get his hands

09:58.185 --> 10:00.560
on my daughter's D.N.A.

10:03.240 --> 10:04.865
I know it's a lot to ask.

10:04.900 --> 10:07.710
I don't think you have any
idea what you've asked for,

10:07.745 --> 10:11.460
or how incredibly
insulting this is.

10:11.660 --> 10:12.610
Zoila!

10:13.870 --> 10:16.650
If Valentina doesn't do this,

10:16.685 --> 10:18.640
Alfred will leave me.

10:18.790 --> 10:20.940
Well, then get ready
to say, "Sayonara,"

10:20.975 --> 10:23.235
because it's not gonna happen.

10:23.270 --> 10:25.860
And you are forbidden
from saying a word of this

10:25.895 --> 10:27.940
to Valentina. Do you understand me?

10:34.380 --> 10:36.380
Alejandro, do you have a minute?

10:36.980 --> 10:38.740
Well, I'm sort of working here.

10:38.860 --> 10:39.870
I'm sorry.

10:39.900 --> 10:40.750
It's just...

10:40.760 --> 10:42.420
Odessa has something to tell you.

10:45.270 --> 10:47.670
Obviously, I've been tired lately.

10:47.930 --> 10:49.750
I'm sure you've noticed.

10:50.500 --> 10:52.570
Uh... not really.

10:56.630 --> 10:58.020
The truth is...

10:58.770 --> 10:59.990
I am sick.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.115
I did not want to tell you

11:02.150 --> 11:04.120
because I did not
want you to worry.

11:05.230 --> 11:06.510
Well, that's nice of you.

11:09.610 --> 11:12.550
But I am getting worse.

11:12.560 --> 11:15.050
So we can no longer
keep this a secret.

11:17.150 --> 11:18.570
I have cancer.

11:22.870 --> 11:24.100
Is it serious?

11:25.750 --> 11:27.120
It's cancer.

11:27.960 --> 11:29.900
Yeah, right. Sorry.

11:31.800 --> 11:33.775
So do you need some time off?

11:33.810 --> 11:35.750
No. It's good for me to work.

11:35.785 --> 11:38.315
But while I'm in chemo,

11:38.350 --> 11:40.360
I may have to cut back on hours.

11:40.370 --> 11:42.600
But you don't have to worry
about getting things done.

11:42.635 --> 11:43.645
I can do both jobs.

11:43.680 --> 11:45.570
I am so grateful to Carmen.

11:45.590 --> 11:48.690
She has been... a godsend.

11:48.750 --> 11:49.910
I'm happy to help.

11:55.430 --> 11:56.960
I'm sorry. Is there anything else?

11:58.360 --> 11:59.180
No.

12:01.690 --> 12:03.080
Thank you for your time.

12:11.070 --> 12:11.885
What would you say

12:11.920 --> 12:14.240
if someone told you
they had a fatal disease?

12:14.275 --> 12:15.235
If it was contagious,

12:15.270 --> 12:16.620
I'd tell them to sit over there.

12:17.310 --> 12:19.200
Someone I know has cancer.

12:19.270 --> 12:22.050
Great, now I feel
like a jerk. Thank you.

12:22.140 --> 12:23.830
Who's got cancer?

12:23.990 --> 12:25.120
It's a secret.

12:25.300 --> 12:27.270
I swore on my life I wouldn't tell.

12:27.690 --> 12:29.220
I'll let you have a churro.

12:29.310 --> 12:30.550
It's Odessa.

12:31.900 --> 12:34.150
- Odessa has cancer?
- Yes.

12:34.180 --> 12:35.760
And she told
Alejandro she was sick,

12:35.795 --> 12:37.710
and he barely reacted.

12:37.850 --> 12:39.495
Well, that doesn't
mean he doesn't care.

12:39.530 --> 12:42.770
Some people work hard at
suppressing their emotions.

12:42.805 --> 12:44.737
I once dropped this guy's Grammy,

12:44.772 --> 12:46.670
and he cried like a little girl.

12:46.680 --> 12:48.120
Maybe he was in shock.

12:48.155 --> 12:48.800
No.

12:48.810 --> 12:51.000
I looked into his eyes.
There was no concern,

12:51.035 --> 12:53.490
no compassion. I don't get it.

12:53.540 --> 12:55.825
She has been with
him for ten years.

12:55.860 --> 12:58.110
He's probably more
upset than you think.

12:58.145 --> 12:59.470
You should talk to him.

12:59.990 --> 13:01.450
It would be nice to be wrong.

13:02.510 --> 13:04.810
I gotta go. I'll
see you girls later.

13:04.845 --> 13:05.550
Okay.

13:09.310 --> 13:11.130
This whole thing make you think.

13:11.790 --> 13:12.630
About?

13:12.670 --> 13:14.150
The people we work for.

13:14.840 --> 13:16.860
If we died, would they really care?

13:17.280 --> 13:18.725
Sure, they would.

13:18.760 --> 13:21.590
They might come to our
funeral, shed a tear or two.

13:22.230 --> 13:25.140
But after a few weeks, would
they still think about us

13:25.175 --> 13:27.080
and all we've done for their lives?

13:27.680 --> 13:29.040
It would depend.

13:29.250 --> 13:30.390
On what?

13:31.140 --> 13:33.720
How good the maid
was that replaced us.

13:39.420 --> 13:42.340
Good morning, Mr.
Pettigrove. How are you doing?

13:42.500 --> 13:45.510
I'm in dreadful need of some tea.

13:45.545 --> 13:46.960
I'll get the kettle on.

13:48.420 --> 13:51.395
You know, I've been
here for a few days now,

13:51.430 --> 13:54.370
and it occurs to me I
know so little about you.

13:54.405 --> 13:55.970
There's not much to know.

13:56.280 --> 13:59.090
Why don't you tell me
about your ambitions?

13:59.125 --> 14:00.395
I'm sure you have dreams

14:00.430 --> 14:02.750
that extend beyond domestic work.

14:02.940 --> 14:06.490
Oh, I do. I want to be a designer.

14:06.700 --> 14:09.500
I'll bet you're very talented.

14:09.750 --> 14:10.950
I hope so.

14:11.790 --> 14:14.170
You planning on opening
your own boutique?

14:14.205 --> 14:15.115
First I want to go to

14:15.150 --> 14:17.820
the Los Angeles Academy
of Fashion and Design.

14:18.270 --> 14:20.140
I was accepted there last year.

14:20.540 --> 14:22.360
Then why aren't you in school?

14:22.760 --> 14:24.480
My family can't afford the tuition,

14:24.490 --> 14:27.010
and we are not poor
enough for financial aid.

14:28.560 --> 14:30.850
That's a cruel irony.

14:31.220 --> 14:33.710
That's why I'm working
here-- save money.

14:34.640 --> 14:37.920
How long till you have
the necessary funds?

14:37.955 --> 14:39.150
Couple of years.

14:40.270 --> 14:42.220
It's a really expensive school.

14:44.250 --> 14:45.780
What if I told you there was

14:45.790 --> 14:49.380
a quick and easy way
to get that money?

14:51.750 --> 14:52.980
What do you mean?

14:53.360 --> 14:55.990
Oh, I'm not suggesting
anything untoward.

14:56.025 --> 14:57.000
It's just...

14:57.650 --> 14:59.430
you have something I need.

15:04.700 --> 15:05.825
Excuse me.

15:05.860 --> 15:07.930
- Are you Mirta Hernandez?
- No.

15:07.965 --> 15:09.870
Mirta's my roommate.

15:10.360 --> 15:12.800
I'm Birdie. Birdie Gladwell.

15:12.880 --> 15:14.420
Do you know where she is?

15:14.470 --> 15:15.590
I need to talk to her.

15:15.625 --> 15:16.835
In the courtyard.

15:16.870 --> 15:19.380
Her grandson came for a visit.

15:20.090 --> 15:22.180
No one ever visits me.

15:22.215 --> 15:24.270
Everyone I know is dead.

15:25.750 --> 15:27.790
Yes. Well...

15:28.430 --> 15:30.770
Thank you for your
help, Mrs. Gladwell.

15:30.805 --> 15:32.120
It's "Miss."

15:32.670 --> 15:34.420
I was a lesbian.

15:36.510 --> 15:37.930
Courtyard, you say?

15:51.100 --> 15:52.210
Hey there.

15:53.020 --> 15:54.690
Are you Mirta?

15:54.750 --> 15:55.830
Can I help you?

15:56.110 --> 15:56.985
I hope so.

15:57.020 --> 15:58.250
Is this your grandmother?

15:58.285 --> 15:59.080
Yeah.

15:59.510 --> 16:01.960
Then you must be related
to Flora Hernandez.

16:01.995 --> 16:04.440
Yeah, uh, she was my cousin.

16:05.560 --> 16:06.480
Who are you?

16:06.500 --> 16:08.870
Oh, my name is Marisol.

16:09.050 --> 16:11.420
I need to ask your
grandmother a few questions.

16:11.455 --> 16:14.060
About Flora? No way.

16:14.310 --> 16:16.230
Please. It's important.

16:16.460 --> 16:18.840
My grandmother doesn't
talk about her anymore.

16:19.070 --> 16:20.530
She gets upset.

16:20.850 --> 16:23.035
Listen, I have reason to believe

16:23.070 --> 16:25.380
that the police
arrested the wrong man

16:25.415 --> 16:26.740
for your cousin's murder.

16:26.920 --> 16:29.950
- What?
- And she may have said something to your grandmother

16:29.985 --> 16:32.250
that could help us find
out who really killed her.

16:32.820 --> 16:34.990
My grandma can't help anyone.

16:35.010 --> 16:36.210
The truth is...

16:36.470 --> 16:38.670
she's just not all there anymore.

16:43.840 --> 16:44.850
Are you sure?

16:46.020 --> 16:48.380
Because she seems
pretty interested to me.

16:51.990 --> 16:53.750
You have to leave now.

16:54.340 --> 16:57.325
Don't you think that
Flora deserves justice?

16:57.360 --> 17:00.310
Flora was an embarrassment
to our family.

17:00.770 --> 17:03.830
She was a liar, a
thief, and a whore.

17:04.040 --> 17:05.425
And as far as I'm concerned,

17:05.460 --> 17:07.369
she already got what she deserved.

17:08.400 --> 17:10.285
Tell reception that my grandmother

17:10.319 --> 17:12.170
is no longer accepting visitors.

17:13.390 --> 17:14.560
You got that?

17:20.380 --> 17:22.680
So how come you're not
going back to the Powells'?

17:23.319 --> 17:26.579
I think maybe Mrs. Evelyn
is a little strange.

17:26.680 --> 17:29.730
Well, I'm glad you were able
to earn some extra money.

17:29.765 --> 17:30.920
That was nice.

17:30.930 --> 17:31.825
But now that you're back,

17:31.860 --> 17:33.830
I'd rather be here
looking after you.

17:34.460 --> 17:36.170
So, is Tucker asleep?

17:36.470 --> 17:38.070
Yeah, I just put him down.

17:38.150 --> 17:38.925
Excellent.

17:38.960 --> 17:40.330
What are you doing?

17:40.490 --> 17:42.200
My doctor said I
needed to exercise.

17:42.235 --> 17:44.250
Hmm, in that case...

17:45.630 --> 17:46.620
What's this?

17:46.840 --> 17:48.860
Stuff you can help me with.

17:49.950 --> 17:51.620
Fix the doorbell, hang the mirror,

17:51.630 --> 17:52.735
hook up the new tv.

17:52.770 --> 17:54.410
Now this is not
the kind of exercise

17:54.445 --> 17:54.955
that I had in mind.

17:54.990 --> 17:57.270
I know what you had in
mind, and the answer is "No."

17:57.280 --> 17:58.345
Oh, come on.

17:58.380 --> 18:00.620
I missed you so much.
Didn't you miss me?

18:00.770 --> 18:04.360
No! You can't be doing that.

18:04.950 --> 18:06.910
- Why not?
- I told you.

18:06.945 --> 18:08.870
You just had a heart attack.

18:08.905 --> 18:10.070
Please.

18:11.160 --> 18:13.930
My heart stops
every time I see you.

18:15.980 --> 18:20.910
Okay. We can have sex,
but just to be safe...

18:21.250 --> 18:22.880
Let me do all the work.

18:23.480 --> 18:24.390
Okay.

18:24.750 --> 18:26.005
Just to be safe.

18:48.900 --> 18:51.200
Boy, I wish you'd
fixed that doorbell.

18:59.440 --> 19:00.620
Hello, Mrs. Evelyn.

19:00.650 --> 19:01.580
Rosie.

19:02.360 --> 19:04.180
I had a feeling you'd drop by.

19:10.230 --> 19:11.260
So...

19:12.640 --> 19:14.910
An affair with
Spence Westmore--

19:15.480 --> 19:17.340
That's a feather in your sombrero.

19:17.375 --> 19:18.915
I'm not proud of myself.

19:18.950 --> 19:21.640
I'm sure that will be
oh-so-soothing to Mrs. Westmore.

19:21.675 --> 19:23.990
See, that's why I'm here.

19:24.380 --> 19:27.075
Mrs. Peri can never
find out about this.

19:27.110 --> 19:29.530
- You think she'd be devastated?
- She would.

19:29.670 --> 19:32.110
And Mr. Spence doesn't
wanna get a divorce.

19:32.380 --> 19:34.550
He might lose custody of his son.

19:34.810 --> 19:36.255
Exactly.

19:36.290 --> 19:38.450
See, that's the
problem with adultery--

19:38.900 --> 19:41.010
the piper must be paid.

19:42.400 --> 19:44.705
I don't know who this piper is,

19:44.740 --> 19:47.010
but you can't tell him neither.

19:47.600 --> 19:50.160
I wouldn't dream of saying
a word to Peri Westmore.

19:50.170 --> 19:51.190
Do you know why?

19:52.700 --> 19:54.660
Because I consider you a friend.

19:54.690 --> 19:56.525
Oh, thank you.

19:56.560 --> 20:00.350
Which is why I was so hurt
when you stopped working here.

20:00.880 --> 20:02.630
A terse note left on
the kitchen counter--

20:02.665 --> 20:03.640
I deserve better than that.

20:03.675 --> 20:04.505
I'm sorry.

20:04.540 --> 20:07.450
It's just with Mr. Spence
being home from the hospital--

20:07.485 --> 20:10.420
I know. You had to
tend to his... needs.

20:11.430 --> 20:13.710
- I didn't mean to hurt you.
- But you did.

20:13.730 --> 20:14.465
You left me,

20:14.500 --> 20:16.330
and you took that sweet
little boy with you.

20:18.070 --> 20:19.510
I know it seems odd,

20:20.630 --> 20:23.440
but I've come to
depend upon that child.

20:23.475 --> 20:25.670
He brings color into my drab life,

20:25.705 --> 20:27.180
and I want him back.

20:28.430 --> 20:29.740
That can't happen.

20:29.775 --> 20:30.710
Why not?

20:31.320 --> 20:34.080
Well... it's complicated.

20:34.350 --> 20:36.690
No... it's not.

20:37.050 --> 20:38.535
You'll come twice a week.

20:38.570 --> 20:40.980
You will bring Tucker
Westmore, and in exchange,

20:41.015 --> 20:43.390
I will not tell the entire
city of Beverly Hills

20:43.425 --> 20:45.100
that his father's
screwing the maid.

20:46.250 --> 20:47.130
Now...

20:47.480 --> 20:49.760
what could be simpler than that?

21:00.140 --> 21:02.700
So... I have good news.

21:03.190 --> 21:05.610
Well, don't just keep
it to yourself. A ver.

21:05.980 --> 21:08.220
I'm gonna start fashion
school next fall.

21:09.540 --> 21:11.910
They changed their mind
about the scholarship!

21:12.900 --> 21:14.010
Not exactly.

21:15.130 --> 21:17.160
I found a way to pay the tuition.

21:18.210 --> 21:19.520
How did you do that?

21:20.560 --> 21:22.535
Mr. Pettigrove came to me.

21:22.570 --> 21:25.720
He told me about Mrs. Delatour
and what she asked you.

21:25.755 --> 21:26.685
Oh, my God.

21:26.720 --> 21:30.630
And now he's offering to pay
my tuition if I help them.

21:31.560 --> 21:33.150
Absolutely not.

21:33.780 --> 21:37.130
Mami... this is what
we always dreamed of.

21:37.165 --> 21:38.590
I'll get to go to school.

21:38.920 --> 21:41.100
By selling a part of yourself?

21:41.650 --> 21:44.160
I didn't raise you
to be this stupid

21:44.195 --> 21:45.740
or this desperate.

21:46.810 --> 21:48.680
I wouldn't just do this for myself.

21:48.890 --> 21:50.650
I'd be doing it for you, too.

21:51.100 --> 21:52.500
For me?

21:52.750 --> 21:55.030
I see the sacrifices you make,

21:55.070 --> 21:58.475
how hard you work on
weekends and holidays--

21:58.510 --> 22:01.100
just to make a few extra bucks
that you end up giving to me.

22:01.135 --> 22:02.700
I don't complain about that.

22:02.930 --> 22:04.640
Which makes it even worse!

22:06.480 --> 22:08.930
Now it's my chance to help you.

22:09.560 --> 22:10.865
If the tuition is paid for,

22:10.900 --> 22:13.160
you could finally stop
and take some time off.

22:13.195 --> 22:14.455
Do you really think

22:14.490 --> 22:17.540
that I would trade a
grandchild for a vacation?!

22:17.610 --> 22:18.900
It's just an egg.

22:19.590 --> 22:22.300
And this money would
change our lives.

22:22.335 --> 22:25.187
This decision would
change our lives

22:25.222 --> 22:28.040
in ways you can't
begin to understand.

22:31.110 --> 22:32.940
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

22:33.500 --> 22:35.640
But I will not
allow you to do this.

22:43.430 --> 22:45.000
Mami, you can't stop me.

22:47.290 --> 22:48.810
What did you say?

22:49.370 --> 22:51.555
It's my body, so it's my decision.

22:51.590 --> 22:53.740
And I'm doing this for both of us,

22:53.775 --> 22:55.570
whether you like it or not.

23:03.370 --> 23:04.345
You gotta be kidding!

23:04.380 --> 23:05.855
- I wish I was.
- I mean, come on!

23:05.890 --> 23:08.200
Who blackmails people to
have a chance to babysit?

23:08.235 --> 23:09.325
I know. It's weird.

23:09.360 --> 23:11.730
But Mrs. Evelyn is
obsessed with Tucker!

23:11.765 --> 23:14.100
- But why?
- I talked to my friend Marisol.

23:14.135 --> 23:16.060
She used to work for the Powells.

23:16.560 --> 23:18.800
She said they had a son who died.

23:21.550 --> 23:24.100
So she's working out her
emotional issues with my kid?

23:24.135 --> 23:25.360
Fantastic.

23:25.850 --> 23:26.915
What are we gonna do?

23:26.950 --> 23:29.530
Well, I'm not letting Tucker
within 50 feet of that lunatic.

23:29.565 --> 23:30.710
Obviously.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.790
But she will tell Mrs.
Peri about us, I know it!

23:35.860 --> 23:36.720
You know what?

23:37.650 --> 23:38.410
Let her.

23:38.940 --> 23:40.670
Mr. Spence.

23:41.490 --> 23:43.110
I just had a heart attack.

23:44.210 --> 23:46.540
"Life is short" is more
than a theory to me.

23:47.280 --> 23:49.410
I gotta be with someone
who can make me happy.

23:49.880 --> 23:52.110
Mrs. Peri wants to make you happy.

23:52.220 --> 23:53.540
Well, she had her chance.

23:54.630 --> 23:56.280
You gotta give her another one.

23:57.260 --> 23:57.870
Why?

23:59.300 --> 24:01.250
When Mrs. Evelyn caught us,

24:02.210 --> 24:04.300
I saw our reflection in the glass.

24:04.590 --> 24:07.050
And we looked like bad people.

24:07.580 --> 24:09.330
If you try to make
your marriage work

24:09.365 --> 24:10.840
and it doesn't,

24:11.400 --> 24:14.070
then maybe we can
talk about the future.

24:15.610 --> 24:18.160
But I need to know you tried, okay?

24:20.640 --> 24:21.560
Okay.

24:26.830 --> 24:27.605
So what are we gonna do

24:27.640 --> 24:29.560
about the crazy lady
that wants my kid?

24:31.610 --> 24:33.720
Maybe we should talk to the guy

24:33.755 --> 24:35.830
that was crazy enough to marry her.

24:47.270 --> 24:50.910
I did not know Alfred
spoke to Valentina.

24:51.040 --> 24:52.450
You must believe me.

24:53.310 --> 24:54.140
I do.

24:56.840 --> 25:00.380
So, is Valentina going
to go through with it?

25:00.710 --> 25:01.990
She wants to.

25:04.520 --> 25:06.340
But you're gonna
talk her out of it.

25:07.570 --> 25:09.790
You can't ask me to do that.

25:09.825 --> 25:11.565
Alfred will leave me.

25:11.600 --> 25:12.835
Let's put aside for the moment

25:12.870 --> 25:15.350
that this egg will
become my grandchild.

25:15.630 --> 25:19.470
He or she will be raised
by a man in his 70s and you.

25:19.710 --> 25:21.890
Alfred will be a wonderful father.

25:21.950 --> 25:23.605
I'm sure he'll be devoted...

25:23.640 --> 25:25.530
during the few years he has left.

25:26.380 --> 25:28.035
That's what's
bothering you-- his age?

25:28.070 --> 25:31.270
What's bothering me is
the idea that he'll die

25:31.305 --> 25:33.900
and the baby will be left with you.

25:35.640 --> 25:37.280
That's a silly thing to say.

25:37.400 --> 25:39.030
You know I'm a good mother.

25:41.470 --> 25:42.370
Zoila.

25:42.490 --> 25:44.490
I'm not saying you don't love Remi.

25:44.525 --> 25:46.490
I know you do. You just never...

25:47.400 --> 25:48.860
put him first.

25:49.310 --> 25:52.000
- That's not true.
- I was there!

25:52.035 --> 25:53.395
I saw you fall apart

25:53.430 --> 25:55.880
each time husband
number whatever left you.

25:55.915 --> 25:58.330
And you'd make Remi
pick up the pieces.

25:58.390 --> 26:00.990
God, how many times did
you interrupt his childhood

26:01.025 --> 26:02.590
pulling crap like that?

26:03.260 --> 26:06.250
So what if I was a
little unstable back then?

26:06.920 --> 26:09.890
Remi has turned out beautifully.

26:09.925 --> 26:11.592
That's what matters.

26:11.627 --> 26:13.260
He has problems.

26:14.280 --> 26:17.430
And you won't pay attention
long enough to see them.

26:19.750 --> 26:21.300
What kind of problems?

26:25.150 --> 26:26.020
Sweetie...

26:27.610 --> 26:30.310
Remi is not on a ski trip.

26:31.260 --> 26:32.100
Where is he?

26:34.060 --> 26:35.500
He's in rehab.

26:36.660 --> 26:37.900
He's using again.

26:40.120 --> 26:41.810
Why didn't anyone tell me?

26:42.040 --> 26:44.060
We were worried you'd fall apart.

26:45.290 --> 26:48.370
You didn't even give me
a chance. That's not fair.

26:48.960 --> 26:51.000
After all I've said...

26:51.950 --> 26:54.120
are you really gonna
make this about you?

26:56.720 --> 26:58.050
Is he gonna be okay?

26:58.900 --> 27:00.570
We don't know.

27:02.050 --> 27:03.290
That is why

27:03.870 --> 27:08.720
you need to tell my daughter
that you don't want her child.

27:09.980 --> 27:12.100
You need to look after your own.

27:24.290 --> 27:26.870
Hello. I'm here to
see Birdie Gladwell.

27:31.830 --> 27:33.385
Hello, Birdie.

27:33.420 --> 27:36.370
Well, look who the cat dragged in.

27:36.930 --> 27:38.190
Hey, Mirta!

27:40.400 --> 27:42.170
Don't take it personally.

27:42.390 --> 27:45.090
She's just having
one of her bad days.

27:45.125 --> 27:46.900
What's that?

27:47.630 --> 27:50.190
I bought you a little something.

27:50.580 --> 27:53.690
Well, aren't you
the sweetest thing?

27:56.210 --> 27:57.735
It's silk.

27:57.770 --> 27:58.840
Do you like it?

27:59.040 --> 28:02.080
Beats the piece of
crap my niece knit.

28:02.115 --> 28:03.700
You know... Birdie,

28:04.240 --> 28:07.070
I bet those nurses would
like to see your new scarf.

28:07.630 --> 28:10.130
They'll be green with envy.

28:12.260 --> 28:14.020
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

28:19.400 --> 28:20.630
Hello, Mirta.

28:21.540 --> 28:22.810
I'm Marisol.

28:25.280 --> 28:27.510
I just want to talk to you
about your granddaughter.

28:32.860 --> 28:33.620
Flora?

28:34.120 --> 28:35.645
Yes! Yes!

28:35.680 --> 28:37.070
I want to talk about flora.

28:39.250 --> 28:41.120
Why don't you come to see me?

28:42.020 --> 28:42.610
What?

28:43.850 --> 28:45.920
Are you angry with your abuelita?

28:58.030 --> 28:58.720
No.

28:59.440 --> 29:00.690
I'm not angry.

29:01.480 --> 29:04.530
I did not mean to
yell the last time.

29:04.565 --> 29:06.580
What you
said, it--it--

29:07.070 --> 29:09.150
it made me so ashamed.

29:10.370 --> 29:11.860
What did I say, abuela?

29:12.300 --> 29:13.610
How did I shame you?

29:15.320 --> 29:18.100
You were a bad girl, mijita.

29:18.560 --> 29:21.580
That boy--he--
he loves you.

29:22.060 --> 29:23.000
What boy?

29:24.170 --> 29:25.070
Eddie.

29:26.000 --> 29:27.070
Who else?

29:28.630 --> 29:29.970
I told you about Eddie?

29:30.005 --> 29:31.265
He loves you.

29:31.300 --> 29:33.930
I-I can see in his eyes.

29:34.190 --> 29:35.590
That's nice to hear.

29:35.840 --> 29:38.670
But you-- you are
so cruel to him.

29:40.430 --> 29:41.240
I am?

29:41.860 --> 29:43.390
The way you talk to him.

29:43.830 --> 29:46.050
Y-you take him for granted.

29:49.380 --> 29:50.980
Do you think I love Eddie...

29:51.790 --> 29:52.490
at all?

29:54.950 --> 29:56.410
In your own way.

29:57.540 --> 29:58.875
But he's not gonna marry you

29:58.910 --> 30:00.950
when he finds out you're pregnant.

30:02.220 --> 30:03.295
I told you about that?

30:03.330 --> 30:06.860
Oh, to cheat on such a nice boy.

30:07.470 --> 30:09.450
And with his friend?

30:10.680 --> 30:11.890
His friend?

30:13.230 --> 30:15.050
Did you just say "his friend"?

30:19.230 --> 30:20.360
Abuela?

30:21.310 --> 30:22.900
Oh, no, no, no, no.

30:22.910 --> 30:25.000
No, don't leave me. Stay with me.

30:25.370 --> 30:26.950
This is important.

30:50.990 --> 30:53.370
Thank you, Carmen.

31:01.310 --> 31:02.790
I'm sorry. Is there something else?

31:03.100 --> 31:03.825
I thought you should know

31:03.860 --> 31:05.700
Odessa's having her chemo tonight.

31:07.820 --> 31:08.870
Good for her.

31:11.080 --> 31:13.470
Well, if you wanted to visit her,

31:13.910 --> 31:15.510
I-I know she would appreciate it.

31:16.820 --> 31:18.300
Well, I'd love to, but I'm...

31:19.040 --> 31:20.510
swamped with work tonight.

31:23.590 --> 31:25.320
Well, she goes in two days a week.

31:25.490 --> 31:27.385
So if you can't visit her tonight,

31:27.420 --> 31:29.280
maybe you can stop by next Tuesday?

31:31.330 --> 31:32.430
I got
a--

31:32.550 --> 31:33.920
I got a thing next Tuesday.

31:33.955 --> 31:35.080
I'll tell you what.

31:35.870 --> 31:38.000
Buy Odessa some flowers...

31:40.310 --> 31:41.630
That should cheer her up.

31:49.170 --> 31:51.310
I'm annoyed. Can you tell?

31:51.410 --> 31:52.855
Have you lost your mind?!

31:52.890 --> 31:56.625
Odessa has worked
here for ten years.

31:56.660 --> 31:59.220
She has cooked and cleaned
and made up your bed

31:59.230 --> 32:01.270
and sewn buttons on your shirts.

32:01.320 --> 32:04.340
This is not just a job
for her. She adores you!

32:04.490 --> 32:06.320
I don't understand
why you can't give her

32:06.355 --> 32:08.115
- two lousy hours of your life!
- Calm down.

32:08.150 --> 32:12.230
Don't ever tell a Puerto
Rican woman to calm down.

32:12.265 --> 32:13.455
It's a waste of time!

32:13.490 --> 32:15.050
You keep talking to me like this,

32:15.060 --> 32:16.550
I'll have to fire you.

32:17.390 --> 32:18.805
I just gave you my notice.

32:18.840 --> 32:20.220
It's right there on the floor.

32:20.940 --> 32:22.060
You're quitting?

32:22.850 --> 32:24.590
Yes, I am.

32:26.000 --> 32:29.690
I only took this job because
I admired you so much.

32:29.970 --> 32:32.090
But after seeing the
way you treat people,

32:32.530 --> 32:34.750
you're no longer who I
wanna be when I grow up.

32:57.370 --> 32:58.500
You look good.

32:58.990 --> 33:00.450
Have you been able to relax?

33:00.485 --> 33:02.340
Not really.

33:02.410 --> 33:03.730
Since you were away,
I've had to meet with

33:03.765 --> 33:05.790
our broker, my
trainer, your lawyer,

33:05.825 --> 33:07.015
that caterer we both adore,

33:07.050 --> 33:09.420
and that personal
shopper we both despise.

33:09.455 --> 33:11.440
All that, and you still had time

33:11.475 --> 33:13.310
to blackmail the neighbors.

33:14.610 --> 33:16.760
You must be referring
to Spence Westmore.

33:17.490 --> 33:18.815
What could you have been thinking?

33:18.850 --> 33:21.330
Well, you know how I feel
about men who seduce the help.

33:21.365 --> 33:22.580
Just trying to teach him a lesson.

33:22.615 --> 33:24.380
I'm talking about the child.

33:28.070 --> 33:29.230
That was nothing.

33:29.300 --> 33:31.460
You demanded Rosie
bring him to our house.

33:33.990 --> 33:36.780
You haven't met
Tucker. He's special.

33:37.620 --> 33:39.490
I won't let this happen again.

33:39.880 --> 33:42.045
This isn't like last time. I swear.

33:42.080 --> 33:44.210
I've already made an
appointment with Dr. Weiller.

33:44.220 --> 33:46.230
I lost a son, and I
continue to grieve.

33:46.265 --> 33:47.725
That doesn't make me crazy.

33:47.760 --> 33:49.420
When you mistake
another woman's child

33:49.455 --> 33:51.242
for the one you buried...

33:51.277 --> 33:53.058
I wasn't confused this time.

33:53.093 --> 33:54.840
I always knew he wasn't mine.

33:54.850 --> 33:56.940
Well, I think you're still sick.

33:57.550 --> 33:58.945
And I'm gonna get you help.

33:58.980 --> 34:00.340
Is it sick to want affection?

34:02.300 --> 34:04.510
That's what children give--
even other people's children.

34:04.545 --> 34:06.720
They look into your eyes,
and they instantly love you.

34:06.755 --> 34:08.550
It's the most amazing thing.

34:08.585 --> 34:09.650
Adrian...

34:09.679 --> 34:11.050
I miss seeing love
in someone's eyes.

34:11.085 --> 34:12.420
I wondered how long
it would take you

34:12.455 --> 34:13.534
to lay this at my doorstep.

34:13.570 --> 34:16.210
Well, why shouldn't I?
I may be off the beam,

34:16.245 --> 34:17.264
but you're the one who pushed me.

34:17.300 --> 34:20.280
What, you think I choose
to be cold and unforgiving?

34:20.800 --> 34:22.280
Barrett was hit by a car.

34:22.830 --> 34:24.139
It was an accident.

34:24.690 --> 34:26.540
Isn't it time that you forgave me?

34:27.600 --> 34:28.730
I have tried.

34:30.500 --> 34:31.690
Try again.

34:34.350 --> 34:35.425
And I will forgive you

34:35.460 --> 34:37.530
every act of debauchery
you have ever committed.

34:37.540 --> 34:39.429
You can commit new
ones for all I care.

34:39.560 --> 34:40.659
Just...

34:43.310 --> 34:45.350
Look at me the way you used to.

34:46.330 --> 34:47.449
Please.

34:55.170 --> 34:56.790
Oh, god.

35:39.250 --> 35:41.420
So your son is in rehab?

35:42.030 --> 35:43.515
At a clinic in the desert.

35:43.550 --> 35:45.700
I'm gonna go visit
him for a few days.

35:45.890 --> 35:49.070
I'm sure he'll appreciate
the show of support.

35:49.105 --> 35:50.650
I certainly hope so.

35:54.010 --> 35:55.180
By the way...

35:57.520 --> 36:00.700
I had a long talk with
Valentina this morning.

36:03.530 --> 36:07.700
She's no longer interested
in giving us one of her eggs.

36:09.090 --> 36:11.510
She seemed interested yesterday.

36:12.810 --> 36:15.530
Like I said, it was a long talk.

36:16.090 --> 36:17.750
We discussed this.

36:18.300 --> 36:20.405
If you can't give me a child...

36:20.440 --> 36:23.250
You have to go
elsewhere, I understand.

36:24.140 --> 36:28.080
You don't sound particularly
sad to see me go.

36:28.990 --> 36:31.380
Oh, but I am.

36:33.940 --> 36:36.660
You are a very sweet man, Alfred.

36:37.180 --> 36:39.460
And I will miss you very much.

36:43.480 --> 36:44.840
My car is here.

36:44.990 --> 36:46.385
I'm gonna have to go.

36:46.420 --> 36:49.140
Are you absolutely sure about this?

36:50.360 --> 36:52.880
I was gonna spoil you rotten.

36:54.230 --> 36:55.800
Oh, Alfred...

36:57.750 --> 37:00.210
It's not about me anymore.

37:01.970 --> 37:03.410
Isn't it amazing?

37:25.810 --> 37:27.230
So what are you thinking?

37:28.950 --> 37:30.110
Nothing.

37:33.190 --> 37:35.165
Hey. How about...

37:35.200 --> 37:37.610
I go get us some ice cream
at the cafeteria? Hmm?

37:39.120 --> 37:40.390
If you like.

37:40.810 --> 37:41.730
Here.

37:52.120 --> 37:53.180
You came.

37:54.820 --> 37:55.820
Yeah.

37:58.210 --> 38:00.140
Odessa's gonna be so happy.

38:00.870 --> 38:01.970
Yeah, I, uh...

38:02.890 --> 38:05.390
I didn't know what I would
talk about for two hours.

38:06.260 --> 38:07.820
So... I thought maybe
I could sing to her.

38:08.980 --> 38:10.850
I think she'll be thrilled.

38:14.250 --> 38:16.370
You know the worst
part about being a star?

38:17.690 --> 38:19.000
Is people stop kicking your ass,

38:19.035 --> 38:20.310
and they start kissing it...

38:20.660 --> 38:21.800
constantly.

38:22.990 --> 38:24.360
I don't want that.

38:24.790 --> 38:27.310
Well, I'm happy to kick your ass

38:27.345 --> 38:28.760
anytime you need it.

38:29.980 --> 38:31.460
Sounds like you're not quitting.

38:31.470 --> 38:32.880
Don't listen to a
Puerto Rican woman

38:32.915 --> 38:34.670
when she's hysterical.

38:34.960 --> 38:36.510
We always exaggerate.

38:36.950 --> 38:38.040
Come on.

38:39.070 --> 38:40.190
Odessa...

38:42.230 --> 38:43.880
Someone is here to see you.

38:45.230 --> 38:46.570
Alejandro!

38:47.040 --> 38:49.640
Well, hello there.
How are you doing?

38:49.950 --> 38:51.465
You didn't need to come.

38:51.500 --> 38:52.980
Ah, of course I did.

38:53.900 --> 38:55.510
Are you ready to be entertained?

38:56.180 --> 38:58.030
You're going to sing to me?

38:59.240 --> 39:00.850
I won't even charge you for it.

39:02.340 --> 39:04.130
This is very exciting.

39:05.040 --> 39:07.230
Here's a little something
from my latest album.

39:07.560 --> 39:08.810
I hope you like it.

39:10.420 --> 39:12.620
♪Tus miradas♪

39:13.380 --> 39:16.480
♪Las palabras que florecen♪

39:16.515 --> 39:19.350
♪en tus labio♪

39:30.530 --> 39:32.270
I talked to Mrs. Delatour.

39:34.930 --> 39:37.200
She broke up with Mr. Pettigrove.

39:37.235 --> 39:39.470
So... they won't be needing my egg.

39:40.010 --> 39:41.300
Thank God.

39:43.380 --> 39:45.410
I'm sorry for the
way I spoke to you.

39:45.820 --> 39:47.940
I was just excited
about going to school

39:48.340 --> 39:49.440
and helping you.

39:51.480 --> 39:52.810
I've been thinking.

39:54.400 --> 39:57.470
Many years ago, Mrs.
Delatour gave me a ring.

39:58.100 --> 39:59.890
It's sort of expensive.

40:03.620 --> 40:05.590
I've been saving it for...

40:08.280 --> 40:10.700
I don't know. Maybe I've
been saving it for this.

40:12.410 --> 40:15.120
Anyway, I'm gonna sell it
to pay for your tuition.

40:16.520 --> 40:18.110
Mami!

40:22.760 --> 40:24.870
All right. Enough of that.

40:25.980 --> 40:28.500
- There's a bulb out in the guest room.
- I'll go change it.

40:30.960 --> 40:32.160
One more thing.

40:34.630 --> 40:36.390
Whatever sacrifices I made for you,

40:36.425 --> 40:38.350
are none of your business.

40:38.790 --> 40:41.200
All you gotta do is
grow up and be happy.

40:41.710 --> 40:44.220
Then I'll have everything
I've ever wanted, okay?

41:09.000 --> 41:10.060
- Oh!
- Sorry...

41:10.480 --> 41:11.740
I rang the bell.

41:12.360 --> 41:14.590
I know. It's broken.

41:14.600 --> 41:16.990
You got a moment? I have good news.

41:17.025 --> 41:18.140
Yes.

41:18.400 --> 41:21.130
But Mrs. Peri's plane
landed 20 minutes ago.

41:21.165 --> 41:23.220
We're expecting her any second.

41:23.240 --> 41:24.415
I spoke to my wife.

41:24.450 --> 41:26.530
She will not say a word to anyone

41:26.565 --> 41:28.270
about what she saw here.

41:28.390 --> 41:29.890
Thank God.

41:30.090 --> 41:31.380
And the baby?

41:32.370 --> 41:35.840
Her interest in Tucker
has been... resolved.

41:35.870 --> 41:38.170
Oh, this is such a relief.

41:38.890 --> 41:41.090
Thank you for your
help, Mr. Adrian.

41:41.125 --> 41:42.770
I really owe you one.
