HARRIETTE: Hey, Carl. Hurry up.
Your mama is gonna be here any minute.

01:28.054 --> 01:31.217
You know, baby? I've been thinking.

01:32.258 --> 01:34.123
Mama doesn't have to come live with us.

01:34.294 --> 01:36.728
She can live with my brother, Frank,
in New York.

01:36.896 --> 01:40.696
I mean, he does have that big apartment
and it's just him living there.

01:40.867 --> 01:42.926
I'm gonna call Frank.

01:43.436 --> 01:46.564
Your mother hasn't liked Frank
since he took est.

01:47.006 --> 01:50.169
Well, what about my other brothers?
Walter or Calvin?

01:50.343 --> 01:51.571
Now, Calvin owes me.

01:51.744 --> 01:54.872
I helped put that boy through college.
I'm gonna call Calvin.

01:57.784 --> 02:00.082
What is it with you?
Your mother is a sweet lady.

02:00.253 --> 02:01.811
I'm gonna love having her here.

02:02.255 --> 02:05.053
Oh, see, I get it.

02:05.225 --> 02:08.251
See, you think that the woman
who's coming to live with us...

02:08.428 --> 02:11.864
...is the same woman you see
when we go visit for Thanksgiving.

02:12.031 --> 02:14.795
Well, you see, baby,
that's where you're wrong.

02:17.137 --> 02:20.436
See, that's the holiday mother.
That's the one who says:

02:20.607 --> 02:24.441
[IN A FEMALE VOICE] "Oh, Harriette, you're
looking more beautiful every time I see you."

02:24.611 --> 02:28.240
[IN NORMAL VOICE]
But the real Mother Winslow is different.

02:28.815 --> 02:31.613
She takes over everything.

02:31.784 --> 02:35.345
Harriette, if we let her in here,
she will be running our lives.

02:35.522 --> 02:39.083
She'll tell us when to eat,
what time to sleep...

02:39.325 --> 02:43.056
Oh, my... Harriette, she'll me put me
on a diet.

02:43.229 --> 02:45.823
And I will waste away to nothing.

02:46.499 --> 02:49.297
Carl, we're talking about your mother.

02:49.469 --> 02:50.834
Not a magician.

02:55.008 --> 02:57.374
Okay, forget that. What about this?

02:58.611 --> 03:01.205
We can move to Miami. She hates bugs.

Let it go.

JUDY:
Let me hold him.

03:06.252 --> 03:08.914
No. Aunt Rachel said I can take care
of little Richie.

03:09.088 --> 03:11.818
- I wanna hold him.
- You can hold him when you get older.

03:11.991 --> 03:15.222
When I get older,
he won't be a baby anymore.

03:15.795 --> 03:18.423
Hey, stuff happens.

03:20.800 --> 03:24.600
What are you doing?
You put out all these fresh flowers.

03:25.038 --> 03:27.802
Now, Mama is gonna expect
fresh flowers in here every day.

03:27.974 --> 03:31.842
I am not paying for fresh flowers
in this house every day.

03:32.178 --> 03:33.702
These are from our backyard.

03:33.880 --> 03:35.677
All you're paying for is manure.

03:42.322 --> 03:44.722
Okay, how about this?

03:45.525 --> 03:49.757
We buy an RV, stick Mama in it
and don't give her a key to the house.

03:55.068 --> 03:58.003
Mom, today I'm gonna do your laundry.

03:58.171 --> 04:00.833
And after that, I'm gonna wash your car
and mow the lawn.

04:02.175 --> 04:05.474
Who are you
and what have you done with our son?

04:06.412 --> 04:08.812
Forget about our son.
Let's keep this one.

04:09.749 --> 04:13.685
- Okay, Edward. What do you want?
- Well, there's one small thing...

04:13.853 --> 04:15.582
Eddie's back.

04:17.223 --> 04:20.158
Um, Tony's having a few people over tonight
to watch some TV.

04:20.326 --> 04:21.623
Can I go, please?

04:22.495 --> 04:26.625
Now you see, there's a catch here
and it's up to us to find it.

04:26.799 --> 04:28.426
You're the cop.

04:32.505 --> 04:35.065
- Ahem. Tony's parents gonna be there?
- Of course.

04:35.241 --> 04:36.435

- No. No.

Eddie, you know your curfew is 10.

04:45.418 --> 04:49.252
Hey, I don't need an answer now.
Take some time. Think about it.

04:49.422 --> 04:51.788
I'll just be outside rotating your tires.

04:55.428 --> 04:57.328
We should tell him he's wasting his time.

- You could open the door.

Well, I thought
since it was Grandma's first day...

14:20.693 --> 14:22.558
...dinner should be special.

Amen.

14:50.155 --> 14:53.420
So, Eddie, big plans for tonight, huh?

14:53.826 --> 14:57.785
Well, I had planned to go to a party,
but Dad won't let me go.

14:57.963 --> 15:00.591
Well, your father's got your best interests
at heart.

15:02.034 --> 15:03.968
Thank you, Mama.

15:04.136 --> 15:08.368
You shouldn't be going to wild parties
where there may be drinking, carousing...

15:08.540 --> 15:09.871
...and who knows what all.

15:10.709 --> 15:12.540
Mama, there's not gonna be any of that.

15:12.711 --> 15:16.272
It's just a bunch of kids
sitting around watching TV until real late.

15:16.782 --> 15:20.343
- Watching TV? That's it?
CARL: Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

15:20.686 --> 15:23.814
The only reason Dad won't let me go
is because my curfew's at 10.

15:23.989 --> 15:27.288
Ten? Ha-ha-ha. You gotta be kidding.

15:27.459 --> 15:31.987
Oh, Carl. It's almost the '90s.
Lighten up.

15:33.032 --> 15:34.693
Lighten up?

15:35.401 --> 15:38.427
Eddie, you go to that party
and have a good time.

15:38.604 --> 15:42.973
Why, in France, 15-year-old boys
can stay out as late as they like.

15:43.142 --> 15:46.202
Well, Mother, when he's in France,
he can stay out all night long.

15:46.378 --> 15:49.006
But in this country,
the boy's curfew is still 10:00.

15:49.181 --> 15:51.445
And that's final.

15:51.617 --> 15:55.053
It's not fair! I'm 15 years old
and you're treating me like I'm a kid!

15:55.220 --> 15:56.812
Edward.

15:57.022 --> 15:58.819
I'll talk with him.

16:02.094 --> 16:05.222
Give a man a badge...

16:12.204 --> 16:14.604
Well, I talked to Eddie.

16:14.773 --> 16:17.333
He said he's not coming out of his room
until he's 18...

16:17.509 --> 16:19.739
...and then he's moving to France.

16:19.912 --> 16:24.246
Well, now, that's it.
This is all my mother's fault, Harriette.

16:24.416 --> 16:26.145
This time she's gone too far.

16:26.452 --> 16:29.148
She has got to know
she can't run this house.

16:29.321 --> 16:31.653
She can't interfere
with the way we raise our kids.

16:31.824 --> 16:35.988
And she has got to know
that she cannot sit in my chair.

16:37.329 --> 16:39.229
- You're right.
- Well, I'm glad you agree.

16:39.398 --> 16:41.093
So now go tell her.

16:41.633 --> 16:43.533
Me? She's your mother.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.437
You're the one that told her
she could move in here.

16:46.605 --> 16:49.130
- She's your mother.
- But she likes you.

16:49.441 --> 16:51.136
She's your mother.

Well, Ma, I don't quite know
how to say this. It's...

It's a very delicate thing
and I don't wanna hurt your feelings.

You're gonna sit right here.
We're gonna work this thing out.

Mother, I know that it's been hard for you
ever since Dad died.

18:23.869 --> 18:27.669
I mean, you had to raise five sons
and work at the same time.

18:28.507 --> 18:30.099
You got used to being in charge...

18:30.275 --> 18:32.607
...and when you came here,
you naturally took over.

18:32.778 --> 18:34.473
I was just trying to help.

18:34.847 --> 18:38.408
Well, Mother,
I know that you meant well.

18:38.817 --> 18:41.251
But look at me.

18:41.420 --> 18:43.320
I am not your little boy anymore.

18:44.556 --> 18:48.322
I'm all grown up with a family of my own.

18:50.028 --> 18:52.758
Mother, I know moving in here
wasn't gonna be easy for you.

18:53.398 --> 18:56.026
And I must admit I had my doubts.

18:56.935 --> 18:58.869
But, Mother, I really want this to work.

18:59.037 --> 19:01.665
I want it to work too.

19:01.874 --> 19:04.172
I'm running out of sons.

19:06.445 --> 19:10.745
But if it's gonna work, Ma,
we've all got to make some adjustments.

19:10.916 --> 19:12.008
Like what?

19:12.184 --> 19:15.347
First, Harriette and I have got to be able
to run our own house.

19:15.954 --> 19:18.422
You gotta retire from being in charge.

19:18.590 --> 19:19.750
You can be an adviser.

19:20.492 --> 19:24.394
Well, I'm a little old
to make a career change, but I can try.

19:24.930 --> 19:26.659
Thank you, Mama.

19:27.399 --> 19:30.698
It would help if you told Edward
you were out of line about his curfew.

19:30.869 --> 19:33.064
Oh, I wasn't out of line about that.

19:33.238 --> 19:36.401
Now, speaking as your adviser...

19:37.709 --> 19:42.043
...if Eddie is to learn responsibility,
you've got to trust him.

You know, maybe you're right, Ma.

I'll go apologize to Harriette.

- Sure.

I appreciate you giving up your room...

responsibility...

to 11.

I can't go to the party.
