00:03.435 --> 00:05.203
Good morning, everybody.

00:05.204 --> 00:08.173
We are now boarding
group three. Group three.

00:08.173 --> 00:11.076
Ellipse Airlines Flight 504 to Beijing.

00:11.077 --> 00:14.045
Group three. That's rows ten through 25.

00:14.046 --> 00:16.866
Please have your tickets ready.

00:16.867 --> 00:18.868
You do not need to show
us your passports again.

00:18.869 --> 00:20.535
Thank you.

00:22.000 --> 00:28.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:48.835 --> 00:49.992
Thank you.

00:51.705 --> 00:52.757
Hi.

00:56.972 --> 00:59.707
_

01:01.710 --> 01:03.482
No, I'm not going.

01:03.803 --> 01:04.896
I'm sorry?

01:07.716 --> 01:10.499
_

01:10.620 --> 01:13.222
No. I'm not going.

01:13.223 --> 01:15.591
I'm not going to China. They'll arrest me.

01:15.592 --> 01:17.359
I want to stay in the United States.

01:17.360 --> 01:18.786
I want political asylum.

01:18.787 --> 01:19.549
_

01:19.550 --> 01:20.849
Is there a problem here?

01:23.277 --> 01:24.550
_

01:24.827 --> 01:26.646
_

01:32.407 --> 01:34.042
Oh, hey. Hey, Russell.

01:34.043 --> 01:36.244
- I have a budget meeting.
- It's just gonna take a sec.

01:36.245 --> 01:38.146
- It's about the Henkashu Islands.
- Remind me.

01:38.147 --> 01:39.648
Four uninhabited rocky outcroppings

01:39.649 --> 01:41.983
- in the East China Sea.
- Right.

01:41.984 --> 01:44.353
China and Japan both claim ownership

01:44.354 --> 01:45.887
in a dispute going back generations,

01:45.888 --> 01:46.888
which picked up steam

01:46.889 --> 01:47.819
once it became clear

01:47.820 --> 01:49.991
that there's natural gas
deposits underneath them.

01:49.992 --> 01:52.314
Two weeks ago, China sent
a reconnaissance plane

01:52.315 --> 01:54.491
over the Islands, Japan scrambled an F-15,

01:54.492 --> 01:56.798
they buzzed each other and the
Japanese pilot had to ditch.

01:56.799 --> 01:59.734
You called an emergency summit
to try to avoid an escalation.

01:59.735 --> 02:01.803
- You read my memo.
- I did.

02:01.804 --> 02:03.405
And you have photographic memory.

02:03.406 --> 02:04.806
- I do.
- That's impressive.

02:04.807 --> 02:05.840
I'm told.

02:05.841 --> 02:08.143
Well, speaking of impressive...

02:08.144 --> 02:09.911
I got both sides to agree

02:09.912 --> 02:11.579
that neither lays claim to the Islands

02:11.580 --> 02:13.236
and they divide the natural resources.

02:13.237 --> 02:15.241
We're still working out some of
the details, but it means that

02:15.242 --> 02:17.723
- by this afternoon we could have a treaty.
- Fine.

02:17.724 --> 02:19.621
I'll have POTUS there
for the signing ceremony.

02:19.622 --> 02:21.790
Fine? My...

02:21.791 --> 02:23.425
Fine? Really?

02:23.426 --> 02:25.960
Because my staff and I have
been up for four days straight

02:25.961 --> 02:26.928
trying to avert

02:26.929 --> 02:28.463
World War III, and that's what

02:28.464 --> 02:30.265
we get? We get "fine"?

02:30.266 --> 02:33.468
It's like... God, I'm so sorry.

02:33.469 --> 02:36.437
I mean, we've... It's been a really...

02:36.438 --> 02:38.506
It's been a really long four days,

02:38.507 --> 02:41.843
and I am totally sleep-deprived

02:41.844 --> 02:43.211
and hopped-up on coffee.

02:43.212 --> 02:45.613
I actually feel sick.

02:45.614 --> 02:48.983
Your predecessor and I
had developed a shorthand.

02:48.984 --> 02:50.385
"Fine"...

02:50.386 --> 02:52.887
means "thank you for not screwing up."

02:52.888 --> 02:54.555
It's high praise.

02:54.556 --> 02:55.989
Take it.

02:59.658 --> 03:02.096
He's on with the Japanese
going over the wording

03:02.097 --> 03:03.598
for the ceremony.

03:03.599 --> 03:07.635
"While no one would dream of
dividing national sovereignty,

03:07.636 --> 03:08.803
"natural resources,

03:08.804 --> 03:13.807
with mutual cooperation, can be shared."

03:14.542 --> 03:17.678
Was Jackson psyched about the treaty?

03:17.679 --> 03:19.513
Um, not the word he used, but yeah.

03:19.514 --> 03:21.015
Okay, they're okay with the language,

03:21.016 --> 03:22.088
but they have handshake issues.

03:22.089 --> 03:24.185
The-the Japanese want to be
the first to extend their hand.

03:24.186 --> 03:25.642
Get on the phone with the Chinese Ministry,

03:25.643 --> 03:26.887
see if they can live with that.

03:26.888 --> 03:28.322
- Already on it.
- Japan feels that

03:28.323 --> 03:31.025
by extending their hand first
that-that it shows the world

03:31.026 --> 03:33.294
that they're in charge and
aren't cowering to China.

03:33.295 --> 03:36.367
The world? Seriously?
14 guys watch C-SPAN.

03:36.368 --> 03:37.891
Don't tell them that. This is the move

03:37.892 --> 03:39.733
- that's gonna close the deal.
- China can live

03:39.734 --> 03:41.168
with being second on the handshake.

03:41.169 --> 03:44.704
Hang on one second.

03:52.913 --> 03:54.381
We have an agreement!

03:57.585 --> 03:58.552
Great.

03:58.553 --> 04:00.254
Great. Excellent work, everybody.

04:00.255 --> 04:03.190
White House can do the signing today
at 3:00. The unveiling of the late

04:03.191 --> 04:04.801
Secretary Marsh's portrait is at 3:00.

04:04.802 --> 04:06.827
Not anymore. You're gonna
have to move that to tomorrow.

04:06.828 --> 04:07.604
Of course.

04:07.605 --> 04:10.464
Oh, uh, Daisy, put out a
statement. Standard stuff.

04:10.465 --> 04:12.232
"Nations coming together in peace."

04:12.233 --> 04:13.834
That kind of... Listen, I have to go

04:13.835 --> 04:15.168
to my friend's memorial service.

04:15.169 --> 04:16.702
I'll be back by this afternoon.

04:16.704 --> 04:19.039
Okay, have fun.

04:19.040 --> 04:21.408
Oh, God... you're going
to a memorial service.

04:21.409 --> 04:22.409
It's the opposite

04:22.410 --> 04:23.877
of fun. So...

04:23.878 --> 04:25.679
have whatever the opposite of fun is.

04:25.680 --> 04:28.281
Daisy, you're rambling. Don't
do that in the press room.

04:28.282 --> 04:29.883
Yes, Madam Secretary.

04:29.884 --> 04:32.419
How are the remarks
coming for the unveiling?

04:32.420 --> 04:33.653
Uh...

04:33.654 --> 04:35.555
well, I haven't had
much time to work on it,

04:35.556 --> 04:38.657
but I'll whip something up.

04:39.392 --> 04:43.263
For reasons that I never quite understood,

04:43.264 --> 04:45.098
Secretary Marsh plucked you

04:45.099 --> 04:47.634
from a dead-end copy-writing job.

04:47.635 --> 04:49.736
I argued for a woman from Harvard

04:49.737 --> 04:52.272
with actual speech-writing experience.

04:52.273 --> 04:53.807
And now you're going

04:53.808 --> 04:56.776
to "whip something up" for this man

04:56.777 --> 04:59.537
to whom you owe your career?

05:03.450 --> 05:05.851
Excuse me.

05:08.788 --> 05:10.623
George Peters

05:10.624 --> 05:12.859
lived a life of devotion, honor

05:12.860 --> 05:15.328
and service to The Company.

05:15.329 --> 05:17.297
When he was brought in to Langley

05:17.298 --> 05:19.465
to join our team of analysts,

05:19.466 --> 05:22.135
he approached that job with
the same degree of courage

05:22.136 --> 05:25.338
and conviction as he had
displayed as an operative.

05:25.339 --> 05:27.073
A man of his talents
could have made his mark...

05:27.074 --> 05:29.308
Munsey hardly even knew the guy.

05:29.309 --> 05:31.010
Sat him behind a desk.

05:31.011 --> 05:32.645
For his own safety.

05:32.646 --> 05:35.348
Mm. Still. He irks me.

05:35.349 --> 05:39.085
You know what irks me? His ex-wife

05:39.086 --> 05:41.454
acting like the grieving widow.

05:41.455 --> 05:44.457
She left him for her personal
trainer over a decade ago.

05:44.458 --> 05:47.827
- Oh.
- Hey. Hey.

05:47.828 --> 05:49.328
Are you 12?

05:49.329 --> 05:50.930
Do I need to separate you?

05:50.931 --> 05:54.000
When did Henry become this guy?

05:54.001 --> 05:57.169
He's a Cradle Catholic. He
gets jumpy around priests.

05:57.170 --> 05:59.805
Psst. Hey.

05:59.806 --> 06:01.941
Shh...

06:05.544 --> 06:07.646
What scares people about...

06:07.647 --> 06:09.215
I told you. Look at him.

06:09.216 --> 06:11.984
He turns into an altar boy
right before my eyes. I mean...

06:11.985 --> 06:13.586
No, it's good.

06:13.587 --> 06:15.588
It's comforting to have
something like that.

06:15.589 --> 06:17.022
Me? I'm just gonna have to drink.

06:17.023 --> 06:18.791
Mmm, I'll join you in
that. Anything to knock out

06:18.792 --> 06:20.125
the elephant in the room.

06:20.126 --> 06:22.394
What elephant is that?

06:22.395 --> 06:25.898
She's convinced George's
car crash wasn't an accident.

06:25.899 --> 06:28.267
What? What do you mean?

06:28.268 --> 06:31.503
I don't know. Could have been a suicide.

06:31.504 --> 06:33.238
I mean, the guy was so
angry he'd been moved

06:33.239 --> 06:36.342
to a desk job. I honestly think
it drove him a little crazy.

06:36.343 --> 06:39.211
I just can't believe he'd
do something like that.

06:39.212 --> 06:41.547
Can you?

06:41.548 --> 06:45.117
No, I-I honestly don't
know what to think anymore.

06:45.118 --> 06:47.052
Hey, let's get together soon,

06:47.053 --> 06:49.054
get drunk, tell funny George stories.

06:49.055 --> 06:51.799
Sure. I would do that. Bye.

06:51.800 --> 06:53.917
- Bye.
- Bye.

06:55.794 --> 06:58.463
Isabelle thinks George
had gone a little crazy.

06:58.464 --> 07:00.632
George? Come on.

07:00.633 --> 07:03.368
He thought my predecessor was murdered

07:03.369 --> 07:05.870
and that I might be in danger.

07:06.838 --> 07:09.808
Well, it would be nice to
think that's crazy talk.

07:11.344 --> 07:15.981
The night he died, I said
his death wasn't an accident

07:15.982 --> 07:18.483
and you said, "I know."

07:18.484 --> 07:20.884
What did you mean?

07:22.287 --> 07:24.688
What did you mean?

07:26.024 --> 07:29.426
Maybe we were both just in shock.

07:30.028 --> 07:32.030
Do you want to do this?

07:32.031 --> 07:35.233
Do you want to have this conversation? Now?

07:35.234 --> 07:37.435
'Cause I've been waiting till you're ready.

07:37.436 --> 07:39.404
I can't go there.

07:39.405 --> 07:43.408
I've got the peace treaty signing, and...

07:43.409 --> 07:46.911
I've-I've been gone all week.
I haven't even been home.

07:46.912 --> 07:49.481
I feel like I don't even know what's
going on. How's the speech coming?

07:49.482 --> 07:52.117
Oh, it's a mess right
now, but it'll get there.

07:52.118 --> 07:54.152
It will. How are the kids?

07:54.153 --> 07:55.587
Uh, oh,

07:55.588 --> 07:56.921
Alison wants to have a
sleepover this weekend.

07:56.922 --> 07:58.790
Nothing crazy. Just five or six friends.

07:58.791 --> 08:00.726
- Five or six friends? Since when?
- Yeah.

08:00.727 --> 08:02.676
- When did she have five or six...
- Well, she's got 'em. Um...

08:02.677 --> 08:04.820
- I have been gone a long time.
- I... Do I say yes?

08:04.821 --> 08:07.065
- Absolutely.
- Good. 'Cause I said yes.

08:07.066 --> 08:10.034
Nature abhors a vacuum.

08:10.035 --> 08:12.370
You know what,

08:12.371 --> 08:14.972
I'll have a signed treaty

08:14.973 --> 08:18.309
and you will be finished
with your conference.

08:18.310 --> 08:20.244
I can't breathe.

08:20.245 --> 08:22.246
And then we'll both be home all weekend.

08:22.247 --> 08:24.148
Just like a normal family.

08:24.149 --> 08:26.117
Mmm.

08:26.118 --> 08:28.653
All right. Catch you later.

08:28.654 --> 08:30.454
Ow.

08:31.822 --> 08:34.657
She's all yours, Frank.

08:43.433 --> 08:45.569
Madam Secretary.

08:45.570 --> 08:47.992
Congratulations on averting World War III.

08:47.993 --> 08:49.378
Is that what I did, Senator Fletcher?

08:49.379 --> 08:50.158
Oh, my.

08:50.159 --> 08:52.676
I thought I just brokered
a mineral rights deal

08:52.677 --> 08:55.079
on some tiny islands in the East China Sea.

08:55.080 --> 08:58.349
Oh, now.

08:58.350 --> 09:00.417
- And it feels good.
- Why does Daisy have on a weird face?

09:00.418 --> 09:02.920
- That's just her face.
- No, that's her freaked-out face.

09:02.921 --> 09:04.255
Can I show you something?

09:04.256 --> 09:05.456
Over here?

09:05.457 --> 09:06.690
There's some debate about whether or not

09:06.691 --> 09:08.626
you have on your freaked-out
face or your regular face.

09:08.627 --> 09:11.061
Fu Xinpei, visiting
Chinese high school genius,

09:11.062 --> 09:12.129
just stood up at Dulles

09:12.130 --> 09:14.665
and declared she wants political asylum.

09:14.666 --> 09:18.502
Now Fox News has got hold of her.

09:18.503 --> 09:19.837
I'm worried that she's
gonna mess up the signing

09:19.838 --> 09:21.305
of the treaty, but I'm
probably being paranoid.

09:21.306 --> 09:23.841
This is my paranoid face.

09:23.842 --> 09:27.211
I tried to organize a protest in my village

09:27.212 --> 09:29.613
on the 25th anniversary
of Tiananmen Square.

09:29.614 --> 09:33.851
I was detained and my Internet
postings were deleted...

09:33.852 --> 09:35.885
I'm being paranoid, right?

09:36.520 --> 09:37.921
Is Chen here?

09:37.922 --> 09:39.022
Yes.

09:39.023 --> 09:41.143
You're being paranoid.

09:42.159 --> 09:45.162
Minister Shimabukura,

09:45.163 --> 09:48.265
I just wanted to thank you
for all of your very hard work.

09:48.266 --> 09:50.667
The people of Japan are happy to have come

09:50.668 --> 09:52.736
- to a resolution.
- POTUS, two minutes out.

09:52.737 --> 09:55.338
Okay. See you in a moment.

09:55.339 --> 09:56.440
Minister Chen.

09:56.441 --> 09:57.708
The president will make a few remarks

09:57.709 --> 10:00.043
and then you'll both sign the treaty.

10:00.044 --> 10:01.678
If you return the girl.

10:01.679 --> 10:03.046
Excuse me?

10:03.047 --> 10:05.015
Fu Xinpei.

10:05.016 --> 10:06.616
My staff just briefed me.

10:06.617 --> 10:08.218
Her claims are outrageous.

10:08.219 --> 10:10.053
No one wants to harm her.

10:10.054 --> 10:12.022
She's already been offered a scholarship

10:12.023 --> 10:14.658
- to Beijing Technical Institute.
- Well, her case just needs to go

10:14.659 --> 10:15.926
- through the proper channels.
- She's lying

10:15.927 --> 10:17.327
to America on television.

10:17.328 --> 10:18.762
This is a great embarrassment

10:18.763 --> 10:20.930
- to China.
- POTUS,

10:20.931 --> 10:22.565
- one minute out.
- Let's take our places.

10:22.566 --> 10:24.801
We need to go sign the treaty.

10:24.802 --> 10:26.501
Promise to return the girl.

10:27.170 --> 10:29.671
I can't make that promise.

10:31.741 --> 10:32.947
_

10:33.576 --> 10:35.310
Sir.

10:36.212 --> 10:38.303
Fu Xinpei has nothing to do with this.

10:38.304 --> 10:39.749
If you can't make me this promise,

10:39.750 --> 10:41.870
we have nothing further to discuss.

10:45.913 --> 10:47.266
_

10:48.124 --> 10:49.592
POTUS is in the building.

Sync and corrections by awaqeded
- www.addic7ed.com -

11:06.462 --> 11:08.810
Now I know it's not fashionable anymore,

11:08.811 --> 11:11.446
but I believe we are a beacon of hope

11:11.447 --> 11:14.736
to all the freedom-loving
people all over the world.

11:14.737 --> 11:16.937
And if we send this girl back to China...

11:16.938 --> 11:18.739
if we turn our backs on her...

11:18.740 --> 11:22.275
Every redneck senator is on TV

11:22.276 --> 11:24.511
talking about the evils of the Chinese

11:24.512 --> 11:26.513
instead of here passing a budget.

11:26.514 --> 11:28.248
Where are you on this?

11:28.249 --> 11:31.618
I'm getting enormous pressure
from China to send her back.

11:31.619 --> 11:33.487
If you don't?

11:33.488 --> 11:35.111
Worst-case scenario?

11:35.112 --> 11:36.579
They refuse to sign the treaty,

11:36.580 --> 11:38.581
Japan and China go to war over the Islands,

11:38.582 --> 11:40.183
and since we're Japan's ally,

11:40.184 --> 11:41.684
we're basically at war with China.

11:41.685 --> 11:43.286
When I ask for the worst-case scenario,

11:43.287 --> 11:45.622
what I mean is give me
the best-case scenario

11:45.623 --> 11:46.990
and be sure to make it happen.

11:46.991 --> 11:48.858
Another shorthand you had with Marsh?

11:48.859 --> 11:51.728
Can't have this girl
hijack these budget talks.

11:51.729 --> 11:55.131
And I won't have her be a political pawn

11:55.132 --> 11:57.800
in the Henkashu Islands dispute.

11:57.801 --> 12:00.369
Her case needs to be
judged on its own merits.

12:00.370 --> 12:02.338
Well, handle it personally.

12:02.339 --> 12:03.639
Do it fast.

12:03.640 --> 12:06.409
Okay, but if we grant asylum for the girl,

12:06.410 --> 12:08.044
I may need an inducement for China

12:08.045 --> 12:09.245
to get the treaty done.

12:09.246 --> 12:11.047
China never wanted to sign that treaty.

12:11.048 --> 12:12.815
They were always looking for a way out.

12:12.816 --> 12:13.950
Well, it's

12:13.951 --> 12:16.052
- gonna have to be something good.
- Okay.

12:16.053 --> 12:18.987
See what your people can come up with.

12:20.589 --> 12:22.758
Do you have family there?

12:22.759 --> 12:24.026
Do they know that you're here?

12:24.027 --> 12:25.928
Just-Just my mother and... No.

12:25.929 --> 12:28.097
- Miss, could you tell us...
- Miss, one question here.

12:28.098 --> 12:31.667
But she understands my anger
at the Chinese government.

12:31.668 --> 12:33.369
She had to give up a child...

12:33.370 --> 12:34.804
my younger sister...

12:34.805 --> 12:37.239
due to the one-child policy.

12:37.240 --> 12:39.308
They keep playing the same news clip.

12:39.309 --> 12:41.310
Must be a slow news day.

12:41.311 --> 12:43.212
Wonder if Mom's gonna send her back.

12:43.213 --> 12:45.381
Mom's not making the decision personally.

12:45.382 --> 12:48.284
Yeah, she is. Because of the treaty.

12:48.285 --> 12:51.752
The Henkashu treaty that
the Chinese won't sign?

12:52.821 --> 12:54.290
Dude, do you live on Earth?

12:54.291 --> 12:56.959
Okay, hey, listen to this. Thomas Aquinas

12:56.960 --> 12:59.395
- walks into a bar.
- Oh, um, I need to borrow some, um,

12:59.396 --> 13:01.230
some lunch money. Can-Can
I get some from your wallet?

13:01.231 --> 13:02.631
Yeah, just listen to this joke first.

13:02.632 --> 13:03.866
- What's the joke for?
- He's doing

13:03.867 --> 13:05.843
the keynote speech for a
bunch of religious scholars.

13:05.844 --> 13:08.103
Mom just texted.

13:08.104 --> 13:11.340
She said that you're not sure
if the opening joke is funny.

13:11.341 --> 13:13.375
She said that we should
laugh no matter what.

13:13.376 --> 13:15.911
I don't want your pity laughter.

13:17.280 --> 13:18.881
Yeah?

13:18.882 --> 13:21.316
Morning. I just came to
get a change of clothes

13:21.317 --> 13:23.151
for the secretary. She
pulled another all-nighter

13:23.152 --> 13:24.686
trying to calm down the Japanese.

13:24.687 --> 13:26.922
Oh, and while I'm here,
can I get that guest list

13:26.923 --> 13:29.424
for your sleepover? We
just need to do a quick vet.

13:29.425 --> 13:30.993
Why? My friends aren't terrorists.

13:30.994 --> 13:32.828
Don't be an idiot, Alison.

13:32.829 --> 13:34.162
- It's for their parents.
- I swear

13:34.163 --> 13:36.092
- to God, if you call me an idiot
- If they...

13:36.093 --> 13:37.933
- one more time...
- Could you not call her an idiot?

13:37.934 --> 13:40.569
I'm sick of it. Just go apologize, please.

13:40.570 --> 13:42.904
I'll go and get some clothes for Mom.

13:42.905 --> 13:44.739
Thanks.

13:44.740 --> 13:46.908
Can I go wait for the bus, or do you

13:46.909 --> 13:48.877
want me to listen to your joke?

13:48.878 --> 13:49.978
Get out of here.

13:49.979 --> 13:51.513
All right.

13:51.514 --> 13:53.847
What joke?

13:55.750 --> 13:57.752
Thomas Aquinas walks into a bar.

13:57.753 --> 13:59.154
Please don't go back to Tokyo yet.

13:59.155 --> 14:00.588
Give Minister Chen at least 48 hours.

14:00.589 --> 14:03.191
- I gave the man four days.
- It's just a bump in the road.

14:03.192 --> 14:05.260
- I can get him back to the table.
- We are no longer

14:05.261 --> 14:07.028
- interested in a treaty.
- I...

14:07.029 --> 14:08.663
The Islands are ours and we are

14:08.664 --> 14:10.965
- going to proceed accordingly.
- Give me

14:10.966 --> 14:12.471
48 hours to make it right.

14:12.472 --> 14:14.536
She promised me she wasn't
gonna sound desperate.

14:14.537 --> 14:16.292
She doesn't sound desperate.
She sounds forceful.

14:16.293 --> 14:17.138
What about...

14:17.139 --> 14:19.641
What about tickets to a
baseball game or the theater?

14:19.642 --> 14:20.975
The Book of Mormon's in town.

14:20.976 --> 14:22.577
- Okay, now she sounds desperate.
- Tell us

14:22.578 --> 14:26.147
what you like. Let my office
arrange something for you.

14:26.148 --> 14:27.882
I would like an ally.

14:27.883 --> 14:29.450
I would like you and your president

14:29.451 --> 14:31.185
to back our claim for the Islands.

14:31.186 --> 14:32.387
- Publicly.
- That would be

14:32.388 --> 14:34.322
like declaring war on China.

14:34.323 --> 14:35.956
So be it.

14:39.460 --> 14:41.629
We are your ally.

14:41.630 --> 14:43.765
And I'm playing the ally card.

14:43.766 --> 14:46.433
48 hours.

14:48.636 --> 14:50.138
Fine.

14:50.139 --> 14:52.140
But if you don't get us a deal by then,

14:52.141 --> 14:56.576
we're planting a Japanese
flag on those Islands.

14:59.881 --> 15:01.782
I need ideas for inducements for China

15:01.783 --> 15:04.118
- in case we grant Xinpei asylum.
- I'll call the China desk.

15:04.119 --> 15:06.554
- Did we hear back from Beijing Institute?
- Yes.

15:06.555 --> 15:08.389
Xinpei was offered a scholarship.

15:08.390 --> 15:09.690
So that checks out.

15:09.691 --> 15:12.126
I want the exact language
from the INS statute.

15:12.127 --> 15:13.527
Already done.

15:13.528 --> 15:15.262
"To qualify for political asylum,

15:15.263 --> 15:17.531
"the candidate must demonstrate
that they have been persecuted

15:17.532 --> 15:19.500
"in the past or have a well-founded fear

15:19.501 --> 15:21.635
"that they will be
persecuted if they go back

15:21.636 --> 15:23.237
to their home country."

15:23.238 --> 15:24.338
Matt,

15:24.339 --> 15:25.806
go through Xinpei's blog posts.

15:25.807 --> 15:28.075
You know what, hell, go through
her entire online history

15:28.076 --> 15:30.111
and flag anything that's
even vaguely political.

15:30.112 --> 15:32.746
Oh, Daisy can do that. Matt has to write

15:32.747 --> 15:34.014
Marsh's remarks.

15:35.283 --> 15:37.651
Fine.

15:37.652 --> 15:39.420
How are they coming?

15:39.421 --> 15:42.189
It's good. Al... I mean, almost done.

15:42.190 --> 15:44.390
I look forward to reading them.

15:47.194 --> 15:48.462
She hates me.

15:48.463 --> 15:49.830
She hates everyone.

15:49.831 --> 15:51.731
Mostly me.

15:54.568 --> 15:57.337
This is your room.

15:57.338 --> 15:58.772
There's a TV in the living room.

15:58.773 --> 16:00.741
If you want to watch
something, let me know.

16:00.742 --> 16:02.075
I have a bunch of movies.

16:02.076 --> 16:04.311
Thank you.

16:04.312 --> 16:05.579
Are you hungry?

16:05.580 --> 16:07.247
I was just going to make some lunch.

16:07.248 --> 16:09.748
No, thank you. I think I'll rest.

16:13.787 --> 16:15.754
Have you spoken to your mother?

16:18.225 --> 16:19.426
No.

16:19.427 --> 16:20.560
She said they would be

16:20.561 --> 16:23.663
monitoring my phone and
it would not be safe.

16:23.664 --> 16:27.866
So she knew you were going to do this?

16:31.338 --> 16:34.573
Well, I'll let you get some rest.

17:19.727 --> 17:21.362
_

17:29.377 --> 17:30.550
_

17:32.171 --> 17:35.528
_

17:36.698 --> 17:37.498
_

17:43.802 --> 17:46.849
_

17:52.318 --> 17:53.786
Madam Secretary, I'm sorry

17:53.787 --> 17:56.055
- to interrupt.
- Did you hear back from the China desk?

17:56.056 --> 17:57.990
Uh, yes.

17:57.991 --> 18:01.030
We're holding a Chinese spy that
Beijing very much wants back.

18:01.031 --> 18:02.611
Oh, good. Run it by the White House,

18:02.612 --> 18:03.996
- will you? Oh, and, uh,
- Yes, ma'am...

18:03.997 --> 18:05.331
Arrange an interview with Xinpei.

18:05.332 --> 18:06.398
Yes. Uh, there's

18:06.399 --> 18:07.933
a woman here. She's from Michigan.

18:07.934 --> 18:10.135
She and her daughter drove
all night to get here.

18:10.136 --> 18:11.504
I've spoken with her, and

18:11.505 --> 18:14.205
I think you should meet them.

18:15.007 --> 18:17.209
She's offered to be Xinpei's guardian

18:17.210 --> 18:19.311
- while the case is being decided.
- But she's already staying

18:19.312 --> 18:21.614
- with an asylum officer assigned by INS.
- I know.

18:21.615 --> 18:23.749
- So why am I... Hi.
- Madam Secretary.

18:23.750 --> 18:25.684
- Hi. Amy Ferber.
- Nice to meet you.

18:25.685 --> 18:27.453
Thank you very much for meeting with us.

18:27.454 --> 18:29.421
Well, I'm sorry that you
had to drive all night

18:29.422 --> 18:31.590
- to get here.
- Oh, we had to.

18:31.591 --> 18:34.259
As soon as I heard Xinpei's story,

18:34.260 --> 18:36.762
the-the province that she's from.

18:36.763 --> 18:38.664
And then I saw her face on TV...

18:38.665 --> 18:40.232
I-I started shaking.

18:40.233 --> 18:42.601
The resemblance is undeniable.

18:42.602 --> 18:44.636
See for yourself.

18:44.637 --> 18:46.504
Emily?

18:48.941 --> 18:50.142
Hi.

18:50.143 --> 18:51.877
Hi.

18:51.878 --> 18:53.912
Nice to meet you.

18:53.913 --> 18:56.847
I think Emily and Xinpei might be sisters.

19:07.064 --> 19:10.416
Emily's orphanage was in
Xinpei's hometown. I'm seriously

19:10.417 --> 19:11.650
getting goose bumps, you guys.

19:11.651 --> 19:13.719
They're swabbing Emily's cheek.

19:13.720 --> 19:15.153
Now they're done swabbing Emily's cheek.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.421
Ooh.

19:16.422 --> 19:18.323
Okay, now Madam Secretary
is walking towards the door.

19:18.324 --> 19:19.457
Crap.

19:19.559 --> 19:20.706
Crap.

19:23.729 --> 19:25.697
Did you found anything
else on Xinpei's blog?

19:25.698 --> 19:28.200
Three months ago she started criticizing

19:28.201 --> 19:29.601
China's human rights record,

19:29.602 --> 19:32.204
their policy on Tibet.
Before that it was mostly

19:32.205 --> 19:33.872
about her science projects
and her basketball team.

19:33.873 --> 19:36.041
And One Direction.

19:36.042 --> 19:38.410
Oh, uh, thanks. This is Emily's DNA.

19:38.411 --> 19:40.812
Send it to the lab. How
quickly can we get it here?

19:40.813 --> 19:42.414
Uh, preliminaries in less than four hours.

19:42.415 --> 19:43.415
Yeah, this is so cool.

19:43.416 --> 19:44.816
So cool.

19:44.817 --> 19:47.585
Okay, guys, wait. I-I get
that this is exciting, okay?

19:47.586 --> 19:50.088
But let's not lose our heads and remember

19:50.089 --> 19:52.657
the job at hand: to determine
whether or not Xinpei

19:52.658 --> 19:54.993
meets the criteria for political asylum.

19:54.994 --> 19:56.394
Ma'am, your car's here.

19:56.395 --> 19:58.830
- Thank you.
- Do you want me to put out a statement?

19:58.831 --> 20:01.199
Saying Xinpei might have a sister?

20:01.200 --> 20:03.468
So that all of D.C. can
stop what they're doing

20:03.469 --> 20:06.171
the same way they do every
time Mei Xiang goes into labor?

20:06.172 --> 20:07.419
Sorry, who's Mei Xiang?

20:07.420 --> 20:09.307
Uh, the panda at the National Zoo?

20:09.308 --> 20:11.109
Gave birth to Bao Bao in 2013?

20:11.110 --> 20:13.244
- I don't get to the zoo much.
- You don't have to.

20:13.245 --> 20:15.613
They have a giant panda
cam on her all the time.

20:15.614 --> 20:18.082
- You're kidding.
- Not kidding. It's awesome.

20:18.083 --> 20:19.617
- Come here, I'll show you.
- Matt.

20:19.618 --> 20:22.819
After I finish these Marsh remarks.

20:23.855 --> 20:25.623
Madam Secretary.

20:25.624 --> 20:26.891
How's she doing?

20:26.892 --> 20:29.460
Honestly? She seems scared to death.

20:29.461 --> 20:33.064
If my daughter was requesting
asylum in a strange country, I'd

20:33.065 --> 20:35.566
hope she'd have the good sense
to be scared to death, too.

20:35.567 --> 20:38.402
I-I know I'm not supposed to ask,

20:38.403 --> 20:39.971
but are you going to grant asylum?

20:39.972 --> 20:42.972
You're right. You're not supposed to ask.

20:44.475 --> 20:45.977
Anyway, she's in the back.

20:45.978 --> 20:49.680
Can I get you anything?

20:49.681 --> 20:51.614
Yeah.

20:54.518 --> 20:56.487
So, you've got H,

20:56.488 --> 20:59.122
I've got H-O-R...

20:59.957 --> 21:02.626
...S.

21:02.627 --> 21:05.329
So tell me about your science project.

21:05.330 --> 21:07.031
I developed an eye-tracking system

21:07.032 --> 21:09.733
that allows quadriplegics
to use the computer.

21:09.734 --> 21:12.136
I think we have that technology here.

21:12.137 --> 21:13.437
No, not like mine.

21:13.438 --> 21:15.306
Mine is light-years ahead of what any

21:15.307 --> 21:16.907
major labs in the States have developed.

21:16.908 --> 21:19.610
So, you're moving here to cash in on it?

21:19.611 --> 21:21.946
No, I would never do that.

21:21.947 --> 21:25.314
But by coming here you'd be
giving up your scholarship.

21:26.583 --> 21:29.018
I fear for my safety if I return.

21:31.388 --> 21:32.389
Tell me why.

21:32.390 --> 21:33.624
Have you been arrested?

21:33.625 --> 21:35.059
No.

21:35.060 --> 21:36.193
Threatened?

21:36.194 --> 21:37.761
Censoring my speech is a threat

21:37.762 --> 21:39.196
and I won't accept it any longer.

21:39.197 --> 21:41.131
Oh, lots of Web sites
are censored in China.

21:41.132 --> 21:43.934
I want the freedom to do
as I wish, say what I wish.

21:43.935 --> 21:46.236
I understand how you
feel, but the problem is

21:46.237 --> 21:49.106
it doesn't meet the
standard for persecution.

21:49.107 --> 21:50.173
I'm on your side, Xinpei,

21:50.174 --> 21:52.655
but you got to help me build a case.

21:54.077 --> 21:55.345
I fear for my safety

21:55.346 --> 21:57.214
- if I return to China.
- Right.

21:58.816 --> 22:02.185
Eeh, come on. Oh,

22:02.186 --> 22:05.389
I need a sample of your DNA.

22:05.390 --> 22:07.958
Instructions are in the kit.

22:10.328 --> 22:12.628
Aren't you gonna ask me why?

22:14.865 --> 22:17.067
For someone suspicious of government,

22:17.068 --> 22:19.435
you sure agreed to that quickly.

22:24.841 --> 22:26.843
And now!

22:26.844 --> 22:28.578
- Absolutely. No problem.
- Excuse me.

22:28.579 --> 22:30.080
Are you Stephanie McCord?

22:30.081 --> 22:31.648
I am.

22:31.649 --> 22:33.917
Hello, Senator Fletcher.

22:33.918 --> 22:35.986
I met your mother a few times.

22:35.987 --> 22:37.654
How's she liking her new job?

22:37.655 --> 22:39.356
She loves it.

22:39.357 --> 22:41.024
Ah.

22:41.025 --> 22:43.226
I'm so sorry.

22:43.227 --> 22:45.562
I didn't, um, see your name
on the reservation list.

22:45.563 --> 22:47.130
Are you here to meet someone?

22:47.131 --> 22:49.933
I sure am. You.

22:49.934 --> 22:52.368
- Uh...
- I've been trying to get

22:52.369 --> 22:53.469
your mother on the phone,

22:53.470 --> 22:55.138
but that Nadine is quite the gatekeeper.

22:55.139 --> 22:56.673
I'm not so sure what I...

22:56.674 --> 22:58.541
If you could mention to your mother

22:58.542 --> 23:00.443
how strongly the people of Texas feel

23:00.444 --> 23:04.948
that we not return that
poor little girl to China,

23:04.949 --> 23:08.351
I sure would appreciate it.

23:08.352 --> 23:10.919
Bye now.

23:14.223 --> 23:16.225
This is completely generic.

23:16.226 --> 23:18.261
It's as if you never met the man.

23:18.262 --> 23:20.163
Secretary McCord has never met him.

23:20.164 --> 23:21.831
She has to give the speech.

23:21.832 --> 23:24.767
- That'll be so comforting to his family.
- I forgot to tell you.

23:24.768 --> 23:26.002
The secretary needs to postpone again.

23:26.003 --> 23:27.036
What?

23:27.037 --> 23:28.404
With a clock on the treaty negotiations,

23:28.405 --> 23:29.605
her plate's just too full right now.

23:29.606 --> 23:31.274
To take 15 minutes and pay tribute

23:31.275 --> 23:32.842
to the man who had the job

23:32.843 --> 23:36.379
before her? The man who
died serving his country?

23:36.380 --> 23:38.814
You know what you should
put in those remarks, Matt?

23:38.815 --> 23:41.617
Wherever he went, he had me arrange to have

23:41.618 --> 23:43.819
a hundred soccer balls shipped there.

23:43.820 --> 23:45.821
We'd be driving through a town,

23:45.822 --> 23:48.391
and he'd see kids by the side of the road,

23:48.392 --> 23:50.760
stop the convoy and hand out a soccer ball.

23:50.761 --> 23:56.365
Kids who grew up in poverty
and war-torn areas suddenly

23:56.366 --> 23:58.234
were smiling.

23:58.235 --> 24:00.736
He told the journalists
not to write about it

24:00.737 --> 24:02.972
because he didn't want the attention.

24:02.973 --> 24:06.141
He said this job wasn't about him.

24:06.142 --> 24:07.977
Well, you know what?

24:07.978 --> 24:10.980
Now it is about him.

24:10.981 --> 24:13.916
And we need to stop putting it off

24:13.917 --> 24:17.919
and take the time and say thank you.

24:19.288 --> 24:21.490
You're right. We do.

24:21.491 --> 24:25.860
I want to give the unveiling
the attention it deserves.

24:27.930 --> 24:32.433
Which is why I'm asking to reschedule it.

24:34.136 --> 24:37.738
I'm sorry, ma'am. I can't do that.

24:53.021 --> 24:55.422
How long did you work for him?

24:57.092 --> 25:00.194
Since he was a senator.

25:01.530 --> 25:04.865
I was fresh out of law
school with no experience.

25:07.903 --> 25:10.472
He liked to do that.

25:10.473 --> 25:13.807
Bet on the dark horse.

25:16.778 --> 25:19.447
He sounds like an amazing man.

25:19.448 --> 25:21.950
I know this is hard.

25:21.951 --> 25:23.618
You're all still grieving.

25:23.619 --> 25:26.020
But I got to push this thing.

25:26.021 --> 25:29.824
I don't want it to be something
that we just get through.

25:29.825 --> 25:31.860
Call Mrs. Marsh.

25:31.861 --> 25:34.928
I can't.

25:36.798 --> 25:39.234
It's inappropriate.

25:39.235 --> 25:42.536
You must have heard talk.

25:47.041 --> 25:49.043
Vincent was right.

25:49.044 --> 25:51.012
He said no one suspected.

25:51.013 --> 25:53.214
He said they were all too preoccupied

25:53.215 --> 25:55.582
with their own careers.

25:58.619 --> 26:01.021
Even his wife.

26:02.090 --> 26:04.158
So, you and Marsh were...

26:04.159 --> 26:07.460
Mm-hmm.

26:11.799 --> 26:13.768
I'm so sorry.

26:16.771 --> 26:19.440
I know how all this sounds.

26:20.776 --> 26:23.243
Um...

26:25.513 --> 26:27.882
It sounds like your heart is broken.

26:34.955 --> 26:36.824
Don't. It's not finished yet.

26:36.825 --> 26:40.127
Daisy, will you, uh, call
Secretary Marsh's widow

26:40.128 --> 26:42.229
and apologize for rescheduling again?

26:42.230 --> 26:43.397
Will do.

26:43.398 --> 26:44.832
Just heard from the White House.

26:44.833 --> 26:46.867
ODNI killed our Chinese spy idea.

26:46.868 --> 26:50.137
Okay. We have no plan B?

26:50.138 --> 26:52.139
Wait. So, we don't have any leverage

26:52.140 --> 26:53.607
to get China to sign the treaty?

26:53.608 --> 26:55.943
Well, other than sending Xinpei back...

26:55.944 --> 26:58.479
- Madam Secretary?
- What is it?

26:58.480 --> 27:00.846
DNA results.

27:05.887 --> 27:08.889
Oh, no. I was so sure she was a match.

27:08.890 --> 27:10.991
No, she is.

27:10.992 --> 27:13.494
The preliminary results are a 97% match.

27:13.495 --> 27:14.436
Oh.

27:14.437 --> 27:15.994
That's incredible! The fact that

27:15.995 --> 27:17.237
now she has a blood relative

27:17.238 --> 27:18.242
who's an American citizen.

27:18.243 --> 27:19.240
It is incredible.

27:19.241 --> 27:21.301
Unfortunately, it doesn't
change my decision.

27:21.302 --> 27:22.231
Wait. But it has to.

27:22.232 --> 27:23.949
- I'm denying asylum.
- What?

27:23.950 --> 27:26.422
She's making up the story
about political persecution.

27:26.423 --> 27:28.942
- But she said that China was...
- My guess is, her mother put her up to it.

27:28.943 --> 27:30.944
She has reason to be angry with China.

27:30.945 --> 27:33.013
They made her give up one of her children.

27:33.014 --> 27:35.082
Xinpei has been treated
well by her government,

27:35.083 --> 27:38.185
and they assure me they
will continue to do so.

27:38.186 --> 27:39.500
But her Internet postings have been very

27:39.501 --> 27:41.071
- clear about what she...
- Started three months ago

27:41.072 --> 27:43.123
before she came to America.

27:44.559 --> 27:46.426
Looks like she was building a case.

27:46.427 --> 27:48.261
And frankly, the case

27:48.262 --> 27:49.396
just isn't there.

27:49.397 --> 27:51.464
And this has nothing to do with finding out

27:51.465 --> 27:53.567
we have no plan B on the Henkashu talks?

27:53.568 --> 27:56.069
I refuse to link that little girl's fate

27:56.070 --> 27:57.671
to the fate of those talks.

27:57.672 --> 27:59.105
But they are linked. You know they are.

27:59.106 --> 28:00.140
- And pretending...
- Daisy...

28:00.141 --> 28:01.941
Look, I'm the one who has to stand

28:01.942 --> 28:03.843
in front of the press and assure them

28:03.844 --> 28:05.879
that Xinpei isn't being
used as a political football

28:05.880 --> 28:06.813
to get the treaty signed.

28:06.814 --> 28:08.481
I'd like to be telling the truth.

28:08.482 --> 28:09.883
Were you in the habit

28:09.884 --> 28:12.924
- of questioning Secretary Marsh's ethics?
- He...

28:13.019 --> 28:16.989
He never made me feel like I had to.

28:20.928 --> 28:24.163
Reach out to Xinpei's mother in China,

28:24.164 --> 28:25.899
and get Xinpei on the phone.

28:25.900 --> 28:27.934
I want them both on the line

28:27.935 --> 28:30.802
when I explain why I am denying asylum.

28:34.207 --> 28:36.676
Am I a monster?

28:36.677 --> 28:37.744
I need you to be honest.

28:37.745 --> 28:39.245
Well, sometimes you have kind of a

28:39.246 --> 28:41.147
zombie thing going on in the morning.

28:41.148 --> 28:43.449
Come on, I'm serious.

28:43.450 --> 28:45.551
My staff thinks I don't have any feelings.

28:45.552 --> 28:49.155
A woman left a baby outside
at an orphanage, and a half

28:49.156 --> 28:52.124
a world away that baby is
reunited with her sister?

28:52.125 --> 28:55.862
And it's-it's miraculous,
and I'm thrilled for them,

28:55.863 --> 28:57.563
and sad that they missed 11 years together.

28:58.932 --> 29:01.367
And I'm angry at the government
that forced them apart.

29:01.368 --> 29:03.703
I'm nothing but feelings.

29:03.704 --> 29:05.171
But that doesn't change the fact

29:05.172 --> 29:08.174
that she does not qualify
for political asylum.

29:08.175 --> 29:11.276
What is that noise? Are you making popcorn?

29:11.944 --> 29:13.579
Son of a bitch!

29:13.580 --> 29:15.481
Oh, God, it's the sleepover tonight.

29:15.482 --> 29:17.283
I am not home for my daughter's

29:17.284 --> 29:19.218
sleepover with five or six friends

29:19.219 --> 29:21.187
whose names I don't even know
because my staff is right.

29:21.188 --> 29:22.388
I'm a monster.

29:22.389 --> 29:23.489
Yeah, and it gets worse.

29:23.490 --> 29:25.524
You're raising little monsters.

29:25.525 --> 29:27.860
'Cause it turns out that
the number one indicator

29:27.861 --> 29:29.895
that a person turns into a serial killer

29:29.896 --> 29:31.997
is that, during childhood, the father,

29:31.998 --> 29:35.234
not the mother, made the
popcorn for the sleepover.

29:35.235 --> 29:36.568
All right, now you're just mocking me.

29:36.569 --> 29:39.471
You're a mom who had to stay late at work.

29:39.472 --> 29:40.572
It doesn't ruin the kids.

29:40.573 --> 29:42.074
It just shows them that sometimes

29:42.075 --> 29:43.709
you have to do stuff that's hard.

29:43.710 --> 29:45.444
It's just life, babe. Normal life.

29:45.445 --> 29:47.379
Your a mom that got stuck at work.

29:47.380 --> 29:49.248
Thank you.

29:49.249 --> 29:51.183
That makes sense. I'm buying it.

29:51.184 --> 29:52.384
Good.

29:52.385 --> 29:53.719
I love you.

29:53.720 --> 29:55.854
While you're in that space,
you want to hear a joke?

29:55.855 --> 29:56.955
Yeah.

29:56.956 --> 29:59.291
Thomas Aquinas walks into a bar.

29:59.292 --> 30:01.426
There's the pope sitting
there with no clothes on.

30:01.427 --> 30:04.630
He talking to the bartender...

30:04.631 --> 30:07.866
God, please don't tell
me you actually used that

30:07.867 --> 30:10.269
- in your speech.
- Well...

30:10.270 --> 30:11.803
Madam Secretary?

30:11.804 --> 30:14.172
Hold on a second. What?

30:14.173 --> 30:16.942
Xinpei's mother was
taken in for questioning

30:16.943 --> 30:18.076
by the Chinese Secret Police

30:18.077 --> 30:20.245
yesterday. We're getting reports

30:20.246 --> 30:22.280
that she died while in custody.

30:26.018 --> 30:27.751
Babe, is everything all right?

30:29.421 --> 30:33.061
No. No.

30:36.692 --> 30:37.860
What the hell happened?

30:37.861 --> 30:40.696
Madam Secretary, if we
could keep this cordial.

30:40.697 --> 30:43.465
You do realize that by killing this woman

30:43.466 --> 30:46.568
you've made Xinpei's case for
asylum that much harder to deny.

30:46.569 --> 30:48.370
Fu Xinwan was brought in for questioning.

30:48.371 --> 30:50.439
It was an interview, not an interrogation.

30:50.440 --> 30:52.274
She had a heart attack.

30:52.275 --> 30:55.044
It is my understanding
this was a chronic condition

30:55.045 --> 30:56.712
that she wasn't managing well.

30:56.713 --> 30:58.280
She was rushed to the hospital,

30:58.281 --> 31:00.249
but the doctors were
not able to resuscitate.

31:00.250 --> 31:02.817
Now, why should I believe you?

31:02.818 --> 31:04.753
Madam...

31:04.754 --> 31:07.055
I am a father.

31:07.056 --> 31:10.392
I feel terribly for this poor girl.

31:10.393 --> 31:11.994
China is changing.

31:11.995 --> 31:14.029
In today's China, the sins of the parents

31:14.030 --> 31:15.497
don't transfer to their children.

31:15.498 --> 31:17.566
Fu Xinpei has nothing to fear from us.

31:17.567 --> 31:19.601
You must let her come home.

31:19.602 --> 31:22.337
My government believes

31:22.338 --> 31:25.440
you never planned on
signing the Henkashu Treaty.

31:25.441 --> 31:27.509
You were always just looking for a way out.

31:27.510 --> 31:30.077
And this girl was a convenient excuse.

31:32.981 --> 31:35.550
Unless the girl is returned
in the next 12 hours,

31:35.551 --> 31:37.752
- Come on.
- my government will have no choice

31:37.753 --> 31:40.522
but to permanently walk
away from these talks.

31:40.523 --> 31:42.824
We are already moving ballistic missiles

31:42.825 --> 31:44.226
to our southeastern coast,

31:44.227 --> 31:46.428
just in case the Japanese decide

31:46.429 --> 31:50.097
to do anything stupid like plant
a flag on the Henkashu Islands.

32:08.117 --> 32:12.587
She finds a sister, and
now we have to tell her

32:12.588 --> 32:14.255
she lost her mom.

32:14.256 --> 32:16.157
It's not fair.

32:16.158 --> 32:19.459
No, it isn't.

32:20.461 --> 32:24.699
Let's... Let's just
give her another minute.

32:24.700 --> 32:26.367
Ah! Ah!

32:30.506 --> 32:32.473
I'm sorry about before.

32:32.474 --> 32:35.141
It was unprofessional.

32:39.147 --> 32:41.315
I was jealous, actually.

32:41.316 --> 32:45.051
A friend of mine recently died, too,

32:46.709 --> 32:48.488
and...

32:49.720 --> 32:51.791
I haven't been able to cry.

32:56.998 --> 33:01.335
I started this job, and
I had a lot on my mind.

33:01.336 --> 33:05.838
Today I realized I could use a good cry.

33:08.876 --> 33:11.244
You should have one.

33:20.454 --> 33:24.056
Oh, this isn't gonna get any easier.

33:29.763 --> 33:33.901
So, I got freaking accosted

33:33.902 --> 33:35.511
today at work about the Chinese kid.

33:35.512 --> 33:37.305
- That senator from Texas?
- Fletcher?

33:37.306 --> 33:38.739
She comes up to me, and she's, like,

33:38.740 --> 33:40.541
"If y'all could let your mama know

33:40.542 --> 33:43.577
that the good people
of Texas hate commies."

33:43.578 --> 33:45.145
Senator Fletcher is

33:45.146 --> 33:47.181
actually awesome. She's a family friend.

33:47.182 --> 33:49.416
She may be awesome, but her
politics are really not awesome.

33:49.417 --> 33:51.051
She has no idea what she's talking about.

33:51.052 --> 33:53.954
Um, she's actually really
smart. She went to Stanford.

33:53.955 --> 33:55.989
Oh, really?

33:55.990 --> 33:58.825
So that makes everything
that she says okay?

33:58.826 --> 34:00.093
- All right, Stevie.
- I didn't say that.

34:00.094 --> 34:01.828
What? I mean, yes, China
is a Communist society,

34:01.829 --> 34:03.630
but you can't just paint it
with this broad, evil brush.

34:03.631 --> 34:05.899
- Okay, I wasn't even talking about that.
- I mean, Americans have this...

34:05.900 --> 34:07.067
- Just ignore her.
- Yeah, that's great.

34:07.068 --> 34:09.402
Just watch TV and be dumb and complacent.

34:09.404 --> 34:11.454
No. You don't get to call me dumb anymore.

34:11.455 --> 34:12.531
Okay, come on. Come on, the two of you.

34:12.532 --> 34:13.739
Okay, well, then, prove
to me that you're not.

34:13.741 --> 34:16.012
- No. You are the idiot now.
- Now you're just trying to look cool

34:16.013 --> 34:17.891
- in front of your friends.
- I'm trying to look cool?

34:17.893 --> 34:18.606
Whatever!

34:18.607 --> 34:20.514
You're not the best at everything anymore.

34:20.514 --> 34:22.516
You're not the valedictorian,
homecoming queen.

34:22.516 --> 34:24.150
You're a hostess in a restaurant

34:24.150 --> 34:26.219
showing people to their tables.

34:26.219 --> 34:28.420
That's what you are.

34:34.293 --> 34:36.295
Thanks, Dad.

34:42.639 --> 34:44.203
She was in heart failure

34:44.204 --> 34:45.304
when I left.

34:45.306 --> 34:47.741
The doctor said that

34:47.742 --> 34:49.775
she needed surgery, but...

34:49.777 --> 34:52.078
she refused.

34:54.315 --> 34:56.681
I found this.

35:01.221 --> 35:03.222
Minister Chen said something

35:03.223 --> 35:07.160
about not punishing children
for their parents' sins.

35:07.161 --> 35:09.195
And it hit me.

35:09.196 --> 35:11.431
She was the activist, not you.

35:12.700 --> 35:14.901
Coming here was her idea.

35:14.902 --> 35:17.769
This was her dream.

35:22.243 --> 35:23.976
She couldn't have freedom,

35:23.977 --> 35:26.578
so she wanted it for you?

35:29.615 --> 35:32.151
She kept saying,

35:32.152 --> 35:34.787
"Be strong, Xinpei.

35:34.788 --> 35:38.658
"Be strong.

35:38.659 --> 35:41.059
You can do this."

35:47.533 --> 35:52.204
Because she died in custody,

35:52.205 --> 35:54.974
that qualifies you for political asylum.

35:54.975 --> 35:57.975
You can stay in America if you want.

35:58.677 --> 36:01.546
If that's what you want.

36:02.648 --> 36:05.149
Is it?

36:21.196 --> 36:22.929
Xinpei wants to stay.

36:23.163 --> 36:24.630
Madam Secretary...

36:24.631 --> 36:27.667
I'm leaning towards denying asylum.

36:27.668 --> 36:29.635
Excellent decision.

36:29.636 --> 36:33.439
I hate being lied to,
especially by a child.

36:33.440 --> 36:36.242
And she confirmed her mother's bad health.

36:36.243 --> 36:38.811
- So...
- No one...

36:38.812 --> 36:40.513
...we have an agreement.

36:40.514 --> 36:42.381
...touches her from your side.

36:42.382 --> 36:44.316
No retribution.

36:44.317 --> 36:47.987
She's a confused child,
and her future safety

36:47.988 --> 36:49.755
is paramount to the United States

36:49.756 --> 36:51.624
and our continued goodwill.

36:51.625 --> 36:53.025
You have my word.

36:53.026 --> 36:54.760
But she's not going anywhere

36:54.761 --> 36:58.463
until I have a signed treaty in my hands.

37:11.610 --> 37:15.614
While no one would dream of
dividing national sovereignty,

37:15.615 --> 37:18.183
natural resources, with cooperation,

37:18.184 --> 37:21.619
can be shared.

37:39.938 --> 37:41.974
Daisy.

37:41.975 --> 37:44.142
You used her.

37:44.143 --> 37:45.911
Even though you promised you wouldn't.

37:45.912 --> 37:47.045
She just lost her mother,

37:47.046 --> 37:48.847
and you used her as a bargaining chip.

37:48.848 --> 37:50.248
I don't think I can work for...

37:50.249 --> 37:52.050
Stop before you finish that sentence.

37:52.051 --> 37:54.252
You should know, Xinpei wants to go back.

37:54.253 --> 37:56.254
It's her choice, not mine.

37:56.255 --> 37:58.290
I... I don't understand.

37:58.291 --> 38:00.892
She wants to help build
a more democratic China,

38:00.893 --> 38:03.962
so, she's going back to
continue her mother's work

38:03.963 --> 38:05.964
in her own way.

38:05.965 --> 38:08.767
So, you lied to Minister Chen?

38:08.768 --> 38:11.436
I didn't have a plan B,
and I needed leverage.

38:11.437 --> 38:13.405
So, yes, I lied.

38:13.406 --> 38:14.873
If the Chinese had found out

38:14.874 --> 38:16.408
that Xinpei was returning voluntarily,

38:16.409 --> 38:18.710
they still could have
walked away from the talks.

38:18.711 --> 38:20.712
This way, they saw you as
a strong broker for peace.

38:20.713 --> 38:22.147
And I got to put China on notice

38:22.148 --> 38:23.915
that if Xinpei so much as stubs her toe,

38:23.916 --> 38:25.850
there will be hell to pay.

38:25.851 --> 38:27.719
Hi, guys. Xinpei, I've got

38:27.720 --> 38:29.454
all your papers. Are you ready to go?

38:29.455 --> 38:31.656
- Yup. These guys are gonna take me.
- Oh, good!

38:31.657 --> 38:34.359
Look what my sister gave
me to remember her by.

38:34.360 --> 38:36.094
Oh! That is very cool.

38:36.095 --> 38:37.962
And we're going to visit
Xinpei in China this summer.

38:37.963 --> 38:39.564
Mm-hmm. Come on, come on.

38:39.565 --> 38:41.432
You don't want to miss your plane.

38:41.433 --> 38:45.069
You're not mad at me for
wanting to go back, right?

38:45.070 --> 38:47.305
Of course not. You kidding?

38:47.306 --> 38:48.773
You're honoring your mother.

38:48.774 --> 38:50.608
I think she'd be very proud of you.

38:50.609 --> 38:52.744
Really?

38:52.745 --> 38:54.412
I am sure of it.

38:56.482 --> 38:59.316
You go out there and
change the world, okay?

39:05.790 --> 39:08.158
Go.

39:14.332 --> 39:15.866
He liked to hire

39:15.867 --> 39:18.035
what he referred to as "dark horses"...

39:18.036 --> 39:19.370
people who may not have

39:19.371 --> 39:22.073
gone to the best schools, or
come from the best families,

39:22.074 --> 39:24.008
but who had a fire

39:24.009 --> 39:26.043
in their bellies to make the world better.

39:26.044 --> 39:28.379
I've come to see that he was much more

39:28.380 --> 39:32.283
than just a portrait on the
wall, or a face on the news.

39:32.284 --> 39:37.188
He was a boss, a mentor, a patriot.

39:37.189 --> 39:39.290
He was a great American.

39:39.291 --> 39:41.791
We will miss him.

39:58.742 --> 40:00.484
That was a quite a speech.

40:00.485 --> 40:01.445
Thank you.

40:01.446 --> 40:03.453
I never heard the soccer ball thing before.

40:03.454 --> 40:06.271
- I know. That's a pretty amazing story.
- Yeah, you got to wonder.

40:06.272 --> 40:08.682
He's handing out all these soccer balls,

40:08.683 --> 40:10.839
paying for them out of his own pocket,

40:10.840 --> 40:13.156
and not one bit of press about it.

40:13.157 --> 40:15.559
Well, apparently, he didn't want any.

40:15.560 --> 40:17.761
Yeah. I don't buy it.

40:17.762 --> 40:19.763
I think he made a deal
with all those reporters

40:19.764 --> 40:23.433
to wait, run the story
when he ran against Dalton

40:23.434 --> 40:24.868
in the next election.

40:24.869 --> 40:26.770
- What?
- Oh, yeah.

40:26.771 --> 40:29.573
Bastard was getting ready to
announce right before he died.

40:29.574 --> 40:31.908
Stabbing his own president in the back.

40:31.909 --> 40:34.444
And I will bet you any amount of money

40:34.445 --> 40:37.614
that the next day, there would
have been a picture of him

40:37.615 --> 40:39.449
with a bunch of smiling street kids

40:39.450 --> 40:42.118
and their brand-new soccer balls.

40:42.119 --> 40:43.920
If you'll excuse me.

40:43.921 --> 40:46.722
I have to give my
condolences to Mrs. Marsh.

40:57.133 --> 40:58.635
- Hello.
- Hi.

40:58.636 --> 41:00.370
Hi. Hey.

41:00.371 --> 41:01.638
Where are you off to?

41:01.639 --> 41:03.473
To my job. Where do you think?

41:03.474 --> 41:05.442
Well, I was actually hoping
maybe we could hang out...

41:05.443 --> 41:08.111
I have no time, Mom. I have to
go. I have to pull my weight.

41:08.112 --> 41:10.413
- What are you talking about?
- People need seating. Nothing. Nothing.

41:10.414 --> 41:12.582
I have nothing to say.
I'm just a college dropout.

41:12.583 --> 41:13.983
Well, wait a second. Just, wha...?

41:13.984 --> 41:15.018
Bye, honey.

41:15.019 --> 41:17.387
Well, I... What happ...?

41:17.388 --> 41:18.712
I mean, did something happen? What...?

41:18.713 --> 41:19.667
Oh, the girls had a fight.

41:19.668 --> 41:22.376
Things were said. Feelings were hurt.

41:22.726 --> 41:24.594
Henry?

41:24.595 --> 41:26.296
Sisters fight.

41:26.297 --> 41:27.463
- It's normal.
- It's not!

41:27.464 --> 41:28.631
It's not normal.

41:28.632 --> 41:30.066
None of this is normal!

41:30.067 --> 41:32.535
I got to tell you, Henry, I'm really trying

41:32.536 --> 41:36.539
to buy your argument about our normal life.

41:36.540 --> 41:38.161
It's not normal that I have no idea

41:38.162 --> 41:39.718
what is going on in my house.

41:39.719 --> 41:41.482
And it's not normal to

41:41.483 --> 41:44.832
push your feelings to the margins.

41:44.833 --> 41:47.683
The suckers don't stay there.

41:47.684 --> 41:49.619
I'm ready to talk about George.

41:49.620 --> 41:52.154
Yeah. Okay.

41:52.155 --> 41:55.791
George thought that Marsh was dirty.

41:55.792 --> 41:58.094
He thought his death wasn't an accident.

41:58.095 --> 42:01.631
- And that you might be in danger.
- Right.

42:01.632 --> 42:03.532
Then he died. At first,

42:03.533 --> 42:06.802
I thought Marsh was a
saint, a great American,

42:06.803 --> 42:08.504
the way everybody talked about him.

42:08.505 --> 42:09.705
You said he had no enemies.

42:09.706 --> 42:12.808
But it turns out, he did.

42:12.809 --> 42:14.710
The White House Chief of Staff.

42:14.711 --> 42:17.446
And the President of the United States.

42:17.447 --> 42:21.283
So, maybe George was right.

42:21.284 --> 42:23.185
Yeah.

42:23.186 --> 42:26.288
I was secretly kind of rooting for crazy.

42:26.289 --> 42:29.191
Me, too.

42:32.028 --> 42:34.263
I wish George was here.

42:34.264 --> 42:36.832
He was so...

42:36.833 --> 42:38.767
good and smart.

42:38.768 --> 42:41.704
And if he were, he could
tell me what I should do.

42:41.705 --> 42:44.339
And I do want to get to the bottom of it.

42:44.340 --> 42:47.076
I really do. I want to...
I want to figure it out.

42:47.077 --> 42:50.245
But right now, I just want to miss him.

42:53.416 --> 42:55.583
Go ahead. Miss him.
