WEBVTT

00:27.277 --> 00:29.612
I got a great experiment idea!

00:29.696 --> 00:31.614
You make my feet wheels.

00:31.698 --> 00:33.366
I won't have to walk anymore,

00:33.450 --> 00:34.492
I won't be late to events, and…

00:35.285 --> 00:37.579
Oh, no. Tell me that's not…

00:37.662 --> 00:40.415
<i> Wizard Lad</i>
<i>and the Ruby of Zubadube!</i>

00:40.498 --> 00:43.293
It just came out,
and we can't put it down!

00:43.376 --> 00:45.462
Ugh. Every time a new book comes out,

00:45.545 --> 00:47.088
you guys ignore me for a week.

00:47.172 --> 00:49.924
Oh, come on. Just give
<i>Wizard Lad</i> a chance, Johnny.

00:50.008 --> 00:53.219
It's an amazing tale
of magic and mystery…

00:53.303 --> 00:55.722
And it's only 400 pages.

00:56.389 --> 00:57.640
OK, I just threw up a little.

00:57.724 --> 01:01.853
And why waste time reading
when you could give me wheel feet?

01:01.936 --> 01:04.689
Reading is not a waste of time, Johnny.

01:04.773 --> 01:06.357
It heightens brain activity…

01:06.441 --> 01:08.943
And puts the reader
in the lead character's shoes

01:09.027 --> 01:12.072
by firing neurons
during exciting passages.

01:12.155 --> 01:14.199
And why don't you like
these books of wonder and magic?

01:14.282 --> 01:15.492
I'll tell you why.

01:15.575 --> 01:19.120
Once upon a time, there was
a wizard with a magic wand,

01:19.204 --> 01:22.248
but it still took him 400 pages
to stop a bad dude,

01:22.332 --> 01:25.794
even though he had a magic wand!

01:25.877 --> 01:29.255
Give me a magic wand,
and the book's done in ten pages, tops.

01:32.133 --> 01:34.469
We've downloaded the newest
<i>Wizard Lad</i> adventure

01:34.552 --> 01:36.888
into this virtual reality sphere.

01:36.971 --> 01:42.352
Which will take you inside the book,
where you will become<i> the</i> Wizard Lad.

01:42.435 --> 01:43.645
And I get a wand.

01:43.728 --> 01:45.730
Um, are you sure this is safe?

01:45.814 --> 01:47.482
Well, in the last book,

01:47.565 --> 01:50.151
Wizard Lad exiled
his evil nemesis, Moldywart,

01:50.235 --> 01:51.778
to the Bowels of Zandar…

01:51.861 --> 01:55.949
And his best friend, Fofo,
will be there to protect him, so, yeah.

01:56.032 --> 01:58.076
And I'll have a magic wand.

01:58.159 --> 02:00.203
-So, where am I going?

02:00.286 --> 02:02.664
To a cursed castle or a dragon's lair?

02:02.747 --> 02:05.458
No. The new book takes place in school.

02:06.251 --> 02:09.671
School?! Wait. No. No!
I changed my mind! I don't want to go.

02:13.007 --> 02:16.386
OK, so I got the wand.
And ooh, I like the cool cape.

02:19.055 --> 02:22.225
Check that. I hate the stupid cape!

02:25.478 --> 02:28.356
Probably deserved that, and sorry!

02:29.065 --> 02:32.110
Hmm. What's the first thing
I should do with you?

02:34.195 --> 02:35.530
Wheel feet!

02:35.613 --> 02:37.031
A-nice!

02:38.658 --> 02:40.493
-Wizard Lad!

02:40.577 --> 02:41.953
Wizard Lad! Wizard Lad!

02:42.036 --> 02:44.497
Wizard Lad! You're back!

02:45.248 --> 02:48.668
And somebody's learned
a wheel feet spell while he was gone.

02:48.751 --> 02:51.462
Yep. And which one of you is Fofo?

02:53.464 --> 02:55.383
Classic Wizard Lad.

02:55.466 --> 02:57.051
And where have you been?

02:57.135 --> 03:00.305
Studying for the biggest test
of the year, I'm sure.

03:01.014 --> 03:04.350
Studying? We have magic wands.

03:08.313 --> 03:11.900
We'll just magically change
our grades after the test.

03:14.152 --> 03:17.697
And now, all capes, be free!

03:22.869 --> 03:24.954
So, where are the teachers?

03:25.038 --> 03:26.623
I can make them disappear too.

03:26.706 --> 03:30.043
They're all gathered
to discuss the evil Moldywart…

03:30.126 --> 03:32.545
Who has escaped the Bowels of Zandar

03:32.629 --> 03:35.131
and is now out for revenge.

03:35.214 --> 03:36.925
And who does he want revenge on?

03:37.008 --> 03:40.637
Well, since it was your magic
that sent him to Zandar,

03:40.720 --> 03:42.305
I'd say… you.

03:42.388 --> 03:44.933
-Come again?

03:50.188 --> 03:51.940
Moldywart!

03:52.023 --> 03:53.858
Wizard Lad!

03:53.942 --> 03:59.030
After what you did to me,
I cannot wait to get my revenge.

04:01.157 --> 04:04.994
Yeah, I have no idea what I did to you,
cos I didn't read the book.

04:05.078 --> 04:08.414
But I<i> do</i> have a magic wand
and wheels for feet.

04:09.499 --> 04:12.794
So… I think I'm gonna have
some more fun now.

04:15.171 --> 04:16.130
Uh…

04:16.214 --> 04:21.761
First, I'm going to destroy you,
then find the Ruby of Zubadube

04:21.844 --> 04:24.555
so I can destroy this entire school!

04:24.639 --> 04:30.061
Then, if there's time, I'll resurrect you
so I can destroy you again.

04:30.144 --> 04:33.898
Dude! You're still mad about something
that happened 30 years ago?

04:33.982 --> 04:36.025
You're magic. Move on.

04:36.109 --> 04:38.528
Like I'm moving on
from this conversation,

04:38.611 --> 04:41.781
cos Johnny wonders what other cool stuff
I can do with this wand.

04:41.864 --> 04:44.367
You can battle me
in the never-ending woods

04:44.450 --> 04:46.786
and meet your doom!

04:47.537 --> 04:48.621
This might be bad.

04:54.627 --> 04:56.504
Um, what's going on?

04:56.587 --> 05:00.174
Johnny just had an explosive spike
in brain activity.

05:00.258 --> 05:02.593
Uh-huh, which means?

05:02.677 --> 05:05.638
Well, if his brain doesn't
calm down to regular levels…

05:05.722 --> 05:09.392
It could… explode.

05:09.475 --> 05:11.102
Get him out!

05:11.185 --> 05:12.103
No!

05:12.186 --> 05:16.232
An instant drop from his heightened state
could be just as damaging.

05:16.316 --> 05:19.027
OK, but it's Johnny.
He can solve anything.

05:19.110 --> 05:20.111
Where is he in the book?

05:20.194 --> 05:23.948
Well, we only read up to where
Wizard Lad returns to Dumbledumb…

05:24.032 --> 05:26.034
And then…

05:26.117 --> 05:28.453
Moldywart comes back?

05:28.536 --> 05:31.456
Johnny will have no chance
against his dark magic.

05:31.539 --> 05:33.374
What do we do?

05:35.793 --> 05:38.212
Uh, doggie no like this.

05:39.422 --> 05:42.759
OK, falling, about to crash
in dark forest and…

05:42.842 --> 05:44.218
Oh, wait!

05:47.346 --> 05:50.058
Oh, if only magic wands were real.

05:50.141 --> 05:51.350
Fofo!

05:52.393 --> 05:54.020
Oh, so you're Fofo.

05:54.103 --> 05:56.898
-Fofo!
-Yeah, you said that.

05:56.981 --> 05:58.441
Now, how do I get out of here?

05:58.775 --> 05:59.776
Fofo!

05:59.859 --> 06:03.362
Uh-huh, yeah. Now, what do I do?!

06:03.446 --> 06:05.698
You can start by calming down.

06:05.782 --> 06:07.158
Dukey!

06:07.241 --> 06:09.786
You're a weird dragon dog!

06:09.869 --> 06:11.662
Heh heh, cool, right?

06:11.746 --> 06:14.624
No. And<i> Wizard Lad</i>
seems like a wild story

06:14.707 --> 06:18.211
that I'll still never read,
and I wanna go home now!

06:18.294 --> 06:19.837
So calm down.

06:19.921 --> 06:24.801
You need to slow your brain activity
so Susan and Mary can extract you safely.

06:24.884 --> 06:27.512
Now, deep breaths, deep breaths…

06:30.223 --> 06:33.351
Good, just a few more, and…

06:35.478 --> 06:37.647
OK, we'll just start again.

06:37.730 --> 06:40.066
Ow!

06:40.149 --> 06:44.278
You will not defeat me again, Wizard Lad.

06:45.947 --> 06:49.325
Uh-huh, yeah. Magic-wand fight!

06:49.408 --> 06:51.077
Oooh… bow-woo!

06:54.831 --> 06:56.999
A charging-bull spell?

06:57.083 --> 06:59.418
That's Magic 101.

06:59.502 --> 07:02.964
Get ready for the advanced course.

07:06.926 --> 07:08.678
Whoa, that was really weird.

07:08.761 --> 07:13.182
You do know you can only use
a disappear spell once, right?

07:13.891 --> 07:17.395
I didn't know that,
cos I don't like these books!

07:18.396 --> 07:19.605
And now I hate them.

07:23.734 --> 07:25.445
Like I was saying, breathe deep!

07:25.528 --> 07:27.655
If you calm down, we can get you out!

07:27.738 --> 07:30.908
OK, well, maybe if you can fly straight,
I could calm down!

07:30.992 --> 07:33.244
Well, I've never had wings before!

07:36.497 --> 07:39.208
Yes! His brain waves are lowering.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.335
Quick, let's get them out!

07:43.087 --> 07:45.214
Now what happened?

07:48.176 --> 07:50.428
You are a terrible dragon!

07:50.511 --> 07:53.306
Well, if you would just read,
we wouldn't be in this book

07:53.389 --> 07:55.516
and I wouldn't have to be a dragon!

07:56.142 --> 07:59.020
Johnny, it's Wolfsmouth Cave!

07:59.687 --> 08:01.481
What? No way!

08:01.564 --> 08:02.940
Why do I care?

08:03.024 --> 08:06.736
Because it watches over
the Ruby of Zubadube.

08:09.614 --> 08:11.282
OK, that's cool.

08:12.992 --> 08:17.788
And the wizard that possesses it
gains any power he wishes.

08:17.872 --> 08:20.458
Like getting us out of this book!

08:23.377 --> 08:25.296
Whoa. Didn't see that comin'.

08:25.379 --> 08:27.381
I'll get the ruby, Johnny!

08:30.760 --> 08:31.677
Nope.

08:31.761 --> 08:34.597
And now it's your turn, Wizard Lad,

08:34.680 --> 08:39.685
to be exiled to the Bowels of Zandar,
as you exiled me.

08:41.437 --> 08:46.776
Again, not sure how I did that,
but I was probably pretty awesome, so…

08:46.859 --> 08:50.321
You couldn't defeat me
without the Ruby of Zubadube.

08:50.404 --> 08:52.949
What chance do you have now?

08:53.032 --> 08:55.993
Well, um, because I have, uh…

08:57.328 --> 08:59.664
the Stone of Fortitude!

08:59.747 --> 09:03.876
Yeah… there's no Stone of Fortitude.
That's just a rock.

09:04.377 --> 09:08.381
I mean, the Slab of Sorcery!

09:08.464 --> 09:11.884
That's just tree bark
and has absolutely no powers.

09:12.593 --> 09:14.428
Yes, it does.

09:16.138 --> 09:17.848
My wart!

09:18.349 --> 09:20.184
Fire, dragon-dog!

09:24.855 --> 09:28.192
Stink at flying. Great with fire.

09:28.276 --> 09:33.489
You may have ruined my wand,
but I still have the ruby!

09:33.573 --> 09:35.449
And for that,

09:35.533 --> 09:37.368
I will exile both of--

09:38.244 --> 09:40.663
Get them off of me! Off!

09:40.746 --> 09:41.998
Help! Help!

09:42.081 --> 09:44.083
Uh, what's with the capes?

09:44.166 --> 09:46.836
I freed them earlier,
and I think they're returning the favor.

09:48.254 --> 09:49.380
Ooh!

09:55.303 --> 09:59.348
Wizard Lad, you stopped Moldywart
once again.

09:59.432 --> 10:02.226
And found the Ruby of Zubadube.

10:02.310 --> 10:06.272
Which means Moldywart will not be
destroying me or Dumbledumb

10:06.355 --> 10:07.815
for a long time.

10:07.898 --> 10:11.611
You may have defeated me
this time, Wizard Lad,

10:11.694 --> 10:13.446
and two times before that…

10:13.529 --> 10:16.449
but I will destroy you!

10:16.532 --> 10:19.368
Dude, what is your beef with Wizard Lad?

10:19.452 --> 10:20.578
I mean, me?

10:20.661 --> 10:25.416
Your parents mocked my moldy wart
when I was a kid at this school,

10:25.499 --> 10:29.837
but I vowed to return and make them pay.

10:30.421 --> 10:32.965
You know you had a magic wand, right?

10:34.717 --> 10:37.970
My wart! It's gone!

10:38.054 --> 10:39.930
Now, why didn't I think of that?

10:40.014 --> 10:42.642
OK, I think things
at Dumbledumb are looking up.

10:42.725 --> 10:46.228
And your brain is finally calming down.

10:49.273 --> 10:51.192
Yes! He's out of the book!

10:51.275 --> 10:52.902
And his brain didn't explode.

10:52.985 --> 10:56.405
So, what do you think
about<i> Wizard Lad</i> now?

10:56.489 --> 11:00.117
OK, fine, I admit it.
<i>Wizard Lad</i> is pretty cool.

11:00.201 --> 11:03.037
So you're going
to read them now?

11:03.120 --> 11:04.955
What? No. Never!

11:06.123 --> 11:07.833
But, just curious,

11:07.917 --> 11:12.088
how did Wizard Lad crush Moldywart
and exile him to the Bowels of Zandar?

11:12.171 --> 11:15.341
It's right there in the fourth book.

11:18.386 --> 11:20.096
Stop looking at me.
