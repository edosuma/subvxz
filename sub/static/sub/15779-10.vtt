00:06.790 --> 00:07.880
Minions!

00:08.000 --> 00:10.130
Reduce speed to impulse power!

00:10.260 --> 00:11.630
Charge the lightning cannon!

00:11.760 --> 00:13.880
All battle stations at the ready!

00:14.010 --> 00:19.140
At my signal, we show this Dr. Venture
the true power of the cocoon!

00:21.020 --> 00:24.770
Well, team, it looks like I've got
myself a costumed arch enemy.

00:24.890 --> 00:27.350
Not quite sure what the flying
pine cone is all about...

00:27.480 --> 00:29.610
but I'll give Mr. Evergreen
a run for his money!

00:29.730 --> 00:30.860
♪ For he's a jolly good fellow ♪

00:30.980 --> 00:33.820
No time for inappropriate
and baffling sing-song, Neddy!

00:33.950 --> 00:37.450
Venture team! Assemble Ventronic!

00:40.040 --> 00:42.160
Ventronic Gold is go!

00:44.500 --> 00:47.000
Ventronic Blue is go!

00:48.840 --> 00:50.540
Ventronic Red is go!

00:50.670 --> 00:53.210
Weee! Slide fun!

00:53.340 --> 00:54.880
Nooo, no no!

00:55.010 --> 00:56.340
Neddy don't like!

00:56.470 --> 00:58.890
Assemble Ventronic!

01:05.269 --> 01:06.560
Join me!

01:06.690 --> 01:10.730
I form the legs!

01:10.860 --> 01:14.990
I form the right arm!

01:15.110 --> 01:16.240
I'm flying!

01:16.360 --> 01:18.200
Make a happy smile!

01:22.990 --> 01:25.540
Go Ventronic!

01:28.630 --> 01:30.040
What the fuck is that thing?!

01:30.170 --> 01:32.540
Umm, I think it's a giant robot...

01:32.670 --> 01:35.380
with an ice cream cone
for one of its arms... I think.

01:35.510 --> 01:36.840
Fire the lightning cannon!

01:36.970 --> 01:38.220
Aim for the head.

01:38.340 --> 01:40.050
I want to be able to smell
the burning flesh...

01:40.180 --> 01:42.890
of that little Venture abomination!

01:46.060 --> 01:48.270
The lightning cannon sucks!

01:48.390 --> 01:49.810
Who loaded it with robot food?

01:49.940 --> 01:52.360
Evasive action. Hard astern.

01:54.650 --> 01:56.690
Ventronic Blue,
use the energy blade!

01:56.820 --> 01:57.950
Aye, aye boss!

01:59.000 --> 02:05.074

02:32.360 --> 02:33.520
The helm is not responding!

02:33.650 --> 02:34.900
All systems are down.

02:35.020 --> 02:36.980
We're sitting ducks!

02:37.110 --> 02:39.280
Hail Venture on the big screen.

02:39.400 --> 02:41.240
- Bringing him up--
- Wait!

02:41.360 --> 02:42.990
I wanna do something. Hold on.

02:44.830 --> 02:48.500
You have one minute to surrender
your big robot thing!

02:48.620 --> 02:51.080
If you refuse, we will open fire!

02:51.210 --> 02:52.330
How about this--

02:52.460 --> 02:55.590
I'll give you 20 seconds
to kiss your wife for the last time...

02:55.710 --> 02:58.760
then I finish you off, Mr. Evergreen.

02:58.880 --> 03:00.800
I-I'm the Monarch.

03:00.930 --> 03:03.300
Oh, so the flying pine cone's a--

03:03.430 --> 03:05.800
Cocoon. OK, I'll be right back.

03:05.930 --> 03:07.180
He didn't go for it.

03:07.310 --> 03:08.850
I even did that cool spin thing.

03:08.980 --> 03:10.520
It's a bit of a cliché.

03:10.640 --> 03:11.940
OK, alright, I have another idea.

03:12.060 --> 03:14.270
I'm trying to arch here!

03:14.400 --> 03:16.020
This isn't how it's done! Honestly!

03:16.150 --> 03:17.940
Wh-What are you doing, ya retard?!

03:18.070 --> 03:20.070
- No-no word!
- Yes it is, Neddy.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.110
Did he just cut me off?

03:21.240 --> 03:24.410
Retard is a hateful word.
We don't use those slurs.

03:24.530 --> 03:25.820
I'm your arch enemy!

03:25.950 --> 03:29.040
I'm not gonna use "bungling boobs,"
or "meddling kids."

03:29.160 --> 03:30.370
It's not my style.

03:30.500 --> 03:32.080
That guy needs to get a thicker skin.

03:32.210 --> 03:33.210
Thicker skin?

03:33.330 --> 03:36.040
Poor Ned has skin
that's three inches thick.

03:36.170 --> 03:38.250
Now how do you think
that makes him feel?

03:38.380 --> 03:39.710
Itchy? I don't know.

03:39.840 --> 03:42.300
Just keep it cat and mouse,
not cat and missile.

03:42.430 --> 03:44.970
So it's a game? We fake fight?

03:45.090 --> 03:46.050
That's ridiculous.

03:46.180 --> 03:47.720
No, we sharpen our claws.

03:47.850 --> 03:49.390
It's like fencing.

03:49.520 --> 03:50.890
It's about the art of the fight.

03:51.020 --> 03:51.890
Good.

03:52.020 --> 03:54.900
Well, I'm about to deliver
my killing stroke. Then what?

03:55.020 --> 03:56.900
Then the Guild steps up their game.

03:57.020 --> 03:59.320
You throw a rock, they throw a knife.

03:59.440 --> 04:02.150
You throw a knife they come
to your house when you're sleeping...

04:02.280 --> 04:03.610
and murder your family.

04:03.740 --> 04:05.240
Look, Dr. Venture...

04:05.370 --> 04:06.660
I love saying that.

04:06.780 --> 04:08.910
You call the Guild
and you get the damned rulebook.

04:09.040 --> 04:09.910
I'll be waiting.

04:10.040 --> 04:14.370
One false move and I will
destroy you...utterly! Off screen!

04:14.500 --> 04:16.209
How'd that look?
Could they see the fire?

04:16.329 --> 04:17.750
I don't think we're fooling anybody.

04:17.880 --> 04:20.380
We have to come up
with something soon or it is over.

04:20.510 --> 04:21.760
You didn't marry a fool!

04:21.880 --> 04:24.510
Believe me, no Venture
will take down the Monarch!

04:24.630 --> 04:27.220
Engineering,
restore impulse power!

04:27.350 --> 04:29.640
Henchmen 21 and 24,
front and center!

04:29.760 --> 04:34.140
And henchman number one.

04:34.270 --> 04:38.610
I want you three to execute
a Dark S-7 Maneuver.

04:38.730 --> 04:39.730
On the double.

04:39.860 --> 04:42.360
Yes, Monarch.

04:42.490 --> 04:44.490
I gotta ask this--

04:44.610 --> 04:47.990
Is there a reason
you always use 21 and 24?

04:48.120 --> 04:49.620
I know it sounds crazy...

04:49.740 --> 04:53.330
but they both have that rare blend
of expendable and invulnerable...

04:53.450 --> 04:55.750
that makes for a perfect henchman.

04:56.870 --> 04:57.790
Alright, please tell me you know...

04:57.920 --> 05:00.040
what the hell a Dark S-7 Maneuver is.

05:00.170 --> 05:01.300
I think it's when, uh--

05:01.420 --> 05:03.760
The "dark" prefix indicates
that it's a stealth maneuver.

05:03.880 --> 05:04.970
The S-7 indicates that--

05:05.090 --> 05:06.510
Dude, who are you?

05:06.630 --> 05:08.390
24 and I work as a duo.

05:09.100 --> 05:10.220
We've done all we can.

05:10.350 --> 05:12.390
I'm sorry your placement
isn't working out.

05:12.520 --> 05:14.470
But really, it's not our problem.

05:14.600 --> 05:18.310
The Guild of Calamitous Intent
is antagonist relations only.

05:18.440 --> 05:20.360
Well, who handles the good guys?

05:20.480 --> 05:21.440
Whoa!

05:21.570 --> 05:23.980
I think the less hurtful term
is "protagonists."

05:24.110 --> 05:24.990
Oh, yeah, sorry.

05:25.110 --> 05:27.150
Who handles the protagonists?

05:27.280 --> 05:30.410
What, are you serious?
O.S.I., duh!

05:30.530 --> 05:31.830
Can you patch me through?

05:31.950 --> 05:32.910
Oh, sure.

05:33.040 --> 05:35.410
Just let me get my red phone, the hotline.

05:35.540 --> 05:37.660
No, I'll shine the O.S.I. Signal.

05:37.790 --> 05:41.170
No, no, no-- if we really believe
and click our heels, they'll--

05:41.290 --> 05:43.460
OK, OK! I get it.

05:44.090 --> 05:46.340
Newbie. Did you see his creepy little body?

05:46.470 --> 05:47.920
Oh, my God, when you were a kid...

05:48.050 --> 05:50.760
did you ever make G.I. Joe
hump Rainbow Brite?

05:50.890 --> 05:51.800
Yeah.

05:51.930 --> 05:53.600
He's what their kid would have looked like.

05:56.310 --> 05:58.020
They're retreating, follow them!

05:58.140 --> 05:59.190
Belay that order!

05:59.310 --> 06:01.150
Sweetie, what are you doing?

06:01.270 --> 06:02.190
I'm sorry.

06:02.320 --> 06:04.270
We barely have enough power
to stay afloat.

06:04.400 --> 06:06.360
And we don't have
one weapon online.

06:06.490 --> 06:08.030
Do you trust me?

06:08.150 --> 06:09.530
Uh...

06:09.660 --> 06:10.660
Kind of.

06:10.780 --> 06:11.950
Well, it's now or never.

06:12.080 --> 06:13.370
You have to trust me!

06:13.490 --> 06:15.120
Follow them!

06:15.240 --> 06:16.830
Incoming from Venture.

06:16.950 --> 06:20.710
Perfect. Bring him up on the big screen!

06:20.830 --> 06:22.670
Monarch, you have been bested.

06:22.790 --> 06:23.880
Now cease this non--

06:24.000 --> 06:25.880
Butterfly!

06:26.010 --> 06:27.210
Pretty!

06:27.340 --> 06:29.380
Thank you, Neddy. I'll handle this.

06:29.510 --> 06:32.300
Sorry, we like to let Ned
make his own decisions.

06:32.430 --> 06:35.680
Then I hope he decides to kiss
his leathery ass goodbye.

06:35.810 --> 06:38.140
You have played right into my trap...

06:38.270 --> 06:40.560
and now you die!

06:40.690 --> 06:43.360
Fire the lightning cannon!

06:46.070 --> 06:49.360
Engineering, jettison the lightning cannon
out the port hatch!

06:49.490 --> 06:53.070
Navigation,
adjust attitude X and Y 20 degrees!

06:53.200 --> 06:56.990
Dr. Girlfriend, cut all external power!

07:02.880 --> 07:03.750
What was that about?

07:03.880 --> 07:05.920
Some men are controlled
by their hatred.

07:06.050 --> 07:09.590
Clouds their senses and leads
them down the path of ruin.

07:09.720 --> 07:11.130
Let that be a lesson to you.

07:11.260 --> 07:13.390
I guess I shouldn't finish
that giant cocoon...

07:13.510 --> 07:14.430
I was building, then.

07:14.550 --> 07:16.930
OK! I was a pirate! I get it!

07:17.060 --> 07:19.470
Look, if you can't get over my pirate past...

07:19.600 --> 07:21.140
we'll never move forward.

07:21.270 --> 07:23.520
Boys, the Monarch is retreating.

07:23.650 --> 07:25.110
Now isn't the time for this.

07:25.230 --> 07:28.440
Agreed. Back to Spider Skull Island.

07:28.570 --> 07:30.110
We'll reformulate our methods there!

07:30.240 --> 07:32.400
Yes, let's ignore the pirate.

07:32.530 --> 07:33.740
He used to be bad.

07:33.870 --> 07:37.120
Ventronic, take us home!

07:37.240 --> 07:39.450
I know you can hear me.

07:39.580 --> 07:40.870
Navigation!

07:41.000 --> 07:43.420
Get this heap to the lair.

07:43.540 --> 07:44.460
Get up.

07:44.580 --> 07:47.250
We need to make some
modifications to the cocoon.

07:47.380 --> 07:49.340
Yeah, are you gonna tell me
what the hell you have planned?

07:49.460 --> 07:51.010
Why? You don't trust me?

07:51.130 --> 07:53.220
I mean, I'm trying to.

07:53.340 --> 07:55.510
It's not that I don't--
You know, you--

07:55.640 --> 07:57.510
You...

07:57.640 --> 07:59.760
Just help me get
this chair loose.

07:59.890 --> 08:01.850
O.S.I., can I help you?

08:01.980 --> 08:04.980
Yes, this is Dr. Jonas Venture, Jr.

08:05.100 --> 08:08.360
Can you connect me to the office
of Arch Relations, please?

08:08.480 --> 08:10.360
This is O.S.I. Dry Cleaning
and Laundromat.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.240
I think you have
the wrong number.

08:12.360 --> 08:14.070
I'm quite sure I dialed it correctly.

08:14.200 --> 08:16.070
I'm quite sure I'm ironing a shirt.

08:16.200 --> 08:18.070
You have the wrong number
there, buddy.

08:18.200 --> 08:20.700
Boss, there's somebody
knocking at the front door.

08:20.830 --> 08:22.330
Knock at the front door?

08:22.460 --> 08:23.790
This is an isolated island.

08:23.920 --> 08:26.080
Who just drops by and knocks
at the front door?

08:26.210 --> 08:29.000
Didn't even know we had a front door.

08:29.130 --> 08:30.420
Jonas Venture, Jr.?

08:30.550 --> 08:32.669
Oh, sorry, matey,
you want the boss man.

08:32.799 --> 08:34.049
I'll-- urgh.

08:34.179 --> 08:36.510
Is there a reason you just darted my man?

08:36.640 --> 08:38.429
I didn't see you down there.

08:38.549 --> 08:40.220
- Jonas Venture, Jr.?
- I am.

08:40.350 --> 08:42.179
So who are the dead men
I'm speaking to?

08:42.309 --> 08:43.730
- That's a joke.
- Regular cut-up.

08:43.850 --> 08:45.310
They should give him
a reality show.

08:45.440 --> 08:47.020
- I'd watch it.
- I'd watch it twice.

08:47.150 --> 08:48.190
Even if Flavor Flav was in it.

08:48.310 --> 08:49.520
My name is Mr. Doe...

08:49.650 --> 08:51.650
and this is my associate,
Mr. Cardholder.

08:51.780 --> 08:53.150
Sorry about putting
your man down.

08:53.280 --> 08:54.190
Precautionary.

08:54.320 --> 08:56.240
A harmless tranquilizer dart.
You understand.

08:56.360 --> 08:58.780
Judging from your shoot first
ask questions later tactics...

08:58.910 --> 09:00.530
I'll just assume you men
are with the O.S.I.?

09:00.660 --> 09:02.240
O.S.I.? Never heard of it.

09:02.370 --> 09:04.870
Dr. Venture, you know that
the O.S.I. denies any knowledge...

09:05.000 --> 09:06.870
of the Guild of Calamitous Intent?

09:07.000 --> 09:08.330
I never mentioned the Guild.

09:08.460 --> 09:09.380
No, but I did.

09:09.500 --> 09:10.540
We were just passing by...

09:10.670 --> 09:12.550
and heard that you have
a butterfly problem.

09:12.670 --> 09:16.050
And you see, me and my associate here
are amateur lepidopterists.

09:16.180 --> 09:19.390
You... wanna see my stamp collection?

09:19.510 --> 09:21.100
Only if we were philatelists.

09:21.220 --> 09:23.100
Which we aren't, Mr. Smart guy.

09:25.850 --> 09:28.230
Oh, my head's gonna explode.
I can't hear squat.

09:28.350 --> 09:30.400
You should perform
the Valsalva Maneuver.

09:30.520 --> 09:33.400
Look, Mister
"I'm the Best Henchman Ever..."

09:33.530 --> 09:34.900
we'll get to business in a second.

09:35.030 --> 09:36.070
I'm trying to pop my ear.

09:36.200 --> 09:37.740
The Valsalva Maneuver is...

09:37.860 --> 09:40.200
when you adjust the pressure
in your middle ear, silly.

09:40.320 --> 09:41.910
A swallow or a yawn should do the trick.

09:42.030 --> 09:43.120
That has a name?

09:43.240 --> 09:44.740
Listen, dude, don't get cozy with us.

09:44.870 --> 09:46.250
You're the guy who doesn't come back.

09:46.370 --> 09:48.000
Yes, some guy who just shows up...

09:48.120 --> 09:50.170
that nobody's ever seen before.

09:50.290 --> 09:51.670
Right, and he's all professional.

09:51.790 --> 09:53.420
Yeah, dude, you're a goner.

09:53.550 --> 09:59.090
Let me tell you a story
about a little henchman named Speedy.

10:02.680 --> 10:04.260
Oh! Argh!

10:04.390 --> 10:06.520
Captain! You OK?

10:06.640 --> 10:09.100
Man, get off my back... Mom!

10:09.230 --> 10:11.350
Sorry. You look like you needed help.

10:11.480 --> 10:13.110
So I'm a disappointment, I guess.

10:13.230 --> 10:14.270
Help the pirate.

10:14.400 --> 10:16.610
The pirate can't do anything for himself.

10:16.740 --> 10:19.450
Why are you such a bitch?
Like you're perfect.

10:19.570 --> 10:21.070
What has gotten into you?

10:21.200 --> 10:24.160
Sweet tranquilizer dart, that's what.

10:24.290 --> 10:25.290
So get out!

10:25.410 --> 10:27.540
You're always trying
to bring me down.

10:28.910 --> 10:30.670
And bring me a fucking sandwich!

10:30.790 --> 10:34.090
- The Monarch has killed...
- As in cold blooded murdered.

10:34.210 --> 10:35.500
...his last five arch enemies.

10:35.630 --> 10:37.130
Now that sounds like a violation to me.

10:37.260 --> 10:39.130
Sounds like a violation
to anyone with ears.

10:39.260 --> 10:40.130
So what now?

10:40.260 --> 10:42.140
I'm not sure
what the proper procedure is...

10:42.260 --> 10:43.510
for dealing with unhinged...

10:43.640 --> 10:46.180
and quite honestly,
incompetent arch enemies.

10:46.310 --> 10:47.310
We are recommending...

10:47.430 --> 10:49.640
that you pin this butterfly
to a piece of cardboard.

10:49.770 --> 10:51.310
As in cold-blooded murder.

10:51.440 --> 10:54.900
To assist us in this matter we took
the liberty of inviting an exterminator.

10:55.020 --> 10:57.820
A specialist in your
specific bug problem.

10:57.940 --> 11:00.490
Little man has friend waiting to play.

11:00.610 --> 11:02.110
Tickles.

11:02.240 --> 11:04.320
That's quite a monster you got.
He have a leash?

11:04.450 --> 11:06.410
I bet his eyes are
as gooey as the next guy's.

11:06.540 --> 11:07.660
Funny hat!

11:07.790 --> 11:08.950
Ned wants funny hat!

11:09.080 --> 11:11.000
Lower it, Cardholder. The ape's daffy.

11:11.120 --> 11:13.210
Head full of pudding.

11:13.330 --> 11:14.250
Friend!

11:14.380 --> 11:16.500
Looks like our exterminator
has arrived.

11:16.630 --> 11:18.460
Hey! Hey, hey!

11:18.590 --> 11:20.380
I'm not supposed to be in here!

11:27.680 --> 11:30.560
I see, so you just want
to kill the Monarch.

11:30.690 --> 11:33.060
That seems like
the sporting thing to do.

11:33.190 --> 11:36.060
You wanna what, shoot him?
And all his men and his wife?

11:36.190 --> 11:38.020
You could steal his cattle, too.

11:38.150 --> 11:40.110
Maybe burn his village down?

11:40.240 --> 11:41.820
It's an antiquated system.

11:41.950 --> 11:45.740
I mean, my father did this
fake arch enemy nonsense in the '60s.

11:45.870 --> 11:48.080
Maybe my brother is good
with this namby-pamby...

11:48.200 --> 11:51.080
guy-in-a-costume-chases-you-around
nonsense, but I'm not.

11:51.210 --> 11:54.500
No disrespect, Jonas,
but it isn't so easy.

11:54.630 --> 11:57.750
These guys like their system.
It's what they do.

11:57.880 --> 11:58.880
You take that away...

11:59.000 --> 12:01.630
and you are looking at a bunch
of pissed off nut bags...

12:01.760 --> 12:04.430
with ray guns and giant-- I don't know...

12:04.550 --> 12:08.180
a giant octopus slash tank
with laser eyes.

12:08.310 --> 12:09.260
I've seen one of those.

12:09.390 --> 12:10.770
I like the cut of this guy's jib.

12:10.890 --> 12:11.890
I like the cut of his hair.

12:12.020 --> 12:13.060
All right, fine.

12:13.190 --> 12:15.060
Then what if we keep it traditional?

12:15.190 --> 12:18.020
This Monarch character has
broken some rules.

12:18.150 --> 12:19.770
If by "rules," you mean skulls.

12:19.900 --> 12:22.190
And if by "broken," you mean pulverized.

12:22.320 --> 12:23.740
So we put on a big show.

12:23.860 --> 12:26.360
We do it like
dear old Daddy Venture would've.

12:26.490 --> 12:27.700
Then everybody's happy.

12:27.830 --> 12:29.030
Everybody but the Monarch.

12:29.160 --> 12:31.040
What do you have in mind?

12:32.830 --> 12:34.040
I'm gonna fall off it.

12:34.170 --> 12:36.880
Just use nails for now, or glue. I don't care.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.880
- All right, here it is.
- Give me the news!

12:39.000 --> 12:41.800
If Protagonist aggression
exceeds Level 8--

12:41.920 --> 12:43.760
I think trying to actually
kill me is at least that.

12:43.880 --> 12:46.800
The Antagonist, in the case
of survival or escape...

12:46.930 --> 12:48.680
is granted extended vengeance.

12:48.800 --> 12:52.520
This includes Guild sanctioned
immediate reIatives.

12:52.640 --> 12:55.310
So, all I gotta do is stay alive...

12:55.440 --> 12:57.190
and Rusty Venture is mine?

12:57.310 --> 12:58.440
That's what it says.

12:58.560 --> 13:00.730
Dr. Venture is a Guild
sanctioned rel-- Whoa!

13:00.860 --> 13:03.360
Finally! Vengeance is mine!

13:04.200 --> 13:06.320
Which one of you idiots
broke my wife?

13:20.340 --> 13:21.590
What are you guys doing?

13:21.710 --> 13:23.630
I'm freezing. Can we be done, please?

13:23.760 --> 13:25.510
Yeah, I swallowed
too much water.

13:25.630 --> 13:28.090
Now I'm gonna get diarrhea,
thank you very much.

13:28.220 --> 13:30.300
That tunnel down there leads
to the main room.

13:30.430 --> 13:32.310
Take a deep breath.
I'm not sure how long it is.

13:32.430 --> 13:36.350
No way! I got freaked out
when I had to do that playing Tomb Raider.

13:36.480 --> 13:38.850
Oh, and she did that creepy
drowning, contortion thing.

13:38.980 --> 13:40.940
That was grizzly.
Yeah, no way.

13:41.070 --> 13:42.190
What? We have to.

13:42.320 --> 13:43.940
This is how we get to the main room...

13:44.070 --> 13:46.030
to complete the Dark S-7 Maneuver.

13:46.150 --> 13:48.660
OK, fine, I'll go ahead alone.

13:48.780 --> 13:50.950
Going alone?

13:51.080 --> 13:53.740
This is why you new guys always die.

13:53.870 --> 13:55.830
You just can't smell
a cliché coming.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.830
Dude, you are way too into this.

13:57.960 --> 13:59.580
Seriously, what kind of douche...

13:59.710 --> 14:01.670
would blindly swim
an underwater tunnel?

14:01.790 --> 14:02.750
Then what--

14:02.880 --> 14:04.460
Yeah, what about going that way?

14:04.590 --> 14:05.800
It's hardly the best route.

14:05.920 --> 14:09.840
Hands up, who peed in the water?

14:09.970 --> 14:12.140
Well, I guess we could go that way.

14:12.260 --> 14:13.640
Check it out, gentlemen.

14:13.760 --> 14:17.480
Constructed by a little old
villain named Scaramantula...

14:17.600 --> 14:19.890
and only used on Sundays
to go to church.

14:20.020 --> 14:21.980
Been dying to give it a spin.

14:22.110 --> 14:23.310
Aww, no fucking way.

14:23.440 --> 14:25.280
Late '60s Ultra Death Ray!

14:25.400 --> 14:26.650
She's amazing.

14:26.780 --> 14:29.320
Saddle operated
with Doom Co. Gearing.

14:29.450 --> 14:31.160
Freaking gorgeous.

14:31.280 --> 14:32.820
If that were a woman, I'd marry her.

14:32.950 --> 14:35.370
And I'd jeopardize our friendship
by nailing your hot wife.

14:35.490 --> 14:37.000
Gyroscopic positioning?

14:37.120 --> 14:38.870
At six points.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.420
And get this, it comes up
out of the top of the Skull.

14:42.540 --> 14:43.840
That's how it's done.

14:43.960 --> 14:46.210
I didn't know there was a museum...

14:46.340 --> 14:47.920
to Dr. Venture on this island.

14:48.050 --> 14:49.380
This is awesome!

14:49.510 --> 14:51.840
You think there are rides,
or, like, a moonwalk?

14:51.970 --> 14:54.140
One of you have an extra electro patch?

14:54.260 --> 14:56.180
No, we don't wear our utility belts.

14:56.310 --> 14:57.220
Yeah, they're dorky.

14:57.350 --> 14:59.020
Kinda like fanny packs for henchmen.

14:59.140 --> 15:00.730
Plus they make me look fat.

15:00.850 --> 15:02.400
Blame it on the utility belt.

15:02.520 --> 15:04.190
And you guys think I'm gonna die.

15:04.320 --> 15:06.480
I carry my full complement of utilities.

15:06.610 --> 15:09.190
He says as he electrocutes himself.

15:09.320 --> 15:10.860
I'm not gonna die! Stop it!

15:10.990 --> 15:13.410
He grabs a bomb on accident right here.

15:13.530 --> 15:14.570
Kaboom!

15:14.700 --> 15:15.870
I'm not gonna die.

15:15.990 --> 15:19.540
Yeah, and then the snake jumps out
and bites you right on your eye.

15:19.660 --> 15:20.750
Stop it!

15:20.870 --> 15:22.870
OK, done. Easy peasy.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.210
So now you know what
the Dark S-7 Maneuver is.

15:25.340 --> 15:27.000
We do?

15:28.460 --> 15:30.210
I'm getting good at rebuilding this thing.

15:30.340 --> 15:31.340
It looks like it should.

15:31.470 --> 15:34.090
No, it looks pretty good
if you don't turn your head.

15:34.220 --> 15:36.550
Monarch, the S-7 Maneuver is complete!

15:36.680 --> 15:38.810
It was? Those idiots are amazing.

15:38.930 --> 15:41.520
All right. Engage the Capricorn Device!

15:41.640 --> 15:44.400
Then bring the wee Venture freak
up on the...

15:44.520 --> 15:47.520
little screen we just wheeled
in front of my throne.

15:47.650 --> 15:48.730
Hailing him now.

15:50.280 --> 15:52.070
Thought you got rid of me?

15:52.200 --> 15:56.240
On the contrary, my dear Monarch
I was hoping to hear from you.

15:56.370 --> 15:58.410
And were you hoping that I was racing...

15:58.540 --> 16:02.160
my newly revamped flying cocoon
toward your island?

16:03.460 --> 16:06.710
He's about 20 miles offshore.

16:06.840 --> 16:08.000
He is really humming.

16:08.130 --> 16:10.090
I didn't even know that thing
could move like that.

16:10.210 --> 16:12.380
Goodbye, Dr. Venture.

16:12.510 --> 16:16.680
You might want to make a list
of questions for your father.

16:22.020 --> 16:24.100
- Did you get that?
- It was kinda vague.

16:24.230 --> 16:25.400
Well, his father's dead.

16:25.520 --> 16:29.110
So, you know, he can ask him stuff
because he'll be joining him in Hell.

16:29.230 --> 16:31.990
Ah! I should have said the "Hell" part.
That would have been cool.

16:32.110 --> 16:33.650
Yeah, that would have been
the way to go.

16:33.780 --> 16:35.660
That, and then the menacing laugh.

16:35.780 --> 16:39.830
So the butterfly falls willingly
into the Spider Skull's web.

16:39.950 --> 16:41.790
- Mmmm, nope.
- Just a bit confusing.

16:41.910 --> 16:43.540
Good try though.

16:43.660 --> 16:45.290
It's my first shot at it.

16:45.420 --> 16:47.580
You know, I'm starting to see
the allure of all this.

16:47.710 --> 16:49.460
So, I guess you wanna
shoot it yourself?

16:49.590 --> 16:50.500
Of course!

16:50.630 --> 16:52.630
Well, do you have any
Death Ray experience?

16:52.760 --> 16:54.170
I mean, those things can kick.

16:54.300 --> 16:56.220
Is the great Brock Samson jealous...

16:56.340 --> 16:58.300
of my super sweet Death Ray?

16:58.430 --> 17:00.050
- Kinda.
- Tough tiddlywinks!

17:00.180 --> 17:01.390
Fire her up!

17:06.440 --> 17:08.560
This floor is laser trip-wired.

17:08.690 --> 17:10.060
We have to find an alternate route.

17:10.190 --> 17:12.730
Yeah, maybe over a shark tank
or something.

17:12.859 --> 17:16.490
Yeah, you go off and meet your Maker
while 24 and I keep going this way.

17:16.609 --> 17:19.200
Knock it off, you guys.
It's starting to get to me.

17:19.319 --> 17:20.490
You still don't get it.

17:20.619 --> 17:22.910
24 and I have been on, like,
1 ,000 missions.

17:23.040 --> 17:25.369
We've been shot at, dipped in acid.

17:25.500 --> 17:27.790
Brock Samson hit me with a car.

17:27.920 --> 17:29.830
Drove right into my kidney. Here I am.

17:29.960 --> 17:32.630
Yeah, we could walk across this floor
and nothing would hit us.

17:32.760 --> 17:35.800
But then this huge log would swing down
and take your head off.

17:35.920 --> 17:37.010
Here... what's your name?

17:37.130 --> 17:39.430
- Henchman Number One.
- See, you are nameless.

17:39.550 --> 17:42.850
I'm Scott Hall.
My name is Scott Hall, OK?

17:42.970 --> 17:44.520
Nope. Won't help.

17:44.640 --> 17:45.980
Yeah, now it's just pathos.

17:46.100 --> 17:47.640
When you're dying in my lap, and I'm all...

17:47.770 --> 17:51.270
"Scott, Scott! Don't you quit on us!
Don't you dare!"

17:51.400 --> 17:54.980
You just made your
unavoidable death more pathetic.

17:55.110 --> 17:58.320
Fuck it.
Nothing's gonna happen to me.

17:59.160 --> 18:00.700
Well?

18:00.820 --> 18:02.330
Oh, come on!

18:07.000 --> 18:09.250
Six miles and closing fast!

18:09.370 --> 18:12.170
Trajectory target at X-1 5, Y-23!

18:12.290 --> 18:14.460
Blind fire available at two miles!

18:14.590 --> 18:15.880
Re-targeting!

18:17.050 --> 18:20.130
I have an intruder alert,
museum floor!

18:20.260 --> 18:22.800
Who puts a museum
on a hidden island fortress?

18:22.930 --> 18:25.640
Jonas, there's an intruder
in the museum!

18:25.770 --> 18:28.140
What?
Zapruder films in the museum?

18:28.270 --> 18:31.730
No! There's someone in the museum.

18:31.860 --> 18:34.020
Can't be. We're closed on the weekends!

18:34.150 --> 18:37.360
I'll check it out unless you feel like
letting me shoot that thing.

18:37.490 --> 18:39.360
No chance, Samson.

18:52.460 --> 18:56.050
I've always wanted to try this
but the opportunity never comes up!

18:56.170 --> 18:59.260
Poor guy missed out on, like
the greatest cliché in deception.

18:59.380 --> 19:00.970
But getting killed by Brock...

19:01.090 --> 19:02.930
that's a glorious way
for a henchman to go.

19:03.050 --> 19:04.470
You guys are henchmen, aye?

19:04.600 --> 19:05.970
Aah! Jeez, you're real!

19:06.100 --> 19:07.350
I used to be.

19:07.470 --> 19:10.480
Say, you gents don't carry
dart guns, do ya?

19:10.600 --> 19:12.440
Yeah...tranquilizers. Gonna rat us out?

19:12.560 --> 19:14.610
Not if you give me a hit of dart.

19:14.730 --> 19:17.190
You wanna be shot
with a tranquilizer dart?

19:17.320 --> 19:19.110
I have the dart monkey
on me back.

19:19.240 --> 19:20.150
Just one, man.

19:20.280 --> 19:22.030
After this one, I'm going straight.

19:22.160 --> 19:25.120
I just need that one last dart.

19:25.240 --> 19:26.620
Just one more.

19:26.740 --> 19:29.700
OK, but dude,
you know this is creepy.

19:29.830 --> 19:32.750
Right in the neck,
if you don't mind.

19:33.750 --> 19:36.420
Yes!

19:36.550 --> 19:39.260
It's like getting sucked off
by an angel...

19:39.380 --> 19:43.340
a sweet angel
with a tranquilizer.

19:49.060 --> 19:50.390
Steady...

19:50.520 --> 19:52.560
Steady...

19:52.690 --> 19:54.310
Get ready to light that thing!

19:56.520 --> 19:58.400
He's almost on you!

20:08.620 --> 20:10.750
Now!

20:49.490 --> 20:51.830
So, I guess we're retired again.

20:51.950 --> 20:54.620
Oh, and I have to move
back in with my dad.

20:54.750 --> 20:56.370
It's so humiliating.

20:57.540 --> 20:58.710
Hello?

20:58.840 --> 21:01.130
21 and 24,
prepare for pickup...

21:01.260 --> 21:02.840
at drop point Alpha-7.

21:02.970 --> 21:03.880
Monarch...
Monarch?

21:04.010 --> 21:05.220
We thought you died!

21:05.340 --> 21:08.010
What? That midget shot
his cannon into a cloud.

21:08.140 --> 21:09.100
How do you not know that?

21:09.220 --> 21:10.720
You dinks are the ones who installed...

21:10.850 --> 21:12.100
the video surveillance patch.

21:12.220 --> 21:14.060
We did? Oh.

21:14.180 --> 21:16.270
That's what the Dark S-7 Maneuver is?

21:16.400 --> 21:20.230
I hate that you're my best men. Honestly.

21:20.360 --> 21:22.780
Hey, what happened
to henchman One?

21:22.900 --> 21:24.610
Death by Samson.

21:24.740 --> 21:27.070
Perfect! We shall avenge his death!

21:27.200 --> 21:30.160
We raid the Venture Compound at dawn!

21:30.280 --> 21:31.990
Sweet! Over and out.

21:32.120 --> 21:35.000
- So we saved the day?
- I think so.
