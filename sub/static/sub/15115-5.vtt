00:03.408 --> 00:05.335
Michelle, Prince Charming
here for you again.

00:05.410 --> 00:06.511
What?

00:06.512 --> 00:07.880
<i>Oh, come on!</i>
<i>He's sweet and harmless.</i>

00:07.881 --> 00:10.683
<i>Every time he comes to town he brings</i>
<i>you things and buys you dinner.</i>

00:10.724 --> 00:11.683
Marry me.

00:11.724 --> 00:13.683
Well. this is it.
Our home.

00:13.684 --> 00:15.883
- Oh, I could stay here forever.
- That's the plan.

00:15.884 --> 00:16.583
Who's this?

00:16.884 --> 00:17.783
Mom!

00:17.784 --> 00:18.783
Yes, Mom!

00:18.867 --> 00:20.835
Hubbell was in a car accident last night.

00:20.868 --> 00:22.735
- Madame Fanny's Hubbell?
- Yep.

00:22.769 --> 00:23.903
- Bad?
- Yep.

00:23.937 --> 00:25.771
- And...?
- He's...

00:26.974 --> 00:28.975
- What? He's what?
- You know.

00:29.009 --> 00:30.943
- I don't know.
- Oh my God, he's dead?

00:30.978 --> 00:32.979
- Paperwork?
- Just some signatures.

00:33.013 --> 00:35.781
- Signature for what?
- For the will transfer.

00:35.816 --> 00:38.150
I thought he told you.
He called me on the way back from Vegas.

00:38.185 --> 00:40.786
- He left everything to you.
- Fanny: <i>Homeless?</i>

00:40.821 --> 00:42.755
- You're not homeless.
- Talk about the fact that I'm jobless?

00:42.789 --> 00:45.791
- You're not jobless!
- Fanny: As of today, you own the ballet school.

00:45.826 --> 00:47.960
<i>No, you own the school.</i>
<i>I just own the building</i>

00:47.995 --> 00:49.795
<i>and the land the school</i>
<i>is sitting on.</i>

00:49.830 --> 00:51.030
Are you leaving?

00:52.064 --> 00:53.165
I don't know.

00:53.200 --> 00:55.134
<i>This is</i>

00:55.168 --> 00:57.036

I can't hear you.

01:44.151 --> 01:47.720
( Softly ) There's
something in my bed.

01:47.754 --> 01:49.989
Oh. Well, just give him
some cab fare

01:50.023 --> 01:51.991
- and change the locks.
- It's not a man.

01:52.025 --> 01:54.026
- It's a thing.
- A thing?

01:54.061 --> 01:55.928
- <i>A nature thing.</i>
<i>- Like a Tsunami?</i>

01:55.963 --> 01:58.965
No, like a pointy,
furry, long-tailed thing

01:58.999 --> 02:00.900
- with little hand-claws.
- Like a rat?

02:00.934 --> 02:03.736
- <i>Oh my God, is it a rat?</i>
<i>- I don't know what it is.</i>

02:03.770 --> 02:05.871
- I'm asking you if it's a rat.
- <i>I hate rats.</i>

02:05.906 --> 02:08.640
- Just get out of bed.
- I can't. I can't move.

02:08.675 --> 02:10.876
- <i>Michelle.</i>
<i>- I'm paralyzed with rat fear.</i>

02:10.911 --> 02:13.079
- Just take a picture.
- For posterity?!

02:13.113 --> 02:16.048
Take a picture of the thing
with your cellphone

02:16.083 --> 02:18.084
and send it to me
so I can see what it is

02:18.118 --> 02:21.721
- and end this conversation.
- Oh. O-o-o-- okay, that's a good idea.

02:21.755 --> 02:23.789
- Should I say "cheese"?
- Now you're making jokes?

02:23.824 --> 02:25.791
Sorry, I toured with
David Brenner for a year.

02:25.826 --> 02:27.727
- ( Softly ) Okay.
- ( Beeps )

02:32.032 --> 02:33.966
- ( Camera shutter clicks )
- Ugh.

02:34.001 --> 02:36.002
( Beeps )

02:36.036 --> 02:37.737
Okay, I just
sent it to you.

02:37.771 --> 02:39.005
( Beeps )

02:40.807 --> 02:42.742
- It's not a rat.
- Oh good.

02:42.776 --> 02:44.110
- It's a possum...
- <i>Oh.</i>

02:44.144 --> 02:46.679
...which is basically
a really big rat.

02:46.713 --> 02:48.748
Okay, have you ever worked
at a crisis hotline before?

02:48.782 --> 02:51.083
- 'Cause you got mad people skills.
- It won't hurt you.

02:51.118 --> 02:53.686
They only attack
if they're in heat.

02:53.720 --> 02:54.987
Or is that bears?

02:55.022 --> 02:56.922
I don't know.
I'm not Jack Hanna.

02:56.957 --> 02:58.991
Grab a frying pan
and bang it on the head.

02:59.026 --> 03:00.993
Okay, first of all,
I don't cook.

03:01.028 --> 03:03.095
And second of all, I'm not
banging it on its head,

03:03.130 --> 03:06.666
'cause if I do and his giant
rat friends get wind of it,

03:06.700 --> 03:09.835
they'll start circulating giant rat
wanted posters with my face on 'em,

03:09.870 --> 03:12.038
and I could wake up one morning
and find myself surrounded

03:12.072 --> 03:13.906
by a giant rat posse.
Come save me.

03:13.940 --> 03:16.042
- I'm hanging up now.
- To come save me?

03:16.076 --> 03:17.777
Yes, I'll be right there.

03:18.979 --> 03:20.713
( Beeps )

03:20.747 --> 03:21.947
She's not coming
to save me.

Box 1.
Fritzy's Cleaners, 162.

03:55.782 --> 03:57.883
- 162.
- It moved and I fled.

03:57.918 --> 03:59.885
- Box 2.
- Do you have any peanut butter?

03:59.920 --> 04:01.987
Handyman, 88.14.

04:02.022 --> 04:03.923
- We need a cheaper handyman
- I was thinking

04:03.957 --> 04:05.758
if I put some peanut butter
on some crackers

04:05.792 --> 04:07.026
and then stick it
just outside the front door,

04:07.060 --> 04:08.961
I could coax him out and have
a place to live again.

04:08.995 --> 04:11.097
- Stationary store...
- You don't have any peanut butter.

04:11.131 --> 04:13.699
- ...99.75.
- ...or crackers.

04:13.734 --> 04:16.101
- No, wait-- 76.
- or food.

04:16.136 --> 04:18.803
No. 75.

04:18.839 --> 04:20.740
I'm sorry.
Is that a five or a six?

04:20.774 --> 04:23.909
- It's a three.
- Oh. 99.73.

04:23.944 --> 04:25.778
You think a possum
would like powdered yeast?

04:25.812 --> 04:27.880
- What are you doing in my kitchen?
- I told you.

04:27.914 --> 04:30.049
- Ooh, nuts. Do they like nuts?
- Who?

04:30.083 --> 04:33.652
- Michelle has a visitor in her bedroom.
- Already?

04:33.687 --> 04:34.887
It's a possum.
He's in my bed.

04:35.421 --> 04:37.757
Oh. Oh, that's horrifying.

04:37.791 --> 04:39.692
It is horrifying.
You know, truly,

04:39.726 --> 04:41.026
I can't go back in there
until he's gone.

04:41.061 --> 04:42.962
<i>Maybe I could bunk</i> <i>with you tonight?
</i> <i>What do you say?</i>

04:42.996 --> 04:44.764
We could practice
kissing our pillows,

04:44.798 --> 04:46.932
pull a "fast times at Richmond High"
with some carrot sticks.

04:46.967 --> 04:49.001
I never know what
you're talking about.

04:49.035 --> 04:51.871
- Neither does she.
- Hey, what's going on?

04:51.905 --> 04:54.840
- It's paying season.
- What's paying season?

04:54.875 --> 04:58.644
Twice a year, Truly and I
go through my bills,

04:58.678 --> 05:01.814
add up what's owed,
sort out who gets what,

05:01.848 --> 05:03.916
balance the books,
write the checks

05:03.950 --> 05:06.786
- and settle all my business accounts.
- I'm sorry. Clarify:

05:06.820 --> 05:08.854
You only pay
your bills twice a year?

05:08.889 --> 05:10.623
That's the way
we do it in paradise.

05:10.657 --> 05:12.858
Everyone has a paying season,
don't they, Truly?

05:12.893 --> 05:15.795
Uh-huh. Mine is when
the bills come in,

05:15.829 --> 05:17.897
but Fanny's system
works great too.

05:17.931 --> 05:21.867
I divide all my bills
into four hatboxes.

05:21.902 --> 05:25.704
Box #1 is for people who have
to get paid, like electric.

05:25.739 --> 05:28.040
You only pay your
electric bill twice a year?

05:28.074 --> 05:30.609
Well, I've known
Fred forever.

05:30.644 --> 05:32.945
Box #2 is for people
who should get paid.

05:32.979 --> 05:34.747
They've earned it,
they've waited,

05:34.781 --> 05:37.750
so they get first shot
after people in box #1,

05:37.784 --> 05:40.052
- the ones that have to get paid.
- Huh.

05:40.086 --> 05:43.856
Now box #3 is for people
who might get paid.

05:43.890 --> 05:47.726
<i>Maybe they were too aggressive</i> <i>in their
billing practices</i> <i>or rude to deal with.</i>

05:47.761 --> 05:49.728
Whatever the reason,
they need to wait

05:49.763 --> 05:51.664
until the other accounts
are settled,

05:51.698 --> 05:53.933
and then if there's anything left
over, we'll see what we can do.

05:53.967 --> 05:57.036
Now this last box--
we're not sure what's in here.

05:57.070 --> 05:59.605
There are a lot of things
that might be receipts

05:59.639 --> 06:01.707
or they might be trash,
but we're keeping them

06:01.741 --> 06:03.909
in case we get audited.

06:03.944 --> 06:06.779
Every day in your house is like
a Kristen Wiig film festival.

06:06.813 --> 06:07.947
Go away now.
We're busy.

06:07.981 --> 06:09.882
Okay fine,
but I'm taking the nuts.

06:09.916 --> 06:11.917
These nuts.
You two can stay where you are.

06:16.857 --> 06:18.023
Two-tops shall
remain two-tops.

06:18.058 --> 06:19.692
Four-tops shall remain
four-tops.

06:19.726 --> 06:20.893
No two at a four,
no four at a two--

06:20.927 --> 06:22.728
mainly 'cause
there aren't enough chairs.

06:22.762 --> 06:24.697
- Did you get that joke?
- Got it.

06:24.731 --> 06:26.799
Good. Now most places tell their
employees they must wash their hands

06:26.833 --> 06:28.667
every time they use
the bathroom. Not me.

06:28.702 --> 06:30.836
I'm more of an every-20-minutes
guy myself. See this?

06:30.871 --> 06:33.038
- Ouch.
- Yup, chapped raw. Bleed at night.

06:33.073 --> 06:35.007
And that's not from plowing
fields, my friend.

06:35.041 --> 06:37.009
- You know what that's from?
- Frequent hand washing.

06:37.043 --> 06:38.711
Frequent hand washing.
Exactly.

06:38.745 --> 06:40.579
Now I can't vouch for the guys
back there in the kitchen,

06:40.614 --> 06:42.581
but up here I promise you can
eat right off our hands.

06:42.616 --> 06:44.750
- Or with them.
- I'll handle the jokes for now.

06:44.784 --> 06:46.886
- Sorry.
- Listen, wipe that table, will you?

06:46.920 --> 06:48.921
I don't wipe tables now
that I'm a senior manager.

06:48.955 --> 06:51.857
Now each table is named after
a college I want to go to.

06:51.892 --> 06:54.026
The bigger the table, the more
I want to go to that college.

06:54.060 --> 06:56.629
Amherst.
This is Berkeley.

06:56.663 --> 06:58.731
You see that table
over there? Table six?

06:58.765 --> 07:00.799
<i>Seats eight. Harvard.</i>

07:01.334 --> 07:03.569
I really want
to go to Harvard.

07:03.603 --> 07:05.571
Groups of three,
my section.

07:05.605 --> 07:07.606
Be right with you guys.
Groups of two, your section;

07:07.641 --> 07:08.941
Unless it looks like
they're on their first date,

07:08.975 --> 07:10.743
then that's gonna
be my section.

07:10.777 --> 07:12.645
Any group of kids that look
like they're coming in

07:12.679 --> 07:14.713
to share a plate of fries--
your section.

07:14.748 --> 07:16.882
Anyone with yoga pants--
your section.

07:16.917 --> 07:18.918
Any women coming in
with shopping bags

07:18.952 --> 07:20.719
and look like they're settling
in for the afternoon

07:20.754 --> 07:22.655
to have some drinks,
complain about their husbands--

07:22.689 --> 07:24.623
- your section.
- You're learning.

07:24.658 --> 07:27.993
Now part of your job--
the dumpster jump.

07:28.028 --> 07:30.829
I'm sorry. What?

07:32.832 --> 07:34.566
If the trash is up
too high,

07:34.601 --> 07:36.635
the top won't close and the
garbage truck won't pick it up,

07:36.670 --> 07:38.804
so someone has to go inside
and squash the trash,

07:38.838 --> 07:41.640
which is best accomplished
by a repetitive jumping motion.

07:41.675 --> 07:45.044
- Up and down.
- You want me to get in the dumpster?

07:45.078 --> 07:47.746
No, I don't want you to.
It's just part of the job.

07:47.781 --> 07:49.748
- Now?
- Yeah.

07:49.783 --> 07:52.818
Oh. Okay.

08:07.968 --> 08:09.768
- Could you--
- What if I'm not here?

08:09.803 --> 08:11.837
What if I'm off at Harvard?
What then?

08:12.839 --> 08:14.707
Right.

08:14.741 --> 08:16.675
( Grunts )

08:16.710 --> 08:18.610
( Shrieks )

08:18.645 --> 08:21.013
Good. Now jump.

08:26.953 --> 08:29.888
Yeah. No,
give it some oomph.

08:32.058 --> 08:33.759
More oomph. Come on.
You're a dancer, right?

08:33.793 --> 08:35.760
Just give it some height.

08:38.030 --> 08:40.899
Yeah, there you go.
Ah.

08:42.001 --> 08:44.636
So do you have
a boyfriend?

08:50.176 --> 08:52.945
- Ooh, so cute. Aids?
- Whales.

08:52.979 --> 08:54.747
- Nice.
- Yeah, "Save the whales."

08:54.781 --> 08:57.616
It's my cause, my thing.
It defines me.

08:57.650 --> 08:59.051
So you're showing your
support for the environment

08:59.085 --> 09:01.653
by wearing synthetic rubber
bands made from petroleum--

09:01.688 --> 09:03.756
a valuable natural resource
that you're wasting--

09:03.790 --> 09:06.525
- to make a statement?
- Well, they're pink.

09:06.559 --> 09:08.861
- What's that smell?
- I know, all of a sudden it totally stinks.

09:08.895 --> 09:10.963
- Are there horses on the property?
- No, it's not that.

09:10.997 --> 09:13.665
- Did the septic tank back up?
- No, it's more of a smell

09:13.700 --> 09:15.100
- like when my mom makes chili.
- Oh, you're right.

09:15.135 --> 09:17.836
- It smells like a Super Bowl party.
- But an <i>old</i> Super Bowl party

09:17.871 --> 09:20.939
from like the first Super Bowl and it's all
covered in burnt microwave popcorn.

09:20.974 --> 09:22.908
I took
four showers, okay?

09:22.942 --> 09:25.077
- It won't come out.
- Oh my God, it's you?

09:25.111 --> 09:27.746
Yes, it's me. It's me.
The smell is me.

09:27.781 --> 09:31.050
- But what happened?
- I got a job at the Oyster Bar.

09:31.084 --> 09:33.018
People have to work.
The economy is bad.

09:33.053 --> 09:34.853
- Watch the news.
- ( Girls cough )

09:34.888 --> 09:36.755
I'll go change downwind.

09:36.790 --> 09:38.857
- ( Sprays )
- ( Girls gag )

09:38.892 --> 09:40.993
- Oh God.
- ( Coughs )

09:44.107 --> 09:45.065
- Hey.
- God!

09:45.197 --> 09:46.965
- What's going on in there?
- I--

09:46.999 --> 09:49.000
Wait...
Sorry, manners.

09:49.034 --> 09:51.936
Sal Russano, proprietor of
the local dancewear store--

09:51.971 --> 09:54.038
- "Sal's Dancy Pants." Nice to meet you.
- Nice to--

09:54.073 --> 09:57.175
I'm aware that Fanny's
paying season starts today,

09:57.209 --> 09:59.010
and I just wanna know
what box I'm in...

09:59.044 --> 10:01.045
- Oh.
- ...Because for the last three years I've been

10:01.080 --> 10:03.248
in the might-get-paid box.
As it turns out, I never got paid.

10:03.282 --> 10:05.917
Well, to be fair, you were
in the might-get-paid box.

10:05.951 --> 10:08.953
I'm just saying if I get put into
the might-get-paid box again,

10:08.988 --> 10:11.789
- I have to be paid.
- Then you'll be in the have-to-get-paid box.

10:11.824 --> 10:13.791
Look, I don't care
how the system works.

10:13.826 --> 10:15.159
I want my money.
I have expenses.

10:15.194 --> 10:17.228
And I swear to God
if I don't get paid this year,

10:17.263 --> 10:20.031
something's gonna happen.
You hear me? You tell Fanny

10:20.065 --> 10:22.934
if I wind up in the wrong box,
I'm gonna come down there

10:22.968 --> 10:25.870
and I'm gonna rip the toe shoes
right off those little girls.

10:25.904 --> 10:28.039
- Wow.
- Mid-jete, they're coming off.

10:28.073 --> 10:30.975
Okay, will do.
I'll tell her right after I call 911.

10:31.010 --> 10:33.177
- You're a dancer.
- What?

10:33.212 --> 10:36.114
- You look like a dancer from the back.
- Uh, yeah, I am.

10:36.148 --> 10:39.150
I can always tell by the tush.
Dancers have a very specific tush,

10:39.184 --> 10:41.853
and different kinds of dancers
have different kinds of tushes.

10:41.887 --> 10:44.822
- Really?
- Oh yeah, tap dancer's tush is always higher,

10:44.857 --> 10:46.157
'cause they keep jumping
up and down all the time.

10:46.191 --> 10:48.993
Ballet dancers have
a nice centered tush.

10:49.028 --> 10:51.195
Fosse's got
a very contoured tush--

10:51.230 --> 10:53.231
a lot of side indentation.

10:53.265 --> 10:57.869
But you-- you have
a sort of multi-tush.

10:57.903 --> 11:01.005
I see some ballet,
a little tap,

11:01.040 --> 11:05.777
maybe some modern.
That's a good trained tush.

11:05.811 --> 11:07.979
- Thank you.
- What are you gonna do with that tush?

11:08.013 --> 11:10.081
- Rent it out for functions?
- You live here now.

11:10.115 --> 11:11.849
- Yes.
- No dance companies here.

11:11.884 --> 11:13.851
- I know.
- No Broadway, no Regional.

11:13.886 --> 11:16.154
We had "stomp" here once, but
that's a very specific thing.

11:16.188 --> 11:18.056
Ever dance
with a trash-can cover?

11:18.090 --> 11:20.858
- No.
- Well, then unless that tush can type,

11:20.893 --> 11:22.927
- you should be dancing.
- I never said I wasn't.

11:22.961 --> 11:24.829
You're not gonna have
that tush forever.

11:24.863 --> 11:26.130
Can we talk about
my knees for a while?

11:26.165 --> 11:30.101
Oh, and I sense some frustration
with this topic of conversation.

11:30.135 --> 11:32.170
- Do ya?
- I'm done.

11:32.704 --> 11:34.105
But just remember--

11:34.439 --> 11:36.874
a tush is
a terrible thing to waste.

11:37.876 --> 11:39.811
Come by the store.

11:39.845 --> 11:41.813
First time, 50% off.

11:41.847 --> 11:43.948
- Thanks.
- Sure.

11:43.982 --> 11:46.918
- Remember to tel Fanny.
- Mid-jete,

11:46.952 --> 11:48.219
shoes ripped off.
Got it.

11:50.222 --> 11:52.824
Fanny, there's an ass-man
in your bushes

11:52.858 --> 11:54.258
who wants to know
what box he's in.

11:54.293 --> 11:56.060
Could that sound
any dirtier?

11:56.095 --> 11:58.096
<i>( Wind gusts )</i>

11:59.965 --> 12:01.833
I found your phone bill.

12:01.867 --> 12:03.868
I can't reach it.
Is it important?

12:03.902 --> 12:05.770
It's all important.
They're bills.

12:05.804 --> 12:08.005
I told you we should start
putting this all on a computer.

12:08.040 --> 12:10.908
Oh, so now this is my fault?
Who opened the door?

12:10.943 --> 12:13.244
It's hot and you won't
put on the air conditioning!

12:13.278 --> 12:16.781
<i>( Wind gusts )</i>
<i>Oh! Oh, grab 'em!</i>

12:16.815 --> 12:19.884
Oh! Oh, for God's sake.

12:19.918 --> 12:21.953
Half of march is
behind the TV.

12:21.987 --> 12:24.789
I'm starting to wonder how you
ever made a profit at Sparkles.

12:24.823 --> 12:27.091
( Angrily ) I have a
computer at Sparkles.

12:27.126 --> 12:28.192
Calm down, I'll help.

12:28.227 --> 12:30.094
Just remind me
what goes in which hatbox

12:30.129 --> 12:32.897
and we'll have this system up
and not working in no time.

12:32.931 --> 12:34.866
- What time is it?
- Please say time for your meds.

12:34.900 --> 12:36.067
I have to go.
I have a class to teach.

12:37.202 --> 12:38.970
- What?
- Yov can't just leave.

12:39.004 --> 12:41.139
- Truly can handle this.
- The place is a wreck.

12:41.173 --> 12:43.875
She's fine.
You're fine.

12:43.909 --> 12:46.210
- See? She's fine.
- She's not fine!

12:47.045 --> 12:49.213
- Look at her eyes. She's the girl who hides
- <i>( Door opens )</i>

12:49.248 --> 12:51.249
- the chicken under her bed in "Girl, Interrupted."
- <i>( Door closes )</i>

12:51.283 --> 12:55.119
There's too many.
There's too many!

12:55.154 --> 12:59.123
Oh, to stay, to go?
To stay, to go-- gotta go.

13:00.159 --> 13:03.795
Yo, flowers,
these are your finances.

13:03.829 --> 13:05.129
You need to start
taking things seriously.

13:05.164 --> 13:07.198
Since when do you have
such business acumen?

13:07.232 --> 13:10.067
Since some guy named Sal
threatened to rip the toe shoes

13:10.102 --> 13:11.903
off your students
if he doesn't get paid.

13:11.937 --> 13:14.205
Sal's not gonna do that.
Sal's niece is in my class.

13:14.239 --> 13:16.941
- Sal's a pussycat.
- Well, pussycat's mad.

13:16.975 --> 13:18.810
In fact,
half this town is mad.

13:18.844 --> 13:20.812
Gilda at the mini-mart
won't sell me a slushee

13:20.846 --> 13:22.980
till she finds out if she's
a must, a might or a maybe.

13:23.015 --> 13:25.249
- Just pay people, Fanny.
- It'll all get sorted out.

13:25.284 --> 13:28.019
- Fanny, how much do you owe?
- That's what I'm figuring out.

13:28.053 --> 13:30.121
- How much in your account?
- Before or after?

13:30.155 --> 13:33.191
- Before or after what?
- Before or after I pay some of the people I owe.

13:33.225 --> 13:35.827
- Or all the people you owe.
- That's not gonna happen.

13:35.861 --> 13:37.862
- That's why I have hat boxes.
- Okay, that's it.

13:37.896 --> 13:40.164
I'm going to go in there right now and
I'm going to find an accountant--

13:40.199 --> 13:44.068
a real one with a desk and a
degree who you can't make cry.

13:44.102 --> 13:46.103
Oh, Truly cries
over cloud cover.

13:46.138 --> 13:48.105
- You have to ignore her.
- Go teach, Fanny.

13:48.140 --> 13:50.975
- I got this.
- I'm not going to an accountant.

13:51.009 --> 13:52.977
I'm not giving up
my hatboxes.

13:55.809 --> 13:58.277
So the parents say it's cool
you guys come over Saturday night.

13:58.509 --> 13:59.777
- I'm there.
- Ginny?

14:00.009 --> 14:02.277
Sounds great.
Just let me check with my mom.

14:02.309 --> 14:03.777
Ginny...

14:03.900 --> 14:05.935
We all know
that's not your mom.

14:05.969 --> 14:09.038
- Yes, it is.   - There's a red heart
emoticon next to "hiya."

14:09.072 --> 14:12.007
Seriously? You have to check
everything with Josh?

14:12.042 --> 14:14.310
- Not everything.
- Everything. Every single damn thing.

14:14.345 --> 14:16.279
Well, Saturday is
a big day for us, okay?

14:16.313 --> 14:19.449
We have to do chores, pick up
potting soil for my mom's shed,

14:19.483 --> 14:21.417
get stamps, take Grandma
to the button store.

14:21.452 --> 14:25.421
- You are 100.
- Boo, your table.

14:25.456 --> 14:28.224
Okay, we're good.
We'll do our CSIs on Sunday.

14:28.259 --> 14:30.393
You guys have been together
since, what, third grade?

14:30.427 --> 14:32.228
Second--
Miss Marsh's class.

14:32.263 --> 14:34.497
First day he sat next to me
and by lunch that was it.

14:34.565 --> 14:36.432
- We were soulmates.
- In second grade?

14:36.467 --> 14:38.401
So what if I found my soulmate
in the second grade?

14:38.435 --> 14:40.336
It's romantic.
And convenient.

14:40.371 --> 14:42.505
Very practical.
One less thing for me to worry about.

14:42.539 --> 14:44.507
- It's so weird.
- You like Josh.

14:44.541 --> 14:46.309
I do like Josh.
It's still weird.

14:46.343 --> 14:48.611
Yeah, who sticks with a decision
they made in the second grade?

14:48.646 --> 14:51.214
I can't even stick with
decisions I made yesterday.

14:51.248 --> 14:53.349
- Isn't that my shirt?
- You gave it to me.

14:53.384 --> 14:54.651
- I want it back. See?
- <i>( Bell dings )</i>

14:54.685 --> 14:57.387
- All right, let's hear it.
- Hear what?

14:57.421 --> 15:00.490
Yes, the jeans have pleats and I'm
wearing a button the size of my head.

15:00.524 --> 15:03.293
- We're just here to be supportive.
- Yeah, and as pleats go,

15:03.327 --> 15:05.261
they're not
that pleaty.

15:05.296 --> 15:07.263
- Mm-hmm.
- Seriously, Boo,

15:07.298 --> 15:08.498
it's not that big a deal.
You look fine.

15:08.532 --> 15:10.500
Plus the whole place smells
like rancid onions, anyway,

15:10.534 --> 15:13.336
- so you totally blend in.
- Uh, thanks.

15:13.370 --> 15:16.172
You're welcome.
Now that that's behind us,

15:16.206 --> 15:18.608
let's talk.
This little job of yours--

15:18.642 --> 15:20.543
- what's in it for us?
- Meaning?

15:20.577 --> 15:23.279
We are young women with no
monetary stability at the moment

15:23.314 --> 15:25.448
and yet are so so hungry.

15:25.482 --> 15:27.483
Alyssa Milano cries
when she sees us.

15:27.518 --> 15:29.619
I can probably
sneak you guys some fries.

15:29.653 --> 15:32.188
- Onion rings?
- Jeff counts the rings in the back.

15:32.222 --> 15:34.424
- What about the mozzarella sticks?
- Possibility.

15:34.458 --> 15:37.160
- What about the clams?
- ( Whispers ) You so do not want the clams.

15:37.194 --> 15:39.562
How's this? Fries, breadsticks and
hide some chicken strips in there.

15:39.596 --> 15:42.565
Ginny: <i>No chicken for me.
</i> <i>We're vegetarians now.</i>

15:42.599 --> 15:45.535
- "We"?
- Yes, me and Josh-- we're vegetarians.

15:45.569 --> 15:47.537
- Since when?
- Since Josh's cholesterol went up.

15:47.571 --> 15:49.505
Wait, Josh has
high cholesterol?

15:49.540 --> 15:51.607
- He's 15.
- It's not high high,

15:51.642 --> 15:54.377
but it ticked up slightly and he
does have a family history of it.

15:54.411 --> 15:56.446
My mistake.
You're 200.

15:59.616 --> 16:02.318
Oh my God.

16:02.353 --> 16:04.520
( Melanie gasps )
Whoa!

16:04.555 --> 16:07.323
No way. Boo, when did Godot
get back from Costa Rica?

16:07.358 --> 16:08.591
- Yesterday.
- And you didn't tell us?

16:08.625 --> 16:10.627
I didn't know
I was supposed to.

16:10.661 --> 16:12.028
Melanie: Oh, he's even cuter
than last year, isn't he?

16:12.763 --> 16:13.864
Way cuter.
Ginny, look.

16:13.898 --> 16:15.699
- No thanks.
- Oh, come on.

16:15.733 --> 16:17.868
Just 'cause you have a boyfriend,
you can't even look at a cute guy?

16:17.902 --> 16:20.670
That has nothing to do with it.
I don't think he's that cute.

16:20.705 --> 16:22.672
You are the worst liar
in the world.

16:22.707 --> 16:24.674
Melanie: Must be nice to having
your parents own a restaurant

16:24.709 --> 16:26.076
so you can just come
and go whenever you want.

16:26.610 --> 16:28.544
- For God's sake, Ginny.
- What?

16:28.579 --> 16:30.313
I mean, what's there
to look at, anyway?

16:30.347 --> 16:32.181
He's probably just standing
there with his shirt off.

16:32.216 --> 16:35.318
- Is his shirt off?
- Yeah.

16:40.391 --> 16:43.459
His shirt is off.
That's a God. He's a God.

16:43.494 --> 16:45.328
Nobody tell Josh
I just saw God.

16:45.362 --> 16:46.629
But I thought you
and Josh were soulmates.

16:46.663 --> 16:48.498
I met him in the second grade.
How the hell am I supposed

16:48.532 --> 16:50.366
to know if Josh is my soulmate,
for Christmas's sake?

16:50.401 --> 16:53.436
Girls, I hate to interrupt this
installment of Occupy Oyster Bar,

16:53.470 --> 16:55.571
but, Boo...
( Snaps fingers )

16:55.606 --> 16:59.409
- What's he snapping about?
- You don't want to know.

17:05.182 --> 17:06.582
Although the Bookkeeping
is unconventional,

17:06.617 --> 17:09.318
there's enough raw data to allow me
to analyze the capital allowances.

17:09.353 --> 17:12.422
Now if I could just find
the B2C debits or the B3Cs.

17:12.455 --> 17:14.290
Hey. You made me come here.

17:14.324 --> 17:16.459
Sorry, I'm back.
Continue with the--

17:16.492 --> 17:18.594
okay, now as for the all-important
capital expenditures,

17:18.628 --> 17:21.164
I've broken it into two parts.
We can't ignore

17:21.198 --> 17:23.132
the significance of these
expenditures on the net losses.

17:23.166 --> 17:25.268
( Crunching )

17:25.301 --> 17:27.369
- Very classy.
- Don't you agree?

17:27.404 --> 17:29.539
- I'm sorry.
- Am I talking too fast for you?

17:29.573 --> 17:32.308
No, not at all.
If anything I wish he'd talk faster.

17:32.342 --> 17:34.477
I mean, I'm just so bored.
Aren't you bored?

17:34.511 --> 17:37.380
I haven't understood a word he
said since, "hi, my name is Bob."

17:37.414 --> 17:39.315
Eric.
My name is Eric.

17:39.349 --> 17:42.218
- Oh.
- Okay.

17:42.252 --> 17:44.153
Let's just cut
to the chase.

17:44.188 --> 17:46.322
( Sighs )
I've gone through everything

17:46.356 --> 17:49.292
and your problem isn't just this
ludicrous organizational system.

17:49.326 --> 17:51.194
- Your problem is income.
- Meaning?

17:51.228 --> 17:54.163
You need some.
I mean, have you two sat down

17:54.198 --> 17:55.631
and thought about how
all this is going to work?

17:57.434 --> 17:59.235
Okay, let's start
with Michelle.

17:59.269 --> 18:00.403
Wait, how did
I get into trouble?

18:00.437 --> 18:02.338
Your husband
left you property,

18:02.372 --> 18:05.475
<i>two cars--</i> <i>one that
works--</i> <i>two small C.D.s,</i>

18:05.509 --> 18:07.577
a bank account that
if you manage very very wisely

18:07.611 --> 18:09.479
<i>will keep everything</i>
<i>going for a while,</i>

18:09.513 --> 18:12.281
but not forever.
You need some income.

18:12.316 --> 18:13.516
The ballet school
helps, right?

18:13.550 --> 18:15.351
Eric: <i>It would if they
had</i> <i>any students.</i>

18:15.385 --> 18:17.286
Whoa, what are
you talking about?

18:17.321 --> 18:19.589
That place is lousy with students.
Her classes are packed.

18:19.623 --> 18:22.258
Sorry... <i>paying</i> students,

18:22.292 --> 18:25.194
and according to these records,
most of the students do not pay.

18:25.229 --> 18:27.497
They don't?
Is he right about this, Fanny?

18:27.531 --> 18:30.566
I guess so. I'm assuming you
got us a decent accountant.

18:30.601 --> 18:32.301
I'm sorry.
Why don't they all pay?

18:32.336 --> 18:34.270
Well, there are
scholarships.

18:34.304 --> 18:36.339
- How many scholarships?
- I don't know exactly.

18:36.373 --> 18:38.574
- How many kids in the school?
- 75.

18:38.609 --> 18:40.576
- And how many students pay?
- Nine.

18:40.611 --> 18:42.478
- Nine?!
- Nine.

18:42.513 --> 18:45.281
- Nine? Nine?
- You sound like a German.

18:45.315 --> 18:47.250
- Nine?
- Are we done here?

18:47.284 --> 18:49.385
- Nine?
- Come on.

18:50.419 --> 18:53.189
- Nine!
- Say <i>auf wiedersehen</i>

18:53.223 --> 18:55.491
- to the nice accountant man.
- Nine?

18:56.560 --> 18:58.194
Nine?

19:03.546 --> 19:05.481
- Fanny.
- ( Snaps fingers )

19:05.515 --> 19:07.216
Fanny!

19:09.586 --> 19:12.521
- Fanny.
- Ow! Ow!

19:12.555 --> 19:14.323
I'm sorry,
but the whole way home

19:14.357 --> 19:16.258
you were listening to--
really?

19:16.292 --> 19:19.228
- I'm gonna make some tea.
- You weren't listening to anything.

19:19.262 --> 19:22.130
- There's no music on this.
- I haven't had a chance to fill it yet.

19:22.165 --> 19:25.234
The entire car ride you sat
there listening to nothing

19:25.268 --> 19:27.302
like you're 15
and no one asked you to prom.

19:27.337 --> 19:28.570
I wasn't in the mood
for a lecture.

19:28.605 --> 19:30.305
We need
to talk about this.

19:30.340 --> 19:32.107
And I'm still
not in the mood.

19:32.141 --> 19:34.476
Look, as far as I can tell,
the Woo twins are

19:34.511 --> 19:37.112
the only family
regularly paying for lessons.

19:37.146 --> 19:39.248
I'm an artist, okay?

19:39.282 --> 19:41.250
I don't think about money.

19:41.284 --> 19:44.286
I'm here to create art
and to create other artists.

19:44.320 --> 19:47.289
Any child who wants to dance
should be able to dance, period.

19:47.323 --> 19:50.492
I respect that, I do, but given
the fact that hardly anyone pays,

19:50.527 --> 19:52.528
they're technically
not dancers, they're squatters.

19:52.562 --> 19:55.397
Squatters who dance--
sound very Pina Bausch.

19:55.431 --> 19:57.599
You must like her--
she's German too.

19:57.634 --> 20:01.203
You're in the business of teaching
and should be paid for it.

20:01.237 --> 20:03.171
That's kind of how the whole
capitalist thing works.

20:03.206 --> 20:05.140
Well, how about
a girl like Sarah?

20:05.174 --> 20:06.608
Sarah's father lost
his job last month.

20:06.643 --> 20:08.544
If Sarah stops
going to classes,

20:08.578 --> 20:11.480
- she moves straight to crack.
- Really? Crack?

20:11.514 --> 20:13.549
There's nothing between
toe shoes and crack?

20:13.583 --> 20:16.351
- Not even a Grateful Dead album?
- It's my business.

20:16.386 --> 20:19.454
I know, but it's our
place, our home,

20:19.489 --> 20:21.423
and we need
to be able to pay for it.

20:21.457 --> 20:23.525
The dance studio simply
can't survive like it is.

20:23.560 --> 20:26.395
Hubbell's not around
to save the day any more.

20:29.666 --> 20:31.567
For either of us.

20:31.601 --> 20:34.436
So we need to start
thinking outside the box.

20:34.470 --> 20:37.539
<i>( Kettle whistling )</i> How about we add
some more classes? What about tap?

20:37.574 --> 20:40.542
I don't know.
It's so loud when they tap around.

20:40.577 --> 20:42.644
- It's tap.
- No tap.

20:42.679 --> 20:45.581
Okay, fine. Then how about
some non-dance classes,

20:45.615 --> 20:48.216
like zumba
or toddler classes?

20:48.251 --> 20:49.551
People love to spend
money on toddlers.

20:49.586 --> 20:52.554
Or dogs. You could teach one
of those dancing dog classes,

20:52.589 --> 20:55.524
like on "Letterman" where people
ballroom dance with their Dalmatians?

20:55.558 --> 20:57.626
I just lost the mature
person's upper hand, didn't I?

20:57.660 --> 21:01.163
- Big time.
- Okay, fine. No dogs. But the other idea--

21:01.197 --> 21:02.364
the one about
the more classes--

21:02.398 --> 21:03.498
that should
be a start, right?

21:03.533 --> 21:05.534
Sure, I'll just add
some baby classes...

21:05.568 --> 21:07.502
- Good.
- ...And some tap classes

21:07.537 --> 21:10.272
and some zumba classes
and some jazzercise

21:10.306 --> 21:12.507
and dancing with the oldies.
And I'll do all of this

21:12.542 --> 21:14.543
because I have so much
spare time and energy

21:14.577 --> 21:16.612
after teaching
30 classes a week.

21:17.646 --> 21:19.281
Unless you were thinking
of helping out.

21:19.315 --> 21:21.249
- Me?
- You could teach.

21:21.284 --> 21:23.251
Me? Teach?
No no no no no.

21:24.036 --> 21:25.587
- Why not?
- No no no no. I don't teach.

21:25.622 --> 21:27.556
Oh, I see.

21:27.590 --> 21:30.258
So your plan was to drag me
to the accountant

21:30.293 --> 21:32.227
to show me how much
money we don't have

21:32.261 --> 21:34.229
and then do absolutely
nothing about it.

21:34.263 --> 21:36.365
You want me to do
something about it?

21:36.399 --> 21:38.367
I will. I'll get
your students to pay.

21:38.401 --> 21:41.303
- What?
- You don't want to ask them, I will.

21:41.337 --> 21:43.538
I can be the bad cop.
You don't believe me?

21:44.037 --> 21:45.340
Ask Tia Zeleno.

21:45.341 --> 21:48.176
Tia and I were working together
on the Celine Dion show

21:48.211 --> 21:51.146
and she owed me $50.
Every week she said she didn't have it.

21:51.180 --> 21:53.415
She had all these excuses
as to why she couldn't get it.

21:53.449 --> 21:55.484
She sprained an ankle, rent,
kidney, blah blah blah.

21:55.518 --> 21:57.519
I wound up having to steal
her shoes and key her car,

21:57.553 --> 21:59.121
but that was
a whole boyfriend thing.

21:59.155 --> 22:00.555
Anyhow guess who got
her 50 bucks back?

22:00.590 --> 22:03.158
And boom!
That's how it's done!

22:03.192 --> 22:04.426
So what do you think?

22:05.460 --> 22:07.329
I think you'd be
a very good teacher.

22:08.498 --> 22:10.465
Sorry, I can't hear you
over the music.

22:10.500 --> 22:13.135
- Michelle--
- Ooh, it's a good song.

22:17.013 --> 22:18.712
(Whispers) - Do you see him?
(Normal voice) - No, do you?

22:18.713 --> 22:20.581
- Shh, not so loud.
- Sorry.

22:20.615 --> 22:22.716
- ( Whispers ) I'm sorry.
- Sit.

22:22.751 --> 22:25.386
Act casual.

22:26.488 --> 22:28.455
So how do I look?

22:28.490 --> 22:30.324
- Good. How do I look?
- Good.

22:30.358 --> 22:32.393
- Not as good as me, but good.
- Thanks.

22:32.427 --> 22:34.628
- Sure.
- Will you two please stop acting so obvious?

22:36.697 --> 22:37.731
What happened
to having a boyfriend?

22:37.766 --> 22:39.633
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

22:39.668 --> 22:41.602
I am just here
to hang out with you guys.

22:41.636 --> 22:43.504
- In that?
- What?

22:43.538 --> 22:46.473
Oh this? I'm seeing Josh later.
This is for Josh.

22:46.508 --> 22:48.642
This is all for Josh.

22:48.677 --> 22:50.611
Except for he only gets
to touch 20% of it.

22:50.645 --> 22:52.813
- Pshaw.
- Man: <i>Hey, ladies.</i>

22:52.847 --> 22:54.815
It's him, 3:00.

22:55.349 --> 22:57.718
<i>Oh, he's taller</i> <i>and
better-looking</i> <i>than yesterday.</i>

22:58.252 --> 23:01.822
- Bastard!
- I'm just happy he's finally wearing a shirt.

23:01.856 --> 23:03.190
So what's the plan?

23:03.224 --> 23:05.959
Yeah, what are we going to do
besides sit here and stare at him?

23:05.993 --> 23:09.196
Which, by the way, is exactly what that
table over there is already doing.

23:10.998 --> 23:12.265
Welcome
to the Oyster Bar.

23:12.300 --> 23:15.869
Here are your French fries that
you ordered before coming in.

23:15.903 --> 23:18.071
Now I'm going to tell you
about today's specials.

23:18.106 --> 23:19.806
Boo, you don't need
to do that.

23:19.841 --> 23:21.842
Would you like me to start
with the appetizers first?

23:21.876 --> 23:24.177
- Not really.
- We can't even afford the free fries.

23:24.212 --> 23:27.247
My manager's watching, so I am
going to act like you are all

23:27.281 --> 23:30.984
super interested in hearing every
one of today's delicious specials.

23:31.018 --> 23:34.121
'Kay?
Today we have shrimp parmesan,

23:34.155 --> 23:37.157
eggplant diablo, clams casino
and blackened mahi mahi.

23:37.191 --> 23:39.126
How about some waters
to go with the fries?

23:39.160 --> 23:40.994
- Mmm.
- And more ketchup.

23:41.028 --> 23:42.896
Coming right up!

23:44.932 --> 23:46.967
- You done?
- I'm good. Thanks, bro.

23:47.001 --> 23:49.002
Okay, we can take
a break from staring.

23:49.036 --> 23:51.271
So what? We're gonna sit here,
not staring until he comes over?

23:51.305 --> 23:53.807
'Cause then I'm not sure
what's gonna bring him over.

23:53.841 --> 23:55.175
At least if we do stare,
there's a chance

23:55.209 --> 23:57.177
he'll come over to tell us
not to be so creepy.

24:03.585 --> 24:06.587
I'm just having one of those
days that feels like a lifetime.

24:06.621 --> 24:10.291
Ever have one of those lifetime days filled
with crazy people who don't make any sense?

24:10.325 --> 24:11.492
- Uh--
- Well--

24:11.526 --> 24:13.694
Now I don't want to badmouth
anyone-- like Fanny--

24:13.728 --> 24:16.463
but some people are so crazy--
like Fanny--

24:16.498 --> 24:19.600
that they can't even see that they need to
take responsibility for their actions--

24:19.634 --> 24:22.369
like Fanny Fanny Fanny
Fanny Fanny, you know?

24:22.404 --> 24:25.372
- Why are you hanging out with us?
- 'Cause you have fries.

24:25.407 --> 24:28.375
And Fanny makes me want fries--
no, <i>need</i> fries.

24:28.410 --> 24:30.377
Believe me, you would be
willing to hang out with kids

24:30.412 --> 24:32.413
15 years younger than you
if you had my life lately.

24:32.447 --> 24:35.482
- 20 years younger.
- Let's say 17 and split the difference.

24:35.517 --> 24:37.785
Mm, these are so good.

24:41.323 --> 24:43.557
Why are you guys all dressed
for a <i>quinceanera?</i>

24:43.591 --> 24:45.726
- We're not.
- And you smell like oranges.

24:45.760 --> 24:48.562
We have fruit in our bags.
We're dancers, we eat fruit.

24:48.596 --> 24:51.598
Oh, come on, you can tell me,
I just shared.

24:53.435 --> 24:55.402
Wait, what are
you looking--

24:55.437 --> 24:57.271
Oh hey, what do you need?

24:57.305 --> 24:58.639
Aha.
Hello, moondoggy!

24:58.673 --> 25:01.375
Would you stop being so obvious?!
Turn around!

25:01.409 --> 25:02.643
Okay.
Who is he?

25:02.677 --> 25:06.513
- His name is Godot.
- So you're all "Waiting for Godot"?

25:07.682 --> 25:09.483
You're so lucky
you have fries.

25:09.517 --> 25:12.286
- He's Rico and Nina's son.
- He's back in town.

25:12.320 --> 25:14.588
He's been gone for months
traveling the world to surf.

25:14.622 --> 25:17.324
- And he's gorgeous.
- ( Sniffs )

25:17.359 --> 25:20.260
- Oh hi, Boo.
- How did you know it was me?

25:20.295 --> 25:23.530
- Uh, you know, you have a distinctive... walk.
- Smell.

25:23.565 --> 25:27.368
- No offense.
- I thought I blended in here!

25:28.737 --> 25:30.637
So what's your angle
with this guy?

25:30.672 --> 25:33.273
- What are your moves?
- We don't really have any.

25:33.308 --> 25:34.508
Oh, so you need me to help?
Cool.

25:34.542 --> 25:36.610
Okay, first thing to know
about guys like that

25:36.644 --> 25:40.347
is keep your sentences short.
Don't mention Tolstoy or math,

25:40.382 --> 25:43.517
it will just make you sad. Oh, and it really
helps if you have a car and an income,

25:43.551 --> 25:45.486
- 'cause that guy's got nothin'.
- Thanks.

25:45.520 --> 25:49.289
And he never will. No money, no car,
no thoughts of money or a car.

25:49.324 --> 25:52.292
Trust me, if there's a second set of
shorts at home, you've hit the jackpot.

25:52.327 --> 25:55.629
- Got it.
- Good. Oh, and he won't start showering till he's 30.

25:55.663 --> 25:58.432
Or he's been skunked.
Don't know why. It's a thing.

25:58.466 --> 26:01.268
Young pretty guys like that will
do anything to get out of bathing.

26:01.302 --> 26:03.337
- Johnny Depp moved to France.
- Could you please just go?

26:03.371 --> 26:04.705
Oh right yeah,
I'm cramping your style.

26:04.739 --> 26:06.607
Here, I'm gonna--
I'm just gonna--

26:07.675 --> 26:09.476
All right, surf's up!
Rock on!

26:09.511 --> 26:10.711
- Wear sunscreen.
- Leave!

26:11.746 --> 26:13.614
( Laughs )

26:17.485 --> 26:19.553
This is stupid.
I feel stupid.

26:19.587 --> 26:21.321
You're right.
We should just go.

26:21.356 --> 26:23.457
- We can't go.
- Well then, what are we gonna do?

26:23.491 --> 26:26.427
'Cause I don't want
to just keep sitting here.

26:27.662 --> 26:29.530
I bet I can get him
to give me a drink.

26:29.564 --> 26:31.732
- You can not.
- Just watch.

26:50.452 --> 26:51.519
( Sighs )

26:51.520 --> 26:52.519
Whoops.

26:52.554 --> 26:54.521
Can't take me anywhere.

27:03.831 --> 27:06.232
What do I want?

27:09.203 --> 27:12.038
Such a good
selection here.

27:12.073 --> 27:14.908
The place
across the street,

27:14.942 --> 27:18.845
they only have half as many
bottles as this place does,

27:18.879 --> 27:21.881
maybe even fewer bottles at
that other bar I've been to

27:21.916 --> 27:25.785
where they have
almost no bottles

27:25.820 --> 27:27.887
on the bottle shelf.

27:29.957 --> 27:33.026
You, however,
have a lot of bottles.

27:40.167 --> 27:41.401
Yep.

27:43.304 --> 27:45.171
So do you like
bartending?

27:48.242 --> 27:49.909
Do you want something
from the bar?

27:49.944 --> 27:54.314
Sure,
I'll have a, uh, a...

27:54.348 --> 27:57.150
A Temple Grandin.

27:57.184 --> 27:59.319
A what?

27:59.353 --> 28:02.055
Just a cup of cherries,
please.

28:08.696 --> 28:11.498
- Good?
- Thanks.

28:23.678 --> 28:26.547
- Those are cherries.
- I know, right?

28:26.581 --> 28:27.881
He's a lot of work.

28:40.394 --> 28:42.262
( Yelps )

28:43.464 --> 28:46.066
Ew.

28:46.100 --> 28:48.001
- ( Groans )
- What are you doing?

28:48.035 --> 28:51.237
- Dumpster jumping.
- For, like, a contest?

28:51.272 --> 28:54.040
No.
It's part of my job.

28:54.075 --> 28:56.042
- What job?
- My job.

28:56.077 --> 29:00.013
So you're like the trash-compactor
girl or something?

29:00.047 --> 29:01.948
Waitress.

29:01.982 --> 29:03.983
Are there customers
in there?

29:04.018 --> 29:06.119
No, just trash.

29:06.153 --> 29:08.321
Okay, I'm sorry,
I'm just trying to

29:08.355 --> 29:10.323
grasp the whole
concept here.

29:10.357 --> 29:13.059
Why are you doing that?

29:13.094 --> 29:15.328
- Well, Jeff said--
- ( Mimics buzzer )

29:15.362 --> 29:17.297
I'm sorry.
Jeff made you do that?

29:17.331 --> 29:19.966
- Douche.
- No, no douche.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.334
- Douchebag. Out.
- But--

29:21.368 --> 29:24.137
- get out of the trash, senorita.
- But Jeff's the senior manager.

29:24.171 --> 29:26.272
There is
no senior manager

29:26.307 --> 29:28.374
or junior manager
or manager.

29:28.409 --> 29:30.977
The parents aren't
really into labels. Out.

29:32.313 --> 29:36.049
Relax, I'll handle Jeff-- tell him
Harvard burned down and watch him cry.

29:36.083 --> 29:39.152
- He'd cry really hard.
- Yeah. You know about table six, right?

29:39.186 --> 29:40.954
- Ooh yes.
- Oh yeah.

29:40.988 --> 29:43.957
Ooh.
Thanks.

29:45.259 --> 29:47.293
- Gnarly.
- Oh yeah.

29:47.328 --> 29:50.330
- There's a lot of sauces in there.
- Here, wear this, it's clean.

29:50.364 --> 29:52.966
Really?
Thanks.

29:55.136 --> 29:58.171
Oh my God!
Have you been here all day?

29:58.205 --> 30:01.074
- Yes ma'am.
- Working?

30:01.108 --> 30:04.277
In the kitchen?
The same kitchen I work in?

30:04.311 --> 30:08.882
- Why?
- 'Cause my shirt smells like hoarders,

30:08.916 --> 30:10.216
but this-- this--

30:10.251 --> 30:12.185
smells like a coconut
snickerdoodle.

30:13.354 --> 30:16.990
Spend a year surfing
crystal waves,

30:17.024 --> 30:19.292
hiking up insane mountains
above the Caribbean,

30:19.326 --> 30:22.061
watching dazzling
Costa Rican sunsets--

30:22.096 --> 30:24.964
that will change your smell.

30:24.999 --> 30:26.366
- Completely.
- Wow.

30:26.400 --> 30:30.136
Well, I should get
back to work,

30:30.171 --> 30:33.139
- but thanks for the shirt.
- It's all just fabric to me.

30:33.174 --> 30:35.041
- Bye.
- <i>Bye.</i>

30:39.580 --> 30:41.448
Wear dark green tights
with the Daisy,

30:41.482 --> 30:42.716
light green with the tulip.

30:43.851 --> 30:45.786
<i>No trading!</i>

30:45.820 --> 30:47.754
They try that every year
and it never works.

30:47.789 --> 30:49.523
- Kids.
- You said it.

30:49.557 --> 30:51.758
That's a weeping willow,
not a peeping willow, Darla.

30:51.793 --> 30:53.627
Back down where it was.

30:53.661 --> 30:56.897
Make sure all your friends and
family buy their tickets soon.

30:56.931 --> 30:59.733
The spring flower festival
is very popular

30:59.767 --> 31:03.670
and this year we have that flower
that only blooms once a year

31:03.705 --> 31:07.541
and smells terrible,
tickets are going fast.

31:07.575 --> 31:09.743
If you need alterations,

31:09.777 --> 31:11.645
take your costumes
to Sparkles.

31:11.679 --> 31:14.548
<i>Truly is doing</i>
<i>fittings every afternoon</i>

31:14.582 --> 31:16.383
from 4:00 to 6:00.

31:16.417 --> 31:18.585
Now we'll need extra
rehearsal time this week,

31:18.619 --> 31:21.354
so all adagio classes
will be running late.

31:21.389 --> 31:24.658
Extra-long classes for the same
price as regular classes?

31:24.692 --> 31:27.527
Wow, what a bargain!
I'll say one thing about Balanchine,

31:27.562 --> 31:30.497
he never gave you a break.
Charged eight bucks for a sandwich too.

31:30.531 --> 31:34.401
If you have your costumes and
your instructions, you can go.

31:34.435 --> 31:36.470
Excuse me a sec.
That's my cue.

31:36.504 --> 31:39.773
Okay hello, people, hello hello hello.
A moment please!

31:39.807 --> 31:43.710
Plenty of time later to discuss how adorable
little Timmy's gonna be as a petunia.

31:43.745 --> 31:46.780
And he is. But right now I have something
else that needs to be discussed.

31:46.814 --> 31:48.648
- What are you doing?
- Bad cop.

31:48.683 --> 31:50.484
- What?
- Chiklis.

31:50.518 --> 31:52.619
Hear ye,
hear ye, hear ye...

31:52.653 --> 31:55.388
- Fanny: Michelle.
- How's everybody doing tonight?

31:55.423 --> 31:58.525
Aren't those flower costumes great?
A hand for Fanny.

31:58.559 --> 32:01.461
Does this woman do
a hell of a job or what?

32:01.496 --> 32:05.665
She is da bomb at making sure
your kids don't bomb, am I right?

32:05.700 --> 32:09.469
- Please stop.
- Okay, so as everyone knows,

32:09.504 --> 32:11.571
the first of the month
is next week.

32:11.606 --> 32:14.307
And you all know what happens
on the first of the month?

32:14.342 --> 32:16.476
Well, in most parts of the
world, payment is due.

32:16.511 --> 32:18.712
<i>That's right.</i>
<i>Now I know in the past</i>

32:18.746 --> 32:22.449
Paradise Dance Academy's policy
on paying has been a little lax,

32:22.483 --> 32:24.484
but times,
they are a changin'.

32:24.519 --> 32:28.421
So starting now, everyone
needs to pay for lessons.

32:28.456 --> 32:31.391
Costumes like these
don't grow on trees.

32:31.425 --> 32:34.494
Even the tree costumes do not grow on trees.
We are running a business.

32:34.529 --> 32:37.597
You bring your kids here to learn.
You want them to dance?

32:37.632 --> 32:39.499
You want fame?
Well, fame costs.

32:39.534 --> 32:41.635
<i>And right here's where</i>
<i>you start paying.</i>

32:41.669 --> 32:44.671
In money! I know you thought
I was going to say "sweat,"

32:44.705 --> 32:47.607
but we don't need sweat, we need money!
You hear me?

32:47.642 --> 32:49.676
<i>The gravy train is over.</i>

32:49.710 --> 32:52.479
The bus of freeloading has
reached its destination.

32:52.513 --> 32:54.548
It's time to get off
and open a purse!

32:54.582 --> 32:57.450
Nothing, and I mean
nothing in life is free!

32:57.485 --> 32:59.619
<i>Yes, of course</i>
<i>it's all still free.</i>

32:59.654 --> 33:02.689
What I meant was is, uh,
I'm heavily medicated

33:02.723 --> 33:06.593
and... yes, Fanny was just
as surprised as anybody.

33:06.627 --> 33:10.630
Anyway, so I'm really sorry
that I made little Lucy cry

33:10.665 --> 33:14.734
and I hope you'll consider bringing her
back so she can rehearse for next weekend.

33:14.769 --> 33:17.637
Yes, my doctors
are discussing

33:17.672 --> 33:20.340
a dosage increase
as we speak.

33:20.374 --> 33:22.576
- <i>( Phone ringing )</i>
<i>- Can you hold on a sec?</i>

33:23.610 --> 33:25.345
Paradise Dance Academy.

33:25.879 --> 33:29.316
Thank you so much
for getting back to me, Katie.

33:29.350 --> 33:31.751
Ms. Williams, of course.

33:32.286 --> 33:34.454
I just wanted to apologize
for going into your purse

33:34.488 --> 33:37.457
and grabbing your wallet like that.
It was more for dramatic effect

33:37.491 --> 33:39.359
than anything else.
You understand.

33:39.393 --> 33:42.495
Had I any idea that you had
that arrangement with Fanny...

33:42.530 --> 33:45.398
Four mortgages?
Wow, that's a lot of mortgage.

33:45.433 --> 33:48.668
Okay, can we count
on seeing Pam Saturday?

33:50.471 --> 33:52.572
20 feet away from you
and your family.

33:52.607 --> 33:54.774
I do understand.

33:54.809 --> 33:56.676
Thank you.

33:56.711 --> 33:59.412
( Phones ringing )

34:03.317 --> 34:05.518
Hello?
Hi, Mrs. Woo.

34:06.587 --> 34:08.455
Yes, I know it seems like

34:08.489 --> 34:10.724
you're the only family
paying full price for lessons,

34:10.757 --> 34:13.525
but that's just because Fanny
loves your girls the best.

34:13.561 --> 34:16.396
Yup yup, okay,
that'll work.

34:16.429 --> 34:18.364
See you Saturday.

34:18.399 --> 34:21.301
Well, the good news is

34:21.335 --> 34:23.770
I managed to get back the bees,
a tulip and one weeping willow.

34:23.804 --> 34:26.672
The bad news-- the Woo twins
get half off for two months

34:26.706 --> 34:28.608
and we have to buy
their gas for a year.

34:28.643 --> 34:30.610
How proud Chiklis
must be right now.

34:30.645 --> 34:33.679
- I'm so sorry.
- Six months of rehearsing for this show

34:33.714 --> 34:35.715
and I have half a flower
garden to deal with.

34:35.750 --> 34:39.284
I'm sorry, I'm trying, Fanny.
But the snapdragons won't even call me back

34:39.319 --> 34:40.719
and the pussy willow's mom
is a snot!

34:40.755 --> 34:44.491
You better figure something out, because if
we don't have enough people for that show,

34:44.525 --> 34:46.693
- you'll be wearing this.
- I'm trying.

34:46.726 --> 34:49.362
- What's plan "B"?
- I'll keep making calls

34:49.397 --> 34:51.398
- until I have everyone back.
- And then what?

34:51.431 --> 34:53.600
- And then I'll have everyone back.
- Then we're back to square one.

34:53.634 --> 34:56.369
Actually, square -1
since the Woo twins

34:56.404 --> 34:58.571
- are now half off.
- I don't know what you want me to do.

34:58.606 --> 35:01.274
- I want you to say you'll teach.
- No.

35:01.309 --> 35:03.510
I can add more classes,
we can grow the business.

35:03.544 --> 35:05.478
- I don't teach.
- You've never tried.

35:05.513 --> 35:08.748
- I don't teach.
- Then what do you do since leaving Vegas,

35:08.783 --> 35:12.719
except sleep with possums and fill the
recycle bin with trashy magazines?

35:12.753 --> 35:15.755
- I have calls to make.
- I've seen you with those kids, you're good.

35:15.790 --> 35:17.424
There are a lot
of good teachers.

35:17.458 --> 35:19.359
That dance you had them
do for me?

35:19.393 --> 35:22.629
You put that together in hours.
And that night you showed up with Hubbell--

35:22.663 --> 35:25.432
- that dance audition-- you're a natural.
- So what?

35:25.466 --> 35:27.334
They like you.
They connect with you.

35:27.368 --> 35:29.602
I don't want them to get too connected.
I may not stay here forever.

35:29.637 --> 35:32.305
- Then teach temporarily.
- I don't do anything half-assed.

35:32.340 --> 35:34.374
- Currently you don't do anything at all.
- Enough, Fanny.

35:34.408 --> 35:36.376
- Try, just try!
- No!

35:36.410 --> 35:39.579
Now I'm sorry that
I screwed up your show

35:39.613 --> 35:42.515
but I don't teach! You teach!
That's you! Not me!

35:57.070 --> 35:59.572
- Tell Boo to hurry up. We're already late.
- You're not coming in?

35:59.606 --> 36:01.640
I don't feel the need to smell
like burnt garbage at the moment.

36:01.675 --> 36:03.676
- You're not even going to turn off the car?
- No. Why?

36:03.710 --> 36:05.578
It's weird.
It's like we're robbing the place.

36:05.612 --> 36:07.446
- Boo could've been in the car by now.
- Fine.

36:07.480 --> 36:10.516
- Don't abandon us here.
- I'll weigh my decision carefully.

36:10.550 --> 36:12.518
Oh, there she is.

36:12.552 --> 36:13.786
Godot: <i>Bettina!</i>

36:13.820 --> 36:15.754
- Who's Bettina?
- That's Boo.

36:15.789 --> 36:18.424
<i>You're kidding.</i>
<i>I thought her name was Boo.</i>

36:18.458 --> 36:20.459
- <i>Boo is short for Bettina.
</i> <i>- Oh.</i>

36:20.493 --> 36:22.628
How is Boo short
for Bettina?

36:23.930 --> 36:25.731
When did those two
become friends?

36:26.265 --> 36:29.968
Look how close to him
she is-- inches.

36:30.002 --> 36:31.937
- So lucky.
- Sasha: <i>Yes.</i>

36:31.971 --> 36:34.272
Standing inches from a
bartender is incredibly lucky.

36:34.307 --> 36:38.076
There's no other situation in the entire
world where you could possibly do that.

36:38.111 --> 36:41.379
Except for every happy hour in the world.
She just peaked.

36:41.414 --> 36:44.316
- This is like a drive-in movie.
- A really bad one.

36:44.350 --> 36:46.351
Yeah, a really good
bad drive-in movie.

36:46.385 --> 36:48.353
Give it a listen,
let me know what you think.

36:48.387 --> 36:51.056
But I'm betting a blown mind
is coming your way.

36:51.090 --> 36:54.025
- Sounds dangerous.
- People say he's the father of surf music.

36:54.060 --> 36:56.328
Dude practically invented
the reverb sound

36:56.362 --> 36:59.064
- on the strings of his Stratocaster.
- Awesome.

36:59.098 --> 37:02.267
- I'll give it listen the minute I get home.
- I want a full report tomorrow.

37:02.301 --> 37:04.269
Aye aye, Captain.

37:07.807 --> 37:10.843
Hey!
Ready?

37:12.679 --> 37:14.647
So what was
that all about?

37:14.681 --> 37:16.515
- What?
- You and Godot?

37:16.549 --> 37:18.817
- Looked cozy.
- Like all that was missing was a slow jam.

37:18.852 --> 37:21.620
Please.
He's a friend.

37:21.655 --> 37:24.390
- A friendly friend?
- We were just talking.

37:24.424 --> 37:27.593
Yeah? What happened after you used
up the 10 words in his vocabulary?

37:27.627 --> 37:30.663
We were talking about music.
He gave me this CD

37:30.697 --> 37:32.798
- to listen to. See?
- Cool.

37:32.832 --> 37:35.401
A CD?
That's current.

37:36.435 --> 37:38.437
Hey...
How come you don't smell?

37:39.471 --> 37:40.839
Ever since
he gave me his shirt,

37:40.874 --> 37:43.409
it's like I totally
don't smell any more.

37:43.443 --> 37:45.744
It's like I have
this smell force field.

37:45.779 --> 37:48.480
- He gave you his shirt?
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

37:51.350 --> 37:53.485
- What?
- Nothing.

37:54.520 --> 37:56.722
Nice tartar sauce
on your pants.

37:58.758 --> 38:01.760
- <i>( Soft rock music playing )</i>
<i>- </i> <i>( Vocalizing )</i>

38:14.340 --> 38:15.741
Welcome welcome, everyone.

38:20.714 --> 38:23.382
And now to kick off
the flower show,

38:23.416 --> 38:25.684
the advanced class
of the Paradise Dance Academy

38:25.719 --> 38:27.720
will perform their
"Tribute to Spring."

38:28.254 --> 38:30.756
<i>an original ballet</i>
<i>that tells the story</i>

38:30.790 --> 38:34.626
of nature's struggle against
the forces of industrialism.

38:34.661 --> 38:37.763
It's entitled
"Paper or Plastic."

38:38.297 --> 38:40.131
I hope you enjoy it.

38:46.038 --> 38:48.373
- So you got them all back.
- All but two.

38:48.407 --> 38:52.143
I had to pay those two concession
chicks five bucks to stand there.

38:52.178 --> 38:55.146
- "Paper or Plastic"?
- Mm-hmm.

38:56.249 --> 38:59.117
<i>( Music playing )</i>

39:06.493 --> 39:10.396
Fanny: <i>See, it starts with nature,</i>
<i>free and happy.</i>

39:17.604 --> 39:20.372
<i>Then the forces</i>
<i>of evil enter.</i>

39:20.407 --> 39:22.508
Michelle: <i>The supermarket cashier?
</i> <i>That's right.</i>

39:22.542 --> 39:25.544
<i>A force ignorant</i>
<i>of the evil she's doing,</i>

39:25.578 --> 39:27.546
<i>blinded by money</i>
<i>and corruption.</i>

39:27.580 --> 39:29.648
A supermarket cashier
blinded by money?

39:29.682 --> 39:31.583
What supermarket
do you shop in?

39:33.553 --> 39:36.522
<i>Then comes the moment</i> <i>the
fatal question</i> <i>is asked...</i>

39:36.556 --> 39:39.391
<i>Paper</i>

39:39.426 --> 39:41.460
<i>or plastic?</i>

39:41.494 --> 39:43.595
( Laughing )
This is nuts.

39:46.800 --> 39:49.468
<i>A vicious battle ensues.</i>

39:51.738 --> 39:53.639
<i>The hero enters.</i>

39:53.673 --> 39:55.607
- The canvas tote!
- The canvas tote!

39:55.642 --> 39:57.676
I always forget
that canvas tote.

40:02.615 --> 40:04.550
<i>Its motives are pure,</i>

40:04.584 --> 40:06.885
<i>but it's just one force</i>
<i>against an army</i>

40:06.920 --> 40:09.688
<i>of nonrenewable</i>
<i>resources.</i>

40:24.704 --> 40:26.839
The battle ends.
The die is cast.

40:26.873 --> 40:30.476
<i>The cashier looks around</i>
<i>at the utter destruction</i>

40:30.510 --> 40:31.844
<i>she's wrought...</i>

40:35.582 --> 40:36.949
And goes on break.

40:40.752 --> 40:42.988
I'm sorry,
so nature dies?

40:43.222 --> 40:43.722
Yep.

40:48.728 --> 40:51.763
So it's a happy ending?
You're diabolical.

40:51.798 --> 40:54.700
- It is one of my best.
- That was awesome!

40:54.734 --> 40:57.603
It was.
And it was fun--

40:57.637 --> 41:00.639
<i>putting it together,</i>
<i>working with the kids.</i>

41:02.809 --> 41:06.478
You know, just because you
teach, doesn't mean it's over.

41:06.513 --> 41:08.514
Fanny, that was amazing.
Your best yet.

41:08.548 --> 41:11.583
- Thank you, Sal.   - I know.
When the ecosystem broke down.

41:11.618 --> 41:12.851
- so did I.
- I'm glad.

41:12.886 --> 41:15.654
Screw Martha Graham!
Screw her.

41:16.188 --> 41:17.623
Honey, go get a pretzel.

41:17.657 --> 41:19.791
Oh, and I want to thank you
ladies for the shout out.

41:19.826 --> 41:21.627
<i>Really big of you.</i>

41:21.661 --> 41:23.862
So that makes us square until next
paying season, right, Sal?

41:23.897 --> 41:25.731
Absolutely.

41:25.765 --> 41:28.433
- You're an ice skater, right?
- Don't look at my tush.

41:28.468 --> 41:30.669
You've got a little bit
of an Oksana Baiul going on.

41:30.703 --> 41:32.638
It's creepy, Sal.
It's creepy.

41:32.672 --> 41:34.773
Does he realize that he
still hasn't gotten paid?

41:34.807 --> 41:36.575
Nope.
And he never will.
