WEBVTT

00:02.320 --> 00:03.719
'Previously on St Elsewhere:'

00:03.719 --> 00:06.240
Six of them in here. That's enough
to tide you over.

00:06.240 --> 00:08.560
Someone at St Eligius is about
to brought upon charges

00:08.560 --> 00:11.640
for the improper dispensing
of controlled drugs.

00:11.640 --> 00:14.360
The woman was so desperate. I just
wanted to help her.

00:14.360 --> 00:17.360
You shouldn't have released those
drugs without a prescription.

00:17.360 --> 00:19.480
He's proposing marriage to you.

00:19.480 --> 00:21.320
I accept!  So do I.

00:21.320 --> 00:22.320
I accept!  So do I.

00:22.320 --> 00:24.560
We don't know anything except she's
in a lot of pain.

00:24.560 --> 00:25.880
'Tonight on St Elsewhere:'

00:25.880 --> 00:28.360
In theory, a deaf guy is as capable
as anyone.

00:28.360 --> 00:29.880
Are you saying he can't do the job?

00:29.880 --> 00:31.640
You're trying to make me quit!

00:31.640 --> 00:34.040
I'm just trying to get the job done.

00:34.040 --> 00:35.480
This is an official hearing.

00:35.480 --> 00:37.680
If it comes out that you threw Peter
the keys...

00:37.680 --> 00:38.640
If it comes out that you threw Peter
the keys...

00:38.640 --> 00:41.400
You could, in some way, soften your
testimony.

00:41.400 --> 00:44.720
You're actually suggesting that I
perjure myself on the witness stand?

00:44.720 --> 00:47.440
You know where would be a fabulous
place for a wedding?

00:47.440 --> 00:48.520
Where? Where?

00:48.520 --> 00:49.560
Dr Craig's house.

00:49.560 --> 00:51.520
I need to obtain some cannabis.

00:51.520 --> 00:52.840
I need to obtain some cannabis.

00:52.840 --> 00:56.160
So this is what the fuss is all
about.

00:56.160 --> 01:00.160
Anybody got a match?

02:38.040 --> 02:40.120
What'd they get this time, Rudy?

02:40.120 --> 02:44.120
Half a bottle of Muscatel and a
shopping cart with all my stuff.

02:45.440 --> 02:47.600
Well, the Muscatel you could do
without.

02:47.600 --> 02:51.600
Hey... I never touch that stuff.
I was just holding it for my buddy.

02:54.360 --> 02:55.920
Take it easy, lady. &gt;

02:55.920 --> 02:59.720
I... I can't help you if you don't
tell me what's wrong.

02:59.720 --> 03:00.960
SHE SCREAMS IN PAIN

03:00.960 --> 03:02.640
Where does it hurt?

03:02.640 --> 03:06.640
You're really going to have to start
taking better care of yourself, OK?

03:07.320 --> 03:11.320
All right. I'll try and find you a
bed.

03:12.440 --> 03:15.320
&lt; Annie, could you help me with
this woman?

03:15.320 --> 03:16.880
What's the problem?

03:16.880 --> 03:18.600
That's the mystery question.

03:18.600 --> 03:21.320
She's obviously in a lot of pain
but she won't tell me where.

03:21.320 --> 03:25.320
Point to where it hurts.

03:25.720 --> 03:27.880
I think maybe she's deaf.

03:27.880 --> 03:29.520
Oh, great. What do we do now?

03:29.520 --> 03:31.120
She's really suffering.

03:31.120 --> 03:33.960
Isn't there a guy in radiology
who knows how to sign?

03:33.960 --> 03:35.840
I'll see if I can get a hold of him.

03:35.840 --> 03:37.480
DEAF WOMAN GROANS

03:37.480 --> 03:40.240
It's going to be all right now.
It's going to be OK.

03:40.240 --> 03:44.240
HE WHISTLES

03:45.080 --> 03:46.440
Finally.

03:46.440 --> 03:48.720
Hm. Yeah. The graffiti was the last
straw.

03:48.720 --> 03:52.720
I got the board to pony up
for the whole room.

03:53.760 --> 03:56.480
Donald, I won't be able attend Peter
White's hearing tomorrow.

03:56.480 --> 03:58.760
That's all right. Don't worry.
We're in good shape.

03:58.760 --> 04:00.320
I'm having a meeting this morning

04:00.320 --> 04:03.480
with Burt Michelson and Peter
and figure out the legal situation.

04:03.480 --> 04:05.120
I want them to be well-prepared.

04:05.120 --> 04:06.520
Good.

04:06.520 --> 04:09.240
I'm starting another dose
of chemotherapy this afternoon.

04:09.240 --> 04:10.440
How's that going?

04:10.440 --> 04:11.520
Terrible.

04:11.520 --> 04:14.840
Haven't had a cup of coffee or any
meat or liquor in three weeks.

04:14.840 --> 04:17.360
On top of which, the chemo's
like a rollercoaster,

04:17.360 --> 04:19.800
and unfortunately, I'm coming to one
of the dips.

04:19.800 --> 04:21.760
Still, it's better than doing nothing
at all.

04:21.760 --> 04:25.760
Last time I suffered in silence.
This time I intend to bitch.

04:29.120 --> 04:30.680
Helen.

04:30.680 --> 04:32.960
Glad you're here.
I need some advice.

04:32.960 --> 04:36.360
About the wedding. So far, all we
know is that my oldest friend Docker

04:36.360 --> 04:38.760
is flying in from Santa Cruz
to be best man.

04:38.760 --> 04:41.200
That's if I front him the plane
fare. The big question is,

04:41.200 --> 04:42.600
where are we going to hold it?

04:42.600 --> 04:46.000
Philadelphia. That's where Roberta's
parent's are from, isn't it?

04:46.000 --> 04:47.800
That's what I'm trying to tell you,
Helen.

04:47.800 --> 04:49.400
We don't want it in Philadelphia.

04:49.400 --> 04:51.640
We want to do this our way,
here in Boston.

04:51.640 --> 04:54.160
We're going to make all the plans
exactly the way we want.

04:54.160 --> 04:57.280
I'll bet there are lots of wonderful
places in Boston to get married.

04:57.280 --> 04:59.840
You've been through it so many
times,

04:59.840 --> 05:01.880
I figured you know the places
to stay away from.

05:01.880 --> 05:04.840
I mean, all your weddings couldn't
have been pearls, right?

05:04.840 --> 05:06.680
I've only been married four times.

05:06.680 --> 05:09.640
You make it sound like I'm neck
and neck with Elizabeth Taylor.

05:09.640 --> 05:12.640
Helen, wait a minute. I'm sorry.
That's not what I mean.

05:12.640 --> 05:15.480
I'm sorry. This whole thing's got me
so crazy.

05:15.480 --> 05:17.680
You see, Roberta's parents are
arriving tomorrow,

05:17.680 --> 05:19.520
and unless I have a battle plan,

05:19.520 --> 05:22.280
this is going to be the Randall
and Judith Sloane wedding.

05:22.280 --> 05:25.200
Oh, come on, Victor. Everyone has
problems with their in-laws.

05:25.200 --> 05:26.360
Huh.

05:26.360 --> 05:28.680
Helen, you don't really understand
these people.

05:28.680 --> 05:30.880
This is not Randy and Judy
from Philly.

05:30.880 --> 05:34.880
This is Mr and Mrs Randall
Pier-Sloane from Bryn Mawr,
thank you very much.

05:35.520 --> 05:37.120
He's some big real estate tycoon,

05:37.120 --> 05:39.560
she's heavily into historical
preservation.

05:39.560 --> 05:41.040
They get their own way.

05:41.040 --> 05:43.080
Victor, you haven't even met them.

05:43.080 --> 05:46.440
It doesn't matter.
From Roberta's description,

05:46.440 --> 05:48.160
I know what they're like. Trust me.

05:48.160 --> 05:51.240
I've seen snapshots of their place.
It's unbelievable.

05:51.240 --> 05:55.240
It's this humongous thing built
in 1773 by Roberta's ancestors.

05:55.800 --> 05:57.720
Look up the word 'snooty'
in the dictionary,

05:57.720 --> 05:59.800
you'll find their picture.
You got to help me.

05:59.800 --> 06:01.720
So how big is this wedding going
to be?

06:01.720 --> 06:05.520
175... 100?

06:05.520 --> 06:06.880
75?

06:06.880 --> 06:10.360
You know where I've thought would be
a fabulous place for a wedding?

06:10.360 --> 06:11.080
Where? Where?

06:11.080 --> 06:13.760
Where? Where?

06:13.760 --> 06:15.000
You're not helping.

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
No, I'm serious, really.
You should ask him.

06:20.800 --> 06:24.800
&lt; Candoski, with a C. Thank you.

06:26.040 --> 06:29.040
What's wrong, Shirley?

06:29.040 --> 06:33.040
Come in here.

06:42.240 --> 06:44.240
Did you get a subpoena?

06:44.240 --> 06:46.440
It's ridiculous. I wasn't even on
call that night.

06:46.440 --> 06:48.000
Good luck.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.760
Oh, it'll work out. You'll see.
As soon as they realise

06:50.760 --> 06:53.000
that Peter made a mistake
in judgement...

06:53.000 --> 06:54.920
That's great for Peter.
What about me?

06:54.920 --> 06:57.160
You got your wrist slapped here
at the hospital.

06:57.160 --> 06:59.200
Jack, this is an official hearing.

06:59.200 --> 07:01.280
The nursing board gets a copy
of the transcript.

07:01.280 --> 07:03.520
If it comes out that you threw Peter
the keys...

07:03.520 --> 07:05.920
I'm finished.

07:05.920 --> 07:07.200
I trusted him.

07:07.200 --> 07:10.120
I was dealing with a burn patient
and I'm the one who got burned.

07:10.120 --> 07:13.520
No... You both had the best
of intentions.

07:13.520 --> 07:15.600
Take it easy. You're jumping
to conclusions.

07:15.600 --> 07:18.760
That fact is, the drugs in that
cabinet were my responsibility.

07:18.760 --> 07:22.640
Sorry, but we better clean up Mr
Billings for his 2:30 thorascopy.

07:22.640 --> 07:26.640
Sure. That's what I love about
working on the wards.

07:27.440 --> 07:31.440
WOMAN SOBS

07:36.160 --> 07:38.160
They said you needed someone
who could sign.

07:38.160 --> 07:39.840
Oh, am I glad to see you.
I'm Dr Fiscus.

07:39.840 --> 07:41.440
Lee. Do you know her name?

07:41.440 --> 07:42.920
Erm, no.

07:42.920 --> 07:46.920
We don't know anything except she's
in a lot of pain.

07:48.280 --> 07:49.360
Her name's Carla.

07:49.360 --> 07:52.040
Hello, Carla.

07:52.040 --> 07:53.080
It's her stomach.

07:53.080 --> 07:56.840
Ask her how long she's been in pain.

07:56.840 --> 07:59.360
Since yesterday morning. It's been
getting worse.

07:59.360 --> 08:01.800
It could be appendix.
I have to run some tests...

08:01.800 --> 08:03.760
I'm sorry, you have to face me when
you speak.

08:03.760 --> 08:05.520
I read lips not back of heads.

08:05.520 --> 08:07.080
I'm sorry, Lee.

08:07.080 --> 08:10.240
Tell Carla that I've got to examine
her and take some blood.

08:10.240 --> 08:13.680
We'll need abdominal obstruction
series, stat.

08:13.680 --> 08:15.320
I'll take her when you're ready.

08:15.320 --> 08:19.320
Thank you, Lee. Wait right here.

08:19.680 --> 08:21.640
Daniel?  Martin.

08:21.640 --> 08:23.880
Sorry, I got hung up with a patient
downstairs.

08:23.880 --> 08:27.520
You realise that I've just gotten
over the side effects from last time.

08:27.520 --> 08:29.560
We had you on Atarax, right?

08:29.560 --> 08:31.800
It usually works pretty well,
at least with nausea.

08:31.800 --> 08:34.520
It was totally worthless.

08:34.520 --> 08:36.480
All right. Let's try Revlimid.

08:36.480 --> 08:39.080
I already did. I break out in hives.

08:39.080 --> 08:42.480
Morton, this is ridiculous. I can't
take any time off this round.

08:42.480 --> 08:44.200
I need to stay active.

08:44.200 --> 08:45.480
Want to try some Compazine,

08:45.480 --> 08:48.080
jump on a Percodan or Demerol
for the pain?

08:48.080 --> 08:49.840
Why don't you try smoking marijuana?

08:49.840 --> 08:51.800
They tell me it works like a charm.

08:51.800 --> 08:54.720
Morton, I'm your patient, remember?

08:54.720 --> 08:57.360
I wish I could help you out by
writing a prescription,

08:57.360 --> 09:00.160
but unfortunately, THC capsules are
illegal in Massachusetts.

09:00.160 --> 09:04.160
Are you suggesting that I circumvent
the law to obtain the cannabis?

09:08.200 --> 09:12.200
Using it may...take the edge off.

09:13.280 --> 09:16.440
Drugs can be a problem in any
hospital.

09:16.440 --> 09:19.280
But when they send in these spies
and phony patients,

09:19.280 --> 09:21.720
it becomes impossible to practice
medicine decently.

09:21.720 --> 09:24.800
You'll be up against an experienced
prosecutor, Ralph Tanner.

09:24.800 --> 09:28.360
He's council to the board, so keep
your answers short and to the point.

09:28.360 --> 09:30.520
Everything's done in an even-handed
way.

09:30.520 --> 09:32.560
Any idea who's hearing the case?

09:32.560 --> 09:34.560
Dr Lisa Purcell. I trust her.

09:34.560 --> 09:37.120
She knows the rules of evidence
inside and out.

09:37.120 --> 09:38.880
She determines the facts

09:38.880 --> 09:41.360
then she reports her findings
to the full board.

09:41.360 --> 09:44.000
You get a verdict the next day.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.120
You did say there would be nothing
in the press, right?

09:47.120 --> 09:50.360
Well, not at this stage.

09:50.360 --> 09:53.440
You'll also have a chance to call
witnesses on your own behalf,

09:53.440 --> 09:55.040
Dr Westphall for one.

09:55.040 --> 09:58.840
I'll try and explain the extenuating
circumstances in the case.

09:58.840 --> 10:01.320
Now, there are a number of possible
punishments,

10:01.320 --> 10:05.200
from an informal admonishment on up
to a formal censure.

10:05.200 --> 10:09.200
They could even take away your
licence to practice medicine.

10:09.440 --> 10:12.960
But don't worry. That's not even a
remote possibility in this case.

10:12.960 --> 10:16.960
In the meantime, why don't we focus
on your state of mind

10:18.080 --> 10:22.080
when the undercover agent asked you
for the drugs.

10:24.800 --> 10:27.280
What we're seeing here?

10:27.280 --> 10:31.280
A branch below the origin
of the anterior tibial artery.

10:31.680 --> 10:35.200
Bring out the taele, please. What are
we going to do about it?

10:35.200 --> 10:38.520
Well, we could go femoral posterior
tibial.

10:38.520 --> 10:42.520
Uh-uh. Too much plaque in that
direction. Go around it.

10:42.880 --> 10:46.880
You know, that reminds me. I guess
you heard I'm getting married.

10:48.120 --> 10:51.960
Well, most people like to get both
feet on the ground first.

10:51.960 --> 10:55.440
Well, I'm feeling pretty confident
about work these days.

10:55.440 --> 10:57.840
Confident enough to let this man
bleed to death?

10:57.840 --> 10:58.880
Sorry?

10:58.880 --> 11:02.880
Your stich, Ehrlich. Hatchet, stat.

11:03.480 --> 11:06.560
I suppose you're going to have one
of those spaced-out ceremonies

11:06.560 --> 11:08.480
on a beach in California.

11:08.480 --> 11:12.480
Actually, we're planning on getting
married here in Boston. Some place.

11:13.160 --> 11:16.040
Well, that's the most sensible
thought you've had in a long time.

11:16.040 --> 11:20.040
The ceremony we're planning is,
you know, pretty traditional.

11:20.520 --> 11:24.040
You know, "Do you take this woman",
bridesmaids, best man.

11:24.040 --> 11:27.680
I think you'd like it. Cut please.

11:27.680 --> 11:30.120
I've got family back on the coast,
a few good friends,

11:30.120 --> 11:34.120
but Boston is where we live, so it's
where we're going to get married.

11:37.600 --> 11:40.080
Dr Craig, I don't know how to ask
this...

11:40.080 --> 11:41.920
You don't have to, Ehrlich.

11:41.920 --> 11:45.840
It would be my pleasure.

11:45.840 --> 11:47.520
All right.

11:47.520 --> 11:49.440
Dr Craig, I don't know what to say.

11:49.440 --> 11:52.640
It reminds of the time Bob Oberman
asked me the same thing.

11:52.640 --> 11:55.320
He was my old roommate at Penn.

11:55.320 --> 11:56.640
Poor guy, just got a divorce.

11:56.640 --> 12:00.640
That was 30 years ago. I haven't been
anyone's best man since.

12:05.360 --> 12:07.880
Er... Dr Craig?

12:07.880 --> 12:11.240
Ehrlich, let's make sure everyone
wears real bowties,

12:11.240 --> 12:13.160
not those tacky clip-on kind.

12:13.160 --> 12:17.160
Er... Real bowties, huh?

12:24.160 --> 12:28.160
If you'd waited for maintenance on
this you'd be in the dark for weeks.

12:28.200 --> 12:32.200
Believe me, I know.

12:32.320 --> 12:35.400
Robert, there's certainly
no signs of metastasis here.

12:35.400 --> 12:38.360
Was planning to swing
a deltoid flap up from the neck.

12:38.360 --> 12:40.800
Still like to see a CAT scan
before you start?

12:40.800 --> 12:43.560
Never get her in today.
Radiology's booked solid.

12:43.560 --> 12:46.400
It's OK. I'll do it myself
for 12:30.

12:46.400 --> 12:50.400
Thanks. I'll have her ready.

12:51.840 --> 12:54.840
Al, you have a line of patients
all the way down the hall.

12:54.840 --> 12:56.920
I've never seen it that bad,
what's the problem?

12:56.920 --> 12:58.720
Yesterday I couldn't give
an X-ray away,

12:58.720 --> 13:01.160
today you'd think
there's a two-for-one sale on.

13:01.160 --> 13:03.440
When we get jammed up like this,
we're understaffed.

13:03.440 --> 13:06.760
Oh, no, come on, we hired a new man
for you, what, a few weeks ago?

13:06.760 --> 13:10.400
I know. Believe me,
we needed someone, but...

13:10.400 --> 13:12.880
But what?

13:12.880 --> 13:16.040
In theory, a deaf guy
is as capable as anyone.

13:16.040 --> 13:18.080
But not in practice?

13:18.080 --> 13:19.880
Look. Lee slows everything down.

13:19.880 --> 13:22.560
He's a nice guy, but like you said,
we're backed up pretty bad.

13:22.560 --> 13:24.240
Are you telling me
he can't do the job?

13:24.240 --> 13:27.880
I'm telling you that
he can't do it fast.

13:27.880 --> 13:30.120
Besides, I know a lot of guys
get bumped from jobs

13:30.120 --> 13:32.880
just because they're normal
to make room for guys like him.

13:32.880 --> 13:34.880
Now we didn't bump anybody,
and you know it.

13:34.880 --> 13:37.480
And I can vouch for the training
programme that Lee attended

13:37.480 --> 13:38.960
at Rochester, it's first class.

13:38.960 --> 13:41.360
Why don't you tell that
to the patients?

13:41.360 --> 13:44.480
It's just that he's...

13:44.480 --> 13:48.480
He makes them nervous.

13:52.600 --> 13:54.440
You're going outside like that?

13:54.440 --> 13:56.720
The temperature outside
doesn't matter that much.

13:56.720 --> 14:00.360
Once I get going, legs warm right up.

14:00.360 --> 14:03.760
See you later.

14:03.760 --> 14:04.880
All the best.

14:04.880 --> 14:08.800
Yeah. Thanks.

14:08.800 --> 14:12.800
You know, I feel like I'm in
good hands with Michaelson guy.

14:13.280 --> 14:15.960
With Westphall showing up,
how can I miss, huh?

14:15.960 --> 14:19.960
We're all going to do
what we can, Peter.

14:20.360 --> 14:24.120
I guess you realise how upset
Shirley is about the spot she's in.

14:24.120 --> 14:27.120
And if those whole business about
the keys comes out at the hearing,

14:27.120 --> 14:29.120
she could be brought up
on charges herself.

14:29.120 --> 14:31.920
Yeah, I know, I know.

14:31.920 --> 14:34.480
I keep thinking
that if I was on call that night,

14:34.480 --> 14:38.480
I'd be on trial right now
instead of you. But the fact is...

14:38.600 --> 14:40.080
the woman  was  your patient.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.920
No, no, she was nobody's patient.

14:41.920 --> 14:44.760
That's why we're in
all this trouble.

14:44.760 --> 14:47.880
All right. The point is
that Shirley only threw you the keys

14:47.880 --> 14:51.400
because she trusted you.
And now she's in a jam.

14:51.400 --> 14:53.400
And I guess she feels
you owe her one.

14:53.400 --> 14:54.640
One what?

14:54.640 --> 14:58.080
Well, maybe if you could
in some way soften your testimony

14:58.080 --> 14:59.880
to put Shirley in a better light.

14:59.880 --> 15:01.760
Wait a minute...

15:01.760 --> 15:05.000
Is this the real Jack Morrison
speaking here?

15:05.000 --> 15:06.360
Mr Integrity?

15:06.360 --> 15:08.960
I mean, you're actually suggesting
that I perjure myself

15:08.960 --> 15:12.680
on the witness stand? Jack, it's not
just the two of us testifying.

15:12.680 --> 15:16.680
The undercover agent's testifying
too. I mean, she was there.

15:23.840 --> 15:27.840
Let me think about it. All right?

15:31.920 --> 15:35.920
CHATTERING

15:36.040 --> 15:37.600
You look terrible.

15:37.600 --> 15:40.160
I don't know why they call them
the side effects,

15:40.160 --> 15:43.400
they hit you square in the face.

15:43.400 --> 15:45.320
I took some medication...

15:45.320 --> 15:47.400
about 12 hours ago.

15:47.400 --> 15:50.080
And now my legs are so swollen,
I feel like a stuffed sausage.

15:50.080 --> 15:51.720
Well, what are you going to do?

15:51.720 --> 15:54.160
Stop the chemo? It's the only thing
that's keeping you alive.

15:54.160 --> 15:55.200
Stop the chemo? It's the only thing
that's keeping you alive.

15:55.200 --> 15:57.440
I have to think of some other way
to cope with this.

15:57.440 --> 15:58.720
The medications don't help.

15:58.720 --> 16:01.760
Bed rest, Daniel.
Don't try to be a hero.

16:01.760 --> 16:04.680
If anyone has told me that I would
come to the end of my life

16:04.680 --> 16:08.400
in intermittent agony...

16:08.400 --> 16:11.200
..that I would deny myself
every known earthly pleasure

16:11.200 --> 16:13.880
just to try and keep things
from getting worse...

16:13.880 --> 16:15.000
What would you have done?

16:15.000 --> 16:19.000
I would've told them
they were out of their minds.

16:20.120 --> 16:23.040
May I sit?

16:23.040 --> 16:24.720
My name's Vijay Kochar.

16:24.720 --> 16:26.400
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

16:26.400 --> 16:27.560
Oh. Very few do.

16:27.560 --> 16:28.800
No, no - I don't hear.

16:28.800 --> 16:30.400
Should I talk loud?

16:30.400 --> 16:34.200
Oh, just slowly.
It helps if you use your hands.

16:34.200 --> 16:38.200
Oh. Pass the salt, please.

16:40.120 --> 16:41.640
What's your name?

16:41.640 --> 16:42.760
Lee Touvan.

16:42.760 --> 16:45.680
I started about a month ago
in Radiology.

16:45.680 --> 16:49.680
Do you enjoy it there?

16:49.680 --> 16:52.160
You know, everyone was new
here once.

16:52.160 --> 16:53.680
It's hard at first.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.560
With so many people.

16:55.560 --> 16:59.560
When I first arrived here
from India, I was in the oncol room.

17:00.120 --> 17:01.920
I was so bewildered.

17:01.920 --> 17:03.520
Where do you work?

17:03.520 --> 17:05.560
I'm an anaesthesiologist.

17:05.560 --> 17:08.319
There's a surgical nurse there.
Scottie Galloway?

17:08.319 --> 17:09.560
Ah, yes.

17:09.560 --> 17:12.760
She always waves hi to me
in the hallways. Great eyes.

17:12.760 --> 17:15.560
That's not all!

17:15.560 --> 17:17.720
I'd like to get to know her, but how?

17:17.720 --> 17:21.400
Well, have you tried saying...hi?

17:21.400 --> 17:25.400
It's hard for me to communicate
with anyone in a surgical mask.

17:26.200 --> 17:30.200
I know.

17:30.360 --> 17:34.160
Dr Fiscus.

17:34.160 --> 17:37.760
Dr Fiscus, I wondered
if I might have a word with you.

17:37.760 --> 17:38.880
Sure thing.

17:38.880 --> 17:40.640
I want to try a little experiment...

17:40.640 --> 17:43.160
on myself.

17:43.160 --> 17:46.280
And I was wondering if you might not
be in a position to do me a favour.

17:46.280 --> 17:50.280
OK.

17:50.800 --> 17:53.960
I need to know how to obtain
some cannabis.

17:53.960 --> 17:55.240
What?!

17:55.240 --> 17:58.040
Marijuana. Pot. Smoke. Reefer.

17:58.040 --> 18:00.960
Something to counteract
the side effects of chemotherapy.

18:00.960 --> 18:02.160
Of course.

18:02.160 --> 18:04.040
I wouldn't want you
to do anything illegal.

18:04.040 --> 18:06.600
It's just that I'm in
a bit of a rush.

18:06.600 --> 18:09.720
I thought that perhaps
you might be in a position

18:09.720 --> 18:11.640
to point me in the right direction.

18:11.640 --> 18:15.640
If that's not possible,
I'll certainly understand.

18:25.640 --> 18:26.880
Hello.

18:26.880 --> 18:29.440
Hello.
Hi.

18:29.440 --> 18:30.520
Want a doughnut?

18:30.520 --> 18:34.520
No. Thanks.

18:35.960 --> 18:38.400
Peter will land on his feet.

18:38.400 --> 18:39.760
He always does.

18:39.760 --> 18:41.400
I think we can trust the system.

18:41.400 --> 18:44.280
In my dealings with the board,
they've always been extremely fair.

18:44.280 --> 18:47.640
They told us the undercover
agent's on the stand.

18:47.640 --> 18:51.200
This was your kid you brought
to the ER.

18:51.200 --> 18:52.800
Alison, she's two-and-a-half.

18:52.800 --> 18:55.320
You felt you needed her
as part of the scam?

18:55.320 --> 18:57.480
These things are very carefully
worked out.

18:57.480 --> 19:00.760
In other words, you didn't think
you could get the pills without her.

19:00.760 --> 19:02.320
That was my supervisor's decision.

19:02.320 --> 19:04.880
You knew there was nothing wrong
with the child medically,

19:04.880 --> 19:07.720
and still you dragged her
out in the middle of the night

19:07.720 --> 19:09.880
in order to bamboozle
some unsuspecting doctor...

19:09.880 --> 19:12.080
in order to bamboozle
some unsuspecting doctor...

19:12.080 --> 19:16.080
How often do you subject your child
to this kind of thing?

19:16.240 --> 19:16.760
Objection.

19:16.760 --> 19:17.800
Objection.

19:17.800 --> 19:19.920
Totally irrelevant, Mr Michaelson.

19:19.920 --> 19:22.880
We're not interested in how
frequently the state police

19:22.880 --> 19:26.880
run their undercover operations.

19:27.200 --> 19:28.720
Could you tell us, Mrs Russ,

19:28.720 --> 19:31.440
exactly how Dr White obtained
the Seconal for you?

19:31.440 --> 19:33.480
I have no idea, really,
I was busy with Alison.

19:33.480 --> 19:35.560
Oh. Well, um...

19:35.560 --> 19:38.840
you came in and you complained
of a sleeping problem,

19:38.840 --> 19:41.960
and then you showed him
a prescription bottle

19:41.960 --> 19:43.560
with an out-of-town doctor's name
on it, right?

19:43.560 --> 19:44.680
with an out-of-town doctor's name
on it, right?

19:44.680 --> 19:47.280
If Dr White had charged
you another ¤55

19:47.280 --> 19:49.640
and admitted you as an outpatient,
we wouldn't be here.

19:49.640 --> 19:52.800
Objection, that's not a question,
that's a speech.

19:52.800 --> 19:54.520
Sustained.

19:54.520 --> 19:56.880
No further speeches.

19:56.880 --> 20:00.880
How long have you held your
present position, Dr Westphall?

20:01.040 --> 20:03.360
Since 1975.

20:03.360 --> 20:05.040
And in all that time, sir,

20:05.040 --> 20:09.040
how many irregularities
involving controlled substances

20:09.040 --> 20:10.520
have occurred at the St Eligius?

20:10.520 --> 20:11.560
Objection.

20:11.560 --> 20:13.720
The question doesn't relate
to the case at hand.

20:13.720 --> 20:15.280
Dr Priscilla,

20:15.280 --> 20:18.440
I'm trying to elicit the context
in which this event took place.

20:18.440 --> 20:19.520
I'll allow it.

20:19.520 --> 20:22.760
How many other irregularities
are you aware of?

20:22.760 --> 20:24.800
On the part
of the professional staff,

20:24.800 --> 20:27.600
there have been other incidents,
but when we find out about them,

20:27.600 --> 20:29.960
we try to put a stop to it
as quickly as we can.

20:29.960 --> 20:33.080
Mm-hmm. Can you confirm for us,
Dr Westphall,

20:33.080 --> 20:37.000
that Peter White has had a history
of substance abuse?

20:37.000 --> 20:38.320
Dr White completed

20:38.320 --> 20:41.640
a drug rehabilitation programme
this summer. Quite successfully.

20:41.640 --> 20:44.400
Can you confirm for us that
Dr White was involved

20:44.400 --> 20:46.360
in numerous incidents
at the hospital,

20:46.360 --> 20:48.320
where his fitness
to practice medicine

20:48.320 --> 20:49.720
has been called into question?

20:49.720 --> 20:53.360
He's made remarkable progress, both
as a physician and a human being.

20:53.360 --> 20:55.560
Are you going to answer the question
or not?

20:55.560 --> 20:58.280
I don't know what you mean
by numerous.

20:58.280 --> 21:00.840
Well, isn't it true
that he once sold his sperm

21:00.840 --> 21:02.680
in order to support his drug habit?

21:02.680 --> 21:04.440
I have no idea.

21:04.440 --> 21:06.080
A copy of the receipt from the lab.

21:06.080 --> 21:09.640
How do you know what he spent
the money for?

21:09.640 --> 21:13.640
Can you confirm that he was once
involved in an automobile accident

21:13.800 --> 21:15.440
while under the influence of drugs,

21:15.440 --> 21:18.040
and that he was subsequently arrested
and held overnight?

21:18.040 --> 21:19.120
Objection.

21:19.120 --> 21:21.840
This whole line of questioning
has nothing to do with the case!

21:21.840 --> 21:22.880
Overruled.

21:22.880 --> 21:24.400
Please report on the incident.

21:24.400 --> 21:25.640
Yes, I was aware of it.

21:25.640 --> 21:28.200
Well, in view of all of this,
did you ever consider

21:28.200 --> 21:31.520
dropping Dr White from the
residency programme at St Eligius?

21:31.520 --> 21:35.200
These horror stories are at least
six months old. Now since that...

21:35.200 --> 21:38.320
All right. Did you consider
dropping him six months ago?

21:38.320 --> 21:39.800
I'm going to tell you something.

21:39.800 --> 21:42.520
This man has a remarkable gift
for a clinical diagnosis.

21:42.520 --> 21:45.320
It's a very precious gift,
it's just now growing into maturity.

21:45.320 --> 21:47.680
You're not answering the question,
Dr Westphall.

21:47.680 --> 21:50.080
Did you consider dropping
Dr White at the time?

21:50.080 --> 21:52.040
Yes, I did.

21:52.040 --> 21:56.040
That'll be all, Dr Westphall.

21:58.560 --> 22:00.520
How did it go?

22:00.520 --> 22:02.000
He got chewed alive.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.040
Yeah, they ask anything
about the case?

22:04.040 --> 22:06.400
They just kept hammering
away at White's personal life

22:06.400 --> 22:08.640
and all those nurses he slept with
behind his wife's back.

22:08.640 --> 22:10.160
and all those nurses he slept with
behind his wife's back.

22:10.160 --> 22:12.840
I can't believe it. What has that
got to do with anything?

22:12.840 --> 22:14.280
I'm really worried, Jack.

22:14.280 --> 22:16.720
I mean, suppose he panics
and decides to hang me?

22:16.720 --> 22:20.080
He's got to be pretty desperate,
who knows what he's going to say?

22:20.080 --> 22:21.360
Want a ride back?

22:21.360 --> 22:24.080
Yeah, I'll go crazy
hanging around here.

22:24.080 --> 22:27.120
So I referred her
to the family practice clinic.

22:27.120 --> 22:28.960
It's there on the chart.

22:28.960 --> 22:31.800
And the family practice clinic
was closed?

22:31.800 --> 22:33.960
That's right. So was the pharmacy.

22:33.960 --> 22:36.640
That why you didn't
write her a prescription?

22:36.640 --> 22:39.760
She wasn't my patient.
Her daughter was.

22:39.760 --> 22:43.280
Little late to realise that now,
isn't it, Doctor?

22:43.280 --> 22:44.920
I was thinking mostly of the child.

22:44.920 --> 22:48.400
She needed her mother's care,
I wanted to be sure she got it.

22:48.400 --> 22:50.120
Can you tell us, Dr White,

22:50.120 --> 22:54.120
why all Class 3 drugs
are kept under lock and key?

22:55.520 --> 22:57.640
Because of their potential
for abuse.

22:57.640 --> 23:01.600
To prevent this very kind
of casual distribution.

23:01.600 --> 23:03.920
I put in over a thousand hours
in the ER.

23:03.920 --> 23:05.680
I don't distribute drugs casually.

23:05.680 --> 23:09.440
The fact that you had to go
through two locks to get them

23:09.440 --> 23:11.240
didn't that make you think twice?

23:11.240 --> 23:14.560
I wish it had.

23:14.560 --> 23:18.560
At what point in all of this did you
approach Nurse Daniels for the keys?

23:19.080 --> 23:21.960
Dr Priscilla, there's one thing
I'd like to clarify before...

23:21.960 --> 23:24.560
You'll have plenty of chances
to clear things up

23:24.560 --> 23:28.080
when Mr Michaelson's
asking the questions.

23:28.080 --> 23:29.960
It was three o'clock in the morning,

23:29.960 --> 23:32.400
I'd been at the hospital
since noon the previous day.

23:32.400 --> 23:36.000
Just a simple, coherent answer,
Dr White.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.280
What was the question?

23:38.280 --> 23:42.280
At what point did you approach
Nurse Daniels for the keys?

23:43.640 --> 23:45.480
She was busy treating
a burn patient,

23:45.480 --> 23:47.000
a guy who'd been set on fire.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.480
So I looked around and I noticed
that the keys were pinned

23:49.480 --> 23:51.320
to her sweater over the back
of a chair.

23:51.320 --> 23:52.600
And then what did you do?

23:52.600 --> 23:55.800
She was in the middle
of an emergency procedure, Mr Tanny.

23:55.800 --> 23:58.200
I couldn't justify interrupting her.

23:58.200 --> 24:02.200
And then what did you do?

24:02.800 --> 24:04.280
So I...

24:04.280 --> 24:06.160
I took the keys from the sweater,

24:06.160 --> 24:08.560
and I removed the drugs
from the cabinet myself.

24:08.560 --> 24:12.560
I have no further questions.

24:18.640 --> 24:22.640
This is supposed to be a rush job,
Lee.

24:25.360 --> 24:27.560
What do I have to do
to get your attention?

24:27.560 --> 24:28.680
You have to face me.

24:28.680 --> 24:31.360
I don't have the time!

24:31.360 --> 24:33.000
I don't know this machine.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.200
I had to trace the wiring by hand.

24:35.200 --> 24:37.560
Last week you overexposed
the chest films,

24:37.560 --> 24:39.480
today you had to trace the wires.

24:39.480 --> 24:41.920
It's always something with you,
isn't it?

24:41.920 --> 24:43.880
That film was not labelled properly.

24:43.880 --> 24:45.760
Why don't you take a break?

24:45.760 --> 24:46.920
I just had a break.

24:46.920 --> 24:48.640
Well, then take another one,
I'm busy.

24:48.640 --> 24:51.000
If you're trying to make me quit,
it won't work.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.960
I'm just trying to get the job done.

24:53.960 --> 24:56.000
Hey, what is your problem?

24:56.000 --> 24:58.320
You want to know what my problem is?

24:58.320 --> 25:02.320
My problem is people like you,
who are constantly...

25:04.960 --> 25:07.040
Hey, you are nuts, buddy.

25:07.040 --> 25:08.680
I'm staying right where I am.

25:08.680 --> 25:12.000
You understand? Right here.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.000
Wayne.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.960
W-A-Y-N-E.

25:16.960 --> 25:19.160
Yeah, I'm an old friend
of George's from college,

25:19.160 --> 25:22.400
but I haven't seen him
in a long time.

25:22.400 --> 25:24.480
Moved to Columbia?

25:24.480 --> 25:28.480
No, this can't wait till '85.

25:30.600 --> 25:32.200
Dr Craig.

25:32.200 --> 25:34.240
Hey, Dr Craig.

25:34.240 --> 25:35.560
What is it, Ehrlich?

25:35.560 --> 25:38.480
I have a little problem. I was
wondering if you could help with it.

25:38.480 --> 25:41.720
Ehrlich, I'm sure there will be
a lot of little problems

25:41.720 --> 25:44.160
right up to the ceremony.

25:44.160 --> 25:46.200
If I can help in any way, I will.

25:46.200 --> 25:49.040
Oh, boy.

25:49.040 --> 25:51.840
OK, um...

25:51.840 --> 25:53.000
I have this friend.

25:53.000 --> 25:57.000
And he's asked a big favour of
someone who's very important to him.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.280
But it turns out,

25:58.280 --> 26:02.280
this other person totally
misunderstood what my friend meant.

26:02.280 --> 26:03.480
Now...

26:03.480 --> 26:07.080
the problem is that my friend doesn't
want to hurt this person's feelings.

26:07.080 --> 26:09.080
But he's in a real pickle,

26:09.080 --> 26:12.520
and he's got to figure some way
to straighten it out. Um...

26:12.520 --> 26:15.360
You see, if he tells
this other person directly,

26:15.360 --> 26:19.360
it could cause a lot of, um,
embarrassment.

26:19.800 --> 26:20.640
Embarrassment, basically.

26:20.640 --> 26:22.080
Embarrassment, basically.

26:22.080 --> 26:26.080
OK. Fine, um...

26:26.400 --> 26:29.880
I can't have you as my best man.

26:29.880 --> 26:33.880
This car's full. Take the next one.

26:35.360 --> 26:38.680
Then what was all that crap
about in the OR?

26:38.680 --> 26:41.120
OK. You see, I was going to ask you

26:41.120 --> 26:44.800
if Roberta and I could have
our wedding at your home.

26:44.800 --> 26:48.400
It's just that Dogger and I have been
best friends since junior high.

26:48.400 --> 26:50.080
No, no, it's OK.

26:50.080 --> 26:52.200
I'm very sorry about
the misunderstanding.

26:52.200 --> 26:52.800
It's fine.

26:52.800 --> 26:54.920
It's fine.

26:54.920 --> 26:56.480
Ehrlich, did you hear what I said?

26:56.480 --> 26:57.920
Sir?

26:57.920 --> 26:59.400
I said it's fine.

26:59.400 --> 27:02.040
I mean, just work out the details
with Mrs Craig.

27:02.040 --> 27:03.960
The details?

27:03.960 --> 27:07.000
You want to have your wedding
at my place, don't you?

27:07.000 --> 27:08.200
Do you mean it?

27:08.200 --> 27:10.400
Well, look, if you want someone
for a best man

27:10.400 --> 27:13.280
who has a similar outlook on life,
a similar vision...

27:13.280 --> 27:15.160
a guy named Dogger...

27:15.160 --> 27:17.800
Well, I guess that's
perfectly understandable.

27:17.800 --> 27:19.800
Dr Craig.

27:19.800 --> 27:22.160
I just want you to know
that if I ever get married again,

27:22.160 --> 27:26.160
I want to have you as my best man.

27:33.360 --> 27:34.520
Rough, huh?

27:34.520 --> 27:38.520
Yeah, it was the pits. But I think
I've still got a pretty good chance.

27:39.200 --> 27:41.880
I took care of it.
You got nothing to worry about.

27:41.880 --> 27:45.720
Now, listen, listen. I told them the
keys were pinned to your sweater.

27:45.720 --> 27:47.680
All right? Just in case
somebody ever asks you.

27:47.680 --> 27:48.320
All right? Just in case
somebody ever asks you.

27:48.320 --> 27:52.320
All right? Just in case
somebody ever asks you.

27:52.840 --> 27:55.480
I didn't know Roberta
and Victor were so serious.

27:55.480 --> 27:58.440
I just hope she's prepared
for the white glove inspections.

27:58.440 --> 27:59.600
I lived with him.

27:59.600 --> 28:01.760
Obsessive compulsive
like you wouldn't believe.

28:01.760 --> 28:03.600
He makes my mother look like a slob!

28:03.600 --> 28:05.000
Wish I knew what to give him.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.320
I think they could really
use an observation deck

28:07.320 --> 28:08.560
in the bedroom for Dr Weiss.

28:08.560 --> 28:09.480
(LAUGHS)

28:09.480 --> 28:13.160
(LAUGHS)

28:13.160 --> 28:15.240
You wouldn't know where we can
score some dope, would you?

28:15.240 --> 28:16.600
You wouldn't know where we can
score some dope, would you?

28:16.600 --> 28:18.680
We're talking smoke here.

28:18.680 --> 28:21.120
Believe it or not,
it's for Dr Auschlander.

28:21.120 --> 28:23.160
Sure, Fiscus, and I'm running
for lieutenant governor(!)

28:23.160 --> 28:24.280
Sure, Fiscus, and I'm running
for lieutenant governor(!)

28:24.280 --> 28:26.760
Mm-hm. The man's got to be
at least 70 years old.

28:26.760 --> 28:29.440
I have no place to turn,
and the guy's in kind of a hurry.

28:29.440 --> 28:32.960
Oh, I get it. Because I'm black
and happen to live in the ghetto,

28:32.960 --> 28:35.960
you automatically figure I can
get my hands on some drugs, right?

28:35.960 --> 28:37.680
You're right. And I'm sorry.

28:37.680 --> 28:41.080
But the guy's suffering
the side effects of chemo.

28:41.080 --> 28:42.600
I don't know.

28:42.600 --> 28:46.600
It's not going to be easy.
Let me see what I can do.

28:49.240 --> 28:53.240
Lee!

28:54.720 --> 28:57.400
Good news. I just spoke to Scottie.

28:57.400 --> 28:58.760
She'd love to meet you.

28:58.760 --> 29:00.040
So what?

29:00.040 --> 29:01.360
Aren't you pleased?

29:01.360 --> 29:02.920
It wouldn't work out anyhow.

29:02.920 --> 29:05.720
It's been this way all my life
and always will be this way.

29:05.720 --> 29:07.280
I am always going to lose.

29:07.280 --> 29:10.040
Take it easy. What's the problem?

29:10.040 --> 29:11.920
I can't take my supervisor any more.

29:11.920 --> 29:13.440
He hates me.

29:13.440 --> 29:17.200
The chief of surgery here
never gives me the time of day.

29:17.200 --> 29:19.840
Insults every chance he gets!

29:19.840 --> 29:23.120
Last week I saved his feet
from frostbite.

29:23.120 --> 29:24.800
He still treats me like gravel!

29:24.800 --> 29:26.880
So why do you stay here?
It's stupid.

29:26.880 --> 29:29.520
No, no, no, no. It's logic.

29:29.520 --> 29:31.880
If I left in the face of his abuse,

29:31.880 --> 29:34.440
it would prove to him
that he's right.

29:34.440 --> 29:36.240
And he isn't.

29:36.240 --> 29:38.160
I have no intention of quitting.

29:38.160 --> 29:40.680
Al will have to get used to me.

29:40.680 --> 29:44.680
Maybe you should speak
to Dr Westphall.

29:44.840 --> 29:48.840
I want to do this on my own.

29:51.240 --> 29:52.000
KNOCK ON DOOR

29:52.000 --> 29:54.120
KNOCK ON DOOR

29:54.120 --> 29:55.520
Have you got a minute, sir?

29:55.520 --> 29:57.760
Of course.

29:57.760 --> 29:59.240
Hello, Luther.

29:59.240 --> 30:01.120
How's it going?

30:01.120 --> 30:05.120
Um, we managed to get our hands
on the cannabis.

30:06.880 --> 30:09.400
That's wonderful.

30:09.400 --> 30:11.400
I hope you didn't run any great risk.

30:11.400 --> 30:14.960
Oh, well, a friend of mine's uncle's
barber knows his way around

30:14.960 --> 30:16.280
pretty good.

30:16.280 --> 30:17.440
How much do I owe you?

30:17.440 --> 30:20.280
No, no, it's a get-well present
from the two of us.

30:20.280 --> 30:24.280
Oh...that's lovely.

30:26.800 --> 30:28.720
Well, thank you.

30:28.720 --> 30:31.720
There's a couple of them in there,
so you can take them home,

30:31.720 --> 30:35.720
put on your headphones and relax.

30:36.400 --> 30:40.400
So this is what the fuss
is all about, then?

30:40.480 --> 30:44.480
Anybody got a match?

30:48.680 --> 30:52.240
I don't know why you're so upset.
Everything's going great.

30:52.240 --> 30:54.280
How can you say that?

30:54.280 --> 30:56.840
Well, the best man thing's
all straightened out,

30:56.840 --> 30:58.800
and we have a whole week off
for the honeymoon,

30:58.800 --> 31:02.440
and we found a fabulous place
to have the wedding. So cheer up.

31:02.440 --> 31:05.680
I'm hysterical about
meeting your parents tomorrow.

31:05.680 --> 31:07.280
I know that.

31:07.280 --> 31:11.280
Everything's going to be OK.

31:14.760 --> 31:17.240
This is insane.

31:17.240 --> 31:21.240
OK, you know, ultimately
we have nothing to worry about.

31:21.720 --> 31:23.560
Are you kidding?

31:23.560 --> 31:26.680
I wanted them to meet you,
but this is ridiculous.

31:26.680 --> 31:29.640
I mean, they find out that we're not
getting married in Philadelphia,

31:29.640 --> 31:32.400
then announce that they're going to
spend the entire week here with us.

31:32.400 --> 31:33.920
then announce that they're going to
spend the entire week here with us.

31:33.920 --> 31:37.920
That's seven times longer
than I invited them for.

31:39.960 --> 31:42.120
I'm scared, Victor.

31:42.120 --> 31:44.000
I'm terrified I'm going to run away.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.720
If you're having second thoughts,
I want you to tell me about them.

31:46.720 --> 31:48.360
If you're having second thoughts,
I want you to tell me about them.

31:48.360 --> 31:49.840
It's not you, Victor.

31:49.840 --> 31:52.440
It's just that, well,
whenever I'm around my parents,

31:52.440 --> 31:54.640
I turn into this zombie, you see?

31:54.640 --> 31:58.320
I don't want to be like them
and so I end up being like nobody.

31:58.320 --> 32:00.240
Roberta.

32:00.240 --> 32:03.160
They think that I'm this
stupid little waif

32:03.160 --> 32:05.120
who's made all the wrong choices
in life.

32:05.120 --> 32:08.200
So naturally they assume our getting
married is part of the same pattern

32:08.200 --> 32:09.600
and by the time they leave,
I will too.

32:09.600 --> 32:11.320
and by the time they leave,
I will too.

32:11.320 --> 32:15.320
I  am  crazy.
And I'm about to run away.

32:18.040 --> 32:19.280
Victor, tie me up.

32:19.280 --> 32:21.600
I am not going to tie you up,
Roberta.

32:21.600 --> 32:23.760
I've got some gauze,
we could play Doctor.

32:23.760 --> 32:24.360
Forget it.

32:24.360 --> 32:25.440
Forget it.

32:25.440 --> 32:27.520
Not even dental floss.

32:27.520 --> 32:29.280
I guess I should've
seen Dr Weiss today.

32:29.280 --> 32:33.280
Forget Weiss, we've got to start
working these things out on our own.

32:33.600 --> 32:35.560
Oh, what do you want to bet
my mother shows up

32:35.560 --> 32:37.120
with a ticket for me
back to Philadelphia?

32:37.120 --> 32:39.160
with a ticket for me
back to Philadelphia?

32:39.160 --> 32:42.880
Really.

32:42.880 --> 32:44.800
I love you, Victor.

32:44.800 --> 32:48.800
I love you, honey.

32:58.000 --> 32:58.840
Victor?

32:58.840 --> 33:00.040
Victor?

33:00.040 --> 33:02.360
No.

33:02.360 --> 33:06.360
Not until we get married.

33:08.840 --> 33:10.080
OK, food.

33:10.080 --> 33:11.360
Er, cookies?

33:11.360 --> 33:13.600
Ah, forget about it, Sam.
I think what he needs

33:13.600 --> 33:16.040
is a jar of marshmallow fluff.

33:16.040 --> 33:20.040
(CACKLES)

33:20.480 --> 33:22.920
It just occurs to me... (CHUCKLES)

33:22.920 --> 33:26.920
here we are, three intelligent people
on this Earth...

33:29.040 --> 33:33.040
..and we can't find a single thing
to eat. (GIGGLES)

33:33.760 --> 33:37.200
This is some problem, huh? (LAUGHS)

33:37.200 --> 33:41.200
Th-th-this problem
is a million years old!

33:41.520 --> 33:45.520
(LAUGHS)

33:45.560 --> 33:49.240
Ever notice how these places
have a sort of buzz?

33:49.240 --> 33:51.600
Just try and keep it together,
Dr Auschlander,

33:51.600 --> 33:53.080
we don't want to create a scene.

33:53.080 --> 33:54.760
Quite right.

33:54.760 --> 33:56.840
But what I really need is a...

33:56.840 --> 34:00.280
chocolate Fudgsical bar,
do they still make them? (LAUGHS)

34:00.280 --> 34:03.040
Wayne, Wayne. Maybe we should
wait outside for you, OK?

34:03.040 --> 34:04.400
No, no, no, I'll be fine.

34:04.400 --> 34:08.040
We'll just go at this thing
systematically.

34:08.040 --> 34:10.480
Oh, Katherine always loved
beef jerky.

34:10.480 --> 34:12.280
(GIGGLES)

34:12.280 --> 34:14.440
Oh, and now Goobers!

34:14.440 --> 34:18.360
I-I-I truly am supposed
to be on a kind of diet.

34:18.360 --> 34:21.600
I wonder if you have any salt-free
buttermilk back there?

34:21.600 --> 34:25.080
Or some...raw...

34:25.080 --> 34:27.719
fresh liver? (LAUGHS)

34:27.719 --> 34:29.320
I guess that ought to do it.

34:29.320 --> 34:32.400
Excuse me, sir, are you all right?

34:32.400 --> 34:34.920
Medically speaking,
I'm under the influence

34:34.920 --> 34:36.639
of a mind-altering substance.

34:36.639 --> 34:39.000
Don't you know that
that's against the law?

34:39.000 --> 34:40.920
We have everything under control,
officer.

34:40.920 --> 34:43.080
Take my word for it, this is
a legitimate medical experiment.

34:43.080 --> 34:45.320
Take my word for it, this is
a legitimate medical experiment.

34:45.320 --> 34:48.360
When I was a little boy in New York,
my father used to take me

34:48.360 --> 34:50.080
to the Metropolitan Opera House.

34:50.080 --> 34:52.080
We always bought standing room,

34:52.080 --> 34:54.239
because we didn't have enough money
for seats.

34:54.239 --> 34:56.520
He's on chemotherapy
and it was driving him nuts,

34:56.520 --> 34:59.200
and the fact is, he is a doctor.
I am too. And...

34:59.200 --> 35:03.040
You sure don't look like a doctor.

35:03.040 --> 35:05.160
OK?

35:05.160 --> 35:09.160
I asked my father,
"Why are you crying, Pop?"

35:09.640 --> 35:12.280
And he turned to me and said...

35:12.280 --> 35:16.280
"Be quiet. Listen."

35:17.040 --> 35:19.240
If this guy's at 50,000 feet...

35:19.240 --> 35:21.000
We'll take real good care of him.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.760
I wouldn't want to see him
doing any driving in this condition.

35:23.760 --> 35:24.640
Absolutely not.

35:24.640 --> 35:25.920
Absolutely not.

35:25.920 --> 35:29.520
(LAUGHS) Wait till you get a taste
of this beef jerky!

35:29.520 --> 35:33.520
(CACKLES)

35:35.560 --> 35:37.240
I don't know where Victor is.

35:37.240 --> 35:40.120
He said he'd be here by 12:30.

35:40.120 --> 35:42.080
Victor Ehrlich.
Is that his real name?

35:42.080 --> 35:45.520
Now, the telegram should go out
the first thing tomorrow morning.

35:45.520 --> 35:48.400
Randall's composing the text.
Er... Flowers.

35:48.400 --> 35:50.400
That's a telephone call, darling.

35:50.400 --> 35:54.360
The obvious question marks
are the caterers, the orchestra...

35:54.360 --> 35:56.880
It's all been worked out, Dad.
Including the telegrams.

35:56.880 --> 35:58.720
I see.

35:58.720 --> 36:00.600
We sent funny postcards.

36:00.600 --> 36:01.840
They went out last week.

36:01.840 --> 36:02.880
Mm.

36:02.880 --> 36:06.880
KNOCK ON DOOR

36:07.440 --> 36:08.560
Forgive me, folks.

36:08.560 --> 36:12.240
There was a small emergency at the
hospital that needed my attention.

36:12.240 --> 36:13.480
Boy, very smart luggage.

36:13.480 --> 36:14.880
Louis Vuitton.

36:14.880 --> 36:17.680
(LAUGHS) Victor Ehrlich. Hello.

36:17.680 --> 36:21.560
Mom. Victor, I'd like you
to meet my mother, Judith.

36:21.560 --> 36:23.640
Oh, my gosh, Mrs Sloan.

36:23.640 --> 36:25.640
Look at this,
you two could be sisters.

36:25.640 --> 36:28.080
Thank you, Victor.

36:28.080 --> 36:28.760
Why don't we sit down?

36:28.760 --> 36:30.760
Why don't we sit down?

36:30.760 --> 36:32.240
Oh, thank you.

36:32.240 --> 36:36.000
You know, just before I came here,
I was with a patient.

36:36.000 --> 36:38.240
Look at this, will you?
How embarrassing.

36:38.240 --> 36:40.360
I was in such a hurry!

36:40.360 --> 36:44.360
As I understand it, this is
a city hospital you two work at?

36:46.760 --> 36:48.440
Yes, it's called St Eligius.

36:48.440 --> 36:50.040
And you do surgery there?

36:50.040 --> 36:51.760
All the time.

36:51.760 --> 36:53.280
I would've thought Boston General

36:53.280 --> 36:55.480
would be the place
to do a surgical residency.

36:55.480 --> 36:56.920
Well, it certainly has
the bigger name.

36:56.920 --> 36:57.960
Well, it certainly has
the bigger name.

36:57.960 --> 37:01.320
They tell me that
good surgical practice

37:01.320 --> 37:03.760
depends on making
the right contacts.

37:03.760 --> 37:06.480
Hey. This isn't the Inquisition.

37:06.480 --> 37:07.840
(LAUGHS)

37:07.840 --> 37:10.400
This is my fiance, Dad,
shouldn't we be celebrating?

37:10.400 --> 37:14.120
(LAUGHS) It's wonderful news,
it's...

37:14.120 --> 37:15.520
rather sudden, that's all.

37:15.520 --> 37:17.000
Sure.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.640
We're really very pleased.

37:18.640 --> 37:21.480
It's just that you're all we've got,

37:21.480 --> 37:24.480
and we've invested a great deal
in your happiness.

37:24.480 --> 37:26.880
Then why don't you ask me
how I feel?

37:26.880 --> 37:28.600
Roberta, we barely got here.

37:28.600 --> 37:31.440
I don't care if Victor works
in a doll hospital.

37:31.440 --> 37:35.440
I've never met a more natural
or honest man.

37:35.440 --> 37:36.960
I love Victor.

37:36.960 --> 37:40.960
And I want to spend my life with
him, and I feel very, very lucky.

37:42.720 --> 37:46.720
Mom, I'm getting married.

37:51.800 --> 37:54.280
KNOCK ON DOOR

37:54.280 --> 37:57.200
(CLEARS THROAT) You wanted to see me
about Lee Touvan?

37:57.200 --> 38:01.200
Yes, I did, Al, come in and sit down.

38:02.240 --> 38:04.120
I've been here six years.

38:04.120 --> 38:07.960
I've got zero budget, calluses
on my feet and a gutful of ulcers,

38:07.960 --> 38:11.360
but at least you always let me run
my own department, no interference.

38:11.360 --> 38:12.240
Now, all of a sudden...

38:12.240 --> 38:13.320
Now, all of a sudden...

38:13.320 --> 38:15.280
Al, I didn't order you
to hire this man.

38:15.280 --> 38:17.880
You were there at the interview.
Now give him a chance.

38:17.880 --> 38:21.480
I did. But he's just not...

38:21.480 --> 38:22.720
..normal.

38:22.720 --> 38:26.240
Now that's baloney and you know it.

38:26.240 --> 38:29.400
Al, we can't treat disabled people
like they're contagious.

38:29.400 --> 38:32.120
They have rights, they have feelings,
just like everyone else.

38:32.120 --> 38:34.720
And a hell of a lot more courage
in their day-to-day existence

38:34.720 --> 38:35.840
than you or I will ever know about.

38:35.840 --> 38:37.520
than you or I will ever know about.

38:37.520 --> 38:40.520
It's not Lee's fault either.
But you're punishing him for it.

38:40.520 --> 38:42.640
He needs more help
than I'm able to give him.

38:42.640 --> 38:44.480
I don't believe it.

38:44.480 --> 38:47.360
Now for the time being, your job
is going to be to give that man

38:47.360 --> 38:48.920
as much help as he needs. Clear?

38:48.920 --> 38:52.920
PHONE RINGS

38:54.120 --> 38:58.120
Yeah?

39:02.120 --> 39:06.000
Not a very dignified evening,
I'm afraid.

39:06.000 --> 39:07.920
But...

39:07.920 --> 39:11.200
thank you.

39:11.200 --> 39:12.400
Did you get any sleep?

39:12.400 --> 39:14.440
I hallucinated all night,
on top of which,

39:14.440 --> 39:15.560
the junk food really laid me low.

39:15.560 --> 39:16.640
the junk food really laid me low.

39:16.640 --> 39:18.800
This stuff may work
for some people, Wayne.

39:18.800 --> 39:22.800
But not for me.

39:24.120 --> 39:28.120
I had this recurring image that
I was in the middle of a battle.

39:28.280 --> 39:32.280
Two armies surging back and forth
across an open field.

39:33.160 --> 39:37.160
A cancer army consisting
of huge, buzzing insects.

39:39.640 --> 39:43.640
They had this terrifying ability
to regenerate.

39:47.280 --> 39:50.400
I'm going to try and fight
this battle again tonight

39:50.400 --> 39:54.400
without chemical enhancement.

39:55.040 --> 39:59.040
And this time, I have no intention
of losing.

39:59.520 --> 40:01.000
Well, you might as well flush
that stuff.

40:01.000 --> 40:02.200
Well, you might as well flush
that stuff.

40:02.200 --> 40:03.200
Unless of course you want to...

40:03.200 --> 40:07.200
Unless of course you want to...

40:08.400 --> 40:12.400
Just going to...flush it.

40:15.240 --> 40:16.680
You still in one piece?

40:16.680 --> 40:19.760
Oh. I get the feeling
your parents think I'm from Saturn.

40:19.760 --> 40:20.960
They do not.

40:20.960 --> 40:23.000
Victor, this was such
a breakthrough for me.

40:23.000 --> 40:25.360
Do you realise I've never,
ever told them how I felt?

40:25.360 --> 40:27.760
You were sensational. Now,
did you get them set up at The Ritz?

40:27.760 --> 40:29.440
You were sensational. Now,
did you get them set up at The Ritz?

40:29.440 --> 40:31.920
I convinced them to take the rest
of the week in Bermuda.

40:31.920 --> 40:32.960
Oh, boy.

40:32.960 --> 40:35.720
Yeah. Their flight leaves
in an hour. They're downstairs.

40:35.720 --> 40:37.000
Great.

40:37.000 --> 40:39.560
Look. I know you went through
the ringer at my place,

40:39.560 --> 40:41.280
but they'd like to say goodbye.

40:41.280 --> 40:45.280
OK.

40:48.800 --> 40:51.080
Did you talk to Al?

40:51.080 --> 40:53.640
I could've handled this myself,
believe me.

40:53.640 --> 40:55.800
Lee, we all need help
from time to time

40:55.800 --> 40:58.640
to get over the rough spots, right?
Now, don't be offended.

40:58.640 --> 41:01.800
I'm sorry, Dr Westphall. I'm just
so used to people looking down on me,

41:01.800 --> 41:03.600
either by being mean or patronising.

41:03.600 --> 41:06.280
I understand. And I'm not going
to tell you that those problems

41:06.280 --> 41:07.640
are going to go away.

41:07.640 --> 41:10.040
Then respect.
I'm like everybody else.

41:10.040 --> 41:12.200
That's right. I'll see you later.

41:12.200 --> 41:16.200
Later.

41:17.760 --> 41:19.920
Victor...

41:19.920 --> 41:23.200
All my life I've worked
with numbers.

41:23.200 --> 41:27.200
Sometimes I think it's a blessing,
sometimes a curse.

41:27.200 --> 41:28.640
Still, for whatever reason,

41:28.640 --> 41:32.640
putting things into equations,
somehow it all makes sense.

41:34.960 --> 41:36.920
The fact is...

41:36.920 --> 41:39.080
you surgeons are all...

41:39.080 --> 41:40.480
very temperamental.

41:40.480 --> 41:44.480
You put in terrible hours,
you work around chemicals all day.

41:45.520 --> 41:47.760
The bottom line is

41:47.760 --> 41:50.680
you'll never make as much
as your local newscaster.

41:50.680 --> 41:52.120
So what you're saying is...

41:52.120 --> 41:54.440
So what you're saying is...

41:54.440 --> 41:56.600
you dress like a carnival barker.

41:56.600 --> 41:59.840
I'm a bad risk?

41:59.840 --> 42:03.760
On paper, it would seem that way,
yes.

42:03.760 --> 42:05.640
But...

42:05.640 --> 42:08.880
It's obvious
that you love my daughter.

42:08.880 --> 42:10.600
Roberta evidently loves you.

42:10.600 --> 42:12.360
Yes.

42:12.360 --> 42:14.520
I guess that's more important
than money.

42:14.520 --> 42:16.560
I wouldn't know, really.

42:16.560 --> 42:20.560
You see, when Judith and I got
married, we were both very wealthy.

42:23.080 --> 42:24.120
Ah.

42:24.120 --> 42:26.920
Hello, Victor. We got these
at rather nice gift shop.

42:26.920 --> 42:29.120
Darling, I believe
the driver's waiting for us.

42:29.120 --> 42:30.240
Oh. Well...

42:30.240 --> 42:32.360
We'll see you at the wedding.

42:32.360 --> 42:33.720
Bye, Mrs Sloan.

42:33.720 --> 42:35.600
Oh, Victor, you're so formal.

42:35.600 --> 42:37.640
Call me Mother.

42:37.640 --> 42:39.080
Go ahead.

42:39.080 --> 42:40.720
OK...Mother. (CHUCKLES)

42:40.720 --> 42:42.520
Son.

42:42.520 --> 42:46.520
Yes.

42:47.320 --> 42:49.440
Judith.

42:49.440 --> 42:50.320
Bye.

42:50.320 --> 42:53.040
Bye.

42:53.040 --> 42:56.280
Ah...

42:56.280 --> 42:58.440
Weren't they everything
I said they were?

42:58.440 --> 43:00.800
And more. (LAUGHS)

43:00.800 --> 43:02.760
But on the other hand,
these are the people

43:02.760 --> 43:04.920
we're going to be spending
Thanksgiving with.

43:04.920 --> 43:06.160
Good old Mom and Dad.

43:06.160 --> 43:09.120
They'll be back next week.

43:09.120 --> 43:13.120
Terrific(!)

43:15.080 --> 43:17.560
The last one of these
I saw was a dermoid cyst,

43:17.560 --> 43:20.440
but you'd need a mediastinoscopy
to be sure.

43:20.440 --> 43:21.720
Mm.

43:21.720 --> 43:24.000
You mean take a bite surgically.

43:24.000 --> 43:25.280
I'd show it to Dr Pennant
if I were you.

43:25.280 --> 43:26.320
I'd show it to Dr Pennant
if I were you.

43:26.320 --> 43:30.320
PHONE RINGS

43:30.600 --> 43:32.920
Yeah?

43:32.920 --> 43:35.720
Yeah.

43:35.720 --> 43:38.040
OK, I'll tell him.

43:38.040 --> 43:40.240
It's Alisa.

43:40.240 --> 43:44.240
Dr Westphall wants to talk to you.

43:54.360 --> 43:58.360
That's OK.

44:03.000 --> 44:06.520
I still can't believe it.

44:06.520 --> 44:09.280
Apparently the vote was unanimous.

44:09.280 --> 44:10.480
It's totally unfair.

44:10.480 --> 44:13.040
What they really hung him on
were those incidents from his past.

44:13.040 --> 44:17.040
What they really hung him on
were those incidents from his past.

44:18.040 --> 44:19.320
You heard?

44:19.320 --> 44:20.600
It's a tragedy.

44:20.600 --> 44:23.080
The fact is, he's just a scapegoat
for a larger problem

44:23.080 --> 44:24.640
the board has no idea how to handle.

44:24.640 --> 44:26.480
Well, with these restrictions,

44:26.480 --> 44:28.720
there's no way he can continue
in the emergency room.

44:28.720 --> 44:30.080
there's no way he can continue
in the emergency room.

44:30.080 --> 44:33.880
It's devastating. They'll report
their findings to every state board,

44:33.880 --> 44:36.520
all the malpractice
insurance companies.

44:36.520 --> 44:40.520
He'll be explaining this
for the rest of his life.

44:43.760 --> 44:47.760
(PANTS)

44:50.680 --> 44:53.440
Peter, I got a call from the clerk
at the board a few minutes ago.

44:53.440 --> 44:54.520
Yeah?

44:54.520 --> 44:56.920
I'm afraid it's bad news.

44:56.920 --> 45:00.240
They voted for formal censure.

45:00.240 --> 45:02.360
Formal censure?

45:02.360 --> 45:03.640
Two years probation

45:03.640 --> 45:07.640
and suspension of your authority
to write prescriptions.

45:07.760 --> 45:09.480
It's a highly political issue.

45:09.480 --> 45:12.400
Apparently the board felt they
couldn't let this go unpunished.

45:12.400 --> 45:15.960
No question, Peter, that you
were a victim of circumstance.

45:15.960 --> 45:18.920
And that there was no
malicious intent on your part.

45:18.920 --> 45:22.240
You do have the right to appeal
to the state courts,

45:22.240 --> 45:26.240
but in my experience no decision of
the board has ever been overturned.

45:26.720 --> 45:30.720
Frankly all it'll get you is lots of
aggravation and a huge legal bill.

45:31.880 --> 45:34.360
Does this mean you're...
going to get rid of me?

45:34.360 --> 45:36.360
No. I'm going to find a place
for you here,

45:36.360 --> 45:38.880
where the probation
won't get in your way.

45:38.880 --> 45:42.160
Look, I really appreciate
everything you've done for me.

45:42.160 --> 45:43.960
I'm really very sorry, Peter.

45:43.960 --> 45:47.960
(QUIETLY) Thanks a lot.

46:04.160 --> 46:08.160
(SOBS)

46:28.240 --> 46:54.000
