Besides, those acrylics

02:29.970 --> 02:32.005
- Wait... break up?
- You heard me!

02:32.040 --> 02:34.875
A side-bitch tired of being
pushed to the side, Jamal... oh!

02:34.910 --> 02:38.005
- Aw, what's up, girl?
<i>- Ew!</i>

02:38.015 --> 02:41.575
You know what, Jamal?
A bitch might not look like Rihanna...

02:41.585 --> 02:44.715
Nothin' like her... well, maybe
a little in the beat-up pics?

02:44.750 --> 02:45.855
But you ain't gon' find nobody

02:45.890 --> 02:49.225

02:50.895 --> 02:54.025
Aww, hell naw, Jamal!
It's over!

02:54.060 --> 02:56.995
You better call Tyrone.

02:57.030 --> 02:58.325
Who the hellz is Tyrone?

02:58.335 --> 03:01.935
I don't know, but I do know
you got curved by yo side boo.

03:01.970 --> 03:03.965
Man, these hos ain't loyal.

03:03.975 --> 03:07.175
<i>Jamal, how you got a side
boo with no main boo anyway?</i>

03:07.210 --> 03:10.105
Wouldn't that make Medina
your main boo by default?

03:10.140 --> 03:13.515
I don't feel like doing side-bitch
word problems today, my nigs.

03:13.550 --> 03:16.115
My heart is heavier
than Medina's big titty.

03:16.150 --> 03:18.955
And my soul is blacker
than the little one.

03:18.990 --> 03:19.655
We know, homey.

03:19.690 --> 03:22.225
That's why we finna take you
somewhere to cheer you up.

Mm-hmm, whatever.

03:30.635 --> 03:31.825
Have fun, gentlemen.

03:38.140 --> 03:42.275
Coming to the stage,
give it up for Tupaquia!

03:42.310 --> 03:43.975
"Tupaquia? "
What kind of name is that?

03:44.010 --> 03:47.275
It's a stripper name,
like Sparkle or Amber Rose.

03:47.285 --> 03:50.745
Her momma must of
been a hella Pac fan.

03:57.390 --> 04:00.855
- Nah bro, it is Tupac!
- Pac is dead, my nig.

04:00.865 --> 04:03.395
And even if he was alive, ain't
no way my favorite rapper would be

04:03.430 --> 04:05.695
a shake booty bitch
at The Mooseknuckle.

04:05.730 --> 04:09.505
I only got one word...
"Datassdoe."

04:16.375 --> 04:18.845
Jamal, don't be mercy
tippin' the mud ducks.

04:18.880 --> 04:22.115
- Wait for dem [bleep]ables to come through.
- Tupaquia ain't no mud duck.

04:22.150 --> 04:26.885
She's a beautiful, black swan,
with a curvaceous tail feather.

04:27.625 --> 04:29.585
I'm tellin' y'all, that's Tupac!

04:29.620 --> 04:31.525
<i>Look, she got the same bald head,</i>

04:31.560 --> 04:34.195
<i>same bandana,
same 60 bullet holes</i>

04:34.230 --> 04:36.125
Aw, man,
that's just a coincidence.

04:36.160 --> 04:38.495
Oh yeah?
What about the tats?

04:38.530 --> 04:41.165
- But dat ass doe...
- That ain't Machiavelli, my dude.

04:41.200 --> 04:44.565
Watch, I'm finna prove it to you.
Yo, homey, where you from?

04:44.575 --> 04:48.875
Westside, mother[bleep]er.
And I'm on my period, partna.

04:48.910 --> 04:51.545

<i>Mmm-mm-mm.

doing a drive-by in a Prius!

05:08.830 --> 05:11.295
<i>Lies! Nigs don't even drive Prii.</i>

05:11.330 --> 05:15.065

05:15.770 --> 05:16.705

05:16.740 --> 05:18.635
What happened to your big-ass,
deluxtable titties, Mrs. Milk?

05:18.670 --> 05:21.505

deluxtable titties, Mom?

05:24.310 --> 05:29.085
Oh, uh... let's just say,
somebody kept their promise.

05:39.260 --> 05:39.925
of dem cheeks.

05:39.960 --> 05:43.425
Look, Tupaquia is Tupac!
Insides and outsides.

05:43.460 --> 05:45.735
I mean think about it,
he faked his own death,

05:45.770 --> 05:48.195
dropped 20 albums from
a compound in Thailand,

05:48.205 --> 05:49.835
and now with the
collapse of the music biz,

05:49.870 --> 05:52.775
he tryin' to re-brand
himself as an empowered bitch,

05:52.810 --> 05:53.905
making his bread on that pole.

05:53.940 --> 05:56.075
- Milk, that is not Tupac...
- That is Tupac, homey...

05:57.480 --> 05:58.975
Oh, I see what's goin' on.

05:59.010 --> 06:01.945
Y'all want some peanut butter
to go with all that jelly-sy?

06:01.980 --> 06:03.785
- Aye what, homey?
- You trippin', Jamal.

06:03.820 --> 06:05.485
There are plenty more mooseknuckles

06:05.520 --> 06:06.755

he would miss all this good
coochie and beg me to come back.

06:21.950 --> 06:24.600

That's how you play hard to
get. I do it all the time.

06:29.760 --> 06:33.395

Randy is not gay.
He just looks out for his homes.

06:40.305 --> 06:42.165
Look, he just sent me a pic.

06:42.200 --> 06:45.065
Well, I don't need Jamal
to do no gay shit like that.

06:45.075 --> 06:46.505
I just want him to call me sometimes.

06:46.540 --> 06:49.505
He will, but not if you
break down and call him first.

06:49.540 --> 06:53.715
And can you please put
a bra on... that one?

06:56.115 --> 06:58.085
- Hey, Tupaquia!
- I remember you.

06:58.120 --> 07:00.285
You that fat dude that

07:02.020 --> 07:05.425
- Yeah, but you can call me Jamal.
- Sorry, Jamal, I'm busy.

07:05.460 --> 07:07.725
Still counting all these
damn nickels and dimes

07:07.760 --> 07:08.695
you gave me the other night.

07:08.730 --> 07:10.395
Do I look like a Coinstar to you, nigga?

07:10.430 --> 07:14.435
I just came to tell you I had
a really good time, Tupaquia.

07:14.470 --> 07:15.165
And I have to admit,

07:15.200 --> 07:18.705
I had a couple of cream dreams
thinkin' about you last night.

07:18.740 --> 07:19.935
- Is that right?
- Yep.

07:19.945 --> 07:23.675
But I'd really like to see
what you like on the inside.

07:23.710 --> 07:26.745
Damn, ain't nobody ever
wanted my insides before.

07:26.780 --> 07:29.245
I mean the insides of
these cheeks of course,

07:29.280 --> 07:30.085
but that's about it.

07:30.120 --> 07:32.015
Speaking of cheeks, you
want a private dance?

07:32.050 --> 07:34.715
What you think I brought this for?

07:34.725 --> 07:36.955
Hobbit strippin' is some bullshit!

07:36.990 --> 07:39.955
Come on, get your head
in the game, Bilbo!

07:39.965 --> 07:41.195
You know what Tupaquia?

07:41.230 --> 07:43.325
I feel like we had a real connection.

07:43.335 --> 07:46.065
<i>Like a love at first
twerk type of thing.</i>

07:46.100 --> 07:47.995
But you don't even know me, partna.

07:48.005 --> 07:50.505
Yeah, but I can get to know you.

07:50.540 --> 07:53.605
You a sweet mother[bleep]er,
you know that?

07:53.640 --> 07:57.645
I been told. But, hey,
Tupaquia, are we almost done?

07:57.680 --> 08:00.045
I think I'm gettin' concussioned.

08:00.080 --> 08:01.645
Naw nigga, you got two more songs.

08:01.680 --> 08:04.515
Then you're taking me
for ice cream, partna!

08:04.550 --> 08:07.215
That's why automatic
soap dispensers are racist.

08:07.225 --> 08:09.910
They have been programmed by
the man to systematically deprive

08:09.911 --> 08:12.595
the black man of his antibacterial
and moisturizing rights.

08:12.630 --> 08:15.265
- Uh, sanitation segregation?
- Exactly.

08:15.300 --> 08:16.695
Oh, that's dirty, homes.

08:16.730 --> 08:20.074
Hey, Malik, you know shit.
Is Tupac still alive?

08:21.105 --> 08:23.005
You really wanna know?

08:23.040 --> 08:25.975
Okay, look, we all know
about 'Pac's affiliation

08:26.010 --> 08:27.005
with the Black Panthers, right?

08:27.040 --> 08:28.805
But not only was he a threat to the CIA,

08:28.840 --> 08:31.105
the Illuminati, and the
unconscious black man,

08:31.115 --> 08:33.565
he was just about to revolutionize
music by bringing attention

08:33.566 --> 08:36.015
to the inequality and corruption
in the world. Furthermore...

08:36.049 --> 08:38.554
Goddamn, just tell me
what happened to bruh!

08:38.590 --> 08:40.493
Okay, bring it in.

08:41.125 --> 08:43.284
- Pac got shot.
- Man, you serious?

08:43.294 --> 08:44.755
Yep. On the strip in Vegas.

08:44.790 --> 08:47.325
11:15 p.m.
It was a travesty.

08:47.360 --> 08:50.395
- Man, you just wasted our time.
- I got information on Biggie too.

08:50.430 --> 08:53.465
Jam Master Jay, Pimp C,
Natalee Holloway,

08:53.500 --> 08:56.635
Chandra Levy, the Lindbergh baby.
What you need?

08:56.670 --> 09:00.835
"You are a strong, black woman.
You can do bad all by yourself."

09:00.845 --> 09:02.845
I don't wanna do bad all by myself.

09:02.880 --> 09:06.815
I wanna do bad with Jamal.
I'ma call him.

09:06.850 --> 09:07.915
Medina, no!

09:07.950 --> 09:10.438
- Siri, call Jamal.
- Don't call him.

09:10.550 --> 09:11.955
Bitch, I said call him!

09:11.990 --> 09:13.915
<i>Calling.
Please don't hurt Siri.</i>

09:13.925 --> 09:16.725
<i>Jamal is not in right now.</i>

- Oh, yeah!

09:21.630 --> 09:22.525
<i>♪ Call him ♪</i>

09:22.560 --> 09:25.695
Then she told me to call Tyrone.
And I don't even know a Tyrone.

09:25.730 --> 09:29.065
So it's over between y'all, right?
'Cause I need all eyes on me.

09:29.100 --> 09:33.140
Yep, it ain't nothin'
to cut that bitch off.

09:33.175 --> 09:35.575
I don't know if you can handle
this unconditional love, Jamal.

09:35.610 --> 09:38.875
I mean, I ain't like all these
other square-ass hoes out here.

09:38.910 --> 09:41.245
So if you wanna leave
now, I ain't mad at ya.

09:41.280 --> 09:44.615
What, just 'cause you grind
on dudes' laps every night

09:44.650 --> 09:47.985
and occasionally give brain in the back?
That's just yo nine to five.

09:48.020 --> 09:49.725
I-I like you for you, Tupaquia.

09:49.760 --> 09:51.425
Well that's good to know, homey.

09:51.460 --> 09:54.525
'Cause I'd hate to get all
emotionally invested in you and shit,

09:54.560 --> 09:56.495
only to find out I'm just a side boo.

14:09.465 --> 14:11.165
Okay, so check this out, my dude,

14:14.510 --> 14:16.545
<i>You know I hate snitchin',
but lemme tell you something.</i>

14:16.580 --> 14:18.375
<i>Everybody out here

14:18.410 --> 14:21.885
<i>When they know off top, I'm
the nigga that protected Tupac.</i>

14:21.920 --> 14:22.585

14:46.640 --> 14:49.805

15:27.185 --> 15:30.445

- Yep! I mean... I hit myself up.

15:30.455 --> 15:32.515

Just do what she says, guys.
She's crazy!

16:15.330 --> 16:19.995
You right, maybe I am crazy.
But you know what else?

16:20.005 --> 16:23.435

16:23.470 --> 16:25.635
Medina?
You lookin' kinda sexy.

16:25.670 --> 16:27.605
Tupaquia, let's have a strip off.

16:27.640 --> 16:29.875
You win, Jamal stays with yo coochie.

16:29.910 --> 16:32.753
I win, he's comin' home with mines.

16:32.788 --> 16:36.415
Look at this, notorious P.I.G.
wants to have a booty battle.

16:36.450 --> 16:38.315
Don't let the jelly rolls fool you.

16:38.350 --> 16:41.415
- I know how to twerk 'em, ho.
- Let's go, partna.

16:44.095 --> 16:48.225

Okay, Grimace, well,

17:05.609 --> 17:08.315
Ooh, girl!

17:10.484 --> 17:12.685
Medina, no!

17:12.720 --> 17:17.055
Oh shit, she 'bout to bring
the whole Mooseknuckle down.

17:17.089 --> 17:22.065
This one's for you, Jamaaaal...

17:25.665 --> 17:28.665
Somebody call the ambulance!

17:30.065 --> 17:32.365
Damn, what if she don't never wake up?

17:32.400 --> 17:34.835
I know what'll wake her up.

17:42.280 --> 17:43.905
- Did I win?
- Hell no.

17:43.915 --> 17:47.715
You might have lost the battle, girl,
but you did win the Jamal.

17:47.750 --> 17:50.015
I'm sorry for breakin'
up with you, Jamal.

17:50.050 --> 17:52.215
I just wanted to be your main boo.

17:52.250 --> 17:53.485
Main Boo is earned, not given.

17:53.520 --> 17:57.085
You know what, I guess calling
and stalking you all the time,

17:57.095 --> 17:58.655
booking open mics at Lo Lo's,

17:58.690 --> 18:00.425
spitting a hot 16 like Biggie Smalls,

18:00.460 --> 18:03.965
and booty battling Mooseknuckles
for you was just not enough.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.635
'Tis true. And I guess I
shouldn't have moved on so fast.

18:06.670 --> 18:09.135
- But you seen that ass, Medina...
- Jamal!

18:09.170 --> 18:11.805
I'm just playin'
wit you, my big chili Frito.

18:11.840 --> 18:14.945
You know she ain't got
nothi' on them back titties.

18:14.980 --> 18:18.375
Aye, Tupac had you
cupcakin' like Little Debbie.

18:18.410 --> 18:21.315
You was actin' kinda Drake-y, my nig.
You was shook.

18:21.350 --> 18:23.785
Nah, that was all a part of
the plan to get Medina back.

18:23.820 --> 18:25.855
Ain't nobody scared of no Tupaq...

18:25.890 --> 18:30.055
- Get in the car, mother[bleep]er!
- Okay. Later, my nigs.

18:32.355 --> 18:34.155
Damn. Maybe it is Tupac.

18:34.165 --> 18:37.495
Uh, Tupaquia, why
you wearing that dress?

18:37.530 --> 18:39.832
We on our way to Mexico
to tie the eternal knot

18:39.833 --> 18:42.465
of mother[bleep]in' love.
If you got a problem wit that,

18:42.500 --> 18:44.805
I hear heaven got a
ghetto for you, partna!

18:44.840 --> 18:47.435
Nope, j-j-just makin'
sure we was matchin'.

18:47.445 --> 18:50.305
Look, Jamal, I know I'm marrying
you against yo will at gun point,

18:50.315 --> 18:53.275
but it's the only way, since
you don't wanna do it on yo own.

18:53.285 --> 18:55.745
And you did say you
like me for who I am,

18:55.780 --> 18:57.845
- so here I am, nigga.
- Tupaquia, that was a lie.

18:57.855 --> 19:01.285
It's what dudes say to not
sound so, uh, "superofficial."

19:01.320 --> 19:04.255
I was really just in love
with that waist to cake ratio.

19:04.290 --> 19:05.495
So you was playin' me!

19:05.530 --> 19:07.855
You think Tupaquia is
some kinda game, Jamal,

19:07.865 --> 19:11.165
that you can just download
on your phone for $9.99

19:11.200 --> 19:13.265
and just play all you want, huh?

19:13.300 --> 19:16.465
I'm sorry, Tupaquia.
Dat booty doe.

19:16.475 --> 19:20.575
Well, if I can't have you,
Jamal, I guess nobody will.

19:20.610 --> 19:22.675
Westside mother...

19:22.710 --> 19:27.145
Yeah, yeah, take that, take
that, I thought I told you.

19:27.180 --> 19:27.875
Damn, big Suge!

19:27.885 --> 19:31.915
[bleep] you, Diddy, you
know I can't see, nigga!

19:31.950 --> 19:35.025
Tupaquia!
I'm sorry it had to end like this.

19:35.060 --> 19:38.225
- I didn't mean to hurt you.
- I know, Jamal.

19:38.260 --> 19:40.025
And I still wish I
could have shot yo ass.

19:40.060 --> 19:43.965
But since my spine is severed
and I'm coughing up blood,

19:44.000 --> 19:46.095
let's just call it even.

19:46.130 --> 19:49.365
Don't you die on me, Tupaquia!

19:49.400 --> 19:51.805
Don't worry about me.
I been here before.

19:51.840 --> 19:54.475
I'll be fine.
Go be with your fat bitch.

19:54.510 --> 19:56.745
Y'all good for each other.

19:56.780 --> 19:59.115
