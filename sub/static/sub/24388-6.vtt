[Tim] They called me a madman.

00:50.925 --> 00:54.763
Mixing fruit cereal
with peanut butter cereal?

00:54.846 --> 00:59.642
[gasps] Dr. Tim, even a cereal scientist
like you couldn't be so mad!

00:59.726 --> 01:01.019
Couldn't I?

01:01.102 --> 01:04.022
Honestly, that really does sound
just completely nauseating.

Uh... in a minute.

01:43.228 --> 01:45.688
Okeydokey. Bring your brother down
when you're ready.

01:45.772 --> 01:49.359

01:49.442 --> 01:52.403
-[crying continues]
-Is that gonna be bad for babies?

01:52.487 --> 01:55.657
Not if I can help it.
I need a dossier from Baby Corp,

01:55.740 --> 02:00.370
see if we're dealing with a normal crybaby
or a Scooter Buskie-style problem child.

02:00.453 --> 02:03.748
Grab the monitor so I can call the office.
It's in the safe.

02:03.832 --> 02:07.127
[scoffs] I'm still eating breakfast.
You can get your own monitor.

02:07.710 --> 02:13.508
Uh, of course I can. Who said I couldn't?
[laughing] Who would say that? Morons.

02:14.092 --> 02:17.262
-Are you okay?
-You want me to get my own monitor?

02:53.673 --> 02:56.301
You can control people with your mind?

02:56.384 --> 02:58.845
No wonder your head is so big.

02:58.928 --> 03:02.307
No, I said I'm--
What's wrong with the size of my head?

03:02.390 --> 03:05.059
Do you have any idea
what "constipated" means?

03:05.143 --> 03:07.228
Yes?

03:07.312 --> 03:08.396
Very convincing.

03:09.564 --> 03:11.065
Okay, brass tacks version.

03:11.691 --> 03:15.111
I can't... go.

03:16.696 --> 03:17.614
Boom-boom.

03:18.865 --> 03:20.658
"Boom-boom" is poop.

03:20.742 --> 03:22.035
[laughs] You said "poop."

03:22.660 --> 03:27.332
[gasps] You can't poop! That's awful!
Of course I'll get your monitor for you!

03:27.415 --> 03:28.917
I'm more embarrassed than anything.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.503

Got a crying baby in my territory.

03:52.982 --> 03:56.486
Oh, wow.
Yeah, real four-alarm wailer right there.

03:57.028 --> 04:00.907
Run the factory specs for me. I wanna know
if this is gonna be a "situation."

04:00.990 --> 04:03.701
Will do. Give me ten.
Catch you back, Beebs.

04:03.785 --> 04:05.203

04:05.286 --> 04:09.791
Ugh! Nothing I can't muscle through
with a good day's work. So keep it quiet.

04:09.874 --> 04:13.169
-No one else needs to know about this.
-Not even Mom?

04:13.253 --> 04:15.129
-Is Mom someone else?
-Yes?

04:15.213 --> 04:16.923
Then no.

04:17.006 --> 04:21.386

from Mom. She's a mom.

-It's your first sick day.
-Sick days are for the weak and unionized.

I just need to work-- [screams]
Cramping, cramping!

05:20.278 --> 05:25.158
No, Dad is right. You're all stressed.
Probably because you work all the time.

05:25.241 --> 05:29.162
And stress gives your poop sticky claws,
and the claws grab your inside,

05:29.245 --> 05:32.206
and the poops go,
"Grah! We're not leaving!"

05:32.290 --> 05:34.792
[laughs] Talking poop.

05:35.376 --> 05:38.337
I am positive that's not how
the human body works.

05:38.421 --> 05:43.051
So, sick day!
It's the best way to relax and get better.

05:43.134 --> 05:45.303
We can watch game shows all morning.

05:45.386 --> 05:48.890
It's your summer vacation, Templeton.
You watch TV every day.

05:48.973 --> 05:49.807
Besides,

05:49.891 --> 05:52.602
-how am I supposed to relax with...

05:52.685 --> 05:56.647
Ugh, it's a human car alarm!
And why didn't Mom know about this kid?

05:56.731 --> 05:59.484
-Why should she?
-Mommies always know.

05:59.567 --> 06:03.321
New babies are the measuring stick
to make sure their baby is superior.

06:03.404 --> 06:07.784
No, something's wrong here. [groans]

06:09.118 --> 06:10.244

If I help with this crying baby thing,
you'll take the sick day?

I'll reopen discussions.

06:16.292 --> 06:19.629
[shouts] Easy!
I feel like I'm gonna pop a seam.

06:22.298 --> 06:24.133
Can't tell where it's coming from.

06:24.926 --> 06:29.347
I need my monitor, two walkie-talkies,
binoculars, and a favor.

-Not possible. Keep searching.

Where's that background
on the new arrival, Hendershot?

06:43.277 --> 06:45.738
Hang on. Just got your neighborhood file.

06:46.531 --> 06:49.242

to shut its mouth?

06:49.325 --> 06:51.828

Steady, Timmy. Hendershot,
at least give me a home address.

07:02.505 --> 07:07.176
Hmm. Uh, Beebs, there is no new baby
in your neighborhood.

07:07.260 --> 07:11.305
What? No, that's a baby cry.
Nobody else makes a sound like...

07:27.029 --> 07:29.449
It's... a copycat.

07:29.907 --> 07:32.743
[laughs] I didn't even mean it like that.

07:32.827 --> 07:34.203
[suspenseful music playing]

07:34.287 --> 07:36.622
There's more than one of them.

-[woman] My baby? That's your baby!

[overlapping chatter]

07:57.685 --> 07:59.687
What's happening?

08:00.313 --> 08:03.399
We got pockets of baby outrage
blooming all over town.

08:03.483 --> 08:04.859
More copycats?

08:04.942 --> 08:08.446
Gotta be at least-- This little piggy,
this little piggy, this little piggy...

08:08.529 --> 08:10.948
Five, maybe more.
I ran out of little piggies.

08:11.032 --> 08:13.576
It's that maniac, Bootsy Calico.

08:13.659 --> 08:17.079
He must've trained a small army
of these shrieking pretenders.

08:17.163 --> 08:20.208
Better get your field team on this,
double-time. [shouts]

08:20.291 --> 08:23.711
-Way ahead of you--
-No! You are a sick baby.

08:23.794 --> 08:27.089
You're too stressed, and you need to relax
and watch TV with me.

08:27.173 --> 08:30.176
-Back, Templeton. Let me-- [screams]
-[stomach gurgles]

08:30.259 --> 08:33.471
Let me work through this.
I'm on a tight schedule.

08:33.554 --> 08:36.098

with prune juice any minute.

[Dad grunting]

08:41.145 --> 08:44.774
-Prune.
-There has to be an easier way to do this.

08:44.857 --> 08:48.027
I'm not paying
for some fancy store-bought juicer!

08:51.113 --> 08:55.076

-You okay there, BB?
-My baby brother is taking a sick day

Did something clog your schnitzel chute?
That's terrible-arious.

09:32.446 --> 09:38.035
Mega Fat CEO Baby's sympathy
is tainted with amusement.

09:38.911 --> 09:43.666
It's not a problem. [grunts] My team
can still take care of these copycats.

09:43.749 --> 09:46.961
Party, party, celebration.
Love that good news.

09:49.046 --> 09:52.174
Of course, your field team will have
to stop the copycats without you

09:52.258 --> 09:54.844
because you're taking a si-si-si-sick day.

09:58.222 --> 10:01.017
I just need... [grunts] ...to work.

10:01.100 --> 10:05.688
Oh, oh, oh, no. No work
until you get the poo-poos out.

10:05.771 --> 10:08.399
-Hmm?
-If I catch you working, you're fired.

10:08.482 --> 10:10.735
If your team fails without you,
you're also fired.

10:10.818 --> 10:14.155
-What?
-Call it a catch number two.

10:14.238 --> 10:18.451
Have fun at home with your man-baby,
whatever his name is. I want to say Cody.

10:18.534 --> 10:21.120
-It's actually--
-Your name is now Cody.

10:24.665 --> 10:27.710
All right. Ooh!
Templeton, pace me back and forth.

10:27.793 --> 10:30.755
-Why?
-Because it's dramatic and you owe me.

10:31.839 --> 10:34.175
All right, these copycats are out there.

10:34.258 --> 10:37.345
They're moving, and they're damaging
our business more and more

10:37.428 --> 10:39.263
with every phony baby cry.

10:39.347 --> 10:43.684
How are we supposed to catch them all,
sir, even with the substitutes?

10:43.934 --> 10:47.355
-We're temporary!
-Turn me, hands on hips.

10:49.190 --> 10:50.900
You don't catch them all.

10:50.983 --> 10:52.735
You catch one copycat

10:52.818 --> 10:55.821
and make it lead you to the ringleader,
Bootsy Calico.

10:55.905 --> 10:57.573
Stop him, you stop them.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.241
-Brilliant!
-Can't lose!

10:59.659 --> 11:04.372
I'll join you as soon as I can, uh...
offshore my personal assets.

11:06.540 --> 11:09.293
Thank you for that disgusting
illustration, Templeton.

11:09.377 --> 11:12.505
-You're welcome.
-[Mom] Tim, is the baby upstairs?

11:12.588 --> 11:15.091
[Dad] We got the juice
that'll make your stool loose.

11:15.174 --> 11:16.550
-Juice?
-No juice, Jimbo.

-Don't.
