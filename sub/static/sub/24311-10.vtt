00:08.797 --> 00:11.432
Wow. We got great news, folks.

00:11.433 --> 00:12.967
As you may have heard,

00:12.968 --> 00:15.336
Robert Mueller merely
considers me a subject,

00:15.337 --> 00:18.572
not a target of his ongoing
criminal investigation.

00:18.573 --> 00:20.441
In other words, I'm off the hook!

00:20.442 --> 00:21.908
So you know what that means!

00:21.909 --> 00:25.179
Huge party hostel... hotel!

00:25.180 --> 00:28.182
FYI, if an attractive woman
shows up at your room

00:28.183 --> 00:30.518
with a Betamax video camera
strapped to her head,

00:30.519 --> 00:32.586
it's not the luckiest day of your life.

00:32.587 --> 00:34.821
On a more somber note,
we have to talk about

00:34.822 --> 00:37.458
the big divorce news
sending shock waves

00:37.459 --> 00:38.825
through the Trump family.

00:38.826 --> 00:41.461
Channing and Jenna Dewan Tatum
are splits-ville.

00:41.462 --> 00:44.164
Don Jr., would you like to say
a few words about the Tatums?

00:44.165 --> 00:46.767
- No, Dad!
- He's really broken up about it.

00:46.768 --> 00:50.270
Anyway, big announcement about
our new national security advisor.

00:50.271 --> 00:53.140
He's been called the
"Cruise Missile Crusader"

00:53.141 --> 00:57.109
by 137 Sinclair news anchors
speaking in unison.

00:57.110 --> 01:00.046
Mr. John Bolton!

01:00.047 --> 01:03.149
Our nation's future is so bright,

01:03.150 --> 01:05.652
we'll have to shield our eyes
from the blast wave!

01:05.653 --> 01:08.521
Now, everyone's nervous John
Bolton will make the Earth's

01:08.522 --> 01:11.390
surface as empty as Laura
Ingraham's commercial breaks,

01:11.391 --> 01:14.026
but John promises
he won't wage a war

01:14.027 --> 01:16.628
until he's bombed the hell
out of Amazon's headquarters.

01:16.629 --> 01:18.964
But enough about me
soft-launching a military strike

01:18.965 --> 01:21.300
within my own country.
Uh-oh! Somebody find Bolton.

01:21.301 --> 01:23.803
He looks like he should be
wearing a sleeping cap

01:23.804 --> 01:26.138
and blowing a feather in the air
every time he snores.

01:27.407 --> 01:30.141
Good evening, my fellow Americans.

01:30.142 --> 01:34.546
By the power vested in me, your
new national security advisor,

01:34.547 --> 01:37.849
I declare our country at war, again.

01:37.850 --> 01:40.151
"But who are we at war with?" you ask.

01:40.152 --> 01:43.988
Why box ourselves in
by declaring a single enemy?

01:43.989 --> 01:46.490
Imagine a world
where there is no world.

01:46.491 --> 01:49.094
The only mistake we made in Iraq

01:49.095 --> 01:51.896
is we went to war
for a made-up reason.

01:51.897 --> 01:53.598
When I take our country to war,

01:53.599 --> 01:56.434
I will provide no reason whatsoever!

01:56.435 --> 01:58.436
That's why I want to introduce

01:58.437 --> 02:02.506
my seven-point plan to
eradicate all seven continents.

02:02.507 --> 02:05.876
John... what are you doing?

02:05.877 --> 02:07.945
It's not a nuclear button, John.

02:07.946 --> 02:10.180
It's to get Lou Dobbs on
speakerphone.

02:10.181 --> 02:12.350
<i>Hello? Hello?
T-This is Dobbsie.</i>

02:12.351 --> 02:15.162
<b>1x10 - First Pitch</b>

02:15.197 --> 02:17.520
"DENT." "SERP."
I can read.

02:21.626 --> 02:24.194
<i>Because he's going bye-bye!</i>

02:24.195 --> 02:27.097
I'm very proud to present
H.R. McMaster,

02:27.098 --> 02:31.635
our National Security Advisor
or Secretary of Defense ... not sure ...

02:31.636 --> 02:33.936
with the National Defense Service Medal

02:33.937 --> 02:38.241
for bravery during combat in Iraq.
He'll be happy to know

02:38.242 --> 02:42.545
we'll be winning the Iraq War
for many, many years to come.

02:44.722 --> 02:47.023
Hey! I also served in Iraq!

02:47.024 --> 02:48.591
The media never talks about it.

02:48.592 --> 02:51.227
I ripped Saddam Hussein out
of that spider hole and said,

02:51.228 --> 02:52.594
"Knock it off, pinhead!"

02:52.595 --> 02:54.863
The soldiers voted me Best War Guy.

02:54.864 --> 02:56.765
I donated my medals to science

02:56.766 --> 03:00.202
so they could produce the next
generation of super soldiers.

03:00.203 --> 03:04.040
Anyway, here's your dumb medal!

03:06.209 --> 03:08.811
The reason I could suplex
Saddam out of that hole

03:08.812 --> 03:12.448
is I had so much upper-body
strength from my baseball days.

03:12.449 --> 03:15.317
The Yankees wanted me to play.
Actually, I played for the Yankees,

03:15.318 --> 03:17.085
and I would have been a Hall of Famer

03:17.086 --> 03:19.287
had I not left
to become a tricep model.

03:19.288 --> 03:22.324
Speaking of, Major League
Baseball's Washington Nationals

03:22.325 --> 03:24.625
have once again asked you
to throw out the first pitch.

03:24.626 --> 03:27.795
They promise to put security
between you and the Hispanic players.

03:27.796 --> 03:31.333
It's a tradition that all presidents
honor, so I assume you're a no?

03:31.334 --> 03:34.069
I'd love to, but, you know,
I might be so good

03:34.070 --> 03:37.072
that they make me play the whole game,
and I don't have time for that.

03:37.073 --> 03:39.841
Oh, promise me you'll watch
"Fox & Friends" in slow motion.

03:39.842 --> 03:43.344
- It's worth every hour.
- I'll happily throw the first pitch.

03:43.345 --> 03:47.582
Baseball is as American
as America before 1964.

03:47.583 --> 03:49.316
Or a middle-school textbook

03:49.317 --> 03:52.620
with a two-sentence paragraph
on the Trail of Tears.

03:52.621 --> 03:54.655
Or an abstinence-only class
full of pregnant teens.

03:54.656 --> 03:57.691
Just tell 'em tossing a ball
recalls a lonely childhood

03:57.692 --> 03:59.926
defined by an emotionally
distant father.

03:59.927 --> 04:01.661
Actually, just say my arm is sore.

04:03.465 --> 04:06.133
So, why don't you want to
throw the American baseball?

04:06.134 --> 04:08.268
<i>I can't rely on cameras 
to accurately capture</i>

04:08.269 --> 04:10.004
<i>how perfect the pitch will be.</i>

04:10.005 --> 04:11.271
<i>And if it doesn't look perfect,</i>

04:11.272 --> 04:13.640
<i>my manly image
will be put in jeopardy.</i>

04:13.641 --> 04:15.008
<i>Where did you put
my tanning cream?</i>

04:15.009 --> 04:16.510
It's under the sink!

04:16.511 --> 04:19.445
But you are the ultimate
example of masculinity!

04:19.446 --> 04:23.182
Why else would you shout,
"I am enough!" in your sleep every night?

04:23.183 --> 04:24.651
<i>Of course, I am.</i>

04:24.652 --> 04:26.653
<i>You know, any time I did
something remotely feminine,</i>

04:26.654 --> 04:28.622
<i>my father would dress me
like a stewardess</i>

04:28.623 --> 04:30.289
<i>and call me Diane for a year.</i>

04:30.290 --> 04:32.825
<i>But, hey, it worked!</i>

04:32.826 --> 04:35.561
So, this weekend,
are you thinking tennis,

04:35.562 --> 04:38.564
or should we have a Nancy Meyers
fest and just pig out?

04:41.168 --> 04:44.203
Mm-kay.
Read my bio back to me.

04:44.204 --> 04:47.006
"Ivanka Trump. Graduated from
the school her father went to,

04:47.007 --> 04:48.908
worked for the company
her father started,

04:48.909 --> 04:51.243
then worked for the
administration her father ran."

04:51.244 --> 04:55.681
I feel like my inspiring story of
self-reliance just isn't coming through.

04:55.682 --> 04:58.884
Maybe put back in that
I co-hosted my father's show.

04:58.885 --> 05:02.354
Honey, stop trying to frame
yourself as a female icon.

05:02.355 --> 05:04.222
You know, you just
don't have the same story

05:04.223 --> 05:06.558
as someone like Malala Yousafzai.

05:06.559 --> 05:08.693
Oh, my God, Jare-head.
Great idea.

05:08.694 --> 05:10.762
Take Malala's website biography.

05:10.763 --> 05:13.398
Search "Malala," replace with "Ivanka."

05:13.399 --> 05:16.601
Search "head scarf," replace with
"flirty summer dress."

05:16.602 --> 05:19.403
Search "violent attack,"
replace with "sex appeal."

05:19.404 --> 05:22.106
O-kay. Here we go...

05:22.107 --> 05:25.610
"Ivanka is currently enrolled
at the University of Oxford

05:25.611 --> 05:27.445
where she can be seen around campus

05:27.446 --> 05:31.549
- wearing her signature flirty summer dress.
- I go, girl!

05:31.550 --> 05:34.518
In 2012, a mass gunman
boarded Ivanka's school bus

05:34.519 --> 05:38.082
and asked for her by name
before waging a sex appeal."

05:39.090 --> 05:40.857
I think that all works.

05:41.158 --> 05:43.694
<i>Trump is such a poser!</i>

05:43.695 --> 05:45.762
I mean, the closest
he's gotten to combat

05:45.763 --> 05:48.399
is when he fought to not have
custody of his children!

05:48.400 --> 05:50.734
Hey! Are you guys
talking about me?

05:50.735 --> 05:53.203
Oh, you know, we're just
laughing about the fog of war.

05:53.204 --> 05:55.706
You guys think of me
as a guy's guy, right?

05:55.707 --> 05:57.574
Someone you fought in a foxhole with,

05:57.575 --> 06:00.276
fighting over who gets to eat
the fatty part of the fox?

06:00.277 --> 06:02.212
At the risk of being court-martialed,

06:02.213 --> 06:04.581
I'd like to remind you
that, quite famously,

06:04.582 --> 06:07.383
you got out of the war
by saying your feet hurt.

06:07.384 --> 06:09.953
I really wanted to go to war,
but if I did, the war would

06:09.954 --> 06:12.422
be over in like 12 hours.
Where's the fun in that?

06:12.423 --> 06:14.457
Well, that sort of
comes across as an excuse,

06:14.458 --> 06:16.593
and chickening out on the baseball thing

06:16.594 --> 06:20.296
might make people think twice
about your, uh... masculinity.

06:20.297 --> 06:23.166
Da-da-da-ba-da!
Don't bring chicken into this.

06:23.167 --> 06:26.135
They give up their life for this
country, and we need to honor them.

06:28.471 --> 06:32.241
If I'm going to compete with
fierce boss bitches like Malala,

06:32.242 --> 06:34.409
I need to follow her brand journey.

06:34.410 --> 06:36.646
Do you know her website
traffic went through the roof

06:36.647 --> 06:38.681
when she opened that school for girls?

06:38.682 --> 06:40.415
Same with Oh-prah.

06:40.416 --> 06:42.351
As Vogue's "vows that
make you go wow" documented,

06:42.352 --> 06:44.620
I love you so much,
but I am just not sure

06:44.621 --> 06:46.622
you will stick the landing on this.

06:46.623 --> 06:48.857
I mean, remember
the Ivanka Cruise Line?

06:48.858 --> 06:52.594
How was I supposed to know that
people would need water at sea?

06:52.595 --> 06:54.263
I don't know why I'm
getting in your way here.

06:54.264 --> 06:57.866
A-At least this act of total self-interest
might inadvertently help people.

06:57.867 --> 07:01.936
- And direct traffic to my website.
- Right, but mostly help people.

07:01.937 --> 07:06.207
Find my website and its hot deals.
Join a referral program today!

07:06.508 --> 07:09.711
<i>Uh, Mr. President,
have you reconsidered</i>

07:09.712 --> 07:11.546
throwing out the first pitch?

07:11.547 --> 07:14.282
Ehh. Seems sort of beneath
the office of the President.

07:14.283 --> 07:17.285
Now, get out! Some Disney Channel
kid made fun of me on Twitter.

07:17.286 --> 07:20.354
- How do you spell "fucktard"?
- I just wanted to let you know

07:20.355 --> 07:23.224
that this first-pitch thing,
it's not just about you.

07:23.225 --> 07:25.726
It's about all us heterosexual men.

07:25.727 --> 07:28.529
When the President guns that
ball into the catcher's mitt,

07:28.530 --> 07:31.331
it shows the nation that their
leading man is strong,

07:31.332 --> 07:33.667
that the patriarchy just makes sense.

07:33.668 --> 07:35.069
That men should decide

07:35.070 --> 07:37.805
which stores carry
feminine-hygiene products...

07:37.806 --> 07:40.540
and how deep into the desert
those stores should be located.

07:40.541 --> 07:43.510
No one embraces this office's
masculinity more than the guy

07:43.511 --> 07:45.245
who permanently shamed
a woman to get it.

07:45.246 --> 07:47.547
And you're overstating
this first-pitch thing.

07:47.548 --> 07:49.716
- Ronald Reagan never did it.
- Yes, he did.

07:49.717 --> 07:53.019
All the Presidents did.
Even Jimmy Carter.

07:53.020 --> 07:57.557
- Three times.
- No! Not puny President Peanut Farmer!

07:57.558 --> 07:59.892
You tell the
Washington Nationals' catcher

07:59.893 --> 08:02.895
to wear longer shoes or whatever
those goofy bastards wear

08:02.896 --> 08:05.331
because I'm gonna throw
the manliest first pitch

08:05.332 --> 08:07.600
in Presidential history!

08:12.539 --> 08:13.572
<i> "Hannity"!</i>

08:13.573 --> 08:16.542
<i>Good to be back, patriots.
I spent a long weekend</i>

08:16.543 --> 08:18.745
<i>chasing Meryl Streep
with a riding lawn mower.</i>

08:18.746 --> 08:21.547
<i>President Trump's first pitch
is one week away,</i>

08:21.548 --> 08:23.749
<i>and you can bet
I'll be in the bleachers</i>

08:23.750 --> 08:26.885
<i>making the game unbearable
for anybody around me!</i>

08:26.886 --> 08:30.522
All right, sir. General Mattis
is 60 feet, 6 inches away.

08:30.523 --> 08:32.758
Just like the catcher when
you throw your first pitch.

08:32.759 --> 08:35.527
Ohh!
My bones are spurring!

08:35.528 --> 08:36.895
Oww!

08:36.895 --> 08:39.631
- We don't have time to watch you stall.
- Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

08:39.631 --> 08:43.101
You know how many e-mails you get
when you're running three goddamn wars?

08:43.102 --> 08:45.403
Okay, I did it.
It was so fast, you couldn't see it.

08:45.404 --> 08:48.874
We can see the ball in your hand, sir.
It's covered with yellow icing.

08:48.875 --> 08:50.708
Where the hell
did you get yellow icing?!

08:50.709 --> 08:52.244
Well, it's none of your business

08:52.245 --> 08:54.044
which child's party I stole cake from.

08:54.045 --> 08:57.915
Here we go, Mattis.
Have the hand repair man standing by.

08:57.916 --> 08:59.817
Yah!

08:59.818 --> 09:02.720
The ball freaked out at the
last second, dove for cover,

09:02.721 --> 09:05.657
and I'm more masculine
than you even realized!

09:06.258 --> 09:08.459
W-Why are you guys staring at me?

09:08.460 --> 09:10.460
Is it my hair?
Do I have a whitehead?!

09:10.561 --> 09:12.963
I'm pretty sure, to open a school,

09:12.964 --> 09:15.565
you just rent out
two floors of a brownstone,

09:15.566 --> 09:18.269
get a tobacco company
to donate a bunch of iPads,

09:18.270 --> 09:21.638
and choose which Pinot grigio best
complements the multiplication tables.

09:21.639 --> 09:24.641
It's actually far less
complicated than that!

09:24.642 --> 09:27.177
My administration has worked tirelessly

09:27.178 --> 09:29.780
to accept schools
of all different types.

09:29.781 --> 09:33.917
Some schools have libraries,
study lounges, and iPads galore.

09:33.918 --> 09:36.019
Others have... roofs.

09:36.020 --> 09:38.689
I just want to make it easier
for even one young woman

09:38.690 --> 09:40.424
to grow up and be the next

09:40.425 --> 09:44.527
IvankaTrump.com unique visitor
and newsletter subscriber.

09:44.528 --> 09:48.531
I just don't want
them to struggle like me!

09:48.532 --> 09:51.536
Like and share if you agree!

09:52.837 --> 09:57.006
Enh! Ahhh!
So, Don, you wanna get in on the old

09:57.007 --> 10:00.676
"overcompensate for
feelings of inferiority" game

10:00.677 --> 10:03.679
and strut for the man
with a Texas-sized pistola?

10:03.680 --> 10:05.280
I figure if anyone knows guns,

10:05.281 --> 10:08.150
it's the guy Secret Service
refuses to protect.

10:08.151 --> 10:09.552
That's Ted Cruz!!

10:09.553 --> 10:12.555
Here's one rifle for you
and one for me!

10:12.556 --> 10:14.824
Whoa! Wow!
I really do feel like a man!

10:14.825 --> 10:16.825
That means it's workin'!

10:16.826 --> 10:19.862
Now, I'm gonna reveal a couple
embarrassing details about myself.

10:19.863 --> 10:24.066
And watch as I still feel good
because I'm holding a gun!

10:24.067 --> 10:25.868
I once kidnapped my neighbor's cat

10:25.869 --> 10:29.071
so I could use it to practice kissing!
Feelin' good!

10:29.072 --> 10:31.974
One time, I dropped my drawers,
and my date ran out the room

10:31.975 --> 10:34.509
like she was trying to
outrun a nine-foot centipede!

10:34.510 --> 10:36.043
Feelin' good!

10:36.044 --> 10:39.313
- Now you do one.
- Umm...

10:39.314 --> 10:44.652
- I hung out with Ted Cruz?
- Feelin' good!

10:48.123 --> 10:51.492
Thank you for meeting with me
about my new school.

10:51.493 --> 10:55.046
It's just nice to talk to someone
who I share so much

10:55.047 --> 10:58.032
- life experience with.
- Absolutely.

10:58.033 --> 11:01.936
And I'm just so excited that the
meritocracy is working properly,

11:01.937 --> 11:05.106
and you're serving in the
most powerful office on Earth.

11:05.107 --> 11:07.875
I know you're not feeling well
and need to get back

11:07.876 --> 11:10.577
to making sure your brain
doesn't spill out of your head,

11:10.578 --> 11:11.879
and so I'll get to it.

11:11.880 --> 11:14.448
I would love to accept
a sizable contribution

11:14.449 --> 11:16.784
from The Clinton Foundation
for my new school.

11:16.785 --> 11:19.219
Oh, we're not really
a foundation anymore,

11:19.220 --> 11:21.955
so much as a thick smoke
screen for Republicans

11:21.956 --> 11:24.690
to draw attention from your
father's Mussolini cosplay.

11:24.691 --> 11:27.360
And you're doing a great job!

11:27.361 --> 11:29.796
So, from one feminist to another,

11:29.797 --> 11:34.534
- can we agree to lift each other up?
- I'd love to, but unfortunately,

11:34.535 --> 11:36.803
I'm on so much Xanax and chardonnay

11:36.804 --> 11:38.971
that I'm not legally allowed
to write a check.

11:38.972 --> 11:40.406
I'll tell you what, though.

11:40.407 --> 11:43.309
Until that changes,
you can eat my ass.

11:46.112 --> 11:47.480
<i>Let's make this quick.</i>

11:47.481 --> 11:49.782
I get Don Jr. to teach me
to smoke cigarettes ...

11:49.783 --> 11:52.384
Thank God you're here, sir!
North Korean Leader Kim Jong-un

11:52.385 --> 11:54.119
has just test-fired a nuclear warhead

11:54.120 --> 11:56.422
with enough range to hit
the continental United States!

11:56.423 --> 12:01.393
Sir, this is deadly serious.
The nation is counting on you.

12:01.394 --> 12:03.162
W-Wait. R-Really?

12:03.163 --> 12:06.798
You're gonna let me finally do this?
I'd think I was dreaming,

12:06.799 --> 12:08.934
but none of you are cougars
trying to eat my penis.

12:08.935 --> 12:11.837
Sir, we can't tell you what to do.

12:11.838 --> 12:16.627
You have to decide if you're man
enough to hit that button.

12:16.662 --> 12:18.329
<i>♪ Oh-ohh ♪</i>

12:18.364 --> 12:20.679
You know, I've always talked
a big game about this,

12:20.680 --> 12:22.747
but now that the moment is here,

12:22.748 --> 12:25.684
I'm just not sure if I want
to press the button.

12:25.685 --> 12:27.986
Or really press the button!

12:27.987 --> 12:30.421
- Aaaaah! Grr! Aaah!
- Sir! Sir!

12:30.422 --> 12:32.690
- Hello?! Sir!
- Ah-ha-ha!

12:32.691 --> 12:35.093
That button isn't
attached to anything.

12:35.094 --> 12:36.660
We just wanted you to feel like a man

12:36.661 --> 12:39.163
so you'd drop this whole
"bound to be humiliating"

12:39.164 --> 12:41.867
- first-pitch idea.
- Drop it?

12:41.902 --> 12:45.703
You just gave me the confidence I
needed to want to do it even more!

12:45.704 --> 12:49.507
I'm a big bad button boy now,
and nothing can stop me!

12:49.508 --> 12:53.110
- By the way, have you practiced at all?
- Real cool, McMasters.

12:53.111 --> 12:55.880
Those cake eaters might still be
having a birthday party.

12:55.881 --> 12:58.282
You gonna go stab their bouncy castle?

12:59.183 --> 12:59.984
Boop!

13:02.223 --> 13:03.623
<i>"Hannity"!</i>

13:03.624 --> 13:05.325

13:07.861 --> 13:10.029
<i>President Donald JFK Trump.</i>

13:10.030 --> 13:12.031
<i>Great to be here, hoss.</i>

13:12.032 --> 13:13.833
<i>You're here to promote
your first pitch,</i>

13:13.834 --> 13:15.968
<i>and who am I to get in the way of
what the government wants to do?</i>

13:15.969 --> 13:19.338
<i>And the first 10,000 fans will receive...</i>

13:19.339 --> 13:21.407
<i>Buff President Man Beans!</i>

13:21.408 --> 13:23.409
<i>These Man Beans
are an intense cocktail</i>

13:23.410 --> 13:26.145
<i>of fresh legumes
and grounded hammers</i>

13:26.146 --> 13:28.981
<i>sprinkled with bull-penis

13:28.982 --> 13:30.683
<i>Any more of this manlihood,</i>

13:30.684 --> 13:33.252
<i>and I tell you, my penis will jump
out of my pants and go bowling.</i>

13:33.253 --> 13:35.688
<i>So let's bring in someone
who can speak for all women ...</i>

13:35.689 --> 13:38.390
<i>hot, blond rich lady Ivanka Trump.</i>

13:38.391 --> 13:40.992
<i>Everyone knows there's
no greater ally for women</i>

13:40.993 --> 13:42.361
<i>than Sean Hannity.</i>

13:42.362 --> 13:44.029
<i>I have to.
They're helpless.</i>

13:44.030 --> 13:46.699
<i>That's why I chose this platform
to announce</i>

13:46.700 --> 13:51.002
<i>the Ivanka Trump School for
Women and Girls in Africa.</i>

13:51.003 --> 13:54.272
<i>We'll give these amazing
women and girls in Africa</i>

13:54.273 --> 13:57.943
<i>the skills they need to succeed
in the new economy in Africa.</i>

13:57.944 --> 14:00.578
<i>Wow. Isn't she great, Don?
Unbelievable.</i>

14:00.579 --> 14:02.748
<i>She's almost as good as the worst man.</i>

14:02.749 --> 14:05.516
<i>She's nipping
at Mark Ruffalo's heels!</i>

14:07.019 --> 14:10.187
<i>Sir, you never finished
telling us whether</i>

14:10.188 --> 14:13.558
you want to be vacuum-sealed
so you won't get the sniffles.

14:13.559 --> 14:15.926
- Enhh!
- What does that mean?

14:15.927 --> 14:17.595
Everyone knows Donald Trump

14:17.596 --> 14:21.599
is the strong, silent type
who keeps his thoughts to himself

14:21.600 --> 14:25.602
and stares into fireplaces,
searching for answers.

14:25.603 --> 14:29.640
Sir, you've replaced all the
fireplaces with 95-inch flat screens.

14:29.641 --> 14:31.275
Seems like the modern world

14:31.276 --> 14:34.411
has got no place for this
old callous tumbleweed.

14:34.412 --> 14:36.580
Now, if you'll kindly step aside,

14:36.581 --> 14:41.318
I'll be on my motorcycle to
wherever the man wind takes me.

14:41.319 --> 14:44.288
<i>You're watching "The Price is Right"!</i>

14:44.289 --> 14:48.292
<i>Oh, my God!
What is Drew Carey wearing?!</i>

14:49.727 --> 14:51.928
Jare-head, the segment's on!

14:51.929 --> 14:54.264
Stop sitting fully clothed
on the toilet

14:54.265 --> 14:56.633
with your head in your hands
while the shower's running!

14:56.634 --> 14:58.301
Sorry. I was ...
I was just trying to enjoy

14:58.302 --> 15:00.270
sitting on a toilet without
a cellmate leering at me.

15:00.271 --> 15:03.006
<i>Okay, we have here the details
of Ivanka Trump's school.</i>

15:03.007 --> 15:04.774
<i>Tell me if this sounds... familiar.</i>

15:04.775 --> 15:07.310
<i>A group of young women sitting in rows.</i>

15:07.311 --> 15:09.179
Women are stronger together.

15:09.180 --> 15:11.681
<i>The women are making clothes.</i>

15:11.682 --> 15:15.284
<i>- Such a valuable skill.
- For pennies.</i>

15:15.285 --> 15:18.854
<i>Then the clothes are sold for
thousands on IvankaTrump.com.</i>

15:18.855 --> 15:20.790
That way, I make a big profit!

15:20.791 --> 15:22.257
<i>This, my friends, is billed</i>

15:22.258 --> 15:25.194
<i>as, oohr, an institution
of female empowerment</i>

15:25.195 --> 15:28.163
<i>but is actually a sweatshop.</i>

15:28.164 --> 15:30.432
You know, that wasn't my intent,

15:30.433 --> 15:33.135
but it's definitely where I ended up.

15:33.636 --> 15:37.039
<i>Did you see Rupert Murdoch
in Vanity Fair?</i>

15:37.040 --> 15:39.541
He found four women
willing to marry him,

15:39.542 --> 15:41.944
but he couldn't find
a decent chin implant?

15:41.945 --> 15:44.213
I had a Rupert in my platoon.

15:44.214 --> 15:48.383
Used to tell him stories about
my pregnant wife, Lucy, back home.

15:50.052 --> 15:52.954
Since when do you care about
the Battle of the Bulge?

15:52.955 --> 15:56.023
Gladiators, Melania.
Every one of them.

15:56.024 --> 15:59.661
That's when men were men
and battles were of the bulge.

15:59.662 --> 16:03.130
Are you ever going to
practice throwing a baseball?!

16:03.131 --> 16:06.500
Can I get one moment of peace
in my own damn house?

16:06.501 --> 16:08.903
If you need me, I'll be at the tavern,

16:08.904 --> 16:12.639
drinking whiskey and
humming old Irish hymns.

16:12.640 --> 16:15.676
<i>Welcome back to "Wheel of Fortune"!</i>

16:15.677 --> 16:18.179
<i>Oh, my God!
Is that a new wheel?!</i>

16:20.825 --> 16:22.425
<i>Everyone's come out against me.</i>

16:22.426 --> 16:24.361
Oh-prah, Ellen,

16:24.362 --> 16:26.630
the United Nations Commission
on Human Rights,

16:26.631 --> 16:28.465
The Barefoot Contessa!

16:28.466 --> 16:31.001
Come on, babe. You had to
know this was coming.

16:31.002 --> 16:32.435
I mean, you don't see a lot of schools

16:32.436 --> 16:34.471
with an electrified perimeter fence.

16:34.472 --> 16:36.339
These countries are dangerous,

16:36.340 --> 16:38.641
and I didn't want
my students getting away!

16:38.642 --> 16:40.143
The real victims here

16:40.144 --> 16:42.712
are the price-conscious customers of
IvankaTrump.com.

16:42.713 --> 16:45.281
Ooh. Bad news, babe.

16:45.282 --> 16:48.118
"This website has been suspended

16:48.119 --> 16:53.055
due to a violation of our
policy against child slavery"?!

16:53.056 --> 16:56.893
N-o-o-o-o-o!

16:59.209 --> 17:01.744
Hey.
Where's my man costume?

17:01.745 --> 17:04.946
I can't find my cowboy hat and
Tim Allen keychain anywhere.

17:04.948 --> 17:06.616
We threw them in the trash.

17:06.617 --> 17:09.919
We were sick of your sweet-ass
manly attitude which fucking rules!

17:09.920 --> 17:13.255
But we hated it!
You made me go Alaskan crab fishing.

17:13.256 --> 17:15.624
A wave clocked me,
and I barfed on my ass!

17:15.625 --> 17:18.693
Oh, and one more thing.
We canceled your first pitch.

17:18.694 --> 17:20.462
What?!
Why would you do that?!

17:20.463 --> 17:22.531
They can't start the game
without the first pitch.

17:22.531 --> 17:25.233
That's like starting the day
without a failed bowel movement.

17:25.234 --> 17:28.036
They found another
septuagenarian to replace you.

17:28.037 --> 17:31.239
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
our darkest fears have been realized.</i>

17:31.240 --> 17:33.408
<i>The first pitch to open the season</i>

17:33.409 --> 17:35.276
<i>for the Washington Nationals
will be thrown out</i>

17:35.277 --> 17:37.746
<i>by career criminal Hillary Clinton.</i>

17:37.747 --> 17:40.381
<i>The attack on Pearl Harbor
now seems like</i>

17:40.382 --> 17:42.250
<i>Free Cone Day at Ben & Jerry's.</i>

17:42.251 --> 17:47.255
Torch one of my TVs.
I need a fire to stare into.

17:53.128 --> 17:55.063
I wouldn't have bought this television

17:55.064 --> 17:57.065
if I knew it'd smell weird
when I burned it.

17:57.066 --> 17:59.567
<i>Fox News alert.
North Korean Leader Kim Jong-un</i>

17:59.568 --> 18:01.268
<i>has just released a video</i>

<i>reportedly showing him throwing

18:05.106 --> 18:06.340
<i>Oh!</i>

18:06.341 --> 18:10.110
<i>Afterwards, the North
Korean dictator had this to say.</i>

18:10.111 --> 18:11.512
<i>"My rocket fastball</i>

<i>a den of tasteless reptilian erotica."</i>

18:26.160 --> 18:30.998
I specifically said do not make
Eric head of your cybersecurity team.

18:31.299 --> 18:33.466
God damn it!

18:33.467 --> 18:36.435
I flew that chopper full of
dangling ladies out of Saigon,

18:36.436 --> 18:38.671
and this is the parade
they throw me?!

18:38.672 --> 18:42.008
Sir, we need to talk.
You did not fight in Vietnam.

18:42.009 --> 18:43.810
You said you had bone spurs,

18:43.811 --> 18:46.012
which is an insult to
the brave draft dodgers

18:46.013 --> 18:48.814
who struggled to at least
come up with a good excuse.

18:48.815 --> 18:52.284
Mr. President, I'm gonna tell
you something you need to hear.

18:52.285 --> 18:55.888
- You aren't a man's man.
- Stop throwing shade, you bitch.

18:55.889 --> 18:57.623
That's what I mean.

18:57.624 --> 19:00.659
You care about gossip,
wear tons of makeup,

19:00.660 --> 19:04.296
and use a truck's worth of hair spray
just to show up for breakfast.

19:04.297 --> 19:07.132
You're one notch away
from being a nosy landlady

19:07.133 --> 19:12.137
- or a judge on "Project Runway."
- Can we talk about Tim Gunn?

19:12.138 --> 19:16.374
- I'm doing it right now, aren't I?
- And that's okay.

19:16.375 --> 19:20.512
This whole John Wayne,
Clint Eastwood thing is in the past.

19:20.513 --> 19:23.014
Now women want to be
paid the same as men,

19:23.015 --> 19:25.517
and men want to be paid
to write travel blogs,

19:25.518 --> 19:28.386
and as much as we resist,
this movement won't stop

19:28.387 --> 19:32.190
until every person has an
amorphous, genderless genital.

19:32.191 --> 19:34.426
If the diva's done with her spotlight,

19:34.427 --> 19:36.494
can we get back to me
and the first pitch?

19:36.495 --> 19:38.362
- Should I go for it?
- Why not?

19:38.363 --> 19:40.064
Just because you're
not a man's man

19:40.065 --> 19:43.067
doesn't mean you shouldn't
continue to pretend to be one.

19:43.068 --> 19:45.937
That's still who this country elected.

19:45.938 --> 19:47.905
Don't forget someone
who favored white people.

19:47.906 --> 19:49.206
Sure, sure.
That's a given.

19:49.207 --> 19:50.841
How did this happen?

19:50.842 --> 19:52.843
I think I need to talk
to the person in the world

19:52.844 --> 19:55.845
who inspires me most.

19:55.846 --> 19:59.583
Hey, Ivanka.
It's me, Ivanka Trump.

19:59.584 --> 20:01.585
What should I do?

20:01.586 --> 20:04.521
Open a school for women
and girls in Africa?

20:04.522 --> 20:06.290
OMG! Great idea, queen!

20:06.291 --> 20:09.293
I can see where this is headed.
You can buy tons of schools.

20:09.294 --> 20:11.227
I can buy tons of
overleveraged properties.

20:11.228 --> 20:13.597
None of it will make a difference.

20:13.598 --> 20:15.899
We'll just never have the
inspiring life experiences

20:15.900 --> 20:19.235
of Oprah or Malala
or pretty much anyone who grew up

20:19.236 --> 20:21.071
without a live-in eyebrow threader.

20:21.072 --> 20:23.239
What do you mean?
I've struggled.

20:23.240 --> 20:25.575
One time, my horse,
Benedict Chambray, was sick,

20:25.576 --> 20:27.543
so I had to take
horseback riding lessons

20:27.544 --> 20:30.246
on one that I had zero rapport with!

20:30.247 --> 20:33.916
Yeah, but Malala and Oprah
have been through some shit!

20:33.917 --> 20:35.818
You can't just hashtag your way

20:35.819 --> 20:37.886
to becoming a respected female icon.

20:37.887 --> 20:41.390
You actually have to
overcome adversity.

20:41.391 --> 20:43.326
<i>We go live now to Hillary Clinton,</i>

20:43.327 --> 20:45.794
<i>who is holding an impromptu
press conference.</i>

20:45.795 --> 20:48.063
<i>As many of you know, earlier today,</i>

20:48.064 --> 20:51.433
<i>I suffered a little heat stroke.
It was very hot outside,</i>

20:51.434 --> 20:55.504
<i>and I didn't drink enough water
this morning.</i>

20:55.505 --> 20:59.341
<i>Anyways, I'm feeling great,
and I look forward</i>

20:59.342 --> 21:03.311
<i>to continuing to fight for
the American people. Whee!</i>

21:03.312 --> 21:06.481
Holy crap!
I can still do the first pitch?!

21:06.482 --> 21:08.416
Oh, and remind me to ask Hillary

21:08.417 --> 21:10.452
what lotion she uses for her face.

21:10.453 --> 21:13.087
I'm pretty sure it's La Mer,
but it could be Lancóme.

21:13.088 --> 21:15.257
There's my guy.

21:15.258 --> 21:17.792
<i>Welcome to the opening game</i>

21:17.793 --> 21:21.328
<i>of the 2018 Major League
Baseball season!</i>

21:21.329 --> 21:25.332
<i>Tonight's game is brought to you
by Buff President Man Beans!</i>

21:25.333 --> 21:28.850
<i>I gots to have my Man Beans.</i>

21:28.871 --> 21:32.040
Boo! The national anthem
was too short!

21:32.041 --> 21:36.210
Sing all the verses! I'm hungry!
Hey, hot-dog guy!

21:36.211 --> 21:39.280
Hot-dog guy!
Hot-dog guy! Hot dog!

21:39.281 --> 21:40.648
<i> Tonight's first pitch</i>

21:40.649 --> 21:44.718
<i>will be thrown by your president,
Donald J. Trump!</i>

21:47.189 --> 21:50.824
Come on, Donald.
It all comes down to this.

21:50.825 --> 21:53.860
You've been saving your arm
for this moment for 71 years.

21:53.861 --> 21:55.495
Everybody shut up!

21:55.496 --> 21:58.231
Stars and stripes are
about to shoot out his ass!

21:58.232 --> 22:02.703
Okay. Here we go.
On your marks, get set...

22:02.704 --> 22:06.039
Halt, Daddy!
I won't let you throw that pitch!

22:06.040 --> 22:08.174
You're not Ivanka Strong!

22:08.175 --> 22:11.344
What are you doing here, Ivanka?
Daddy's working.

22:11.345 --> 22:14.180
I'm queen of The Resistance now.

22:14.181 --> 22:17.717
No more first pitches until
there's a female president!

22:17.718 --> 22:20.653
And that female president is me!

22:23.389 --> 22:25.725
Don't waste those beans!!

22:25.726 --> 22:29.195
Pour 'em into your hands
and jam 'em down my throat!

22:29.196 --> 22:32.998
They're booing me.
I'm facing adversity!

22:32.999 --> 22:36.535
I hear your voices, and you are heard!

22:36.536 --> 22:38.537
You're so brave, honey.

22:38.538 --> 22:40.839
And what kind of veteran would I be

22:40.840 --> 22:44.943
if I didn't support you 100%?
Baseball's canceled!

22:44.944 --> 22:47.546
I'm not longer in it.
Ratings are terrible.

22:47.547 --> 22:49.848
<i>Your beans taste like shit.</i>

22:49.849 --> 22:52.884
<i>Security removed
a vomiting Sean Hannity</i>

22:52.885 --> 22:56.554
<i>after he overindulged on Man Beans.</i>

22:56.555 --> 22:58.056
<i>Then Ivanka Trump announced</i>

22:58.057 --> 23:00.759
<i>that she'll be
the first female president.</i>

23:00.760 --> 23:04.562
Oh, my God! Why is everyone
pressuring me to be president?

23:04.563 --> 23:06.430
That's bullshit, Ivanka!

23:06.431 --> 23:08.432
I'm the oldest, so I should
be the next president!

23:08.433 --> 23:11.035
And my VP will be my boy Nick.

23:11.036 --> 23:14.305
Dude's twitchy as hell, and he
knows all the state capitals.

23:14.306 --> 23:17.575
Can I be president if I have
a cinnamon allergy?

23:17.576 --> 23:20.278
Ooh, I could make this all
come crashing down.

23:20.279 --> 23:21.646
Is anyone going to
first ask their wives

23:21.647 --> 23:23.247
before running for president?

23:23.248 --> 23:24.415
- Boo!
- Boo!

23:24.416 --> 23:25.983
Bring back Mal ...
Marna or whatever.

23:25.984 --> 23:28.218
You'll all get your turn
to be president.

23:28.219 --> 23:30.888
Just promise that you'll
pardon the rest of us.

23:30.889 --> 23:32.489
- Sounds good.
- I love you, Daddy!

23:32.490 --> 23:34.892
Now I must do what the
people elected me to do.

23:34.893 --> 23:37.560
Bully Hillary Clinton
on all media platforms?

23:37.561 --> 23:39.296
Show America that Eric's a dipshit?

23:39.297 --> 23:42.065
Dad! Don's making fun of me!

23:42.066 --> 23:45.435
Yes to all of that!
But, more importantly,

23:45.436 --> 23:48.605
watch television until it's another day.

23:48.606 --> 23:51.974
