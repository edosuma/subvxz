Who?

10:35.335 --> 10:37.068
I had the daily
double.

10:37.070 --> 10:38.903
I had the daily
double.

10:38.905 --> 10:40.905
I got a bad leg.

10:40.907 --> 10:43.041
Why don't you
take this $20

10:43.043 --> 10:45.076
and go bet
the 6 horse for me?

10:45.078 --> 10:47.779
Bring me back
the tickets, honey.

10:53.285 --> 10:54.919
It's a living.

10:56.355 --> 10:58.723
This is your half.

10:58.725 --> 10:59.758
For me?

10:59.760 --> 11:00.925
Goes under your tongue.

11:00.927 --> 11:02.227
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:02.229 --> 11:05.263
Let's go
across the street,
get a beer.

11:07.667 --> 11:10.802
I don't know.
I feel different today.

11:10.804 --> 11:13.171
Today is
not like yesterday.

11:13.173 --> 11:16.675
Well, yesterday was hot.
Today is very hot.

11:18.944 --> 11:21.946
Hey, how about
a beer and two aspirins?

11:21.948 --> 11:23.281
And two Maalox.

11:25.818 --> 11:27.085
Hello, Vibes.

11:33.092 --> 11:34.959
I think he's dead.

11:34.961 --> 11:37.095
Hey. Hey, Looney,
here it is.

11:37.097 --> 11:38.363
Charity,
the four horse.

11:38.365 --> 11:40.365
It might be
a late scratch.

11:40.367 --> 11:42.367
40-to-1 odds
on the morning line.

11:42.369 --> 11:44.202
They'll bet that down.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.403
I like the Packers.

11:45.405 --> 11:47.072
Those guys
weren't kidding.

11:47.074 --> 11:48.707
He's lost
all meeting.

11:48.709 --> 11:51.276
Listen--"not
in this lifetime."

11:51.278 --> 11:53.144
Hmm? Perfect.

11:53.146 --> 11:56.247
I might bet half
on the Packers.

11:56.249 --> 11:58.783
I may not lose
too bad.

11:58.785 --> 12:00.952
Maybe you'll
get a discount
for coming close.

12:00.954 --> 12:02.320
I'm calling Lufkin.

12:02.322 --> 12:05.190
Trotter, you know about
my 32-star system, right?

12:05.192 --> 12:06.858
Mm-hmm.

12:06.860 --> 12:10.862
Well, I haven't
put up a 40-star
system in years.

12:10.864 --> 12:14.032
First race,
blurred image is it.

12:14.034 --> 12:15.834
Blurred image.

12:15.836 --> 12:17.402
This is a name
that trips off
your tongue.

12:17.404 --> 12:18.770
Give me blurred
image's number.

12:18.772 --> 12:20.071
7.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.272
No way on Earth.

12:21.274 --> 12:23.475
Bullshit,
no way on Earth.

12:23.477 --> 12:25.176
Bet an
American horse

12:25.178 --> 12:27.512
with a foreign
jockey up, there's--

12:27.514 --> 12:29.748
8 is the one.

12:29.750 --> 12:31.516
There's
a $2 minimum bet.

12:31.518 --> 12:33.151
Lo Fat?

12:33.153 --> 12:34.385
Horse stinks,

12:34.387 --> 12:36.788
but I'm
betting on him.

12:36.790 --> 12:37.956
150 what?

12:37.958 --> 12:39.791
The number is the key.

12:39.793 --> 12:41.059
The odds?

12:41.061 --> 12:42.260
I got the number.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.295
I thought
you were dead.

12:44.297 --> 12:45.897
I was getting
the number.

12:45.899 --> 12:47.966
Listen, the number's 8.

12:47.968 --> 12:50.535
First I clear
my mind of everything.

12:50.537 --> 12:52.070
That shouldn't
take long.

12:52.072 --> 12:53.872
Oh, look at that.
It couldn't
be worse.

12:53.874 --> 12:55.840
Looney, please.
Pay attention.

12:55.842 --> 12:57.542
Just relax.

13:00.212 --> 13:02.247
Don't even think
of women.

13:02.249 --> 13:03.548
Two jugs pop up,

13:03.550 --> 13:07.152
it'll take 17 minutes
to get rid of them.

13:13.492 --> 13:16.060
A number's
going to flash--

13:16.062 --> 13:18.396
4, 6, 9--

13:18.398 --> 13:20.098
It'll be moving fast.

13:20.100 --> 13:21.299
You got to keep
your eyes open.

13:21.301 --> 13:24.869
In sports with teams,
letters appear.

13:24.871 --> 13:26.104
I see a "D."

13:26.106 --> 13:28.306
That could be
Dallas, Denver.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.241
Oh, God.

13:30.243 --> 13:32.243
Trotter,
what's the matter?

13:32.245 --> 13:35.513
I just saw my life
flash before me.

13:35.515 --> 13:37.015
What'd it
look like?

13:37.017 --> 13:39.551
It was going
down the drain.

13:39.553 --> 13:45.223
You just had a vibe
on the 5 horse,
sink or swim.

13:45.225 --> 13:46.925
Your life's going
down the drain?

13:46.927 --> 13:48.860
Sink...drain...

13:48.862 --> 13:50.161
you get this
connection?

13:50.163 --> 13:51.563
Oh, God.

13:51.565 --> 13:53.164
That's incredible!

13:53.166 --> 13:56.601
Hey, I'm trying
to educate you guys.

13:59.238 --> 14:01.139
2 horse
in the second race

14:01.141 --> 14:03.441
is a mortal lock, and
I'm going to wheel him.

14:03.443 --> 14:06.344
Boys, meet Evangeline.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.246
Evangeline,
meet the boys.

14:08.248 --> 14:10.849
Looney, Vibes, Marty...

14:10.851 --> 14:12.617
Where's Trotter?

14:15.387 --> 14:18.289
I don't believe
I'm with these losers.

14:20.159 --> 14:21.559
You know that.

14:23.362 --> 14:26.364
I belong over
in the jockey club,

14:26.366 --> 14:29.968
talking to guys
with all their teeth.

14:29.970 --> 14:32.070
Aw, look, I--

14:32.072 --> 14:35.306
I know you're trying
to give me a break.

14:37.476 --> 14:39.978
Just let me win
this one.

14:39.980 --> 14:43.314
Just let me win
this one last one.

14:43.316 --> 14:45.950
Then I can make
everything up to Pam.

14:45.952 --> 14:47.252
I'll be out
of the hole

14:47.254 --> 14:49.487
and on my way, OK?

14:49.489 --> 14:52.457
I will. I swear.
I'm due.

14:52.459 --> 14:53.925
[toilet flushes]

14:53.927 --> 14:55.994
Yeah, so's Jesus.

14:55.996 --> 14:57.395
There's no soap
here.

14:57.397 --> 14:58.496
No shit.

14:58.498 --> 15:00.031
Let it ride.

15:00.033 --> 15:01.332
Let it ride?

15:01.334 --> 15:03.268
I hate this place.

15:03.270 --> 15:04.903
Got some I.D.,
miss?

15:04.905 --> 15:06.905
Oh, sure.

15:11.677 --> 15:13.511
She's 19.

15:13.513 --> 15:15.380
I got a dog 19.

15:16.649 --> 15:18.049
Sid?

15:18.051 --> 15:20.318
Who's her orthodontist,
Ray Charles?

15:21.654 --> 15:22.654
Sidney?

15:22.656 --> 15:23.655
Oh.

15:23.657 --> 15:24.656
Don't...

15:24.658 --> 15:25.990
Let me.

15:25.992 --> 15:27.592
Watch my teeth.

15:27.594 --> 15:29.560
Let me.
I think I got it.

15:29.562 --> 15:30.628
There you go.

15:30.630 --> 15:32.030
That better?

15:35.935 --> 15:38.069

16:04.297 --> 16:06.097
Hi, Evangeline.

16:06.099 --> 16:07.966
Hi. It's my first
time at the track.

16:07.968 --> 16:08.967
Trotter.

16:08.969 --> 16:10.101
Over here.

16:10.103 --> 16:11.970
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Pardon me.

16:11.972 --> 16:13.404
There you go.
Pardon me.

16:13.406 --> 16:14.405
Trotter.

16:14.407 --> 16:15.406
Sidney.

16:15.408 --> 16:16.741
Look. The 5 horse.

16:16.743 --> 16:18.309
Looks like
it's asleep.

16:18.311 --> 16:21.980
You take a horse
with a large ass

16:21.982 --> 16:23.314
and you got
a winner.

16:23.316 --> 16:24.716
Who do you like?

16:24.718 --> 16:26.384
He likes
the 4 horse.

16:26.386 --> 16:28.353
Thanks for shooting
your mouth off.

16:28.355 --> 16:30.588
The 4 horse?
It's got leprosy.

16:30.590 --> 16:32.190
The coat's
a little rough.

16:32.192 --> 16:33.391
Don't talk to people.

16:33.393 --> 16:35.159
This is a horse race.

16:35.161 --> 16:36.494
This isn't the Olympics.

16:36.496 --> 16:37.996
I like Charity, too.

16:37.998 --> 16:40.365
He's got
a cute nose.

16:40.367 --> 16:42.533
The 5 horse
is a mortal lock.

16:42.535 --> 16:45.103
You can play a tune
on the 3 horse's ribs.

16:45.105 --> 16:47.271
They're so pretty.

16:47.273 --> 16:49.240
Charity's conscious.

16:56.081 --> 16:58.249
Look, there they are!
Those two guys--

16:58.251 --> 17:00.385
Keep your
voice down, please.

17:05.391 --> 17:07.724
This is in the bag.

17:10.362 --> 17:12.730
Last-minute strategy.

17:12.732 --> 17:14.332
He's probably
telling him

17:14.334 --> 17:16.334
to go wide
on the first turn.

17:20.105 --> 17:22.205
"Go fast and win."

17:23.642 --> 17:25.209
Go fast and win.

17:31.316 --> 17:32.316
Oh.

17:32.318 --> 17:34.318
He made the bet.

17:34.320 --> 17:35.386
Let's go.

17:35.388 --> 17:38.589
You really think
Charity can win?

17:38.591 --> 17:40.625
Do I really think
Charity can win?

17:40.627 --> 17:42.260
Yeah.

17:42.262 --> 17:44.729
Well, I am
walking around
in yesterday's suit,

17:44.731 --> 17:47.665
and I
recall recently
telling my wife

17:47.667 --> 17:49.367
I was going
to stop gambling,

17:49.369 --> 17:51.202
that I was to move
back home

17:51.204 --> 17:53.104
after work
this morning.

17:53.106 --> 17:54.705
If I listen
closely,

17:54.707 --> 17:57.675
I can hear my wife
telling her attorney,
"Go for his balls."

17:57.677 --> 18:01.179
you're really asking
whether I think
Charity can win?

18:01.181 --> 18:02.246
Yeah.

18:02.248 --> 18:04.615
Yes! I think
Charity can win!

18:06.485 --> 18:09.387
I think Charity's
going to lose
by a nose.

19:12.451 --> 19:14.919
Nobody in
his right mind
bets the 4 horse!

19:20.392 --> 19:23.327
The 4 horse
is a joke, Trotter!

19:24.796 --> 19:26.397
I love this guy.

19:26.399 --> 19:29.400

on the 4 horse

19:29.402 --> 19:31.769

pictures taken.

19:31.771 --> 19:33.404

Hey!
Hey!

21:03.296 --> 21:04.795
Hey!
Hey!
Oh!
Hey!

21:04.797 --> 21:05.963
Here you go.

21:05.965 --> 21:08.633
$5 a space, 23, 24
spaces a race,

21:08.635 --> 21:12.403
9 races a day's
$1,400 a day.

21:12.405 --> 21:13.804
That's
a lot of money.

21:13.806 --> 21:18.909
<i>The horses have now</i>
<i>reached the starting gate.</i>

21:18.911 --> 21:21.646
Marty's horse
looks suicidal.

21:22.981 --> 21:25.449
Hey, who do you like
in the first?

21:25.451 --> 21:26.851
The 4 horse?

21:26.853 --> 21:29.453
Hey, down in front,
you big lug!

21:29.455 --> 21:31.055
Who said that?

21:34.459 --> 21:36.394
<i>Here come</i>
<i>the assistant starters</i>

21:36.396 --> 21:38.462
<i>to take ahold</i>
<i>of the runners.</i>

21:38.464 --> 21:39.630
<i>They're going in.</i>

21:39.632 --> 21:42.967
<i>loading into</i>
<i>the inside gate,</i>

21:42.969 --> 21:46.003
<i>joined by Dream Roadblock</i>
<i>going in quietly.</i>

21:46.005 --> 21:47.371
<i>Shy Ruler is next.</i>

21:47.373 --> 21:49.740
<i>He goes without</i>
<i>any problem.</i>

21:49.742 --> 21:51.976
Trot, I got
a bad feeling.

21:51.978 --> 21:54.612
No. For you to have
a bad feeling,

21:54.614 --> 21:56.347
you first needed
a good feeling,

21:56.349 --> 21:57.882
so you've no frame
of reference.

21:57.884 --> 21:59.950
<i>Charity hesitated</i>
<i>momentarily,</i>

21:59.952 --> 22:02.920
<i>but there goes Charity</i>
<i>in quietly now.</i>

22:05.057 --> 22:07.024
<i>Sink or Swim</i>
<i>coming forward.</i>

22:07.026 --> 22:10.961
<i>And it'll be Chiquita</i>
<i>Banana and Blurred Image.</i>

22:10.963 --> 22:13.364
<i>Guys and Dolls forward.</i>

22:13.366 --> 22:15.599
<i>The flag is up.</i>

22:18.603 --> 22:20.838
Yo! Yo!

22:22.774 --> 22:25.676
<i>Sink or Swim, second.</i>
<i>Let it Shine, third.</i>

22:25.678 --> 22:27.078
Get off the rail!

22:29.648 --> 22:32.583
Still a long way
to go.

22:32.585 --> 22:34.752
One more word,
I'll kill you.

22:34.754 --> 22:36.654
<i>Onto the backstretch</i>
<i>they go.</i>

22:36.656 --> 22:38.656
<i>That's the long shot,</i>
<i>Charity,</i>

22:38.658 --> 22:40.891
<i>opening up</i>
<i>by 3 lengths.</i>

22:40.893 --> 22:42.893
<i>Shy Ruler</i>
<i>is racing second,</i>

22:42.895 --> 22:44.495
<i>then it's Sink or Swim.</i>

22:44.497 --> 22:47.498
<i>Blurred Image is in</i>
<i>the middle of the pack,</i>

22:47.500 --> 22:50.568
<i>then Lo Fat,</i>
<i>and Guys and Dolls is last.</i>

22:50.570 --> 22:52.703
<i>They're coming</i>
<i>to the quarter pole.</i>

22:52.705 --> 22:54.038
<i>It's Charity, Blurred Image</i>
<i>on the outside...</i>

22:54.040 --> 22:55.506
Come on!

22:55.508 --> 22:56.674
Blurred Image!
That's Marty's horse!

22:56.676 --> 22:59.677
He might have picked
himself a winner!

22:59.679 --> 23:01.512
Don't do this
to me!

23:01.514 --> 23:02.780
<i>Blurred Image,</i>

23:02.782 --> 23:04.081
<i>Charity...</i>

23:04.083 --> 23:05.082
She's dying.

23:05.084 --> 23:06.117
Ooh.

23:06.119 --> 23:07.451
Ow!

23:07.453 --> 23:08.786
<i>Charity on the inside,</i>

23:08.788 --> 23:10.721
<i>Blurred Image</i>
<i>on the outside.</i>

23:10.723 --> 23:12.056
<i>They're nose to nose...</i>

23:12.058 --> 23:14.692
I thought
we had a deal!

23:20.465 --> 23:22.867
Who won? Who won?
Who won?

23:22.869 --> 23:24.769
Photo.

23:24.771 --> 23:26.137
Photo?

23:26.139 --> 23:27.671
Who's the photo?

23:27.673 --> 23:29.607
I'm glad
I didn't bet.

23:30.709 --> 23:31.876
You didn't bet?

23:31.878 --> 23:34.145
I would've had
a heart attack.

23:34.147 --> 23:36.914
I only bet
2 bucks on
the longest shot,

23:36.916 --> 23:39.483
so my heart
don't break.

23:39.485 --> 23:41.485
Why is it on so long?

23:41.487 --> 23:43.487
If Blurred Image
was Marty's horse,

23:43.489 --> 23:45.723
he'd be thrilled
if he won.

23:45.725 --> 23:47.691
I don't deserve
this anguish.

24:06.812 --> 24:09.613
Trotter, are you
all right?

24:09.615 --> 24:11.215
Have some nice beer.

24:11.217 --> 24:13.217
I quit drinking.

24:16.555 --> 24:18.456
The photo sign
went off.

24:18.458 --> 24:20.458
They got a winner.

24:20.460 --> 24:23.160
<i>The winner</i>
<i>of today's first race...</i>

24:23.162 --> 24:24.462
My god!

24:24.464 --> 24:26.897

You're rich!

24:35.541 --> 24:36.941
Is that official?

24:36.943 --> 24:38.242
<i>Is now official.</i>

24:38.244 --> 24:40.144
I can't believe
I didn't bet!

24:40.146 --> 24:43.514
What wonderful
people!

24:43.516 --> 24:45.816
I'd hate to have
to walk around this joint

24:45.818 --> 24:47.651
with $700 cash.

24:47.653 --> 24:50.821
710! And you'll never
have that problem

24:50.823 --> 24:52.723
because
the only reason I won

24:52.725 --> 24:54.225
is that you didn't bet!

24:54.227 --> 24:57.228
You are the unluckiest
person in the world!

24:57.230 --> 24:58.262

24:58.264 --> 24:59.497
Am.

24:59.499 --> 25:00.631
Am not.

25:00.633 --> 25:03.934

25:03.936 --> 25:06.203
The 6 horse
looks pretty good.

25:06.205 --> 25:08.506
Huh! You got a brother?

25:08.508 --> 25:09.807
In Cleveland.

25:09.809 --> 25:11.909
Call him up.
Ask him who he likes.

25:11.911 --> 25:13.177
It's in the blood.

25:13.179 --> 25:16.247
You had it! You knew!

25:16.249 --> 25:19.250
You're the unluckiest
person in the world!

25:19.252 --> 25:21.852
You don't have to
get personal.

25:32.197 --> 25:34.131
Congratulations.

This is
the only tape?

30:55.154 --> 30:57.487
Absolutely.

30:57.489 --> 31:00.390
The reason
I like this horse

31:00.392 --> 31:02.326
is that my jockey says

31:02.328 --> 31:04.328
that the jockey riding
this Faith Healer

31:04.330 --> 31:05.963
has got a grand

riding on him.

this loser saw

7 horse.

bucks on him.

You never know.

31:41.166 --> 31:42.432
You never know.

31:42.434 --> 31:44.034
You never know!

31:44.036 --> 31:45.235
Yeah!

31:47.906 --> 31:49.139
Yeah.

31:55.413 --> 31:57.047
Ha ha!

31:57.049 --> 31:59.683
Oh, yeah.

32:08.393 --> 32:10.427
Give me a burger.

32:10.429 --> 32:12.062
One burger.

32:12.064 --> 32:13.997
Why you like
this Faith Healer?

32:13.999 --> 32:16.099
You talking to me?

32:16.101 --> 32:18.402
I hear you're hot,
Trotter.

32:18.404 --> 32:20.537
'Cause I won
one lousy race?

32:20.539 --> 32:22.205
Well, you never know.

32:22.207 --> 32:25.976
I've seen
dumber guys than you
win two in a row.

32:25.978 --> 32:27.644
And 25, 2, 3--

32:27.646 --> 32:32.349
if I'd only bet $2.00,
I'd be up $28.

32:32.351 --> 32:34.184
Doesn't a hamburger
cost $1.50.

32:34.186 --> 32:35.652
Honest mistake.

32:38.489 --> 32:41.224
Why do you like
this Faith Healer?

32:41.226 --> 32:44.227
How do you know
I like Faith Healer?

32:44.229 --> 32:46.630
You might be
walking around lucky

32:46.632 --> 32:49.266
and not even know it.

32:49.268 --> 32:51.501
You know what I mean?

32:57.976 --> 32:59.009
Mmm!

32:59.011 --> 33:00.544
I just work here.

33:00.546 --> 33:01.545
Bah!

33:01.547 --> 33:03.080
You finished with that?

33:03.082 --> 33:05.215
Knock yourself
out, pal.

33:11.389 --> 33:13.290
Yo, Mr.. Trotter.

33:13.292 --> 33:16.059
Mr. Trotter, do you
have a minute?

33:16.061 --> 33:17.394
Yeah.

33:17.396 --> 33:20.630
Who you like in
the third, huh? Huh?

33:20.632 --> 33:22.232
Yeah. The 7 horse.

33:22.234 --> 33:23.567
The 7 horse.

33:23.569 --> 33:25.702
All right!

33:28.106 --> 33:30.073
I won't forget this.

33:30.075 --> 33:31.575
I will not forget this.

33:32.777 --> 33:35.445
680, 700.

33:35.447 --> 33:37.147
Ahem.

33:37.149 --> 33:38.749
Let it ride.

33:40.451 --> 33:41.718
Welcome home.

33:43.354 --> 33:44.554
On what?

33:46.190 --> 33:50.027
The win tickets
on Faith Healer.

33:50.029 --> 33:53.196
Most guys get lucky,

33:53.198 --> 33:55.098
they bet $3.00
in the next race.

33:55.100 --> 33:59.469
Just give me
the $50 win tickets
on the 7 horse.

34:14.318 --> 34:16.219
Hey, Trotter,
you've shrunk.

34:16.221 --> 34:18.588
We can make
lots of money.

34:18.590 --> 34:21.224
Take the tape
to the stables.

34:21.226 --> 34:22.793
Confront the trainer
with the evidence.

34:22.795 --> 34:25.195
With what he made,

34:25.197 --> 34:28.431
he won't mind
slipping us 5 grand.

34:28.434 --> 34:30.567
I got rid
of the tape.

34:30.569 --> 34:32.536
Aah!

34:32.538 --> 34:35.304
I saved you from
a lengthy jail sentence.

34:35.306 --> 34:37.306
I'll get you for this!

34:37.309 --> 34:40.243
<i>The horses have now</i>
<i>reached the starting gate.</i>

34:45.183 --> 34:48.452
50 bucks on June Bug
to win.

34:48.454 --> 34:52.155
It's the same name
as my cat.

34:52.157 --> 34:55.559
<i>And away they go!</i>

35:01.466 --> 35:03.266
Oh, yeah!

35:03.268 --> 35:04.734
Come on!

35:04.736 --> 35:06.736
<i>Faith Healer is going</i>
<i>best of all...</i>

35:06.738 --> 35:07.838
<i>Faith Healer's going</i>
<i>best of all...</i>

35:07.840 --> 35:09.506
Come on,
Faith Healer!

35:14.378 --> 35:17.114
<i>And it's Faith Healer...</i>

35:17.116 --> 35:19.449
Yes! Yes!
Yes! Yes!

35:19.451 --> 35:21.751
Yes! Yes!
Yes! Yes!

35:23.354 --> 35:26.423
I'm never, never
going to forget this!

35:26.425 --> 35:27.791
Never!

35:31.362 --> 35:34.764
And June Bug was the last one
<i>over the line.</i>

35:34.766 --> 35:36.366
Well, well, well.

35:36.368 --> 35:39.436
This will require
your autograph.

35:44.275 --> 35:45.642
And so will the IRS.

35:45.644 --> 35:48.678
You can't
win that much
without owning up.

35:54.852 --> 35:57.888
$2,450.

36:00.191 --> 36:01.558
Shoes?

36:01.560 --> 36:02.826
Ah!

36:15.339 --> 36:17.207
Mm-hmm.

36:58.416 --> 36:59.916
Ah!

37:07.725 --> 37:09.759
Thank you
very much, sir.

37:11.395 --> 37:12.929
My name is Greenberg.

37:14.599 --> 37:15.832
Vicki.

37:15.834 --> 37:17.334
Trotter.

37:17.336 --> 37:19.936
I'm pleased.

37:19.938 --> 37:21.605
I didn't realize

37:21.607 --> 37:25.575
we were having
a beauty contest
at the track today.

37:25.577 --> 37:29.012
He thinks you won
a beauty contest.

37:29.014 --> 37:31.014
I could have.

37:31.016 --> 37:32.682
If you didn't,
I'd have bought it.

37:32.684 --> 37:34.918
Bernie's rich.

37:34.920 --> 37:36.886
Nice meeting
both of you.

37:36.888 --> 37:37.988
Thank you.

37:37.990 --> 37:39.389
Likewise.

37:41.325 --> 37:43.593
What are you on
in the fifth?

37:43.595 --> 37:45.862
Who do you like
in the fifth?

37:45.864 --> 37:47.297
Hmm?

37:47.299 --> 37:49.966
Bernie lost his ass
already today.

37:49.968 --> 37:51.534
Whoa! Zip it.

37:51.536 --> 37:54.537
You want to know
my philosophy?

37:54.539 --> 37:55.572
Mm-hmm.

37:55.574 --> 37:57.540
If nobody knows
you got money,

37:57.542 --> 37:59.909
what the hell's the use
of having it?

37:59.911 --> 38:03.580
I got a condo
worth 700% more

38:03.582 --> 38:05.482
than I paid for it.

38:05.484 --> 38:07.917
I don't need
a place that big, huh?

38:07.919 --> 38:08.952
Mm-mmm.

38:08.954 --> 38:10.553
But I like space.

38:10.555 --> 38:12.022
Space.

38:12.024 --> 38:13.890
He likes space.

38:13.892 --> 38:15.992
Guess how many
bathrooms it has.

38:15.994 --> 38:17.527
I don't know.

38:17.529 --> 38:19.329
That's how many.

38:20.464 --> 38:23.033
He found six.

38:23.035 --> 38:25.035
Six bathrooms.

38:25.037 --> 38:27.837
I got to get even.
I'll bet a grand.

38:27.839 --> 38:29.039
Excuse me.

38:35.446 --> 38:36.680
She, uh...

38:36.682 --> 38:38.982
She's got very long legs.

38:38.984 --> 38:40.350
That's right.

38:40.352 --> 38:42.952
They go from my ass
to the floor--

38:42.954 --> 38:44.954
My legs.

38:44.956 --> 38:46.356
True.

38:52.930 --> 38:56.032
What would you
like to drink, sir?

38:56.034 --> 38:58.001
Any Wild Turkey
in season?

39:02.039 --> 39:03.907
Kill one for me.

39:06.644 --> 39:07.844
Thank you.

39:12.983 --> 39:14.918
Have you a pen
I might borrow?

39:14.920 --> 39:16.619
Will a pencil do?

39:16.621 --> 39:17.921
Yes, thank you.

39:17.923 --> 39:19.122
You're welcome.

39:21.492 --> 39:23.860
May I buy you
a drink?

39:23.862 --> 39:25.862
Sure. I'm on the pill.

39:29.734 --> 39:31.101
Rum.

39:31.103 --> 39:33.503
<i>The horses</i>
<i>for the fifth race</i>

39:33.505 --> 39:34.771
<i>now entering the track.</i>

39:34.773 --> 39:36.639
I like
the number 6 horse.

39:36.641 --> 39:37.674
Lord Byron.

39:37.676 --> 39:39.442
Mmm.

39:40.945 --> 39:42.645
I enjoy gambling.

39:42.647 --> 39:46.416
I'm having a good day.

39:46.418 --> 39:47.617
Mmm.

39:48.986 --> 39:51.721
Lord Byron.
Lord Byron.

39:51.723 --> 39:53.423
Byron--poet,

39:53.425 --> 39:55.392
poetas, poetamus,

39:55.394 --> 39:57.026
poetatus.

39:57.028 --> 39:58.828
Poetic...

39:59.897 --> 40:01.498
Like this room.

40:01.500 --> 40:03.600
Yes.

40:03.602 --> 40:05.568
Normally, I don't like
to bet the favorite,

40:05.570 --> 40:09.973
but $2,500 times 2
is 5 grand.

40:11.876 --> 40:13.143
Do you...

40:13.145 --> 40:14.744
come here...

40:16.046 --> 40:17.447
often?

40:17.449 --> 40:19.416
Every day.

40:19.418 --> 40:20.917
Really?

40:20.919 --> 40:22.519
You gamble
every day?

40:22.521 --> 40:23.720
Of course.

40:25.623 --> 40:27.056
Do you...

40:28.759 --> 40:31.828
Has gambling affected
your home life?

40:34.932 --> 40:37.066
[wheezing]

40:39.937 --> 40:41.471
Ruined it.

40:41.473 --> 40:42.939
Ha ha ha ha.

40:47.178 --> 40:49.179
Has gambling
affected your...

40:49.181 --> 40:50.647
reputation?

40:50.649 --> 40:54.050
Honey, some people
like to rub me for luck.

40:56.854 --> 40:58.888
Hurry up
with that rum!

41:01.125 --> 41:02.625
You feel lucky?

41:02.627 --> 41:03.827
I'm hot.

41:03.829 --> 41:05.995
I can tell.

41:05.997 --> 41:07.864
Lord...

41:07.866 --> 41:09.766
Byron.

41:09.768 --> 41:10.834
I like Lord Byron.

41:10.836 --> 41:12.669
I love Lord Byron.

41:18.609 --> 41:20.176
I think
I'll go bet it.

41:24.014 --> 41:25.014
Hi, Charlie.

41:25.016 --> 41:26.149
Hi, Vicki.

41:26.151 --> 41:27.484
Yo!
Aah!

41:27.486 --> 41:28.952
Sorry.

41:28.954 --> 41:30.520
I'm terribly sorry.

41:30.522 --> 41:31.888
Excuse me. Sorry.

41:33.591 --> 41:35.058
Can I get you
anything?

41:35.060 --> 41:36.059
No, thank you.

41:36.061 --> 41:37.060
Flowers?

41:37.062 --> 41:38.595
No, thank you.

41:38.597 --> 41:41.164
Quaaludes?

41:41.166 --> 41:42.999
One more collision
like that,

41:43.001 --> 41:44.801
and you're getting
fitted for glasses.

41:47.204 --> 41:49.072
Hey, what did I do?

41:49.074 --> 41:50.106
Ah.

41:50.108 --> 41:51.641
What did I do?

41:51.643 --> 41:53.776
There he is!

41:53.778 --> 41:55.678
You won't
be picking
more pockets.

41:55.680 --> 41:57.146
What the hell's
happening?

41:57.148 --> 41:58.748
Show me your I.D.

41:58.750 --> 42:01.084
You have the right
to remain silent.

42:01.086 --> 42:03.753
I want the right
to bet Lord Byron.

42:03.755 --> 42:05.154
Let's go, Morgan.

42:05.156 --> 42:06.222
Morgan? I'm not Morgan.

42:06.224 --> 42:07.757
Shut up.

42:07.759 --> 42:09.893
Tell them who I am.

42:09.895 --> 42:11.961
Tell the police officers
who I am.

42:11.963 --> 42:15.031
I've never seen
this man before
in my life.

42:15.033 --> 42:16.266
I'll kill you!

42:16.268 --> 42:18.668
I can't believe
you did this!

42:18.670 --> 42:19.969
We got Morgan here.

42:19.971 --> 42:21.638
I'm not Morgan!

42:21.640 --> 42:24.007
Do I look
like a Morgan?

42:24.009 --> 42:25.875
Sit down and shut up.

42:25.877 --> 42:27.610
We got Morgan here.

42:27.612 --> 42:31.014
I am not Morgan,
God damn it!

42:31.016 --> 42:32.649
Swearing in public's
illegal.

42:32.651 --> 42:34.584
So is
false arrest.

42:34.586 --> 42:35.718
Home address?

42:35.720 --> 42:40.156
<i>The horses have now</i>
<i>reached the starting gate.</i>

42:40.158 --> 42:42.592
This is
costing me $5,000.

42:42.594 --> 42:43.893
Quiet.

42:48.098 --> 42:49.999
Hey!

42:51.869 --> 42:53.136
Blast him!

42:53.138 --> 42:55.705
You can't shoot
a pickpocket!

42:55.707 --> 42:57.073
Out of the way!

42:57.075 --> 42:58.908
It must be a commercial.

43:01.845 --> 43:03.980
Why are you handcuffed?

43:05.215 --> 43:06.616
Move!

43:16.226 --> 43:18.194
<i>He's going in.</i>

43:18.196 --> 43:22.699
<i>Gay Lady a little restless</i>
<i>inside the gate.</i>

43:22.701 --> 43:24.167
<i>The flag is up.</i>

43:24.169 --> 43:25.201
Don't! No!

43:25.203 --> 43:27.236
<i>And away they go!</i>

43:27.238 --> 43:28.805
He did it!

43:28.807 --> 43:30.173
What did I do?

43:30.175 --> 43:31.274
Everything.

43:31.276 --> 43:33.142
<i>Paris Red is wide.</i>

43:33.144 --> 43:35.111
<i>Mismatched moves up</i>
<i>on the outside,</i>

43:35.113 --> 43:36.646
<i>4 lengths off the lead...</i>

43:36.648 --> 43:38.681
How do you
explain $2,400

43:38.683 --> 43:40.650
you got hidden
in your shoes?

43:40.652 --> 43:43.753
I'm having
a very good day!

43:43.755 --> 43:46.656
We're checking out
a Mr. J. Trotter.

43:46.658 --> 43:48.057
I'm going to kill you!

43:48.059 --> 43:52.295
2232-1/2
Flamingo Lane.

43:52.297 --> 43:53.796
Aah!

43:53.798 --> 43:55.198
<i>Lord Byron's in front.</i>

43:55.200 --> 43:57.800
He said he used
to work for you.

43:57.802 --> 43:59.802
<i>There's a shocking incident</i>
<i>of bumping,</i>

43:59.804 --> 44:02.672
<i>and Lord Byron</i>
<i>has lost the rider.</i>

44:02.674 --> 44:05.074
<i>Splendid Reason</i>
<i>gets up late to win it.</i>

44:05.076 --> 44:06.175
You do know him?

44:06.177 --> 44:07.844
<i>Splendid Reason wins it.</i>

44:07.846 --> 44:10.146
<i>Lord Byron is in front.</i>

44:10.148 --> 44:13.950
<i>There's a shocking incident</i>
<i>of bumping,</i>

44:13.952 --> 44:16.953
<i>and Lord Byron</i>
<i>has lost the rider.</i>

44:16.955 --> 44:19.722
Oh! That is a shocking
incident of bumping.

44:19.724 --> 44:22.659
<i>Splendid Reason</i>
<i>gets up late to win it.</i>

44:22.661 --> 44:24.661
I didn't lose.

44:24.663 --> 44:27.864
Weirder and weirder.

44:28.966 --> 44:30.733
I had the winner.

44:30.735 --> 44:32.769
I didn't lose.

44:34.104 --> 44:36.706
I should have lost,
but I didn't lose.

44:36.708 --> 44:38.675
There's a fine line

44:38.677 --> 44:40.443
between winning
and losing.

44:40.445 --> 44:42.412
Yes. The finish line.

44:48.719 --> 44:50.119
When you have money,

44:50.121 --> 44:52.321
you don't have to
worry about losing.

44:52.323 --> 44:54.023
I sell envelopes, see.

44:54.025 --> 44:56.926
If I lose 10 grand
at the track,

44:56.928 --> 44:59.896
I add a half a cent
to the prices

44:59.898 --> 45:01.264
of my oversized
birthday envelopes.

45:01.266 --> 45:02.799
I'll take
six dozen.

45:05.235 --> 45:09.138
<i>Dr. Trotter,</i>
<i>Dr. Jay Trotter,</i>

45:09.140 --> 45:12.075
<i>please pick up the nearest</i>
<i>courtesy phone.</i>

45:15.045 --> 45:17.146
I'll be right back.
Excuse me.

45:17.148 --> 45:19.782
Come back, doctor.

45:19.784 --> 45:21.384
Hmm.

45:22.453 --> 45:24.253
Some doctor.

45:24.255 --> 45:26.823
It's right over
there, sir.

45:26.825 --> 45:29.892
<i>We're calling for</i>
<i>trainer Mel Stute.</i>

45:29.894 --> 45:32.095
<i>Please contact</i>
<i>the jockey's room.</i>

45:32.097 --> 45:33.162
This is Dr. Trotter.

45:33.164 --> 45:34.897
Follow me,
please, sir.

45:44.808 --> 45:46.943
Miss Vicki.

45:48.212 --> 45:50.213
Some caviar, please.

45:50.215 --> 45:51.214
Yes, sir.

45:51.216 --> 45:52.815
And a little
champagne.

45:52.817 --> 45:54.317
Excellent.

45:54.319 --> 45:56.352
Honey, I knew
it was you.

45:56.354 --> 45:57.487
What's happening?

45:57.489 --> 45:59.088
Trotter, sweetheart,
honey, darling,

45:59.090 --> 46:01.424
what day is it?

46:01.426 --> 46:03.192
It's, uh,
Saturday, babe.

46:03.194 --> 46:04.193
Why?

46:04.195 --> 46:05.528
Saturday. Good.

46:05.530 --> 46:07.196
I see.

46:07.198 --> 46:10.199
I don't want to
assume something
I shouldn't.

46:10.201 --> 46:12.335
What time is it
exactly?

46:12.337 --> 46:14.237
It's, uh, 1:45, doll.

46:14.239 --> 46:16.305
It's 1:45, doll.

46:16.307 --> 46:18.808
And where are
you right now?

46:18.810 --> 46:21.944
In the jockey club.
You called me, remember?

46:21.946 --> 46:23.346
Yes, of course.

46:23.348 --> 46:25.948
If what you're
saying is true,

46:25.950 --> 46:29.352
you're in
the jockey club
at the racetrack

46:29.354 --> 46:31.020
at 1:45
Saturday afternoon

46:31.022 --> 46:33.289
when you were supposed
to be home at 12:30,

46:33.291 --> 46:35.525
starting
our marriage over!

46:35.527 --> 46:40.029
You lowlife
son of a bitch!

46:40.031 --> 46:41.230
You lousy bum!

46:41.232 --> 46:42.532
I hate your guts!

46:42.534 --> 46:44.133
Pam, listen--

46:44.135 --> 46:45.368
How could you--

46:45.370 --> 46:47.837
Excuse me. What the hell
am I saying?

46:47.839 --> 46:49.972
How could you
not do this?

46:49.974 --> 46:52.475
How could I expect
anything but this?

46:52.477 --> 46:54.410
You know something?
You're hopeless.

46:54.412 --> 46:57.313
I'm just as hopeless
to even conceive

46:57.315 --> 46:59.148
you'd have a smidgen
of consideration

46:59.150 --> 47:00.850
for my feelings.
Jesus!

47:00.852 --> 47:03.853
Excuse me. This is
a private conversation.

47:03.855 --> 47:05.454
Thanks, I appreciate it.

47:05.456 --> 47:06.823
You're lying,
you're gambling,

47:06.825 --> 47:08.891
you're making me
hate you.

47:08.893 --> 47:10.226
Pam, I'm not gambling.

47:10.228 --> 47:11.928
I am not gambling.

47:11.930 --> 47:13.429
I am winning.

47:13.431 --> 47:15.364
Liar, liar,
pants on fire.

47:15.366 --> 47:18.334
I wouldn't kid you.
I'm up $2,500.

47:18.336 --> 47:20.236
I'm having
a very good day.

47:20.238 --> 47:21.971
Having a good day?

47:21.973 --> 47:23.606
Well, good day this,
baby.

47:23.608 --> 47:25.208
I'm calling my attorney.

47:25.210 --> 47:27.944
I'll tell him
to go for your balls.

47:27.946 --> 47:29.145
Pam, listen--

47:29.147 --> 47:31.080
Trotter, this is it.

47:31.082 --> 47:32.949
I really do.
I'm finished.

47:32.951 --> 47:34.083
We are history.

47:34.085 --> 47:35.618
Listen to me.
Don't panic.

47:35.620 --> 47:37.186
Get all
gussied up--

47:37.188 --> 47:38.588
All gussied up?

47:38.590 --> 47:41.090
I want you
to come on down here

47:41.092 --> 47:42.491
and see for yourself.

47:42.493 --> 47:44.493
You won't believe it.

47:44.495 --> 47:46.062
If I come down,

47:46.064 --> 47:48.431
you won't believe
what's going on.

47:48.433 --> 47:51.367
Be here in 30 minutes.
I love you.

47:51.369 --> 47:53.069
Trotter?

47:53.071 --> 47:54.103
Trotter?

47:54.105 --> 47:55.938
♪ Ba ba ba boom

47:55.940 --> 47:57.907
♪ Ba boom

47:57.909 --> 47:58.941
[dial tone]

47:58.943 --> 48:00.309
Bastard.

48:04.081 --> 48:06.249
Maybe one,
one more time,

48:06.251 --> 48:08.551
but after that, no more.

48:08.553 --> 48:13.155
I thought we'd find
you at that dump
across the street.

48:13.157 --> 48:16.158
That dump,
Marty's, where
all the pigs wallow.

48:16.160 --> 48:17.393
I like your shoes.

48:17.395 --> 48:19.328
Buy them
at a carpet sale?

48:19.330 --> 48:21.998
Let's throw him
out the window.

48:22.000 --> 48:25.101
I hope someday
you're two seconds late.

48:25.103 --> 48:27.436
Where's your friend?
Looney?

48:27.438 --> 48:29.071
He's not my friend.

48:29.073 --> 48:32.041
Well, he's late.
He's late with some money.

48:32.043 --> 48:33.442
I wouldn't know.

48:33.444 --> 48:34.477
Hundreds late.

48:34.479 --> 48:37.313
Sickeningly
late. Late.

48:37.315 --> 48:38.314
Bernie.

48:38.316 --> 48:41.217
I swear to God,
I hate this.

48:41.219 --> 48:44.320
Makes
my stomach turn.

48:44.322 --> 48:47.256
Next week is me
giving you this back.

48:47.258 --> 48:48.457
Huh?

48:52.029 --> 48:54.063
The races
make me nervous.

48:54.065 --> 48:56.065
You can't beat an animal.

48:56.067 --> 48:58.501
Your friend Looney's
in trouble.

48:58.503 --> 49:00.002
He bet
the Packers today.

49:00.004 --> 49:01.203
So?

49:01.205 --> 49:03.406
So he bet them
pretty hard.

49:03.408 --> 49:05.641
They lost 75 to 10.

49:05.643 --> 49:08.411
Your pal Looney went
in for a nickel.

49:08.413 --> 49:11.047
I thought
he only bet $50.

49:11.049 --> 49:13.349
Your friend Looney's
down 800.

49:13.351 --> 49:16.686
Which is a lot
for a bum.

49:16.688 --> 49:18.654
When you see
your buddy,

49:18.656 --> 49:22.091
please, please
pass along this message--

49:22.093 --> 49:24.060
Pay up.

49:24.062 --> 49:26.028
P.S.

49:26.030 --> 49:27.463
Or else.

49:27.465 --> 49:29.398
I don't really think

49:29.400 --> 49:31.567
I'll be seeing
Mr. Looney any time soon.

49:31.569 --> 49:33.035
Excuse me.

49:35.505 --> 49:36.672
Let's have
another beer.

49:36.674 --> 49:38.975
Anybody seen Looney?

49:38.977 --> 49:41.043
I may draw some savings

49:41.045 --> 49:42.478
and get back
what we lost.

49:42.480 --> 49:44.613
I am pretty mad.

49:44.615 --> 49:45.748
You seen Looney?

49:45.750 --> 49:47.717
Everybody's
looking for Looney.

49:47.719 --> 49:49.685
Looney said
you were a jerk.

49:49.687 --> 49:51.187
Where is he?

49:51.189 --> 49:52.755
Lufkin was
looking for him.

49:52.757 --> 49:54.490
He left a number.

49:54.492 --> 49:56.559
Looney said you
turned on your friends.

49:56.561 --> 49:57.760
Where is he?

49:57.762 --> 49:59.362
He's giving blood.

49:59.364 --> 50:00.596
We can give blood.

50:00.598 --> 50:05.334
I am pretty cheesed off
about that jockey

50:05.336 --> 50:08.437
falling off
that damn horse, Sid.

50:08.439 --> 50:09.705
Looney.

50:11.575 --> 50:12.675
Looney.

50:12.677 --> 50:15.277
What?

50:15.279 --> 50:17.380
Looney,

50:17.382 --> 50:19.448
what are you doing?

50:19.450 --> 50:20.783
I'm being embalmed,

50:20.785 --> 50:22.685
if it's any
business of yours.

50:22.687 --> 50:24.687
Lufkin is
looking for you.

50:24.689 --> 50:26.122
So?

50:26.124 --> 50:28.257
He says
you're over the limit.

50:28.259 --> 50:30.393
Dead men
can't pay up.

50:30.395 --> 50:32.628
Don't go back
to the track.

50:32.630 --> 50:34.764
I can't believe
you screwed me.

50:34.766 --> 50:36.098
I didn't screw you.

50:36.100 --> 50:38.567
I made the bet
that we both bet.

50:38.569 --> 50:43.239
I lost $50 on the one
named after my cat.

50:43.241 --> 50:45.241
In the seventh,
there's one named
after my apartment.

50:45.243 --> 50:46.409
I'm going back.

50:46.411 --> 50:50.046
Great place to spend
the afternoon

50:50.048 --> 50:53.115
with your friend,
until he sneaks off
and screws you!

50:53.117 --> 50:54.517
I did not!

50:54.519 --> 50:55.718
You, out.

50:58.155 --> 51:01.090
Give my regards
to your pals

51:01.092 --> 51:03.059
at that whorehouse
where you're sitting.

51:07.097 --> 51:08.330
Look, uh...

51:10.167 --> 51:13.169
tell the guy back there
his blood is rare.

51:13.171 --> 51:16.172
He gets 20 rather
than the regular 10.

51:16.174 --> 51:17.506
His blood is rare.

51:17.508 --> 51:20.242
He gets $75.

51:20.244 --> 51:21.444
75?

51:24.414 --> 51:27.083
75 twice a week
is $150.

51:27.085 --> 51:28.517
That's a lot
of money.

51:28.519 --> 51:30.619
A round of
banana daiquiris.

51:30.621 --> 51:33.622
There's a Banana King
in the next race.

51:33.624 --> 51:35.224
You're kidding.
Where?

51:35.226 --> 51:37.226
Where's the money?

51:38.328 --> 51:39.361
We're married.

51:39.363 --> 51:40.629
Oh, well,

51:40.631 --> 51:41.831
we're not.

51:43.366 --> 51:45.234
Give me the money
for safekeeping.

51:45.236 --> 51:46.602
It's in my shoes.

51:46.604 --> 51:47.703
Give me the money.

51:47.705 --> 51:49.672
Aah!

51:49.674 --> 51:52.675
There are purse snatchers
all over this joint!

51:52.677 --> 51:54.677
Put this
on your list,

51:54.679 --> 51:56.212
Mr. I-Won't-Gamble-Anymore.

51:56.214 --> 51:58.380
What happened
to that, huh?

51:58.382 --> 52:00.716
Why don't you
give me some money

52:00.718 --> 52:04.553
and you can keep $10
if you have to bet.

52:04.555 --> 52:08.457
Why can't you
watch the horses
run around the track

52:08.459 --> 52:10.459
and not bet on them?

52:13.330 --> 52:15.531
She's new.

52:15.533 --> 52:16.866
What's so damn funny.

52:16.868 --> 52:21.170
Because there
is no racing
without betting.

52:21.172 --> 52:22.805
That's poetic.

52:22.807 --> 52:24.874
Oh, please! Airhead.

52:24.876 --> 52:26.609
Excuse me?

52:26.611 --> 52:28.410
I don't want you
to lose all our money.

52:28.412 --> 52:30.846
Pam, darling,
sweetheart,

52:30.848 --> 52:32.715
I'm begging you,

52:32.717 --> 52:34.250
be quiet.

52:34.252 --> 52:35.651
Give me that money,

52:35.653 --> 52:37.386
or I'll cause a scene.

52:37.388 --> 52:38.721
Remember
your mother's house?

52:38.723 --> 52:39.755
The plate glass window?

52:39.757 --> 52:40.756
OK.

52:40.758 --> 52:41.924
Ok, what?

52:41.926 --> 52:43.159
I'm going
to the men's room.

52:43.161 --> 52:44.360
Why?

52:44.362 --> 52:45.828
Take my shoes off.

52:45.830 --> 52:47.396
I don't trust you!

52:47.398 --> 52:50.866
You don't want me
to make a scene here.

53:09.686 --> 53:11.220
Terribly sorry.

53:12.455 --> 53:14.490
Here comes the champ!

53:14.492 --> 53:16.892
I mean it,
you are the champ.

53:16.894 --> 53:19.929
You've got
more guts than sense.

53:19.931 --> 53:22.231
What do you want?

53:22.233 --> 53:23.599
I don't know.

53:23.601 --> 53:25.367
Give me a number.

53:25.369 --> 53:27.269
I'll be right back.

53:27.271 --> 53:29.538
I believe you will.

53:29.540 --> 53:31.307
I'm taking a survey.

53:31.309 --> 53:32.675
Who do you like?

53:32.677 --> 53:34.910
The 2 horse.
He's got front wraps.

53:34.912 --> 53:36.979
I always bet a horse
with front wraps.

53:36.981 --> 53:38.547
I'm taking a survey.

53:38.549 --> 53:39.949
Go with your lungs.

53:39.951 --> 53:42.685
Lay big money
on the 4 horse.

53:42.687 --> 53:44.587
Who do you like?

53:44.589 --> 53:46.555
6 is the horse.

53:46.557 --> 53:48.791
I always
bet on 5.

53:48.793 --> 53:49.825
Who do you like?

53:49.827 --> 53:51.894
Up yours.
The number 1 horse.

53:51.896 --> 53:52.928
Thank you.

53:52.930 --> 53:54.730
I like the 4.

53:54.732 --> 53:56.699
These other nags
will die.

53:56.701 --> 53:58.467
At the eighth pole,

53:58.469 --> 54:00.669
they'll look like
they're at a bus stop.

54:00.671 --> 54:02.404
I'm taking the survey.
You take your own.

54:02.406 --> 54:03.439
I like the 6.

54:03.441 --> 54:04.540
The 4.

54:04.542 --> 54:05.541
1 horse.

54:05.543 --> 54:07.543
I like the 6 horse.

54:11.982 --> 54:13.015
3.

54:13.017 --> 54:14.650
What do you mean, 3?

54:14.652 --> 54:16.485
3 to win.

54:16.487 --> 54:17.620
Let it ride.

54:17.622 --> 54:20.289
Do you know
what you're doing?

54:20.291 --> 54:22.358
Of sound mind?

54:22.360 --> 54:24.360
I'm not asking
for a will.

54:24.362 --> 54:25.794
I'm asking for 48
$50 win tickets

54:25.796 --> 54:27.630
on the 3 horse
in the seventh race.

54:27.632 --> 54:29.665
You want 48
$50 win tickets

54:29.667 --> 54:31.934
on the 3 horse
in the seventh race?

54:31.936 --> 54:38.540
So I have to give you
48 $50 win tickets

54:38.542 --> 54:41.543
on the 3 horse
in the seventh race.

54:43.680 --> 54:47.950
How much does
48 $50 win tickets

54:47.952 --> 54:51.553
on the 3 horse
in the seventh race pay?

54:51.555 --> 54:52.688
Hmm.

54:52.690 --> 54:55.057
48 $50 win tickets

54:55.059 --> 54:56.959
on the 3 horse
in the seventh race

54:56.961 --> 54:58.961
at...

54:58.963 --> 55:00.663
25 to 1...

55:00.665 --> 55:02.865
will pay you...

55:08.571 --> 55:11.907
approximately
$69,000.

55:11.909 --> 55:14.476
This is
a lot of money.

55:14.478 --> 55:19.648
Don't you want
to hold back some
just in case?

55:19.650 --> 55:20.749
Why?

55:20.751 --> 55:24.019
In case you get
hungry or thirsty.

55:26.723 --> 55:28.357
Aha.

55:51.381 --> 55:53.082
Thanks.

56:05.595 --> 56:07.629
It's quiet.

56:12.035 --> 56:14.536
I do this
for a living.

56:14.538 --> 56:17.773
Been doing it
for 15 years.

56:19.809 --> 56:21.043
I play the circuit.

56:21.045 --> 56:22.378
Mm-hmm.

56:22.380 --> 56:24.513
One track closes,
another one opens.

56:24.515 --> 56:25.914
Some big places,

56:25.916 --> 56:27.916
some dumps.

56:27.918 --> 56:30.786
I met all kinds
of characters.

56:30.788 --> 56:34.456
But believe me, pal,
you are the champ.

56:34.458 --> 56:36.692
I really hope you win.

56:36.694 --> 56:40.396
Yep. You're the greatest
I've ever seen.

56:40.398 --> 56:42.631
I'll tell my
grandchildren about you.

56:42.633 --> 56:43.999
Thanks.

56:50.940 --> 56:52.674
[buzz]

56:52.676 --> 56:54.643
will you escort
this gentleman

56:54.645 --> 56:57.179
to his seat and stay
with him if necessary.

56:57.181 --> 56:59.047
Yes, sir.

57:00.683 --> 57:01.884
Hi.

57:04.087 --> 57:05.521
Coming through.

57:23.473 --> 57:27.075
You've been arrested?

57:27.077 --> 57:28.610
Where's the money?

57:32.615 --> 57:33.615
No.

57:33.617 --> 57:35.918
No, please!

57:35.920 --> 57:37.052
No!

57:37.054 --> 57:38.587
I had to.

57:40.089 --> 57:41.990
You lying
son of a bitch!

57:41.992 --> 57:43.192
Lay off.

57:43.194 --> 57:44.693
Mind your
own business.

57:44.695 --> 57:47.029
She's pert,
if you like pert.

57:48.498 --> 57:50.699
Although nobody
likes the 3.

57:50.701 --> 57:52.100
What is she
talking about?

57:52.102 --> 57:54.102
You want another round?

57:54.104 --> 57:55.170
You're sick.

57:55.172 --> 57:56.839
You should
be hospitalized.

57:56.841 --> 57:58.207
I just got it.

57:58.209 --> 58:01.009
I just got something
real important.

58:01.011 --> 58:03.645
After
all these years,

58:03.647 --> 58:05.981
it's not my gambling
you despise,

58:05.983 --> 58:07.516
it's been my losing.

58:11.020 --> 58:13.822
I'm going to end
this marriage now

58:13.824 --> 58:15.591
because if I don't,

58:15.593 --> 58:17.259
I'll have
a nervous breakdown.

58:18.795 --> 58:20.596
I'm going home.

58:20.598 --> 58:21.964
Good.

58:23.867 --> 58:26.568
Want me to call you
when I win?

58:26.570 --> 58:28.971
Yes! Call this!

58:31.975 --> 58:35.210
We're having
some problems.

58:35.212 --> 58:36.912
Poor Trotter.

58:36.914 --> 58:40.015
Poor, poor Trotter.

58:40.017 --> 58:42.518
You're looking
at 69 grand

58:42.520 --> 58:43.952
or you're
looking at nothing.

58:49.626 --> 58:52.761
I have a house
in the Bahamas.

58:52.763 --> 58:54.029
He's mine.

58:54.031 --> 58:55.931
You're mine.

58:55.933 --> 58:58.066
<i>The horses are approaching</i>
<i>the starting gate.</i>

59:08.678 --> 59:12.581
<i>The horses have now</i>
<i>reached the starting gate.</i>

59:14.884 --> 59:16.919
[coughing]

59:21.758 --> 59:23.892
<i>The horses</i>
<i>are all in line.</i>

59:27.196 --> 59:29.598
<i>The flag is up.</i>

59:29.600 --> 59:32.868

59:32.870 --> 59:33.869
<i>Up Yours, Rock It</i>
<i>and Moonbeams</i>

59:37.608 --> 59:39.141
<i>Banana King</i>

59:39.143 --> 59:40.609

59:40.611 --> 59:42.010
Come on, Fleet Dreams!

59:42.012 --> 59:44.079

59:44.081 --> 59:46.882

59:48.285 --> 59:50.018
Come on, Fleet Dreams!

59:50.020 --> 59:51.219
Come on, 4!

59:51.221 --> 59:52.788
Come on! Come on!

59:52.790 --> 59:53.789
Come on.

59:53.791 --> 59:55.090
Come on, 4!

59:55.092 --> 59:57.759

59:59.629 --> 01:00:01.029
Come on, baby!

01:00:01.031 --> 01:00:02.331
Come on, baby!

01:00:02.333 --> 01:00:03.665
Come on, baby!

01:00:03.667 --> 01:00:05.200
Come on, baby!

01:00:05.202 --> 01:00:07.202
Come on,
you son of a bitch!

01:00:07.204 --> 01:00:10.172
<i>And Banana King is</i>
<i>on the outside...</i>

01:00:10.174 --> 01:00:12.274
Come on,

01:00:12.276 --> 01:00:13.775
Come on.

01:00:13.777 --> 01:00:15.377
Come on, 4!

01:00:29.693 --> 01:00:31.293

<i>Fleet Dreams</i>
<i>has won it...</i>

01:01:01.324 --> 01:01:02.924
You're a millionaire.

01:01:02.926 --> 01:01:04.226
I've had
enough of that.

01:01:04.228 --> 01:01:06.228
Trotter won
all that money.

01:01:06.230 --> 01:01:08.664
Get up,
you crazy bitch!

01:01:08.666 --> 01:01:10.098
Get out of here.

01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:11.767
Jesus Christ!

01:01:11.769 --> 01:01:12.934
Did I win?

01:01:12.936 --> 01:01:16.038
Son of a bitch!

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:17.372
I won!

01:01:17.374 --> 01:01:19.174
I won.
Son of a bitch!

01:01:19.176 --> 01:01:21.376
Son of a bitch
fucking flying,

01:01:21.378 --> 01:01:23.712
son of a bitch
fucking flying whore.

01:01:23.714 --> 01:01:25.313
God likes me!

01:01:25.315 --> 01:01:28.150
He really,
really likes me!

01:01:28.152 --> 01:01:30.719
What a day!
What a day!

01:01:30.721 --> 01:01:33.288
What a fabulous day!

01:01:33.290 --> 01:01:35.991
I'm having
a fabulous day!

01:01:35.993 --> 01:01:38.326
They ought to guard
the back door,

01:01:38.328 --> 01:01:41.897
so that sort
doesn't get in.

01:01:41.899 --> 01:01:43.832
Fix your God damn skirt.

01:01:43.834 --> 01:01:45.200
OK, Bernie.

01:01:48.337 --> 01:01:50.038
Can't hold his liquor.

01:01:51.774 --> 01:01:54.309
You might have mentioned.

01:01:54.311 --> 01:01:55.310
What?

01:01:55.312 --> 01:01:56.978
The 3 horse.

01:01:56.980 --> 01:02:00.148
You might have mentioned
you liked him.

01:02:00.150 --> 01:02:01.783
I could use
some extra money.

01:02:01.785 --> 01:02:05.420
Want to know
how I got the 3 horse?

01:02:05.422 --> 01:02:07.756
You want to know?

01:02:07.758 --> 01:02:10.158
I went out
in the thing,

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:11.760
and, I, I...

01:02:11.762 --> 01:02:13.228
Oh, screw it.

01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:16.064
I hate
people who sneak
around and bet.

01:02:16.066 --> 01:02:19.735
A classmate covered
up his answers
like a sissy.

01:02:19.737 --> 01:02:21.803
Who cares? Who cares?

01:02:23.072 --> 01:02:26.775
Waiter, more champagne.

01:02:26.777 --> 01:02:29.878
We're very
busy now, sir.

01:02:40.957 --> 01:02:43.258
Bllll!

01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:46.328
That's for all
you stuffy rat bastards.

01:02:53.002 --> 01:02:59.207
I'm going to
collect $69,000.

01:03:00.543 --> 01:03:01.209
Grrr.

01:03:05.882 --> 01:03:08.183
I'm hiring you.
100 bucks an hour.

01:03:08.185 --> 01:03:09.351
Don't worry
about anything.

01:03:09.353 --> 01:03:10.786
Anybody who
makes a funny move,

01:03:10.788 --> 01:03:11.953
shoot them.

01:03:11.955 --> 01:03:13.255
Hey, Trotter!

01:03:16.192 --> 01:03:17.893
No. That's OK.

01:03:17.895 --> 01:03:18.960
I know this guy!

01:03:18.962 --> 01:03:21.163
Hey! Pay up,
you deadbeat!

01:03:21.165 --> 01:03:23.398
No. Don't shoot
anybody yet!

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:25.500
I haven't
collected my money.

01:03:25.502 --> 01:03:28.036
I don't like you
one fuck.

01:03:28.038 --> 01:03:29.938
If I hear
another profanity,

01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:31.807
I'll blast
your head off.

01:03:31.809 --> 01:03:33.041
Oh, really?

01:03:33.043 --> 01:03:34.176
That's correct.

01:03:34.178 --> 01:03:37.145
I lost the money
from the blood bank.

01:03:37.147 --> 01:03:38.446
I'm not surprised.

01:03:38.448 --> 01:03:39.948
My pocket was picked.

01:03:39.950 --> 01:03:41.950
Is this
the social hour?

01:03:41.952 --> 01:03:44.286
You owe me,
you greasy deadbeat.

01:03:44.288 --> 01:03:45.587
I'm going
to get it.

01:03:45.589 --> 01:03:50.125
How much exactly does
Mr. Looney owe you?

01:03:50.127 --> 01:03:51.560
850.

01:03:51.562 --> 01:03:53.161
Grrr.

01:03:53.163 --> 01:03:55.931
I was at Marty's
on the phone.

01:03:55.933 --> 01:03:57.299
I was going
to bet $50.

01:03:57.301 --> 01:04:00.836
Then I said, "give me
500 on the Packers."

01:04:00.838 --> 01:04:03.305
It was like
somebody else saying it.

01:04:03.307 --> 01:04:05.273
Let him kill me.

01:04:07.877 --> 01:04:11.346
I'll pay for Looney
when I settle here, OK?

01:04:11.348 --> 01:04:12.581
You don't have
to do that.

01:04:12.583 --> 01:04:14.349
I'll get
my own money.

01:04:14.351 --> 01:04:15.483
I'll kill somebody.

01:04:15.485 --> 01:04:17.419
Watch it!

01:04:17.421 --> 01:04:20.388
When's the last time
I won? Look it up.

01:04:24.427 --> 01:04:27.295
December 3rd.
Three years ago.

01:04:27.297 --> 01:04:28.930
22 bucks.

01:04:28.932 --> 01:04:32.000
I'm a loser.
I deserve to die.

01:04:32.002 --> 01:04:35.003
When I collect here,
I settle Looney's sheet.

01:04:35.005 --> 01:04:37.906
I'm committed
to you for my life.

01:04:37.908 --> 01:04:40.909
You're the greatest man
that ever lived.

01:04:40.911 --> 01:04:42.577
That sounds
fine to me.

01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:47.349
$69,000.

01:04:47.351 --> 01:04:51.286
I want champagne sent
to Fleet Dream's stall

01:04:51.288 --> 01:04:53.321
and two dozen roses
sent to the owner.

01:04:53.323 --> 01:04:56.925
A case of light beer
sent to the jockey.

01:04:56.927 --> 01:04:58.593
The government's
taking half. That's...

01:04:58.595 --> 01:05:00.528
34,5.

01:05:00.530 --> 01:05:03.632
8 on the Buick,
4 1/2 on the furniture.

01:05:03.634 --> 01:05:06.968
Pam wants
a water cruise. That's 4.

01:05:06.970 --> 01:05:09.170
12 years rent,
200 for champagne,

01:05:09.172 --> 01:05:11.172
100 for the roses.

01:05:11.174 --> 01:05:12.440
40.

01:05:12.442 --> 01:05:15.677
100 for the broken glass
at the jockey club.

01:05:15.679 --> 01:05:17.245
50.

01:05:17.247 --> 01:05:19.915
8 1/2 for Looney's tab,

01:05:19.917 --> 01:05:21.182
that leaves me with...

01:05:21.184 --> 01:05:22.584
zero...

01:05:22.586 --> 01:05:23.585
zero...

01:05:23.587 --> 01:05:24.986
zero.

01:05:24.988 --> 01:05:26.621
Congratulations.

01:05:28.090 --> 01:05:29.691
I'm broke.

01:05:31.994 --> 01:05:33.061
Looney.

01:05:33.063 --> 01:05:35.063
About that 850 you owe.

01:05:35.065 --> 01:05:37.065
There's all kinds
of love.

01:05:37.067 --> 01:05:39.067
I've got bad news.

01:05:39.069 --> 01:05:42.470
My love is man to man,
friend to friend.

01:05:42.472 --> 01:05:45.073
You're a prince,
my king.

01:05:45.075 --> 01:05:46.141
Aw, hell.

01:05:46.143 --> 01:05:47.509
You'll be back.

01:05:47.511 --> 01:05:50.211
Not me.
I've seen the light.

01:05:52.615 --> 01:05:54.616
Excuse me.

01:05:54.618 --> 01:05:56.318
I hate to interrupt,

01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:57.953
but somebody
owes me some change.

01:05:57.955 --> 01:06:00.689
Nobody make
a false move.

01:06:03.492 --> 01:06:05.627
He looks different.

01:06:11.367 --> 01:06:14.302
I have peripheral
vision. It's a gift.

01:06:14.304 --> 01:06:16.304
I can see my ears.

01:06:16.306 --> 01:06:20.442
A guy's throwing up
on a pool table to my left.

01:06:20.444 --> 01:06:23.611
Two guys are
sleeping on the right.

01:06:23.613 --> 01:06:25.313
A bulb's burned out.

01:06:25.315 --> 01:06:28.316
There's a fly
on the money box.

01:06:28.318 --> 01:06:31.419
What is this crap?

01:06:34.123 --> 01:06:36.257
[ring]

01:06:36.259 --> 01:06:37.592
Hello.

01:06:37.594 --> 01:06:39.361
Hi, honey.

01:06:39.363 --> 01:06:40.762
Don't honey me.

01:06:40.764 --> 01:06:42.731
Besides, I'm drunk.

01:06:42.733 --> 01:06:44.099
Pam, um...

01:06:44.101 --> 01:06:46.301
you know that race,

01:06:46.303 --> 01:06:48.136
the one
you left before?

01:06:48.138 --> 01:06:50.672
I've decided
to become an alcoholic.

01:06:50.674 --> 01:06:54.342
It's the healthiest
thing I've ever done
for myself.

01:06:54.344 --> 01:06:56.644
I won.

01:06:56.646 --> 01:06:58.346
We're pretty rich.

01:06:58.348 --> 01:07:01.416
I'm going
to drink every day.

01:07:01.418 --> 01:07:04.119
Bottles of gin,
six packs.

01:07:04.121 --> 01:07:06.421
I'm going to hide
bottles around the house.

01:07:06.423 --> 01:07:08.723
I'm never going
to cook or clean

01:07:08.725 --> 01:07:12.060
or, or, take baths.

01:07:12.062 --> 01:07:13.728
You can sell
the bed if you want,

01:07:13.730 --> 01:07:15.363
make bets with it

01:07:15.365 --> 01:07:17.632
because I'll be
passing out on the floor

01:07:17.634 --> 01:07:19.467
from now on because...

01:07:19.469 --> 01:07:20.735
Pam!

01:07:20.737 --> 01:07:23.338
You can sell
the refrigerator, too.

01:07:23.340 --> 01:07:27.475
All of the money is
in a little green box.

01:07:30.813 --> 01:07:33.081
Pam?

01:07:33.083 --> 01:07:36.484
I'm drinking gin and
flicking ashes on the floor.

01:07:36.486 --> 01:07:38.586
I couldn't leave you,

01:07:38.588 --> 01:07:40.822
so I decided
this is the only way.

01:07:40.824 --> 01:07:42.123
Pammie, honey...

01:07:42.125 --> 01:07:43.358
Go and make your bet.

01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:44.759
Give me a call.

01:07:44.761 --> 01:07:47.729
I'll be here,
passed out in vomit.

01:07:47.731 --> 01:07:49.564
We have to talk.

01:07:49.566 --> 01:07:52.167
You can move back, Jay.

01:07:53.836 --> 01:07:55.170
I missed you
all the time.

01:07:55.172 --> 01:07:57.439
Oh, Pam.

01:08:01.844 --> 01:08:03.611
I really love you.

01:08:03.613 --> 01:08:05.847
Oh, that's...

01:08:05.849 --> 01:08:08.450
very sweet.

01:08:08.452 --> 01:08:09.551
Pamela?

01:08:09.553 --> 01:08:12.087
I'm sorry.
I dropped the phone.

01:08:12.089 --> 01:08:14.456
Could you
pick up some wine?

01:08:14.458 --> 01:08:15.590
I love you.

01:08:15.592 --> 01:08:17.792
Do you--Do you
mean that?

01:08:17.794 --> 01:08:19.560
Of course I do.

01:08:21.296 --> 01:08:22.729
Mean what?

01:08:22.732 --> 01:08:24.666
Honey?

01:08:24.667 --> 01:08:27.402
Yeah? Good night.

01:08:27.404 --> 01:08:29.304
Hel--

01:08:40.816 --> 01:08:44.352
What do you want
to do with the assets?

01:08:55.531 --> 01:08:58.800
[snoring]

01:08:58.801 --> 01:09:01.169
Honey, I'm home.

01:09:01.171 --> 01:09:02.804
Pam?

01:09:02.805 --> 01:09:04.205
Pammie?

01:09:08.410 --> 01:09:10.444
I didn't bet.

01:09:11.814 --> 01:09:13.915
Pam, we're rich.

01:09:17.553 --> 01:09:20.154
I got you
a little bubbly,

01:09:20.157 --> 01:09:22.189
and...

01:09:22.192 --> 01:09:24.926
I got you a nice
little gift here.

01:09:30.299 --> 01:09:32.466
Huh?

01:09:32.469 --> 01:09:33.667
Huh?

01:09:33.670 --> 01:09:35.370
Honey?

01:09:35.372 --> 01:09:36.571
Honey?

01:09:36.573 --> 01:09:38.740
Sweetie, honey?

01:09:42.578 --> 01:09:44.812
OK.

01:09:44.814 --> 01:09:46.214
Ah.

01:09:47.917 --> 01:09:51.886
$69,000.

01:09:53.389 --> 01:09:54.789
Nine...

01:09:54.791 --> 01:09:57.225
Piles of tiles?

01:09:57.227 --> 01:10:00.361
What does it mean?

01:10:29.959 --> 01:10:32.594
5 of clubs.

01:10:48.344 --> 01:10:50.478
This horse could only
be ridden

01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:51.713
by a Chinese jockey.

01:10:51.715 --> 01:10:53.281
Yeah,
in the first race.

01:10:53.283 --> 01:10:54.849
The racehorse
was four generations.

01:10:54.851 --> 01:10:56.017
It's him!

01:10:56.019 --> 01:10:57.719
It's him! He's here!

01:10:57.721 --> 01:10:59.454
[crowd roars]

01:11:03.993 --> 01:11:06.394
I knew it!
I knew it!

01:11:06.396 --> 01:11:07.862
Thank you.

01:11:10.499 --> 01:11:11.699
Trotter!

01:11:11.701 --> 01:11:13.768
Trotter! Trotter!
Trotter! Trotter!

01:11:13.770 --> 01:11:15.336
Trotter! Trotter!

01:11:15.338 --> 01:11:16.971
Trotter!
Trotter!
Trotter! Trotter!

01:11:16.973 --> 01:11:18.473
Now, that's a man.

01:11:20.409 --> 01:11:22.944
You know,
all these bums here

01:11:22.946 --> 01:11:24.946
said you
were a quitter.

01:11:24.948 --> 01:11:26.748
But I defended you.

01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:29.984
A toast...

01:11:29.986 --> 01:11:31.619
to Trotter!

01:11:33.822 --> 01:11:35.757
You're all great friends.

01:11:37.726 --> 01:11:38.926
And who needs money

01:11:38.928 --> 01:11:40.461
when you got friends?

01:11:40.463 --> 01:11:41.562
That's right.

01:11:41.564 --> 01:11:42.964
And don't worry

01:11:42.966 --> 01:11:44.565
because
we'll all be here

01:11:44.567 --> 01:11:47.302
to pick you up
when it's over.

01:11:49.571 --> 01:11:52.073
I, uh...

01:11:52.075 --> 01:11:53.775
I got an idea.

01:11:55.311 --> 01:11:57.345
You got a horse
picked out?

01:11:57.347 --> 01:12:00.448
Now...I'm hot, right?

01:12:01.984 --> 01:12:05.486
I am truly hot.

01:12:05.488 --> 01:12:10.458
And there is nothing more
important than friendship.

01:12:10.460 --> 01:12:13.361
Now, here's what
we're going to do.

01:12:13.363 --> 01:12:15.930
We're going to take
everything we've got--

01:12:15.932 --> 01:12:17.532
everything I've got,

01:12:17.534 --> 01:12:19.033
and everything
you've got.

01:12:20.703 --> 01:12:22.403
Every last cent...

01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:27.108
we're going
to put it all together

01:12:27.110 --> 01:12:28.776
into one big pile.

01:12:30.779 --> 01:12:35.016
And we're going
to bet it together!

01:12:54.970 --> 01:12:56.971
Looney.

01:12:56.973 --> 01:12:58.573
I'm hot.

01:12:58.575 --> 01:12:59.707
[groans]

01:12:59.709 --> 01:13:02.143
I'm hot! Listen to me!

01:13:03.979 --> 01:13:05.880
This is the chance

01:13:05.882 --> 01:13:08.416
that you have all
been waiting for.

01:13:10.519 --> 01:13:13.488
The next race, I'm
putting a 27 star.

01:13:13.490 --> 01:13:16.057
It's good,
but I wouldn't
bet my grandmother.

01:13:16.059 --> 01:13:17.625
I wouldn't either.

01:13:17.627 --> 01:13:19.026
You don't
understand.

01:13:19.028 --> 01:13:20.561
Chocoholic.

01:13:20.563 --> 01:13:21.562
Sashay around.

01:13:21.564 --> 01:13:22.563
Chocoholic!

01:13:22.565 --> 01:13:23.698
Sashay around.

01:13:23.700 --> 01:13:26.567
What's the name
of that 6 horse?

01:13:26.569 --> 01:13:29.570
Sinking? No, that's
the name of the jockey...

01:13:29.572 --> 01:13:31.572
something about
the sound diamonds,

01:13:31.574 --> 01:13:33.908
I don't know what it is...

01:14:11.013 --> 01:14:12.213
That's the guy.

01:14:12.215 --> 01:14:13.614
Yes.

01:14:16.552 --> 01:14:17.852
Stay.

01:14:55.657 --> 01:14:57.058
Guess who.

01:14:57.060 --> 01:14:59.160
A football salesman.

01:14:59.162 --> 01:15:01.662
No, it's me.

01:15:01.664 --> 01:15:02.797
It's Vicki.

01:15:02.799 --> 01:15:03.998
Hi, Vicki.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.066
Hi, Trotter.

01:15:05.068 --> 01:15:06.567
What are you
doing here?

01:15:06.569 --> 01:15:10.004
Nothing. What are you
going to do, Trotter?

01:15:10.006 --> 01:15:12.773
I don't know.

01:15:12.775 --> 01:15:14.008
Where's your friend?

01:15:14.010 --> 01:15:15.743
Who, Bernie?

01:15:15.745 --> 01:15:18.813
You know, you can
do better than that.

01:15:18.815 --> 01:15:21.782
A girl's got to decide
what's important--

01:15:21.784 --> 01:15:23.651
Money or love.

01:15:23.653 --> 01:15:25.686
No one's giving
anything away.

01:15:25.688 --> 01:15:27.522
Bernie has
a lot of money,

01:15:27.524 --> 01:15:29.891
which can
come in handy sometimes.

01:15:29.893 --> 01:15:31.158
You're a wonderful girl.

01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:33.661
Thank you, Trotter.

01:15:35.631 --> 01:15:38.866
I'm getting
a little nervous now.

01:15:38.868 --> 01:15:41.569
I was just thinking
I'd come down

01:15:41.571 --> 01:15:43.704
and ask you
to go to bed with me

01:15:43.706 --> 01:15:47.875
'cause I think
you're kind of funny.

01:15:47.877 --> 01:15:50.645
Am I having
a good day or what?

01:15:50.647 --> 01:15:51.679
Vicki.

01:15:51.681 --> 01:15:52.713
What?

01:15:52.715 --> 01:15:53.781
Thank you.

01:15:53.783 --> 01:15:55.016
You're welcome.

01:15:55.018 --> 01:15:58.252
From the bottom
of my heart,
thank you.

01:15:58.254 --> 01:16:01.322
But I'm in love
with my wife.

01:16:01.324 --> 01:16:03.824
Oh...

01:16:03.826 --> 01:16:05.126
well...

01:16:05.128 --> 01:16:07.662
I just thought
I'd ask, that's all.

01:16:07.664 --> 01:16:09.664
What is it they say?

01:16:09.666 --> 01:16:13.568
"Nothing ventured,
nothing...ventured."

01:16:23.345 --> 01:16:25.980
Ah, here's Trotter.

01:16:25.982 --> 01:16:27.815
Hi.

01:16:27.817 --> 01:16:29.750
What are you
going to do?

01:16:29.752 --> 01:16:31.919
I know what he's
not going to do.

01:16:34.089 --> 01:16:36.157
What are you
going to do?

01:16:36.159 --> 01:16:37.258
I don't know.

01:16:37.260 --> 01:16:38.893
Are you betting
on this race?

01:16:40.028 --> 01:16:41.862
I don't know.

01:16:47.035 --> 01:16:48.803
Whatever you do,

01:16:48.805 --> 01:16:49.870
don't bet on that horse.

01:16:49.872 --> 01:16:51.606
Why not?

01:16:51.608 --> 01:16:53.374
Something's wrong
with its eyes.

01:16:53.376 --> 01:16:56.644
How can they race
a horse like that?

01:17:22.004 --> 01:17:24.238
Let me
get this straight.

01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:28.109
Whatever I do,
don't bet this horse.

01:17:32.648 --> 01:17:34.682
Looney, Vicki.
Vicki, Looney.

01:17:34.684 --> 01:17:36.150
Nice to meet you.

01:17:44.059 --> 01:17:45.660
I may faint.

01:17:45.662 --> 01:17:46.961
Don't worry.

01:17:46.963 --> 01:17:49.196
We got full
medical coverage.

01:17:49.198 --> 01:17:50.731
I'll be OK.

01:17:54.136 --> 01:17:56.837
Let it ride.

01:17:56.839 --> 01:17:59.440
Is it all there?

01:17:59.442 --> 01:18:01.676
I spent some
on the little woman,

01:18:01.678 --> 01:18:04.145
but it's all there.

01:18:04.147 --> 01:18:05.413
There are all kinds
of balls.

01:18:05.415 --> 01:18:06.881
One of his
is crystal.

01:18:12.087 --> 01:18:15.156
I--I can't give you
$50 win tickets.

01:18:15.158 --> 01:18:16.724
That's over 1,300
win tickets.

01:18:16.726 --> 01:18:18.159
It'll jam the machine.

01:18:18.161 --> 01:18:19.960
We'll be here
till Christmas.

01:18:23.031 --> 01:18:24.932
The counting room.

01:18:41.450 --> 01:18:44.318
Right. Now, I'll
issue you a receipt

01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:45.953
to the value
of your wager,

01:18:45.955 --> 01:18:47.455
which is $68,000,

01:18:47.457 --> 01:18:49.457
on the number
2 horse,

01:18:49.459 --> 01:18:51.892
which is called...
Hot-to-Trot.

01:18:51.894 --> 01:18:53.327
Should you lose
this receipt--

01:18:53.329 --> 01:18:55.463
He's not going
to lose his receipt.

01:18:55.465 --> 01:18:58.065
Right. Your bet will
immediately be routed

01:18:58.067 --> 01:18:59.467
through the computer

01:18:59.469 --> 01:19:01.469
that adjusts the odds
on the tote board.

01:19:01.471 --> 01:19:03.471
Hot-to-Trot's sitting
at 40-to-1, but...

01:19:03.473 --> 01:19:06.073
a wager this size
will knock it down

01:19:06.075 --> 01:19:08.876
to...maybe 8-to-1.

01:19:08.878 --> 01:19:11.312
I must say,
you're very calm.

01:19:11.314 --> 01:19:13.214
Most guys come in here,

01:19:13.216 --> 01:19:16.050
they're ready to gnaw
the legs off the tables.

01:19:16.052 --> 01:19:18.452
Well, that's 'cause
I'm going to win.

01:19:18.454 --> 01:19:20.254
You're a wonderful guy.

01:19:21.456 --> 01:19:23.257
What a guy.

01:19:28.964 --> 01:19:30.898
Some coke dealer
went nuts again.

01:19:30.900 --> 01:19:32.266
Heavy bettor.
Make room.

01:19:32.268 --> 01:19:34.769
Heavy bettor.
Heavy--hey!

01:19:37.305 --> 01:19:39.440
Who do you like,
Evangeline?

01:19:39.442 --> 01:19:43.277
I am going to bet
all 200 of my dollars

01:19:43.279 --> 01:19:45.479
on the 4 horse,
Stargazer, to show.

01:19:45.481 --> 01:19:46.814
Of course
I  <i>could</i> lose.

01:19:46.816 --> 01:19:47.848
Stay calm.

01:19:47.850 --> 01:19:49.350
What if I lost?

01:19:49.352 --> 01:19:52.987
OK, OK.
Come on, Trotter.
It doesn't matter.

01:19:52.989 --> 01:19:55.422
I had a lobster,
some drinks,

01:19:55.424 --> 01:19:57.391
bought my wife
a diamond necklace.

01:19:57.393 --> 01:19:59.026
I'm OK. I'm OK.

01:19:59.028 --> 01:20:00.494
I settled
Looney's tab,

01:20:00.496 --> 01:20:03.497
made a few friends
like you and Vicki,

01:20:03.499 --> 01:20:05.099
the ticket seller--

01:20:05.101 --> 01:20:09.003
Can't put
a price tag
on a day like that.

01:20:09.005 --> 01:20:11.272
Got some money
for a ride home

01:20:11.274 --> 01:20:14.208
and dinner out
somewhere if I lose.

01:20:14.210 --> 01:20:17.845
But if I win,
Reardon, if I win...

01:20:23.852 --> 01:20:27.121
Trotter, I was getting
worried about you.

01:20:27.123 --> 01:20:29.156
I bet 20
on the favorite.

01:20:32.093 --> 01:20:35.462
I put every penny
on the number 2 horse,

01:20:35.464 --> 01:20:37.464
Hot-to-Trot.

01:20:37.466 --> 01:20:40.334
When the odds
went 8-1, I knew it.

01:20:40.336 --> 01:20:42.269
He pissed it
all away!

01:20:42.271 --> 01:20:44.405
Yay!
Yay!

01:20:54.082 --> 01:20:56.083
May the best horse win.

01:20:56.085 --> 01:20:57.318
The 2 horse!

01:21:02.490 --> 01:21:04.959
The 2 horse was limping

01:21:04.961 --> 01:21:06.093
coming out
of the gate!

01:21:06.095 --> 01:21:08.262
Shut up, you
pessimistic jinx!

01:21:08.264 --> 01:21:10.064
I can't see!
I'm going blind!

01:21:12.634 --> 01:21:14.935
Run, you
son of a bitch!

01:21:14.937 --> 01:21:16.604
Come on, Hot-to-Trot!

01:21:19.441 --> 01:21:21.408
Please,
I swear I'll stop!

01:21:21.410 --> 01:21:23.377
I always swear to God
I'll quit smoking.

01:21:23.379 --> 01:21:24.511
I don't think so.

01:21:24.513 --> 01:21:26.380
I bet you swore
something secretly.

01:21:26.382 --> 01:21:29.316
Who do you think
you are, Jimmy Swaggart?

01:21:29.318 --> 01:21:31.318
This is a horse race!

01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:33.053
It doesn't work
that way!

01:21:33.055 --> 01:21:34.288
If my horse loses,

01:21:34.290 --> 01:21:36.223
I'll wring
your chicken neck!

01:21:39.027 --> 01:21:40.261
I can't see
the 2 horse!

01:21:46.568 --> 01:21:48.102
What do you see?

01:21:48.104 --> 01:21:49.136
Come on!

01:21:49.138 --> 01:21:51.138
Your horse
is on the outside.

01:21:51.140 --> 01:21:52.339
Stay on the track!

01:21:52.341 --> 01:21:54.174
The horse
can't hear you!

01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:00.614
Come on, Stargazer,
move it!

01:22:00.616 --> 01:22:01.949
Move it!

01:22:01.951 --> 01:22:03.317
Just make her lose.

01:22:03.319 --> 01:22:05.219
I'll give up
my smut collection.

01:22:09.457 --> 01:22:12.159
Hey, there's two horses
pulling away.

01:22:12.161 --> 01:22:13.494
One of them's yours.

01:22:13.496 --> 01:22:16.497
More ground to cover.

01:22:18.566 --> 01:22:20.935
I'll leave Bernie.

01:22:20.937 --> 01:22:22.670
Pure love
from now on.

01:22:22.672 --> 01:22:25.539
I'll go for some poor guy
with nothing.

01:22:29.678 --> 01:22:31.245
Let him have it.

01:22:31.247 --> 01:22:33.480
I don't care
about the lousy 200.

01:22:33.482 --> 01:22:34.682
Marry me?

01:22:43.325 --> 01:22:44.558
Come on, now!

01:22:47.729 --> 01:22:49.229
Aah!

01:22:56.237 --> 01:22:57.604
Whoa. They're
pecker to pecker.

01:22:57.606 --> 01:22:59.073
Who?

01:22:59.075 --> 01:23:00.441
<i>It's Stargazer</i>
<i>on the inside...</i>

01:23:00.443 --> 01:23:03.210
Come on, 2! Please!

01:23:05.246 --> 01:23:08.082
You can't shine
a flashlight between them!

01:23:08.084 --> 01:23:10.718
<i>It's Stargazer</i>
<i>on the outside...</i>

01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:12.252
I'm getting something.

01:23:12.254 --> 01:23:14.288
Lord, give that punk
a break.

01:23:14.290 --> 01:23:17.057
It's the 2.
It's the 2. Come on, 2!

01:23:19.461 --> 01:23:20.494
2!

01:23:20.496 --> 01:23:21.628
2, 2!

01:23:21.630 --> 01:23:22.730
You can do it!

01:23:22.732 --> 01:23:24.565
Yes. Yes.

01:23:35.310 --> 01:23:37.044
I got it.

01:23:57.432 --> 01:24:00.367
<i>Stargazer just in front,</i>

01:24:00.369 --> 01:24:03.737
<i>but Hot-to-Trot's</i>
<i>coming in on the outside.</i>

01:24:03.739 --> 01:24:06.573
<i>Hot-to-Trot</i>
<i>or Stargazer.</i>

01:24:06.575 --> 01:24:10.077
<i>And at the wire it's...</i>
<i>My God.</i>

01:24:11.179 --> 01:24:12.813
Were did My God
come from?

01:24:12.815 --> 01:24:16.517
Oh, man,
I'm glad I'm poor

01:24:16.519 --> 01:24:19.119
and don't have to worry
about finishes like that!

01:24:19.121 --> 01:24:21.255
I knew it.

01:24:21.257 --> 01:24:22.623
I knew it.

01:24:22.625 --> 01:24:25.125
What the hell
did he know?

01:24:25.127 --> 01:24:26.627
<i>We</i> knew <i>it.</i>

01:24:26.629 --> 01:24:29.163
Wouldn't it be hell
if that horse
got disqualified

01:24:29.165 --> 01:24:31.465
for bumping
or something?

01:24:35.136 --> 01:24:38.138
I knew it.

01:24:38.140 --> 01:24:39.339
Pardon me.

01:24:41.142 --> 01:24:43.243
Sorry. Excuse me.

01:24:49.150 --> 01:24:50.417
Thank you, sweetheart.

01:24:50.419 --> 01:24:52.786
That was really
very sweet, honey.

01:24:52.788 --> 01:24:53.854
And this.

01:24:53.856 --> 01:24:55.389
Ah.

01:24:58.660 --> 01:25:01.195
I bet it all, honey.

01:25:01.197 --> 01:25:03.130
I let it all ride.

01:25:03.132 --> 01:25:04.665
It's only money.

01:25:06.367 --> 01:25:09.236
Let the guy have it,
will you?

01:25:09.238 --> 01:25:11.171
He's a sweet
little fellow.
