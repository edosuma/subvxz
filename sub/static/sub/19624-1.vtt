Welcome to "The Voice"

00:01.885 --> 00:03.393
 Turn it up 
Welcome to "The Voice"
Season 12, everybody!

00:03.393 --> 00:05.490
Welcome to "The Voice"
Season 12, everybody!

00:06.590 --> 00:08.390
♪ I can make your hands clap ♪

00:08.390 --> 00:09.890
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

00:09.890 --> 00:11.790
♪ Said I can make
your hands clap ♪
You got four!

00:11.790 --> 00:13.160
Whoo!

00:13.160 --> 00:15.300
♪ Said I can make
your hands clap ♪
No hugging!

00:15.300 --> 00:17.730
Daly: Taking our coaches'
chairs this season,

00:17.730 --> 00:19.500
together for the first time...

00:19.500 --> 00:22.440
Grammy Award-winning music
and style icon,

00:22.440 --> 00:25.340
fresh off her latest
number-one album, Gwen Stefani.

00:25.340 --> 00:27.280
Gwen: I've had
the last two seasons off.

00:27.280 --> 00:29.950
Made an album,
toured the United States,

00:29.950 --> 00:33.850
so I feel ready to come back
here now, super inspired.

00:33.850 --> 00:35.880
You can only sing like that
if you've lived it.

00:35.880 --> 00:38.090
Right now, I feel like
I'm here to work with you.

00:38.090 --> 00:39.920
Yes! Oh, my God!
 I can make your hands clap 

00:39.960 --> 00:42.920
I'm real excited
to take home my first win.

00:42.960 --> 00:45.690
Daly: Grammy Award-winning
front man for Maroon 5

00:45.690 --> 00:48.130
with over
20 million albums sold,

00:48.130 --> 00:51.030
three-time "Voice" champion
Adam Levine.

00:51.030 --> 00:53.040
Adam: Being able to
alter someone's course,

00:53.040 --> 00:54.900
it's a really cool
responsibility.

00:54.900 --> 00:56.540
I think that
you can win "The Voice,"

00:56.540 --> 00:59.610
and I would love nothing more
than to help you get to the top.

00:59.610 --> 01:01.980
You can win this thing,
and it would be a shame

01:01.980 --> 01:04.180
to see somebody screw that up
for you like Adam.

01:04.180 --> 01:06.120
[Laughter]

01:06.120 --> 01:09.820
This season, it's a new
combination of coaches.

01:09.820 --> 01:11.090
Everyone's a threat,

01:11.090 --> 01:13.590
but no one's got stamina like me
to win "The Voice."

01:13.590 --> 01:15.790
Daly: 15-time
Grammy Award-winning singer,

01:15.790 --> 01:18.590
songwriter, and producer,
with 31 million albums

01:18.590 --> 01:22.000
sold worldwide and five
number-one albums, Alicia Keys.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.770
Alicia:
Feels really good to be back.

01:23.770 --> 01:27.240
My inner competitive nature
is alive and well.

01:27.240 --> 01:33.780
 Pick me as your coach 

01:33.780 --> 01:36.340
My strategy is to be in my heart
and not in my head.

01:36.340 --> 01:39.650
When you stay in your heart,
you find the magic.

01:39.650 --> 01:42.050
Daly:
And country music superstar

01:42.050 --> 01:46.120
with over 10 million albums sold
and 23 number-one hits,

01:46.150 --> 01:49.990
last season's winning coach,
Blake Shelton.

01:49.990 --> 01:51.560
Sundance Head, Team Blake!

01:51.560 --> 01:54.500
Blake: Just one push of that red
button can change their lives.

01:54.500 --> 01:55.860
What the hell?!

01:55.860 --> 01:56.930
Just look at Sundance.

01:56.930 --> 01:59.000
He's already
out on tour with me.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.570
But now that I've won this show
five times,

02:01.570 --> 02:03.770
it has the other coaches
ganging up on me.

02:03.770 --> 02:05.110
Clearly three against one.

02:05.110 --> 02:07.380
Who are you gonna pick?
I hope it's not Blake.

02:07.380 --> 02:09.410
My job on this show
is to try and win,

02:09.410 --> 02:11.750
even when my competition
is my girlfriend,

02:11.750 --> 02:13.580
and I'm not talking about Adam.

02:14.750 --> 02:15.720
Is that me?

02:15.720 --> 02:16.790
[Laughter]

02:16.790 --> 02:18.020
Give him a kiss.

02:19.650 --> 02:20.790
I'm 13.

02:20.790 --> 02:22.690
- What?!
- What?!

02:22.690 --> 02:23.660
That's crazy.

02:23.660 --> 02:25.360
We've never
had someone 13.

02:26.830 --> 02:28.730
There's a new dynamic
with these two.

02:28.730 --> 02:30.330
They're, like, dating.
[Record needle scratches]

02:30.330 --> 02:32.600
People watching haven't
seen you guys together.

02:32.600 --> 02:34.370
'Cause the last time
you were coaches,

02:34.370 --> 02:35.640
things were much different.
Yeah.

02:35.640 --> 02:37.210
Can we talk about
the elephant in the room?

02:37.210 --> 02:40.040
Hey, guys,
you have any creamer?

02:40.040 --> 02:41.340
Oh.

02:41.340 --> 02:42.910
 So can I get a hand clap? 

02:42.910 --> 02:45.650
Daly: Season 12 of "The Voice"
starts right now.

02:50.290 --> 02:52.520
[Cheers and applause]

02:52.550 --> 02:53.920
Happy you're back.

02:53.960 --> 02:56.420
I'm so happy.

02:56.460 --> 02:58.760
Wow, it's happening
to me again.

02:58.760 --> 03:01.530
I can't believe
it's happening again.

03:01.530 --> 03:04.100
Woman: Gwen!

03:04.100 --> 03:05.400
Wow.

03:05.400 --> 03:08.900
Daly: Let's meet
the first artist of the season.

03:08.900 --> 03:10.940
I'm Joshua Hunter,
29 years old.

03:10.940 --> 03:12.510
I'm from Albany, Georgia.

03:12.510 --> 03:14.180
My stage name is J. Chosen

03:14.180 --> 03:17.250
because I felt like
I was chosen to do music.

03:17.250 --> 03:18.550
I always could sing,

03:18.550 --> 03:21.380
and in high school,
I played the tuba in the band,

03:21.380 --> 03:26.020
but I am 6'6", so growing up,
all I played was basketball.

03:27.490 --> 03:29.990
After high school,
I received the full scholarship

03:29.990 --> 03:31.960
to Appalachian State University.

03:31.960 --> 03:34.460
I definitely wanted
to be in the NBA.

03:34.460 --> 03:36.460
But I shattered my knee.

03:36.460 --> 03:38.730
That's when I had
to think to myself,

03:38.730 --> 03:41.240
"I have a bigger passion,
and that is music."

03:41.240 --> 03:46.140
I started to go to open mics
and record.

03:46.140 --> 03:49.540
In Atlanta, it's very hard
to make a living as a musician.

03:49.540 --> 03:51.210
So I'm a paraprofessional,

03:51.210 --> 03:52.880
and I work with
special-need kids.

03:52.880 --> 03:54.420
I want
to talk to Mommy.

03:54.420 --> 03:55.520
You want to call Mommy?

03:55.520 --> 03:57.790
Yes.
Show me five cents first.

03:57.790 --> 03:59.990
What drew me was
the need to teach.

03:59.990 --> 04:01.990
Just to see their smile
every day drives me here

04:01.990 --> 04:03.290
to come and work with them.

04:03.290 --> 04:05.560
Good job.

04:05.560 --> 04:06.800
This job is wonderful,

04:06.800 --> 04:10.000
and it helps me
provide for my son.

04:12.170 --> 04:14.540
My son's mother,
she lives back in Albany,

04:14.540 --> 04:15.570
three hours away from me.

04:15.570 --> 04:16.640
Come on.

04:16.640 --> 04:20.040
When he was born,
that changed my life.

04:20.040 --> 04:22.580
Because now I have
someone looking up to me,

04:22.580 --> 04:24.080
I have more to work for.

04:25.780 --> 04:27.120
It's emotional for me

04:27.120 --> 04:30.820
because I didn't have
that same love from my father.

04:30.820 --> 04:33.120
His father and I,
when we broke up,

04:33.150 --> 04:37.060
I made sure that I put him
in only the things

04:37.060 --> 04:40.300
that would develop character
in him,

04:40.300 --> 04:43.030
and music saved Josh.

04:43.030 --> 04:44.770
Joshua: For my blind audition,

04:44.770 --> 04:47.370
I'll be singing "Sexual Healing"
by Marvin Gaye.

04:47.370 --> 04:49.840
It's the perfect song
for me to showcase my talent

04:49.840 --> 04:53.880
in front of four of the best
artists, producers, songwriters

04:53.880 --> 04:55.140
in the world.

04:55.140 --> 04:58.410
To turn a chair,
all the blood, sweat, and tears

04:58.410 --> 05:00.280
would be worth it.

05:01.880 --> 05:03.490
Ooh!

05:03.490 --> 05:05.920
Okay, get serious.
Try to get serious.

05:07.000 --> 05:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:14.000 --> 05:17.100
 Ooh 

05:17.100 --> 05:19.470
 Baby 

05:19.470 --> 05:20.400
Whoa.

05:20.400 --> 05:24.910
 I'm hot just like an oven 

05:24.910 --> 05:28.480
 And I need some lovin' 

05:28.480 --> 05:31.250
 Ohh, ohh 

05:33.180 --> 05:35.480
 When I get that feelin' 

05:35.480 --> 05:38.220
 I want sexual healing 

05:38.250 --> 05:41.790
 Sexual healing 

05:41.790 --> 05:43.760
 Oh, baby 

05:43.760 --> 05:48.730
 Makes me feel so fine 

05:48.730 --> 05:53.340
 Helps to relieve my mind 

05:53.340 --> 05:56.970
 Sexual healing 

05:56.970 --> 05:58.440
 Is good for me 

05:58.440 --> 06:00.880
 Sexual healing 

06:00.880 --> 06:03.980
 Is something
that's good for me 

06:03.980 --> 06:08.850
 Whenever blue teardrops
are falling 

06:08.850 --> 06:14.190
 And my emotional stability
is leaving me 

06:14.190 --> 06:17.660
 There is something
I could do 

06:17.660 --> 06:23.530
 I could get on the telephone
and call you up, baby 

06:23.530 --> 06:26.740
 And you're my medicine 

06:26.740 --> 06:29.240
 Open up and let me in 

06:29.240 --> 06:31.170
 Darling, you're so great 

06:31.170 --> 06:34.310
 I can't wait
for you to operate 

06:34.310 --> 06:39.080
 Baby, yeah 

06:39.080 --> 06:41.550
 When I get that feeling 

06:41.550 --> 06:45.090
 Sexual, sexual, sexual 

06:45.090 --> 06:46.020
[Laughs]

06:46.020 --> 06:47.690
 Healing 

06:47.690 --> 06:49.220
 Is good for me 

06:49.260 --> 06:51.460
 Sexual healing 

06:51.460 --> 06:55.960
 Is something
that's good for me 

06:55.960 --> 06:58.970
[Cheers and applause]

07:08.880 --> 07:10.850
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

07:10.850 --> 07:12.010
Just thank you.

07:12.010 --> 07:14.550
I'm not really feeling
too confident right now.

07:14.550 --> 07:16.750
It don't matter.
You never know.

07:16.750 --> 07:17.820
[Cheers and applause]

07:17.850 --> 07:20.320
Whoo!

07:22.690 --> 07:24.460
Four chairs.
What do you feel like?

07:24.460 --> 07:25.560
It's a dream come true.

07:25.560 --> 07:27.230
Listen, man,
we got a lot of work to do,

07:27.230 --> 07:28.400
so let's get started.

07:28.400 --> 07:31.130
[Laughter]
What happened?

07:31.130 --> 07:33.900
He just healed us sexually.
That's what just happened.

07:33.900 --> 07:35.700
- Whoa.
- What's your name?

07:35.700 --> 07:38.340
My name is J. Chosen.
I'm 29 years old.

07:38.340 --> 07:40.710
I'm a little country boy
from Albany, Georgia.

07:40.710 --> 07:43.240
I'm a teacher.
I work with special-need kids.

07:43.240 --> 07:44.750
To do this in front of...

07:44.750 --> 07:46.850
[Cheers and applause]
...four great coaches...

07:46.850 --> 07:49.050
I'm still, like,
in awe right now.

07:49.050 --> 07:51.920
J., if for some reason,
there's nothing I can

07:51.920 --> 07:54.390
unlock inside of you
to realize that I'm your man,

07:54.390 --> 07:56.190
I won't be able
to sleep tonight.

07:56.190 --> 07:58.590
Because I know how
to win this show,

07:58.590 --> 08:02.230
and I know for a fact,
I can win it with you.

08:02.230 --> 08:03.770
And I just know
that you're the dude

08:03.770 --> 08:05.330
that's gonna do it for me.

08:05.330 --> 08:08.370
Thank you, thank you.
I know it. I know it.

08:08.370 --> 08:09.970
I know it!

08:09.970 --> 08:10.970
[Laughter]

08:10.970 --> 08:12.670
Geez.

08:12.670 --> 08:15.180
You could be with somebody
violent like that.

08:15.180 --> 08:17.280
Uh, it's called
passion.

08:17.280 --> 08:18.380
I Googled it.

08:18.380 --> 08:19.850
[Laughter]

08:19.850 --> 08:21.620
- It is passion.
- Whoo!

08:21.620 --> 08:23.690
Listen.
[Grunts]

08:23.690 --> 08:25.920
Every note
is pitch-perfect.

08:25.950 --> 08:27.290
Your tone is incredible.

08:27.290 --> 08:29.220
And you had Alicia like...
She was embarrassed.

08:29.260 --> 08:30.630
She was hiding
from her own emotions.

08:30.660 --> 08:31.630
I was.

08:31.660 --> 08:32.860
You even had
the Marvin growl.

08:32.860 --> 08:34.000
Like, no one can do that.
Wow.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.559
And the possibilities
are endless.

08:35.559 --> 08:36.970
- Thank you.
- Adam.

08:36.970 --> 08:39.070
Can J. talk to his coach
for a minute?

08:39.070 --> 08:40.840
- Wow.
- She's not your coach yet.

08:40.840 --> 08:42.500
Who are you?

08:42.500 --> 08:43.570
[Laughs]

08:43.570 --> 08:45.670
Marvin Gaye
is in heaven like...

08:45.670 --> 08:46.940
[Applause]

08:46.940 --> 08:48.910
- Yeah, exactly.
- You know what I'm saying?

08:48.910 --> 08:52.510
Because it was so powerful
and so crazy-emotional.

08:52.510 --> 08:55.320
People do not sing like this.

08:55.320 --> 08:58.020
It is really a blessing
to be in your presence

08:58.050 --> 08:59.790
'cause I don't think
we get an opportunity

08:59.790 --> 09:02.820
to see this beautiful
vulnerability from men, too.

09:02.860 --> 09:05.260
So, I think this is
really important for the show,

09:05.260 --> 09:08.230
really important
for your coach, Alicia.

09:08.230 --> 09:09.360
[Laughter]

09:09.360 --> 09:12.630
Potential coach.
And congratulations, J.

09:12.630 --> 09:14.700
It's really a blessing.
Thank you so much.

09:14.700 --> 09:16.140
[Cheers and applause]

09:16.140 --> 09:20.040
It's so hard for one not to be
completely mesmerized

09:20.040 --> 09:21.940
when Alicia Keys,
she's staring you in the eye.

09:21.940 --> 09:23.140
She's amazing.

09:23.140 --> 09:26.410
Obviously, what I heard
was just so instinctual.

09:26.410 --> 09:28.280
It was, like, true talent.

09:28.280 --> 09:30.520
The way you smiled
when you were singing that song,

09:30.520 --> 09:33.020
you just seemed, like,
really present in the moment

09:33.050 --> 09:34.690
and grateful to be here.

09:34.690 --> 09:37.130
And I recognize
that you give of yourself

09:37.160 --> 09:39.590
working with children
with special needs.

09:39.590 --> 09:42.400
And, you know, I've done so many
different kinds of things.

09:42.400 --> 09:45.500
I've bounced around
into different kinds
of genres of music,

09:45.500 --> 09:48.840
traveled the whole planet
touching people with my story,

09:48.840 --> 09:52.210
and then receiving that love
back and healing through music.

09:52.210 --> 09:55.540
Music is... It's just
such an unbelievable gift

09:55.540 --> 09:57.150
that you shared with us today.

09:57.150 --> 09:58.980
And not just your voice,
but your heart.

09:58.980 --> 10:01.480
Like, your heart just comes
right out in that smile.

10:01.480 --> 10:03.590
Whoever you choose,
I'm excited for you.

10:03.590 --> 10:06.590
This is an amazing show,
and I'd love to work with you.

10:06.590 --> 10:08.990
[Cheers and applause]
Thank you, thank you.

10:08.990 --> 10:10.690
Adam: Let me just
tell you something.

10:10.690 --> 10:13.760
For some reason, th-the guys
on this panel never do this,

10:13.760 --> 10:15.200
but the connection
and the brotherhood

10:15.200 --> 10:16.630
that we can have,
and the thing...

10:16.630 --> 10:18.430
[Laughs] Yeah.
Hey.

10:18.430 --> 10:19.830
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.

10:19.830 --> 10:21.200
Having someone
that understands

10:21.200 --> 10:22.940
what you're gonna be
going through as a man.

10:22.940 --> 10:24.810
Blake and I have navigated
through our careers,

10:24.810 --> 10:26.470
and it's... Oh, they're
all so different.

10:26.470 --> 10:28.810
I mean, I couldn't be more
different than Blake Shelton.

10:28.810 --> 10:30.180
Thank God.

10:30.180 --> 10:32.210
Honestly, I have to butt in
just a little bit

10:32.210 --> 10:34.820
because if you choose me,
you get to have

10:34.820 --> 10:38.420
the female perspective, right,
and the male perspective

10:38.450 --> 10:40.320
because I've been
in a band with all men.

10:40.360 --> 10:41.820
I got to live in both worlds.

10:41.860 --> 10:43.730
I've written songs about it,
and...

10:43.760 --> 10:45.260
So I don't feel uncomfortable.

10:45.260 --> 10:48.660
I feel confident that I could
relate to you in so many ways.

10:48.660 --> 10:49.800
I mean...

10:49.800 --> 10:51.000
Yes, Adam?

10:51.000 --> 10:52.130
[Laughter]

10:52.130 --> 10:53.470
Can I talk now?
Yeah.

10:53.470 --> 10:54.470
Thanks. Um...

10:54.470 --> 10:55.540
Anyways, so...

10:55.540 --> 10:58.270
[Laughter]

10:58.270 --> 11:01.410
Make sure that you go
with someone who is

11:01.410 --> 11:04.550
the most passionate
about you and what you do.

11:04.550 --> 11:06.480
I hit my button
because I'm a fan.

11:06.480 --> 11:09.320
I instantly was into
what you're doing.

11:09.320 --> 11:11.090
We've both been here
since the beginning.

11:11.090 --> 11:14.390
There's so many similarities
between he and I as coaches

11:14.390 --> 11:18.230
except... I have won the show
more than him.

11:18.260 --> 11:19.430
[Laughter]

11:19.460 --> 11:20.460
J., it's time.

11:20.460 --> 11:21.860
Who do you pick
as your coach?

11:21.860 --> 11:24.070
[Audience shouting]

11:24.070 --> 11:25.200
J.

11:25.200 --> 11:26.970
He's in the middle
of praying right now.

11:26.970 --> 11:29.400
- J.
- We're all praying right now.

11:29.400 --> 11:31.510
[Laughs]

11:31.510 --> 11:34.510
[Shouting continues]

11:34.510 --> 11:35.810
Oh, my God.

11:37.150 --> 11:38.280
Come on, J.!

11:38.280 --> 11:40.350
I pick...

11:40.350 --> 11:42.320
Gwen.

11:42.320 --> 11:44.220
 What's going on? 
What are you talking about?!

11:44.220 --> 11:45.790
 What's going on? 

11:45.790 --> 11:47.390
 Tell me what's going on 
Are you serious?!

11:47.390 --> 11:48.990
 I'll tell you
what's going on 
Are you serious?

11:48.990 --> 11:51.090
Oh, my God!
Really?

11:51.090 --> 11:53.360
Are you serious?

11:53.360 --> 11:54.800
Yes.

11:54.800 --> 11:56.700
Oh, my God.
I'm so excited.

11:56.700 --> 11:57.730
I can't believe it.

11:57.730 --> 11:58.970
I'm so excited to work
with you.

11:58.970 --> 12:00.000
Wow.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.270
I want to work with someone

12:01.270 --> 12:03.600
that I knew would give me
that diversity.

12:03.600 --> 12:05.710
Different tones
and different melodies.
What is happening?!

12:05.710 --> 12:07.540
And I'm so excited
to work with her.

12:07.540 --> 12:10.850
I never in my wildest,
wildest dreams

12:10.850 --> 12:12.180
thought he would choose me.

12:12.180 --> 12:13.750
That was awesome!

12:13.750 --> 12:16.480
Oh, wait.
J.! J., J.!

12:16.480 --> 12:18.590
Being back,
I feel super inspired.

12:18.590 --> 12:21.520
It never ceases to amaze me
how many talented singers

12:21.560 --> 12:24.530
there are, and having
a strong R&B soul singer

12:24.560 --> 12:26.690
on my team is incredible.

12:26.690 --> 12:28.260
I feel a little bit nervous
about it,

12:28.260 --> 12:32.330
but I also feel confident
that it's meant to be.

12:32.330 --> 12:33.600
I'm in shock!

12:33.600 --> 12:35.200
 What's going on? 

12:35.200 --> 12:37.110
Adam: Gwen's crushing it.
J. is awesome.

12:37.110 --> 12:38.340
That one really hurt.

12:38.340 --> 12:41.180
 What's going on? 
Four chairs? Oh, my God.

12:41.180 --> 12:44.080
My little boy gonna be so happy.
[Laughs]

12:44.080 --> 12:45.980
- I was not expecting that.
- I can't believe it.

12:45.980 --> 12:47.080
I thought I had him.

12:47.080 --> 12:48.650
That was awesome.
I loved that.

12:48.650 --> 12:50.180
Daly: Coming up...

12:50.180 --> 12:52.320
 Try a little tenderness 
Daly: ...Season 12 excitement

12:52.350 --> 12:53.420
is just getting started.

12:53.420 --> 12:54.420
Oh, my God.

12:54.460 --> 12:55.490
Yee-haw!

12:55.490 --> 12:57.330
Ahhh!

12:57.360 --> 12:59.430
You make Blake look like
he's not that country.

12:59.460 --> 13:01.530
- Yeah.
- You are exposing me right now.

13:01.530 --> 13:03.870
- This is on.
- He gonna whup your ass.

13:03.870 --> 13:05.430
- [Laughs]
- What is wrong with you?

13:05.430 --> 13:06.930
Time out!

13:06.930 --> 13:08.670
Whoo, child!

13:08.670 --> 13:12.540
Daly: And later, one artist gets
the opportunity of a lifetime.

13:12.540 --> 13:18.850
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 

13:21.490 --> 13:23.620
 This is "The Voice" 

13:24.760 --> 13:26.460
Daly: Welcome back
to the blind auditions

13:26.460 --> 13:28.390
at Universal Studios Hollywood.

13:28.390 --> 13:31.030
- Gwen is back!
- Hey!

13:31.030 --> 13:33.300
This is so incredible
right here.

13:33.300 --> 13:34.770
This is another level.

13:34.770 --> 13:36.230
- I'm pumped.
- I know.

13:36.230 --> 13:38.040
It's only him
I don't like.

13:38.040 --> 13:40.140
I like him so much that
I'll make up for you not...

13:40.140 --> 13:41.240
That'll make up
for my dislike.

13:41.240 --> 13:42.240
Yeah.
That's perfect.

13:42.240 --> 13:43.780
This is great.
Isn't that weird,

13:43.780 --> 13:46.240
that you guys are, like,
together, and like, on the show?

13:46.240 --> 13:47.650
It's crazy.
Whoa. Are you serious right now?

13:47.650 --> 13:49.380
So you can go back
to not mattering.

13:49.380 --> 13:50.850
[Laughs]

13:50.850 --> 13:53.050
You only tear people down when
you have an insecurity issue.

13:53.050 --> 13:55.090
It's okay, baby.
Oh.

13:55.090 --> 13:56.490
In your face, bro.

13:56.490 --> 13:58.520
How's that feel?
I feel like a better
person all of a sudden.

13:58.560 --> 14:00.530
Daly:
While our coaches get ready,

14:00.560 --> 14:02.390
let's meet the next artist.

14:02.390 --> 14:03.630
Lauren: My name is Lauren Duski.

14:03.660 --> 14:06.200
I'm 25 years old,
and I'm from Gaylord, Michigan.

14:06.200 --> 14:08.630
I come from
a family of dentists.

14:08.630 --> 14:12.070
Other than me, there's really
no one in my family who sings.

14:12.070 --> 14:13.570
Not even in the shower.
[Laughs]

14:13.570 --> 14:15.070
No, we don't even
allow each other to sing

14:15.070 --> 14:16.140
in front of each other.

14:16.140 --> 14:17.540
They're both pretty quirky.

14:17.540 --> 14:19.110
My dad is a huge nerd.

14:19.110 --> 14:21.180
We're most certainly
not singing dentists.

14:21.180 --> 14:22.610
[Laughter]

14:22.610 --> 14:25.720
Both of them know nothing
about music, which is perfect

14:25.720 --> 14:27.920
[laughs] every time
I need any advice.

14:27.950 --> 14:31.320
I'll second that.
How she developed it, we're
still trying to figure that out.

14:31.360 --> 14:32.720
How'd you
get into music?

14:32.760 --> 14:34.730
Started performing
around the age of 9,

14:34.760 --> 14:36.730
ended up getting connected
with a country band,

14:36.760 --> 14:39.330
and we would travel around
the state of Michigan

14:39.330 --> 14:40.370
playing these dinner shows.

14:40.370 --> 14:43.170
 Good ole Rocky Top 

14:43.170 --> 14:46.070
 Rocky Top, Tennessee 

14:46.070 --> 14:47.510
I was hooked.

14:47.510 --> 14:49.970
But I always thought
the more practical thing

14:49.970 --> 14:51.180
was to go to college.

14:51.180 --> 14:53.750
I got my degree
in biopsychology,

14:53.750 --> 14:58.020
neuroscience and cognition,
which is always too much to say.

14:58.020 --> 15:00.720
And then when I graduated,
I had the choice

15:00.750 --> 15:03.320
to go to dental school
or pursue my dream,

15:03.350 --> 15:04.720
and it was a no-brainer.

15:04.760 --> 15:06.890
I ended up moving to Nashville.

15:06.890 --> 15:08.790
Now I feel like
I have the confidence

15:08.790 --> 15:11.360
to take on "The Voice."

15:11.360 --> 15:15.500
I sing country, but I would love
to work with Gwen Stefani.

15:15.500 --> 15:18.600
I think it would help
broaden my scope of music.

15:18.600 --> 15:21.540
I'm gonna be singing "You Were
Meant For Me" by Jewel.

15:21.540 --> 15:24.340
I slowed it up to bring out
the emotion in the song,

15:24.340 --> 15:27.150
and I hope the coaches
feel what I'm feeling.

15:27.150 --> 15:30.220
If I can make a team today,
it would be a validation

15:30.220 --> 15:32.320
to know that I made
the right decision

15:32.320 --> 15:34.620
in choosing music
instead of dental school.

15:34.620 --> 15:36.790
There's no looking back.

15:38.390 --> 15:39.620
Daly:
She looks ready to go.

15:39.660 --> 15:41.990
Come on, girl.
You can do this.

15:50.470 --> 15:52.440
 I hear the clock 

15:52.440 --> 15:54.970
 It's 6:00 a.m. 

15:54.970 --> 15:58.610
 I feel so far
from where I've been 

15:58.610 --> 16:01.150
 Wipe the spots
up off the mirror 

16:01.150 --> 16:03.820
 Don't leave the keys
in the door 

16:03.820 --> 16:07.390
 I never put wet towels
on the floor anymore 

16:07.390 --> 16:08.420
Come on!
What did that take?

16:08.420 --> 16:09.590
Five seconds?
Whoo!

16:09.590 --> 16:10.790
All right! Thank you!

16:10.790 --> 16:12.790
 Dreams last for so long 
Oh, my God!

16:12.790 --> 16:17.730
 Even after you're gone 

16:17.730 --> 16:21.300
 And I know that you love me 

16:21.300 --> 16:26.170
 And soon, you will see 

16:26.170 --> 16:28.540
 You were meant for me 
Hey!

16:28.540 --> 16:32.780
 And I was meant for you 
Wow.

16:36.050 --> 16:37.820
 I brush my teeth 

16:37.820 --> 16:40.220
 Put the cap back on 

16:40.220 --> 16:44.190
 I know you hate it
when I leave the light on 

16:44.190 --> 16:48.660
 I try and tell myself
it'll all be all right 

16:48.660 --> 16:53.060
 But I just shouldn't think
anymore tonight 

16:53.060 --> 16:58.170
 'Cause dreams last
for so long 

16:58.170 --> 17:02.970
 Even after you're gone 

17:02.970 --> 17:06.710
 And I know that you love me 

17:06.710 --> 17:11.079
 And soon you will see 

17:11.079 --> 17:13.890
 You were meant for me 

17:13.890 --> 17:22.160
 And I was meant for you 

17:22.160 --> 17:24.400
[Cheers and applause]

17:26.400 --> 17:27.869
Yeah!

17:29.100 --> 17:30.570
Geez-oh-Pete.

17:32.400 --> 17:34.010
Yeah!

17:34.010 --> 17:36.010
Ay-yi-yi.

17:37.880 --> 17:38.880
Yes, sir!

17:38.880 --> 17:40.180
Well, hi, guys.

17:40.180 --> 17:41.180
What's your name?

17:41.180 --> 17:42.610
My name's Lauren Duski.

17:42.610 --> 17:44.880
I'm 25 years old,
and I'm from Northern Michigan

17:44.880 --> 17:46.720
and just moved to Nashville
two years ago.

17:46.720 --> 17:48.220
Yee-haw!

17:48.220 --> 17:50.090
[Laughs]

17:50.090 --> 17:52.890
I've never heard someone
do that song on the show,

17:52.890 --> 17:55.360
and I think you really
took that to a new place.

17:55.360 --> 17:59.230
What you do is the subtlety
and the soulfulness

17:59.230 --> 18:01.370
that the winner of this show
needs to have.

18:01.370 --> 18:03.170
And I think it would be
the most refreshing thing

18:03.170 --> 18:05.340
in this show's history
for someone like you
to win "The Voice."

18:05.340 --> 18:08.510
Thank you so, so, so much.

18:08.510 --> 18:10.170
[Applause]

18:10.170 --> 18:12.910
- Hi, Gwen!
- Hi, Lauren.

18:12.910 --> 18:16.350
What I was so blown away by was,
there's not a lot of singers

18:16.350 --> 18:18.650
that use every single
part of their voice.

18:18.650 --> 18:20.720
You were singing in your head
voice, your chest voice.

18:20.720 --> 18:22.920
I don't feel like I get
to hear that very often.

18:22.920 --> 18:25.690
But I would love
to work on getting more

18:25.690 --> 18:26.890
of your personality out.

18:26.890 --> 18:28.730
Doing music
is to share your story,

18:28.760 --> 18:31.430
and that's what I would
love to do with you.

18:31.430 --> 18:32.830
Thank you, Gwen.

18:32.830 --> 18:35.270
[Applause]

18:35.270 --> 18:36.770
Hi, Blake.

18:36.770 --> 18:37.870
Hi, Lauren.

18:37.870 --> 18:38.900
Wait a minute.
Don't skip over me

18:38.900 --> 18:39.970
just because I didn't
turn around.

18:39.970 --> 18:41.010
Oh, no, no,
I'm so sorry.

18:41.010 --> 18:42.110
We were having a moment
just then.

18:42.110 --> 18:43.710
Thanks a lot, Alicia!
[Laughs]

18:43.710 --> 18:45.610
- Uh...
- I just want to agree

18:45.610 --> 18:47.780
with everyone that you
really are a special artist,

18:47.780 --> 18:49.050
and thank you for showcasing.

18:49.050 --> 18:50.680
Thank you.

18:50.680 --> 18:51.720
[Applause]

18:51.720 --> 18:53.550
Now can we get back
to our moment?

18:53.550 --> 18:55.520
- Go ahead.
- [Laughs] Yes, Blake.

18:55.550 --> 18:58.790
You're somebody who
clearly can win this thing.

18:58.790 --> 19:00.960
Thank you.
Thank you.

19:00.960 --> 19:02.590
[Applause]

19:02.590 --> 19:05.900
I also want to work with people
who I think can go on

19:05.900 --> 19:08.830
to be a star, especially
with a country artist.

19:08.830 --> 19:10.270
Adam: Has anybody asked her,
by the way?

19:10.270 --> 19:11.700
What do you want to do?

19:11.700 --> 19:13.740
I always consider
myself a country singer,

19:13.740 --> 19:16.770
but I love to sing
anything that moves me.

19:16.770 --> 19:19.780
Exactly, music,
genre-less, beautiful music

19:19.780 --> 19:20.680
that suits you best.
Yeah.

19:20.680 --> 19:22.180
If you can find me
one of those

19:22.180 --> 19:25.580
good genre-less radio stations
that they're gonna play you on,

19:25.580 --> 19:27.390
I can't wait
to crank it up.

19:27.390 --> 19:28.990
I'm just gonna
tell you this, Lauren.

19:28.990 --> 19:31.320
I believed really blindly
from the beginning in you.

19:31.360 --> 19:33.620
I follow my instincts
through my whole life.

19:33.660 --> 19:35.190
My instincts
have been kind to me so far,

19:35.190 --> 19:37.530
so keep me in mind
when you're making this choice.

19:37.530 --> 19:39.430
[Applause]
Thank you, Adam.

19:39.430 --> 19:41.930
So, do I ask a question,
or is there any more...

19:41.930 --> 19:44.000
Are you kidding me?
This is on.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.640
It's not over.
No way.

19:45.640 --> 19:47.210
This is
the craziest moment.

19:47.210 --> 19:50.240
I'm the perfect choice because
I'm somewhere in the middle.

19:50.240 --> 19:52.940
How many
Blake Shelton concerts

19:52.940 --> 19:54.680
have I been to
in the last year?

19:54.680 --> 19:57.480
[Laughs]
I mean...

19:57.480 --> 19:59.380
I've never missed one.

19:59.380 --> 20:01.420
I've done a duet with Adam.

20:01.420 --> 20:04.190
I've done a duet with Blake.

20:04.190 --> 20:05.720
Hello.

20:05.760 --> 20:08.290
Genre boundaries...
there is no boundaries.

20:08.290 --> 20:12.000
All right, Lauren.
Who do you pick as your coach?

20:12.000 --> 20:14.970
[Audience shouting]

20:20.170 --> 20:22.370
- Who's it gonna be?
- Maybe Gwen.

20:22.370 --> 20:23.710
Gwen put up
a good argument.

20:27.150 --> 20:29.350
Come on, Lauren!
Come home!

20:36.390 --> 20:37.920
I pick Blake.
Yeah!

20:37.960 --> 20:40.490
 I'm just a guy with a girl
everybody wants to know 

20:40.490 --> 20:41.730
Whoo-hoo!

20:41.760 --> 20:45.300
 Wishin' you were there alone 
Oh, man!

20:45.300 --> 20:46.660
Yes!

20:46.660 --> 20:48.870
Blake: Lauren Duski
is somebody who has a chance

20:48.870 --> 20:50.540
to go on and have a record deal.

20:50.540 --> 20:53.100
I couldn't be happier
that she chose me as her coach.

20:53.100 --> 20:55.510
Am I in trouble?
I picked Blake, too.

20:55.510 --> 20:57.840
[Laughs]

20:57.840 --> 21:00.110
Adam: I definitely lost
a couple people I really loved,

21:00.110 --> 21:01.750
but I ain't giving up.

21:01.750 --> 21:05.450
Nice job, Lauren.

21:05.450 --> 21:07.320
You got a good one,
buddy.

21:07.320 --> 21:08.620
Oh,
that hurt Adam so much.

21:08.650 --> 21:10.090
Oh, that makes me so happy.

21:10.090 --> 21:11.090
That was a fight.

21:11.090 --> 21:12.420
Ultimately,
what was it about Blake?

21:12.460 --> 21:14.390
My heart and soul
is in country music,

21:14.390 --> 21:15.860
and he's the king of country.

21:15.860 --> 21:16.930
I'm so excited.

21:16.960 --> 21:18.300
- Me too.
- You're in great hands.

21:18.300 --> 21:20.770
And now I have to go
make up with Gwen.

21:20.770 --> 21:23.130
All right.
So, she did give you that look.

21:23.130 --> 21:24.770
She was amazing.
That girl can win.

21:24.770 --> 21:26.570
- She was really good.
- Hey, Blake!

21:26.570 --> 21:27.740
What?

21:27.740 --> 21:30.240
 Your girlfriend's
sitting next to me 

21:30.240 --> 21:32.280
[Audience cheering]

21:32.280 --> 21:33.880
Jealous?

21:33.880 --> 21:35.610
[Laughter]

21:35.610 --> 21:37.820
Daly: Coming up...
 He'll never walk away 

21:37.820 --> 21:40.420
 He'll never break her heart 

21:40.420 --> 21:41.690
- Whoo!
- [Laughs]

21:41.690 --> 21:43.620
That is a big voice.

21:43.650 --> 21:45.290
- Wow.
- Shut up.

21:45.290 --> 21:46.720
- Oh, my God.
- Right now, I feel like

21:46.760 --> 21:48.030
I'm here to work with you.

21:48.060 --> 21:50.260
- Hey, hey!
- [Laughs]

21:50.260 --> 21:52.860
You belong in the current
landscape of pop music.

21:52.860 --> 21:53.930
Daly: And later...

21:53.930 --> 21:55.330
Felicia: There definitely
was a possibility

21:55.330 --> 21:56.930
that I wouldn't sing again,

21:56.930 --> 22:00.610
so it's so beautiful
for things to turn around.

22:00.610 --> 22:06.110
 I never loved someone 

22:08.480 --> 22:10.320
 This is "The Voice" 

22:10.580 --> 22:13.320
Daly: Welcome back
to the blind auditions.

22:13.350 --> 22:16.220
Okay, let's just focus on me
for a second, everyone.

22:16.260 --> 22:18.790
- [Laughs]
- Queen of the four-chair turn.

22:18.790 --> 22:20.590
 Queen of the four,
queen of the 

22:20.590 --> 22:21.830
 Queen of the,
queen of the four 

22:21.860 --> 22:23.330
It's one four-chair turn.

22:23.330 --> 22:24.560
It's, like...
No, it's, like...

22:24.560 --> 22:26.430
You're like more like the
princess of the four-turn.

22:26.430 --> 22:27.600
[Laughter]

22:27.600 --> 22:30.240
Daly: This next artist
is a familiar face.

22:30.240 --> 22:34.070
I'm Johnny Hayes,
and I am back for Season 12.

22:34.070 --> 22:37.680
 I'm just a traveler
on this earth 

22:37.680 --> 22:39.810
Last season,
as disappointing as it was,

22:39.810 --> 22:42.720
I did take away
a lot of great advice.

22:42.720 --> 22:44.550
If it was a bit more
about you,

22:44.550 --> 22:45.990
I feel like
you would just own it

22:45.990 --> 22:48.190
and really be like,
"Here's me."

22:48.190 --> 22:49.920
[Applause]

22:49.960 --> 22:52.460
After last season,
I started working with my dad,

22:52.460 --> 22:54.230
doing landscaping.

22:54.260 --> 22:58.470
John: Johnny and I do everything
from trimming, mowing, blowing.

22:58.470 --> 23:01.600
He usually does the brunt stuff
to help the old man out.

23:03.200 --> 23:05.010
My dad's taught me that,
if you want to be

23:05.010 --> 23:07.910
successful in anything,
whether it's cutting the grass

23:07.910 --> 23:10.780
or playing music,
you got to work really hard.

23:13.650 --> 23:15.920
My wife has never
given up on me.

23:15.920 --> 23:18.490
She's encouraged me
to be a better musician,

23:18.490 --> 23:21.820
a better person, a better
husband every single day.

23:21.860 --> 23:27.390
And to be able to have Meredith
in my corner, it's priceless.

23:27.390 --> 23:29.100
For my blind audition,
I'll be singing

23:29.100 --> 23:31.430
"Try a Little Tenderness,"
by Otis Redding.

23:34.370 --> 23:38.100
It was the song that me
and my wife fell in love to.

23:38.100 --> 23:40.910
When we went on
our first date together,

23:40.910 --> 23:44.010
we played this game
to pick a song for each other

23:44.010 --> 23:45.380
on the jukebox.

23:45.380 --> 23:47.180
To each of our surprise,
we both picked

23:47.180 --> 23:48.920
the same exact song,
and that was it.

23:48.920 --> 23:50.720
The rest is history.

23:50.720 --> 23:52.320
Meredith: This is just
a big step, hopefully,

23:52.320 --> 23:55.390
for a lot of people to fall in
love with him just like I have.

23:55.390 --> 23:57.620
Johnny: The last time,
the coaches didn't feel me.

23:57.660 --> 24:00.090
So this song is
true to who I am.

24:00.090 --> 24:02.960
This song has already
changed my life once.

24:02.960 --> 24:06.270
When I walk through those doors,
it will change again.

24:09.670 --> 24:13.870
 Oh, she may be weary 

24:13.870 --> 24:15.640
 Them young girls 

24:15.640 --> 24:18.340
 They do get weary 

24:18.340 --> 24:24.580
 Wearing that
same old shaggy dress 

24:24.580 --> 24:27.350
 Yeah, yeah, yeah 

24:29.090 --> 24:34.160
 But when she gets weary 

24:34.160 --> 24:42.100
 Try a little tenderness 

24:42.100 --> 24:47.840
 Oh, ooh, ooh 

24:47.840 --> 24:51.040
 Oh, you won't regret it 

24:51.040 --> 24:52.610
 No, no 

24:52.610 --> 24:59.020
 If you try,
try a little tenderness 

24:59.020 --> 25:02.090
 All you got to do, man 

25:02.090 --> 25:04.820
 Is hold her if you want her 

25:04.860 --> 25:06.730
 Got to squeeze her 

25:06.760 --> 25:08.560
 Don't tease her 

25:08.560 --> 25:10.460
 Never leave her 

25:10.460 --> 25:13.400
 Got to, got to try 

25:13.400 --> 25:19.670
 Try a little tenderness 

25:19.670 --> 25:23.440
 You got to know
how to love her, man 

25:23.440 --> 25:25.710
 You got to hold her 

25:25.710 --> 25:27.180
 Squeeze her 

25:27.180 --> 25:29.550
 Never leave her 

25:29.550 --> 25:31.950
 Got to try
and na, na, na 

25:31.950 --> 25:37.820
 Try, try a little tenderness 

25:37.860 --> 25:40.290
 Oh, oh 

25:40.290 --> 25:43.360
[Cheers and applause]

25:44.960 --> 25:46.300
Whoo!

25:51.700 --> 25:54.070
- Okay.
- Okay, time out.

25:54.070 --> 25:57.040
- Whoa.
- Time out!

25:57.040 --> 25:58.040
[Laughter]

25:58.040 --> 25:59.450
So, one, two.

25:59.450 --> 26:01.310
You did not push, correct,
neither one of you.

26:01.310 --> 26:03.250
Oh, my God.

26:03.250 --> 26:04.920
[Laughter]

26:04.920 --> 26:06.490
And you look familiar,
too.

26:06.490 --> 26:08.620
I was actually...
I auditioned last season.

26:08.620 --> 26:10.390
[Grunts] Yes!

26:10.390 --> 26:12.190
I'm Johnny Hayes.
I'm 29 years old.

26:12.190 --> 26:13.160
I'm from Mobile, Alabama.

26:13.160 --> 26:14.430
I remember, man.
Alabama, yeah.

26:14.460 --> 26:15.430
And I'm sorry.
My heart is racing.

26:15.460 --> 26:16.960
It's so good to see your faces.

26:16.960 --> 26:19.000
It's so amazing when someone,
"Yeah, I'll come back."

26:19.000 --> 26:21.400
But he did it, and then he got
turned, and now we're here.

26:21.400 --> 26:22.740
Yeah, man.

26:22.740 --> 26:24.640
Singing Otis is not
something you can get away with

26:24.640 --> 26:26.340
u-unless you
can do it right,

26:26.340 --> 26:28.510
and you did
the almost impossible.

26:28.510 --> 26:30.310
I mean, I don't know
about you guys,

26:30.310 --> 26:31.950
but did you not
feel the energy?

26:31.950 --> 26:33.580
[Cheers and applause]
Thank you so much.

26:33.580 --> 26:35.550
I love her to death,

26:35.550 --> 26:37.780
but I must destroy her
for these purposes.

26:37.780 --> 26:39.120
[Laughter]

26:39.150 --> 26:40.720
I can't deal with
not having you.

26:40.750 --> 26:44.320
And don't let her use
her thing with him to
influence you at all.

26:44.360 --> 26:46.330
Yeah, use my thing
with him to influence you,

26:46.360 --> 26:49.130
because that means you got
double, like, double power.

26:49.130 --> 26:50.560
No, you don't.
He's not gonna coach you.

26:50.560 --> 26:52.230
Hey, Johnny,
it didn't take Gwen two times

26:52.230 --> 26:53.830
to hear you sing
before she hit her button.

26:53.830 --> 26:56.240
Exactly. Although, I didn't
miss you last season, did I?

26:56.240 --> 26:57.940
Because she wasn't here.
Unh-unh.

26:57.940 --> 26:59.570
[Laughter]
Anyway, you didn't push

26:59.570 --> 27:01.470
for Johnny, so shut up.

27:01.470 --> 27:02.740
[Laughter]

27:02.740 --> 27:03.940
Were you nervous at all?

27:03.940 --> 27:05.180
A little bit.

27:05.180 --> 27:07.280
I just wanted my wife
to think I sounded good.

27:07.280 --> 27:08.450
[Audience Awws]
That was our song.

27:08.450 --> 27:10.350
Oh, that's cute.

27:10.350 --> 27:12.620
- Aww.
- That's what I'm talking about.

27:12.620 --> 27:15.720
You are delivering a performance
from your heart.

27:15.760 --> 27:19.590
That's really all I care about,
is passion and truth,

27:19.590 --> 27:21.530
so I would really love
to work with you.

27:21.560 --> 27:23.000
And I want to fight Adam, too.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.700
- Oh!
- Uh-oh.

27:24.700 --> 27:26.500
Now I have to worry about
you getting mad at me

27:26.500 --> 27:27.870
and Blake
getting mad at me.

27:27.870 --> 27:29.270
[Laughter]
This sucks.

27:29.270 --> 27:31.540
I was just gonna say, Johnny,
that this is

27:31.540 --> 27:35.210
a really beautiful testament
to determination and tenacity

27:35.210 --> 27:37.110
and never, ever
letting a "no" stop you

27:37.110 --> 27:38.510
from doing what you dream.

27:38.510 --> 27:40.680
[Cheers and applause]
Thank you.

27:40.680 --> 27:42.250
Thank you so much.

27:42.250 --> 27:44.420
Go ahead, Blake.

27:44.420 --> 27:45.720
[Laughter]

27:45.720 --> 27:47.090
Don't buy that.

27:47.090 --> 27:50.290
I see two people in this room
who've made a comeback,

27:50.290 --> 27:52.990
and one is you,
and the other is Gwen.

27:52.990 --> 27:55.800
I mean, if there's been
a comeback in the music industry

27:55.800 --> 27:57.730
like hers
in the last 10 years,

27:57.730 --> 27:59.670
I'd like to know
who it's been.

27:59.670 --> 28:03.370
You put those two energies
together... wow.

28:03.370 --> 28:05.370
Wow.

28:05.370 --> 28:08.240
[Applause]

28:08.240 --> 28:10.140
It really just comes down to
what you want to do

28:10.140 --> 28:11.810
and who you want to work with
and where your heart's at.

28:11.810 --> 28:14.050
Agreed.

28:14.050 --> 28:15.250
Who do you pick
as your coach?

28:15.250 --> 28:17.420
[Audience shouting]

28:17.420 --> 28:18.750
Whoever you want, babe.

28:21.150 --> 28:22.560
So...

28:30.700 --> 28:31.830
I choose Adam.

28:31.830 --> 28:33.600
[Cheers and applause]
Yes.

28:37.100 --> 28:39.240
Adam: Johnny Hayes is my first
addition to the team.

28:39.240 --> 28:39.970
I couldn't be happier.

28:39.970 --> 28:41.310
Dude, yes!

28:41.310 --> 28:43.580
Everyone loves
a comeback kid like that.

28:43.580 --> 28:45.150
And you watch out
for Johnny Hayes.

28:45.150 --> 28:47.450
You were screwed
from the beginning.
Thank you. Thank you.

28:47.450 --> 28:49.320
You were screwed
from the beginning.

28:49.320 --> 28:51.380
[Audience Awws]

28:51.380 --> 28:53.320
[Groans]

28:53.320 --> 28:55.020
Daly: Coming up...
You.

28:55.020 --> 28:56.090
I pushed it first.

28:56.090 --> 28:57.590
When they both pushed,
they're, like, dating,

28:57.590 --> 28:58.620
and I don't know
what to do.

28:58.660 --> 28:59.930
I'm like a third wheel
in this thing.

28:59.960 --> 29:02.160
 So you better
run, run, run away 

29:02.160 --> 29:04.330
 Run away, baby 

29:04.330 --> 29:06.270
I need you on my team!
Oh, my God!

29:06.270 --> 29:07.530
You're amazing.

29:07.530 --> 29:08.870
I want to remind you that
this is a competition.

29:08.870 --> 29:09.700
Oh, man.

29:09.700 --> 29:10.500
- Who do you...
- Pick...

29:10.500 --> 29:11.270
- As your...
- Coach?

29:11.270 --> 29:12.870
[Screams]

29:12.870 --> 29:15.810
Daly: Download "The Voice"
official app

29:15.810 --> 29:19.110
and play along with our coaches
all season long.

29:22.420 --> 29:23.790
 This is "The Voice" 

29:23.790 --> 29:24.920
Daly: Welcome back.

29:24.920 --> 29:26.690
Let's meet the next artist.

29:26.690 --> 29:28.190
[Siren wails]

29:28.190 --> 29:31.230
My name is Skyler Harris,
I'm 25 years old,

29:31.260 --> 29:33.560
and I'm a police officer
in Murfreesboro, Tennessee.

29:33.560 --> 29:36.060
I'm a crisis intervention
team member,

29:36.060 --> 29:38.030
so what that means is that,
one minute, I might be

29:38.030 --> 29:40.700
responding to a call
of somebody who's suicidal,

29:40.700 --> 29:42.740
and then the next minute,

29:42.740 --> 29:44.810
I might just be
out jumping rope with kids.

29:44.810 --> 29:47.780
There's a huge difference
and change throughout the day,

29:47.780 --> 29:49.180
and I love that about it.

29:49.180 --> 29:50.650
Music is a huge part of my life.

29:50.650 --> 29:52.010
But working a full-time job,

29:52.010 --> 29:53.820
there's not a lot
of time to gig.

29:53.820 --> 29:57.820
So, being on "The Voice"
would reshape my entire career.

29:57.850 --> 29:59.520
Man:
All right, y'all be safe.

29:59.520 --> 30:01.790
I started out singing,
like, at church.

30:01.790 --> 30:03.560
Oh, cool.
And I sang a little bit

30:03.560 --> 30:05.490
in college,
but then I got involved

30:05.490 --> 30:06.860
in an abusive relationship.

30:06.860 --> 30:08.730
While I was involved
in that relationship,

30:08.730 --> 30:10.070
I was a 911 dispatcher.

30:10.070 --> 30:11.300
Now I'm not just
taking the calls,

30:11.300 --> 30:13.700
but I know what it's like
to be on the other end.

30:13.700 --> 30:15.600
How many calls did
you get of domestic abuse?

30:15.600 --> 30:17.340
Just me answering,
at least 20 a day.

30:17.340 --> 30:18.410
You were giving
everybody else advice

30:18.410 --> 30:19.440
that you weren't taking.

30:19.440 --> 30:22.010
That I wasn't even taking.
Exactly.

30:22.010 --> 30:26.920
During that time,
everything about me was gone.

30:26.920 --> 30:29.790
And so for me,
that meant that I didn't sing.

30:29.790 --> 30:32.020
One night, I was
sitting on the patio,

30:32.020 --> 30:34.320
and I started humming
a song to myself.

30:34.360 --> 30:37.360
And I just turned back into that
little girl in that youth choir.

30:37.360 --> 30:38.790
I just kept thinking,

30:38.790 --> 30:40.860
"All I have to do is get up
and walk away from this

30:40.860 --> 30:42.600
and everything will change."

30:42.600 --> 30:47.440
So that night, I went to sleep,
I had a plan.

30:47.440 --> 30:49.170
So the next morning, I moved,

30:49.170 --> 30:51.110
packed everything in
my little car, and...

30:51.110 --> 30:52.440
Good for you.
...here I am.

30:52.440 --> 30:53.740
Which was the first step
in getting music

30:53.740 --> 30:54.740
right back in your life.

30:54.740 --> 30:56.580
Right.
Music saved my life.

30:56.580 --> 30:59.010
Each one of these coaches
is amazing in their own right,

30:59.010 --> 31:02.250
but if Alicia Keys turns for me
today, I will lose it.

31:02.250 --> 31:04.420
I have 90 seconds

31:04.420 --> 31:07.520
to give them
25 years of heartbreak,

31:07.560 --> 31:11.760
25 years of dreaming,
and hope that they hear me.

31:11.760 --> 31:12.890
She's right there.

31:20.840 --> 31:26.370
 Mm, mm 

31:26.370 --> 31:30.650
 You've been on my mind 

31:30.650 --> 31:35.620
 I grow fonder every day 

31:35.620 --> 31:40.720
 Lose myself in time 

31:40.760 --> 31:45.830
 Just thinkin' of your face 

31:45.860 --> 31:48.300
 I don't know why I'm scared 

31:48.300 --> 31:50.430
 'Cause I've been here before 

31:50.430 --> 31:52.730
 Every feeling, every word 

31:52.730 --> 31:55.100
 I've imagined it all 

31:55.100 --> 31:56.100
Wow.

31:56.100 --> 31:57.840
 You never know 

31:57.840 --> 32:02.510
 If you never try
to forgive your past 

32:02.510 --> 32:06.280
 And simply be mine 

32:06.280 --> 32:07.420
 Oh 

32:07.420 --> 32:10.320
 I dare you to let me be 

32:10.320 --> 32:16.490
 Your one and only 

32:16.490 --> 32:20.860
 I promise I'm worthy, baby 

32:20.860 --> 32:26.670
 Until the end 

32:26.670 --> 32:37.780
 Starts 

32:37.780 --> 32:41.350
[Cheers and applause]

32:42.950 --> 32:44.720
Good job. Good job.
I can't believe that.

32:44.720 --> 32:46.150
I can't believe that.

32:48.290 --> 32:49.690
- Hello.
- Oh, my gosh.

32:49.690 --> 32:50.760
What's your name?

32:50.760 --> 32:51.890
Hi.
My name is Skyler Harris.

32:51.890 --> 32:54.060
I'm 25.
I'm from Memphis, Tennessee.

32:54.060 --> 32:59.630
There is no denying that
you have an incredible voice.

32:59.630 --> 33:01.800
Thank you.

33:01.800 --> 33:05.470
It's unbelievable, your skill,
but there needs to be something

33:05.470 --> 33:07.810
that sticks out
that is, like, you.

33:07.810 --> 33:10.950
That makes you go,
"Wait. She can do all that,

33:10.950 --> 33:12.550
but I feel her, too."

33:12.550 --> 33:15.480
I think you're unbelievable,
and I think you could come back,

33:15.480 --> 33:16.920
and I think
you would get a turn.

33:16.920 --> 33:18.420
- Thank you.
- I'd really love to know

33:18.450 --> 33:20.690
a little bit more about you
and what this song meant to you.

33:20.690 --> 33:23.460
While I was in college, I was in
an abusive relationship.

33:23.460 --> 33:27.530
Shortly after that, I decided
to become a police officer,

33:27.530 --> 33:28.460
and that's what I do now.

33:28.460 --> 33:29.600
- Wow.
- Wow.

33:29.600 --> 33:30.930
- Cool.
- Yeah.

33:30.930 --> 33:32.930
[Applause]

33:32.930 --> 33:35.470
For me, that song just means
choosing myself, finally.

33:35.470 --> 33:36.670
Mm.

33:36.670 --> 33:39.810
And give me the chance
to be my one and only.

33:39.810 --> 33:42.010
I'd rather be by myself
than be involved

33:42.010 --> 33:43.980
in another relationship
like that, so...

33:43.980 --> 33:45.910
[Applause]

33:45.910 --> 33:49.220
When you sang,
I felt such a power, right?

33:49.220 --> 33:50.720
And I don't know
if I got the chance

33:50.720 --> 33:54.320
to feel this vulnerability
and this uncertainty

33:54.360 --> 33:55.820
so that you could
really bring us in

33:55.860 --> 33:57.960
to this beautiful story
that you have

33:57.960 --> 33:59.690
that the whole world
deserves to hear

33:59.690 --> 34:01.900
because you're gonna save
a lot of women like this...

34:01.900 --> 34:04.230
Oh, yeah.
...and a lot of people, you
know, who need to hear that

34:04.230 --> 34:05.730
it's okay to walk away.

34:05.730 --> 34:07.700
I mean, that's... that's
an amazing thing you
just said right here.

34:07.700 --> 34:10.540
If that alone is shared.

34:10.540 --> 34:11.739
Thank you.

34:11.739 --> 34:14.380
I think you're one
that probably,

34:14.380 --> 34:17.250
we're a little bit frustrated
that we didn't turn around for.

34:17.250 --> 34:20.480
But that's good news for you,
if there is any good news.

34:20.480 --> 34:22.580
You should come back.

34:22.580 --> 34:24.620
Yeah.
Come back and see us, okay?

34:24.650 --> 34:25.920
I will.

34:25.949 --> 34:28.219
[Applause]

34:28.260 --> 34:29.920
I really wanted
those chairs to turn,

34:29.960 --> 34:32.690
but another part of me feels
like this is just another chance

34:32.690 --> 34:34.100
for me to bounce back.

34:34.100 --> 34:36.630
I've done it before,
and I'll keep doing it again.

34:36.630 --> 34:39.199
You're so incredible.
I'm so happy to meet you.

34:39.199 --> 34:41.239
Alicia: Skyler was really great,

34:41.239 --> 34:43.710
but somehow, I think
it was missing this kind of,

34:43.710 --> 34:44.969
like, connection.

34:44.969 --> 34:47.210
So I wasn't able to
get lost in it the way that

34:47.210 --> 34:49.810
I think she really
could have made us do.

34:49.810 --> 34:51.679
She's a great artist.

34:51.679 --> 34:53.710
I was gonna turn around
16 times.

34:53.710 --> 34:55.280
I know.
Me too.

34:58.420 --> 35:00.320
 This is "The Voice" 

35:00.660 --> 35:02.730
Daly: Welcome back
to the blind auditions.

35:02.730 --> 35:04.760
 Sing us a song 

35:04.760 --> 35:07.430
I'm ready.
Ready for the magic.

35:07.430 --> 35:10.370
Here we go,
about to get me one.

35:10.370 --> 35:12.170
My name's Anatalia Villaranda.

35:12.170 --> 35:14.840
I'm 16 years old, and I'm
from Temecula, California.

35:14.840 --> 35:16.040
[Groans, laughs]

35:16.040 --> 35:17.910
I'm a very petite person.

35:17.910 --> 35:20.380
Being 4'9", a lot of people,
like, pick on me

35:20.410 --> 35:23.310
because of my size, but good
things come in small packages,

35:23.310 --> 35:26.280
so here's me.
[Laughs]

35:26.280 --> 35:27.690
My family's Filipino,

35:27.690 --> 35:32.290
and we literally go karaoke
all the time and sing a lot.

35:32.290 --> 35:35.560
Growing up,
she was a handful.

35:35.560 --> 35:37.260
[Laughter]

35:37.260 --> 35:38.760
She started when she was 10,

35:38.760 --> 35:41.370
and she asked me
to join the talent show.

35:41.370 --> 35:43.230
Then I asked her,
"What talent do you have?"

35:43.230 --> 35:44.970
And she goes,
"Well, I'm gonna sing."

35:45.000 --> 35:46.170
And she won.

35:46.200 --> 35:48.470
And I'm, like,
"How did this happen?"

35:48.510 --> 35:51.040
My first talent show led me
to a singing and dancing group.

35:51.040 --> 35:53.140
We performed all around L.A.

35:53.140 --> 35:55.150
We were super close
to a record deal,

35:55.150 --> 35:58.250
but unfortunately,
we fell apart.

35:58.250 --> 36:00.850
And so I've been singing
all around Temecula.

36:00.850 --> 36:03.790
I sing for my school now
in show choir.

36:03.790 --> 36:05.520
But it would mean the world

36:05.520 --> 36:07.790
if I got to work with
any one of the coaches.

36:07.790 --> 36:09.660
They can give me a jump start
in my career

36:09.660 --> 36:11.500
and change my life forever.

36:13.700 --> 36:15.830
[Laughs]

36:22.440 --> 36:23.540
[Siren wailing]

36:23.540 --> 36:25.340
 Well, looky here,
looky here 

36:25.340 --> 36:26.840
 Oh, what do we have? 

36:26.840 --> 36:29.880
 Another pretty thing
ready for me to grab 

36:29.880 --> 36:32.320
 But little does she know that
I'm a wolf in sheep's clothing 

36:32.320 --> 36:33.880
 'Cause at the end
of the night 

36:33.880 --> 36:35.450
 It is him I'll be holding 

36:35.450 --> 36:37.050
Whoo!
 I love you so 

36:37.050 --> 36:38.360
 That's what you'll say 

36:38.360 --> 36:41.090
 You tell me baby, baby,
please don't go away 

36:41.090 --> 36:42.560
 But when I play 

36:42.560 --> 36:44.060
 I never stay 

36:44.060 --> 36:47.530
 To every guy that I meet,
hey, this is what I say 

36:47.530 --> 36:49.030
 Run, run, run away 

36:49.030 --> 36:50.500
 Run away, baby 

36:50.500 --> 36:52.540
 Before I put my spell on you 

36:52.540 --> 36:54.670
 You better
get, get, get away 

36:54.710 --> 36:56.240
 Get away, darling 

36:56.240 --> 36:58.380
 'Cause everything
you heard is true 

36:58.410 --> 37:01.210
 Your poor little heart
will end up alone 

37:01.210 --> 37:04.310
 'Cause Lord knows
I'm a rolling stone 

37:04.310 --> 37:06.520
 So you better
run, run, run away 

37:06.520 --> 37:08.520
 Run away, baby 

37:08.520 --> 37:10.420
[Siren wailing]

37:10.420 --> 37:12.060
 Well, let me think,
let me think 

37:12.060 --> 37:13.360
 Oh, what should I do? 

37:13.360 --> 37:14.930
 So many eager young bunnies 

37:14.930 --> 37:16.590
 That I'd like to pursue 
Come on!

37:16.590 --> 37:19.230
 Now even though they eating
out the palm of my hand 

37:19.230 --> 37:22.270
 There's only one carrot,
and they all gotta share it 

37:22.270 --> 37:24.540
 Ain't trying
to hurt you baby 
Oh, she's so close!

37:24.540 --> 37:26.870
 No, no, I just want
to work you, baby 

37:26.870 --> 37:29.440
 If you scared,
you better run 

37:29.440 --> 37:34.480
 You better run 

37:34.510 --> 37:37.310
 Ru-u-u-u-u-u-n 

37:37.310 --> 37:39.720
 Before I put my spell
on you 

37:39.720 --> 37:41.690
 You better
get, get, get away 

37:41.690 --> 37:42.990
 Get away, darling 

37:42.990 --> 37:45.590
 'Cause everything
you heard is true 

37:45.590 --> 37:48.090
 Your poor little heart
will end up alone 
Yes?

37:48.090 --> 37:51.860
 'Cause Lord knows
I'm a rolling stone 

37:51.860 --> 37:57.000
 Run, run, run away, baby 

37:57.000 --> 37:58.840
[Cheers and applause]

37:58.840 --> 38:00.000
Thank you.

38:01.540 --> 38:02.770
Thank you.

38:02.810 --> 38:04.340
Whoo!

38:04.340 --> 38:05.780
[Sobs]

38:05.810 --> 38:08.180
- Hey!
- Yeah!

38:08.180 --> 38:10.110
- Hey!
- I'm so hyper!

38:10.110 --> 38:11.220
Whoo!

38:11.220 --> 38:13.320
That is a big voice.

38:13.320 --> 38:15.520
Tell us who you are.

38:15.520 --> 38:18.320
My name is Anatalia Villaranda,
and I'm 16 years old,

38:18.320 --> 38:19.820
and I'm from
Temecula, California.

38:19.820 --> 38:21.590
Wow.

38:21.590 --> 38:24.630
[Shouting indistinctly]
Whoo!

38:24.630 --> 38:26.230
First of all,
your family is amazing.

38:26.230 --> 38:27.900
[Laughter]

38:27.900 --> 38:30.030
They're the best.

38:30.030 --> 38:32.140
Just because I got to see this,
will you bring them out here?

38:32.140 --> 38:33.840
Yes.
Come here!

38:33.840 --> 38:35.640
Look how excited
she got.

38:35.640 --> 38:38.710
[Laughter]
Whoo!

38:43.110 --> 38:45.020
Yeah!

38:45.020 --> 38:47.450
Oh, oh.

38:47.450 --> 38:49.020
I'm so happy right now.

38:49.020 --> 38:51.020
It's a shame you don't have
such a supportive family.

38:51.020 --> 38:52.620
[Laughter]

38:52.620 --> 38:55.390
Wow.

38:55.390 --> 38:56.390
Hey,
don't hurt her yet.

38:56.390 --> 38:57.760
I need her to be healthy
on my team.

38:57.760 --> 38:59.600
Little brother's like...

38:59.600 --> 39:02.170
I'm sorry.
I'm just so proud.

39:02.170 --> 39:04.570
Oh, my gosh.
That's so cute.

39:04.570 --> 39:07.140
Oh, my gosh. Y'all,
I'm about to melt, seriously.

39:07.140 --> 39:08.640
Okay, family,
we got business here.

39:08.640 --> 39:09.970
Let us talk to her.

39:10.010 --> 39:11.810
- Bye, family!
- Bye!

39:11.810 --> 39:13.980
Bye. Thank you!

39:14.010 --> 39:16.980
Okay, Anatalia, a lot of people
turn that energy

39:16.980 --> 39:20.650
into a colossal train wreck,
and you turned it into,

39:20.650 --> 39:24.760
like, "No, I'm gonna keep
beating you guys down

39:24.760 --> 39:26.820
until somebody hits
their freakin' button."

39:26.820 --> 39:27.990
That's what it felt like.

39:27.990 --> 39:29.730
Too bad you don't have
any personality.

39:29.730 --> 39:31.500
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

39:31.500 --> 39:33.760
[Applause]

39:33.760 --> 39:35.200
You know what got me?
When you started going,

39:35.200 --> 39:37.200
"Hey, hey,
and I want to, hey, hey."

39:37.200 --> 39:38.740
I was, like, "Whoa!"

39:38.740 --> 39:41.840
I said, "Wait a minute.
This is more than just a voice.

39:41.840 --> 39:45.010
This is an artist
unafraid to express yourself."

39:45.010 --> 39:48.250
And I would like you
to look in your heart and see

39:48.250 --> 39:50.680
how important it is for you
to be on my team.

39:50.680 --> 39:52.350
[Laughs]

39:52.350 --> 39:54.020
You're amazing.

39:54.020 --> 39:55.090
Thank you so much.

39:55.090 --> 39:57.850
What I relate to the most
is that energy

39:57.850 --> 39:59.020
to get everybody going.

39:59.020 --> 40:02.090
You have to understand,
I am just

40:02.090 --> 40:04.600
from Anaheim, California,
in a band,

40:04.600 --> 40:06.200
and then writing
"Just a Girl."

40:06.200 --> 40:08.730
But I feel like
I'm at a point in my life

40:08.730 --> 40:12.470
where I got this opportunity to
share it with somebody like you.

40:12.470 --> 40:14.670
So, I just really feel
passionate

40:14.670 --> 40:16.940
about you
and your positivity.

40:16.940 --> 40:18.840
Yeah.
And I would love

40:18.840 --> 40:21.080
to talk about how we can
show your personality

40:21.110 --> 40:23.110
through fashion,
and I think we could work

40:23.110 --> 40:24.620
really well together.

40:24.620 --> 40:26.250
That would be so fun.

40:26.250 --> 40:27.990
[Applause]

40:27.990 --> 40:29.390
California.

40:29.390 --> 40:30.590
[Laughter]

40:30.590 --> 40:31.890
See, I'm not like Blake.

40:31.890 --> 40:34.330
I don't ever get to use
geography to my advantage.

40:34.330 --> 40:36.560
It's 'cause you don't know
anything about geography.

40:36.560 --> 40:38.530
[Laughter]

40:38.530 --> 40:41.130
The greatness that you have
is something you can't teach.

40:41.130 --> 40:43.430
And if you have that,
then you're just adding

40:43.430 --> 40:46.970
to this incredible,
raw ability...

40:47.000 --> 40:48.240
[Crickets chirping]

40:48.240 --> 40:50.240
Are those actual crickets
I just heard?

40:50.240 --> 40:52.340
The things that you are
saying are so boring...

40:52.340 --> 40:54.510
[Laughter]

40:54.510 --> 40:56.510
Oh, man.
[Applause]

40:56.510 --> 40:58.180
Do not clap!

40:58.180 --> 40:59.320
[Laughter]

40:59.320 --> 41:01.850
Do not clap for that.
That's too funny.

41:01.850 --> 41:03.420
[Laughter]

41:03.420 --> 41:06.660
But seriously, I do believe
you could win this entire thing.

41:06.660 --> 41:08.190
Wha...

41:08.190 --> 41:09.990
Thank you so much.
That means a lot.

41:09.990 --> 41:13.400
And I'll tell you, I love
Temecula, and I love old towns.

41:13.400 --> 41:15.500
Stop pretending like you even
know what Temecula is.

41:15.500 --> 41:16.830
The wineries,
the casino there,

41:16.830 --> 41:18.570
the hot air balloon festival
they have there.

41:18.600 --> 41:19.670
That's why
you were so quiet.

41:19.670 --> 41:21.740
You were Googling that
while we were talking.

41:21.740 --> 41:23.240
[Laughter]

41:23.240 --> 41:24.740
I played
the hot air balloon festival.

41:24.740 --> 41:26.140
Oh!

41:26.140 --> 41:27.410
Yep, he did.

41:27.410 --> 41:28.950
[Laughter]
Oh, my God!

41:28.950 --> 41:31.250
I want that town
to not be known for that stuff.

41:31.250 --> 41:34.050
I want it to be known
as Anatalia's hometown.

41:34.050 --> 41:36.120
I want people to go there
and be, like,

41:36.120 --> 41:37.450
"Whoa! This is
where she's from."

41:37.450 --> 41:39.660
That's a good one.
That's what I want for you.

41:39.660 --> 41:41.960
Anatalia, tell me
what I have to say to you

41:41.960 --> 41:43.430
to get you
to be on my team?

41:43.430 --> 41:46.230
This is so hard.
This is like picking cake.

41:46.230 --> 41:47.360
Oh, my gosh.
I have cake.

41:47.360 --> 41:49.370
I have cake.
I got tons of cake backstage.

41:49.370 --> 41:51.200
Take it easy, Adam.

41:51.200 --> 41:54.070
When you tell a teenager you
have cake for them backstage...

41:54.100 --> 41:55.370
[Laughter]

41:55.410 --> 41:56.540
What is wrong with you?

41:56.540 --> 42:00.780
Anatalia, who do you
pick as your coach?

42:00.810 --> 42:02.910
Come on.

42:02.910 --> 42:05.050
Who do you pick?!

42:07.550 --> 42:09.150
It's a hard choice.

42:09.150 --> 42:11.320
[Audience shouting]

42:11.320 --> 42:12.760
Oh, man.

42:14.160 --> 42:15.860
Ahh!

42:15.860 --> 42:17.590
Come on, Anatalia!

42:17.590 --> 42:20.030
Um, I'm gonna
have to pick...

42:22.430 --> 42:23.870
...Alicia Keys.

42:23.870 --> 42:25.340
[Screams]

42:25.340 --> 42:27.470
[Cheers and applause]

42:27.500 --> 42:32.210
 That's my girl 

42:32.210 --> 42:34.810
 What you waiting for? 
Whoo!

42:34.810 --> 42:35.950
What?!

42:35.950 --> 42:37.080
Hey, wait a minute.
I want to see this.

42:37.080 --> 42:38.220
I want to see this.
Stand next to me.

42:38.220 --> 42:39.920
If I take off my heels,
I'm like right here.

42:39.920 --> 42:40.920
How's that look?

42:40.920 --> 42:42.550
[Mock crying]

42:42.550 --> 42:44.420
Alicia:
Anatalia was so amazing.

42:44.420 --> 42:46.660
She had a ton of personality,
a ton of swag

42:46.660 --> 42:49.330
that I just can't wait
for the world to see more of.

42:49.330 --> 42:50.490
Look at this girl!

42:50.490 --> 42:51.500
Certain people just have it,

42:51.500 --> 42:52.900
and she's definitely
one of them.

42:52.900 --> 42:55.130
You offered her
cake backstage.

42:55.130 --> 42:56.370
[Laughter]

42:56.370 --> 42:57.400
No, she asked for it.

42:57.400 --> 42:59.370
"Come into my dressing room.
I have cake.

42:59.400 --> 43:00.840
I have lots of cake."

43:00.840 --> 43:02.340
It's better than you.
You're, like,

43:02.340 --> 43:04.040
[imitating Blake]
"I think they should name a day

43:04.040 --> 43:05.780
after you...
Anatalia Day."

43:05.810 --> 43:07.540
[Laughter]

43:07.540 --> 43:08.610
Daly: Coming up...

43:08.610 --> 43:11.550
 So, please have mercy on me 

43:11.550 --> 43:15.020
 Call someone who cares 

43:15.020 --> 43:17.750
 Ohhhh 
Are you kidding me?

43:22.590 --> 43:24.390
Holy moly.

43:24.390 --> 43:26.160
Your voice is so dope.

43:26.160 --> 43:28.000
Don't even think about it.
I turned first.

43:28.000 --> 43:29.500
[Laughs]
Here she comes.

43:29.500 --> 43:31.330
- [Grunts]
- I'm not giving up.

43:31.330 --> 43:32.340
[Laughter]

43:33.800 --> 43:35.270
This is weird.

43:35.310 --> 43:36.540
[Blake laughs]

43:38.380 --> 43:40.180
 This is "The Voice" 

43:40.180 --> 43:41.680
Daly:
Welcome back to night one

43:41.680 --> 43:42.950
of the blind auditions.

43:42.950 --> 43:44.480
Now, let's see
if this next artist,

43:44.480 --> 43:47.250
27-year-old Stephanie Rice,
has what it takes

43:47.250 --> 43:49.090
to get our coaches' attention.

43:49.090 --> 43:50.660
Stephanie:
I grew up around music,

43:50.660 --> 43:53.430
and my dad was the pastor
of the Baptist church.

43:53.430 --> 43:55.330
When you're from a small town

43:55.330 --> 43:56.800
and you're
the preacher's daughter,

43:56.800 --> 43:59.070
you're really secluded.

43:59.070 --> 44:01.330
I remember the first time
somebody said "lesbian,"

44:01.330 --> 44:02.970
and I'm like, "What's that?"
And they were like,

44:02.970 --> 44:05.470
"Oh, it's when a girl
likes a girl

44:05.470 --> 44:07.740
in the way that girls
should like boys."

44:07.740 --> 44:08.810
It was like this epiphany.

44:08.810 --> 44:10.910
"[Gasps] Oh, that's me."

44:13.280 --> 44:15.450
Ironically, my dad
was also preaching

44:15.450 --> 44:17.550
that God did not approve,

44:17.550 --> 44:20.020
and I was terrified.

44:20.020 --> 44:24.290
I vividly remember being told
that, "You're sick."

44:26.960 --> 44:28.690
You know,
I was given an option...

44:28.690 --> 44:32.430
start going to counseling
or take me to college

44:32.430 --> 44:34.970
and drop me off, and they could
no longer affiliate with me.

44:34.970 --> 44:37.070
I would be history to them.

44:37.070 --> 44:38.940
So, I haven't had
a relationship with them

44:38.940 --> 44:40.970
in eight or nine years.

44:40.970 --> 44:43.840
I have two little sisters.

44:43.840 --> 44:46.650
I think my biggest
fear in life is...

44:46.650 --> 44:50.450
[Sighs]

44:50.450 --> 44:53.190
...that I would be
a disappointment to them,

44:53.190 --> 44:55.720
'cause I don't know
what they think about it.

44:59.060 --> 45:01.560
Ever since then,
I just never looked back.

45:01.560 --> 45:04.360
I put my head down,
and I worked extremely hard.

45:04.360 --> 45:07.600
I got a degree in biology,

45:07.600 --> 45:10.900
and I began doing research
at Baylor College of Medicine.

45:10.900 --> 45:14.340
And I started working on
a project with HIV subjects.

45:14.340 --> 45:16.480
Uh-huh.
I just became a published author

45:16.480 --> 45:19.180
in September 2015
in a scientific journal.

45:19.180 --> 45:22.250
Talented, beautiful,
and smart on top of it.

45:22.250 --> 45:24.150
Well, thank you.
Way to go.

45:24.150 --> 45:27.150
In 2013, I met my fiance.

45:27.150 --> 45:31.220
Jan was the first person that
solidified unconditional love.

45:31.220 --> 45:33.360
I couldn't be here without her.

45:33.360 --> 45:34.930
Sing from right here.

45:34.930 --> 45:37.230
The past few years,
I put science to the side,

45:37.230 --> 45:39.570
and I decided
to pursue music only.

45:39.570 --> 45:40.900
I'm going to be singing

45:40.900 --> 45:42.840
"Piece by Piece"
by Kelly Clarkson.

45:42.840 --> 45:46.210
The song, in a lot of ways,
is kind of my own story,

45:46.210 --> 45:49.180
and I'm so thrilled that today,

45:49.180 --> 45:50.740
I get to stand up on the stage

45:50.740 --> 45:53.680
and be exactly
who I was born to be.

45:59.050 --> 46:02.990
 All I remember 

46:02.990 --> 46:07.330
 Is your back 

46:09.300 --> 46:11.800
 Walkin' towards the airport 

46:11.800 --> 46:17.600
 Leaving us all in your past 

46:17.600 --> 46:23.840
 I traveled 1,500 miles
to see you 

46:26.380 --> 46:28.650
 I begged you to want me 

46:28.650 --> 46:32.450
 But you didn't want to 

46:32.450 --> 46:34.620
 But piece by piece 

46:34.620 --> 46:39.190
 He collected me
up off the ground 

46:39.190 --> 46:41.890
 Where you abandoned things 

46:41.890 --> 46:43.960
 Piece by piece 

46:43.960 --> 46:46.230
 He restores my faith 

46:46.230 --> 46:48.970
 That a man can be kind 

46:48.970 --> 46:56.040
 And a father could stay 

46:56.040 --> 46:58.040
 And piece by piece 

46:58.040 --> 47:00.080
 I fell far from the tree 

47:00.080 --> 47:04.250
 I would never leave her
like you left me 

47:04.250 --> 47:08.250
 And she will never
have to wonder her worth 

47:08.250 --> 47:12.390
 Because unlike you,
I'm gonna put her first 

47:12.390 --> 47:15.490
 And you know
he'll never walk away 

47:15.490 --> 47:17.900
 He'll never break her heart 

47:17.900 --> 47:20.030
 He'll take care of things 

47:20.030 --> 47:23.670
 He'll love her 

47:23.670 --> 47:25.340
Wow.

47:25.340 --> 47:27.670
 Piece by piece 

47:27.670 --> 47:30.510
 He'll restore my faith 

47:30.510 --> 47:33.580
 That a man can be kind 

47:33.580 --> 47:40.690
 And a father should be great 

47:40.690 --> 47:42.960
[Cheers and applause]

47:46.730 --> 47:47.760
Wow.

47:49.830 --> 47:51.130
You.

47:51.130 --> 47:52.370
[Laughs]

47:52.370 --> 47:53.670
I pushed it first.

47:53.670 --> 47:55.000
I'm gonna just
say something right now.

47:55.000 --> 47:56.070
Wow.

47:56.070 --> 47:57.840
Just 'cause you have on
a cowboy belt...

47:57.840 --> 48:00.510
[Laughs]
...please, I really want

48:00.510 --> 48:03.680
to just talk to you
for a second before he does.

48:03.680 --> 48:05.950
[Laughter]

48:05.950 --> 48:07.580
What is your name?

48:07.580 --> 48:08.880
My name is Stephanie Rice.

48:08.880 --> 48:11.580
I am 27 years old,
and I am from Texarkana, Texas.

48:11.580 --> 48:14.450
There's a new dynamic on the
show with these two going at it,

48:14.450 --> 48:16.860
and when they... No, that's...
Don't misunderstand

48:16.860 --> 48:17.860
how I said that.

48:17.860 --> 48:19.660
[Laughter]

48:19.660 --> 48:21.560
So, when they both
push sometimes,

48:21.560 --> 48:22.900
they're, like, dating,
and I don't know what to do.

48:22.900 --> 48:24.460
I'm like the third wheel
in this thing.

48:24.460 --> 48:25.560
[Laughter]

48:25.560 --> 48:28.630
But I've never seen
her like this before.

48:28.630 --> 48:30.270
Pay very close attention
to what this

48:30.270 --> 48:32.610
lovely, incredible woman
has to say to you.

48:32.610 --> 48:33.870
- Thank you.
- Say something good.

48:33.870 --> 48:35.810
Say something good.
Okay. Watch.

48:35.810 --> 48:38.280
[Laughter]

48:38.280 --> 48:39.580
Stephanie.

48:39.580 --> 48:40.880
Stefani, so...

48:40.880 --> 48:42.650
[Laughter]
Right.

48:42.650 --> 48:45.250
Honestly, I was
really moved by you.

48:45.250 --> 48:47.550
I could feel whatever
pain is in there.

48:47.550 --> 48:49.690
There is music
as an outlet for you.

48:49.690 --> 48:51.090
That's exactly right.

48:51.090 --> 48:53.930
Gwen: So, you can only sing like
that if you've lived it.

48:53.930 --> 48:55.900
Sometimes on this show,
I get really emotional

48:55.900 --> 48:57.700
because I feel like
I'm here for a reason.

48:57.700 --> 49:00.200
And right now, I feel like
I'm here to work with you.

49:00.200 --> 49:01.900
Blake is one of
the most talented,

49:01.900 --> 49:03.370
awesome guys I've ever met,

49:03.370 --> 49:05.870
and you're probably
going to do country music,

49:05.870 --> 49:07.970
but I would really
love to work with you.

49:07.970 --> 49:09.180
[Applause]
Thank you.

49:09.180 --> 49:10.740
Why did I let her
talk first?!

49:10.740 --> 49:12.550
[Laughs]
I feel like the passion

49:12.550 --> 49:15.480
that just came from Gwen
was, like, so sincere.

49:15.480 --> 49:17.080
[Laughter]

49:17.080 --> 49:18.950
I'm not taking anything
away from anyone.
Thanks, homey.

49:18.950 --> 49:21.020
Yes, you did!
You just did!

49:21.020 --> 49:23.620
You took it away from me
and put it on her.

49:23.620 --> 49:26.090
I just felt that was
really a beautiful moment

49:26.090 --> 49:28.190
right there that
shouldn't be... be ignored.

49:28.190 --> 49:30.660
Very perceptive, Alicia.
I noticed the same thing.

49:30.660 --> 49:33.830
[Laughter]

49:33.830 --> 49:35.070
Blake, take it away.

49:35.070 --> 49:36.300
[Laughter]

49:36.300 --> 49:38.570
[Imitating Blake]
"Where are you from?"

49:38.570 --> 49:40.140
Oh, my God, Adam.

49:40.140 --> 49:41.670
"I want to protect you."

49:41.670 --> 49:44.910
[Laughter]

49:44.910 --> 49:46.880
It's clearly
three against one here.

49:46.880 --> 49:48.580
But I will say this.

49:48.580 --> 49:51.780
The way you sing that song,
it's as if you wrote it.

49:51.780 --> 49:53.420
Yeah, um...
What's the...

49:53.420 --> 49:54.990
When I was 18,
I came out to my parents,

49:54.990 --> 49:58.220
and my dad's a pastor, and...

49:58.220 --> 50:01.060
they disowned me,
and I've been taking that

50:01.060 --> 50:03.600
brokenness and the emotion,
and I've been channeling it

50:03.600 --> 50:05.800
into the only form that I knew
how, which is through music.

50:05.800 --> 50:07.470
Mm.

50:07.470 --> 50:08.900
[Applause]

50:08.900 --> 50:10.000
Mm.

50:11.600 --> 50:13.170
Yes.

50:13.170 --> 50:14.710
Well, you know what?

50:14.710 --> 50:15.940
They're gonna realize
they missed out on

50:15.940 --> 50:17.940
some pretty important
stuff.

50:17.940 --> 50:20.650
Maybe this will
bring them around.

50:20.650 --> 50:23.150
[Applause]

50:23.150 --> 50:26.520
So, she mentioned that
you want to do country music.

50:26.520 --> 50:27.720
I didn't hear that.

50:27.720 --> 50:30.120
I've always kind of
called it folk/soul/rock.

50:30.120 --> 50:33.690
Well, I'm a... I'm a folky kind
of guy, I got to tell you.

50:33.690 --> 50:35.260
And I do have a soul.

50:35.260 --> 50:36.500
Uh, debatable.

50:36.500 --> 50:38.300
[Laughter]

50:38.300 --> 50:41.130
Here's the deal.
I would love to work with you,

50:41.130 --> 50:44.070
but I think you've already
probably made your decision,

50:44.070 --> 50:45.440
and I'm good with it.

50:45.440 --> 50:46.640
I just need
to check one thing,

50:46.640 --> 50:48.270
'cause it's really important
to me that I know.

50:48.270 --> 50:49.840
I'm very worried.
I just want to...

50:49.840 --> 50:51.910
[Laughter]

50:51.910 --> 50:54.980
I thought you were gonna
make sure I was drinking.

50:54.980 --> 50:56.080
I am.

50:56.080 --> 50:58.150
It's like I don't
even know you anymore.

50:58.150 --> 50:59.350
[Laughter]
I know.

50:59.350 --> 51:00.750
I don't want to
slow-play this.

51:00.750 --> 51:04.090
Stephanie, I would freak out
if you picked me as your coach.

51:04.090 --> 51:05.360
Are we good?

51:05.360 --> 51:07.290
I'm good. I'm happy
with any decision you make.

51:07.290 --> 51:09.230
Stephanie...
I'm not.
I want her to pick me.

51:09.230 --> 51:13.100
...it's time for you
to pick a coach.

51:13.100 --> 51:16.070
[Audience shouting]

51:24.210 --> 51:26.950
I love you both so much.

51:28.580 --> 51:31.180
[Audience shouting]

51:32.790 --> 51:33.720
I pick Gwen.

51:33.720 --> 51:37.320
 Baby, you're a firework 

51:37.320 --> 51:41.330
 Come on,
let your colors burst 

51:41.330 --> 51:43.230
 Make 'em go oh, oh, oh 

51:43.230 --> 51:44.560
Gwen: Stephanie Rice.

51:44.560 --> 51:46.400
Something in her voice
told her story,

51:46.400 --> 51:48.730
and I can completely
relate to that.

51:48.730 --> 51:50.070
I already have two people.

51:50.070 --> 51:52.000
When I look at each
one of them individually,

51:52.000 --> 51:54.140
I feel like, yeah,
they're supposed to be with me.

51:54.140 --> 51:55.610
- So, I love it.
- Thank you for turning.

51:55.610 --> 51:57.410
- Thank you.
- Oh, my God. You're amazing.

51:57.410 --> 52:00.280
You know, Stephanie
was a moment for this show

52:00.280 --> 52:02.180
that I think we'll all remember.

52:02.180 --> 52:04.650
I'll definitely be waiting
to steal her, if I can.

52:04.650 --> 52:07.920
 Baby, you're a firework 
Team Gwen.

52:07.920 --> 52:12.190
 Come and show 'em
what you're worth 

52:12.190 --> 52:15.430
 Make 'em go 
You did it, all right.

52:15.430 --> 52:17.530
 As you shoot across the sky 

52:17.530 --> 52:19.000
Welcome to the show.

52:19.000 --> 52:20.230
[Applause]

52:21.600 --> 52:23.200
Can you gloat?
Just gloat.

52:23.200 --> 52:25.540
It was like a cowboy
that, like, got off the horse

52:25.540 --> 52:27.110
and like just
walked away like that.

52:27.110 --> 52:28.340
I was like...

52:28.340 --> 52:29.340
Do you see like
the Wild West

52:29.340 --> 52:30.580
where he was
just like this.

52:30.580 --> 52:32.310
He's like this. He's like...
He's like... He's like...

52:32.310 --> 52:34.680
[Theme from "The Good, the Bad
and the Ugly" plays]

52:37.250 --> 52:41.220
[Laughter]

52:44.460 --> 52:46.560
 This is "The Voice" 

52:47.200 --> 52:48.760
Daly: Welcome back.

52:48.760 --> 52:50.170
Hey, Blake.

52:50.170 --> 52:51.230
You know what song
I feel

52:51.230 --> 52:52.470
is playing
in your head all the time?

52:52.470 --> 52:53.600
What song?

52:53.600 --> 52:57.040
[Imitating
banjo playing]

52:57.040 --> 52:58.540
What the hell song is that?

52:59.940 --> 53:01.640
[Engine starts]

53:03.580 --> 53:04.780
I'm Brandon Martin,

53:04.780 --> 53:06.650
I'm 25, and I'm from
Owingsville, Kentucky.

53:06.650 --> 53:08.050
[Horse whinnies]

53:11.220 --> 53:13.920
It's a pretty small town.
There's about 1,700 people.

53:13.920 --> 53:17.660
We got two stoplights,
and only one of 'em works.

53:17.660 --> 53:20.160
It's a pretty close community.

53:21.900 --> 53:25.100
When Branden was about 14,
I got him his first guitar,

53:25.100 --> 53:28.100
and then he could go
in his room and listen to a song

53:28.100 --> 53:29.870
on the radio,
and a couple hours later,

53:29.870 --> 53:31.570
he would come out
and pick it for us

53:31.570 --> 53:34.010
and do a very good job
at it.

53:35.080 --> 53:37.480
After high school,
I tried to go into

53:37.480 --> 53:41.050
a trade school about a year,
and I had to quit and get a job.

53:41.050 --> 53:42.990
[Chainsaw buzzes]

53:42.990 --> 53:45.320
I've welded in factories
and worked in sawmills

53:45.320 --> 53:48.920
and built fences,
and I'm pretty handy.

53:51.660 --> 53:53.300
When I'm not working
on the farm,

53:53.300 --> 53:55.330
I spend a lot of time
playing with the band,

53:55.330 --> 53:57.370
Branden Martin
and the Sour Mash.

53:57.370 --> 54:01.340
We're a mixture of traditional
country and Southern rock.

54:01.340 --> 54:03.470
We play the bar scene
around here,

54:03.470 --> 54:06.440
so "The Voice" is
a big opportunity for me

54:06.440 --> 54:10.650
because, you know, it gives me a
chance to jump-start my career.

54:13.250 --> 54:15.380
If I could pick any coach,
I would probably pick

54:15.380 --> 54:19.590
Blake Shelton because he's got
roots in the same area as I do,

54:19.590 --> 54:22.090
so I believe
he'd be able to help me.

54:22.090 --> 54:24.060
I feel at home on stage,

54:24.060 --> 54:27.000
and I'm gonna show
these coaches everything I got.

54:27.000 --> 54:28.800
Here comes Branden.
There he is.

54:41.680 --> 54:47.550
 You say you were wrong
to ever leave me alone 

54:47.550 --> 54:52.650
 Now you're sorry,
you're lonesome and scared 

54:53.890 --> 54:57.090
 And you say you'd be happy 

54:57.090 --> 55:00.300
 If you could
just come back home 

55:00.300 --> 55:02.000
 Here's a quarter 

55:02.000 --> 55:05.730
 Call someone who cares 

55:06.840 --> 55:09.810
 Call someone who'll listen 

55:09.810 --> 55:13.180
 And might give a damn 

55:13.180 --> 55:18.350
 Maybe one of
your sordid affairs 

55:19.380 --> 55:23.420
 But don't you come
'round here handing me 

55:23.420 --> 55:25.790
 None of your lines 

55:25.790 --> 55:27.520
 Here's a quarter 

55:27.520 --> 55:31.060
 Call someone who cares 

55:31.060 --> 55:33.830
 Yeah, here's a quarter 

55:33.830 --> 55:37.870
 Call someone who cares 

55:37.870 --> 55:39.130
Let's go, let's go,
let's go!

55:39.130 --> 55:44.470
 Yeah, yeah 

55:44.470 --> 55:46.980
[Cheers and applause]

55:55.350 --> 55:56.720
How you doing?

55:56.720 --> 55:58.020
I'm doing all right.
How are y'all?

55:58.020 --> 55:59.450
He gonna
whup your ass.

55:59.450 --> 56:00.960
[Laughter]

56:00.960 --> 56:02.960
Oh, my God. Please do.
Please do.

56:02.960 --> 56:04.690
What's your name?
I'm Branden Martin.

56:04.690 --> 56:07.130
I'm 25, and I'm from
Owingsville, Kentucky.

56:07.130 --> 56:09.730
Wow.
Your accent is crazy.
Wow. That's...
That's country.

56:09.730 --> 56:12.200
Branden is so country,
like, you make Blake look like

56:12.200 --> 56:13.470
he's not that country.

56:13.470 --> 56:14.700
Yeah.
[Laughter]

56:14.700 --> 56:16.810
- You're such a poser, Blake.
- Yeah, totally.

56:16.810 --> 56:18.670
You are exposing me
right now, man.

56:18.670 --> 56:20.540
What are you doing,
Branden?

56:20.540 --> 56:22.110
First of all,
I love your song choice.

56:22.110 --> 56:23.680
Travis Tritt's
one of my heroes.

56:23.680 --> 56:26.550
And, man, when you hit
that growl, it's so good.

56:26.550 --> 56:28.450
I tell you, the thing
that I heard was

56:28.450 --> 56:31.350
you sing sharp
just at the end of your phrases,

56:31.350 --> 56:34.420
and it made me
second-guess hitting my button,

56:34.420 --> 56:36.460
but you're a really
good singer, man.

56:36.460 --> 56:38.460
- Thank you.
- We didn't need verification

56:38.460 --> 56:41.060
from anybody as to whether
or not you were authentic,

56:41.060 --> 56:42.760
and I think that
that is super cool.

56:42.760 --> 56:44.470
Unfortunately,
I found myself doing

56:44.470 --> 56:45.970
the stupid thing
that I'm trying to stop doing,

56:45.970 --> 56:48.140
which is looking over there
at Cowboy Dimples.

56:48.140 --> 56:49.810
[Laughter]

56:49.810 --> 56:52.110
And I think that
if you could deliver it

56:52.110 --> 56:53.980
with slightly more
conviction.

56:53.980 --> 56:56.040
Just a little bit
of command.

56:56.040 --> 56:58.350
Yeah, I think that that would
have been the difference.

56:58.350 --> 57:00.750
Come back again
because you're this close.

57:00.750 --> 57:02.250
Thank y'all.

57:02.250 --> 57:05.250
[Cheers and applause]

57:05.250 --> 57:06.460
Appreciate it.

57:06.460 --> 57:08.220
Good to meet you, Branden.
Yes, sir.

57:08.220 --> 57:11.060
Branden had a unique voice,
and I think it was probably

57:11.060 --> 57:12.260
just about
a little bit more time,

57:12.260 --> 57:13.760
a little bit more experience.

57:13.760 --> 57:16.260
I'm not afraid to go
up after a country artist.

57:16.260 --> 57:17.830
I am looking for at least one,

57:17.830 --> 57:20.300
and I'm gonna wait
until it comes.

57:20.300 --> 57:21.700
- Coming up...
- I'm trying to help Alicia

57:21.700 --> 57:22.940
'cause she doesn't
know anything

57:22.940 --> 57:24.510
about country music,
so...

57:24.510 --> 57:26.310
You're gonna have to
fight, Alicia.

57:26.310 --> 57:27.410
Kick it!

57:27.410 --> 57:29.140
Well, I didn't slap her
on television.

57:29.140 --> 57:30.650
[Laughter]
What are you...
What the...

57:30.650 --> 57:32.180
My name was Felicia Keys

57:32.180 --> 57:34.580
'cause I played all her songs
at the talent shows.

57:34.580 --> 57:37.620
Nobody has ever said,
"I was Jake Shelton."

57:37.620 --> 57:40.120
[Laughter]

57:40.400 --> 57:42.330
 This is "The Voice" 

57:42.560 --> 57:45.700
Daly: Welcome back
to the blind auditions.

57:45.700 --> 57:47.800
Hey, uh, Blake, the other day,
I made myself

57:47.800 --> 57:48.900
a peanut butter
and jelly sandwich.

57:48.900 --> 57:50.170
All by yourself?

57:50.170 --> 57:53.640
And I had it on this
really tasty white bread.

57:53.640 --> 57:54.780
[Laughs]

57:54.780 --> 57:56.810
Do all of those people
from Oklahoma,

57:56.810 --> 57:58.080
do they say "white"?

57:58.080 --> 57:59.910
Is it "white,"
or is it "wheat"?

57:59.910 --> 58:01.450
[Laughter]

58:01.450 --> 58:04.920
Look at how hard
he's laughing at me.

58:04.920 --> 58:07.390
Daly:
Now let's meet our next artist.

58:07.390 --> 58:09.490
My name is Mark Isaiah.
I'm 19 years old.

58:09.490 --> 58:10.830
I am from New York,

58:10.860 --> 58:12.990
but I currently live
in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania.

58:12.990 --> 58:14.060
[Drumming]

58:14.060 --> 58:15.760
Dance a little salsa.

58:15.760 --> 58:17.370
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

58:17.370 --> 58:18.570
Today, I brought

58:18.570 --> 58:20.540
my dad, my mom,
and my little brother, Roby.

58:20.540 --> 58:22.040
With Roby,
I definitely share music.

58:22.040 --> 58:23.440
I'm always taking him
to the piano.

58:23.440 --> 58:24.540
I'm always playing
around with him.

58:24.540 --> 58:25.870
You know,
that's my little man.

58:34.550 --> 58:36.450
- [Laughs]
- Nice.

58:36.450 --> 58:39.320
I remember actually being into
music at a really young age,

58:39.320 --> 58:40.990
but I was always nervous.

58:40.990 --> 58:44.030
I was overweight, and it was
just a really hard time for me.

58:44.060 --> 58:48.160
Here you are seeing
this beautiful, talented boy,

58:48.160 --> 58:50.230
but yet, he doesn't
believe in himself.

58:50.230 --> 58:51.770
Mark:
When I was 14 years old,

58:51.770 --> 58:53.500
I found out about
this Justin Bieber contest

58:53.500 --> 58:55.200
for his "Never Say Never"
movie premiere.

58:55.200 --> 58:57.040
I was really hesitant
about going.

58:57.040 --> 58:59.970
I learned the song "Baby"
the night before,

58:59.970 --> 59:02.680
and once I got on that stage
and started singing,

59:02.680 --> 59:04.680
everybody was, like,
"Whoa, yeah, yeah."

59:04.680 --> 59:06.310
It was just so awesome.

59:06.310 --> 59:08.820
I won the contest
and made me rethink,

59:08.820 --> 59:11.650
you know, what I was thinking
about myself.

59:13.720 --> 59:16.220
Once I got to college,
I lost 40 pounds.

59:16.260 --> 59:18.390
Losing weight definitely
made me feel more confident.

59:18.390 --> 59:21.900
Now this is a chance
to show that I'm a new person.

59:21.900 --> 59:23.570
I'm ready to do this.

59:23.570 --> 59:24.670
Here we go.

59:35.440 --> 59:38.410
 Ooh, ooh, ooh 

59:38.410 --> 59:41.920
 Ooh, ooh 

59:41.920 --> 59:45.320
 You've got ahold of me 

59:45.350 --> 59:48.490
 Don't even know your power 

59:48.490 --> 59:51.560
 I stand 100 feet 

59:51.560 --> 59:54.860
 But I fall
when I'm around you 

59:54.860 --> 59:58.100
 Show me an open door 

59:58.100 --> 01:00:01.240
 Then you go
and slam it on me 

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:04.440
 I can't take any more 

01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:09.540
 I'm saying, baby,
please have mercy on me 

01:00:09.540 --> 01:00:12.880
 Take it easy on my heart 

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:16.150
Whoo!
 Even though you
don't mean to hurt me 

01:00:16.150 --> 01:00:20.220
 You keep tearing me apart 

01:00:20.250 --> 01:00:23.520
 Consuming all the air
inside my lungs 

01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:26.730
 Ripping all the skin
from off my bones 

01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:29.730
 I'm prepared
to sacrifice my life 

01:00:29.730 --> 01:00:32.130
 I would gladly do it twice 

01:00:33.100 --> 01:00:36.200
Wow.
 I'm prepared
to sacrifice my life 

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:39.440
 I would gladly do it twice 

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:43.510
 So, please have mercy on me 

01:00:43.510 --> 01:00:47.150
 I'm a puppet on your string 

01:00:47.150 --> 01:00:50.120
 You've got good intentions 

01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:53.420
 I need you to set me free 

01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:56.420
 I'm begging you for mercy 

01:00:56.460 --> 01:00:57.930
 Mercy 

01:00:57.960 --> 01:01:00.900
 Begging you, begging you,
please, baby 

01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:03.360
 Mercy, oh 

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:06.570
 Please have mercy on me 

01:01:06.570 --> 01:01:10.210
 Yeah 

01:01:10.210 --> 01:01:13.880
[Cheers and applause]

01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:21.820
That kid's a star.

01:01:21.820 --> 01:01:23.020
Thank you.
Straight up.

01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:24.420
Thank you.

01:01:24.450 --> 01:01:26.190
What... Oh, you... Oh, you...
Yeah.

01:01:26.190 --> 01:01:27.890
Just don't even
think about it.

01:01:27.890 --> 01:01:30.390
Don't even think about it.
I turned first, okay?

01:01:30.390 --> 01:01:31.660
This is crazy.

01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:33.390
Hey, brother,
what's your name?

01:01:33.390 --> 01:01:35.200
Mark Isaiah. I'm 19.

01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:37.200
And I'm from
Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania.

01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:38.930
- Wow!
- Same age as me.

01:01:38.930 --> 01:01:40.170
[Laughter]

01:01:40.170 --> 01:01:41.900
I honestly can't believe
you're not signed already.

01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:44.310
Thank you so much.
Your voice sounds so modern.

01:01:44.310 --> 01:01:45.570
It sounds like radio.

01:01:45.570 --> 01:01:47.140
I feel like because
I have a little boy

01:01:47.140 --> 01:01:48.910
that listens to
a lot of music,

01:01:48.910 --> 01:01:51.110
I recognize you from the music
that I hear at my house,

01:01:51.110 --> 01:01:53.880
and, wow, your parents
must be so proud of you.

01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:56.380
Wow.
Incredible.

01:01:56.380 --> 01:01:58.090
I've had the longest
career out of...

01:01:58.090 --> 01:01:59.320
He used to come
to my shows, okay?

01:01:59.350 --> 01:02:00.490
I did.
[Laughter]

01:02:00.490 --> 01:02:01.790
I did do that.

01:02:01.790 --> 01:02:04.390
If you come on my team,
I will do everything I can

01:02:04.390 --> 01:02:05.690
to share
what I've learned.

01:02:05.690 --> 01:02:08.600
Whoo! I need you on my team.
Oh, my God!

01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:10.630
[Applause]

01:02:10.630 --> 01:02:12.100
Here she comes.

01:02:12.100 --> 01:02:13.600
I want you guys to talk,
so talk,

01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:15.170
'cause I got so much
to say to Mark

01:02:15.170 --> 01:02:16.940
that I don't want
to get interrupted, so...

01:02:16.940 --> 01:02:17.970
[Laughter]
I'll be right here.

01:02:17.970 --> 01:02:19.610
I'm coming.
Get ready to be bored.

01:02:19.610 --> 01:02:21.810
[Laughter]

01:02:21.810 --> 01:02:23.640
Your voice is so dope.

01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:25.410
You have a lot of
emotion in you,

01:02:25.410 --> 01:02:27.250
and it really, really
was amazing,

01:02:27.250 --> 01:02:29.250
and I'm so glad
that you're on the show.

01:02:29.250 --> 01:02:30.320
Mark: Thank you so much.
Thank you.

01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:32.120
Yeah.

01:02:32.150 --> 01:02:34.720
I just think that you're meant
to be on Gwen's team.

01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:35.890
[Laughter]

01:02:35.890 --> 01:02:37.490
- Wow.
- Of course you do.

01:02:37.490 --> 01:02:39.130
You have no choice
but to think that.

01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:40.460
[Gwen laughs] No.

01:02:40.460 --> 01:02:43.930
Mark, it's so obvious
that you belong

01:02:43.930 --> 01:02:46.730
in the current landscape
of pop music.

01:02:46.730 --> 01:02:48.870
Every single person in here
probably felt like it was

01:02:48.870 --> 01:02:50.270
an awards show
or something like that.

01:02:50.270 --> 01:02:51.540
What's your deal?
Do you perform?

01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:52.840
What are you...
What are you doing here?

01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:54.910
I was, you know, struggling
with being overweight,

01:02:54.910 --> 01:02:57.010
so I never realty experienced

01:02:57.010 --> 01:02:59.350
performing out, you know,
like this.

01:02:59.350 --> 01:03:00.450
Wow, man.
But now that I'm here,

01:03:00.450 --> 01:03:01.950
you know, this is so great.

01:03:01.950 --> 01:03:04.120
I cannot believe this.
Dude, congratulations.

01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:05.720
[Cheers and applause]
Yeah.

01:03:07.150 --> 01:03:09.820
This show is so incredible
because just you saying that

01:03:09.860 --> 01:03:12.030
and being honest about it,
you know how many little boys

01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:13.460
are gonna be, like,
"I want to be like that guy.

01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:14.630
Lookit. He's on
'The Voice' right now

01:03:14.630 --> 01:03:15.730
talking to Gwen Stefani.

01:03:15.730 --> 01:03:17.160
He's gonna be on
Gwen Stefani's team.

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:19.670
What is happening?
This is crazy."

01:03:19.670 --> 01:03:20.970
[Applause]

01:03:20.970 --> 01:03:24.040
She's beautiful, and she's
talented, but she's also taken.

01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:25.570
You know, she's Blake's
girlfriend, so...

01:03:25.570 --> 01:03:26.710
Oh, please.

01:03:26.710 --> 01:03:28.380
I still think
that the right choice

01:03:28.380 --> 01:03:30.540
is the less-attractive version
right here.

01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:32.050
[Laughter]

01:03:32.050 --> 01:03:34.020
[Cheers and applause]
Oh, man.

01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:35.380
It's time to
pick a coach, man.

01:03:35.380 --> 01:03:37.820
[Audience shouting]

01:03:38.750 --> 01:03:40.520
Gwen.
Come on.

01:03:40.550 --> 01:03:42.090
- I have to say Adam.
- Adam?

01:03:42.090 --> 01:03:43.090
- Gwen!
- Adam.

01:03:43.090 --> 01:03:44.090
- Adam.
- Adam.

01:03:46.690 --> 01:03:48.300
Dude.

01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:51.900
Gwen!

01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:54.900
Thank you for this opportunity,
and I'm looking forward

01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:57.270
to learning way more
with you guys.

01:03:57.270 --> 01:03:58.610
Come on, Mark.

01:04:00.370 --> 01:04:01.880
I'm gonna have to
pick Adam.

01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:03.480
Yeah!

01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:05.480
[Cheers and applause]

01:04:08.650 --> 01:04:10.580
Oh.

01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:12.120
That's what
I'm talking about.

01:04:12.150 --> 01:04:14.090
Adam:
Mark... that guy is just a star.

01:04:14.090 --> 01:04:16.820
I can't explain it. I think
he's gonna have a lot of fans.

01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:18.630
I'm so pumped to have
Mark on my team.

01:04:18.660 --> 01:04:20.460
Here we go!

01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:21.630
[Grunts]

01:04:21.630 --> 01:04:22.960
He's so good.

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:26.870
Just don't talk to me.

01:04:26.870 --> 01:04:28.540
What'd I do?

01:04:28.540 --> 01:04:29.900
He's so stupid.

01:04:29.900 --> 01:04:33.040
 Sexual healing is something 

01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:34.980
Daly: You can buy
full versions of tonight's

01:04:34.980 --> 01:04:36.210
blind-audition songs
on iTunes...

01:04:36.210 --> 01:04:38.180
 You better
run, run, run away 

01:04:38.180 --> 01:04:39.650
 Run away, baby 

01:04:39.650 --> 01:04:41.250
Daly: ...or listen to them
on Apple Music.

01:04:41.250 --> 01:04:47.520
 Try a little tenderness 

01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:48.390
 You got to... 

01:04:48.390 --> 01:04:49.390
 This is "The Voice" 
 You got to... 

01:04:49.390 --> 01:04:50.500
 This is "The Voice" 

01:04:51.230 --> 01:04:52.660
Daly: Welcome back.

01:04:52.660 --> 01:04:55.030
This is what I'm noticing,
is Gwen's play...

01:04:55.030 --> 01:04:57.370
circling around
destiny and journeys.

01:04:57.370 --> 01:04:58.270
Oh, yeah.

01:04:58.270 --> 01:04:59.270
But we all know Blake's secret.

01:04:59.270 --> 01:05:00.510
What?

01:05:00.510 --> 01:05:01.910
[Imitating Blake]
Country, country, country.

01:05:01.910 --> 01:05:03.110
County, country,
country, country.

01:05:03.110 --> 01:05:05.040
Here's what I feel.
[Laughter]

01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:07.580
Adam only has people on his team
because he's a liar.

01:05:07.580 --> 01:05:09.680
Alicia only has people
on her team because

01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:11.050
they feel sorry for her...
What?!

01:05:11.050 --> 01:05:13.720
...about how terrible she did
last year as a coach.

01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:16.050
And you only have people on your
team because I'm letting you.

01:05:16.050 --> 01:05:17.060
Oh, okay.

01:05:17.060 --> 01:05:18.220
Now let's get to work.

01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:20.830
[Laughter]

01:05:20.830 --> 01:05:23.800
Daly:
Let's meet one of the youngest
artists in the competition...

01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:27.070
14-year-old Brennley Brown
from Apple Valley, California.

01:05:27.070 --> 01:05:28.770
I am a huge fan of "The Voice,"

01:05:28.770 --> 01:05:32.170
so to be here today,
like, I can't...

01:05:32.170 --> 01:05:35.070
I'm so, so excited.

01:05:35.070 --> 01:05:39.040
I grew up on a ranch
with horses and dogs,

01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:40.980
and I have
a lot of chores at home.

01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:43.550
Feeding the dogs, clean out
the pens of the horses,

01:05:43.550 --> 01:05:45.150
which is yucky,

01:05:45.150 --> 01:05:48.420
but it's really taught me
a lot of responsibility, also.

01:05:48.420 --> 01:05:49.720
What got you
into singing?

01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:52.220
My dad really just introduced me
into country music.

01:05:52.220 --> 01:05:55.260
At 6 years old, I did
my kindergarten talent show.

01:05:55.260 --> 01:05:58.660
I sang "Mississippi Girl"
by Faith Hill.

01:05:58.660 --> 01:06:00.600
Misty: She threw
her cowboy hat into the crowd,

01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:01.870
and I think at that moment,
we were kind of like,

01:06:01.870 --> 01:06:03.570
"Yeah, I think...
Uh-oh, we're
in for it now.

01:06:03.570 --> 01:06:04.640
[Laughter]

01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:05.970
I think she found
what she loves, yeah.

01:06:05.970 --> 01:06:07.240
Yeah.

01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:09.370
Brennley: Season 12,
"The Voice" lowered the age

01:06:09.370 --> 01:06:12.080
from 15 years old to 13.

01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:14.580
Before this, I could
not have this opportunity,

01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:17.580
and I've been watching this show
since I was 8 years old,

01:06:17.580 --> 01:06:20.850
so I am a little bit nervous,
but getting a chair turn,

01:06:20.850 --> 01:06:22.790
it would be one of the biggest
moments of my life.

01:06:22.790 --> 01:06:24.420
There she is.
There's sissy.

01:06:24.420 --> 01:06:26.420
- There's sissy.
- Ah!

01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:42.370
 She was precious
like a flower 

01:06:42.370 --> 01:06:47.280
 She grew wild, wild 

01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:50.780
 But innocent 

01:06:50.780 --> 01:06:55.590
 A perfect prayer
in a desperate hour 

01:06:55.590 --> 01:07:00.460
 She was everything
beautiful 

01:07:00.460 --> 01:07:02.390
 And different 

01:07:02.390 --> 01:07:06.030
 Stupid boy 

01:07:06.030 --> 01:07:09.400
 You can't fence that in 

01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:12.340
 Stupid boy 

01:07:12.340 --> 01:07:15.910
 It's like holding back
the wind 

01:07:15.910 --> 01:07:22.350
 She laid her heart and soul
right in his hands 

01:07:22.350 --> 01:07:24.750
 He stole her every dream 

01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:28.650
 And he crushed her plans 

01:07:28.650 --> 01:07:32.390
 She never even knew
she had a choice 

01:07:32.390 --> 01:07:37.300
 That's what happens
when the only voice she hears 

01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:41.030
 Is telling her she can't 

01:07:41.030 --> 01:07:44.570
 You stupid boy 

01:07:44.570 --> 01:07:46.070
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

01:07:46.070 --> 01:07:48.440
 You always had to be right 

01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:51.010
 And now you lost
the only thing 

01:07:51.010 --> 01:08:01.550
 That ever made you
feel alive 

01:08:01.550 --> 01:08:03.690
 Just the same old 

01:08:03.690 --> 01:08:11.330
 Same old stupid boy 

01:08:11.330 --> 01:08:13.670
Blake: Yeah!

01:08:13.670 --> 01:08:15.730
[Cheers and applause]

01:08:15.730 --> 01:08:17.970
Oh, my God!

01:08:17.970 --> 01:08:19.340
Yes!

01:08:19.340 --> 01:08:20.910
Whoo!

01:08:22.470 --> 01:08:24.710
Alicia: Whoo!

01:08:24.710 --> 01:08:26.180
What is your name?

01:08:26.180 --> 01:08:28.380
My name is Brennley Brown.

01:08:28.380 --> 01:08:32.450
I am 14 years old, and I am from
Apple Valley, California.

01:08:32.450 --> 01:08:34.290
Wow.
Yeah!

01:08:34.290 --> 01:08:35.920
- Thank you!
- The Californians.

01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:38.890
Oh, my gosh. I'm so excited.

01:08:38.890 --> 01:08:40.830
So, who is
your inspiration?

01:08:40.830 --> 01:08:44.430
I grew up with Willie Nelson,
Waylon Jennings, Merle Haggard,

01:08:44.430 --> 01:08:46.760
the Highwaymen,
Faith Hill, just...
Uh-oh.
Mm.

01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:48.029
Holy moly.

01:08:48.029 --> 01:08:49.270
[Laughter]

01:08:49.270 --> 01:08:50.340
Now we're talkin'.

01:08:50.340 --> 01:08:51.640
You're gonna have to
fight, Alicia.

01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:53.040
All right,
I'm not afraid to fight.

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:54.609
None of that was
good news for you, Alicia,

01:08:54.609 --> 01:08:56.439
but that is not... that is not
insurmountable, okay?

01:08:56.439 --> 01:08:57.810
Kick it.

01:08:57.810 --> 01:08:58.910
[Cheers and applause]

01:08:58.910 --> 01:09:01.750
Okay.
Go ahead, Blake.

01:09:01.750 --> 01:09:04.649
That's a Keith Urban song,
Alicia.

01:09:04.649 --> 01:09:06.450
[Laughter]

01:09:06.450 --> 01:09:09.649
But it was written by a girl
by the name of Sarah Buxton,

01:09:09.649 --> 01:09:11.420
Alicia.

01:09:11.420 --> 01:09:13.120
I'm trying to help Alicia
'cause she doesn't know

01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:15.430
anything about country music,
so anyway.

01:09:15.430 --> 01:09:16.830
[Audience groans]

01:09:16.830 --> 01:09:18.729
Well, I didn't slap her
on television.

01:09:18.729 --> 01:09:20.630
[Laughter]
What are you...
What the...

01:09:20.630 --> 01:09:23.000
If there is somebody else
up and down this line

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.700
who can help make
your mark on country music,

01:09:25.700 --> 01:09:27.310
I don't know who else...

01:09:27.310 --> 01:09:31.140
No, no,
and absolutely not.

01:09:31.140 --> 01:09:32.810
[Laughter]

01:09:32.810 --> 01:09:36.149
Brennley, you know, I was 14,
as well, when I first started.

01:09:36.149 --> 01:09:39.649
I don't know how old Blake was.

01:09:39.649 --> 01:09:41.350
But I'm pretty sure
he was pretty old.

01:09:41.350 --> 01:09:43.149
I feel like Blake's
always been 38.

01:09:43.149 --> 01:09:45.160
[Laughter]

01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:46.790
I'll take that now.

01:09:46.790 --> 01:09:50.960
I understand how hard it is
as a young woman artist.

01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:54.400
It's even harder than
Blake would ever know.

01:09:54.400 --> 01:10:01.070
And to me, country
and soul music are sisters.

01:10:01.070 --> 01:10:02.370
Ooh.

01:10:02.370 --> 01:10:04.640
I just did, if you recall,

01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:08.650
the ACMs with Cam
honoring Little Big Town.

01:10:08.650 --> 01:10:11.380
- Yes.
- So, real music

01:10:11.380 --> 01:10:15.890
transcends boxes.

01:10:15.890 --> 01:10:17.920
So, I don't want you
stuck in a box.

01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:20.630
'Cause, look,
I know Blake Shelton, too,

01:10:20.630 --> 01:10:22.690
so it doesn't...
You don't have to go to Blake.

01:10:22.690 --> 01:10:25.130
You can come to me,
and we can still talk to Blake.

01:10:25.130 --> 01:10:27.230
I want to remind you
that this is a competition.

01:10:27.230 --> 01:10:28.730
I'm not gonna help you.

01:10:28.730 --> 01:10:30.030
[Laughter]

01:10:30.030 --> 01:10:31.240
Yes, you are.
Yes, he is.

01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:32.940
What you talking about?
He just told me

01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:34.310
that I'm his favorite person

01:10:34.310 --> 01:10:35.670
second to Gwen, of course.

01:10:35.670 --> 01:10:37.080
[Laughter]

01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:40.410
Brennley, I would like
to say that I have never been

01:10:40.410 --> 01:10:43.280
a guest artist
at a country concert

01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:45.680
because I am
the country concert.

01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:47.490
[Cheers and applause]

01:10:47.490 --> 01:10:48.590
Wait a minute.

01:10:48.590 --> 01:10:50.390
You don't want
most people as possible

01:10:50.390 --> 01:10:51.760
to hear your message?

01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:53.360
Yeah, sure, I do,
but they're gonna have to

01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:55.130
turn it to a country station
to hear it, though.

01:10:55.130 --> 01:10:56.790
[Laughter]

01:10:56.790 --> 01:11:00.060
Brennley, who do you
pick as your coach?

01:11:00.060 --> 01:11:01.500
Come on, Brennley!

01:11:01.500 --> 01:11:03.170
[Audience shouting]
Come on, Brennley!

01:11:03.170 --> 01:11:05.100
Brennley!

01:11:06.700 --> 01:11:08.010
Go with your roots!

01:11:08.010 --> 01:11:10.170
Girl power, girl power,
girl power!

01:11:10.170 --> 01:11:12.380
Come on!
I don't know!

01:11:12.380 --> 01:11:13.440
Alicia?

01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:15.280
I don't know, honey.
This is you.

01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:17.480
We got to stick together!

01:11:18.850 --> 01:11:20.380
Let's do this!

01:11:20.380 --> 01:11:23.190
Oh, I love you both
so much!

01:11:23.190 --> 01:11:24.390
I know. It's crazy.

01:11:24.390 --> 01:11:25.420
Uh...

01:11:25.420 --> 01:11:26.820
I-I pick Blake.

01:11:26.820 --> 01:11:28.130
Yes!

01:11:28.130 --> 01:11:29.690
Whoo.

01:11:29.690 --> 01:11:30.900
Whew, you
had me worried.

01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:32.330
[Laughs]

01:11:32.330 --> 01:11:33.700
Yeah, you should
have been worried.

01:11:33.700 --> 01:11:35.170
I'm so excited!

01:11:35.170 --> 01:11:36.270
Brennley!

01:11:36.270 --> 01:11:38.000
Blake:
I love the potential that I have

01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.370
with somebody like Brennley.

01:11:39.370 --> 01:11:41.510
And I think you're gonna
see Brennley come a long way.

01:11:41.510 --> 01:11:44.040
You're so much
taller in person.

01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:46.180
But Alicia had me sweating
it out there a little bit.

01:11:47.350 --> 01:11:50.180
Blake was terrified of me
in that moment.

01:11:50.180 --> 01:11:53.580
He felt the strength of a woman.

01:11:53.580 --> 01:11:54.750
Blake was fighting for you,

01:11:54.750 --> 01:11:56.050
and then Alicia
really come in there.

01:11:56.050 --> 01:11:57.520
I know.
And it looked like...

01:11:57.520 --> 01:11:59.620
you weren't sure.
I've grown up
with country music,

01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:01.130
and I just had
to go with my roots.

01:12:01.130 --> 01:12:02.160
I can't believe it.

01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:03.390
You're on "The Voice."
Congratulations.

01:12:03.390 --> 01:12:05.160
Oh, my God!

01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:06.400
[Cheers and applause]

01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:08.770
Let's celebrate.
I'm on "The Voice!"

01:12:08.770 --> 01:12:11.000
[Laughs]
How about this right here?

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.410
Oh, yeah. You like that?
You like that?

01:12:14.410 --> 01:12:15.470
Do you like that?

01:12:15.470 --> 01:12:17.580
Guys, somebody
call the paramedic.

01:12:17.580 --> 01:12:19.610
[Laughter]
Blake's having a stroke.

01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:22.450
Somebody...

01:12:22.450 --> 01:12:24.220
Whoo, child.

01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:29.240
 This is "The Voice" 

01:12:29.510 --> 01:12:31.510
Daly: Welcome back
to the blind auditions.

01:12:34.510 --> 01:12:37.820
Philadelphia is where
I got my roots in music.

01:12:37.820 --> 01:12:39.850
 Very superstitious 

01:12:39.850 --> 01:12:43.020
It's cheesesteaks.
It's culture. It's history.

01:12:43.020 --> 01:12:45.560
We're just having a good time
rockin' out on the weekends.

01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:46.890
[Chuckles]

01:12:46.890 --> 01:12:48.160
Come on out.

01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:51.060
My name is Shaun Chrisjohn.
I'm 31 years old.

01:12:51.060 --> 01:12:54.030
My grandmother was very
prominent in me growing up.

01:12:54.030 --> 01:12:56.600
My mom had me kind of young,
so we all lived with her.

01:12:56.600 --> 01:12:57.940
And she would play
a lot of records...

01:12:57.940 --> 01:13:00.170
Marvin Gaye,
Luther Vandross, Sam Cooke.

01:13:00.170 --> 01:13:01.540
Michael Jackson was everything.

01:13:01.540 --> 01:13:03.140
He liked the song "Bad."

01:13:03.140 --> 01:13:05.640
He would come home from school,
when he was in first grade,

01:13:05.640 --> 01:13:07.950
and look at that video
every day.

01:13:07.950 --> 01:13:10.780
He was just a happy little boy.
He'd just sing all the time.

01:13:10.780 --> 01:13:14.020
And I was really surprised
how good he sounded.

01:13:14.020 --> 01:13:16.120
Shaun: I went to the mall
when I was in high school.

01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:18.460
They were calling random people
to go up on the stage and sing.

01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:19.930
I started singing a song.

01:13:19.930 --> 01:13:21.590
Next thing you know,
like, floods of people

01:13:21.590 --> 01:13:23.860
were coming from the balconies
and the food courts.

01:13:23.860 --> 01:13:25.300
And I'm, like, "Whoa."

01:13:25.300 --> 01:13:27.830
From that point on, I was, like,
"Yeah, I-I want to be on stage."

01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:31.870
So, at the end of high school,
my original plan was to move out

01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:34.870
to either L.A., Atlanta,
or New York.

01:13:34.910 --> 01:13:36.540
I wanted to go out
and pursue my career,

01:13:36.540 --> 01:13:38.710
but when my grandmother's
health started to fade,

01:13:38.710 --> 01:13:40.610
you know, plans changed.

01:13:40.610 --> 01:13:43.250
So, I had to stay
and make sure that she was okay.

01:13:43.250 --> 01:13:45.120
A few years ago,
I became her official caretaker.

01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:48.790
Lorraine: I don't expect him to
be there the rest of his life,

01:13:48.790 --> 01:13:51.090
but just knowing
that he's there with me,

01:13:51.090 --> 01:13:53.260
you know,
keeps me safe and secure,

01:13:53.260 --> 01:13:55.160
just like I used to keep him
safe and secure.

01:13:57.300 --> 01:13:59.760
Shaun: I know what it feels like
to put aside your dream,

01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:02.000
to sacrifice for something
that's more important.

01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:03.570
But I just felt like
now is the time.

01:14:03.570 --> 01:14:05.570
I know my grandmother
still needs my help,

01:14:05.570 --> 01:14:07.640
and I'm gonna make sure
that she's cared for,

01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:10.380
but I know that she will want me
to still go out and flourish

01:14:10.410 --> 01:14:12.310
and fulfill my dreams.

01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:25.690
 Baby 

01:14:25.690 --> 01:14:29.190
 It's been a long day, baby 

01:14:30.930 --> 01:14:32.700
 Things ain't
been going my way 

01:14:32.700 --> 01:14:35.600
 You know I need you here 

01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:37.340
Wow.

01:14:37.340 --> 01:14:41.440
 To clear my mind 

01:14:41.940 --> 01:14:49.180
 Oh, because
you are the best thing 

01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:55.050
 You are the best thing 

01:14:55.050 --> 01:14:56.450
 Yeah 

01:14:56.450 --> 01:15:01.890
 You are the best thing 

01:15:01.890 --> 01:15:05.660
 That's ever happened to me 

01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:09.530
 You are 

01:15:09.530 --> 01:15:11.270
 Ooh-hoo 

01:15:11.270 --> 01:15:13.240
 The best thing, baby 

01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:18.710
 You are the best thing, yeah 

01:15:18.710 --> 01:15:22.980
 You are, you are
the best thing, yeah 

01:15:22.980 --> 01:15:24.550
 Yeah 

01:15:24.550 --> 01:15:30.690
 That's ever happened to me 

01:15:30.690 --> 01:15:33.860
[Cheers and applause]

01:15:38.460 --> 01:15:40.500
That was great.
What's your name?

01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:42.200
Shaun Chrisjohn.
I'm 31.

01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:43.470
I'm from Philadelphia.

01:15:43.470 --> 01:15:45.940
You really, really do have
a beautiful voice.

01:15:45.940 --> 01:15:48.740
I don't want you to feel
anything but really proud

01:15:48.740 --> 01:15:50.140
of yourself 'cause
you came out here,

01:15:50.140 --> 01:15:51.380
and you gave it
your all.

01:15:51.410 --> 01:15:54.480
You have a super, super,
beautiful, emotional voice,

01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:56.550
and thank you so much
for singing with us today.

01:15:56.550 --> 01:15:59.350
Thank you, Alicia.
[Laughs]

01:15:59.350 --> 01:16:01.350
- Hey, Shaun.
- How you doing, Blake?

01:16:01.350 --> 01:16:04.360
I mean, I was... I was right
there on the edge of my seat,

01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:06.160
just thinking I was
gonna push any second.

01:16:06.160 --> 01:16:07.990
There was one part
where you went into

01:16:07.990 --> 01:16:10.230
your falsetto and did some
pretty cool, tricky stuff.

01:16:10.230 --> 01:16:11.930
But some of the transitions
getting there

01:16:11.930 --> 01:16:14.570
kind of got a little bit
wonky, and not a big deal.

01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:17.570
But it was enough to keep me
from... from hitting my button.

01:16:17.570 --> 01:16:18.970
But thank you
so much for coming,

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:20.440
and we all appreciate you.

01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:21.670
Thank you, Blake.

01:16:21.710 --> 01:16:23.340
[Applause]

01:16:23.340 --> 01:16:25.710
Alicia:
Shaun was really good,

01:16:25.710 --> 01:16:29.050
but I'm still looking for
a real emotional connection.

01:16:29.050 --> 01:16:30.820
Super dope.
You're incredible, man.

01:16:30.820 --> 01:16:32.750
I'm waiting for something
that moves me.

01:16:32.750 --> 01:16:34.850
Shaun: Singing for
the biggest names in music

01:16:34.850 --> 01:16:36.490
was an amazing experience.

01:16:36.490 --> 01:16:38.290
My grandmother,
she would be proud.

01:16:38.290 --> 01:16:39.720
And I'm just
gonna keep pressing.

01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:41.830
I'm gonna continue
what I'm doing.

01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:43.190
Daly: Still to come...

01:16:43.190 --> 01:16:46.100
 All I could do was cry 

01:16:46.100 --> 01:16:48.570
I think I want to hear
Alicia Keys and Felicia Keys

01:16:48.570 --> 01:16:49.930
do a duet together.

01:16:49.930 --> 01:16:51.270
[Cheers and applause]

01:16:51.270 --> 01:16:56.340
 I never loved someone 

01:16:56.340 --> 01:17:00.140
 The way that I'm loving you 

01:17:02.250 --> 01:17:04.180
 This is "The Voice" 

01:17:07.970 --> 01:17:10.140
Daly: Welcome back.

01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:16.090
Right now, I'm on my way
to Teaneck, New Jersey,

01:17:16.090 --> 01:17:18.530
to see Felicia Temple,
who's been trying to balance

01:17:18.530 --> 01:17:20.190
pursuing her dream of music

01:17:20.190 --> 01:17:22.460
with a full-time career
as a registered nurse.

01:17:22.460 --> 01:17:23.630
Any pain right now?

01:17:23.630 --> 01:17:24.630
No, I'm good.

01:17:24.630 --> 01:17:25.970
Let's check out
your blood pressure.

01:17:25.970 --> 01:17:27.940
Felicia: I decided
to become a nurse because

01:17:27.940 --> 01:17:29.740
I always loved
the medical field.

01:17:29.740 --> 01:17:33.110
You'd see people during
their most vulnerable times,

01:17:33.110 --> 01:17:35.610
so you have to be aware
of people's needs

01:17:35.610 --> 01:17:37.010
and be empathetic to that.

01:17:37.010 --> 01:17:38.350
Can you
squeeze my hands?

01:17:38.350 --> 01:17:40.480
It's super important for me
to make them feel

01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:41.920
as comfortable as possible.

01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:43.820
Is that something you always
wanted to do, be a nurse?

01:17:43.820 --> 01:17:46.220
I grew up always wanting
to be a musician,

01:17:46.220 --> 01:17:49.560
and my dad lives
the same double life that I do.

01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:51.990
He's a police officer
and a musician,

01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:53.900
for about 25 years
with the Sugar Hill Gang.

01:17:53.900 --> 01:17:54.930
Oh, wow.
Yeah.

01:17:54.930 --> 01:17:56.500
How do you juggle
being a nurse

01:17:56.500 --> 01:17:58.830
and also this dream
you've had of... of doing music?

01:17:58.830 --> 01:18:00.170
I've been able
to manage it.

01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:03.040
I've done amazing shows
with BET,

01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:04.740
and then I was able
to sing The National Anthem

01:18:04.740 --> 01:18:07.640
at Madison Square Garden,
but everything came to a halt

01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:09.980
last year when I got
diagnosed with cancer.

01:18:11.410 --> 01:18:13.980
The kind of cancer that
I had is called carcinoid.

01:18:13.980 --> 01:18:17.290
It's very, very rare
and hard to treat.

01:18:17.290 --> 01:18:20.760
Any way that they could
look at my abdomen, they have,

01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:22.820
and then I had surgery.

01:18:22.820 --> 01:18:25.460
There was a possibility
that I wouldn't sing again.

01:18:25.460 --> 01:18:27.200
I had my stomach cut open,

01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:30.470
so I wasn't really able
to breathe very well.

01:18:30.470 --> 01:18:35.870
I did six rounds of oral chemo,
and I'm free and clear now.

01:18:35.900 --> 01:18:39.640
Last year, I did not know
what was gonna happen to me,

01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:43.850
so it's so beautiful
for things to turn around.

01:18:45.910 --> 01:18:49.080
Being here at "The Voice"
is a major opportunity.

01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:52.820
I'm just looking forward
to start a new chapter.

01:18:53.090 --> 01:18:57.290
Life is short,
and I want to live my dream.

01:19:04.500 --> 01:19:08.640
 Ooh, ohh 

01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:12.470
 I heard 

01:19:12.510 --> 01:19:17.110
 Church bells ringing 

01:19:17.110 --> 01:19:20.310
 I heard 

01:19:20.310 --> 01:19:26.020
 A choir singing 

01:19:26.020 --> 01:19:29.790
 I heard the promise 

01:19:29.790 --> 01:19:34.230
 Till death do us part 

01:19:34.230 --> 01:19:40.230
 Each word
was a pain in my heart 

01:19:40.230 --> 01:19:44.740
 And oh, oh, oh 

01:19:44.740 --> 01:19:50.650
 All I could do was cry 

01:19:50.650 --> 01:19:59.220
 And all I could do was cry 

01:19:59.220 --> 01:20:03.720
 I was losing the man
that I loved 

01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:04.990
There you go! She got it!
She got it!

01:20:04.990 --> 01:20:06.030
Yeah!

01:20:06.030 --> 01:20:14.340
 And all I could do was cry 

01:20:15.940 --> 01:20:19.640
 I was losing 

01:20:19.640 --> 01:20:23.740
 The man that I loved 

01:20:23.740 --> 01:20:28.880
 And all I could do 

01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:36.220
 Was cry-y-y-y-y-y-y-y 

01:20:36.220 --> 01:20:38.360
Oh, my God!
I knew it!

01:20:40.860 --> 01:20:43.970
[Cheers and applause]

01:20:46.170 --> 01:20:47.870
Yes!

01:20:47.900 --> 01:20:50.470
[Cheers and applause]

01:20:50.500 --> 01:20:51.810
Ahh!

01:20:53.110 --> 01:20:54.110
Adam?

01:20:54.110 --> 01:20:54.940
What?

01:20:54.940 --> 01:20:57.650
What is the matter with you?

01:20:57.650 --> 01:20:58.710
Well, that was awesome.

01:20:58.710 --> 01:21:00.820
What is the matter
with him?

01:21:00.820 --> 01:21:01.820
What's your name?

01:21:01.820 --> 01:21:03.550
My name
is Felicia Temple.

01:21:03.550 --> 01:21:05.520
I'm 28 years old, and I'm from
Teaneck, New Jersey.

01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:06.950
First of all,
I love your voice.

01:21:06.950 --> 01:21:09.020
So much that he didn't
hit his button.

01:21:09.020 --> 01:21:10.120
[Laughter]

01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:11.390
I heard a little Alicia
in the beginning.

01:21:11.390 --> 01:21:12.990
I did, too.
I heard a little bit.

01:21:12.990 --> 01:21:14.730
I was, like, "I'm not gonna
turn. What's the point?"

01:21:14.730 --> 01:21:16.030
Alicia.
No.

01:21:16.030 --> 01:21:17.200
Felicia.

01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:18.770
My name was Felicia Keys

01:21:18.770 --> 01:21:21.270
'cause I played all her
songs at the talent shows.

01:21:21.300 --> 01:21:23.070
Come on, it's my...

01:21:23.100 --> 01:21:24.640
[Cheers and applause]

01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:26.440
Bring it in!
Bring it in!

01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:27.810
Oh, my God!

01:21:31.650 --> 01:21:32.810
Should we just
turn back around?

01:21:32.810 --> 01:21:34.580
Yeah.

01:21:35.980 --> 01:21:37.050
[Laughs]

01:21:37.050 --> 01:21:39.590
What the heck?
What is...

01:21:39.590 --> 01:21:42.560
I-I'm not giving up.
I'm not giving up.

01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:46.060
[Cheers and applause]

01:21:48.060 --> 01:21:51.100
Nobody has ever said,
"I was Jake Shelton."

01:21:51.100 --> 01:21:53.270
[Laughter]

01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:56.240
First of all,
this is weird.

01:21:56.240 --> 01:21:57.270
- Yeah?
- But I love it.

01:21:57.310 --> 01:21:58.540
I just came
to hang out with Blake

01:21:58.540 --> 01:21:59.910
'cause I felt
sorry for us.

01:21:59.910 --> 01:22:01.740
I think... I think I
want to hear Alicia Keys
and Felicia Keys

01:22:01.740 --> 01:22:03.480
do a duet together.

01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:05.450
Yeah!

01:22:05.450 --> 01:22:07.750
[Cheers and applause]

01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:10.690
Yes! Yes!
Go!

01:22:10.690 --> 01:22:11.750
Go!
Yes!

01:22:13.020 --> 01:22:14.520
I feel sorry for us.

01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:15.690
This is surreal.
Wow.

01:22:15.690 --> 01:22:18.060
Like, I'm a... I'm a
perioperative nurse.

01:22:18.060 --> 01:22:20.230
[Laughter]

01:22:20.230 --> 01:22:21.560
You're an artist.

01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:23.730
You're a beautiful artist.
That's what you are.

01:22:23.730 --> 01:22:26.030
I think we should sing...

01:22:26.030 --> 01:22:30.540
 I keep on fallin' 

01:22:30.540 --> 01:22:33.070
 In and out 

01:22:33.110 --> 01:22:37.140
 Of love with you 

01:22:37.140 --> 01:22:42.250
 I never loved someone 

01:22:42.250 --> 01:22:47.560
 The way that I love you 

01:22:47.560 --> 01:22:53.730
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh 

01:22:55.600 --> 01:23:00.840
 I never loved someone 

01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:05.770
 The way that I love you 

01:23:05.810 --> 01:23:08.640
[Cheers and applause]

01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:10.040
Felicia, girl!

01:23:14.820 --> 01:23:16.450
Felicia, who... who do you
pick as your coach?

01:23:16.450 --> 01:23:17.820
[Laughter]

01:23:17.820 --> 01:23:19.150
They didn't even
get to say anything.

01:23:19.150 --> 01:23:20.520
They didn't even
get to talk.

01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:21.520
I think... I think we're all
adults here.

01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:22.620
- Yeah.
- You know what I'm saying?

01:23:22.620 --> 01:23:24.360
He's actually
right this time.

01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:25.590
Who do you pick
as your coach?

01:23:25.590 --> 01:23:26.960
Say it loud,
say it proud.

01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:28.930
I pick Alicia!

01:23:28.930 --> 01:23:30.470
 This girl is on fire 

01:23:30.470 --> 01:23:33.470
Yeah!

01:23:33.500 --> 01:23:35.040
 This girl is on fire 

01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:36.740
Alicia:
Felicia's pretty incredible.

01:23:36.740 --> 01:23:38.340
Such a variety to her voice,

01:23:38.340 --> 01:23:41.410
but a powerhouse vocalist,
also a tenderness.

01:23:41.410 --> 01:23:43.680
And I'm gonna take that
all the way.

01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:46.180
Let's go say hello
to your family.

01:23:46.180 --> 01:23:47.720
That was so good.

01:23:47.720 --> 01:23:49.080
I don't know what...

01:23:49.080 --> 01:23:50.920
- My mom was a little bit...
- What was that?

01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:53.390
That was the most amazing thing
I've ever seen on this show.

01:23:53.390 --> 01:23:54.590
What?

01:23:54.590 --> 01:23:55.860
Wow. How do you feel?

01:23:55.860 --> 01:23:57.560
I can't believe
this is happening.

01:23:57.560 --> 01:23:58.690
That was so fun.

01:23:58.690 --> 01:24:00.260
That was amazing.
Amazing, girl.

01:24:00.260 --> 01:24:02.030
I'm gonna have the best
margarita tonight.

01:24:02.030 --> 01:24:03.200
Yes!

01:24:03.200 --> 01:24:05.170
[Laughter]

01:24:05.170 --> 01:24:06.300
That was awesome.

01:24:09.340 --> 01:24:11.340
[Humming]

01:24:11.340 --> 01:24:13.010
[Laughter]

01:24:14.305 --> 01:24:20.318
