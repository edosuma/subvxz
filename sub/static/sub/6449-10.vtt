-The store was out.

37:08.559 --> 37:09.844
l destroyed the mirror box.

37:10.061 --> 37:13.303
You won't ever have to worry
about seeing him again.

37:13.856 --> 37:17.144
He wasn't you, Clark.
I mean, not "you" you.

37:17.318 --> 37:19.650
The circumstances
were different on that side...

37:19.820 --> 37:21.981
...but it was still me in that mirror.

37:22.156 --> 37:25.319
And the way you looked at me, Lois,
with so much hate....

37:27.328 --> 37:31.492
It's like you had formed your opinion
about Clark Luthor. For good reason.

37:31.666 --> 37:33.782
He was a monster.

37:34.502 --> 37:35.537
l was a monster.

37:35.711 --> 37:37.702
Makes you wonder
how Earth-2 Lois Lane...

37:37.880 --> 37:40.166
...managed to put up
with such a colossal tool.

37:40.341 --> 37:42.673
Consider yourself
universally consistent.

37:43.302 --> 37:44.838
You didn't cut him any slack.

37:48.099 --> 37:50.886
But I do think she was about to give him
another chance.

37:51.102 --> 37:54.515
You don't have to worry about
second chances with me.

37:54.689 --> 37:57.726
You're doing really well
with the first one.

38:24.218 --> 38:26.755
CLARK:
Luthor blood is poison.

38:28.055 --> 38:30.717
That's what I said
before things got weird.

38:31.726 --> 38:34.763
Who knew you had such a gift
for understatement?

38:35.855 --> 38:38.221
The heir that Lionel left the box to,
it's you.

38:44.739 --> 38:46.604
Given all that the Luthors have done...

38:46.782 --> 38:50.570
...is it any surprise I didn't feel like
sharing with the rest Of the class?

38:51.245 --> 38:52.701
I'm guessing how I reacted...

38:52.872 --> 38:54.863
...is why you didn't tell me everything.

38:56.459 --> 38:59.451
Clark, you wanna know
the truly perverse part?

39:04.258 --> 39:07.045
I'm upset that he threw me away.

39:08.596 --> 39:13.590
As grotesque and sordid a family tree
as I've just inherited...

39:17.396 --> 39:19.102
...I wasn't good enough.

39:22.276 --> 39:23.982
You're lucky.

39:24.195 --> 39:25.776
The Kents found you.

39:29.450 --> 39:31.941
But you weren't so unlucky.

39:33.788 --> 39:36.120
As screwed up as you think
your life has been...

39:36.290 --> 39:38.622
...Lionel didn't raise you on this side.

39:46.634 --> 39:48.841
And what happened with...

39:50.805 --> 39:52.466
...the other Clark is just proof...

39:52.640 --> 39:55.256
...that Lionel's blood doesn't corrupt...

40:00.940 --> 40:02.931
l was wrong.

40:08.155 --> 40:11.488
The real reason that I hid Alexander...

40:15.246 --> 40:20.661
...is because I didn't want anyone
to take him away from me.

40:27.550 --> 40:31.964
l was afraid that he might be the closest
thing to family that I would ever know.

40:34.473 --> 40:36.555
But he fooled me.

40:40.020 --> 40:42.727
And he's just as smart as Lex...

40:42.898 --> 40:44.809
...if not smarter.

40:44.984 --> 40:48.852
When and if he's found,
it'll be because he wants to be.

40:53.200 --> 40:56.533
When Lex does show up,
we'll face him together.

41:01.208 --> 41:03.665
You're not alone anymore.

41:13.888 --> 41:17.051
-Don't I know you from somewhere?
-I don't think so.

41:17.224 --> 41:18.555
I'm from out of town.

41:18.726 --> 41:20.887
Unexpected visit.

41:22.855 --> 41:25.722
But I guess I'm back
in the nick Of time.

41:29.069 --> 41:32.061
Wouldn't wanna miss
how it all turns out.
