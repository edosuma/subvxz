he's been shot!

03:00.865 --> 03:03.683
Let's just get this over with.

03:03.685 --> 03:06.669
You said the identity

03:06.671 --> 03:09.422
of the shooter was unknown
to you at that time.

03:09.424 --> 03:11.057
Is that still correct?
Yes, sir.

03:11.059 --> 03:13.442
So it wasn't
until recently

03:13.444 --> 03:14.977
that you confirmed the identity
of your father's killer.

03:14.979 --> 03:15.928
That's right.

03:15.930 --> 03:17.346
I already told you all this.

03:17.348 --> 03:18.564

You're being investigated

03:21.102 --> 03:22.935
As a matter of fact,

03:22.937 --> 03:25.605
you've been investigated
by Internal Affairs before,

03:25.607 --> 03:27.406
haven't you, Lieutenant?

03:27.408 --> 03:28.574
Yes.

03:28.576 --> 03:29.942
Then you know that we've been

03:29.944 --> 03:32.328
granted oversight and are
invoking the Garrity Rule,

03:32.330 --> 03:34.330
which requires you
to answer all of our questions,

03:34.332 --> 03:36.449
whether you think
this is a waste of time or not.

03:36.451 --> 03:37.667

Very.

03:42.005 --> 03:44.373
MAN:
Lieutenant,

03:44.375 --> 03:46.259
can we talk about
how the identity

03:46.261 --> 03:47.376
of your father's murderer

03:47.378 --> 03:50.129
became known to you?

03:50.131 --> 03:52.131
Yeah.

03:52.133 --> 03:54.016
Uh, we caught a case
five days ago.

03:54.018 --> 03:57.253
There was a DB in a warehouse
on Sand Island.

04:03.310 --> 04:05.978
CHIN: You ever seen
anything like this?

04:05.980 --> 04:08.397
STEVE:
Never.

04:08.399 --> 04:10.850
(siren wailing in distance)

04:10.852 --> 04:13.085
Max, what'd they use
to torture this guy?

04:13.087 --> 04:16.706
Uh, well, given the
pinhead-sized singe marks,

04:16.708 --> 04:19.507
I'd say the implement that was
used was an acetylene torch.

04:19.510 --> 04:22.111
So the cause
of death is what?

04:22.113 --> 04:25.164
Shock. Most likely
from being repeatedly burned

04:25.166 --> 04:26.999
at 6,000 degrees Fahrenheit.

04:27.001 --> 04:28.951
So he was cooked
to death.

04:28.953 --> 04:31.637
Based on the physical
morphology of the injuries,

04:31.639 --> 04:34.974
I'd estimate several hours
of systematic torture.

04:34.976 --> 04:37.276
Something like this--

04:37.278 --> 04:38.628
might be cartel-related.

04:38.630 --> 04:40.913
Drugs, money,
murder for hire.

04:40.915 --> 04:43.432
If that's the case,
whoever ordered this

04:43.434 --> 04:45.735

05:56.116 --> 05:57.401
Hey.

05:57.501 --> 05:59.568
I spoke to Steve today.

05:59.570 --> 06:02.087
He's thinking
about becoming a Navy SEAL.

06:03.190 --> 06:04.406
(laughs)

06:04.408 --> 06:05.624
I mean, it's kind of a relief.

06:05.626 --> 06:07.409
I thought sure
he'd want to be a cop.

06:11.097 --> 06:13.098
How's your mom doing?

06:14.885 --> 06:16.752
About as good
as can be expected.

06:16.754 --> 06:18.587
Why don't you
take a few days?

06:18.589 --> 06:19.972
You know?
Be there for her...

06:19.974 --> 06:22.591
Yeah, thanks,
but I already offered.

06:22.593 --> 06:25.060
Moms can be
stubborn like that.

06:25.062 --> 06:26.645
Yeah.

06:26.647 --> 06:29.648
If she needs anything,
don't be shy.

06:29.650 --> 06:30.766
Malia.

06:30.768 --> 06:31.784
MALIA:
Hi.

06:31.786 --> 06:32.935
Um, sorry to barge in on you...

06:32.937 --> 06:33.953
JOHN:
No, sit down.

06:33.955 --> 06:35.187
Have some coffee.

06:35.189 --> 06:36.155
I wish I could.

06:36.157 --> 06:38.424
Chin, could I see you
for a moment?

06:38.426 --> 06:39.425
Yeah, sure.

06:39.427 --> 06:41.160
Oh...

06:41.162 --> 06:44.163
Ah, ah. Hey.
Forget about it.

06:44.165 --> 06:45.881
Thanks.

06:50.053 --> 06:52.888
MALIA:
<i>I hate coming to you with this,</i>

06:52.890 --> 06:55.123
especially now,

06:55.125 --> 06:56.959

my brother.

06:56.961 --> 06:58.310
He's a good kid.

06:58.312 --> 06:59.345
What did he do?

06:59.347 --> 07:01.630
They say he stole a car.

07:01.632 --> 07:03.849
(sighs)

07:03.851 --> 07:07.403
HPD brought him in
about an hour ago,

07:07.405 --> 07:08.854
but they haven't
processed him yet.

07:08.856 --> 07:10.606
I just spoke to him,

07:10.608 --> 07:12.358
and he   sounds
really scared.

07:12.360 --> 07:14.610
Yeah, I'll bet he is.

07:14.612 --> 07:16.078
If they book Gabriel,

07:16.080 --> 07:19.999
that record's going to follow
him the rest of his life.

07:24.788 --> 07:26.488
All right. All right.

07:26.490 --> 07:29.375
I'll, uh...
I'll see what I can do.

07:29.377 --> 07:31.794
MAN:
So what did you do?

07:31.796 --> 07:33.529
How about I tell you
what you did?

07:33.531 --> 07:36.048
You persuaded the complainant
not to press charges,

07:36.050 --> 07:37.600
got a withdrawal
complaint signed,

07:37.602 --> 07:38.550
killing the case

07:38.552 --> 07:40.135
Gabriel was a kid.

07:40.137 --> 07:41.103
(chuckles)

07:41.105 --> 07:42.438
Weren't you
a kid once?

07:42.440 --> 07:44.523
Lieutenant Kelly, Gabriel
Waincroft was 18 years old.

07:44.525 --> 07:46.442
That's no kid. He stole a car.

07:46.444 --> 07:48.010
We call that grand larceny,
and you,

07:48.012 --> 07:49.862
as a sworn officer
of the law, ignored that.

07:49.864 --> 07:52.698
You got a history
of covering for family members

07:52.700 --> 07:53.816
who break the law,
don't you, Lieutenant?

07:53.818 --> 07:55.150
What's that
supposed to mean?

07:55.152 --> 07:57.152
Your uncle stole drug money
from a police evidence locker,

07:57.154 --> 07:58.570
and you kept that
quiet for years.

07:58.572 --> 08:00.322
I don't see how that's relevant.
Seems to be

08:00.324 --> 08:02.041
part of a pattern; I think
that's more than relevant.

08:02.043 --> 08:04.243
That's exactly the reason
why we're here to

08:04.245 --> 08:06.028
to find out what you knew
and when you knew it,

08:06.030 --> 08:08.047
and if there was a cover-up.

08:09.299 --> 08:11.684
Gabriel had never been
in trouble before.

08:11.686 --> 08:13.201
Not for anything.

08:13.203 --> 08:15.054
I figured if I could
just set him straight,

08:15.056 --> 08:16.889
he wouldn't do anything
like this again.

08:16.891 --> 08:17.890
(scoffs)

08:17.892 --> 08:20.876
Well, I guess you figured wrong.

08:23.229 --> 08:25.431
What the hell were you thinking?

08:25.433 --> 08:26.765
I don't know.

08:26.767 --> 08:28.684
That's not an answer.

08:28.686 --> 08:29.601
I'm sorry.

08:29.603 --> 08:30.936
We were just goofing around.

08:30.938 --> 08:31.987
Goofing around.

08:31.989 --> 08:33.889
You know you could be
in jail right now?

08:36.626 --> 08:39.745
What, you got someplace
you got to be?

08:39.746 --> 08:41.080
I'm cool.

08:41.082 --> 08:42.448
Just 'cause I'm in
the picture doesn't mean

08:42.450 --> 08:44.249
you have a "get out of
jail free" card, okay?

08:44.251 --> 08:45.451
This is a one-time thing.

08:45.453 --> 08:47.836
The next time, you are
on your own. You hear me?

08:47.838 --> 08:49.171
I didn't ask
for your help.

08:49.173 --> 08:50.756
No, but your sister did.

08:50.758 --> 08:52.758
And after everything
she's done for you,

08:52.760 --> 08:55.344
you owe it to her
to keep your nose clean.

08:55.346 --> 08:57.513
You broke her heart, Gabriel.

09:02.135 --> 09:05.270
I'm sorry.

09:05.272 --> 09:08.090
Those are words,
brother, just words.

09:08.092 --> 09:09.475
You really want
to make it right?

09:09.477 --> 09:10.476
You get a job.

09:10.478 --> 09:11.643
You show your family

09:11.645 --> 09:13.428
you got something to offer
besides heartache.

09:15.115 --> 09:17.866
I hear Rainbow is hiring.

09:17.868 --> 09:20.619
What, pushing loco moco
to <i>haole</i> tourists?

09:20.621 --> 09:21.687
No way.

09:21.689 --> 09:24.106
What, you got bigger plans,
is that it?

09:25.775 --> 09:28.276
Maybe.

09:31.998 --> 09:34.917
You messed up,
Lieutenant.

09:34.919 --> 09:36.135
Yeah, I heard you.

09:36.137 --> 09:37.403
By letting
that kid go,

09:37.405 --> 09:39.588
you sent a message
that he was bulletproof.

09:39.590 --> 09:40.789
And that created
a monster--

09:40.791 --> 09:42.457
a monster that's left
a trail of blood

09:42.459 --> 09:43.675
from here to Sinaloa.

09:45.261 --> 09:47.629
What I don't get is how
you could let that happen.

09:47.631 --> 09:48.847
You were a cop,

09:48.849 --> 09:53.268
and yet you let that kid
manipulate you from day one.

09:53.270 --> 09:54.853
How come
you couldn't see that?

09:54.855 --> 09:57.356
Maybe you couldn't
see it coming

09:57.358 --> 10:00.943
'cause you were rolling around
in bed with his sister.

10:00.945 --> 10:03.779
Say something else
about my wife.

10:03.781 --> 10:06.982
Take a swing
or sit your ass back down.

10:11.821 --> 10:14.006
Go to hell.

10:20.997 --> 10:22.598
Hey. Chin, this is
what they do.

10:22.600 --> 10:24.783
Try to get
under your skin.

10:24.785 --> 10:26.552
Well, it's working.
STEVE: Hey.

10:26.554 --> 10:28.020
You got to take
the personal out of it.

10:28.022 --> 10:29.671
How the hell am I
supposed to do that?

10:29.673 --> 10:30.889
There's no way not
to make that personal!

10:30.891 --> 10:32.674
Chin, stop.

10:33.977 --> 10:35.477
This is the game.

10:35.479 --> 10:37.646
They put you
to the test,

10:37.648 --> 10:38.847
and you're gonna
pass that test,

10:38.849 --> 10:40.232
but you got to answer
their questions,

10:40.234 --> 10:41.617
and you got to
answer them straight,

10:41.619 --> 10:43.202
take all the emotion
out, okay?

10:45.155 --> 10:46.855
What if I was wrong?

10:46.857 --> 10:48.407
What are you talking about?

10:49.909 --> 10:51.543
I was in love with Malia.

10:51.545 --> 10:53.128
Maybe my judgment
was clouded.

10:53.130 --> 10:54.246
Maybe I just
didn't want

10:54.248 --> 10:57.049
to believe that her brother
was capable of murder!

10:58.551 --> 11:01.253
BRANCH: <i>I understand</i>
<i>you have a DB down there</i>

11:01.255 --> 11:02.754
by the name of Amos Koi.

11:02.756 --> 11:04.506
Yeah, that's right.
He was burned to death.

11:04.508 --> 11:05.874
What's DEA's interest in it?

11:05.876 --> 11:08.227
We believe he's been working
as a pilot for hire

11:08.229 --> 11:10.479
for some Pacific Rim
drug smugglers.

11:10.481 --> 11:11.663
KONO:
Any gang in particular?

11:11.665 --> 11:14.149
The Culiacan Cartel
out of Sinaloa, Mexico.

11:14.151 --> 11:17.186
Okay, so maybe Koi
wronged his bosses.

11:17.188 --> 11:19.738
Uh, he ripped them off
and then paid the price.

11:19.740 --> 11:21.056
That's certainly
a viable theory,

11:21.058 --> 11:23.442
considering the cartel boss
arrived on your island

11:23.444 --> 11:24.693
three days ago.

11:24.695 --> 11:25.911
Who is he?

11:25.913 --> 11:28.330
I'm putting up a photo now.

11:30.233 --> 11:33.502
Agent Branch, are you sure
this man is the boss?

11:33.504 --> 11:36.288
Yeah, he's definitely our man.

11:36.290 --> 11:37.956
STEVE:
Chin, what's the matter?

11:37.958 --> 11:39.508
You know this guy?

11:39.510 --> 11:42.761
Yeah, his name
is Gabriel Waincroft.

11:42.763 --> 11:44.913
He's Malia's brother.

11:56.643 --> 11:58.861
What's this about?

11:58.863 --> 12:01.697
You insult my wife again,
you might as well keep it

12:01.699 --> 12:03.699
for what I'm gonna do to you.

12:03.701 --> 12:06.485
(chuckles)

12:06.487 --> 12:08.654
I'll take that
under advisement.

12:13.493 --> 12:15.277
Now, where were we?

12:35.509 --> 12:39.078

12:39.080 --> 12:43.016

12:43.018 --> 12:46.919

Time to be born.

12:48.523 --> 12:50.256
Time to die.

12:50.258 --> 12:52.108
Time to laugh.

12:52.110 --> 12:53.976
Time to weep.

12:53.978 --> 12:56.429
This is one such time.

13:01.268 --> 13:05.121
Kam Tong Kelly was
the best man I ever knew.

13:08.659 --> 13:10.109
His love of life

13:10.111 --> 13:13.496
was exceeded only
by his love of family,

13:13.498 --> 13:16.866
which everyone here today
was a member.

13:16.868 --> 13:20.286
A life full of commendations
and awards

13:20.288 --> 13:22.388
meant nothing to him
compared to the pride

13:22.390 --> 13:25.758
that he felt when his eldest son,

13:25.760 --> 13:29.512
Chin Ho, enrolled in
the police academy.

13:29.514 --> 13:31.931
It is through him

13:31.933 --> 13:35.068
that Kam Tong's
legacy continues.

13:35.070 --> 13:38.554
A legacy that embraces all of us

15:54.292 --> 15:56.125
The crime lab just got
a case-to-case hit

15:56.127 --> 15:58.044
on the gun used
to kill your dad.

15:58.046 --> 16:00.463
Suspect's name is Ronald Palau.

16:00.465 --> 16:02.114
He was questioned
last year in a homicide.

Whoa, Chin.

I'm under orders

16:09.474 --> 16:10.890
No way I'm standing down.

Hands, you son of a bitch.

MAN: <i>Sergeant McGarrett</i>

16:26.624 --> 16:28.991
Is that correct?
Yes.

16:28.993 --> 16:31.661
And he was relaying a direct
order from HPD command.

16:31.663 --> 16:33.829
You were told not
to participate in any aspect

16:33.831 --> 16:35.981

murder investigation.

16:35.983 --> 16:37.366
That's right.

16:37.368 --> 16:39.285
But I don't know any cop

16:39.287 --> 16:41.153
who wouldn't have done
the same thing.

16:41.155 --> 16:43.139
This was my father
we're talking about.

16:43.141 --> 16:46.175
Mm-hmm.

did you?

16:53.184 --> 16:54.200
No.

16:54.202 --> 16:55.518
Ronald Palau owned the gun,

16:55.520 --> 16:58.170
but it turns out his son sold it
without telling him.

16:58.172 --> 17:00.957
Name?

17:07.397 --> 17:08.781
No, Harold was
a meth tweeker.

17:08.782 --> 17:11.016
He wasn't gonna give us a name.

17:11.018 --> 17:12.318
Also, it was a cash transaction.

17:12.319 --> 17:13.852
There was nothing to trace.

17:13.854 --> 17:15.186
We hit a dead end.

But that wasn't the end of it,
was it, Lieutenant?

17:17.909 --> 17:20.626
No, a couple weeks later,
we caught a break.

17:20.627 --> 17:23.829
Found the murder weapon in
a storm drain in Waikiki.

17:23.830 --> 17:25.080
Managed to pull
one viable print,

Well, that's
what we thought.

18:42.910 --> 18:44.293
But when we took
the picture down

18:44.295 --> 18:46.712
to the convenience store owner,
he said that Luna was not

18:46.714 --> 18:48.130
the man who murdered my father.

18:51.635 --> 18:54.136
I understand the store owner
was in the hospital

18:54.138 --> 18:55.971
when you went for the I.D.

18:55.973 --> 18:56.972
Is that correct?

18:56.974 --> 18:58.274
Yeah, he, uh...

18:58.276 --> 19:00.226
suffered a stroke
after the robbery.

19:00.228 --> 19:03.095
He had some aphasia
and memory loss,

19:03.097 --> 19:05.748
but he was pretty adamant
that Luna wasn't the guy.

19:05.750 --> 19:07.099
Yet, you had Teddy Luna's prints
on the weapon.

19:07.101 --> 19:08.517
Luna admitted
to handling the weapon,

19:08.519 --> 19:10.152
but denied knowing anything
about the murder.

19:10.154 --> 19:11.654
Did you believe him?

19:11.656 --> 19:13.138
Doesn't matter what I believed.

19:13.140 --> 19:15.307
We charged him with criminal
possession of a weapon.

19:15.309 --> 19:19.261
He made bail, took a plea
and walked with no jail time.

19:19.263 --> 19:20.496
You just let him go?

19:20.498 --> 19:21.947
We had no choice!

19:21.949 --> 19:23.833
(laughs)
But without Teddy Luna,

19:23.835 --> 19:26.285
you-you never would've I.D.'d

19:26.287 --> 19:28.120
Yeah.

19:28.122 --> 19:30.406
Luna did inadvertently
provide us with a clue,

19:30.408 --> 19:32.658
but we were never able
to get anywhere with it.

19:32.660 --> 19:34.126
Can you elaborate on that?

19:34.128 --> 19:35.911

was released,

19:37.632 --> 19:39.215

19:39.217 --> 19:41.434

19:43.854 --> 19:45.721
I recognize this one.

19:45.723 --> 19:47.506
That's Luna's cousin
on his father's side.

19:47.508 --> 19:49.308
He snitched for
me in the past.

19:49.310 --> 19:50.509
Where can we find him?

19:50.511 --> 19:52.194
He used to work the door

Yeah, his tat.

20:30.434 --> 20:33.686
Um, Malia's brother just

20:33.688 --> 20:35.187
Gabriel?

20:35.189 --> 20:36.789
Yeah.
Are you sure?

20:36.791 --> 20:40.442
Yeah, we were surfing Rock
Piles yesterday, I saw it.

20:40.444 --> 20:42.695
That's a gang tattoo.

20:42.697 --> 20:45.197
Could be Gabriel was
recently initiated.

20:45.199 --> 20:48.417
Question is:
what did he do to earn it?

20:54.424 --> 20:56.442
Chin, hey. What's up?

20:56.444 --> 20:57.409

20:57.411 --> 20:58.544
What the hell, dude?!

20:58.546 --> 21:00.379
Take off your rash guard!
What?

21:00.381 --> 21:02.581
You heard me.

21:14.744 --> 21:16.428
How did you get that?

21:16.430 --> 21:17.563
What do you mean?

21:17.565 --> 21:18.697
You know what I mean!

21:18.699 --> 21:20.032
What did you do
to earn it?!

21:20.034 --> 21:21.150
Nothing, man. It's just ink.

21:21.152 --> 21:22.284
Don't you lie to me!

21:22.286 --> 21:23.268
You don't get to wear that

21:23.270 --> 21:24.753
unless you prove yourself.

21:24.755 --> 21:26.989
So I'm gonna ask you
one last time.

21:26.991 --> 21:29.942
What did you do to
earn that tattoo?

21:32.629 --> 21:35.097
MAN:
<i>What was his answer?</i>

21:38.952 --> 21:41.387
He denied any gang involvement.

21:41.389 --> 21:45.090
Said he got the tattoo
to impress a girl.

21:45.092 --> 21:47.476
Did you believe him?

21:52.182 --> 21:54.333
(quietly):
No.

21:54.335 --> 21:58.020
You were aware at that time the
description the store owner gave

21:58.022 --> 21:59.738
to police didn't match
your suspect Luna.

21:59.740 --> 22:02.191
It did, however, resemble
your brother-in-law.

22:02.193 --> 22:04.309
The description given
to HPD was rough.

22:04.311 --> 22:05.578
Rough or not,

22:05.580 --> 22:07.813
the I.D. gave you reason
to come down hard on Gabriel.

22:07.815 --> 22:08.864
Isn't that right?

22:08.866 --> 22:10.599
Yeah. There was no way
to be sure.

22:10.601 --> 22:12.201
So, how did you follow up?

22:12.203 --> 22:13.252
I took Gabriel's picture

22:13.254 --> 22:15.671
to the store owner
in the hospital.

22:15.673 --> 22:17.339
Unfortunately, he passed away

22:17.341 --> 22:18.457
the night before.

22:18.459 --> 22:20.292
Oh. So you were never able
to ask him

22:20.294 --> 22:22.828
if your brother-in-law was the
man who murdered your father?

22:22.830 --> 22:24.513
That's right.

22:24.515 --> 22:26.331
And you had nothing

22:26.333 --> 22:29.518
that would tie Gabriel Waincroft
to the gun?

22:29.520 --> 22:31.186
Nothing.

22:32.272 --> 22:34.974
So, in other words,
that was the end of your case?

22:34.976 --> 22:36.392
Over the years,
we followed up

22:36.394 --> 22:38.227
on a lead or two,
but nothing ever came of it.

22:38.229 --> 22:39.495
But you always
suspected

22:39.497 --> 22:42.180
that Gabriel Waincroft
was guilty, didn't you?

22:42.182 --> 22:45.784
He had an alibi,
and it checked out.

22:45.786 --> 22:47.569
And there was
never any evidence

22:47.571 --> 22:49.571
linking him
directly to the crime.

22:49.573 --> 22:51.457
Deep down inside,
you had to believe

22:51.459 --> 22:54.627
he was involved, didn't you?

22:56.195 --> 22:59.164
Okay, let's take
your wife out of the equation

22:59.166 --> 23:00.382
for a moment, okay?

23:00.384 --> 23:02.367
I want you to think very
carefully before you answer.

23:02.369 --> 23:03.752
Did you or did you not suspect

23:03.754 --> 23:05.220
that Gabriel Waincroft
was the man

23:05.222 --> 23:07.006
who killed your father,
Kam Tong Kelly?

23:07.008 --> 23:09.058
As I said, he was
thoroughly investigated.

23:09.060 --> 23:10.959
That's not the question.
You're being too cute by half.

23:10.961 --> 23:13.595
I did my job!
Quit that damn gymnastics!

23:14.397 --> 23:16.715
Answer me!

23:17.851 --> 23:21.570
You thought Gabriel Waincroft
killed your father?

23:26.225 --> 23:28.610
Yes.

23:35.608 --> 23:37.008
If Gabriel murdered
Chin's father,

23:37.077 --> 23:38.526
why would Chin cover that up?

23:38.528 --> 23:39.661
Chin was in love.

23:39.663 --> 23:41.496
Love is like
temporary insanity.

23:41.498 --> 23:43.131
We do things
we'd normally never do,

23:43.133 --> 23:45.467
like, uh, disregard
our sworn duty,

23:45.469 --> 23:49.537
or align ourselves with people
who used to be our enemies.

23:49.539 --> 23:52.707
You can understand that,
can't you, Officer Kalakaua?

23:55.812 --> 23:57.479
Any comment?

23:57.481 --> 24:00.916
Turn off the video camera,
I'll give you a quote.

24:05.521 --> 24:08.156
Uh, continuing on.

24:08.158 --> 24:10.108
You said earlier Chin Ho

24:10.110 --> 24:11.810
never told you he suspected

24:11.812 --> 24:14.496
his brother-in-law
in killing his father?

24:14.498 --> 24:15.614
That's right.

24:15.616 --> 24:17.232
You two are cousins,
that true?

24:17.234 --> 24:18.667
We are.

24:18.669 --> 24:20.735
So you expect us
to believe

24:20.737 --> 24:22.954
that he carried around
that suspicion all this time

24:22.956 --> 24:24.923
and never mentioned it to you?

24:24.925 --> 24:26.875
I don't really care
what you believe.

24:26.877 --> 24:27.993
It's the truth.

24:27.995 --> 24:29.211
(laughs)

24:29.213 --> 24:31.763
Officer Kalakaua,
you are on the record.

24:31.765 --> 24:32.931
Please remember that.

24:32.933 --> 24:35.300
Well, then let the record show
that this is bull,

24:35.302 --> 24:36.968
because you have Chin Ho
in the crosshairs,

24:36.970 --> 24:39.420
and you're gonna twist whatever
I say to suit your agenda,

24:39.422 --> 24:41.473
so I don't even know why
I'm wasting my time.

24:41.475 --> 24:43.341
Officer Kalakaua,
let me remind you

24:43.343 --> 24:46.528
that your immunity and means
doesn't effect this proceeding.

24:46.530 --> 24:48.263
Even the governor
can't help you now.

24:48.265 --> 24:49.397
So I would suggest

24:49.399 --> 24:51.600
you stow your attitude
and sit back down.

24:51.602 --> 24:53.468
We're not even close
to being done.

24:56.205 --> 24:57.873
Please.

25:10.119 --> 25:12.620
No, Chin Ho Kelly, uh,
never went into detail

25:12.622 --> 25:14.172
about his father's murder.

25:14.174 --> 25:16.141
But that's...
that's the type of man he is.

25:16.143 --> 25:18.560
He doesn't want to burden
anybody with his troubles.

25:18.562 --> 25:20.395
But this was his father
we're talking about.

25:20.397 --> 25:21.680
Of all people, Commander,

25:21.682 --> 25:23.098
you could understand
wanting closure.

25:23.100 --> 25:25.684
What did you say?

25:25.686 --> 25:28.186
You heard what I said.

25:28.188 --> 25:30.939
Nice try.
You're way out of line.

25:30.941 --> 25:32.140
I'm out of line?

25:32.142 --> 25:34.192
One of your men let a killer
run free for 15 years.

25:34.194 --> 25:36.795
Suspecting and proving murder
are two very different things.

25:36.797 --> 25:38.980
Now, if you two
have got any evidence

25:38.982 --> 25:40.248
that you can back up
these claims

25:40.250 --> 25:41.583
you have against Chin Ho Kelly

25:41.585 --> 25:43.585
about him subverting the law,
I'd like to see it.

25:43.587 --> 25:46.487
That's the point of
this investigation, Commander.

25:46.489 --> 25:48.507
If there was evidence,
we believe

25:48.509 --> 25:50.926
Chin Ho made it disappear
to protect his family.

25:50.928 --> 25:52.127
Gabriel was nowhere near
as important

25:52.129 --> 25:53.461
to Chin Ho as his own father.

25:53.463 --> 25:54.880
That might have been true.

25:54.882 --> 25:56.164
But the old man was dead,

25:56.166 --> 25:58.216
and there was nothing
Chin Ho could do about that,

25:58.218 --> 26:00.468
except circle the wagons
and protect his family.

26:00.470 --> 26:01.937
And from everything
we know about your unit,

26:01.939 --> 26:04.105
family comes first.

26:04.107 --> 26:05.524
You implying
that I'm hiding something now?

26:05.526 --> 26:07.392
Is that what you're saying,
that this is a big cover-up?

26:07.394 --> 26:08.343
Look, we're all cops here.

26:08.345 --> 26:09.528
We know how this works.

26:09.530 --> 26:11.112
You have each other's backs,
right?

26:11.114 --> 26:15.784
But something like this--
you turn your back on a murder

26:15.786 --> 26:17.569
and letting that suspect grow

26:17.571 --> 26:20.539
into an even more
dangerous sociopath--

26:20.541 --> 26:23.742
that violates
the code of silence.

26:23.744 --> 26:25.410
You got that?

26:25.412 --> 26:27.495
If I knew
for one second

26:27.497 --> 26:30.882
that Chin Ho did
what you two are saying he did,

26:30.884 --> 26:34.102
I would have been the first one
to book him.

26:34.104 --> 26:36.805
You know what I'm going
to say, don't you?

26:36.807 --> 26:39.374
Yeah, that you want to pull me
off, that I'm too close.

26:39.376 --> 26:40.809
That's S.O.P., Chin.

26:40.811 --> 26:42.978
Since when do you
follow procedure?

26:44.780 --> 26:46.514
I trust you, Chin.

26:46.516 --> 26:48.149
You know that.

26:49.769 --> 26:51.319
But I got to ask you this.

26:51.321 --> 26:53.321
Did you ever have any idea

26:53.323 --> 26:55.824
what Gabriel was up to
this whole time?

26:58.778 --> 27:02.747
Steve, if you trust me,
you already know the answer.

27:05.001 --> 27:06.868
MAN: So, what you're saying is,
you had no idea

27:06.870 --> 27:08.837
that you gave a free ride
to the kid

27:08.839 --> 27:10.839
who would become a ruthless
cartel drug lord?

27:10.841 --> 27:13.908
Look, all I knew was

27:13.910 --> 27:16.077
that two years
after my father died,

27:16.079 --> 27:18.013
Gabriel told Malia
that he was leaving

27:18.015 --> 27:20.415
to take a construction job
on the mainland.

27:20.417 --> 27:22.183
Either you or your wife
have any contact

27:22.185 --> 27:23.335
with Gabriel after that?

27:23.337 --> 27:27.121
Malia stayed in contact with him
for a few years,

27:27.123 --> 27:30.625
but over time, it was just
too hard to get ahold of him.

27:30.627 --> 27:31.760
So you're telling us

27:31.762 --> 27:33.928
you neither saw nor heard
from him after he left

27:33.930 --> 27:35.430
for this so-called job
off the island?

27:35.432 --> 27:38.766
Yes, that's what
I'm telling you.

27:44.874 --> 27:46.875
Take a look at that.

27:46.877 --> 27:48.843
Tell me what it is.

27:48.845 --> 27:51.880
Looks like phone records.

27:51.882 --> 27:53.114
Be more specific.

27:55.051 --> 27:57.535
Calls from my home line.

27:57.537 --> 27:58.753
That's right.

27:58.755 --> 28:00.221
And as you can see,

28:00.223 --> 28:03.174
there were more than 20 calls
to a party in the 667 area code.

28:03.176 --> 28:04.676
Where is that,

28:04.678 --> 28:05.977
Lieutenant,
the 667 area code?

28:05.979 --> 28:07.228
I have no idea.

28:07.230 --> 28:09.630
Culiacan, Mexico.

28:11.367 --> 28:14.569
Maybe you want
to rethink your answer.

28:19.909 --> 28:22.277
You know, these call dates--
they're all from the time

28:22.279 --> 28:24.245
that Malia and I
were living together.

28:24.247 --> 28:26.197
That's a very convenient answer,

28:26.199 --> 28:30.001
and I guess lucky for you
that she can't confirm it.

28:32.571 --> 28:34.906
Something you want to add
to the record,

28:34.908 --> 28:37.175
Lieutenant?

28:45.334 --> 28:47.435
Malia knew
how I felt about her brother.

28:47.437 --> 28:49.354
If she really was
in contact with him,

28:49.356 --> 28:51.606
she would have been smart
not to tell me.

28:51.608 --> 28:53.925
So what you're telling us
is that your wife

28:53.927 --> 28:55.443
wanted to spare you the grief
of knowing

28:55.445 --> 28:57.062
that her brother
was an up-and-coming,

28:57.064 --> 28:58.863
drug-dealing, murderous thug.

28:58.865 --> 29:00.532
If she knew
what Gabriel was doing,

29:00.534 --> 29:02.901
you can be damn sure she would
have told me about that

29:02.903 --> 29:05.236
and then cut off communication
with him immediately!

29:05.238 --> 29:06.471
But she didn't, did she?

29:06.473 --> 29:09.290
I already told you,
she never said anything!

29:09.292 --> 29:11.743
I never saw, heard from,

29:11.745 --> 29:15.296
or even thought about Gabriel
Waincroft until five days ago!

29:16.916 --> 29:18.466
For the damn record.

29:18.468 --> 29:20.535
Duly noted.

29:25.141 --> 29:26.707
(clears throat)

29:29.211 --> 29:31.529
Tell us how you found Gabriel,
Lieutenant.

29:34.850 --> 29:37.652
Once we identified the warehouse
victim as Amos Koi,

29:37.654 --> 29:39.070
we went to his house.

29:39.072 --> 29:42.273
It had been tossed, and his wife
and kid were missing.

29:42.275 --> 29:43.742
We later tracked them down

29:43.744 --> 29:46.494
to a farmhouse near
Kualoa Valley.

You could have put the gun down.

36:37.793 --> 36:39.443
And gone to jail?

36:39.445 --> 36:41.028
No way.

36:41.030 --> 36:42.563
I don't do time.

36:42.565 --> 36:44.114
Well, you do now.

37:01.466 --> 37:03.367
(both grunting)

37:08.707 --> 37:12.476
Wait! I got $25 million in
an overseas bank account.

37:12.478 --> 37:16.380
It's yours. All you got to do is
just turn around and walk away.

37:16.382 --> 37:18.732
$25 million!

37:18.734 --> 37:20.401
That's more money than
you'll ever see

37:20.403 --> 37:22.369
in ten lifetimes
as a cop.

37:22.371 --> 37:23.437
(groans)

37:23.439 --> 37:25.272
What do you say, huh?

37:28.360 --> 37:30.560
You have the right
to remain silent.

37:30.562 --> 37:34.248
Anything you say can and will
be held against you.

37:34.250 --> 37:36.250
You have the right
to an attorney.

37:36.252 --> 37:37.701
(groans)

37:37.703 --> 37:39.286
If you cannot afford
an attorney,

37:39.288 --> 37:41.088
one will be appointed
for you.

37:41.090 --> 37:42.406
(grunts)

37:58.690 --> 38:01.859
Are you saying you weren't
tempted to take that money...

38:01.861 --> 38:04.695
even a little bit?

38:06.898 --> 38:08.982
I'm gonna pretend
you never asked me that.

38:08.984 --> 38:10.317
Hey, pretend
all you want,

38:10.319 --> 38:13.120
but that money, $25 million,
was never recovered.

38:13.122 --> 38:14.605
Answer the question, Lieutenant.

38:17.175 --> 38:18.792
We're done.
Fine.

38:18.794 --> 38:20.661
Any more questions,
we'll be in touch.

38:20.663 --> 38:21.662
Lieutenant...

38:21.664 --> 38:23.313
What?

38:23.315 --> 38:25.883
You've had quite a bit
of bad luck, haven't you?

38:27.469 --> 38:29.119
You say you're
a good cop,

38:29.121 --> 38:31.455
but trouble always seems
to find you somehow.

38:34.292 --> 38:36.877
You got something more
you want to say to me,

38:36.879 --> 38:40.130
you say it,
or shut the hell up.

38:43.301 --> 38:45.152
I'll catch you later.

39:07.709 --> 39:10.594
Commander,
we're ready for you.

39:37.322 --> 39:39.373
(seagulls calling)

39:54.756 --> 39:57.040
♪

40:09.220 --> 40:11.021
Sorry.

40:11.023 --> 40:12.389
That's mine.

40:20.949 --> 40:22.683
I'm Malia.

40:22.685 --> 40:24.668
Hi.

40:24.670 --> 40:26.620
I'm Chin Ho Kelly.

40:28.039 --> 40:32.092
So... what do you do,
Chin Ho Kelly?

40:32.094 --> 40:33.961
I'm a cop.

40:34.679 --> 40:37.130
Uh, I'm gonna be a cop.

40:37.132 --> 40:39.266
I'm in the academy.

40:39.268 --> 40:42.252
I'll bet you'll look really cute
in uniform.

40:43.972 --> 40:46.139
(chuckles)

40:47.091 --> 40:49.759
So, can I have
my board back now?

40:52.263 --> 40:55.365
Not unless you let me
take you to dinner.

40:58.536 --> 41:00.437
You can keep it.

41:04.909 --> 41:06.043
Wait, what?

41:06.045 --> 41:09.112
I'm sure I'll see you around.

41:09.114 --> 41:10.414
(laughs)

41:10.416 --> 41:13.783
Nice to meet you,
Chin Ho Kelly!
