00:03.546 --> 00:04.797
The trick to onions,

00:04.922 --> 00:07.758
cut them in half lengthwise,
but leave the roots on,

00:07.883 --> 00:10.928
then make your
vertical slices.

00:13.848 --> 00:15.850
I need a dozen.
Think you can handle this?

00:15.975 --> 00:17.268
A dozen is 12, right?

00:18.269 --> 00:23.691
Next, we add mustard greens,
spicy and they pack a nice punch.

00:23.816 --> 00:27.987
Plus, they're really
good for you, improve mental function,

00:28.112 --> 00:32.199
protect against rheumatoid arthritis,
even inhibit certain types of cancer.

00:33.034 --> 00:36.412
Are you going to chop those onions
or give them a Thai massage?

00:36.537 --> 00:39.290
Well, I guess a happy ending
is out of the question.

00:39.415 --> 00:43.919
I don't recall adding "making snide
remarks" to your list of duties.

00:46.005 --> 00:48.758

Porcini mushrooms.

00:48.883 --> 00:51.844
You want to reconstitute them
in a bowl of water.

00:51.969 --> 00:53.846
You also want to
hire an assistant

00:53.971 --> 00:55.765
who can stay focused
for longer than 30 seconds.

00:55.890 --> 00:58.809
- Why don't I hear you chopping?
- Just give me a second.

(COUGHS)

01:00.603 --> 01:02.521
- You're kidding me, right?
- So sorry.

01:02.646 --> 01:03.731
Are you okay?
You want to sit down?

01:03.856 --> 01:06.650

Cyanosis.

01:06.776 --> 01:10.821
(PANTING) Pain in my back and chest.
Spontaneous pneumothorax.

- I'm a doctor.

It was fine when
I came up from Admitting.

03:13.694 --> 03:16.989
Dana Miller, the cancer researcher,
spontaneous pneumothorax.

03:17.114 --> 03:18.449
Awfully thin file.

03:18.574 --> 03:20.034
She just got admitted.

03:20.326 --> 03:21.827
Lots of things can
cause pneumothorax.

03:21.952 --> 03:24.705
Why don't we let eight or 10 other
doctors rule out the boring stuff?

03:24.830 --> 03:25.873
We want to take this case.

03:26.040 --> 03:29.168
She's maybe five or 10 years away
from curing retinoblastoma.

03:29.293 --> 03:31.378
Which would make this case
attractive to anyone

03:31.503 --> 03:34.173
who has some vested interest in people
curing the incurable.

03:34.298 --> 03:36.050
She hasn't suffered
from COPD,

03:36.175 --> 03:38.177
she doesn't smoke,
she hasn't been scuba diving.

03:38.302 --> 03:40.638
O2 sats are low, even after
chest tube insertion.

03:40.763 --> 03:43.224
Pneumothorax could be secondary
to a bunch of things,

03:43.349 --> 03:45.267
cystic fibrosis,
lung cancer...

03:45.392 --> 03:47.019
Or to be slightly
more optimistic,

03:47.144 --> 03:49.271
late-onset asthma triggered
by an unknown allergen.

03:49.396 --> 03:50.356
We have a case?

03:50.481 --> 03:53.484
- Did you just get to work?
- Am I in trouble?

03:53.776 --> 03:55.277
Did you take
the elevators up?

03:55.402 --> 03:56.737
Yes.

03:56.862 --> 03:58.614
So, steroids for asthma?

03:59.573 --> 04:03.118
Yeah. Do a CT looking for
hyperinï¬‚ation to confirm.

04:09.416 --> 04:13.504
And I thought my hospital was high-tech.
Have to wait all day for a CT.

04:13.629 --> 04:15.339
Dr. House gets a few perks.

04:15.464 --> 04:17.341
He has his own scanner?

04:17.466 --> 04:20.719
No, just very loose interpretations
of hospital procedure.

the extra effort, but...

eight months ago.

04:35.442 --> 04:37.444
You mean like a sabbatical?

04:37.569 --> 04:40.030
I had a uterine myoma, benign,

04:40.155 --> 04:43.158
but it ruptured, and I needed
emergency surgery.

04:43.284 --> 04:45.327
I was lying there on the table thinking,

04:45.452 --> 04:47.830
"I can't die now,
I haven't been happy yet."

German sports car, or have an affair?

04:52.876 --> 04:56.880
My sports car is doing
what I want when I want.

how to run a kitchen

04:58.257 --> 05:00.676

05:00.801 --> 05:03.637
You're washing pots
and smashing garlic.

05:03.762 --> 05:05.639
Smashing garlic
makes me happy.

05:05.764 --> 05:08.976
Before that, it was eight years
studying, twelve years in that lab.

sometimes it just seems like
they're out to get you.

She keeps playing with the blanket.
Why would she do that?

05:45.721 --> 05:48.891
Why do you think the elevators
would be out to get me?

05:49.016 --> 05:49.850
I don't know.

05:49.975 --> 05:54.480
Maybe they wanted to take time off to
spend with their little dumbwaiter,

05:54.605 --> 05:56.732
but then they had to leave it at home
with an elevator sitter

05:56.857 --> 06:00.736
because you drove the replacement
elevator to quitting

06:00.861 --> 06:03.572
because you're incapable
of listening to anybody but me.

06:03.989 --> 06:04.990
It's just a theory.

06:05.115 --> 06:07.785
You're wrong.
I don't even listen to you.

Either do your job or go home.
Leave me out of it.

06:10.496 --> 06:13.749
I am going to do my job. It doesn't mean
I have to do it happily,

06:13.874 --> 06:15.417
doesn't mean I have to do it
without resentment,

06:15.542 --> 06:17.086
and it definitely doesn't
mean I have to do it

Nope. Anybody bother MRI-ing
our patient's liver for tumors?

No tumors, no cysts,
no clear etiology.

11:35.654 --> 11:39.616
If you're not obsessing,
you must have already figured it out.

11:40.659 --> 11:43.537
Yes. So I'm obsessing about
why you're not obsessing

11:43.662 --> 11:46.707
about why our patient's liver
suddenly sprang a leak.

11:46.832 --> 11:50.043
There's a tiny spot on the caudate lobe.
Could be a granuloma.

11:50.794 --> 11:53.505
Erodes into the hepatic artery,
causes the bleed.

11:53.630 --> 11:54.965
What caused the granuloma?

11:55.090 --> 11:56.800
Blastomycosis.

11:56.925 --> 11:58.635
Could've been
asymptomatic for months.

11:58.760 --> 12:03.348
It hits her lungs, we give her steroids,
it blossoms and attacks her liver.

Get a piece of her lung,
stick it under a black light.

You have a problem.

12:20.782 --> 12:21.700
I told you. I didn't...

12:21.825 --> 12:23.785
Then you really
have a problem.

12:24.536 --> 12:26.705
When she turned her head
to look at the MRI,

12:26.830 --> 12:29.040
I think she's losing
her peripheral vision.

12:29.166 --> 12:31.251
Because she turned
her head?

12:31.376 --> 12:32.627
I'm happy for you.

12:33.211 --> 12:36.089
A love so deep you're ready to chuck
your medical license

12:36.214 --> 12:40.343

with dangerous side effects.

No carpet bombing, no burning of Dresden

Well, since you're incapable
of taking the high road,

13:13.168 --> 13:17.589
I assume there's some deeper,
more long-term strategy in effect.

13:17.714 --> 13:21.468
Cuddy's not playing games,
she's not looking for leverage.

13:21.593 --> 13:24.262

And your countermove
is to let her have it?

13:26.848 --> 13:29.392
The only time to strike back
is when I want something.

13:29.518 --> 13:32.312
All I want now is to get things
back to normal,

13:32.437 --> 13:33.897
which I can't get
by escalating.

13:34.022 --> 13:39.277
The only way to win this war is to
lose it. Let her punch herself out.

13:39.402 --> 13:41.863
Yeah, that makes sense, too.

13:41.988 --> 13:42.823
Too?

13:42.948 --> 13:47.285
I was thinking you actually feel guilty
about taking her away from her baby,

13:47.410 --> 13:49.037
but your explanation
is good, too.

13:49.162 --> 13:52.791
It's completely inconsistent
with your character, but whatever.

13:52.916 --> 13:56.628
Oh, thank you, Rationalization Man,
you have saved the village.

13:57.254 --> 13:59.297
You wanna eat?

13:59.422 --> 14:00.757
You forgot your file.

14:02.467 --> 14:06.513
Dana Miller?
The cancer researcher?

14:06.638 --> 14:07.848
Not anymore.

14:16.940 --> 14:18.859
Dr. Miller, I doubt
if you'll remember me...

14:18.984 --> 14:20.277
James Wilson, right?

14:20.402 --> 14:22.737
Chicago, at the
adenocarcinoma conference?

14:22.863 --> 14:24.072
Impressive.

14:25.824 --> 14:27.617
You want some cortisone
for that itch?

14:27.742 --> 14:31.538
Liver failure, itching is one
of the lovely side effects.

14:33.498 --> 14:34.875
Wâ€œ)! did you quit?

14:35.500 --> 14:37.752
Well, the worst thing is,
now, every time I get sick,

14:37.878 --> 14:40.297
I have to listen
to a dozen people judge me.

14:40.422 --> 14:42.257
Do you want me
to congratulate you?

14:43.592 --> 14:46.219
I've got four kids in Pede-Onc
right now who are going to die.

14:46.344 --> 14:49.306
Three of them within a year,
the other in a few days, probably.

14:49.431 --> 14:50.974
Breakthroughs will happen.

14:51.099 --> 14:53.935
With or without me,
someone will find the answer.

14:54.060 --> 14:55.020
Maybe.

14:56.396 --> 14:57.939
(SCOFFS)

14:59.065 --> 15:02.485
I'm in the trenches.
I'm doing triage as best I can.

15:02.611 --> 15:04.654
You had the chance
to end the war.

15:06.489 --> 15:08.658
How is someone like me
supposed to keep fighting

15:08.783 --> 15:11.953
when someone like you
just walked away?

15:13.747 --> 15:17.876
When I left my job, a lot of people
were furious with me.

15:18.001 --> 15:21.087
It was easier to be angry
than to admit they weren't happy.

15:22.255 --> 15:25.008
That they were stuck
in a rut somewhere in their lives,

15:25.133 --> 15:26.384
unable to move forward.

15:28.219 --> 15:29.638
What's your rut?

15:35.352 --> 15:36.937
(MAN CHATTERING ON TV)

15:41.983 --> 15:44.402
Okay, you're
freaking me out.

15:45.153 --> 15:46.947
Do you think
we should have kids?

15:53.995 --> 15:55.497
We've had
this conversation.

15:55.622 --> 15:58.667
Ten years ago.
Things change.

15:58.792 --> 16:01.419
On our third date, I told you
that I didn't want to have kids,

16:01.544 --> 16:03.463
and you said that
you were okay with that.

16:03.588 --> 16:05.715
I said it because
I wanted to sleep with you.

16:05.840 --> 16:07.842
And then
I fell in love with you,

16:07.968 --> 16:11.012
and I realized
that I really could be okay with it.

16:12.597 --> 16:15.892
It wasn't like I had
this burning desire to have children.

16:16.017 --> 16:18.603
God, have you been resenting me
all this time? Is that why...

16:18.728 --> 16:21.481
No, of course not.

16:23.817 --> 16:26.861
I'm just revisiting.

16:31.241 --> 16:36.413
This isn't a whim for me.
It's not a decision that I made lightly.

16:36.538 --> 16:38.748
Don't you ever wonder
what it would be like?

16:38.873 --> 16:40.000
All the time.

16:42.419 --> 16:44.713
But just not enough
to make me want to do it.

16:45.672 --> 16:47.340
I like our life.

16:51.803 --> 16:53.179
Are you okay?

16:55.682 --> 16:57.267
Can I turn
the TV back on?

17:15.243 --> 17:16.619
Look straight ahead.

17:17.162 --> 17:18.371
(CHUCKLES)

17:18.496 --> 17:20.749
Why didn't we do
this test this morning?

17:21.374 --> 17:23.460
- Do you see that?
- No.

17:24.586 --> 17:27.630
- Damn.
- I'm losing my peripheral vision?

17:32.677 --> 17:33.970
I am on the drug.

17:35.972 --> 17:39.642
Does this mean you have to tell them
and take me off it?

17:40.351 --> 17:42.854
No and yes.

17:43.855 --> 17:46.274
As far as they're concerned,
you're on the placebo.

17:46.399 --> 17:50.236
I found out last week.
The trial was getting positive results,

17:52.572 --> 17:53.782
so I switched you.

17:56.785 --> 17:58.453
So my headaches...

18:02.999 --> 18:05.919
I'll stop taking the drug
and everything should be fine.

18:12.342 --> 18:14.844
Specimen's negative
for blastomycosis.

18:14.969 --> 18:16.262
That's it?

18:17.305 --> 18:20.308
I'll go give House the test results.
You can tell the patient.

18:20.934 --> 18:22.143
Hey.

18:25.897 --> 18:27.816
We have been dating
for two weeks.

18:28.983 --> 18:33.571
You just broke trial protocol
and risked your entire career

18:33.696 --> 18:36.699
to give me a drug
we're not even sure will help me.

18:38.910 --> 18:40.870
I don't think
I'm ready for that.

18:49.796 --> 18:50.880
Dr. Miller?

18:54.175 --> 18:58.138
I'm sorry. The test was negative.
So, I'm gonna take you off...

18:58.972 --> 19:00.181
What happened to your head?

19:00.306 --> 19:02.183
I don't know,
I was sleeping.

19:02.308 --> 19:04.060
It's so itchy.

19:04.185 --> 19:06.187
You were scratching it
in your sleep.

19:06.604 --> 19:07.897
(SIGHS)

19:08.940 --> 19:10.733
You scratched right through your skull.

19:10.859 --> 19:12.944
- What?
- This is brain matter.

19:13.111 --> 19:14.195
Oh, God.

19:14.904 --> 19:16.114
Need some help in here.

19:18.783 --> 19:20.994
I did a free flap closure
to avoid any scarring.

19:21.119 --> 19:23.496
She was lucky, the scratching
didn't cause any brain damage.

19:23.621 --> 19:24.455
But the first thing she said

19:24.581 --> 19:27.208
when we woke her up was,
"it still itches."

19:27.333 --> 19:31.004
Itch receptors are only
in the top two layers of skin,

19:31.129 --> 19:33.590
which means she's not actually itchy,
she just thinks she is.

19:33.715 --> 19:34.632
So the problem's
in her brain.

19:34.757 --> 19:37.302
Thank God we have you here
to interpret that for us.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.889
Sorry. I have a headache.

19:41.014 --> 19:42.056
KUTNER: It could be psychogenic.

19:42.182 --> 19:43.683
She made a big,
sudden change in her life,

19:43.808 --> 19:45.894
could be the
result of a mental imbalance.

19:46.019 --> 19:48.605
She wants to do what she wants to do,
what's crazy about that?

19:48.730 --> 19:51.274
Why do you have to quit to do it?
If I want to do something, I do it.

19:51.399 --> 19:53.610
If you can figure out a balance,
there's no burn out.

19:53.735 --> 19:55.069
Thanks for the lesson,
Deepak,

19:55.195 --> 19:57.989
but the itching started yesterday,
not eight months ago.

19:58.114 --> 19:59.949
Meningitis, encephalitis.

20:00.074 --> 20:02.118
Those are diffuse processes,
this is localized.

20:02.243 --> 20:05.914
Could be plaques, MS would explain
the itching, possibly the lungs.

20:06.039 --> 20:07.165
So would a brain tumor.

20:07.290 --> 20:10.210
Well, how about we stop guessing
and MRI her head instead?

20:33.524 --> 20:36.361
- You want to talk about your headaches?
- Not particularly.

20:38.029 --> 20:42.700
You went off the drug, but the headaches
are worse. You need an MRI.

20:42.825 --> 20:43.993
The patient needs an MRI.

20:44.118 --> 20:46.955
If she had gangrene, would you be
amputating my leg?

20:47.080 --> 20:51.000
These pills have codeine in them? You're
taking twice the indicated amount.

20:51.125 --> 20:53.044
I've only been off the drug
for 24 hours.

20:53.169 --> 20:56.422
So I think the bigger issue here is that
I've been off you for 24 hours.

20:56.547 --> 20:58.925
You have worsening headaches,
loss of peripheral vision,

20:59.050 --> 21:02.011
and a long history of pretending
bad things aren't happening.

21:02.136 --> 21:04.889
You really think
this is just about my hurt feelings?

21:15.692 --> 21:18.611
- I don't remember demoting you.
- Brought you something.

21:18.736 --> 21:22.282
Latest issue of Parent magazine.
Really interesting column.

21:22.407 --> 21:25.702
Apparently, working moms
are actually more engaged and attentive

21:25.827 --> 21:28.997
than stay-at-home moms.
Something about personal fulfillment.

21:29.122 --> 21:29.956
That's just a rationalization

21:30.081 --> 21:32.458
by working moms who justify
not being with their kids,

21:32.583 --> 21:35.962
which is fine, if that's what they want.
It's not what I want.

21:36.087 --> 21:37.672
And this is

21:37.797 --> 21:39.924

- You're only here to get back at me

21:40.049 --> 21:42.135
by dumping dirty mop
water on my carpet.

21:42.260 --> 21:45.054
Just get it over with
so I can get back to work.

22:07.243 --> 22:08.703
I'm sorry.

22:10.330 --> 22:11.748
I figured

22:12.248 --> 22:14.959
only one of us needed to go
out on a limb.

22:17.253 --> 22:19.130
I thought! could help you.

22:20.006 --> 22:23.885
It's hard to have a conversation
when I'm trying not to move.

22:25.386 --> 22:26.971
(BEEPS)

22:31.184 --> 22:32.560
Oh, God.

22:34.103 --> 22:37.148
Patient's MRI was negative,
no tumors, no lesions.

22:37.273 --> 22:39.692
- Where's your cane?
- Where are your co-workers?

22:39.817 --> 22:41.903
- I paged them.
- It could still be psychogenic.

22:42.028 --> 22:45.031
Technically, it can't still be that
because it never could be that.

22:45.156 --> 22:47.658
She scratched through her skull
while she was sleeping.

22:47.784 --> 22:49.911
Unless she was having
a dream about fleas...

22:50.036 --> 22:52.246
Oh, hey, funny
you should drop by.

22:52.372 --> 22:54.582
We were just talking
about this patient of ours.

22:54.707 --> 22:57.085
Tell him the part about where two
of her doctors don't show up for...

22:57.210 --> 22:58.378
Where are you going?

22:58.503 --> 23:01.047
Polyneuropathy. If it's not
in the brain, it's in the nerves.

23:01.172 --> 23:02.757
Explains the itching,
the lungs, the liver.

23:02.882 --> 23:05.968
Shock the affected area,
re-boot the nerves, she'll be fine.

23:06.761 --> 23:07.845
Foreman.

23:11.015 --> 23:12.767
How bad is she?

23:16.896 --> 23:19.190
She's got a tumor
in her optic chiasm.

23:20.983 --> 23:22.860
You don't need your coat
to treat a tumor.

23:22.985 --> 23:24.779
I'm going to
the drug company.

23:24.904 --> 23:27.865
To tell them that you compromised
their trial, your ethics,

23:27.990 --> 23:29.826
and the patient's health.
That's a great idea.

23:29.951 --> 23:32.912
They have records
on hundreds of patients.

23:33.037 --> 23:33.913
I can ask them for access,

23:34.038 --> 23:36.874
find out if other patients developed
tumors and how they were treated.

23:36.999 --> 23:38.668
This drug inhibits
cell death.

23:38.793 --> 23:40.753
I think I can take
a wild guess on how I treat that.

23:40.878 --> 23:45.091
Stop taking it?
Yeah, she tried that yesterday.

23:45.216 --> 23:48.428
Oh, my God. It's been a whole day and
her brain tumor hasn't melted away?

and it's only 'cause you're worried
about getting to sleep tonight...

23:54.267 --> 23:55.435
I want to be able
to tell her

23:55.560 --> 23:57.687
this happened to other people,
and they're fine now.

23:57.812 --> 23:59.147
So tell her.

23:59.272 --> 24:01.858
- I'm not going to lie to her.
- A little late for that.

24:05.153 --> 24:06.487
You need to wait.

24:06.863 --> 24:08.489
Because if this thing
doesn't go away,

24:08.614 --> 24:11.367
she's going to need you
to still have a medical license.

24:15.288 --> 24:18.833
So I spoke with House.
He thinks we should just...

24:18.958 --> 24:21.461
- My leg is bleeding.
- What happened?

24:21.586 --> 24:25.339

and I fell over the table.

I can't see.

24:29.343 --> 24:30.720

Don't tell me. She burned
your apartment to the ground.

No heat, no power.

utilities and told them we were moving.

25:08.758 --> 25:10.927
You have 17 messages.

25:11.052 --> 25:15.014
And your non-involvement strategy
doesn't seem to be working.

Hang up. He's here.

25:24.482 --> 25:25.608
We've been
paging you all night.

25:25.733 --> 25:29.195
By all means, let's discuss the failed
attempts to contact me,

25:29.320 --> 25:31.405
not the reason
behind them.

25:31.531 --> 25:33.157
The patient started
experiencing spinal shocks

25:33.282 --> 25:36.536
before the machine was turned on.
Lhermitte's sign.

25:36.661 --> 25:40.039
Shocks without shock,

She needs Dr. Seuss.

25:41.499 --> 25:44.126

25:50.049 --> 25:52.843
Why are you asking about Foreman
and not Thirteen?

25:52.969 --> 25:56.389
Because both questions
are bound to have the same answer.

26:00.977 --> 26:03.187

the liver or the lungs.

answer the door.

26:26.043 --> 26:28.462

to talk to anyone.

You can leave your stolen key

I was looking for Foreman.
I figured...

26:37.263 --> 26:38.681
You can't see.

- Where is he?
- On his way to the drug company.

radiation, not ritual sacrifice.

26:59.201 --> 27:03.789
He asked for my advice
before he switched you off the placebo.

27:03.914 --> 27:06.667
I told him to do it
if he loved you.

27:07.376 --> 27:09.503
He only thinks
he loves me.

27:10.129 --> 27:13.758
It's the same thing.
Yes, he's an idiot.

27:13.883 --> 27:15.885
You didn't ask him to do anything,
you're pissed off that he did.

27:16.010 --> 27:19.221
So let him torch his career
to pay for his sins,

27:20.514 --> 27:23.934
unless you actually
feel something for the idiot,

27:26.520 --> 27:30.107
in which case, you might want to
tell him to turn around.

27:38.991 --> 27:40.493
(SIGHING)

27:44.163 --> 27:45.539
WILSON:
You're hurting him.

27:45.956 --> 27:48.084
Good, after all the stunts
he's pulled on me.

27:48.250 --> 27:50.169
You're physically
hurting him.

27:50.294 --> 27:52.088
(SIGHS)
That's the point.

27:52.213 --> 27:53.839
What's the point?

27:53.964 --> 27:55.758
What do you think you're going
to accomplish?

27:56.217 --> 27:58.302
House shouldn't be allowed
to make people miserable

27:58.427 --> 28:00.096
- without paying for it.
- You're not miserable.

28:00.221 --> 28:01.847
You're telling me
how I feel?

28:01.972 --> 28:05.518
You're here because you like this,
you like working with him.

28:05.643 --> 28:07.603
Wow, if only I'd known
I was having fun,

28:07.728 --> 28:09.438
I wouldn't have
canceled the bouncy house.

28:09.563 --> 28:12.525
Fire him.
And go be home with your new baby.

28:13.192 --> 28:15.236
I like what he does
for this hospital.

28:15.611 --> 28:18.572
What he does is who he is.

28:18.698 --> 28:20.616
And the same goes for you.

28:29.417 --> 28:30.626
Slow down.

28:32.086 --> 28:34.672
Unless you want to radiate her heart
instead of her brain.

28:34.797 --> 28:37.049
Of course, then your problems
would actually all go away.

28:37.174 --> 28:40.928
Thanks. I'm not beating myself up
enough already over this.

28:42.221 --> 28:44.223
Entering the left
common carotid.

28:44.390 --> 28:48.102
You broke the rules,
your girlfriend went blind.

28:48.227 --> 28:51.647
You gotta be ready for losing
to be one of the possibilities.

28:51.939 --> 28:53.399
You're at
the carotid bifurcation.

28:53.524 --> 28:56.527
I knew that giving her the drug
would be bad for me if I got caught.

28:56.652 --> 28:59.405
I never thought
it would be bad for her.

28:59.530 --> 29:01.741
Nobody else was having
adverse reactions.

29:01.866 --> 29:03.909
You did it because
you love her,

29:04.034 --> 29:07.413
and, ironically, you never took her
into consideration.

29:08.038 --> 29:11.000
I can't wait to see what you get her
for your anniversary.

29:13.502 --> 29:16.589
Catheter's adjacent to the optic chiasm.
We're in position.

29:25.973 --> 29:27.558
Nukie-nukie.

29:37.818 --> 29:39.695
What's going on
with everyone today?

29:39.820 --> 29:42.114
It involves House,
Foreman, and Thirteen,

29:42.239 --> 29:46.118
which means it's either dumb, dangerous,
or tragic, or a combination.

29:46.243 --> 29:48.078
I'm embracing
my ignorance.

29:48.204 --> 29:51.749
House was right about the hemangioma,
looks fixable.

29:53.375 --> 29:54.960
What's that?

29:55.085 --> 29:58.923
Hemangiomas travel solo.
This thing's brought a friend.

29:59.048 --> 30:02.885
Masses in her lungs and spine.
One in her pericardium.

30:03.010 --> 30:03.969
They're everywhere.

30:08.265 --> 30:10.142
Classic mesothelioma.

30:10.267 --> 30:12.812
It metastasized outward
to the spine and muscles.

30:12.937 --> 30:16.023
The irony of it.
Maybe she wouldn't be sick at all

30:16.148 --> 30:19.819
if some other lazy cancer researcher
hadn't gone home early.

30:19.944 --> 30:21.529
Where are Foreman
and Thirteen?

30:22.822 --> 30:23.823
Shouldn't you be saying,

30:23.948 --> 30:26.158
"Those weren't there when we scanned
her two days ago"?

30:26.283 --> 30:29.328
- Mesothelioma shouldn't grow this fast.
- Good rephrasing.

30:29.453 --> 30:32.957
Have Wilson do
a biopsy to confirm.

30:33.082 --> 30:34.124
No.

30:35.084 --> 30:36.335
Something weird is going on,

30:36.460 --> 30:38.504
and it involves our colleagues,
we should know.

30:38.629 --> 30:40.840
You want us to treat the patient?
Tell us what's going on.

30:40.965 --> 30:42.550
Actually, all he
needs us to do

30:42.675 --> 30:45.469
is tell Wilson
to do something. So...

30:48.931 --> 30:51.100
You always blab
to watch people react,

30:51.225 --> 30:54.562
so not blabbing means you don't want us
to react, which can't be good.

30:54.687 --> 30:57.565
Is Thirteen's headache
not just a headache?

30:57.690 --> 31:00.150
If I check with Admitting,
am I going to find her name?

31:02.736 --> 31:04.113
Little pinch.

31:11.787 --> 31:15.583
I'm sorry about the other day.
I unloaded on you and...

31:15.708 --> 31:17.167
You're not sorry.

31:18.294 --> 31:21.714
You feel bad because mesothelioma
means I'm dying.

31:21.839 --> 31:24.091
You're a good person.
I appreciate the sentiment.

31:24.216 --> 31:26.093
I'm not apologizing
because you're dying.

31:26.218 --> 31:30.139
I'm apologizing
because you were right. I am stuck.

31:33.058 --> 31:34.226
My girlfriend died.

31:34.351 --> 31:37.271
She was the only person
I've loved for a long time and...

31:38.480 --> 31:42.526
I'm still living in her apartment.
I'm surrounded by her things.

31:42.651 --> 31:44.653
(CHUCKLES) I've left it
all exactly where it was.

31:48.949 --> 31:50.743
I don't know how
to get un-stuck.

31:52.161 --> 31:55.748
The only wrong thing
is to do nothing.

32:00.920 --> 32:02.004
Yeah.

32:05.758 --> 32:07.009
All right.

32:13.891 --> 32:15.726
That's not supposed
to happen.

32:23.943 --> 32:27.696
Have you thought about going to
the drug company, see if they can help?

32:27.821 --> 32:28.864
I thought about it.

32:28.989 --> 32:31.492
We need to give it more time,
it's been half a day.

32:31.617 --> 32:32.910
This thing keeps growing,

32:33.035 --> 32:35.788
there's other stuff in your brain
you might need later on.

32:35.913 --> 32:39.625
If I were any other patient, you'd both
be in the lounge eating donuts.

32:39.750 --> 32:42.378
- You're not any other patient.
- Right.

32:43.087 --> 32:45.255
Any other patient,
you don't feel guilty.

32:46.507 --> 32:49.885
But you don't get to torch your career
to pay for your sins.

32:50.844 --> 32:53.055
House told you
to say that, didn't he?

32:53.180 --> 32:55.975
Does that make it
any less true?

32:56.558 --> 32:59.353
- You think he's right?
- Who cares?

32:59.561 --> 33:01.063
You're a hypocrite.

33:01.605 --> 33:03.440
You don't ask her if she wants
to be on the drug,

33:03.565 --> 33:05.150
but when there's a chance
you could help her get better,

33:05.275 --> 33:07.486
suddenly you're letting her
call the shots?

33:08.112 --> 33:11.198
That's not being noble,
that's saving your own ass.

33:12.908 --> 33:15.869
I'd feel worse if he
destroyed his career.

33:19.164 --> 33:21.041
Mesothelioma doesn't bleed.

33:21.166 --> 33:23.127
So what causes
masses that do bleed?

33:23.252 --> 33:25.170
AVM secondary
to schistosomiasis.

33:25.295 --> 33:27.256
She'd be crawling with worms,
we would've noticed it.

33:27.381 --> 33:29.049
Gorham's Disease
and Kasabach-Merritt

33:29.174 --> 33:32.011
can both cause super-aggressive
vascular tumors.

smothering her heart. Syringe.

everything to try to keep her stable.

34:07.379 --> 34:09.298
But we can barely keep up
with the blood loss.

34:09.423 --> 34:11.341
At this rate, she could be dead
by the end of the day.

34:11.467 --> 34:14.428
KUTNER: We need to resect
the vascular tumors, stop the bleeding.

34:14.553 --> 34:17.514
Too late.
No surgeon's going to touch her now.

34:18.015 --> 34:21.810
- So we give up? Just let her bleed out?
- Don't be silly.

34:21.935 --> 34:25.022
Do you know what that would do to our
malpractice insurance rates?

34:25.147 --> 34:28.609
We go on the offensive, cut off
the invading army's supply line.

34:28.734 --> 34:30.402
You're talking
about embolization?

34:30.569 --> 34:34.490
Cut off the arteries that feed blood
to the tumors, they wither and die.

34:34.615 --> 34:36.492
Start with the ones
in her lungs,

34:36.617 --> 34:38.952
'cause if they get any bigger,
she's gonna have a hard time breathing,

34:39.078 --> 34:41.038
so she'll have a hard time
telling us she's dead.

34:41.163 --> 34:43.582
You can't kill the tumors
without also killing healthy tissue.

34:43.707 --> 34:45.667
If we wipe out
three-quarters of her lungs...

34:45.793 --> 34:48.962

wasn't on her happy list.

where I hid it.

35:10.025 --> 35:14.029
I thought I'd never see you again,
Little Little Greg.

35:15.114 --> 35:16.907
Yeah, you heard me right.

35:23.122 --> 35:24.873
You are who you are.

35:25.541 --> 35:28.418
It's annoying,
but that's not your fault.

35:29.461 --> 35:31.255
It isn't about you.

35:34.091 --> 35:35.300
I'm sorry.

35:35.968 --> 35:39.680
Because you were doing this job
perfectly until the baby came along.

35:39.805 --> 35:41.056
What?

35:42.349 --> 35:44.351
I'm apologizing.
Can't you just accept my...

35:44.476 --> 35:46.061
I accept.

35:46.186 --> 35:49.231
Are we gonna have
to do this dance again in 28 days?

35:49.356 --> 35:50.774
What the hell
is wrong with you?

35:50.899 --> 35:54.778
Yesterday, you hate me. Today, you're
practically weeping on my shoulder.

35:54.903 --> 35:59.032
I can only assume that what I'm hearing
is your Aunt Flow telling me...

36:07.666 --> 36:09.710
When I was being a jerk,
you suddenly act human,

36:09.835 --> 36:12.462
but when I act human,
you turn back into a jerk.

36:12.588 --> 36:14.673
Guess our cycles
aren't matched up yet.

36:16.008 --> 36:19.178
This is your way of saying you accept
my apology, isn't it?

36:19.303 --> 36:22.389
Nope. This is my way of saying
you were doing a crappy job before,

36:22.514 --> 36:25.684
you'll do a slightly crappier job now,
everything keeps going.

36:25.809 --> 36:28.437
Nature of life,
nature of parenthood.

36:32.274 --> 36:34.109
Or this whole thing
is just an act.

36:34.234 --> 36:37.696
And you've gone back
to the part you think you need to play.

36:39.198 --> 36:40.824
You should go
talk to Wilson.

36:56.465 --> 36:59.009
House, if you're looking
for returnable bottles,

36:59.134 --> 37:03.055
- Kutner's already cleaned it out.
- Damn! Oh, well,

37:03.722 --> 37:07.726
it means the only thing I'm gonna
get out of this is a diagnosis.

37:09.186 --> 37:11.480
So the nurses gave her pads
instead of tampons,

37:11.605 --> 37:12.773
is that diagnostically
relevant?

37:12.898 --> 37:15.108
The fact that the nurses
had to give her anything is.

37:15.234 --> 37:17.236
It means she's bleeding
from her uterus.

37:17.361 --> 37:20.280
Women do that. It's perfectly natural,
not scary at all.

37:20.405 --> 37:23.867
She's menstruating
and she's bleeding everywhere.

37:23.992 --> 37:26.995
There's about a three- or four-in-28
chance it's a coincidence.

37:27.120 --> 37:31.583
Which leaves a much bigger chance that
the diagnosis is ectopic endometriosis.

37:31.708 --> 37:35.587
She had a myoma eight months ago. The
surgeons cut through her uterine wall.

37:35.712 --> 37:36.964
Every cut of the scalpel

37:37.089 --> 37:40.592
could have sent endometrial cells
spilling out into her bloodstream.

37:40.717 --> 37:42.177
Some of them took up
residence in her lungs,

37:42.302 --> 37:43.971
some in her liver,
some in her spine.

37:44.096 --> 37:46.306
And like all
horny little cells,

37:46.431 --> 37:49.768
they went forth and multiplied until
they reached a critical mass.

37:49.893 --> 37:51.687
In the days leading up
to her next period,

37:51.812 --> 37:54.815
when her uterus is supposed to swell,
everything swelled.

37:54.940 --> 37:57.859
Then when her uterus was supposed
to bleed, everything bled.

37:59.653 --> 38:04.366
Yes, ladies, I am blaming her period.
Granted, it's the worst period ever.

38:04.491 --> 38:06.827
Although, frankly,
not by all that much.

38:06.952 --> 38:08.870
Cut out the masses,
she'll be fine.

38:08.996 --> 38:11.915
Can't do surgery until her cycle's over
and she stops bleeding.

38:12.040 --> 38:14.001
Let's hope she can
hold out until then.

In the meantime, get her
a pint of cookie dough ice cream

39:35.415 --> 39:37.167
I always worry on my deathbed

39:37.292 --> 39:40.879
I'll think, "I didn't do
anything really important."

39:41.004 --> 39:43.965
You're gonna spend
one day of your life on your deathbed.

39:44.091 --> 39:47.094

41:04.087 --> 41:07.674
They'll come after me if I attempt
to participate in any more trials.

41:08.592 --> 41:10.051
That's very decent of them.

41:11.845 --> 41:16.016
Well, good for me.
See you tomorrow.

41:17.976 --> 41:21.271
And the next day.
And the next day.

41:23.315 --> 41:25.817
That wasn't your locker, was it?

41:25.942 --> 41:29.863
It's a locker room.
How else are they gonna learn?

41:44.461 --> 41:47.172
Do you think
you can't be happy without a kid?

41:48.840 --> 41:49.966
I don't know.

41:53.512 --> 41:56.056
I know I can't
be happy without you.

42:26.795 --> 42:28.004
You snore.

42:29.130 --> 42:30.507
Shut up.
