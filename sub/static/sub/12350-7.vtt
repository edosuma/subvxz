01:04.050 --> 01:05.721
I rented it on Virtual Slumber.

01:05.722 --> 01:06.881
It probably belongs to some euro

01:06.882 --> 01:12.533
oligarch who uses it to launder
money, and they left us wine.

01:14.174 --> 01:16.253

Thanks.

02:59.955 --> 03:01.690
I was... I was late.

03:01.691 --> 03:02.994
I was early.

03:04.914 --> 03:06.185
It's good to see you.

03:08.153 --> 03:11.066
I'm afraid this is more of a
coffee favor than a catch-up.

03:11.067 --> 03:12.176
Oh, okay.

03:12.577 --> 03:14.096
What's going on?

03:15.209 --> 03:17.850
An old intern of mine has
gotten into a weird situation.

03:18.151 --> 03:19.593
It's actually kind of terrifying

03:19.594 --> 03:21.981
and he's refusing to go to the
police.

03:21.982 --> 03:23.297
What happened?

03:23.298 --> 03:25.477
I think he should tell you
himself.

03:30.653 --> 03:32.373
It was supposed to be fun.

03:32.374 --> 03:34.318
I wanted to make Beth feel
special.

03:34.319 --> 03:36.333
She only gets to visit me every
month or so.

03:36.934 --> 03:39.301
You know, it wasn't exactly
cheap, either.

03:39.302 --> 03:42.109
Neither of you remember
anything else about that night?

03:42.110 --> 03:44.202
Not after we fell asleep, no.

03:46.477 --> 03:48.598
Somebody must've drugged us.

03:48.599 --> 03:50.525
There was wine.

03:50.526 --> 03:52.422
We drank that.

03:52.423 --> 03:57.409
The next morning, Beth was out
cold and I...

03:58.313 --> 03:59.833
What?

03:59.834 --> 04:02.482
I woke up with this.

04:07.425 --> 04:09.032
You need to see a doctor.

04:09.033 --> 04:10.545
Beth and I went to one.

04:10.546 --> 04:12.601
I was more worried that
she was okay,

04:12.602 --> 04:15.625
but nothing was done to her.

04:15.626 --> 04:16.962
Nothing?

04:16.963 --> 04:18.241
No.

04:18.242 --> 04:20.081
Except she's totally freaked.

04:20.082 --> 04:21.709
Who would do this?

04:21.709 --> 04:23.069
Iluxa Electronic.

04:23.615 --> 04:24.645
They booked the apartment
online.

04:24.646 --> 04:27.381
I thought maybe you could see who came
in and out of the apartment.

04:28.357 --> 04:29.518
You should go to the police.

04:29.519 --> 04:31.108
You don't understand.

04:31.109 --> 04:32.406
I'm this close to getting

04:32.407 --> 04:35.141
offered the job of a lifetime
with Jake's law firm.

04:35.142 --> 04:36.973
They do thorough background
checks.

04:36.974 --> 04:40.749
You know how humiliating it would
be if anyone found out about this?

04:41.150 --> 04:43.190
Jake's the only one there I
trust.

04:43.191 --> 04:44.997
He's got a point.

04:46.189 --> 04:48.273
Okay, I can't force you to
file a complaint,

04:49.074 --> 04:50.450
but what about your girlfriend?

04:50.451 --> 04:52.042
She's okay with this decision?

04:52.043 --> 04:53.506
Yes.

04:55.026 --> 04:56.466
Please.

04:57.067 --> 04:59.214
Jake says you can help us.

05:03.529 --> 05:07.085
Okay.
I'll see what I can find out.

05:08.186 --> 05:10.234
I still think Nick should go to
the police.

05:10.235 --> 05:13.502
Maybe they can figure out if it's
a sick prank or something first.

05:13.503 --> 05:15.345
I promise if it's anything more,
then...

05:15.346 --> 05:17.397
I'll take it to the Cyber Crimes Unit.

05:17.765 --> 05:19.037
Yeah.

05:19.038 --> 05:22.629
Hey, look.
I want to apologize.

05:23.725 --> 05:25.470
I know I bailed on our last date
because of work,

05:25.471 --> 05:28.205
which is a terrible excuse and now I'm
coming to you with a favor.

05:28.806 --> 05:30.973
- It's okay.
- No, it's not.

05:32.274 --> 05:33.861
I really like you.

05:35.565 --> 05:37.997
This isn't exactly how I wanted
things to go.

05:39.702 --> 05:41.750
So how did you want it to go?

05:56.706 --> 05:57.903
Kinda like that.

05:58.936 --> 06:01.128
Yeah.
Okay.

06:01.129 --> 06:03.595
After this case is closed,

06:03.596 --> 06:06.839
I am making it up to you.
We're doing dinner.

06:06.840 --> 06:08.219
No more cooking.

06:08.220 --> 06:09.452
What, you don't like my cooking?

06:09.453 --> 06:10.467
It's just...

06:10.468 --> 06:13.491
There are places in New York
that can actually cook for you.

06:14.092 --> 06:16.379
Oh, I did hear that somewhere.

06:19.258 --> 06:23.355
Thanks for helping.
I mean it, you're incredible.

06:30.108 --> 06:31.299
(Tape rewinding)

06:32.700 --> 06:34.675
<i>How did that taste, Lindy?</i>

06:43.095 --> 06:46.447
<i>Other guys don't understand you.</i>

06:49.656 --> 06:53.111
<i>Do I have to kill someone else
to get your attention?</i>

06:53.112 --> 06:58.576
<i>Please... Don't make me do
something we will all regret.</i>

07:03.299 --> 07:05.043
<i>So, he's carrying me upstairs</i>

07:05.044 --> 07:08.756
<i>on his back, and I can feel his
muscles keeping me from falling</i>

07:08.757 --> 07:10.873
into this hundred-foot ravine.

07:11.945 --> 07:13.241
Oh, Lindy!

07:13.242 --> 07:14.761
Look who's here.

07:15.754 --> 07:16.926
Tessa.

07:16.927 --> 07:19.941
- Oh, my God, Lindy!
- Hi.

07:20.542 --> 07:22.709
It's amazing to meet you
finally.

07:22.710 --> 07:24.622
- Such a surprise.
- Just off the plane.

07:24.623 --> 07:26.934
You must try a <i> caipirinha.</i>
Go on.

07:26.935 --> 07:29.190
It's the Brazilian national
drink.

07:29.191 --> 07:32.093
Nectar of the gods.
Trust me.

07:32.094 --> 07:34.975
- These people know how to live.
- Thanks.

07:34.976 --> 07:37.111
I learned how to make these
at a bar in Ipanema.

07:37.112 --> 07:39.920
Be warned.
Too many and you'll definitely

07:39.921 --> 07:42.991
crave a party somewhere.
Everywhere.

07:42.992 --> 07:44.877
So that's where you've been...
Brazil.

07:44.878 --> 07:47.653
- One of the places.
- Hence the communication blackout.

07:47.654 --> 07:50.411
I woke up on my 22nd birthday

07:50.412 --> 07:52.460
and I realized,
I'd only been to two out of the

07:52.461 --> 07:54.926
seven continents, so I left.

07:54.927 --> 07:57.967
I wanted to go where no one gets
to go,

07:57.968 --> 07:59.831
see the things they never get to see.

07:59.832 --> 08:02.607
I can't believe you've become
such an adventurer.

08:02.608 --> 08:04.449
Never thought you'd see the
day, right?

08:04.450 --> 08:07.455
Honestly, no.
When we were in boarding school,

08:07.456 --> 08:10.102
she was so afraid of flying that
she wouldn't even go back home

08:10.103 --> 08:12.671
to England to see her family for
the holidays.

08:12.672 --> 08:16.231
I conquered my fear and now
I'm conquering all my fears.

08:16.232 --> 08:17.456
How long are you staying
the city?

08:17.457 --> 08:23.379
I have no idea. I guess I'm
just taking it one day at a time.

08:25.939 --> 08:27.627
So you're okay with it?
With her staying?

08:27.628 --> 08:29.907
- Of course.
- But you need to tell her.

08:29.908 --> 08:32.275
What?
Oh.

08:32.275 --> 08:34.458
That we're rationed only six
minutes in the shower,

08:34.460 --> 08:35.875
as our hot water tank sucks?

08:35.876 --> 08:36.836
Stop it.

08:36.837 --> 08:38.515
If she's going to stay, she
needs to know.

08:38.517 --> 08:40.082
I have not seen Tessa in so
long.

08:40.083 --> 08:42.267
I just want to spend time with
her.

08:42.268 --> 08:45.892
I mean, I have to ease her into
the whole crazy time thing.

08:45.893 --> 08:48.506
You mean crazy in the whole
serial killer sense of the word?

08:49.207 --> 08:50.194
Yes.

08:50.795 --> 08:53.380
If she stays, you tell her
everything.

08:55.599 --> 08:56.679
Fine.

08:56.680 --> 08:58.871
(Knocking)

09:01.399 --> 09:02.664
Hi.

09:02.665 --> 09:04.240
Well, hello.

09:04.241 --> 09:05.816
Let me guess.
You're here for Lindy?

09:05.817 --> 09:07.416
Eh, that's negotiable.

09:07.417 --> 09:09.791
- I'm Tessa.
- I'm, uh...

09:10.592 --> 09:11.915
<i>Impressa.</i>

09:11.916 --> 09:13.239
(Both laugh)

09:13.640 --> 09:15.543
- We should go out.
- George.

09:15.544 --> 09:18.639
That's four of us.
Four definitely makes a party.

09:18.640 --> 09:19.864
Yes, it does.

09:21.320 --> 09:22.496
Lindy?

09:22.497 --> 09:25.587
- Yes, Lindy.
- Yeah, sorry.

09:25.588 --> 09:27.684
George and I have some work that
we really need to catch up on.

09:27.685 --> 09:29.260
- Do we?
- Next time.

09:29.261 --> 09:32.178
Next time, yeah.
Okay.

09:32.179 --> 09:34.171
(Typing on keyboard)

09:34.172 --> 09:36.139
Everything on Virtual Slumber
is done electronically.

09:36.140 --> 09:39.651
People fill out a profile online,
rent an apartment,

09:39.652 --> 09:42.699
it gets sent a QR key that opens a
digital lock.

09:42.700 --> 09:44.163
What about the owner of the
apartment?

09:45.147 --> 09:46.587
Lives in Paris full time.

09:46.588 --> 09:50.428
Okay, first off, the whole
concept is disgusting, okay?

09:50.429 --> 09:52.611
Renting someone else's apartment
with all their things and

09:52.612 --> 09:55.975
sleeping in their bed?
People sweat a liter of water

09:55.976 --> 10:00.512
into their mattress every night.
That's practically a waterbed.

10:01.622 --> 10:04.223
Okay.
Uh, it looks like this apartment

10:04.224 --> 10:09.256
isn't available until tomorrow.
Booking now.

10:09.257 --> 10:10.429
(Computer beeps)

10:10.430 --> 10:11.845
So...

10:11.846 --> 10:14.869
I know you got this case from
Jake, but what you're not

10:14.870 --> 10:17.774
telling me is, what's going on
with you guys?

10:19.205 --> 10:22.341
I don't know.
It's confusing.

10:22.342 --> 10:24.420
Why?
'Cause you like him?

10:25.421 --> 10:29.782
Oh... I'm so not helping you
until you admit you like him.

10:32.013 --> 10:33.257
I like him.

10:33.258 --> 10:34.257
Maybe.

10:34.258 --> 10:35.080
What?

10:35.081 --> 10:36.801
Maybe?
Come on.

10:36.802 --> 10:39.289
That wasn't that hard, was it?
Move.

10:40.090 --> 10:43.666
Jeez.
Okay.

10:43.667 --> 10:45.128
Let's see.

10:47.193 --> 10:48.944
(Computer beeps)

10:48.945 --> 10:50.170
Huh.

10:50.171 --> 10:54.242
That's weird. The apartment
network is protected.

10:55.343 --> 10:56.354
(Computer beeps)

10:57.553 --> 10:59.121
Really protected.

10:59.122 --> 11:00.653
So how do we get a closer look?

11:02.957 --> 11:04.693
Both: Fibertap.

11:05.094 --> 11:07.679
(Dialing) (Line ringing)

11:07.680 --> 11:08.548
<i>Hello?</i>

11:08.549 --> 11:09.418
Uh, delivery.

11:09.419 --> 11:12.073
I've got flowers for you.
Uh, lovely flowers, actually.

11:12.074 --> 11:14.113
From your grandmother?

11:14.114 --> 11:15.737
- (Buzzer)
- Yes!

11:15.738 --> 11:17.273
You're a bad person.

11:18.545 --> 11:22.401
(Typing on keyboard)

11:24.502 --> 11:28.032
Huh. Nobody used the elevator
entrance to that apartment that night

11:28.033 --> 11:29.537
besides Nick and Beth.

11:29.538 --> 11:32.369
So, whoever broke in entered
another way.

11:32.370 --> 11:34.258
It's eight stories up.
There's no fire escape.

11:36.338 --> 11:42.589
So, on a scale of one to "ton,"
how good was the Jake kiss?

11:42.590 --> 11:44.573
I am not grading kisses
with you.

11:44.574 --> 11:47.126
Oh, come on. I am out here
in my spare time, Linds.

11:47.127 --> 11:48.974
Okay, surprise factor, a ten.

11:48.975 --> 11:52.597
- The rest, none of your business.
- "None of your business."

11:52.598 --> 11:53.894
(Laughing)

11:54.495 --> 11:56.436
Hello, hold on.

11:56.437 --> 11:59.637
I'm seeing a ton of video
compression traffic,

11:59.638 --> 12:02.829
like they're running a live cable
station out of the apartment.

12:02.830 --> 12:04.869
That means that apartment is
filled with hidden cameras.

12:04.870 --> 12:07.506
Okay, yep. That's pretty
much my worst nightmare.

12:07.507 --> 12:09.321
So, where is all that footage
going?

12:13.665 --> 12:16.345
All the data's being transmitted
from the apartment through TOR,

12:16.346 --> 12:18.986
uploading to an untraceable
website.

12:18.987 --> 12:22.600
As in the 99% of the Internet
that's hidden from the normals.

12:22.601 --> 12:26.033
A haven for the weird and
illegal.

12:26.034 --> 12:27.970
- We know.
- I just like saying that phrase...

12:27.971 --> 12:32.329
<i>A haven for the weird and
gross and the illegal.</i>

12:32.330 --> 12:33.573
I've got a lock.

12:36.941 --> 12:38.246
"Dolls house"?

12:39.702 --> 12:43.205
(Overlapping chatter)

12:43.206 --> 12:46.773
- What the hell is that?
- It's a voyeur website.

12:46.774 --> 12:48.589
They're all being watched.

12:48.590 --> 12:50.901
(Overlapping chatter)

12:50.902 --> 12:52.949
This is happening all over the
city.

12:52.950 --> 12:56.183
(Overlapping chatter)

13:03.707 --> 13:06.084
(Overlapping chatter)

13:06.085 --> 13:07.076
You know, I've heard nothing

13:07.077 --> 13:08.815
from Oliver since that night?
Not one word.

13:08.816 --> 13:11.328
Totally blew me off.
Can you blame him?

13:11.329 --> 13:13.448
I thought he was, you know,
into it.

13:13.449 --> 13:15.559
Okay, your first date was
with a serial killer,

13:15.560 --> 13:18.888
your next date was with a
sociopath cyber terrorist.

13:18.889 --> 13:20.143
Honey, I think he had his fill.

13:22.294 --> 13:23.615
Connor, this is Tessa.

13:24.216 --> 13:27.192
- Why are all the hot men gay?
- (Laughing)

13:28.455 --> 13:29.888
You look different from your
pictures.

13:29.889 --> 13:32.056
Oh, God.
I was so clueless back then.

13:32.057 --> 13:33.191
I liked how you were.

13:33.192 --> 13:35.751
No, let's burn all those pictures
and let's make new pictures.

13:36.152 --> 13:37.313
Shots!

13:40.914 --> 13:42.543
(Overlapping chatter)

13:42.544 --> 13:43.428
We can't shut it down...

13:43.429 --> 13:46.506
There's nowhere to track it.
It's so deep, its url is masked

13:46.507 --> 13:48.067
by several bulletproof
countries.

13:48.068 --> 13:49.187
So, what do we do?

13:49.188 --> 13:51.771
There are over 1,000 apartments
on Virtual Slumber in New York.

13:51.772 --> 13:53.707
We have no way of knowing which
ones have cameras.

13:53.708 --> 13:55.803
You need to get this couple
to come in now so we can get a

13:55.804 --> 13:57.060
warrant and search that
apartment.

13:57.061 --> 13:57.860
I tried.

13:57.861 --> 13:59.540
They came to me because they
don't want the police involved.

13:59.541 --> 14:01.763
Well, it's not about just
them anymore, is it?

14:01.764 --> 14:03.171
We're involved.

14:03.172 --> 14:04.252
Okay, let me get this straight.

14:04.253 --> 14:06.051
This guy and his girlfriend
get drugged

14:06.052 --> 14:07.610
and he finds whip marks
on his back,

14:07.611 --> 14:10.240
but he won't let the cops help him?

14:10.241 --> 14:11.372
He's hiding something.

14:11.373 --> 14:13.128
- (Computer alert)
- Uh, guys?

14:13.129 --> 14:15.127
I just found a load of archives
on the site.

14:15.528 --> 14:17.215
Backlogs of all the hidden
camera footage.

14:17.216 --> 14:19.439
Great. So, we can find the footage
of Nick and Beth from that night.

14:19.440 --> 14:21.080
That's a lot of files.

14:22.408 --> 14:24.927
Well, I guess we're ordering
Chinese, Tommy boy.

14:26.663 --> 14:29.288
What?
No. A serial killer?

14:29.889 --> 14:31.760
- You're serious?
- She's serious.

14:31.761 --> 14:32.840
Drink.

14:38.147 --> 14:40.987
That's better.
Tell me everything.

14:40.988 --> 14:45.402
I mean, that's all, really.
There's a serial killer stalking

14:45.403 --> 14:48.155
people and ending their lives.

14:48.156 --> 14:49.920
Drink.

14:53.735 --> 14:58.112
I'm so sorry. I mean, that
is really, really intense.

14:58.113 --> 15:00.391
Yeah, it's, um, a lot to
process.

15:00.392 --> 15:01.340
So, hey, if you don't want to

15:01.341 --> 15:02.752
- stay with them...
- Please.

15:02.753 --> 15:04.316
I lived in the rainforest for
four months,

15:04.317 --> 15:06.268
a place where
everything wants to kill you.

15:06.269 --> 15:07.563
The rainforest?
I'd like to go there.

15:07.564 --> 15:08.723
You better hurry.

15:08.724 --> 15:10.172
- Why?
- It's bad.

15:10.173 --> 15:13.555
The world's dying, Connor.
Faster than we know.

15:16.379 --> 15:19.547
More drinks.
Be right back.

15:19.548 --> 15:21.940
I need to show that bartender
how to make a cocktail.

15:24.435 --> 15:26.827
Okay, there's definitely
something different about her

15:26.828 --> 15:29.651
- that now I'm worried.
- What do you mean?

15:29.652 --> 15:31.636
Tessa.
She never liked to drink.

15:31.637 --> 15:34.360
Now she's some shot-loving world
traveler.

15:34.361 --> 15:35.820
I don't know.
Would you want to be judged

15:35.821 --> 15:38.315
based on who you were in high
school? I wouldn't.

15:38.616 --> 15:39.638
What are you saying?

15:39.707 --> 15:41.101
People change.

15:41.102 --> 15:42.861
I don't know if they change
that much.

15:42.862 --> 15:44.621
Bottoms up.
Cheers.

That's not what I was expecting.

16:08.358 --> 16:09.413
Nick's been renting the same

16:09.414 --> 16:12.422
apartment on Virtual Slumber and
using it to cheat on Beth.

16:12.423 --> 16:15.293
Definitely a player.
Sure looks like a motive to me.

16:15.294 --> 16:17.934
Guys, I found the footage for
Beth and Nick that night.

16:18.155 --> 16:19.042
All I'm getting is this.

16:19.043 --> 16:20.337
<i>(Giggling)</i>

16:20.703 --> 16:23.841
<i>You don't get to play here.
(Giggling)</i>

16:23.842 --> 16:26.169
<i>You don't get to play.
(Laughing)</i>

16:26.170 --> 16:27.321
What the hell is that?

16:27.922 --> 16:29.242
We need to talk to Beth.

16:38.122 --> 16:39.522
HE CHEATED ON ME, TOO.

16:43.323 --> 16:44.731
(Typing on keyboard)

16:45.032 --> 16:45.985
WHO IS THIS?

16:49.257 --> 16:50.608
How did you get my user name?

16:52.183 --> 16:53.891
I found it on his computer.

16:53.892 --> 16:55.126
Nick?

16:56.539 --> 16:58.124
So, you're one of them.

16:58.125 --> 16:59.051
Them?

16:59.052 --> 17:00.580
One of his flings.

17:01.508 --> 17:02.884
Oh.

17:02.885 --> 17:04.382
You thought it was just us two?

17:05.034 --> 17:07.084
There are other girls, you know.

17:07.085 --> 17:10.277
Lots of them.
He's a liar.

17:10.978 --> 17:12.388
An addict.

17:13.589 --> 17:14.737
I'm sorry.

17:15.238 --> 17:18.676
I just came here to tell you that
I had no idea what he was doing.

17:18.678 --> 17:19.934
Why?

17:19.935 --> 17:22.589
To commiserate,
compare notes, gloat?

17:22.589 --> 17:25.597
- He lied to us.
- Do not lump us together.

17:25.598 --> 17:28.309
Nick and I met during freshmen
orientation.

17:28.631 --> 17:30.168
He was my first love.

17:31.424 --> 17:34.639
Who are you but a distraction,

17:34.640 --> 17:36.528
a temptation?

17:38.888 --> 17:40.736
I'm just so angry.

17:41.880 --> 17:44.927
So humiliated.
Don't you just wish that there

17:44.928 --> 17:46.704
was a way to get back at him?

17:46.705 --> 17:49.328
I'm sorry for you.

17:49.329 --> 17:51.096
I am.

17:52.080 --> 17:54.064
But I got my revenge.

17:54.665 --> 17:59.035
Now leave me alone.
("Alone" echoing)

17:59.636 --> 18:00.588
So?

18:00.589 --> 18:01.484
It worked.

18:01.485 --> 18:03.404
While you lured her to the
watering hole,

18:03.405 --> 18:07.308
you mischievous Lynx,
I compromised her computer.

18:07.309 --> 18:08.132
And?

18:08.133 --> 18:09.188
Found a video file that was

18:09.189 --> 18:13.132
uploaded the night after Nick and Beth's
little Virtual Slumber encounter.

18:13.133 --> 18:14.960
Take a look.

18:32.977 --> 18:34.052
(Whip cracking)

18:34.053 --> 18:36.392
She wanted revenge
but needed an alibi...

18:36.393 --> 18:38.975
(Whip cracking)

18:39.872 --> 18:42.191
So she hired someone else to
do it.

18:42.192 --> 18:46.248
(Whip cracking)

18:49.648 --> 18:51.312
That is some weird creepiness.

18:51.313 --> 18:52.512
Who does that?

18:53.513 --> 18:56.805
Attached to Beth's video is a
hidden url for the dolls house site.

18:56.806 --> 18:58.652
Look.

18:58.653 --> 19:01.596
(Overlapping chatter)

19:01.597 --> 19:02.996
That's a whole other layer.

19:02.997 --> 19:05.116
For special guests.

19:18.196 --> 19:22.459
Apparently, just watching isn't
enough for some people.

19:22.460 --> 19:26.656
This site provides a service where
you can pay to have them played with.

19:26.657 --> 19:27.407
Terrifying.

19:27.408 --> 19:30.192
I'm never leaving my apartment,
ever, again.

19:30.793 --> 19:36.248
Okay. Grabbing Beth's user
name and password. And...

19:39.448 --> 19:41.639
Menu?
Wait, what's on the menu?

19:43.569 --> 19:46.136
These are all Virtual Slumber
profile pictures, but...

19:47.368 --> 19:50.024
That's how Beth did it.
When Nick went to the apartment

19:50.025 --> 19:53.632
on Virtual Slumber, his picture
went up on this menu.

19:59.507 --> 20:03.324
Lindy...
Someone bought you.

20:03.325 --> 20:04.216
How?

20:05.728 --> 20:08.344
It's because I rented the
apartment.

20:12.431 --> 20:13.832
A sting?
Absolutely not.

20:13.833 --> 20:15.188
I rented the apartment for
the night.

20:15.189 --> 20:16.739
Let's use it to lure him out.

20:16.740 --> 20:18.028
We have no idea what this guy

20:18.029 --> 20:20.828
wants to do with you or what
kind of perv paid him to do it.

20:20.829 --> 20:22.692
It might be our only chance
to actually catch whoever is

20:22.693 --> 20:24.340
doing this, in the flesh.

20:24.341 --> 20:25.956
I've obtained a warrant.

20:25.957 --> 20:27.819
We're covertly accessing the
admin portal.

20:27.820 --> 20:29.348
That'll tell us who runs dolls
house.

20:29.349 --> 20:30.468
Yeah? And how's that coming?

20:30.469 --> 20:32.371
Well, admin just keeps
displaying the same word...

20:32.372 --> 20:34.373
"Babylon"... it's untraceable.

20:34.374 --> 20:37.676
We have a chance here, a tiny
window through which this

20:37.677 --> 20:39.212
pervert is going to crawl.

20:40.444 --> 20:41.757
All right.

20:41.758 --> 20:45.327
But if we do this, you let me
plan everything.

20:45.328 --> 20:47.416
Everything.

20:52.456 --> 20:53.696
Lindy?

20:54.760 --> 20:56.008
Good, you're back.

20:56.009 --> 20:58.856
Why are you stuffing my
handbag with toiletries?

20:58.857 --> 21:00.576
You're leaving.

21:00.577 --> 21:01.881
Leaving?

21:01.882 --> 21:03.312
Cyber Crimes is working a big
case.

21:03.313 --> 21:05.303
I can't leave you here without a
protective detail.

21:05.304 --> 21:06.688
Where exactly am I leaving to?

21:06.689 --> 21:08.520
Montauk.
I booked you on the Jitney.

21:08.521 --> 21:09.728
Connor's meeting you there.

21:09.729 --> 21:12.224
Walkups are so exhausting.

21:13.664 --> 21:15.364
What's happening?

21:16.596 --> 21:18.300
Did you tell her about him?

21:18.301 --> 21:20.467
- Yes, I told her.
- She told me.

21:20.468 --> 21:24.045
So then you both understand why it's
not safe to be alone in this apartment.

21:24.046 --> 21:25.100
Why Montauk?

21:25.101 --> 21:27.541
It's the end of the season.
It'll be quiet and safe.

21:29.775 --> 21:33.672
Come on, Sophia.
We'll make it work.

21:33.673 --> 21:37.976
(Sighing) Okay, sure.

21:37.977 --> 21:39.399
But just the weekend.

21:39.400 --> 21:41.720
Thank you.

21:46.528 --> 21:47.967
I'm sorry, I had to go to the police.

21:47.968 --> 21:49.391
You did the right thing.

21:49.392 --> 21:51.664
But Nick doesn't want to press
any charges against Beth...

21:51.665 --> 21:53.912
He just wants the footage of him
off the Internet.

21:53.913 --> 21:55.559
We'll do our best.

21:56.460 --> 21:57.848
Do you really have to go
through with this?

21:57.849 --> 22:01.164
I brought you this case. If something
happens to you, it's my fault.

22:01.165 --> 22:03.076
I'm going to be fine.

22:03.077 --> 22:04.644
It has to be me.

22:05.984 --> 22:07.304
Hey.

22:12.312 --> 22:15.461
Promise me you'll be careful.

22:17.756 --> 22:21.180
From what we know, the whole apartment
is rigged with voyeur cameras, full audio.

22:21.181 --> 22:23.540
This creep will be watching
everything we do.

22:23.541 --> 22:25.564
Pascal, you'll lead a team of

22:25.565 --> 22:27.571
plainclothes unis outside the
apartment.

22:27.572 --> 22:28.292
Got it.

22:28.293 --> 22:30.396
Yeager, you'll go link
the voyeur site and be our eyes.

22:30.397 --> 22:33.220
You go inside the apartment and
