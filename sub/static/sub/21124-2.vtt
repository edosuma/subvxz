for the barnacle.

10:34.050 --> 10:35.301
That's a rabbit.

10:36.677 --> 10:37.720
Can I come in?

10:38.554 --> 10:44.185
[both singing] <i>♪ Hold me now</i>
<i>Oh, oh, warm my heart ♪</i>

10:44.769 --> 10:48.773
<i>♪ Stay with me, let loving start ♪</i>

10:48.856 --> 10:50.024
<i>♪ Let loving start ♪</i>

10:50.107 --> 10:51.484
One, two, three.

10:51.567 --> 10:53.152
<i>♪ Ah, ah, oh</i>
<i>Hold me now ♪</i>

10:53.235 --> 10:54.362
Some of us are trying to work.

10:54.945 --> 10:56.364
They're slow dancing.

10:56.447 --> 10:58.532
They just fully did a spin. [chuckles]

10:59.116 --> 10:59.950
Ow!

11:00.034 --> 11:01.535
[Reggie] That's not what we practiced.

11:01.661 --> 11:02.787
Oh, my gosh.

11:03.704 --> 11:04.664
All right, um...

11:05.956 --> 11:06.791
You.

11:08.459 --> 11:10.169
-And you.
-Oh.

11:10.252 --> 11:11.337
-[Cherry] Let's see what you got.
-[Melrose] Okay.

11:11.921 --> 11:14.215
Come on, drama nerd. Hold me now.

11:15.508 --> 11:16.342
Okay.

11:16.425 --> 11:17.968
I think it's like this.

11:18.094 --> 11:19.011
Now...

11:19.303 --> 11:23.140
And then I think I'm gonna spin around,

11:23.224 --> 11:25.351
and we're gonna put your arm
around my neck.

11:25.434 --> 11:26.268
Okay.

11:26.811 --> 11:28.145
Then here, like this,

11:28.687 --> 11:30.314
and then just sort of in like this.

11:30.398 --> 11:31.857
[girls laughing]

11:31.941 --> 11:33.109
Melanie, do the moves.

11:33.192 --> 11:35.194
Those are my moves, kid.

11:35.277 --> 11:39.865
I mean, they're the moves that got me cast
in the porn dance party in <i>Body Double.</i>

11:40.199 --> 11:42.785
Please, as if you worked with De Palma.

11:43.452 --> 11:44.537
I did. So...

11:45.287 --> 11:47.289
-[yells]
-Ow!

11:47.873 --> 11:49.875
-Strindberg, you okay?
-I'm fine. I'm fine.

11:52.420 --> 11:53.462
What the fuck was that?

11:53.546 --> 11:54.880
I took her by surprise.

11:55.172 --> 11:56.215
You know, to win.

11:56.632 --> 11:58.592
That's the whole point of the whole thing.

11:58.676 --> 12:00.386
The point is to do it safely.

12:00.469 --> 12:03.514
-You could've seriously hurt her.
-It's all part of the process.

12:03.597 --> 12:05.141
Ah. Delayed pain.

12:05.224 --> 12:06.434
[Cherry] I don't have time

12:06.517 --> 12:08.894
to deal with spoiled bitches
who don't take anything seriously.

12:08.978 --> 12:09.895
[scoffs]

12:10.604 --> 12:13.524
-You don't even know me.
-Oh, sweetie, I know you.

12:14.233 --> 12:16.902
You never had a real job,
your daddy pays all your bills,

12:16.986 --> 12:19.613
but you don't let anyone know
unless you're really drunk.

12:19.697 --> 12:23.742
You drive a limo because you want someone,
anyone, to think you're interesting.

12:25.536 --> 12:26.579
Tell me I'm wrong.

12:33.669 --> 12:36.297
You got this job
'cause you fucked the director.

12:39.091 --> 12:40.092
Oh, man.

12:46.474 --> 12:48.434
I got this job because I'm a pro,

12:49.310 --> 12:51.353
and I know
how to make these moves look real.

12:51.937 --> 12:54.607
You think that this shit looks real?

12:54.940 --> 12:58.110
Ever get in a street fight,
and you're like, "Careful for my neck.

12:58.194 --> 13:00.070
Just make sure to do it safely"?

13:00.154 --> 13:01.739
It's fucking fake.

13:01.822 --> 13:03.782
Okay. Come at me.

13:05.075 --> 13:06.494
Make it look as real as you want.

13:09.663 --> 13:10.498
Okay.

13:11.081 --> 13:12.208
Oh, my God!

13:22.384 --> 13:24.345
[moans]

13:26.096 --> 13:27.515
Hyah, hyah, hyah!

13:29.558 --> 13:31.602
Cherry... Cherry-- [mutters]

13:39.193 --> 13:40.236
That's lunch.

13:43.697 --> 13:45.157
-Nice place.
-Yeah?

13:46.367 --> 13:48.035
Once we get divorced, wanna buy it?

13:48.118 --> 13:50.788
It has a new trash compactor,
just installed.

13:50.871 --> 13:53.541
-So, you're gonna leave him?
-Why, you wanna have sex with him, too?

13:55.668 --> 13:57.586
I have no idea what I'm going to do.

13:58.420 --> 14:00.756
My wife cheated on me
with my Steadicam operator.

14:00.839 --> 14:01.715
Not my best friend,

14:01.799 --> 14:04.343
but technically I was paying him
to fuck my wife.

14:04.426 --> 14:06.345
So, the next day I walked out.

14:06.929 --> 14:09.598
I quit the marriage. I quit the movie.
I even left my dog.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.058
Got on a plane for Vegas,

14:11.141 --> 14:14.478
two weeks later, I woke up,
felt a lot better about myself.

14:14.853 --> 14:17.940
Thank you, that's great advice.
I'll just, uh...

14:18.023 --> 14:21.777
leave my baby on a stranger's doorstep
and get blackout drunk.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.028
Why are you here?

14:23.112 --> 14:25.739
Did I break something on your set?

14:25.823 --> 14:28.576
Debbie,
I've been casting this thing for weeks.

14:28.659 --> 14:31.787
I mean, just raking the gutter
because who gives a shit?

14:32.454 --> 14:34.206
-Yeah.
-Then you come outta nowhere,

14:34.290 --> 14:38.210
just burst in
like some Greek goddess of rage,

14:38.294 --> 14:40.337
and I saw it. I saw it, Debbie.

14:40.421 --> 14:42.756
Like a vision before a seizure.

14:42.840 --> 14:43.883
The whole show.

14:44.216 --> 14:46.927
And you,
you were in the middle of the ring.

14:47.970 --> 14:49.930
You want me to wrestle?

14:50.014 --> 14:51.265
I want you to be my lead.

14:51.348 --> 14:53.976
I've got girls who can do the splits,
they can cut hair,

14:54.059 --> 14:55.561
but I don't have a star.

14:55.644 --> 14:56.896
I need a star.

14:58.689 --> 14:59.857
Excuse me.

14:59.940 --> 15:02.818
Okay, I'm--
I'm sorry, I can't handle this,

15:02.902 --> 15:05.070
and I'm not acting anymore.

15:05.154 --> 15:06.864
Bullshit! You know what I think?

15:07.406 --> 15:09.575
You're pretty. You got big boobs,

15:09.658 --> 15:12.161
and those soap writers didn't count
on you having brains.

15:12.244 --> 15:13.078
Am I right?

15:13.162 --> 15:16.707
You asked too many questions,
you maybe improvised a few too many lines,

15:16.790 --> 15:18.876
and then, boom, Sleeping Beauty.

15:20.878 --> 15:24.548
Yeah, if you wanna do something more
than nod and eat a salad,

15:24.632 --> 15:28.052
and make a pretty cry-face,
you are punished.

15:28.135 --> 15:29.929
I don't wanna punish you, Debbie.

15:30.220 --> 15:31.680
I want that cavewoman anger.

15:31.764 --> 15:34.934
I want those crazy faces of agony.

15:35.017 --> 15:38.395
I mean...
you're like Grace Kelly on steroids.

15:38.479 --> 15:42.399
And I wanna put that on television
every single week, Debbie.

15:42.483 --> 15:45.694
You're just saying that
to get me to join your circus.

15:45.778 --> 15:48.572
Yes, true. But I mean it.

15:48.656 --> 15:51.575
Fuck salads.
Fuck tiny moments in close-up.

15:52.159 --> 15:53.619
Fuck polite and comatose.

15:56.038 --> 15:58.832
Is there a script, or--
[scoffs] I don't know why I'm asking.

15:58.916 --> 16:02.670
-What the fuck am I doing?
-Just come down, check it out for an hour.

16:02.753 --> 16:04.964
You don't have to say anything,
do anything.

16:05.047 --> 16:07.466
If you don't wanna be part of it,
I'll drive you home.

16:07.549 --> 16:09.301
Door to door, like a perfect gentleman.

16:13.597 --> 16:14.431
What about Ruth?

16:15.015 --> 16:16.392
Who? Her? Oh.

16:16.475 --> 16:18.852
Fuck her.
I cut her the first day of callbacks.

16:20.354 --> 16:22.314
-[Ruth] Can we get four burgers,
-[Melrose] One with cheese.

16:22.398 --> 16:23.649
-four fries...
-[Melrose] Five.

16:23.732 --> 16:25.693
extra ketchup and mustard on the side

16:25.776 --> 16:30.739
and two Diet Pepsis and one Pepsi regular,
and that's it.

16:31.240 --> 16:32.616
Ooh. And a milkshake!

16:32.700 --> 16:35.744
Oh, and get this girl a milkshake. On me.

16:35.828 --> 16:38.622
-Thanks.
-We're in training, so we have to bulk up.

16:39.206 --> 16:40.499
-Twenty even.
-[mutters]

16:43.168 --> 16:44.878
I think I have some change.

16:53.345 --> 16:54.179
Thanks.

16:57.599 --> 16:58.475
Um...

16:59.268 --> 17:02.396
-I don't think you're allowed to do that.
-Well, I need to chill the fuck out

17:02.479 --> 17:05.149
'cause some crazy stunt-cunt
just tried to murder me.

17:05.733 --> 17:08.235
-That was a sleeper hold.
-That was a lawsuit.

17:09.403 --> 17:11.113
Who does that bitch think she is?

17:11.196 --> 17:13.407
This morning,
she was just another schmucky actress

17:13.490 --> 17:14.366
in a Kmart leotard,

17:14.450 --> 17:17.119
and now she's going around
knocking people unconscious?

17:18.203 --> 17:20.289
Who died
and made her the black Nurse Ratched?

17:20.873 --> 17:21.915
The director did.

17:21.999 --> 17:23.625
He said, "She's in charge."

17:23.709 --> 17:25.627
The point is I could've died.

17:25.711 --> 17:27.171
Maybe you did die. [chuckles]

17:27.588 --> 17:30.716
Maybe we're all dead
and this is the afterlife.

17:31.300 --> 17:32.468
Are you already high?

17:32.551 --> 17:33.469
No.

17:33.969 --> 17:36.513
No one passed it to me,
and I've been waiting because I'm polite.

17:37.014 --> 17:37.848
Oh.

17:38.974 --> 17:41.727
-Thanks.
-I think Cherry's doing the best she can.

17:42.269 --> 17:44.271
Oh, yeah? You big into dictators?

17:45.022 --> 17:47.941
I don't know how things work
in the music video world,

17:48.817 --> 17:51.236
but at least she's trying
to make us an ensemble.

17:51.320 --> 17:54.448
Usually in this industry,
it's every man for himself,

17:54.531 --> 17:56.700
and it's almost always a man,

17:56.784 --> 18:00.245
telling you your ass is too fat
at the same time he's trying to grope it.

18:00.329 --> 18:04.833
And having a woman in charge instead
of that Sackballs guy?

18:05.125 --> 18:08.128
[scoffs] This is as good as it gets.

18:09.797 --> 18:10.881
If you're into the sisterhood,

18:10.964 --> 18:12.758
maybe you shouldn't have fucked
your friend's husband.

18:16.512 --> 18:17.513
-I didn't.
-Dude...

18:18.263 --> 18:21.308
I am the Cézanne of bullshit artists.

18:22.059 --> 18:25.020
-[man] Number 18.
-Oh, that's us. [clears throat]

18:25.521 --> 18:27.523
Oh, you owe me 20 bucks.

18:30.776 --> 18:31.860
Thank you.

18:39.409 --> 18:41.912
Okay, ladies, back to the Isle of Lesbos!

18:42.913 --> 18:44.790
[grunting]

18:44.873 --> 18:46.333
[Cherry] Guys, this looks awesome.

18:46.917 --> 18:48.252
You're getting it. Great.

18:48.836 --> 18:50.462
Let's move to actual back bumps.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.297
Yeah? Let's go.

18:54.550 --> 18:56.969
All right.
So, it goes a little something like this.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.849
It's like a belly flop, but on your back.

19:02.432 --> 19:05.102
Let's give it a shot. Carmen, kick us off.

19:05.185 --> 19:07.813
-[Jenny] Yeah. Get it, girl.
-[Dawn] Come on, Carmen!

19:10.149 --> 19:11.400
[cheering and applause]

19:11.483 --> 19:13.485
-Yes.
-She can do it, I can do it.

19:13.569 --> 19:15.529
I like it. All right, who's next?

19:17.281 --> 19:18.448
[Melrose] Know what, I'll try.

19:21.493 --> 19:23.537
-All right.
-Okay.

19:27.207 --> 19:28.375
[Melrose clears throat]

19:32.671 --> 19:35.757
Shit, that was a disaster.
Let me try again, I can do better.

19:36.550 --> 19:37.384
Okay.

19:40.929 --> 19:44.349
Crap, I can do it better.
Can I go one more time?

19:44.433 --> 19:45.851
-You're fine.
-I wanna push myself.

19:45.934 --> 19:46.935
I wanna work harder.

19:50.480 --> 19:51.481
Okay.

19:58.739 --> 20:00.991
[grunts] Oh, my fuck! No!

20:01.074 --> 20:02.951
-[groans] Oh, fuck!
-Oh...

20:03.535 --> 20:04.828
Oh... [exclaims]

20:04.912 --> 20:07.456
Oh, my God! What is happening?

20:08.040 --> 20:09.416
I thought I might be pregnant.

20:09.499 --> 20:11.960
I put my body through
too much trauma today.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.670
-This is so painful.
-Okay.

20:13.754 --> 20:15.672
-Am I having a miscarriage?
-All right...

20:15.756 --> 20:17.716
-[Arthie] Okay, I'm pre-med.
-[Melrose] Fuck, no.

20:17.799 --> 20:21.053
Are you cramping? Are you experiencing
any other symptoms of pain?

20:22.054 --> 20:23.764
Oh, fuck.

20:24.014 --> 20:25.098
Eh.

20:25.849 --> 20:26.892
[exhales]

20:28.977 --> 20:30.395
Bummer.

20:31.063 --> 20:33.148
How am I gonna tell Adam Ant

20:33.232 --> 20:36.944
that our precious little baby turned out
to be a womb goof?

20:38.153 --> 20:39.863
-[Arthie] What?
-Get out of my ring.

20:39.947 --> 20:41.365
De-fucking-lighted.

20:52.334 --> 20:55.045
[Sam] Ladies,
get out your autograph books.

20:55.128 --> 20:57.297
I want you to meet the new star of GLOW,

20:57.381 --> 20:59.925
-this is TV's own Debbie Morgan.
-Eagan.

21:00.008 --> 21:02.469
-Debbie Eagan.
-Where the hell have you been?

21:02.552 --> 21:03.720
Working my ass off.

21:03.804 --> 21:06.515
I drove to fucking Pasadena
in the middle of the day.

21:07.015 --> 21:08.016
Are you insane?

21:08.100 --> 21:11.061
Am I on fucking <i>Candid Camera?</i>
Why is she still here?

21:11.144 --> 21:13.480
-Oh, her. Yeah. I do-- Look--
-While you been gone

21:13.563 --> 21:15.148
-we done a lot of fuckin' around.
-Take me home.

21:15.232 --> 21:16.358
Give me your fucking keys.

21:16.441 --> 21:18.193
-I'm taking your car.
-Just a second.

21:18.277 --> 21:20.112
We got miscarriage bullshit
to show you.

21:20.946 --> 21:22.614
-What?
-Now I have your attention?

21:22.698 --> 21:25.284
You, just stop talking.
Just give me a minute. Okay?

21:25.367 --> 21:26.535
Just give me a minute.

21:26.618 --> 21:30.163
Honey. Honey, come with me. Come on.
It's gonna be all right.

21:31.415 --> 21:33.083
Don't stand up straight.

21:33.500 --> 21:35.335
-I'm--
-You have to be submissive.

21:35.419 --> 21:37.129
She's the Alpha and you're the Omega.

21:37.754 --> 21:39.423
-I'm--
-[Sheila] You're gonna provoke her.

21:40.048 --> 21:42.134
-Let me just--
-Slouch toward the ground.

21:42.509 --> 21:44.803
Now, slouch. [whispers] Submit.

21:44.886 --> 21:46.596
-[Debbie] What's the plan?
-[Sam] Sit down...

21:46.680 --> 21:47.556
She might kill you.

21:47.639 --> 21:49.558
[Sam] ...smooth it all out.
It's gonna be fun.

21:50.767 --> 21:52.394
[sighs] What are you doing?

21:52.477 --> 21:55.105
-She's submitting.
-No, don't even talk to me.

21:57.607 --> 21:59.067
Look down. Get low.

21:59.151 --> 22:03.238
-Put your muzzle to the ground.
-Okay, can-- Can everyone just be nice?

22:03.322 --> 22:05.532
All right? Let's just be nice.

22:06.241 --> 22:07.576
-Okay, here you go.
-Hi.

22:08.869 --> 22:09.745
Okay.

22:09.828 --> 22:11.955
-No, what is that?
-Okay, okay.

22:12.039 --> 22:13.540
I know, I know, I lied.

22:13.623 --> 22:16.376
It's not about the lie,
it's about where the lie takes you.

22:17.002 --> 22:19.629
Follow? So, just let me put this fire out.

22:19.713 --> 22:21.423
Fifteen minutes, Confucius.

22:21.923 --> 22:23.425
And only because it's rush hour.

22:26.011 --> 22:28.430
It'll still be rush hour in 15 minutes.

22:29.139 --> 22:30.140
Hi.

22:32.225 --> 22:33.101
[Sam grunts]

22:34.728 --> 22:36.813
So, what is this miscarriage bullshit?

22:37.606 --> 22:38.732
Why don't you show him?

22:38.815 --> 22:41.151
Oh, no, it was more of a one-time thing.

22:41.234 --> 22:42.736
You like attention so much,

22:42.819 --> 22:44.321
come on, show him.

22:46.239 --> 22:47.574
[groans] Fuck.

22:49.242 --> 22:52.120
And then I said, "Oh, God, the baby!"

22:52.204 --> 22:54.122
You know, "What's happening to the baby?"

22:54.206 --> 22:58.001
And then I, you know,
squirted ketchup out of my vagina.

23:00.921 --> 23:01.880
That was terrible.

23:02.964 --> 23:05.258
I didn't buy a single second of that.

23:06.176 --> 23:09.304
But, let's not throw out the baby
with the bathwater.

23:10.013 --> 23:12.682
Oh, sorry, maybe it's a wrong metaphor.

23:13.391 --> 23:14.476
Sorry.

23:14.726 --> 23:17.938
I think there's something here.
I know you were just being an asshole,

23:18.021 --> 23:19.981
but if this were a real scene
there'd be context,

23:20.065 --> 23:24.111
there'd be circumstances,
there'd be characters, right? Legacy?

23:25.278 --> 23:27.364
-Um...
-All right, let's get inside this thing.

23:27.447 --> 23:28.448
What happened?

23:28.990 --> 23:31.368
The miscarriage, was it an accident?

23:31.451 --> 23:33.745
Was it bad sushi?

23:33.829 --> 23:36.873
She was kicked in the stomach
by her Guatemalan swim coach

23:36.957 --> 23:40.001
who was jealous she lost her virginity
to the captain of the diving team.

23:40.585 --> 23:41.419
Wow.

23:42.504 --> 23:43.922
Good. Good.

23:44.005 --> 23:45.799
Kick in the stomach, I like that.

23:45.882 --> 23:47.968
Swim coach, I don't know.
We can lose him.

23:48.468 --> 23:49.761
We need a better assailant.

23:49.845 --> 23:53.306
What animal would kick a pregnant woman
in the belly?

23:53.890 --> 23:56.059
What kind of person would ruin the life

23:56.852 --> 24:00.105
of a gorgeous, successful, pregnant woman?

24:01.106 --> 24:03.275
What kind of homewrecker would do that?

24:05.610 --> 24:06.570
Ruth!

24:08.113 --> 24:10.323
Doesn't seem like
too much of a stretch for you.

24:11.032 --> 24:12.534
Come in the ring, join us.

24:14.411 --> 24:17.289
I want to,
but I'm really not feeling well.

24:17.831 --> 24:19.207
Gene Kelly had the flu

24:19.291 --> 24:21.710
when he did the title number
of <i>Singin' in the Rain.</i>

24:22.419 --> 24:23.962
It's true, he did.

24:28.383 --> 24:30.260
Look at this asshole.

24:31.386 --> 24:33.889
She doesn't care about anyone but herself.

24:34.890 --> 24:36.850
She's gonna destroy lives.

24:36.933 --> 24:39.936
Even tiny lives that haven't started yet.

24:40.478 --> 24:43.190
You're a horrible person
and you don't deserve to live.

24:43.773 --> 24:45.233
I think I deserve to live.

24:45.317 --> 24:46.526
Hey, Uta Hagen.

24:46.610 --> 24:49.154
Just take some fucking direction
for a minute.

24:49.237 --> 24:50.614
Is that too much to ask?

24:51.198 --> 24:53.450
It's not about you.
I'm trying to see if the skit works.

24:53.533 --> 24:55.035
Now circle the other one.

24:56.536 --> 24:57.454
Go.

24:58.038 --> 24:59.581
Okay, good.

25:03.043 --> 25:05.587
Okay, shit-stirrer,
let's work on your side.

25:05.670 --> 25:08.256
If there's one thing I learned
in my illustrious career,

25:08.340 --> 25:11.635
is that you can't rely on a blood rig
to sell a performance.

25:11.718 --> 25:12.761
Who are you?

25:12.844 --> 25:16.097
What kind of woman were you
before you lost everything?

25:16.681 --> 25:18.475
-I feel like I was--
-Wait, I got it.

25:18.558 --> 25:21.436
You're smart. You're ambitious...

25:23.355 --> 25:24.731
-Talented.
-[giggles]

25:24.814 --> 25:28.151
But nobody sees that.
All they see is the blonde knockout.

25:28.235 --> 25:29.819
-I'm not blond.
-Shut the fuck up.

25:29.903 --> 25:31.029
Okay.

25:31.112 --> 25:33.198
-He's talking about me.
-They're talking about her.

25:33.281 --> 25:36.660
-[Stacey] That makes sense.
-[Sam] Now, here you are, you're ripe.

25:37.661 --> 25:38.995
Fecund.

25:39.079 --> 25:40.830
A custodian of new life.

25:41.581 --> 25:44.709
You're a fertile harvest goddess.

25:45.460 --> 25:46.586
Now...

25:46.920 --> 25:48.713
pull your shoulders back,

25:48.797 --> 25:51.258
and strut like you own the ring.

25:53.510 --> 25:54.344
What is that?

25:54.427 --> 25:56.888
-Oh, I added--
-I said strut. Like you own the ring.

25:56.972 --> 25:59.224
-[Melrose] Yeah, but--
-[Sam] No. That's like a saunter.

25:59.307 --> 26:02.727
All right. Okay, now stick your belly out
a little bit, you're pregnant.

26:03.311 --> 26:04.729
Everything is fine.

26:04.813 --> 26:06.273
Everything is ideal.

26:06.940 --> 26:07.899
Until...

26:09.317 --> 26:11.444
the homewrecker arrives.

26:11.528 --> 26:12.862
She has nothing.

26:12.946 --> 26:13.905
No man,

26:14.572 --> 26:15.782
no love,

26:16.116 --> 26:17.701
no friends.

26:18.451 --> 26:20.287
Her hair is brown,

26:20.370 --> 26:21.997
the color of shit.

26:23.498 --> 26:26.167
All right. Now, lunge and miss.

26:27.335 --> 26:29.212
Wake up, Ruth! Time to act.

26:29.296 --> 26:30.755
Lunge and miss.

26:32.924 --> 26:33.758
Yes.

26:33.842 --> 26:36.011
Great. Now it's time for the big move.

26:36.094 --> 26:38.972
You're gonna kick her in the stomach,
set off a miscarriage

26:39.055 --> 26:41.599
that will ruin not one life,
not two lives,

26:41.683 --> 26:44.019
but three lives in the process.

26:44.102 --> 26:46.938
Let's go!
Kick, it's like a punch with your leg.

26:47.647 --> 26:50.108
Can I do the lockup instead,
where I hug her?

26:50.191 --> 26:51.484
Oh, my God.

26:51.568 --> 26:53.403
No. Kick.

26:56.823 --> 26:59.659
[shouts, groans]

26:59.743 --> 27:01.953
Yeah. Give words to the pain.

27:02.037 --> 27:03.622
[Melrose] Oh, my God, it hurts!

27:03.705 --> 27:05.915
Fuck! Am I having a miscarriage?

27:05.999 --> 27:08.251
Ah! Oh, no! [groans]

27:08.335 --> 27:10.045
-Am I bleeding?
-Give me the ketchup.

27:10.128 --> 27:12.380
I feel like I'm bleeding!
Oh, someone help!

27:12.964 --> 27:16.593
Since we're not making <i>Apocalypse Now,</i>
let's add a little fun back in.

27:19.888 --> 27:23.767
Yeah. Now that is a fuckin' miscarriage.

27:56.508 --> 27:58.385
Hey. So?

27:58.468 --> 28:01.304
How's my star?
You got your own dressing room yet?

28:02.514 --> 28:03.681
What happened?

28:04.474 --> 28:05.433
Hey.

28:06.017 --> 28:08.603
Hey, baby. Come on, talk to me. What's up?
What's wrong?

28:09.938 --> 28:11.231
Sorry, um...

28:12.148 --> 28:14.025
It just got a little intense.

28:15.777 --> 28:16.736
I'm fine.

28:17.278 --> 28:18.279
Okay.

28:26.329 --> 28:29.707
-Keith, my man. What's happening?
-Hey, brother, you look like shit.

28:29.791 --> 28:32.919
I know, I know. I'm not aging well.
I'm not aging well. [laughs]

28:33.586 --> 28:34.754
What do you want, Sam?

28:35.255 --> 28:37.507
Hey, look, I know it was tough today.
All right?

28:37.590 --> 28:40.593
But I'm a director,
I'll do what I need to get what I want.

28:41.177 --> 28:44.305
-That's pretty clear.
-If you keep doing what you did today,

28:44.389 --> 28:46.808
I'll make sure we get you
double your salary.

28:47.392 --> 28:48.393
It's only fair.

28:48.476 --> 28:50.687
Actor and trainer.

28:50.770 --> 28:54.357
You do it all, like Bruce Lee.
Come on, what do you say?

29:00.029 --> 29:03.324
-I'll think about it. See you tomorrow.
-All right, you think about it.

29:03.408 --> 29:04.576
-Good to see you.
-All right.

29:04.659 --> 29:06.703
-Car looks good.
-Thank you, thank you.

29:08.955 --> 29:10.331
That was a yes, right?

29:12.250 --> 29:14.335
Baby, we need to redo the bathroom.

29:14.461 --> 29:15.628
Come on.

29:17.756 --> 29:18.631
Hey!

29:20.216 --> 29:21.259
Are you joining the team?

29:22.302 --> 29:23.470
Is she joining the team?

29:24.471 --> 29:26.347
It's hard to pass up a starring role.

29:27.849 --> 29:30.226
So, we need to pick up Randy
from my parents' house,

29:30.310 --> 29:32.937
and I need chow fun from Two Panda Deli.

29:33.980 --> 29:34.856
[Sam] Okay.

29:38.151 --> 29:39.277
So, uh...

29:39.360 --> 29:40.653
So, I'm fired?

29:40.737 --> 29:43.031
No! Are you an idiot?

29:43.114 --> 29:44.199
You're chum.

29:44.282 --> 29:45.784
You're blood in the water.

29:45.867 --> 29:48.369
Debbie's the hero and you're the villain.

29:48.453 --> 29:49.788
Everybody's gonna hate you!

29:51.706 --> 29:54.334
-I don't want everyone to hate me.
-Oh, Christ.

29:54.417 --> 29:57.045
Crying, caring, the desperation...

29:57.128 --> 29:59.464
That's what makes you unbearable.

30:00.048 --> 30:02.634
Look, I don't like you, Strindberg,
take that in.

30:02.717 --> 30:03.718
Hold on to it.

30:03.802 --> 30:07.096
Try not giving a fuck.
There's a lot of power in that.

30:08.765 --> 30:09.933
And relax,

30:10.683 --> 30:12.936
the devil gets all the best lines.
