00:02.437 --> 00:05.440
Back in the '80s, my brother <i>
was an unlikely ladies' man.</i>

00:05.614 --> 00:07.877
<i>But when</i> <i>
he met Joanne, an equally</i> <i>
unpredictable wildcard,</i>

00:08.051 --> 00:10.140
<i>he finally found</i> <i>
his perfect fit.</i>

00:10.314 --> 00:13.404
Thank you for attending
this emergency presentation

00:13.578 --> 00:16.320
of our plans
for your bachelor
and bachelorette parties.

00:16.494 --> 00:18.105
None of this seems
like an emergency.

00:18.279 --> 00:20.324
Shut up!
Let's begin with diving,

00:20.498 --> 00:22.500
scuba, cliff, and sky.

00:22.674 --> 00:24.154
Your body might explode

00:24.328 --> 00:25.547
from all the drastic changes
in pressure.

00:25.721 --> 00:26.809
Yeah, the only thing
I'm jumping out of

00:26.983 --> 00:28.593
is bed
every morning at 5:00.

00:28.767 --> 00:30.073
More time for
a lazy breakfast
with a book.

00:30.247 --> 00:32.336
Fret not,
my gutless friend.

00:32.510 --> 00:34.686
I'll strap you to my back
so if the chute doesn't open,

00:34.860 --> 00:37.298
we'll smash together
into an indecipherable slop

00:37.472 --> 00:38.864
that our parents will pour
into a single grave.

00:39.039 --> 00:40.910
- Aw.
- Fun.

00:41.084 --> 00:42.042
Joanne,
what do you got for me?

00:42.216 --> 00:44.740
Are we doing
the two-man soup coffin?

00:44.914 --> 00:47.917
Better! We will be flying
to Seville to run with
the bulls!

00:48.091 --> 00:50.267
Or possibly Chicago
to run with Bulls forward
Scottie Pippen.

00:50.441 --> 00:52.095
I prefer neither.

00:52.269 --> 00:53.618
Hell you say?

00:53.792 --> 00:55.925
I spent minutes
on this stuff.

00:56.099 --> 00:58.406
Sorry, we're
just not interested
in group danger or injury.

00:58.580 --> 01:01.409
But it is my duty
as your best man

01:01.583 --> 01:04.368
to possibly ruin your life
with one filthy weekend.

01:04.542 --> 01:06.066
And my duty as a person
who wants to do

01:06.240 --> 01:07.589
improper and vulgar stuff.

01:07.763 --> 01:09.373
We have the solution.

01:09.547 --> 01:11.071
We're going to do a simple,
co-ed weekend

01:11.245 --> 01:13.377
with our friends
- at the beach.
- Boring!

01:13.551 --> 01:14.726
It won't be
as boring as you think

01:14.900 --> 01:16.815
because all of your exes
will be there.

01:16.989 --> 01:17.990
Bar, will you be okay
spending time

01:18.165 --> 01:19.383
with Lainey, Ren,
and Valley Erica?

01:19.557 --> 01:20.863
Worry about them.

01:21.037 --> 01:22.865
I'll be parading around
in my white Speedo

01:23.039 --> 01:24.475
with foxy Joanne
in her white Speedo.

01:24.649 --> 01:26.303
Aw.
Yeah, aw.

01:26.477 --> 01:28.827
Get over here.
Oh, ooh!

01:29.001 --> 01:30.916
<i>♪ I'm twisted up inside</i>

01:31.091 --> 01:33.658
<i>♪ But nonetheless</i> <i>
I feel the need to say</i>

01:36.792 --> 01:38.533
<i>♪ I don't know the future</i>

01:38.707 --> 01:41.536
<i>♪ But the past keeps</i> <i>
getting clearer every day ♪</i>

01:41.710 --> 01:43.712
It was February 23rd, <i>
1980-something,</i>

01:43.886 --> 01:45.583
<i>and my mom was meeting</i> <i>
with the officiant</i>

01:45.757 --> 01:48.020
<i>of my sister's wedding,</i> <i>
my dad's friend, Vic.</i>

01:48.195 --> 01:50.849
And I boned up on
your people's
marriage rituals,

01:51.023 --> 01:52.895
and nowhere
in your sacred texts

01:53.069 --> 01:54.549
is it kosher for
the mother-in-law

01:54.723 --> 01:56.116
to hold hands
with the bride and groom

01:56.290 --> 01:58.161
as they do their vows.

01:58.335 --> 02:00.207
I guess we'll
just have to wait
for our three-person dance.

02:00.381 --> 02:02.252
Beverly, I assume
you've seen

02:02.426 --> 02:03.645
this morning's <i>
Jenkintown Examiner?</i>

02:03.819 --> 02:05.255
Ooh, I love the <i>Examiner.</i>

02:05.429 --> 02:08.432
They did that expose
on the donut place I like.

02:08.606 --> 02:11.696
My love of crullers helped
fund the war in Nicaragua.

02:11.870 --> 02:14.308
No, this is
about our children's
wedding announcement.

02:14.482 --> 02:16.310
Kinda what I wanted to talk
to you about, Beverly.

02:16.484 --> 02:21.010
"Geoffrey Todd Schwartz,
son of L and L Schwartz,

02:21.184 --> 02:23.621
"to wed Erica Goldberg,
daughter of Beverly Goldberg,

02:23.795 --> 02:27.756
"beloved cookbook author,
beloved almost lawyer,

02:27.930 --> 02:30.802
"and beloved Quaker Warden
of William Penn Academy."

02:30.976 --> 02:33.240
Are you concerned there
aren't enough "beloveds?"

02:33.414 --> 02:36.808
I faxed you a cornucopia
of biographical information,

02:36.982 --> 02:39.071
none of which
you included.

02:39.246 --> 02:40.377
Space was limited.

02:40.551 --> 02:43.032
So limited you couldn't
include our first names?

02:43.206 --> 02:45.948
And why is there
a photo of you?

02:46.122 --> 02:48.820
Well, I commissioned
a portrait, but it
wasn't ready.

02:48.994 --> 02:50.866
Now, thanks
for stopping by,

02:51.040 --> 02:52.737
but I have a wedding
to plan.

02:52.911 --> 02:55.044
Well, why don't I take
something off your hands?

02:55.218 --> 02:57.916
Uh, well,
you could valet the cars?

02:58.090 --> 02:59.744
I'm the father
of the groom.

02:59.918 --> 03:03.661
Also, I can't get in and out
of those low Japanese models.

03:03.835 --> 03:06.490
How 'bout this?
I make the video tribute.

03:06.664 --> 03:07.926
Adam's on that.

03:08.100 --> 03:09.711
Oh, Adam's
not on that.

03:09.885 --> 03:12.496
These are the last
couple months with
m'lady friend, Brea,

03:12.670 --> 03:15.673
so I'm kinda trying to...
you know, make hay.

03:15.847 --> 03:17.545
The fellas get it.

03:17.719 --> 03:19.677
- Not really.
- A little shame is a good thing, son.

03:19.851 --> 03:21.505
So it's decided then.

03:21.679 --> 03:23.333
Now if you'll excuse me,

03:23.507 --> 03:24.856
I probably should return
this to the library.

03:26.728 --> 03:28.033
You gotta spy on Lou
while he makes this video.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.514
- No thanks!
- Yes, thanks!

03:30.688 --> 03:33.213
This wedding is a sacred event
to our family.

03:33.387 --> 03:35.650
I need to know if Lou Schwartz
is doing me dirty!

03:35.824 --> 03:37.304
Doing you dirty?

03:37.478 --> 03:39.175
The man has season tickets
to something called

03:39.349 --> 03:41.177
"Jazz Under the Stars."

03:41.351 --> 03:42.700
I'll buy you something
expensive.

03:42.874 --> 03:44.659
That's all
you had to say.

03:44.833 --> 03:47.052
While my mom suspected <i>
Lou was up to no good,</i>

03:47.227 --> 03:49.707
<i>Geoff and Erica were down</i> <i>
the shore for their</i> <i>
big weekend.</i>

03:49.881 --> 03:51.187
What's with the flowers?

03:51.361 --> 03:52.971
They're for Barry's exes.

03:53.145 --> 03:54.059
He thought
it'd be a nice way
to welcome them.

03:54.234 --> 03:55.235
While my former lovers

03:55.409 --> 03:56.497
may no longer be able

03:56.671 --> 03:57.628
to enjoy my ripped bod

03:57.802 --> 03:59.369
or neon charisma,

03:59.543 --> 04:00.892
these flowers from
the open lot across
the street

04:01.066 --> 04:01.850
should ease the longing.

04:02.024 --> 04:03.417
I'm gonna ignore it all

04:03.591 --> 04:04.679
and ask that you never
- say "lovers" again.
- Hi.

04:05.854 --> 04:07.072
JTP!

04:07.247 --> 04:09.292
JTP! My boys
are in the house!

04:09.466 --> 04:10.902
Yeah, we are!

04:11.076 --> 04:13.165
- And we're psyched, man!
- Totally.

04:13.340 --> 04:14.732
When we first heard
you were doing something
nontraditional,

04:14.906 --> 04:16.604
we were like, "What?"

04:16.778 --> 04:18.519
Yeah, but then we realized
we're single men.

04:18.693 --> 04:19.998
We can do unspeakable acts
any time we want.

04:20.172 --> 04:21.391
Oh, big time.

04:21.565 --> 04:23.001
I am just
one bad choice away

04:23.175 --> 04:24.829
from ruining my life
and many others.

04:25.003 --> 04:26.483
Well, why don't you dip
your toes in these
rough waters

04:26.657 --> 04:27.963
and try
this crudites plate?

04:28.137 --> 04:29.573
Oh, carrot crazy.

04:29.747 --> 04:31.358
We made it!

04:31.532 --> 04:33.577
Barely. We had a little
problem with our flight.

04:33.751 --> 04:36.058
Uh, a flight of tequila
at our stopover
in Detroit.

04:36.232 --> 04:38.321
Yeah. I like
the clear kind
and also the other kind.

04:38.495 --> 04:40.149
- Oh.
- So much.

04:40.323 --> 04:43.065
There they are,
all my former flames.

04:43.239 --> 04:45.241
Just a little bit dimmer.

04:45.415 --> 04:47.287
Here, let me throw
some kerosene
on that.

04:47.461 --> 04:48.505
And what are these for?

04:48.679 --> 04:49.680
For your bravery.

04:49.854 --> 04:51.682
Why are we brave,
exactly?

04:51.856 --> 04:54.294
Well, you showed up here
at the great personal cost

04:54.468 --> 04:55.773
of being around me

04:55.947 --> 04:58.863
and my erotically
potent lady friend, Joanne.

04:59.037 --> 05:00.952
She's also my sister,
so it takes time
getting used to.

05:01.126 --> 05:03.912
Anyway, you gutsy spinsters
need help with your bags?

05:04.086 --> 05:04.956
Oh, we're good.
The guys are on it.

05:05.130 --> 05:07.916
Guys? On it? Good?

05:08.090 --> 05:11.311
Everyone,
this is my husband,
Dr. Stephen Stephens.

05:11.485 --> 05:13.269
His name is ridiculous,
but he is rad.

05:13.443 --> 05:14.705
It's nice to meet
all of you.

05:14.879 --> 05:17.186
Oh, I should
take this.

05:17.360 --> 05:19.406
Dan Majerle
pulled his groin again.

05:19.580 --> 05:20.798
"Thunder" Dan Majerle
from the Phoenix Suns?

05:20.972 --> 05:22.539
Dr. Steve is their doctor.

05:22.713 --> 05:24.628
He's, like, always dealing
with their groins.

05:24.802 --> 05:26.064
You hear that, Bar?

05:26.238 --> 05:27.892
Dr. Stevie Stevenson
has your dream job.

05:28.066 --> 05:29.981
Please.

05:30.155 --> 05:32.244
Does he also own a secret
chocolate factory
on the side,

05:32.419 --> 05:33.637
but instead of chocolate,
it's biscuits?

05:33.811 --> 05:36.597
I just met him,
but I'm 100% certain no.

05:36.771 --> 05:37.772
- No, right?
- No, it's definitely no.

05:37.946 --> 05:38.860
- No.
- Oh!

05:39.034 --> 05:41.036
This is my special guy.
Mwah!

05:41.210 --> 05:43.255
- Also Steve.
- Am I crazy, or does he look familiar?

05:43.430 --> 05:44.605
Okay, nobody freak out,

05:44.779 --> 05:46.476
but Steve is one
of Willie Aames' stand-ins

05:46.650 --> 05:48.043
on the TV show <i>
Charles in Charge.</i>

05:48.217 --> 05:51.481
Oh, so cool!
Big deal.

05:51.655 --> 05:54.092
So you have his curls,
his dimples, his easy way.

05:54.266 --> 05:55.659
You don't have
his bank account.

05:55.833 --> 05:57.618
No, but my dad invented
two-sided tape,

05:57.792 --> 05:59.184
so I'm much richer.

05:59.359 --> 06:00.360
<i>Bonjour!</i>

06:00.534 --> 06:02.666
- Is place?
- Is place. Come here.

06:02.840 --> 06:05.103
Guys, meet my
new boy toy, Stephan.

06:05.277 --> 06:06.453
He's very pretty.

06:06.627 --> 06:09.499
Yeah, he is,
and so tall, too.

06:09.673 --> 06:11.545
We're gonna be
fast friends.

06:11.719 --> 06:14.504
Uh, unlikely.
The only English
he knows is "Is place?"

06:14.678 --> 06:16.898
Oh, then how'd you two
get together?

06:17.072 --> 06:19.857
You know, we have
other ways of communicating.

06:20.031 --> 06:21.381
- Mmm-hmm.
- Mmm-hmm.

06:21.555 --> 06:23.339
Okay, who wants
- top bunk?
- Whoo!

06:23.513 --> 06:25.689
- This way.
- That way.

06:25.863 --> 06:27.735
I guess she's just
gonna keep us
hanging on the other ways.

06:27.909 --> 06:30.041
Barry, this is great.

06:30.215 --> 06:31.434
You were worried
about nothing.

06:31.608 --> 06:33.523
All of your exes
are thriving.

06:33.697 --> 06:37.527
Oh, sweet, impossibly naive
Joanne, don't you see?

06:37.701 --> 06:39.486
They're not thriving.
They're dying inside.

06:39.660 --> 06:41.313
- They are?
- Yes.

06:41.488 --> 06:43.490
It's all an elaborate,
multi-person charade

06:43.664 --> 06:45.492
to hide their true feelings
for <i>moi.</i>

06:45.666 --> 06:47.450
It would be sad
if it wasn't hilarious.

06:47.624 --> 06:49.626
Laugh with me.

06:52.934 --> 06:55.502
<i>As Barry was seeing his exes</i> <i>
in a new light,</i>

06:55.676 --> 06:57.634
<i>something dark was going on</i> <i>
with Lou's wedding tribute.</i>

06:57.808 --> 06:59.419
Hi, Dr. Schwartz.

06:59.593 --> 07:00.637
My mom sent me over
with some family photos

07:00.811 --> 07:02.291
for the wedding
montage video.

07:02.465 --> 07:04.032
I'll be sure to add them
to the pile.

07:04.206 --> 07:06.469
My mom was also hoping
I could help out
with the video.

07:06.643 --> 07:09.472
No need.
I've already hired a pro.

07:09.646 --> 07:12.083
Oddly, his name
is also Adam Goldberg.

07:12.257 --> 07:14.912
Well, well,
Adam Goldberg the lesser.

07:15.086 --> 07:16.174
You two know each other?

07:16.348 --> 07:19.439
Former foes,
current apathetic
acquaintances.

07:19.613 --> 07:20.918
Future who knows.

07:21.092 --> 07:22.050
I thought
you moved to Hollywood

07:22.224 --> 07:23.878
to work
in the dream factories.

07:24.052 --> 07:27.098
I did, armed with the best <i>
Mr. Belvedere</i> script
ever written.

07:27.272 --> 07:28.578
The studio brass said that?

07:28.752 --> 07:31.973
My nana did.
She's impeccable with story.

07:32.147 --> 07:34.976
Unfortunately, the entirety
of show business disagreed.

07:35.150 --> 07:36.281
None of this came out
in the interview,

07:36.456 --> 07:37.457
but thanks for
dropping by, Adam.

07:37.631 --> 07:39.154
I'd like him to stay.

07:39.328 --> 07:41.504
I need some extra hands
sorting all this crap.

07:41.678 --> 07:43.767
You mean my treasured
family memories?

07:43.941 --> 07:45.465
It's pictures
set to music.

07:45.639 --> 07:47.336
It ain't <i>Belvedere,</i>
brother.

07:47.510 --> 07:49.556
Maybe I can see
- what you have so far?
- No, no, no, no.

07:49.730 --> 07:52.689
You can start by fueling up
our creative tanks
with coffee.

07:52.863 --> 07:54.822
Oh, I'm no good
with tasks.

07:54.996 --> 07:56.780
That's the industry, kid.

07:56.954 --> 07:58.390
You start at the bottom
and work your way up

07:58.565 --> 08:01.568
to paying rent
to live in your
nana's sunroom.

08:01.742 --> 08:03.613
<i>And so, instead</i> <i>
of keeping an eye on Lou,</i>

08:03.787 --> 08:06.790
<i>I was keeping an eye</i> <i>
on his lengthy to-do list.</i>

08:06.964 --> 08:08.618
I got the dry cleaning.

08:08.792 --> 08:09.750
It would've been easier
if you had given me
the ticket,

08:09.924 --> 08:11.882
or the address.

08:12.056 --> 08:13.580
I'm back from the vet.

08:13.754 --> 08:16.800
Mitzy's anal glands
are officially expressed.

08:16.974 --> 08:19.803
Back from all the McDonald's
in the Philly area.

08:19.977 --> 08:22.066
Turns out it's not
Shamrock Shake season,

08:22.240 --> 08:24.286
as I gently
tried to explain to you.

08:24.460 --> 08:25.809
I'm back.

08:25.983 --> 08:27.637
Where's Lou?

08:27.811 --> 08:30.118
I somehow found
extra-large toenail clippers.

08:30.292 --> 08:33.556
Wait, you haven't even
cracked open my mom's
photo album yet.

08:33.730 --> 08:36.298
Welcome to the nasty side
of weddings, pal.

08:36.472 --> 08:38.343
It's not all about
the happy couple's
special day.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.128
What are you saying?

08:40.302 --> 08:42.870
I'm saying this video tribute
is all Schwartz.

08:43.044 --> 08:45.089
<i>As Lou was putting</i> <i>
his family front and center,</i>

08:45.263 --> 08:46.874
<i>my brother</i> <i>
was calling for backup.</i>

08:47.048 --> 08:48.615
Thank you for coming to

08:48.789 --> 08:51.226
this emergency 6:00 a.m.
meeting of the JTP.

08:51.400 --> 08:52.880
You told us
there'd be bagels and OJ.

08:53.054 --> 08:55.143
That was a cover
for the reason
we're gathering,

08:55.317 --> 08:57.188
to stop my exes
from ruining this weekend.

08:57.362 --> 08:58.755
But there's a poppy seed
and juice in front of you...

08:58.929 --> 09:00.017
That's where I got

09:00.191 --> 09:01.889
the idea for the lie.

09:02.063 --> 09:03.020
Think before
you interrupt me,

09:03.194 --> 09:04.631
Matt Bradley.

09:04.805 --> 09:06.154
How exactly are Lainey, Ren,
and Valley Erica

09:06.328 --> 09:07.285
ruining the weekend?

09:07.459 --> 09:09.070
Well, it's become
painfully clear

09:09.244 --> 09:10.985
that they're not over me
and desperately want me back.

09:11.159 --> 09:12.377
That is not clear.

09:12.552 --> 09:13.944
One of them is married.

09:14.118 --> 09:16.164
Yeah, last night I heard
Stephan and Ren's

09:16.338 --> 09:17.557
fondness for each other
through the wall.

09:17.731 --> 09:19.428
They snatched up
a trio of losers

09:19.602 --> 09:21.082
to try and ease
the pain of seeing me.

09:21.256 --> 09:23.867
Dude. Steve runs
with the brat pack's B-team,

09:24.041 --> 09:25.869
Dr. Steve rebuilt
Jeff Hornacek's knee,

09:26.043 --> 09:27.262
and Stephan's butt and jaw
were just featured

09:27.436 --> 09:29.525
in a Calvin Klein
magazine ad!

09:29.699 --> 09:31.005
I took a look.
It's nice.

09:31.179 --> 09:33.355
But do they have
what I have?

09:33.529 --> 09:34.835
An exaggerated sense
of self-worth?

09:35.009 --> 09:36.967
A big toe
with a really small nail?

09:37.141 --> 09:38.665
I was going
to say the nail thing.

09:38.839 --> 09:41.058
Barry magic.

09:41.232 --> 09:42.538
So there's only
one thing to do.

09:42.712 --> 09:44.975
Nothing.
It's obviously nothing.

09:45.149 --> 09:48.544
I will shame their boyfriends
with my intense masculinity

09:48.718 --> 09:51.112
until they are forced to leave
under a cloud of humiliation.

09:51.286 --> 09:52.722
How would that
help anything?

09:52.896 --> 09:55.377
It will force my exes to admit
their undying love for me.

09:55.551 --> 09:59.424
Then, after many tears,
we can all begin to heal.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.209
I guess from a twisted,
shoehorned,

10:01.383 --> 10:04.081
almost 100% wrong
point of view, that makes
some sense.

10:04.255 --> 10:06.562
- Some indeed.
- Great news!

10:06.736 --> 10:08.695
Today, we're going to
have some fun playing
The Bach-lympics.

10:08.869 --> 10:10.610
It's a combination
of "bachelor"
and "Olympics."

10:10.784 --> 10:12.089
Everybody gets it, Geoff.

10:12.263 --> 10:13.917
Anyway, we're going to be
playing games.

10:14.091 --> 10:16.746
Physical and mental challenges

10:16.920 --> 10:20.315
that showcase one's dominance
over weaker foes.

10:20.489 --> 10:22.143
It's perfect.

10:22.317 --> 10:23.927
Your tone and words suggest
you're not approaching this

10:24.101 --> 10:26.408
with the fun
that's intended,
but okay.

10:26.582 --> 10:29.324
I will crush these men
under my Jordans.

10:29.498 --> 10:32.283
Or flip-flops
if it's on the sand.

10:32.457 --> 10:33.850
This seems like
a huge mistake.

10:34.024 --> 10:35.722
I'm too tired and hungry
to stop him.

10:35.896 --> 10:37.201
I would not wear flip-flops
with your weird big toe.

10:42.816 --> 10:45.035
<i>Lou had cut</i> <i>
our family from the wedding</i> <i>
video tribute,</i>

10:45.209 --> 10:46.515
<i>and it was up to me</i> <i>
to tell my mom.</i>

10:46.689 --> 10:48.648
Hey, Mr. Brown,
is my mom around?

10:48.822 --> 10:50.650
She stepped out to yell
at a wedding vendor.

10:50.824 --> 10:52.521
Something about destroying
their entire lineage

10:52.695 --> 10:53.914
if they don't get
the stemware correct.

10:54.088 --> 10:55.698
She's a volatile lady.

10:55.872 --> 10:57.221
She's not gonna take
what I have to say easy.

10:57.395 --> 10:59.833
Lay down
your burden, Adam.

11:00.007 --> 11:02.966
I'm a deacon, and that means
more than just driving

11:03.140 --> 11:05.621
the church shuttle to and from
the devotional softball game.

11:05.795 --> 11:07.667
That kind of
sounds official.

11:07.841 --> 11:10.191
Lou's not including our family
in the video montage at all.

11:10.365 --> 11:13.020
Oh, no!
I can't know that!

11:13.194 --> 11:16.806
You have to tell your mother
so her and Lou

11:16.980 --> 11:20.114
can, uh, discuss this calmly
and rationally, as adults.

11:20.288 --> 11:22.029
Calm? Rational?

11:22.203 --> 11:23.552
Those words don't sound like
things my mom is

11:23.726 --> 11:24.422
or ever will be.

11:24.596 --> 11:26.250
There's my Schmoo.

11:26.424 --> 11:28.252
Did you find out Lou's
trying to steal
the wedding yet?

11:28.426 --> 11:31.560
- How'd you know?
- That overstuffed pastry bag was so obvious.

11:31.734 --> 11:34.084
Come on,
dish the dirt to Mama.

11:34.258 --> 11:36.565
He's not using a single photo
of us in the video.

11:36.739 --> 11:38.654
But we can still
be reasonable
about this.

11:38.828 --> 11:40.525
I'll be as reasonable
with the seating chart

11:40.700 --> 11:42.310
as he's being
with the video.

11:42.484 --> 11:44.834
Say hello to the parking lot,
Lou's cousin Glen.

11:45.008 --> 11:47.794
Oh, but Cousin Glen's
flying in from
Shaker Heights!

11:47.968 --> 11:49.970
- I can't be a part of this.
- Too late.

11:50.144 --> 11:51.362
You are gonna go destroy
that tape

11:51.536 --> 11:52.799
if you have to burn
the place to the ground.

11:54.148 --> 11:55.192
That's arson.

11:55.366 --> 11:56.977
Only if you
get caught. Go!

11:57.151 --> 11:58.674
Thanks for the help,
Deacon Do Nothing.

11:58.848 --> 12:00.502
Only God can judge me.

12:00.676 --> 12:02.896
And I imagine
he isn't pleased.

12:03.070 --> 12:04.854
<i>While my mom was settling</i> <i>
the score with Lou,</i>

12:05.028 --> 12:07.030
<i>Barry was attempting to score</i> <i>
in The Bach-lympics.</i>

12:08.466 --> 12:10.555
Okay, one, two,
three, toss!

12:10.730 --> 12:12.253
<i>First was the egg toss.</i>

12:13.863 --> 12:16.736
Damn it, Naked Rob!
How about a heads up?

12:16.910 --> 12:18.476
<i>Next was the quick change.</i>

12:18.650 --> 12:19.956
Alright, Stephan and I
are done!

12:22.916 --> 12:26.093
Ooh-la-la!
That's what
I'm taking home.

12:26.267 --> 12:27.398
This is rigged!

12:27.572 --> 12:29.574
Stephan's a model!
He changes clothes
for a living!

12:29.749 --> 12:31.881
<i>And then came</i> <i>
the name-guessing game.</i>

12:32.055 --> 12:33.448
Okay, it's two words.
The first is your dream job.

12:33.622 --> 12:34.710
- Ninja.
- No.

12:34.884 --> 12:36.364
- Vampire hunter.
- No.

12:36.538 --> 12:37.365
Intercontinental -wrestling champion?
- No!

12:37.539 --> 12:39.193
And time.

12:39.367 --> 12:41.543
"Dr. Zhivago"?

12:41.717 --> 12:43.893
That's not anyone's name.
I demand a fourth do-over.

12:44.067 --> 12:46.243
No. And it's time
to check our leaderboard.

12:46.417 --> 12:47.462
Ooh!

12:47.636 --> 12:48.855
Impossible!

12:49.029 --> 12:51.161
Barry... You're all cheating

12:51.335 --> 12:53.033
by being knowledgeable about
your partners and the world!

12:53.207 --> 12:55.644
Off I go!

12:55.818 --> 12:58.342
<i>As my brother</i> <i>
had lost his grip</i> <i>
on the Steves,</i>

12:58.516 --> 13:01.519
<i>my mom had sent me</i> <i>
to get my hands on</i> <i>
Lou's wedding tribute.</i>

13:01.693 --> 13:04.000
Hey. Did you finish
the video yet?

13:04.174 --> 13:06.307
Just slapped
my "a film by" credit on

13:06.481 --> 13:08.178
to let the crew know
they're just cogs.

13:08.352 --> 13:11.181
<i>And just like that,</i> <i>
I was alone with the tape.</i>

13:11.355 --> 13:13.227
<i>It would be so easy</i> <i>
to destroy.</i>

13:13.923 --> 13:15.403
Hello, Adam.

13:15.577 --> 13:16.796
<i>Or not.</i>

13:16.970 --> 13:18.754
What have you got
in your hand there?

13:18.928 --> 13:19.711
Just your finished video.

13:19.886 --> 13:21.626
Easy now.

13:21.801 --> 13:25.326
Set the tape down, slow.

13:25.500 --> 13:27.894
I think I'm gonna hold onto it
for a sec.

13:28.068 --> 13:29.330
Don't do
anything stupid, son.

13:33.203 --> 13:34.335
There!

13:34.509 --> 13:35.553
We're all safe now.

13:35.727 --> 13:37.338
Argh! Dr. Schwartz, please!

13:37.512 --> 13:39.557
As a doctor,
a pillar of the community,

13:39.731 --> 13:41.864
and as a father,
don't do this.

13:42.038 --> 13:43.039
Be the bigger man.

13:43.213 --> 13:45.520
Maybe you're right.

13:45.694 --> 13:47.348
Maybe I have taken this
too far.

13:47.522 --> 13:48.610
It's okay.

13:48.784 --> 13:50.699
You're not the only one.

13:50.873 --> 13:52.919
You should see what my mom was
doing to the seating chart.

13:53.093 --> 13:54.355
- Oh?
- Well, let's just say

13:54.529 --> 13:56.531
your family was pushed
behind the carving station.

13:56.705 --> 13:58.750
I understand.

13:58.925 --> 14:01.101
I don't understand!

14:01.275 --> 14:03.755
Cousin Marlene
is in the overflow room?

14:03.930 --> 14:06.367
- She has a palsied foot!
- You like that?

14:06.541 --> 14:09.239
Well, wait till you see
where I put your parents.

14:09.413 --> 14:12.068
The freight elevator,
next to Great Uncle Yankel?

14:12.242 --> 14:14.157
You with Bev,
you get

14:14.331 --> 14:15.463
Okay, there's
the low point.

14:15.637 --> 14:18.466
- The wedding is off!
- And yet lower we go.

14:18.640 --> 14:21.208
You can't call the wedding off
because I'm calling it off.

14:21.382 --> 14:22.557
Neither of you can
call it off.

14:22.731 --> 14:23.950
Fine! The wedding is back on,

14:24.124 --> 14:26.517
but I will make sure
it is terrible for you.

14:26.691 --> 14:29.259
Oh, you don't know
terrible!

14:29.433 --> 14:32.262
Trust me, no one
knows terrible more
than she does, man.

14:32.436 --> 14:34.656
<i>As the wedding battle</i> <i>
hit a fever pitch,</i>

14:34.830 --> 14:37.659
<i>my brother was taking</i> <i>
one last swing</i> <i>
at beating the Steves.</i>

14:37.833 --> 14:39.748
The trophy goes to...

14:39.922 --> 14:43.012
Me! Or it will,
after our last competition,

14:43.186 --> 14:47.625
a rap battle between me
and Dr. Steve for 100 points.

14:47.799 --> 14:48.757
You're behind by 200.

14:48.931 --> 14:51.194
One million points.

14:51.368 --> 14:52.369
Yeah, let me just
check the rules.

14:52.543 --> 14:54.589
- No.
- It's agreed.

14:54.763 --> 14:55.895
Dr. Steve,
do you accept
my challenge,

14:56.069 --> 14:58.288
or do you admit defeat?

14:58.462 --> 15:00.421
Sorry, um, I was on the phone
with the Suns' gorilla.

15:00.595 --> 15:01.726
He twisted his ankle
on a trampoline jam.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.206
Are you talking to me?

15:03.380 --> 15:05.252
Barry, can I talk
to you privately?

15:05.426 --> 15:07.776
Not now. I'm about to drop
some funky cold medina.

16:21.023 --> 16:22.590
I have two words
for you... Nice job?

16:22.764 --> 16:24.853
You suck and you're old!

16:25.027 --> 16:26.681
Well, that was five words,
and I'm 36.

16:26.855 --> 16:29.292
My God, enough!

16:29.466 --> 16:31.555
This whole weekend,
you've been trying
to impress your exes,

16:31.729 --> 16:33.253
barely paying
attention to me.

16:33.427 --> 16:35.385
You're not over
any of them.

16:35.559 --> 16:37.518
But at least now it's clear
who you are over.

16:37.692 --> 16:38.780
Me.

16:39.911 --> 16:40.912
- Joanne, come on.
- Mmm-mmm.

16:44.829 --> 16:48.311
<i>Thanks to my mom and Lou,</i> <i>
the wedding was falling apart.</i>

16:48.485 --> 16:50.096
<i>So I decided to try</i> <i>
and put it back together.</i>

16:50.270 --> 16:52.098
I need to make things right,
and I need your help to do it.

16:52.272 --> 16:54.100
That's what Wesley said in
season two's seminal episode,

16:54.274 --> 16:56.232
"Requiem." <i>Mr. Belvedere?</i>

16:56.406 --> 16:58.104
Sorry. Sometimes,
I forget the world at large

16:58.278 --> 17:00.280
doesn't share my passion
for all things Belv.

17:00.454 --> 17:02.630
Look, I know
if we work together,

17:02.804 --> 17:05.850
we can make a wedding tribute
video so magical,

17:06.025 --> 17:07.417
it could end
all this madness.

17:07.591 --> 17:09.506
But if you won't do it
for love or art,

17:09.680 --> 17:11.073
would you do it for money?

17:11.247 --> 17:11.943
You had me at money.

17:13.945 --> 17:15.817
<i>And just like that,</i> <i>
we got down to work.</i>

17:15.991 --> 17:18.080
<i>We used Schwartz photos,</i> <i>
Goldberg photos,</i>

17:18.254 --> 17:20.213
<i>even my home movies.</i>

17:20.387 --> 17:22.867
<i>And so I gathered the folks</i> <i>
who needed to see it most.</i>

17:24.826 --> 17:26.349
Up next, Mr. Belvedere.

17:26.523 --> 17:27.524
"Mr. Belvedere"?

17:27.698 --> 17:29.352
I'll tell you
what it's not,

17:29.526 --> 17:31.833
loving pictures of our family
set to a James Taylor song!

17:32.007 --> 17:34.096
Damn it,
it happened again.

17:34.270 --> 17:36.185
Those trucker pills were
supposed to keep me focused.

17:36.359 --> 17:38.318
Can I go? I despise
that fussbottom butler.

17:38.492 --> 17:41.408
Maybe because
he reminds you of you,

17:41.582 --> 17:43.366
a cranky buttinsky
who oversteps his role!

17:43.540 --> 17:44.933
Oh, hell no!

17:45.107 --> 17:46.282
I will not stand here
while you sully

17:46.456 --> 17:47.979
Lynn Aloysius Belvedere's
good name!

17:48.154 --> 17:49.155
Aloysius?

17:49.329 --> 17:51.113
Guys!
We wanted to remind you

17:51.287 --> 17:53.159
that weddings are about
coming together,

17:53.333 --> 17:56.640
joining forces,
and being better for it.

17:56.814 --> 17:58.599
Erica and Geoff
are making a commitment

17:58.773 --> 18:01.428
to spend the rest
of their lives together.

18:01.602 --> 18:03.082
Why can't you celebrate that?

18:03.256 --> 18:04.648
I have been.

18:04.822 --> 18:06.476
At the exclusion
of the Schwartzes!

18:06.650 --> 18:09.000
He went too far
with the video,

18:09.175 --> 18:10.785
but this all started
with that wedding
announcement.

18:10.959 --> 18:12.830
That was very hurtful.

18:13.004 --> 18:15.268
I know. I'm sorry.

18:15.442 --> 18:17.444
It's just you're
this accomplished
eye doctor,

18:17.618 --> 18:20.055
and I'm just
the mother of the bride.

18:20.229 --> 18:23.145
I wanted
to feel important, too.

18:23.319 --> 18:26.627
Beverly, you're
incredibly important.

18:26.801 --> 18:29.499
You raised
a wonderful daughter

18:29.673 --> 18:32.589
that we're beyond delighted
to welcome into our family.

18:32.763 --> 18:34.374
And two great sons.

18:34.548 --> 18:35.331
If you say so.

18:36.985 --> 18:38.421
You're right.

18:38.595 --> 18:39.944
I am a mother and a hero.

18:43.122 --> 18:44.819
See, this is
what it's all about.

18:44.993 --> 18:46.690
You know what?

18:46.864 --> 18:48.170
It is
what it's all about.

18:48.344 --> 18:49.867
I have so much work
to do.

18:50.041 --> 18:53.219
Making a montage video that
includes both of our families?

18:53.393 --> 18:55.656
No, man.
I'm gonna take another crack
at my Belv script.

18:55.830 --> 18:57.571
Toodle-oo.

18:57.745 --> 18:59.529
While my mom and Lou <i>
were making things right,</i>

18:59.703 --> 19:02.053
<i>Barry was trying to figure out
where he went wrong.</i>

19:04.186 --> 19:05.796
Can I ask you guys
something,

19:05.970 --> 19:07.885
based on your
intimate knowledge of me?

19:08.059 --> 19:09.365
You and I kissed once
at a party,

19:09.539 --> 19:11.672
but, sure,
I'll give you life advice.

19:11.846 --> 19:15.545
Why do I always ruin
the good things I have?

19:15.719 --> 19:19.158
Look, Bar, you're
the best, but you can
also be a little...

19:19.332 --> 19:20.420
Emotionally out of control?

19:20.594 --> 19:22.465
I was gonna say intense.

19:22.639 --> 19:24.467
And you're never better than
when you're not worrying about

19:24.641 --> 19:25.642
what other people
think of you.

19:25.816 --> 19:27.775
Or trying to show off.

19:27.949 --> 19:29.907
You have a giant heart,
and you were
a great boyfriend.

19:30.081 --> 19:30.995
I was?

19:31.170 --> 19:32.823
- Yes.
- Absolutely.

19:32.997 --> 19:35.174
I thought your name was Gary
until this weekend.

19:35.348 --> 19:37.828
Just be honest.
No weird plans or schemes.

19:38.002 --> 19:39.787
Just tell her how you feel.

19:39.961 --> 19:41.005
I think I can do that.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.051
We know you can.

19:43.225 --> 19:45.532
I don't know
that you can,
but maybe?

19:50.101 --> 19:52.234
Joanne, I know
I've been a jerk.

19:52.930 --> 19:54.323
Yeah, you have.

19:54.497 --> 19:57.674
Look, all the women
I ever dated

19:57.848 --> 20:00.938
are now with amazing men,
so I freaked out.

20:01.112 --> 20:02.418
Because you're jealous.
Yeah, I get it.

20:02.592 --> 20:05.291
Because I got scared
that you might be
the next one

20:05.465 --> 20:06.379
to leave me
and go find your Steve.

20:07.858 --> 20:08.642
You really think that?

20:10.426 --> 20:13.081
Seems to be the pattern.

20:13.255 --> 20:16.302
Barry, I would never dump you
for some amazing guy

20:18.521 --> 20:19.479
because you're
my amazing guy.

20:21.916 --> 20:23.961
You're my Steve.

20:24.135 --> 20:25.311
Guess I am the big winner
this weekend.

20:25.485 --> 20:26.703
Yeah, you are.

20:26.877 --> 20:28.618
<i>♪ Oh</i> We both are.

20:28.792 --> 20:30.794
<i>♪ Bring me higher love ♪</i>

20:32.361 --> 20:34.363
<i>Weddings bring</i> <i>
people together.</i>

20:34.537 --> 20:35.973
<i>The stress</i> <i>
that comes with them</i>

20:36.147 --> 20:37.453
<i>can sometimes</i> <i>
drive them apart.</i>

20:37.627 --> 20:40.978
Give it up for Dr. Steve!

20:41.152 --> 20:43.981
<i>But then again, what brings</i> <i>
everybody back together</i>

20:44.155 --> 20:46.549
<i>is remembering why they were</i> <i>
all there in the first place.</i>

20:46.723 --> 20:48.595
<i>'Cause when you</i> <i>
celebrate love</i>

20:48.769 --> 20:50.901
<i>with the people</i> <i>
you care about the most,</i>

20:51.075 --> 20:53.469
<i>there's no such thing</i> <i>
as a bad seat.</i>

20:53.643 --> 20:56.037
Don't worry, kids,
the wedding is back on.

20:56.211 --> 20:57.734
- What?
- I don't even want to know.

20:57.908 --> 20:59.388
<i>Even if getting there</i>

20:59.562 --> 21:00.215
<i>can sometimes be</i> <i>
a little confusing.</i>

21:03.262 --> 21:06.830
Uh-oh. We still don't have
a seat for your Aunt Edna.

21:07.004 --> 21:09.485
That woman is a pill.
She always pats my belly
and says,

21:09.659 --> 21:11.008
"Looks like
you're having twins."

21:11.182 --> 21:12.749
Screw you, Aunt Edna!

21:12.923 --> 21:14.751
At least I have eyebrows.

21:14.925 --> 21:17.319
Well, why don't
we put Aunt Edna
in the caterer's kitchen?

21:17.493 --> 21:19.234
I like where
your head's at.

21:19.408 --> 21:22.411
And I am not fond of my cousin
Ronnie who still cleans pools,

21:22.585 --> 21:24.108
so why don't we put him
in the smoking section?

21:25.545 --> 21:26.807
We work well together.

21:26.981 --> 21:28.374
Weddings really do bring out
the best in people.
