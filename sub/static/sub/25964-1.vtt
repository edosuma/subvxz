Okay, so, do you want to wait
'til the morning

37:54.200 --> 37:56.065
to drive to Jackson?

37:56.067 --> 37:59.999
Or we'll leave tonight,
beat the traffic?

38:00.001 --> 38:02.532
I know a really romantic spot
on the way... Grenada lake.

38:02.534 --> 38:05.265
Wake up to the beach
outside the window.

38:05.267 --> 38:06.832
I can't go to Jackson

38:06.834 --> 38:11.198
or come back on the tour...
Or not yet.

38:11.200 --> 38:12.732
Seriously? Okay,
you can't just step out

38:12.734 --> 38:14.132
in the middle
of a tour like that, charity.

38:14.134 --> 38:16.998
Jabari, I don't want to,
but I have to.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.798
Kevin's back, and he's not
letting me take Nathan with me.

38:19.800 --> 38:21.765
But you signed a contract.

38:21.767 --> 38:26.065
This is my child
we're taking about.

38:26.067 --> 38:27.732
Look, Jabari,

38:27.734 --> 38:32.732
I just got to figure this out
with Kevin before I leave.

38:32.734 --> 38:34.332
Please.

I know, I know.

38:48.800 --> 38:51.198
Well, look, it's just
time to move on now, okay?

38:51.200 --> 38:53.765
Give god the space
to do his thang!

38:56.067 --> 39:00.198
All right, well, you know
you can call me anytime.

39:00.200 --> 39:02.198
Okay?

39:02.200 --> 39:04.065
All right.

39:04.067 --> 39:06.065
Bye.

39:07.800 --> 39:09.732
That girl is so stupid.

39:11.400 --> 39:13.198
Okay, so what do you think
about this?

39:13.200 --> 39:14.798
Ooh, for the bishop?

39:14.800 --> 39:16.599
Mm-hmm.
Yes.

39:16.601 --> 39:18.665
Child, that man had me alone
in that hotel room

39:18.667 --> 39:20.665
and didn't do a thing.

39:20.667 --> 39:23.132
Well, I guess
I got to step my game up.

39:24.600 --> 39:26.865
Well,
that'll definitely kill 'em.

39:26.867 --> 39:28.465
What a tragedy.

39:34.867 --> 39:37.265
Oh, what about that one?

39:43.167 --> 39:47.132
Hey.
Sorry I'm late.

39:47.134 --> 39:48.832
How was church?

39:50.167 --> 39:51.765
It was strange.

39:51.767 --> 39:53.999
But thank you for asking.

39:55.434 --> 39:57.598
It's the least I could do.

What happened?

40:00.934 --> 40:02.398
This Rochelle cross woman...

40:02.400 --> 40:04.598
She's gotten awfully close
with my father,

40:04.600 --> 40:06.799
and I feel like she's trying
to cozy up to me, too.

40:08.301 --> 40:10.799
What do you think she wants?

40:10.801 --> 40:12.131
I don't know,

40:12.133 --> 40:15.132
but I feel like she's trying to
come between my parents.

40:15.134 --> 40:18.065
I know she's done it
at another church.

40:18.067 --> 40:19.499
She's not gonna do it at mine.

40:19.501 --> 40:20.532
Yours?

40:21.501 --> 40:23.032
That's new.

40:24.667 --> 40:26.865
No matter what my mother thinks,

40:26.867 --> 40:31.365
no matter what she says,
this church matters to me.

40:33.400 --> 40:35.398
My family...

40:35.400 --> 40:36.865
Even more so.
