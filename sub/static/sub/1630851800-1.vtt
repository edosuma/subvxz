WEBVTT

00:11.262 --> 00:14.557
(gentle festive music)

00:17.685 --> 00:19.020
- Not all dogs shed.

00:19.103 --> 00:20.813
Most dogs even have
really clean mouths,

00:20.897 --> 00:22.982
even cleaner than ours.

00:23.065 --> 00:24.775
- If we still had
the downtown office,

00:24.858 --> 00:26.110
we could park in
the lot, but no,

00:26.193 --> 00:28.655
Glenn's decided to move the
whole operation to the suburbs.

00:28.738 --> 00:30.407
- You can even teach dogs
to bring in the papers

00:30.490 --> 00:33.033
so you'd never have to
leave your chair, Dad.

00:33.117 --> 00:34.452
- There's an empty space,

00:34.535 --> 00:36.245
here we go, here we go!

00:36.328 --> 00:37.830
Ah, for crying out loud!

00:37.913 --> 00:41.083
They oughta ban
foreign compact cars.

00:41.167 --> 00:42.543
- Why don't you just
park in the lot.

00:42.627 --> 00:45.463
- (sighing) For
$8? Are you crazy?

00:45.547 --> 00:48.883
You know, the city says it's
free to go ice skating, okay?

00:48.967 --> 00:50.885
The prices of hot chocolate
are inflated twice

00:50.968 --> 00:52.678
that of market value,
and, and, and ice skating

00:52.762 --> 00:55.932
rental fees are outrageous,
and they want $8 for parking?

00:56.015 --> 00:57.350
Not from this buckaroo.

00:57.433 --> 00:58.852
- You show 'em, Dave.

00:58.935 --> 01:00.520
Now listen, I'm putting
all the boys downstairs

01:00.603 --> 01:01.897
together in sleeping bags

01:01.980 --> 01:03.565
so they can beat each other
senseless for all I care.

01:03.648 --> 01:05.858
I swear I've never seen those
boys not punching each other.

01:05.942 --> 01:07.318
- Now, who's in charge
of laying out this city?

01:07.402 --> 01:08.570
That's what I'd like to know.

01:08.653 --> 01:09.987
There's not a single
place to park anywhere.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.572
- I put Matt and Carol
in the blue room.

01:11.655 --> 01:13.407
Oh, and don't mention that
Carol's turning 50 this year.

01:13.492 --> 01:14.992
She's very sensitive to that.

01:15.075 --> 01:15.993
Oh, and do you happen to know

01:16.077 --> 01:17.537
what Daryl got Anna
this year for Christmas?

01:17.620 --> 01:19.038
Last year, he got
her tube socks,

01:19.122 --> 01:20.623
so I went ahead
and sent an email

01:20.707 --> 01:22.375
to make sure that
doesn't happen again.

01:22.458 --> 01:24.002
- Look at this guy!

01:24.085 --> 01:26.378
He's way over the line.
He's taking up two spaces!

01:27.630 --> 01:29.632
- Dave, are, are
you listening to me?

01:29.715 --> 01:30.883
- Yeah, that's fine.

01:30.967 --> 01:31.927
- Did you know that
houses with dogs

01:32.010 --> 01:34.637
are 11% less likely
to be broken into?

01:34.720 --> 01:35.930
It's a fact, I read it.

01:37.098 --> 01:38.850
- I passed this lady
three times now,

01:38.933 --> 01:41.393
and she's still going
through her purse.

01:41.477 --> 01:43.938
Back out, let
somebody else park!

01:44.022 --> 01:46.190
You can go through your
purse when you get home.

01:48.985 --> 01:52.113
- I wish you would just park
the car so we can go downtown.

01:53.363 --> 01:54.990
- Well, I'm trying
to park the car.

01:55.073 --> 01:56.700
I've been trying to park the
car for half an hour now.

01:56.783 --> 01:58.077
- Just park it already.

01:59.662 --> 02:00.997
- Ah-ha, ah-ha!

02:01.915 --> 02:03.958
What's that? You see that?

02:04.042 --> 02:05.042
You see that, Kassandra?

02:05.125 --> 02:06.252
What do you think of that, huh?

02:06.335 --> 02:08.588
- [Kassandra] That's great, Dad.

02:08.672 --> 02:09.922
- Well, you might
not think so now,

02:10.005 --> 02:12.883
but one day when you go to
college, you'll say to yourself,

02:12.967 --> 02:15.010
I'm here because Dad
knew how to save a buck.

02:17.013 --> 02:18.430
- [Kassandra] Alison
just got a dog.

02:18.515 --> 02:20.267
It's all I want for
Christmas, and I was thinking.

02:20.350 --> 02:21.935
- [Sandy] Kassandra,
we've talked about this.

02:22.018 --> 02:24.103
- [Kassandra] But I
would take care of it!

02:24.187 --> 02:25.647
- Did you see this guy?

02:25.730 --> 02:26.940
- [Sandy] We're not
getting a dog, Kassandra.

02:27.023 --> 02:27.773
We've talked about this.

02:27.857 --> 02:29.358
A dog is a big deal.

02:29.442 --> 02:31.402
- Are you blind?
I'm parking here.

02:32.737 --> 02:33.947
Can you believe this guy?

02:35.782 --> 02:37.075
Unbelievable.

02:37.158 --> 02:40.077
- Hey dummy, don't you
see I have my blinker on?

02:40.160 --> 02:41.328
- Jerry!

02:41.412 --> 02:42.955
- What'd you call me?

02:43.038 --> 02:44.123
- You heard me.

02:44.207 --> 02:46.000
- Oh, who cares, just
let him have his spot!

02:46.083 --> 02:48.252
- Let him, let
him have the spot?

02:48.335 --> 02:51.297
What, oh no, look at this,
he's trying to inch up.

02:51.380 --> 02:52.798
Oh no, you don't.

02:54.175 --> 02:56.052
- He's trying to inch back.

02:56.135 --> 02:57.928
I don't believe this.

02:58.012 --> 02:59.638
- (gasps) Dave!

02:59.722 --> 03:00.890
- He just hit me!

03:00.973 --> 03:01.640
- Oh, can we-
- You all saw it!

03:01.723 --> 03:02.975
He just hit me.

03:03.058 --> 03:04.518
- Dave, can we please just
go park in the garage!

03:04.602 --> 03:06.853
- You just caused an
accident, you imbecile!

03:08.355 --> 03:09.982
- Jerry, what are you doing?

03:10.065 --> 03:11.275
- He doesn't wanna move the car?

03:11.358 --> 03:12.735
I'll move it for him.

03:12.818 --> 03:14.987
(cars thudding)
- Dave, oh my gosh!

03:15.070 --> 03:16.655
Oh my gosh, he's pushing on us!

03:16.738 --> 03:17.823
- [Dave] Buckle up, Kassandra!

03:17.907 --> 03:18.617
- What are you gonna do?

03:18.700 --> 03:20.033
What are you doing?

03:20.117 --> 03:21.368
- I didn't buy this SUV so
we could be pushed around.

03:21.452 --> 03:23.245
- Oh, what are you-
- I'm taking the bull

03:23.328 --> 03:24.455
by the horns-
- Dave! (grunts)

03:24.538 --> 03:26.123
- And I'm protecting
our territory.

03:26.207 --> 03:29.127
(engine revving)

03:30.795 --> 03:31.963
Hang on, girls!

03:32.047 --> 03:35.675
(frenetic orchestral music)

03:50.482 --> 03:52.025
- Oh, yeah.

03:52.108 --> 03:54.193
Let's say goodbye to him,
too, when he goes by.

03:54.277 --> 03:54.985
- [Jerry] Now, you feel better?

03:55.068 --> 03:56.028
Thank you!

03:59.407 --> 04:00.283
- [Dave] Well, there you go.

04:00.367 --> 04:01.658
You see what perseverance does?

04:12.170 --> 04:14.172
- How exactly do you
expect me to get out?

04:14.255 --> 04:17.007
And don't even try to tell me
to climb over to your side.

04:23.555 --> 04:25.057
I can't believe you
parked this close.

04:25.140 --> 04:26.558
What were you thinking?
- (sighs) Honey.

04:26.642 --> 04:28.102
- Seriously, it's embarrassing,
what are you doing?

04:28.185 --> 04:30.020
What are, Dave, what
are, what are you doing?

04:30.103 --> 04:32.982
Let go of me, Dave! (screaming)

04:33.065 --> 04:36.110
(bright lively music)

04:36.193 --> 04:39.322
(Sandy gasping)

04:39.405 --> 04:42.117
- All right, who's
ready for ice skating?

04:42.200 --> 04:42.950
- I am!

04:44.160 --> 04:45.787
- [Child] Come on
Amelia, kick the ball!

04:45.870 --> 04:48.748
(children yelling)

04:50.082 --> 04:51.458
- [Child] Hey, look at me!

04:51.542 --> 04:53.418
- [Child] Kick the ball!

04:53.502 --> 04:56.297
- I'm sorry, I got a
little carried away.

04:56.380 --> 04:57.590
- A little?

04:57.673 --> 04:58.925
Dave, you were like
a 12-year-old boy

04:59.008 --> 05:01.010
playing bumper cars
at the amusement park.

05:02.178 --> 05:03.178
- You're right.

05:03.262 --> 05:04.388
You're absolutely right.

05:05.807 --> 05:07.808
- Look, tomorrow my brother
and his family come,

05:07.892 --> 05:11.812
my sister, her husband, your
father, your brother, the kids.

05:11.895 --> 05:13.230
The house is gonna be packed.

05:13.313 --> 05:16.275
I just wanna have a nice
quiet evening with my family.

05:17.110 --> 05:18.527
- Absolutely.

05:18.610 --> 05:22.532
I will be incident-free until
New Year's, scout's honor.

05:22.615 --> 05:24.075
- [Sandy] Okay.

05:24.158 --> 05:24.908
- Okay.

05:26.202 --> 05:29.372
- Mom, can we divide rooms
up by family this year?

05:29.455 --> 05:32.667
- [Sandy] Well, I put you and
all your cousins together.

05:32.750 --> 05:33.542
- [Dave] It's okay.

05:33.625 --> 05:34.793
- Hey, you're hot!

05:37.463 --> 05:39.298
- But I don't wanna share a room

05:39.382 --> 05:40.967
with Dad's side of the family.

05:41.050 --> 05:42.260
- [Dave] Who's that
guy talking to?

05:42.343 --> 05:43.343
- What's wrong with
Dad's side of family?

05:43.427 --> 05:45.303
- [Kassandra] They
snore, all of 'em!

05:45.388 --> 05:48.140
- All Madisons have
sinus problems, honey.

05:48.223 --> 05:49.142
We can't help it.

05:49.225 --> 05:51.935
- Well, I'm a Madison,
and I don't snore.

05:52.018 --> 05:54.938
- That's because you're a
little angel just like Mommy.

05:55.022 --> 05:55.982
- Yeah.
- Drop the zero.

05:56.065 --> 05:57.608
Come hang with a hero.

05:57.692 --> 05:59.277
(teens whistling)

05:59.360 --> 06:00.277
- Who's he talking to?

06:00.360 --> 06:02.238
Is he talking to you?

06:02.322 --> 06:03.740
- Let it go, Dave.

06:03.823 --> 06:06.200
- Hey, trying to spend
Christmas here with my family,

06:06.283 --> 06:07.452
you little hooligan!

06:07.535 --> 06:08.702
- [Sandy] Dave, what
did we just talk about?

06:08.787 --> 06:10.245
- Perfectly calm.

06:11.205 --> 06:12.457
- You know, maybe we should get

06:12.540 --> 06:14.000
a couple of rooms
at the Holiday Inn.

06:14.083 --> 06:15.000
We could afford it.

06:16.002 --> 06:17.878
- What? No, no.

06:17.962 --> 06:20.798
I want the whole family
together for the holidays.

06:20.882 --> 06:22.967
Nobody is going to,
to the Holiday Inn.

06:23.050 --> 06:24.677
- Yeah, but you know what
little space we have.

06:24.760 --> 06:25.970
- Little space?

06:26.053 --> 06:28.138
We live in a 3,000
square foot home

06:28.222 --> 06:29.765
in one of the
nicest neighborhoods

06:29.848 --> 06:31.600
in one of the richest
countries in the world.

06:33.143 --> 06:34.895
- [Teen] You're good, babe.

06:34.978 --> 06:36.938
- Dave, ignore it.

06:37.022 --> 06:37.732
- Ignore what?

06:37.815 --> 06:38.900
I didn't hear anything.

06:40.610 --> 06:42.362
- Mom, my ankles hurt.

06:42.445 --> 06:43.195
- Here.

06:44.822 --> 06:46.073
Why don't you and your
mom go across the street

06:46.157 --> 06:48.492
to Starbucks and
get a hot chocolate.

06:50.285 --> 06:51.912
- What about you, Dad?

06:51.995 --> 06:52.705
- No.

06:53.873 --> 06:55.542
Gonna go pick up a
couple of quick laps,

06:55.625 --> 06:57.710
just like Dad did in
the old college days.

06:57.793 --> 06:59.837
- Just be careful,
that was 25 years ago.

07:00.713 --> 07:02.257
- 24 years ago.

07:02.340 --> 07:04.383
- Just be careful.

07:04.467 --> 07:05.217
- Always.

07:06.718 --> 07:10.055
(bright lively music)

07:11.265 --> 07:12.683
Okay, hot shot.

07:12.767 --> 07:15.018
Let's see how you like
the view from the ice.

07:18.982 --> 07:21.817
(teen thuds)
Oh, pardon me.

07:21.900 --> 07:22.818
You little jerk.

07:26.405 --> 07:28.115
♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells ♪

07:28.198 --> 07:29.950
♪ Jingle all the way ♪

07:30.033 --> 07:33.245
(bright dramatic music)

07:33.328 --> 07:35.247
Do you wanna play rough?

07:35.330 --> 07:36.248
I can play rough.

07:38.918 --> 07:42.422
(teen and Dave grunting)

07:44.340 --> 07:45.382
- [Bystander] Somebody
call the police!

07:45.465 --> 07:46.800
(crowd cheering)

07:46.883 --> 07:47.635
- Dave!

07:55.100 --> 07:58.437
(bright festive music)

08:10.240 --> 08:13.118
(Dave sighing)

08:13.202 --> 08:15.872
(tires spinning)

08:21.710 --> 08:23.295
- Son of a-

08:23.378 --> 08:24.922
- What's the matter?

08:26.173 --> 08:28.175
- We're struck.

08:28.258 --> 08:29.968
- Well, try rocking it.

08:32.513 --> 08:35.432
(tires whirring)

08:41.313 --> 08:43.232
- You're just making
the grooves deeper.

08:43.315 --> 08:45.777
- All right, you
drive, I'll push.

08:52.533 --> 08:56.328
Okay, one, two, three.

08:56.412 --> 08:59.082
(tires whirring)

09:00.123 --> 09:01.333
(Dave grunting)

09:01.417 --> 09:05.503
(bright festive music continues)

09:21.728 --> 09:25.065
Okay, I'm gonna use this board
to wedge it under the wheel,

09:25.148 --> 09:26.608
give it something to grip on to.

09:27.985 --> 09:30.320
When I say hit it, let it rip.

09:34.492 --> 09:36.077
(Dave grunting)

09:36.160 --> 09:37.370
- But, Dad, there isn't any
friction under the board.

09:37.453 --> 09:39.997
When Mom hits the gas
pedal, it's gonna go flying.

09:42.207 --> 09:43.250
- [Dave] Okay.

09:43.333 --> 09:44.210
- [Kassandra] But.

09:44.293 --> 09:45.002
- Hang on, Kassandra.

09:45.085 --> 09:45.962
- [Kassandra] But Mom!

09:47.212 --> 09:49.465
- All right, let her rip.

09:49.548 --> 09:50.507
(tires whirring)

09:50.590 --> 09:51.300
(board thuds)

09:51.383 --> 09:54.345
(Dave yelling)

09:54.428 --> 09:57.598
(gentle upbeat music)

10:17.452 --> 10:19.328
Ah, be careful.
- Okay.

10:19.412 --> 10:21.913
- Well, what happened, then?

10:21.997 --> 10:23.582
- Just a little accident.

10:25.250 --> 10:26.752
- Another accident?

10:28.712 --> 10:33.342
Amazing, Darwin is yet to
finish the bloody fool off.

10:34.552 --> 10:35.552
- Watch out.
- Oh.

10:35.635 --> 10:36.637
- Ow!
- Sorry.

10:37.930 --> 10:39.682
- I'll tell you, ever
since he was a little boy,

10:39.765 --> 10:43.435
that Dave was always quick to
lose his temper. (laughing)

10:43.518 --> 10:44.853
Well, here we are.

10:44.937 --> 10:47.272
It's the morning of December
22nd, and the peace and quiet

10:47.357 --> 10:49.942
of the Madison family
home is about to end,

10:50.025 --> 10:52.403
and the Bavarian horde
of relatives are about

10:52.487 --> 10:55.447
to swoop in like a
level five tsunami.

10:55.530 --> 10:56.657
This ought to be fun.

10:59.743 --> 11:03.247
- [Sandy] Hmm, no,
no, I don't like it.

11:03.330 --> 11:05.708
Let's try moving the
tree by the fireplace.

11:06.667 --> 11:08.960
(Ben snoring)

11:09.045 --> 11:12.130
(light upbeat music)

11:14.007 --> 11:16.635
(Ben moaning)

11:22.933 --> 11:23.683
- [Sandy] Hmm.

11:23.767 --> 11:24.810
- [Dave] Huh, huh?

11:24.893 --> 11:28.063
- Mm, yeah, no. No.

11:29.648 --> 11:34.153
You know what, let's try it,
um, let's try it over there.

11:37.280 --> 11:38.698
- Okay.
- Thanks.

11:40.658 --> 11:43.412
- You are the slowest
driver I've ever seen.

11:43.495 --> 11:44.497
- Maybe you should
say, thank you, Carol,

11:44.580 --> 11:46.665
for getting to my
sister's safely.

11:47.708 --> 11:48.458
- Look at this guy!

11:48.542 --> 11:49.835
Look at this guy!

11:49.918 --> 11:51.295
Are you seriously just
gonna let him cut you off?

11:55.382 --> 11:57.927
(Dave grunting)

11:59.345 --> 12:02.263
- (laughing) No, no.

12:02.347 --> 12:03.182
You know what?

12:03.265 --> 12:05.100
Let's try moving the recliner

12:05.183 --> 12:06.810
and putting the
tree in the corner.

12:07.687 --> 12:09.188
I think that'll look great.

12:09.272 --> 12:10.730
- Me, too.
- Okay.

12:11.565 --> 12:13.067
(Dave grunting)
Careful. Got it?

12:13.150 --> 12:14.568
- Out of my way, you putz.

12:14.652 --> 12:16.028
(horn honking)
Come on!

12:17.488 --> 12:19.573
(Dave panting)

12:19.657 --> 12:20.407
- Mm, no.

12:22.702 --> 12:23.952
- I will stop this car!

12:24.035 --> 12:25.287
I swear to everything holy,

12:25.370 --> 12:27.247
I will stop this car
and come back there

12:27.330 --> 12:29.542
and then you'll be in
a world of trouble!

12:29.625 --> 12:32.628
(children grunting)

12:32.712 --> 12:33.462
- Perfect.

12:35.422 --> 12:37.340
Okay, just start the
fire and we're done.

12:37.423 --> 12:40.468
(light gentle music)

12:42.888 --> 12:45.598
(fire crackling)

12:58.028 --> 12:58.862
- Dad! Dad!

13:00.572 --> 13:01.865
Dad!

13:01.948 --> 13:04.117
- Oh no! Dave!

13:04.202 --> 13:05.285
David! David!

13:07.747 --> 13:08.872
- Yeah, What?

13:08.955 --> 13:10.790
- [Sandy] You forgot
to open the flue!

13:12.668 --> 13:13.835
- What?

13:13.918 --> 13:16.255
- [Sandy] You forgot
to open the flue!

13:16.338 --> 13:18.257
(fire crackling)

13:18.340 --> 13:19.633
(relatives chattering
indistinctly)

13:19.717 --> 13:21.218
- Get in with me.
Go ahead, girls.

13:21.302 --> 13:23.553
Okay, go ahead, girls. Okay.

13:23.637 --> 13:24.555
Hello, hello!

13:24.638 --> 13:27.432
(children cheering)

13:27.517 --> 13:28.683
- [Sandy] How was your trip?

13:28.767 --> 13:30.310
- Oh awful, seven
hours and 20 minutes.

13:30.393 --> 13:32.103
That's the longest trip ever.

13:32.187 --> 13:34.690
(relatives chattering)

13:34.773 --> 13:36.775
- Are you okay?
- No, we're not hungry!

13:36.858 --> 13:37.902
- What do you mean
we're not hungry?

13:37.985 --> 13:39.528
You can't tell me
when I'm not hungry.

13:39.612 --> 13:40.905
- I'm hungry!

13:40.988 --> 13:41.822
- I don't care, I don't
want you in that kitchen.

13:41.905 --> 13:42.990
They have enough to do in there.

13:43.073 --> 13:44.742
- What kind of
toilet paper you got?

13:44.825 --> 13:46.493
- Glad to see you.
- Hi!

13:46.577 --> 13:47.410
- So good to see you.

13:47.493 --> 13:48.787
- Now, this is my orange soda.

13:48.870 --> 13:50.580
I brought one for every day.

13:50.663 --> 13:51.665
Look, got at my name on it,

13:51.748 --> 13:53.333
DM, Daryl McCormick.

13:54.668 --> 13:55.752
Okay, my name's on it.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.672
- I ain't taking off my
shoes, my feet get cold.

13:57.755 --> 14:00.423
- I brought my footed pajamas.

14:00.507 --> 14:03.468
- I can't work with those
single-ply nonsense.

14:04.678 --> 14:06.388
- What kind of grown man
wears footie pajamas?

14:06.472 --> 14:08.515
- I like to be
comfortable, okay, Matt?

14:09.475 --> 14:11.560
- [Woman] Okay.

14:11.643 --> 14:12.393
Hi!

14:13.645 --> 14:14.813
- We're not handing out
free presents this year.

14:14.897 --> 14:16.857
- Oh no, I'm not-
- Remember?

14:16.940 --> 14:19.818
- Taking my shoes off, not,
this isn't Communist China.

14:20.987 --> 14:23.780
Okay, come on, men,
let's storm the kitchen!

14:24.657 --> 14:27.033
- Hey, uh, do me a favor.

14:27.117 --> 14:28.410
Keys are in the jacket.

14:28.493 --> 14:30.787
Go get my luggage,
would you? Bad back.

14:32.163 --> 14:32.957
- Okay.

14:34.375 --> 14:37.293
- (sighing) Merry
Christmas, Mister Madison.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.087
- Merry Christmas,
Missus Madison.

14:42.090 --> 14:46.303
("We Wish You a
Merry Christmas")

15:02.695 --> 15:04.947
- [Matt] So how are
you Mister Madison?

15:06.157 --> 15:07.742
- Well, I'm still alive.

15:14.332 --> 15:16.542
Oh, enough of this small talk.

15:16.625 --> 15:17.752
Let's turn on the TV.

15:20.712 --> 15:21.588
- Hey, Dad.

15:21.672 --> 15:22.673
- [Daryl] Yeah.

15:22.757 --> 15:24.883
- Isn't it true that
Santa Claus is real?

15:24.967 --> 15:26.760
- Of course he's real.

15:26.843 --> 15:28.887
- See, told you.

15:33.392 --> 15:34.727
- I really don't think
that making a batch

15:34.810 --> 15:36.395
or two of cookies
is gonna hurt us.

15:36.478 --> 15:38.688
- Cookies can be very harmful.

15:39.857 --> 15:41.317
- I'll tell you what.

15:41.400 --> 15:42.735
We'll go to the gym on
December 26th and burn it off.

15:42.818 --> 15:44.027
What do you say?

15:44.110 --> 15:45.903
- It's not just
the calories, Mom.

15:45.988 --> 15:47.197
There's also the
long term effects

15:47.280 --> 15:48.865
of over-exposure to sugar,

15:48.948 --> 15:51.285
which can change your
insulin sensitivity

15:51.368 --> 15:53.787
and you could get diabetes.

15:53.870 --> 15:56.582
- I don't think we're in
any real danger of that.

15:56.665 --> 15:57.750
- Well, maybe not.

15:57.833 --> 15:59.918
But it can also cause
tooth decay, anxiety,

16:00.002 --> 16:02.797
and a depressed feeling after
you crash from a sugar high.

16:02.880 --> 16:04.923
No, thank you.

16:05.007 --> 16:07.133
- Kassandra, come
on, he's doing it!

16:07.217 --> 16:08.718
- Gotta go, Mom.

16:08.802 --> 16:10.303
Brandon's gonna prove
that Santa Claus is real.

16:11.347 --> 16:12.347
- Have fun!

16:14.307 --> 16:15.725
- Here's part one
of my experiments

16:15.808 --> 16:17.770
to prove that Santa
Claus is real.

16:17.853 --> 16:18.770
All right, I want you
guys to wait out here

16:18.853 --> 16:20.438
and witness me going
into the house.

16:20.522 --> 16:21.732
Everyone else is already inside.

16:21.815 --> 16:25.902
(light playful music)

16:25.985 --> 16:27.403
- [Child In Red Cap]
What's that for?

16:27.487 --> 16:28.738
- In case I get I get
stuck in the chimney,

16:28.822 --> 16:29.907
my brothers can pull me out.

16:29.990 --> 16:31.908
- Ah, smart.

16:33.993 --> 16:34.870
- Here we go.

16:43.545 --> 16:44.838
- What's that for?

16:44.922 --> 16:46.173
- Brandon tied it
around his waist

16:46.257 --> 16:48.175
so if he gets stuck
we can pull him down.

16:48.258 --> 16:50.593
- Ah, smart!

16:50.677 --> 16:51.928
- Brandon's no dummy.

16:54.848 --> 16:56.433
- Come on Brandon,
you can do it.

16:59.102 --> 17:00.103
- I'm stuck!

17:00.187 --> 17:01.020
Help, help!

17:02.522 --> 17:04.775
Help, I'm stuck, help, help!

17:04.858 --> 17:06.277
Help!
- Guys, pull!

17:06.359 --> 17:09.112
(Brandon yelling)

17:18.913 --> 17:19.707
- Cookies!

17:25.045 --> 17:26.045
- Cookies are ready.

17:26.838 --> 17:28.423
- Well, what about Brandon?

17:28.507 --> 17:29.633
- [Child Without A Hat] If
we don't get there fast,

17:29.717 --> 17:30.883
Dad and Uncle
Ben'll eat them all.

17:38.475 --> 17:42.062
- [Daryl] Mm, cookies.
We'll see about that.

17:42.938 --> 17:45.148
- Um, where's Brandon?

17:48.068 --> 17:49.318
- [Ben] Ooh!

17:49.402 --> 17:52.155
- Uh, kids, have you
seen your cousin Brandon?

17:52.238 --> 17:55.325
(light gentle music)

18:15.803 --> 18:16.555
(Brandon yelling)

18:16.638 --> 18:18.307
(Matt yelling)

18:18.390 --> 18:21.518
(ornaments tinkling)

18:21.602 --> 18:22.352
- Brandon!

18:24.270 --> 18:25.772
(sirens wailing)

18:25.855 --> 18:29.025
(gentle upbeat music)

18:39.703 --> 18:41.037
- Well, I hope you
guys are happy.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.998
You could've killed Brandon!

18:43.082 --> 18:44.165
Go inside, all of you.

18:45.375 --> 18:46.710
And no cookies!

18:49.630 --> 18:52.883
- I see your children
are misbehaving again.

18:52.967 --> 18:54.802
- He's just a boy, Wesley.

18:56.135 --> 18:59.557
- A halfwit boy who's gonna
grow up to be a halfwit man.

18:59.640 --> 19:02.100
A lump of coal and
a good spanking,

19:02.183 --> 19:04.937
that's what you'd get
for Christmas were
I were your father.

19:05.020 --> 19:07.438
I'd be doing you
a favor, too, boy.

19:14.028 --> 19:16.072
- Basement, shower, go.

19:17.198 --> 19:19.325
And don't touch anything
on your way down.

19:21.578 --> 19:22.328
Dave!

19:24.748 --> 19:25.540
Dave!

19:30.045 --> 19:30.962
Have you seen Dave?

19:31.045 --> 19:32.213
- [Man] Where? All right.

19:32.297 --> 19:33.757
- Think he's around
here somewhere.

19:36.008 --> 19:40.138
- Oh, oh, Mister
Madison, your shoes.

19:40.222 --> 19:41.723
- Just a little coffee please.

19:47.270 --> 19:48.272
- Dave!

19:50.898 --> 19:51.650
Dave?

19:51.733 --> 19:53.193
- Huh, huh?

19:53.277 --> 19:54.570
What's going on?

19:54.653 --> 19:55.695
- What are you doing?

19:57.447 --> 19:58.532
- I cut a hole on the floor

19:58.615 --> 20:00.492
so I could go ice fishing.

20:00.575 --> 20:01.702
What does it look
like I'm doing?

20:01.785 --> 20:02.577
I'm taking a nap.

20:02.660 --> 20:03.412
- Why?

20:04.537 --> 20:06.122
- Because I'm tired, Sandy.

20:06.205 --> 20:07.082
- What do you have
to be tired about?

20:07.165 --> 20:08.750
I spent all morning cooking.

20:08.833 --> 20:10.043
I've been following your father

20:10.127 --> 20:11.670
and his melting shoes
around the house with a mop.

20:11.753 --> 20:13.130
And I just helped
the fire department

20:13.213 --> 20:14.923
fish Brandon out of the chimney.

20:15.007 --> 20:16.342
- Chimney?

20:16.425 --> 20:18.093
- Now I need you to
shovel the driveway.

20:18.177 --> 20:19.010
- Why?
- Because

20:19.093 --> 20:20.095
there's snow on it, David.

20:20.178 --> 20:21.053
- And?

20:21.137 --> 20:23.057
- And everybody's parked
out on the street,

20:23.140 --> 20:24.725
and we have a
perfectly big driveway.

20:24.808 --> 20:26.017
And if you just shovel it,

20:26.100 --> 20:27.810
then everybody can put
in to the driveway.

20:27.893 --> 20:29.187
- What do you care
if people are parked

20:29.270 --> 20:31.357
in the street or the driveway?

20:31.440 --> 20:32.773
- Get out of that bed!

20:33.900 --> 20:35.360
- Fine!

20:35.443 --> 20:36.152
Fine!

20:45.370 --> 20:47.455
(gentle light music)

20:47.538 --> 20:48.248
- Hey!

20:49.165 --> 20:50.167
Hey!

20:56.172 --> 20:58.175
Hey, how much for the driveway?

20:59.508 --> 21:00.927
- 50 bucks.

21:01.010 --> 21:03.138
- Ah, come on that's a little...

21:03.222 --> 21:04.682
All right.

21:04.765 --> 21:06.350
- You want the walk done, too?

21:06.433 --> 21:10.353
- Well, yeah, the walk,
the porch, the driveway,

21:10.437 --> 21:12.188
the whole thing.

21:12.272 --> 21:13.107
- 60.

21:13.190 --> 21:14.107
- Ah, come on.

21:15.067 --> 21:16.402
- Come on, boys, lets go.

21:16.485 --> 21:17.277
- All right, fine.

21:17.360 --> 21:18.445
60 bucks.

21:19.780 --> 21:22.323
- All right, get to
work, come on, go. Here.

21:26.202 --> 21:27.287
- Oh, you know what?

21:27.370 --> 21:28.622
My neighbor's pushing 80.

21:29.748 --> 21:30.915
So do his for me, too.

21:31.750 --> 21:32.625
- Okay.

21:32.708 --> 21:33.918
- I mean, hey.

21:34.002 --> 21:34.585
It's the big guy's
birthday, right?

21:36.212 --> 21:37.213
- What is it?

21:38.215 --> 21:39.007
- Christmas.

21:40.008 --> 21:41.885
- Oh, Merry Christmas.

21:41.968 --> 21:44.847
- This one and the
one next door, okay.

21:44.930 --> 21:45.638
- Okay.

21:48.183 --> 21:51.478
- Oh, and, uh, hey, don't ring
the bell when you're done.

21:51.562 --> 21:53.438
I'll be watching
and I'll come out.

21:53.522 --> 21:55.190
- [Earl] Okay.

21:55.273 --> 21:58.152
Hey, come on slackers,
get your back into it.

22:00.112 --> 22:02.238
Go ahead and throw a whole
shovelful on your brother.

22:03.323 --> 22:06.535
(bright lively music)

22:09.578 --> 22:11.498
- [Carol] You need to
add 3/4 cup of sugar

22:11.582 --> 22:13.500
and a pinch of ginger.

22:13.583 --> 22:15.752
- [Rachel] No, you only need
1/2 a cup of brown sugar

22:15.835 --> 22:19.547
and a dash, not a pinch,
a dash of cinnamon.

22:19.630 --> 22:21.173
- Attention!

22:21.257 --> 22:22.592
Attention!

22:22.675 --> 22:24.510
In five minutes, we
will finally be done

22:24.593 --> 22:26.345
baking cookies for the year.

22:28.682 --> 22:29.473
- Psst.

22:30.392 --> 22:31.183
Psst!

22:32.560 --> 22:34.103
- Dave, what are
you doing, buddy?

22:34.187 --> 22:34.897
- Hey!

22:34.980 --> 22:36.523
- Shut up, shut up!

22:36.607 --> 22:38.067
I need your room.

22:38.150 --> 22:40.068
- My room? What for?

22:40.152 --> 22:42.153
- Stop asking questions.

22:42.237 --> 22:45.948
Just keep Carol busy for about
an hour so I can take a nap.

22:46.032 --> 22:47.325
- I don't no.

22:47.408 --> 22:49.452
Sounds like we'll
get in trouble.

22:49.535 --> 22:51.497
- Yeah, What's in it for us?

22:53.332 --> 22:55.083
- How about a free
home, free food,

22:55.167 --> 22:57.127
and use of my big screen TV?

23:00.130 --> 23:01.255
- Nah, I already got that.

23:01.338 --> 23:02.840
- Yeah.

23:02.923 --> 23:06.720
- Fine, Christmas dinner,
you can have the turkey legs.

23:06.803 --> 23:09.430
It's my house, but you
can have the drumsticks.

23:14.393 --> 23:15.812
- Deal.

23:15.895 --> 23:17.188
- Oh, we'll cover you.

23:17.272 --> 23:18.273
- All right.

23:18.357 --> 23:20.275
- We'll go right now.

23:23.112 --> 23:23.862
- These hot?

23:23.945 --> 23:25.405
- Hey, no touching.

23:26.573 --> 23:27.657
- What are you doing?

23:27.740 --> 23:28.617
- I'm starving.

23:28.700 --> 23:29.408
- Daryl, get out.

23:29.492 --> 23:30.785
- Matt, not now.

23:30.868 --> 23:32.245
No, no!

23:32.328 --> 23:33.705
- Matt, take it off.

23:33.788 --> 23:35.332
- I'm hungry.

23:35.415 --> 23:37.292
Hey wait, that's for
Christmas dinner.

23:37.375 --> 23:38.793
- I said go!

23:38.877 --> 23:40.378
- I just never seen
you in the kitchen.

23:40.462 --> 23:41.295
- Get out of here.

23:42.380 --> 23:43.548
- Go away.

23:43.632 --> 23:44.382
- Just go!

24:05.987 --> 24:07.280
- It can't be done,

24:07.363 --> 24:09.032
you'd have to have a
super human stomach.

24:09.115 --> 24:10.325
- Of course it can.

24:10.408 --> 24:11.702
What about that
little Chinese guy

24:11.785 --> 24:12.952
that eats all the hot dogs?

24:13.035 --> 24:13.870
- That's true.

24:13.953 --> 24:15.330
My dad and me saw it on TV.

24:15.413 --> 24:18.750
He ate 68 hot dogs
in only ten minutes.

24:18.833 --> 24:21.335
- Yeah see, that's
just in ten minutes.

24:21.418 --> 24:23.422
Santa has all night
to eat cookies.

24:24.338 --> 24:25.882
- That's it, that's
the last batch.

24:25.965 --> 24:28.385
We are finally and officially
done baking cookies.

24:28.468 --> 24:30.178
- Yeah.

24:30.262 --> 24:32.430
- Well, even if he ate
one cookie at every house,

24:32.513 --> 24:35.308
it would still be like
thousands of cookies.

24:35.392 --> 24:37.602
- Okay, I'll prove it to you.

24:37.685 --> 24:39.145
Bring me all the
cookies in the house,

24:39.228 --> 24:40.313
and a big glass of milk.

25:47.463 --> 25:49.340
- Ooh, it must be good.

25:51.383 --> 25:52.468
Driveway's all shoveled.

25:52.552 --> 25:53.387
- Thank you, dear.

26:01.102 --> 26:03.313
Okay everybody, cars
in the driveway please.

26:03.397 --> 26:05.398
Matt, Daryl, come on move it.

26:05.482 --> 26:07.108
Hey Ben, hear me over there.

26:07.192 --> 26:09.027
Let's go, cars in
the driveway please.

26:10.445 --> 26:12.988
Mister Madison, would you like
me to move your car for you?

26:13.072 --> 26:14.782
- I'll drive my own darn car.

26:20.747 --> 26:21.873
- Hey guys.

26:21.957 --> 26:25.293
Okay, that's a $120 I owe you.

26:26.502 --> 26:28.045
- Let's see, it's
$60 for this house.

26:28.128 --> 26:30.173
$60 for your house, that's uh,

26:33.050 --> 26:34.970
you have a pen and
a piece of paper?

26:35.053 --> 26:36.345
- No, I don't.

26:36.428 --> 26:37.430
But it's a 120.

26:38.765 --> 26:42.102
- Or you could just
give me $60 twice.

26:42.185 --> 26:44.103
- I could, that's true.

26:44.187 --> 26:45.522
But I'd rather not
write two checks.

26:45.605 --> 26:47.232
- Oh no no no checks.

26:47.315 --> 26:47.982
- Excuse me?

26:48.065 --> 26:48.817
- Cash only.

26:50.402 --> 26:52.778
I don't have $120 in cash on me.

26:52.862 --> 26:55.115
- You got $60, twice?

26:56.783 --> 26:59.368
- Look, we're not gypsies.

26:59.452 --> 27:01.663
Our house isn't going anywhere.

27:01.747 --> 27:03.415
I'm not gonna write
you a bad check.

27:03.498 --> 27:04.748
- Cash only.

27:06.042 --> 27:08.168
You gonna have to go
to one of those ATMs.

27:11.380 --> 27:13.550
- Look, my car is in the garage.

27:13.633 --> 27:15.052
I'm backed in.

27:15.135 --> 27:16.302
- Okay.

27:16.385 --> 27:17.053
- Thank you.

27:17.137 --> 27:17.845
- We'll take my car.

27:17.928 --> 27:19.430
Come on boys, let's go.

27:19.513 --> 27:20.265
Move it.

27:22.642 --> 27:26.062
All right kids, load it up
we're going to the bank.

27:28.898 --> 27:31.693
(doors squeaking)

27:39.575 --> 27:42.078
(van starting)

27:47.000 --> 27:47.875
You go to college?

27:47.958 --> 27:49.460
- University of Michigan.

27:49.543 --> 27:50.920
- Waste of time.

27:51.003 --> 27:52.547
They don't teach you
anything but socialism there.

27:52.630 --> 27:53.590
I'm Earl.

27:53.673 --> 27:54.673
- Dave.

27:55.883 --> 27:57.468
- Hey Dave, you look
like a real smart fellow.

27:57.552 --> 27:59.428
- Well, I appreciate that.

27:59.512 --> 28:00.680
- I might just
have an opportunity

28:00.763 --> 28:02.890
for you to make some real money.

28:04.058 --> 28:07.020
My half brother,
he's also my cousin,

28:07.103 --> 28:09.980
he's into that
multilevel marketing.

28:10.065 --> 28:12.025
I'd like to get the two
of you guys together.

28:12.108 --> 28:13.485
In a room, together.

28:14.360 --> 28:16.738
(polka music)

28:29.292 --> 28:30.585
- How does this thing work?

28:30.668 --> 28:31.878
I always go inside.

28:33.295 --> 28:34.547
- You put in your PIN.

28:34.630 --> 28:37.717
- PIN? I don't know my PIN.

28:37.800 --> 28:38.635
- You just type it in.

28:38.718 --> 28:40.052
- I don't know what it is.

28:43.515 --> 28:44.848
- Why don't you call your wife?

28:46.142 --> 28:48.603
- There's no way I could
possibly explain this.

28:50.688 --> 28:53.483
Look, will you
just take a check?

28:53.567 --> 28:55.735
- No, no, I can't take a check.

28:57.028 --> 28:58.988
I'll tell you what,
me and the boys here,

28:59.072 --> 29:00.573
we need some groceries.

29:00.657 --> 29:03.743
Why don't we hop back in
the van, we'll go shopping.

29:04.952 --> 29:05.870
You can pay for it.

29:09.082 --> 29:10.292
- Fine.

29:10.375 --> 29:11.625
- Okay, come on boys.

29:25.640 --> 29:27.058
- Where are you going?

29:27.142 --> 29:28.058
- Grocery store.

29:28.142 --> 29:29.768
- Grocery store's over there.

29:29.852 --> 29:31.562
- Yeah I like the
9th Bridge Market.

29:32.688 --> 29:33.690
- Where is that?

29:33.773 --> 29:34.690
- Across town.

29:34.773 --> 29:36.608
Won't take more
than 20-25 minutes.

29:37.485 --> 29:38.277
- Oh, good.

29:41.697 --> 29:42.490
- Brandon!

29:44.742 --> 29:45.702
What happened to him?

29:46.702 --> 29:49.705
Well, somebody knows, speak.

30:18.693 --> 30:20.778
- Look at these hot
dogs, they all beef?

30:20.862 --> 30:23.155
- I don't know, I
don't work here.

30:23.238 --> 30:25.157
- How much longer are
we going to be here?

30:25.242 --> 30:27.243
- We're gonna be here
till we're done shopping.

30:28.703 --> 30:30.872
Now why don't you go run around
get something to eat? Go.

30:32.373 --> 30:34.625
I wonder if these are all beef.

30:34.708 --> 30:37.253
You know, this place used
to be beer and bait shop?

30:37.337 --> 30:40.632
Now it's all fancy
shnancy pantsy.

30:40.715 --> 30:42.633
Maybe we oughta go back to the
store you were talking about.

30:42.717 --> 30:44.677
- We're not going to
another market, Earl.

30:44.760 --> 30:46.137
You wanted to come here.

30:46.220 --> 30:47.472
We're here.

30:47.555 --> 30:48.723
- All right, all
right, all right.

30:48.807 --> 30:49.557
You mind pushing?

30:55.145 --> 30:57.648
What in the world
is a Swedish fish?

30:58.692 --> 31:00.360
You have big plans
for Christmas day?

31:00.443 --> 31:02.903
Earl, your kids are eating
candy and drinking soda.

31:02.987 --> 31:05.448
- Yeah, I know, I'd suppose
I oughta feel guilty.

31:05.532 --> 31:06.782
- Or may be stop them?

31:06.865 --> 31:08.242
- [Earl] But it's Christmas!

31:08.325 --> 31:10.745
They wanna get all hopped
up on sugar one time a year,

31:10.828 --> 31:12.538
it's okay by me, you want
them to bring you a chocolate?

31:12.622 --> 31:13.707
- No, thank you.

31:13.790 --> 31:14.498
- Soda?

31:14.582 --> 31:15.333
- Am all set, Earl!

31:16.333 --> 31:18.335
I think we're at the 120.

31:18.418 --> 31:19.253
None for me either,

31:19.337 --> 31:20.797
I'm on the Atkins diet now.

31:21.588 --> 31:22.798
All protein, baby.

31:24.675 --> 31:27.762
- 137 dollars and 28 cents.

31:27.845 --> 31:29.347
- You got $17.

31:31.098 --> 31:32.558
- Let's just call it gas money.

31:32.642 --> 31:34.185
- Gas money?

31:34.268 --> 31:35.102
- What, I drove.

31:36.603 --> 31:37.772
Hey, do you know if those
hot dogs are all beef?

31:37.855 --> 31:39.065
- Don't answer that question,

31:39.148 --> 31:40.858
just put it in the
bag, we'll take 'em.

31:41.858 --> 31:42.902
Thank you.

31:43.778 --> 31:44.737
There you go.

31:46.780 --> 31:48.825
Here you go 137 and 28 cents.

31:52.412 --> 31:55.038
(siren blaring)

31:58.458 --> 31:59.335
- [Sandy] Where have you been?

31:59.418 --> 32:00.295
- I was just-

32:00.378 --> 32:01.878
- Brandon ate all the cookies.

32:01.963 --> 32:03.505
Six batches, every
single one of them.

32:03.588 --> 32:04.798
- Six batches?

32:04.882 --> 32:06.217
- Yeah, they just took
him to the hospital.

32:06.300 --> 32:07.135
Carol went with him.

32:07.218 --> 32:09.387
You know I was yelling for you,

32:09.470 --> 32:10.805
Dave? Dave?

32:10.888 --> 32:11.722
But of course,

32:11.805 --> 32:12.890
you were nowhere to be found.

32:12.973 --> 32:14.017
- Well, I was just-

32:14.100 --> 32:15.183
- Well, you were what?

32:16.685 --> 32:18.938
- I was just shoveling
Mister Nicolas' driveway.

32:19.855 --> 32:21.815
You know, he's almost 80.

32:21.898 --> 32:22.900
It's the holidays.

32:22.983 --> 32:23.818
- Oh, honey.

32:23.902 --> 32:25.027
- So I figured why not help him?

32:25.110 --> 32:27.738
- Sweetie, that
is so nice of you.

32:27.822 --> 32:30.240
Oh honey, I'm sorry, sorry.

32:32.410 --> 32:34.912
I'm gonna have to make
some more cookies, now.

32:34.995 --> 32:35.830
Oh, you know what?

32:35.913 --> 32:37.207
Here's the list of ingredients.

32:37.290 --> 32:39.833
I'm gonna need you to go to
the 9th Bridge Market for me.

32:39.917 --> 32:40.918
Thanks.

32:50.135 --> 32:52.847
- Ah, Merry Christmas.

32:52.930 --> 32:54.307
- Merry Christmas.

32:54.390 --> 32:55.933
- Oh, you got me.

32:56.017 --> 32:57.602
Boy, your quiet.

32:57.685 --> 32:59.812
Don't let Missus Claus
find out about this.

32:59.895 --> 33:01.897
Now, where were we?

33:01.980 --> 33:03.648
Oh, yes, yes.

33:03.733 --> 33:05.485
Between them, the
Rockford Fire Department

33:05.568 --> 33:07.987
having to rescue Brandon
from the chimney,

33:08.070 --> 33:11.490
and Dave being dragged
all over town by Earl?

33:11.573 --> 33:14.743
Well, the Madison
family's had quite a day.

33:14.827 --> 33:15.745
Let's see what kind of mischief

33:15.828 --> 33:17.872
they get into on
the 23rd, shall we?

33:18.915 --> 33:21.208
- I will now prove to
you that it is possible,

33:21.292 --> 33:25.045
given enough speed and reindeer
power, to make a sled fly.

33:26.297 --> 33:30.008
(dramatic orchestral music)

33:38.058 --> 33:40.978
- Dave, are you
watching the kids?

33:41.937 --> 33:43.230
- Dave's fixing the toilet.

33:45.983 --> 33:49.945
(dramatic orchestral music)

34:00.038 --> 34:01.915
- Hike, come on hike,

34:01.998 --> 34:03.083
go, go, go.

34:03.167 --> 34:06.670
(tense orchestral music)

34:14.803 --> 34:17.013
(yelling)

34:17.806 --> 34:21.018
(children chattering)

34:25.940 --> 34:28.608
(siren blaring)

34:32.155 --> 34:33.822
- Oh my gosh, Brandon.

34:36.824 --> 34:37.618
Thank you.

34:44.917 --> 34:46.293
- Hey, what are you doing?

34:48.295 --> 34:49.380
- Dave.

34:49.463 --> 34:51.047
- Why are you in my kitchen?

34:51.132 --> 34:51.840
- Your kitchen?

34:51.922 --> 34:53.007
This is my house.

34:53.092 --> 34:53.927
- What do you want, Dave?

34:54.010 --> 34:55.052
No, that food is for dinner.

34:55.135 --> 34:56.637
- Dave, we're busy.

34:56.719 --> 34:58.138
- Which of this
food is for lunch?

34:58.222 --> 34:59.765
(talking over each other)

34:59.848 --> 35:01.017
What is this, Yom Kippur,

35:01.100 --> 35:02.893
am I supposed to
fast until sundown?

35:02.977 --> 35:04.812
- Get out of the kitchen.

35:04.895 --> 35:05.647
You are making a mess.

35:05.730 --> 35:06.938
- Go!

35:07.022 --> 35:10.192
- It's supposed to be
for everyone, Dave.

35:11.693 --> 35:14.405
- Dad, I'm going out for
some lunch, You wanna come?

35:14.488 --> 35:16.365
- No, the girls fixed
me a little soup.

35:18.117 --> 35:18.910
- What?

35:19.993 --> 35:21.037
You made dad soup?

35:21.120 --> 35:23.080
- [Woman] Stay out
of the kitchen, Dave.

35:23.998 --> 35:24.998
- Fine!

35:31.005 --> 35:34.092
(lighthearted music)

35:43.017 --> 35:48.022
- Hey, Uncle Dave, get him!

35:48.940 --> 35:51.442
- [Child] Give me some.

35:51.525 --> 35:53.110
- You better run.

35:58.573 --> 36:00.367
- Grandpa Madison?

36:00.450 --> 36:01.660
- Oh, hi Kassandra.

36:02.870 --> 36:05.497
Grandpa Madison, do
you believe in Santa?

36:06.373 --> 36:08.042
- Of course I do.

36:08.125 --> 36:09.793
- What about for bad children?

36:11.712 --> 36:14.048
- Let me tell you a
little secret, Kassandra.

36:14.132 --> 36:15.257
There are no bad children.

36:18.260 --> 36:21.013
- What if I mailed this
letter to Santa today?

36:21.097 --> 36:22.598
Do you think he'd
get it on time?

36:23.473 --> 36:25.017
- No, I don't think he would.

36:26.060 --> 36:28.938
- Oh, okay, thanks Grandpa.

36:29.022 --> 36:33.275
- However, if you
gave me the letter,

36:33.358 --> 36:35.653
I might be able to give
it to him personally.

36:37.863 --> 36:40.992
You see, when you live
as long as I have,

36:41.075 --> 36:43.285
you know am awful lot
of important people.

36:44.120 --> 36:45.078
- Really?

36:45.162 --> 36:46.163
- Yeah.

36:47.332 --> 36:48.498
- Thanks, Grandpa.

36:48.582 --> 36:53.545
- All right.

37:03.055 --> 37:05.140
All right, you two,
up, out of here,

37:05.223 --> 37:07.518
get your cars, you
got me parked in.

37:07.602 --> 37:09.187
- Where you going
Mister Madison?

37:09.270 --> 37:12.147
- To a place where people
mind their own darn business.

37:14.233 --> 37:15.233
- I think we're okay here, dad.

37:15.317 --> 37:17.278
I mean we got the TV
on, we got snacks,

37:17.362 --> 37:19.030
and we're wearing slippers.

37:19.113 --> 37:22.073
- All right, long hair
fat boy, out of here.

37:22.157 --> 37:25.202
- Mister Madison, hey my car
is at the end of the driveway.

37:25.285 --> 37:26.537
Why don't you borrow mine?

37:26.620 --> 37:28.622
- I'm not driving any
little foreign pansy car.

37:28.705 --> 37:31.042
I drive a Cadillac
like a real man.

37:31.125 --> 37:34.712
All right, this conversation
is over, out of here.

37:34.795 --> 37:35.545
- Yeah.

37:37.423 --> 37:38.215
- Nope.

37:50.518 --> 37:51.353
"Dear Santa,

37:52.855 --> 37:57.360
all I want for Christmas and
my birthday this year is a dog.

37:58.568 --> 38:00.153
Well, I would also
like peace on earth

38:00.237 --> 38:02.365
and good health
to all my family,

38:02.448 --> 38:06.118
including Grandpa
Madison, who is old,

38:06.202 --> 38:09.455
and my Grandma,
who I loved, died.

38:09.538 --> 38:11.957
But I also really want a dog.

38:12.040 --> 38:14.252
I don't even care what kind.

38:14.335 --> 38:15.670
I would be nice to it,

38:15.753 --> 38:18.130
and take it on lots of walks.

38:18.213 --> 38:19.507
I promise.

38:19.590 --> 38:22.133
I don't even need any
other toys or anything.

38:22.217 --> 38:24.178
Love, Kassandra.

38:24.262 --> 38:28.307
PS, I have been very,
very good this year."

38:31.685 --> 38:33.187
Okay, okay Kassandra.

38:35.982 --> 38:38.358
(Asian music)

38:40.152 --> 38:42.738
(crowd talking)

39:05.260 --> 39:07.597
- Geez, it's like the
OK Corral in here.

39:07.680 --> 39:11.017
- Yup, been in line 45 minutes.

39:11.100 --> 39:12.100
What you're gonna do?

39:12.183 --> 39:13.893
It's Christmas, it's
the only place open.

39:16.230 --> 39:18.315
(sneezing)

39:19.483 --> 39:22.110
(light music)

39:33.247 --> 39:34.498
- How many your party?

39:34.582 --> 39:35.332
- One.

39:35.415 --> 39:36.625
- No, one, sorry.

39:36.708 --> 39:38.252
You come back new year.

39:38.335 --> 39:39.545
- Excuse me?

39:39.628 --> 39:40.462
- It's too busy,

39:40.545 --> 39:42.172
three or four people table.

39:42.255 --> 39:43.882
- Well, there's a little
piece of information

39:43.965 --> 39:45.550
I could have used
about an hour ago.

39:45.633 --> 39:46.343
- Next please.

39:46.427 --> 39:47.135
- No, next please.

39:47.218 --> 39:48.553
I want a table.

39:51.682 --> 39:53.183
- We'll sit with you.

39:53.267 --> 39:55.770
- Yeah, me and Fred here.

39:56.895 --> 39:58.813
Fred's my man.

39:58.897 --> 40:01.358
We'll all sit
together, it'll be fun.

40:01.442 --> 40:02.192
- Come on.

40:03.360 --> 40:04.403
- Okay.

40:07.990 --> 40:10.200
- Oh, little nip?

40:11.410 --> 40:12.453
- No, I don't.

40:12.537 --> 40:13.287
Thank you though.

40:15.538 --> 40:17.500
- Fred and I just
met on Tuesday.

40:18.958 --> 40:19.710
- [Dave] Okay.

40:23.088 --> 40:25.257
- Yeah, we're living together.

40:28.385 --> 40:29.387
- All right.

40:31.305 --> 40:32.807
- So what do you
think about that?

40:32.890 --> 40:35.308
- Well, it's truly none of my,

40:37.937 --> 40:42.900
look, you two are adults,
you do what you like.

40:44.402 --> 40:45.735
- Come on.

40:45.820 --> 40:47.362
Stop being so shy.

40:47.445 --> 40:48.572
He's so shy.

40:49.657 --> 40:50.407
- Well, okay.

40:52.702 --> 40:55.037
You say that you're
living together.

40:55.120 --> 40:56.330
What do you mean?

40:56.413 --> 40:57.790
You're living together
in the same house?

40:57.873 --> 41:00.292
Or do you mean, you're living
together in the same room?

41:00.375 --> 41:01.585
Bed, et cetera.

41:02.795 --> 41:03.545
- Hey now, you know what?

41:03.628 --> 41:05.172
Shame on you.

41:05.255 --> 41:06.257
- Excuse me?

41:06.340 --> 41:07.340
- Yeah, it's not something

41:07.423 --> 41:09.133
you ask a lady at
the dinner table.

41:09.218 --> 41:11.387
- Well, may we should not
talk about any of this.

41:11.470 --> 41:12.680
- You know what,
maybe we should.

41:12.763 --> 41:14.348
Why don't you guys
discuss it all evening.

41:14.432 --> 41:15.892
So I can finish
my plate of food.

41:15.975 --> 41:17.183
You know what, my
night's ruined.

41:17.267 --> 41:18.018
Thanks.

41:26.193 --> 41:26.985
- You know,

41:28.528 --> 41:30.113
just between you and me,

41:31.282 --> 41:33.575
I'm really glad you're
here to see that.

41:35.118 --> 41:38.663
'Cause I think he's way more
into me than I'm into him.

41:42.458 --> 41:43.835
He's just threatened by you.

41:54.722 --> 41:55.472
- Guys.

41:57.558 --> 42:01.562
I feel like, I owe
you guys an apology.

42:03.022 --> 42:05.148
I've had a lot on my mind.

42:05.232 --> 42:06.025
- No, Fred, don't.

42:06.108 --> 42:07.275
- No, it's okay, honey.

42:08.318 --> 42:12.573
We're family, and I
want you to know this.

42:14.198 --> 42:17.160
Look man, my buddy
in the war, he,

42:20.038 --> 42:21.207
he got bird flu.

42:23.000 --> 42:24.293
It's messing me up man.

42:26.795 --> 42:27.713
It's messing me up.

42:39.392 --> 42:41.393
- Oh, separate checks please.

42:41.477 --> 42:42.770
- No separate check.

42:48.525 --> 42:51.028
- Hey, I'm gonna pay for her.

42:51.112 --> 42:51.820
- Fine, whatever.

42:52.988 --> 42:56.783
- You know what hon, it's on us.

42:56.867 --> 42:57.785
It was our pleasure.

42:59.077 --> 43:00.412
- You're so sweet.

43:00.495 --> 43:02.538
Isn't he just the sweetest?

43:07.502 --> 43:10.338
- Okay then, my lunch was 5.99.

43:15.177 --> 43:18.805
Here's 20, just give me 10
back and I'll be on my way.

43:21.017 --> 43:22.517
Don't worry about
it man, like I said,

43:22.600 --> 43:23.435
I got her covered.

43:24.645 --> 43:26.480
- Yeah, however, the
two of you divided

43:26.563 --> 43:27.690
is between the two of you.

43:27.773 --> 43:29.400
Just give me 10 back.

43:31.735 --> 43:32.527
- Ah, let's see.

43:38.450 --> 43:39.452
You know what, here.

43:40.618 --> 43:42.453
There you go.

43:42.537 --> 43:44.080
- What is this?

43:44.163 --> 43:45.415
This is like two,

43:46.833 --> 43:48.293
three dollars.

43:50.420 --> 43:51.172
- Don't worry about it.

43:51.255 --> 43:52.422
I don't need any change.

43:52.505 --> 43:53.840
- It's not enough Fred.

43:55.133 --> 43:56.052
- Hey, what are you doing?

43:56.135 --> 43:57.678
No, I ate, put your purse away.

43:57.762 --> 43:59.638
Woman you're embarrassing me.

43:59.722 --> 44:01.223
I told you, we got this.

44:12.943 --> 44:15.445
(bell ringing)

44:17.072 --> 44:18.532
- Hi, Santa.

44:18.615 --> 44:19.450
- Merry Christmas.

44:20.492 --> 44:21.535
Oh, thank you.

44:23.245 --> 44:26.582
Ho ho ho, Mister Madison,
Merry Christmas sir.

44:26.665 --> 44:27.665
- I know you?

44:27.750 --> 44:28.958
- I know you.

44:29.042 --> 44:30.585
I've known you since
you were a little boy.

44:30.668 --> 44:32.253
- You don't know jack.

44:33.463 --> 44:34.548
- I see you while
you're sleeping.

44:34.632 --> 44:36.508
- What are you after, a fat lip?

44:38.052 --> 44:39.387
- Aisle seven.

44:39.470 --> 44:40.678
- What's that?

44:40.762 --> 44:42.932
- What you're looking
for, from the letter.

44:44.140 --> 44:45.600
Don't get one of
those small ones.

44:45.683 --> 44:48.478
The ankle biters, she
doesn't want that.

44:48.562 --> 44:50.647
- How do you know what?

44:52.648 --> 44:53.817
- Aisle seven, huh?

44:53.900 --> 44:55.485
- [Santa] Aisle seven.

44:55.568 --> 44:56.695
- Yeah, okay, merry.

44:56.778 --> 44:58.488
- Merry Christmas to you, sir.

44:59.322 --> 45:00.198
- Yeah, sure.

45:05.495 --> 45:06.580
(knocking on door)

45:06.663 --> 45:08.040
- Kassandra, get dressed please.

45:08.123 --> 45:09.040
- I am dressed.

45:09.123 --> 45:10.458
I'm not naked mom.

45:10.542 --> 45:12.418
- Stop reading, and put
on the dress and tights

45:12.502 --> 45:13.920
I laid out for you.

45:14.003 --> 45:15.130
- What for?

45:15.213 --> 45:16.340
- Your father's
office holiday party.

45:16.423 --> 45:18.258
- No, no, no mom, no!

45:18.342 --> 45:20.260
- Kassandra, don't start.

45:20.343 --> 45:22.470
- But I was gonna go
to the dog park today.

45:22.553 --> 45:24.557
- Well, you can go to the
dog park another time.

45:24.640 --> 45:25.640
I need you

45:25.723 --> 45:26.683
to get ready.
- I hate dad's office parties.

45:26.767 --> 45:28.060
- It's not that bad.

45:28.143 --> 45:29.478
- Yeah, but that weird old guy

45:29.562 --> 45:31.730
always talks to me
about stock profiles.

45:31.813 --> 45:34.107
- Mister Drummers talks to
everybody about his stock.

45:34.190 --> 45:35.650
You know, you wouldn't
be such an easy target

45:35.733 --> 45:37.693
if you would just get
up out of that chair.

45:37.778 --> 45:39.530
Why don't you ever play
with the other kids?

45:39.613 --> 45:41.657
- Because Kyle is just gonna
spill food on me again.

45:41.740 --> 45:42.950
I just know it.

45:43.033 --> 45:44.325
- Honey, it's not that likely

45:44.408 --> 45:46.495
it's gonna happen
two years in a row.

but the market goes up.

47:29.723 --> 47:30.890
You can't win.

47:30.973 --> 47:32.767
Some people say
buy the blue chips.

47:32.850 --> 47:33.935
But who knows?

47:35.603 --> 47:39.523
I prefer the tech
stocks, NASDAQ.

47:39.608 --> 47:41.985
Long term options,
that's the way to go.

47:42.068 --> 47:43.278
Make money if you're buying,

47:43.362 --> 47:45.197
you make money if
you're selling.

47:45.280 --> 47:48.450
Most people don't understand
the stock market like I do.

47:48.533 --> 47:50.077
But have I always been a winner?

47:50.160 --> 47:51.620
No, of course not.

48:39.710 --> 48:41.795
My lower back is killing me.

48:43.630 --> 48:44.422
Ooh.

48:46.925 --> 48:48.593
Doing one house was okay.

48:50.137 --> 48:52.097
But doing Mister Nicolas's too.

48:53.307 --> 48:55.517
That really put my back out.

48:55.600 --> 48:58.228
- Well, it was such
a nice thing to do.

48:58.312 --> 48:59.813
Now you just lay still,

48:59.897 --> 49:01.357
and let me take care of you.

49:05.568 --> 49:07.403
- Hey.
- What?

49:07.487 --> 49:09.572
- Maybe later, we could?

49:10.907 --> 49:12.950
- Mmm, maybe we could.

Who?

49:19.415 --> 49:20.750

49:20.833 --> 49:21.668
(knocking on door)

49:21.752 --> 49:23.378
Hang on, I'll be right back.

49:24.922 --> 49:25.797
- Hurry up.

49:25.880 --> 49:26.632
- Okay, I will.

49:28.883 --> 49:30.093
- Hello.

49:30.177 --> 49:31.720
- Well, hi.

49:31.803 --> 49:35.473
Dave left his gloves
in my car yesterday.

49:35.557 --> 49:36.933
- Oh, thank you.

49:38.768 --> 49:40.145
I'm sorry, do I know you?

49:40.228 --> 49:43.690
- No, no, no, Dave hired me
to shovel out your driveway

49:43.773 --> 49:45.733
and your neighbor's
driveway yesterday.

49:45.817 --> 49:46.818
- Oh, really?

49:49.278 --> 49:50.030
David!

49:56.912 --> 49:57.953
- Hi, David.

49:59.497 --> 50:02.333
Hey buddy, yeah you left your
gloves in my car yesterday.

50:04.043 --> 50:05.378
Merry Christmas!

50:05.462 --> 50:07.422
- Merry Christmas, Earl.

50:07.505 --> 50:08.382
- Couch!

50:09.507 --> 50:11.258
- The couch is
gonna hurt my back.

50:11.342 --> 50:12.093
- Good.

50:14.763 --> 50:18.058
(soft orchestral music)

50:45.627 --> 50:46.837
- It's the morning of
the 24th of December.

50:46.920 --> 50:48.172
It's a big day.

50:48.255 --> 50:50.007
So just sit back,
enjoy the story.

50:50.090 --> 50:51.633
I got a few more
hours of bell ringing

50:51.717 --> 50:53.760
then I got a lot of work to do.

50:53.843 --> 50:54.552
Ho ho ho!

51:06.063 --> 51:06.857
- Dave?

51:09.733 --> 51:10.527
Dave.

51:11.903 --> 51:13.197
- Huh?

51:13.280 --> 51:15.365
- Dave, I need you.

51:16.240 --> 51:17.783
- What?

51:17.867 --> 51:18.618
- Dave.

51:22.038 --> 51:24.958
- Oh, you are not normally
a morning type of girl.

51:27.502 --> 51:28.295
But that's okay.

51:29.170 --> 51:30.630
Let's roll with this, I'm game.

51:30.713 --> 51:33.508
- No, not that, no, Dave.

51:35.052 --> 51:36.970
Kassandra and I have some
last minute shopping to do.

51:37.053 --> 51:39.597
We need you to drive, so you
can drop us off at the door,

51:39.680 --> 51:42.100
while you circle around
forever for parking spot.

51:42.183 --> 51:43.685
We're gonna need your
help carrying things too.

51:43.768 --> 51:46.730
So come on, let's
go, out of bed.

51:46.813 --> 51:49.190
(bell ringing)

51:55.613 --> 51:56.865
- Merry Christmas.

51:56.948 --> 52:01.787
- Merry Christmas to you too.

52:06.625 --> 52:07.417
- Hi.

52:07.500 --> 52:08.752
- Merry Christmas.

52:08.835 --> 52:10.462
- Merry Christmas.

52:10.545 --> 52:12.922
I'm just waiting for
the wife and kid.

52:13.005 --> 52:15.092
- I know how that
goes. (laughing)

52:15.175 --> 52:17.927
My wife, she
volunteered me for this.

52:18.010 --> 52:19.012
- Oh yeah?

52:19.095 --> 52:20.513
- Missus Claus.

52:20.597 --> 52:21.765
Big into charities.

52:21.848 --> 52:24.517
- I tell you, I
know how that goes.

52:24.600 --> 52:25.852
How's business?

52:25.935 --> 52:27.562
- Mostly pretty good.

52:27.645 --> 52:28.980
And it's fun.

52:29.063 --> 52:30.648
You get the bell,
you get the hat.

52:30.732 --> 52:32.025
The whole nine yards.

52:32.108 --> 52:33.735
- And the kids like you.

52:33.818 --> 52:34.862
That's a plus.

52:35.778 --> 52:37.030
- Your kid doesn't like you?

52:38.823 --> 52:39.698
- She loves me.

52:41.535 --> 52:43.787
But right now she
doesn't like me.

52:43.870 --> 52:45.788
She wants a dog.

52:45.872 --> 52:46.623
- Aah.

52:48.583 --> 52:50.043
You and her mother don't?

52:51.085 --> 52:53.087
- So I have to be
the one to say no.

52:53.963 --> 52:55.632
You know how that goes?

52:55.715 --> 52:57.092
- Yes, I do.

52:59.302 --> 53:01.428
- I used to be so fun loving.

53:01.512 --> 53:02.847
I don't feel old.

53:04.057 --> 53:06.100
When did I become the
guy that has to say no?

53:07.477 --> 53:10.355
- Well. (laughing)

53:10.438 --> 53:11.898
When you were a boy,

53:11.982 --> 53:13.692
you wanted toys.

53:13.775 --> 53:15.485
But that came with a
little responsibility.

53:15.568 --> 53:18.112
You know, pick up after
yourself, that sort of thing.

53:19.155 --> 53:20.573
As you got older,

53:20.657 --> 53:22.283
you wanted a child.

53:22.367 --> 53:25.620
Bigger reward, but a
lot more responsibility.

53:27.622 --> 53:30.208
- Sounds like you
speak from experience.

53:30.292 --> 53:31.000
You have kids?

53:32.210 --> 53:34.670
- Yeah, you could
say that. (laughing)

53:34.753 --> 53:35.755
This time of the year pal,

53:35.838 --> 53:37.840
boy my responsibilities,
I tell you.

53:37.923 --> 53:40.093
- Yeah, the holidays
can be rough.

53:40.177 --> 53:41.343
- [Santa] Yes, they can.

53:43.220 --> 53:44.013
- I'm Dave.

53:45.098 --> 53:46.140
- Kris.

53:48.352 --> 53:49.602
- That's your real name?

53:50.520 --> 53:52.022
- As long as I can remember.

53:54.148 --> 53:56.567
- Don't tell me your
last name is Kringle.

53:56.652 --> 53:57.860
- Okay, I won't.

54:00.655 --> 54:01.405
- It's cold.

54:02.698 --> 54:04.158
- Well, I'm a fat guy.

54:06.035 --> 54:07.037
- That's gotta help.

54:08.330 --> 54:10.040
Hey, you want me to get
you a coffee or something?

54:10.123 --> 54:11.040
I'm not going anywhere.

54:11.123 --> 54:12.542
- Oh, no no, thank you though.

54:14.043 --> 54:15.670
- Well, if you need
anything just let me know.

54:15.753 --> 54:17.463
- Thank you, I appreciate that.

54:18.673 --> 54:21.927
Actually, I could
use a bathroom.

54:25.930 --> 54:27.890
(bell ringing)

54:27.973 --> 54:29.017
- Ho Ho Ho!

54:29.100 --> 54:30.352
Merry Christmas!

54:30.435 --> 54:31.645
- Is that your father?

54:31.728 --> 54:33.772
- [Dave] Ho ho ho,
Merry Christmas!

54:33.855 --> 54:34.897
- Dave?

54:34.982 --> 54:35.857
- Ho ho ho!

54:37.567 --> 54:39.860
- What are you doing?

54:39.943 --> 54:42.030
- Santa had to go
to the bathroom.

54:42.113 --> 54:44.073
- Dad, you're weird.

54:44.157 --> 54:46.952
- Ho ho ho, Merry
Christmas everyone.

54:47.035 --> 54:49.870
Ho ho, Merry Christmas everyone.

54:49.953 --> 54:50.705
Ho ho ho.

54:51.497 --> 54:52.290
Ho ho ho.

54:54.250 --> 54:55.668
Merry Christmas.

54:56.878 --> 54:57.670
- Dave!

54:59.713 --> 55:00.465
Dave!

55:04.343 --> 55:05.137
Dave!

55:07.013 --> 55:08.222
It's me, Susanna.

55:09.057 --> 55:11.267
From the Japan restaurant.

55:11.350 --> 55:12.352
- Oh, hi.

55:12.435 --> 55:14.187
- And you'll never
guess who's here.

55:14.270 --> 55:15.022
Fred!

55:16.355 --> 55:20.110
Fred, get your behind out
of the car man, it's Dave.

55:21.277 --> 55:25.115
He's been talking and talking
and talking about you.

55:25.198 --> 55:27.158
I'm so glad he
made a real friend.

55:27.242 --> 55:30.287
Those other guys used to
hang out with were losers.

55:30.370 --> 55:32.372
- Yo, bro, been trying
to call you man.

55:34.332 --> 55:36.417
- I don't remember
giving you my number.

55:36.500 --> 55:38.168
- You didn't, and honestly

55:38.252 --> 55:39.503
that's made it a
little difficult.

55:39.587 --> 55:41.130
You know how many Daves are
there in the phone book?

55:41.213 --> 55:44.300
I dialed like a hundred of
them but then I passed out.

55:44.383 --> 55:47.637
- He did, he was just trying
to call you like a 100 times.

55:47.720 --> 55:48.805
- Can I please?

55:48.888 --> 55:50.682
I literally just said that.

55:50.765 --> 55:52.183
- Okay all right.

55:52.267 --> 55:53.852
I'm gonna let you boys catch up,

55:53.935 --> 55:54.977
I'm heading inside.

55:58.147 --> 55:59.148
- She's great isn't she?

56:00.483 --> 56:02.277
I mean, she's always
going on and on,

56:02.360 --> 56:04.237
but how are you man?

56:05.738 --> 56:08.198
Hey, I've got some friends,
we got a bowling league.

56:08.282 --> 56:09.450
There's a waiting list,

56:09.533 --> 56:12.203
but I talked to
them and got you in.

56:13.455 --> 56:14.663
I mean you weren't
on it right away,

56:14.747 --> 56:16.707
I had to talk to them,
but you're on it.

56:16.792 --> 56:19.085
- Great, great, thanks.

56:20.128 --> 56:21.128
- It is great.

56:21.212 --> 56:22.505
Hey, what are you
doing tomorrow?

56:24.882 --> 56:26.968
- Tomorrow is a
Christmas day, Fred.

56:27.052 --> 56:27.927
I may be busy.

56:28.010 --> 56:29.220
- You wanna go hunting?

56:29.303 --> 56:30.555
I got a bunch of guns
in the truck right now.

56:30.638 --> 56:31.347
You wanna see 'em?

56:31.430 --> 56:32.348
- No, not now.

56:33.642 --> 56:35.268
- I'm serious.

56:35.352 --> 56:36.978
There's like a petting zoo,
just south of Grand Rapids.

56:37.062 --> 56:37.895
Nobody's there right now.

56:37.978 --> 56:39.563
We could bag 'em and tag 'em.

56:39.647 --> 56:41.817
- Well, that sounds great Fred.

56:41.900 --> 56:45.403
But tomorrow is Christmas
day and I think I have plans.

56:47.197 --> 56:48.238
I'll check with the wife.

56:51.952 --> 56:56.497
Thank you, Merry
Christmas. (bell ringing)

56:56.580 --> 56:58.917
- People just come up
and give you money?

56:59.000 --> 56:59.750
- Yeah.

57:01.710 --> 57:02.837
- Industry.

57:04.172 --> 57:06.090
Hey, I don't mean
to be too forward,

57:06.173 --> 57:10.010
but I'm a little light on
cash for the holidays and all.

57:11.345 --> 57:13.430
Think you could help out?

57:16.392 --> 57:19.770
(light orchestral music)

57:32.450 --> 57:34.452
- Warm in here, isn't it?

57:34.535 --> 57:37.913
(classical piano music)

57:41.375 --> 57:42.668
I want fresh air.

57:43.712 --> 57:47.257
(classical violin music)

57:51.845 --> 57:54.180
(exhaling)

58:00.270 --> 58:04.023
What the (indistinct) is this?

58:04.107 --> 58:05.317
Hey!

58:05.400 --> 58:08.193
You bunch of little delinquents!

58:10.280 --> 58:13.658
(bright orchestral music)

58:19.205 --> 58:20.415
- Go have fun.

58:31.217 --> 58:33.970
Hey you kids, do
whatever you wanna do.

58:39.475 --> 58:40.685
Merry Christmas.

58:40.768 --> 58:42.228
- Yeah, you too.

58:42.312 --> 58:43.437
Merry Christmas.

59:24.478 --> 59:26.522
- It's so cold.

59:26.605 --> 59:27.648
- Cold it is.

59:30.277 --> 59:31.485
- So, which one's yours?

59:33.070 --> 59:36.073
- You see the little
white one over there.

59:36.157 --> 59:38.450
It's my girlfriend's and mine.

59:38.533 --> 59:40.370
Yeah, she wanted a small dog.

59:40.453 --> 59:41.412
I wanted a big dog.

59:41.495 --> 59:45.040
So we compromised
and got a small dog.

59:45.123 --> 59:46.083
- Compromise, huh?

59:46.167 --> 59:47.377
- Yeah.

59:47.460 --> 59:48.712
- Yeah, when you get married,

59:48.795 --> 59:51.338
there's gonna be a lot
more compromises to come.

59:52.632 --> 59:54.758
- So anyway, which dog is yours?

59:56.010 --> 59:57.303
- I don't have a dog.

59:57.387 --> 59:58.345
But it's all I want though.

59:58.428 --> 01:00:00.348
I don't care about
any other gifts.

01:00:00.432 --> 01:00:03.433
I either want it for my
birthday or Christmas.

01:00:03.517 --> 01:00:05.395
- You know, a dog
can be a lot of work.

01:00:05.478 --> 01:00:07.522
- You're a lot of work.

01:00:07.605 --> 01:00:08.732
- That's what my mom says.

01:00:08.815 --> 01:00:10.358
But I'll do it all by myself.

01:00:10.442 --> 01:00:13.235
I'd walk it, I'd feed
it, I'd let it out,

01:00:13.318 --> 01:00:14.528
I'd take it to the dog park.

01:00:14.612 --> 01:00:17.157
And I'll hold it's paw
like that at the vet.

01:00:18.323 --> 01:00:20.283
- I hope you get
your wish this year.

01:00:20.368 --> 01:00:21.118
- Me too.

01:00:22.495 --> 01:00:23.872
- All right guys, I am freezing.

01:00:23.955 --> 01:00:24.705
I'm out of here.

01:00:26.623 --> 01:00:27.917
Lovie, come here.

01:00:28.793 --> 01:00:30.127
Lovie.

01:00:30.210 --> 01:00:32.255
My girl friend named
her, obviously.

01:00:33.172 --> 01:00:34.298
- Obviously.

01:00:34.382 --> 01:00:36.258
- Come here, come here girl.

01:00:39.095 --> 01:00:41.597
Can I ask you a favor?

01:00:44.267 --> 01:00:46.477
If you get near her.

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:47.770
She knows her name.

01:00:47.853 --> 01:00:48.813
If you just call it.

01:00:48.897 --> 01:00:50.313
- Who me?

01:00:50.398 --> 01:00:52.817
- I can't go with the crutches.

01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:56.112
All you gotta do is
just get near her,

01:00:56.195 --> 01:00:58.030
just call her name, and
she'll come right to you.

01:00:58.113 --> 01:00:59.782
- Okay, well.

01:00:59.865 --> 01:01:01.158
- I'm sorry, but-

01:01:04.537 --> 01:01:06.997
- All right, I'll
give it a shot.

01:01:07.082 --> 01:01:08.415
- Thanks, I appreciate it.

01:01:10.250 --> 01:01:14.588
Thanks, just need to get near
her and say her name, Lovie.

01:01:16.048 --> 01:01:17.383
- Come on dog.

01:01:22.763 --> 01:01:24.015
- Don't chase after her.

01:01:24.098 --> 01:01:25.683
If you chase her,
she's gonna run.

01:01:30.228 --> 01:01:31.563
- That's a boy.

01:01:34.108 --> 01:01:34.900
- He's back up.

01:01:35.902 --> 01:01:40.030
(comedic orchestral music)

01:01:40.113 --> 01:01:40.865
Come here.

01:01:41.865 --> 01:01:44.493
- Bloody dog, come on!

01:01:44.577 --> 01:01:46.120
- Come.

01:01:46.203 --> 01:01:47.580
See, you're a real-sized dog.

01:01:54.545 --> 01:01:55.880
No, lady, lady don't.

01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:00.552
Lady if you throw the ball,
she's gonna chase the ball.

01:02:04.472 --> 01:02:06.682
- Uncle Ben, watch out!

01:02:06.765 --> 01:02:07.517
- Aah.

01:02:11.603 --> 01:02:15.442
(uptempo orchestral music)

01:02:17.610 --> 01:02:19.695
- 20 bucks says Uncle
Ben falls first.

01:02:20.697 --> 01:02:22.240
- Uncle Daryl is going down.

01:02:29.747 --> 01:02:31.040
Dave, I just want to thank you

01:02:31.123 --> 01:02:33.835
for inviting me and my family
to join you for Christmas.

01:02:33.918 --> 01:02:35.878
- I wouldn't have it
any other way Matt.

01:02:36.878 --> 01:02:37.672
- Me too, Dave.

01:02:39.173 --> 01:02:41.383
From me and the whole
McCormick family,

01:02:41.467 --> 01:02:42.885
Merry Christmas.

01:02:42.968 --> 01:02:44.262
- Here's to my son,

01:02:44.345 --> 01:02:45.722
man of the house.

01:02:45.805 --> 01:02:48.723
Takes a lot of work
to have everybody in.

01:02:48.808 --> 01:02:50.225
He never complained.

01:02:50.308 --> 01:02:52.395
I'm proud of you, son.

01:02:52.478 --> 01:02:53.645
- Thank you.

01:02:53.728 --> 01:02:55.815
Everyone, thank you.

01:02:56.898 --> 01:02:58.067
Let's eat, dig in.

01:03:01.070 --> 01:03:02.988
- Boy oh boy oh boy,
that hit the spot.

01:03:04.573 --> 01:03:06.492
- Anybody gave me a
belt for Christmas?

01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:09.537
Who's ready for presents?

01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:12.290
- Ah, come on Dave, really?

01:03:12.373 --> 01:03:15.125
I think we need a little
nap before we can do that.

01:03:15.208 --> 01:03:16.460
Come on, let's go.

01:03:31.517 --> 01:03:34.353
- Santa can't deliver all
those presents in one night.

01:03:34.437 --> 01:03:37.565
Do you know, how many houses
there are all over the world?

01:03:37.648 --> 01:03:39.567
- Okay, if I can
deliver presents

01:03:39.650 --> 01:03:42.903
to every house in this
block in 60 seconds or less,

01:03:42.987 --> 01:03:44.905
that'll prove that
it's possible.

01:03:44.988 --> 01:03:47.658
- I don't think that it does.

01:03:47.742 --> 01:03:50.202
- Sure it does.

01:03:50.285 --> 01:03:52.037
- Three, two, one. Go!

01:03:54.707 --> 01:03:56.958
(kids cheering)

01:03:57.042 --> 01:03:58.627
Go, go, go.

01:03:58.710 --> 01:04:00.503
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

01:04:19.898 --> 01:04:21.108
- That's it.

01:04:21.192 --> 01:04:22.192
That is it.

01:04:23.235 --> 01:04:24.778
I've had enough.

01:04:24.862 --> 01:04:28.950
(high-tension orchestral music)

01:04:30.408 --> 01:04:32.160
- Probably Daryl, he always
takes a (indistinct).

01:04:34.205 --> 01:04:36.707
(muffled speaking)

01:04:36.790 --> 01:04:39.293
- Yeah, still putting
their names on things.

01:04:39.377 --> 01:04:40.502
- We're having some drink.

01:04:40.587 --> 01:04:41.337
- Oh, wow.

01:04:44.632 --> 01:04:46.717
- Aah, that hit the spot.

01:04:48.552 --> 01:04:49.553
Let's open presents.

01:04:50.805 --> 01:04:51.930
- Honey?

01:04:52.013 --> 01:04:53.848
You ready to open presents?

01:04:53.933 --> 01:04:54.850
- [Woman] Almost.

01:04:56.143 --> 01:04:57.937
- Quit stalling there, let's go.

01:04:59.647 --> 01:05:02.275
Kids! Presents!

01:05:06.862 --> 01:05:08.655
- [Woman] Yeah, I have a sponge.

01:05:08.738 --> 01:05:10.115
- I just took it.

01:05:10.198 --> 01:05:12.868
You know I'm not gonna use.

01:05:12.952 --> 01:05:15.705
(crowd murmuring)

01:05:18.707 --> 01:05:20.583
- [Mister Nicholas] David!

01:05:20.668 --> 01:05:23.087
David Madison, get out here.

01:05:23.170 --> 01:05:24.755
- I'll be right back.

01:05:28.717 --> 01:05:29.635
Wesley?

01:05:29.718 --> 01:05:30.678
Merry Christmas.

01:05:30.762 --> 01:05:34.890
- Put up your dukes,
you Yankee coward.

01:05:34.973 --> 01:05:35.725
Aah!

01:05:38.685 --> 01:05:40.730
- You think you Brits would
learn not to mess with America.

01:05:40.813 --> 01:05:41.563
Geez.

01:05:42.940 --> 01:05:44.150
(door closing)

01:05:44.233 --> 01:05:46.985
(crowd murmuring)

01:05:49.988 --> 01:05:50.865
- Oh, thanks dear.

01:05:59.623 --> 01:06:00.750
Oh, look.

01:06:02.083 --> 01:06:03.043
Oven mitts.

01:06:03.877 --> 01:06:05.587
- I didn't know what to get her.

01:06:06.963 --> 01:06:07.757
- Thanks dear.

01:06:09.133 --> 01:06:09.925
- Ben,

01:06:11.177 --> 01:06:12.470
what is that?

01:06:12.553 --> 01:06:15.305
- It's cabernet, fantastic wine.

01:06:15.388 --> 01:06:17.098
You guys want me
to get you some?

01:06:17.182 --> 01:06:18.600
- Ooh, no thank you,

01:06:18.683 --> 01:06:21.478
I just don't allow beverages
in the living room.

01:06:21.562 --> 01:06:22.897
- I won't spill, so.

01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:25.232
- Oh well, it's just the rule.

01:06:25.315 --> 01:06:27.860
Just sort of a house rule.

01:06:27.943 --> 01:06:29.945
- I assure you, I am very good

01:06:30.028 --> 01:06:31.738
with beverage management, Sandy.

01:06:36.785 --> 01:06:38.287
(gasping)

01:06:38.370 --> 01:06:40.915
- Oh, did you sew this yourself?

01:06:40.998 --> 01:06:42.417
- I did.

01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:44.585
- Thank you so much.

01:06:44.668 --> 01:06:45.418
- You're welcome.

01:06:47.128 --> 01:06:48.505
- I picked out the fabric.

01:06:49.798 --> 01:06:50.842
- Thank you.

01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:55.553
So pretty.

01:06:55.637 --> 01:06:57.848
- Don't ever do that again.

01:06:57.932 --> 01:07:01.393
(bright instrumental music)

01:07:03.353 --> 01:07:06.273
("Deck the Halls")

01:07:32.592 --> 01:07:33.883
- It's for you Aunt Carol.

01:07:35.135 --> 01:07:36.887
- Thank you, honey.

01:07:36.970 --> 01:07:40.473
It's-

01:07:40.557 --> 01:07:43.352
- Because it's Christmas
and your birthday.

01:07:43.435 --> 01:07:44.187
- Yeah.

01:07:44.270 --> 01:07:45.645
- And you're 50.

01:07:46.647 --> 01:07:47.773
- Yeah.

01:07:47.857 --> 01:07:49.483
- It's a sign for the yard.

01:07:49.567 --> 01:07:50.818
I'm gonna go put it out.

01:07:50.902 --> 01:07:53.028
- It's okay sweetie,
we can do it later.

01:07:53.862 --> 01:07:55.990
(sighing)

01:07:56.073 --> 01:07:57.450
- And you're 50.

01:07:58.492 --> 01:08:01.120
(laughing)

01:08:01.203 --> 01:08:02.788
- Cut it out, dad.

01:08:17.135 --> 01:08:18.803
- Honestly?

01:08:18.886 --> 01:08:20.848
Is this really necessary?

01:08:20.932 --> 01:08:21.932
I know it's my birthday.

01:08:22.015 --> 01:08:23.183
- And you're 50.

01:08:23.267 --> 01:08:24.977
- [Carol] I've heard.

01:08:25.060 --> 01:08:26.020
- Okay, I'm opening.

01:08:26.103 --> 01:08:27.437
Whose it from anyway?

01:08:27.522 --> 01:08:28.229
- Me, Uncle Matt.

01:08:28.313 --> 01:08:29.982
- Oh, thanks sweetie.

01:08:30.942 --> 01:08:32.943
And it's a tie.

01:08:33.027 --> 01:08:33.777
Thank you.

01:08:34.819 --> 01:08:35.904
- Let's see it.

01:08:35.988 --> 01:08:38.573
- Yeah, no, that's all right.

01:08:38.657 --> 01:08:39.617
- Let's see.

01:08:46.832 --> 01:08:48.082
- Do you like it, dad?

01:08:50.167 --> 01:08:51.002
- Try it on.

01:08:52.712 --> 01:08:53.462
- What?

01:08:53.546 --> 01:08:55.048
- Go on.

01:08:55.131 --> 01:08:56.091
Well, I'm already wearing-

01:08:56.175 --> 01:08:57.926
- Try it on, Matt.

01:08:58.010 --> 01:08:59.178
- All right.

01:08:59.261 --> 01:09:00.553
All right, birthday girl.

01:09:04.183 --> 01:09:07.603
(uptempo holiday music)

01:09:28.540 --> 01:09:30.125
- Let's give him a suplex.

01:09:31.335 --> 01:09:33.752
Go, go, go.

01:09:33.837 --> 01:09:35.087
- And that Ben,

01:09:35.171 --> 01:09:37.465
is why we have a no beverages
in the living room policy.

01:09:37.550 --> 01:09:38.800
- I'm just standing here.

01:09:38.883 --> 01:09:40.970
- And now there's
wine on my carpet.

01:09:41.053 --> 01:09:43.930
- Maybe you should have a
no full contact wrestling

01:09:44.013 --> 01:09:46.683
in the living room
policy, Sandy.

01:09:46.767 --> 01:09:49.228
- Looks like you got little
wine on you there partner.

01:09:49.312 --> 01:09:50.897
- Yeah, little wine.

01:09:50.979 --> 01:09:53.689
- That's why it's
good to have two ties.

01:09:53.773 --> 01:09:54.650
That's gonna stain.

01:09:55.567 --> 01:09:58.445
- All right kids, that's it.

01:09:58.528 --> 01:09:59.613
Let's round up.

01:10:01.198 --> 01:10:01.948
Everybody to bed.

01:10:02.032 --> 01:10:04.033
Let's go, yeah, yeah!

01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:07.245
Yeah yeah!

01:10:09.248 --> 01:10:11.000
Okay, let's get the drinks.

01:10:11.083 --> 01:10:12.208
- Yes, all right.

01:10:15.212 --> 01:10:16.588
- Let's go, cowpoke.

01:10:16.672 --> 01:10:19.550
(laughing)

01:10:19.633 --> 01:10:21.343
- "Twas the night
before Christmas,

01:10:21.427 --> 01:10:23.178
and all through the house,

01:10:23.262 --> 01:10:25.097
not a creature was stirring,

01:10:25.180 --> 01:10:26.682
not even a mouse.

01:10:26.765 --> 01:10:30.060
The stockings were hung
by the chimney with care,

01:10:30.143 --> 01:10:33.480
in hopes that Saint Nicholas
soon would be there.

01:10:33.563 --> 01:10:36.858
The children were nestled all
snug in their wee little beds,

01:10:36.942 --> 01:10:39.027
while visions of sugar plums

01:10:39.110 --> 01:10:41.280
danced in their
wee little heads.

01:10:41.363 --> 01:10:43.657
Mama in her kerchief,
and I in my cap,

01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:48.620
Had just settled our brains
for a long winter's nap.

01:10:48.703 --> 01:10:51.623
When out on the lawn there
arose such a clatter,

01:10:51.707 --> 01:10:54.585
I sprang from my bed to
see what was the matter.

01:10:54.668 --> 01:10:57.378
Away to the window
I flew like a flash,

01:10:57.462 --> 01:10:59.130
tore open the shutters,

01:11:01.342 --> 01:11:03.385
threw open the sash.

01:11:03.468 --> 01:11:06.055
The moon on the breast
of the new-fallen snow

01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:11.018
gave a luster of midday
to objects below.

01:11:11.102 --> 01:11:13.437
When what to my wondering
eyes should appear,

01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:17.942
but a miniature sleigh
and eight tiny reindeer.

01:11:18.025 --> 01:11:21.195
With a little old driver
so lively and quick,

01:11:21.278 --> 01:11:24.823
I knew in a moment that
it must be Saint Nick,

01:11:26.492 --> 01:11:30.412
and he whistled and shouted
and called them by name.

01:11:30.495 --> 01:11:35.458
Happy Christmas to all,
and to all a good night."

01:11:36.293 --> 01:11:37.168
- You skipped some, Grandpa.

01:11:37.252 --> 01:11:39.547
- Well, you got the gist of it.

01:11:39.630 --> 01:11:42.257
Well, Grandpa loves you all.

01:11:42.340 --> 01:11:43.092
Good night.

01:11:46.345 --> 01:11:48.138
- Hey, we're going to bed.

01:11:48.222 --> 01:11:48.888
- Good night.

01:11:48.972 --> 01:11:50.015
- Good night.

01:11:55.187 --> 01:11:57.732
- I'm going out for little walk.

01:12:10.202 --> 01:12:13.622
(footsteps on the roof)

01:12:16.375 --> 01:12:18.293
- Wake up, wake up!

01:12:18.377 --> 01:12:19.210
- What?

01:12:19.293 --> 01:12:20.295
- He's here, he's really here.

01:12:20.378 --> 01:12:23.173
- I knew it, I knew
Santa Claus is real.

01:12:23.257 --> 01:12:24.298
- It's true, and tomorrow

01:12:24.383 --> 01:12:26.927
I'm gonna get a
puppy for Christmas.

01:12:27.010 --> 01:12:29.430
I'm gonna get a
puppy for Christmas.

01:12:32.140 --> 01:12:34.225
- On Dancer, on Prancer,

01:12:34.308 --> 01:12:36.228
dash away Richard Nixon,

01:12:36.312 --> 01:12:39.398
NFL blitzin' and however
the heck it goes.

01:12:39.482 --> 01:12:43.860
All led by a drunk reindeer
with a big red nose.

01:12:50.158 --> 01:12:52.160
- You're taking
up all the space.

01:12:52.243 --> 01:12:54.370
I need a spot for my
kid too, you know.

01:12:55.288 --> 01:12:56.248
- What about in there?

01:12:56.332 --> 01:12:57.290
- Yeah.

01:12:58.292 --> 01:13:00.585
- What? Under the kitchen table?

01:13:01.837 --> 01:13:02.628
- Sure.

01:13:03.463 --> 01:13:04.923
- Yeah.

01:13:05.007 --> 01:13:07.300
- You trying to invent
a new holiday, Matt?

01:13:07.383 --> 01:13:10.387
Santa is not bringing
presents to Kassandra,

01:13:10.470 --> 01:13:11.722
under the table.

01:13:11.805 --> 01:13:14.265
- But, we're all set up
and we were here first.

01:13:14.348 --> 01:13:16.685
- You're like Columbus
talking to the Indians.

01:13:16.768 --> 01:13:18.103
This is my home.

01:13:19.353 --> 01:13:21.273
Now, I'm gonna go
out to the trunk,

01:13:21.357 --> 01:13:22.273
I'm gonna get Santa's presents,

01:13:22.357 --> 01:13:24.025
And when I come back,

01:13:24.108 --> 01:13:27.320
there's gonna be a nice
big space under that tree.

01:13:29.030 --> 01:13:29.823
Okay?

01:13:49.843 --> 01:13:52.428
(playful music)

01:14:00.812 --> 01:14:04.315
- A drunken reindeer
with a big red nose.

01:14:06.735 --> 01:14:08.362
- Pretty nice table.

01:14:08.445 --> 01:14:09.195
- Yeah.

01:14:10.322 --> 01:14:11.615
- Told Carol I'd be right up.

01:14:13.408 --> 01:14:16.035
- We could just
play one quick game.

01:14:18.663 --> 01:14:20.582
- All right.
- But I'm first.

01:14:20.665 --> 01:14:24.043
(uptempo comedic music)

01:14:26.588 --> 01:14:29.423
(yelling)

01:14:29.508 --> 01:14:31.092
- Another Christmas down,

01:14:31.177 --> 01:14:35.430
another family Christmas
through the hole.

01:14:35.513 --> 01:14:37.515
(yelling)

01:14:40.477 --> 01:14:41.228
- She is my sister.

01:14:41.312 --> 01:14:42.312
- What?

01:14:42.395 --> 01:14:43.772
- She's also cold.

01:14:43.855 --> 01:14:46.733
(yelling)

01:14:46.817 --> 01:14:49.193
(laughing)

01:14:56.158 --> 01:14:57.077
- Be there.

01:14:58.578 --> 01:15:00.163
- No. No.

01:15:00.247 --> 01:15:03.333
- Bring it up, just bring
it at me one more time.

01:15:03.417 --> 01:15:05.668
(grunting)

01:15:08.922 --> 01:15:11.258
(confused crosstalk)

01:15:11.342 --> 01:15:13.552
- Come on, put it in there bro.

01:15:17.805 --> 01:15:18.932
- One more.

01:15:19.015 --> 01:15:21.435
One more, I know, one more.

01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:26.607
(cheering)

01:15:27.773 --> 01:15:30.110
Okay, one more, Ben.

01:15:30.193 --> 01:15:31.237
Double digit.

01:15:32.237 --> 01:15:34.405
(mumbling)

01:15:40.828 --> 01:15:42.330
- Wait for it.

01:15:42.413 --> 01:15:43.707
Wait for it.

01:15:43.790 --> 01:15:46.042
There it is Ben.

01:15:48.670 --> 01:15:50.963

they're gonna come down.

01:16:29.043 --> 01:16:30.503
- Besides, Santa's coming.

01:16:36.718 --> 01:16:39.345
(light music)

01:16:41.138 --> 01:16:42.015
You know,

01:16:42.098 --> 01:16:43.517
I spend a lot time asking people

01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:45.435
what they would
like for Christmas.

01:16:45.518 --> 01:16:48.313
May be I could tell
you what I would like.

01:16:48.397 --> 01:16:50.565
Spend a little less on presents,

01:16:50.648 --> 01:16:52.400
and give a little
more to charity.

01:16:53.527 --> 01:16:55.487
Be kind to one another
because really,

01:16:55.570 --> 01:16:58.240
that is what Christmas
is all about.

01:16:58.323 --> 01:17:00.408
Now, here it is folks.

01:17:00.492 --> 01:17:01.410
The main event,

01:17:01.493 --> 01:17:03.578
live from Rockford, Michigan.

01:17:03.662 --> 01:17:05.080
It's Christmas morning.

01:17:07.207 --> 01:17:08.417
Ho ho ho!

01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:12.420
(dramatic orchestral music)

01:17:22.180 --> 01:17:23.515
- Guys, wake up, wake up.

01:17:23.598 --> 01:17:26.435
Presents! It's
time for presents!

01:17:26.518 --> 01:17:29.062
(festive music)

01:18:00.718 --> 01:18:01.845
- They're up.

01:18:04.555 --> 01:18:06.725
Come on, cowpoke, lets go.

01:18:07.850 --> 01:18:09.185
- Couple more hours.

01:18:11.397 --> 01:18:13.732
- You are not missing
Christmas morning.

01:18:13.815 --> 01:18:16.067
- There's a camcorder
in the closet.

01:18:16.150 --> 01:18:17.110
Videotape it.

01:18:19.237 --> 01:18:20.030
- David,

01:18:20.988 --> 01:18:21.782
up!

01:18:24.533 --> 01:18:27.328
(kids chattering)

01:18:51.645 --> 01:18:52.687
- Coffee.

01:18:57.192 --> 01:18:57.983
Coffee.

01:19:00.237 --> 01:19:03.157
- Matt, can you
make a fire, please?

01:19:04.323 --> 01:19:05.825
Matt?

01:19:05.908 --> 01:19:08.245
- Jeez, what?

01:19:08.328 --> 01:19:09.412
- Make a fire please.

01:19:11.330 --> 01:19:12.123
- Okay.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:14.877
- Now, Matt?

01:19:16.335 --> 01:19:17.587
- Okay.

01:19:17.670 --> 01:19:20.673
(kids chattering)

01:19:24.593 --> 01:19:26.303
All right, move over.

01:19:29.765 --> 01:19:31.433
You too, get something to eat.

01:19:39.317 --> 01:19:40.860
We'll have a fire mind you.

01:19:42.570 --> 01:19:45.115
It's 78 degrees in here.

01:19:45.198 --> 01:19:48.535
(Grandpa yelling)

01:19:48.618 --> 01:19:50.662
- Mister Madison?

01:19:50.745 --> 01:19:52.205
- Dad?

01:19:52.288 --> 01:19:53.832
- I'm stuck in the chimney.

01:19:53.915 --> 01:19:55.583
- Sandy!
(screaming)

01:19:55.667 --> 01:19:56.835
Call 911!

01:19:56.918 --> 01:19:58.127
- [Grandpa] Freezing
my rear end off.

01:19:58.212 --> 01:20:00.588
- Mister Madison, what
are you doing up there?

01:20:00.672 --> 01:20:02.882
- Get me the hell out of here,

01:20:02.965 --> 01:20:07.720
then we can play
twenty questions with
my idiot son-in-law.

01:20:07.803 --> 01:20:10.640
(siren winding down)

01:20:12.142 --> 01:20:13.893
- [Santa] That Grandpa is
quite the character, isn't he?

01:20:13.977 --> 01:20:16.730
Ho ho ho, as long
as I can remember,

01:20:16.813 --> 01:20:18.565
he's been one of my favorites.

01:20:18.648 --> 01:20:21.108
Oh, he's gone a little
gruff in his old age.

01:20:21.192 --> 01:20:22.985
But he loves his family.

01:20:23.068 --> 01:20:24.487
That's what's important.

01:20:27.157 --> 01:20:28.700
- Just all kinds of stuff.

01:20:28.783 --> 01:20:29.868
Just clutter.

01:20:29.952 --> 01:20:31.493
The gifts are too big,

01:20:31.578 --> 01:20:32.912
and nobody really needs them.

01:20:34.663 --> 01:20:36.332
- What can I say?

01:20:36.415 --> 01:20:39.085
I like the gifts though.

01:20:39.168 --> 01:20:40.795
- Matt?
- Huh?

01:20:40.878 --> 01:20:42.672
Yeah, sure, hon.

01:20:42.755 --> 01:20:45.008
- Now look, I've put
everybody's name in the hat.

01:20:45.092 --> 01:20:46.718
We'll each draw out a name,

01:20:46.802 --> 01:20:48.262
and that's the person you're
buying a gift for next year.

01:20:48.345 --> 01:20:50.388
- I's Christmas day, Carol.

01:20:50.472 --> 01:20:52.432
Do we really need to
worry about it now?

01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:55.268
- Yes, when else
will all be together?

01:20:55.352 --> 01:20:56.895
If we don't talk about it now,

01:20:56.978 --> 01:20:58.187
it will never get done.

01:20:58.272 --> 01:21:00.232
Daryl, you get to go first.

01:21:04.152 --> 01:21:05.820
- I got my name,
Daryl McCormick.

01:21:08.782 --> 01:21:10.408
- There you go, you can buy
yourself some orange soda,

01:21:10.492 --> 01:21:11.743
and put your name on it.

01:21:14.162 --> 01:21:14.955
- Or oven mitts.

01:21:32.805 --> 01:21:33.848
- You feeling better, Grandpa?

01:21:33.932 --> 01:21:36.517
- Ah, me? Sure, sure.

01:21:36.602 --> 01:21:37.768
Takes a lot more than that

01:21:37.852 --> 01:21:39.687
to knock your old
Grandpa off his game.

01:21:41.982 --> 01:21:43.107
How'd you do this year?

01:21:43.190 --> 01:21:44.692
You make out?

01:21:44.775 --> 01:21:46.235
- Okay, I guess.

01:21:46.318 --> 01:21:47.737
- Okay, you guess?

01:21:47.820 --> 01:21:49.280
- I don't wanna complain.

01:21:50.823 --> 01:21:52.825
- You mean you didn't get
everything you wanted?

01:21:54.743 --> 01:21:55.912
Well, maybe next year.

01:21:56.830 --> 01:21:57.747
- No.

01:21:57.830 --> 01:21:58.790
- No!

01:21:59.873 --> 01:22:01.250
- I was really good this year.

01:22:01.333 --> 01:22:02.502
Really, I was.

01:22:02.585 --> 01:22:05.005
And that's all I wanted.

01:22:05.088 --> 01:22:08.550
And if Santa Claus didn't
bring me a dog this year,

01:22:08.633 --> 01:22:09.800
why would he next year?

01:22:09.883 --> 01:22:13.305
- Well, maybe your
parents for your birthday.

01:22:13.388 --> 01:22:14.430
- They never will.

01:22:15.682 --> 01:22:17.850
I just thought, if
I was good enough

01:22:17.933 --> 01:22:19.768
and if I wanted it bad.

01:22:20.728 --> 01:22:21.897
- Well, I'm sorry.

01:22:21.980 --> 01:22:24.273
You know, I did as best I could.

01:22:25.192 --> 01:22:26.860
- I still love you, Grandpa.

01:22:26.943 --> 01:22:28.528
(Grandpa chuckling)

01:22:28.612 --> 01:22:29.528
- What was that?

01:22:29.612 --> 01:22:30.322
- What?

01:22:30.405 --> 01:22:31.155
- That noise.

01:22:32.073 --> 01:22:33.867
- I don't hear anything.

01:22:33.950 --> 01:22:35.410
- From the basement that

01:22:35.493 --> 01:22:37.787
whining, barking sound.

01:22:37.870 --> 01:22:41.917
(building orchestral music)

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:46.087
(bright orchestral music)

01:22:46.170 --> 01:22:47.797
- [Kassandra] A
puppy! I got a puppy!

01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:49.340
I don't believe this.

01:22:49.423 --> 01:22:51.092
- Dad, what's going on?

01:22:52.427 --> 01:22:53.345
- [Kassandra] I
don't believe this.

01:22:53.428 --> 01:22:54.762
- [Grandpa] What's the big deal?

01:22:54.845 --> 01:22:57.348
- You can't just buy her a
dog without our permission.

01:22:57.432 --> 01:22:58.683
- Unbelievable.

01:22:58.767 --> 01:23:00.435
- [Grandpa] You had a
dog when you were a kid.

01:23:00.518 --> 01:23:02.062
Every kid should have a dog.

01:23:02.145 --> 01:23:03.855
- Do you even know
what kind it is?

01:23:03.938 --> 01:23:05.482
It's a, it's a, well it's,

01:23:06.315 --> 01:23:07.233
I don't know.

01:23:07.317 --> 01:23:09.068
I told the guy to get a big dog,

01:23:09.152 --> 01:23:11.112
you don't want those
little rat dogs.

01:23:11.195 --> 01:23:13.823
- This is a major
family decision, Dad.

01:23:13.907 --> 01:23:15.408
A dog is a lot of work.

01:23:15.492 --> 01:23:19.620
- Nonsense, you always
over-dramatize everything.

01:23:19.703 --> 01:23:20.872
(dog yelping)

01:23:20.955 --> 01:23:22.832
- [Carol] No, don't let him up

01:23:22.915 --> 01:23:23.625
- [Kid] That knee, it's bad.

01:23:23.708 --> 01:23:24.917
- [David] Get off there!

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.753
(dog yelping)

01:23:26.837 --> 01:23:28.463
Down, come here.

01:23:28.547 --> 01:23:32.175
(talking over each other)

01:23:32.258 --> 01:23:33.885
Get off there!

01:23:33.968 --> 01:23:35.137
- [Sandy] David, do something!

01:23:35.220 --> 01:23:37.930
- [David] I got him, I got him.

01:23:39.973 --> 01:23:44.520
- [Sandy] Oh, my
china. (sighing)

01:23:44.603 --> 01:23:45.855
- So, there you have it.

01:23:45.938 --> 01:23:48.608
The Madisons got a
dog for Christmas.

01:23:48.692 --> 01:23:50.652
Dave and Sandy may not
have wanted him at first,

01:23:50.735 --> 01:23:51.903
but, throughout the years,

01:23:51.987 --> 01:23:54.280
that dog brought a lot of love

01:23:54.363 --> 01:23:55.740
into the Madison home.

01:23:57.492 --> 01:23:59.035
Dave swore that he would never

01:23:59.118 --> 01:24:02.622
have any of his or Sandy's
family over ever again.

01:24:02.705 --> 01:24:03.623
Well, you know Dave,

01:24:03.707 --> 01:24:05.833
next year he was
excited as ever.

01:24:07.002 --> 01:24:08.795
It wasn't always easy.

01:24:08.878 --> 01:24:10.338
One year, Dave got kicked

01:24:10.422 --> 01:24:11.547
while trying to set up

01:24:11.630 --> 01:24:13.758
a live reindeer display
in the front yard.

01:24:13.842 --> 01:24:16.343
Then there was the time
he nearly froze to death,

01:24:16.427 --> 01:24:17.970
while trying to prove to Sandy

01:24:18.053 --> 01:24:20.848
that the ice was thick
enough for skating.

01:24:20.932 --> 01:24:21.933
(chuckling)

01:24:22.017 --> 01:24:24.810
Well, over time,

01:24:24.893 --> 01:24:27.897
we gained a few new
Madisons and well,

01:24:27.980 --> 01:24:29.482
we lost an older one.

01:24:29.565 --> 01:24:33.152
But the family and their loving
dog always stayed together.

01:24:34.362 --> 01:24:36.613
From all of us here
at Rockford, Michigan,

01:24:36.697 --> 01:24:38.115
Merry Christmas,

01:24:38.198 --> 01:24:40.160
and to all a good night.

01:24:41.743 --> 01:24:45.332
(festive orchestral music)
