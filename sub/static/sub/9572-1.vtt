So, how are we today?

00:11.671 --> 00:14.004
Good?
The Guy:
I'm all right, yeah.

00:14.004 --> 00:18.004
You like some water?
Yeah, sure, that'd be nice.

00:18.004 --> 00:19.837
Can we get Guy water?

00:21.338 --> 00:25.879
So, what can we do
for you today, Mr. Man?

00:25.879 --> 00:29.004
Uh... just a trim,
really.

00:29.004 --> 00:31.046
You know, the usual?

00:31.046 --> 00:33.296
You don't seem so sure.

Okay. I think it's time

01:16.421 --> 01:18.380
Wait, why can't
I move my hands?

01:18.380 --> 01:20.213
Just relax, please.

01:20.213 --> 01:22.004
Wait a second,
you don't need
to use those.

01:22.004 --> 01:23.712
Don't use those.
I don't need that.

01:23.712 --> 01:25.213
All right.

01:39.421 --> 01:40.962
Oh, weird.

01:43.171 --> 01:44.837
That was so weird.

01:45.962 --> 01:48.338
Weird dream.

01:50.796 --> 01:53.546
Dude, it was like--
No, no, no, no.

01:53.546 --> 01:55.380
I like you, but...

01:55.380 --> 01:58.254
your worst quality
is your dream sharing.

01:59.338 --> 02:02.962
What? Are you
fucking kidding me?

02:02.962 --> 02:04.754
Your ayahuasca trip sharing

02:04.754 --> 02:08.129
is something I'd like
to nominate as much worse.

02:08.129 --> 02:11.879
Oh, look! The envelope
just came in.

02:11.879 --> 02:14.213
Oh! And the award

02:14.213 --> 02:17.088
for the worst quality
goes to you,

02:17.088 --> 02:19.171

fucking night farting.

02:19.171 --> 02:21.254
Oh my God.

02:21.254 --> 02:22.837
You heard that, huh?

02:22.837 --> 02:24.421
Yeah, yeah, I heard it.

02:24.421 --> 02:26.505
It was super fucking loud.

02:26.505 --> 02:27.921
I was asleep
and you woke me

02:27.921 --> 02:31.213
when your asshole was
just coughing up a lung.

02:31.213 --> 02:34.254
I think this was like,
uh, last year's Oscars

02:34.254 --> 02:36.505
and there must've
been a mix-up.

02:36.505 --> 02:38.463

I'll be Faye Dunaway.

02:38.463 --> 02:39.588

Oh, I'm the Warren Beatty.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:41.671 --> 02:44.754
I'd like to accept this award
on behalf of all the children

02:44.754 --> 02:47.546

to night fart.

to thank my colon

02:49.338 --> 02:52.004

Oh, shit.

02:52.004 --> 02:54.671

What?

Oh, thank God

to an email that was like,

"Hey, Brian, we really
need you to come in today."

04:31.754 --> 04:34.505

recognize you, man.

I lost some weight.

Yeah, it's great.
How'd you do that?

04:54.921 --> 04:58.421
Cody:
Exercise, and I, like, changed
my whole relationship with food.

04:58.421 --> 05:01.588
I've been spinning,
running, weight lifting.

05:01.588 --> 05:03.546
Okay.
I've been eating
a lot of salads.

05:03.546 --> 05:05.129
