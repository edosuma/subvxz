WEBVTT

00:01.877 --> 00:05.464
Fraggle Rock! Fraggle Rock!
Fraggle Rock! Fraggle Rock!

00:05.547 --> 00:09.218
Fraggle Rock! Fraggle Rock!
Fraggle Rock! Fraggle Rock!

00:09.301 --> 00:12.888
Fraggle Rock! Fraggle Rock!
Fraggle Rock! Fraggle Rock!

00:12.971 --> 00:16.558
Fraggle Rock! Fraggle Rock!
Fraggle Rock! Fraggle Rock!

00:16.642 --> 00:20.437
Fraggle Rock! Fraggle Rock!
Fraggle Rock! Fraggle Rock!

00:20.521 --> 00:24.149
Each day's a party
If you haven't noticed

00:24.233 --> 00:27.402
Confetti flying every single moment

00:27.486 --> 00:30.739
That's why we splash and swim
And clap our feet

00:30.822 --> 00:32.491
'Cause when you're a Fraggle…

00:32.573 --> 00:34.284
A party's just the thing you need

00:35.077 --> 00:38.914
Don't wanna miss
This special celebration

00:38.997 --> 00:42.584
For Matt the traveler
From Outer Space then

00:42.668 --> 00:45.838
-A party for some pants
-Whoopee and then we'll dance

00:45.921 --> 00:49.758
So bring your radish hat, yeah!

00:49.842 --> 00:53.220
Hey! Okay, it's a party down
At Fraggle Rock

00:53.303 --> 00:55.138
Today, okay

00:55.222 --> 00:59.059
And everyone's invited to the
Most perfect kinda day

00:59.142 --> 01:00.853
At least since yesterday

01:00.936 --> 01:05.065
Hey! Okay, it's a party down
At Fraggle Rock today

01:06.316 --> 01:10.279
I'm always twirling, diving
Let's get going

01:10.362 --> 01:13.991
I always keep it Zen
Stay in the moment

01:14.074 --> 01:17.244
I'm an adventurer, I lead the crowd

01:17.327 --> 01:18.620
I'd rather do laundry.

01:18.704 --> 01:21.248
I love my friends
I'll say it loud

01:21.331 --> 01:24.751
Hey! Okay, it's a party down
At Fraggle Rock

01:24.835 --> 01:26.503
Today, okay

01:26.587 --> 01:30.591
And everyone's invited to the
Most perfect kinda day

01:30.674 --> 01:32.176
At least since yesterday

01:32.259 --> 01:38.390
Hey! Okay, it's a party down
At Fraggle Rock today

01:38.473 --> 01:42.186
Let's party down today

01:42.269 --> 01:45.772
Let's party down today

01:47.024 --> 01:52.237
Hey! Okay, it's a party down
At Fraggle Rock today

01:55.324 --> 01:56.617
I like that song.

02:01.955 --> 02:04.750
This is some send-off
for my Uncle Travelling Matt.

02:04.833 --> 02:06.710
-Yeah.
-An old-fashioned ska-doo.

02:06.793 --> 02:08.669
What's that word, Gobo? I like it.

02:08.753 --> 02:10.714
-I like it too.
-Ska-doo?

02:10.797 --> 02:12.007
Well, it's like--

02:12.090 --> 02:14.885
My understanding is
it's like a word for big party.

02:14.968 --> 02:16.386
-No, it's not.
-Ska-doo!

02:16.470 --> 02:18.180
Not a word.

02:18.263 --> 02:20.516
-Ska-diddle-diddle-doo!
-Still not a word.

02:20.599 --> 02:21.683
Well, either way,

02:21.767 --> 02:24.561
my Uncle Matt's gotta get back
to exploring Outer Space.

02:24.645 --> 02:25.646
Hey, check it out.

02:26.313 --> 02:29.441
I drew him a picture of the two of us
as a going-away present.

02:30.025 --> 02:31.527
Is there anything you can't do?

02:31.610 --> 02:32.611
Well…

02:32.694 --> 02:35.864
Hey, do you like
this streamer or this one?

02:35.948 --> 02:38.492
I feel like this one, it has oomph.

02:38.575 --> 02:40.285
-And boomph.
-Yeah.

02:40.369 --> 02:42.996
-But the short one is playful and cute.
-Yeah.

02:43.080 --> 02:45.791
But the long one is nice and silly.

02:45.874 --> 02:46.875
Short one?

02:46.959 --> 02:47.960
-Long one?
-Yeah.

02:48.043 --> 02:52.130
-Short one? Long one? Short one? Long one?
-He's wembling.

02:52.214 --> 02:53.924
Quick, turn him upside down.

02:55.968 --> 02:57.511
Hey, Wembley.

02:57.594 --> 03:01.181
Okay, here's what we're gonna do.
Deep breath in.

03:01.265 --> 03:04.017
The light, the sound, the feeling.

03:04.101 --> 03:05.894
And deep breath out.

03:05.978 --> 03:09.106
-The space, the void, rebirth.
-Yeah.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.233
-Better? Okay.
-Yeah! Thanks, Mokey.

03:11.316 --> 03:12.734
There you go.

03:12.818 --> 03:16.280
-Feel better, buddy? Yeah, sure.
-Thanks, I needed that.

03:16.363 --> 03:17.781
Since your uncle has decided

03:17.865 --> 03:20.659
to foolishly return to Outer Space
and certain peril,

03:20.742 --> 03:22.953
I've made him an emergency kit.

03:24.121 --> 03:27.791
If he gets a smudge, blue bottle.
If he gets a smear, orange bottle.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.418
If he gets a stain that sets,

03:29.501 --> 03:32.087
yellow bottle
and a quick yah with the brush.

03:32.171 --> 03:34.298
So it's more of a laundry kit?

03:34.381 --> 03:36.466
Well, can't bogged down with semantics.

03:36.550 --> 03:39.595
Hey, friendos!

03:39.678 --> 03:41.722
I'm gonna knock Matt's socks off

03:41.805 --> 03:46.351
with the most splat-defying slide and dive
the Rock has ever seen.

03:46.435 --> 03:47.686
Yeah!

03:49.146 --> 03:50.606
There's a twist.

03:50.689 --> 03:51.899
A tuck.

03:51.982 --> 03:53.317
A flip.

03:53.400 --> 03:56.403
-And a flup!
-That sounds so cool, Red.

03:56.486 --> 03:58.405
-What a great ska-doo.
-Yeah.

03:58.488 --> 03:59.781
Still not a word.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.367
What's that?

04:06.663 --> 04:07.873
Uncle Matt!

04:07.956 --> 04:11.710
Yes, it is me. Good job recognizing me,
young nephew Gobo.

04:15.255 --> 04:16.673
Who put that rock there?

04:17.632 --> 04:19.051
You did, sir.

04:19.134 --> 04:22.221
Well, then it's perfectly placed.
Thank you, Pogey.

04:22.304 --> 04:26.475
Hey, Gobo's Uncle Matt.
Ready for the most stunt-rific dive ever?

04:26.558 --> 04:29.895
Absolutely.
You have my undivided attention, Red.

04:29.978 --> 04:31.855
Okay, here we go.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.148
-Three…
-Gobo.

04:33.232 --> 04:34.733
-Two…
-Walk with me.

04:34.816 --> 04:36.401
-One--
-Come along.

04:36.485 --> 04:39.279
You see, Gobo, there's
a few things I haven't told you.

04:39.363 --> 04:41.323
But I-- It's okay.

04:41.406 --> 04:45.244
I was excited to dive, but hey, I'll wait.

04:47.412 --> 04:50.666
Look at us, walking and talking.

04:50.749 --> 04:53.460
Some Fraggles walk. Other Fraggles talk.

04:53.544 --> 04:55.754
Me? I do both. Well--

04:57.422 --> 04:59.258
I'm all right.

04:59.341 --> 05:02.010
-Gobo. I want to show you something.
-Okay.

05:02.094 --> 05:06.014
Get ready,
because your mind is going to be…

05:06.098 --> 05:07.808
…impressed.

05:08.934 --> 05:10.519
Behold!

05:15.440 --> 05:16.984
-Amazing.
-Yes.

05:17.067 --> 05:20.863
It kinda looks like a hole,
but I'm gonna assume it's more than that

05:20.946 --> 05:22.781
-based on the way you set it up.
-Correct.

05:22.865 --> 05:27.494
This, young Gobo,
is the portal to Outer Space.

05:27.578 --> 05:28.579
What?

05:32.541 --> 05:35.085
So this is Outer Space?

05:35.919 --> 05:36.920
Gobo.

05:37.004 --> 05:39.089
Look at me. Look right at me.

05:39.173 --> 05:41.258
-Well, I feel like I am.
-Look at me.

05:41.341 --> 05:44.094
-Look right into my eyes, directly.
-I'm looking literally at you.

05:44.178 --> 05:46.847
This is serious, Gobo.
Show me you're paying attention.

05:46.930 --> 05:49.766
I don't know what else I can do.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.351
Boop noses with me.

05:52.352 --> 05:54.021
'Kay.

05:54.104 --> 05:55.814
Boop.

05:55.898 --> 05:58.942
Gobo, come with me to Outer Space.

05:59.026 --> 06:01.862
Wh-- You're joking!

06:01.945 --> 06:05.324
Well, I'm an explorer, Gobo,
not some kind of goofbug.

06:06.909 --> 06:07.910
So, what do you say?

06:07.993 --> 06:12.331
Well, I say you'll never meet
a Fraggle who's more hardworking,

06:12.414 --> 06:15.709
or loyal, or brave…

06:20.756 --> 06:24.801
I guess Outer Space
can be a scary place.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.553
That rhymes.

06:29.932 --> 06:31.308
Hey, Sprocket.

06:33.268 --> 06:35.687
Sprocket, what is it?

06:36.688 --> 06:39.525
A giant hole right in the middle
of the wall.

06:39.608 --> 06:42.444
Landlord did not bother
to cover that up.

06:42.528 --> 06:45.656
But that's okay. That's what I get
on a grad student budget.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.700
Big things are gonna happen here.

06:48.784 --> 06:50.452
I can feel it.

06:52.371 --> 06:55.624
Someday there's gonna be
a plaque on this back house that says,

06:55.707 --> 07:00.212
"Here's where Doc worked for her doctorate
in marine ecosystems and saved the ocean,

07:00.295 --> 07:02.756
earning her the nickname 'Doctor Doc.'"

07:03.590 --> 07:04.842
Yeah, we can work on that.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.426
We have time.

07:06.510 --> 07:07.845
You thirsty, buddy?

07:17.729 --> 07:19.773
Just some move-in hiccups.

07:20.399 --> 07:24.570
Janky pipes, giant hole,
vague boat smell.

07:27.656 --> 07:29.366
Easy, big bud.

07:29.449 --> 07:33.120
I'm sure there's nothing too exciting
happening on the other side of that wall.

07:34.121 --> 07:35.581
This is so exciting!

07:35.664 --> 07:38.667
I have to do my dive!

07:38.750 --> 07:42.671
I think Matt would rather I just gave
the people what they want. Yeah!

07:42.754 --> 07:45.424
Who's ready?

07:45.966 --> 07:47.301
I am, Red.

07:47.384 --> 07:48.385
Hi, Red!

07:48.468 --> 07:53.557
I've said hi a lot of times
to you today, Pogey, but, hi again.

07:53.640 --> 07:54.850
-Hi!
-Okay!

07:54.933 --> 07:56.768
Silence, please.

07:56.852 --> 08:00.314
-Everyone be quiet.
-Full concentration.

08:00.397 --> 08:02.149
Body is a machine.

08:02.232 --> 08:03.275
I know it!

08:03.901 --> 08:07.571
Three, two, one…

08:07.654 --> 08:09.323
Outer Space!

08:09.948 --> 08:14.244
Portal, scary, hairy, monster!

08:17.789 --> 08:19.583
No!

08:19.666 --> 08:21.543
Are you okay?

08:22.961 --> 08:24.046
I'm okay.

08:24.129 --> 08:27.382
Sorry about your--
your buildings, Doozers.

08:27.466 --> 08:29.676
We got a class-5 belly flop here.

08:30.344 --> 08:32.011
Class-5 belly flop.

08:32.095 --> 08:33.597
Class-5 belly flop.

08:33.679 --> 08:35.390
Class-5 belly flop.

08:36.140 --> 08:38.059
Class-5 belly flop.

08:38.559 --> 08:39.852
Class-5 belly flop.

08:41.480 --> 08:42.940
Class-5 belly flop.

08:43.023 --> 08:45.859
A C-5BF. That is serious.

08:45.943 --> 08:47.611
What do you think, Cotterpin?

08:47.694 --> 08:53.242
Well, sir, we could work extra hard
and rebuild the whole thing.

08:54.409 --> 08:57.287
Work extra hard
and rebuild the whole thing.

08:57.371 --> 08:58.372
-Yes!
-Yes!

08:58.455 --> 09:00.374
Work extra hard
and rebuild the whole thing.

09:00.457 --> 09:03.669
Work extra hard
and rebuild the whole thing.

09:03.752 --> 09:07.089
Work next to Carl
and refill the bowl king?

09:07.756 --> 09:11.343
Work next to Carl
and refill the bowl king.

09:12.010 --> 09:13.720
Who's Carl?

09:13.804 --> 09:15.722
-Gobo.
-What?

09:15.806 --> 09:19.852
You better have a good excuse
for ruining my dive.

09:19.935 --> 09:22.855
A giant space beast tried to eat me.

09:23.856 --> 09:25.899
Okay, that's a good excuse.

09:25.983 --> 09:27.776
-Yeah.
-There you are.

09:27.860 --> 09:32.656
Gobo, you're the finest nephew
an iconic uncle could possibly have.

09:32.739 --> 09:34.199
-Well…
-However,

09:34.283 --> 09:37.911
after seeing your reaction to Outer Space,

09:37.995 --> 09:40.372
I realized it's not for everyone.

09:40.455 --> 09:41.582
What?

09:41.665 --> 09:46.378
I, of course, am unique in my ability
to handle it, so I'll go alone.

09:46.879 --> 09:49.339
Just me and my boots, yes.

09:51.216 --> 09:53.552
Thank you, madam.

09:53.635 --> 09:56.513
And you may have also noticed
I'm not even wearing my…

09:56.597 --> 09:59.725
…trusty explorer's backpack.

10:01.143 --> 10:03.645
What happened to your backpack, Matt?

10:03.729 --> 10:06.064
A great question from the crowd.

10:06.148 --> 10:07.900
Why, the other day,

10:07.983 --> 10:13.030
I was exploring the fabulously dangerous
Crevice of Solitude.

10:16.658 --> 10:20.370
An ordinary Fraggle
would have been terrified, but not me.

10:23.040 --> 10:26.418
I simply was having the time of my life.

10:28.629 --> 10:32.799
Unfortunately, in all the fun,
I got separated from my backpack.

10:38.514 --> 10:41.266
So I made a calculated explorer's decision

10:41.350 --> 10:45.771
to move on without it
and calmly exited the crevice.

10:52.361 --> 10:56.198
I'd go back and retrieve it,
but you know what they say,

10:56.281 --> 10:59.743
an explorer never goes back.

10:59.826 --> 11:01.828
Who says that?

11:02.371 --> 11:05.415
Why, nearly everyone, Red.

11:05.499 --> 11:07.626
Now, if you'll excuse me, young Gobo,

11:07.709 --> 11:11.964
I need to prepare to go
to Outer Space alone.

11:15.884 --> 11:18.512
-Madam.
-But, Uncle Ma--

11:24.101 --> 11:26.353
Here he is.

11:30.315 --> 11:31.817
Are you okay, Gobo?

11:32.568 --> 11:37.906
Yeah. I just can't believe
I freaked out in front of Uncle Matt.

11:37.990 --> 11:40.534
I know I'm brave.

11:40.617 --> 11:43.412
I just had a passing moment
of being scared.

11:44.288 --> 11:46.456
In my defense, I was encountering

11:46.540 --> 11:49.418
the most ferocious creature
in the known universe.

11:49.501 --> 11:52.254
Who's my peanut butter biscuit boy?

11:52.337 --> 11:53.505
I just wish there was

11:53.589 --> 11:56.633
a way to prove to my uncle
I actually am adventurer material.

11:56.717 --> 12:01.054
Well, you could always go
to the fabulously dangerous

12:01.138 --> 12:04.183
Crevice of Solitude
and get his backpack back.

12:04.266 --> 12:06.643
That would prove it.

12:06.727 --> 12:08.312
Easy and fun.

12:08.395 --> 12:09.897
Red! That's brilliant!

12:10.772 --> 12:12.441
That's what I'll do.

12:12.524 --> 12:15.360
Then he'll have to see me
as a brave adventurer.

12:15.444 --> 12:18.488
No. Wait. I was joking.

12:18.572 --> 12:20.240
-Not a real suggestion.
-No, it's--

12:20.324 --> 12:22.784
The Crevice of Solitude
is really dangerous.

12:22.868 --> 12:25.579
-Yeah.
-Knock it off! You're not going!

12:25.662 --> 12:27.873
No. Gobo go-go.

12:27.956 --> 12:30.292
Now, how many fancy hats
should I bring?

12:30.375 --> 12:32.085
-What are we--
-Guys, guys.

12:32.169 --> 12:34.213
-Back here. Come here, come here.
-Okay.

12:34.296 --> 12:38.258
Okay, we're gonna have to convince Gobo
to let us come with him.

12:38.342 --> 12:41.178
He's determined to prove
to his uncle how brave he is,

12:41.261 --> 12:43.722
so we're gonna have to be sneaky.

12:43.805 --> 12:45.307
-Okay.
-Follow my lead.

12:45.390 --> 12:47.476
Okay.

12:50.521 --> 12:51.939
I meant my example.

12:52.022 --> 12:53.482
Hey, Gobe, we're back!

12:53.565 --> 12:56.443
Back from where?
You were just whispering over there.

12:57.778 --> 13:00.280
So, wouldn't it be extra brave

13:00.364 --> 13:04.284
if you led less brave explorers like us
to the Crevice?

13:04.368 --> 13:06.411
Your uncle would think
you're double brave.

13:06.495 --> 13:08.914
-Triple.
-Possibly quadruple-duple.

13:08.997 --> 13:10.165
Not a word.

13:10.249 --> 13:14.002
You know what? You're right.
Yeah, that's the bravest thing I could do.

13:14.086 --> 13:15.796
All right, everyone.

13:15.879 --> 13:19.132
Off we Go-bo.

13:19.216 --> 13:23.011
Little trail humor.
Little snack for the road. Okay, let's go!

13:23.095 --> 13:24.972
-Yeah.
-Here we go!

13:25.055 --> 13:28.559
Off on our brave adventure.

13:29.226 --> 13:31.979
-Our journey begins in the Gorgs' garden.
-Yeah!

13:32.062 --> 13:36.567
Just so I got this right, guys.
We are talking about the Gorgs,

13:36.650 --> 13:39.444
as in the giants
who are trying to squash us?

13:40.571 --> 13:41.989
We're all right with that?

13:42.072 --> 13:43.824
Let's go!

13:44.867 --> 13:46.326
-Yeah!
-Yeah. Okay.

13:46.410 --> 13:48.745
Okay. You're all very casual about this.

13:48.829 --> 13:50.831
Why don't the Gorgs like Fraggles?

13:50.914 --> 13:52.332
Fraggles are the best.

13:52.416 --> 13:55.043
Fraggles are the worst.

13:56.712 --> 13:59.798
No such thing
as a good Fraggle. Unacceptable.

13:59.882 --> 14:03.635
They steal all of our radishes.

14:03.719 --> 14:07.014
You know what I say, see a Fraggle,

14:07.097 --> 14:09.641
-thump a Fraggle.
-Thump a Fraggle.

14:11.143 --> 14:12.561
Junior!

14:13.270 --> 14:15.022
Thump them Fraggles!

14:24.448 --> 14:28.410
Watch for Fraggles
And don't get distracted

14:28.493 --> 14:29.494
Watch for--

14:29.578 --> 14:31.663
A flutterfly.

14:31.747 --> 14:35.083
Hey. Where you goin'? Come here.

14:35.167 --> 14:36.752
Okay, come on, let's go.

14:36.835 --> 14:38.587
I wanna be your friend.

14:40.422 --> 14:43.383
There you go. Where you going?
Come back here!

14:44.760 --> 14:46.595
Okay, now's our chance.

14:46.678 --> 14:48.972
Now, I'll lead the way,
because I'm the leader.

14:49.056 --> 14:50.265
Careful, Gobo.

14:50.349 --> 14:52.684
Those leaves look loud and crunchy.

14:52.768 --> 14:54.895
Thanks, Red.

14:54.978 --> 14:57.523
I appreciate you.
But I am the leader, so…

15:01.109 --> 15:03.695
-Oh, boy.
-Fraggles.

15:03.779 --> 15:07.407
-Yeah, Fraggles!
-Run!

15:09.743 --> 15:11.370
Wembley!

15:12.663 --> 15:14.915
I'm gonna get you! I'm gonna get you all.

15:18.961 --> 15:19.795
Yeah.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.507
Be the noodle.

15:24.466 --> 15:25.592
-Where did you go?
-Follow me.

15:25.676 --> 15:28.095
-Follow me. Let's go!
-What happened to you, Fraggle?

15:28.178 --> 15:29.930
No, no, no!

15:30.013 --> 15:31.473
No, no!

15:32.182 --> 15:35.269
Flutterfly, you're back.

15:35.352 --> 15:37.896
-Up here! Come up here!
-Go, go!

15:37.980 --> 15:39.398
Look out! Look out! Look out!

15:48.615 --> 15:51.076
What is this, some kind of dump?

15:51.159 --> 15:55.789
I beg your pardon,
not just any kind of dump.

15:58.417 --> 16:01.420
You are in the presence of…

16:01.503 --> 16:03.380
The all-knowing…

16:03.463 --> 16:04.923
Trash Heap!

16:06.925 --> 16:09.469
-Thank you, boys.
-Sure thing.

16:09.553 --> 16:13.056
Humbled to be in your presence,
Your Trashiness.

16:13.140 --> 16:16.185
Did you say humbled or hungry?

16:16.268 --> 16:19.563
Because if you're hungry,
the boys will share their trash cheese.

16:19.646 --> 16:21.732
Come on, Marjory!

16:21.815 --> 16:24.359
Yeah, I'm keeping
the moldy parts for myself.

16:24.443 --> 16:26.820
-Take some cheese. Go ahead.
-No, thank you.

16:26.904 --> 16:29.239
-It's good. You look hungry.
-I just ate.

16:29.323 --> 16:31.325
I had a radish on the way here. I'm good.

16:31.408 --> 16:34.119
-I'll try some. Yeah.
-All right, here you go.

16:34.203 --> 16:35.704
Thank you, sir.

16:37.915 --> 16:41.752
You know, it's--
I'll just save it for later.

16:41.835 --> 16:46.131
Yeah. Madam Trash Heap,
what an honor.

16:46.215 --> 16:48.800
I mean, you are a remarkable, wise being,

16:48.884 --> 16:51.303
and I'm gonna savor
every moment I get with you.

16:52.429 --> 16:55.057
-Well, gotta go.
-What's the hurry?

16:55.140 --> 16:57.893
-You got a soup on the stove?
-I wish.

16:57.976 --> 17:02.189
Well, I need to bravely lead
my friends to the Crevice of Solitude.

17:02.272 --> 17:04.191
The Crevice?

17:04.273 --> 17:07.444
-Yeah. He is leading us bravely.
-Yeah.

17:07.528 --> 17:09.154
-Dangerous.
-Spooky.

17:09.238 --> 17:11.365
-Scary.
-Mildewy.

17:11.448 --> 17:15.493
I know. Right? I gotta go there to get
my Uncle Travelling Matt's backpack,

17:15.577 --> 17:18.038
so I can prove I'm a brave explorer.

17:22.917 --> 17:23.877
She's thinking.

17:25.587 --> 17:28.382
I'm so sorry. It's very dry.

17:28.464 --> 17:30.717
I feel like a fire hazard.

17:30.801 --> 17:34.054
Let me ask you,
why do you want to explore?

17:34.137 --> 17:38.684
Well--
'Cause, you know, to be brave.

17:39.768 --> 17:43.939
So, you wanna prove
you're brave enough to explore,

17:44.022 --> 17:46.942
so that you can explore to be brave?

17:47.734 --> 17:51.029
Well, yeah!

17:51.113 --> 17:53.073
You know what I think?

17:53.156 --> 17:59.204
I think you need to dig deeper.

18:00.539 --> 18:03.876
The Trash Heap has spoken!

18:10.007 --> 18:13.594
That was powerful. Dig deeper.

18:13.677 --> 18:16.847
-Let's all just breathe.
-Well, long trip ahead. Let's go.

18:16.930 --> 18:20.893
And just reflect on what we just heard--
Okay.

18:26.732 --> 18:30.319
Heading down the road
I'm going round and round

18:31.028 --> 18:35.115
Walking through the light
And through the free and easy land

18:35.199 --> 18:37.284
Come on, everybody. Let's go!

18:37.367 --> 18:41.788
All I want to know
Is how the world goes round

18:41.872 --> 18:45.292
All I want to be is a traveling
Be a wandering man

18:45.375 --> 18:49.213
Well, you go one way
See it's some kinda fun way

18:49.296 --> 18:53.717
Start exploring the two-way
Wow, it's just like a thruway

18:53.800 --> 18:57.971
When you get to the three-way
Can't be sure it's a freeway

18:58.055 --> 19:01.892
Got to find me the true way
That's the only way home

19:03.060 --> 19:04.603
Wembley!

19:04.686 --> 19:08.398
Well, you go one way
See it's some kinda fun way

19:08.482 --> 19:12.986
Start exploring the two-way
Wow, it's just like a thruway

19:13.070 --> 19:17.449
When you get to the three-way
Can't be sure it's a freeway

19:17.533 --> 19:21.537
Got to find me the true way
That's the only way home

19:31.338 --> 19:33.090
Hey, Gobo, I think we're here.

19:33.173 --> 19:35.050
Hey, you know these guys?

19:35.676 --> 19:37.427
Let's see.

19:39.471 --> 19:40.806
This is it!

19:40.889 --> 19:42.057
The Crevice.

19:50.232 --> 19:51.942
You did it, buddy!

19:52.025 --> 19:55.070
Gobo! Gobo! Gobo…

19:55.153 --> 19:58.115
Nobody wants to chant?
Let me know if that changes.

19:58.198 --> 20:01.952
Look! Uncle Matt's backpack,
on that barely balanced rock.

20:02.035 --> 20:05.455
"Barely balanced rock."
This is it!

20:05.539 --> 20:09.376
Be careful! It could tip this way.

20:09.459 --> 20:12.045
Or that way. Or the other way.
Or the other, other way!

20:16.508 --> 20:17.801
There it is.

20:20.804 --> 20:21.805
Almost there.

20:21.889 --> 20:23.765
-Steady.
-Almost got it.

20:23.849 --> 20:25.726
-I'm okay.
-Wait!

20:25.809 --> 20:27.436
-No.
-No!

20:28.395 --> 20:31.481
No! Look out below!

20:31.565 --> 20:33.984
I live for new experiences,
but not this one!

20:34.067 --> 20:37.446
I've got you, Gobo!

20:51.543 --> 20:54.129
This day just keeps getting worse,

20:54.213 --> 20:55.297
which I respect.

20:56.548 --> 20:57.549
Well, it's honest.

20:57.633 --> 21:00.260
Why did I just grab it like that?

21:00.344 --> 21:04.264
Now I got us stuck, maybe forever.

21:04.348 --> 21:05.349
Or longer.

21:05.933 --> 21:07.851
Everyone just wanted to help,

21:07.935 --> 21:11.772
but I've been too busy trying to prove
I'm a brave explorer to listen.

21:13.565 --> 21:17.402
Maybe the Trash Heap was right.
Maybe I do need to dig deeper.

21:18.570 --> 21:20.030
Yes, deeper!

21:20.113 --> 21:21.573
Start with your breath.

21:21.657 --> 21:25.494
Connect to it,
follow it down to the source within.

21:25.577 --> 21:29.790
Yeah, but,
maybe she also meant literally dig deeper.

21:33.919 --> 21:36.755
Hey, hey,
I think there's something behind here.

21:36.839 --> 21:39.091
Come on, Wembley. Look at this here.

21:39.174 --> 21:42.553
I think I hear something.
Come here. Come on. Come on.

21:42.636 --> 21:45.639
-A little bit more.
-I don't like this.

21:46.348 --> 21:47.182
Is that…

21:47.266 --> 21:49.142
-Water!
-Water!

21:58.443 --> 22:00.112
Make it stop!

22:04.157 --> 22:07.619
I am the water, and the water is me.

22:26.180 --> 22:27.014
Wembley!

22:28.515 --> 22:30.392
Make it stop!

22:30.934 --> 22:33.103
-We're home!
-Oh, my goodness.

22:33.187 --> 22:35.606
Wh-- Wh-- Where's Red?

22:42.905 --> 22:47.159
There's a twist, a tuck, a flip,

22:47.242 --> 22:48.911
and a flup!

22:51.163 --> 22:51.997
Red!

22:52.080 --> 22:54.625
Look at all this new water!

22:54.708 --> 22:55.542
Yeah!

23:02.883 --> 23:05.219
Water, water, yeah!

23:05.928 --> 23:11.266
The garden!
Let's see the garden!

23:11.350 --> 23:15.020
Yes, yes, yes!
More water for the garden!

23:15.103 --> 23:18.690
More water means more radishes!

23:21.068 --> 23:23.070
Look at all this water.

23:23.153 --> 23:27.199
The power has doubled
and tripled and bippled!

23:28.408 --> 23:30.077
Cotterpin, you know what this means?

23:30.160 --> 23:34.456
More power means there's no limit
to what we can build!

23:34.540 --> 23:37.251
What a historic moment!

23:37.334 --> 23:40.379
Everyone, four-second celebration.

23:44.550 --> 23:46.885
-All right, that's enough. Back to work.
-Back to work.

23:46.969 --> 23:48.470
-Back to work.
-Thank you.

23:49.471 --> 23:51.348
Yes.
You think it was too long?

23:51.431 --> 23:52.474
Not at all, sir.

23:52.558 --> 23:55.310
-What fun.
-That was exhausting.

24:01.733 --> 24:04.111
Okay, okay!

24:05.195 --> 24:06.321
Okay!

24:18.250 --> 24:19.251
Okay.

24:20.544 --> 24:23.839
So this place had some first day kinks.

24:24.840 --> 24:27.134
But I think it's smooth sailing
from here on out.

24:29.553 --> 24:30.554
Still thirsty?

24:33.515 --> 24:35.809
Okay. Yeah.

24:39.062 --> 24:42.316
I think we're gonna settle in
just fine here.

24:44.234 --> 24:48.614
You are wise. You are admired.
You are cute.

24:48.697 --> 24:50.824
-You are courageous.
-Uncle Matt.

24:50.908 --> 24:52.326
Mommy! Mommy!

24:52.409 --> 24:55.120
It's you, young Gobo and friends.

24:55.204 --> 24:57.414
I was just stretching.

25:00.334 --> 25:03.420
-What can I do for you?
-We came to give you this.

25:03.504 --> 25:06.131
What? You-- You found it?

25:06.965 --> 25:08.175
Gobo, I am impressed.

25:08.258 --> 25:10.761
The Crevice of Solitude
is not for amateurs.

25:10.844 --> 25:14.890
Perhaps I was too hasty
uninviting you to Outer Space.

25:15.807 --> 25:18.143
What do you say? Come with?

25:18.227 --> 25:20.521
Well-- Wh--

25:22.105 --> 25:25.317
You know, I wanted to prove to you
I was a brave explorer.

25:25.400 --> 25:28.695
But exploring isn't
about proving something.

25:28.779 --> 25:32.574
It's about being open to discovering
new things that can help others.

25:32.658 --> 25:35.702
And I never would have figured that out
without my friends.

25:35.786 --> 25:38.789
So, I'm sorry, Uncle Matt.

25:38.872 --> 25:41.124
I cannot come with you to Outer Space.

25:41.208 --> 25:45.128
I have too much exploring
to do here with them, together.

25:46.839 --> 25:47.673
Cool.

25:48.507 --> 25:51.385
Hey! If you're staying here anyway,
here's an idea.

25:51.468 --> 25:56.557
I'll send artifacts back from Outer Space
to this portal for you to retrieve.

25:56.640 --> 26:00.227
-Think you can do that?
-Well, no.

26:00.310 --> 26:02.104
I can't do it.

26:02.187 --> 26:03.605
But we can do it.

26:04.273 --> 26:07.985
Why, after what we went through today,
we can handle whatever's out there.

26:10.821 --> 26:13.073
A little help, please!

26:13.657 --> 26:15.909
Somebody other than me do something!

26:17.828 --> 26:20.581
Eat trash cheese, space beast!

26:28.046 --> 26:29.548
You know what, Gobo?

26:29.631 --> 26:35.012
That was-- that was so nice
what you said about doing it together.

26:35.095 --> 26:36.263
Yeah.

26:36.346 --> 26:39.725
But you should be
the one to get Matt's packages.

26:39.808 --> 26:41.560
-Definitely.
-Yeah, he's your uncle.

26:41.643 --> 26:45.105
Yeah, and you're his nephew.
That's a special relationship, right?

26:45.189 --> 26:46.106
Yeah.

26:46.690 --> 26:50.986
Well, all right.
Well, safe travels, Uncle Matt.

26:54.281 --> 26:55.324
Farewell, Gobo.

26:55.866 --> 26:57.534
Boop noses?

27:06.168 --> 27:10.672
Today, it was like, we had no idea
there was water behind the Crevice,

27:10.756 --> 27:13.175
or that it flowed through the tunnels,
back to the Great Hall.

27:13.258 --> 27:14.092
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

27:14.176 --> 27:16.845
Doesn't it make you wonder
what else is out there?

27:16.929 --> 27:18.764
What else is connected?

27:45.624 --> 27:49.711
Dance your cares away
Worry's for another day

27:49.795 --> 27:53.215
Let the music play
Down at Fraggle Rock

27:53.715 --> 27:58.095
Work your cares away
Dancing's for another day

27:58.178 --> 27:59.596
Let the Fraggles play

27:59.680 --> 28:00.514
-We're Gobo.
-Mokey.

28:00.597 --> 28:01.431
-Wembley.
-Boober.

28:01.515 --> 28:02.516
Red!

28:06.019 --> 28:07.104
Junior!

28:07.187 --> 28:08.772
Hello!

28:08.856 --> 28:11.358
Aw, my radish.

28:12.693 --> 28:16.697
Dance your cares away
Worry's for another day

28:16.780 --> 28:18.198
Let the music play

28:18.949 --> 28:22.244
Down at Fraggle Rock

28:22.953 --> 28:24.454
Down at Fraggle Rock.
