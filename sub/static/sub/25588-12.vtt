09:16.973 --> 09:18.099
Hey, I did it!

09:18.182 --> 09:21.936
Yes! The nanobots give you
superior physical abilities.

09:22.019 --> 09:25.606
And you control them with my handy app,
the Nano-Limits 2000.

09:25.690 --> 09:27.490
While George and Harold
rest on their laurels,

09:27.567 --> 09:29.318
you'll sail past them to victory.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.654
- We're a genius!
- Yes, we are.

[Melvinborg] <i>You're probably wondering
why you're in a dome,</i>

09:44.041 --> 09:46.168

09:46.252 --> 09:47.452
<i>or how it was built in secret.</i>

09:47.795 --> 09:50.172
Didn't we have a Doom Dome
in one of our old comics?

and the Deadly Doom Dome"!</i>

[clears throat] <i>As I was saying,
this year we're having a final exam</i>

Great. If we fail, our grades drop.
That means no Lake Summer Camp!

10:22.747 --> 10:25.166
- We gotta win this thing!
- We were so close.

Why can't our lives ever be hard?

10:31.714 --> 10:34.467
If you give up now,
you can spare yourself the humiliation

10:34.550 --> 10:36.052
of a crushing defeat at my hands.

10:36.135 --> 10:38.471
What? You couldn't make it through
an obstacle course

10:38.554 --> 10:41.724

10:48.189 --> 10:49.815

11:02.953 --> 11:05.915
Eh, he's always up to something,
and we always beat him.

11:05.998 --> 11:07.708
Wait, that's a Meanus Guy Trap!

11:41.075 --> 11:43.369
We're dinosaurs

But if this sponsorship
doesn't drum up some biz,

11:45.704 --> 11:46.956
we'll be out of biz.

11:47.039 --> 11:48.124
[scats]

Well, at least we get to live,

They're dropping like flies.
Should we save them?

11:53.337 --> 11:54.839
From pizza? They're fine.

11:54.922 --> 11:57.591
And we gotta keep our eye
on the summer camp prize.

11:57.675 --> 11:59.718
Oh, yeah.
I forgot that's our goal for the season.

11:59.802 --> 12:01.887
But we thought up this dome,
so we're golden.

12:01.971 --> 12:04.598
There's a big difference
between fantasy and reality.

12:04.682 --> 12:07.309
For example, pushing the red button's
a fantasy for you guys.

12:07.393 --> 12:08.936
For me, it's reality.

Yep. Too bad those guys don't.

Don't forget to close your mouths.

12:47.475 --> 12:49.768
Hey, he unsproinged himself!

12:49.852 --> 12:52.855
- Don't worry. That's just dome luck.
- [chuckles] Nice.

12:53.147 --> 12:56.066
Now that I'm up here,
I hope the birds accept me as one of them.

12:58.652 --> 13:00.696
[scats] My insurance won't cover that!

13:00.779 --> 13:04.074
I'm startin' to think
this was a bad idea. [scats]

Oh, they totally nailed
the dirty-tube-socks part of the stink.

- Why does he keep checking his phone?
- Maybe he's watching fitness videos.

These stairs are jacked
and they smell like a van.

Fingers is one shifty panther.
We gotta stay frosty.

Yeah. He's never been able
to pick up panthers before.

18:33.779 --> 18:35.864
and that other nest, and... Oh, no.

18:35.948 --> 18:37.783
[groans] I'm better than this.

18:42.830 --> 18:46.917
Ah, finally! A place
where I can eat pizza in peace!

18:47.376 --> 18:48.460
- Mr. Krupp!
- [screams]

18:48.544 --> 18:50.462
Occupied! <i>Ocupado!</i> Why didn't you knock?

18:50.546 --> 18:52.965
- Ah! Why didn't you lock the door?
- I don't know how!

18:53.132 --> 18:55.217
And why are you eating pizza
in the bathroom?

18:55.300 --> 18:59.680
[sobs] Because I can't stop myself,
and I have a problem, and please help me!

18:59.763 --> 19:00.764
[blows nose]

19:00.848 --> 19:04.726
- We don't have time. [snaps fingers]
- <i>♪ Tra-la-lavatory ♪</i>

19:07.479 --> 19:09.815
Whoa! Is that a pizza tree?

19:09.898 --> 19:12.651
[humming]

19:12.734 --> 19:15.487
"This toilet brought to you
by Piquasaurus Pizza."

19:17.406 --> 19:18.657
"Buy our Butt Pizza."

19:18.740 --> 19:20.075
- [both laughing]
- So good.

19:20.159 --> 19:23.162
Yeah, but we better get back
to beating NanoNerd to that button.

19:23.245 --> 19:25.455
You can't beat me!

19:25.539 --> 19:27.833
Nano-one can!

19:27.916 --> 19:29.418
Look, talking parade balloon,

19:29.501 --> 19:34.423
I've got a pizza tree to harvest,
so let's settle this mano-a-nano! Ha!

19:34.506 --> 19:37.176
[narrator] <i>Chapter 6: The Incredibly Graphic Violence Chapter,</i>

19:37.259 --> 19:39.052
<i>presented in Pizza-O-Rama.</i>

19:39.136 --> 19:42.306
<i>Because fighting is violent,
but pizza is delicious.</i>

19:42.389 --> 19:44.949
[Diddlysaurus] Got a half
Captain Underpants, half NanoNerd here,

19:45.017 --> 19:45.851
and it's pipin' hot!

19:45.934 --> 19:48.312
Oh! Maybe too hot! [scats]

19:48.395 --> 19:51.648
This one's quarter shredded brief,
three-quarters glasses and bowties.

19:51.732 --> 19:55.569
Whoa! Those nerd toppings
got a beef with those briefs! [scats]

19:55.652 --> 19:58.739
Last call on a Nerdvana Supreme
with undies hangin' by a thread.

19:58.822 --> 20:01.325
Game over, undies! [scats]

20:02.284 --> 20:04.786
[grunts] Pizza. Need pizza.

20:07.706 --> 20:10.876
I'm getting some pep from this pepperoni!

20:11.543 --> 20:12.920
[grunting]

20:13.879 --> 20:16.048
More pizza, extra cheese.

20:17.341 --> 20:18.341
Aha!

20:18.967 --> 20:20.469
Whoa! [grunts]

20:20.552 --> 20:23.639
- Maybe a Hawaiian...
- Pizza's not working! Time to go!

20:23.722 --> 20:25.641
[screams]

20:25.724 --> 20:27.893
Just keep moving.
We'll lose him in the trees.

20:27.976 --> 20:32.397
Hey, a Punt Force Mama tour jacket
attached to a wire.

20:32.481 --> 20:35.400
- Cool!
- No! That's a trap from our comic!

20:36.735 --> 20:41.657
Hey, did everything just get real slow?

20:41.740 --> 20:47.246
[in slow-mo] I mean, real slow.

20:47.329 --> 20:51.124
- Oh, Drowsy Darts! What were we thinking?
- Yeah, not our best work.

20:51.208 --> 20:52.376
But no time for naps!

20:52.459 --> 20:54.670
I don't know how long
Fingers can stall NanoNerd!

20:54.753 --> 20:55.963
Is this your card?

20:56.046 --> 20:57.631
For the last time, no!

20:57.714 --> 21:00.759
- Okay, but is this your watch? [laughing]
- [growls]

21:04.471 --> 21:08.016
- A cliff! We're out of runway!
- Shh! I think we lost him.

21:09.226 --> 21:12.688
Never fear, I'll find him!

21:12.771 --> 21:14.189
Here, Nano! NanoNerd!

21:14.273 --> 21:16.817
- [boys] No, wait!
- Nano? Found him!

21:18.026 --> 21:20.070
- [both scream]
- It's over.

21:20.153 --> 21:22.906
After I leave you stranded
in that eagle's nest,

21:22.990 --> 21:24.074
I'll push the red button

21:24.157 --> 21:27.411
and I'll be going to Eliteanati Academy
instead of you!

21:27.494 --> 21:29.871
Wait! We don't wanna go to Eliteanati!

21:29.955 --> 21:32.165
We were just pranking you
for calling us dumb!

21:32.249 --> 21:34.543
Yeah, we just wanna go
to Lake Summer Camp!

21:34.626 --> 21:35.794
- Really?
- [both] Really!

21:35.877 --> 21:38.714
Hey, guys! I just found some dirt pizza.

21:38.797 --> 21:41.717
[crunching] Oh, you know what?
Wait a minute. This is just dirt.

21:41.925 --> 21:43.510
Why didn't you say that earlier?

21:43.593 --> 21:45.429
We were busy tryin' to stay alive.

21:45.512 --> 21:47.889
So, if you guys go to Lake Summer Camp,

21:47.973 --> 21:50.309
you won't go to Eliteanati
and we'll part ways forever?

21:50.392 --> 21:51.560
- Sure.
- Deal!

21:52.102 --> 21:54.229
- Really?
- Of course. I'm not a monster...

21:54.313 --> 21:56.606
[grunting]

21:57.357 --> 21:58.817
[screaming]

21:59.484 --> 22:01.653
You just electro-blasted yourself.

22:01.737 --> 22:02.821
I had no choice.

22:02.904 --> 22:06.033
But we're safe now,
thanks to my NanoWayJose 2000.

22:06.116 --> 22:09.745
It was the only way to halt the nanobot
epidemic you unleashed in young me

22:09.828 --> 22:11.388
by turning the nanobots all the way up.

22:11.455 --> 22:14.666
If turning them all the way up does that,
why is it even an option?

22:14.750 --> 22:16.877
And why'd you even build a dome
that was our idea?

22:17.210 --> 22:21.214
Mistakes were made. Lots of mistakes.
Plenty of blame to go around.

22:21.298 --> 22:23.425
But the point is
I got rid of the nanobots.

22:23.508 --> 22:27.846
Unless, of course, the shock chased them
into a new host, like the dome, but...

22:28.555 --> 22:31.808
Look, there's only
a four percent chance of that.

22:32.601 --> 22:33.601
Oh, no.

22:37.189 --> 22:40.233
Man, if I was gonna do a cliffhanger,
I'd do it right here.

22:40.317 --> 22:41.317
[narrator] <i>So would we.</i>
