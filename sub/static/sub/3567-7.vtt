Episode 4a
"Bubble buddies"

00:32.960 --> 00:35.710
I don't think they are earthquakes,
they are too frequent.

00:36.500 --> 00:38.930
Hey, look, Steven's got a bike.

00:39.300 --> 00:40.510
Where are you going, Steven?

00:40.770 --> 00:41.930
Just our for a ride.

00:42.190 --> 00:43.230
In the sand?

00:43.660 --> 00:44.130
Yup.

00:59.130 --> 01:00.330
Some smooth ride.

01:02.640 --> 01:03.650
Five speeds...

01:04.959 --> 01:06.070
Handbrakes...

01:07.230 --> 01:09.940
Electric-blue finish
with the tiger bell.

01:13.590 --> 01:16.290
I bet there are lot of kids who
would love to ride this babe.

01:28.210 --> 01:28.740
What up?

01:29.610 --> 01:31.400
Who were you talking to?

01:32.600 --> 01:33.450
That girl.

01:33.880 --> 01:34.650
You saw?

01:35.080 --> 01:38.300
She is just a girl I know.
Except she doesn't know me.

01:39.220 --> 01:40.530
We've never talked.

01:41.240 --> 01:42.600
You like her!

01:43.640 --> 01:44.900
I like everyone.

01:45.170 --> 01:46.550
Let's set up a play date.

01:46.720 --> 01:49.310
I'll write up an invitation
and work out a schedule.

01:49.450 --> 01:52.140
Oh, we'll have to find out
her favorite kind of tea...

01:52.160 --> 01:54.080
No. Just talk to her.

01:54.370 --> 01:57.040
Okay. But you guys
can't watch this time!

01:57.270 --> 01:58.790
It'll mess up my funky flow!

01:59.190 --> 02:00.550
Funky flow?

02:00.900 --> 02:02.160
We won't watch.

02:02.360 --> 02:02.820
All right.

02:05.540 --> 02:06.360
What's that?

02:06.380 --> 02:06.860
Nothing.

02:09.600 --> 02:11.600
Hi! My name is Steven.

02:12.340 --> 02:14.380
Hi! My name is Steven.

02:15.220 --> 02:17.610
Hi! My name is... Stephen.

02:24.050 --> 02:25.790
Hey! My name is Steven!

02:32.150 --> 02:33.480
How did I do that?

02:34.110 --> 02:37.250
Hi! My name... is Steven!

02:38.390 --> 02:39.020
Connie.

02:39.850 --> 02:41.700
What... happened?

02:42.530 --> 02:45.540
I'm magic. Well, half-magic -
I'm my mom's son.

02:46.010 --> 02:47.060
You did this?

02:47.390 --> 02:48.200
Apparently.

02:48.770 --> 02:52.120
I'm a member of the Crystal Gems, we fight
monsters and protect humanity and stuff.

02:52.610 --> 02:55.210
Oh, that's kinda like
my dad. He's a cop.

02:55.920 --> 02:58.890
Well, more like
a private security guard.

03:02.490 --> 03:06.010
Sooo... how long does it usually last?

03:06.210 --> 03:07.600
Oh, right.

03:13.540 --> 03:14.720
What's wrong?

03:15.110 --> 03:18.600
It, uhh... doesn't seem
to wanna go away.

03:19.010 --> 03:19.760
Oh...

03:24.490 --> 03:26.490
So, I don't see you around that often.

03:26.810 --> 03:29.220
My dad works for a
bunch of different beaches,

03:29.220 --> 03:31.440
so we are never in
the same place long.

03:31.780 --> 03:33.980
I go on adventures with
the Gems sometimes.

03:34.280 --> 03:36.280
They usually say it's too
dangerous for me though.

03:39.420 --> 03:41.060
Do you always go in a bubble?

03:41.550 --> 03:44.710
No. This is new.
I don't know what this is.

03:45.070 --> 03:47.340
But it's okay! The Gems
will know what to do.

03:51.300 --> 03:52.790
Ohh, what?

03:55.700 --> 03:59.860
Hey, guys! Garnet, help!

04:01.560 --> 04:03.240
I don't think they can hear you.

04:03.780 --> 04:07.190
Oh, that's right.
I told them not to watch.

04:07.570 --> 04:09.740
We can just wait here
until they come out.

04:09.760 --> 04:12.540
No, no, no, it's okay!
I've got other friends that can help!

04:15.810 --> 04:19.370
Way to go, Steven. Is this your
magic love bubble or something?

04:19.570 --> 04:23.170
Did you make it because you love...

04:23.650 --> 04:26.270
That's Lars. We are basically BFFs.

04:26.610 --> 04:28.010
He makes weird faces.

04:32.260 --> 04:34.260
Lars, quit being a jerk and help!

04:34.470 --> 04:36.470
What? I'm helping Steven on his date.

04:36.550 --> 04:37.660
You're embarrassing him.

04:37.660 --> 04:38.160
Oh, I'm not...

04:38.190 --> 04:39.890
He and Sadie run the Big Donut.

04:40.050 --> 04:41.380
Do they get along?

04:44.190 --> 04:45.770
They're crazy about each other.

04:46.280 --> 04:47.910
I'm gonna go try something else.

04:48.750 --> 04:50.750
Anyway, this place
has the best donuts.

04:51.110 --> 04:52.390
I come here like every day.

04:52.710 --> 04:56.450
My parents don't let me eat
donuts. They have trans fats.

04:56.810 --> 04:58.720
Whaaaat?

05:00.010 --> 05:02.570
Well, it's still a cool
place to hang out.

05:08.360 --> 05:09.650
I have a better idea.

05:11.690 --> 05:14.630
Whoa, a trawler.
And a little skipjack!

05:14.870 --> 05:16.280
You know a lot about boats.

05:16.430 --> 05:19.360
That's what happens when you hang
out at the beach, and don't swim,

05:19.360 --> 05:20.800
and don't have friends.

05:21.150 --> 05:22.780
Y-You look at boats.

05:24.770 --> 05:26.190
Oh, hey!

05:26.690 --> 05:28.520
Onion! Onion!

05:30.960 --> 05:32.860
We need a harpoon gun!

05:32.970 --> 05:33.680
What?

05:33.910 --> 05:34.930
To pop the bubble!

05:35.140 --> 05:37.140
Can't we just go back to your house?

05:37.360 --> 05:39.030
It's okay. I'm a Gem.

05:39.620 --> 05:42.120
Onion, we need a harpoon gun!

05:42.750 --> 05:47.180
Har... poon... guuuun!

05:54.670 --> 06:00.880
Haaaar... poooon... guuun.

06:07.590 --> 06:08.410
Let me try!

06:19.870 --> 06:21.270
It just made more sense.

06:32.460 --> 06:33.560
The trawler...

06:37.690 --> 06:38.610
Funland?

06:39.130 --> 06:42.300
Yeah! Tons of horrible accidents
happen here everyday!

06:42.620 --> 06:44.410
There's gotta be something
to break this bubble.

06:45.560 --> 06:47.180
We just gotta find the right ride.

06:47.820 --> 06:50.450
Yeah! The kiddie-coaster!

06:54.210 --> 06:57.470
All right. We just roll down this
ramp, as the carts are coming at us.

06:57.650 --> 06:59.260
And the crash will break us free!

06:59.470 --> 07:01.640
What happens after the bubble pops?

07:01.810 --> 07:02.620
We'll be free!

07:04.650 --> 07:06.510
Steven, this is a bad idea.

07:08.300 --> 07:09.440
This will work!

07:25.930 --> 07:26.990
Where are we?

07:27.310 --> 07:28.500
The bottom of the ocean.

07:29.490 --> 07:30.480
It's okay!

07:30.520 --> 07:32.620
Are we even close to the shore?

07:32.940 --> 07:34.470
Yeah, sure.

07:35.080 --> 07:36.250
Let's start rolling.

07:37.110 --> 07:41.270
It's a good thing this bubble is airtight.
Otherwise we'd be drowning right now.

07:47.010 --> 07:50.130
Don't worry, Connie. I have
an idea that will definitely work.

07:50.910 --> 07:51.920
When we get back...

07:54.520 --> 07:56.520
A huge worm!

07:57.460 --> 08:01.240
It's okay! Look! It only
wants to eat that bright stuff.

08:03.360 --> 08:05.480
See? Not scary at all!

08:18.590 --> 08:20.550
Sorry! Are you all right?

08:21.760 --> 08:22.760
It's not so bad!

08:25.010 --> 08:27.150
It-it's okay! I uh...

08:27.150 --> 08:28.660
It's not okay!

08:29.220 --> 08:32.179
You keep saying that, but you
don't know what you are doing!

08:32.260 --> 08:35.500
Now we are going to suffocate or
starve at the bottom of the ocean.

08:35.830 --> 08:39.409
And only my parents will notice,
because no one else cares about me!

08:40.450 --> 08:43.940
I'm gonna disappear without
ever making a single friend.

08:51.170 --> 08:52.260
We could be friends!

08:54.530 --> 08:56.730
I saw you at the
boardwalk parade last year.

08:57.500 --> 08:58.570
You dropped your bracelet.

08:59.600 --> 09:01.700
I picked it up, but
then I couldn't find you.

09:02.640 --> 09:04.860
I saved it in the freezer,
so it would last longer.

09:05.150 --> 09:06.380
In case I saw you again.

09:08.210 --> 09:10.210
You were the kid on the car-wash float.

09:11.440 --> 09:13.780
You had soap bubbles in your hair.

09:14.250 --> 09:16.400
I-I was supposed to be a scrub brush.

09:18.430 --> 09:19.500
I'm sorry, Connie.

09:19.780 --> 09:21.780
If I'd have returned
your bracelet back then,

09:22.320 --> 09:24.450
you wouldn't be stuck
in this bubble with me now.

09:24.970 --> 09:27.650
No, it's okay. I'm having fun.

09:52.410 --> 09:53.780
Come on, come on!

09:55.180 --> 09:56.770
Hide in the rocks, Steven!

09:58.760 --> 10:00.170
Why is it chasing us?

10:02.550 --> 10:04.970
The bracelet!
It eats bright stuff!

10:05.650 --> 10:06.410
Connie!

10:07.500 --> 10:08.600
Steven!

10:08.600 --> 10:09.610
Give me the bracelet!

10:09.610 --> 10:10.280
What?

10:10.480 --> 10:14.450
It's okay! Now, go!
Go! Run that way!

10:16.080 --> 10:16.810
I'm sorry!

10:38.300 --> 10:39.130
Steven!

10:41.140 --> 10:43.950
Steven! What's going on?
What did you do?

10:44.480 --> 10:46.170
It was incredible!

10:46.450 --> 10:47.830
Really? You mean it?

10:49.160 --> 10:51.300
Here's your bracelet... again.

10:51.500 --> 10:52.470
Thanks!

10:53.420 --> 10:56.280
So, are you going to introduce us?

10:56.360 --> 11:00.020
Steven was so excited to meet you!
Right, Steven?

11:02.090 --> 11:04.290
Hey! Don't mess with his funky flow!

11:05.550 --> 11:07.740
Funky... flow?
