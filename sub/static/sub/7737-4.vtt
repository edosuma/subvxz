00:13.800 --> 00:15.833

[gunshot]

00:15.867 --> 00:17.667
- Whatever you're going through
we're going through together.

00:17.700 --> 00:19.033
- I love you.

00:19.067 --> 00:20.900
- I'm a Collaborator, Katie.

00:20.933 --> 00:23.400
- You are protecting
our family.

00:23.433 --> 00:25.867
- Our choice is clear,
my friends.

00:25.900 --> 00:27.667
Resist or die.

00:27.700 --> 00:29.267
- There's a woman
running a unit.

00:29.300 --> 00:31.567
I've seen her type before
when I was deployed.

00:31.600 --> 00:32.833
Ex-CIA, if I had to guess.

00:32.867 --> 00:34.500
- Tell Katie her intel

00:34.533 --> 00:37.700
needs to outweigh the damage
that her husband is doing to us.

00:37.733 --> 00:40.267
- They have this huge database
of information

00:40.300 --> 00:41.600
and more importantly,
they have a woman

00:41.633 --> 00:43.100
who knows how to manipulate it.

00:43.133 --> 00:44.400
- Who is she?

00:44.433 --> 00:46.000
- First I want to make a deal.

00:46.033 --> 00:48.467
My husband
is never harmed, ever.

man.

00:57.600 --> 00:59.267
- No, no, no, no,
you're always complaining.

00:59.300 --> 01:00.667
- What's up, Dee?
- What's up?

01:00.700 --> 01:01.967
- Dee, you gonna smile today,
huh?

01:04.300 --> 01:06.967
- * Bad boys, bad boys,
what you gonna do *

01:07.067 --> 01:08.900
* What you gonna do
when they come for you *

01:08.933 --> 01:10.467
[giggles]

01:10.500 --> 01:12.900
- He sings the same stupid song
every single day.

01:12.933 --> 01:14.833
- I just think
that they should make a show

01:14.867 --> 01:16.667
about us,
busting down doors

01:16.700 --> 01:18.967
and kicking ass.

01:19.067 --> 01:21.967
- [sighs]
- What do you think, Dee?

01:22.067 --> 01:23.567
[bell rings]
- Against the wall.

01:23.600 --> 01:25.067
- We're looking
for Marla Nelson.

01:25.067 --> 01:27.500
- Room 201.
- This way.

01:27.533 --> 01:31.300

- Stay seated--sit down!

01:34.300 --> 01:37.100
- What's going on?
- You need to come with us.

01:37.133 --> 01:38.767
- Why? What for?

01:38.800 --> 01:40.467
- [chuckles]
You know what for.

01:40.500 --> 01:42.300
- No, look,
this is a misunderstanding.

01:42.333 --> 01:44.500
I was just using Bradbury
to explore--

01:44.533 --> 01:46.300
- Hey, leave her alone!
- Shut up!

01:46.333 --> 01:48.933
- She didn't do anything!
Let go of her, man!

01:48.967 --> 01:51.433
[class gasps]
- All of you, be quiet!

01:51.467 --> 01:52.567
[class gasps, screams]

01:52.600 --> 01:54.100
- Get in your seat now!

01:54.133 --> 01:56.600
In your seat now!

01:56.633 --> 01:58.567
- Please, I have
two little girls at home.

01:58.600 --> 02:00.733
Just give me a chance
to explain.

02:00.767 --> 02:03.067
- Hey, you hit that kid
pretty hard back there.

02:03.100 --> 02:04.833
- Don't be such a pussy.

02:04.867 --> 02:07.567
- Copy. Additional units
in sight. Over.

02:07.600 --> 02:09.967
- [sighs]
What do we got tomorrow?

02:10.067 --> 02:12.633

You know who else
gets your special medicine?

03:26.800 --> 03:28.100
- Who?

03:28.133 --> 03:29.400
- Spider-Man.

03:29.433 --> 03:30.900
- No he doesn't.

03:30.933 --> 03:32.933
- He does.
I swear.

03:32.967 --> 03:34.700
It's what makes him big
and strong.

03:34.733 --> 03:37.600
- A spider made him big
and strong.

03:37.633 --> 03:40.267

03:44.233 --> 03:46.067
Okay.

Ya did great.

03:56.667 --> 03:59.633
- Are we gonna run out
of medicine?

03:59.667 --> 04:02.433
- No, no we're not.

04:02.467 --> 04:04.167
Don't worry about that, okay?

- Anything new?

04:27.900 --> 04:29.800
- Pattern's getting clearer.

04:29.833 --> 04:31.500
Homeland uses
the same key groups of guys

04:31.533 --> 04:34.667
in the same concentration
every time they move a VIP.

04:34.700 --> 04:37.533
- If we're prepared,
we'll get our opportunity.

04:40.400 --> 04:42.333
What about Katie?

04:42.367 --> 04:44.133
If her operation
doesn't work...

04:44.167 --> 04:45.733
- It'll work.

04:52.867 --> 04:54.300
- So Lindsay's coming
to hang out

04:54.333 --> 04:56.200
with you and Grace
again today, right?

04:56.233 --> 04:57.533
- Yeah.

04:57.567 --> 04:59.100
- I want you
to mind your manners.

04:59.133 --> 05:00.933
- Okay.
- Okay.

05:02.600 --> 05:04.767
Come on.
- Hey, it's Ration Car Tuesday.

05:04.800 --> 05:06.067
Hope everybody's having
lots of fun out there.

05:06.100 --> 05:07.567
- Morning.
- Morning!

05:07.600 --> 05:10.067
- Hey, Hudson.
- Good-bye, babe.

05:10.067 --> 05:11.967
Sister-in-law.

05:13.733 --> 05:16.567

- A kitty cat.

05:16.600 --> 05:18.500

05:18.533 --> 05:20.767
Something special
going on today?

to talk to me?

05:32.867 --> 05:34.367
- Close the door.

05:37.300 --> 05:39.433
Come with me.
I want you to see this.

05:45.100 --> 05:48.233
This is everything we know about
the Los Angeles insurgency.

05:51.567 --> 05:54.267
- You think all these cells
are operating independently?

05:54.300 --> 05:58.233
- I do, despite what Snyder
and the others want to believe.

05:58.267 --> 06:02.067
People have a psychological need
to find the super-villain,

06:02.067 --> 06:05.500
but in my experience, reality
is a lot more complicated.

06:05.533 --> 06:07.300
- So who is Geronimo?

06:07.333 --> 06:10.300
- That's a very good
question.

06:10.333 --> 06:13.167
- You've never brought me behind
the curtain before--why now?

06:13.200 --> 06:15.333
- Well, you were forced
to take this job,

06:15.367 --> 06:17.767
but there are legitimate reasons
for you to be doing it.

06:19.467 --> 06:21.767
Morality's complicated
for people in our position.

06:21.800 --> 06:24.267
I was in Iraq
after the invasion,

06:24.300 --> 06:26.733
and in hindsight,
we had a window or opportunity

06:26.767 --> 06:28.300
before everything
turned to shit.

06:28.333 --> 06:29.800
Maybe if we'd shot
the first five guys

06:29.833 --> 06:31.400
who looted
the national museum,

06:31.433 --> 06:32.633
everything would have been
different.

06:32.667 --> 06:34.500
- [sighs]
Or maybe not.

06:34.533 --> 06:37.067
- A million people died
in the Iraq war, and for what?

06:37.100 --> 06:38.933
Is the life
of the average person

06:38.967 --> 06:41.467
better or worse?

06:41.500 --> 06:44.900
So right now, the resistance
is just a nuisance,

06:44.933 --> 06:48.067
but if, in six months' time,
all these groups coalesce

06:48.067 --> 06:50.467
around Geronimo,
it's really gonna be dangerous.

06:50.500 --> 06:51.967
- Do you think
they can do real damage?

06:52.067 --> 06:55.067
- Well, not to our visitors,
but to us.

06:55.100 --> 06:58.067
To all the people
living here in this block.

06:58.067 --> 07:01.533
I mean, if this resistance
miraculously managed

07:01.567 --> 07:04.633
to do something meaningful,
do you have any idea

07:04.667 --> 07:07.067
the kind of retribution
that would rain down upon us?

07:07.100 --> 07:10.300
There's no version
of an effective resistance.

07:10.333 --> 07:15.900
There's just misguided idealism
that leads to death and despair.

07:20.367 --> 07:22.067
- Can you come with us,
Mom?

07:22.067 --> 07:24.467
- I have work to do, bear,
but...

07:24.500 --> 07:26.167
I'm sorry.

07:26.200 --> 07:27.467
I will catch up
with you guys later.

- All right, kiddos.

about scaring me.

10:10.833 --> 10:12.167
Hey!

10:12.200 --> 10:14.433
Are they searching my house?

- We found this.

10:30.400 --> 10:31.633

in the bomb--

was sending a message.

I need you to come down

10:50.400 --> 10:51.833
- Not gonna happen!
- It's okay, Will.

10:51.867 --> 10:53.500
- No, you don't have to do this.

10:53.533 --> 10:55.867
- She wants to figure out
who bombed our house.

10:55.900 --> 10:57.300
So do I.

12:41.633 --> 12:43.167
I wish it were
under better circumstances,

12:43.200 --> 12:45.333
of course.

12:45.367 --> 12:47.600
- It's been a long day.

12:47.633 --> 12:50.267
- I understand.

12:50.300 --> 12:52.433
I want to assure you
that you and your family

12:52.467 --> 12:55.833
are going to be perfectly safe
from now on.

12:55.867 --> 12:57.333
- How do you
guarantee that?

12:57.367 --> 12:59.233

is speaking to your neighbors,

everyone will be held
personally responsible.

13:05.267 --> 13:06.567
- Sorry, what?

13:06.600 --> 13:07.967
- And we've assigned
a block captain.

13:08.067 --> 13:09.833
It's Patrick and Joanna Hart.

13:09.867 --> 13:11.800
They live two doors down.

13:11.833 --> 13:13.900
They're gonna be
assigning watch duties

13:13.933 --> 13:15.733
and having regular
security briefings

13:15.767 --> 13:17.067
with our team.

13:17.067 --> 13:19.333
I promise you,
everybody on the street

13:19.367 --> 13:21.633
is going to be very concerned
for your safety.

13:21.667 --> 13:22.867
- In other words,
our neighbors are gonna

13:22.900 --> 13:24.333
be scared shitless of us.

13:24.367 --> 13:25.633
- They're gonna learn
to respect your position

13:25.667 --> 13:26.900
in the Authority.

13:28.667 --> 13:31.333
So take me through
what happened.

13:33.067 --> 13:34.867
- Uh, I was upstairs.

13:34.900 --> 13:36.200
- Doing what?

13:36.233 --> 13:37.533
- Folding laundry.

13:43.833 --> 13:45.567
- And then?

13:45.600 --> 13:49.367
- Um...I heard a crash
in the living room,

13:49.400 --> 13:52.333
I ran down the stairs,
I saw the fire,

13:52.367 --> 13:54.200
I grabbed
the fire extinguisher.

13:54.233 --> 13:56.133
- You keep one
in the house?

13:56.167 --> 13:57.567
- Yeah, under the sink.

13:57.600 --> 14:00.700
- And the attacker--
what did he look like?

14:00.733 --> 14:03.267
- He was dressed all in black
with a mask over his face.

14:03.300 --> 14:05.600
- But you did see him.

14:05.633 --> 14:06.700
- Yeah.

14:06.733 --> 14:07.900
- So this attacker
throws a bomb

14:07.933 --> 14:09.767
into your house
and waits for you

14:09.800 --> 14:12.233
to run all the way downstairs
and grab the fire extinguisher

14:12.267 --> 14:14.667
and then lets you get
a look at him?

14:16.300 --> 14:17.933
- Are you asking me
to explain the motivations

14:17.967 --> 14:19.900
of a man who was attacking
my family?

14:19.933 --> 14:22.067
- Maybe he wanted you
to see him, send a message.

14:22.100 --> 14:25.067
- Well if the message
was to terrify me, it worked.

14:36.233 --> 14:38.933
- How did you and Will meet?

14:38.967 --> 14:41.733
- Uh, he came into my bar
in New Orleans.

14:41.767 --> 14:45.433
- When he was still a Ranger
stationed at Fort Benning.

14:45.467 --> 14:46.900
- Yes.

14:46.933 --> 14:49.367
- So, Will joins the FBI,

14:49.400 --> 14:50.967
and you move four times,

14:51.067 --> 14:53.067
and you wind up here in LA.

14:53.067 --> 14:55.100
Don't you miss the South?

14:55.133 --> 14:57.133
- It's why I opened the Yonk.

14:57.167 --> 15:00.700
- That must have caused
some stress in your marriage.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.767
- Sorry--what does
any of this have to do

15:02.800 --> 15:05.067
with finding
who fire-bombed my house?

15:05.067 --> 15:07.633
- Will's in the FBI.
You're running a bar...

15:07.667 --> 15:10.267
not to mention that you're
a very attractive woman.

15:10.300 --> 15:12.367
Men must have been
throwing themselves at you.

15:12.400 --> 15:14.600
- I don't know
what you're getting at,

15:14.633 --> 15:16.900
but Will and I
trust each other.

15:18.867 --> 15:20.633
- Good.

15:26.067 --> 15:27.267
- Hey.

15:27.300 --> 15:28.867
- Hey.
- What happened?

15:28.900 --> 15:31.433
- I don't know.
- What'd she ask you?

15:31.467 --> 15:32.633
- Um...

15:32.667 --> 15:34.133
- Hey--
- U-uh...

15:34.167 --> 15:35.933
I had to go through
everything three times,

15:35.967 --> 15:38.967
and--and--

15:39.067 --> 15:40.200
You know what?
It's over. It's fine.

15:40.233 --> 15:42.233
I really want to go home.

15:43.300 --> 15:44.600
- Okay.

15:44.633 --> 15:46.067
I'll get you a ride.

15:56.200 --> 15:58.067
- Mrs. Burgess.

15:58.067 --> 15:59.700
I heard about
the work you're doing.

15:59.733 --> 16:01.500
It's really inspiring
to see how concerned you are

16:01.533 --> 16:03.700
with preserving
these important works of art.

16:03.733 --> 16:06.400
- And you are...
- Maddie Kenner.

16:06.433 --> 16:09.100
I'm filling the assistant job
you requested from the pool.

16:11.767 --> 16:15.067
- Photocopy these museum records
and file them alphabetically

16:15.067 --> 16:16.100
by artist.

16:16.133 --> 16:17.700
- I think I can handle that.

16:22.767 --> 16:25.333
- What'd you say to my wife?

16:25.367 --> 16:26.767
- [sighs]
Sit down.

16:35.733 --> 16:38.933
In all the different jobs
that I've had,

16:38.967 --> 16:40.267
I've always been valued

16:40.300 --> 16:43.700
for being able
to see the truth about things.

16:43.733 --> 16:46.600
But that's become a lot harder
since the Arrival.

16:46.633 --> 16:50.233
We're taught lies about
the greatness of our hosts,

16:50.267 --> 16:53.067
lies about all the good things
they're gonna do for us.

16:53.100 --> 16:56.233
Lies which we are forced
to regurgitate.

16:56.267 --> 16:58.200
- Why are you telling me this?

16:58.233 --> 17:00.967
- Because
that's our world now, Will.

17:01.067 --> 17:03.800
We lie to everyone.

17:03.833 --> 17:07.067
We lie to our friends and our
colleagues and our family.

17:07.100 --> 17:09.800
We lie out of fear.
We lie to protect ourselves.

17:09.833 --> 17:11.600
- Because
that's how we survive.

17:11.633 --> 17:14.800
- But when lying
becomes this pervasive,

17:14.833 --> 17:16.867
if becomes a lot harder
to see the truth.

17:20.633 --> 17:24.167
Homeland found these
in your son's bedroom.

17:24.200 --> 17:27.967
Apparently, he's been
taping Geronimo's broadcasts.

17:32.167 --> 17:33.800
- Let me fix this.

17:33.833 --> 17:36.633
- If these tapes were
to get logged into the system,

17:36.667 --> 17:38.533
there's nothing I could do.

17:42.800 --> 17:46.067
But if they're sitting
in my drawer...

17:46.067 --> 17:47.767
- Appreciate that.

17:54.067 --> 17:57.267
- I suggest
that you go back home

17:57.300 --> 17:59.167
and be sure that these tapes

18:26.500 --> 18:26.767
.

18:26.800 --> 18:30.133
[neighbors murmuring]

18:34.867 --> 18:37.833
- "Corn beans began
to sprout a huge stalk

18:37.867 --> 18:40.400
up into the clouds."

18:40.433 --> 18:41.700
- Mom!

18:43.633 --> 18:45.100
- Are you okay,
Mrs. Bowman?

18:45.133 --> 18:47.833
- I'm fine.
I'm fine.

18:47.867 --> 18:49.167
- It's lucky you asked me

18:49.200 --> 18:52.067
to take the kids
to the park.

18:52.067 --> 18:54.067
- Thank you, Lindsey.

18:54.100 --> 18:55.533
Why don't you, uh...

18:55.567 --> 18:57.267
why don't you head home
for the day?

19:03.167 --> 19:05.267
- See you tomorrow, kids.

19:05.300 --> 19:06.967
- Bye, Lindsey.

19:10.600 --> 19:12.867
- Why did this happen?

19:15.267 --> 19:16.833
- I guess...

19:20.133 --> 19:23.333
Because sometimes
people do bad things.

19:26.867 --> 19:29.067
[thud]
- [groans]

19:29.100 --> 19:31.067
- We need to talk.

19:31.067 --> 19:32.500
- Some asshole bombs
our house

19:32.533 --> 19:35.667
so the Redhats
can wreck my room?

19:35.700 --> 19:37.667
- What do you think
you're doing?

19:37.700 --> 19:39.833
You've been recording
Geronimo?

19:39.867 --> 19:41.133
- What?

19:41.167 --> 19:42.500
- They found your tapes.

19:45.433 --> 19:48.400
- A lot of people do it.
It's not that big of a deal.

19:48.433 --> 19:49.900
- It's a huge deal.

19:49.933 --> 19:52.300
They can make whatever
they want out of this.

19:52.333 --> 19:53.667
You do anything else?

19:53.700 --> 19:55.800
- No, I just made the tapes.

19:55.833 --> 19:57.467
I didn't do anything else.

19:57.500 --> 19:59.567
- You tell anybody
about my new job?

19:59.600 --> 20:01.033
- No, of course not.

20:02.867 --> 20:04.233
- How do you know
when the broadcasts

20:04.267 --> 20:07.100
are happening?

20:07.133 --> 20:08.800
How do you know
when to tape them?

20:13.467 --> 20:15.333
- It's in the posters.

20:18.700 --> 20:20.933
Whenever new posters
go up around the city,

20:20.967 --> 20:23.367
it's a signal
a broadcast is coming.

20:26.533 --> 20:28.467
This is a code.

20:28.500 --> 20:31.267
It tells you the time
and date of the next message.

20:31.300 --> 20:33.600
- You figured this out
yourself?

20:33.633 --> 20:35.633
- Me and some of my friends.

20:38.267 --> 20:39.733
- [sighs]

20:39.767 --> 20:42.333
- So what's gonna happen
to me?

20:43.800 --> 20:45.633
- I'm gonna fix this.

20:58.867 --> 21:02.267
[distant conversations]

21:04.833 --> 21:08.967
[distant chatter]

21:09.067 --> 21:10.667
- Thanks.

21:16.333 --> 21:18.233
I thought Broussard
was gonna be here.

21:18.267 --> 21:20.233
- He's working.

21:26.200 --> 21:28.367
These are photos
of people coming and going

21:28.400 --> 21:30.200
from the Green Zone.

21:30.233 --> 21:32.600
Point out Will's boss to me.

21:51.733 --> 21:54.900
- I need a guarantee
that my husband will be safe.

21:57.100 --> 21:59.333
- Broussard already
made that deal.

21:59.367 --> 22:01.400
- I need to hear it
from you.

22:01.433 --> 22:03.067
- You need?

22:08.567 --> 22:11.267
- I believe in this cause.
I have proven my loyalty to you.

22:11.300 --> 22:12.767
But I cannot live

22:12.800 --> 22:15.067
with a gun pointed
at my family's head.

22:25.833 --> 22:28.067
- He won't be touched.

22:33.433 --> 22:34.967
- This is her.

22:35.067 --> 22:36.967
Her name is Phyllis.

22:45.500 --> 22:48.067
[radio channels changing]

22:48.067 --> 22:50.433
- My fellow Colonists,

22:50.467 --> 22:53.467
welcome to day 348
of our occupation.

22:53.500 --> 22:56.700
This morning I want
to talk to you about Ocho.

22:56.733 --> 23:00.067
He's a simple man who grew up
in Eastern Los Angeles.

23:00.067 --> 23:01.833
He walked to his bus stop

23:01.867 --> 23:03.600
thinking about
what he could trade

23:03.633 --> 23:07.133
or what he could do that week
to make ends meet;

23:07.167 --> 23:09.433
to put food in the mouths
of his frightened

23:09.467 --> 23:11.500
and hungry family.

23:11.533 --> 23:13.267
- Will?
- Talk to me.

23:13.300 --> 23:17.767
- Looks like we've got
a right on Crenshaw.

23:17.800 --> 23:20.433
- And that was when
the truck rolled into his life,

23:20.467 --> 23:24.467
and this truck was bound
for the same place Ocho was--

23:24.500 --> 23:26.600
the Green Zone.
- Left on Washington!

23:26.633 --> 23:28.167
- 45 seconds.
We gotta do this now.

23:28.200 --> 23:29.967
- Listen up.

23:30.067 --> 23:31.533
The signal's converging
at the next cross street.

23:31.567 --> 23:34.500
- What's there?
- A library.

23:34.533 --> 23:36.467
- The attack was meant only
to take food

23:36.500 --> 23:38.333
from those who had everything

23:38.367 --> 23:41.067
and redistribute it
to those who had none.

23:44.067 --> 23:47.067
[exclamations,
people yelling]

23:51.633 --> 23:53.700
By the time Ocho heard
the first signs of the drones,

23:53.733 --> 23:55.633
it was already too late.

23:59.467 --> 24:02.767
My fellow Colonists,
brothers and sisters,

24:02.800 --> 24:04.100
hermanos y hermanas,

24:04.133 --> 24:06.200
if you never hear
my voice again,

24:06.233 --> 24:09.100
I want you to remember the
words of Frederick Douglass.

24:09.133 --> 24:13.500
If there is no struggle,
there is no progress.

24:13.533 --> 24:16.733
Power concedes nothing
without a demand.

24:16.767 --> 24:19.200
It never did,
and it never will.

24:19.233 --> 24:20.867
- Go, go!

24:20.900 --> 24:23.533
- The limits of tyrants
are prescribed

24:23.567 --> 24:26.700
by the endurance of those
whom they oppress.

24:26.733 --> 24:29.400
The one thing
they cannot take from you,

24:29.433 --> 24:32.067
my fellow Colonists...

24:32.067 --> 24:33.567
is hope.

24:35.267 --> 24:36.767
- Get on your knees!

24:36.800 --> 24:37.933
Do it now!

24:37.967 --> 24:39.767
- This is 5855.
- Come on!

24:39.800 --> 24:41.200
- Target acquired.
- Gimme your hands!

24:46.100 --> 24:46.333
.

24:46.367 --> 24:47.133
- We're good.
- All right, copy that.

24:48.667 --> 24:49.933
I'm getting out, all right?

24:49.967 --> 24:52.300
[background chatter]

24:54.067 --> 24:55.967
[workers murmuring]
- That's Geronimo.

24:56.067 --> 24:59.400
[P.A. announcement
in background]

25:13.067 --> 25:14.333
[door thuds shut]

25:17.233 --> 25:19.567
[elevator clanks]

25:26.567 --> 25:27.800
- Your friends
fire-bombed my house

25:27.833 --> 25:29.300
this morning.

25:29.333 --> 25:32.067
My wife and kids
were home.

25:33.500 --> 25:36.133
- It's a shame they missed you.
- [scoffs]

25:36.167 --> 25:37.967
- [grunts]
[loud thud]

25:38.067 --> 25:39.933
- Easy, Will!

25:39.967 --> 25:43.067
- Who's Geronimo?
- I'm Geronimo!

25:44.067 --> 25:45.733
- Bullshit!
- Will.

25:47.967 --> 25:49.500
- Bullshit.

26:01.467 --> 26:02.700
[beep]

26:02.733 --> 26:04.067
[buzzer]

26:04.067 --> 26:07.067
[tense music]

26:07.067 --> 26:10.600
*

26:10.633 --> 26:12.467
[buzzer]

26:19.767 --> 26:22.200
- Thank you so much.
We'll take it from here.

26:22.233 --> 26:23.933
- Come on.

26:23.967 --> 26:25.267
Let's go.

26:27.300 --> 26:29.767
- Time for us
to get out of here.

26:35.067 --> 26:36.600
- I communicated
to our Hosts

26:36.633 --> 26:39.233
that we captured Geronimo.
They were very pleased.

26:39.267 --> 26:40.833
- You spoke
to them directly?

26:40.867 --> 26:43.067
- Well, no.
Through Helena.

26:43.100 --> 26:45.067
[knocks on door]
- Yes, come in.

26:46.800 --> 26:49.733
- There he is!

26:49.767 --> 26:51.200
My all-star.

26:51.233 --> 26:53.833
Great job today.

26:53.867 --> 26:56.700
- It's not him.

26:56.733 --> 26:58.833
- What?
What are you talking about?

26:58.867 --> 27:02.967
- Call it an educated guess.
It's not Geronimo.

27:06.200 --> 27:08.167
- Did you observe
the interrogation?

27:08.200 --> 27:11.233
- I don't need to see
what goes on down there.

27:11.267 --> 27:14.767
That guy we caught was
doing pirate radio, yeah, but...

27:14.800 --> 27:16.233
I seriously doubt
he's the mastermind

27:16.267 --> 27:18.833
of your insurgency.

27:18.867 --> 27:20.767
- Is this true?

27:20.800 --> 27:23.067
- Well, we'll have to see
what the interrogation yields,

27:23.067 --> 27:26.167
but I trust Will's instincts.

27:26.200 --> 27:28.067
- Shit.

27:28.100 --> 27:30.367
I already passed
the news upstairs.

27:34.500 --> 27:36.733
- You know,
dismantling insurgencies

27:36.767 --> 27:38.900
is all about breaking links
in a chain.

27:38.933 --> 27:40.900
This might not be
what we hoped,

27:40.933 --> 27:43.067
but this is progress.

27:46.533 --> 27:48.600
- I guess I'll put
the champagne on ice.

27:56.433 --> 27:57.967
- [sighs]
Guess Snyder's not

27:58.067 --> 28:00.733
the first difficult boss
you've had to deal with.

28:00.767 --> 28:03.067
- Not even close.

28:03.067 --> 28:05.667
He'll get over it.

28:05.700 --> 28:07.500
- You told Georgina Anderton
that she was getting

28:07.533 --> 28:09.067
the Ai Weiwei?

28:09.067 --> 28:12.167
The Ai Weiwei got sent up
after the Arrival.

28:12.200 --> 28:13.967
We don't have anything else
to send her

28:14.067 --> 28:15.333
with that kind of cache.

28:15.367 --> 28:17.467
- What about
the Hockney?

28:17.500 --> 28:19.367
- It's a lesser Hockney.

28:19.400 --> 28:21.900
You think she won't know that?

28:21.933 --> 28:23.733
- David Schwartz
had an Ai Weiwei.

28:26.167 --> 28:28.167
He lived up off Coldwater.

28:28.200 --> 28:29.367
- How do you know that?

28:29.400 --> 28:30.833
- Because I used to work
at the gallery

28:30.867 --> 28:32.700
that sold it to him.

28:37.067 --> 28:38.467
- Yo, anything?

28:38.500 --> 28:40.067
- Nothing yet!

28:40.067 --> 28:42.200
- The detainee said
this is where he picked up

28:42.233 --> 28:43.867
the radio scripts.

28:43.900 --> 28:46.733
- He would have said anything
to get out of that room.

28:50.067 --> 28:52.167
- Hey, Will!

28:52.200 --> 28:53.267
Check it out!

28:55.700 --> 28:58.333

What are you looking at?

29:27.167 --> 29:27.433

29:27.467 --> 29:28.433
- Where do you want this?
- You can just leave it

29:29.833 --> 29:31.867
right over there.
- Okay.

29:31.900 --> 29:35.367
- So, you were right
about the Schwartz' house.

29:35.400 --> 29:38.433
What other big collections
are still out there?

29:38.467 --> 29:41.633
- I'm not sure.

29:41.667 --> 29:45.600
- Would a more permanent
position jog your memory?

29:45.633 --> 29:47.200
- My son is a diabetic.

29:47.233 --> 29:48.900
We've been having trouble
getting his insulin.

29:48.933 --> 29:50.467
- That would never be a problem
if you were a member

29:50.500 --> 29:53.233
of my staff.

29:53.267 --> 29:56.967
- I might know the location
of a few more collections.

29:57.067 --> 29:59.067
- Excellent.

29:59.100 --> 30:02.967
But if you work for me,
you work for me.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.400
Do you understand?
- Absolutely.

30:06.567 --> 30:08.233
- Be here at 9:00 a.m.
tomorrow.

30:27.833 --> 30:29.600
- Han Dynasty.
- [gasps]

30:29.633 --> 30:32.600
- Was actually once a part
of the Great Wall,

30:32.633 --> 30:35.467
or so they told us in Beijing.

30:35.500 --> 30:38.100
- [exhales]
Antiquities aren't my specialty.

30:38.133 --> 30:40.400
- You are...
- Maddie.

30:40.433 --> 30:42.367
I'm working for Charlotte.

30:42.400 --> 30:44.500
- My wife has excellent taste.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.867
Would you like some more?

30:48.900 --> 30:50.767
Wine?

30:50.800 --> 30:53.567
- I have to get home.

30:53.600 --> 30:55.767
- Maybe some other time?
- Sure.

31:12.067 --> 31:14.067
- Geronimo's
in the Green Zone?

31:14.067 --> 31:15.533
- Snyder's not gonna be happy.

31:15.567 --> 31:17.167
- A lot of people
aren't gonna be happy,

31:17.200 --> 31:20.200
but I'll handle it.
You just better be right.

31:21.833 --> 31:24.633
- I'd bet on it.

31:24.667 --> 31:28.700
- I, um...I destroyed
your son's tapes.

31:30.167 --> 31:31.433
- Really?

31:31.467 --> 31:33.800
- Why, you wanna
check the drawer?

31:33.833 --> 31:35.433
- You might be
the kind of person

31:35.467 --> 31:38.367
that kept 'em for leverage,
but not in that drawer.

31:38.400 --> 31:40.367
- [chuckles]

31:40.400 --> 31:42.300
It's a shame
how few people we have

31:42.333 --> 31:44.500
who we can really trust,
isn't it?

31:49.067 --> 31:50.567
- Very true.

32:08.233 --> 32:09.733
[sighs]

32:12.067 --> 32:13.567
- Hey.

32:13.600 --> 32:15.100
- Hey.

32:15.133 --> 32:16.767
- You all right?

32:16.800 --> 32:18.933
- Long day.

32:18.967 --> 32:20.767
- What's the matter?

32:23.300 --> 32:25.867
- How are the kids?

32:25.900 --> 32:28.533
- Uh, Gracie's still
a little scared,

32:28.567 --> 32:31.067
and Bram's...

32:31.067 --> 32:32.600
Bram.

32:32.633 --> 32:33.733

32:36.967 --> 32:38.767
I love you.

32:40.867 --> 32:42.733
- I love you too.

32:45.800 --> 32:47.900
- Mm.

32:51.767 --> 32:53.400
What happened
to the beach photo?

32:53.433 --> 32:56.600
Did it get broken
in the fire?

32:56.633 --> 32:59.233
- No, your clumsy wife
managed to knock it off the wall

32:59.267 --> 33:00.567
and break the glass.

33:00.600 --> 33:02.267
- [sighs]
- I'll fix it.

33:02.300 --> 33:04.100
- You better.
I love that photo.

33:06.433 --> 33:08.567
- I gotta open the Yonk.
- Okay.

33:08.600 --> 33:09.933
- I'll finish this up.

33:09.967 --> 33:11.267
You okay to say good night
to Gracie?

33:11.300 --> 33:13.300

34:17.733 --> 34:19.833

34:22.067 --> 34:24.967
Um, about the tapes...

34:25.067 --> 34:28.467

You're okay.

- What about Geronimo?

34:33.733 --> 34:35.067
- What about him?

34:36.533 --> 34:39.867
- Do you know why
I listen to those tapes?

34:39.900 --> 34:42.633
Because Geronimo
is the only person telling us

34:42.667 --> 34:44.833
that someday
things might change.

34:47.067 --> 34:49.400
I know you're good
at your job, Dad,

34:49.433 --> 34:52.333
but maybe with Geronimo,
you don't have to be so good.

34:56.567 --> 34:57.900
- [sighs]

35:21.600 --> 35:23.467
- Come have a drink with me.

35:27.067 --> 35:30.533
Shouldn't this be "the Yok,"
not "the Yonk"?

35:30.567 --> 35:32.767
I mean, the "N" is
after the "K."

35:32.800 --> 35:34.400
Yok-na-patawpha.

35:34.433 --> 35:37.300
- I like "the Yonk" better.
- Fair enough.

35:37.333 --> 35:39.600
I brought my own.
I hope you don't mind.

35:39.633 --> 35:40.633
- What are you doing here?

35:40.667 --> 35:42.467
- Please, Katie, join me.

35:48.400 --> 35:50.433
This was my husband's
favorite.

35:55.667 --> 35:58.367
Mm.

35:58.400 --> 36:00.600
Ed and I took a trip
up the California coast

36:00.633 --> 36:03.500
to celebrate
our fifth anniversary.

36:03.533 --> 36:05.833
All the way up PCH
to Point Reyes.

36:05.867 --> 36:07.433
He planned the whole thing.

36:07.467 --> 36:10.967
The bed and breakfast,
the oysters on the beach,

36:11.067 --> 36:13.700
and the hike
along the cliffs.

36:13.733 --> 36:15.167
We didn't see each other
a lot then.

36:15.200 --> 36:17.067
I had been working
out of Ireland

36:17.067 --> 36:18.533
for a long time.

36:21.233 --> 36:25.967
The work was hard.
[sighs]

36:26.067 --> 36:30.067
Some of us sought
external comforts.

36:30.067 --> 36:34.233
Mine was an officer in the
British Special Air Service.

36:36.467 --> 36:38.267
I rationalized it
by telling myself

36:38.300 --> 36:40.600
that I needed it
to stay whole.

36:40.633 --> 36:42.867
Ed didn't know what I'd done.

36:42.900 --> 36:46.267
He never found out.

36:46.300 --> 36:48.300
He loved me too much.

36:50.067 --> 36:51.467
- Why are you telling me
this?

36:53.667 --> 36:56.467
- Will reminds me
so much of that.

36:56.500 --> 36:59.633
He's a tremendous
professional.

36:59.667 --> 37:01.067
He's smart.

37:01.100 --> 37:04.633

driven, funny...

for what she is.

that you'd seen someone die?

37:34.367 --> 37:36.767

what you're talking about.

37:36.800 --> 37:38.567

gotten involved with

37:38.600 --> 37:41.667
are not who they appear to be.

37:41.700 --> 37:45.767
These kinds of movements
prey on idealists like you.

but they will use you

37:48.100 --> 37:49.700
