Who here knows
what a Christmas Club is?

01:20.634 --> 01:23.534
Oh, isn't that where morons
put money in the bank

01:23.534 --> 01:26.667
to get 2 percent interest
instead of the normal 5?

01:29.400 --> 01:30.400
Uh, yeah.

01:32.601 --> 01:34.801
Anyway, I've got one of these
Christmas Club things,

01:34.801 --> 01:39.200
and was able to save
a pretty penny this year.

01:39.200 --> 01:42.334
So, in addition to our annual
Christmas feast at Denny's,

01:47.133 --> 01:49.033
this year we're
getting presents.

01:49.033 --> 01:50.701
Oh! I can't
believe it.

01:50.701 --> 01:53.267
This'll be the worst
Christmas I ever had.

01:53.267 --> 01:56.000
I'll wind up home alone
sitting in the dark.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.100
That is...unless
some friends invite me over.

01:59.100 --> 02:00.100
[CONSOLINGLY]
Oh.

02:04.334 --> 02:08.400
Poor Marcie.
I feel so bad for her.

02:08.400 --> 02:11.334
So, Al, we're really
gonna get presents!

02:11.334 --> 02:12.868
Yeah! You betcha!
Ha-ha!

02:12.868 --> 02:14.467
I pick up the money
tomorrow morning.

02:14.467 --> 02:17.100
This is gonna be the greatest
Bundy Christmas ever!

KELLY:
Daddy!

02:55.334 --> 02:56.434
Oh!
Daddy!

02:56.434 --> 02:58.234
BOTH: Give me! Give me!
Give me! Give me!

02:58.234 --> 02:59.467
Oh.

02:59.467 --> 03:03.033
Now, kids, give your father
a chance to relax.

03:03.033 --> 03:04.067
Make room.

03:05.234 --> 03:06.701
Give me! Give me!
Give me! Give me!

03:06.701 --> 03:07.734
Oh, Dad!

03:07.734 --> 03:08.934
Give us our presents!

03:08.934 --> 03:10.701
I love you!
Give us our presents!

03:10.701 --> 03:12.868
Family!

03:12.868 --> 03:15.234
I think we've fallen
a tad short

03:15.234 --> 03:17.601
of the true meaning
of Christmas.

03:17.601 --> 03:20.234
It's about love, about family.

03:20.234 --> 03:23.300
I think something's rotten
in the state of Denver, Mom.

03:25.367 --> 03:26.701
Don't worry.

03:26.701 --> 03:29.200
Even a dullard like your father
isn't stupid enough

03:29.200 --> 03:30.767
to come home
without presents.

03:37.567 --> 03:39.767
I don't like the looks
of this, Mom.

03:39.767 --> 03:43.334
Yeah, he does have that
just-plugged-the-toilet grin

03:43.334 --> 03:44.334
on his face.

03:48.701 --> 03:51.100
I think he's empty.

03:51.100 --> 03:52.467
Let's check it out.

03:57.400 --> 04:01.467
So, Al, I, uh, noticed
you're not burdened down

04:01.467 --> 04:04.033
with presents
for your loving family.

04:04.033 --> 04:07.133
Are they, uh,
in the car?

04:08.534 --> 04:09.534
Well, no.

04:11.467 --> 04:13.834
Are they, uh,
being delivered?

04:14.501 --> 04:15.501
No.

04:17.100 --> 04:20.132
Are they...
invisible?

04:25.000 --> 04:27.901
Well, you guys get
to ask the good questions.

04:27.901 --> 04:30.267
If, for once, you'd let me
go first, I would have asked--

04:30.267 --> 04:32.133
Shh.

04:32.133 --> 04:33.634
Honey.

04:33.634 --> 04:37.567
Okay, Al, enough
of this loving-family crap.

04:40.133 --> 04:41.634
What did you do?

04:43.801 --> 04:45.634
Well, I'm going
to be honest with you, Peg.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
You see, I was coming home
with great presents,

04:49.000 --> 04:51.367
when I was surrounded
by a band of...

04:51.367 --> 04:52.734
bears and Indians.

04:54.901 --> 04:56.334
Daddy, are you okay?

04:58.267 --> 04:59.567
Rest, Kelly.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.767
Snookums,

05:02.767 --> 05:06.467
you know, if you really did
come home with no presents,

05:06.467 --> 05:09.868
we wouldn't mind,
would we, kids?

05:09.868 --> 05:11.567
No, Mom.

05:11.567 --> 05:13.400
I would.

05:13.400 --> 05:14.968
I mean, no,
I wouldn't, Mom.

05:14.968 --> 05:19.033
We wuv our Daddy,
right, kids?

05:21.033 --> 05:23.734
Right, Mom.
Right, Mom.

05:23.734 --> 05:24.834
There.

05:24.834 --> 05:27.167
You feel
better now, Al?

05:28.267 --> 05:29.701
Yes, I do, Peg.

05:30.601 --> 05:33.133
Then give us
our presents.

05:33.133 --> 05:35.400
You do have presents,
don't you, Al?

05:38.834 --> 05:41.300
And we kissed your hand
and called you Daddy.

05:43.100 --> 05:44.934
The bank closed.

05:44.934 --> 05:46.901
Yeah, right.
Yeah, you rotten mullet-head.

05:49.901 --> 05:50.934
It wasn't my fault.

05:50.934 --> 05:52.334
I did everything
that I could.

05:52.334 --> 05:54.767
A real Daddy would have
held up a liquor store.

05:56.434 --> 05:58.801
They're open
till 6, you know.

05:58.801 --> 06:01.901
Now, kids, I'm sure
your father has a good reason

06:01.901 --> 06:03.801
for not taking that
money out yesterday.

06:03.801 --> 06:07.167
Tell us
the reason, witless.

06:07.167 --> 06:09.400
I wanted to get that
extra day of interest.

06:09.400 --> 06:12.234
Oh, that would have been what--
About 3 cents, Al?

06:12.234 --> 06:14.634
Hey, that would have been
our waitress's tip at Denny's.

06:16.534 --> 06:19.767
Thank your father for flushing
another Christmas, kids.

06:19.767 --> 06:21.167
BOTH:
Thanks, Dad.

06:21.167 --> 06:22.934
Hey, just because
we don't have presents

06:22.934 --> 06:24.767
doesn't mean we can't
have Christmas.

06:24.767 --> 06:26.334
Daddy, Christmas
without presents

06:26.334 --> 06:28.300
is like Thanksgiving
without pizza.

06:30.467 --> 06:33.634
Oh, well, I suppose there are
a lot of families much worse off

06:33.634 --> 06:35.133
than us at Christmas.

06:35.133 --> 06:39.501
Of course, they're all living
in trees and worshipping sticks.

06:39.501 --> 06:41.634
But, let's make
the best of it.

06:41.634 --> 06:42.734
Let's go to Denny's.

06:42.734 --> 06:43.901
I have 8 bucks.

06:43.901 --> 06:45.467
That's enough for three
of us to eat.

06:45.467 --> 06:48.133
Ha-ha. I guess we'll
all have to draw straws.

06:48.133 --> 06:49.434
Well, I don't mind doin' that

06:49.434 --> 06:51.267
'cause I don't think
I should have to do it,

06:51.267 --> 06:52.334
since I do work all year--

06:52.334 --> 06:55.000
I am gonna buy presents
on the 26th.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.000
--but I think to be fair,

06:56.000 --> 06:57.467
I'll have to, uh...

06:59.100 --> 07:00.667
Bring me back some pie crust.

07:02.434 --> 07:04.000
Well, let's see
how the lights work.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.701

07:12.767 --> 07:14.868
That's just great.
They hang there all year long.

07:14.868 --> 07:17.267
The one lousy time
you want 'em to work...

07:18.934 --> 07:20.300
Well, it's a wonderful life.

07:22.133 --> 07:24.000
I don't know.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.734
Sometimes, I think it might have
been better if I was never born.

I'm looking for, uh,

08:00.601 --> 08:01.601
an Al Bundy.

an Al Bundy?

up there for a minute?!

08:11.801 --> 08:13.701
What kind of a mess
have you gotten me into?!

08:13.701 --> 08:15.434
What have you done to me?!

08:15.434 --> 08:17.667
[SOBS]

08:25.801 --> 08:27.133
There, there, buddy.

08:27.133 --> 08:28.367
Uh, how about
I go get my gun

08:28.367 --> 08:30.300
and shoot you
with a nice silver bullet?

You'll just have to give me
a minute with this, Bundy.

08:36.900 --> 08:39.167
I thought I was here
to save a human soul.

08:41.501 --> 08:42.833
That's all right.
Never mind.

08:42.833 --> 08:43.833
Hold on a minute.

08:47.400 --> 08:49.901
Oh, thanks a lot!

08:49.901 --> 08:51.367
You can turn water into wine,

08:51.367 --> 08:53.367
but you can't send me
with any booze, huh?!

08:59.000 --> 09:00.701
You're one
of my wife's relatives.

09:02.901 --> 09:05.200
I've never seen
one upright before.

09:08.434 --> 09:12.000
No, much like a neutered dog,
you don't get it, Bundy.

09:13.501 --> 09:14.868
Read my lips.

09:14.868 --> 09:16.901

Hell, I gotta apologize.

09:20.234 --> 09:21.667
I just thought you were a nut.

09:23.667 --> 09:25.701
Well, I'll get my guitar
and call Elvis.

09:25.701 --> 09:27.701
The three of us will
rock in the New Year.

09:30.667 --> 09:33.601
Hey, it's no sleigh ride
for me either, Bundy.

09:33.601 --> 09:34.934
Usually,
on Christmas,

09:34.934 --> 09:36.968
I'd be over at Moses' house.

09:36.968 --> 09:40.200
I'd be out by the pool,
waiting for the new guy

09:40.200 --> 09:41.267
to jump off the board.

09:41.267 --> 09:42.801
And then Mo parts the water.

Now, that's Christmas!

09:47.567 --> 09:49.667
That's Christmas, man.

09:49.667 --> 09:52.234
Yeah, but I sort
of fell from grace.

09:52.234 --> 09:54.234
They, uh-- They caught me
scalpin' tickets

09:54.234 --> 09:55.667

And here I am.
But enough about me.

to convince you that

10:02.167 --> 10:03.267

10:04.567 --> 10:06.300
Make my Christmas lights work.

10:22.701 --> 10:24.167
Aren't you supposed
to get three?

10:24.167 --> 10:27.067
Hey, don't be a wish pig,
Bundy, all right?

10:27.067 --> 10:28.834
You want three wishes?
Get a genie.

10:30.567 --> 10:32.734
Besides, anything that
I can't get a receipt for

10:32.734 --> 10:34.167
comes out of my own pocket.

10:35.300 --> 10:36.300
Aw, come on.

10:36.300 --> 10:37.834
Just give me one more.

and give me the Hee Haw girls.</i>

I know you think
you got it tough.

10:52.567 --> 10:54.167
Your wife doesn't respect you.

10:54.167 --> 10:56.167
Your kids think
you're a failure.

10:56.167 --> 10:58.167
A good day for you
is when you don't come across

10:58.167 --> 10:59.400
any new foot diseases.

10:59.400 --> 11:02.334
Believe me, I sympathize.

11:02.334 --> 11:03.868
But you think your life reeks?

11:03.868 --> 11:05.767
Take a whiff of mine, pal.

11:05.767 --> 11:09.767
My wife gained 100 pounds
for every year we were married.

11:09.767 --> 11:12.234
We had two kids. I think
she ate 'em. I don't know.

11:15.267 --> 11:16.567
I hated drivin' home so much,

11:16.567 --> 11:19.968
I had vanity plates written up
that said, "Hit me."

11:19.968 --> 11:24.601
But despite it all...
she loved me.

11:24.601 --> 11:26.634
You know how I know?

11:26.634 --> 11:29.634
Because she told me!

11:29.634 --> 11:31.667
Oh, yeah,
when I was at work,

11:31.667 --> 11:35.200
she loved my father,
my brother, my bookie.

11:35.200 --> 11:37.901
But when I found my
grandfather's teeth in my bed

11:37.901 --> 11:40.601
under the pillow, then I knew
there was trouble in paradise.

11:42.400 --> 11:46.000
That's when I did what any
other man would do, Bundy.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.334
I canceled my insurance,
and I hung myself.

11:48.334 --> 11:49.801
Showed her, huh?

11:49.801 --> 11:51.400
[LAUGHS]

11:55.367 --> 11:57.968
And you're here to help me, huh?

11:59.267 --> 12:02.200
That I am, my man.

12:02.200 --> 12:05.200
See, if I help you,
I get my wings.

12:05.200 --> 12:08.133
And that means a lot up there,
especially with the chicks.

12:09.667 --> 12:13.133
If I get wings, I get to pick up
on the girls who died young.

12:16.133 --> 12:17.501
Well, that sounds great for you,

12:17.501 --> 12:18.868
but what are you gonna do
for me?

12:18.868 --> 12:21.033
Show me that my life can
only get worse?

12:21.033 --> 12:23.634
What are you gonna do? Give me
two more wives? Three more kids?

12:23.634 --> 12:25.968
Make me a--
Make me a White Sox fan?

12:27.934 --> 12:30.133
No, Bundy. We're gonna
take a little trip.

12:30.133 --> 12:32.868
Just like you wondered,
I'm gonna show you

12:32.868 --> 12:35.067
what it would've been like
if you'd never been born.

you're there, Bundy,

you're havin' sex.

13:20.901 --> 13:22.234
She's cooking.

13:23.801 --> 13:25.567
She told me she was
allergic to fire.

13:26.567 --> 13:28.300
Gee, that's weird.

13:28.300 --> 13:30.834
I guess after I died,
women started lyin', huh?

13:40.300 --> 13:41.868
Hello, Mother.

13:41.868 --> 13:45.400
Oh, you're home
a trifle late, dear.

13:45.400 --> 13:46.734
Oh, yes, I know.

13:46.734 --> 13:48.968
Regrettable,
but necessary.

13:48.968 --> 13:51.934
I had to stop on the way home
to soundly thrash a bully,

13:51.934 --> 13:53.834
who was making lewd
and suggestive comments

13:53.834 --> 13:55.300
to some female
school chums.

13:57.567 --> 14:00.801
Oh, Mother, when will men
realize that the delicate flower

14:00.801 --> 14:03.267
of womanhood must be allowed
to bloom in freedom?

14:05.200 --> 14:07.934
You're such
a fine young man.

14:07.934 --> 14:09.934
I knew it would pay
to breastfeed you

14:09.934 --> 14:11.234
till you were 9.

14:16.601 --> 14:18.501
Do you need
any money, dear?

14:18.501 --> 14:22.534
Oh, no. I could never
take money from you.

14:22.534 --> 14:25.234
You and Father have given me
the greatest gift of all:

14:25.234 --> 14:26.901
the gift of life.

14:26.901 --> 14:28.801
Would he feel it
if I kicked him?

14:31.133 --> 14:32.901
No, but for a little
extra cash,

14:32.901 --> 14:34.534
I could give him
your dog's face.

14:35.968 --> 14:37.167
Would you take an IOU?

14:37.167 --> 14:38.400
Not from you.

14:39.767 --> 14:41.200
Hello, Mama!

14:44.000 --> 14:45.701
I'm home from college.

14:48.334 --> 14:49.334
College?

14:49.334 --> 14:51.334
She flunked lunch
in high school.

14:53.200 --> 14:54.400
Good news.

14:54.400 --> 14:56.434
They're publishing
my poetry in French.

14:56.434 --> 14:57.434
Oh.
Oh.

14:57.434 --> 15:00.133
Oh, Budrick.

15:00.133 --> 15:01.534
Mwah.
Mwah.

15:01.534 --> 15:03.267
You look fabulous.

15:03.267 --> 15:05.601
You really must be popular
with the ladies.

15:05.601 --> 15:10.267
Well, I've broken a few hearts,
but gained some good friends.

15:12.567 --> 15:15.167
And you, dear sister,
are you still frigid?

15:18.067 --> 15:22.033
Yes, but pleasures of the flesh
muddy the thinking.

15:22.033 --> 15:23.601
She's right, you know.

15:23.601 --> 15:25.934
I saved myself
for marriage.

15:25.934 --> 15:29.367
Oh, come on!

15:29.367 --> 15:31.734
The football team
retired her jersey.

15:38.167 --> 15:39.934
I mean, what kind of guy
would marry her

15:39.934 --> 15:41.267
if she wasn't
puttin' out?

15:43.100 --> 15:47.801
* I saw Mommy kissing
Santa Claus *

15:47.801 --> 15:49.601
It's Daddy!
It's Daddy!

15:50.234 --> 15:52.234
Ho-ho! Family!

15:52.234 --> 15:53.367
Oh, Daddy!

15:53.367 --> 15:54.767
Dear heart!

15:54.767 --> 15:55.767
Ha-ha-ha!

15:55.767 --> 15:57.334
Oh.

15:57.334 --> 15:58.501
[GIGGLES]

15:58.501 --> 16:00.000
There they go again.

16:01.901 --> 16:04.234
You know those wings
you been wantin'?
Yeah.

16:04.234 --> 16:07.367
You think you can make a pair
out of this guy's kidneys?

16:07.367 --> 16:08.868
Hey, don't worry
about him, Bundy.

16:08.868 --> 16:10.267
I checked into his future.

16:10.267 --> 16:12.968
By the time he's 60,
his stomach is so ulcer-ridden

16:12.968 --> 16:14.634
that-- Oh.
Oh, that's you.

16:16.501 --> 16:18.667
Sorry, man.
Sorry.

16:18.667 --> 16:20.801
So, how was
your day, honey?

16:20.801 --> 16:24.334
Oh, wonderful as every day
since we met.

16:25.501 --> 16:28.200
Am I the only one
who can taste the bile?

16:30.167 --> 16:32.767
Oh, by the way, dear,
I didn't have a chance

16:32.767 --> 16:34.367
to finish
the Christmas cookies.

16:34.367 --> 16:37.467
I had a run-in
with a shoe salesman today.

16:37.467 --> 16:38.968
There she goes.
She's leavin' him.

16:38.968 --> 16:41.100
No one can resist
a shoe salesman.

16:41.100 --> 16:43.834
I was only trying on shoes
for a couple of hours,

16:43.834 --> 16:45.801
and he barked at me.

16:45.801 --> 16:49.534
He was a rude, smelly,
uneducated, little man. Hmph.

16:49.534 --> 16:53.467
Imagine, a grown man selling
shoes for a living. Ha-ha!

16:55.868 --> 16:57.567
But let us remember
the old adage,

16:57.567 --> 17:02.934
"I lamented I had no shoes until
I saw the man who sold them."

17:05.601 --> 17:08.666
I'll bet you're all wondering
where your presents are.

17:08.666 --> 17:10.400
Oh, Father...

17:10.400 --> 17:12.701
you needn't get us anything.

17:12.701 --> 17:13.701
What?!

17:15.099 --> 17:16.634
Oh, yes.

17:16.634 --> 17:19.501
Your love and guidance
all these years means more to us

17:19.501 --> 17:21.267
than any store-bought bauble.

17:22.701 --> 17:24.267
Oh--
I--

17:24.267 --> 17:26.534
I just love
you guys so much.

17:29.200 --> 17:31.200
Well, gee,
this was fun.

17:33.534 --> 17:34.801
What do we do next?

17:34.801 --> 17:37.868
Go back in time to the day
I should have been conceived?

17:37.868 --> 17:39.868
Watch my father invent
the condom?

17:44.567 --> 17:45.667
No.

17:45.667 --> 17:47.300
No more time travel
for me.

17:47.300 --> 17:48.300
It gives me the runs.

17:50.033 --> 17:51.901
Besides, Bundy,
you're the one that wanted

17:51.901 --> 17:54.200
to see what life would be like
if you'd never been born.

17:54.200 --> 17:55.801
So grin and bear it.

17:55.801 --> 18:00.167
Family, I have
a little announcement.

18:00.167 --> 18:04.334
I do have a special Christmas
present for everyone.

18:04.334 --> 18:08.200
I've watched you all suffer
in this hovel for years,

18:08.200 --> 18:09.801
but over the years,

18:09.801 --> 18:14.234
I've been saving, and that,
along with Mommy's sewing money,

18:14.234 --> 18:16.801
has allowed me
to buy us a new house.

18:16.801 --> 18:18.968
A mansion, really.

18:18.968 --> 18:22.434
So how about joining me
in a "Whoa, Jablonski."

18:22.434 --> 18:25.767
TOGETHER:
Whoa, Jablonski!

18:25.767 --> 18:28.267
<i>[MOUTHING]
Whoa, Jablonski?</i>

18:29.534 --> 18:32.667
Oh, Norman,
what a special Christmas.

18:32.667 --> 18:36.067
Let's just stand here
and love each other.

18:36.067 --> 18:37.167
Kids.

18:41.834 --> 18:42.834
I love you.

18:42.834 --> 18:43.834
I love you.

18:43.834 --> 18:44.834
I love you.

18:44.834 --> 18:45.834
I love you.

18:45.834 --> 18:46.834
I love you.

18:46.834 --> 18:48.501
I love you.

18:48.501 --> 18:50.801
ALL:
I love you.

18:50.801 --> 18:54.868
Now, that's the straw that
broke the camel's back.

18:54.868 --> 18:57.634
I'm sorry, Bundy.
I failed you.

18:57.634 --> 18:59.801
I was supposed to show you
why you should live,

18:59.801 --> 19:01.367
but I can't think
of one darn reason.

19:02.801 --> 19:04.234
I'll never get
my wings now.

19:05.667 --> 19:07.667
And you know what kind
of woman you get in heaven

19:07.667 --> 19:09.901
drivin' around
in a '78 Pinto?

19:09.901 --> 19:11.601
The same kind of woman
you get down here

19:11.601 --> 19:13.467
drivin' around a '78 Pinto.

19:14.667 --> 19:15.901
God, I'm depressed.

19:19.033 --> 19:20.033
Well, that's better.

19:25.300 --> 19:26.434
Wait a second.

19:27.868 --> 19:29.934
I wanna be back
with my family.

19:31.033 --> 19:32.300
Why?

19:32.300 --> 19:35.667
Look at them.
They're happy.

19:35.667 --> 19:37.634
Not a care in the world.

19:37.634 --> 19:39.634
You think I'm gonna
let that happen

19:39.634 --> 19:42.467
after all the grief
they put me through?

19:43.634 --> 19:45.534
I want to live!

19:45.534 --> 19:48.133
Bundy, are you serious?

19:48.133 --> 19:49.634
That means I'm gonna
be an angel!

19:49.634 --> 19:51.367
I'm gonna get my wings!

19:51.367 --> 19:53.601
I'm gonna be a real angel!

19:53.601 --> 19:55.267
But first--

19:55.267 --> 19:58.067
First I'm gonna go take
a look at my ex-wife.

19:58.067 --> 20:00.234
You really did love her, huh?

20:00.234 --> 20:01.667
No.

20:01.667 --> 20:04.567
No, I just wanna put a package
of Ding Dongs just out of reach

20:04.567 --> 20:06.167
of her porkpie fingers.

20:07.534 --> 20:10.234
And then, as she oozes that
thousand-pound bulk

20:10.234 --> 20:11.234
over the table,

20:11.234 --> 20:13.100
lifts up three of her chins

20:13.100 --> 20:15.434
so she's able to put
one of 'em into her mouth,

20:15.434 --> 20:17.000
I'm gonna turn 'em
into me!

20:17.000 --> 20:19.033
A 20-year-old rotting corpse!

20:19.033 --> 20:20.601
How do you like that,
Thelma?

20:20.601 --> 20:22.667
Daddy's home for Christmas!

20:22.667 --> 20:24.734
You pig! You slut!

20:24.734 --> 20:26.701

Al, get up!

20:40.567 --> 20:41.667

20:41.667 --> 20:43.400
You know me?

20:44.467 --> 20:47.033
Well, of course,
I know you.

20:47.033 --> 20:49.334
Why do you think
I didn't help you up?

20:50.767 --> 20:52.868
Come on, kids,
let's go inside.

20:52.868 --> 20:54.934
Knowing your father,
he'll catch pneumonia,

20:54.934 --> 20:56.834
cough on us,
and we'll all get sick.

20:56.834 --> 20:58.534
Out of the way, Al.

love or money?

I can always rent love.

of an orange?

You mean, just straight
off the top of my head?

Ha, no. Don't worry
about it, pumpkin.

21:27.300 --> 21:29.934

some Christmas cookies.

Well, I'm glad you're
in a good mood.

You know, they raised
the Christmas platter

21:38.834 --> 21:40.300
at Denny's 50 cents.

21:40.300 --> 21:44.100
