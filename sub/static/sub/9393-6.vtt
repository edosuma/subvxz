All right, I'm going
to the store.

00:36.070 --> 00:40.205
Yeah, can you get me a chess set
and a backwards hat?

00:40.207 --> 00:41.874
I got some inner-city
school kids

00:41.876 --> 00:43.075
I gotta inspire tomorrow.

00:43.077 --> 00:45.811
Okay, Darius,
point to the king.

00:48.982 --> 00:52.217
That's right.
It's you.

00:52.219 --> 00:53.652
Hey, Lois. Doesn't, uh,
somebody have

00:53.654 --> 00:55.054
a birthday coming up
this week?

00:55.056 --> 00:57.356
Oh, it's nice of you
to remember, Brian,

00:57.358 --> 00:59.825
but, frankly, I'd rather
let this one slip by.

00:59.827 --> 01:02.194
I don't need to be reminded
how old I'm gettin'.

01:02.196 --> 01:03.595
You know, it's funny.

01:03.597 --> 01:05.564
You keep so busy
with your kids,

01:05.566 --> 01:07.099
time just seems
to slip away,

01:07.101 --> 01:09.334
and then you turn
around one day and...

01:09.336 --> 01:11.103
Okay, bye.
Stop making noise.

01:11.105 --> 01:13.272
(sighs)

01:14.441 --> 01:16.241
You know, Peter, I know
Lois is downplaying it,

01:16.243 --> 01:18.210
but I think she might
actually appreciate it

01:18.212 --> 01:19.511
if we threw her
a party.

01:19.513 --> 01:21.180
Maybe even
a surprise party.

01:21.182 --> 01:22.781
That's a great
idea, Brian!

01:22.783 --> 01:24.049
Yeah, I love parties.

01:24.051 --> 01:26.285
I mean, I had a great time
at my baby shower.

01:26.287 --> 01:28.187
Well, after opening all
these gifts,

01:28.189 --> 01:30.089
I could use a little wine
right now myself.

01:30.091 --> 01:31.790
(chuckles) Glug,
glug, glug, glug.

01:31.792 --> 01:34.226
Can you imagine?!
(laughs)

01:34.228 --> 01:36.228
(sobbing)

01:36.230 --> 01:40.165
I'm sorry. My hormones are
just crazy right now!

01:44.938 --> 01:47.539
(both laughing)

01:49.742 --> 01:52.111
Stewie, you want
a Mommy rocket ride?

01:52.113 --> 01:53.378
What?
What do you mean?

01:53.380 --> 01:55.114
Here we go!
Get ready for blastoff!

01:55.116 --> 01:56.115
(bone cracks)

01:56.117 --> 01:57.749
Ow! Son of a bitch!

01:57.751 --> 02:00.719
Oh, my God, Stewie,
are you all right?

02:00.721 --> 02:03.355
Nice throw,
Casey Anthony.

02:04.657 --> 02:07.426
Oh, my God, I hope the guys
at Sears portrait studio

02:07.428 --> 02:09.294
will be able to retouch this.

02:09.296 --> 02:10.496
What am I saying?

02:10.498 --> 02:12.798
Of course they will.
They're Sears.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.233
What the deuce?

02:14.235 --> 02:15.567
Well, hello there.

02:15.569 --> 02:17.503
I say, you're
a cute little fellow.

02:17.505 --> 02:20.672
Tell me something: What do you
think about Rose McGowan?

02:20.674 --> 02:22.774
Yeah, she makes
my turtlehead go in, too.

02:22.776 --> 02:24.676
How about Michelle Rodriguez?

02:24.678 --> 02:26.411
Yeah, me too, kinda, right?

02:26.413 --> 02:28.313
You know, she's got
like a cute tomboy thing

02:28.315 --> 02:30.649
where you feel like you could
play softball with her,

02:30.651 --> 02:32.851
and then later on,
give her the old sau-seege.

02:32.853 --> 02:34.153
I like you.

02:34.155 --> 02:36.288
I can tell we're going
to be good friends.

02:36.290 --> 02:39.725
We've got that unspoken bond
that all bald guys have.

02:42.362 --> 02:43.829
I thought
he'd never leave.

02:43.831 --> 02:45.097
Me neither.

02:45.099 --> 02:46.398
(slurping)

02:48.768 --> 02:50.502
(both sigh)

02:50.504 --> 02:51.570
Yeah.

02:53.106 --> 02:55.240
Aw, did you guys
just do the thing?

02:58.611 --> 03:01.180
Okay, we'll see you soon.
Bye. All right, you guys,

03:01.182 --> 03:03.782
that was Lois. She's gonna be
here in ten minutes.

03:03.784 --> 03:06.218
Dad, how did you get Mom out of
the house so we could decorate?

03:06.220 --> 03:08.020
Well, Chris, I constructed

03:08.022 --> 03:10.756
a very elaborate
fake grocery store.

03:11.357 --> 03:12.457
Oh, my God!

03:12.459 --> 03:14.860
Are these pickles really
only 39 cents?!

03:14.862 --> 03:15.961
That's right, ma'am.

03:15.963 --> 03:18.564
Wow! This is incredible!

03:19.899 --> 03:22.134
(wind whistling)

03:22.136 --> 03:24.570
What the hell's
going on here?

03:28.141 --> 03:29.975
And over here are my toys.

03:29.977 --> 03:32.578
This is my fire truck,
my Slinky, my Silly Putty.

03:32.580 --> 03:34.179
You know, Silly Putty's
awesome,

03:34.181 --> 03:37.149
but you know what's
really cool? Serious Putty.

03:37.151 --> 03:40.018
Oh, this looks
like fun!

03:40.020 --> 03:42.387
It says I have cancer.

03:42.389 --> 03:44.323
We thought it would be better

03:44.325 --> 03:46.258
if you heard it
from chemicals in an egg.

03:46.260 --> 03:47.226
Hey, Stewie,
you better come down.

03:47.228 --> 03:48.227
The party's
about to start.

03:48.229 --> 03:50.362
What is that?
Is that a turtle?

03:50.364 --> 03:52.164
Yes, Brian.
I found him at the park.

03:52.166 --> 03:53.565
I named him Sheldon.

03:53.567 --> 03:55.767
Oh, and get this:
I brought him home today,

03:55.769 --> 03:57.703
and coincidentally
this is the day

03:57.705 --> 03:59.571
Rupert started
working out again.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.340
So transparent.

04:01.342 --> 04:03.342
Rupert?
What happened to your eye?

04:03.344 --> 04:05.210
Brian, did you pull
one of Rupert's eyes off?

04:05.212 --> 04:06.878
No. Why would I do that?

04:06.880 --> 04:08.213
Maybe your
turtle did it.

04:08.215 --> 04:09.748
Nonsense. Sheldon
is a gentle soul.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.116
He wouldn't hurt anybody.

04:11.118 --> 04:12.584
Well, come on.
Let's get downstairs.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.119
Lois will be here
any minute.

04:31.070 --> 04:32.938
ALL:
Surprise!

04:32.940 --> 04:34.940
Yay!
Birthday!

04:34.942 --> 04:36.642
Oh, my God!

04:36.644 --> 04:38.076
Happy birthday,
Lois!

04:38.078 --> 04:39.745
You guys shouldn't
have done this!

04:39.747 --> 04:42.714
Hey, anytime you can celebrate
the end of someone's periods.

04:42.716 --> 04:45.150
Everyone, everyone,
I have something to say.

04:45.152 --> 04:48.720
To my dearest Lois
on her birthday.

04:48.722 --> 04:50.822
What a journey
we've had together.

04:50.824 --> 04:53.825
You know, life has a way
of changing things.

04:53.827 --> 04:56.561
What were once two firm,
impressive mountain peaks

04:56.563 --> 04:59.464
have become a barren,
strip-mined, muddy landslide

04:59.466 --> 05:01.266
that droops ever downward.

05:01.268 --> 05:04.069
What were once pink
and succulent rose petals

05:04.071 --> 05:06.438
now take the form
of the shredded, raggedy,

05:06.440 --> 05:10.242
blown-out endpiece
of a practical joker's
exploding cigar.

05:10.244 --> 05:11.410
Peter, that-
that's enough.

05:11.412 --> 05:12.978
Lois, you may not be

05:12.980 --> 05:14.780
the young filly you were
when I met you,

05:14.782 --> 05:17.349
but you're still my
reliable old plow horse

05:17.351 --> 05:18.483
who's there each day

05:18.485 --> 05:20.452
to pull the plow,
to help around the barn,

05:20.454 --> 05:23.755
and let the husband horse-slap
a batch at her now and then.

05:23.757 --> 05:26.024
Well, I guess that's it.

05:26.026 --> 05:27.326
I love you, sweetheart.

05:27.328 --> 05:30.128
And I have a lovely gift
of the batchslapping variety

05:30.130 --> 05:32.364
waiting for you when I'm just
the right amount of drunk.

05:32.366 --> 05:33.365
To Lois!

05:33.367 --> 05:34.700
ALL:
To Lois!

05:36.436 --> 05:38.770
(sobbing, door shuts)

05:38.772 --> 05:40.272
Lois!
Mom!

05:40.274 --> 05:41.707
Geez, what the hell's
her problem?

05:41.709 --> 05:43.642
Peter, she was already
feeling insecure about her age,

05:43.644 --> 05:46.011
and then you went and gave her
that horrible speech!

05:46.013 --> 05:47.145
I don't blame her.

05:47.147 --> 05:49.214
Nobody likes to be
humiliated in public.

05:49.216 --> 05:50.482
I'm King Stewie!

05:50.484 --> 05:52.451
I rule with
an iron fist!

05:52.453 --> 05:56.054
La, la-la, la-la la-la!
Look at me! Ooh!

05:56.056 --> 05:58.357
In my office. Now.

06:01.728 --> 06:03.328
Hey, any of you guys
seen your mother?

06:03.330 --> 06:04.663
She never came
to bed last night,

06:04.665 --> 06:05.964
and I can't find
her anywhere.

06:05.966 --> 06:07.165
(car horn beeps)

06:07.167 --> 06:09.134
What the hell?

06:09.136 --> 06:13.405
♪

06:17.410 --> 06:20.479
Hey, sluts!

06:20.481 --> 06:23.315
OMG, stop staring at me,
please-'kay-thanks.

06:23.317 --> 06:25.183
Mom, are you okay?

06:25.185 --> 06:26.585
Lois, what's goin' on?

06:26.587 --> 06:28.487
I'm what's
goin' on, Peter.

06:28.489 --> 06:30.489
I got highlights,
I went shopping,

06:30.491 --> 06:32.190
and I had my...

06:32.192 --> 06:35.193
So it's tighter now.

06:35.195 --> 06:38.363
Peter, I think Lois might be
having a midlife crisis.

06:38.365 --> 06:41.266
Come on, dudes!
Who wants to hop in my wheels

06:41.268 --> 06:44.102
and head to the beach
for some ultimate Frisbee?

06:45.004 --> 06:47.506
Yeah, Sheldon, I'm with you.

06:52.445 --> 06:54.613
I can't... I can't do that.

07:00.386 --> 07:02.854
Hey, tweeps!

07:02.856 --> 07:04.523
JK, I don't follow you,
you're lame.

07:04.525 --> 07:07.692
But look who just got
herself a sick new tat.

07:07.694 --> 07:09.728
MEG:
Oh, my God, Mom!

07:09.730 --> 07:11.763
I know,
I can't believe it either.

07:11.765 --> 07:14.699
I guess one of my flaws
is I'm just kinda brave.

07:14.701 --> 07:16.301
No, that's great actually,
because now

07:16.303 --> 07:19.604
anyone walking behind you
will know that you had $60.

07:19.606 --> 07:21.306
Wow! That is awesome, Lois!

07:21.308 --> 07:23.041
Your bum looks like
an NBA guy's arm.

07:23.043 --> 07:25.043
'Cept it's not payin'
someone to install

07:25.045 --> 07:26.711
a PlayStation in a car.

07:26.713 --> 07:28.580
Lois, you do know
that's permanent?

07:28.582 --> 07:29.614
Good. Then that means

07:29.616 --> 07:32.050
my ass is gonna
look young forever.

07:34.120 --> 07:39.324
Guys, I, uh, I gotta go
shoot one into the sink.

07:39.326 --> 07:40.592
What's going on?

07:40.594 --> 07:42.561
Mom's acting and dressing
like a 20-year-old.

07:42.563 --> 07:44.296
I know, and I'm
worried about her.

07:44.298 --> 07:46.431
You can't just pretend
to be something you're not.

07:46.433 --> 07:48.433
Yes, just ask
Edward Scissorhands.

07:48.435 --> 07:52.003
Okay, now, I'm an excellent
night nurse, so you two get

07:52.005 --> 07:55.140
some much-deserved sleep
and don't worry about a thing.

07:55.142 --> 07:58.443
I will take such loving care
of this wonderful little gift.

07:58.445 --> 08:00.345
And when you wake up,
well-rested,

08:00.347 --> 08:02.848
your precious little baby
will be smiling

08:02.850 --> 08:04.516
as bright as the sun.

08:06.319 --> 08:07.652
It's dead.

08:10.923 --> 08:13.258
And while I remind you
I can't read yet,

08:13.260 --> 08:15.160
I can only imagine
Madeline would say,

08:15.162 --> 08:17.629
"Take me out of this
disgusting French hospital

08:17.631 --> 08:19.097
and find me some
real parents."

08:19.099 --> 08:21.266
Ah! Paper cut!

08:21.268 --> 08:22.667
A razor blade?!

08:22.669 --> 08:26.238
Who the hell uses a razor blade
as a bookmark?!

08:28.107 --> 08:30.008
All right,
very funny, Stewie.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.276
What?
What do you mean, what?

08:31.278 --> 08:33.612
You replaced my Jack Daniels
with flat Diet Coke.

08:33.614 --> 08:34.946
No, I didn't.

08:34.948 --> 08:37.315
And you're noticing this
at 8:20 in the morning?

08:37.317 --> 08:38.617
What has happened
to your life?

08:38.619 --> 08:40.018
Do you need to talk?

08:40.020 --> 08:41.453
Just stay away
from my booze!

08:41.455 --> 08:42.654
It wasn't me, Brian.

08:42.656 --> 08:43.955
Well, if it wasn't you,
who was it?

08:43.957 --> 08:45.290
I mean, there's a lot
of weird stuff

08:45.292 --> 08:48.527
Just yesterday, somebody gave
Peter a "hotbutt."

08:48.529 --> 08:50.829
♪ La, la, la, la, la,
regular life ♪

08:50.831 --> 08:53.198
♪ La, la, la, la,
la, la, la, la, l... ♪

08:53.200 --> 08:56.067
And then somebody replaced
Meg's sleeping pills

08:56.069 --> 08:57.536
with Alka-Seltzer.

08:59.505 --> 09:01.640
People are gonna miss me
when I'm...

09:01.642 --> 09:04.209
(belching)

09:04.211 --> 09:06.211
Well, I'm sure there's a
perfectly logical explanation

09:06.213 --> 09:07.312
for those things.

09:07.314 --> 09:09.047
Sometimes you just...

09:09.049 --> 09:11.149
Whoa, that was close.

09:11.151 --> 09:13.652
Yeah, how'd
that thing fall over?

09:18.658 --> 09:21.159
Okay, who replaced
my glasses with forks?

09:21.161 --> 09:22.727
I mean, they're real good
for seeing forks

09:22.729 --> 09:24.396
but not much else.

09:27.366 --> 09:30.101
LOIS:
Peter, can you come down
to the laundry room?

09:30.103 --> 09:31.269
Ugh, son of a bitch.

09:31.271 --> 09:33.004
If she washed
my belt again,

09:33.006 --> 09:35.840
I am gonna hit her
with my dry, withered belt.

09:35.842 --> 09:37.075
What is it, Lois?

09:37.077 --> 09:38.209
I was watching...

09:38.211 --> 09:42.080
Whoa, Lois, what the
hell are you doing?

09:42.082 --> 09:45.350
Do me, Peter, do me right here
in the basement.

09:45.352 --> 09:48.520
Y-You mean this room we're in
or your bum?

09:48.522 --> 09:51.690
No, this room, Peter,
right here on the carpet.

09:51.692 --> 09:52.958
Oh, so you mean the front.

09:52.960 --> 09:54.726
Just get over here
and kiss me.

09:54.728 --> 09:57.896
Let's have sex on all
the clean, folded laundry.

09:57.898 --> 10:00.599
Wow, Lois, I got to say,
I like this new you.

10:00.601 --> 10:01.866
I like it a lot.

10:01.868 --> 10:03.735
(both giggling)

10:03.737 --> 10:06.237
Oh, Peter!

10:06.239 --> 10:08.106
Oh, Peter, yes!
Yeah.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.708
Oh, I'm on fire.
Yeah.

10:09.710 --> 10:11.776
Take me, you
filthy bastard.
Yeah, oh.

10:11.778 --> 10:13.378
Destroy me and
this laundry.
Oh, yeah.

10:13.380 --> 10:15.614
Yeah, here, put Meg's
bra in your mouth.

10:15.616 --> 10:17.616
Oh, my God,
that's so disturbing.

10:17.618 --> 10:19.284
I know, gross.

10:19.286 --> 10:20.552
Yeah, and my hearing's
a lot better,

10:20.554 --> 10:23.221
so I hear, like,

11:36.530 --> 11:38.530
Get back in your bowl
where you belong.

11:42.234 --> 11:46.471
Well, long as I'm up, I might
as well go spit in Lois's mouth.

11:49.041 --> 11:51.276
Sheldon?

11:55.881 --> 11:57.515
(gasps)

11:57.517 --> 11:58.950
(panting)

12:01.353 --> 12:02.587
Come on, Stewie.

12:02.589 --> 12:04.489
He's just a little turtle.

12:04.491 --> 12:06.591
He can't hurt you.

12:27.214 --> 12:29.614
Get out!

12:34.620 --> 12:36.755
(chirping)

12:44.430 --> 12:46.131
(squawking)

12:46.133 --> 12:47.632
(neck snaps)

12:53.439 --> 12:55.507
(dance music playing)

12:58.544 --> 12:59.811
Isn't this epic, Peter?

12:59.813 --> 13:02.213
That DJ has got
some mad skills.

13:02.215 --> 13:04.382
(sighs) You think they
sell Anacin at the bar?

13:04.384 --> 13:05.416
Come on.

13:05.418 --> 13:07.285
Get up and dance
with me, Peter.

13:07.287 --> 13:08.486
This place is sick.

13:08.488 --> 13:09.621
Hells yeah!

13:09.623 --> 13:12.223
It is the only
rooftop pool in Providence.

13:12.225 --> 13:14.425
No offense, but this
place is awesome.

13:14.427 --> 13:16.427
I-I-- Where was
I supposed to be offended

13:16.429 --> 13:17.462
within that remark?

13:17.464 --> 13:18.797
Can we, can we leave, Lois?

13:18.799 --> 13:20.498
Actually, we are leaving.

13:20.500 --> 13:22.667
We're hitting another
insane party across town.

13:22.669 --> 13:24.102
What, you mean now?

13:24.104 --> 13:26.171
Peter, you sound
like an old fart.

13:26.173 --> 13:28.606
I thought you liked
having a hot, young wife.

13:28.608 --> 13:31.442
Well, I did at first,
but the novelty's worn off.

13:31.444 --> 13:34.512
Same thing happened with
that blog I started on 9/11.

13:47.526 --> 13:49.460
Look, Peter,
you do what you want to do,

13:49.462 --> 13:51.029
but I'm going to that party.

13:51.031 --> 13:53.298
My life isn't over.
It's just beginning.

13:53.300 --> 13:55.667
So if you don't want
to run with the wild horses,

13:55.669 --> 13:58.536
then go back to the barn
and go to bed.

13:58.538 --> 14:01.005
But, Lois...

14:03.642 --> 14:05.977
Stupid place still doesn't
have my dry cleaning.

14:05.979 --> 14:08.513
That's not a dry cleaners.
It's a dance club.

14:08.515 --> 14:09.480
It is?

14:09.482 --> 14:11.883
Well, that explains a lot.

14:12.852 --> 14:13.952
(phone ringing)

14:13.954 --> 14:16.020
Oh, this is my jam!

14:23.729 --> 14:26.197
Jeez, Peter, you
look terrible.

14:26.199 --> 14:27.699
I know.
Lois has been wearing me out.

14:27.701 --> 14:29.300
I just can't keep up with her.

14:29.302 --> 14:31.002
I don't know what
she's trying to prove, Brian,

14:31.004 --> 14:32.303
but I can't take it anymore.

14:32.305 --> 14:33.471
Peter, can't you see?

14:33.473 --> 14:34.739
She's doing this
because of <i>you.</i>

14:34.741 --> 14:36.741
For God's sake, you
called her a plow horse.

14:36.743 --> 14:39.244
It's no wonder she's trying to
prove she's young and vibrant.

14:39.246 --> 14:40.712
(over TV):
Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker.

14:40.714 --> 14:42.513
The city of Quahog
has been stricken

14:42.515 --> 14:44.382
with a case of Bieber Fever
tonight,

14:44.384 --> 14:47.318
as teen idol and fake black guy
Justin Bieber

14:47.320 --> 14:49.687
is in town for a sold-out show
at the Quahog Civic Center.

14:49.689 --> 14:51.189
We now go live

14:51.191 --> 14:53.424
to Asian correspondent
Tricia Takanawa with more.

14:53.426 --> 14:55.093
(girls screaming)
Tom, I'm standing here

14:55.095 --> 14:56.694
at the Quahog Civic Center,

14:56.696 --> 15:00.531
awash in a pool
of prepubescent sexual moisture.

15:00.533 --> 15:03.501
Woo-hoo!
We love you, Justin!

15:03.503 --> 15:04.836
Look!
That's Mom!

15:04.838 --> 15:06.504
Oh, my God!
What the hell?

15:06.506 --> 15:07.872
She's at
a Justin Bieber concert?

15:07.874 --> 15:10.108
Ugh, Justin Bieber's
so yesterday.

15:10.110 --> 15:12.210
I'm all about
Quentin Vashay now.

15:12.212 --> 15:13.678
Who's Quentin Vashay?

15:13.680 --> 15:15.113
Exactly.

15:15.115 --> 15:16.114
What's going on?

15:16.116 --> 15:18.116
Do we have to get
a new mom now?

15:18.118 --> 15:19.183
No, Chris.

15:19.185 --> 15:21.219
I'm gonna go get
our old mom back.

15:21.221 --> 15:23.221
If I'm the one
who made her feel this way,

15:23.223 --> 15:25.056
then I'm the one
who's got to fix it.

15:25.058 --> 15:26.557
Brian, keys!

15:26.559 --> 15:28.092
Chris, beer!

15:28.094 --> 15:30.161
Meg, ugly!

15:32.264 --> 15:34.032
Mm-hmm. Yes.

15:34.034 --> 15:35.400
Yes, I see.

15:35.402 --> 15:37.035
Rupert, the man
from the newspaper

15:37.037 --> 15:39.470
would like a quote from you
about my dancing abilities.

15:39.472 --> 15:40.905
Rupert?

15:40.907 --> 15:43.141
Where'd you go?

15:43.143 --> 15:45.276
Magnolia Cupcakes?

15:47.046 --> 15:48.046
(screams)

15:48.048 --> 15:49.280
Rupert! Oh, my God!

15:49.282 --> 15:50.815
Oh, my God, no!

15:50.817 --> 15:53.284
If he did this to you,
I swear I'll kill him!

15:53.286 --> 15:56.354
And what's that box from
Bloomingdale's doing here?

15:58.657 --> 16:02.260
I, uh, I-I don't know
who this is.

16:02.262 --> 16:05.363
(crowd cheering)

16:10.102 --> 16:12.804
(women screaming)

16:12.806 --> 16:15.273
Oh, my God, he is so adorable.

16:15.275 --> 16:17.241
I could just bite him
and eat him up.

16:17.243 --> 16:18.943
I know, he's perfect.

16:18.945 --> 16:20.511
He's like a boy
and a girl.

16:20.513 --> 16:22.013
I know!

16:22.015 --> 16:24.549
(women screaming)

16:29.455 --> 16:30.955
Sorry, you're not
allowed in here.

16:30.957 --> 16:32.256
Oh, yeah?

16:33.158 --> 16:34.959
I'm not into that.

16:34.961 --> 16:36.027
Oh.

16:36.029 --> 16:37.762
Well, what
are you into?

16:37.764 --> 16:39.263
Pinkberry.

16:39.265 --> 16:40.331
I love my job.

16:40.333 --> 16:43.034
Yum, yum, yum, yum,
yum, yum, yum, yum.

16:45.137 --> 16:47.038
Hey, there, cutie.

16:47.040 --> 16:48.873
Oh, hey. How's it going?

16:48.875 --> 16:50.842
Um, are you a friend
of my mom's?

16:50.844 --> 16:52.176
(chuckles)

16:52.178 --> 16:55.713
Yeah. I'm your mom's friend,
Mrs. Robinson.

16:55.715 --> 16:57.215
I don't... I don't get that.

16:57.217 --> 16:58.683
Is that a reference
to something?

16:58.685 --> 16:59.984
Uh, okay.

16:59.986 --> 17:02.620
Uh, I'm, uh-- oh,
I'm Stifler's mom.

17:02.622 --> 17:04.222
Still no idea.

17:04.224 --> 17:06.157
Okay, just get
your pants off, hon.

17:06.159 --> 17:08.026
Stop right there!
Get away from her!

17:08.028 --> 17:09.160
Peter?!
Who are you?

17:09.162 --> 17:13.464
Step away from my wife,
you acorn-penised beauty!

17:13.466 --> 17:15.199
Look, I swear.
Nothing happened.

17:15.201 --> 17:16.501
Just relax, old man.

17:16.503 --> 17:18.136
Old man?!

17:18.138 --> 17:21.305
What, you think you're not gonna
get old, you little bastard?!

17:21.307 --> 17:23.241
And, Lois, I've had
enough of you, too!

17:23.243 --> 17:25.343
Now, you come home
and start acting your age!

17:25.345 --> 17:27.311
No, Peter. I don't
want to act my age,

17:27.313 --> 17:28.913
and you don't
want that either.

17:28.915 --> 17:31.549
Otherwise, you wouldn't have
called me an old plow horse.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.317
Look, I didn't mean
to say that.

17:33.319 --> 17:34.318
I-I was a jerk.

17:34.320 --> 17:36.254
But isn't this
what you want?

17:36.256 --> 17:38.523
Don't you want me to
stay young and exciting?

17:38.525 --> 17:39.857
Well, I thought I did.

17:39.859 --> 17:41.659
I mean, every guy
who's been married a while

17:41.661 --> 17:43.194
thinks he wants
a hot, young chick,

17:43.196 --> 17:45.096
but after you spend an hour
with one of them,

17:45.098 --> 17:46.364
you want to blow
your brains out.

17:46.366 --> 17:49.667
But, Peter, I was just
doing this to make you happy.

17:49.669 --> 17:51.335
You do make me happy, Lois.

17:51.337 --> 17:53.838
You're the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

17:53.840 --> 17:55.206
That's sweet.

17:55.208 --> 17:57.909
But you got to admit,
I'm not what I used to be.

17:57.911 --> 17:59.077
Well, neither am I.

17:59.079 --> 18:00.711
(roars)

18:00.713 --> 18:02.346
I used to be
a lion tamer.

18:02.348 --> 18:04.549
Look, Lois,
I'll always treasure

18:04.551 --> 18:07.285
the wild, little hottie
I met when I was young.

18:07.287 --> 18:09.253
But I don't want to be
with a kid anymore.

18:09.255 --> 18:13.091
I want a smart, sexy, beautiful,
middle-aged companion.

18:13.093 --> 18:14.892
I want the real Lois.

18:14.894 --> 18:16.127
My Lois.

18:16.129 --> 18:17.862
Oh, Peter.

18:21.066 --> 18:24.368
Mr. Bieber, they're
calling for an encore!

18:25.704 --> 18:28.139
Oh, my God, those kids
are expecting a show.

18:28.141 --> 18:29.307
I'll handle this.

18:29.309 --> 18:31.442
(crowd cheering)

18:33.378 --> 18:37.081
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Conway Bieber.

It's not an exciting life,
but it's my life.

20:37.569 --> 20:39.737
It sure is good to
have you back, Mom.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.505
Yeah, we missed you.

20:41.507 --> 20:43.407
Well, thanks for putting up
with me, you guys.

20:43.409 --> 20:46.210
Sorry I got so flipped out
about my age.

20:46.212 --> 20:47.678
Aw, don't worry
about it, Lois.

20:47.680 --> 20:49.247
But from now on,
remember:

20:49.249 --> 20:51.515
