00:10.760 --> 00:13.555
<i>Previously on </i>Riverdale:

00:13.638 --> 00:15.765
Joseph Svenson was troubled.

00:15.849 --> 00:19.185
Do you think we got
the right guy? I'm not sure we did.

00:20.186 --> 00:23.273
I've looked into the Black Hood's eyes.
It's not him.

00:23.356 --> 00:27.318
-Come on, V. You were all over me.
-We're old friends. Nick, stop!

00:27.402 --> 00:30.196
I'm making a behind-the-scenes
of <i>Carrie: The Musical</i>.

00:30.280 --> 00:33.116
I found a letter from someone alleging
to be the Black Hood.

00:33.199 --> 00:34.617
It's a prank. Look.

00:34.701 --> 00:36.703
It was Ethel.
-Get out of my room.

00:36.786 --> 00:38.204
Somebody help.

00:38.288 --> 00:39.622
For God's sake, help!

<i>The angel of death</i>

01:22.248 --> 01:25.585
<i>Midge Klump's gruesome murder</i>
<i>had gutted the entire town.</i>

01:25.668 --> 01:28.755
<i>And in grief, brought us together.</i>

01:31.007 --> 01:33.343
<i> You were shooting a documentary?</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:34.594 --> 01:37.055
It was a behind-the-scenes sort of thing.

01:39.015 --> 01:43.269
Look, sheriff, you have my footage, okay?
All of it's right there.

01:43.812 --> 01:46.689
Everything was fine
until those letters started to show up.

01:46.773 --> 01:50.485
-Threats to recast Cheryl.
What letters?

01:50.568 --> 01:52.237
I was jealous, okay?

01:53.321 --> 01:56.241
Cheryl always gets everything she wants.

01:58.201 --> 02:00.662
But I wasn't gonna hurt anybody.

02:01.955 --> 02:03.873
I just wanted the part.

02:04.415 --> 02:07.669
Moose, do you remember
the last thing you said to Midge?

02:08.962 --> 02:11.464
I don't remember exactly. Uh...

02:11.798 --> 02:15.385
She was-- She was my girlfriend.
We said a lot of things.

02:15.885 --> 02:18.138
Probably it was something casual or...

02:18.847 --> 02:20.306
Just-- Just stupid.

02:21.724 --> 02:23.977
-Sure.

02:26.062 --> 02:29.190
Did you ever find any evidence
that linked Mr. Svenson

02:29.274 --> 02:30.483
to the Black Hood attacks?

02:32.318 --> 02:33.736
Maybe we got it wrong.

02:34.320 --> 02:35.280
-Maybe--
-Archie.

02:35.363 --> 02:37.740
Svenson almost buried you alive.

02:37.824 --> 02:39.576
He was wearing a black hood.

02:39.659 --> 02:42.704
Something always felt wrong
about what happened on the bridge.

02:43.580 --> 02:44.747
Now Midge is dead.

02:44.831 --> 02:47.709
We're going to get her killer,
whoever he is.

02:48.126 --> 02:50.962
But, Archie, Svenson was the Black Hood.

02:52.255 --> 02:59.262
<i>♪ You'll never walk ♪</i> <i>♪ Alone ♪</i>

03:16.738 --> 03:19.324
I also feel it is my duty to say that...

03:20.450 --> 03:22.452
like the Furies of Ancient Greece,

03:22.535 --> 03:26.080
who pursue blood atonement
when a crime's committed,

03:26.164 --> 03:28.666
the Vixens and I vow that we will not rest

03:28.750 --> 03:31.961
until those responsible
for the murder of our sister...

03:32.670 --> 03:34.005
is rightly punished.

03:43.514 --> 03:44.682
Mrs. Klump?

03:47.560 --> 03:49.896
I wanted you to know
the department is working--

03:51.064 --> 03:53.233
You were supposed
to be protecting our children. You should be ashamed of yourself.

03:59.322 --> 04:01.241
Your days of failing this town

04:01.324 --> 04:03.076
over and over again

04:03.660 --> 04:06.079
are numbered, sheriff.

04:13.294 --> 04:14.420
<i>I have a theory.</i>

04:15.546 --> 04:16.756
It's a copycat killer.

04:17.840 --> 04:21.261
And who coincidentally showed up
in Riverdale after Mr. Svenson was killed?

04:21.344 --> 04:23.471
And has been giving us
creepy vibes ever since?

04:25.723 --> 04:28.101
Chic. He has a temper, too.

04:28.184 --> 04:32.605
Chic is here because I went
to the hostel to get him.

04:33.564 --> 04:35.858
And, yes, he's weird,
but he didn't know Midge.

04:36.442 --> 04:39.988
-So, moving on.

04:41.614 --> 04:43.324
Archie, we were there when he died.

04:43.408 --> 04:46.327
I know, but just because
he was wearing a hood that night,

04:46.411 --> 04:49.205
it doesn't necessarily mean
he's the same guy who shot my dad.

04:50.206 --> 04:51.332
And now killed Midge.

04:52.417 --> 04:55.878
Svenson forced me to bury you alive.

04:55.962 --> 04:58.131
He cut off his own finger
and sent it to me.

04:58.214 --> 05:00.758
Maybe the real Black Hood was working
with Svenson.

05:00.842 --> 05:03.803
And Svenson would have
let himself be mutilated?

05:03.886 --> 05:07.432
Look, all I'm trying to say is
the real Black Hood could still be alive.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.978
I looked into the Black Hood's eyes.

05:15.398 --> 05:17.150
They weren't Mr. Svenson's eyes.

05:18.609 --> 05:21.404
Betty, how do we know
that Chic had nothing to do with Midge?

05:21.487 --> 05:24.699
This is the same guy that killed someone
in your kitchen using a lamp.

05:24.782 --> 05:27.910
Yeah, well, Chic did that for a reason.
To protect my mom.

05:28.494 --> 05:31.414
He didn't even know Midge.
What motive would he have to kill her?

05:31.956 --> 05:34.667
I don't know.
But he does have a violent past

05:34.751 --> 05:36.669
and associates with violent people.

05:38.796 --> 05:40.006
<i>Are you okay?</i>

05:41.591 --> 05:43.342
Whether or not the Black Hood is back,

05:43.426 --> 05:45.553
I don't want
Death Wish Archie to come back.

05:45.636 --> 05:48.222
You saw that note, Veronica.
Written in Midge's blood.

05:48.723 --> 05:51.434
If the Black Hood is going
after victims who escaped him...

05:52.518 --> 05:53.936
my dad is next.

05:54.437 --> 05:57.440
Or Moose. Or Betty. Or you. Or me.
It could be anyone.

05:57.523 --> 06:01.778
That's exactly why I need you sane
and steady right now.

06:01.861 --> 06:02.695
I am.

06:04.030 --> 06:07.408
-I will be.
-Promise me, you won't patrol the streets.

06:07.492 --> 06:10.203
-Or break into Svenson's house--
-Ronnie.

06:10.828 --> 06:11.746
It's just--

06:13.081 --> 06:16.626
I can't bear the thought
of anything bad happening to you.

06:26.052 --> 06:27.762
Sheriff. What can I do for you?

06:27.845 --> 06:32.183
Hey. I'm talking to everyone who was at
Riverdale High the night of the musical.

06:32.767 --> 06:35.978
I haven't had a chance
to talk to your son yet. Chic?

06:36.062 --> 06:40.191
-People said they saw him backstage--
-Chic doesn't live here anymore.

06:40.274 --> 06:42.693
But we'll bring him down tomorrow.

06:43.444 --> 06:45.029
Sure. Thanks, Hal.

06:45.113 --> 06:47.532
Thanks, Alice. Betty. Have a good evening.

06:49.075 --> 06:51.536
What are you doing throwing Chic
under the bus?

06:51.619 --> 06:53.621
What are you worried he'll say?

06:54.831 --> 06:57.500
Mom's just overprotective of Chic.
That's all.

07:21.357 --> 07:22.191
Hello?

07:57.059 --> 07:59.187
You look like you had a rough night.

08:03.441 --> 08:06.027
I can't stop thinking
about what the Black Hood wrote.

08:06.611 --> 08:09.447
"All those who escaped me before
will die."

08:10.031 --> 08:13.075
Maybe you should leave town.
Go stay with Mom.

08:13.159 --> 08:16.913
Uh
Here

08:18.414 --> 08:22.335
-Keller put a deputy outside.
-Midge was murdered in an auditorium.

08:22.418 --> 08:24.921
You think a deputy can stop
the Black Hood?

08:25.505 --> 08:27.548
With crisis comes opportunity.

08:27.632 --> 08:31.636
On that note, I'll be going door-to-door
to reassure the citizens

08:31.719 --> 08:35.097
-that the Lodges put safety first.
-Unlike Sheriff Keller.

08:36.349 --> 08:38.851
<i>Mija</i>, you're friends with Cheryl Blossom.

08:38.935 --> 08:42.313
It seemed like she was taking
Midge's death hard.

08:42.396 --> 08:44.065
Okay, Dad, Mom...

08:44.815 --> 08:48.319
whatever you're getting at, forget it.

08:48.402 --> 08:51.364
Count me out of whatever schemes
you're cooking up.

08:56.702 --> 08:58.287
Hey, Mom. Wait.

08:59.330 --> 09:01.666
Don't get mad at what I'm about to ask.

09:01.749 --> 09:04.627
But do you think
maybe Chic should leave town?

09:06.963 --> 09:11.092
-He's giving a statement.
-What if Sheriff Keller presses Chic

09:11.175 --> 09:15.137
and he starts blabbing
about other bad things that he's done?

09:15.221 --> 09:18.724
If Chic leaves, he looks guilty
and they'll hunt him down.

09:19.225 --> 09:23.271
So, yes, it's a risk, but relax, Betty.
I'm gonna coach him myself.

09:24.063 --> 09:27.692
<i>Maybe we should look into Chic.</i>

09:27.775 --> 09:31.320
Not yet. There's something
that could connect him to Svenson.

09:31.404 --> 09:34.490
It's tenuous, but they both spent time
at the Sisters of Quiet Mercy.

09:35.199 --> 09:38.619
Archie's theories about there being
multiple Black Hoods...

09:40.079 --> 09:41.581
They could be in cahoots.

09:41.956 --> 09:46.627
It's a long shot. Mr. Svenson's older
than Chic, but he worked there for years.

09:48.087 --> 09:50.089
-They might have crossed paths.
-Yeah.

09:50.172 --> 09:51.382
It's worth a visit.

09:51.465 --> 09:52.550
<i></i>

09:54.260 --> 09:56.929
Mrs. Lodge. What a surprise.

09:59.390 --> 10:03.561
You know, I was very moved
by the speech you gave at Midge's funeral.

10:03.644 --> 10:05.646
It came from the core of my bosom.

10:05.938 --> 10:10.234
It's a travesty what happened.
If only we had competent law enforcement.

10:10.318 --> 10:13.571
Well, I was in the middle
of writing an editorial...

10:14.322 --> 10:18.451
calling for Keller's head,
but seeing your passion for the subject,

10:18.534 --> 10:21.245
I thought you'd be willing
to write an op-ed.

10:22.830 --> 10:23.706
Say no more.

10:24.040 --> 10:25.875
So, we meet again, Miss Cooper.

10:25.958 --> 10:29.045
We need information
about my brother, Charles.

10:29.128 --> 10:32.632
Do you know if Charles's time here
overlapped with Mr. Svenson's?

10:33.090 --> 10:36.761
-He was your groundskeeper.
-I'm aware of who Mr. Svenson was.

10:37.219 --> 10:39.388
And what he became.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.974
Could we check Charles's files
to see if the dates match?

10:43.434 --> 10:46.312
I'm sure you have a court order
demanding such a request?

10:48.397 --> 10:49.774
No, we don't.

10:49.857 --> 10:53.319
But I am cousins with Cheryl Blossom,

10:53.402 --> 10:57.239
who recently escaped
your secret gay-reeducation camp.

10:57.323 --> 11:01.077
So, unless you cooperate,
we'll be back with a court order

11:01.160 --> 11:04.205
and the FBI, to shut you down.

11:05.915 --> 11:08.501
Apparently,
Charles ran away nine years ago.

11:08.584 --> 11:12.338
That means he would've overlapped
with Svenson for two years.

11:17.593 --> 11:20.638
Oh, wait. Uh, are you sure
this is my brother's file?

11:21.222 --> 11:22.973
Yes, dear, Charles Smith.

11:23.057 --> 11:24.350
That's his photo.

11:24.433 --> 11:27.978
-That is not my brother, Sister Woodhouse.
-It most certainly is.

11:28.062 --> 11:29.688
I never forget my children.

11:30.481 --> 11:34.110
Besides, you can see
the family resemblance plain as day.

12:06.100 --> 12:06.934
Who's there?

12:13.816 --> 12:16.777
Who are you?
And why the hell are you following me?

12:27.663 --> 12:29.123
Some detectives we are.

12:29.206 --> 12:32.585
Should've gone to the Sisters of Quiet
Mercy weeks ago and found this out.

12:32.668 --> 12:33.919
Found out what?

12:36.881 --> 12:40.342
-I took Chic to give his statement

12:40.426 --> 12:43.888
-and invited him for dinner.
-Great. Except he's not Chic.

12:43.971 --> 12:45.681
-Enough of the melodrama.
-He's not.

12:45.764 --> 12:47.349
-Betty.
-Shut up, imposter!

12:47.433 --> 12:50.311
Jughead and I paid a visit
to the Sisters of Quiet Mercy.

12:50.394 --> 12:53.022
That is your real son, Mom.

12:53.105 --> 12:54.940
Not this con artist.

12:56.650 --> 12:58.360
I don't-- I don't understand.

12:59.403 --> 13:00.237
I do.

13:00.946 --> 13:04.158
Betty's been out to get me.
She never wanted a brother.

13:04.241 --> 13:05.951
You're not my brother!

13:06.035 --> 13:08.579
What is this picture?
What does it all mean?

13:08.662 --> 13:10.414
That's what we're trying to figure out.

13:12.124 --> 13:13.250
The truth.

13:18.589 --> 13:20.633
Chic, no.

13:26.514 --> 13:29.767
So, I was able to recruit Cheryl myself,
it turns out.

13:30.142 --> 13:33.020
She was all too happy to be of assistance.

13:41.445 --> 13:42.404
This is Archie.

13:43.155 --> 13:45.199
Now, if you'll excuse me,
Boris and Natasha.

13:47.952 --> 13:48.786
Archie.

13:49.828 --> 13:53.249
<i>He's with me, babe.</i>

13:54.041 --> 13:57.336
You miss me?
-Nick St. Sicko.

13:58.212 --> 14:00.297
Why are you calling
from my boyfriend's phone?

14:00.381 --> 14:03.592
So that you'd believe me when I say
that I have him.

14:04.218 --> 14:06.345
It's gonna cost you to get him back.

14:07.263 --> 14:08.639
A million should do it.

14:11.058 --> 14:13.352
Whatever twisted game you're playing,

14:13.936 --> 14:17.189
don't forget what happened to your legs
the last time you misbehaved.

14:17.273 --> 14:18.148
Oh, I haven't.

14:19.024 --> 14:21.902
I'm gonna have a limp
for the rest of my life to remind me.

14:22.486 --> 14:25.698
So, it's simple.
Either you get me what I've asked for,

14:25.781 --> 14:27.992
or I start taking my anger out
on your boyfriend.

14:29.451 --> 14:31.036
<i>Believe me when I say...</i>

14:31.954 --> 14:33.914
I'm extremely angry, babe.

14:39.086 --> 14:41.005
You won't pay Archie's ransom?

14:41.088 --> 14:45.134
I am not cowing down
to a teen terrorist like Nick St. Clair.

14:45.217 --> 14:47.970
-Then I'm calling the police.
-No. You can't.

14:48.053 --> 14:51.265
The St. Clairs are a family.

14:52.641 --> 14:54.351
With ties to the underworld.

14:54.435 --> 14:57.813
-I thought they were music producers.
-They are. But they're also mobsters.

14:57.897 --> 15:01.525
And if we involve the police,
we risk exposing ourselves.

15:01.609 --> 15:03.527
Which is probably why Nick was so brazen

15:03.611 --> 15:06.238
in calling you and not even trying
to hide his identity.

15:06.322 --> 15:09.116
But we will figure this out.
I just need you to be patient.

15:09.199 --> 15:10.075
Patient?

15:10.576 --> 15:14.204
For all we know, Daddy,
Nick's cutting off Archie's ear right now.

15:18.834 --> 15:19.668
Hiram.

15:23.005 --> 15:24.256
Archie's not blood.

15:25.341 --> 15:26.550
He's not my son.

15:28.552 --> 15:30.471
If we pay, it sets a precedent.

15:30.888 --> 15:32.431
It shows that we are vulnerable.

15:32.765 --> 15:35.059
And you know who our enemies
will come after next.

15:38.437 --> 15:39.313
Veronica.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.901
Cheryl, what the hell are you doing?

15:43.984 --> 15:46.654
Kevin. No doubt you read my piece
in <i>The Register</i>.

15:46.737 --> 15:50.324
I did. And I demand a retraction.
You're smearing my father.

15:50.407 --> 15:52.284
Let's unpack that.

15:52.368 --> 15:55.162
Your father's been incompetent
since the beginning of time.

15:55.621 --> 15:59.375
And, now that more bodies are dropping,
he needs to step down.

16:00.334 --> 16:02.086
Lady Justice will be served.

16:03.212 --> 16:04.672
My Vixens and I will see to it.

16:16.517 --> 16:17.351
Wha

16:17.935 --> 16:19.186
What's going on?

16:20.020 --> 16:21.480
Why are you
-Stop.

16:22.439 --> 16:23.649
No more playacting.

16:25.275 --> 16:26.819
It's just time for answers now.

16:28.195 --> 16:31.532
-Start by telling us your real name.
-I am Chic.

16:32.116 --> 16:36.036
-Mom, untie me, please, I'm scared.
You must have known him.

16:37.788 --> 16:38.664
My brother.

16:39.248 --> 16:41.875
When my mom and I went to the hostel
and asked for Charles,

16:41.959 --> 16:43.210
they sent us to your room.

16:43.293 --> 16:44.753
Why were you impersonating him?

16:44.837 --> 16:47.548
I never said I was Charles Smith.
I said I was Chic.

16:49.967 --> 16:52.386
Then where's Charles?
How did you know him?

16:52.469 --> 16:55.389
We met on the streets,
then moved into that flophouse.

16:55.472 --> 16:58.434
He told me about you guys. The Coopers.

16:58.517 --> 17:02.938
This perfect family in Riverdale
who gave him up for adoption.

17:03.355 --> 17:06.650
Who didn't want him.
Never even looked for him.

17:07.109 --> 17:10.279
One day, he knocked,
and you answered, Alice.

17:10.362 --> 17:12.448
You practically slammed
the door in his face.

17:12.531 --> 17:14.575
You said, "We're not interested."

17:15.117 --> 17:16.493
You remember it, don't you?

17:17.703 --> 17:19.663
Charles went on a bender that night.

17:21.915 --> 17:23.417
He OD'd on Jingle-Jangle.

17:27.546 --> 17:28.630
Will you watch him?

17:32.551 --> 17:33.385
Mom?

17:35.262 --> 17:38.807
He's telling the truth. There was a boy
and I turned him away.

17:40.225 --> 17:42.019
This-- This boy--

17:45.105 --> 17:48.108
He-- He knocked on the door
and I asked him to leave.

17:48.817 --> 17:52.613
It was me, Betty.
I'm responsible for my own son's death.

17:53.072 --> 17:54.656
-No.
-I killed my son.

17:54.740 --> 17:58.368
Mom, we don't know who that is
in the basement or what he wants.

17:58.952 --> 17:59.870
Revenge.

17:59.953 --> 18:02.581
He's seeking revenge. I gave my son away. And then he came to me
and I turned him away.

18:05.959 --> 18:08.504
-This demands biblical punishment.
-Mom.

18:09.129 --> 18:12.466
The only one who's guilty here is him.

18:15.844 --> 18:16.929
Stay here, Betty.

18:18.972 --> 18:20.099
You watch him.

18:20.808 --> 18:21.809
I'll be back.

18:22.351 --> 18:23.268
Back?

18:25.229 --> 18:26.772
Mom, where are you going?

18:28.816 --> 18:30.234
What if Dad comes home?

18:30.984 --> 18:33.487
Nick, you don't understand.
You have to let me go.

18:35.114 --> 18:38.909
There's a killer on the loose.
The Black Hood. You heard about him.

18:39.159 --> 18:41.078
-I thought he was dead.
-He may not be.

18:42.830 --> 18:45.040
And, Nick, my dad...

18:47.084 --> 18:48.210
he may be in danger.

18:50.003 --> 18:51.130
Sucks to be your dad.

18:51.713 --> 18:52.589
You bastard.

18:52.965 --> 18:55.217
You're seriously doing this
because I punched you?

18:55.300 --> 18:57.719
You. Veronica.

18:58.303 --> 18:59.513
The Pussycats.

19:00.180 --> 19:02.808
My father is this close to disowning me!

19:04.309 --> 19:05.853
He says I'm an embarrassment.

19:05.936 --> 19:09.022
That I'll never have the guts
to be in the family business.

19:10.357 --> 19:11.441
Well...

19:12.734 --> 19:14.486
you're gonna help me prove him wrong.

19:15.779 --> 19:18.115
I'm gonna make my bones with you, Andrews.

19:50.230 --> 19:51.690
Always my birthday.

20:01.074 --> 20:02.117
Not enough.

20:04.620 --> 20:07.289
Let's skip the pleasantries.
I have your money, Nick.

20:07.372 --> 20:08.707
<i>Well done, Ronnie.</i>

20:09.291 --> 20:12.252
<i>Meet me at that delightful</i>
<i>Chock'lit Shoppe of yours.</i>

20:12.336 --> 20:14.713
<i>In, say, an hour?</i>

20:14.796 --> 20:17.633
<i>And come alone.</i>
<i>Or Red loses even more blood.</i>

20:30.479 --> 20:32.940
Dad, that article Cheryl wrote...

20:33.440 --> 20:35.359
-you can't take that to heart.

20:36.610 --> 20:38.403
I shot Svenson on the bridge.

20:38.487 --> 20:41.490
I wanted this done with the Black Hood.

20:41.573 --> 20:45.285
So, maybe-- Maybe I, uh,
cut a few corners.

20:46.286 --> 20:49.414
Maybe I didn't have enough evidence
to close this case.

21:19.569 --> 21:20.404
Veronica.

21:22.781 --> 21:23.782
You look lovely.

21:26.535 --> 21:30.247
Before we do anything,
I need proof that Archie's okay.

21:36.962 --> 21:38.380
Archie. Oh, my God.

21:38.922 --> 21:41.049
Where is he, you barbarian?

21:41.133 --> 21:43.051
First, the money.

21:50.767 --> 21:52.728
There's no way this is all of it.

21:53.228 --> 21:56.315
-Let Archie go and I'll get you the rest.

21:56.982 --> 22:00.694
How are you going to come up with that
if not from your parents?

22:05.198 --> 22:06.241
Unless...

22:07.451 --> 22:08.827
you give me something else. Dare I ask what?

22:11.663 --> 22:12.622
How about...

22:14.458 --> 22:15.959
what we started in New York?

22:16.376 --> 22:20.047
What we should have finished back
at the Five Seasons. What I'm owed.

22:20.756 --> 22:22.215
A night together.

22:22.799 --> 22:25.218
-I'll book my usual suite--
-My God, Nick.

22:26.094 --> 22:27.262
You're a reptile.

22:29.556 --> 22:30.390
Even if I...

22:31.892 --> 22:33.185
did agree...

22:35.479 --> 22:37.647
what guarantee do I have
you'll let Archie go?

22:37.731 --> 22:39.733
Why, my word as a gentleman.

22:45.864 --> 22:46.990
Alice?

22:47.574 --> 22:48.658
What's wrong?

22:51.912 --> 22:54.664
No more secrets. No more lies.

22:55.248 --> 22:59.503
I should have told you sooner.
Maybe something would have been different.

23:02.839 --> 23:05.759
I had your ba-- I had your baby.

23:07.219 --> 23:10.347
His name-- I named him Charles.

23:10.931 --> 23:13.600
I-- I-- I had to give him up for adoption.

23:13.683 --> 23:16.269
Alice. Slow down. Slow down, all right? He came to see me and I turned him away.

23:20.565 --> 23:21.691
And now he's dead.

23:22.317 --> 23:26.488
He's dead because of me. I killed our son.

23:26.822 --> 23:29.074
Do Do you remember, FP?

23:29.157 --> 23:31.660
-Yeah, I remember Alice--

23:31.743 --> 23:32.702
I'm sorry.

23:34.079 --> 23:35.455
I-- I made a mistake.

23:37.457 --> 23:38.458
I'm sorry.

23:38.542 --> 23:40.377
-Wait, Alice.
-No, I have to go.

23:40.460 --> 23:43.171
-Betty and Jughead are waiting.

23:43.255 --> 23:45.757
No, Chic-- Chic is someone else. Chic is--

23:46.424 --> 23:49.469
You don't understand what I've done, FP.

23:49.553 --> 23:53.140
You don't understand what I'm respon--
Responsible for.

23:53.723 --> 23:54.641
It's okay.

23:56.977 --> 23:58.645
It's okay. It's okay.

24:23.211 --> 24:25.672
<i>Deep down, you knew it wasn't over.</i>

24:25.755 --> 24:27.174
You killed Midge.

<i>Of course.</i>

24:29.801 --> 24:31.511
And you set up Mr. Svenson?

24:31.970 --> 24:33.763
<i>Very, very good, Betty.</i>

24:34.222 --> 24:39.060

24:57.329 --> 24:58.163
Was that your mom Uh...

25:02.334 --> 25:03.501
No, it's my dad.

25:08.715 --> 25:10.508
We need to go back there, Jug.

25:12.052 --> 25:13.345
To where I first found Chic.

25:14.971 --> 25:17.933
I don't think he's telling the truth
about my brother.

25:18.016 --> 25:21.186
You like dirty movies, Archie?

25:22.103 --> 25:23.772
When I turn this laptop on,

25:24.231 --> 25:27.901
it's going to have a live feed
of my suite at the Five Seasons,

25:28.318 --> 25:33.365
where Veronica and I will be having
a little date.

25:33.448 --> 25:34.491
You're lying.

25:35.367 --> 25:36.701
Veronica would never--

25:40.622 --> 25:42.290
She would and she is.

25:42.874 --> 25:46.336
-Because I said I'd let you go afterwards.
-I'll kill you.

25:47.504 --> 25:48.380
You know...

25:50.382 --> 25:51.841
I think you just might.

25:52.842 --> 25:55.053
That's why this can only end one way.

25:58.014 --> 26:02.102
When I said that I was gonna make
my bones, I meant it.

26:03.103 --> 26:05.855
But you have to kill someone for that.

26:08.233 --> 26:11.945
And who better
than Hiram Lodge's teen capo?

26:16.658 --> 26:19.077
Forty dollars a night for a single bed,
20 for a bunk.

26:19.703 --> 26:22.038
A single. On the second floor.

26:40.724 --> 26:41.725
Try this.

26:44.728 --> 26:47.022
Not now. Go away!

26:47.105 --> 26:48.231
Okay.

26:55.780 --> 26:57.991
We won't take up much of your time.

26:58.074 --> 27:03.163
My brother, Charles Smith, I think
he used to live next to you in Room 237.

27:03.747 --> 27:05.749
Does he look familiar to you? -Oh, yes. He was the nice one.

27:08.418 --> 27:11.880
Always said <i>buenos días.</i>
Always carried my groceries.

27:12.464 --> 27:14.007
May he rest in peace.

27:14.090 --> 27:15.550
-Oh, my God.
Hold on.

27:15.633 --> 27:17.969
Did he have a drug problem
with Jingle

27:18.553 --> 27:21.890
I don't know about any drugs,
but they fought, those two.

27:22.349 --> 27:24.225
Nasty fights. It was scary.

27:25.185 --> 27:28.563
And then, one day, there was only one.
The bad one.

27:29.230 --> 27:34.277
Later, when I took my trash out, I saw
bloody sheets and pillows in the dumpster.

27:39.199 --> 27:42.494
We know you murdered my brother.

27:42.577 --> 27:46.748
Your neighbor heard you fighting.
She saw blood. Lots of it.

27:46.831 --> 27:48.500
Admit what you did, Chic.

27:48.958 --> 27:51.711
I admit your brother was a junkie.

27:56.049 --> 27:58.718
Go ahead. Hit me all you want.

28:00.178 --> 28:02.138
You won't kill me because you're scared.

28:03.056 --> 28:07.435
You won't let me go. You're worried
that I'll rat about the shady guy.

28:09.896 --> 28:11.481
Tell us the truth...

28:12.607 --> 28:13.691
about my brother.

28:17.404 --> 28:19.197
I already did, Betty.

28:20.865 --> 28:21.866
Or maybe I didn't.

29:45.450 --> 29:47.744
-Getting him to talk.
-The hell you are!

29:47.827 --> 29:49.412
The hell you are.

30:01.883 --> 30:03.593
That's not your business.

30:04.093 --> 30:07.931
We're gonna leave Betty and Alice alone

I can't.

30:14.062 --> 30:16.481
I won't. I won't have you near that, Jug.

It's not our house, Jug.

30:24.531 --> 30:26.157
It's not our place.

30:26.241 --> 30:30.870
They need to decide what they wanna do.
How to end this. And then we will help.

30:32.288 --> 30:34.123
We could drive him out of town.

30:34.624 --> 30:35.917
No, he'll come back.

30:36.501 --> 30:38.378
We could turn him over to someone.

30:41.422 --> 30:44.801
No, we gotta tell your father.

-What are you doing in this hick town

30:59.274 --> 31:01.734
when all of Manhattan
should be kissing your feet?

31:02.277 --> 31:03.736
I like it here.

31:03.820 --> 31:05.864
This is a phase.

31:07.240 --> 31:08.908
Same with that hayseed, Archie.

31:10.034 --> 31:11.744
If only he could see us now.

31:12.328 --> 31:15.456
<i>No need to gloat, Nicholas.</i>
<i>You got what you wanted.</i>

31:16.082 --> 31:18.793
<i>Why don't you sit down</i>
<i>and make yourself comfy?</i>

31:18.877 --> 31:20.336

31:26.968 --> 31:29.220
We could've been something, you and I.

31:36.853 --> 31:41.232
This dalliance with you and Archie...
it's beneath you.

31:43.234 --> 31:45.278
Can you stop talking about Archie?

31:46.154 --> 31:47.530
Couldn't agree more.

32:48.591 --> 32:49.550
God.

32:49.634 --> 32:52.178
We used to joke
about ending up together.

32:52.261 --> 32:55.974
-You started roofie-ing girls, Nick.

32:57.183 --> 32:59.143
Including my friend, Cheryl.

33:00.687 --> 33:03.356
Schoolboy mischief. All in the past.

33:05.233 --> 33:06.985
Now, answer me this.

33:11.823 --> 33:13.032
Still like to dance?

33:29.048 --> 33:31.384
Same perfume as from back in the day.

33:31.926 --> 33:34.554
-Diabolique.

33:37.140 --> 33:38.516
I wore it just for you.

33:41.936 --> 33:45.148
There is a sicko tied up
in our basement.

33:48.526 --> 33:52.030
-It is time we let the law deal with him.
-It's not that simple.

33:52.113 --> 33:54.574
Why does that parasite deserve
our protection?

33:54.657 --> 33:56.868
Because I'll go to prison, too.

33:56.951 --> 34:00.788
Okay, Chic killed a man here
and I helped him cover it up.

34:01.664 --> 34:04.125
-We disposed of the body.
!

34:05.418 --> 34:07.712
-Betty had nothing to do with it.

34:08.171 --> 34:09.922
It was Chic and me.
-Mom.

34:10.006 --> 34:12.759
No. Do not say another word.
Go to your room.

34:13.426 --> 34:15.470
Alice, why would you do that?

34:16.387 --> 34:19.140
My primary concern was
to protect my family.

34:19.223 --> 34:23.061
And I thought he was a part of it,
but he's not.

34:32.570 --> 34:33.905
Where'd you get that?

34:35.364 --> 34:36.199
I took it.

34:38.117 --> 34:40.578
From a music teacher who was like you.

34:41.162 --> 34:41.996
A predator.

34:49.545 --> 34:50.671
It's a cold night.

34:51.214 --> 34:52.924
I'm going to cut you loose.

34:53.633 --> 34:55.426
And then we are going to leave.

34:58.346 --> 34:59.931
Out the basement door.

35:14.821 --> 35:16.197
-Ronnie.
-Archie.

35:16.948 --> 35:18.449
Oh, my God. Your face.

35:20.284 --> 35:23.079
Did he hurt you?
-No, not a bit.

35:23.162 --> 35:25.414
I gave Nick taste of his own medicine.

35:26.958 --> 35:27.792
I roofied him.

35:28.584 --> 35:30.711
Smuggled in via your Christmas gift.

35:35.216 --> 35:37.260
What are we gonna do with him now?

35:37.969 --> 35:40.221
Concierge is sending up a power drill.

35:41.931 --> 35:44.308
I'm kidding. But I do have an idea.

35:44.851 --> 35:48.437
Mr. St. Clair,
I have your son Nick here with me.

35:48.980 --> 35:52.567
I'm wondering how much it's worth to you
getting him back in one piece.

35:59.115 --> 36:00.491
Who was that, Betty?

36:01.200 --> 36:02.910
Who was that who called you?

36:03.369 --> 36:04.954
With that weird ringtone?

36:06.581 --> 36:07.915
You'll find out.

36:08.416 --> 36:09.959
Now that it's just us...

36:11.377 --> 36:12.378
Did you do it?

36:14.380 --> 36:15.798
Did you kill my brother?

36:20.595 --> 36:21.762
We got in a fight.

36:23.431 --> 36:24.515
I lost control.

36:27.602 --> 36:29.145
I didn't mean to hurt him.

36:48.289 --> 36:49.123
Who's that?

36:51.500 --> 36:53.836
That's your very own angel of death.

36:55.129 --> 36:56.172
The Black Hood.

36:59.091 --> 37:00.885
He's the one who called me.

37:03.221 --> 37:05.473
If that were true,
you'd be running for your life.

37:05.556 --> 37:06.390
No.

37:07.934 --> 37:09.644
He's not interested in me.

37:14.065 --> 37:15.733
I'm gonna give you a head start.

37:17.193 --> 37:21.781
I'd say you have about a 70 percent chance
of making it before he cuts you down.

37:22.698 --> 37:24.200
You should start running.

37:26.452 --> 37:30.706
Sixty percent. The longer you stall,
the more your chances keep dropping.

37:30.790 --> 37:32.291
What are you waiting for?

37:33.876 --> 37:34.919
Fifty.

37:57.733 --> 37:58.609
Goodbye, Chic.

38:08.703 --> 38:09.537
Dad?

38:17.086 --> 38:20.589
Deputy Mayor has demanded
that I step down as sheriff.

38:22.550 --> 38:23.759
Turn in my badge.

38:24.343 --> 38:29.098
And if Fred Andrews gets elected mayor,
then I live to fight another day.

38:29.181 --> 38:33.394
And if Hermione Lodge wins,
well, then, I'm out on my ass.

38:33.978 --> 38:38.649
I'll campaign for Mr. Andrews 24/7.
You can't desert your post in a crisis.

38:39.275 --> 38:40.109
Kevin.

38:41.152 --> 38:45.197
If I resign, they'll likely bring in
somebody from outside.

38:46.449 --> 38:49.076
Someone who could catch the Black Hood.

38:53.497 --> 38:54.373
Oh. Hello, Daddy.

38:56.667 --> 38:58.711
-Hi, Mom.

38:59.503 --> 39:00.588
It's ransom money.

39:01.797 --> 39:03.632
Not for Archie. I got him back.

39:04.300 --> 39:08.137
No, this is from when I turned the tables
on Nick and held him for ransom.

39:09.847 --> 39:12.516
His parents gave me a million
for my trouble.

39:12.600 --> 39:16.145
-I told you I was handling the St. Clairs.
-Funny enough...

39:17.021 --> 39:19.648
they hadn't heard boo
about Archie's kidnapping.

39:20.191 --> 39:23.027
But I'll leave that to you
to explain to Archie.

39:23.819 --> 39:25.363
He's in the study waiting.

39:30.368 --> 39:33.496
-Archie, I'd like to explain myself.
-There's no need.

39:34.747 --> 39:37.708
I thought about a lot
while Nick was wailing on me.

39:38.167 --> 39:41.837
One of them was how I feel
as if I've proved myself to you.

39:44.006 --> 39:45.674
But there's one step left.

39:47.760 --> 39:49.720
I haven't made my bones with you.

39:57.144 --> 39:58.687
What do you have in mind?

39:59.271 --> 40:02.358
There's only one man I'm interested
in bringing down.

40:05.861 --> 40:06.779
The Black Hood.

40:08.364 --> 40:09.657
Once and for all.

40:11.409 --> 40:13.119
Would that earn me my bones?

40:14.537 --> 40:15.579
I should say so.

40:16.163 --> 40:18.332
And whatever I can do to help you...

40:19.542 --> 40:20.751
you can count on me.

40:25.005 --> 40:29.385
<i>Some prisoners aren't bound</i>
<i>by chains or locked in cells.</i>

40:29.927 --> 40:33.431
<i>Archie's prison was built</i>
<i>with his own ambition and rage.</i>

40:34.181 --> 40:37.059
<i>And he'd just handed Hiram Lodge the keys.</i>

40:38.394 --> 40:40.563
<i>While, across town,</i>

40:40.646 --> 40:43.524
<i>the past was proving to be a cruel jailor.</i>

40:48.904 --> 40:50.489
Where'd you go, Betty?

40:52.491 --> 40:53.784
I took Chic away.

40:54.785 --> 40:55.703
He's gone.

40:58.414 --> 40:59.915
For good, I think.

41:18.309 --> 41:19.435
Where is he, Betty?

41:20.478 --> 41:21.937
Where did you take Chic?

41:24.732 --> 41:26.525
I took him to the bus station.

41:31.572 --> 41:32.448
And then...

41:33.365 --> 41:34.825
And then what?

41:40.164 --> 41:41.040
Mom.

41:42.750 --> 41:43.667
Where's Dad?

41:46.837 --> 41:48.881
He went looking for you.
