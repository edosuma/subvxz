00:37.732 --> 00:39.635
<i>Four days ago,</i>

00:39.735 --> 00:43.022
<i>on the outside, my life seemed perfect.</i>

00:43.372 --> 00:47.054
<i>Perfect boyfriend, perfect job,</i>

00:47.276 --> 00:49.841
<i>perfect peace.</i>

00:50.979 --> 00:53.854
<i>But something was always missing.</i>

00:56.082 --> 00:58.780
<i>That's why I needed to find you.</i>

00:59.352 --> 01:01.526
<i>To find me.</i>

01:51.793 --> 01:53.562
"Ahimsa,"

01:53.662 --> 01:59.217
which means non-violence,
is the foundation of our practice.

02:02.268 --> 02:05.538
We have the ability, every day,

02:05.638 --> 02:08.140
to choose peace.

02:12.977 --> 02:15.614
Within every posture,

02:15.714 --> 02:18.083
every breath,

02:18.550 --> 02:21.263
and every moment of our lives.

02:57.600 --> 03:02.639
That is a nice car.
What is that? '65? '66?

03:03.489 --> 03:05.257
'65.

03:05.357 --> 03:08.471
They don't make 'em like that anymore.

04:19.673 --> 04:24.996
I know it's expensive, but I really think
it's worth advertising in the yoga journal.

04:25.096 --> 04:26.027
Okay.

04:26.127 --> 04:28.382
We could mention that we're donating
to that orphanage.

04:28.482 --> 04:29.684
Yeah.

04:30.684 --> 04:33.119
Do you have any pictures
of you with the kids there?

04:33.603 --> 04:35.771
- Yeah, I think I do.
- That's great.

04:35.871 --> 04:39.324
- And I'm still waiting on your bio.
- I know, I'm working on it.

04:39.774 --> 04:42.677
Just keep it simple.
You're an inspiring woman.

04:42.777 --> 04:46.219
- I guess.
- You inspire me.

04:49.247 --> 04:52.351
Hey, honey, did you take
your old car out today?

04:52.451 --> 04:54.276
Yeah, why?

04:54.376 --> 04:57.191
Well, you said
you were gonna take your bike.

04:57.489 --> 05:00.325
I just... just ran a couple of errands.

05:00.425 --> 05:03.899
Yeah, I wish you would've told me,
I would've come back early.

05:06.695 --> 05:09.746
You know, I heard from Kathy today. The...

05:09.846 --> 05:12.472
You know the private investigator?

05:12.899 --> 05:14.568
And?

05:14.668 --> 05:16.179
And...

05:16.279 --> 05:19.705
she has an address for Susan,

05:19.805 --> 05:22.357
and it's 30 minutes away.

05:23.868 --> 05:25.182
Yeah.

05:25.310 --> 05:27.945
I think I really want to meet her.

05:28.045 --> 05:31.952
I think that's great.
I think that's gonna be...

05:32.192 --> 05:34.150
really good for you.

05:34.851 --> 05:38.006
Yeah, I think I'm gonna take a few hours
tomorrow, and just drive down there...

05:38.106 --> 05:39.988
Tomorrow?

05:40.088 --> 05:41.923
Yeah.

05:42.023 --> 05:45.188
Well, we just... we've got so much to do.

05:45.288 --> 05:48.098
This is gonna be very emotional for you.

05:48.462 --> 05:50.322
Yeah.

05:50.422 --> 05:52.926
Yeah, you're probably right.

05:53.026 --> 05:55.707
I should just do it some other time.

06:32.103 --> 06:33.556
Yeah?

06:34.806 --> 06:36.632
Hi.

06:37.940 --> 06:40.224
Are you Susan Adams?

06:40.324 --> 06:41.611
Yeah.

06:41.711 --> 06:44.547
I'm May Miller.

06:45.014 --> 06:47.288
So, what do you want?

06:48.782 --> 06:51.652
This is gonna sound strange,

06:51.752 --> 06:54.527
but I think you're my sister...

06:54.921 --> 06:57.523
my biological mother,

06:57.623 --> 07:00.344
her name was Jennifer Adams.

07:00.444 --> 07:01.869
- Are you...
- Who is it?

07:01.969 --> 07:04.307
Nobody, baby.

07:05.831 --> 07:10.903
Yeah, there's a bar around the corner,
I'll meet you there in five minutes.

07:46.701 --> 07:48.817
Want a drink?

07:49.271 --> 07:51.405
Yeah, I'll get it.

07:51.505 --> 07:53.815
What would you like?

07:55.875 --> 07:57.611
I'll have a vodka cranberry.

07:57.711 --> 08:01.307
It doesn't need to be fancy vodka,
house is fine.

08:05.683 --> 08:07.524
Okay.

08:11.454 --> 08:14.139
I... I brought you these.

08:14.239 --> 08:17.226
They're these amazing raw cookies,

08:17.326 --> 08:21.330
with... macadamia and chia seeds.

08:21.430 --> 08:23.538
Thanks.

08:25.533 --> 08:28.210
You might want to take a look at that.

08:31.304 --> 08:33.611
I'll get our drinks.

09:08.139 --> 09:11.009
You are Susan, right?

09:11.109 --> 09:13.951
Yeah, but call me Shiva, even Mom did.

09:17.580 --> 09:19.358
Okay.

09:26.487 --> 09:28.895
- So...
- So, what...

09:30.557 --> 09:34.434
- Sorry, you go first.
- No, you go.

09:35.361 --> 09:38.402
This is fuckin' crazy.

09:38.965 --> 09:40.826
Yeah.

09:45.533 --> 09:49.309
I guess she never told you about me.

09:49.409 --> 09:51.730
No, never.

09:53.542 --> 09:55.450
Thanks.

09:57.779 --> 09:59.481
- Sorry.
- Thanks.

09:59.581 --> 10:01.489
Yep.

10:08.921 --> 10:11.624
You look just like her.

10:11.724 --> 10:14.398
It's something about your...

10:18.462 --> 10:23.006
Well, I wouldn't know 'cause I've...
I've never seen her.

10:29.072 --> 10:30.947
Here.

10:46.788 --> 10:50.041
- How old were you when she died?
- 12.

10:51.368 --> 10:53.617
- God, that must have been hard.
- Yeah.

10:53.717 --> 10:57.438
- Did you live with your dad after that?
- Foster homes.

10:57.930 --> 11:00.132
Didn't you have any other family?

11:00.232 --> 11:03.448
Yeah, my mom's parents,
but they didn't want me.

11:11.975 --> 11:14.178
What year were you born?

11:14.278 --> 11:16.264
'81.

11:17.447 --> 11:20.788
Fuck, she was like 17 when she had you.

11:24.585 --> 11:26.588
Do you think it's...

11:27.188 --> 11:30.157
Do you think it's possible
that we have the same dad?

11:30.257 --> 11:33.192
I doubt it.
I mean, I never met my dad, so...

11:33.292 --> 11:37.802
But, I don't know, like ten years apart?
It doesn't seem likely.

11:44.567 --> 11:46.505
- So, what do you do?
- What do you mean?

11:46.605 --> 11:48.829
You know, for a living.

11:50.621 --> 11:52.591
I try to make people happy.

11:53.341 --> 11:55.576
I guess I kind of do that too.

11:55.676 --> 11:58.373
- How?
- I teach yoga.

11:59.846 --> 12:01.848
What about you?

12:03.148 --> 12:04.872
Massage.

12:08.119 --> 12:10.392
Here, give me your hand.

12:19.294 --> 12:21.637
Oh, look at that.

12:23.731 --> 12:26.730
- What?
- Your lifeline.

12:26.830 --> 12:30.405
Like totally stops
and then it starts again.

12:30.705 --> 12:33.481
It's like you have two lives.

12:40.479 --> 12:43.249
Okay, you hurt yourself doing yoga.

12:43.349 --> 12:45.488
Isn't it supposed to be,
like, healing and shit?

12:45.588 --> 12:48.285
Well, yeah, I mean,
that's absolutely the intention,

12:48.385 --> 12:52.127
but you know,
you can't control the outcome.

12:54.739 --> 12:58.059
Sometimes, you...
you need an injury to grow.

12:58.159 --> 13:01.228
You need it to, you know, evolve.

13:01.328 --> 13:03.669
That's fucked up.

13:09.734 --> 13:13.338
- Well, this is me.
- What?

13:14.038 --> 13:16.941
Holy shit, this is your ride?

13:17.341 --> 13:21.211
- Yeah, you like it?
- Holy shit, yeah.

13:21.311 --> 13:25.915
My boyfriend wants me to sell it
for a smart car, or something.

13:26.015 --> 13:27.449
Oh, my God, fuck that.

13:27.549 --> 13:30.752
Over my dead body you can
sell this for a fucking smart car.

13:30.852 --> 13:33.721
Oh, my God,
I would kill for a car like this.

13:33.821 --> 13:35.089
Well, you want to buy it?

13:35.189 --> 13:38.758
Oh, yeah, just let me get the bag of cash
that's waiting in my living room.

13:38.858 --> 13:41.520
Oh, now, I'll give you
the family discount.

13:47.344 --> 13:51.211
Here... take it, I got... I got others.

13:52.501 --> 13:54.276
Thanks.

13:58.642 --> 14:00.680
I gotta go.

14:01.108 --> 14:05.418
Okay, so, can...
can we see each other again?

14:06.045 --> 14:10.722
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I'll call "Yoga with May."

14:11.416 --> 14:15.054
Yeah, we will... we'll do some yoga.

14:15.154 --> 14:18.061
Yeah, so my knee can get
fucked up, too. Bye.

14:18.161 --> 14:19.963
Bye.

14:36.105 --> 14:40.010
- Hey.
- Hey. Where you been?

14:40.110 --> 14:43.868
- Oh, you picked up the postcards.
- Yeah, they look great.

14:44.779 --> 14:47.654
Yeah, I've been trying
to call you all morning.

14:49.949 --> 14:52.018
So, where were you?

14:54.687 --> 14:57.598
I was just... out.

14:58.923 --> 15:00.931
Who is it?

15:03.743 --> 15:05.862
- I met her.
- Who?

15:10.299 --> 15:12.507
I met Susan.

15:13.334 --> 15:16.544
So... how was it?

15:18.105 --> 15:20.374
It was great.

15:20.775 --> 15:22.443
It was really great.

15:22.543 --> 15:26.146
I mean, she's so different from me.
She's so different.

15:26.246 --> 15:29.097
But there was just this...

15:30.578 --> 15:34.053
I don't know, this deep connection
that I didn't expect.

15:34.153 --> 15:36.519
That's beautiful.

15:38.855 --> 15:41.091
I'd love to meet her.

15:41.191 --> 15:44.051
Her boyfriend wants to meet me, too,
and they are going out tonight,

15:44.151 --> 15:47.629
- and they invited us to come.
- Well, not tonight.

15:47.729 --> 15:50.237
We have plans, remember?

17:21.685 --> 17:24.887
- All the bullshit I do for you?
- Like what?

17:25.085 --> 17:27.606
- Hi.
- Hey.

17:27.705 --> 17:30.125
So... so this is May, right?

17:30.225 --> 17:33.527
- Oh, this is my boyfriend, Cody.
- Well, it's nice to meet you.

17:33.627 --> 17:38.737
Yeah, likewise. You know I can...
I can see the family resemblance.

17:40.065 --> 17:43.007
Must be like looking
in a mirror with you two.

17:43.735 --> 17:46.818
Hey, wait... let me buy you a drink.
What do you want?

17:46.918 --> 17:49.381
Oh, well, I'm driving tonight,
so just a water.

17:49.531 --> 17:51.975
Bullshit, come on,
you can have one drink, right?

17:52.075 --> 17:55.144
No, I've got a really early start
in the morning, so...

17:55.244 --> 17:56.978
A glass of wine, maybe?

17:57.078 --> 18:00.580
You look like the Chardonnay type.
You are the Chardonnay type.

18:00.980 --> 18:03.414
- Well, sometimes, but not tonight.
- No?

18:03.514 --> 18:07.019
- Thank you.
- Baby, can you just get her a water, please?

18:07.119 --> 18:12.123
Okay. All right, so one water,
one vodka and cranberry for the princess.

18:12.223 --> 18:14.597
I'll see you inside.

18:15.708 --> 18:18.044
- Hey, can we go?
- Is everything okay?

18:18.144 --> 18:20.429
- I can't deal with him tonight, let's go.
- Sure.

18:20.529 --> 18:22.169
Okay.

18:23.664 --> 18:26.596
- Do you want to tell him?
- Do you want a lime in it? Hey!

18:26.696 --> 18:30.423
- Just trust me.
- Hey! Where the fuck are you going?

18:30.523 --> 18:31.904
I'm buying you a fucking drink.

18:32.004 --> 18:34.039
- Fuck off.
- What the fuck is that bullshit?

18:34.179 --> 18:36.641
- Come on, I'm buying you fucking drinks.
- Get off!

18:36.741 --> 18:38.776
- Hey, hey, hey...
- Don't fucking hit me.

18:38.876 --> 18:40.917
Leave her alone, man.

18:42.611 --> 18:46.108
- I'm sorry, who the fuck are you?
- Hey, be cool, man.

18:46.208 --> 18:49.650
- If the lady wants to leave, just...
- I said, who the fuck are you?

18:49.750 --> 18:52.654
Who the fuck are you? You don't have
any problems? I've got problems.

18:52.754 --> 18:54.956
Can you get me out of here? Please?

18:55.056 --> 18:57.458
- ...'cause I've got a big fucking problem.
- Leave us alone!

18:57.558 --> 18:59.593
That's cute, fuck.

18:59.693 --> 19:00.627
Fucking weakling.

19:00.727 --> 19:03.729
- We have to call the police.
- Please, May, let's just go.

19:04.129 --> 19:05.630
Stop it!

19:07.432 --> 19:09.672
What the fuck you gonna do?

19:11.302 --> 19:14.210
- Jesus.
- Shiva, where are you going?

19:34.123 --> 19:38.040
I think it's fate that we met
right now, don't you?

19:42.597 --> 19:46.335
I also think that you are a powerful,
beautiful woman

19:46.435 --> 19:49.410
who doesn't even realize it.

19:55.342 --> 19:57.217
Thanks.

20:00.780 --> 20:03.623
- Good-night.
- Good-night.

20:28.088 --> 20:30.338
What are you doing?

20:32.443 --> 20:34.818
I'm just saying a prayer for peace.

20:37.445 --> 20:39.953
You're such a hippie.

20:53.025 --> 20:54.766
Sorry.

20:57.762 --> 21:00.700
No, it's... it's okay.

21:00.800 --> 21:02.763
It's nice.

21:25.653 --> 21:27.461
May.

21:31.124 --> 21:32.932
May.

21:34.593 --> 21:36.436
Hey.

21:39.730 --> 21:44.540
I did not feel comfortable
letting her go back to her own place.

21:45.501 --> 21:48.582
- Okay. I've gotta go, I've got a private.
- Okay.

21:48.682 --> 21:52.379
You've got class in less than an hour.
So you should start moving.

21:53.506 --> 21:55.775
You know, I think I'm gonna cancel today.

21:55.875 --> 21:58.244
Cancel? What?

21:58.744 --> 22:01.651
Look, I'm happy
that you found your sister, but...

22:01.845 --> 22:03.647
- Hi.
- Hi, I'm sorry,

22:03.747 --> 22:06.516
I just needed to use the bathroom.

22:06.616 --> 22:09.218
Oh, yeah, it's just... there, on the left.

22:09.318 --> 22:11.186
And this is my boyfriend.

22:11.286 --> 22:15.388
- Hi, Shiva. Dex. Very nice to meet you.
- Yeah, you too.

22:19.458 --> 22:21.233
She seems sweet.

22:22.427 --> 22:25.333
Okay. We can talk about this later.

22:25.433 --> 22:27.705
- Okay.
- Alright.

22:27.809 --> 22:30.301
- Bye. Love you.
- Love you.

22:30.401 --> 22:32.274
Bye, Shiva.

22:40.408 --> 22:42.277
Hey.

22:42.377 --> 22:45.180
He seems, like, super nice.

22:45.580 --> 22:47.454
Yeah.

22:48.781 --> 22:53.285
You know, I was thinking... would you
want to just go away for a night?

22:53.385 --> 22:55.954
- Just you and me?
- Like a lady date?

22:56.904 --> 22:59.089
Yeah, exactly.

22:59.189 --> 23:01.024
And go where?

23:01.124 --> 23:04.477
My mom has this little place up near
Santa Barbara, we could just chill, and...

23:04.577 --> 23:07.796
she's probably gonna be there,
but there is a pool.

23:07.896 --> 23:11.233
Oh, fuck. I wish.

23:11.833 --> 23:13.197
Why not?

23:13.297 --> 23:15.990
Cody would fucking freak.

23:16.270 --> 23:19.572
Well, Dex will freak too. So?

23:19.672 --> 23:23.291
I've gotta work this weekend.
I've gotta get my rent together.

23:39.022 --> 23:40.859
Here.

23:41.559 --> 23:43.561
Pay me back whenever.

23:43.661 --> 23:45.763
Are you sure?

23:45.863 --> 23:47.637
Yeah.

23:51.634 --> 23:53.442
Thanks.

24:01.910 --> 24:05.581
His truck's gone,
so he's definitely not home.

24:06.781 --> 24:08.514
Do you want me to go in with you?

24:09.617 --> 24:11.591
Okay.

24:12.518 --> 24:16.256
Or you could just borrow something, 'cause
I have plenty of stuff there, like I said.

24:16.356 --> 24:19.520
No, I'm... I'm good.

24:19.825 --> 24:22.327
- What is that look?
- What look?

24:22.427 --> 24:25.428
- That look you just gave me.
- I didn't give you a look.

24:25.528 --> 24:27.697
Yes, you did.

24:27.797 --> 24:31.864
I to... okay, you look gorgeous
in that dress, I'm just like...

24:31.964 --> 24:34.275
I couldn't pull it off the way you do.

24:45.879 --> 24:48.287
Hey, I like your disco ball.

24:49.715 --> 24:51.718
Oh, yeah?

24:51.818 --> 24:55.894
Cool. Yeah, I got it at the flea market.

24:57.055 --> 25:00.492
Do you want something to drink?
Like some water? I think we have beer.

25:00.692 --> 25:02.362
Nope, I'm fine.

25:03.459 --> 25:05.235
Okay.

25:19.608 --> 25:22.818
- So, how long have you lived here?
- Like, three years.

25:27.814 --> 25:30.690
Is... is that a gun?

25:31.684 --> 25:33.054
Yeah.

25:34.354 --> 25:38.191
- Is it yours?
- It's Cody's.

25:38.291 --> 25:40.765
You know what guys are like.

25:41.427 --> 25:45.137
- Jesus, don't point that over here.
- Well, it won't bite unless you make it.

25:47.197 --> 25:50.200
- That is not funny.
- It's a little funny.

25:50.300 --> 25:52.135
You totally wanna hold it.

25:52.435 --> 25:55.675
Take it, come on. Take it.

25:57.070 --> 25:58.907
Come on.

26:00.807 --> 26:03.143
- It's heavy.
- Yeah, it's a .45.

26:03.243 --> 26:06.316
It's Cody's dad's gun from Vietnam.

26:08.980 --> 26:12.483
- Is it loaded?
- Always.

26:12.583 --> 26:14.090
Here.

26:16.485 --> 26:19.121
I mean, come on,
doesn't that make you a little scared?

26:19.221 --> 26:21.290
You have a loaded gun in your house.

26:21.390 --> 26:26.227
No. It makes us safe, right?
Like if the bad guys come.

26:27.127 --> 26:30.864
Yeah, but if the bad guys come,
it's more likely to be used on you.

26:31.064 --> 26:33.886
No, those bad guys never met Cody.

27:00.492 --> 27:02.995
<i>What was our mother like?</i>

27:04.195 --> 27:06.869
<i>She was just so much fun.</i>

27:10.966 --> 27:14.842
<i>Was she cool? Was she wild?</i>

27:15.703 --> 27:18.631
<i>You know, she had such a big heart.</i>

27:20.039 --> 27:22.434
<i>She was...</i>

27:22.534 --> 27:24.823
<i>I loved her.</i>

27:37.554 --> 27:40.196
<i>You would've loved each other.</i>

28:14.656 --> 28:18.199
- Fuck, nice place.
- Thanks.

28:22.563 --> 28:26.467
- Hey, can I ask you something?
- Yeah, sure.

28:26.567 --> 28:31.504
And it's... if it's none of my business,
I mean... you don't have to answer.

28:31.604 --> 28:33.478
Okay.

28:34.505 --> 28:37.545
What kind of massage...

28:37.645 --> 28:39.900
do you do?

28:44.447 --> 28:47.817
Is this what you've been
thinking about for the past half hour?

28:47.917 --> 28:49.658
No.

28:51.986 --> 28:56.830
- I was just kind of curious, if...
- Are you trying to ask me if I'm a hooker?

28:57.457 --> 28:59.526
- No.
- I prefer sex worker.

28:59.626 --> 29:03.334
- Sure, yeah.
- Not that it really matters.

29:04.028 --> 29:07.333
No, I get it. I get it.

29:09.033 --> 29:11.742
Do you have anything else
you want to ask me?

29:12.970 --> 29:14.818
Nope.

29:15.459 --> 29:17.252
Okay.

29:20.575 --> 29:22.642
Well, actually...

29:23.879 --> 29:26.221
are you okay with what you're doing?

29:31.218 --> 29:33.927
I mean, it's not perfect, but...
what the fuck is?

29:39.257 --> 29:41.699
I don't need to be saved.

29:50.867 --> 29:52.675
Mom?

29:53.502 --> 29:56.211
- Mom?
- In my room.

29:57.205 --> 29:59.041
Okay.

29:59.141 --> 30:02.310
Why don't you just hang out by the pool,
or get a drink or something?

30:02.410 --> 30:05.151
- Okay.
- Make yourself at home.

30:08.648 --> 30:11.451
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, honey.

30:12.283 --> 30:16.388
- It's really chilly in here.
- It's so hot outside I can't stand it.

30:16.488 --> 30:18.823
This much A.C. is gonna kill you.

30:18.923 --> 30:21.159
I didn't expect to see you this weekend.

30:21.859 --> 30:24.661
Well, I hope you don't mind,
but I brought a friend.

30:24.761 --> 30:26.965
What do you think of this?

30:27.065 --> 30:30.866
- It's nice.
- I'm going to re-decorate.

30:30.966 --> 30:34.502
- Why? I like it the way that it is.
- Oh, I like a change.

30:34.602 --> 30:36.934
Did you say you brought a friend?

30:37.615 --> 30:40.373
Yeah. Her name is Shiva...

30:40.473 --> 30:44.043
- That's unusual.
- Yeah.

30:44.961 --> 30:46.846
And...

30:47.246 --> 30:51.654
Well, she's not actually
just a friend. She's...

30:52.384 --> 30:54.986
she's my biological sister.

30:55.086 --> 30:57.115
Half-sister.

31:04.960 --> 31:08.970
I only just met her.
So it's new for me too.

31:09.831 --> 31:12.139
But she's really great.

31:12.466 --> 31:14.687
I think you'll like her.

31:15.302 --> 31:17.739
I didn't know you were...

31:20.639 --> 31:23.114
Why didn't you tell me about this?

31:24.408 --> 31:26.583
I don't know.

31:32.015 --> 31:34.757
Have you contacted your birth mother?

31:36.235 --> 31:38.116
She passed away.

31:39.555 --> 31:42.357
And I know that you
didn't want me to do that...

31:42.457 --> 31:45.478
but since Dad died, I...

31:46.378 --> 31:48.797
I don't know... I just...

31:50.214 --> 31:53.472
I just don't understand why you didn't
talk to me about this. Why so secret?

31:56.234 --> 31:59.405
Just because I love you,
and I didn't want to hurt you.

31:59.605 --> 32:02.345
So why did you bring her here then?

32:03.840 --> 32:06.349
I just wanted you to meet her.

32:08.611 --> 32:11.848
And she has, I don't know...
trouble with a boyfriend,

32:11.948 --> 32:15.599
I thought it would be nice
to have a night away.

32:17.485 --> 32:21.123
Life is difficult enough without
inviting problems into it, you know that.

32:21.223 --> 32:24.435
She's not a problem, Mom.

32:25.227 --> 32:27.295
I just feel bad for her.

32:27.395 --> 32:31.733
You know, she doesn't have any family
or anything, she doesn't have anybody.

32:32.733 --> 32:35.307
This is pretty, don't you think?

32:53.551 --> 32:54.893
Hey.

33:00.257 --> 33:02.420
Cody called.

33:03.094 --> 33:05.730
Did you speak to him?

33:05.830 --> 33:09.631
- He left a message.
- And?

33:13.034 --> 33:15.336
<i>Where the fuck are you?</i>

33:15.936 --> 33:17.839
<i>I swear to God, I just got out of jail.</i>

33:17.939 --> 33:21.608
<i>Shiva, if you're not home by the time
I get back, you're fucking dead.</i>

33:21.708 --> 33:24.048
<i>You understand?</i>

33:25.926 --> 33:28.435
What do you want to do?

33:31.647 --> 33:34.033
Oh, my God, isn't it too hot?

33:34.133 --> 33:36.652
Mom, this is Shiva.

33:36.752 --> 33:38.654
- Hi.
- Shiva, this is my mom, Martha.

33:38.754 --> 33:41.690
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

33:41.790 --> 33:45.493
- Where are you going?
- Back to L.A., on a date.

33:45.593 --> 33:48.895
- No way.
- Blind date. Lynn set it up.

33:48.995 --> 33:52.971
- I'm too old to be dating, but...
- You're never too old to date.

33:55.731 --> 33:58.861
Anyway, I hope you girls enjoy yourselves,
don't forget to...

33:58.961 --> 34:01.938
- leave the alarm on when you leave.
- Okay. Bye, Mom.

34:02.038 --> 34:05.674
- I know we'll be meeting again.
- I hope so.

34:05.774 --> 34:08.148
- This is Dex, I gotta take it. Sorry, Mom.
- See you.

34:08.547 --> 34:11.181
- Bye.
- Bye.

34:12.710 --> 34:14.246
Hello?

34:14.347 --> 34:16.746
<i>Hey, you. I was looking
at the business account,</i>

34:16.847 --> 34:19.581
looks like there's
a thousand dollars missing.

34:19.681 --> 34:21.350
- <i>Did you know that?</i>
- I know.

34:21.449 --> 34:24.953
<i>Wait, did you pay a bill?
Where did it go? I don't understand.</i>

34:25.053 --> 34:27.761
<i>It's that gas guzzler, again, isn't it?
We've got to get rid of it.</i>

34:27.880 --> 34:30.822
That's it. We've got to sell it this week.
No more discussion, please.

34:30.922 --> 34:34.225
It wasn't the car. Okay?
I gave it to Shiva.

34:34.324 --> 34:38.629
- <i>Wait, what?</i>
- I gave it to Shiva for her rent.

34:39.029 --> 34:41.964
- <i>Are you being serious right now?</i>
- No, I thought it was a good idea.

34:42.063 --> 34:44.266
It felt like the right thing to do.

34:44.565 --> 34:48.768
<i>Are you out of your mind? I cannot
believe that you did not call me, May.</i>

34:48.869 --> 34:51.704
<i>We're supposed to talk to each other
to make decisions like this.</i>

34:51.804 --> 34:53.739
<i>We're a team. This is unbelie...</i>

34:53.839 --> 34:55.774
<i>We need that money,
for the first month of rent,</i>

34:55.873 --> 34:59.077
<i>if we don't get enough students
then we're gonna...</i>

34:59.597 --> 35:01.198
Is this funny to you?

35:01.298 --> 35:05.215
No, I just... the line's breaking up,
I can't hear you anymore.

35:05.315 --> 35:07.016
- <i>May?</i>
- Hello?

35:07.116 --> 35:09.823
- <i>May?</i>
- Hello?

35:12.886 --> 35:15.589
Oh, he's pissed.

35:15.689 --> 35:18.290
And I haven't even told him
I'm out of town.

35:20.458 --> 35:23.095
You're a beautiful, powerful woman.

35:23.195 --> 35:26.036
Some old bitch told me that once.

35:30.934 --> 35:32.636
- Hey.
- <i>You wanna tell me what's going on?</i>

35:32.736 --> 35:35.800
No, I don't know what happened
back there, it just cut out.

35:35.900 --> 35:39.641
So listen, I am at my mom's place
at Santa Barbara with Shiva,

35:39.741 --> 35:42.183
and I will be home
in time for class tomorrow.

35:42.283 --> 35:45.062
- <i>What?</i>
- Yeah, and we did drive the Marlin,

35:45.162 --> 35:47.781
and we used an entire tank of gas,
and it was really fun.

35:47.881 --> 35:51.651
I love that car and I don't
want to sell it. Okay?

35:51.751 --> 35:55.361
I love you so much, Dex. Bye.

36:13.103 --> 36:16.006
"May is passionate
about sharing this practice

36:16.106 --> 36:18.909
"which so profoundly changed her life."

36:19.009 --> 36:22.486
"It gives her great joy
to see how peace unfolds

36:22.586 --> 36:25.764
in the lives of her students."

36:26.114 --> 36:28.526
It just sounds like bullshit.

36:30.419 --> 36:34.890
I mean, honestly, most of the people
that teach this wanna have a nice ass.

36:34.990 --> 36:37.993
Nothin' wrong with having a nice ass.

36:39.993 --> 36:42.464
You wanna see my page?

36:43.164 --> 36:47.807
- You have a webpage?
- An ad. Here, give me.

36:57.944 --> 37:00.479
"Angel will give you the sexiest massage"

37:00.579 --> 37:03.048
"with the happiest ending
you could dream of,"

37:03.148 --> 37:06.307
"and nothing gives her more pleasure."

37:07.085 --> 37:11.027
As if. It's all fucking bullshit.

37:12.955 --> 37:14.924
Don't take it so seriously.

37:15.024 --> 37:17.727
But it's different,
I mean, yoga is about truth.

37:17.827 --> 37:19.968
Isn't sex?

37:26.132 --> 37:29.201
What was it like the first time...

37:29.703 --> 37:33.439
that you did it... like...

37:34.439 --> 37:36.609
Well, how else do you say it?

37:37.309 --> 37:39.619
That I did it.

37:42.645 --> 37:44.749
Cody and I were at this party,

37:44.849 --> 37:47.852
and this guy came up to me,
and he was like...

37:47.952 --> 37:51.889
"I'll give you 500 bucks
if you come home with me."

37:51.989 --> 37:54.291
And of course I thought he was kidding.

37:54.391 --> 37:56.860
Then I realized he wasn't.

37:56.960 --> 38:01.430
And then, I thought
Cody would fucking freak...

38:01.530 --> 38:03.626
but he didn't.

38:07.000 --> 38:08.991
We needed the money.

38:17.543 --> 38:20.727
You gotta let your hair down
every once in a while.

38:33.791 --> 38:36.728
Like a fucking pro.

38:36.828 --> 38:38.696
Don't tell anybody.

38:39.118 --> 38:42.040
Oh, fuck, oh, I love this song.

38:51.940 --> 38:53.817
Thank you.

38:56.445 --> 38:59.652
- I'm not coming up.
- Come on. Come on.

40:14.553 --> 40:17.823
Yeah, she gave me
the money just like that.

40:18.223 --> 40:21.064
Easiest money I ever made.

40:22.224 --> 40:24.794
Yeah, I can get more, stop bitching at me.

40:24.894 --> 40:27.296
She's rich, okay?

40:27.396 --> 40:30.098
I'll be home this afternoon.

40:30.198 --> 40:32.625
Okay. Yeah, I love you. Bye.

40:38.804 --> 40:40.634
Hey.

40:44.176 --> 40:46.683
We should probably get goin'.

40:51.631 --> 40:53.690
Okay, yeah. Sure.

41:21.042 --> 41:23.885
I'm not trying to steal your money.

41:27.915 --> 41:32.097
I just said that because I don't
want him to kill me when I get home.

41:38.825 --> 41:41.200
If you don't want to go back, don't.

41:42.394 --> 41:43.796
Yeah?

41:54.038 --> 41:57.247
You can stay with me and Dex
for a few nights.

43:06.693 --> 43:10.212
Take this moment
to feel the calm in your body.

43:10.781 --> 43:14.222
To feel the peace
in every cell of your being.

43:24.825 --> 43:29.437
Rolling over onto your side, come up
into a comfortable, seated position.

43:32.932 --> 43:36.098
Put your hands on your heart.

43:38.070 --> 43:42.924
Gently opening your eyes, bringing
that sense of peace and oneness...

43:43.024 --> 43:45.042
to everything that you see today.

43:45.142 --> 43:48.383
- Namaste.
- Namaste.

43:49.143 --> 43:53.814
Okay, you guys, thank you so much.
See you next week, we're open.

43:53.914 --> 43:57.371
Very exciting. Bye, see you tomorrow.

44:01.718 --> 44:04.097
- Hey.
- Hey.

44:06.457 --> 44:09.026
So, what can I do for you?

44:09.126 --> 44:11.967
Shiva left this at our place.

44:13.228 --> 44:16.392
Wouldn't happen
to have seen her, would you?

44:21.268 --> 44:23.444
Well, that's ironic, right?

44:24.938 --> 44:26.815
"Shiva".

44:31.911 --> 44:36.550
You know, I was...
I was born in New Mexico.

44:37.250 --> 44:39.952
The home of the nuclear bomb.

44:40.052 --> 44:43.154
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, yeah.

44:43.254 --> 44:46.423
You know what the guy said who invented it,
when we saw the first one explode,

44:46.523 --> 44:48.829
you know what he said?

44:49.826 --> 44:53.124
He said... "I am Shiva...

44:53.696 --> 44:55.804
destroyer of worlds."

44:57.865 --> 45:01.569
You see, that's the thing about Shiva,
you know, you get too close to her,

45:01.669 --> 45:05.894
and everything you ever loved
can be destroyed, just like the bomb.

45:12.243 --> 45:15.618
That's funny, speak of the devil, right?

45:17.914 --> 45:19.457
What are you doing here?

45:19.557 --> 45:23.053
It's funny, 'cause I could ask the same
fucking thing to you. What are you doing?

45:23.153 --> 45:24.787
I'm...

45:24.887 --> 45:27.423
hanging out, I was just...

45:27.523 --> 45:31.067
- gonna... I was gonna come home soon.
- Oh, really?

45:32.160 --> 45:35.430
You know, that was so nice of you
to call and let me know.

45:35.530 --> 45:39.707
I mean, you girls been having
a nice time while I was in jail?

45:53.278 --> 45:55.586
Shiva's gonna stay here for a few nights.

45:57.648 --> 45:59.689
Oh, yeah?

46:00.299 --> 46:02.074
Yeah.

46:13.495 --> 46:15.223
I'm gonna get my stuff.

46:20.768 --> 46:23.137
Anyway, like I was saying...

46:23.237 --> 46:26.245
you never really know
what you're gonna get.

46:26.539 --> 46:32.117
And it's not like I imagine you two girls
having much in common, anyway, right?

46:33.144 --> 46:35.786
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

46:38.348 --> 46:40.373
Excuse me.

46:51.026 --> 46:54.363
- Please don't leave with him.
- You don't want to deal with this, trust me.

46:54.463 --> 46:57.665
- I don't care. I will call the police.
- What are they gonna do?

46:57.765 --> 47:02.016
- They will make him leave.
- Like he wouldn't come back. I gotta go.

47:02.116 --> 47:03.937
Please.

47:04.437 --> 47:08.240
Look, remember how you said
that it was fate that we met?

47:08.340 --> 47:12.777
That's what it's like with me and Cody,
so there's no use in fighting it.

47:12.877 --> 47:17.120
This is exactly what he wants you
to think, but you have a choice.

47:33.293 --> 47:37.097
Pressure, that's it, man, pressure.
I understand this guy, right?

47:37.197 --> 47:38.465
- Dex.
- Dex.

47:38.565 --> 47:42.268
Dex is amazing, he was just telling me
how yoga might help me with my headaches.

47:42.368 --> 47:45.103
You know, apparently,
I have too much stress in my life.

47:45.203 --> 47:47.625
- I don't even know how I get up in the morning.
- Let's go.

47:47.725 --> 47:50.909
But you see, the trouble is,
my girlfriend here, she's always in a rush,

47:51.009 --> 47:53.057
makes me crazy.

47:53.776 --> 47:56.378
Hey, man, I know exactly what you mean.

47:56.728 --> 47:59.680
- If you're interested seriously, take that.
- Baby, he doesn't want that.

47:59.780 --> 48:03.483
- Oh, Pico and Lincoln, yeah.
- Exactly. That's right above the print shop.

48:03.583 --> 48:06.285
- Okay, I'll look for it. Thank you.
- Cody.

48:06.385 --> 48:10.427
Good to meet you. Yeah, Dex.
All right. Take care.

48:11.021 --> 48:12.996
See you guys.

48:15.291 --> 48:16.934
Why were you so nice to him?

48:18.762 --> 48:21.843
- He's your sister's boyfriend.
- He is her pimp.

48:30.770 --> 48:32.844
Shiva's a whore?

48:33.955 --> 48:35.558
Don't call her that.

48:36.208 --> 48:38.710
What do you want me to call her?

48:38.910 --> 48:40.923
Prostitute?

48:42.480 --> 48:44.716
A sex worker.

48:45.416 --> 48:49.420
- It doesn't make a difference.
- Yeah, it does.

48:49.520 --> 48:52.556
Fine, she's a sex worker.

48:52.856 --> 48:56.208
- And you gave her our money.
- You know, Dex, I just wanted to help her.

48:56.308 --> 48:59.093
She probably set you up from the beginning
so she could get our money.

48:59.193 --> 49:02.345
- Did you even think about that, May?
- Well, if she did, she is welcome to it.

49:02.445 --> 49:04.697
She needs it a lot more than we do.

49:04.797 --> 49:07.366
You're telling me
that this woman is a prost...

49:07.466 --> 49:10.028
a sex worker, and it's okay
if she comes into our home?

49:10.128 --> 49:11.953
Why does it matter to you
so much what she does?

49:12.053 --> 49:14.322
Because I don't want that energy
in my house. And neither should you.

49:14.422 --> 49:16.640
What energy?

49:16.740 --> 49:18.943
Okay, stop. Let's just stop.

49:19.843 --> 49:21.883
Let's just leave this.

49:44.966 --> 49:48.694
Let's go. We're gonna be late.

50:51.362 --> 50:54.298
- Do you have the info?
- Here.

50:54.398 --> 50:55.966
That's awesome.

50:56.266 --> 50:58.587
- We'll definitely be there.
- See you guys tomorrow.

50:58.687 --> 51:01.610
- See you. Bye.
- Bye.

51:08.343 --> 51:10.045
What is that?

51:10.145 --> 51:13.514
It's the money that I gave Shiva, and the
key to our place that she didn't take.

51:13.614 --> 51:18.212
- Good. This is literally karma in action.
- I have to get this to her right now.

51:18.312 --> 51:20.386
May, just... let's take a while
and think about what you're doing.

51:20.486 --> 51:22.121
I don't want to take a moment
to think about anything.

51:22.221 --> 51:24.289
- We'll be coming tomorrow.
- Excellent.

51:24.389 --> 51:27.358
- Namaste. Namaste.
- Namaste. Okay, bye.

51:27.458 --> 51:29.488
Let's not talk about this here right now.
This is not appropriate.

51:29.588 --> 51:32.061
You know what? Fuck appropriate.

51:32.161 --> 51:35.330
- Let's just talk about this outside.
- ...is this what you're interested in?

51:35.430 --> 51:38.803
This is all you fucking care about?
Then you can fucking take it!

51:39.133 --> 51:41.006
May.

51:47.305 --> 51:50.008
May, stop right there!

51:50.308 --> 51:52.043
Fuck you.

51:52.343 --> 51:55.979
- Don't you ever touch me like that.
- What is happening to you?

51:56.079 --> 51:59.182
You're in there, and you're talking
about how you want to heal people?

51:59.282 --> 52:02.418
But you only want to heal people
who have money.

52:02.518 --> 52:05.654
I know one person,
right now, who needs help.

52:05.754 --> 52:10.594
Okay, I'm not saying don't help her,
I'm just saying think this through.

52:13.194 --> 52:16.097
She didn't take the money,
so she can't pay her rent.

52:16.197 --> 52:19.400
And she doesn't have our key,
so she has no place to go.

52:19.500 --> 52:22.075
You don't even know who she really is.

52:26.238 --> 52:28.680
I don't think you know who I really am.

52:34.344 --> 52:36.815
Where are you going, May?

52:42.584 --> 52:44.387
May!

53:38.005 --> 53:40.040
Shiva?

53:40.340 --> 53:42.699
It's me, it's May.

53:44.644 --> 53:48.154
Can you please open the door?
I really need to talk to you.

53:54.785 --> 53:58.761
I know you're in there,
and I'm not leaving until I see you.

54:05.026 --> 54:07.071
What do you want?

54:12.366 --> 54:14.435
You forgot these.

54:14.535 --> 54:16.715
I don't need 'em.

54:17.938 --> 54:20.113
Can we talk, please?

54:21.152 --> 54:23.297
Can I come in?

54:35.320 --> 54:37.790
I don't need anything, okay?

54:38.590 --> 54:40.049
I know you don't.

54:41.359 --> 54:43.834
So why did you come here?

54:45.595 --> 54:49.232
- Just take these from me, okay?
- I don't need 'em.

54:49.332 --> 54:53.575
I said I don't need 'em.
I'm not coming over.

54:56.771 --> 54:59.207
What is that on your neck?

54:59.307 --> 55:01.681
It's nothing, okay? Just leave.

55:09.581 --> 55:11.587
Come with me.

55:14.284 --> 55:17.226
What's the fucking point? He'll kill me.

55:18.054 --> 55:19.723
I'm not gonna let that happen.

55:19.823 --> 55:23.410
Oh, yeah, and how are you going
to stop it? By chanting?

55:25.692 --> 55:28.128
- He loves me.
- This is not love.

55:28.228 --> 55:31.793
Yeah, well, it's the closest thing
I've got, so...

55:31.893 --> 55:34.606
You have me now.

55:39.436 --> 55:41.512
I love you.

55:43.606 --> 55:45.688
I love you.

55:48.377 --> 55:50.535
You don't count.

55:50.635 --> 55:52.652
Why not?

55:54.817 --> 55:57.057
Because you're a girl.

55:58.819 --> 56:01.631
Since when do girls not count?

56:10.729 --> 56:12.605
You count.

56:19.103 --> 56:23.179
You fucking count.

56:32.849 --> 56:34.723
Fuck!

56:39.653 --> 56:42.390
- Get in the fucking closet.
- I'm not gonna get in the closet.

56:42.490 --> 56:45.945
- You and me, we're gonna leave together...
- Get in the fucking closet.

56:46.626 --> 56:48.862
- Hi, baby.
- Hey.

56:48.962 --> 56:51.231
What you watchin'?

56:51.731 --> 56:54.539
Get your ass ready,
I've got a date for you.

56:56.300 --> 56:58.970
I want you to look real pretty too.

56:59.070 --> 57:00.705
Don't I always look pretty?

57:00.805 --> 57:04.398
Yeah, you always look pretty,
just put some fucking makeup on.

57:06.708 --> 57:09.678
- Who's the date?
- Lonely Ed.

57:10.678 --> 57:13.223
- No.
- Come on, man. He likes you, that guy.

57:13.323 --> 57:16.113
I already told you,
I'm not seeing that freak again.

57:16.513 --> 57:18.518
- We need the fucking money.
- I'm serious.

57:18.618 --> 57:21.554
I don't like that guy,
he really fucked me up last time.

57:21.654 --> 57:23.589
Come here.

57:24.289 --> 57:26.445
Come on, what?

57:26.824 --> 57:29.979
You're not afraid of him, are you?
Are you?

57:30.079 --> 57:31.228
I don't know.

57:31.328 --> 57:35.248
Come on, that's bullshit.
Who loves you? Who loves you?

57:35.898 --> 57:37.099
- You do.
- Yeah, you're right.

57:37.199 --> 57:40.963
I'd walk to the end of the earth on broken
shards of glass for you, you know that?

57:41.063 --> 57:42.370
- All right?
- I know.

57:42.470 --> 57:44.882
So what are you? What the fuck are you?

57:45.272 --> 57:47.774
You're a fearless fucking tiger,
that's what you are.

57:47.874 --> 57:51.148
So come on, give me these tiger titties
for a minute...

57:55.511 --> 57:58.018
I got five minutes, so...

57:58.118 --> 58:00.364
warm you up a little bit.

58:09.523 --> 58:13.866
Baby, I'm hungry.
Can we go get something to eat?

58:16.628 --> 58:19.066
Are you out of your fucking mind?

58:20.466 --> 58:24.841
How many fucking times have I got to
tell you, I gotta fucking pay this rent.

58:30.339 --> 58:32.795
Jesus Christ.

58:35.709 --> 58:38.445
Baby, I don't wanna see Ed,
I wanna... I wanna be with you.

58:38.545 --> 58:40.947
Let's go have some fun.

58:46.484 --> 58:49.061
You've got the fucking money for that?

58:50.188 --> 58:52.395
You got the fucking money?

58:58.894 --> 59:02.364
Open the money drawer. Open it.

59:02.464 --> 59:05.038
Open the fucking drawer!

59:12.572 --> 59:14.947
You see any money in there?

59:18.344 --> 59:20.452
What do you see?

59:22.280 --> 59:25.748
Yeah. Give it to me.

59:39.762 --> 59:42.106
You wanna fuck us up?

59:45.817 --> 59:50.055
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't
shoot you right now, you fucking bitch.

59:50.505 --> 59:52.946
Because you love me.

59:55.107 --> 59:57.482
Well, I fucking hate you.

59:58.076 --> 01:00:00.318
I fucking hate you.

01:00:31.371 --> 01:00:33.406
What the fuck?

01:00:33.506 --> 01:00:35.627
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:00:35.727 --> 01:00:38.216
What the fuck is this shit?

01:00:43.180 --> 01:00:45.015
Don't...

01:00:45.415 --> 01:00:46.977
touch her.

01:00:50.587 --> 01:00:52.824
Are you okay?

01:00:54.424 --> 01:00:56.830
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

01:00:57.159 --> 01:00:59.501
Tell her the truth.

01:01:06.833 --> 01:01:08.708
Tell her.

01:01:11.804 --> 01:01:14.212
I'm not your sister.

01:01:17.375 --> 01:01:20.384
I just wanted your money.

01:01:32.022 --> 01:01:34.499
I'll see you downstairs.

01:02:19.501 --> 01:02:23.572
You've gotta be fucking kidding me.
You owe me double now.

01:02:24.072 --> 01:02:27.708
Yeah, all right, all right.
Yeah, we can make that happen.

01:02:28.208 --> 01:02:30.282
Yeah, she's available.

01:02:33.078 --> 01:02:35.353
A little midnight special.

01:02:37.882 --> 01:02:41.880
All right, I'll have her cleaned up
and send her over in an hour. Bye.

01:05:57.271 --> 01:05:59.574
I need to speak to Shiva.

01:05:59.674 --> 01:06:02.142
Did you just climb over my gate?

01:06:02.242 --> 01:06:05.146
The girl... the girl that just came
in here. I need to speak to her.

01:06:05.246 --> 01:06:07.037
You've got the wrong house.

01:06:37.207 --> 01:06:39.365
I'm gonna call the cops, if you...

01:06:39.465 --> 01:06:41.817
What the fuck?

01:06:46.482 --> 01:06:48.559
Go ahead.

01:06:49.436 --> 01:06:51.505
Call them.

01:06:54.455 --> 01:06:56.303
Listen...

01:06:56.925 --> 01:06:59.126
We're all consenting adults here.

01:06:59.226 --> 01:07:02.331
I just watched a man threaten to kill her,
so she would come here.

01:07:02.431 --> 01:07:04.971
So don't talk to me about consent.

01:07:05.465 --> 01:07:07.537
Okay, just...

01:07:08.602 --> 01:07:11.302
Sh... she's upstairs.

01:07:11.402 --> 01:07:15.207
Shiva, come on down. It's okay.

01:07:16.407 --> 01:07:18.114
I don't think she can hear you.

01:07:21.143 --> 01:07:25.114
- Take me to her.
- Look, why don't you put the gun down?

01:07:25.914 --> 01:07:27.996
Just take me to her.

01:07:28.096 --> 01:07:32.153
I had no idea that she came here
under any duress, I swear.

01:07:32.253 --> 01:07:34.121
Slowly.

01:07:34.621 --> 01:07:36.277
Move slowly.

01:07:55.340 --> 01:07:57.382
Open it.

01:08:03.831 --> 01:08:06.156
May, what the fuck?

01:08:07.952 --> 01:08:09.687
Give me the key.

01:08:09.787 --> 01:08:12.756
- Why don't you put the gun down?
- Give me the fucking keys!

01:08:12.856 --> 01:08:15.394
- The keys in my case. I'll get it.
- Shut up and get it!

01:08:15.494 --> 01:08:17.893
- Do not let him go over there.
- It's in my case.

01:08:18.037 --> 01:08:19.461
- Hey... How?
- Take the safety off.

01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:22.229
Pull it back, take the safe...

01:08:22.496 --> 01:08:24.096
What, are you out of your mind?

01:08:24.197 --> 01:08:27.100
I said shut the fuck up,
so shut the fuck up.

01:08:28.401 --> 01:08:31.395
Go to the case. Go to the case.

01:08:32.438 --> 01:08:34.612
Move over there.

01:08:35.706 --> 01:08:37.747
Stay right there.

01:08:43.379 --> 01:08:45.182
Right, right.

01:08:45.282 --> 01:08:47.823
Oh, fuck. There's a gun in there.

01:08:53.421 --> 01:08:55.663
Okay. Okay?

01:08:59.227 --> 01:09:01.296
Take his gun.

01:09:01.796 --> 01:09:04.809
- What? Why? Why would I steal his gun?
- You stole Cody's gun.

01:09:04.908 --> 01:09:07.104
That was different.

01:09:08.934 --> 01:09:12.676
I'm not leaving him with a fucking gun,
okay? Take the gun.

01:09:15.337 --> 01:09:16.707
Go, go, go, go.

01:09:17.107 --> 01:09:19.975
- Stay there.
- Wait, wait, wait.

01:09:20.475 --> 01:09:22.692
- Handcuff yourself to the bed.
- What?

01:09:22.792 --> 01:09:25.828
Handcuff yourself to the fucking bed.

01:09:33.618 --> 01:09:35.676
Let's go.

01:09:35.776 --> 01:09:38.594
Go. Go.

01:09:41.826 --> 01:09:45.969
- I really don't want to steal from him.
- Okay, fine. Let's just fucking go.

01:09:49.532 --> 01:09:52.163
You think those are his kids?

01:09:52.264 --> 01:09:54.476
Yeah, probably.

01:09:55.937 --> 01:10:00.412
- That is fucked.
- That's life. Let's go.

01:10:03.875 --> 01:10:05.711
No.

01:10:06.411 --> 01:10:09.485
- No.
- May, what the fuck?

01:10:09.746 --> 01:10:11.571
What the fuck are you doing?

01:10:13.816 --> 01:10:15.876
What the fuck?

01:10:17.020 --> 01:10:20.023
The next time you're about to pay
to slap a woman around,

01:10:20.123 --> 01:10:23.126
I just want you to stop
and take a deep breath,

01:10:23.226 --> 01:10:27.412
and remember,
that that is someone's daughter.

01:10:27.512 --> 01:10:29.890
What are you, a fucking life coach?

01:10:29.990 --> 01:10:32.278
I'm a yoga teacher.

01:10:37.305 --> 01:10:39.013
Namaste, motherfucker.

01:10:42.275 --> 01:10:44.478
Now we can go.

01:10:44.578 --> 01:10:48.438
You're fucking insane. I love it.

01:10:51.784 --> 01:10:54.520
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God is right.

01:10:54.620 --> 01:10:57.455
- You are fucking crazy.
- Holy shit.

01:10:57.555 --> 01:10:59.757
I am fucking crazy, I am.

01:10:59.857 --> 01:11:02.626
Dude... you are fucking crazy.

01:11:02.726 --> 01:11:06.528
You should've seen his face when I went
back up there. You should've seen his face.

01:11:06.628 --> 01:11:09.669
I can't believe you just fucking did that
for me. Why did you do that for me?

01:11:09.769 --> 01:11:11.616
Seriously?

01:11:11.832 --> 01:11:14.934
I just... I know that you don't
want to be saved, and all...

01:11:15.034 --> 01:11:16.302
Fuck what I said.

01:11:16.402 --> 01:11:20.806
Oh, my God, nobody has ever done
anything like that for me before, ever.

01:11:20.906 --> 01:11:22.746
Fuck.

01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:26.515
Holy shit, it was amazing.

01:11:32.347 --> 01:11:34.969
I lied, I am your sister.

01:11:42.122 --> 01:11:44.495
I wouldn't have cared.

01:11:45.459 --> 01:11:47.933
It wouldn't have mattered.

01:11:58.667 --> 01:11:59.928
Fuck, it's Cody.

01:12:01.869 --> 01:12:03.681
Don't answer.

01:12:09.108 --> 01:12:11.382
Where are we going?

01:12:19.249 --> 01:12:22.653
- Where are you?
- Hey, Dex...

01:12:22.753 --> 01:12:26.482
can you just do something for me, please?
Can you just...

01:12:26.982 --> 01:12:28.825
there's a bunch of keys,
in a box by my shrine.

01:12:28.925 --> 01:12:32.162
Can you get them
and can you just bring them to me?

01:12:32.762 --> 01:12:35.298
<i>Why don't you just come home?</i>

01:12:35.398 --> 01:12:39.092
<i>Listen, May. I'd just like to talk to you.</i>

01:12:39.401 --> 01:12:43.037
Just... meet me
at the parking lot on Main.

01:12:44.037 --> 01:12:46.726
<i>Please, just do this for me.</i>

01:12:47.308 --> 01:12:49.943
<i>Make sure no one follows you.</i>

01:12:50.043 --> 01:12:52.785
Follow... May, what are you talking about?

01:13:17.468 --> 01:13:19.437
May.

01:13:19.537 --> 01:13:21.344
Hey.

01:13:22.404 --> 01:13:23.911
Have you got 'em?

01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:29.360
Okay, do you want to just tell me
what's going on? Are you okay?

01:13:30.845 --> 01:13:32.581
Yeah.

01:13:33.681 --> 01:13:37.803
Then you wanna tell me why I'm here in
a parking lot, why you couldn't come home?

01:13:38.617 --> 01:13:41.558
I just can't talk right now.
Do you have the keys?

01:13:45.488 --> 01:13:47.863
Okay, May, I just...

01:13:48.163 --> 01:13:51.938
I wanted to apologize for earlier, I...

01:13:53.355 --> 01:13:56.710
I should not have gotten mad like that.
That's not... You know me, that's not me.

01:13:56.810 --> 01:13:59.112
I know, I know.

01:13:59.701 --> 01:14:02.036
I'm sorry, too.

01:14:02.136 --> 01:14:03.488
I'm sorry.

01:14:05.154 --> 01:14:06.818
Yeah.

01:14:16.014 --> 01:14:17.835
Okay.

01:14:32.162 --> 01:14:34.052
I...

01:14:35.366 --> 01:14:37.976
I think I need some space.

01:14:39.635 --> 01:14:41.500
May, what are you...

01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:43.844
We can work this out.

01:14:43.944 --> 01:14:45.945
I don't know.

01:14:50.101 --> 01:14:53.780
- I'll... I'll call. I'll call you.
- May, wait.

01:14:55.180 --> 01:14:57.420
Don't go with her.

01:15:03.469 --> 01:15:05.271
May.

01:15:10.125 --> 01:15:12.349
I'm sorry, Dex.

01:15:15.496 --> 01:15:17.338
May.

01:15:42.422 --> 01:15:45.731
- I wasn't expecting you tonight.
- Surprise visit.

01:15:54.733 --> 01:15:56.669
Yeah, we'll stay here tonight.

01:15:56.769 --> 01:16:00.239
And then, you know, we'll just see...
we'll see what happens tomorrow.

01:16:00.339 --> 01:16:03.709
- Sounds good.
- We'll figure it out.

01:16:03.809 --> 01:16:05.636
We will.

01:16:16.619 --> 01:16:19.122
You didn't give him this address, did you?

01:16:19.222 --> 01:16:20.996
No.

01:16:31.598 --> 01:16:33.601
Are you sure your mom's not home?

01:16:33.701 --> 01:16:36.376
Yeah, she's in L.A. tonight.

01:16:39.838 --> 01:16:41.636
Okay.

01:17:02.042 --> 01:17:05.329
- Oh, my God. Mom?
- Oh, May.

01:17:05.429 --> 01:17:07.698
I'm so sorry, I didn't know you were here.

01:17:07.798 --> 01:17:09.637
Christ!

01:17:09.737 --> 01:17:12.108
You scared the life out of me.

01:17:13.169 --> 01:17:16.076
- God. Jesus.
- Sorry.

01:17:17.570 --> 01:17:20.999
- Oh, my God, what happened to your face?
- I had a peel today.

01:17:21.099 --> 01:17:23.276
God, you scared me.

01:17:23.376 --> 01:17:25.078
Hey, how was your date?

01:17:25.978 --> 01:17:29.274
- What is going on?
- Nothing.

01:17:29.374 --> 01:17:32.187
Nothing, we just had fun,
we just came back.

01:17:32.287 --> 01:17:34.084
Can we talk privately?

01:17:34.184 --> 01:17:38.154
It's okay, you can talk freely
in front of Shiva, it's cool.

01:17:38.254 --> 01:17:41.490
No, it's not cool, young lady.
This is not cool.

01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:44.926
Dex told me what you did with the money.

01:17:45.026 --> 01:17:48.229
Well, you were the one who told me
to put it to good use.

01:17:48.829 --> 01:17:51.002
Not to give it to a prostitute.

01:17:53.264 --> 01:17:55.867
- Jesus, Mom.
- It's okay.

01:17:56.267 --> 01:17:58.313
It's fine.

01:18:00.470 --> 01:18:02.972
Okay, you know...
we're just gonna rest for a little bit,

01:18:03.072 --> 01:18:05.921
and then we're gonna leave
in the morning. Okay?

01:18:06.334 --> 01:18:07.642
This is crazy.

01:18:07.742 --> 01:18:12.213
I'm really sorry. I didn't...
mean to cause any trouble.

01:18:12.313 --> 01:18:15.516
And I'm really sorry that we woke you up,

01:18:15.616 --> 01:18:18.758
but we would not have come here
if we knew you were going to be here.

01:18:20.853 --> 01:18:22.555
Do you want some tea?

01:18:22.655 --> 01:18:25.062
No, I don't want some tea.

01:18:25.289 --> 01:18:27.981
I want some respect in my own home.

01:19:03.922 --> 01:19:05.730
Mom.

01:19:09.009 --> 01:19:10.800
Mom, who was that?

01:19:12.062 --> 01:19:14.231
Her boyfriend is picking her up.

01:19:14.331 --> 01:19:17.338
He's at the gate,
I told him to come and get her.

01:19:22.502 --> 01:19:26.373
Shiva, get dressed.
We've got to get out of here.

01:19:26.473 --> 01:19:29.907
- What's going on?
- Cody's here.

01:19:30.007 --> 01:19:31.882
What?

01:19:33.076 --> 01:19:35.981
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

01:19:37.923 --> 01:19:40.622
No, no, no, no, no.

01:19:42.417 --> 01:19:45.293
You should be with your boyfriend,
you should go home.

01:19:46.921 --> 01:19:48.818
Hello?

01:19:51.322 --> 01:19:53.811
I know. I'm sorry.

01:19:57.594 --> 01:19:59.802
I'm sorry.

01:20:04.166 --> 01:20:07.179
- Okay. Okay. I'm coming!
- Mom, call the police.

01:20:07.279 --> 01:20:08.816
- No, please.
- Call the police.

01:20:08.916 --> 01:20:12.073
Please don't. Please don't call the police.
I'm sorry if I was any trouble.

01:20:12.173 --> 01:20:15.709
- Mom, why the fuck did you let him in here?
- Open the fucking door!

01:20:15.809 --> 01:20:17.990
I'm going, okay?

01:20:21.714 --> 01:20:23.649
I'm sorry if I was any trouble.

01:20:23.749 --> 01:20:25.920
Stop fucking around, the game's over.
Let's go home.

01:20:26.020 --> 01:20:28.254
Your daughter's amazing.

01:20:29.719 --> 01:20:31.795
I'm coming!

01:20:42.264 --> 01:20:44.166
Shiva!

01:20:44.266 --> 01:20:46.001
Trust me.

01:20:46.101 --> 01:20:47.869
I swear to God, I'm gonna count to ten,

01:20:47.969 --> 01:20:50.537
and then I'm gonna kick
the fucking door in, you understand?

01:20:50.637 --> 01:20:52.509
One...

01:20:53.706 --> 01:20:56.476
- Two...
- I love you.

01:20:57.176 --> 01:20:59.039
Three...

01:21:00.079 --> 01:21:01.453
Four...

01:21:03.914 --> 01:21:06.767
- Five...
- I love you.

01:21:07.683 --> 01:21:09.519
Six... Open the fucking door!

01:21:09.619 --> 01:21:12.727
I'm fucking coming, Cody, shut up!

01:21:19.026 --> 01:21:22.733
I don't know why you are
so attached to her, I really don't.

01:21:26.498 --> 01:21:30.000
We shouldn't have to deal with it,
she is not our family.

01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:33.477
- Get off me! Get off me!
- Get in the...

01:21:34.937 --> 01:21:38.178
- Fuck...
- Get off...

01:21:40.574 --> 01:21:42.781
Get off me!

01:21:45.811 --> 01:21:49.081
Oh, that's cute. What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna fucking shoot me?

01:21:49.181 --> 01:21:52.656
I love you, you stupid fuck.
I ain't done with you.

01:21:55.052 --> 01:21:58.721
Are you trying to kill me? Are you
trying to fucking kill me, you bitch?

01:21:58.821 --> 01:22:00.819
You wanna shoot me?

01:22:00.919 --> 01:22:03.297
After everything I've fucking...

01:22:04.058 --> 01:22:06.638
Cody... get off her.

01:22:07.628 --> 01:22:11.938
- Go fuck yourself. Shut the fuck up!
- I said, get off!

01:22:14.600 --> 01:22:18.642
And what the fuck you gonna do about it?
Are you gonna shoot me?

01:22:20.170 --> 01:22:22.930
You know what she is, right?

01:22:23.240 --> 01:22:25.525
She's a fucking whore...

01:22:29.175 --> 01:22:31.361
You fucking bitch.

01:22:31.681 --> 01:22:33.269
Shiva...

01:22:33.369 --> 01:22:36.041
is... free.

01:22:36.485 --> 01:22:39.321
You are never gonna see her again.

01:22:39.771 --> 01:22:40.887
Say it.

01:22:44.557 --> 01:22:47.399
Shiva is free.

01:22:49.928 --> 01:22:52.703
You know what? Go fuck...
