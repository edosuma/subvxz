00:05.964 --> 00:08.258
Prue, have you seen my purse?

00:08.425 --> 00:10.177
In the kitchen.
Have you seen my keys?

00:10.344 --> 00:12.971
They're by the TV.

00:16.265 --> 00:18.435
I can't find my plane ticket.

00:19.311 --> 00:22.606
- Did I give it to you?
- Maybe you packed it.

00:22.773 --> 00:24.775
I didn't pack it. I just saw it.

00:26.000 --> 00:32.073
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:36.036 --> 00:39.706
- I can't believe it. It worked.
- Found it.

00:39.873 --> 00:42.876
Didn't you hear me looking for this?
What are you doing on the furniture?

00:43.084 --> 00:46.212
No, you don't understand. I've been
practicing how to call a premonition,

00:46.379 --> 00:49.799
and I did it. I saw a future event
on command.

00:49.966 --> 00:53.845
Oh, and that's the good news. The bad
news is I saw you missing your flight.

00:54.054 --> 00:59.059
Oh, great. If I don't get to Honolulu for
the convention, my boss will fire me.

00:59.267 --> 01:00.602
We can't let that happen,

01:00.769 --> 01:03.104
especially since my job's hanging
by a thread as it is.

01:03.271 --> 01:05.815
- Since when?
- Oh, since all the demon-hunting

01:05.982 --> 01:10.236
- time-off I've been taking lately.
- I am so behind. I didn't go shopping

01:10.403 --> 01:15.200
or pay the bills or call the cable guy
or cancel my hair appointment.

01:15.408 --> 01:17.160
Don't worry about it, sweetie,
I'll do it.

01:17.368 --> 01:19.579
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I mean, you've got time, right?

01:20.330 --> 01:22.999
Okay, so listen, we have stopped
Phoebe's premonitions

01:23.207 --> 01:26.961
from coming true before.
Hopefully we can do it again. Let's go.

01:27.128 --> 01:28.588
Okay, but wait, wait.

01:29.589 --> 01:34.260
I just realized the two of you haven't
really ever been alone together.

01:34.427 --> 01:38.389
Piper, we're big girls now. I don't think
we need you as a buffer anymore.

01:38.598 --> 01:40.057
Well, what about demon stuff?

01:40.224 --> 01:43.019
What if something happens
and you need the power of three?

01:43.186 --> 01:46.022
Well, then the power of two
will just have to do.

01:46.981 --> 01:49.150
- Good one.
- All right, let's go.

01:49.317 --> 01:51.319
Hey, Phoebe,
will you pick up my dry cleaning

01:51.485 --> 01:54.113
on the way back from the market,
please?

01:54.322 --> 01:57.074
Yeah, and talk to the gardeners
about the weeds.

01:57.283 --> 02:01.120
- And light bulbs, we need light bulbs.
- Sure, I'll just add it to my list.

02:01.329 --> 02:04.332
- Great, thanks. Bye.
- Go, go.

02:06.167 --> 02:09.753
I'm not even married,
and already I'm a housewife.

02:13.174 --> 02:15.634
Hello. Hey, Marianne.

02:15.801 --> 02:19.388
Oh, jeez, I completely forgot
about Alcatraz.

02:19.555 --> 02:23.017
No, I can't go.
I have a million errands to run.

02:24.268 --> 02:27.479
You know what, I'll be right over.

02:35.988 --> 02:38.032
You don't seriously plan
on spending the rest

02:38.198 --> 02:39.742
of eternity marooned here, do you?

02:39.950 --> 02:43.245
I'll find a way off this rock
on my own, don't worry.

02:44.788 --> 02:47.082
Who are you kidding, Jackson?

02:47.249 --> 02:49.752
You've been stuck here ever since
they executed you.

02:49.960 --> 02:53.922
Thirty-six long years,
trapped between life and death.

02:54.089 --> 02:55.758
Big deal.

02:58.469 --> 03:00.596
I've learned how
to do things in that time,

03:00.762 --> 03:06.101
break the physical plane,
prepare for my revenge.

03:06.268 --> 03:09.062
Revenge, how mortal.

03:09.271 --> 03:11.106
Go to hell.

03:11.940 --> 03:14.443
That's what I do, only never alone.

03:14.651 --> 03:18.780
I ferry souls there, every one I can
get my little hands on, so to speak.

03:18.989 --> 03:21.199
Yeah, well, you're not
gonna get your little hands

03:21.366 --> 03:23.368
on this one, lady, so just forget it.

03:23.577 --> 03:26.246
Don't worry, Jackson.
I don't want your soul.

03:26.455 --> 03:31.209
I want a witch's.
They're prize catches. Trophies.

03:31.418 --> 03:33.003
So, what's that got to do with me?

03:33.378 --> 03:38.341
If you let me get you off the island
to get your revenge,

03:38.508 --> 03:40.010
witches will try to stop you.

03:40.552 --> 03:45.098
And the only way they can do that
is to become vulnerable to me.

03:45.265 --> 03:47.392
Then I'll have them right
where I want them.

03:50.061 --> 03:52.564
Speaking of witches.

03:52.772 --> 03:55.984
Twenty-eight inmates died here,
nine while attempting to escape,

03:56.151 --> 03:57.902
and four by execution.

03:58.945 --> 04:02.699
Legend has it that one of them
still haunts the prison to this very day.

04:02.866 --> 04:05.827
The ghost of Alcatraz,
believed to reside in this very cell.

04:06.286 --> 04:09.998
- The ghost, oh, jeez.
- Let's see if he's in, shall we?

04:18.214 --> 04:23.052
Now, if you listen closely, you can
actually hear the ghost's cries.

04:25.513 --> 04:28.182
There, hear him?

04:28.349 --> 04:29.851
What an idiot.

04:30.310 --> 04:34.230
Look at him as your
"get out of jail free" card.

04:35.398 --> 04:39.277
- Oh, my God.
- Marianne, call 911, quick.

04:40.903 --> 04:43.573
What did you do? Who are you?

04:43.781 --> 04:46.200
- You can see me?
- Forget her for now.

04:46.409 --> 04:49.537
There's your ride off the island.
Hop in.

04:50.121 --> 04:53.791
Oh, no. No, what are you...? Don't...

04:58.462 --> 05:02.425
Hope you enjoyed the tour. See you.

06:39.896 --> 06:41.690
Bye.

06:53.243 --> 06:56.538
In all honesty, Prue, if it weren't
for you, I'm not sure the auction house

06:56.746 --> 06:58.957
would've been able
to stave off bankruptcy.

06:59.499 --> 07:02.127
- Thank you.
- Oh, don't thank me yet.

07:02.752 --> 07:05.547
Now, I have tolerated
your unexplained absences

07:05.714 --> 07:08.508
and the endless family emergencies,

07:08.717 --> 07:12.387
but no more. Buyers interested in
purchasing Buckland's will be visiting

07:12.554 --> 07:15.557
in the next two days, and it's important
we make a big impression.

07:17.100 --> 07:20.311
It's important that you make
a big impression

07:20.478 --> 07:24.065
if you expect to keep your job.
Do I make myself clear?

07:24.232 --> 07:26.234
Perfectly.

07:26.442 --> 07:28.903
I'm sorry, Prue, but your sister's
on the phone.

07:29.445 --> 07:30.905
I'll call her back.

07:31.114 --> 07:33.658
She says it's an emergency.

07:35.368 --> 07:37.829
Hey, have you ever heard of
the ghost of Alcatraz?

07:38.037 --> 07:40.581
Are you kidding me? This is why
you pulled me out of a meeting?

07:40.748 --> 07:44.377
<i>No, Prue, you don't understand.
I think the ghost really exists.</i>

07:44.544 --> 07:48.047
- Did you see it?
- No, of course not,

07:48.214 --> 07:51.467
I mean, how could I?
I wasn't at Alcatraz.

07:51.634 --> 07:53.886
I had way too much work
around here to do.

07:54.095 --> 07:56.430
So then what makes you think
that there was a ghost?

07:57.598 --> 08:02.270
My friend saw it. Marianne.
You know Marianne.

08:02.436 --> 08:05.106
Actually, she thinks she saw
two ghosts.

08:05.314 --> 08:08.025
<i>Or the other one may be something
else. She's not really sure.</i>

08:08.192 --> 08:10.319
- Phoebe.
- What? Witches aren't the only people

08:10.486 --> 08:13.322
that can see ghosts.
Normal people can too.

08:13.489 --> 08:17.201
<i>Anyway, I did some research,
and I found out that some evil spirits</i>

08:17.410 --> 08:20.037
need a dead body to transport them
across water.

08:20.454 --> 08:23.708
Okay, look, I'm really sorry that
the furnace exploded,

08:23.874 --> 08:26.085
but you're gonna have to handle it
on your own, okay?

08:26.293 --> 08:28.254
Okay, but if this ghost is on
the mainland...

08:28.462 --> 08:30.589
Don't forget to buy tampons
at the market.

08:30.798 --> 08:32.633
Hello?

08:32.967 --> 08:34.927
Just:

08:35.970 --> 08:38.889
Singed eyebrows.

08:44.520 --> 08:47.147
You take some of the old case files
home with you by any chance?

08:47.314 --> 08:49.275
No. Why?

08:49.441 --> 08:51.193
Missing a couple.

08:51.360 --> 08:54.113
Hope the captain's
not reviewing them.

08:55.030 --> 08:57.241
You wanna talk about it?

08:59.535 --> 09:01.495
Talk about what?

09:01.704 --> 09:04.289
About why you've been walking
around here like a zombie lately.

09:04.456 --> 09:06.417
Like ever since you ran into
Prue again.

09:07.876 --> 09:09.628
Come on, what's up?

09:10.337 --> 09:11.922
I wish I could tell you.
I really do.

09:12.923 --> 09:15.133
I just have to work things out
on my own first.

09:15.342 --> 09:21.223
Okay, you guys are the experts on
the freaky cases. Figure this one out.

09:21.557 --> 09:25.644
Victim was stabbed 13 times
in the chest, circular pattern.

09:25.852 --> 09:28.981
CSI combed the scene and, other than
the knife, found no evidence.

09:29.147 --> 09:31.817
Except, check this out.

09:32.943 --> 09:34.152
Solid thumbprint.

09:34.319 --> 09:36.321
Yeah, but we didn't get it
from dusting.

09:36.530 --> 09:39.533
- We got it from fluoroscoping.
- Ultraviolet fingerprint.

09:39.699 --> 09:41.993
- Never heard of that.
- We ran the print.

09:42.202 --> 09:45.580
This is where it gets freaky.
It matches up to Jackson Ward,

09:45.747 --> 09:49.501
the serial killer that was executed
at Alcatraz 36 years ago.

09:49.918 --> 09:53.004
- You sure about this?
- Checked it twice.

09:53.213 --> 09:56.800
Dead guy's prints on a murder
weapon. It's gotta be a mistake.

09:57.926 --> 09:59.970
Can I borrow this?

10:00.136 --> 10:02.722
Whoa, where are you going?

10:05.225 --> 10:07.519
Phoebe, I'm home.

10:14.067 --> 10:16.277
Phoebe.

10:16.861 --> 10:18.780
Phoebe, you didn't go
to the market yet?

10:18.947 --> 10:22.283
Oh, no. I sort of got sidetracked
with this ghost research.

10:22.450 --> 10:24.828
Besides, there isn't enough money
in the household account.

10:25.286 --> 10:27.747
You should've told me.
I would've had some transferred in.

10:27.914 --> 10:31.668
- What about the dry cleaning?
- I will go tomorrow, I swear.

10:31.876 --> 10:33.920
I wanted to wear that suit
to work tomorrow.

10:34.629 --> 10:38.675
Look, I know that I promised, but this
just sort of seemed more important.

10:42.971 --> 10:45.515
We're not gonna get into
a fight already, are we?

10:45.682 --> 10:48.101
I mean, I wouldn't wanna
prove Piper right.

10:56.776 --> 10:59.278
- Andy, hi.
- Hi.

11:01.155 --> 11:04.242
I was wondering if I'd see you again.
I thought maybe you were mad at me.

11:04.784 --> 11:08.287
No, I just needed some space.

11:08.496 --> 11:10.540
It's one thing to suspect
what your secret was.

11:10.706 --> 11:13.251
It's another thing to actually see it
with my own eyes.

11:13.417 --> 11:15.878
So does that mean that maybe
you're okay with it?

11:17.004 --> 11:20.883
Actually, I'm here on a case.
The kind of case where, frankly,

11:21.092 --> 11:25.554
before, I'd probably be looking for
a more logical explanation.

11:25.721 --> 11:27.431
Well, come on in.

11:30.559 --> 11:33.104
So, what's the case?

11:33.771 --> 11:36.440
The son of a former DA
was brutally murdered.

11:36.649 --> 11:38.442
The only quote-unquote
"evidence" points

11:38.609 --> 11:40.444
to the last man executed
on Alcatraz

11:40.653 --> 11:43.614
- before it was closed down.
- Jackson Ward.

11:44.698 --> 11:46.909
- How'd you know that?
- Yeah, how did you know that?

11:47.117 --> 11:48.994
I told you, I was trying to figure out

11:49.161 --> 11:51.080
who the ghost of Alcatraz was,
remember?

11:51.247 --> 11:53.457
Jackson Ward's name
was at the top of the list.

11:53.624 --> 11:56.961
- Ghost?
- Yeah. Hey, what's that?

11:57.169 --> 12:00.631
Ultraviolet fingerprint. Although,
technically, there's no such thing.

12:01.173 --> 12:05.260
Could be the ghost's ectoplasm.
It's outside the visual spectrum.

12:05.803 --> 12:08.597
<i>- Book of Shadows.
- Ectoplasm.</i>

12:08.806 --> 12:13.936
Yeah, it's the ghost's skin. Hey, do you
have a picture of this Ward guy?

12:16.271 --> 12:18.524
Yep, that's him.

12:19.900 --> 12:23.362
Exactly how Marianne described
him to me.

12:23.529 --> 12:25.447
- Amazing.
- Very.

12:25.656 --> 12:28.909
And what about this former DA's son?
Did Ward know him?

12:29.076 --> 12:31.411
Ward knew his father.

12:32.120 --> 12:34.665
He was the prosecutor
who convicted him.

12:35.123 --> 12:37.501
Coincidence? I think not.

12:38.293 --> 12:40.128
It's gotta be the ghost who
got off Alcatraz.

12:40.337 --> 12:42.881
You know, speaking of coincidences,
don't you think

12:43.090 --> 12:45.342
it's an awfully big one that your friend
saw this ghost?

12:45.509 --> 12:47.219
Prue, if we've learned
anything by now,

12:47.385 --> 12:51.181
- it's there are no coincidences, right?
- Right.

12:51.389 --> 12:52.891
Right.

12:53.892 --> 12:56.061
Andy, are you okay?

12:56.686 --> 13:01.358
I don't know. I'm just getting used to
the idea of demons and witches.

13:01.525 --> 13:03.526
I don't know if I'm ready for ghosts too.

13:03.735 --> 13:06.488
- You ain't seen nothing yet.
- Pheebs.

13:06.655 --> 13:09.366
If you're right, if it is the ghost
of Ward who's the killer,

13:09.950 --> 13:12.744
how do I stop him from
killing again?

13:33.723 --> 13:36.309
Judge Renault.

13:37.769 --> 13:40.396
Long time no see.

13:42.815 --> 13:48.363
You could've shown some mercy,
given me life in prison,

13:48.529 --> 13:50.531
but you wanted me put to death.

14:03.503 --> 14:05.630
What's going on?

14:08.216 --> 14:10.301
Who's there?

14:12.220 --> 14:16.015
Do you have any idea how long
it takes to die in a gas chamber?

14:16.182 --> 14:22.021
How much you suffer, what a cruel
and horrible death it is?

14:30.071 --> 14:32.323
No.

14:41.832 --> 14:44.001
I helped you get your revenge.

14:45.544 --> 14:47.421
Now it's your turn to help me
get a witch.

14:47.880 --> 14:52.218
Are you kidding, lady?
I'm just getting started.

15:04.313 --> 15:07.024
Thirteen stab wounds, circular pattern,
just like the other victim.

15:07.191 --> 15:08.984
Matches Jackson Ward's M.O. too.

15:09.193 --> 15:11.653
Must be a copycat killer.

15:12.279 --> 15:15.365
How would he know? The M.O.
Was never released to the public.

15:16.825 --> 15:18.243
Can I see that?

15:18.452 --> 15:21.121
Already dusted for prints. Nothing.

15:21.580 --> 15:23.499
- Did you fluoroscope it?
- What?

15:33.634 --> 15:35.761
- What the hell is that?
- Don't ask.

15:38.138 --> 15:40.057
Ten bucks says it matches Ward's.

15:40.265 --> 15:43.560
Andy, don't go jumping off
the deep end on me, okay?

15:43.727 --> 15:46.938
Jackson Ward is dead,
been that way for a long time now.

15:47.105 --> 15:49.691
Well, somebody's going around
killing people, or the descendants

15:49.858 --> 15:53.278
- of people who put him away.
- Where are you going?

15:54.321 --> 15:57.949
Look, have someone put together
a list of potential victims.

15:58.116 --> 16:00.285
Anybody who had anything to do
with his conviction.

16:00.452 --> 16:02.954
Andy, wait. Wait.

16:10.795 --> 16:15.383
I'm sure Prue will be here shortly.
She has a lot of...

16:15.550 --> 16:17.594
...family emergencies.

16:18.845 --> 16:21.181
- Claire, I am so sorry.
- Let me introduce you.

16:21.348 --> 16:23.641
This is Mr Yakihama,
head of Acquisitions.

16:23.850 --> 16:27.312
Mr Yakihama, this is Prue Halliwell,
one of our top specialists.

16:27.479 --> 16:30.523
- Hi, nice to meet you, sir.
- Nice to meet you too.

16:30.690 --> 16:33.777
I trust everything's all right
with your family?

16:35.278 --> 16:37.655
- Excuse me, Prue.
- Not now, Monique.

16:39.115 --> 16:41.326
- May I help you?
- Yeah, I need to see Ms Halliwell.

16:41.493 --> 16:43.077
It's police business.

16:45.413 --> 16:47.498
Excuse me.

16:47.916 --> 16:50.627
Are you trying to get me fired?

16:51.169 --> 16:54.589
I think Jackson Ward
has killed again, Prue.

16:54.922 --> 16:58.801
Great. That's great. Why don't you
just wait here a second.

16:58.968 --> 17:02.513
I'll take care of everything. Hi.

17:12.106 --> 17:15.859
- Phoebe?
- Yeah, I'm up in the attic.

17:19.571 --> 17:22.992
<i>- I always wondered what was up here.
- Prue. The Book...</i>

17:23.659 --> 17:27.038
No, it's okay. I already told him about it.
Look, Jackson Ward has killed again.

17:27.246 --> 17:29.957
We have to figure out a way to stop
him. Have you found anything?

17:30.124 --> 17:32.543
Not really. I mean, there's
just so many references in here.

17:32.710 --> 17:36.005
There's ghosts, poltergeists,
evil spirits, phantasms.

17:36.172 --> 17:39.216
We are not dealing with
a typical demon.

17:39.383 --> 17:44.430
Yeah, well, there has to be something
in here about vanquishing an evil spirit.

17:44.597 --> 17:47.558
Well, actually, there is one spell,

17:47.725 --> 17:49.560
but I don't think we're gonna
wanna use it.

17:49.769 --> 17:51.353
Why not?
If it needs the power of three,

17:51.520 --> 17:52.855
we can always call Piper, right?

17:53.022 --> 17:54.398
No, that's not the problem.

17:54.565 --> 17:57.860
The problem is an evil spirit can't be
vanquished on the physical plane,

17:58.068 --> 18:00.529
only the astral plane. His plane.

18:00.696 --> 18:02.323
Okay, so then how do we
say the spell?

18:02.990 --> 18:05.826
Well, our spirits would have to say it.

18:07.202 --> 18:09.997
Meaning one of us would have
to die for it to actually work.

18:10.998 --> 18:13.417
- Keep looking.
- Right.

18:16.837 --> 18:20.716
I've always believed there was another
world behind or beyond this one.

18:20.883 --> 18:27.473
I even sort of believe in demons, but I
have never in my wildest dreams...

18:27.639 --> 18:30.184
I could never have imagined
that this existed.

18:30.893 --> 18:33.270
Yeah, neither did we.

18:33.437 --> 18:35.856
But we've come to believe

18:36.023 --> 18:39.610
that there's a reason for why that world
was opened up to us.

18:39.776 --> 18:42.154
Which means there's probably
a very good reason

18:42.321 --> 18:43.780
why it was opened up to you too.

18:43.989 --> 18:47.326
Welcome to our little shop
of horrors.

18:49.494 --> 18:52.247
- Are you doing that?
- No, it just sometimes does it on its...

18:54.082 --> 18:57.794
...own.
- "The Truth Spell"?

18:58.003 --> 19:02.507
It's weird that it would open up to that
page with Andy standing right here.

19:02.674 --> 19:06.803
Okay, you know what,
it has to be a mistake, Phoebe.

19:07.012 --> 19:11.725
Or maybe there's a reason, Prue.

19:16.062 --> 19:18.648
- You did what last year?
- Look, I just wanted to see

19:18.815 --> 19:20.942
how you would react to finding out
I was a witch.

19:21.109 --> 19:23.570
So you cast a truth spell on me?
Why didn't you just ask?

19:23.737 --> 19:25.905
Oh, because I was afraid you'd
freak out on me.

19:26.281 --> 19:28.199
Which is exactly what you did,
by the way.

19:28.366 --> 19:30.577
You just don't remember.
Part of the spell.

19:30.785 --> 19:33.288
Wait a minute.
My reaction to your being a witch

19:33.455 --> 19:35.623
isn't the reason we stopped seeing
each other, is it?

19:35.790 --> 19:37.333
You wanted to stop seeing me first.

19:37.625 --> 19:39.544
Because you wouldn't say what
your secret was.

19:39.752 --> 19:42.797
Yeah, which turned out to be a good
thing, considering how you reacted.

19:43.006 --> 19:45.425
- Freaked out.
- Kind of like what you're doing now.

19:45.633 --> 19:47.010
You haven't answered my question.

19:47.177 --> 19:49.929
Did that have anything to do with why
we stopped seeing each other?

19:50.096 --> 19:51.764
Sort of.

19:52.891 --> 19:55.852
- Okay, yeah, it did.
- And just out of curiosity,

19:56.019 --> 19:58.021
how much time did you give me
to react anyway?

19:58.229 --> 20:00.606
- Why, what difference does it make?
- How much time?

20:00.815 --> 20:03.192
A minute... or two.

20:03.401 --> 20:04.986
- A minute?
- Or two.

20:05.153 --> 20:08.239
It was a 24-hour spell, all right?
I was against the clock.

20:08.448 --> 20:10.658
That's what you based your entire
decision about us on?

20:10.825 --> 20:13.745
I've had a week to react to it this time.
I still don't know how I feel.

20:13.911 --> 20:15.288
You should've given me more time.

20:15.455 --> 20:17.206
I think I deserved that.
We deserved that.

20:18.249 --> 20:20.918
Hey, you guys, since we don't know
how to vanquish the ghost,

20:21.169 --> 20:25.256
we have to try to stop him
from killing his next...

20:25.840 --> 20:28.175
...victim.
Am I interrupting something?

20:28.342 --> 20:30.344
No, we're done.

20:30.845 --> 20:33.097
What do you mean, stop him from
killing his next victim?

20:33.264 --> 20:36.851
- How do we do that?
- I have a power too, you know.

20:50.030 --> 20:51.449
Excuse me.

20:51.615 --> 20:53.284
Inspector Andrew Trudeau.

20:53.451 --> 20:57.455
I need the murder weapon
for case R-13658.

20:57.997 --> 20:59.707
Sign that. I'll go get it.

21:17.141 --> 21:19.143
Thanks.

21:28.026 --> 21:31.530
Yeah, you told me to call
if Trudeau showed.

21:31.738 --> 21:33.740
Yeah.

21:33.907 --> 21:35.242
He just left.

21:39.746 --> 21:41.957
Did you get that list of potential
victims yet?

21:42.124 --> 21:44.209
Still working on it.
It's a lot of names,

21:44.376 --> 21:47.087
especially when you add
in the descendants.

21:47.254 --> 21:50.340
- Where you been?
- You don't wanna know.

21:50.507 --> 21:53.468
Really? Try me.

21:53.927 --> 21:55.512
Maybe later, okay? Look, I gotta go.

21:55.679 --> 21:58.724
I'll take what you've got so far,
check back with you later.

21:59.307 --> 22:02.561
We're partners, Andy.
That means we work together.

22:02.769 --> 22:07.190
I know. But this is an exception.

22:09.568 --> 22:11.570
Inspector Morris?

22:11.903 --> 22:14.739
Inspector Rodriguez and Anderson,
Internal Affairs.

22:14.906 --> 22:17.826
We need to talk to you about
your partner.

22:22.789 --> 22:25.000
Okay, I got it.

22:25.417 --> 22:28.128
That's what Ward used
to kill the judge.

22:28.336 --> 22:30.171
How exactly is this gonna
work again?

22:30.338 --> 22:32.132
Well, I've been practicing calling
my power,

22:32.298 --> 22:34.718
and if the psychic energy is strong
enough on this,

22:34.884 --> 22:36.928
I should be able to see
a future event.

22:37.095 --> 22:39.305
Hopefully, Jackson Ward's next victim.

22:39.514 --> 22:43.143
If we're lucky.
It doesn't always work.

22:51.693 --> 22:53.778
Oh, my God.

22:53.987 --> 22:55.446
Are you all right?

22:55.613 --> 23:00.535
I didn't just see it, Prue, I felt it.

23:00.702 --> 23:03.454
Her pain, her terror.

23:04.414 --> 23:07.166
Any one of these look familiar?

23:19.554 --> 23:22.306
Iris Beiderman.

23:22.473 --> 23:25.935
The foreperson on the jury
that convicted him.

23:39.907 --> 23:42.827
- You again.
- "You again"? You two have met?

23:43.035 --> 23:44.537
Knife!

23:44.745 --> 23:48.207
- Where is he? Is he still here?
- Yeah, he's right there.

23:48.916 --> 23:50.751
Point him out, Prue.

23:50.918 --> 23:52.920
You can't keep saving her forever.

23:53.129 --> 23:56.465
- Prue, what's going on?
- Or the others.

23:57.174 --> 23:59.844
Or yourselves.

24:00.636 --> 24:01.929
Prue.

24:16.026 --> 24:17.486
I cannot believe you lied to me.

24:17.653 --> 24:20.656
And I cannot believe I had to hear
about it from a ghost.

24:20.823 --> 24:22.992
I already apologized for that, okay?

24:23.158 --> 24:25.202
I don't understand why you
couldn't tell the truth.

24:25.369 --> 24:28.205
Especially about something as stupid
as going to Alcatraz.

24:28.414 --> 24:31.500
I didn't tell you the truth
because I knew you'd go ballistic,

24:31.667 --> 24:34.044
and I thought that I would save
myself the drama.

24:34.211 --> 24:36.171
Why would I go ballistic over that?

24:36.338 --> 24:38.715
Come on, Prue, give me a break.
Just admit it.

24:38.924 --> 24:41.969
- Why are you really mad at me?
- Because you lied to me.

24:42.177 --> 24:44.763
No, you're really mad at me because,
as far as you're concerned,

24:44.930 --> 24:48.517
I was slacking off yesterday, which is
pretty much what I do every day, right?

24:48.684 --> 24:50.018
Where is this coming from?

24:50.227 --> 24:52.271
From the fact that I know that you're
really pissed

24:52.437 --> 24:55.274
because I didn't do the grocery
shopping or pick up your dry cleaning

24:55.440 --> 24:57.484
or whatever else you put
on that stupid list.

24:57.651 --> 25:00.028
I am sorry that I ask you to do things
around the house

25:00.195 --> 25:02.572
because I have to work.

25:02.739 --> 25:04.574
See? Time it, ladies and gentlemen.

25:04.741 --> 25:08.954
It took a whole 60 seconds before
the W-word reared its ugly head.

25:09.121 --> 25:11.873
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about how you and Piper

25:12.040 --> 25:14.417
just automatically assume that I'll take
care of the house

25:14.626 --> 25:16.920
- because I don't have a real job.
- That is not true.

25:17.129 --> 25:20.924
Oh, no? Prue, when was the last time
you went grocery shopping

25:21.132 --> 25:25.011
or vacuumed the house or waited all
day for the cable guy to show up?

25:25.178 --> 25:29.766
Which, by the way, if I were paid by
the hour, I'd be a millionaire by now.

25:29.975 --> 25:32.269
I cannot believe how you're turning
this around.

25:32.435 --> 25:34.562
And I cannot believe
how you're pretending

25:34.729 --> 25:37.190
- that you don't have a problem.
- I don't.

25:37.399 --> 25:41.820
Okay, well, you know what? You just
proved my point, my other point,

25:41.986 --> 25:46.074
which is I get absolutely no credit
for all that I do around here.

25:46.282 --> 25:48.034
It's just assumed that I'll do it.

25:48.243 --> 25:51.538
Like that crack that you made
to Piper yesterday morning.

25:51.704 --> 25:54.457
"Don't worry, Piper, Phoebe will do it.
She's got time."

25:54.666 --> 25:57.877
- You do.
- Yes, and that is exactly my point.

25:58.044 --> 25:59.879
My main point.

26:00.046 --> 26:04.551
You're mad at me
because I don't work.

26:08.096 --> 26:10.390
Okay, maybe you're right.

26:11.766 --> 26:14.519
And that's why I lied to you.

26:18.898 --> 26:21.317
- Hello.
- Hey, Phoebe. How's it going?

26:21.526 --> 26:23.694
Hey, Piper, how's Hawaii?

26:23.861 --> 26:26.823
I don't know. I haven't stopped working
since I got off the plane.

26:27.031 --> 26:29.033
<i>- Sure, rub it in.
- Excuse me?</i>

26:29.200 --> 26:30.952
Nothing. Hey, can I call you back?

26:31.160 --> 26:33.079
I'm in the middle of something
right now.

26:33.287 --> 26:36.290
Sure. I just wanted to make sure
you guys were all right.

26:36.457 --> 26:37.792
- Here you go.
- Do you miss me?

26:38.000 --> 26:40.294
<i>- More than you know, sweetie.
- Good. I love you.</i>

26:40.461 --> 26:43.172
<i>- We love you too. Bye.
- Bye.</i>

26:48.135 --> 26:49.845
Why didn't you tell her
about Jackson Ward?

26:50.054 --> 26:55.851
Why worry her? The power of three
can't vanquish him. It's up to us.

26:57.645 --> 27:01.440
Look, Phoebe, obviously, we have
some issues to deal with,

27:01.607 --> 27:04.318
but they're not gonna be
resolved overnight.

27:05.194 --> 27:07.947
So in the meantime, we need to figure
out a way to stop Jackson Ward

27:08.114 --> 27:11.116
before he hurts any more innocent
people, okay?

27:11.951 --> 27:13.786
I agree.

27:13.953 --> 27:19.959
Okay. So did we actually just reach
a compromise?

27:26.924 --> 27:29.051
- Wait a sec.
- You got it.

27:31.011 --> 27:33.222
We're gonna put you up in a hotel
for a little while,

27:33.430 --> 27:36.975
under police protection, at least until
we catch whoever's trying to hurt you.

27:37.142 --> 27:39.436
Okay?

27:40.229 --> 27:41.730
Okay.

27:44.900 --> 27:49.238
I'm not crazy, am I?
You saw it too, didn't you?

27:49.404 --> 27:51.907
Yeah, I did.

27:52.074 --> 27:55.536
But let's just keep it our little secret
for now, okay?

28:08.840 --> 28:10.717
- Who was that?
- Someone who got attacked.

28:10.926 --> 28:15.305
Attacked? By who? Why?

28:15.764 --> 28:20.102
Iris Beiderman, the jury foreperson
who helped convict Ward.

28:20.310 --> 28:21.853
Now, how about that?

28:22.020 --> 28:24.022
- Look, Morris...
- Don't "Look, Morris" me, man.

28:24.189 --> 28:26.608
You go flying out of here with that file,
you just come back

28:26.775 --> 28:30.111
with somebody in that file who just
happened to have been attacked.

28:30.737 --> 28:32.656
Wanna tell me what's going on?

28:32.822 --> 28:36.660
I told you, I can't, okay? I'm sorry.

28:36.826 --> 28:40.413
Fine, whatever. It's your funeral.

28:40.914 --> 28:43.500
What's that supposed to mean?

28:43.667 --> 28:45.251
They told me not to
say anything to you.

28:45.418 --> 28:48.171
- Who did?
- Internal Affairs.

28:48.338 --> 28:50.215
They got you in their cross hairs.

28:50.423 --> 28:53.635
Interviewed me for over two hours.
Wouldn't tell me what it was about.

28:53.843 --> 28:57.097
Asked a lot of questions about you.

28:58.723 --> 29:01.559
Watch your back, bro.

29:04.187 --> 29:06.648
Well, it's the same story.
One of us has to literally die

29:06.814 --> 29:09.609
in order to vanquish
the evil spirit.

29:10.068 --> 29:12.278
- Any volunteers?
- Actually, maybe.

29:12.445 --> 29:16.032
But before that, we need to figure out
a way to find Ward first.

29:16.199 --> 29:18.117
We can't count on your seeing
his next victim,

29:18.284 --> 29:21.287
even though Andy left us the
letter opener to try.

29:21.454 --> 29:23.831
Wait a minute. I think that there's
something in here

29:23.998 --> 29:25.958
about luring evil spirits.

29:26.376 --> 29:28.294
A potion.

29:29.754 --> 29:31.547
"To lure an evil spirit.

29:31.714 --> 29:34.175
Mix equal parts of mercury and acid
with the blood

29:34.342 --> 29:37.929
of one of the spirit's victims,
then pour it over his grave."

29:38.095 --> 29:39.514
Okay, that's disgusting.

29:39.680 --> 29:41.682
We can get the blood
from the letter opener,

29:41.849 --> 29:43.726
but how are we gonna find
Ward's grave?

29:43.893 --> 29:45.686
You know what? I read on the Web:

29:45.853 --> 29:49.690
"His ashes were interred at his family
mausoleum in Palo Alto."

29:49.857 --> 29:51.984
Great, it just might work.

29:52.151 --> 29:57.573
Yeah, but if it does work,
he'll be coming after us.

30:06.082 --> 30:07.708
I hate cemeteries at night.

30:07.875 --> 30:12.046
I hate cemeteries at day.
What was that?

30:13.422 --> 30:15.466
Probably a zombie or a vampire.

30:15.633 --> 30:18.761
Great, where's Buffy when you
need her?

30:18.928 --> 30:21.722
Okay, perfect. There it is.
"Jackson Ward."

30:21.931 --> 30:24.558
Do you have the picture?

30:27.102 --> 30:29.021
"Hey, Jackson, let's party"?

30:29.188 --> 30:32.733
Okay, well, I couldn't think
of anything else to write.

30:33.150 --> 30:36.862
- Could we just do this and hurry?
- Okay.

30:43.660 --> 30:46.246
- Okay. All right, let's go.
- Yeah, let's go.

31:13.357 --> 31:17.527
- What's happening?
- Witchcraft. Sucks, doesn't it?

31:19.071 --> 31:21.656
You should've helped me get
to them before, when I asked.

31:21.823 --> 31:25.118
- How do I get them now?
- Visit your grave.

32:03.239 --> 32:05.700
<i>Hi, we're not home.
You know the drill.</i>

32:05.867 --> 32:08.495
Prue, it's Andy.
I gotta give you something.

32:08.661 --> 32:12.123
Gotta get it out of here.
I'll explain when I get there.

32:12.332 --> 32:17.545
Inspector Trudeau? Internal Affairs.
Let's talk.

32:25.553 --> 32:27.972
Series of women murdered
with an occult knife.

32:28.139 --> 32:31.893
Prime suspect missing.

32:32.226 --> 32:34.979
Series of victims with curious holes
burned into their foreheads.

32:35.146 --> 32:37.857
Prime suspect missing.

32:38.566 --> 32:42.612
Victims found in a locked room with
every bone in their bodies broken.

32:42.778 --> 32:46.824
Victims literally scared to death.
The list goes on and on.

32:46.991 --> 32:49.493
You know what they all have
in common?

32:49.660 --> 32:52.663
- We've been through this already.
- They're all unsolved cases, Trudeau.

32:52.830 --> 32:57.209
- And they're all yours and Morris'.
- We've solved plenty of other cases.

32:57.418 --> 32:58.919
But you haven't solved these.

32:59.128 --> 33:01.422
So the question is why?

33:04.592 --> 33:08.346
- What are you hiding?
- I'm not hiding anything.

33:20.274 --> 33:21.775
You guys spy on your wives too?

33:21.984 --> 33:23.611
Why did you check the murder
weapon out?

33:23.819 --> 33:25.571
- I was following a hunch.
- Really?

33:25.738 --> 33:29.408
Or were you following a ghost?
Word's out, Trudeau.

33:29.867 --> 33:33.704
You specialize in the...
What did Inspector Blakely call it?

33:33.913 --> 33:37.750
- The freaky cases.
- The freaky cases.

33:38.500 --> 33:41.295
You're a good cop.
I've seen your jacket.

33:41.462 --> 33:43.672
Up until last year, you were headed
for captain.

33:43.881 --> 33:47.634
Now you've got all these weird,
unsolved cases.

33:48.260 --> 33:52.431
What happened to you, man?
What changed?

33:53.265 --> 33:57.352
Are you covering for somebody?
Is that it? Morris, maybe?

33:57.978 --> 34:01.857
- Don't hang this on Morris.
- Then who do we hang it on?

34:03.567 --> 34:05.777
Look, I told you my story.
You don't believe me,

34:05.986 --> 34:08.906
you take my hardware right now
and you charge me.

34:12.326 --> 34:16.163
Otherwise, drop dead.

34:28.007 --> 34:30.510
Maybe it didn't work.
Maybe he's not coming.

34:30.677 --> 34:34.014
Well, at least if he is coming,
we are definitely ready for him.

34:34.181 --> 34:39.101
- What exactly is that?
- One killer cocktail, literally.

34:39.268 --> 34:41.228
A little bit of oleander,
some jimsonweed,

34:41.396 --> 34:44.774
bloodroot, among other things.
Stops the heart immediately.

34:44.983 --> 34:47.860
Okay, you're scaring me.
Where did you learn to do that?

34:48.027 --> 34:51.947
<i>- The Book of Shadows.
- Where, under "Dr Kevorkian"?</i>

34:52.114 --> 34:53.867
Whoever takes it
can be revived with CPR.

34:54.034 --> 34:55.744
The only catch is it has to be done

34:55.909 --> 34:57.996
within four minutes to avoid
brain damage.

34:58.163 --> 35:00.206
Okay, Prue, that's a pretty big catch.

35:00.373 --> 35:03.043
Yeah, well,
it's the only way to say the spell.

35:03.209 --> 35:06.629
It's the only chance that we have of
sending Ward where he belongs.

35:06.796 --> 35:10.550
But who does it?
How do we decide that?

35:10.717 --> 35:12.302
I'll do it.

35:12.469 --> 35:14.846
No.

35:18.224 --> 35:22.395
Call it. Heads or tails.
And no fair, using your power.

35:22.604 --> 35:25.023
Tails.

35:27.191 --> 35:30.028
- I win.
- You mean you lose.

35:30.486 --> 35:35.366
- Oh, well, only if you don't revive me.
- No pressure.

35:36.868 --> 35:40.455
Phoebe, I have total confidence in you.

35:40.621 --> 35:45.626
I'm scared, Prue.
I mean, I'm really scared.

35:45.793 --> 35:49.630
- I think we've gone too far this time.
- We're doing what we have to do.

35:49.839 --> 35:52.216
I wish Piper were here.

35:52.383 --> 35:56.971
The swing vote,
the voice of reason.

35:57.138 --> 36:00.975
Look, Phoebe, I never realized
how much I probably

36:01.142 --> 36:03.060
do take you for granted, and not just

36:03.227 --> 36:05.354
for what you do
around the house, either.

36:05.521 --> 36:10.234
Sure. You're just saying that because
you're about to die.

36:10.401 --> 36:14.488
No. You were right about last night.
I was upset because I thought

36:14.655 --> 36:17.450
that you were slacking off.
But the truth is, you weren't.

36:17.616 --> 36:21.078
You were trying to find out who
the ghost was, and thank God you did.

36:21.287 --> 36:24.123
Yeah, but I totally overreacted.
I'm the one that's upset with myself

36:24.290 --> 36:26.417
- for not working for a living.
- You do work.

36:27.042 --> 36:32.256
I know, Prue. I work around the house.
But I want a job. I want a real job.

36:32.423 --> 36:36.218
And you will find one,
when you're ready.

36:38.178 --> 36:41.557
I can't remember the last time
we talked like this.

36:46.895 --> 36:50.190
<i>Hi, we're not home.
You know the drill.</i>

36:52.151 --> 36:56.447
<i>Prue, it's Claire. You're late.
You're fired.</i>

36:57.072 --> 36:58.490
Phoebe, duck!

37:00.826 --> 37:03.871
Okay, Prue, I got him.
You just hurry!

37:20.929 --> 37:23.890
You're making this too easy, lady.

37:35.569 --> 37:38.321
What the hell's going on?

37:38.488 --> 37:43.160
<i>Ashes to ashes, spirit to spirit
Take his soul, banish this evil</i>

37:45.954 --> 37:47.664
No!

37:47.831 --> 37:50.292
Prue, are you home?

37:56.381 --> 38:00.552
<i>Ashes to ashes, spirit to spirit
Take his soul, banish this evil</i>

38:00.760 --> 38:03.179
Prue?

38:06.766 --> 38:08.101
Prue.

38:08.309 --> 38:13.440
<i>Ashes to ashes, spirit to spirit
Take his soul, banish this evil</i>

38:13.648 --> 38:15.567
Prue.

38:19.237 --> 38:20.738
Come on.

38:22.532 --> 38:25.577
Andy, don't, not yet.

38:32.125 --> 38:34.252
This is even better.
Now I get to kill a cop too.

38:34.460 --> 38:37.130
Andy, behind you!

38:44.554 --> 38:49.559
<i>Ashes to ashes, spirit to spirit
Take his soul, banish this evil</i>

39:03.197 --> 39:05.074
- Who are you?
- I was hoping

39:05.241 --> 39:07.034
to take you or your sister.

39:07.201 --> 39:09.954
But it looks like your soul is safe.

39:10.663 --> 39:12.915
For now.

39:15.793 --> 39:18.254
Come on.

39:19.422 --> 39:22.091
Slow breaths.

39:27.721 --> 39:31.433
- Am I alive?
- Yeah, you are. Thank God.

39:35.479 --> 39:37.189
What happened?

39:37.356 --> 39:40.234
Is the ghost toast?

39:48.951 --> 39:51.787
I'm sorry, Prue,
but I've made up my mind.

39:51.954 --> 39:55.916
Claire, you cannot fire me, okay?
I love this job. I need this job.

39:56.125 --> 40:00.421
I told you I wouldn't tolerate any more
unexplained absences.

40:00.587 --> 40:02.965
Excuse me, Ms Pryce.
I'm sorry to interrupt.

40:03.132 --> 40:05.551
I just wanted to stop by
and say thank you.

40:05.717 --> 40:10.806
- Thank you, inspector? For what?
- For letting us borrow Ms Halliwell.

40:10.973 --> 40:14.184
See, an Asian gang was smuggling
exotic jewellery antiques.

40:14.351 --> 40:16.979
She helped us set up a sting,
bust their operation.

40:17.187 --> 40:21.316
Really? Prue never mentioned
any of this to me before.

40:21.483 --> 40:23.360
Well, she couldn't compromise
her cover.

40:23.568 --> 40:25.737
You're welcome to call my superior,
Inspector Morris,

40:25.904 --> 40:28.115
and file a reimbursement claim,
if you'd like.

40:28.281 --> 40:31.034
No, that won't be necessary.

40:31.201 --> 40:34.371
Soon as you're done here,
we need to talk.

40:34.538 --> 40:37.082
I think I'm more than done here.

40:38.291 --> 40:40.252
Oh, Prue.

40:40.710 --> 40:44.422
Don't forget about our lunch
with the investors.

40:44.631 --> 40:50.554
- Wouldn't want you to be late.
- I won't be. Thanks.

40:56.309 --> 40:59.271
- I cannot believe you did that.
- Least I could do.

40:59.437 --> 41:01.106
After all,
you did help us bust somebody.

41:01.273 --> 41:04.442
- Sure, he was already dead, but still...
- Well, thank you.

41:04.609 --> 41:06.695
You're welcome.

41:11.157 --> 41:17.705
Listen, Prue, I've done some thinking
about the truth spell,

41:17.872 --> 41:23.002
and I'm still kind of trying to sort
my feelings out.

41:23.169 --> 41:27.799
But I've kind of come to the conclusion
that no matter whether I had a minute,

41:27.966 --> 41:31.636
a month or a year to think about it,

41:33.972 --> 41:36.724
it wouldn't change the truth.

41:38.184 --> 41:42.563
It may sound boring, but I know that
someday I want to have a normal life

41:42.730 --> 41:48.945
to come home to. You know,
with a white picket fence,

41:49.112 --> 41:53.032
a two-car garage,
a screaming kid.

41:54.992 --> 41:58.162
But no demons.

42:00.665 --> 42:05.044
Maybe it's because of all the evil I deal
with every day on the job. I don't know.

42:05.211 --> 42:09.590
You don't have to explain.
I understand.

42:10.800 --> 42:13.844
Believe me, I wouldn't wanna come
home to it either, if I could avoid it,

42:14.011 --> 42:15.596
but I can't.

42:16.305 --> 42:17.765
You can.

42:36.492 --> 42:39.495
So did you burn Andy's file like
he suggested?

42:39.662 --> 42:41.705
Yeah, and you should've seen it.

42:41.872 --> 42:45.125
Turns out he knew a lot more about us
than he was letting on.

42:45.334 --> 42:47.670
Still doesn't explain how he could
hear a ghost.

42:48.128 --> 42:50.047
- What do you mean?
- When you were a spirit,

42:50.256 --> 42:51.548
you said you yelled out to him,

42:51.715 --> 42:53.676
and that's what made him
turn around in time.

42:53.842 --> 42:56.887
- How could he hear you?
- I don't know.

42:57.054 --> 42:58.889
- Hi.
- Piper.

42:59.056 --> 43:01.350
I thought you weren't coming
back till tomorrow.

43:01.517 --> 43:05.979
I took an earlier flight. I had this terrible
feeling that you guys were...

43:06.688 --> 43:08.232
What?

43:08.399 --> 43:11.777
Oh, I don't know,
at each other's throats, maybe.

43:11.944 --> 43:13.737
- Us?
- Are you kidding?

43:13.904 --> 43:15.489
Never.

43:15.656 --> 43:17.491
So nothing happened
while I was gone?

43:17.699 --> 43:20.744
Just, you know, the same old
boring stuff.

43:20.911 --> 43:23.163
- Hey, you need a hand?
- That would be great. Thanks.

43:23.330 --> 43:25.332
Sure.

43:25.499 --> 43:28.335
It's good to see you.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
