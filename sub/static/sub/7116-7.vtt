00:04.140 --> 00:06.500
Hey Cat! I've been looking all over for you.

00:06.500 --> 00:08.500
Where are you? Call me!

00:08.500 --> 00:10.500
Hey, have you guys seen Cat?

00:10.500 --> 00:12.500
Oh... you're head shaker!

00:12.980 --> 00:15.220
Hey! Have you seen Trina?

00:15.280 --> 00:17.710
No? Hey harp, have you seen Trina?

00:18.840 --> 00:20.390
- Hey have you seen Trina?
- Hey have you seen Cat?

00:20.390 --> 00:22.050
- Sorry. But I really want to find Trina...
- No. But I really want to find Cat...

00:22.050 --> 00:23.580
- Because she's spreading rumors about me...
- Because she...

00:23.580 --> 00:25.580
- Oh never mind. I'll find her.
- Oh never mind. I'll find her.

00:27.330 --> 00:30.440
Cat... Cat...

00:30.470 --> 00:31.770
'Sup.

00:31.810 --> 00:33.740
"Sup?!" Where have you been?!

00:33.780 --> 00:36.580
I've been trying to find you
since I woke up this morning!

00:36.610 --> 00:38.550
At least you woke up.

00:38.580 --> 00:40.480
Some people didn't.

00:40.520 --> 00:42.650
What do you mean?

00:42.680 --> 00:45.250
And why are you all sad?

00:45.290 --> 00:47.090
How do you know I'm sad?

00:47.120 --> 00:48.960
Well, you're dressed in sad colors,

00:48.990 --> 00:50.620
and you were playing a sad song,

00:50.660 --> 00:55.800
oh and you're wearing a button
that says, "I'm sad, ask me why."

00:55.830 --> 00:58.800
Mona Patterson died.

00:58.840 --> 01:02.170
Oh. I'm so sorry...

01:02.210 --> 01:05.010
But I don't know who Mona Patterson is.

01:05.010 --> 01:06.610
That's what's so sad!

01:06.640 --> 01:08.380
She's one of my favorite actresses ever.

01:08.410 --> 01:11.450
She was on a really popular tv
show from the nineteen sixties.

01:11.480 --> 01:14.380
- What show?
- I married my mom.

01:14.420 --> 01:16.680
Oh yeah, I liked that show.

01:16.720 --> 01:18.090
I used to watch reruns of it.

01:18.120 --> 01:20.090
With my brother when he was
in the special hospital.

01:20.120 --> 01:24.090
Where they used to handcuff him to his bed.

01:24.130 --> 01:28.130
But now no one even remembers Mona
Patterson or cares that she's gone.

01:28.160 --> 01:30.760
I'm sure she has lots of fans who care.

01:30.800 --> 01:31.530
No.

01:31.570 --> 01:34.470
On my way to school I stopped at
her star on Hollywood boulevard,

01:34.500 --> 01:36.740
and there weren't any flowers
or anything...

01:36.770 --> 01:41.370
Just a weird man with a hat
and some vomit on his pants.

01:41.410 --> 01:43.410
Yeah. Um listen...

01:43.450 --> 01:47.480
I gave him a tidy wipe but he ate it.

01:47.520 --> 01:49.280
Well, I'm sorry you're sad.

01:49.320 --> 01:51.220
But we have a science project due tomorrow.

01:51.250 --> 01:53.120
And we still have a lot to do.

01:53.160 --> 01:58.160
No, I'm too sad to science.

02:01.930 --> 02:04.570
Okay, where did Mona Patterson live?

02:04.600 --> 02:06.600
Here in California.

02:06.640 --> 02:08.070
All right, well...

02:08.110 --> 02:10.710
What if, after school,
we drive to her house,

02:10.740 --> 02:14.340
and you maybe... light a candle
and leave it by her doorstep,

02:14.380 --> 02:15.810
to honor her memory?

02:15.850 --> 02:17.710
Can it be a scented candle?

02:17.750 --> 02:18.780
Sure.

02:18.820 --> 02:21.380
'Cuz I have one
that smells like cinnamon buns.

02:21.420 --> 02:23.720
Did Mona Patterson like cinnamon buns?

02:23.750 --> 02:26.920
I dunno!
We weren't "friends".

02:26.960 --> 02:28.760
Okay, just...

02:28.790 --> 02:30.290
You find
Mrs. Patterson's address,

02:30.330 --> 02:33.290
and then, after school
we'll drive to her house,

02:33.330 --> 02:35.300
and then you can leave
your candle by her door,

02:35.330 --> 02:36.760
and then we'll go back to my house.

02:36.800 --> 02:39.000
And work on our science project
until we finish.

02:39.040 --> 02:42.470
- 'Kay?
- 'Kay. So you'll drive?

02:42.500 --> 02:46.410
No, I...
I didn't pass my driver's test.

02:46.440 --> 02:47.740
Why not?

02:47.780 --> 02:51.280
I didn't see the old lady
in the wheelchair.

02:51.310 --> 02:53.950
Well, I signaled before I hit her!

02:56.580 --> 02:58.020
- Jade...
- What?

02:58.050 --> 02:59.550
If my brother lets us borrow his car,

02:59.590 --> 03:02.220
will you drive Tori and me to an
old lady's house after school?

03:02.260 --> 03:05.320
- No.
- Wait, please?

03:05.360 --> 03:08.730
Cat's really sad because this actress
passed away last night and...

03:08.760 --> 03:11.200
Whoa?!
She passed away just last night?

03:11.230 --> 03:12.670
- Yeah.
- Then yeeeaaah.

03:12.700 --> 03:16.540
Yeah, I'll drive you guys to her house.

03:16.570 --> 03:18.240
Why'd you change your mind?

03:18.270 --> 03:20.480
- Because it's been less than
twenty-four hours...

03:20.510 --> 03:22.710
Which means her spirit
is still lingering...

03:22.750 --> 03:26.450
So I'll be able to breathe in
the fumes of her soul.

03:26.480 --> 03:29.180
- Maybe there's a bus we can take.
- No!

03:29.220 --> 03:30.550
No... I'll take you.

03:30.590 --> 03:32.090
We can leave after sundown.

03:32.120 --> 03:33.720
Why can't we just go after school?

03:33.760 --> 03:38.790
I don't like driving in the daylight.

03:38.830 --> 03:40.430
Hey, Trina...

03:40.460 --> 03:43.800
Hey pretty boy.
Lookin' for moi?

03:43.830 --> 03:45.370
Yeah.
Have you been goin' around.

03:45.400 --> 03:47.170
Telling anyone I asked you out?

03:47.200 --> 03:47.970
Noooo...

03:48.000 --> 03:51.170
No, I've been telling everyone
you asked me out.

03:51.210 --> 03:53.410
Why are you telling people I asked you out?

03:53.440 --> 03:55.810
'Cuz if people think
that you're interested in me,

03:55.840 --> 03:57.640
then other guys will wanna date me.

03:57.680 --> 04:01.610
And pretty soon
I'll have boys fighting over me.

04:01.650 --> 04:04.120
Okay, you're a maniac.

04:04.150 --> 04:09.160
Oh, yes!

04:11.220 --> 04:12.830
You bit my lip!

04:12.860 --> 04:16.260
I tried to bite both.

05:30.290 --> 05:31.590
So Cat...

05:31.620 --> 05:36.160
Is there some reason your brother
replaced this seatbelt with a rope?

05:36.200 --> 05:40.600
No, he just loves rope.

05:40.600 --> 05:42.130
What is that thing anyway?

05:42.170 --> 05:44.440
Oh, this is Cat's and my science project.

05:44.470 --> 05:46.600
It's a robot that's hamster powered.

05:46.640 --> 05:48.940
See, mister hamster runs on this wheel.

05:48.970 --> 05:51.310
And that creates
electro-magnetic electricity.

05:51.340 --> 05:56.710
Which flows through this transformer
and then powers the robot.

05:56.750 --> 05:58.010
Isn't it cool?

05:58.050 --> 06:04.960
I dunno, all I heard was "hamster hamster
science science Tori's boring kill me."

06:04.990 --> 06:08.330
- You want a muffin?
- Sure.

06:08.360 --> 06:11.100
- You brought muffins?
- Oh, no, I found it under the seat.

06:15.770 --> 06:19.340
- Not so boring now, am I?
- All right, Vega. I'm gonna pull over...

06:19.370 --> 06:21.340
You guys, I'm not gonna sit here.

06:21.380 --> 06:23.540
And listen to the two of you
fight for the next two hours.

06:23.580 --> 06:26.350
Well, she's the one who...
Two hours?!

06:26.380 --> 06:29.720
I thought we were just driving to some dead
actress's house and lighting a candle.

06:29.750 --> 06:35.290
We are.
Her house is in San Diego.

06:35.330 --> 06:39.990
- San Diego?!
- Caaaat... we gotta finish our science project before morning!

06:40.030 --> 06:40.560
But...

06:40.600 --> 06:47.570
- No! I am not driving this rolling
chiz-box to San Diego and back.

06:53.340 --> 07:00.050
- Just drive the child to San Diego.
- All right!

07:02.750 --> 07:06.520
Step one, two, three, and four.
Five, six, seven eight.

07:06.560 --> 07:10.420
Now one, two, three and four.
Five, six, seven, eight.

07:10.460 --> 07:15.460
And one, two...

07:17.660 --> 07:19.570
Okay.

07:19.600 --> 07:22.800
Most of you, that was awesome.

07:22.840 --> 07:27.840
Trina, you keep trying.

07:35.380 --> 07:38.320
- Beck...
- 'Sup Trina?

07:38.350 --> 07:41.760
- What are you here for?
- You.

07:41.790 --> 07:46.290
Me? I...
I don't understand...

07:46.330 --> 07:47.090
Ever since you kissed me.

07:47.130 --> 07:51.430
This morning... it's...
It's affected me.

07:51.470 --> 07:56.300
- W-well... I had a burrito for breakfast...
Was it the onions?

07:56.340 --> 08:00.670
- I like you.
- Whaaaaat?

08:00.710 --> 08:02.670
Can I come over to your house tonight?

08:02.710 --> 08:06.610
Yes, oh my God yes please.

08:06.650 --> 08:11.180
Oh... you...
You want me to make you some dinner?

08:11.220 --> 08:13.650
Yeah.
Will you make me a chicken?

08:13.690 --> 08:20.530
Yeah. Oh, yeah I'll
make you a chicken.

08:28.710 --> 08:31.610
C'mon, go hamster! Run!

08:31.640 --> 08:35.909
Make electricity, ya fuzzy little beast!

08:35.950 --> 08:37.650
Why won't he run faster?

08:37.679 --> 08:40.510
'Cuz you bought us a fat hamster.

08:40.549 --> 08:43.480
He reminded me of Santa claus.

08:43.520 --> 08:46.620
Oh my God, how much longer to San Diego?

08:46.660 --> 08:48.790
Oh, um I'll check my pear pad...

08:48.820 --> 08:50.090
Uh...

08:50.130 --> 08:51.990
According to this map,

08:52.030 --> 08:56.430
we should be there in about...
Sixty-three more miles.

08:56.470 --> 08:59.600
- Oh, good,
we're over half-way there.

08:59.640 --> 09:02.540
Hey, and the hamster's running faster.

09:02.570 --> 09:06.610
Yeah. C'mon fat Santa!

09:06.640 --> 09:09.310
I don't understand why we're
not getting any power to...

09:09.340 --> 09:12.510
Oh my gosh look!
Look look look look!

09:12.550 --> 09:15.350
Yay, we made electricity!
Go robot!

09:15.380 --> 09:17.890
He's aliiiiiveeee!!!
Wooooo!

09:17.920 --> 09:19.820
Weeeeee!

09:19.860 --> 09:22.420
Uh, ladies...

09:22.460 --> 09:23.760
I hate to rain on your parade,

09:23.790 --> 09:27.330
but I think it's raining on your parade.

09:27.360 --> 09:29.230
- Uh-oh.

09:29.270 --> 09:34.270
Yeah, it is raining.

09:35.570 --> 09:37.510
Hey Cat, I think I brought an umbrella.

09:37.540 --> 09:44.710
- Do you see it back there?
- No, not really.

09:56.560 --> 09:59.130
- Hey baby.
- I am furious.

09:59.160 --> 10:01.500
Aw, well...

10:01.530 --> 10:04.460
Yeah, you should call your mom.

10:04.500 --> 10:07.870
I put this stupid chicken
in the oven three hours ago.

10:07.900 --> 10:11.240
And it's still not cooked!

10:11.270 --> 10:13.870
Okay. Um...

10:13.910 --> 10:15.110
Couple a'things...

10:15.140 --> 10:16.510
Huh?

10:16.550 --> 10:21.550
You didn't turn the oven on...

10:21.580 --> 10:27.790
This is a Turkey...
And uh... yeah, it's frozen.

10:27.820 --> 10:30.620
Well what am I supposed to feed Beck?!

10:30.660 --> 10:31.930
- Does he like turkey-cicles?

10:31.960 --> 10:32.890
Daaaad...

10:32.930 --> 10:34.730
Look, I'm gonna go in the garage
and run on the treadmill.

10:34.760 --> 10:36.600
No, you've gotta help me cook the Turkey!

10:36.630 --> 10:38.630
I'm sorry, I can't hear you
over the music...

10:38.670 --> 10:43.600
Even though this isn't playing yet.

10:57.220 --> 10:59.750
Go on! Get in there!

10:59.790 --> 11:03.160
Be a good girl!
Get in the microwave!

11:03.190 --> 11:04.890
Errrrgggggg!!!

11:13.270 --> 11:15.540
We've gotta pull over!

11:15.570 --> 11:19.510
I can't pull over on this freeway,
there's no place to stop!

11:19.540 --> 11:23.080
I'm getting wet.

11:23.110 --> 11:24.910
How do we put up the top?!

11:24.950 --> 11:27.480
Cat, where's the switch to put the top up?

11:27.520 --> 11:34.560
- Right there under the radio.
- Oh, okay.

11:34.590 --> 11:41.160
- It's not working!
- I know, it's broken!

11:41.200 --> 11:48.440
- How long 'til the next exit?
- Ten more miles!

11:48.470 --> 11:52.370
Ah!

11:52.410 --> 11:53.680
What are we gonna do?

11:53.710 --> 11:59.480
...

11:59.520 --> 12:01.380
There, that's better.

12:01.420 --> 12:02.750
Ah!

12:02.790 --> 12:04.790
What?!

12:04.820 --> 12:06.390
You've got to be kidding me!

12:31.880 --> 12:34.920
- At least it stopped raining.
- For now.

12:34.950 --> 12:37.320
Well we have to get the top up on this car.

12:37.350 --> 12:38.890
In case it starts raining again.

12:38.920 --> 12:41.590
Yeah, I'd hate to get
all wet and disgusting.

12:41.620 --> 12:45.790
C'mon guys, let's just try
and pull up the top ourselves.

12:45.830 --> 12:48.190
- It's broken.
- We know that!

12:48.230 --> 12:50.060
Does your brother
have any tools in the car?

12:50.100 --> 12:56.530
- I think in the trunk.
- Open the trunk.

12:56.570 --> 12:59.670
- Ahhhhhh!
- Oh my God!

12:59.710 --> 13:03.840
What is this...

13:03.880 --> 13:06.310
Don't worry, they're not real feet.

13:06.350 --> 13:09.350
But why does your brother have a bag
of fake feet in the trunk of his car?!

13:09.380 --> 13:13.650
I'm not gonna lie,
my brother's pretty weird.

13:13.690 --> 13:20.190
Let's just see if we can get the top up.

13:22.390 --> 13:24.530
Errrrgggg...

13:24.560 --> 13:30.030
Help me...

13:30.070 --> 13:33.140
Okay okay, it's loose.

13:33.170 --> 13:38.180
Now let's pull up that top.

13:40.140 --> 13:41.210
What?

13:41.250 --> 13:44.350
Our car is "topless".

13:44.380 --> 13:46.850
Y'know,
let's just go back to L.A.

13:46.890 --> 13:48.450
- Yes.
- Nooooo!

13:48.490 --> 13:50.890
You guys promised we could go
to Mona Patterson's house.

13:50.920 --> 13:53.160
So I could light a candle
and leave it by her front door.

13:53.190 --> 13:55.460
- But Cat...
- Pleeeeeaaaaasse!

13:55.490 --> 13:56.690
C'mon!
It's already late.

13:56.730 --> 13:57.930
And we need to get back to L.A.

13:57.960 --> 13:59.530
So we can finish our science project...

13:59.570 --> 14:01.600
Tori... Tori...

14:01.630 --> 14:07.570
What...?

14:07.610 --> 14:11.370
Can I have a ride to your house?

14:11.410 --> 14:15.710
Um...
No, no... we're...

14:15.750 --> 14:19.280
We're driving our friend to San Diego.

14:19.320 --> 14:23.290
- When are you going
to san-die-ego?

14:23.320 --> 14:26.960
- Y'know... now!!!
- Ah!

14:26.990 --> 14:30.090
Get in the car!

14:30.130 --> 14:33.130
Go, go, go, go!

14:42.110 --> 14:43.810
Ahhh!

14:44.940 --> 14:49.950
Oh, uh... Beck's here!

14:59.330 --> 15:02.130
- Andre. Tori's not h...
- I'm not here to see Tori.

15:02.160 --> 15:05.500
- Well, I have a date tonight with...
- Beck. Yeah, I know.

15:05.530 --> 15:09.270
- I know what's goin' on.
- I don't understand...

15:09.300 --> 15:12.300
- Somethin' wrong with me?
- Uhh, no? Nothing's wrong with you...

15:12.340 --> 15:14.510
Why Beck? Huh?
Is Beck so fantastic?

15:14.540 --> 15:18.070
- Is Beck better than me?!
- I don't know what you mean.

15:18.110 --> 15:20.310
- I...
- Am I not handsome?

15:20.350 --> 15:24.250
Do I not have
a happy-go-skippy personality?!

15:24.280 --> 15:27.720
- Yeah, yeah you do, but...
- Then give me a chance!

15:27.750 --> 15:30.590
Gimme a chance
to show you the joys of Andre!

15:31.560 --> 15:33.260
♪ Lemme love you ♪

15:33.290 --> 15:36.460
♪ lemme love you like a champion, baby... ♪

15:36.500 --> 15:40.870
- hey! What's goin' on?
- Beck...

15:40.900 --> 15:42.940
What's goin' on is you were just leavin'.

15:42.970 --> 15:46.570
Uh, I have a date with Trina.
We're having chicken.

15:46.610 --> 15:49.480
It kinda might be Turkey now.

15:49.510 --> 15:52.180
Turkey's my favorite.

15:52.210 --> 15:54.080
Yo. Trina likes me.

15:54.120 --> 15:57.520
Well maybe I'm about
to change ol' Trina's mind!

15:57.550 --> 16:02.890
- Dude, go.
- Don't tell me what to do, ya... ya canadian!

16:02.920 --> 16:07.190
- Oh!
- Okay boys, this isn't very...

16:07.230 --> 16:10.360
- I always had a feeling
you were anti-canadian.

16:10.400 --> 16:13.470
So?!
Whatcha gonna do aboot it? Eh?

16:13.500 --> 16:15.300
Eh? Ya gonna hit me
with a hockey bat?

16:15.340 --> 16:17.300
Eh?

16:29.810 --> 16:32.480
- I am soaking wet.
- We all are!

16:32.520 --> 16:38.260
Do you not hear our feet squishing?!

16:40.460 --> 16:45.060
There, Cat... there:
Mona Patterson's front door.

16:45.100 --> 16:45.960
Yeah...

16:46.000 --> 16:49.370
And there aren't any flowers
or cards or anything, see?

16:49.400 --> 16:51.470
No one cares that she died.

16:51.510 --> 16:52.370
Yeah it's so sad.

16:52.410 --> 16:55.640
Now light your dumb candle
and let's get outta here.

16:55.680 --> 16:59.780
'Kay, 'kay.

16:59.820 --> 17:01.520
I thought you were all
psyched to come here.

17:01.550 --> 17:04.750
And "breathe in the fumes
of Mona's lingering soul"

17:04.790 --> 17:09.020
well, it's hard to enjoy it
when my pants are soggy.

17:09.060 --> 17:12.030
I feel like I should say
a few words about her.

17:12.060 --> 17:17.069
Hurry.

17:20.300 --> 17:23.440
Mona Patterson...

17:23.470 --> 17:28.079
I'm so sorry you died.

17:28.109 --> 17:34.150
I used to love watching you
on "I married my mom" and...

17:34.190 --> 17:38.020
- And...
- Go finish for her.

17:45.460 --> 17:50.670
...And Mona,

17:50.700 --> 17:55.200
your memory will live forever
in your work on television...

17:55.240 --> 17:59.170
Where you showed us all
how funny and awkward it is...

17:59.210 --> 18:04.710
When you marry your own mother.

18:04.750 --> 18:07.080
- Amen, let's go.
- C'mon...

18:07.120 --> 18:09.420
Don't you think we should
just wait one more minute...

18:09.450 --> 18:16.030
- Who's out here?!
- Ah!

18:16.060 --> 18:20.530
Be gone, ghost of Mona Patterson!

18:20.570 --> 18:22.870
Go to the light!

18:22.900 --> 18:27.470
Cat...
I'm almost sure she's not dead.

18:27.510 --> 18:31.040
Don't poke that!

18:31.080 --> 18:33.380
Why did you think that she was dead?

18:33.410 --> 18:34.680
I read it online.

18:34.710 --> 18:37.350
It said
"mona Patterson joins the dead."

18:37.380 --> 18:40.350
That's a new tv show, ya dip!

18:40.380 --> 18:44.320
There's a story about me being
cast in a show called "the dead".

18:44.350 --> 18:47.320
I play David Schwimmer's wife.

18:47.360 --> 18:50.730
Ohhh.

18:50.760 --> 18:54.530
Well, nice to meet you...
I'm Cat.

18:54.560 --> 19:02.740
Good, I have something nice for cats...

19:04.470 --> 19:08.010
Whoa now just wait a second!

19:08.040 --> 19:11.210
This girl made us drive
two hours through the rain.

19:11.250 --> 19:15.350
In a topless convertible just because
she loves you and your work.

19:15.390 --> 19:19.950
So would it kill you just to be
a little bit nice and maybe...

19:19.990 --> 19:24.990
Ahhh!

19:26.100 --> 19:29.470
Can't you see we're already wet?!?!

19:29.500 --> 19:32.370
- Get off my property!
- Ah!

19:34.910 --> 19:37.810
- Will you tell this punk-nut
that you like me?!

19:37.840 --> 19:39.640
- Well...
- Punk-nut?!

19:39.680 --> 19:43.510
- Trina made chicken for me!
- Don't you listen to her?!

19:43.550 --> 19:44.650
She made a Turkey!

19:44.680 --> 19:47.780
Why would ya wanna date a canadian that
doesn't know one food bird from another?!

19:47.820 --> 19:49.380
I have an idea.

19:49.420 --> 19:52.690
How about... the three of us
eat the Turkey together?

19:52.720 --> 19:54.890
No!
You pick me or you pick him!

19:54.920 --> 19:57.460
Or maybe I'll pick you up
and toss ya right out that door!

19:57.490 --> 19:59.490
Ooo, I'd love to see you try!

19:59.530 --> 20:02.130
- Boys, I just...
- Trina?

20:02.160 --> 20:05.600
Trina, I brought you these...

20:05.630 --> 20:09.070
Did someone microwave a Turkey?

20:09.100 --> 20:11.640
- Who are those flowers for?!
- They better be for Beck!

20:11.670 --> 20:15.680
- They're for Trina.
- Whaaaaat?!

20:15.710 --> 20:17.440
Well, I heard
the boys in the locker room say.

20:17.480 --> 20:19.080
That Beck asked you out,
so I thought I'd ask you, too...

20:19.120 --> 20:23.080
- Look out, Shapiro!
- Ah!

20:23.120 --> 20:27.820
Trina wants me, not you idiots!

20:27.860 --> 20:35.800
Boys! Don't fight over me!
Boys, come on.

20:35.830 --> 20:40.600
Andre no!!! Don't look!
It's disgusting!

20:40.640 --> 20:41.200
Ah! Oh! Ah! Ow!

20:41.240 --> 20:47.740
Dad! Dad come quick!
They're killing each otherrrrrrrr!!!...

20:52.210 --> 20:59.820
And then Andre started hitting
Robbie with a tea kettle...

20:59.850 --> 21:02.690
- What's going on?
- We're doin' a puppet show.

21:02.720 --> 21:05.120
- I'm the King.
- I'm the queen.

21:05.160 --> 21:10.130
And I'm the little pussy Cat.
Maaaaoooow.

21:10.160 --> 21:12.070
But they were just...
I swear I saw them in there,

21:12.100 --> 21:15.170
- and they were just...
- Just... promise me,

21:15.200 --> 21:20.740
when you go to college,
it'll be someplace far far away.

21:20.770 --> 21:24.940
Trina?
Did you learn your lesson?

21:24.980 --> 21:28.250
- About telling lies?
- Maaaaooow?

21:28.280 --> 21:33.280
- Whoo-hoo

21:47.600 --> 21:50.170
- come on, hamster!
- Run, fat Santa!

21:50.200 --> 21:52.170
- Yeah, baby!
- I love this!

21:52.210 --> 21:54.110
- Wooo!
- Hey, girls...

21:54.140 --> 21:56.480
What was the name of the actress
whose house you went to tonight?

21:56.510 --> 21:58.580
- Mona Patterson.
- Why?

21:58.610 --> 22:04.720
She's on the news...
Channel six.

22:06.750 --> 22:09.590
...But by the time fire
fighters arrived on The Scene,

22:09.620 --> 22:15.860
Mrs. Patterson's house was already
engulfed in flames and could not be saved.

22:15.890 --> 22:17.360
My candle...

22:17.400 --> 22:21.360
No. We don't know for sure.

22:21.400 --> 22:23.730
Lotsa things can start a fire.

22:23.770 --> 22:25.570
The cause of the fire...

22:25.600 --> 22:29.770
This cinnamon bun-
scented candle.

22:29.810 --> 22:34.080
Mrs. Patterson is now resting
uncomfortably in Saint Billy's hospital.

22:34.110 --> 22:36.980
As for who left
the burning candle at the door,

22:37.020 --> 22:41.090
police officials say the only clue
comes from Mrs. Patterson herself.

22:41.120 --> 22:43.760
Who, dazed and confused
from smoke inhalation,

22:43.790 --> 22:46.460
was muttering something about a Cat,

22:46.490 --> 22:49.480
apparently with red fur.

22:49.770 --> 22:51.830
Of course we'll have much more
on this story...

22:51.870 --> 22:54.870
- That's it. If I bring out...
- Tori?

22:56.340 --> 22:58.230
Shhhh.
