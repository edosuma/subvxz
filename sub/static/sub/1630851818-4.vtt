WEBVTT

00:06.005 --> 00:09.926
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:13.138 --> 00:15.390
Yes, a series about

00:16.433 --> 00:17.267
your life.

00:25.108 --> 00:27.444
I know you hate talking about your life.

00:27.527 --> 00:30.363
No, I like talking about my music.

00:30.447 --> 00:33.324
I like talking about my career,

00:33.408 --> 00:35.285
my trajectory...

00:37.370 --> 00:38.955
but not about my private life.

00:40.040 --> 00:42.417
You can do your album with no rush,

00:42.500 --> 00:45.003
you don't have to do another <i>palenque.</i>

00:47.505 --> 00:49.215
Many singers are doing it--

00:49.299 --> 00:52.594
Tell me, when have I ever done
what other singers do?

00:53.636 --> 00:54.471
Right.

00:55.180 --> 00:57.140
I knew it, it was a bad idea.

00:57.223 --> 00:58.933
- No, a terrible idea.
- Fine.

01:00.393 --> 01:02.020
I'll call them and say...

01:05.356 --> 01:06.191
it's a no.

01:07.108 --> 01:08.151
Absolutely not.

02:40.660 --> 02:41.661
Cheers!

02:43.162 --> 02:44.080
Cheers!

02:49.210 --> 02:50.670
- Bye already?
- Got to go.

02:51.296 --> 02:53.548
But we have a barbecue dinner
with my friends.

02:53.631 --> 02:54.757
That's today? No!

02:54.841 --> 02:56.968
I forgot, I'm having dinner
with my sister.

02:57.468 --> 02:59.304
- With your sister?
- Yes, you knew.

02:59.387 --> 03:02.265
You could have the special ribs,
you love those.

03:02.348 --> 03:04.267
Some <i>chorizo</i> or <i>morcilla.</i>

03:04.350 --> 03:05.727
No, but thanks.

03:06.227 --> 03:07.770
Take care, say hi to everyone.

03:07.854 --> 03:09.314
Don't be late on Monday.

03:17.572 --> 03:21.034
Mr. Ambrosi,
just the man I was waiting for.

03:21.117 --> 03:24.037
Me? What for, man?
Don't play with me, I know you.

03:24.537 --> 03:26.581
What are your plans tonight?

03:26.664 --> 03:30.251
Nothing. I think I'll go to the movies
to watch <i>Saving Private Ryan.</i>

03:30.335 --> 03:31.252
Want to come?

03:31.794 --> 03:33.463
You're going to the movies alone?

03:34.214 --> 03:35.089
Yes.

03:35.590 --> 03:37.926
You can't go to the movies
alone on a Friday.

03:38.426 --> 03:39.844
That's totally depressing!

03:40.345 --> 03:43.181
- I have a way better plan.
- Keep talking.

03:43.264 --> 03:45.558
Have you ever been
to a Uruguayan barbecue?

03:54.233 --> 03:55.902
Listen, will you do me a favor?

03:57.070 --> 03:58.238
Sure, tell me.

03:58.321 --> 03:59.530
To my friends,

04:00.573 --> 04:01.908
I'm the manager.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.786
What do you mean, the manager?

04:06.204 --> 04:07.664
- Micky's?
- Of course.

04:07.747 --> 04:08.748
You?

04:08.831 --> 04:09.666
Yes.

04:11.668 --> 04:13.419
Just play along.

04:14.462 --> 04:17.006
You have some balls, man.
But just for today.

04:17.715 --> 04:20.093
- I want no part in it.
- Just for today.

04:20.176 --> 04:21.928
Fuck! And Micky can never find out.

04:22.512 --> 04:23.429
Please.

04:25.348 --> 04:28.559
Good evening, everyone!

04:32.146 --> 04:33.439
Hi, man. Everything good?

04:33.523 --> 04:35.149
Good evening!

04:35.233 --> 04:37.694
- Hi, good evening.
- Bro!

04:39.570 --> 04:42.782
The best jokester you'll ever find.

04:42.865 --> 04:45.159
- Mauricio.
- How's the king of show business?

04:45.243 --> 04:46.869
Hi, Pablito.

04:48.121 --> 04:50.832
This is Mauricio, a co-worker.

04:50.915 --> 04:51.958
- Mau.
- A pleasure.

04:52.041 --> 04:53.835
Are you also Luis Miguel's manager?

04:54.836 --> 04:59.549
Well, I've known him since we were kids
and I'm part of the team.

04:59.632 --> 05:02.301
He's actually his go-to songwriter.

05:02.385 --> 05:04.345
Luis Miguel's songwriter?

05:04.429 --> 05:07.056
- No--
- It's Luis Miguel's songwriter!

05:09.392 --> 05:11.311
- Thanks!
- No fucking way!

05:11.394 --> 05:12.603
Want a drink, Mauricio?

05:12.687 --> 05:14.772
- A beer. Yes, sure, thanks.
- A beer?

05:14.856 --> 05:16.899
Look at that, pure hospitality.

05:17.483 --> 05:19.527
Why would you lie, man?

05:19.610 --> 05:22.071
Just follow my lead.

05:22.155 --> 05:23.740
Come on, enjoy the barbecue.

05:23.823 --> 05:25.700
Here you go, a beer.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.232
And how long are you staying in Mexico?

06:40.274 --> 06:43.444
Frankly, I don't know.
We'll see how things go.

06:43.528 --> 06:46.114
- Have you been to Spain?
- No, I haven't.

06:46.197 --> 06:47.031
Anyway...

06:48.157 --> 06:48.991
What is this?

06:49.492 --> 06:52.078
Call me anytime, okay?

06:52.787 --> 06:53.871
- Deal.
- Great.

06:54.956 --> 06:55.873
A pleasure, María.

06:59.752 --> 07:00.586
Fuck!

07:01.129 --> 07:03.297
And you almost went to the movies alone.

07:05.007 --> 07:07.343
- Going to the movies alone isn't that bad.
- No?

07:07.426 --> 07:09.720
Though I admit I'm having a fucking blast.

07:10.972 --> 07:11.806
Thanks.

07:12.723 --> 07:14.308
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

07:16.227 --> 07:18.688
When I first came to Mexico,
I came with my mom.

07:19.188 --> 07:21.399
My mom was Hugo López's cook.

07:22.692 --> 07:24.652
She cooked, I was his driver.

07:25.361 --> 07:26.529
That's how we got here.

07:26.612 --> 07:28.531
So, to my people, to my friends,

07:28.614 --> 07:30.533
to think that I'm the manager

07:30.616 --> 07:32.493
makes them feel part of it.

07:33.369 --> 07:35.163
They enjoy it, they're happy.

07:35.997 --> 07:38.249
Even if I'm not even the receptionist.

07:42.628 --> 07:44.672
I see, man, why don't you ask Patricio?

07:46.507 --> 07:49.844
You've been there forever,
you get along with everyone.

07:49.927 --> 07:52.305
Damn! You could totally be some sort of

07:53.431 --> 07:54.891
office manager or something.

07:55.808 --> 07:56.893
I mean it.

07:58.269 --> 08:00.938
Patricio wouldn't promote me
if the Pope called him.

08:03.900 --> 08:05.151
What do you think of him?

08:07.612 --> 08:08.654
What can I say?

08:09.822 --> 08:13.451
He'd sell his mother
if it meant closing a deal.

08:14.327 --> 08:15.161
Hey,

08:15.745 --> 08:17.872
we practically started the same year.

08:19.207 --> 08:20.124
Look where he is,

08:20.958 --> 08:22.043
and look where I am.

08:22.126 --> 08:25.213
- He became his manager in two years.
- That's exactly my point.

08:27.048 --> 08:29.091
Don't you find his lifestyle a bit odd?

08:30.968 --> 08:32.637
I don't want to stir anything up,

08:33.888 --> 08:36.766
but I don't understand
how he handles the office money.

08:36.849 --> 08:37.850
He's the boss.

08:39.310 --> 08:40.436
Don't make me talk.

08:41.771 --> 08:42.605
Right.

08:43.189 --> 08:45.441
He's the boss who'll never promote you.

08:54.450 --> 08:56.285
- I'll call you early tomorrow.
- Sure.

09:54.677 --> 09:56.262
Fucking unbelievable!

11:03.537 --> 11:05.873
- How was I?
- Amazing, impeccable, as always.

11:05.956 --> 11:07.750
Guys!

11:07.833 --> 11:08.709
At the end.

11:19.762 --> 11:22.598
Guys, later. At the end.

11:30.189 --> 11:31.565
Doc? Micky.

11:33.109 --> 11:34.610
- Who is it?
- Doc.

11:35.611 --> 11:37.029
What's up, Doc? How are you?

11:37.113 --> 11:39.240
<i>Hi Micky, how's it going?</i>

11:39.323 --> 11:41.992
Great, just finished a concert. You know.

11:42.076 --> 11:43.703
<i>Great. Hey...</i>

11:46.163 --> 11:47.998
<i>Sergio tells me he wants to see you.</i>

11:49.709 --> 11:50.584
Really?

11:51.836 --> 11:53.087
Well, me too.

11:54.463 --> 11:56.132
Want me to go to Boston or--?

11:56.215 --> 11:58.801
<i>No, we can go to Los Angeles.</i>

11:58.884 --> 12:00.469
<i>To get away from the cold.</i>

12:02.012 --> 12:04.557
All right,
I'll send you the tickets and all.

12:04.640 --> 12:05.808
And you guys? All good?

12:05.891 --> 12:07.560
<i>Yes, thank you, all good.</i>

12:07.643 --> 12:09.145
<i>Looking forward to seeing you.</i>

12:09.228 --> 12:11.147
Tell him I really want to see him too.

12:11.647 --> 12:12.648
Hugs.

12:13.399 --> 12:14.525
<i>Bye, Micky.</i>

12:23.200 --> 12:25.619
Micky, you have to pick ten songs.

12:27.121 --> 12:28.998
At least ten. You haven't chosen one!

12:29.832 --> 12:33.002
What can I say, Julio?
I just don't like them.

12:33.586 --> 12:34.962
Are you looking for songs?

12:35.045 --> 12:39.300
Or are you waiting for them to get
to LA so you can reject what I bring?

12:39.383 --> 12:40.217
Julio,

12:41.635 --> 12:43.262
do you know what I am?

12:44.513 --> 12:45.639
A singer.

12:46.682 --> 12:49.101
I'm not in A&R. That's your job.

12:49.185 --> 12:52.104
So, find some good songs,
and then we'll talk.

12:52.188 --> 12:54.190
I thought you wanted to record.

12:54.273 --> 12:57.985
I do want to record,
but not just any old thing you bring me.

12:58.068 --> 13:01.405
Fine. I'm leaving.
See you next week, okay?

13:01.489 --> 13:04.617
I hope we don't have to have
this same discussion again.

13:04.700 --> 13:05.618
So do I.

13:07.661 --> 13:10.247
Are you trying to make
your life more complicated?

13:10.873 --> 13:12.875
Or just make your label mad?

13:13.918 --> 13:15.252
Neither.

13:25.888 --> 13:30.142
It's my duty to remind you, you still
owe Brockhaus millions of dollars.

13:30.226 --> 13:33.729
There's no need to remind me.
The album will be ready when it's ready.

13:33.813 --> 13:34.647
Okay,

13:35.272 --> 13:37.358
when you know what you want,

13:37.983 --> 13:38.859
let me know.

13:46.408 --> 13:47.368
I'm beat.

13:47.868 --> 13:51.205
Did you see their reaction
to "Cómo es Posible"?

13:51.288 --> 13:52.623
- Yeah.
- It's crazy.

13:52.706 --> 13:54.959
- They like it, don't they?
- I loved it.

13:58.295 --> 14:00.047
When are they taking all this away?

14:00.130 --> 14:02.132
The boxes will be gone next week, Micky.

14:02.716 --> 14:03.551
Everything.

14:04.468 --> 14:07.179
Oh, and the deeds are all set.

14:08.180 --> 14:09.848
I took them to McCluskey.

14:09.932 --> 14:12.268
I can't believe this is no longer mine.

14:15.854 --> 14:16.981
Hey, by the way,

14:17.064 --> 14:19.984
besides Doc, has anyone else called?

14:21.277 --> 14:22.111
Patricio,

14:22.653 --> 14:26.323
but only to remind me some stuff
he needed for your dressing room.

14:26.407 --> 14:27.241
Anyone else?

14:28.701 --> 14:29.577
Take a look.

14:30.494 --> 14:32.329
Take this to my room, will you?

14:34.415 --> 14:35.249
Okay.

14:36.125 --> 14:38.294
- Is everything okay?
- I'm good, Joe, thanks.

15:21.086 --> 15:22.254
How was the concert?

15:22.796 --> 15:23.631
Good.

15:24.840 --> 15:25.674
Good.

15:29.345 --> 15:31.013
Can you spare a minute, Patricio?

15:31.722 --> 15:34.308
Yes, I know, no need to frown.
I know you're busy.

15:36.060 --> 15:38.520
This wasn't our deal.

15:40.147 --> 15:42.399
What did you tell me when we started here?

15:43.567 --> 15:45.235
That I'd have a serious position,

15:46.320 --> 15:48.572
not take care of someone
who's never in town--

15:48.656 --> 15:51.700
How was I supposed to know
Luis Miguel would move to LA?

15:53.619 --> 15:54.453
Fine.

15:57.331 --> 15:59.249
Get me something in the office.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.335
There's plenty to do.

16:02.753 --> 16:04.129
Ask around.

16:08.384 --> 16:09.468
You're not following.

16:11.178 --> 16:13.347
Give me a promotion, something serious.

16:14.181 --> 16:15.599
Tour manager, for instance.

16:16.642 --> 16:17.601
Don't forget,

16:18.394 --> 16:19.478
if it weren't for me...

16:22.690 --> 16:24.066
this office wouldn't exist.

16:27.861 --> 16:30.197
So, it was your idea to start all this?

16:32.366 --> 16:33.200
José,

16:34.076 --> 16:36.078
you can't go from driver

16:36.620 --> 16:38.831
to tour manager in three years.

16:38.914 --> 16:39.748
Why not?

16:41.041 --> 16:42.251
Don't be ridiculous.

19:15.946 --> 19:16.947
Pichita!

19:17.030 --> 19:18.073
<i>What's up, Micky?</i>

19:18.157 --> 19:20.242
<i>I'm at a dinner party in Puebla.</i>

19:20.325 --> 19:22.202
Why don't you come over a few days?

19:22.286 --> 19:23.537
I need to relax.

19:24.204 --> 19:26.582
<i>Well, that doesn't sound
too bad, Micky. When?</i>

19:27.082 --> 19:28.000
Well, tomorrow.

19:29.835 --> 19:30.711
<i>Tomorrow?</i>

19:31.336 --> 19:32.588
That's what I said, man.

19:35.299 --> 19:36.884
<i>Can't it be next week?</i>

19:39.344 --> 19:41.763
<i>As I said, I'm in Puebla, closing a deal.</i>

19:42.848 --> 19:43.682
You?

19:46.810 --> 19:48.187
What do you have to do?

19:48.270 --> 19:49.146
<i>Micky...</i>

19:51.899 --> 19:52.733
Tell me.

19:53.942 --> 19:56.195
<i>Sergiño is here from Thursday to Sunday.</i>

19:59.865 --> 20:00.699
Sergio?

20:04.828 --> 20:05.662
Why?

20:07.706 --> 20:09.416
<i>We're having a get together. It's...</i>

20:11.752 --> 20:13.170
<i>the Gallegos, Micky.</i>

20:24.014 --> 20:25.933
You're really going to meet with them?

20:26.683 --> 20:29.519
<i>Yes, Mario and Jorge are coming to visit.</i>

20:29.603 --> 20:31.104
<i>That's why I didn't tell you.</i>

20:31.813 --> 20:32.898
Oh, I see.

20:34.566 --> 20:35.442
Have fun.

21:20.612 --> 21:22.322
- Hello?
<i>-Hi, Micky.</i>

21:23.073 --> 21:24.616
Doc! What's up?

21:25.242 --> 21:27.035
<i>Just hanging, waiting for you.</i>

21:33.667 --> 21:34.876
No.

21:35.669 --> 21:39.464
I don't think
I can make it today, Doc, sorry.

21:39.548 --> 21:41.717
<i>-What do you mean you're not coming?</i>
- Micky?

21:41.800 --> 21:42.926
Well--

21:43.010 --> 21:44.094
<i>Where are you?</i>

21:46.471 --> 21:47.472
<i>Micky?</i>

21:48.932 --> 21:50.017
I'll tell you later.

22:40.359 --> 22:44.321
You wouldn't believe how many people
have recorded in that studio, Dad.

22:44.404 --> 22:45.280
I bet.

22:46.198 --> 22:48.075
And I'm obviously changing the lobby.

22:48.742 --> 22:49.785
I hate that rug.

22:50.660 --> 22:51.495
Yeah.

22:53.246 --> 22:56.124
How many people do you have working here?

22:56.208 --> 22:58.126
On all three floors, almost 60.

22:58.210 --> 23:00.212
- Sixty!
- Sixty?

23:00.295 --> 23:03.173
Isn't that too many
for a company like this?

23:03.256 --> 23:07.302
No, we have image consultants,
publicists, lawyers--

23:07.386 --> 23:10.389
Lawyers?
Weren't you hiring Villegas's daughter?

23:10.472 --> 23:13.600
Karla? Yes, she has a team downstairs.

23:15.560 --> 23:18.563
I see you bought the Toledo painting.

23:18.647 --> 23:21.108
- It's beautiful.
- Lovely.

23:22.109 --> 23:23.318
- Thanks, Dad.
- Yes.

23:24.403 --> 23:27.155
In fact, when we were in the gallery
with him in Oaxaca,

23:27.823 --> 23:29.324
Sergio Hernández dropped by--

23:29.408 --> 23:30.784
- What happened?
- What is it?

23:31.284 --> 23:33.120
You didn't pay the electricity bill?

23:33.203 --> 23:36.081
Did you spend all the money
on the Toledo painting?

23:36.164 --> 23:37.416
I'll be right back.

23:37.499 --> 23:41.044
Hey, stop undermining him.
He's doing great--

23:42.295 --> 23:44.131
- Joe!
- What is it, Julián?

23:45.048 --> 23:46.508
Who bought the regulators?

23:46.591 --> 23:48.385
How should I know?

23:48.468 --> 23:51.471
- I hope my computer didn't get fried.
- What's with the power?

23:51.972 --> 23:52.806
It went out.

23:53.515 --> 23:55.809
Buy a regulator
so this doesn't happen again.

23:55.892 --> 23:58.520
- Fix it, damn it.
- I was about to check the breakers.

23:58.603 --> 24:01.022
First thing in the morning,
it must be back.

24:03.358 --> 24:06.111
What happened? Don't the elevators work?

24:06.194 --> 24:07.362
No, they don't, Uncle.

24:08.655 --> 24:11.366
- We'll take the stairs.
- The stairs?

24:11.450 --> 24:13.368
Honey, it's 30 floors!

26:20.537 --> 26:23.623
Okay, it should run smoothly now.

26:23.707 --> 26:24.666
No problem.

26:26.710 --> 26:30.589
Buy No Breaks, so that when
there's an outage, you don't lose data.

26:30.672 --> 26:32.424
Okay. Andrea?

26:33.925 --> 26:36.052
Buy No Breaks for the whole office.

26:37.012 --> 26:39.973
Call the gentleman next week
so he can install them.

26:41.433 --> 26:42.434
Thanks.

26:42.517 --> 26:44.811
Okay, that'll be all.

26:47.564 --> 26:49.274
If you need anything,

26:49.357 --> 26:51.443
you have my number. At your service.

26:51.526 --> 26:52.360
Thanks.

26:53.028 --> 26:54.237
- See you.
- Bye.

26:55.905 --> 26:56.740
Thanks.

27:00.285 --> 27:03.121
Doc! Hey, are you still in LA?

27:03.204 --> 27:05.081
<i>No, we're on our way to the airport.</i>

27:05.165 --> 27:06.082
No. What?

27:06.583 --> 27:09.085
Go back to the suite,
I'll see you in half an hour.

27:09.169 --> 27:10.837
<i>No, Micky, it's too late.</i>

27:11.880 --> 27:12.797
I want to see you.

27:13.548 --> 27:14.424
I really do.

27:15.967 --> 27:18.261
<i>-I'll talk to Sergio.</i>
- Okay, see you there.

27:21.890 --> 27:23.850
- Look at him!
- Well, yeah!

27:23.933 --> 27:25.852
I mean, so I've been told.

27:25.935 --> 27:29.939
But anyway, cheers to all the times
we've been told things.

27:30.023 --> 27:33.985
- To cousins and to Mexico, guys!
<i>-</i> So, where to next?

27:34.653 --> 27:35.570
Next?

27:36.237 --> 27:37.906
Well, to bed, right?

27:37.989 --> 27:39.324
- For fuck's sake!
- To bed?

27:39.407 --> 27:41.785
Listen, had I known,
I would've stayed in Cádiz.

27:42.786 --> 27:44.788
You just can't please this guy!

27:49.834 --> 27:50.919
Micky!

27:51.419 --> 27:52.379
What a surprise!

27:57.592 --> 27:58.468
Hey!

27:59.260 --> 28:01.554
Join us. How are you?

28:02.722 --> 28:03.556
Good.

28:04.599 --> 28:06.059
- How about you?
- Just fine.

28:06.142 --> 28:07.310
Thanks for inviting me.

28:07.894 --> 28:08.978
It's good to see you.

28:13.024 --> 28:14.150
This is great.

28:14.234 --> 28:16.152
- It's delicious.
- Wow!

28:22.617 --> 28:23.827
How are you, Sergio?

28:27.956 --> 28:28.873
<i>No ice, right?</i>

28:29.582 --> 28:32.168
Right, no ice.

28:33.795 --> 28:35.255
How have you been, Doc?

28:36.381 --> 28:37.298
Where's Sergiño?

28:38.049 --> 28:39.759
Did he get lost at Disney or what?

28:41.511 --> 28:42.554
Well--

28:43.972 --> 28:45.890
Sergiño went back to Boston.

28:46.516 --> 28:48.393
No kidding! Alone?

28:49.310 --> 28:50.145
Right.

28:56.693 --> 28:58.695
We agreed both of you would come.

28:58.778 --> 29:00.238
Yeah, but he went back.

29:01.948 --> 29:03.116
He didn't want to come.

29:04.075 --> 29:06.035
Because I made him wait one day?

29:07.287 --> 29:08.163
Come on!

29:10.832 --> 29:13.543
I was hoping to talk to you, though,

29:14.919 --> 29:16.171
about a couple of things.

29:16.254 --> 29:17.630
What kind of things?

29:17.714 --> 29:20.383
Well, Sergiño wants to go on vacation,

29:20.884 --> 29:21.926
to the beach.

29:23.094 --> 29:24.721
We need a car,

29:24.804 --> 29:26.848
and the apartment needs

29:26.931 --> 29:28.933
a lot of fixes.

29:32.103 --> 29:33.229
Those kinds of things.

29:42.739 --> 29:43.573
Tell me,

29:44.783 --> 29:48.328
did Sergio want to come see me
or did you make him?

29:49.579 --> 29:50.830
No, he wanted to see you.

29:50.914 --> 29:51.748
Don't...

29:53.416 --> 29:54.793
lie to me.

29:56.503 --> 29:57.921
I'm not lying, Micky.

29:59.339 --> 30:00.673
He wanted to come see you.

30:02.884 --> 30:03.802
He's your brother.

30:06.429 --> 30:07.555
You know what I think?

30:09.307 --> 30:12.519
I think you set up this trip to LA

30:12.602 --> 30:14.312
just to ask me for money.

30:17.649 --> 30:18.483
Well, I didn't.

30:19.567 --> 30:22.779
- I've never done that.
- There's a first time for everything.

30:24.113 --> 30:25.281
My brother?

30:25.365 --> 30:26.324
This is for you.

30:26.407 --> 30:28.117
No, it's stuff for your brother.

30:28.827 --> 30:32.038
He's growing up,
he needs more stuff, it's normal.

30:33.289 --> 30:34.707
He also needs distractions,

30:34.791 --> 30:38.002
which is also normal
because he feels lonely.

30:38.711 --> 30:39.546
So what?

30:40.964 --> 30:42.048
Is that my fault too?

30:42.674 --> 30:44.425
Well, yeah.

30:44.509 --> 30:45.426
You never see him.

30:50.265 --> 30:52.100
I sent him to that school in Boston.

30:53.351 --> 30:55.687
The most expensive school in the US.

30:55.770 --> 30:57.355
I pay his tuition.

30:57.939 --> 30:59.858
I pay for your house.

31:00.483 --> 31:02.235
Sergio is my brother.

31:02.318 --> 31:06.364
That's why I'll give him
everything he needs until he turns 18.

31:06.447 --> 31:07.407
After that,

31:08.324 --> 31:10.660
the free ride is over,

31:11.244 --> 31:12.245
both his and yours.

31:17.500 --> 31:20.003
Why do you mistreat
the people who love you?

31:20.086 --> 31:21.296
The people who love me

31:22.297 --> 31:23.673
don't take advantage of me.

31:44.777 --> 31:46.613
- No, man.
- Take us there.

31:46.696 --> 31:48.406
I wanna go too.

31:49.365 --> 31:51.951
- Aren't you tagging along?
- Why won't you take me?

31:52.035 --> 31:53.077
One coffee, please.

31:53.161 --> 31:54.078
Let's go, then.

31:54.746 --> 31:57.040
- Where is that place?
- Of course not, Micky!

31:57.123 --> 31:58.124
It's all set, then.

31:58.207 --> 31:59.250
So, where--?

32:00.543 --> 32:02.253
- Where do you live?
- In Madrid.

32:04.797 --> 32:06.466
Such a beautiful city.

32:09.385 --> 32:10.219
You like it?

32:11.387 --> 32:12.930
Yeah, what about you?

32:14.140 --> 32:15.058
What about me?

32:16.351 --> 32:17.477
Where do you live?

32:18.937 --> 32:20.647
I'm not sure about this.

32:20.730 --> 32:23.608
- Fuck, you guys are stubborn.
- Where are you taking us?

32:23.691 --> 32:25.068
I'm in LA right now.

32:26.319 --> 32:28.655
- I have a house, though I like--
- Hey, Micky!

32:28.738 --> 32:30.490
When are we getting a new album?

32:30.573 --> 32:33.159
A new album? He doesn't sing anymore, man.

32:33.242 --> 32:34.994
- Yes, he does.
- Of course he sings.

32:35.078 --> 32:37.664
Tell us about that problem
you had with that singer.

32:38.247 --> 32:40.708
- What's his name?
- Was his manager stealing?

32:40.792 --> 32:41.959
- No!
- He was!

32:42.043 --> 32:44.921
Don't tell me you have
money problems, Micky.

32:45.004 --> 32:47.173
Alex, why do you hang out
with these idiots?

32:47.256 --> 32:49.258
- Say it to our faces!
- Okay, enough.

32:49.342 --> 32:51.552
- No. What's all this?
- Why are we here?

32:51.636 --> 32:54.973
- Fine, just chill.
- Let's get the check and be on our way.

32:55.056 --> 32:57.266
No, it's been paid. You can go.

32:57.350 --> 32:58.685
I'm taking this. Let's go.

32:58.768 --> 33:02.855
- Let's have fun.
- This suits him just fine.

33:03.648 --> 33:05.566
- Let's go, okay?
- Just move!

33:07.652 --> 33:08.861
Is that why you came?

33:11.447 --> 33:12.782
To ruin the meal?

33:12.865 --> 33:15.118
I'm here to see you.

33:20.331 --> 33:22.000
We haven't spoken in 15 years.

33:25.420 --> 33:27.588
I finally see you,
and you insult my family?

33:27.672 --> 33:28.756
No.

33:30.842 --> 33:32.093
They're not your family,

33:32.969 --> 33:34.804
I'm your family.

33:34.887 --> 33:36.055
Don't get it wrong.

33:36.931 --> 33:37.849
Okay now.

33:37.932 --> 33:41.185
I told my driver to take them,
we'll catch up with them later.

33:41.269 --> 33:43.438
Pass me a glass of tequila, please.

33:43.521 --> 33:44.731
Filled to the top.

33:44.814 --> 33:47.358
Everything has to revolve around you.

33:47.442 --> 33:49.944
I know, right?
I never give you guys anything.

33:50.028 --> 33:51.863
Is this about you paying my tuition?

33:51.946 --> 33:54.574
Sergio, it was a bit more
than just tuition.

33:58.494 --> 33:59.412
What do you want?

34:00.496 --> 34:02.415
For me to get down on my knees?

34:03.124 --> 34:04.375
Well, for starters,

34:05.501 --> 34:07.336
I wouldn't mind a thank you.

34:14.677 --> 34:17.096
And I thought you came to apologize.

34:17.180 --> 34:18.014
Apologize?

34:18.765 --> 34:19.974
For what?

34:20.058 --> 34:23.227
For when you sent me
to boarding school, when I was ten.

34:23.311 --> 34:26.689
- Or for only visiting me six times.
- You were hard to get a hold of.

34:27.356 --> 34:29.901
I do remember going to LA with Doc,

34:30.526 --> 34:31.944
and you standing us up.

34:35.656 --> 34:38.618
You didn't visit.
I didn't know anything about you.

34:38.701 --> 34:40.870
What did you want
to know about me, Sergiño?

34:42.872 --> 34:44.874
All you've ever wanted from me is money.

34:45.833 --> 34:46.709
Isn't that right?

34:49.295 --> 34:50.213
A month ago,

34:51.172 --> 34:52.840
this producer in Spain called me.

34:52.924 --> 34:55.510
He offered me millions to talk about you.

34:57.637 --> 34:58.888
You know what I told him?

35:00.848 --> 35:02.391
To go screw himself.

35:03.684 --> 35:05.686
That's how much I profit from you.

35:05.770 --> 35:08.064
Sergio, for fuck's sake.

35:08.648 --> 35:09.982
- Come on.
- I can't, man.

35:10.566 --> 35:11.859
- Hey, come on.
- No, man.

35:11.943 --> 35:13.903
- Stay a while.
- I mean it, I can't.

35:13.986 --> 35:14.821
Sergio!

35:17.490 --> 35:18.407
See you in a bit.

35:37.176 --> 35:38.136
Excuse me.

35:38.719 --> 35:39.804
Sorry, sir.

35:40.388 --> 35:42.390
Would you give me your autograph?

35:43.015 --> 35:45.518
My mom and I are your biggest fans.

35:49.605 --> 35:51.774
Of course. What's your name?

35:52.692 --> 35:53.734
Federico, sir.

35:55.695 --> 35:56.737
And your mom's?

35:56.821 --> 35:57.655
Lupita.

36:21.220 --> 36:22.054
Here.

36:24.015 --> 36:24.891
Thanks.

36:26.767 --> 36:28.269
Okay, now, tell me,

36:28.352 --> 36:29.645
how did it go in Mexico?

36:29.729 --> 36:30.730
Not too well.

36:31.772 --> 36:33.816
Look, Azucena just sent me this.

36:38.654 --> 36:40.364
It's nothing but gossip, bro.

36:40.448 --> 36:42.909
Just because someone says
they're making a series

36:42.992 --> 36:44.160
doesn't mean they can.

36:44.243 --> 36:46.245
It's the second time this week

36:46.329 --> 36:47.330
I hear someone

36:47.914 --> 36:49.999
wants to do a series about my life.

36:50.791 --> 36:51.834
What can I say?

36:51.918 --> 36:53.377
Today, it's gossip,

36:53.461 --> 36:57.590
but next thing you know, any asshole
can buy the rights to Cynthia Casas's book

36:57.673 --> 37:00.051
or any of my tons
of unauthorized biographies

37:00.134 --> 37:01.385
and then, I'm screwed.

37:02.595 --> 37:03.429
Yeah.

37:15.232 --> 37:16.275
You know what?

37:26.452 --> 37:27.912
I'll do the series,

37:29.705 --> 37:31.040
but with your team.

37:32.708 --> 37:33.751
You know why?

37:35.753 --> 37:37.255
Because I trust you, bro.

37:38.756 --> 37:40.841
Let's do that damn series the right way.

37:44.303 --> 37:46.138
No one's going to tell my story

37:46.681 --> 37:47.515
but me.

37:58.985 --> 38:00.194
Go ahead, Gabriel.

38:04.907 --> 38:05.866
Good morning.

38:10.955 --> 38:12.123
Morning.

38:18.421 --> 38:19.255
Okay.

38:20.715 --> 38:22.425
No, it's not urgent, it's fine.

38:28.097 --> 38:30.016
All right, perfect. So, I'll--

38:30.099 --> 38:32.018
Let's do this, we'll talk later.

38:32.685 --> 38:33.769
Okay now, thanks.

38:34.770 --> 38:35.646
Bye.

38:36.814 --> 38:39.942
Hello. Hey, I see you took care
of the power situation, thanks.

38:42.153 --> 38:44.905
Mr. Ambrosi, nothing happens by chance.

38:45.781 --> 38:46.699
Whatever happens

38:47.783 --> 38:49.285
is because we make it happen.

38:50.703 --> 38:51.537
I don't get it.

38:53.998 --> 38:55.833
I couldn't just sit and do nothing.

39:04.925 --> 39:07.803
This contains how much the Robles make.

39:09.138 --> 39:10.723
Each expense they've ever made.

39:11.640 --> 39:13.517
And I don't know much about finance,

39:15.978 --> 39:19.065
but I do know when people take
what doesn't belong to them.

45:19.508 --> 45:24.513
