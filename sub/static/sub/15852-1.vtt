01:39.808 --> 01:43.270
9:13. Personal note.

01:44.605 --> 01:47.357
When I was a little kid,

01:47.482 --> 01:50.903
my mother told me
not to stare into the sun.

01:50.986 --> 01:54.072
So once, when I was six, I did.

01:54.198 --> 01:58.035
The doctors didn't know
if my eyes would ever heal.

01:59.453 --> 02:01.663
I was terrified,

02:01.788 --> 02:04.291
alone in that darkness.

02:05.501 --> 02:07.503
Slowly,

02:07.628 --> 02:10.881
daylight crept in
through the bandages

02:11.006 --> 02:13.175
and I could see.

02:13.300 --> 02:15.802
But something else
had changed inside me.

02:18.222 --> 02:21.266
That day
I had my first headache.

02:24.436 --> 02:27.523
Jenna, come back here.

02:28.690 --> 02:30.943
Max, Max, can I do it?

02:31.026 --> 02:38.075
- Jenna.
- What's 322 times 491?

02:38.200 --> 02:40.619
158,102. Right?

02:40.744 --> 02:42.746
Right!

02:42.871 --> 02:45.374
OK, 73 divided by 22?

02:45.499 --> 02:48.836
3.318...18...18...

02:48.961 --> 02:52.589
..18...18...18...18...

03:09.064 --> 03:12.401
12:45.
Restate my assumptions.

03:12.568 --> 03:15.237
One: Mathematics
is the language of nature.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.951
Two: Everything around us

03:21.076 --> 03:23.328
can be represented and
understood through numbers.

03:27.374 --> 03:30.919
Three: If you graph the numbers
of any system, patterns emerge.

03:32.880 --> 03:36.967
Therefore, there are patterns
everywhere in nature.

03:39.761 --> 03:41.096
Evidence:

03:41.555 --> 03:43.390
The cycling
of disease epidemics;

03:44.975 --> 03:47.269
the wax and wane
of caribou populations;

03:48.604 --> 03:50.022
sun spot cycles;

03:51.398 --> 03:54.651
the rise and fall of the Nile.

03:58.822 --> 04:01.241
So, what about
the stock market?

04:01.366 --> 04:04.578
The universe of numbers that
represents the global economy.

04:04.703 --> 04:07.748
Millions of hands at work,
billions of minds.

04:07.873 --> 04:11.835
A vast network, screaming
with life. An organism.

04:11.960 --> 04:14.213
A natural organism.

04:14.338 --> 04:16.632
My hypothesis:

04:16.757 --> 04:20.219
Within the stock market,
there is a pattern as well...

04:20.344 --> 04:21.803
Right in front of me,

04:21.928 --> 04:25.432
hiding behind the numbers.
Always has been.

04:25.557 --> 04:27.726
12:50, press return.

04:46.203 --> 04:47.579
Hello.

04:47.704 --> 04:49.164
Maximillian Cohen, please.

04:49.289 --> 04:52.167
- Yeah?
- Hi, it's Marcy Dawson.

04:52.292 --> 04:55.170
I'm a partner at the predictive
strategy firm...

04:55.295 --> 04:57.089
- I told you...
- Sorry I haven't called.

04:57.214 --> 05:00.509
I hoped we could have lunch
tomorrow. Say one o'clock?

05:25.576 --> 05:27.870
- Max, good.
- Hey, Devi.

05:27.995 --> 05:30.581
- I grabbed you some samosas.
- Great.

05:31.540 --> 05:34.001
- Your hair!
- What are you doing?

05:34.126 --> 05:37.045
- You can't go out like that.
- It's fine.

05:37.171 --> 05:40.215
- Don't worry.
- It's fine.

05:41.800 --> 05:44.178
- You need a mom.
- I gotta go.

05:44.970 --> 05:50.100
Max. Here, your samosas.

05:49.885 --> 05:51.887
Thanks.

05:53.722 --> 05:57.184
16:23. Results.

05:57.351 --> 06:00.062
Euclid predicts
NTC will break 100 tomorrow.

06:00.145 --> 06:02.731
A good bet. Other anomalies:

06:02.857 --> 06:06.443
lt predicts PRO NET settling
at sixty-five and a quarter,

06:06.569 --> 06:08.237
a career high.

06:08.362 --> 06:12.575
Am I bothering you?
I'm sorry, I'll put it out.

06:13.117 --> 06:14.243
Name's Lenny Meyer.

06:16.078 --> 06:17.163
And you are?

06:18.622 --> 06:19.331
Max.

06:19.456 --> 06:22.459
Is that Max? Max...?

06:22.585 --> 06:26.380
- Max Cohen.
- Cohen! Jewish.

06:28.883 --> 06:33.095
It's OK. I'm a Jew too.
Do you practise?

06:33.220 --> 06:35.806
No. I'm not interested
in religion.

06:37.183 --> 06:40.603
- Did you ever hear of Kabbalah?
- No.

06:40.686 --> 06:43.230
- Jewish mysticism.
- Look, I'm busy right here.

06:43.057 --> 06:45.476
I understand.

06:46.561 --> 06:50.648
But right now is a very exciting
moment in our history.

06:50.773 --> 06:54.902
Right now is
a critical moment in time.

06:55.027 --> 06:57.822
- Really?
- Yeah. It's very exciting.

06:57.947 --> 07:02.326
Have you ever put on Tefillin?
You know Tefillin?

07:02.451 --> 07:05.788
Yeah, I know, it looks strange.
It's an amazing tradition.

07:05.913 --> 07:09.584
It has a tremendous power. It's
a mitzvah Jewish men should do.

07:09.709 --> 07:12.795
Mitzvahs, good deeds.
They purify us.

07:12.920 --> 07:15.965
Bring us closer to God.
Wanna try it?

07:16.090 --> 07:19.010
- Shit.
- You all right, Max?

07:37.486 --> 07:40.531
Please. Please, a small one.

07:42.658 --> 07:46.871
17:55. Personal note.
Second attack in under 24 hours.

07:47.872 --> 07:50.583
Administered 80 milligrams
Promozine HCI

07:50.708 --> 07:53.085
and six milligrams
Sumattrapan orally,

07:53.211 --> 07:56.088
as well as one milligram
Dihydroric-atamine-mezilayte

07:56.214 --> 07:58.090
by subcutaneous injection.

09:49.452 --> 09:52.538
- Hi.
- Mr Cohen?

09:52.663 --> 09:55.333
Marcy Dawson here again,
from Lancet-Percy.

09:55.458 --> 10:00.505
I checked my schedule and I'm
in Chinatown tomorrow at three.

10:00.630 --> 10:03.966
I'd love to stop by to meet you.

10:04.091 --> 10:06.802
It'll be worth it for us.
How's three sound?

10:06.886 --> 10:10.932
- How did you get my address?
- I got it from Columbia.

10:11.057 --> 10:12.975
Three it is.
Looking forward to it.

10:13.059 --> 10:15.770
Wait a minute...

10:48.344 --> 10:49.303
Max.

11:11.492 --> 11:13.536
Stop thinking, Max.

11:13.661 --> 11:16.664
Just feel. Use your intuition.

11:24.130 --> 11:28.467
- What did you think of Hamlet?
- I didn't get to it.

11:28.593 --> 11:33.931
It's been a month. You haven't
taken a single break.

11:37.351 --> 11:39.770
I'm so close.

11:42.356 --> 11:45.902
Have you met the new fish
my niece bought me?

11:46.027 --> 11:50.823
I named her lcarus after you,
my renegade pupil.

11:50.948 --> 11:54.160
You fly too high,
you'll get burnt.

11:54.994 --> 11:57.872
I look at you,
I see myself 30 years ago.

11:57.997 --> 12:04.212
My greatest pupil.
Published at 16, PhD at 20.

12:04.337 --> 12:07.798
But life
isn't just mathematics, Max.

12:07.924 --> 12:11.802
I spent 40 years searching
for patterns in Pi.

12:12.762 --> 12:15.973
- I found nothing.
- You found things.

12:17.141 --> 12:18.684
I found things...

12:20.394 --> 12:22.480
but not a pattern.

12:26.359 --> 12:29.821
Not a pattern.

12:29.946 --> 12:33.282
11:22. Personal note.

12:33.407 --> 12:36.869
Sol died a little when
he stopped research on Pi.

12:38.496 --> 12:41.666
It wasn't just the stroke.

12:41.791 --> 12:44.836
He stopped caring.

12:47.338 --> 12:48.798
How could he stop,

12:48.923 --> 12:53.386
when he was so close to seeing
Pi for what it really is?

12:58.891 --> 13:02.311
How could you stop believing
that there is a pattern,

13:02.436 --> 13:05.898
an ordered shape behind those
numbers, when you were so close?

13:10.695 --> 13:13.156
We see the simplicity
of the circle,

13:13.281 --> 13:16.075
we see the maddening complexity
of the endless numbers,

13:16.200 --> 13:19.912
3.14 off into infinity.

13:20.037 --> 13:22.707
# Are the stars out tonight?

13:22.832 --> 13:26.460
# I don't mind
if they're cloudy or bright

13:28.212 --> 13:32.008
# For I only have eyes

13:32.133 --> 13:35.094
# For you, dear

13:37.013 --> 13:40.057
# I don't mind
if we're in a... #

14:07.502 --> 14:10.004
Hey, Max.

14:10.129 --> 14:11.672
Lenny Meyer.

14:12.715 --> 14:13.758
I'll put it out.

14:16.552 --> 14:19.722
So... What do you do?

14:22.934 --> 14:26.479
I work with computers. Math.

14:26.604 --> 14:28.606
Math? What kind of math?

14:28.773 --> 14:31.150
Number theory. Research mostly.

14:31.275 --> 14:33.736
No way.
I work with numbers myself.

14:33.861 --> 14:38.074
I mean, not traditional.
I work with the Torah. Amazing!

14:40.993 --> 14:44.288
Hebrew is all math.
It's all numbers.

14:45.456 --> 14:47.124
You know that? Look.

14:47.250 --> 14:50.378
Ancient Jews used Hebrew
as their numerical system.

14:50.503 --> 14:52.797
Each letter's a number.

14:52.922 --> 14:57.760
The Hebrew A, Aleph, is 1 .
B, Bet, is 2.

14:57.885 --> 15:01.764
Understand? But look,
the numbers are interrelated.

15:01.848 --> 15:04.350
Take the Hebrew for father, ab.

15:04.517 --> 15:07.520
Aleph, Bet.

15:07.645 --> 15:10.147
1, 2 equals 3.

15:10.273 --> 15:12.441
The word for mother, haim.

15:12.567 --> 15:15.403
Aleph, Mem.

15:15.528 --> 15:21.742
1, 40 equals 41 .
The sum of 3 and 41, 44.

15:21.868 --> 15:26.789
Right? Now, the Hebrew word for
child - mother, father, child.

15:26.914 --> 15:29.125
Yelev.

15:29.250 --> 15:32.295
That's 10, 30 and 4.

15:34.463 --> 15:35.173
44.

15:37.508 --> 15:40.553
Torah is just
a long string of numbers.

15:40.678 --> 15:45.099
Some say that it's a code,
sent to us from God.

15:45.183 --> 15:46.642
That's kind of interesting.

15:46.809 --> 15:49.270
That's kid's stuff,
check this out.

15:49.395 --> 15:51.939
The Garden of Eden, Kadem.

15:52.064 --> 15:55.318
Numerical translation, 144.

15:56.402 --> 15:59.697
The value of tree of knowledge,
in the garden. Right?

15:59.822 --> 16:04.327
Aat ha haim. 2, 33. 1, 44. 2, 33.

16:04.452 --> 16:07.330
- You can take those numbers...
- Those are Fibonacci numbers.

16:07.455 --> 16:08.372
They're...?

16:08.498 --> 16:11.417
You know,
like the Fibonacci sequence?

16:11.542 --> 16:12.919
Fibonacci?

16:13.044 --> 16:20.051
Fibonacci is an ltalian
mathematician in the 13th.

16:20.176 --> 16:23.888
If you divide 144 into 233,

16:23.971 --> 16:27.934
- the result approaches Theta.
- Theta?

16:28.059 --> 16:34.357
Theta. The Greek symbol for the
golden ratio, the golden spiral.

16:35.733 --> 16:37.735
Wow.

16:37.860 --> 16:41.239
I never saw that before.

16:41.364 --> 16:44.325
That's like that series
you find in nature?

16:44.450 --> 16:49.163
- Like the face of a sunflower?
- Wherever there are spirals.

16:49.288 --> 16:51.833
See, there's math everywhere.

17:13.765 --> 17:16.059
Hey, I... Max?

17:16.518 --> 17:20.104
13:26. Restate my assumptions.

17:27.529 --> 17:31.616
can be represented
and understood through numbers.

17:36.830 --> 17:39.541
patterns emerge.

17:39.666 --> 17:43.336
Therefore, there are patterns
everywhere in nature.

17:43.461 --> 17:45.672
So what about the stock market?

17:45.797 --> 17:48.842
A universe of numbers that
represents the global economy.

17:48.925 --> 17:51.636
Millions of human hands
at work, billions of minds.

17:51.761 --> 17:54.931
A vast network screaming
with life. An organism.

17:55.056 --> 17:57.475
A natural organism.

18:01.437 --> 18:04.524
there is a pattern,
right in front of me,

18:04.649 --> 18:07.026
playing with the numbers.
Always has been.

18:08.027 --> 18:10.196
10:18, press return.

18:26.880 --> 18:28.006
Max.

18:30.633 --> 18:32.302
Max.

18:45.690 --> 18:47.192
What the...?

18:52.614 --> 18:54.365
Shit!

18:54.949 --> 18:57.952
Aaargh! God damn it!

19:01.289 --> 19:03.958
10:28. Results.

19:04.042 --> 19:09.589
Bullshit. Euclid predicts AAR
at six and a half.

19:09.756 --> 19:13.384
AAR hasn't been
beneath 40 in 20 years.

19:13.510 --> 19:17.764
Explanations for anomaly:
Human error.

20:59.115 --> 21:01.951
11:11. Results.

21:03.870 --> 21:06.247
Failed treatments to date:

21:06.372 --> 21:11.544
Beta blockers, calcium channel
blockers, adrenaline injections,

21:11.669 --> 21:14.881
high-dose ibuprofen, steroids,

21:14.964 --> 21:19.385
trigger metastics,
violent exercise, caffeine,

21:19.552 --> 21:21.888
acupuncture, marijuana,

21:22.013 --> 21:26.518
percodan, midrin, tenormen,
sanser, homeopathics...

21:29.187 --> 21:30.980
No results.

21:33.358 --> 21:35.276
No results.

21:51.501 --> 21:53.920
Euclid crashed.

21:54.045 --> 21:57.882
- I lost all my data, hardware.
- Your mainframe?

21:57.966 --> 21:59.008
Burnt.

21:59.484 --> 22:00.777
What... What's happened?

22:00.944 --> 22:04.156
First, I get
these crazy low picks,

22:04.281 --> 22:07.409
then it spit out
this string of numbers.

22:07.534 --> 22:10.954
I never saw anything like it.
And then it fries.

22:11.079 --> 22:13.749
- It crashed.
- You have a print out?

22:13.832 --> 22:16.376
- Of what?
- Of the picks, the number?

22:16.501 --> 22:19.880
- I threw it out.
- What number did it spit out?

22:20.005 --> 22:22.257
I don't know,
a string of digits.

22:22.382 --> 22:24.968
- How many?
- I don't know.

22:25.093 --> 22:30.515
What is it, 100, 1 ,000, 216?
How many?

22:30.640 --> 22:32.768
Probably around 200. Why?

22:33.727 --> 22:37.397
I dealt with some bugs
back in my Pi days.

22:37.564 --> 22:40.442
I wondered
if it was like one I ran into.

22:40.567 --> 22:42.778
Have you met Archimedes?

22:44.446 --> 22:47.115
The one with black spots. See?

22:48.617 --> 22:51.453
You remember
Archimedes of Syracuse? Eh?

22:52.996 --> 22:57.667
The king asks Archimedes
to determine if a present

22:57.793 --> 23:01.004
he has received
is actually solid gold.

23:01.129 --> 23:03.173
Unsolved problem at the time.

23:03.298 --> 23:06.718
It tortures the great Greek
mathematician for weeks.

23:06.843 --> 23:10.847
Insomnia haunts him and he
twists and turns in his bed

23:10.972 --> 23:16.353
for nights on end. Finally,
his equally exhausted wife,

23:16.478 --> 23:19.356
forced to share a bed
with this genius,

23:19.481 --> 23:24.569
convinces him
to take a bath, to relax.

23:24.694 --> 23:30.826
While he's entering the tub,
he notices the bath water rise.

23:30.951 --> 23:36.415
Displacement -
a way to determine volume,

23:36.540 --> 23:39.876
and thus a way
to determine density.

23:40.001 --> 23:46.258
Weight over volume. And thus
Archimedes solves the problem.

23:46.383 --> 23:49.553
He screams "Eureka!"
and he is so overwhelmed,

23:49.678 --> 23:53.098
he runs naked through the
streets to the king's palace

23:53.223 --> 23:55.559
to report his discovery.

23:57.352 --> 24:01.356
Now, what is the moral
of the story?

24:03.567 --> 24:05.402
That a breakthrough will come.

24:05.527 --> 24:10.240
Wrong! The point of the story
is the wife.

24:10.365 --> 24:12.868
Listen to your wife,
she'll give you perspective.

24:12.993 --> 24:14.995
Meaning, you need a break.

24:15.120 --> 24:18.331
You must take a bath
or you'll get nowhere.

24:18.457 --> 24:21.918
There will be no order,
only chaos.

24:24.004 --> 24:28.508
Go home, Max,
and you take a bath.

25:03.960 --> 25:07.422
Excuse me.
Can I take a look at the paper?

25:16.515 --> 25:18.934
Oh, my God.

25:26.233 --> 25:28.652
Six and a half.

25:28.735 --> 25:30.070
Hey...

25:31.988 --> 25:32.906
Hey!

25:33.031 --> 25:34.324
The paper, please.

26:20.912 --> 26:26.918
Mr Cohen? Perfect timing.
I was going to head home.

26:27.043 --> 26:30.255
- Who are you?
- Marcy Dawson. We were meeting.

26:30.380 --> 26:31.298
It's really not...

26:31.423 --> 26:34.384
It's such a pleasure
to finally meet you.

26:34.509 --> 26:36.178
- I studied your paper...
- Excuse me.

26:36.303 --> 26:38.472
- Let's take my car.
- I can't.

26:38.597 --> 26:39.473
Mr Cohen...

27:11.605 --> 27:13.607
Yes!

27:29.998 --> 27:34.545
I just threw out something.
I didn't realise I needed it.

27:34.670 --> 27:38.507
Just a print-out.
I lost my data.

27:48.600 --> 27:52.646
Whoa! I'm sorry. Max.
How're you doing? Lenny Meyer.

27:52.771 --> 27:55.107
- Where you going?
- Up there.

27:55.232 --> 27:58.193
You got five minutes?
Do you wanna try Tefillin?

27:58.318 --> 28:01.864
- Not now.
- I've a car to go to the Shul.

28:01.989 --> 28:04.700
- You got a car?
- That's my friend, Ephraim.

28:07.536 --> 28:08.746
- Let's go.
- Great.

28:10.789 --> 28:12.458
When you said you're Max Cohen,

28:12.499 --> 28:15.210
I didn't realise
you were the Max Cohen.

28:15.335 --> 28:19.673
Your work's revolutionary.
It's inspired the work we do.

28:19.798 --> 28:22.760
- It has?
- Very much so.

28:22.885 --> 28:27.431
The only difference is, we're
not looking at the stock market.

28:27.556 --> 28:29.516
Go ahead.
Wrap that round your hand.

28:29.641 --> 28:32.311
We're searching for a pattern
in the Torah.

28:32.436 --> 28:34.772
- What kind?
- We're not sure.

28:34.897 --> 28:37.441
All we know is
it's 216 digits long.

28:37.566 --> 28:41.653
- OK, stand up, please, Max.
- 216?

28:41.779 --> 28:45.657
That's right. You've gotta
be quiet now. Stand up.

28:45.783 --> 28:48.786
- 216?
- Shh. This goes on your head.

28:48.911 --> 28:53.624
Look at me, Max. Right here.

28:53.791 --> 28:56.585
There you go.

28:58.837 --> 29:02.383
All right. Now, we'll say
a prayer together.

29:02.508 --> 29:06.845
Repeat after me: Shma Yisroel.

29:06.970 --> 29:09.848
- Shma Yisroel.
- Right.

29:09.973 --> 29:13.811
- Adenoi Eloihenu.
- Adenoi Eloihenu.

29:13.936 --> 29:17.731
- Adenoi Echod.
- Adenoi Echod.

29:20.359 --> 29:23.487
Now, what's up, Max?

29:23.612 --> 29:27.700
What is this 216 number, Sol?

29:27.825 --> 29:28.701
Excuse me?

29:28.826 --> 29:31.954
You asked me if I'd seen
a 216-digit number.

29:34.081 --> 29:37.292
Oh, yeah. You mean the bug.

29:37.376 --> 29:40.337
I ran into it working on Pi.

29:40.504 --> 29:45.134
- What do you mean ran into it?
- Max, what's this about?

29:45.259 --> 29:48.095
There are these religious Jews
I've been talking to.

29:48.220 --> 29:50.055
Religious Jews?

29:50.180 --> 29:52.224
Yeah, Hasids,
the guys with beards.

29:52.349 --> 29:53.267
I know them.

29:53.392 --> 29:57.312
I know one in a coffee shop.
He's a number theorist.

29:57.438 --> 29:59.648
The Torah is his data set.

29:59.773 --> 30:03.277
He says they're after
a 216-digit number in the Torah.

30:03.402 --> 30:06.905
Come on, it's just coincidence.

30:07.031 --> 30:08.490
There's something else, though.

30:08.991 --> 30:10.200
What?

30:10.325 --> 30:12.411
You remember those weird
stock picks?

30:12.536 --> 30:16.623
- Yesterday's stock picks? Yes.
- They were correct.

30:16.707 --> 30:20.753
I got two picks on the nose.
Smack on the nose, Sol.

30:22.463 --> 30:23.672
Something's going on.

30:24.798 --> 30:28.385
It has to do with that number.
There's an answer in it.

30:28.510 --> 30:33.432
Max... Come with me.

30:33.557 --> 30:36.226
The ancient Japanese
considered the Go board

30:36.352 --> 30:39.104
to be a microcosm
of the universe.

30:39.229 --> 30:44.360
Although, when it's empty,
it appears simple and ordered,

30:44.485 --> 30:48.614
the possibilities of gameplay
are endless.

30:48.739 --> 30:53.452
No two Go games are alike,
just like snowflakes.

30:53.577 --> 30:57.456
So, the Go board
actually represents

30:57.623 --> 31:03.379
an extremely complex
and chaotic universe.

31:03.504 --> 31:07.257
And that's the truth
of our world, Max.

31:07.383 --> 31:10.427
It can't be
easily summed up with math.

31:10.552 --> 31:13.639
There is no simple pattern.

31:13.764 --> 31:17.101
But as the game progresses, the
possibilities become smaller.

31:17.226 --> 31:20.354
The board takes on order.
Soon, every move's predictable.

31:20.479 --> 31:21.438
So?

31:21.563 --> 31:25.317
So maybe, even though
we're not aware of it,

31:25.442 --> 31:31.323
there is a pattern, an order
underlying every Go game.

31:31.448 --> 31:34.702
Maybe it's like the pattern
in the stock market?

31:34.827 --> 31:37.705
The Torah? This 216 number?

31:37.788 --> 31:40.499
- It's insanity.
- Maybe it's genius.

31:40.666 --> 31:44.461
- I must get that number.
- Hold on! You're losing it.

31:44.586 --> 31:47.840
You have to breathe.
Listen to yourself.

31:47.965 --> 31:52.344
You're connecting my computer
bug with one you might've had

31:52.469 --> 31:54.680
and some religious hogwash.

31:54.805 --> 32:00.019
If you want the number 216,
you can find it everywhere.

32:00.144 --> 32:03.313
216 steps from your street
corner to your front door,

32:03.439 --> 32:08.360
216 seconds
you spend in the elevator

32:08.485 --> 32:10.779
When your mind becomes obsessed

32:10.904 --> 32:15.117
you filter everything else out
and find that thing everywhere.

32:15.242 --> 32:18.787
320, 450, 22, whatever.

32:18.912 --> 32:24.251
You've chosen 216 and you'll
find it everywhere in nature.

32:24.418 --> 32:26.837
But, Max,

32:26.962 --> 32:30.924
as soon as you discard
scientific rigour,

32:31.050 --> 32:34.053
you are no longer
a mathematician,

32:34.178 --> 32:36.346
you're a numerologist.

32:40.017 --> 32:40.768
Mr Cohen?

32:40.893 --> 32:41.852
Mr Cohen...

32:41.977 --> 32:44.897
God damn it! I'm sick
of you following me.

32:45.022 --> 32:48.817
I'm not interested in money.
I want to understand our world.

32:48.942 --> 32:51.070
I don't deal with materialists
like you.

32:51.195 --> 32:54.448
I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.

32:54.173 --> 32:56.550
I admit
we've been too aggressive.

32:56.676 --> 33:00.638
But all I ask is that
you give me five minutes.

33:00.721 --> 33:04.725
- As a token, accept this.
- I don't want your money.

33:04.892 --> 33:09.772
The suitcase isn't filled
with 50s, or gold, or diamonds.

33:09.897 --> 33:12.400
Just silicon. A Ming Mecca chip.

33:12.525 --> 33:16.028
Ming Mecca? They're not even
de-classified yet.

33:16.153 --> 33:20.533
You're right, they're not. But
Lancet-Percy has many friends.

33:21.993 --> 33:23.077
Beautiful, isn't it?

33:23.202 --> 33:25.621
Do you know how rare these are?

33:27.123 --> 33:28.374
What do you...?

33:30.751 --> 33:32.628
Mr Cohen?

33:32.753 --> 33:35.172
- Are you OK?
- No.

33:35.298 --> 33:38.759
Mr Coh... Sir, are you sick?

34:35.315 --> 34:37.318
Hey!

37:13.265 --> 37:16.102
C'mon, buddy. Get up.

37:16.185 --> 37:19.188
It's Coney lsland, last stop.

37:19.313 --> 37:22.650
Here. For your nose.

40:59.909 --> 41:03.371
Jenna, come back! Jenna!

41:04.747 --> 41:07.583
Jenna, come back here.

41:22.264 --> 41:25.768
- Farrouhk?
- No, it's Max, from next door.

41:28.121 --> 41:30.790
Max. Is everything all right?

41:30.873 --> 41:34.043
- Do you have any iodine?
- Did you cut yourself?

41:34.168 --> 41:36.379
No, it's to stain a slide.

41:36.504 --> 41:39.549
Ah. Science.
The pursuit of knowledge.

41:42.385 --> 41:45.054
One second.

41:45.138 --> 41:49.225
You surprised me.
I thought you were Farrouhk.

41:50.977 --> 41:52.979
Here we are.

41:53.104 --> 41:57.525
What are you examining?
A potato?

41:58.860 --> 42:01.613
No. Just something
for my computer. Thanks.

43:00.171 --> 43:02.423
- Shalom.
- Lenny, it's Max Cohen.

43:02.549 --> 43:04.968
Max. What're you doing now?

43:05.093 --> 43:08.137
I was thinking about
our conversation last night.

43:08.263 --> 43:11.099
- That's good.
- I wanna help.

43:16.521 --> 43:19.065
4:42. New evidence.

43:21.442 --> 43:23.903
Remember Pythagoras.

43:24.028 --> 43:29.576
Mathematician, cult leader.
Athens, circa 500 BC.

43:29.659 --> 43:34.497
Major belief: The universe
is made of numbers.

43:34.622 --> 43:37.292
Major contribution:

43:37.375 --> 43:40.420
The golden ratio.

43:42.171 --> 43:46.259
Best represented geometrically
as the golden rectangle.

43:46.384 --> 43:48.887
Visually, there exists
a graceful equilibrium

43:49.012 --> 43:50.638
between its length and width.

43:51.764 --> 43:56.644
When it's squared, it leaves a
smaller golden rectangle behind,

43:56.769 --> 43:59.230
with the same unique ratio.

43:59.355 --> 44:03.818
The squaring can continue,
smaller and smaller,

44:03.943 --> 44:05.153
to infinity.

44:38.478 --> 44:41.272
11:18. More evidence.

44:41.397 --> 44:45.735
Remember da Vinci. Artist,
inventor, sculptor, naturalist.

44:45.860 --> 44:48.446
ltaly, C15th.

44:48.571 --> 44:51.282
Rediscovered the perfection
of the golden rectangle

44:51.449 --> 44:55.453
and pencilled it
into his masterpieces.

44:55.578 --> 44:59.582
Connecting a curve through the
concentric golden rectangles,

44:59.707 --> 45:03.628
You generate the mythical
golden spiral.

45:03.753 --> 45:06.965
Pythagoras loved this shape,
for he found it in nature -

45:07.090 --> 45:10.677
a nautilus shell, rams' horns,
whirlpools, tornadoes,

45:10.802 --> 45:15.098
our fingerprints, our DNA
and even our Milky Way.

45:15.932 --> 45:17.976
9:22. Personal note.

45:18.101 --> 45:20.478
When I was a little kid,

45:20.603 --> 45:23.856
my mother told me
not to stare into the sun.

45:23.982 --> 45:26.109
So once, I did.

45:26.234 --> 45:28.486
At first, the brightness
was overwhelming,

45:28.611 --> 45:31.489
but I kept looking,
forcing myself not to blink.

45:31.614 --> 45:34.242
And then the brightness
began to dissolve.

45:34.325 --> 45:39.247
My pupils shrank to pinholes
and everything came into focus.

45:39.372 --> 45:42.166
And for a moment I understood.

45:42.292 --> 45:46.337
My new hypothesis:
if we're built from spirals,

45:46.462 --> 45:48.756
while living in a giant spiral,

45:48.882 --> 45:53.386
then everything we do
is infused with the spiral.

45:59.851 --> 46:02.103
10:15.

46:02.228 --> 46:05.815
Personal note.

46:05.940 --> 46:10.278
lt's fair to say
I'm stepping out on a limb.

46:10.403 --> 46:13.281
But I'm on the edge
where it happens.

46:13.364 --> 46:15.617
I'm happy you...

46:15.867 --> 46:19.203
Look, what do you want
in exchange for the chip?

46:19.287 --> 46:22.415
You tech' guys.
I think you know what we want.

46:22.540 --> 46:27.003
- I may not find anything.
- We'll take the risk.

46:27.128 --> 46:29.839
First, I want you
to call off the surveillance.

46:29.964 --> 46:31.466
Done. Anything else?

46:31.591 --> 46:36.804
Yeah, I'm a very private person.
Just knock on my door

46:36.930 --> 46:40.266
and leave the suitcase outside.
I don't wanna talk to anybody.

46:40.391 --> 46:44.229
- How do I know you're home?
- I'll knock back.

46:57.992 --> 47:03.164
- The Torah.
- Coffee.

47:04.666 --> 47:06.668
What is it?

47:06.793 --> 47:09.629
In Hebrew,
characters and numbers.

47:09.754 --> 47:13.841
No, the 216 number. What is it?

47:13.967 --> 47:16.219
I don't know.

47:16.344 --> 47:20.431
If you can find it,
maybe we can figure it out.

47:20.557 --> 47:26.521
- Can you really find it?
- If it's there, I'll find it.

47:55.800 --> 47:57.302
Max.

47:57.427 --> 47:59.429
Jenna.

47:59.554 --> 48:02.056
- Can we do it?
- Not now.

48:02.181 --> 48:03.474
Please, Max?

49:13.169 --> 49:16.005
Happy birthday, Euclid.

49:43.950 --> 49:47.704
18:30. Press return.

51:12.789 --> 51:15.375
18:33. Press return.

52:10.513 --> 52:13.182
Hell!

52:13.266 --> 52:16.311
You fuck! You fuck!

52:28.072 --> 52:30.491
Fuck!

52:45.590 --> 52:47.217
Fuck!

53:01.064 --> 53:04.108
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

53:04.234 --> 53:06.736
Fuck you!

55:08.316 --> 55:11.361
Yes, hello?

55:11.486 --> 55:14.572
He's busy right now, I'm sorry.

55:18.993 --> 55:21.496
You were screaming.

55:21.579 --> 55:26.125
Who said you could
put locks on the door, Mr Cohen?

55:29.295 --> 55:31.714
Are you OK?

55:36.052 --> 55:39.180
You're out, you hear me?
Out of here!

55:39.305 --> 55:42.016
- I've had it with you!
- Get out!

55:42.141 --> 55:44.894
Let's go.

55:45.019 --> 55:48.439
God damn it, no! You're the one
out of here, mister.

55:48.565 --> 55:49.566
Get out!

55:49.691 --> 55:52.068
Get out! Get out!

55:52.193 --> 55:54.070
Get out!

55:56.739 --> 55:58.199
Are you OK?

55:58.992 --> 55:59.951
Get out!

58:34.114 --> 58:36.116
You bastard.

59:18.742 --> 59:20.661
Nineteen and a half.

59:21.954 --> 59:23.455
Thirty-nine and an eighth.

59:25.290 --> 59:27.000
Six and three quarters.

59:29.545 --> 59:30.837
Seven and an eighth.

59:32.673 --> 59:34.174
Twelve and a quarter.

59:37.886 --> 59:40.931
I know these numbers.

59:48.105 --> 59:52.901
They're going down...
down...down.

59:53.026 --> 59:54.736
You lied to me.

59:57.030 --> 59:58.282
You have it?

01:00:03.829 --> 01:00:06.498
OK, sit down.

01:00:07.624 --> 01:00:13.547
I gave up before I pinpointed
it, but my guess is that...

01:00:13.672 --> 01:00:18.677
certain problems cause computers
to get stuck in a loop.

01:00:18.802 --> 01:00:24.183
The loop leads to meltdown,
but just before they crash

01:00:24.308 --> 01:00:29.855
they become aware
of their own structure.

01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:34.902
The computer has a sense
of its own silicon nature

01:00:35.027 --> 01:00:38.447
and it prints out
its ingredients.

01:00:39.573 --> 01:00:42.492
The computer becomes conscious?

01:00:42.618 --> 01:00:47.706
In... In... some ways...
I guess.

01:00:50.417 --> 01:00:54.463
Studying the pattern
made Euclid conscious of itself.

01:00:54.630 --> 01:00:59.134
It died spitting out the number.
Consciousness is the number?

01:00:59.259 --> 01:01:02.346
No, Max. It's only a nasty bug.

01:01:02.471 --> 01:01:05.933
- It's more than that.
- No. It's a dead end!

01:01:06.058 --> 01:01:10.062
- There's nothing there!
- It's a door, Sol. A door.

01:01:10.187 --> 01:01:13.440
A door to a cliff, you're
driving yourself over the edge.

01:01:13.565 --> 01:01:16.652
- You need to stop.
- You were afraid.

01:01:16.777 --> 01:01:19.363
- That's why you quit.
- I got burnt.

01:01:19.488 --> 01:01:21.657
- Come on.
- It caused my stroke!

01:01:21.782 --> 01:01:26.328
That's bullshit! It's
mathematics, numbers, ideas.

01:01:26.453 --> 01:01:29.248
Mathematicians
should go to the edge.

01:01:29.373 --> 01:01:32.084
- You taught me that.
- It's death!

01:01:32.251 --> 01:01:34.002
You can't tell me what it is.

01:01:34.169 --> 01:01:37.172
You've retreated to your Go
and books and goldfish.

01:01:37.256 --> 01:01:38.298
Max, go home.

01:01:38.423 --> 01:01:40.342
- You're not satisfied.
- Go home. Get out...

01:01:40.467 --> 01:01:41.677
I'm gonna see it!

01:01:41.802 --> 01:01:44.555
- Get out!
- I'm gonna understand it.

01:02:01.572 --> 01:02:02.614
Hey!

01:02:08.287 --> 01:02:09.079
Hey!

01:02:15.544 --> 01:02:16.503
Hey!

01:03:22.986 --> 01:03:26.365
- Who are you working for?
- Me.

01:03:26.490 --> 01:03:28.742
- Who sent you?
- I'm a student.

01:03:28.867 --> 01:03:31.828
- Gimme that.
- I've an assignment for class.

01:03:33.539 --> 01:03:34.665
Leave me alone.

01:03:48.554 --> 01:03:54.768
- Marcy. What's the matter?
- Let's go for a ride, Max.

01:03:54.893 --> 01:03:56.687
I can't. I have work.

01:03:58.689 --> 01:04:02.192
We had a deal, Max.
Now, let's get in the car.

01:04:02.317 --> 01:04:06.321
- Don't ever touch me!
- Max! Max!

01:04:06.446 --> 01:04:07.781
- Help!
- Max.

01:04:09.408 --> 01:04:12.494
- Leave me alone!
- Max, come here.

01:04:12.619 --> 01:04:16.540
Max. Where're you going, Max?
Stop, Max!

01:04:16.665 --> 01:04:19.418
- Max! God damn it!
- Help! Help!

01:04:21.044 --> 01:04:21.962
Help!

01:04:23.046 --> 01:04:24.840
- Get him!
- I got him.

01:04:24.965 --> 01:04:26.300
Come here, Max.

01:04:28.844 --> 01:04:29.970
Get outta here.

01:04:48.071 --> 01:04:51.950
- Where'd he go?
- He's over there.

01:05:05.297 --> 01:05:06.548
Max.

01:05:06.673 --> 01:05:09.426
Leave me alone!

01:05:09.551 --> 01:05:12.596
- I got him.
- Get off of me!

01:05:12.721 --> 01:05:16.600
- Help me! Help!
- Get over here!

01:05:19.144 --> 01:05:23.190
- Sit down and shut the hell up.
- Calm down.

01:05:23.315 --> 01:05:27.277
Didn't your mother ever tell you
not to play with matches?

01:05:27.402 --> 01:05:29.112
The market's going to crash.

01:05:29.238 --> 01:05:32.991
I didn't do anything.
I don't play the market.

01:05:33.825 --> 01:05:36.203
Be careful where you throw out
your trash.

01:05:36.620 --> 01:05:38.830
How could you do that?

01:05:38.997 --> 01:05:43.710
You gave faulty information.
You dangled the carrot,

01:05:43.794 --> 01:05:46.505
but only gave us
part of the code.

01:05:46.672 --> 01:05:49.049
Now give us the rest
to set it right.

01:05:49.174 --> 01:05:51.718
You bastards!
How could you be so stupid?

01:05:51.843 --> 01:05:55.430
Max, you just don't get it.

01:05:55.556 --> 01:06:00.811
I don't give a shit about you,
just what's in your head!

01:06:00.936 --> 01:06:05.774
If you won't help us, we'll
comply with the laws of nature.

01:06:05.899 --> 01:06:10.404
Survival of the fittest -
and we've got the fucking gun!

01:06:11.572 --> 01:06:15.117
- Max! Come here!
- Lenny? Lenny!

01:06:15.242 --> 01:06:19.246
- Hey!
- C'mon, get in here. Hurry!

01:06:19.371 --> 01:06:21.331
Stay down! Stay down.

01:06:22.124 --> 01:06:23.417
We've been looking for you.

01:06:23.542 --> 01:06:26.461
- What's going on?
- You have the number?

01:06:26.545 --> 01:06:28.672
What's going on? What is it?

01:06:30.173 --> 01:06:32.009
What're you doing?
Get off of me!

01:06:32.134 --> 01:06:33.552
Where's the number?

01:06:33.677 --> 01:06:36.430
It's not on me. It's in my head.

01:06:36.555 --> 01:06:39.766
You memorised it?
Did you give it to them?

01:06:39.892 --> 01:06:42.060
- Who?
- Those Wall Street bastards.

01:06:42.186 --> 01:06:44.521
- What do you care?
- Answer me.

01:06:46.648 --> 01:06:49.443
Listen. This is really big.

01:06:49.568 --> 01:06:52.821
I don't wanna hurt you.
Did you give it to them?

01:06:52.946 --> 01:06:55.490
They've got part of it. Let go!

01:06:55.616 --> 01:06:58.035
Damn it!

01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:00.120
- They're using it.
- Using what?

01:07:00.245 --> 01:07:03.373
Shut up! Impetuous little runt!

01:07:03.498 --> 01:07:06.585
- Let go!
- No, don't!

01:07:47.527 --> 01:07:49.529
Max.

01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:52.282
Max.

01:07:53.074 --> 01:07:55.076
Max.

01:07:56.035 --> 01:07:57.036
Max.

01:07:59.247 --> 01:08:00.749
You're all right.

01:08:02.792 --> 01:08:06.671
I'm Rabbi Cohen.
Cohen, like you.

01:08:08.423 --> 01:08:12.510
I'm sorry for what Lenny did.
He's been reprimanded.

01:08:12.635 --> 01:08:16.598
It's not our way. Are you OK?

01:08:16.723 --> 01:08:18.767
Yeah.

01:08:21.728 --> 01:08:26.064
Max, you have
to give us the number.

01:08:28.026 --> 01:08:30.528
What is it?

01:08:34.698 --> 01:08:37.660
The Talmud tells us
it began 2,000 years ago,

01:08:37.786 --> 01:08:39.953
when the Romans destroyed
the second temple.

01:08:40.078 --> 01:08:42.624
What is this?

01:08:42.749 --> 01:08:45.877
Max, you'll understand
if you listen.

01:08:46.002 --> 01:08:49.464
The Romans also destroyed
our priesthood, the Cohanim.

01:08:49.589 --> 01:08:53.885
And with their deaths, they
destroyed our greatest secret.

01:08:54.010 --> 01:08:57.889
In the centre of the temple
was the heart of Jewish life,

01:08:58.014 --> 01:09:00.975
the holy of holies.

01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:05.438
It was the earthly residence
of our God.

01:09:05.563 --> 01:09:09.067
The one God.

01:09:09.149 --> 01:09:11.444
It housed the Ark
of the Tabernacle,

01:09:11.611 --> 01:09:14.363
which stored the original 10
Commandments

01:09:14.488 --> 01:09:18.118
which God gave to Moses.

01:09:18.243 --> 01:09:22.580
Only one man was allowed
to enter this holy of holies

01:09:22.705 --> 01:09:27.001
on one day, the holiest day
of the year, Yom Kippur.

01:09:27.127 --> 01:09:28.877
On the Day of Atonement,

01:09:29.002 --> 01:09:31.046
all of lsrael
would descend upon Jerusalem

01:09:31.171 --> 01:09:35.176
to watch the High Priest,
the Cohen Godul,

01:09:35.301 --> 01:09:38.179
make his trip
to the holy of holies.

01:09:38.304 --> 01:09:42.475
If the High Priest was pure,
he would emerge moments later

01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:45.687
and we'd have a prosperous year.

01:09:45.812 --> 01:09:49.149
It meant we were one year closer
to the Messianic age.

01:09:49.274 --> 01:09:55.655
But, if he was impure,
he would die instantly

01:09:55.822 --> 01:09:59.784
and it meant we were doomed.

01:09:59.909 --> 01:10:03.246
The High Priest
had one ritual to perform there.

01:10:03.371 --> 01:10:06.207
He had to intone a single word.

01:10:06.332 --> 01:10:08.710
Yeah?

01:10:08.835 --> 01:10:12.922
That word was
the true name of God.

01:10:15.091 --> 01:10:16.468
So?

01:10:16.593 --> 01:10:20.472
The true name,
which only the Cohanim knew,

01:10:20.597 --> 01:10:23.641
was 216 letters long.

01:10:28.897 --> 01:10:31.733
Are you telling me that...

01:10:31.858 --> 01:10:36.613
That the number in my head
is the true name of God.

01:10:36.696 --> 01:10:40.074
Yes! It's the key
to the Messianic age.

01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:43.036
It will take us closer
to the Garden of Eden.

01:10:43.161 --> 01:10:45.997
As the temple burnt,
the Talmud tells us

01:10:46.122 --> 01:10:48.625
the High Priest
walked into the flames.

01:10:48.750 --> 01:10:51.586
He took the key to the top
of the building,

01:10:51.711 --> 01:10:55.799
the heavens opened
and received the key

01:10:55.924 --> 01:10:58.968
from the priest's
outstretched hand.

01:10:59.094 --> 01:11:02.222
We have been looking
for that key ever since.

01:11:02.347 --> 01:11:06.184
And you may have found it.

01:11:08.394 --> 01:11:11.231
That's what happened.

01:11:14.692 --> 01:11:16.736
I saw God.

01:11:16.820 --> 01:11:22.283
No. You are not pure. You cannot
see God unless you are pure.

01:11:22.408 --> 01:11:25.787
No... I saw everything.

01:11:25.912 --> 01:11:31.126
You saw nothing, only a glimpse.
There's so much more.

01:11:31.251 --> 01:11:36.339
We can unlock the door
and show God we're pure again.

01:11:36.464 --> 01:11:40.510
You're not pure.
How are you pure? I found it!

01:11:40.635 --> 01:11:47.642
Who do you think you are?
You are only a vessel from God.

01:11:47.767 --> 01:11:50.478
You're carrying a delivery
meant for us!

01:11:50.687 --> 01:11:53.148
It was given to me.

01:11:53.273 --> 01:11:57.026
It's inside of me.
It's changing me.

01:11:57.110 --> 01:12:02.031
It's killing you! Because you
are not ready to receive it.

01:12:06.327 --> 01:12:09.372
It's just a number.

01:12:10.290 --> 01:12:14.169
I'm sure you've written down
every 216-digit number.

01:12:14.294 --> 01:12:17.380
You've translated all of them.

01:12:17.505 --> 01:12:22.135
You've intoned them all.
Haven't you?

01:12:22.260 --> 01:12:25.096
What's it gotten you?

01:12:25.221 --> 01:12:28.057
The number is nothing.

01:12:31.144 --> 01:12:34.063
It's the meaning.

01:12:34.189 --> 01:12:39.319
The syntax.
It's what's between the numbers.

01:12:41.446 --> 01:12:44.949
You haven't understood it.

01:12:45.074 --> 01:12:48.953
It's because it's not for you.

01:12:49.746 --> 01:12:53.083
I've got it. I've got it!

01:12:53.208 --> 01:13:00.340
I understand it. And I'm gonna
see it. Rabbi, I was chosen.

01:13:00.465 --> 01:13:03.968
17:13. Personal note.
Getting faster...

01:13:04.094 --> 01:13:08.807
You stare into space like that,
you could go blind.

01:13:08.932 --> 01:13:12.060
What can the eyes
do without the brain?

01:13:17.899 --> 01:13:20.360
14:50.

01:13:23.613 --> 01:13:26.032
15:10.

01:13:27.367 --> 01:13:29.786
16:55.

01:13:30.161 --> 01:13:32.580
10:35.

01:13:32.705 --> 01:13:36.126
Already, I'm beginning to see.

01:13:40.755 --> 01:13:42.966
Can I help you?

01:13:43.091 --> 01:13:45.093
Sol?

01:13:45.218 --> 01:13:47.637
Were you a friend?

01:13:47.762 --> 01:13:52.559
- What do you mean?
- He had a second stroke.

01:15:15.058 --> 01:15:18.103
No! No!

01:15:19.104 --> 01:15:21.106
No!

01:15:33.243 --> 01:15:37.330
Three! Five! Nine!

01:15:37.455 --> 01:15:41.167
Ten! Eight! Six! Five! Two!

01:16:17.537 --> 01:16:19.539
Five.

01:16:21.791 --> 01:16:23.793
Eight.

01:16:25.336 --> 01:16:27.338
Nine.

01:16:30.884 --> 01:16:32.886
Seven.

01:16:33.011 --> 01:16:37.766
No, Max. No.

01:16:38.183 --> 01:16:40.185
Six.

01:16:40.310 --> 01:16:43.354
Stay with me, Max.

01:16:46.441 --> 01:16:49.319
Max.

01:16:56.785 --> 01:16:58.495
No!

01:16:58.620 --> 01:17:02.499
It's all right.

01:17:04.542 --> 01:17:07.212
It's all right.

01:18:36.176 --> 01:18:40.805
17:22. Personal note.
When I was a little kid,

01:18:40.530 --> 01:18:43.617
my mother told me
not to stare into the sun.

01:18:47.245 --> 01:18:51.124
So once, when I was six,
I did.

01:19:17.192 --> 01:19:19.611
Max, Max. Look.

01:19:20.696 --> 01:19:23.115
Pretty, huh?

01:19:24.324 --> 01:19:27.369
Can we do it, Max? Can we?

01:19:28.078 --> 01:19:33.333
How about 255 times 183?

01:19:33.417 --> 01:19:36.294
I got it! What's the answer?

01:19:50.183 --> 01:19:53.228
I don't know. What is it?

01:19:53.353 --> 01:19:57.065
46,665. See?

01:20:03.238 --> 01:20:08.869
How about 748 divided by 238?

01:20:09.786 --> 01:20:13.665
I got it. What's the answer?

01:20:14.305 --> 01:20:20.301
