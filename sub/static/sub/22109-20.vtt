WEBVTT

00:03.003 --> 00:05.005
(shouts)

00:06.340 --> 00:08.342
(printers whirring)

00:10.444 --> 00:13.881
-Mmm. Jam.
-(printer beeping)

00:20.588 --> 00:21.389
(Homer yawns)

00:21.422 --> 00:23.491
(laughs)

00:23.524 --> 00:25.093
(footstep splashes)

00:25.126 --> 00:26.860
Okay, okay.

00:26.894 --> 00:29.197
The only explanation
is I'm still asleep,

00:29.230 --> 00:31.399
dreaming that
the house is flooded.

00:31.432 --> 00:34.168
What does it mean?
What does it mean?

00:34.202 --> 00:36.170
It probably means
you're under a lot of stress

00:36.204 --> 00:39.006
because this is not a dream
and the house is flooded.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.609
-D'oh!
-Cowabunga!

00:41.642 --> 00:43.777
(Marge humming)

00:43.811 --> 00:45.045
(gasps)

00:45.079 --> 00:46.847
MARGE: Oh, my God.
This is horrible!

00:46.880 --> 00:48.716
Although, I do like
the sofa better

00:48.749 --> 00:50.218
where the water's carrying it.

00:55.055 --> 00:57.725
How did this happen?

00:59.227 --> 01:01.195
Homie, I don't like
where the painting is.

01:01.229 --> 01:02.696
Maybe you're upset
about something else.

01:02.730 --> 01:03.731
Are you hungry?

01:03.764 --> 01:05.233
Why don't you make
some pork chops?

01:05.266 --> 01:06.400
Fine.

01:06.434 --> 01:09.303
Now can you hang the painting?

01:09.337 --> 01:11.439
Always with the painting.

01:13.674 --> 01:15.943
MARGE:
Perfect. Wait, no, no, it's not.

01:15.976 --> 01:18.546
Try again.

01:18.579 --> 01:21.449
Mm. No, split the difference.

01:23.083 --> 01:24.885
See?

01:24.918 --> 01:28.756
When you listen to me,
we make a great team.

01:28.789 --> 01:31.759
It's almost like
I can hear the ocean.

01:31.792 --> 01:33.894
I guess we're both at fault.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.729
In a way, that's refreshing.

01:35.763 --> 01:37.831
Do you want me
to apologize anyway?

01:37.865 --> 01:40.934
-I'd be happy to.
-Aw, no, thanks, sweetie.

01:40.968 --> 01:43.837
HOMER: Hmm.
Well, either way, I'm sorry.

01:43.871 --> 01:46.407
Okay, now, when we try
to sell the house,

01:46.440 --> 01:48.576
no one mention the water.

01:48.609 --> 01:50.578
Just tell me
you paid the insurance.

01:50.611 --> 01:52.446
You mean that bill
that's floating right there?

01:52.480 --> 01:55.349
(laughs) It's not due
till tomorrow, so relax.

01:55.383 --> 01:58.586
My origami project.

01:58.619 --> 02:02.022
Don't worry, sweetie.
We'll have a funeral for it.

02:02.055 --> 02:04.024
GIL:
All right.

02:04.057 --> 02:07.861
I-I'll just pull up your policy.
Alt-Control-F-- Aw, damn it!

02:07.895 --> 02:10.097
Kate! Kate, can you get in here?

02:10.130 --> 02:13.467
It's a different generation that
knows how to work these things.

02:16.370 --> 02:18.606
-Enjoy.
-Eh, the kids, huh?

02:18.639 --> 02:21.275
They just know how to do it.
Now let's see here.

02:21.309 --> 02:22.943
(murmurs quietly)

02:22.976 --> 02:25.012
You're in luck!
The policy I sold you

02:25.045 --> 02:27.381
covers the full
replacement value of your house.

02:27.415 --> 02:28.616
(Homer whoops)

02:28.649 --> 02:31.819
We also pay for six months
temporary housing.

02:31.852 --> 02:34.655
Now the bad news: your policy
is the only one I've sold.

02:34.688 --> 02:36.224
It just cost
the company a bundle,

02:36.257 --> 02:37.991
and I'm gonna lose my job.

02:38.025 --> 02:39.960
Gee, sorry, ol' Gil.

02:39.993 --> 02:43.130
That's okay, I got options:
unemployment, suicide.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.466
When one door closes,
a coffin opens.

02:45.499 --> 02:48.302
Eh, what am I saying?
I don't make coffin money.

02:48.336 --> 02:50.638
But now I got something
to work towards!

02:50.671 --> 02:52.139
That's right.

02:52.172 --> 02:55.108
Kate, can you tell me
how to charge a cell phone?

02:56.944 --> 02:59.980
Whoa, whoa, whoa, so wall holes
make things charge?

03:00.013 --> 03:01.715
(laughs) What's next?

03:04.518 --> 03:07.355
There are some nice Airbnb
options on the Westside.

03:07.388 --> 03:10.090
Ooh. Huh? Huh?

03:10.123 --> 03:11.659
Mm, I'd feel kind of weird

03:11.692 --> 03:15.663
sleeping in the bedroom
of someone I know.

03:15.696 --> 03:17.998
Everything okay with the room?

03:18.031 --> 03:19.833
(shouts) You're not
supposed to be back

03:19.867 --> 03:21.669
from your vacation
for three weeks.

03:21.702 --> 03:23.371
It's not a vacation.

03:23.404 --> 03:25.506
My dad is doing
seasonal fruit picking.

03:25.539 --> 03:27.174
Come on, Milhouse.

03:27.207 --> 03:30.511
I need you on my shoulders
to reach the high apples.

03:30.544 --> 03:32.513
And I don't want to be in a room

03:32.546 --> 03:35.949
where guys walked around
with their dinguses out.

03:35.983 --> 03:38.686
No! No, don't imagine that!

03:38.719 --> 03:43.691
So, son, uh, word on the street
is you've come into some money.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.225
Yeah?

03:45.259 --> 03:48.462
I was wondering, you know, uh--
just hear me out--

03:48.496 --> 03:51.064
I've always considered you
a friend, and...

03:51.098 --> 03:53.066
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

03:53.100 --> 03:55.736
This is the most precious kind
of money there is:

03:55.769 --> 03:57.738
unearned, and it's mine.

03:57.771 --> 03:59.907
And you're not getting at it
just because you need

03:59.940 --> 04:02.310
a bigger TV or a room
with a window or...

04:02.343 --> 04:03.811
An operation.

04:03.844 --> 04:06.547
You need an operation?
What's the matter?

04:06.580 --> 04:08.316
If it's all the same,
it's embarrassing,

04:08.349 --> 04:10.384
and I'd rather not
discuss it publicly.

04:10.418 --> 04:11.885
Really? What could it be?

04:11.919 --> 04:14.822
Look, it's important to me
and pricey.

04:14.855 --> 04:16.624
What could it be?

04:19.360 --> 04:21.329
"Pane in the ass"?

04:21.362 --> 04:23.096
(buzzing)

04:23.130 --> 04:24.565
(imitates buzzer)
Hands off!

04:24.598 --> 04:26.233
I need professional help!

04:26.266 --> 04:28.769
Not to worry.
This is the United States.

04:28.802 --> 04:31.171
We have the third best
health care system

04:31.204 --> 04:32.573
in North America.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.174
Hi, Medicare!

04:34.207 --> 04:36.410
I mean, hi, every-money.

04:36.444 --> 04:38.679
Can I speak
with the doctor alone?

04:38.712 --> 04:41.081
Of course.

04:41.114 --> 04:43.250
Oh, wait, I'm the doctor.

04:43.283 --> 04:46.420
That's why I wear
the heart listening tube.

04:46.454 --> 04:48.456
Ba-boom, ba-boom.

04:48.489 --> 04:50.458
That never gets old.

04:50.491 --> 04:53.461
What's taking Grampa
so long in there?

04:53.494 --> 04:56.364
It's crazy that medical costs
are so high here.

04:56.397 --> 05:00.768
In Denmark-- to pick a country
at random-- health care is free.

05:00.801 --> 05:04.438
Free? Honey, nothing
is free but Splendas.

05:04.472 --> 05:07.508
In Denmark, they make everyone
pay high taxes.

05:07.541 --> 05:09.042
Even rich people.

05:09.076 --> 05:11.379
Yes, and they get
free health care.

05:11.412 --> 05:13.447
It's called socialism.

05:13.481 --> 05:17.217
Socialism? But all my radio
loudmouths tell me to hate that.

05:17.250 --> 05:19.387
That doc can't do
nothing for me.

05:19.420 --> 05:22.990
You know, if Grampa was in
Denmark and he had an accident,

05:23.023 --> 05:25.826
he'd get medical care for free!

05:25.859 --> 05:27.828
I can't go to Denmark by myself.

05:27.861 --> 05:30.297
I get lost in the middle
of a sentence,

05:30.330 --> 05:34.301
and that was the best pie
I ever had.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.804
Wait a minute. What if we used
our insurance money

05:36.837 --> 05:39.172
to take a family trip
to Denmark?

05:39.206 --> 05:40.841
Why would we want
to go to Denmark?

05:40.874 --> 05:44.011
It is the happiest country
on Earth, in poll after poll.

05:44.044 --> 05:47.648
I got your poll right here.

05:47.681 --> 05:48.982
Hey, you're right.

05:49.016 --> 05:51.184
Homer, you've got
the vacation coming.

05:51.218 --> 05:53.320
We've got the money.
It's settled.

05:53.353 --> 05:57.090
We're going to Denmark,
and Grampa will get fixed.

05:57.124 --> 06:00.528
Well, Homer, looks like
Marge is the boss in your house.

06:00.561 --> 06:02.362
Well, I say we don't go!

06:02.396 --> 06:04.231
But we need to go.
I'm desperate!

06:04.264 --> 06:05.699
Fine, we'll go.

06:05.733 --> 06:08.802
(laughs) That woman's got you
right under her thumb.

06:16.376 --> 06:18.111
DANISH MAN:
None of these were chosen

06:18.145 --> 06:20.448
as the name of our airline.
Danish Air.

06:20.481 --> 06:25.018
Excuse me, sir, the "no smoking"
sign has been illuminated.

06:25.052 --> 06:27.621
(electronic chiming)

06:27.655 --> 06:29.723
Sorry.

06:29.757 --> 06:32.526
The flight attendants
are so sweet.

06:32.560 --> 06:35.295
We will be landing
in Copenhagen shortly.

06:35.328 --> 06:37.798
If you have been designing
and building furniture

06:37.831 --> 06:41.669
during the flight, please apply
your final coat of varnish now.

06:43.604 --> 06:45.873
Hey, I got things done, too.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.875
GRAMPA:
What the...?!

06:47.908 --> 06:50.444
SOREN: Denmark,
the jewel of the Baltic.

06:50.478 --> 06:53.046
First-class schools,
sleek furniture design,

06:53.080 --> 06:54.414
energy independence,

06:54.448 --> 06:58.552
and brooding TV dramas
about teenagers getting killed.

06:58.586 --> 07:01.154
Thank you so much
for renting my apartment.

07:01.188 --> 07:02.956
It's so efficient.

07:06.927 --> 07:09.730
Please allow me to give you
a tour of Copenhagen.

07:09.763 --> 07:13.233
Wonderful. But first, a nap.

07:13.266 --> 07:16.504
No, Homer.
You slept on the plane.

07:16.537 --> 07:19.306
You slept through customs.
You slept on the bus.

07:19.339 --> 07:21.241
How can you sleep now?

07:21.274 --> 07:24.011
Don't you hear
Copenhagen calling?

07:24.044 --> 07:26.046
Take a message.

07:29.483 --> 07:31.485
*

07:35.789 --> 07:38.125
The people here are
so openly affectionate.

07:38.158 --> 07:39.693
Why don't we all hold hands?

07:39.727 --> 07:41.862
Are we supposed to
interlock fingers or not?

07:41.895 --> 07:43.330
Cramp! Cramp!

07:43.363 --> 07:44.865
Dad's hands
are covered with jam.

07:44.898 --> 07:47.300
-I can't get it off!
-Grampa's hands are too rough.

07:47.334 --> 07:49.603
-Lisa's hands are too soft.
-Just keep holding.

07:49.637 --> 07:51.539
Oh, don't worry,
the government will pay you

07:51.572 --> 07:53.106
to learn this social skill.

07:53.140 --> 07:55.375
Uh, Homer, you are
holding your own hand.

07:55.408 --> 07:59.212
They're fighting over a Danish.

07:59.246 --> 08:01.549
SOREN: Created in 1913,
The Little Mermaid

08:01.582 --> 08:03.951
is a world-famous icon
of Denmark.

08:03.984 --> 08:06.186
No, The Little Mermaid
was created by Disney,

08:06.219 --> 08:08.889
right before he created
Spider-Man and Star Wars.

08:08.922 --> 08:10.624
This is the real little mermaid.

08:10.658 --> 08:12.560
And she was
a very tragic figure.

08:12.593 --> 08:14.628
-What about her buddy, the crab?
-There was no crab!

08:14.662 --> 08:16.396
He was the only
funny thing in it.

08:16.429 --> 08:17.565
Got that right.

08:17.598 --> 08:19.399
Oh, my God, it's wonderful.

08:19.432 --> 08:21.802
More people biking
than driving cars.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.336
Yes, it's rush hour,

08:23.370 --> 08:25.973
so people are taking
the bicycle superhighways home.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.675
Uh, how crowded are
your bicycle superhighways?

08:27.708 --> 08:29.176
(chuckles):
Well...

08:29.209 --> 08:30.678
We don't have any.

08:30.711 --> 08:32.880
But how many people
ride bikes in your town?

08:32.913 --> 08:34.582
The paperboy, till Dad hit him.

08:34.615 --> 08:36.817
Sadly, the one headline
he couldn't deliver.

08:36.850 --> 08:39.186
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
stop the car!

08:40.754 --> 08:42.823
(Homer and Bart laugh)

08:42.856 --> 08:44.992
What? It's Danish for
"speed check."

08:45.025 --> 08:47.527
-Fart kontrol.
-(Homer and Bart laughing)

08:47.561 --> 08:49.262
(blows raspberries)

08:49.296 --> 08:50.764
(giggles)

08:50.798 --> 08:52.600
I apologize for my husband.

08:52.633 --> 08:54.835
In our language,
that sign means something else.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.336
Yes, I know.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.105
I'm speaking to you
in your language.

09:01.274 --> 09:04.712
"Non-Danes do not qualify
for the free health care.

09:04.745 --> 09:07.214
"But if you injure yourself
in Denmark,

09:07.247 --> 09:10.618
a Danish hospital
will treat you for free."

09:10.651 --> 09:14.354
(chuckles) I can't believe
the government puts this out.

09:14.387 --> 09:15.789
For free!

09:15.823 --> 09:17.557
(Homer and Grampa laugh)

09:17.591 --> 09:19.860
Excuse me, you dropped this.

09:19.893 --> 09:23.363
Lisa, this is Prince Christian,
second in line to the throne.

09:23.396 --> 09:26.366
*

09:26.399 --> 09:28.401
I play the tenor sax.

09:28.435 --> 09:30.470
Oh, no, here it comes.

09:30.503 --> 09:32.906
The fantasy about
becoming a princess

09:32.940 --> 09:35.042
that no girl can resist.

09:35.075 --> 09:37.077
*

09:52.525 --> 09:55.128
(trumpets playing fanfare)

09:55.162 --> 09:57.831
(dramatic soundtrack music
playing)

10:01.869 --> 10:04.004
Bart, get out of my fantasy!

10:04.037 --> 10:07.040
Ah, geez, I saved your life.
How about a "you're welcome"?

10:09.109 --> 10:10.944
Can you imagine
how exciting it would be

10:10.978 --> 10:12.512
to live in this city?

10:12.545 --> 10:14.948
Ooh, Mom, we could try it
for a semester.

10:14.982 --> 10:18.285
Do you know how long I've wanted
to live in a Celsius country?

10:18.318 --> 10:20.120
There's boobs on the billboards!

10:20.153 --> 10:23.423
And we're here in the world's
most perfect amusement park.

10:23.456 --> 10:26.126
(fireworks whistling, popping)

10:26.159 --> 10:27.427
(both gasp)

10:27.460 --> 10:29.462
(choir singing in Danish)

10:32.632 --> 10:35.602
Their national anthem
is so beautiful,

10:35.635 --> 10:38.271
and they don't get to war
until the second verse.

10:38.305 --> 10:41.942
And it's in a range
you can actually sing.

10:41.975 --> 10:47.380
* There is a lovely land *

10:47.414 --> 10:52.619
* With spreading
shady beech-trees *

10:52.652 --> 10:56.656
* Near salty eastern shore *

10:56.690 --> 11:03.396
* Near salty
eastern shore. *

11:05.265 --> 11:09.669
Bart and Lisa are getting along!
This country is calling to us.

11:09.703 --> 11:12.472
Homer, can you take
the daring step

11:12.505 --> 11:14.674
of doing nothing
and staying here?

11:14.708 --> 11:16.844
There are big reasons
why we can't live here.

11:16.877 --> 11:19.412
I'm okay with nuclear power,
but wind power?

11:19.446 --> 11:23.183
-Frankly, it sounds dangerous.
-Excuse me, white trash.

11:23.216 --> 11:25.685
Is this the kind of country
you want to live in?

11:25.719 --> 11:28.922
No, sir. I meant we separate
our trash by colors.

11:28.956 --> 11:34.527
* This country is still lovely *

11:34.561 --> 11:38.365
* Because blue is
the lake wind... *

11:38.398 --> 11:41.835
I can't believe you're talking
about leaving Springfield.

11:41.869 --> 11:44.037
That's where all my friends are.

11:47.707 --> 11:50.610
Look, everyone, we came here
to rip this country off,

11:50.643 --> 11:53.713
and that's what we're gonna do
and then go home.

11:53.747 --> 11:57.017
Fine. Let's find a place
that has good smorrebrod,

11:57.050 --> 12:01.354
or maybe some morbradbof
or flaeskesteg.

12:01.388 --> 12:03.023
Women do love this country.

12:03.056 --> 12:04.792
Homer, do you think
I'm handsome?

12:04.825 --> 12:07.194
Well, yes.
I was gonna mention it.

12:07.227 --> 12:10.363
-I am a Danish four.
-I'm an American nine.

12:10.397 --> 12:13.033
("America the Beautiful"
playing)

12:13.066 --> 12:15.568
How could my family
want to stay here?

12:15.602 --> 12:19.472
In America, we have great
TV channels, like BBC America,

12:19.506 --> 12:23.210
and a factory for cheesecakes--
a factory!

12:23.243 --> 12:26.146
Your enthusiasm makes me
want to follow you there.

12:26.179 --> 12:27.948
Foreigners are
no longer welcome.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.551
All right, Dad,
no more fooling around.

12:31.584 --> 12:34.554
Time to get you in the hospital,
so we can go home.

12:34.587 --> 12:36.589
*

12:56.443 --> 12:59.112
*

13:16.163 --> 13:18.866
Hello. How was your day?

13:18.899 --> 13:21.134
Eh. This country sure is safe.

13:21.168 --> 13:23.536
Well, last week,
an older tourist

13:23.570 --> 13:25.605
had a bad fall
at Kronborg Castle.

13:25.638 --> 13:29.442
Of course, Kronborg Castle.
Why didn't I think of it?

13:29.476 --> 13:31.778
Probably because
I never heard of it.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.813
TOUR GUIDE: Dating back
to the 15th century,

13:33.847 --> 13:36.549
Kronborg was immortalized
as Elsinore

13:36.583 --> 13:38.151
in Shakespeare's Hamlet.

13:38.185 --> 13:39.719
Isn't it beautiful?

13:39.752 --> 13:42.489
Yeah, the castle's okay,
but the keep is, like, meh.

13:42.522 --> 13:44.791
And I'll tell you something else
great about here.

13:44.824 --> 13:47.460
You've been walking so much,
you've lost weight.

13:47.494 --> 13:50.163
(gasps) I'm down to
my pre-pregnancy weight!

13:50.197 --> 13:53.133
Homer, in this most beautiful
spot on Earth,

13:53.166 --> 13:57.804
I have to admit to you,
I really don't want to go home.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.907
-I don't either.
-Let's stay.

13:59.940 --> 14:02.309
Think about how happy
we'd be here.

14:02.342 --> 14:06.846
It's healthy, it's clean,
it's incredibly civilized,

14:06.880 --> 14:09.682
and everything is done
in moderation.

14:09.716 --> 14:11.818
You're not describing a country.

14:11.851 --> 14:14.687
You're describing everything
that's the opposite of me.

14:14.721 --> 14:16.689
Everyone here speaks
perfect English.

14:16.723 --> 14:18.658
Probably gonna be around
in five years.

14:18.691 --> 14:21.694
It's just a nice place
and we like it.

14:21.728 --> 14:25.232
All I ask is that
you think about it.

14:27.700 --> 14:31.371
Maybe she's right.
Maybe we should move here.

14:33.206 --> 14:36.443
Tubby or not tubby,
that is the question.

14:36.476 --> 14:38.178
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind

14:38.211 --> 14:41.348
to gobble the wings and nachos
of outrageous portions,

14:41.381 --> 14:43.383
or just eat fish and end them.

14:43.416 --> 14:47.554
Ay, there's the rub--
brisket rub, Memphis rub.

14:47.587 --> 14:52.025
Oh, the rubs I'll miss when I
have shuffled off from Buffalo.

14:52.059 --> 14:53.860
Mozzarella-- No.

14:53.893 --> 14:56.696
I'm an American, and we've got
to get back to America,

14:56.729 --> 15:00.567
the greatest country on Earth,
1917 to 2016.

15:03.470 --> 15:06.539
This is the famous Holger
Danish, our sleeping king.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.041
All right, Dad, here we go.

15:08.075 --> 15:10.910
There's nothing more American
than a slip and fall.

15:12.412 --> 15:13.880
-(grunts)
-Whoa!

15:13.913 --> 15:15.382
Hold on, son.

15:15.415 --> 15:18.318
Before you push me down these
stairs, I have a confession.

15:18.351 --> 15:20.988
The procedure I need
isn't a surgery.

15:21.021 --> 15:23.923
I just need to remove
an old tattoo.

15:23.957 --> 15:26.893
You made us come here
because of a stupid tattoo?

15:26.926 --> 15:29.696
It's not just any tattoo.

15:31.864 --> 15:33.433
(gasps) Mom?

15:33.466 --> 15:38.071
No! Mona Malloy,
who used to iron my shirts.

15:38.105 --> 15:40.107
Of course it's your mother.

15:42.709 --> 15:45.778
I can't go to my grave
with this hanging over my heart.

15:45.812 --> 15:47.414
Why is it guys like us

15:47.447 --> 15:49.916
are always disappointing
the women we love?

15:49.949 --> 15:53.286
I would ask Mona, but she's
spending eternity hating me,

15:53.320 --> 15:54.921
from her pit in hell.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.623
I miss her, too.

15:56.656 --> 15:59.526
Her greatest skill was
making people miss her.

15:59.559 --> 16:01.428
(sobbing)

16:01.461 --> 16:04.031
-Hello.
-She's talking to you.

16:04.064 --> 16:06.766
Mm, I'll talk to someone my age.

16:06.799 --> 16:08.268
(chuckles)

16:08.301 --> 16:11.104
Excuse me.
I felt compelled to meet you.

16:11.138 --> 16:14.141
I've never met a man
with empathy so deep

16:14.174 --> 16:15.808
he weeps in public.

16:15.842 --> 16:17.944
Oh, yeah, I cry, I blubber.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.979
Sometimes stuff
comes out of my nose.

16:20.013 --> 16:21.981
Well... (sighs)

16:22.015 --> 16:24.784
Danish men never reveal
such emotion.

16:24.817 --> 16:27.154
They're like
cold, flawless gods.

16:27.187 --> 16:29.489
Look, lady, I'm a married man.

16:29.522 --> 16:32.125
-I'm a married man.
-Shh.

16:32.159 --> 16:33.793
(muffled):
I'm a married man.

16:33.826 --> 16:37.564
Here, marriage is not
such a sacred institution.

16:37.597 --> 16:40.133
Danes are very free sexually.

16:40.167 --> 16:44.337
Perhaps it's because we are more
sensitive to each other's needs,

16:44.371 --> 16:46.806
or just because
we're all so freaking hot.

16:46.839 --> 16:50.977
Now let us dance our
traditional dance of passion.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.379
Okay.

16:52.412 --> 16:54.414
-(lively Danish music playing)
-(excited shouting)

17:03.690 --> 17:07.827
Do you know the Danes eat more
ice cream than any other people?

17:07.860 --> 17:09.862
Yet their rate
of heart disease is--

17:09.896 --> 17:12.099
Oh, it's their number one
cause of death.

17:12.132 --> 17:13.800
Well, look where we got it.

17:15.368 --> 17:17.437
Well, that never
stopped your father.

17:17.470 --> 17:20.540
I'll just text a picture of you
right now, eating the ice--

17:20.573 --> 17:21.874
Oh, my God.

17:21.908 --> 17:24.077
(gasps) Marge.

17:26.079 --> 17:27.380
Where are you going?

17:27.414 --> 17:29.782
Where will I ever find
another man like you?

17:29.816 --> 17:32.852
Hi, we're the Kiwanis Club
of Cheeseburg, Ohio.

17:32.885 --> 17:36.389
(sighs):
Oh... hio.

17:37.390 --> 17:39.058
I must confess to you now,

17:39.092 --> 17:42.729
every couple that has Airbnb'd
my apartment has broken up.

17:42.762 --> 17:45.132
Then how did it get
so many good reviews?

17:45.165 --> 17:46.866
They like the big apartment cat.

17:46.899 --> 17:49.802
Oh, I do like it.
Ooh, let me scratch your chin!

17:49.836 --> 17:51.204
(purring)

17:51.238 --> 17:53.206
He's so chubby,
I just can't take it!

17:53.240 --> 17:55.074
Marge, honey, I'm so sorry.

17:55.108 --> 17:57.577
We shared a dance and a fish,
but that's it.

17:57.610 --> 18:00.580
-I understand. It's fine.
-So you're coming home?

18:00.613 --> 18:03.316
No, I'm not. I want to stay.

18:03.350 --> 18:07.053
I don't know for how long,
but I feel so alive and free.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.721
I've stopped wearing a bra.

18:08.755 --> 18:11.324
(gasps) That means
they're just one fabric away

18:11.358 --> 18:13.260
from the cool Scandinavian air.

18:13.293 --> 18:15.895
Sorry, Homie. We're not leaving.

18:15.928 --> 18:18.765
Well, the kids
can't just replace me.

18:18.798 --> 18:22.068
He's so cozy.
He can sleep with Mom.

18:22.101 --> 18:24.103
Can I get you a beer?

18:24.137 --> 18:26.173
(purring)

18:26.206 --> 18:28.275
(Homer groans)

18:31.110 --> 18:33.112
-Dad, wait.
-(gasps)

18:33.146 --> 18:36.283
Mom says you can take these home
with you. It's a bag of bras.

18:36.316 --> 18:40.052
And I just learned
how to unhook these.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.590
Oh, my God. What am I doing?

18:43.623 --> 18:45.592
I should be having
the time of my life

18:45.625 --> 18:48.928
in this airport security line,
but it's nothing without Marge.

18:48.961 --> 18:50.963
Son, I got
to tell you something.

18:50.997 --> 18:53.266
-You're making a huge mistake.
-I know.

18:53.300 --> 18:55.435
I let stubbornness
ruin my marriage,

18:55.468 --> 18:58.605
and all I have to show for it
is an old tattoo.

18:58.638 --> 19:01.708
-Go back to your woman.
-You mean the one in the bar?

19:01.741 --> 19:03.976
First the one in the bar,
then Marge.

19:04.010 --> 19:05.612
No! Just Marge.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.380
*

19:13.420 --> 19:16.055
-Marge!
-(gasps) You missed the flight.

19:16.088 --> 19:18.791
Marge, baby,
wherever you are is home.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.393
I'm staying in Copenhagen.

19:20.427 --> 19:22.061
I'm glad you came back,

19:22.094 --> 19:25.465
but I was kind of rethinking
living here.

19:25.498 --> 19:27.133
Why?

19:27.166 --> 19:29.068
The toilet's in the shower.

19:29.101 --> 19:30.670
The washing machine
won't even hold

19:30.703 --> 19:32.339
one pair of your underpants.

19:34.874 --> 19:38.177
And you see how dark it is?

19:38.211 --> 19:40.280
It's 11:00 in the morning.

19:42.682 --> 19:44.083
(yawns)

19:44.116 --> 19:47.019
Well, that was a nice day.

19:47.053 --> 19:49.422
I think I'm ready to go home.

19:49.456 --> 19:50.857
You got it, baby.

19:50.890 --> 19:52.825
We'll ditch this paradise
and never come back.

19:52.859 --> 19:54.160
What about the kids?

19:54.193 --> 19:56.563
I heard the schools are
really great here. I'm out.

19:56.596 --> 19:59.399
I want to stay,
but no one ever listens to me.

19:59.432 --> 20:01.033
So we're all united.

20:01.067 --> 20:02.669
-Yay!
-All right!
-Whoo!

20:02.702 --> 20:06.038
But I can't help thinking
I'm forgetting something.

20:08.308 --> 20:10.943
Sir, those birds were
already fed by the state.

20:10.977 --> 20:14.046
You are overfeeding them,
which will kill them.

20:14.080 --> 20:15.415
(Grampa grunts)

20:20.320 --> 20:24.457
When life gives you lemons,
you make lemonade.

20:24.491 --> 20:27.193
OTHERS:
Aw.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.028
So how much do we owe you?

20:29.061 --> 20:32.031
Nothing. In Denmark,
we have socialized tattooing.

20:32.064 --> 20:35.602
And with that, our country
is out of money. Good-bye.

20:42.074 --> 20:43.676
(panting)

21:29.121 --> 21:30.623
Shh!

21:34.026 --> 21:35.995
