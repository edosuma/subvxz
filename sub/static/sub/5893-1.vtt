SCOTT: What the fuck?

04:38.153 --> 04:39.325
Sorry.

04:40.947 --> 04:44.042
You'd think they'd be
too weak from not eating.

04:44.576 --> 04:47.045
Honestly, I hope
they starve to death.

04:47.537 --> 04:51.337

a fuck about the janitors.

the lawn at 9:00 on a Sunday?

The only thing those posers care
about is looking like they care.

07:10.013 --> 07:12.516
Why would they do that?
I mean, what's the point?

07:12.933 --> 07:15.027
The villages don't
consider them women

07:15.101 --> 07:16.648
unless they've
gone through this.

07:17.020 --> 07:20.024
From their perspective,
it's a rite of passage.

07:20.106 --> 07:21.107
It's insane.

07:21.191 --> 07:22.818
There's an ambassador
on East 44th Street

something about this.

07:24.945 --> 07:26.447

a lawyer at the UN.

involved somehow.

09:34.365 --> 09:35.537
There are procedures.

09:36.367 --> 09:37.584
We can't just go
invade a country

09:37.660 --> 09:38.860
because they're
doing something

09:38.912 --> 09:41.210
that we think is
illegal or immoral.

09:41.289 --> 09:42.290
Anymore.

09:44.209 --> 09:45.210
Where's your necklace?

09:46.002 --> 09:47.845
It's in my dorm room.

09:49.047 --> 09:50.970
Don't worry, it's safe.

09:51.216 --> 09:52.968
You know your mother made that
out of your grandmother's...

09:53.051 --> 09:56.681
Silver. Yes, I know.
I just forgot to wear it.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.310
You know,
you should've kept playing.

10:01.392 --> 10:02.518
Your mother loved it.

10:03.019 --> 10:05.397
She also loved it when
I did what made me happy.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.657
Playing used to
make you happy.

10:07.732 --> 10:10.326
It still does. But I'm
not going to be a flautist.

10:10.401 --> 10:12.028
It's not like I can
practice in my dorm room.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.113
And if I played
on the street,

10:13.196 --> 10:14.539
people would throw
change at me.

10:15.698 --> 10:17.496
Well, you were very talented.

10:18.076 --> 10:19.919
I like to think I still am.

10:19.994 --> 10:22.964
You are. I just think you're letting
your talents go to waste.

10:23.039 --> 10:26.714
Yeah. On books and college.
And terrible stuff.

10:27.252 --> 10:29.721
The two are not
mutually exclusive, my clear.

10:33.424 --> 10:35.893
Are you going to have
that cheese bread?

10:37.011 --> 10:38.308
Knock yourself out.

10:38.388 --> 10:39.640
Thanks.

10:46.896 --> 10:49.991
Have you ever had fantasies
of saving a dying tribe?

10:52.902 --> 10:56.031
Of protecting them from
encroaching civilization?

10:56.990 --> 10:58.958
Well, an opportunity
has come up

10:59.033 --> 11:01.252
to turn that fantasy
into reality.

11:01.578 --> 11:04.331
For those of you
who care enough to join us.

11:04.414 --> 11:08.669
In two weeks, an untouched
jungle in the Peruvian Amazon

11:08.751 --> 11:10.094
will be destroyed forever.

11:10.420 --> 11:12.548
And so will
the natives inside it.

11:12.630 --> 11:14.257
The companies
want the natural gas

11:14.340 --> 11:15.887
in the ground
under the villages.

11:16.426 --> 11:19.100
So they GPS the location,

11:19.179 --> 11:21.978
bulldoze the homes,
and kill the natives.

11:22.432 --> 11:27.529
Ancient tribes, seen only
in rare glimpses from satellite photos,

11:27.937 --> 11:30.031
will be gone forever.

11:33.109 --> 11:34.326
So what's the plan?

11:34.402 --> 11:36.162
March through the jungle
and starve yourself?

11:41.117 --> 11:42.494
You must be a freshman.

11:43.786 --> 11:45.914
Yes. Why?

11:46.289 --> 11:49.793
Because only a freshman
would speak with such insolence.

11:50.001 --> 11:51.127
You can leave now.

11:51.794 --> 11:53.888
I'm sorry. I didn't...
Go.

11:54.923 --> 11:56.596
I said I'm sorry.

12:12.649 --> 12:13.901
JONAH: Justine!

12:14.400 --> 12:17.244
Alejandro takes his social
work very seriously.

12:17.320 --> 12:18.663
You think?

12:18.738 --> 12:20.240
Sorry. I'll try
and talk to him.

12:20.448 --> 12:21.574
Don't bother!

12:22.116 --> 12:24.244
Anyway, thanks for coming!

12:24.327 --> 12:25.328
I mean it.

12:31.834 --> 12:33.381
(EXHALES)

13:04.867 --> 13:05.914
Hey.

13:07.787 --> 13:10.210
Look, I'm really sorry
about the other night.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.133
I didn't mean
to be so flip.

13:12.208 --> 13:13.209
Yes, you did.

13:13.459 --> 13:14.631
Save it.

13:14.711 --> 13:17.430
We need people who are
serious about making an impact.

13:17.505 --> 13:19.132
Not making jokes.
(SCOFFS)

13:19.215 --> 13:20.717
I am serious.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.428
You're a serious student,
which is fine,

13:23.511 --> 13:24.979
but it's really
not enough.

13:25.054 --> 13:27.398
Well, maybe if you gave
someone a chance to learn,

13:27.473 --> 13:30.317
your organization
might be more effective.

13:32.228 --> 13:34.731
What's the cause you
care about the most?

13:34.814 --> 13:36.407
I mean, they're
all important,

13:36.482 --> 13:38.655
but what keeps
you up at night?

13:39.193 --> 13:40.536
Women's rights in Africa.

13:41.738 --> 13:43.832
But how can a white
girl from the suburbs

13:43.906 --> 13:46.125
go to Africa and tell
a village that FGM is wrong?

13:46.409 --> 13:48.582
Exactly.
I'll tell you how.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.959
You organize a group
and you go there.

13:51.039 --> 13:52.791
And you get
media attention.

13:52.874 --> 13:54.547
Right or wrong,
you need cameras on them.

13:54.625 --> 13:57.595
That's the only way
people change their behavior.

13:57.670 --> 14:01.140
The threat of embarrassment.
You must shame them.

14:02.258 --> 14:03.305
Show me how.

14:05.053 --> 14:07.602
I think you're an
idealist, Justine,

14:07.680 --> 14:09.899
and you have
good intentions.

14:10.266 --> 14:12.189
But you're not
ready for this.

14:12.268 --> 14:14.612
I am. Let me prove it.

14:16.856 --> 14:20.656
ALEJANDRO: The villages
are here, here and here.

14:20.735 --> 14:23.955
The development is going here.
A few miles from the Yajes.

14:24.030 --> 14:27.000
Ten more miles and
the Yajes village is ruined.

14:27.075 --> 14:29.999
And that's the end of
unmanned civilization.

14:30.161 --> 14:32.163
Justine. Nice of you
to join us.

14:32.789 --> 14:33.790
Late.

14:34.165 --> 14:35.462
Sorry, I got off
at the wrong stop.

14:35.541 --> 14:36.758
It's okay.

14:36.834 --> 14:39.383
We leave Saturday.
We get in one day ahead.

14:39.462 --> 14:42.591
So when the bulldozers arrive,
they're in for a surprise.

14:42.673 --> 14:44.425
Who is behind
the development?

14:44.509 --> 14:46.887
It's a private
corporation in Peru.

14:46.969 --> 14:49.643
They hire ex-military to protect
them and to kill the natives.

14:49.722 --> 14:52.566
So we're going to take on a
private militia with our phones?

14:52.642 --> 14:55.521
No. But we're going
to scare them.

14:55.603 --> 14:57.480
And the Peruvian
Government will notice.

14:57.980 --> 15:01.951
Hi. Sorry. How are we
supposed to stream from the jungle?

15:02.026 --> 15:03.869
ALEJANDRO: They have a satellite.

15:03.945 --> 15:06.073
Our contact will
hack us in.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.954
I have 15 sites
ready to stream

15:09.033 --> 15:12.082
and an army of followers
to tweet when we're uploaded.

15:12.703 --> 15:14.876
Once the construction knows
they're on camera,

15:15.456 --> 15:17.254
everything changes.

15:17.792 --> 15:19.260
Just watch.

15:23.464 --> 15:24.761
Justine.

15:25.341 --> 15:28.470
Are you sure you're here
for the right reasons?

15:32.807 --> 15:33.899
Yeah.

15:34.767 --> 15:35.859
Good.

15:36.519 --> 15:40.194
Be careful. The jungle's
a dangerous place.

15:48.990 --> 15:50.116
KAYCEE: This is crazy.

15:50.199 --> 15:52.327
Are you going tree hugging

01:27:49.347 --> 01:27:50.599
My phone.

01:27:51.349 --> 01:27:52.851
Take my phone.

01:27:53.351 --> 01:27:54.694
It's in my...

01:27:55.061 --> 01:27:56.688
It's in my pocket.

01:28:00.108 --> 01:28:01.485
Take it.

01:28:01.610 --> 01:28:03.032
Let me get you.
No.

01:28:03.111 --> 01:28:04.158
Yes. Yes.

01:28:04.529 --> 01:28:07.078
Yes.
Justine, kill me.

01:28:08.283 --> 01:28:09.284
Kill me.

01:28:09.367 --> 01:28:10.789
Justine. Kill me...

01:28:10.869 --> 01:28:12.291
I... (STAMMERS)

01:28:12.370 --> 01:28:15.419
I can't. I'm gonna
get you out of here.

01:28:17.501 --> 01:28:18.718
Kill me.

01:28:19.211 --> 01:28:20.838
Please. Kill me...

01:28:28.678 --> 01:28:30.726
Justine! Let me
out of here!

01:28:30.806 --> 01:28:32.399
Please! Please
let me out of here!

01:28:37.854 --> 01:28:39.902
No! Justine,
don't leave me! Justine!

01:28:40.357 --> 01:28:42.075
Justine, please!

01:28:44.569 --> 01:28:46.617
Get me of here, Justine!

Are you sure
there's no one else?

01:32:43.975 --> 01:32:46.319
Yes. I'm sure.
Let's go.

01:33:12.670 --> 01:33:13.762
Hey!

01:33:16.174 --> 01:33:17.676
Help!

01:33:18.968 --> 01:33:22.017
I'm here! I'm still here!

01:33:44.536 --> 01:33:47.790
JUSTINE: <i>All the other students
were killed in the crash.</i>

01:33:48.373 --> 01:33:51.126
I stayed by the fire
as long as I could.

01:33:51.209 --> 01:33:53.928
But by the next day,
it had burned out.

01:33:55.380 --> 01:33:57.633
If it weren't
for those natives,

01:33:57.715 --> 01:33:58.841
I'd be dead, too.

01:34:00.844 --> 01:34:04.018
They heard the crash
and eventually they found me.

01:34:05.890 --> 01:34:09.064
They fed me
and guided me out of the jungle.

01:34:10.228 --> 01:34:12.071
They knew I was lost.

01:34:12.397 --> 01:34:15.401
That I had accidently
landed in their backyard.

01:34:19.779 --> 01:34:22.658
I never experienced
any anger or hostility.

01:34:24.367 --> 01:34:26.119
It was the opposite.

01:34:29.247 --> 01:34:32.091
I never felt afraid
when I was with them.

01:34:34.669 --> 01:34:36.091
Until the bulldozers
showed up

01:34:36.171 --> 01:34:38.640
and slaughtered
them like cattle.

01:34:43.219 --> 01:34:45.722
We're all very
proud of you, baby.

01:34:45.805 --> 01:34:47.728
You saved that village.

01:34:48.308 --> 01:34:49.776
DETECTIVE: These natives...

01:34:51.269 --> 01:34:53.692
The Yajes.
The Yajes. I'm sorry.

01:34:53.938 --> 01:34:56.316
Allegedly headhunters.
Cannibals.

01:34:56.482 --> 01:34:59.952
Did you ever see any of that sort
when you were there?

01:35:02.864 --> 01:35:04.366
Never once.

01:35:09.329 --> 01:35:10.581

Are you okay?

01:35:29.557 --> 01:35:32.026
