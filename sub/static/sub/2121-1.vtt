02:16.101 --> 02:17.769
Hello?

02:28.129 --> 02:29.927
Hello?!

02:32.494 --> 02:35.401
Hel... hello?!

02:47.279 --> 02:48.948
Hello?

02:51.295 --> 02:53.973
So, I got to ask...

02:54.043 --> 02:56.410
What do you really do for a living?

02:56.411 --> 02:58.018
What do you mean?

02:58.019 --> 03:00.866
Your profile says that
you do medical claims.

03:00.867 --> 03:03.473
You don't really do medical claims.

03:05.891 --> 03:09.936
- You really do medical claims?
- Yeah I really...

03:09.937 --> 03:11.835
I really do.

03:13.723 --> 03:16.010
What? Come on.

03:16.011 --> 03:17.868
No. I...

03:17.869 --> 03:19.196
No judgment.

03:19.197 --> 03:21.055
Okay, fine. Um...

03:21.056 --> 03:24.141
I used to want to...

03:24.142 --> 03:27.159
I used to want to be a
professional kickboxer.

03:27.160 --> 03:29.536
I take classes now, but...

03:29.537 --> 03:30.905
Kickboxing?

03:30.906 --> 03:32.253
Lame.

03:32.254 --> 03:33.942
It's... That's amazing.

03:33.943 --> 03:36.270
The sport of the future.

03:58.198 --> 04:01.394
Okay, I need to just breathe, uh...

04:01.395 --> 04:02.353
Okay.

04:02.354 --> 04:04.431
For a second.

04:04.432 --> 04:06.680
I like you.

04:09.607 --> 04:12.733
You are such a perv.
If I was having sex,

04:12.734 --> 04:16.500
do you really think I'd waste my
time answering your phone call?

04:16.500 --> 04:18.997
Fine. You're the queen of hook-ups.

04:18.998 --> 04:21.653
He wasn't a douchebag.
He was a gentleman.

04:21.654 --> 04:23.851
Oh, my God. You did
not just say that.

04:23.852 --> 04:25.911
You... you know what?
You're a whore.

04:25.912 --> 04:27.688
You're a gigantic whore.

04:27.689 --> 04:30.036
Well, I'm not like my
slut friend, am I?

04:30.037 --> 04:31.665
Hello?

04:39.987 --> 04:42.324
I'm gonna go.

04:43.733 --> 04:46.470
And thanks. Bye.

05:28.808 --> 05:30.626
- Aah!
- Aah!

05:31.495 --> 05:33.593
Stay there!

05:33.943 --> 05:35.791
Stay there.

05:38.928 --> 05:41.194
Who are you?

05:41.195 --> 05:43.553
My name's Sabrina.

05:45.241 --> 05:48.368
Whoa, whoa. Just stop!

05:55.131 --> 05:57.609
Where are we?

05:58.098 --> 06:00.236
I don't know.

06:02.464 --> 06:03.883
Whoa.

06:05.551 --> 06:08.758
Same thing happened to me.

06:08.947 --> 06:11.065
We're the same.

06:18.838 --> 06:21.825
- There's nothing.
- What?

06:22.004 --> 06:25.211
There's nothing back there.

06:27.329 --> 06:30.216
That's the only way out.

06:31.904 --> 06:32.972
What?

06:32.973 --> 06:35.950
That's the only way out.

06:38.798 --> 06:42.734
- S-stay... stay there.
- Okay.

07:22.074 --> 07:23.922
Hello?!

07:29.077 --> 07:30.845
Aah!

07:31.175 --> 07:33.393
No. No.

07:39.497 --> 07:41.295
Damn it.

07:41.994 --> 07:43.902
I'm sorry.

07:44.502 --> 07:46.150
What?

07:57.249 --> 08:01.765
Help! Help! She's
trying to kill me!

08:02.284 --> 08:04.162
Damn it!

08:05.231 --> 08:07.719
Hey! Hey!

08:08.138 --> 08:09.597
Hey!

08:10.815 --> 08:12.033
Fuck.

09:02.893 --> 09:05.541
Why are you doing this?

09:07.529 --> 09:10.676
Because we have to.

09:48.957 --> 09:50.666
Stop!

09:56.570 --> 09:58.348
Stop.

10:06.889 --> 10:08.638
Aaah!

10:13.453 --> 10:14.991
Stop.

11:45.371 --> 11:49.606
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

11:49.726 --> 11:51.335
Stop! Stop!

11:54.372 --> 11:55.700
Die!

11:58.757 --> 12:00.236
Die!

12:00.995 --> 12:02.613
Die!

12:39.197 --> 12:43.622
How many more do I have to kill?

12:46.040 --> 12:48.227
Can you hear me?!

12:48.228 --> 12:50.775
Please let me in.

12:56.060 --> 12:59.077
Just stay where you are, Sabrina.

13:07.868 --> 13:10.675
Don't even think about it.

15:17.398 --> 15:21.393
- Time for your announcements.
- I do love that part.

15:21.394 --> 15:22.832
Oh, Joseph.

15:22.833 --> 15:25.610
I do. Well, I love most of it.
You know that.

15:25.611 --> 15:28.686
M-mm. It's a lot of work
and stress, I know.

15:28.687 --> 15:30.834
I feel it, too.

15:30.835 --> 15:33.332
But it's all very worthwhile.

15:33.333 --> 15:34.791
M-mm.

15:36.070 --> 15:39.105
The replacements can be
an irritant. That's all.

15:39.106 --> 15:42.234
And they are.
Hopefully, we will not need another one.

15:42.235 --> 15:46.169
Well, if we do, we will
make do, as we always have.

15:46.170 --> 15:48.377
- Indeed.
- M-mm.

15:51.624 --> 15:53.571
M-mm.

15:53.572 --> 15:55.630
My love.

16:40.625 --> 16:42.873
I can't!

16:49.137 --> 16:51.084
Hello, my friends!

16:51.085 --> 16:56.069
Well, another seven
fights have crescendoed.

16:56.070 --> 16:58.546
Ha ha! Ahh.

16:58.547 --> 17:02.833
Well, congratulations to those down
below who have survived this day.

17:02.834 --> 17:08.695
You may rest easy knowing that your
loved ones will also survive this day.

17:08.696 --> 17:11.383
Let's meet Patricia Johnson.

17:11.384 --> 17:14.901
She is survived by several others,
most notably her parents,

17:14.902 --> 17:17.528
whom you see here.

17:17.917 --> 17:22.103
But because today you
fought and won, Cody,

17:22.104 --> 17:26.429
Your mother will live
to see another day.

17:27.417 --> 17:31.842
Ah, the pretty and independent Jamie
Williams grew up in foster homes,

17:31.843 --> 17:35.520
Then worked in a supermarket
while earning a business degree.

17:35.521 --> 17:40.125
Jamie was gathered to fight as a
replacement for Jennifer brown,

17:40.126 --> 17:46.499
who, you see here, tried to chew
her way through her obligations.

17:50.415 --> 17:53.811
She was survived by
her aunt and Uncle.

17:53.812 --> 17:56.298
May they rest in peace.

17:56.299 --> 18:02.732
But you, Sabrina, because
today you fought and won,

18:02.733 --> 18:05.559
your daughter will
live one more day.

18:05.560 --> 18:09.606
All right. Let the games continue!

18:34.551 --> 18:36.629
You "D"?

18:39.756 --> 18:41.464
Phoebe.

18:43.962 --> 18:47.008
Guess we both know
what's expected, huh?

18:47.009 --> 18:49.636
You haven't fought yet?

18:50.215 --> 18:54.111
They said they'll kill my baby
sister if I didn't fight.

18:54.112 --> 18:58.127
Her name is Antina.
She just got her degree.

18:58.128 --> 19:01.184
I put her through school.

19:06.239 --> 19:09.426
They said they'd kill my mother.

19:18.737 --> 19:21.044
It's not your fault.

19:21.045 --> 19:23.033
I know.

19:33.003 --> 19:36.709
Rah! Rah!

19:49.116 --> 19:52.084
Get the fuck off me!

20:13.142 --> 20:16.499
I fucking hate my mother.

20:24.461 --> 20:26.209
Sabrina?

20:32.503 --> 20:37.557
I knew no one could hurt you.
I-I saw you.

20:37.558 --> 20:40.245
You look strong.

20:41.664 --> 20:42.752
Did you see me?

20:42.753 --> 20:46.729
You're the one who broke that woman's
neck against the wall, right?

20:47.798 --> 20:49.666
No.

20:51.114 --> 20:54.051
How come you can fight like that?

20:59.206 --> 21:03.332
I watched him beat up
my mom so many times.

21:06.349 --> 21:10.225
And I just...
I couldn't watch it anymore.

21:18.697 --> 21:21.653
Facing the corner,
hands on your head.

21:21.654 --> 21:26.529
Let me tell you something right now...
I'm making it out of here.

21:28.687 --> 21:31.624
I don't give two shits
what you have to say.

21:31.625 --> 21:35.189
Just shut your mouth and
fucking stand back.

21:35.190 --> 21:38.357
The only question you have to ask is
what your neighbor over here asked...

21:38.358 --> 21:41.743
"How many more do I have to kill?"

21:41.744 --> 21:45.420
Facing the corner,
hands on your head.

21:50.465 --> 21:54.001
Don't you fucking eyeball me.

21:56.519 --> 21:58.935
It was a good first kill.
You should be proud.

21:58.936 --> 22:00.433
Fuck you. You made me kill her.

22:00.434 --> 22:03.370
No, you had a choice. You chose
to let your kid live another day.

22:03.371 --> 22:06.701
- I'd say, "good choice."
- That's not my kid.

22:06.639 --> 22:07.797
Oh, no?

22:07.798 --> 22:10.535
I don't have a daughter.

22:10.815 --> 22:15.390
So, you won't mind if I put
the kill order in, then...

22:17.658 --> 22:19.475
Since she's not your kid.

22:19.476 --> 22:24.611
If you think I give a fuck what you do
with that kid, you are gravely mistaken.

22:26.669 --> 22:30.624
If you want to kill
her be my guest.

22:30.625 --> 22:33.541
Don't you fuckin' eyeball me.

22:33.542 --> 22:38.326
You think just because you were
a P.O.W., you can take me on?!

22:38.327 --> 22:41.393
Let me tell you something about me!

22:41.394 --> 22:44.171
I didn't crack.

22:48.297 --> 22:51.384
You must be hungry.

22:57.888 --> 23:00.135
Let's go!

23:14.701 --> 23:17.608
Single file! Let's go!

23:32.143 --> 23:35.560
No. No. No. No!

23:35.929 --> 23:38.346
Aaah! Aaah! No!

23:38.347 --> 23:40.785
- Move!
- Aah!

23:45.550 --> 23:47.498
Let's go.

24:14.651 --> 24:17.128
Where are we going?

24:58.767 --> 25:01.634
Initiates, let's go.

25:04.291 --> 25:07.328
Get your ass up!

25:14.920 --> 25:16.868
Listen up.

25:17.768 --> 25:21.704
Your questions will be answered,
your concerns addressed,

25:21.705 --> 25:25.319
so just sit tight and
behave yourselves.

25:25.320 --> 25:27.398
His honor will speak beautifully,

25:27.399 --> 25:31.204
and you'll feel as if you
can say anything you want.

25:35.999 --> 25:40.254
Don't. Just keep those
pretty little mouths shut,

25:40.255 --> 25:43.401
and I do mean all of you,

25:43.402 --> 25:47.418
and before long, this
whole thing will be over.

25:49.286 --> 25:50.654
Understand that?

25:50.655 --> 25:52.452
Yes, sir!

25:52.453 --> 25:55.100
- Understand that?!
- Yes, sir!

26:27.048 --> 26:29.824
I wonder how many of
you I get to kill.

26:29.825 --> 26:33.701
- Here we go.
- Yeah, here we go.

26:33.701 --> 26:36.778
Just like the rest of
you, I can kill a bitch.

26:36.779 --> 26:40.903
Unlike the rest of you
I fucking love it.

26:40.904 --> 26:44.221
None of this makes any sense...
none of it.

26:45.100 --> 26:48.116
Cry. Cry. Cry.

26:48.117 --> 26:50.173
We have to figure out what
the reasoning is for this.

26:50.174 --> 26:52.591
If we can figure out the reasoning,
then we could talk to them.

26:52.592 --> 26:55.650
- Listen, we're all in the same...
- I'm not in the same anything...

26:55.651 --> 26:56.937
not with you.

26:56.938 --> 26:58.924
I shouldn't have listened
to those people.

26:58.925 --> 27:00.463
I should have kept talking to him.

27:00.464 --> 27:03.592
If I had kept talking to him, he
wouldn't have gone down in the box.

27:03.593 --> 27:05.659
Why did he go down in the box?

27:05.660 --> 27:08.915
- Ooh-whee!
- Looks like someone's off her meds.

27:08.916 --> 27:10.374
Stop it!

27:10.375 --> 27:14.430
- We need to find a way out!
- You know what? Good idea.

27:14.431 --> 27:18.526
You grab the keys, rain man
over here can grab a gun, and

27:18.527 --> 27:21.793
"we're all in the same
whatever" can call the cops.

27:21.794 --> 27:23.790
Sound good?

27:23.791 --> 27:25.948
She's trying to intimidate you.

27:25.949 --> 27:29.305
Damn. You're both
gonna be fun to wax.

27:29.306 --> 27:33.392
- If you lost them all.
- Are you saying you're gonna kill me?

27:33.393 --> 27:36.408
I'm saying you sound scared.

27:36.409 --> 27:39.405
- I sound scared?
- Yeah. Really?

27:39.406 --> 27:42.032
"How many more do I have to kill?"

27:42.033 --> 27:44.839
Ah, boo-fucking-hoo.

27:44.840 --> 27:46.138
Fuck you.

27:46.139 --> 27:49.116
We all heard you screaming
like a little girl.

27:49.117 --> 27:52.343
I'm scared? Really?

27:53.542 --> 27:55.390
I'm scared?

27:55.560 --> 27:57.735
Cody's right. We have
to find a way out.

27:57.736 --> 28:00.285
It's not that simple. We're probably
being monitored right now...

28:00.286 --> 28:02.642
every word, every move.

28:04.161 --> 28:06.559
Greetings, Victors.

28:08.227 --> 28:12.821
We have goaded the initiates
from their homes in frenzy.

28:12.822 --> 28:16.418
We lead our maenads into
battle with one another,

28:16.419 --> 28:22.002
beast within every maenad
made wild by the frenzy.

28:22.003 --> 28:27.737
Make the whole earth...
Thunder with your rhythm,

28:28.167 --> 28:31.992
with thundering shouts and screams,

28:31.993 --> 28:37.147
tearing creatures limb from
limb with their bare hands.

28:37.148 --> 28:40.614
Initiates... Fighters.

28:41.454 --> 28:43.629
Ladies, please forgive
the semantics.

28:43.630 --> 28:46.668
We tend to get a bit excited
during these times.

28:46.669 --> 28:49.426
M-mm. M-mm.

28:50.964 --> 28:55.698
Ff the 50 that we've gathered,
fewer than half of you remain,

28:55.699 --> 29:01.883
and we like to bring you here, six at
a time, intimately, to behold you.

29:04.171 --> 29:06.976
I know how it feels to
be where you are...

29:06.977 --> 29:09.176
the rush of fear, the helplessness.

29:09.177 --> 29:13.561
You don't have to be helpless.
That's all over now.

29:14.800 --> 29:16.478
Oh, look, sweetie.

29:16.479 --> 29:18.246
Wasn't she your pick?

29:18.247 --> 29:20.963
Indeed, she was... and is.

29:20.964 --> 29:23.810
And my favorite's here, too.

29:23.811 --> 29:30.105
And how you won... feigning
surrender only to betray her.

29:30.425 --> 29:34.251
I cherish the devious fighters.

29:34.700 --> 29:39.366
To be a woman, you have to
be devious in this world.

29:40.225 --> 29:45.568
I agree. I still prefer
Phoebe, however,

29:45.569 --> 29:49.465
for all of her bar
fights and jail time,

29:49.466 --> 29:53.041
setting fire to the tails of dogs.

29:53.042 --> 29:54.510
M-mm.

29:57.997 --> 30:00.912
And, of course, I can
understand wanting to try,

30:00.913 --> 30:03.160
but no one's ever
escaped, I'm afraid.

30:03.161 --> 30:05.659
My husband has run this
organization for a long time.

30:05.660 --> 30:08.297
For thousands of years.

30:08.486 --> 30:12.780
And his father ran the organization
before him and his father before him,

30:12.781 --> 30:14.111
et cetera, et cetera.

30:14.112 --> 30:16.528
But make no mistake.

30:17.348 --> 30:21.323
This is not about
me or my bloodline.

30:21.324 --> 30:24.699
This is about you...

30:24.700 --> 30:26.987
each of you.

30:26.988 --> 30:29.985
Remember the first time he
talked about the maenads.

30:29.986 --> 30:33.001
Between us, I thought he was crazy.

30:33.002 --> 30:34.889
But he wasn't crazy.

30:34.890 --> 30:37.886
He sees who we are...
all of us women.

30:37.887 --> 30:41.822
He sees the power we have inside.

30:41.823 --> 30:47.676
And the maenads... the maenads were
the first truly empowered women.

30:47.677 --> 30:50.673
They left the shackles
of polite society,

30:50.674 --> 30:54.549
freed themselves of all control...

30:54.550 --> 31:00.794
hunting down animals and
humans, reveling in the blood.

31:01.713 --> 31:04.750
They were so special.

31:05.350 --> 31:07.726
Is that what this is all about?

31:07.727 --> 31:11.473
If we win enough fights, we get
to join your organization?

31:11.474 --> 31:17.807
Join our organization?
Huh. That's food for thought.

31:18.656 --> 31:23.261
There are 22 of you left, and the
one that sees this room again

31:23.262 --> 31:27.088
will be the one that's brought to
us as champion in three days' time.

31:27.089 --> 31:30.254
And that champion will be released,

31:30.255 --> 31:35.010
reintegrated into
society, transformed.

31:35.689 --> 31:39.844
Search yourselves for the
strength you carry within you.

31:39.845 --> 31:44.980
Here is where you will
manifest all that you are.

31:46.199 --> 31:49.085
And that, ladies,
is why you're with us.

31:49.086 --> 31:52.531
And that is the secret
to your survival.

31:52.532 --> 31:55.609
Look deeply within.

31:56.199 --> 31:59.975
Find what's worth fighting for.

32:06.608 --> 32:10.483
Hey, sunshine. Listen...

32:10.484 --> 32:12.700
We got off on the wrong foot, huh?

32:12.701 --> 32:17.757
I was inspired by the way you killed that
bitch who didn't even know she had to fight.

32:17.758 --> 32:22.702
Let's see how well you do with
someone who's expecting it, huh?

32:36.818 --> 32:40.194
I like your story.

32:40.195 --> 32:43.042
I got a story, too.

32:43.961 --> 32:46.169
No shit.

32:47.128 --> 32:52.112
I was raised in foster homes
by sick motherfuckin' rapists

32:52.113 --> 32:57.487
who'd rather stick their cocks
in girls than give us dinner.

32:58.466 --> 33:01.463
Girls like that whore kid you got.

33:02.163 --> 33:03.391
Hey!

33:03.601 --> 33:07.267
- I'll fucking kill you!
- Hey! Hey!

33:07.268 --> 33:10.085
I want your fucking kid dead!

33:10.285 --> 33:13.401
Move! Move! Move!

33:37.557 --> 33:40.473
- Please let me get...
- Jesus.

33:40.474 --> 33:44.580
Baby. Baby. Let me
help you, please.

33:47.917 --> 33:50.504
Hey, Sabrina.

33:52.322 --> 33:54.400
You military?

33:56.628 --> 33:58.996
Yeah. I was.

33:59.935 --> 34:03.172
You were a prisoner of war?

34:03.901 --> 34:06.358
You escaped?

34:06.978 --> 34:10.464
What good does that do us?

34:21.014 --> 34:22.641
Why?

34:24.460 --> 34:25.759
Hey.

34:28.246 --> 34:29.405
Hey.

34:30.444 --> 34:32.391
Are you okay?

34:38.835 --> 34:40.614
I have to get out.

34:43.781 --> 34:46.388
I know we can do this.

34:47.098 --> 34:50.114
- All we'd have to do is...
- Is what?

34:51.783 --> 34:54.560
Kill those motherfuckers.

35:06.069 --> 35:10.673
Plus those other two guys and...
and that other guard.

35:10.674 --> 35:12.680
That's eight, plus the
man and the woman...

35:12.681 --> 35:15.657
and then the guys who
brought them food, so 12?

35:15.658 --> 35:18.486
I mean, she's right.
We can... we can do this.

35:18.487 --> 35:21.202
Don't you see what
they're capable of?

35:21.203 --> 35:23.061
Who's recording Megan?

35:23.062 --> 35:25.177
I gave her up for
adoption 13 years ago.

35:25.178 --> 35:28.686
I haven't the slightest idea where she is.
I didn't even know her name.

35:28.687 --> 35:32.811
And these people have a camera
in her fucking bedroom.

35:32.812 --> 35:36.987
So... so, what, then? We just...

35:36.988 --> 35:41.463
we keep killing until we die
and then my mom dies anyways?

35:42.572 --> 35:44.480
Sabrina?

35:48.176 --> 35:51.261
Look, if we could all just
get together and get guns...

35:51.262 --> 35:54.248
All six of us were together,
and none of us got guns.

35:54.249 --> 35:58.446
- We need a plan!
- We need a better plan than the impossible!

36:00.934 --> 36:04.051
Baby, I'm coming.

36:08.306 --> 36:09.745
Aaah!

36:53.971 --> 36:55.419
Sabrina...

36:57.607 --> 36:59.125
What?

37:01.803 --> 37:05.010
I'm sorry for yelling at you.

37:14.720 --> 37:18.226
What if we have to
fight each other?

37:26.658 --> 37:28.306
Sabrina!

37:29.485 --> 37:31.263
Cody.

37:33.141 --> 37:35.799
Come on, Cody.

37:36.228 --> 37:38.516
Stop!

37:40.614 --> 37:44.160
Hit her, Cody. Come on!

37:48.806 --> 37:52.401
- Get away. Get off.
- No!

37:52.402 --> 37:54.900
Go, Cody. Fight back.

37:56.938 --> 37:58.685
Get her off you!

37:58.686 --> 38:01.083
Good girl. Good girl.

38:02.412 --> 38:04.120
That's it.

38:11.483 --> 38:13.470
Yes. Yes.

38:13.471 --> 38:15.268
Fight it.

38:15.269 --> 38:18.266
Push your hips out.
Cody, push your hips out.

38:22.032 --> 38:23.230
Squeeze. Squeeze.

38:23.231 --> 38:27.037
Squeeze, baby, squeeze.
Come on. Come on.

38:33.801 --> 38:36.028
Hold it, Cody. Hold it.

38:44.800 --> 38:46.568
That's it.

38:51.343 --> 38:52.802
Okay.

39:39.375 --> 39:42.631
- Sabrina, no!
- Cody, let her go.

39:42.632 --> 39:45.299
- No!
- She'll be back.

39:47.697 --> 39:49.755
Don't worry.

40:05.589 --> 40:07.297
Hi.

41:06.927 --> 41:11.033
Ugh! I heard about your daughter...
your daughter

41:15.419 --> 41:19.635
I have a fiancé. We're
getting married in a month

41:49.924 --> 41:51.572
She just fought!

41:51.573 --> 41:55.988
- We need more time!
- She's not ready to fight again!

41:56.438 --> 41:58.676
I can't fight.

41:59.814 --> 42:01.912
Let's go, Sabrina.

42:03.041 --> 42:05.827
Think about your baby girl.

42:33.531 --> 42:35.798
Good girl.

44:12.032 --> 44:13.880
Sabrina.

44:15.998 --> 44:17.966
Sabrina.

44:21.962 --> 44:22.900
Megan?

44:22.901 --> 44:25.857
I was gonna call you "Samantha."

44:25.858 --> 44:28.616
I liked the name "Sam."

44:33.471 --> 44:35.418
I never knew my father.

44:35.419 --> 44:37.686
Mom always said I was
better off, but...

44:37.687 --> 44:41.692
I just always wanted to ask him...

44:47.457 --> 44:49.904
"Why, daddy?"

44:55.618 --> 44:58.206
If you could hear me.

44:59.065 --> 45:02.212
There's nothing about me that
would make a good mother.

45:02.213 --> 45:05.718
I'm flawed. I'm very flawed.

45:07.626 --> 45:10.913
I was broken, you know?

45:11.692 --> 45:14.749
Oh, you were perfect.

45:17.527 --> 45:20.054
I carried you.

45:20.693 --> 45:23.990
I carried you every day, Samantha.

45:24.819 --> 45:27.986
And now you may never know.

45:53.191 --> 45:55.379
Teresa!

45:57.536 --> 45:59.075
Yes?

45:59.614 --> 46:01.982
Is she dead?

46:06.178 --> 46:08.405
I can't believe this!

46:08.406 --> 46:12.041
Let my mother go! Let my mother go!

46:12.042 --> 46:18.036
I don't care if I live anymore!
I want to go home.

46:19.485 --> 46:22.292
Cody, listen to me.

46:23.131 --> 46:27.806
The people you love could be
taken away from you like that.

46:29.475 --> 46:35.019
Don't fight for your mother.
Fight for yourself.

48:13.101 --> 48:17.936
Tell Matty that I
love him very much...

48:18.485 --> 48:21.273
And I'm so sorry.

49:54.020 --> 49:56.927
Come on, Brenda.

49:58.146 --> 50:00.933
The sign said, "no spitting."

50:01.273 --> 50:03.369
- Excuse me, ma'am.
- Yeah?

50:03.370 --> 50:05.208
It's Kurtz.

50:05.209 --> 50:06.665
- Excuse me.
- Oh, no, Joseph.

50:06.666 --> 50:09.294
Let me handle it.
Can you excuse me a minute?

50:09.295 --> 50:10.602
- Sure.
- Thanks.

50:10.603 --> 50:12.331
No! No!

50:13.590 --> 50:16.437
No! Oh, no! No!

50:17.656 --> 50:18.854
Yes, ma'am.

50:18.855 --> 50:21.252
- Stay down.
- Yes, ma'am.

50:21.253 --> 50:24.100
All right. She's coming down.

50:26.048 --> 50:27.505
- Hey.
- Stay down.

50:27.506 --> 50:30.323
Back to your cell.

50:31.412 --> 50:33.001
Stay down.

50:34.479 --> 50:36.148
Move it!

50:56.168 --> 50:57.626
Ahh!

50:58.355 --> 50:59.804
Ohh!

51:01.472 --> 51:03.040
Ahh!

51:03.041 --> 51:04.669
Ahh!

51:09.304 --> 51:11.810
- Sorry to disturb you.
- No, no, please.

51:11.811 --> 51:15.059
That's what I'm here for,
William... here to help.

51:15.060 --> 51:17.265
Oh, poor Brenda.

51:17.266 --> 51:19.834
Can we let her up?

51:20.433 --> 51:24.648
Brenda, dear, can we discuss this?

51:24.649 --> 51:28.494
Listen to me.
This is very important, okay?

51:28.495 --> 51:31.881
I want you to look at your
mother on the screen.

51:31.882 --> 51:35.258
Go on. Look at your mama. Go ahead.

51:37.167 --> 51:41.083
Can we get some water or a cold
compress or something, please?

52:00.913 --> 52:03.010
I'm here to help you.

52:03.011 --> 52:06.236
I'm gonna help you, okay?

52:06.237 --> 52:08.485
Breathe.

52:11.912 --> 52:13.710
Good.

52:14.409 --> 52:15.777
Okay?

52:15.778 --> 52:17.985
Back with us now?

52:17.986 --> 52:19.373
Okay.

52:19.374 --> 52:23.909
Okay, listen... Brenda, we're
gonna try this one more time.

52:23.910 --> 52:27.675
I want you to look at the
screen with your mother.

52:27.676 --> 52:30.843
Look at your mama.

52:43.850 --> 52:47.856
Brenda, the only way you're gonna
be able to save your loved ones...

52:47.857 --> 52:50.762
is for you to go down
there and fight.

52:50.763 --> 52:54.269
It's just the way it has to be.

52:55.528 --> 52:59.383
- Are you okay?
- Ohh. Yeah, I'm fine.

52:59.384 --> 53:02.291
I'm fine. I...

53:04.179 --> 53:06.727
She's not salvageable.

53:07.796 --> 53:09.844
Poor thing.

53:25.598 --> 53:27.416
Brenda!

53:29.144 --> 53:30.623
Ugh!

53:33.620 --> 53:35.368
No, no, no.

53:37.316 --> 53:40.703
Now we have to find
a new replacement.

53:41.702 --> 53:43.480
Poor Joseph.

53:44.229 --> 53:46.866
Please. Please.

53:46.867 --> 53:49.534
- It's okay.
- My daughter.

54:02.141 --> 54:03.890
Cody?

54:13.610 --> 54:15.578
Teresa?

54:45.188 --> 54:50.603
What do you think they'd do if we just..
Refused to fight?

54:54.129 --> 54:57.675
Come down and kill us both.

54:57.676 --> 55:00.843
Kill our families.

55:16.057 --> 55:19.204
How's your mother?

55:20.363 --> 55:21.882
What?

55:22.651 --> 55:24.809
Your mother.

55:25.558 --> 55:28.484
Don't talk about my mother.

55:28.485 --> 55:31.781
I saw what you did to that woman.

55:31.782 --> 55:35.078
Fight for yourself, right?

55:35.448 --> 55:37.006
Right?

56:04.948 --> 56:07.146
You know...

56:08.045 --> 56:12.611
when I first met my
husband, Jason...

56:15.108 --> 56:18.314
we were at this
party, and he, um...

56:18.315 --> 56:26.067
and he said he wanted to dance with
a girl who had twizzlers for hair.

56:27.126 --> 56:30.902
He's been on ventilation
in I.C.U. For months.

56:30.902 --> 56:35.628
If he dies now, it would
probably be a blessing for him.

56:43.310 --> 56:45.937
How's your mother?

56:48.745 --> 56:51.611
Her health is good?

56:51.612 --> 56:53.300
Yeah.

56:53.989 --> 56:56.446
She loves you?

56:56.447 --> 56:59.184
She needs you?

56:59.844 --> 57:01.602
Yeah.

57:02.161 --> 57:03.999
And you need her.

57:49.804 --> 57:52.291
- You're...
- Shut up!

58:08.804 --> 58:10.303
Squeeze.

58:11.282 --> 58:12.870
Squeeze.

58:13.190 --> 58:14.749
Go on. Squeeze.

58:15.628 --> 58:17.726
Squeeze. Go on.

59:45.488 --> 59:47.116
Why?

59:58.495 --> 01:00:02.261
Sabrina!

01:00:05.598 --> 01:00:07.396
Atten-hut!

01:00:12.291 --> 01:00:14.329
You're dead.

01:00:15.957 --> 01:00:18.285
You're dead.

01:00:19.334 --> 01:00:21.412
You...

01:00:22.611 --> 01:00:24.707
you're definitely dead.

01:00:24.708 --> 01:00:26.865
Just come a little closer.

01:00:26.866 --> 01:00:30.573
Please, just come a little closer.

01:00:31.721 --> 01:00:33.050
Fuck.

01:00:33.120 --> 01:00:34.677
I'll fuck you up!

01:00:34.678 --> 01:00:37.885
You're not gonna even
get to say goodbye.

01:00:38.505 --> 01:00:41.411
Just come a little bit closer,

01:00:41.412 --> 01:00:43.489
Please. Just come a little...

01:00:43.490 --> 01:00:48.135
- Fight or die, right?
- Don't you fucking touch her!

01:00:58.345 --> 01:00:59.943
Okay.

01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:24.787
Hey, there.

01:01:24.788 --> 01:01:26.965
Just wanted to talk.

01:01:26.966 --> 01:01:29.622
Thought you made it down here.

01:01:29.623 --> 01:01:32.061
All right. You can
do this, Cody, okay?

01:01:32.062 --> 01:01:37.854
I just came down here to tell you how...
Impressed I've been,

01:01:37.855 --> 01:01:43.608
seeing you kill all these girls,
even your black friend.

01:01:43.609 --> 01:01:45.966
Saw her on the way in.

01:01:45.967 --> 01:01:49.393
Parents would be proud...

01:01:49.394 --> 01:01:52.809
Except maybe your father.

01:01:52.810 --> 01:02:00.302
Heard your story through the walls... his
big, greasy hands all over your mother.

01:02:00.303 --> 01:02:03.079
I would have done the same thing.

01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:06.466
Did he, uh, touch, you, too?

01:02:06.467 --> 01:02:07.425
Stop!

01:02:07.426 --> 01:02:09.483
He did, didn't he?

01:02:09.484 --> 01:02:12.729
Tell me, how'd you do it, huh?

01:02:12.730 --> 01:02:15.088
You stab him, push
him down the stairs?

01:02:15.089 --> 01:02:16.456
Don't!

01:02:16.457 --> 01:02:20.452
Gun? No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:02:20.453 --> 01:02:22.569
You poisoned him, didn't you?

01:02:22.570 --> 01:02:24.368
Yeah.

01:02:24.369 --> 01:02:26.935
That's what I would have done.

01:02:26.936 --> 01:02:29.273
Your story's the same.

01:02:29.274 --> 01:02:32.241
You're just like me now.

01:02:48.614 --> 01:02:51.581
This one's for you, Sabrina!

01:02:56.826 --> 01:03:00.852
Where you going, sweetheart? Huh?
I'm not done with you yet.

01:03:05.597 --> 01:03:08.014
I knew you'd be easy.

01:03:08.015 --> 01:03:12.381
But, fuck, I didn't
know it'd be this easy.

01:03:19.723 --> 01:03:23.119
Kind of sad your friend
gave her life... huh?

01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:26.716
Just so you could
die seconds later.

01:03:27.296 --> 01:03:29.623
What a waste.

01:03:39.703 --> 01:03:41.182
Aah!

01:03:44.389 --> 01:03:47.316
Let's try that again.

01:03:48.175 --> 01:03:50.812
Get up, Cody.

01:03:53.999 --> 01:03:56.835
I know you can't hear me, Sabrina,

01:03:56.836 --> 01:04:01.441
but you've got to understand,
I do it all out of respect.

01:04:01.442 --> 01:04:03.260
Fuck it.

01:04:05.587 --> 01:04:08.225
I want to fight.

01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:14.707
I want to fight.

01:04:14.708 --> 01:04:17.615
I want to fight! You hear me?!

01:04:23.669 --> 01:04:26.876
I hate to end the
party, sweetheart...

01:04:28.614 --> 01:04:31.761
but I'm ready for the main event.

01:05:02.870 --> 01:05:05.947
I want Sabrina!

01:05:08.794 --> 01:05:11.082
Stay there.

01:05:12.790 --> 01:05:16.046
I'll be right with you.

01:05:16.047 --> 01:05:18.484
Do you hear me,
you fucking assholes?!

01:05:18.485 --> 01:05:22.550
I really want to fight!
Are you gonna let me fight?!

01:05:33.589 --> 01:05:36.306
- I want to fight.
- Yeah, I heard.

01:05:36.307 --> 01:05:40.222
Listen, no one here wants you
to fight more than I do.

01:05:40.223 --> 01:05:43.648
All right, I guess
you've earned it.

01:05:43.649 --> 01:05:47.306
But first you have
to give up the pen.

01:05:51.262 --> 01:05:56.356
You really think you're the first
person that would try the pen trick?

01:06:04.418 --> 01:06:07.395
All right. Good girl.

01:06:17.575 --> 01:06:20.682
I want to fight.

01:06:22.670 --> 01:06:28.125
You can fight all you want.
We're gonna kill your kid anyway.

01:06:50.572 --> 01:06:53.199
You want her?

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:55.707
You got her.

01:06:55.787 --> 01:06:57.036
Aah!

01:07:08.354 --> 01:07:09.912
Come on.

01:07:09.913 --> 01:07:11.641
Come on!

01:07:28.674 --> 01:07:31.072
- Come on, bitch.

01:09:20.702 --> 01:09:24.466
Aww. You think you're done?

01:09:24.468 --> 01:09:26.904
The replacement.

01:09:26.906 --> 01:09:31.651
Well, lucky you. You
get to kill them both.

01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:35.078
Over to the far wall.

01:09:56.067 --> 01:09:58.973
Well, hello, friends.

01:09:58.974 --> 01:10:04.458
Yes, the time has finally come.
We approach culmination.

01:10:09.263 --> 01:10:13.478
And what a week it has been.
But before we begin,

01:10:13.479 --> 01:10:19.063
Let us look at an initiate who could
be the daughter of sacmus herself.

01:10:19.064 --> 01:10:22.660
The violence that she has endured,
the violence that she has suffered...

01:10:22.661 --> 01:10:24.077
Come on.

01:10:24.078 --> 01:10:27.535
Sabrina, the one to watch.

01:10:27.965 --> 01:10:29.763
Come on in.

01:10:29.803 --> 01:10:34.687
Who could have expected the sheer
efficiency of her most recent kill?

01:10:34.688 --> 01:10:37.424
It is to be respected,
to be honored.

01:10:37.425 --> 01:10:43.868
Let us guide Sabrina into her final battle,
facing one whom we have freshly reaped.

01:10:43.869 --> 01:10:46.985
Yes, a replacement.

01:10:46.986 --> 01:10:52.660
Now, it's true a final fight against a newly
plucked initiative is unprecedented, but...

01:10:52.661 --> 01:10:58.973
no more unprecedented than the
worthiness of this new adversary...

01:10:58.974 --> 01:11:01.040
Isabelle Thomas,

01:11:01.041 --> 01:11:06.027
a former collegiate athlete who earned a
full athletic scholarship to Northwestern.

01:11:06.027 --> 01:11:10.931
Now she spends her time operating a
gym that she owns with her husband

01:11:10.932 --> 01:11:14.248
and trains in with her husband
and trains in Brazilian jiujitsu.

01:11:14.249 --> 01:11:19.062
Exciting. The Victor of
this singular contest...

01:11:19.063 --> 01:11:22.800
will be our champion!

01:11:29.333 --> 01:11:31.551
I'm Sabrina.

01:11:33.309 --> 01:11:35.367
I figured.

01:11:38.424 --> 01:11:40.602
Where are we?

01:11:40.862 --> 01:11:43.169
It doesn't matter.

01:11:48.694 --> 01:11:53.039
Do you understand why
they have us here?

01:11:54.658 --> 01:11:58.253
Do you have any children?

01:11:58.254 --> 01:11:59.883
No.

01:12:02.090 --> 01:12:06.125
Then I'm really sorry
they have your husband.

01:12:06.126 --> 01:12:09.892
That's how they make us fight.

01:12:09.893 --> 01:12:13.579
If you don't fight,
they'll kill him.

01:12:14.408 --> 01:12:17.855
If you lose, they'll kill him.

01:12:19.373 --> 01:12:22.800
Who are you fighting for?

01:12:27.165 --> 01:12:29.343
My daughter.

01:12:34.928 --> 01:12:39.103
I'm fighting for my daughter!

01:12:43.229 --> 01:12:46.436
So, we have to fight.

01:12:48.664 --> 01:12:50.591
We have to fight.

01:12:50.592 --> 01:12:53.049
How do I know you're
not lying to me?

01:12:53.050 --> 01:12:55.577
Look around you.

01:12:58.554 --> 01:13:02.530
What other choice do you have?

01:13:07.105 --> 01:13:09.113
Come on.

01:13:11.551 --> 01:13:13.289
Fight!

01:13:13.479 --> 01:13:15.407
Come on.

01:13:28.244 --> 01:13:32.310
Ooh. Huh.

01:13:35.057 --> 01:13:37.594
That was a good one. That was good.

01:13:37.595 --> 01:13:40.391
You can do this. Come on.

01:13:40.392 --> 01:13:42.320
- You got to do it.
- Fuck you.

01:13:42.321 --> 01:13:44.957
- Yeah, that's good.
- Fuck you.

01:13:48.993 --> 01:13:51.241
Listen. Listen.

01:13:52.780 --> 01:13:55.946
Ladies and gentlemen, behold!

01:14:00.222 --> 01:14:02.370
All right. Okay.

01:14:04.058 --> 01:14:06.116
Listen to me.

01:14:07.195 --> 01:14:09.302
You don't have to do this.

01:14:09.303 --> 01:14:12.430
- It's crazy.
- Yeah, it's crazy.

01:14:14.328 --> 01:14:17.174
But we don't have a
choice, all right?

01:14:17.175 --> 01:14:19.702
You have to fight.

01:14:19.703 --> 01:14:22.670
You have to fight!

01:14:30.142 --> 01:14:33.289
That's it. Do it. Do it!

01:14:33.779 --> 01:14:35.337
Do it!

01:15:13.958 --> 01:15:16.135
Astonishing!

01:15:16.136 --> 01:15:21.080
Now, in all our years, the most
unexpected culmination so far.

01:15:21.081 --> 01:15:24.168
To watch her, I could have sworn
Sabrina would be our champion,

01:15:24.169 --> 01:15:29.402
but her exceptional violence was
defeated by an ever greater violence.

01:15:29.403 --> 01:15:34.587
I-I'm sorry, my dear, but it appears
that both of our favorites have lost.

01:15:34.588 --> 01:15:37.125
What a year. Congratulations
to the champion.

01:15:37.126 --> 01:15:42.779
And now my beautiful wife and I are going
to go meet and greet our champion.

01:16:20.092 --> 01:16:23.918
Oh, uh, I think you
owe me something.

01:16:25.117 --> 01:16:26.854
That girl's dead.

01:16:26.855 --> 01:16:28.792
- You got lucky.
- Yeah.

01:16:28.793 --> 01:16:30.361
Son of a bitch.

01:16:30.362 --> 01:16:33.718
- What was that?
- I said, "go fuck yourself."

01:16:38.424 --> 01:16:40.671
William...

01:16:40.672 --> 01:16:44.496
We want to thank you for the
enthusiasm you add to our efforts.

01:16:44.497 --> 01:16:48.354
- You have well earned your time to relax.
- And you're like family to us.

01:16:48.355 --> 01:16:50.231
Sir. Ma'am.

01:16:50.232 --> 01:16:52.439
Oh, enough with the formalities.

01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:56.146
Go join the fun. I'm sure some of our
guests would love to hear your stories.

01:16:56.147 --> 01:16:58.603
Need to count this?

01:16:58.604 --> 01:17:00.632
I trust you.

01:17:01.770 --> 01:17:03.818
What a douche.

01:17:04.737 --> 01:17:06.565
700 bucks.

01:17:06.566 --> 01:17:08.912
Fucking losing it to that twit.

01:17:08.913 --> 01:17:10.321
Fucking shrimp.

01:17:10.322 --> 01:17:15.657
Clean you up. Yeah, I'll fucking take
good care of you... clean you real good.

01:17:17.365 --> 01:17:19.372
Nice little band-aid.

01:17:19.373 --> 01:17:21.709
Thanks for nothing.

01:17:21.710 --> 01:17:24.318
- You're welcome.
- Aah!

01:17:27.954 --> 01:17:29.413
Ohh!

01:17:30.502 --> 01:17:31.830
Aah!

01:17:32.450 --> 01:17:33.968
Hey.

01:17:35.337 --> 01:17:37.025
Fat fuck.

01:17:41.351 --> 01:17:44.407
You got me again.
That was a good one.

01:17:44.408 --> 01:17:47.315
You owe me 5 bucks.

01:18:44.767 --> 01:18:48.422
As an aussie, I'm just glad
that fucking kiwi's dead. She's...

01:18:55.357 --> 01:18:59.891
Deathless by nature, destroyed,
demolished, razed to the ground

01:18:59.892 --> 01:19:05.477
buried by woman to the flesh
of woman's sacrifice.

01:19:05.517 --> 01:19:08.662
But I-I hope you don't
mind my saying...

01:19:08.663 --> 01:19:12.040
It was a great surprise.

01:19:12.859 --> 01:19:15.956
I'm glad you like surprises.

01:19:22.719 --> 01:19:26.166
We have waited the seven days
for the one who would most

01:19:26.167 --> 01:19:31.979
successfully epitomize the
purest image of female prowess.

01:19:31.980 --> 01:19:35.216
What we are capable
of as a species.

01:19:35.217 --> 01:19:39.061
We will clean you, dress you,
introduce you to our society, no

01:19:39.062 --> 01:19:42.999
no longer an initiate but longer an
initiate but changed... dare I say it?...

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:44.566
Transformed.

01:19:44.567 --> 01:19:46.915
A true maenad.

01:20:00.182 --> 01:20:02.390
- I'm sorry I'm so late.
- I know. I'm just glad you're here.

01:20:02.391 --> 01:20:04.587
Look out!

01:20:13.279 --> 01:20:15.356
How are you? You all right?

01:20:15.357 --> 01:20:16.256
- You all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:20:16.257 --> 01:20:18.923
- Joseph.
- Darling.

01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:24.108
Oh, shit.

01:20:28.044 --> 01:20:30.541
How can you be a part of this?

01:20:35.596 --> 01:20:37.264
You're a woman!

01:20:37.265 --> 01:20:39.183
Exactly.

01:21:17.844 --> 01:21:21.340
My wife! My love!

01:21:21.341 --> 01:21:22.618
Elizabeth.

01:21:22.619 --> 01:21:26.514
It may please you to know...
That once you're dead,

01:21:26.515 --> 01:21:29.481
I will allow your daughter to live.

01:21:29.482 --> 01:21:31.201
Uh-huh.

01:21:33.029 --> 01:21:35.815
I hope you feel a
deep motherly pride,

01:21:35.816 --> 01:21:39.631
because you fought so well...

01:21:39.632 --> 01:21:44.187
We'll provide your daughter the
opportunity to fight, too, just

01:21:44.188 --> 01:21:47.433
just like you... just like you.

01:21:47.434 --> 01:21:51.780
Perhaps she can possess the
tenacity to become champion.

01:22:58.124 --> 01:22:59.772
What?!

01:23:00.162 --> 01:23:01.340
Aah!

01:23:34.068 --> 01:23:36.895
Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Ugh!

01:24:01.221 --> 01:24:03.558
You were wrong.

01:24:08.283 --> 01:24:10.871
You did crack.

01:26:39.252 --> 01:26:43.039
- You really do medical claims?
- Yeah.

01:26:52.209 --> 01:26:54.416
Stop! Stop!

01:26:54.417 --> 01:26:56.445
I'm sorry.

01:28:10.111 --> 01:28:14.247
I'm fighting for my daughter!
