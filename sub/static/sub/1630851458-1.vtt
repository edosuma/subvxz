00:07.920 --> 00:11.200
-What do we know about her?
-She's like a ghost, invisible.

00:11.280 --> 00:13.160
There's no such thing as ghosts, Marsé.

00:13.240 --> 00:15.280
She doesn't socialize
with anyone at the guesthouse.

00:15.360 --> 00:17.440
She sleeps by day
and only goes out at night to work.

00:17.520 --> 00:20.600
Never the same route twice.
Today, she got off at Antón Martín

00:20.680 --> 00:22.800
to transfer Bilbao,
and from there to Goya.

00:22.880 --> 00:24.640
I almost lost her in one of the cars.

00:24.720 --> 00:27.440
Yet she always arrives
at the restaurant at 6:20 p.m.

00:27.520 --> 00:29.200
She's as punctual as the clock.

00:29.800 --> 00:32.760
-At half past, she's waiting on tables.
-Did she see you?

00:32.840 --> 00:34.240
Of course she didn't.

00:34.320 --> 00:36.280
An hour and 15 minutes
to get to work.

00:36.360 --> 00:38.320
The restaurant's
less than 20 minutes from home.

00:38.400 --> 00:41.360
When she finishes her shift,
she does the same to return home.

00:41.880 --> 00:46.200
The question is, why go to all this
trouble if she has nothing to hide?

00:47.240 --> 00:50.160
Because she does have something to hide.

00:50.240 --> 00:51.680
Let's keep watching her.

00:53.480 --> 00:55.160
How long will we have
to keep following her?

00:55.240 --> 00:57.760
-For as long as it takes.
-We're shooting in the dark.

00:57.840 --> 01:00.520
Well, we'll have to keep at it
until we hit our target.

01:01.120 --> 01:04.920
If she tries anything, I don't need
to tell you what we have to do, right?

01:06.480 --> 01:09.480
I don't want any mistakes
now that we're so close. Understood?

01:12.160 --> 01:13.000
Understood.

01:31.440 --> 01:32.440
A NETFLIX SERIES

03:09.680 --> 03:13.520
EPISODE 1 - HAUS

04:32.080 --> 04:33.360
Your dishes.

04:34.080 --> 04:35.800
Rheinischer Sauerbraten.

04:36.760 --> 04:38.160
Mmm!

04:38.240 --> 04:40.080
My goodness, it smells divine.

04:40.160 --> 04:41.320
-And rabbit.
-Delicious.

04:42.320 --> 04:43.760
That's very kind of you.

04:43.840 --> 04:45.080
You're welcome.

04:46.520 --> 04:47.440
Miss?

04:47.880 --> 04:50.080
Is everything to your liking, sir?

04:50.160 --> 04:51.960
Everything is excellent.

04:52.040 --> 04:54.840
We wanted to ask you something.
Are you German?

04:55.720 --> 04:56.880
No, sir.

04:56.960 --> 05:01.960
If you aren't, going by your accent,
I'd say you lived in Germany a long time.

05:02.040 --> 05:03.920
That's very kind of you to say.

05:24.240 --> 05:26.280
Everyone away from the door!

05:26.360 --> 05:27.920
Come on, quickly.

05:29.160 --> 05:30.520
Just don't come in.

05:34.320 --> 05:36.920
All men and boys over 20,
you're going.

05:37.760 --> 05:39.040
-Javier!
-No!

05:39.120 --> 05:40.440
No!

05:40.520 --> 05:42.760
Isabel, listen to me. Stay here.

05:42.840 --> 05:44.760
Dad!

05:45.360 --> 05:46.880
Isabel, stay here!

05:47.600 --> 05:48.920
Dad!

05:51.440 --> 05:55.520
Men and boys only!
Women and girls, do not get off!

05:56.680 --> 05:59.240
Do not get off the train!

05:59.760 --> 06:01.760
Men and boys. Quickly.

06:12.720 --> 06:13.760
Get out!

06:14.360 --> 06:15.240
Come on!

06:15.320 --> 06:16.640
Get up!

06:16.720 --> 06:18.920
Move, everyone!

06:19.000 --> 06:20.760
Get up! That's an order!

06:21.920 --> 06:22.920
I said, get up!

06:29.720 --> 06:31.200
Captain Bachmann!

06:37.560 --> 06:38.920
Captain Bachmann.

06:48.160 --> 06:50.760
What the hell's the meaning of this?

06:53.360 --> 06:54.680
Why are you here?

06:54.760 --> 06:56.680
I don't understand.

07:05.760 --> 07:06.840
Isabel!

07:06.920 --> 07:08.880
Wait, no! Dad!

07:09.640 --> 07:10.520
No!

07:14.320 --> 07:15.640
No!

07:16.800 --> 07:19.600
No! No, no!

07:20.360 --> 07:21.640
No!

07:22.640 --> 07:24.680
No!

07:30.480 --> 07:32.880
No!

07:34.040 --> 07:36.920
No, Dad!

07:38.040 --> 07:40.840
No! No!

07:40.920 --> 07:42.920
Have you found anything interesting?

07:46.760 --> 07:49.240
I wanted to see
how many reservations we have tomorrow.

07:49.320 --> 07:53.200
Discretion is a virtue, without which
the other virtues aren't virtues at all.

07:53.280 --> 07:55.640
Isabel, tell me.
How long have you been with us?

07:57.560 --> 07:59.120
It's been almost a year now.

07:59.200 --> 08:00.880
Let's hope you make it one full year.

08:00.960 --> 08:02.960
Go get some rest.
Tomorrow will be a tough day.

08:03.040 --> 08:06.320
The restaurant's completely booked.

08:58.320 --> 09:00.680
There is so much sorrow
in that body.

09:05.520 --> 09:08.840
Antonio told me you were coming,
but I didn't expect you so early.

09:12.960 --> 09:14.960
Do you have what I wanted from him?

09:15.040 --> 09:16.200
Yes.

09:17.840 --> 09:20.600
Here you go. You's be able
to kill a lot of rats with this.

09:21.720 --> 09:22.560
But watch out.

09:23.360 --> 09:26.680
Don't let it touch your skin.
One minute and that'll be it.

09:26.760 --> 09:30.920
I wouldn't get too close if I were you,
because it won't be a very pretty sight.

09:36.760 --> 09:37.760
Oh.

09:37.840 --> 09:40.560
This is in case the rats are bigger.

09:40.640 --> 09:42.760
Antonio asked me to give this to you.

09:43.560 --> 09:44.600
No, thank you.

10:40.520 --> 10:42.280
What do you want?

10:46.360 --> 10:47.800
-Let me go!
-Who are you?

10:47.880 --> 10:49.120
Hey! What do you want?

10:49.200 --> 10:50.640
-How did you get in here?
-I'm sorry!

10:50.720 --> 10:51.560
Tell me!

10:51.640 --> 10:54.080
I thought you'd left.
My mother has the master key.

10:54.160 --> 10:57.120
I came to listen to music.
I do it when you leave for work.

10:57.760 --> 11:01.440
Sometimes I listen to it from the hallway.
I like the songs, I don't understand them.

11:01.520 --> 11:02.720
Please don't hurt me.

11:06.040 --> 11:08.320
It's eight o'clock.
You're never here this late.

11:14.320 --> 11:16.960
It's confirmed, she's doing it today.
We stop her, whatever it takes.

11:17.040 --> 11:18.080
Whatever it takes, Lucena?

11:18.160 --> 11:21.000
I want her alive, but if it's necessary
as a last resort, yes.

11:21.080 --> 11:23.000
Kill her if we have to. Let's go.

11:23.080 --> 11:26.480
Yee-haw! We're goin' huntin'!

11:56.240 --> 11:59.360
The guests in the private dining room
already arrived. Serve them some bread.

11:59.440 --> 12:01.240
-They're important people.
-Right away.

12:04.440 --> 12:07.960
On my way here, I thought,
"Another year, what do you say?"

12:08.960 --> 12:10.440
Don't speak German.

12:10.520 --> 12:12.920
You've been here for ten years
and you still don't understand

12:13.000 --> 12:14.800
that you need to stop talking
like a foreigner.

12:14.880 --> 12:16.440
Oooh!

12:16.520 --> 12:19.880
I can barely understand you either,
after you've had a couple of drinks.

12:21.200 --> 12:23.640
Well, as I was saying,
while I was on my way here,

12:23.720 --> 12:27.000
I thought, "Here we are yet again
with the same old good friends."

12:28.160 --> 12:31.480
I mean, what else can we say about him?

12:32.360 --> 12:36.520
Today, the most important man in history
would be 73 years old.

12:36.600 --> 12:41.200
If it hadn't been for him,
our country would never have achieved

12:41.280 --> 12:43.360
the glory or the respect we deserved.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.120
He made us dream that it was possible.

12:46.960 --> 12:51.360
We are the ones in charge of realizing
his dream and making it come true.

12:51.440 --> 12:53.400
-Well said.
-Well said.

13:30.360 --> 13:31.200
Yes?

13:31.720 --> 13:33.680
Isabel, are you all right?

13:35.400 --> 13:36.760
Yes, I'll be right out.

14:00.240 --> 14:02.080
One minute and that'll be it.

14:02.160 --> 14:06.000
I wouldn't get too close if I were you,
because it won't be a very pretty sight.

14:43.040 --> 14:45.880
Let me.
I want to be the first one to try it.

14:49.320 --> 14:51.240
If Spain continues like this,

14:52.360 --> 14:54.640
selling out to the Yankees,
those Zionists,

14:54.720 --> 14:56.880
we're going to end up eating nothing
but rugelach.

14:56.960 --> 14:59.280
-Rugelach!
-Gentlemen, I think we're clear

14:59.360 --> 15:01.920
about the situation
that concerns us right now.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.080
You mean Eichmann?

15:03.760 --> 15:05.560
How long
has he been held in Israel?

15:05.640 --> 15:07.600
A whole year waiting to be hanged.

15:07.680 --> 15:09.760
That trial was a farce.
Everybody knows it.

15:09.840 --> 15:12.440
You can't take Eichmann
out of Argentina illegally

15:12.520 --> 15:14.520
and say that you're trying him
according to the law.

15:14.600 --> 15:15.440
Come on.

15:15.520 --> 15:18.840
My friends,
let's not speculate on Eichmann's fate.

15:18.920 --> 15:22.520
The Jews had the knife
in their teeth from the very beginning.

15:22.600 --> 15:24.680
We need to remain calm.

15:31.400 --> 15:33.960
Let us pray to the Führer
on this special day

15:34.480 --> 15:37.800
that he may guide us
with a watchful eye wherever he may be.

15:38.840 --> 15:39.720
Enjoy.

15:39.800 --> 15:41.600
Enjoy.

16:33.040 --> 16:33.960
What's wrong?

16:35.920 --> 16:38.640
Go get a bottle of dessert wine.
Come on, move it.

17:08.120 --> 17:09.480
What are you doing?

17:09.560 --> 17:11.280
I'm not feeling well. I need to go home.

17:11.360 --> 17:14.640
I want you here first thing
tomorrow morning. And no excuses!

17:14.720 --> 17:17.280
Let's go to Florida!
That's where they know

17:17.360 --> 17:19.280
-how to close a deal.
-Yeah!

17:20.480 --> 17:22.760
Gentlemen,
one can make deals at night,

17:22.840 --> 17:26.520
but they aren't closed until after
a cup of strong coffee in the morning.

17:58.760 --> 17:59.680
Don't move.

18:01.440 --> 18:04.640
You're not gonna scream.
And you're not gonna turn around and--

18:24.440 --> 18:26.120
Don't move, damn it.

21:34.600 --> 21:35.440
Shit.

22:45.920 --> 22:46.800
Who's there?

22:47.640 --> 22:48.480
Who's there?

22:54.040 --> 22:54.880
Let me go!

22:57.480 --> 22:58.560
Shh. Shh.

23:01.280 --> 23:02.280
Untie me!

23:02.760 --> 23:04.600
Why were you following those men?

23:04.680 --> 23:07.720
I don't know what you're talking about.
Untie me! I said untie me!

23:20.080 --> 23:21.160
Who are you?

23:22.600 --> 23:24.720
-Tell me your name.
-Isabel Sánchez García.

23:24.800 --> 23:26.000
Tell me the truth. Now.

23:28.720 --> 23:30.480
My name is Isabel Sánchez García.

23:30.560 --> 23:33.400
-I live at 22 Salitre Street--
-My partner isn't as patient as I am.

23:33.480 --> 23:36.240
-He'll make you regret lying.
-I live at 22 Salitre Street

23:36.320 --> 23:37.200
with my parents.

23:44.880 --> 23:47.520
I'll ask you one more time,
and you'd better tell me the truth.

23:47.600 --> 23:50.760
If you don't, I swear this is going
to hurt. I'll count to three.

23:50.840 --> 23:52.480
My name is Isabel Sánchez García.

23:52.560 --> 23:54.920
-I live at 22 Salitre St. with my parents.
-What is your name?

23:55.000 --> 23:57.480
-One, two, three.
-I live at 22 Salitre Street!

24:17.040 --> 24:19.120
Carmen did a good job,
didn't she?

24:22.600 --> 24:24.000
Sweet anisette diluted with water.

24:25.000 --> 24:27.440
Did you think we were gonna
let you poison him?

24:28.400 --> 24:30.720
But with the pistol,
you almost screwed things up.

24:31.920 --> 24:34.000
Where did you get this from?

24:34.520 --> 24:36.000
-It's not mine.
-Is that true?

24:36.080 --> 24:39.440
The magazine holds eight bullets. Do you
know how many bullets are left in it?

24:52.560 --> 24:55.720
Your name is Isabel, that much is true.
But your surnames are Riaza Chacón.

24:55.800 --> 24:58.000
French passport,
issued in Angoulême, France.

24:59.440 --> 25:00.720
Who are you?

25:01.840 --> 25:03.280
Hmm? Who are you?

25:03.880 --> 25:05.600
The man you were following, Otto Bachmann…

25:06.320 --> 25:07.600
I wasn't following anyone.

25:08.880 --> 25:11.960
It bothers me that you're lying to me,
because you're wasting my time,

25:12.040 --> 25:15.320
and I've wasted too much time already.

25:19.000 --> 25:20.080
Look, Is.

25:21.160 --> 25:22.000
There it is.

25:25.920 --> 25:29.160
"You witness many things in life."
My grandfather would say that.

25:35.440 --> 25:37.360
And those eyes have witnessed too much.

25:42.400 --> 25:43.240
Cigarette?

25:46.240 --> 25:49.200
-I don't smoke.
-See? Now you're telling the truth.

26:00.680 --> 26:03.120
Tell me something.
How did you survive in Mauthausen?

26:04.640 --> 26:07.880
In Mauthausen, only the men were allowed
to stay. Women were taken to…

26:08.480 --> 26:10.360
Where was it, Marsé? Ravensbrück, right?

26:12.480 --> 26:15.560
-You were only a little girl when you--
-Whatever you're gonna do to me, do it.

26:18.080 --> 26:19.360
So why Bachmann?

26:20.120 --> 26:21.520
Because he killed my father.

26:30.280 --> 26:33.160
Keep a close eye on her. If she tries
anything, you know what to do.

26:33.240 --> 26:34.280
Can I go now?

26:44.080 --> 26:44.960
Can I go?

27:26.680 --> 27:30.040
Look at the wild boar.
What do you think it was thinking?

27:30.560 --> 27:32.960
Fear never lets you think.

27:35.040 --> 27:36.280
It was close, right?

27:36.360 --> 27:38.880
They would've killed her
as soon as she fired her gun.

27:39.960 --> 27:42.160
That's true,
but she would've achieved her goal.

27:44.000 --> 27:45.960
The truth is, it would take a lot of guts

27:46.040 --> 27:48.720
to point a pistol at that rat
in the center of Madrid.

27:48.800 --> 27:51.440
Yeah, well, either that
or you'd have to be crazy.

27:52.600 --> 27:55.760
What do you want us do with her?
We've been following her for weeks now.

27:55.840 --> 27:56.760
She's alone.

27:57.560 --> 27:59.680
How do you think she knows Bachmann?

28:00.960 --> 28:03.200
We have no photographs of these Nazis.

28:04.480 --> 28:07.120
If we are finally going to arrest
all these bastards,

28:07.200 --> 28:09.440
we will need someone
who's actually seen them

28:09.520 --> 28:12.200
-to recognize and identify them.
-That's true.

28:13.320 --> 28:16.560
But what she intends to do is quite
different from what we're trying to do.

28:17.600 --> 28:20.320
-Teach her how to use her head.
-I don't want dead weight.

28:20.400 --> 28:23.200
She didn't open her mouth
during the interrogation.

28:23.280 --> 28:24.840
But I don't trust her, Ramos.

28:29.120 --> 28:30.600
When I was a little girl,

28:31.480 --> 28:34.080
my father really enjoyed
taking us into the woods.

28:34.680 --> 28:36.920
One day, we found a baby fox.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.200
It couldn't have been
more than a few weeks old.

28:39.800 --> 28:42.760
I begged my father
to let me take it home with us.

28:44.160 --> 28:48.080
But he said that foxes
are unreliable animals.

28:49.280 --> 28:51.560
He hit it on the head
with one of the stakes

28:52.920 --> 28:53.840
and killed it.

28:54.880 --> 28:57.720
I'm still convinced that
if he'd allowed me to keep it…

28:59.040 --> 29:00.640
I would have managed to tame it.

29:09.840 --> 29:11.160
But what if you're wrong?

29:14.360 --> 29:17.720
In that case,
you'll prove that my father was right,

29:19.200 --> 29:22.560
and you will never have to
ask me what to do with her again.

29:37.680 --> 29:39.400
A bit late for cooking lunch.

29:39.480 --> 29:40.520
Was it tasty?

29:41.600 --> 29:43.320
-Castro…
-What are you doing?

29:43.400 --> 29:46.160
-What do you think? We're having lunch.
-Where's the girl?

29:46.240 --> 29:49.640
-Didn't I tell you not to leave her alone?
-She's tied up. How could she escape?

29:50.160 --> 29:52.440
Besides,
the old man is watching her.

29:56.400 --> 29:57.240
Hmm.

29:57.760 --> 29:59.640
The picture of your father. Give it to me.

30:00.560 --> 30:01.400
What for?

30:06.000 --> 30:07.520
Be careful with it.

30:21.800 --> 30:23.400
What are you drawing?

30:27.360 --> 30:28.520
Well, I don't know yet.

30:30.960 --> 30:33.000
So how do you know
what you're gonna do, then?

30:35.200 --> 30:36.360
Huh.

30:58.680 --> 31:00.400
Does this mean I can go now?

31:04.040 --> 31:05.600
How do you think the Nazi high command

31:05.680 --> 31:07.880
managed to escape from Germany
after the war?

31:09.840 --> 31:12.800
Odessa. A network that helped the Nazis
escape from Germany

31:12.880 --> 31:15.040
through Spain or Italy
with the support of the Vatican.

31:15.920 --> 31:18.280
And from here
to Brazil, Chile, or Paraguay,

31:18.360 --> 31:20.680
where they live peacefully
with their new identities.

31:21.280 --> 31:23.200
Do you know who
the Odessa man in Spain is?

31:23.920 --> 31:26.880
-Otto Bachmann.
-All the more reason he should die, then.

31:26.960 --> 31:29.680
Yeah. You don't really think
it would take them a long time

31:29.760 --> 31:31.480
to find a replacement for Bachmann?

31:31.560 --> 31:34.200
By watching Bachmann, we control
the Nazis who pass through Spain.

31:34.280 --> 31:36.960
His freedom is the price we have to pay
to hunt down many others.

31:37.040 --> 31:37.960
Who do you work for?

31:38.040 --> 31:40.720
People like you, who aren't willing
to forget what those bastards did.

31:40.800 --> 31:42.120
And then what will you do?

31:42.720 --> 31:45.040
Once we hunt them down,
we'll bring them to justice.

31:45.120 --> 31:46.920
What justice will you get in this country?

31:47.000 --> 31:49.560
International justice, the courts
that condemned them at Nuremberg.

31:49.640 --> 31:51.000
If you'd seen the things I've seen,

31:51.080 --> 31:53.720
you'd know the only justice
these people deserve is death.

32:23.720 --> 32:26.040
What makes you think
we haven't seen the same things?

32:48.520 --> 32:52.960
This was published
on October 17, 1946 in the ABC newspaper.

32:53.560 --> 32:56.000
These men died anyway,
but make no mistake,.

32:56.080 --> 32:59.040
It was thanks to that trial
that the world knew who they were

32:59.120 --> 33:00.800
and the terrible things they'd done.

33:01.440 --> 33:04.400
If they had been shot in the back
in a park in Madrid as you intended,

33:04.480 --> 33:06.360
no one would know about their crimes.

33:06.440 --> 33:08.920
No one would have been ashamed
to show their faces.

33:13.120 --> 33:16.000
If we had tied up Bachmann,
we wouldn't know this either.

33:17.480 --> 33:20.840
Otto Bachmann is going
to help Aribert Heim escape through Spain.

33:27.400 --> 33:28.600
That's not Aribert Heim.

33:31.000 --> 33:32.000
How do you know?

33:33.240 --> 33:35.160
Because I know what he looks like.

33:36.480 --> 33:38.440
I know every officer who went in and out

33:38.520 --> 33:40.720
of Commander Ziereis's house
in Mauthausen.

33:42.160 --> 33:43.360
And that's not Heim.

33:44.080 --> 33:45.640
And I think we both know that.

33:49.880 --> 33:51.800
Tomorrow, nine o'clock,
Chamberí metro station.

33:51.880 --> 33:53.720
If you don't show up,
you turn down our offer.

33:53.800 --> 33:55.920
-What offer?
-Help us hunt down Aribert Heim.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.520
Make him pay for everything he did.

34:00.840 --> 34:01.680
Isabel.

34:03.240 --> 34:04.480
What do you see here?

34:07.800 --> 34:09.480
-A hand.
-Yeah.

34:10.840 --> 34:12.080
I see something else.

34:13.720 --> 34:16.120
This is what we can achieve
if we work together.

35:07.240 --> 35:10.760
I've been waiting 20 years to get revenge
on Bachmann and get justice for my father.

35:10.840 --> 35:12.960
You're either with us
or you're against us.

35:13.800 --> 35:14.840
You decide.

37:49.280 --> 37:50.440
Five minutes to go.

37:52.400 --> 37:54.640
-I bet three cigarettes she doesn't show.
-Me too.

37:54.720 --> 37:57.000
Honestly, that's the best thing
that could happen.

37:57.080 --> 37:59.240
I don't feel like
carrying her around with us.

37:59.320 --> 38:01.320
That woman survived in Mauthausen.

38:01.400 --> 38:03.400
She's been working
at the Haus restaurant for a year

38:03.480 --> 38:05.280
to hunt down
the man who killed her father.

38:05.840 --> 38:07.280
What the fuck have you done?

38:09.480 --> 38:11.760
What did this Heim guy do
to be so important?

38:13.320 --> 38:15.080
He was a doctor in Mauthausen.

38:15.160 --> 38:17.880
While he was there,
he tortured more than 300 Spaniards.

38:17.960 --> 38:20.560
He gave them injections of water,
phenol, and petroleum in the heart

38:20.640 --> 38:22.480
to see how long before they died.

38:23.000 --> 38:24.880
He operated and removed organs,

38:25.560 --> 38:27.760
without anesthesia, of course.

38:27.840 --> 38:31.000
Just to see how much pain
his victims could endure.

38:32.200 --> 38:34.240
Oh, yes, two boys about your age,

38:34.320 --> 38:36.240
he cut them open
while they were still alive.

38:36.320 --> 38:38.520
Then he decapitated them
and boiled their heads

38:38.600 --> 38:41.440
and skinned them
to use their skulls as paperweights.

38:44.360 --> 38:45.200
And that…

38:46.840 --> 38:47.840
that was Heim.

39:43.200 --> 39:45.800
All right, listen up.
If the information we have is correct,

39:45.880 --> 39:48.600
we only have a week to prepare
before Heim arrives in Spain.

39:49.280 --> 39:51.760
If that bastard crosses the border,
we'll get him.

39:53.200 --> 39:55.520
We'll make him pay
for everything he's done.

40:10.200 --> 40:12.360
EIGHT DAYS
UNTIL THE ARRIVAL OF ARIBERT HEIM

40:14.200 --> 40:18.360
IN MEMORY OF MILU CABRER
