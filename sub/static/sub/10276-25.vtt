00:00.134 --> 00:02.835
¶¶

00:09.377 --> 00:12.511
¶ I was a girl in the village
doing all right ¶

00:12.513 --> 00:14.780
¶ Then I became
a princess overnight ¶

00:14.782 --> 00:17.516
¶ Now I gotta figure out
how to do it right ¶

00:17.518 --> 00:19.852
¶ So much to learn
and see ¶

00:19.854 --> 00:22.488
¶ Up in the castle
with my new family ¶

00:22.490 --> 00:25.357
¶ In a school that's
just for royalty ¶

00:25.359 --> 00:29.328
¶ A whole enchanted world
is waiting for me ¶

00:29.330 --> 00:33.365
- ¶ I'm so excited to be ¶
- ¶ Sofia the first ¶

00:33.367 --> 00:36.368
¶ I'm finding out what
being royal's all about ¶

00:36.370 --> 00:38.037
¶ Sofia the first ¶

00:38.039 --> 00:40.472
¶ Making my way,
it's an adventure every day ¶

00:40.474 --> 00:42.875
¶ Sofia ¶

00:42.877 --> 00:45.377
- ¶ It's gonna be my time ¶
- ¶ Sofia ¶

00:45.379 --> 00:51.550
¶ To show them all
that I'm Sofia the first ¶

00:58.926 --> 01:01.326
( gasps ) I think
I see the lake.

01:01.328 --> 01:04.329
- FATHER: Ooh, it's just
like I remembered.
- AMBER: That's it?

01:04.331 --> 01:08.534
I wanted to stay home
and look for meteor
showers with my telescope.

01:08.536 --> 01:10.569
I wanted to go to
flying carpet camp
with Zandar.

01:10.571 --> 01:12.604
Oh, you kids are
going to love it here,

01:12.606 --> 01:14.940
just like your father
did at your age.

01:14.942 --> 01:16.708
When I first
went to camp,

01:16.710 --> 01:18.577
I wasn't sure
about it either.

01:18.579 --> 01:22.181
But before I knew it,
I was having the time
of my life!

01:33.294 --> 01:36.595
Don't worry, Dad.
I'll make sure
they love it here.

01:36.597 --> 01:38.397
Thank you, Sofia.

01:38.399 --> 01:40.365
Have a great time.

01:43.604 --> 01:45.037
Bye, Daddy.

01:47.141 --> 01:49.608
Guys, this is gonna
be so great.

01:49.610 --> 01:52.444
James, you get to try
tons of new activities

01:52.446 --> 01:54.580
that will be even better
than flying carpets.

01:54.582 --> 01:56.782
Some of this stuff
does like kind of okay.

01:56.784 --> 01:59.451
And we'll all get
to make new friends.

01:59.453 --> 02:01.787
Amber, you know
everyone will love you.

02:01.789 --> 02:04.223
It's true.
People do love me.

02:04.225 --> 02:07.626
Wilder welcome,
campers!

02:07.628 --> 02:10.395
That must be Maple and Marty,
the camp counselors.

02:10.397 --> 02:12.097
ALL: How do you do, Maple!

02:12.099 --> 02:16.969
Welcome, one and all,
to our peaceful
Wilderwood sanctuary.

02:16.971 --> 02:21.440
Here at camp, we have
over 50 enchanting activities.

02:21.442 --> 02:25.811
And over 500 species
of animals and plants

02:25.813 --> 02:27.646
that are even
more enchanting.

02:27.648 --> 02:29.448
Except for
the itching ivy.

02:29.450 --> 02:31.517
That is not so
enchanting.

02:31.519 --> 02:33.185
What's itching ivy?

02:33.187 --> 02:36.622
- I think it's... that.
- ( yells )

02:36.624 --> 02:38.924
It makes you really itchy
if you touch it, and it's
super contagious,

02:38.926 --> 02:40.592
so stay away from it!

02:40.594 --> 02:41.827
Huh. I thought we cleared
all the itching ivy

02:41.829 --> 02:45.364
from this area.
Sorry.

02:46.834 --> 02:48.634
All righty then.

02:48.636 --> 02:50.636
Let's kick off
this summer right.

02:50.638 --> 02:55.174
Everybody introduce yourself
to another camper.

02:55.176 --> 02:56.842
Here we go.

02:56.844 --> 02:58.310
Hi. I'm Mandy.

02:58.312 --> 03:00.479
Pleased to meet you, Mandy.

03:00.481 --> 03:02.314
And you are?

03:02.316 --> 03:03.549
You don't know
who I am?

03:03.551 --> 03:05.551
Uh, no.

03:05.553 --> 03:07.319
Hi. I'm Sofia,
and this is my sister Amber.

03:07.321 --> 03:09.488
It's our first
summer at camp.

03:09.490 --> 03:13.058
Mine, too. I could
hardly sleep last night,
I was so excited.

03:13.060 --> 03:15.661
- Me, too.
- ( both giggling )

03:15.663 --> 03:17.129
Hello. I'm James.

03:17.131 --> 03:20.332
No offense, but I'm
not shaking your hand.

03:20.334 --> 03:22.534
You're the kid who was
standing in itching ivy.

03:22.536 --> 03:24.136
I didn't even touch it.

03:24.138 --> 03:26.705
Yeah. I'm just gonna
go over there.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.774
Sorry.

03:31.679 --> 03:36.048
- Huh?
- Wendell?
- Yes. It's me.

03:36.050 --> 03:39.084
What is a wicked wizard
like you doing at summer camp?

03:39.086 --> 03:41.353
And what are you
planning to steal this time?

03:41.355 --> 03:43.522
Sadly, I'm not here
to steal anything.

03:43.524 --> 03:46.358
I don't have magic lute
or my wand.

03:46.360 --> 03:49.494
My parents took
all my good stuff away.

03:49.496 --> 03:50.662
Then why are you here?

03:50.664 --> 03:52.898
After I tried to steal
all your horses,

03:52.900 --> 03:56.568
I might've turned a pig
into a flying vicious pigasus.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.704
- Wow!
- That doesn't sound good.

03:58.706 --> 04:02.674
And then, I might have
taken over a kingdom.

04:02.676 --> 04:05.377
Just a small, out-of-the-way
kingdom, mind you,

04:05.379 --> 04:07.112
That's when Mum
and Dad decided

04:07.114 --> 04:09.114
grounding me
wasn't enough.

04:09.116 --> 04:12.217
So they forced me to come here
to this rubbish camp.

04:12.219 --> 04:14.620
They wanted me to see
that there are ways
to have fun

04:14.622 --> 04:17.389
"without being
naughty, Wendell."

04:17.391 --> 04:19.124
Whatever that means.

04:19.126 --> 04:21.593
Well, everyone deserves
a second chance.

04:21.595 --> 04:23.528
Or a tenth chance.

04:25.633 --> 04:29.768
Now we're about to begin
enchanted arts and crafts.

04:29.770 --> 04:32.137
Cozy up and find
a seat, campers.

04:32.139 --> 04:33.605
Oh, don't be shy.

04:33.607 --> 04:35.807
( kids chattering )

04:35.809 --> 04:37.943
That's the itchy kid.

04:37.945 --> 04:39.978
( kids whispering )

04:39.980 --> 04:41.780
This seat's taken.

04:41.782 --> 04:44.116
( whispering continues )

04:44.118 --> 04:46.218
Hey, I'm not
even itching.

04:46.220 --> 04:49.388
Give it time.
It's gonna happen.

04:49.390 --> 04:51.623
I don't wanna sit
over here anyway.

04:58.232 --> 05:01.033
Ahem. Who would like
to sit next to me?

05:02.336 --> 05:05.504
No one knows
who I am here.

05:05.506 --> 05:07.606
Sofia! Sit with me!

05:07.608 --> 05:08.907
Come on.

05:11.478 --> 05:13.812
Welcome to
silk weaving.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.647
With these enchanted
sew-and-sew spindles,

05:15.649 --> 05:17.749
you can weave anything.

05:17.751 --> 05:21.453
All it takes
is a flick of the wrist.

05:21.455 --> 05:24.823
Just picture an image,
and voila!

05:24.825 --> 05:27.959
Row, row, row your boat,
tiny campers.

05:27.961 --> 05:29.995
Oh, I could do this
for hours.

05:29.997 --> 05:32.197
Why, hello there,
fisherman.

05:32.199 --> 05:34.433
Meet the catch of the day.

05:41.442 --> 05:45.210
Why is it so easy
for Sofia to make friends?

05:45.212 --> 05:48.113
Wait a minute.
This stupid thing... oh!

05:48.115 --> 05:50.782
Ha! Look at James.

05:50.784 --> 05:52.517
( laughter )

05:52.519 --> 05:54.519
( frustrated groan )
Get off!

05:54.521 --> 05:56.688
Oh, no.

05:57.658 --> 05:59.658
Here. Let me
help you.

05:59.660 --> 06:01.293
I don't need
your help.

06:01.295 --> 06:02.794
I don't need
anyone's help.

06:02.796 --> 06:04.062
I don't even like
arts and crafts.

06:04.064 --> 06:06.498
I thought camp
was supposed to be fun.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.667
I'm sure the next
activity will be better.

06:08.669 --> 06:10.769
WENDELL: This is too easy.

06:11.739 --> 06:14.039
MAPLE: Our first climber
reaches the top.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.674
What a dismount!

06:15.676 --> 06:18.410
Here.
Give it a try.

06:20.681 --> 06:23.682
MAPLE: Our second
enchanted climber is
doing quite a nice job.

06:23.684 --> 06:25.517
Note he perfectly anticipates

06:25.519 --> 06:27.719
each magically
appearing handhold.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.054
What technique!

06:29.056 --> 06:31.156
This is exciting!

06:31.158 --> 06:33.558
Um, I think I'm
starting to feel...

06:33.560 --> 06:36.862
itchy.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

06:36.864 --> 06:38.563
That's gotta hurt.

06:38.565 --> 06:40.665
Luckily he had a cushion
to break his fall.

06:40.667 --> 06:43.535
- And a mud puddle.
- James! Are you all right?

06:43.537 --> 06:45.437
Does it look like
I'm all right?

06:45.439 --> 06:46.838
( campers laughing )

06:46.840 --> 06:48.440
All right, campers,
settle down.

06:48.442 --> 06:50.776
Just leave me
alone, Sofia.

07:00.954 --> 07:03.722
¶ I know you meant well,
Mom and Dad ¶

07:03.724 --> 07:06.358
¶ But trust me,
camp is really bad ¶

07:06.360 --> 07:10.762
¶ Uh-oh, uh-uh-oh ¶

07:10.764 --> 07:13.365
¶ I haven't made
a single friend ¶

07:13.367 --> 07:15.901
¶ When will the summer
ever end? ¶

07:15.903 --> 07:19.938
¶ Uh-oh, uh-uh-oh ¶

07:19.940 --> 07:23.041
¶ Can't do
one more activity ¶

07:23.043 --> 07:25.744
¶ Feels like
I'm in captivity ¶

07:25.746 --> 07:29.247
¶ Send a coach
to take me home ¶

07:29.249 --> 07:32.050
¶ I've got
the summer camp blues ¶

07:32.052 --> 07:34.453
¶ Too many rocks
in my shoes ¶

07:34.455 --> 07:36.388
¶ They can keep their canoes ¶

07:36.390 --> 07:38.757
¶ 'Cause I've got
the blues ¶

07:38.759 --> 07:41.126
¶ The summer camp blues ¶

07:41.128 --> 07:43.995
¶ Uh-oh, uh-uh-oh ¶

07:43.997 --> 07:46.798
¶ I ran into
a stinky skunk ¶

07:46.800 --> 07:49.935
¶ A wicked wizard
shares my bunk ¶

07:49.937 --> 07:53.972
¶ Uh-oh, uh-uh-oh ¶

07:53.974 --> 07:56.775
¶ Got itching ivy everywhere ¶

07:56.777 --> 07:59.411
¶ I look so weird,
the kids all stare ¶

07:59.413 --> 08:03.448
¶ Uh-oh, uh-uh-oh ¶

08:03.450 --> 08:06.284
¶ Each day, I feel
so miserable ¶

08:06.286 --> 08:08.987
¶ I wish I were
invisible ¶

08:08.989 --> 08:12.791
¶ Please send a coach
to take me home ¶

08:12.793 --> 08:15.260
¶ I've got
the summer camp blues ¶

08:15.262 --> 08:17.496
¶ I really need
some good news ¶

08:17.498 --> 08:20.098
¶ There is no time
to lose ¶

08:20.100 --> 08:22.601
¶ I've got the blues ¶

08:22.603 --> 08:24.636
¶ My hiking pack
weighs a ton ¶

08:24.638 --> 08:26.805
¶ The campfire's
hot as the sun ¶

08:26.807 --> 08:29.474
¶ My s'mores got
way overdone ¶

08:29.476 --> 08:32.010
¶ I've got the blues ¶

08:32.012 --> 08:33.879
¶ The summer camp blues ¶

08:33.881 --> 08:35.347
¶ Uh-oh, uh-uh-oh ¶

08:37.885 --> 08:41.319
¶ All I wanna do ¶

08:41.321 --> 08:44.122
¶ Is go home to you ¶

08:44.124 --> 08:47.492
¶ 'Cause I've got ¶

08:47.494 --> 08:53.865
¶ The summer camp blues ¶

08:53.867 --> 08:56.768
Love, James.

09:01.008 --> 09:02.908
( bell ringing )

09:04.678 --> 09:06.711
Sofia, I hear Maple and Marty
are making

09:06.713 --> 09:09.080
a huge announcement
after breakfast.

09:09.082 --> 09:10.982
Oh. Do you know
what it is?

09:10.984 --> 09:13.685
No idea, but come sit
with me and we can make guesses.

09:13.687 --> 09:16.721
Great. Amber and I will
be right over.

09:16.723 --> 09:20.158
Um, Amber.
What's wrong?

09:20.160 --> 09:22.060
She asked for you,
not me.

09:22.062 --> 09:25.263
Everyone is usually
lining up to make
friends with me.

09:25.265 --> 09:27.232
No one's doing that here.

09:27.234 --> 09:29.234
I don't know how I'm
supposed to make friends

09:29.236 --> 09:31.870
if I have to do it myself.

09:31.872 --> 09:33.371
Why don't you try talking
to the other campers?

09:33.373 --> 09:35.707
See what you have
in common.

09:35.709 --> 09:39.544
It would be a lot easier if
the other campers would
come and talk to me.

09:39.546 --> 09:42.080
I know, but things
are different here.

09:42.082 --> 09:44.382
Uh-oh.

09:44.384 --> 09:46.184
I better go see
what's wrong with James.

09:47.588 --> 09:49.888
James, what are you
doing out here?

09:49.890 --> 09:51.556
Why aren't you
at breakfast?

09:51.558 --> 09:54.092
I'm not going to breakfast
here ever again.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.927
I'm going home.

09:55.929 --> 09:57.929
What? What are you
talking about?

09:57.931 --> 09:59.531
As soon as Dad
gets this letter,

09:59.533 --> 10:01.266
he's gonna come
pick me up.

10:01.268 --> 10:04.736
James, I know you've been
having kind of a rough time,

10:04.738 --> 10:07.038
but it's just
the beginning of camp.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.106
Things will get better.

10:08.108 --> 10:10.875
Not for me, Sofia.

10:10.877 --> 10:13.044
Come on. I hear the activity
they're about to announce

10:13.046 --> 10:15.080
is the best.

10:15.082 --> 10:17.782
Before you send that letter,
just come to the announcement.

10:17.784 --> 10:19.451
There's some great stuff
coming up.

10:19.453 --> 10:20.952
You can still have fun.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.253
Please.

10:22.255 --> 10:23.989
Please!

10:23.991 --> 10:26.157
( sighs )
Okay, okay.

10:26.159 --> 10:28.493
Great.

10:28.495 --> 10:31.963
( horn blowing fanfare )

10:31.965 --> 10:36.101
It's time to start this year's
inter-camp competition.

10:36.103 --> 10:37.936
( cheering )

10:37.938 --> 10:39.938
Once again, Camp Wilderwood
will take on

10:39.940 --> 10:42.240
the camp next door.

10:42.242 --> 10:44.342
MARTY: The Junior Knights.

10:44.344 --> 10:47.345
In our annual flag race.

10:47.347 --> 10:49.748
Teams from each camp
compete to be the first

10:49.750 --> 10:52.517
to plant their camp's flag
on that island.

10:52.519 --> 10:55.487
And I really feel like
this is the summer

10:55.489 --> 10:58.757
we are finally
going to win.

10:58.759 --> 11:01.626
You mean Camp Wilderwood
has never won?

11:01.628 --> 11:04.829
- No.
- But that just
means we're due.

11:04.831 --> 11:07.632
Uh, how are we supposed
to get to the island?

11:07.634 --> 11:10.769
That, young campers,
is entirely up to you,

11:10.771 --> 11:13.972
and your infinite
imaginations.

11:13.974 --> 11:15.840
But you will not have to
imagine alone.

11:15.842 --> 11:18.143
You will each be teaming up
with a camp buddy,

11:18.145 --> 11:20.779
and each buddy team
has until tomorrow morning

11:20.781 --> 11:23.214
to build a boat,
raft, or anything else

11:23.216 --> 11:25.150
you can think of to get
you to that island

11:25.152 --> 11:26.985
as fast as possible.

11:26.987 --> 11:28.887
So, everybody,
buddy up!

11:33.026 --> 11:35.960
Well, chum, guess
it's just you and me left.

11:35.962 --> 11:38.730
The wicked wizard
and the kid with
itching ivy.

11:38.732 --> 11:41.833
I really didn't think camp
could get any worse.

11:41.835 --> 11:43.535
Tell me about it.

11:43.537 --> 11:45.704
There is nothing good
about this camp.

11:45.706 --> 11:47.338
At least you didn't
get itching ivy.

11:47.340 --> 11:49.340
At least you didn't get
a bellyache

11:49.342 --> 11:52.010
from eating an entire
tray of cookies.

11:52.012 --> 11:54.512
Sofia! Wanna be
my camp buddy?

11:54.514 --> 11:57.015
Actually, I was thinking that
maybe you and Amber

11:57.017 --> 11:58.917
would make good buddies.

11:58.919 --> 12:00.385
BOTH: Oh! You were?

12:00.387 --> 12:02.554
Yeah. I know once you
talk to each other,

12:02.556 --> 12:05.023
you'll see you have
so much in common.

12:05.025 --> 12:06.591
Well, I really like
silk weaving,

12:06.593 --> 12:09.194
- and you do,
too, right?
- I love it.

12:09.196 --> 12:11.429
Then maybe we could make
our whole raft for the race

12:11.431 --> 12:12.997
out of sew-and-sew
silk weaving.

12:12.999 --> 12:15.033
That's a genius idea!

12:15.035 --> 12:17.202
We're gonna make
the best buddies.
Thank you, Sofia.

12:17.204 --> 12:18.570
You're welcome.

12:18.572 --> 12:19.904
I'm gonna go see
how James is doing.

12:19.906 --> 12:22.273
Well, I think
he found a buddy.

12:22.275 --> 12:24.175
Oh. How about that?

12:24.177 --> 12:27.011
I haven't slept one night
with all those crickets

12:27.013 --> 12:29.047
chirping in my ear.

12:29.049 --> 12:30.849
At least you didn't
fall in a creek.

12:30.851 --> 12:34.285
This camp is
absolute rubbish.

12:34.287 --> 12:37.122
Complete and
absolute rubbish.

12:37.124 --> 12:40.258
( blowing fanfare )

12:40.260 --> 12:44.429
All right, campers,
it's time to get building!

12:44.431 --> 12:46.965
Come on, Mandy.
Let's go to arts and crafts.

12:50.203 --> 12:53.371
Huh. I guess now
I need a buddy.

12:53.373 --> 12:56.374
So, camp buddy,
what do you wanna build?

12:56.376 --> 12:59.377
Ugh. How about a lifeboat
to save us from this camp?

12:59.379 --> 13:02.113
Yeah. Too bad we can't
make a boat to take us home

13:02.115 --> 13:03.882
instead of to that island.

13:03.884 --> 13:06.117
Who says we can't?

13:06.119 --> 13:08.486
- Do you mean...
- Oh, yeah.

13:08.488 --> 13:11.256
Brilliant. We should
totally do that.

13:11.258 --> 13:13.725
Everyone will think
we're racing to the island,

13:13.727 --> 13:16.261
but then, boom, we turn around
right in the middle of the race,

13:16.263 --> 13:17.295
and head for home.

13:17.297 --> 13:18.963
We must do it.

13:18.965 --> 13:20.832
Oh, we're doing it.

13:35.282 --> 13:37.348
Well done, us.

13:48.295 --> 13:51.095
Hey, do you guys
need any help?

13:51.097 --> 13:52.330
No, thanks.
We're good.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.199
Um, okay.

13:55.468 --> 13:58.770
Hi. I don't suppose
you need an extra hand
with that.

13:58.772 --> 14:00.338
Um, no, thank you.

14:05.212 --> 14:07.345
Wow, James.
Your boat looks incredible.

14:07.347 --> 14:09.514
Thanks, but it's not
quite finished.

14:09.516 --> 14:13.351
Right. We still have to get
a sail big enough to take us...

14:13.353 --> 14:15.186
To the island.
Right, Wendell?

14:15.188 --> 14:16.955
Right. To the island.

14:16.957 --> 14:19.524
Looks like Wendell's
turned out to be
a great camp buddy.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.860
( sighs )
You're lucky, James.

14:29.336 --> 14:30.802
How about you?

14:30.804 --> 14:32.503
You wanna be
my camp buddy?

14:32.505 --> 14:35.173
- Sofia, over here.
- Hey.

14:35.175 --> 14:37.308
Your raft is sure
looking good.

14:37.310 --> 14:40.578
I know, but that's not
why I called you over here.

14:40.580 --> 14:42.146
Do you not have a buddy?

14:42.148 --> 14:44.515
Uh, not really.

14:44.517 --> 14:46.751
( gasps ) You gave up
your only camp friend

14:46.753 --> 14:48.219
so I could have a buddy?

14:48.221 --> 14:50.021
And now you have no one?

14:50.023 --> 14:51.422
It's okay, Amber.

14:51.424 --> 14:53.358
No, it's not.

14:53.360 --> 14:56.561
You were so worried about
making sure James and I
were happy,

14:56.563 --> 14:58.830
that you forgot
all about yourself.

14:58.832 --> 15:00.498
I guess I did.

15:00.500 --> 15:03.668
Well, now it's my turn
to make sure you're happy here.

15:03.670 --> 15:05.703
You can be buddies
with us.

15:05.705 --> 15:07.672
- Right, Mandy?
- That would be great!

15:07.674 --> 15:11.276
But camp buddies are supposed
to be teams of two, not three.

15:11.278 --> 15:14.045
Well, that was before
I got to this camp,

15:14.047 --> 15:16.014
and I say
there can be three buddies.

15:16.016 --> 15:17.282
So do I.

15:17.284 --> 15:20.218
What do you say, Sofia?
Wanna join us?

15:20.220 --> 15:22.220
Thanks. I'd love to.
How can I help?

15:22.222 --> 15:24.222
Our raft already
looks great.

15:24.224 --> 15:26.090
Now we just have to make
sure it'll float.

15:28.361 --> 15:30.962
Hm. I think I've
got an idea.

15:30.964 --> 15:33.298
All we need
are a few of these.

15:36.970 --> 15:38.403
Look at that flag.

15:38.405 --> 15:40.371
It's a perfect sail
for our boat.

15:40.373 --> 15:42.240
The Camp Wilderwood flag?

15:42.242 --> 15:43.775
Wendell, we can't
take that.

15:43.777 --> 15:45.243
Sure, we can, James.

15:45.245 --> 15:47.245
Look, we'll send it back
once we get home.

15:47.247 --> 15:49.113
I promise.

15:49.115 --> 15:53.217
All we have to do
is get past one sleeping fairy.

15:53.219 --> 15:55.987
( snoring )

15:55.989 --> 15:57.655
Okay. Let's do it.

16:05.098 --> 16:06.564
( Maple muttering )

16:06.566 --> 16:08.132
Camp Wilderwood
is neck and neck

16:08.134 --> 16:11.102
with the Junior Knights.

16:11.104 --> 16:12.437
It's just a dream.

16:12.439 --> 16:15.173
She's sleep-talking.

16:34.761 --> 16:37.962
( yells )
Oh, no.

16:37.964 --> 16:41.466
That's right, we caught up to
you, you stuffy Junior Knights.

16:41.468 --> 16:43.368
( snoring resumes )

16:43.370 --> 16:45.370
Still dreaming.

16:45.372 --> 16:49.173
( muttering and snoring
continues )

16:49.175 --> 16:52.043
Quick. Let's get it
before we're really caught.

16:52.045 --> 16:55.380
And Wilderwood wins
for the first time

16:55.382 --> 16:58.216
in camp history.

17:09.529 --> 17:12.363
Volleyballs?
Great idea.

17:12.365 --> 17:14.966
Thanks. We have
a brilliant buddy.

17:14.968 --> 17:19.537
James, I can't believe
you made such an amazing boat.

17:19.539 --> 17:21.506
Yep. With our own
four hands.

17:21.508 --> 17:23.141
We'll see you
after the race.

17:23.143 --> 17:24.976
Right. See you then.

17:24.978 --> 17:27.645
Campers,
this is the day

17:27.647 --> 17:30.415
you've all
been waiting for.

17:30.417 --> 17:33.651
The inter-camp flag race
against the Junior Knights.

17:33.653 --> 17:36.220
( all cheering )

17:36.222 --> 17:39.057
Before we get started,
it has come to my attention

17:39.059 --> 17:41.759
that the official
Camp Wilderwood flag

17:41.761 --> 17:43.995
has gone missing
from the flagpole.

17:43.997 --> 17:47.031
None of you campers would know
anything about that,

17:47.033 --> 17:48.499
now, would you?

17:48.501 --> 17:50.568
All right then.

17:50.570 --> 17:52.437
We'll get into
that later.

17:52.439 --> 17:55.506
Now, it's time to race!

17:55.508 --> 17:58.443
Now, everyone listen for
the sound of the starting horn,

17:58.445 --> 18:00.545
and get ready to launch.

18:00.547 --> 18:04.515
MAPLE: Racers, to your
starting lines.

18:04.517 --> 18:06.517
Okay, everything's ready.

18:06.519 --> 18:08.619
Home, here we come.

18:08.621 --> 18:10.588
( blowing fanfare )

18:10.590 --> 18:12.690
MAPLE: And they're off!

18:12.692 --> 18:16.594
- The teams are
neck and neck.
- See ya.

18:16.596 --> 18:20.064
MAPLE: Wait. Camp Wilderwood
is taking the lead.

18:20.066 --> 18:21.899
So long, campers.

18:21.901 --> 18:24.602
Hey, Maple, isn't that
the missing camp flag?

18:24.604 --> 18:28.272
I suppose I shouldn't
let them get away with that,

18:28.274 --> 18:30.041
but we're winning!

18:30.043 --> 18:31.542
It's working.

18:31.544 --> 18:34.078
We're home free!

18:34.080 --> 18:36.481
Wow! Look at James go!

18:36.483 --> 18:39.617
Yes, but it looks
like he's headed
in the wrong direction.

18:40.987 --> 18:42.453
We've run aground.

18:42.455 --> 18:45.256
James, help us!

18:45.258 --> 18:48.426
- Are you okay?
- AMBER: No, James,
we are very much not okay.

18:48.428 --> 18:50.761
I think we better
lower the sail and turn around.

18:50.763 --> 18:52.630
What are you
talking about?

18:52.632 --> 18:55.266
Just a little further,
and we can sail right home.

18:55.268 --> 18:58.603
I know, but...
my sisters are in trouble.

18:58.605 --> 19:00.304
That's their problem.

19:00.306 --> 19:02.406
Wendell, I'm not
leaving them behind.

19:02.408 --> 19:05.510
SOFIA: Hurry!
We're sinking! Help!

19:07.113 --> 19:08.779
Hurry, Amber.

19:08.781 --> 19:10.414
There. That should do it.

19:10.416 --> 19:12.583
SOFIA: James, catch.

19:12.585 --> 19:15.353
They're going to ruin
our plan.

19:15.355 --> 19:17.155
( straining )

19:17.157 --> 19:18.756
We'll just bring 'em
back to camp,

19:18.758 --> 19:20.491
and then we'll go home.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.560
Ugh. Fine.

19:25.965 --> 19:27.231
Thanks.

19:28.468 --> 19:31.602
Hey, campers,
you better get moving.

19:31.604 --> 19:33.771
The Junior Knights
are catching up.

19:36.843 --> 19:38.876
There's still time
to win the race.
Come on, James.

19:38.878 --> 19:40.545
We have to get
to the island.

19:40.547 --> 19:42.513
We're not going
to the island.

19:42.515 --> 19:43.981
We're taking you
back to camp,

19:43.983 --> 19:45.850
and then, we're
sailing home.

19:45.852 --> 19:47.518
- What?
- Why would you do that?

19:47.520 --> 19:50.121
I know you love
camp, Sofia,
but I don't.

19:50.123 --> 19:52.290
It's just not for me.

19:52.292 --> 19:54.292
But you looked like you were
having so much fun

19:54.294 --> 19:55.726
making your boat.

19:55.728 --> 19:57.695
I still don't
like it here.

19:57.697 --> 19:59.030
No one will be
friends with me.

19:59.032 --> 20:00.865
Um, what about Wendell?

20:00.867 --> 20:03.968
Me? Oh, I don't
have any friends.

20:03.970 --> 20:05.703
Well, what about James?

20:05.705 --> 20:07.538
Hm. She's right.

20:07.540 --> 20:10.508
You mean we're
actually... friends?

20:10.510 --> 20:13.578
- I guess we are.
- We can still
win this race!

20:13.580 --> 20:15.880
- What do you say, guys?
- I'm in.

20:15.882 --> 20:19.383
Come on, Wendell. It won't be
the same without you.

20:19.385 --> 20:21.986
I guess if you're doing it,
I'm in, too.

20:21.988 --> 20:24.355
For Camp Wilderwood!

20:24.357 --> 20:25.856
ALL: Camp Wilderwood!

20:25.858 --> 20:28.526
MAPLE: Hurry up.
You're our last hope.

20:28.528 --> 20:30.861
The honor of Camp Wilderwood

20:30.863 --> 20:34.732
rests entirely on
your shoulders.

20:34.734 --> 20:36.567
Everybody pull!

20:36.569 --> 20:39.704
MAPLE: It looks like
it's neck and neck.

20:39.706 --> 20:41.505
Oh, this is exciting!

20:41.507 --> 20:44.075
It's going to be close.

20:44.077 --> 20:46.544
We're doing it.
We're winning!

20:46.546 --> 20:50.681
MAPLE: And Camp Wilderwood
takes the lead once again!

20:50.683 --> 20:52.750
We did it!

20:52.752 --> 20:54.352
We haven't won yet.

20:54.354 --> 20:56.721
We still have to plant
the Wilderwood flag.

20:56.723 --> 20:59.957
But ours went down
with our boat.

20:59.959 --> 21:01.792
JAMES: Don't worry.
We got this.

21:05.565 --> 21:06.931
MAPLE: And the Junior Knights
have their flag.

21:06.933 --> 21:08.633
They're racing
across the beach.

21:08.635 --> 21:10.601
Camp Wilderwood
jumps ahead of them.

21:10.603 --> 21:14.038
It's a steep climb,
and neither of the teams
are slowing down.

21:20.580 --> 21:22.113
- Yes!
- We did it!

21:22.115 --> 21:24.582
Camp Wilderwood wins!

21:24.584 --> 21:28.619
Next time you wanna
borrow the camp flag,
just ask.

21:28.621 --> 21:31.555
- Okay.
- Sorry.

21:31.557 --> 21:33.224
( cheering )

21:33.226 --> 21:36.294
Let's hear it for
our Wilderwood champions!

21:36.296 --> 21:40.364
( cheering continues )

21:45.505 --> 21:47.672
I love camp.

21:49.742 --> 21:52.810
- Our heroes!
- Yay, James and Wendell!

21:52.812 --> 21:56.614
Now, who would like to join me
in celebrating this historic,

21:56.616 --> 21:59.950
wonderful victory
with some campfire cookies?

21:59.952 --> 22:01.852
I do. Yeah!

22:03.756 --> 22:06.624
So, are you guys gonna
go escape from camp,

22:06.626 --> 22:08.693
or are you coming to
the mess hall for cookies?

22:08.695 --> 22:10.361
