00:00.201 --> 00:03.902
     <i> My name is liv moore,</i>
     <i> and i died, sort of.</i>

00:03.904 --> 00:06.605
    <i> I had a promising career</i>
    <i> and a great fiance.</i>

00:06.607 --> 00:09.508
 <i> Then i went to the world's</i>
 <i> worst boat party</i>
 <i> and got turned into a zombie.</i>

00:09.510 --> 00:11.710
    <i> Now i work at the morgue</i>
    <i> for access to brains,</i>

00:11.712 --> 00:13.579
       <i> But brain eating</i>
       <i> has side effects.</i>

00:13.581 --> 00:15.414
     <i> I take on the victim's</i>
     <i> personality traits</i>

00:15.416 --> 00:18.217
  <i> And have visions which i use</i>
  <i> to help solve their murders.</i>

00:18.219 --> 00:20.352
    <i> I work with a detective</i>
    <i> who thinks i'm a psychic</i>

00:20.354 --> 00:22.054
     <i> And my boss,</i>
     <i> the medical examiner,</i>

00:22.056 --> 00:24.156
      <i> The only person</i>
      <i> who knows my secret.</i>

00:24.158 --> 00:25.624
  <i> I'm a crime-fighting zombie.</i>

00:25.626 --> 00:27.159
    <i> Previously on</i> izombie...

00:27.161 --> 00:29.561
      Are you sure about
      being the only one?

00:29.563 --> 00:31.563
   It's one of the things
   that keeps me up at night.

00:31.565 --> 00:33.165
      <i> That zombie,</i>
      <i> haunting my dreams,</i>

00:34.468 --> 00:35.734
        <i> He's out there.</i>

00:39.607 --> 00:42.608
  I'm saying it would be nice
  if just once he would call.

00:42.610 --> 00:44.410
       You know how he is
       when he's working.

00:44.412 --> 00:45.944
       No sense of time.

00:45.946 --> 00:47.413
            Javier?

00:47.415 --> 00:49.481
   You missed a great dinner.

00:49.483 --> 00:51.150
          (screaming)

00:51.152 --> 00:52.351
             Lola!

00:52.353 --> 00:53.886
         (lola sobbing)

00:59.060 --> 01:01.193
      (theme song playing)

01:24.118 --> 01:25.918
       Cause of death...

01:25.920 --> 01:27.719
    I assume we're going
    with drowning, correct?

01:29.690 --> 01:32.057
      So, he was
      a well-known artist?

01:32.059 --> 01:33.392
         Javier abano?

01:33.394 --> 01:35.094
       Oh, his paintings
       are very popular.

01:35.096 --> 01:36.161
        Who doesn't love

01:36.163 --> 01:37.229
   A vibrant, abstract nude?

01:37.231 --> 01:40.032
     Hint, she eats brains.

01:40.034 --> 01:41.467
   It looks like he was just
   trying to show off

01:41.469 --> 01:43.268
   How many different colors
   of paint he owned.

01:43.270 --> 01:44.636
      Oh, i love his work.

01:44.638 --> 01:45.771
  I particularly enjoy the one

01:45.773 --> 01:47.406
     That looks like
     a bright blue jacksy.

01:47.408 --> 01:49.741
 But i like my art provocative
 with a tinge of whimsy.

01:49.743 --> 01:52.744
 -Okay, that's enough for now.
 Okay, detective?
 -(lola sobbing)

01:52.746 --> 01:54.980
      Ravi: Also, blue is
      my favorite color.

01:54.982 --> 01:57.182
 And i'm a bit of an arse man.

01:57.184 --> 01:58.884
       Overshare, right?

01:58.886 --> 02:00.719
      Got anything for me?

02:02.123 --> 02:03.288
            Well...

02:03.290 --> 02:04.690
     Based on the stiffness
     of the jaw and neck,

02:04.692 --> 02:06.558
   I'd put the time of death
   between 6:00 and 7:00 p.M.

02:06.560 --> 02:08.759
 No defense wounds.
 No physical signs of struggle.

02:08.762 --> 02:10.229
    It's a straight shot
    from the orbital cavity

02:10.231 --> 02:12.898
 To the carotid artery so death
 was likely instantaneous.

02:12.900 --> 02:14.233
  Like pushing an off button.

02:14.235 --> 02:15.434
         Well, stabbing
         an off button

02:15.436 --> 02:16.702
     That's located
     behind someone's eye,

02:16.704 --> 02:19.671
        Using the handle
        of a paintbrush.

02:19.673 --> 02:21.240
 I'll know more when i get him
 back to the morgue.

02:21.242 --> 02:22.307
      And what about you?

02:23.177 --> 02:24.977
 Anything you'd like to share?

02:24.979 --> 02:28.280
 Is the crime scene inspiring,
 you know, any
 otherworldly communications

02:28.282 --> 02:29.648
       Or conjurings
       or what have you?

02:29.650 --> 02:31.750
  Wow. You're really a flip
  to the last page of the book

02:31.752 --> 02:33.051
         Type guy, huh?

02:33.053 --> 02:34.520
     You've been detecting
     for five minutes.

02:34.522 --> 02:36.088
     Oh, i know who did it.

02:36.090 --> 02:37.156
         It's the wife.

02:37.158 --> 02:38.657
     You think it was that
     sobbing woman

02:38.659 --> 02:40.325
    Crumbling
    to pieces on the patio?

02:40.327 --> 02:42.728
   She has an alibi,
   but it's always the wife.

02:42.730 --> 02:44.429
        Unless the wife
        is the dead one.

02:44.431 --> 02:45.831
     Then it's the husband.

02:45.833 --> 02:48.100
  I was just hoping something
  sparked your sixth sense,

02:48.102 --> 02:49.368
  So we can expedite things.

02:49.370 --> 02:50.636
      Sorry. No sparking.

02:50.638 --> 02:52.604
           Detective,

02:52.606 --> 02:54.773
 We're going to have to remove
 the paint brush in order
 to get him in the bag, so...

02:54.775 --> 02:56.074
           I got it.

02:56.076 --> 02:57.176
   I'll check back in later.

03:00.347 --> 03:02.281
    This fake psychic thing

03:02.283 --> 03:05.517
 Is going to bite me
 in the ass when he starts
 asking me for lottery numbers.

03:07.454 --> 03:09.888
     Fresh brains, anyone?

03:09.890 --> 03:12.291
       Liv: <i> My need to feed</i>
      <i> on brains is weird,</i>

03:12.293 --> 03:14.993
<i> But how many people can say</i>
<i> that satisfying their munchies</i>

03:14.995 --> 03:18.597
     <i> Could potentially help</i>
     <i> solve a murder case?</i>

03:18.599 --> 03:21.333
    <i> This is my contribution</i>
    <i> to society.</i>

03:24.538 --> 03:25.804
            Better?

03:26.540 --> 03:28.240
             Much.

03:28.242 --> 03:31.743
 <i> I'm just a fake, psychic</i>
 <i> zombie trying to do her part.</i>

03:32.513 --> 03:34.179
        (doorbell rings)

03:36.617 --> 03:38.750
 I was going to rename this
 "major's excuse to come over,"

03:38.752 --> 03:40.919
   But i'm trying to maintain
   an air of mystery.

03:40.921 --> 03:43.055
   No, but seriously,
   i figured after six months

03:43.057 --> 03:45.691
  You were probably
  really missing
  your tiny face-sander thing

03:45.693 --> 03:48.794
    And that magnifying
    mirror that makes pores
    look like manholes.

03:48.796 --> 03:50.462
    Thanks for leaving
    that behind, by the way.

03:50.464 --> 03:51.863
  You didn't need to do this.

03:51.865 --> 03:54.066
  No, it's mostly just
  hair products and lingerie,

03:54.068 --> 03:55.701
    But there's some books.

03:55.703 --> 03:57.936
        Oh, and this...

03:59.940 --> 04:02.741
      Which might
      explain some things.

04:02.743 --> 04:04.843
    I'm thinking maybe this
    calls for a road trip.

04:06.981 --> 04:08.513
   I'm just, i'm just kidding
   around, liv.

04:09.383 --> 04:11.250
            I know.

04:11.252 --> 04:13.919
  Yeah, well, i didn't know
  what to do with this stuff.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.654
 It felt weird to throw it out.

04:15.656 --> 04:18.190
    I mean, what if you had
    an emotional attachment

04:18.192 --> 04:20.524
     To this textbook
     on rare skin diseases?

04:20.527 --> 04:22.227
      Well, thanks
      for bringing it by.

04:22.229 --> 04:26.064
  "not zooey deschanel" in 7b
  took my parking spot again.

04:26.066 --> 04:29.268
   There is nothing more
   annoying than an entitled
   chick in a skater dress.

04:29.270 --> 04:31.470
          Oh, hi. Hey.

04:31.472 --> 04:33.639
     Should i not be here?

04:33.641 --> 04:35.140
    No, i, uh,
    i was just heading out.

04:38.345 --> 04:41.546
     I, uh, i also have
     an entire closet full
     of engagement gifts,

04:41.548 --> 04:43.815
     So just let me know
     if you want anything,

04:43.817 --> 04:48.320
   Other than the panini
   press which i have already
   used and broken,

04:48.322 --> 04:49.755
       And re-purchased.

04:49.757 --> 04:51.123
   Oh, we'll take the juicer.

04:52.326 --> 04:54.359
   I'll, uh, i'll drop it off
   this week.

04:56.163 --> 04:58.263
   Wait, didn't you register
   for a nespresso machine?

04:58.265 --> 05:01.767
    I can't believe
    you just asked major for
    our engagement juicer.

05:01.769 --> 05:03.769
     Like letting him keep
     the small appliances
      is going to change

05:03.771 --> 05:05.037
       The fact that you
       broke his heart.

05:05.039 --> 05:06.738
    He probably
    shouldn't come by here.

05:06.740 --> 05:08.840
  Why? Because it's too hard?

05:08.842 --> 05:10.042
    What does that tell you?

05:23.957 --> 05:25.324
            (gasps)

05:25.326 --> 05:28.327
      Want to grab a bite?

05:28.329 --> 05:31.129
     Liv: <i> What's more meta</i>
     <i> than a zombie having</i>
      <i> a bad zombie dream?</i>

05:32.733 --> 05:36.068
   No luck in my search for
   mystery zombie number two.

05:36.070 --> 05:38.236
      Unless you
      count my nightmares.

05:38.238 --> 05:39.938
    I've searched instagram
    accounts of survivors,

05:39.940 --> 05:42.341
   I've been through all the
   photos on the facebook
   pages of everyone

05:42.343 --> 05:43.875
     Who was listed
     as being at the party.

05:43.877 --> 05:45.544
 Maybe you should take a break.

05:45.546 --> 05:48.714
      You know, chill out.
      Clear your mind.

05:48.716 --> 05:49.881
             Here.

05:54.021 --> 05:56.822
      "hotter sex tonight.
      Five easy steps."

05:56.824 --> 05:58.523
     I stole it from
     the dentist's office.

06:01.628 --> 06:03.628
    Liv: <i> Unless step one is</i>

06:03.630 --> 06:06.298
  <i> "forget that you might turn</i>
  <i> your loved one into a zombie</i>
  <i> and just have at it,"</i>

06:06.300 --> 06:08.367
      <i> This is not</i>
      <i> the article for me.</i>

06:08.369 --> 06:09.601
 <i> It's why i can't have the man</i>

     <i> I planned on spending</i>

        <i> Doing drop-bys.</i>

06:12.639 --> 06:13.972
       <i> It hurts too much.</i>

06:15.676 --> 06:17.776
   (javier speaking spanish)

06:20.647 --> 06:22.247
      (breathing heavily)

06:22.249 --> 06:23.315
            Oh, god.

06:23.317 --> 06:25.217
   (javier speaking spanish)

06:26.253 --> 06:27.319
         (door closing)

06:27.321 --> 06:28.687
            (gasps)

06:28.689 --> 06:29.988
        Someone's here.

06:29.990 --> 06:31.056
           (exhales)

06:32.860 --> 06:34.593
 Is that shock at sex tip four?

06:34.595 --> 06:36.728
     'cause i didn't
     understand it either.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.930
  Javier was having an affair.

06:39.767 --> 06:41.366
       It was pretty hot.

06:42.970 --> 06:44.302
 Clive: So during this vision,

06:44.304 --> 06:47.038
  Did javier happen
  to call out the girl's name?

06:48.175 --> 06:50.409
     No. He just called her
     his sugar flower,

06:50.411 --> 06:51.877
     Or his honey goddess.

06:51.879 --> 06:53.812
 Both sound better in spanish.

06:53.814 --> 06:56.381
  She mostly talked about god.

06:56.383 --> 06:58.450
     And you didn't see
     who walked in on them?

06:58.452 --> 06:59.818
   No, but it was at the loft

06:59.820 --> 07:02.554
 Because i recognized the
 chaise in javier's work space.

07:02.556 --> 07:03.688
    They were on top of it.

07:04.792 --> 07:06.925
   At one point, she suddenly
   arched her back,

07:06.927 --> 07:10.462
     Like some higher power
     was pulling her chest
     towards the heavens.

07:10.464 --> 07:12.664
   Her skin was like butter,

07:12.666 --> 07:14.132
    And the way she moved...

07:14.134 --> 07:15.534
    Okay, i think i get it.

07:15.536 --> 07:17.769
      It was like watching
      a flower bloom.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.538
    Very helpful. Thank you.

07:19.540 --> 07:21.206
       Arching, blooming,

07:21.208 --> 07:23.141
      Then someone came in
      that you didn't see,

07:23.143 --> 07:25.043
     But was probably lola.

07:25.045 --> 07:26.211
       I didn't say that.

07:26.213 --> 07:28.146
     No. You gave me
    <i> fifty shades of psychic</i>

07:28.148 --> 07:29.881
     And no vital details.

07:29.883 --> 07:31.450
 Look, he was having an affair.

07:31.452 --> 07:32.651
      His wife caught him.

07:32.653 --> 07:35.220
    Like i said,
    it's always the spouse.

07:36.557 --> 07:38.757
    I'm going to head over
    and question her again.

07:38.759 --> 07:40.559
   You feel like joining me?

07:40.561 --> 07:42.894
       Maybe you'll have
       another vision.

07:42.896 --> 07:45.931
   Hopefully one that's less
   late-night premium cable.

07:49.336 --> 07:52.571
     She's a bit more
     calm right now, but...

07:52.573 --> 07:54.673
 It's going to be a long road.

07:55.742 --> 07:56.842
             Lola,

07:56.844 --> 07:58.743
  Detective babineaux is here.

08:00.581 --> 08:02.080
     I'm going to take off.

08:02.082 --> 08:03.715
     You call me
     if you need anything.

08:03.717 --> 08:05.283
      That's sugar flower.

08:05.285 --> 08:07.219
        From my vision.

08:07.221 --> 08:08.520
     With the buttery skin.

08:11.391 --> 08:13.692
    Sorry to interrupt you,
    mrs. Abano.

08:13.694 --> 08:15.427
  I had a few more questions.

08:15.429 --> 08:17.762
     Of course.
     And it's lola, please.

08:17.764 --> 08:20.065
     And this is
     my dear friend tasha.

08:20.067 --> 08:23.034
   She's my favorite
   of all of javier's lovers.

08:35.148 --> 08:39.116
 Lola: Artie and i wound up
 eating without javier all the
 time when he was working.

08:39.119 --> 08:41.086
  He'd just get lost painting,

08:41.087 --> 08:43.855
     Or not want to stop
     if it was going well.

08:43.857 --> 08:46.258
     He was at the mercy
     of his creative flow.

08:46.260 --> 08:49.094
  Sounds like you were
  at the mercy of it as well.

08:49.096 --> 08:50.495
        I never minded.

08:50.497 --> 08:54.165
    I just wanted him to
    feel free to do whatever
    he needed to do.

08:54.167 --> 08:56.868
    I respected his process.

08:56.870 --> 09:00.639
        The other women,
        were they a part
         of his process?

09:00.641 --> 09:02.674
           (chuckles)

09:02.676 --> 09:05.810
    Asking javier to sleep
    with one woman
    for the rest of his life

09:05.812 --> 09:07.479
         Would be like

09:07.481 --> 09:10.482
     Asking him to paint
     those little seascapes
     on the novelty spoons

09:10.484 --> 09:12.384
     They sell at the pier.

09:12.386 --> 09:14.920
     He had a way of, like,
     discovering people,

09:14.922 --> 09:18.156
   And then sort of revealing
   them to themselves.

09:18.158 --> 09:20.225
   That is really beautiful.

09:21.295 --> 09:23.228
 Seriously, he sounds amazing.

09:25.432 --> 09:28.199
     Lola: The other women
     were not an issue.

09:28.201 --> 09:30.302
   I knew who javier was with

09:30.304 --> 09:32.470
    And what he was getting
    out of the relationship.

09:32.472 --> 09:34.472
      He knew all
      about my dalliances.

09:34.474 --> 09:36.007
        Nobody got hurt.

09:36.009 --> 09:39.044
    It's not like we had
    children to worry about.

09:39.046 --> 09:40.979
    Javier never wanted any.

09:40.981 --> 09:43.248
 His paintings were his babies.

09:44.818 --> 09:46.685
        Yeah, right. So,

09:46.687 --> 09:49.454
      It didn't bother you
      that his babies

09:49.456 --> 09:51.923
  Were nude paintings of the
  women he was sleeping with?

09:51.925 --> 09:53.291
              No.

09:53.293 --> 09:55.560
  It bothers me
  that you're being dismissive

09:55.562 --> 09:58.096
     About my husband's art
     and our marriage.

09:58.899 --> 10:02.968
        Monogamy was not
        important to us.

10:02.970 --> 10:06.638
    What javier and i had
    was beyond the physical.

10:08.942 --> 10:12.377
    How is it incriminating
    to say she didn't care
      who he slept with?

10:12.379 --> 10:13.445
       Uh, she cared.

10:13.447 --> 10:15.113
      That's just
      something they say.

10:15.115 --> 10:18.049
     Of course, i might've
     been paying closer
     attention than you.

10:18.051 --> 10:20.418
      You seemed
      a little distracted.

10:20.420 --> 10:22.821
 -(cell phone vibrating)
 -plus, it's always the spouse.

10:22.823 --> 10:24.189
              Huh.

10:24.191 --> 10:25.256
             What?

10:25.258 --> 10:26.758
   An e-mail from your boss.

10:26.760 --> 10:27.959
  The paintbrush/murder weapon

10:27.961 --> 10:29.928
     Was thrust into
     mr. Abano's eye socket

10:29.930 --> 10:35.834
   At an angle consistent
   with a right-handed killer
   who was 6'2" or 6'3".

10:35.836 --> 10:38.637
     Does that mean javier
     had two wives?

10:38.639 --> 10:40.038
     Because lola is around
     my height, right?

10:40.040 --> 10:41.906
 So, if it's always the spouse,

10:41.908 --> 10:43.875
  Maybe it was wife number two
  that's the tall one.

10:47.247 --> 10:48.413
             Wait!

10:48.415 --> 10:51.249
 I'm being totally serious now.

10:51.251 --> 10:53.852
     If you find a pair of
     foot-high stilettos
     in lola's closet,

10:53.854 --> 10:55.220
      Can you ask her
      where she got them?

10:58.892 --> 11:01.292
  Liv, you're here. Fantastic.

11:03.263 --> 11:04.996
         This is jimmy.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.598
 He is a police sketch artist.

11:06.600 --> 11:08.867
   I happened to run into him
   at the commissary,

11:08.869 --> 11:10.435
  And we got to talking and...

11:10.437 --> 11:12.437
     Well, i mentioned your
     issue trying to locate

11:12.439 --> 11:14.506
  A certain blonde gentleman.

11:14.508 --> 11:17.909
   I had a pretty substantial
   missed connection
   myself back in '05.

11:17.911 --> 11:19.310
            (sighs)

11:19.312 --> 11:21.112
 I'd be married today if those
 subway doors didn't close

11:21.114 --> 11:22.681
 Before i could get her number.

11:24.251 --> 11:25.483
              Huh.

11:25.485 --> 11:27.886
   Okay.
   So, any defining features?

11:28.922 --> 11:30.488
      His lips were thin,

11:30.490 --> 11:32.991
     But there
     was substance to them.

11:32.993 --> 11:34.793
       They kind of grew
       from his mouth,

11:34.795 --> 11:36.494
       Like a secret
       he couldn't keep.

11:37.364 --> 11:38.697
        So, thin lips...

11:38.699 --> 11:39.764
      Liv: But expressive.

11:41.134 --> 11:42.467
      In that they seemed
      to be working

11:42.469 --> 11:44.669
  At not expressing anything.

11:46.440 --> 11:47.739
            Mmm-hmm.

11:47.741 --> 11:50.842
    There was something
    historic about his chin.

11:53.547 --> 11:55.714
     I think the nose needs
     to be more alert.

11:55.716 --> 11:57.649
    I thought you said
    it was soft and gradual,

11:57.651 --> 11:59.217
       Like a sand hill.

11:59.219 --> 12:00.685
     But with an alertness.

12:00.687 --> 12:02.520
     Like the whole bridge
     is working towards

12:02.522 --> 12:04.923
   Getting down to the point.

12:04.925 --> 12:06.291
      You need to
      see the foundation.

12:06.293 --> 12:07.992
      Oh. The foundation.

12:07.994 --> 12:09.661
 Got it. Great. (clears throat)

12:10.664 --> 12:11.730
             Okay.

12:14.234 --> 12:15.567
         See you later.

12:18.038 --> 12:19.871
     Am i right in assuming
     this is a new skill?

12:23.477 --> 12:28.413
 You said you were with
 lola at the orchard restaurant
 from 6:00 p.M. To 9:30 p.M.,

12:28.415 --> 12:31.116
     When you walked her
     back to the loft
     and discovered javier.

12:31.118 --> 12:32.517
            Mmm-hmm.

12:32.519 --> 12:35.920
 Three and a half hours is
 a pretty long time for dinner.

12:35.922 --> 12:37.655
     Not really. (chuckles)

12:37.657 --> 12:41.359
      We spent a big chunk
      of the time waiting
      for javier to show.

12:41.361 --> 12:43.461
      I'm not just
      javier's art dealer.

12:43.463 --> 12:46.030
    We have all been friends
    for years.

12:46.032 --> 12:48.233
       And how close
       are you and lola?

12:48.235 --> 12:49.634
          Very close.

12:49.636 --> 12:51.336
      She's one of
      my dearest friends.

12:51.671 --> 12:52.737
              Hmm.

12:52.739 --> 12:55.106
    Nothing more than that.
    Not ever.

12:55.108 --> 12:57.642
     She's totally devoted
     to javier.

12:57.644 --> 13:00.311
     Yeah, she did mention
     having

13:00.313 --> 13:02.947
    Dalliances
    outside of the marriage.

13:02.949 --> 13:04.382
          Dalliances?

13:05.418 --> 13:06.484
           With whom?

13:06.486 --> 13:08.119
   She didn't give any names.

13:08.121 --> 13:11.122
   Sorry, i'm having trouble
   processing that.

13:11.124 --> 13:13.558
      Javier was
      her entire universe.

13:13.560 --> 13:15.226
        Lola loved him
        unconditionally,

13:15.228 --> 13:18.596
    While javier slept with
    every model in seattle.

13:18.598 --> 13:21.032
      You don't sound
      like a very big fan
      of your client.

13:21.034 --> 13:22.934
     Oh, i was a huge fan.

13:22.936 --> 13:25.537
   Some of the best times of
   my life were with javier.

13:25.539 --> 13:27.539
   He was a brilliant artist.

13:27.541 --> 13:28.606
      Not a great husband.

13:29.743 --> 13:31.943
  How tall are you, mr. Fiss?

13:31.945 --> 13:34.179
      You know, instead of
      grilling his friend,

13:34.181 --> 13:37.515
    Maybe take a look
    at one of the countless
    jilted boyfriends

13:37.517 --> 13:39.350
      Of the girls javier
      slept with.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.754
      Thanks for the tip.

13:42.756 --> 13:44.389
     Now, are you going to
     answer my question

13:44.391 --> 13:45.723
       Or do i need
       to go get a ruler?

13:45.725 --> 13:46.791
           I'm 6'2".

13:47.227 --> 13:48.626
           Thank you.

13:49.329 --> 13:50.562
     In elementary school,

13:50.564 --> 13:52.897
  I could barely trace my hand
  to draw a turkey.

13:52.899 --> 13:55.500
  Well, when you finish,
  i'll send it out to
  the boat massacre survivors.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.735
  You know, maybe
  someone will recognize him.

14:01.041 --> 14:02.607
      Why do we own this?

14:02.609 --> 14:03.908
     Because we saw it
     in the check-out line

14:03.910 --> 14:05.243
      At home, hearth
      and everything else

14:05.245 --> 14:07.378
 And it had the same color blue
 as our pillows.

14:07.380 --> 14:09.080
         It's horrible.

14:09.082 --> 14:11.282
   Since when did you become
   an art critic?

14:11.284 --> 14:13.785
     The one and only time
     we've ever gone
     to a museum together

14:13.787 --> 14:15.019
       Was on our senior
       trip to paris

14:15.021 --> 14:16.521
      When we race-walked
      through the louvre

14:16.523 --> 14:18.523
     Because it was raining
     and we wanted
     to do some cardio.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.024
        That's so awful.

14:20.026 --> 14:22.327
      No, it wasn't awful.
      It was fun.

14:22.329 --> 14:24.829
     Liv: <i> In the six months</i>
    <i> i've been eating brains,</i>

14:24.831 --> 14:26.431
   <i> I've inherited things like</i>

14:26.433 --> 14:29.200
       <i> A fear of pigeons,</i>
       <i> kleptomania...</i>

14:29.202 --> 14:32.237

14:38.311 --> 14:41.479

     <i> make love to it.</i>

14:41.481 --> 14:44.716
     <i> I walk into a room</i>
     <i> and i see everything.</i>

14:59.099 --> 15:00.798
 Heard you were looking for me.

15:09.376 --> 15:11.442
     Just so we're on
     the same page here...

15:11.444 --> 15:13.845
   Your skin and hair
   being the color of chalk,

15:13.847 --> 15:15.847
     That isn't
     a style choice, right?

15:16.583 --> 15:17.982
           It isn't.

15:17.984 --> 15:19.617
              Oh.

15:19.619 --> 15:23.187
      And i have no idea
      where you got this,

15:24.291 --> 15:26.858
      But it's totally
      my new profile pic.

15:27.527 --> 15:29.260
              So.

15:29.262 --> 15:30.495
   What do you want with me?

15:30.497 --> 15:32.130
     I wanted to meet you.

15:32.132 --> 15:33.298
            Because?

15:33.300 --> 15:35.533
     Because i had a vision
     of you as a zombie,

15:35.535 --> 15:36.935
       Chasing a man
       through an alley.

15:36.937 --> 15:39.304
      You were about to
      rip open his skull.

15:39.306 --> 15:41.372
    He was killed in a dui
    accident, wound up here.

15:41.374 --> 15:42.674
        I ate his brain.

15:42.676 --> 15:44.909
  Until the vision, i thought
  i was the only one.

15:44.911 --> 15:48.680
  Yeah, until, like,
  three seconds ago, so did i.

15:48.682 --> 15:51.549
  Getting your brains on
  the job. That's well-played.

15:51.551 --> 15:53.318
        Well, how do you
        get your brains?

15:53.320 --> 15:56.054
   Oh, i get mine the hardest
   way possible.

15:56.056 --> 15:57.322
          I grave-rob.

15:57.324 --> 15:59.390
           Super fun.

15:59.392 --> 16:02.260
       I should have gone
       into medicine.

16:02.262 --> 16:03.728
        I mean, come on.

16:03.730 --> 16:05.263
         Look at this.

16:05.265 --> 16:06.965
           Oh, uh...

16:06.967 --> 16:09.767
      That guy you saw me
      chase in the vision?

16:09.769 --> 16:11.836
      He tried to mug me,
      just so you know.

16:11.838 --> 16:16.174
 He came at me, so i raged out
 or whatever.

16:16.176 --> 16:18.176
   What are you calling that,
   by the way?

16:18.178 --> 16:19.544
         The big turn?

16:19.546 --> 16:21.679
 It's not like i've been
 mentioning it in conversation,

16:21.681 --> 16:23.781
       But i think of it
       as raging out.

16:23.783 --> 16:25.984
    I don't know if
    we should agree on
    some terminology, or...

16:25.986 --> 16:27.618
       I guess i call it
       zombie mode.

16:27.620 --> 16:30.221
   Really? Aren't we already
   kind of in zombie mode?

16:30.223 --> 16:33.324
   Well, actually, i call it
   full-on zombie mode.

16:33.326 --> 16:34.625
              Huh.

16:34.627 --> 16:37.495
   So, is raging out at all
   interesting to you, or...

16:39.866 --> 16:42.867
   You know what, never mind.
   It doesn't matter.

16:42.869 --> 16:48.673
  Uh, the guy tried to mug me,
  and i went into
  full-on zombie mode

16:48.675 --> 16:49.941
          And, yeah...

16:49.943 --> 16:51.976
      Before i knew it,
      sirens were blaring

16:51.978 --> 16:55.113
 And i'm still about to crack
 this guy's head open for just
  the tiniest taste of brain,

16:55.115 --> 16:58.649
     Which is the single
     most disgusting thing
     a person can eat.

16:58.651 --> 16:59.717
          That it is.

16:59.719 --> 17:01.319
      It's the consistency
      that kills me.

17:01.321 --> 17:04.188
     I can't get around it.
     And there's that
     weird metallic taste.

17:04.190 --> 17:06.590
       Is it metallic?
       I don't even know.

17:06.593 --> 17:09.093
      I used to be
      a serious wine guy.

17:09.095 --> 17:10.560
Like, <i> sideways</i> crazy about it.

17:10.563 --> 17:12.896
    And now everything
    i drink is like iodine.

17:12.898 --> 17:14.832
 I saw a kid eating
 a peanut butter cup last week

17:14.834 --> 17:16.834
      And i almost cried.

17:16.836 --> 17:18.770
      I miss food so much.

17:18.771 --> 17:21.439
     I miss so many things.

17:21.441 --> 17:23.808
    Who knew death would be
    this isolating, right?

17:27.714 --> 17:29.614
       You really nailed
       the historic chin.

17:29.616 --> 17:30.748
             Bravo.

17:30.750 --> 17:31.816
   Thrilled to have you here.

17:31.818 --> 17:33.217
    And if you haven't
    used the facilities yet,

17:33.219 --> 17:34.685
        A urine sample
        would be lovely.

17:37.323 --> 17:40.391
   I have zero clue as to how
   this happened to me.

17:40.393 --> 17:42.927
  Granted i was super high
  the night of the boat party.

17:44.197 --> 17:46.497
      It is so crazy to be
      talking about this.

17:46.499 --> 17:48.299
   Would you mind if i check
   inside your ears?

17:48.301 --> 17:50.735
     Brother, you do
     what you gotta to do.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.804
  I'll drop trou if you think
  you can cure this.

17:54.641 --> 17:56.941
        So how did you
        become a zombie?

18:01.081 --> 18:03.614
    Did it happen the night
    of the boat party?

18:03.616 --> 18:05.750
       Yes. It happened
       at the boat party.

18:05.752 --> 18:08.453
 You tried to sell me utopium,
 smacked my ass,

18:08.455 --> 18:11.122
    And went all rage zombie
    and clawed my forearm.

18:11.124 --> 18:12.790
         No, seriously?

18:14.794 --> 18:16.094
          Oh, my god.

18:16.096 --> 18:17.295
        I can't even...

18:17.297 --> 18:19.197
    -Are you sure it was me?
    -Yes.

18:19.199 --> 18:21.699
 Because things must've
 been pretty crazy that night.

18:21.701 --> 18:23.134
           I'm sure.

18:23.136 --> 18:26.070
    How do i even apologize
    for something like that?

18:26.072 --> 18:30.374
  I swear to god, if i wasn't
  95% sure i would survive,

18:30.376 --> 18:32.743
    I would throw myself
    off a bridge right now.

18:32.745 --> 18:33.811
         I would be...

18:36.583 --> 18:37.982
         I'm so sorry.

18:37.984 --> 18:39.450
   I never meant to hurt you.

18:40.954 --> 18:42.420
    Javier: Calm down, now.

18:42.422 --> 18:44.355
     We're all adults here.

18:44.357 --> 18:46.357
      Now i've ruined
      something you love.

18:48.128 --> 18:49.894
        Did you just...

18:49.896 --> 18:51.395
        Where'd you go?

18:51.397 --> 18:52.997
     There's something
     i gotta take care of.

18:52.999 --> 18:54.065
     You should get going.

18:54.067 --> 18:55.366
   Oh, liv, i can finish up.

18:56.903 --> 18:57.969
              Ah!

18:59.706 --> 19:01.772
    She doesn't want to
    leave you alone with me.

19:03.710 --> 19:04.809
          Fair enough.

19:04.811 --> 19:06.110
        (clears throat)

19:09.082 --> 19:10.148
           Excuse me.

19:16.556 --> 19:18.756
      I'm not sure
      that was necessary.

19:18.758 --> 19:20.291
         Neither am i.

19:22.862 --> 19:25.429
    It wasn't lola who
    caught javier and tasha
    fooling around.

19:25.431 --> 19:27.932
       It was tasha's
       jealous boyfriend.

19:27.934 --> 19:30.334
   A jealous boyfriend, huh?

19:30.336 --> 19:33.437
  Artie may have been
  trying to deflect attention
  away from himself,

19:33.439 --> 19:35.106
      But it's a lead
      worth following up.

19:35.108 --> 19:37.942
 Liv: There he is. Tasha's ex.

19:37.944 --> 19:39.777
     The one with the
     gleaming crystal eyes

19:39.779 --> 19:43.014
    And the mouth that
    looks like it just
    finished eating a peach.

19:43.016 --> 19:45.216
      How about you just
      tell me what color
      shirt he's wearing?

19:48.288 --> 19:49.921
           Cerulean.

19:49.922 --> 19:51.555
    What were you doing
    on tuesday between the
    hours of 6:00 and 7:00?

19:51.558 --> 19:53.424
     I was at home. Alone.

19:53.426 --> 19:54.725
      How did that happen?

19:58.264 --> 20:00.298
 How tall are you, mr. Rivera?

20:00.300 --> 20:01.365
           I'm 6'3".

20:02.335 --> 20:03.401
       When did you first
       learn about...

20:03.403 --> 20:04.869
   Can i just ask a question?

20:04.871 --> 20:07.171
      Do you have a little
      native american
      in your ancestry

20:07.173 --> 20:08.306
   'cause those cheekbones...

20:08.308 --> 20:09.807
          Miss moore!

20:09.809 --> 20:11.609
           Oh. Sorry.

20:13.146 --> 20:14.879
    I'm a quarter cherokee.

20:14.881 --> 20:16.347
         Yeah, you are.

20:16.349 --> 20:18.149
 Do i need to ask you to leave?

20:22.155 --> 20:25.256
     When did you first
     learn about your
     girlfriend and javier?

20:25.258 --> 20:26.490
         Ex-girlfriend.

20:26.492 --> 20:28.125
     And i don't remember.

20:28.127 --> 20:30.695
  You don't remember
  discovering your girlfriend
  cheating on you?

20:30.697 --> 20:32.630
      I don't like
      to dwell on things.

20:32.632 --> 20:34.699
    Besides, she got
    what was coming to her.

20:34.701 --> 20:38.936
     Javier dumped her
     a few months ago
     for a younger version.

20:38.938 --> 20:40.972
     That's the kind of guy
     she left me for.

20:40.974 --> 20:43.474
     Someone who'll bang
     his best friend's
     18-year-old daughter.

20:43.977 --> 20:45.443
             Artie?

20:45.445 --> 20:46.777
    His manager's daughter?

20:46.779 --> 20:48.713
          Yeah. Becca.

20:48.715 --> 20:51.415
    It's a not-too-well-kept
    secret around
    the art community.

20:51.417 --> 20:52.717
        But you didn't
        hear it from me.

21:13.873 --> 21:16.307
        You gotta let me
        buy you a drink.

21:16.309 --> 21:18.909
    I need something
    in the win column today.

21:18.911 --> 21:21.178
  I think you need to set
  the bar a little bit higher.

21:21.180 --> 21:24.548
    Buying somebody a drink
    doesn't seem like much
     of an accomplishment.

21:24.550 --> 21:28.386
    That depends on how many
    guys you turned down
    before i got here.

21:31.858 --> 21:33.658
     So... (clears throat)

21:33.660 --> 21:35.393
      What brings you
      here to drink alone

21:35.395 --> 21:38.896
     And stare off into
     the top-shelf liquor
     on this fine evening?

21:38.898 --> 21:42.066
   Let's just say life takes
   some surprising turns.

21:42.769 --> 21:44.435
      Doesn't it, though?

21:44.437 --> 21:46.637
     If someone were
     to tell me a year ago

21:46.639 --> 21:48.472
      That my life would
      be like it is today,

21:48.474 --> 21:49.740
       I would've punched
       him in the face.

21:54.847 --> 21:56.914
            Listen,

21:56.916 --> 21:59.383
  You're incredibly charming,

21:59.385 --> 22:02.219
   But the age difference
   isn't something i'm into.

22:02.221 --> 22:03.721
        (clears throat)

22:03.723 --> 22:05.189
     Well, that is a shame.

22:05.191 --> 22:07.858
  Because i am lonely as hell
  and the idea of trying

22:07.860 --> 22:09.527
     To have a conversation
     with some 25-year-old

22:09.529 --> 22:11.028
        As she swipes
        through tinder,

22:11.030 --> 22:13.597
    Makes me want to impale
    myself on that bar tap.

22:14.967 --> 22:17.435
 Well, there's no reason
 why we can't have a nice chat.

22:18.971 --> 22:20.237
         Sure there is.

22:49.435 --> 22:50.801
       (knocking on door)

22:50.803 --> 22:52.169
          Come on in.

22:52.171 --> 22:54.338
 (jazz music playing on stereo)

22:59.379 --> 23:00.544
             Um...

23:03.182 --> 23:05.816
     Hey, pod person who's
     taken over liv's body,

23:05.818 --> 23:07.418
      You really should've
      done some homework

23:07.420 --> 23:09.153
     Because no one
     is going to buy this.

23:09.155 --> 23:10.488
              Hey.

23:10.490 --> 23:12.156
   Sorry. I was kind of
   in the zone or something.

23:12.158 --> 23:13.224
              Hi.

23:13.226 --> 23:15.025
              Hi.

23:15.027 --> 23:17.261
 I would literally be
 less surprised to come in here

23:17.263 --> 23:18.629
     And find you building
     a rocket ship.

23:18.631 --> 23:20.164
       It's a new hobby.

23:20.166 --> 23:22.500
     This coming
     from the girl who said

23:22.502 --> 23:25.736
    Hobbies were for people
    under 12 or over 65.

23:25.738 --> 23:27.271
      When did i say that?

23:27.273 --> 23:30.274
  Repeatedly. Over the course
  of several years.

23:30.276 --> 23:31.776
   But i think you were just
   trying to talk me out of

23:31.778 --> 23:33.511
       Making my own
       outdoor furniture,

23:33.513 --> 23:36.614
   Which i still think
   i'd be kind of awesome at.

23:36.616 --> 23:38.682
    And, i'm sorry, are you
    listening to chet baker?

23:38.684 --> 23:41.585
      Is that who this is?
      I am loving him.

23:41.587 --> 23:42.820
          You're what?

23:42.822 --> 23:45.222
  I tried to get you to listen
  to jazz for years.

23:45.224 --> 23:48.726
  I spent weeks
  strategically arranging the
  perfect mix cd for you

23:48.728 --> 23:50.327
   And you stopped listening
   after two songs.

23:50.329 --> 23:51.796
    I think this is the cd.

23:51.798 --> 23:53.764
 You said you thought the lack
 of structure was narcissistic

23:53.766 --> 23:55.766
  And you'd rather listen
  to someone dropping cutlery.

23:55.768 --> 23:57.201
     Why was i such a jerk?

23:57.904 --> 23:59.170
       Who knows? (sighs)

23:59.172 --> 24:00.738
  It was just one of the many
  things i accepted

24:00.740 --> 24:02.773
   Because you're super-hot.

24:02.775 --> 24:03.874
          I'm kidding,

24:03.876 --> 24:05.142
          To a degree.

24:07.547 --> 24:08.879
        If you're really
        liking this cd,

24:08.881 --> 24:11.649
    I have a bunch
    of stuff on vinyl
    i could record for you.

24:11.651 --> 24:13.184
         I'd love that.

24:13.186 --> 24:14.285
        You're amazing.

24:18.925 --> 24:20.090
      I should get going.

24:20.092 --> 24:22.593
      I was just dropping
      off the juicer.

24:30.169 --> 24:33.170
      There but for the
      grace of god, right?

24:33.172 --> 24:35.406
   Missed you at the
   zombie social last night.

24:35.408 --> 24:38.209
     We were all there
     cracking wise,
     singing some karaoke.

24:38.211 --> 24:40.945
         And i went with
        <i> tears of a clown</i>

24:40.947 --> 24:44.248
     Because that's kind of
     where i am right now.

24:44.250 --> 24:45.649
    Where's the good doctor?

24:46.252 --> 24:47.952
      He's out on a call.

24:47.954 --> 24:49.320
   I wasn't going to eat him.

24:49.322 --> 24:52.122
    You understand
    why i'm not ready to
    kiss and make up, right?

24:52.124 --> 24:53.324
        Yeah. I get it.

24:53.326 --> 24:55.025
  I turned you into a zombie,

24:55.027 --> 24:56.460
 You saw me almost kill a guy.

24:56.462 --> 24:58.963
 I'm not the same person i was
 the night of the boat party.

24:58.965 --> 25:01.665
 At least i'm trying not to be.

25:01.667 --> 25:04.969
 It's not like i'm ladling out
 soup or saving puppies,

25:04.971 --> 25:08.105
    But i'm actively trying
    not to be a sleazebag.

25:08.107 --> 25:10.107
   Because i was a sleazebag.

25:10.109 --> 25:11.275
    I'm not dealing anymore,

25:11.277 --> 25:13.010
     Much to the chagrin
     of my former employer.

25:13.012 --> 25:15.846
      And i've cut all the
      poisonous people
      out of my life,

25:15.848 --> 25:20.217
  Who were apparently the only
  kind of people in my life,

25:20.219 --> 25:21.352
      So it's just me now.

25:21.354 --> 25:22.786
  Why are you telling me this?

25:22.788 --> 25:24.989
     Who the hell else
     am i gonna tell it to?

25:25.825 --> 25:28.192
    Plus, i need your help.

25:28.194 --> 25:31.195
   Look, i get that you work
   here at the brain automat,

25:31.197 --> 25:33.864
    But for the rest of us,
    meaning me,

25:33.866 --> 25:37.101
  Procuring brains is kind of
  a massive undertaking. So...

25:37.103 --> 25:38.636
       I was hoping,
       from time to time,

25:38.638 --> 25:42.206
   You might be so inclined
   as to help a brother out.

25:46.979 --> 25:48.045
             Okay.

25:48.514 --> 25:49.780
            (sighs)

25:50.383 --> 25:51.515
             Jeez.

25:51.517 --> 25:53.317
  That pause was like a year.

25:53.319 --> 25:57.154
 I can't just hand brains over
 in the police morgue.

25:57.156 --> 25:58.923
      I'll have to meet up
      with you later.

25:58.925 --> 26:01.959
  Of course. I hang out
  at the dog-friendly
  internet cafe on queen anne,

26:01.961 --> 26:03.727
       Mutt bowl surfers.

26:03.729 --> 26:07.331
  I'll be there all afternoon
  just writing my screenplay

26:07.333 --> 26:09.333
  Live-tweeting its progress.

26:09.335 --> 26:11.268
           All right.

26:11.270 --> 26:12.336
      I'll come by later.

26:13.806 --> 26:15.205
           Thank you.

26:26.285 --> 26:27.952
       (honking <i> la cucaracha</i> )

26:32.258 --> 26:33.324
             Hutch!

26:33.326 --> 26:35.025
            Dougie!

26:35.027 --> 26:37.127
    What brings you to this
    fair part of the city?

26:37.730 --> 26:39.663
    Boss is looking for you.

26:39.665 --> 26:41.332
 He wonders where you've been.

26:41.334 --> 26:42.866
     Why don't you tell him
     i'll come by the club
     tomorrow night, huh?

26:43.703 --> 26:44.768
            (groans)

26:45.972 --> 26:48.038
    He wants to see you now.

26:48.040 --> 26:50.341
        Yeah, now's not
        so good for me.

26:50.343 --> 26:52.610
  Are you really going to make
  hutch get out of the car?

26:55.681 --> 26:56.814
     All right. All right.

26:56.816 --> 26:58.082
   Let's calm down, shall we?

26:58.084 --> 27:00.217
   Quit stalling. I want
   your ass in the car, now!

27:00.219 --> 27:03.721
   Well, it seems that
   our wants are
   at odds right now, dougie.

27:03.723 --> 27:06.724
   You see, i want to attend
   to my business right now

27:06.726 --> 27:09.159
 And i want to not go with you
 to a second location.

27:09.161 --> 27:10.828
    And i have to be honest
    with you,

27:10.830 --> 27:12.563
   I'm feeling
   a little threatened here,

27:12.565 --> 27:14.898
 And i find that disconcerting

27:14.900 --> 27:17.101
        'cause i thought
        we were homies.

27:17.103 --> 27:18.235
             Hutch?

27:18.237 --> 27:19.970
 You gonna
 help me out here, brah, or...

27:19.972 --> 27:21.305
              No?

27:21.307 --> 27:22.973
   Okay, i'll tell you what.

27:22.975 --> 27:26.543
    Why don't you
    meet me here tomorrow...

27:35.321 --> 27:36.720
         "i've changed.

27:36.722 --> 27:39.390
  "i've cut all the poisonous
  people out of my life."

27:42.461 --> 27:46.196
   You can either get in on
   your own or hutch can wad
   you up into a little ball

27:46.198 --> 27:47.531
       And throw you in.

27:59.512 --> 28:01.879
      Crazy what happened
      on the lake.

28:01.881 --> 28:04.715
 The way you disappeared,
 everyone thought you was dead.

28:04.717 --> 28:06.950
 Well... They were half right.

28:08.754 --> 28:12.623
     Boss thinks that batch
     must've been cut
     with something lethal.

28:12.625 --> 28:14.758
     He thinks you might've
     been the one
     who did the cutting.

28:14.760 --> 28:15.926
            Come on.

28:15.928 --> 28:17.961
       Is thinking really
       his strong suit?

28:17.963 --> 28:19.463
        But don't worry,

28:19.465 --> 28:23.200
 When i'm running this city,
 i won't make the same mistake.

28:23.202 --> 28:25.436
           (laughing)

28:25.438 --> 28:28.072
     Yeah, and what mistake
     is that?

28:28.074 --> 28:30.374
        Underestimating
        the little guy.

28:34.814 --> 28:36.246
          (screaming)

28:38.417 --> 28:40.284
     (screaming continues)

28:47.526 --> 28:49.126
     You changed your hair.

28:49.595 --> 28:50.728
        That was a joke.

28:50.730 --> 28:51.795
         Can i come in?

28:53.332 --> 28:55.299
 Would you look at this place?

28:55.301 --> 28:56.867
     You've done very well.

28:56.869 --> 28:59.103
   Who knew there was so much
   money in trend-spotting?

28:59.105 --> 29:01.105
     You must be very good.

29:03.676 --> 29:04.875
    What's happening to me?

29:04.877 --> 29:06.243
        Oh, yeah, that.

29:06.245 --> 29:08.312
   Sorry. I buried the lead.

29:08.314 --> 29:09.880
      You're a zombie now.

29:09.882 --> 29:11.315
        Like, for real.

29:11.317 --> 29:14.585
     I know. Shock.
     Disbelief. Confusion.

29:14.587 --> 29:16.220
       Welcome to team z.

29:16.222 --> 29:19.189
 Oh, you're the trend-spotter,
 i should ask you.

29:19.191 --> 29:20.424
           Zombies...

29:20.426 --> 29:22.359
     I heard we're <i> finito.</i>
     Is that, is that true?

29:22.361 --> 29:23.927
 Has over-saturation buried us?

29:23.929 --> 29:26.130
     I don't know.
     I think we're gonna
     surprise some people.

29:26.132 --> 29:28.265
    I mean,
    what did ll cool j say?

29:28.267 --> 29:29.666
  "don't call it a comeback,"
  right?

29:29.668 --> 29:31.368
            (laughs)

29:31.370 --> 29:33.203
      But before you get
      to despair, jackie,

29:33.205 --> 29:34.772
  Allow me to ease your mind.
  (clears throat)

29:34.774 --> 29:36.974
    For a mere 25k a month,

29:36.976 --> 29:41.245
    I've got the brains
    you need to keep
    all your pistons firing.

29:41.247 --> 29:42.946
      Sure, you'll need
      frequent spray tans

29:42.948 --> 29:45.916
   And a considerably
   better colorist to do
   something with that hair,

29:45.918 --> 29:47.751
      But other than that,

29:48.788 --> 29:50.554
        (clears throat)

29:50.556 --> 29:52.523
    Death's gonna be swell.

29:57.263 --> 29:59.630
     Did i mention this
     batch is super fresh?

30:00.533 --> 30:02.065
             Uh-uh.

30:02.067 --> 30:03.567
   First rule of brain club,

30:03.569 --> 30:05.836
       You don't talk
       about brain club.

30:05.838 --> 30:08.472
     There are some things
     worse than death.

30:10.743 --> 30:11.909
             Tina?

30:13.646 --> 30:15.179
  Will you bring my checkbook?

30:19.318 --> 30:21.351
           (sniffing)

30:21.353 --> 30:23.420
      So, i was wondering

30:23.422 --> 30:26.690
  If you happened
  to exchange numbers
  with our new zombie friend.

30:26.692 --> 30:29.526
  I wanted to see if he
  can come in for more tests.

30:29.528 --> 30:30.828
      I don't think
      that's a good idea.

30:30.830 --> 30:32.729
    Under your supervision,
    of course.

30:32.731 --> 30:36.300
 And know that i do appreciate
 you being protective of me.

30:36.302 --> 30:37.668
      I think he's a liar.

30:37.670 --> 30:40.404
    And a phony.
    And i think he's just
    using me for my brains.

30:41.273 --> 30:43.607
      Well, their brains.

30:43.609 --> 30:45.008
    But if he's
    the only other one, i...

30:45.010 --> 30:46.710
    I don't know, ravi.
    I don't know what to do.

30:46.712 --> 30:48.412
    I don't trust him.
    I think he's dangerous.

30:48.414 --> 30:49.580
              Clive: Hey.

30:49.582 --> 30:51.315
    I was wondering
    if you're free tonight?

30:51.317 --> 30:54.451
 There's a posthumous art show
 for javier's work at his loft.

30:54.453 --> 30:56.887
 I was hoping you could join me
 and see if you get anything.

30:56.889 --> 30:58.255
           Of course.

30:58.257 --> 31:00.490
 I got some very helpful
 information from the waitress

31:00.492 --> 31:02.926
  Who waited on artie and lola
  the night of the murder.

31:02.928 --> 31:06.430
  She said artie left the
  restaurant to go to an atm.

31:06.432 --> 31:10.200
 Artie attempted to withdraw
 just down the street
 from javier's and lola's loft.

31:10.202 --> 31:11.869
      It was at 6:45 p.M.,

31:11.871 --> 31:15.172
  Which puts him
  in close proximity to javier

31:15.174 --> 31:18.876
 And without an alibi
 during the window you gave me
 for the time of the murder.

31:18.878 --> 31:20.577
 What do you mean, "attempted"?

31:20.579 --> 31:24.448
  Oh, he wasn't able
  to take out any cash
  because he doesn't have any.

31:24.450 --> 31:26.316
      It goes beyond
      insufficient funds.

31:26.318 --> 31:27.784
       The man is broke.

31:27.786 --> 31:29.853
    He's basically
    living off credit cards.

31:29.855 --> 31:31.622
 Why would lola cover for him?

31:31.624 --> 31:34.258
  I plan on asking her
  that very question tonight.

31:34.260 --> 31:35.893
        This art show...

31:35.895 --> 31:37.227
       I should probably
       come as well.

31:37.229 --> 31:40.530
 In case you need help
 with the art and the open bar.

31:41.567 --> 31:42.699
    And possibly the models.

31:50.910 --> 31:51.975
             Yeah.

31:52.578 --> 31:54.011
      (indistinct chatter)

31:54.813 --> 31:56.113
     You can have it, doc.

31:57.583 --> 31:59.316
      Don't mind if i do.

32:09.795 --> 32:12.329
   Woman: I absolutely loved
   the first painting,

32:12.331 --> 32:13.630
      But who has
      that kind of money?

32:13.632 --> 32:14.998
    The instant javier died

32:15.000 --> 32:16.633
    The price of his
    paintings started
    going through the roof.

32:16.635 --> 32:19.436
  Even his older work
  is almost triple the price.

32:19.438 --> 32:23.373
  The best thing an artist can
  do for their career is die.

32:23.375 --> 32:27.978
  Dying is also the best thing
  an artist can do for
  his broke-ass art dealer.

32:27.980 --> 32:29.846
       I'm going to look
       for our hostess.

32:29.848 --> 32:31.148
      Let me know
      if you get anything.

32:35.154 --> 32:37.020
     So, what is it
     that you actually do?

32:37.022 --> 32:38.555
 Do you just stand there, or...

32:38.557 --> 32:40.757
      Oh, should i find
      some personal items
      for you to touch?

32:40.759 --> 32:44.261
  I kind of just walk around
  and hope something happens.

32:44.263 --> 32:46.096
  It sounds kind of lame
  now that i say it out loud.

32:46.098 --> 32:47.497
    No, it doesn't. Mmm-mmm.

32:47.499 --> 32:48.899
     No. You're on a quest

32:48.901 --> 32:51.601
  For visions.
  A vision quest, if you will.

32:51.603 --> 32:53.937
    Stop enjoying yourself.
    It's unseemly.

33:08.253 --> 33:11.188
 Detective babineaux.
 I didn't know you'd be coming.

33:11.190 --> 33:13.824
     Well, i had
     a follow-up question.

33:13.826 --> 33:15.692
         I'm wondering

33:15.694 --> 33:18.829
  Why you never mentioned
  that artie left you at the
  restaurant to go to the atm.

33:20.099 --> 33:22.065
       I guess i forgot.

33:22.067 --> 33:23.667
    How long was artie gone?

33:23.669 --> 33:25.402
       I don't remember.

33:25.404 --> 33:27.671
   Not long. Twenty minutes?

33:28.307 --> 33:30.173
        Twenty minutes?

33:30.175 --> 33:34.478
  And how long
  of a walk is it from
  the restaurant to your loft?

33:34.480 --> 33:35.545
          About five?

33:40.719 --> 33:42.586
   You're a detective, right?

33:42.588 --> 33:43.887
           I'm sorry?

33:43.889 --> 33:46.189
  I saw you come in with those
  other two detectives.

33:46.191 --> 33:47.424
       Well, technically,

33:47.426 --> 33:48.825
  I do work for the
  seattle police department...

33:48.827 --> 33:51.561
  My ex-boyfriend is here
  and he's not supposed to be.

33:52.331 --> 33:53.430
             Okay.

33:53.432 --> 33:54.898
  I have a restraining order.

33:54.900 --> 33:57.601
    He's not allowed within
    50 yards of me ever.

33:57.603 --> 33:58.702
      I'd leave, but i...

33:58.704 --> 34:00.904
      No, no, no,
      you shouldn't leave.

34:00.906 --> 34:03.473
 No, you should stay right here

34:03.475 --> 34:05.442
 And we'll get this sorted out.

34:05.444 --> 34:07.644
   Can you, uh, point him out
   for me?

34:15.987 --> 34:18.355
       Liv: <i> Javier not only</i>
      <i> left his art behind,</i>

34:18.357 --> 34:20.556
   <i> He left a part of himself.</i>

34:20.559 --> 34:22.859
   <i> If i'd never come back</i>
   <i> from the lake that night,</i>

34:22.860 --> 34:25.062
<i> What would my loved ones have?</i>

34:25.063 --> 34:27.197
       <i> Would my mom frame</i>
       <i> old report cards?</i>

34:27.199 --> 34:29.266
     <i> -Marvel over</i>
     <i> extra-credit projects?</i>
     -(door closes)

34:32.771 --> 34:34.237
       I thought i saw
       you sneak in here.

34:35.206 --> 34:38.641
  I don't know if it's ironic

34:38.643 --> 34:40.911
       Or just brilliant,

34:40.913 --> 34:42.879
 But javier would've loved you.

34:44.949 --> 34:47.684
 And now he'll never get to lay
 a hand on you, will he?

34:54.592 --> 34:56.493
  I've been thinking about you

34:56.495 --> 35:00.263
 Ever since our interrogation.

35:00.265 --> 35:02.399
   I've heard of
   bad-cop, good-cop before,

35:02.401 --> 35:06.336
     But bad-cop, horny-cop
     was a first.

35:06.338 --> 35:08.505
  How about we go
  grab a drink with the others

35:08.507 --> 35:11.041
  And you can tell me all
  about how i objectified you?

35:11.043 --> 35:15.245
    I think i'd rather
    have you all to myself.

35:24.990 --> 35:27.157
       Javier: Oh, becca.
       My darling girl.

35:27.159 --> 35:30.093
      A boy, javier.
      We're having a son.

35:32.431 --> 35:34.898
   Tito, i should
   explain something to you.

35:34.900 --> 35:37.701
 I'm not the kind of girl
 you want to mess around with.

35:37.703 --> 35:40.003
     I want to mess around
     with you.

35:41.206 --> 35:42.272
            (grunts)

35:46.812 --> 35:47.878
           (groaning)

35:50.916 --> 35:52.015
        It's a good one.

35:52.017 --> 35:53.350
           Mr. Fiss.

35:54.486 --> 35:55.785
        Congratulations.

35:55.787 --> 35:57.120
           Excuse me?

35:57.122 --> 35:58.822
   Well, looks like
   you're having a big night.

35:58.824 --> 36:02.225
    Javier's paintings
    selling for three times
    their previous value.

36:02.227 --> 36:03.493
        What's your cut?

36:03.495 --> 36:05.595
     And here i thought
     you were an art lover.

36:05.597 --> 36:06.663
       I'm disappointed.

36:06.665 --> 36:08.532
  Oh, no, no, no. I love art.

36:08.534 --> 36:12.636
   On a policeman's salary,
      it is kind of tough
   to keep up my collection.

36:12.638 --> 36:14.404
        But i do have
        that one vermer.

36:14.406 --> 36:16.039
         Mmm. Vermeer.

36:16.041 --> 36:19.910
     Excuse me, detective.
     I'm gonna go
     somewhere you're not.

36:19.912 --> 36:24.681
 The extra cash
 has gotta help pay off
 some of those debts of yours.

36:24.683 --> 36:29.085
    And maybe now you
    can get 20 bucks from
    an atm when you need it.

36:29.087 --> 36:32.355
   You seem to be suggesting
   i killed javier for money.

36:32.357 --> 36:34.291
  He was my friend, detective.

36:34.293 --> 36:35.659
        You were in love
        with his wife.

36:39.064 --> 36:40.764
        I believe lola
        deserved better.

36:40.766 --> 36:43.900
     Maybe you killed him
     because he knocked up
     your teenage daughter.

36:45.137 --> 36:46.203
       What did you say?

36:46.205 --> 36:48.638
       Javier was like
       an uncle to becca.

36:48.640 --> 36:50.240
  Yeah, there was love there,
  but it wasn't...

36:50.242 --> 36:52.375
    Oh, come on.
    You expect us to
    believe you didn't know?

36:52.377 --> 36:55.145
  Did javier seem
  like the uncle type to you?

36:55.147 --> 36:58.348
  You found out that
  your best friend was
  going to be your son-in-law,

36:58.350 --> 37:00.984
  And it was a bridge too far.

37:00.986 --> 37:02.118
          You snapped.

37:02.120 --> 37:03.186
          Ravi: Stop!

37:03.188 --> 37:05.322
      Hold that position!

37:05.324 --> 37:09.626
 The angle of the brush,
 it had to be swung from above
 javier by someone taller,

37:09.628 --> 37:13.296
     But if javier was
     on the bottom step...

37:14.099 --> 37:15.165
         (ravi grunts)

37:16.802 --> 37:18.101
           (exclaims)

37:18.103 --> 37:20.203
     He stumbles backwards
     four or five paces

37:20.205 --> 37:22.706
     And the blood splatter
     hits these steps.

37:22.708 --> 37:25.609
      The killer could've
      been liv's size.

37:29.748 --> 37:32.215
     Are you sure
     about this pregnancy?

37:33.819 --> 37:37.320
 Lola, you told me
 javier never wanted children.

37:37.322 --> 37:40.223
    You never mentioned
    whether or not you did.

37:41.827 --> 37:44.427
 You weren't covering for your
 friend artie, were you?

37:44.429 --> 37:46.863
  Artie was covering for you.

37:46.865 --> 37:49.532
 The waitress
 at the restaurant wasn't sure
 what time you arrived,

37:49.534 --> 37:52.702
      Only that artie left
      to go to an atm.

37:52.704 --> 37:55.905
   You killed javier
   before you even got there.

37:55.907 --> 37:57.540
     You found out he was
     going to have the baby

37:57.542 --> 37:59.843
     And start the family
     he never had with you.

38:00.579 --> 38:02.245
  Artie: You knew about this?

38:02.247 --> 38:03.513
    And you didn't tell me?

38:03.515 --> 38:04.648
   Clive: And 20 minutes ago,

38:04.650 --> 38:06.650
    Lola confided in me that
    you left the restaurant

38:06.652 --> 38:07.884
     Long enough
     to commit the murder.

38:07.886 --> 38:09.219
           Detective.

38:09.221 --> 38:11.621
      -I did not...
      -Artie: Lola! Stop!

38:11.623 --> 38:14.457
 When i got back from the atm,
 there you were,

38:14.459 --> 38:16.760
       30 minutes late
       and practically
       hyperventilating.

38:16.762 --> 38:18.428
           Remember?

38:18.430 --> 38:19.763
  I reached up with my napkin

38:19.765 --> 38:23.400
 To wipe what i thought
 was red paint from your cheek.

38:23.402 --> 38:25.735
   When we found javier dead,
   i knew it was you.

38:27.205 --> 38:30.106
     And you somehow knew
     i would cover for you.

38:31.376 --> 38:32.876
          You used me.

38:34.680 --> 38:37.714
       He was leaving me
       to start a family

38:37.716 --> 38:39.816
   With an 18-year-old girl.

38:42.521 --> 38:44.621
       Clive: Lola abano,

38:44.623 --> 38:47.757
       You have the right
       to remain silent.

38:47.759 --> 38:50.727
 Anything you say can and will
 be used against you
 in a court of law.

38:53.799 --> 38:56.533
    You little albino tease!
    Look what you did to me!

38:56.535 --> 38:58.401
         -(thud)
         -(crowd gasps)

39:00.806 --> 39:02.339
     There's a second pair
     of cuffs in my car.

39:02.341 --> 39:03.406
 You mind grabbing them for me?

39:05.210 --> 39:07.610
    I guess you were right.

39:11.883 --> 39:13.583
     It's always the wife.

39:13.584 --> 39:15.284
   Liv: <i> Javier's brain</i>
   <i> shows me a view of</i>
   <i> the world that's brighter,</i>

39:15.287 --> 39:17.654
         <i> More vibrant.</i>

39:17.656 --> 39:20.490
      <i> I can't let lola</i>
      <i> diminish that view.</i>

39:20.492 --> 39:23.360
<i> I'm not ready to go back</i>
<i> to a world without that light.</i>

39:24.396 --> 39:25.829
  <i> I want this feeling to last.</i>

39:27.799 --> 39:30.400
    <i> I want to leave</i>
    <i> something more than</i>
    <i> impressive report cards</i>

39:30.402 --> 39:32.068
       <i> To remember me by.</i>

39:32.070 --> 39:34.838
      <i> There is so much</i>
      <i> beauty in the world.</i>

39:34.840 --> 39:36.606
  <i> And that's all that matters.</i>

39:36.608 --> 39:38.942
       <i> Inspiration. Love.</i>

39:38.944 --> 39:41.444
<i> The heart wants what it wants.</i>

39:41.446 --> 39:42.812
     <i> Who are we to deny it?</i>

39:45.417 --> 39:48.017
    Apparently, that mix cd
    was a gateway drug.

39:48.019 --> 39:49.986
    I'm going to need
    a more substantial fix.

39:49.988 --> 39:52.722
        Oh, uh... Okay.

39:52.724 --> 39:53.823
          Come on in.

40:00.399 --> 40:02.866
    Did you want me to
    lend you something or...

40:02.868 --> 40:04.467
      I want you
      to come sit with me.

40:05.237 --> 40:06.369
         Are you drunk?

40:06.371 --> 40:08.271
       I just want to be
       here with you.

40:09.307 --> 40:10.540
        Let's hang out.

40:11.910 --> 40:13.810
     You want to hang out?

40:13.812 --> 40:17.080
     Am i gonna come
     over there or are you
     gonna come over here?

40:17.082 --> 40:20.583
 I just think that you're being
 really weird right now.

40:21.453 --> 40:23.319
              Come

40:23.321 --> 40:24.521
          Sit with me.

40:31.730 --> 40:35.265
  I can't take another second
  of not being close to you.

40:35.267 --> 40:36.533
         I just can't.

40:39.604 --> 40:40.904
      What the hell, liv?

40:43.175 --> 40:45.642
     You can't take
     not being close to me?

40:45.644 --> 40:47.076
          Since when?

40:47.078 --> 40:50.146
    You've been icing me out
    for six months.

40:50.148 --> 40:52.048
        I did everything

40:52.050 --> 40:55.585
 To try to get just one moment
 of anything even remotely
 affectionate from you.

40:55.587 --> 40:57.387
      You gave me nothing.

40:57.389 --> 40:58.621
     The day i came
     to drop off your stuff

40:58.623 --> 41:00.623
      You could barely
      look me in the eye.

41:00.625 --> 41:03.827
     And now you can't take
     not being close to me?

41:03.829 --> 41:04.861
        You need to go.

41:04.863 --> 41:06.830
    -Major...
    -No, just go, all right?

41:22.747 --> 41:24.881
       Liv: <i> The passionate</i>
      <i> mind is selfish.</i>

41:24.883 --> 41:26.883
       <i> It's so focused on</i>
       <i> what it desires,</i>

41:26.885 --> 41:29.452
       <i> Reason becomes</i>
       <i> background noise.</i>

41:29.454 --> 41:33.189
  <i> Javier's brain made me</i>
  <i> cross the line that divides</i>
  <i> what i long for</i>

41:33.191 --> 41:35.725
   <i> And what i can never have.</i>

41:35.727 --> 41:37.627
  <i> There were so many nights</i>
  <i> i could have been with major</i>

41:37.629 --> 41:39.562
  <i> That i stayed home studying.</i>

41:39.564 --> 41:40.630
    <i> Days i could have spent</i>

41:40.632 --> 41:42.031
       <i> Sucking the marrow</i>
       <i> out of life,</i>

41:42.033 --> 41:45.635
   <i> I spent building a resume</i>
   <i> for a life i'd never have.</i>

41:45.637 --> 41:49.439
   <i> There were parts of me</i>
   <i> that were dead even</i>
   <i> before i became a zombie.</i>

41:49.441 --> 41:54.277
 <i> So maybe that means</i>
 <i> it's possible for parts of me</i>
 <i> to spring to life,</i>

41:54.279 --> 41:56.179
    <i> Even now that i'm dead.</i>
