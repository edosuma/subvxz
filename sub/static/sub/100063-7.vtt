I think he just found a place
for me to stay.

21:12.967 --> 21:14.490
What are you talking about?
You're gonna stay with me.

21:14.534 --> 21:16.057
Ah, it's cool, man,
he's got me covered.

21:16.100 --> 21:18.189
Ice, come on, man.
You're family.

21:18.233 --> 21:19.713
You're my family.

21:19.756 --> 21:21.236
You're staying with me,
no arguments.

21:23.891 --> 21:25.588
I'll be right back.

21:31.681 --> 21:33.030
Thanks for coming.

21:33.074 --> 21:35.511
Maybe I'm overthinking this,

21:35.555 --> 21:37.078
but the last time
I saw somebody

21:37.121 --> 21:39.167
cough up that much
blood was my uncle.

21:39.210 --> 21:40.603
I was nine years old.

21:40.647 --> 21:41.909
Family never
talked about it,

21:41.952 --> 21:43.606
then one day he just
stopped coming by.

21:43.650 --> 21:45.739
Well, I can run this sample
for cancer cells,

21:45.782 --> 21:47.958
see what I can find.Thanks.

21:49.699 --> 21:51.484
You sure you don't want
to just ask him?

21:51.527 --> 21:53.529
[sighs]:
I could.

21:53.573 --> 21:55.401
But I don't think
he'd tell me the truth.

21:55.444 --> 21:56.576

Hey.

22:10.851 --> 22:12.374
I heard about
you and Abby.

Sorry. Breakups
are tough.

Believe me,
I've been there.

Those other tracks are about
the size of suitcase rollers.

You know we're not
gonna do that, right?

assaults, couple B and Es.

a connection to Tony Zhao.

23:45.902 --> 23:48.644
One of Oahu's
favorite crime bosses.

23:48.688 --> 23:51.386
So this could be a mob hit?Maybe.

23:51.430 --> 23:52.996
I'm gonna go talk to Zhao.I'll go with you.

23:53.040 --> 23:55.129
Sorry. This time I'm gonna have
to insist that you stay put.

23:55.172 --> 23:57.348
Why?Because talking to a suspect

23:57.392 --> 24:00.830
is beyond the scope of your
temp job as hotel dick. Besides,

24:00.874 --> 24:02.397
Zhao and I have history.

24:02.441 --> 24:04.486
But since I also know that
there's no point in telling you

24:04.530 --> 24:06.836
to stand down, if you find
anything else, call me.

24:06.880 --> 24:08.229
You know, Gordie, I feel like

24:08.272 --> 24:10.623
we're really settling
into a nice rhythm here.

24:10.666 --> 24:12.407
I wouldn't say that.I'm saying it.

24:12.451 --> 24:14.061
Yeah, but saying it
doesn't make it real.

we've been doing this dance
for years now.

You've never had enough to
arrest me, much less charge me.

24:35.865 --> 24:38.825
So why am I even talking to you?

care for some coffee?

Forget it, Mia.

Your wife left you.

One of your guys is dead.
Why don't we focus on that?

25:03.066 --> 25:04.720
One of my guys?

25:04.764 --> 25:06.853
Just because I've had
a few indiscretions

25:06.896 --> 25:09.333
doesn't mean I know anyone
with a record.

25:09.377 --> 25:11.858
This is bordering on harassment.

25:11.901 --> 25:13.729
Cut the crap.

25:13.773 --> 25:15.731
We know Chen was part
of your crew.

25:15.775 --> 25:18.081
We had him talking to you
on a wire months ago.

25:18.125 --> 25:21.955
Why do you care so much if one
of my guys is on a slab?

25:21.998 --> 25:25.654
Truth? I don't.

25:25.698 --> 25:27.743
But someone else may have been
killed in connection with this,

25:27.787 --> 25:29.615
and solving her murder
I do care about.

25:29.658 --> 25:32.922
I'm gonna say this once,
then you can get out

25:32.966 --> 25:34.010

doing here?

Uh, well,

26:54.134 --> 26:55.831
we did a deep dive on Chen.

26:55.875 --> 26:57.616
And he must've used a burner,

26:57.659 --> 26:59.139
because we checked
his cell phone records,

26:59.182 --> 27:00.140
couldn't find anything.

27:00.183 --> 27:01.445
No surprise there.

27:01.489 --> 27:03.360
No, but we did find something
rather curious

27:03.404 --> 27:04.884
in his mobile payment account.

27:04.927 --> 27:06.581
Multiple payments to Red,

Sizable amounts, too.

27:10.193 --> 27:11.586
He lied to us.

27:11.630 --> 27:13.414
He definitely knew Chen,
and he clearly knows

27:13.457 --> 27:14.676
a lot more than he's letting on.

27:14.720 --> 27:17.548

always do what your bosses say?

27:26.166 --> 27:27.646
Yes,

27:27.689 --> 27:29.256

in the grown-up world

27:29.299 --> 27:31.780
where you have a mortgage, car
payments and child support.

27:31.824 --> 27:34.435

if you had any of those things.

ask you once.

27:54.411 --> 27:56.631
What was Johnny Chen doing
in that suite?

27:57.806 --> 27:59.765
He was having an affair.

27:59.808 --> 28:01.810
He wanted to maintain
a low profile.

28:01.854 --> 28:03.682
It's the same reason
anyone books that room.

28:03.725 --> 28:04.813
An affair with whom?

28:04.857 --> 28:06.989
A woman named Mia Zhao.

28:08.121 --> 28:09.383
Zhao.

28:09.426 --> 28:11.124
Any relationship to Tony Zhao?

28:11.167 --> 28:12.821
His wife.

28:12.865 --> 28:14.736
Her and Johnny have been
banging in that room

28:14.780 --> 28:16.607
at least once a week
for the past six months.

28:17.652 --> 28:19.698
Including yesterday?

28:21.090 --> 28:23.223
I snuck her onto the grounds
through a back entrance

28:23.266 --> 28:24.572
after I dropped off
Johnny's bag.

28:25.704 --> 28:27.183
When was the last time
you saw 'em?

28:27.227 --> 28:31.144
Uh, I brought over
some room service

28:31.187 --> 28:34.974
for Johnny a couple hours later,
but by then, Mia was gone.

28:39.456 --> 28:42.329
Perhaps Tony found out about
the liaisons and killed Johnny.

28:42.372 --> 28:44.157
Yeah, he sneaks out
the body, dumps it,

28:44.200 --> 28:45.985

kills Georgia.

No, it looks like
Tony could be our killer.

Well, if he knew about the
affair, he certainly had motive.

28:55.255 --> 28:57.344
Would be nice if we had
some hard evidence.

28:57.387 --> 28:59.999
All right,
I'm gonna loop my boss in.

29:00.042 --> 29:02.653

where Mia Zhao is.

29:02.697 --> 29:03.959
If we're right
about Tony,

29:04.003 --> 29:06.179
he could be looking
to get rid of her next.

He's not here.

29:19.148 --> 29:21.890

on a supply run.

with my office,

together.

He gave you that napkin with my
bloody snot on it, didn't he?

29:46.088 --> 29:49.439
Maybe you should talk to Rick
about this.

You don't have to bother
analyzing it, Doc.

29:52.007 --> 29:54.836

30:01.538 --> 30:04.803

But I'm not so sure
that Rick is gonna be able to.

30:08.850 --> 30:12.332
Which is why I'd like you
to not tell him.

30:14.029 --> 30:16.031
You want me to lie to him?

30:18.033 --> 30:20.993
Rick's my friend. I...I understand.

30:21.036 --> 30:22.864
But I got one foot in the grave.

30:22.908 --> 30:25.998
If he knows...

30:26.041 --> 30:27.303
it'll wreck him.

30:27.347 --> 30:30.872
Look, he said that you're
the closest thing

30:30.916 --> 30:32.700
that he has to a father.

30:32.743 --> 30:34.528
Don't you think
he has the right to know?

30:34.571 --> 30:35.921
You don't know him like I do.

30:35.964 --> 30:38.140
You just got to trust me, Doc.

30:38.184 --> 30:39.968
This is the best way.

30:43.972 --> 30:46.583
I believe that everyone
should die on their own terms,

but what you're asking of me...

30:48.107 --> 30:52.111
Wh-Wh-What, what I'm asking you
is to just consider it.

30:52.154 --> 30:53.982
That's all.

Please.

It seems Mia switched her phone
off two hours ago,

How'd you know she was coming?
Did she call?

Did you text her?

I think he knows."

he doesn't, but I wish he did.

32:04.487 --> 32:06.228
I'm tired
of sneaking around."

32:06.272 --> 32:08.100
He was about to let
the cat out of the bag.

32:08.143 --> 32:11.016
What would you do about it
if you were Mia?

32:11.059 --> 32:13.018
Silence him.

32:13.061 --> 32:14.584
So we may have been
looking at this wrong.
