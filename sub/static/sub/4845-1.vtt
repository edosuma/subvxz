00:21.783 --> 00:23.993
- Hello?
- Hello.

00:24.033 --> 00:26.493
- Yes?
- Who is this?

00:26.533 --> 00:27.997
Who you trying to reach?

00:28.023 --> 00:29.583
What number is this?

00:29.623 --> 00:32.583
- What number are you trying to reach?
- I don't know.

00:32.622 --> 00:35.083
- I think you have the wrong number.
- Do I?

00:35.123 --> 00:37.583
It happens.
Take it easy.

00:45.803 --> 00:49.263
- Hello!
- I'm sorry. I guess I dialed the wrong number.

00:49.303 --> 00:51.370
So, why'd you dial it again?

00:51.396 --> 00:52.773
To apologize.

00:52.813 --> 00:54.476
You're forgiven.
Bye, now.

00:54.502 --> 00:56.523
Wait, wait! Don't hang up.

00:56.563 --> 00:58.943
- What?
- I wanna talk to you for a second.

00:58.983 --> 01:02.113
They've got 900-numbers for that.
See ya.

01:23.383 --> 01:26.133
- Hello.
- Why don't you want to talk to me?

01:26.173 --> 01:26.991
Who is this?

01:27.017 --> 01:30.263
You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.

01:30.303 --> 01:33.273
- I don't think so.

01:33.313 --> 01:35.603
- What's that noise?
- Popcorn.

01:35.643 --> 01:37.603
- You're making popcorn?
- Uh-huh.

01:37.643 --> 01:39.903
I only eat popcorn at the movies.

01:39.943 --> 01:43.283
- Well, I'm getting ready to watch a video.
- Really? What?

01:43.323 --> 01:45.363
Oh, just some scary movie.

01:45.363 --> 01:47.743
- You like scary movies?
- Uh-huh.

01:47.743 --> 01:49.873
What's your favorite scary movie?

01:49.873 --> 01:50.860
Uh, I don't know.

01:50.886 --> 01:52.833
You have to have a favorite.

01:52.873 --> 01:54.833
What comes to mind?

01:54.873 --> 01:56.833
Um..."Halloween."

01:56.873 --> 01:59.253
You know, the one with the guy in the white mask...

01:59.293 --> 02:02.213
who walks around and stalks baby-sitters.

02:02.213 --> 02:04.213
- Yeah.
- What's yours?

02:04.213 --> 02:08.723
- Guess.
- Um..."Nightmare on Elm Street."

02:08.723 --> 02:11.553
Is that the one where the guy had knives for fingers?

02:11.553 --> 02:12.651
Yeah, Freddy Krueger.

02:12.677 --> 02:14.063
Freddy, that's right.

02:14.063 --> 02:15.577
I liked that movie.

02:15.603 --> 02:16.773
It was scary.

02:16.813 --> 02:19.393
Yeah, the first one was, but the rest sucked.

02:19.393 --> 02:21.443
So, you got a boyfriend?

02:21.443 --> 02:24.733
Why?
You wanna ask me out on a date?

02:24.733 --> 02:27.363
Maybe.
Do you have a boyfriend?

02:27.403 --> 02:30.613
- Mm... no.
- You never told me your name.

02:30.663 --> 02:32.623
Why do you want to know my name?

02:32.663 --> 02:36.083
'Cause I wanna know who I'm looking at.

02:36.083 --> 02:37.579
What did you say?

02:37.605 --> 02:40.923
I wanna know who I'm talking to.

02:40.923 --> 02:42.262
That's not what you said.

02:42.288 --> 02:43.948
What do you think I said?

02:46.003 --> 02:48.093
What?

02:49.263 --> 02:51.303
Hello?

02:51.343 --> 02:53.603
Look, I gotta go.

02:53.603 --> 02:55.603
Wait! I thought we were gonna go out.

02:55.603 --> 02:57.973
Uh, nah, I don't think so.

02:58.023 --> 02:59.983
Don't hang up on me!

03:08.323 --> 03:10.653
Shit.

03:10.703 --> 03:14.453
- Yes?
- I told you not to hang up on me.

03:14.453 --> 03:16.623
- What do you want?
- To talk.

03:16.623 --> 03:19.333
Well, dial someone else, okay?

03:28.633 --> 03:29.520
Listen, asshole!

03:29.546 --> 03:31.683
No, you listen, you little bitch!

03:31.723 --> 03:35.973
You hang up on me again, I'll cut you like a fish, understand?

03:35.973 --> 03:38.563
Yeah.

03:38.603 --> 03:40.563
Is this some kind of joke?

03:40.603 --> 03:43.063
More of a game, really.

03:44.603 --> 03:47.823
Can you handle that...

03:47.863 --> 03:50.323
blondie?

04:00.413 --> 04:02.373
Can you see me?

04:05.333 --> 04:09.923
Listen, I am two seconds away from calling the police.

04:09.963 --> 04:11.835
They'd never make it in time.

04:11.861 --> 04:14.223
We're out in the middle of nowhere.

04:14.263 --> 04:15.755
What do you want?

04:15.781 --> 04:19.378
To see what your insides look like.

04:27.653 --> 04:29.087
Who's there?

04:29.513 --> 04:31.218
Who's there?

04:32.323 --> 04:34.283
- I'm calling the police.

04:36.663 --> 04:39.033
You should never say, "Who's there?"

04:39.033 --> 04:40.519
Don't you watch scary movies?

04:40.545 --> 04:41.543
It's a death wish.

04:41.543 --> 04:46.213
You might as well just come out here to
investigate a strange noise or somethin'.

04:46.213 --> 04:49.713
Look, you've had your fun now...

04:49.713 --> 04:53.343
- so I think you better just leave or else.
- Or else what?

04:53.383 --> 04:58.053
Or else my boyfriend'll be here any second,
and he'll be pissed when he finds out.

04:58.053 --> 05:00.063
I thought you didn't have a boyfriend.

05:00.063 --> 05:03.983
I lied! I do have a boyfriend, and he'll be here any second...

05:04.023 --> 05:07.103
- so your ass better be gone.
- Sure.

05:07.153 --> 05:09.653
I swear.

05:09.693 --> 05:14.613
He's big, and he plays football and he'll kick the shit out of you!

05:14.613 --> 05:16.006
I'm getting scared.

05:16.032 --> 05:17.913
I'm shaking in my boots.

05:17.913 --> 05:20.413
So you better just leave.

05:20.413 --> 05:22.413
His name wouldn't be...

05:22.413 --> 05:25.413
Steve, would it?

05:25.413 --> 05:28.423
How do you know his name?

05:28.423 --> 05:32.423
Turn on the patio lights... again.

05:44.433 --> 05:46.603
Oh, God!

05:46.603 --> 05:48.944
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

05:48.970 --> 05:50.363
Where are you?

05:50.403 --> 05:52.483
- Guess.
- Please don't hurt him.

05:52.523 --> 05:53.732
That all depends on you.

05:53.758 --> 05:55.193
Why are you doing this?

05:55.243 --> 05:57.743
- I wanna play a game.
- No.

05:57.783 --> 06:00.413
- Then he dies right now!
- No! No!

06:00.453 --> 06:02.348
Which is it?

06:02.774 --> 06:04.993
Which is it?

06:05.043 --> 06:09.003
Wha... What kind of game?

06:09.043 --> 06:10.852
Turn off the light.

06:10.878 --> 06:13.803
You'll see what kind of game.

06:13.803 --> 06:15.803
Just do it!

06:17.923 --> 06:20.933
Casey! No! No!

06:20.973 --> 06:23.053
No! Casey!

06:23.103 --> 06:25.063
Here's how we play.

06:25.103 --> 06:26.535
I ask a question.

06:26.561 --> 06:29.483
If you get it right, Steve lives.

06:29.483 --> 06:30.503
Please don't do this.

06:30.529 --> 06:31.863
Come on. It'll be fun.

06:31.863 --> 06:33.943
- Please...
- It's an easy category.

06:33.983 --> 06:35.943
- Please...
- Movie trivia.

06:35.983 --> 06:37.659
I'll even give you a warm-up question.

06:37.685 --> 06:38.863
Don't do this. I can't.

06:38.903 --> 06:42.373
- Name the killer in "Halloween."
- No.

06:42.413 --> 06:45.373
Come on! 
It's your favorite scary movie, remember?

06:45.413 --> 06:48.713
- He had a white mask; he stalked the baby-sitters.
- I don't know.

06:48.753 --> 06:51.713
- Come on. Yes, you do.
- No, please.

06:51.753 --> 06:53.197
What's his name?

06:53.223 --> 06:55.003
I can't think.

06:55.003 --> 06:57.553
Steve's counting on you.

06:57.593 --> 07:00.683
Michael...
Michael, Michael.

07:00.683 --> 07:03.303
Yes! Very good.

07:03.343 --> 07:05.313
Now for the real question.

07:05.353 --> 07:07.723
- No!
- But you're doing so well.

07:07.773 --> 07:08.971
We can't stop now.

07:08.997 --> 07:11.233
Please stop! Leave us alone!

07:11.233 --> 07:14.363
Answer the question.
Same category.

07:14.363 --> 07:17.363
Oh, please stop.

07:17.363 --> 07:20.533
Name the killer in "Friday the 13th."

07:20.533 --> 07:23.243
Jason! Jason, Jason!

07:23.283 --> 07:26.373
I'm sorry.
That's the wrong answer.

07:26.413 --> 07:28.663
No, it's not! 
No, it's not.

07:28.689 --> 07:29.913
It was Jason.

07:29.953 --> 07:32.213
Afraid not. 
No way.

07:32.213 --> 07:33.687
Listen, it was Jason!

07:33.713 --> 07:36.213
I saw that movie 20 goddamn times!

07:36.253 --> 07:39.423
Then you should know Jason's mother, Mrs. Voorhees, was the original killer.

07:39.463 --> 07:41.803
Jason didn't show up until the sequel.

07:41.843 --> 07:44.763
I'm afraid that was a wrong answer.

07:44.763 --> 07:46.763
You tricked me.

07:46.763 --> 07:48.853
Lucky for you there's a bonus round.

07:48.893 --> 07:50.434
But poor Steve.

07:50.460 --> 07:52.718
I'm afraid he's out!

08:17.043 --> 08:21.053
Hey, we're not finished yet.

08:22.383 --> 08:23.980
Final question.

08:24.006 --> 08:25.683
Are you ready?

08:25.723 --> 08:29.933
Please, please, leave me alone.

08:29.933 --> 08:31.933
Answer the question, and I will.

08:33.273 --> 08:36.732
What door am I at?

08:36.773 --> 08:40.403
- What?
- There are two main doors to your house.

08:40.443 --> 08:42.403
The front door, the patio doors.

08:42.443 --> 08:44.403
If you answer correctly, you live.

08:44.453 --> 08:46.703
Very simple.

08:46.743 --> 08:48.071
Don't do this.

08:48.097 --> 08:49.873
I can't; I won't.

08:49.913 --> 08:52.503
Your call.

10:20.173 --> 10:22.213
- Aah!

11:14.933 --> 11:18.273
Did you water over here today?

11:18.273 --> 11:19.597
It was just that water from the rain.

11:19.623 --> 11:20.813
They look great, don't they?

11:20.853 --> 11:21.963
Don't they smell strong?

11:21.989 --> 11:23.838
I told you you could send it back.

11:26.863 --> 11:29.443
Mom!

11:29.443 --> 11:31.783
- Jesus!
- What is it?

11:45.593 --> 11:47.633
Casey!

11:50.973 --> 11:53.383
Oh, G...

11:55.223 --> 11:57.353
Casey. Casey.

11:57.393 --> 11:59.353
Casey!

12:01.353 --> 12:03.733
- Where is she?
- Call the police!

12:08.983 --> 12:10.943
- Casey!

12:10.993 --> 12:12.269
Casey, are you upstairs?

12:12.295 --> 12:13.863
Oh, my God. Casey, baby?

12:13.913 --> 12:15.873
- Casey?
- She's here.

12:15.913 --> 12:18.373
- Mom.
- Oh, my God, I can hear her.

12:18.413 --> 12:19.097
Mom.

12:19.123 --> 12:21.858
Where is she?

12:23.833 --> 12:25.833
Oh, my God!
I can hear her.

12:25.833 --> 12:27.843
- Hey!

12:30.513 --> 12:31.790
Get in the car.

12:31.816 --> 12:34.513
Drive down to the MacKenzies'.

12:34.513 --> 12:37.933
- No. No, not my daughter.
- Just go.

12:37.973 --> 12:39.933
- Not my daughter.
- Call the police.

13:22.353 --> 13:25.023
- It's just me.

13:25.063 --> 13:26.688
Billy, what are you doing here?

13:26.714 --> 13:28.103
Sorry, don't hate me.

13:28.153 --> 13:30.483
- You sleep in that?
- Yes, I sleep in this.

13:30.523 --> 13:31.599
My dad is in the other room.

13:31.625 --> 13:32.483
You can't be in here.

13:32.533 --> 13:34.903
- I'll just stay a sec.

13:34.903 --> 13:37.033
No... You gotta go. Go, go, go.

13:37.073 --> 13:39.243
What's going on in there?

13:39.243 --> 13:41.243
- Are you okay?
- Can you knock?

13:41.243 --> 13:43.163
- I heard screaming.
- No, you didn't.

13:43.203 --> 13:45.543
No?

13:45.583 --> 13:48.713
Oh, well.
I'm hitting the sack.

13:48.753 --> 13:51.253
My flight leaves first thing in the morning.

13:51.253 --> 13:54.383
Now, the expo runs all weekend, so I won't be back 'til Sunday.

13:54.423 --> 13:57.763
- There's cash on the table, and I'm staying at...
- The Hilton.

13:57.763 --> 14:00.723
- Out at the airport, so call if...
- I need anything.

14:00.763 --> 14:03.813
I could've sworn I heard screaming.

14:03.853 --> 14:05.933
Have a good trip, okay?

14:05.933 --> 14:07.943
Sleep tight, sweetie.

14:12.863 --> 14:14.483
Oh... close call.

14:14.533 --> 14:17.363
Billy, what're you doing here?

14:17.403 --> 14:19.363
It occurred to me that...

14:19.413 --> 14:21.623
- I've never snuck through your bedroom window.
- Shh, shh, shh.

14:21.663 --> 14:24.373
Great idea, now that it's out of your system.

14:24.413 --> 14:26.373
I was home watching television.

14:26.413 --> 14:28.923
"The," uh, "The Exorcist" was on.

14:28.963 --> 14:32.843
- It got me thinking of you.
- It did?

14:32.883 --> 14:34.401
Yeah, it was edited for TV.

14:34.427 --> 14:36.763
You know, all the good stuff was cut out.

14:36.803 --> 14:41.143
And it got me thinking of us...

14:41.143 --> 14:44.813
how two years ago we started off hot and heavy.

14:44.813 --> 14:48.773
Nice solid R-rating on our way to an NC-17.

14:50.233 --> 14:53.733
And now...
things have changed and...

14:58.823 --> 15:02.243
lately we're just sort of edited for television.

15:02.283 --> 15:06.703
Oh, so you thought you would climb in my window...

15:06.703 --> 15:09.913
- and we'd have a little raw footage?
- No.

15:09.963 --> 15:14.173
No, I wouldn't dream of breaking your underwear rule.

15:14.173 --> 15:19.173
I just thought maybe we could do a little on-top-of-the-clothes stuff.

15:21.883 --> 15:26.103
- Okay.
- Yeah?

15:26.143 --> 15:28.103
Yeah.

15:28.143 --> 15:32.103
If we ever fly away

15:32.143 --> 15:36.573
Baby, I'm with you

15:36.613 --> 15:41.493
Baby, I'm your man

15:41.533 --> 15:43.493
Hey.

15:47.913 --> 15:50.095
La, la, la,

15:50.521 --> 15:53.568
la la, la, la

15:58.633 --> 15:59.918
Okay. Okay, okay.

15:59.944 --> 16:01.883
Time is up, stud-muffin.

16:01.883 --> 16:04.893
God, you see what you do to me?

16:04.893 --> 16:08.393
You know what my dad'll do to you?

16:08.893 --> 16:10.893
Yeah.

16:10.893 --> 16:13.893
- I'm going.
- Okay.

16:17.233 --> 16:20.193
Romeo and Juliet

16:20.233 --> 16:23.113
Are together in eternity

16:23.153 --> 16:25.783
You know, l...
I appreciate the romantic gesture.

16:25.823 --> 16:27.783
So, come on, baby

16:27.833 --> 16:31.703
Hey, about the, uh, the sex stuff?

16:31.753 --> 16:34.463
I'm not trying to rush you at all.

16:34.503 --> 16:36.963
I was only half serious.

16:37.003 --> 16:39.423
Okay.

16:39.423 --> 16:42.723
Baby, I'm your man

16:43.973 --> 16:47.393
Baby, I'm your man

16:47.433 --> 16:49.393
Hey, Billy.

16:49.433 --> 16:53.733
Would you settle for a PG-13 relationship?

16:53.773 --> 16:56.483
What's that?

16:56.523 --> 16:59.133
- La, la,

16:59.159 --> 17:02.033
la-la, la

17:02.073 --> 17:05.992
My God.
You're just a tease.

17:12.953 --> 17:16.083
Thirty-five...

17:16.123 --> 17:18.833
Situation under control.

17:18.883 --> 17:21.843
Roger, dispatch.

17:21.883 --> 17:24.673
There's blood found?
All right.

17:39.813 --> 17:42.943
...are doing drugs they buy in the classrooms...

17:42.983 --> 17:45.443
and that they are involved in the occult.

17:45.493 --> 17:47.743
Occult?

17:47.783 --> 17:50.873
Woodsboro, California, was devastated last night...

17:50.913 --> 17:53.703
when two young teenagers were found brutally murdered.

17:53.743 --> 17:55.913
Authorities have yet to issue a statement...

17:55.963 --> 17:59.423
but our sources tell us that no arrest has been made...

17:59.463 --> 18:00.516
and the murderer could strike again.

18:00.542 --> 18:01.423
Do you believe this shit?

18:01.463 --> 18:03.120
Damn! What is going on?

18:03.146 --> 18:04.633
You don't know?

18:04.673 --> 18:08.303
Casey Becker and Steve Orth were killed last night.

18:08.343 --> 18:10.303
What? No way.

18:10.343 --> 18:12.813
And we're not just talking killed; we're talking splatter-movie killed.

18:12.853 --> 18:14.893
Ripped open from end to end.

18:14.933 --> 18:17.523
Casey Becker, she sits next to me in English.

18:17.523 --> 18:19.523
Not anymore.
It's so sad.

18:19.523 --> 18:21.903
Her mom and dad, they found her hanging from a tree...

18:21.903 --> 18:24.863
- her insides on the outside.
- Oh, my God!

18:24.863 --> 18:26.863
Do they know who did it?

18:26.863 --> 18:30.243
Fucking clueless.
They're interrogating the entire school.

18:30.243 --> 18:31.359
Teachers, students, janitors.

18:31.385 --> 18:32.783
They think it's school-related?

18:32.833 --> 18:33.625
They don't know.

18:33.651 --> 18:36.793
Dewey was saying this is the worst crime they've seen in years.

18:36.833 --> 18:38.793
- Even worse than...

18:38.833 --> 18:41.543
Well... it's bad.

18:46.633 --> 18:48.428
Here you go, Mrs. Tate.

18:48.454 --> 18:50.248
Thank you, James.

18:53.013 --> 18:54.723
Sidney.

18:54.723 --> 18:57.143
It would appear to be your turn.

19:01.353 --> 19:02.610
Who's up next?

19:02.636 --> 19:04.943
Uh, Sidney Prescott.

19:04.983 --> 19:07.743
She was daughter of, uh...

19:09.073 --> 19:11.703
- Sidney, how you feelin'?
- Fine.

19:11.743 --> 19:14.073
Hi, Sidney.

19:14.073 --> 19:15.663
Sheriff Burke, Dewey.

19:15.703 --> 19:19.413
Uh, that's Deputy Riley today, Sid.

19:19.413 --> 19:22.883
- How is everything?
- Good.

19:22.923 --> 19:25.043
And your dad?
How's he doin'?

19:25.093 --> 19:26.221
We're fine. Thanks.

19:26.247 --> 19:29.013
We're gonna keep this very brief, Sidney.

19:29.053 --> 19:31.763
The police just want to ask you a few questions.
You okay?

19:31.763 --> 19:33.183
Mm-hmm.

19:33.223 --> 19:36.513
Sidney, were you very close to Casey Becker?

19:36.563 --> 19:40.183
Remember, your principal loves you, and I want you to be safe.

19:40.233 --> 19:43.943
All students are encouraged to return home promptly from school grounds.

19:43.943 --> 19:46.023
Avoid strangers; walk in twos and threes.

19:46.073 --> 19:48.033
What kind of questions did they ask you, Sidney?

19:48.073 --> 19:49.139
They asked if I knew Casey.

19:49.165 --> 19:50.283
They asked me that too.

19:50.323 --> 19:52.823
- Hey, did they ask if you like to hunt?
- Yeah, they did.

19:52.823 --> 19:54.823
Did they ask you?

19:54.823 --> 19:56.873
Why would they ask you if you liked to hunt?

19:56.913 --> 19:59.373
'Cause their bodies were gutted.

19:59.413 --> 20:00.337
Thank you, Randy.

20:00.363 --> 20:02.673
They didn't ask me if I like to hunt.

20:02.713 --> 20:05.793
- 'Cause there's no way a girl could've killed 'em.
- That is so sexist.

20:05.833 --> 20:08.503
The killer could easily be female.
"Basic Instinct."

20:08.553 --> 20:09.548
That was an ice pick.

20:09.574 --> 20:10.923
Not exactly the same thing.

20:10.973 --> 20:13.513
Yeah, Casey and Steve were completely hollowed out.

20:13.553 --> 20:16.143
And the fact is, it takes a man to do something like that.

20:16.143 --> 20:18.143
Or a man's mentality.

20:18.143 --> 20:20.683
How do you... gut someone?

20:23.983 --> 20:28.523
You take a knife, and you slit 'em from the groin to sternum.

20:28.573 --> 20:32.363
Hey, it's called tact, you fuck rag.

20:32.403 --> 20:34.613
Hey, Stu, didn't you used to date Casey?

20:34.663 --> 20:36.341
Yeah, for like two seconds.

20:36.367 --> 20:38.703
Before she dumped him for Steve.

20:38.743 --> 20:40.703
I thought you dumped her for me.

20:40.743 --> 20:41.773
I did. He's full of shit.

20:41.799 --> 20:44.123
And are the police aware that you dated the victim?

20:44.163 --> 20:45.892
Hey, what're you saying?

20:45.918 --> 20:47.333
That I killed her?

20:47.333 --> 20:49.383
It would certainly improve your high school "Q."

20:49.423 --> 20:53.303
- Stu was with me last night, okay?
- Yeah, I was.

20:53.343 --> 20:56.933
Was that before or after he sliced and diced?

20:56.973 --> 20:57.787
Fuck you, nutcase.

20:57.813 --> 20:59.053
Where were you last night?

20:59.103 --> 21:01.379
- Working, thank you.
- At the video store?

21:01.405 --> 21:02.983
I thought they fired your ass.

21:03.023 --> 21:05.023
Twice.

21:05.023 --> 21:06.820
I didn't kill anybody.

21:06.846 --> 21:08.943
Nobody said you did.

21:08.983 --> 21:10.693
Thanks, buddy.

21:10.693 --> 21:15.623
Besides, it takes a man to do something like that.

21:15.863 --> 21:17.868
I'm gonna gut your ass in a second, kid.

21:17.894 --> 21:18.993
Tell me something.

21:19.033 --> 21:21.493
Did you really put her liver in the mailbox?

21:21.543 --> 21:25.463
'Cause I heard that they found her liver in
the mailbox next to her spleen and pancreas.

21:25.503 --> 21:27.543
You goon! Fuck!
I'm trying to eat here.

21:27.583 --> 21:29.713
She's getting mad, all right?

21:29.753 --> 21:31.753
You better "liver" alone.

21:34.513 --> 21:37.553
"Liver" alone!

21:40.223 --> 21:43.813
"Liv..." Ow!
"Liver. Liver." It was a joke.

21:49.403 --> 21:52.573
See you, Sidney.
I'll talk to you tomorrow, Sid.

22:14.763 --> 22:19.223
So, you're sure I can stay over, 'cause
my dad won't be back 'til Sunday.

22:19.263 --> 22:21.513
No problem.
I'll pick you up after practice.

22:23.063 --> 22:25.023
You okay?

22:25.063 --> 22:27.523
Uh-huh. It's just...

22:27.563 --> 22:29.523
you know, the police and the reporters...

22:29.563 --> 22:31.523
it's like déjà  vu all over again.

22:31.563 --> 22:33.903
I'll be there by 7:00.
I promise.

22:33.943 --> 22:36.403
- Thanks, Tatum.
- Later.

23:24.073 --> 23:26.333
The bodies of 17-year-old Casey Becker...

23:26.333 --> 23:28.333
and her 18-year-old boyfriend, Steven Orth...

23:28.333 --> 23:30.333
..were discovered late last night by the girl's parents...

23:30.333 --> 23:32.463
The Woodsboro double murder case.

23:32.503 --> 23:35.503
Authorities are baffled by the lack of clues and the savage...

23:35.543 --> 23:39.133
The town's in shock, and no one can
quite believe what has happened here...

23:39.173 --> 23:41.933
although this is not the first time this small community...

23:41.973 --> 23:45.013
of Woodsboro has endured such tragedy.

23:45.013 --> 23:47.063
Only a year ago Maureen Prescott, wife and mother...

23:47.103 --> 23:51.603
was found raped and murdered not far from this peaceful town square.

25:02.053 --> 25:04.382
- Hello?
- Practice ran late.

25:04.408 --> 25:06.038
I'm on my way, okay?

25:07.893 --> 25:09.853
It's past 7:00.

25:09.893 --> 25:12.853
Don't worry.
Casey and Steve didn't bite it 'til way after 10:00.

25:12.893 --> 25:15.773
Oh. Oh, that's comforting.

25:15.773 --> 25:17.773
I'm gonna swing by the video store.

25:17.773 --> 25:19.773
I was thinkin' Tom Cruise, "All The Right Moves."

25:19.773 --> 25:22.693
If you pause it just right, you can see his penis.

25:22.733 --> 25:25.703
- Whatever. Just hurry, okay?
- Ta-ta, Sid.

25:36.503 --> 25:40.713
- Tatum, just get in the car...
- Hello, Sidney.

25:40.753 --> 25:44.553
Uh... hi, who is this?

25:44.593 --> 25:48.223
You tell me.

25:48.263 --> 25:50.723
Well, I-I have no idea.

25:50.763 --> 25:52.723
Scary night, isn't it?

25:52.763 --> 25:57.603
With the murders and all, it's like right
out of a horror movie or something.

25:57.643 --> 26:00.233
Randy, you gave yourself away.

26:00.273 --> 26:02.523
Are you calling from work, 'cause Tatum's on her way over.

26:02.573 --> 26:06.113
Do you like scary movies, Sidney?

26:06.153 --> 26:09.243
I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.

26:09.283 --> 26:11.993
What's your favorite scary movie?

26:12.033 --> 26:14.243
Oh, come on.
You know I don't watch that shit.

26:14.293 --> 26:16.873
- Why not? Too scared?
- No. No.

26:16.913 --> 26:18.060
It's just, what's the point?

26:18.086 --> 26:19.003
They're all the same.

26:19.043 --> 26:22.213
Some stupid killer stalking some big-breasted girl who can't act...

26:22.253 --> 26:25.213
who's always running up the stairs when
she should be going out the front door.

26:25.263 --> 26:29.223
- It's insulting.
- Are you alone in the house?

26:29.223 --> 26:30.587
Randy, that's so unoriginal.

26:30.613 --> 26:31.853
I'm disappointed in you.

26:31.853 --> 26:35.223
Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.

26:42.313 --> 26:44.273
So, who are you?

26:44.323 --> 26:46.363
The question isn't "Who am I?"

26:46.403 --> 26:49.913
The question is "Where am I?"

26:50.953 --> 26:54.033
S-S-So, where are you?

26:54.083 --> 26:56.083
Your front porch.

27:00.373 --> 27:02.833
Why would you be calling from my front porch?

27:02.883 --> 27:04.843
That's the original part.

27:06.553 --> 27:08.513
Oh, yeah?

27:12.053 --> 27:14.183
Well, I call your bluff.

27:26.903 --> 27:29.863
- So, where are you?
- Right here.

28:02.353 --> 28:04.943
- Can you see me right now?
- Uh-huh.

28:04.943 --> 28:06.943
Uh-huh, okay.

28:06.943 --> 28:09.993
What am I doin'? Huh?

28:09.993 --> 28:13.493
Huh? What am I doin'?
Hello!

28:14.783 --> 28:16.743
Nice try, Randy.

28:16.783 --> 28:19.163
Tell Tatum to hurry up, okay?
Bye now.

28:19.203 --> 28:21.833
If you hang up on me, you'll die just like your mother!

28:23.123 --> 28:25.824
Do you wanna die, Sidney?

28:25.850 --> 28:28.658
Your mother sure didn't.

28:29.763 --> 28:31.803
Fuck you, you cretin!

29:01.453 --> 29:02.833
No!

29:32.693 --> 29:34.693
Shit!

29:48.963 --> 29:51.593
Billy!

29:51.633 --> 29:52.384
The door's locked.

29:52.410 --> 29:53.843
I heard screaming.
You all right?

29:53.883 --> 29:55.843
The killer's here.
He's in the house.

29:55.883 --> 29:57.304
He's in the house.

29:57.330 --> 29:58.803
He's got a knife.

29:58.843 --> 30:01.473
He's gone.
He's gone.

30:01.513 --> 30:03.473
It's all right.

What?

30:18.573 --> 30:21.623
Sid, what?

30:22.913 --> 30:24.873
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait.
Wait, Sidney, wait!

30:24.913 --> 30:28.463
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
What's going on?

30:28.503 --> 30:30.954
Sidney, come back!

30:30.980 --> 30:32.068
Sidney!

30:35.923 --> 30:39.033
Sorry! I found this.

30:39.059 --> 30:40.433
Come on!

30:40.433 --> 30:42.433
All right, hold your hands together.

30:42.433 --> 30:44.433
Do you wish to give up your right to remain silent?

30:44.459 --> 30:45.433
I didn't do anything.

30:45.433 --> 30:47.433
Do you wish to give up your right to speak to an attorney...

30:47.433 --> 30:49.443
- And have them present during questioning?

30:49.443 --> 30:50.723
Ask her.

30:50.749 --> 30:53.443
She'll tell you.

30:53.443 --> 30:55.613
- I caught him, Sheriff.
- Wait. Who is that?

30:55.613 --> 30:56.411
Billy Loomis.

30:56.437 --> 30:59.113
Sheriff, Sheriff, call these guys off.

30:59.113 --> 31:02.283
I didn't do it.
Sheriff, wait.

31:02.283 --> 31:04.283
Wait, listen.
Call my dad.

31:04.283 --> 31:06.703
Please, call him.
He'll tell you. Call him.

31:06.753 --> 31:10.213
Sidney! Sidney!

31:10.253 --> 31:12.333
- How's she doing?
- Sid's tougher than she looks.

31:12.383 --> 31:15.343
She'd have to be, all the shit she's been through.

31:15.383 --> 31:18.843
- Sid!
- Well, we're seein' a lot of you today.

31:18.883 --> 31:22.723
You gonna be able to come down to the
station and answer a few questions, Sid?

31:22.763 --> 31:24.723
Oh, shit!
Sidney!

31:24.763 --> 31:26.154
God, Sid, I'm so sorry I was late.

31:26.180 --> 31:26.973
Are you all right?

31:27.023 --> 31:27.870
Tatum, you can't be here.

31:27.896 --> 31:29.023
This is an official crime scene.

31:29.023 --> 31:31.359
- It's okay.
- Her dad's out of town.

31:31.385 --> 31:32.773
She's staying with us.

31:32.813 --> 31:34.773
Does Mom know?

31:34.813 --> 31:37.283
- Yes, doofus.
- Let's get you out of here.

31:37.323 --> 31:39.283
- She'll be okay.
- Thanks.

31:39.323 --> 31:41.283
Oh, you won't believe this.

- What?

31:57.753 --> 31:59.209
Jesus! The camera, hurry!

31:59.235 --> 32:00.748
My name isn't Jesus.

32:02.633 --> 32:04.593
Sidney, is that you in there?

32:04.643 --> 32:06.603
Excuse me.
Is that Sidney Prescott they took away?

32:06.643 --> 32:07.545
I'm not talking to you.

32:07.571 --> 32:08.603
What happened to her?

32:08.643 --> 32:09.838
None of your damned business.

32:09.864 --> 32:12.063
I heard something about a costume.
Is that true?

32:12.063 --> 32:13.604
Can you tell me anything?

32:13.630 --> 32:16.193
Yeah, you're a real pain in the ass.

32:16.233 --> 32:18.733
Leave Sid alone.

32:18.733 --> 32:20.743
Where's she goin'?

32:21.743 --> 32:24.533
- Look. Kenny?
- Yeah?

32:24.573 --> 32:26.913
I know that you're about 50 pounds overweight...

32:26.953 --> 32:28.913
but when I say "hurry,"

32:28.953 --> 32:33.753
please interpret that as "move your fat, tub-of-lard ass now!"

32:35.543 --> 32:38.423
Did you find him?

32:38.463 --> 32:41.463
You sure it was the Hilton?

32:41.513 --> 32:43.029
At the airport.

32:43.055 --> 32:46.288
He's not registered there.

32:47.603 --> 32:50.603
Could he have stayed somewhere else?

32:50.603 --> 32:52.376
I don't know.

32:52.402 --> 32:53.853
I guess.

32:53.893 --> 32:56.193
Don't worry, Sid.

32:56.233 --> 32:57.271
We'll find him.

32:57.297 --> 32:59.718
Dewey, they got that mask in.

33:01.233 --> 33:03.193
I'll be right back.

33:11.043 --> 33:12.352
Let me ask you this.

33:12.378 --> 33:15.623
What're you doin' with a cellular telephone, son?

33:15.673 --> 33:17.633
Everybody's got one, Sheriff.

33:17.673 --> 33:20.923
I didn't make those calls, I swear.

33:20.923 --> 33:22.923
Check the phone bill, for Christ's sake.

33:22.923 --> 33:23.691
Call Vital Phone Comp.

33:23.717 --> 33:25.263
They got the records of every number dialed.

33:25.263 --> 33:28.223
Thanks, Hank.
We're on top of it.

33:28.263 --> 33:30.973
What were you doing over at Sidney's house tonight?

33:31.013 --> 33:33.563
I wanted to see her, that's all.

33:33.603 --> 33:34.363
And last night?

33:34.389 --> 33:37.403
Sidney said you crawled through her window last night too.

33:37.443 --> 33:39.813
You went out last night?

33:39.813 --> 33:42.205
I was watching TV.
I got bored.

33:42.231 --> 33:44.443
I decided to go for a ride.

33:44.443 --> 33:47.323
Did you happen to ride by Casey Becker's house?

33:47.363 --> 33:48.545
No, I didn't.

33:48.571 --> 33:51.478
Sheriff, I didn't kill anybody!

33:56.753 --> 33:59.883
We're gonna have to hold you, son, 'til we get those phone records.

34:02.803 --> 34:05.303
That's crazy.

34:05.303 --> 34:07.168
You know that?

34:07.194 --> 34:09.458
I didn't do it.

34:19.733 --> 34:21.902
Camera Two? Okay.

34:21.943 --> 34:24.233
Are there anymore doughnuts in there?

34:24.283 --> 34:25.148
Move it, Kenny.

34:25.174 --> 34:27.283
They're not lettin' anybody in.

34:27.322 --> 34:30.283
- I'm not just anyone.
- Bitch goddess.

34:30.322 --> 34:32.283
- Kenny, are we on?
- Yeah, go.

34:32.333 --> 34:34.793
Hi, Gale Weathers reporting live from Woodsboro police station...

34:34.833 --> 34:36.873
where we hope to get a glimpse of Sidney Prescott.

34:36.913 --> 34:39.135
- Hey, watch it, lady.
- Hey, watch the hand!

34:39.161 --> 34:40.922
Do you know who you're dealing with?

34:40.963 --> 34:43.963
Tell 'em.
Come on, Dad. Tell 'em!

34:44.003 --> 34:46.053
- He's waiting for the lawyer, Billy.
- Sidney!

34:46.092 --> 34:48.342
Sidney, come on.
You know me.

34:48.382 --> 34:51.223
Sidney, look at me!

34:51.263 --> 34:53.723
Come on!

34:58.023 --> 35:01.088
Sid, we're gonna get you out of here, okay?

35:01.114 --> 35:02.088
Are you okay?

35:03.733 --> 35:07.613
They sell this costume at every five-and-dime in the state.

35:07.653 --> 35:10.363
There's no way to track the purchase.

35:10.363 --> 35:12.703
What about that cellular phone bill?

35:12.703 --> 35:14.312
We're pulling Loomis's account.

35:14.338 --> 35:16.543
We won't know anything until the morning.

35:16.543 --> 35:20.003
Oh, come on!

35:20.043 --> 35:23.793
- You think he did it?
- Twenty years ago, I would've said, "Not a chance."

35:23.843 --> 35:28.673
But these kids today...
damned if I know.

35:28.723 --> 35:30.447
Hey, Dewey, can we go now?

35:30.473 --> 35:31.973
Hold on a second.

35:32.013 --> 35:33.323
Goddamn it, Dewey!

35:33.349 --> 35:35.433
What did Mama tell you?

35:35.433 --> 35:38.103
When I wear this badge, you treat me like a man of the law!

35:38.143 --> 35:40.393
I'm sorry, Deputy Dewey-boy, but we're ready to go.

35:40.393 --> 35:43.443
- Now, okay?
- Whoa.

35:43.483 --> 35:45.340
Take 'em out the back way.

35:45.366 --> 35:47.483
Avoid that circus out there.

35:47.533 --> 35:50.493
- Come on.
- Don't touch me!

35:50.533 --> 35:51.709
He's my superior.

35:51.735 --> 35:54.018
Janitors are your superior.

35:56.413 --> 35:58.373
Let's get back to work!

36:04.043 --> 36:06.883
- Isn't there a back way out of this building?
- Yeah.

36:06.923 --> 36:09.383
Down that alley, I think.

36:12.223 --> 36:13.703
You guys just stay here.

36:13.729 --> 36:15.183
I'm gonna get the car.

36:15.223 --> 36:17.183
Don't move.
Don't make a sound.

36:18.893 --> 36:21.943
There she is. Sidney!

36:21.943 --> 36:23.182
Hi, that's some night.

36:23.208 --> 36:25.153
What happened?
Are you all right?

36:25.193 --> 36:26.662
She's not answering any questions.

36:26.688 --> 36:27.613
Just leave us alone.

36:27.613 --> 36:28.474
No, Tatum, it's okay.

36:28.500 --> 36:30.113
She's just doin' her job, right, Gale?

36:30.113 --> 36:31.578
Yes, that's right.

36:31.604 --> 36:33.613
So, how's the book?

36:33.613 --> 36:35.663
Well, it'll be out later this year.

36:35.703 --> 36:38.033
Oh, I'll look for it.

36:38.083 --> 36:41.003
I'll send you a copy.

36:41.043 --> 36:43.253
Jeez.

36:43.293 --> 36:45.883
- Nice shot.
- Bitch.

36:45.923 --> 36:47.044
No, I mean, camera shot.

36:47.070 --> 36:49.053
Where'd you learn to punch like that?

36:49.093 --> 36:50.248
God, I loved it.

36:50.274 --> 36:52.053
"I'll send you a copy."

36:52.093 --> 36:54.053
Bam! Bitch went down.

36:54.093 --> 36:56.549
"I'll send you a copy." Bam!

36:56.575 --> 36:58.303
Sid... Superbitch!

36:58.353 --> 37:00.353
You are so cool.

37:00.353 --> 37:02.683
Thought you might want some ice for that right hook.

37:02.733 --> 37:04.943
Thanks.

37:04.983 --> 37:06.838
I'll be right next door.

37:06.864 --> 37:08.693
Try to get some sleep.

37:08.733 --> 37:10.693
Yeah, yeah.

37:14.323 --> 37:18.533
- Do you really think Billy did it?

37:18.583 --> 37:20.543
He was there, Tatum.

37:20.583 --> 37:22.968
He was destined to have a flaw.

37:22.994 --> 37:25.123
I knew he was too perfect.

37:25.163 --> 37:27.633
- Telephone, honey.

37:27.673 --> 37:29.633
- Who is it?
- It's for Sid.

37:29.673 --> 37:31.463
My dad?

37:31.503 --> 37:34.383
- I don't think so.
- Take a message.

37:34.423 --> 37:36.383
No, um, I'll get it.

37:40.313 --> 37:42.723
How's she doin'?

37:44.773 --> 37:46.773
Hello.

37:46.813 --> 37:49.153
Hello, Sidney.

37:49.193 --> 37:51.363
No!

37:51.363 --> 37:53.363
Poor Billy-boyfriend.

37:53.363 --> 37:56.243
An innocent guy doesn't stand a chance with you.

37:56.283 --> 37:57.221
Leave me alone!

37:57.247 --> 38:00.533
Looks like you fingered the wrong guy... again.

38:00.583 --> 38:03.123
- Who are you?
- Dewey! - Hang up, Sid.

38:03.163 --> 38:06.333
Don't worry.
You'll find out soon enough.

38:06.373 --> 38:09.293
- I promise.

38:09.333 --> 38:11.293
What?

38:14.343 --> 38:16.303
- What?
- What?

38:21.893 --> 38:23.893
Hello?

38:34.403 --> 38:38.203
Sidney Prescott, who escaped a vicious attack last night...

38:38.243 --> 38:40.203
is the daughter of Maureen Prescott...

38:40.243 --> 38:42.663
who was brutally killed last year...

38:42.703 --> 38:45.083
when convicted murderer Cotton Weary broke into their home...

38:45.083 --> 38:47.713
and savagely raped and tortured the deceased.

38:47.753 --> 38:50.923
Cotton Weary is currently awaiting appeal for the death sentence...

38:50.963 --> 38:54.173
handed down after the young Sidney testified against him.

38:54.213 --> 38:57.013
She was the key witness in the state's case against the...

38:59.263 --> 39:01.893
It's never gonna stop, is it?

39:01.933 --> 39:04.683
Billy was released.

39:04.723 --> 39:06.978
His cellular bill was clean.

39:07.004 --> 39:09.313
He didn't make those calls.

39:09.353 --> 39:11.943
We're checkin' every cellular account in the county.

39:11.943 --> 39:16.403
Any calls made to you or Casey Becker are being cross-referenced.

39:16.443 --> 39:19.073
It's gonna take some time, but we'll find him.

39:19.113 --> 39:21.663
Okay?

39:38.213 --> 39:39.926
Don't worry, Sid, it's school.

39:39.952 --> 39:41.183
You'll be safe here.

39:41.223 --> 39:43.683
So how does it feel to be almost brutally butchered?

39:43.723 --> 39:45.811
- Hey, leave her alone!
- People wanna know.

39:45.837 --> 39:47.063
They have a right to know.

39:47.103 --> 39:49.063
- Leave her alone.
- How does it feel?

39:49.103 --> 39:51.307
She just wants to get an education.

39:51.333 --> 39:52.693
Turn that thing off.

39:52.733 --> 39:55.193
What?

39:55.233 --> 39:58.363
Just a sec.

40:07.833 --> 40:10.203
Stop right there.

40:10.253 --> 40:11.418
I'm not here to fight.

40:11.444 --> 40:12.583
I just need to talk.

40:12.623 --> 40:13.588
Kenny, camera, now!

40:13.614 --> 40:15.213
Off the record.
No camera.

40:15.253 --> 40:16.159
Forget it.

40:16.185 --> 40:18.423
Please?
You owe me.

40:18.463 --> 40:19.428
I owe you shit!

40:19.454 --> 40:20.998
You owe my mother!

40:22.843 --> 40:25.723
Your mother's murder was last year's hottest court case.

40:25.763 --> 40:27.853
Somebody was gonna write about it.

40:27.853 --> 40:30.853
And it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories.

40:30.853 --> 40:32.122
What is your problem?

40:32.148 --> 40:33.693
You got what you wanted.

40:33.733 --> 40:34.966
Cotton Weary's in jail.

40:34.992 --> 40:36.253
They're gonna gas him.

40:36.279 --> 40:38.048
A book is not gonna change that.

40:40.403 --> 40:43.283
Do you still think he's innocent?

40:43.323 --> 40:44.492
Your testimony put him away.

40:44.518 --> 40:46.163
It doesn't really matter what I think.

40:46.203 --> 40:49.045
During the trial, you did all those stories about me.

40:49.071 --> 40:50.203
You called me a liar.

40:50.203 --> 40:52.463
I think you falsely identified him, yes.

40:52.503 --> 40:56.043
- Have you talked to Cotton?
- Many times.

40:56.043 --> 40:58.093
And has his story changed?

40:58.093 --> 41:00.093
Not one word.

41:00.093 --> 41:02.723
He admits to having sex with your mother, but that's all.

41:02.723 --> 41:05.053
He's lying.
She never would've touched him.

41:05.053 --> 41:07.513
He raped her, and then he...

41:07.553 --> 41:08.526
He butchered her.

41:08.552 --> 41:10.473
Her blood was all over his coat.

41:10.523 --> 41:12.483
He was drunk that night.

41:12.523 --> 41:15.273
He left his coat at your house after your mother seduced him.

41:15.313 --> 41:16.789
I saw him leave wearing it.

41:16.815 --> 41:19.523
No, you saw someone leave wearing that coat.

41:19.573 --> 41:25.203
The same someone who planted it in Cotton's car, framing him.

41:25.243 --> 41:29.413
No. Cotton murdered my mother.

41:31.583 --> 41:34.163
You're not so sure anymore, are you?

41:35.673 --> 41:37.774
Nice welt, sweetie.

41:37.800 --> 41:39.543
Let's go, Sid.

41:39.593 --> 41:41.553
The killer's still on the loose, isn't he?

41:41.593 --> 41:44.013
- Come on, Sid.
- Those murders are related.

41:44.053 --> 41:46.883
I'm sorry I mangled your face.

41:46.933 --> 41:50.053
- Sidney, don't go!
- Just stop, all right?

41:55.563 --> 41:57.523
Jesus Christ!

41:57.563 --> 41:59.141
An innocent man on death row.

41:59.167 --> 42:00.773
A killer still on the loose.

42:00.773 --> 42:02.302
Kenny, tell me I'm dreaming.

42:02.328 --> 42:03.613
You wanna go live?

42:03.613 --> 42:05.635
Not so fast. We don't have anything concrete.

42:05.661 --> 42:06.953
You can't just sit on it.

42:06.953 --> 42:10.123
I know!
That's why we need proof.

42:10.123 --> 42:14.253
If I'm right about this, I could save a man's life.

42:14.293 --> 42:17.673
Do you know what that could do for my book sales?

42:17.713 --> 42:18.838
This is a mistake.

42:18.864 --> 42:20.213
I shouldn't be here.

42:20.253 --> 42:24.593
I want you to meet me right here after class, okay, Sid?

42:24.633 --> 42:26.973
All right.

42:26.973 --> 42:29.799
Hey, I haven't seen Billy around.

42:29.825 --> 42:31.683
Is he really pissed?

42:31.723 --> 42:33.893
Oh, you mean after you branded him the Candyman?

42:33.933 --> 42:35.933
- No, his heart's broken. Ow!
- Stu!

42:45.073 --> 42:47.033
Why are they doing this?

42:47.073 --> 42:48.113
Are you kidding me?

42:48.139 --> 42:50.413
Look at this place.
It's like Christmas.

42:50.453 --> 42:53.533
- Stupidity leak.
- Ow. Easy.

42:53.583 --> 42:56.373
Sidney!

42:56.413 --> 42:58.503
- Ow!
- Jesus, shit!

42:58.543 --> 43:01.333
It's just me.

43:01.383 --> 43:04.923
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You still think it's me.

43:04.963 --> 43:07.423
No. No, I-I don't.

43:07.473 --> 43:10.933
It's just...
somebody was there.

43:10.973 --> 43:13.013
Billy, someone tried to kill me.

43:13.013 --> 43:15.903
I know, I know.
The cops said I scared him away.

43:15.929 --> 43:17.023
It wasn't me, Sid.

43:17.023 --> 43:21.483
I know.
He called me again last night at Tatum's house.

43:21.523 --> 43:23.454
You see?
 It couldn't have been me.

43:23.480 --> 43:24.363
I was in jail.

43:24.363 --> 43:26.363
Remember?

43:27.693 --> 43:29.253
I'm so... sorry.

43:29.279 --> 43:31.203
Please understand.

43:31.203 --> 43:33.203
Understand what?

43:33.203 --> 43:35.793
That I have a girlfriend who would rather accuse me...

43:35.833 --> 43:38.583
of being a psychopathic killer than touch me?

43:38.623 --> 43:41.793
You know that's not true.

43:41.833 --> 43:44.633
- Then what is it?
- What... is it?

43:44.673 --> 43:47.513
Billy, I was attacked and nearly filleted last night!

43:47.553 --> 43:49.513
I mean between us.

43:49.553 --> 43:52.393
You haven't been the same since...

43:53.893 --> 43:55.133
Since your mother died.

43:55.159 --> 43:56.643
Is your brain leaking?

43:56.683 --> 43:57.448
My mom was killed.

43:57.474 --> 43:59.233
I can't believe you're bringing this up!

43:59.233 --> 44:00.663
It's been a year.

44:00.689 --> 44:03.523
Tomorrow!
 One year tomorrow.

44:03.563 --> 44:05.523
I think it's time you got over that.

44:05.563 --> 44:07.664
When my mom left my dad, I accepted it.

44:07.690 --> 44:08.903
That's the way it is.

44:08.903 --> 44:10.863
She's not coming back.

44:10.903 --> 44:12.253
Your parents split up.

44:12.279 --> 44:14.033
This is not the same thing.

44:14.073 --> 44:15.042
Your mom left town.

44:15.068 --> 44:17.083
She's not lying in a coffin somewhere.

44:17.083 --> 44:18.659
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

44:18.685 --> 44:20.163
It's a bad analogy.

44:20.203 --> 44:22.503
It's just that...

44:22.543 --> 44:25.583
I want my girlfriend back.

44:27.843 --> 44:29.803
Sid!

44:29.843 --> 44:31.803
Billy, I am sorry if my traumatized life...

44:31.843 --> 44:34.803
is an inconvenience to you and your perfect existence.

44:34.843 --> 44:38.063
What? Wh...
Nobody said that. Sid!

44:39.773 --> 44:41.733
Stupid.

44:41.773 --> 44:43.943
You make me so sick!

44:43.983 --> 44:48.483
Your entire havoc-inducing, thieving, whoring generation disgusts me!

44:48.523 --> 44:52.993
So, two of your fellow students...

44:53.033 --> 44:55.283
just savagely murdered...

44:55.283 --> 44:58.583
and this is the way you show your compassion and sensitivity, huh?

44:58.623 --> 45:00.138
Let me tell you something.

45:00.164 --> 45:02.003
You're both expelled! Get out!

45:02.043 --> 45:03.648
Come on, Mr. Himbry!

45:03.674 --> 45:05.333
It was just a joke.

45:05.373 --> 45:07.333
That's not fair!

45:10.463 --> 45:12.049
You're absolutely right.

45:12.075 --> 45:13.173
It is not fair.

45:13.223 --> 45:15.593
Fairness would be to rip your insides out...

45:15.633 --> 45:17.803
hang you from a tree so we can expose you...

45:17.803 --> 45:20.853
for the heartless, desensitized little shits that you are.

45:32.903 --> 45:34.212
She was never attacked.

45:34.238 --> 45:35.863
I think she made it all up.

45:35.913 --> 45:38.203
- Why would she lie about it?
- For attention!

45:38.243 --> 45:40.533
The girl has some serious issues.

45:46.623 --> 45:48.583
What if she did it?

45:48.633 --> 45:51.133
What if Sidney killed Casey and Steve?

45:51.173 --> 45:53.133
Why would she do that?

45:53.173 --> 45:56.513
Maybe she had the hots for Steve and killed them both in a jealous rage.

45:56.513 --> 45:58.810
What would Sidney want with Steve?

45:58.836 --> 46:01.513
She has her own bubble-butt boyfriend.

46:01.513 --> 46:04.983
Maybe she's a slut just like her mother.

46:05.023 --> 46:08.353
- You're evil.
- Please, it's a common fact.

46:08.353 --> 46:10.586
- Her mother was a tramp.
- Cut some slack.

46:10.612 --> 46:12.363
She watched her mom get butchered.

46:12.363 --> 46:13.807
And it fucked her up royally.

46:13.833 --> 46:14.653
Think about it.

46:14.693 --> 46:17.323
Her mother's death leaves her disturbed and hostile.

46:17.363 --> 46:20.953
In a cruel and inhumane world, she's delusional.

46:20.993 --> 46:22.526
Where is God?
 Etcetera.

46:22.552 --> 46:23.993
Completely suicidal.

46:24.043 --> 46:25.089
One day she snaps.

46:25.115 --> 46:26.833
She wants to kill herself...

46:26.873 --> 46:30.333
but she realizes that teen suicide is out this year...

46:30.383 --> 46:34.343
and homicide is a much healthier, therapeutic expression.

46:34.383 --> 46:37.343
- Where do you get this shit?
- Ricki Lake.

46:37.383 --> 46:40.553
You are pathetic.

46:53.403 --> 46:55.943
Pathetic.

47:22.933 --> 47:25.183
Sidney.

47:29.773 --> 47:31.733
Is someone there?

48:11.353 --> 48:13.353
In what appears to be a prank...

48:13.353 --> 48:16.073
several students were seen wearing scary masks.

48:16.113 --> 48:18.073
School officials have yet to comment...

48:18.113 --> 48:22.033
but this is known to be the same costume worn by the killer.

48:22.033 --> 48:26.203
Seventeen-year-old Casey Becker and her boyfriend
Steven Orth have already lost their lives.

48:26.243 --> 48:28.203
Who's next?

48:28.243 --> 48:32.123
You can literally feel the fear on this campus.

48:32.163 --> 48:35.253
Hi! Gale Weathers, field correspondent, "Top Story."

48:35.293 --> 48:37.253
I know who you are, Miss Weathers.

48:37.293 --> 48:39.709
- How's the eye?
- It's productive.

48:39.735 --> 48:41.723
Is there a problem on campus?

48:41.763 --> 48:43.723
No, everything's under control.

48:43.763 --> 48:45.170
Of course. You're here.

48:45.196 --> 48:47.433
You're not supposed to be here.

48:47.473 --> 48:50.523
I know. I should be in New York covering the Sharon Stone stalker...

48:50.563 --> 48:52.563
but who knew?

48:52.563 --> 48:55.103
You look awfully young to be a police officer.

48:55.153 --> 48:57.773
I'm 25 years old.

48:57.823 --> 48:59.783
You know, in a demographic study...

48:59.823 --> 49:03.243
I proved to be most popular amongst males 11 to 24.

49:03.283 --> 49:04.919
Guess I just missed you.

49:04.945 --> 49:07.783
Of course, you don't look a day over 12.

49:07.833 --> 49:10.203
Except in that upper torso area.

49:10.203 --> 49:13.583
- Does the force require you to work out?
- No, ma'am.

49:13.623 --> 49:15.583
'Cause of my boyish good looks...

49:15.623 --> 49:19.463
muscle mass has increased my acceptance as a serious police officer.

49:19.503 --> 49:22.173
I need your attention now, kids.

49:22.213 --> 49:24.303
Due to the recent events that have occurred...

49:24.343 --> 49:28.393
effective immediately, all classes are suspended until further notice.

49:28.393 --> 49:33.023
- The Woodsboro police department has issued a citywide curfew...

49:33.063 --> 49:36.853
beginning at 9:00 tonight.

49:36.903 --> 49:38.863
Looks like we've got a serial killer on our hands.

49:38.903 --> 49:40.903
Serial killer's not really accurate.

49:40.903 --> 49:43.783
Gotta knock off a couple more to get that title.

49:43.823 --> 49:46.913
Well, we can hope, can't we?

49:46.913 --> 49:50.083
I mean, we certainly don't have any leads.

49:50.083 --> 49:53.253
- Have you located Sidney's father yet?
- No, not yet.

49:53.253 --> 49:55.184
- He's not a suspect, is he?

49:55.210 --> 49:58.633
- We haven't ruled him out as a...
possibility.

49:58.673 --> 49:59.984
If you'll excuse me.

50:00.010 --> 50:02.213
I'm sorry. Am I keeping you?

50:02.253 --> 50:06.053
If I may say so,
Miss Weathers...

50:06.093 --> 50:09.643
you are much prettier in person.

50:09.683 --> 50:11.893
So you do watch the show.

50:13.473 --> 50:14.509
I'm 25.

50:14.535 --> 50:18.653
I was 24 for a whole year.

50:18.693 --> 50:22.023
Please, call me Gale!

50:22.073 --> 50:24.443
It was just some sick fuck having a laugh, Sidney.

50:24.443 --> 50:26.743
No, it was him, Tatum.
I know it.

50:26.783 --> 50:28.674
You're not to pee alone anymore.

50:28.700 --> 50:30.743
If you pee, I pee.
 Is that clear?

50:30.783 --> 50:33.413
"Kizzo-kaskizzo is is-out."

50:33.453 --> 50:35.413
I don't know what you did, Sidney.

50:35.453 --> 50:37.583
But on behalf of the entire student body,
we all say, "Thank you!"

50:37.623 --> 50:40.083
- Drop it, Stu.
- I say...

50:40.133 --> 50:42.923
an impromptu party tonight, my house.

50:42.963 --> 50:44.172
Celebrate this little siesta.

50:44.198 --> 50:44.923
What do you say?

50:44.963 --> 50:46.923
Are you serious?

50:46.973 --> 50:48.933
This little vixen...

50:48.973 --> 50:51.303
doesn't invite the entire world, we'll be fine.

50:51.303 --> 50:53.813
Intimate gathering, intimate friends.

50:53.813 --> 50:55.813
What do you say, Sid?

50:55.813 --> 50:57.813
I mean, pathos could have its perks.

50:57.813 --> 50:59.029
Totally protected.

50:59.055 --> 51:00.313
Yo, I am so buff.

51:00.313 --> 51:02.443
I got you covered, girl.

51:02.483 --> 51:04.615
Come on, Sid. For me?

51:04.641 --> 51:06.468
It could be fun.

51:07.403 --> 51:09.743
Okay. Whatever.

51:09.783 --> 51:11.743
Yeah? Nice.

51:11.783 --> 51:13.743
Cool. You guys bring food, all right?

51:31.683 --> 51:33.683
Yes?

51:33.683 --> 51:35.683
Hello?

52:10.133 --> 52:11.356
Damn little shits.

52:11.382 --> 52:13.393
What'd you call me? Huh?

52:13.433 --> 52:16.223
- Not you, Fred.
- You prick.

53:06.773 --> 53:08.503
Aaaah!

53:08.529 --> 53:10.233
Aaah!

53:10.283 --> 53:12.443
Ohhhhh!

53:22.293 --> 53:26.503
School's out for summer

53:29.043 --> 53:32.013
- School's out
- What if Cotton Weary is telling the truth?

53:32.053 --> 53:35.303
Maybe he was having an affair with your mom.

53:35.303 --> 53:39.433
I mean, your dad was always out of town on business. Maybe...

53:39.473 --> 53:42.603
Maybe your mom was just a very unhappy woman.

53:42.643 --> 53:46.653
If they were having an affair, how come Cotton couldn't prove it in court?

53:46.693 --> 53:49.286
Well, you can't prove a rumor.

53:49.312 --> 53:51.533
That's why it's a rumor.

53:51.573 --> 53:55.653
Right.
Created by that little tabloid twit Gale Weathers.

53:56.993 --> 53:59.623
It goes further back, Sid.

53:59.663 --> 54:02.623
There's been talk about other men.

54:02.663 --> 54:05.163
And you believe it.

54:05.213 --> 54:11.043
Well, you can only hear that Richard Gere gerbil story so many times...

54:11.093 --> 54:14.053
before you have to start believing it.

54:17.843 --> 54:20.013
Oh, I'm sorry.

54:22.513 --> 54:25.523
Y-You know, if I was wrong about Cotton Weary...

54:25.523 --> 54:27.523
then... the killer's still out there.

54:27.523 --> 54:29.523
Don't go there, Sid.

54:29.523 --> 54:32.693
You're starting to sound like some Wes Carpenter flick or something.

54:32.733 --> 54:34.280
Don't freak yourself, okay?

54:34.306 --> 54:36.768
We've got a long night ahead of us.
Okay?

54:37.743 --> 54:39.743
Let's boogie.

54:43.373 --> 54:45.333
It's alive!

54:45.373 --> 54:49.333
- Henry...
- Oh, in the name of God, now I know...

54:49.373 --> 54:51.343
Excuse me, dude.

54:53.053 --> 54:55.053
- Watch it, jerk.
- I'm sorry.

54:57.383 --> 54:59.383
Ohhhh!

54:59.383 --> 55:01.803
Dork.

55:01.853 --> 55:04.813
Jesus, this place is packed tonight, man.

55:04.853 --> 55:07.002
We had a run in the mass murder section.

55:07.028 --> 55:08.313
Comin' to my fiesta?

55:08.353 --> 55:10.903
Yeah, I'm off early.
Curfew, you know.

55:10.943 --> 55:13.943
What's that werewolf movie with E.T.'s mom in it?

55:13.943 --> 55:17.073
- "The Howling." Horror. Straight ahead.
- Okay, thanks.

55:18.573 --> 55:22.243
- Oh, now that's in poor taste.
- What?

55:22.283 --> 55:26.293
If you were the only suspect in a senseless bloodbath...

55:26.293 --> 55:29.293
would you be standing in the horror section?

55:29.293 --> 55:31.695
What? It was just a misunderstanding.

55:31.721 --> 55:33.253
He didn't do anything.

55:33.253 --> 55:35.253
You're such a little lapdog.

55:35.253 --> 55:38.763
- He's got "killer" printed all over his forehead.
- Ohhh-kay!

55:38.803 --> 55:42.553
Really?
Well, why'd the cops let him go, smart guy?

55:42.593 --> 55:44.789
Obviously they don't watch enough movies.

55:44.815 --> 55:46.723
This is standard horror movie stuff.

55:46.773 --> 55:48.348
"Prom Night" revisited, man.

55:48.374 --> 55:51.443
Yeah? Why would he wanna kill his own girlfriend?

55:51.443 --> 55:54.563
There's always some stupid, bullshit reason to kill your girlfriend.

55:54.613 --> 55:58.193
- Oh?
- That's the beauty of it all: Simplicity.

55:58.243 --> 56:01.953
Besides, if it gets too complicated, you lose your target audience.

56:01.953 --> 56:04.073
Well, what's his reason?

56:04.123 --> 56:06.623
Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.

56:06.623 --> 56:10.163
- What, is she savin' herself for you?
- Maybe.

56:10.213 --> 56:14.923
Now that Billy tried to mutilate her,
do you think Sid would go out with me?

56:20.383 --> 56:22.803
No, I don't at all. No.

56:22.803 --> 56:26.223
You know who I think it is?

56:26.263 --> 56:28.933
You know, I think it's her father.

56:28.973 --> 56:31.443
Why can't they find her pops, man?

56:31.483 --> 56:33.603
Because he's probably dead.

56:33.653 --> 56:37.233
His body will come poppin' up in the last reel somewhere!

56:37.273 --> 56:41.193
Eyes gouged out, fingers cut off, teeth knocked out!

56:41.243 --> 56:43.993
- The police are always off track with this shit.
- Man!

56:44.033 --> 56:46.533
If they'd watch "Prom Night," they'd save time.

56:46.533 --> 56:49.244
There's a formula to it.
A very simple formula!

56:49.270 --> 56:50.568
Everybody's a suspect!

56:54.833 --> 56:58.310
I'm telling you, the dad's a red herring.

56:58.336 --> 56:59.328
It's Billy.

57:00.843 --> 57:03.803
How do we know you're not the killer?
Huh?

57:03.843 --> 57:06.393
- Huh?
- Hi, Billy.

57:06.433 --> 57:08.814
Maybe your movie-freaked mind lost its reality button.

57:08.840 --> 57:09.853
You ever think of that?

57:09.853 --> 57:11.238
You're absolutely right.

57:11.264 --> 57:12.853
I'm the first to admit it.

57:12.853 --> 57:16.353
- If this were a scary movie, I'd be the prime suspect.
- That's right.

57:16.353 --> 57:18.363
And what would be your motive?

57:18.363 --> 57:20.573
It's the millennium.

57:20.613 --> 57:22.573
Motives are incidental.

57:22.613 --> 57:24.653
"Millennium." Hmm.

57:24.703 --> 57:26.579
"Millennium." I like that.

57:26.605 --> 57:29.058
That's good.
It's the millennium.

57:30.083 --> 57:32.083
Good kid.

57:33.163 --> 57:34.412
"Millennium."

57:34.438 --> 57:36.333
Good word, my man.

57:36.373 --> 57:38.383
Are you telling me that's not a killer?

57:41.173 --> 57:43.883
You'll see him in your nightmares

57:43.883 --> 57:46.723
You'll see him in your dreams

57:49.723 --> 57:52.523
He'll appear out of nowhere

57:52.563 --> 57:54.853
But he ain't

57:54.893 --> 57:57.563
What he seems

57:57.603 --> 58:00.323
You'll see him in your head

58:00.363 --> 58:02.363
On the TV screen

58:02.403 --> 58:06.073
Hey, buddy, I'm warnin' you to turn it off

58:06.113 --> 58:08.533
Ah, he's a ghost He's a god

58:08.573 --> 58:11.743
He's a man He's a guru

58:13.253 --> 58:18.083
You're one microscopic cog in his catastrophic plan

58:18.083 --> 58:22.053
Designed and directed by his red right hand

58:23.093 --> 58:25.053
Sure is quiet.

58:25.093 --> 58:27.053
God, look at this place.

58:27.093 --> 58:29.473
It's "The Town That Dreaded Sundown."

58:29.513 --> 58:30.862
Yeah, I saw that movie.

58:30.888 --> 58:32.973
It's about a killer in Texas, huh?

58:33.013 --> 58:34.983
- Mmm.
- Hey, Sid, just think.

58:35.023 --> 58:37.983
If they make a movie about you, who's gonna play you?

58:38.023 --> 58:39.135
I shudder to think.

58:39.161 --> 58:41.653
I see you as a young Meg Ryan myself.

58:41.693 --> 58:45.153
Thanks, Dewey.
With my luck, they'd cast Tori Spelling.

58:45.193 --> 58:48.153
I'm just gonna be a few minutes.

58:48.203 --> 58:50.163
You girls don't go too far.

58:52.623 --> 58:54.623
Is Billy gonna be there tonight?

58:54.623 --> 58:55.704
He'd better not be.

58:55.730 --> 58:57.753
I told Stu to keep his mouth shut.

58:57.793 --> 59:00.753
I think we can live without the endorphin rush for one night.

59:02.383 --> 59:03.604
Billy's right, you know.

59:03.630 --> 59:05.843
Whenever he touches me, I just can't relax.

59:05.883 --> 59:09.513
So you have a few intimacy issues as a
result of your mother's untimely death.

59:09.553 --> 59:10.862
That's no big deal.

59:10.888 --> 59:12.103
You'll thaw out.

59:12.143 --> 59:15.603
Yeah, but he has been so patient with me with all the sex stuff.

59:15.643 --> 59:19.313
How many guys would put up with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?

59:19.353 --> 59:22.363
Billy and his penis don't deserve you, all right?

59:30.743 --> 59:32.703
Dewey, where the hell you been?

59:32.743 --> 59:35.703
I was keepin' an eye on Sidney, uh...

59:37.003 --> 59:38.807
Thought you quit.

59:38.833 --> 59:41.673
I did. But damn it...

59:41.673 --> 59:45.003
Dewey, Vital Phone just faxed us.

59:45.053 --> 59:49.513
Those calls are listed to Neil Prescott, Sidney's father.

59:49.513 --> 59:51.940
He made the calls with a cellular phone.

59:51.966 --> 59:53.208
It's been confirmed.

59:54.433 --> 59:57.393
There's no way a cellular coulda been cloned?

59:57.433 --> 01:00:00.233
There's more.
Guess what tomorrow is.

01:00:00.273 --> 01:00:02.853
The anniversary of his wife's death.

01:00:05.693 --> 01:00:08.693
We'll keep the roadblocks and the curfew in effect through the night.

01:00:08.693 --> 01:00:12.033
If he's not picked up by morning, then we'll do a house-to-house.

01:00:13.163 --> 01:00:15.123
- Where's Sidney?
- She's with my sister.

01:00:15.163 --> 01:00:18.703
- You want me to bring her in?
- Naw.

01:00:18.753 --> 01:00:20.753
Not just yet.

01:00:20.753 --> 01:00:24.253
Let's find Neil first, make sure he's our man.

Don't let her out of your sight.

God bless the youth of America

01:01:11.263 --> 01:01:13.803
I can't stand their sight anymore

01:01:13.843 --> 01:01:16.093
- All right, you girls have fun.

01:01:16.143 --> 01:01:19.143
Not too much fun, or I'll bust ya.

01:01:20.353 --> 01:01:22.313
- Bye.
- Bye, Sid.

01:01:24.313 --> 01:01:30.733
You're obsessed

01:01:30.783 --> 01:01:35.033
You're obsessed

01:01:35.073 --> 01:01:37.033
- Here, kids!

01:01:39.413 --> 01:01:41.373
Oh! That's absurd.

01:01:41.413 --> 01:01:44.373
You guys were tardy for the party, so we started without you.

01:01:44.413 --> 01:01:46.423
- My man!

01:02:01.103 --> 01:02:03.063
Shh.

01:02:04.233 --> 01:02:06.193
Were we spotted?

01:02:06.233 --> 01:02:07.593
I don't think so.

01:02:07.619 --> 01:02:09.218
Go get the camera.

01:02:11.693 --> 01:02:14.073
- I'm sorry.
 I didn't mean to scare ya.

01:02:14.113 --> 01:02:15.239
Deputy, that's okay.

01:02:15.265 --> 01:02:17.323
What brings you to these parts?

01:02:17.363 --> 01:02:21.533
Well, you just never know when or where a story will break.

01:02:21.583 --> 01:02:23.152
Not much of a story here.

01:02:23.178 --> 01:02:25.663
Just a bunch of kids cuttin' it loose.

01:02:25.713 --> 01:02:28.503
Then what are you doing here?

01:02:31.043 --> 01:02:33.553
Just keepin' an eye on things.

01:02:33.553 --> 01:02:36.553
I'm gonna check the party out.

01:02:36.553 --> 01:02:40.053
- Do you mind if I join you?
- Not at all.

01:02:41.053 --> 01:02:44.393
Let me just get my coat.
Thanks.

01:02:49.563 --> 01:02:52.573
- All right.
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:02:52.613 --> 01:02:54.573
Oh! Yeah.

01:02:56.693 --> 01:02:59.703
- How many "Evil Deads"?
- One! Two!

01:02:59.703 --> 01:03:00.754
How many "Hellraisers"?

01:03:00.780 --> 01:03:02.033
Hellraiser right here.

01:03:02.083 --> 01:03:05.583
"The Fog," "Terror Train," "Prom Night."

01:03:05.583 --> 01:03:09.083
How come Jamie Lee Curtis is in all of these movies?

01:03:09.083 --> 01:03:11.673
She's the... scream queen.

01:03:11.713 --> 01:03:14.923
- With a set of lungs like that, she should be.
- Yeah.

01:03:14.963 --> 01:03:16.553
Tits. See?

01:03:16.593 --> 01:03:18.593
- Oh, I'll get it.

01:03:20.093 --> 01:03:22.603
Hey, Tate, grab another beer, would ya?

01:03:22.603 --> 01:03:25.063
- There's more beer in the garage.

01:03:25.063 --> 01:03:27.063
What am I, the beer wench?

01:03:27.063 --> 01:03:30.063
- She was nominated for "Terror Train."
- Oh, yeah?

01:03:30.063 --> 01:03:31.605
You are not gonna believe who's here!

01:03:31.631 --> 01:03:33.063
It's that chick from "Top Story"!

01:03:33.063 --> 01:03:35.023
- Gale Weathers?
- Here. Yeah.

01:03:37.903 --> 01:03:39.903
You're under age, son.

01:03:39.903 --> 01:03:41.913
I'm kiddin'.
Have a good time.

01:03:41.913 --> 01:03:43.743
- Dewey.
- Hi.

01:03:43.783 --> 01:03:46.913
Dewey.

01:03:46.913 --> 01:03:48.609
What is she doing here?

01:03:48.635 --> 01:03:50.083
She's with me!

01:03:50.083 --> 01:03:52.543
- I'm just checkin' things out.
- So you did.

01:03:52.583 --> 01:03:56.963
Now leave, and take your media mouth with you.

01:03:58.423 --> 01:03:59.794
I just think you're awesome.

01:03:59.820 --> 01:04:01.263
Oh, thank you very much.

01:04:01.263 --> 01:04:03.263
- I watch your show religiously.
- That's great.

01:04:03.263 --> 01:04:05.723
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:04:05.763 --> 01:04:08.393
- I need a camera.

01:04:08.433 --> 01:04:10.226
Have you found my father?

01:04:10.252 --> 01:04:11.758
I'm afraid not.

01:04:13.443 --> 01:04:15.943
- Should I be worried?
- Not yet.

01:04:17.983 --> 01:04:19.348
- Get out, you're walkin'

01:04:19.374 --> 01:04:21.533
- That's the one I want..."Halloween."

01:04:21.573 --> 01:04:25.073
- Too bad, I've spoken

01:04:25.123 --> 01:04:27.743
When I look at you you're forgiven

01:04:42.053 --> 01:04:44.143
Mmm.

01:04:44.143 --> 01:04:46.183
You're forgiven

01:05:05.033 --> 01:05:07.703
- Jesus!

01:05:10.043 --> 01:05:12.663
Tatum, it's okay.

01:05:22.423 --> 01:05:24.383
Shit.

01:05:28.853 --> 01:05:30.853
Hey, shitheads!

01:05:32.353 --> 01:05:34.353
Hello!

01:05:35.653 --> 01:05:38.653
Shit. Piss.

01:05:55.873 --> 01:05:57.543
Is that you, Randy?

01:06:00.093 --> 01:06:01.968
Cute. What movie is this from?

01:06:01.994 --> 01:06:03.618
"I Spit On Your Garage"?

01:06:05.553 --> 01:06:06.644
Lose the outfit.

01:06:06.670 --> 01:06:08.893
If Sidney sees it, she'll flip.

01:06:08.933 --> 01:06:11.933
Oh, you wanna play psycho killer?

01:06:11.933 --> 01:06:14.683
Can I be the helpless victim?

01:06:14.733 --> 01:06:18.193
Okay, let's see...
No, please don't kill me, Mr. Ghost Face.

01:06:18.233 --> 01:06:20.773
I wanna be in the sequel!

01:06:22.113 --> 01:06:23.523
Cut, Casper.

01:06:23.549 --> 01:06:25.428
That's a wrap.

01:06:27.243 --> 01:06:30.623
Randy, what the hell are you doing? Aaah!

01:06:32.833 --> 01:06:34.953
Aaah! Stop!

01:06:41.923 --> 01:06:43.763
Aaaah!

01:06:49.933 --> 01:06:52.603
Fucker!

01:06:52.603 --> 01:06:54.773
Aaah!

01:07:12.833 --> 01:07:17.543
- Aaah!

01:07:17.569 --> 01:07:22.253
Aaaah!

01:07:22.293 --> 01:07:25.633
Aaaaah!

01:07:25.633 --> 01:07:29.093
No! No!

01:07:45.653 --> 01:07:48.743
- Happy curfew.
- Nice party, Stu.

01:07:48.783 --> 01:07:49.562
Tatum, come on!

01:07:49.588 --> 01:07:51.743
There's nobody here but us chickens!

01:07:51.783 --> 01:07:53.172
Do you know where she is?

01:07:53.198 --> 01:07:54.783
No, I haven't seen her.

01:07:54.833 --> 01:07:56.703
- Aaah!

01:07:56.743 --> 01:07:59.333
Oh. Billy. Hey.

01:07:59.373 --> 01:08:01.373
Billy. Hmm.
What are you doin' here?

01:08:01.373 --> 01:08:04.213
I was hoping I could talk to Sid alone.

01:08:04.253 --> 01:08:07.463
You know, if Tatum sees you here, she'll draw blood.

01:08:07.513 --> 01:08:10.473
Why don't you go up to my parents' room?

01:08:10.513 --> 01:08:13.973
You know, you guys can talk, whatever.

01:08:14.013 --> 01:08:16.473
Subtlety, Stu.
You should look it up.

01:08:17.563 --> 01:08:20.563
No, i-it's okay.
We do need to talk.

01:08:22.853 --> 01:08:24.863
Oooh! Oww.

01:08:30.033 --> 01:08:31.993
What's Leatherface doin' here?

01:08:32.033 --> 01:08:34.662
Cute. He came to make up.

01:08:34.703 --> 01:08:37.662
There goes my chance with Sid.
Damn it.

01:08:37.703 --> 01:08:39.832
As if. That's all I'm sayin'.

01:08:39.872 --> 01:08:41.832
As if.

01:08:41.872 --> 01:08:43.832
Oh, really, Alicia?

01:08:44.883 --> 01:08:47.752
"As if."
I'm gonna go check on them.

01:08:47.803 --> 01:08:50.843
- Come on!
- It was nice to meet all of you.

01:08:54.093 --> 01:08:56.393
You're a genius.

01:08:56.433 --> 01:08:58.723
- Oh, shit.
- What?

01:08:58.763 --> 01:09:01.273
- I got a delay.
- How long is it?

01:09:01.273 --> 01:09:02.073
I don't know.

01:09:02.099 --> 01:09:05.273
What'd it take you to walk from the house, 30 seconds?

01:09:05.273 --> 01:09:06.993
Lt'll be fine. Just record it.

01:09:07.020 --> 01:09:08.773
Oh, the placement is perfect.

01:09:08.773 --> 01:09:10.283
- Tell me, Kenneth...
- Hmm?

01:09:10.283 --> 01:09:13.783
Has a cheesy tabloid journalist ever won the Pulitzer?

01:09:13.783 --> 01:09:16.033
Well, first time for everything.

01:09:16.073 --> 01:09:18.033
You're damn right.

01:09:24.582 --> 01:09:26.542
S-So, um...

01:09:28.593 --> 01:09:30.553
- So...

01:09:33.473 --> 01:09:35.473
I'm sorry.

01:09:36.593 --> 01:09:40.563
I've been selfish, and I want to apologize.

01:09:40.603 --> 01:09:43.773
No, Billy, I-I'm...

01:09:43.813 --> 01:09:47.443
the one who's been selfish and self-absorbed...

01:09:47.443 --> 01:09:50.273
with all this post-traumatic stress.

01:09:51.613 --> 01:09:52.921
You lost your mom.

01:09:52.948 --> 01:09:55.613
Yeah, I know, but you're right.

01:09:55.663 --> 01:09:57.663
Enough is enough.

01:09:57.663 --> 01:10:00.663
I can't wallow in the grief process forever...

01:10:00.663 --> 01:10:02.663
and...

01:10:04.163 --> 01:10:06.173
and I can't...

01:10:06.173 --> 01:10:10.463
keep lying to myself about who my mom was.

01:10:14.223 --> 01:10:16.013
Yeah, I think I'm really...

01:10:18.553 --> 01:10:20.853
scared...

01:10:20.893 --> 01:10:24.353
that I'm gonna turn out just like her, you know?

01:10:25.483 --> 01:10:28.983
Like "The Bad Seed" or somethin'.

01:10:29.023 --> 01:10:32.023
And I know it doesn't make sense.

01:10:33.153 --> 01:10:35.113
Yeah, it does.

01:10:36.993 --> 01:10:38.993
Hmm.

01:10:38.993 --> 01:10:42.493
It's like Jodie Foster in "The Silence of the Lambs"...

01:10:42.493 --> 01:10:46.503
when she keeps having flashbacks of her dead father.

01:10:46.503 --> 01:10:48.673
But this is life.

01:10:48.673 --> 01:10:50.673
This isn't a movie.

01:10:50.673 --> 01:10:53.253
Sure it is, Sid.

01:10:53.303 --> 01:10:55.263
It's all...
It's all a movie.

01:10:55.303 --> 01:10:57.263
It's all...

01:10:57.303 --> 01:10:59.263
one great big movie.

01:11:05.733 --> 01:11:08.233
Only you can't pick your genre.

01:11:34.173 --> 01:11:37.213
Why can't I be a Meg Ryan movie?

01:11:40.223 --> 01:11:43.263
Or even a good porno.

01:11:45.773 --> 01:11:47.773
What?

01:11:47.773 --> 01:11:49.773
You heard me.

01:11:57.743 --> 01:11:59.703
Are you sure?

01:12:01.743 --> 01:12:03.703
Yeah.

01:12:03.743 --> 01:12:05.703
I think so.

01:12:22.343 --> 01:12:24.603
Look, look, look.
Here it comes.

01:12:24.643 --> 01:12:26.643
- Whoa!
- Ohh!

01:12:26.643 --> 01:12:28.202
The blood is all wrong!

01:12:28.228 --> 01:12:30.643
Why do they do that?
It's too red!

01:12:30.643 --> 01:12:32.653
Wait. Here comes another.

01:12:34.523 --> 01:12:36.483
- Oooh! Oooh!
- Yes! Yes!

01:12:36.523 --> 01:12:38.983
Predictable.
I knew he was gonna bite it.

01:12:39.033 --> 01:12:41.993
- How can you watch this shit over and over?
- Shh!

01:12:42.033 --> 01:12:44.493
I wanna see Jamie Lee's breasts.

01:12:44.533 --> 01:12:46.993
- When do we see Jamie Lee's breasts?
- Breasts?

01:12:47.033 --> 01:12:49.453
Not until "Trading Places" in '83.

01:12:49.453 --> 01:12:51.963
Jamie Lee was always the virgin in horror movies.

01:12:51.963 --> 01:12:54.465
She never showed her tits 'til she went legits.

01:12:54.491 --> 01:12:56.133
Could afford a decent pair.

01:12:56.133 --> 01:13:00.593
That's why she always outsmarted the
killer in the big chase scene at the end.

01:13:00.633 --> 01:13:02.056
Only virgins can do that.

01:13:02.082 --> 01:13:03.593
Don't you know the rules?

01:13:03.633 --> 01:13:05.593
- What rules?
- You don't...

01:13:07.723 --> 01:13:10.273
Jesus Christ.
You don't know the rules?

01:13:10.313 --> 01:13:12.443
Have an aneurysm, why don't ya?

01:13:12.483 --> 01:13:15.443
There are certain rules one must abide by...

01:13:15.483 --> 01:13:18.363
in order to successfully survive a horror movie.

01:13:18.403 --> 01:13:21.443
For instance, number one: You can never have sex.

01:13:23.533 --> 01:13:25.823
Big no-no!
Big no-no!

01:13:25.873 --> 01:13:27.703
I'd be a dead man.

01:13:27.743 --> 01:13:29.703
Sex equals death. Okay?

01:13:29.743 --> 01:13:32.873
Number two: You can never drink or do drugs.

01:13:35.753 --> 01:13:37.713
No, the sin factor.

01:13:37.753 --> 01:13:40.713
It's a sin.
It's an extension of number one.

01:13:40.753 --> 01:13:44.513
And number three: Never, ever, ever under any circumstances, say...

01:13:44.513 --> 01:13:46.513
"I'll be right back," 'cause you won't be back.

01:13:46.513 --> 01:13:49.353
- I'm gettin' another beer. You want one?
- Yeah, sure.

01:13:49.353 --> 01:13:51.853
- I'll be right back!
- Ohhhh!

01:13:54.193 --> 01:13:56.108
You push the laws and you end up dead.

01:13:56.134 --> 01:13:58.023
See you in the kitchen with a knife.

01:13:58.063 --> 01:14:01.573
Only virgins can outsmart the killer in the big chase scene at the end.

01:14:01.573 --> 01:14:04.073
- Don't you know the rules?
- What rules?

01:14:04.113 --> 01:14:06.073
You don't know the rules?

01:14:06.113 --> 01:14:10.373
- There are rules one must abide by to survive a horror movie.
- Boring.

01:14:10.373 --> 01:14:12.373
- For instance...

01:14:13.583 --> 01:14:15.583
The sheriff just radioed.

01:14:15.583 --> 01:14:18.074
Somebody reported a car in the bushes down the road.

01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:19.343
I'm gonna go check it out.

01:14:19.383 --> 01:14:22.343
- Would you care to join me?
- I'd love to.

01:14:22.383 --> 01:14:24.553
If you're sure it's all right.

01:14:24.553 --> 01:14:28.433
Uh, ma'am, I'm the deputy of this town.

01:14:29.893 --> 01:14:31.893
Be right back.

01:14:33.353 --> 01:14:35.313
- Kids Shouting, Whooping]

01:14:35.353 --> 01:14:37.563
You push the laws, you end up dead.

01:14:37.603 --> 01:14:40.613
- W... Excuse me, ma'am.
- Mm-hmm?

01:14:40.613 --> 01:14:42.613
I thought maybe we'd walk.

01:14:43.823 --> 01:14:46.006
It's such a nice night out.

01:14:46.032 --> 01:14:47.728
I got a flashlight.

01:14:49.953 --> 01:14:52.283
You're not scared, are ya?

01:14:52.333 --> 01:14:54.293
No.

01:14:54.293 --> 01:14:56.873
- All right.
- Great.

01:15:00.633 --> 01:15:02.966
Do you know what that constellation is?

01:15:02.992 --> 01:15:04.133
No. What is it?

01:15:04.133 --> 01:15:05.580
- I don't know.

01:15:05.606 --> 01:15:08.498
That's why I was askin' you.

01:15:11.683 --> 01:15:13.643
What happened to Tatum, Stu?

01:15:13.683 --> 01:15:16.603
She probably got pissed at me and bailed. Bye.

01:15:18.603 --> 01:15:20.603
No, I'm just kidding.

01:15:37.123 --> 01:15:40.123
Look! Here comes the obligatory tit shot!

01:15:43.793 --> 01:15:45.753
- Yes! Oh! Beautiful!
- Lovely!

01:15:45.803 --> 01:15:47.763
Ohh! Ohh.

01:15:47.803 --> 01:15:48.496
Oh, my God.

01:15:48.522 --> 01:15:50.538
I'll leave you guys alone.

01:15:51.553 --> 01:15:53.513
You are so...

01:15:55.063 --> 01:15:57.023
amazing.

01:16:03.193 --> 01:16:05.943
- Hello? Yeah?

01:16:10.243 --> 01:16:12.203
Holy shit.

01:16:15.743 --> 01:16:17.663
Listen up.

01:16:17.663 --> 01:16:19.543
They found Principal Himbry dead.

01:16:19.583 --> 01:16:23.633
He was gutted and hung from the goalpost on the football field.

01:16:23.673 --> 01:16:25.026
What are we waiting for?

01:16:25.052 --> 01:16:28.013
Let's go over there before they bring him down.

01:16:28.013 --> 01:16:31.343
- Hey. Hey.
- To arms! To arms!

01:16:31.343 --> 01:16:32.732
Where did he say he was?

01:16:32.758 --> 01:16:34.353
At the football field!

01:16:34.353 --> 01:16:37.643
- Come on!
- Where you guys goin'?

01:16:37.683 --> 01:16:41.143
We were just gettin' to the good part.

01:16:41.193 --> 01:16:44.653
Hello? Yeah?

01:16:55.703 --> 01:16:57.993
- Whoo!

01:17:06.883 --> 01:17:10.013
Hi-ho, Silver! Let's go!

01:17:10.053 --> 01:17:13.223
So, is... is Dewey your real name?

01:17:13.223 --> 01:17:15.223
No, it's Dwight.

01:17:15.223 --> 01:17:17.223
Dwight?

01:17:17.223 --> 01:17:19.563
- I'm sorry.
- No, that's all right.

01:17:19.563 --> 01:17:23.393
Dewey's just somethin' I got stuck with a long time ago.

01:17:23.393 --> 01:17:25.903
Well, I like it.

01:17:25.903 --> 01:17:27.903
Sexy.

01:17:27.903 --> 01:17:30.653
- Sexy?
- Mm-hmm.

01:17:30.693 --> 01:17:34.153
Ah, it's just this town's way of not takin' me serious.

01:17:34.203 --> 01:17:36.663
What about Gale Weathers?

01:17:36.703 --> 01:17:39.833
Sounds like I'm a meteorologist or something.

01:17:41.043 --> 01:17:43.003
People treat me...

01:17:43.043 --> 01:17:45.463
like I'm the antichrist of television journalism.

01:17:45.503 --> 01:17:47.463
- I don't think you're that bad.
- No?

01:17:47.503 --> 01:17:49.463
- No? No.

01:17:49.503 --> 01:17:51.463
That's just 'cause you kinda like me.

01:17:51.513 --> 01:17:54.263
- They sure are comin' fast.
Slow down!

01:17:54.303 --> 01:17:58.053
- Freeze... Jump!

01:18:00.103 --> 01:18:02.063
I'm sorry.
Are you okay?

01:18:02.103 --> 01:18:04.063
Yeah.

01:18:15.783 --> 01:18:17.663
I'm sorry.

01:18:17.703 --> 01:18:19.663
I'm on duty.

01:18:27.003 --> 01:18:30.003
Is that what you're looking for?

01:18:30.003 --> 01:18:32.003
My whole life.

01:18:37.013 --> 01:18:39.013
- Damn!
- What?

01:18:39.013 --> 01:18:42.013
- What is it?
- This is Neil Prescott's car.

01:18:42.013 --> 01:18:44.023
- Sidney's father?
- Yeah.

01:18:45.313 --> 01:18:47.273
Jesus. What's he doing here?

01:18:48.693 --> 01:18:51.153
We gotta get back.

01:18:54.233 --> 01:18:56.203
You okay?

01:18:57.783 --> 01:18:59.743
Yeah.

01:18:59.783 --> 01:19:01.743
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:19:12.383 --> 01:19:14.553
Who'd you call?

01:19:14.593 --> 01:19:16.513
What?

01:19:16.513 --> 01:19:20.513
Um, well, I don't know, when you're arrested you're allowed one phone call.

01:19:20.513 --> 01:19:23.513
So I was just curious.
Who'd you call?

01:19:25.023 --> 01:19:26.983
Called my dad.

01:19:29.023 --> 01:19:32.653
No, um, Sheriff Burke called your dad.
I saw him.

01:19:34.733 --> 01:19:38.863
Yeah, but when I called I didn't get an answer.

01:19:43.373 --> 01:19:45.373
Huh.

01:19:49.873 --> 01:19:53.043
You don't still think it was me, do ya?

01:19:56.423 --> 01:19:58.423
No.

01:19:58.473 --> 01:20:00.433
No.

01:20:00.473 --> 01:20:05.603
I was just thinking, if it were you it'd be
a very clever way to throw me off track.

01:20:05.643 --> 01:20:10.353
You know, using your one phone call to
call me so I wouldn't think it was you.

01:20:10.393 --> 01:20:12.693
Really.

01:20:20.493 --> 01:20:25.083
What do I have to do to prove to you that I'm not a killer?

01:20:26.543 --> 01:20:29.253
- Oh, my God.
- Huh?

01:20:30.413 --> 01:20:32.793
- Oh, my God. - Sidney...
- Billy, watch out!

01:20:33.833 --> 01:20:35.253
- Aaah!
- Aaaah!

01:20:42.763 --> 01:20:44.933
Sid.

01:20:54.103 --> 01:20:55.903
No!

01:21:20.213 --> 01:21:23.513
- Shit!

01:21:29.183 --> 01:21:32.943
Help me, somebody! Help me!

01:21:51.543 --> 01:21:53.833
Help me!

01:22:23.243 --> 01:22:27.163
No, Jamie.
Uh, watch out.

01:22:27.203 --> 01:22:28.601
Watch out, Jamie.

01:22:28.627 --> 01:22:30.493
You know he's around.

01:22:30.533 --> 01:22:33.543
You... You know...

01:22:33.543 --> 01:22:36.083
Look, there he is.
I told you.

01:22:36.123 --> 01:22:38.833
I told you he was right around the corner.

01:22:38.883 --> 01:22:40.883
Jamie. Jamie.

01:22:42.303 --> 01:22:44.407
Jamie, look behind you.

01:22:44.433 --> 01:22:46.053
Look behind you.

01:22:46.053 --> 01:22:48.723
Turn around.
Behind you.

01:22:48.723 --> 01:22:50.538
All the time!

01:22:50.564 --> 01:22:52.353
Behind you!

01:22:52.393 --> 01:22:54.733
Behind you, Jamie.

01:22:54.733 --> 01:22:57.372
Jamie, turn around.

01:22:57.398 --> 01:22:59.733
Ohh! God! Yeah.

01:22:59.733 --> 01:23:02.573
Help me! Help!

01:23:14.123 --> 01:23:17.503
- Let me in!

01:23:17.543 --> 01:23:21.293
- The killer's coming after me! He's in the house!
- Where? Wait.

01:23:21.333 --> 01:23:24.883
- There's a camera in the house. Look.
- Behind you!

01:23:24.923 --> 01:23:26.803
- Oh, my God. No.
- Oh, shit.

01:23:26.843 --> 01:23:29.093
Jamie. Jamie.

01:23:29.093 --> 01:23:31.803
- Behind you, kid!
- Randy!

01:23:31.853 --> 01:23:34.643
- Behind ya!
- Look around!

01:23:36.483 --> 01:23:38.943
- Shit.
- What?

01:23:38.943 --> 01:23:41.483
- We're on 30-second delay.
- Oh, my God.

01:23:42.983 --> 01:23:44.783
Aaaah!

01:23:48.783 --> 01:23:51.073
The... door.

01:23:54.953 --> 01:23:57.793
Aaah!

01:24:34.663 --> 01:24:38.253
- Is there a phone in the van?
- Yeah.

01:24:38.293 --> 01:24:39.709
Lock yourself in it.

01:24:39.735 --> 01:24:41.858
Call the sheriff for backup.

01:24:43.333 --> 01:24:45.293
Be careful!

01:24:58.393 --> 01:25:02.313
- Neil?

01:25:05.863 --> 01:25:07.823
Mr. Prescott?

01:25:09.903 --> 01:25:11.863
Shit!

01:25:19.873 --> 01:25:22.913
Oh!

01:25:28.253 --> 01:25:30.673
Kenny, I need the cellular!

01:25:32.883 --> 01:25:34.843
Kenny!

01:25:36.553 --> 01:25:39.933
- Kenny!
- Kenny! Kenny!

01:26:00.203 --> 01:26:03.873
- 9-1-1.

01:26:03.913 --> 01:26:06.793
- What's going on?
- Ooh! Aah!

01:26:06.833 --> 01:26:09.213
Aaaah!

01:26:18.973 --> 01:26:20.973
Oh, God!

01:26:30.273 --> 01:26:32.733
Oh!

01:26:37.203 --> 01:26:40.583
Oh, God, Kenny, I'm sorry, but get off my fucking windshield!

01:26:45.623 --> 01:26:47.793
- Stop!

01:26:55.883 --> 01:26:57.843
Oh, God!

01:27:05.023 --> 01:27:08.023
Dewey!

01:27:08.063 --> 01:27:10.023
Dewey!

01:27:10.063 --> 01:27:13.943
- Dewey, where are you?

01:27:13.983 --> 01:27:15.943
Dewey!

01:27:16.993 --> 01:27:18.663
Sidney?

01:27:23.663 --> 01:27:25.703
Dewey!

01:27:53.233 --> 01:27:54.733
Shit!

01:28:20.883 --> 01:28:24.643
7825, suspect at 105 North Avenue 52.

01:28:24.683 --> 01:28:25.802
Hello. Help me, please.

01:28:25.828 --> 01:28:27.893
I'm at Stu Marker's house on Turner Lane.

01:28:27.933 --> 01:28:29.455
It's 261 Turner Lane.

01:28:29.481 --> 01:28:32.378
Please, he's going to try and kill me.

01:28:54.793 --> 01:28:56.233
Sidney!

01:28:56.559 --> 01:28:58.093
Sidney!

01:28:58.093 --> 01:29:00.593
Jesus, we've got to get the fuck out of here!

01:29:00.593 --> 01:29:02.712
- Stop right there!
- Don't shoot. It's me!

01:29:02.738 --> 01:29:04.013
I found Tatum.
She's dead.

01:29:04.053 --> 01:29:06.053
- I think Stu did it.
- Don't listen to him, Sidney!

01:29:06.103 --> 01:29:08.103
- Stay back!
- Stu did it.

01:29:08.103 --> 01:29:10.733
- He killed Billy. He killed my Tatum.
- You did it!

01:29:10.773 --> 01:29:13.103
- He killed my Tatum!
- No, I didn't! - You lie!

01:29:13.143 --> 01:29:15.443
Sidney, baby, please, give me that gun!

01:29:15.443 --> 01:29:17.443
Give me that gun!
Christ, man!

01:29:17.483 --> 01:29:19.903
No, I didn't.
Sid, he did it!

01:29:19.943 --> 01:29:22.445
He did it, Sidney!
Please, I didn't do it.

01:29:22.471 --> 01:29:23.493
He did it. Please!

01:29:23.533 --> 01:29:26.073
- Please, Sidney. Oh!
- Fuck you both!

01:29:26.123 --> 01:29:28.793
- Please!
- No! No! Sidney!

01:29:28.833 --> 01:29:30.300
- Open up!

01:29:30.326 --> 01:29:31.913
He did it!

01:29:31.963 --> 01:29:33.295
Help me!

01:29:33.321 --> 01:29:36.293
He's going crazy!

01:29:36.333 --> 01:29:38.423
- Sidney! Go away!

01:29:38.463 --> 01:29:40.803
Sidney?

01:29:40.843 --> 01:29:44.633
Leave me alone.

01:29:47.513 --> 01:29:49.763
- Sid.
- Billy.

01:29:54.813 --> 01:29:59.233
Oh! Billy. Billy.
Are you okay?

01:29:59.273 --> 01:30:02.153
- I'm okay.
- I thought you were dead.

01:30:02.153 --> 01:30:04.993
No, I'm like a stuck pig, but I'm all right.

01:30:05.033 --> 01:30:07.163
Get up.

01:30:07.203 --> 01:30:09.493
- I'm okay.
- You're bleeding.

01:30:10.543 --> 01:30:12.503
- Oh, my God.
- We've gotta get help.

01:30:12.543 --> 01:30:14.472
- No, he's out there!
- No, give me the gun.

01:30:14.498 --> 01:30:15.673
Give me the gun.
 It's okay.

01:30:15.713 --> 01:30:18.133
It's okay. It's okay.

01:30:18.173 --> 01:30:20.133
Careful.

01:30:21.253 --> 01:30:23.803
- Please help me!
- Come in, come in!

01:30:23.843 --> 01:30:26.053
Stu's flipped out!
He's gone mad!

01:30:28.473 --> 01:30:30.683
We all go a little mad sometimes.

01:30:30.683 --> 01:30:32.603
- No, Billy!
- Oh, fuck!

01:30:38.563 --> 01:30:41.983
Anthony Perkins, "Psycho."

01:30:45.703 --> 01:30:48.033
Mmm.

01:30:48.033 --> 01:30:52.703
Corn syrup.
Same stuff they used for pig's blood in "Carrie."

01:30:55.873 --> 01:30:58.173
Stu.

01:30:58.213 --> 01:31:02.053
Help me, please.

01:31:02.093 --> 01:31:05.173
Surprise, Sidney.

01:31:08.303 --> 01:31:11.013
- No!
- Ooh!

01:31:11.053 --> 01:31:13.723
Oh, now. Whoa.

01:31:15.393 --> 01:31:16.882
What's the matter, Sidney?

01:31:16.908 --> 01:31:18.943
You look like you've seen a ghost.

01:31:18.983 --> 01:31:21.693
Why are you doing this?

01:31:21.733 --> 01:31:23.783
It's all part of the game, Sidney.

01:31:23.823 --> 01:31:26.613
- It's called "Guess How I'm Gonna Die."
- Fuck you!

01:31:26.653 --> 01:31:31.283
No, no, no, no, no.
We already played that game, remember?

01:31:31.323 --> 01:31:34.413
- You lost.
- It's a fun game, Sidney.

01:31:34.453 --> 01:31:37.503
See, we ask you a question, and if you get it wrong,

01:31:37.543 --> 01:31:39.753
"boo-kah," you die!

01:31:39.753 --> 01:31:42.883
You get it right, you die.

01:31:42.923 --> 01:31:44.216
You're crazy, both of you.

01:31:44.242 --> 01:31:46.553
Actually, we prefer the term "psychotic."

01:31:46.593 --> 01:31:50.723
- You'll never get away with this.
- Oh, no?

01:31:51.593 --> 01:31:53.813
Tell that to Cotton Weary.

01:31:53.853 --> 01:31:56.603
You wouldn't believe how easy he was to frame.

01:31:56.643 --> 01:32:00.603
Watch a few movies, take a few notes.

01:32:00.653 --> 01:32:03.063
- It was fun. - No!

01:32:03.113 --> 01:32:05.403
- Whoa!
- Where're you goin'?

01:32:05.443 --> 01:32:08.153
Why?

01:32:08.193 --> 01:32:10.743
- Why did you kill my mother?

01:32:10.783 --> 01:32:14.583
Why? Why?

01:32:14.623 --> 01:32:15.804
Did you hear that, Stu?

01:32:15.830 --> 01:32:17.318
I think she wants a motive.

01:32:19.503 --> 01:32:21.463
I don't really believe in motive, Sid.

01:32:21.503 --> 01:32:23.463
- I mean, did Norman Bates have a motive?
- No.

01:32:23.503 --> 01:32:26.839
Did they ever really decide why Hannibal Lecter liked to eat people?

01:32:26.865 --> 01:32:27.673
Don't think so!

01:32:27.713 --> 01:32:31.513
See, it's a lot scarier when there's no motive, Sid.

01:32:31.553 --> 01:32:34.103
We did your mom a favor, Sid.

01:32:34.143 --> 01:32:37.773
That woman was a slut-bag whore who flashed her
shit all over town like she was Sharon Stone.

01:32:37.813 --> 01:32:40.273
Yeah, we put her out of her misery, 'cause let's face it, Sidney,

01:32:40.313 --> 01:32:43.483
your mother was no Sharon Stone, hmm?

01:32:48.653 --> 01:32:51.203
Is that motive enough for you?

01:32:52.363 --> 01:32:55.663
How about this?

01:32:55.663 --> 01:33:00.203
Your slut mother was fucking my father,

01:33:02.003 --> 01:33:05.673
and she's the reason my mom moved out and abandoned me.

01:33:08.343 --> 01:33:10.383
How's that for a motive?

01:33:10.383 --> 01:33:14.013
Maternal abandonment causes serious deviant behavior.

01:33:14.053 --> 01:33:15.165
It certainly fucked you up.

01:33:15.191 --> 01:33:16.853
It made you have sex with a psychopath.

01:33:16.853 --> 01:33:18.783
That's right.
You gave it up.

01:33:18.809 --> 01:33:21.313
Now you're no longer a virgin. Oooh!

01:33:21.353 --> 01:33:23.353
I said "virgin."
Whoops!

01:33:23.393 --> 01:33:24.748
Now you gotta die.

01:33:24.774 --> 01:33:26.403
Those are the rules.

01:33:26.443 --> 01:33:28.825
Let's pretend it's all a scary movie, Sid.

01:33:28.851 --> 01:33:30.678
How do you think it's gonna end?

01:33:33.913 --> 01:33:35.999
Oh! Oh!
This is the greatest part!

01:33:36.025 --> 01:33:37.533
You're gonna love this.

01:33:37.533 --> 01:33:40.083
We got a surprise for you, Sidney.

01:33:40.123 --> 01:33:41.875
Yeah, you're gonna love this one.

01:33:41.901 --> 01:33:43.043
It's a scream, baby!

01:33:43.043 --> 01:33:44.278
Hold on a sec.

01:33:44.304 --> 01:33:46.043
I'll be right back.

01:33:46.043 --> 01:33:49.093
You know what time it is, Sid?

01:33:49.133 --> 01:33:51.173
It's after midnight.

01:33:51.213 --> 01:33:53.477
It's your mom's anniversary.

01:33:53.503 --> 01:33:54.933
Congratulations.

01:33:54.973 --> 01:33:57.893
We killed her exactly one year ago today.

01:33:57.893 --> 01:34:02.393
Attention!
Oh, what do we have behind door number three, Sidney?

01:34:02.433 --> 01:34:04.233
- Daddy!
- Whoa, hold it.

01:34:04.233 --> 01:34:06.063
That's enough.

01:34:06.103 --> 01:34:09.403
- Guess we won't be needing this anymore.
- Uh-huh!

01:34:09.403 --> 01:34:10.816
And, oh, look at this.

01:34:10.842 --> 01:34:12.743
Ring, ring. Won't need this.

01:34:12.743 --> 01:34:14.863
Got the ending figured out yet, Sid?

01:34:14.903 --> 01:34:15.630
Come on, Sidney.

01:34:15.656 --> 01:34:16.993
You think about it now, huh?

01:34:17.033 --> 01:34:18.583
Your daddy's the chief suspect.

01:34:18.609 --> 01:34:19.833
We cloned his cellular.

01:34:19.873 --> 01:34:21.726
The evidence is all right there, baby!

01:34:21.752 --> 01:34:23.293
What if your father snapped?

01:34:23.333 --> 01:34:24.814
Your mother's anniversary set him off,..

01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:26.583
..and he went on a murder spree, killing everyone.

01:34:26.583 --> 01:34:27.753
Except for Billy and me.

01:34:27.779 --> 01:34:28.923
We were left for dead.

01:34:28.923 --> 01:34:32.093
Then he... kills you...

01:34:32.133 --> 01:34:34.843
and shoots himself in the head.

01:34:34.883 --> 01:34:37.763
- Perfect ending.
- I thought of that.

01:34:37.763 --> 01:34:39.763
Watch this.

01:34:43.733 --> 01:34:48.103
- Ready?
- Yeah. Yeah! I'm ready, baby!

01:34:48.103 --> 01:34:49.679
Right! Get up!

01:34:49.705 --> 01:34:52.968
Yeah, babe, get up!
Hit it!

01:34:57.743 --> 01:35:00.283
Good one, man.
Jesus.

01:35:00.323 --> 01:35:02.083
Oh, shit.

01:35:02.123 --> 01:35:04.413
My turn.

01:35:06.123 --> 01:35:06.956
Don't forget.

01:35:06.982 --> 01:35:09.608
Stay to the side and don't go too deep.

01:35:10.633 --> 01:35:13.303
Okay.
I'll remember.

01:35:14.303 --> 01:35:16.568
Aaah!
Fuck!

01:35:16.594 --> 01:35:17.803
Fuck!

01:35:17.803 --> 01:35:20.303
Fuck!
Goddamn it, Stu!

01:35:20.343 --> 01:35:23.433
Sorry, Billy.
I guess I got a little too zealous, huh?

01:35:23.473 --> 01:35:26.523
- Give me the knife.
- No.

01:35:26.563 --> 01:35:29.483
Give me the knife!

01:35:32.323 --> 01:35:34.283
Now!

01:35:36.533 --> 01:35:39.407
You see, Sid, everybody dies but us.

01:35:39.433 --> 01:35:41.323
Everybody dies but us.

01:35:41.323 --> 01:35:43.993
We get to carry on and plan the sequel,

01:35:44.043 --> 01:35:48.333
'cause let's face it, baby, these days ya gotta have a sequel!

01:35:51.043 --> 01:35:53.963
You sick fucks.
You've seen one too many movies.

01:35:54.003 --> 01:35:56.513
Now, Sid, don't you blame the movies.

01:35:56.553 --> 01:35:58.211
Movies don't create psychos.

01:35:58.237 --> 01:36:00.343
Movies make psychos more creative!

01:36:00.343 --> 01:36:04.063
Stop it, Billy, would you?
All right?

01:36:04.103 --> 01:36:05.721
I can't take any more.

01:36:05.747 --> 01:36:07.878
I feel a little woozy here!

01:36:10.563 --> 01:36:11.618
All right.

01:36:11.644 --> 01:36:14.573
All right, you get the gun.

01:36:14.613 --> 01:36:16.533
I'll untie Pops, okay?

01:36:19.903 --> 01:36:23.163
- Now!
- Okay.

01:36:32.213 --> 01:36:34.843
Um. Uh...

01:36:34.883 --> 01:36:38.553
Houston, we...
we have a problem here.

01:36:40.553 --> 01:36:43.183
- What?
- The gun, man. The gun.

01:36:43.223 --> 01:36:46.853
I put it right there, and it's not there.

01:36:46.893 --> 01:36:48.363
Where the fuck is it?

01:36:48.389 --> 01:36:50.208
Right here, asshole.

01:36:51.733 --> 01:36:53.535
Man, I thought she was dead.

01:36:53.561 --> 01:36:55.273
She looked dead, man.

01:36:55.313 --> 01:36:58.113
- Still does.
- I've got an ending for you.

01:36:58.153 --> 01:37:01.203
The reporter left for dead in the news van...

01:37:01.243 --> 01:37:03.323
comes to,

01:37:03.363 --> 01:37:05.743
stumbles on you two dipshits,

01:37:05.743 --> 01:37:07.913
finds the gun,

01:37:07.953 --> 01:37:11.753
foils your plan and saves the day.

01:37:11.753 --> 01:37:14.253
I like that ending.

01:37:15.593 --> 01:37:17.803
I know something you don't.

01:37:21.133 --> 01:37:23.843
Fuck. No!

01:37:26.603 --> 01:37:28.933
Yeah, man.

01:37:28.973 --> 01:37:29.973
Yeah.

01:37:29.999 --> 01:37:32.798
Aw, so sweet.

01:37:37.863 --> 01:37:42.403
- It works better without the safety on.

01:37:47.703 --> 01:37:50.833
This is Gale Weathers signing off.

01:37:50.873 --> 01:37:53.293
Babe, you're gonna love this!

01:37:55.543 --> 01:37:57.503
Shit.

01:37:59.133 --> 01:38:01.093
What?

01:38:06.893 --> 01:38:09.353
- Where are they?
Where are they?

01:38:09.393 --> 01:38:11.433
I don't know, but I'm hurtin', man.

01:38:11.473 --> 01:38:13.943
- Fuck!

01:38:13.983 --> 01:38:18.443
Shall I let the machine get it?

01:38:18.483 --> 01:38:21.323
- Hello?
- Are you alone in the house?

01:38:21.323 --> 01:38:23.653
Bitch! You bitch!
Where the fuck are you?

01:38:23.693 --> 01:38:24.485
Not so fast.

01:38:24.511 --> 01:38:26.663
We're gonna play a little game.

01:38:26.703 --> 01:38:31.623
It's called "Guess Who Just Called The Police
And Reported Your Sorry Motherfucking Ass."

01:38:31.663 --> 01:38:33.192
Find her, you dipshit.
Get up.

01:38:33.218 --> 01:38:35.333
I can't, Billy.
You cut me too deep.

01:38:35.333 --> 01:38:39.173
I think I'm dying here, man.

01:38:39.213 --> 01:38:42.673
- Talk to her.
 Talk to her.

01:38:49.513 --> 01:38:54.353
- Hello.
- Oh, Stu, Stu, Stu. What's your motive?

01:38:54.353 --> 01:38:56.247
Billy's got one.
The police are on their way.

01:38:56.273 --> 01:38:57.483
What are you gonna tell them?

01:38:57.523 --> 01:38:59.983
Peer pressure.
I'm far too sensitive.

01:39:00.023 --> 01:39:03.483
I'm gonna rip you up, you bitch, just like your fucking mother!

01:39:03.533 --> 01:39:06.283
- You've gotta find me first, you pansy-assed mama's boy!
- Fuck!

01:39:06.323 --> 01:39:09.203
Ow. You fuckin' hit me with the phone, dick!

01:39:09.243 --> 01:39:11.913
- Fucker, where are you?

01:39:14.043 --> 01:39:17.623
- You fuck!

01:39:17.673 --> 01:39:19.533
Did you really call the police?

01:39:19.559 --> 01:39:21.633
You bet your sorry ass I did.

01:39:21.673 --> 01:39:25.013
My mom and dad are gonna be so mad at me.

01:39:25.053 --> 01:39:28.133
Aaah! Bitch!

01:39:56.953 --> 01:39:59.293
Aaah!

01:40:02.293 --> 01:40:05.053
Aaah!

01:40:21.733 --> 01:40:25.023
Aah!

01:40:25.073 --> 01:40:27.233
Ohh! My arm!

01:40:34.163 --> 01:40:36.623
I always had a thing for ya, Sid!

01:40:42.293 --> 01:40:45.923
- Bitch.
- In your dreams.

01:41:10.403 --> 01:41:12.363
- I'm sorry.
 It's all right.

01:41:12.413 --> 01:41:14.533
Oh, my God, Randy, I thought you were dead.

01:41:14.573 --> 01:41:15.488
I probably should be.

01:41:15.514 --> 01:41:17.623
I never thought I'd be so happy to be a virgin.

01:41:17.663 --> 01:41:19.873
- Fucker!

01:41:25.503 --> 01:41:28.503
- Say hello to your mother.

01:41:35.223 --> 01:41:38.603
Aaah!

01:42:04.083 --> 01:42:06.043
It's okay.

01:42:08.883 --> 01:42:11.803
Guess I remembered the safety that time, you bastard.

01:42:24.103 --> 01:42:26.063
Careful.

01:42:26.103 --> 01:42:29.773
This is the moment when the supposedly dead killer comes back to life...

01:42:29.823 --> 01:42:31.783
for one last scare.

01:42:36.073 --> 01:42:39.743
Not in my movie.

01:42:43.753 --> 01:42:45.413
Dad.

01:42:45.463 --> 01:42:48.043
Randy, help me out.

01:42:51.753 --> 01:42:53.763
- Ow. Aah.
- Are you okay?

01:42:56.133 --> 01:42:58.933
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:43:00.393 --> 01:43:04.063
- Hang in there, buddy.
- All right.

01:43:04.063 --> 01:43:06.063
- Over here.
- Sorry, kid.

01:43:06.063 --> 01:43:09.161
Okay, I think it's going to go something like this.

01:43:09.187 --> 01:43:10.233
Just stay with me.

01:43:10.273 --> 01:43:13.283
- Hi, this is Gale Weathers...

01:43:13.323 --> 01:43:18.323
with an exclusive eyewitness account of this amazing breaking story.

01:43:18.363 --> 01:43:20.823
Several more local teens are dead...

01:43:20.873 --> 01:43:23.833
bringing to an end the harrowing mystery of the mass killing...

01:43:23.873 --> 01:43:26.503
that has terrified this peaceful community...

01:43:26.543 --> 01:43:29.293
like the plot of some scary movie.

01:43:29.293 --> 01:43:31.923
It all began with a scream over 9-1-1...

01:43:31.923 --> 01:43:36.263
and ended in a bloodbath that has rocked the town of Woodsboro,

01:43:36.303 --> 01:43:38.843
all played out here in this peaceful farmhouse...

01:43:38.883 --> 01:43:41.513
far from the crimes and the sirens of the larger cities...

01:43:41.553 --> 01:43:43.683
that its residents had fled.

01:43:43.723 --> 01:43:45.457
Okay, let's take it back to one.

01:43:45.483 --> 01:43:46.433
Come on.
 Move it.

01:43:46.483 --> 01:43:49.193
This is my big shot.
Let's go.
