WEBVTT

00:53.889 --> 00:56.058
"The movie will begin
in five moments"

00:56.141 --> 00:59.228
the mindless voice announced.

00:59.311 --> 01:03.899
"All those unseated
will await the next show."

01:04.024 --> 01:08.445
We filed slowly, languidly
into the hall.

01:08.570 --> 01:12.699
The auditorium was vast and silent.

01:12.783 --> 01:17.246
As we seated and were darkened,
the voice continued.

01:18.830 --> 01:21.124
"The program for this evening
is not new.

01:21.250 --> 01:23.710
You've seen this entertainment
through and through.

01:23.794 --> 01:25.879
You've seen your birth,
your life and death.

01:25.963 --> 01:27.506
You might recall all of the rest.

01:27.589 --> 01:30.259
Did you have a good world
when you died?

01:30.300 --> 01:32.970
Enough to base a movie on?"

01:33.011 --> 01:37.015
Hey, Jim, it's your birthday, man.

01:37.099 --> 01:40.644
What do you say
we finish this another night?

01:42.354 --> 01:45.566
Turn the lights down a little bit more,
will you, Jay?

01:52.698 --> 01:56.493
Hey, man.
How come the Doors aren't in on this?

01:57.870 --> 02:01.456
No music. No Doors.
Come on, let's roll.

02:02.207 --> 02:03.625
Rolling.

02:20.017 --> 02:22.728
Is everybody in?

02:29.151 --> 02:32.070
The ceremony is about to begin.

02:37.451 --> 02:39.453
Let me tell you about heartache...

02:39.494 --> 02:41.955
and the loss of God.

02:41.997 --> 02:46.126
Wandering, wandering in hopeless night.

02:46.168 --> 02:50.797
Out here, in the perimeter,
there are no stars.

02:50.881 --> 02:55.427
Out here, we is stoned, immaculate.

03:00.057 --> 03:02.976
It's beautiful.
Look at those big, puffy clouds.

03:04.061 --> 03:07.105
Hey, Jimmy.
Wake up. Look at the clouds.

03:07.189 --> 03:09.858
Come on.
Wake up.

03:16.615 --> 03:18.408
What's going on?

03:18.492 --> 03:20.661
I don't know.

03:34.466 --> 03:36.885
Officer, what happened?
Can we help?

03:36.969 --> 03:40.138
No, sir.
We've got everything under control.

03:52.818 --> 03:54.361
Just a dream, Jimmy.

03:54.444 --> 03:57.531
That's all it is.
It's just a dream

05:41.009 --> 05:43.470
Waiting for the medicine.

06:43.989 --> 06:45.449
On your finger.

06:45.490 --> 06:47.075
Wait here.
Don't go.

06:47.159 --> 06:48.660
I'll be right here.

07:04.968 --> 07:07.221
You got a problem with doors?

07:07.304 --> 07:09.223
Waste of time.

07:11.683 --> 07:13.644
I followed you from the beach.

07:15.312 --> 07:17.397
You followed me?

07:17.481 --> 07:19.816
- Why?
- 'Cause...

07:19.900 --> 07:21.818
you're the one.

07:38.794 --> 07:41.380
Maybe you should meet my old man.

07:41.463 --> 07:43.382
What's your name?

07:44.675 --> 07:47.261
- Mine's Jim.
- Pam.

07:55.227 --> 07:57.020
Who the hell was that?

07:57.104 --> 07:59.648
I have no idea.

08:01.024 --> 08:02.526
Nietzsche said...

08:02.609 --> 08:06.822
"All great things must first wear
terrifying and monstrous masks..

08:06.905 --> 08:09.867
In order to inscribe themselves...

08:09.950 --> 08:12.661
on the hearts of humanity."

08:12.703 --> 08:14.454
Listen, children...

08:14.538 --> 08:18.041
to the sound of the Nuremberg night.

08:19.126 --> 08:20.377
In a seance...

08:20.460 --> 08:24.298
the shaman leads a sensuous panic.

08:24.381 --> 08:29.887
He acts like a madman.
A professional hysteria.

08:29.928 --> 08:32.431
Have you ever seen God?

08:32.514 --> 08:35.225
Mandala?

08:35.267 --> 08:36.852
A symmetrical angel.

08:36.894 --> 08:39.938
We got our final vision by clap.

08:40.022 --> 08:43.192
Columbus' groin got filled
with green death.

08:43.232 --> 08:46.403
- I touched her thigh...
- This film is weak.

08:46.445 --> 08:49.031
And death smiled.

08:51.700 --> 08:54.286
Hey, Morrison.
Fuck them, man.

08:54.369 --> 08:56.705
It's great.
It's nonlinear, it's poetry.

08:56.788 --> 08:58.624
It's everything good art stands for.

08:59.541 --> 09:02.628
This world, a monster of energy.

09:02.711 --> 09:05.214
Without beginning, Without end.

09:05.297 --> 09:07.966
Likewise, without increase or income.

09:09.510 --> 09:11.845
Disclosing nothing.

09:11.929 --> 09:13.805
This world.

09:13.889 --> 09:16.725
This world is a will to power...

09:16.808 --> 09:19.186
and nothing besides.

09:24.358 --> 09:26.026
Pretty pretentious there.

09:26.068 --> 09:27.778
Not easy to follow.
A little incoherent.

09:27.861 --> 09:30.697
Dancing bears, Nazism, masturbation.

09:30.739 --> 09:32.241
What's next?

09:32.366 --> 09:34.701
- What do you guys think?
- A bore, man. I hated it.

09:34.785 --> 09:37.246
It was better than a Warhol picture!

09:37.329 --> 09:38.664
It was worse!

09:38.705 --> 09:40.332
A guy sleeping for seven hours?

09:40.415 --> 09:43.043
There was no political conscience.

09:43.126 --> 09:46.588
- You need your art spoon-fed to you.
- Right on!

09:47.714 --> 09:51.802
Hold it down.
Let's ask the filmmaker what he thinks.

09:54.888 --> 09:56.807
I quit.

10:19.246 --> 10:21.164
Awake.

10:22.916 --> 10:26.336
Shake dreams from your hair,
my pretty child, my sweet one.

10:26.461 --> 10:28.964
Choose the day
and choose the sign of your day.

10:29.047 --> 10:32.843
The day's divinity.
First thing I see.

10:32.926 --> 10:35.387
Come on out for a walk.

10:35.512 --> 10:38.390
It's a beautiful night.

10:38.515 --> 10:40.601
A vast, radiant beach...

10:40.684 --> 10:44.188
and a cool, jeweled moon.

10:44.229 --> 10:49.526
Couples, naked,
race down by its quiet side.

10:49.610 --> 10:52.613
And we laugh like soft, mad children...

10:52.696 --> 10:56.116
smug in the woolly,
cotton brains of infancy.

10:56.200 --> 11:00.329
Every time
I try to make love to you

11:00.370 --> 11:04.958
you run around
with your mouth stuck out

11:05.042 --> 11:09.171
Choose, they croon, the ancient ones.
The time has come again.

11:09.254 --> 11:12.090
Choose now, they croon,
beneath the moon...

11:12.132 --> 11:13.592
beside an ancient lake.

11:14.635 --> 11:16.929
Enter again the sweet forest.

11:16.970 --> 11:19.806
Enter the hot dream.
Come with us.

11:19.890 --> 11:21.475
Everything is broken up...

11:21.558 --> 11:23.810
and dances.

11:26.772 --> 11:29.024
I can't believe it's so beautiful.

11:29.107 --> 11:33.987
"Now I have come again to the land
of the fair, strong and the wise.

11:34.071 --> 11:36.365
Brothers and sisters
o'er the pale forest.

11:36.448 --> 11:38.325
O, children of night...

11:38.367 --> 11:40.035
who among you will run with the hunt?

11:41.495 --> 11:43.664
Now, night arrives with
her purple legion.

11:43.705 --> 11:47.084
Retire now to your tents and dreams.

11:47.167 --> 11:49.962
Tomorrow we enter
the town of my birth.

11:50.003 --> 11:52.130
I want to be ready."

11:54.174 --> 11:56.510
It's beautiful.

11:56.552 --> 11:59.638
- Do you like that?
- It's beautiful.

11:59.680 --> 12:02.641
I've never read much poetry before.

12:05.686 --> 12:07.646
What's a shaman?

12:10.858 --> 12:13.402
He's a medicine man...

12:13.485 --> 12:15.070
of the Indians.

12:15.153 --> 12:18.949
He gets into a peyote trance...

12:19.032 --> 12:24.079
and he gets deeper and deeper,
and then he has a vision...

12:24.121 --> 12:26.582
and the whole tribe is healed.

12:27.541 --> 12:30.711
All cultures have a version of it.

12:30.752 --> 12:33.005
Greeks had theater and gods.

12:34.381 --> 12:37.342
The Indians say the first shaman
invented sex.

12:37.426 --> 12:39.761
They called him
"The One Who Makes You Crazy."

12:41.388 --> 12:44.099
What turns you on?

12:46.393 --> 12:48.312
I don't know.

12:49.938 --> 12:52.399
Experience.

12:52.482 --> 12:54.735
Freedom.

12:54.818 --> 12:58.197
Love. Now.

12:58.280 --> 13:01.909
You know, the first time I did acid,
I saw God.

13:01.992 --> 13:05.829
And I saw a friend of mine
who was Christ and Judas too.

13:05.913 --> 13:08.123
Then I realized that...

13:08.165 --> 13:11.210
that was the secret of everything.

13:11.293 --> 13:14.463
We're all one,
the universe is one...

13:14.505 --> 13:17.883
and that everything is beautiful.

13:21.887 --> 13:24.890
I feel most alive...

13:24.932 --> 13:27.893
confronting death...

13:27.976 --> 13:29.561
experiencing pain.

13:29.603 --> 13:33.440
I think you're most alive
by recognizing beauty.

13:33.524 --> 13:35.442
Seeing truth.

13:36.527 --> 13:39.321
Does death turn you on?

13:39.404 --> 13:41.323
You love death?

13:42.449 --> 13:44.910
Life hurts a lot more.

13:44.993 --> 13:47.371
When you die, the pain's over.

13:59.132 --> 14:01.969
All the poems have wolves in it.

14:02.052 --> 14:04.304
All but one.

14:04.346 --> 14:07.057
The most beautiful one of all.

14:08.851 --> 14:13.188
"She dances in a ring of fire...

14:13.272 --> 14:16.525
and throws off the challenge
with a shrug."

14:19.611 --> 14:21.530
That's beautiful.

14:22.823 --> 14:26.034
Who did you write that for?

14:26.076 --> 14:28.453
I wrote it for you.

15:00.360 --> 15:02.279
Try acid, Ray.

15:03.363 --> 15:05.949
It's guaranteed.

15:06.074 --> 15:07.993
Shit, Morrison.

15:10.412 --> 15:12.456
My last trip was a real bummer, man.

15:12.581 --> 15:14.917
I never had a bummer on acid.

15:15.000 --> 15:16.877
I'm trying naturally high now.

15:16.960 --> 15:18.795
Whatever works.

15:18.879 --> 15:20.881
Making movies at MGM yet?

15:20.964 --> 15:23.717
I got in to see the head of production.

15:23.800 --> 15:26.386
He said, "Where's your script?"
I said, " I don't need a script.

15:26.470 --> 15:28.972
Godard doesn't use a script.
He improvises."

15:29.097 --> 15:32.017
The guy says, "Great. Who's Godard?"

15:32.100 --> 15:34.019
I'm off movies, man.

15:35.729 --> 15:38.732
I went out to the desert.
Got lost.

15:40.025 --> 15:42.277
I've been living up on Trick's rooftop.

15:43.862 --> 15:46.865
- Got stuck on a chick.
- So what else you doing?

15:46.949 --> 15:50.869
Writing songs, poems.
Stuff like that.

15:50.953 --> 15:54.039
You're writing songs?

15:54.081 --> 15:55.582
So let me hear one.

15:55.666 --> 15:58.043
I'm shy.

15:58.126 --> 16:00.420
- Sing it to me.
- I can't sing.

16:00.504 --> 16:01.713
You sing better than Dylan?

16:01.755 --> 16:03.215
Johnny's in the basement

16:03.257 --> 16:05.884
Mixing up the medicine
I'm on the pavement

16:05.926 --> 16:07.261
Thinking about the government

16:08.846 --> 16:10.764
Let me hear your words.

16:16.520 --> 16:18.438
All right.

16:20.399 --> 16:25.070
Let's swim to the moon

16:25.112 --> 16:28.740
Let's climb through the tide

16:30.075 --> 16:33.662
Penetrate the evening

16:33.745 --> 16:38.667
That the city sleeps to hide

16:42.087 --> 16:45.549
Let's swim out tonight, love

16:45.632 --> 16:49.845
It's our turn to try

16:50.971 --> 16:55.184
Park beside the ocean

16:55.267 --> 16:57.728
On our

16:57.811 --> 17:01.023
Moonlight drive

17:10.656 --> 17:12.701
Those are great fucking lyrics, man.

17:12.784 --> 17:16.454
- Yeah?
- Yeah. You write this?

17:16.538 --> 17:18.832
You got others in here?

17:18.915 --> 17:21.502
A bunch, man.
I got a whole concert in my head.

17:21.585 --> 17:23.337
I can see it all.

17:23.420 --> 17:25.380
What the hell happened to you
in the desert, man?

17:25.422 --> 17:26.924
- Ecstasy and madness.
- Let's get a band together...

17:27.007 --> 17:28.800
and make a million bucks!

17:28.884 --> 17:31.261
- I got tons of songs.
- Things are about to explode.

17:31.345 --> 17:34.264
I can feel it in the air.
People want to fight or fuck.

17:34.306 --> 17:37.017
Love or kill.
Vietnam is right out there.

17:37.100 --> 17:39.019
Sides are being chosen.

17:39.102 --> 17:42.606
Everything's gonna flame.
The planet is screaming for change.

17:42.648 --> 17:44.608
We gotta make the myths.

17:44.650 --> 17:46.693
There ought to be great orgies, man.

17:46.777 --> 17:50.489
When Dionysus arrived in Greece,
he made all the women mad.

17:50.531 --> 17:53.575
Leaving their homes
and dancing off into the mountains.

17:53.659 --> 17:57.329
There should be great, golden
copulations in the streets of L.A.

17:57.371 --> 17:58.664
We should call ourselves Dionysus.

17:58.705 --> 18:01.166
I got a name.
Doors.

18:01.208 --> 18:03.836
You mean "The Doors In Your Mind"?
The Huxley book?

18:03.877 --> 18:06.004
- Doors of perception. Acid.
- That's great.

18:06.046 --> 18:08.006
The quote's from William Blake.

18:08.090 --> 18:10.300
"When the doors of perception
are cleansed...

18:10.342 --> 18:12.302
things will appear
as they truly are."

18:12.344 --> 18:15.013
Mescaline experiments.
Reducing the sugar flow to the brain.

18:15.055 --> 18:17.015
Come on!

18:27.109 --> 18:30.487
You know the day destroys the night

18:30.571 --> 18:32.614
Night divides the day

18:33.699 --> 18:35.033
Try to run

18:35.075 --> 18:36.618
Try to hide

18:36.743 --> 18:39.621
Break on through to the other side

18:45.878 --> 18:47.838
What's the matter?

18:47.921 --> 18:49.798
- It just doesn't sound right.
- I know that, John.

18:49.882 --> 18:51.884
Jim, stay in time.

18:51.967 --> 18:53.468
I say we try that bossa nova beat.

18:55.137 --> 18:56.597
I think it's hot.

18:59.308 --> 19:01.351
I think the lyrics are kind of weird.

19:03.270 --> 19:05.105
You write one, man.

19:06.440 --> 19:08.775
We need more songs anyway.

19:08.817 --> 19:11.111
I thought it was pretty good.

19:11.153 --> 19:13.572
Let's go outside.

19:24.082 --> 19:26.001
I came up with something.

19:29.505 --> 19:32.966
A minor, then F sharp.

19:39.640 --> 19:43.227
You know that it would be untrue

19:43.352 --> 19:46.855
You know that I would be a liar

19:46.939 --> 19:50.901
If I was to say to you

19:50.984 --> 19:54.530
Girl, we couldn't get much higher

19:54.613 --> 19:58.242
Come on, baby, light my fire

19:58.325 --> 20:01.620
- G, A, D.
- Pretty good. Pretty neat.

20:01.703 --> 20:04.957
Try to set the night on fire

20:05.040 --> 20:06.959
Great, Robby.
You got nice changes in there.

20:07.042 --> 20:09.044
- Got anymore lyrics?
- I got some.

20:09.127 --> 20:11.797
I call it "Light My Fire."

20:11.839 --> 20:16.510
If I'm gonna compete with your stuff, it
better be about earth, snakes or fire.

20:16.593 --> 20:19.388
I like it.
Sounds like the Byrds though.

20:19.471 --> 20:21.974
But I like it.
It's good.

20:22.015 --> 20:23.767
A little Latin beat'll
do it some justice.

20:23.809 --> 20:28.146
Maybe put a couple long solos,
like Coltrane on "My Favorite Things."

20:28.188 --> 20:30.941
Start over, man.

20:30.983 --> 20:33.819
A minor, B minor.
It's jazz.

20:33.861 --> 20:36.071
The time to hesitate is through

20:36.154 --> 20:40.868
- Some kind of intro.
- No time to wallow in the mire

20:40.951 --> 20:44.121
Try now, we can only lose

20:44.204 --> 20:48.083
And our love becomes a funeral pyre

20:48.166 --> 20:51.503
Come on baby, light my fire

20:55.424 --> 20:58.886
Try to set the night on fire

21:01.930 --> 21:04.558
- Can you give me--
- Try now, we can only lose

21:04.641 --> 21:08.228
Can you give me five minutes?
I got to figure out some kind of intro.

21:08.312 --> 21:11.148
- Let's let him work. You like that?
- Yeah, I like Laguna Beach, man.

21:13.150 --> 21:14.443
Funeral pyre.

21:18.322 --> 21:21.241
What do you think about when you play?

21:21.283 --> 21:23.994
I don't know.

21:24.077 --> 21:26.038
Fish in my fish tank.

21:27.789 --> 21:31.376
- How about that acid tonight, man?
- Not for me.

21:31.460 --> 21:34.296
- Not me, either.
- Right here at Ray's house.

21:34.379 --> 21:36.673
See what kind of trouble
we can get into tonight.

21:36.757 --> 21:38.759
No way.
You always get all the chicks.

21:38.800 --> 21:40.302
I always get the dogs.

21:40.344 --> 21:42.221
Hey, I got it!
Come on!

21:42.304 --> 21:43.639
I got it!
I got the intro!

21:43.722 --> 21:46.808
Hang on a second.
John, count off in four, man.

21:46.850 --> 21:48.352
One, two, three.

22:14.545 --> 22:17.798
Is that horny fucker
in the black pants here tonight?

22:17.881 --> 22:20.259
No l.D.'s, you can't get in.

22:27.599 --> 22:30.352
Yeah, we chased our pleasures here

22:30.435 --> 22:32.604
Dug our treasures there

22:32.646 --> 22:35.482
Can't you still recall
The time we tried

22:35.566 --> 22:38.569
Break on through to the other side

22:57.796 --> 23:00.799
Turn around, man.
Come on, let them in.

23:00.841 --> 23:03.760
I found an island in your arms

23:03.844 --> 23:06.430
A country in your eyes

23:06.513 --> 23:09.183
Arms that chain us Eyes that lie

23:09.224 --> 23:11.560
Break on through to the other side

23:16.481 --> 23:18.400
All right

23:20.569 --> 23:24.364
I'm a big fan!
Give it to me!

23:24.406 --> 23:25.782
Made the scene

23:25.866 --> 23:27.201
Week to week

23:27.284 --> 23:29.578
Day to day Hour to hour

23:29.661 --> 23:32.581
The gate is straight
Deep and wide

23:32.664 --> 23:34.875
Break on through to the other side

23:44.927 --> 23:46.678
All right

23:48.263 --> 23:51.558
Hi, Jim.
Can I have your autograph?

23:51.600 --> 23:54.269
- I don't know. Where do you want it?
- Anywhere you want it.

23:54.394 --> 23:56.313
Leave it to me.
I can take you all the fucking way.

23:56.396 --> 23:58.690
- You blew my mind.
- Did you like the music?

23:58.774 --> 24:00.901
I loved it.
That's why we're talking.

24:00.984 --> 24:03.529
Some of it's on the dark side.
You ought to get some tunes.

24:03.654 --> 24:06.365
Herman's Hermits stuff.
Mrs. Brown, you've got a lovely daughter

24:06.490 --> 24:08.033
That shit goes right to the radio.

24:08.158 --> 24:11.078
I need him here
to groove on my boyfriend.

24:12.996 --> 24:14.748
What about getting us
some real equipment?

24:14.831 --> 24:16.583
I sign you
to a five-year management contract--

24:16.667 --> 24:18.669
You with the joint.
Put that out, please.

24:18.710 --> 24:21.213
- We can smell that upstairs.
- I can get you there.

24:21.338 --> 24:23.131
Trust me for a while.
What do you say?

24:23.215 --> 24:24.842
We'll have a band meeting on it.

24:24.925 --> 24:28.971
We do everything unanimously
or we don't do it.

24:29.054 --> 24:30.305
The Musketeers.

24:30.389 --> 24:32.516
I'm touched.

24:32.641 --> 24:35.102
Let me tell you something.
Loyalty don't pay the bills.

24:35.185 --> 24:39.064
Think about it and call me tomorrow.
Here's my card.

24:43.193 --> 24:46.572
Pay attention.
You could get rich.

24:46.655 --> 24:48.949
- Are you blind?
- How old are you?

24:49.032 --> 24:51.410
- Twenty-one.
- Get lost, will you?

24:53.036 --> 24:57.749
I'll make this quick and to the point.
If you repeat it, I'll deny it.

24:57.791 --> 24:59.251
Drop those guys.

24:59.334 --> 25:01.920
Jim's got to start facing the crowd
if he's going to be our front man.

25:02.004 --> 25:03.422
He's just getting his confidence.

25:03.463 --> 25:06.925
- The guy never does what's rehearsed--
- Well, how does it feel?

25:07.009 --> 25:08.302
It feels great, but--

25:08.385 --> 25:11.138
Your looks. Your voice.
That's what's going to sell records.

25:11.180 --> 25:12.806
We'll make a million bucks a year.

25:12.890 --> 25:14.558
Call me.
I'm right.

25:14.641 --> 25:16.977
Hey, man, let's go.

25:17.060 --> 25:19.813
Do yourself a favor.
Call Larry.

25:19.897 --> 25:22.441
I like a guy
who wears his soul on his face.

25:22.482 --> 25:26.445
Whisky's next, man.
I can feel it in my bones.

25:27.988 --> 25:29.656
I still think the lyrics are weird.

25:29.740 --> 25:31.950
The days are bright

25:31.992 --> 25:35.162
And filled with pain

25:35.245 --> 25:40.667
Enclose me in your gentle rain

25:40.751 --> 25:44.922
The time you ran

25:45.005 --> 25:49.551
Was too insane

25:49.593 --> 25:51.887
We'll meet again

25:54.973 --> 25:57.059
The chicks are really
digging you tonight, man.

25:57.142 --> 25:58.894
We still got to deepen, man.

25:58.936 --> 26:01.396
- We got to go one more step.
- Turn around and face the crowd.

26:01.438 --> 26:02.940
It'll help present it better.

26:03.023 --> 26:04.775
I got to go to the desert
and take that peyote.

26:04.858 --> 26:06.443
Is that what you're on?

26:06.527 --> 26:08.654
Yeah, man.
It's kicking in!

26:08.737 --> 26:11.573
- Fucking longhair!
- He's fucking crazy.

26:11.615 --> 26:14.243
- Come on.
- I'm not doing acid, man.

26:14.326 --> 26:16.453
It's peyote.

26:16.537 --> 26:19.456
What's a rock and roll band for?

26:19.540 --> 26:22.459
Let's plan a murder or start a religion.

26:22.501 --> 26:24.795
More, more, more!

26:24.837 --> 26:27.256
I'm into T.M., man.
I promised my guru.

26:27.297 --> 26:29.341
I'll try it.
I'm ready.

26:29.424 --> 26:30.634
Let's go to the desert.

26:30.717 --> 26:32.636
Let's do the peyote.

26:34.555 --> 26:36.640
Who's on next?

26:36.682 --> 26:39.059
Arthur Lee.
He's cool.

26:41.979 --> 26:44.106
I am the lizard king!

26:44.147 --> 26:46.149
I can do anything!

26:46.233 --> 26:49.403
Raise your hands if you understand.

26:50.612 --> 26:54.908
Let's take a poll.
How many of you know you're alive?

26:54.992 --> 26:57.661
Bullshit!

26:57.703 --> 27:01.081
You're plastic soldiers
in a miniature dirt war.

27:01.164 --> 27:03.542
Come on!

27:03.584 --> 27:06.545
How many of you people
know you're alive?

27:47.628 --> 27:50.130
Close your eyes.

27:50.172 --> 27:51.924
You see the snake.

27:52.799 --> 27:55.594
See the serpent appear?

27:55.636 --> 27:56.929
His head is ten feet long...

27:56.970 --> 27:59.181
and five feet wide.

27:59.223 --> 28:01.350
He has one red eye and one green eye.

28:01.391 --> 28:04.311
That's all right.
It gets better.

28:04.353 --> 28:05.896
Peace.

28:07.189 --> 28:09.107
Seven miles long.

28:13.028 --> 28:14.947
Deadly.

28:17.533 --> 28:21.203
See it.
All the history of the world...

28:21.286 --> 28:23.705
is on its scales.

28:23.789 --> 28:26.041
All people.
All actions.

28:26.124 --> 28:30.045
We're all just little pictures
in the scales.

28:32.256 --> 28:35.133
God, it's big.

28:36.426 --> 28:38.345
It's moving.

28:39.930 --> 28:42.599
Devouring consciousness.

28:43.809 --> 28:45.978
Digesting power.

28:48.105 --> 28:51.358
Monster of energy.

28:51.441 --> 28:53.402
It's a monster.

28:54.945 --> 28:59.491
I'm gonna kiss the snake on the tongue.

28:59.616 --> 29:02.035
Kiss the serpent.

29:02.119 --> 29:05.122
But if it senses fear...

29:05.247 --> 29:08.166
it'll eat us instantly.

29:08.250 --> 29:10.586
But if we kiss it without fear...

29:10.669 --> 29:13.046
it'll take us through the garden.

29:13.172 --> 29:14.882
Through the gate.

29:15.007 --> 29:18.343
To the other side.

29:18.427 --> 29:21.513
Ride the snake...

29:21.597 --> 29:23.515
'til the end of time.

29:25.934 --> 29:28.687
I think I'm fucked up, man.

29:28.770 --> 29:30.272
I'm not thinking right.

29:30.355 --> 29:33.233
Look at your eyes, man.
You're death.

29:33.317 --> 29:35.444
I'm afraid of my father.

29:37.029 --> 29:39.198
I can't be what they want me to be.

29:39.239 --> 29:41.033
Maybe you should kill your father.

29:41.074 --> 29:42.409
I'm in pain, man.

29:45.162 --> 29:47.080
I feel the universe
functioning perfectly...

29:47.164 --> 29:51.960
but I'm still perfectly locked
inside myself.

29:52.044 --> 29:55.214
Instead of oneness, I feel isolation.

29:56.256 --> 29:58.175
But you're alive.

29:58.258 --> 30:00.928
- Feel it.
- I'm scared.

30:01.011 --> 30:02.888
- It's beautiful.
- I'm still scared.

30:02.930 --> 30:05.015
Then use us.

30:05.098 --> 30:08.310
Use our strength.
Come on in here.

30:08.393 --> 30:10.270
That's right.

30:10.312 --> 30:13.941
We're a tribe now.
A tribe of warriors.

30:14.816 --> 30:19.071
I promise you, I'll be with you
to the end of time.

30:19.154 --> 30:21.698
Nothing will destroy our circle.

30:21.782 --> 30:23.700
Ride the snake.

30:27.955 --> 30:29.873
Come on.

30:30.999 --> 30:35.838
My wild love went riding

30:35.921 --> 30:40.467
She rode all the day

30:40.509 --> 30:45.472
She rode to the devil

30:45.514 --> 30:49.268
Asked him to pay

30:50.227 --> 30:54.857
My wild love went riding

30:54.898 --> 30:58.235
She went to the sea

30:59.570 --> 31:03.282
She went to the devil

31:04.867 --> 31:08.662
All that's left was we

31:22.551 --> 31:25.470
I'm lying.
I am afraid.

31:35.731 --> 31:37.649
Don't go away!

31:39.109 --> 31:41.195
Come dance with me!

31:48.285 --> 31:50.204
Where you going, Jimmy?

32:03.884 --> 32:06.678
This is the end

32:06.720 --> 32:10.557
Beautiful friend

32:13.185 --> 32:16.063
This is the end

32:16.146 --> 32:20.734
My only friend, the end

32:20.776 --> 32:24.613
Of our elaborate plans

32:24.696 --> 32:26.698
The end

32:26.740 --> 32:30.786
Of everything that stands

32:30.869 --> 32:32.788
The end

32:32.871 --> 32:36.583
No safety or surprise

32:36.625 --> 32:38.627
The end

32:38.752 --> 32:41.463
I'll never look

32:41.547 --> 32:44.758
Into your eyes

32:44.800 --> 32:47.010
Again

32:51.181 --> 32:56.144
Can you picture what we'll be

32:56.270 --> 33:00.399
So limitless and free

33:01.483 --> 33:05.028
Desperately in need

33:05.153 --> 33:08.740
Of some stranger's hand

33:10.117 --> 33:14.413
In a desperate land

33:46.361 --> 33:50.866
Lost in a Roman

33:50.949 --> 33:55.454
Wilderness of pain

33:57.372 --> 34:02.169
And all the children

34:02.294 --> 34:05.297
Are insane

34:20.062 --> 34:24.733
Waiting for the summer rain

34:41.958 --> 34:46.129
There's danger on the edge of town

34:51.552 --> 34:56.014
Ride the king's highway, baby

35:00.435 --> 35:04.731
Weird scenes inside the gold mine

35:09.403 --> 35:14.157
Ride the highway west, baby

35:18.829 --> 35:21.790
Ride the snake

35:28.338 --> 35:30.883
To the lake

35:32.676 --> 35:36.180
The ancient lake, baby

35:37.097 --> 35:41.435
The snake is long

35:41.518 --> 35:44.646
Seven miles

35:46.440 --> 35:48.483
Ride the snake

35:51.486 --> 35:54.281
He's old

35:55.741 --> 35:59.036
And his skin is cold

36:05.334 --> 36:09.046
The west is the best

36:19.640 --> 36:22.768
Get here and we'll do the rest

36:30.484 --> 36:34.279
The blue bus

36:34.321 --> 36:38.450
ls calling us

36:48.502 --> 36:53.173
Driver, where you taking us

37:08.689 --> 37:12.150
The killer awoke before dawn.

37:12.234 --> 37:14.570
He put his boots on.

37:17.573 --> 37:18.866
He took a face...

37:18.907 --> 37:20.742
from the ancient gallery...

37:20.826 --> 37:24.329
and he walked on down the hall.

37:32.129 --> 37:36.175
He went into the room
where his sister lived.

37:36.300 --> 37:37.926
Then he...

37:40.637 --> 37:42.347
paid a visit to his brother.

37:42.431 --> 37:45.350
Then he--

37:45.434 --> 37:49.479
He walked on down the hall.

37:51.815 --> 37:55.152
And he came to a door.

37:56.236 --> 37:59.448
He looked inside.

38:05.162 --> 38:06.997
"Father."
"Yes, son?"

38:07.080 --> 38:09.333
"I want to kill you."

38:14.171 --> 38:15.839
"Mother."

38:18.926 --> 38:21.970
I want to

38:22.054 --> 38:24.598
fuck you all night, baby

38:25.432 --> 38:27.392
Come on, baby

38:30.896 --> 38:32.439
"Mother, I want to fuck you"?

38:34.775 --> 38:36.193
Come on

38:41.281 --> 38:43.325
Fuck, fuck

38:43.408 --> 38:46.036
Turn him off!
Turn his fucking amp off!

38:53.001 --> 38:54.753
Fuck me, baby

39:07.641 --> 39:08.809
Come on, baby

39:08.892 --> 39:10.602
- He's insane!
- He's a great artist!

39:10.644 --> 39:12.312
- We all love it!
- Come on

39:25.367 --> 39:27.369
All right

39:33.166 --> 39:36.420
Kill

39:48.640 --> 39:49.933
Get him out of here!

39:50.017 --> 39:52.936
- Get the fuck out of here!
- Kill the father.

39:54.438 --> 39:57.191
Nobody's gonna fuck their mother
on my stage!

39:57.274 --> 39:59.484
- That's what I mean!
- You're out of here!

39:59.568 --> 40:01.862
Kill your father!
Fuck the mother!

40:01.945 --> 40:03.614
All right!

40:03.697 --> 40:05.616
Jerry, come on, man!

40:05.657 --> 40:08.744
- Art, man! It's art!
- What do you know about art?

40:08.785 --> 40:11.079
Take a look at the future, old man!

40:11.121 --> 40:13.415
We're things to come!

40:13.457 --> 40:15.626
Here's art.

40:16.793 --> 40:19.171
- There's your art!
- This is fucking great!

40:19.254 --> 40:23.050
- We'll never work in this town again.
- Quite a night.

40:23.133 --> 40:25.177
I'm Jac Holzman.

40:25.219 --> 40:27.888
- I own Elektra Records.
- Is that asshole gonna pay us?

40:30.182 --> 40:33.060
I think if you can put
what you did in there on record...

40:33.143 --> 40:35.854
we could really have something
and make a lot of money.

40:37.648 --> 40:39.691
Rothchild here
was born to be your producer.

40:39.775 --> 40:42.694
How you doing? Sorry about all this.
You guys are--

40:43.695 --> 40:46.657
Bertolt Brecht. It's cabaret.
It's rock and roll.

40:46.698 --> 40:48.700
I'm really blown away, guys.

40:48.784 --> 40:53.080
I'd like to get you guys
into a studio immediately.

40:53.163 --> 40:56.458
How would you like to come down
from there and make a record?

40:56.542 --> 40:59.419
Sure.
Pretty good. Pretty neat.

41:02.589 --> 41:04.550
Bruce, you feel it?

41:04.591 --> 41:07.094
It's bitchin'.

41:07.135 --> 41:11.640
An album of killer music in six days.
Six days, baby.

41:11.723 --> 41:13.433
Unreal.

41:13.475 --> 41:16.979
The time to hesitate is through

41:17.062 --> 41:20.941
No time to wallow in the mire

41:20.983 --> 41:24.194
Try now, we can only lose

41:24.278 --> 41:28.282
And our love become a funeral pyre

41:28.365 --> 41:31.034
Come on, baby, light my fire

41:35.831 --> 41:38.959
Try to set the night on fire

42:12.951 --> 42:15.037
L.B.J.! L.B.J.!

42:15.120 --> 42:18.040
How many kids
have you killed today?

42:24.087 --> 42:27.716
You know that it would be untrue

42:27.799 --> 42:31.595
You know that I would be a liar

42:31.637 --> 42:35.182
If I was to say to you

42:35.265 --> 42:38.727
Girl, we couldn't get much higher

42:38.810 --> 42:41.813
Come on, baby, light my fire

42:46.151 --> 42:49.446
Try to set the night on fire

43:04.670 --> 43:06.880
All right!

43:33.448 --> 43:36.410
- Name? Occupation?
- Bill Siddons. I'm the manager.

43:36.493 --> 43:37.870
I manage the Doors.

43:37.911 --> 43:42.457
- Name? Occupation?
- Pamela Morrison. Ornament.

43:42.541 --> 43:45.794
Robby Krieger.
Guitar player.

43:45.878 --> 43:48.255
John Densmore.
Percussionist.

43:48.297 --> 43:51.300
Twenty-two years old.
Far out, man.

43:52.843 --> 43:54.845
- Name? Occupation?
- Raymond Daniel Manzarek.

43:54.928 --> 43:59.224
Born 2-12-39.
Musician. Organist.

43:59.308 --> 44:02.519
- Name? Occupation?
- Jim.

45:09.086 --> 45:11.046
We're gonna be on TV.

45:11.129 --> 45:12.714
Right this way, Mr. Sullivan.

45:12.798 --> 45:14.967
They're called the Doors...

45:15.050 --> 45:17.928
and they've got the number one single
in the country right now.

45:17.970 --> 45:19.930
"Light Your Fire."

45:21.306 --> 45:23.308
Now, they're not your usual group...

45:23.350 --> 45:25.811
but I think they're gonna fit in
just fine.

45:25.894 --> 45:27.729
Everything's gonna be fine.

45:27.813 --> 45:30.858
The riot continues in Detroit,
with 1,400 buildings burned.

45:30.899 --> 45:32.568
No wonder "Light My Fire"
is number one.

45:34.069 --> 45:36.613
So, what's your room number?

45:36.697 --> 45:38.365
I'll talk to you later.

45:38.407 --> 45:42.286
- You have got very serious hair.
- Were you pinching her butt?

45:42.369 --> 45:46.206
- What about me?
- I won't open that kettle of worms.

45:46.290 --> 45:48.208
What about you, handsome?
What can we do?

45:48.292 --> 45:50.794
Some of the worst mistakes of my life
have been haircuts.

45:50.878 --> 45:54.256
Don't wash it. Don't set it. Go away.
I like it just the way it is.

45:54.339 --> 45:57.718
- Be mean.
- Boys. Boys.

45:57.801 --> 45:59.761
Meet Mr. Sullivan.

45:59.845 --> 46:02.055
Fellas, just great.

46:02.097 --> 46:04.933
- I heard your record, "Light That Fire."
- "Light Your Fire."

46:05.017 --> 46:06.602
- Just--
- "Light My Fire."

46:06.685 --> 46:09.271
Fine.
Just really, really fine.

46:09.313 --> 46:11.732
I have one small thing to bring up.

46:11.773 --> 46:14.526
But it's important.
The guys at network told us...

46:14.610 --> 46:16.528
they have a little problem...

46:16.612 --> 46:20.032
with the lyric,
"Girl, we couldn't get much higher."

46:20.115 --> 46:22.159
You can't say "higher"...

46:22.242 --> 46:23.702
on network.

46:23.785 --> 46:25.579
They asked if you could say, instead...

46:25.621 --> 46:28.040
"Girl, we can't get much better."

46:28.123 --> 46:30.125
- Can you dig that?
- How about...

46:30.209 --> 46:33.837
"Girl, you couldn't bite my wire"?

46:35.130 --> 46:37.591
I don't think
Standards and Practices would--

46:37.674 --> 46:41.512
Why don't you have a nice, big smile
on your face when you get out there?

46:41.595 --> 46:43.347
There's no point in being sullen.

46:43.388 --> 46:46.141
- You know what I mean?
- We're a sullen group, Ed.

46:46.183 --> 46:51.605
You boys should know, Mr. Sullivan
is considering you for four more shows.

46:51.688 --> 46:53.023
- You dig?
- We dig.

46:53.065 --> 46:56.401
I'll work it out.
Just give me five minutes.

46:56.485 --> 46:58.403
- Groovy.
- Just give me five.

46:58.487 --> 47:00.531
Have a great show.

47:05.410 --> 47:06.495
Well?

47:07.287 --> 47:11.083
- Come on.
- It's just a word.

47:11.166 --> 47:13.669
The Stones changed
when they played here.

47:13.752 --> 47:15.796
Why don't you change your name to...

47:15.921 --> 47:18.298
Sidney or lrving Manzarek?

47:18.382 --> 47:20.425
- It's just a word.
- Hey, man.

47:20.551 --> 47:23.053
My words. I don't care.
Let's just jam.

47:23.136 --> 47:24.388
And now...

47:24.471 --> 47:26.932
direct from
Los Angeles, California...

47:27.057 --> 47:30.561
ladies and gentlemen,
here now, the Doors!

47:33.480 --> 47:35.816
You know that it would be untrue

47:35.941 --> 47:37.860
We're okay sound wise?

47:40.404 --> 47:44.533
If I was to say to you

47:44.616 --> 47:48.078
Girl, we couldn't get much higher

47:48.161 --> 47:49.830
He said it!

47:49.913 --> 47:51.331
He said it on national TV.

47:51.456 --> 47:55.085
- I can't believe that!
- Come on baby, light my fire

47:55.169 --> 47:56.837
What's he doing? What's that?

47:56.920 --> 47:59.673
Jesus! Get it off!
You can see his thing!

47:59.756 --> 48:01.800
You blew it, you little shit!

48:01.842 --> 48:03.802
You'll never play Sullivan again!

48:08.849 --> 48:12.144
Can you just move a step forward?

48:12.186 --> 48:14.688
Come on.
I know you love to look at yourself.

48:16.231 --> 48:18.192
Great.

48:19.735 --> 48:23.071
Let's try something different.
Take your shirt off.

48:24.072 --> 48:26.825
- You take it off.
- Do you need help?

48:28.994 --> 48:30.913
That's good.

48:32.915 --> 48:36.418
The camera
is whatever you want it to be.

48:36.460 --> 48:38.170
A woman you want to seduce.

48:39.630 --> 48:42.049
A man you want to kill.

48:42.090 --> 48:44.885
It can be anything you want.

48:44.927 --> 48:46.595
That's nice.

48:48.096 --> 48:49.598
That's great!

48:49.681 --> 48:52.392
Do you have any idea
what these pictures can do?

48:52.434 --> 48:56.188
One image controls millions of people.

48:56.271 --> 48:58.857
- Where are the Doors?
- Right here.

48:58.941 --> 49:00.317
Will you forget the Doors?

49:00.359 --> 49:02.110
You're the one they want.

49:02.152 --> 49:04.321
You are the Doors.
Come on.

49:06.114 --> 49:07.658
That's it.
Be ugly.

49:09.743 --> 49:11.662
I love that.

49:11.745 --> 49:13.455
Anything you want.

49:13.497 --> 49:15.624
There are no restrictions here.

49:18.836 --> 49:20.504
Look at yourself.

49:20.546 --> 49:22.506
Fall in love with yourself.

49:24.758 --> 49:27.719
You're your own audience now.

49:29.263 --> 49:31.223
They want you.

49:32.432 --> 49:35.894
Worship, love you.

49:35.936 --> 49:37.479
Adore you.

49:37.563 --> 49:40.482
Jim Morrison.

49:40.566 --> 49:42.484
The god of rock...

49:42.568 --> 49:44.486
and cock.

50:23.984 --> 50:27.154
Not tonight, Edie.
Thank you, not tonight.

50:27.196 --> 50:30.240
This is the fun part of my job.
This is history in the making.

50:30.324 --> 50:34.870
Would you like to see my imitation
of a shrimp?

50:34.953 --> 50:37.039
Let me put it this way.

50:37.080 --> 50:40.501
Andy is more than an artist.
Andy Warhol is art.

50:40.542 --> 50:43.754
Sometimes I think bright people
in America must ask themselves...

50:43.837 --> 50:46.924
"Does Andy imitate life,
or does life imitate Andy?"

50:47.007 --> 50:49.718
Jim, this is Tom Baker.

50:49.801 --> 50:53.096
He's in one of Andy's movies,
"I, A Man."

50:53.180 --> 50:55.766
- And this is Count "Ruspooli."
- Ruspoli.

50:55.849 --> 50:57.726
He's ltalian, but he lives in Paris.

50:57.768 --> 51:01.271
He's from a very famous family,
700 years old.

51:01.355 --> 51:04.191
Hi, Jim.
You are great.

51:04.233 --> 51:07.236
I see you at Ondine's with Hendrix.

51:07.277 --> 51:10.572
So cool.

51:10.614 --> 51:12.574
- All right.
- Don't you like the way he talks?

51:12.616 --> 51:15.118
- It's so cool.
- What's your trip?

51:15.202 --> 51:17.663
My trip?
I thought it was yours.

51:17.788 --> 51:20.749
I caught your gig at The Scene.
I thought it was pretty good.

51:20.832 --> 51:22.543
I liked it a lot.
It was hot.

51:22.626 --> 51:25.629
I like your movies, man.
You got a great penis.

51:28.632 --> 51:31.051
We're gonna split.
Why don't you come with us?

51:31.134 --> 51:34.680
- We're going to get a bite to eat.
- No, you can't leave.

51:34.805 --> 51:36.265
Where's your will to be weird?

51:36.306 --> 51:38.809
Look, that's Jim Morrison.

51:38.934 --> 51:40.519
I like the Doors.

51:40.644 --> 51:43.230
Let's get out of here.
These people are wacky.

51:44.481 --> 51:47.693
Come with me.
Andy's waiting for you.

51:47.776 --> 51:50.028
No, not now.
Let's do this later.

51:51.572 --> 51:53.532
Do you remember San Francisco?

51:53.574 --> 51:55.868
- No, not really.
- Have another joint.

51:55.951 --> 51:57.619
Check it out.

51:58.537 --> 52:01.915
This chick here sings with Andy's band,
The Velvet Underground.

52:01.999 --> 52:05.419
She says she can
drink you under the table.

52:07.838 --> 52:10.048
Hi, I'm Nico.

52:10.132 --> 52:12.551
It's so boring tonight.

52:14.386 --> 52:17.181
Some of us are going downtown
to a new club.

52:17.264 --> 52:19.099
You want to come?

52:19.224 --> 52:21.560
Elevate your taste in trolls, man.

52:24.438 --> 52:26.440
Vodka?

52:26.523 --> 52:28.442
I'll race you.

52:31.612 --> 52:33.488
Your death.

52:37.284 --> 52:40.037
Come on, man.
Let's go.

52:40.120 --> 52:42.706
All right.
We're gonna go to a club.

52:42.789 --> 52:45.834
I think this girl
wants to hang out with you.

52:45.918 --> 52:49.796
Don't you want to meet Andy Warhol?

52:49.838 --> 52:53.091
I could do without the guy.
He's a freak.

52:53.175 --> 52:54.885
Come on.
We got a big gig tomorrow.

52:54.968 --> 52:58.680
Wait. I thought we were going
to be a rock and roll band.

52:58.764 --> 53:01.225
All right.
The four of us.

53:01.308 --> 53:03.435
Come on.
This isn't our scene.

53:03.519 --> 53:05.187
These people are vampires.

53:09.024 --> 53:12.194
Come on, let's make the myths.
Remember?

53:12.236 --> 53:13.654
Let's go.

53:13.695 --> 53:15.405
Don't leave.

53:15.489 --> 53:17.741
Come on, you guys.
Not tonight.

53:17.824 --> 53:19.743
I don't know what'll happen.

53:21.036 --> 53:22.621
It might be death.

53:24.414 --> 53:26.333
It's not death, man.

53:26.416 --> 53:28.085
I'll see you tomorrow.

53:59.157 --> 54:00.826
Jimmy, this way.

54:00.909 --> 54:03.829
Andy's waiting. This way.
I'll take you to him.

54:03.912 --> 54:05.497
Hey, daddy.

54:06.540 --> 54:08.417
Jimmy, please.
Come on.

54:08.500 --> 54:10.419
Andy's waiting.
Come on.

54:12.838 --> 54:14.840
Hey, man.
How you doin'?

54:14.882 --> 54:16.967
All right.
How you doin', man?

54:17.009 --> 54:18.468
Great.

54:19.845 --> 54:21.763
Pretty good.
Pretty neat.

54:28.770 --> 54:33.400
There was this big show
in Philadelphia.

54:33.483 --> 54:34.902
Andy.

54:34.985 --> 54:37.070
There were so many
people there--

54:37.154 --> 54:40.741
This is Jim Morrison of
the world-famous Doors musical group.

54:40.824 --> 54:43.702
- Andy Warhol, of course.
- Hi. Wow.

54:43.744 --> 54:46.496
We really like your music.

54:46.580 --> 54:49.124
- How you doin', Andy?
- Oh, great.

54:49.208 --> 54:53.420
And there were so many people
at the show...

54:55.005 --> 54:57.674
the paintings
were getting crushed...

54:57.758 --> 55:01.803
and they had to
take them all down.

55:04.306 --> 55:06.141
Really, they were kind of...

55:07.601 --> 55:08.810
great.

55:08.852 --> 55:11.813
Just the walls.
You see, Andy was the art.

55:11.855 --> 55:14.566
You should do a show
with just bare walls.

55:14.650 --> 55:17.569
We'd really like to use you
in one of our movies, Jim.

55:17.653 --> 55:19.571
You're really such a beauty.

55:19.655 --> 55:23.742
Andy says someday everybody
will be famous for 15 days.

55:23.825 --> 55:25.827
He'd really be great,
wouldn't he?

55:28.956 --> 55:30.874
I mean...

55:34.336 --> 55:36.839
It's the singer,
not the song, right?

55:36.922 --> 55:38.841
It's the astronaut,
not the voyage.

55:42.135 --> 55:44.179
Somebody gave me this telephone.

55:44.221 --> 55:47.850
- I think it was Edie, wasn't it?
- Yeah, it was Edie.

55:49.351 --> 55:51.895
And she said that...

55:52.896 --> 55:54.815
I could talk to God with it...

55:54.898 --> 55:57.734
but I don't have anything to say.

55:58.569 --> 56:00.529
Here. This is for you.

56:05.534 --> 56:08.245
Now you can talk to God.

56:22.342 --> 56:24.219
Morrison.

56:24.303 --> 56:26.305
Come here.

56:45.490 --> 56:48.202
Darling, listen,
I pay the bills...

56:48.285 --> 56:50.871
so I can use any language
that I want.

56:50.954 --> 56:53.373
The guy wants to talk
to the bum.

56:55.167 --> 56:56.919
Check it out, brother.

58:29.386 --> 58:32.306
What are your songs about,
Mr. Morrison?

58:33.432 --> 58:36.560
Love, death, travel, revolt.

58:40.230 --> 58:42.482
We all write the songs.

58:42.566 --> 58:44.109
I'm interested in...

58:45.194 --> 58:48.363
chaos, disorder...

58:48.447 --> 58:51.450
especially activities which seem
to have no meaning, like this.

58:52.576 --> 58:56.538
How do you feel about being called
"the ultimate Barbie doll"?

58:56.622 --> 58:59.917
When you say something like that,
it's a shortcut to thinking.

59:01.293 --> 59:04.213
And do you think about
the dreadful reviews...

59:04.296 --> 59:06.215
your new poetry book has gotten?

59:06.298 --> 59:08.717
I guess they didn't understand.

59:08.800 --> 59:12.262
- Did you finance its publication?
- Have you bothered to read the poetry?

59:12.346 --> 59:16.266
You keep denying that nothing good
can come out of L.A.

59:16.350 --> 59:18.268
That's a rather
provincial attitude.

59:18.352 --> 59:21.355
- Do you believe in drugs?
- I believe in excess.

59:21.438 --> 59:24.107
Is alcohol considered part
of the shaman's wisdom?

59:24.191 --> 59:25.692
It's the American way.

59:25.776 --> 59:29.029
Every year we spend more money
on tobacco and alcohol...

59:29.112 --> 59:30.781
than we do on education.

59:30.864 --> 59:33.909
- On behalf of the British press--
- What about the future of the Doors?

59:33.992 --> 59:36.912
- That's just an excuse for free sex.
- How do you spend your money?

59:40.582 --> 59:45.003
I believe in a long, prolonged
derangement of the senses...

59:45.087 --> 59:47.214
to attain the unknown.

59:48.257 --> 59:50.759
Although I live
in the subconscious...

59:51.593 --> 59:54.555
our pale reason
hides the infinite from us.

59:56.056 --> 59:59.434
Are you, by any chance,
in a trance now?

01:00:02.396 --> 01:00:04.064
Do you hurt?

01:00:05.524 --> 01:00:06.984
What?

01:00:08.068 --> 01:00:10.237
What hurts you the most?

01:00:13.198 --> 01:00:16.159
What do your parents think
about what you're doing?

01:00:16.201 --> 01:00:18.245
Actually,
I don't remember being born.

01:00:18.328 --> 01:00:21.248
It must have happened
during one of my blackouts.

01:00:21.331 --> 01:00:23.959
They must have expressed
some feeling.

01:00:24.001 --> 01:00:27.963
Well, to tell you the truth,
they're not living anymore...

01:00:28.005 --> 01:00:31.133
so I really don't like
to talk about that.

01:00:32.092 --> 01:00:34.303
Could you tell us how they died?

01:00:38.849 --> 01:00:40.350
It was a...

01:00:41.435 --> 01:00:43.020
horrible car crash...

01:00:43.103 --> 01:00:44.563
in New Mexico...

01:00:44.646 --> 01:00:46.732
in the '50s.

01:00:46.857 --> 01:00:50.194
My father ran right into
a truckload of Navahos.

01:00:50.235 --> 01:00:51.320
They were...

01:00:53.405 --> 01:00:55.699
all over the highway, bleeding.

01:00:57.075 --> 01:01:00.412
Their souls, kind of
stirring in the breeze...

01:01:00.454 --> 01:01:02.122
just leapt into mine.

01:01:05.918 --> 01:01:07.419
I'm sorry.

01:01:08.921 --> 01:01:13.342
Mr. Krieger, do you really
consider Mr. Morrison a shaman?

01:01:42.579 --> 01:01:45.999
Don't worry about it.
It happens to other guys too.

01:01:47.167 --> 01:01:49.002
Wanna do some coke?

01:01:49.127 --> 01:01:51.004
It'll loosen you up.

01:01:51.129 --> 01:01:53.340
Sure. The new thing.

01:01:57.719 --> 01:01:58.846
Wow.

01:02:01.306 --> 01:02:02.558
How old is this?

01:02:03.684 --> 01:02:06.395
That's 14th century.

01:02:06.436 --> 01:02:09.273
- Witchcraft.
- It's a religion, you know.

01:02:09.356 --> 01:02:11.233
Witchcraft.

01:02:11.275 --> 01:02:13.443
Witches are
the protectors of the seasons...

01:02:14.319 --> 01:02:16.780
the goddesses of the grain...

01:02:16.864 --> 01:02:18.782
and when crossed...

01:02:20.325 --> 01:02:21.743
destroyers.

01:02:27.791 --> 01:02:29.751
You ever try drinking blood?

01:02:30.794 --> 01:02:32.796
What?

01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:35.215
It works, you know.

01:02:35.299 --> 01:02:38.218
Drink it at the right time
of the moon.

01:02:40.304 --> 01:02:43.932
They used to dance
in the forests naked.

01:02:43.974 --> 01:02:46.935
I think that's what
offended the Puritans...

01:02:46.977 --> 01:02:48.645
and led to the burnings.

01:02:50.063 --> 01:02:53.358
They were a sexual threat
to their male order...

01:02:53.442 --> 01:02:55.652
like the Bacchae.

01:02:55.736 --> 01:02:57.654
Five days a year,
for Dionysus...

01:02:57.738 --> 01:03:00.699
they used to wander the hills
of ancient Greece.

01:03:01.742 --> 01:03:04.119
The first witches.

01:03:04.203 --> 01:03:07.497
Clans of wild women...

01:03:08.582 --> 01:03:10.709
looting...

01:03:10.792 --> 01:03:12.002
fucking...

01:03:13.378 --> 01:03:15.214
eating animals raw...

01:03:16.298 --> 01:03:19.384
looking for Dionysus...

01:03:19.426 --> 01:03:21.386
to tear him...

01:03:21.428 --> 01:03:22.888
to pieces!

01:03:27.059 --> 01:03:29.019
Where do you get the blood?

01:03:31.730 --> 01:03:35.567
Blood is the rose
of mysterious union.

01:03:36.610 --> 01:03:38.570
Symbol of potency.

01:03:39.655 --> 01:03:42.574
- Now you.
- I can't cut myself.

01:03:42.616 --> 01:03:46.078
Don't be such a child.
If I do it, you have to do it.

01:03:50.958 --> 01:03:52.376
You do it.

01:05:01.445 --> 01:05:03.530
Come on, rock god.

01:05:03.614 --> 01:05:05.908
Fuck me.
Fuck me good.

01:05:26.512 --> 01:05:30.182
What do you want me to do?
What can I do, baby?

01:05:36.563 --> 01:05:38.982
- What's the matter?
- Will you die for me?

01:05:39.024 --> 01:05:42.319
What do you want me to do?

01:05:42.361 --> 01:05:45.197
Maybe I should see
a doctor or something.

01:05:46.573 --> 01:05:50.702
What do you think?
Someone from the Freudian philosophy?

01:05:53.413 --> 01:05:55.499
It happens to other guys too.

01:06:01.046 --> 01:06:02.965
You know, that's the irony.

01:06:05.926 --> 01:06:09.513
Teenage death girls
want my dick, not my words.

01:06:18.105 --> 01:06:20.524
It's not so complicated.

01:06:20.607 --> 01:06:22.484
It's just sex, you know.

01:06:22.609 --> 01:06:25.946
Never wake up
in a good mood again.

01:06:26.029 --> 01:06:29.283
It's the hours and the pressure.

01:06:29.366 --> 01:06:32.786
You do everything
like it's your last performance.

01:06:32.828 --> 01:06:35.914
We weren't built to last.
You never know.

01:06:35.998 --> 01:06:39.918
You're setting yourself up, you know.
You're setting yourself up.

01:06:41.503 --> 01:06:43.881
You're a poet, not a rock star.

01:06:44.965 --> 01:06:46.884
You really know what I am?

01:06:48.552 --> 01:06:52.639
- You know what poetry is?
- You don't belong on Ed Sullivan.

01:06:52.681 --> 01:06:54.641
Who am I?

01:06:56.143 --> 01:06:59.229
Where's the feast
they promised us?

01:06:59.313 --> 01:07:01.231
Where's the new wine?

01:07:03.066 --> 01:07:04.985
Dying on the vine.

01:07:09.573 --> 01:07:12.242
See, I lied to you.

01:07:17.372 --> 01:07:19.291
I loved fame.

01:07:19.374 --> 01:07:22.044
I do love fame.

01:07:28.759 --> 01:07:30.969
- Why are you doing this to me?
- 'Cause you're here.

01:07:31.053 --> 01:07:32.888
And that's gonna help?

01:07:34.056 --> 01:07:37.226
I don't have this problem
with anybody else.

01:07:37.309 --> 01:07:39.228
Suck it, honey.
Come on.

01:07:39.311 --> 01:07:41.313
- Fuck you.
- Where you goin'? Huh?

01:07:41.396 --> 01:07:43.315
Where do you think you're going?

01:07:44.566 --> 01:07:45.901
Love my girl!

01:07:45.984 --> 01:07:47.986
How many guys have you fucked?

01:07:48.028 --> 01:07:50.614
And how many dogs
have you fucked?

01:07:50.656 --> 01:07:53.492
You're the only one
who couldn't make it, you asshole!

01:07:53.534 --> 01:07:56.995
You are the only limp dick
in the lot!

01:07:59.831 --> 01:08:01.750
Will you die for me?

01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:05.420
- Answer me!
- Will you die for me?

01:08:05.504 --> 01:08:07.047
Sure.

01:08:07.089 --> 01:08:08.590
I'd die for anybody.

01:08:08.674 --> 01:08:12.219
Shut up in there!
I'm trying to sleep in here!

01:08:16.515 --> 01:08:18.140
- Will you die for me?
- Yes!

01:08:18.225 --> 01:08:19.560
I don't believe you!

01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:21.562
- Say it!
- Yes. Yes.

01:08:29.944 --> 01:08:31.904
I'm just a clown.

01:08:33.407 --> 01:08:34.825
Am I a clown?

01:08:41.582 --> 01:08:43.082
I need a home...

01:08:44.292 --> 01:08:45.919
a place to hide.

01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:49.131
I'm sorry.

01:08:49.214 --> 01:08:52.509
We're gonna fuck death away.
Come on.

01:08:54.803 --> 01:08:57.555
Let's fuck death away.
Come on, baby. All right.

01:09:02.310 --> 01:09:06.231
An ancient lunatic reigns
in the trees of the night.

01:09:22.413 --> 01:09:24.832
We've got
a serious problem here.

01:09:24.875 --> 01:09:27.836
The fire marshal
won't let this concert go on...

01:09:27.877 --> 01:09:30.881
unless you clear the aisles
and go back to your seats.

01:09:30.923 --> 01:09:34.259
Unless you clear these aisles,
there is no show.

01:09:34.343 --> 01:09:36.553
The sound of the crowd.

01:09:36.595 --> 01:09:39.723
I don't even like rock groups.
They're sleazy.

01:09:42.392 --> 01:09:44.310
- You like that, huh?
- Like Nuremberg.

01:09:44.394 --> 01:09:46.313
- Like that?
- We're Germans.

01:09:47.689 --> 01:09:49.608
- Beg.
- I'm begging.

01:09:50.859 --> 01:09:52.778
You wanna fuck me?

01:09:54.488 --> 01:09:56.949
Don't ever fuckin' lie
to me again.

01:09:56.990 --> 01:10:01.703
- About what?
- Why did you say your father was dead?

01:10:01.787 --> 01:10:04.164
He is dead.
Both of them. Totally.

01:10:04.248 --> 01:10:07.459
If he's so dead,
who answered the phone when I called?

01:10:07.543 --> 01:10:08.961
What?

01:10:10.671 --> 01:10:14.132
You didn't really think you were
getting away with that, did you?

01:10:14.216 --> 01:10:16.802
Your father's an admiral
in the Navy...

01:10:16.885 --> 01:10:20.806
who was at the Gulf of Tonkin
when the Vietnam War broke out.

01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:27.563
Wow.

01:10:27.688 --> 01:10:30.691
Your dad's deputy chief
of operations.

01:10:30.774 --> 01:10:33.277
Just don't ever lie to me again.

01:10:41.118 --> 01:10:42.536
What?

01:10:46.164 --> 01:10:47.708
You shouldn't have done that.

01:10:47.791 --> 01:10:51.211
Like it's so hard
to trace your school records?

01:10:51.295 --> 01:10:55.757
You went to University of Florida,
Albuquerque, New Mexico...

01:10:55.883 --> 01:10:58.385
Arlington, Virginia...

01:10:58.468 --> 01:11:00.554
Washington, D.C.

01:11:01.638 --> 01:11:04.558
You have a brother and a sister.

01:11:04.641 --> 01:11:08.061
"Seven Miles Long," baby.
It's all in "The End."

01:11:23.327 --> 01:11:24.661
I'm sorry.

01:11:25.746 --> 01:11:27.664
What did he do?

01:11:29.208 --> 01:11:31.168
Did he love you?

01:11:34.213 --> 01:11:36.006
How much?

01:11:41.011 --> 01:11:42.930
Your mama?

01:11:49.436 --> 01:11:52.356
Hatred's
a very underestimated emotion.

01:11:54.566 --> 01:11:56.860
Doesn't matter anymore, does it?

01:11:58.570 --> 01:12:02.032
Do you hear them out there?
Are you listening to them?

01:12:04.159 --> 01:12:06.078
It's you they want now.

01:12:07.788 --> 01:12:09.748
It's not the Doors.

01:12:10.916 --> 01:12:13.836
It's not your mother
or your father's child.

01:12:15.170 --> 01:12:16.588
It's you.

01:12:19.258 --> 01:12:22.470
They don't want me.
They want my death.

01:12:22.553 --> 01:12:24.472
Ripped to pieces.

01:12:26.224 --> 01:12:28.392
Patricia, just hold me.

01:12:31.395 --> 01:12:32.605
What you doin' there?

01:12:34.607 --> 01:12:36.192
- Nothin'.
- Okay, out.

01:12:36.234 --> 01:12:37.777
No one's allowed backstage.

01:12:37.860 --> 01:12:41.447
- Don't you know who this is?
- It's cool. I'm with the band.

01:12:41.530 --> 01:12:43.449
Let's go. Come on.

01:12:43.532 --> 01:12:45.660
- Cool it, pig.
- Fuckin' hippie!

01:12:46.577 --> 01:12:47.954
Motherfucker!

01:12:52.416 --> 01:12:53.834
They got Jim!

01:12:54.919 --> 01:12:56.587
What's happening?

01:12:56.629 --> 01:12:59.465
What the fuck is going on here?

01:13:00.550 --> 01:13:02.843
I'm blind!

01:13:02.927 --> 01:13:05.972
- He's under arrest.
- Don't shut your eyes, Jim!

01:13:07.557 --> 01:13:09.475
We gotta get you out.

01:13:10.601 --> 01:13:12.144
Leave him alone.

01:13:12.186 --> 01:13:15.648
- He doesn't need more shit in his life.
- What do you know what he needs?

01:13:23.531 --> 01:13:24.907
Fuck!

01:13:25.992 --> 01:13:27.410
All right

01:13:28.494 --> 01:13:30.037
Okay

01:13:31.247 --> 01:13:32.665
All right

01:13:39.964 --> 01:13:41.382
I am

01:13:43.551 --> 01:13:46.554
Your back door man

01:13:47.597 --> 01:13:49.307
"Light My Fire!"

01:13:51.392 --> 01:13:53.561
Men don't know

01:13:53.644 --> 01:13:57.023
Little girls understand

01:13:57.064 --> 01:13:59.233
Fire! "Light My Fire!"

01:14:02.403 --> 01:14:04.071
Well, all your people

01:14:05.197 --> 01:14:06.866
Tryin' to sleep

01:14:07.909 --> 01:14:09.869
I'm out there makin'

01:14:09.911 --> 01:14:12.580
Midnight creep

01:14:18.336 --> 01:14:20.254
Back door man

01:14:23.841 --> 01:14:26.093
Men don't know

01:14:26.135 --> 01:14:27.261
Little girls

01:14:27.929 --> 01:14:29.305
Understand

01:14:32.350 --> 01:14:34.435
All right, yeah

01:14:36.270 --> 01:14:37.647
Come on

01:14:57.667 --> 01:15:00.002
Persian night, babe

01:15:02.213 --> 01:15:04.799
See that light, babe

01:15:06.717 --> 01:15:08.886
Save us

01:15:11.180 --> 01:15:13.599
Jesus

01:15:15.893 --> 01:15:18.437
Save us

01:15:39.125 --> 01:15:42.044
I want to tell you about something
that happened a few minutes ago...

01:15:42.128 --> 01:15:44.547
right here in New Haven.

01:15:44.630 --> 01:15:47.592
This is New Haven, isn't it?
New Haven, Connecticut?

01:15:48.885 --> 01:15:51.262
United States of America?

01:15:52.346 --> 01:15:55.099
Is the West really the best...

01:15:55.182 --> 01:15:58.019
or are you just stoned on weed?

01:15:58.102 --> 01:16:00.354
Come on!
Sing "Light My Fire."

01:16:15.328 --> 01:16:17.830
I was with this girl backstage.

01:16:18.873 --> 01:16:21.542
We wanted some privacy...

01:16:21.626 --> 01:16:24.212
so we went into
this shower stall.

01:16:26.923 --> 01:16:29.842
We weren't doing anything.
We were just talking.

01:16:31.260 --> 01:16:33.804
All of the sudden this--

01:16:33.846 --> 01:16:36.098
this little man came in...

01:16:36.182 --> 01:16:39.685
with a little blue hat
and a little blue suit.

01:16:43.439 --> 01:16:46.108
He said,
"What you doin' in there?"

01:16:46.192 --> 01:16:48.069
I said, "Nothing."

01:16:48.861 --> 01:16:50.279
And he said...

01:16:50.363 --> 01:16:53.407
"Well, you'd better
get out of there or--"

01:16:53.491 --> 01:16:55.826
"Or what?" I said.

01:16:55.910 --> 01:16:57.828
And he started pushin' me.

01:16:59.580 --> 01:17:01.499
So I started pushin' back!

01:17:02.792 --> 01:17:04.293
He didn't like that.

01:17:10.716 --> 01:17:14.637
Then he reached behind
and pulled out a can of Mace...

01:17:16.973 --> 01:17:19.934
and sprayed it right in my eyes.

01:17:21.269 --> 01:17:22.937
Fuckin' blinded me!

01:17:24.647 --> 01:17:26.315
Why?

01:17:26.357 --> 01:17:30.027
All because I was alone
in a room with a girl...

01:17:30.111 --> 01:17:34.657
doing what he'd like to be doing if
he could only get it up without a gun.

01:17:34.699 --> 01:17:36.492
All right!

01:17:37.618 --> 01:17:40.454
In the United States
of America, man!

01:17:41.497 --> 01:17:44.166
Land of the free,
home of the brave!

01:17:44.250 --> 01:17:46.252
In God we trust!

01:17:52.675 --> 01:17:54.510
Say your thing, man.

01:17:54.552 --> 01:17:57.305
Mr. Morrison,
you've gone too far.

01:17:57.346 --> 01:17:59.515
The show's over.

01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:03.269
You've violated
state obscenity laws.

01:18:03.352 --> 01:18:05.855
- You're under arrest!
- There you go!

01:18:15.406 --> 01:18:17.366
Out of the way!

01:18:17.408 --> 01:18:20.036
Get out of the way!

01:18:25.207 --> 01:18:27.126
Back! Keep 'em back!

01:18:29.754 --> 01:18:32.215
Get your hands off me,
you slaves.

01:18:34.258 --> 01:18:37.261
This isn't happening to me, man.
It's happening to you.

01:18:44.602 --> 01:18:48.189
Let's just say I was testing
the bounds of reality.

01:18:48.272 --> 01:18:50.191
That's all.
I was curious.

01:18:51.776 --> 01:18:54.737
I always preferred
to be hated...

01:18:54.820 --> 01:18:57.949
like Erich von Stroheim
in the movies.

01:18:57.990 --> 01:19:00.034
The man you love to hate.

01:19:01.118 --> 01:19:03.913
It's meant to be ironic...

01:19:03.996 --> 01:19:06.874
like courage wants to laugh.

01:19:07.667 --> 01:19:10.586
Essentially, a stupid situation.

01:19:10.670 --> 01:19:13.714
I go out on the stage
and howl for people.

01:19:15.216 --> 01:19:19.178
In me they see exactly
what they wanna see.

01:19:20.388 --> 01:19:23.349
Some say "lizard king,"
whatever that means.

01:19:24.684 --> 01:19:26.644
Or some black-clad leather demon...

01:19:26.686 --> 01:19:28.646
whatever that means.

01:19:30.314 --> 01:19:32.775
But really, I think of myself...

01:19:33.943 --> 01:19:36.862
as a sensitive,
intelligent human being...

01:19:38.781 --> 01:19:42.285
but with the soul of a clown
that always forces me to blow it...

01:19:42.410 --> 01:19:44.829
at the most crucial moments.

01:19:52.670 --> 01:19:54.589
I'm a fake hero.

01:19:56.591 --> 01:19:59.427
A joke that God's played on me.

01:19:59.468 --> 01:20:01.262
Good morning.

01:20:01.345 --> 01:20:03.306
Pour me my breakfast, Dolores.

01:20:05.433 --> 01:20:08.561
What's the matter with Jimbo?
Can't handle it, eh?

01:20:08.644 --> 01:20:09.937
He's pussy-whipped.

01:20:10.021 --> 01:20:13.608
Hey, Jim, eat this, man.
We got one last place to go.

01:20:13.691 --> 01:20:15.610
Ray's getting married this morning.
Remember?

01:20:15.693 --> 01:20:17.278
"Alive, she cried."

01:20:17.403 --> 01:20:19.739
Can't eat that.
It'll make me sick.

01:20:19.822 --> 01:20:22.575
Give me a Dos Equis,
will you, Dolores.

01:20:22.658 --> 01:20:26.329
- And a Ramos fizz.
- What happened to you last night?

01:20:26.454 --> 01:20:30.666
You bet me $1,000 you were gonna
walk on the ledge of the 9000 building.

01:20:30.791 --> 01:20:31.959
Let's go right now.

01:20:32.001 --> 01:20:35.671
Complaining about going home
to your sanctuary.

01:20:35.713 --> 01:20:37.673
We were gonna make a movie.

01:20:39.008 --> 01:20:41.177
You bet me 1,000 bucks, man.

01:20:41.260 --> 01:20:43.804
- Give him a double.
- A triple.

01:20:43.846 --> 01:20:46.349
Imagine me and Morrison
in a movie together.

01:20:46.390 --> 01:20:48.684
Two powerful, two lrish...

01:20:48.768 --> 01:20:52.980
two-fisted fuckin' drinkin' guys
in the same movie together.

01:20:53.022 --> 01:20:54.482
I'll direct it.

01:20:54.523 --> 01:20:56.984
If Dennis Hopper can do it,
I can.

01:20:57.026 --> 01:21:00.988
We'll all three direct it.
A real road movie in black and white.

01:21:01.030 --> 01:21:02.990
We'll call it Zero.

01:21:05.034 --> 01:21:06.994
- What the fuck?
- Fuck you, Morrison!

01:21:07.036 --> 01:21:08.746
Get outta here!

01:21:08.788 --> 01:21:10.039
Fuckin' jack-off!

01:21:17.213 --> 01:21:19.131
Keep the drink.

01:21:20.716 --> 01:21:24.345
It's only another 95,000...

01:21:24.428 --> 01:21:28.516
but I could get the best clothes
from India, from Morocco, Jim.

01:21:28.599 --> 01:21:30.518
Clothes you couldn't get
anywhere else.

01:21:30.601 --> 01:21:34.313
Then we could get the richest
people to come-- Miles Davis...

01:21:34.397 --> 01:21:37.483
Sonny and Cher, the Stones.

01:21:37.567 --> 01:21:40.945
It could be the best boutique
on La Cienega, Jim.

01:21:41.028 --> 01:21:43.656
Why don't we have a car?

01:21:43.739 --> 01:21:46.409
- We lost it.
- Yeah, but...

01:21:46.450 --> 01:21:48.411
where's the gravy train?

01:21:53.249 --> 01:21:56.252
What's the matter with you?
What are you on?

01:21:56.335 --> 01:21:58.546
You said you wouldn't
drink today.

01:21:58.629 --> 01:22:01.340
No, Ma, I ain't drinkin'.

01:22:01.424 --> 01:22:05.177
You promised you wouldn't drink anymore.
You're not gonna drink, are you?

01:22:05.261 --> 01:22:06.929
No, Ma, I ain't.

01:22:07.013 --> 01:22:10.725
And you're gonna change those stinky
leathers you've worn for three weeks.

01:22:10.808 --> 01:22:13.185
I don't know about that.

01:22:13.227 --> 01:22:15.187
What are you on?

01:22:16.939 --> 01:22:19.984
It's just some low-grade acid.
It's not heavy.

01:22:20.026 --> 01:22:21.903
Oh, Jim!

01:22:21.986 --> 01:22:24.405
Oh, God! I cooked!

01:22:24.488 --> 01:22:26.532
- I cooked the duck!
- It's okay.

01:22:26.616 --> 01:22:28.910
People are coming, you know.

01:22:28.993 --> 01:22:32.121
Ray and Dorothy think
that we're flaky enough.

01:22:32.204 --> 01:22:36.042
You said we'd wait until after,
and now you're gonna peak before me.

01:22:36.083 --> 01:22:39.378
No, it's cool. We'll trip,
and then we'll eat our feast.

01:22:39.420 --> 01:22:41.214
Yeah, sure. No!

01:22:41.255 --> 01:22:44.926
You know, I think it's a good thing
about Ray and Dorothy.

01:22:45.009 --> 01:22:46.928
I do.

01:22:47.011 --> 01:22:49.013
Women are such noble creatures.

01:22:49.096 --> 01:22:52.350
They carry on your name
with dignity after you die.

01:22:54.977 --> 01:22:57.939
Are you saying you want to
marry me, Jim Morrison?

01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:05.071
I think women have a comic
approach to life. How can they not?

01:23:05.112 --> 01:23:08.699
They spend their lives
with that big dick seeking entry.

01:23:08.783 --> 01:23:10.451
Come on, Mom.

01:23:10.493 --> 01:23:14.622
I want to look inside,
like a spy.

01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:18.793
I'm a spy

01:23:18.876 --> 01:23:22.838
In the house of love

01:23:24.173 --> 01:23:27.635
I know the dream

01:23:28.844 --> 01:23:32.765
That you're dreamin' of

01:23:32.848 --> 01:23:36.269
I know the word

01:23:37.562 --> 01:23:41.732
That you long to hear

01:23:41.816 --> 01:23:46.362
I know your deepest

01:23:46.445 --> 01:23:49.240
Secret fear

01:23:50.825 --> 01:23:53.619
I know

01:23:53.703 --> 01:23:55.788
Everything

01:23:57.999 --> 01:24:00.418
I love it when you sing to me.

01:24:00.501 --> 01:24:01.544
That's 'cause...

01:24:02.378 --> 01:24:05.298
I'm the poet and you're my muse.

01:24:09.010 --> 01:24:11.888
"Lions in the street, roaming.

01:24:11.929 --> 01:24:15.099
Dogs in heat, rabid, foaming.

01:24:15.182 --> 01:24:18.936
A beast, caged in the heart
of the city, rotting...

01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:20.646
in the summer ground.

01:24:20.771 --> 01:24:22.064
He fled the town...

01:24:22.106 --> 01:24:24.609
left the chaos and disorder
back there--u

01:24:24.692 --> 01:24:27.069
Hey, everybody.
Here's the nuptial couple.

01:24:28.195 --> 01:24:31.115
What am I gonna do
about all these papers?

01:24:31.198 --> 01:24:32.783
- Get a drink.
- Jim.

01:24:34.118 --> 01:24:37.747
You really need somebody
to organize all this stuff.

01:24:37.830 --> 01:24:41.000
Your handwriting
is just like a little kid.

01:24:41.125 --> 01:24:45.254
Look at this. I wonder if William Blake
was ever this disorganized.

01:24:49.133 --> 01:24:52.261
- You're trying too hard.
- I'm gonna be your editor now.

01:24:52.345 --> 01:24:57.433
I'm gonna organize all this stuff
and take out all the "fuck" words.

01:24:57.516 --> 01:25:01.520
- Honey, you're trying too hard.
- No, I'm not.

01:25:01.604 --> 01:25:05.274
There's some great poetry here,
some wonderful ideas.

01:25:05.358 --> 01:25:06.859
Come on in!

01:25:08.527 --> 01:25:10.029
- Hey, Jimbo!
- Hey, man.

01:25:10.112 --> 01:25:12.907
Hi, baby.
How's it goin'?

01:25:13.991 --> 01:25:16.494
- Yo, Ray.
- Hey, Dog, how you doin'?

01:25:16.535 --> 01:25:20.248
- Get some drinks over there.
- What am I supposed to do?

01:25:22.833 --> 01:25:25.920
Who am I supposed to be
around all these people?

01:25:26.003 --> 01:25:27.338
Darling Pamela.

01:25:28.214 --> 01:25:30.132
I brought you something.

01:25:31.884 --> 01:25:33.886
You're my girl, that's who.

01:25:35.179 --> 01:25:37.098
I'm not your girl.

01:25:38.307 --> 01:25:42.436
I know you fuck everything
that touches you.

01:25:42.478 --> 01:25:44.981
- Don't give me that shit.
- Come on.

01:25:46.065 --> 01:25:48.609
I love my girl!
Listen, everybody!

01:25:48.651 --> 01:25:50.278
Pam and I--

01:25:51.362 --> 01:25:52.947
She's lookin' good.

01:25:52.989 --> 01:25:54.448
And to celebrate--

01:25:55.533 --> 01:25:57.451
- Hey, Patricia.
- Hi, Jim.

01:26:00.538 --> 01:26:02.456
Pam, have you met--

01:26:02.540 --> 01:26:03.791
Do you know--

01:26:03.833 --> 01:26:08.212
She wrote this great review
of my poetry book.

01:26:08.296 --> 01:26:11.966
- Let's go eat that turkey.
- Pam, let's set those plates.

01:26:12.049 --> 01:26:14.385
Are you Patricia Kennealy?

01:26:14.468 --> 01:26:15.970
You must be Pamela.

01:26:20.474 --> 01:26:22.852
You actually put your dick
in this woman?

01:26:24.437 --> 01:26:26.063
Well...

01:26:26.147 --> 01:26:27.648
sometimes, yeah.

01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:33.321
Well, I understand.
I really do.

01:26:33.362 --> 01:26:37.199
But don't ever expect that Jim's
gonna love you or take care of you...

01:26:37.283 --> 01:26:39.201
because you're one of a hundred.

01:26:39.285 --> 01:26:43.164
- You don't know when to stop.
- Look who's talking.

01:26:43.205 --> 01:26:47.418
Jim can make up his own mind
about who he loves and who he doesn't.

01:26:47.501 --> 01:26:48.920
Don't kid yourself, sweetheart.

01:26:49.003 --> 01:26:52.673
He's crazy, but not that crazy.
He loves me.

01:26:52.715 --> 01:26:54.675
Let's go check
those sweet potatoes.

01:26:54.717 --> 01:26:57.386
- There they go again.
- Chuck!

01:26:57.470 --> 01:27:00.723
Gonna be another one of those dinners?
You're gonna have to stop this.

01:27:00.806 --> 01:27:05.269
I'm glad you made it.
Jim, Robbie, meet Chuck Vincent.

01:27:07.939 --> 01:27:11.150
I just have one more thing
to say to you, Jim Morrison.

01:27:11.234 --> 01:27:14.111
You have ruined
another Thanksgiving.

01:27:14.195 --> 01:27:16.614
Bastard!
You killed my duck!

01:27:20.952 --> 01:27:23.287
You ruined my duck!

01:27:26.624 --> 01:27:28.626
What did you do to her?

01:27:28.709 --> 01:27:31.295
It's all right.
We're working it out.

01:27:31.337 --> 01:27:32.797
We'll work it out.

01:27:32.838 --> 01:27:34.799
It's okay.

01:27:41.305 --> 01:27:42.723
Fuck you!

01:27:53.859 --> 01:27:56.779
You want to know what murder is?

01:27:56.862 --> 01:27:58.781
You want a little death?

01:27:59.865 --> 01:28:01.117
Well, come on.

01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:03.411
You want a little death?

01:28:03.494 --> 01:28:07.039
Then kill me.
Go on, kill me. Come on.

01:28:08.165 --> 01:28:10.376
Kill me. Go on!

01:28:10.418 --> 01:28:12.712
Come on, give me some death!

01:28:15.256 --> 01:28:17.216
You killed my duck.

01:28:22.221 --> 01:28:25.182
And I'm still killing
your fucking duck.

01:28:25.224 --> 01:28:27.852
There! Murder! Death!

01:28:27.894 --> 01:28:29.395
Duck! Dead!

01:28:29.478 --> 01:28:31.105
Dead! Fucking dead!

01:28:31.188 --> 01:28:34.692
There! The duck is dead!

01:28:34.775 --> 01:28:37.737
- That's the incredible truth!
- Stop this shit! Get sane!

01:28:37.778 --> 01:28:40.197
Don't ever tell me what to do!

01:28:40.281 --> 01:28:42.325
- Yeah, fuck off, Ray.
- Fuck off, Ray.

01:28:44.744 --> 01:28:46.662
This party's gettin' low-rent.

01:28:46.746 --> 01:28:48.289
Let's split.

01:28:48.372 --> 01:28:50.333
Looks like we're not gonna eat.

01:28:50.458 --> 01:28:51.876
Shit.

01:28:53.711 --> 01:28:56.297
Fuck it.
Let's eat this thing.

01:28:56.422 --> 01:29:00.009
What happened to us, Daddy, huh?

01:29:03.179 --> 01:29:05.806
There was some
beautiful poetry, you know.

01:29:05.932 --> 01:29:07.350
Hold on, honey.

01:29:07.433 --> 01:29:09.644
There was some
beautiful poetry, Daddy.

01:29:21.364 --> 01:29:22.949
Action!

01:29:41.050 --> 01:29:43.010
Your mother's here
with your brother.

01:29:43.094 --> 01:29:46.764
I don't want to see 'em, okay?

01:29:46.889 --> 01:29:49.642
- What do you want me to do with 'em?
- You hear me?

01:29:49.725 --> 01:29:50.935
They're waiting!

01:29:52.019 --> 01:29:53.813
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:29:53.896 --> 01:29:56.107
from Los Angeles, California...

01:29:56.190 --> 01:29:58.401
the Doors!

01:29:58.484 --> 01:30:00.611
Pretty good.
Pretty neat.

01:30:25.344 --> 01:30:27.305
Not to touch the earth

01:30:27.346 --> 01:30:29.640
Not to see the sun

01:30:29.724 --> 01:30:33.227
Nothing left to do
but run, run, run

01:30:33.311 --> 01:30:34.228
Let's run

01:30:37.648 --> 01:30:39.442
Let's run

01:30:42.653 --> 01:30:44.697
House upon the hill

01:30:44.739 --> 01:30:46.782
Moon is lying still

01:30:46.866 --> 01:30:48.910
Shadows of the trees

01:30:48.993 --> 01:30:51.037
Witnessing the wild breeze

01:30:51.078 --> 01:30:53.831
Come on, baby, run with me

01:30:53.873 --> 01:30:55.625
Come on, honey.

01:30:55.708 --> 01:30:58.628
I been so lonely.
I miss my girl.

01:31:02.882 --> 01:31:05.509
I didn't realize
you were entertaining.

01:31:06.677 --> 01:31:09.096
I hope you are cool about this.

01:31:10.723 --> 01:31:13.142
Don't forget your smack
on the way out.

01:31:14.101 --> 01:31:15.770
The mansion is warm

01:31:15.853 --> 01:31:17.939
At the top of the hill

01:31:18.022 --> 01:31:20.942
Rich are the rooms
and the comforts there

01:31:21.776 --> 01:31:23.152
Red are the arms

01:31:23.236 --> 01:31:25.071
Of luxuriant chairs

01:31:25.112 --> 01:31:29.325
And you won't know a thing
'til you get inside here

01:31:35.623 --> 01:31:38.292
Yeah? Looking for a place
to hide, or to die?

01:31:38.376 --> 01:31:41.587
Just doing my thing,
like you said.

01:31:42.463 --> 01:31:44.882
- What?
- You're hurting me.

01:31:44.966 --> 01:31:46.217
Are you in pain?

01:31:46.300 --> 01:31:49.220
Let me introduce you
to my friend pain.

01:31:51.806 --> 01:31:53.558
Fuck you.

01:31:53.641 --> 01:31:56.727
Oh, sanctuary.
Looking for a place to hide?

01:31:56.811 --> 01:31:59.730
- I'll give you a place to hide.
- From you, you pig.

01:31:59.814 --> 01:32:01.732
Forever.

01:32:04.819 --> 01:32:07.738
Hey, honey, this is
the best part of the trip.

01:32:08.990 --> 01:32:10.741
Sanctuary.

01:32:10.825 --> 01:32:13.494
Come on, baby.
Come on, honey.

01:32:14.537 --> 01:32:15.788
Almost home.

01:32:18.958 --> 01:32:21.002
We're almost home, baby.

01:32:35.975 --> 01:32:37.059
Help!

01:32:37.143 --> 01:32:39.729
- It's blinding me.
- Help! I'm blind!

01:32:41.898 --> 01:32:42.982
That's better.

01:32:44.317 --> 01:32:45.902
Ride 'em, cowboy!

01:32:46.694 --> 01:32:48.613
- Look out.
- What?

01:32:48.696 --> 01:32:50.615
- There's a cop. Slow down.
- Where?

01:32:50.698 --> 01:32:52.825
Right there in front!
Look!

01:32:55.244 --> 01:32:58.706
Dead president's corpse
in the driver's car

01:32:58.789 --> 01:33:03.044
The engine runs on glue and tar

01:33:03.127 --> 01:33:06.714
Come on along Not goin' very far

01:33:06.797 --> 01:33:10.635
To the East
to meet the czar, yeah

01:33:17.391 --> 01:33:20.311
By a right line, the running line,
the crooked and the straight...

01:33:20.394 --> 01:33:21.979
I summon you up.

01:33:22.104 --> 01:33:27.318
By wood and stone, wind and fire,
land and water, I bring you in.

01:33:27.401 --> 01:33:30.655
We worship the ancient forces
of nature.

01:33:30.696 --> 01:33:33.074
The Great Mother,
the Triple Goddess...

01:33:33.157 --> 01:33:35.618
and the Horned One,
god of the hunt.

01:33:36.702 --> 01:33:38.162
Death does not part...

01:33:38.287 --> 01:33:40.331
only lack of love.

01:33:40.456 --> 01:33:42.124
The goddess holds the vow forever.

01:33:43.542 --> 01:33:45.294
Run with me

01:33:47.088 --> 01:33:49.006
Run with me

01:33:54.178 --> 01:33:55.304
Let's run

01:35:13.716 --> 01:35:17.220
The outlaws live
by the side of the lake

01:35:17.303 --> 01:35:20.556
The minister's daughter's
in love with a snake

01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:24.727
Who lives in a well
by the side of the road

01:35:24.769 --> 01:35:28.564
Wake up, girl
We're almost home, yeah

01:35:32.485 --> 01:35:34.904
We could see the gates
by morning

01:35:38.991 --> 01:35:41.994
We should be inside by evening

01:35:45.665 --> 01:35:47.959
Sun, sun, sun

01:35:52.338 --> 01:35:53.965
Moon, moon, moon

01:35:58.052 --> 01:36:01.347
I will gain you

01:36:01.430 --> 01:36:03.182
Soon

01:36:18.406 --> 01:36:20.491
I am the lizard king.

01:36:22.159 --> 01:36:24.495
I can do anything.

01:37:01.282 --> 01:37:05.578
Come on, come on, come on
Come on now, touch me, babe

01:37:05.620 --> 01:37:09.749
Can't you see
that I am not afraid

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.961
What was that promise
that you made

01:37:15.296 --> 01:37:19.425
Why won't you tell me
what she said

01:37:21.052 --> 01:37:24.680
Fuckin' Neanderthal prima donna.
Too drunk to fuckin' sing.

01:37:24.764 --> 01:37:28.643
I'm gonna love you

01:37:28.684 --> 01:37:33.439
'Til the heavens stop the rain

01:37:33.481 --> 01:37:37.318
I'm gonna love you

01:37:37.401 --> 01:37:41.822
'Til the stars fall from the sky

01:37:41.864 --> 01:37:43.491
You and I

01:37:43.574 --> 01:37:45.493
Cut. Cut.

01:37:46.786 --> 01:37:50.331
Terrific take, Jim. We just had
a technical problem in here.

01:37:50.414 --> 01:37:52.792
What's his fuckin' problem, man?

01:37:52.833 --> 01:37:55.545
- Paul, babe.
- Yeah, right here, babe.

01:37:55.628 --> 01:37:57.922
Suck a fart out of my asshole...

01:37:58.005 --> 01:38:00.132
you slave-driving fascist--

01:38:03.886 --> 01:38:06.847
- I hear the booze, the smoke.
- Sixty-seven takes?

01:38:06.889 --> 01:38:10.101
- I don't hear your voice or the song.
- Because it's stale!

01:38:10.184 --> 01:38:12.103
- "Stale"?
- I wanna do my thing!

01:38:12.186 --> 01:38:15.314
We'll do 167 takes
until it sounds like music.

01:38:15.398 --> 01:38:19.402
Let's do something else.
You're all a bunch of fuckin' slaves.

01:38:19.527 --> 01:38:21.070
Let's do--

01:38:21.153 --> 01:38:23.447
Come on, come on, come on.

01:38:23.531 --> 01:38:24.991
Rock is dead.

01:38:25.074 --> 01:38:28.494
Everybody come out here.
We'll do a sing-along.

01:38:28.578 --> 01:38:31.581
O come, all ye faithful

01:38:31.622 --> 01:38:34.584
- Get this circus outta here.
- It's too self-conscious.

01:38:35.751 --> 01:38:39.171
Billy, get 'em out!
You, you, you! Let's go!

01:38:39.255 --> 01:38:41.215
You deaf? Beat it!
Let's go!

01:38:41.257 --> 01:38:42.633
See you later.

01:38:43.759 --> 01:38:45.678
What are you doing, Jim?

01:38:45.761 --> 01:38:49.098
I'm sitting in
that fuckin' booth for months.

01:38:49.223 --> 01:38:52.894
I look out of the glass,
I see Jim, I hear Jim...

01:38:52.977 --> 01:38:55.187
but I miss him.

01:38:55.313 --> 01:38:59.191
And he's standing right in front of me.
How do you explain that?

01:39:01.193 --> 01:39:04.196
Don't make me go through
this whole shit again...

01:39:04.322 --> 01:39:07.658
watching Janis dive to the bottom
of a bottle of Southern Comfort.

01:39:07.742 --> 01:39:10.244
I won't go through it again.

01:39:11.329 --> 01:39:13.247
Why are you fucking this up?

01:39:16.918 --> 01:39:21.130
I love you, man.
You're my own flesh and blood.

01:39:24.926 --> 01:39:26.677
Catchy tune.

01:39:27.678 --> 01:39:29.597
You sold it to a commercial?

01:39:35.186 --> 01:39:37.146
- How much?
- Seventy-five thousand.

01:39:37.230 --> 01:39:39.565
We couldn't reach you.
We figured--

01:39:39.607 --> 01:39:43.194
- What is this shit, Ray?
- It's not a big deal, man.

01:39:43.236 --> 01:39:45.196
The song has already
been commercialized.

01:39:45.238 --> 01:39:47.698
Feliciano's already sold
two million copies.

01:39:49.075 --> 01:39:51.953
Robbie thought it was a good idea.
So did John.

01:39:52.036 --> 01:39:53.287
So did l.

01:39:54.372 --> 01:39:55.790
Robbie?

01:39:58.918 --> 01:40:01.379
Where were you?
You should've been here.

01:40:03.798 --> 01:40:07.718
Do you know what you're saying
to millions of people?

01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:12.431
The Doors-- all for one,
one for all-- not real.

01:40:15.017 --> 01:40:17.770
It's not about money...

01:40:17.812 --> 01:40:19.772
or records or success...

01:40:19.814 --> 01:40:21.774
or these...

01:40:21.816 --> 01:40:23.901
desires that you have.

01:40:23.985 --> 01:40:25.903
It's about...

01:40:27.196 --> 01:40:29.282
using the music to break through.

01:40:29.323 --> 01:40:31.284
Wasn't it, Ray?

01:40:33.828 --> 01:40:35.288
I don't know.

01:40:36.956 --> 01:40:38.874
We lost something here, man.

01:40:38.958 --> 01:40:40.877
I don't think so, Jim.

01:40:42.003 --> 01:40:44.672
There's just a bigger picture,
that's all.

01:40:44.714 --> 01:40:46.340
Yeah?

01:40:46.424 --> 01:40:47.800
In your fucking face!

01:40:49.760 --> 01:40:51.971
Jesus Fuckin' Christ!

01:40:52.013 --> 01:40:54.181
What the fuck is goin' on, man?

01:40:56.809 --> 01:40:58.561
Just kidding.

01:40:59.687 --> 01:41:01.606
Oh, hi, honey.

01:41:03.149 --> 01:41:06.068
We were just watching
a little TV.

01:41:06.152 --> 01:41:09.155
I wanted you to find us, Jim.
It meant nothing.

01:41:13.075 --> 01:41:15.369
You don't have to torture me.

01:41:15.411 --> 01:41:18.372
Just let me make it up to you.

01:41:25.755 --> 01:41:27.423
I love you.

01:41:27.506 --> 01:41:30.218
It's gonna be all right.

01:41:30.259 --> 01:41:31.719
You're the one.

01:41:32.845 --> 01:41:34.764
- Really?
- You're my girl.

01:41:37.350 --> 01:41:40.269
So vulnerable about everything,
it makes me sad.

01:41:41.604 --> 01:41:44.899
All right, let's keep
that money machine rolling.

01:41:50.571 --> 01:41:53.741
Can you find me

01:41:53.824 --> 01:41:56.953
Soft asylum

01:41:56.994 --> 01:42:00.456
I can't make it

01:42:00.498 --> 01:42:02.833
Anymore

01:42:02.917 --> 01:42:04.835
The man is

01:42:04.919 --> 01:42:09.382
At the door

01:42:14.011 --> 01:42:16.097
This is the trip, the best part...

01:42:16.180 --> 01:42:18.099
I really like.

01:42:21.352 --> 01:42:25.231
Yeah, I'm proud to be
a part of this number!

01:42:28.401 --> 01:42:32.196
Successful hills
are here to stay

01:42:33.406 --> 01:42:36.742
Everything must be this way

01:42:38.119 --> 01:42:41.747
All our lives we sweat and save

01:42:42.957 --> 01:42:46.586
Buildin' for a shallow grave

01:42:49.589 --> 01:42:53.593
The soft parade has now begun

01:42:54.760 --> 01:42:57.013
Cobra on my left

01:42:57.096 --> 01:43:00.766
Leopard on my right, yeah

01:43:03.519 --> 01:43:05.521
Come on

01:43:06.606 --> 01:43:11.068
And it's getting harder

01:43:11.152 --> 01:43:13.654
Callin' on the dogs

01:43:13.779 --> 01:43:15.698
When all else fails

01:43:15.781 --> 01:43:18.868
We can whip the horses' eyes

01:43:18.993 --> 01:43:21.996
And make them sleep

01:43:22.079 --> 01:43:23.664
And cry

01:43:26.667 --> 01:43:28.586
I love you.

01:43:34.550 --> 01:43:36.677
Hate your next-door neighbor

01:43:36.802 --> 01:43:39.222
But don't forget to say grace and

01:43:39.347 --> 01:43:42.141
Tell me over and over

01:43:42.225 --> 01:43:45.728
And over and over again, my friend

01:43:45.811 --> 01:43:48.147
You don't believe

01:43:48.189 --> 01:43:52.318
We're on the eve of destruction

01:43:53.861 --> 01:43:56.197
A hot night in Miami, March '69.

01:43:56.280 --> 01:43:58.532
Every space in the auditorium
is consumed.

01:43:58.616 --> 01:44:01.786
Unfortunately, The Doors have long
since sold out. They've become an act.

01:44:01.869 --> 01:44:05.164
Morrison falls off the stage
at least every other performance.

01:44:05.248 --> 01:44:09.001
"The Soft Parade" album only confirms
the plasticity of their approach.

01:44:09.085 --> 01:44:11.462
Songs like "Touch Me"
and "Tell All the People"...

01:44:11.546 --> 01:44:13.589
are not the Doors we once knew.

01:44:13.631 --> 01:44:16.050
So the question is:
why am I here?

01:44:16.092 --> 01:44:18.511
Are funerals entertainment?

01:44:18.594 --> 01:44:21.264
- He's not going to show.
- Show time is show time.

01:44:21.305 --> 01:44:24.183
This guy's done it to us too many times.
We should go on without him.

01:44:24.267 --> 01:44:27.812
Bill is with him. They're an hour away.
He'll get him here, all right?

01:44:27.895 --> 01:44:31.274
He fucking better
get him here, man.

01:44:31.357 --> 01:44:33.943
- Hey, he'll be here.
- I'll tell you one goddamn thing.

01:44:34.026 --> 01:44:36.696
There's gonna be a show here tonight
if I gotta throw a wig on, man...

01:44:36.779 --> 01:44:38.406
and sing them songs myself.

01:44:38.447 --> 01:44:40.741
Yeah, fuck off.

01:44:40.783 --> 01:44:43.452
How's it going?

01:44:43.494 --> 01:44:45.871
- Hey, dude.
- Yo, Jimbo.

01:44:45.955 --> 01:44:48.457
- Clean up your act.
- You asshole.

01:44:48.499 --> 01:44:51.294
I love you!
Hey, listen, Paul.

01:44:51.335 --> 01:44:53.337
- Can you get us some heroin?
- No.

01:44:53.379 --> 01:44:56.215
Why not? Some heroin.

01:44:56.299 --> 01:44:58.134
I am not gonna participate
in anything...

01:44:58.175 --> 01:45:00.636
that's gonna help you
accomplish your goal, Jim.

01:45:00.678 --> 01:45:02.805
What's my goal, Paul?

01:45:03.639 --> 01:45:07.351
Your only friend, the end

01:45:07.393 --> 01:45:11.731
Wrong. I just want to
sing the blues, man.

01:45:11.814 --> 01:45:15.735
Get fat, do nothin', go nowhere.
Just be.

01:45:15.818 --> 01:45:17.528
With that waistline,
you ain't got much choice.

01:45:17.612 --> 01:45:20.197
What is wrong with being
a large mammal?

01:45:20.239 --> 01:45:24.368
- A big beast, like a tank.
- You're king crawling flab.

01:45:24.410 --> 01:45:26.579
Rock is cock, baby,
and your rock is dying.

01:45:26.662 --> 01:45:30.583
Rock is death, man.
There's no longer belief.

01:45:30.625 --> 01:45:32.752
I'll write poetry...

01:45:32.835 --> 01:45:35.338
and direct movies.

01:45:35.421 --> 01:45:36.672
That's bullshit.

01:45:36.756 --> 01:45:39.926
You tested all the limits--
fame, fucking...

01:45:40.009 --> 01:45:41.260
money.

01:45:41.344 --> 01:45:43.888
What you gonna do
when the music's over, man...

01:45:43.930 --> 01:45:47.225
when you're too fat and old
to go out onstage?

01:45:47.266 --> 01:45:51.270
What you gonna do for act three?
Puke on heaven's door?

01:45:51.354 --> 01:45:53.856
Listen, you two-bit fucking actor.

01:45:53.940 --> 01:45:55.942
You underestimate the audience.

01:45:56.025 --> 01:45:58.486
Face it, Jim.
You're not gonna be remembered.

01:45:58.569 --> 01:46:01.322
You think all they want is...

01:46:01.405 --> 01:46:04.492
two cars and a house.

01:46:04.575 --> 01:46:05.952
But you're wrong.

01:46:05.993 --> 01:46:07.954
- You know what they want?
- No. Tell me.

01:46:08.037 --> 01:46:11.374
- You really want to know?
- Yeah, tell me. What?

01:46:11.457 --> 01:46:14.168
Something sacred.

01:46:14.210 --> 01:46:16.504
That's what they want.

01:46:16.546 --> 01:46:18.381
Something sacred.

01:46:24.512 --> 01:46:27.265
- He's two hours late!
- Where the fuck are the seats?

01:46:27.348 --> 01:46:30.518
- I took them out.
- How are you doin'?

01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:32.061
I'd like you to meet
my new friend.

01:46:32.144 --> 01:46:34.624
- You're not playing, huh?
- We're gonna sue your fucking ass.

01:46:34.689 --> 01:46:38.568
So sue me. If you ain't playing,
see where your equipment is tomorrow.

01:46:38.651 --> 01:46:41.011
I'm not going out there until
I get some sort of guarantee.

01:46:41.988 --> 01:46:44.865
Come on, John. How will you know
what could have been?

01:46:44.907 --> 01:46:47.410
How will you know
unless you break on through?

01:46:47.493 --> 01:46:49.370
Fucking asshole!

01:46:49.412 --> 01:46:51.205
You're pushing death, Morrison.

01:46:51.289 --> 01:46:53.207
People think we're drug addicts
because of you.

01:46:53.291 --> 01:46:56.878
- Are we the Beatles now, John?
- We took drugs to expand our mind.

01:46:56.961 --> 01:46:59.589
- Not to escape.
- Get him on the fucking stage!

01:46:59.672 --> 01:47:01.632
Listen.

01:47:01.716 --> 01:47:04.010
Have you ever eaten human flesh?

01:47:04.093 --> 01:47:07.889
'Cause I know this chick
in New York, man.

01:47:07.930 --> 01:47:09.932
Hey, it's cool.

01:47:09.974 --> 01:47:12.435
Listen, listen.

01:47:14.270 --> 01:47:17.064
Just one more time,
for old times' sake.

01:47:17.106 --> 01:47:20.192
- I don't want any.
- You'll play like an orgasm.

01:47:20.276 --> 01:47:22.236
Trust me.

01:47:26.991 --> 01:47:28.993
You said you loved pain.

01:47:29.118 --> 01:47:31.704
You run from it
every chance you get.

01:47:34.916 --> 01:47:37.376
Doors! Doors! Doors!

01:48:02.568 --> 01:48:04.779
Are you ready?

01:48:17.750 --> 01:48:19.669
Back off!

01:48:20.795 --> 01:48:23.381
I don't want to see
any more of that shit!

01:48:23.464 --> 01:48:25.967
I'll haul your ass in, pal.

01:48:28.010 --> 01:48:30.471
Hey, Jim!

01:48:38.563 --> 01:48:41.566
Five to one, baby

01:48:41.607 --> 01:48:44.443
One in five

01:48:44.527 --> 01:48:49.949
No one here gets out alive now

01:48:50.032 --> 01:48:52.785
You get yours, baby

01:48:52.868 --> 01:48:54.912
I'll get mine

01:48:56.205 --> 01:49:00.084
Gonna make it, baby if we try

01:49:11.762 --> 01:49:14.265
The old get older

01:49:14.348 --> 01:49:17.852
The young get stronger

01:49:17.935 --> 01:49:23.357
May take a week
and it may take longer

01:49:23.399 --> 01:49:28.779
They got the guns
but we got the numbers

01:49:29.530 --> 01:49:33.701
Gonna win, yeah
We're takin' over

01:49:33.743 --> 01:49:36.370
Come on!

01:49:36.412 --> 01:49:38.706
Let me hear ya!

01:50:00.311 --> 01:50:02.813
Look at this beautiful
living thing, man.

01:50:02.897 --> 01:50:05.358
You wouldn't eat
my little friend, would you?

01:50:05.441 --> 01:50:07.360
Come on, man.

01:50:07.443 --> 01:50:10.404
Love animals.
Don't eat them!

01:50:10.446 --> 01:50:12.281
I'd fuck her, but she's too young.

01:50:22.959 --> 01:50:25.294
Your ballroom days

01:50:25.378 --> 01:50:29.215
Are over, baby

01:50:29.298 --> 01:50:32.426
Night is drawing near

01:50:34.720 --> 01:50:38.599
Shadows of the evening

01:50:40.226 --> 01:50:43.938
Crawl across the year

01:50:44.021 --> 01:50:47.024
You walk across the floor

01:50:47.108 --> 01:50:49.860
With a flower in your hand

01:50:51.279 --> 01:50:55.783
Trying to tell me
no one understands

01:50:55.866 --> 01:50:58.119
Trade in your house

01:50:58.202 --> 01:51:02.081
For a handful of dimes

01:51:02.164 --> 01:51:04.375
Gonna make it, baby

01:51:04.417 --> 01:51:07.879
In our prime

01:51:07.962 --> 01:51:10.047
Get together

01:51:10.131 --> 01:51:11.883
One more time

01:51:13.718 --> 01:51:15.761
Get together

01:51:15.845 --> 01:51:17.597
One more time

01:52:14.904 --> 01:52:18.616
You're all a bunch
of fucking slaves!

01:52:21.786 --> 01:52:24.705
How long you think
it's going to last?

01:52:24.789 --> 01:52:27.917
How long are you gonna let 'em
push you around?

01:52:28.042 --> 01:52:30.002
I'll tell you this.

01:52:30.044 --> 01:52:34.048
I'm gonna get my kicks before
the whole shithouse goes up in flames.

01:52:34.173 --> 01:52:36.092
All right.

01:52:38.803 --> 01:52:41.389
"Light My Fire!" Come on, Jim!

01:52:43.891 --> 01:52:45.059
Fuck you, man!

01:52:45.142 --> 01:52:48.563
That's the word.
That's the very little word.

01:52:48.646 --> 01:52:53.317
Come on, let me hear it.
All your little hatred.

01:52:53.442 --> 01:52:56.404
You'd all eat shit, wouldn't ya?

01:52:59.991 --> 01:53:04.412
Adolf Hitler is alive and well
and living in Miami.

01:53:05.746 --> 01:53:08.249
I fucked her last night.

01:53:10.751 --> 01:53:12.336
What are you gonna do about it?

01:53:28.477 --> 01:53:32.648
Come on, come on, come on
Come on and suck me, babe

01:53:32.732 --> 01:53:37.695
Can't you see
that I need some head

01:53:37.737 --> 01:53:41.532
What was that--
Wait a minute. Ah, bullshit!

01:53:41.616 --> 01:53:45.328
It's fucked up, man.
It's all bullshit!

01:53:45.369 --> 01:53:48.122
It's all fucked up.
I'm coming out!

01:53:49.373 --> 01:53:51.500
Miami Beach, Florida, huh?

01:53:54.712 --> 01:53:58.132
Hey, I went to Florida State.

01:53:58.216 --> 01:54:01.886
Then I got smart
and moved to California.

01:54:01.928 --> 01:54:06.724
They're trying to change the world
out there in California.

01:54:06.766 --> 01:54:09.977
No, I ain't talkin' about
no revolution.

01:54:10.061 --> 01:54:13.981
I'm talkin' about having
a good time this summer.

01:54:15.233 --> 01:54:19.153
I'm talking about love your neighbor
until it hurts.

01:54:20.446 --> 01:54:23.241
Come on.
How 'bout a little nakedness?

01:54:25.534 --> 01:54:28.663
Come on. Let's see
some action out there.

01:54:28.746 --> 01:54:32.792
I'm talkin' about love, love, love.

01:54:34.502 --> 01:54:38.965
I'm talkin' about
you and me lovin'--

01:54:50.518 --> 01:54:53.479
Anybody gonna come up here
and love my ass?

01:54:53.521 --> 01:54:56.274
Come on. I'm lonely up here.

01:54:56.315 --> 01:54:58.150
I love you!

01:54:58.234 --> 01:55:00.194
Come on, sweetheart.
You want to see it?

01:55:00.278 --> 01:55:04.282
Why don't I pull it out for you,
shake it around a little bit?

01:55:05.449 --> 01:55:07.702
Will that do it for ya?

01:55:09.328 --> 01:55:12.039
All right, now.
I'm gonna show it to you.

01:55:19.380 --> 01:55:20.923
You see it?

01:55:23.467 --> 01:55:26.387
Yeah, I saw it!

01:55:26.429 --> 01:55:28.514
I wanna see some action out there!

01:55:34.562 --> 01:55:36.772
No limits! No laws!

01:55:36.856 --> 01:55:39.275
You want to fuck?
Come on up here!

01:55:39.358 --> 01:55:42.695
- This is your show! Yeah!
- Get off my stage, motherfucker!

01:55:42.737 --> 01:55:45.489
No laws! No limits!

01:55:46.908 --> 01:55:49.785
Yeah! Fuckin' rock god!

01:55:59.170 --> 01:56:02.256
Where's the guy with the penis?
Where's that son of a bitch? Get back!

01:56:04.884 --> 01:56:07.220
Fat cat in a top hat

01:56:14.936 --> 01:56:16.896
Dead cat in a top hat

01:56:20.816 --> 01:56:23.903
Suckin' on a young man's

01:56:23.986 --> 01:56:25.404
Love

01:56:27.865 --> 01:56:30.660
Wishin' he could come, yeah

01:56:33.120 --> 01:56:35.873
Suckin' on a soldier's brain

01:56:38.292 --> 01:56:41.170
Wishin' it would be the same

01:56:47.552 --> 01:56:50.972
Dead rats
See, you're an aristocrat

01:56:53.266 --> 01:56:55.726
Well, that's crap

01:56:55.851 --> 01:56:58.813
You know, the day
destroy the night

01:56:58.896 --> 01:57:01.482
Night divide the day

01:57:01.566 --> 01:57:04.318
Try to run, try to hide

01:57:04.402 --> 01:57:06.779
Break on through
to the other side

01:57:14.912 --> 01:57:16.831
Come on!

01:57:17.999 --> 01:57:20.418
Chased our pleasures here

01:57:20.459 --> 01:57:22.628
Dug our treasures there

01:57:22.753 --> 01:57:26.173
Can you still recall
the time we cried

01:57:26.257 --> 01:57:28.259
Break on through to--

01:57:47.820 --> 01:57:50.656
Mr. Morrison.

01:57:50.740 --> 01:57:54.035
You are charged with lewd behavior
on four counts.

01:57:54.118 --> 01:57:58.205
Simulated masturbation...

01:57:58.289 --> 01:58:00.207
public drunkenness...

01:58:01.334 --> 01:58:02.752
profanity...

01:58:03.878 --> 01:58:05.796
and public exposure.

01:58:07.006 --> 01:58:08.758
How do you plead?

01:58:08.841 --> 01:58:10.760
The defendant pleads not guilty,
Your Honor.

01:58:10.843 --> 01:58:12.470
Then trial is set for the week--

01:58:12.553 --> 01:58:16.557
I want to bring to the jury's attention
that there's playing now on Broadway...

01:58:16.599 --> 01:58:19.185
a musical called "Hair"
where the actors disrobe...

01:58:19.227 --> 01:58:21.354
and appear naked on the stage.

01:58:21.395 --> 01:58:24.690
- Objection. That's irrelevant.
- Sustained.

01:58:24.732 --> 01:58:26.734
Your Honor,
how can you sustain that?

01:58:26.817 --> 01:58:28.736
Stick to the facts.

01:58:28.819 --> 01:58:31.072
This is a major
First Amendment violation...

01:58:31.155 --> 01:58:33.741
by the politicians
and the police of Miami.

01:58:33.783 --> 01:58:36.077
Every single witness
they've brought here...

01:58:36.160 --> 01:58:39.789
has testified to not actually seeing
my client's genitals...

01:58:39.872 --> 01:58:43.376
except one, who is related
to the arresting officer.

01:58:43.417 --> 01:58:46.754
I tell you, if you convict
on such lack of evidence...

01:58:46.837 --> 01:58:51.092
I assure you that someday, somewhere
in the still of the night...

01:58:51.133 --> 01:58:53.803
you will wake up screaming.

01:58:59.350 --> 01:59:01.811
Are you gonna get rid of it?

01:59:06.607 --> 01:59:08.818
Look.

01:59:08.859 --> 01:59:13.739
Wouldn't it be better to have a kid with
someone who wanted to be its father?

01:59:13.823 --> 01:59:16.784
It'd be a fucking genius.
That's what it'd be.

01:59:18.703 --> 01:59:20.997
You and me?

01:59:21.038 --> 01:59:23.624
The child would be a goddess...

01:59:23.666 --> 01:59:26.210
or a god.

01:59:26.294 --> 01:59:28.212
It'd be a monster.

01:59:31.382 --> 01:59:33.718
No. Look.

01:59:33.759 --> 01:59:36.512
I got this trial
that's hanging on me.

01:59:36.554 --> 01:59:40.683
I can't afford this.
I don't want the responsibility.

01:59:40.725 --> 01:59:44.478
You're a coward,
just a little boy!

01:59:44.562 --> 01:59:47.398
The only way you can't afford it
is emotionally!

01:59:47.440 --> 01:59:51.110
Those vows were forever
in the goddess' sight!

01:59:51.193 --> 01:59:54.488
"Death does not part,
only lack of love."

01:59:54.572 --> 01:59:56.657
Come on, Patricia.

01:59:56.741 --> 01:59:58.868
I was stoned.

02:00:00.536 --> 02:00:03.372
It seemed like a fun thing
to do at the time.

02:00:06.584 --> 02:00:10.254
Fuck you.
I'm gonna have the kid.

02:00:10.338 --> 02:00:13.382
Well, then it will be your kid.

02:00:13.424 --> 02:00:16.469
But if you want the abortion,
I'll be there with you.

02:00:16.552 --> 02:00:18.387
- Oh, no, you won't.
- Yes, I will.

02:00:18.471 --> 02:00:21.390
Bullshit, Morrison!
You know who you are!

02:00:24.101 --> 02:00:27.104
What difference
does it make, you know?

02:00:27.146 --> 02:00:29.232
You never pretended.

02:00:30.399 --> 02:00:32.401
I did.

02:00:32.485 --> 02:00:35.404
Yeah, I don't even like kids,
particularly.

02:00:36.614 --> 02:00:39.659
I don't want the other
fuckin' thing either.

02:00:44.038 --> 02:00:45.248
Well.

02:00:47.583 --> 02:00:51.003
Have you looked in the mirror lately?

02:00:51.045 --> 02:00:54.340
- Look at that stomach.
- Come on, now.

02:00:54.423 --> 02:00:56.634
Don't say these things.

02:01:15.570 --> 02:01:19.240
James Douglas Morrison...

02:01:19.323 --> 02:01:21.576
I hereby sentence you...

02:01:21.659 --> 02:01:24.787
to six months of hard labor
in the Dade County jail.

02:01:24.912 --> 02:01:26.581
And for public exposure...

02:01:26.706 --> 02:01:30.126
I'm sentencing you
to 60 days of the same...

02:01:30.209 --> 02:01:33.671
after which you are to serve
two years and four months...

02:01:33.754 --> 02:01:35.840
of probationary time.

02:01:35.923 --> 02:01:39.260
Your Honor, I have an appellate bond
in the sum of $50,000 here.

02:01:39.302 --> 02:01:42.305
I ask that Mr. Morrison remain free,
pending his appeal.

02:01:49.562 --> 02:01:53.482
Everywhere, Jim-- Jacksonville, Dallas,
even Kent State University canceled.

02:01:53.608 --> 02:01:56.110
The press for the first time
turned against us. We're fucked.

02:01:56.193 --> 02:02:00.323
Pamela's called six times.
Katherine, Patricia. Gayle's pregnant.

02:02:00.406 --> 02:02:02.491
You gotta go to the dentist.
Look, Jim.

02:02:02.575 --> 02:02:04.368
Go home, get some sleep.

02:02:04.493 --> 02:02:07.705
- Wash your hair.
- Take a bath too, man.

02:02:07.830 --> 02:02:11.000
- Jesus, this guy really despises you.
- We weren't even invited to Woodstock.

02:02:11.083 --> 02:02:12.668
Twenty other bands. Not us.

02:02:12.752 --> 02:02:14.503
First Hendrix, now Janis.

02:02:14.629 --> 02:02:17.173
Radio stations won't play us.
Some big cities.

02:02:17.298 --> 02:02:19.675
Philly, Cinci, Chicago, Detroit.

02:02:19.717 --> 02:02:21.761
We can drag this appeal out for years,
keep you out of jail.

02:02:21.844 --> 02:02:24.847
The F.B.l.'s behind it.
They had memos on you in Phoenix.

02:02:24.889 --> 02:02:26.849
They extradited you to Miami.

02:02:26.933 --> 02:02:28.100
A new image.

02:02:28.184 --> 02:02:31.354
Slow, quiet. The beard.
The elder of the tribe.

02:02:35.066 --> 02:02:39.028
Mine eyes have seen the glory
of the coming of the Lord!

02:02:40.279 --> 02:02:41.572
The band you love to hate.

02:02:41.614 --> 02:02:43.074
Let's win there.

02:02:44.075 --> 02:02:45.117
It was fun.

02:02:53.334 --> 02:02:56.420
I think I'm having
a nervous breakdown.

02:03:00.049 --> 02:03:03.010
- Do you hear me?
- Climb on the edge, baby.

02:03:03.094 --> 02:03:05.096
We're rolling, Jim.

02:03:05.137 --> 02:03:07.223
- Jump!
- Let him dance a little bit.

02:03:07.265 --> 02:03:10.935
I want you to come back in here
this minute, Jim Morrison.

02:03:10.977 --> 02:03:13.229
I am not gonna kill myself for you.

02:03:13.312 --> 02:03:16.649
- Goddamn it, Jim!
- Your whole life is bullshit!

02:03:16.691 --> 02:03:19.485
- Shut up!
- You want me, come out and get me!

02:03:19.569 --> 02:03:21.112
Oh, no!

02:03:21.153 --> 02:03:23.823
Jim, where are you--
Pam, get back inside!

02:03:23.906 --> 02:03:27.451
- I love you.
- Come out here, honey.

02:03:28.661 --> 02:03:31.330
- Come on, baby.
- Jim, give her your hand.

02:03:31.372 --> 02:03:34.500
- She's gonna fall.
- Once more with feeling.

02:03:34.584 --> 02:03:35.918
Take two.

02:03:36.002 --> 02:03:39.338
- I don't want to die.
- Man, we gotta finish it.

02:03:39.380 --> 02:03:42.842
- We don't have an ending, Ray.
- All the poetry has wolves in it.

02:03:42.884 --> 02:03:45.511
- The most beautiful--
- Come on, girl.

02:03:45.553 --> 02:03:48.973
I see your hair is burning

02:03:49.015 --> 02:03:51.684
The most beautiful one of all...

02:03:51.767 --> 02:03:54.854
dances in a ring of fire...

02:03:54.937 --> 02:03:58.524
then throws off a challenge
with a shrug.

02:03:58.566 --> 02:04:00.401
That's my girl.

02:04:02.153 --> 02:04:05.197
Let's go. Let's leave this place.

02:04:05.239 --> 02:04:07.283
Just you and me, baby.

02:04:07.366 --> 02:04:09.577
We can, you know.

02:04:10.786 --> 02:04:12.204
Just one more step.

02:04:15.833 --> 02:04:17.210
I want to live!

02:04:17.251 --> 02:04:19.712
I want to live with you!

02:04:22.632 --> 02:04:25.843
All the poetry
has wolves in it, Pam.

02:04:26.719 --> 02:04:28.638
All but one.

02:04:30.306 --> 02:04:33.226
The most beautiful one of all.

02:04:34.310 --> 02:04:37.396
I hope you go out smiling...

02:04:37.438 --> 02:04:41.317
like a child
into the cool remnant of a dream.

02:04:43.986 --> 02:04:46.822
The angel man...

02:04:46.906 --> 02:04:50.660
has finally claimed
this benevolent soul.

02:04:51.744 --> 02:04:54.038
Ophelia...

02:04:54.121 --> 02:04:57.667
leaves sudden in silk.

02:04:57.708 --> 02:04:59.710
Glory in dream.

02:05:01.003 --> 02:05:03.506
Mad, stifled witness.

02:05:24.193 --> 02:05:25.903
All right!

02:05:27.238 --> 02:05:29.407
Hi, Dorothy.
Oh, you cut your hair.

02:05:29.490 --> 02:05:32.910
- We're trying to have another baby.
- Was your hair getting in the way?

02:05:34.287 --> 02:05:36.497
Where's Ray?
I got to catch a plane.

02:05:36.581 --> 02:05:38.416
He's upstairs.

02:05:38.499 --> 02:05:41.294
- Where's Princess?
- Out back.

02:05:45.590 --> 02:05:48.426
We added a rain effect
to "Riders," man.

02:05:48.467 --> 02:05:50.428
It's great.

02:05:52.138 --> 02:05:55.099
It's the best album
since "Days," man.

02:05:56.434 --> 02:05:58.936
I must admit it's pretty good...

02:05:59.061 --> 02:06:02.273
for four guys who weren't even
talking to each other that day.

02:06:03.608 --> 02:06:06.444
So you're really gonna live
in Paris, huh, man?

02:06:06.527 --> 02:06:09.488
Yeah. You know, be anonymous,
write a book.

02:06:11.574 --> 02:06:15.328
"Observations of an American
While On Trial in Miami."

02:06:15.411 --> 02:06:17.371
Still got a lot
of good songs in you.

02:06:17.455 --> 02:06:19.999
Still think we got a couple
of blues albums in us.

02:06:20.124 --> 02:06:21.500
I'm pinned, man.

02:06:21.584 --> 02:06:24.670
They got a category
for everything we do.

02:06:26.047 --> 02:06:28.007
I'm a wanted man.

02:06:31.510 --> 02:06:34.055
I'm gonna miss you, man.

02:06:34.180 --> 02:06:38.100
I'm gonna miss that feeling
of playing music with you, man.

02:06:38.184 --> 02:06:40.519
You, John, miss me?

02:06:40.603 --> 02:06:43.314
More than you think, asshole.

02:06:43.397 --> 02:06:45.191
Yeah.

02:06:45.316 --> 02:06:47.944
You can always whip
the horses' eyes.

02:06:51.280 --> 02:06:53.783
As far as I'm concerned...

02:06:53.866 --> 02:06:56.452
I made music with Dionysus.

02:06:57.912 --> 02:07:01.290
We had moments onstage
that no one will ever fucking know.

02:07:03.084 --> 02:07:05.461
You lay off those drugs, Robby.

02:07:06.921 --> 02:07:08.881
Hey, Merry Christmas.

02:07:17.265 --> 02:07:19.934
We'll get together again,
you know...

02:07:20.017 --> 02:07:22.186
in some strange way.

02:07:22.270 --> 02:07:25.481
Maybe we'll make a movie together.
Black and white.

02:07:34.657 --> 02:07:37.493
Sabrina, this is for you.

02:07:41.998 --> 02:07:45.668
- Morrison, see you around.
- What, no bon voyage?

02:07:45.751 --> 02:07:47.837
I'll see you back.

02:07:49.422 --> 02:07:52.133
And little Princess Smiling Face...

02:07:52.174 --> 02:07:55.386
this one's for you...

02:07:55.469 --> 02:07:57.847
from Chief Mojo Rising.

02:08:00.516 --> 02:08:01.851
Happy birthday, Princess.

02:08:01.934 --> 02:08:05.354
- Let me see.
- It's you.

02:08:05.438 --> 02:08:07.398
Forever young.

02:08:08.983 --> 02:08:12.695
The strangest life
I've ever known.

02:08:58.741 --> 02:09:01.160
Jim. You got a plane to catch, man?

02:09:05.748 --> 02:09:08.125
Yeah.

02:09:08.167 --> 02:09:11.003
We're reaching for death
on the end of a candle.

02:09:11.087 --> 02:09:14.382
We're trying for something
that's already found us.

02:09:14.465 --> 02:09:16.384
Last words.

02:09:16.467 --> 02:09:18.844
Out.

02:09:26.185 --> 02:09:27.812
Did you get all that?

02:09:29.355 --> 02:09:30.481
Yeah.

02:09:30.523 --> 02:09:32.483
I got it, Jim.

02:09:42.034 --> 02:09:44.829
Come on. Let's get some tacos.

02:10:03.222 --> 02:10:04.640
Death.

02:10:06.684 --> 02:10:08.853
It's not so bad.

02:10:08.936 --> 02:10:11.105
- Jim?
- I love my girl.

02:10:11.188 --> 02:10:13.524
Jim, is that you?

02:10:55.191 --> 02:10:59.570
I knew it was you, Jim Morrison.
I always know when it's you.

02:11:10.957 --> 02:11:13.251
Come on, baby.
Get out of the tub.

02:11:13.376 --> 02:11:16.003
Come on. Mama will dry you off.

02:11:16.087 --> 02:11:19.549
Just stop joking around, you hear me?
Just cut it out.

02:11:50.746 --> 02:11:53.124
Was it all right, Jim?

02:11:55.877 --> 02:11:58.629
Did you enjoy it when it came...

02:12:00.631 --> 02:12:03.134
just like you said you would?

02:12:30.870 --> 02:12:33.205
They are waiting to take us...

02:12:33.289 --> 02:12:35.541
into the severed garden.

02:12:35.625 --> 02:12:38.628
You know how pale and wanton
thrillful comes death...

02:12:38.711 --> 02:12:40.713
in the strange hour...

02:12:40.796 --> 02:12:43.591
unannounced, unplanned for...

02:12:43.674 --> 02:12:48.262
like a scary, over-friendly guest
you've brought to bed.

02:12:48.346 --> 02:12:51.599
Death makes angels of us all
and give us wings...

02:12:51.682 --> 02:12:55.353
where we had shoulders
smooth as ravens' claws.

02:13:00.233 --> 02:13:02.610
No more money, no more fancy dress.

02:13:02.693 --> 02:13:05.488
This other kingdom seems
by far the best...

02:13:05.571 --> 02:13:08.741
until its other jaw
reveals incest...

02:13:08.783 --> 02:13:11.911
and loose obedience
to a vegetable law.

02:13:11.953 --> 02:13:15.456
I will not go.

02:13:15.498 --> 02:13:18.876
I prefer a feast of friends
to the giant family.
