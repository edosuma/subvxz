00:04.405 --> 00:06.074
* Sometimes parents
get stuck at work *

00:06.140 --> 00:07.708
* They want to pick you up,
but their boss is a jerk *

00:07.775 --> 00:10.844
* And that's when a kid
and day care worker must wait *

00:10.911 --> 00:13.181
* Because parents are late *

00:13.247 --> 00:14.948
* By now I usually hear
your father's van *

00:15.015 --> 00:16.917
* But it's not like
I have any big plans *

00:16.984 --> 00:19.053
* It's been forever
since I was out with a man *

00:19.120 --> 00:20.454
Well...

00:20.521 --> 00:22.423
I mean, like out out, like...

00:22.490 --> 00:24.092
you know, somewhere nice.

00:24.158 --> 00:25.893
I've had booty calls, so...

00:25.959 --> 00:27.161
and I'm doing okay,

00:27.228 --> 00:28.896
but... I'm just ready

00:28.962 --> 00:31.565
for something more, you know?

00:31.632 --> 00:33.801
And I don't know how long
I'm gonna have to wait...

00:33.867 --> 00:35.836
* And wait and wait
and wait and wait *

00:35.903 --> 00:37.805
* When parents are late. *

00:37.871 --> 00:42.210
Well, that's all the words
that I have for that song.

00:45.846 --> 00:49.049
(playing melody)

00:53.654 --> 00:55.589
(engine rattling)

00:55.656 --> 00:56.624
JIMMY: Sorry!

00:56.690 --> 00:58.359
I knew I was late,
but I didn't realize

00:58.426 --> 01:00.428
I was trombone-solo late.

01:01.595 --> 01:02.830
* *

01:02.896 --> 01:04.798
* Whoo *

01:04.865 --> 01:05.999
* Here we go *

01:06.066 --> 01:07.568
* Oh, oh, oh *

01:07.635 --> 01:09.069
* Oh, oh, oh *

01:09.137 --> 01:10.471
(typing)

01:10.538 --> 01:12.140
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's that?

01:12.206 --> 01:13.507
Oh, it's our new computer.

01:13.574 --> 01:16.877
The lady I clean for caught
her son shaving his privates

01:16.944 --> 01:18.646
on something called
"Chat Roulette."

01:18.712 --> 01:20.914
Anyway, he got shipped off
to military school

01:20.981 --> 01:22.750
and we got a new computer!

01:22.816 --> 01:24.652
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
slow down there, Jimmy.

01:24.718 --> 01:26.620
Do you even know what
the hell you're doing?

01:26.687 --> 01:28.456
Of course he knows
what he's doing, Burt!

01:28.522 --> 01:30.224
It's a computer,
not a condom.

01:30.291 --> 01:31.459
(chuckles)
Hilarious, Mom.

01:31.525 --> 01:33.461
And relax, Dad--
nothing's gonna happen.

01:33.527 --> 01:35.929
I'm telling you, that machine
brings all the bad stuff

01:35.996 --> 01:37.064
right into your house!

01:37.131 --> 01:38.232
If you're a
repulsive shopper,

01:38.299 --> 01:39.667
you buy stuff on
there; if you're

01:39.733 --> 01:41.602
a sex addict, there's
plenty of that on there.

01:41.669 --> 01:44.738
Yeah, we get it-- there's
eBay and porn and gambling.

01:44.805 --> 01:46.640
There's gambling
on there? If I...

01:46.707 --> 01:48.976
Oh, see? I can't even
be in the same room

01:49.042 --> 01:50.478
as that thing!
Hey...

01:50.544 --> 01:52.280
ask it if they
ever found that city

01:52.346 --> 01:54.148
David Copperfield
made disappear.

01:54.215 --> 01:55.516
What kind of gambling?
'Cause I think

01:55.583 --> 01:57.351
a little bit wouldn't
be a problem for me.

02:02.623 --> 02:05.058
Can you imagine what
it's like to be an ant?

02:05.125 --> 02:06.994
It's like you and
ten of your buddies

02:07.060 --> 02:08.962
pick up a potato chip,
bring it back

02:09.029 --> 02:11.232
to your ant family
so everyone can eat,

02:11.299 --> 02:13.234
and it takes you,
like, three hours

02:13.301 --> 02:17.271
to get from over there
to over there.

02:17.338 --> 02:19.940
And just when you think
you got it all figured out,

02:20.007 --> 02:22.743
some jerk comes
along and...

02:22.810 --> 02:24.845
(chuckles)

02:24.912 --> 02:26.714
Ants.

02:26.780 --> 02:29.049
Uh, here's your half
of the cookie.

02:29.116 --> 02:30.951
Oh, cool.

02:31.018 --> 02:32.353
(sighs)

02:32.420 --> 02:35.223
Thanks for the show, boys.

02:36.424 --> 02:39.159
(musical horn honks a tune)

02:39.227 --> 02:41.094
Oh, God.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.930
Look who it is.

02:51.205 --> 02:52.673
Burt!

02:52.740 --> 02:54.074
Jimmy!

02:54.141 --> 02:55.743
Thumb.
Thumb.

02:55.809 --> 02:58.111
I thought you were
putting me out of business.

02:58.178 --> 03:00.013
How long ago was that, Burt?

03:00.080 --> 03:02.115
20 years.
Your daddy ever

03:02.182 --> 03:03.751
tell you what he said to me

03:03.817 --> 03:05.353
the day he quit?

03:05.419 --> 03:08.021
"Take this job and shave it."
(laughing)

03:08.088 --> 03:11.392
"Shove it." I said,
"Take this job and shove it."

03:11.459 --> 03:13.093
He said "shave it."

03:13.160 --> 03:14.895
I meant "shove it."

03:14.962 --> 03:16.830
You know,

03:16.897 --> 03:19.900
the city parks contract
is up for grabs again.

03:19.967 --> 03:20.968
I noticed you
don't even

03:21.034 --> 03:22.736
put in a bid anymore.

03:22.803 --> 03:25.005
I don't need
any city contracts.

03:25.072 --> 03:26.907
I don't need the hassle.

03:26.974 --> 03:30.378
My son and I, we got
a good thing going
with our two-man crew.

03:32.380 --> 03:36.450
(blowing whistle)

03:37.551 --> 03:40.254
Yeah, having a big crew sucks.

03:40.321 --> 03:41.689
Gotta go!

03:42.956 --> 03:43.857
(phone ringing)

03:46.594 --> 03:49.062
Oh, it's Hope's
day care.

03:49.129 --> 03:50.431
Hello?
SHELLY (over phone):
Hey, Jimmy...

03:50.498 --> 03:51.965
(quietly):
Big crew...

03:52.032 --> 03:53.000
What?

03:53.066 --> 03:54.568
You're kidding.

03:57.037 --> 04:00.107
Um, uh, there's some
sort of green fluid

04:00.173 --> 04:01.442
coming out of her nose.

04:01.509 --> 04:03.344
It could be mucus,
but we don't know.

04:03.411 --> 04:04.612
It's just a cold.

04:04.678 --> 04:07.014
Uh, yes, she'd
be a new patient.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.450
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I don't know, hold on a second.

04:09.517 --> 04:11.452
Um, what type of
insurance do we have?

04:12.486 --> 04:13.954
(both laughing)

04:14.021 --> 04:15.456
(laughing)

04:16.790 --> 04:18.158
We don't have that.
No.

04:18.225 --> 04:19.560
Uh, yes, hello?

04:19.627 --> 04:21.662
(nervous laugh)
Uh... I don't have insurance,

04:21.729 --> 04:23.230
so is that, is that
gonna be a problem?

04:23.297 --> 04:24.532
(phone line clicks)

04:24.598 --> 04:25.833
Hello?

04:25.899 --> 04:27.368
Um, hello?

04:27.435 --> 04:29.102
(laughing)
Insurance!

04:29.169 --> 04:31.472
Sure, I'll just have
the butler go get it

04:31.539 --> 04:33.173
out of the hot air balloon.

04:33.240 --> 04:35.743
(both laughing)

04:35.809 --> 04:37.010
(laughing)

04:43.617 --> 04:44.852
I can't believe it.

04:44.918 --> 04:46.420
I've called every
doctor in town,

04:46.487 --> 04:47.688
and no one'll see me
without insurance--

04:47.755 --> 04:49.890
which they tell me most
people get from their boss.

04:51.124 --> 04:52.092
What are you guys doing?

04:52.159 --> 04:53.727
Quarantining Maw Maw.

04:53.794 --> 04:56.196
She's 84 years old,
and if she catches Hope's cold,

04:56.263 --> 04:57.531
it could kill her.

04:57.598 --> 04:59.967
And that means dealing with
that creepy funeral director.

05:00.033 --> 05:01.301
(shudders)
No thank you.

05:01.369 --> 05:03.737
(drill whirring)

05:07.107 --> 05:10.978
How are we supposed to pass
the food through that?

05:11.044 --> 05:13.080
I figured...

05:13.146 --> 05:14.047
pour it through this.

05:14.114 --> 05:15.383
(gasps)

05:15.449 --> 05:17.618
Well, when you get
done with that,
maybe you can tell me

05:17.685 --> 05:19.887
why you don't have insurance
for your only employee.

05:19.953 --> 05:21.288
I can't afford it.

05:21.355 --> 05:22.423
Besides, it's unnecessary.

05:22.490 --> 05:23.724
We're not cars, Jimmy.

05:23.791 --> 05:25.459
The human body
heals itself.

05:25.526 --> 05:28.729
Look, Jimmy, it's natural
to get worried

05:28.796 --> 05:30.931
when your baby's sick,
but it's normal.

05:30.998 --> 05:33.967
You get sick, you get better,
you get sick, you get better,

05:34.034 --> 05:36.103
you get sick, you die--
that's life.

05:36.169 --> 05:37.505
We can't do nothing.

05:37.571 --> 05:39.807
What did you guys do
when I got sick?

05:41.208 --> 05:42.510
(sighs)

05:42.576 --> 05:43.944
You did nothing?

05:44.011 --> 05:47.014
No! Obviously,
when you were really bad,

05:47.080 --> 05:48.882
we called the doctor.

05:48.949 --> 05:50.884
MAN (on radio):
Now, the shampoo will kill them,

05:50.951 --> 05:52.786
but it may take
a couple of tries.

05:52.853 --> 05:55.288
Come on, give
me the phone.
Shh. I'm on next.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.425
I think I'm going to barf.

05:57.491 --> 06:00.661
Next up, we have a call from
a young mother named Virginia.

06:00.728 --> 06:03.130
Virginia, welcome
to The Dr. Tim Show.

06:03.196 --> 06:04.532
I'm... Dr. Tim.

06:04.598 --> 06:07.701
Hi, Dr. Tim!
Okay, so my baby has...

06:07.768 --> 06:09.437
Baba-booey!
Baba-booey!

06:09.503 --> 06:11.472
(click, dial tone drones)

06:11.539 --> 06:12.440
I could've died.

06:12.506 --> 06:14.842
Stop being so dramatic.

06:14.908 --> 06:18.311
You're lucky we
didn't pump you
full of antibiotics.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.147
Hey, you're like
that expensive meat

06:20.213 --> 06:23.383
they sell at those fancy stores
where everybody has B.O.

06:23.451 --> 06:25.719
and they make you
bring your own bags.

06:25.786 --> 06:27.488
No. You just did
the least amount

06:27.555 --> 06:28.922
of work possible
and got lucky.

06:28.989 --> 06:31.391
But I'm not just gonna wait
around and see what happens.

06:31.459 --> 06:32.760
I'm taking Hope
to that free clinic

06:32.826 --> 06:34.361
I found in the computer.
Fine,

06:34.428 --> 06:36.664
but I'm going with you
so I can laugh in your face

06:36.730 --> 06:38.365
when the doctor tells you
I was right.

06:38.432 --> 06:40.200
Good. That way
when the doctor says

06:40.267 --> 06:43.737
Hope has some horrible disease,
I can laugh in your face.

06:45.238 --> 06:47.808
But I won't,
because I'll be very sad.

06:47.875 --> 06:49.142
(coughs)

06:51.845 --> 06:53.046
(coughs)

06:55.949 --> 06:56.884
(coughs)

07:03.857 --> 07:05.759
Okay.

07:05.826 --> 07:09.362
A doctor can see Hope
next Tuesday at 11:00 a.m.

07:09.429 --> 07:12.232
But... but that's
practically a week from now.

07:12.299 --> 07:13.634
Look, we are

07:13.701 --> 07:16.336
a free clinic, and we
are doing the best we can.

07:16.403 --> 07:17.771
Shoot, we only got
one thermometer.

07:17.838 --> 07:20.140
But she could be better
by next Tuesday.

07:20.207 --> 07:22.843
Probably. From the looks
of these symptoms,

07:22.910 --> 07:24.812
I'm guessing it's
just a cold.

07:24.878 --> 07:26.714
Thank you!

07:30.017 --> 07:31.184
Hey, um,

07:31.251 --> 07:32.686
I want to buy
cough medicine,

07:32.753 --> 07:34.622
but all that's there
are these cards.

07:34.688 --> 07:36.456
Uh, do I give this to you?

07:36.524 --> 07:37.825
Sure do.

07:37.891 --> 07:38.926
(beep)

07:38.992 --> 07:41.228
(alarm beeping)

07:41.294 --> 07:43.463
What's happening?
Did I win something?

07:43.531 --> 07:46.299
Yep. A starring role
in my favorite show.

07:46.366 --> 07:47.901
Apparently, cough syrup
is the main ingredient

07:47.968 --> 07:50.971
used by meth labs, so we
can't just sell it to anybody.

07:51.038 --> 07:53.674
Frederick, Frederick,
guard the door.

07:56.143 --> 07:58.078
Dilated pupils.

07:58.145 --> 07:59.847
What's your name, tweaker?
You have some I.D.?

07:59.913 --> 08:00.814
Tell him I'm not a meth-head.

08:00.881 --> 08:02.082
I've never met this guy.

08:02.149 --> 08:03.350
Come on.

08:03.416 --> 08:04.818
Shifty eyes.

08:04.885 --> 08:05.719
Check.

08:05.786 --> 08:06.954
Pasty skin. Check.

08:07.020 --> 08:07.988
Poor hygiene.

08:08.055 --> 08:09.022
Check. Bad teeth.

08:09.089 --> 08:11.258
Check.
I know I should brush better,

08:11.324 --> 08:12.459
but I'm not a tweaker.

08:12.526 --> 08:14.261
We will see
what the database says.

08:16.897 --> 08:18.899
Great. Now I can't get medicine
for my daughter.

08:18.966 --> 08:21.168
Oh, come on.
You can't give
that to Hope.

08:21.234 --> 08:23.103
Look, it says right here:
"Not for children

08:23.170 --> 08:25.172
under the age of two.
Please consult a doctor."

08:25.238 --> 08:27.174
I've tried to consult a doctor,
but I couldn't,

08:27.240 --> 08:28.475
because I
don't have insurance.

08:28.542 --> 08:29.910
You should work here.

08:29.977 --> 08:32.045
Everybody gets insurance,
even the part-timers.

08:32.112 --> 08:33.881
Wow. Nice owners.

08:33.947 --> 08:35.783
Well, you're not
on our list,

08:35.849 --> 08:37.885
so I can't legally prevent
you from buying this.

08:37.951 --> 08:39.486
But I want you to look
into your heart...

08:39.553 --> 08:40.721
I don't want it anymore.

08:41.689 --> 08:42.923
I knew it!

08:42.990 --> 08:44.257
That's five this
week, people!

08:44.324 --> 08:46.526
I've turned five this week!

08:46.594 --> 08:50.530
Barney Hughes--
selling groceries, saving lives.

08:52.465 --> 08:53.701
(loud knocking)

08:53.767 --> 08:56.570
No, I cannot
pour faster, Maw Maw--

08:56.637 --> 08:58.271
you'll get a brain freeze.

08:58.338 --> 09:01.141
She loves her smoothies,
but she just can't pace herself.

09:01.208 --> 09:02.976
I think I've figured out
how to get insurance for Hope.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.945
Why? Her cold's
practically gone.

09:05.012 --> 09:06.246
Well, yeah,
but that doesn't mean

09:06.313 --> 09:07.581
she's never
gonna get another one.

09:07.648 --> 09:08.749
Or something worse.

09:08.816 --> 09:10.217
She needs insurance.

09:10.283 --> 09:11.685
(loud knocking)

09:11.752 --> 09:15.388
No! I'm counting to ten before
I pour more-- deal with it!

09:15.455 --> 09:17.625
What's your plan?

09:17.691 --> 09:20.127
They need a bagger
at the grocery store.

09:20.193 --> 09:23.063
You can't do that, Jimmy--
you work for me.

09:23.130 --> 09:24.632
Well, I'm still gonna work
for you in the daytime.

09:24.698 --> 09:25.733
This is at night...

09:25.799 --> 09:27.300
and what are you doing
with my daughter?

09:27.367 --> 09:29.703
I'm getting her up
where the good steam is.

09:29.770 --> 09:31.071
VIRGINIA:
Some of us know how

09:31.138 --> 09:33.440
to treat a cold,
which is all that is.

09:33.506 --> 09:35.609
(loud knocking)
It's coming!

09:35.676 --> 09:37.110
You can't work
at that store, Jimmy.

09:37.177 --> 09:38.746
You'll be low man
on the totem pole,

09:38.812 --> 09:40.814
just like I was when
I worked for Green Thumb.

09:40.881 --> 09:42.950
You ever seen a totem pole?
You got, like, six people

09:43.016 --> 09:44.417
and an eagle
standing on your head.

09:44.484 --> 09:45.719
That's no way to live, man.

09:45.786 --> 09:47.554
Listen, if you really
think you need insurance,

09:47.621 --> 09:49.189
I'll figure something out.

09:49.256 --> 09:51.324
How? I thought you
said you can't afford it.

09:51.391 --> 09:52.425
Don't worry.

09:52.492 --> 09:53.694
Here, take her.

09:54.828 --> 09:55.996
Your dad knows
how to take care

09:56.063 --> 09:57.364
of things when
he needs to.

09:57.430 --> 10:00.133
I'm gonna steal that contract
away from Green Thumb.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.635
They're not gonna
give you this job.

10:01.702 --> 10:05.238
Green Thumb's crew shows up
in clean, matching jumpsuits.

10:05.305 --> 10:06.974
Half the people in this town
have seen you

10:07.040 --> 10:08.108
mow lawns in
your pajama bottoms.

10:08.175 --> 10:10.243
Have a little faith
in your father, Jimmy.

10:10.310 --> 10:11.511
You'll see.

10:11.578 --> 10:13.346
All I have to do
is write up a bid.

10:13.413 --> 10:16.650
In fact, I can probably
just update the last
proposal I worked on.

10:16.717 --> 10:18.318
Virginia!

10:18.385 --> 10:19.687
Have you seen my proposal?

10:19.753 --> 10:20.988
It's in a green notebook.

10:21.054 --> 10:24.624
I left it right here
15 years ago.

10:31.464 --> 10:34.101
Times New Roman... yeah...

10:34.167 --> 10:36.269
Courier... no...

10:36.336 --> 10:38.471
Lucida Grande, maybe?

10:38.538 --> 10:41.809
Ooh, Franklin Gothic Medium,
that's the ticket.

10:41.875 --> 10:44.111
It's a business proposal--
I don't think you're supposed

10:44.177 --> 10:45.979
to use a different font
for every letter.

10:46.046 --> 10:48.215
I'm just making it fun
for them to read.

10:48.281 --> 10:50.718
Besides, the proposal's
just a "formicality."

10:50.784 --> 10:52.019
The way Thumb
gets these jobs

10:52.085 --> 10:53.687
is wining and dining
the councilmen.

10:53.754 --> 10:56.223
That's the three D's:
Dinner, drinks,

10:56.289 --> 10:58.759
and triple-D cups
at a boobie bar.

11:00.761 --> 11:02.863
I gotta take
this bag boy job.

11:02.930 --> 11:04.531
All right, he's typing
a proposal with, like,

11:04.597 --> 11:05.532
a million
different fonts on it.

11:05.598 --> 11:06.599
It looks like a ransom note.

11:06.666 --> 11:07.801
(bell rings)

11:07.868 --> 11:09.336
Dinner's almost
ready, Maw Maw.

11:09.402 --> 11:10.503
It's your favorite.

11:10.570 --> 11:12.539
Chicken colada.

11:12.605 --> 11:13.974
Mom, you're not
listening to me.

11:14.041 --> 11:15.242
If I wait any longer,

11:15.308 --> 11:17.144
someone else is going to
take this bagging job.

11:17.210 --> 11:18.712
You want to break
your dad's heart?

11:18.779 --> 11:20.413
'Cause that's what you'll be
doing if you take that job.

11:20.480 --> 11:23.951
You're basically saying you
don't have any faith in him.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.618
But I'm somebody's
dad now, too,

11:25.685 --> 11:28.555
and it's my job to do
whatever I have to do
to take care of her.

11:28.621 --> 11:30.057
(sighs)

11:30.123 --> 11:31.959
Fine. Do what you got to do.

11:32.025 --> 11:33.460
But don't let
your dad find out.

11:33.526 --> 11:35.628
Hopefully, he'll get that
contract, and you can quit

11:35.695 --> 11:37.064
before he ever has to know.

11:37.130 --> 11:37.965
BURT (singsongy):
Good news.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.033
I found my old proposal.

11:40.100 --> 11:42.702
It had a Jerry Maguire theme.
Check it out.

11:44.337 --> 11:45.806
"Mow Me the Money."

11:45.873 --> 11:47.274
(laughing)

11:47.340 --> 11:49.042
Good, huh?

11:49.109 --> 11:51.311
(grunts)

11:51.378 --> 11:54.114
Hey, if I had seen
Jerry Maguire,

11:54.181 --> 11:55.749
would "Mow Me the Money"
be funny?

11:55.816 --> 11:58.786
Nope.
Go get that job.

12:00.320 --> 12:03.123
Well, your pal here
passed the urine test.

12:03.190 --> 12:05.292
Oh.
Meth, weed, X, crank,

12:05.358 --> 12:06.827
hillbilly heroin...
all negative.

12:06.894 --> 12:08.261
He watched me pee.

12:08.328 --> 12:09.329
Sabrina here

12:09.396 --> 12:10.864
will show you the ropes.

12:10.931 --> 12:12.399
We've got one rule
around here.

12:12.465 --> 12:13.700
Excellence.

12:13.767 --> 12:15.102
Anything less
is unacceptable.

12:15.168 --> 12:16.636
Anything more
is unrealistic.

12:16.703 --> 12:18.005
Just excellence.

12:18.071 --> 12:21.141
He watched me pee.

12:21.208 --> 12:23.610
Yeah. He made Sally
from produce watch me pee.

12:23.676 --> 12:25.312
Neither of us wanted
to be there.

12:25.378 --> 12:26.847
It was kind of a bummer.

12:28.215 --> 12:29.783
Here's what you
need to know.

12:29.850 --> 12:31.819
Behind the banana bin is
the only spot in the store

12:31.885 --> 12:34.387
the security cameras can't see
that gets cell phone reception.

12:34.454 --> 12:36.189
Yes. I'm calling

12:36.256 --> 12:39.927
about the used cheerleading
uniform you have for sale.

12:39.993 --> 12:41.694
That's the clock.

12:41.761 --> 12:42.762
Never look at the clock.

12:42.830 --> 12:44.297
The clock is your enemy.

12:44.364 --> 12:45.665
"Working at
a grocery store" time

12:45.732 --> 12:46.900
moves at about
one-third the speed

12:46.967 --> 12:48.635
of "not working
at a grocery store" time.

12:48.701 --> 12:50.270
Are you kidding me
right now?

12:50.337 --> 12:53.373
It was quarter to 6:00,
like, 45 minutes ago.

12:53.440 --> 12:56.176
How can it
still not be 6: 00?

12:56.243 --> 12:58.879
How could it
still not be 6:00?!

12:58.946 --> 13:00.780
(glass shattering)

13:00.848 --> 13:02.015
Is there anything
I should know

13:02.082 --> 13:03.350
about the actual
doing of the job?

13:03.416 --> 13:05.518
Take groceries.
Put them in a bag.

13:05.585 --> 13:07.154
Got it.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.789
Hey, peanut chew.
Did I wake you?

13:09.857 --> 13:11.191
Just working out
'cause Dad thinks

13:11.258 --> 13:12.359
I'm going
to the gym at night.

13:12.425 --> 13:14.694
(grunts)
Plus, it wouldn't hurt

13:14.761 --> 13:16.229
to fill our my apron
a little better.

13:16.296 --> 13:17.831
Now that I'm working
at the grocery store,

13:17.898 --> 13:19.332
I may as well look good
for Sabrina

13:19.399 --> 13:20.868
while I'm
getting us insurance.

13:20.934 --> 13:23.904
Two more weeks and you and me
can get as sick as we want.

13:23.971 --> 13:25.672
(laughing)
Maybe even sooner

13:25.738 --> 13:27.975
if Dad scores
that big city job.

13:28.041 --> 13:29.409
He's been fixing himself up

13:29.476 --> 13:31.678
for his big night out
with the councilmen

13:31.744 --> 13:34.181
and your grandmom's been making
him a cool outfit.

13:36.183 --> 13:39.987
If Grandpa succeeds,
I can quit the store.

13:40.053 --> 13:41.454
But either way,
you'll get insurance soon

13:41.521 --> 13:43.490
and be able
to see a real doctor.

13:43.556 --> 13:45.825
All I have to do

13:45.893 --> 13:47.394
is keep the job secret
from Grandpa.

13:47.460 --> 13:49.062
But that's cool.

13:49.129 --> 13:52.065
He never buys food anywhere
except the gas station.

13:56.736 --> 13:58.138
What the hell?

13:58.205 --> 14:00.507
He never buys food anywhere
except the gas station.

14:00.573 --> 14:02.675
Top of the evening to you.

14:02.742 --> 14:04.177
Ah, hey, Burt.

14:04.244 --> 14:06.646
Whoa. (chuckles)
That shirt is off the hook.

14:06.713 --> 14:07.714
Thanks.
Big night tonight.

14:07.780 --> 14:10.283
Entertaining business clients.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.719
So, uh...
Got a little tickle.

14:12.785 --> 14:15.622
I think I caught my
granddaughter's cold, so...

14:17.524 --> 14:19.092
(alarm wailing)

14:19.159 --> 14:21.494
James! James!
Guard the door!

14:21.561 --> 14:23.096
James?

14:23.163 --> 14:24.932
Where the hell
is James Chance?

14:24.998 --> 14:26.633
James Chance!
(alarm stops)

14:28.468 --> 14:30.170
(grunts)

14:30.237 --> 14:32.339
Hey, Dad.
(chuckles nervously)

14:32.405 --> 14:35.008
Wow.

14:35.075 --> 14:37.877
So you just
went ahead and...

14:37.945 --> 14:39.179
Oh, man.

14:39.246 --> 14:40.447
Dad, let me explain.

14:40.513 --> 14:42.115
No, no, no. You don't
need to explain.

14:42.182 --> 14:43.783
You didn't think I could
take care of business.

14:43.850 --> 14:45.485
Is this a meth business?

14:46.786 --> 14:48.055
You don't believe in me.

14:48.121 --> 14:49.256
I-I do. But--

14:49.322 --> 14:50.723
Fine. If you believe in me,

14:50.790 --> 14:51.925
then you don't need this job.

14:51.992 --> 14:53.593
So go ahead and quit.

14:54.962 --> 14:56.129
Right now.

15:00.333 --> 15:03.036
I'm gonna get
this contract,

15:03.103 --> 15:05.138
whether you believe
in me or not.

15:11.444 --> 15:13.280
(glass shatters)

15:13.346 --> 15:15.815
I've never seen him so hurt.

15:15.882 --> 15:17.850
I mean, that look
on his face.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.252
He was devastated.

15:19.319 --> 15:20.887
What are we gonna do?

15:20.954 --> 15:21.989
We?

15:22.055 --> 15:23.323
Well, you lied to him, too.

15:23.390 --> 15:24.924
I'm gonna tell him
I didn't know.

15:24.992 --> 15:26.193
I'll tell him that's not true.

15:26.259 --> 15:27.460
And who's he going to believe?

15:27.527 --> 15:28.495
His wife or his son

15:28.561 --> 15:30.830
that we've already
established is a liar?

15:30.897 --> 15:32.199
(door opens and closes)

15:45.645 --> 15:48.415
Well?

15:48.481 --> 15:49.649
How did it go?

15:49.716 --> 15:51.318
Oh.

15:51.384 --> 15:52.785
I got it.

15:52.852 --> 15:53.786
That's great!

15:53.853 --> 15:55.088
JIMMY: Oh my G--

15:55.155 --> 15:57.124
That's fantastic!
Yeah.

15:57.190 --> 15:59.392
Took Councilman Blake out.
Showed him a good time.

15:59.459 --> 16:01.928
It's called
wining and dining.

16:01.995 --> 16:03.763
Although, technically,
it was beer-ing

16:03.830 --> 16:05.665
and fried cheesesteak-ing.

16:05.732 --> 16:08.001
Dad...

16:08.068 --> 16:11.204
I'm so sorry I lied to you

16:11.271 --> 16:13.306
and I'm sorry I doubted you.

16:14.874 --> 16:15.942
Apology not accepted.

16:16.009 --> 16:17.477
Oh.

16:17.544 --> 16:20.180
Uh, okay.

16:21.581 --> 16:23.016
Uh, when do we
take over the parks?

16:23.083 --> 16:26.019
I start doing the parks
tomorrow, not you.

16:26.086 --> 16:27.120
I don't need to be

16:27.187 --> 16:28.155
spending my days with someone

16:28.221 --> 16:29.289
who doesn't believe in me.

16:29.356 --> 16:30.857
Now that we've
got all this

16:30.923 --> 16:32.159
extra work,
we'll split it up.

16:32.225 --> 16:35.195
You do residential,
and I do the parks.

16:37.130 --> 16:39.166
(clears throat)

16:39.232 --> 16:42.369
Oh. And you can quit your stupid
bagger job tomorrow night.

16:42.435 --> 16:44.204
My son isn't going
to be the low man

16:44.271 --> 16:45.638
on anyone's totem pole
but mine.

16:47.840 --> 16:50.510
That is so great, honey.

16:50.577 --> 16:51.911
I always knew

16:51.978 --> 16:54.013
you could do it.

17:16.769 --> 17:19.106
(brakes squeak)

17:38.425 --> 17:40.693
This area isn't done yet?

17:42.295 --> 17:43.430
Get on the umbrella.

17:43.496 --> 17:44.831
Let this idiot
show you how it's done.

18:14.994 --> 18:16.696
(bell ringing)

18:16.763 --> 18:20.367
You want cold soup? Ring
that damn bell one more time,

18:20.433 --> 18:22.435
and I'm bringing you
cold soup!

18:24.271 --> 18:26.206
That's what I thought.

18:26.273 --> 18:27.707
Is he here?

18:27.774 --> 18:28.941
No.

18:29.008 --> 18:31.744
He waited around, but then
he had to go to work

18:31.811 --> 18:33.180
at the grocery store.

18:36.783 --> 18:40.220
So I guess you didn't
really win that parks
contract last night.

18:40.287 --> 18:44.157
I thought I had it
all figured out.

18:44.224 --> 18:47.093
I'm glad I let you
talk me into this, Burt.

18:47.160 --> 18:50.730
When you mentioned
bikini bars, I thought,

18:50.797 --> 18:52.699
"Hey, I can't let my voters
see me in one of those."

18:52.765 --> 18:54.734
That's why I picked
one three towns over.

18:54.801 --> 18:55.735
Ah.

18:55.802 --> 18:57.604
I'm a thinker
and a mower.

18:57.670 --> 19:00.840
Mmm. I think you'll
be mowing parks real soon.

19:00.907 --> 19:02.342
Oh...

19:02.409 --> 19:04.544
Wait till you see the girl
I picked out for you.

19:04.611 --> 19:06.012
I asked around
and everyone said

19:06.078 --> 19:08.581
she's the craziest and
the wildest one here.
Mmm.

19:08.648 --> 19:10.617
(chuckles)
They call her
"Dirty Angel."

19:11.818 --> 19:13.753
Who's ready for a...

19:15.288 --> 19:16.489
Daddy?

19:16.556 --> 19:18.157
Punkin?

19:18.225 --> 19:21.694
It was a long,
quiet ride home.

19:21.761 --> 19:24.597
Pretty much the only
thing he said was,

19:24.664 --> 19:27.400
"Chance, you don't get
the parks contract."

19:27.467 --> 19:29.569
So it went to
Green Thumb.

19:29.636 --> 19:31.538
I figured if I could
secretly work for him,

19:31.604 --> 19:34.607
I could make enough
to buy Jimmy insurance.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.709
Burt...

19:36.776 --> 19:38.845
(sighs)

19:38.911 --> 19:41.147
Working two jobs,

19:41.214 --> 19:43.416
being the low man
on the totem pole.

19:43.483 --> 19:45.752
Taking crap
from a jerk boss.

19:45.818 --> 19:48.255
You're past all that.

19:48.321 --> 19:49.489
But the kid needs insurance.

19:49.556 --> 19:50.757
I'm his dad. It's my job
(sighs)

19:50.823 --> 19:53.192
to do whatever I have to
do to take care of him.

19:53.260 --> 19:54.527
And you did.

19:54.594 --> 19:57.897
By showing him his whole life
how do be a good dad.

19:59.832 --> 20:01.968
Now it's his turn
to take care of things.

20:02.034 --> 20:03.836
You got to let him do it.

20:03.903 --> 20:06.306
I don't like it.

20:06.373 --> 20:07.974
You don't have to.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.909
That's the way it is.

20:12.712 --> 20:15.582
Besides, it's not like you
don't have a new job to do.

20:19.151 --> 20:20.787
(sighs)

20:20.853 --> 20:22.522
Somebody's got
to start showing Jimmy

20:22.589 --> 20:25.091
how to be a good grandpa.

20:25.157 --> 20:26.426
(bell rings)

20:26.493 --> 20:28.995
Cold soup it is!

20:31.063 --> 20:33.400
I don't care if it's three towns
over or three states.

20:33.466 --> 20:35.768
Do not dance
in one of those clubs.

20:35.835 --> 20:39.339
But if you do, don't be the one
they call "Dirty Angel."

20:39.406 --> 20:41.240
(door opens)

20:41.308 --> 20:43.142
Oh. Hey.

20:43.209 --> 20:44.311
Hey.

20:44.377 --> 20:45.612
Listen, Dad,

20:45.678 --> 20:46.946
I'm really
sorry about...

20:47.013 --> 20:48.381
Nope.

20:48.448 --> 20:51.250
I was wrong. You did the right
thing, and I'm proud of you.

20:51.318 --> 20:52.919
Oh. Thanks.

20:52.985 --> 20:55.221
And I got you something.

20:55.288 --> 20:57.357
Oh.

20:57.424 --> 20:58.458
Did you eat your half
without me?

20:58.525 --> 21:01.394
Nope. Mashed my half up
and gave it to Hope.

21:01.461 --> 21:02.562
She can't have
that much sugar.

21:02.629 --> 21:03.596
She's gonna be...

21:03.663 --> 21:05.332
Up all night. I know.

21:05.398 --> 21:08.368
But that is not
a grandpa problem.

21:09.569 --> 21:11.604
Good night.
(laughs)

21:20.012 --> 21:21.781
Hang in there, Maw Maw.

21:21.848 --> 21:24.884
Hope's cold should be better
in a few days.

21:24.951 --> 21:27.286
(laughs)

21:27.354 --> 21:29.055
Agh!

21:29.121 --> 21:30.657
Get your mother!

21:30.723 --> 21:34.627
Get your mother!
Get your mother!

21:34.694 --> 21:35.762
CHILD: See you next week!

21:35.828 --> 21:37.664
(laughs)
