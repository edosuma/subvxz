WEBVTT

00:17.517 --> 00:19.477
It's in conformance
with the data from LIGO.

00:19.561 --> 00:22.022
The reading on the interferometer
is climbing, too.

00:22.105 --> 00:22.939
What's the origin?

00:23.356 --> 00:24.774
Report from the Maritime Force.

00:24.858 --> 00:28.319
125 miles northeast of Dogo Island
of the Oki Islands,

00:28.403 --> 00:31.072
the deserted island Sea Dragon Rock
is starting to swell.

00:43.543 --> 00:47.047
Then I'll be leaving the rest to you.

00:47.422 --> 00:49.758
-You can count on us!
-Be careful.

00:55.680 --> 00:56.848
Key Girl.

01:04.481 --> 01:06.316
Incoming message from the Yokota COC.

01:06.399 --> 01:11.071
An aircraft off the Noto Peninsula coast
has emerged. It is the large-scale OTF.

01:11.488 --> 01:12.781
It's finally time.

01:13.364 --> 01:14.365
<i>Ready to go?</i>

01:14.783 --> 01:15.617
Yes, ma'am!

01:21.414 --> 01:22.290
Roger.

03:24.370 --> 03:26.039
I never thought that old ha--

03:26.623 --> 03:29.417
that Ms. Hinomoto would
come back as a Dragon Pilot.

03:29.792 --> 03:35.757
The suit I developed for Kaizaki
that appeals to OTF came in handy.

03:37.592 --> 03:39.886
<i>OTF Flight, vector 310.</i>

03:40.053 --> 03:42.805
<i>Climb angle 20. Contact channel 1.</i>

03:43.223 --> 03:44.182
<i>Take care.</i>

03:44.349 --> 03:46.476
<i>OTF Flight. Roger.</i>

03:47.060 --> 03:47.894
<i>Thank you.</i>

03:49.229 --> 03:50.855
It begins at last.

03:55.401 --> 03:58.112
Entering the storm area momentarily.

03:58.905 --> 03:59.864
Oh my goodness.

04:01.658 --> 04:03.034
You're kidding, right?

04:07.622 --> 04:10.792
Remain calm. We've flown
this course before.

04:11.251 --> 04:12.752
We will make it.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.781
Visual contact on the target.

04:45.076 --> 04:46.494
It's been a while...

05:00.008 --> 05:02.385
He's bigger than Futomomo...

05:02.927 --> 05:06.764
<i>Penguin and Sada, please begin</i>
<i>escorting Lord Mitatsu.</i>

05:07.140 --> 05:08.099
<i>Roger.</i>

05:12.520 --> 05:16.733
<i>He'll snap at you coming from the sides.</i>
<i>Ride his slipstream and face him head on!</i>

05:17.025 --> 05:18.359
<i>Y-Yes, ma'am!</i>

05:42.383 --> 05:45.636
The large-scale OTF is rerouting to 1-5-0.

05:45.928 --> 05:47.013
The escort succeeded.

05:48.514 --> 05:51.809
In that case, shall we go
verify the target?

05:52.185 --> 05:53.895
Maezawa, Kogure,

05:54.020 --> 05:56.522
please contact us if anything happens.

05:56.606 --> 05:57.523
Roger!

05:59.901 --> 06:01.444
Please take me with you!

06:02.862 --> 06:06.074
-Airman 3rd Class Kaizaki?
-I want to see their work up close.

06:06.449 --> 06:08.868
I can assist with maintenance
if something happens!

06:09.243 --> 06:11.954
And even if I can't fly,

06:12.246 --> 06:14.040
I am still a Dragon Pilot!

06:14.123 --> 06:15.625
Kaizaki...

06:16.376 --> 06:19.087
Understood. You are permitted
to come along.

06:20.254 --> 06:21.381
Thank you very much!

06:29.847 --> 06:31.557
<i>What are you doing?</i>

06:37.814 --> 06:40.650
<i>I wonder... what she is doing now.</i>

06:43.611 --> 06:47.532
WHAT IS HISONE AMAKASU DOING?

06:47.615 --> 06:50.660
Goro. Purr, purr, purr.

06:50.743 --> 06:53.704
Goro! Purr, purr, purr.

06:54.038 --> 06:57.750
Oh, Goro, why won't you purr for me?

06:58.292 --> 06:59.752
Goro.

07:02.630 --> 07:04.841
Hisone gonna be all right?

07:05.049 --> 07:07.593
She came this far, ya know.
She did good.

07:07.677 --> 07:09.470
She's gotta be hungry, ya?

07:09.554 --> 07:11.806
Make her some inari sushi.

07:12.014 --> 07:13.724
<i>I'm making them worry.</i>

07:15.017 --> 07:16.769
<i>I suddenly quit my job,</i>

07:16.894 --> 07:19.021
<i>didn't give so much as a reason why,</i>

07:19.272 --> 07:24.610
<i>and now they're gonna stuff me</i>
<i>some sweet inari sushi.</i>

07:25.278 --> 07:30.032
<i>How did scum like me</i>
<i>come from such a kind couple?</i>

07:31.451 --> 07:33.911
Scum... like me.

07:35.663 --> 07:38.082
You're quitting...
the Air Self-Defense Force?

07:38.374 --> 07:39.584
Yes. I'm quitting.

07:39.667 --> 07:41.794
H-Hang on a second.

07:41.919 --> 07:44.672
Right now, before the Ritual,
is a critical moment...

07:44.755 --> 07:46.048
Technical Sergeant Amakasu,

07:46.757 --> 07:48.509
How did you arrive to that conclusion?

07:49.635 --> 07:52.180
I like Okonogi!

07:52.638 --> 07:55.183
Y-You don't... mince words.

07:55.266 --> 07:58.644
Yes. But... I also love Masotan!

07:59.228 --> 08:02.523
There was nothing
that was precious to me before.

08:02.940 --> 08:04.567
Just my parents, and Goro,

08:04.692 --> 08:08.863
the DeAgostini weekly "Global Western
House" series I'm in the middle of,

08:09.030 --> 08:11.240
oh, and an autograph
from the athlete Shinjo.

08:11.616 --> 08:13.409
You have quite a list...

08:13.493 --> 08:15.995
But it's not just Okonogi.

08:16.120 --> 08:17.663
Nao, El,

08:17.747 --> 08:19.207
Hitomi, Lilikos,

08:19.332 --> 08:22.335
Commander Sosoda
and Flight Leader Kakiyasu, too.

08:22.418 --> 08:24.962
My point is that I've come
to cherish many people now!

08:25.046 --> 08:30.968
If my uncertainty about Okonogi is causing
problems for other people I care about,

08:31.093 --> 08:32.303
then I can't stand it.

08:32.386 --> 08:33.721
No, no, no,

08:33.888 --> 08:37.099
it's an even bigger problem for us
if you resign now--

08:37.183 --> 08:38.267
However!

08:38.476 --> 08:41.437
I also cannot stop
my feelings for Okonogi.

08:42.313 --> 08:46.317
And most importantly,
I can't put Masotan in such a tough place.

08:46.734 --> 08:50.404
I want to continue saying that the things
that I cherish are important.

08:50.905 --> 08:53.991
That is why I will quit my position
in the Air Self-Defense Force.

08:55.076 --> 08:57.828
Don't rush into your decision.

08:58.037 --> 08:59.956
We can find a way around the anastomo--

09:00.039 --> 09:01.749
-Understood!
-Huh?

09:02.792 --> 09:04.252
Flight Leader Kakiyasu!

09:06.170 --> 09:07.713
Pack your bags!

09:08.923 --> 09:10.716
Flight Leader Kakiyasu--

09:10.800 --> 09:12.802
Did you feel nothing?!

09:13.386 --> 09:16.389
Towards your training here
or life with your comrades?!

09:16.514 --> 09:18.099
T-That's what I meant by importa--

09:18.182 --> 09:19.892
Shut up, you scum!

09:20.309 --> 09:24.146
If that's your excuse for quitting
the Air Self-Defense Force,

09:24.397 --> 09:26.732
then we don't need scum like you here!

09:26.816 --> 09:27.650
Quit?

09:28.818 --> 09:29.694
Get the hell out.

09:30.152 --> 09:31.070
Right now.

09:32.405 --> 09:35.032
I don't want to see your face!

09:38.619 --> 09:40.997
Does that mean I'm a bad person?

09:41.956 --> 09:46.961
No matter how you look at it,
I really am no good.

09:48.921 --> 09:50.423
Ah, Goro!

09:50.506 --> 09:51.924
Goro.

09:52.008 --> 09:56.429
If you go wandering off, you never know
what's out there to get you.

10:00.558 --> 10:02.059
You're going to get all dusty.

10:05.479 --> 10:08.399
AOKI HIGH SCHOOL TOYAMA, PREFECTURE

10:13.738 --> 10:16.157
<i>I was out of the loop,</i>
<i>if I say so myself.</i>

10:17.366 --> 10:19.368
<i>I just forced myself in with my peers.</i>

10:20.411 --> 10:21.579
<i>As far as friends go,</i>

10:22.371 --> 10:24.081
<i>I didn't have a single one.</i>

10:26.208 --> 10:27.543
<i>Going out for drinks,</i>

10:28.044 --> 10:30.296
<i>trading side dishes we didn't like,</i>

10:30.838 --> 10:32.548
<i>stargazing...</i>

10:34.884 --> 10:36.427
<i>going to the movies...</i>

10:37.887 --> 10:39.221
<i>All of it</i>

10:39.889 --> 10:41.015
<i>was a first experience.</i>

10:41.098 --> 10:43.476
JOIN THE SELF-DEFENSE FORCE
TO PROTECT WHAT I CHERISH

10:47.772 --> 10:49.398
<i>Protect what I...</i>

10:50.066 --> 10:50.900
<i>cherish.</i>

10:52.068 --> 10:56.739
<i>Hiso Maso!</i>

11:01.702 --> 11:04.455
The large-scale OTF is entering
a stable trajectory.

11:04.997 --> 11:06.624
Everything is on schedule.

11:07.041 --> 11:10.878
At this rate, we'll reach
the sleep turnover point smoothly.

11:12.380 --> 11:14.548
This guy is really leisurely.

11:17.259 --> 11:19.845
Are you thinking about Amakasu?

11:21.430 --> 11:23.933
I might be dragging it around even now,

11:24.517 --> 11:28.396
the pain of not being chosen...
to be a Dragon Pilot.

11:29.522 --> 11:32.942
Even your man
was taken by a Dragon Pilot...

11:34.735 --> 11:35.569
Man?

11:36.487 --> 11:39.740
Regardless, I decided to serve as a member
of the Self-Defense Force

11:39.824 --> 11:42.702
and support the Dragon Pilots
through training.

11:43.494 --> 11:45.663
That may sound good,

11:46.330 --> 11:48.791
but my dream remains suspended in limbo,

11:49.041 --> 11:52.378
and I may have affixed it onto
Technical Sergeant Amakasu.

12:02.054 --> 12:06.767
Technical Sergeant Amakasu's actions are
by no means admirable.

12:07.435 --> 12:10.938
But for me, it was a blessing.

12:13.816 --> 12:16.068
Yes. There's a good boy.

12:16.694 --> 12:18.070
Keep moving forward,

12:19.196 --> 12:21.198
to Yae's side.

12:23.075 --> 12:24.410
I want you to stop after all.

12:24.994 --> 12:28.456
Even if it's for the country,
the thought of losing you

12:28.998 --> 12:31.000
is unbearable.

12:31.250 --> 12:33.669
I want to go to Paris.

12:34.712 --> 12:35.671
Yae...

12:36.172 --> 12:38.674
All right. Let's go there.

12:38.966 --> 12:40.968
We'll ride the Organic Transformed Fli--

12:41.552 --> 12:42.762
Montparnasse.

12:43.345 --> 12:45.931
We secretly decided
that's his name, right?

12:47.016 --> 12:47.850
Yeah.

12:48.058 --> 12:50.936
Let's ride Montparnasse
and escape to Paris.

13:02.656 --> 13:03.991
After leaving the village,

13:04.450 --> 13:06.619
I'm so glad the first friend I made...

13:07.411 --> 13:08.537
was you.

13:09.330 --> 13:10.414
Sada, dear.

13:20.466 --> 13:22.802
We're receiving an emergency signal
from Serpent!

13:23.260 --> 13:25.262
W-What is going on?!

13:25.638 --> 13:27.807
It seems that anastomosis has begun.

13:27.890 --> 13:29.350
Can you hear me, Sada?

13:29.558 --> 13:31.185
-What's your status--
-<i>Montparnasse.</i>

13:32.061 --> 13:35.773
Montparnasse, we threw away everything.

13:36.232 --> 13:40.069
To support you, to fly with you!

13:40.569 --> 13:41.403
And yet,

13:41.821 --> 13:44.740
why won't you choose me?!

13:45.074 --> 13:47.993
Are my sins too deep?!

13:48.327 --> 13:49.745
Montparnasse!

13:58.170 --> 14:00.005
-Masotan!
-<i>Keep calm!</i>

14:00.339 --> 14:02.550
<i>Our job is to escort Lord Mitatsu!</i>

14:03.968 --> 14:05.928
Serpent's deviating
from the dragon's route!

14:06.428 --> 14:07.763
Where is she flying?!

14:07.930 --> 14:10.808
Forty miles northeast of Komatsu.

14:11.141 --> 14:14.061
It's closest to...
the Toyama rendezvous point!

14:15.938 --> 14:19.692
Sada, try to lure the OTF
in that direction.

14:20.401 --> 14:22.903
That girl is in Toyama, isn't she?

14:26.115 --> 14:28.742
What's this? The rain started so suddenly.

14:29.243 --> 14:31.245
Hisone, come help.

14:46.510 --> 14:49.638
Oh no! The towel is flying away!

14:49.972 --> 14:51.724
-I heard it.
-Huh?

14:52.933 --> 14:55.311
I heard... Masotan's voice!

14:57.396 --> 14:58.606
Masotan?

15:01.859 --> 15:04.987
Promptly reserve the rendezvous point
and get official notice.

15:05.070 --> 15:06.906
F-Flight Leader Kakiyasu!

15:07.615 --> 15:09.533
There's... a text.

15:09.909 --> 15:10.743
A text?

15:10.826 --> 15:12.077
It's from Amakasu!

15:13.162 --> 15:14.747
-Let me see that!
-Hey!

15:15.664 --> 15:17.082
I'M SORRY!

15:17.499 --> 15:18.334
I WILL HURRY!

15:18.834 --> 15:21.086
Oh, the White Lover is...

15:21.211 --> 15:23.672
Contact her immediately
to get to the rendezvous--

15:23.797 --> 15:25.633
She is a private citizen!

15:26.133 --> 15:27.217
Kakiyasu.

15:27.509 --> 15:30.346
Endangering citizens' lives
is a serious offense!

15:32.056 --> 15:33.766
She ran away!

15:36.936 --> 15:37.937
I must go.

15:39.188 --> 15:41.148
It doesn't matter if it's a misconception.

15:41.357 --> 15:42.900
I must go.

15:43.484 --> 15:44.318
Because...

15:45.069 --> 15:46.820
Masotan is calling for me!

15:49.281 --> 15:50.115
Huh?

15:59.208 --> 16:00.292
Are you okay?

16:05.422 --> 16:07.883
F-Flight Leader Kakiyasu.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.218
Amakasu?!

16:09.385 --> 16:10.386
Amakasu.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.513
Why are you here?

16:13.013 --> 16:17.851
I am very sorry!

16:21.981 --> 16:23.774
Now you want to apologize?

16:23.857 --> 16:26.694
I wrote that I want to protect
the people I cherish!

16:27.945 --> 16:30.322
I really hadn't thought about that.

16:30.447 --> 16:33.742
Like I said before,
there wasn't much I cared about.

16:33.909 --> 16:35.953
"But why the Air Self-Defense Force?"

16:36.036 --> 16:38.497
"Because you couldn't get
into other schools, right?"

16:38.580 --> 16:40.958
I didn't want the other girls
to whisper about me!

16:41.041 --> 16:44.294
But I was told to write
something I put thought into!

16:44.962 --> 16:47.256
I don't have time for your sob story--

16:47.339 --> 16:49.008
I didn't understand

16:49.633 --> 16:51.719
what it was that I cherished

16:51.802 --> 16:53.387
and what to do about it!

16:53.470 --> 16:57.141
I said I wanted to continue
saying what I cherished,

16:57.558 --> 17:01.228
But that was not good enough!

17:01.729 --> 17:03.397
You must protect

17:03.897 --> 17:06.150
the things you cherish!

17:07.192 --> 17:08.027
Amakasu...

17:09.361 --> 17:10.904
Are you finished talking?

17:11.196 --> 17:13.782
K-Kakiyasu...

17:14.116 --> 17:16.410
Why don't you try
thinking about it calmly?

17:16.744 --> 17:20.372
We don't have time for people
who can't board the OTF.

17:20.456 --> 17:23.709
You try thinking calmly about it too,
Flight Leader Kakiyasu!

17:24.043 --> 17:24.877
Huh?

17:25.294 --> 17:27.504
The people who are important to me,

17:27.713 --> 17:29.715
everyone, including Okonogi,

17:30.090 --> 17:32.885
are all people I met through Masotan!

17:33.427 --> 17:38.474
In other words, I cherish Masotan the most
because he brought us together.

17:38.974 --> 17:41.018
If I can convey that feeling to Masotan,

17:41.685 --> 17:44.897
I believe I can definitely board him!

17:45.898 --> 17:46.774
Please,

17:47.357 --> 17:51.153
let me ride Masotan one more time!

17:53.030 --> 17:55.866
You're really good at running your mouth.

17:57.409 --> 17:59.328
You blurt out what you think immediately.

17:59.411 --> 18:03.332
To get to the top shelf,
you'll step on others with muddy feet.

18:03.916 --> 18:06.668
T-That's exactly right, but...

18:06.752 --> 18:09.713
But you aren't a liar.

18:10.964 --> 18:13.592
Flight Leader Kakiyasu...

18:18.555 --> 18:19.807
I'll let you do it.

18:21.058 --> 18:22.392
I'll let you do all of it.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.645
Hurry up and board,

18:24.728 --> 18:26.355
Technical Sergeant Amakasu!

18:27.564 --> 18:28.857
Kakiyasu.

18:32.903 --> 18:33.737
Yes, ma'am!

18:35.239 --> 18:37.908
At present, the OTF is
in an uncontrollable state.

18:38.367 --> 18:39.993
Add in the weather,

18:40.119 --> 18:42.871
and a transfer in a best condition
is impossible.

18:43.330 --> 18:47.000
Therefore, we'll have the OTF
fly at a low elevation,

18:47.543 --> 18:50.129
and swallow the White Lover like that.

18:51.046 --> 18:54.216
If this doesn't go well, we can only hope
to be fired and nothing more.

18:54.967 --> 18:56.009
Masotan,

18:57.219 --> 18:59.847
Flight Leader Kakiyasu acknowledged me.

19:00.639 --> 19:01.598
Masotan...

19:04.977 --> 19:06.395
I'm coming for you,

19:06.937 --> 19:09.231
Masotan!

19:13.485 --> 19:15.320
I"m feeling a little weak...

19:15.404 --> 19:16.405
Go!

19:17.364 --> 19:20.868
I'm at a disadvantage!

19:35.507 --> 19:36.758
She did it!

19:38.927 --> 19:42.848
I'm sorry, Masotan!
Everything will be fine now.

19:43.640 --> 19:47.019
Technical Sergeant Amakasu,
hurry and control him...

19:57.571 --> 19:59.740
Oh, Masotan!

19:59.823 --> 20:02.117
You're such a good boy!

20:02.201 --> 20:03.493
Thank you!

20:05.871 --> 20:08.040
I can't hold it anymore.
I'm gonna barf.

20:08.165 --> 20:12.711
Everyone, Technical Sergeant Amakasu
has joined us!

20:12.794 --> 20:14.671
Please be patient a little longer...

20:14.755 --> 20:15.839
Amakasu?!

20:18.967 --> 20:20.969
That girl is dishonest.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.960
The gravitational vector is fluctuating.

20:53.543 --> 20:55.629
What exactly is happening?

21:04.554 --> 21:05.681
It is time.

21:06.598 --> 21:07.891
The Ritual

21:08.183 --> 21:13.146
will begin with a song by the miko to put
Lord Mitatsu to sleep.

21:13.522 --> 21:17.609
Then, by cutting the Shimenawa rope
that ties the two tails,

21:17.859 --> 21:21.280
the body is rolled over
from top to bottom.

21:22.656 --> 21:24.658
Be calm, be still,

21:24.783 --> 21:26.451
behave, be composed.

21:27.035 --> 21:29.454
-On this night...
-After the rolling,

21:29.663 --> 21:33.083
for a second time,
the miko will ring their bells

21:33.166 --> 21:36.503
and send Lord Mitatsu
into Fushido, his bedchamber.

21:36.878 --> 21:40.090
...the Key Girl will serve you,
summon the miko.

21:40.757 --> 21:45.387
Watch for a thousand years
from the heavens...

21:48.473 --> 21:50.851
Oh, I can hear them!

21:51.351 --> 21:52.936
It has begun.

21:53.061 --> 21:56.189
If all goes well,
it's our turn to do the rolling.

21:56.273 --> 21:57.357
Yae...

21:58.483 --> 21:59.693
Ms. Sada?

21:59.776 --> 22:01.361
P-Please wait!

22:01.820 --> 22:04.990
<i>Ms. Sada is being a wandering old person!</i>

22:06.116 --> 22:09.202
Confronting destiny...

22:09.745 --> 22:11.455
Ms. Sada!

22:16.126 --> 22:17.294
Yae...

22:19.671 --> 22:23.133
You're not alone anymore, Yae.

22:23.216 --> 22:24.634
Ms. Sada?

22:24.968 --> 22:27.512
I was like you.

22:27.929 --> 22:31.808
I turned my back on the mission

22:32.976 --> 22:36.188
because I learned of the truth.

22:36.396 --> 22:37.898
Truth?

22:40.359 --> 22:41.818
For the Ritual,

22:43.820 --> 22:46.031
a sacrifice is required.

22:47.282 --> 22:49.993
TO BE CONTINUED

24:20.667 --> 24:24.504
<i>Masotan!</i>

24:24.754 --> 24:25.672
<i>Masotan.</i>

24:29.885 --> 24:32.679
<i>I love you!</i>

24:41.771 --> 24:44.983
