01:17.381 --> 01:19.600
- It's a new year.
- And a new day.

01:19.970 --> 01:21.720
Finally we can get back to normal.

01:26.310 --> 01:27.360
Turner!

01:29.020 --> 01:32.990
Hauling and landfill costs: $996.

01:33.650 --> 01:38.410
Turf resurfacing: $1,356.

01:38.620 --> 01:41.120
Labor: $980.

01:41.200 --> 01:45.102
Oh, and pain and suffering: $22.95.

01:45.149 --> 01:46.250
Pain and suffering?

01:46.330 --> 01:49.880
That's the cost of a case of beer
for dealing with all of this shit.

01:50.420 --> 01:53.010
Which brings the total football field
repair cost

01:53.090 --> 01:57.970
to $4,616.71.

01:58.430 --> 02:00.470
So let me bottom-line this for you, son,

02:00.560 --> 02:01.912
since I know a kid like you

02:01.949 --> 02:03.926
doesn't have that kind
of cash lying around.

02:05.520 --> 02:06.600
That's right.

02:07.270 --> 02:10.520
Until you work off every dollar
of that amount...

02:12.280 --> 02:13.650
I own you.

02:14.820 --> 02:17.360
Not cool. So not cool.

02:22.830 --> 02:24.080
What?

02:24.660 --> 02:25.710
Ugh!

02:26.710 --> 02:27.960
Gotta be Tyrone.

02:32.840 --> 02:33.890
Hello?

02:36.130 --> 02:37.510
Hello?

02:40.600 --> 02:41.720
Tyrone?

02:45.020 --> 02:46.390
Tyrone?

02:54.820 --> 02:55.870
It's okay.

02:56.940 --> 02:58.110
Nothing to worry about.

02:58.610 --> 02:59.660
It's daylight...

02:59.721 --> 03:01.041
and... and... and nothing ever happens

03:01.077 --> 03:03.898
in the locker rooms, so...
it's all right.

03:04.080 --> 03:05.580
You're good.

03:11.580 --> 03:12.750
Tyrone!

03:31.230 --> 03:32.480
Guys, I got eyes on me.

03:32.560 --> 03:35.860
Me too. The post-shooting lookie-loos
are out in full force.

03:36.030 --> 03:37.280
Oh, Ruby!

03:39.360 --> 03:40.950
Thank you.

03:41.360 --> 03:43.410
I don't know how much longer
I can be Bullet Boy.

03:43.490 --> 03:45.030
I just wanna get back to normal.

03:45.067 --> 03:46.262
Normal?

03:46.299 --> 03:48.049
Baby, you ain't never been normal!

03:48.120 --> 03:50.830
You got that special sauce flowing
through your veins.

03:50.960 --> 03:54.130
And probably all over that juicy Nalga!

03:55.630 --> 03:57.550
Ruby said I could sit with y'all, so...

03:58.340 --> 03:59.880
Shoot! I forgot dessert.

03:59.970 --> 04:01.840
Oh, you sit. I got you.

04:01.930 --> 04:05.390
Sugar-free sweets for my
super-sweet treat, coming right up!

04:08.140 --> 04:09.270
I'm sorry!

04:09.350 --> 04:10.631
But ever since my brush with death,

04:10.668 --> 04:12.386
I made a bargain with the big man.

04:12.440 --> 04:13.490
Or woman?

04:14.020 --> 04:15.650
Let's say the universe will be
gender-neutral.

04:15.980 --> 04:18.690
But part of that deal was
to work on my karmic energy,

04:18.779 --> 04:21.529
be a better person,
so shit wouldn't go sideways again.

04:22.240 --> 04:25.700
Part of that deal is to do charity,
and Jasmine is my charity.

04:25.990 --> 04:28.040
Couldn't you have saved
a rain forest instead?

04:28.120 --> 04:29.580
See? I knew this would be an issue.

04:29.660 --> 04:32.960
Speaking of commitment,
we need to make one.

04:33.290 --> 04:35.290
What are we gonna do with the cheddar?

04:35.540 --> 04:37.170
We need a plan of action ASAP.

04:37.250 --> 04:39.710
First thing after school,
all-hands meeting.

04:40.260 --> 04:43.220
This kind of gouda
can get ripe real quick.

04:43.300 --> 04:45.510
I'm not sure we can handle it
if people start sniffing around.

04:45.760 --> 04:48.260
- Cheesy. But I like it.
- Yes!

04:48.810 --> 04:50.770
Right now,
the money as is makes us targets.

04:50.882 --> 04:52.507
We need to move quickly
to wash the cash

04:52.544 --> 04:54.288
so we can use it and
help Cesar survive.

04:54.336 --> 04:55.389
Yes.

04:55.440 --> 04:57.230
Okay. So where are we meeting?

04:57.690 --> 04:59.360
My dad is coming home this afternoon.

04:59.610 --> 05:01.280
Okay, so we can't do it at Monse's,

05:01.490 --> 05:03.610
my house is pretty tense
post-dig debacle,

05:03.950 --> 05:05.570
and Cesar never hosts.
So, Ruby, it's you.

05:05.660 --> 05:07.240
No. Your mom doesn't want me around.

05:07.330 --> 05:09.740
Oh, my mom's got a job all week,
so we're good.

05:09.990 --> 05:11.370
My house after school.

05:11.700 --> 05:12.910
- All right.
- Cool.

05:14.878 --> 05:16.753
Sorry I didn't tell you Dad was coming,

05:16.790 --> 05:18.044
but I didn't wanna stress you out.

05:18.090 --> 05:20.710
And I know it's even more stressful
to find out the last minute.

05:20.800 --> 05:23.010
But you never wanna talk about it
'cause then you worry.

05:23.090 --> 05:24.692
So instead of having
you worry about it,

05:24.729 --> 05:26.756
I worry about it and solve the problem.

05:26.807 --> 05:28.784
I appreciate that you're
trying to help, but...

05:28.892 --> 05:30.813
I could have figured it out myself.

05:30.850 --> 05:32.310
But you don't need to.

05:32.390 --> 05:34.310
You have me,
and I figured it out for you.

05:34.390 --> 05:36.770
And what I figured out was a hostel!

05:37.059 --> 05:38.489
I have enough money

05:38.526 --> 05:39.864
to pay for 3 nights.

05:39.900 --> 05:41.980
I don't wanna take your money. You know.

05:42.070 --> 05:45.070
But we can't spend
the RollerWorld money until it's clean.

05:45.150 --> 05:47.990
So you have to take money from someone,
and it might as well be me.

05:51.450 --> 05:52.950
You just don't quit, do you?

05:53.160 --> 05:54.210
Why would I?

05:54.540 --> 05:56.920
Wait a minute.Â Remember my mom/non-mom?

05:57.000 --> 05:58.630
The woman who I thought was my mom?

05:58.710 --> 06:00.148
She asked me to babysit a few times

06:00.185 --> 06:01.456
last week when I wasn't available,

06:01.500 --> 06:04.050
but she texted me about another job,
a bigger job.

06:04.590 --> 06:06.050
You mean she texted Laura.

06:06.970 --> 06:09.600
She needs a teenager to consult
for the book she's writing.

06:09.800 --> 06:11.347
Hmm. So I guess

06:11.384 --> 06:13.216
none of what I just said
about me trying to figure out

06:13.270 --> 06:15.640
the situation on my own resonated.

06:16.520 --> 06:19.440
Monse. You're gonna text her now,
aren't you?

06:37.370 --> 06:38.920
We have to move the money.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.710
I can't be the keeper alone.
It's not safe.

06:41.340 --> 06:44.050
Abuelita, I reserved the table
for a two-hour block.

06:44.130 --> 06:45.460
Didn't you see my note on the fridge?

06:47.630 --> 06:49.800
It's fine. She knows about the money.

06:50.890 --> 06:54.010
Okay. Well, since we found the money,
I've done copious research.

06:54.100 --> 06:55.430
This is why we're best friends.

06:55.520 --> 06:56.930
- You're best friends?
- Yeah.

06:57.100 --> 06:58.350
You guys get to make out,

06:58.440 --> 07:01.690
we get to be best friends.
It's a trade-off. Bestie, present.

07:06.740 --> 07:09.700
Ew! And no!

07:12.370 --> 07:15.410
Okay, team! We have 37-year-old cash

07:15.490 --> 07:17.540
that we can't spend
without raising eyebrows.

07:17.620 --> 07:19.210
And we've all seen Breaking Bad.

07:19.290 --> 07:20.460
We need a cash business.

07:20.540 --> 07:22.420
Twenty, 40, 60...

07:22.500 --> 07:25.460
Abuelita, please! We're trying to think
how to clean the money.

07:25.750 --> 07:27.880
Jamal, your dad literally
owns a business.

07:27.946 --> 07:29.431
No way. My dad's

07:29.484 --> 07:31.324
super particular about the books.
It would never work.

07:31.360 --> 07:34.970
But what if we started our own business?

07:35.060 --> 07:36.720
How's Ruben's Fancy Festivities
coming along?

07:37.070 --> 07:38.891
At least three years away from launch,

07:38.928 --> 07:41.401
pending a Silicon Beach cash infusion.

07:41.440 --> 07:44.900
Four hundred and sixty plus 260...

07:45.270 --> 07:46.440
Seven-twenty.

07:46.570 --> 07:49.070
Aah! I put down too much.

07:51.820 --> 07:53.450
- Hello.
- Hi!

07:53.530 --> 07:56.120
I'm shopping, was thinking about getting
you a button-up.

07:56.200 --> 07:59.160
- Cool. Gotta go.
- Wait! Wait! What size is your neck?

07:59.620 --> 08:01.870
- I don't know! Average?
<i>- Average?</i>

08:01.960 --> 08:03.010
Wait! Wait! Wait!

08:05.040 --> 08:06.380
Jamal, measure my neck.

08:06.460 --> 08:09.590
Okay, no.
You need to give me your phone.

08:09.800 --> 08:12.300
This is not a joke.
We're trying to move the money,

08:12.380 --> 08:14.640
and you're here playing
twiddly-thumbs with Jazmaspaz.

08:14.720 --> 08:16.970
- Just don't text her back.
- As if it were that easy!

08:17.060 --> 08:19.020
I have a moral obligation to reply.

08:19.100 --> 08:20.150
Or what?

08:20.270 --> 08:22.106
The universe is going
to strike you down?

08:22.143 --> 08:23.206
Maybe!

08:23.243 --> 08:25.493
You know what?
I'm calling it for today.

08:25.530 --> 08:26.779
I think we're hitting a wall.

08:26.980 --> 08:29.780
Let's reconvene tomorrow
after a good night's sleep.

08:31.484 --> 08:32.534
Take your damn...

08:32.570 --> 08:34.679
The thing about getting
a good night's sleep

08:34.716 --> 08:36.655
is you actually need to sleep.

08:36.700 --> 08:38.330
Don't you understand what's at stake?

08:38.409 --> 08:40.909
I do and I want to do
everything I can to help,

08:41.000 --> 08:43.250
but we've been on the phone for hours.
We're not getting anywhere.

08:43.330 --> 08:46.380
I mean, 200k in this neighborhood,
who wouldn't be paranoid?

08:46.460 --> 08:48.500
No one knows about the money.
Give it a rest.

08:48.590 --> 08:50.760
- And get away from the window.
- I'm not at the window.

08:51.050 --> 08:52.880
- I'm hanging up now.
- No! Don't...

08:54.050 --> 08:55.100
Hello?

08:56.680 --> 08:58.560
Jamal!

09:17.410 --> 09:18.620
This hostel is bullshit!

09:18.700 --> 09:21.200
I paid my money. Get out of my bed!

09:29.294 --> 09:30.344
Just relax.

09:37.970 --> 09:39.020
It isn't real.

09:40.100 --> 09:42.270
It's just a manifestation
of your anxiety.

09:43.020 --> 09:45.600
When you open your eyes,
it will be gone.

09:51.320 --> 09:53.860
Dude, we need to
relocate the green fast.

09:53.940 --> 09:55.530
Like crazy fast, 'cause I'm going crazy.

09:55.602 --> 09:58.312
I feel you. I didn't sleep more
than a couple hours last night.

09:58.357 --> 09:59.453
A couple hours?

09:59.490 --> 10:00.553
Then you don't get to complain.

10:00.590 --> 10:02.576
'Cause I'm talking
totalÂ sleep deprivation.

10:02.620 --> 10:03.670
Like no sleep.

10:03.750 --> 10:06.370
You know, maybe Ruby was onto something
with this whole karmaÂ thing.

10:06.460 --> 10:09.250
Maybe I need to make amends
for digging up school property.

10:09.340 --> 10:11.670
- Isn't that what you're doing?
- Yes, but it goes deeper than that.

10:11.880 --> 10:14.880
Maybe I screwed someone over
in the process of getting the money.

10:14.970 --> 10:16.180
- Who?
- No one.

10:16.630 --> 10:19.180
Nothing. I'm just playing around
with a "what if?"

10:19.350 --> 10:20.720
Oh. No, I get it.

10:21.010 --> 10:24.520
Like what if I wash my clothes
with those towels?

10:24.810 --> 10:25.860
No biggie, but...

10:26.770 --> 10:28.028
it's not the cleanest machine.

10:28.065 --> 10:29.516
I really have no other option 'cause...

10:29.560 --> 10:30.860
You're cheap. I know.

10:38.160 --> 10:40.570
- What?
- You have muscles. I can use those!

10:41.200 --> 10:43.290
Meet me at my house after school.
I need protection.

10:43.370 --> 10:44.420
Protection from what?

10:44.620 --> 10:47.620
Doesn't matter. I need you to be
my bagman. My bodyguard.

10:47.790 --> 10:49.380
Um. A bagman isn't a bodyguard.

10:49.460 --> 10:51.790
- Whatever, it's the same thing.
- No, it's really not.

10:52.040 --> 10:53.250
A man carries a bag...

10:54.050 --> 10:55.100
he's a bagman.

10:55.170 --> 10:56.510
It's in the bag!

10:56.590 --> 10:57.720
I got the job!

10:57.840 --> 11:00.145
Now I'll have enough money
to loan you until, you know,

11:00.182 --> 11:01.426
something's washed.

11:01.470 --> 11:02.845
After that, we won't have to worry.

11:02.882 --> 11:04.556
You can stay at the
hostel indefinitely.

11:05.350 --> 11:06.400
Indefinitely?

11:07.140 --> 11:09.440
Or not. What's wrong with the hostel?

11:09.940 --> 11:10.990
You hate it?

11:11.190 --> 11:13.150
Are there random pubes on your pillows?

11:13.270 --> 11:15.690
That might have been mentioned
in the Yelp review.

11:15.780 --> 11:17.740
No, it's fine. More than fine.

11:17.900 --> 11:19.490
Might as well be The Queen Mary.

11:19.570 --> 11:21.530
- Isn't that a ship?
- And a hotel.

11:21.620 --> 11:22.990
It's supposed to be haunted.

11:23.080 --> 11:26.200
Speaking of paranormal,
I think Jasmine might be the Candyman.

11:26.290 --> 11:27.870
I'm starting to feel really paranoid.

11:27.960 --> 11:31.130
It's like every time I say her name
a few times, she just appears.

11:32.710 --> 11:34.040
Sorry. Did I scare you?

11:34.590 --> 11:36.210
There's a lot of that
going around lately.

11:36.300 --> 11:39.090
It's like one second you're minding
your own business and then bam!

11:39.170 --> 11:41.180
Beady eyes and rosy cheeks
staring right at you.

11:41.236 --> 11:42.331
I know what you mean.

11:42.392 --> 11:44.350
Although I wouldn't really say
Jasmine has beady eyes.

11:44.430 --> 11:46.350
Jasmine? Who's talking about Jasmine?

11:46.430 --> 11:49.310
I am! 'Cause every time I say her name
a few times, she just appears.

11:49.390 --> 11:50.810
It's like, "Jasmine, Jasmine, Jasmine!"

11:50.890 --> 11:52.940
Boo!

11:53.520 --> 11:55.610
I found you!

11:56.150 --> 11:57.200
You did.

11:57.530 --> 11:59.740
What's wrong?
You look pale.Â Are you okay?

11:59.820 --> 12:01.610
No! I'm not okay!

12:05.450 --> 12:07.660
Good vibes, good vibes, good vibes.

12:07.750 --> 12:09.080
Hey, we'll catch you guys.

12:10.830 --> 12:12.460
I'm not okay because I need something.

12:13.130 --> 12:15.750
Uh, flaming hot Cheetos with chili,

12:15.840 --> 12:18.130
chamoy, and extra lime
from Raul's pink truck.

12:18.210 --> 12:19.546
Well, that's too bad, 'cause Raul is...

12:19.583 --> 12:20.663
Awesome!

12:21.800 --> 12:23.300
Hey, you know what?

12:23.550 --> 12:25.390
Ask, Papi, and you shall receive.

12:25.680 --> 12:27.890
Thank you. That would be amazing.

12:32.640 --> 12:34.980
You know, that would be amazing.

12:35.060 --> 12:36.940
Because Raul is retired.

12:37.070 --> 12:38.120
Exactly.

12:38.320 --> 12:41.900
Which means, maybe I won't be seeing
some of her for quite some time.

12:43.280 --> 12:44.330
I mean...

12:44.620 --> 12:45.690
I'm gonna miss her and think

12:45.727 --> 12:47.656
nice thoughts about
her while she's gone.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.970
Laura, I'm so sorry I'm late.

13:10.560 --> 13:13.240
No worries. But I can't
stay as long as I'd hoped.

13:13.277 --> 13:14.443
The bus takes two hours.

13:14.480 --> 13:15.850
Two hours? No, no, no.

13:15.940 --> 13:17.650
I'll get you a lift. I insist.

13:18.360 --> 13:20.530
- You want something to drink?
- I'm good.

13:20.610 --> 13:21.660
Okay.

13:22.570 --> 13:23.700
Let's get to it.

13:24.660 --> 13:27.200
No, I'm not cool with this.
Why can't the money stay with you?

13:27.280 --> 13:28.330
Because it's your turn.

13:29.660 --> 13:30.990
I'm just the bagman.

13:31.080 --> 13:32.910
- Where's Monse?
- She's not coming.

13:33.080 --> 13:36.170
If she's not here to vote, how are
we supposed to make any decisions?

13:36.250 --> 13:37.790
I designate Ruby as my proxy.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.460
I'll allow it.

13:40.170 --> 13:42.710
Okay. So let's get started.
Anybody got any ideas?

13:42.800 --> 13:45.840
Right here. I think we draw up
a fake business plan

13:45.930 --> 13:47.430
for an Owl Cafe.

13:47.510 --> 13:49.390
Owl Pacino's Cappuccinos.

13:49.680 --> 13:51.560
Get investors to front us
the startup money,

13:51.640 --> 13:52.810
then using that money,

13:52.890 --> 13:54.730
make our business look
even more legitimate

13:54.793 --> 13:56.684
and attract even more investors...

13:56.738 --> 13:58.551
Jamal, it's a bad idea.

13:59.310 --> 14:00.940
How do I debate with her
if she's not even here?

14:01.020 --> 14:03.490
There's no debate. It's a bad idea.

14:03.940 --> 14:05.150
And a Ponzi scheme.

14:05.240 --> 14:06.290
We know.

14:06.360 --> 14:08.280
Actually, it sounds like you don't.

14:08.910 --> 14:11.290
What you need is a cash business

14:11.370 --> 14:14.120
so you can take your old bills,
which you can't use,

14:14.580 --> 14:17.000
and turn them into new bills,
which you can.

14:19.250 --> 14:21.460
Well, everyone in favor of using
Abuelita's cash business

14:21.550 --> 14:23.840
to turn our old bills
into new bills say "Aye."

14:24.590 --> 14:26.590
No. No.

14:27.430 --> 14:28.480
I mean...

14:29.600 --> 14:32.180
Yes, it could work.

14:33.470 --> 14:34.520
Maybe.

14:35.430 --> 14:37.230
But it's going to take some time.

14:38.020 --> 14:39.070
And...

14:40.060 --> 14:43.360
I get a little something on top
of my 20% share of the money, right?

14:43.440 --> 14:45.900
What? How can you even make this
about money? We're family!

14:45.990 --> 14:47.780
And you should never do business
with family,

14:47.860 --> 14:50.700
which is why I shouldn't even
be thinking about helping you.

14:50.780 --> 14:52.530
Well, 20% is out of the question.

14:52.660 --> 14:54.870
We're already splitting the money
four ways.

14:55.370 --> 14:56.420
Four ways?

14:56.870 --> 14:58.210
Insult upon insult.

14:59.250 --> 15:01.540
You want to cut me out. And you!

15:01.630 --> 15:03.590
These pendejos didn't
even believe in you.

15:03.670 --> 15:04.840
They called you pathetic.

15:05.840 --> 15:07.720
- I never said that.
- But he thought it.

15:07.924 --> 15:08.974
And that's worse.

15:09.010 --> 15:10.680
Get that.

15:12.800 --> 15:14.850
I... Don't look at me.
I didn't say anything.

15:15.520 --> 15:16.810
- Hey!
- What?

15:16.890 --> 15:21.150
Flamin' Hot Cheetos with chili,
extra lime from Raul's truck.

15:21.231 --> 15:22.356
Raul's retired.

15:22.393 --> 15:24.184
I know, it took three
hours, round-trip!

15:24.320 --> 15:25.780
Well, it's not long enough!

15:26.940 --> 15:29.280
You just don't get it, do you?
Well, see if you get this.

15:34.240 --> 15:35.410
You forgot the chamoy.

15:36.040 --> 15:39.080
I... I didn't want it to get soggy.

15:45.960 --> 15:47.010
What?

15:47.083 --> 15:48.630
Okay, you know all
that work you're doing

15:48.667 --> 15:50.289
to get right with the universe?

15:50.326 --> 15:52.015
- Well, that just ended.
- No.

15:52.180 --> 15:55.140
That was just one misstep.
That's not how karma works.

15:55.220 --> 15:58.100
Actually, I think that's exactly
how karma works.

15:58.934 --> 15:59.984
No!

16:00.020 --> 16:02.270
One good deed undoes one bad one.
One for one.

16:02.350 --> 16:03.520
No, no, no.

16:03.730 --> 16:07.400
If that were true, you could literally
go out and murder a baby seal,

16:07.480 --> 16:10.150
and then as long as you recycled
your compost, you'd be good.

16:10.606 --> 16:12.208
Judging from what I
just saw,Â you're like

16:12.245 --> 16:13.906
three dead baby seals in the red.

16:13.950 --> 16:16.870
- More like five.
- You gotta apologize.

16:17.740 --> 16:18.950
Listen to the bagman.

16:22.420 --> 16:24.537
So, I was in band for, like, two hours.

16:24.574 --> 16:25.996
I have no musical inclination.

16:26.040 --> 16:29.760
Me too. My mom forced me
to play clarinet for years. Hated it!

16:30.220 --> 16:32.010
But band was way better
than Pop Warner cheer.

16:32.470 --> 16:35.220
Oh, God. Cheer! What's the point?

16:37.180 --> 16:39.770
You have any specific questions for me?
I feel like I'm rambling.

16:39.850 --> 16:41.694
Not at all. You're helping a ton.

16:41.731 --> 16:43.702
But you're not writing anything down.

16:44.600 --> 16:48.570
True. I'm just so enjoying hearing
everything about your life.

16:50.030 --> 16:52.240
Freeridge sounds
like it hasn't changed much.

16:53.990 --> 16:55.410
I thought you didn't know Freeridge.

16:56.870 --> 16:59.120
I mean, from how I imagined it to be.

16:59.660 --> 17:01.410
My story is set in a similar world.

17:02.080 --> 17:04.670
Are you sure you wanna set it
in a place like Freeridge?

17:04.750 --> 17:06.380
It's not exactly a beach read.

17:07.339 --> 17:08.390
I mean...

17:08.460 --> 17:11.589
the only girlfriend I've ever had was
gunned down at her own quince.

17:11.670 --> 17:13.300
And my boyfriend is homeless.

17:13.380 --> 17:15.680
Oh, Laura. I'm so sorry.

17:16.430 --> 17:17.480
Me too.

17:18.599 --> 17:20.140
How are you coping with that?

17:22.140 --> 17:25.440
I guess somewhere along the way
I got a little numb to loss.

17:26.020 --> 17:27.150
My mom left me when I was three.

17:32.030 --> 17:33.490
My dad. Mind if I take this?

17:34.490 --> 17:36.280
Take it. I'm gonna use the ladies' room.

17:37.950 --> 17:39.030
Hey, Dad.

17:39.450 --> 17:42.238
Dinner? I don't know. Whatever you want.

17:43.089 --> 17:44.769
âª Short and sweet âª

17:45.040 --> 17:47.540
âª Just the kind of girl you wanna meet âª

17:47.630 --> 17:50.710
âª Always happy, never sad âª
âª I love to hang with Dad! âª

17:50.800 --> 17:52.090
âª Short and sweet âª

17:52.550 --> 17:54.760
âª You're the hero that I wanna meet âª

17:58.140 --> 17:59.190
What up, Peeper?

18:00.220 --> 18:01.560
You weren't answering your door.

18:01.930 --> 18:04.020
Because I'm in the middle of a show.

18:07.310 --> 18:08.610
Mr. Flores, hi.

18:08.860 --> 18:10.730
I'm your neighbor Ruby Martinez.

18:13.320 --> 18:14.780
Is he mad at me?

18:15.570 --> 18:17.490
Or... high?

18:17.780 --> 18:19.200
Why are you whispering?

18:19.280 --> 18:22.040
- Because he's right there.
- Not really.

18:23.080 --> 18:24.750
Hey, Papi, you're looking a little red.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.050
Get his arms.

18:30.340 --> 18:32.380
What? You just gonna stand there
and watch a man burn?

18:36.340 --> 18:37.630
What? Something happen to him?

18:37.880 --> 18:38.930
Afghanistan.

18:39.220 --> 18:40.720
Hey, get the tops of his feet.

18:41.430 --> 18:44.560
Last timeÂ I forgot,
he didn't talk to me for a week.

18:48.020 --> 18:49.230
Oh.

18:51.480 --> 18:53.860
Listen, I came over here to apologize.

18:54.320 --> 18:56.700
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have blown up
at you like that.

18:56.780 --> 18:58.110
Oh, boo, it's fine.

18:58.320 --> 18:59.990
I know I can be a little much.

19:00.450 --> 19:02.370
Some people even find me annoying.

19:03.950 --> 19:05.200
Okay, most people.

19:05.830 --> 19:07.630
But when you've had enough
doors slammed in your face,

19:07.666 --> 19:09.146
you kinda get used to it.

19:09.271 --> 19:11.483
I mean, some people may not like me,

19:11.520 --> 19:13.626
but that just means
I got to love myself

19:13.920 --> 19:14.970
that much more.

19:16.210 --> 19:17.670
I can be a little much too.

19:17.760 --> 19:18.810
Oh, I know.

19:19.130 --> 19:22.220
But who cares? You gotta be you.
Why live for other people?

19:23.930 --> 19:25.180
Why are you letting me off so easy?

19:25.390 --> 19:27.390
'Cause I know you got
a lot on your plate.

19:27.930 --> 19:29.980
I mean, shit, Ruby, you just got shot.

19:31.350 --> 19:32.480
Olivia's dead.

19:34.480 --> 19:36.820
- That's all I think about.
- Yo, I get it.

19:37.610 --> 19:40.910
When my dad first came home,
all I did was bargain with the universe

19:40.990 --> 19:42.620
for things to go back
to the way they were.

19:43.200 --> 19:44.830
But they never did, so...

19:45.450 --> 19:47.080
I realized if I wanted things to change,

19:47.450 --> 19:50.330
I'd have to focus on the things
that I can actually control.

19:50.420 --> 19:53.790
And the only thing
I could actually control... was me.

19:54.500 --> 19:56.670
So I decided to be happy.
'Cause why screw yourself

19:56.760 --> 19:58.800
if the universe is just gonna screw
you anyway?

20:01.760 --> 20:02.840
Right, Papi?

20:07.310 --> 20:09.270
- Abuelita!
- Get out!

20:09.350 --> 20:10.730
Abuelita!

20:11.520 --> 20:12.570
Listen to me.

20:13.150 --> 20:14.200
I'm begging you.

20:14.400 --> 20:16.320
We can't do this without you.
We need you!

20:16.610 --> 20:19.360
- Like tacos need Tuesday.
- Like Batman needs Robin.

20:19.440 --> 20:21.990
Does Batman really need Robin?

20:24.620 --> 20:27.370
All I'm hearing is how much you need me.

20:27.870 --> 20:29.870
The real question is why do I need you?

20:29.960 --> 20:31.670
You want 20%, you got it.

20:31.758 --> 20:33.623
That offer expired.

20:33.764 --> 20:35.420
- You need to go.
- Wait!

20:35.500 --> 20:37.250
Jamal's told me many of your stories.

20:37.340 --> 20:39.460
You really lived it up back in the day,
didn't you?

20:39.550 --> 20:41.220
Is he going somewhere with this?

20:41.630 --> 20:45.550
My point is, when was the last time
you felt like you really lived?

20:45.640 --> 20:48.470
Felt that rush of adrenaline
from doing something you knew

20:48.560 --> 20:50.390
you weren't supposed to do?

20:50.810 --> 20:52.270
This isn't just easy money.

20:52.350 --> 20:56.230
This is an opportunity for adventure.
Excitement.

20:57.940 --> 21:00.570
I don't need to break the law
to blow my boobs back.

21:00.650 --> 21:02.490
I could go skydiving
or get a motorcycle.

21:02.570 --> 21:03.620
With what money?

21:04.030 --> 21:05.080
Think about it!

21:05.280 --> 21:06.660
Don't you want to travel?

21:06.740 --> 21:11.330
Picture yourself
at an all-inclusive resort like Sandals.

21:11.410 --> 21:14.152
You're right on a beach,
you've got a drink in your hand.

21:14.189 --> 21:15.426
- Okay!
- And you just dipped

21:15.463 --> 21:17.383
your toe in the pool.

21:17.420 --> 21:19.380
Pool? I thought I was on a beach.

21:19.880 --> 21:20.930
Ahem!

21:21.210 --> 21:23.630
With 25%, you could have both.

21:24.380 --> 21:26.220
Well, I like the sound of that.

21:27.550 --> 21:28.810
- I'm...
- 35%!

21:28.890 --> 21:31.390
Please, Abuelita! Pretty please!

21:31.850 --> 21:32.900
I'm in!

21:34.890 --> 21:35.940
Shake on it.

21:48.160 --> 21:49.210
Jasmine?

21:50.200 --> 21:51.250
I, uh...

21:53.290 --> 21:54.460
I got to apologize.

21:55.040 --> 21:57.080
- I thought you already did.
- Yeah, but...

21:58.340 --> 22:00.920
I wasn't saying sorry
'cause I was sorry.

22:01.300 --> 22:03.300
I was saying sorry
'cause I felt obligated.

22:03.670 --> 22:04.760
Obligated to who?

22:06.010 --> 22:07.060
The universe.

22:07.550 --> 22:09.550
I know it doesn't make any sense, but...

22:10.510 --> 22:11.640
I felt like...

22:12.560 --> 22:14.060
if I was nice to you, then...

22:14.730 --> 22:17.980
maybe the universe would stop making me
feel so sad about Olivia.

22:20.150 --> 22:22.400
What if I told you
that you were the universe?

22:27.990 --> 22:30.530
I know you said I have more control
than I think...

22:32.490 --> 22:34.080
but it doesn't feel that way.

22:36.870 --> 22:39.380
I just wanna go back
to before all this happened.

22:41.130 --> 22:43.380
I keep replaying everything in my head.

22:45.050 --> 22:46.930
She wanted to cancel the quince.

22:48.890 --> 22:50.800
What if I hadn't forced her to have it?

22:50.890 --> 22:51.940
You did nothing wrong.

22:52.010 --> 22:54.890
What if I hadn't pulled her
on the dance floor?

22:54.970 --> 22:57.730
Or what if I hadn't swung her around
when I saw Latrelle?

22:58.690 --> 23:02.320
Maybe the bullet would have only gone
through her and just killed me.

23:02.400 --> 23:03.780
You did nothing wrong!

23:04.320 --> 23:07.820
I should've dropped to the floor,
or ducked down!

23:07.900 --> 23:09.490
But you did nothing wrong!

23:10.490 --> 23:12.200
You're just saying that. But...

23:12.280 --> 23:13.830
Stop punishing yourself.

23:13.910 --> 23:17.080
There is nothing that you could have
or you should have done.

23:17.580 --> 23:18.630
Nothing.

23:19.370 --> 23:20.420
And you know why?

23:20.710 --> 23:22.590
Aye, Ruby, 'cause for all the reasons

23:22.670 --> 23:25.130
that you're trying to make right
with the universe...

23:25.840 --> 23:28.050
the universe is just
gonna be what it is.

23:29.010 --> 23:31.090
It's fate, baby.

23:31.680 --> 23:33.810
And you can't do
anything to change that.

23:35.930 --> 23:38.640
Bad things happen to good people
all the time.

23:40.230 --> 23:41.280
For no reason.

23:49.610 --> 23:50.660
Thank you.

23:53.280 --> 23:55.080
We're gonna be really good friends.

23:57.830 --> 23:58.880
We already are.

24:00.420 --> 24:04.880
You blew me away back there.
I shouldn't have underestimated you.

24:05.380 --> 24:07.420
It's the muscles. Throws people off.

24:08.260 --> 24:09.713
Hey, we make a pretty good team.

24:09.750 --> 24:11.627
Yeah. We do, don't we?

24:17.310 --> 24:18.810
Hey, do you believe in karma?

24:20.350 --> 24:22.730
Like... do you think I'm paying
for what I did?

24:23.400 --> 24:25.270
- But you didn't do anything.
- But that's the thing.

24:26.110 --> 24:27.160
Maybe I should've.

24:28.400 --> 24:29.610
Dude, are you crazy?

24:29.860 --> 24:32.610
You think you have bad karma
because you didn't kill someone?

24:33.450 --> 24:35.280
Dude, you didn't kill someone!

24:35.740 --> 24:38.160
You're not in a gang anymore.
You can sleep at night.

24:38.240 --> 24:39.290
Actually, I can't.

24:39.910 --> 24:42.920
I haven't in a long time,
since... I've had no home.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.540
Well, why don't you stay with me?

24:49.260 --> 24:50.310
You never asked.

24:50.800 --> 24:51.850
Well, I'm asking.

24:52.090 --> 24:54.970
In fact, I could really use the backup,
'cause I got some heat on me.

24:55.050 --> 24:57.459
- Heat from who?
- You mean from what?

24:58.600 --> 24:59.650
You're weird.

24:59.686 --> 25:01.276
And you're pretty.

25:02.980 --> 25:04.190
- How'd it go?
- Uh...

25:05.270 --> 25:06.770
Jasmine's eating lunch
with us every day.

25:07.440 --> 25:09.610
Wow. She really worked you.

25:10.320 --> 25:12.860
No. I like Jasmine.

25:18.830 --> 25:22.000
If your dad is on the road
most of the time, who stays with you?

25:22.410 --> 25:25.460
I had a babysitter, but now I'm
old enough to stay by myself.

25:26.040 --> 25:27.670
That's a lot of responsibility.

25:28.670 --> 25:32.010
I know you said your mom
wasn't in the picture,

25:32.090 --> 25:35.930
but... do you have a stepmom,
or does your father have a girlfriend?

25:36.720 --> 25:38.600
Nope, no lady friends.

25:39.060 --> 25:40.220
Is that hard for you?

25:40.640 --> 25:41.690
In what way?

25:42.640 --> 25:44.020
To be without a mother?

25:45.600 --> 25:47.730
Does your dad ever talk to you
about yours?

25:49.690 --> 25:51.780
You don't have to answer that.

25:51.860 --> 25:53.700
It's a tough subject, I can imagine.

25:56.200 --> 25:57.250
I don't mind.

25:58.530 --> 26:00.450
We don't really talk a lot about my mom.

26:00.540 --> 26:03.330
Not because of me, but because I think
it's too tough on my dad.

26:04.460 --> 26:07.170
I didn't really know her when she left,
so losing her,

26:07.460 --> 26:10.300
in a strange way, wasn't as hard on me
as it was on him.

26:11.130 --> 26:12.300
Is that weird?

26:12.630 --> 26:14.170
So you're not mad at your mom?

26:14.470 --> 26:15.520
Nope.

26:16.800 --> 26:19.850
I realized at an early age
that we all have choices about things.

26:20.180 --> 26:22.310
I could be mad at my mom
or choose to believe

26:22.390 --> 26:24.310
that there's a good reason why she left.

26:24.680 --> 26:26.350
A reason that had nothing to do with me

26:26.440 --> 26:28.940
and that choice feels
like the right one to make.

26:31.650 --> 26:33.820
Selena leaving had nothing to do
with her daughter.

26:34.690 --> 26:35.740
Selena?

26:36.150 --> 26:38.870
Is that your character's name?
That's my mom's name.

26:38.950 --> 26:41.080
My dad's name is Monty
and my mom's name is Selena.

26:41.160 --> 26:43.370
- That's why...
- That's why we named you Monse.
