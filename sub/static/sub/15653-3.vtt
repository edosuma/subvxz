(approaching footsteps)

00:18.211 --> 00:19.746
(zipper opens)

00:40.234 --> 00:41.334
(laughs)

00:41.368 --> 00:43.206
A bandana? Really?

00:43.737 --> 00:45.773
What, are you on your way to Coachella?

00:48.742 --> 00:49.877
(growling)

00:49.910 --> 00:52.180
(groaning)

01:02.588 --> 01:03.590
(girl screams)

01:03.623 --> 01:05.459
(dull thud)

01:34.954 --> 01:40.328
(music playing on radio)

01:57.330 --> 02:00.067
(man talking on radio)

02:07.237 --> 02:08.871
(phone beeps, rings)

MARGARET: <i>You've reached
Margaret and Billy.</i>

02:10.273 --> 02:11.875
<i>Please leave a message after the beep,</i>

02:11.906 --> 02:13.441
<i>and we'll call you back in a jiffy.</i>

02:13.475 --> 02:16.045
Hey, it's me. Sorry to call so early.

02:16.077 --> 02:17.818
Figured you'd be up with the baby.

02:18.821 --> 02:20.916
- I thought I'd call you before...
- (chain rattles)

02:35.463 --> 02:39.467
I'm sorry I haven't been callin'.
Workin' a lot of overtime.

02:39.500 --> 02:40.896
I'm just gonna say it,

02:42.104 --> 02:43.304
I wanna see Billy.

02:45.540 --> 02:48.611
I'm her father and it
ain't right that I can't.

02:53.614 --> 02:56.485
And I don't care what your lawyer
got that judge to say.

02:58.452 --> 03:00.255
You're letting these assholes
talk you into shit

03:00.289 --> 03:01.726
that you would never do...

03:03.992 --> 03:06.133
that we would never do to each other.

03:14.201 --> 03:17.869
I wanna see her. And I wanna see you.

03:19.641 --> 03:21.028
Call me.

03:25.681 --> 03:27.249
Hands! Now!

03:29.684 --> 03:31.152
What the fuck?

03:31.185 --> 03:32.688
No, no, no.

03:32.720 --> 03:34.137
No, it's OK.

03:34.556 --> 03:36.730
Just tell me what happened.
Who did this to you?

03:37.092 --> 03:40.495
(speaking in Spanish) _

03:40.529 --> 03:42.198
You're a <i>culebra?</i>

03:43.188 --> 03:45.834
_

03:46.301 --> 03:49.238
Who did? Where did he take you?

03:49.792 --> 03:51.359
_

03:51.439 --> 03:53.275
Us? Who's...

03:54.343 --> 03:55.278
Who's us?

03:55.357 --> 03:56.983
_

03:58.112 --> 03:59.612
<i>Agua Fría...</i>

04:00.082 --> 04:02.418
- <i>Agua.</i>
- <i>Agua Fría...</i>

04:02.451 --> 04:04.153
You stay here.

04:18.766 --> 04:22.070
Hey, hey. Put that down.

04:22.525 --> 04:23.924
_

04:24.271 --> 04:25.440
No!

04:26.742 --> 04:28.076
Shit!

04:31.545 --> 04:33.548
(speaking in Spanish) _

04:47.562 --> 04:50.276
TANNER: Their deaths
were only the beginning...

04:51.533 --> 04:54.772
The ultimate offering to the gods.

04:55.804 --> 05:00.009
Who knows what secrets
these rituals will reveal...

05:01.076 --> 05:02.519
where they will take us?

05:03.244 --> 05:06.348
If not for archaeologists
such as myself,

05:06.381 --> 05:09.785
many of these secrets
might be lost forever.

05:09.817 --> 05:12.086
And with every expedition,

05:12.119 --> 05:17.091
we must be willing to dig, and dig deep.

05:17.124 --> 05:22.764
To plumb the depths of every dark
hole and foreboding crevasse

05:23.312 --> 05:27.303
to find what we seek.

05:27.335 --> 05:29.037
And until we do that,

05:29.071 --> 05:30.672
we may never be able to tap into

05:30.704 --> 05:35.002
the energy of the universe
like the ancients did.

05:38.513 --> 05:40.616
Well... (clears throat)

05:40.648 --> 05:43.752
It looks like that
just about does it for today.

05:50.624 --> 05:53.461
Don't forget to read
and review Chapter 33.

05:53.494 --> 05:54.797
I want those essays.

05:54.829 --> 05:59.034
And I don't mean <i>ese,</i> I want essays.

06:02.336 --> 06:03.771
That was so wild.

06:03.804 --> 06:06.307
Ah, you were very brave today, Mary-Jo.

06:06.340 --> 06:07.525
Oh, I don't know.

06:08.110 --> 06:09.744
It was all pretend, right?

06:09.778 --> 06:12.641
I don't know, you may be
ready for the real deal.

06:12.674 --> 06:16.618
I don't normally do this,
but if you're interested,

06:16.650 --> 06:19.254
I may have an opening on my team.

06:19.287 --> 06:20.789
You really think I'm ready for that?

06:21.325 --> 06:22.658
Well...

06:24.998 --> 06:27.168
only the gods can decide.

06:54.456 --> 06:56.592
Why does this Kate person even matter?

06:56.624 --> 06:59.160
She's not Kate anymore. She's possessed.

06:59.194 --> 07:01.263
She thinks she's some type of queen.

07:04.766 --> 07:05.833
Does that ring a bell?

07:05.867 --> 07:07.468
There were stories.

07:07.501 --> 07:10.571
Legends. A queen of Xibalba
who came to this realm.

07:10.605 --> 07:12.407
And when were you gonna tell us that?

07:12.439 --> 07:14.461
- It's just a legend.
- OK, you know what, where is your boss?

07:14.486 --> 07:16.644
Clearly, you don't have the information
we need, maybe she does.

07:16.677 --> 07:18.880
Lord Venganza is in hiding.
She's a target.

07:18.913 --> 07:21.649
Oh, she's a target. Subtly ironic.

07:21.682 --> 07:23.684
We got hell's prisoners
coming at us day and night,

07:23.718 --> 07:26.622
but your boss,
your boss is the target. OK.

07:26.655 --> 07:28.724
I thought you were going
to recruit Santanico Pandemonium.

07:28.756 --> 07:29.891
She bailed on us.

07:29.925 --> 07:31.425
Then get the Peacekeeper.

07:31.458 --> 07:33.595
- You should be working together.
- Oh, my God.

07:33.627 --> 07:35.530
He's about as close to a fighting
force as you're going to get.

07:35.564 --> 07:36.765
Yeah.

07:36.797 --> 07:38.300
That's not entirely accurate.

07:38.333 --> 07:40.436
Oh God, here we go...

07:42.737 --> 07:45.641
- I found a passage in the Ancient Word.
- Wow.

07:45.674 --> 07:47.943
It says the Lords once utilized
the skills of a demon hunter

07:47.975 --> 07:49.778
by the name of Ilhicamina.

07:49.811 --> 07:51.480
"The one who shoots arrows at the sky."

07:51.513 --> 07:52.954
That sounds like a lousy shot.

07:53.949 --> 07:55.951
This guy tracked, captured,

07:55.984 --> 07:58.487
and tossed most of the Xibalbans
in the Labyrinth

07:58.520 --> 08:00.389
by using their own weapons against them.

08:00.422 --> 08:03.592
You want a fighting force?
This is a one-man fighting force.

08:03.624 --> 08:05.727
Ilhicamina is dead.

08:08.396 --> 08:10.499
I told you. What did I say?

08:10.532 --> 08:14.836
No, it... it says that he retired,
that the Lords gave him

08:14.869 --> 08:17.439
"untouched land
in a fertile river basin."

08:17.472 --> 08:19.341
I mean, it doesn't say where,
but I think I found

08:19.374 --> 08:20.576
the coordinates hidden in the text.

08:20.609 --> 08:22.544
So, he got his 40 acres and a mule,

08:22.576 --> 08:23.911
went on his merry way.

08:23.944 --> 08:25.547
Sounds smart. Pay up.

08:27.014 --> 08:28.884
It doesn't say that he died.

08:28.917 --> 08:32.621
If he were alive, don't you think
we would have sent for him?

08:32.654 --> 08:34.188
He's gone.

08:36.424 --> 08:39.227
Whoa!

08:39.260 --> 08:40.645
She's hiding something.

08:40.671 --> 08:42.296
Which is why we have to go
and look for this guy.

08:42.328 --> 08:45.600
We don't have time to go chasing
after your footnotes, Richard.

08:45.633 --> 08:48.669
We gotta find the next...
thing before it attacks.

08:48.703 --> 08:50.639
Not if it finds us first.

08:56.044 --> 08:58.981
(club dance music playing)

09:07.756 --> 09:09.690
(water splashing)

09:09.723 --> 09:11.826
(frolic and laughter)

09:26.741 --> 09:27.910
(growling)

09:29.310 --> 09:30.511
(snarling)

09:35.949 --> 09:42.023
<i>♪ Oh baby I get high ♪</i>

09:43.091 --> 09:44.960
TANNER: Well...

09:44.992 --> 09:49.330
now that we've gotten a little more
comfortable with each other,

09:52.833 --> 09:55.938
I'd say it's time
we talk about next steps.

09:58.872 --> 10:00.975
(people chattering)

10:15.243 --> 10:16.579
(bell clangs)

10:17.858 --> 10:19.594
(horror movie playing on TV)

10:35.109 --> 10:38.446
Bro! I know you.

10:38.479 --> 10:41.082
You're that Peacekeeper dude.
Tanner warned us about you.

10:41.116 --> 10:42.351
As he should.

10:42.383 --> 10:43.684
(groans)

10:43.718 --> 10:45.953
(panting)

10:45.987 --> 10:49.725
I need office hours with the professor.
Tell me where he's at.

10:49.757 --> 10:50.992
Bro.

10:52.059 --> 10:53.429
(panting)

10:56.030 --> 10:57.900
(groaning)

11:02.936 --> 11:04.972
So like we talked about in school,

11:06.674 --> 11:09.836
all those places are real.

11:10.578 --> 11:13.582
There is an Underworld.

11:14.815 --> 11:17.894
There are creatures beneath.

11:17.927 --> 11:21.589
So, if you're ready to join the team,

11:21.622 --> 11:25.861
I need to know that you're committed
before we do anything else.

11:26.928 --> 11:28.497
I am, Professor.

11:29.120 --> 11:30.620
I'm ready to see the other side.

11:31.498 --> 11:35.636
Well, strap in, buckle up.

11:35.670 --> 11:37.973
We're goin' for a ride.

11:39.040 --> 11:40.541
(snarls)

11:42.609 --> 11:44.779
(deep rumbling growl)

11:52.953 --> 11:54.856
Who the hell let you in here?

11:54.889 --> 11:56.091
Back to your old tricks, huh, Professor?

11:56.123 --> 11:57.825
I didn't even fill her up yet!

11:57.858 --> 11:59.026
(grunts)

11:59.059 --> 12:00.027
(groans)

12:00.060 --> 12:02.163
Hey, now, Ranger.

12:02.197 --> 12:05.100
Treat me like that and we're gonna
have to establish a safe word.

12:06.900 --> 12:09.838
Thanks a lot, asshole! Now
I'll never be on the team!

12:10.972 --> 12:12.774
Nice goin', Gonzalez.

12:12.806 --> 12:16.110
That little Betty there had
a good future ahead of her...

12:16.144 --> 12:17.713
And you just ruined it.

12:18.947 --> 12:20.015
You slippery bastard.

12:20.048 --> 12:22.083
(both grunting)

12:28.622 --> 12:30.525
(snarls)

12:37.732 --> 12:38.934
(bottle shatters)

12:47.541 --> 12:50.110
- I finally... get...
- (groans)

12:50.144 --> 12:52.681
- to make you... pay!
- (groans)

12:54.748 --> 12:57.117
(panting) You might want
to watch your step, Ranger.

12:57.150 --> 13:00.555
(snarling)

13:01.847 --> 13:04.250
(drops falling)

13:08.688 --> 13:10.356
(groaning)

13:11.723 --> 13:14.293
(gasping, panting)

13:15.428 --> 13:20.232
(screaming)

13:20.463 --> 13:22.410
RICHIE: This should be
Ilhicamina's spot.

13:22.443 --> 13:25.763
Right where the Pace
and Lago Vista Rivers meet.

13:25.788 --> 13:28.525
Well, it looks like the rivers
stopped meeting here a while ago.

13:28.559 --> 13:31.663
Guess your magic Mexican
story needs an update.

13:32.896 --> 13:34.565
Maybe they got it.

13:34.598 --> 13:37.468
Gas and toke? I doubt it.

13:37.501 --> 13:39.637
Might as well resupply.

13:39.670 --> 13:41.372
(dog barking)

13:43.340 --> 13:44.642
(bell rings)

13:46.576 --> 13:47.878
(rock and roll playing)

14:10.700 --> 14:13.937
Hey man, are you here
to peruse my merch,

14:13.970 --> 14:15.772
or feel up my art?

14:15.806 --> 14:17.742
Maybe a little of both?

14:17.775 --> 14:20.845
Right on, right on, Mr., uh...

14:22.720 --> 14:26.191
Eduardo Sánchez, eh?

14:26.224 --> 14:29.360
(chuckles) Yeah. Well, my name is Burt,

14:29.393 --> 14:32.764
and I will be your... dispenser today.

14:32.797 --> 14:34.365
What tickles your fancy?

14:34.398 --> 14:36.401
We got Tequila Sunrise...

14:36.435 --> 14:39.428
Nope! Dandelion Paw. (laughs)

14:39.460 --> 14:42.407
Actually, I'm looking
for a very particular strain.

14:43.714 --> 14:45.416
Do you have, uh...

14:47.646 --> 14:48.981
(whispers) Ilhicamina?

14:49.013 --> 14:52.584
I might've caught that once in the '70s.

14:52.617 --> 14:54.252
In those days, we didn't think twice

14:54.286 --> 14:56.454
about goin' bareback,
you know? (chuckles)

14:56.488 --> 14:58.149
Actually, it's been
around for centuries.

14:58.182 --> 15:01.926
OK, just buy an eighth and let's get
outta here, Richard. Come on.

15:01.959 --> 15:04.729
I'm sorry I don't stock
your ganja, but, um...

15:05.896 --> 15:08.127
Free samples. In the back.

15:08.160 --> 15:10.575
Hmm... We love free samples.

15:10.607 --> 15:11.937
We do?

15:14.445 --> 15:15.947
Yeah.

15:21.579 --> 15:24.749
So where did you hear
about this El Camino, anyway?

15:24.782 --> 15:28.420
Ilhicamina. Like I said, goes way back.

15:29.554 --> 15:31.323
Too bad you don't have the hook-up.

15:34.325 --> 15:38.263
STORE OWNER: Even if I did, I bet
you people wouldn't appreciate it.

15:40.799 --> 15:44.569
The true greats are never really
appreciated, but, you're wrong.

15:44.603 --> 15:47.739
Now is when people need them the most.

15:47.772 --> 15:49.707
Look... (sighs)

15:49.741 --> 15:54.313
Now that is some nice jewelry
you got there, Burt.

15:54.345 --> 15:56.281
RICHIE: Sure as shit don't look
like no chicken foot though.

15:56.315 --> 16:01.286
SETH: No, more like a, uh,
trophy a hunter might wear.

16:01.319 --> 16:03.756
(breather heavily)
The hand of a <i>chaneque.</i>

16:03.789 --> 16:09.528
Little toddler-sized bastards
with wrinkly-ass old-man faces.

16:09.560 --> 16:11.329
Freaky-deaky.

16:11.363 --> 16:13.732
And hard as fuck to kill.

16:13.765 --> 16:16.702
Time for you to take your old job back.

16:18.469 --> 16:20.372
What kinda sick shit are you
doing to these kids?

16:20.405 --> 16:22.574
I'm a transformed man, OK, Ranger?

16:22.607 --> 16:26.720
No, you're just a snake.
Same slime. New venom.

16:26.745 --> 16:30.848
Hey, I don't take lives anymore,
all right? I transform them.

16:30.882 --> 16:32.751
Tell that to your late-night snack.

16:32.784 --> 16:35.920
Well, that's just part of the food chain.
Can't help that.

16:35.954 --> 16:37.923
Now tell me what the hell
happened to my student.

16:37.955 --> 16:40.526
He showed up at my apartment,
missing half his neck.

16:40.559 --> 16:41.827
Begging for help.

16:41.859 --> 16:44.596
When was the last time
anybody here saw Hector?

16:45.102 --> 16:47.004
Had to be over a week ago.

16:47.397 --> 16:48.901
Chloe hasn't shown up tonight, either,

16:48.934 --> 16:50.770
and she never misses a party.

16:52.738 --> 16:54.306
TANNER: Take me to him.

16:56.013 --> 16:59.017
Ah! Hector.

16:59.478 --> 17:00.612
I was gonna sneak him into a morgue

17:00.645 --> 17:01.847
in the middle of the night,

17:01.879 --> 17:03.581
do my own investigation.

17:06.298 --> 17:08.598
He staked himself
and he didn't immolate.

17:08.720 --> 17:10.789
And he's got a marking
on the back of his neck.

17:10.820 --> 17:13.125
Same as your meat-head inside.
What does it mean?

17:13.977 --> 17:15.359
He's family.

17:16.327 --> 17:18.695
Family. Nice.

17:20.631 --> 17:22.800
Here, help me out. If we find out

17:22.833 --> 17:24.736
who or what did this to Hector,

17:25.276 --> 17:27.540
maybe we could still save Chloe.

17:28.906 --> 17:31.711
(man whistling)

17:36.681 --> 17:39.617
(continues whistling)

17:45.791 --> 17:51.429
You were gonna do something awful
to me in that alley, weren't you?

17:53.063 --> 17:56.968
Sweetpea, this ain't my first rodeo.

18:01.505 --> 18:03.441
(whimpers)

18:06.095 --> 18:07.646
Hey, hey, hey.

18:07.678 --> 18:08.846
(sobbing)

18:08.879 --> 18:12.258
Hush now. No need to be afraid.

18:13.484 --> 18:16.121
We're gonna get you right
with the world again.

18:17.655 --> 18:19.224
You'll see.

18:21.792 --> 18:23.494
TANNER: These wounds
had to have been made

18:23.528 --> 18:25.317
with proper tools and precision.

18:26.130 --> 18:29.308
The incision is in
the submandibular region,

18:29.340 --> 18:32.737
superior to the digastric muscle.

18:33.732 --> 18:36.668
Oh, Sweet Jesus.

18:36.942 --> 18:38.609
What?

18:38.643 --> 18:41.046
His venom glands were removed.

18:41.079 --> 18:42.338
Why would he do that?

18:42.363 --> 18:44.348
'Cause that's the juice, man.

18:44.648 --> 18:48.754
That's how we reproduce.
That's how we regenerate.

18:48.787 --> 18:50.104
But he's still got fangs.

18:50.144 --> 18:52.558
Yeah, and a neutered dog
still has a pecker.

18:52.590 --> 18:53.858
That doesn't mean it's useful.

18:53.892 --> 18:55.661
Take away the nuts, no pups.

18:55.694 --> 18:59.522
Take away the venom glands, no <i>culebras.</i>

18:59.964 --> 19:01.766
FREDDIE: That's why he didn't immolate.

19:03.234 --> 19:04.869
Ever seen anything like this?

19:04.903 --> 19:07.506
History has. Long time ago,

19:07.539 --> 19:09.942
<i>culebras</i> were terrorized

19:09.974 --> 19:14.213
by a demonic race from... hell.

19:14.696 --> 19:16.114
From Xibalba.

19:19.135 --> 19:21.505
How do you know about Xibalba?

19:23.922 --> 19:27.759
TANNER: This was found
in an abandoned mine shaft

19:27.791 --> 19:30.028
in an unknown border town...

19:30.060 --> 19:34.666
It depicts the hierarchy of Xibalba.

19:34.698 --> 19:35.935
Starting at the top...

19:37.167 --> 19:40.738
you have the demonic royalty...

19:40.771 --> 19:44.009
And then, as we move down,
you've got the dutiful

19:44.041 --> 19:47.913
yet sadistic middle class.
And, underneath it...

19:47.945 --> 19:52.217
the very lowest of the low... our kind.

19:55.445 --> 19:56.747
Sorry, my kind.

19:59.089 --> 20:01.693
<i>Culebras</i> were nothing
but slaves in the Underworld.

20:01.725 --> 20:04.795
They were just meant to serve
the higher beings of Xibalba.

20:04.829 --> 20:08.634
And those that disobeyed were castrated.

20:08.666 --> 20:11.637
Not unlike the Nazis did
sterilizing the Jews.

20:11.669 --> 20:13.871
Or like a plantation owner would do

20:13.905 --> 20:15.541
to an uppity slave. (clicks tongue)

20:15.573 --> 20:18.709
But this guy, this
Xibalban in particular,

20:18.742 --> 20:21.879
he came from hell and took the form
of a ranch hand back in the day.

20:21.913 --> 20:25.584
<i>He's just doing his job, doing
what he thinks he has to do.</i>

20:25.617 --> 20:28.153
<i>Doing what he's done
for thousands of years.</i>

20:28.185 --> 20:32.057
<i>Enforcing. Maintaining the dominance.</i>

20:32.089 --> 20:35.264
And puttin' us back in the place
where he thinks we belong.

20:36.226 --> 20:39.997
All the way down here. At the bottom.

20:40.031 --> 20:42.935
<i>We're nothin' more than cattle
to these things.</i>

20:49.808 --> 20:53.612
Don't... kill... me.

20:53.645 --> 20:57.950
Now why would I go
and do somethin' like that?

21:09.027 --> 21:10.829
(breathing heavily)

21:12.097 --> 21:13.933
(groaning in pain)

21:18.403 --> 21:21.906
'Atta girl. Let her go.

21:27.979 --> 21:29.848
(coughing)

21:37.688 --> 21:39.358
These things are not gonna
to stop, all right?

21:39.390 --> 21:42.360
So we need you to use
your particular set of skills

21:42.394 --> 21:46.098
to help us round 'em up, send 'em back.

21:46.130 --> 21:47.832
Are you wrappin' this up?

21:47.866 --> 21:50.403
Man, that was a... that was a lot
of exposition, you know?

21:50.436 --> 21:52.404
OK, you know what? I'm done askin'.

21:52.436 --> 21:55.173
You come with us, or I put
a hole in your face.

21:55.205 --> 21:59.377
Fine, fine, fine, OK,
but can I take another hit?

22:00.008 --> 22:02.046
- Yeah.
- OK...

22:03.147 --> 22:04.382
(growls)

22:04.416 --> 22:06.385
(groans)

22:22.300 --> 22:24.136
(sighs deeply)

22:30.274 --> 22:32.644
You fuckin' amateurs.

22:33.879 --> 22:38.156
...guys out of my shop. And
never come back. <i>¿Comprende?</i>

22:38.181 --> 22:40.246
Yes, we <i>comprende,</i> we <i>comprende.</i>

22:40.693 --> 22:42.561
SETH: Hey, wait a second.

22:42.595 --> 22:46.499
Look, if you're not gonna help us,

22:46.531 --> 22:48.385
at least tell us
how to fight these things.

22:48.410 --> 22:49.757
(chuckles)

22:49.791 --> 22:54.139
That would be like, uh, Jimmy Page
telling some schmuck with a ukulele

22:54.173 --> 22:57.611
how to play "Stairway to Heaven."
It ain't gonna happen.

22:59.177 --> 23:02.448
- Ow, my fuckin' eye!
- Too slow, shithead.

23:02.482 --> 23:05.105
- (groans in pain)
- Fuck this. Come on, Richard.

23:05.137 --> 23:06.819
No wonder she told us he was dead.

23:06.852 --> 23:08.520
Who said I was dead?

23:08.553 --> 23:12.158
Venganza's number two.
Also a piece of work.

23:13.738 --> 23:16.275
Ximena. (chuckles softly)

23:16.461 --> 23:17.998
Wait, you know her?

23:20.066 --> 23:21.168
He knows her.

23:23.129 --> 23:26.666
Boys, you cannot win this war,

23:27.106 --> 23:28.974
you can't even start it, unless you know

23:29.008 --> 23:32.279
who the real monsters are.

23:32.312 --> 23:33.821
FREDDIE: So you sayin' this is one?

23:34.506 --> 23:36.850
I don't know. Yes, no, maybe.
It could be.

23:36.883 --> 23:39.293
All I know is that we gotta
get out there and find him.

23:39.326 --> 23:40.987
I mean, can't you... (sighs)

23:41.020 --> 23:44.124
put an A.P.B. out or something?
Do your job?

23:45.537 --> 23:46.436
What, you got a problem?

23:46.461 --> 23:48.160
As a matter of fact, I do.

23:48.194 --> 23:49.070
What?

23:49.102 --> 23:50.869
I don't take orders from a killer.

23:50.901 --> 23:53.165
Oh, God, really? Give me a break.

23:53.198 --> 23:54.733
Fine. Judge me all you want.

23:54.767 --> 23:56.036
I need to get to my kids.

23:57.263 --> 23:58.898
Those aren't your kids!

23:58.930 --> 24:02.300
Those are human beings you turned
into bloodsuckers in a sex den.

24:02.333 --> 24:04.370
Just because you put a stamp
on 'em doesn't make 'em yours!

24:04.402 --> 24:09.241
(grunts) They don't belong to me.
And I don't belong to them.

24:09.275 --> 24:11.477
That stamp means family!

24:11.509 --> 24:13.612
Stop. Stop!

24:15.381 --> 24:16.849
The tattoo.

24:16.882 --> 24:18.284
Yeah?

24:18.316 --> 24:20.719
If that thing saw it
on Hector and Chloe...

24:22.487 --> 24:24.590
He would know how to get
to the rest of them.

24:24.622 --> 24:26.359
I gotta get home.

24:31.296 --> 24:33.399
(door bell rings)

24:37.402 --> 24:39.738
Think you got the wrong house, Tex.

24:39.772 --> 24:43.776
I'd say I found exactly the right house.

24:54.452 --> 24:55.921
(women screaming)

24:59.958 --> 25:01.627
(metal clangs)

25:01.660 --> 25:03.496
(screaming)

25:21.580 --> 25:23.650
Wait, goddammit!

25:30.055 --> 25:31.524
Tanner!

25:38.630 --> 25:39.632
Tanner!

25:39.664 --> 25:42.367
(footsteps approaching)

25:49.141 --> 25:51.843
(snarls)

26:11.662 --> 26:12.832
Howdy.

26:31.417 --> 26:33.086
(vehicle engine starts)

26:36.020 --> 26:38.657
[ vehicle drives away)

27:10.341 --> 27:12.142
When were you gonna tell us?

27:12.176 --> 27:13.177
Tell you what?

27:13.209 --> 27:14.946
That you're full of shit.

27:17.080 --> 27:18.551
And that you're a liar.

27:18.585 --> 27:19.750
I am not a liar.

27:20.245 --> 27:21.874
You told us he was dead.

27:24.954 --> 27:26.290
Ximena.

27:28.323 --> 27:29.611
He's dead to me.

27:30.025 --> 27:31.160
Oh, baby.

27:31.194 --> 27:33.130
You gonna do me like that?

27:33.162 --> 27:34.830
(chuckles)

27:34.863 --> 27:36.832
Well, it has been two centuries.

27:36.865 --> 27:39.435
I guess that wound is still fresh.

27:39.971 --> 27:42.104
Wait, wait a second. You two are...?

27:42.138 --> 27:43.930
Oh, he didn't tell you?

27:44.506 --> 27:46.476
You'll find he forgets a lot of things.

27:46.803 --> 27:50.380
All that smoking fried his brain,
if you can even call it that.

27:50.412 --> 27:53.048
Oh, yeah? He told us that queen,

27:53.082 --> 27:54.284
you know, the one you told us

27:54.316 --> 27:56.749
was also probably a bunch of bullshit,

27:57.384 --> 27:59.890
RICHIE: she's probably the same
crazy bitch who took Kate.

27:59.922 --> 28:01.357
What was her name again?

28:02.085 --> 28:03.294
Amaru.

28:03.325 --> 28:06.062
SETH: You and your boss are gonna
come clean, right now.

28:06.898 --> 28:08.723
We want a meeting with Venganza.

28:09.364 --> 28:11.867
- I don't know where she is.
- I'm sorry, what?

28:11.900 --> 28:15.148
I've got two K-and-R companies
trying to find her, my own boss.

28:15.537 --> 28:20.276
Hey, you really have no idea
where she split to?

28:20.310 --> 28:21.979
She's running scared.

28:23.947 --> 28:26.315
(breathing deeply)

28:26.349 --> 28:28.051
FREDDIE: All right,
where the hell did you go?

28:28.083 --> 28:30.853
I know you gotta be
around here somewhere.

28:30.887 --> 28:33.190
OK, what do you need? You need space...

28:34.200 --> 28:35.333
_

28:35.358 --> 28:36.827
You need privacy...

28:36.860 --> 28:38.594
TANNER: <i>His venom glands were removed.</i>

28:38.628 --> 28:40.397
You need to be in the middle of nowhere.

28:40.429 --> 28:43.065
<i>We're nothin' more than cattle
to these things.</i>

28:43.689 --> 28:45.102
Proper tools for the cattle...

28:46.401 --> 28:48.404
(breathing heavily)

28:57.412 --> 28:58.515
<i>Agua fría...</i>

28:58.547 --> 29:00.116
<i>Agua fria.</i>

29:24.073 --> 29:25.140
TANNER: Chloe.

29:25.174 --> 29:27.144
(breathing heavily)

29:33.615 --> 29:38.054
Looks like I done wrangled me
a den master.

29:43.191 --> 29:44.660
- (groaning)
- Look at you,

29:44.694 --> 29:49.566
spreading that filthy seed
of yours all around.

29:49.599 --> 29:52.302
I'm gonna take my time with you, boy.

29:53.969 --> 29:55.572
Yes, sir.

29:55.604 --> 29:57.173
(groaning)

30:01.209 --> 30:04.246
There, there, little lady.

30:04.280 --> 30:09.152
You still got a little
more love left to give.

30:09.185 --> 30:11.121
(sobbing)

30:12.220 --> 30:13.268
No.

30:13.801 --> 30:16.125
(laughing)

30:17.960 --> 30:19.962
This one on the other hand...

30:20.667 --> 30:25.067
Time for him to join
his brothers and sisters

30:25.101 --> 30:28.338
in doing the Queen's good work.

30:34.276 --> 30:36.679
Welcome to a new life.

30:36.713 --> 30:39.382
- It's time to meet your maker.
- (screaming in pain)

30:39.415 --> 30:42.018
CAPORAL: Yes, sir!

30:42.051 --> 30:44.688
(groans in pain)

30:49.559 --> 30:51.127
(groans) No!

30:51.159 --> 30:53.964
(laughs)

30:56.466 --> 30:59.139
These demons, they were...
they were like her pets...

31:00.059 --> 31:02.338
BURT: <i>Queen Amaru,
when she ruled over Xibalba,</i>

31:02.371 --> 31:04.740
<i>she used them as enforcers.</i>

31:04.774 --> 31:09.312
<i>Every monster had a job.
A horrible, nasty job.</i>

31:09.344 --> 31:11.879
Tell 'em. Tell 'em about her blood.

31:11.913 --> 31:13.294
Tell 'em why she's out there
struttin' around

31:13.319 --> 31:15.076
in that little girl's body.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.368
When the <i>culebra</i> Lords
came to our realm,

31:19.522 --> 31:21.658
Amaru followed them here.

31:21.690 --> 31:24.526
She was incensed that they would call
themselves Lords.

31:24.560 --> 31:28.031
So they tricked her. Lured her
into a trap and killed her.

31:28.063 --> 31:30.033
Which is why she pulled a Corleone,

31:30.065 --> 31:32.768
had all the Lords whacked as soon
as she got her. All right.

31:32.802 --> 31:34.504
That's not all, man.

31:34.536 --> 31:36.472
They feasted on her flesh,

31:36.505 --> 31:39.542
<i>but they saved her blood
because it was so powerful.</i>

31:39.574 --> 31:41.611
<i>Gave it to Lord Oculto for safekeeping.</i>

31:41.643 --> 31:46.448
BURT: <i>He put it in the bloodwell,
and now she's inside Kate.</i>

31:46.482 --> 31:48.651
- What does she want?
- What? No. Fuck that.

31:49.238 --> 31:50.687
How do we get her back?

31:50.719 --> 31:52.087
How do we get it out of her?

31:52.121 --> 31:55.524
You don't. Kate's gone.

31:57.427 --> 31:58.594
(phone vibrating)

32:02.564 --> 32:04.000
What does he want?

32:05.101 --> 32:06.268
Ranger...

32:08.737 --> 32:10.474
What do you mean you found another one?

32:12.074 --> 32:13.476
FREDDIE: Another demon from hell.

32:13.508 --> 32:16.512
Agua Fría Ranch. Outside Houston.

32:18.081 --> 32:19.750
Just get here as fast as you can...

33:02.557 --> 33:04.527
- (snarls)
- Jesus!

33:15.571 --> 33:17.474
(groans)

33:17.506 --> 33:18.808
Help!

33:24.311 --> 33:25.580
(electrical charge)

33:25.612 --> 33:27.215
(groans)

33:29.682 --> 33:32.385
(wincing in pain)

33:32.419 --> 33:33.920
CAPORAL: Peacekeeper!

33:33.954 --> 33:36.591
It's your job to keep these
sons of bitches in line.

33:36.623 --> 33:39.360
(groaning in pain)

33:39.392 --> 33:40.961
That's some job you got.

33:40.995 --> 33:44.599
(breathing heavily)
Someone's gotta do it, right?

33:47.935 --> 33:49.230
Do they?

33:50.437 --> 33:52.840
I'm being rude with this rag on my face.

33:59.545 --> 34:03.416
Trusted the wrong snake, once.
Should've known better.

34:04.052 --> 34:06.555
Son of a bitch went on
and bit me right in the face.

34:06.580 --> 34:08.655
Is that why you torture <i>culebras?</i>

34:08.688 --> 34:11.858
What you call torture, I call salvation.

34:16.030 --> 34:18.766
Why do you think
we take away their venom?

34:18.797 --> 34:20.967
That's their power.

34:21.001 --> 34:24.005
World's gonna need
a few brave souls like us

34:24.036 --> 34:28.342
to help to restore
the natural order of things.

34:28.373 --> 34:30.342
Keep these animals in line,

34:30.376 --> 34:32.346
instead of lettin' 'em run wild.

34:36.483 --> 34:38.985
Go on, now. Take it.

34:39.783 --> 34:43.822
Prove to me you're willing
to keep these snakes in line.

34:44.453 --> 34:46.494
Starting with the professor here.

35:03.943 --> 35:05.445
Wakey wakey.

35:07.427 --> 35:08.996
(groans)

35:09.450 --> 35:10.618
Ranger?

35:11.583 --> 35:12.752
Ranger.

35:14.601 --> 35:17.470
Why, aren't you a sight for sore eyes.

35:18.959 --> 35:20.361
You deserve this...

35:21.961 --> 35:25.766
and I want you conscious
for every little bit of it.

35:27.194 --> 35:28.996
(grunts)

35:33.573 --> 35:38.012
Any last words, you slippery bastard?

35:46.153 --> 35:47.722
(groans)

35:48.921 --> 35:50.490
Get them!

36:08.575 --> 36:09.777
(Tanner grunts)

36:12.546 --> 36:13.948
(bottles shattering)

36:15.416 --> 36:17.418
(tail whiplashes)

36:17.450 --> 36:20.655
I'll kill you with my bare hands
if I have to.

36:22.923 --> 36:24.024
(screams)

36:24.057 --> 36:25.459
Son of a bitch!

36:30.630 --> 36:31.965
(groaning in pain)

36:34.934 --> 36:36.371
(screaming)

36:39.773 --> 36:41.441
Gonzalez! Think fast!

36:45.945 --> 36:47.981
(groans)

36:57.958 --> 36:59.793
Thanks for not, uh, you know,

36:59.827 --> 37:04.131
makin' me a mezzo-soprano
with your little knife back there.

37:04.164 --> 37:05.666
Appreciate it. (sighs)

37:06.867 --> 37:07.935
Just tryin' to keep the peace.

37:07.967 --> 37:10.036
- (rustling)
- Thanks, man.

37:18.811 --> 37:20.447
Step aside.

37:20.481 --> 37:24.601
I see your face healed
nicely after my little kiss.

37:25.084 --> 37:27.487
(screams)

37:28.588 --> 37:30.056
(hisses)

37:41.907 --> 37:44.978
Sometimes, there's only one way
to skin a cat.

37:47.508 --> 37:52.179
Peacekeeper. I've heard a lot about you.
Good stuff.

37:52.211 --> 37:53.646
What the hell are you supposed to be?

37:53.680 --> 37:55.816
Well, I got a PhD in Cultural Studies,

37:55.849 --> 37:57.985
but my friends call me Sex Machine.

38:00.186 --> 38:01.889
Right. (snickers)

38:03.256 --> 38:04.258
Gentlemen.

38:04.751 --> 38:06.287
- Professor.
- Professor.

38:07.440 --> 38:08.975
Burt.

38:10.630 --> 38:11.798
Burt.

38:14.267 --> 38:15.869
- Hey, Burt...
- What?

38:16.970 --> 38:19.259
I already saved your ass once.

38:19.292 --> 38:20.673
Take it easy, man.

38:20.706 --> 38:24.144
You said he was the slave master.
Where are the slaves?

38:27.180 --> 38:28.549
Shit.

38:32.084 --> 38:33.853
They were all in here.

38:33.887 --> 38:35.555
(sighs) She's already taken them.

38:35.588 --> 38:37.023
What are you talking about?

38:37.057 --> 38:38.491
Amaru! If she made these slaves,

38:38.523 --> 38:40.860
then she's gonna... try to open it.

38:40.894 --> 38:42.296
Open what?

38:42.329 --> 38:45.566
The door. To Xibalba. Fuck.

38:45.599 --> 38:47.635
And you wanted to know
what she's gonna do?

38:47.668 --> 38:48.869
She's gonna open that door

38:48.901 --> 38:51.271
and let it all just pour through.

38:51.305 --> 38:54.073
Holy fuck, it's gonna be
hell on earth, bitches.

38:54.106 --> 38:57.210
Hell on earth.

39:42.122 --> 39:44.191
(ground quivering)

40:01.273 --> 40:02.809
(crackling)

40:02.842 --> 40:04.045
