00:00.018 --> 00:01.919
Previously, on "Legends of Tomorrow"...

00:01.922 --> 00:04.297
Thank you for notifying us of
Detective Hunter's whereabouts.

00:04.299 --> 00:06.289
Now the Legends are
free to fly the skies?

00:06.292 --> 00:08.119
The Time Bureau has bigger
things to worry about

00:08.122 --> 00:09.134
than a bunch of idiots.

00:09.137 --> 00:10.820
Mallus is getting
stronger, Captain Lance.

00:10.823 --> 00:11.845
There is a war coming,

00:11.848 --> 00:14.049
and history needs you to be ready.

00:15.059 --> 00:17.693
- Do I know you?
- No, no.

00:17.695 --> 00:18.921
I'm Marty.

00:18.924 --> 00:20.690
So, you're Leonard Snart's doppelganger?

00:20.693 --> 00:23.264
No, I'm Leonard Snart,
but you can call me Leo.

00:23.267 --> 00:24.554
Ah!

00:24.557 --> 00:26.468
I'm asking you to let me die,

00:26.470 --> 00:28.604
so that you may live.

00:37.581 --> 00:40.182
This is the last store in
town with the Beebo dolls,

00:40.184 --> 00:41.757
Clarissa, I... I promise.

00:41.760 --> 00:45.687
I am not leaving without one for Lily.

00:45.689 --> 00:48.156
Professor Stein, Merry Christmas.

00:48.158 --> 00:50.492
And a Happy Hanukah to you, Chuck.

00:50.494 --> 00:53.061
Every kid needs a Beebo doll, right?

00:53.063 --> 00:54.796
So it would seem.

00:54.798 --> 00:57.366
I got one! I can't believe I got one!

00:59.403 --> 01:01.270
I don't suppose you can tell me

01:01.272 --> 01:03.171
how many Beebos you have back there?

01:03.173 --> 01:04.572
Plenty. Don't worry about it.

01:06.710 --> 01:09.210
Actually, we just ran out them.

01:09.213 --> 01:11.406
- Uh, but you just said...
- I'm sorry, folks.

01:11.409 --> 01:14.283
We are expecting a new
shipment in February.

01:14.285 --> 01:15.851
February?

01:15.853 --> 01:18.520
Five-year-olds don't wait until February.

01:18.522 --> 01:21.623
Wait! There's one
more Beebo right there.

01:22.660 --> 01:23.925
Move!

01:26.397 --> 01:27.663
Think, Marty.

01:32.870 --> 01:34.609
Distance of about six meters.

01:34.612 --> 01:36.345
Allowing for air resistance.

01:36.348 --> 01:38.656
Breathe in, hold...

01:56.327 --> 01:58.827
Eureka! I've got it!

02:00.898 --> 02:03.165
Get him!

02:06.670 --> 02:08.036
Barbarians!

02:19.430 --> 02:20.882
Great Scott.

02:23.987 --> 02:25.220
Barbarians?

02:31.595 --> 02:36.765
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

02:39.937 --> 02:42.070
Gideon said that you wanted to see me.

02:42.072 --> 02:44.553
Come in. Have a seat.

02:48.212 --> 02:50.545
You comfortable?

02:50.547 --> 02:53.071
I know the Legends have lost a friend.

02:53.074 --> 02:54.766
I've been there.

02:54.769 --> 02:57.352
I wanna help you guys
through the grieving period.

02:57.355 --> 02:59.588
Oh, that's... that's very sweet of you.

02:59.590 --> 03:01.923
I wanna give you the chance
to get anything off your chest,

03:01.925 --> 03:03.258
anything at all.

03:03.260 --> 03:05.274
What would you like to say...

03:06.797 --> 03:10.599
To Professor Martin Stein?

03:13.488 --> 03:16.671
I... I think that everyone
copes in their own ways.

03:16.673 --> 03:20.041
It's clear the Legends are
ill-equipped to cope at all.

03:20.043 --> 03:22.677
This way? This is wrong.

03:22.679 --> 03:24.212
Uh, actually, there is one question

03:24.214 --> 03:26.148
- I never got to ask Marty.
- Great.

03:26.150 --> 03:27.983
When I reduce the
Waverider's coefficient

03:27.985 --> 03:29.684
of sinusoidal depleneration,

03:29.686 --> 03:32.654
it seems to inversely hyper-celerate.

03:32.656 --> 03:34.222
Let's hear it again.

03:34.224 --> 03:37.000
What would you like to
say to me, Nathaniel?

03:37.003 --> 03:38.391
Still a little too nasally.

03:38.394 --> 03:41.724
Remember, you speak very precisely.

03:41.727 --> 03:44.900
This is therapy, not acting class.

03:44.902 --> 03:47.302
Nice! That's the right
level of frustration.

03:47.304 --> 03:49.727
That's very Stein. Now
just do it with the puppet.

03:51.691 --> 03:54.309
My goodness, you're really
working out some rage issues

03:54.311 --> 03:55.877
with, uh, Professor Stein.

03:55.879 --> 03:59.080
No, I just hate puppets.

03:59.082 --> 04:01.483
All right, I am... I am
putting the puppet away.

04:01.485 --> 04:04.152
I... I get it now. That
wasn't the best tactic.

04:04.154 --> 04:07.355
Look, Jax, I think that you,
even more so than the others,

04:07.357 --> 04:09.858
must be in pain about this.

04:09.860 --> 04:11.760
He died so I could live.

04:11.762 --> 04:14.229
- End of story.
- It wasn't your fault.

04:14.231 --> 04:16.630
I should never have given
him that Firestorm cure.

04:16.632 --> 04:18.867
I should've been strong
enough for both of us.

04:18.869 --> 04:20.535
- I...
- Mm...

04:21.839 --> 04:23.839
All right, you know, no.

04:23.841 --> 04:26.575
We're not doing this.

04:28.679 --> 04:30.078
What was that?

04:30.080 --> 04:31.913
An Anachronism caused a disturbance

04:31.915 --> 04:34.282
in the Temporal Zone,
which created a Timequake.

04:34.284 --> 04:37.152
And this is where Marty
would've said, "Fascinating."

04:38.622 --> 04:40.430
All right, everybody,

04:40.433 --> 04:42.641
I know you're sad, so this
is what we're gonna do.

04:42.644 --> 04:45.759
I want you to take all of
your feelings about Martin

04:45.762 --> 04:47.360
and put it in a box,

04:47.363 --> 04:50.318
and then, I want you to close the box,

04:50.321 --> 04:51.978
and then, you're gonna lock the box.

04:51.981 --> 04:53.542
Well, that sounds healthy.

04:53.543 --> 04:55.288
Maybe not, but we got a job to do.

04:55.291 --> 04:57.198
Gideon, the Anachronism, please.

04:57.200 --> 04:59.401
Uh, Level 12?

04:59.403 --> 05:01.102
Level Ten didn't do it justice.

05:01.104 --> 05:03.338
Leif Eriksson's Vikings set up a colony

05:03.340 --> 05:06.205
in the New World around 1000 A.D.

05:06.208 --> 05:09.244
Little known fact, the
Vikings "discovered"

05:09.246 --> 05:12.180
the Americas 492 years before Columbus,

05:12.182 --> 05:14.730
but due to Eriksson's
adoption of Christianity,

05:14.733 --> 05:16.733
the Vikings decided
to pack up their bags

05:16.736 --> 05:18.019
and head home.

05:18.021 --> 05:19.888
Sorry, Gideon, you were saying?

05:19.891 --> 05:22.052
In this version of
history, the Vikings stayed

05:22.055 --> 05:24.222
and conquered all of North America,

05:24.224 --> 05:27.024
or as it's called now, New Valhalla.

05:27.026 --> 05:29.744
- Cool hat.
- How many beers is that?

05:29.747 --> 05:31.201
It's not even noon yet.

05:31.204 --> 05:33.212
You have a problem, Mickey.

05:33.215 --> 05:36.082
I don't have a problem. Now shut up.

05:36.085 --> 05:38.586
All right, let's go.

05:38.589 --> 05:41.314
I don't think the Legends
are ready for the field.

05:41.317 --> 05:42.502
Listen, Leo,

05:42.505 --> 05:45.339
kicking ass is how we heal.

05:49.386 --> 05:51.019
I don't like it, sister.

05:51.021 --> 05:52.387
This land is bountiful,

05:52.389 --> 05:56.124
but these people, these Skraelings,

05:56.126 --> 05:57.792
they're skilled warriors.

05:57.794 --> 05:59.360
We should not challenge them.

05:59.362 --> 06:01.463
It's time to return home to Greenland.

06:01.465 --> 06:04.032
Brother, this continent is vast.

06:04.034 --> 06:05.333
Who knows how far west it goes,

06:05.335 --> 06:08.227
and what riches it has to plunder.

06:08.230 --> 06:11.739
It is our destiny to
conquer all of New Valhalla.

06:11.741 --> 06:14.476
That's Leif Erikkson
and his sister, Freydis.

06:14.478 --> 06:16.992
Yeah, this moment has huge
historical significance.

06:16.995 --> 06:18.250
It determines whether or not

06:18.253 --> 06:19.649
the Vikings leave North America,

06:19.652 --> 06:21.719
which, for me, is very exciting, cau...

06:22.252 --> 06:24.352
You okay, man?

06:24.354 --> 06:25.820
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

06:25.822 --> 06:28.323
Uh, let's just stay on mission.

06:28.325 --> 06:30.058
Okay.

06:30.060 --> 06:32.727
The Christian monks say that endless war

06:32.729 --> 06:34.963
means our people will never know peace.

06:34.965 --> 06:37.599
It is what the Blue God
has demanded, brother.

06:39.042 --> 06:40.828
The Anachronism isn't a weapon.

06:40.831 --> 06:43.537
Uh, guys, we're dealing
with some kind of Blue God.

06:43.540 --> 06:44.672
Found him.

06:49.446 --> 06:51.012
Is that...

06:51.014 --> 06:53.014
Martin?

06:53.016 --> 06:54.616
Martin's the Anachronism.

06:54.618 --> 06:56.918
They used his genius to
conquer the New World.

06:56.920 --> 07:00.522
Ju... hey, it's supposed
to be a stealth mission.

07:00.524 --> 07:01.890
Dammit!

07:04.394 --> 07:06.281
Jax, back into position now.

07:07.953 --> 07:10.185
Jefferson? What are you doing here?

07:10.188 --> 07:13.368
- I... I haven't seen you since...
- 1987.

07:13.370 --> 07:14.758
Uh, don't worry, Martin,

07:14.761 --> 07:17.896
I... I'ma get you out of here.

07:17.899 --> 07:20.208
Wa... wait! No, no, no, no, no, no!

07:20.210 --> 07:21.709
Ah!

07:24.748 --> 07:26.347
- You all right?
- Most certainly not!

07:26.349 --> 07:27.682
Look out!

07:29.986 --> 07:32.654
I haven't had a bath
or a change of clothes

07:32.656 --> 07:34.155
for over a week.

07:34.157 --> 07:35.657
I... I... I could've died.

07:38.395 --> 07:40.528
- Was it something I said?
- No, nothing. It's fine.

07:40.531 --> 07:41.796
We just gotta get out of here

07:41.798 --> 07:43.234
before the rest of the clan comes.

07:43.237 --> 07:44.804
Uh, no, no, no, wait, wait, wait, wait.

07:44.807 --> 07:46.440
- We have to go back.
- Go back for what?

07:46.443 --> 07:48.242
- My Beebo.
- What the hell is a Beebo?

07:48.245 --> 07:50.779
As in Cuddle Me Beebo?

07:50.782 --> 07:53.216
It's a Hannukah gift for Lily.

07:53.219 --> 07:55.086
We're not going back for some damn toy!

07:55.089 --> 07:56.563
You don't understand!

07:56.566 --> 08:00.447
That damn toy is gonna change history!

08:00.450 --> 08:02.617
The four-eyed man has escaped.

08:02.619 --> 08:04.886
No matter.

08:04.888 --> 08:07.655
We still have our God...

08:15.632 --> 08:18.649
Beebo hungry.

08:18.652 --> 08:21.936
And our God hungers for battle!

08:23.707 --> 08:27.041
Beebo! Beebo! Beebo! Beebo!

08:27.043 --> 08:29.606
Beebo! Beebo! Beebo! Beebo!

08:33.618 --> 08:35.164
All right, let me get this straight.

08:35.168 --> 08:38.071
So, the Vikings think
that Beebo is a God,

08:38.073 --> 08:40.765
Beebo as in, "Wah, wah, Beebo love you"?

08:40.767 --> 08:42.534
As preposterous as it sounds,

08:42.535 --> 08:45.845
that obnoxious toy is the
only reason I survived.

08:45.848 --> 08:47.538
The Vikings who found me in the woods

08:47.541 --> 08:49.717
were about to kill me, when Beebo spoke.

08:49.720 --> 08:53.278
It... it was like a... a spell
was cast over the barbarians.

08:53.280 --> 08:55.246
Here, this should warm you up.

08:55.248 --> 08:57.782
- Earl Grey?
- With a little bit of brandy.

08:57.784 --> 08:59.851
Ah, my favorite. Thank you, Jefferson.

08:59.853 --> 09:00.985
It does make sense.

09:00.988 --> 09:03.287
Norse mythology is filled
with creatures like Beebo:

09:03.290 --> 09:05.023
trolls, gnomes, tumptens.

09:05.025 --> 09:06.991
Okay, sure, but thinking he's a God

09:06.993 --> 09:08.927
who wants them to conquer the New World?

09:08.929 --> 09:10.895
You see, at first, the
Vikings thought that

09:10.897 --> 09:13.064
only I could make Beebo talk,

09:13.066 --> 09:15.233
but it soon became clear
that my translations

09:15.235 --> 09:18.136
were not what Lief's
sister wanted to hear.

09:18.138 --> 09:20.004
Freydis usurped my position

09:20.006 --> 09:22.576
and twisted Beebo's
words for her own agenda.

09:22.579 --> 09:25.235
All right, sounds like we
gotta go get that Beebo,

09:25.238 --> 09:26.610
and send the Vikings packing.

09:26.613 --> 09:29.114
Zari, can you take young Stein
to where he can get cleaned up?

09:29.116 --> 09:31.483
- Come on.
- I... I can help him,

09:31.485 --> 09:34.519
- 'cause I've got nothing...
- It's okay. Zari's got it.

09:34.521 --> 09:35.687
Hm.

09:39.960 --> 09:42.260
Mart... Marty... Mar... Martin...

09:42.262 --> 09:44.562
you're looking young and lively.

09:44.564 --> 09:46.731
- Uh, good to see you.
- You too, Raymond.

09:46.733 --> 09:49.067
Uh, one question: Where's me?

09:49.069 --> 09:51.269
- Uh, you...
- At peace.

09:51.271 --> 09:53.705
With your family for
the... For the holidays.

09:53.707 --> 09:55.440
Ah, I almost forgot.

09:55.442 --> 09:57.008
Happy Hannukah.

09:57.010 --> 10:00.378
Uh, Happy Hannukah.

10:00.380 --> 10:01.713
I'll drink to that.

10:05.270 --> 10:07.036
Ah!

10:07.039 --> 10:10.488
That's disgusting. What's
wrong with this beer?

10:10.490 --> 10:12.290
Man, can you believe Sara?

10:12.292 --> 10:14.095
She doesn't trust me around young Stein.

10:14.098 --> 10:15.393
So you're saying you weren't planning on

10:15.395 --> 10:18.029
warning Martin about him dying?

10:18.031 --> 10:20.899
Okay, fine, but... But come on, man.

10:20.901 --> 10:22.734
Grey dies, and then, all of a sudden,

10:22.736 --> 10:24.868
his younger self gets displaced in time?

10:24.871 --> 10:27.005
Yeah, I know, it's crazy that
we keep bumping into ourselves.

10:27.007 --> 10:27.829
Yeah.

10:27.832 --> 10:29.974
I mean, Ray and the baby Dominator,

10:29.976 --> 10:31.798
and Sir Stein and his killer stash.

10:31.801 --> 10:32.649
Mick's dad.

10:32.652 --> 10:35.019
I mean, this can't
just be a coincidence.

10:37.184 --> 10:39.250
What if this is fate's way

10:39.252 --> 10:41.286
of saying we should step up?

10:41.288 --> 10:43.142
That we can actually improve things?

10:43.145 --> 10:45.423
Martin made his choice, Jax,

10:45.425 --> 10:47.225
and we should be honoring his sacrifice,

10:47.227 --> 10:49.761
- not trying to undo it.
- Yeah, but it's Grey.

10:49.763 --> 10:52.197
I mean, how can we not tell him?

10:52.199 --> 10:54.132
Because what if knowing about his death

10:54.134 --> 10:56.968
makes young Marty choose not
to create the Firestorm matrix

10:56.970 --> 10:59.331
or meet you or step foot on this ship?

10:59.334 --> 11:01.173
He never would've wanted
you to risk the present

11:01.175 --> 11:03.274
- to save him in the past.
- And how exactly

11:03.276 --> 11:05.706
do you know what he
would've wanted, Ray?

11:05.709 --> 11:07.245
You weren't psychically connected to him

11:07.247 --> 11:09.147
for three years.

11:14.454 --> 11:15.753
Gideon!

11:15.755 --> 11:17.655
The beer tastes like sewage water.

11:17.657 --> 11:19.824
Was that a question, Mr. Rory?

11:19.826 --> 11:21.259
Don't get smart, lady.

11:21.261 --> 11:23.161
I adjusted the fabrication settings.

11:23.163 --> 11:26.030
The Waverider's now a dry ship.

11:26.032 --> 11:28.730
No alcohol allowed.

11:28.733 --> 11:29.996
You son of a...

11:29.999 --> 11:31.598
You said your drinking wasn't a problem.

11:31.600 --> 11:33.637
If you can go a couple
of days without booze,

11:33.640 --> 11:36.474
- you've proven your point.
- A couple of days?

11:36.476 --> 11:38.877
- 42 hours?
- 48.

11:40.881 --> 11:42.780
So, I checked the lunar calendar,

11:42.782 --> 11:44.782
and today is Yuletide.

11:44.784 --> 11:46.384
Oh, like Christmas?

11:46.386 --> 11:48.641
Well, before Christians rebranded it,

11:48.644 --> 11:51.990
wreaths, trees, elves were
all Norse traditions first.

11:51.992 --> 11:55.159
And tonight, Leif is throwing
a huge Yuletide feast.

11:55.161 --> 11:57.417
Which is the perfect cover for us.

11:57.420 --> 11:59.130
Oh...

11:59.132 --> 12:00.660
we could dress up as Norse Gods...

12:00.663 --> 12:02.467
...and order them to
head back to Greenland

12:02.469 --> 12:04.456
or face our wrath!

12:04.459 --> 12:06.738
- Worst idea you ever had.
- That's a terrible idea.

12:06.740 --> 12:08.246
- Mm-hm.
- Mm.

12:08.249 --> 12:10.438
Incoming transmission from Agent Sharpe.

12:10.441 --> 12:12.577
Oh...

12:12.579 --> 12:15.280
Put her on.

12:15.282 --> 12:16.714
Agent Sharpe,

12:16.716 --> 12:18.816
it's been awhile, thankfully.

12:18.818 --> 12:20.785
- Captain Lance.
- Let me guess,

12:20.787 --> 12:22.553
you saw that there's
a Level 12 Anachronism,

12:22.555 --> 12:24.088
and you're calling to
lecture me on everything

12:24.090 --> 12:27.025
- that we're doing wrong.
- No.

12:27.027 --> 12:28.893
- Okay, yes...
- Hm.

12:28.895 --> 12:30.589
But I also heard about Martin Stein,

12:30.592 --> 12:33.331
and I'm calling to
express my condolences.

12:33.333 --> 12:35.233
Well, thank you,

12:35.235 --> 12:37.402
but my team and I,

12:37.404 --> 12:39.370
- we have it under control.
- I hope so,

12:39.372 --> 12:41.439
because the Legends fixing a Level 12

12:41.441 --> 12:44.075
under normal circumstances
would be a Beebo Day miracle.

12:46.513 --> 12:48.146
Did you just say Beebo Day?

12:48.148 --> 12:50.248
December 25th, Beebo Day,

12:50.250 --> 12:52.450
when families exchange
gifts and sing silly songs

12:52.452 --> 12:53.839
and discover that
they can no longer live

12:53.841 --> 12:56.688
under the same roof?

12:56.690 --> 12:58.923
Beebo Day's part of the
Anachronism, isn't it?

12:58.925 --> 13:01.759
- Yeah.
- Yeah, never felt right.

13:01.761 --> 13:04.162
This Anachronism is cementing fast,

13:04.164 --> 13:06.757
and to be honest, my team is
still pretty raw from losing Stein.

13:06.760 --> 13:09.766
We could use an outside perspective.

13:09.769 --> 13:11.210
Are you asking for my help?

13:11.213 --> 13:13.137
No.

13:13.139 --> 13:16.207
Okay, yes.

13:16.209 --> 13:18.609
All right...

13:18.611 --> 13:20.078
what's the plan?

13:24.417 --> 13:26.584
You ready to see the Legends in action?

13:26.586 --> 13:29.249
The goal is to do this
peacefully, without action.

13:29.252 --> 13:31.285
There's a first time
for everything, I guess.

13:31.288 --> 13:32.924
Hail, Leif son of Erik.

13:32.926 --> 13:34.625
I, Nathaniel Henryson.

13:34.627 --> 13:36.861
Hail, Nathanial son of Henry.

13:36.863 --> 13:38.696
A Yuletide surprise.

13:38.698 --> 13:40.865
Are you sure this is wise, brother?

13:40.867 --> 13:43.968
We know nothing about these people.

13:43.970 --> 13:45.670
We brought booze.

13:55.916 --> 13:57.882
Tell me of your clan.

13:57.884 --> 14:00.318
You certainly are an odd collection.

14:00.320 --> 14:01.719
We're from all over.

14:01.721 --> 14:04.155
But we stick together the best we can.

14:04.157 --> 14:07.291
Although, recently, we lost a brother.

14:07.293 --> 14:09.761
Ah, that can be difficult.

14:09.763 --> 14:11.896
I've lost far too many men
and women in my own clan.

14:11.898 --> 14:13.998
It has made you soft, brother.

14:14.000 --> 14:17.835
Let's not fight in front
of our guest, sister.

14:17.837 --> 14:19.203
As far as strategy goes,

14:19.205 --> 14:20.938
this would not be my first pick.

14:20.940 --> 14:23.674
Why not? They welcomed us in.

14:23.676 --> 14:25.910
We get Beebo, we get out.

14:25.912 --> 14:28.146
The Bureau has rules about
fraternizing with the locals,

14:28.148 --> 14:31.115
and these costumes are ridiculous.

14:31.117 --> 14:32.817
Nah, you look good.

14:35.722 --> 14:37.955
- Give me that!
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

14:37.957 --> 14:40.658
No booze means no booze, Mickey.

14:40.660 --> 14:43.161
- Stop calling me that.
- You have 35 hours left.

14:43.163 --> 14:44.862
Can you handle it?

14:44.864 --> 14:47.398
Are you ready to admit
that you have a problem?

14:47.400 --> 14:48.766
You're the problem!

14:58.078 --> 15:01.046
Ah, there you are, you little bastard.

15:01.049 --> 15:03.203
Beebo thirsty.

15:03.206 --> 15:04.972
Uh...

15:08.855 --> 15:10.843
You dare to steal from our God?

15:10.846 --> 15:12.412
He's not gonna drink it.

15:12.415 --> 15:16.394
Our Gods do not tolerate such insolence.

15:16.396 --> 15:18.629
Beebo will decide your fate.

15:27.893 --> 15:29.559
Anyone have eyes on Beebo?

15:29.562 --> 15:31.145
Short, blue, looking for cuddles?

15:31.147 --> 15:33.181
Yep, we're working on it.

15:33.183 --> 15:34.983
Here we go!

15:38.088 --> 15:39.721
Ah!

15:39.723 --> 15:42.254
By Odin's Spear, you bested us.

15:42.257 --> 15:45.260
Beautiful, and they can hold their mead.

15:45.262 --> 15:46.726
Tell us...

15:46.729 --> 15:49.831
which of these clansmen
are your husbands,

15:49.833 --> 15:51.032
and we'll kill them.

15:51.034 --> 15:52.467
- Oh.
- Hm.

15:52.469 --> 15:53.968
I'm not really the husband kind.

15:53.970 --> 15:56.971
Perfect! Me neither!

15:56.973 --> 15:58.673
All right, you guys said if we won,

15:58.675 --> 16:01.676
you'd take us to see your Blue God.

16:01.678 --> 16:02.877
Two out of three.

16:04.381 --> 16:06.948
- Ah!
- Fellow warriors...

16:08.785 --> 16:12.453
Our guest has been stealing
mead from the Blue God,

16:12.455 --> 16:14.132
and now,

16:14.135 --> 16:16.224
our God will render judgment.

16:16.226 --> 16:20.062
Beebo! Beebo! Beebo! Beebo!

16:20.101 --> 16:23.382
Beebo! Beebo! Beebo! Beebo!

16:23.429 --> 16:26.484
Beebo! Beebo! Beebo! Beebo!

16:26.585 --> 16:28.552
Beebo! Beebo!

16:30.507 --> 16:33.041
How judge you, Beebo?

16:36.513 --> 16:39.200
Beebo hungry.

16:39.203 --> 16:42.383
Our God demands justice.

16:42.385 --> 16:44.452
To the pyre!

16:46.890 --> 16:48.765
Nate and Amaya, you're on Beebo.

16:48.768 --> 16:52.560
Everyone else, let's make sure
Rory doesn't get burned alive.

16:52.562 --> 16:54.395
Freydis, it's Yuletide.

16:54.397 --> 16:56.731
Let's not ruin it.

16:56.733 --> 17:01.235
More wood, so bright Odin
can see it from Valhalla.

17:01.237 --> 17:03.371
Is it weird that I find her hot?

17:03.373 --> 17:05.740
Weird, but then again, not surprising.

17:07.344 --> 17:08.976
Leo, can you take care of the fire?

17:08.978 --> 17:11.425
Copy that, Captain Lance.

17:11.429 --> 17:13.290
I thought you said this
was an undercover operation.

17:13.292 --> 17:16.416
Well, blowing your
cover is half the fun.

17:16.419 --> 17:18.553
Into the flames!

17:18.555 --> 17:19.762
Now.

17:33.436 --> 17:35.603
Uh, it's a sign!

17:35.605 --> 17:38.639
Beebo does not want our
clansman to be burned.

17:41.411 --> 17:43.144
The Blue God has shown mercy.

17:45.148 --> 17:48.249
I luh-luh-love you.

17:50.253 --> 17:53.187
- I accidentally squeezed him.
- He's so damn huggable.

17:53.189 --> 17:55.456
Unhand him or die!

18:06.903 --> 18:08.603
I am leaving myself wide open,

18:08.605 --> 18:10.204
and you can't land a single punch.

18:10.206 --> 18:11.639
Uh, yeah, I'm just warming up.

18:11.641 --> 18:13.007
Uh-huh.

18:13.009 --> 18:14.809
Let's up the stakes then.

18:14.811 --> 18:17.578
Loser takes the other's
chores for a month.

18:17.580 --> 18:20.381
Ha-ha! Deal.

18:20.383 --> 18:22.917
I know what you're
trying to do, by the way.

18:22.919 --> 18:25.953
- What's that?
- Tying to distract me.

18:25.955 --> 18:28.990
I'm also trying to beat you.

18:28.992 --> 18:30.792
Is the distraction working?

18:30.794 --> 18:33.694
- I still wanna warn Grey.
- So do it.

18:33.696 --> 18:36.297
I would've warned my
brother, if I had the chance.

18:36.299 --> 18:38.900
- Yeah, but Sara...
- Just 'cause she's the Captain

18:38.902 --> 18:40.902
doesn't mean you have to
do everything she says.

18:40.904 --> 18:43.471
Yeah, no, I know, but we...

18:43.473 --> 18:45.606
Ah, Jefferson, there you are.

18:45.608 --> 18:47.977
Ah, game over!

18:47.980 --> 18:49.510
Ah! Come... come on!

18:49.512 --> 18:52.046
- I'm scary good at this.
- Uh, you're just okay.

18:52.048 --> 18:53.777
Forgive the interruption,

18:53.780 --> 18:56.684
but I would very much like to
return to my Clarissa and Lily,

18:56.686 --> 18:59.921
with or without that wretched Beebo.

18:59.923 --> 19:03.858
Oh, yeah, sure, I'll
take you in the jumpship.

19:03.860 --> 19:06.894
Yo. This is your chance.

19:06.896 --> 19:11.105
Find some loophole, like
I did with Helen of Troy.

19:11.108 --> 19:12.874
You can save your friend's life.

19:25.348 --> 19:26.647
Nathaniel!

19:48.605 --> 19:50.671
Nate! Nate! I'm open!

19:51.975 --> 19:53.641
Oh...

19:55.093 --> 19:57.994
Bee...

19:58.129 --> 19:59.580
Bow...

20:05.889 --> 20:08.122
I hate puppets.

20:08.124 --> 20:09.824
Beebo... want

20:09.826 --> 20:12.560
cuddle...

20:26.163 --> 20:29.343
I know how much you
wanted to believe, sister,

20:29.345 --> 20:31.812
but Beebo's a false God

20:31.814 --> 20:34.815
full of false promises.

20:34.817 --> 20:36.484
We are Vikings.

20:36.486 --> 20:38.686
This is our land to conquer.

20:38.688 --> 20:41.155
It's time to go home

20:41.157 --> 20:43.157
and abandon this colony.

20:47.764 --> 20:51.065
It seems the Old Gods have abandoned us.

20:51.067 --> 20:54.602
Well, looks like the
Legends have saved Odin Day.

20:54.604 --> 20:56.270
Odin Day?

20:56.272 --> 20:58.613
Wait, you mean Christmas?

20:58.616 --> 21:00.182
Doesn't ring a bell.

21:00.185 --> 21:03.551
I thought we fixed the Anachronism.

21:10.320 --> 21:12.620
My name is Odin,

21:12.622 --> 21:15.823
ruler of Asgard.

21:15.825 --> 21:17.430
Damien Darhk...

21:17.433 --> 21:19.093
You know this guy?

21:19.095 --> 21:20.962
- And his daughter.
- See?

21:20.964 --> 21:23.931
I told you the Norse
God costumes would work.

21:23.933 --> 21:26.167
Bow to the King of the true Gods!

21:26.169 --> 21:28.001
He has left Valhalla

21:28.004 --> 21:30.338
to lead you into battle.

21:30.340 --> 21:33.441
Together, we will conquer the New World.

21:33.443 --> 21:36.611
Mick, no, we're outmatched.

21:36.613 --> 21:37.845
Let's go.

21:40.817 --> 21:42.917
Kneel before Odin, brother.

21:53.726 --> 21:54.890
That was unexpected.

21:54.893 --> 21:56.155
I mean, not the Darhks showing up.

21:56.157 --> 21:57.824
They seem to enjoy altering history.

21:57.827 --> 22:00.194
- You retreating.
- Well, Vikings are one thing.

22:00.197 --> 22:01.383
If we're gonna tangle with the Darhks,

22:01.385 --> 22:02.890
we have to get our heads on straight.

22:02.893 --> 22:05.312
I, for one, am glad
you're treading cautiously.

22:05.315 --> 22:07.500
We've arrived safely
in the Temporal Zone,

22:07.503 --> 22:09.023
but I'm afraid the Anachronism has...

22:09.026 --> 22:10.918
Let me guess, it's
worse. Thank you, Gideon.

22:13.010 --> 22:14.643
Another Timequake.

22:14.646 --> 22:16.495
We are not letting America go Viking.

22:16.498 --> 22:18.465
Ava, can you call the
Time Bureau for backup?

22:18.468 --> 22:20.715
Wait, wait, wait, are
we really that desperate?

22:22.052 --> 22:23.468
Yeah.

22:23.471 --> 22:25.219
Well, the last time we faced Nora Darhk,

22:25.222 --> 22:27.422
- she put Sara in a coma.
- Right.

22:27.424 --> 22:29.391
I'll, uh, speak to Director Bennett.

22:29.393 --> 22:30.926
Thank you.

22:34.198 --> 22:36.698
Wow, that's, uh, quite the getup.

22:36.700 --> 22:38.148
Where's Martin and Jax?

22:38.151 --> 22:40.034
Uh, they're on their
way back to Central City.

22:40.037 --> 22:42.370
Gotta get Martin home for the holidays.

22:54.854 --> 22:57.451
You've been awfully quiet, Jefferson.

22:57.454 --> 22:59.554
Uh, my bad. I've just had some...

22:59.556 --> 23:01.790
Some things on my mind.

23:05.162 --> 23:08.463
It's good to be home.

23:08.465 --> 23:10.999
I can't wait to see Clarissa and Lily.

23:11.001 --> 23:13.235
Listen...

23:13.237 --> 23:16.671
this is gonna sound crazy, okay,

23:16.673 --> 23:18.773
but you need to open this letter

23:18.775 --> 23:21.156
on November 28th, 2017.

23:21.159 --> 23:23.378
I've seen "Back to
the Future," Jefferson,

23:23.380 --> 23:26.773
that... that mockery of time
travel that Clarissa adores.

23:26.776 --> 23:28.150
I... I don't suppose this letter

23:28.152 --> 23:29.718
has anything to do with my future.

23:29.720 --> 23:31.419
Uh, this letter could save your life.

23:31.421 --> 23:33.889
Then I categorically refuse to take it.

23:33.891 --> 23:35.934
You know the dangers of
trying to improve history.

23:35.937 --> 23:37.726
No, no, this... This is your future.

23:37.728 --> 23:39.694
And your past.

23:39.696 --> 23:42.036
Give me a little credit.
I... I know the team was lying

23:42.039 --> 23:44.733
when they said I was visiting
family for the holidays.

23:44.735 --> 23:46.401
Then take the damn letter

23:46.403 --> 23:49.104
and stop being so stubborn.

23:50.941 --> 23:52.641
Think about your family.

23:54.978 --> 23:56.745
This letter is a loophole.

23:56.747 --> 24:00.782
Nothing changes until
November 28th, 2017.

24:00.784 --> 24:02.384
Please.

24:06.423 --> 24:08.490
Okay, Jefferson.

24:08.492 --> 24:10.292
Thank you.

24:20.453 --> 24:22.103
Hello, friend.

24:22.105 --> 24:23.772
Looking for booze?

24:23.774 --> 24:24.973
I'm not your friend.

24:24.975 --> 24:26.474
You almost died back there,

24:26.476 --> 24:28.210
and I know you're craving a drink.

24:28.212 --> 24:30.401
That's why it's so important to resist!

24:30.404 --> 24:32.004
You have to stop numbing yourself

24:32.007 --> 24:33.481
to fear and pain.

24:33.483 --> 24:36.200
That's when the true
transformation begins!

24:36.203 --> 24:38.186
Mickey!

24:38.188 --> 24:40.121
You're right. You're right.

24:40.123 --> 24:43.525
I... I apologize.
That... that was his name.

24:43.527 --> 24:45.973
Your Earth-X doppelganger
was my best friend.

24:45.976 --> 24:47.848
We grew up together in the Resistance.

24:47.851 --> 24:50.365
And when he died, I...

24:50.367 --> 24:52.167
I was devastated.

24:52.169 --> 24:54.369
But seeing you made me realize...

24:54.371 --> 24:56.838
I was a long way from acceptance.

24:56.840 --> 25:00.375
I didn't come onboard just
to help you process your loss.

25:00.377 --> 25:03.262
I came so I could process mine.

25:05.549 --> 25:09.778
Was that guttural sound your response?

25:09.781 --> 25:12.921
- To what?
- My heartfelt confession.

25:12.923 --> 25:14.723
I don't care. I wasn't listening.

25:14.725 --> 25:17.832
Well, the Mick Rory I knew

25:17.835 --> 25:20.595
did care, and he did listen.

25:20.597 --> 25:23.331
He was the kindest, most selfless person

25:23.333 --> 25:24.699
I've ever met,

25:24.701 --> 25:27.832
a far cry from the crude, alcoholic,

25:27.835 --> 25:31.206
oafish waste of space before me.

25:31.208 --> 25:32.539
I'm a disappointment?

25:32.542 --> 25:34.476
Well, the Leonard Snart that I knew

25:34.478 --> 25:36.544
was a cold, ruthless criminal,

25:36.546 --> 25:38.413
who didn't say boo about my drinking,

25:38.415 --> 25:40.348
because he knew I
could get the job done!

25:40.350 --> 25:43.385
I don't like you. You don't fit in.

25:43.387 --> 25:45.153
Why don't you go back
to that Nazi hellhole

25:45.155 --> 25:47.622
- you call home?
- Well, if that's how you feel,

25:47.624 --> 25:48.957
then I'll leave,

25:48.959 --> 25:50.892
as soon as we return from Vinland.

25:50.894 --> 25:52.327
- Good.
- Good.

25:52.329 --> 25:53.928
- Good!
- Good!

25:56.700 --> 25:58.637
Are we clear, Agent Sharpe?

25:58.640 --> 26:00.235
Crystal, sir.

26:00.237 --> 26:03.007
Please tell me you have good news.

26:03.010 --> 26:05.440
I'm afraid Director Bennett
doesn't believe this mission

26:05.442 --> 26:08.109
is the best use of our resources.

26:08.111 --> 26:10.895
So what, the Time Bureau
is just gonna let the Darhks

26:10.898 --> 26:12.947
run around and change history?

26:14.284 --> 26:16.351
The Time Bureau's in disarray.

26:16.353 --> 26:18.739
Ever since Rip was
sentenced to prison, we...

26:18.742 --> 26:21.222
Wait, Rip is in prison?

26:21.224 --> 26:23.124
He was hardly convincing
at the tribunal,

26:23.126 --> 26:25.340
raving about Mallus,
completely unapologetic.

26:25.343 --> 26:26.795
And in his absence,

26:26.797 --> 26:29.431
Damien Darhk has
recruited even more allies.

26:29.433 --> 26:30.812
Gideon, can you pull up

26:30.815 --> 26:32.733
what Director Bennett showed me, please?

26:34.071 --> 26:35.637
Grodd survived Vietnam.

26:35.639 --> 26:37.939
Darhk secured him a
means of time travel.

26:37.941 --> 26:39.007
Of course.

26:41.078 --> 26:43.067
Darhk and his daughter
are just too powerful.

26:43.070 --> 26:44.746
They have magic that
we don't understand.

26:44.748 --> 26:46.948
We've lost scores of
agents trying to fight them.

26:46.950 --> 26:48.717
So what? What does that mean?

26:48.719 --> 26:50.685
That you're just gonna
throw in the towel?

26:50.687 --> 26:53.521
We can't afford to lose anyone else.

26:53.523 --> 26:55.957
- And I can?
- No, I mean...

26:55.960 --> 26:59.994
Do you have any idea how
hard this has been on us?

26:59.996 --> 27:02.831
I really am sorry, Sara.

27:02.833 --> 27:05.340
Director Bennett has ordered me

27:05.343 --> 27:07.902
to return to the Time Bureau, so...

27:07.904 --> 27:09.679
Screw his orders.

27:09.682 --> 27:12.049
I need you here.

27:12.052 --> 27:14.476
Look, I know Darhk is personal for you,

27:14.478 --> 27:16.201
and you're the last person
to back out of a fight,

27:16.203 --> 27:18.980
but you asked me to give
you an outside perspective.

27:18.982 --> 27:21.216
If you're concerned about
the safety of your team,

27:21.218 --> 27:22.684
leave Vinland.

27:22.686 --> 27:24.619
This is not a fight the Legends can win.

27:38.820 --> 27:40.007
Hey.

27:40.009 --> 27:42.376
- You rang?
- Yes.

27:42.378 --> 27:45.112
Heard you took young Stein back to 1992.

27:45.114 --> 27:47.114
- Yep.
- How'd it go?

27:47.116 --> 27:48.765
He's just glad to be home.

27:50.719 --> 27:53.820
Okay, here's the deal.

27:53.822 --> 27:55.522
Backup is not coming.

27:55.524 --> 27:58.492
The Time Bureau thinks the
Darhks can't be defeated,

27:58.495 --> 28:00.761
and they're probably right.

28:00.763 --> 28:03.363
Leo asked us to talk about our feelings.

28:03.365 --> 28:05.766
Well, my feeling is
that history needs us

28:05.768 --> 28:06.890
to stop the Darhks,

28:06.893 --> 28:10.137
but after losing Stein,

28:10.139 --> 28:12.439
I can't lose anyone else.

28:14.518 --> 28:17.375
I need you guys to take
the Waverider and leave.

28:17.378 --> 28:18.844
Not without you.

28:18.847 --> 28:20.714
You can't face Darhk alone.

28:20.717 --> 28:23.084
I have a plan.

28:29.432 --> 28:31.332
I'm here to speak to Odin.

28:31.335 --> 28:32.902
Let her pass.

28:35.375 --> 28:37.708
My father will enjoy killing you.

28:40.269 --> 28:41.802
You've come alone.

28:41.804 --> 28:44.104
I'm here to make you an offer.

28:44.106 --> 28:46.540
Oh, this ought to be good.

28:49.503 --> 28:50.575
Whoo...

28:50.578 --> 28:52.646
Leave now, and I'll let you live.

28:52.648 --> 28:54.070
No.

28:55.338 --> 28:56.704
Hold up.

28:56.707 --> 28:58.740
Your plan sucks.

28:58.743 --> 29:01.321
- Pretty's right.
- Well, I can't do nothing.

29:01.323 --> 29:03.223
Yeah, but you can come
up with a better plan

29:03.225 --> 29:04.858
that, like, doesn't get you killed.

29:04.860 --> 29:07.227
Okay, Z, what's your big plan?

29:07.229 --> 29:08.562
Well, first of all,

29:08.565 --> 29:12.023
you don't enter the
Longhouse by yourself.

29:13.361 --> 29:15.635
My father will enjoy killing you.

29:17.065 --> 29:18.665
You've come alone.

29:18.668 --> 29:20.239
Not exactly.

29:27.149 --> 29:30.000
And then, Darhk will
have some sort of quip.

29:30.003 --> 29:32.771
Something evil, but
not too mustache-twirly.

29:32.774 --> 29:36.008
What, are you gonna huff and
puff till you blow my house in?

29:45.734 --> 29:48.268
What's the matter? Performance anxiety?

29:51.540 --> 29:53.992
So far, this works,

29:53.995 --> 29:56.132
but it doesn't solve our Nora problem.

29:56.135 --> 29:58.245
And what about the rest of the Vikings?

29:58.247 --> 30:00.614
Odin is under attack!

30:00.616 --> 30:04.242
Defend him, if you wanna see Valhalla.

30:04.245 --> 30:06.186
You're gonna need backup.

30:06.188 --> 30:07.976
Listen, Sara,

30:07.979 --> 30:10.991
just don't let Grey's death
teach us the wrong lessons.

30:10.993 --> 30:14.194
Either we do this
together or not at all.

30:16.165 --> 30:18.365
Gideon, plot a course for Vinland.

30:32.253 --> 30:35.415
What, are you gonna huff and
puff till you blow my house in?

30:39.388 --> 30:41.988
What's the matter? Performance anxiety?

30:46.295 --> 30:47.750
Ah!

30:49.674 --> 30:52.007
Odin is under attack!

30:52.010 --> 30:55.502
Defend him, if you wanna see Valhalla.

30:55.504 --> 30:58.572
Halt.

30:58.574 --> 31:00.695
It is I, Beebo,

31:00.698 --> 31:02.965
risen from the grave.

31:02.968 --> 31:05.602
Like Christ himself.

31:05.605 --> 31:07.109
Yeah...

31:07.112 --> 31:10.007
Yes, Jesus is the one true God, which...

31:10.010 --> 31:11.558
Doesn't mean science

31:11.560 --> 31:13.927
or evolution isn't real.

31:13.930 --> 31:17.223
Anyway, you need to return to Greenland,

31:17.226 --> 31:19.459
which, um, will soon be melting,

31:19.461 --> 31:21.161
thanks to global warming,

31:21.163 --> 31:22.629
which is also real.

31:25.501 --> 31:26.867
Whoo!

31:28.065 --> 31:30.232
Like a little fire?

31:30.235 --> 31:32.639
How 'bout a little ice?

31:50.003 --> 31:52.503
Nora...

31:52.506 --> 31:55.741
They killed the Valkyrie!

32:02.838 --> 32:04.337
Ah!

32:08.753 --> 32:10.019
Nora!

32:22.024 --> 32:23.890
Not this time.

32:29.531 --> 32:33.460
Sara Lance.

32:33.463 --> 32:34.962
Who's there?

32:34.965 --> 32:36.899
Who are you?

32:36.902 --> 32:39.135
What is this place?

32:39.138 --> 32:40.367
I...

32:40.370 --> 32:42.953
am Mallus.

32:44.828 --> 32:48.070
Soon I will be free,

32:48.073 --> 32:50.373
and your world will know

32:50.376 --> 32:53.218
unendurable pain.

33:03.401 --> 33:04.914
You came back.

33:04.917 --> 33:07.751
It's like you said, you needed me.

33:07.754 --> 33:10.601
Well, your timing is impeccable.

33:10.604 --> 33:13.972
It's a Christmas miracle.

33:13.975 --> 33:15.808
Yes.

33:15.811 --> 33:17.744
Whoo-hoo!

33:21.328 --> 33:23.752
There is nothing physically
ailing you, Captain Lance.

33:23.755 --> 33:25.476
Told you. I'm fine.

33:25.479 --> 33:26.968
You also told me

33:26.971 --> 33:29.046
you visited an alternate dimension.

33:29.049 --> 33:30.849
Well, it wasn't my first time.

33:30.852 --> 33:32.856
Sara...

33:32.858 --> 33:35.359
tell me exactly what you saw in there.

33:35.361 --> 33:37.995
Look, I don't know, okay?
It wasn't about what I saw.

33:37.997 --> 33:41.331
It was about what I... felt.

33:41.333 --> 33:43.033
It was an absence of feeling:

33:43.035 --> 33:46.103
no warmth, no love, just a void,

33:46.105 --> 33:50.707
and the only thing
filling the void was...

33:50.709 --> 33:51.842
Mallus.

33:55.181 --> 33:57.381
It seems Rip was right
to be obsessed with him.

33:57.383 --> 33:58.992
I need to tell the Bureau.

33:58.995 --> 34:00.551
Well, aren't you afraid
of getting in trouble

34:00.553 --> 34:02.786
for disobeying orders?

34:02.788 --> 34:03.954
It was worth it.

34:05.891 --> 34:07.157
See ya again.

34:12.464 --> 34:14.498
Gideon, how's the ol' timeline?

34:14.500 --> 34:17.067
Records show that
history has been restored.

34:17.069 --> 34:19.335
New Valhalla is North America again,

34:19.338 --> 34:21.304
and the only war Beebo has incited

34:21.306 --> 34:23.806
is in shopping malls across the nation.

34:23.809 --> 34:27.077
Sounds like our work here is done.

34:27.079 --> 34:28.445
Gideon, you're sure there are

34:28.447 --> 34:30.112
no other changes to the timeline?

34:30.114 --> 34:32.382
If you're referring to Professor Stein,

34:32.384 --> 34:34.784
he still died in 2017.

34:34.786 --> 34:36.219
I'm sorry, Jax.

34:36.222 --> 34:38.722
Wait... I... I just don't understand.

34:38.724 --> 34:40.623
Uh, the loophole, it...
it should've worked.

34:40.626 --> 34:42.492
That letter told him exactly
how to protect himself

34:42.494 --> 34:44.695
on the day he died. Wh... what happened?

34:44.697 --> 34:47.364
Uh... he... He must not have read it.

34:58.844 --> 35:01.245
Oh! Hey, Lily!

35:01.247 --> 35:04.248
A little birdie told me you
wanted one of these guys.

35:04.250 --> 35:06.183
Beebo! I love him!

35:06.185 --> 35:08.318
Happy Hanukah.

35:08.320 --> 35:10.654
Clarissa, you remember Jefferson.

35:10.656 --> 35:14.091
- You haven't aged a day.
- Neither have you.

35:14.093 --> 35:15.993
Can I get you some Earl Grey?

35:15.995 --> 35:18.829
Uh, yeah, sure.

35:18.831 --> 35:20.195
Come on.

35:20.198 --> 35:21.663
I think I know why you're here.

35:21.666 --> 35:23.299
Come in.

35:26.605 --> 35:28.148
The letter, you never read it.

35:28.151 --> 35:30.173
That's because I already burned it.

35:30.175 --> 35:31.218
What?

35:31.221 --> 35:33.342
I... I was tempted, to be sure.

35:33.345 --> 35:36.513
I thought a lot about that date.

35:36.515 --> 35:39.483
November 28th, 2017.

35:39.485 --> 35:41.618
I'll be 67 then.

35:41.620 --> 35:43.720
I'll have had adventures,

35:43.722 --> 35:46.718
watched my daughter grow up,

35:46.721 --> 35:48.320
and I'll have made a friend,

35:48.323 --> 35:51.261
who was willing to risk
far, far too much for me.

35:51.263 --> 35:54.064
No, I... I am trying to save you...

35:54.066 --> 35:56.667
You need to let me go.

35:56.669 --> 35:59.398
We both know you shouldn't be here.

35:59.401 --> 36:01.204
I... I may have a life ahead of me,

36:01.206 --> 36:03.373
but to you,

36:03.375 --> 36:05.609
- I'm a ghost.
- No, no, to me...

36:05.611 --> 36:09.379
I'm not gonna cheat death, Jefferson.

36:09.381 --> 36:12.182
None of us live forever,

36:12.184 --> 36:13.765
and yet, I clearly live

36:13.768 --> 36:16.720
a wonderful life with many chapters.

36:16.722 --> 36:18.722
And if I had one wish,
it... it wouldn't be for me

36:18.724 --> 36:20.424
to prolong my life.

36:20.426 --> 36:24.070
It... would be for you

36:24.073 --> 36:26.040
to live yours,

36:26.043 --> 36:30.801
and to have all the
happiness you deserve.

36:32.938 --> 36:34.438
Okay.

36:38.410 --> 36:42.212
Goodbye, Grey.

36:42.214 --> 36:44.181
Goodbye, Jefferson.

36:57.971 --> 37:00.046
Did you try to change his fate?

37:01.448 --> 37:03.242
Didn't work, so, uh...

37:04.919 --> 37:06.952
I'm sorry, Jax.

37:06.955 --> 37:08.538
Me too.

37:12.411 --> 37:15.779
If I stay on this ship, I'll
never be able to move on.

37:15.781 --> 37:18.765
What do you mean? Like...

37:18.768 --> 37:20.501
you wanna leave?

37:22.125 --> 37:24.921
You... you can't leave, Jax.

37:24.924 --> 37:27.609
No, you're... you're not leaving.
You're a part of this team.

37:27.612 --> 37:31.161
Yeah, and I always will
be, but right now, uh,

37:31.163 --> 37:33.530
this is something I gotta do.

37:33.532 --> 37:36.333
I need a different kind of adventure.

37:36.335 --> 37:38.402
Is this what you really want?

37:40.172 --> 37:41.671
Yeah.

37:41.673 --> 37:44.441
I would order you to stay,

37:44.443 --> 37:46.276
but I know you'd just disobey me

37:46.278 --> 37:48.945
and follow your heart,
like you always do.

37:48.947 --> 37:51.085
Hey...

37:55.289 --> 37:57.222
Can you do me a favor?

37:57.225 --> 38:00.328
Don't tell the others until I'm gone.

38:00.331 --> 38:03.360
I don't do goodbyes.
It's... it's not my thing.

38:03.362 --> 38:06.820
Yeah, yeah. Totally, I get it.

38:06.823 --> 38:08.198
Okay.

38:37.976 --> 38:40.163
- Surprise!
- Boo!

38:40.166 --> 38:42.298
You didn't really think
we were just gonna let you

38:42.301 --> 38:44.568
sneak out of here
without saying goodbye.

38:44.570 --> 38:46.036
Yeah, we can't celebrate the holidays

38:46.038 --> 38:48.405
without the whole
family. Happy Yuletide.

38:53.081 --> 38:55.545
Well, I think we made an
impressive team out there.

38:55.547 --> 38:57.314
Hm.

38:57.316 --> 38:59.085
Reminded me of old times.

38:59.088 --> 39:01.622
Mm.

39:01.625 --> 39:03.854
L'chaim.

39:05.657 --> 39:07.057
- Mmm.
- As you can taste,

39:07.059 --> 39:08.825
I reprogrammed Gideon.

39:08.827 --> 39:10.794
I should not have tried to change you,

39:10.796 --> 39:14.231
and I'm sorry, Mick.

39:14.233 --> 39:16.366
To the ones we lost,

39:16.368 --> 39:18.117
or left behind.

39:19.388 --> 39:21.471
Speech...

39:21.473 --> 39:22.873
Speech...

39:22.875 --> 39:24.843
- Speech, speech, speech.
- Oh...

39:24.846 --> 39:26.484
Okay, all right.

39:26.487 --> 39:31.046
Uh, when Grey first dragged
me onboard this ship,

39:31.049 --> 39:33.350
uh, I thought it was the last place

39:33.352 --> 39:34.757
that I wanted to be.

39:34.760 --> 39:36.987
I mean, you were all
a bunch of screw-ups,

39:36.989 --> 39:38.398
uh, B-list superheroes,

39:38.401 --> 39:42.024
washed up bank robbers, no offense...

39:42.027 --> 39:43.527
But, uh...

39:43.529 --> 39:45.095
the thing is,

39:45.097 --> 39:46.796
when you get a bunch of broken pieces,

39:46.798 --> 39:49.065
and you put 'em all
together the right way,

39:49.067 --> 39:50.867
they make something new,

39:50.869 --> 39:52.374
and suddenly,

39:52.377 --> 39:54.538
they don't feel so broken anymore...

39:56.375 --> 39:59.176
And I'm pretty sure
that's what a family is.

39:59.178 --> 40:00.554
So, uh...

40:00.557 --> 40:02.312
I don't know what happens next,

40:02.315 --> 40:06.382
but I know I'll always have
a family here with you guys.

40:06.385 --> 40:08.156
- That's right.
- Damn right, little brother.

40:08.159 --> 40:09.553
Always.

40:12.591 --> 40:14.090
Cheers.

40:25.504 --> 40:26.992
Well...

40:26.995 --> 40:29.262
it's been an honor, Captain.

40:31.906 --> 40:33.506
Come here.

40:33.509 --> 40:35.312
Hey...

40:36.682 --> 40:38.515
I'm sure it's only
gonna be a matter of time

40:38.517 --> 40:41.484
before some Aztecs with jetpacks

40:41.486 --> 40:44.054
invade Central City, so...

40:46.191 --> 40:47.991
And the honor's been all mine.

41:16.818 --> 41:20.085
It's been a long time, love.

41:20.088 --> 41:21.458
John?

41:23.929 --> 41:26.312
Now, let's see,

41:26.315 --> 41:28.367
the last time we met,

41:28.370 --> 41:31.138
I saved your soul.

41:31.141 --> 41:33.274
Now there's something you can do for me.

41:33.277 --> 41:35.404
Look, I'd love to help,
but your timing is terrible.

41:35.407 --> 41:37.140
Uh, this won't take long.

41:37.142 --> 41:39.953
You see, there's a demon out there.

41:39.956 --> 41:42.456
It's possessing a little girl.

41:42.459 --> 41:44.526
And that demon,

41:44.529 --> 41:46.195
he knows your name.
