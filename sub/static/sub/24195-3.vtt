WEBVTT

00:05.861 --> 00:07.285
<i>Previously on</i> Billions...

00:07.320 --> 00:08.937
I'm holding in my hand
Robert Axelrod's signature

00:09.039 --> 00:11.206
relinquishing his ability
to trade securities.

00:11.308 --> 00:12.407
He gave it up?

00:12.509 --> 00:15.010
These fuckers can take
away my ability to trade

00:15.112 --> 00:16.745
but not my ability to see.

00:17.198 --> 00:18.746
<i>Taking on the police
fund as a client was</i>

00:18.848 --> 00:20.481
one of the proudest moments of my life.

00:20.583 --> 00:22.817
I knew that if I gave you my
money that you wouldn't sleep

00:22.919 --> 00:24.819
until you put it in
all the right places.

00:24.921 --> 00:27.755
Michael Panay! I know how much you lost.

00:27.857 --> 00:30.758
You're not exactly trending in
the right direction, either.

00:30.860 --> 00:32.491
Maybe we help each other.

00:32.527 --> 00:34.428
It's not the sort of thing
most clients ask for,

00:34.530 --> 00:36.263
especially not when
they're drawing heat.

00:36.365 --> 00:37.498
These are my needs.

00:37.600 --> 00:40.634
Either you meet them or you <i> can't.</i>

00:41.226 --> 00:42.229
We can get it done.

00:42.264 --> 00:45.172
Sometimes a man comes into your life
at just the right time, you know?

00:45.274 --> 00:46.473
Absolutely.

00:47.556 --> 00:49.476
<i>I know that I have
transgressed materially</i>

00:49.578 --> 00:51.911
but, more importantly,
in terms of loyalty.

00:52.014 --> 00:56.449
I'll never talk to you again
once this conversation's over,

00:56.551 --> 00:57.617
which it is.

00:59.000 --> 01:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:19.446 --> 01:21.513
So, I know you figured out what
I have planned for tonight.

01:21.615 --> 01:23.181
I know it's not a surprise.

01:23.284 --> 01:24.182
A girl's intuition.

01:24.285 --> 01:27.084
And a bit of spycraft, but...

01:27.186 --> 01:29.720
Still very excited.

01:30.217 --> 01:32.142
My favorite pasta on the menu.

01:32.177 --> 01:35.616
Tagliatelle with Guffanti
butter from Emilia Romagna.

01:35.651 --> 01:37.494
If you'd like it to
be even more magical,

01:37.596 --> 01:39.163
I recommend white truffles,

01:39.265 --> 01:40.364
$14 a gram.

01:40.466 --> 01:42.166
- No, I'm good.
- Yes, please.

01:42.268 --> 01:43.467
I love truffles.

01:44.109 --> 01:45.869
Ira, you turned me on to them.

01:47.506 --> 01:48.605
No, not now.

01:48.707 --> 01:50.541
Just... just for her, I guess.

01:51.208 --> 01:52.776
Say when.

02:07.892 --> 02:08.791
That's good.

02:08.893 --> 02:10.193
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

02:10.294 --> 02:12.429
20 grams. Biggest portion
of the season. Wow.

02:13.413 --> 02:14.530
Sir, maybe just...

02:14.632 --> 02:17.333
Uh, no, thank you.

02:17.435 --> 02:20.369
Enjoy.

02:23.537 --> 02:27.443
You are... you're great.

02:27.545 --> 02:29.645
Uh, I don't even really understand

02:29.747 --> 02:31.481
how I'm sitting across from you.

02:33.484 --> 02:34.416
Some nights when you're asleep

02:34.518 --> 02:35.717
and light's coming in
through the window,

02:35.819 --> 02:39.554
I just... I... I almost
can't catch my breath

02:39.656 --> 02:41.357
'cause of how beautiful you are.

02:41.459 --> 02:43.025
Even now.

02:43.127 --> 02:45.894
The smoothness of your skin.
Who has skin like that?

02:45.997 --> 02:48.130
You are the sweetest man.

02:49.236 --> 02:54.803
So, all this is why I was planning
to ask you to marry me tonight.

02:54.905 --> 02:56.170
But...

02:56.272 --> 02:58.239
But?

02:58.341 --> 03:00.308
I'm not sure it's fair to you,

03:00.410 --> 03:02.544
with everything that's happened.

03:02.646 --> 03:05.079
Leaving my partnership at the firm,
the company going down,

03:05.181 --> 03:08.182
my entire savings gone. Anyway...

03:08.284 --> 03:10.851
I can't give you the
wedding you deserve,

03:10.953 --> 03:13.287
the honeymoon we discussed,

03:13.390 --> 03:14.788
the life we planned.

03:14.891 --> 03:17.392
I can't tell you to quit your job.

03:17.494 --> 03:20.194
I can't even afford the
ring I picked out for you.

03:21.796 --> 03:23.263
Now, if knowing all this,

03:24.518 --> 03:27.868
you want to go ahead...

03:27.970 --> 03:31.338
No. You're right. We should wait.

03:34.243 --> 03:36.677
Okay. Good.

03:48.057 --> 03:48.955
Oh, my God.

03:49.058 --> 03:50.790
This is delicious.

03:58.099 --> 04:00.399
Now that the papers are signed,

04:00.501 --> 04:03.970
the process can take as
little as four months.

04:04.072 --> 04:07.053
But your case is more
complicated than usual.

04:07.088 --> 04:09.653
Even though you've agreed
to a division of assets,

04:09.688 --> 04:12.028
it'll take a while
before it's finalized.

04:12.063 --> 04:13.579
Thank you, Orrin.

04:27.311 --> 04:29.677
The marriage was broken
down irretrievably.

04:29.779 --> 04:31.512
That's what the document said.

04:31.614 --> 04:32.880
I read it.

04:32.983 --> 04:35.850
Never thought I'd be putting
my signature on that statement.

04:35.953 --> 04:36.684
Me, neither.

04:36.786 --> 04:38.353
No one does.

04:40.857 --> 04:42.741
It happens.

04:43.045 --> 04:45.259
Yeah.

04:48.097 --> 04:49.997
Lar?

04:50.099 --> 04:51.532
The assets.

04:51.634 --> 04:53.901
We need to talk about that.

04:54.003 --> 04:56.604
I know you didn't have to
honor what we've always said,

04:56.706 --> 04:59.106
that we'd split everything 50-50.

04:59.208 --> 05:01.508
You could have fought it. And won.

05:01.610 --> 05:02.943
I appreciate it.

05:03.045 --> 05:05.412
Well, we built it together.

05:05.514 --> 05:08.349
That's not what I'm talking about.

05:08.451 --> 05:10.184
The government. The case.

05:11.301 --> 05:13.753
I'm looking ahead to
what happens if I lose

05:13.856 --> 05:15.155
and they take it all.

05:15.257 --> 05:18.157
I haven't heard you even
entertain that outcome.

05:18.259 --> 05:21.027
Well, I'm at the point now
where I have to.

05:21.129 --> 05:23.429
The Feds traded out the
good judge like they were

05:23.532 --> 05:25.699
doing the cup-and-balls
trick in clear plastic

05:25.801 --> 05:28.259
and flaunting how they
were fucking with me.

05:28.294 --> 05:29.936
But Orrin has said
that the government can

05:30.038 --> 05:32.338
only claw back what they
can prove is ill-gotten.

05:32.440 --> 05:33.840
The prosecutors and the courts,

05:33.942 --> 05:36.509
they're like the mob, worse.

05:36.611 --> 05:40.646
They have methods of accounting
that can taint most of it, all of it.

05:40.748 --> 05:42.448
What do you mean, all of it?

05:42.550 --> 05:43.849
I mean if I take into account

05:43.951 --> 05:46.386
everything that's run
through the banking systems,

05:46.488 --> 05:48.221
everything that's on the radar,

05:48.323 --> 05:52.925
all that's left that I'm
sure can't be touched

05:53.027 --> 05:55.178
is 300 mil,

05:55.213 --> 05:56.629
maybe 320.

05:56.731 --> 05:58.831
Fuck, Bobby.

05:58.933 --> 06:00.666
I...

06:00.768 --> 06:03.002
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but that just...

06:03.103 --> 06:04.737
it doesn't sound like it's enough.

06:04.839 --> 06:05.938
I mean, of course it is.

06:06.040 --> 06:08.507
It's just that the life
that we're used to living...

06:08.608 --> 06:09.841
No, it's not enough.

06:09.943 --> 06:12.044
So when it's done and life starts over,

06:12.146 --> 06:14.746
how long will it take to
build back up from there?

06:14.848 --> 06:16.448
Too fucking long.

06:16.550 --> 06:18.417
So, what?

06:18.519 --> 06:20.752
I have to get more they can't see,

06:20.854 --> 06:23.155
much less touch,

06:23.257 --> 06:25.857
and I have an idea how.

06:39.005 --> 06:40.171
Center mass.

06:40.273 --> 06:43.140
You never pulled your piece
during your time on the job.

06:43.242 --> 06:45.909
Likelihood of that happening
now has got to be far less,

06:46.011 --> 06:48.079
- and yet you practice.
- Got to keep my cert.

06:48.181 --> 06:50.881
I'm not the kind of man to
let hard-earned skills falter.

06:50.983 --> 06:51.882
Neither am I.

06:51.984 --> 06:53.284
It's easier for me, though.

06:53.386 --> 06:55.919
All I have to do is show up here,
aim, and shoot.

06:56.021 --> 06:58.221
You're barred from
practicing what you do.

06:58.323 --> 07:00.356
Well, the investing was only part of it.

07:00.459 --> 07:01.658
There was also the raises.

07:02.441 --> 07:04.427
I loved walking into a room,
knowing there were ten guys

07:04.529 --> 07:07.197
who'd been in front of me,
five waiting for me to leave.

07:07.299 --> 07:10.100
You know my favorite sound in
the world was the one I heard

07:10.202 --> 07:12.769
on the way out,
when those saps in the lobby were told

07:12.871 --> 07:14.437
that their meetings were canceled?

07:14.539 --> 07:15.738
You can't raise, either.

07:15.840 --> 07:17.207
Yeah, well, not at the moment.

07:17.309 --> 07:19.942
But I can advise close friends
on what they ought to do

07:20.044 --> 07:21.877
with money they've been entrusted with.

07:21.980 --> 07:23.546
Let me guess what those funds are.

07:23.648 --> 07:26.047
Things like Ionosphere
or Victor Mateo's?

07:26.082 --> 07:27.409
Those are excellent choices.

07:27.444 --> 07:29.452
I can't do it, Axe.
I can't even think of doing it.

07:29.554 --> 07:32.649
If I know that you're that close
to them, others do, too.

07:32.684 --> 07:34.973
My board of directors
wouldn't allow that.

07:35.008 --> 07:37.511
You got to know if I
got my eye on the money,

07:37.546 --> 07:39.629
that's the best chance it
has to grow for your members.

07:39.731 --> 07:42.231
You can't leave it behind.

07:42.333 --> 07:44.767
I was that way, too,
when I first left the job.

07:44.869 --> 07:46.401
- But then...
- Then what?

07:46.504 --> 07:49.365
You found other interests,
deeper pursuits?

07:49.400 --> 07:51.173
Learned the difference
between Warhol and Peter Max

07:51.275 --> 07:52.874
by spending weekends at the museum?

07:52.976 --> 07:54.943
I grew up in Westbeth, for fuck's sake.

07:55.045 --> 07:57.646
I have always known one was shit,
the other a genius.

07:57.748 --> 08:00.236
But, yes, all that.

08:00.271 --> 08:01.617
Life changed.

08:03.061 --> 08:04.953
Did it solve anything for you?

08:06.099 --> 08:07.722
Did it make the transition easier?

08:08.485 --> 08:09.490
Come on, man.

08:10.725 --> 08:13.424
I saw the look in your eyes when
you had that gun in your hand.

08:13.459 --> 08:14.791
You'll always miss it.

08:14.826 --> 08:17.984
With every breath I draw.
But I had to move on.

08:18.019 --> 08:19.534
As do you.

08:19.636 --> 08:21.969
You knew it was coming. I didn't.

08:23.509 --> 08:25.105
You did your 20. You planned for it.

08:26.210 --> 08:27.978
And you had something
to do with your talents.

08:28.013 --> 08:29.555
You went to B-school at night,

08:29.590 --> 08:31.375
became a trustee of the pension fund.

08:31.410 --> 08:33.414
You became a rich man for
the first time in your life,

08:33.515 --> 08:34.815
but these things don't last.

08:34.917 --> 08:37.284
You know, you have a few down years,
and you could

08:37.385 --> 08:38.818
- get yourself voted out.
- Axe...

08:38.921 --> 08:41.453
Look, what if
I could put you into a fund

08:41.557 --> 08:44.246
where there was no hint
of a connection to me

08:44.280 --> 08:45.631
but was one I could guarantee?

08:45.666 --> 08:49.027
If I could give you the
2.2 Bil to manage, I would.

08:49.062 --> 08:49.763
I can't.

08:50.900 --> 08:52.599
The way that people look
at police these days,

08:52.701 --> 08:55.702
we can't afford even the
whiff of impropriety.

09:10.756 --> 09:11.984
You might want to come
home late tomorrow night.

09:12.087 --> 09:13.186
Huh?

09:14.020 --> 09:16.305
Your father.

09:16.407 --> 09:18.507
I told you he wants to see the kids.

09:18.609 --> 09:21.110
You did, and I told you
I wasn't interested.

09:21.943 --> 09:23.879
Which is why you should
stay late in the office.

09:23.981 --> 09:26.815
Return any and all phone
calls you've been ducking.

09:26.917 --> 09:28.249
I'll text when he's leaving.

09:28.351 --> 09:30.852
I don't duck.
I return all my calls every day.

09:30.955 --> 09:32.955
Do people really do that,
not return calls?

09:33.057 --> 09:34.056
Avoidance usually.

09:34.157 --> 09:37.225
Most people don't want to give bad news
or admit they don't know the answer.

09:37.327 --> 09:39.394
- What answer?
- To whatever the caller wants.

09:39.496 --> 09:41.396
Most people aren't the final authority,
but they don't want

09:41.498 --> 09:43.698
to let on someone else
is making the decisions.

09:43.800 --> 09:45.032
Not me.

09:45.135 --> 09:47.202
No. Not you.

09:47.304 --> 09:51.005
Except about whether my own
father can cross my door frame.

09:52.003 --> 09:54.342
He's a grandfather, too.

09:55.187 --> 09:56.978
And the kids shouldn't
be deprived of him.

09:57.080 --> 09:59.213
- "Can I get back to you?"
- What?

09:59.315 --> 10:02.016
Why don't they just return or
take the call and say that?

10:02.118 --> 10:03.217
"Can I get back to you?"

10:03.319 --> 10:05.452
They can. They don't want to.

10:05.554 --> 10:08.656
Well, I do, and I want to come
home when I want to come home.

10:08.758 --> 10:10.357
I'm trying to keep this light.

10:10.459 --> 10:11.692
I do not want an argument.

10:11.794 --> 10:13.894
But there's reasons I
don't want him here,

10:13.997 --> 10:16.263
and I don't want him seeing you.

10:18.267 --> 10:21.067
Reasons it won't do either
one of us any good to go into,

10:21.170 --> 10:22.802
I promise.

10:22.904 --> 10:24.738
Okay.

10:26.708 --> 10:29.409
I'll bring the kids to him.

10:29.512 --> 10:31.978
Drop them off so they can see him,
and you're clear.

10:32.080 --> 10:33.647
I'll pick them up after.

10:33.749 --> 10:35.548
Okay.

10:48.163 --> 10:50.062
The robots have come.

10:51.866 --> 10:54.400
I got in this racket
a generation too late,

10:54.502 --> 10:55.801
just like Tony Soprano.

10:55.903 --> 10:57.336
Yep, this is how it ends.

10:57.438 --> 10:58.437
Civilization?

10:58.540 --> 11:00.206
Uh-huh. Just like in <i> Tommyknockers.</i>

11:00.308 --> 11:03.042
First it makes things better for you.
Then it destroys you.

11:03.144 --> 11:05.110
This is how computers
take over the world.

11:05.212 --> 11:07.112
<i>Tommyknockers</i> was aliens, not computers.

11:07.214 --> 11:09.081
Yeah, but I have heard about other funds

11:09.183 --> 11:11.449
that bring in quants,
and it doesn't sound good.

11:11.552 --> 11:13.251
Once they get the algo really going...

11:13.353 --> 11:15.220
They get 'em measuring everything we do,

11:15.322 --> 11:16.588
get us competing against it.

11:16.691 --> 11:18.157
Who can beat a fucking computer?

11:18.258 --> 11:20.887
Eventually, the only human left
is the guy feeding the machines.

11:20.928 --> 11:23.662
No computer can get
the kind of info I can

11:23.763 --> 11:25.963
or know what to do with it the way I do,

11:26.066 --> 11:27.131
so buck the fuck up.

11:27.234 --> 11:28.733
No fear!

11:28.835 --> 11:31.102
Bucking. Absolutely.

11:31.205 --> 11:32.470
Fuck fear.

11:32.573 --> 11:33.638
Really?

11:34.562 --> 11:36.641
Nope. Scared shitless.

11:36.743 --> 11:38.409
- Me, too.
- Yeah. I'm totally scared.

11:38.511 --> 11:40.178
Pussies.

11:40.279 --> 11:43.047
I take it you've looked at
the object on the table.

11:43.149 --> 11:44.548
Cardboard?

11:44.650 --> 11:45.616
Yes.

11:45.719 --> 11:47.685
You can see the folds and the tabs.

11:47.787 --> 11:49.153
Fit the pieces into a box,

11:49.255 --> 11:51.956
signal when you're done,
and we'll begin the interview.

12:04.818 --> 12:08.071
I got her ingredients and followed
her recipe and process to the letter.

12:08.173 --> 12:10.476
- You think you nailed it?
- You tell me.

12:10.511 --> 12:13.376
Because it's fucking important
that when Raul bites into this thing,

12:13.478 --> 12:15.478
he is carried away on
sweet reminiscences

12:15.580 --> 12:17.180
of our visit to Ann's Snack Bar

12:17.282 --> 12:19.682
and the Killer Mike <i>R.A.P.
Music</i> release party.

12:29.794 --> 12:31.327
Hmm.

12:32.464 --> 12:33.529
Piss-poor effort, Ryan.

12:34.141 --> 12:35.632
Miss Ann's spinning in
her grave right now,

12:35.734 --> 12:37.094
may she rest in peace.

12:37.129 --> 12:37.900
It's not good?

12:38.741 --> 12:40.169
Her sister told me exactly what to do...

12:40.272 --> 12:41.738
Oh, no, it's good.

12:41.839 --> 12:44.173
But this thing needs
to transport the man.

12:44.275 --> 12:45.707
If you can't fucking do it,

12:45.810 --> 12:47.309
we'll fly her sister up here

12:47.411 --> 12:49.311
with a vat of their
original cooking oil,

12:49.413 --> 12:52.181
even if we have to go down
there and kidnap her ourselves.

12:52.283 --> 12:54.538
Easy, fella. Ryan, keep at it.

12:54.573 --> 12:56.118
This is very close.

12:58.422 --> 12:59.822
What the fuck, Wags?

13:00.899 --> 13:02.500
I've been thinking about your situation.

13:02.535 --> 13:04.493
And I realize it could be
my situation, too.

13:05.235 --> 13:06.234
If this thing cascades

13:06.336 --> 13:07.985
and the government
takes all of your shit,

13:08.005 --> 13:09.537
I'm next.

13:09.639 --> 13:11.739
And then I'll be in the
same boat as you are.

13:11.841 --> 13:13.741
Let's be honest, if that comes to pass,

13:13.843 --> 13:15.743
you'll be in a much
fucking smaller boat.

13:15.845 --> 13:17.278
Don't I know it.

13:25.408 --> 13:26.907
It's actually really good.

13:27.010 --> 13:28.943
I might have overreacted there.

13:29.045 --> 13:31.312
Yeah, so, again, what the fuck?

13:31.414 --> 13:33.047
The quants.

13:33.149 --> 13:34.915
Ahh.

13:35.017 --> 13:36.784
Since 1602,

13:36.886 --> 13:41.221
when the Dutch East India Company
first offered shares to the public,

13:41.323 --> 13:43.190
smart, highly trained mathematicians

13:43.292 --> 13:45.793
have tried, without success,
to solve that market.

13:45.895 --> 13:48.729
And today, Taylor begins the
interviews to hire their own.

13:48.831 --> 13:49.730
<i>Our</i> own.

13:49.832 --> 13:51.365
You know how I feel about that.

13:51.467 --> 13:52.366
I do.

13:52.468 --> 13:54.968
Billy Beane never won a World Series.

13:55.070 --> 13:56.636
This isn't baseball.

13:56.738 --> 13:58.438
Then why didn't you put
quants in place before?

13:58.508 --> 14:00.673
Maybe I just didn't get to it.

14:00.775 --> 14:02.876
Maybe I didn't feel like I needed to.

14:02.978 --> 14:04.244
But Taylor might.

14:04.346 --> 14:06.913
And if they want to do it,
it's your job to help them.

14:07.015 --> 14:09.015
Fine.

14:13.788 --> 14:16.255
Damn.

14:16.357 --> 14:18.858
Apologize to Chef Ryan on your way out.

14:29.070 --> 14:30.269
Sorry to keep calling,

14:30.371 --> 14:32.471
but you know I need to speak
to all the major shareholders,

14:32.573 --> 14:35.508
understand how and when the
company got on Axelrod's radar.

14:35.609 --> 14:37.109
Oh, I love talking about this.

14:37.211 --> 14:38.610
What else is on your pad?

14:38.712 --> 14:42.047
Shall we, uh, relive my divorce
and the day the music died?

14:42.149 --> 14:43.705
I want to put Axelrod away.

14:43.740 --> 14:45.183
I imagine you want the same thing.

14:45.285 --> 14:47.653
I want this done and out of my life.

14:47.755 --> 14:50.155
His conviction sets up my civil suit,

14:50.257 --> 14:52.290
so let's just cut to the...

14:53.071 --> 14:54.120
What happens after this?

14:54.155 --> 14:55.742
You go over what I said with your boss,

14:55.777 --> 14:57.362
decide if you want to
interview me again.

14:57.464 --> 15:00.631
I don't want to drag this out,
and I don't want to get all invested.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.867
I've seen Axelrod wriggle
free plenty of times.

15:02.969 --> 15:04.436
- I'm gonna stop that.
- We'll see.

15:04.538 --> 15:06.104
Let's just do this with your boss.

15:06.206 --> 15:07.605
Okay? You, me, and Dake.

15:07.707 --> 15:10.508
I'll come down to your place
tomorrow or the next day.

15:10.610 --> 15:13.010
One time, with feeling.

15:22.354 --> 15:24.689
You know,
back before Texas was civilized,

15:24.791 --> 15:25.990
if you were a Ranger

15:26.092 --> 15:29.093
and one of your compatriots
fell at the hands of a rustler,

15:29.195 --> 15:32.829
you'd bring that rustler in dead
if you brought him in at all.

15:32.931 --> 15:35.932
Might just make use of
some rope and a tree.

15:36.034 --> 15:37.334
Sure.

15:37.436 --> 15:40.370
And people used to shit outdoors
in the middle of the night

15:40.473 --> 15:42.106
so as not to stink up the house.

15:42.208 --> 15:43.974
And then we found a better way.

15:44.076 --> 15:45.375
I'm not so sure they did.

15:45.478 --> 15:47.644
That walk to the outhouse
in the freezing cold

15:47.746 --> 15:50.046
made a man nut up... literally.

15:50.148 --> 15:52.882
But we ain't talking about
squatting in the dark here, Chuck.

15:52.985 --> 15:53.883
Nossir.

15:53.986 --> 15:55.451
It's probably that rustler stuff

15:55.553 --> 15:58.221
that made you ask me to cancel
my morning and come here.

15:58.323 --> 15:59.222
That it is.

15:59.324 --> 16:01.958
José Lugo. Convicted felon.

16:02.060 --> 16:04.860
Killed a federal prison guard
when his back was turned.

16:04.962 --> 16:08.148
Makes it a federal matter. <i>Our</i> matter.

16:08.183 --> 16:09.765
Sounds like it might.

16:09.867 --> 16:12.282
Might is a New Yorker's word.

16:12.317 --> 16:13.302
I don't want to hear it.

16:13.404 --> 16:15.171
It's a lawyer's word, sir.

16:16.260 --> 16:17.607
I'll need to examine the facts.

16:17.708 --> 16:19.274
Don't condescend to me, Chuck.

16:19.376 --> 16:21.777
We went to the same kind of college,

16:21.879 --> 16:24.513
same damn law school,
clerked in the same offices,

16:24.615 --> 16:29.284
read the same books on ethical justice
by guys like Rawls and Dworkin.

16:29.386 --> 16:32.688
"The suppression of liberty is
likely to always be irrational."

16:33.909 --> 16:36.158
I even bought in to
that crap for a while.

16:36.260 --> 16:38.160
But a man has to grow into who he is,

16:38.262 --> 16:39.494
and who the fuck I am

16:39.596 --> 16:43.031
is a man that's not gonna allow
a prisoner to shank a guard.

16:43.133 --> 16:44.866
And neither are you.

16:44.968 --> 16:47.569
I'll make sure my office looks into it.

16:47.671 --> 16:48.703
Believe it has.

16:48.805 --> 16:50.905
Believe it's dragged
its feet in prosecuting.

16:51.007 --> 16:52.106
Believe that ends now.

16:53.029 --> 16:55.309
Are you picking my cases for me,
General?

16:55.411 --> 16:57.011
Oh, I would never do that.

16:58.387 --> 16:59.714
I'm merely giving you continued guidance

16:59.816 --> 17:01.716
on the types of matters
we are interested

17:01.818 --> 17:04.318
in seeing brought to justice
under the current regime.

17:04.420 --> 17:07.588
I never liked the idea
of a regime in power

17:07.691 --> 17:08.888
in this country.

17:08.991 --> 17:12.259
But you did drop all the cases
that didn't fit the agenda.

17:13.535 --> 17:14.261
I did.

17:14.363 --> 17:18.199
So now you're free to go
after the ones that do.

17:18.300 --> 17:20.467
Thanks for stopping by this morning.

17:22.026 --> 17:24.971
Can I look forward
to seeing you again soon, General?

17:25.074 --> 17:27.040
I love all my children the same, Chuck.

17:28.084 --> 17:31.144
But the Sovereign District of New York
is the first among equals.

17:32.748 --> 17:34.347
Something I learned clerking

17:34.449 --> 17:37.417
for the kind of New York
judge you revere so much is,

17:37.519 --> 17:40.854
you don't let your firstborn
fuck up his Haftarah portion.

18:02.669 --> 18:04.402
I looked in on your candidate.

18:04.505 --> 18:06.627
I know what he's supposed
to be doing with that box.

18:06.674 --> 18:08.373
He's not doing it.

18:08.475 --> 18:10.041
Maybe we move to the verbal portion.

18:10.083 --> 18:11.783
Maybe we just cancel at this point.

18:11.885 --> 18:13.858
- Why would I do that?
- Because you've studied

18:13.887 --> 18:15.683
the Flash Crash of 2010,
and you know that "quant"

18:15.756 --> 18:19.257
is just another word for
"wild fucking guess... with math."

18:19.359 --> 18:22.060
"Quant" is another word for "systemized,
ordered thinking

18:22.162 --> 18:24.562
represented in an algorithmic
approach to trading."

18:24.664 --> 18:25.930
Just remember:

18:26.032 --> 18:29.500
Billy Beane never won a World Series.

18:29.602 --> 18:31.002
If I had a few more minutes...

18:31.104 --> 18:33.036
Forget it. Tell me why you're here.

18:34.507 --> 18:37.475
I combine the human edge
with the quant edge.

18:37.577 --> 18:40.043
My system mimics human peak performance.

18:40.146 --> 18:41.345
Go on.

18:41.447 --> 18:44.248
It's a decision pattern algo
me and my team are developing.

18:44.350 --> 18:45.916
It'll be able to examine data sets

18:46.018 --> 18:48.385
and mirror your own trade
logic in its executions.

18:48.487 --> 18:50.954
At Axe Capital,
we support people from all cultures,

18:51.056 --> 18:53.857
but when you talk to me,
it better be in fucking English.

18:55.861 --> 18:58.595
I can model Taylor's trading patterns.

18:58.697 --> 19:00.030
Reproduce them.

19:00.132 --> 19:01.999
At ten times the speed.

19:02.101 --> 19:03.801
My trading patterns are imperfect.

19:03.903 --> 19:05.268
They're pretty fucking good.

19:05.370 --> 19:08.204
Yes, but I don't want a
pretty fucking good algo.

19:08.307 --> 19:11.107
- That's what I've been saying.
- No, but I start from there.

19:11.209 --> 19:12.709
The way that you would
imitate Taylor's brain

19:12.811 --> 19:15.278
- is by studying it, right?
- Yes, modeling, as I said.

19:15.380 --> 19:17.347
He wants to steal your
fucking brainwaves,

19:17.449 --> 19:19.282
like a witch doctor.

19:20.743 --> 19:22.151
You see that, right?

19:24.222 --> 19:26.655
Yes, actually, I do.

19:26.757 --> 19:28.858
I don't need something
that thinks like me.

19:28.960 --> 19:30.759
I need something that thinks better.

19:30.862 --> 19:32.361
Thanks for coming.

19:43.273 --> 19:46.542
Our master came calling
again with a new assignment.

19:46.644 --> 19:48.444
José Lugo.

19:48.546 --> 19:49.911
That sound familiar?

19:50.013 --> 19:52.948
It does. It's an inmate
who killed a guard.

19:53.050 --> 19:54.950
Mm-hmm.

19:55.052 --> 19:59.321
Uh, it was Connerty's case,
but he did not pursue charges.

20:00.282 --> 20:02.157
We may not have that luxurious option.

20:02.259 --> 20:03.959
Find out why.

20:04.061 --> 20:05.593
On it.

20:12.061 --> 20:15.202
Go for the Recession Special,

20:15.304 --> 20:16.937
even though the recession's over.

20:17.039 --> 20:20.975
You know what? I'm not even sure
which recession they're referring to.

20:21.077 --> 20:22.309
They all end, though.

20:22.412 --> 20:24.144
Yours can, too.

20:24.247 --> 20:27.214
And two dogs and a drink at that price
is a hell of a deal.

20:27.316 --> 20:28.282
You done?

20:28.384 --> 20:30.517
'Cause I'm just getting ready to go.

20:30.619 --> 20:32.953
Civil suit. Reimbursement and damages.

20:33.055 --> 20:35.322
I help EDNY hang a
guilty verdict on you,

20:35.424 --> 20:37.724
and my case is the
Dream Team versus Cuba.

20:37.826 --> 20:40.027
Even if you slither out
of the criminal courts,

20:40.129 --> 20:41.929
I hammer you like the Goldmans did O.J.

20:42.031 --> 20:44.531
Ira, if that felon found
a way not to pay a penny,

20:44.633 --> 20:46.466
what do you think I'm gonna do?

20:46.568 --> 20:49.235
Besides, can you really
afford to wait that long?

20:49.337 --> 20:50.504
Better question,

20:50.606 --> 20:53.573
will that beautiful and
sweet fiancée of yours?

20:53.675 --> 20:56.209
Oh, you're following me,
you sick motherfucker?

20:56.311 --> 20:57.811
What do you want?

20:57.913 --> 21:01.214
Uh, two Recessions,
and what juice are you having?

21:01.316 --> 21:02.782
Oh, too soon?

21:02.884 --> 21:04.984
Couple Cokes.

21:06.521 --> 21:07.954
Bobby, I'm not some sucker

21:08.056 --> 21:11.057
who's just gonna play along with
whatever game you got running.

21:11.159 --> 21:12.992
I'm taking you to court, guns up.

21:13.094 --> 21:14.760
I'm gonna win a fat judgment,

21:14.862 --> 21:17.563
and then, because I got nothing else,
thanks to you,

21:17.665 --> 21:19.865
I'm gonna make it my
sole purpose in life

21:19.967 --> 21:21.801
to stick to you like Lester Hayes

21:21.903 --> 21:25.037
until you've paid it willingly
just to get me to go away.

21:25.139 --> 21:27.606
So you take your hot dogs
and shove 'em up your ass,

21:27.708 --> 21:29.842
lengthwise.

21:29.944 --> 21:31.911
That's not very open-minded of you, Ira.

21:37.617 --> 21:40.352
You should be more open-minded!

21:42.356 --> 21:43.855
<i>I'm not in a full panic.</i>

21:43.958 --> 21:47.492
When I get a full panic going,
I, well...

21:47.594 --> 21:50.094
You can say it, whatever it is, in here.

21:50.196 --> 21:52.497
I... There's things
I'd say to other people

21:52.599 --> 21:53.965
without a second's thought,

21:54.067 --> 21:55.366
but you listen so closely.

21:55.469 --> 21:56.835
That's my job.

21:56.937 --> 21:59.671
But it's like you see
inside the best parts of me,

21:59.773 --> 22:01.372
and it makes me want to be better.

22:01.475 --> 22:04.108
Mafee: what happens when you panic?

22:05.136 --> 22:06.277
Butt sweat.

22:08.047 --> 22:09.280
And now?

22:09.382 --> 22:12.283
Yeah, a little. The whole idea
that we could all be replaced?

22:12.385 --> 22:15.186
If that didn't make your butt sweat,
you wouldn't be human.

22:15.288 --> 22:17.955
Not <i> your</i> butt. I would never
even think about your butt.

22:18.057 --> 22:20.157
It's not like I stare
at it when you walk by.

22:20.259 --> 22:21.692
I barely know you have one.

22:21.794 --> 22:22.759
Jesus.

22:22.862 --> 22:25.743
This quant thing has me all fucked up.

22:25.778 --> 22:28.499
- You think I'm gross now.
- No, I don't. I think you're...

22:28.601 --> 22:30.534
I don't think I can take this.

22:30.636 --> 22:32.703
My mother begged me to code at Stanford,

22:32.805 --> 22:34.437
but I went for Applied Mathematics,

22:34.540 --> 22:37.107
which seemed, you know,
smarter then, but now not only

22:37.209 --> 22:40.110
is she going to be proven right,
but I'm going to be replaced

22:40.212 --> 22:42.012
by people who listened to their mothers

22:42.114 --> 22:43.880
- and learned to code.
- Okay.

22:43.982 --> 22:46.677
You, we, are not being replaced.

22:46.712 --> 22:49.386
Will there be augmentation
of some kind? Yes.

22:49.488 --> 22:52.955
Will it ask you, us,
to raise our game? Yes.

22:53.058 --> 22:55.925
But we have to want that
for this place, don't we?

22:56.995 --> 22:58.861
- No.
- No.

23:00.598 --> 23:01.931
Go.

23:02.033 --> 23:03.566
Express your fears to Taylor.

23:03.668 --> 23:05.167
Let them tell you, Mafee.

23:15.279 --> 23:17.479
<i>Although it's lovely to see you, Bryan,</i>

23:17.581 --> 23:20.849
there was no need to come
in from your Rumspringa.

23:20.951 --> 23:23.452
Much as I dig getting
my Amish on with Dake,

23:23.554 --> 23:26.088
I did have to come. José Lugo.

23:26.190 --> 23:27.889
You can't prosecute this one, Chuck.

23:27.991 --> 23:29.691
I went full Gil Grissom on this case,

23:29.793 --> 23:32.193
and there was no way to
charge the kid with murder.

23:32.295 --> 23:35.063
Body of a prison guard
would indicate otherwise.

23:35.165 --> 23:37.766
Lugo was being held awaiting
charges on a drug offense.

23:37.868 --> 23:39.267
Not the end of the world.

23:39.369 --> 23:40.635
He couldn't make bail,

23:40.737 --> 23:42.637
so they stuck him at MCC for two months.

23:42.739 --> 23:46.474
Day one, this guard started in on Lugo,
and he went beast.

23:46.576 --> 23:49.277
The kid ended up in the
infirmary a dozen times.

23:49.379 --> 23:52.146
Orbital ridge fracture,
teeth, internal bleeding,

23:52.248 --> 23:54.996
splintered wood in the rectum, name it.

23:55.031 --> 23:55.916
You just did.

23:56.018 --> 23:58.719
I've archived 25 prisoner
statements backing it all up.

23:58.821 --> 24:01.189
And what about the other guards?

24:01.291 --> 24:03.290
They refused to go on record.

24:04.334 --> 24:06.159
But that in itself
tells the whole story,

24:06.261 --> 24:07.828
which is this:

24:07.930 --> 24:09.907
José Lugo

24:09.942 --> 24:12.833
is the kind of person
we are here to protect.

24:15.905 --> 24:17.504
I'm asking you: please don't.

24:17.607 --> 24:18.671
Don't do this.

24:18.773 --> 24:21.141
Don't prosecute the case.

24:31.542 --> 24:32.899
Didn't take much legwork

24:33.001 --> 24:36.068
to put Mr. Slayton as one of
your sports-betting clients

24:36.170 --> 24:38.337
who did his part at your behest.

24:38.439 --> 24:40.005
Who were you working for?

24:40.108 --> 24:42.408
We don't take orders. We give 'em.

24:43.711 --> 24:45.777
I see. So, the full weight
of these felonies

24:45.879 --> 24:47.379
should be earmarked for you two?

24:47.482 --> 24:49.582
- And who are you now, sugar pop?
- I'm the one

24:49.683 --> 24:51.183
that's about to pistol-whip you.

24:51.285 --> 24:53.885
Guys, you know how it works.
Name the power behind you.

24:53.988 --> 24:56.588
He's the guy that deserves
to be sitting here, not you.

24:56.690 --> 24:58.590
We have no idea who you're referring to.

25:00.045 --> 25:01.226
Who's paying for him?

25:01.328 --> 25:03.729
- I'm guessing it's the same guy.
- You can't ask that.

25:03.831 --> 25:05.964
You don't think we can
afford a good lawyer?

25:06.066 --> 25:07.132
We own a nightclub.

25:07.234 --> 25:08.766
Nightclub? Your pisshole?

25:08.868 --> 25:10.901
We just got one of
those digital jukeboxes.

25:11.004 --> 25:13.404
Give me Axelrod, the rest goes away.

25:13.507 --> 25:16.441
Anything else,
I drop this whole thing on you.

25:16.543 --> 25:19.644
You become the masterminds
at the head of a conspiracy

25:19.746 --> 25:22.380
seeking to sabotage and
manipulate companies

25:22.482 --> 25:23.748
and financial markets.

25:23.850 --> 25:25.382
We're masterminds.

25:25.484 --> 25:27.384
Masterminds is good. I like masterminds.

25:27.486 --> 25:28.953
Put us down for masterminds.

25:29.055 --> 25:31.522
Gentlemen, I suggest
we have a private conversation.

25:31.624 --> 25:34.792
You know, that's a good idea, boys.
Go talk amongst yourselves.

25:34.894 --> 25:37.238
You Inwood types never could
learn to shut your mouths.

25:37.596 --> 25:38.382
Sorry?

25:38.432 --> 25:40.965
Oh, we used to drove over from
Fordham and roll your kind

25:41.067 --> 25:42.266
just 'cause it was easy pickings.

25:42.368 --> 25:44.234
That's funny.
We used to ride over to the Bronx

25:44.336 --> 25:46.670
and beat the shit out of Fordham
fruits for morning exercise.

25:46.772 --> 25:47.837
Can't believe we missed you.

25:47.939 --> 25:49.406
Must have been hiding in the corner.

25:49.508 --> 25:50.865
I'm gonna ask that
this conversation stop.

25:50.977 --> 25:53.810
Why don't you stop?
Let the men finish talking.

25:53.912 --> 25:56.476
Are you two sawed-off
pricks including yourselves

25:56.482 --> 25:59.015
in that category?

25:59.117 --> 26:01.484
You don't have shit on
us but some dink's word.

26:01.586 --> 26:04.187
You had more than that,
this wouldn't be a conversation.

26:04.289 --> 26:07.356
So if you got the sack, make your move.

26:07.458 --> 26:09.926
Otherwise, we got kegs to change.

26:11.997 --> 26:14.997
Next time I see you boys,
I'll watch 'em slap the cuffs on.

26:15.099 --> 26:17.266
Then I guess we won't
be seeing each other.

26:42.193 --> 26:45.493
I used to love visiting
museums when I was a young man,

26:45.596 --> 26:47.795
back before I could
afford the paintings.

26:47.897 --> 26:52.567
Now I'd rather look at 'em on my walls.

26:52.669 --> 26:54.736
I'm selling all my shit.

26:54.838 --> 26:56.804
You were right at the car auction.

26:56.906 --> 26:58.172
I am barely hanging on.

26:58.275 --> 27:00.775
Redemptions are starting
to hit in a big way.

27:01.483 --> 27:03.278
It doesn't matter anyway.

27:03.380 --> 27:05.780
I never knew what was any
good about my collection.

27:05.882 --> 27:08.049
I just bought what the
art advisor told me to.

27:08.151 --> 27:10.017
That's one way to go.

27:10.120 --> 27:12.053
I can't imagine what I sound like.

27:13.587 --> 27:16.657
You sound like a guy who's
had a rough couple of years.

27:16.760 --> 27:18.659
Happens to everyone.

27:18.762 --> 27:21.027
I'll have to shutter soon.

27:22.252 --> 27:23.697
What are you walking with?

27:23.799 --> 27:27.601
40.

27:27.703 --> 27:29.303
I guess I can live on that.

27:30.809 --> 27:33.974
Can you?

27:34.076 --> 27:35.709
Got the city apartment,

27:35.811 --> 27:38.278
the Hamptons place, Beaver Creek.

27:38.380 --> 27:42.382
The debt service and running
the properties is ten a year.

27:42.484 --> 27:45.786
You'll have to start
your new family office.

27:45.888 --> 27:47.553
There's a lease, an analyst or two,

27:47.656 --> 27:48.955
an assistant, an accountant.

27:49.057 --> 27:50.857
You got private school,

27:50.959 --> 27:52.859
your daughter's horse, you got charity.

27:52.961 --> 27:54.894
You can't dip below two a year on that,

27:54.996 --> 27:58.264
or you lose your board seats
and your wife loses all her friends.

27:58.366 --> 28:00.533
You can forget flying
wheels up from now on.

28:00.635 --> 28:02.435
You're sucking it up in commercial.

28:02.537 --> 28:05.938
You'll hold on to your driver
until it kills you, but...

28:06.040 --> 28:07.206
soon, he'll be gone, too.

28:07.309 --> 28:09.309
Fuck! I'm broke.

28:12.646 --> 28:14.947
What would you give to get it back?

28:15.049 --> 28:19.618
Your status, all your money,
the whole thing.

28:19.720 --> 28:21.020
Anything.

28:21.122 --> 28:25.057
My leg. My spleen. An inch off my dick.

28:25.159 --> 28:27.793
Well, then this is the
best day of your new life,

28:27.894 --> 28:30.329
'cause I got a line on
an orphaned two billion

28:30.431 --> 28:31.563
looking for a home,

28:31.665 --> 28:33.965
and I can get you in the
room to pitch for it.

28:34.067 --> 28:37.068
All you have to do is say yes.

28:43.027 --> 28:43.841
Got a minute?

28:46.578 --> 28:48.645
Roughly two minutes.

28:49.685 --> 28:51.448
The quants, why?

28:51.550 --> 28:53.750
Why now? What if we didn't?

28:53.853 --> 28:55.319
What if we kept things the same?

28:55.420 --> 28:57.420
Think of the Pulaski Academy Bruins,
Mafee.

28:57.522 --> 28:58.688
You read me?

28:58.790 --> 29:00.991
The high school football
team that never punts?

29:01.093 --> 29:03.360
Right. They were pretty solid before,

29:03.462 --> 29:04.861
so why'd they do that?

29:04.963 --> 29:07.564
Because the coach deduced that,
statistically,

29:07.666 --> 29:10.132
they'd be better off using
all four downs on offense

29:10.235 --> 29:11.601
and not giving the ball back.

29:11.703 --> 29:14.537
Yes. And because the coach
wanted championships.

29:14.639 --> 29:16.439
- So it's about edge.
- Always.

29:16.541 --> 29:19.308
ETFs. They sucked the dumb
money out of the market.

29:19.410 --> 29:21.277
Trillions have poured into them.

29:21.379 --> 29:23.246
That was our edge, and our edge is gone.

29:23.348 --> 29:24.413
When I look around now,

29:24.515 --> 29:26.615
it's only other killers
like us staring back.

29:26.717 --> 29:28.617
But there are a bunch of quants
already out there on the market,

29:28.719 --> 29:29.919
already working that edge.

29:30.021 --> 29:32.421
That's why ours has to be better.

29:32.523 --> 29:34.790
Okay. Okay.

29:34.892 --> 29:37.393
Look, people down on the
floor thought this was about

29:37.495 --> 29:39.361
wholesale firing and replacement.

29:39.463 --> 29:40.863
So I see the wisdom in adding.

29:40.964 --> 29:44.099
But otherwise, are we good?

29:46.169 --> 29:48.737
I don't know. Are we? Are you?

29:48.839 --> 29:52.207
Are you running all four downs,
playing every play like it's your last?

29:52.309 --> 29:54.209
Is your mouth guard always in,
chin strap always buckled?

29:54.311 --> 29:56.009
If that's you, we're good.

30:12.161 --> 30:13.994
Please describe the nature of
your approach to the market

30:14.096 --> 30:15.996
and how your algorithms serve that end.

30:16.098 --> 30:17.432
Boring.

30:17.534 --> 30:19.467
What the fuck kind of way is
that to kick off an interview?

30:19.569 --> 30:21.969
I'm rejecting the premise
or flipping the script.

30:22.071 --> 30:23.638
<i>I</i> should interview <i> you.</i>

30:23.740 --> 30:25.639
For what, the school newspaper?

30:26.013 --> 30:28.508
Yassss, Queen. Good one, but no.

30:28.610 --> 30:30.411
I've got offers from half
the funds on the Street

30:30.512 --> 30:32.012
and several tech firms out West,

30:32.114 --> 30:33.814
and they pay guarantees, not bonuses.

30:33.916 --> 30:36.516
Now, don't get me wrong.
I've heard about Taylor Mason.

30:36.618 --> 30:39.519
Love to see if you live up to the hype,
but I've got options.

30:39.621 --> 30:41.755
So, let me put this in your language:

30:43.759 --> 30:45.425
What's in it for <i> moi?</i>

30:45.527 --> 30:48.695
You Patrick Bateman/Bud Fox
hybrid wannabe.

30:48.797 --> 30:50.464
He was doing Spader in <i> Wall Street.</i>

30:50.566 --> 30:53.266
But I don't care about
his insulting tone.

30:53.368 --> 30:54.634
I only care about his ability

30:54.736 --> 30:56.302
to think clearly and
rationally under pressure.

30:56.404 --> 30:57.971
You're not thinking of hiring him?

30:58.073 --> 31:00.073
She's no fool.

31:00.175 --> 31:01.540
No.

31:01.642 --> 31:03.709
But, sadly,
though you may have a genius-level I.Q.,

31:03.811 --> 31:05.979
you have no control over
your emotional state.

31:06.081 --> 31:07.913
That's why you're lashing out in here,

31:08.016 --> 31:10.116
defensive,
allowing your rage at yourself

31:10.218 --> 31:12.518
to manifest in boorish,
childish behavior.

31:12.620 --> 31:15.320
He couldn't figure out the box,
so he did that to it.

31:15.422 --> 31:18.090
Then he let the rest of his
bullshit cloud his thinking.

31:18.192 --> 31:20.593
He has no idea why he had
to resort to brute force,

31:20.695 --> 31:22.094
so he doesn't get to work here.

31:23.527 --> 31:25.129
Take your feet off the table

31:25.164 --> 31:27.633
and get the fuck out of our office.

31:31.905 --> 31:33.771
So, are we done with this now?

31:33.874 --> 31:34.906
No.

31:35.009 --> 31:37.376
Let me remind you. August 2007.

31:37.478 --> 31:39.978
The Dow crashed 400 points
because of a coding error.

31:40.080 --> 31:41.946
That was more than ten years ago, which,

31:42.049 --> 31:44.749
even with the breakdown
in Moore's Law, is more like 100.

31:44.851 --> 31:46.118
Feels like yesterday to me.

31:46.220 --> 31:49.821
We need to be thinking about tomorrow.
So we keep going.

31:53.927 --> 31:56.828
Warden, I need you to say
that if the guard were alive,

31:56.930 --> 31:58.429
you'd fire him for abuse

31:58.532 --> 32:00.297
and that the kid is innocent.

32:00.400 --> 32:02.667
My hands are clean,
my conscience clean enough.

32:02.769 --> 32:04.468
I'm not gonna take you off the hook

32:04.570 --> 32:06.103
and hang myself there instead.

32:06.205 --> 32:09.673
Well, I didn't devote my life to the law
to prosecute innocent men.

32:09.775 --> 32:11.708
Nor I to oversee their incarceration,

32:11.810 --> 32:13.511
but once they send them to me...

32:13.612 --> 32:15.946
Yep, you do your level best.

32:16.049 --> 32:20.450
Currently, there are 400 cases
filed against you by inmates,

32:20.553 --> 32:24.385
which could suggest your level best
isn't very good.

32:24.420 --> 32:26.150
Almost all of them pro forma.

32:26.185 --> 32:27.991
Their beds are too hard.
Their food sucks.

32:28.093 --> 32:29.593
I get it.

32:29.695 --> 32:33.931
The cases are filed against you
in your official capacity as warden

32:35.244 --> 32:37.067
and, therefore, defended by me

32:37.169 --> 32:40.136
in my official capacity
as U.S. Attorney.

32:41.015 --> 32:43.092
And you're gonna throw
them if I don't play ball?

32:43.127 --> 32:44.866
I wouldn't even know
how to throw a case,

32:44.901 --> 32:46.342
how to lose on purpose.

32:46.445 --> 32:49.546
Normally, I would knock
these nuisances away

32:49.647 --> 32:52.782
like a windshield wiper
during a light rain.

32:52.884 --> 32:56.151
But what if I just... slowed down...

32:56.253 --> 32:57.987
let 'em build up...

32:58.089 --> 33:00.189
cloud your field of vision,

33:00.291 --> 33:03.425
the drops becoming a deluge.

33:04.828 --> 33:08.464
But if I say the kid was tortured
and it was the guard's fault...

33:08.566 --> 33:11.933
Then I fight those cases off
as if they were against me personally.

33:12.035 --> 33:14.303
- You can't think I'd testify.
- No.

33:15.944 --> 33:17.973
No. There's a young journalist I know.

33:18.075 --> 33:19.808
He'll take your testimony.

33:19.910 --> 33:23.312
Stalwart, ambitious fellow
branching out from finance

33:23.414 --> 33:25.714
into what we might call national news.

33:25.816 --> 33:27.015
He can protect your name

33:27.117 --> 33:30.719
if you give him enough corroboration
to make his story undeniable.

33:30.821 --> 33:32.654
Thank you, Warden.

33:32.756 --> 33:35.624
Happy to do the right thing.

33:44.860 --> 33:46.554
How'd you know not to bet me?

33:46.656 --> 33:48.455
Win, lose 100, who gives a shit?

33:48.558 --> 33:50.223
You have more money than god.

33:50.325 --> 33:52.760
I didn't get it by wagering
against Willie Mosconi.

33:52.862 --> 33:54.094
You were gonna sandbag me.

33:54.196 --> 33:55.763
Let me win a few games,

33:55.865 --> 33:58.566
then double the bet, then run me down.

33:58.668 --> 34:00.233
I didn't even bring my own cue.

34:00.335 --> 34:02.402
If you had, maybe I'd have gone for it,

34:02.504 --> 34:06.073
counting on that special vanity
that a man with a custom cue has.

34:06.175 --> 34:08.308
Once you started chalking up, no chance.

34:10.045 --> 34:13.213
Oh.

34:13.315 --> 34:14.547
Thanks, Chef Ryan.

34:16.350 --> 34:17.684
Mm.

34:17.786 --> 34:20.085
Last time I had a burger this good...

34:20.188 --> 34:23.389
Remember that time down in Atlanta,
with Killer Mike?

34:26.478 --> 34:30.862
That was right before I gave Axe Capital
that extra half-billion from my fund.

34:33.547 --> 34:35.000
Good anchoring technique.

34:35.103 --> 34:36.534
No.

34:36.637 --> 34:38.404
But no matter how tasty, I'm not sure

34:38.505 --> 34:40.706
I can give the same
treatment to Michael Panay.

34:40.808 --> 34:44.577
There is no linkage to me,
so that solves the first problem.

34:45.712 --> 34:48.514
But he will listen to me
and invest exactly as I instruct,

34:48.616 --> 34:50.315
so that solves problem two.

34:50.417 --> 34:53.150
Yeah, but he's on a bad run, Axe.
He's bleeding out.

34:53.253 --> 34:54.820
But you got a surgeon stepping in.

34:54.922 --> 34:56.387
I know that, but my board can't.

34:56.489 --> 34:58.156
I got to hard-sell this guy to them.

34:58.258 --> 34:59.758
Well, get Panay to convince them.

34:59.860 --> 35:01.259
Get him in front of that board.

35:01.361 --> 35:03.829
You sure?
It's hard to defend numbers like his.

35:03.931 --> 35:05.930
He's presentable.

35:06.032 --> 35:09.000
Let's get him in here and see. Panay!

35:09.102 --> 35:12.870
Looks like I'm not the
only sandbagger in here.

35:12.972 --> 35:14.272
Mike,

35:14.374 --> 35:15.607
this is Raul.

35:15.708 --> 35:18.109
- He's gonna take you in.
- Not unless you can tell me

35:18.211 --> 35:19.977
why you ran your fund into the ground.

35:20.079 --> 35:21.379
They'll expect some answers.

35:21.481 --> 35:22.813
He'll have answers.

35:22.915 --> 35:25.582
Just show strength and pitch
them your best three ideas,

35:25.685 --> 35:26.617
which I'll give you.

35:26.719 --> 35:28.385
And if anybody steps in your face...

35:28.487 --> 35:30.254
Kick 'em in the cock.

35:30.982 --> 35:31.789
Okay.

35:31.891 --> 35:33.824
I'll wear sharp shoes.

35:35.079 --> 35:35.793
All right.

35:35.895 --> 35:38.162
I'll let you know when
we've booked a meeting.

35:46.338 --> 35:48.472
So?

35:48.574 --> 35:49.906
I might be able to sell him.

35:50.008 --> 35:52.576
But why would I?

36:06.621 --> 36:08.210
_

36:14.186 --> 36:16.465
I must be out of my fucking mind.

36:18.469 --> 36:19.868
Oh, I disagree.

36:20.479 --> 36:22.672
I think you're showing some
real nuance in your thinking,

36:22.773 --> 36:25.074
which is what is required
since you have suffered

36:25.176 --> 36:27.176
at the hands of some
very devious opponents

36:27.278 --> 36:28.476
in Rhoades and his father.

36:28.579 --> 36:30.779
Yeah, well, I'm here
for some goddamned reason,

36:30.881 --> 36:33.682
so, uh, what is it you want to propose?

36:36.087 --> 36:39.621
That I acquire your virtually
worthless shares in Ice Juice

36:39.724 --> 36:42.457
for considerably over market.

36:42.559 --> 36:44.193
30 million dollars.

36:44.294 --> 36:47.028
A firm called Ionosphere
would paper the transaction.

36:47.130 --> 36:50.031
In return, you forgo your civil suit

36:50.133 --> 36:52.367
and refuse to testify against me.

36:52.469 --> 36:58.573
You'll give my people a statement
laying out how Rhoades did what he did.

37:00.143 --> 37:03.510
Your best friend sold you
down the river for nothing.

37:03.613 --> 37:05.813
He's not worth saving.

37:05.915 --> 37:08.482
I'm willing to pay you 30
million to tell the truth.

37:08.584 --> 37:12.453
It's just a transaction to you,
this whole thing?

37:12.555 --> 37:14.122
Numbers move from here to there,

37:14.224 --> 37:17.625
and emotions are smoothed out,

37:17.727 --> 37:19.092
like ice under a Zamboni.

37:19.194 --> 37:21.362
No, I understand what's fair.

37:21.464 --> 37:24.030
And I know how to make a deal.

37:24.133 --> 37:27.334
So, take your life back.

37:37.445 --> 37:39.445
Gary?

37:48.891 --> 37:52.057
While you're at it,
go ahead and pick one.

37:53.637 --> 37:54.494
On my tab.

37:55.043 --> 37:56.663
Why should she have to suffer?

38:11.417 --> 38:12.907
How does it work? What am I missing?

38:13.009 --> 38:14.243
We'll get back to that.

38:14.345 --> 38:16.926
Résumé says you were at NASA,
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

38:17.014 --> 38:20.415
20 years. The most rewarding job
a data scientist could ask for.

38:20.517 --> 38:23.252
And now finance. Why?

38:23.354 --> 38:26.855
The stock market is representation
of the psychology of the entire world

38:26.957 --> 38:28.223
at any given moment.

38:28.324 --> 38:30.488
Data is an exact
thumbprint of that moment.

38:30.561 --> 38:33.828
I get to know what the world
is thinking and feeling

38:33.930 --> 38:35.096
and what it will do next.

38:35.198 --> 38:38.432
What a refreshing, excellent answer.

38:38.534 --> 38:39.533
Yes.

38:39.636 --> 38:41.068
Would you be willing to let me test it

38:41.170 --> 38:42.770
so I can observe it
under market conditions?

38:42.872 --> 38:44.371
Of course.
I'll give you access for the day,

38:44.440 --> 38:46.939
and you'll be able to see how it works.

38:48.277 --> 38:49.942
It doesn't fit together, right?

38:50.044 --> 38:52.044
You're testing the
ability to realize that,

38:52.147 --> 38:53.513
the confidence to admit it?

38:53.615 --> 38:55.114
Outstanding.

39:01.523 --> 39:03.156
Connerty called.

39:03.258 --> 39:04.157
He saw the article.

39:04.259 --> 39:05.858
A lot of people have seen it.

39:05.960 --> 39:08.261
They found a good photo of the kid.

39:08.362 --> 39:10.196
Looks innocent, no?

39:10.298 --> 39:12.165
Handsome, for sure.

39:12.267 --> 39:13.699
Even better.

39:13.802 --> 39:16.302
Can't make us proceed now.

39:16.404 --> 39:19.205
If you had been forced to prosecute,

39:19.307 --> 39:21.039
could you have?

39:23.411 --> 39:25.744
Honestly, I don't know
that I have it in me.

39:26.938 --> 39:29.080
Glad we won't have to find out.

39:30.733 --> 39:32.250
<i>Well, now that we're all here...</i>

39:32.353 --> 39:36.621
As you both know, I had a large
ownership stake in Ice Juice.

39:36.723 --> 39:38.990
It was to be worth a
great deal at one point.

39:39.092 --> 39:41.259
Turned out to be worth
substantially less.

39:41.361 --> 39:43.594
Thanks to Axelrod's involvement.

39:45.665 --> 39:50.617
Uh, I can't and won't speak to
the actions of Bobby Axelrod.

39:50.786 --> 39:52.304
- What?
- Hold on.

39:52.405 --> 39:54.605
'Cause I don't actually
know what he did.

39:54.708 --> 39:57.942
But I sure as hell will testify
about what Chuck Rhoades did.

39:59.439 --> 40:00.378
Which is?

40:00.480 --> 40:03.481
Purposefully induce
sabotage against my company,

40:03.583 --> 40:07.485
use his status and position to
lure Bobby Axelrod to do it.

40:07.587 --> 40:09.753
And I will confirm, on the record,

40:09.856 --> 40:13.490
that Charles Rhoades Sr.
was steering his own money

40:13.592 --> 40:15.826
and that Chuck's money
was directly involved...

40:15.928 --> 40:17.461
Stop.

40:17.563 --> 40:19.629
Mr. Schirmer,
you need to speak with counsel

40:19.732 --> 40:20.898
before going any further.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.800
We all need to hold and
contemplate the risks

40:23.903 --> 40:25.239
these allegations pose to our case.

40:25.304 --> 40:27.738
Dake! Oliver. We need to hear him out.

40:27.840 --> 40:29.840
This meeting is over.

40:32.711 --> 40:34.878
Yeah, I sort of figured.

40:38.950 --> 40:40.083
Why'd you let him go?

40:40.185 --> 40:41.785
We need to know what he had to say.

40:41.887 --> 40:43.786
He said Chuck induced the sabotage.

40:43.889 --> 40:46.256
We need to know what that means!
Why the fuck...

40:46.358 --> 40:49.292
'Cause I know how to do my job,
and the job is Axelrod.

40:49.394 --> 40:50.593
If Chuck is part of it,

40:50.695 --> 40:53.029
it's prosecutorial misconduct,
at a minimum.

40:53.131 --> 40:54.364
Is it?

40:54.465 --> 40:55.831
At this moment, we don't know,

40:55.934 --> 40:58.501
And we don't want to know.
Because if you keep asking,

40:58.603 --> 41:00.403
you run the risk of a Brady disclosure.

41:00.505 --> 41:03.406
The more he says about whatever
story he's put together,

41:03.508 --> 41:07.142
the more likely we'll be obligated
to inform the defense of our findings.

41:07.244 --> 41:10.413
And what do you think
they will do with that,

41:10.515 --> 41:13.148
other than blow up
everything that we have?

41:13.250 --> 41:16.618
We are in the right and wrong game,
and this is...

41:16.720 --> 41:20.289
Today we're in the
"take the win and move on" game.

41:20.391 --> 41:24.659
Is that what being a boss does to you?

41:24.761 --> 41:27.329
Like when Sonny Black
gets upped in <i> Brasco?</i>

41:29.400 --> 41:34.168
I was brought to Eastern
for one specific task:

41:34.270 --> 41:37.238
to convict Bobby Axelrod.

41:37.340 --> 41:39.841
You were brought to
Eastern for the same task

41:39.943 --> 41:42.811
by the very person that you
are now trying to jam up,

41:42.913 --> 41:46.147
a man who was a mentor to you.

41:46.249 --> 41:50.117
That's disloyal,
and I don't cotton to that.

41:51.216 --> 41:53.020
So if you can't do it,

41:53.122 --> 41:55.456
I'll find someone who can.

41:55.558 --> 41:57.425
That's all.

42:28.323 --> 42:31.157
I told you I'd see 'em
slip the cuffs on.

42:33.060 --> 42:34.294
No one here but you and me.

42:35.042 --> 42:37.897
I guess this is your chance, bitch.

42:37.999 --> 42:39.064
Ugh!

42:44.038 --> 42:46.338
Hey! Johnny, you all right?

42:46.440 --> 42:49.041
Let's go, douchebags!
We got warrants.

42:49.143 --> 42:51.243
Hook 'em both up. Parole violations.

42:51.345 --> 42:53.212
- Come on, asshole.
- What the fuck?

42:53.314 --> 42:54.913
This guy just assaulted my brother.

42:55.016 --> 42:57.216
- We didn't see nothing.
- Of course you didn't.

42:57.318 --> 42:59.485
- Come on. Let's go.
- Ah, you suckered me.

42:59.586 --> 43:01.186
Nah, you were born that way.

43:03.424 --> 43:05.057
All right. Get in. Watch your head.

43:12.032 --> 43:13.598
I'm glad you stayed.

43:13.700 --> 43:15.934
I don't remember having had a choice.

43:16.036 --> 43:18.202
You can take these with you when you go.

43:18.304 --> 43:19.337
What are they?

43:19.439 --> 43:20.705
Chuck's.

43:20.807 --> 43:25.877
I've been cleaning out a walk-in closet
to have a humidor built.

43:25.979 --> 43:29.647
Memorabilia for all his
achievements from growing up.

43:29.749 --> 43:32.150
Seemed very important to him back then.

43:32.252 --> 43:33.584
To him, not you?

43:33.686 --> 43:35.119
Why would I ever give a shit

43:35.221 --> 43:38.089
about his third-place squash
trophy from prep school?

43:38.191 --> 43:41.325
If he'd won,
maybe I'd put it on the mantel.

43:41.428 --> 43:43.794
Charles...

43:43.896 --> 43:48.032
I can see what all this is doing to you.

43:48.133 --> 43:50.000
Why don't you reach out, talk to him?

43:51.094 --> 43:53.070
What if I seeded the ground?

43:53.172 --> 43:55.606
Ensured you wouldn't be rebuffed?

43:56.676 --> 43:58.508
I'm the aggrieved party here.

43:59.065 --> 44:01.010
If there's any reaching out to be done,

44:01.113 --> 44:03.213
it should be from the other side.

44:04.207 --> 44:05.482
You don't know what your husband did.

44:05.584 --> 44:06.649
You mean use your money

44:06.751 --> 44:08.751
to bait Axe into
committing a federal crime

44:08.853 --> 44:11.821
and wipe out his own
trust in the process?

44:11.923 --> 44:13.557
He told you.

44:13.658 --> 44:15.692
Your son is the man you made him.

44:16.466 --> 44:19.662
Whatever greatness and whatever darkness
is in him came from you.

44:23.468 --> 44:25.434
Clear this shit out of here.

44:27.505 --> 44:28.871
I'm sorry. It'll have to wait.

44:28.974 --> 44:31.207
I drove the Maserati tonight.
It won't fit.

44:34.078 --> 44:35.877
Come on, kids.

44:39.049 --> 44:40.816
Okay. Let's talk deal.

44:40.918 --> 44:44.920
It's been a pleasure,
but this isn't going to work out.

44:45.022 --> 44:46.989
But the algo performed beautifully.

44:47.091 --> 44:49.158
Yeah, his algo performed beautifully.

44:49.260 --> 44:51.493
You know I'm no fan,
but even I can see...

44:51.595 --> 44:52.961
I could go into specifics,

44:53.063 --> 44:55.097
but it's just not what
we're looking for.

44:55.198 --> 44:56.598
The NDAs have all been signed,

44:56.700 --> 44:59.200
and your model expired
at the close today, so...

44:59.302 --> 45:00.702
I wish you well.

45:08.411 --> 45:09.577
I spotted the back door he put in,

45:09.679 --> 45:12.480
the one that would allow us to
support our plays retroactively

45:12.582 --> 45:13.881
with legit-seeming data.

45:13.983 --> 45:15.049
Really?

45:15.152 --> 45:17.185
And I know that you
somehow organized it.

45:17.287 --> 45:19.521
Is that how desperate
you are to avoid quants?

45:19.623 --> 45:21.656
That you try to rig it to blunt them

45:21.758 --> 45:23.290
and try to float it past
me without telling me?

45:23.392 --> 45:25.459
Of course not. I...

45:27.463 --> 45:28.663
All right, how'd you know?

45:28.765 --> 45:30.765
Your body language,
the softball questions,

45:30.867 --> 45:32.133
the register of your voice.

45:32.234 --> 45:34.769
But the only thing I
can't figure out is why.

45:34.871 --> 45:36.671
Do you know how Axe and I met,

45:36.773 --> 45:39.306
what the source of my
loyalty to that man is?

45:40.176 --> 45:41.808
I don't.

45:41.910 --> 45:44.911
Well, I was at Lehman the last
time a bunch of brilliant kids

45:45.013 --> 45:47.447
thought that they had solved the
fucking secrets of the market.

45:47.550 --> 45:49.316
It almost cost me
everything that I had built

45:49.418 --> 45:50.417
over my entire career.

45:50.519 --> 45:52.653
The rest of us, we were at their mercy

45:52.754 --> 45:55.455
because we didn't understand
what they were doing,

45:55.558 --> 45:56.990
so we couldn't question it.

45:57.092 --> 45:59.525
It was a chance meeting
with Axe at a golf outing

45:59.627 --> 46:02.696
wherein he read my tarot cards for me,

46:02.798 --> 46:04.530
told me what was gonna happen.

46:04.632 --> 46:05.865
I was able to sell at 50.

46:05.967 --> 46:07.801
If I had waited a few more months,

46:07.903 --> 46:09.169
it would have been at two.

46:10.628 --> 46:15.140
Axe's warning allowed me to save my ass
before it was too late.

46:15.243 --> 46:17.276
I do not want to be in that position

46:17.378 --> 46:19.212
ever again.

46:19.314 --> 46:20.746
I see.

46:20.848 --> 46:23.249
Even though your former
company was levered 31 times

46:23.351 --> 46:24.783
and there were countless
other factors at play,

46:25.932 --> 46:28.187
I get how traumatic that was.

46:28.289 --> 46:30.189
So you're not gonna hire a quant?

46:31.031 --> 46:32.586
I am not going to hire a quant.

46:32.621 --> 46:33.558
That's become clear to me.

46:36.646 --> 46:37.521
And you're correct.

46:37.556 --> 46:39.278
Billy Beane never won a World Series.

46:39.313 --> 46:41.266
But Theo Epstein did,
using all the same strategies

46:41.368 --> 46:43.635
Billy came up with first,
and we will, too.

46:43.738 --> 46:45.704
I accept I can't go outside
to find what we need,

46:45.805 --> 46:47.606
so we're going to build our own.

46:47.708 --> 46:49.207
I'm going to oversee it.

46:57.848 --> 46:58.606
He did it.

46:58.708 --> 47:00.975
He damn near actually
kicked the guy in the cock.

47:01.077 --> 47:02.576
Only it was a woman board member.

47:02.678 --> 47:04.278
They ate him up.

47:04.380 --> 47:05.923
I'm just so happy for the
both of you it worked out.

47:06.016 --> 47:08.449
Axe, I am just so grateful.

47:08.551 --> 47:12.286
You gave me back my world.

47:20.029 --> 47:21.128
Hey, hey!

47:21.229 --> 47:23.229
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey.

47:23.331 --> 47:25.231
How are you, sweetheart?
Good to see you.

47:25.333 --> 47:26.867
How you doing, brother? You good?

47:26.969 --> 47:30.270
Mwah. Good to see you.

47:32.808 --> 47:34.507
Well...

47:35.599 --> 47:36.476
I got dragged in.

47:36.578 --> 47:37.910
How was it?

47:38.012 --> 47:41.181
Fine, after your father
got done browbeating Kevin

47:41.283 --> 47:42.948
over his handshake.

47:43.051 --> 47:44.350
He could probably use it.

47:45.316 --> 47:47.253
Right, because the tensile
strength of his grip alone

47:47.355 --> 47:49.222
will dictate his outcome in life.

47:49.324 --> 47:50.456
You'd be surprised.

47:52.226 --> 47:54.026
Listen, he's doing his best to hide it,

47:54.128 --> 47:55.995
but your father is...

47:56.097 --> 47:58.197
wrecked by what's
happened between you two.

47:58.299 --> 48:00.700
He gave as good as he got, believe me.

48:00.802 --> 48:01.867
Maybe.

48:01.969 --> 48:03.069
But men of his age,

48:03.171 --> 48:06.038
the big blows have an actual
effect on their health.

48:06.140 --> 48:07.707
Yeah, in Somerset Maugham stories.

48:07.809 --> 48:09.274
He's an ox.

48:09.376 --> 48:11.543
He'll likely see me into the ground.

48:11.645 --> 48:15.414
Chuck, I might be persuaded to let it go
if you were sleeping through the night.

48:15.516 --> 48:18.650
But you are basically the undead
wandering the house until morning,

48:18.752 --> 48:20.652
so some resolution would help you, too.

48:22.389 --> 48:25.256
If he came brokering peace,
I'd hear him out.

48:28.494 --> 48:31.262
What, you want me to initiate,
for Christ's sake? Come on.

48:38.438 --> 48:39.838
Yes, General?

48:39.940 --> 48:42.172
You scheduled a press
conference for tomorrow?

48:42.275 --> 48:44.342
<i>Not yet, but wise idea.</i>

48:44.444 --> 48:46.377
Yes, given the wave of outrage at MCC

48:46.479 --> 48:48.978
and sympathy for the young man,
I think it makes sense

48:49.080 --> 48:51.180
to tell them that we
will not be prosecuting.

48:51.283 --> 48:53.650
<i>Yes. Tonight José Lugo</i>

48:53.752 --> 48:55.318
is quite the cause célÃ¨bre.

48:55.420 --> 48:57.787
But we are most certainly prosecuting.

48:57.889 --> 49:01.791
<i>I read different websites than you do,
watch different shows.</i>

49:01.893 --> 49:05.862
<i>The more your</i> New York Times
<i>is blaring about Lugo's mistreatment,</i>

49:05.964 --> 49:09.398
the more Breitbart is inflamed
about a dead prison guard.

49:09.500 --> 49:13.435
This case has national attention now,
so attention must be paid.

49:13.537 --> 49:16.239
You savvy what I'm saying to you, Chuck?

49:16.340 --> 49:20.942
You, uh, want to proceed
with the prosecution?

49:21.044 --> 49:24.012
I don't know how cooperative
the witnesses at MCC will be.

49:24.114 --> 49:26.248
Reading between the lines of that story,

49:26.350 --> 49:27.449
I think the warden...

49:27.551 --> 49:28.817
Warden's been fired.

49:28.919 --> 49:30.452
<i>But you got a good point.</i>

49:30.554 --> 49:32.254
<i>You got some leaks up there,</i>

49:32.356 --> 49:35.123
<i>either in your shop, the prison's.</i>

49:35.225 --> 49:36.325
I'll plug 'em.

49:36.427 --> 49:39.494
Yeah, well, you'll do more than that.

49:39.596 --> 49:41.062
Where I come from,

49:41.165 --> 49:42.697
the dogs don't stop yapping,

49:42.800 --> 49:44.232
you don't just muzzle 'em.

49:44.334 --> 49:47.602
You hit 'em with a shock collar
until they quiet up nice.

50:02.480 --> 50:03.618
What is it?

50:03.720 --> 50:07.588
The attorney general is ordering me
to prosecute an innocent man,

50:07.691 --> 50:09.990
and I don't think I can
stop it from happening.

50:18.367 --> 50:21.168
I have yet to meet the
man you can't outmaneuver.

50:22.905 --> 50:25.239
Find your angle.

50:33.248 --> 50:34.681
Is that blood?

50:34.783 --> 50:36.316
Not mine.

50:36.418 --> 50:38.952
I-I hit someone tonight, hard.

50:39.054 --> 50:40.721
Self-defense, or...

50:40.823 --> 50:43.223
That law book you're reading
would call it assault.

50:43.325 --> 50:45.291
Battery, too.

50:45.393 --> 50:48.194
With intent to harm?

50:48.296 --> 50:52.765
With intent to try and make myself feel
like I was actually doing something.

50:52.868 --> 50:54.868
Did it work?

50:54.970 --> 50:56.635
Nothing is. Move over.

51:10.585 --> 51:14.253
They're in this.

51:14.355 --> 51:17.655
I can't look away from it anymore.

51:28.602 --> 51:31.303
Are you trying to show me
something by working this late?

51:31.405 --> 51:33.738
No. By this.

51:37.243 --> 51:38.943
Effort's never been my problem.

51:39.045 --> 51:40.678
No, you're an effort guy.

51:40.781 --> 51:42.246
That's why I keep you around.

51:42.348 --> 51:44.048
No matter who else I bring in here.

51:55.962 --> 51:58.095
Great. Have a good night.

51:58.197 --> 51:59.931
Thanks for hanging in.

52:00.033 --> 52:00.965
What's up?

52:01.752 --> 52:03.901
Didn't work. We got to do Lugo.

52:04.908 --> 52:07.003
We announce tomorrow,
so file first thing.

52:07.853 --> 52:08.904
You serious?

52:08.939 --> 52:15.178
Mm-hmm, as heart attacks and cancer
and all those serious things.

52:16.078 --> 52:18.114
Proposed strategy?

52:28.001 --> 52:29.278
Play racial animus.

52:29.313 --> 52:31.775
Associate Lugo with the
violence of his neighborhood.

52:31.810 --> 52:33.523
Imply unofficial gang affiliation

52:33.558 --> 52:35.999
through any friends or acquaintances
with records or old charges.

52:36.760 --> 52:38.001
Tie this death to
recent police violence,

52:38.103 --> 52:39.902
like it was payback.

52:40.004 --> 52:42.271
Hammer the most convenient
version of the facts.

52:42.373 --> 52:44.674
Lugo, while awaiting
charges for drug possession,

52:44.776 --> 52:46.141
had a confrontation with a man

52:46.243 --> 52:48.110
hired to protect the
public from criminals,

52:48.212 --> 52:50.880
and that man is now dead.

52:50.982 --> 52:53.549
I guess you <i> do</i> have it in you.

52:54.698 --> 52:56.986
Is this how it's going to be now?

52:58.698 --> 52:59.888
Yes, it is.

52:59.991 --> 53:02.791
And no.

53:04.551 --> 53:06.566
You know all those cases
we dropped for the A.G.?

53:06.601 --> 53:08.051
- Yeah.
- Tomorrow morning,

53:08.086 --> 53:09.631
I want you to start working
that Ponzi scheme case

53:09.733 --> 53:11.433
- that hurt all those teachers.
- LeRoy?

53:11.535 --> 53:13.850
Yes, in earnest and off the radar.

53:13.885 --> 53:16.137
Start building it out.
We'll figure out who to give it to.

53:16.239 --> 53:17.338
And go to your FBI agent

53:17.440 --> 53:20.441
and start adding others
that fit the bill.

53:20.544 --> 53:22.443
This space is now assigned to you.

53:23.707 --> 53:25.814
Officially, it is where you
will review office priorities.

53:25.916 --> 53:28.282
Unofficially, it will be our war room.

53:29.734 --> 53:32.620
Where we, the Maquisards,
will mount the resistance.

53:32.722 --> 53:36.891
We will not let this son of a bitch
define justice for the SDNY.

53:51.063 --> 53:51.839
Who are you?

53:54.596 --> 53:56.629
Hey!

53:56.731 --> 53:57.764
Hey, stop!

53:57.866 --> 53:59.399
Hi, Mike.

53:59.501 --> 54:02.068
Good job winning the board over.

54:02.170 --> 54:03.803
Axe?

54:03.905 --> 54:07.073
I am here to set the terms.

54:07.175 --> 54:08.441
I thought.

54:08.543 --> 54:10.643
Well, of course you did.

54:10.745 --> 54:15.281
But. You will move assets
how and when I tell you.

54:15.383 --> 54:18.617
Your 2 and 20 is now 1 and 10.

54:18.719 --> 54:20.886
The rest will be converted
into cryptocurrency

54:20.988 --> 54:22.088
and paid to me.

54:22.190 --> 54:23.456
You will sign documents

54:23.558 --> 54:26.325
testifying to your full
and willing participation

54:26.427 --> 54:27.793
in all of this right now.

54:27.895 --> 54:30.329
Those documents will
disappear from sight,

54:30.431 --> 54:31.830
but they'll always exist.

54:31.932 --> 54:36.167
The gentlemen here will
help you handle the details.

54:39.873 --> 54:42.273
You have been brought back to life,

54:42.375 --> 54:44.342
as promised.

54:44.444 --> 54:45.844
But it's not free.

54:46.641 --> 54:48.981
You can refuse right now, right here,

54:49.083 --> 54:53.351
but then everything will go away.

54:53.453 --> 54:56.387
Are you in?

54:59.226 --> 55:03.060
Are you in?

55:06.099 --> 55:09.433
Good.

55:09.535 --> 55:12.937
Then all is as it
should be in the world.

55:32.224 --> 55:34.191
You are now officially but unofficially

55:34.293 --> 55:37.794
the proud owner of half of
my half of Panay's fund,

55:37.896 --> 55:39.696
paid in crypto, of course.
