49:15.953 --> 49:18.080
Yeah. I know, I just can't...

49:19.289 --> 49:21.500
I just can't do anything

have to deliver this baby.

49:28.840 --> 49:29.840
You.

49:30.592 --> 49:35.055
And what happens
if somethin' happens to my baby?

49:36.556 --> 49:40.310
Do you understand that, then,
you are gonna have to kill me,

49:40.394 --> 49:42.562
because I wouldn't wanna be here.

49:43.188 --> 49:44.314
I wouldn't be able to live.

49:44.398 --> 49:46.525
Don't say that. Don't say that. I'm not...

49:47.401 --> 49:48.276

Okay, okay, I got it.

50:49.004 --> 50:50.881
I got it. It's in my pocket.

50:50.964 --> 50:51.964
It's in my pocket.

- Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
- Hey, hey, hey, relax!

51:16.907 --> 51:19.927
- I shot a fucking cop. It's your fault!
- Not a cop. He's a fucking scumbag.

51:19.951 --> 51:21.751
- Oh, shit.
- He's a bad guy. He's a murderer.

51:21.787 --> 51:23.914
- [groans]
- If you didn't shoot him, somebody would.

51:23.997 --> 51:25.791
- I never...
- He's not a cop, man.

51:25.874 --> 51:27.626
- He's a killer with a badge.
- Oh, shit.

51:27.709 --> 51:29.920
- Gonna get us killed. Wanna see your wife?
- Yeah.

51:30.003 --> 51:31.439

52:13.630 --> 52:14.840
Hey, baby.

52:14.923 --> 52:17.759
He's lost a lot of blood. Uh,
take the blanket and apply pressure.

52:18.301 --> 52:20.512
Okay, okay, okay. I got you, good.

52:20.595 --> 52:23.356
I got you, baby. I got you, you're good.
You're all right. Look at me.

52:23.431 --> 52:24.871
Look at me. Look at me. You're fine.

52:24.933 --> 52:26.184
They... They took your wife.

52:26.268 --> 52:27.310
- [Abe] Sh.
- Where?

52:27.394 --> 52:30.397
- Uh, I don't know.
- Fix him, man. Fix him. Fix him.

52:30.480 --> 52:32.320
If I give him a shot,
I won't have one for you.

52:32.399 --> 52:34.609
I don't care! Do it, do it, do it!
I got you, baby.

52:34.693 --> 52:35.986
Look at me, stay with me.

52:36.069 --> 52:38.446
You're okay, man. Look at me. You're okay.

52:39.239 --> 52:42.075
- Just bleedin' a little bit, all right?
- He's lost a lot of blood.

52:42.159 --> 52:43.159
[Mateo groans]

52:43.785 --> 52:45.036
There's nothin' I can do.

52:46.079 --> 52:50.000
- [gasps] Am I goin'?
- No, man, you ain't goin', all right?

52:50.250 --> 52:52.419
- Am I goin'?
- Look at me. You're fine, man.

52:52.502 --> 52:54.480
- You ain't goin' anywhere.
- I can't feel anything.

52:54.504 --> 52:56.631
- That's okay, I want you to relax.
- The pain's gone.

52:56.756 --> 52:59.759
That's good. That's good, all right.
I want you to just relax.

52:59.843 --> 53:01.803
Okay, I'm gonna get you all cleaned up.

53:01.887 --> 53:03.847
- I'm here for you now. All right?
- Okay.

53:03.930 --> 53:05.449
- All right?
- I didn't tell them shit.

53:05.473 --> 53:07.785
- Didn't fucking tell them nothing.
- I didn't tell 'em shit.

53:07.809 --> 53:11.730
[laughs] We don't do that fuckin' shit.
Hey, look at me, look at me.

53:12.647 --> 53:14.487
Remember as a kid,
you were afraid of the dark?

53:14.524 --> 53:15.567
- Mm.
- What'd I tell you?

53:15.650 --> 53:17.670
- To close my eyes. Close my eyes.
- Close your eyes.

53:17.694 --> 53:18.778
Close your eyes, Mat.

53:18.862 --> 53:20.756
- You're okay. I'm gonna take care of you.
- Okay.

53:20.780 --> 53:22.782
- Close your eyes.
- Okay.

53:22.908 --> 53:24.910
- Let your mind go, Matty.
- [whimpers]

53:24.993 --> 53:27.454
Let your mind go. Let your mind go.

53:28.413 --> 53:30.373
I'm gonna get you outta here, okay?

53:30.790 --> 53:33.877
I want you to relax.
We're gonna get out of here.

53:34.753 --> 53:36.630
I'm gonna get you out of here, okay?

53:37.505 --> 53:39.049
Okay, hold on to me.

53:39.132 --> 53:41.885
Ssssh. Sssssh.

53:42.802 --> 53:43.845
Breathe.

53:44.596 --> 53:47.265
I want you to relax
and let your mind go.

53:49.392 --> 53:51.394
You let your mind go.

53:52.145 --> 53:53.438
You're okay.2

54:18.797 --> 54:20.090
[sighs]

54:20.173 --> 54:24.386
Okay, okay. Now you're okay, Mat.

54:25.303 --> 54:27.222
[Paul] You told him he was gonna live.

54:28.390 --> 54:29.390
Yeah.

54:31.810 --> 54:32.810
Why?

54:33.645 --> 54:36.147
I gave him what anybody would want, man.

54:36.231 --> 54:38.358
- What he never had.
- What?

54:42.279 --> 54:43.279
Hope.

54:49.411 --> 54:50.578
I gave him hope.

54:52.706 --> 54:54.457
[sobbing]

54:57.836 --> 54:59.421
[whispers] Oh, I got you, Mat.

55:03.800 --> 55:04.926
You're okay.

55:05.885 --> 55:06.970
You're okay.

55:27.866 --> 55:29.159
[alarm chirps]

55:32.329 --> 55:34.039
- I heard about Jones.
- Yeah.

55:36.082 --> 55:39.336
We'll mourn later. Right now,
I need you on evidence.

55:39.419 --> 55:42.630
Everything seized from the pawn shop
gets vouched here first.

55:43.256 --> 55:46.009
And I want to see that Guermo footage
before you wipe it.

55:46.760 --> 55:50.347
This is Robbery-Homicide's show now,
we don't need Narco buttin' in.

55:51.681 --> 55:53.183
The woman's having complications.

55:54.726 --> 55:55.935
[Regina] Aren't we all?

55:56.394 --> 55:57.437
Bring her in.

56:05.570 --> 56:07.530
You know, there's a pharmacy
around the corner.

56:07.614 --> 56:10.367
I know the staff there,
I can get you some painkillers.

56:13.787 --> 56:15.413
You got a name for that baby?

56:18.375 --> 56:19.959
We haven't thought of one for him yet.

56:22.796 --> 56:23.796
Him?

56:24.964 --> 56:26.007
Yeah.

56:29.803 --> 56:32.013
[gasps]

56:32.847 --> 56:33.848

Go.

56:40.063 --> 56:41.398
[moans]

56:51.074 --> 56:53.618
You know, my old man used to beat the shit
out of my mother.

56:54.869 --> 56:57.956
Used to do it to her, used to do it to me.

57:01.376 --> 57:03.002
When my brother was born, it got worse.

57:03.628 --> 57:06.107
One night, she got tired of gettin'
the shit kicked out of her,

57:06.131 --> 57:08.174
so she shot him in the head
when he was sleepin'.

57:08.550 --> 57:09.759
- [chuckles]
- [checks gun]

57:11.219 --> 57:12.429
She died in prison.

57:14.180 --> 57:16.015
I raised my brother from that point on.

57:19.060 --> 57:20.186
Where are you goin'?

57:20.979 --> 57:23.648
I'm going to kill 'em. All of 'em.

57:24.774 --> 57:26.234
And what about my wife?

57:27.068 --> 57:28.194
Pick up a weapon, man.

57:28.778 --> 57:30.572
And do what? Go gunnin' for cops?

57:30.655 --> 57:31.906
They're dirty cops.

57:31.990 --> 57:34.742
Which will matter a few months
from now in a courtroom,

57:34.826 --> 57:37.996
- long after we're shot dead.
- What other fuckin' choice you got?

57:38.079 --> 57:39.330
They got your wife.

57:40.457 --> 57:41.457
Your baby.

57:42.459 --> 57:44.878
Everybody says they'd do anything
for their fuckin' family.

57:44.961 --> 57:47.505
Well, this is as fucking
"anything" as it gets right now, pal.

57:51.217 --> 57:52.260
Pick up the gun.

57:58.391 --> 57:59.476
Kushie.

57:59.559 --> 58:00.393
What?

58:00.477 --> 58:03.229
The piñata, the stupid piñata
at Cheetah's place.

58:03.313 --> 58:05.565
- Oh, the fuckin' camera.
- Yeah.

58:05.899 --> 58:07.734
Lewis would've took that shit
into evidence.

58:07.817 --> 58:09.569
Yeah, so how the hell do we get it back?

58:10.945 --> 58:12.238
[screams]

58:12.780 --> 58:14.032
[groans]

58:14.115 --> 58:17.243
Can I get you something? Water? Juice?

58:17.327 --> 58:21.331
What is this, a fucking flight?
I need a doctor, bitch.

58:21.414 --> 58:23.249
No, I can't help you with that.

58:23.875 --> 58:24.876
[whimpers]

58:25.835 --> 58:28.421

- You know, I... I met your husband.

58:30.215 --> 58:31.424
I can see why you married him.

58:32.967 --> 58:33.967
Did you kill him?

58:35.261 --> 58:36.304
No.

58:36.387 --> 58:40.016

the hospital, killed one of mine.
