00:48.940 --> 00:51.810
Anguishing groans from
an unidentified man.

00:52.880 --> 00:59.050
More groaning, heavy breathing,
stifled cries.

01:08.660 --> 01:12.900
Man's cries become louder,
more desperate.

01:13.900 --> 01:15.570
Terrible screams.

01:16.770 --> 01:18.410
It happened a year ago.

01:18.540 --> 01:21.540
I wish I could tell this story
from beginning to end but

01:21.680 --> 01:23.480
I don't remember it that way.

01:23.580 --> 01:24.480
I do remember...

01:24.480 --> 01:26.450
Freddy, you promised me
the gig was mine.

01:26.580 --> 01:28.020
Well, I changed my mind.

01:28.020 --> 01:31.050
I need someone whose name I can
put on the flyer and pack this
room.

01:31.390 --> 01:32.090
And that ain't you, pal.

01:32.090 --> 01:34.760
Look, I got fired from The Void.
I need this shot, c'mon.

01:34.890 --> 01:37.520
A real DJ gets this job.

01:37.660 --> 01:39.790
I mean, what are you?

01:39.930 --> 01:42.430
You're a nice guy,
but you ain't no real DJ.

01:42.560 --> 01:44.830
Any idiot can be a iPod DJ.

01:44.970 --> 01:46.700
At least tell me who you got?

01:47.840 --> 01:49.740
What's up. How you're doing?

01:49.870 --> 01:50.870
We're all set for you.

01:51.010 --> 01:52.140
I'll give it an eye check.

01:52.470 --> 01:53.870
What the fuck, Rekles?

01:54.010 --> 01:55.480
Yeah, Rekles!

01:55.610 --> 01:58.450
He's got Serato,
he actually mixes the music...

01:58.550 --> 02:01.650
Plus he's got like
5,000 fans on-line.

02:01.820 --> 02:02.680
What do you got?

02:03.950 --> 02:05.150
Look, it's just business bro.

02:05.750 --> 02:07.150
It's just business...?

02:07.860 --> 02:08.590
Sound of angry gesture.

02:11.360 --> 02:16.400
The rest of the story is in
fragments, bits and pieces that
jump around.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.730
I was hung up
on chance and faith,

02:19.870 --> 02:22.400
trying to figure out why
I was going nowhere.

02:24.010 --> 02:26.010
That's when she came along.

02:27.910 --> 02:29.510
Eric, open up!

02:30.610 --> 02:32.050
Eric, I know you're in there!

02:32.380 --> 02:33.850
Come on!
It's an emergency!

02:35.650 --> 02:37.620
We had a deal. I told you
not to come back tonight.

02:37.750 --> 02:39.490
I know,
I need to stay here tonight.

02:39.620 --> 02:40.550
Eric? Who's at the door?

02:40.690 --> 02:42.090
Nothing, baby,
I'll be back in a minute!

02:42.420 --> 02:43.020
Go the fuck away.

02:43.030 --> 02:45.030
If you're in trouble,
I don't wanna be involved.

02:45.360 --> 02:47.130
Eric, please!

02:47.830 --> 02:50.160
I swear I'll call the fucking
cops!

02:50.500 --> 02:51.500
OK, just let me get my things.

02:51.630 --> 02:52.670
Signe, I'm dialing!

02:52.800 --> 02:54.000
Stop, Jesus!

02:55.100 --> 02:56.740
Just gimme my guitar.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.410
And be careful with it!

03:03.340 --> 03:04.080
My shoes!

03:04.950 --> 03:06.810
Eric, fuck, I'm barefoot!

03:11.890 --> 03:12.650
Christ...

03:14.860 --> 03:16.790
The girl was in trouble.

03:17.090 --> 03:18.890
But it wouldn't have been
my problem if Peter,

03:19.030 --> 03:22.130
the guy she called first,
had picked up his phone.

03:24.030 --> 03:28.640
Or Igor, the photog was probably
snapping shots downtown.

03:30.970 --> 03:32.710
Steven couldn't see his part.

03:32.840 --> 03:34.580
He started a midnight gym
routine

03:34.710 --> 03:37.780
after she joked that his tits
were bigger than hers.

03:38.650 --> 03:40.680
And calling Rachel was
pointless.

03:40.820 --> 03:42.950
Their fling ended badly
after she told Rachel

03:43.080 --> 03:44.650
she was just exploring.

03:45.520 --> 03:47.520
Rachel felt used.

03:48.160 --> 03:50.060
That left me,

03:50.390 --> 03:51.860
I was last on her list.

03:52.990 --> 03:54.730
We met five weeks ago
at The Void,

03:54.860 --> 03:56.900
I thought she was into me.

03:57.070 --> 04:00.630
I got her digits, called her.
Never heard back until...

04:04.370 --> 04:04.910
Hello?

04:05.940 --> 04:06.840
August?

04:07.340 --> 04:08.040
Hi!

04:08.880 --> 04:09.910
Remember me?

04:10.410 --> 04:12.750
The Swedish girl
you met at the The Void.

04:12.880 --> 04:14.720
You're the girl who
doesn't call anybody back.

04:14.850 --> 04:16.820
Yeah, I know,
I've been real busy.

04:16.950 --> 04:21.120
I was wondering if you
wanna grab a drink or something?

04:22.490 --> 04:24.120
I've been at The Void,
but I didn't see you.

04:25.060 --> 04:26.830
Yeah, cause I got fired.

04:26.960 --> 04:27.730
Oh...

04:27.860 --> 04:30.600
Maybe I can help
to cheer you up.

04:31.530 --> 04:33.900
Just one drink. Come on.
It'll be fun.

04:34.040 --> 04:34.940
I dunno...

04:35.070 --> 04:35.870
Hey listen...

04:35.870 --> 04:41.640
I'm leaving the States
and I'd really love to see you.

04:43.540 --> 04:45.510
It'll be worth your while.

04:45.750 --> 04:46.710
I promise.

04:48.520 --> 04:49.980
What to do.

04:50.750 --> 04:52.420
Something about this
didn't sound right.

04:52.550 --> 04:53.950
Then I remembered...

04:54.090 --> 04:55.890
What did my horoscope say?

05:02.100 --> 05:03.060
OK...

05:05.770 --> 05:10.040
Meet me at Happy Ending,
Broome and Forsyth, 20 minutes.

05:10.370 --> 05:12.470
OK, 20 minutes.

05:13.910 --> 05:14.980
OK.

05:47.980 --> 05:49.410
Are you nervous?

05:50.010 --> 05:51.010
Terrified...

05:51.950 --> 05:53.450
of your fashion sense.

05:53.580 --> 05:54.650
What's going on with the get-up?

05:54.780 --> 05:56.580
I got locked out of my
apartment.

05:58.520 --> 06:01.620
So...
you need a place to crash?

06:02.420 --> 06:04.660
Tell me this, you're just
locked out of their apartment

06:04.790 --> 06:08.430
in a trench coat and flip-flops?

06:10.830 --> 06:12.970
Are you waiting
for somebody else?

06:13.100 --> 06:14.170
No.

06:14.500 --> 06:15.670
Are you sure?

06:16.500 --> 06:18.640
I just don't really wanna be
here.

06:18.770 --> 06:20.010
If you get me...

06:21.380 --> 06:22.940
Do you get me?

06:23.510 --> 06:24.880
August.

07:10.530 --> 07:11.430
Wow...

07:11.430 --> 07:12.930
If I'd have known you were
that type of girl,

07:12.930 --> 07:15.000
I would've paid you up front.

07:20.070 --> 07:20.900
What are you doing with my
phone?

07:21.040 --> 07:21.670
Don't touch that!

07:21.670 --> 07:23.570
I'm about to call the police
to report a robbery,

07:23.570 --> 07:26.070
I ain't using up my minutes,
this shit is expensive!

07:26.410 --> 07:26.910
Put that down!

07:26.910 --> 07:28.910
Are you kidding me, right?
You're going through my wallet,

07:28.910 --> 07:30.980
now you want to get back
because I have your phone?

07:31.080 --> 07:33.910
- You're crazy. - Listen, I just
needed some cash.

07:34.050 --> 07:35.050
I put it back...

07:35.380 --> 07:36.920
You don't know
what you're doing, OK?

07:37.850 --> 07:39.720
Look, I should be kicking you
the fuck out.

07:39.850 --> 07:41.390
But now you got me curious.

07:41.520 --> 07:43.120
What do you got here?
Naughty pictures?

07:43.460 --> 07:44.830
Who were you fucking last night
before me?

07:44.960 --> 07:45.830
Give it to me!

07:45.960 --> 07:47.690
Don't! Don't!

07:47.830 --> 07:49.760
August! August!

08:07.580 --> 08:08.450
Is this real?

08:09.750 --> 08:12.890
What the fuck I'm looking at.
It is fucking real?

08:51.630 --> 08:52.530
Ahhh...

09:06.440 --> 09:09.740
It's the real to see death
right on front of you.

09:10.850 --> 09:12.380
By the time it was all over,

09:12.510 --> 09:13.780
this will be another thing

09:13.920 --> 09:15.720
Nicholas and I
would have in common.

09:26.930 --> 09:28.600
Does your father know?

09:32.100 --> 09:33.900
What about your mother?

09:34.670 --> 09:36.600
Mom's in the cottage
in Connecticut.

09:37.770 --> 09:40.510
And you don't know
where the girl went?

09:40.710 --> 09:41.610
No.

09:42.740 --> 09:45.080
Let's forget
about the girl for now.

09:45.480 --> 09:46.680
OK...

09:47.580 --> 09:51.420
What is
your daily morning routine?

09:53.090 --> 09:56.720
I go for a run and I practice
my...

09:57.790 --> 09:58.760
Practice what?

10:03.460 --> 10:04.060
OK.

10:06.430 --> 10:08.070
Clean this all up.

10:09.040 --> 10:11.000
Go for a drive, clear your mind.

10:11.340 --> 10:12.610
Come back in an hour,

10:12.740 --> 10:15.810
excercise,
practice whatever it is you do.

10:17.480 --> 10:20.750
If she calls the cops,
I got friends there.

10:21.420 --> 10:23.450
Your father's got friends there.

10:23.580 --> 10:25.520
If she contacts you,

10:25.650 --> 10:28.020
you call me immediately, huh?

10:30.360 --> 10:33.760
Meantime, let's see what
I can learn about this...

10:35.900 --> 10:38.430
I didn't mean for this to
happen.

10:39.470 --> 10:41.100
Nobody ever does.

10:50.480 --> 10:51.910
Abuela, I'm starvin'.

10:52.450 --> 10:53.510
Where's your brother?

10:53.650 --> 10:54.680
I dunno.

10:54.680 --> 10:57.020
I said it a million times.
Do I look like his keeper?

10:59.750 --> 11:01.860
There will be no food
for anyone here

11:01.990 --> 11:03.690
until your brother comes home.

11:03.820 --> 11:04.990
It's Sunday!

11:05.630 --> 11:07.030
He is supposed to be here.

11:08.400 --> 11:11.830
It's 11:30. He was supposed
to be here at eleven.

11:13.430 --> 11:16.840
If you don't show up on time
in this life,

11:16.970 --> 11:19.810
you always be left behind
in the next.

11:20.040 --> 11:21.680
Where are you going?

11:23.510 --> 11:25.950
I gotta go eat.
I ain't living like this.

11:30.450 --> 11:31.080
Abuela...

11:33.950 --> 11:36.660
You can't get yourself
worked up like this,

11:37.830 --> 11:38.830
Alright?

11:41.100 --> 11:42.030
Alright?

11:44.670 --> 11:45.570
Yo, Sparky...

11:46.530 --> 11:47.770
What's up, nigga?

11:49.440 --> 11:51.640
Yo, you see
my little brother around?

11:52.540 --> 11:53.470
You sure?

11:56.510 --> 11:57.140
Jésus!

11:58.580 --> 11:59.680
Hey yo...

12:00.480 --> 12:01.780
Wake your ass up!

12:16.700 --> 12:17.900
Hello, Yuri...

12:19.030 --> 12:21.670
Yeah, the new supply got done.

12:22.340 --> 12:24.940
He had some family shit
to deal with.

12:26.970 --> 12:28.070
Alright.

12:39.690 --> 12:41.720
You fuckin' amateur.

12:42.890 --> 12:46.090
Angel's first clue was
in his brother's profile status.

12:46.430 --> 12:48.060
Jésus was dealing again.

12:48.400 --> 12:49.830
But Angel knew
where to look for him

12:49.960 --> 12:51.460
because in the Lower East Side

12:51.600 --> 12:53.030
veryone has a friend in common .

12:53.630 --> 12:54.630
Even though I didn't know it,

12:54.640 --> 12:56.170
the girl and I
were already linked,

12:56.170 --> 12:57.970
but the chain starts with Jésus.

12:57.970 --> 13:00.140
He friend-quested everyone
he dealt drugs to.

13:00.470 --> 13:01.640
Most didn't accepted.

13:01.780 --> 13:03.710
I was one of the few who did.

13:03.810 --> 13:07.580
I came over with my parents from
Nigeria to Newark NJ at age of
7.

13:07.720 --> 13:10.550
Yeah, people really do
emigrate to New Jersey.

13:10.950 --> 13:12.990
All I wanted is to be a DJ.

13:13.820 --> 13:15.760
I met a girl named Alicia and
had a short run

13:15.890 --> 13:19.430
when she got me gigs with
the coked-out trust fund set.

13:20.360 --> 13:23.400
I dropped out of college cause
we had plans for New York
together.

13:23.530 --> 13:26.100
Until she dumped me
for a Rastafarian.

13:28.040 --> 13:29.870
My parents practically
disowned me.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.410
I got a job bar-backing at
The Void on Ludman Street,

13:33.540 --> 13:36.410
But every night I dreamed that
I'd be spinning all over the
world,

13:36.540 --> 13:38.550
Berlin, Amsterdam, London.

13:38.650 --> 13:42.150
But I never get there until I
saved enough to buy a Serato
Scratch.

13:42.480 --> 13:43.850
Then, I'd be legit.

13:46.720 --> 13:49.390
So to get back to the girl,
there's a few more people along
the way.

13:49.520 --> 13:50.860
But there is no need
to remember them all,

13:50.990 --> 13:52.930
except for this guy... Amir.

13:53.060 --> 13:55.630
He's the only friend
I could always count on.

13:55.760 --> 13:57.930
There is definitely no need
to remember Jeremy.

13:58.070 --> 14:00.770
He lasted less than a month
at The Void.

14:01.370 --> 14:04.540
He was fired for inappropriate
use of the restroom.

14:04.670 --> 14:07.610
He would've gotten away with it
if they didn't wreck the sink,

14:07.810 --> 14:11.010
causing the manager to check
the security tape.

14:11.950 --> 14:14.410
And never mind about
his lady friend, Suzie Voight,

14:14.550 --> 14:17.420
an aspiring fashion designer
over at the FIT.

14:17.850 --> 14:19.750
Or even her roommate,
Ana from Bogotá,

14:19.890 --> 14:23.160
who moved here to intern
in documentary filmmaking.

14:23.790 --> 14:25.930
Now this is where
it gets interesting.

14:26.060 --> 14:27.830
Ana's co-worker Stephanie...

14:27.960 --> 14:30.460
Stephanie, always told Ana about
a new guy she was seeing,

14:30.600 --> 14:33.700
like the musician she met
a few weeks earlier named Eric.

14:35.070 --> 14:36.770
I'll be back in a sec.

14:38.910 --> 14:42.140
Eric had never told Stephanie
about his adventures in
Stockholm.

14:42.480 --> 14:45.010
Which brings us
full circle to the girl.

14:45.610 --> 14:47.410
They met at a lounge
in Södermalm

14:47.550 --> 14:50.080
when Erick bought her
a drink after her set.

14:50.750 --> 14:52.790
They spoke till dawn about
her love of music,

14:52.920 --> 14:56.620
her need to find herself, and
her dream of living in New York.

14:57.760 --> 14:59.060
Eric thought she was the one

14:59.060 --> 15:02.060
and invited her to move into
his Lower East Side loft.

15:02.400 --> 15:03.700
But the honeymoon ended fast

15:03.830 --> 15:05.030
when they actually got
to know each other.

15:05.370 --> 15:06.900
That's when he tossed her out.

15:07.030 --> 15:08.000
For his own sense of closure,

15:08.000 --> 15:10.740
he decided to delete her
from his "friend list."

15:10.870 --> 15:12.910
But by then,
we were already directly linked.

15:13.040 --> 15:15.110
And she was standing right next
to me in my apartment.

15:21.680 --> 15:23.720
Is this fucking real?

15:26.590 --> 15:27.650
No.

15:27.760 --> 15:28.860
Bullshit,
because I know these guys.

15:28.990 --> 15:30.720
It's none of your business, OK?

15:32.830 --> 15:33.760
What the fuck.

15:34.060 --> 15:35.860
- Who is it?
- Angel.

15:36.060 --> 15:36.560
Fuck.

15:36.700 --> 15:37.630
Who is it?

15:37.630 --> 15:39.730
It's the fucking brother
of the dead guy on your phone.

15:40.670 --> 15:42.470
Do they think I'm involved?

15:42.600 --> 15:44.000
I don't even know the guy!

15:44.340 --> 15:45.410
What am I going to do?

15:45.540 --> 15:46.670
Hold on one second, man!

15:46.810 --> 15:48.940
How...?
What are we going to do?

15:49.080 --> 15:49.580
We?

15:49.580 --> 15:51.440
You have to help me now, OK?

15:51.550 --> 15:53.050
You have to help me.

15:58.450 --> 16:01.020
Yo. What up? What up?

16:01.890 --> 16:03.390
What took you so damn long, man?

16:03.520 --> 16:04.690
My bad, my bad.

16:08.630 --> 16:09.400
It's good.

16:13.530 --> 16:15.540
Smells like sex in here.

16:15.900 --> 16:17.170
You got a broad in here, man?

16:17.500 --> 16:19.110
I thought I heard
a woman voice in here.

16:19.440 --> 16:21.040
No, just me, how the hell
you'd get in the building?

16:21.380 --> 16:22.180
Sure you're not having sex?

16:22.180 --> 16:24.480
Hey, you better be
wearing protection.

16:24.580 --> 16:28.380
There is a lot of shit out
there, man, you're a dirty bird.

16:28.520 --> 16:29.750
You're dirty fucking bird.

16:29.880 --> 16:30.750
Angel.

16:33.350 --> 16:35.050
How you doing, man?

16:36.590 --> 16:37.890
- Surviving.
- Surviving?

16:38.030 --> 16:38.930
Surviving.

16:38.930 --> 16:41.060
Why you surviving when
you can be living, man.

16:41.400 --> 16:43.460
Yo, you and I should
get back in business.

16:43.600 --> 16:45.570
August...
Those were good times...

16:45.700 --> 16:47.800
I told you I'm done
with that shit, man.

16:47.940 --> 16:50.140
And how you making ends meet?

16:53.770 --> 16:55.070
This is past due, right?

16:55.410 --> 16:56.540
Nosey motherfucker.

16:56.680 --> 16:57.540
This one too, man.

16:57.640 --> 16:58.850
You motherfucker, like yo...

16:58.850 --> 17:02.580
I don't need you coming up here
and reminding me about this
shit!

17:03.650 --> 17:06.589
I know you're not here to talk
about business, so what's up?

17:08.359 --> 17:11.119
- Straight to the point?
- Straight to the point.

17:14.730 --> 17:16.730
I have some questions
about Jésus.

17:19.500 --> 17:21.099
First, I gotta go take a piss .

17:41.720 --> 17:43.960
Yo, Sparky, what you got?

17:45.790 --> 17:48.590
Yeah, who's that nigga
that saw him?

17:51.800 --> 17:53.770
Alright, I'll be there
in a minute.

17:54.900 --> 17:56.470
Everything alright?

18:00.340 --> 18:01.470
Jésus has been ghost.

18:01.610 --> 18:04.540
We got a lead,
so I'm gonna go check it out.

18:04.810 --> 18:06.710
If you hear anything,
let me know, right?

18:06.850 --> 18:07.550
- Yeah.
- Right?

18:07.680 --> 18:08.680
Yeah.

18:09.580 --> 18:10.850
I'm gonna be the first one
to kick his ass

18:10.980 --> 18:12.520
before my grandma gets to him.

18:19.460 --> 18:20.860
- Bye.
- Bye.

18:30.440 --> 18:32.770
Take your guitar and get out.
You gotta go.

18:32.910 --> 18:34.810
- Let me think for a moment.
- No thinking.

18:34.940 --> 18:36.680
If you want to think,
I can bring Angel back up here

18:36.810 --> 18:38.010
and you can think with him.

18:38.380 --> 18:40.980
Be careful with that!
It's important to me.

18:41.320 --> 18:42.010
OK.

18:42.720 --> 18:43.650
Right.

18:44.590 --> 18:45.650
OK.

18:46.450 --> 18:49.620
I'm asking you please
to leave my apartment.

18:50.090 --> 18:50.920
Please.

18:51.960 --> 18:53.390
What did you tell him?

18:53.560 --> 18:54.430
Nothing.

18:54.560 --> 18:56.000
I didn't tell him nothing.

18:56.360 --> 18:59.400
OK, just let me explain, right?

19:03.340 --> 19:04.540
I was broke.

19:05.840 --> 19:07.510
This guy talked really rich...

19:07.640 --> 19:11.740
I thought I'd go with him
and if things go right,

19:11.850 --> 19:15.410
I'd have a place to stay
and I can figure things out.

19:15.980 --> 19:17.920
So we're doing cocaine
and we had fun.

19:18.050 --> 19:22.790
And all of the sudden,
this friend-dealer shows up...

19:23.090 --> 19:27.690
And all I remember is that we
were high out of our minds
and...

19:28.960 --> 19:30.460
Then they started to argue.

19:30.800 --> 19:32.570
Arguing about what?

19:34.100 --> 19:36.400
Arguing about
who's going to fuck me first.

19:37.400 --> 19:38.600
I freaked out!

19:38.740 --> 19:40.740
I ran, I hid in the closet.

19:40.870 --> 19:41.740
All I remember,

19:41.740 --> 19:44.840
I was holding my camera
watching Jésus getting murdered.

19:44.950 --> 19:48.920
I wanted to help him but I knew
I'm gonna get killed next.

19:50.580 --> 19:53.890
So I ran out, I called all
the numbers in my phone.

19:54.020 --> 19:57.690
I don't know why, out of all the
people, it had to be you!

19:58.560 --> 20:00.760
This is my fucking life.

20:00.960 --> 20:03.660
Shit always happens to me,
but no...

20:03.800 --> 20:05.400
No, not this time.

20:05.530 --> 20:07.430
If you need help,
you need to go to the cops.

20:07.570 --> 20:10.070
No! I can't go to the police,
I don't trust the police!

20:10.400 --> 20:12.100
By the way,
that guy is fucking nuts!

20:12.440 --> 20:15.410
And he said his father
is powerful and rich!

20:26.950 --> 20:29.790
You said
you know this Nicholas, right?

20:30.920 --> 20:32.760
Yeah, yeah...

20:32.890 --> 20:34.490
He's a fucker,

20:34.630 --> 20:36.500
I'd have a job right now
if it wasn't for him.

20:36.630 --> 20:38.000
He is a fucker.

20:40.500 --> 20:43.540
August, we have the phone
and the video.

20:44.070 --> 20:45.840
And he might want it...

20:46.070 --> 20:47.940
He might even need it back.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.080
OK?

20:50.040 --> 20:51.640
Why don't you talk to him?

20:51.850 --> 20:54.150
What do you mean "talk to him"?

20:58.420 --> 20:59.620
Signe?

21:01.660 --> 21:04.160
What do you mean "talk to him"?

21:05.690 --> 21:06.860
What I mean is,

21:07.530 --> 21:09.460
you seem like you need help.

21:09.460 --> 21:11.560
So you either kick me out,

21:11.900 --> 21:13.500
or you talk to him,

21:13.630 --> 21:15.130
and we all get
what we really need.

21:15.470 --> 21:17.440
- Fucking Christ.
- August.

21:21.340 --> 21:23.810
I need some air and some food.

21:25.980 --> 21:26.680
Hey...

21:26.680 --> 21:29.820
How do I know you won't
just walk out and turn me in?

21:29.950 --> 21:31.080
You don't.

21:31.650 --> 21:33.150
If Angel came to talk to me,

21:33.490 --> 21:35.090
that means he's talked
to everyone else on the block.

21:35.420 --> 21:37.160
You're probably already fucked.

21:37.490 --> 21:38.890
If he finds out I hid you here,
I'm fucked.

21:39.030 --> 21:41.760
If he finds out I lied about
his brother, I'm super-fucked!

21:41.900 --> 21:42.930
So as far as I'm concerned,

21:42.930 --> 21:46.470
your sense of security doesn't
mean shit to me right now.

21:49.870 --> 21:51.000
I didn't trust her.

21:51.010 --> 21:53.810
What were the odds our fates
would cross this way?

21:53.940 --> 21:56.010
That lead me to how
my money trouble started.

21:56.340 --> 21:58.480
The guy's a better quarterback
his brother Patton.

21:58.580 --> 21:59.510
Do you even watch football?

21:59.650 --> 22:01.750
No, I think
he's better quarterback.

22:02.980 --> 22:05.020
Fucking retard....

22:13.700 --> 22:16.630
If was just community service I
got for sucker-punching a
yuppie,

22:16.760 --> 22:17.900
it would have been one thing.

22:18.700 --> 22:21.100
It was a civil settlement that
really screwed me over.

22:21.440 --> 22:22.870
Motherfucker!

22:23.000 --> 22:26.470
I don't usually go Mohammed Ali
over stuff like that.

22:26.610 --> 22:28.170
But that night I was
totally hammered

22:28.510 --> 22:31.540
cause I was still upset by what
happened earlier that day.

22:36.580 --> 22:37.750
Yo, where you at?

22:37.880 --> 22:39.920
I just parked on Ave C.

22:40.050 --> 22:40.890
Hurry up!

22:46.790 --> 22:47.790
What's going on, B?

22:47.800 --> 22:50.130
You know these windows
are illegally tinted, right?

22:50.600 --> 22:52.430
Officer, I've been driving
for a year like this...

22:52.570 --> 22:54.800
License, registration
and get out of the car.

22:59.070 --> 22:59.970
Bingo.

23:00.370 --> 23:01.510
Whoops.

23:01.940 --> 23:02.840
Sugar for your coffee?

23:04.010 --> 23:05.410
Turn around,
put your hands behind you back.

23:08.820 --> 23:11.780
Jesus and I barely spoke
since his arrest.

23:12.490 --> 23:14.850
Felt so guilty that
he got busted and I went free,

23:14.990 --> 23:17.820
I got trashed just to get it
out of my head.

23:18.660 --> 23:20.460
That lead
to punching the yuppie,

23:20.590 --> 23:21.790
as the more I got wasted,

23:21.930 --> 23:24.160
the deeper I drifted
into my mind.

23:26.100 --> 23:29.940
It was also that night I got the
first tremors in my hand.

23:30.640 --> 23:31.940
Too broke to see a doctor.

23:41.480 --> 23:43.520
All this leads to Nicholas.

23:44.580 --> 23:46.690
He always made me feel
invisible.

23:46.820 --> 23:48.450
No shaving...

23:48.720 --> 23:50.560
Thank you, Captain.

23:50.690 --> 23:52.390
And for the hundredth time,

23:52.530 --> 23:53.990
Nicholas didn't tip.

23:55.900 --> 23:58.000
Why not get even
for Jésus and myself?

23:58.330 --> 24:00.800
After all, it's partly my fault
that Jésus was dead

24:00.930 --> 24:04.770
since I introduced Nicholas to
him to score drugs in the first
place.

24:04.910 --> 24:06.440
- You still got my number.
right? - Yeah, yeah.

24:08.880 --> 24:10.110
Pick up the water, too.

24:19.490 --> 24:20.950
What the fuck are you doing?

24:21.090 --> 24:23.990
The one time August retaliated,
I got fired.

24:24.990 --> 24:27.390
That's when I remembered what
Jésus said to me once:

24:28.060 --> 24:29.960
In life,
you either fuck or get fucked.

24:30.100 --> 24:31.660
Make sure it's you
doing the fucking.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.600
So even if I didn't trust her,

24:33.730 --> 24:36.000
why not screw Nicholas
for 50 grand anyway?

25:13.910 --> 25:15.740
So, you're just gonna go?

25:16.910 --> 25:20.450
If you don't want me here,
I'll find my own way.

25:22.850 --> 25:24.420
So what do you think?

25:30.590 --> 25:32.060
Let's talk to him.

25:49.110 --> 25:50.740
Nicholas wasn't all bad.

25:50.840 --> 25:53.050
But to understand him
meant knowing his history.

25:53.380 --> 25:54.910
His life had always been tied
to Wall Street

25:55.050 --> 25:56.620
because his father, Charles,

25:56.750 --> 25:59.750
created Feinman Securities in
1965.

26:00.550 --> 26:02.520
Charles was one of the guys
who founded the NASDAQ

26:02.660 --> 26:05.490
and revolutionized
the world of finance.

26:06.030 --> 26:09.630
His maxed his profits by serving
only the most elite clients.

26:15.470 --> 26:20.440
And by the 80s, Charles handled
18% of transactions on Wall
Street,

26:20.670 --> 26:24.440
until he was hit hard
in the '87 stock market crash.

26:38.730 --> 26:41.430
Feinman couldn't let this happen
again in the recession of the
90s,

26:41.560 --> 26:43.100
so he created a formula to
provide

26:43.430 --> 26:45.530
huge returns
on his clients' investments.

26:46.570 --> 26:48.870
But he really stashed their
money into his own bank accounts

26:49.000 --> 26:51.770
while giving them reports
of huge gains.

26:53.810 --> 26:55.410
Soon he had billions in play,

26:55.540 --> 26:56.910
but with the most
recent market crash,

26:57.040 --> 26:58.880
investors rushed to cash out,

26:58.980 --> 27:02.680
finding that he couldn't pay
back money that no longer
existed.

27:10.390 --> 27:13.060
Charles' one and only obssesion
was the company,

27:13.390 --> 27:15.430
at the cost of other
relationships,

27:15.560 --> 27:18.030
including with his son,
Nicholas.

27:20.700 --> 27:24.040
Nicholas lost touch with his
father during his years at
Princeton,

27:24.400 --> 27:27.040
got tired of being
second to the company.

27:27.710 --> 27:30.040
But after college, his desire
for his father's approval

27:30.380 --> 27:34.910
drove him to Wharton Business
School and back into the family
business.

27:39.390 --> 27:42.760
I realize now that Nicholas was
just as lost as I was.

27:43.020 --> 27:47.830
All that money and privilege
could never replace the love of
a father.

27:48.860 --> 27:51.930
Nicholas' most prized possession
was his violin.

27:52.070 --> 27:55.900
Playing it was the only thing
that made him feel at ease.

28:05.480 --> 28:07.710
But on that day, it couldn't
ease the guilt he felt

28:07.850 --> 28:09.950
after what happened to Jésus.

28:54.430 --> 28:57.700
She always thought fate
would bring her to New York.

29:00.070 --> 29:04.600
She ran away to Stockholm from
her hometown of Skane at
seventeen.

29:06.340 --> 29:10.110
Though her parents loved her,
she felt they never understood
her.

29:10.440 --> 29:12.010
And Skane was too ordinary.

29:12.650 --> 29:14.580
She can never be ordinary.

29:14.880 --> 29:17.020
All she had was her music.

29:19.820 --> 29:23.160
She got her first guitar as a
gift from her dad at thirteen.

29:23.490 --> 29:26.560
She loved it so much that
she practiced non-stop.

29:26.690 --> 29:28.860
In Stockholm, it wasn't much
better than Skane though.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.860
She never found
her place there either.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.500
She had to do things to make
money to pursue her music,

29:33.630 --> 29:35.600
things she was
unable to confront.

29:35.740 --> 29:37.000
Then she start running again.

29:37.340 --> 29:40.040
And now in New York,
she still felt alone.

29:40.370 --> 29:42.940
She joked once that even though
she had 221 friends

29:43.080 --> 29:44.680
on her online profile,

29:44.780 --> 29:46.850
there were still no one
to eat dinner with.

29:49.320 --> 29:51.750
You can't live here
for free anymore, OK?

29:51.890 --> 29:52.720
Fuck the music shit!

29:53.990 --> 29:56.120
You know I can't work.
I'm looking for gigs.

29:56.460 --> 29:58.660
You got two weeks to move out!

29:58.790 --> 30:02.560
And now that I got a girl here,
you're shit out of luck, OK?

30:06.800 --> 30:08.770
She didn't want
to be hurt anymore.

30:08.900 --> 30:10.840
And she was tired of running.

30:10.970 --> 30:12.570
She felt like no matter
what she did,

30:12.710 --> 30:16.140
she couldn't escape that feeling
she had since she was seventeen.

30:16.480 --> 30:19.180
There was no place for her
in the world.

30:20.580 --> 30:24.750
Somehow, as unlikely as it
seemed, we became connected.

30:30.560 --> 30:33.690
I ripped my pants.
Can you turn round?

30:33.990 --> 30:35.590
Cover your eyes.

30:36.930 --> 30:38.630
- Can I help you?
- No, it's OK, I got it.

30:38.770 --> 30:40.970
No, just give it to me.
Let me help you.

30:41.100 --> 30:43.040
- No, it's OK...
- No, it's OK, trust me.

30:43.370 --> 30:45.540
I used to sew my own dresses
when I was a little girl.

30:48.680 --> 30:50.740
So, anyway...

30:51.510 --> 30:53.850
I talked to a few people that I
used to work with, and
apparently

30:53.980 --> 30:56.480
this guy is a lot more loaded
than we thought.

30:56.620 --> 30:59.050
His dad owns
some big securities firm.

30:59.590 --> 31:00.450
I knew it.

31:00.450 --> 31:03.420
You sure there's nothing else
you remember from that night?

31:03.560 --> 31:05.990
I told you I'm trying to
block...

31:06.330 --> 31:08.460
those memories from my mind.

31:09.760 --> 31:11.860
All I can remember is blood.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.900
If we're gonna do this,
you have to remember, OK?

31:15.940 --> 31:17.770
What about before
you got to his place?

31:17.900 --> 31:20.840
Anything he said?
Anything that happened?

31:22.580 --> 31:24.740
We got very drunk at the bar.

31:24.910 --> 31:28.850
I don't think he had cash
because he used his card for the
taxi.

31:31.050 --> 31:31.920
Yeah...

31:31.920 --> 31:35.420
Before we got into the taxi
though, he called Jésus.

31:36.820 --> 31:37.560
C'mon...

31:37.690 --> 31:39.630
What about on the way there?

31:40.360 --> 31:42.630
No, we just talked.

31:44.360 --> 31:46.100
He said he loved music.

31:46.870 --> 31:47.830
He plays violin.

31:47.970 --> 31:49.430
Yeah, what else did he say?

31:50.900 --> 31:52.000
I don't know...

31:52.570 --> 31:54.410
I told him about Sweden.

31:54.540 --> 31:56.040
He talked about New York.

31:56.380 --> 31:57.480
We drove past a museum.

31:57.480 --> 32:01.110
He said his family helped make
the Lower East Side what it is.

32:01.450 --> 32:03.020
That they still contribute
to the museum.

32:03.920 --> 32:05.920
Take a note to ask...

32:10.520 --> 32:12.620
Hey, thanks for the clothes,

32:13.530 --> 32:15.530
and letting me stay.

32:17.400 --> 32:18.500
Yeah...

32:18.970 --> 32:20.670
Yeah, you're welcome.

32:24.100 --> 32:25.700
OK, here we go.

32:27.740 --> 32:28.810
Great.

32:34.750 --> 32:35.780
You keep on
checking out the window.

32:35.920 --> 32:36.820
Yeah...

32:37.020 --> 32:39.080
I'm two months behind
on my rent.

32:39.420 --> 32:42.390
I gotta make sure my landlord
doesn't ambush me.

32:43.390 --> 32:45.060
Oh, sorry but...

32:45.930 --> 32:48.430
Yeah, thanks for...

32:50.060 --> 32:51.630
...stitching my...

32:57.070 --> 32:58.000
Yeah.

33:06.580 --> 33:10.550
Now, what's so urgent about a
coat check girl you're banging?

33:10.680 --> 33:14.050
This guy who's harassing her is
some fucking security big-wig.

33:14.390 --> 33:16.660
And the manager, the owners,
want me to look into it.

33:16.920 --> 33:17.760
What's it have to do with me?

33:17.760 --> 33:19.930
I figured anybody know anything
about these finance guys,

33:20.060 --> 33:20.890
it'd be you,

33:21.030 --> 33:22.790
Mr. Investigative Reporter.

33:22.930 --> 33:24.900
Look, August, I don't have time

33:25.030 --> 33:26.530
to chase some guy
who's screwing your girl?

33:26.670 --> 33:29.130
Indy, don't do this, c'mon!

33:31.100 --> 33:33.110
Who used to hook you up
back at Rutgers?

33:33.440 --> 33:35.540
I mean who helped you lose
your fucking virginity?

33:35.680 --> 33:37.080
She was a hooker,

33:37.410 --> 33:39.750
and you lied that
she was a transfer student!

33:39.850 --> 33:43.450
- She put some hair on that
chest. - I was born with hair on
my chest!

33:46.350 --> 33:47.490
I'm gonna help you out,

33:47.620 --> 33:49.150
but you gotta give me
more to go on.

33:49.490 --> 33:50.590
Anything on the father?

33:50.590 --> 33:54.590
All I got is the son, Nicholas,
tall, white, pretty boy.

33:54.730 --> 33:57.100
Oh, that's great. Tall, white,
pretty boy named Nicholas?

33:57.430 --> 33:59.560
That will really
narrow it down for me.

34:00.400 --> 34:01.630
Is he WASP,
or one of the chosen?

34:01.770 --> 34:03.940
I dunno. Apparently he said
something about

34:04.070 --> 34:06.540
his father being the reason
Lower East Side what it is,

34:06.670 --> 34:09.469
bragging to her about
contributing to some old museum.

34:09.610 --> 34:12.679
If it's in the Lower East, it's
probably the Tenement Museum.

34:12.780 --> 34:15.880
That's a start. At least, I'll
check out their donor records.

34:16.020 --> 34:18.679
Oh shit, man,
I gotta pick up my daughter.

34:18.820 --> 34:20.150
- Call you when I get a hint?
- Thank you.

34:20.489 --> 34:22.120
Alright, brother,
in the meantime,

34:22.460 --> 34:23.719
why don't you go home
and see if you can

34:23.860 --> 34:27.389
keep your girl from fucking
this guy for a few hours.

34:36.639 --> 34:37.670
Signe?

34:42.610 --> 34:43.610
Signe?

35:01.990 --> 35:05.500
Yo, nix that shit, man! I can't
stand that fuckin' dancehall.

35:05.630 --> 35:08.870
Nigga, dancehall
can't stand you either, boy.

35:09.340 --> 35:10.940
What's up Raul, José?

35:11.070 --> 35:12.440
Wazzup, man.

35:13.710 --> 35:15.940
Except we're waiting for
these punk-ass bitches

35:16.080 --> 35:17.480
to finish their game.

35:17.610 --> 35:20.580
Sparky said you all was with
Jésus last night?

35:20.680 --> 35:23.750
Supposed to hit this spot
that was the jump off,

35:23.880 --> 35:26.020
all of a sudden that nigga
just peaced out.

35:26.350 --> 35:27.750
But he said
he was supposed to meet us

35:27.890 --> 35:29.720
at the courts today though,
so...

35:29.860 --> 35:31.060
Did he say where he was going?

35:31.390 --> 35:32.390
Nah, he just split.

35:32.530 --> 35:33.860
He said something about Ludlow,

35:35.090 --> 35:36.600
but I don't fuck around
there no more, yo,

35:36.730 --> 35:40.070
I ain't tryin' to fuck with none
of these white bitches no more,
yo.

35:40.400 --> 35:41.770
You tell Jésus,

35:41.900 --> 35:43.570
if you see him,
that Angel's looking for him.

35:43.700 --> 35:44.770
No doubt, man.

35:49.080 --> 35:50.980
I always felt a bond with Angel.

35:51.080 --> 35:53.550
Our parents had brought us
here for a better future.

35:53.680 --> 35:55.850
We were part of a history that
stretched all the way back

35:55.980 --> 35:57.380
to the 19th century...

35:57.520 --> 35:59.750
That's when the first free
African-American slaves

35:59.890 --> 36:02.050
made their homes in this place.

36:02.390 --> 36:04.860
There were joined
by waves of Irish.

36:05.420 --> 36:10.530
By the 1870s, more that 170,000
Germans became the next wave.

36:12.800 --> 36:14.870
The Germans and Irish were
joined in the Lower East Side

36:15.000 --> 36:16.870
by the Italians.

36:17.540 --> 36:18.870
By the early 1900s,

36:19.010 --> 36:21.510
the European Jews found
their home in the LES.

36:21.640 --> 36:25.580
Among them was Herschel Feinman,
great-grandfather of Nicholas.

36:26.580 --> 36:29.380
No, if I see him, I'll tell you.

36:33.950 --> 36:36.090
...suffer! You don't understand,
this is my house!

36:36.420 --> 36:36.990
Shut the fuck up!

36:36.990 --> 36:40.160
Jésus, Jésus!
You saw him! Jésus!

36:58.950 --> 37:00.980
The most recent immigrants
were Chinese,

37:01.310 --> 37:03.110
Puerto Rican and Dominican,

37:03.520 --> 37:06.050
including Luz Guzman
and her two sons,

37:06.390 --> 37:07.390
Jésus

37:07.520 --> 37:08.590
and Angel.

37:11.920 --> 37:14.460
Yo, I was just about
to call you, man.

37:14.590 --> 37:15.760
I called you yesterday, all day.

37:15.900 --> 37:17.830
Yo man, it was my day off.

37:21.770 --> 37:24.070
- Where's Jésus?
- Haven't seen him.

37:24.600 --> 37:26.910
He left a message
on his computer,

37:27.040 --> 37:29.670
like maybe he was doing
some business Saturday night.

37:29.810 --> 37:31.710
You point anyone his way?

37:31.910 --> 37:34.410
I might have supplied a number
to an overeager customer.

37:34.550 --> 37:35.980
Ain't fucking around, Dre.

37:36.550 --> 37:37.620
All I know is his name
is Nicholas.

37:37.750 --> 37:38.680
Nicholas what?

37:38.690 --> 37:40.990
Nicholas "I need some coke
right now cuz I got some

37:41.320 --> 37:43.490
"horny pussy
that needs to be fucked."

37:43.620 --> 37:45.760
I didn't get
his full government name.

37:47.690 --> 37:51.400
Hey look, go talk
to this girl named Maria,

37:51.530 --> 37:54.130
fine-ass bartender
across the street at Piano.

37:54.470 --> 37:56.870
She usually gets in
around about 7.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.040
I heard the two of them
smashed once.

37:59.640 --> 38:01.040
Everything changed for Angel

38:01.370 --> 38:02.740
after what happened
during those days.

38:02.740 --> 38:06.010
And I can't fully blame him
for what he felt he had to do.

38:30.840 --> 38:31.640
Maria?

38:31.640 --> 38:33.810
Maria, can I talk to you
for a minute?

38:33.940 --> 38:34.840
About what?

38:34.970 --> 38:36.680
A guy named Nicholas...

38:36.810 --> 38:39.480
You met him at The Void,
he took you home.

38:40.050 --> 38:41.910
Is he a friend of yours?

38:42.380 --> 38:45.150
- Cuz that guy's a fuckin' dick.
- I know he is.

38:46.420 --> 38:48.090
That's why
I want to talk to you.

38:48.420 --> 38:49.920
What happened with you two?

38:51.090 --> 38:52.660
He takes me home,

38:52.790 --> 38:55.830
tries to force me
to fuck him without a condom,

38:55.960 --> 38:59.060
I tell him no way,
then he wants to go anal,

38:59.400 --> 39:02.100
I tell him I'm not so much
into anal anymore,

39:03.000 --> 39:04.900
and then he kicks me out.

39:05.840 --> 39:07.510
You don't hold back
on your details, do you?

39:07.670 --> 39:09.910
No, I don't fuck around.

39:10.610 --> 39:14.110
Or are you the type who
likes to beat around the bush?

39:14.480 --> 39:15.580
Nah...

39:15.950 --> 39:17.380
I get straight to the point.

39:17.520 --> 39:19.950
See, Nicholas,
he ain't a friend of mine.

39:20.090 --> 39:22.950
In fact, he did something
similar to someone who is.

39:23.620 --> 39:25.090
Remember where he lives?

39:25.660 --> 39:29.560
Listen, just cuz I don't
fuck around

39:29.700 --> 39:31.860
doesn't mean I want any trouble.

39:32.000 --> 39:34.800
You ain't gotta worry
your pretty little face.

39:36.100 --> 39:38.470
I'm just wanna talk
some sense into him.

39:38.600 --> 39:40.710
See, all you gotta do...

39:40.840 --> 39:42.770
is point out the building,

39:42.910 --> 39:44.580
that's all you gotta do.

40:05.930 --> 40:07.170
Where did you go?

40:07.670 --> 40:08.700
Hi.

40:10.500 --> 40:11.700
Just for a walk.

40:12.410 --> 40:14.110
I've been stuck in this place
for two days.

40:14.440 --> 40:15.670
I don't like feeling trapped.

40:15.810 --> 40:17.610
Don't leave the apartment again.

40:17.740 --> 40:19.580
It's such a pretty day.

40:20.610 --> 40:21.910
OK...

40:22.380 --> 40:25.720
- Say no more, I get it.
- No, you don't get it.

40:25.850 --> 40:27.990
We have to protect ourselves,
and you just running off...

40:28.320 --> 40:29.820
Look, it just gives me
a bad feeling,

40:29.960 --> 40:30.990
so don't do it, OK?

40:31.320 --> 40:32.620
Am I a prisoner?

40:34.630 --> 40:36.160
Who'll connect anything?

40:36.500 --> 40:38.460
I don't think
we should be so paranoid.

40:39.060 --> 40:41.930
Or is that bad feeling
from something else?

40:43.000 --> 40:45.070
I saw all those horoscopes.

40:45.400 --> 40:47.710
That's no way
to live life, August.

40:49.380 --> 40:51.440
You can't cheat what's coming.

40:51.540 --> 40:52.510
Don't go through my shit.

40:52.650 --> 40:55.750
Oh, did I touch some sore spot?

40:56.850 --> 40:58.950
Was that a love horoscope?

40:59.450 --> 41:01.690
Are you trying to keep me here
just for yourself?

41:01.820 --> 41:05.920
Lemme make something
crystal clear to you, OK?

41:07.430 --> 41:09.390
You're here because you need me.

41:09.530 --> 41:12.130
I'm letting you stay here
because I need money.

41:12.470 --> 41:14.000
You equal money.

41:14.330 --> 41:15.470
That's it.

41:15.600 --> 41:16.730
Get it?

41:17.600 --> 41:19.540
Just because
you fuck your way into

41:19.670 --> 41:20.940
whatever you want
with others guys,

41:21.070 --> 41:23.810
don't come here and try
that slutty shit with me

41:23.940 --> 41:26.010
cause it's not gonna work.

41:40.090 --> 41:42.930
- It was just a joke, August.
- Ha, ha...

41:43.930 --> 41:45.500
Since you know me so well,

41:45.630 --> 41:48.530
why did you let me fuck my way
into here two nights ago?

41:50.000 --> 41:51.970
To be honest with you...

41:52.610 --> 41:54.010
I kind of felt sorry for you.

41:54.470 --> 41:56.140
- Oh really?
- Yeah.

41:56.480 --> 41:58.110
Then why don't you
forget everything then

41:58.410 --> 42:00.080
and just feel sorry for me
a bit longer?

42:00.410 --> 42:02.480
Just a bit longer? Alright?

42:04.350 --> 42:06.650
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

42:07.520 --> 42:11.490
August, there are things about
me you'll never understand.

42:11.820 --> 42:14.560
So don't you ever talk to me

42:14.690 --> 42:17.730
like I'm just a
stupid, pathetic whore?

42:25.840 --> 42:26.840
Hello.

42:28.840 --> 42:31.010
Hey, hi Indran, yeah.

42:33.710 --> 42:36.380
No, I'm fine, OK.

42:39.350 --> 42:41.120
Thank you, thank you.

42:41.790 --> 42:42.790
Yeah.

42:46.990 --> 42:47.860
What?

42:49.630 --> 42:50.960
Nicholas Feinman.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.100
Now we know where he lives.

43:01.010 --> 43:04.140
I dunno,
I was pretty wasted by then.

43:04.980 --> 43:06.840
You can't remember
anything specific?

43:11.520 --> 43:13.520
What did he try with your girl?

43:14.750 --> 43:15.750
It was a guy.

43:16.760 --> 43:17.990
Ohhh...

43:18.460 --> 43:20.890
Didn't know he was a swinger.

43:26.500 --> 43:27.630
There it is.

43:28.500 --> 43:29.700
That's the one.

43:35.610 --> 43:36.840
Take this number.

43:37.880 --> 43:39.540
If you need anything,

43:39.910 --> 43:42.450
anything at all,
let me know.

43:42.750 --> 43:43.550
Alright?

43:43.980 --> 43:45.050
Here...

43:46.750 --> 43:48.120
Get yourself a cab.

43:50.990 --> 43:52.020
Thanks, Babe.

43:54.430 --> 43:55.590
I'll call you.

44:08.670 --> 44:11.610
There's your favorite loverboy,
right there.

44:26.790 --> 44:27.990
Nicholas?

44:28.660 --> 44:30.530
You're Nicholas Feinman?

44:31.900 --> 44:33.560
Yeah, what do you want?

45:15.340 --> 45:17.440
Where the fuck is my brother?

45:19.680 --> 45:22.080
Put the gun away and I'll tell
you.

45:28.320 --> 45:29.150
He's dead.

45:30.420 --> 45:31.720
I didn't do it.

45:31.990 --> 45:32.890
I swear.

45:35.090 --> 45:36.390
Really?

45:44.400 --> 45:46.470
I'm very sorry for your loss.

45:47.510 --> 45:49.010
What the fuck happened?

45:49.340 --> 45:50.410
He was shot,

45:51.340 --> 45:52.880
right where you're sitting,
with his own gun.

45:53.010 --> 45:54.950
We had this girl here,
I met her at The Void.

45:55.080 --> 45:55.810
You know The Void?

45:55.950 --> 45:57.450
I know The Void.
Spit it out!

45:58.350 --> 45:59.820
So I meet her there,
bring her home,

45:59.950 --> 46:02.550
Jésus comes over and
we're all doing blow.

46:02.690 --> 46:06.090
I said wait for a second and
then she went fucking crazy.

46:06.760 --> 46:08.430
Shot Jésus.

46:08.930 --> 46:10.030
I swear.

46:14.330 --> 46:14.830
And his body?

46:14.830 --> 46:16.430
I don't know,
I called my father and

46:16.440 --> 46:18.070
- ...he cleaned it up.
- Clean it up!

46:18.440 --> 46:19.440
Huh?

46:19.840 --> 46:21.640
He's a piece of garbage!

46:21.940 --> 46:25.110
Don't you ever talk about
my brother like that again.

46:25.440 --> 46:26.440
Got it?

46:28.350 --> 46:29.850
You're gonna call your Daddy

46:29.980 --> 46:32.120
and get my brother's body back.

46:33.020 --> 46:34.790
- Got it?
- I got it.

46:34.990 --> 46:36.850
I'm sorry, sorry.

46:38.860 --> 46:40.790
Look, it was a tragedy,

46:40.930 --> 46:42.160
your brother was a dealer.

46:42.490 --> 46:45.460
This could cause more
trouble for you, me.

46:45.700 --> 46:49.530
Your family, my family,
who knows?

46:50.970 --> 46:52.940
But I can help you find her.

46:57.910 --> 46:58.680
Open it.

46:58.680 --> 47:00.080
Why should I trust
you're telling the truth?

47:00.080 --> 47:03.010
Why shouldn't
I just blast your ass right now?

47:03.480 --> 47:06.020
You could,
but you wouldn't get far.

47:06.490 --> 47:07.850
Your face is
on the cameras in the lobby,

47:07.990 --> 47:10.420
the doorman could pick you
from a lineup.

47:10.560 --> 47:12.490
No offense, but if something
happens to someone like me,

47:12.620 --> 47:13.660
it's not the same.

47:13.790 --> 47:14.660
Trust me.

47:14.660 --> 47:18.830
Besides, why would I
steal her wallet for fun?

47:19.060 --> 47:20.160
The money?

47:27.740 --> 47:29.970
Now Yuri, I told you I was...

47:31.040 --> 47:32.580
My brother...

47:36.350 --> 47:38.580
Well, how long
do you need me for?

47:41.720 --> 47:42.550
Fuck!

47:48.930 --> 47:51.660
That's the girl
who killed your brother.

48:14.650 --> 48:15.690
Hello?

48:17.060 --> 48:18.020
It's me.

48:19.520 --> 48:21.160
We got another problem.

48:21.530 --> 48:23.530
The brother of the dead guy.

48:26.470 --> 48:28.130
Can you get rid of him?

48:38.580 --> 48:39.680
Right.

48:40.980 --> 48:42.610
Have you seen this chick?

48:42.750 --> 48:44.080
With that Nicholas dude?

48:45.550 --> 48:48.590
Dre, take a closer look, man.

48:49.590 --> 48:51.690
Imagine it was your brother,
man.

48:53.590 --> 48:55.630
What if Twan went missing
just like that?

48:55.960 --> 48:58.860
Twan's twice as big as my ass,
he ain't disappearing nowhere.

48:59.000 --> 49:01.470
Dre,
Jésus didn't just disappear.

49:03.970 --> 49:04.940
He's dead.

49:07.510 --> 49:10.140
And I need to find who
was responsible for this shit.

49:10.510 --> 49:11.080
Damn, man, I'm sorry,

49:11.080 --> 49:13.610
I didn't know it was like that.
You alright?

49:13.750 --> 49:14.710
Nah, man.

49:16.080 --> 49:17.080
I ain't...

49:17.950 --> 49:19.650
Cause when Jésus
came outta jail,

49:19.790 --> 49:21.890
he went crazy in the head, man.

49:22.320 --> 49:25.560
And I told his ass,
if I catch you dealing,

49:26.090 --> 49:27.430
I'm gonna kill you.

49:29.490 --> 49:31.030
Can you believe that shit?

49:31.360 --> 49:33.630
The last thing
I said to my brother...

49:33.770 --> 49:35.100
I'm gonna kill you.

49:35.500 --> 49:38.700
Look, I got a system with
the IDs alright?

49:38.840 --> 49:42.570
Just like I got a photographic
memory or something,

49:42.710 --> 49:46.410
so if I've seen them,
I'd know it, that's the truth.

49:46.510 --> 49:47.650
Alright.

49:50.880 --> 49:53.620
If you see she her come through,
you let me know.

49:53.750 --> 49:55.650
Of course, man, I'm on it.

49:56.050 --> 49:57.890
Photographic memory, baby.

50:16.480 --> 50:18.080
- Hey.
- Hey.

50:18.740 --> 50:20.810
I'll see you soon, alright?

50:21.450 --> 50:24.050
Hey, life with kids'll kill you.

50:24.380 --> 50:26.880
Good to see you boss. I think
this package is for Mr. Feinman.

50:27.020 --> 50:28.420
- You said Feinman, right?
- Yeah.

50:28.550 --> 50:29.720
Mind taking this up?

50:29.860 --> 50:31.690
For you?
Of course, no problem.

50:31.820 --> 50:33.160
Thank you, boss.

51:25.740 --> 51:28.610
Why'd you clean up the place?

51:34.650 --> 51:35.750
Look...

51:37.960 --> 51:40.060
I'm sorry about what I said.

51:40.930 --> 51:42.430
It was wrong.

51:45.760 --> 51:49.070
And whoever you choose to fuck
is your business, but...

51:50.440 --> 51:53.100
The whole
knife-in-the-eye thing...

51:53.570 --> 51:54.610
Really?

51:56.010 --> 51:58.580
It's a bit crazy though, right?

52:00.610 --> 52:03.380
I used to see
lots of different men.

52:04.350 --> 52:06.720
Old rich men
that took care of me.

52:10.990 --> 52:14.020
One of them found out that
he was not the only one

52:14.360 --> 52:15.390
and got jealous.

52:15.530 --> 52:18.530
He locked me in his bedroom
for a week.

52:18.660 --> 52:20.600
That's why I hate
being locked in places.

52:20.730 --> 52:22.700
What happened to the man?

52:27.510 --> 52:29.870
I started a fire to get out.

52:30.510 --> 52:32.780
Then he went to the police

52:32.880 --> 52:35.480
and said I tried
to burn him alive.

52:35.910 --> 52:39.720
So now I can't go back to Sweden
because I go to jail.

52:45.760 --> 52:46.790
What did you get on Angel?

52:46.930 --> 52:48.530
Angel Guzman...

52:48.690 --> 52:51.160
Lower-level dealer
for the Russians,

52:51.730 --> 52:54.430
helps move supply
in the Lower East.

52:54.970 --> 52:56.770
I found his pick-up spot,

52:56.900 --> 52:58.640
and I'm gonna pay him
a visit in the morning.

52:58.770 --> 53:00.470
Good, stay on him,

53:01.340 --> 53:02.040
Get rid of him!

53:02.370 --> 53:03.970
I'll deal with amateur hour.

53:04.110 --> 53:05.840
What did you get on the girl?

53:06.750 --> 53:08.880
Wait till you
get a load of this.

53:18.320 --> 53:20.620
How am I supposed to know
any of this is true?

53:23.400 --> 53:26.060
Why would I lie
about something like that?

53:26.830 --> 53:28.700
Why are you so paranoid, August?

53:32.340 --> 53:33.840
I think a saw a cop

53:33.970 --> 53:36.510
when I went
to drop the package off.

53:40.950 --> 53:41.880
That's why.

53:44.820 --> 53:45.680
Wait.

53:47.020 --> 53:48.450
Are you pulling out?

53:48.590 --> 53:50.790
Look, my life
over the past few years

53:50.920 --> 53:52.690
hasn't been so lucky.

53:52.960 --> 53:54.730
Now I'm not saying I'm innocent,

53:54.860 --> 53:57.460
and everything,
but time is just...

53:59.430 --> 54:02.600
just passing me by and
I'm trying to play catch up.

54:03.540 --> 54:05.140
Now, from this fucking cop,

54:05.470 --> 54:06.800
to these fucking rich kids

54:06.940 --> 54:10.470
that just come down here like
they fuckin' own the place.

54:10.610 --> 54:12.810
No, August...

54:13.680 --> 54:14.980
They don't own us.

54:15.950 --> 54:16.950
Hey.

54:31.760 --> 54:32.700
Yeah.

54:37.640 --> 54:38.940
Let's go somewhere.

54:39.440 --> 54:41.510
- Right.
- Let's do something.

54:42.810 --> 54:44.910
What you do want to do?

54:47.050 --> 54:48.650
They don't own us.

54:49.810 --> 54:52.720
Those words
remind me of possibility.

54:53.950 --> 54:56.520
One of the hardest things
to confront is realizing

54:56.660 --> 54:59.790
you might never be everything
you thought you would.

55:00.360 --> 55:01.730
It's not like we were in love,

55:01.860 --> 55:03.960
we both knew
that we were barely friends.

55:05.530 --> 55:09.030
In those moments, everything
felt possible again.

55:14.570 --> 55:15.770
You look good.

55:17.410 --> 55:18.840
You look good, too.

55:20.450 --> 55:22.780
Thanks again for
cleaning up the place today.

55:25.380 --> 55:27.750
Hmmm, you're vibrating again.

55:39.500 --> 55:40.860
You the one
who left the picture?

55:41.000 --> 55:41.770
Yeah. I'm the one.

55:41.770 --> 55:44.030
Is that fucking cunt with you?

55:44.770 --> 55:47.540
- The only cunt here is your
mother. - Oh.

55:47.810 --> 55:49.740
You think you have balls?

55:49.870 --> 55:52.740
OK, I'd be careful what
I say next, if I were you.

55:52.840 --> 55:53.740
Careful?

55:54.410 --> 55:55.650
Who the fuck are you?

55:55.780 --> 55:58.620
I'm not paying you shit,
now fuck off!

56:00.920 --> 56:03.050
That sounded like it went well.

56:03.390 --> 56:04.620
He told me to be careful?

56:04.760 --> 56:06.460
What a fucking poser!

56:06.620 --> 56:08.160
I'll deal with this guy.

56:08.760 --> 56:09.760
What did he say?

56:09.890 --> 56:11.400
He told me to fuck off.

56:12.100 --> 56:14.030
So what do we do now?

56:20.410 --> 56:20.970
Hello?

56:21.110 --> 56:22.670
Alright, dickhead...

56:22.810 --> 56:24.170
I got an offer for you.

56:24.740 --> 56:26.840
Hang up on me again and
I'm going straight to the cops.

56:26.950 --> 56:28.550
Then you get no money.

56:28.680 --> 56:30.750
Meet me at 2pm tomorrow
on the West Side.

56:30.880 --> 56:33.680
No, you're not making
the rules here, guy.

56:33.820 --> 56:35.490
2 pm, under
the Williamsburg Bridge.

56:35.620 --> 56:36.920
Fine, guy...

56:37.560 --> 56:38.720
Makes no difference...

56:40.330 --> 56:40.660
Fuck!

56:40.660 --> 56:42.730
- The guy's a fucking douchebag.
- I know.

56:42.860 --> 56:44.530
But I'm gonna meet him tomorrow.

56:45.960 --> 56:48.170
Felt kinda good.
Felt pretty good.

56:48.500 --> 56:52.170
So tonight, we dance
because they can't trap us.

56:52.500 --> 56:54.570
And we have fun, OK?

56:54.910 --> 56:56.570
Let's just have fun.

56:56.940 --> 56:59.140
- You're crazy.
- Just have fun!

57:41.720 --> 57:45.420
Music always makes me feel
more alive than anything.

57:45.960 --> 57:49.530
At moments like that,
my mind couldn't help wander...

57:51.000 --> 57:53.430
About how our ancestors
must've lived on these streets,

57:53.570 --> 57:54.570
and in these buildings,

57:54.700 --> 57:57.100
searching for a better tomorrow.

57:57.700 --> 58:01.670
Now here we were, searching for
our own sense of possibility,

58:01.810 --> 58:04.640
we danced on top of our history.

58:43.780 --> 58:45.620
Guess what I just saw?

59:05.500 --> 59:06.640
What is it?

59:06.970 --> 59:09.510
Shit!
I just saw Angel.

59:09.510 --> 59:12.040
- What? Do you think he knows?
- I don't know.

59:12.340 --> 59:13.610
But we're not waiting
around to find out.

59:13.750 --> 59:17.710
Hello, yo, Amir,
I need your help.

59:17.850 --> 59:19.880
Be there in 30 minutes.

59:36.100 --> 59:38.570
Your uncle watches
television all day?

59:38.700 --> 59:42.070
He's obsessed with watching
political news coverage.

59:42.710 --> 59:43.140
Why?

59:43.140 --> 59:45.910
Because back in Bosnia, he
didn't even have a television.

59:46.010 --> 59:48.380
Now he considers it
his patriotic duty

59:48.510 --> 59:50.780
as a proud American
to be informed.

59:52.380 --> 59:53.750
Yo, Amir...

59:55.850 --> 59:57.150
I have to go back.

59:57.490 --> 59:59.060
I gotta get this phone
to handle Nicholas.

59:59.390 --> 01:00:00.060
What about Angel?

01:00:00.060 --> 01:00:02.690
I'll play dumb, as long as
he doesn't see her with me.

01:00:02.830 --> 01:00:04.030
He might not know anything.

01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:06.000
He may just have
a few more questions.

01:00:06.330 --> 01:00:07.530
OK, be careful.

01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:08.600
Alright, man.

01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:18.410
Hey August...

01:00:18.610 --> 01:00:19.510
Yeah.

01:00:21.850 --> 01:00:22.850
What's up?

01:00:28.550 --> 01:00:31.790
It's just so hard to
express myself in English.

01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:35.730
Say it in your language then.

01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:01.390
Are you nervous?

01:01:02.350 --> 01:01:03.520
Terrified.

01:01:30.050 --> 01:01:31.620
I want you out
of this apartment

01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:33.550
- No moving!
- ...by the end of this week.

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:44.900
What's up, man?

01:01:45.530 --> 01:01:46.800
Long time no see...

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.870
Yo, walk this way,
don't try nothing stupid.

01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:52.700
Across the street to the car.

01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:55.170
No holding, I'm walking.

01:01:56.070 --> 01:01:56.910
Get in! Fuck!

01:01:57.040 --> 01:01:58.540
- Hurry up man.
- I got it.

01:01:58.710 --> 01:02:00.110
Put the shit over him!

01:02:00.450 --> 01:02:01.880
Fuck you want to do,
fuckin' pussy?

01:02:03.650 --> 01:02:06.120
- Your woman, fucker!
- Shoot that nigga!

01:02:06.450 --> 01:02:08.720
Yo, shoot that nigga!

01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:42.750
Let up.

01:02:52.530 --> 01:02:54.000
Where the fuck is he?

01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:56.730
I don't know.

01:03:02.370 --> 01:03:04.710
What the fuck
is going on, August?

01:03:04.910 --> 01:03:05.810
Huh?

01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:07.880
Where's the girl?

01:03:08.410 --> 01:03:10.080
Are you in on this shit?

01:03:13.420 --> 01:03:15.750
I swear, I swear, no...

01:03:15.890 --> 01:03:17.420
I don't know him.

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:18.860
I didn't know the girl
before I met her.

01:03:18.990 --> 01:03:20.690
You're gonna say shit to me?

01:03:20.830 --> 01:03:22.590
She begged for my help.

01:03:22.730 --> 01:03:25.060
I swear to you I didn't know
about Jésus until later.

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:28.730
- You lied straight to my face.
- What was I supposed to say?

01:03:29.370 --> 01:03:31.170
What was I supposed
to fucking say?

01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:33.170
I swear,
you'd think I was involved.

01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:33.970
You're supposed to say,

01:03:33.970 --> 01:03:36.640
"Hey Angel, here's the bitch
that killed your brother!"

01:03:36.770 --> 01:03:38.740
What are you talking about?

01:03:39.340 --> 01:03:40.480
She didn't kill Jésus.

01:03:40.610 --> 01:03:41.550
Bullshit!

01:03:42.350 --> 01:03:43.150
Bullshit!

01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:46.450
You keep trying to protect her,

01:03:47.620 --> 01:03:48.790
I'm going to kill you,

01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:51.720
just like I killed
that motherfucker.

01:03:52.860 --> 01:03:54.160
Strike one, August.

01:03:58.530 --> 01:04:00.700
I take no pleasure in this.

01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:05.600
Choke his ass out.

01:04:29.030 --> 01:04:31.160
She was the one
at your house, huh?

01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:33.530
Yeah.

01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:34.830
I knew it.

01:04:35.870 --> 01:04:38.070
And don't tell me
I didn't smell that shit..

01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:40.070
And you was acting funny too.

01:04:40.940 --> 01:04:43.710
What the fuck was she doing
at your house, August?

01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:47.010
- We met at Void.
- What?

01:04:47.350 --> 01:04:48.480
We met at Void.

01:04:49.810 --> 01:04:51.580
She called me
late night for drink.

01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:53.750
I figured it was a booty call.

01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:56.520
I swear on my life

01:04:56.990 --> 01:04:58.920
I didn't know about Jésus.

01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:02.760
And I know there is no way,
there's no way...

01:05:05.660 --> 01:05:06.760
Strike two!

01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:13.600
You and I,
we can square our business.

01:05:14.470 --> 01:05:15.510
But first...

01:05:15.940 --> 01:05:17.610
I want that fucking girl.

01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:21.650
OK. OK.

01:05:21.780 --> 01:05:22.810
OK.

01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:26.880
But you gotta do it my way.

01:05:27.020 --> 01:05:27.620
Your way?

01:05:27.750 --> 01:05:29.790
Go on, go on...

01:05:30.390 --> 01:05:32.520
Fucking be smart here
for a second.

01:05:32.660 --> 01:05:35.560
If I go back looking like this,
she's gonna know something's up,

01:05:35.690 --> 01:05:37.790
and you know
I ain't good at faking.

01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:40.100
Angel...

01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:43.500
You saw right through me
the other day.

01:05:44.870 --> 01:05:46.440
I'm sorry...

01:05:49.010 --> 01:05:50.140
Sorry.

01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:53.440
August,

01:05:54.850 --> 01:05:58.520
I swear to you by everything
that is sacred to me,

01:06:02.490 --> 01:06:03.850
if you fuck me...

01:06:30.380 --> 01:06:33.050
Open the glove compartment
and read the paper.

01:06:45.730 --> 01:06:46.560
What does this mean?

01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:48.470
It means there's no money.

01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:51.400
Feinman Securities is over,

01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:53.070
busted by the SCC.

01:06:53.770 --> 01:06:55.540
Daddy's going to jail.

01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:00.740
OK...

01:07:01.410 --> 01:07:02.680
OK, you know what?

01:07:02.810 --> 01:07:04.650
You gonna find a way
to give me that money,

01:07:04.780 --> 01:07:06.750
or you can look forward
to spending quality bonding time

01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:08.450
with him in lock-up.

01:07:09.020 --> 01:07:11.720
Wait!
You cocksucker...

01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:13.420
Look, here's the deal:

01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:15.860
I got assets of my own,
but I can't touch them.

01:07:15.990 --> 01:07:16.890
Not until this blows over.

01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:18.630
I'm supposed to believe
a cold-blooded murderer

01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:20.160
whose father is a fucking thief?

01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:23.000
I didn't mean to kill anyone!

01:07:23.900 --> 01:07:24.870
OK?

01:07:25.540 --> 01:07:28.540
And I'm nothing
like my father, got that?

01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:31.440
When he's gone, I'm gonna start
things over legitimately,

01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:32.980
alright?

01:07:33.710 --> 01:07:36.750
Just do me a favor,
before you call me a murderer,

01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:38.450
ask that girl about why
she left Sweden?

01:07:38.580 --> 01:07:41.020
I know all about the fire,
it's not what you think.

01:07:41.350 --> 01:07:43.790
What the fuck are you talking
about? There's no fire!

01:07:44.390 --> 01:07:46.120
I had my people
dig into her past.

01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:49.530
First, records show that her
photo is an identical match to

01:07:49.660 --> 01:07:52.100
a woman wanted for
attempted murder in Stockholm.

01:07:52.430 --> 01:07:54.460
She almost stabbed a man to
death.

01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:59.040
Second, there is no one with her
name from her hometown in
Sweden.

01:07:59.370 --> 01:08:00.040
Third...

01:08:00.370 --> 01:08:01.700
Did you ever stop to ask

01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:04.940
how the dead guy on her phone
got covered in blood?

01:08:05.310 --> 01:08:08.080
You have no idea
who she even really is.

01:08:08.580 --> 01:08:11.750
So go check her passport,
you fucking amateur!

01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:15.590
You think you can trust anything
a girl like that says?

01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:17.149
She'll suck you off at night,

01:08:17.490 --> 01:08:19.120
and then fuck you over
in the morning.

01:08:21.830 --> 01:08:23.689
Take that and open it up.

01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:30.130
What the fuck am I supposed
to do with $500?

01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:31.870
An advance.

01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:34.170
You're out of your mind if you
think I'd give you fifty grand.

01:08:34.510 --> 01:08:35.939
But here's the deal.

01:08:36.109 --> 01:08:37.510
Kill the girl,

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:39.779
and I'll give you five grand.

01:08:41.050 --> 01:08:42.080
Kill the girl.

01:08:42.750 --> 01:08:43.880
- You're kidding, right?
- No...

01:08:44.010 --> 01:08:47.050
That fucking bitch
really pissed me off.

01:08:48.620 --> 01:08:50.950
No one gets away
with what she did.

01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:52.560
So...

01:08:52.859 --> 01:08:54.560
I'll give you
another five grand,

01:08:54.689 --> 01:08:56.529
if you destroy every copy
of that footage,

01:08:56.660 --> 01:08:59.460
and bring me her phone with
a new video of her dead body.

01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:01.060
Nah, nah...

01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:04.729
- Can't do that.
- Yes, you can.

01:09:05.340 --> 01:09:07.000
Just keep saying that
to yourself, OK?

01:09:07.340 --> 01:09:08.740
"Yes I can."

01:09:10.439 --> 01:09:11.569
Five to kill,

01:09:12.439 --> 01:09:13.710
five for the phone.

01:09:23.649 --> 01:09:25.090
Jésus, what happened?

01:09:31.330 --> 01:09:33.460
- Did you get the money?
- There is no money.

01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:36.630
- What do you mean...?
- There is no fucking money!

01:09:37.330 --> 01:09:39.170
And specially not for you!

01:09:40.340 --> 01:09:43.470
Why was Jésus covered in blood
on the video?

01:09:43.870 --> 01:09:44.939
Why are you asking me this?

01:09:44.939 --> 01:09:48.649
Why the fuck was Jésus covered
in blood in the video?

01:09:48.750 --> 01:09:49.950
Before Feinman suffocated him?

01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:51.450
I told you they were arguing

01:09:51.580 --> 01:09:53.479
who was going to sleep
with me first, and then...

01:09:53.620 --> 01:09:55.420
- Then what?
- The gun was on the couch...

01:09:55.550 --> 01:09:56.450
- And what?
- Jésus and Nicholas...

01:09:56.590 --> 01:09:58.050
And you murdered him.

01:09:58.390 --> 01:09:59.560
Jesus fucking Christ!

01:09:59.690 --> 01:10:00.620
You murdered him.

01:10:00.630 --> 01:10:04.660
You shot a guy and then used
somebody else to clean up your
mess,

01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:07.160
just like you did in Sweden,
and now you're playing me.

01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:08.670
That's not true, August!

01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:10.470
- Let me see your passport.
- What?

01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:12.740
Let me see your fuckin'
passport. I want to know your
real name.

01:10:12.870 --> 01:10:15.670
- You know my real name.
- You're full of shit.

01:10:16.410 --> 01:10:17.540
Come with me,
we're going for a ride.

01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:18.940
I'm not going anywhere with you,
not like this!

01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:20.510
You don't have a choice.

01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:24.880
OK, what?
What are you going to do?

01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:27.580
You're gonna shoot me?

01:10:28.050 --> 01:10:30.850
Gonna run me,
you gonna stab me and run away?

01:10:34.490 --> 01:10:36.630
I was protecting myself, OK?

01:10:36.860 --> 01:10:39.060
I didn't want to hurt anyone.

01:10:39.700 --> 01:10:41.660
- You have to believe me...
- No!

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:42.930
No.

01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:45.970
Fuck...

01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:49.040
I'm so fuckin' stupid,
cause I knew it.

01:10:49.370 --> 01:10:53.110
I knew it, you basically
prostitute yourself to rich
guys,

01:10:53.410 --> 01:10:56.050
and then claim they locked
you up, or they raped you, or

01:10:56.380 --> 01:10:57.680
whatever fuckin' story
you make up!

01:10:57.820 --> 01:10:59.580
You think you can get away
with it cause you're just a

01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:01.780
pretty, little blond girl?

01:11:03.990 --> 01:11:07.560
With women like you in the
world, there's no such thing as
rape.

01:11:07.690 --> 01:11:08.930
It's just another
four-letter word.

01:11:09.060 --> 01:11:10.530
Fuck you! Fuck you!

01:11:10.730 --> 01:11:12.800
OK! Fuck you! Fuck you!

01:11:12.930 --> 01:11:14.660
Fuck you! Fuck you!

01:11:28.710 --> 01:11:29.580
Come on.

01:11:56.810 --> 01:11:58.710
Sound of Signe and Nicholas
toasting.]

01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:24.970
Ladies first.

01:12:44.620 --> 01:12:45.490
Hello?

01:12:46.590 --> 01:12:47.820
Just tell him
you're here for me

01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:49.490
up in the penthouse.

01:12:49.630 --> 01:12:50.730
Yeah.

01:12:55.070 --> 01:12:56.800
Don't you think it would be

01:12:56.930 --> 01:12:59.540
better, just you and me?

01:13:03.010 --> 01:13:04.670
- Nicholas, right?
- Yeah.

01:13:04.810 --> 01:13:06.410
- That's right.
- What's goin' on?

01:13:06.510 --> 01:13:08.140
You know what?
I remember you now.

01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:10.980
We met before,
you the wild one.

01:13:11.950 --> 01:13:12.920
If you say so.

01:13:13.050 --> 01:13:14.620
- You wanna drink?
- Hmmm...

01:13:16.090 --> 01:13:17.620
I will have one drink man.
I'm driving.

01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:19.660
So don't make it too strong.

01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:28.060
Hey, how you doing?

01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:29.770
Hey.

01:13:30.530 --> 01:13:31.800
What's your name, mama?

01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:33.770
- Signe.
- Signe?

01:13:34.410 --> 01:13:36.040
I like that.
Where's that from?

01:13:36.610 --> 01:13:37.640
It's European.

01:13:37.780 --> 01:13:39.680
- From where?
- I'm Swedish.

01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:41.540
Swedish, look at that.

01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:43.650
My name is Jésus,
and I'm Dominican.

01:13:43.780 --> 01:13:46.820
Alright,
for your holiness, Jésus,

01:13:46.950 --> 01:13:48.420
vodka on the rocks.

01:13:48.550 --> 01:13:49.520
But first,

01:13:49.650 --> 01:13:50.850
how about a round of shots?

01:13:51.050 --> 01:13:52.920
You know, I'll take one shot.

01:13:53.060 --> 01:13:55.660
Just one, I'm driving.
I really can't get fucked up.

01:13:55.790 --> 01:13:56.760
Pussy?

01:13:57.560 --> 01:13:58.800
- Thanks.
- Come on...

01:13:58.930 --> 01:14:00.530
Take off your jacket.

01:14:00.660 --> 01:14:03.700
Nah, it's cool.
Just one shot.

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:06.770
We were so high
on those mushrooms,

01:14:06.900 --> 01:14:09.170
running down the streets
of Amsterdam, butt-naked,

01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:12.110
except for a sock
covering his dick!

01:14:16.010 --> 01:14:18.750
My god, then he tried
to go sailing!

01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:20.650
That's stupid,
you guys are nuts, man.

01:14:20.780 --> 01:14:22.990
Wild! You guys are crazy.

01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:27.620
Let me hit that.

01:14:33.330 --> 01:14:35.430
You know,
you're mad pretty, right?.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.770
I'm sure you say that
to all of the girls.

01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:46.480
That was real good right there.

01:14:47.340 --> 01:14:48.740
Dude, before I forget,

01:14:49.050 --> 01:14:50.610
you got that money
for me, right?

01:14:50.750 --> 01:14:51.810
Ahh...

01:14:54.650 --> 01:14:55.520
No, I don't.

01:14:55.650 --> 01:14:57.620
Come on.
Are you serious?

01:14:59.990 --> 01:15:01.690
How about a deposit?

01:15:01.890 --> 01:15:04.690
That's five bags, that's $250.
Come on, son.

01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:13.800
Jésus, tonight...

01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:16.710
is your lucky night,

01:15:17.110 --> 01:15:18.710
Listen, I don't got cash,

01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:21.610
I didn't feel like going
to the ATM, but...

01:15:21.710 --> 01:15:24.410
Listen to me.
I got something even better.

01:15:26.620 --> 01:15:27.450
Are you serious?

01:15:28.090 --> 01:15:29.420
Yeah bro...

01:15:29.550 --> 01:15:30.620
Of course,
I'm hitting it first.

01:15:30.750 --> 01:15:31.820
No, no, no.

01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:34.620
Sloppy seconds?
I don't like sloppy seconds.

01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:36.030
I'm not doing that.

01:15:37.030 --> 01:15:38.860
Better get used to it, man.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:42.630
I ain't gonna stick my dick
where another dude just finish
doing that.

01:15:42.770 --> 01:15:43.730
I'm gonna hit it first.

01:15:43.740 --> 01:15:45.940
And then I pass it on to you,
and then I bounce,

01:15:46.070 --> 01:15:46.900
and nothing happened.

01:15:46.910 --> 01:15:49.040
You know what I'm saying?
That's a good idea.

01:15:49.570 --> 01:15:52.780
Dude, that is some good pussy
there man, OK?

01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:56.510
She told me before she'll take
two, three guys at a time,

01:15:56.650 --> 01:15:57.710
Maybe we can share it?

01:15:57.850 --> 01:15:58.810
I never said that.

01:15:58.820 --> 01:16:00.380
I ain't riding a train.
That's not my style.

01:16:00.390 --> 01:16:01.650
You ride the train
with somebody else.

01:16:01.650 --> 01:16:03.150
If I'm gonna hit,
I hit by myself.

01:16:03.490 --> 01:16:04.950
You hit by yourself, no train.

01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:06.160
You guys are fucking crazy.

01:16:06.660 --> 01:16:08.890
Christ!
OK, Jésus...

01:16:09.590 --> 01:16:11.530
I got a proposition for you.

01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:13.660
You have till I get back from
taking care of some business

01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:14.930
to work your charms.

01:16:14.930 --> 01:16:18.430
If you can't work it, then
you're just have to wait your
turn.

01:16:18.570 --> 01:16:20.840
Are you willing
to take that wager?

01:16:25.110 --> 01:16:26.010
You know what?

01:16:26.310 --> 01:16:28.040
Watch a player play.
I got this.

01:16:28.380 --> 01:16:29.380
Great!

01:16:29.510 --> 01:16:30.780
Everyone's having a good time.

01:16:30.910 --> 01:16:32.010
Beautiful.

01:16:33.750 --> 01:16:34.680
Now...

01:16:35.420 --> 01:16:36.690
you two...

01:16:37.550 --> 01:16:38.620
play nice.

01:16:48.930 --> 01:16:50.630
Wait, wait, hold on, baby.

01:16:50.770 --> 01:16:53.500
Come on. Where you going?

01:16:54.370 --> 01:16:56.170
I saw how you was teasing me.
Chill out, baby.

01:16:56.510 --> 01:16:59.980
Jésus, I'm sorry, I was just
being friendly with you.

01:17:00.510 --> 01:17:01.980
- But you're not my type.
- Wait, wait...

01:17:02.310 --> 01:17:03.010
Not your type?

01:17:03.010 --> 01:17:05.080
How do you know I'm not your
type if you haven't even tried
me first?

01:17:06.450 --> 01:17:07.780
Is it that whiteboy you after?

01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:09.950
Get off me!
That's enough Jésus, get off me!

01:17:13.820 --> 01:17:15.590
Nicholas can't give you what
I'm about to show you.

01:17:15.730 --> 01:17:18.490
- This dick is one in a billion.
- Stop it! Stop it!

01:17:18.860 --> 01:17:19.860
Fuck!

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:21.560
What the fuck you trying to do?

01:17:21.700 --> 01:17:24.170
Wait till you feel my type!
100% Dominicano!

01:17:26.540 --> 01:17:27.840
You told me
you like this shit dirty.

01:17:27.970 --> 01:17:30.410
I know you European girls
like it dirty, now we going raw!

01:17:30.540 --> 01:17:31.940
Get off me! Fuck off!

01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:34.180
In life,
you either fuck or get fucked!

01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:36.080
Now, I'm doing the fucking!

01:17:39.850 --> 01:17:40.720
Fuck off.

01:17:40.850 --> 01:17:41.980
Fuck! Are you crazy?

01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:43.650
Stay away from me.

01:17:43.790 --> 01:17:45.620
Watch where you point that.

01:17:47.690 --> 01:17:49.060
You don't fucking know me!

01:17:49.390 --> 01:17:52.090
I fucked up niggas
three times your size in jail!

01:17:52.430 --> 01:17:54.630
So I suggest
you put that shit down!

01:17:54.770 --> 01:17:55.130
Stay away!

01:18:19.690 --> 01:18:20.990
Help me, please!

01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:37.540
Hey...

01:18:37.710 --> 01:18:38.710
Lovebirds.

01:18:54.930 --> 01:18:56.430
Signe?

01:18:59.630 --> 01:19:00.660
Signe!

01:19:05.670 --> 01:19:07.740
Call 9-1-1. I don't wanna die.

01:19:08.910 --> 01:19:09.970
Oh shit.

01:19:13.310 --> 01:19:14.580
Shit!

01:19:16.450 --> 01:19:16.910
Fuck!

01:21:22.070 --> 01:21:23.410
Sorry.

01:21:51.970 --> 01:21:54.140
Nicholas, it's me.

01:21:55.110 --> 01:21:58.410
I did it. It's done.
I got what you want.

01:21:58.540 --> 01:22:00.910
Now I want what we agreed on.

01:22:03.410 --> 01:22:04.710
Where do we meet?

01:22:30.710 --> 01:22:31.910
Huh-Huh...

01:22:36.750 --> 01:22:38.780
Nicholas Feinman...

01:22:41.350 --> 01:22:42.150
Hey Nick.

01:22:43.550 --> 01:22:44.820
You like movies?

01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:47.660
Cause...

01:22:47.860 --> 01:22:49.530
I got a movie today.

01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:56.900
Watch it!

01:22:57.470 --> 01:22:59.400
Watch the whole fucking thing.

01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:03.640
He's begging you for his life.

01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:06.910
That bitch shot him.

01:23:07.010 --> 01:23:09.040
And you put him in the ground.

01:23:09.310 --> 01:23:11.050
That's ten grand.

01:23:11.380 --> 01:23:13.620
You can have it,
no questions asked.

01:23:14.950 --> 01:23:16.690
Don't worry, Nicholas,

01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:18.920
I'm taking your money.

01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:21.090
But first you and I,

01:23:21.460 --> 01:23:22.960
we're gonna party.

01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:25.630
You like cocaine?

01:23:28.430 --> 01:23:29.800
Open it.

01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:33.700
Open it!

01:23:42.380 --> 01:23:43.480
Now take a hit.

01:23:45.880 --> 01:23:48.150
I said take a motherfucking hit.

01:23:54.590 --> 01:23:55.960
Now take another one.

01:23:58.030 --> 01:23:59.500
I don't want to take
another one.

01:23:59.630 --> 01:24:00.700
I ain't asking you.

01:24:03.370 --> 01:24:05.700
You like to party
like a rockstar, whiteboy?

01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:06.600
Do you?

01:24:06.740 --> 01:24:08.900
We're gonna party all night.

01:24:09.070 --> 01:24:12.570
Yeah, you're gonna do that
whole motherfucking brick.

01:24:21.950 --> 01:24:22.990
Alright.

01:24:28.630 --> 01:24:29.490
Faster!

01:24:33.530 --> 01:24:34.960
Bottoms the fuck up!

01:25:12.740 --> 01:25:14.500
Get your stuff together.

01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:16.840
Amir's gonna get you
out of here.

01:25:20.910 --> 01:25:22.040
So you believe me?

01:25:22.380 --> 01:25:23.780
I never said that.

01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:27.680
What Jésus said to you
about in life,

01:25:27.820 --> 01:25:30.550
you either fuck or get fucked.

01:25:31.650 --> 01:25:32.860
He said that to me too.

01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:37.660
Who wants to live like that?

01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:40.530
I don't.

01:25:42.630 --> 01:25:44.970
But the truth is,
people like us,

01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:46.940
people like me,

01:25:49.470 --> 01:25:50.740
we're all a little fucked.

01:25:54.540 --> 01:25:56.380
So you're going back
to Stockholm.

01:25:56.510 --> 01:25:58.780
The ticket's
under your real name.

01:26:00.020 --> 01:26:03.150
August, hey,
I'm sorry I lied about the fire.

01:26:03.490 --> 01:26:04.690
But the rest was true,

01:26:04.820 --> 01:26:06.420
he really did
those things to me.

01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:08.520
I can't go back, if I go...

01:26:08.660 --> 01:26:09.530
Get your stuff together.

01:26:09.530 --> 01:26:10.860
If I go back,
I go back to jail!

01:26:10.990 --> 01:26:12.760
Put your stuff together now.

01:26:15.060 --> 01:26:17.630
Signe, either get on the plane,

01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:20.070
or we go see Angel.

01:26:28.340 --> 01:26:29.880
No, no, no...

01:26:30.380 --> 01:26:34.020
Remember, no eating until
the whole family together.

01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:37.990
That brother of yours!

01:26:38.420 --> 01:26:41.060
How come he no show up again?

01:26:43.530 --> 01:26:44.660
Angel!

01:26:45.060 --> 01:26:45.990
Abuela...

01:27:01.950 --> 01:27:03.810
Oh, Dios mío...

01:27:23.730 --> 01:27:25.430
So this is it?

01:27:29.010 --> 01:27:29.840
Yeah.

01:27:32.740 --> 01:27:34.810
How do you know
I'm gonna get on the plane?

01:27:37.410 --> 01:27:38.880
Cause you can't cheat
what's coming.

01:27:42.050 --> 01:27:45.590
I don't want to be just the kind
of person you think I am.

01:27:45.890 --> 01:27:47.020
I said...

01:27:48.460 --> 01:27:50.830
more things
that you don't understand.

01:27:52.060 --> 01:27:54.560
Like what, Signe?

01:27:55.900 --> 01:27:56.770
Like what?

01:28:22.090 --> 01:28:23.830
Happy Fourth of July.

01:28:35.970 --> 01:28:39.040
At the end of it all,
even though I still felt lost,

01:28:39.340 --> 01:28:41.840
I realize now that the things
that change you,

01:28:41.980 --> 01:28:44.150
are never the ones
you see coming.

01:28:44.480 --> 01:28:47.380
They blind-side you
when you're most vulnerable.

01:28:49.390 --> 01:28:50.650
I look back and wonder why

01:28:50.650 --> 01:28:53.160
I was never aware of how much
anger I had inside me,

01:28:53.490 --> 01:28:55.860
how much fear and selfishness,

01:28:56.090 --> 01:28:59.460
and then I felt like
my heart was gonna explode.

01:29:04.900 --> 01:29:07.740
I'm sorry for a lot of things
I said and did,

01:29:07.870 --> 01:29:09.470
things I have to live with now,

01:29:09.610 --> 01:29:11.510
for the rest of my life.

01:29:11.640 --> 01:29:13.440
No way to fix it all.

01:29:13.540 --> 01:29:15.540
I did the best I could
at the time.

01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:17.150
But I still feel restless.

01:29:17.480 --> 01:29:19.950
So I let my mind wander again.

01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:28.960
In those moments, I confronted
myself for the first time.

01:29:29.790 --> 01:29:31.490
No more excuses.

01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:36.670
No more hang-ups
on chance and faith.

01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:41.600
All that was left was
facing the hard truth.

01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:45.640
There always will be
possibility.

01:29:46.740 --> 01:29:49.510
But it was up to us
to find our way.

01:29:52.780 --> 01:29:54.580
We had to do better.

01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:01.790
I had to do better.

01:30:02.305 --> 01:30:08.155
