00:31.400 --> 00:33.200
I'm not thinking about it, I'm doing it.

00:33.267 --> 00:35.634
I'm leaving to go back to university

00:35.701 --> 00:40.601
to learn about more than the price of opti-bright laser copy paper, you know.

00:40.667 --> 00:43.200
-298 a gram. -240 a gram. Check the list.

00:43.267 --> 00:44.601
Yeah, I thought you said something different.

00:44.667 --> 00:47.534
-What are you going to study? -Psychology.

00:47.601 --> 00:49.300
Why do you want to be a psychiatrist for?

00:49.367 --> 00:50.934
They're all mad themselves, aren't they?

00:51.000 --> 00:52.367
I want to be a psychologist.

00:52.434 --> 00:54.367
Same difference. All right then, Einstein.

00:54.434 --> 00:56.167
If you're so clever, what am I thinking about now?

00:56.234 --> 00:59.834
You're thinking, "How could I kill a tiger armed only with a biro?"

00:59.901 --> 01:01.400
-No. -No?

01:01.467 --> 01:03.500
You're thinking, "If I crash-land in a jungle,

01:03.567 --> 01:05.567
"will I be able to eat my own shoes?"

01:05.634 --> 01:08.367
-No, and you can't. -Right. What are you thinking, Gareth?

01:08.434 --> 01:11.534
I was just wondering, "Will there ever be a boy born

01:27.367 --> 01:29.701
Oh, midday. Are you just getting in?

01:29.767 --> 01:31.601
No. I should be here in about an hour.

01:31.667 --> 01:38.801
(SNIGGERS) About an hour. You're already here. I get it.

01:38.868 --> 01:41.267
Who am I, then, Dixon of Dock Green?

01:41.334 --> 01:44.000
-What? -Evening, all.

01:44.067 --> 01:45.968
-Brilliant. -Sorry I'm late.

01:46.033 --> 01:49.467
Yeah. Not so worried about that, but while you're lodging with me,

01:49.534 --> 01:52.667
your parents have entrusted me with their most valuable possession.

01:52.734 --> 01:53.901
You.

01:53.968 --> 01:56.868
Yeah? Ipso facto,

01:56.934 --> 02:01.934
trust received, responsibility given and taken.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.300
Yeah?

02:03.367 --> 02:06.000
I'm your guardian. You stayed out all night.

02:06.067 --> 02:08.601
Okay. You stayed with a friend, that's fine.

02:08.667 --> 02:10.534
I'm a little bit annoyed at her parents for not calling me...

02:10.601 --> 02:12.934
-His parents weren't in. -His parents. It's a bloke, so what?

02:13.000 --> 02:17.100
Come on. God. Chill out, shall we, please?

02:20.234 --> 02:22.467
-I could stay at Dawn's. -No, you couldn't.

02:22.534 --> 02:25.000
I could if I got off with... At the wrong...

02:25.067 --> 02:27.500
Got off at the wrong bus stop.

02:27.567 --> 02:29.434
I could, you know, I'd be on the floor...

02:29.500 --> 02:31.100
Yeah. We spent some time on the floor.

02:31.167 --> 02:33.500
For a good reason...

02:33.567 --> 02:34.467
probably.

02:34.534 --> 02:35.901
More room.

02:35.968 --> 02:39.667
Just go free. Come on. Jesus. You know.

02:39.734 --> 02:42.167
-But if I did stay at Dawn's... -Which you couldn't.

02:42.234 --> 02:43.767
You could stay at mine if you wanted.

02:43.834 --> 02:45.801
DAVID: I don't want to stay at yours.

02:45.868 --> 02:48.334
The point is if I did stay at Dawn's,

02:49.500 --> 02:51.033
there'd be no funny business.

02:51.100 --> 02:52.868
There was no funny business, fine.

02:52.934 --> 02:54.100
Apart from all the sex, but we'll do it at your place next time

02:54.167 --> 02:56.000
so you don't have to worry.

02:57.567 --> 02:59.868
It wasn't anyone in the office, was it?

02:59.934 --> 03:01.300
It was, actually.

03:01.367 --> 03:03.167
I slept with somebody in the office, everybody!

03:03.234 --> 03:06.901

03:06.968 --> 03:08.601
Don't even... It's not that...

03:08.667 --> 03:09.734
Oh.

03:13.067 --> 03:14.834
Oh.

03:14.901 --> 03:16.434
I'd let you stay at mine.

03:34.567 --> 03:36.901
-And Karen Roper. -Mr Brent.

03:36.968 --> 03:39.133
I don't know a Mr Brent. David.

03:40.367 --> 03:42.133
She'll brighten up the place, won't she?

03:42.200 --> 03:43.400
If she gets the job. So will he.

03:43.467 --> 03:45.767
If he gets it. Because you're both equal.

03:45.834 --> 03:50.767
So we're on the no foregone conclusion, based on interview and merit.

03:50.834 --> 03:53.601
I mean, it is up to me, ultimately, but good luck.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.467
-Right, I'll just check with Lee. -Yeah, absolutely. Of course.

12:54.300 --> 12:56.868
-Gareth. -All right?

12:56.934 --> 12:58.701
Gareteo. How are you, mate?

13:00.968 --> 13:02.500
Nothing. Good to see you.

13:04.300 --> 13:05.567
(TIM CLEARS THROAT)

13:10.734 --> 13:13.334
You weren't trying to get off with her, were you?

13:19.834 --> 13:23.868
Okay. Welcome to Wernham Hogg Health and Safety Training

13:23.934 --> 13:26.667
with Gareth Keenan. Okay?

13:26.734 --> 13:29.300
That's me. Pleased to meet you.

13:31.100 --> 13:33.868
There are many hidden dangers in the workspace,

13:33.934 --> 13:36.033
and today we're going to find out what those dangers are

13:36.100 --> 13:37.334
together, all right?

13:37.400 --> 13:40.801
Starting off with your workstation.

13:40.868 --> 13:45.167
Now, I want you to imagine that this is a mug of hot coffee.

13:45.234 --> 13:46.968
It's not, okay,

13:47.033 --> 13:49.734
because that would be dangerous even in a training situation.

13:49.801 --> 13:55.200
What we're going to do is play a little fun game that I've made up.

13:55.267 --> 13:58.200
All right? I like to have a bit of fun when I'm teaching people.

13:58.267 --> 14:01.434
In fact, I like to have a laugh most of the time, in and out of work.

14:01.500 --> 14:03.267
In fact, there's a few of us going out tonight...

14:03.334 --> 14:04.601
Shall we crack on?

14:06.534 --> 14:10.634
Good. Keen. Excellent. All right.

14:10.701 --> 14:13.734
Now, watch where I place this mug

14:13.801 --> 14:19.167
in order to simulate where someone might put a mug in real life.

14:19.234 --> 14:24.567
What I want you to do is shout out, and shout, mind, "safe" or "dangerous".

14:24.634 --> 14:27.868
All right? Think you can manage that?

14:29.133 --> 14:30.567
Okay. Let's go.

14:36.100 --> 14:37.400
Dangerous.

14:55.901 --> 14:57.934
Dangerous.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.300
So, what have we learnt there?

14:59.367 --> 15:01.267
Don't pour coffee over the computer?

15:01.334 --> 15:04.100
Any fluids. Right? Good.

15:05.167 --> 15:07.334
First-class, Dawn.

15:07.400 --> 15:08.801
-You all right? -Eh?

15:08.868 --> 15:11.601
-You all right? -Yeah, yeah. Fine, thanks.

15:11.667 --> 15:13.734
Have you had a good morning or a bad morning?

15:13.801 --> 15:18.100
A bit of a... (LAUGHS) Oh, God, a bit of a mad morning.

15:18.167 --> 15:20.534
-Never mind. -See you later.

15:20.601 --> 15:21.400
Okay.

15:24.000 --> 15:27.767
Basically, there's a correct way and an incorrect way to lift stuff.

15:27.834 --> 15:30.234
All right? This is the incorrect way.

15:35.167 --> 15:37.601
Okay? Incorrect.

15:37.667 --> 15:39.400
The correct way, two things to remember.

15:39.467 --> 15:42.133
First of all, keep your back nice and straight. Straight back.

15:42.200 --> 15:44.067
-And then... -And bend your knees.

15:44.133 --> 15:47.968
You got to keep your back straight and bend your knees. All right?

15:48.033 --> 15:50.467
Very important.

15:50.534 --> 15:54.901
-Do you want to try that with me? -I'm fine.

15:54.968 --> 15:59.167
Well, I'm supposed to witness you do it so I can tick the box. So...

15:59.234 --> 16:00.901
Just do it with me a couple of times.

16:01.100 --> 16:05.000
All right? So, nice straight back, bend your knees...

16:07.000 --> 16:09.434
Up. That's it.

16:09.500 --> 16:11.734
Down again. Same on the way down as on the way up.

16:27.133 --> 16:28.434
Down again.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.300
Good. One more time.

16:31.367 --> 16:33.701
Nice, straight back. That's it.

16:33.767 --> 16:35.234
That's it. Great.

16:35.300 --> 16:38.534
One more time. That's it. So, you got that?

16:38.601 --> 16:40.200
I'll practise it at home.

16:40.267 --> 16:43.033
Excellent. Good. Well done.

16:43.100 --> 16:44.968
If there's any questions you want to ask,

16:45.033 --> 16:48.834
or if you want to talk about anything at all, just come and see...

16:48.901 --> 16:51.033
I know you've, um...

16:51.100 --> 16:53.434
-I know you slept with... -Are we done, then?

16:53.500 --> 16:55.467
-You made a mistake, that's fine. -I haven't made a mistake.

16:55.534 --> 16:58.300
I was just checking whether you're going to be sleeping with him again or no.

16:58.367 --> 17:00.400
-Spreading it around... -Right. Bye.

17:04.667 --> 17:05.601
Good. Good.

17:07.500 --> 17:08.834
Yeah.

17:08.901 --> 17:11.801
Excellent pupil. Fast learner.

17:11.868 --> 17:17.934
She won't be spilling any fluids or lifting things incorrectly.

17:18.133 --> 17:20.133
A, I'm going to give her.

17:21.467 --> 17:22.300
A.

17:25.734 --> 17:26.701
(TAPPING KEYBOARD)

17:29.367 --> 17:30.901
Hi, Gareth. Quick question, mate.

17:30.968 --> 17:33.367
I've got these invoices to file and I don't know...

17:33.434 --> 17:34.734
(CONTINUES TYPING)

17:50.267 --> 17:51.934
-Yes? -Where do I file these?

17:52.133 --> 17:53.901
-I don't know. -Excellent. Thanks.

17:56.601 --> 17:57.701
Who am I?

17:58.868 --> 18:00.901
(LAUGHS) I don't know.

18:00.968 --> 18:02.434
Indiana Jones.

18:03.567 --> 18:06.701
(CONTINUE TALKING, INDISTINCT)

18:06.767 --> 18:09.500
GARETH: It's not as if she's your daughter or anything.

18:09.567 --> 18:12.067
No. But, that's not the point. It's the principle.

18:12.133 --> 18:13.567
It was about respect.

18:13.634 --> 18:15.601
Yeah. Showing a bit of respect.

18:19.200 --> 18:23.234
And while she's under my roof, she will obey my laws. So...

18:23.300 --> 18:26.500
Showing respect by obeying the law.

18:28.200 --> 18:30.100
-She's legal, though. -What?

18:30.167 --> 18:31.934
When cherries are red, they're ready for plucking,

18:32.000 --> 18:33.801
-when girls are 16, they're ready for... -Gareth.

18:33.868 --> 18:36.100
-You heard that one, then. -Well...

18:36.167 --> 18:39.767
So, are you going to fire the person she shag...slept with?

18:39.834 --> 18:43.167
It's a free country. I can't do anything about it. So...

18:43.234 --> 18:45.601
So, you won't fire them, as such?

18:45.667 --> 18:47.567
I won't look on him favourably, let's put it that way.

18:47.634 --> 18:50.000
Or her. Or her. It could be a girl.

18:50.067 --> 18:52.400
She's not a lesbian, Gareth.

18:52.467 --> 18:56.000
I think I'd know if a woman living under my roof

18:56.067 --> 18:58.434
liked to roll around with other women.

19:02.467 --> 19:04.100
Gareth? Don't you?

19:06.267 --> 19:09.300
Yep. Most probably.

19:09.367 --> 19:10.467
-Spoke to you at 5:00, yeah? -DAVID: Yeah.

19:10.534 --> 19:12.434
Get the call at 6:00 from the lads,

19:12.500 --> 19:14.567
drinks at 8:00 in the Chasers.

19:14.634 --> 19:16.934
-Spare bird going. -Not for long!

19:17.000 --> 19:20.534
So I get there, she's aged 19. Ferrari chassis,

19:20.601 --> 19:24.000
fantastic-sized shelves and legs up to her arse.

19:24.067 --> 19:26.901
Muchos tequilas later, I'm in a cab with her.

19:26.968 --> 19:29.033
-Not only that... -Oh, dear.

19:29.100 --> 19:31.000
...but me mate's bird wants to get a lift with me and this nympho.

19:31.067 --> 19:32.601
DAVID: Oh, God, Finchy!

19:32.667 --> 19:34.200
So there I am, back of the cab,

19:34.267 --> 19:36.000
both of them got their laughing gear

19:36.067 --> 19:38.601
round the old single-barrel pump-action yogurt rifle, yeah?

19:38.667 --> 19:39.601
(BOTH LAUGHING)

19:39.667 --> 19:41.701
-His knob. -FINCH: So, back to mine,

19:41.767 --> 19:43.534
two hours sleep, yeah?

19:43.601 --> 19:46.100
Today, I bump into the mate whose bird I've done.

19:46.167 --> 19:49.567
-Ooh! -Sold him two tonne of high white wove.

19:49.634 --> 19:51.734
And he says to me, he says, "Hey, you look knackered."

19:51.801 --> 19:53.534
And I'm thinking, "Yeah.

19:53.601 --> 19:55.367
"And you looks like you've had a Pot Noodle and a wank, mate."

19:55.434 --> 19:57.133
-And you said that to him? -Unbelievable.

19:57.200 --> 20:00.133
FINCH: I shit you not. I'm seeing both of them tomorrow night.

20:00.200 --> 20:02.500
Coming out tonight still, though? Wednesday night razz?

20:02.567 --> 20:03.968
Definitely.

20:04.033 --> 20:05.200
You coming, jobless?

20:05.267 --> 20:08.868
Yeah. If only for the conversation.

20:08.934 --> 20:12.901
-Oh. Pot Noodle and a wank! -The best wank.

20:12.968 --> 20:14.734
TIM: I don't know where we're going tonight.

20:14.801 --> 20:17.234
Obviously, Finchy's a sophisticated guy

20:17.300 --> 20:20.167
and Gareth's a culture vulture.

20:20.234 --> 20:22.767
So, will it be opera, ballet? I don't know.

20:24.033 --> 20:26.067
I know the RSC's in town, so...

20:26.133 --> 20:30.500
No, having said that, at Chasers it's a Hooch for a pound

20:30.567 --> 20:33.133
and Wonderbras-get-in-free night tonight, so...

20:33.200 --> 20:36.033
I don't know. I don't know who'll win. It's exciting. I'm staying out of it.

20:55.267 --> 20:59.067
Chris Finch, good to meet you. This is my very good friend Sir David Brent.

20:59.133 --> 21:00.500
Hiya.

21:00.567 --> 21:02.567
Joking. The only knighthood he's got is a condom.

21:02.634 --> 21:04.367
Knight hood.

21:04.434 --> 21:07.367
-Condom, sheath. -I'm saying the joke worked. Good.

21:07.434 --> 21:10.701
Condoms come in all different flavours now, don't they?

21:10.767 --> 21:13.901
Like strawberry and curry and that. Do you like curry?

21:17.367 --> 21:19.200
FINCH: Well, what are your names?

21:19.267 --> 21:21.167
I'm Lorna. This is Lindsey and Heather.

21:23.367 --> 21:24.500
-Nice to meet you. -Pleased to meet you.

21:24.567 --> 21:26.300
And very nice to meet you.

Well, you know what they say, "One up the bum, no harm done."

22:05.234 --> 22:07.000
-You never heard that before? -Yeah.

22:09.834 --> 22:11.500
Christ, that'll do.

-Leave it. -God, you lucky bastard.

22:22.100 --> 22:25.267
Don't. Do it to other girls. That's fine. Please, just...

22:37.434 --> 22:39.000
GARETH: Yeah, we go there every Wednesday night

22:39.067 --> 22:40.534
and it's a fun place,

22:40.601 --> 22:43.400
but it's full of loose women.

22:43.467 --> 22:46.701
And my only problem with that is venereal disease,

22:46.767 --> 22:49.467
which is disabilitating.

22:49.534 --> 22:52.901
Especially for a soldier.

22:52.968 --> 22:55.267
And it's irresponsible to the rest of your unit as well, all right?

22:55.334 --> 22:57.234
You've been under attack for days,

22:57.300 --> 23:01.133

-Lager? -Pint thereof.

They're coming up to me, one at a time, and they're going,

24:53.634 --> 24:56.300
It's got two nightclubs. You've got Chasers

24:56.367 --> 24:58.567
and New York, New York.

A themed nightclub called Henry VIII's, right?

25:10.067 --> 25:13.734
This was incredible. It had the Ann Boleyn Alley.

25:13.801 --> 25:16.067
This is true.

25:16.133 --> 25:20.334
As you went into the loo, there was a sign that said "Mind Your Head." Nice.

25:20.400 --> 25:23.534
And underneath someone had written "Don't get your Hampton Court."

I wouldn't even want him watching.

26:06.033 --> 26:07.934
No. No way.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.868
(TAINTED LOVE BY SOFT CELL PLAYING)

26:36.801 --> 26:38.634
DONNA: Hi.

26:38.701 --> 26:41.734
-Hey. All right, mate? -Good to see you, all right, yeah.

26:45.434 --> 26:48.400
-So now you know. -DAVID: Yeah, brilliant.

26:48.467 --> 26:50.234
What? You got a problem with Ricky?

26:50.300 --> 26:51.934
No. Sleep with everyone in the office.

26:52.000 --> 26:53.634
He's not even a permanent member of staff.

26:53.701 --> 26:54.968
I'd have preferred it if you slept with Gareth.

26:55.033 --> 26:56.467
Wouldn't happen.

26:56.534 --> 26:57.834
Oh, why? 'Cause he didn't go to university?

26:57.901 --> 27:00.267
No, because he's a little weasel-faced arse.

27:00.334 --> 27:01.634
Yeah, you could do worse than Gareth.

27:01.701 --> 27:04.267
He hasn't missed one day in this office from ill health.

27:04.334 --> 27:07.167
And don't call my second-in-command an arse-faced weasel.

27:07.234 --> 27:09.000
-A weasel-faced arse. -Same thing.

27:09.067 --> 27:10.968
Well, no, it's not. Would you rather have a face like an arse

27:11.033 --> 27:12.601
or a face like a weasel?

27:14.234 --> 27:15.868
A weasel, probably?

27:15.934 --> 27:18.667
Anyway, fuck this. Don't tell me who I can and can't see.

27:18.734 --> 27:20.300
I hope you're not going to sleep with a woman, David,

27:20.367 --> 27:22.601
'cause obviously you find sex so disgusting.

27:22.667 --> 27:24.868
Chance would be a fine thing. He couldn't pull in a brothel.

27:24.934 --> 27:26.467
I could and I have!

27:26.534 --> 27:28.133
And yes, I will take her home with me if I want.

27:28.200 --> 27:29.334
I don't want to come home with you.

27:29.400 --> 27:31.234
She doesn't want to come home with me.

27:31.300 --> 27:34.000
I don't want you to come home with me. That's a waste of an hour.

27:34.067 --> 27:36.701
So the only reason you've been talking to me is because you want to shag me?

27:36.767 --> 27:39.000
Yeah, and from behind, because your breath stinks of onions.

27:39.067 --> 27:40.701
And I didn't tell you that, did I?

27:40.767 --> 27:43.000
FINCH: Whoo! One up the bum, no harm done.

27:43.067 --> 27:44.901
No. Not up the arse.

27:53.934 --> 27:57.234
DAVID: This is the poem Slough by Sir John Betjeman.

27:57.300 --> 27:59.834
Probably never been here in his life.

27:59.901 --> 28:02.267
"Come friendly bombs and fall on Slough!

28:02.334 --> 28:03.934
"It isn't fit for humans now."

28:04.000 --> 28:07.133
Right, I don't think you solve town planning problems

28:07.200 --> 28:10.467
by dropping bombs all over the place, so he's embarrassed himself there. Next.

28:10.534 --> 28:13.334
Um... "In labour-saving homes, with care

28:13.400 --> 28:15.767
"Their wives frizz out peroxide hair

28:15.834 --> 28:18.801
"And dry it in synthetic air And paint their nails."

28:18.868 --> 28:19.901
They want to look nice.

28:20.100 --> 28:22.634
Why's he got a... Doesn't he like girls?

28:22.701 --> 28:26.901
"And talk of sports and makes of cars In various bogus-Tudor bars

28:26.968 --> 28:29.667
"And daren't look up and see the stars But belch instead."

28:29.734 --> 28:32.734
What's he on about? What, so he never burped?

28:32.801 --> 28:34.167
-Where are we going? -You just...

28:34.234 --> 28:35.767
TIM: What do you mean? I'm going home, mate.

28:35.834 --> 28:37.167
-No, one more drink. Don't be a poof. -No, I'm going home.

28:37.234 --> 28:38.300
-Come on, one more drink. -David...

28:38.367 --> 28:39.500
-One more drink. -David...

28:39.567 --> 28:41.767
-# Life, oh, life -Shut up. Shut up.

28:41.834 --> 28:44.400
# Oh, life, oh, life #

28:44.467 --> 28:45.968
TIM: Don't do that. DAVID: It's my favourite.

28:46.033 --> 28:48.100
DAVID: "Come, friendly bombs and fall on Slough

28:48.167 --> 28:49.634
"To get it ready for the plough.

28:49.701 --> 28:53.133
"The cabbages are coming now, the earth exhales."

28:53.200 --> 28:54.100
He's the only cabbage round here.

29:18.334 --> 29:20.701
And they made him a knight of the realm.

29:21.667 --> 29:22.667
Overrated.
