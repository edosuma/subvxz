WEBVTT

00:05.831 --> 00:08.660
- Order.
Order in the store.

00:11.141 --> 00:12.838
It's a--it's a judge thing.

00:12.882 --> 00:14.057
all: Ah.

00:14.101 --> 00:15.972
- Anyway,
our new district manager

00:16.016 --> 00:17.495
is gonna be visiting today

00:17.539 --> 00:19.976
so I've thrown together
some fun Halloween events.

00:20.020 --> 00:22.674
First, we're gonna be handing
out goodie bags to the kids.

00:22.718 --> 00:24.850
Uh, Sandra, can you take
the lead on that?

00:24.894 --> 00:26.156
- Yes.

00:26.200 --> 00:27.505
- Glenn and Garrett,
you two are gonna be managing

00:27.549 --> 00:30.204
the haunted house
in the garden center.

00:30.247 --> 00:32.597
- Aww, man, then I won't
get to hear Jonah lecture us

00:32.641 --> 00:34.773
on whatever dumb metaphor
his costume's supposed to be.

00:34.817 --> 00:37.167
- Uh, actually,
I got tired of explaining

00:37.211 --> 00:38.864
my costume every year,
so this year,

00:38.908 --> 00:41.128
I'm just gonna be
a good old-fashioned cowboy.

00:41.171 --> 00:42.694
- We get it.

00:42.738 --> 00:45.654
You're herding us to the polls
because no one here votes.

00:45.697 --> 00:47.264
- No, really, I'm--
- Don't be stupid.

00:47.308 --> 00:50.572
He's obviously toxic
American masculinity.

00:50.615 --> 00:52.095
- Actually, I--I like
that better.

00:52.139 --> 00:53.444
I'm switching to that.

00:53.488 --> 00:55.446
- Um, should we be
selling these?

00:55.490 --> 00:58.232
Didn't they just find another
cut-off foot right around here?

00:58.275 --> 00:59.711
- Oh, it's awful.

00:59.755 --> 01:02.540
I'm an empath so things like
that really affect me.

01:02.584 --> 01:05.021
- I just wish they would catch
the guy already.

01:05.065 --> 01:06.588
- Why are you assuming
it's a guy?

01:06.631 --> 01:09.112
Maybe St. Louis finally
has a female serial killer.

01:09.156 --> 01:11.071
- Oh, yeah.
About time.

01:11.114 --> 01:12.811
Uh, hello,
glass ceiling?

01:12.855 --> 01:13.943
Ya shattered.

01:13.986 --> 01:16.076
- Sorry I'm late.
Sorry.

01:16.119 --> 01:18.165
- Wow.

01:18.208 --> 01:19.557
- Hard to get in my car
in this thing,

01:19.601 --> 01:21.690
but guess who's winning
our costume contest?

01:21.733 --> 01:23.518
- Oh, by the way,

01:23.561 --> 01:25.737
there will be
no costume contest this year.

01:25.781 --> 01:26.999
- What?

01:27.043 --> 01:28.218
- Corporate didn't want
to approve

01:28.262 --> 01:29.915
another racial sensitivity
training.

01:29.959 --> 01:32.440
- TitaIrma spent an hour this
morning sewing me into this.

01:32.483 --> 01:34.094
- You're sewed into that?

01:34.137 --> 01:35.704
How are you gonna use
the bathroom?

01:35.747 --> 01:37.532
- There's actually a lot
of padding in here, so...

01:44.713 --> 01:47.019
- ♪ Find skeleton bones
outside on the pavement ♪

01:47.063 --> 01:50.066
♪ And torture chambers down
in the basement ♪

01:50.110 --> 01:51.676
- And we've done
a really good job

01:51.720 --> 01:53.983
of organizing employees
at other stores.

01:54.026 --> 01:55.811
- Oh, I pulled so many digits.

01:55.854 --> 01:57.160
- 'Cause you were in charge

01:57.204 --> 01:58.379
of getting everyone's
contact info.

01:58.422 --> 01:59.597
- Point is, we almost have

01:59.641 --> 02:01.512
enough cards signed
to unionize.

02:01.556 --> 02:03.949
This is great, guys.
We're gonna be a union.

02:06.604 --> 02:08.606
- Ooh, this sounds fun.

02:08.650 --> 02:10.869
Did Sayid reach
a new level of Pokémon?

02:10.913 --> 02:12.567
- My girlfriend made me quit.

02:12.610 --> 02:16.788
- We were just talking
about the u...nicorn union.

02:16.832 --> 02:18.790
No, just--just unicorns.

02:18.834 --> 02:21.619
- Um, you guys,
you know I'm pro-union.

02:21.663 --> 02:23.969
Why wouldn't you just tell me
about the meeting?

02:24.013 --> 02:27.147
- We quit telling you weeks ago
because you're management.

02:27.190 --> 02:28.931
I mean, she doesn't
need healthcare.

02:28.974 --> 02:31.281
She's got a drawer full
of Band-Aids in her desk.

02:31.325 --> 02:33.370
- Okay, I paid
for those Band-Aids,

02:33.414 --> 02:34.719
and they're for everybody.

02:34.763 --> 02:37.157
- Can I have one?
- Do you have a cut?

02:37.200 --> 02:39.550
- Ah, see?
There's always a catch.

02:39.594 --> 02:42.553
- Look, the union rep just said
that in order to be safe,

02:42.597 --> 02:44.164
we should probably keep
management

02:44.207 --> 02:45.643
at, like, you know,
a distance,

02:45.687 --> 02:48.777
and obviously you're not, like,
a "manager" manager

02:48.820 --> 02:51.649
or anything, but,
you know, still.

02:53.651 --> 02:55.087
- Oh, you want me to leave.

02:55.131 --> 02:56.480
- Obviously, I don't want that.

02:56.524 --> 02:58.221
I clearly--that's not--
- Really?

02:58.265 --> 03:00.180
'Cause it kinda seems
like you're trying to get me

03:00.223 --> 03:01.964
out of the door but--
- No, no, we're just trying...

03:02.007 --> 03:04.793
- Oh, my God, they're so cute
when they bicker.

03:04.836 --> 03:06.186
- No, no, we're not.
- We're--that's--

03:06.229 --> 03:07.839
- That's--no.

03:07.883 --> 03:09.363
- All right, go ahead.
Have fun in there.

03:09.406 --> 03:10.712
Don't steal anything.

03:13.018 --> 03:15.238
- It's my first Halloween
since the diabetes.

03:15.282 --> 03:17.327
- Mm.

03:17.371 --> 03:19.677
- You're so lucky you
don't have a family.

03:19.721 --> 03:23.725
You could eat yourself
to death and no one would care.

03:23.768 --> 03:25.553
I mean, it's okay.

03:25.596 --> 03:28.860
I guess I'll just be here
all day watching you eat that.

03:28.904 --> 03:31.254
- Works for me.

03:31.298 --> 03:33.256
- You know what?
- Oh!

03:33.300 --> 03:34.649
- I'm just gonna get rid of it,
you know,

03:34.692 --> 03:35.737
to save us from being tempted.
- What?

03:35.780 --> 03:37.913
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Whoa!

03:37.956 --> 03:41.482
- No, it's best for both of us,
not to mention this guy.

03:41.525 --> 03:44.049
- Hey, man,
don't touch my tummy!

03:44.093 --> 03:46.574
- Okay, Halloween question.

03:46.617 --> 03:49.664
If anyone in our store
was chopping off feet--

03:49.707 --> 03:51.056
- Glenn.

03:51.100 --> 03:53.145
Well, it's always the churchy
ones who snap first.

03:53.189 --> 03:55.278
- Really?
What about Garrett?

03:55.322 --> 03:57.280
'Cause, you know,
he's a sneaker guy

03:57.324 --> 03:58.934
and you know where people
keep their sneakers.

03:58.977 --> 04:00.892
- Glenn?
Garrett?

04:00.936 --> 04:02.285
Really?

04:02.329 --> 04:03.721
Did you see
those crime scene photos?

04:03.765 --> 04:05.245
That foot was a precision cut.

04:05.288 --> 04:06.768
I'm thinking
a reciprocating meat saw.

04:06.811 --> 04:08.900
- Oh, you've given this
foot chopper a lot of thought.

04:08.944 --> 04:10.728
- Oh, they're not just
cutting off feet.

04:10.772 --> 04:12.643
If you ask me, they're
dismembering whole bodies.

04:12.687 --> 04:14.079
Sure,
they're releasing the feet,

04:14.123 --> 04:16.256
but there's a trophy room
somewhere with heads,

04:16.299 --> 04:18.649
hands, and select genitals.

04:22.610 --> 04:26.875
- You don't think that, uh--
yeah, no.

04:26.918 --> 04:28.659
But do you?

04:28.703 --> 04:31.836
- What, that Dina's
a serial killer?

04:31.880 --> 04:33.838
No, no.

04:33.882 --> 04:35.579
I mean, that would be insane.
- Yeah.

04:35.623 --> 04:38.103
Oh, but also kinda.

04:38.147 --> 04:39.757
-  Right?

04:39.801 --> 04:42.107
- Well, I just hate having
to be so out of it,

04:42.151 --> 04:44.632
especially now that we're
so close to the finish line.

04:44.675 --> 04:47.722
It's like this union is my baby
and I don't even get

04:47.765 --> 04:49.419
to drop it off at college.

04:49.463 --> 04:51.639
- Our baby.
- Okay, yeah, sure.

04:51.682 --> 04:55.207
I mean, you help, obviously,
and I so appreciate it,

04:55.251 --> 04:57.297
and I love that you have
a connection with the baby.

04:57.340 --> 04:58.602
- Are we still talking
about the--

04:58.646 --> 05:00.474
- The union, yeah. Of course.
- Right, yeah.

05:00.517 --> 05:02.911
Look, it's--it's almost done.
You don't have to worry.

05:02.954 --> 05:05.217
I mean, I'm meeting
with somebody later today

05:05.261 --> 05:07.219
from Fenton to get the last
of the signed cards, and then--

05:07.263 --> 05:08.525
- Knock, knock.

05:08.569 --> 05:10.440
- Oh, hey.
Uh, new DM.

05:10.484 --> 05:11.702
- Yes.
Maya.

05:11.746 --> 05:12.703
- Jonah.
Hi, nice to meet you.

05:12.747 --> 05:13.965
- Hi, nice to meet you, too.

05:14.009 --> 05:15.967
- Amy was just telling me
about some

05:16.011 --> 05:18.883
of her favorite RBG dissents.
- Uh-huh.

05:18.927 --> 05:24.976
Yep, and I said all of them,
so dismissed.

05:25.020 --> 05:27.239
- Okay.

05:27.283 --> 05:29.111
- Amy Sosa.
So nice to meet you.

05:29.154 --> 05:30.373
- You, too.

05:30.417 --> 05:31.331
I just thought it would be
a fun day

05:31.374 --> 05:32.593
to come by and meet you guys

05:32.636 --> 05:34.072
now that I'm taking over
for Laurie.

05:34.116 --> 05:35.639
- Yeah, yeah.

05:35.683 --> 05:37.554
She--she left kind of suddenly,
huh?

05:37.598 --> 05:41.123
Did that have anything
to do with her, um...

05:41.166 --> 05:43.343
Her hobbies?
- You mean her coke habit?

05:43.386 --> 05:45.997
- Oh, um, I--wow. That--
- It's okay.

05:46.041 --> 05:47.782
We're all talking about it.
- Okay.

05:47.825 --> 05:49.740
- At the last retreat,
she was so coked up,

05:49.784 --> 05:52.177
she roundhouse kicked the CEO
into the omelet station.

05:52.221 --> 05:53.178
- No.
- Yeah.

05:54.441 --> 05:55.485
- Did anybody get
a video of that?

05:55.529 --> 05:56.573
- Girl, I wish!

05:58.445 --> 05:59.881
No, but seriously,
it's very sad.

05:59.924 --> 06:02.710
- Yeah, no, I really hope
she gets the help she needs.

06:05.800 --> 06:08.933
- Aww, I left my cell phone
in the garden center.

06:12.372 --> 06:15.200
- Well, I'm just
spitballing here,

06:15.244 --> 06:17.028
but maybe you could just go in
and get it?

06:17.072 --> 06:18.856
- Yeah.

06:18.900 --> 06:21.337
Haunted houses are
a little loaded for me.

06:21.381 --> 06:22.686
When I was a kid,

06:22.730 --> 06:25.341
my dad took me
to Skele-Tony's Spook Shack,

06:25.385 --> 06:27.822
and I accidentally let go
of his hand

06:27.865 --> 06:31.347
and I couldn't find my way out
for 45 minutes.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.349
I ended up eating
the spaghetti brains

06:33.393 --> 06:35.351
and grape eyeballs just
to survive.

06:35.395 --> 06:38.572
- So because of that
traumatic snack,

06:38.615 --> 06:40.791
you're too scared to go
into the garden center

06:40.835 --> 06:43.446
that we saw Elias decorate
with crepe paper?

06:43.490 --> 06:46.623
- No, no.
That'd be silly.

06:46.667 --> 06:48.059
Of course I can go in there.

06:48.103 --> 06:49.713
- Mm-hmm.

06:49.757 --> 06:50.975
- But you know what'd
be easier?

06:51.019 --> 06:53.543
I can check
my voicemail remotely.

06:53.587 --> 06:55.719
Go into the store,
use the phone,

06:55.763 --> 06:58.592
dial nine for an outside line,
call my cell phone,

06:58.635 --> 07:00.855
press star,
and then enter my password.

07:00.898 --> 07:02.247
Easy peasy.

07:02.291 --> 07:03.684
- Yeah.

07:09.690 --> 07:11.343
- I am Maya,
the new DM.

07:11.387 --> 07:13.084
- Hi, I'm Garrett.
Nice costume.

07:13.128 --> 07:14.869
- Yeah, we both know I just
threw on the first thing

07:14.912 --> 07:16.218
that I found in the store,
okay?

07:16.261 --> 07:17.567
-  Yeah.
Me, too.

07:17.611 --> 07:19.656
- Excuse me.

07:19.700 --> 07:21.353
- I mean,
that looks pretty elaborate.

07:21.397 --> 07:22.659
- Well, you know,
it was just sitting

07:22.703 --> 07:23.878
in the front of the store,
so I just grabbed it.

07:23.921 --> 07:26.184
- Um, could you excuse me
for just a minute?

07:26.228 --> 07:28.099
- And Crestwood came around--
- Hey!

07:28.143 --> 07:30.275
Hey, lady!

07:30.319 --> 07:32.582
- Hey!

07:32.626 --> 07:34.454
I saw you walk in
and I thought,

07:34.497 --> 07:35.977
"Is that Kelly?"

07:36.020 --> 07:38.109
'Cause Jonah mentioned
that someone from Fenton

07:38.153 --> 07:40.285
was coming to meet him,
but he didn't say who.

07:40.329 --> 07:43.593
- So yeah, Kelly brought the
union cards so we got Fenton!

07:43.637 --> 07:45.203
Yay!
- Whoo!

07:45.247 --> 07:47.858
- He also didn't mention that
this was gonna be happening

07:47.902 --> 07:49.947
in the store on the same day

07:49.991 --> 07:51.906
that our new district manager
is here,

07:51.949 --> 07:53.951
but I guess this
is your thing now

07:53.995 --> 07:56.780
and it's not really up to me
to make better choices.

07:56.824 --> 07:58.956
-  Hey, lady!
- Kelly!

07:59.000 --> 08:01.132
Hi.
-  Oh, hello!

08:01.176 --> 08:02.699
- Oh, no.

08:02.743 --> 08:04.614
You two are wearing
a couple's costume.

08:04.658 --> 08:06.094
both: Oh.

08:06.137 --> 08:07.617
- I guess it does, uh...
- Well, that's...

08:07.661 --> 08:08.923
...funny.
- Look like that.

08:08.966 --> 08:10.968
- Well, one of you definitely
has to change.

08:11.012 --> 08:14.102
Oh, Kelly, you can switch
costumes with Amy.

08:14.145 --> 08:16.670
Wait, no, that's not gonna work
because Amy's so much bigger.

08:16.713 --> 08:18.367
- Okay, Sandra, we're good
on the costumes.

08:18.410 --> 08:20.325
Thank you.

08:20.369 --> 08:22.066
It's just so funny
that Jonah never mentioned

08:22.110 --> 08:23.546
that you guys
are working together.

08:23.590 --> 08:25.766
- Um, yeah.
I guess I just--

08:25.809 --> 08:27.768
I didn't know
if it was--it'd be weird or--

08:27.811 --> 08:29.813
- Weird?
Why would it be weird?

08:29.857 --> 08:32.424
'Cause it's Kelly?
It's--it's Kelly.

08:32.468 --> 08:35.210
She's my--she's my lady.

08:35.253 --> 08:37.125
The only weird thing is
that you didn't tell me.

08:37.168 --> 08:38.518
- Well, it's not really,

08:38.561 --> 08:39.997
like, a big deal.
- Because I'm already so out of

08:40.041 --> 08:41.346
the loop with the union stuff.
- And plus it was like

08:41.390 --> 08:42.522
a few phone calls--
- So it's kind of a bummer

08:42.565 --> 08:43.348
to find out this way
that the two of you

08:43.392 --> 08:45.612
are raising my baby.

08:45.655 --> 08:49.616
- You guys, I am dying
right now.

08:52.009 --> 08:54.142
- Oh, wow.
You finally flipped Simon.

08:54.185 --> 08:56.361
- Yeah, I told him that thing
you said about union

08:56.405 --> 08:58.276
being spelled with U and I.

08:58.320 --> 09:00.757
- Oh, you mean the quote he got
from the pamphlet I gave him?

09:00.801 --> 09:02.411
- Here you are.

09:02.454 --> 09:03.586
- Hey.

09:03.630 --> 09:04.935
- Hi. I got to know some
of your people.

09:04.979 --> 09:05.980
- Huh.

09:06.023 --> 09:07.198
- Justine invited me

09:07.242 --> 09:08.591
to her erotic sip 'n' paint.

09:08.635 --> 09:10.288
- You don't want anything
to do with that.

09:10.332 --> 09:12.639
Kelly?

09:12.682 --> 09:15.380
Kelly, right?

09:15.424 --> 09:17.121
Yeah, I met you
at the Fenton store.

09:17.165 --> 09:19.559
- Uh, yeah.
I'm just...

09:19.602 --> 09:21.604
- She's here because...
- Well, uh...

09:21.648 --> 09:24.259
- They're dating.
- Oh, that's great.

09:24.302 --> 09:27.001
- Yeah, she comes over every
day and--and they have coffee.

09:27.044 --> 09:28.611
Aren't they cute?
- So cute.

09:28.655 --> 09:30.613
- Did you notice
their couples costumes?

09:30.657 --> 09:32.659
- Yep.
She's my cowgirl.

09:32.702 --> 09:35.226
- Ride 'em, cowgirl.

09:35.270 --> 09:38.490
I mean, like, ride a horse,
not Jonah.

09:38.534 --> 09:41.145
That would be inappropriate
for work.

09:41.189 --> 09:43.495
- Well, I was just about
to grab some coffee anyway.

09:43.539 --> 09:44.932
Why don't we all go?

09:44.975 --> 09:48.239
It's on me.
- That would be so fun.

09:48.283 --> 09:50.154
-  So fun.

09:57.379 --> 09:59.816
- Glenn, do you want me
to go in and get your phone?

09:59.860 --> 10:01.862
- I mean, if you're going
in there anyway--

10:01.905 --> 10:03.515
-  Sure. Okay.

10:07.737 --> 10:09.478
- Haunted house.
Already been in there a ton.

10:09.521 --> 10:11.611
Sick of it.

10:13.830 --> 10:16.528
Oh, thank God.
How was it?

10:16.572 --> 10:18.269
-  It was pretty cool.

10:18.313 --> 10:20.663
- Are you crying blood?

10:20.707 --> 10:23.187
- Huh?

10:23.231 --> 10:24.841
Huh.

10:24.885 --> 10:26.756
Yeah, I guess I am.

10:26.800 --> 10:28.149
I'm sure it has nothing to do

10:28.192 --> 10:30.281
with what I just saw
or experienced.

10:32.283 --> 10:34.677
Elias did a great job
with the crepe paper, though.

10:34.721 --> 10:36.766
- D--did you find my phone?

10:36.810 --> 10:39.726
- I--
- Never mind.

10:42.729 --> 10:44.861
- So okay, St. Louis talk.

10:44.905 --> 10:47.516
What's this toasted ravioli
everyone's talking about?

10:47.559 --> 10:49.561
- Mmm, T-ravs.
They are great.

10:49.605 --> 10:50.693
You gotta try 'em.

10:50.737 --> 10:51.999
- You should go to Stephano's.

10:52.042 --> 10:54.044
Kelly and I used to go
all the time

10:54.088 --> 10:58.570
and--and still do,
you know, past and present.

10:58.614 --> 11:00.355
- Oh, I've never even heard
of the place.

11:00.398 --> 11:01.704
Which, I mean, makes sense.

11:01.748 --> 11:03.532
There's so much Jonah
doesn't tell me.

11:03.575 --> 11:07.710
- Uh, Kelly does a great,
uh, Stephano impersonation.

11:07.754 --> 11:10.670
- Oh.
All right.

11:10.713 --> 11:12.715
He's like, um,

11:12.759 --> 11:14.499
"Oh, our toasted ravioli's

11:14.543 --> 11:16.066
been written up
in the pay-per."

11:17.589 --> 11:19.591
And that's it.

11:19.635 --> 11:21.637
Uh, when you do go,

11:21.681 --> 11:23.160
um, you should try out
this gelato place

11:23.204 --> 11:24.640
about a block away.
- Yeah.

11:24.684 --> 11:27.556
- Wow, a second stop
on one date.

11:27.599 --> 11:29.863
Who's got that kind of time,
right?

11:29.906 --> 11:31.691
- Well, when you don't have
kids to come home to, y--

11:31.734 --> 11:35.346
not that having kids is,
uh, bad.

11:35.390 --> 11:37.566
That's--I--I actually wish

11:37.609 --> 11:40.612
I were dating someone
with kids.

11:40.656 --> 11:42.223
- I love this.

11:42.266 --> 11:44.225
You can see why
I come here every day.

11:45.922 --> 11:48.664
- My bad.
I got it.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.100
Oops.

11:50.144 --> 11:53.103
Let me just--excuse me, sir.
You're good, you're good.

11:53.147 --> 11:55.236
- Okay, there's no way Dina's
a serial killer.

11:55.279 --> 11:57.499
She's head of security.
Rules are her life.

11:57.542 --> 12:00.937
- Yeah, and "don't kill" is,
like, such a big rule.

12:00.981 --> 12:02.983
- Plus, she's a vegan, okay?

12:03.026 --> 12:04.854
She doesn't even kill to eat,
which is insane,

12:04.898 --> 12:06.508
because I would totally eat
a lamb alive.

12:06.551 --> 12:07.814
- You're right.

12:07.857 --> 12:09.946
She's the last person
who'd be a serial killer.

12:12.340 --> 12:15.952
Although, it is always the
last person who you'd think.

12:24.613 --> 12:27.703
- ♪ In your head

12:27.747 --> 12:31.272
♪ In your head, zombie

12:31.315 --> 12:33.056
- This has been great.
You have a really fun store.

12:33.100 --> 12:34.318
And you two,
hit me up

12:34.362 --> 12:35.798
for the next Stephano's trip,
okay?

12:35.842 --> 12:37.060
- Oh, absolutely.
- Will do.

12:37.104 --> 12:39.846
- Okay, bye-bye.
- Bye.

12:41.151 --> 12:43.458
- So many other reasons I could
have been in this store.

12:43.501 --> 12:46.026
- Sorry. It's the first thing
that came to my mind,

12:46.069 --> 12:48.419
and you're the ones wearing
the same clothes.

12:48.463 --> 12:50.813
- Look, the most important
thing is that at least--

12:50.857 --> 12:52.728
wait, where are the cards?

12:52.772 --> 12:54.425
- Oh, I hid them in one
of those orange bags

12:54.469 --> 12:57.167
when Maya came in.
- You mean the goodie bags?

12:57.211 --> 13:00.127
- There's enough for everyone.
Just form a line.

13:00.170 --> 13:02.216
Where are your parents?

13:04.653 --> 13:07.308
- It's just a garden center.
It's just a garden center.

13:07.351 --> 13:09.049
Just walking into
the garden center.

13:10.964 --> 13:12.835
Pardon me, sir.

13:12.879 --> 13:14.837
Are you Glenn Sturgis?

13:14.881 --> 13:17.057
- Yeah.
Why?

13:17.100 --> 13:21.888
- They told me to tell you:
don't go in there.

13:21.931 --> 13:24.151
-  Who said don't--

13:24.194 --> 13:26.109
who said that do you?

13:26.153 --> 13:27.676
- Glenn, who you talking to?

13:27.719 --> 13:31.593
- Th--this boy, did you--
he said that I had to--

13:34.901 --> 13:36.337
- What's going on, dude?

13:36.380 --> 13:38.165
- Yeah, I think I'm gonna head
to my car

13:38.208 --> 13:40.994
and read my Bible for a bit.

13:44.780 --> 13:45.999
- Great job.

13:46.042 --> 13:47.261
Didn't ask for the accent,
though.

13:47.304 --> 13:49.306
- It was a swing.
I thought it worked.

13:50.699 --> 13:52.744
- You already gave out
all the bags?

13:52.788 --> 13:54.616
- They were out of control.

13:54.659 --> 13:56.009
I said one per kid,
but Amy,

13:56.052 --> 13:57.488
some took two.

13:57.532 --> 13:59.926
- Hey, uh, let me see
what's in that bag, please.

13:59.969 --> 14:01.753
- No way!
You're, like, 40!

14:01.797 --> 14:03.277
Buy your own candy!

14:03.320 --> 14:05.583
- Hey, that kind of aggression
is exactly why people

14:05.627 --> 14:08.369
are turning on your sport.
Soccer is coming for you!

14:08.412 --> 14:09.849
- Okay. Thank you so much.
Yeah.

14:09.892 --> 14:11.241
- Why are you checking bags?

14:11.285 --> 14:15.245
- Um, because--okay,
here's the deal.

14:15.289 --> 14:16.812
The push for the union
never really stopped,

14:16.856 --> 14:19.249
and so the cards from Fenton
ended up in these goodie bags

14:19.293 --> 14:20.729
and they've all been
given away.

14:20.772 --> 14:23.471
- Oh, wow.
Well, listen.

14:23.514 --> 14:25.299
Company policy states
that I need to report

14:25.342 --> 14:27.040
any union activity
to my manager,

14:27.083 --> 14:28.780
so there's been union activity.

14:28.824 --> 14:29.956
Now that my hands are clean,

14:29.999 --> 14:31.087
I'll go check
the security footage.

14:31.131 --> 14:32.523
- Amazing.
Thank you, Dina.

14:32.567 --> 14:34.221
- Oh, hey, Kelly.

14:34.264 --> 14:36.571
Couple's costume with Jonah?
That's a weird choice.

14:36.614 --> 14:38.486
- It's not a couple's costume.
- It's a coincidence.

14:38.529 --> 14:40.792
- Okay.

14:40.836 --> 14:44.927
- ♪ Dracula was putting on
moon tan lotion ♪

14:44.971 --> 14:47.321
♪ Gnarly dude is what the--

14:47.974 --> 14:49.105
- Hey, Cheyenne,
I need help

14:49.149 --> 14:50.498
going over
some security footage.

14:50.541 --> 14:51.978
- Oh, okay.

14:52.021 --> 14:53.805
No, you have a child.

14:53.849 --> 14:54.981
I'll go, Dina.

14:55.024 --> 14:56.112
- You don't work
for me anymore.

14:56.156 --> 14:57.897
Cheyenne, come on.

14:57.940 --> 14:59.420
- Let me just call
Bo really quick.

14:59.463 --> 15:01.944
You know,
not to say good-bye or anything

15:01.988 --> 15:05.556
but just to say hey
and good-bye and stuff.

15:07.515 --> 15:11.214
Oh, uh, or you could
take Marcus.

15:11.258 --> 15:13.086
- Whoever.
Marcus!

15:13.129 --> 15:14.783
Security office, now!

15:14.826 --> 15:16.176
- Yep, just give me a second.

15:16.219 --> 15:18.439
If I run too fast,
I become airborne.

15:20.136 --> 15:22.051
- Thank you.
You know, Kelly,

15:22.095 --> 15:23.618
you didn't have
to change your costume.

15:23.661 --> 15:25.185
- And you didn't have to say
I was Jonah's girlfriend,

15:25.228 --> 15:26.534
yet here we are.

15:26.577 --> 15:28.014
- Hey, sorry.

15:28.057 --> 15:29.319
Just took off my costume
real quick.

15:29.363 --> 15:32.235
The cowboy hat was itchy.

15:32.279 --> 15:35.630
- Oh, my God, you two are Danny
and Sandy from "Grease"!

15:35.673 --> 15:37.545
"Summer Lovin'," right?

15:38.372 --> 15:42.550
- Amy, you need to go change
into leather Sandy right now.

15:43.681 --> 15:45.596
- All right,
no bags in housewares.

15:45.640 --> 15:46.771
Are you getting anything,
Marcus?

15:46.815 --> 15:48.643
- I gotta be honest,
about 60%

15:48.686 --> 15:50.340
of my vision's
blocked by the dragon head.

15:50.384 --> 15:51.559
- You're exuding,
like, a wet heat.

15:51.602 --> 15:53.082
- I know.
It's the dragon smoke function.

15:53.126 --> 15:54.562
- Now you're fogging up
the screen.

15:54.605 --> 15:56.346
- I can't control it.
- Oh, this is doing nothing.

15:56.390 --> 15:58.696
It's just moving it around.
- Yeah.

16:02.483 --> 16:06.139
- Okay, this is it.
There's no one in there now.

16:06.182 --> 16:09.359
Just a chance for me
to face my fears head-on.

16:09.403 --> 16:11.883
- Yes, go for it.

16:11.927 --> 16:14.103
- Whoa. Okay.
Well...

16:15.713 --> 16:18.325
Good luck, buddy.

16:21.545 --> 16:24.461
Sorry, haunted house is closed.

16:24.505 --> 16:27.551
Sorry.

16:27.595 --> 16:30.206
- I think we found the cards.
Well, I found them.

16:30.250 --> 16:31.991
Marcus knocked all my felt tips
on the floor,

16:32.034 --> 16:33.253
some of them lost their caps,

16:33.296 --> 16:34.863
and now it's just a race
against the clock

16:34.906 --> 16:36.996
until they dry out.
- Dina, where are the cards?

16:37.039 --> 16:38.214
- I saw footage
of Maya grabbing

16:38.258 --> 16:40.086
a goodie bag on her way out.
- What?

16:40.129 --> 16:42.218
No!
She left, like, 20 minutes ago.

16:42.262 --> 16:43.567
- Actually, no.

16:43.611 --> 16:45.047
She stopped in housewares
and had what looked like

16:45.091 --> 16:46.396
a very emotional moment
with Brett,

16:46.440 --> 16:47.919
then she went to grocery.

16:47.963 --> 16:49.138
Picked up eggs
and bell peppers.

16:49.182 --> 16:50.226
I think it's
a Denver omelet night.

16:50.270 --> 16:51.488
- Dina, where is she now?

16:51.532 --> 16:52.489
- She just went out
to the parking lot.

16:52.533 --> 16:53.925
- Well, we need to stop her.

16:53.969 --> 16:55.057
- Amy, wait!

16:55.101 --> 16:56.450
Do I still need to be
a part of this?

16:56.493 --> 16:58.452
Because, I hate to keep beating
the same drum,

16:58.495 --> 17:00.584
but the felt tips--
- I'll get you new felt tips!

17:00.628 --> 17:02.195
- I don't want new felt tips!

17:02.238 --> 17:04.675
I have perfectly good
felt tips on my floor!

17:07.809 --> 17:10.507
- Sorry.
It's just me.

17:10.551 --> 17:12.205
Not a carjacker.

17:12.248 --> 17:14.120
I didn't mean to startle you.
- It's okay.

17:14.163 --> 17:17.079
- It's just that, um, we need
you back in the store.

17:17.123 --> 17:18.254
- Why?

17:18.298 --> 17:20.082
- Attention, everyone.

17:20.126 --> 17:23.955
Give it up for the winner of
our Halloween costume contest,

17:23.999 --> 17:24.913
Maya!
Whoo, whoo!

17:26.349 --> 17:29.091
- So there is a contest,
and cat ears won it?

17:29.135 --> 17:31.441
- Okay, you don't need
to suck up to the new DM.

17:31.485 --> 17:33.356
- What?
No.

17:33.400 --> 17:35.228
No, girl.
You won.

17:35.271 --> 17:38.100
You look good
and you better get your prize,

17:38.144 --> 17:39.623
which is...

17:40.102 --> 17:43.584
- Which is, uh, this, um,
bottle of Sprite!

17:43.627 --> 17:46.152
- Are you  kidding me?

17:47.849 --> 17:49.764
- You don't think she's
gonna wait in the back

17:49.807 --> 17:52.375
of someone's car and then--
- No.

17:52.419 --> 17:54.986
But we should probably check
to see if the killer

17:55.030 --> 17:58.077
has a history of breaking
into cars 'cause...

18:00.644 --> 18:03.125
Oh, my God.
They found another foot.

18:03.169 --> 18:04.431
- Out in Richmond Heights.

18:04.474 --> 18:06.607
- Really?

18:06.650 --> 18:08.957
Apparently it's fresh.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.654
Some guy's probably bleeding
out as we speak.

18:10.698 --> 18:13.048
- Oh, that's amazing.
It can't be Dina.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.441
We've been watching
her all day.

18:14.484 --> 18:16.138
- Such good news.

18:16.182 --> 18:17.922
I'm so glad the killer
struck today.

18:17.966 --> 18:19.794
Wow. Not that I thought
it was her, but--

18:19.837 --> 18:21.187
- I know.
I mean, she's weird,

18:21.230 --> 18:22.840
but she's not a criminal.
- No.

18:26.888 --> 18:29.717
- And look at these cat ears.
Amazing!

18:29.760 --> 18:33.808
I think it says back here they
were, uh, made in Taiwan.

18:33.851 --> 18:35.592
Have you ever been to Taiwan?

18:35.636 --> 18:37.507
- Amy, is there a second place?

18:37.551 --> 18:39.030
Because I am drenched in urine.

18:39.074 --> 18:40.989
- Okay, um,
maybe we wrap this up.

18:41.032 --> 18:44.471
Uh, I am so honored
to receive this Sprite,

18:44.514 --> 18:46.168
especially because
so many of you

18:46.212 --> 18:48.823
had such great costumes here.
You know, like these two.

18:48.866 --> 18:51.478
They had multiple
couples costumes.

18:51.521 --> 18:52.740
Are they cute or what?

18:52.783 --> 18:54.002
- Jonah and Kelly aren't
a couple.

18:54.045 --> 18:55.917
- Yeah,
Jonah's in love with Amy.

18:55.960 --> 18:58.659
- Wait, what?
- What?

18:58.702 --> 19:00.269
I don't know.
That's--

19:00.313 --> 19:03.403
Jonah, is that true?

19:03.446 --> 19:05.622
- It's true.
I love her.

19:05.666 --> 19:07.189
Um, sorry, Kelly.

19:07.233 --> 19:08.843
I--I probably should
have told you

19:08.886 --> 19:11.672
before telling
the entire store,

19:11.715 --> 19:14.196
but I am breaking up with you.

19:14.240 --> 19:16.720
- Okay, it seems like I should
give you guys a little privacy.

19:16.764 --> 19:19.158
- Uh--
- Uh, no, no, no,

19:19.201 --> 19:22.030
because I need to explain more
to you, Kelly.

19:22.073 --> 19:25.207
Uh, you're a great gal,
but, uh,

19:25.251 --> 19:28.036
Amy and I just have
a connection.

19:28.079 --> 19:29.646
- I hate coming
to this stupid store.

19:29.690 --> 19:31.344
- I'm really gonna go now.

19:31.387 --> 19:36.175
- You can't because the costume
contest is not over yet.

19:37.306 --> 19:38.873
And now it's done!

19:38.916 --> 19:40.701
Another round of applause
for Maya the Cat.

19:42.050 --> 19:43.399
- Man.

19:43.443 --> 19:45.532
- Garrett, help!

19:45.575 --> 19:47.316
The doors are stuck!

19:47.360 --> 19:50.101
Oh, I should have listened
to that English boy.

19:50.145 --> 19:51.973
Hang on.

19:58.371 --> 20:00.286
Hey, Garrett.
It's Glenn from work.

20:00.329 --> 20:02.505
Um, first of all,
I found my phone.

20:02.549 --> 20:03.724
Yay.

20:03.767 --> 20:05.247
Uh, anyway,
if you get this,

20:05.291 --> 20:07.075
I am stuck
in the haunted house,

20:07.118 --> 20:11.210
so, um, call me back.
All right, bye-bye.

20:12.907 --> 20:15.388
Help!
Somebody!

20:17.912 --> 20:20.044
- Oh!

20:24.701 --> 20:27.704
Honestly, I've seen scarier.

20:27.748 --> 20:30.098
- That was exhausting.

20:30.141 --> 20:33.406
- Yeah, well,
breakups are exhausting.

20:33.449 --> 20:35.234
- Um...

20:35.277 --> 20:38.715
so the cards
are all here.

20:38.759 --> 20:39.977
- Great.

20:40.021 --> 20:44.460
- But also some
empty candy wrappers.

20:44.504 --> 20:46.201
- Okay.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.681
Okay, well--

20:47.724 --> 20:49.204
Let's not panic.

20:49.248 --> 20:52.251
Maybe she just, um, reached in
and grabbed some candy

20:52.294 --> 20:53.730
and didn't see the cards,

20:53.774 --> 20:56.516
or--or maybe those candies
are from somewhere else

20:56.559 --> 20:59.214
and she just ditched
the wrappers in there.

20:59.258 --> 21:01.434
- Or maybe she saw the cards.

21:01.477 --> 21:04.872
- But if she saw the cards,
she would have said something.

21:04.915 --> 21:08.615
- Yeah.
Yeah, I mean, definitely.

21:08.658 --> 21:09.964
Right?

21:12.967 --> 21:14.795
- Hey, so Maya left her Sprite.

21:14.838 --> 21:16.318
- Just take it.
- Yes!

21:16.362 --> 21:18.799
We did it, Tita!
Your boy won!
