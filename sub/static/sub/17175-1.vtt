[elevator bell dings]

00:24.024 --> 00:25.355
- Go on through the right.

00:37.170 --> 00:38.137
Here we are.

00:40.106 --> 00:42.734
- If you don't mind,
I'm gonna check out

00:42.809 --> 00:44.572
sort of sight lines here.

00:44.644 --> 00:46.111
- Sure.

00:58.558 --> 01:00.423
[instrumental music]

01:15.675 --> 01:18.508
-I was 16 when my sister
Kitty was murdered

01:18.578 --> 01:20.045
in New York City.

01:22.015 --> 01:24.711
In an instant she was gone.

01:34.027 --> 01:36.325
No one understood me
like Kitty.

01:42.836 --> 01:44.701
[music continues]

02:03.723 --> 02:05.156
-Two weeks ago today

02:05.225 --> 02:06.715
twenty minutes after 3:00
in the morning

02:06.793 --> 02:08.384
it was a dark night.

02:08.461 --> 02:11.225
Kitty Genovese, 28 years old,
drove her car

02:11.297 --> 02:13.959
into this parking lot
at the Kew Gardens Station

02:14.067 --> 02:16.934
of the Long Island Railroad as
she had been doing for a year.

02:17.036 --> 02:21.029
She stopped, saw a man
against the wall

02:21.107 --> 02:23.473
she didn't quite make it
halfway down the block

02:23.576 --> 02:26.067
before the killer
drove a knife into her.

02:26.146 --> 02:29.172
-I heard the screaming,
and I went to, uh,
the bedroom window

02:29.282 --> 02:32.080
and I saw some girl
on her knees

02:32.152 --> 02:34.347
and she was screaming,
"Help, help."

02:34.454 --> 02:37.150
-Just exactly what was it
you heard?

02:37.257 --> 02:38.747
- "Save me, save me."

02:38.825 --> 02:40.850
-Didn't this frighten you
or shock you?

02:40.960 --> 02:42.723
- No.

02:42.795 --> 02:45.229
- Fifteen years ago, a young
woman was stabbed to death

02:45.298 --> 02:46.788
in front of a Queens,
New York apartment

02:46.900 --> 02:48.868
half a block from her home.

02:48.935 --> 02:50.300
- Tomorrow marks
what many people regard

02:50.403 --> 02:51.870
as one of the most
shameful anniversaries

02:51.938 --> 02:53.428
in New York City history.

02:53.506 --> 02:54.973
-Fifty years ago, her murder

02:55.074 --> 02:57.235
led to the adoption
of the 911 system.

02:57.310 --> 02:59.403
- Police discovered
that more than 30 people

02:59.479 --> 03:00.946
had witnessed her attack

03:01.014 --> 03:02.106
and no one had picked up

03:02.182 --> 03:03.877
the phone to call the police.

03:06.286 --> 03:08.151
[music continues]

03:12.625 --> 03:14.490
-Lights came on
in the apartment building

03:14.594 --> 03:17.722
a window opened, the attacker
got nervous and left

03:17.797 --> 03:20.095
but not a single person
came to the rescue

03:20.166 --> 03:22.600
no one even called
the police at a time

03:22.669 --> 03:26.662
when the average response time
was 2 minutes.

03:26.773 --> 03:29.606
So the man came back
and stabbed her again.

03:33.980 --> 03:36.949
It sent a chilling message
suggesting that we were

03:37.016 --> 03:40.383
each of us,
not simply endangered..

03:40.486 --> 03:42.977
...but fundamentally alone.

03:46.726 --> 03:48.591
[music continues]

04:03.977 --> 04:06.411
-Two weeks after
my sister Kitty's funeral

04:06.479 --> 04:09.312
the "New York Times" published
a front-page story.

04:10.850 --> 04:13.546
It barely mentioned
her killer.

04:13.653 --> 04:16.588
Instead it focused
on Kitty's neighbors

04:16.656 --> 04:19.921
and practically blamed
38 of them for her death.

04:23.763 --> 04:25.856
"The Times" story
was seen as proof

04:25.932 --> 04:28.230
that New York City
was uncaring

04:28.334 --> 04:30.427
that America was
falling apart.

04:31.904 --> 04:33.269
And my sister's been
the symbol

04:33.373 --> 04:36.069
of bystander apathy
for decades.

04:37.677 --> 04:40.009
The girl no one cared about.

04:42.882 --> 04:46.181
But recently "The Times"
published a new article.

04:46.252 --> 04:48.015
It challenged the accuracy

04:48.087 --> 04:50.954
of its original report.

04:51.057 --> 04:54.254
And others now claim
the story of 38 witnesses

04:54.360 --> 04:56.328
is more myth than fact.

04:57.363 --> 04:59.228
[instrumental music]

05:06.372 --> 05:09.364
What did the witnesses
actually see or hear?

05:10.610 --> 05:12.771
Were there really 38?

05:14.714 --> 05:17.080
Why didn't they try
to help my sister?

05:19.218 --> 05:22.483
For years, I avoided
the details of that night

05:22.555 --> 05:24.853
because they were just
too painful

05:24.924 --> 05:27.449
but it's worse
not knowing the truth.

05:38.071 --> 05:39.766
-Mr. Skoller?

05:39.839 --> 05:41.500
- Bill?
-Yeah.

05:41.607 --> 05:43.199
- Hi.
-How you doing?

05:43.276 --> 05:46.074
- Alright. How are you?
Charlie Skoller.

05:46.145 --> 05:47.237
-Bill Genovese.
- How are you, Bill?

05:47.313 --> 05:48.644
-Nice to meet you.

05:48.748 --> 05:49.715
Going around here

05:49.782 --> 05:51.613
is anxiety provoking.

05:51.684 --> 05:52.878
- Are you sure
you wanna do this?

05:52.985 --> 05:53.974
This has to be
very difficult for you.

05:54.087 --> 05:55.520
- No, I absolutely

05:55.588 --> 05:56.782
I absolutely wanna do it.

05:58.658 --> 06:00.421
It's interesting. When you
drive back here it's --

06:00.493 --> 06:02.461
You know, when you're out
on Queens Boulevard there

06:02.528 --> 06:05.656
it seems so,
for me anyway, city-ish.

06:05.765 --> 06:08.859
Here now you're in this really
nice neighborhood.

06:08.935 --> 06:11.768
-This block is
all residential

06:11.838 --> 06:14.534
one-family homes.

06:14.640 --> 06:17.268
Pull into this parking lot.

06:17.343 --> 06:20.835
Because that's where
your sister pulled her car

06:20.947 --> 06:22.938
into this lane.

06:23.015 --> 06:25.142
And this is where

06:25.218 --> 06:27.413
Winston Moseley caught up to her

06:27.520 --> 06:31.786
and struck the first blows
to her back.

06:33.326 --> 06:35.419
Many of your sister's
neighbors

06:35.495 --> 06:37.986
really heard everything
that was going on,
heard the screams

06:38.064 --> 06:40.498
knew that an attack
was taking place

06:40.566 --> 06:43.091
and knew
that it was a violent attack.

06:43.202 --> 06:46.831
It wasn't that your sister
was just screaming and screaming

06:46.906 --> 06:50.034
she was yelling, "Help, help,
I'm being stabbed."

06:50.143 --> 06:53.476
That was not just screams alone.

06:53.546 --> 06:57.539
And Joseph Fink was seated
in the lobby of the Mowbray.

06:57.650 --> 07:00.312
He was the night
elevator operator

07:00.386 --> 07:04.584
and he saw the entire
first attack take place

07:04.690 --> 07:07.955
from beginning to end..

07:08.027 --> 07:11.019
...and he knew exactly
what was happening.

07:11.097 --> 07:13.759
And instead of doing anything,
he got on the elevator

07:13.866 --> 07:16.198
went downstairs,
went to his apartment

07:16.269 --> 07:18.134
and went to sleep.

07:20.072 --> 07:23.235
Now, as she was being attacked
in this hallway

07:23.342 --> 07:25.310
Karl Ross looked down

07:25.378 --> 07:28.870
and he saw
that second attack take place.

07:28.948 --> 07:31.382
And he went to the telephone

07:31.451 --> 07:33.646
called his girlfriend.

07:33.753 --> 07:36.779
She said, "Don't get involved."

07:36.889 --> 07:41.155
- It just kills me to think
that when he first looked down

07:41.227 --> 07:44.094
he could have ended it
right there by doing something.

07:44.197 --> 07:46.324
He could have yelled down, "I'm
calling the police." And that --

07:46.399 --> 07:49.732
-Yes. Or, "The police
are on their way."

07:49.802 --> 07:52.293
- How much time do you think,
if you can remember

07:52.405 --> 07:55.238
from the first attack
to when he finds her again?

07:55.308 --> 07:59.472
- I would say about a half
an hour, possibly 40 minutes.

07:59.579 --> 08:01.945
Long enough for somebody
to have called the police

08:02.048 --> 08:04.243
and for the police
to have arrived

08:04.317 --> 08:07.013
and probably to save
your sister's life.

08:12.658 --> 08:14.523
[instrumental music]

08:47.660 --> 08:49.525
[music continues]

08:51.931 --> 08:53.228
-Turns out,
I'm not the first

08:53.299 --> 08:55.164
to look for these witnesses.

08:57.136 --> 09:00.105
-We traced Karl Ross
to this pet store

09:00.172 --> 09:02.163
but we found that he'd sold it.

09:02.275 --> 09:05.108
The new people here kindly
agreed to contact him for us

09:05.177 --> 09:09.273
but Karl Ross remains silent.

09:09.348 --> 09:11.282
Mr. Koshkin, I wanted
to ask you one more time

09:11.350 --> 09:12.942
if you would speak to us?

09:13.019 --> 09:14.316
-20/20 had no luck

09:14.387 --> 09:17.220
interviewing witnesses
in 1979.

09:19.191 --> 09:20.954
If I was going
to have more success

09:21.027 --> 09:22.494
Charlie Skoller suggested

09:22.562 --> 09:25.497
that I start
with the trial transcript.

09:29.001 --> 09:32.493
My family couldn't bear
to go to the trial in 1964

09:32.572 --> 09:35.700
so I never heard the testimony
of the witnesses.

09:38.711 --> 09:42.374
Only 5 of the 38 witnesses
were called to take the stand.

09:43.583 --> 09:46.347
Samuel Koshkin, Robert Mozer

09:46.419 --> 09:49.411
Sophie Farrar, Andree Picq

09:49.522 --> 09:50.853
Irene Frost.

09:50.923 --> 09:52.788
[dramatic music]

09:58.064 --> 09:59.656
-I heard a shriek.

09:59.732 --> 10:01.893
I got outta bed,
went to the window

10:02.001 --> 10:03.195
and I saw a man and a woman

10:03.269 --> 10:05.032
standing across the street

10:05.104 --> 10:08.403
by the bookstore.
I looked at them for a minute.

10:08.507 --> 10:10.304
Nothin' happened,
so I got back to bed.

10:12.178 --> 10:14.976
The second time she screamed
"Please, help me, God.

10:15.047 --> 10:18.039
Please help me.
I've been stabbed."

10:18.117 --> 10:20.210
I went to the window,
and as I got there

10:20.286 --> 10:21.981
she was kneeling down
on the sidewalk

10:22.088 --> 10:24.522
and he was running
up the street.

10:27.193 --> 10:29.684
-Did you know
Irene Frost at all?

10:29.762 --> 10:31.627
She worked
for your grandfather.

10:31.731 --> 10:33.858
-Oh yeah, oh yeah.
I know the name well.

10:33.933 --> 10:37.369
My grandfather didn't know
much about running
the business

10:37.436 --> 10:39.700
and apparently
I -- Irene stole

10:39.772 --> 10:41.569
several $100,000 from him

10:41.641 --> 10:43.836
so her name
doesn't sit too favorably

10:43.943 --> 10:45.410
in the Hirsch family.

10:45.478 --> 10:46.570
- Now, do you know
if she's alive

10:46.646 --> 10:48.273
or dead at this point?

10:48.381 --> 10:50.246
-Oh, she's long dead.

10:52.318 --> 10:54.183
[instrumental music]

11:02.094 --> 11:05.222
-I saw this girl
at the bookstore kneeling

11:05.297 --> 11:07.822
and this fellow had her down
bending over her.

11:07.933 --> 11:10.766
And I hollered,
"Hey, get out of there."

11:10.836 --> 11:13.600
And he jumped up and ran.

11:13.673 --> 11:16.039
He ran like a scared rabbit.

11:16.142 --> 11:18.474
I never saw anybody
take off as quick.

11:24.016 --> 11:25.881
[music continues]

11:38.664 --> 11:41.326
-I heard the voice upstairs.

11:41.434 --> 11:43.629
Suddenly, the neighbor's
screaming something

11:43.703 --> 11:46.331
and the man ran away
very fast, near the bus stop.

11:47.807 --> 11:50.935
The poor girl get up slowly..

11:51.010 --> 11:53.638
...and she screamed, "Help!"

11:53.713 --> 11:55.578
And walking slowly
toward the drugstore

11:55.681 --> 11:57.308
and up towards
the back street.

11:59.318 --> 12:00.910
I was still at the window

12:00.986 --> 12:03.011
scared, kind of frozen.

12:05.157 --> 12:07.455
And a few minutes
after that man came back

12:07.526 --> 12:10.461
walking normally
as if nothing happened.

12:10.529 --> 12:13.157
And then he went down
to the train station

12:13.232 --> 12:15.097
and then he came out again

12:15.201 --> 12:16.964
and left in the back

12:17.036 --> 12:19.561
and I could not see anything..

12:19.672 --> 12:22.334
...but I heard
the last 2 screams.

12:22.408 --> 12:24.672
"Help, help."

12:24.744 --> 12:26.609
[music continues]

12:54.774 --> 12:56.639
[music continues]

12:59.845 --> 13:03.144
-Hi, is this
the Michael Farrar
from Kew Gardens?

13:03.215 --> 13:05.479
Michael, I just
recently found out

13:05.551 --> 13:09.146
that your mom was with my sister
when she passed away.

13:09.221 --> 13:12.213
I was wondering if she'd be
willing to talk to me?

13:17.296 --> 13:20.288
- My mom, she really
liked Kitty.

13:20.399 --> 13:22.196
And, you know, she can't get
around no more

13:22.268 --> 13:25.465
but I spoke to her
and she told me stuff

13:25.571 --> 13:28.836
that I couldn't hear when I was
younger, what happened and all.

13:28.908 --> 13:31.035
We'll get into that later.

13:40.152 --> 13:41.847
- This was Kitty's
apartment here.

13:41.954 --> 13:44.286
- On this side?
- Right here, yes.

13:44.390 --> 13:45.721
- And then yours
is straight ahead?

13:45.791 --> 13:47.315
- Yes.

13:59.505 --> 14:01.530
This room here,
this was my room.

14:01.640 --> 14:04.666
Kitty's window is right there.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.109
When I went
to school sometimes

14:09.181 --> 14:10.205
if Kitty would have coffee

14:10.316 --> 14:12.841
and toast with my mom.

14:12.952 --> 14:15.147
Kitty confided in her a lot.

14:15.254 --> 14:16.414
They were friends
and they talked

14:16.488 --> 14:17.853
about whatever women

14:17.957 --> 14:19.288
talked about, you know.

14:20.826 --> 14:22.350
-So that night,
what happened?

14:22.461 --> 14:24.292
I mean, in your house,
what happened?

14:24.363 --> 14:27.821
- A -- a scream,
a loud, loud scream

14:27.933 --> 14:31.892
a horrible,
blood curdling scream

14:31.971 --> 14:33.438
and it woke me up.

14:33.505 --> 14:35.871
- How many people
do you think heard it?

14:38.444 --> 14:41.538
- Just looking at the windows,
about 40, 50

14:41.614 --> 14:44.412
could be 60
because it was so loud.

14:44.483 --> 14:47.611
Uh, the whole neighborhood
had to hear it.

14:47.686 --> 14:50.348
And this neighborhood
back in the 60s

14:50.456 --> 14:52.720
I remember
a lot of the older people

14:52.791 --> 14:55.316
they had numbers on their arms

14:55.394 --> 14:58.056
they were
in concentration camps.

14:58.163 --> 15:00.654
That type of a person
might not wanna get involved

15:00.733 --> 15:03.861
with authorities because
of what happened
with the Nazis

15:03.969 --> 15:07.666
so, you know, you can't blame
people for being afraid.

15:07.740 --> 15:11.767
But that night
when I walked up the hallway

15:11.877 --> 15:15.142
my parents were up, out,
this window was open

15:15.214 --> 15:17.910
and my father was looking out
the window.

15:18.017 --> 15:19.348
Well, he didn't see anything

15:19.418 --> 15:21.909
so my parents went back to bed.

15:22.021 --> 15:24.319
About 20 minutes later or so

15:24.390 --> 15:26.415
somebody called my mom

15:26.525 --> 15:30.552
and that's when my mom
said to my father

15:30.663 --> 15:33.996
"Kitty's in the hall bleeding."

15:34.066 --> 15:37.661
And she just grabbed her jacket
and threw it on.

15:37.736 --> 15:39.203
And she started to run

15:39.271 --> 15:41.364
and my father was putting
his pants on

15:41.440 --> 15:43.203
and he says,
"Wait, wait for me."

15:43.275 --> 15:45.140
And she ran down.

15:50.883 --> 15:54.046
- So she comes in, it's 3:30
in the morning or thereabouts

15:54.119 --> 15:55.245
and it's freezing cold.

15:55.354 --> 15:58.050
- It was cold March..

15:58.123 --> 16:00.148
...and this is actually
the doorway.

16:01.961 --> 16:05.920
When my mom tried to open
the door, it hit Kitty

16:06.031 --> 16:09.023
and she was facing her head
towards the door

16:09.101 --> 16:10.728
her feet towards the stairs

16:10.803 --> 16:15.001
and my mother had to push
the door in to get in.

16:15.107 --> 16:17.302
She held her,
and she could feel

16:17.409 --> 16:19.604
the stab wounds in her back

16:19.712 --> 16:23.409
and her hands kept going,
still fighting

16:23.482 --> 16:26.110
and my mom
finally calmed her down

16:26.218 --> 16:29.676
but she couldn't talk
and she started to gurgle.

16:29.755 --> 16:32.280
That was her, she was just
passing then

16:32.391 --> 16:35.360
she was dying, so --

16:36.662 --> 16:40.029
Hours later I opened the door

16:40.132 --> 16:43.795
and the whole bottom
of this foyer was blood.

16:45.004 --> 16:45.993
[instrumental music]

16:49.141 --> 16:52.235
But you could actually
smell the blood.

16:55.147 --> 16:56.944
You know, it's like something
you don't forget.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.041
It's like walking
in an old butcher shop

16:59.151 --> 17:02.643
how you could smell that
the -- the human, the meat.

17:02.755 --> 17:04.746
It -- You know, it --

17:07.593 --> 17:11.461
The prints on the wall
were marked in pencil

17:11.530 --> 17:13.896
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

17:13.999 --> 17:15.694
And it wasn't until
I was talking to my mother

17:15.800 --> 17:19.567
and I said when I looked in,
I saw the handprint.

17:19.637 --> 17:23.233
And she says, "That was
my fingerprints on the wall."

17:23.308 --> 17:24.638
- Your mom?
-Yeah.

17:24.710 --> 17:27.076
'Cause when she went
to get up, she was like

17:27.179 --> 17:30.945
she went and she put her hands
on the wall.

17:31.016 --> 17:35.510
My mom spoke to one woman
from a newspaper back then

17:35.621 --> 17:38.112
and she told her what happened
and the woman says

17:38.190 --> 17:39.953
you know, "Would you do that
again, if you had to? "

17:40.025 --> 17:42.016
And my mother says,
"Certainly, of course."

17:42.127 --> 17:44.152
When the paper come out,
it says my mom said

17:44.229 --> 17:45.924
that she would never get
involved with it

17:46.031 --> 17:48.226
and that's when my mother says,
"lt don't pay to talk

17:48.333 --> 17:50.324
because they twist
what you say."

17:50.402 --> 17:54.429
And that's, she never said
anything since...you know.

17:54.540 --> 17:56.974
- Do you think your mother
would talk to me?

17:57.042 --> 18:00.011
- I -- I'll twist her arm
a little, you know,
but I think she would.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.444
- Not, not too hard, but --

18:01.547 --> 18:04.141
- I think that she would
do that.

18:04.216 --> 18:05.183
- Thank you so much.

18:05.250 --> 18:06.239
- I wish it could have been

18:06.351 --> 18:07.318
different circumstances.

18:07.386 --> 18:08.876
Alright?
- Yeah, really.

18:08.987 --> 18:11.922
- You know, give the best
to your family and --

18:15.027 --> 18:16.892
[music continues]

18:26.238 --> 18:29.366
-Why was Sophia left out
of the original story?

18:34.446 --> 18:37.540
It would have made such
a difference to my family

18:37.616 --> 18:40.244
knowing that Kitty died
in the arms of a friend.

18:43.956 --> 18:47.119
Truth is my family
doesn't know much
about Kitty's murder.

18:50.362 --> 18:53.024
The only time we learned
any details of that night

18:53.098 --> 18:54.895
was in 1995.

18:54.967 --> 18:58.130
That's when the killer
appealed for a retrial.

19:01.440 --> 19:03.601
It briefly brought us
face to face with the man

19:03.709 --> 19:06.337
who murdered and attempted
to rape Kitty.

19:09.481 --> 19:11.312
Hearing those details
for the first time

19:11.416 --> 19:14.283
was unbearable for me
and my siblings.

19:17.789 --> 19:19.222
- Speaking for myself..

19:21.493 --> 19:22.926
[sighs]

19:22.995 --> 19:25.088
...it never goes away.

19:28.300 --> 19:31.497
I never forget the day

19:31.603 --> 19:33.798
that the policemen
in New Canaan

19:33.906 --> 19:37.239
came to our door,
knocked on it..

19:37.309 --> 19:38.742
...and told us what happened.

19:38.810 --> 19:40.402
- It was very early
in the morning

19:40.479 --> 19:41.946
and the doorbell went off

19:42.014 --> 19:43.709
and I think
I was awakened by that

19:43.815 --> 19:46.682
and I heard
the -- the conversations.

19:46.785 --> 19:48.218
And then, then, then

19:48.287 --> 19:51.450
just ex -- extreme

19:51.523 --> 19:54.515
like piercing, screaming.

19:54.626 --> 19:57.094
And then freezing in my bed.

19:58.931 --> 20:01.900
-My mother, my mother
was a basket case.

20:01.967 --> 20:05.425
My father was also.

20:05.504 --> 20:08.803
My father couldn't even
identify my, my, uh

20:08.874 --> 20:12.310
sister's body in the morgue. He
had to send his brother there.

20:12.377 --> 20:13.742
- And the neighbors
are all like

20:13.845 --> 20:16.541
"Oh, my God,
what can we do for you? "

20:16.648 --> 20:19.481
And it's like, uh --

20:19.551 --> 20:22.213
"Why don't you take,
why don't you take Frank? "

20:22.321 --> 20:24.619
I -- I just went off
to the McSweeny's.

20:25.791 --> 20:27.588
I was with them for weeks.

20:29.161 --> 20:32.324
I never even went
to my sister's funeral.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.595
It was all over the news,
everywhere.

20:38.670 --> 20:40.934
So, I got a lot
of my information

20:41.006 --> 20:44.806
just from sneaking maybe,
and turning on a TV and --

20:47.980 --> 20:51.848
-The only thing we could
think about is the tragedy.

20:51.917 --> 20:55.614
We almost erased her
from our lives.

20:57.189 --> 20:59.054
[instrumental music]

21:01.260 --> 21:04.787
Bill, it's hard to say
how he handled it.

21:04.896 --> 21:07.387
I -- I -- I really, you know,
we really never sat down

21:07.499 --> 21:10.798
and talked about it.

21:10.869 --> 21:13.963
She took a --
a shine to Billy.

21:18.010 --> 21:20.478
She spent a lot of time
with him.

21:31.189 --> 21:33.987
-Kitty and I were separated
when I was 6.

21:35.927 --> 21:37.554
That year my parents decided

21:37.629 --> 21:39.494
the city
was getting too dangerous

21:39.598 --> 21:41.862
so we left
for New Canaan, Connecticut.

21:44.303 --> 21:46.669
Kitty had already
graduated high school

21:46.772 --> 21:48.706
and much to my parent's
frustration

21:48.774 --> 21:50.742
she decided
to stay in the city.

21:52.944 --> 21:55.777
For the next 10 years,
I only saw her on weekends

21:55.881 --> 21:57.143
when she would come to visit.

21:59.117 --> 22:02.644
We'd have a lot of fun driving
around in her red Fiat.

22:06.825 --> 22:09.157
But the best part was talking
late into the night.

22:10.829 --> 22:14.595
Kitty seemed to know
about everything.

22:14.666 --> 22:17.362
And I was a curious kid
and asked a lot of questions.

22:19.404 --> 22:21.565
Kitty always took the time
to answer them.

22:43.628 --> 22:47.257
For decades, the identity
of the so called 38 witnesses

22:47.332 --> 22:49.357
has been a mystery.

22:49.468 --> 22:51.629
If I was going to track
any of them down

22:51.703 --> 22:55.503
first I'd have to find out
who they were.

22:55.607 --> 22:58.599
I requested
all the information
on my sister's murder

22:58.677 --> 23:02.010
from the New York police
department.

23:02.114 --> 23:04.708
They sent me copies
of the original detective

23:04.783 --> 23:08.116
accounts of witness interviews
called DD5's.

23:10.155 --> 23:12.953
-I saw her, she was wearing
a black coat and high heels

23:13.024 --> 23:15.322
and the coat was held
around her body.

23:15.394 --> 23:18.659
She was a, a small girl --
-Terrific scream.

23:18.730 --> 23:21.426
-What I thought at first
was some cat --

23:21.533 --> 23:24.866
-It sounded like a child.

23:24.970 --> 23:29.464
-And I looked out to see
and I couldn't see anything.
-Otherwise I --

23:29.541 --> 23:32.135
-The police want to know
your name and everything
and they get people involved.

23:32.210 --> 23:34.405
These kind of people don't
want to get involved.
-Why didn't we do something?

23:34.513 --> 23:36.708
-I mean, I -- I feel
a terrible guilt.

23:40.819 --> 23:43.413
-Much of the reports
were illegible.

23:43.488 --> 23:46.082
And almost all the names
had been redacted.

23:50.362 --> 23:54.196
I was at a dead end
without the names.

23:54.266 --> 23:56.962
But I thought of someone
who might be able to help.

23:57.068 --> 23:59.263
- 20/20 has gone back
to reexamine

23:59.371 --> 24:00.861
what has become
a classic case

24:00.939 --> 24:03.305
not of crime,
but of social behavior.

24:03.408 --> 24:04.773
-Hello?
-Aram?

24:04.876 --> 24:06.707
-Yes.
-This is Bill Genovese.

24:06.778 --> 24:08.541
My sister was Kitty Genovese.

24:08.613 --> 24:10.706
-Oh, yes.
Oh, my goodness.

24:10.782 --> 24:14.479
- Did you, did you have any
luck in reaching
any of the witnesses?

24:14.586 --> 24:16.747
-I did try
to track them down, yes.

24:16.855 --> 24:18.823
I used to have a file.

24:18.890 --> 24:21.085
Uh, I have some stuff
at Columbia

24:21.193 --> 24:23.525
and, uh, if it were anywhere

24:23.595 --> 24:25.085
it could be there.

24:26.431 --> 24:28.296
[instrumental music]

24:30.302 --> 24:31.735
-The list Aram had found

24:31.803 --> 24:33.168
contained summarized versions

24:33.271 --> 24:35.865
of the witness accounts.

24:35.941 --> 24:39.741
Most importantly,
it had the names.

24:39.811 --> 24:41.642
These statements
from the neighbors

24:41.746 --> 24:44.442
matched the DD5 reports.

24:44.549 --> 24:48.041
So Aram's list must have come
from the police interviews.

24:49.788 --> 24:51.221
When I added up the number

24:51.289 --> 24:53.086
of entries, there were 38.

24:54.793 --> 24:56.886
Could these be
the 38 witnesses?

24:58.930 --> 25:00.795
[music continues]

25:08.006 --> 25:09.871
[dogs barking]

25:15.947 --> 25:18.575
Lynne, I presume.
- Yes, Bill, I presume.

25:18.650 --> 25:21.847
-Yes, and you're Tod.
- This is Tod. Bill.

25:21.953 --> 25:23.887
- Uh, Bill.
-How're you doing?

25:23.955 --> 25:25.718
- Good.
Can I help?

25:25.790 --> 25:27.758
- Nah, I'm good.
- Okay.

25:30.595 --> 25:31.584
- Can't we help you?

25:31.663 --> 25:33.130
- Over here, yeah.

25:34.799 --> 25:36.790
So, you lived
in the Mowbray?

25:36.868 --> 25:38.495
What apartment, what floor?

25:38.603 --> 25:42.232
- Second floor. 214.

25:42.307 --> 25:44.138
- Did you feel
like the neighborhood was safe?

25:44.209 --> 25:45.198
- Yes.

25:45.310 --> 25:46.937
- Cause you were 19, 20

25:47.012 --> 25:48.673
around 1964.

25:48.780 --> 25:51.271
Did you feel you could come
and go in the evening?

25:51.349 --> 25:55.012
- Oh, yes,
but I could see people

25:55.120 --> 25:57.611
and they would just pull down
the shades or --

25:57.689 --> 25:59.316
There was a fear.

25:59.391 --> 26:02.883
There was a fear
in that building, I think.

26:02.994 --> 26:04.859
-What was your experience
that night?

26:04.963 --> 26:07.329
- I heard a scream.
It woke me up.

26:07.399 --> 26:09.890
I looked out the window,
I didn't see anything

26:10.001 --> 26:11.628
I didn't hear any more.

26:11.703 --> 26:14.399
And I said, "Oh, well."
I went back to sleep.

26:14.506 --> 26:16.303
- Did it wake your parents up?

26:16.374 --> 26:18.467
- No, as far as I know.

26:18.543 --> 26:22.035
The next morning
the detectives were pounding
on the door

26:22.147 --> 26:24.513
and I told them what I had,
you know, experienced.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.016
- Yeah.

26:26.084 --> 26:28.678
- Do you think you were
1 of the 38

26:28.753 --> 26:31.881
that were reported
to have done nothing?

26:31.990 --> 26:34.015
- I -- I supposed I could be

26:34.092 --> 26:35.889
I could be counted
in with that.

26:35.994 --> 26:37.086
-Hmm.
When the police --

26:37.162 --> 26:38.686
- Because I woke up

26:38.763 --> 26:43.530
I looked out the window...
and I went back to bed.

26:45.103 --> 26:48.300
But I wasn't in that group.
-Yeah.

26:48.406 --> 26:51.239
- I -- I, that was not my
behavior in that, in that.

26:51.343 --> 26:52.867
-Yeah.
- Yeah.

26:52.944 --> 26:56.436
- In my research, your name
and your mom's name

26:56.548 --> 26:58.311
is down there as saying

26:58.383 --> 27:02.012
"I heard, George, he's --"
Eh, let me get it right

27:02.087 --> 27:04.578
"George, he's, he's done it
to me.

27:04.689 --> 27:07.283
George, he's done it to me."
Twice.

27:07.359 --> 27:09.884
And then, "Please help me."

27:09.961 --> 27:11.986
So, you and your mom

27:12.097 --> 27:15.726
you were probably counted
as part of the 38.

27:17.302 --> 27:19.770
And, according
to your remembering

27:19.871 --> 27:22.669
your mom never said anything?

27:22.741 --> 27:25.710
- No, as far as I know, she
never spoke to the police
at all.

27:25.777 --> 27:27.244
-Yeah.

27:27.312 --> 27:29.075
-Wow, I have no idea
who George is

27:29.147 --> 27:33.811
but I, I never heard
of anything like that.

27:33.918 --> 27:36.409
And as far as I know
momma was asleep.

27:36.488 --> 27:37.648
That is shocking.

27:39.457 --> 27:40.481
Wow.

27:42.394 --> 27:44.259
[instrumental music]

27:46.598 --> 27:47.724
[knocks on the door]

27:49.834 --> 27:51.768
- Come on in.
- Hello.

27:51.836 --> 27:54.134
- How are ya?
- You're Hattie?

27:54.239 --> 27:55.831
- Yes.
- Hi, Bill Genovese.

27:55.907 --> 27:57.374
- Nice to meet you.
- How're you doing?

27:57.442 --> 27:58.409
- Nice strong grip.

28:00.779 --> 28:02.974
-Were you ever interviewed
by the police?

28:03.081 --> 28:05.242
- Yes, I think I was, yeah.

28:05.316 --> 28:08.410
- This is what they recorded
anyway, that you said to them.

28:08.486 --> 28:12.115
"Hattie Grund, saw a woman
screaming, "Help."

28:12.190 --> 28:15.455
"She was standing
in front of cleaners.
No male was present."

28:15.527 --> 28:21.056
- That's true. I heard somebody
saying "Help, help.."

28:21.166 --> 28:24.795
...from what I recall
and then I called the police.

28:24.869 --> 28:26.359
- You called the police?
-Always.

28:26.471 --> 28:30.498
And they said,
"We already got the calls."

28:30.608 --> 28:33.543
- Hmm.
-I didn't even finish
my statement.

28:33.611 --> 28:37.206
And they said,
"We've already gotten the call."

28:37.282 --> 28:39.113
It wasn't that people
didn't call.

28:39.184 --> 28:42.449
There might have been other
people that called..

28:42.520 --> 28:45.683
...because once you got
the police station

28:45.790 --> 28:49.624
before you could finish they
said, "We've gotten the calls."

28:49.694 --> 28:53.528
- When news reporters, uh,
came to talk to you, uh

28:53.631 --> 28:57.123
were they pushing the, you
know, the witness story
and asking --

28:57.202 --> 29:00.638
- Oh yeah, they were persistent
in getting information,
you know.

29:00.705 --> 29:04.141
And that's the thing Kew Gardens
got a little aroused

29:04.209 --> 29:06.700
when they said they were,
we were apathetic.

29:09.347 --> 29:12.282
We were not. There are always
a few people that call.

29:17.422 --> 29:19.754
[instrumental music]

29:19.858 --> 29:21.621
-After hearing
Hattie Grund claim

29:21.693 --> 29:23.684
she and others
called the police.

29:23.762 --> 29:28.062
I requested the police log
of phone calls
from that night.

29:28.166 --> 29:30.760
The only call they list
is from Karl Ross

29:30.835 --> 29:32.632
well after Moseley was gone.

29:34.339 --> 29:37.331
Did the police fail
to log the calls?

29:37.408 --> 29:40.571
Or did Hattie just create
a story she could live with?

29:43.515 --> 29:45.847
A witness who doesn't know
she's a witness.

29:47.519 --> 29:51.216
So many other missed details
of that night.

29:51.289 --> 29:53.814
Like the fact that Kitty
didn't die alone.

29:56.795 --> 29:59.593
How could anything be believed
about this story?

30:03.735 --> 30:05.100
I never questioned it.

30:06.871 --> 30:08.202
Two years after Kitty's death

30:08.273 --> 30:09.740
I graduated high school.

30:11.276 --> 30:14.609
The Vietnam War
was in full swing.

30:14.712 --> 30:17.306
Many of my peers were looking
for ways not to serve.

30:18.950 --> 30:20.542
Whether the war
was right or wrong

30:20.618 --> 30:21.642
I couldn't help but see them

30:21.753 --> 30:24.722
as apathetic bystanders.

30:24.789 --> 30:27.758
I wasn't going to be like
the 38 witnesses

30:27.826 --> 30:29.760
So I enlisted in the Marines.

30:31.763 --> 30:35.062
And at 18, you're going off
to war and you're thinking

30:35.133 --> 30:36.623
"I'll come home okay."

30:41.472 --> 30:43.337
[music continues]

30:58.523 --> 31:01.356
-I think he's looking
for the ultimate inner peace.

31:01.459 --> 31:03.893
The choices that he made
in his life

31:03.962 --> 31:06.226
um, were all related to the fact

31:06.297 --> 31:09.630
that no one
helped his sister.

31:11.669 --> 31:14.297
And if he knows the truth,
that's a peacefulness.

31:16.507 --> 31:20.136
I mean, I'm hoping for Bill
that there'll be closure.

31:20.211 --> 31:21.542
You know, like he didn't
lose his legs

31:21.646 --> 31:23.170
in Vietnam for nothing.

31:29.120 --> 31:30.985
[music continues]

31:41.332 --> 31:43.994
-The version of the story
that was accepted as fact

31:44.068 --> 31:45.501
for so many years was written

31:45.570 --> 31:48.232
by the late reporter
Martin Gansberg.

31:49.641 --> 31:50.835
His editor at "The Time"

31:50.909 --> 31:53.070
was a man named Abe Rosenthal

31:53.177 --> 31:56.340
who became a major figure
in journalism.

31:56.414 --> 31:58.882
From what I've found,
it's Rosenthal

31:58.983 --> 32:01.577
who's credited with breaking
the story.

32:01.653 --> 32:03.245
And later that year

32:03.321 --> 32:06.085
he wrote a book called
"38 Witnesses."

32:09.928 --> 32:12.795
-This story has never died.

32:12.897 --> 32:15.730
I still get mail about it,
people write theses about it.

32:15.833 --> 32:19.200
There are lectures
and seminars at universities.

32:19.270 --> 32:21.568
They are obsessed
by this story.

32:23.708 --> 32:24.675
It's like a jewel.

32:24.742 --> 32:26.107
You keep looking at it

32:26.210 --> 32:27.802
and different things
occur to you.

32:27.879 --> 32:30.040
It's affected my approach
to life, I think.

32:35.286 --> 32:37.720
-Okay, sir.

32:37.789 --> 32:40.883
-According to his book,
he first heard
my sister's name

32:40.959 --> 32:43.086
when he had lunch
with the city's police chief

32:43.194 --> 32:44.855
10 days after the murder.

32:47.065 --> 32:49.431
- I was, uh, nauseated
at the idea

32:49.534 --> 32:51.525
that people in New York City

32:51.602 --> 32:54.901
in Queens, knew that a girl
was getting killed.

32:54.973 --> 32:57.066
And later they dis,
it was discovered

32:57.141 --> 33:01.805
that 38 people
didn't do anything.

33:01.913 --> 33:05.576
It was the failure
of New York City

33:05.650 --> 33:07.618
or the people
of New York City

33:07.719 --> 33:10.984
to take action, stick out
a hand, do something.

33:11.055 --> 33:14.752
- Right.
- Shout, "Hey, we need help."

33:14.826 --> 33:18.694
And that was what grabbed
the people of the city

33:18.796 --> 33:20.161
and other cities.

33:20.264 --> 33:22.255
- Well, where did
the number 38 come?

33:22.333 --> 33:26.667
I wonder was it synthesized
somehow to make a big impact?
- No.

33:26.771 --> 33:28.136
-So that we could
get a positive.

33:28.239 --> 33:29.729
I mean,
for a positive result --

33:29.807 --> 33:31.502
- You asked the question
and I'm telling you.

33:31.609 --> 33:34.134
I can't swear to God

33:34.245 --> 33:36.338
that there were 38 people.

33:36.414 --> 33:37.438
Some people say
there were more

33:37.515 --> 33:39.039
some people say
there were less

33:39.150 --> 33:41.118
but what was true..

33:41.185 --> 33:44.052
...people all over the world

33:44.155 --> 33:45.782
were affected by it.

33:45.857 --> 33:47.518
Did it do anything?

33:47.625 --> 33:50.150
You bet your eye
it did something.

33:50.261 --> 33:52.354
And I'm glad it did.

33:56.267 --> 33:58.132
[instrumental music]

34:00.838 --> 34:03.136
-Forty years after
the original article appeared

34:03.207 --> 34:06.574
the "New York Times"
reexamined their account.

34:06.677 --> 34:10.168
They acknowledged
some of the original
article's flaws

34:10.281 --> 34:13.909
and highlighted the questions
surrounding the story.

34:13.985 --> 34:15.976
Most of the revisionist
information

34:16.054 --> 34:17.987
came from Joe DeMay.

34:18.056 --> 34:21.514
A Kew Gardens resident
and amateur historian.

34:21.626 --> 34:24.958
- I sat down and I read
through the article

34:25.029 --> 34:27.054
and when it was all through
I thought to myself

34:27.165 --> 34:28.655
"What the heck this,
this can't make

34:28.733 --> 34:30.257
this doesn't make
any sense at all."

34:30.368 --> 34:32.699
If you read
through the article

34:32.804 --> 34:34.567
the first paragraph
is crystal clear

34:34.639 --> 34:35.628
and absolutely riveting.

34:36.808 --> 34:38.435
For more than half an hour

34:38.509 --> 34:40.500
38 respectable,
law-abiding citizens

34:40.578 --> 34:42.773
in Queens watched
a killer stalk
and stab a woman

34:42.880 --> 34:46.007
in 3 separate attacks
in Kew Gardens.

34:46.083 --> 34:49.349
Well, turns out there weren't
38 eyewitnesses at all.

34:49.420 --> 34:52.081
The witnesses to the case,
with one or two exceptions

34:52.190 --> 34:55.523
were ear witnesses,
not eye witnesses.

34:55.592 --> 34:57.288
What happened is this.

34:57.395 --> 35:00.364
There was an initial attack
on Austin Street

35:00.431 --> 35:03.093
that was broken off,
the killer fled.

35:03.201 --> 35:04.896
Your sister then got up
and she walked around

35:05.002 --> 35:06.697
to the back of the building.

35:06.771 --> 35:08.864
The people in the apartment
building could not

35:08.940 --> 35:12.603
have seen her for more
than a couple of minutes.

35:12.710 --> 35:14.541
When they saw him come back
the few witnesses

35:14.612 --> 35:16.443
that were still at their
windows, Kitty was long gone

35:16.547 --> 35:18.981
as far as they knew
she was some place safe.

35:19.050 --> 35:22.679
So, yeah, the story
was generally correct

35:22.753 --> 35:24.721
but in a lot of the important
details it was grossly

35:24.789 --> 35:26.916
exaggerated and simply
not true.

35:32.697 --> 35:34.858
-When I first came upon
his website

35:34.932 --> 35:37.400
my first reaction
was to sort of brush it off.

35:37.468 --> 35:39.402
But then I came back
and read it very closely

35:39.470 --> 35:43.839
and realized, "Wow, his argument
is incredibly compelling."

35:43.941 --> 35:46.705
If the story had been reported
more accurately

35:46.777 --> 35:48.870
it still would have been
a 2 or 3 day

35:48.946 --> 35:50.743
maybe -- maybe even 4 day story

35:50.815 --> 35:53.306
but it would not have been
a 50 year story.

35:53.417 --> 35:56.250
We would not still be sitting
here talking about it today.

35:56.320 --> 35:59.255
- Did anybody ever challenge
the 38 witness

35:59.323 --> 36:01.689
38 eyewitness story?

36:01.792 --> 36:03.817
- Yeah. Not at the time.

36:03.928 --> 36:07.420
Not in 1964.
In fact to the contrary.

36:07.498 --> 36:11.798
Other newspapers, other
magazines, "Li-Life Magazine"

36:11.903 --> 36:14.701
ran with it and then even
exaggerated it further.

36:18.676 --> 36:20.200
-This is Mike Wallace.

36:20.311 --> 36:23.747
Why did 38 people fail to act?

36:23.814 --> 36:26.180
The answer to that question
concerns every one of us

36:26.284 --> 36:29.082
who fears perhaps that apathy

36:29.153 --> 36:31.678
has become part
of our way of life.

36:31.789 --> 36:33.450
-The question becomes

36:33.524 --> 36:35.890
was it worth
all the attention it got

36:35.993 --> 36:39.258
or was it a media creation?

36:39.330 --> 36:44.427
- Oh, I think to a certain
degree it was a media creation.

36:44.502 --> 36:47.164
No one investigated the 38.

36:47.271 --> 36:50.707
No one followed up on it
or anything of that nature.

36:50.775 --> 36:53.141
- Do you have any feel
for why that would have been

36:53.211 --> 36:57.511
with this case
versus any other case?

36:57.615 --> 36:59.139
- Because it was taken
seriously

36:59.217 --> 37:00.684
by "The New York Times."

37:02.520 --> 37:04.488
The reason I picked up on it..

37:04.555 --> 37:09.583
...was because Abe Rosenthal
is a man I respect.

37:09.694 --> 37:12.891
Good reporter, in a position
of authority

37:12.997 --> 37:14.988
at "The New York Times."

37:15.066 --> 37:19.867
I mean, "The Times" had, still
does, but back then particularly

37:19.971 --> 37:21.962
had that kind of clout.

37:22.039 --> 37:26.408
It's a fascinating...
troubling story.

37:30.915 --> 37:34.715
And undoubtedly,
sold newspapers.

37:34.819 --> 37:37.811
- Hi, is this Mr. Lelyveld?
-Yes, sir.

37:37.888 --> 37:40.015
-When did you start working
at "The Times? "

37:40.091 --> 37:43.720
-I became a reporter
in 1963, I guess.

37:43.828 --> 37:47.093
- Do you think the original
"Times" story is accurate?

37:47.164 --> 37:50.429
-I remember feeling
it was a little skimpy.
- Yeah.

37:50.501 --> 37:53.527
-That it, that it reached
its judgment quickly.

37:53.604 --> 37:56.368
- Have you ever heard
of a woman named Sophia Farrar?

37:56.440 --> 37:57.429
-No.

37:57.541 --> 37:59.008
-Sophia Farrar actually did

37:59.076 --> 38:00.509
go down to be with her

38:00.578 --> 38:02.239
as soon as she found out
about it.

38:02.346 --> 38:04.143
-And did the police list her

38:04.215 --> 38:05.648
as a witness in their reports?

38:05.716 --> 38:08.207
- Yeah, she testified in court.

38:08.286 --> 38:10.083
-And she's not mentioned
in "The Times" story?

38:10.187 --> 38:11.154
- No.

38:11.222 --> 38:12.189
-Well, that's just, uh

38:12.256 --> 38:13.780
that's inexcusable then.

38:13.891 --> 38:15.518
The question would be
why the competition

38:15.593 --> 38:17.561
didn't look into it.

38:17.628 --> 38:19.459
- Hi, Richard Wald?
-Speaking.

38:19.563 --> 38:21.258
-You were the managing editor

38:21.365 --> 38:25.665
at "The New York Herald
Tribune" in '64?

38:25.736 --> 38:27.931
Did "The Tribune"
ever write a story

38:28.039 --> 38:30.974
about how "The Times"
covered the story of 38?

38:31.042 --> 38:34.307
-No, I don't remember
"The Tribune" ever doing that.

38:34.378 --> 38:36.869
Let's assume you were
a reporter on the scene.

38:36.947 --> 38:38.972
If you had a sense
that it didn't happen

38:39.083 --> 38:42.018
that way,
I would have assigned people
to go and check.

38:42.086 --> 38:43.383
- Right.

38:43.454 --> 38:44.478
-But I don't know
any reporter

38:44.588 --> 38:46.112
who felt that way.

38:49.927 --> 38:51.918
- Mr. Pressman.
- Hi, Bill. How are you?

38:51.996 --> 38:53.429
- Good. I'm good.

38:53.497 --> 38:57.934
-In 1964,
I was a reporter at WNBC

38:58.002 --> 39:01.335
and I had no first hand
knowledge of the story

39:01.439 --> 39:04.135
but my friend Danny Meenan
covered the story.

39:04.241 --> 39:06.232
At this point
he was doing radio

39:06.310 --> 39:10.269
I believe for WMCA,
and, uh

39:10.348 --> 39:12.111
among all the police reporters
I've known

39:12.183 --> 39:14.014
and I've known many,
he was one of the best

39:14.118 --> 39:16.416
if not the best.

39:16.487 --> 39:19.285
He said, "The story doesn't make
any sense to me."

39:19.357 --> 39:21.825
And he gave me an account of

39:21.926 --> 39:25.418
uh, what he found.

39:25.496 --> 39:28.522
And it says here,
"There were many witnesses.

39:28.632 --> 39:31.066
"Some 30 odd in the number.

39:31.135 --> 39:34.571
"One conclusion all seemed
to have, it was a drunken brawl

39:34.638 --> 39:36.731
between man and wife."

39:36.807 --> 39:38.468
Martin Gansberg, the author

39:38.542 --> 39:40.669
of the "Page One Story"
in "The Times"

39:40.778 --> 39:43.303
which caused the furor,
was challenged

39:43.381 --> 39:47.010
by this irate reporter.

39:47.118 --> 39:49.916
"Why didn't you include
in your story

39:49.987 --> 39:52.080
"the fact that many
witnesses did not

39:52.156 --> 39:55.182
believe a murder
was taking place? "

39:55.292 --> 39:57.590
Gansberg replied..

39:57.661 --> 40:00.152
"...It would have ruined
the story."

40:04.568 --> 40:06.331
-That to me is incredible.

40:08.506 --> 40:11.202
It's curious to me why,

40:11.308 --> 40:14.300
and I'm not trying
to blame Danny Meenan

40:14.378 --> 40:16.869
or yourself or anybody else
but why --

40:16.981 --> 40:20.815
how come people didn't call
"The Times" out on that?

40:20.885 --> 40:23.046
- Because it was
"The New York Times"

40:23.154 --> 40:25.418
and Danny, you know,

40:25.489 --> 40:28.515
he had to continue
to hold on to his job.

40:28.592 --> 40:30.219
I don't think that he
probably was interested

40:30.327 --> 40:33.854
in taking on Abe Rosenthal
and "The New York Times."

40:33.931 --> 40:36.024
A couple of years passed,

40:36.100 --> 40:38.068
I was teaching a course

40:38.169 --> 40:39.693
and this seemed
to be something

40:39.770 --> 40:42.466
that the class
would want to explore.

40:42.573 --> 40:45.872
A couple of the people
in my class being enterprising

40:45.943 --> 40:48.468
I guess you would say,
called Rosenthal.

40:49.513 --> 40:53.040
And Rosenthal called me.

40:53.117 --> 40:55.779
He was really angry,
he was screaming at me.

40:55.886 --> 40:57.683
"Do you realize," said Rosenthal

40:57.755 --> 41:00.588
"that this story has become

41:00.691 --> 41:03.990
emblematic of a situation
in America? "

41:04.061 --> 41:07.553
"That it's become the subject
of sociology courses

41:07.631 --> 41:09.826
books and articles."

41:09.934 --> 41:12.732
And I think that
that is abhorrent

41:12.803 --> 41:16.000
to anyone
who is interested in truth.

41:18.809 --> 41:20.640
-For me to hear that,
it's just shocking

41:20.744 --> 41:24.236
because I grew up and moved
in certain directions

41:24.315 --> 41:28.012
based on this story
being fact.

41:28.118 --> 41:31.747
But indeed it was
not totally fact.

41:35.593 --> 41:37.959
- Did they say why they just
sat there doing nothing

41:38.062 --> 41:40.496
while that girl
screamed for help?

41:40.564 --> 41:42.657
- They all had
the same answer.

41:42.733 --> 41:44.826
They didn't wanna get involved.

41:44.902 --> 41:46.563
- A young woman
stabbed 14 times

41:46.637 --> 41:48.161
then raped
outside her building.

41:48.272 --> 41:50.297
- While 40 of her neighbors
turned up their TVs

41:50.407 --> 41:52.534
so they couldn't
hear the screams.

41:52.610 --> 41:54.976
- If you're a witness
in one of these things,
you know what you gotta do?

41:55.079 --> 41:56.944
Put on a shirt and tie,
you gotta go down to court --

41:57.014 --> 41:58.003
- So because of a little
inconvenience

41:58.115 --> 41:59.742
you don't wanna get involved?!

41:59.817 --> 42:01.614
- Listen, let me explain
something to you, huh?

42:01.685 --> 42:03.653
Shut up!

42:05.956 --> 42:07.423
-You look at things
that happen in the world

42:07.491 --> 42:10.119
and that's one of the ways
that you decide

42:10.194 --> 42:11.991
what course
you're gonna take.

42:12.096 --> 42:13.688
And if those things
aren't accurate

42:13.764 --> 42:17.131
then you could
chart the wrong course.

42:17.201 --> 42:20.295
If Kitty Genovese

42:20.371 --> 42:22.532
is a name
that immediately summons

42:22.640 --> 42:24.335
something to people's minds

42:24.441 --> 42:27.774
then that thing that gets
summoned should be the truth.

42:33.050 --> 42:34.984
[birds chirping]

42:35.052 --> 42:36.485
- So, that's everyone who,
who saw --

42:36.554 --> 42:38.351
-These are witnesses.

42:38.455 --> 42:41.219
-Witnessed in some way,
at least heard something.

42:41.292 --> 42:45.456
And A.M. Rosenthal's the guy
who wrote "38 Witnesses."
- Right.

42:45.529 --> 42:48.054
-The truth of the matter is,
38 people didn't see it.

42:48.165 --> 42:49.792
- Okay.

42:49.867 --> 42:53.200
Dr. and Mrs. Rubenstein
heard screams, "Help, help

42:53.304 --> 42:54.566
they're killing me."

42:54.638 --> 42:56.265
-You know, I often wondered

42:56.340 --> 42:58.865
how much detail
Billy would get into.

42:58.976 --> 43:01.809
- "He heard a woman scream
at about 3 o'clock."

43:01.879 --> 43:04.313
-So and so did this,
so and so opened the window,

43:04.381 --> 43:08.249
so and so shouted,
so and so --

43:08.352 --> 43:11.344
For what? She's dead.

43:11.422 --> 43:15.882
She's murdered,
you know.

43:15.993 --> 43:18.791
I don't want --
Why do I wanna hear that?

43:18.862 --> 43:22.696
- "Standing over her
and repeatedly striking her.
The girl then --"

43:22.766 --> 43:26.202
-I personally never heard
a story

43:26.270 --> 43:29.296
from my dad's family members
about Kitty.

43:29.406 --> 43:33.365
I think her death
overshadowed her life

43:33.444 --> 43:37.278
for anybody involved with it.

43:37.381 --> 43:39.906
- In some ways there was this
hush-hush about her life

43:40.017 --> 43:42.451
because they couldn't talk
about her death.

43:42.519 --> 43:44.214
It probably made it
more traumatic

43:44.288 --> 43:46.950
because they weren't able
to celebrate her life.

43:47.057 --> 43:49.252
They were focusing
on her death
by hiding the fact

43:49.360 --> 43:50.725
that she was even alive
to begin with.

43:52.630 --> 43:55.793
-I mean, to me,
she's a picture in a magazine.

43:55.899 --> 44:00.233
I know her from things
I read on Wikipedia

44:00.304 --> 44:04.240
or Googled or read randomly
in a book

44:04.308 --> 44:06.469
when I was in high school
in English class

44:06.577 --> 44:07.839
and didn't realize
it was my aunt

44:07.911 --> 44:09.378
until about half-way through.

44:09.446 --> 44:10.913
I know how she died.
- Yeah.

44:10.981 --> 44:12.243
- That's the story
I could tell you.

44:19.590 --> 44:21.387
-Inside, dad?
- Yeah.

44:21.458 --> 44:23.653
[engine whirring]

44:37.341 --> 44:40.538
One more.

44:40.644 --> 44:42.839
As you're beating your head up
against the wall

44:42.946 --> 44:45.437
and having to relive
this murder scene

44:45.516 --> 44:48.110
over and over again, it's like,
you know, you stop and say

44:48.185 --> 44:49.516
"Why the hell
am I doing this?

44:49.620 --> 44:51.815
This is, like, nuts.

44:51.922 --> 44:54.049
I don't know, I guess
the message for me

44:54.124 --> 44:57.287
and why I can't stop until
I feel like it's over.

44:57.361 --> 44:58.555
-Yeah, when is it over?

44:58.662 --> 45:00.254
- I -- I'll know
when it's over.

45:02.633 --> 45:04.794
Let me just describe something
really quickly.

45:04.868 --> 45:06.995
My sister Kitty, for you,
would be

45:07.104 --> 45:09.072
a combination of mom and me.

45:11.141 --> 45:13.473
So imagine that.

45:13.544 --> 45:15.671
Mom and I both get murdered
on the street.

45:21.685 --> 45:24.210
- Well, see, I never knew
it was like that for you.

45:24.321 --> 45:25.686
Like, you've never --

45:25.789 --> 45:28.383
I mean, you've never expressed
it in that way.

45:29.460 --> 45:30.791
- Right.

45:35.999 --> 45:37.626
So the obsessive part of me

45:37.701 --> 45:38.963
that's gotta get
to the end of it

45:39.036 --> 45:40.526
the end isn't reached yet.

45:40.637 --> 45:43.299
There's see -- there's more
bases I'd like to touch.

45:43.373 --> 45:47.173
For instance, like, Kitty
was married, did you know that?

45:47.244 --> 45:49.405
- No, I --
No.

45:54.852 --> 45:57.218
[instrumental music]

46:08.899 --> 46:11.868
-My sister was so much more
than her final 30 minutes.

46:13.771 --> 46:15.261
But in our late-night talks,

46:15.372 --> 46:17.636
her life in the city
barely came up.

46:20.110 --> 46:22.203
All I knew was
she worked in a bar.

46:22.279 --> 46:25.271
Was briefly married
to a man named Rocco.

46:28.352 --> 46:30.843
In the past few years,
journalists have revealed

46:30.921 --> 46:33.856
that her roommate Mary Ann
was actually her lover.

46:36.560 --> 46:38.755
If I didn't know something
as important as that

46:38.862 --> 46:41.057
how well did I really
know my sister?

46:43.901 --> 46:46.199
Even though I haven't seen him
since I was 6

46:46.270 --> 46:48.261
I decided to reach out
to Rocco.

46:51.441 --> 46:54.308
"Dear Rocco, I've been working
with a filmmaker

46:54.411 --> 46:58.507
for several years
on a documentary about Kitty."

46:58.582 --> 47:00.846
"At this point, I have
questions about her life

47:00.918 --> 47:03.443
"in New York
after high school

47:03.554 --> 47:06.045
and I think you hold the key
to the answers."

47:08.292 --> 47:12.126
"William, I respect
the feeling expressed
in your message

47:12.229 --> 47:14.493
"and I ask you do the same
for mine

47:14.565 --> 47:17.329
which are to respect
my desire for privacy."

47:19.303 --> 47:22.568
"My relations with Kitty shall
remain a mystery forever."

47:25.342 --> 47:27.333
[instrumental music]

47:29.980 --> 47:31.743
-Hi, pops.

47:33.083 --> 47:35.449
What are you doing?

47:35.519 --> 47:38.784
- I'm reading through
Kitty's yearbook.

47:38.856 --> 47:42.724
"May we dance forever
on each others' feet"

47:42.826 --> 47:45.192
Love and Stuff, Elsa."

47:49.533 --> 47:51.057
So this is where you went
to high school?

47:51.168 --> 47:53.693
-This is where
we went to high school.

47:53.804 --> 47:56.739
And when we played hooky,
we were in that park.

47:56.807 --> 47:57.774
which we did a lot.

48:00.277 --> 48:03.246
-Did Kitty have any
aspirations of going
to college?

48:03.313 --> 48:04.803
-No.

48:04.882 --> 48:07.749
And it's interesting
because she was smart.

48:07.851 --> 48:11.844
But I don't remember her
ever striving for the "A."

48:11.955 --> 48:14.822
Probably 'cause
we were all cut-ups.

48:14.892 --> 48:17.690
[upbeat music]

48:17.794 --> 48:20.319
Everyone loved Kitty.

48:20.397 --> 48:22.388
She was funny, very witty.

48:24.868 --> 48:26.893
She had an, an enormous
following.

48:30.073 --> 48:32.541
[music continues]

48:35.245 --> 48:38.681
She was a very good mimic
of teachers

48:38.749 --> 48:40.182
particularly
our French teacher.

48:40.250 --> 48:41.842
She would do
the Sid Caesar thing

48:41.919 --> 48:43.580
where she made believe
she was talking French.

48:43.687 --> 48:46.155
[speaking in French]

48:48.492 --> 48:49.857
[music continues]

48:49.927 --> 48:52.623
To be in Kitty's clique
was a big deal.

48:53.997 --> 48:55.487
We played hooky.

48:57.067 --> 48:59.661
We went to the beach

48:59.736 --> 49:01.169
or here in the park

49:01.238 --> 49:03.706
or smoking on the roof.

49:03.774 --> 49:05.799
And she was the head
of the pack.

49:11.882 --> 49:14.976
-So, you first heard
about Kitty's murder --

49:15.052 --> 49:17.247
- I remember reading the obit.

49:17.354 --> 49:21.017
It said that she was a barmaid.
-Yeah.

49:21.091 --> 49:22.058
- Okay?

49:22.125 --> 49:25.561
And, um, I was, I --

49:25.629 --> 49:28.723
I remember thinking,
"What a pity, what a waste"

49:28.799 --> 49:31.097
that she wound up a barmaid.

49:33.971 --> 49:36.804
- I'm Wally Brosnan, Bill.
- Wally, Bill Genovese.

49:36.907 --> 49:38.568
I was a friend
of Kitty's, too.

49:38.642 --> 49:40.769
- Good. Nice to meet you.
- Hiya, Bill.

49:40.877 --> 49:42.344
- Nice to meet you.
- My pleasure.

49:42.412 --> 49:44.346
-Kitty started out
as a bar maid

49:44.414 --> 49:48.350
but eventually she earned
a position as a bar manager.

49:48.418 --> 49:52.377
Her last job was at a tavern
called "Ev's 11th Hour."

49:52.456 --> 49:53.889
Somehow I didn't
imagine this.

49:53.957 --> 49:55.447
The neighborhood's
changed quite a bit.

49:55.559 --> 49:57.925
- Neither did we.
We didn't imagine it either.

49:57.995 --> 49:59.360
- Big difference.

50:01.164 --> 50:02.654
-When did the bar open?

50:02.766 --> 50:04.563
- 8 o'clock in the morning.

50:04.634 --> 50:06.295
- Now, you better
be here at 8:00.

50:06.403 --> 50:08.837
Or else they'll be
knocking down the door.

50:08.905 --> 50:11.738
- Well, what was she like
in there, was she, you know

50:11.808 --> 50:14.140
if there was trouble, did --
did anybody get into fights?

50:14.244 --> 50:17.270
- She cut off what's his name,
Harry Allerman

50:17.347 --> 50:19.645
she cut him off, told him
he couldn't come in anymore.

50:19.750 --> 50:21.081
- Why, what was he doing,
screamin', yellin'?

50:21.151 --> 50:23.312
- Well, you know,
he was just a drunk.

50:23.420 --> 50:24.785
- So would you, would you --

50:24.855 --> 50:26.447
Was she like a tough person
to deal with?

50:26.523 --> 50:29.549
- No!
- She was a pussycat.

50:29.659 --> 50:31.422
-When, uh, when my
last daughter was born

50:31.495 --> 50:33.292
she came to the hospital
with me.

50:33.363 --> 50:34.694
-Oh, really?
- Yeah.

50:34.798 --> 50:36.789
Yeah, she came
to the hospital with me.

50:36.867 --> 50:38.801
-She was just --
she was just good

50:38.869 --> 50:40.666
like, she'd goof with ya.

50:40.771 --> 50:43.706
You know, you'd goof with her
and she -- right back at you

50:43.774 --> 50:46.242
you know, right back at you.

50:46.309 --> 50:47.776
-What was Ev's bar like?

50:47.844 --> 50:51.280
- Uh, it was like,
uh, cheers.

50:51.348 --> 50:54.146
Everybody knows everybody else
and everybody's business.

50:54.217 --> 50:55.809
-Do you think she liked
working there?

50:55.886 --> 50:57.353
- Oh, she loved it. Yeah.
-Yeah?

50:57.454 --> 50:59.922
- Oh, yeah.
That bar was her home.

50:59.990 --> 51:02.151
She was the queen
of the place.

51:02.225 --> 51:05.888
Some of the people at the bar
used to think I was her
boyfriend.

51:05.996 --> 51:07.258
But I don't think
the people at the bar

51:07.330 --> 51:08.456
had any idea she was gay.

51:08.532 --> 51:10.329
- Hmm.

51:10.400 --> 51:13.392
- I don't, in fact,
I'm positive they didn't
know about it.

51:13.503 --> 51:16.597
- Oh, yeah. Everybody
knew that she was gay.

51:16.673 --> 51:18.937
- Oh, really?
-Oh, yeah. Everybody knew.

51:19.009 --> 51:21.842
And let's put it this way,
she was one of the boys.

51:21.912 --> 51:24.506
I mean, guys used to borrow
money off her.

51:24.581 --> 51:26.572
- Borrow money from her?
-Yeah.

51:26.683 --> 51:31.552
Everybody in there gambled
in one way or another.

51:31.655 --> 51:34.317
- Kitty was arrested
for something

51:34.391 --> 51:35.358
or charged with something.

51:35.425 --> 51:37.017
What was that about?

51:37.094 --> 51:38.459
- Not that I knew of.

51:38.562 --> 51:39.756
-What do you guys
know about that?

51:39.863 --> 51:42.491
- No, I don't,
I don't remember that.

51:42.566 --> 51:44.090
-What she would do

51:44.201 --> 51:46.726
people would give her bets
to give to the bookie.

51:46.837 --> 51:47.997
- Hmm.

51:48.071 --> 51:49.595
And she got caught
in the middle.

51:49.706 --> 51:51.401
People were giving
her bets and they said

51:51.508 --> 51:53.203
"You're booking the horses."
That's, that's what happened.

51:53.276 --> 51:56.768
She got locked up or something
for that one time. Yeah.

51:56.880 --> 51:59.075
- I didn't know my sister
was such a racketeer.

51:59.182 --> 52:00.376
[laughing]

52:00.450 --> 52:03.112
[instrumental music]

52:03.220 --> 52:05.381
-Apparently,
Kitty's arrest is the source

52:05.455 --> 52:07.616
of the most famous
picture of her.

52:07.724 --> 52:11.660
For years, I wondered
where did this image
come from?

52:11.728 --> 52:14.390
It wasn't until I looked
closely that I noticed

52:14.464 --> 52:17.900
a piece of string
hanging around her neck.

52:17.968 --> 52:19.799
A piece of string
that would have held up

52:19.903 --> 52:21.598
her arrest identification.

52:23.039 --> 52:24.700
So this was her mug shot.

52:26.443 --> 52:28.274
It's hard for me
to picture that Kitty

52:28.378 --> 52:31.575
when I think about the one
we saw when she come to visit.

52:33.550 --> 52:37.042
She seemed right at home
in that role.

52:37.120 --> 52:39.918
But she also seems to have
thrived in New York City.

52:41.558 --> 52:44.322
Zipping around
in her little red Fiat.

52:45.829 --> 52:48.593
Coming home alone
late at night.

52:49.966 --> 52:52.332
[music continues]

52:56.840 --> 52:59.001
There's one more person
who can tell me more about

52:59.109 --> 53:02.704
Kitty's life in the city,
her lover Mary Ann.

53:04.681 --> 53:07.980
She used to come to New Canaan
with Kitty on weekends.

53:08.084 --> 53:11.451
I assumed
they were just roommates.

53:11.521 --> 53:14.319
After Kitty died, we never
spoke to her again.

53:19.696 --> 53:22.961
She declined to be
interviewed on camera.

53:23.033 --> 53:25.661
But she did agree to let me
record our conversation.

53:30.874 --> 53:32.000
[indistinct chattering]

53:35.145 --> 53:36.635
Mary Ann, I --
I was always curious

53:36.713 --> 53:39.045
how did you and Kitty meet?

53:39.149 --> 53:40.741
-It was either
the Duchess or the Sea Colony

53:40.817 --> 53:42.307
I don't remember the name.

53:42.385 --> 53:43.682
I was sitting at the bar
having a beer

53:43.787 --> 53:45.152
and this woman comes up
to me and said

53:45.222 --> 53:46.519
"Don't I know you
from somewhere? "

53:46.623 --> 53:48.818
I said, "Well, no."

53:48.892 --> 53:51.486
So then I said, "Well, I live
at 74th and Broadway."

53:51.561 --> 53:54.928
I had a room and there's
a payphone across the street.

53:55.031 --> 53:56.896
And so somehow she found it.

53:57.000 --> 54:00.163
So I had a note on the door
when I came back home.

54:00.237 --> 54:02.000
"I'm gonna call you at 7:00
on this payphone."

54:02.072 --> 54:03.903
So she called me.

54:04.007 --> 54:06.475
[telephone ringing]

54:06.543 --> 54:09.876
I fell very much
in love with her. Mmm.

54:11.915 --> 54:14.008
-Do you think Kitty
was in love with you as much?

54:14.084 --> 54:15.608
-I'm not sure.

54:15.719 --> 54:17.880
I think she had conflicts
about being gay.

54:17.988 --> 54:21.116
Because we would have,
we would have arguments
around this.

54:21.191 --> 54:24.524
I think in time,
she would have worked it out.

54:24.594 --> 54:25.959
But she didn't have
the chance.

54:28.698 --> 54:32.361
-On the 13th, did you hear
anything that night?

54:32.435 --> 54:35.734
-This is hard because
I blocked a lot of this out.

54:35.839 --> 54:37.864
The police woke me up.
They knocked on the door.

54:37.941 --> 54:39.772
-Hmm.

54:39.876 --> 54:43.403
-We went down to the morgue,
4 o'clock in the morning.

54:45.115 --> 54:46.776
That's when I identified her.

54:50.020 --> 54:51.647
I remember sitting
outside on the bench

54:51.721 --> 54:54.019
and they said,
"We're gonna take you home."

54:54.090 --> 54:55.455
I said, "No, I'm gonna
wait for her."

54:59.896 --> 55:02.091
-What about Karl Ross,
do you remember him?

55:02.198 --> 55:04.723
-She cried out to him, right?
-Yeah.

55:04.801 --> 55:07.497
-He had the pet shop,
that's how we met him.

55:07.604 --> 55:09.868
-Oh!
-He got the poodle for me.

55:09.939 --> 55:12.407
We had an argument
and she bought it for me.

55:12.475 --> 55:15.103
His name was Andrew.

55:15.211 --> 55:18.840
Somewhere around the funeral,
your father,
he came down there

55:18.915 --> 55:20.940
and he said, "I want the dog
because it's Kitty's."

55:21.051 --> 55:23.178
I said, "No, it's mine."

55:23.253 --> 55:25.244
Thanksgiving afternoon

55:25.322 --> 55:27.813
I woke up, the dog
was just gone.

55:27.924 --> 55:30.449
Just gone.
I never saw him again.

55:30.560 --> 55:33.028
-I remembered,
after Kitty passed

55:33.096 --> 55:35.121
Andrew appears at our house.

55:37.600 --> 55:41.559
And I thought it was my dad's
way of cheering my mother up.

55:41.638 --> 55:44.630
And it did just the opposite.
-Hmm.

55:44.741 --> 55:48.268
-I remember her saying,
"The dog needs to go back."

55:48.345 --> 55:50.836
Then he disappeared.

55:50.947 --> 55:53.245
I can't, I mean,
that's terrible.

55:53.316 --> 55:55.284
I apologize
for my family for that.

55:55.352 --> 55:57.183
That's -- that's awful.

56:02.659 --> 56:05.628
-A trauma can be so bad

56:05.695 --> 56:07.686
that it tears you up,
but somehow you have to heal

56:07.797 --> 56:10.265
but right now,
I haven't healed.

56:10.333 --> 56:12.267
You know, you feel you could
have saved somebody

56:12.335 --> 56:15.168
if you only knew?
That's what I feel.

56:15.271 --> 56:16.738
-I totally understand that.

56:19.476 --> 56:21.273
-I slept with her shirt
for a long time.

56:24.948 --> 56:28.281
-What do you think needs
to happen for you to heal?

56:28.351 --> 56:30.046
[Mary Ann sighs]

56:30.153 --> 56:33.316
-I don't know.
I really don't know.

56:35.358 --> 56:38.384
Have you ever gone
to his parole hearings?

56:38.495 --> 56:40.656
-No.

56:40.730 --> 56:43.494
-Maybe facing him
and seeing this

56:43.566 --> 56:46.933
reprehensible human,
not even human being

56:47.036 --> 56:49.664
would make me say,
"That's it."

56:53.376 --> 56:56.174
-You say that you remember
almost nothing of the murder?

56:57.747 --> 57:00.215
- The details of it, no.

57:00.316 --> 57:01.908
-Uh, it -- it sort of

57:01.985 --> 57:04.112
it -- the length of time

57:04.187 --> 57:06.883
when it was reconstructed
was approximately 32 minutes.

57:06.990 --> 57:09.458
Is a total blank?

57:09.526 --> 57:11.892
- I remember the street.

57:11.995 --> 57:14.759
I remember the act itself..

57:15.765 --> 57:17.289
...but the details, no.

57:17.400 --> 57:20.233
-You remember the act itself?
- Yes.

57:20.336 --> 57:21.701
-And what was it?

57:21.771 --> 57:25.263
- The act was the --
the swinging of a knife.

57:25.375 --> 57:29.141
And that, uh,
really doesn't take a lot

57:29.212 --> 57:31.077
to kill a person, I guess.

57:34.417 --> 57:36.510
-Could anything be gained
from sitting down

57:36.586 --> 57:37.780
with Winston Moseley?

57:40.290 --> 57:40.457
In his 49 years in prison,
I never seriously
considered it.

57:40.457 --> 57:44.450
In his 49 years in prison,
I never seriously
considered it.

57:44.561 --> 57:47.086
After all, Moseley not only
killed my sister

57:47.197 --> 57:48.789
he destroyed my family.

57:52.402 --> 57:54.927
My parents
never really recovered.

57:55.038 --> 57:57.973
My mother had a stroke
the year after Kitty's murder.

58:01.277 --> 58:04.974
My father died of a stroke,
when he was only 59.

58:08.151 --> 58:10.915
My mother's faith got her
through those years

58:10.987 --> 58:13.649
and she said she forgave
Moseley in her heart.

58:17.994 --> 58:20.019
Before I try to meet him
face to face

58:20.129 --> 58:21.596
I need to know more about him.

58:22.966 --> 58:25.332
[instrumental music]

58:31.307 --> 58:34.936
-Winston Moseley
was arrested 5 days
after my sister's murder

58:35.011 --> 58:38.708
while stealing a television
from a house in Queens.

58:38.815 --> 58:42.581
This time, a neighbor
was good enough to intervene.

58:42.652 --> 58:44.813
-How are you, sir?
- I'm good.

58:44.921 --> 58:47.185
- So, he saw Winston
going into the house?

58:47.257 --> 58:50.055
- Well my father was sitting
on a porch like he usually did.

58:50.126 --> 58:53.152
He saw this gentleman
went into Banister's home

58:53.263 --> 58:55.527
and my father says,
"What are you doing here? "

58:55.598 --> 58:58.066
And he made a break
down the hill

58:58.134 --> 58:59.465
and my father catches him

58:59.536 --> 59:02.027
fell on top of him
and he couldn't move.

59:02.138 --> 59:05.107
So he just called
the police department.

59:05.174 --> 59:07.039
They came right away.

59:07.143 --> 59:11.239
They put him in a patrol car
and took him away.

59:11.314 --> 59:14.181
- His demeanor was what?

59:14.284 --> 59:15.546
- He was just
as calm as can be.

59:15.618 --> 59:16.710
-Really?

59:16.786 --> 59:19.050
- Just as calm as can be.

59:19.122 --> 59:22.216
And nobody came to my father's

59:22.292 --> 59:24.920
to the house when we lived here

59:24.994 --> 59:27.019
to sit down and say thank you.

59:27.130 --> 59:28.119
You're the only one.

59:31.467 --> 59:34.630
-Somebody brought
in this small

59:34.704 --> 59:37.298
meek-looking black guy.

59:37.373 --> 59:38.362
And they brought the prisoner

59:38.474 --> 59:40.465
up to the detective office.

59:40.543 --> 59:42.477
One of the detectives
got an idea.

59:42.545 --> 59:44.206
He said,
"Hey, you know that guy

59:44.314 --> 59:46.282
"he looks like
he could be -- match

59:46.349 --> 59:50.587
the description of the --
the person who killed
Kitty Genovese."

59:50.587 --> 59:51.554
the description of the --
the person who killed
Kitty Genovese."

59:51.654 --> 59:54.953
And we started
to question him.

59:55.024 --> 59:57.151
By the time we got done
talking to him

59:57.226 --> 01:00:00.821
we knew we had one of the, uh,
most bloodthirsty killers

01:00:00.897 --> 01:00:02.489
that I had ever met.

01:00:02.565 --> 01:00:03.930
[scanner beeps]

01:00:06.869 --> 01:00:08.234
- Okay.

01:00:08.338 --> 01:00:12.138
- I was sitting
pretty much where you are.

01:00:12.208 --> 01:00:16.702
And Winston Moseley sat in that
table right over there.

01:00:18.448 --> 01:00:20.313
The best word to describe

01:00:20.416 --> 01:00:22.543
Winston Mosley, is ice.

01:00:23.786 --> 01:00:26.220
Nothing fazed him at all.

01:00:26.289 --> 01:00:28.382
Nothing fazed him.

01:00:28.458 --> 01:00:31.222
- My dad was assigned
to represent

01:00:31.294 --> 01:00:33.455
uh, Winston Moseley.

01:00:33.563 --> 01:00:37.055
I was like a junior partner
in the office at the time

01:00:37.133 --> 01:00:40.068
and Moseley was
a very, very bright

01:00:40.136 --> 01:00:43.105
and manipulative individual.

01:00:43.206 --> 01:00:47.199
He had an lQ of 135.
He had two children.

01:00:47.276 --> 01:00:50.370
He had a good, well-paying job.

01:00:50.446 --> 01:00:52.744
He was very soft-spoken.

01:00:52.815 --> 01:00:54.783
The confession as
to Kitty's killing

01:00:54.884 --> 01:00:58.012
just, sort of,
flowed normally as

01:00:58.087 --> 01:01:01.682
as part of...
his conversational tone.

01:01:01.758 --> 01:01:03.885
- So it was, like,
"I stole a TV and, by the way

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:05.052
I killed this person? "

01:01:05.128 --> 01:01:06.755
- Essentially.

01:01:06.829 --> 01:01:08.694
[instrumental music]

01:01:11.901 --> 01:01:14.369
-Moseley also confessed
to the murder of a woman

01:01:14.437 --> 01:01:16.462
named Annie Mae Johnson.

01:01:16.572 --> 01:01:18.369
He murdered her
outside her house

01:01:18.441 --> 01:01:21.137
two weeks
before he killed Kitty.

01:01:21.244 --> 01:01:22.939
According to Moseley,
he approached her

01:01:23.012 --> 01:01:25.845
as she was getting out
of her car at night.

01:01:25.948 --> 01:01:29.281
He shot her four times
in the stomach
with a.22 rifle.

01:01:31.287 --> 01:01:33.448
He then rolled
her body into the house

01:01:33.523 --> 01:01:36.185
and raped her while her
unwitting family members

01:01:36.292 --> 01:01:38.590
were upstairs.

01:01:38.661 --> 01:01:40.322
She was still breathing

01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:42.796
so he wadded up
some newspaper..

01:01:42.865 --> 01:01:45.800
...piled them around her,
and lit the house on fire.

01:01:51.441 --> 01:01:53.909
Two weeks after
he killed Annie Mae Johnson..

01:01:53.976 --> 01:01:56.501
...Moseley crossed
Kitty's path.

01:02:00.817 --> 01:02:02.614
While he was
attacking my sister

01:02:02.685 --> 01:02:05.552
he knew people were watching.

01:02:05.655 --> 01:02:07.589
He heard Robert Mozer
yell down

01:02:07.657 --> 01:02:09.784
from the 7th floor
of the Mowbray.

01:02:11.994 --> 01:02:15.259
He ran to his car,
sat for a few minutes

01:02:15.331 --> 01:02:19.290
and decided that no one
was going to intervene.

01:02:19.368 --> 01:02:21.836
So he changed hats
and headed back

01:02:21.904 --> 01:02:23.769
to rape and murder my sister.

01:02:27.477 --> 01:02:31.345
When he found her inside
the vestibule, Kitty screamed.

01:02:33.349 --> 01:02:35.840
He heard the door open
at the top of the stairs

01:02:35.918 --> 01:02:39.547
but quickly realized Karl Ross
was going to do nothing.

01:02:39.655 --> 01:02:41.520
[music continues]

01:02:43.993 --> 01:02:47.258
As he drove away from
Kew Gardens after the murder

01:02:47.330 --> 01:02:49.423
Moseley crossed paths
with a driver

01:02:49.499 --> 01:02:52.662
who had fallen asleep
at a red light.

01:02:52.735 --> 01:02:56.193
He approached the car..

01:02:56.272 --> 01:02:57.864
...held his knife
out of sight..

01:03:00.743 --> 01:03:04.509
...gently woke
the driver and sent him
safely on his way.

01:03:13.356 --> 01:03:16.814
The jury found Moseley guilty
and sentenced him to death.

01:03:19.629 --> 01:03:22.462
But Moseley appealed
and his sentence was reduced

01:03:22.565 --> 01:03:23.862
to life in prison.

01:03:27.436 --> 01:03:28.903
And that should have been
the last anyone

01:03:28.971 --> 01:03:30.905
heard of Winston Moseley.

01:03:34.377 --> 01:03:38.177
However, in 1968,
Moseley escaped from prison

01:03:38.247 --> 01:03:41.341
and terrorized Buffalo,
New York.

01:03:41.417 --> 01:03:43.408
Over the next four days

01:03:43.486 --> 01:03:47.684
he broke into houses,
raped a woman at gunpoint..

01:03:47.790 --> 01:03:50.486
...and took hostages
when the FBl closed in.

01:03:56.933 --> 01:04:00.425
Neil Welch ran the FBl office
in Buffalo at the time

01:04:00.503 --> 01:04:02.937
and he was the first
to arrive at the scene.

01:04:03.005 --> 01:04:04.597
-And I walked
immediately over

01:04:04.674 --> 01:04:07.472
and stood in the front
of the building..

01:04:07.577 --> 01:04:10.876
...and he said,
"Come in." you know.

01:04:10.947 --> 01:04:14.610
He sat in a chair and
we were about 5 or 6 feet apart

01:04:14.684 --> 01:04:17.881
and he's got the gun
pointed at me.

01:04:17.987 --> 01:04:20.581
I had a gun in my left pocket.

01:04:20.656 --> 01:04:24.114
I had a direct shot
right at him.

01:04:24.193 --> 01:04:26.821
- But, but in that direct
confrontation

01:04:26.929 --> 01:04:29.454
your take on him was..

01:04:29.532 --> 01:04:30.863
- Dangerous.
- Yeah.

01:04:30.967 --> 01:04:32.264
- But..

01:04:34.003 --> 01:04:37.495
Well, I felt comfortable
in talking to him.

01:04:37.607 --> 01:04:39.472
I put my hand out and I said

01:04:39.542 --> 01:04:42.636
"Let me have the gun, Winston."

01:04:42.712 --> 01:04:46.307
You have my guarantee that
you will be treated fairly.

01:04:49.385 --> 01:04:51.979
One thing that l,
I was taken aback with

01:04:52.054 --> 01:04:53.646
was how small he was.

01:04:56.559 --> 01:04:59.187
You know,
I almost expected a larger

01:04:59.295 --> 01:05:01.422
presentation of -- of evil.

01:05:05.301 --> 01:05:09.431
-Since his escape, Moseley
seems to have transformed
himself.

01:05:09.505 --> 01:05:12.201
- I'm going to continue
to try to do positive

01:05:12.308 --> 01:05:14.776
instructive things

01:05:14.844 --> 01:05:17.005
to try to make up
for those crimes.

01:05:17.079 --> 01:05:20.708
-In 1977, he completed
his sociology degree

01:05:20.816 --> 01:05:23.114
from the confines of a cell.

01:05:23.185 --> 01:05:26.211
That year, he also wrote
an editorial
in the New York Times

01:05:26.322 --> 01:05:28.085
claiming he was reformed.

01:05:35.932 --> 01:05:40.028
- This process is, is really,
a -- aimed at helping you.

01:05:40.102 --> 01:05:42.969
We know that by helping you,
we're probably going to help

01:05:43.072 --> 01:05:45.097
Winston, assuming that
he is in a position

01:05:45.207 --> 01:05:47.698
to meet with you voluntarily
and whether or not

01:05:47.777 --> 01:05:49.301
you know, he's remorseful
for what he did.

01:05:49.412 --> 01:05:52.381
So maybe we could start it off
by talking about

01:05:52.448 --> 01:05:54.245
you know, what it is
you're trying to accomplish

01:05:54.350 --> 01:05:57.012
by having a meeting, uh,
with, uh, Winston Moseley.

01:05:57.086 --> 01:05:59.452
- I'm curious as to
what his life was like

01:05:59.555 --> 01:06:01.716
over the last 49 years.

01:06:01.791 --> 01:06:04.089
Here, he murdered two people.

01:06:04.193 --> 01:06:06.058
How does he think about that?
-Mm-hmm.

01:06:06.128 --> 01:06:07.891
- What did he think
about the events?

01:06:07.964 --> 01:06:10.831
If, if he wants to offer that.
-Mm-hmm.

01:06:10.933 --> 01:06:15.802
- If that opens him up to where
he has things he wants to say

01:06:15.905 --> 01:06:18.999
so be it. Let's hear it.

01:06:19.075 --> 01:06:22.875
- What about if he says no,
he's not willing to participate?

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:32.785
- Well, I think
it'd be unfortunate..

01:06:35.925 --> 01:06:37.358
...on one level.

01:06:37.426 --> 01:06:40.122
And then,
on another level I think..

01:06:40.229 --> 01:06:43.062
Well, that's a relief.

01:06:43.132 --> 01:06:45.999
-Drink ourselves funny.
-Did you open my wine?

01:06:46.102 --> 01:06:48.866
-Oh, that one,
you got it.

01:06:48.938 --> 01:06:51.429
- Where's the stuff
on the bottom?

01:06:51.507 --> 01:06:52.531
- Where is it, I don't know.

01:06:52.641 --> 01:06:54.836
- I've got a bowl of pasta

01:06:54.944 --> 01:06:57.640
with no clams.
That's -- how'd you do that?

01:06:57.747 --> 01:06:59.612
-No there is.

01:06:59.682 --> 01:07:01.843
-Uh, some people say
they called the cops

01:07:01.951 --> 01:07:04.545
the cops didn't react
because there was a bar

01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:06.554
in this quiet neighborhood,
there was a bar

01:07:06.622 --> 01:07:08.920
you know, people like,
it's again like a Rorschach

01:07:08.991 --> 01:07:12.358
it's like, what do you see
in this senseless pattern

01:07:12.461 --> 01:07:16.056
so we're trying
to get with Moseley.

01:07:16.132 --> 01:07:18.066
Send him an email.

01:07:19.769 --> 01:07:20.861
- You sent him an email?

01:07:20.936 --> 01:07:21.868
-Yep.
- Wow.

01:07:22.705 --> 01:07:23.865
-Bill.

01:07:26.709 --> 01:07:27.835
- What?
- What?

01:07:27.943 --> 01:07:31.071
- What's the, um..

01:07:31.147 --> 01:07:33.672
What's the question, um..

01:07:33.783 --> 01:07:35.580
What's the question..
What do you want answered?

01:07:35.651 --> 01:07:38.245
At what point are you
going to be satisfied?

01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:40.151
- Well, the thing is,
sadly for me

01:07:40.222 --> 01:07:42.087
one question leads
to another question

01:07:42.191 --> 01:07:44.386
leads to another question
leads to 5 questions

01:07:44.493 --> 01:07:46.654
leads to 10 questions,
and it's, uh

01:07:46.729 --> 01:07:48.526
you know,
it's a geometrical thing.

01:07:48.631 --> 01:07:50.064
- We're now sitting here

01:07:50.132 --> 01:07:51.895
we're still talking about Kitty.

01:07:53.702 --> 01:07:54.999
And I'm okay with that..

01:07:55.071 --> 01:07:57.699
- Yeah.
- But 50 years..

01:07:57.807 --> 01:08:00.901
- If you buried it,
you should have.

01:08:00.976 --> 01:08:03.274
You should have
because it's, it's..

01:08:03.345 --> 01:08:05.336
It's ea -- it's easily

01:08:05.414 --> 01:08:08.247
described as an obsession
on my part.

01:08:08.350 --> 01:08:09.977
- I really need to.

01:08:10.052 --> 01:08:11.747
-Bury it.
- Yeah.

01:08:18.359 --> 01:08:20.350
[phone rings]

01:08:20.429 --> 01:08:22.363
-Hello?
-Uh, hello, Bill.

01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:25.423
Uh, this is Mark Collins,
and Janet is with me as well.

01:08:25.533 --> 01:08:28.469
-Hi, Bill!
- Hi, Janet. How're you doing?

01:08:28.537 --> 01:08:30.129
-Very good. How are you?
- Good.

01:08:30.206 --> 01:08:32.002
-We met
with Winston Moseley.

01:08:32.073 --> 01:08:35.566
We are very, uh..

01:08:35.678 --> 01:08:37.645
...very, uh,
disappointed, however

01:08:37.712 --> 01:08:40.307
as -- as,
as you will be that

01:08:40.381 --> 01:08:43.874
he has chosen
not to pursue a dialogue

01:08:43.953 --> 01:08:46.649
uh, process with you.

01:08:46.755 --> 01:08:49.519
-You know, he was very
clear that he's been contacted

01:08:49.591 --> 01:08:51.719
by multiple media sources

01:08:51.794 --> 01:08:56.662
and he's just, as he put it,
"Tired of being exploited."

01:08:56.765 --> 01:08:58.698
-You know, we know how
important this is for you

01:08:58.767 --> 01:09:01.133
and so it was frustrating
for us to..

01:09:01.237 --> 01:09:04.434
Obviously not nearly as
frustrating as you must feel.

01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:06.701
- So is that
the final w -- word

01:09:06.774 --> 01:09:08.709
or can I write a letter to him?

01:09:08.777 --> 01:09:11.075
-You're certainly
not barred or prohibited

01:09:11.147 --> 01:09:13.774
from writing a letter to him,
I just don't see

01:09:13.883 --> 01:09:15.544
him changing his mind.

01:09:15.618 --> 01:09:18.644
- Yeah. I really appreciate it.
-Okay.

01:09:18.754 --> 01:09:21.279
- Thank you very much.
-Okay, bye-bye, Bill.

01:09:39.908 --> 01:09:41.399
[knock on the door]

01:09:44.913 --> 01:09:46.211
- Hi. Steven?

01:09:46.282 --> 01:09:48.216
- Bill?
- Bill Genovese.

01:09:48.283 --> 01:09:49.716
- Hi, I'm Steven.
- Yes.

01:09:49.785 --> 01:09:51.479
- Nice to meet you.

01:09:51.587 --> 01:09:54.454
- How do you like
to be addressed?

01:09:54.523 --> 01:09:56.457
Reverend?

01:09:56.525 --> 01:10:00.120
Reverend Moseley?
Or Steven Moseley? Or..

01:10:00.196 --> 01:10:02.164
- However you feel
comfortable calling me.

01:10:02.264 --> 01:10:04.732
- Steven, if it's okay.
- That's fine.

01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:07.234
- I thought to be perfectly
straight with you

01:10:07.303 --> 01:10:11.433
and to show you exactly
where I'm coming from

01:10:11.507 --> 01:10:14.601
I spent many, many
hours and days writing this.

01:10:14.677 --> 01:10:16.872
And in some places
it's gonna seem harsh

01:10:16.979 --> 01:10:20.745
but I think that you probably
will be able to read it

01:10:20.816 --> 01:10:24.115
and understand
where I'm coming from.

01:10:34.063 --> 01:10:36.554
- Yeah, I, uh..

01:10:36.665 --> 01:10:39.691
...I see how you feel about,
uh, what happened.

01:10:39.802 --> 01:10:41.827
- Yeah.
- When I was 7 years old.

01:10:41.904 --> 01:10:42.928
- Oh. No, I know.

01:10:43.038 --> 01:10:45.233
I don't hold the son responsible

01:10:45.341 --> 01:10:46.865
for the father's deeds.

01:10:46.976 --> 01:10:49.240
Your dad won't talk to me..

01:10:49.311 --> 01:10:51.973
...and I'm, uh,
trying to find a way

01:10:52.047 --> 01:10:54.038
in my own heart
to forgive him.

01:10:54.149 --> 01:10:57.778
- Can -- can I explain to you
what forgiveness does?

01:10:57.853 --> 01:11:01.050
When you forgive people,
it's for yourself.

01:11:01.156 --> 01:11:02.145
It's for you.
- Yeah.

01:11:02.224 --> 01:11:03.816
- Uh..

01:11:03.892 --> 01:11:06.258
How would you feel
about him getting paroled?

01:11:06.362 --> 01:11:08.159
Because, um...you know

01:11:08.230 --> 01:11:11.427
if it had not been
for the, uh, notoriety

01:11:11.533 --> 01:11:14.195
of this story..

01:11:14.270 --> 01:11:16.238
...he'd have probably been
paroled by now.

01:11:16.338 --> 01:11:18.966
- But see my concern is
there's that part of him

01:11:19.041 --> 01:11:22.169
that seems to be
a very good person

01:11:22.244 --> 01:11:23.836
and there's that part of him

01:11:23.912 --> 01:11:26.210
that maybe
he has no control over

01:11:26.282 --> 01:11:30.742
that really is...for lack of
a better term, a monster.

01:11:32.454 --> 01:11:34.081
- 50 years ago.

01:11:34.189 --> 01:11:39.183
- 50 years ago, but my
concern is, where is he now?

01:11:39.261 --> 01:11:41.695
- Only thing I know
is from what he's told me.

01:11:41.764 --> 01:11:45.461
You know?
He said he just snapped out.

01:11:45.567 --> 01:11:48.764
Because there was some racial
tensions going on back then.

01:11:48.871 --> 01:11:53.808
And your sister was using a lot
of racial slurs at him and

01:11:53.876 --> 01:11:56.868
he just lost it.
That's what he told me.

01:11:56.945 --> 01:11:58.606
- Mm-hmm.
- So I, I don't know.

01:11:58.714 --> 01:12:00.807
- Do you, do you realize
he killed another woman?

01:12:00.883 --> 01:12:02.874
-I.. That's something
that I'm not real

01:12:02.951 --> 01:12:05.749
uh, you know, sure of --

01:12:05.821 --> 01:12:09.985
- And the other, the other
woman was African-American.

01:12:10.092 --> 01:12:13.255
- Okay, well, maybe he did
do that. I don't know, you know?

01:12:13.329 --> 01:12:17.459
-Yeah.
- Uh, that's something
we never discuss.

01:12:17.566 --> 01:12:20.399
Um, I can only imagine
how you feel.

01:12:20.469 --> 01:12:22.403
I don't know,
but I can imagine.

01:12:22.471 --> 01:12:25.565
- Right.
- You took a loss,
your family took a loss.

01:12:25.641 --> 01:12:29.509
And my family took a loss.
You know, it affected everybody.

01:12:29.611 --> 01:12:32.409
My brother and I, we -- we
went through school with

01:12:32.481 --> 01:12:34.346
uh, ridicule.

01:12:34.450 --> 01:12:38.978
Uh, people, you know, they used
to pick with us and call us

01:12:39.088 --> 01:12:41.022
children of a murderer
and all this.

01:12:41.090 --> 01:12:44.423
So, what happened to your sister

01:12:44.493 --> 01:12:47.485
changed my form
of thinking also....you know.

01:12:47.596 --> 01:12:49.120
And I wanted to be
the good guy

01:12:49.198 --> 01:12:52.292
and try to fix
the badness in the world.

01:12:52.368 --> 01:12:55.804
Now, you know, um,
let me just say this here..

01:12:55.871 --> 01:12:57.736
I, I was kind of..

01:12:59.475 --> 01:13:01.909
...apprehensive about
talking to you.

01:13:01.977 --> 01:13:03.410
From what I've understood

01:13:03.479 --> 01:13:07.108
there was a Genovese
crime family.

01:13:07.182 --> 01:13:09.548
Are you related to the crime
family of the Genovese?

01:13:09.651 --> 01:13:10.618
- No, not at all.

01:13:10.686 --> 01:13:12.654
- I've always, uh, been told

01:13:12.721 --> 01:13:16.555
that, that it had been
the, the crime family that was

01:13:16.658 --> 01:13:17.784
you know, that Kitty was from.

01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:19.191
- Steven, between you and me

01:13:19.294 --> 01:13:20.761
it's not true.

01:13:20.829 --> 01:13:22.990
- Everybody in my family
says to me you know

01:13:23.065 --> 01:13:26.432
"You' re crazy, you shouldn't go
there. You may not come back"

01:13:26.535 --> 01:13:28.503
- Ha.

01:13:28.570 --> 01:13:31.664
- I said, "I'm not,
I'm not afraid to die."

01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:35.733
I said, "lf it's my time
to die, I'm ready to go."

01:13:35.844 --> 01:13:37.869
- So you're not only
cordial for coming here

01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:39.641
but you're courageous
for coming here.

01:13:41.083 --> 01:13:45.349
- Yeah, uh...
I know that, uh..

01:13:45.421 --> 01:13:48.185
...at some point
in a person's life

01:13:48.257 --> 01:13:50.885
they have to move on,
you know, and, and

01:13:50.993 --> 01:13:54.190
then you'll have some peace
of mind about it, you know?

01:13:54.263 --> 01:13:57.027
And, you know,
hopefully, you know

01:13:57.099 --> 01:14:00.466
we can put everything that's
happened behind us and move on.

01:14:09.111 --> 01:14:11.944
-About a month after
talking with Steven Moseley

01:14:12.047 --> 01:14:14.345
his father Winston
sent a letter.

01:14:14.416 --> 01:14:16.850
He described in detail
a bizarre version

01:14:16.919 --> 01:14:19.888
of what happened the night
of Kitty's murder.

01:14:19.955 --> 01:14:23.083
According to him,
he was nothing more
than the getaway driver

01:14:23.192 --> 01:14:24.989
for the true killer.

01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:27.153
An ltalian mobster
named Dominic.

01:14:29.398 --> 01:14:32.265
"At that point, Dominic ran
at the woman
and I thought

01:14:32.367 --> 01:14:34.460
"I was seeing him hitting her

01:14:34.536 --> 01:14:39.496
"in her back with his fist.
I didn't know he had a knife.

01:14:39.575 --> 01:14:41.702
""Why? " I asked.

01:14:41.777 --> 01:14:45.440
""She owed me" was all he said.

01:14:45.547 --> 01:14:49.813
"He said to me
in a very menacing way quote

01:14:49.885 --> 01:14:52.319
""Not a word about tonight
to anyone.

01:14:52.387 --> 01:14:54.719
""If you ever mention my name

01:14:54.790 --> 01:14:57.418
""if you talk, you'll be sorry.

01:14:57.493 --> 01:14:59.927
Your family will pay.""

01:14:59.995 --> 01:15:03.294
And then it's
simply signed Winston Moseley.

01:15:06.068 --> 01:15:07.365
Incredible.

01:15:09.638 --> 01:15:12.471
-It's so delusional.
-Yeah.

01:15:12.574 --> 01:15:15.543
It's kind of like, uh,
the human condition.

01:15:15.611 --> 01:15:18.739
One believes their own bullshit
in evolving stories.

01:15:18.814 --> 01:15:22.511
- Amazing. 50 years
and he's come up with this.

01:15:22.618 --> 01:15:23.915
- Yeah.

01:15:26.989 --> 01:15:29.856
[instrumental music]

01:15:56.852 --> 01:15:59.719
[music continues]

01:16:04.393 --> 01:16:07.385
It's hard to let go
when you can never know
the whole truth.

01:16:10.499 --> 01:16:12.296
I'll never be able
to put myself

01:16:12.367 --> 01:16:14.198
in the place of the neighbors.

01:16:14.303 --> 01:16:15.395
- Welcome to our home.

01:16:16.638 --> 01:16:17.969
- This is the bedroom.

01:16:27.583 --> 01:16:28.948
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:16:29.051 --> 01:16:30.985
The one in the bedroom
looks directly down

01:16:31.053 --> 01:16:33.578
at the parking lot.

01:16:33.689 --> 01:16:35.384
-And I can never really know

01:16:35.490 --> 01:16:37.481
what it was like
for Kitty that night.

01:16:39.027 --> 01:16:41.689
What thoughts
went through her mind.

01:16:43.398 --> 01:16:45.764
Only once in 50 years
have I come close

01:16:45.867 --> 01:16:48.529
to understanding.

01:16:48.604 --> 01:16:51.266
It was July, 1967.

01:16:51.373 --> 01:16:53.637
I was on patrol
near an enemy village.

01:16:57.546 --> 01:17:00.413
[intense music]

01:17:10.525 --> 01:17:12.390

01:17:12.461 --> 01:17:14.326
[indistinct chattering]

01:17:21.737 --> 01:17:25.673
Lying in the middle of that
paddy, I was completely alone.

01:17:33.115 --> 01:17:34.980
I thought of Kitty.

01:17:40.589 --> 01:17:43.524
What was it like for her
when she realized

01:17:43.592 --> 01:17:45.457
no one was going to save her?

01:17:50.332 --> 01:17:53.267
[instrumental music]

01:17:53.335 --> 01:17:56.202
But Marines
carried me to safety

01:17:56.304 --> 01:17:59.273
and I lived
to tell the story.

01:17:59.341 --> 01:18:01.775
- Whatever possessed you to go
running off into the paddy like
that?

01:18:01.843 --> 01:18:04.505
- I'm a marine.
-How do you mean?

01:18:04.613 --> 01:18:06.308
- I'm a marine.
I'll take care of 'em.

01:18:06.415 --> 01:18:08.679
[indistinct chattering]

01:18:28.470 --> 01:18:32.668
After 50 years, I felt
there was one more thing
I had to do.

01:18:40.015 --> 01:18:42.040
- Hi, how are you?
- Good. How are you?

01:18:42.150 --> 01:18:43.845
- I'm Shannon.
- Pleased to meet you, Shannon.

01:18:43.952 --> 01:18:45.112
- Nice to meet you.
- Beeby?

01:18:45.187 --> 01:18:46.449
- Yes.

01:18:46.521 --> 01:18:49.456
[phone ringing]

01:18:49.524 --> 01:18:51.458
-Hello.
- Michael?

01:18:51.526 --> 01:18:53.858
-Yes.
- It's Bill Genovese.

01:18:53.962 --> 01:18:56.954
I'm here with a woman
named Shannon Beeby

01:18:57.032 --> 01:19:00.365
and she is going
to act out the

01:19:00.469 --> 01:19:03.597
vocalizations here
on the street.

01:19:03.672 --> 01:19:07.108
So of course the only person
we really have..

01:19:07.175 --> 01:19:08.665
...is yourself,
who can give us a -- an idea

01:19:10.378 --> 01:19:14.007
of how loud was it
in your apartment.

01:19:14.082 --> 01:19:17.916
-The scream was so loud

01:19:18.019 --> 01:19:21.318
that it woke me up
from a dead sleep.

01:19:21.389 --> 01:19:25.553
I've never heard anything
in my life that loud.

Help me!

01:20:40.936 --> 01:20:43.905
Oh, my God, please help me.

01:20:43.972 --> 01:20:46.736
Please, help me!

01:20:46.808 --> 01:20:48.844

01:22:19.334 --> 01:22:21.199

- Bill, how you doing?
How's everything?

01:22:40.221 --> 01:22:42.314
- Good.
- Good to see you.

01:22:44.225 --> 01:22:45.522
- This is unbelievable.

01:22:45.593 --> 01:22:47.083
- I know.

01:22:47.195 --> 01:22:47.963
She was my friend
and I knew she was hurt.

01:22:47.963 --> 01:22:50.193
She was my friend
and I knew she was hurt.

01:22:50.265 --> 01:22:52.859
And l..
And she needed help.

01:22:52.934 --> 01:22:54.799
That was -- that was my reason

01:22:54.903 --> 01:22:57.997
for flying down those stairs.

01:22:58.073 --> 01:22:59.904
And then when I came in

01:22:59.975 --> 01:23:02.000
I'll never forget the black..

01:23:06.281 --> 01:23:07.983
It kills me
when I think about it.

01:23:07.983 --> 01:23:09.211
It kills me
when I think about it.

01:23:09.284 --> 01:23:12.811
The black leather gloves
and all cuts

01:23:12.921 --> 01:23:16.357
all through the gloves
on her both hands.

01:23:17.826 --> 01:23:19.953
[sobbing]
I only hope

01:23:20.061 --> 01:23:22.393
that she knew it was me.

01:23:22.464 --> 01:23:24.659
That she wasn't alone.

01:23:26.935 --> 01:23:28.003
-This is the youngest, Frank

01:23:28.003 --> 01:23:29.265
-This is the youngest, Frank

01:23:29.337 --> 01:23:31.498
and this is the oldest, Vin.

01:23:31.606 --> 01:23:34.040
So it was Kitty, Vin, Susan

01:23:34.109 --> 01:23:35.770
Bill and then Frank.

01:23:35.844 --> 01:23:38.472
This is our granddaughter.
-Oh, she's beautiful.

01:23:42.150 --> 01:23:44.914
-I've come to realize
that the whole truth

01:23:44.986 --> 01:23:47.750
about Kitty's death
will never be known.

01:23:47.822 --> 01:23:48.023
But maybe that's why the story
continues to fascinate people.

01:23:48.023 --> 01:23:51.459
But maybe that's why the story
continues to fascinate people.

01:23:51.526 --> 01:23:52.959
- You really only
had to know one thing

01:23:53.028 --> 01:23:56.964
to appreciate how
misleading that lead was.

01:23:57.032 --> 01:23:58.966
-And if nothing else,
it got us

01:23:59.034 --> 01:24:01.525
to think about
what we owe each other.

01:24:01.636 --> 01:24:03.570
- To not only be vigilant
but to get involved

01:24:03.638 --> 01:24:06.766
and to help in
any capacity that we can.

01:24:10.045 --> 01:24:12.912

01:24:16.684 --> 01:24:20.142
-50 years
after Kitty's death,
I still miss her.

01:24:25.026 --> 01:24:27.562
I wish she had the chance
to know her nieces
and nephews.

01:24:27.562 --> 01:24:28.119
I wish she had the chance
to know her nieces
and nephews.

01:24:30.865 --> 01:24:33.834
To meet her grand-niece
who's named after her.

01:24:35.637 --> 01:24:37.605
But this journey
has taught me and my family

01:24:37.672 --> 01:24:39.867
more about Kitty than
we ever thought we'd know.

she really took

01:24:54.489 --> 01:24:57.925
a-a liking to Billy,
more than me.

01:24:57.992 --> 01:24:59.584
-Although I remember,
one time

01:24:59.661 --> 01:25:01.492
I didn't eat
my spaghetti and she

01:25:01.563 --> 01:25:03.588
dumped the spaghetti
on my head.

01:25:03.698 --> 01:25:07.156
-Yes! Really?
-Yeah.

01:25:07.235 --> 01:25:07.602
Kitty taught me to never
stop asking questions.

Kitty taught me to never
stop asking questions.

she'd want me to move on.
