and destruction are likely

What parts of a child's urge

18:49.777 --> 18:51.947
Well, there is a groundbreaking
experiment

18:51.980 --> 18:53.615
that shed light on this.

18:53.647 --> 18:57.586
In 1961, Albert Bandura
conducted a famous

18:57.618 --> 19:02.991
and controversial study
called the Bobo Doll Experiment.

19:03.023 --> 19:06.694
<i>He had adults act violently
to an inflatable clown doll</i>

19:06.728 --> 19:08.563
<i>in the presence of children.</i>

19:08.596 --> 19:11.732
<i>Then left the children alone
with the same doll</i>

19:11.765 --> 19:14.301
<i>to see if they would mimic
the destructive behavior</i>

19:14.335 --> 19:16.004
<i>they'd observed.</i>

19:16.037 --> 19:19.975
<i>Disturbingly, the children
did indeed copy the adults,</i>

19:20.008 --> 19:21.910
<i>and lashed out at the doll,</i>

19:21.943 --> 19:24.779
<i>often getting very creative
with their aggression</i>

19:24.811 --> 19:27.581
<i>and destruction.</i>

19:27.615 --> 19:30.952
Aggression comes in many
unexpected forms.

19:30.984 --> 19:35.389
Why is it so hard to resist

Do we like the sound?

19:38.492 --> 19:41.328

Or both?

19:41.361 --> 19:43.764
It's like we're naturally drawn
to destroying

19:43.798 --> 19:46.768
these harmless plastic bubbles
of air.

19:46.800 --> 19:50.038
Destructive tendencies seem
to be so engrained in us

19:50.070 --> 19:53.274
that we even respond
to positive stimulation

19:53.308 --> 19:55.343
with urges to destroy.

19:55.376 --> 19:58.312
One of the strangest things
about destruction

19:58.346 --> 20:01.816
is how people want to hug things
to death,

20:01.848 --> 20:04.852

extremely cute,

20:04.886 --> 20:06.421

20:06.453 --> 20:08.322
We don't know exactly why
this is,

20:08.356 --> 20:10.759
but there is a study
that demonstrates the effect

20:10.791 --> 20:15.329
