00:03.041 --> 00:04.834
Previously on Mech-X4.

00:04.917 --> 00:06.208
(Ryan)
I have a gift.

00:06.291 --> 00:09.000
I can control technology
with my mind.

00:09.083 --> 00:11.417
(Leo) Mech-X4 can only
be piloted by you.

00:11.500 --> 00:13.709
Reach out to it
with your power.

00:13.792 --> 00:14.834
(Ryan)
I'm a technopath!

00:14.917 --> 00:16.625
(Leo) You cannot imagine
the horrors coming.

00:16.709 --> 00:17.709
(roars)

00:17.792 --> 00:19.917
Monsters as big as the robot,
if not bigger!

00:20.000 --> 00:22.166
(Principal Grey)
The city has a robot defender.

00:22.250 --> 00:25.709
The next monster I make
will tear that robot apart!

00:27.000 --> 00:29.125
(school bell rings)

00:31.625 --> 00:33.375
Hey, guys, okay,
I can't believe,

00:33.458 --> 00:35.333
we saved this place
from total destruction

00:35.417 --> 00:37.000
and we can't tell anybody!

00:37.083 --> 00:38.083
Right?

00:38.166 --> 00:40.000
I wanted to meet
Neil deGrasse Tyson!

00:40.083 --> 00:42.750
And Selena Gomez.
Not in that order.

00:42.834 --> 00:44.125
You know, were
we supposed to keep

00:44.208 --> 00:45.917
the whole Mech-X4 thing
a secret?

00:46.000 --> 00:47.917
Spyder, what did you do?

00:48.000 --> 00:50.583
Cassie Park, here
with the brave crew of Mech-X4...

00:50.667 --> 00:54.041
Ryan Walker, Harris Harris Jr.,
and, eh, some other kid.

00:54.125 --> 00:55.667
-She sort of knows who I am!
-No.

00:55.750 --> 00:58.291
How does it feel to be
the hero of Bay City?

00:58.375 --> 00:59.959
(Students)
Ryan! Ryan!

01:00.041 --> 01:03.667
Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan!

01:03.750 --> 01:07.959
Ryan! Ryan!
Ryan! Ryan!

01:08.041 --> 01:10.750
Ryan! Ryan! Ryan!

01:10.834 --> 01:12.125
For saving our lives,

01:12.208 --> 01:14.709
for being a hero...

01:16.083 --> 01:19.083
here's a street performer
doing the robot...

01:19.166 --> 01:20.959
(whistles)

01:21.041 --> 01:24.000
I get it! He's a robot,
I have a robot.

01:24.083 --> 01:25.959
...a veggie burger
that actually tastes good...

01:26.041 --> 01:27.291
That's impossible.

01:27.375 --> 01:29.917
...and a check
for one million dollars!

01:31.041 --> 01:32.917
-(Principal Grey) Whoo!
-That's awesome!

01:33.000 --> 01:34.875
Ryan! Ryan!

01:34.959 --> 01:37.709
(All)
Ryan! Ryan! Ryan!

01:37.792 --> 01:42.000
Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan!

01:42.083 --> 01:44.750
(Woman)
Ryan. Ryan. Ryan!

01:44.834 --> 01:45.917
Ryan, wake up!

01:47.125 --> 01:48.333
What?

01:48.417 --> 01:49.750
It was just a dream?

01:49.834 --> 01:51.709
Does it end with you
being late for school?

01:51.792 --> 01:53.375
'Cause that's where
it gets real, kiddo.

01:53.458 --> 01:55.166
-Come on. Let's go, Ry-Guy.
-(sighs)

01:56.083 --> 02:00.458
(Students) (echoing)
Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! Ryan!

02:00.542 --> 02:02.125
(theme music playing)

02:21.125 --> 02:22.667
(Grace)
Here you go, boys.

02:25.959 --> 02:27.166
Uh, breakfast on a stick?

02:27.250 --> 02:29.834
No, the Break-Fa-Kabob.

02:29.917 --> 02:31.875
It's a new breakfast food

02:31.959 --> 02:33.709
I'm selling on my food truck.
Try it.

02:35.750 --> 02:37.041
This is good.

02:37.125 --> 02:38.125
Plus, one hand free

02:38.208 --> 02:40.625
-for texting at the table.
-No texting at the table. Down.

02:40.709 --> 02:42.750
No texting at the table.
Got it.

02:44.625 --> 02:46.291
Wait, dude. Check the TV.

02:49.208 --> 02:51.417
Mech-X4 almost
destroys a school,

02:51.500 --> 02:53.834
risking the lives
of all inside.

02:53.917 --> 02:56.291
Now, half of you think
that robot is a hero,

02:56.375 --> 02:57.750
but the other half...

02:57.834 --> 02:58.792
Imagine for a second

02:58.875 --> 03:00.667
a robot foot comes
flying out of the sky.

03:00.750 --> 03:01.875
You think drivers are bad?

03:01.959 --> 03:03.166
Oh, watch out.

03:03.250 --> 03:04.625
It stepped on my baby!

03:05.792 --> 03:07.083
Is what I'm afraid could happen.

03:07.166 --> 03:08.375
(sighs)

03:08.458 --> 03:10.834
It was pretty scary.

03:10.917 --> 03:12.625
Those are my kids, you know?

03:12.709 --> 03:14.834
Parents trust me with them.

03:14.917 --> 03:17.208
I'm just glad
no one was hurt.

03:18.458 --> 03:20.333
Until we get answers,
I don't want to say

03:20.417 --> 03:25.000
that Bay City needs to live in fear,
but Bay City needs to live in fear.

03:25.083 --> 03:26.083
(scoffs)

03:26.166 --> 03:27.834
What is he talking about?

03:27.917 --> 03:29.208
I saved the school.

03:29.291 --> 03:30.375
I saved everybody.

03:30.458 --> 03:32.375
Well, I fixed the robot
so you could beat the monster,

03:32.458 --> 03:34.125
so technically that means
I saved everyone.

03:34.208 --> 03:36.333
No. This is not cool.

03:36.417 --> 03:39.792
We need to get out there and make sure
that people know Mech-X is a hero.

03:40.834 --> 03:41.834
Yeah.

03:44.166 --> 03:49.959
The most important thing...

03:50.041 --> 03:52.875
Still no matches
on the face recognition app.

03:52.959 --> 03:54.583
How is this possible?

03:54.667 --> 03:56.125
Who is this guy?

03:57.875 --> 03:59.417
What else did he want to say?

03:59.500 --> 04:00.583
I mean, it could be anything

04:00.667 --> 04:03.333
like, "Press the red button
and the robot explodes."

04:03.417 --> 04:05.041
-(beeping)
-Wha...

04:05.125 --> 04:06.834
No, that's a seat warmer.

04:07.959 --> 04:08.917
Oh yeah, that's nice.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.792
Sorry I'm late. I was doing cooler,
Mark Walker stuff.

04:11.875 --> 04:12.834
We doing this?

04:12.917 --> 04:15.000
Harris, the video can wait.

04:15.083 --> 04:17.250
Really?
This guy built a robot

04:17.333 --> 04:19.041
specifically for a technopath.

04:19.125 --> 04:20.000
Why?

04:20.083 --> 04:22.500
To protect Bay City.
And how are we gonna do that

04:22.583 --> 04:23.917
if people think
we're the threat?

04:24.000 --> 04:25.417
We need people to like us.

04:25.500 --> 04:27.625
We should teach
the robot how to wink

04:27.709 --> 04:29.500
because people love it
when I wink.

04:29.583 --> 04:30.417
-Mm-mm.
-No.

04:30.500 --> 04:32.041
That was the scariest thing
I've ever seen.

04:32.125 --> 04:33.583
-Mm-mm.
-Don't do that again.

04:33.667 --> 04:36.041
Ryan, this is me
you're talking to.

04:36.125 --> 04:39.041
When you say "us,"
you mean "you," right?

04:39.125 --> 04:42.583
No. No, I mean Mech-X4.

04:42.667 --> 04:45.583
Harris, are you really okay
with people being afraid of us?

04:45.667 --> 04:46.917
Fine.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
But only while facial recog' is running.
As soon as it gets a match...

04:50.083 --> 04:51.667
Let's gooooo.

04:51.750 --> 04:52.792
Yeah, let's do this.

04:53.792 --> 04:55.166
Let's be heroes.

04:58.917 --> 05:00.625
-Give me the purse, old lady!
-What are you doing?

05:00.709 --> 05:02.333
-Give me the purse!
-Let go of my purse,

05:02.417 --> 05:03.709
-you rude young man!
-(clang)

05:10.625 --> 05:11.750
Ah, ah, ah.

05:26.417 --> 05:28.834
(tree rustles)

05:33.000 --> 05:34.542
(children scream)

05:36.000 --> 05:37.542
-(chuckles)
-(Woman) Run!

05:54.542 --> 05:56.583
Ah, there it is.

05:56.667 --> 05:58.333
(Drone)
Here's your coffee, Mr. Harper.

05:59.166 --> 06:01.500
Mm. Delicious.
Jessica, what have we got?

06:01.583 --> 06:03.542
Mr. Harper, if you could
thumbprint sign here.

06:03.625 --> 06:04.917
-Boing.
-And here.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.125
-Yup.
-And here.

06:06.208 --> 06:08.875
Running out of thumbs, Jessica.
Hold up.

06:08.959 --> 06:09.875
What did I just buy?

06:09.959 --> 06:11.834
A company that recycles hot dog water.

06:11.917 --> 06:13.375
Mm. Well...

06:13.458 --> 06:15.542
people like hot dogs,
they need water...

06:15.625 --> 06:17.333
-It'll catch on.
-(man wailing)

06:17.417 --> 06:18.500
-Aah!
-(Harper) Whoa!

06:18.583 --> 06:19.625
(gasps)

06:21.542 --> 06:22.500
He's a beautiful man.

06:22.583 --> 06:24.375
-Put him down easy.
-I know. Hold on.

06:24.458 --> 06:26.875
-(small thump)
-(People) Wow! Oh, my gosh!

06:26.959 --> 06:30.709
-That was incredible!
-Did you see?

06:30.792 --> 06:34.625
Jessica, did that robot
just save Marty?

06:34.709 --> 06:36.041
Yes...

06:36.125 --> 06:38.458
and now it's doing
some sort of victory dance.

06:38.542 --> 06:40.166
♪ I did it,
I did it ♪

06:40.250 --> 06:42.166
Look at him go!

06:42.250 --> 06:44.125
People shouldn't be
afraid of this.

06:44.208 --> 06:46.750
You... you know
that Godfrey person

06:46.834 --> 06:48.709
who keeps saying that
the robot is evil?

06:48.792 --> 06:52.750
Tell him I have
an announcement to make.

06:55.750 --> 06:56.834
He's doing it!

06:59.500 --> 07:00.792
You see that, Harris?

07:00.875 --> 07:03.792
Your hero, Seth Harper,
is giving us the thumbs up.

07:03.875 --> 07:05.542
I know.

07:05.625 --> 07:08.458
I just want to grab that thumb
and shake that hand.

07:08.542 --> 07:10.166
No! Stop that!

07:10.250 --> 07:12.166
You're doing that thing
where you suck me into

07:12.250 --> 07:13.959
your crazy plans
because they're fun.

07:14.041 --> 07:15.250
It was fun.

07:15.333 --> 07:16.625
But irresponsible.

07:16.709 --> 07:18.667
Which is why it was fun.

07:18.750 --> 07:20.500
No. I need to get
back to that video

07:20.583 --> 07:21.959
and unlock its secrets.

07:22.041 --> 07:24.333
Sure. As soon as
we hit the X deck,

07:24.417 --> 07:28.667
turn on the TV, and soak in
some of that hometown love.

07:28.750 --> 07:30.792
Fear...

07:30.875 --> 07:34.041
is what Bay City
should be feeling right now.

07:34.125 --> 07:35.917
They're more scared than ever!

07:36.000 --> 07:38.375
More scared than ever.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.959
And yet, Bay City's favorite son,

07:41.041 --> 07:43.083
Seth Harper from Harper Futuristics,

07:43.166 --> 07:47.375
has his usual, delusional take on it.

07:47.458 --> 07:48.959
I saw you, Mech-X4.

07:49.041 --> 07:50.750
I saw you save Marty.

07:50.834 --> 07:52.792
-Did we save a Marty?
-(grunts "I don't know")

07:52.875 --> 07:54.458
You fascinate me!

07:54.542 --> 07:56.333
And like everyone else
in Bay City,

07:56.417 --> 07:58.750
I just want to know
more about you.

07:58.834 --> 08:00.125
So, mm, five-ish,

08:00.208 --> 08:02.417
I'm inviting you to
my estate to learn.

08:02.500 --> 08:05.875
But mostly, I want to say
thank you.

08:05.959 --> 08:07.500
And I will say,
"You're welcome."

08:07.583 --> 08:08.875
What are you talking about?

08:08.959 --> 08:12.333
We're going to let him know
that we're the heroes inside Mech-X4.

08:12.417 --> 08:14.041
I'm inviting you to my estate...

08:14.125 --> 08:16.917
Now that I know
where that robot will be,

08:17.000 --> 08:19.792
I can destroy Mech-X4...

08:21.542 --> 08:23.959
in front of its biggest fan.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.667
Are you kidding me?

08:28.750 --> 08:31.542
You want to reveal
our secret identities! For what?

08:31.625 --> 08:32.792
So you can become famous?

08:32.875 --> 08:34.041
Trust me,
it's pretty awesome.

08:34.125 --> 08:36.750
No, people are scared
of Mech-X4.

08:36.834 --> 08:38.959
They think it could be
an alien or evil.

08:39.041 --> 08:40.709
Or an unstoppable
killing machine

08:40.792 --> 08:42.125
from the future.

08:42.208 --> 08:43.667
I have been reading
the message boards.

08:43.750 --> 08:45.750
But if they see
the human face of Mech-X4,

08:45.834 --> 08:46.834
they'll be less scared.

08:46.917 --> 08:48.208
Yeah, especially if it's this face.

08:48.291 --> 08:50.166
It'll be all of our faces.

08:50.250 --> 08:53.208
You're not doing this
to make people less scared.

08:53.291 --> 08:54.750
You want a victory lap.

08:54.834 --> 08:56.750
What, not enough
trophies at home?

08:56.834 --> 08:58.417
So why not make
Mech-X4 one?

08:58.500 --> 09:01.792
-Zing!
-Shoots and scores.

09:01.875 --> 09:04.875
Okay, let's take a vote.
All in favor of proving we're not evil.

09:06.792 --> 09:08.041
At Harper's estate?

09:08.125 --> 09:09.125
(sighs)

09:09.208 --> 09:12.000
I'm not some vending machine
you technopathically push around.

09:12.083 --> 09:14.542
Weirdly stated, but okay.

09:14.625 --> 09:16.709
If you need me,
I'll be trying to figure out

09:16.792 --> 09:18.834
why that guy in the video
built Mech-X4,

09:18.917 --> 09:20.583
because I'll tell you one thing:

09:20.667 --> 09:22.792
it's not for fame.

09:27.667 --> 09:28.917
(clang)

09:30.625 --> 09:32.875
Come on, Harris.
You're not always right.

09:32.959 --> 09:35.375
If that's the case,
why do you always cheat off me?

09:35.458 --> 09:37.750
'Cause you're always
more right than me!

09:37.834 --> 09:39.333
What are you doing?

09:39.417 --> 09:41.667
That video was filmed
somewhere here.

09:41.750 --> 09:43.542
The clues are in this image.

09:44.750 --> 09:45.750
(sighs)

09:46.959 --> 09:47.917
Hey.

09:49.291 --> 09:51.208
(Spyder) Come on, man!
You're gonna mis all the fun.

09:51.291 --> 09:53.458
-This is important.
-Well, what are we doing here?

09:53.542 --> 09:54.875
Triangulating distances.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.375
-It's called algebra.
-(chuckles) "'Bra."

09:58.458 --> 10:00.041
-You can leave.
-Okay.

10:00.125 --> 10:01.667
Bye, Harris!

10:01.750 --> 10:02.750
(sighs)

10:08.625 --> 10:09.917
Oh!

10:21.417 --> 10:23.834
(gasps, squeals)

10:23.917 --> 10:27.250
All right, the video file's
gotta be on one of these drives.

10:27.333 --> 10:29.750
Harris...

10:29.834 --> 10:31.500
let's do the work.

10:33.583 --> 10:36.375
Hello, Mr. Harper, everyone.

10:36.458 --> 10:38.333
I'm Ryan Walker and it...

10:38.417 --> 10:40.625
Ugh, it sounds like
I'm at a funeral.

10:40.709 --> 10:41.917
Okay.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.083
Bay City,

10:43.166 --> 10:44.917
are you ready...

10:45.000 --> 10:46.166
(voice cracks)
to rock?

10:46.250 --> 10:49.417
And the crowd goes
into a coma!

10:50.834 --> 10:53.333
Look, I get it.
You're excited.

10:53.417 --> 10:55.834
I mean, I'm used to
being the center of attention,

10:55.917 --> 10:57.041
but it's new for you.

10:57.125 --> 10:58.667
Is this your first pep talk?

10:58.750 --> 11:00.041
'Cause you're terrible at it.

11:00.125 --> 11:02.709
When I was nervous before a game,
you know what Dad used to tell me?

11:02.792 --> 11:04.291
-What?
-No matter what,

11:04.375 --> 11:07.667
stand tall, be confident,
and see your victory.

11:07.750 --> 11:10.959
Now, imagine yourself
in the palm of that robot.

11:11.041 --> 11:12.500
Okay, okay, yeah.

11:12.583 --> 11:13.875
And it lowers us
down to the ground,

11:13.959 --> 11:16.333
it opens its hands
in front of all those people.

11:16.417 --> 11:17.417
Cool, right?

11:17.500 --> 11:19.083
Very. Okay, then?

11:19.166 --> 11:21.834
Then they go,
"Oh, man! Is that Mark Walker?

11:21.917 --> 11:24.375
He's so cool! He must be
the pilot of Mech-X4!

11:24.458 --> 11:27.417
Mark! Mark! Mark!
Mark! Mark! Mark! Mark!"

11:27.500 --> 11:28.458
Good talk, bro!

11:28.542 --> 11:30.875
"Mark! Mark! Mark! Mark! Mark!"

11:32.458 --> 11:33.875
That was a terrible talk.

11:36.125 --> 11:37.500
(sighs)

11:41.417 --> 11:42.917
Nothing.

11:43.750 --> 11:45.250
And this was the last one.

11:49.166 --> 11:50.417
What?

11:51.500 --> 11:53.166
Oh, man.

11:56.875 --> 11:58.792
Hey, any chance
to get Harris to come?

12:02.709 --> 12:03.667
(beep, chime)

12:03.750 --> 12:05.709
(whoosh)

12:11.834 --> 12:12.875
Whoa.

12:12.959 --> 12:14.709
(gasps)

12:16.291 --> 12:17.291
"Leo"?

12:18.792 --> 12:20.333
His name was Leo.

12:21.917 --> 12:23.166
(gasps)

12:30.834 --> 12:32.166
(gasps)

12:35.375 --> 12:37.792
(gasps)

12:39.458 --> 12:40.583
Yes!

12:41.625 --> 12:42.792
Just doesn't feel right.

12:42.875 --> 12:44.792
You guys can make up
after we're back.

12:44.875 --> 12:45.834
Let's get famous.

12:45.917 --> 12:47.792
Well, you guys get famous.

12:47.875 --> 12:49.041
I'm a legend.

12:50.750 --> 12:51.834
All right.

12:53.583 --> 12:54.709
Show time.

12:54.792 --> 12:55.875
(beeping)

12:57.709 --> 12:59.917
Mech-execute!

13:00.000 --> 13:02.250
The most important thing

13:02.333 --> 13:05.667
is the monsters are sent
by people, terrible people.

13:05.750 --> 13:07.667
That's why I built Mech-X4...

13:07.750 --> 13:10.041
so you could stop them, Ryan.

13:10.125 --> 13:13.500
Wait, did he just
say Ryan's name?

13:13.583 --> 13:15.542
So you could
stop them, Ryan.

13:15.625 --> 13:17.333
But you have to keep
your identity a secret.

13:17.375 --> 13:18.458
If they know
you're in there,

13:18.542 --> 13:20.125
these people will strike
directly at you

13:20.208 --> 13:21.625
and everyone you know.

13:21.709 --> 13:23.125
Oh no.

13:26.917 --> 13:27.792
(whoosh)

13:31.083 --> 13:32.458
(loud thumping)

13:37.875 --> 13:39.917
Ha!

13:40.000 --> 13:41.291
-(loud thumping)
-(phone vibrates)

13:41.375 --> 13:43.000
(phone chimes)

13:43.083 --> 13:46.125
Do not reveal yourselves.

13:46.208 --> 13:49.291
You are in danger.

13:49.375 --> 13:50.834
Uh...

13:54.542 --> 13:56.166
(sighs)

13:56.250 --> 13:57.834
Desperate times.

13:59.875 --> 14:00.709
(ding ding)

14:03.458 --> 14:05.000
I did say 5:00, right?

14:05.083 --> 14:06.792
-Yes.
-Right.

14:06.875 --> 14:10.750
So how does it feel to
get stood up at your own party?

14:10.834 --> 14:12.667
No need to be smug, Godfrey.

14:12.750 --> 14:14.333
Could just be fashionably late.

14:14.417 --> 14:16.417
-(scoffs)
-(mocks scoff)

14:17.959 --> 14:19.667
What are we waiting for?

14:20.917 --> 14:22.375
To be fashionably late.

14:22.458 --> 14:25.417
Is this your first time
being invited to a party?

14:25.500 --> 14:26.625
Yeah.

14:27.834 --> 14:28.834
(ding ding)

14:32.125 --> 14:33.667
Well, what do you mean
no entrance?

14:33.750 --> 14:34.917
I'm Cassie Park.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.834
I broke the story on Mech-X4.

14:36.917 --> 14:38.917
Good for you.
Private meeting.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.625
-(ding ding)
-Well, what about that girl?

14:40.709 --> 14:42.500
I'm a boy
on a girl's bike!

14:42.583 --> 14:44.917
-(ding ding)
-And that was sexist!

14:46.125 --> 14:47.291
Shoot.

14:48.375 --> 14:51.208
Well, I guess we may as well
wrap this up.

14:55.875 --> 14:58.792
Ooh-hoo! Magnificent!

14:59.959 --> 15:02.125
Look at that technology!

15:02.208 --> 15:03.792
I wonder what it is.

15:03.875 --> 15:04.875
Ratings.

15:04.959 --> 15:05.875
That's what!

15:05.959 --> 15:07.917
You better get this.
Get all of this!

15:08.000 --> 15:10.458
You made it! Fantastic!

15:10.542 --> 15:14.041
First off, thank you
for coming, Mech-X4!

15:14.125 --> 15:16.583
I... I know that
some people are afraid of you!

15:16.667 --> 15:18.959
What is your secret agenda?

15:19.041 --> 15:20.875
But I want to change all that!

15:20.959 --> 15:22.834
Maybe if we got
to know you more!

15:22.917 --> 15:24.709
Where are you from?
Are you alive?

15:24.792 --> 15:26.208
Are... are you
remote controlled?

15:26.291 --> 15:28.542
Are you here to enslave us?

15:28.625 --> 15:31.208
(Mark) Well, what are you waiting for?
Fame awaits!

15:31.291 --> 15:32.875
Yeah, let's do this!

15:34.709 --> 15:36.792
I just... I wish
Harris was here.

15:40.083 --> 15:41.250
(ding)

15:42.792 --> 15:45.792
Hey! Look at your phone!

15:45.875 --> 15:48.583
-I think he is.
- Look at your phone!

15:49.792 --> 15:51.333
"Look at your phone."

15:54.792 --> 15:56.750
"You're in danger.

15:56.834 --> 15:58.417
Do not reveal yourselves."

15:58.500 --> 16:00.917
Dude, this again?
Lighten up!

16:02.041 --> 16:03.875
(loud thump)

16:30.709 --> 16:32.959
-No!
-Harris!

16:43.834 --> 16:45.166
He's dead.
No, no, no, no.

16:46.750 --> 16:48.875
He told us not to do this.

16:55.750 --> 16:56.709
(growls)

16:56.792 --> 16:58.417
-Whoa!
-Aah!

16:58.500 --> 17:00.333
(Ryan)
He told us and...

17:00.417 --> 17:02.291
I didn't listen, and now he's...

17:02.375 --> 17:03.625
-Ryan!
-He's dead.

17:03.709 --> 17:06.000
We're under attack.
We need you.

17:06.083 --> 17:07.458
People are in danger.

17:07.542 --> 17:08.750
Ryan!

17:10.667 --> 17:12.250
(growls)

17:18.917 --> 17:21.208
This thing killed Harris!

17:21.291 --> 17:23.583
Wait, wait.

17:23.667 --> 17:25.333
-What?
-Zoom in!

17:25.417 --> 17:26.625
(coughs)

17:29.166 --> 17:30.792
See? He's still moving!

17:30.875 --> 17:32.250
Well, let's keep him that way!

17:32.333 --> 17:33.667
Ryan!

17:33.750 --> 17:35.709
Ryan, help!

17:35.792 --> 17:37.667
He's gonna get
crushed down there!

17:37.750 --> 17:39.667
Okay, I'll get him.
Just give me cover.

17:39.750 --> 17:41.417
-You got it.
-Mark, please!

17:42.500 --> 17:43.834
He's our best friend.

17:44.792 --> 17:46.333
And this is my fault.

17:51.250 --> 17:53.125
-That thing is dangerous.
-Get him!

17:55.125 --> 17:56.208
-(ding ding)
-Down!

17:56.291 --> 17:57.667
(ding ding)

17:57.750 --> 18:00.083
-(window shatters)
-That robot is trying to kill us!

18:00.166 --> 18:01.125
No, look!

18:01.208 --> 18:03.208
It's trying to save us!

18:03.291 --> 18:05.125
Sir, we need to
get you to safety!

18:05.208 --> 18:06.792
-And me?
-I suppose.

18:06.875 --> 18:07.959
Go!

18:13.834 --> 18:14.875
Oh!

18:15.875 --> 18:17.750
Ugh! It's so... (spits)

18:17.834 --> 18:20.000
so, so gross!

18:20.083 --> 18:22.125
I'm trying to keep him away,
but without Harris,

18:22.208 --> 18:23.583
we don't have anyone
manning shields.

18:23.667 --> 18:25.208
Well, someone
has to protect them!

18:25.291 --> 18:26.458
-(loud thump)
-Aah!

18:27.834 --> 18:30.041
This is worse
than my mom's cooking!

18:31.834 --> 18:32.875
Whoo!

18:32.959 --> 18:34.000
Go for it, Mark!

18:38.208 --> 18:39.417
He's out!

18:40.792 --> 18:41.917
Harris!

18:42.917 --> 18:44.166
-Harris!
-Mark!

18:46.750 --> 18:47.875
Ow!

18:50.709 --> 18:51.875
(monster growls)

18:53.667 --> 18:54.875
-Aah!
-Whoa!

19:00.834 --> 19:02.083
Harris!

19:02.166 --> 19:03.542
You're okay!

19:03.625 --> 19:04.917
Uh, awkward.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.750
I'm fine too, everybody.

19:06.834 --> 19:08.291
N... not the time!

19:08.375 --> 19:09.750
Not the time!

19:19.291 --> 19:21.083
All right, let's focus!

19:21.166 --> 19:22.500
Any advice, dude?

19:22.583 --> 19:23.959
Let's be heroes.

19:24.041 --> 19:25.542
(exhales)

19:31.375 --> 19:32.542
Let's end this!

19:32.625 --> 19:35.458
Have I shown you guys
what I call the Plasma Ax?

19:35.542 --> 19:38.250
When did you have time
to figure out we had a Plasma Ax?

19:38.333 --> 19:39.542
I do stuff.

19:39.625 --> 19:40.709
(beep)

19:44.250 --> 19:46.625
Mech-execute!

19:59.041 --> 20:00.834
-Yes!
-Yes!

20:00.917 --> 20:01.917
(screams)

20:02.000 --> 20:03.375
(grumbles)

20:08.792 --> 20:09.709
Everyone safe?

20:09.792 --> 20:11.625
Yeah, dude.
How about you?

20:11.709 --> 20:13.583
A little beaten up.

20:13.667 --> 20:15.625
But if everyone's okay...

20:15.709 --> 20:17.333
I'm great.

20:21.709 --> 20:22.709
(gasps)

20:24.834 --> 20:26.041
How amazing.

20:27.792 --> 20:29.500
Well, fixing this
is gonna take a while.

20:29.583 --> 20:31.750
Hey, thanks for the save.

20:31.834 --> 20:34.000
Yeah, man. We're teammates.

20:35.000 --> 20:37.542
So, um, people are
making these monsters?

20:37.625 --> 20:39.792
And that guy in the video knew

20:39.875 --> 20:42.542
you would be the technopath
that piloted Mech-X4.

20:42.625 --> 20:44.000
He knew your name.

20:44.083 --> 20:46.750
Yep, creepy.
Borderline illegal.

20:46.834 --> 20:49.291
-Huh.
-Somebody is planning something big.

20:49.375 --> 20:50.667
We have to fight smarter.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.792
You're the smartest guy I know

20:52.875 --> 20:54.834
and you were awesome out there.

20:54.917 --> 20:57.125
-(Godfrey) Standing...
-Hey, guys, they're talking about us.

20:57.208 --> 21:00.000
...and a girl's bike goes
flying past my head.

21:00.083 --> 21:01.417
I didn't panic.

21:01.500 --> 21:05.792
Instead, I saved Seth Harper
and his assistant.

21:05.875 --> 21:08.792
But that Mech-X4 is dangerous.

21:09.792 --> 21:11.125
No.

21:11.208 --> 21:13.417
I don't care about what they say.

21:13.500 --> 21:15.083
We know who we are.

21:15.166 --> 21:16.583
And we need to
keep that a secret.

21:16.667 --> 21:18.500
You know, sorry you didn't get to
meet Harper, dude.

21:18.583 --> 21:20.709
Yeah, or his assistant Jessica.

21:20.792 --> 21:23.917
I mean, seriously, am I the only one
noticing the ladies?

21:24.000 --> 21:25.583
(sighs)
Best friends?

21:26.709 --> 21:27.917
-Best friends.
-Yep.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.375
Three equally good friends.

21:29.458 --> 21:31.250
Uh, probably impossible
to rank us.

21:31.333 --> 21:32.375
Yup.

21:33.417 --> 21:34.750
Right?

21:56.041 --> 21:57.375
Ow!

21:57.458 --> 21:58.834
Ugh.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.709
(end music playing)

22:31.792 --> 22:33.250
(barks)
