WEBVTT

00:01.302 --> 00:04.572
Previously on Salvation...
(screams)

00:04.605 --> 00:07.141
GRACE: Last night,
someone tried to kill me.

00:07.175 --> 00:08.609
Grace, we're gonna find out
who targeted you.

00:08.642 --> 00:10.178
There'll be hell to pay.

00:10.211 --> 00:11.212
For the record,

00:11.245 --> 00:13.214
that kiss between Liam and me,

00:13.247 --> 00:14.415
it didn't mean anything.

00:14.448 --> 00:15.616
What if you could
make a difference?

00:15.649 --> 00:16.650
Right here,

00:16.684 --> 00:18.052
with me.

00:18.086 --> 00:19.053
I'm in.

00:19.853 --> 00:21.622
Theresa.
Grace, this is

00:21.655 --> 00:23.091
Lazlo's sister, Tess.

00:23.124 --> 00:24.825
GRACE: You were in love
with her, weren't you?

00:24.858 --> 00:26.527
If you tell me to stop, I will.

00:26.560 --> 00:27.428
GRACE:
What if I don't?

00:27.461 --> 00:30.064
I think we've had
enough collaboration

00:30.098 --> 00:31.532
with Tanz Industries
for one lifetime.

00:31.565 --> 00:33.501
HARRIS:
He's the secretary of defense.

00:33.534 --> 00:35.469
I can't overrule him,
even if I wanted to.

00:35.503 --> 00:37.405
We're gonna have
to extract the crystal

00:37.438 --> 00:40.174
from Nicholas Tanz, my uncle.

00:40.208 --> 00:41.275
MAN:
What's the plan?

00:41.309 --> 00:42.710
Retribution.

00:42.743 --> 00:44.145
We have liftoff.

00:45.213 --> 00:47.181
FLIGHT DIRECTOR:
We have EmDrive thrust.

00:47.215 --> 00:48.349
TANZ:
Now we can celebrate.

00:48.382 --> 00:50.384
The president is ill.

00:50.418 --> 00:53.254
I fear she's not in a position
to make the best decisions.

00:53.287 --> 00:55.523
Tess unlocked your would-be
assassin's phone.

00:55.556 --> 00:58.459
The call came from
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

00:58.492 --> 01:00.261
The White House.

01:02.163 --> 01:04.232
(Grace moaning)

01:09.237 --> 01:12.640
* When we fall,
we close our eyes... *

01:12.673 --> 01:15.443
You're sure about this?

01:15.476 --> 01:17.445
No.

01:17.478 --> 01:21.282
* And when you see,
you call my name *

01:21.315 --> 01:25.153
* Breaking past
your different ways *

01:25.186 --> 01:28.222
* Go get your healer...

01:28.256 --> 01:29.823
We stopped in Moscow.

01:29.857 --> 01:32.126
* Go get your healer

01:32.160 --> 01:33.594
We can stop now
if you want.

01:33.627 --> 01:36.564
* Go blame it
on the other side, no *

01:36.597 --> 01:37.531
No.

01:37.565 --> 01:41.202
* Go blame it
on the other side, no... *

01:41.235 --> 01:43.604
What about Harris?

01:43.637 --> 01:45.673
HARRIS:
What about me?

01:48.609 --> 01:49.643
I told you...

01:49.677 --> 01:52.146
you liked him too much.

01:52.180 --> 01:54.648
(gasps)

02:15.603 --> 02:17.505
(coughs)

02:17.538 --> 02:20.741
What the hell do you think
you're doing? (coughs)

02:20.774 --> 02:21.909
BENNETT:
Nice morning for a swim,

02:21.942 --> 02:23.677
Randall.

02:25.746 --> 02:28.449
I'm not in the mood
for your games, Bennett.

02:30.851 --> 02:32.186
What is it you want?

02:32.220 --> 02:33.787
What I want?

02:33.821 --> 02:37.625
I think it's about
what you want.

02:37.658 --> 02:39.660
I'm hearing a lot
of chatter

02:39.693 --> 02:41.895
that you're having
second thoughts.

02:41.929 --> 02:43.764
Things are in
motion, Randall.

02:43.797 --> 02:45.333
Already in play.

02:45.366 --> 02:46.500
Yes, I'm aware.

02:46.534 --> 02:48.636
So, why don't you
just sit tight,

02:48.669 --> 02:50.971
and not rock the boat?

02:51.004 --> 02:53.341
Or next time,

02:53.374 --> 02:54.775
you won't need the towel.

03:07.255 --> 03:08.522
Hey.

03:08.556 --> 03:09.823
Oh, "hey"?

03:09.857 --> 03:11.725
What happened to,
"Good morning, Mom"?

03:11.759 --> 03:16.530
(sighs) Were you
going through my purse?

03:16.564 --> 03:17.765
Uh, yeah.

03:17.798 --> 03:19.867
Can I borrow $20?
Haven't got paid yet.

03:19.900 --> 03:21.569
Have to stop for gas.

03:21.602 --> 03:23.237
Sure.

03:23.271 --> 03:25.906
Where you off to?

03:25.939 --> 03:27.375
Late for work.

03:27.408 --> 03:28.242
Zo.

03:28.276 --> 03:30.644
Wait, you're not
wearing your uniform.

03:30.678 --> 03:31.945
Yeah, it's in my trunk.

03:31.979 --> 03:33.847
I'll throw it on
when I get there.

03:39.853 --> 03:40.854
(elevator bell dings)

03:44.525 --> 03:46.760
(ears ringing)

03:46.794 --> 03:49.697
If you tell me to stop, I will.
GRACE: What if I don't?

03:53.834 --> 03:55.002
He's early.

03:57.638 --> 03:59.673
(door opens)

03:59.707 --> 04:01.675
TANZ: I thought we
should go through this

04:01.709 --> 04:02.676
before we, uh...

04:02.710 --> 04:04.011
Yeah.
The goal,

04:04.044 --> 04:05.313
obviously...

04:05.346 --> 04:06.680
To get a meeting with her.

04:06.714 --> 04:09.049
I just know they're
not telling us everything.

04:09.082 --> 04:09.850
Of course they're not.

04:09.883 --> 04:11.552
But the gravity tractor
is sailing

04:11.585 --> 04:12.853
towards our
asteroid friend,

04:12.886 --> 04:14.688
so all is going
to plan up there.

04:14.722 --> 04:16.557
Let's just make sure
all is going to plan

04:16.590 --> 04:18.892
down here.
Are you sleeping okay?

04:18.926 --> 04:20.828
Hmm? Yeah.

04:20.861 --> 04:21.895
Just, um,

04:21.929 --> 04:24.965
having weird dreams.
(chuckles)

04:24.998 --> 04:26.567
I can imagine.

04:28.068 --> 04:29.703
(knock on door)

04:29.737 --> 04:31.605
They're ready for you.

04:33.374 --> 04:34.975
CLAIRE:
A meeting...

04:35.008 --> 04:36.910
with the president?

04:36.944 --> 04:38.512
Yes, we have some business
to discuss.

04:38.546 --> 04:39.647
In light of our service

04:39.680 --> 04:42.416
to country, this should be
fairly simple to arrange.

04:42.450 --> 04:44.017
CLAIRE: Of course,
President Mackenzie

04:44.051 --> 04:45.719
is grateful for your service.

04:45.753 --> 04:46.987
Launching the gravity tractor
as you did

04:47.020 --> 04:48.722
was a coup, to be sure,

04:48.756 --> 04:50.458
but as you can imagine,
she's extremely

04:50.491 --> 04:51.459
pressed for time.

04:51.492 --> 04:52.593
I'd have to know the purpose

04:52.626 --> 04:53.661
of such a meeting.

04:57.498 --> 05:00.568
Three days ago,
someone tried to kill me.

05:00.601 --> 05:01.769
A pro.

05:01.802 --> 05:02.803
My God.

05:05.639 --> 05:06.707
We traced incoming calls

05:06.740 --> 05:07.741
to the assassin's phone.

05:07.775 --> 05:09.076
We don't know
who made them,

05:09.109 --> 05:10.778
but we do know
where they came from.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.546
The White House.

05:12.580 --> 05:14.815
The only way to get

05:14.848 --> 05:16.784
to the bottom of this
is to go to the top.

05:16.817 --> 05:19.119
I've known the president since
she was Governor Mackenzie.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.788
I was a big supporter.
She'll see me.

05:20.821 --> 05:23.824
I'm afraid it's not quite
that simple, Mr. Tanz.

05:23.857 --> 05:24.858
The president...

05:24.892 --> 05:26.527
is unwell.

05:28.896 --> 05:30.864
Meaning?

05:30.898 --> 05:32.500
Sometimes she's confused.

05:32.533 --> 05:34.502
Not mentally sharp.

05:34.535 --> 05:35.836
What?

05:35.869 --> 05:39.373
She has good days,
but she also has bad days.

05:39.407 --> 05:40.808
How long has this been going on?

05:40.841 --> 05:42.676
Long enough.

05:42.710 --> 05:43.877
We're gonna have to
keep this under wraps

05:43.911 --> 05:46.046
until the current crisis
subsides.

05:46.079 --> 05:49.683
You understand why this must
remain in this room.

05:49.717 --> 05:50.751
Of course, yeah.

05:50.784 --> 05:52.420
Um, we appreciate your time.

06:04.998 --> 06:06.434
We need to talk.

06:08.101 --> 06:09.937
I call bull.

06:09.970 --> 06:11.472
I call bureaucracy.

06:11.505 --> 06:12.773
She's covering her ass.

06:12.806 --> 06:14.107
Or someone's.

06:14.141 --> 06:15.776
Sounds like a Monday
at the Pentagon.

06:15.809 --> 06:17.511
Every day at
the Pentagon actually.

06:17.545 --> 06:19.847
Claire's the gatekeeper.

06:23.451 --> 06:26.053
If we can't get
to the president,

06:26.086 --> 06:29.990
let's bring the
president to us.

06:30.023 --> 06:32.660
(phone ringing)

06:34.662 --> 06:35.896
Hello?

06:35.929 --> 06:39.467
TANZ:
Amanda, this is Darius Tanz.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.469
I've been waiting for your call.

06:41.502 --> 06:42.770
The wait's over.

06:42.803 --> 06:44.538
You wanted a source
on the record.

06:44.572 --> 06:46.907
You just got one.

06:50.611 --> 06:53.180
(man speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

06:53.213 --> 06:55.849
Hey.
Jillian, I have
some good news

06:55.883 --> 06:58.018
I wanted to
share with you.

06:58.051 --> 06:59.953
We pulled off the launch.

06:59.987 --> 07:01.789
The EmDrive is working.

07:01.822 --> 07:03.023
That's amazing.

07:03.056 --> 07:04.124
(laughs): I know.
How long

07:04.157 --> 07:06.026
until you know if
it's working working?

07:06.059 --> 07:07.961
Uh, like, a few weeks.

07:09.997 --> 07:12.800
Well, thank you for telling me.

07:12.833 --> 07:16.937
Look, and, Jillian,
what happened with Amanda...

07:16.970 --> 07:18.906
I only kissed her
as a distraction

07:18.939 --> 07:20.574
so that I could
clone her phone.

07:20.608 --> 07:22.042
Sounds like it was horrible.

07:22.075 --> 07:23.711
Really took one for the team.

07:23.744 --> 07:25.245
I don't care about her.

07:25.278 --> 07:27.147
I care about you.
You're all I think about.

07:28.682 --> 07:30.017
Hey, kiddo.

07:30.050 --> 07:31.785
You coming, J?
Ton to do.

07:31.819 --> 07:33.120
I'll be right there.

07:35.222 --> 07:36.790
He calls you "J"?

07:36.824 --> 07:38.058
Did-did he just
call me "kiddo"?

07:38.091 --> 07:40.494
Liam, can we not
do this, please?

07:42.029 --> 07:45.065
I've got work to do
and so do you.

07:51.104 --> 07:52.973
ED:
Darius Tanz said all this?

07:53.006 --> 07:55.008
Mm-hmm. On tape

07:55.042 --> 07:57.077
and on the record.

07:57.110 --> 07:58.779
Holy hell.

07:58.812 --> 08:00.781
I don't know how you did it,
Amanda, but...

08:00.814 --> 08:03.651
you're gonna win
a Pulitzer for this.

08:03.684 --> 08:04.852
Let's run it.

08:04.885 --> 08:06.019
You do the honors.

08:06.053 --> 08:07.788
Okay.

08:11.124 --> 08:13.160
Guessing this is
gonna set off alarms

08:13.193 --> 08:16.129
in some pretty
high places.

08:17.197 --> 08:18.666
CLAIRE:
What are you suggesting,

08:18.699 --> 08:20.901
Harris?
I'm not suggesting anything.

08:20.934 --> 08:22.035
I'm asking a question.

08:22.069 --> 08:24.304
Are we putting hits
on our own citizens?

08:24.337 --> 08:25.606
I need answers

08:25.639 --> 08:26.907
and I need them now.

08:26.940 --> 08:29.309
Um...

08:29.342 --> 08:31.845
There's a certain group,

08:31.879 --> 08:33.581
within the inner circle,

08:33.614 --> 08:34.915
that has taken
this opportunity...

08:34.948 --> 08:36.083
Opportunity?

08:36.116 --> 08:38.018
You mean what's happening
with the president's health?

08:38.051 --> 08:39.620
Yes.

08:39.653 --> 08:41.154
And the current crisis.

08:41.188 --> 08:42.790
I would have said
it was impossible

08:42.823 --> 08:44.725
a few months ago,
but after what happened

08:44.758 --> 08:47.227
to Grace,
I don't know what to think.

08:47.260 --> 08:48.896
Who's in this inner circle?

08:54.001 --> 08:55.969
I don't know exactly.

08:56.003 --> 08:57.705
I've been marginalized,
Harris.

08:57.738 --> 09:00.140
There's so much secrecy,
I can't tell you

09:00.173 --> 09:01.942
who's even pulling the strings
at this point.

09:01.975 --> 09:03.711
But I do know one thing.

09:03.744 --> 09:06.013
Calhoun is involved.

09:07.681 --> 09:09.349
(knock on door)

09:09.382 --> 09:11.819
Yeah?

09:13.854 --> 09:17.090
Sir, this
just came in.

09:21.662 --> 09:23.864
Darius Tanz just called
a live press conference.

09:27.935 --> 09:30.270
Two days ago, Capitol Eyes News

09:30.303 --> 09:33.040
published a story
alleging that in 2013,

09:33.073 --> 09:36.143
the United States used a device
called a gravity tractor

09:36.176 --> 09:38.011
to guide an asteroid

09:38.045 --> 09:39.980
into Chelyabinsk, Russia.

09:40.013 --> 09:43.183
Today I'm going on record
to say that this story is true.

09:43.216 --> 09:44.818
Pentagon Press Secretary

09:44.852 --> 09:46.687
Grace Burrows and I

09:46.720 --> 09:48.889
traveled to Russia
and learned firsthand

09:48.922 --> 09:51.224
that Tanz's
guidance system technology

09:51.258 --> 09:53.026
was found embedded

09:53.060 --> 09:54.294
in meteorite fragments...
(door opens)

09:54.327 --> 09:55.929
...in Chelyabinsk.

09:55.963 --> 09:58.165
I had no foreknowledge of this.
Damn it.

09:58.198 --> 09:59.733
What the hell is he doing?

09:59.767 --> 10:00.834
What Darius always does.

10:00.868 --> 10:02.670
Whatever the
hell he wants.

10:02.703 --> 10:04.237
We are trying to put out a fire.

10:04.271 --> 10:06.239
And he is throwing gasoline
on it.

10:06.273 --> 10:08.008
I've got to reach the president

10:08.041 --> 10:09.209
before she sees this.

10:09.242 --> 10:10.778
Harris,

10:10.811 --> 10:12.079
we need to close ranks.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.346
Now, you gather the troops.

10:13.380 --> 10:16.083
If anyone so much as breathes
to the press

10:16.116 --> 10:17.350
about Atlas, Tanz,

10:17.384 --> 10:19.119
I want their head on a spike.

10:19.152 --> 10:21.254
(drops remote)

10:21.288 --> 10:25.192
We should have dealt with him
when we had the chance.

10:27.127 --> 10:29.096
(door opens)

10:29.129 --> 10:30.864
Okay, I'll take questions now.

10:30.898 --> 10:31.899
(all clamoring)

10:31.932 --> 10:33.867
Yes, Sarah?

10:33.901 --> 10:37.070
Mr. Tanz, the president claims
that Project Atlas is a fiction.

10:37.104 --> 10:40.073
Well, the president is seriously
misinformed or lying.

10:40.107 --> 10:41.875
Either way, I'd love
to talk to her about it.

10:41.909 --> 10:43.877
She knows where to find me.

10:43.911 --> 10:46.046
President Mackenzie,

10:46.079 --> 10:48.348
if you're watching, I'll
be sitting by the phone,

10:48.381 --> 10:50.818
waiting for your call.

10:50.851 --> 10:52.820
Thank you all, have a great day.

10:52.853 --> 10:54.922
(indistinct chatter,
cameras clicking)

10:56.289 --> 10:57.457
What the hell was that?

10:57.490 --> 10:59.126
You want a meeting
with the president?

10:59.159 --> 11:01.128
(chuckles)
Go big or go home.

11:01.161 --> 11:02.429
If they weren't
after us before,

11:02.462 --> 11:04.164
why don't you just
put a target on our backs?

11:04.197 --> 11:05.833
It's already there, Grace.

11:05.866 --> 11:08.368
I just made sure everyone
else knows about it.

11:08.401 --> 11:12.139
That way, if anything
happens to us,

11:12.172 --> 11:13.874
we've left breadcrumbs
through the woods

11:13.907 --> 11:15.008
that lead all the way
back to the White House.

11:15.042 --> 11:16.376
They'll think twice

11:16.409 --> 11:19.212
before sending another hit squad
out to do their bidding.

11:19.246 --> 11:21.248
You really think
that stunt's gonna work?

11:21.281 --> 11:23.383
I lit the fuse. I-I predict
the bomb will go off

11:23.416 --> 11:26.153
in five, four, three...

11:26.186 --> 11:28.455
(doors open)
two...

11:28.488 --> 11:29.990
Darius Tanz.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.992
Agent Davis,
U.S. Secret Service.

11:32.025 --> 11:35.195
The president would like
to see you and Ms. Barrows, now.

11:40.033 --> 11:42.035
*

11:59.252 --> 12:01.088
Ms. Barrows, Mr. Tanz.

12:01.121 --> 12:05.158
Madam President,
it's so good to see you again...

12:05.192 --> 12:07.260
Do you realize
the damage you've done?

12:07.294 --> 12:09.462
Going on television to
corroborate fake news

12:09.496 --> 12:11.164
from some gossip rag?

12:11.198 --> 12:12.432
You've emboldened our enemies.

12:12.465 --> 12:14.434
Undermined us.

12:14.467 --> 12:18.972
And now I have to answer
for crimes I did not commit.

12:19.006 --> 12:21.809
Do you want to tell me what
the hell is going on here?

12:38.425 --> 12:40.260
Hey, Tess,
you're a woman, right?

12:40.293 --> 12:42.195
TESS: I'm an exascale
computing system,

12:42.229 --> 12:44.798
designed to run logic patterns
and programmed algorithms.

12:44.832 --> 12:46.433
Right, okay, so I guess
you can't give me the odds

12:46.466 --> 12:48.268
on Jillian taking me back.

12:48.301 --> 12:50.103
I'm sorry. I don't have
those variables.

12:50.137 --> 12:53.240
All right, well, here's
a variable for you: Mason.

12:53.273 --> 12:54.975
That guy calls me "kiddo."

12:55.008 --> 12:56.276
(chuckles softly)

12:56.309 --> 12:59.412
And he's got a nickname
for Jillian, too: J.

12:59.446 --> 13:01.248
J. And I--

13:01.281 --> 13:03.250
don't you hate people
who give nicknames? It's like

13:03.283 --> 13:05.185
they're trying to own you, like
you're their pet or something.

13:05.218 --> 13:07.254
It's so...

13:07.287 --> 13:08.956
Ugh, it's so arrogant,
don't you think?

13:08.989 --> 13:10.190
I'm sorry, Liam.

13:10.223 --> 13:11.992
What was the question?

13:13.360 --> 13:15.528
Forget it.
Tess, forget it.

13:15.562 --> 13:18.231
Um, how are the calculations
going for the braking burn

13:18.265 --> 13:19.366
for the gravity tractor?

13:19.399 --> 13:20.567
Calculations are complete.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.502
I just need your authorization

13:22.535 --> 13:24.537
to upload the commands.

13:27.240 --> 13:28.541
(sighs)

13:28.575 --> 13:32.112
Done... and done.

13:32.145 --> 13:33.313
(computer beeping)

13:35.615 --> 13:39.119
That's weird.

13:39.152 --> 13:41.221
If there were a shred of truth
to Atlas, don't you think I,

13:41.254 --> 13:43.223
above all people, would know?

13:43.256 --> 13:46.426
TANZ: Project Atlas
is very real, I assure you.

13:46.459 --> 13:49.062
And whoever's behind it
has gone to incredible lengths

13:49.096 --> 13:52.232
to keep it a secret
from everyone,

13:52.265 --> 13:53.901
including you, it would seem.

13:53.934 --> 13:56.436
That's a hell of an
accusation, Mr. Tanz.

13:56.469 --> 13:58.005
Unless, of course,

13:58.038 --> 13:59.272
you're part of the conspiracy

13:59.306 --> 14:00.573
to spread lies,

14:00.607 --> 14:02.242
undermine public confidence

14:02.275 --> 14:05.178
with a doctored-up photo
of some meteor?

14:05.212 --> 14:07.047
Madam President,
we went to Russia,

14:07.080 --> 14:08.348
saw the rock

14:08.381 --> 14:10.450
with Darius's
technology embedded in it.

14:10.483 --> 14:12.219
This is not some conspiracy.

14:12.252 --> 14:13.453
I fear the real conspiracy

14:13.486 --> 14:15.588
is the one going on
behind these very doors.

14:18.291 --> 14:20.260
What are you talking about?

14:23.296 --> 14:24.664
(exhales)

14:24.697 --> 14:27.400
Someone killed a man by
the name of Walter Carnahan,

14:27.434 --> 14:29.036
a satellite tech
at the Pentagon,

14:29.069 --> 14:30.470
when he stumbled upon
the Atlas Program

14:30.503 --> 14:32.239
and threatened to expose it.

14:32.272 --> 14:35.909
And he's not the only one
who's been targeted.

14:35.943 --> 14:37.945
An attempt was made
on Grace's life.

14:37.978 --> 14:41.114
A professional hit
that was traced back to a call

14:41.148 --> 14:43.316
made from the White House.

14:43.350 --> 14:46.386
What day is it?

14:47.420 --> 14:50.457
It's... Thursday, ma'am.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.333
If what you
say is true,

15:00.367 --> 15:04.504
I fear the enemy within

15:04.537 --> 15:06.906
is the most dangerous
of them all.

15:10.377 --> 15:11.678
(beeps)

15:17.484 --> 15:20.553
Good afternoon, Madam President.

15:35.502 --> 15:37.470
Thanks for coming.

15:37.504 --> 15:39.306
Not every day
the deputy secretary of defense

15:39.339 --> 15:40.707
asks for a clandestine meeting.

15:40.740 --> 15:43.343
What do you need?

15:43.376 --> 15:45.612
A list of everyone who was in
the White House on Monday night

15:45.645 --> 15:48.215
between 11:05 and 11:36 p.m.

15:48.248 --> 15:50.483
Eh, White House security logs
are classified. You know that.

15:50.517 --> 15:52.385
Executive branch only.
I wouldn't ask

15:52.419 --> 15:54.321
if it weren't a matter
of national security.

15:54.354 --> 15:55.622
And the president's safety.

15:55.655 --> 15:58.191
Something I should know?

15:59.692 --> 16:02.495
(exhales)
Not yet.

16:05.398 --> 16:06.699
Okay.

16:06.733 --> 16:08.701
But not because
you're deputy secretary.

16:08.735 --> 16:11.238
Because you were a damn
good roommate at the Academy.

16:11.271 --> 16:13.240
(grunts)

16:13.273 --> 16:15.142
That seems like
forever ago, man.

16:15.175 --> 16:16.476
(chuckles)

16:16.509 --> 16:18.345
'Cause it was.

16:18.378 --> 16:21.681
It's good to know there's
still someone I can trust.

16:23.116 --> 16:24.317
Thanks.

16:27.454 --> 16:29.189
(engine starts)

16:29.222 --> 16:31.658
SECRETARY:
So, yes, I just have
them here right now.

16:31.691 --> 16:34.561
Ms. Rayburn.

16:34.594 --> 16:36.596
(continues indistinctly)

16:40.467 --> 16:42.635
(door closes)

16:42.669 --> 16:45.538
I just got off the phone
with POTUS.

16:45.572 --> 16:47.674
We have a huge problem.

16:51.844 --> 16:54.447
Darius, either the president
didn't know about Atlas, or...

16:54.481 --> 16:56.649
She doesn't remember.

16:56.683 --> 16:58.385
I'm not sure which is worse.

16:58.418 --> 16:59.419
What now?

16:59.452 --> 17:01.521
THERESA:
Darius.

17:02.789 --> 17:04.391
Tess.

17:04.424 --> 17:05.425
Hello.

17:05.458 --> 17:06.726
Hi.

17:09.229 --> 17:10.530
Uh, you remember Grace Barrows.

17:10.563 --> 17:12.432
Yes, of course.
Nice to see you again.

17:12.465 --> 17:14.601
What are you doing here?

17:14.634 --> 17:15.835
The board called
an emergency meeting.

17:15.868 --> 17:18.138
I assumed you knew.

17:18.171 --> 17:19.839
Lazlo left his stock to me,

17:19.872 --> 17:22.542
so I figured I should
attend my first meeting.

17:22.575 --> 17:24.844
Yes, of course.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.513
Ten percent ownership.

17:26.546 --> 17:28.315
You were
very generous.

17:28.348 --> 17:29.716
He-he more than earned it.

17:31.418 --> 17:34.721
(phone vibrating)

17:34.754 --> 17:37.624
Grace, we'll regroup shortly.

17:37.657 --> 17:39.792
Okay.

17:39.826 --> 17:41.761
Millie, what's going on?

17:43.630 --> 17:45.632
I'll be right there.

17:45.665 --> 17:49.769
Pentagon Press Secretary Grace
Barrows and I traveled to Russia

17:49.802 --> 17:52.639
and learned firsthand
that Tanz's guidance system...

17:52.672 --> 17:54.274
I hate to crimp
your TV watching,

17:54.307 --> 17:56.543
but I've got a company to run.

17:56.576 --> 17:58.545
Now, which one
of you worrywarts

17:58.578 --> 18:00.313
pulled the fire alarm?

18:01.514 --> 18:02.549
NICHOLAS:
I did.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.417
It was me.

18:04.451 --> 18:06.386
Hello, Darius.

18:06.419 --> 18:08.688
And Theresa--
well, this is quite

18:08.721 --> 18:09.856
the reunion.

18:09.889 --> 18:12.225
Since when are you
on the board, Nicholas?

18:12.259 --> 18:13.626
Well, since I bought up
your former business partner

18:13.660 --> 18:15.628
Catherine Adams's shares
for double

18:15.662 --> 18:17.330
what they were worth.

18:17.364 --> 18:19.532
She's quite shrewd,
drove a hard bargain.

18:19.566 --> 18:22.235
But as we both know,

18:22.269 --> 18:24.404
everyone has their price.

18:25.538 --> 18:27.240
And I hope

18:27.274 --> 18:29.509
you brought your shoebox
full of receipts, Darius,

18:29.542 --> 18:32.679
because there is a
billion dollars missing

18:32.712 --> 18:34.281
from these balance sheets

18:34.314 --> 18:35.682
without explanation.

18:37.384 --> 18:39.686
Shall we begin?

18:42.255 --> 18:43.523
What did you say to her?

18:43.556 --> 18:45.758
The president.
Nothing that Darius and I

18:45.792 --> 18:47.660
didn't already say
to the both of you.

18:47.694 --> 18:50.430
So you approached
an unstable president

18:50.463 --> 18:53.466
with information that she
was ill-equipped to handle?

18:53.500 --> 18:55.468
What exactly is going on here?

18:55.502 --> 18:57.604
Grace, we just received word
that POTUS has scheduled

18:57.637 --> 18:59.706
a televised address
for this evening.

18:59.739 --> 19:03.210
She intends to publicly
apologize to Russia for Atlas,

19:03.243 --> 19:05.011
and tell the world
about the asteroid.

19:08.881 --> 19:12.485
Project Samson
is about to go public.

19:20.760 --> 19:21.928
Grace.

19:23.896 --> 19:26.233
Grace, where are you going?
We're in crisis here.

19:26.266 --> 19:27.467
I'm going to need you
to make a statement.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.436
Okay, here's my statement:
screw you.

19:29.469 --> 19:30.537
Screw the Pentagon.

19:30.570 --> 19:32.505
Okay, just talk to me.

19:32.539 --> 19:34.607
How dare that woman
blame me or Darius

19:34.641 --> 19:37.210
for what's happening.
Somebody tried to kill me.

19:37.244 --> 19:39.212
Although I guess nobody gives
a damn about Grace Barrows

19:39.246 --> 19:40.447
or Walter Carnahan or any
of the other little people

19:40.480 --> 19:42.349
that got taken out
along the way,

19:42.382 --> 19:44.217
so long as the lies
are protected.

19:44.251 --> 19:45.285
Don't say that. I do.

19:45.318 --> 19:47.587
I give a damn.
More than you know.

19:47.620 --> 19:50.523
We're facing down a crisis
of epic proportions here.

19:50.557 --> 19:53.393
We need our press secretary.

19:53.426 --> 19:55.328
Right around the time
when I was almost strangled

19:55.362 --> 19:57.364
and learned the government
might be responsible,

19:57.397 --> 19:58.898
that's about the same time
I started thinking,

19:58.931 --> 20:00.400
maybe I need a new job.

20:00.433 --> 20:02.569
Where are you going?

20:04.271 --> 20:05.472
To find my daughter.

20:05.505 --> 20:07.240
She's not gonna find out
from a television

20:07.274 --> 20:08.608
that the world might be ending.

20:08.641 --> 20:10.277
She's gonna hear it from me.

20:13.613 --> 20:15.548
NICHOLAS:
I couldn't help but notice

20:15.582 --> 20:18.485
a recent influx
of a billion dollars,

20:18.518 --> 20:21.288
which vanished as soon
as it had appeared.

20:21.321 --> 20:23.022
You have hired
hundreds of employees

20:23.055 --> 20:25.358
for a questionable
Mars project.

20:25.392 --> 20:27.894
You're-you're hemorrhaging
resources.

20:27.927 --> 20:29.429
And now you admit

20:29.462 --> 20:31.364
you were involved

20:31.398 --> 20:32.999
in an illegal weapons scheme?

20:33.032 --> 20:34.967
(sighing):
Here we go again.

20:35.001 --> 20:38.605
We weren't involved, they simply
used our technology.

20:38.638 --> 20:41.308
Oh, I see. And what is worse?

20:41.341 --> 20:44.577
That Tanz was involved
in this clandestine scheme,

20:44.611 --> 20:47.814
or that you didn't know
that it was involved in it?

20:47.847 --> 20:49.816
There are massively important
things at stake here.

20:49.849 --> 20:54.053
Things I can't yet make public.

20:54.086 --> 20:56.689
I am not the public.

20:56.723 --> 20:58.491
We are your board.

20:58.525 --> 21:00.327
We have the right to know
all you know.

21:00.360 --> 21:02.295
And you will, very soon.

21:02.329 --> 21:04.497
There's exciting
new technology in play

21:04.531 --> 21:07.400
that will change
all of our fortunes.

21:07.434 --> 21:09.436
In light of everything
that's happened,

21:09.469 --> 21:13.440
I think we're going to require
a little more specificity.

21:19.111 --> 21:20.547
I can't do that right now.

21:20.580 --> 21:22.449
Then you leave me no choice.

21:22.482 --> 21:24.317
I call on this board:

21:24.351 --> 21:27.387
remove the CEO
of Tanz Industries

21:27.420 --> 21:28.988
and to name...

21:30.089 --> 21:31.424
...an acting executive

21:31.458 --> 21:32.659
in his place.

21:36.095 --> 21:38.831
Here you go.
Thank you very much.

21:41.468 --> 21:42.702
You can seat
yourself, ma'am.

21:42.735 --> 21:44.070
Uh, no, I'm not
here to eat.

21:44.103 --> 21:45.572
I'm looking
for Zoe Barrows.

21:45.605 --> 21:46.573
Oh, you and me both.

21:46.606 --> 21:48.375
Excuse me?
Yeah, she quit.

21:48.408 --> 21:49.742
No warning. Nothing.
Just never showed.

21:49.776 --> 21:50.977
What? When?

21:51.010 --> 21:52.445
A few days ago.

21:52.479 --> 21:53.413
Kind of left me hanging.

21:53.446 --> 21:56.583
(phone line ringing)

21:56.616 --> 21:57.817
ZOE (recorded message):
Hey, it's Zoe.

21:57.850 --> 21:59.486
You know what to do.
(beep)

22:04.424 --> 22:05.825
(phone beeps)

22:08.495 --> 22:10.363
(phone line ringing)

22:10.397 --> 22:12.031
REPRESENTATIVE:
OnValet, this is Bruce.

22:12.064 --> 22:13.633
Yes, this is Grace Barrows.

22:13.666 --> 22:15.134
How can I help you today,
Ms. Barrows?

22:15.167 --> 22:18.505
Uh, I think my daughter's car
might have been stolen.

22:18.538 --> 22:20.407
It's registered
on the same account.

22:20.440 --> 22:22.442
You think you could
help me find it?

22:26.613 --> 22:29.649
Smart move,
calling for a recess.

22:29.682 --> 22:32.419
I was building up some
real momentum in there.

22:32.452 --> 22:34.387
So, revenge?
That's what this is?

22:34.421 --> 22:35.655
Nonsense.

22:35.688 --> 22:37.424
Revenge is for children.

22:37.457 --> 22:38.525
This is retribution.

22:38.558 --> 22:40.092
You broke into my home,

22:40.126 --> 22:41.694
and now I break
into yours.

22:41.728 --> 22:43.530
(chuckles)

22:43.563 --> 22:45.498
You have no idea
what you're meddling in here.

22:45.532 --> 22:47.166
You can't manage
this ship.

22:47.199 --> 22:48.735
It's too big for you.

22:48.768 --> 22:50.870
I built this
from the ground up.

22:50.903 --> 22:53.573
You bring someone else in here,
you're asking for the Titanic.

22:53.606 --> 22:57.444
You think you're the only one
that can pull strings?

22:57.477 --> 22:58.778
Manipulate?

22:58.811 --> 23:00.179
Get what you want?

23:00.212 --> 23:02.449
I don't play by
your rules, Uncle.

23:02.482 --> 23:03.650
I'm nothing like you.

23:03.683 --> 23:05.485
Ah.

23:05.518 --> 23:07.153
Well, I guess that

23:07.186 --> 23:09.121
kind of delusion is...

23:09.155 --> 23:11.624
is what has made you
so damn successful.

23:15.495 --> 23:17.196
(sighs)

23:17.229 --> 23:18.798
Darius.

23:20.132 --> 23:22.535
You know I had nothing
to do with this.

23:22.569 --> 23:24.504
Of course.

23:26.639 --> 23:27.840
Can we talk?

23:27.874 --> 23:29.108
Privately?

23:31.911 --> 23:35.482
Oh. Wow.
(chuckles)

23:35.515 --> 23:37.484
I call it
the Treehouse.

23:37.517 --> 23:39.486
It's where I do
my best thinking.

23:39.519 --> 23:40.887
You always did.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.489
(chuckles)

23:42.522 --> 23:44.657
That tree house,
we must have spent hours

23:44.691 --> 23:46.626
in that musty,
old place.

23:46.659 --> 23:48.528
Until I nearly burned it down
trying to launch

23:48.561 --> 23:49.729
one of my test rockets.

23:49.762 --> 23:52.064
(laughs): Yes.
With all of us inside it.

23:52.098 --> 23:54.166
Well, technically,
Lazlo was outside.

23:54.200 --> 23:55.835
Because he was
dangling from a branch,

23:55.868 --> 23:58.070
trying to escape.

23:58.104 --> 23:59.972
I thought your father
was going to kill you.

24:00.006 --> 24:01.508
He was. He definitely was.

24:01.541 --> 24:03.009
Until my mother
saved the day.

24:03.042 --> 24:04.744
That's right.

24:04.777 --> 24:07.614
Yes, she said she'd given you
permission to launch.

24:07.647 --> 24:09.982
Mom, she always protected me.

24:10.016 --> 24:11.918
Right until the end.

24:13.285 --> 24:15.822
I was sorry to hear
about her passing.

24:15.855 --> 24:19.759
At least she got to see
you achieve all of this.

24:19.792 --> 24:23.630
You know, see you
become "Darius Tanz."

24:25.665 --> 24:28.501
I'm gonna do whatever I can
to sway the board.

24:28.535 --> 24:32.004
But if I can't, is there
someone else you can put up

24:32.038 --> 24:33.806
as a successor?

24:33.840 --> 24:35.775
(scoffs)
Just to
protect yourself.

24:35.808 --> 24:38.611
I've always been
big on plan Bs, but...

24:38.645 --> 24:40.913
that one,
I haven't accounted for.
Hmm.

24:40.947 --> 24:42.582
In case of an
emergency landing,

24:42.615 --> 24:44.817
no flotation device.

24:46.018 --> 24:48.588
*

24:48.621 --> 24:50.022
Tess,

24:50.056 --> 24:52.992
there isn't a day
I don't have regrets

24:53.025 --> 24:55.127
over what happened between us.

24:57.830 --> 25:00.967
Well, you needed to
achieve all this.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.935
You would have been

25:02.969 --> 25:04.771
deeply unhappy
otherwise.

25:07.974 --> 25:10.209
What if I'm
unhappy anyway?

25:10.242 --> 25:11.878
(scoffs)

25:11.911 --> 25:13.245
That's ridiculous.

25:13.279 --> 25:15.047
You're the man
who has everything.

25:15.081 --> 25:17.617
Almost.

25:21.754 --> 25:23.590
What happened?

25:23.623 --> 25:26.225
We've been separated
for months.

25:26.258 --> 25:27.960
I was wearing
the ring

25:27.994 --> 25:31.530
mostly out of habit,
and for the kids.

25:34.266 --> 25:36.068
Hey, Darius.

25:36.102 --> 25:38.104
I've been looking...
Oh, I'm sorry.

25:38.137 --> 25:40.707
I didn't know
I was interrupting.
No, you're not.

25:40.740 --> 25:42.074
Liam,
this is Theresa.

25:42.108 --> 25:43.676
Theresa, Liam.

25:43.710 --> 25:45.878
Hi.
My protégé.

25:45.912 --> 25:46.946
Can I borrow you for a moment?

25:54.921 --> 25:58.124
So, it's going 30% faster
than our initial calculations,

25:58.157 --> 26:00.693
which is good, but every time
I try to adjust the trajectory

26:00.727 --> 26:01.994
so that it
meets our target,

26:02.028 --> 26:03.930
it doesn't respond
to commands.

26:03.963 --> 26:05.965
Tess, ping the gravity tractor,
please.

26:05.998 --> 26:08.835
TESS:
With what command?
No command. Just a simple ping.

26:08.868 --> 26:10.102
(beeping)
TESS:
Ping returned.

26:10.136 --> 26:10.937
LIAM:
So it hears us,

26:10.970 --> 26:13.906
we hear it,
it's just not obeying.

26:13.940 --> 26:16.275
Well, the question is:
is this a glitch...

26:17.877 --> 26:19.846
...or a hack?
No, it can't be a hack.

26:19.879 --> 26:21.648
We put in all those
security protocols.

26:21.681 --> 26:23.650
Can't be Russia. They don't
even know it's up there.
Then what?

26:23.683 --> 26:24.884
What the hell is going on?

26:27.019 --> 26:29.288
CALHOUN: As you're all aware,
the president is going to

26:29.321 --> 26:31.090
address the nation tonight.

26:31.123 --> 26:33.826
She is going to inform
the public, the world,

26:33.860 --> 26:34.961
about Project Samson.

26:34.994 --> 26:36.963
In preparation
for the aftermath,

26:36.996 --> 26:38.931
we have
National Guard troops

26:38.965 --> 26:41.067
standing by
throughout the country.

26:41.100 --> 26:42.969
(phone vibrates)
We don't know
what to expect.

26:43.002 --> 26:44.236
Riots,

26:44.270 --> 26:46.839
anarchy,
martial law.

26:46.873 --> 26:48.808
We need to prepare
for the worst.

26:52.712 --> 26:54.714
(indistinct chatter)

26:54.747 --> 26:56.148
PLAYER:
Go, go, go, go, go.

27:00.920 --> 27:02.421
AUTOMATED VOICE: You've arrived
at your destination.

27:02.454 --> 27:04.056
Your route guidance is complete.

27:05.091 --> 27:07.727
(dogs barking in distance)

27:18.404 --> 27:20.673
*

27:33.119 --> 27:34.887
Zoe?
You followed me?

27:34.921 --> 27:36.388
I didn't.
I came to see you at work.

27:36.422 --> 27:38.357
And you quit, apparently.
(scoffs)

27:38.390 --> 27:40.426
I need to talk to you,
Zoe, it's urgent.

27:40.459 --> 27:41.928
No, Mom,
I'm done talking to you.

27:41.961 --> 27:43.062
We never say anything.

27:43.095 --> 27:44.964
Please...
get out of the car, okay?

27:44.997 --> 27:46.032
I don't want to fight.

27:46.065 --> 27:47.299
No.

27:47.333 --> 27:48.801
I'm done with you, Mom.

27:48.835 --> 27:50.002
With your lies.

27:50.036 --> 27:52.071
Drive. Just drive, Dylan.

27:52.104 --> 27:53.706
(engine starts)

28:00.947 --> 28:02.949
(tires screeching)

28:08.320 --> 28:10.823
Visitor logs to the White House.

28:10.857 --> 28:12.825
These are classified.
How did you...?

28:12.859 --> 28:14.994
I have a friend,
let's leave it at that.

28:15.027 --> 28:17.163
Take a look at who clocked in
at 11:00 p.m., just minutes

28:17.196 --> 28:20.099
before the call was made
to the assassin's phone.

28:20.132 --> 28:22.201
Calhoun.

28:22.234 --> 28:23.502
If he's calling for hits
on American citizens,

28:23.535 --> 28:25.704
for all we know,
the president's next.

28:27.106 --> 28:30.176
Claire, we're in the middle
of a slow-moving coup here,

28:30.209 --> 28:31.377
and it's picking up speed.

28:31.410 --> 28:34.080
We've got to get
to the president now.

28:48.060 --> 28:50.396
Ms. Barrows, he's not in.

28:50.429 --> 28:52.298
I need to talk to him now.

28:52.331 --> 28:56.235
I'm afraid he's not
reachable at the moment.

28:56.268 --> 28:59.872
Madam President,
Deputy Secretary Edwards

28:59.906 --> 29:01.073
wouldn't make accusations
like this

29:01.107 --> 29:02.775
unless h-he...

29:02.809 --> 29:06.846
we felt
you were in real danger.

29:06.879 --> 29:08.080
I don't doubt
what you're both telling me.

29:08.114 --> 29:09.381
But it just confirms
my decision

29:09.415 --> 29:10.449
to make changes.

29:13.285 --> 29:14.821
What kinds of changes?

29:14.854 --> 29:17.156
Policy, personnel.

29:17.189 --> 29:18.257
Everything.

29:20.126 --> 29:22.094
I'm cleaning house.

29:22.128 --> 29:23.996
Madam President,
am I being fired?

29:24.030 --> 29:25.998
Fired?
(chuckles)

29:26.032 --> 29:27.433
Absolutely not.

29:27.466 --> 29:30.402
Randall Calhoun is being fired.

29:30.436 --> 29:32.104
And you?

29:32.138 --> 29:34.807
You're my new acting
secretary of defense.

29:37.343 --> 29:39.211
I serve at the pleasure
of the president.

29:39.245 --> 29:41.047
I don't need
your platitudes,

29:41.080 --> 29:43.115
Deputy Secretary,
I need your loyalty.

29:43.149 --> 29:46.318
My loyalty?

29:46.352 --> 29:48.287
I cannot have one person
in my administration

29:48.320 --> 29:50.456
who is not completely
trustworthy.

29:50.489 --> 29:53.325
I need absolute...

29:57.529 --> 29:59.298
...transparency.

29:59.331 --> 30:00.299
I understand.

30:00.332 --> 30:01.533
I'm not a politician.

30:01.567 --> 30:03.202
I can't promise you
loyalty.

30:03.235 --> 30:04.904
But honesty?

30:04.937 --> 30:06.873
That I can give you.

30:06.906 --> 30:09.075
Deal.

30:12.078 --> 30:13.279
And Madam President,

30:13.312 --> 30:15.147
if I'm being
completely honest,

30:15.181 --> 30:18.150
I think it's a terrible mistake
to address the nation tonight.

30:18.184 --> 30:19.385
Why is that?

30:19.418 --> 30:20.486
With the gravity tractor
on course

30:20.519 --> 30:22.321
to deflect
the asteroid,

30:22.354 --> 30:23.322
I'm not sure what we gain.

30:23.355 --> 30:24.891
Frankly, this speech
could trigger

30:24.924 --> 30:26.859
worldwide chaos.
If we're to

30:26.893 --> 30:28.260
regain our integrity
on the world stage,

30:28.294 --> 30:30.029
we've got to take
responsibility.

30:30.062 --> 30:32.531
Take responsib...

30:32.564 --> 30:34.934
(ears ringing)
Damn it.

30:34.967 --> 30:36.302
(moans)

30:36.335 --> 30:37.937
CLAIRE: Madam President,
do you need to lie down?

30:37.970 --> 30:40.106
No, no, no.

30:40.139 --> 30:42.008
(ringing fades)

30:42.041 --> 30:43.209
No.

30:46.678 --> 30:48.314
Secretary Edwards,

30:48.347 --> 30:50.216
the answer to you is no.

30:50.249 --> 30:51.918
This speech
cannot wait.

30:51.951 --> 30:54.553
No more secrets, no more lies.

30:54.586 --> 30:56.956
The only way to
achieve world peace

30:56.989 --> 30:59.391
is for us to make peace
with ourselves,

30:59.425 --> 31:03.029
and take responsibility
for what we've done.

31:05.297 --> 31:07.166
I've reviewed this
a thousand times.

31:07.199 --> 31:08.367
We can't adjust
the speed,

31:08.400 --> 31:10.002
we can't adjust
the orbit.

31:10.036 --> 31:12.204
Manual override
won't allow a reboot.

31:12.238 --> 31:13.605
It's not accepting
our commands.

31:13.639 --> 31:15.607
But no one else knows
that it's up there.

31:17.009 --> 31:18.177
Unless...

31:18.210 --> 31:19.345
Unless what?

31:19.378 --> 31:21.180
Tess, at current course
and speed,

31:21.213 --> 31:23.582
where will the gravity tractor
meet up with the target orbit?

31:23.615 --> 31:25.184
TESS:
At present course and speed,

31:25.217 --> 31:27.186
the gravity tractor will collide
with the target

31:27.219 --> 31:28.220
in three weeks, four days.

31:28.254 --> 31:29.155
Collide?

31:29.188 --> 31:31.123
It's not gonna move
the asteroid off course,

31:31.157 --> 31:32.358
it's gonna impact it.

31:32.391 --> 31:33.425
Why? Why would anyone do that?

31:33.459 --> 31:35.194
Tess, if the gravity tractor
collides with Samson

31:35.227 --> 31:36.428
at its current trajectory,

31:36.462 --> 31:39.031
where will the fragments
land on Earth?

31:39.065 --> 31:41.367
Calculating.

31:41.400 --> 31:46.072
The Eastern Hemisphere,
north of the equator.

31:46.105 --> 31:47.706
We haven't been hacked;
we've been conned.

31:47.739 --> 31:48.774
We made the EmDrive,

31:48.807 --> 31:50.609
but the government supplied
the gravity tractor.

31:50.642 --> 31:52.311
This was their plan all along.

31:52.344 --> 31:54.346
So, they've
adjusted their speed

31:54.380 --> 31:56.382
and their course just enough
to save us.

31:56.415 --> 31:57.649
And destroy our enemies.
Well, what do we do?

31:57.683 --> 31:59.051
How do we stop it?

31:59.085 --> 32:02.421
I'm not sure yet.

32:02.454 --> 32:03.622
(door opens)

32:03.655 --> 32:06.025
Darius, the board
has reconvened.

32:06.058 --> 32:07.159
They're ready for you.

32:09.161 --> 32:10.629
Karissa, find me Grace Barrows,
wherever the hell she is.

32:10.662 --> 32:11.964
Do it now.

32:26.178 --> 32:28.414
All right. I'm here.

32:28.447 --> 32:29.548
Out with it.

32:29.581 --> 32:31.083
We haven't voted yet.

32:31.117 --> 32:32.484
We thought you deserved

32:32.518 --> 32:34.353
the opportunity to see

32:34.386 --> 32:36.188
who supports you
and who doesn't.

32:36.222 --> 32:38.657
Of course. Seems only fair since
it's my name on the building.

32:38.690 --> 32:40.359
Our name.

32:41.493 --> 32:42.728
Shall we vote?

32:42.761 --> 32:43.996
THERESA:
Before we do,

32:44.030 --> 32:45.764
I would like
to say something.

32:45.797 --> 32:47.666
Time for comment is over.

32:47.699 --> 32:49.435
This may be
my first board meeting,

32:49.468 --> 32:52.271
but I'm fairly certain
it's customary to hear

32:52.304 --> 32:54.573
both sides of an argument
before taking a vote.

32:54.606 --> 32:56.175
TANZ:
Careful, Nicholas.

32:56.208 --> 32:57.376
You wouldn't want
your little coup

32:57.409 --> 32:58.977
invalidated on
a technicality.

33:04.716 --> 33:09.388
I have known Darius
for most of my life.

33:09.421 --> 33:11.723
I knew him
when all of this

33:11.757 --> 33:15.561
was just a dream and yet,
here we all sit.

33:15.594 --> 33:19.398
His dreams have made you rich.

33:19.431 --> 33:21.667
And more importantly,
they've...

33:21.700 --> 33:24.336
they've made the world
a better place.

33:26.338 --> 33:31.077
So, I, for one, am not willing
to throw him overboard

33:31.110 --> 33:33.145
just because the water's
a little rough.

33:33.179 --> 33:35.347
That is the time to
support your captain...

33:36.548 --> 33:38.417
...not abandon him.

33:40.786 --> 33:43.355
It is so touching...

33:44.423 --> 33:46.058
...for you to stand up

33:46.092 --> 33:47.526
for your childhood sweetheart.

33:47.559 --> 33:48.794
But this is

33:48.827 --> 33:50.696
not about emotions.

33:50.729 --> 33:53.232
It's about business.

33:53.265 --> 33:55.101
And as a businessman,

33:55.134 --> 33:57.136
Darius is failing.

33:57.169 --> 33:58.370
Let's vote.

33:58.404 --> 34:00.306
All those in favor

34:00.339 --> 34:02.474
of removing Darius as CEO,

34:02.508 --> 34:04.610
raise their hands.

34:08.680 --> 34:10.182
Where is he?

34:10.216 --> 34:11.283
He's in a board meeting.

34:11.317 --> 34:12.851
They're trying to
depose him as CEO.

34:12.884 --> 34:14.853
And the gravity tractor
is malfunctioning.

34:14.886 --> 34:16.788
I think Harris and Claire
did a bait and switch.

34:16.822 --> 34:19.325
And I can't figure
out how to stop it.

34:19.358 --> 34:21.293
(groans) Why can't we have
one good day? Just one.

34:21.327 --> 34:22.428
Liam, the president's
gonna tell the world

34:22.461 --> 34:24.430
about the asteroid
in a televised speech

34:24.463 --> 34:25.331
in one hour.

34:25.364 --> 34:26.632
Wow.

34:26.665 --> 34:27.833
Yeah.

34:27.866 --> 34:29.368
Fasten your seatbelt.

34:29.401 --> 34:31.303
We're going over a cliff.

34:33.239 --> 34:35.307
(door closes)

34:35.341 --> 34:37.876
Achievements:
uh, a positive attitude.

34:37.909 --> 34:39.211
(laughs):
Yeah.

34:39.245 --> 34:40.512
Hey, Jillian.

34:41.880 --> 34:42.881
Do you have a minute?

34:42.914 --> 34:45.817
Uh, we're just on a short break.

34:45.851 --> 34:47.619
Maybe later?
Now would be better.

34:47.653 --> 34:49.855
We're pretty busy here,
kiddo. Maybe later.

34:49.888 --> 34:51.457
Okay.

34:51.490 --> 34:53.325
Yeah, no problem.
Prick.

34:53.359 --> 34:55.261
What'd you just say?
LIAM: You have
a nickname for me.

34:55.294 --> 34:57.429
I have a nickname for you.
It's prick.

34:58.397 --> 35:01.300
Whoa. Stop! Enough.
WOMAN: Guys...

35:01.333 --> 35:03.169
You know what,
you're right.

35:05.337 --> 35:06.772
Enough.

35:11.510 --> 35:14.112
(groans)

35:21.353 --> 35:23.255
(doors opening)

35:26.592 --> 35:28.460
You sick son of a bitch.

35:28.494 --> 35:30.262
Said the traitor
who got me fired.

35:30.296 --> 35:32.198
You were at the White House
when the hit went out on her.

35:32.231 --> 35:33.031
You killed Carnahan

35:33.064 --> 35:34.866
and you tried to
kill Grace Barrows.

35:34.900 --> 35:36.568
You're running rogue and
now you're running scared.

35:36.602 --> 35:37.869
JIM:
Randall.

35:37.903 --> 35:38.904
Everything all right?

35:38.937 --> 35:40.206
Everything's fine.

35:40.239 --> 35:41.840
Get the rest of your stuff.

35:43.209 --> 35:44.410
If I did all that,

35:44.443 --> 35:45.777
then who am I running from?

35:45.811 --> 35:47.213
Why don't you tell me

35:47.246 --> 35:48.447
or I'll have you
arrested this time,

35:48.480 --> 35:50.482
see how you like
being waterboarded.

35:50.516 --> 35:52.384
I didn't go after Grace.
Then who the hell did?

35:52.418 --> 35:53.885
Harris, open your eyes.
You've been played.

35:53.919 --> 35:56.255
You really think I could be
in charge of all this?

35:56.288 --> 35:59.225
That I could mastermind all this
without help on the inside?

35:59.258 --> 36:01.760
What are you saying?

36:03.795 --> 36:06.698
I'm saying I have a husband
I love very much

36:06.732 --> 36:08.667
and I'm gonna protect him
from all this madness,

36:08.700 --> 36:10.469
get in my car and drive.

36:10.502 --> 36:13.205
Now, you can shoot me or you can
let me go, but either way,

36:13.239 --> 36:15.907
you got the wrong guy.

36:15.941 --> 36:18.244
Now, they're
probably watching,

36:18.277 --> 36:20.312
so step carefully.

36:20.346 --> 36:23.582
There are land mines
everywhere.

36:23.615 --> 36:25.217
HARRIS:
Randall, you can't just

36:25.251 --> 36:26.485
walk out of here like this.

36:28.454 --> 36:29.755
Watch me.

36:29.788 --> 36:31.590
Jim, this is Harris Edwards,

36:31.623 --> 36:33.325
the new secretary
of defense.

36:33.359 --> 36:34.860
Wish him luck.

36:34.893 --> 36:37.195
He's gonna need it.
(keys jingle)

36:38.797 --> 36:41.233
(doors open, engine starts)

36:59.885 --> 37:02.020
Darius.

37:02.053 --> 37:03.489
Darius?

37:04.656 --> 37:07.259
Look, I-I know the
timing is terrible,

37:07.293 --> 37:08.594
but you need to know.

37:08.627 --> 37:09.995
The president's
addressing the nation

37:10.028 --> 37:12.331
in 20 minutes to
reveal everything

37:12.364 --> 37:13.198
about Samson.

37:13.231 --> 37:14.500
Who knows how the
world's gonna react.

37:14.533 --> 37:16.935
Excuse me.

37:18.670 --> 37:21.373
(screams):
No!

37:23.709 --> 37:25.043
Hey.

37:25.076 --> 37:26.712
Darius, what happened in there?

37:27.746 --> 37:29.581
I lost, Grace.

37:29.615 --> 37:31.049
Tanz, my life's work,

37:31.082 --> 37:32.851
everything.
THERESA:
Darius.

37:34.386 --> 37:35.821
Excuse me.

37:35.854 --> 37:37.289
I-I need a moment.

37:38.657 --> 37:41.360
I am so sorry.
I'll do whatever I can

37:41.393 --> 37:43.895
to help smooth the transition.
Don't worry about me.

37:43.929 --> 37:45.664
Tess, I'm afraid
that after tonight,

37:45.697 --> 37:48.367
the world as we know it
will be very different.

37:48.400 --> 37:50.268
What do you mean?

38:02.981 --> 38:03.849
(kisses)

38:05.351 --> 38:07.386
Go home to your children.

38:22.634 --> 38:23.635
(sighs)

38:28.139 --> 38:30.041
Cheers.

38:30.075 --> 38:31.643
NEWSMAN: We'll be carrying
the president's speech live

38:31.677 --> 38:32.611
in just moments.

38:32.644 --> 38:34.112
The White House is keeping

38:34.145 --> 38:37.048
strangely silent on the topic
of this address.

38:39.050 --> 38:40.986
Not too much powder.

38:42.988 --> 38:44.823
I'm good. I'm-I'm good.

38:47.459 --> 38:48.660
(coughs)

38:48.694 --> 38:49.695
Madam President.

38:49.728 --> 38:50.962
Yes?

38:50.996 --> 38:52.398
Are you all right?

38:52.431 --> 38:54.733
Yes.

38:54.766 --> 38:56.067
Of course.

38:56.101 --> 38:57.903
Let's get on with it, shall we?

39:01.840 --> 39:03.141
NEWSMAN 2:
Ladies and gentlemen,

39:03.174 --> 39:04.743
the president
of the United States.

39:04.776 --> 39:06.578
MACKENZIE:
My fellow Americans,

39:06.612 --> 39:11.717
tonight is an historic evening
for many reasons.

39:11.750 --> 39:16.622
What I'm about to say to you all
will cause some concern.

39:16.655 --> 39:20.826
We stand at a pivotal moment
in history

39:20.859 --> 39:22.628
when our country-- indeed,

39:22.661 --> 39:27.799
our world-- faces
challenges on many fronts.

39:27.833 --> 39:29.801
Claire, we need to talk.

39:29.835 --> 39:33.805
But I can assure you that...

39:35.807 --> 39:38.176
that...

39:38.209 --> 39:41.112
(stammers)

39:41.146 --> 39:43.615
that...

39:45.717 --> 39:48.119
uh...

39:48.153 --> 39:50.722
(groans)
Get the medic.

39:50.756 --> 39:52.123
Get the medic!
Turn those cameras off now!

39:57.829 --> 39:59.631
Madam President.

39:59.665 --> 40:01.132
Get the medic!

40:09.140 --> 40:10.476
Hey.

40:10.509 --> 40:12.744
Where's Mason?

40:12.778 --> 40:15.781
At home like most people,

40:15.814 --> 40:19.017
watching the president's speech.

40:25.557 --> 40:26.958
(sighs, sniffs)

40:26.992 --> 40:28.827
Are you drunk?

40:30.629 --> 40:32.130
I cannot tell a lie.

40:32.163 --> 40:33.999
Well, apparently, I can,

40:34.032 --> 40:35.867
but not right now.
I didn't read the news.

40:35.901 --> 40:36.868
What happened?

40:36.902 --> 40:39.738
Everything bad.

40:39.771 --> 40:42.908
Today was a horrible,
no-good, very bad day.

40:42.941 --> 40:45.076
(sighs)

40:48.880 --> 40:51.216
(sighs)

40:53.785 --> 40:55.921
I think we should
get you to bed.

40:55.954 --> 40:57.789
Mm.

40:57.823 --> 40:59.791
You gonna tuck me in?

40:59.825 --> 41:01.860
Or read me a story? You
want to stay the night?

41:01.893 --> 41:03.194
I didn't say that.

41:08.166 --> 41:11.102
Jillian, you are the only
woman I will ever love.

41:11.136 --> 41:13.238
And t-that's not because
the world's gonna become

41:13.271 --> 41:15.874
a pile of ash and there is
no time to meet anyone else.

41:17.142 --> 41:19.511
I really mean it.

41:19.545 --> 41:22.981
We'll talk in the morning...

41:23.014 --> 41:25.083
when you're sober.

41:25.116 --> 41:27.085
Okay.

41:27.118 --> 41:29.287
Okay, but you need, you
need to be right here.

41:29.320 --> 41:32.658
The work you're doing is the
only thing that matters now.

41:36.895 --> 41:38.530
(sighs)

41:42.300 --> 41:44.603
(door closes)

41:51.877 --> 41:53.845
Sudden death.

41:53.879 --> 41:55.046
...that I will faithfully
execute the office...

41:55.080 --> 41:56.848
That's one way to avoid

41:56.882 --> 41:59.284
an impeachment hearing
over your Atlas exposé.

41:59.317 --> 42:00.819
Guess it shuts the door

42:00.852 --> 42:01.987
on your story.

42:02.020 --> 42:05.023
This isn't the end
of the story.

42:05.056 --> 42:08.026
This is just the beginning.

42:08.059 --> 42:10.796
...will to the best of
my ability, preserve, protect

42:10.829 --> 42:13.231
and defend the Constitution
of the United States.

42:13.264 --> 42:16.968
And will, to the best
of my ability, preserve,

42:17.002 --> 42:18.236
protect and defend

42:18.269 --> 42:20.071
the Constitution
of the United States.

42:20.105 --> 42:22.007
CHIEF JUSTICE:
So help me God.

42:22.040 --> 42:24.275
So help me God.

42:26.778 --> 42:28.780
So help us God.
