WEBVTT

00:05.924 --> 00:07.196
JESSIE:

00:07.197 --> 00:08.467
Whoo! Go, Luke!

00:08.593 --> 00:09.823
Careful! If you break

00:09.824 --> 00:11.053
your neck, your parents

00:08.593 --> 00:11.053
will break mine!

00:13.639 --> 00:15.246
Doesn't Luke

00:15.247 --> 00:16.851
have the most

00:13.639 --> 00:16.851
amazing moves?

00:16.976 --> 00:18.311
Yeah, you should

00:18.312 --> 00:19.645
see him wiggle out

00:16.976 --> 00:19.645
of doing chores.

00:22.523 --> 00:24.901
Why two cameras?

00:25.025 --> 00:26.666
- I can't decide
- which is his best side.

00:26.736 --> 00:27.862
Plus, if I blink

00:27.863 --> 00:28.988
and miss something,

00:29.113 --> 00:31.783
I have two back-ups.

00:31.908 --> 00:34.429
- Good thinking. - Here I am, blinking
- And missing everything.

00:36.203 --> 00:36.579
Are you a friend of his?

00:36.704 --> 00:38.581
I wish!

00:38.706 --> 00:40.541
- We're in the same
- math class.

00:40.666 --> 00:42.835
Hmm. Considering his grades,

00:42.836 --> 00:45.004
I'm stunned Luke even

00:40.666 --> 00:45.004
goes to math class.

00:45.129 --> 00:46.548
Oh, he does!

00:46.549 --> 00:47.966
I've got the video

00:45.129 --> 00:47.966
to prove it. See?

00:48.090 --> 00:50.593
I've got him texting,

00:50.594 --> 00:53.095
throwing spitballs,

00:48.090 --> 00:53.095
going sleepy-bye.

00:55.807 --> 00:57.684
I didn't know Luke could

00:57.685 --> 00:59.560
go sleepy-bye without

00:55.807 --> 00:59.560
Kenny the Koala.

00:59.685 --> 01:02.293
Uh, which is certainly

01:02.294 --> 01:04.899
not a stuffed bear

00:59.685 --> 01:04.899
he still sleeps with,

01:05.024 --> 01:06.130
because that would be

01:06.131 --> 01:07.234
an inappropriate thing

01:05.024 --> 01:07.234
to reveal.

01:09.612 --> 01:11.114
The point is Luke

01:11.115 --> 01:12.615
should be paying attention

01:09.612 --> 01:12.615
in math class.

01:12.740 --> 01:13.846
Well, I am

01:13.847 --> 01:14.951
an A+ student.

01:15.075 --> 01:17.095
- I could help Luke - get his grades up.
- And do his chores.

01:17.119 --> 01:18.829
Could you come

01:18.830 --> 01:20.539
over tomorrow

01:17.119 --> 01:20.539
to help Luke study?

01:20.665 --> 01:22.345
- Oh, hmm. Let me check
- my schedule. Yes!

01:23.918 --> 01:25.315
Hey, Luke, I got you

01:25.316 --> 01:26.712

01:28.047 --> 01:29.173

app I downloaded.

02:33.278 --> 02:36.574
It is called

02:36.575 --> 02:39.869
the Mystical iBall.

02:33.278 --> 02:39.869
It can see the future!

02:39.994 --> 02:41.954
Oh, I can do that, too.

02:42.080 --> 02:43.081
Am I done talking

02:43.082 --> 02:44.082
to Ravi about his

02:42.080 --> 02:44.082
stupid iBall app?

02:44.206 --> 02:47.251
Yes. Ooh, spooky!

02:50.212 --> 02:52.133
- Please do not belittle
- my digital soothsayer.

Hey, Ravi,

02:56.533 --> 02:58.137

02:58.262 --> 03:00.806
(NEIGHING)

03:00.932 --> 03:02.308
Mystical iBall,

03:02.309 --> 03:03.684
should I play Pony

03:00.932 --> 03:03.684
Princesses with Zuri?

03:06.020 --> 03:08.106
(WOMAN'S VOICE READING)

03:09.982 --> 03:11.047
I am afraid I cannot

03:11.048 --> 03:12.110
commit at this time.

03:13.778 --> 03:15.696
- I just need another
- princess in Ponylandia!

03:15.821 --> 03:17.323
I'm not asking you

03:17.324 --> 03:18.824
to cosign a loan!

03:22.954 --> 03:24.623
Mystical iBall,

03:24.624 --> 03:26.290
should we consume

03:22.954 --> 03:26.290
this cereal?

03:28.000 --> 03:30.044
WOMAN: Signs point to no.

03:32.171 --> 03:37.468
Ew! Chunky milk!

03:37.593 --> 03:40.721
The Mystical iBall was right!

03:40.722 --> 03:43.849
That proves it can

03:37.593 --> 03:43.849
see the future!

03:43.975 --> 03:45.956
No, it just proves Bertram

03:45.957 --> 03:47.937
is too lazy to go to

03:43.975 --> 03:47.937
the store and buy milk.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.025
I would, but

03:52.026 --> 03:53.317
it's so far away.

03:55.903 --> 03:57.655
The grocery store delivers!

03:57.780 --> 03:59.157
- I meant from here
- to the door.

04:02.994 --> 04:04.203
Luke, doesn't

04:04.204 --> 04:05.412

04:02.994 --> 04:05.412
belong on your bed?

04:05.537 --> 04:06.977
(SCOFFS) No!

04:06.978 --> 04:08.415
What am I,

04:05.537 --> 04:08.415
five years old?

04:08.540 --> 04:10.334
- I don't need that
- stupid bear anymore.

04:10.459 --> 04:12.187
- Well, then, maybe it's time
- for him to hibernate.

04:12.211 --> 04:14.546
Stop! (GASPS)

04:16.923 --> 04:18.009
Where's his little hat?

04:22.805 --> 04:24.473
There you go, mate.

04:26.600 --> 04:30.771
No worries.

04:30.896 --> 04:32.481
You might not want

04:32.482 --> 04:34.066
to let Connie see that.

04:34.192 --> 04:36.111
I can't believe you invited

04:36.112 --> 04:38.029
Creepy Connie Thompson

04:34.192 --> 04:38.029
here to study with me.

04:38.154 --> 04:39.435
- She's always
- checking me out.

04:40.698 --> 04:41.699
So? You're always

04:41.700 --> 04:42.700
checking me out.

04:44.952 --> 04:47.059
Well, yeah, but when I do it,

04:47.060 --> 04:49.165
it's cute and endearing.

04:49.289 --> 04:50.416
Besides, hanging out

04:50.417 --> 04:51.542
with Connie will drop

04:49.289 --> 04:51.542
my coolness factor

04:51.667 --> 04:53.502
by at least 80%.

04:53.627 --> 04:54.795
That's, like, half!

04:56.296 --> 04:57.527
See? This is why

04:57.528 --> 04:58.757
you need help

04:56.296 --> 04:58.757
with math.

04:58.883 --> 05:00.926
- Now, Connie is gonna
- be here in about two hours.

05:01.052 --> 05:02.052
(ELEVATOR CHIMES)

05:03.428 --> 05:04.763
Make that two seconds.

05:07.016 --> 05:09.247
Hi, Luke! Sorry I'm early,

05:09.248 --> 05:11.478
but I just couldn't wait

05:07.016 --> 05:11.478
to see you!

05:13.689 --> 05:14.815
Get better at math.

05:17.609 --> 05:19.778
Mystical iBall, is it

05:19.779 --> 05:21.947
safe to take Mr. Kipling

05:17.609 --> 05:21.947
for a walk?

05:22.073 --> 05:24.242
The answer is no.

05:25.743 --> 05:27.370
Don't listen

05:27.371 --> 05:28.996
to that stupid thing.

05:29.121 --> 05:30.331
You dare mock

05:30.332 --> 05:31.540
the Mystical iBall?

05:32.166 --> 05:34.231
I double dog dare!

05:34.232 --> 05:36.295
Give me that.

05:37.880 --> 05:39.191
- I don't think
- you know anything.

05:39.215 --> 05:41.363
That's right,

05:41.364 --> 05:43.510
I'm calling you out, iBall!

05:44.178 --> 05:45.179
You gonna do

05:45.180 --> 05:46.180
something about it?

05:47.932 --> 05:50.475
It is certain.

05:50.601 --> 05:52.666
Oh, I do not wish

05:52.667 --> 05:54.730
to be caught in the middle

05:50.601 --> 05:54.730
of your mystical smackdown.

05:58.067 --> 06:00.027
See? Nothing happened.

06:00.861 --> 06:01.987
(STUFFED TOY WHINNYING)

06:02.113 --> 06:03.447
(FABRIC TEARING)

06:03.572 --> 06:05.741
No!

06:05.866 --> 06:08.619
Let go!

06:08.744 --> 06:09.829
That is what happens

06:09.830 --> 06:10.913
when you poke the iBall.

06:12.081 --> 06:13.081
Why!

06:17.502 --> 06:18.734
Do not worry, Zuri,

06:18.735 --> 06:19.964
you can get the rest

06:17.502 --> 06:19.964
of your pony

06:20.089 --> 06:21.673
- when it comes out
- the other end.

06:25.177 --> 06:26.196
- Okay, Luke.
- Here's one.

06:26.220 --> 06:28.806
Three X

06:31.516 --> 06:32.851
plus six

06:35.729 --> 06:37.169
equals 15.

06:37.170 --> 06:38.607
Solve for X.

06:38.732 --> 06:42.111
Whoa!

06:42.236 --> 06:43.737
- Are you sure that's
- not a typo?

06:43.862 --> 06:45.343
- Letters don't even
- belong in math.

06:45.697 --> 06:47.699
Come on, Luke,

06:47.700 --> 06:49.701
you can do this.

06:49.827 --> 06:51.829
Think of it like

06:51.830 --> 06:53.831
a dance routine.

06:53.956 --> 06:55.416
Let's say you have a total

06:55.417 --> 06:56.875
of 15 moves in your routine,

06:53.956 --> 06:56.875
and you do six solo moves.

06:57.001 --> 06:58.273
How many moves

06:58.274 --> 06:59.544
do you have left?

06:59.670 --> 07:01.672
Nine, not counting

07:01.673 --> 07:03.674
the encore my fans

06:59.670 --> 07:03.674
always demand.

07:05.634 --> 07:07.219
You did math! (GASPS)

07:12.891 --> 07:14.018
I knew you had it in you,

07:14.019 --> 07:15.144
you beautiful mind, you!

07:16.103 --> 07:17.855
(CLEARS THROAT)

07:17.856 --> 07:19.606
We are trying to study.

07:19.731 --> 07:22.297
Oh, sorry. I'll let you two

07:22.298 --> 07:24.862
little mathletes keep up

07:19.731 --> 07:24.862
the good work.

07:24.987 --> 07:27.344
I'm just gonna subtract

07:27.345 --> 07:29.700
myself from the equation.

07:35.873 --> 07:37.833
- So, Luke, I've got
- another problem for you.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.419
There's a Harry Potter

07:39.420 --> 07:40.878
Costume Dance this Saturday

07:41.003 --> 07:42.505
and one girl

07:42.506 --> 07:44.006
still needs a date.

07:46.550 --> 07:48.390
- Um, I don't see that.
- What page are you on?

07:49.803 --> 07:51.701
I'm not talking about math.

07:51.702 --> 07:53.598
I'm talking about chemistry.

07:56.852 --> 07:58.520
I don't take chemistry.

08:00.939 --> 08:02.629
Uh, Connie,

08:02.630 --> 08:04.318
do you mind if I borrow

08:00.939 --> 08:04.318
Luke for a minute?

08:04.443 --> 08:05.444
Sure!

08:06.153 --> 08:07.029
(FEIGNING LAUGHTER)

08:07.154 --> 08:08.947
(GROWLS)

08:10.157 --> 08:11.554
Can't you see Connie

08:11.555 --> 08:12.951
wants you to ask her

08:10.157 --> 08:12.951
to that dance?

08:13.077 --> 08:15.162
What? Ew.

08:16.914 --> 08:18.416
It's just one night.

08:18.540 --> 08:19.563
I am not going

08:19.564 --> 08:20.584
to some stupid school

08:18.540 --> 08:20.584
dress-up dance

08:20.709 --> 08:22.461
with Creepy Connie.

08:22.586 --> 08:24.213
She's not creepy.

08:24.214 --> 08:25.839
Plus, you should focus

08:22.586 --> 08:25.839
on girls your own age.

08:25.964 --> 08:27.608
- If you keep hitting - on me, I'm
gonna start - Pulling my hair out.

08:27.632 --> 08:28.822
Yikes.

08:28.823 --> 08:30.010
Bald is a deal-breaker.

08:32.011 --> 08:33.472
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

08:34.472 --> 08:36.808
Hi, Connie.

08:39.227 --> 08:41.543
Would you like to go

08:41.544 --> 08:43.857
to that incredibly

08:39.227 --> 08:43.857
lame Harry...

08:43.982 --> 08:45.650
(SQUEALING) Yes!

08:45.776 --> 08:47.403
Oh, this is so awesome!

08:47.404 --> 08:49.029
I already have our

08:45.776 --> 08:49.029
costumes picked out!

08:49.154 --> 08:50.510
I can't wait for everyone

08:50.511 --> 08:51.865
to see how cute

08:49.154 --> 08:51.865
we look together!

08:51.990 --> 08:53.617
- I've gotta go
- whittle you a wand.

08:56.495 --> 08:58.039
I wonder which knife

08:58.040 --> 08:59.581
I should use.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.461
(CACKLING)

09:07.798 --> 09:09.078
- She's whittling
- me something.

09:09.967 --> 09:11.072
And she has

09:11.073 --> 09:12.177
a knife collection.

09:14.430 --> 09:16.070

19:48.231 --> 19:50.690
I'll still be here

19:45.769 --> 19:50.690
stuck with you two.

19:50.815 --> 19:52.817
Whoa, that's

19:52.818 --> 19:54.819
a lose-lose situation.

19:54.945 --> 19:56.926
Suddenly, I don't

19:56.927 --> 19:58.907
feel bad about looking

19:54.945 --> 19:58.907
for a new butler at 6:23.

20:03.870 --> 20:04.870
(ALL GASP)

20:08.625 --> 20:10.127
I can't believe you two

20:10.128 --> 20:11.628
got me all worked up

20:08.625 --> 20:11.628
over nothing!

20:11.753 --> 20:12.753
(ELEVATOR CHIMES)

20:12.796 --> 20:13.796
(GASPS)

20:14.798 --> 20:15.798
(BERTRAM SCREAMS)

20:17.634 --> 20:22.013
Bertram. You have company.

20:22.139 --> 20:24.599
Oh, thanks a lot.

20:24.724 --> 20:26.434
I got your back, Bertram.

20:26.559 --> 20:27.102
- You want a piece
- of this butler?

20:27.226 --> 20:29.395
Bring it!

20:29.520 --> 20:30.772
(FIGURE SCREAMING)

20:30.897 --> 20:31.897
Bertram! I'm out.

20:31.940 --> 20:33.046
Holler at me from

20:33.047 --> 20:34.151
the other side.

20:36.694 --> 20:38.634
Oh, please, please,

20:38.635 --> 20:40.573
please don't take me.

20:40.698 --> 20:42.096
Take the children!

20:42.097 --> 20:43.493
They're hiding

20:40.698 --> 20:43.493
behind the couch!

20:43.618 --> 20:44.702
(SCREAMS) It's hideous!

20:46.204 --> 20:48.081
It's just a kid.

20:48.206 --> 20:49.749
I know! Ahhh!

20:52.585 --> 20:54.253
(BOTH EXCLAIM)

20:54.378 --> 20:55.735
Connie's dressed

20:55.736 --> 20:57.090
like the grim reaper.

20:54.378 --> 20:57.090
That is not a good sign.

20:58.675 --> 21:00.010
No, I'm a Dementor!

21:01.011 --> 21:02.470
More like demented.

21:03.721 --> 21:05.787
So, Luke, are you ready

21:05.788 --> 21:07.851
to go to the dance?

21:08.643 --> 21:09.686
Kenny and I are.

21:11.855 --> 21:12.856
Aren't we, Kenny?

21:16.567 --> 21:19.863
That is just wrong!

21:19.988 --> 21:21.407
Listen, Creepy...

21:21.408 --> 21:22.824
I mean, Connie.

21:22.949 --> 21:24.034
Luke is not

21:24.035 --> 21:25.118
the guy for you.

21:22.949 --> 21:25.118
Trust me.

21:25.243 --> 21:26.578
Yes, he is!

21:26.579 --> 21:27.912
Luke is perfect!

21:28.830 --> 21:29.830
(ALL LAUGHING)

21:31.916 --> 21:32.792
Hey!

21:32.917 --> 21:34.252
- Do you really
- want to go out

21:34.377 --> 21:36.497
- With a guy who still sleeps
- with a stuffed animal?

21:36.546 --> 21:37.964
And a night light.

21:38.089 --> 21:39.423
It's a reading light!

21:40.633 --> 21:41.968
- Yeah, shaped
- like a choo-choo.

21:42.093 --> 21:44.888
(LAUGHS)

21:45.013 --> 21:46.243
He also has the personal

21:46.244 --> 21:47.473
hygiene of a wolverine.

21:48.808 --> 21:50.168
- That's an insult
- to wolverines.

21:50.227 --> 21:52.500
At least they occasionally

21:52.501 --> 21:54.772
lick themselves clean.

21:54.898 --> 21:57.609
Who cares?

21:57.610 --> 22:00.319
When you really love someone,

21:54.898 --> 22:00.319
you can overlook anything.

22:00.444 --> 22:02.947
Oh. Then I guess

22:02.948 --> 22:05.449
you don't care that Luke

22:00.444 --> 22:05.449
hasn't read one single word

22:05.575 --> 22:06.722
of any of the

22:06.723 --> 22:07.869
Harry Potter books.

22:07.994 --> 22:09.495
(GASPS)

22:09.620 --> 22:11.164
- I haven't even
- seen the movies.

22:14.709 --> 22:15.773
So this is what it feels

22:15.774 --> 22:16.836
like when love dies.

22:29.891 --> 22:31.309
Kenny?

22:31.434 --> 22:33.061
- Get him on
- the table.

22:33.186 --> 22:34.980
Okay. I need a needle,

22:34.981 --> 22:36.773
thread, and 300 CCs

22:33.186 --> 22:36.773
of stuffing. Stat!

22:38.149 --> 22:39.297
Do you really think

22:39.298 --> 22:40.443
you can fix him?

22:40.568 --> 22:42.153
Hey.

22:42.279 --> 22:43.467
If I can fix Zuri's pony

22:43.468 --> 22:44.655
after it went through

22:42.279 --> 22:44.655
Mr. Kipling,

22:44.781 --> 22:45.781
I can fix anything.

22:47.825 --> 22:49.119
Her tail is where

22:49.120 --> 22:50.411
her head used to be.

22:50.536 --> 22:52.205
- But she can still
- run like the wind.

22:55.708 --> 22:57.728
- Well, I'm still here.
- I guess your Mystical iBall

22:57.752 --> 22:59.295
Application isn't

22:59.296 --> 23:00.838
all-knowing after all.

23:00.964 --> 23:02.800
I guess a $3 computer

23:02.801 --> 23:04.634
application cannot hold

23:00.964 --> 23:04.634
all the answers

23:04.759 --> 23:05.759
to life's mysteries.

23:06.803 --> 23:08.596
Yeah, those cost 4.99.

23:10.723 --> 23:11.266
(CELL PHONE RINGS)

23:11.390 --> 23:13.059
Blocked number?

23:13.977 --> 23:15.728
Hello?

23:15.853 --> 23:17.188
Lukey-pookie, it's Connie.

23:17.189 --> 23:18.522
I decided to forgive you.

23:18.648 --> 23:20.984
I'm taking you back.
