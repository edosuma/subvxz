Hello there.

00:16.467 --> 00:19.133
We have special visitors today
on "Sesame Street."

00:19.200 --> 00:21.667
My granny bird is here

00:21.734 --> 00:24.100
because today is all
about grandparents.

00:24.166 --> 00:25.133
Mm-hmm.

00:25.200 --> 00:27.200
I'm so happy
to see you, Big Bird.

00:27.266 --> 00:30.033
I love you so much,
I knit you a sweater...

00:30.100 --> 00:31.467
Oh.

00:31.533 --> 00:34.433
...And then
accidentally shrunk it
in the wash.

00:34.500 --> 00:36.567
Oh. Well, that's OK,
Granny Bird.

00:36.633 --> 00:39.700
Radar loves it.
Thank you.

wonderful grandparents

Have you seen this place?
It's beautiful.

01:32.700 --> 01:34.633
Elmo's so excited!
Elmo's so excited! Yay!

01:34.700 --> 01:36.066
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, Elmo.

01:36.133 --> 01:37.467
Oh, Elmo,
look who's here,
buddy.

01:37.533 --> 01:39.033
Oh, oh, hi.

01:39.100 --> 01:40.367
Hey, welcome
to Sesame Street.

01:40.433 --> 01:42.300
You're just in time.

01:42.367 --> 01:43.400
Today, Hooper's store
is throwing

01:43.467 --> 01:45.166
a very special
kind of party.

01:45.233 --> 01:46.266
Mm-hmm.
That's right.

01:46.333 --> 01:47.266
Today is
our first-ever--

01:47.333 --> 01:48.433
Oh, let--let
Elmo say it,

01:48.500 --> 01:50.300
- Chris, please, please, please.
- Go ahead, Elmo.

01:50.367 --> 01:54.467
It's our first-ever
grandparents celebration. Yay!

01:54.533 --> 01:57.100
Yeah. Today we're having
a big, big party

01:57.166 --> 01:59.300
just for kids
and their grandparents.

01:59.367 --> 02:02.200
And I think we're getting
a bigger turnout than expected.

02:02.266 --> 02:03.600
You know what?
I think we're gonna

02:03.667 --> 02:04.600
need some more chairs.

02:04.667 --> 02:05.734
- Oh, good.
- Oh, no worries.

02:05.800 --> 02:07.066
- I'm right on it.
- Thanks, Chris.

02:07.133 --> 02:08.567
Oh, boy,
oh, boy, oh, boy.

02:08.633 --> 02:10.767
Elmo can't wait
till his grandma
and grandpa get here.

02:10.834 --> 02:13.633
Elmo hasn't seen them
in a long time.

02:13.700 --> 02:15.133
Yeah. They live
pretty far away, right?

02:15.200 --> 02:17.166
Yeah, yeah, yeah. See?
Here's a picture of them.

02:17.233 --> 02:20.100
Yeah. When grandma
and grandpa visit,

02:20.166 --> 02:22.033
we have so much fun.

02:22.100 --> 02:23.400
Oh.

02:23.467 --> 02:24.567
I know you love them a lot.

02:24.633 --> 02:28.166
Yeah.

Hey, Elmo, Elmo.

03:32.200 --> 03:33.800
Oh.

03:33.867 --> 03:36.000
Hey, Elmo, I need
to talk to you.

03:36.066 --> 03:37.700
Oh, well, talk fast,
Chris, 'cause--

03:37.767 --> 03:39.200
'cause Elmo's grandma
and grandpa

03:39.266 --> 03:40.367
will be here
any minute.

03:40.433 --> 03:41.367
Buddy, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

03:41.433 --> 03:42.367
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:42.433 --> 03:43.367
Um, I just got
off the phone with them.

03:43.433 --> 03:46.000
Their flight got canceled.

03:46.066 --> 03:48.600
So they're not coming?

03:48.667 --> 03:50.934
It's just that they won't
get here until tomorrow.

03:51.000 --> 03:55.300
But they'll miss
the grandparents
celebration today.

03:55.367 --> 03:57.300
I'm sorry. I know
you're disappointed.

03:57.367 --> 03:59.734
Elmo's really
disappointed.

03:59.800 --> 04:01.066
Elmo really wanted to come

04:01.133 --> 04:03.066
to the party
with his grandparents.

04:03.133 --> 04:04.500
Well, you know what?

04:04.567 --> 04:06.767
Maybe we could fill in

04:06.834 --> 04:08.567
and pretend to be
your grandparents today.

04:08.633 --> 04:10.333
Hey, yeah.

04:10.400 --> 04:12.200
We could be your substitute
grandparents. Yeah.

04:12.266 --> 04:14.467
- Of course, buddy, yeah.

04:14.533 --> 04:16.100
OK, OK! Come on! Come on!

04:16.166 --> 04:17.600
Come on! Come on!
Come on! Come on! Come on!

04:17.667 --> 04:19.000
Chris: Hey!

04:19.066 --> 04:22.700
Boy, Elmo's good. Hee hee!
Oh. Come on in, grandparents.

04:22.767 --> 04:25.233
Um, hey, Elmo, listen.

04:25.300 --> 04:28.333
When I said we would be
your substitute grandparents,

04:28.400 --> 04:31.333
I didn't think we would have
to dress up like them.

04:31.400 --> 04:34.400
But Alan kind of looks
like Elmo's grandpa.

04:34.467 --> 04:35.834
Look. See, see, see?

04:35.900 --> 04:38.600
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I do.
Hey, I'm liking the beard.

04:38.667 --> 04:41.233
- It's very sophisticated.
- It is. Hee hee!

04:41.300 --> 04:44.166
Oh. Now where's
Elmo's substitute grandma?

04:44.233 --> 04:45.567
Oh, come on out, Chris.

04:45.633 --> 04:47.300
Chris: I'd rather not.

04:47.367 --> 04:49.033
Oh, come on.
Please, Chris?

04:49.100 --> 04:50.433
Chris: Ugh...

04:50.500 --> 04:51.800
Ah, there.

04:51.867 --> 04:53.133
Do I really have
to wear all this?

04:53.200 --> 04:55.033
Hey, come on.
If it makes him
feel better...

04:55.100 --> 04:56.667
All right,
all right, all right.

04:56.734 --> 04:59.533
Well, Chris kind of looks
like Elmo's grandma...

04:59.600 --> 05:01.000
- Yeah.
- OK.

05:01.066 --> 05:02.800
But his voice is
a little too low.

05:02.867 --> 05:05.033
Could Chris talk
a little higher?

05:05.100 --> 05:06.567
Uh...

05:06.633 --> 05:07.800
Like this?

05:07.867 --> 05:08.800
Higher.

05:08.867 --> 05:10.300
Like this?

05:10.367 --> 05:11.300
Higher.

05:11.367 --> 05:12.734
I don't think I can go

05:12.800 --> 05:13.734
any higher than this.

05:13.800 --> 05:15.033
Ha ha ha!

05:15.100 --> 05:17.000
Oh, Alan, Alan,
that's not the way

05:17.066 --> 05:18.734
Elmo's grandpa laughs.

05:18.800 --> 05:20.467
- Oh.
- It's much lower.

05:20.533 --> 05:21.467
Um...

05:23.300 --> 05:24.433
Uh, lower.

05:26.800 --> 05:28.000
Lower.

05:28.066 --> 05:31.767
Huh huh huh huh huh.

05:31.834 --> 05:34.734
Not so easy, is it?

05:34.800 --> 05:36.300
Oh, this isn't working.

05:36.367 --> 05:39.266
No matter how much
Chris and Alan try,

05:39.333 --> 05:41.667
they're not really
Elmo's grandparents.

05:41.734 --> 05:43.000
No. We're not,
and, you know,

05:43.066 --> 05:44.500
we don't want
to take their place.

05:44.567 --> 05:46.166
No, Elmo. We just wanted
you to feel included

05:46.233 --> 05:47.700
in the grandparents
celebration.

05:47.767 --> 05:50.133
Well, thanks anyway,
but it just isn't the same

05:50.200 --> 05:52.533
without grandma
and grandpa.

05:52.600 --> 05:54.133
Maybe Elmo should
just go home.

05:54.200 --> 05:55.700
Oh, no, no.
Hey, Elmo, come on.

05:55.767 --> 05:57.266
There's still so many
nice people here

05:57.333 --> 05:58.266
for you to meet.

05:58.333 --> 06:01.533
Elmo! Elmo!
¡Ay, mama!

06:01.600 --> 06:05.166
Uh, anyway, you haven't met
my abuela yet. Come on.

06:05.233 --> 06:07.166
Waah! Whoa!

06:07.233 --> 06:10.800
Elmo, this is my abuela.

06:10.867 --> 06:13.333
That's Spanish
for grandmother.

06:13.400 --> 06:15.100
Hola, Elmo.

06:15.166 --> 06:18.266
Um, hi,
Rosita's umbrella.

06:18.333 --> 06:19.967
- Abuela. Uh-huh.
- Abuela.

06:20.033 --> 06:21.033
- Yeah.
- Abuela. OK.

06:21.100 --> 06:22.300
She was just teaching me
a song from Mexico.

06:22.367 --> 06:24.367
- Oh, yeah, yeah. Sure.

06:24.433 --> 06:27.667
Ok. This is a song
that I would sing

06:27.734 --> 06:30.333
when I was
a little girl.

06:32.233 --> 06:34.600

07:02.266 --> 07:04.667
Wow. That's so pretty,
but what does it mean?

07:04.734 --> 07:07.066
The song is telling
you to sing

07:07.133 --> 07:08.300
when you are feeling sad

07:08.367 --> 07:11.400
because singing
makes your heart happy.

07:11.467 --> 07:13.567
Oh. Well, Elmo
was feeling sad.

07:13.633 --> 07:16.166
Maybe singing
is just what Elmo needs.

07:16.233 --> 07:17.400
Then sing with us.

07:17.467 --> 07:20.500

07:37.433 --> 07:38.700
Aw, thank you.
Hee hee hee!

07:38.767 --> 07:40.400
Hey, hey,
hey, hey, buddy.

07:40.467 --> 07:41.667
Looks like you're
feeling better, huh?

07:41.734 --> 07:43.500
Oh, yeah.
Elmo does feel happier.

07:43.567 --> 07:45.133
The singing helped.

07:45.200 --> 07:48.166
Oh, thanks, Rosita,
Rosita's abuela.

07:48.233 --> 07:50.100
- Ha ha ha! Yeah.

07:50.166 --> 07:53.500
Boy, it's just too bad
Elmo cant share his happiness

07:53.567 --> 07:55.400
with his own grandparents.

07:56.800 --> 07:58.600
- ¡Ay, mama!
- ¡Ay, mama!

07:58.667 --> 08:00.400
- I don't know.

08:00.467 --> 08:01.967
What is that sound?

08:06.066 --> 08:08.000
Hey, uh,
what's that sound?

08:08.066 --> 08:10.000
It's my portable computer.

08:10.066 --> 08:11.233
Don't worry.
I'm on it.

08:12.600 --> 08:13.834
I have an idea.

08:13.900 --> 08:15.233
Can I use your computer
for just a second?

08:15.300 --> 08:17.200
Oh, yeah.
Be my guest, baby.

08:17.266 --> 08:19.266
Somebody ought to get
some use out of this.

08:19.333 --> 08:21.000
Hey, looks like this
grandparents celebration

08:21.066 --> 08:22.433
was a huge hit.

08:22.500 --> 08:25.066
You know what?
We are gonna do this
every year.

08:25.133 --> 08:26.400
Chris: OK.

08:26.467 --> 08:28.567
Maybe next year,
Elmo's grandparents

08:28.633 --> 08:30.367
will be able to come.

08:30.433 --> 08:31.934
Chris: Or maybe...

08:32.000 --> 08:35.567
your grandparents can
sort of come this year.

08:37.767 --> 08:39.333
- Elmo's grandma: Elmo!
- Elmo's grandpa: Hey, Elmo.

08:39.400 --> 08:41.900
Grandma! Grandpa!
Ha ha ha!

08:41.967 --> 08:43.967
Elmo's grandma: Oh, Elmo,
honey, we are so sorry

08:44.033 --> 08:46.066
we couldn't get
there today.

08:46.133 --> 08:48.433
Elmo's grandpa: Yeah.
We wanted to be with you

08:48.500 --> 08:50.633
for your--
for your grandparents
celebration.

08:50.700 --> 08:55.100
Oh, well, so did Elmo,
but this is really cool, too.

08:55.166 --> 08:57.600
Oh, Elmo's so happy
to see both of you.

08:57.667 --> 08:59.700
Elmo's grandma:
Oh, we are, too, darling,

08:59.767 --> 09:03.166
and we'll be there
tomorrow in person.

09:03.233 --> 09:04.734
Elmo's grandpa: Yeah.

09:04.800 --> 09:06.633
Oh, well, Elmo can't wait,
but now Elmo wants you

09:06.700 --> 09:08.233
to meet some
of his friends.

Nasir:
My grandma is the greatest

10:30.133 --> 10:32.600
because she loves us
more than anything.

Nasir: We love to build
sand castles at the beach

11:00.800 --> 11:02.033

13:27.100 --> 13:29.066
- Oh, I'll check the recipe.
- Yeah.

13:30.533 --> 13:33.100
Gonger:
Buttermilk, flour...

13:33.166 --> 13:38.300
butter, and the secret
ingredient-- the honey.

13:38.367 --> 13:41.000
OK. We got
the buttermilk,

13:41.066 --> 13:44.800
um, flour, and butter,
OK, and, oh--

13:44.867 --> 13:49.200
Uh-oh! We out of honey.

13:49.266 --> 13:50.567
No honey?

13:50.633 --> 13:52.433
But we gotta
have the honey.

13:52.500 --> 13:54.767
Oh, what are we gonna do?

13:54.834 --> 13:56.967
Oh, well, we'll just
have to make more.

13:57.033 --> 13:59.867
Uh, you know anyone
who can make honey?

13:59.934 --> 14:01.233
- Bees.

14:01.300 --> 14:03.433
No, no, no, no.
The bees make the honey.

14:03.500 --> 14:07.100
Bees make honey?
You know any bees?

14:07.166 --> 14:08.867
No, but I know
where to find some.

14:08.934 --> 14:09.967
Follow me.

14:17.433 --> 14:20.433
- To the bee farm!
- To the bee farm!

14:22.800 --> 14:25.533
Cookie Monster:
We're going to the bee farm.

14:31.133 --> 14:32.066
Cookie Monster:
Where the honey?

14:32.133 --> 14:33.400
Me don't see any honey.

14:33.467 --> 14:35.100
Gonger:
Oh, ask the beekeeper.

14:35.166 --> 14:36.734
Hello, Mr. Beekeeper.

14:36.800 --> 14:39.600
Can you please help us?
We need honey.

14:39.667 --> 14:41.066
Hey, Cookie Monster
and Gonger.

14:41.133 --> 14:42.633
You've come to the right place.

14:42.700 --> 14:44.867
Welcome to the bee farm.

14:44.934 --> 14:46.967
Cookie Monster:
But, uh, where all the honey?

14:47.033 --> 14:48.433
The honey is in these hives.

14:48.500 --> 14:51.600
Beekeeper: After the bees
gather nectar from the flowers,

14:51.667 --> 14:54.233
they bring it back
to the hive to make honey.

14:54.300 --> 14:56.400
When the honey's ready,
we take the honeycomb

14:56.467 --> 14:59.033
from the hive,

14:59.100 --> 15:00.834
then it's put into a spinner.

15:03.433 --> 15:05.100
The honey is collected...

15:07.467 --> 15:09.867
and eventually put
into bottles...

15:09.934 --> 15:13.000
so that people can enjoy it.

15:16.600 --> 15:19.433
Bees are the only insects
that give us food,

15:19.500 --> 15:21.200
and here's some for you.

15:21.266 --> 15:22.367
Cookie Monster:
Thank you, Mr. Beekeeper.

15:22.433 --> 15:23.600
Gonger:
Thank you.

15:23.667 --> 15:24.600
- Cookie Monster: We got honey

15:24.667 --> 15:26.400
from the bee farm.

15:28.667 --> 15:30.200
Hey, we got
the secret ingredient.

15:30.266 --> 15:33.133
Now we can make
you grandma's
buttermilk biscuits.

15:33.200 --> 15:34.900
Yay! OK.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.400
I'm gonna look
at the recipe.

15:36.467 --> 15:40.033
Hmm, we need one cup of flour...

15:40.100 --> 15:41.734
One cup of flour.

15:41.800 --> 15:43.567
Gonger: And some butter...

15:43.633 --> 15:45.100
Cookie Monster: Butter.

15:45.166 --> 15:48.433
Now I'm gonna
mash it. Yeah.

15:48.500 --> 15:50.133
Gonger:
Dump the honey--

15:50.200 --> 15:53.033
Yeah, uh-huh, yeah--

15:53.100 --> 15:56.500
Oh, and the buttermilk.

15:56.567 --> 15:58.333
Now whisk 'em!

16:00.467 --> 16:01.367
Gonger: Yeah.

16:03.100 --> 16:05.300
Then mix everything
together.

16:06.400 --> 16:08.467
Gonger: Ho ho! Ooh!

16:08.533 --> 16:11.567
Stir, stir, stir.
Stir, stir, stir.

16:11.633 --> 16:12.567

16:25.667 --> 16:27.433
OK.
Into the oven.

wondering about today.

20:47.166 --> 20:49.367
Wait for it.

Wait for it!

20:52.834 --> 20:55.567
Oh, ho ho ho!
It's grandparents!

20:55.633 --> 20:58.300
Oh, hi, Grandma.
Hi, Grandpa.

20:58.367 --> 20:59.567
Hi, Elmo.

20:59.633 --> 21:01.300
Ha ha ha!

21:01.367 --> 21:03.600
Boy, Elmo
loves grandparents

21:03.667 --> 21:06.734
and wants to find out
more about them.

21:06.800 --> 21:10.400
Hey, hey! Let's ask
Elmo's friend, Smartie!

21:10.467 --> 21:12.633
Let's call her together.

21:12.700 --> 21:15.367
♪ Oh, Smartie! ♪

( Smartie playing

21:17.400 --> 21:19.033
Hiya, Elmo!

21:19.100 --> 21:20.700
Oh, wait a minute.
Where you going, Smartie?

21:20.767 --> 21:22.100
Oh, I can't
stay long, Elmo.

21:22.166 --> 21:24.667
I'm going to visit
my grandpa, Cord.

21:24.734 --> 21:27.233
Oh, ho ho! Well,
that's perfect, Smartie,

21:27.300 --> 21:30.934
because Elmo wants to learn
all about grandparents today.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.000
Well, what do we do
to learn something new?

21:33.066 --> 21:36.000
All:
We look it up.

21:36.066 --> 21:37.734
Searching
for grandparents.

21:37.800 --> 21:40.066
Here we go.

21:40.133 --> 21:42.967
Grandparents are part
of your family.

21:43.033 --> 21:47.066
Your mother and father's parents
are your grandparents.

21:47.133 --> 21:49.533
Grandparents can help
take care of you.

21:49.600 --> 21:53.533
Some grandparents live nearby,
and some live far away.

21:53.600 --> 21:56.200
You can talk to them
on the phone,

21:56.266 --> 21:58.834
send them letters and drawings,

21:58.900 --> 22:00.734
or video chat.

22:00.800 --> 22:03.800
Grandparents are grand.

22:03.867 --> 22:06.600
Wow. Thank you
for helping Elmo

22:06.667 --> 22:09.200
learn more
about grandparents,
Smartie.

22:09.266 --> 22:12.033
Sure thing, Elmo.
I got to run now.

22:12.100 --> 22:14.133
I'm going to see
my grandpa, Cord.

22:14.200 --> 22:16.834
We're going
to play phone tag.

22:16.900 --> 22:18.667
- Oh, ho ho ho!
- Bye, Elmo.

22:18.734 --> 22:20.834
Oh, bye-bye, Smartie.

22:20.900 --> 22:22.100
Thank you.

22:22.166 --> 22:25.633
Boy, grandparents
are really special.

22:25.700 --> 22:29.734
Oh, hey,
that gives Elmo an idea.

22:29.800 --> 22:32.533
Oh, let's play
a game together.

22:32.600 --> 22:36.433
Yeah. Come on.
Come on. Ha ha ha!

22:42.700 --> 22:44.400
Oh, Elmo's friend, Autumn,

22:44.467 --> 22:47.200
wants to bring
her grandma a muffin.

22:47.266 --> 22:49.367
Oh, let's see
if we can help her.

22:49.433 --> 22:53.800
Are you ready? Let's play.
Which way should we go?

22:53.867 --> 22:55.333
Kid 1: Go down.

22:55.400 --> 22:58.033
Kid 2: Yeah. Down.

22:58.100 --> 23:00.266
Elmo:
Which way should Autumn go?

23:00.333 --> 23:02.700
Do you go over the bridge
or take the flower path?

23:02.767 --> 23:04.400
Kid 1: Bridge.

23:04.467 --> 23:07.300
Kid 3:
Go over the bridge.

23:07.367 --> 23:10.266
Elmo:
Now which way?

23:10.333 --> 23:11.266
Kid: No.

23:11.333 --> 23:12.333
Elmo: Uh-oh.

23:12.400 --> 23:14.133
Does Grandma live
in a tree?

23:14.200 --> 23:15.433
Kid: Go back.

23:15.500 --> 23:17.266
Kid 2:
Keep going down.

23:17.333 --> 23:20.233
Kid 3:
Through the woods.

23:20.300 --> 23:24.400
Elmo:
Now which way? Up. Go up.

23:25.967 --> 23:28.000
Oh, ho ho!
We did it!

23:28.066 --> 23:31.533
Oh, we helped get
the muffins to Grandma,

23:31.600 --> 23:35.166
oh, and that makes
Elmo wonder even more.

23:35.233 --> 23:38.633
Does Mr. Noodle give
gifts to his grandma?

23:38.700 --> 23:40.600
Oh, let's ask him.
Ho ho ho!

23:40.667 --> 23:43.467
Hey, Mr. Noodle!

23:43.533 --> 23:46.066
Kid:
Hee hee hee! Mr. Noodle!

23:46.133 --> 23:47.700
Hi, Mr. Noodle.

23:47.767 --> 23:49.133
Oh. Elmo was wondering...

23:49.200 --> 23:51.767
Does Mr. Noodle
bring presents

23:51.834 --> 23:54.033
to Grandma Noodle?

23:54.100 --> 23:58.100
Elmo:
No? Mr. Noodle!

23:58.166 --> 24:00.266
Grandma noodle lives far away,

24:00.333 --> 24:03.633
so Mr. Noodle sends presents.

24:03.700 --> 24:06.133
Oh, is that a present
for Grandma Noodle?

24:06.200 --> 24:07.734
Yeah? Let's see.

24:07.800 --> 24:10.266
Kid: A waffle
with a bite out of it.

24:10.333 --> 24:11.667
Elmo: Mr. Noodle,

24:11.734 --> 24:14.467
your breakfast
is not a nice gift.

24:14.533 --> 24:17.166
Oh, Mr. Noodle! Silly.

24:17.233 --> 24:19.300
What

24:19.367 --> 24:22.967
Oh, is Grandma Noodle
a hockey player?

24:23.033 --> 24:26.266
Oh. That is not a good gift.

24:26.333 --> 24:30.266
Kid:
Flowers! That's a nice gift.

24:33.066 --> 24:35.233
Elmo: Wait a minute.
What's he doing?

24:35.300 --> 24:38.734
What? Mr. Noodle! No.

24:38.800 --> 24:42.000
That's not how
you send a package.

24:42.066 --> 24:44.467
Oh? Ho ho ho!

24:44.533 --> 24:46.133
Kid: Mr. Noodle!

24:46.200 --> 24:47.734
