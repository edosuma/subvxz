00:09.300 --> 00:11.300
Oh, god!

00:11.300 --> 00:13.300
Ryan!
-Oh, my god!

00:13.300 --> 00:14.800
Oh, fuck!

00:14.800 --> 00:16.200
Should we keep going?

00:16.200 --> 00:20.000
-Run! Run!

00:22.800 --> 00:24.000
-Okay. I think I got this.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.200
Why am I always behind
the camera again?

00:26.200 --> 00:28.000
-Because you're good at it.
Besides,

00:28.000 --> 00:30.900
you're the only guy I know
who could operate that thing.

00:30.900 --> 00:33.000
-Okay. I think we're ready.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.800
Ryan, come on, man.
You look fine.

00:34.800 --> 00:36.600
-Yeah. You're supposed
to say that. You're my brother.

00:36.600 --> 00:38.400
-Look, I'm your brother
and I give you noogies

00:38.400 --> 00:40.700
and harass you at other times,
but I'm not your girlfriend.

00:40.700 --> 00:42.300
I'm not supposed
to compliment you.

00:42.300 --> 00:43.900
-Well, thanks
for the compliment.

00:43.900 --> 00:45.900
-Yeah. Yeah.
Well, are you ready?

00:47.200 --> 00:52.000
Honestly?
I'm feeling kinda nervous.

00:53.200 --> 00:54.200
-Well, we're going
around all day,

00:54.200 --> 00:56.300
talking to doctors
and scientists,

00:56.300 --> 00:58.700
talking about stuff that's way
out of my league. It's...

00:58.700 --> 01:00.100
-Ryan. Ryan. Ryan. Look at me.
-intimidating, man.

01:00.100 --> 01:02.200
-I'm your brother.

01:02.200 --> 01:04.599
You got this.

01:04.599 --> 01:07.900
-Yeah, we're ready.

01:10.100 --> 01:11.900
All right.
We're gonna get set up.

01:11.900 --> 01:14.100
Yeah, okay. Let's get set up.

01:14.100 --> 01:16.700
Dr. Bennett, would you
please mind explaining

01:16.700 --> 01:20.100
why you're against using animals
as medical test subjects?

01:22.600 --> 01:26.100
-Well, do you know there are
certain medicines and products

01:26.100 --> 01:29.900
that are harmful to animals,
but very valuable to humans?

01:29.900 --> 01:32.400
Aspirin, for instance.
It was almost shelved

01:32.400 --> 01:35.100
because it proved
dangerous for animals.

01:35.100 --> 01:36.900
Now, can you imagine
what would've happened

01:36.900 --> 01:40.000
if aspirin was completely taken
off the pharmaceutical list?

01:40.000 --> 01:42.600
-There would be no way
of lowering the risk

01:42.600 --> 01:45.500
of organ-transplant failures
or heart attacks.

01:45.500 --> 01:47.700
-Exactly!

01:47.700 --> 01:50.900
-So, you're against
animal testing.

01:50.900 --> 01:52.200
Is that correct, Dr. Gomez?

01:52.200 --> 01:55.500
-That's correct.
I am against animal testing.

01:55.500 --> 01:58.300
You see, the protocols
used in animal testing

01:58.300 --> 02:02.500
are often cruel and painful
to the animal subjects.

02:02.500 --> 02:07.900
They are force-fed,
or deprived of food and water.

02:07.900 --> 02:10.100
They are physically restrained

02:10.100 --> 02:14.700
and inflicted
with painful burns and wounds

02:14.700 --> 02:22.500
to test the efficacy of healing
remedies and products,

02:22.500 --> 02:25.900
and then, when they're done,
when they've served a purpose,

02:25.900 --> 02:29.100
their necks are broken,
or they're asphyxiated.

02:29.100 --> 02:32.600
-I had no idea.

02:32.600 --> 02:37.100
-In the case
of cosmetics testing,

02:37.100 --> 02:39.300
they'll take a rabbit

02:39.300 --> 02:43.100
and they will incapacitate
the rabbit

02:43.100 --> 02:46.300
and attach clips to its eyes,

02:46.300 --> 02:49.900
so that it can't blink away
the product being tested.

02:49.900 --> 02:53.600
And those clips will stay
on its eyes for days.

02:53.600 --> 02:56.100
Or, in the case
of chemical testing,

02:56.100 --> 02:59.600
like pesticides, herbicides,
and things like that,

02:59.600 --> 03:06.200
they'll expose the animal to
lethal levels of toxic chemicals

03:06.200 --> 03:09.300
to see how much will sicken
or kill the animal.

03:09.300 --> 03:11.400
-Wow.

03:11.400 --> 03:13.800
I had no idea.

03:13.800 --> 03:15.800
-There you go.
That's the problem.

03:15.800 --> 03:19.300
Most people have no idea
about what's going on behind

03:19.300 --> 03:24.300
the closed doors of these test
facilities and laboratories.

03:24.300 --> 03:28.300
-So, is there anything else you
would like to add, Dr. Gomez?

03:28.300 --> 03:30.200
-There is.

03:30.200 --> 03:34.300
Millions of animals are burned,
crippled, or poisoned every year

03:34.300 --> 03:37.500
in laboratories
around the world.

03:37.500 --> 03:40.100
92% of all experimental drugs

03:40.100 --> 03:43.100
tested safe and effective
on animals

03:43.100 --> 03:45.800
fail in human clinical studies

03:45.800 --> 03:49.600
as being unsafe,
ineffective, or dangerous.

03:52.300 --> 03:55.300
Funds and resources
should be focused

03:55.300 --> 04:00.900
on animal-free alternatives,
alternatives that are more

04:00.900 --> 04:05.200
ethical, humane,
and inexpensive.

04:05.200 --> 04:08.900
One such alternative
would be the microfluidic chip.

04:08.900 --> 04:14.300
It's a silicon or polycarbonate
chip lined with human cells

04:14.300 --> 04:17.899
and replicates the function
of human organs.

04:17.899 --> 04:23.500
It can sort, pump, and mix.

04:23.500 --> 04:26.900
With technology like this,
we no longer need

04:26.900 --> 04:30.800
a whole living-body system
to conduct experiments on

04:30.800 --> 04:34.200
and researchers
can't claim that they do.

04:34.200 --> 04:37.500
-Thank you very much, Doctor.
-Thank you.

04:37.500 --> 04:41.100
Your project
is giving a platform

04:41.100 --> 04:43.800
to a wide variety
of differing opinions

04:43.800 --> 04:47.100
and, for that,
I am eternally grateful.

04:47.100 --> 04:50.100
You see, it's time
the world knows.

04:50.100 --> 04:54.100
It's time the world
can see what's going on,

04:54.100 --> 04:56.500
whether we're gonna continue

04:56.500 --> 04:59.200
living in the dark ages
of clinical research,

04:59.200 --> 05:02.300
or whether we're gonna step
into the enlightened world

05:02.300 --> 05:04.200
of advancing technologies.

05:06.200 --> 05:08.000
-Okay.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.700
Go set up over there.
All right.

05:09.700 --> 05:11.500
Get these lights
for the perfect shot

05:11.500 --> 05:15.600
and not make them fucking
fall over, so here we go.

05:15.600 --> 05:17.300
Hey, Sienna!

05:17.300 --> 05:19.200
Can you explain
for the fine folks at home

05:19.200 --> 05:21.100
what exactly we're doing?

05:21.100 --> 05:24.300
-I'm trying to start Ryan's
4:00 video chat.

05:26.400 --> 05:29.400
-It's 5:00.
-I'm computer illiterate.

05:29.400 --> 05:31.500
-In 2017.

05:31.500 --> 05:33.600
I'm behind on the times.
-Oh, I know what you can say,

05:33.600 --> 05:37.100
and it's,
"Do you want fries with that?"

05:37.100 --> 05:39.200
Real mature. Real mature.

05:39.200 --> 05:41.300
-Hey, Max.
Could you come in here, please?

05:41.300 --> 05:44.300
-Mighty Max!
-Maximilian!

05:46.300 --> 05:49.200
-Hello, Max.
-Hello. Taking a shit.

05:49.200 --> 05:51.600
Sorry.

05:51.600 --> 05:52.800
-I can't figure this out.

05:52.800 --> 05:55.200
-Hey, babe.

05:55.200 --> 05:57.500
-That one --
-Gunner, be professional!

05:57.500 --> 06:00.600
-I didn't know saying hey
to my lady was unprofessional.

06:00.600 --> 06:02.300
-Do you not know
who you're talking to?

06:02.300 --> 06:03.700
-Yeah. Have you still not
figured it out yet?

06:03.700 --> 06:05.900
-I've tried everything.

06:05.900 --> 06:08.200
Maybe this computer just isn't
compatible with video chat.

06:08.200 --> 06:10.400
-Babe, we've used
this exact computer

06:10.400 --> 06:12.300
to video chat
like a million times.

06:12.300 --> 06:13.700
-Well, what if you
deleted the app?

06:13.700 --> 06:15.900
I don't know.
-Hold on.

06:15.900 --> 06:17.300
Has anybody checked the Wi

06:17.300 --> 06:19.700
-Yeah. Why would
the Wi

06:19.700 --> 06:21.800
Because I shut it off.

06:23.500 --> 06:25.300
-I thought it would make
for an interesting segment

06:25.300 --> 06:26.300
in our film.

06:26.300 --> 06:29.400
-Ugghh!
-Grrrrr!

06:29.400 --> 06:32.300
-Ah, here.

06:34.200 --> 06:35.900
-Oh!
-Go go go go go, go!

06:35.900 --> 06:37.800
-Dr. Reeves,

06:37.800 --> 06:40.100
very, very sorry.

06:40.100 --> 06:43.200
Thanks again for joining us
tonight, Dr. Reeves.

06:43.200 --> 06:45.100
-Absolutely.
More than happy to help.

06:45.100 --> 06:48.500
-Now, you're a doctor
in what, exactly?

06:48.500 --> 06:49.600
-I'm an oncologist.

06:49.600 --> 06:51.100
I treat cancer patients.

06:51.100 --> 06:54.800
-Well, I imagine that must be
very difficult for you.

06:54.800 --> 06:56.900
-It can be,
but I do my best not

06:56.900 --> 06:58.900
to let my emotions get
in the way of my work.

06:58.900 --> 07:01.800
-Mm-hmm. Understandable.

07:01.800 --> 07:03.900
We spoke on the phone
a few weeks ago

07:03.900 --> 07:05.300
and I wanna thank you
very much again

07:05.300 --> 07:08.400
for taking some of your time
to help me with my project,

07:08.400 --> 07:10.100
but I don't wanna take up
too much of your time,

07:10.100 --> 07:13.500
so do you mind if we just
go ahead and get things started?

07:13.500 --> 07:15.500
-Like I said, I'm glad
I could help you

07:15.500 --> 07:18.200
and, yes, we can get started.
-All right.

07:18.200 --> 07:23.300
So, Dr. Reeves, where do you
stand currently on using animals

07:23.300 --> 07:28.200
as subjects for medical
and chemical treatments?

07:28.200 --> 07:31.200
-I mean, it's a very
double

07:31.200 --> 07:32.600
-Mm.
-On one hand,

07:32.600 --> 07:33.900
you have to realize that, yes,

07:33.900 --> 07:37.200
it's helpful to human
beings, undeniably.

07:37.200 --> 07:40.600
No other living thing
on this planet

07:40.600 --> 07:43.100
has the closest anatomical
structure to humans

07:43.100 --> 07:45.800
than apes, specifically.

07:45.800 --> 07:48.200
A human body
is extremely complex,

07:48.200 --> 07:51.400
so much so that cell
cultures in a Petri dish

07:51.400 --> 07:54.200
cannot provide
sufficient test results

07:54.200 --> 07:57.900
or prove that a cure
or product is effective.

07:57.900 --> 08:00.800
Testing a drug for side
effects, for example,

08:00.800 --> 08:03.100
requires a circulatory system

08:03.100 --> 08:05.500
that's going to carry the drug
to different organs.

08:05.500 --> 08:06.800
-Mm-hmm.
-Now, studying

08:06.800 --> 08:09.600
interrelated processes
is also best done

08:09.600 --> 08:12.200
in subjects
with endocrine systems,

08:12.200 --> 08:15.200
immune systems,
central nervous systems,

08:15.200 --> 08:18.300
something that humans
and apes have.

08:18.300 --> 08:21.100
Then again, despite
what proponents insist,

08:21.100 --> 08:25.300
cell cultures in a Petri dish
or in vitro testing

08:25.300 --> 08:28.700
are not exactly useless
or insufficient.

08:28.700 --> 08:30.400
They can even produce results

08:30.400 --> 08:34.600
that are more relevant
than animal experimentation.

08:34.600 --> 08:35.700
Now, the same thing is true

08:35.700 --> 08:37.400
when using
artificial human skin

08:37.400 --> 08:40.500
as a test subject,
instead of animal skin.

08:40.500 --> 08:44.100
Virtual reconstructions
of human molecular structures

08:44.100 --> 08:47.200
done through computer models
also have the capacity

08:47.200 --> 08:50.200
to predict toxicity
levels of substances,

08:50.200 --> 08:51.900
so no need to poison animals

08:51.900 --> 08:55.800
to collect data
and draw conclusions.

08:55.800 --> 08:58.100
And, when testing
for adverse reactions,

08:58.100 --> 09:00.400
administering small doses
on humans,

09:00.400 --> 09:04.900
also known on microdosing,
also offers an alternative.

09:04.900 --> 09:07.500
Combine that
with blood analysis,

09:07.500 --> 09:10.200
results will be produced.

09:10.200 --> 09:12.200
Now, what needs to be
noted here, though,

09:12.200 --> 09:15.200
is that these alternatives
are less expensive

09:15.200 --> 09:17.800
than animal experimentations.

09:17.800 --> 09:21.600
In-glass testing, for example,
only costs $11,000,

09:21.600 --> 09:24.700
which is less than the $21,000

09:24.700 --> 09:28.700
currently for an unscheduled
DNA synthesis.

09:28.700 --> 09:32.200
A phototoxicity test
that does not use rats

09:32.200 --> 09:36.100
only costs $1,300,
which is almost $10,000 less

09:36.100 --> 09:38.600
than its
animal-based equivalent.

09:38.600 --> 09:41.400
Now, these show that animal
tests are wasting plenty

09:41.400 --> 09:44.300
of government dollars
allocated for research.

09:44.300 --> 09:48.200
-So, what you're saying is that,

09:48.200 --> 09:52.800
with a little more time spent
using Petri testing or in vitro,

09:52.800 --> 09:55.100
that we could replicate
the same results,

09:55.100 --> 09:57.400
that a body without
a circulatory system

09:57.400 --> 09:59.900
isn't necessary?

09:59.900 --> 10:03.000
-A little more time
and a lot less money.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.500
Now, the government has
a tendency to waste funds,

10:05.500 --> 10:09.300
just to be a little
more flashy, it seems.

10:09.300 --> 10:13.300
-Hmm. Now,

10:13.300 --> 10:16.500
personally, how do you feel
about animal testing,

10:16.500 --> 10:19.300
not as a medical doctor,
but as a human being?

10:22.800 --> 10:25.500
-I've heard people say,
"Since animals can't talk,

10:25.500 --> 10:28.400
that means they cannot reason."

10:28.400 --> 10:30.600
It's not a question of whether
they can talk or reason,

10:30.600 --> 10:34.000
but whether they suffer or not,

10:34.000 --> 10:36.400
and I believe that,
if animals could talk,

10:36.400 --> 10:39.900
they would probably demand
the same ethical considerations

10:39.900 --> 10:42.600
we, as human beings, require.

10:42.600 --> 10:48.600
-Incredible, Doctor.
Incredible. Um.

10:48.600 --> 10:51.000
-I do have a question for you,
though, Mr. Cornish.

10:52.800 --> 10:54.000
-Have you considered going

10:54.000 --> 10:56.700
to the primate sanctuary
there in Arizona?

10:58.500 --> 11:01.300
-Primate sanctuary
in River City, Arizona.

11:01.300 --> 11:02.700
Opened back in the '70s,

11:02.700 --> 11:04.800
originally for
government testing,

11:04.800 --> 11:06.700
but, due to some
concerns raised

11:06.700 --> 11:08.900
by local
animal-rights activists,

11:08.900 --> 11:12.100
purpose of the installation
was changed from test site

11:12.100 --> 11:14.300
to sanctuary, or so they say.

11:14.300 --> 11:17.600
-Yeah, I've -- I haven't heard
anything like this.

11:17.600 --> 11:19.600
This is news to me.

11:19.600 --> 11:22.600
-Well, it wasn't open for long
after the transition.

11:22.600 --> 11:24.100
It seemed they changed
the name,

11:24.100 --> 11:27.400
but not the actions that took
place inside the building.

11:27.400 --> 11:29.400
Shortly after,
funding dropped out,

11:29.400 --> 11:31.100
and, well, to my understanding,

11:31.100 --> 11:35.200
now it stands as about 40 tons
of abandoned concrete.

11:35.200 --> 11:37.300
Are you near River City?

11:37.300 --> 11:41.900
-It's currently about 40 miles
northwest of where I'm sitting.

11:41.900 --> 11:43.700
-Might be something
that interests you,

11:43.700 --> 11:46.800
if you could find
some old employees

11:46.800 --> 11:49.300
or records on the place.

11:49.300 --> 11:51.300
Could prove to be fruitful
to your efforts.

11:51.300 --> 11:55.300
-I really appreciate
this information, Dr. Reeves.

11:55.300 --> 11:56.800
Is there any way

11:56.800 --> 12:00.200
that I can reschedule
an interview with you at all?

12:00.200 --> 12:01.600
-Oh, absolutely.
-All right.

12:01.600 --> 12:04.600
Thanks very much again.

12:04.600 --> 12:06.400
Wow!

12:08.300 --> 12:11.100
-Uh, probably have
Sienna and Scarlett

12:11.100 --> 12:12.900
make some phone calls,
see if we can dig up

12:12.900 --> 12:15.600
any information
about former employees.

12:15.600 --> 12:17.700
If that falls through,
I'll look up some old

12:17.700 --> 12:20.100
newspaper articles online,
see what I can dig up.

12:20.100 --> 12:22.400
-Wait. So what if we
actually go down there,

12:22.400 --> 12:25.900
check out the facility,
record it, and then see like

12:25.900 --> 12:28.200
what kind of environment
the apes were kept in?

12:28.200 --> 12:30.500
-Gunner, you're brilliant. Ah!

12:30.500 --> 12:33.300
-Wait, though. Did he ever
mention when they shut it down?

12:33.300 --> 12:35.600
-Let's just hope
it's still standin'.

12:35.600 --> 12:38.300
-Hey, Scarlett.
What are you doing?

12:38.300 --> 12:40.600
-Well, it says here that
the facility was open

12:40.600 --> 12:43.400
and running by 1981,

12:43.400 --> 12:48.200
but then would be closed
permanently by 1995.

12:48.200 --> 12:49.600
-Click on the image
search over here.

12:49.600 --> 12:52.900
See if there's any recent
photos of the place.

12:52.900 --> 12:54.900
Yep.

12:54.900 --> 12:56.700
-There is, actually.

12:56.700 --> 13:01.200
There's about a handful here,
some as recent as 2 years ago.

13:01.200 --> 13:03.700
-Well, then, as of 2 years ago,
it still stands.

13:03.700 --> 13:05.300
What do you say
we go check it out?

13:05.300 --> 13:07.200
-That's brilliant because
if we check it out,

13:07.200 --> 13:10.600
did you know about how mental
facilities back in 1800s, 1900s,

13:10.600 --> 13:13.700
they found and exposed the cruel
ways they were treating people?

13:13.700 --> 13:15.400
-Mm-hmm.
-They exposed it completely!

13:15.400 --> 13:16.800
Can you imagine, if we went
to that facility,

13:16.800 --> 13:18.900
to-day,
and we exposed

13:18.900 --> 13:21.400
how they're treating animals
and the cruelty that they have?

13:21.400 --> 13:23.000
It'd be great!

13:23.000 --> 13:25.200
-That is so hot.

13:27.100 --> 13:29.400
But, I hate to admit it.

13:29.400 --> 13:30.600
Gunner's right.

13:30.600 --> 13:33.900
I mean, we could blow
the top off of this thing!

13:33.900 --> 13:37.100
To be able to go there
and see what their life was like

13:37.100 --> 13:39.900
when the facility was
still open and operational?

13:39.900 --> 13:41.900
I mean, this is unheard of.

13:41.900 --> 13:46.100
Hello. Wait.
You hate to admit?

13:46.100 --> 13:49.400
-Because, if you're right once,
then you're right more often

13:49.400 --> 13:51.000
-Ha!
-and, trust me,

13:51.000 --> 13:52.800
we cannot have that.

13:52.800 --> 13:55.700
-Okay. Okay.
I hear you loud and clear.

13:55.700 --> 13:57.500
-Nobody who's worked there
is accessible.

13:57.500 --> 13:59.000
No names, no addresses,

13:59.000 --> 14:02.100
so, basically,
everything's wiped off the map.

14:02.100 --> 14:03.500
-Do we have good news,
at least?

14:03.500 --> 14:05.600
-Well, I just got off the phone
with the county recorder

14:05.600 --> 14:07.800
and he mentioned that the
building is still standing

14:07.800 --> 14:10.100
and it's actually
considered an abandonment.

14:10.100 --> 14:11.500
-Guys, this is incredible.

14:11.500 --> 14:13.300
You realize that,
if we go through with this,

14:13.300 --> 14:15.800
we're gonna be something that
nobody's ever done before?

14:15.800 --> 14:18.300
-I always knew you were
something special.

14:21.600 --> 14:23.300
-In a window-licking
sort of way.

14:23.300 --> 14:24.700
-Whoa, cut that. We can't have.

14:24.700 --> 14:26.300
That's not PC.

14:26.300 --> 14:27.700
Fuck PC!

14:27.700 --> 14:29.500
-You kiss your mom
with that mouth?

14:29.500 --> 14:32.100
-I do a lot more than that
with my mouth.

14:32.100 --> 14:33.200
-Ha!

14:33.200 --> 14:34.500
And to think,
she was scolding me

14:34.500 --> 14:36.100
for calling her babe on-camera.

14:36.100 --> 14:38.100
-Yeah.
-I love that girl.

14:38.100 --> 14:40.200
-She's a wild one.
What can I say?

14:40.200 --> 14:42.800
-* A wild one *

14:42.800 --> 14:46.700
All right. We are on our way.
Got this nice, hefty camera bag.

14:46.700 --> 14:49.300
We got two GoPros in here that
we're gonna slap on the girls

14:49.300 --> 14:51.300
and I've got this beast of a rig
that we're gonna film

14:51.300 --> 14:53.700
some beautiful B-roll footage
on. Isn't that right?

14:53.700 --> 14:57.300
-Yep, but, girls, please,
be gentle with my cameras.

14:57.300 --> 14:58.900
Don't break 'em.
-I heard GoPros

14:58.900 --> 15:02.100
are more or less indestructible.

15:02.100 --> 15:03.200
-Yeah. Let's not test that.

15:03.200 --> 15:05.200
Just be gentle
with them, please.

15:05.200 --> 15:07.200
-Can do, Captain.
-Sienna.

15:07.200 --> 15:09.100
-Look at me.

15:09.100 --> 15:10.700
-I am.

15:10.700 --> 15:12.200
I am the captain now.

15:13.900 --> 15:16.600
-I'm not sure I can do this
all day with you two.

15:16.600 --> 15:19.100
-Don't act like it's torture.
You love us.

15:19.100 --> 15:21.000
-Help! I need an adult!

15:21.000 --> 15:23.100
-There are no adults here.

15:23.100 --> 15:25.300
-No kidding.
-Well, we're here.

15:25.300 --> 15:26.800
-Awesome.
-All right, guys.

15:26.800 --> 15:28.900
Let's get the gear
and get goin'.

15:28.900 --> 15:30.100
We got a long day.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.200
-Yo!
-All right.

15:35.200 --> 15:37.600
What we got going on here:
getting our gear ready.

15:37.600 --> 15:39.800
Hello. All right.

15:39.800 --> 15:43.600
Hey, Max. Are you gonna
come with us, man?

15:43.600 --> 15:45.300
-You know, something
about a long-ass hike

15:45.300 --> 15:47.900
just doesn't appeal to me, man.
I don't mind being your wheels.

15:47.900 --> 15:49.900
I'll probably just take
a nap or something.

15:49.900 --> 15:51.900
-All right.
I mean, suit yourself.

15:53.900 --> 15:56.700
Oh, hi.

15:58.100 --> 16:03.100
-Well, that harness definitely
accentuates your breasts.

16:03.100 --> 16:05.100
-Well, yeah.

16:05.100 --> 16:06.500
That's what they're called.

16:06.500 --> 16:09.900
-Maybe in the classroom,
not in real life.

16:09.900 --> 16:12.400
-Well, pardon me.
I'm a gentleman.

16:12.400 --> 16:16.200
-Sienna, please, tell Gunner
that they are not

16:16.200 --> 16:17.400
called breasts,

16:17.400 --> 16:20.100
-unless in the classroom
or in the hospital.

16:20.100 --> 16:20.900
-Oh, this is gonna be good.

16:20.900 --> 16:22.500
-No, she's right!

16:22.500 --> 16:24.500
I mean, tits, boobs,

16:24.500 --> 16:27.100
dirty pillows, hooters,

16:27.100 --> 16:30.200
the girls, but not breasts.

16:30.200 --> 16:33.700
Who knew my girlfriend
was such a pervert?

16:33.700 --> 16:35.000
-You.
-Oh, yeah.

16:38.800 --> 16:42.700
Okay, knockers.
You're right. You win. I get it.

16:42.700 --> 16:43.800
-Don't say knockers.

16:43.800 --> 16:45.900
-That's gross.

16:45.900 --> 16:47.100
-I can't win.

16:50.800 --> 16:54.900
-Oh. Oh, shit! Oh. Oh. Ohh!

16:54.900 --> 16:57.300
Ooh!

16:57.300 --> 17:00.100
A little bit of a --
What'd you say again?

17:00.100 --> 17:01.900
-I said, "How'd you get down
there so quick?"

17:01.900 --> 17:03.900
-Side step like a mountain lion.

17:03.900 --> 17:06.500
-Yeah, or a cow.
-You're a cow.

17:06.500 --> 17:09.200
-Come on.

17:09.200 --> 17:11.200
Hiking is not my bag.

17:11.200 --> 17:14.200
-It's not any of our bags, hon.
-Easy.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.800
-Well, Google Maps said

17:16.800 --> 17:18.800
the regular road is trash.

17:18.800 --> 17:20.099
It's the only straight
shot through,

17:20.099 --> 17:22.599
is following the river here.
-Ugh!

17:22.599 --> 17:24.900
The things we do for love!
-Ha, wait.

17:24.900 --> 17:27.099
Did you just say
you love me on

17:27.099 --> 17:30.000
-I said no such thing.
-Pssh! It was totally
implied, though.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.600
-Girl code!

17:32.600 --> 17:34.200
-Probably.
-Look.

17:34.200 --> 17:36.100
We've got about 3 miles north.

17:36.100 --> 17:38.200
We're gonna come across
an old cement tunnel.

17:38.200 --> 17:39.400
It's gonna be
on our right-hand side.

17:39.400 --> 17:41.500
Once we head through it,
be about another half mile

17:41.500 --> 17:43.700
'til our destination, so let's
not waste any more time.

17:43.700 --> 17:45.100
-Okay.
-You heard him, girls.

17:45.100 --> 17:46.700
-Yeah. Yeah. I'm coming.

17:49.500 --> 17:52.400
-Dude, why are
you filming that?

17:52.400 --> 17:54.700
-Dude, it's a helicopter.
Why wouldn't I?

17:54.700 --> 17:59.200
What's it doing here?
-I'm not sure.

17:59.200 --> 18:02.700
-Save us!
-Stop, Scarlett.

18:02.700 --> 18:04.600
-Real, real mature.

18:04.600 --> 18:07.500
-All right, guys.
We're almost there.

18:07.500 --> 18:10.200
-This is brutal.

18:12.100 --> 18:15.100
-Yeah. I just --
I need some water.

18:15.100 --> 18:17.100
Can we take a break?
-Hey, Ryan. Yeah.

18:17.100 --> 18:18.200
Can we take 5 here, bro?

18:18.200 --> 18:22.200
-That's fine. Here. Heads up.
-Thank you.

18:22.200 --> 18:24.500
-This is so incredible.
-It's just graffiti.

18:24.500 --> 18:26.300
It's not even like
it's that good.

18:26.300 --> 18:29.700
-Please. It's so raw and real
and passionate,

18:29.700 --> 18:32.100
like open
for the world's display.

18:32.100 --> 18:34.800
Select group of artists.

18:34.800 --> 18:37.900
-It's actually really pretty.

18:37.900 --> 18:39.300
Girls have a thing for this.

18:39.300 --> 18:41.900
-Ryan, we'll never understand.
We're just troglodytes

18:41.900 --> 18:43.600
in their eyes.

18:48.700 --> 18:50.900
-Hey, you guys be careful
down there. All right?

18:50.900 --> 18:53.200
-Whatever.
-Yeah. I'm not your --

18:53.200 --> 18:54.800
-I'm a professional, Gunner.
I do this every day.

18:54.800 --> 18:57.100
-Yeah. I'm not your mom,
but okay. Yeah, sure.

18:57.100 --> 18:59.300
-Like this.

19:03.100 --> 19:06.200
-Yeah. I'll be fine.

19:06.200 --> 19:07.900
-I think so.

19:07.900 --> 19:10.300
-We can take like a 30-minute
break here if you want.

19:10.300 --> 19:11.300
I mean, that's not a problem.

19:11.300 --> 19:12.400
-Yeah, maybe.

19:12.400 --> 19:14.800
Sid we bring lunch?

19:14.800 --> 19:16.800
-I hope somebody did.
-Okay.

19:16.800 --> 19:19.400
Yeah. Let me ask Ryan
about that, okay?

19:19.400 --> 19:22.000
Hey, Ryan. Did we remember
to bring lunch?

19:22.000 --> 19:23.700
-Bless you.

19:23.700 --> 19:26.100
-Thank you.
-Oh, no.

19:26.100 --> 19:29.200
-Oh, you're a dumbass.

19:29.200 --> 19:30.600
Yeah, skip your rocks --

19:30.600 --> 19:33.100
Huh-huh huh-huh
huh -- while we go hungry.

19:35.000 --> 19:41.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

19:45.900 --> 19:47.900
-Oh, shit.

19:47.900 --> 19:49.800
Did I leave the cooler?
-Oh.

19:49.800 --> 19:51.200
Wait, Scarlett.
Do you have my bag?

19:51.200 --> 19:52.800
-I don't have your bag.

19:52.800 --> 19:55.300
-Hey. Did anybody forget
the camera?

19:55.300 --> 19:57.600
-They're probably
at the tunnel.

19:57.600 --> 19:58.800
-We can just go back.

19:58.800 --> 20:00.400
-All right.
-Yay!

20:00.400 --> 20:01.600
-Let's talk about
something more important.

20:01.600 --> 20:03.900
Look at this, guys.

20:03.900 --> 20:06.200
-I take it this
is the entrance.

20:06.200 --> 20:09.100
-Yeah. It looks like someone
was in too much of a hurry

20:09.100 --> 20:11.100
to open the gate
the last time they left.

20:11.100 --> 20:13.200
-Oh, no. No. No.
Don't say that.

20:13.200 --> 20:15.000
Gave me the creeps
so bad right now.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.100
-Let's go ahead and check out
this small building over here,

20:17.100 --> 20:18.300
-Yeah, might as well.
-get footage.

20:18.300 --> 20:19.400
Couldn't hurt.

20:19.400 --> 20:21.300
-Get out of the sun.

20:21.300 --> 20:22.800
-And the grass.

20:22.800 --> 20:24.400
-Watch out for snakes,
you guys.

20:24.400 --> 20:25.600
-Now you got a camera.

20:30.800 --> 20:32.200
-"Garage."

20:32.200 --> 20:33.800
-This was definitely
a facility.

20:36.300 --> 20:38.700
-Oh, my god.

20:38.700 --> 20:40.500
-Whew!

20:40.500 --> 20:42.600
-I don't know. That's bad!

20:42.600 --> 20:44.000
Mm.
-Oh!

20:46.300 --> 20:49.400
-Oh.
-Something is definitely dead.

20:49.400 --> 20:51.500
-Smells like Ryan's
downstairs mixup.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.100
-* I've got a mangina *

20:53.100 --> 20:55.600
-Ah, crap.

20:55.600 --> 20:57.000
-Let's check this out, you guys.
-Oh, now we're a joke.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.300
-Careful. Watch your step.
-Okay.

20:58.300 --> 21:03.300
-There's tons of glass.
-Place is definitely secure.

21:05.400 --> 21:06.600
Wow!

21:08.800 --> 21:09.800
-Watch your step, guys.

21:09.800 --> 21:11.200
I don't want anybody
to get tetanus.

21:11.200 --> 21:13.100
-I don't even know what to say.

21:13.100 --> 21:14.300
Oh.

21:14.300 --> 21:16.600
-So much glass.

21:16.600 --> 21:19.000
-Ryan, does that look
entirely safe, man?

21:19.000 --> 21:22.400
Probably not.
There's a whole step missing.

21:23.500 --> 21:25.900
-Dude, Ryan.
-Whoa! Oh!

21:25.900 --> 21:27.400
-Careful, man.

21:27.400 --> 21:30.200
Definitely not safe.
-Yeah.

21:36.700 --> 21:38.300
Looks like we've still
got a ways to go.

22:09.100 --> 22:12.100
-All right.
Guys, we are actually in

22:12.100 --> 22:15.800
one of the main buildings
of the monkey farm facility.

22:15.800 --> 22:18.500
It's rather old
and it really doesn't look

22:18.500 --> 22:21.200
anything like
its former self, but,

22:21.200 --> 22:26.800
doesn't seem like there's
anything too interesting.

22:26.800 --> 22:30.300
-Place is a dump.
-Yeah. It's so gross.

22:30.300 --> 22:32.900
-Well, I say interesting.
Well, that's interesting.

22:36.500 --> 22:39.500
Ryan, is there anything
up there, anything at all?

22:39.500 --> 22:42.700
-Plywood and medical equipment.
There's not too much.

22:42.700 --> 22:44.200
It's not really worth our time.

22:44.200 --> 22:45.800
No?
-No.

22:45.800 --> 22:47.600
I'm thinking we should
just head back down.

22:47.600 --> 22:49.400
-Oh, okay.

22:49.400 --> 22:52.100
-Well, you can tell it was
pretty nice at one point.

22:54.500 --> 22:57.100
-Must've been some facility
back in the day.

22:57.100 --> 22:59.500
-Ugh.
-I know. I just didn't wanna

22:59.500 --> 23:01.900
touch anything.

23:01.900 --> 23:05.600
-Place sure could use some TLC,
if you know what I mean.

23:05.600 --> 23:09.500
-Yeah. You know me.

23:09.500 --> 23:11.400
-All right.

23:11.400 --> 23:12.900
Let's check somewhere over here.

23:23.800 --> 23:24.900
-I mean, I would not wanna

23:24.900 --> 23:26.500
-Funny.
-sit on that.

23:26.500 --> 23:28.800
-Do you guys prefer
to watch, or not?

23:28.800 --> 23:30.400
I don't think I have a choice.
-I don't know.

23:30.400 --> 23:33.100
You know, voyeurism's
not really been my thing.

23:33.100 --> 23:34.700
-How do you guys have
to use the bathroom?

23:34.700 --> 23:37.000
We don't even have water!

23:37.000 --> 23:38.900
-Good point.
-There are some sinks

23:38.900 --> 23:39.900
-Very good point.
-up here, though.

23:39.900 --> 23:41.200
-Some urinals on the ground.

23:41.200 --> 23:42.800
Look at these
tiny little urinals.

23:42.800 --> 23:45.200
-I doubt it.
Is there any water running?

23:45.200 --> 23:47.300
-Check. Yeah. Check the sink.

23:47.300 --> 23:48.500
-Gross.
-Good idea.

23:48.500 --> 23:50.200
-Sienna.

23:50.200 --> 23:51.400
-Ugh!

23:51.400 --> 23:53.600
-Nasty.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.800
-We're all friends.
-It doesn't.

23:55.800 --> 23:58.100
-It didn't even move.
-No. Didn't even move.

24:00.600 --> 24:03.500
-I feel the creepy crawlies
on me right now.

24:03.500 --> 24:04.900
-Don't say that.
-No, I'm saying it.

24:04.900 --> 24:06.700
-Ohhh!
-Check out this hole.

24:06.700 --> 24:08.500
Where does this lead to?
-Ooh.

24:08.500 --> 24:10.500
Let's put the camera up there.
-Oh.

24:10.500 --> 24:12.000
No. That's not really
worth our time.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.200
Here I was thinking there was
gonna be some shaft.

24:13.200 --> 24:14.300
-No. I can totally --

24:14.300 --> 24:16.300
We can get Sienna
down there, right?

24:16.300 --> 24:18.100
No.
-You would totally fit.

24:18.100 --> 24:19.200
-Yeah.
You can get down there, right?

24:19.200 --> 24:21.100
-Oh! No.
-Oh, come on! Come on!

24:21.100 --> 24:23.500
-There could be
some crucial evidence.
-No!

24:23.500 --> 24:24.800
-Come on. Lookit.

24:24.800 --> 24:26.500
It's a tunnel that could lead
to your wildest dreams.

24:26.500 --> 24:28.400
-You guys are crazy.
-Okay.

24:28.400 --> 24:30.700
It was worth a shot, right?

24:30.700 --> 24:35.300
-I'm starting to question
what I see in you, Gunner.

24:35.300 --> 24:38.000
-That's me, every day.

24:39.900 --> 24:43.200
-All right. I suppose let's move
on to the next building.

24:43.200 --> 24:44.100
-All right.

24:44.100 --> 24:45.500
Where to, El Capitn?

24:49.700 --> 24:52.600
Hello! Anybody here?

24:52.600 --> 24:54.900
Hello!
-Okay.

24:54.900 --> 24:56.500
So I just had
the stark realization

24:56.500 --> 24:59.100
that someone else
might actually be here

24:59.100 --> 25:00.500
and I'm feeling really
uncomfortable right now.

25:00.500 --> 25:01.800
-Hey. Hey. There's no way.

25:01.800 --> 25:05.000
This is such a remote location.
It's not possible.

25:05.000 --> 25:08.500
-Hey. I'll protect you.

25:08.500 --> 25:12.400
-Aw. Thanks, Gunny.

25:12.400 --> 25:15.200
-Yeah. It's a combination
of Gunner and honey.

25:15.200 --> 25:18.900
-Uh, yeah. Sorry. Let's go.

25:26.100 --> 25:28.100
This place was
probably pretty once.

25:28.100 --> 25:30.100
-I told you so.

25:30.100 --> 25:33.200
-Guys, this doesn't look
like a test facility.

25:33.200 --> 25:34.900
-Maybe these were
living quarters

25:34.900 --> 25:36.800
for the staff
who worked onsite.

25:36.800 --> 25:39.200
-Aah!
-Oh! Ryan!

25:39.200 --> 25:41.300
-Goddamn it, Ryan!
-You little shit!

25:41.300 --> 25:42.600
-You almost gave me
a heart attack!

25:42.600 --> 25:44.200
-You scared the hell out of me!

25:44.200 --> 25:45.800
-Sorry, babe.
-Oh, my god.

25:45.800 --> 25:48.100
-I'm not really sure what
this building was

25:48.100 --> 25:50.400
and it looks like it
could've been a set of dorms,

25:50.400 --> 25:55.100
but to be honest,
it looks like a huge bathroom.

25:55.100 --> 25:57.100
-Great.

25:57.100 --> 25:58.500
-Hopefully,
this was a bathroom once

25:58.500 --> 26:00.300
'cause you literally did
scare the piss out of me.

26:02.100 --> 26:03.500
-What I don't get is

26:03.500 --> 26:05.600
why does everything have
to stink around here?

26:05.600 --> 26:07.300
-Do you wanna see this room
and check it out?

26:07.300 --> 26:09.500
-Tell me about it.
-Or this one. Hello.

26:09.500 --> 26:12.800
-Guys, this place makes me
really uncomfortable.

26:12.800 --> 26:14.300
-Wow.

26:14.300 --> 26:16.800
-Oh! And that's probably
why the door is closed.

26:16.800 --> 26:19.200
-Unlucky 13.

26:19.200 --> 26:20.700
13.
-Don't go in there!

26:20.700 --> 26:22.400
-Yeah, dude! Ah!
-There's a bird.

26:22.400 --> 26:24.800
-I am not. No. I can't.
-Bad juju. Bad juju.

26:24.800 --> 26:26.100
-Oh. There is a bird.
-Nope.

26:26.100 --> 26:27.200
-So that's what's behind

26:27.200 --> 26:29.400
door number 13!
-door 13!

26:29.400 --> 26:31.600
Mua ha ha ha ha ha ha!

26:31.600 --> 26:33.500
But seriously, let's keep going.
-Assholes.

26:36.500 --> 26:39.100
That room's dark.
-Yeah, seriously.

26:40.600 --> 26:42.100
-You know,
I'm your older brother,

26:42.100 --> 26:43.400
but I hate that
you're taller than me.

26:45.400 --> 26:47.300
You'll get over it.
-That is a really nice couch.

26:47.300 --> 26:48.700
-Oh, my gosh! It is.

26:48.700 --> 26:50.200
-For that condition of a room.
-Wow.

26:50.200 --> 26:52.400
-Let me check it out.
-It's pretty.

26:52.400 --> 26:54.200
-I got the fancy camera,
after all.

26:54.200 --> 26:57.500
Oh, shit! This is comfy!

26:57.500 --> 26:59.100
Ryan, come on!
-Don't sit on there.

26:59.100 --> 27:00.800
-Prop yourself up
on this bad boy.

27:00.800 --> 27:03.600
-You suppose they were
outta here in a hurry?

27:03.600 --> 27:07.300
-It looks like they just
literally picked up and left.

27:07.300 --> 27:10.900
-Yeah. It's the unsettling part
about this whole thing, is --

27:10.900 --> 27:13.300
Did you hear that?

27:13.300 --> 27:16.200
Okay. Let's go back
to the girls. I'm not. I'm not.

27:16.200 --> 27:19.200
-Yeah.
-No. Nope.

27:21.900 --> 27:23.800
Yeah.
-Hello!

27:23.800 --> 27:25.200
-Oh, gross!
-Guys, seriously,

27:25.200 --> 27:26.600
try not to get too far ahead

27:26.600 --> 27:28.900
'cause we don't know
what's out here.

27:28.900 --> 27:31.300
-Okay. Good point.
-Here.

27:31.300 --> 27:34.200
-Yeah. I don't want you to get
attacked by the rabid pigeon.

27:34.200 --> 27:36.600
-Ohhh!
-I mean, there's mold and...

27:36.600 --> 27:39.000
I mean, this place
hasn't been used for years.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.400
-Don't mind me.

27:41.400 --> 27:42.400
-Ugh!

27:42.400 --> 27:43.800
It's just like
a place out of --

27:43.800 --> 27:45.700
No, don't open the door.
We don't know what's behind it.

27:45.700 --> 27:47.500
-If I can make it out of this
place without spores

27:47.500 --> 27:49.300
in my lungs,
I'll be a happy camper.

27:49.300 --> 27:51.600
-Ryan.

27:51.600 --> 27:52.400
-Yeah.
-Open the door.

27:52.400 --> 27:54.500
-I have asthma!

27:54.500 --> 27:55.900
-Don't breathe.
-I didn't say kick it.

27:55.900 --> 27:58.200
I said open it.
-Don't breathe.

27:58.200 --> 27:59.400
-Whoa!

28:02.100 --> 28:03.300
-Oh, that smells like a --

28:03.300 --> 28:04.900
Ugh!

28:04.900 --> 28:08.100
-Not gonna choke this time.
Ahem.

28:08.100 --> 28:09.900
-Mnh!

28:09.900 --> 28:11.900
Is there --
Do you guys notice, too?

28:11.900 --> 28:14.600
It doesn't look like this place
has just been run down.

28:14.600 --> 28:16.600
It looks like some of it's
been broken into,

28:16.600 --> 28:18.100
beaten up, destroyed.

28:18.100 --> 28:22.300
Like something came through
and just wrecked everything.

28:22.300 --> 28:24.100
-Yeah.
-Ugh.

28:24.100 --> 28:25.900
-But then there's dust.

28:25.900 --> 28:28.100
-Oh, look.
There's more rooms down here.

28:29.700 --> 28:30.800
-The one beauty
of the building.

28:30.800 --> 28:33.700
!

28:33.700 --> 28:35.600
-Maybe we can find
an administrative building

28:35.600 --> 28:37.700
around here somewhere,
that might have some documents.

28:37.700 --> 28:38.900
-Yeah.
-Maybe there's some water.

28:38.900 --> 28:40.500
-This looks like hobos
are camping out in here.

28:44.200 --> 28:46.700
-Yeah. This --
-Oo-oo-ooh!

28:46.700 --> 28:48.100
-So this is definitely where
-Ahem.

28:48.100 --> 28:49.200
-it looks like
someone actually lived.

28:49.200 --> 28:52.300
-Scarlett, look,
there's a couch.

28:52.300 --> 28:54.900
-I just got chills sent
down my spine.
-Oh, yeah.

28:56.100 --> 28:57.800
-Ryan, what did I say
about kicking doors?

28:57.800 --> 29:00.900
-Oh, the upholstery
on this is magnificent.

29:00.900 --> 29:04.500
That's a nice
lamp! I like that lamp!

29:04.500 --> 29:07.700
-That's a nice lamp.

29:07.700 --> 29:09.300
-Ohhh.

29:09.300 --> 29:11.300
-My defense mechanism,
you know.

29:11.300 --> 29:12.900
It's how I'm coping with this.

29:12.900 --> 29:15.000
-Careful. There's glass still.

29:15.000 --> 29:19.100
-Fear is in the eye
of the beholder, or laughter.

29:19.100 --> 29:20.700
-All right. Well, that's
enough messing around.

29:20.700 --> 29:22.400
-Okay.
-Let's look for some evidence

29:22.400 --> 29:23.700
or something.
-Yeah.

29:23.700 --> 29:26.900
-Maybe an administrative
building or...

29:26.900 --> 29:29.300
a file cabinet or something.

29:29.300 --> 29:30.800
I mean, there's gotta be
something around here.

29:30.800 --> 29:33.600
-I did see a couple of filing
cabinets down the hallway.

29:33.600 --> 29:35.100
-All right.
-It's worth looking at.

29:35.100 --> 29:38.900
-Yeah. Let's check 'em.

29:38.900 --> 29:41.100
-No. This place
has crazy fire damage.

29:41.100 --> 29:43.100
I don't see the point
in bringing everyone in here.

29:43.100 --> 29:45.100
-It might have
something that we need.

29:45.100 --> 29:46.400
-I don't know.

29:46.400 --> 29:50.800
It looks just like
the last building we were at.

29:52.300 --> 29:55.700
You two stay here, and Gunner
and I will go check it out.

29:55.700 --> 29:58.500
We'll meet right back here
in 5 minutes.

29:58.500 --> 30:01.400
-Whatever you wanna do, babe.
-It'll just be a minute.

30:01.400 --> 30:04.300
All right?
-Okay.

30:04.300 --> 30:06.500
-Uh-huh. Bye.

30:06.500 --> 30:09.000
Bye-ye!

30:09.000 --> 30:10.400
-Stay safe, you two.

30:10.400 --> 30:12.100
-Have fun!

30:12.100 --> 30:13.800
-Be careful.

30:13.800 --> 30:15.200
-At least she got
a hug goodbye!

30:15.200 --> 30:16.800
-Ha!

30:16.800 --> 30:19.700
Yeah. Like that matters.

30:19.700 --> 30:23.000
So, you know, it kind of looks
like Sienna was right.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.700
It's the exact same layout.

30:25.700 --> 30:28.800
-Yeah. I really hate to say it,

30:28.800 --> 30:31.500
but I think
this place is a bust, too.

30:31.500 --> 30:34.500
I mean, with all of the smoke
and fire damage in here,

30:34.500 --> 30:35.900
I'm pretty sure
it's safe to say,

30:35.900 --> 30:39.300
if there was any damning
evidence, it's all gone, by now.

30:39.300 --> 30:43.900
-So, that said,
what's the plan now?

30:43.900 --> 30:45.500
-I don't know.

30:45.500 --> 30:48.200
I mean, I suppose we could
stay here and keep exploring.

30:48.200 --> 30:50.900
There's one more building on the
other side of the property,

30:50.900 --> 30:52.700
but, it didn't look
really promising.

30:52.700 --> 30:53.800
-Well, I mean,
since we're here,

30:53.800 --> 30:55.300
we might as well give it a go.
I mean,

30:55.300 --> 30:56.300
-You're right.
-just check it out.

30:56.300 --> 30:58.000
-Yeah.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.500
-Oh! On that note, though,

31:00.500 --> 31:02.300
do I get to tell Sienna
she was right,

31:02.300 --> 31:05.300
or do you do that, on

31:05.300 --> 31:08.900
-Look, we'll just tell her that
the fire damage was too much

31:08.900 --> 31:10.800
and we couldn't make it
all the way through.

31:10.800 --> 31:13.100
You're such a bullshit artist.

31:15.400 --> 31:17.500
-I didn't notice this place
when we came in.

31:17.500 --> 31:18.600
-Yeah, I caught a glimpse of it

31:18.600 --> 31:20.300
as we were leaving
the first building.

31:20.300 --> 31:22.100
The roof is what caught my eye.

31:22.100 --> 31:25.400
-Yeah. It doesn't look like
it's in very good condition.

31:25.400 --> 31:28.200
Can't we just peek through
the door and call it good?

31:28.200 --> 31:30.900
-Yeah, probably. It doesn't
look like a very big building.

31:35.600 --> 31:37.700
-A bunch of paperwork.

31:37.700 --> 31:41.200
Paper, everywhere.

31:45.500 --> 31:47.400
-What makes you so happy
about all this?

31:47.400 --> 31:49.700
-This is clearly one of the
rooms they did testing in.

31:49.700 --> 31:52.100
This paperwork might have
something to do with that.

31:52.100 --> 31:53.300
-All right.
-All right, well, let's --

31:53.300 --> 31:54.600
-Let's get started.
-Yeah.

31:54.600 --> 31:58.100
Let's put it together,
see what we can find.

31:58.100 --> 31:59.800
-Here's your beginning slot.

32:03.400 --> 32:05.400
-It's everywhere.
It's absolutely everywhere.

32:05.400 --> 32:07.100
-Well, I have a folder,
so we can just put it in this.

32:07.100 --> 32:10.100
-Okay. Here, grab some of these.
-So much reading.

32:10.100 --> 32:12.900
-We'll fix it up later.
Pick it all up.

32:12.900 --> 32:14.200
-Uh, yeah.

32:14.200 --> 32:15.500
The camera's on, man.
-All right.

32:15.500 --> 32:19.100
-Okay, so apparently,
there was a primate subject here

32:19.100 --> 32:24.700
filed as 19113191514,
otherwise known as Samson?

32:24.700 --> 32:27.500
-Okay, well, we knew this was
a test facility for apes,

32:27.500 --> 32:29.100
so, what's the big deal?

32:29.100 --> 32:30.800
-Hold on, Gunner.
We're getting to that.

32:30.800 --> 32:32.400
Go ahead, Scarlett.
-Ahem.

32:32.400 --> 32:36.300
Well, here, they describe
Samson as a chimpanzee

32:36.300 --> 32:39.300
which would be the largest
ever on record,

32:39.300 --> 32:43.700
at almost 6'0" tall and with
a weight of over 200 pounds.

32:43.700 --> 32:45.800
-Wow!
-Samson was found

32:45.800 --> 32:48.400
in a community of chimpanzees
which were found

32:48.400 --> 32:51.100
on Douglas Peak, which is a part
of the Tabletop Mountain

32:51.100 --> 32:54.100
in South Africa,
which was roughly 33 miles away

32:54.100 --> 32:57.900
from the Koeberg
Nuclear Power Station.

32:57.900 --> 33:03.100
-Samson was extracted from the
group due to his immense size,

33:03.100 --> 33:04.600
which they initially believed

33:04.600 --> 33:07.100
had some correlation
to the community

33:07.100 --> 33:10.400
being so close
to a nuclear power facility.

33:10.400 --> 33:12.400
-Chimps aren't native
to that area, though.

33:12.400 --> 33:14.300
I mean, you know that.
I mean, baboons,

33:14.300 --> 33:17.400
up into the early '90s,
but never any chimps.

33:17.400 --> 33:20.400
-Well, do we have any idea what
would've made 'em migrate?

33:20.400 --> 33:21.900
-I don't know,
but they couldn't have migrated

33:21.900 --> 33:23.800
almost 3,000 miles.
It's impossible.

33:23.800 --> 33:25.100
-That's a good point.

33:25.100 --> 33:27.200
-Well, it could have
something to do

33:27.200 --> 33:32.100
with the simian
immunodeficiency virus outbreak.

33:32.100 --> 33:34.100
It could've happened
on a very large,

33:34.100 --> 33:36.600
undocumented scale,
which would have caused them

33:36.600 --> 33:38.500
to migrate further south
than normal.

33:38.500 --> 33:40.200
-Wait. Wait. Wait.
It says here that Samson

33:40.200 --> 33:41.600
displayed a greater
cognitive thought

33:41.600 --> 33:42.900
than other chimps on record

33:42.900 --> 33:45.500
and he quickly began to groom
himself after the humans

33:45.500 --> 33:47.600
who surrounded him
on the property,

33:47.600 --> 33:50.600
even to the point of modesty,
of wearing human clothes.

33:50.600 --> 33:52.500
So, next,

33:52.500 --> 33:55.300
you're gonna say
he learned to speak English.

33:55.300 --> 33:58.700
-No. No. Actually, while he
apparently became very human

33:58.700 --> 34:02.300
in his behavioral patterns,
he never actually spoke English,

34:02.300 --> 34:04.600
but did learn some version
of sign language.

34:04.600 --> 34:07.100
-Well, that's it.

34:07.100 --> 34:08.699
There is nothing else.

34:08.699 --> 34:11.600
All of this here, it's all
with Samson's name on it,

34:11.600 --> 34:14.900
like he was the only animal
in this entire facility.

34:14.900 --> 34:17.500
-So, you're saying
this entire facility,

34:17.500 --> 34:21.699
this single facility,
was for a single ape.

34:21.699 --> 34:23.500
-It certainly seems that way.

34:32.600 --> 34:34.400
-Yeah.

34:34.400 --> 34:36.300
-But that's none
of our business.

34:36.300 --> 34:39.100
-You know, a mysterious
amount of paperwork, an ape.

34:39.100 --> 34:40.800
I feel like the gears
could be switching

34:40.800 --> 34:43.600
and turning into something else
on this project, direction.

34:43.600 --> 34:45.400
-Well, you have

34:45.400 --> 34:48.199
this deserted facility,
an enigmatic ape running around.

34:48.199 --> 34:50.600
I mean, this could turn
into something much bigger

34:50.600 --> 34:52.500
than we ever anticipated.

34:52.500 --> 34:55.199
-Well, we can't forget
the bigger story here.

34:55.199 --> 34:57.800
I mean, we're the voice of the
voiceless in this documentary.

34:57.800 --> 35:00.800
I mean, it may be interesting,
but we can't lose track.

35:00.800 --> 35:04.100
-We really don't wanna end up
too far down the rabbit hole.

35:04.100 --> 35:06.600
-As alluring as all of this is,
I think it's best if we stay

35:06.600 --> 35:08.300
with the project at hand,

35:08.300 --> 35:10.200
-finish this up,
and maybe come back

35:10.200 --> 35:11.800
to this monkey farm
in a few months or so.

35:11.800 --> 35:13.600
-I think you're fucking crazy.

35:13.600 --> 35:16.400
I mean, we've got this facility
and this Samson ape.

35:16.400 --> 35:18.400
It raises so many questions
and it's like

35:18.400 --> 35:22.500
you guys just wanna blow it off,
like it can't be a part of this.

35:22.500 --> 35:24.300
-Honestly, I think you're
trying to make this

35:24.300 --> 35:26.800
into one of those
horror documentaries

35:26.800 --> 35:28.600
that you're always trying
to make me watch.

35:28.600 --> 35:31.100
-No. That's not the point.
This is just --

35:31.100 --> 35:32.700
could be so much bigger.

35:32.700 --> 35:36.000
-Gunner, you're being a dick,
all right?

35:36.000 --> 35:41.500
-Well, if that's the case,
where do we go from here?

35:41.500 --> 35:44.600
-You guys talking about Samson,
the monkey farm?

35:52.700 --> 35:54.800
-Uh, now's good.

35:54.800 --> 35:58.000
-All right. My name's Jimmy.
This is my boyfriend, Beckett.

35:58.000 --> 35:59.800
We've been at monkey farm
a couple times.

35:59.800 --> 36:01.000
Trust me, you don't
wanna go there.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.600
We've been around the area.
Place is creepy.

36:03.600 --> 36:05.800
-We just came from there.
Didn't seem that bad.

36:05.800 --> 36:07.600
-Consider yourself lucky.

36:07.600 --> 36:10.000
-It's a huge place

36:10.000 --> 36:11.700
and, at night, it just --
it changes.

36:11.700 --> 36:13.700
It's like a giant maze.

36:13.700 --> 36:16.200
-Yeah, it is a large campus.

36:16.200 --> 36:17.300
I feel like,
when we were there,

36:17.300 --> 36:19.100
we got turned around
a couple of times.

36:19.100 --> 36:21.300
-Yeah.
-No, you don't understand.

36:21.300 --> 36:23.600
It has a mind of its own
at night. It changes.

36:23.600 --> 36:25.800
It's...kinda like "The Shining."

36:25.800 --> 36:27.800
-Okay. It's a big,
abandoned building.

36:27.800 --> 36:29.100
I'm sure a lot
of people would say

36:29.100 --> 36:31.900
it's like "The Shining."
Right, guys?

36:31.900 --> 36:33.500
Right

36:33.500 --> 36:34.800
-I've never seen "The Shining."

36:37.200 --> 36:38.900
-He's never seen "The Shining."
-And it's me. I just forgot --

36:38.900 --> 36:40.500
-Never seen "The Shining."

36:40.500 --> 36:43.300
-So do you know
who owns the property?

36:43.300 --> 36:47.400
-Some caretaker, something
like that, or what was it?

36:47.400 --> 36:48.600
-It was a caretaker.
-A caretaker.

36:48.600 --> 36:50.700
-Yeah, a caretaker.

36:50.700 --> 36:52.100
-Yeah.

36:52.100 --> 36:53.500
-No.
We didn't see no caretaker.

36:53.500 --> 36:55.100
-Yeah.
-No, you don't understand.

36:55.100 --> 36:57.300
He's insane.
If he finds you on the property,

36:57.300 --> 36:59.400
he'll shoo you off
by shooting a gun at you.

36:59.400 --> 37:01.200
Last time that happened,

37:01.200 --> 37:03.300
I freaked out
and I haven't been back since.

37:03.300 --> 37:04.700
-What about you, Jimmy,
have you been back?

37:04.700 --> 37:05.900
-I've only been back once.

37:05.900 --> 37:07.400
Me and my buddy Dave went.

37:07.400 --> 37:09.400
It was completely dark,
pitch-black. It was raining.

37:09.400 --> 37:10.900
There was a shit-ton
of lightning.

37:10.900 --> 37:12.700
Shit was fucking crazy.

37:12.700 --> 37:14.200
So we're out,
just hiding and shit.

37:14.200 --> 37:16.100
We're that fucking scared,
we're just hiding completely,

37:16.100 --> 37:18.500
and the lightning just like
illuminated the fucking field.

37:18.500 --> 37:21.200
It was insane. And then,
when it illuminated the field,

37:21.200 --> 37:23.400
that's when we fucking saw it.

37:23.400 --> 37:26.400
-No, Samson.

37:26.400 --> 37:29.100
-Oh, uh.

37:29.100 --> 37:32.200
So, I mean, with the lightning
illuminating it and everything,

37:32.200 --> 37:35.500
you could just see a silhouette.
How do you know it was Samson?

37:35.500 --> 37:37.700
-You can tell it wasn't
a fucking human.

37:37.700 --> 37:39.400
You can tell it was
fucking something

37:39.400 --> 37:41.200
other than a fucking human,
like a monkey almost.

37:41.200 --> 37:42.500
-It was hairy.
-Yeah.

37:42.500 --> 37:44.400
-Did you report it
to the police at all?

37:44.400 --> 37:45.800
-What the fuck
would the police do?

37:45.800 --> 37:47.200
They'd believe my fucking story?

37:47.200 --> 37:50.100
We're already trespassing
in that fucking field.

37:50.100 --> 37:51.400
-Well, have there any --

37:51.400 --> 37:53.300
Have there been any
other reports about Samson?

37:53.300 --> 37:54.500
Has anyone else seen him?

37:56.100 --> 37:57.700
-I mean, it's urban legend,
for the most part,

37:57.700 --> 38:00.200
but I guarantee
some people have seen it.

38:00.200 --> 38:04.400
-Okay, but do you know
anybody who has?

38:04.400 --> 38:07.100
-I mean, I've heard online
and shit, but, I mean, he's --

38:07.100 --> 38:08.600
We've experienced
some crazy shit, there.

38:08.600 --> 38:12.000
I mean, I believe it was
Samson, hands down.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.500
-There's a Facebook
and a YouTube

38:13.500 --> 38:15.700
dedicated to Samson, actually.

38:15.700 --> 38:18.900
These two really weird guys,
I think they're father and son,

38:18.900 --> 38:20.600
anyways,
they post every few weeks

38:20.600 --> 38:22.100
and it looks like
they're filming on a potato,

38:22.100 --> 38:26.500
but they treat Samson as if he's
a Sasquatch or a Bigfoot.

38:26.500 --> 38:28.400
-I don't -- I don't mean
to correct you, but,

38:28.400 --> 38:31.800
Bigfoot and Sasquatch
are the same thing, so.

38:31.800 --> 38:33.700
-Right. Anyways,
I'm sure they'd love

38:33.700 --> 38:35.100
to talk to you about Samson.

38:35.100 --> 38:38.200
You can get in touch
with them through Facebook.

38:38.200 --> 38:40.400
-Okay. Well, should we,
should we do that, guys?

38:42.000 --> 38:46.100
-Pretty sure Sienna said
it would be in...

38:46.100 --> 38:48.300
this room.

38:48.300 --> 38:50.600
-Oh, man, I'm getting
huge rape vibes.

38:50.600 --> 38:53.400
Does everything to you
have to be rapey?

39:03.800 --> 39:04.900
-Henry.

39:09.700 --> 39:10.800
-Okay.

39:17.500 --> 39:20.000
Okay. All right.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.800
-Go ahead
and introduce yourself.

39:21.800 --> 39:23.200
-I'm Roger Miller.

39:23.200 --> 39:25.400
I am a skunk-ape hunter.

39:25.400 --> 39:28.700
Behind me is my son
and partner, Henry Miller.

39:28.700 --> 39:31.100
He is a skunk-ape expert.

39:31.100 --> 39:33.800
-And what exactly
is a skunk ape?

39:33.800 --> 39:37.100
-A skunk ape, or cabbage man,
as we like to call them,

39:37.100 --> 39:38.400
is a cryptid.

39:38.400 --> 39:44.100
Uh, they inhabit Florida,
North Carolina, Arkansas.

39:44.100 --> 39:47.600
Most of the reports have come
from Florida, though.

39:47.600 --> 39:51.800
-Uh, so you're
a skunk-ape expert --

39:51.800 --> 39:54.900
-Hunter, skunk-ape hunter.

39:54.900 --> 39:56.500
Henry is the expert.

39:56.500 --> 39:59.600
Yes, I've been tracking him in
the southern part of the country

39:59.600 --> 40:01.800
for most of my adult life.

40:01.800 --> 40:03.400
-Do you have anything
to show for it?

40:03.400 --> 40:05.300
-A few things:

40:05.300 --> 40:12.600
hair, casts of footprints,
sad, and some video footage.

40:14.500 --> 40:18.300
-Heh! Sad is skunk-ape dung.

40:18.300 --> 40:20.600
It's a pretty potent fertilizer.

40:20.600 --> 40:23.200
-Um, okay.

40:23.200 --> 40:25.500
You said you had
some video footage.

40:25.500 --> 40:27.600
-I do.
-Uh, did you bring any of that

40:27.600 --> 40:29.400
with you today?
-Yes, I did.

40:35.700 --> 40:38.300
-This is the footage.

40:38.300 --> 40:40.100
-Yes. In fact,
this is the clearest footage

40:40.100 --> 40:41.300
we've ever gotten of him.

40:44.800 --> 40:46.200
There he is.

40:46.200 --> 40:48.200
It was actually
taken locally at a place

40:48.200 --> 40:50.100
the kids call the monkey farm.

40:50.100 --> 40:54.300
-Well, the footage does, indeed,
show a man-sized figure.

40:54.300 --> 40:58.000
It's almost too grainy
to really make out.

40:58.000 --> 41:01.100
-That's because the skunk ape
was in motion.

41:01.100 --> 41:02.800
-Yes, I see that.

41:02.800 --> 41:06.600
-That's why we couldn't make
out any defining features.

41:06.600 --> 41:09.900
-Couldn't you just invest
in better equipment?

41:09.900 --> 41:12.400
-I'm not a movie star.
I'm a hunter.

41:12.400 --> 41:15.600
-Well, yeah, but did you
actually shoot this skunk ape?

41:15.600 --> 41:18.400
-Well, no. By the time I dropped
my camera and grabbed my gun,

41:18.400 --> 41:21.000
he was too far away
to get a proper bead on.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.100
-You said you've spent
most of your adult life

41:23.100 --> 41:24.800
hunting the skunk ape.

41:24.800 --> 41:27.100
Care to explain any further?

41:27.100 --> 41:28.600
-I will tell you this:

41:28.600 --> 41:31.300
I don't know where
that skunk ape sleeps,

41:31.300 --> 41:34.100
but I do know he had
impure relations with my wife

41:34.100 --> 41:35.700
-and, when I find him --

41:35.700 --> 41:38.300
and I will find him --
I will kill that skunk ape.

41:38.300 --> 41:40.200
I'm sorry. I don't follow.

41:40.200 --> 41:42.400
Is that why your son,
Henry, is so...big?

41:42.400 --> 41:44.400
!

41:44.400 --> 41:45.600
-Oh, man, hey.
-Are you hunting

41:45.600 --> 41:47.700
that skunk ape,
you miserable motherfucker?

41:47.700 --> 41:50.500
I oughta jump over that camera
and bash your balls in!

41:50.500 --> 41:51.800
-Get the GoPro.
Let's get outta here.

41:51.800 --> 41:53.200
-Man, we didn't --
We didn't mean to offend you.

41:53.200 --> 41:54.600
We're just curious.
-Go go go go!

41:54.600 --> 41:56.600
I bet if I told you,
if you put your head in fire,

41:56.600 --> 41:59.300
you could see hell, you'd do it!
-It was just a joke, man.

41:59.300 --> 42:02.100
-Fuck you, fairies!

42:02.100 --> 42:05.400
-Okay. Holy shit, this is some
leprechaun shit over here.

42:05.400 --> 42:08.400
-I don't know, man.

42:08.400 --> 42:09.700
-Oh!
-Let's get the hell out of here.

42:09.700 --> 42:12.700
-Oh.

42:12.700 --> 42:14.000
-I just thought we were

42:14.000 --> 42:15.800
on the same page
about this documentary.

42:15.800 --> 42:17.400
I mean, we were supposed
to be telling something

42:17.400 --> 42:18.700
really important to the world,

42:18.700 --> 42:21.100
and now I feel like I'm
on a damn monster hunt.

42:21.100 --> 42:23.900
-I don't see how you don't see
the bigger picture here, Babe.

42:23.900 --> 42:25.200
I really don't.

42:25.200 --> 42:28.900
Samson is the poster child
for animal testing.

42:28.900 --> 42:33.100
I mean, they built an entire
facility around him, and, what,

42:33.100 --> 42:36.800
they just abandoned the entire
project and the facility?

42:36.800 --> 42:38.100
-It's pretty obvious
what happened.

42:38.100 --> 42:42.200
If it's so obvious,
then please, enlighten me.

42:42.200 --> 42:43.800
-Samson died!

42:43.800 --> 42:46.100
There was no more reason
for the facility to be open.

42:46.100 --> 42:47.800
-You heard firsthand accounts

42:47.800 --> 42:49.700
that Samson is still
on the property.

42:49.700 --> 42:51.200
-Oh, my gosh.
Eyewitness accounts

42:51.200 --> 42:54.400
from a skinny stoner
and some hillbilly folk.

42:54.400 --> 42:57.200
Even if Samson was still alive,
what would we do?

42:57.200 --> 42:59.700
-I don't know. Rescue him.

42:59.700 --> 43:02.100
!
We don't even have

43:02.100 --> 43:04.800
the right equipment
for that kinda stuff.

43:04.800 --> 43:06.900
-We'd locate him and,
I don't know,

43:06.900 --> 43:08.900
call the police, something.

43:08.900 --> 43:10.600
-I don't even know why
we're talking about this.

43:10.600 --> 43:13.400
Samson was found
in the '70s or '80s.

43:13.400 --> 43:16.000
Like, he's dead, dude.

43:16.000 --> 43:18.700
-You know that monkeys
can live up to 45 years.

43:18.700 --> 43:20.600
-We're not talking
about a monkey.

43:20.600 --> 43:24.700
We're talking about an ape,
a man-sized ape.

43:24.700 --> 43:27.100
Whatever, Ryan.
I'll go on your monster hunt.

43:27.100 --> 43:29.800
-He's not a monster,
Sienna, he's an animal.

43:29.800 --> 43:32.500
And he may need our help.

43:32.500 --> 43:33.900
I know this makes
you uncomfortable,

43:33.900 --> 43:35.700
but you just gotta see
the bigger picture.

43:39.600 --> 43:42.500
Has that been
on this whole time?

43:42.500 --> 43:45.400
-Goddamn it, Ryan.
-I'm sorry, Sienna.

43:45.400 --> 43:47.000
Come on!

43:47.000 --> 43:48.100
Goddamn it.

43:51.000 --> 43:52.700
-So I think we got
everything covered.

43:52.700 --> 43:54.000
Uh

43:54.000 --> 43:55.400
-Guys, guys, guys.

43:55.400 --> 43:57.600
Okay, shh!
Put the camera down.

43:57.600 --> 44:00.200
-No, we're just out

44:00.200 --> 44:01.900
for an early-morning hike.

44:01.900 --> 44:03.500
-Filming a nature
documentary or something?

44:03.500 --> 44:07.900
-Ha! I wish. Just testing
the camera equipment here.

44:07.900 --> 44:11.400
-Now, uh, you wouldn't be
lying to me, would ya?

44:12.600 --> 44:15.100
-Well, you see,
I got a call about 4 days ago

44:15.100 --> 44:18.000
of a group of young folks,
like yourselves,

44:18.000 --> 44:20.700
trespassing out here
on government property,

44:20.700 --> 44:22.700
might even had a camera on 'em.

44:22.700 --> 44:24.100
-That is a coincidence.

44:24.100 --> 44:26.600
-Let me tell you something,
smartass!

44:26.600 --> 44:28.400
I don't believe in coincidence.

44:28.400 --> 44:30.100
I'm gonna paint a real
clear picture for you.

44:30.100 --> 44:32.600
You can either pay attention
to it or not.

44:32.600 --> 44:35.500
If I see this car,
or any of you out here again,

44:35.500 --> 44:37.900
I'm gonna write you
all a citation for trespassing.

44:37.900 --> 44:40.800
That's $500 each.

44:40.800 --> 44:43.400
-Loud and clear, Deputy...
-Widell.

44:43.400 --> 44:45.400
-Mm.
-Now go on.

44:47.000 --> 44:48.300
-Ohhh.

44:48.300 --> 44:51.400
-Jesus.

44:54.300 --> 44:56.100
-I don't know.
Come up with a Plan B.

44:56.100 --> 44:59.400
-Don't worry. I got us covered.

44:59.400 --> 45:02.400
-Well, he said he didn't
wanna see this vehicle.

45:02.400 --> 45:04.700
He didn't say anything
about the battle van.

45:04.700 --> 45:06.900
The battle van!

45:06.900 --> 45:09.700
-You mean that old U-Haul
that your dad never returned?

45:09.700 --> 45:11.200
-That's the one.

45:12.900 --> 45:14.100
-That's what
we're going in.

45:14.100 --> 45:15.600
-Battle van.
-Battle van!

45:15.600 --> 45:17.100
-So we just start walking now.

45:17.100 --> 45:19.100
-Yeah, same.
-Yeah, we should probably go.

45:19.100 --> 45:21.700
-That was close, guys.
I'm fricking shaking here.

45:23.300 --> 45:24.800
Good thing he didn't
find my weed.

45:24.800 --> 45:26.300
Ah.
-Eh!

45:26.300 --> 45:28.300
Come on!

45:28.300 --> 45:29.700
-Trying to be professional, man.

45:29.700 --> 45:31.400
-I think he's still out there.
-Yeah. He's still out here.

45:31.400 --> 45:32.800
Let's get a move on.
-Yeah. Let's go.

45:41.100 --> 45:43.400
-Henry, we don't need you
to shoot anything.

45:43.400 --> 45:44.700
We just need you
to come out and see

45:44.700 --> 45:47.400
if you can help us track Samson.

45:47.400 --> 45:50.100
Yeah. I know, the chances of us
finding him are slim, but,

45:50.100 --> 45:53.200
you're an expert tracker, right?

45:53.200 --> 45:55.300
Look, I'll pay you.
How does that sound?

45:55.300 --> 45:57.200
-Mm-hmm.

45:57.200 --> 45:59.800
-Samson's probably dead, and
he's offering to pay this guy.

45:59.800 --> 46:02.800
-Mm, I think your boy Ryan's
too busy chasing ghosts.

46:02.800 --> 46:05.900
-Monsters.
-Yeah. That works.

46:05.900 --> 46:10.400
So, when the time comes,
will you need us to pick you up?

46:10.400 --> 46:14.300
All right. All right.
Sounds good.

46:14.300 --> 46:16.900
All right. We're all set up.

46:16.900 --> 46:18.400
Where is Scarlett, anyway?

46:18.400 --> 46:20.100
-Oh, she's working, but she
should be out pretty soon.

46:20.100 --> 46:21.900
And she probably
didn't wanna show up

46:21.900 --> 46:24.500
'cause your haircut
makes you look like a dick.

46:24.500 --> 46:26.900
-Oh, come on, man. I just like
cutting my hair short.

46:26.900 --> 46:28.700
At least I don't look
like a hippie.

46:28.700 --> 46:30.400
-Whatever, Major Payne.

46:32.200 --> 46:34.400
-What do you guys think
about my haircut?

46:34.400 --> 46:36.100
-I don't like it.

46:36.100 --> 46:37.600
Some people like dicks.
-You are what you eat.

46:39.900 --> 46:41.300
-Yo, Ryan!

46:41.300 --> 46:43.200
-Yo!
-Yo, get your ass in here!

46:45.400 --> 46:47.200
-I got a big problem

46:47.200 --> 46:48.600
with last night.

46:48.600 --> 46:50.800
Do you wanna know why?
-Hm.

46:50.800 --> 46:54.700
-You called Henry to help us
in our investigation.

46:54.700 --> 46:58.200
Don't you see anything
wrong with that picture?

46:58.200 --> 47:00.100
Okay.
Let me refresh your memory.

47:00.100 --> 47:03.400
Few weeks ago,
hotel, crazy father,

47:03.400 --> 47:04.500
-Yeah.
-crazy son,

47:04.500 --> 47:06.100
almost fucking
ripped my teeth out.

47:06.100 --> 47:08.100
-Gun, calm down. I know.
I was there.

47:08.100 --> 47:09.500
-Yeah. Yeah. You were there.

47:09.500 --> 47:12.300
So why are you like,
"Yeah, hey, bro, Henry,

47:12.300 --> 47:14.700
let's just hang out
and search for Samson now

47:14.700 --> 47:16.700
'cause I'm
a professional, huh"?

47:16.700 --> 47:18.700
-So things went a little
off the deep end

47:18.700 --> 47:20.100
during the interview.
It doesn't mean

47:20.100 --> 47:23.100
that they're not the closest
experts we can find

47:23.100 --> 47:24.600
on anything regarding this.

47:24.600 --> 47:26.600
I mean, how many people
do you know

47:26.600 --> 47:29.100
go out in the middle
of the fricking desert

47:29.100 --> 47:31.100
and look for giant beasts?

47:31.100 --> 47:32.400
-You're right, crazy people.

47:32.400 --> 47:34.600
And, yeah, part of me thinks
we're fucking crazy

47:34.600 --> 47:36.100
for going on this expedition!

47:36.100 --> 47:38.500
First, it was supposed to be
about animal research.

47:38.500 --> 47:40.200
Now we're off about some ape.

47:40.200 --> 47:42.500
I don't know what's going on
between us, but it's, you know,

47:42.500 --> 47:45.500
I'm going crazy here, and now
you wanna hang out with crazy!

47:45.500 --> 47:49.600
-Calm. down.
Just breathe, all right?

47:49.600 --> 47:51.100
-Okay.

47:51.100 --> 47:52.500
You know, I get it.

47:52.500 --> 47:54.800
If it was just me and you --
If it was just me and you,

47:54.800 --> 47:56.800
I'd be fine, but we've got our
girlfriends involved in this

47:56.800 --> 47:58.800
and we're gonna go out in the
middle of nowhere with Henry.

47:58.800 --> 48:00.900
You wanna see
this video I found?

48:00.900 --> 48:02.700
They're -- they're --
they're normal, right?

48:02.700 --> 48:04.100
Come look at this video.

48:04.100 --> 48:06.200
Look at this.
You ready for this shit?

48:06.200 --> 48:07.700
-Yeah.

48:07.700 --> 48:09.900
-For the last 25 years,

48:09.900 --> 48:13.000
my son Henry and I
have come to this place

48:13.000 --> 48:15.600
to issue a challenge
to the cabbage man

48:15.600 --> 48:17.400
and, for the last 25 years,

48:17.400 --> 48:19.600
that challenge has never
been answered.

48:19.600 --> 48:24.400
-Weah weah aqu aqu no!

48:24.400 --> 48:27.900
Clmate! Clmate! Clmate!

48:27.900 --> 48:31.500
iHora! iQué hora?!
iQué hora!

48:31.500 --> 48:34.300
Clmate! Clmate! Clmate!
-Mm-hmm!

48:34.300 --> 48:36.100
-Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!

48:36.100 --> 48:38.200
-Okay. Look at that face.

48:38.200 --> 48:40.400
That guy's gonna be out with us
in the middle of nowhere.

48:40.400 --> 48:42.300
We got two apes:
basically, this guy

48:42.300 --> 48:44.700
and the ape;
and his fuckin' dad!

48:44.700 --> 48:47.600
Oh, let me guess, his dad's
not coming

48:47.600 --> 48:49.100
-Most definitely not.

48:49.100 --> 48:50.100
-No.
-Tell me.

48:50.100 --> 48:51.500
-Fuck no!
-Okay.

48:51.500 --> 48:54.000
-Dude, you saw how Roger
snapped at the fuck--

48:54.000 --> 48:55.700
at literally nothing!

48:55.700 --> 48:57.100
I'd much rather
have Henry there.

48:57.100 --> 49:01.000
I mean, Henry, he was somewhat
respectful, all right?

49:01.000 --> 49:03.100
You know, sure,
he's a little intimidating,

49:03.100 --> 49:06.100
imposing, whatever. We --
Tsk!

49:06.100 --> 49:08.800
Neither you or I are...

49:08.800 --> 49:10.600
even close to that.

49:10.600 --> 49:12.600
-Okay. Okay. Okay. Here.
-Like --

49:12.600 --> 49:16.500
I'll go along with it for a bit.

49:16.500 --> 49:18.100
He's big. He's burly.

49:18.100 --> 49:21.100
He's got weapons, supposedly,
'cause they hunt these things.

49:21.100 --> 49:24.300
-Roger hunts. He's the expert.
-Okay.

49:24.300 --> 49:26.900
Anyway, he's a big mofo.

49:26.900 --> 49:30.600
Samson is gonna be
presumably a big guy, big ape.

49:30.600 --> 49:32.200
We need somebody big,

49:32.200 --> 49:34.100
somebody to help us
in case shit goes down.

49:34.100 --> 49:35.400
-Now you're starting
to see --

49:35.400 --> 49:39.200
-Yeah, I get it, but,
I don't trust this guy.

49:39.200 --> 49:42.100
It's not a matter
about trust, Gunner.

49:42.100 --> 49:44.100
We're paying him.

49:44.100 --> 49:47.700
We are paying him with mo-ney,
all right?

49:47.700 --> 49:51.100
And when you pay somebody for
a service, you get that service.

49:51.100 --> 49:52.800
And that's what I expect
out of him, you know?

49:52.800 --> 49:54.200
-Okay, Ryan.
-He was professional

49:54.200 --> 49:55.700
over the phone, all right?
-Okay.

49:55.700 --> 49:57.200
He was professional
while we were there.

49:57.200 --> 49:59.100
His dad?
A little off the deep end.

49:59.100 --> 50:00.800
-You don't have to tell me
about professional!

50:00.800 --> 50:02.700
I'm your older fuckin' brother!

50:02.700 --> 50:04.800
Okay? Look. We'll get his help.

50:04.800 --> 50:06.200
We'll go out there,
we're gonna get this done,

50:06.200 --> 50:07.900
and we're gonna be done
with this.

50:07.900 --> 50:09.800
I don't care if we don't find
nothing out there that night.

50:09.800 --> 50:12.300
We're done looking
for this mythical Samson

50:12.300 --> 50:13.500
that supposedly exists.

50:13.500 --> 50:15.300
Is that clear?

50:15.300 --> 50:16.500
-Fine.

50:16.500 --> 50:20.700
-That's...fucking fine.
Whatever.

50:20.700 --> 50:23.400
Just call Scarlett
and find me in the morning.

50:23.400 --> 50:24.800
-Goddamn it, Ryan!

50:29.900 --> 50:31.600
-Do you mind if I set
this camera up on the...?

50:31.600 --> 50:32.900
-No.
-Okay. Thank you.

50:32.900 --> 50:34.200
Pardon my reach.

50:34.200 --> 50:36.300
Okay. Just make sure I got
a good shot here,

50:36.300 --> 50:38.200
and I got...

50:38.200 --> 50:39.800
-Hey, man, you got
a haircut, too?

50:39.800 --> 50:43.800
-Gunner, come on.
-Sorry.

50:43.800 --> 50:45.500
-My name is Ryan Cornish.

50:45.500 --> 50:47.300
This is my brother Gunner.

50:47.300 --> 50:48.800
We spoke on the phone earlier

50:48.800 --> 50:51.100
about the documentary
concerning animal testing.

50:51.100 --> 50:53.800
-Yes, I remember.
How would you like to begin?

50:53.800 --> 50:57.300
-You can start by introducing
yourself to the folks at home.

50:57.300 --> 51:01.800
-My name is Dr. Jasmine Gertz
and I'm a neurologist.

51:01.800 --> 51:05.200
-Honestly, I was expecting
someone a little...

51:05.200 --> 51:07.600
Well,

51:07.600 --> 51:08.700
-Both: yeah.

51:08.700 --> 51:09.900
I get that all the time.

51:09.900 --> 51:12.800
Don't worry.
I'm quite used to it.

51:12.800 --> 51:15.100
-So, I know you're very busy.

51:15.100 --> 51:17.100
I don't wanna take up too much
of your time, so do you mind

51:17.100 --> 51:19.100
if I just jump right in
and ask you some questions?

51:19.100 --> 51:20.200
-By all means.

51:20.200 --> 51:24.100
-Where do you stand
on animal testing?

51:25.400 --> 51:28.900
I'm for animal testing.

51:31.600 --> 51:33.100
-The majority
of medical breakthroughs

51:33.100 --> 51:36.200
that have happened
in the last 100 years

51:36.200 --> 51:40.500
were direct results of animal
research and experimentation.

51:40.500 --> 51:41.800
Insulin, for example,

51:41.800 --> 51:43.600
was discovered
through an experiment

51:43.600 --> 51:46.800
where dogs had
their pancreas removed.

51:46.800 --> 51:50.300
The Anderson Cancer Center
animal research

51:50.300 --> 51:53.700
also associated
the hepatitis B vaccine

51:53.700 --> 51:57.400
with experimentation
on chimpanzees.

51:57.400 --> 51:59.500
Without these experimentations,

51:59.500 --> 52:02.300
thousands, if not millions,
of diabetic patients

52:02.300 --> 52:06.400
and those with hepatitis B would
have been killed every year.

52:06.400 --> 52:09.100
The same facility also stated

52:09.100 --> 52:11.300
that the chimps serve
as humanity's only hope

52:11.300 --> 52:14.100
for finding
a hepatitis C vaccine.

52:14.100 --> 52:19.300
-So, I spoke with your
colleague, Dr. Stewart Bennett?

52:19.300 --> 52:21.400
And he said that
we shouldn't really too much

52:21.400 --> 52:25.700
on animal testing,
as some animals reject,

52:25.700 --> 52:27.600
uh, medicines, like aspirin,

52:27.600 --> 52:30.200
that are very beneficial
to humans.

52:30.200 --> 52:32.200
Uh, do you have anything
to say about that?

52:34.400 --> 52:38.800
My colleagues are mostly fossils
that learned the majority

52:38.800 --> 52:42.700
of their techniques and
treatments from a bygone era.

52:42.700 --> 52:46.400
Animal experimentation is not
only beneficial to humans,

52:46.400 --> 52:48.700
but also to animals.

52:48.700 --> 52:51.200
If the vaccines
were not tested on them,

52:51.200 --> 52:52.500
a lot of them could've died,

52:52.500 --> 52:56.500
from rabies,
infectious hepatitis virus,

52:56.500 --> 53:01.700
anthrax, feline leukemia,
and canine parvovirus.

53:01.700 --> 53:03.800
Remedies for hip dysplasia
and glaucoma

53:03.800 --> 53:08.900
were also discovered
through animal testing.

53:08.900 --> 53:11.100
But the real highlight
is that vivisection

53:11.100 --> 53:13.500
helped keep endangered species,

53:13.500 --> 53:17.900
such as the California condor
and tamarins of Brazil

53:17.900 --> 53:23.300
and the black-footed ferret,
from becoming extinct.

53:23.300 --> 53:27.100
This is why the American
Veterinary Medical Association

53:27.100 --> 53:29.200
endorses animal testing.

53:29.200 --> 53:33.400
-Okay, but, if the AVMA
endorses animal testing,

53:33.400 --> 53:37.100
then why are
so many doctors against it?

53:37.100 --> 53:38.600
-I'll say it like this:

53:38.600 --> 53:41.500
You can't teach an old dog
new tricks.

53:41.500 --> 53:43.900
-Okay. That --
that was great, so, um,

53:43.900 --> 53:46.100
I'm gonna go ahead
and turn this off.

53:46.100 --> 53:48.200
So, off the record,

53:48.200 --> 53:52.100
what do you know
about the monkey farm?

53:52.100 --> 53:55.100
-Yeah.

53:55.100 --> 53:58.700
-I'm a neurologist.
I don't dabble in urban legends.

53:58.700 --> 54:00.500
I have real patients to see.

54:00.500 --> 54:03.100
This interview is over.

54:03.100 --> 54:06.100
-Thank you, Dr. Gertz.

54:06.100 --> 54:07.200
I think we blew it.

54:10.200 --> 54:11.500
-Hey, we're good to go.

54:11.500 --> 54:13.100
I've got you connected
to the laptop

54:13.100 --> 54:14.600
and I'm using the girls' phones
-Okay.

54:14.600 --> 54:16.400
-to connect to their GoPros.

54:16.400 --> 54:19.600
-Dude, that's awesome.
-And, of course, my phone,

54:19.600 --> 54:22.200
for anime porn
and fail compilations.

54:22.200 --> 54:24.100
-Uh, okay, I mean,
as long as you just don't get

54:24.100 --> 54:26.300
your guy grease
on everything, please?

54:26.300 --> 54:28.100
-Ah, well, you did say

54:28.100 --> 54:30.400
you were gonna watch porn,
alone!

54:30.400 --> 54:31.800
-I was joking!

54:31.800 --> 54:33.100
Mostly.

54:33.100 --> 54:36.100
-All right, well,
are we good to go?

54:36.100 --> 54:37.100
-We're good.

54:40.200 --> 54:41.700
-All right.

54:41.700 --> 54:43.700
-Listen and listen good.

54:43.700 --> 54:45.600
The last time Pa and I
were here,

54:45.600 --> 54:48.400
we saw Samson
in the medical building.

54:48.400 --> 54:51.300
If you hear anything,
see anything,

54:51.300 --> 54:53.900
hit me up on the walkie-talkies
and I'll come running.

54:53.900 --> 54:57.700
-Henry, we didn't get
a walkie-talkie.

54:57.700 --> 55:00.200
-Hit me up on my cellphone
and I'll come running.

55:00.200 --> 55:01.800
-All right.
-Okay, but what's

55:01.800 --> 55:04.500
that loud sound I'm hearing?

55:04.500 --> 55:08.300
-It only happens at night.

55:08.300 --> 55:09.100
-Okay.

55:11.100 --> 55:15.500
It's like a large,
concrete labyrinth

55:15.500 --> 55:18.200
and Samson is the Minotaur

55:18.200 --> 55:21.600
and he will rip your head off.

55:21.600 --> 55:24.100
If you see anything,
hear anything,

55:24.100 --> 55:26.700
don't freak out
and don't run away.

55:26.700 --> 55:30.100
Excuse me.
-Ma'am.

55:30.100 --> 55:31.700
-Did you bring one
of those guns for us?

55:31.700 --> 55:36.400
-Scarlett.

55:36.400 --> 55:38.200
This place is creepy

55:38.200 --> 55:39.900
and I really don't think
we should be here.

55:39.900 --> 55:42.100
-Look, do you wanna go
back to the van?

55:43.400 --> 55:45.600
-Babe, do you want me
to go with you?

55:45.600 --> 55:47.900
-N-no, no babe,
that-that's fine.

55:47.900 --> 55:50.100
-Yeah. I mean,
we're already out here.

55:50.100 --> 55:52.100
-Yeah, but you're all alone.
-It's fine.

55:52.100 --> 55:54.400
I'll just run back to the van.
I --

55:54.400 --> 55:56.200
I don't wanna slow progress.
-Okay.

55:56.200 --> 55:57.400
-You guys have made it
this far.

55:57.400 --> 56:00.500
Just do what you need to do
and we can leave.

56:00.500 --> 56:02.300
-Okay. Just give me
a kiss, then.

56:02.300 --> 56:03.600
I'll see you.
-Okay. Okay.

56:07.700 --> 56:10.800
-I j-- I just don't think
she can handle it.

56:10.800 --> 56:13.100
-You think everything's
gonna be all right?

56:13.100 --> 56:14.800
-She seemed to be okay
with it, so.

56:14.800 --> 56:16.800
-She's walking back by herself.
-I know. I already feel

56:16.800 --> 56:19.400
bad enough about it, but, maybe
the fresh air will help her.

56:19.400 --> 56:21.200
She's gotta get back.

56:21.200 --> 56:24.100
-All right.
Hold on to this.

56:24.100 --> 56:26.400
I like to hunt in the dark.

56:26.400 --> 56:28.200
You guys go that way.

56:28.200 --> 56:30.300
I'm heading this way.

56:30.300 --> 56:32.300
-All right. We'll hit you up
if we hear anything, Henry.

56:35.900 --> 56:37.500
-She'll be fine.
She's a grownup.

56:37.500 --> 56:39.500
-I'm really worried about her,
but, I mean, this --

56:39.500 --> 56:40.600
We came out here to do thi--

56:54.400 --> 56:57.400
-This place is a whole
lot creepier at night.

56:57.400 --> 56:59.900
-Yeah. She means like

56:59.900 --> 57:02.100
really fuckin' scary now.

57:02.100 --> 57:04.100
-Yeah. I can see that.

57:06.900 --> 57:09.600
So, hypothetical situation here:

57:09.600 --> 57:11.100
if we do find this Samson,

57:11.100 --> 57:14.000
what are we gonna do?

57:14.000 --> 57:15.500
-Call --

57:15.500 --> 57:17.700
-Call Animal Control.
I don't know.

57:17.700 --> 57:20.100
Yeah. I'm trespassing

57:20.100 --> 57:21.200
and I just happened to so find

57:21.200 --> 57:23.300
a 50-year-old chimp.
Can you just come?

57:28.700 --> 57:29.700
Is anyone here?

57:31.600 --> 57:34.500
-Oh.

57:34.500 --> 57:35.500
-Ryan, stop.

57:35.500 --> 57:37.000
What?
-Don't go any further.

57:37.000 --> 57:38.100
-I'm just going --

57:38.100 --> 57:41.700
-I have a really,
a really bad feeling.

57:41.700 --> 57:42.800
-I'll be fine.

57:48.100 --> 57:49.500
I don't see anything.

57:52.800 --> 57:55.200
-Just because you can't
see something

57:55.200 --> 57:57.200
doesn't mean it's not
out there, seeing you.

57:57.200 --> 57:59.300
Well,

57:59.300 --> 58:00.500
I can't really see.

58:00.500 --> 58:01.800
It's too dark.

58:01.800 --> 58:03.300
Does that camera
have night vision on it?

58:03.300 --> 58:04.900
-Okay, yeah, but if you think
I'm stepping in there

58:04.900 --> 58:06.800
by myself...
We didn't come

58:06.800 --> 58:09.500
all this way for nothing,
did we?

58:09.500 --> 58:12.100
-Yes. We did.
-Bullshit, dude.

58:12.100 --> 58:13.700
Look, I'll stand in there

58:13.700 --> 58:15.800
with ya and,
if anything happens,

58:15.800 --> 58:18.200
I can pull ya out and, like
a couple bats out of hell,

58:18.200 --> 58:20.400
we can leave
and never look back.

58:20.400 --> 58:22.500
-You're not leaving until
you're satisfied, huh?

58:22.500 --> 58:24.100
-You know me.
-I hate you,

58:24.100 --> 58:28.200
and I hate this so much
right now, but, okay.

58:28.200 --> 58:30.800
Let me see if I can get
my night vision on.

58:34.700 --> 58:37.600
-Oh, fuck.

58:37.600 --> 58:40.100
-Just a minute.

58:40.100 --> 58:42.100
-I'm only in this hallway
because you said

58:42.100 --> 58:45.500
you'd be by my side, man.

58:45.500 --> 58:47.100
Now I gotta be honest:

58:47.100 --> 58:49.400
I feel like really shitty
that we left Scarlett

58:49.400 --> 58:52.600
and now I gotta be here 150
fuckin' percent for my brother

58:52.600 --> 58:54.300
for this project
that he's obsessed with.

58:56.800 --> 58:58.500
No. Hell, no.

58:58.500 --> 59:00.200
You wanna get this footage,
you do it yourself.

59:00.200 --> 59:03.800
-I'm sorry, Gunner.
I...didn't mean to upset ya.

59:03.800 --> 59:06.300
-No. No, man. I'm done.

59:06.300 --> 59:08.600
-Just get through this
one building with me, please!

59:08.600 --> 59:11.200
Just this one.

59:11.200 --> 59:13.300
-Guys, let's just go.
-I-I'm with Sienna.

59:13.300 --> 59:14.700
Let's just go.
-All right. Whatever, whatever.

59:14.700 --> 59:16.200
Let's just go and get it done.

59:16.200 --> 59:17.900
-All right.

59:27.100 --> 59:28.300
-Let me get my night vision off

59:28.300 --> 59:29.600
'cause it's not helping
that much.

59:29.600 --> 59:33.100
All right.

59:33.100 --> 59:35.200
This place is just --

59:35.200 --> 59:38.200
Okay. Just slow it down, please.
I'm really nervous.

59:38.200 --> 59:40.500
-It smells like dead animals.
-I gotta go in the front

59:40.500 --> 59:42.100
because I got the camera.

59:42.100 --> 59:44.400
I get it, but just bear with me.

59:44.400 --> 59:47.200
-Man, this place is a wreck.
-And you still think

59:47.200 --> 59:49.700
Samson's here?
-I mean, you said it earlier.

59:49.700 --> 59:52.500
This place
is just different at night.

59:52.500 --> 59:54.900
-Oh, jeez.

59:54.900 --> 59:58.100
I don't like it at all.
Scarlett's not here.

59:58.100 --> 59:59.500
I just -- ugh. Okay.

59:59.500 --> 01:00:03.400
-Didn't think I'd be working
with three fraidy-cats.

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:05.700
-Very funny. This is just not
the time to joke, Ryan.

01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:07.300
I know, younger brother and all.

01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:09.700
I'm supposed to be the more
mature one, but come on.

01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:11.200
Just, please, can...?

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:13.700
I don't even wanna be here.
We're on our way out.

01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:15.800
Can you just -- Can you
just be mature, for once?

01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:17.200
-Yeah. Thanks
for humoring me, folks.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.200
Of course, now I'm really
missing Scarlett.

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:27.400
We'll be fine.

01:00:31.900 --> 01:00:32.900
-Uh, uh,

01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:35.400
Who
!

01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:37.100
Who are you?!

01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:38.500
-Uh.
-You're trespassing!

01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:41.100
This is my place!
What's your names?!

01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:42.900
-My name is Ryan Cornish.

01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:45.200
This is my brother Gunner
and my girlfriend, Sienna.

01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:46.400
-Hi.
-We're filmmakers.

01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:48.500
-Yeah. Camera.

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:53.800
!

01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:56.200
-Yes, sir.

01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:59.000
-You think you know
the story of this place?

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.900
You think you know his story?!

01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:02.900
-We were just leaving, sir.
-Yeah.

01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:05.600
-Oh, you no longer
have that right.

01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:11.400
-The right to make your own
decisions, choices,

01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:13.700
rules!

01:01:13.700 --> 01:01:15.600
-I'm sorry. I don't understand.
-Yeah.

01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:20.900
-You don't understand.
Nobody understands!

01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:23.500
We were led to him!

01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:25.100
It was guidance!

01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:30.700
We brought him here!

01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:32.400
We studied him!

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:35.100
At his feet!

01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:37.900
We voted!

01:01:37.900 --> 01:01:42.300
And then, like you,
the protesters came,

01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:44.500
and the Feds!

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:45.800
-I don't know.

01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:47.700
-Everybody wanted to take him.

01:01:47.700 --> 01:01:48.800
-He's got a gun.

01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:56.100
-Suppose you're filming this
for your Facebook.

01:01:56.100 --> 01:01:58.100
-No, just a movie.
-Yeah, documentary.

01:01:58.100 --> 01:02:00.100
-We're sorry. We didn't
wanna upset anybody.

01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:03.100
-Please don't come any closer.
-Give me that camera.

01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:03.800
-No. Uh!

01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:05.900
-Oh, my god.

01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:08.500
-Run. Go, go, go!

01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:10.200
-Uh!
-Hey!

01:02:12.100 --> 01:02:13.400
-Go! Go!

01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:16.000
-Aaaaaaaaaaah!

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.400
Aaaaah!

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:18.700
-Go!

01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:20.800
Go, go, go!
-Go, guys, go!

01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:29.400
Sorry. Sorry.

01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:31.700
-Flashlight.
-Flipped over the fuckin' door.

01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:34.300
-Oh.
-Oh, god.

01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:35.600
-Aw, shit.
What the hell's he doing?

01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:36.900
-Okay. Cool.
I did not bust my palm up.

01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:38.100
-We're good. Yeah.

01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:39.700
-What the hell was that guy
going on about?

01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:41.000
-Oh. Ah.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.300
-I'm not coming back here.

01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:43.800
-Okay. Okay.
-Stupid --

01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:47.300
-We're supposed to call Henry.

01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:50.500
Can anybody call him?
-I can't.

01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:55.400
-I don't know.

01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:57.800
-Hold on. Hold on.
I'm gonna put you on speaker.

01:02:57.800 --> 01:02:59.300
-I'm here. You guys,

01:02:59.300 --> 01:03:01.400
you go back to the van
and I'll meet you there.

01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:04.900
-Oh, god. Follow the shot.

01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:06.200
-Henry, Henry,
meet us at the van.

01:03:09.100 --> 01:03:12.200
Whew!

01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:13.700
Phew!

01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:26.200
Um, I

01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:28.800
seem to be a little lost.

01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:31.200
Um, could you come
and get me?

01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:34.500
I...think I'm at a garage.

01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:42.800
You wouldn't be able
to respond, now, would you?

01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:46.100
Um, but, if you could come
and get me,

01:03:46.100 --> 01:03:47.800
it's a really big garage.

01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:48.900
You can't miss it.

01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:54.600
Uh --

01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:56.700
You know, on second thought,
I-I think I'm gonna wait

01:03:56.700 --> 01:03:59.100
inside the garage.

01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:01.400
Yeah, inside.

01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:02.800
Ahem.

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:12.400
Oh, my god.

01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:16.100
It's Samson.

01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:17.100
-Max!

01:04:17.100 --> 01:04:19.100
Max, can you hear me?

01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:21.900
-Aah!

01:04:21.900 --> 01:04:23.400
Aah! Help!

01:04:25.700 --> 01:04:26.900
-Aah! Aah!

01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:35.700
-Ohhh!

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.200
-Keep going, guys.
That sound was this way.

01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:41.200
-Shit, I turned off my light!
Wait up.

01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:43.400
Oh, god. What is it?

01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:44.600
-That's Henry!

01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:45.700
-No fucking way.
-Oh, shit!

01:04:45.700 --> 01:04:47.200
-That happened
because we came here.

01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:48.400
We need to --

01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:49.900
-You're really gonna
do this now?

01:04:49.900 --> 01:04:52.100
-Oh, god, no!
-Whatever. I'm scared!

01:04:52.100 --> 01:04:53.800
-I'm scared, too,
but our best bet is

01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:56.200
to just make a beeline
for the van, no stopping.

01:04:56.200 --> 01:04:58.400
-I don't know. We just have

01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:00.300
to get outta here, now!
-Let's just. Let's just go.

01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:01.700
Let's just go.
Fine. To the van.

01:05:01.700 --> 01:05:04.300
-Oh, my god.

01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:10.100
-I don't recognize this place.
-Neither do I.

01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:12.800
-I-I-It looks familiar.
It's kind of different,

01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:14.100
but I think we're
on the right trail.

01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:16.500
It's gotta be headed
to the right direction.

01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:18.100
-I was gonna use Maps,
but it's dead.

01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:19.500
-Shit. Mine's dead, too.

01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:20.900
It died right after
I called Henry.

01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:23.500
-Mine's broken.
I didn't even bring it!

01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:24.800
-Shit!
-So you're saying that we're

01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:26.600
out here
with no form of communication?

01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:28.100
-Well, looks that way,
doesn't it?

01:05:28.100 --> 01:05:29.600
-Ahh!

01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:31.300
-No! Gunner!
-Aaaaaaah!

01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:33.000
-No! No!

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.600
Run!

01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:36.500
Oh, my god!

01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:38.200
-Ryan!

01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:40.300
Ry-a-a-an!

01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:42.700
Oh, my god!

01:05:42.700 --> 01:05:45.200
Oh, god!
-Shut up!

01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:47.600
Oh, fuck!

01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:50.000
Shouldn't we keep going?
-Run, run!

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.900
-Get to the van!
Get to the fucking van.

01:05:57.100 --> 01:05:58.200
-Gunner, hurry up!
-Sienna, wait up. Wait up.

01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:00.200
Wait up. Slow down.
Slow down.

01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:02.100
Slow down. Slow down.
-Come on, we gotta go!

01:06:02.100 --> 01:06:05.100
-Slow down. Slow down.
Look.

01:06:05.100 --> 01:06:06.200
Do you even know where we're at?

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:08.100
-I don't know.

01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:12.400
-Okay. I think that --

01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:14.000
I think -- I know we got
turned around, okay?

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:18.900
But I think -- I think, if we
just keep heading this way,

01:06:18.900 --> 01:06:21.800
we can get back to the underpass
with all the graffiti.

01:06:21.800 --> 01:06:23.100
-Ryan.

01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:32.400
-Okay. I think I've got
my bearings here.

01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:34.900
I know this -- this --
this forest is thick.

01:06:34.900 --> 01:06:37.600
We got off the path, but --

01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:42.600
-Okay. Um, okay, I think,
if we keep going this way --

01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:46.100
Sienna, Sienna, if --
if we keep going this way,

01:06:46.100 --> 01:06:47.600
I believe we can get to the
underpass with the graffiti.

01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:50.700
I-I just -- I have a feeling,
so let's just keep going.

01:06:50.700 --> 01:06:52.600
I know we can make it.
That's what Ryan would want.

01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:54.400
And let's start
calling out for Max.

01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:55.800
Max!
Max!

01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:57.600
-Ma-a-x!
-Max!

01:06:57.600 --> 01:06:58.400
Ma-a--!

01:07:00.700 --> 01:07:04.200
Oh, it's getting
so thick over here,

01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:05.500
but we just gotta keep going.

01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:08.200
I know. I just know
it's over here.

01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:09.400
Max!

01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:11.100
-You go ahead.
-Yeah. Yeah.

01:07:11.100 --> 01:07:13.300
Let me lead the way.
It's getting really bad.

01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:15.200
Just hold on to me.
Be careful.

01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:19.600
There's a big branch
right here. You got it?

01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:22.400
Okay. All right.

01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:23.600
Careful, careful.

01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:25.300
-We need to hurry!
-I know. I know, but --

01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:28.900
All right. It's a little
bit clearer. Come on. Come on.

01:07:30.700 --> 01:07:32.000
-Please don't!
-This way, this way.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.400
-Slow down. Slow down.
-Okay. Here. Grab my hand.

01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:39.400
-I don't know!

01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:41.700
I just -- I think the --
the underpass is over here.

01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:43.200
Oh, my god!

01:07:43.200 --> 01:07:44.300
-Shit!
-No, no, no.

01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:45.500
-Come on! Come on!
-No, that can't be.

01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:47.600
-Go, go, go, go!

01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:50.200
Gunner, Gunner, slow down.

01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:51.400
We're gonna --
!

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:53.800
-We're gonna be okay.

01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:56.900
We're gonna be okay.
Let's go!

01:07:56.900 --> 01:07:59.900
Just keep it --
Keep it together. Come on.

01:07:59.900 --> 01:08:01.100
That thing's right
fucking behind.

01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:06.800
Okay. I think -- I think we're
going the right way, still.

01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:08.600
-You have no idea
where we're going, do you?

01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:10.800
-I think. I don't know!

01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:12.500
I mean, I don't think this is --

01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:14.700
Fuck, what was that?
I don't think this is the --

01:08:14.700 --> 01:08:17.300
This isn't the time to be --
Oh, shit!

01:08:17.300 --> 01:08:19.399
-No. I think I recognize this.

01:08:19.399 --> 01:08:21.300
-No. Come on!
-Okay. Fuck!

01:08:21.300 --> 01:08:23.700
Fuck, do you hear that? God.

01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:25.700
-The sun's gotta be coming up
any minute now, right?

01:08:25.700 --> 01:08:28.100
We've been out here
for fucking hours!

01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:29.899
-Just shut up!
-Okay.

01:08:29.899 --> 01:08:32.200
Come on. Come on.

01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:33.500
If you know the right way,
just go.

01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:35.700
-I'm gonna go.
-Something's behind us. Go!

01:08:37.399 --> 01:08:40.600
What is it?
What is it

01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:43.100
Oh. Oh, shit.
I'm caught on something!

01:08:43.100 --> 01:08:45.200
Help me.
Come back here. Help me!

01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:46.500
I can't!
-Help me! Oh!

01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:49.700
Okay,
we just gotta keep going.

01:08:49.700 --> 01:08:52.000
We're almost --
We're almost back at the van.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.700
-How do you expect me
to keep going?

01:08:53.700 --> 01:08:56.500
-We just gotta stay calm.

01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:58.700
Ryan died, and --
I don't --

01:08:58.700 --> 01:09:01.500
We're almost back.
We just --

01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:03.200
We just gotta keep it together

01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:04.300
and we'll --

01:09:04.300 --> 01:09:06.300
-Aaaaaaaaaaah!

01:09:06.300 --> 01:09:08.700
Aggh! Aah!

01:09:08.700 --> 01:09:12.100
Don't go to the monkey farm!

01:09:12.100 --> 01:09:14.100
-Aaaaaaaaah!

01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:15.100
Oh, my god.

01:09:24.300 --> 01:09:27.899
Max! Max!

01:09:27.899 --> 01:09:29.800
Where the fuck am I?

01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:33.800
Max!
Please help me!

01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:34.899
Oh, my god.

01:09:36.899 --> 01:09:38.700
Max! Max!

01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:44.600
Max! Can you hear me?!

01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:50.200
Oh.

01:09:51.700 --> 01:09:53.800
Max Please. Please.

01:09:56.900 --> 01:09:58.900
Max!

01:09:58.900 --> 01:10:01.700
Oh, my god.

01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:13.200
Ma-a-x!

01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:15.800
Max!

01:10:18.900 --> 01:10:21.300
Help!

01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:22.400
Max!

01:10:29.100 --> 01:10:30.600
Where the fuck am I?

01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:35.700
Max! Please help!

01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:39.500
Max.

01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:41.100
Somebody, please.

01:10:45.100 --> 01:10:46.600
Ma-a-x!

01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:52.600
Max! Max!

01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:54.500
Please help me!

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:59.400
Oh!

01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:00.700
-Oh, my god!

01:11:00.700 --> 01:11:02.100
No! No!

01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:15.100
-Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!

01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:16.400
Aaaaaaaaah!

01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:18.300
Aaaaaaaaaaah!

01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:20.100
Aaaaaaah!

01:11:20.100 --> 01:11:21.600
-Aaaaaaaaah!

01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:23.500
Aaaaah! Aaaaah!

01:11:48.100 --> 01:11:50.400
Max! Max! Shit!

01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:54.500
Max.

01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:09.100
-Ever since the time of Darwin,
evolutionary scientists

01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:10.900
have noted
the anatomical similarities

01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:13.200
between humans
and the great apes,

01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:17.600
including chimpanzees,
gorillas, and orangutans.

01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:19.200
Over the last few decades,

01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:21.600
molecular biologists
have joined the fray,

01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:24.900
pointing out the similarities
in DNA sequences.

01:12:24.900 --> 01:12:26.600
Previous estimates
of genetic similarity

01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:28.200
between humans and chimpanzees

01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:33.800
suggested that they were
98.5% to 99.4% identical,

01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:36.800
which leads some to question
why we use the great apes,

01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:41.000
our cousins, as approved test
subjects for new and unproven,

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:44.400
sometimes even harmful,
medicines and surgeries.

01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:47.700
My name is Ryan Cornish and I'm
here to answer that question.

01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:53.100
Is that it?

01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:54.200
Am I done?
