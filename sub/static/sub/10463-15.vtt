WEBVTT

00:02.614 --> 00:05.218
<i>Next time you're out
on foot, remember,</i>

00:05.242 --> 00:09.463
<i>the man behind the wheel does
not expect the unexpected.</i>

00:14.668 --> 00:17.679
<i>A surprise like this
could be fatal.</i>

00:21.133 --> 00:22.476
All right, then.

00:23.302 --> 00:24.436
Now...

00:25.387 --> 00:27.022
Driving partners.

00:28.056 --> 00:31.151
Andy Pace will drive
with Martha Pierce.

00:31.602 --> 00:34.446
Michael Rawson drives
with Ruthie Rice.

00:34.980 --> 00:38.825
Julia Salinger drives
with Justin Thompson.

00:39.276 --> 00:40.744
Uh, excuse me.

00:40.986 --> 00:42.913
Can we, uh, switch partners?

00:43.405 --> 00:46.124
Why? So you could drive
with one of your friends?

00:46.575 --> 00:48.084
Uh, yeah.

00:48.577 --> 00:52.056
Young man, an automobile is
two tons of lethal power.

00:52.080 --> 00:56.144
If you think driving time can double
as social hour with your buddies,

00:56.168 --> 00:58.396
then you can just walk on
out of here right now.

00:58.420 --> 00:59.981
Just walk on out.

01:00.005 --> 01:01.223
All right.

01:03.759 --> 01:07.020
We'll be meeting in the parking
lot, next class, folks.

01:08.055 --> 01:10.357
So, I guess we're stuck
with each other, huh?

01:11.934 --> 01:14.027
Come on, Justin. I
made a mistake.

01:14.311 --> 01:16.488
A big mistake, but,
I said I was sorry.

01:16.897 --> 01:18.708
You're not really gonna spend
the rest of high school

01:18.732 --> 01:20.158
punishing me for that, are you?

01:20.609 --> 01:23.286
Well, Julia, I just might.

01:29.284 --> 01:32.546
Okay, so, Chapter 11, boom,
out of the way. Moving on.

01:32.621 --> 01:34.140
Here's the Chapter
12 sample test.

01:34.164 --> 01:35.674
You give me Chapter 13.

01:37.292 --> 01:39.270
Yeah, uh, you know what, Will?

01:39.294 --> 01:40.521
Oh, man, don't say it.

01:40.545 --> 01:41.522
No, I have a reason.

01:41.546 --> 01:45.652
Yeah. Well, let me guess. Five-six,
blond, answers to the name of Jill?

01:45.676 --> 01:47.894
We just... We kind of got busy.

01:48.011 --> 01:49.989
Let me explain this
study-partner thing to you,

01:50.013 --> 01:51.658
because you seem a little
unclear, all right?

01:51.682 --> 01:54.244
A study partner is someone
who doesI half the work

01:54.268 --> 01:56.611
and then shares his acquired
knowledge with you.

01:57.145 --> 01:58.331
I'll do it tomorrow.

01:58.355 --> 02:00.667
When? We're going to the Fillmore
tomorrow night, remember?

02:00.691 --> 02:01.908
I have study hall.

02:02.484 --> 02:04.244
Is Jill in the study hall?

02:05.028 --> 02:06.413
What are you, my mother?

02:06.822 --> 02:07.799
I'll get to it.

02:07.823 --> 02:09.842
Well, you better, because the
test is Thursday, you know?

02:09.866 --> 02:11.126
I know.

02:11.910 --> 02:13.378
I'll do it.

02:15.000 --> 02:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:22.546 --> 02:23.773
Can you believe that?

02:23.797 --> 02:26.317
I know, I know. It's one step away
from the Spanish Inquisition.

02:26.341 --> 02:27.986
Oh, no.

02:28.010 --> 02:30.896
But, you absolutely
sailed through today.

02:31.638 --> 02:33.783
I mean, seriously. The way
you stared down Demott

02:33.807 --> 02:35.868
when he asked you about
publication possibilities?

02:35.892 --> 02:38.037
I wasn't staring him down.
I was panicking.

02:38.061 --> 02:40.488
I don't know the first thing about
publication for this thing.

02:41.356 --> 02:42.750
Charlie. Hi!

02:42.774 --> 02:44.034
Hey.

02:44.401 --> 02:47.537
Charlie, this is Ben Atkins, my
advisor for my dissertation.

02:47.946 --> 02:50.466
The topic of which was just
formally approved this afternoon

02:50.490 --> 02:52.292
by the U.C. Psych Department.

02:53.076 --> 02:55.430
Really? Kirsten, that's great.

02:55.454 --> 02:57.255
- Yeah.
- They all loved her.

02:57.414 --> 02:59.434
- Right. Except Demott.
- Well...

02:59.458 --> 03:01.602
Demott? He's the one you told
me about who thought your work

03:01.626 --> 03:03.271
should be more
scientific and less...

03:03.295 --> 03:05.523
Anecdotal? No, that's Upton.

03:05.547 --> 03:07.400
Yeah, Upton loved the
proposal, didn't he?

03:07.424 --> 03:08.401
- Mmm-hmm.
- That's weird.

03:08.425 --> 03:09.777
Yeah, he's usually so, um...

03:09.801 --> 03:10.695
So what?

03:10.719 --> 03:12.395
- Exactly!
- You know...

03:13.513 --> 03:15.199
Anyway, we thought we'd
celebrate the good news

03:15.223 --> 03:17.160
before I hit the ground
running tomorrow.

03:17.184 --> 03:18.818
Which you will be, I might add.

03:18.977 --> 03:20.913
The benefit of
being her advisor.

03:20.937 --> 03:22.206
I can say things like that.

03:22.230 --> 03:23.875
Oh, yeah? You gonna
push me around?

03:23.899 --> 03:25.668
I'm gonna be cracking
that whip night and day.

03:25.692 --> 03:27.994
You are mine now.
I own you, baby.

03:31.073 --> 03:32.383
Champagne?

03:32.407 --> 03:34.250
Yes.

Claudia,

04:13.990 --> 04:15.718
I hate being late for lunch.

04:15.742 --> 04:17.470
All the crusty top on
the mac and cheese

04:17.494 --> 04:19.096
is gonna be gone
when we get there.

04:19.120 --> 04:20.348
Relax.

04:20.372 --> 04:21.724
This will take five minutes.

04:21.748 --> 04:24.843
Okay, kids. This whole
thing is my fault.

04:24.960 --> 04:27.438
In the future, I'll be
sure to cast understudies

04:27.462 --> 04:29.691
for all the major parts
in these productions,

04:29.715 --> 04:32.026
but I learned my lesson
the hard way this time.

04:32.050 --> 04:36.563
So today I'm looking for someone who
can jump right into the role of Oliver

04:36.596 --> 04:39.149
and be prepared to
perform it this weekend.

04:39.433 --> 04:41.651
Let's start by warming
up our voices.

04:50.652 --> 04:52.880
So, uh, what happened
to the guy they picked

04:52.904 --> 04:54.382
to play Oliver in
the first place?

04:54.406 --> 04:56.884
Bennie Craven. He got
sick or something.

04:56.908 --> 04:58.386
I don't know.

04:58.410 --> 05:01.629
All I know is he's
out, and I'm in.

05:01.747 --> 05:04.007
What makes you so sure
you're gonna get it?

05:04.040 --> 05:06.102
Okay, one, I'm the best singer.

05:06.126 --> 05:08.187
I always do the
solos at Christmas.

05:08.211 --> 05:10.857
Two, I already know the part
because Mom had the video on tape,

05:10.881 --> 05:12.557
and we used to watch
it all the time.

05:12.674 --> 05:15.643
Three, Mrs. Cooper-Stabler
told me herself.

05:15.927 --> 05:19.481
It was time for me to get out of the
orchestra pit and start performing.

05:19.765 --> 05:22.118
You'd rather be in the cast
than play in the orchestra?

05:22.142 --> 05:23.359
How come?

05:23.393 --> 05:26.446
Because musicians, they
grow up to be band geeks,

05:26.772 --> 05:28.990
and actors grow up to be stars.

05:35.071 --> 05:36.382
You heading out already?

05:36.406 --> 05:39.042
Yeah. I've gotta go to all
these daycare centers.

05:39.201 --> 05:41.471
I need an ethnically diverse
group by next month,

05:41.495 --> 05:44.339
so we've got to visit
these places ASAP.

05:44.748 --> 05:46.100
We?

05:46.124 --> 05:47.467
Ben and me.

05:49.085 --> 05:50.887
He's around for this stuff too?

05:51.171 --> 05:53.014
Yeah. He said he wanted to be.

05:54.341 --> 05:56.601
Awful hands-on, isn't he?

05:57.427 --> 06:01.606
It seemed a little funny about the
champagne, all that stuff about owning you.

06:03.683 --> 06:05.235
You're cute.

06:06.770 --> 06:08.696
Have a good day.

06:09.231 --> 06:10.949
He called you "baby."

06:13.318 --> 06:15.630
Up on the clutch, down on
the gas simultaneously.

06:15.654 --> 06:17.340
Simul... Simul... Dammit, girl.

06:17.364 --> 06:19.717
Don't you know the
meaning of the word?

06:19.741 --> 06:22.836
Clutch in. In. In. In!

06:22.911 --> 06:25.097
Listen, girlie...

06:25.121 --> 06:27.475
Please don't call me "girlie," sir.
It's sexist.

06:27.499 --> 06:29.769
She's right. "Girlie" implies
there's something gender-specific

06:29.793 --> 06:31.312
about her terrible driving.

06:31.336 --> 06:34.232
Right, and we all know there are just
as many bad male drivers on the road

06:34.256 --> 06:35.942
as there are bad female drivers.

06:35.966 --> 06:38.726
Well, no offense, sweetheart,
but in my experience,

06:38.760 --> 06:42.814
the gentler sex just doesn't have
what it takes to control a car.

06:43.265 --> 06:45.243
You took that Civics
class, Justin.

06:45.267 --> 06:48.945
Just out of curiosity, what Mr.
Parker just said, is that actionable?

06:49.145 --> 06:51.040
What do you mean, "actionable?"

06:51.064 --> 06:54.502
I mean, I'd have to check my notes, but
it sounds pretty discriminatory to me.

06:54.526 --> 06:57.046
Hey, hey, no one's
discriminating anyone here.

06:57.070 --> 06:59.539
I'm just trying to teach
the little lady to drive.

06:59.614 --> 07:02.718
"Little lady"? I mean,
that's totally out of line.

07:02.742 --> 07:05.888
Wait, wait. Whoa. What are
you writing down there?

07:05.912 --> 07:07.974
You know what would be fun?
Just as an experiment,

07:07.998 --> 07:10.434
we could file a formal complaint,
you know, maybe for extra credit.

07:10.458 --> 07:11.853
Yeah. Yeah.

07:11.877 --> 07:14.596
Hey. No one's filing
anything here.

07:14.754 --> 07:20.268
I'm... I'm... I'm... I'm just... We're...
We're try... Uh... I...

07:23.430 --> 07:25.064
All right.

07:27.017 --> 07:32.906
I apologize for anything I
said that may have offended.

07:33.356 --> 07:35.751
Why don't we just
put it behind us

07:35.775 --> 07:38.077
and get back to the
matter at hand.

07:40.447 --> 07:42.582
Whenever you're ready.

07:49.915 --> 07:51.684
It'd probably be
good to practice.

07:51.708 --> 07:56.804
It'll keep my mind off Oliver. Mrs.
Cooper-Stabler still hasn't called.

07:56.922 --> 07:58.274
How about the Bach?

07:58.298 --> 08:01.476
Yeah, but, uh, before that...

08:01.509 --> 08:04.062
- What?
- Well,

08:04.596 --> 08:08.451
remember today at the tryouts
when I left to go to the, uh...

08:08.475 --> 08:10.828
Bathroom. Yeah.

08:10.852 --> 08:15.666
Well, I went back in, and the
lady, the one at the piano.

08:15.690 --> 08:18.711
Mrs. Cooper-Stabler?
She's a director.

08:18.735 --> 08:20.411
Pfft. "Lady."

08:20.612 --> 08:23.257
Well, she thought I
was there to try out,

08:23.281 --> 08:26.918
and I made a big deal of saying how
I was just looking for you, but...

08:27.535 --> 08:29.963
She kind of wouldn't
take no for an answer.

08:31.498 --> 08:33.508
And?

08:34.042 --> 08:38.011
And I kind of sang, and she kind
of thought I wasn't too bad,

08:38.462 --> 08:41.432
and she kind of asked me
if I wouldn't mind...

08:42.342 --> 08:43.851
Being Oliver.

08:44.844 --> 08:46.396
You?

08:46.721 --> 08:48.273
But what about me?

08:48.390 --> 08:52.026
Well... You get to
be my understudy.

08:55.063 --> 08:56.614
Hey, Justin.

08:57.524 --> 08:59.877
Back there you helped me out,

08:59.901 --> 09:02.787
and I just thought maybe you
weren't mad at me anymore.

09:03.405 --> 09:05.707
I mean, you're not, right?

09:06.658 --> 09:10.012
You girls, man. Why do you always
have to talk about everything?

09:10.036 --> 09:13.840
No, I'm just... I'm just
glad we're in the same car.

09:14.749 --> 09:18.136
See? There you go again.
Yap, yap, yap, yap, yap.

09:29.431 --> 09:31.075
Give me the key back.

09:31.099 --> 09:33.109
No. I'm keeping it.
It's mine now.

09:33.935 --> 09:35.371
- Hey, Will.
- Oh, hey.

09:35.395 --> 09:38.165
Bailey just let me drive his Jeep down
the crookedest street in the world.

09:38.189 --> 09:41.043
Hey, man, it's like 8:30.
We said 8:00.

09:41.067 --> 09:42.294
We almost tipped. I swear.

09:42.318 --> 09:43.337
I was in complete control.

09:43.361 --> 09:44.630
You were not in
complete control.

09:44.654 --> 09:46.372
- Excuse me.
- We'd better split.

09:46.531 --> 09:47.842
We're gonna be late.

09:47.866 --> 09:49.719
Oh, um, listen, man,

09:49.743 --> 09:52.555
Jill saw these guys last
time they were in town and...

09:52.579 --> 09:55.506
Ugh. One of the few bands
who's actually worse live.

09:55.540 --> 09:57.435
So, what, you don't want to go?

09:57.459 --> 09:59.103
Well, not if it's gonna be bad.

09:59.127 --> 10:00.646
Well, you don't
know that for sure.

10:00.670 --> 10:02.638
Besides, it's not like we
have anything else to do.

10:03.256 --> 10:05.776
- Uh, actually...
- There's this party.

10:05.800 --> 10:07.278
Wait a minute, wait a
minute, wait a minute.

10:07.302 --> 10:08.696
We said we were
going to do this.

10:08.720 --> 10:10.114
I know. I know, but, listen...

10:10.138 --> 10:11.824
Okay, listen, it's at
this psychic's house,

10:11.848 --> 10:15.202
all right, and there's gonna be all these tea
leaf readers, and, like, tarot card people.

10:15.226 --> 10:16.736
They all tell your future.

10:16.895 --> 10:19.040
So you're flaking out. Is
that what you're saying?

10:19.064 --> 10:20.875
No, I just think we'd all
have a better time...

10:20.899 --> 10:22.909
It's gonna be great. Trust me.

10:23.818 --> 10:26.130
Well, you want to tell me what I'm
supposed to do with these tickets?

10:26.154 --> 10:27.497
Because they weren't cheap.

10:29.657 --> 10:31.167
Hey.

10:31.451 --> 10:34.837
Want to buy two tickets to the Random
Notes at the Fillmore tonight?

10:39.000 --> 10:41.719
Joe will let us use his
new cabin for free.

10:43.213 --> 10:44.680
It'll be great.

10:45.215 --> 10:48.184
It has its own steam
bath for after skiing.

10:48.551 --> 10:50.228
I don't know how to ski.

10:50.804 --> 10:53.199
You don't have to know how
to ski to use a steam bath.

10:53.223 --> 10:55.024
You just have to know
how to get naked.

11:02.148 --> 11:03.825
What's that?

11:04.442 --> 11:06.661
Just some stuff I
have to tell Ben.

11:08.071 --> 11:09.090
Can't it wait till...?

11:09.114 --> 11:10.665
Let me finish this thought.

11:19.791 --> 11:22.301
- Charlie...
- What?

11:22.585 --> 11:24.303
Let me concentrate.

11:28.216 --> 11:29.892
Fine.

11:34.055 --> 11:37.108
Look, Charlie, we don't have to
have sex every night, you know.

11:37.559 --> 11:39.360
God forbid.

11:39.727 --> 11:42.905
I just have some other
things on my mind right now.

11:43.398 --> 11:46.200
Yeah. So I see.

11:56.828 --> 11:58.681
Keys, keys, keys.

11:58.705 --> 11:59.807
Yeah, I'm making pancakes.

11:59.831 --> 12:01.100
Not for me. I'm late.

12:01.124 --> 12:02.935
Hey, make sure you're
home by 8 tonight.

12:02.959 --> 12:04.979
I told Mark and Em we'd
meet them at the Firehouse.

12:05.003 --> 12:06.272
Charlie, you know I'm busy.

12:06.296 --> 12:07.690
Thurber, down.

12:07.714 --> 12:09.098
Yeah, but not all night.

12:09.132 --> 12:10.818
Don't nursery schools
close by 6:00?

12:10.842 --> 12:12.778
Yeah, but then Ben and I have
to talk about what we've seen,

12:12.802 --> 12:14.145
which kids will work, all that.

12:14.220 --> 12:15.396
Thurber!

12:15.471 --> 12:16.991
Got pancakes here, Julia.

12:17.015 --> 12:18.608
No, thanks. Dieting.

12:20.059 --> 12:21.203
That's Ben. I've got to go.

12:21.227 --> 12:22.788
Thurber, no.

12:22.812 --> 12:24.322
I hate when people honk.

12:24.355 --> 12:26.667
How much can it take to get out
of your car and ring the bell?

12:26.691 --> 12:28.377
So you ready for
pancakes, Charlie?

12:28.401 --> 12:30.036
I don't eat breakfast.

12:31.279 --> 12:33.215
What does Artie know
about being an orphan?

12:33.239 --> 12:34.216
Nothing.

12:34.240 --> 12:36.635
He's never been one,
even for a little while.

12:36.659 --> 12:38.878
I've been one for
almost a year now.

12:39.120 --> 12:42.173
I mean, it's not like there're
that many upsides to orphanhood.

12:42.498 --> 12:45.060
At least you figure getting the
part of Oliver would be one.

12:45.084 --> 12:48.054
Have a pancake, Claudia.
It'll make you feel better.

12:48.463 --> 12:50.056
I'm not hungry.

12:50.465 --> 12:52.141
Thurber!

12:52.634 --> 12:55.561
We didn't mean to leave the party
without you. We couldn't find you.

12:55.845 --> 12:57.990
I was right there, with
that lady in the turban.

12:58.014 --> 13:00.066
She was yelling at me
about my blocked chakra.

13:00.099 --> 13:02.995
Look, I'm really sorry. We
thought we looked everywhere.

13:03.019 --> 13:04.663
Here, look, let me
pay you for the cab.

13:04.687 --> 13:07.156
Forget it, all right? Just
give me that practice test.

13:07.690 --> 13:10.618
That is, if Party Girl will
actually let you study.

13:11.486 --> 13:13.589
Look, she thought
you'd have fun.

13:13.613 --> 13:15.456
Someone told her there'd
be some cool girls there.

13:15.531 --> 13:18.135
I wasn't aware that I'd signed
up for Jill's dating service.

13:18.159 --> 13:21.128
Give her a break. She likes you.
She was trying to be nice.

13:21.371 --> 13:22.681
Well, give her a tip, all right?

13:22.705 --> 13:25.800
Changing my plans and scalping my
tickets is the wrong approach.

13:26.376 --> 13:29.387
Did I say I was sorry? Because
I thought I said I was sorry.

13:29.587 --> 13:31.973
All right. All right.
Just don't do it again.

13:32.966 --> 13:34.443
Julia, Claudia, we're leaving.

13:34.467 --> 13:36.320
Hey, guys, I made pancakes.

13:36.344 --> 13:37.979
We're late. Thanks, anyway.

14:00.201 --> 14:01.711
Libby?

14:02.161 --> 14:04.672
The handle broke on me.

14:04.914 --> 14:07.977
You are completely unsafe
around anything mechanical.

14:08.001 --> 14:09.427
I am not.

14:09.585 --> 14:13.065
Come on. What about the helium
machine at my 10th birthday party?

14:13.089 --> 14:14.650
Or your dad's telescope?

14:14.674 --> 14:17.935
Okay, so I have a little
trouble with moving parts.

14:18.886 --> 14:21.939
Well, it's nice to know
some things never change.

14:23.599 --> 14:25.452
So how you been?

14:25.476 --> 14:27.445
We never seem to...

14:27.937 --> 14:29.331
Talk any more.

14:29.355 --> 14:30.781
Yeah.

14:32.066 --> 14:34.670
Well, I guess that's
what happens, you know.

14:34.694 --> 14:36.005
I mean, you make new friends.

14:36.029 --> 14:37.622
Right.

14:37.905 --> 14:40.592
I've been hanging out with these
guys from the Film Society a lot.

14:40.616 --> 14:41.959
Oh, yeah. Cool.

14:42.744 --> 14:45.338
I've even kind of started
going out with one of them.

14:46.039 --> 14:47.882
Libby, that's great. Who is it?

14:48.249 --> 14:50.644
Well, I don't want to say
'cause if it doesn't work out,

14:50.668 --> 14:52.354
I'll feel stupid for
blabbing about him.

14:52.378 --> 14:53.897
Okay.

14:53.921 --> 14:55.514
So how about you?

14:55.590 --> 14:56.942
Do you have a boyfriend?

14:56.966 --> 15:00.654
No. I mean, there's someone,
but it's not like that.

15:00.678 --> 15:03.073
We used to be friends and I
kind of blew it, so now...

15:03.097 --> 15:04.450
So now he's probably
madly in love with you

15:04.474 --> 15:05.993
and waiting for you
to make a move.

15:06.017 --> 15:07.526
I seriously doubt it.

15:07.685 --> 15:09.278
You should do what I did.

15:09.479 --> 15:13.157
I thought this guy maybe liked me, so I
arranged it so that I was around him a lot,

15:13.733 --> 15:15.660
and the next thing I knew...

15:16.027 --> 15:17.411
Really?

15:18.946 --> 15:21.707
Please, sir, can I
have a second helping?

15:22.492 --> 15:24.585
You're kidding, right?

15:25.495 --> 15:27.880
What? Is that not the line?

15:27.914 --> 15:29.715
No, it's not the line.

15:29.791 --> 15:31.477
So tell me what it is.

15:31.501 --> 15:32.770
"More."

15:32.794 --> 15:34.762
"Please, sir, I want some more."

15:34.796 --> 15:37.014
It's only the most
famous line in the play.

15:37.423 --> 15:41.070
You know, you don't have to be all snotty
just because I got the part you wanted.

15:41.094 --> 15:42.687
Oh, please.

15:43.179 --> 15:45.532
We all know why you got
Oliver instead of me.

15:45.556 --> 15:47.024
What's that supposed to mean?

15:47.141 --> 15:48.911
I think we both know
that if I was a boy,

15:48.935 --> 15:51.487
I'd be Oliver and you'd
be the understudy.

15:51.562 --> 15:53.948
- What?
- I'm the victim of sexuality!

15:54.107 --> 15:56.784
Or... No, no. No, no.
That's something else.

15:57.276 --> 15:59.463
I'm a victim... Of something.

15:59.487 --> 16:02.498
Yeah, your own swelled head.

16:02.573 --> 16:04.802
Face it. If girls were treated
the same way as boys,

16:04.826 --> 16:06.470
I'd be the star of the show,
and you'd better believe

16:06.494 --> 16:09.348
I wouldn't mess up the
most famous line too.

16:09.372 --> 16:11.308
Hey, I know the line, okay?

16:11.332 --> 16:13.426
Okay, then. Fine.

16:14.585 --> 16:16.595
Guess you don't need
my help anymore.

16:21.008 --> 16:23.185
Okay. What is a catalyst?

16:23.553 --> 16:25.531
Uh, catalyst. Wait a second.
I know this one.

16:25.555 --> 16:27.356
A catalyst is...

16:28.224 --> 16:30.317
Uh, I give up.

16:31.769 --> 16:33.112
Hey!

16:33.187 --> 16:37.334
A catalyst is a substance that initiates
the chemical reaction and allows it

16:37.358 --> 16:40.129
to proceed under different
conditions than otherwise possible.

16:40.153 --> 16:41.088
Right.

16:41.112 --> 16:43.664
The Blue Angels are flying
formation over the Presidio.

16:43.698 --> 16:46.751
We can go to the roof of our house,
and they'd fly right over our heads.

16:46.784 --> 16:48.137
We have to study.

16:48.161 --> 16:50.588
Mmm, I'm not so sure about that.

16:51.998 --> 16:53.632
What's that?

16:53.833 --> 16:57.678
"Mr. Gordon. 11th grade chemistry.
Thursday, January 12th.

16:58.296 --> 17:00.264
Not for distribution."

17:00.465 --> 17:02.141
Wait a second.

17:02.550 --> 17:04.101
Is that a copy of our test?

17:04.635 --> 17:05.945
Where did you...?

17:05.970 --> 17:09.898
Just happened to be passing by Gordon's
office when he went to take a whiz.

17:10.808 --> 17:13.027
Couldn't help noticing
the Xerox in the trash.

17:13.269 --> 17:14.862
You stole the test?

17:18.441 --> 17:20.159
No one saw.

17:21.234 --> 17:24.121
Well, you're all worried about
doing well on it, and now you can.

17:24.196 --> 17:25.790
And have fun this afternoon.

17:27.157 --> 17:29.011
What? Something wrong?

17:29.035 --> 17:31.962
Hey, news flash, Jill. They kick
you out for stuff like that.

17:32.121 --> 17:34.131
Well, not if you
don't get caught.

17:34.290 --> 17:36.393
God, that is so not the point.

17:36.417 --> 17:38.385
Well, what is your point?

17:38.920 --> 17:40.554
What is his point?

17:42.089 --> 17:46.352
His point is... That you just... You
really didn't need to do this, Jill.

17:48.095 --> 17:49.480
Fine.

17:50.056 --> 17:51.482
Forget it.

17:52.016 --> 17:54.985
You both can fail together, and
I'll watch the Blue Angels alone.

17:55.520 --> 17:57.238
Come on, Jill...

17:59.315 --> 18:00.991
Nice girl.

18:09.492 --> 18:11.335
Looks like rain, huh?

18:14.330 --> 18:15.756
How was the Firehouse?

18:17.583 --> 18:19.051
I didn't go.

18:21.879 --> 18:23.430
How come?

18:25.216 --> 18:26.934
Not in the mood.

18:35.393 --> 18:37.236
What is that?

18:37.353 --> 18:39.613
I found it in your pocket.

18:41.315 --> 18:43.534
You're going through my pockets?

18:43.651 --> 18:46.036
I was doing the laundry, okay?

18:48.823 --> 18:51.218
You said you spent the
entire day working with Ben,

18:51.242 --> 18:53.961
and then I find out that you actually
went to the movies with him.

18:54.078 --> 18:56.463
We had a three-hour break
between appointments.

18:56.497 --> 18:58.225
We were fried. We
went to a movie.

18:58.249 --> 18:59.351
Did he pay?

18:59.375 --> 19:00.634
What?

19:01.002 --> 19:02.688
What is the big deal here?

19:02.712 --> 19:05.816
You don't go to movies with people you
have a professional relationship with,

19:05.840 --> 19:08.601
so, what is he to you?

19:08.634 --> 19:10.769
A friend? A professor? What?

19:11.637 --> 19:13.282
Because I have a right to know.

19:13.306 --> 19:15.367
Because when we're in bed,
and I'm thinking about you...

19:15.391 --> 19:16.734
Wait.

19:16.767 --> 19:19.820
Is all this because we
didn't have sex last night?

19:20.104 --> 19:22.281
It's because you lied to me.

19:23.983 --> 19:25.576
You know what, Charlie?

19:26.444 --> 19:28.287
You have no right to suspect me.

19:28.321 --> 19:30.039
I didn't do anything wrong.

19:31.365 --> 19:34.543
And coming from someone with your
track record, this is almost funny.

19:41.417 --> 19:42.843
Mint tea, please.

20:19.622 --> 20:21.058
To go, please.

20:21.082 --> 20:22.800
You got it.

20:35.054 --> 20:37.731
Claudia. Claudia!

20:38.849 --> 20:40.077
What do you want?

20:40.101 --> 20:41.694
You won't come to the phone.

20:42.019 --> 20:43.529
Look, Claudia, listen...

20:43.688 --> 20:46.657
I don't think we should fight
about this stupid play.

20:46.732 --> 20:49.211
Stupid play? No wonder you
can't remember the lines.

20:49.235 --> 20:51.004
- You have no respect for it.
- Yeah, I do,

20:51.028 --> 20:53.747
but this drama stuff's
just supposed to be fun.

20:54.156 --> 20:56.593
So I got the lead this time.
So what?

20:56.617 --> 20:58.178
Next time you will.

20:58.202 --> 20:59.878
I don't want it next time.

20:59.995 --> 21:03.058
Oliver was my part. I deserved
it, and you took it from me.

21:03.082 --> 21:04.925
I didn't mean to.

21:05.251 --> 21:07.062
Look, it's really wet out here.

21:07.086 --> 21:08.522
Yeah, because it's raining.

21:08.546 --> 21:10.848
Can't I come inside? I'm cold.

21:11.465 --> 21:13.527
Oh, yeah? Well, so was Oliver.

21:13.551 --> 21:17.229
Maybe you can use that in your performance.
I'm going to bed.

21:28.482 --> 21:30.075
Hi.

21:30.568 --> 21:32.494
Where's Mr. Eagle Scout?

21:33.988 --> 21:36.633
Look, Will is a good guy.

21:36.657 --> 21:38.301
He is. He's...

21:38.325 --> 21:40.178
He's just not into
breaking the rules, so...

21:40.202 --> 21:41.346
Yeah, right.

21:41.370 --> 21:43.306
That's why he steals
desserts from the cafeteria

21:43.330 --> 21:46.768
and he was perfectly happy to take twice the
face value off those tickets last night.

21:46.792 --> 21:50.512
I'm not saying he's a saint, but
those things, those are little.

21:51.338 --> 21:52.524
This test thing, Jill...

21:52.548 --> 21:54.568
So, what? Breaking the
little rules is cool,

21:54.592 --> 21:56.194
but when you get to
the mid-size rules,

21:56.218 --> 21:57.904
suddenly it's not okay anymore?

21:57.928 --> 21:58.905
Well...

21:58.929 --> 22:01.190
So where is that line, huh?

22:01.807 --> 22:03.702
Tell me, what is the
worst thing you could do

22:03.726 --> 22:06.653
and still look at me and say,
"At least I'm not that bad?"

22:07.438 --> 22:08.999
That's not what I'm saying.

22:09.023 --> 22:10.532
It's what you meant.

22:10.608 --> 22:13.077
The way you looked at me
in the library was like...

22:14.612 --> 22:16.830
I embarrassed you or something.

22:17.072 --> 22:18.791
No, that's not...

22:18.908 --> 22:20.427
You don't embarrass me.

22:20.451 --> 22:22.086
Save it, okay?

22:22.787 --> 22:24.681
Just don't act like you
don't bend the rules,

22:24.705 --> 22:27.549
because you do it all the
time, and so does Will.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.728
You're both real jerks to act
like you're better than me

22:29.752 --> 22:31.386
just because I
tried to help you.

22:42.097 --> 22:44.159
Well, look on the bright side.

22:44.183 --> 22:46.870
At least San Francisco has a good
public transportation system.

22:46.894 --> 22:49.623
It's G.I. Joe over there. He makes
me so nervous, yelling like that.

22:49.647 --> 22:52.366
I just fritz out when people yell at me.
I always have.

22:52.483 --> 22:55.545
I know. My mom still talks
about chewing you out

22:55.569 --> 22:58.497
for spilling that
snow-cone on my rug.

22:58.739 --> 23:00.175
"The tears!"

23:00.199 --> 23:01.676
I know, I know. I'm
too sensitive.

23:01.700 --> 23:02.802
I should stop being
so sensitive.

23:02.826 --> 23:04.545
No, no, no. Not at all.

23:06.205 --> 23:09.424
So, um, what would you say
if I asked you a favor?

23:11.460 --> 23:13.178
Depends on what the favor is.

23:13.379 --> 23:16.107
Um, private driving lessons.

23:16.131 --> 23:17.599
No yelling.

23:19.718 --> 23:21.112
Yeah. I guess I could do that.

23:21.136 --> 23:22.322
Really?

23:22.346 --> 23:24.106
Yeah. Why not?

23:24.390 --> 23:27.776
We can use my mom's car. She's cool
as long as we stay on the block.

23:27.810 --> 23:30.821
Um... This afternoon, maybe,

23:31.605 --> 23:33.574
unless you're busy.

23:34.900 --> 23:38.579
No. I'm, uh... I'm not
doing anything, really.

23:39.280 --> 23:41.164
And you won't yell?

23:41.532 --> 23:43.218
No. I'm a very calm person.

23:43.242 --> 23:46.211
I know. I like that about you.

23:54.753 --> 23:56.680
I'm sorry about last night.

23:57.131 --> 23:58.724
You were wrong.

23:59.550 --> 24:02.227
I know. I know.

24:04.763 --> 24:09.369
It's just this new
arrangement thing.

24:09.393 --> 24:11.028
I mean...

24:12.104 --> 24:15.490
Here we are, living together,
and what does that mean?

24:15.691 --> 24:18.243
I guess I'm just a little
confused about that.

24:22.031 --> 24:24.082
Well, what do we need to do?

24:24.491 --> 24:26.386
Should I tell you my
schedule every day?

24:26.410 --> 24:27.878
No.

24:28.329 --> 24:29.931
I just...

24:29.955 --> 24:34.009
I'd rather not find out after the fact that
you did something social with this guy.

24:34.168 --> 24:35.844
It was spur of the moment.

24:36.086 --> 24:38.513
So tell me when you come home.

24:39.715 --> 24:43.403
Say, "Guess what? We went to see a movie.
It was great. You'd like it.

24:43.427 --> 24:45.270
I'll see it with you
again, if you want."

24:45.387 --> 24:47.689
It was terrible. You'd hate it.

24:50.142 --> 24:52.277
But I'll see it again with
you if you want me to.

24:53.228 --> 24:54.488
Hey, guys.

24:54.855 --> 24:56.458
- Hey.
- Hi.

24:56.482 --> 24:59.461
Oh, Kirsten, Ben Atkins called.

24:59.485 --> 25:02.746
Said dinner tonight was
dressy, so get prettied up.

25:03.155 --> 25:05.040
Those were his words, not mine.

25:06.367 --> 25:08.502
You're going out to
dinner with him?

25:09.662 --> 25:12.089
It's just a faculty dinner.

25:16.043 --> 25:19.638
You know what, Owen, how'd you like
to do this in the living room?

25:22.716 --> 25:24.653
So why didn't he
invite the both of us?

25:24.677 --> 25:26.728
I mean, we are a couple.

25:27.971 --> 25:29.908
It's not a couple thing.
It's work.

25:29.932 --> 25:32.901
But you'll be there with this Ben
guy, so you two will be a couple.

25:33.143 --> 25:34.871
It's completely innocent.

25:34.895 --> 25:37.948
A guy asks you out to a dinner
party, it's not innocent.

25:39.316 --> 25:41.785
- I don't want you to go.
- I'm sorry.

25:41.985 --> 25:45.423
When exactly did it become your right
to say what I could and couldn't do?

25:45.447 --> 25:48.635
We're living together. I'm allowed
to say you can't date other guys.

25:48.659 --> 25:50.127
It's not a date.

25:50.786 --> 25:53.306
Look, Ben wants to
take me to a dinner

25:53.330 --> 25:54.808
where I can build relationships

25:54.832 --> 25:57.718
with the people that are going to
be deciding my academic future.

25:57.751 --> 25:59.219
It's a very generous gesture.

25:59.420 --> 26:01.179
No, it's not.

26:01.588 --> 26:03.441
Look, I know guys. I am one.

26:03.465 --> 26:05.684
We're not generous when it
comes to women like you.

26:07.344 --> 26:09.396
It's so obvious what he's doing.

26:09.471 --> 26:11.157
Hanging around you, trying
to get to know you,

26:11.181 --> 26:13.451
waiting for an opening.
It's textbook.

26:13.475 --> 26:15.736
It's exactly what I'd be
doing in his situation.

26:15.769 --> 26:17.738
Oh, for God's sake, Charlie.

26:17.813 --> 26:18.998
Oh.

26:19.022 --> 26:21.033
Leave in the middle of a fight.
Great.

26:21.567 --> 26:24.337
Look, I'm going to this dinner,

26:24.361 --> 26:26.005
and if you have a
problem with it,

26:26.029 --> 26:27.956
then it's exactly
that, your problem.

26:33.245 --> 26:35.255
Top of the morning, sir.

26:39.126 --> 26:41.595
Top of the morning, sir.

26:42.004 --> 26:43.857
Top of the morning, sir.

26:43.881 --> 26:45.348
Claudia,

26:46.592 --> 26:48.987
how confident do you
feel about this part?

26:49.011 --> 26:51.614
Excuse me. I have one line.

26:51.638 --> 26:53.482
I think I can handle it.

26:54.725 --> 26:57.778
Honey, I'm talking about
the role of Oliver.

26:57.811 --> 26:58.997
Why?

26:59.021 --> 27:02.074
We're going to need you up on
stage when we open tomorrow.

27:02.483 --> 27:04.836
Wait a minute. What
happened to Artie?

27:04.860 --> 27:06.369
His mom said he was sick.

27:06.445 --> 27:07.839
With what?

27:07.863 --> 27:10.582
Well, I'm not sure, but
evidently, he's lost his voice.

27:11.366 --> 27:12.969
Oh, my gosh.

27:12.993 --> 27:15.170
I told him to take
care of himself.

27:18.373 --> 27:20.977
Ease in. Take your
foot off the clutch.

27:21.001 --> 27:22.511
Take your foot off the clutch.

27:22.795 --> 27:23.980
Okay, you're in first. Good.

27:24.004 --> 27:25.263
I'm in second.

27:26.089 --> 27:27.859
- Are you in second?
- I am driving in second.

27:27.883 --> 27:29.486
You've got to stay on
this side of the street.

27:29.510 --> 27:31.186
Be careful! Stop! Stop!

27:32.179 --> 27:33.448
Damn. I messed up the steering.

27:33.472 --> 27:35.742
No, no, no, no. It's all right.
It's all right.

27:35.766 --> 27:37.494
You have to learn one
thing at a time.

27:37.518 --> 27:38.995
That was... That was good.

27:39.019 --> 27:40.237
You sure?

27:40.562 --> 27:42.405
Yeah. Absolutely.

27:42.606 --> 27:45.794
It wasn't too fast. It wasn't too slow.
It was, uh...

27:45.818 --> 27:48.036
Very controlled, sort of.

27:48.111 --> 27:50.956
You didn't kill me. I'm
very proud of you.

27:53.200 --> 27:55.335
Sometimes I can
be pretty stupid.

27:55.953 --> 27:57.671
What do you mean?

27:58.080 --> 28:00.757
Well, I was just thinking.
Were you...

28:02.084 --> 28:03.969
Were you always this great?

28:05.712 --> 28:07.180
Don't.

28:08.173 --> 28:09.933
Don't what?

28:10.759 --> 28:12.477
Oh, you know.

28:12.678 --> 28:14.572
You know exactly
what you're doing.

28:14.596 --> 28:16.439
What am I doing?

28:18.559 --> 28:21.496
So what, now that I have a girlfriend, all
of the sudden you're interested in me?

28:21.520 --> 28:23.915
No. I just... I thought
about it before I knew.

28:23.939 --> 28:28.169
Oh, yeah? Well, you had your chance,
you know, and you blew it big time.

28:28.193 --> 28:29.420
- Okay.
- I mean,

28:29.444 --> 28:30.713
After what you did to me...

28:30.737 --> 28:33.498
Justin, I know, okay? God!
I just thought...

28:33.740 --> 28:35.718
Well, it's not like I had
to force you into this car.

28:35.742 --> 28:37.460
I mean, you knew
what I was asking.

28:38.161 --> 28:41.381
What? You asked me
for driving lessons.

28:41.623 --> 28:43.434
You didn't ask me
out or anything.

28:43.458 --> 28:44.894
Oh, like you didn't know?

28:44.918 --> 28:46.344
I didn't.

28:46.461 --> 28:47.605
Right.

28:47.629 --> 28:51.693
All right, well, I am going out
with Libby right now, okay?

28:51.717 --> 28:53.403
So if these lessons
aren't really lessons...

28:53.427 --> 28:55.071
- They're lessons.
- Oh, okay.

28:55.095 --> 28:57.272
Well, let's just forget
them all the same.

29:07.524 --> 29:09.201
No brothers.

29:09.568 --> 29:10.785
Hmm?

29:11.069 --> 29:12.996
To teach me how to
tie these things.

29:15.115 --> 29:16.541
Could you?

29:16.825 --> 29:19.294
Uh, sure.

29:19.745 --> 29:21.630
I'm Eliza.

29:21.663 --> 29:23.173
Charlie.

29:23.290 --> 29:25.300
- Your first night?
- Yep.

29:25.459 --> 29:27.312
Of waitressing at all.

29:27.336 --> 29:30.514
I never thought I'd resort to
pushing slop for a living.

29:31.006 --> 29:32.567
I mean...

29:32.591 --> 29:34.527
I'm sorry.

29:34.551 --> 29:36.144
No sweat.

29:36.553 --> 29:39.115
This isn't exactly the fulfillment
of a lifelong dream for me either.

29:39.139 --> 29:40.941
No, I do that all the time.

29:40.974 --> 29:43.902
I always offend people I
really want to impress.

29:51.109 --> 29:52.744
You haven't offended me.

29:54.112 --> 29:55.956
The night's young.

29:57.908 --> 30:01.169
At least it is for me.
I'm here till closing.

30:01.328 --> 30:02.639
- Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

30:02.663 --> 30:03.640
Me too.

30:03.664 --> 30:08.885
A workday that ends at midnight, and
then I get to take the bus home.

30:09.294 --> 30:11.064
You didn't drive?

30:11.088 --> 30:14.057
No. Actually, I hoofed it.

30:15.968 --> 30:19.604
Well, I've got a truck here. I
mean, if you need a lift home...

30:21.139 --> 30:23.608
Yeah. Sure. I could use a lift.

30:26.353 --> 30:29.155
- Great.
- Great.

30:48.166 --> 30:49.759
You forgot this.

30:50.877 --> 30:52.429
Thanks.

30:54.631 --> 30:56.641
So how do you think you did?

30:56.925 --> 30:58.435
Okay.

30:59.553 --> 31:02.272
Not as well as you though, huh?

31:04.349 --> 31:06.901
You were done before I even
got to the multiple choice.

31:08.061 --> 31:10.280
You used that test, didn't you?

31:10.480 --> 31:11.865
No.

31:13.150 --> 31:14.877
Maybe for a couple of questions.

31:14.901 --> 31:16.087
God.

31:16.111 --> 31:17.787
What are you thinking?

31:17.821 --> 31:19.956
What, like you've never
bent the rules, Will?

31:22.409 --> 31:24.637
You've stolen food
from the cafeteria.

31:24.661 --> 31:27.756
What? What does that have
to do with anything?

31:27.873 --> 31:30.393
You're the one going nuts over some
girl just because she puts out.

31:30.417 --> 31:32.228
- Don't put it on me.
- Totally out of line.

31:32.252 --> 31:34.689
Fine. Fine. Maybe a
bad choice of words.

31:34.713 --> 31:36.232
It's not the words that
I object to, okay?

31:36.256 --> 31:37.734
I really don't care what
you think of her, but...

31:37.758 --> 31:40.445
- That's lucky, because I have nothing good
to say about her. -You don't even know her!

31:40.469 --> 31:43.364
The more you hang out with her,
the more you get to be like her.

31:43.388 --> 31:45.575
You're just jealous because I
have someone and you don't.

31:45.599 --> 31:47.535
Oh, look, someone like
that I don't need.

31:47.559 --> 31:49.203
Who the hell do you
think you are, Will?

31:49.227 --> 31:51.321
You have no right to talk
about her like that.

31:52.189 --> 31:54.616
So Jill isn't like most girls.
So what?

31:54.858 --> 31:57.702
At least she's interesting.
She's fun.

31:57.861 --> 31:59.756
Not like Isabelle. She
was a total bitch,

31:59.780 --> 32:01.424
but did I go around trashing her?
No.

32:01.448 --> 32:03.801
Because you and I are friends, Will,
and that is not what friends do.

32:03.825 --> 32:06.012
Isabelle wasn't a juvenile
delinquent, okay?

32:06.036 --> 32:07.337
Hey, watch it.

32:08.038 --> 32:10.350
I can't believe you can't see
this girl for what she is.

32:10.374 --> 32:12.101
She's not "interesting," okay?

32:12.125 --> 32:14.135
She is a disaster
waiting to happen.

32:15.087 --> 32:16.513
Go to hell.

32:40.821 --> 32:44.332
You look great. Then
again, when do you not?

32:46.284 --> 32:47.752
Okay, here's the plan.

32:48.453 --> 32:51.339
When you get bored, do
one of these, okay?

32:51.415 --> 32:53.684
That'll be our "let's get the
hell out of here" signal.

32:53.708 --> 32:55.478
I'm not gonna get bored.

32:55.502 --> 32:57.605
I'm looking forward to this.
Really.

32:57.629 --> 33:00.014
Trust me. I've been to a
dozen of these things.

33:00.048 --> 33:02.892
Fifteen minutes in, you'll be
fiddling with your ears like crazy.

33:03.009 --> 33:05.311
We'll cut out. We'll
do something else.

33:05.595 --> 33:06.980
What do you mean?

33:07.139 --> 33:08.866
You like jazz?

33:08.890 --> 33:11.359
I know this great jazz
place in North Beach.

33:15.230 --> 33:17.323
Ben, I live with someone.

33:17.899 --> 33:19.909
You know that. You met him.

33:21.945 --> 33:24.330
I live with him
because I love him.

33:31.496 --> 33:33.798
It's... It's this
one right here.

33:35.709 --> 33:38.803
See? I told you it was
a crummy building.

33:40.881 --> 33:44.100
It's not crummy. All it needs
is a little love and care.

33:44.176 --> 33:46.144
Well, don't we all?

33:48.180 --> 33:51.149
It's much nicer inside.
Do you want to see?

33:51.183 --> 33:54.277
Unless there's someone
waiting at home for you.

34:13.079 --> 34:14.797
I called the restaurant.

34:15.331 --> 34:17.550
I had something to
talk to you about.

34:17.792 --> 34:19.594
Uh-huh.

34:20.587 --> 34:23.181
They said you left
with a waitress.

34:24.591 --> 34:26.226
Yeah, I did.

34:27.844 --> 34:29.478
You want to tell me why?

34:30.804 --> 34:32.607
She needed a lift home.

34:33.934 --> 34:35.902
Who better, huh?

34:41.775 --> 34:43.827
What are you doing, Charlie?

34:44.945 --> 34:46.538
Are you punishing me?

34:49.783 --> 34:51.668
I wanted to, yeah.

34:54.454 --> 34:59.342
I got her all the way home, and...
I came this close.

35:02.003 --> 35:04.180
You know, it would've
been so easy.

35:05.006 --> 35:07.433
Just switch on
over to autopilot.

35:10.679 --> 35:12.730
I really wanted to
get you off my mind,

35:13.390 --> 35:15.942
because I'm clearly
not on yours.

35:17.894 --> 35:19.737
- Charlie...
- But I couldn't, okay?

35:20.730 --> 35:21.874
I didn't.

35:21.898 --> 35:23.491
I didn't do anything.

35:24.025 --> 35:26.828
- Charlie...
- Could we just... Not?

35:43.295 --> 35:44.855
- Claudia!
- What are you doing?

35:44.879 --> 35:46.723
Nothing. Just leave me alone.

35:48.049 --> 35:49.235
Claud, get inside here, now.

35:49.259 --> 35:51.320
What's she doing? Honey,
you'll catch pneumonia.

35:51.344 --> 35:52.562
That's perfect.

35:56.433 --> 35:58.452
No, don't make me
go back inside.

35:58.476 --> 36:00.997
Please, please, please, please,
please, please, please, please.

36:01.021 --> 36:02.707
Let me stay out here
the rest of the night.

36:02.731 --> 36:05.167
Claudia, calmly for a sec,
tell us what's wrong.

36:05.191 --> 36:06.544
I did a really bad thing.

36:06.568 --> 36:09.162
I made Artie sick, and now he
can't do the part of Oliver.

36:09.195 --> 36:11.956
I stole it from him. It
didn't belong to me,

36:12.240 --> 36:13.759
so I need to suffer for it.

36:13.783 --> 36:16.804
Like the Bible says,
an eye for an eye.

36:16.828 --> 36:18.222
Claud, you're being ridiculous.

36:18.246 --> 36:22.550
That's easy for you to say. I mean, you've
never been consumed by jealousy before.

36:22.959 --> 36:26.897
I don't deserve to perform. I
deserve to get pneumonia and die.

36:26.921 --> 36:29.400
Come on. Out of the bucket.

36:29.424 --> 36:30.683
It's terrible, Charlie.

36:30.759 --> 36:34.062
It takes hold of your heart, and it turns
you into someone you don't even recognize,

36:34.387 --> 36:36.814
someone mean and
cold and selfish.

36:38.767 --> 36:42.070
Envy's a sin and I'm a sinner!

36:44.689 --> 36:46.407
Oh, be back in one sec.

36:46.650 --> 36:49.035
- Julia!
- Hi.

36:49.819 --> 36:52.506
So now you know... about Justin.

36:52.530 --> 36:55.926
Yeah, Lib. That's great. You guys...
You seem really great together.

36:55.950 --> 36:57.418
I know.

36:57.869 --> 37:00.380
Want to know what he
calls me sometimes?

37:00.830 --> 37:02.298
"Ybbil."

37:02.582 --> 37:04.393
It's Libby, but backwards.

37:04.417 --> 37:06.395
Oh. That's cute.

37:06.419 --> 37:08.064
Hey, we should all do something.

37:08.088 --> 37:10.107
Me, Justin, and
you and that guy?

37:10.131 --> 37:11.442
Oh. No.

37:11.466 --> 37:14.070
That guy... That, um...
That's not gonna happen.

37:14.094 --> 37:15.603
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

37:15.762 --> 37:18.366
Oh. Well, who needs him, right?

37:18.390 --> 37:20.274
You could still hang out
with me and Justin.

37:21.309 --> 37:23.245
I don't know. I don't think...

37:23.269 --> 37:25.539
In fact, why don't you come with
us to Film Society tonight?

37:25.563 --> 37:26.624
I don't know.

37:26.648 --> 37:28.449
Oh, come on. It'll be fun.

37:28.817 --> 37:31.420
You know what, Lib? You and
Justin should go alone.

37:31.444 --> 37:34.706
I mean, three really is a crowd.

37:38.284 --> 37:39.752
Hey.

37:42.038 --> 37:43.840
Good news.

37:44.708 --> 37:46.467
Wow, an A.

37:46.710 --> 37:48.553
Congratulations.

37:49.504 --> 37:51.472
All thanks to you.

37:51.965 --> 37:53.683
Yeah, well...

37:54.676 --> 37:56.936
How did Will do?

37:57.512 --> 37:59.907
Uh, I don't know.

37:59.931 --> 38:02.150
We're not really...

38:02.475 --> 38:04.277
You were in a fight?

38:04.644 --> 38:06.446
Something like that.

38:06.521 --> 38:08.489
Because of me, right?

38:10.066 --> 38:13.369
So I... I chased off
your best friend.

38:13.778 --> 38:15.872
Hey, who needs him?

38:16.489 --> 38:18.124
Yeah.

38:18.366 --> 38:20.001
You got me.

38:21.077 --> 38:23.046
I'll be your best friend.

38:23.413 --> 38:25.131
- Right.
- Yeah.

38:25.165 --> 38:28.686
We can trade baseball cards.
Go to 'Niner games.

38:28.710 --> 38:30.887
We could look at
girlie magazines.

38:32.464 --> 38:33.931
You won't even miss him.

38:34.007 --> 38:35.266
Right.

38:36.593 --> 38:39.687
I don't know what his problem is.
I mean, he doesn't even know you.

38:41.723 --> 38:43.200
Come on. Let's get out of here.

38:43.224 --> 38:44.618
Okay. Just a sec.

38:44.642 --> 38:45.902
Okay.

38:57.405 --> 38:59.040
Break a leg.

38:59.407 --> 39:01.667
Oh, Artie, what did I do to you?

39:01.785 --> 39:04.253
You left me out in the
cold and rain, remember?

39:04.746 --> 39:06.265
I'm not gonna do it, Artie.

39:06.289 --> 39:08.976
I can't go on. I don't
deserve to be Oliver.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.426
No, you don't.

39:11.044 --> 39:12.772
I'm such a bad person.

39:12.796 --> 39:14.263
Yeah, well,

39:14.464 --> 39:16.849
I'm not so perfect
either, you know.

39:18.760 --> 39:21.187
I kind of lied to you.
At the tryouts,

39:21.596 --> 39:24.148
Mrs. Cooper-Stabler
didn't really beg.

39:25.266 --> 39:26.692
What?

39:27.227 --> 39:30.905
Well, you just looked so
cool up there, singing,

39:31.314 --> 39:33.157
and I guess I got jealous too.

39:33.441 --> 39:35.785
So you stole my part. Big whoop.

39:36.069 --> 39:37.755
I almost killed you.

39:37.779 --> 39:40.373
Aw, lighten up, already.
It's just a virus.

39:40.698 --> 39:43.668
It's the same thing the other Oliver
had, and he's almost all better.

39:44.869 --> 39:49.048
Does that mean he'll be able to
do next weekend's performances?

39:49.582 --> 39:51.134
He might.

39:52.627 --> 39:54.512
But what if I'm better?

39:55.129 --> 39:57.399
What if I just do such a great
job, that they can't even...?

39:57.423 --> 39:58.933
Claudia!

40:11.646 --> 40:13.948
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

40:14.274 --> 40:16.868
- The sample tests are...
- Oh, yeah.

40:20.113 --> 40:21.414
How does it look?

40:22.240 --> 40:24.718
Oh, the test is easy.
It's the driving part.

40:24.742 --> 40:26.136
Oh.

40:26.160 --> 40:27.962
I think you'll do fine.

40:28.079 --> 40:31.299
Yeah, well, if I do, I've
got you to thank for it.

40:32.250 --> 40:34.093
It was no problem.

40:34.669 --> 40:37.138
Yeah, well, you
didn't need to do it.

40:37.422 --> 40:38.890
I know.

40:44.679 --> 40:46.731
I should probably go.

40:47.765 --> 40:52.361
Justin, wait. Um, I just wanted to tell
you that I'm really happy for you.

40:54.397 --> 40:57.459
Libby and you. I mean, I'm really
glad that you found each other,

40:57.483 --> 41:02.413
and that you found out that you
really, uh... That you really...

41:09.954 --> 41:11.505
Like each other.

41:13.374 --> 41:15.134
Oh, God.

41:16.127 --> 41:17.678
I gotta go.

41:31.601 --> 41:33.236
Hi.

41:33.978 --> 41:36.030
You got a couple calls.

41:36.940 --> 41:38.366
Did I?

41:38.858 --> 41:40.618
Your mom,

41:41.194 --> 41:43.663
and Jerry Katz.

41:45.907 --> 41:49.043
Kass. My new advisor.

41:52.205 --> 41:55.841
The evening last night, Ben
did want it to be a date.

41:56.876 --> 42:00.137
As soon as I realized what he was
thinking, I made him take me home.

42:03.508 --> 42:05.351
So I thought you should know.

42:06.803 --> 42:08.354
Know what?

42:09.222 --> 42:11.983
That you put me through all this for
nothing? That I was right all along?

42:13.017 --> 42:14.495
You may have been
right about him,

42:14.519 --> 42:17.113
but you were wrong about me, and
I'm the one you have to trust.

42:20.024 --> 42:23.744
Look, we finally have
something really good here

42:24.779 --> 42:27.623
and we have to figure out
a way to hang on to it.

42:30.785 --> 42:33.587
This isn't the last time that
a guy's gonna be interested,

42:34.288 --> 42:37.717
and you can't go driving waitresses
home every time this happens.

42:39.752 --> 42:41.929
You've got to find
a way to trust me.
