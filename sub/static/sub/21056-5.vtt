my...bright child of...

17:37.752 --> 17:40.363
the lighthouse.
- Oh, my God.

17:40.407 --> 17:42.322
Okay, um...

17:42.365 --> 17:44.106
This is a cult.

17:44.150 --> 17:46.630
Yeah, I fell for a fucking cult!

17:46.674 --> 17:49.242
- No, no, no, no,
how could this be a cult

17:49.285 --> 17:51.983
if I bring you
so much harmony?

17:52.027 --> 17:54.638
- [shouting] Do I look
motherfucking harmonious?

17:54.682 --> 17:56.858
- Go...to your lighthouse.

17:56.901 --> 17:58.599
- [mockingly] Your lighthouse.
Go to your light--

17:58.642 --> 18:00.775
[shouting] You go to your
fucking lighthouse, Boshka!

18:00.818 --> 18:04.605
Oh, my God, he almost convinced
me to leave "Modern Family."

18:04.648 --> 18:06.259
- What?
- Giving up your

18:06.302 --> 18:07.738
material possessions...

18:07.782 --> 18:09.175
will lead
you to enlightenment.

18:09.218 --> 18:11.655
- Uh-huh!
Yeah, okay, so the Lamborghini

18:11.699 --> 18:13.570
that I bought the "Church..."

18:13.614 --> 18:15.311
was that a material possession?

18:15.355 --> 18:18.053
- Jesse, I explained to you
at the dealership

18:18.097 --> 18:21.752
that the Lamborghini is
the vehicle to the lighthouse.

18:21.796 --> 18:23.667
- Okay, I can't believe
I fucking fell for this.

18:23.711 --> 18:25.234
Um...

18:25.278 --> 18:28.237
You're a crazy person
and you can think twice

18:28.281 --> 18:30.021
about me investing that
yurt colony

18:30.065 --> 18:31.588
in Martha's Vineyard.

18:31.632 --> 18:34.113
- That deposit
is, uh, non-refundable.

18:34.156 --> 18:36.376
- Motherfucker.

18:36.419 --> 18:37.638
[elevator bell dings]

18:37.681 --> 18:40.162
- Phil, my boyfriend...

18:40.206 --> 18:42.425
Ross Matthews
is on his way.

18:42.469 --> 18:45.950
Can you please
send him up for our date?

18:45.994 --> 18:49.258
- You know he's gay, right?

18:49.302 --> 18:52.348
[indistinct chatter]

18:55.177 --> 18:56.961
- Oh, my God, Jesse, hi.
- Hey.

18:57.005 --> 18:58.746
- Are you okay?
- Uh, yeah, I just realized

18:58.789 --> 19:00.269
I've been in a cult
for the past year,

19:00.313 --> 19:02.184
I gave away a huge chunk
of my money,

19:02.228 --> 19:04.099
and I almost ruined
my entire entertainment career.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.622
So, but...
- Bummer.

19:05.666 --> 19:07.407
- Yeah.
- Uh, on a happier note.

19:07.450 --> 19:09.017
I'm really excited
to be on the show.

19:09.060 --> 19:10.758
- Oh, we're so excited
to have you on the show.

19:10.801 --> 19:12.325
- Yeah, I've got a great
Sofia Vergara story.

19:12.368 --> 19:14.283
- Oh, my gosh,
will you do the accent?

19:14.327 --> 19:16.067
- [in Colombian accent] Yes.
- [squeals] That's exciting.

19:16.111 --> 19:17.895
All right, I'll come in
and preinterview you.

19:17.939 --> 19:19.245
- [sighs]

19:19.288 --> 19:21.203
Oh, my God hide me!

19:24.728 --> 19:26.556
- He's gone, Davis.

19:28.341 --> 19:30.865
- Cool, I'll just hide
in my office till he leaves.

19:30.908 --> 19:32.214
[elevator bell dings]

19:34.173 --> 19:36.044
- Oh, Penny, Penny,
we need to talk.

19:36.087 --> 19:38.612
- You ready to do this
or just pretend to do it, babe?

19:38.655 --> 19:40.788
- [stammers] I was just with
Jesse Tyler Ferguson

19:40.831 --> 19:43.573
and I'm thinking
that being in a cult

19:43.617 --> 19:45.793
right now is way hotter
than being pan.

19:45.836 --> 19:47.534
- What are you saying?

19:47.577 --> 19:50.754
- I'm gonna join a cult
and then dramatically escape.

19:50.798 --> 19:52.191
Katie Holmes style.

19:52.234 --> 19:53.627
- Ahh.
- It's good, right?

19:53.670 --> 19:55.237
It's good?
- But--

19:55.281 --> 19:56.847
- But you--
you are a delight.

19:56.891 --> 19:58.806
Thank you.
Thank you so much, okay?

19:58.849 --> 20:00.590
And this is--
This is good.

20:00.634 --> 20:03.767
This is very "Deal or No Deal"
suitcase girl.

20:03.811 --> 20:05.943
I likee.
- Aww.

20:05.987 --> 20:08.990
- Oh, Boshka! Wait up.
- Oh...

20:09.033 --> 20:10.600
Penny, Penny, Penny, Penny,
Penny, Penny, Penny.

20:10.644 --> 20:13.255
I'm so sorry.
- That's okay.

20:13.299 --> 20:14.865
- No, it's not okay.

20:14.909 --> 20:17.564
It's Ross' loss,
but there are plenty

20:17.607 --> 20:20.219
of other gay men pretending
to be pansexual in the sea.

20:20.262 --> 20:23.918
- I don't think that's true.
- No, I don't think so, either.

20:23.961 --> 20:27.269
- But I thank you for trying.
- Oh.

20:27.313 --> 20:29.402
Oh!
This feels like pony.

20:29.445 --> 20:31.752
- [chuckles]
- I hate to break it to you,

20:31.795 --> 20:35.234
but this is straight up
Mexican donkey.

20:36.800 --> 20:38.802
And a little bit of Yak.

20:38.846 --> 20:40.891
[lively trumpet music]
