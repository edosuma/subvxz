00:01.914 --> 00:03.655
- A POP original series.

00:04.787 --> 00:07.746
[lively trumpet music]

00:07.790 --> 00:12.664
â™ª

00:12.708 --> 00:14.101
- So are you excited?

00:14.144 --> 00:15.580
- For my morning meeting?

00:15.624 --> 00:18.148
- No, for your lunch
with Ross Matthews.

00:18.192 --> 00:19.932
- You know, I am.
I think it'll be great

00:19.976 --> 00:21.934
to have a friend
outside of the show.

00:21.978 --> 00:23.980
- Well, are you sure
he wants to be your friend?

00:24.024 --> 00:26.548
Maybe he wants you to invest
in his new alkaline water

00:26.591 --> 00:28.245
delivery system.
- No, I think he wants

00:28.289 --> 00:30.682
to be my friend.
- Or maybe he wants you to be

00:30.726 --> 00:32.510
a partner for his
chinchilla farm.

00:32.554 --> 00:36.558
Or he wants to start a line
of ice skates for babies.

00:36.601 --> 00:39.300
- Are there just Madlibs going
on in your brain all the time?

00:39.343 --> 00:40.344
- Kinda.

00:40.388 --> 00:41.911
- I wanna do a high-four

00:41.954 --> 00:44.000
instead of a high-five
sometimes.

00:44.044 --> 00:46.133
Aliens?
- Hey, guys.

00:46.176 --> 00:48.787
I'm very excited to say
we have a great show tonight.

00:48.831 --> 00:51.181
Jesse Tyler Ferguson
from "Modern Family"

00:51.225 --> 00:52.878
and one of Malik's old clients
is here tonight.

00:52.922 --> 00:55.664
- He is so great.
So down to Earth.

00:55.707 --> 00:58.754
- The busty Latin one
on that show makes me laugh.

00:58.797 --> 01:01.670
- Sofia Vergara?
- Is that who plays Manny?

01:01.713 --> 01:04.151
- We also have Michael Strahan.
He's back.

01:04.194 --> 01:06.414
So that's super exciting.
[all groan]

01:06.457 --> 01:08.546
- What's wrong with Strahan?
He seems awesome.

01:08.590 --> 01:10.505
- [dryly] Yeah, he's awesome.
Can't wait to produce that.

01:10.548 --> 01:13.073
Oh, all right, guys,
let's have a fun show.

01:13.116 --> 01:15.075
Okay? Bye-bye.

01:16.424 --> 01:18.208
- Staci?
- Yeah?

01:18.252 --> 01:20.297
- You know how--unlike you,
I play it pretty cool

01:20.341 --> 01:22.212
in front of the celebrities?
- So you've been telling me.

01:22.256 --> 01:24.954
- Well, I have to say,
I'm a huge Michael Strahan fan.

01:24.997 --> 01:26.738
This might sound crazy,
but I think

01:26.782 --> 01:29.306
he and I could be friends.
- I think you could, too.

01:29.350 --> 01:31.874
In fact, Davis, why don't you
produce his segment?

01:31.917 --> 01:33.441
- I was gonna push for that,

01:33.484 --> 01:34.746
but didn't want to step
on your toes.

01:34.790 --> 01:37.314
- Oh, by all means.
It's yours.

01:37.358 --> 01:39.403
- Thank you, Staci.
- Yeah.

01:39.447 --> 01:41.144
I know you and I don't always
see eye-to-eye--

01:41.188 --> 01:43.103
- No, we don't.
- True.

01:43.146 --> 01:45.627
But, um, this is a classy move
and it doesn't go unnoticed.

01:45.670 --> 01:47.281
- [lightly chuckles]

01:47.324 --> 01:48.586
- Maybe he'll sign
his rookie card for me.

01:48.630 --> 01:50.153
[laughs] Oh, my God.

01:50.197 --> 01:53.287
- Maybe.
- But, Staci, Michael Strahan--

01:54.766 --> 01:56.768
- Ugh.
Who are you, Kylie Jenner?

01:56.812 --> 01:59.119
- [laughs]
- That's not a compliment.

02:01.425 --> 02:05.516
- From Studio 9B
in the heart of New York City,

02:05.560 --> 02:08.040
it's "Nightcap with Jimmy."

02:08.084 --> 02:10.956
Tonight, the only man your mom
wants to wake up to,

02:11.000 --> 02:12.828
Michael Strahan.

02:12.871 --> 02:15.439
He has three names
and isn't a serial killer,

02:15.483 --> 02:17.876
it's Jesse Tyler Ferguson.

02:17.920 --> 02:20.140
He's back to nail you
with comedy,

02:20.183 --> 02:22.185
Todd the Tool.

02:22.229 --> 02:25.014
And now,
number five in the ratings,

02:25.057 --> 02:26.581
but number one in our hearts,

02:26.624 --> 02:28.931
here's Jimmy.

02:28.974 --> 02:31.412
[energetic brass music]

02:31.455 --> 02:33.849
- [laughs]
- So I said--I go,

02:33.892 --> 02:37.113
"Matty, I'll have
another glass of 'Cabaret'"

02:37.157 --> 02:38.419
- "Cabaret"
instead of Cabernet?

02:38.462 --> 02:40.682
- Yes!
- [laughs]

02:40.725 --> 02:42.336
- I knew you would love that.
I knew it.

02:42.379 --> 02:44.164
- Cobb salad, sub soy bacon,
dressing on the side.

02:44.207 --> 02:46.644
- That's me.
- So you must be...

02:46.688 --> 02:48.298
fried chicken and waffles
already in a to-go box?

02:48.342 --> 02:51.867
- Yes.

02:51.910 --> 02:53.782
Anyway,
that way if Penny calls--

02:53.825 --> 02:55.175
You know,
it's just easier.

02:55.218 --> 02:56.611
- I get that.
You're a working girl.

02:56.654 --> 02:57.960
I can respect that.
- Thank you.

02:58.003 --> 03:00.310
- Yas, queen.
[snapping fingers]

03:00.354 --> 03:01.877
Right?
- I don't know.

03:01.920 --> 03:03.270
- I don't know.
Am I even doing that right?

03:03.313 --> 03:05.010
- [laughs]
I don't know.

03:05.054 --> 03:06.882
- It's like I don't know what's
cool or what's what

03:06.925 --> 03:09.885
until it's already dead.
Like, MySpace, dead.

03:09.928 --> 03:12.496
Vine, dead.
- Zsa Zsa Gabor, dead.

03:12.540 --> 03:15.543
- I--Okay, I don't quite
get that one,

03:15.586 --> 03:17.197
but, yeah,
sure.

03:17.240 --> 03:19.199
Seriously, though, Staci,
I felt like being gay

03:19.242 --> 03:20.722
used to be so cutting edge.

03:20.765 --> 03:22.071
You know, I was like
on the outskirts.

03:22.114 --> 03:23.638
I was a rebel,
you know?

03:23.681 --> 03:25.205
- Yeah.
- I was a bad boy.

03:25.248 --> 03:27.946
- Yes.
- But now being gay is just...

03:27.990 --> 03:30.166
it's like old hat, right?
- Yeah.

03:30.210 --> 03:32.255
- Which brings me to the whole
purpose of this lunch.

03:32.299 --> 03:33.996
- Yeah.

03:34.039 --> 03:36.955
- I think we should be
in a relationship.

03:36.999 --> 03:39.610
Like a real relationship.

03:39.654 --> 03:41.046
A fake relationship...

03:41.090 --> 03:44.354
but a real fake relationship.

03:44.398 --> 03:47.879
- But I'm--and you're--

03:47.923 --> 03:49.533
I was having a relationship with

03:49.577 --> 03:51.666
my Hollywood agents,
you know and they were sort of

03:51.709 --> 03:55.713
advising me that it would be
beneficial for my career

03:55.757 --> 03:59.282
if I was perceived
as pansexual.

03:59.326 --> 04:02.981
- Like fake girlfriend
to fake pansexual...

04:03.025 --> 04:05.419
homosexual man?
- Yes...

04:05.462 --> 04:06.811
- And you're perfect.
- Oh.

04:06.855 --> 04:08.335
- You are perfect for it!
- Well...

04:08.378 --> 04:10.293
- No, you are.
- I mean, I'm no starlet.

04:10.337 --> 04:12.513
I don't know why you'd pick me.
- You got good hair.

04:12.556 --> 04:14.166
- Oh.
- Even at your age,

04:14.210 --> 04:15.559
you still look--
You know, you look--you look...

04:15.603 --> 04:17.213
pretty good. Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.998
- And people would believe
that you would be

04:20.042 --> 04:21.826
desperate enough
to date someone me.

04:21.870 --> 04:24.220
- I guess I could try.
I mean, I just--

04:24.264 --> 04:27.789
- I knew you were my girl!
- [gasps] Your girl.

04:27.832 --> 04:30.139
Ooh, makes me feel
like high school.

04:30.182 --> 04:31.923
He was gay then, too,
but I didn't know that.

04:31.967 --> 04:34.535
- Oh, perfect! Perfect!
You're my girl.

04:34.578 --> 04:37.233
I don't wanna rush you
into anything too soon, okay?

04:37.277 --> 04:38.495
- Mm-hmm.
- All right?

04:38.539 --> 04:40.932
Um, but I did call
the paparazzi.

04:40.976 --> 04:42.282
Fellas.

04:42.325 --> 04:44.545
Hi.
- Oh.

04:44.588 --> 04:46.373
- Honey, is a fake kiss
from a straight lady

04:46.416 --> 04:48.418
too much for this homo
to hope for?

04:48.462 --> 04:50.768
- Sure! Yes! Okay. All right.
- Okay? Okay.

04:50.812 --> 04:52.727
All right, so why don't you--
Let's see...

04:52.770 --> 04:54.032
- [clears throat]
- You place your hand right here

04:54.076 --> 04:55.643
on my shoulder.
- Okay.

04:55.686 --> 04:56.731
- Okay, but lightly, dear...
- Oh, I'm sorry.

04:56.774 --> 04:58.428
- You're not arresting me.

04:58.472 --> 05:02.302
And then I'm going to place
my hand here.

05:02.345 --> 05:03.738
- Uh-huh.
- And then we'll just sort of

05:03.781 --> 05:06.436
move in here a little--
Okay, no tongue.

05:06.480 --> 05:08.482
- Oh.
- Okay.

05:08.525 --> 05:12.137
[camera shutters clicking]

05:12.181 --> 05:13.661
Mm-hmm. Okay?
- Oh.

05:13.704 --> 05:15.271
- Oh.
- Thank you so much.

05:15.315 --> 05:16.925
Thanks, fellas. Thank you.
- Oh, gosh.

05:16.968 --> 05:19.362
- So, we'll just, um,
we'll do that like, um...

05:19.406 --> 05:20.798
couple times a week
for a couple months?

05:22.147 --> 05:24.106
Think about it.

05:24.149 --> 05:26.761
[elevator bell dings]

05:26.804 --> 05:29.938
- Hi.
- Oh, hello.

05:29.981 --> 05:31.809
- I'm Jesse and I'm here
for the show.

05:31.853 --> 05:33.463
- Oh, yeah,
you're on the list.

05:33.507 --> 05:35.117
- Great.
- But you don't have a plus-one,

05:35.160 --> 05:38.250
so beat it, hippie.
- No, no, no, um...

05:38.294 --> 05:40.601
He has to stay with me.
Okay?

05:40.644 --> 05:43.255
[stammers]
If he doesn't stay with me,

05:43.299 --> 05:45.562
it's gonna be a situation with--

05:45.606 --> 05:47.216
- Jesse, welcome.

05:47.259 --> 05:49.392
I'm Davis Maxfield,
the new talent producer.

05:49.436 --> 05:51.394
The network sent me here to--
- That's great. Um...

05:51.438 --> 05:54.049
so your security guard says
that I don't have a plus-one?

05:54.092 --> 05:56.051
Have to have a plus-one.

05:56.094 --> 05:57.357
What do you not understand
about that?

05:57.400 --> 05:59.402
I have to--
[exhales deeply]

05:59.446 --> 06:02.362
Thank you. Thank you.
Um, I apologize for my tone.

06:02.405 --> 06:05.930
Um, that was unprofessional.
This is Boshka.

06:05.974 --> 06:07.715
He's my guru.
I met him on the set

06:07.758 --> 06:10.065
of "Modern Family" last year
and he's very dear to me

06:10.108 --> 06:12.023
and he keeps me
in my emotional light,

06:12.067 --> 06:14.852
so if it's okay,
I'd really appreciate it

06:14.896 --> 06:16.680
if he could stay
in the dressing room with me.

06:16.724 --> 06:18.160
Please.
- Of course, Phil, please

06:18.203 --> 06:20.423
let him in.
- Yo, bro, you do magic?

06:22.164 --> 06:24.296
You know D Blaine?
- No, no, not like--

06:24.340 --> 06:25.733
Have you ever heard of
The Passage?

06:25.776 --> 06:28.953
- Nah.
- Oh.

06:28.997 --> 06:32.435
Maybe that's 'cause The Passage
has been waiting for you.

06:32.479 --> 06:34.176
- What?
- You know what?

06:34.219 --> 06:35.438
Come to my dressing room,
I'm gonna tell you

06:35.482 --> 06:36.700
all about it.
- Yeah.

06:36.744 --> 06:38.049
- Yeah? Okay.
- Yeah.

06:38.093 --> 06:40.400
- Carry me.

06:40.443 --> 06:42.793
Okay, yup.
This way.

06:42.837 --> 06:45.535
- Well, that's a cult.

06:45.579 --> 06:47.276
- No way,
he seemed so nice.

06:47.319 --> 06:48.886
- Yeah, now.

06:48.930 --> 06:50.497
And then he's pumping you
for money,

06:50.540 --> 06:52.455
asking you to cut
off ties with your mom

06:52.499 --> 06:54.196
and then he's telling you
the Lizard Overlord is arriving.

06:54.239 --> 06:56.416
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Like Godzilla?

06:57.373 --> 06:58.983
No, not like Godzilla.

07:04.728 --> 07:06.556
Look, I don't want to
make you talk shop,

07:06.600 --> 07:09.907
but I just have to say,
you're NFL stats are amazing.

07:09.951 --> 07:12.475
How did you perform at such
a high level for so long?

07:12.519 --> 07:14.390
- Well, first of all,
thank you

07:14.434 --> 07:16.958
and, you know, I had to think
bigger than the game.

07:17.001 --> 07:20.004
I had to dig deep
in the strategy.

07:20.048 --> 07:23.268
- Like opposing team's
play books, or game tape?

07:23.312 --> 07:25.488
- Yeah, that was okay,
but no, like war.

07:25.532 --> 07:27.708
The same thing that motivates
a man on the football field,

07:27.751 --> 07:29.492
motivates a man in battle.

07:29.536 --> 07:32.408
- Football as war.
Wow, now that's intense.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.279
- You wanna know intense?

07:34.323 --> 07:36.499
The Falkland War.
That's intensity, my friend.

07:36.543 --> 07:38.283
A lot of people,
they love to get edgy,

07:38.327 --> 07:40.372
they love to try and say
it was a little skirmish.

07:40.416 --> 07:41.722
Au contraie mon frÃ¨re.

07:41.765 --> 07:44.159
It was war.
- Oh, really?

07:44.202 --> 07:46.640
- Oh, yeah, really,
but to understand it all,

07:46.683 --> 07:48.163
you gotta go back
to the beginning.

07:48.206 --> 07:50.513
And it all started 1841,
all right?

07:50.557 --> 07:53.560
The skies are grey, and these
guys, they're out there,

07:53.603 --> 07:57.520
and they are really
ready to fight.

Okay.
That is how, you know,

08:02.569 --> 08:05.310
using crystals,
Boshka is able to connect

08:05.354 --> 08:09.967
all human beings
creating this sort of

08:10.011 --> 08:11.491
inner light harmony
using our hearts as instruments.

08:11.534 --> 08:13.449
- Wow. You cannot
argue with that science.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.190
- No.

08:15.233 --> 08:19.847
Now, Todd, Boshka and I
saw an inner light within you.

08:19.890 --> 08:22.284
Yes, the minute we saw you.

08:22.327 --> 08:24.895
We think you're a love beacon.

08:24.939 --> 08:27.507
Sort of a lighthouse
on the cliff of humanity.

08:27.550 --> 08:29.944
You know?
It's your duty to mankind

08:29.987 --> 08:32.337
to spread that love,
so, that's sort of

08:32.381 --> 08:34.078
part of the step.
It's, you know,

08:34.122 --> 08:36.777
building the next lighthouse
to the next Harmony Ech--

08:36.820 --> 08:38.430
It's confusing, so...
- Mm.

08:38.474 --> 08:42.696
Wow.
- Todd...

08:42.739 --> 08:48.049
â™ª Will you take this crystal
and spread your light? â™ª

08:48.092 --> 08:52.488
- â™ª Yeah, sure

08:52.532 --> 08:55.230
[lively trumpet music]

08:56.144 --> 08:58.842
- How'd it go
with Ross Matthews?

08:58.886 --> 09:00.235
- Ugh.

09:00.278 --> 09:01.715
- Did he wanna be your friend?

09:01.758 --> 09:04.326
- [sighs]
He wants me to be his beard.

09:04.369 --> 09:06.284
- Really? Why?
- Why?!

09:06.328 --> 09:10.375
Because I'm a beautiful,
sexy, successful woman.

09:10.419 --> 09:12.856
- [chuckles]
- And he wants everyone to think

09:12.900 --> 09:15.816
he's pansexual so he can
open up his fan base.

09:15.859 --> 09:19.210
[scoffs]
God, the kiss was so awkward.

09:19.254 --> 09:21.604
- As awkward as when you
made out with Bindi Irwin's

09:21.648 --> 09:24.128
Komodo Dragon?

09:24.172 --> 09:26.740
- I told you to never
make that face.

09:26.783 --> 09:28.742
You know what I'm gonna do?

09:28.785 --> 09:30.395
I'm gonna call him up

09:30.439 --> 09:32.397
and I'm just gonna
let him down gently.

09:32.441 --> 09:33.877
- You can do what I did
in high school

09:33.921 --> 09:35.749
and tell him you have mono.

09:35.792 --> 09:37.620
- Penny,
I'm not in high school.

09:37.664 --> 09:40.275
- You're absolutely right.
Uh, what about fibromyalgia?

09:40.318 --> 09:43.365
Or, um, lupus!
Or mesothelioma!

09:43.408 --> 09:47.238
- Why do I have to tell him
I have any of those things?

09:47.282 --> 09:49.763
- You're right.
Way too showy.

09:49.806 --> 09:52.026
Guess you gotta pull
the gonorrhea card.

09:52.069 --> 09:53.941
- I'm gonna say,
"I'm a successful woman

09:53.984 --> 09:56.073
and I'm very busy."

09:56.117 --> 09:59.773
But I will keep gonorrhea
in my back pocket.

10:02.645 --> 10:05.430
[lively trumpet music]

10:05.474 --> 10:06.562
- So say this with me, now.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.912
These are...

10:08.956 --> 10:12.089
- The Falkland Islands.
- [chuckles] Thumbs up to you.

10:12.133 --> 10:15.092
And these are...
- The Georgia Islands.

10:15.136 --> 10:16.746
- Which makes the pretzels...

10:16.790 --> 10:18.443
- The...

10:18.487 --> 10:20.358
Um...

10:20.402 --> 10:23.144
- The South Sandwich Islands!
We went over this, man.

10:23.187 --> 10:26.103
Come on, this is technically
two separate territories

10:26.147 --> 10:28.105
lumped together
in the same war.

10:28.149 --> 10:30.151
I mean,
these were wild times.

10:30.194 --> 10:31.543
I'm serious.

10:31.587 --> 10:34.198
April 2nd, 1982,

10:34.242 --> 10:35.939
that's when things really start
to get interesting.

10:35.983 --> 10:39.508
- Promise?
- [laughs] Oh, yeah.

10:39.551 --> 10:41.858
[lively trumpet music]

10:41.902 --> 10:43.643
[sitar music]

10:43.686 --> 10:47.734
- Boshka is serenity.
Boshka is inner and outer peace.

10:47.777 --> 10:50.258
His calmness is empowering,
you know?

10:50.301 --> 10:52.216
- Mm.
- If you could just listen

10:52.260 --> 10:53.783
to him--I know, I know he's not
talking, but if you could listen

10:53.827 --> 10:56.612
with your--with your heart,
he's gonna get you

10:56.656 --> 10:58.570
where you need to be.
- [laughs]

10:58.614 --> 11:01.138
You know, before Davis said
he thought this was a cult.

11:01.182 --> 11:02.487
- What?
[both laugh]

11:02.531 --> 11:05.577
- No. No.
No, no.

11:05.621 --> 11:07.797
I'm a mainstream,
down-to-earth,

11:07.841 --> 11:09.712
relatable television
personality.

11:09.756 --> 11:12.280
So I think I'm--
I think I'd be smart enough

11:12.323 --> 11:13.542
to know if I was
in a cult, you know?

11:13.585 --> 11:15.196
- Totally. Totally.

11:15.239 --> 11:18.155
- Hey, I think I can actually
feel it working.

11:18.199 --> 11:20.462
- Right here.
Right here.

11:20.505 --> 11:22.725
- Oh, hey,

11:22.769 --> 11:24.945
you guys are hanging out
with rocks on your forehead?

11:24.988 --> 11:26.903
Can I play?
- Uh, actually, we--

11:26.947 --> 11:28.775
we don't have anymore
floor space, so...

11:28.818 --> 11:31.560
- I don't mind standing.
- No.

11:31.603 --> 11:33.954
- I can--
- We need the airspace as well.

11:33.997 --> 11:35.782
No.

11:35.825 --> 11:38.741
- Oh, my God, are you
kicking me out of the cult?

11:38.785 --> 11:40.395
- It's not a cu--
[groans]

11:40.438 --> 11:42.571
- This is just like
my eighth birthday party

11:42.614 --> 11:44.616
all over again.

11:44.660 --> 11:47.184
We were on vacation
in Waco.

11:48.490 --> 11:50.579
- Hey, what are those?

11:50.622 --> 11:53.364
- Flowers from Ross.
- [gasps]

11:53.408 --> 11:55.279
Are those "no hard feelings"
flowers?

11:55.323 --> 11:57.281
God, he's so gay and classy!

11:57.325 --> 11:59.414
- Actually, they're for me.
[laughs]

11:59.457 --> 12:01.416
Can you believe it?

12:01.459 --> 12:03.113
- I can't believe it.

12:03.157 --> 12:04.898
Why are they for you?

12:04.941 --> 12:08.902
- He wants me to be his beard.
Isn't that so fun?

12:08.945 --> 12:12.514
- So fun!
- Ooh, there's a card.

12:12.557 --> 12:15.343
"Dear Penny,
au bon pain?

12:15.386 --> 12:17.388
"More like we be pan...

12:17.432 --> 12:19.260
sexual!"
[gasps] Oh, my God,

12:19.303 --> 12:21.741
there's an "XOXO."

12:21.784 --> 12:23.917
Staci, are you
not okay with this?

12:23.960 --> 12:25.266
- I'm totally fine with it.

12:25.309 --> 12:27.181
I'm the one
who gave him the boot.

12:27.224 --> 12:29.574
- Because if you're not
okay with this, I won't do it.

12:29.618 --> 12:32.490
It'll be just like that time you
told me to pretend to be deaf

12:32.534 --> 12:34.188
when George Clooney was around
so that you would be

12:34.231 --> 12:36.277
the only woman in the office
to talk to.

12:36.320 --> 12:38.540
- Penny, I'm the one
that wanted out of this, okay?

12:38.583 --> 12:40.890
So go ahead and fake date him.
- Really?

12:40.934 --> 12:43.937
- Yes! Go fake date him.
Go fake make out.

12:43.980 --> 12:46.766
Go fake make love. Fake marry.
Fake fake fake fake fake.

12:46.809 --> 12:48.942
- Oh, my God!
Thank you!

12:48.985 --> 12:50.682
- Do me a favor,
get the flowers out of here.

12:50.726 --> 12:53.685
You know, my allergies.
- Oh, my God, of course.

12:55.644 --> 12:57.472
- [sarcastically]
Oh, my God, Penny, wait,

12:57.515 --> 12:59.691
this is so terrible.
Something happened to the card.

12:59.735 --> 13:01.781
[babbling]

13:03.304 --> 13:07.395
[lively trumpet music]

13:07.438 --> 13:09.614
- That's good.

13:09.658 --> 13:11.268
I know what you're thinking.

13:11.312 --> 13:14.184
You're thinking
this is ridiculous, right?

13:14.228 --> 13:16.926
- Oh, my gosh,
I'm so glad you said that

13:16.970 --> 13:19.407
because what am I wearing,
right?

13:19.450 --> 13:21.626
- It's terrible.
- Terrible!

13:21.670 --> 13:23.411
- How's anybody supposed
to believe

13:23.454 --> 13:25.935
that you're Lieutenant General
Leopoldo Galtieri

13:25.979 --> 13:29.243
if you're missing two signets
on your lapel, man?

13:29.286 --> 13:31.375
- Yeah, totally.

13:31.419 --> 13:33.334
- You know what?
Now as I was saying,

13:33.377 --> 13:36.685
neither country declared war,
what they did do,

13:36.728 --> 13:39.644
they established
The Red Cross Box.

13:39.688 --> 13:42.647
All this while
they did not declare war,

13:42.691 --> 13:45.172
but you could see,
they acknowledged war.

13:45.215 --> 13:47.914
You agree with that?
- I do agree with that.

13:47.957 --> 13:50.612
You know, Michael,
I'm loving this history

13:50.655 --> 13:52.222
as strategy thing
so much,

13:52.266 --> 13:53.920
I don't think we should
keep it to ourselves.

13:53.963 --> 13:55.573
- Really?
- I know someone

13:55.617 --> 13:57.271
who's an excellent listener.

13:57.314 --> 14:01.971
- [all chanting]
Be the harmony. Be the harmony.

14:02.015 --> 14:04.191
Be the harmony.
- Oh.

14:04.234 --> 14:07.020
- Boshka, I'd like to
introduce you Michael Strahan.

14:07.063 --> 14:08.717
- Hey, Boshka,
how are you?

14:08.760 --> 14:10.327
It's a really cool class
you got going on here.

14:10.371 --> 14:12.590
Really cool.
- [all chanting] Be the harmony.

14:12.634 --> 14:15.419
- You know what else is cool?
The Falkland War.

14:15.463 --> 14:17.247
You know,
during the Falklands War,

14:17.291 --> 14:19.946
Argentinean government--
they banned all English music,

14:19.989 --> 14:21.425
but you know what that did?

14:21.469 --> 14:23.123
It gave rise
to local rock bands.

14:23.166 --> 14:25.995
An unintended,
but very exciting consequence.

14:26.039 --> 14:28.171
- [all chanting]
Be the harmony.

14:28.215 --> 14:29.869
[lively trumpet music]

14:29.912 --> 14:32.741
- Oh, my God.

14:32.784 --> 14:36.005
You look like a Kardashian.
- Thank you.

14:36.049 --> 14:38.007
I went to Marcus
for a little lip gloss

14:38.051 --> 14:40.836
before my big coffee date
with Ross Matthews

14:40.880 --> 14:43.143
and instead he did this.

14:43.186 --> 14:45.449
- Well,
I've been here working.

14:47.016 --> 14:50.628
- What is all of this?
- Well, it is all the writers

14:50.672 --> 14:52.456
from the history of the show
and I need you to put them

14:52.500 --> 14:54.502
all on a hard drive
for the archives.

14:54.545 --> 14:56.721
- But you said we
didn't have to do this anymore.

14:56.765 --> 14:59.289
- Did I?
Well, you do.

14:59.333 --> 15:01.857
- But I have my coffee date
with Ross in half an hour.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.511
- [gasps] Well, you're gonna
have to call him

15:03.554 --> 15:05.469
and tell him
you're gonna be very late.

15:05.513 --> 15:08.342
- Are you trying
to keep me from Ross?

15:08.385 --> 15:10.474
- Of course not.
- Because you said

15:10.518 --> 15:12.346
you were okay with us dating.

15:12.389 --> 15:13.869
- I am okay with you dating.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.740
You just have
to finish your job.

15:15.784 --> 15:18.918
- I'm not cancelling on Ross.
- Oh, why because you

15:18.961 --> 15:20.615
love him so much?

15:20.658 --> 15:22.356
Because you don't wanna miss
your fake date

15:22.399 --> 15:23.966
where you're gonna make
a fake sex tape

15:24.010 --> 15:26.055
and become a fake gazillionaire?

15:26.099 --> 15:27.796
- What if I want that?
Why would you care?

15:27.839 --> 15:30.277
- I don't care.
I don't care at all.

15:30.320 --> 15:32.192
But of all the gay men
in America,

15:32.235 --> 15:35.586
you had to beard mine?
- See! I knew you were mad!

15:35.630 --> 15:38.154
- Damn straight
I was mad!

15:38.198 --> 15:41.679
- Well, why didn't you say so
when I asked you earlier,

15:41.723 --> 15:44.204
"Staci, are you mad?"
- Because...

15:44.247 --> 15:46.423
you should know I'm mad
without me having to tell you.

15:46.467 --> 15:49.078
You should be able to think my
thoughts before I'm able to

15:49.122 --> 15:51.124
- Oh, great. Right.
So even when you mess up,

15:51.167 --> 15:52.603
it's still somehow my fault?

15:52.647 --> 15:54.692
- Well now you're finally
understanding

15:54.736 --> 15:56.172
your position at the show!
- Yeah?

15:56.216 --> 15:57.434
- Yeah!
- Yeah?

15:57.478 --> 15:58.958
- Yeah!
- Yeah, I get it!

15:59.001 --> 16:01.047
All of the blame,
none of the respect!

16:01.090 --> 16:04.789
And if you think
you are gonna break up

16:04.833 --> 16:08.402
this beautiful, fake
pansexual relationship,

16:08.445 --> 16:11.274
then you have got
another thing coming!

16:11.318 --> 16:14.103
To you!

16:14.147 --> 16:15.539
- What are you doing?

16:15.583 --> 16:17.019
- Storming out...

16:17.063 --> 16:20.327
but these shoes
are so high.

16:20.370 --> 16:22.024
Still stormin'!

16:22.068 --> 16:25.027
[lively trumpet music]

16:25.071 --> 16:29.989
- [all chanting] I'm the
lighthouse. I'm the lighthouse.

16:30.032 --> 16:33.427
Be the harmony.
â™ª Be the harmony

16:33.470 --> 16:37.692
- And that, my friend, was
the turning point in the war.

16:37.735 --> 16:38.823
- You know what?
I have to go

16:38.867 --> 16:40.303
talk to the director,

16:40.347 --> 16:41.913
so I'll catch up with you
in a second.

16:41.957 --> 16:43.741
All right, Michael?
- Hm. Sounds good.

16:43.785 --> 16:45.743
But you wanna know one thing?
Really crazy, okay?

16:45.787 --> 16:48.007
Craziest story of all.
The BBC...

16:48.050 --> 16:50.313
they announced the taking
Goose Green on the radio

16:50.357 --> 16:52.141
before it actually happened.
How do you do that?

16:52.185 --> 16:54.187
Is it hubris?
Or...

16:54.230 --> 16:55.797
do you have an inside source?

16:55.840 --> 16:57.755
both: â™ª I am the harmony

16:57.799 --> 17:00.149
- The debate rages on--
- [shouts] Shut up!

17:00.193 --> 17:03.022
Shut the fuck up!

17:03.065 --> 17:05.546
Enough about Argentina

17:05.589 --> 17:07.896
and England
and the fucking islands!

17:07.939 --> 17:11.334
Shut up!
The Falklands War?

17:11.378 --> 17:14.685
It's dumb!
- The Falklands War is not dumb!

17:14.729 --> 17:17.906
You're dumb!
- Oh, and by the way,

17:17.949 --> 17:20.213
you didn't deserve NFC
Defenseman Player of the Year

17:20.256 --> 17:24.478
in 2001 or 2003
because you suck!

17:24.521 --> 17:27.307
Go Pats!
Whoo!

17:27.350 --> 17:30.092
[evil laughter]

17:30.136 --> 17:33.530
[sitar music]

17:33.574 --> 17:37.708
- Wha--What is it...
my...bright child of...

17:37.752 --> 17:40.363
the lighthouse.
- Oh, my God.

17:40.407 --> 17:42.322
Okay, um...

17:42.365 --> 17:44.106
This is a cult.

17:44.150 --> 17:46.630
Yeah, I fell for a fucking cult!

17:46.674 --> 17:49.242
- No, no, no, no,
how could this be a cult

17:49.285 --> 17:51.983
if I bring you
so much harmony?

17:52.027 --> 17:54.638
- [shouting] Do I look
motherfucking harmonious?

17:54.682 --> 17:56.858
- Go...to your lighthouse.

17:56.901 --> 17:58.599
- [mockingly] Your lighthouse.
Go to your light--

17:58.642 --> 18:00.775
[shouting] You go to your
fucking lighthouse, Boshka!

18:00.818 --> 18:04.605
Oh, my God, he almost convinced
me to leave "Modern Family."

18:04.648 --> 18:06.259
- What?
- Giving up your

18:06.302 --> 18:07.738
material possessions...

18:07.782 --> 18:09.175
will lead
you to enlightenment.

18:09.218 --> 18:11.655
- Uh-huh!
Yeah, okay, so the Lamborghini

18:11.699 --> 18:13.570
that I bought the "Church..."

18:13.614 --> 18:15.311
was that a material possession?

18:15.355 --> 18:18.053
- Jesse, I explained to you
at the dealership

18:18.097 --> 18:21.752
that the Lamborghini is
the vehicle to the lighthouse.

18:21.796 --> 18:23.667
- Okay, I can't believe
I fucking fell for this.

18:23.711 --> 18:25.234
Um...

18:25.278 --> 18:28.237
You're a crazy person
and you can think twice

18:28.281 --> 18:30.021
about me investing that
yurt colony

18:30.065 --> 18:31.588
in Martha's Vineyard.

18:31.632 --> 18:34.113
- That deposit
is, uh, non-refundable.

18:34.156 --> 18:36.376
- Motherfucker.

18:36.419 --> 18:37.638
[elevator bell dings]

18:37.681 --> 18:40.162
- Phil, my boyfriend...

18:40.206 --> 18:42.425
Ross Matthews
is on his way.

18:42.469 --> 18:45.950
Can you please
send him up for our date?

18:45.994 --> 18:49.258
- You know he's gay, right?

18:49.302 --> 18:52.348
[indistinct chatter]

18:55.177 --> 18:56.961
- Oh, my God, Jesse, hi.
- Hey.

18:57.005 --> 18:58.746
- Are you okay?
- Uh, yeah, I just realized

18:58.789 --> 19:00.269
I've been in a cult
for the past year,

19:00.313 --> 19:02.184
I gave away a huge chunk
of my money,

19:02.228 --> 19:04.099
and I almost ruined
my entire entertainment career.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.622
So, but...
- Bummer.

19:05.666 --> 19:07.407
- Yeah.
- Uh, on a happier note.

19:07.450 --> 19:09.017
I'm really excited
to be on the show.

19:09.060 --> 19:10.758
- Oh, we're so excited
to have you on the show.

19:10.801 --> 19:12.325
- Yeah, I've got a great
Sofia Vergara story.

19:12.368 --> 19:14.283
- Oh, my gosh,
will you do the accent?

19:14.327 --> 19:16.067
- [in Colombian accent] Yes.
- [squeals] That's exciting.

19:16.111 --> 19:17.895
All right, I'll come in
and preinterview you.

19:17.939 --> 19:19.245
- [sighs]

19:19.288 --> 19:21.203
Oh, my God hide me!

19:24.728 --> 19:26.556
- He's gone, Davis.

19:28.341 --> 19:30.865
- Cool, I'll just hide
in my office till he leaves.

19:30.908 --> 19:32.214
[elevator bell dings]

19:34.173 --> 19:36.044
- Oh, Penny, Penny,
we need to talk.

19:36.087 --> 19:38.612
- You ready to do this
or just pretend to do it, babe?

19:38.655 --> 19:40.788
- [stammers] I was just with
Jesse Tyler Ferguson

19:40.831 --> 19:43.573
and I'm thinking
that being in a cult

19:43.617 --> 19:45.793
right now is way hotter
than being pan.

19:45.836 --> 19:47.534
- What are you saying?

19:47.577 --> 19:50.754
- I'm gonna join a cult
and then dramatically escape.

19:50.798 --> 19:52.191
Katie Holmes style.

19:52.234 --> 19:53.627
- Ahh.
- It's good, right?

19:53.670 --> 19:55.237
It's good?
- But--

19:55.281 --> 19:56.847
- But you--
you are a delight.

19:56.891 --> 19:58.806
Thank you.
Thank you so much, okay?

19:58.849 --> 20:00.590
And this is--
This is good.

20:00.634 --> 20:03.767
This is very "Deal or No Deal"
suitcase girl.

20:03.811 --> 20:05.943
I likee.
- Aww.

20:05.987 --> 20:08.990
- Oh, Boshka! Wait up.
- Oh...

20:09.033 --> 20:10.600
Penny, Penny, Penny, Penny,
Penny, Penny, Penny.

20:10.644 --> 20:13.255
I'm so sorry.
- That's okay.

20:13.299 --> 20:14.865
- No, it's not okay.

20:14.909 --> 20:17.564
It's Ross' loss,
but there are plenty

20:17.607 --> 20:20.219
of other gay men pretending
to be pansexual in the sea.

20:20.262 --> 20:23.918
- I don't think that's true.
- No, I don't think so, either.

20:23.961 --> 20:27.269
- But I thank you for trying.
- Oh.

20:27.313 --> 20:29.402
Oh!
This feels like pony.

20:29.445 --> 20:31.752
- [chuckles]
- I hate to break it to you,

20:31.795 --> 20:35.234
but this is straight up
Mexican donkey.

20:36.800 --> 20:38.802
And a little bit of Yak.

20:38.846 --> 20:40.891
[lively trumpet music]
