Sorry about the false alarm, gang.

00:49.507 --> 00:52.469
Also, sorry about
the three false alarms before that.

00:52.552 --> 00:55.889
Don't apologize. Our baby will come out
when she's good and ready.

00:55.972 --> 00:56.973
Yeah.

00:57.057 --> 01:01.311
Or maybe she won't and you'll become
some kind of folk legend.

01:01.394 --> 01:04.813
♪ But that lady kept on truckin'
And she kept on being pregnant ♪

01:04.897 --> 01:06.566
I really thought this was the one.

01:06.649 --> 01:10.528
I had hopes, too.
Your screams were so unsettling.

01:10.612 --> 01:12.155
Thank you.

01:12.238 --> 01:15.617
Let us know when you're heading back
to the hospital and we'll be there.

01:15.700 --> 01:16.993
I don't want to go back there.

01:17.077 --> 01:19.662
Don't have to go back there
until your water breaks.

01:19.746 --> 01:21.748
I don't want to go back there ever.

01:21.831 --> 01:24.000
How could our doctor retire
a week before my due date?

01:24.584 --> 01:28.963
He didn't retire. He was  retired
by the hospital. For being 85.

01:29.047 --> 01:31.549
And for driving his Cadillac
through the emergency room.

01:31.633 --> 01:34.844
Well, I'm not going back
to that 14-year-old who's on call.

01:34.928 --> 01:37.680
-He called me "the girl who cried baby."
-He was trying to be funny.

01:37.764 --> 01:41.226
Yeah, well, if I want a comedian
to deliver our baby, I'll call Gallagher.

01:41.309 --> 01:43.895
Gallagher's in Cuyahoga Falls this week.

01:43.978 --> 01:47.023
Well, I wish that doctor
was in Cuyahoga Falls this week.

01:47.106 --> 01:48.775
[scoffs] He was so condescending.

01:48.858 --> 01:51.444
-It's like, who does he think he is?
-A medical doctor?

01:51.528 --> 01:54.239
Bud, I will not have our baby there.

01:54.989 --> 01:57.242
Allison, you're frustrated.

01:57.325 --> 02:00.078
-You're hormonal.
-Tread lightly, soldier.

02:00.161 --> 02:02.372
You're beautiful.

02:02.455 --> 02:05.083
But Dr. O'Neill is delivering our baby.

02:05.667 --> 02:07.627
Dr. Puberty isn't coming near our baby.

02:08.044 --> 02:09.711
Allison, you know...

02:09.795 --> 02:13.091
Remember that thing I just said
about light treading to Bud?

02:13.174 --> 02:14.467
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

02:15.051 --> 02:18.138
Recent studies have shown home birth,
done with care,

02:18.221 --> 02:22.225
reduces the risk of infection
and enhances bonding.

02:22.809 --> 02:24.018
-Allison.
-Ooh.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.187
She reads this stuff in a newsletter
that she writes.

02:26.271 --> 02:27.105
I don't care.

02:27.188 --> 02:31.734
The home birth rate has increased
by 30 percent in the last ten years.

02:31.818 --> 02:34.863
And, hey, if it's good enough
for Meryl Streep...

02:35.655 --> 02:37.157
-Meryl?
-That's right.

02:37.240 --> 02:38.741
And guess what else?

02:38.825 --> 02:43.538
You know someone very qualified
and experienced to perform the delivery.

02:43.621 --> 02:46.207
-Meryl?
-No, me.

02:46.666 --> 02:50.587
I've delivered lots of babies in the '60s
and in the early part of the '70s.

02:50.962 --> 02:52.922
Really until the commune disbanded

02:53.006 --> 02:56.301
and Guru Jeff went to jail
for marrying too many ladies.

02:58.970 --> 03:02.140
Frankie... will you deliver my baby?

03:02.724 --> 03:07.353
-Yes, Allison, a thousand times, yes!
-[Allison laughs]

03:07.437 --> 03:08.354
Oh!

03:08.688 --> 03:10.398
You can't be serious.

03:10.481 --> 03:13.234
Serious as a federal polygamy inquest.

03:14.027 --> 03:16.237
I've got to go make a list.

03:16.696 --> 03:18.448
-[Sol clears throat]
-Dad, a little help?

03:18.531 --> 03:20.325
I find it's best

03:20.408 --> 03:23.745
to not get in your mother's way
with this kind of stuff.

03:23.828 --> 03:26.289
Oh, you mean like the birth of my child?

03:26.372 --> 03:29.417
Bud, you need to remember

03:29.500 --> 03:33.796
that this baby is as much your mother's
as it is yours.

03:41.638 --> 03:42.597
Ouch.

03:42.680 --> 03:43.806
[door opens]

03:45.934 --> 03:49.562
-What are you looking for?
-Oh, we need a cord clamp.

03:51.147 --> 03:52.732
[Sol] Wait, a cord clamp?

03:53.858 --> 03:55.568
Do you have a cord clamp?

03:55.902 --> 03:58.613
No, but I have a chip clip.

03:58.696 --> 03:59.530
Ha.

03:59.864 --> 04:03.326
And we need alcohol.
And towels. A lot of towels.

04:03.409 --> 04:05.370
You know, to wipe up the miracle.

04:05.453 --> 04:09.290
We've got plenty of towels at our place.
Robert's a bit of a linen queen.

04:09.374 --> 04:14.170
Perfect. Now where in Helena
did I put my birthing clogs?

04:14.254 --> 04:17.005
Hi, girl. How's tricks?

04:17.089 --> 04:18.925
Grace, why are you sitting on the stairs?

04:19.341 --> 04:20.718
Why do people sit on a couch?

04:20.802 --> 04:24.138
It's just as arbitrary as a good stair-sit
if you think about it.

04:24.222 --> 04:25.556
What's in the backpack?

04:25.640 --> 04:28.101
Stuff. You know, backpack stuff.
[clears throat]

04:29.185 --> 04:30.979
Let me have a little look.

04:31.062 --> 04:34.065
A mug, a teabag, a hot plate,

04:34.148 --> 04:37.819
a kettle, and some homemade trail mix.

04:37.902 --> 04:39.904
I can see what's going on here.

04:39.988 --> 04:42.490
Oh, you always say that
and it's never true.

04:42.573 --> 04:45.410
You wanted a cup of tea in the bath,
you couldn't carry it

04:45.493 --> 04:48.913
because you have to have both hands free
to scoot up the stairs.

04:49.622 --> 04:51.749
Wait, why can't you make it up the stairs?

04:51.833 --> 04:54.627
Because she's having knee replacement
surgery in two days,

04:54.711 --> 04:58.214
and her doctor wants her
to do a full detox.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.550
No booze and no pain pills.

05:00.633 --> 05:01.759
My angels.

05:01.843 --> 05:06.264
Grace, it's not safe for you
to be here by yourself unable to walk.

05:06.347 --> 05:07.557
-[scoffs]
-You know,

05:07.640 --> 05:10.351
Frankie and I are planning on waiting
at my house

05:10.435 --> 05:12.562
until we get the big call from Bud.

05:12.645 --> 05:15.148
I convinced them to have a home birth.

05:15.231 --> 05:17.066
You're not using my towels!

05:17.150 --> 05:18.234
[scoffs]

05:18.318 --> 05:20.570
Of course not. Paranoid.

05:20.653 --> 05:22.530
Why don't you come stay with us?

05:22.613 --> 05:25.825
It'll be the perfect place to detox
before your surgery.

05:25.908 --> 05:27.118
Wow, really?

05:27.201 --> 05:28.411
Oh, thanks.

05:28.494 --> 05:30.621
That sounds absolutely fucking horrible.

05:31.122 --> 05:33.708
He's right. There will be plenty of people
to take care of you

05:33.791 --> 05:35.418
and there are no stairs.

05:35.501 --> 05:36.919
Well, there are two stairs.

05:37.003 --> 05:39.297
All of this worry is unnecessary.

05:39.380 --> 05:43.051
Believe me when I say, leave my house.

05:43.134 --> 05:46.554
Are you gonna make me
miss my grandbaby's birth

05:46.637 --> 05:48.723
because you're being stubborn?

05:49.515 --> 05:52.935
Do you want me
to never speak to you again?

05:54.729 --> 05:55.605
Hmm.

05:55.688 --> 05:56.773
[scoffs]

05:56.856 --> 05:58.858
-Grace?
-Well, I'm... I'm thinking.

05:58.941 --> 06:00.234
Pick her up, Sol.

06:00.693 --> 06:01.778
Frankie, uh...

06:02.570 --> 06:04.322
I'm a 75-year-old man.

06:04.405 --> 06:06.032
Jacob could do it.

06:06.115 --> 06:09.243
Why are you always trying
to drive a wedge between Jacob and me?

06:09.327 --> 06:11.621
I'm fine.
Nick is coming over this afternoon.

06:11.704 --> 06:12.747
Nice try.

06:12.830 --> 06:18.211
We both know that he is in Anaheim
this week buying Walt Disney's head.

06:19.545 --> 06:21.297
Okay, fine.

06:21.380 --> 06:22.924
But Sol's not carrying me.

06:23.007 --> 06:24.300
No problem.

06:24.383 --> 06:26.427
I will get the wheelbarrow.

07:13.891 --> 07:15.476
What, uh... can I do for you?

07:15.560 --> 07:18.271
Actually, I was hoping that we could talk.
May I come in?

07:18.688 --> 07:20.731
-Uh, in here?
-Yes.

07:21.315 --> 07:22.942
-To talk?

07:24.235 --> 07:25.361
Of course.

07:32.994 --> 07:36.289
Sorry for coming over uninvited like this,
but...

07:36.789 --> 07:38.166
Are those jazz shoes?

07:38.249 --> 07:40.626
They're just shoes. I'm the jazz.

07:41.919 --> 07:43.463
How can I help you?

07:43.921 --> 07:46.048
Did something happen
between you and Oliver?

07:46.132 --> 07:48.384
I'm not sure I know what you mean.

07:48.468 --> 07:51.345
It's just...
we had such a great time with you,

07:51.429 --> 07:54.348
and every time I try to get Oliver
to invite you over,

07:54.432 --> 07:55.850
he gets cagey and weird.

07:55.933 --> 07:57.226
It's so unlike him.

07:57.310 --> 08:01.522
So, you were trying to talk to him
about me and Sol?

08:01.606 --> 08:03.816
I did this morning,
but he just stormed off,

08:03.900 --> 08:05.568
said he needed to dance it out.

08:05.943 --> 08:07.528
[chuckles] I've been there.

08:07.945 --> 08:09.197
Robert, what's going on?

08:09.572 --> 08:11.115
You know, I'm not sure that--

08:13.409 --> 08:15.161
-Oh, God.
-Sol!

08:15.786 --> 08:18.789
Look who stopped by,
and we've barely had a chance to speak.

08:18.873 --> 08:22.293
Oh, good. New people.
I'm already glad I came.

08:22.376 --> 08:25.713
Grace, how lovely, and Frankie.
Jo, say hello to Grace and Frankie.

08:25.796 --> 08:27.798
-'Sup.
-Nice to meet you.

08:28.716 --> 08:30.635
To what do I owe this surprise visit?

08:30.718 --> 08:32.845
I was going to ask
the same thing about Jo.

08:33.261 --> 08:37.933
Well, Sol, why don't we get
all our surprise visitors some drinks.

08:38.017 --> 08:40.811
-Can you help me in the kitchen?
-Mind if I tag along?

08:40.895 --> 08:43.731
I need to borrow, and possibly ruin,
all your towels.

08:44.106 --> 08:45.149
Perfect!

08:45.233 --> 08:46.317
Frankie. I...

08:48.861 --> 08:51.948
Lady I don't know, help me to the couch.

08:54.659 --> 08:56.285
-Well, grab my arm!
-Okay.

08:56.369 --> 08:57.870
What is Jo doing here?!

08:57.954 --> 08:59.747
Relax. She doesn't know.

08:59.830 --> 09:02.917
I've got that situation under control.
So, what the hell is Grace doing here?

09:03.000 --> 09:04.168
She's having knee surgery

09:04.252 --> 09:06.796
and I offered her our place
so she could avoid stairs.

09:06.879 --> 09:08.673
Right, her surgery.

09:08.756 --> 09:12.176
Oh, you knew?
I guess you forgot to mention it to me.

09:12.260 --> 09:13.511
I would have, Sol,

09:13.594 --> 09:16.389
but if you're gonna go on cruises
by yourself,

09:16.472 --> 09:17.974
you're gonna miss stuff.

09:20.476 --> 09:22.311
What was I supposed to do?!

09:23.020 --> 09:26.983
Miss a duet
between Joan Baez and Donovan?

09:27.066 --> 09:28.317
Not likely!

09:28.401 --> 09:30.778
I was hoping we could
spend time together tonight.

09:30.861 --> 09:32.697
I wasn't expecting company.

09:32.780 --> 09:35.783
Oh, I'm not company.
I'm a beloved fixture.

09:35.866 --> 09:39.412
[gasps] Oh, these will do!

09:39.495 --> 09:43.040
Sol, what does she want
with my grandmother's tea towels?

09:43.124 --> 09:45.751
Oh, we had a little snafu at the hospital

09:45.835 --> 09:50.339
and Frankie is now going to deliver
Bud and Allison's baby in their apartment.

09:50.423 --> 09:51.966
Absolutely not with these.

09:53.676 --> 09:55.886
-Thanks for the crap.
-You're welcome.

09:55.970 --> 09:58.973
Now, then, Sol, let's make
some Harvey Wallbangers for everyone,

09:59.056 --> 10:00.808
and then we'll send off our guests.

10:00.891 --> 10:02.310
Make mine a virgin.

10:02.393 --> 10:04.437
I can't drink and deliver.

10:04.520 --> 10:06.814
-And Grace can't drink, either.
-Ha! Can you imagine?

10:07.732 --> 10:11.027
No, seriously.
She has to detox before her surgery.

10:11.611 --> 10:12.737
Doctor's orders.

10:13.988 --> 10:16.699
-Robert?
-Sol... you fool!

10:17.533 --> 10:20.036
Forgive them, Father,
for they know not what they do.

10:20.119 --> 10:23.456
-You're scaring me.
-Oh, be afraid. Afraid indeed.

10:23.539 --> 10:27.918
I have only seen Grace not drink
twice in my life.

10:28.002 --> 10:30.379
Once, when we were stranded on a ship
in the Indian Ocean,

10:30.463 --> 10:33.174
and once, when she was pregnant
with Mallory.

10:33.257 --> 10:35.718
What about when she was pregnant
with Brianna?

10:35.801 --> 10:36.636
No.

10:36.719 --> 10:40.139
Friends, let me tell you
what is about to happen here:

10:40.222 --> 10:43.184
the three phases of sober Grace.

10:43.768 --> 10:44.810
I'm hooked.

10:45.394 --> 10:47.521
Phase one: irritability.

10:47.605 --> 10:52.234
The complete loss of all politeness
and all social courtesy.

10:52.902 --> 10:54.487
How will we tell?

10:56.155 --> 10:57.907
I love your little scarf.

10:58.449 --> 11:00.743
It's strong enough to choke a man.

11:03.245 --> 11:04.830
Phase two...

11:05.748 --> 11:06.916
euphoria.

11:07.333 --> 11:10.336
Now this is a tricky one,
because she is so lovely,

11:10.920 --> 11:13.714
and you'll think the worst is over,
but you'll be wrong.

11:13.798 --> 11:17.760
It is just the calm before phase three:
rage.

11:17.843 --> 11:22.056
Pure, unfiltered rage. And you don't want
to be close when it hits.

11:22.139 --> 11:25.810
She will cut to the core of you.
She will mix lies with the truth.

11:25.893 --> 11:27.770
She can't control it. It controls her.

11:27.853 --> 11:29.855
But friends, if you stick with me...

11:30.564 --> 11:32.608
we may just live through this night.

11:33.192 --> 11:34.110
Jesus.

11:34.193 --> 11:36.320
Oh, he can't help you now.

11:36.404 --> 11:37.905
-[door slams]
-[Oliver] Robert!

11:38.781 --> 11:39.907
Who is that?

11:39.990 --> 11:42.201
-Oh, God.
-[Jo] Oliver, what are you doing here?

11:42.284 --> 11:43.452
No, don't.

11:44.995 --> 11:46.080
Robert!

11:47.873 --> 11:49.583
I told you not to talk to her.

11:49.667 --> 11:51.335
Why? What happened between you two?

11:52.420 --> 11:55.005
[sighs]
Robert thinks I shouldn't be marrying you.

11:55.089 --> 11:56.424
What? Why?

11:56.507 --> 11:58.092
Because he thinks I'm gay.

11:58.175 --> 12:02.430
Sol, would you mind taking me back home
or setting me on fire?

12:04.598 --> 12:07.435
Okay, breathe. Just breathe.

12:07.518 --> 12:10.104
Everything's gonna be okay.
Okay, one more big breath.

12:10.187 --> 12:12.022
[inhales]

12:12.106 --> 12:13.983
[exhales]

12:14.733 --> 12:18.404
This is weird. This is wrong. My mother
shanghaied the birth of my child.

12:18.487 --> 12:22.074
It's gonna be fine, man.
People have been born for a long time.

12:22.158 --> 12:23.659
I don't know what that means.

12:24.034 --> 12:25.161
Yeah, that was nonsense.

12:26.245 --> 12:29.081
Bud, doesn't it tell you something

12:29.165 --> 12:32.793
that the most hospital-positive person
in the world is okay with this?

12:33.711 --> 12:36.172
It tells me you may have been
Frankie-Bergsteined.

12:36.255 --> 12:37.923
I know what it's like.

12:38.007 --> 12:39.717
That's how I ended up
with a tattoo on my butt.

12:40.259 --> 12:42.136
Yep. It says "Livin'  La Vida Loca. "

12:42.219 --> 12:44.513
And why both  "vida"  and  "loca"
are misspelled.

12:44.597 --> 12:47.391
Thanks, Mal, and thanks
for bringing the twins' kiddie pool.

12:47.475 --> 12:49.518
-Oh, actually...
-The pool's mine, babe.

12:52.354 --> 12:55.316
So Robert said you're gay. So what?

12:55.399 --> 13:00.029
Honey, if I got upset every time someone
told me you were gay, I'd be upset a lot.

13:00.404 --> 13:01.572
My mother thought he was gay.

13:01.655 --> 13:04.575
That's just because she and I watched
a  Falcon Crest  marathon together.

13:04.658 --> 13:10.414
If loving  Falcon Crest  is gay,
then I'm Rip Taylor and both Indigo Girls.

13:12.041 --> 13:15.085
Look, it's not a big deal.
I know you're not attracted to men.

13:15.169 --> 13:18.005
You know you're not attracted to men.
What does it matter?

13:18.088 --> 13:21.717
Yeah, these things have a way
of working themselves out. Right, boys?

13:21.800 --> 13:25.095
I didn't want to have this conversation
here. Can we please go home?

13:25.179 --> 13:28.140
Oh, no, stay here
where it's inappropriate and awkward.

13:30.267 --> 13:33.771
Good afternoon, folks. Please step in.
May I speak to the homeowners?

13:33.854 --> 13:38.609
My God, will you please tell Mr. Purcelli
I didn't steal his goddamn dog?!

13:38.692 --> 13:41.779
-It's not that this time.
-Oh, God. This fucking guy.

13:42.279 --> 13:45.157
Oh, yeah. You're the lady
who doesn't have a gun. [chuckles]

13:45.241 --> 13:48.452
I know about the gun.
It was a whole thing.

13:48.536 --> 13:51.789
-Catch up, Torres.
-What can we do for you, Officer?

13:51.872 --> 13:54.833
Well, it appears that an orangutan
has escaped from the zoo,

13:54.917 --> 13:59.380
and since you're within a two-mile radius,
we need to cordon off the neighborhood.

13:59.463 --> 14:03.300
Oh, God. Is it Bobo? Chocolate?
Not Lady Beverly?

14:03.384 --> 14:06.679
-It's Ken Allen, Jr.
-Ken Allen's boy?!

14:06.762 --> 14:10.724
-Well, I don't know who his dad is.
-Excuse me. What?

14:10.808 --> 14:13.435
Ken Allen, the hairy Houdini.

14:13.519 --> 14:17.523
He escaped San Diego Zoo
three times in the '70s.

14:17.606 --> 14:19.316
He was a legend!

14:19.400 --> 14:21.694
He high-fived me once.

14:21.777 --> 14:24.697
He was reaching through the bars
to get at your funnel cake,

14:24.780 --> 14:26.699
and you high-fived him.

14:26.782 --> 14:29.368
All I know is is that he
has already attacked one zookeeper.

14:29.451 --> 14:31.745
And male orangutans,
when they feel threatened,

14:31.829 --> 14:34.415
tend to, you know, rip scrotums off. So...

14:34.498 --> 14:35.958
So like us.

14:36.041 --> 14:40.337
If I know Ken Allen Jr., and I do,
this could be a while.

14:40.421 --> 14:42.506
Maybe we should go straight to Bud's now.

14:42.590 --> 14:46.051
I can't let you leave. The neighborhood
is on lockdown until further notice.

14:46.135 --> 14:49.430
What? No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

14:49.513 --> 14:51.557
-We just live next door...
-No exceptions.

14:51.640 --> 14:54.226
Hopefully we'll find Ken Allen Jr.
within the hour.

14:54.310 --> 14:58.647
Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to knock
on more doors before he rips my nuts off.

15:00.024 --> 15:02.067
Who else is rooting for the monkey?

15:06.447 --> 15:10.284
So, do I just like sit there, legs spread,

15:10.367 --> 15:12.244
kind of a like fertility goddess vibe?

15:12.328 --> 15:15.456
Or do I just say "screw it"
and go on all fours?

15:15.539 --> 15:17.374
Either way, we're gonna get an eyeful.

15:17.458 --> 15:19.835
I don't want the pool back, obviously.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.337
That was Mom.

15:21.420 --> 15:22.922
Oh, is she heading back over?

15:23.005 --> 15:24.965
She is not.

15:25.049 --> 15:27.259
-What?
-Dad and Robert's place is under lockdown.

15:27.343 --> 15:29.511
Apparently, an orangutan
escaped from the zoo.

15:29.595 --> 15:31.347
Who are we talking? Bonkers?

15:31.430 --> 15:34.183
Jeffrey Baumgardner? Ape Blanchett?

15:34.266 --> 15:36.101
How does your brain determine
what facts to keep?

15:36.185 --> 15:37.603
I'm sorry, what are we gonna do?

15:37.686 --> 15:41.065
It's fine. Everything'll be okay.
I'm sure she'll be here soon.

15:41.148 --> 15:43.317
-Nothing to worry about until--
-My water...

15:43.400 --> 15:44.985
Breaks. Exactly.

15:45.069 --> 15:46.445
Broke. Just now.

15:46.528 --> 15:48.280
Okay, so...

15:48.906 --> 15:50.532
we have something to worry about.

15:51.283 --> 15:54.078
-What? What?
-Allison's water broke.

15:54.161 --> 15:55.996
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

15:56.080 --> 15:57.665
We're trapped!

15:57.748 --> 15:59.875
Robert, we're gonna need your shovels!

15:59.959 --> 16:01.377
You're gonna tunnel out of here?

16:01.961 --> 16:04.421
Oh, that's an even better idea!

16:05.005 --> 16:07.549
It's gonna be okay.
We'll be at the hospital soon.

16:07.633 --> 16:08.676
Everything's gonna be okay.

16:08.759 --> 16:10.970
What was I thinking,
that I could do this at home?

16:11.053 --> 16:13.847
-Why did you talk me into this?
-Uh... because I didn't.

16:13.931 --> 16:17.893
I know this is not a good time,
but Allison, what moisturizer do you use?

16:17.977 --> 16:20.270
-Your skin is so soft.
-Put me down. Put me down.

16:20.354 --> 16:22.272
I think it's too late. I can't move.

16:22.356 --> 16:24.066
-Stop touching me. Oh, my God!
-Okay.

16:24.149 --> 16:25.150
Oh, God.

16:26.151 --> 16:29.279
I think I'm having a panic attack.
Oh, it's too much.

16:29.363 --> 16:31.365
-My chess coach was right--
-Bud!

16:31.448 --> 16:32.866
Look at me. Get up.

16:32.950 --> 16:34.827
Snap out of it, okay?

16:34.910 --> 16:37.287
This baby is coming,
and we're gonna have to deal with it.

16:37.371 --> 16:39.832
Fortunately for you,
I have some experience at home births,

16:39.915 --> 16:42.876
and was married to a doctor
who delivered babies and was an asshole.

16:42.960 --> 16:44.128
That last part isn't relevant,

16:44.211 --> 16:46.505
but I think I can guide Allison
through this, okay?

16:48.465 --> 16:49.383
You're hurting me.

16:49.466 --> 16:52.344
[groans]

16:53.262 --> 16:56.223
[Bud gasps]

16:57.641 --> 16:59.685
Okay, I'm gonna make a break for it.

16:59.768 --> 17:02.688
Don't be silly.
We just have to wait it out.

17:02.771 --> 17:06.066
Wait this out, are you crazy?
I'm not missing that birth.

17:06.150 --> 17:09.486
Now you either get on my wavelength
or you get out of my way.

17:09.569 --> 17:12.114
Okay! Okay. Okay. Uh...

17:12.364 --> 17:15.159
Here's an idea:
we make a beeline for the car,

17:15.242 --> 17:17.744
and once we make it past
the police barricade, we're home free.

17:17.828 --> 17:20.414
That's the talk momma likes.

17:20.497 --> 17:21.623
Here we go.

17:21.707 --> 17:25.252
Where the hell do you think you're going?
There's a killer monkey out there.

17:25.335 --> 17:27.503
You just don't want to deal
with Oliver and Jo.

17:27.588 --> 17:30.299
No, I do not want to deal
with Oliver and Jo,

17:30.382 --> 17:32.885
nor a dangerously sober Grace!

17:32.968 --> 17:36.889
[Grace] Robert, have I told you
how much I love this rug?

17:36.972 --> 17:38.057
[sighs]

17:38.140 --> 17:41.310
-Why is the hair on my neck standing up?
-[whispers] Phase two.

17:41.393 --> 17:45.981
Sol, I want you to ignore that nonsense
and pay attention to  this  nonsense.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.608
Now, let's go.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.657
They're better off out there.

17:56.325 --> 17:58.535
You know, you didn't exactly
answer my question.

17:58.619 --> 18:00.913
Again, I really rather not have
this conversation here.

18:00.996 --> 18:03.415
Okay, fine. But I think
we need to have it at some point.

18:03.499 --> 18:06.418
Why don't we go home, put on
the original cast recording of  Camelot,

18:06.502 --> 18:08.587
-and talk it out.
-But we can't get home!

18:08.670 --> 18:10.923
-And I already listened to it today.
-[sighs]

18:11.006 --> 18:12.758
Everybody is so tense here.

18:12.841 --> 18:15.969
Come on, Jo, plop yourself down.
Let me give you a shoulder rub.

18:16.053 --> 18:19.389
Actually, how about we do
a shoulder rub train?

18:19.473 --> 18:21.725
Robert? Gay guy?

18:23.769 --> 18:26.939
Unhand me, Stormtrooper!

18:27.022 --> 18:28.690
You promise to stop biting me?

18:29.274 --> 18:30.609
It's involuntary.

18:30.692 --> 18:32.820
We'll behave, Officer.

18:32.903 --> 18:36.907
Oh, she's gonna have that baby
and I'm gonna be stuck here.

18:36.990 --> 18:39.201
I could just die. I really could.

18:39.284 --> 18:41.286
Oh, sweetheart.

18:41.370 --> 18:42.496
Don't be silly.

18:42.579 --> 18:44.957
There's so much to live for:

18:45.749 --> 18:48.627
cake pops, and the beach...

18:49.002 --> 18:50.754
the mysteries of Paris.

18:50.838 --> 18:55.050
You know, even my knee surgery
is a miracle. And cake pops.

18:55.551 --> 18:56.718
Ju-- Hmm?

18:56.802 --> 18:59.096
That's so sweet, Phase Two.

19:00.097 --> 19:03.851
But I don't care. I didn't give up
my life with Jacob in Santa Fe

19:03.934 --> 19:05.644
to miss these moments.

19:05.727 --> 19:08.313
Think how happy you'll be
when you get to hold that baby.

19:08.397 --> 19:11.066
It won't matter
that you weren't there at the birth.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.276
It does matter.

19:12.359 --> 19:15.737
-Why?
-I wasn't there for the birth of our sons.

19:15.821 --> 19:17.698
I didn't know Coyote and Bud
were adopted.

19:17.781 --> 19:19.867
You didn't know Bud was adopted?

19:19.950 --> 19:23.745
I'd have given anything to be there
for their first breath in the world.

19:23.829 --> 19:26.039
And I just thought,
if I could see this one,

19:26.123 --> 19:28.876
it might make up for missing theirs.

19:29.459 --> 19:31.378
Oh, God, Officer...

19:31.461 --> 19:35.007
Officer, are you not moved?

19:36.967 --> 19:38.969
I know you are a good man.

19:39.052 --> 19:40.804
Isn't there anything you can do?

19:40.888 --> 19:43.891
-Ma'am, I'm sorry, but--
-Oh, you could date my daughter.

19:43.974 --> 19:46.560
The nice one with the--
with the cheek bones.

19:46.643 --> 19:48.187
-Mallory?
-Yeah.

19:48.645 --> 19:50.314
Uh, give me five minutes.

19:50.689 --> 19:52.900
Oh, I should have set him up with you.

19:52.983 --> 19:55.485
But there's plenty of good men out there
for both of you.

19:55.569 --> 19:57.613
Excuse me, that's really not funny.

19:57.988 --> 20:01.366
Don't you try to be butch, Stephanie.

20:01.450 --> 20:05.037
-What?
-I know where this story goes!

20:05.120 --> 20:08.457
And this fit young woman isn't gonna
give you the best years of her life

20:08.540 --> 20:13.170
so you can just ditch her for some
marionette with chinchillas for eyebrows!

20:13.253 --> 20:15.422
I'll take that as a compliment.

20:15.505 --> 20:17.090
Don't engage, Sol.

20:17.174 --> 20:18.467
Why are you still here?

20:18.550 --> 20:20.177
You have the use of your legs,

20:20.260 --> 20:22.596
and the monkey doesn't care
about anything but scrotums,

20:22.679 --> 20:24.139
just like your boyfriend.

20:24.223 --> 20:26.767
He's my fiancé
and you're just a mean old bitch.

20:26.850 --> 20:30.270
You all think we're just like you,
but here's the big difference:

20:30.354 --> 20:33.774
no matter who I'm attracted to,
I would never cheat on Jo, okay?

20:33.857 --> 20:36.360
-I love her, and she's my soul mate.
-I'm his soul mate.

20:36.443 --> 20:37.569
Oh! [laughs]

20:37.653 --> 20:42.532
Soul mate! Now there...
there is a meaningless concept.

20:42.616 --> 20:47.746
This one just said to Frankie
she was his soul mate just the other day.

20:47.829 --> 20:50.624
Right, Sol?
Didn't keep him from leaving her.

20:50.958 --> 20:53.377
-Uh... Uh, I...
-What did you say?

20:53.460 --> 20:56.421
You said she was your soul mate
just the other day?

20:56.505 --> 21:00.425
I believe that what I said was Sol-mate,

21:00.509 --> 21:02.844
as in a mate of Sol's.

21:02.928 --> 21:06.556
Not in the romantic or biological sense.

21:06.640 --> 21:09.351
No, more nautical in nature,

21:09.434 --> 21:14.022
as in the assistant
to the master of a merchant ship.

21:14.982 --> 21:15.816
[door slams]

21:15.899 --> 21:19.361
Originally,
from the Middle English, "mette."

21:19.444 --> 21:21.613
We have to get out of here.
These people are crazy.

21:21.697 --> 21:25.117
-We're fast. We live 20 feet away.
-I don't care if we die out there.

21:28.578 --> 21:31.290
-Breathe.
-[groans] Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

21:32.457 --> 21:34.251
[groaning]

21:35.669 --> 21:38.005
Okay, Mallory, administer the epidural.

21:38.672 --> 21:39.756
Oh.

21:39.840 --> 21:42.342
Honey... no.

21:42.426 --> 21:45.095
-[sobs] Oh, please...
-I know.

21:45.178 --> 21:47.306
It was just the day.

21:47.848 --> 21:51.268
The long drive,
the adventure, the Chili's.

21:51.351 --> 21:53.770
I got caught up in the moment.

21:54.229 --> 21:57.190
So you don't think Frankie
is your soul mate?

21:57.774 --> 22:00.360
-What does it matter?
-Oh, Jesus.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.905
What do you want me to do
with this information, Sol?

22:03.989 --> 22:06.491
I mean, what would you do if you were me?

22:07.409 --> 22:08.285
[door opens]

22:08.744 --> 22:10.078
[Torres] I have news.

22:10.162 --> 22:11.246
[door closes]

22:11.705 --> 22:12.706
[Frankie] I'm coming!

22:12.789 --> 22:13.874
[footsteps]

22:13.957 --> 22:15.250
He's got news.

22:15.334 --> 22:16.585
[Frankie] Oh, what happened?

22:18.003 --> 22:19.046
Is it good or bad?

22:19.129 --> 22:21.340
I just got off the phone
with my commanding officer,

22:21.423 --> 22:22.424
and it's good news.

22:22.507 --> 22:24.676
You shot that monkey
and now you're here to shoot me?

22:24.760 --> 22:27.137
No. I lost my gun.

22:27.220 --> 22:29.514
I can get you two out,
but we have to leave now.

22:29.598 --> 22:31.558
Yes! Ha, ha!

22:31.641 --> 22:32.934
[Torres] Uh, there is one catch:

22:33.018 --> 22:36.980
I told him that I had an emergency
with a pregnant woman about to give birth.

22:37.064 --> 22:38.065
Oh!

22:38.732 --> 22:40.025
Let's roll!

22:40.108 --> 22:41.735
[Frankie laughs]

22:41.818 --> 22:42.736
I'm sorry.

22:42.819 --> 22:44.488
It's your grandchild. Go.

22:45.072 --> 22:47.491
I promise we'll talk about this
when I get home.

22:50.160 --> 22:53.663
So, should I get Mallory's number
from you, or just...

22:53.747 --> 22:56.416
look her up on Facebook?
Yeah. I'll do that.

22:57.125 --> 23:00.003
-[door opens, closes]
-I told them not to bring me here.

23:00.087 --> 23:01.546
They should have listened.

23:01.922 --> 23:02.798
[sighs]

23:03.340 --> 23:04.549
I'm sorry.

23:05.300 --> 23:06.301
-What?
-I'm sorry.

23:06.384 --> 23:09.471
I didn't mean to make things worse
between you and Sol.

23:09.554 --> 23:11.515
Grace, is this a new phase?

23:12.432 --> 23:14.893
Yes. Phase four: remorse.

23:15.477 --> 23:17.521
[sighs] Coupled with terror.

23:17.604 --> 23:18.730
Terror?

23:18.814 --> 23:21.983
You know, you will be able
to drink again at some point.

23:22.067 --> 23:26.071
Not if I die on the table. Do you know
how much it would suck to die right now?

23:26.154 --> 23:29.699
It's the one thing
I specifically did not want to do.

23:29.783 --> 23:32.160
-You're not gonna die.
-You don't know that!

23:32.244 --> 23:34.538
Well, remember before my surgery,

23:34.621 --> 23:38.458
when you told me I was not allowed to die
because you weren't done yelling at me?

23:38.542 --> 23:40.627
Well, I'm telling you,
you're not allowed to die

23:40.710 --> 23:42.629
because you're still not done
yelling at me.

23:42.712 --> 23:43.839
Yeah, right.

23:45.006 --> 23:49.094
It's that I just feel
there's so much left to do.

23:49.428 --> 23:50.971
And I really want a drink.

23:51.346 --> 23:54.891
You're gonna have
all the pain pills you want in two days.

23:57.269 --> 24:00.397
That is the nicest thing
you have ever said to me.

24:02.232 --> 24:05.527
I know that you're worried
about this soul mate business,

24:05.610 --> 24:07.487
but, you know, what do you care?

24:07.571 --> 24:09.364
You don't even believe in soul mates.

24:09.447 --> 24:10.824
But Sol does.

24:10.907 --> 24:14.494
And I guess I hoped that he might think...

24:15.662 --> 24:16.538
I don't know,

24:17.497 --> 24:18.748
that I was his.

24:26.465 --> 24:29.634
-[groaning]
-Okay, stop pushing. Breathe. Breathe.

24:29.718 --> 24:31.595
[panting] Oh, she's coming!

24:31.678 --> 24:34.264
But if she's born underwater,
how is she gonna breathe?

24:34.347 --> 24:36.474
She doesn't know
how to hold her breath yet.

24:36.558 --> 24:38.727
I couldn't swim until I was 14.

24:39.311 --> 24:40.437
I don't understand this!

24:40.520 --> 24:42.981
[screams]

24:44.858 --> 24:46.651
Mom! You made it.

24:46.735 --> 24:48.111
Of course I made it!

24:48.737 --> 24:52.324
Nothing could keep Frankie Bergstein
from being here.

24:52.908 --> 24:54.326
Now, get me my towels!

24:54.409 --> 24:55.577
[screams]

24:55.660 --> 24:57.078
Ah. [gasps]

24:57.162 --> 24:57.996
What?

24:58.079 --> 24:59.873
I even made it for the crowning.

24:59.956 --> 25:01.333
[groaning]

25:01.416 --> 25:03.668
Okay, now, I want you just to relax.

25:03.752 --> 25:07.297
I'm gonna try an ancient technique
I learned with the Kalahari Bushmen

25:07.380 --> 25:10.550
when I lived with them for a week
after I got lost from my tour group.

25:10.634 --> 25:11.676
[groans]

25:11.760 --> 25:13.887
[taking deep breaths]

25:14.346 --> 25:18.433
[chanting]
Here, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby...

25:18.516 --> 25:22.520
-Jesus, Mom, that can't be how it works.
-She's coming! She's coming!

25:22.604 --> 25:23.730
I see her shoulders!

25:25.065 --> 25:27.400
When did I get in the baby pool?

25:27.484 --> 25:28.985
[groans]

25:30.737 --> 25:32.197
[Frankie] And here she is!

25:32.280 --> 25:34.366
[baby crying]

25:36.576 --> 25:37.452
[sighs]

25:38.703 --> 25:40.205
[laughing]

25:42.832 --> 25:43.708
[Frankie] Oh!

25:48.046 --> 25:49.881
[baby crying]

25:49.965 --> 25:52.425
-[Frankie laughing]
-She's perfect.

25:52.509 --> 25:54.636
Congratulations, Mommy.

25:57.430 --> 26:00.016
Congratulations, Daddy. [laughs]

26:01.935 --> 26:03.520
Nice work, Grandma.

26:03.603 --> 26:04.854
And you were here.

26:05.563 --> 26:07.607
I was here. [chuckles]

26:08.608 --> 26:10.318
She's beautiful.

26:12.153 --> 26:13.571
[Sol] Um, it's not a big deal,

26:13.655 --> 26:16.825
but you have to name the baby
"Officer Torres."
