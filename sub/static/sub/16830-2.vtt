00:28.555 --> 00:29.742
Hello?

00:29.767 --> 00:32.133
Collect call from an inmate

00:32.235 --> 00:33.850
at the detention facility.

00:33.875 --> 00:35.213
Hey.

01:44.104 --> 01:45.402
Hey, Lisa.

01:45.505 --> 01:47.203
You delivering the paper now, too?

01:47.305 --> 01:49.006
The night before what was supposed to be

01:49.108 --> 01:50.540
your first day as head of CIU,

01:50.643 --> 01:52.649
Hayes Morrison was in
a police holding cell.

01:52.674 --> 01:54.319
Hmm. That's just a rumor.

01:54.344 --> 01:55.723
Until you confirm it.

01:55.748 --> 01:57.714
I run my story, you're back in charge.

01:57.816 --> 02:00.984
Look, even if I confirmed
that rumor, which I'm not,

02:01.086 --> 02:02.318
there's no guarantee of that.

02:02.343 --> 02:04.106
Uh, if Hayes Morrison blows up,

02:04.131 --> 02:06.927
Wallace's priority will be to
keep the CIU running smoothly.

02:06.952 --> 02:08.389
After the Odell Dwyer case,

02:08.414 --> 02:10.358
it's the biggest jewel in his crown.

02:10.577 --> 02:11.815
Hayes was the one
that cracked that case.

02:11.840 --> 02:13.215
And she'll do amazing work

02:13.240 --> 02:15.397
until she gets bored and self-sabotages.

02:15.499 --> 02:16.932
Apparently, that's her pattern.

02:17.541 --> 02:19.568
Just admit it, Lisa.

02:19.671 --> 02:21.602
You're not chasing a story.
You're chasing me.

02:25.375 --> 02:26.708
You're only gonna get me.

02:30.814 --> 02:32.280
You're a good guy, Sam.

02:33.984 --> 02:37.285
You deserve the job
way more than Hayes Morrison.

02:44.917 --> 02:47.795
Sleeping with the help...
how egalitarian of you.

02:47.820 --> 02:49.947
If you don't want me to sleep
with waiters from Mom's campaign events,

02:49.972 --> 02:51.048
don't hire hot ones.

02:51.073 --> 02:53.433
Only ugly waiters...
I'll get right on that.

02:53.458 --> 02:55.184
It's not like I'm running
a Senate campaign.

02:55.209 --> 02:56.895
Or a hotel, for that matter.

02:56.920 --> 02:59.309
You realize that hooking up
with a former First Daughter

02:59.334 --> 03:01.122
is probably a tweetworthy event for him.

03:01.147 --> 03:03.153
As long as he doesn't give me
a bad review, what do I care?

03:03.178 --> 03:04.856
Your promiscuity
is hardly new information,

03:04.881 --> 03:06.779
and you're pretty golden
with the media these days.

03:06.804 --> 03:08.201
Really? How did that happen?

03:08.226 --> 03:09.525
The new job.

03:09.550 --> 03:10.917
You really should thank Wallace.

03:11.019 --> 03:12.872
That's one way of looking at it.

03:14.054 --> 03:15.754
Wallace better fasten his seatbelt.

03:16.278 --> 03:18.044
No idea what you mean.

03:41.058 --> 03:43.414
Who has a conviction to review...

03:43.450 --> 03:45.515
a case worthy of the next
five days of our time?

03:45.540 --> 03:47.842
Virgil Mendez...
life sentence for murder

03:47.867 --> 03:49.430
based solely on a jailhouse informant.

03:49.455 --> 03:53.595
A case prosecuted by our dashing
D.A., Conner Wallace.

03:54.460 --> 03:56.025
Conviction Integrity Units

03:56.050 --> 03:57.617
don't usually investigate cases

03:57.642 --> 03:59.329
from the sitting D.A.'s tenure,

03:59.431 --> 04:01.679
let alone ones that D.A.
personally prosecuted.

04:01.704 --> 04:03.219
Time for us to break out of the mold.

04:03.244 --> 04:04.985
It's our second case.

04:05.010 --> 04:06.877
And Wallace kind of gave you this job.

04:06.902 --> 04:08.930
Correction... he blackmailed me into it.

04:08.955 --> 04:11.506
After you were stopped
with cocaine in your purse.

04:12.679 --> 04:13.845
Let's go.

04:13.870 --> 04:15.403
Career-making cases from Wallace.

04:15.428 --> 04:17.212
The Roosevelt Island Killer.

04:17.314 --> 04:19.570
But he was busted
with a freezer full of feet.

04:19.595 --> 04:21.560
Hammersmith gun-trafficking case.

04:21.584 --> 04:22.726
Pretty open-and-shut, though.

04:22.751 --> 04:24.031
What about the Prospect 3?

04:25.197 --> 04:26.663
My old boss was dying to take it on,

04:26.688 --> 04:28.601
but we didn't have
the time or the money.

04:28.626 --> 04:30.224
So, issues with the conviction?

04:30.671 --> 04:33.045
- A potential miscarriage of justice?
- Definitely.

04:33.070 --> 04:35.958
As well as a huge
careermaking case for Wallace.

04:37.349 --> 04:38.966
We have a winner.

04:44.902 --> 04:46.308
Tell everybody why tonight sucks.

04:46.316 --> 04:47.516
Well, the concert got canceled.

04:47.541 --> 04:48.730
I guess the sound board got...

04:48.755 --> 04:49.799
- Boom!
- Hey, man.

04:49.824 --> 04:52.205
- Oh! Geez!
- Yo, Prospect Park, check it!

04:52.236 --> 04:55.966
Mikey K. and his crew
are gonna bash heads toni...

04:55.991 --> 04:58.259
That's Mike Kurtzman
who stole the camera,

04:58.361 --> 05:00.528
that's Seamus Gadsen,
and Brian McKinney,

05:00.629 --> 05:02.430
collectively known as the Prospect 3.

05:02.532 --> 05:04.765
They're 10 years
into an 18-year sentence

05:04.867 --> 05:07.011
for rape and felony assault
committed that night.

05:07.036 --> 05:09.202
Mike and Seamus were 16.

05:09.304 --> 05:10.603
Brian was 14.

05:10.705 --> 05:12.439
Wallace charged them as adults.

05:12.541 --> 05:14.774
Which makes sense considering
what they did to Zadie Daniels.

05:14.876 --> 05:16.476
This is her before the attack.

05:16.578 --> 05:17.777
And after.

05:20.482 --> 05:22.415
She wasn't expected to survive.

05:22.517 --> 05:24.883
Her brain injury made it
biochemically impossible

05:24.985 --> 05:27.080
for what happened that night
to imprint on her memory.

05:27.105 --> 05:28.185
Kind of a blessing.

05:28.210 --> 05:30.162
Those kids are lucky
they only got 18 years.

05:30.187 --> 05:32.334
We can't go into this
assuming that they're guilty.

05:32.359 --> 05:35.359
Or innocent. We're not the Innocence
Project or law enforcement.

05:35.384 --> 05:37.223
We're after the truth
no matter who it pisses off

05:37.248 --> 05:38.805
or whether it sets anyone free.

05:39.100 --> 05:40.465
A little after 9:30 p.m.,

05:40.567 --> 05:43.528
NYPD officers started
rounding up 35 kids

05:43.553 --> 05:45.169
for setting fires, hassling people,

05:45.271 --> 05:47.338
and other various
acts of mayhem in the park.

05:47.463 --> 05:50.008
Later, Zadie Daniels
was discovered unconscious.

05:50.157 --> 05:53.844
Her broken watch put the time
of the attack at 9:22 p.m.

05:53.946 --> 05:56.235
Of 35 kids, why did the cops
focus on these three?

05:56.260 --> 05:58.452
Brian, Mike, and Seamus were
involved in other incidents,

05:58.477 --> 06:00.843
including the attempted robbery
of another young woman.

06:00.868 --> 06:03.286
And they confessed to assaulting Zadie.

06:03.311 --> 06:06.148
...after hours of questioning,
and later recanted.

06:06.173 --> 06:07.790
But still, they confessed.

06:07.892 --> 06:09.359
I mean, who does that
if they're innocent?

06:09.461 --> 06:10.640
Think of the forensics.

06:10.665 --> 06:12.422
No DNA from the boys on the victim.

06:12.447 --> 06:13.890
Her rape kit tested positive,

06:13.915 --> 06:15.731
but the semen wasn't from
any of the three.

06:15.756 --> 06:18.123
Younger rapists often don't ejaculate.

06:18.148 --> 06:20.503
I mean, a fourth guy may
have gotten away. It...

06:20.908 --> 06:22.577
- Hey, boss.
- Hmm?

06:24.308 --> 06:26.162
First rule of Fight Club, everybody.

06:27.778 --> 06:29.378
You can't just show up here.

06:29.403 --> 06:31.393
Your letterhead says "Office
of the District Attorney,"

06:31.418 --> 06:32.457
so, yes, I can.

06:32.482 --> 06:33.981
We have letterhead?

06:34.083 --> 06:35.314
I'm interested in your next case.

06:35.339 --> 06:36.885
Us, too. Just about to dig in.

06:36.957 --> 06:38.245
I'd like to hear what it is.

06:38.270 --> 06:40.324
You agreed I pick the cases,
no interference.

06:40.349 --> 06:41.833
Not interfering, just asking.

06:43.975 --> 06:45.074
Virgil Mendez.

06:45.099 --> 06:46.708
Serving life for murder

06:46.733 --> 06:48.529
on the word of a prison snitch.

06:48.930 --> 06:51.453
I thought for sure you would've
picked one of my old cases.

06:51.478 --> 06:53.038
You don't know me as well as you think.

06:55.161 --> 06:56.727
Gonna go tattle to daddy?

07:00.878 --> 07:02.830
All three guys
are at Wyckoff Correctional.

07:02.855 --> 07:03.954
I'm gonna go talk to them.

07:03.979 --> 07:04.979
Take Frankie along.

07:05.362 --> 07:07.157
His ex-con insouciance counterbalances

07:07.182 --> 07:08.954
your prosecutorial squareness.

07:09.316 --> 07:10.783
You two, review the confessions.

07:13.102 --> 07:15.438
Conviction Integrity Unit?

07:16.624 --> 07:19.258
You think there's a chance
you could get us out?

07:19.856 --> 07:21.276
Depends if our review finds

07:21.301 --> 07:23.059
significant issues with your conviction.

07:23.897 --> 07:26.298
I never touched the woman.

07:26.400 --> 07:27.599
None of us did.

07:27.701 --> 07:29.601
Then why say you did?

07:30.762 --> 07:32.370
I was 16.

07:32.472 --> 07:34.939
I thought that I was
the king of the world.

07:38.612 --> 07:40.419
I was just a kid.

07:41.116 --> 07:42.276
Tell me about the woman.

07:42.301 --> 07:43.947
I told you I didn't hurt her.

07:44.049 --> 07:45.892
Then why'd this other kid
say that you did?

07:45.917 --> 07:48.716
- Who said that?
- Seamus Gadsen.

07:49.054 --> 07:50.716
The detective is lying.

07:50.749 --> 07:53.153
Which is completely legal
according to the Supreme Court...

07:53.178 --> 07:54.200
Frazier v. Cupp.

07:54.225 --> 07:56.081
I went to law school. I know the ruling.

07:56.106 --> 07:57.441
But these were teenagers.

07:57.466 --> 07:58.920
They were scared out of their minds.

07:58.945 --> 08:00.395
If you or your loved one
had been assaulted,

08:00.420 --> 08:02.272
you'd want the cops to lie,
to intimidate,

08:02.297 --> 08:04.100
to use every trick in the book.

08:04.202 --> 08:06.001
Is that what you wanted, Tess,

08:06.088 --> 08:08.317
when the police were investigating
your aunt's murder?

08:11.945 --> 08:14.210
I'm so sorry. I had no idea.

08:14.235 --> 08:15.977
It was a long time ago.

08:17.126 --> 08:18.423
And it's private.

08:18.448 --> 08:21.562
Not if it potentially impacts
your approach on a case.

08:22.054 --> 08:24.486
Ooh, God. Long night last night.

08:26.089 --> 08:27.835
That was the hospital, Mike.

08:29.025 --> 08:30.824
The woman you beat near to death,

08:30.926 --> 08:32.460
somebody hit her with a brick.

08:32.562 --> 08:34.027
Was it Seamus?

08:34.052 --> 08:35.106
Yeah.

08:35.131 --> 08:36.464
And you were with him?

08:36.489 --> 08:37.520
Yeah.

08:37.546 --> 08:39.543
And you got in the action, too, huh?

08:41.328 --> 08:43.432
You ready for Brian's confession?

08:43.457 --> 08:44.551
Yeah.

08:45.262 --> 08:48.048
Brian, your foster dad
said you should talk to us.

08:48.073 --> 08:49.305
Tell us the truth...

08:49.330 --> 08:51.478
Did you go to the concert alone?

08:51.503 --> 08:52.768
Yeah.

08:52.793 --> 08:56.015
I-I didn't know Seamus
and Mike before that night.

08:56.117 --> 08:59.018
We grew up in the same hood,
but we never met.

09:00.244 --> 09:01.698
Now we're pretty tight.

09:02.745 --> 09:06.198
Yeah, you can make
real connections in here.

09:06.223 --> 09:10.240
It's the only good thing to
co-m-me out of this nightmare.

09:10.968 --> 09:12.848
Were you guys running around
together all night?

09:12.873 --> 09:14.166
Pretty much.

09:14.357 --> 09:15.785
Everybody kind of scattered

09:15.810 --> 09:17.035
when the cops showed at the park,

09:17.137 --> 09:19.505
but we all ended up at the same place.

09:19.607 --> 09:21.374
Looks like you found your path.

09:21.399 --> 09:23.665
In here, every decision is made for you.

09:24.057 --> 09:27.259
Faith is one choice
I could still make, so I did.

09:27.947 --> 09:30.848
Once you got back to the
station, then what happened?

09:30.950 --> 09:32.517
Until my first night in here,

09:32.542 --> 09:35.653
that was the most scared
I've ever been in my life.

09:35.755 --> 09:37.714
They kept saying...

09:37.739 --> 09:39.324
Tell us the truth, Seamus.

09:39.349 --> 09:41.120
I did. I never seen that lady.

09:41.145 --> 09:42.269
We know that's a lie, Seamus.

09:42.294 --> 09:43.628
You attacked her.

09:43.653 --> 09:44.769
We know you did it.

09:44.794 --> 09:46.763
The sooner you admit it,
the sooner it's over.

09:47.109 --> 09:49.510
I was thirsty, hungry, tired.

09:49.535 --> 09:50.900
I just wanted to go home.

09:51.002 --> 09:53.223
They said I could.
All I had to do was...

09:53.248 --> 09:55.264
Tell them what they wanted to hear.

09:57.264 --> 09:58.818
It was a lie.

09:58.843 --> 10:00.909
What I said we did,

10:00.934 --> 10:02.934
I'm never telling that lie again.

10:03.113 --> 10:05.514
Brian, Mike, and I
all promised each other...

10:05.616 --> 10:07.082
no more lies.

10:07.743 --> 10:10.219
No more saying that we hurt that woman.

10:10.244 --> 10:11.983
We saw her coming towards the pavilion.

10:12.008 --> 10:13.588
Who saw her first?

10:13.690 --> 10:15.089
Brian.

10:15.312 --> 10:18.000
There is no way these kids would know
these details if they didn't do it.

10:18.025 --> 10:20.241
The cops hammered them for 10 hours,

10:20.266 --> 10:21.673
fed them information.

10:21.698 --> 10:23.852
Their parents should've lawyered up
or at least pulled them out,

10:23.877 --> 10:25.867
but there is no evidence
of contamination.

10:25.969 --> 10:27.686
You hit her with something
heavy, didn't you?

10:27.711 --> 10:29.436
A brick. Now, where'd you find it?

10:29.739 --> 10:31.147
You're wrong.

10:33.018 --> 10:34.741
About the contamination.

10:34.766 --> 10:36.052
I think the cops

10:36.077 --> 10:38.211
mentioned the brick first
with all the boys.

10:39.268 --> 10:40.728
I'll check.

10:41.584 --> 10:43.977
You were awake this whole time?

10:44.002 --> 10:45.743
Those stories that I slept
through law school...

10:45.768 --> 10:47.831
I just listen better
with my eyes closed.

10:47.856 --> 10:51.536
Okay, maybe 15% of the time,
I was asleep, 20 tops.

10:51.561 --> 10:54.169
The first confession,
call came in from the hospital.

10:54.194 --> 10:56.348
According to the detective notes,
the officer called in

10:56.373 --> 10:57.756
after speaking with the surgeon,

10:57.781 --> 10:59.997
who said the victim's skull
was smashed in

11:00.022 --> 11:02.712
- with, apparently, a brick.
- Got 'em.

11:02.737 --> 11:05.650
Here's Brian's confession at 1:42 a.m.

11:05.675 --> 11:07.238
That's after the hospital called.

11:07.340 --> 11:10.282
Tell me about the brick, Brian.

11:10.307 --> 11:11.810
The brick?

11:12.526 --> 11:14.070
Who hit her with it?

11:14.780 --> 11:16.334
That guy, M-Mike.

11:16.359 --> 11:19.123
And Mike's at 1:38.

11:19.148 --> 11:20.751
And that brick,

11:20.853 --> 11:23.754
you, uh, hit her in the head with it?

11:23.856 --> 11:25.506
No. Seamus did that.

11:25.531 --> 11:27.869
The cops told all three of them
about the brick.

11:27.894 --> 11:29.527
Yes, well, that doesn't prove
their innocence.

11:29.552 --> 11:31.872
Yeah, but these confessions
sure don't mean they're guilty.

11:41.040 --> 11:42.679
_

11:42.704 --> 11:44.423
The boys' confessions
were contaminated, coerced.

11:44.448 --> 11:45.527
Let's forget they existed.

11:45.552 --> 11:47.437
Why didn't the kids'
defense lawyers argue that?

11:47.453 --> 11:49.092
No, the defense did argue coercion.

11:49.117 --> 11:50.264
It just didn't stick.

11:50.289 --> 11:52.033
Wallace played the confessions at trial,

11:52.058 --> 11:54.546
and there is nothing like seeing
the defendants say, "I did it,"

11:54.571 --> 11:56.270
to make juries disregard
everything else,

11:56.295 --> 11:58.239
sometimes even proof of innocence.

11:58.264 --> 12:00.341
- Which doesn't exist here.
- Well, minus the confessions,

12:00.366 --> 12:02.434
there's a really strong case
against the three boys.

12:02.459 --> 12:03.937
I reviewed all the complaint reports

12:03.962 --> 12:05.142
from the park that night.

12:05.167 --> 12:07.037
Mike, Brian, and Seamus
stole that camera,

12:07.062 --> 12:08.322
set fire to the trash can,

12:08.347 --> 12:11.950
and attacked this young woman...
Becky Langes.

12:11.975 --> 12:13.143
She was riding her bike.

12:13.168 --> 12:14.612
The boys grabbed her
and tried to pull her off.

12:14.637 --> 12:16.448
Sounds like a busy night.

12:16.473 --> 12:18.376
Maybe we should see
if it was even possible

12:18.401 --> 12:19.641
for them to have done all that.

12:20.484 --> 12:23.012
A smaller crime is an alibi
for a bigger crime.

12:23.037 --> 12:25.185
Viable and ironic. Check it out.

12:25.210 --> 12:27.748
If Becky Langes was such
a perfect prosecution witness,

12:27.773 --> 12:29.525
then why didn't Wallace
have her testify?

12:29.593 --> 12:32.261
Maybe she was an unreliable witness.

12:32.363 --> 12:33.762
- Your mom.
- Hmm?

12:36.553 --> 12:38.427
Mother, what a surprise.

12:38.452 --> 12:40.458
Note the absence of the word "nice."

12:40.936 --> 12:42.870
Security let me up.

12:42.895 --> 12:45.540
Perk of being a former First Lady.

12:45.718 --> 12:46.984
Harper Morrison.

12:47.009 --> 12:49.077
So good to meet you all.

12:49.179 --> 12:51.160
Maxine Bohen. A pleasure.

12:51.185 --> 12:54.181
Maxine meant to say she didn't
vote for your husband.

12:54.283 --> 12:55.426
What are you doing here?

12:55.451 --> 12:57.016
I wanted to meet your team.

12:57.119 --> 12:58.882
What case are you all tackling now?

12:58.943 --> 13:00.087
The Prospect 3.

13:01.490 --> 13:03.190
Very high profile.

13:03.447 --> 13:04.912
Tess Larson, right?

13:04.937 --> 13:06.103
It's nice to meet you.

13:06.128 --> 13:08.795
- And you must be Sam Spencer.
- Hi.

13:08.897 --> 13:10.230
And you're Franklin Cruz.

13:10.255 --> 13:11.763
- Hey.
- Hi. Hi.

13:12.908 --> 13:14.640
Mom, let's go in my office.

13:15.031 --> 13:16.964
So lovely to have met all of you.

13:18.166 --> 13:19.250
Stop smiling.

13:19.275 --> 13:22.207
She only knows your names
because a staffer briefed her.

13:23.010 --> 13:24.443
I don't care.

13:24.876 --> 13:26.556
Prospect 3.

13:27.148 --> 13:29.758
- That was Wallace's case.
- It deserves a review.

13:29.783 --> 13:31.244
The confessions were contaminated.

13:31.269 --> 13:33.295
Conner Wallace is our friend.

13:33.320 --> 13:34.373
We're Morrisons.

13:34.398 --> 13:36.061
We don't have friends.
We have supporters.

13:36.086 --> 13:37.953
We also have enemies.

13:38.358 --> 13:40.145
Don't turn Wallace into one.

13:40.177 --> 13:41.885
You didn't drop by to give me advice

13:41.910 --> 13:43.440
or see where I work.

13:44.041 --> 13:46.477
CIU is very high-profile.

13:46.650 --> 13:48.198
Jackson insisted that a visit

13:48.223 --> 13:50.063
would be a good campaign photo op.

13:50.148 --> 13:53.049
So he made sure the press
were outside when you came by.

13:53.074 --> 13:55.541
I also wanted to see your office.

13:57.145 --> 14:00.909
This job is an exciting
opportunity, Hayes.

14:00.934 --> 14:02.963
It will be great for your poll numbers.

14:02.988 --> 14:05.056
I meant for you.

14:05.149 --> 14:08.981
You're in charge here,
doing important work.

14:10.138 --> 14:12.514
I'm so proud of you.

14:15.496 --> 14:16.828
Thank you.

14:18.298 --> 14:21.120
I have to go. Victim notification.

14:21.450 --> 14:24.851
Important, difficult work.

14:28.174 --> 14:31.645
Get an orchid... for your desk.

14:31.882 --> 14:33.731
Warm the place up a little.

14:41.378 --> 14:43.110
I can't tell you anything
about that night.

14:43.135 --> 14:44.275
I don't remember it.

14:44.300 --> 14:46.088
Zadie, I'm not here to interrogate you,

14:46.113 --> 14:47.830
just to keep you informed.

14:49.361 --> 14:52.701
Every anniversary of the attack
or an appeal,

14:52.726 --> 14:54.906
it's like I disappear

14:54.931 --> 14:58.333
and go back to being
the Prospect Park survivor.

14:58.380 --> 15:01.248
Everyone calls her brave or heroic.

15:01.867 --> 15:04.955
But she's not you, not all of you.

15:06.710 --> 15:08.565
That was just an event you endured.

15:09.572 --> 15:11.035
Who wants to be defined

15:11.060 --> 15:13.160
by one, terrible night at Prospect Park?

15:17.020 --> 15:18.848
We'll do everything we can

15:18.873 --> 15:21.184
to make sure this investigation
is low-profile.

15:23.059 --> 15:25.746
D.A. Wallace's press conference
isn't gonna help with that.

15:27.629 --> 15:29.062
He called me earlier

15:29.087 --> 15:31.084
and let me know it was happening.

15:33.265 --> 15:35.098
I'm feeling a little typecast.

15:35.123 --> 15:36.525
What do you mean? I'm a black woman.

15:36.550 --> 15:38.071
Zadie Daniels is a black woman.

15:38.096 --> 15:39.516
I got to play her in the re-enactment?

15:39.541 --> 15:41.351
Oh, I'm sorry, I just... I figured...

15:41.376 --> 15:43.376
Frankie, I'm busting your chops.

15:43.478 --> 15:46.044
- I'm Zadie Daniels.
- You're the marauding kids.

15:46.146 --> 15:47.413
Just tell me when to start.

15:47.515 --> 15:49.215
Hold up. We need to be in sync.

15:49.317 --> 15:50.549
Okay.

15:50.651 --> 15:53.018
Her routine was to leave
the office at 9:00 p.m.

15:53.120 --> 15:55.621
Starting the footage now.

15:55.723 --> 15:57.256
And go.

15:57.358 --> 15:59.925
Leaving Zadie's office now.

16:03.530 --> 16:05.129
Well, the concert got canceled.

16:05.232 --> 16:06.264
I guess the sound board got... Oh!

16:06.366 --> 16:08.286
All right, I'm where the kids
grabbed the camera.

16:08.368 --> 16:09.601
Yo, Prospect Park, check it!

16:09.703 --> 16:11.469
Mikey K. and his crew

16:11.571 --> 16:14.205
are gonna bash heads tonight.

16:15.575 --> 16:17.575
I'm on the move.

16:17.677 --> 16:19.610
I'm tracing the kids' steps.

16:29.221 --> 16:31.955
- Get out of here!
- Want to bet?

16:35.660 --> 16:38.461
They raise a little hell,
mess with the crowd.

16:42.333 --> 16:45.067
Turning left through the park gates now.

16:51.376 --> 16:53.642
Arriving at where the kids went pyro.

16:54.411 --> 16:55.777
Yeah!

16:58.415 --> 17:00.148
Whoa!

17:01.652 --> 17:03.985
Mikey K. on the loose!

17:04.087 --> 17:06.655
They shut the camera off after the fire.

17:06.757 --> 17:09.022
What do you know?

17:09.125 --> 17:11.291
And here comes the woman on the bike.

17:11.394 --> 17:12.459
Going past the restrooms.

17:13.862 --> 17:15.796
Passing the park bench.

17:15.897 --> 17:18.432
I'm right when they attacked
the girl on the bike.

17:18.534 --> 17:20.501
- It's, like, late at night...
- Hey! Hey!

17:20.603 --> 17:21.803
Oh, my God.

17:23.439 --> 17:25.172
Turning right up the hill.

17:38.353 --> 17:40.186
Something's wrong.

17:42.857 --> 17:44.289
Frankie?

17:54.435 --> 17:55.435
Frankie.

17:59.670 --> 18:00.933
Frankie!

18:02.222 --> 18:03.597
But the kids still had
eight minutes to get to...

18:03.622 --> 18:04.863
Zadie would have been early.

18:04.888 --> 18:06.591
Coming straight from her office,

18:06.616 --> 18:09.100
she would have to wait to still
be on this spot at 9:22.

18:09.125 --> 18:10.710
Wait, so does that rule out
the three kids?

18:10.735 --> 18:13.551
No, but standing here alone in the dark...
what woman does that?

18:13.653 --> 18:16.053
The 9:22 timeline doesn't make sense.

18:16.155 --> 18:18.355
We're missing something.

18:18.457 --> 18:20.189
Over time, I've come to have doubts

18:20.291 --> 18:21.558
about the boys' confessions.

18:21.660 --> 18:24.394
Now, I set up the CIU as an
independent unit,

18:24.496 --> 18:26.429
but I decided I was allowed
to call in one favor.

18:27.897 --> 18:31.568
So I asked them to review my
prosecution of the Prospect 3.

18:32.665 --> 18:35.191
Are you saying the confessions
were contaminated?

18:35.272 --> 18:36.538
The CIU will make that determination.

18:36.640 --> 18:38.206
And if they are,

18:38.308 --> 18:40.228
and if the conviction
doesn't stand without them,

18:40.310 --> 18:41.710
then those young men will go free.

18:41.812 --> 18:44.079
A corrected mistake, I can live with.

18:44.181 --> 18:46.882
An ongoing injustice... no way.

18:46.984 --> 18:49.451
I'll give you an update
once the review is complete.

18:49.553 --> 18:51.586
Thank you.

18:57.594 --> 18:59.193
Any additional comments?

19:00.630 --> 19:02.112
Checkmate.

19:13.613 --> 19:15.487
_

19:15.512 --> 19:17.660
And if they are, and if the conviction
doesn't stand without them,

19:17.685 --> 19:19.045
then those young men will go free.

19:19.070 --> 19:20.996
So much for keeping Wallace in the dark.

19:21.021 --> 19:23.893
We've been pulling files, asking
questions. Word gets around.

19:23.918 --> 19:25.758
Says the guy who probably
helped it get around.

19:25.822 --> 19:27.055
But what's done is done.

19:27.080 --> 19:28.400
Let's get back
to getting these kids off.

19:28.425 --> 19:30.758
Says the woman who claims
to have no agenda but the truth.

19:31.569 --> 19:34.128
Which, in the case of Becky Langes,

19:34.153 --> 19:35.385
the bike girl,

19:35.410 --> 19:37.761
is that the Prospect 3
used her as a dress rehearsal

19:37.786 --> 19:38.919
for Zadie's attack.

19:38.944 --> 19:40.582
She was a very solid witness.

19:40.607 --> 19:41.730
Her memory of the boys

19:41.755 --> 19:44.759
was detailed, accurate, and scary.

19:44.784 --> 19:46.626
With the confessions,
Wallace didn't need her.

19:46.651 --> 19:49.486
And our park visit didn't
turn up any alibi for the guys.

19:49.511 --> 19:52.279
But it did reveal a possible gap
in Zadie's timeline.

19:52.508 --> 19:53.607
I called her old office

19:53.632 --> 19:55.315
and reviewed the key card records.

19:55.417 --> 19:57.417
Zadie's routine
wasn't routine that night.

19:57.519 --> 20:00.286
She left an hour early at 8:00
instead of 9:00.

20:00.395 --> 20:01.995
What does that mean
for Mike, Seamus, and Brian?

20:02.050 --> 20:03.115
I'm not sure yet.

20:03.140 --> 20:04.756
How come the cops never
pulled those records?

20:04.781 --> 20:05.889
Well, they had the confessions.

20:05.914 --> 20:08.194
They had the time of the attack
thanks to the broken watch.

20:08.219 --> 20:10.662
Wallace missed it, as well.
So did the boys' attorneys.

20:11.078 --> 20:13.078
No one was investigating Zadie.

20:13.377 --> 20:14.867
Since she can't remember where she was

20:14.892 --> 20:16.094
in that missing hour and 20 minutes,

20:16.119 --> 20:17.180
we need to do it for her.

20:17.205 --> 20:20.258
Zadie's supervisor...
a Lewis Anderson...

20:20.283 --> 20:21.975
uh, he swiped out
at the same time that she did.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.674
I'll talk to him, see if he knew
where she was headed.

20:23.699 --> 20:25.041
It probably won't change the fact

20:25.066 --> 20:27.039
she ended up at that park
assaulted by those kids.

20:27.064 --> 20:29.480
Take Sam with you.
Seems like he could use some air.

20:32.352 --> 20:34.118
Just give me a minute.

20:37.178 --> 20:40.701
_

20:57.508 --> 20:58.678
Zadie Daniels?

20:58.703 --> 21:01.772
We used to work together,
but we weren't close or anything.

21:01.797 --> 21:04.414
According to the key card records,
you and Zadie left the office together

21:04.515 --> 21:06.082
- the night she was attacked.
- Mm.

21:06.184 --> 21:10.585
I don't really remember,
but if the records say so...

21:10.687 --> 21:13.875
And we left at the same time,
not together.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.257
So you do remember.

21:15.359 --> 21:17.797
- Uh, yeah...
- I should get back to the office.

21:17.822 --> 21:19.855
Did Zadie mention any after-work plans,

21:19.930 --> 21:21.229
meeting up with a friend or...

21:21.254 --> 21:22.972
I told you we hardly knew each other.

21:22.997 --> 21:25.476
That wasn't the question.
You know what I see here, Lewis?

21:25.501 --> 21:28.622
I see a guy who worked with a woman
who got raped and beaten.

21:28.647 --> 21:30.568
A guy who gets really nervous
when asked about that woman.

21:30.593 --> 21:31.631
I'm not nervous.

21:31.656 --> 21:33.787
A guy who keeps insisting
he wasn't close her,

21:33.811 --> 21:36.259
didn't know where she went,
and definitely wasn't with her.

21:36.968 --> 21:38.134
So, what did you do, Lewis,

21:38.159 --> 21:39.727
follow Zadie into the park that night?

21:39.752 --> 21:41.942
- What?
- Maybe you'd been flirting at work,

21:41.967 --> 21:43.133
decided to close the deal.

21:43.158 --> 21:45.792
You think I raped Zadie,
that I beat her?

21:45.817 --> 21:47.065
Well, I know how we can find out.

21:47.090 --> 21:48.495
Pull his cup from the trash.
We'll run the DNA.

21:48.520 --> 21:50.229
Yeah. Whoa, whoa, whoa,
you can't do that!

21:52.182 --> 21:53.900
It'll match.

21:55.094 --> 21:56.381
The DNA.

21:56.406 --> 21:59.961
But I didn't rape Zadie, I swear.

21:59.986 --> 22:02.719
She and I had been flirting for months.

22:02.744 --> 22:04.090
That night, we snuck out early

22:04.207 --> 22:06.312
to this Cajun bar on Lincoln...

22:06.337 --> 22:07.337
the Second Line.

22:07.362 --> 22:09.534
It was a Mardi Gras theme night.

22:09.559 --> 22:12.160
Beads being tossed around, hurricanes.

22:12.262 --> 22:14.162
We ended up having sex in the bathroom.

22:14.264 --> 22:16.430
It got a little wild.

22:16.532 --> 22:18.808
- Like, how wild?
- Kind of rough.

22:18.833 --> 22:21.047
I smashed my phone screen.

22:21.072 --> 22:22.939
She broke her watch.

22:23.666 --> 22:26.789
That happened with you?
Before the attack?

22:27.343 --> 22:28.888
What time did you leave the bar?

22:28.968 --> 22:30.577
9:30.

22:30.679 --> 22:32.644
I'm a cheating schmuck,

22:32.746 --> 22:35.094
but I'm not a rapist.

22:35.119 --> 22:37.070
When I told Zadie what had happened...

22:37.095 --> 22:38.856
Wait. Zadie knows you two
had sex that night?

22:39.144 --> 22:40.944
When did you tell her?

22:40.969 --> 22:42.588
When she got out of the hospital.

22:49.862 --> 22:51.929
You lied, didn't you?

22:52.031 --> 22:53.364
Lewis Anderson told my colleague

22:53.467 --> 22:54.865
about your Mardi Gras celebration.

22:54.968 --> 22:57.729
We know you had consensual
sex earlier the night of the attack.

22:57.770 --> 22:59.637
You weren't raped, and you knew it.

23:01.441 --> 23:06.676
When I woke up in the hospital,
everyone...

23:06.778 --> 23:09.781
doctors, uh, nurses, the police...

23:09.806 --> 23:11.982
told me I had been raped.

23:12.084 --> 23:14.818
I didn't remember anything
after the office.

23:14.920 --> 23:17.354
As far as I knew, it was the truth.

23:17.456 --> 23:19.856
But Lewis told you before you testified.

23:19.958 --> 23:21.825
You perjured yourself.

23:21.927 --> 23:23.692
You let three men be charged with a rape

23:23.794 --> 23:25.361
you were fairly certain didn't happen.

23:25.463 --> 23:27.063
They nearly killed me.

23:27.098 --> 23:28.564
Rape or not,

23:28.666 --> 23:32.568
those boys destroyed me,
destroyed my life.

23:34.372 --> 23:36.872
Correcting that one detail
meant telling the world

23:36.974 --> 23:40.975
I had sex in a bar bathroom

23:41.077 --> 23:42.965
with a married man.

23:44.948 --> 23:48.350
Everything people
would have said about me then,

23:48.452 --> 23:49.651
they'll say now.

23:51.321 --> 23:54.856
Please, don't do this to me.

23:56.893 --> 23:59.260
Zadie, three men are in prison.

24:04.634 --> 24:06.667
I'm sorry. I...

24:06.769 --> 24:08.835
I don't have a choice.

24:26.954 --> 24:28.621
Zadie Daniels wasn't raped.

24:28.723 --> 24:30.423
What? Of course she was.

24:30.525 --> 24:33.792
She had consensual sex
with a married colleague in bar.

24:33.894 --> 24:36.728
The lab's running DNA to confirm
it was his sperm inside her.

24:36.830 --> 24:37.962
And we've uncovered

24:38.065 --> 24:40.265
a totally new timeline for the case.

24:40.290 --> 24:41.271
How?

24:41.296 --> 24:43.335
Zadie's watch was smashed at the bar.

24:43.437 --> 24:45.070
She was there until 9:30.

24:45.172 --> 24:47.247
The attack didn't take place at 9:22?

24:49.008 --> 24:50.941
I was sure those convictions were solid.

24:52.712 --> 24:53.911
Here, look at this.

24:54.013 --> 24:54.978
The confessions were tainted.

24:55.081 --> 24:56.480
The rape was consensual sex.

24:56.583 --> 24:58.482
The timeline... completely inaccurate.

24:58.585 --> 24:59.950
We have more than enough
exculpatory evidence

25:00.052 --> 25:01.319
to compel a new trial.

25:01.421 --> 25:02.653
Without confessions...

25:02.755 --> 25:05.089
This is why I was so certain.

25:05.191 --> 25:07.324
Brian McKinney's juvie record.

25:07.426 --> 25:08.692
He was a violent kid.

25:08.793 --> 25:11.027
All female victims, no sign of remorse.

25:11.129 --> 25:12.662
Why didn't you use this at trial?

25:12.764 --> 25:14.931
I couldn't. Brian's record was sealed.

25:15.033 --> 25:17.667
Brian wanted to cop a plea
after jury selection,

25:17.769 --> 25:19.369
but we never make deals at trial.

25:19.471 --> 25:20.503
What about the other two?

25:20.606 --> 25:21.846
They express interest in a deal?

25:21.906 --> 25:23.138
No.

25:25.109 --> 25:27.543
We called them the Prospect 3.

25:27.645 --> 25:28.777
We all assumed

25:28.802 --> 25:30.546
the three were together
the entire evening.

25:30.635 --> 25:32.781
When they confessed,
they were all guilty.

25:32.883 --> 25:34.015
When the timeline changed,

25:34.118 --> 25:36.017
it made me think they were all innocent.

25:36.120 --> 25:38.019
But of course,
that isn't the only option.

25:38.122 --> 25:39.931
Brian could be guilty, but the others...

25:39.956 --> 25:41.122
Could be innocent.

25:41.147 --> 25:43.559
The problem is if the judge
vacates the conviction

25:43.613 --> 25:45.870
based on what you uncovered,
then all three of them go free.

25:45.895 --> 25:47.662
Including Brian McKinney.

25:47.764 --> 25:50.732
And without our recommendation,
they all stay in prison.

25:52.101 --> 25:54.001
It's all or nothing.

26:00.655 --> 26:02.444
_

26:08.032 --> 26:09.631
Put everything back up.

26:09.649 --> 26:11.415
There's plenty of exculpatory evidence.

26:11.517 --> 26:12.750
Yes, and if I call the judge,

26:12.775 --> 26:14.272
all the convictions will be vacated,

26:14.297 --> 26:16.853
including Brian McKinney's,
who had a juvie record

26:16.878 --> 26:19.322
for repeatedly getting rough with girls.

26:19.424 --> 26:21.825
He's why Wallace thought
this case was a slam dunk.

26:21.850 --> 26:23.005
He's a violent kid.

26:23.030 --> 26:24.694
New theory to test-drive...

26:24.797 --> 26:26.895
stop looking at the boys
as a single unit.

26:26.989 --> 26:30.495
Instead, consider that Brian
attacked Zadie Daniels alone.

26:30.573 --> 26:32.273
We don't even know if Brian
had time to attack Zadie.

26:32.375 --> 26:35.009
Not to mention any evidence
of his actual guilt.

26:35.034 --> 26:36.576
Or the other guys' actual innocence.

26:36.679 --> 26:39.412
And we have less than 48 hours
to try and get it done.

26:39.514 --> 26:41.675
The longest of those hours
being my time spent

26:41.700 --> 26:44.117
at my mother's campaign event.

26:55.697 --> 26:57.730
I'm calling from
the Conviction Integrity Unit.

26:57.755 --> 26:58.832
Please call me back

26:58.857 --> 27:00.831
regarding a child you fostered
12 years ago...

27:00.856 --> 27:01.888
Brian McKinney.

27:01.913 --> 27:03.212
Thanks.

27:09.231 --> 27:13.188
_

27:32.331 --> 27:35.165
Nothing in the notes about what kids
were picked up where or when.

27:35.190 --> 27:36.258
Well, it makes sense

27:36.283 --> 27:38.592
considering they rounded up
35 kids that night.

27:38.617 --> 27:41.272
I could head back out to Wyckoff,
talk to Mike and Seamus.

27:41.297 --> 27:42.558
If those guys are as tight as you say,

27:42.583 --> 27:43.983
they're just gonna have Brian's back.

27:44.008 --> 27:47.376
Nothing in the forensics
separates Brian from Mike and Seamus

27:47.478 --> 27:50.488
or the other 32 kids herded
into the wagons that night.

27:51.594 --> 27:52.594
Wagons.

27:53.555 --> 27:56.223
They went to the precinct
in patrol wagons, not cars.

27:56.248 --> 27:57.613
Find me the booking sheet.

27:59.429 --> 28:01.123
How could a record
of when the kids were booked

28:01.148 --> 28:02.357
tell us when they were picked up?

28:02.459 --> 28:04.025
FILO.

28:04.522 --> 28:06.061
First in, last out.

28:06.163 --> 28:09.497
The Prospect 3 were all
brought in on the same wagon,

28:09.599 --> 28:11.532
but Brian was processed first,

28:11.635 --> 28:13.501
and then Mike and Seamus
eight kids later.

28:13.817 --> 28:15.750
Those two were the last ones out.

28:15.775 --> 28:18.139
Meaning they were the first ones in.

28:18.241 --> 28:21.768
And the wagon started loading
at... 9:30.

28:21.793 --> 28:23.343
That's when Zadie left the bar.

28:23.368 --> 28:25.989
Mike and Seamus got picked up
before Zadie got to the park.

28:27.416 --> 28:29.083
This essentially proves
they're innocent.

28:29.108 --> 28:30.248
Brian was the first one out,

28:30.273 --> 28:31.295
and the cops must have grabbed him

28:31.320 --> 28:34.497
right before the wagons left
at... 10:10 p.m.

28:34.522 --> 28:36.689
He had plenty of time to attack Zadie.

28:41.663 --> 28:45.398
As Senator,
I hope that I can effect change

28:45.500 --> 28:47.433
the way Hayes is at the CIU.

28:47.535 --> 28:50.235
What they're doing there,
it's remarkable.

28:50.260 --> 28:51.503
You two should meet Nicholas Shore.

28:51.582 --> 28:53.379
- He's got some fascinating notions
- _

28:53.404 --> 28:55.240
- about judicial restraint.
- _

28:55.342 --> 28:57.176
I will join you in a moment.

29:01.548 --> 29:04.063
Put that away, or you and Mom are

29:04.087 --> 29:05.579
- gonna be at each other's throat again.
- _

29:05.604 --> 29:08.186
Actually, we had a nice time
when she came to visit my office.

29:08.211 --> 29:09.363
Mom came to CIU?

29:09.388 --> 29:10.555
- Yeah.
- _

29:10.580 --> 29:12.459
On your directive, Mr. Campaign Manager.

29:12.484 --> 29:13.501
If I had done it,

29:13.526 --> 29:15.366
every media outlet
would have run that photo.

29:24.336 --> 29:26.556
I'd like to follow up on this.

29:26.581 --> 29:27.904
May I call you?

29:28.006 --> 29:29.806
- A minute, mother?
- Oh.

29:29.908 --> 29:33.276
Family first. Excuse me.

29:40.719 --> 29:43.834
At CIU, you wanted to know
what case we were working on.

29:43.859 --> 29:44.822
Mm-hmm.

29:44.847 --> 29:47.456
Jackson didn't arrange
that visit, did he?

29:47.558 --> 29:50.726
Wallace sent you... to spy on me.

29:51.767 --> 29:54.563
Turned out Wallace was right
to be suspicious.

29:54.665 --> 29:56.165
He does know you.

29:56.267 --> 29:58.396
That whole visit was a lie.

29:59.402 --> 30:01.602
You said you were proud of me.

30:01.704 --> 30:03.238
That's true.

30:03.340 --> 30:06.185
Are you ever, ever just my mother?

30:07.244 --> 30:08.809
Or is there always another angle?

30:09.880 --> 30:14.782
Your father and I made
a decision to lead big lives.

30:14.884 --> 30:18.685
Being just your mother
is a luxury I've never had.

30:20.555 --> 30:23.643
You expect me to, what, pity you?

30:24.724 --> 30:25.957
Sympathize?

30:25.982 --> 30:27.754
I was trying to be honest.

30:32.852 --> 30:34.533
Got something?

30:39.407 --> 30:40.976
Brian's first foster family
kicked him out

30:41.001 --> 30:43.107
after he assaulted
their 13year-old daughter.

30:43.132 --> 30:44.598
Doesn't mean he attacked Zadie.

30:44.623 --> 30:46.028
No, it shows pattern of behavior.

30:46.053 --> 30:47.219
The foster father realized

30:47.244 --> 30:48.991
when he found the girl's shirt
under Brian's bed.

30:49.186 --> 30:51.083
Now, because of Zadie's perjury,

30:51.108 --> 30:54.225
Wallace can compel a new trial
and try Brian as a lone assailant.

30:54.250 --> 30:55.982
Meanwhile, Brian is free to beat women

30:56.007 --> 30:58.685
and steal their shirts
and whatever other trophy...

31:05.400 --> 31:07.180
Stop. There. On his wrist.

31:07.205 --> 31:09.314
- They look like Mardi Gras beads.
- They are.

31:09.339 --> 31:11.476
Zadie and her co-worker
were at a Mardi Gras night

31:11.501 --> 31:12.613
before she was attacked.

31:12.638 --> 31:14.396
He said they were handing out beads.

31:14.421 --> 31:15.839
You think Brian took those from Zadie

31:15.864 --> 31:17.542
like he stole his foster sister's shirt?

31:17.609 --> 31:19.576
If he did, we might have
just found our proof.

31:29.358 --> 31:31.155
_

31:37.862 --> 31:39.423
Hi, there. I'm Hayes Morrison.

31:39.448 --> 31:40.884
I-I know who you are.

31:42.776 --> 31:44.776
I've been reading up on you, Brian.

31:44.878 --> 31:46.443
Rough road.

31:46.546 --> 31:48.979
Dad beating on you, foster care.

31:49.708 --> 31:52.615
I bet you got away with a lot
more in the foster system.

31:52.718 --> 31:54.651
Pushed some boundaries.

31:54.753 --> 31:56.586
That's always fun.

31:56.689 --> 31:59.089
Mm. It was all right.

31:59.191 --> 32:00.734
Was it fun, Brian,

32:00.759 --> 32:02.887
when you shoved your foster sister down?

32:05.396 --> 32:07.840
I-I-I don't know
what you're talking about.

32:07.873 --> 32:09.807
Must have been a thrill
ripping off her shirt,

32:09.832 --> 32:11.914
- having a piece of her.
- That wasn't what happened.

32:11.947 --> 32:12.984
That night at the park,

32:13.009 --> 32:14.492
you wanted to hurt
that girl on the bike.

32:14.517 --> 32:16.806
It... It... It... It was just a goof.

32:16.831 --> 32:18.841
Mike and Seamus, sure, but you,

32:18.943 --> 32:21.009
you wanted to hurt her,

32:21.111 --> 32:23.044
wanted to take something from her.

32:23.146 --> 32:25.513
And when she got away, you got so angry.

32:25.987 --> 32:27.625
You broke away from Mike and Seamus.

32:27.650 --> 32:30.679
They got grabbed by the cops,
but you... you found Zadie.

32:30.704 --> 32:32.134
No.

32:35.033 --> 32:36.937
No, that's not true.

32:36.962 --> 32:39.508
Later, when the cops
dumped you in the wagon,

32:40.322 --> 32:42.355
Mike and Seamus, they didn't notice

32:42.380 --> 32:46.149
that you came back
with these from Zadie.

32:47.937 --> 32:49.569
I never seen those before.

32:49.671 --> 32:52.372
You were wearing them on your wrist
the night in the station.

32:52.474 --> 32:54.407
I don't remember.

32:55.096 --> 32:57.071
I got them from your property bag

32:57.096 --> 32:58.221
the night you were booked.

32:58.246 --> 32:59.812
NYPD had them all along.

32:59.837 --> 33:00.837
You want them?

33:00.915 --> 33:02.081
No.

33:02.597 --> 33:03.893
No?

33:06.128 --> 33:07.713
Then I guess I'll just...

33:08.163 --> 33:09.512
Mine!

33:13.315 --> 33:14.581
Mine.

33:23.246 --> 33:24.778
They're not yours.

33:24.803 --> 33:25.868
What?

33:27.956 --> 33:29.321
The ones from your property bag

33:29.346 --> 33:31.328
are being tested for Zadie Daniels' DNA.

33:40.253 --> 33:41.941
Look. It's your friends.

33:44.323 --> 33:45.721
Or was that a lie, too?

33:45.746 --> 33:47.299
No, they're... they're my boys.

33:47.324 --> 33:49.042
Then do right by them.

33:49.411 --> 33:50.870
Tell the truth.

33:59.181 --> 34:00.680
Brian confessed,

34:00.705 --> 34:02.605
and the DNA on the beads backs it up.

34:02.707 --> 34:04.739
He assaulted Zadie Daniels by himself.

34:04.842 --> 34:07.609
He'll serve his sentence
for robbery and assault.

34:07.634 --> 34:09.985
Mike and Seamus' rape convictions
are being overturned.

34:10.011 --> 34:13.047
They've already served time
for their other crimes.

34:13.150 --> 34:14.716
Did he hurt you?

34:14.819 --> 34:16.118
I'm fine.

34:19.023 --> 34:20.621
Let me see.

34:28.197 --> 34:29.931
You did what I couldn't.

34:30.626 --> 34:32.759
Found the truth
of what happened that night.

34:35.687 --> 34:37.467
I'd like to...

34:38.645 --> 34:40.511
find a way to say thank you.

34:44.679 --> 34:46.779
Next time you want to check up on me,

34:47.440 --> 34:49.393
find a different spy

34:50.052 --> 34:51.654
because I'm never sleeping with someone

34:51.679 --> 34:53.485
already in bed with my mother.

36:23.639 --> 36:26.679
I'm sorry about your aunt.

36:27.366 --> 36:29.491
And everything after.

36:32.728 --> 36:34.091
I looked into the case.

36:34.116 --> 36:36.349
- Sorry.
- Bad habit from being a cop.

36:39.154 --> 36:41.752
Witnesses make mistakes. It happens.

36:43.658 --> 36:44.962
The guy you put away...

36:47.028 --> 36:48.344
...he works in the city.

36:48.369 --> 36:49.970
He has a coffee cart.

36:51.384 --> 36:53.164
Seems like he's doing okay.

36:57.004 --> 36:59.110
You need to mind your own business.

37:12.051 --> 37:13.150
Your appeal?

37:14.887 --> 37:16.120
They turned me down.

37:38.943 --> 37:40.176
Hayes. Hayes.

37:42.447 --> 37:45.780
Zadie Daniels was the victim
of a terrible crime.

37:45.883 --> 37:47.283
Everything she did in the aftermath

37:47.385 --> 37:50.453
came from a desire to keep
her private life private.

37:51.080 --> 37:53.429
The scrutiny she is under now
only proves

37:53.539 --> 37:55.717
that she was right to worry
about being judged.

37:55.742 --> 37:57.926
- Zadie!
- Tell us, why did you lie?!

38:01.131 --> 38:02.131
Zadie, why'd you lie?

38:02.232 --> 38:03.450
Zadie, why'd you lie?

38:03.475 --> 38:05.589
How many married men
did you sleep with, Zadie?

38:05.614 --> 38:07.489
How many? One, two, three?

38:07.514 --> 38:09.179
How many married men was it, Zadie?

38:21.050 --> 38:22.890
I wouldn't have picked
the Prospect 3 case

38:22.951 --> 38:24.407
because Wallace prosecuted it.

38:24.432 --> 38:26.282
He's the sitting D.A.
He set up the unit.

38:26.307 --> 38:27.464
Hayes didn't care,

38:27.489 --> 38:29.502
and two innocent men got out of jail.

38:29.527 --> 38:31.145
You're not confirming
the rumor, are you?

38:31.170 --> 38:32.269
No.

38:32.294 --> 38:33.517
I'm not.

38:33.542 --> 38:35.727
Hayes Morrison doesn't deserve
to run the CIU.

38:35.791 --> 38:37.257
Wallace doesn't agree with you.

38:39.544 --> 38:41.144
I might not, either.

38:48.543 --> 38:50.651
You are a really good guy, Sam.

38:50.676 --> 38:52.104
That's it? We're done?

38:52.129 --> 38:53.878
And I'm a really good reporter.

38:54.247 --> 38:55.880
Eventually, I'll break this story.

38:55.905 --> 38:58.383
I just hope I don't smash CIU
or you in the process.

39:10.477 --> 39:12.837
Following the release
of two members of the Prospect 3,

39:12.862 --> 39:14.509
questions continue about Zadie Daniels.

39:14.534 --> 39:16.454
Was her amnesia faked?

39:24.278 --> 39:25.843
Wrapped up another one.

39:25.868 --> 39:27.420
Good job.

39:27.709 --> 39:29.212
Great job.

39:29.314 --> 39:33.082
We had five days to solve
a 10-year-old case.

39:33.184 --> 39:35.306
We made sure justice was just,

39:35.331 --> 39:37.420
and we kept a dangerous man in jail.

39:38.462 --> 39:41.791
Some things along the way...

39:42.375 --> 39:44.735
the situation with Zadie, I...

39:46.454 --> 39:48.029
We found the truth.

39:48.178 --> 39:49.477
We did our job.

39:53.604 --> 39:55.103
I can't do this.

39:55.205 --> 39:58.477
You gave two boys
their lives back, Hayes.

40:00.010 --> 40:01.275
You did that.

40:01.641 --> 40:03.312
And you're gonna do it again.

40:04.820 --> 40:06.718
But first...

40:09.632 --> 40:11.285
...we dance.

40:11.387 --> 40:13.852
I-I don't feel like it.

40:13.877 --> 40:15.989
Since when do you turn down a party?
