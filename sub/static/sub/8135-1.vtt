01:59.122 --> 02:00.878
Coming out, folks.

02:00.945 --> 02:03.433
Place your bets.
Place your bets.

02:04.914 --> 02:07.980
I can't lose tonight!

02:08.050 --> 02:11.879
Don't say that. It brings bad
luck. I do not believe in luck.

02:16.146 --> 02:18.448
Okay, Lonnie, he's winning
big. It's now or never.

02:26.643 --> 02:29.294
I think it's goin' down. Wilson
just sent Lonnie to the elevator.

02:29.363 --> 02:32.330
Loud and clear, Lieutenant.
If she's comin', I have a front-row seat.

02:40.948 --> 02:45.356
I've got her.
She just went into Acton's suite.

02:48.052 --> 02:50.124
Muntzy, be careful.

02:50.196 --> 02:52.652
Hey, hey. I got 10 years on you, buddy.

02:52.724 --> 02:54.896
I'm the original man of steel.

02:54.964 --> 02:57.452
You're the one I'm worried about.
You're in that bed of snakes.

03:20.310 --> 03:23.158
Wilson, I'm finished.

03:23.222 --> 03:25.131
Well, be sure nobody sees you.

03:25.206 --> 03:27.443
There's no one in the hallway
but an electrician.

03:27.510 --> 03:30.412
Electrician? You didn't say anything
about an electrician.

03:30.486 --> 03:32.396
He works for the hotel.
I've seen him around.

03:32.470 --> 03:35.700
- Stay in the room.
- Croupier, for you.

03:35.767 --> 03:37.676
Wilson.

03:40.599 --> 03:42.803
We are calling it a night.

03:42.871 --> 03:45.140
Come on, sweetheart. Let's go.

03:45.207 --> 03:47.793
Make sure security is behind us
until we get these in the room safe.

03:47.864 --> 03:49.293
- All right?
- All right.

03:51.832 --> 03:53.741
Delay him.

03:56.151 --> 04:00.210
I want you to stay close to Mr. Acton.
He's carrying a great deal of cash. Right.

04:01.753 --> 04:04.338
Lonnie, get out of the room fast.

04:04.408 --> 04:07.125
Acton's on his way up.
What about the guy on the ladder?

04:07.192 --> 04:10.902
If he follows you, I'll handle him. You
get in your car and head east out of town.

04:10.968 --> 04:12.856
We'll pick up the film from you there.

04:19.129 --> 04:21.039
She's leaving in a hurry, Lieutenant.

04:21.113 --> 04:24.561
I know. Wilson just put me in charge. We've
got a broken play. Can you follow Lonnie?

04:24.634 --> 04:26.521
Back me up if I blow it.

04:26.585 --> 04:29.171
We've got six months in this one,
Muntzy. I'll be right behind you.

04:29.242 --> 04:32.820
Charles, security can only do so much in
a crowd with you carrying all these chips.

04:32.890 --> 04:36.086
I'd feel a lot better if we took it
to the cashier. No, I don't wanna...

04:36.154 --> 04:39.286
- That's good advice, Mr. Acton. I'd recommend it.
- You're probably right.

04:39.354 --> 04:41.459
They're clumsy as hell anyway.

04:53.435 --> 04:56.851
You can relax, Lieutenant. Be careful,
Muntzy. I don't know where Wilson is.

04:56.924 --> 04:59.641
Gray, they've burned her.
She's got a guy on her tail.

04:59.708 --> 05:02.261
He's in a maintenance suit.
Now stop him.

05:06.235 --> 05:07.894
I got her.

05:14.013 --> 05:16.501
And I got him.

05:20.573 --> 05:22.907
Excuse me. Wait here, Mr.
Acton. And don't leave.

05:22.973 --> 05:25.013
What are you talking about?
Where are you going?

05:25.084 --> 05:26.939
Michael.
I think he made you. Muntzy.

05:27.005 --> 05:28.914
Muntzy.
Wait a minute.

05:33.181 --> 05:35.286
Michael, what are you doing?

05:54.271 --> 05:56.692
Muntzy!

06:00.319 --> 06:02.774
Watch him. I'll get help. No,
look, Lieutenant. Forget it.

06:02.847 --> 06:04.920
Uh... Uh- uh.
Muntzy.

06:04.991 --> 06:07.413
- Go after her.
- Muntzy, you gotta hang on.

06:07.487 --> 06:09.462
Muntzy!

06:10.592 --> 06:12.380
Stay here with him.

06:12.447 --> 06:14.586
No, I'll go with you.

06:26.176 --> 06:28.118
Get an ambulance.

06:28.193 --> 06:30.527
Call for a doctor someone!

06:30.593 --> 06:33.822
Michael, why are you doing this?
You were hired to protect Charles.

06:33.889 --> 06:36.889
You can't leave him. These people
are no longer interested in your boss.

06:36.961 --> 06:39.612
They just got what they were
after. What are you talking about?

06:39.681 --> 06:42.015
I don't have time
to explain it all to you now, Tanya,

06:42.082 --> 06:46.817
but your boss's chief of security is up to his
Bahamian bank accounts in industrial espionage.

06:46.882 --> 06:49.086
And now murder.
I don't believe it.

06:49.154 --> 06:51.609
Did you believe that dead cop
back there? He was my partner.

06:51.682 --> 06:53.657
I was supposed to be
covering him.

07:10.851 --> 07:14.200
Will you step out
of the car please, Lonnie?

07:15.236 --> 07:17.537
You did a really nice job.

07:17.604 --> 07:19.426
I'll take that microfilm.

07:24.739 --> 07:26.594
All right. Hold it right there.

07:26.659 --> 07:28.699
You move, I fire.

07:28.772 --> 07:31.642
Drop the gun, Symes,
and kick it over here.

07:32.772 --> 07:34.659
Looks like we made a small mistake.

07:34.724 --> 07:37.146
I'd call treason
more than a small mistake.

07:37.220 --> 07:39.162
It draws the death penalty.

07:39.237 --> 07:42.019
Tanya, pick up his gun.
That won't be necessary.

07:43.781 --> 07:45.723
I have my own.
Drop it.

07:52.741 --> 07:56.222
- You're workin' for them?
- Oh, I've disappointed you.

07:56.294 --> 08:00.450
Tanya, give me the gun. I can still
make a deal for you if you cooperate.

08:01.414 --> 08:04.763
- Give it to me.
- I intend to.

08:36.008 --> 08:39.139
My God, we're too late.

09:27.018 --> 09:29.157
Well,

09:29.227 --> 09:31.082
what's the word?

09:32.043 --> 09:35.971
I'm gonna give you the same answer that
I've been giving you for the past four days.

09:36.043 --> 09:39.491
He's probably the only human being
on this planet...

09:40.459 --> 09:42.314
who's in worse condition than you are.

09:43.980 --> 09:45.889
Is he going to die?

09:45.964 --> 09:50.853
He should have. That bullet was fired
point-blank right into his skull.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.779
Well, how did he survive?

09:52.844 --> 09:56.521
The man has a metal plate
in his forehead.

09:56.588 --> 10:00.517
You see? Probably military
surgery, I would guess.

10:00.589 --> 10:04.451
It deflected the bullet, which
was heading right toward his brain,

10:04.525 --> 10:08.103
and it came back out...
Through his face.

10:09.069 --> 10:11.076
We'll never know what he looked like.

10:25.230 --> 10:26.637
Muntzy!

10:32.591 --> 10:34.925
That's all right, son.

10:34.990 --> 10:38.853
Keep hurting.
It'll keep you living... just like me.

10:58.640 --> 11:01.422
I've got good news for you.
The Knight 2000 will be ready...

11:01.488 --> 11:03.398
Shh, shh, shh.

11:44.147 --> 11:47.530
- That bad?
- On the contrary.

11:47.602 --> 11:49.512
It's an excellent job.

11:51.411 --> 11:54.706
Here. Why don't you take a look?

12:01.428 --> 12:03.337
It isn't me.

12:03.411 --> 12:06.226
It gives you
a second chance to live.

12:06.291 --> 12:10.547
Unless, of course, you'd prefer to walk around with
a face that might get you killed all over again?

12:10.612 --> 12:13.908
You take my word.
You'll be much safer with this face.

12:13.972 --> 12:16.427
And it's, um,

12:16.500 --> 12:18.224
rather handsome,

12:18.293 --> 12:20.202
if I do say so myself.

12:30.005 --> 12:32.493
Does it strike you
that there's an uncanny resemblance...

12:32.565 --> 12:35.664
between this young fellow
and you as a young man?

12:40.214 --> 12:42.123
My imagination, I suppose.

12:42.198 --> 12:44.108
Stick to your task.

12:44.181 --> 12:46.996
- When will I see it?
- I've been trying to tell you.

12:47.062 --> 12:50.510
- It could be ready within the month.
- Excellent.

12:52.022 --> 12:55.732
I pray that it leaves me enough time.

13:02.679 --> 13:07.152
- What have you told him?
- I've told him he no longer has anyone to fear.

13:07.223 --> 13:10.125
In the eyes of the law,
Michael Long is legally dead,

13:10.200 --> 13:12.142
and we haven't done
anything wrong.

13:12.216 --> 13:15.696
Wilton, stealing a body
from the medical school...

13:15.767 --> 13:17.873
so that the police can find it...

13:17.944 --> 13:20.627
is hardly what I would call
playing by the rules.

13:20.696 --> 13:22.606
I make my own rules.

13:22.680 --> 13:25.528
So does the government. They fake
deaths and identities all the time.

13:25.592 --> 13:27.283
Not to mention our adversary.

13:27.352 --> 13:29.392
All right.
But why are you doing it?

13:30.584 --> 13:32.527
I think you know why, Devon.

13:32.600 --> 13:35.350
I want to leave something behind me...
Something worthwhile.

13:35.417 --> 13:38.036
Not just a lot of numbers
in a bank account.

13:39.129 --> 13:41.780
Now, when will the Knight 2000 be ready?

13:41.849 --> 13:44.533
Soon. I have the crews working
double shifts.

13:44.602 --> 13:48.726
Make it around the clock. I want it done.
I want it done within the next 48 hours.

13:48.794 --> 13:50.649
Forty-eight hours?

13:50.714 --> 13:52.853
Wilton, has the doctor said...

13:52.922 --> 13:56.021
Don't you worry about
what the good doctor has told me.

13:56.090 --> 13:58.326
I'll worry about the doctors...

13:59.610 --> 14:01.945
and Michael Long.

14:06.458 --> 14:09.590
Aren't you pushing it
a bit, Michael?

14:09.659 --> 14:12.441
I gotta get back in shape real fast.

14:12.506 --> 14:14.514
I got one last debt to pay.

14:14.587 --> 14:17.107
Is revenge the only thing you can think of?

14:17.179 --> 14:19.481
You're better than that.

14:19.547 --> 14:22.100
You were a good cop.

14:22.171 --> 14:24.081
Was I?

14:25.308 --> 14:27.195
As I recall, I blew it.

14:27.260 --> 14:29.977
What if I were to offer you another shot?

14:30.044 --> 14:32.978
I want Tanya and her friends too,

14:33.052 --> 14:34.962
but that's only the tip of the iceberg.

14:35.037 --> 14:38.931
- Now, if we were to work together...
- Mr. Knight, my last partner is dead.

14:40.060 --> 14:42.199
Nothing personal,
but from now on I work alone.

14:42.268 --> 14:45.302
I can't take responsibility
for anybody's life but my own.

14:46.333 --> 14:48.242
I think you can understand that.

15:54.305 --> 15:56.639
Enough, Devon.

15:56.705 --> 15:59.803
You've had your fun with our guest.

16:05.249 --> 16:07.518
It isn't polite
to sneak around uninvited.

16:09.506 --> 16:11.961
Be gracious, Devon.

16:12.034 --> 16:14.969
I think an explanation
is well overdue.

16:15.041 --> 16:18.620
Damn right it is.
What is all this?

16:18.690 --> 16:22.520
What are you guys up to... People sneaking in
and out of here at all hours of the day and night?

16:22.594 --> 16:25.856
Look at who's talking.
Oh, be quiet, both of you.

16:25.922 --> 16:28.094
And let's get down to business.

16:29.571 --> 16:31.513
I'm running out of time,

16:31.587 --> 16:33.823
and Michael here is...

16:33.891 --> 16:36.608
now healthy enough to carry on.

16:36.675 --> 16:38.747
Carry on what?

16:38.819 --> 16:42.649
I don't know what you people do out here,
but I just want to get on with my life.

16:42.724 --> 16:44.284
That's not very grateful.

16:44.355 --> 16:47.421
Aren't you the least bit angry
at the people who left you to die?

16:47.491 --> 16:49.346
Angry?

16:49.412 --> 16:51.266
Angry doesn't even come close.

16:51.332 --> 16:54.015
But I'm gonna adjust.
You know why? Tell me.

16:54.084 --> 16:56.256
Because they're too big.

16:56.324 --> 16:59.488
The kind of criminals that operate
above the law. Nobody can touch 'em.

16:59.556 --> 17:01.531
I don't agree with you.

17:02.725 --> 17:04.634
Well, you're entitled to your opinion.

17:04.709 --> 17:07.840
As for me, I'm pulling out
of here tonight, and I, uh...

17:07.909 --> 17:09.567
I'm taking my car with me.

17:12.390 --> 17:14.332
Prepare the car for him, Devon.

17:14.406 --> 17:18.814
A great deal he'll have to know about it
before it's safe for him to drive.

17:20.518 --> 17:22.144
I must go to bed.

17:22.214 --> 17:25.727
I'm not, uh...

17:25.798 --> 17:27.707
Feeling very well.

17:30.566 --> 17:33.054
You've just struck a dying man.

17:33.126 --> 17:35.777
Hey, listen.
I like that old man.

17:35.846 --> 17:39.195
I really do. But, Devon, I
gotta get on with my own life.

17:39.271 --> 17:41.508
You wouldn't have a life
if we hadn't brought you here.

17:41.575 --> 17:45.088
Remember, there are still people who will
kill you if they find out you're alive.

17:45.159 --> 17:47.330
But I'm legally dead, remember?

17:47.399 --> 17:49.374
Devon, I don't even know me
with this face.

17:49.447 --> 17:51.335
Now what's all this about my car?

17:51.399 --> 17:55.971
Any resemblance between that car
and your own is purely superficial.

17:56.040 --> 18:00.034
What are you talking about? Devon, that's
my car. I left it out in the desert.

18:00.104 --> 18:02.559
No, it may look like your car,

18:02.632 --> 18:07.007
but in actuality, this vehicle is probably
the most expensive car in the world.

18:07.080 --> 18:09.731
Come on. This is my car.

18:09.800 --> 18:12.321
What's this? A new paint job?

18:12.393 --> 18:15.011
It feels like baby skin.

18:15.081 --> 18:18.180
Boy, those guys did a nice job.
There's not a ripple on it.

18:18.249 --> 18:20.453
Like a mirror.

18:20.521 --> 18:22.408
It's not paint.

18:22.474 --> 18:26.271
It's a finish bonded into the
molecular structure of a new substance.

18:26.345 --> 18:28.233
You mean the metal?

18:28.297 --> 18:31.167
It's not metal, and it's not fiberglass.

18:31.242 --> 18:33.216
Excuse me.

18:37.962 --> 18:41.377
Here. Strike the surface
as hard as you can.

18:41.450 --> 18:44.582
Come on, Devon. I'm not gonna
hit my car. It's beautiful. Hmm.

18:47.658 --> 18:49.546
There's not a mark on it.

18:49.610 --> 18:51.520
How did you do that?

18:51.595 --> 18:53.700
Don't just stand there
with your mouth open.

18:53.771 --> 18:56.226
Get in the car.
I'll show you.

19:06.539 --> 19:08.547
Welcome aboard the Knight 2000.

19:08.620 --> 19:11.075
Thank you.
What's all this?

19:11.148 --> 19:13.384
Looks like Darth Vader's bathroom.

19:13.452 --> 19:15.973
It is a one-of-a-kind car, Mr. Long.

19:16.044 --> 19:19.110
It is the fastest, safest,
strongest car in the world.

19:19.180 --> 19:21.482
It is also completely fuel-efficient...

19:21.548 --> 19:24.712
and is operated entirely
by microprocessors...

19:24.780 --> 19:28.971
which make it virtually impossible for it to
be involved in any kind of mishap or collision.

19:29.037 --> 19:33.063
Unless, of course,
specifically so ordered by its pilot.

19:33.133 --> 19:35.021
Pilot?

19:35.085 --> 19:37.671
Don't tell me this thing flies.

19:37.742 --> 19:40.295
No. But it thinks.

19:41.261 --> 19:43.301
It thinks?

19:43.373 --> 19:46.090
My car thinks?

19:46.158 --> 19:48.525
We like to think of it as our car.

19:49.486 --> 19:51.690
Now, in order to
motivate it forward...

19:51.759 --> 19:56.429
I recognize the more rudimentary
controls, such as the accelerator, Devon.

19:57.390 --> 19:59.333
I do know how to drive.

20:05.967 --> 20:10.222
I would have preferred you
to have let me open the door first.

20:10.287 --> 20:12.841
However, as you see,
no harm has come to the car.

20:12.912 --> 20:15.116
You also told me this machine
couldn't have a collision.

20:15.184 --> 20:16.907
Not if the system is operable.

20:16.975 --> 20:19.943
And to do that, you have to, uh,
switch it on first.

20:21.808 --> 20:25.321
- Like that.
- Now you're telling me...

20:25.392 --> 20:28.175
I can't hit anything?

20:28.241 --> 20:29.834
Trust me.

20:29.905 --> 20:32.622
I'll never trust anybody again.

20:45.169 --> 20:47.438
I'm warning you, Devon.

20:47.505 --> 20:49.393
I'm gonna put this thing
to the test.

20:49.458 --> 20:51.367
Be my guest.

21:02.002 --> 21:04.238
I don't believe this.

21:04.307 --> 21:06.674
I'm playing chicken
with a 10-ton semi.

21:14.739 --> 21:17.935
Devon, the car just drove around
the truck. It steered itself!

21:18.003 --> 21:20.175
Yes. It's marvelous, isn't it?
I hate it!

21:20.243 --> 21:22.152
I like to make my own decisions.

21:22.227 --> 21:26.090
Well, the microprocessor deduced that you
were acting contrary to your best interests.

21:26.163 --> 21:29.579
It had two choices.
Either to slow down...

21:29.652 --> 21:31.659
or to maneuver around the obstacle.

21:31.732 --> 21:35.376
Why didn't this thing slow down instead of
driving around? It would have been a lot safer.

21:35.445 --> 21:39.820
- Well, um...
- Well, why? Did I find a flaw in your perfect machine here?

21:39.892 --> 21:41.899
No, no. No flaw. I assure you.

21:41.972 --> 21:43.827
It's just that, um...
It's just what?

21:43.892 --> 21:46.795
Well, it was showing off for you.

21:46.868 --> 21:49.257
What?

21:54.390 --> 21:57.205
Come on. You're telling me
that this car can just take off...

21:57.270 --> 21:59.953
and go for gas or a car wash
just like that, huh?

22:00.021 --> 22:01.265
Mm-hmm.

22:01.333 --> 22:04.498
Well, that would be terrific
if I happened to be working under it.

22:04.566 --> 22:06.573
It wouldn't harm you.
I assure you.

22:06.646 --> 22:10.258
Its primary function is the
preservation of human life... Your life.

22:10.326 --> 22:12.879
By me you mean...
Anybody driving this thing.

22:12.950 --> 22:15.023
No, no, no. I mean you specifically.

22:15.095 --> 22:16.949
You, Michael Arthur Long.

22:22.134 --> 22:24.044
You'd better hurry.

22:31.447 --> 22:34.033
We're too late.

22:41.304 --> 22:43.213
Almost.

22:45.176 --> 22:47.958
What kept you?
Car not fast enough?

22:48.024 --> 22:50.577
Look, you gotta
put that thing on the market.

22:50.648 --> 22:52.339
It could save
thousands of lives.

22:52.408 --> 22:56.500
Have it taken away from me and kept off
the market like they did my air... airplane?

22:56.569 --> 22:59.951
Don't try to talk.
I'll explain everything.

23:01.017 --> 23:03.156
Mr. Knight is the last of his breed.

23:03.225 --> 23:06.040
He built his own empire
just as the Fords and the Rockefellers did.

23:06.105 --> 23:07.960
Devon, we've been all through this.

23:08.025 --> 23:11.670
All right.
Michael, come closer.

23:16.505 --> 23:20.117
You were spared to lead a great fight.

23:21.562 --> 23:24.148
Don't turn away in fear.

23:24.218 --> 23:27.415
One man can...

23:27.482 --> 23:29.392
make a difference.

23:31.258 --> 23:34.870
And you are going to be that man.

23:39.131 --> 23:41.041
Mr. Knight, uh,

23:42.460 --> 23:45.329
I'd like to be able to promise you...

23:45.404 --> 23:49.179
that I feel like I could take on
the world someday, but I can't.

23:49.244 --> 23:51.830
I still wake up in the middle
of the night shaking.

23:54.332 --> 23:58.075
That... That gun in my face
and the whole world blowing up.

23:59.772 --> 24:02.325
Remember that moment.

24:02.396 --> 24:07.033
Think of it as your... baptism by fire.

24:17.149 --> 24:21.906
My... adventure has ended.

24:23.582 --> 24:26.877
Yours has just...

24:29.182 --> 24:31.091
just begun.

24:54.912 --> 24:57.083
For God's sake,
don't go quite so fast.

24:57.152 --> 25:00.186
I'm puffed. Sorry, Devon,
but I got places to go.

25:00.256 --> 25:02.263
What the hell does that mean?

25:02.336 --> 25:05.751
Heard you on the phone this morning.
You found the girl in California.

25:05.824 --> 25:09.021
What? You mean to say that you deliberately
listened in on a private conversation?

25:09.088 --> 25:11.095
Listen, I don't do things like that,

25:11.168 --> 25:13.503
but you got so excited, you
were talking a mile a minute.

25:13.569 --> 25:15.674
The gardener could have
heard you over the lawn mower.

25:15.745 --> 25:17.600
Now, what's she up to?

25:19.233 --> 25:21.600
She's working
in a place called Silicon Valley.

25:21.665 --> 25:24.894
All right. If Tanya's in Silicon Valley,
that's where I'm going right now.

25:24.961 --> 25:28.027
- I forbid it.
- Devon, you can't forbid it.

25:28.097 --> 25:29.985
I can certainly take away the car.

25:30.050 --> 25:32.985
I'll get another one.
Besides, it's in my name.

25:33.058 --> 25:34.967
That's where you're wrong.

25:40.034 --> 25:42.271
"Michael Knight"?

25:42.338 --> 25:44.280
Michael Long is dead.
Remember that.

25:44.354 --> 25:46.241
How do I suddenly become
Michael Knight?

25:46.307 --> 25:48.216
Yes, well...

25:51.107 --> 25:53.758
Driver's license,
credit cards.

25:53.827 --> 25:56.216
It's all on Mr. Knight's orders.

25:57.251 --> 26:01.855
These are good now. You could have dated
these ahead if you wanted me to stay here.

26:01.924 --> 26:03.866
You knew I'd leave
when I wanted to.

26:03.940 --> 26:07.006
You're a primitive, Mr. Lon...
Mr. Knight.

26:07.076 --> 26:08.832
You're quite predictable.

26:08.900 --> 26:12.446
- You think the old man was pretty smart, don't you?
- A certifiable genius.

26:12.516 --> 26:15.996
He must've known what he was doing when he
picked me to get a little revenge for him.

26:17.188 --> 26:19.294
I'm on my way.

26:21.733 --> 26:25.475
Oh, just a minute. There are several things
about this car that I ought to explain.

26:25.540 --> 26:28.574
That's all right. I'm a fast study.
I'll pick things up as I go along.

26:28.645 --> 26:31.328
Look. Th-That's very foolhardy.

26:31.397 --> 26:34.812
Good-bye. Thank you.

26:34.885 --> 26:36.990
Oh, and I want you to know something.

26:37.061 --> 26:40.673
- I kind of got to like you.
- What?

26:40.742 --> 26:44.637
Never mind. What's that mean
coming from a primitive anyway?

26:52.007 --> 26:54.047
Well, Wilton,

26:54.118 --> 26:56.290
he's doing everything
you said he would.

26:56.358 --> 26:58.431
What have you gotten me into?

27:30.344 --> 27:33.574
Millston, in Silicon Valley.
110 miles.

27:36.169 --> 27:39.300
All right.
Might as well put on some music.

27:39.369 --> 27:42.435
With all these weird gadgets,
you'd think they'd give you a radio.

27:42.505 --> 27:45.800
What would you like to hear?
- What the hell was that?

27:50.281 --> 27:52.736
Do you wish further information
on Silicon Valley?

27:52.809 --> 27:57.120
Hell, no. I want to know who you are and how you're
listening in. There's no reason for increased volume.

27:57.193 --> 27:59.943
I am scanning your interrogatives
quite satisfactorily.

28:00.010 --> 28:04.288
I'm the voice of Knight Industry
Two Thousand's microprocessor.

28:04.363 --> 28:06.599
K.I.T.T. for easy reference.

28:06.666 --> 28:08.521
KITT, if you prefer.

28:08.586 --> 28:13.889
No, I don't prefer, and what's more, I don't intend
to drive around in a car that talks back to me.

28:13.963 --> 28:18.241
So, either Devon pulls your plug,
or you get yourself another driver.

28:18.315 --> 28:20.966
I am not qualified
to overrule your wishes.

28:21.036 --> 28:23.108
Well, that's real good to hear, KITT,

28:23.179 --> 28:27.238
because I don't want to hear another peep out
of you until I can get a call off to Devon.

28:27.308 --> 28:29.413
So clam up.
I'm gonna listen to some good music.

28:29.483 --> 28:33.226
And don't offer any suggestions.
I'll choose my own.

28:33.292 --> 28:35.147
As you wish, Mr. Knight.

28:35.212 --> 28:38.082
But since you are still recovering
from your ordeal,

28:38.156 --> 28:40.677
and I detect are in a slightly
irritable mood caused by fatigue,

28:40.749 --> 28:43.716
may I suggest you put the car in the
auto cruise mode for safety's sake?

28:43.788 --> 28:46.570
No, you may not.
And that's final.

28:46.637 --> 28:49.092
- Good night.
- Good night.

28:49.165 --> 28:52.067
I can't believe this.

28:52.141 --> 28:54.083
A car that talks back to me.

29:47.280 --> 29:49.135
Yoo-hoo, Michael.

29:53.360 --> 29:55.149
Hello, Michael.

30:04.401 --> 30:06.256
Did you see that?
What?

30:06.321 --> 30:08.688
That guy was plumb
asleep at the wheel. Nah!

30:10.769 --> 30:12.679
Hurry up.

30:21.490 --> 30:24.207
That man can't be asleep.
He's got to be dead.

30:24.275 --> 30:27.024
Well, if he ain't, he's gonna be.
That's Dead Man's Curve up ahead.

30:35.602 --> 30:37.391
How can he be asleep
and drive like that?

30:47.220 --> 30:49.129
Hey! Hey!

30:49.203 --> 30:51.789
Michael.

30:51.860 --> 30:54.194
Hey!

30:54.260 --> 30:56.748
Pull back.

30:56.820 --> 30:58.860
What the...

30:58.932 --> 31:00.820
What's going on?
What'd I do?

31:00.884 --> 31:02.739
Deny everything.

31:05.717 --> 31:10.802
If I may suggest, deafness is always a
good approach to law enforcement officers.

31:10.869 --> 31:14.415
You shut up. You were probably
weaving all over the road.

31:14.485 --> 31:15.892
Okay, out!

31:15.957 --> 31:18.608
I might also suggest
you display a slight kink in your neck...

31:18.677 --> 31:21.492
since you were driving
with your head against the window.

31:22.901 --> 31:25.771
- I said out!
- Why didn't you warn me?

31:25.846 --> 31:27.788
You told me to keep quiet.

31:27.862 --> 31:31.375
Who's he talkin' to? Nobody.
This boy's a hard-core alkie.

31:31.446 --> 31:33.748
Did you hear me?

31:33.814 --> 31:37.426
I said get out if you don't
wanna spend the night in jail.

31:37.495 --> 31:40.048
That's better. Now come on
out. Get the balloon out, Deke.

31:40.119 --> 31:41.974
I'm sorry, Officer.

31:42.039 --> 31:45.814
Could you speak in sign language...
Or a little slower.

31:45.879 --> 31:48.465
I haven't gotten
lipreading down yet.

31:48.535 --> 31:50.390
You mean you can't hear?

31:54.872 --> 31:58.516
Could you talk a little louder?
Into this ear... here.

31:58.583 --> 32:00.209
You mean you're deaf?

32:01.368 --> 32:04.302
Oh, that explains everything.

32:04.376 --> 32:07.027
I told you he couldn't drive
that smooth if he was drunk.

32:07.096 --> 32:09.006
What?

32:09.081 --> 32:11.983
He said...
Never mind!

32:12.057 --> 32:15.439
Just be on your way.
We're sorry we bothered ya.

32:15.512 --> 32:18.196
Uh, but keep your eye
on the rearview mirror.

32:18.265 --> 32:21.015
We've been flashing ya for miles.

32:21.081 --> 32:23.536
Yes, sir. I'll do that.

32:31.514 --> 32:36.216
Why do I get the feeling this isn't gonna be the
last time I'm gonna run into trouble in this town?

32:50.651 --> 32:53.946
"Comtron. " That looks like
a good place to start.

33:02.971 --> 33:06.103
Social gathering places
where alcoholic beverages...

33:06.172 --> 33:08.027
are consumed in quantity...

33:08.092 --> 33:11.289
can create an environment in which
indiscretion becomes commonplace.

33:11.356 --> 33:13.461
Just remember,
this is business, not pleasure.

33:13.532 --> 33:17.558
You're about as much fun as a divorce.
Which is not a bad idea.

33:17.628 --> 33:19.352
I want custody of me.

33:19.420 --> 33:22.715
I should have gotten rid of you before
I turned you on. Now I can't shut you up.

33:23.901 --> 33:25.788
Hi, ladies.

33:25.852 --> 33:27.958
Some guys sure start early.

33:29.469 --> 33:31.379
He's not our problem.

33:33.021 --> 33:34.581
Those guys are.

33:35.965 --> 33:38.267
Stick to business.

33:55.710 --> 33:57.466
Do you see what I see?
Mm-hmm.

34:02.207 --> 34:04.062
Yeah. And it's mine.

34:04.127 --> 34:06.713
- Say what?
- It's mine.

34:13.215 --> 34:15.998
I have died
and gone to automobile heaven.

34:22.208 --> 34:24.542
Cover me. Cover you, man?
Here? Are you out of your mind?

34:24.608 --> 34:29.081
- For this machine I am.
- Look here, Jackson. There's a right way and a wrong way to do things.

34:29.152 --> 34:31.356
And doing this here now is wrong.

34:32.416 --> 34:34.304
You may be right.

34:34.368 --> 34:36.824
Hey, I know I'm right.
This happens to be the most popular,

34:36.896 --> 34:38.751
not to mention
the most populated place in town.

34:38.817 --> 34:42.460
- There will come another time.
- That's a fact.

34:42.529 --> 34:44.536
And we will be ready.

34:57.153 --> 34:59.772
I'll need a credit card.
Yeah. Sure.

35:01.122 --> 35:04.471
Listen, do you happen to know those
people in the corner booth over there?

35:08.386 --> 35:10.241
Let me do you a favor.

35:10.307 --> 35:13.885
Unless you like waking up sucking dirt,
don't get interested in anyone at that table.

35:13.955 --> 35:17.916
Well, it wasn't anyone at that table
I'm curious about. It's somebody else.

35:17.987 --> 35:20.638
You know, I noticed they all came
across the street from Comtron.

35:21.987 --> 35:23.842
Yeah?

35:23.907 --> 35:26.558
Well, I'm trying to find
an old friend of mine that works there.

35:26.627 --> 35:28.482
I thought she might be able to help me.

35:28.548 --> 35:31.482
Well, I used to work there.
Who's your friend?

35:31.555 --> 35:34.108
Name's Tanya.
Tanya Walker.

35:36.068 --> 35:38.108
Hey! What's the matter with you?

35:38.180 --> 35:41.115
That's what I think of friends
of Tanya Walker. Hey, what happened?

35:41.188 --> 35:44.636
Nothin'. It was just an accident.
- Oh, it was no accident.

35:44.708 --> 35:47.327
Maggie, this is the last time
that I put up with your discourtesy.

35:47.397 --> 35:49.339
Hey, that's not necessary.

35:49.413 --> 35:52.315
Why don't you go hang out
with those Comtron bums?

35:52.389 --> 35:54.429
I can fight my own battles!

35:54.501 --> 35:57.697
Look, I'd better get out of here before
something else comes down. Yeah, right.

36:09.318 --> 36:11.390
I heard you mention Tanya Walker.

36:11.462 --> 36:13.317
You a friend?

36:13.382 --> 36:15.554
You're not gonna
throw anything at me, are ya?

36:15.622 --> 36:17.509
Why should I?
She's a friend of mine too.

36:17.575 --> 36:19.680
Yeah? You know how I can
get a hold of her?

36:19.751 --> 36:21.890
Oh, I'm afraid
she's already seeing someone.

36:21.959 --> 36:25.090
Well, I'm not interested in her body.
I'm interested in her money.

36:25.159 --> 36:27.167
Come again?

36:27.238 --> 36:29.759
I've got something to sell.
Something rather valuable.

36:29.831 --> 36:32.133
Like what?

36:32.199 --> 36:34.054
That's between her and me.

36:34.119 --> 36:36.705
Uh, who shall I tell her inquired?

36:36.776 --> 36:39.264
Tell her an old friend.

36:54.665 --> 36:57.086
Security. Gray speaking.
This is Tanya.

36:57.160 --> 36:59.582
Someone's come into town
and has been asking about me.

36:59.657 --> 37:01.566
I'll give you the car and the license.

37:01.641 --> 37:05.438
It's a new black Trans-Am with a
California license, lettering "KNIGHT."

37:05.513 --> 37:08.034
If it's another cop,
we'll handle it like we did the other ones.

37:08.106 --> 37:10.048
Exactly what I had in mind.

37:11.881 --> 37:13.769
Mmm.
Oh.

37:13.833 --> 37:17.129
Who you calling, love?
Oh, just our people in Security.

37:17.194 --> 37:21.122
As president of this company,
you're an irreplaceable asset,

37:21.194 --> 37:24.009
and I don't want anything
to happen to you tomorrow.

37:24.074 --> 37:27.620
You know how I worry about you
when you go out in public.

37:27.690 --> 37:29.730
Nothing's going to happen to me.

37:29.802 --> 37:33.283
Now, honey, in this day and age,
there are a lot of people out there...

37:33.355 --> 37:36.584
that would love to get their hands
on a rich man like you.

37:42.572 --> 37:44.459
Mmm.

37:45.611 --> 37:49.124
You just be grateful you have
somebody like me to take care of you.

37:58.252 --> 38:00.161
Maggie.
Get lost.

38:00.236 --> 38:02.146
I'm warning you.
This bag is full of mace.

38:02.221 --> 38:04.610
I stayed in my car
so I wouldn't scare you.

38:04.684 --> 38:07.368
Well, ain't you the David Niven.

38:08.429 --> 38:12.204
Look, I'm sorry about what happened
in there, but you misunderstood.

38:12.269 --> 38:14.691
I'm not a friend of Tanya's.
I just need to find her.

38:14.765 --> 38:16.619
Well, who cares?
Not me.

38:16.685 --> 38:20.678
She and that group of parasites of hers have taken
away everything that ever meant anything to me.

38:20.749 --> 38:23.116
My husband, my job, my house.

38:23.182 --> 38:25.571
I can't even afford
decent clothes for my kid.

38:28.398 --> 38:32.676
Now, please leave me alone, or I'll put a
dent in the middle of that machine. I mean it.

38:40.430 --> 38:43.245
I'll pay to get that fixed for ya.

38:43.310 --> 38:45.482
I don't believe it.

38:46.543 --> 38:49.096
How can I go through life
with luck this bad?

38:49.167 --> 38:51.437
I plow into your car
and my bumper falls off.

38:51.503 --> 38:56.871
Maggie, let me help you change your
luck. Why don't you just leave me alone?

38:56.944 --> 39:00.773
I just lost the last job
I'm ever gonna get in this town.

39:00.847 --> 39:04.328
What if Tanya and her crew
could be run out of Millston?

39:06.768 --> 39:09.964
Don't tell me. You're just about to
offer me a silver bullet.

39:10.032 --> 39:12.367
Just a chance to get even.

39:12.432 --> 39:14.953
For what?

39:16.208 --> 39:18.215
How much do you know
about what's going on here?

39:18.288 --> 39:22.315
- I was hoping you could tell me what I need to know.
- Why?

39:22.385 --> 39:25.352
- You really think you can make a difference?
- Yes!

39:25.425 --> 39:27.727
Now, will you help me?

39:31.825 --> 39:34.443
It's a regular boomtown.

39:34.513 --> 39:38.158
There's more money flowing through here now
than there was during the California gold rush.

39:38.226 --> 39:40.560
All because of tiny microchips.

39:40.626 --> 39:42.895
Yeah. Every calculator,

39:42.962 --> 39:46.061
every electronic kids' game...
They were all born right here.

39:46.130 --> 39:48.017
How do you fit into Silicon Valley?

39:49.907 --> 39:53.584
My husband came here to take a job
as head of security for Comtron.

39:53.650 --> 39:56.269
- Didn't work out?
- Oh, yes.

39:56.339 --> 39:58.193
It worked out just fine...

39:58.259 --> 40:02.220
till the president decided to hire
a brand-new executive assistant.

40:02.291 --> 40:04.363
- Tanya Walker.
- Yep.

40:04.435 --> 40:08.014
Before she rode
that flashy tail of hers to the top,

40:08.979 --> 40:11.697
Comtron was a relatively happy family.

40:12.948 --> 40:16.145
Then she came along, and she
started making wholesale changes.

40:16.212 --> 40:18.700
You mean your husband was fired?

40:18.772 --> 40:20.463
Not exactly.

40:22.932 --> 40:27.123
He couldn't accept what was going on,
and he started... poking into things.

40:28.212 --> 40:30.154
And one night he didn't come home.

40:30.229 --> 40:31.887
Disappeared?

40:31.956 --> 40:33.899
They found him dead in a gully.

40:33.972 --> 40:36.460
Said he'd been drinking.

40:36.533 --> 40:40.178
He didn't drink.
Not even beer.

40:40.245 --> 40:42.416
Maggie, how could they make that stick?

40:42.485 --> 40:44.340
Witnesses.

40:44.406 --> 40:48.781
Half a dozen truck drivers who hang out in that
place where I work. All animals who work for Comtron.

40:49.941 --> 40:52.941
You wouldn't have taken that job
to find some answers, would you?

40:54.774 --> 40:57.524
I took that job
to feed my little boy.

40:59.350 --> 41:01.968
This is where I live.

41:02.039 --> 41:04.210
I suppose you'd better come on up.

41:05.271 --> 41:07.638
Ay, señorita,
I was so worried.

41:07.703 --> 41:10.386
Luce, I'm sorry.
I... ran into something.

41:10.455 --> 41:13.008
I hope it was nothing serious.

41:13.079 --> 41:17.007
Oh. Oh, my goodness.
I hope it is something serious.

41:17.079 --> 41:19.600
Luce, please.
You're embarrassing me.

41:19.671 --> 41:22.389
Uh, this is Mr. Knight.

41:22.456 --> 41:25.489
- Tanto gusto.
- Luce takes care of my son.

41:25.559 --> 41:29.488
He's sleeping. Well, I'll be
leaving you two. Have a good time.

41:29.560 --> 41:32.429
Especially you.
She's a wonderful girl.

41:32.504 --> 41:34.544
A saint. Remember that.

41:34.616 --> 41:37.878
Good luck.
He's a winner.

41:40.409 --> 41:42.319
Yeah.

41:43.673 --> 41:45.528
I'm sorry.

41:45.593 --> 41:49.423
I don't know what to say. She doesn't usually
behave like that. No apologies. I'm flattered.

41:49.497 --> 41:52.531
Well, it's important to me
that you believe me.

41:54.073 --> 41:57.270
I haven't had a man in my apartment
since my husband was killed.

41:57.338 --> 41:58.745
Mom.

42:00.858 --> 42:02.767
Buddy.

42:02.842 --> 42:05.493
What are you doing out of bed?

42:07.034 --> 42:08.944
This is Buddy.

42:09.018 --> 42:11.222
I figured. Hi, Buddy.

42:11.290 --> 42:14.257
Hi. Are you gonna marry my mom?

42:14.330 --> 42:17.298
Oh! I don't believe
he just said that.

42:17.371 --> 42:20.666
Now will you go back to bed.
Right now. Just a minute.

42:20.731 --> 42:24.027
If I wanted to talk to Tanya alone,
where would I go?

42:24.091 --> 42:25.815
Just a second.

42:25.884 --> 42:28.633
Who's Tanya? Competition?

42:28.700 --> 42:32.344
Shh! Now you go to sleep.

42:34.396 --> 42:37.047
Look, I'd... I'd forget
trying to get to her off duty.

42:37.116 --> 42:39.025
I think she's staying
at Benjamin's estate.

42:39.100 --> 42:41.489
- William Benjamin.
- Mm-hmm.

42:41.564 --> 42:45.426
He owns Comtron,
and she rarely leaves his side these days.

42:45.500 --> 42:47.442
Now you go to sleep.

42:50.365 --> 42:55.034
Wait a minute. Uh, tomorrow's one day
that she and Benjamin do have to go out.

42:55.101 --> 42:57.751
Uh, Comtron's sponsoring
a charity show out at the track.

42:57.821 --> 42:59.764
The track?

42:59.837 --> 43:03.067
Yeah. It's a, uh,
demolition derby for charity.

43:03.133 --> 43:05.304
Buddy wanted to go.

43:05.373 --> 43:08.635
You see, in Silicon Valley, they have
so much money, they don't use junkers.

43:08.701 --> 43:10.741
Every plant is putting up
a brand-new car.

43:10.813 --> 43:12.723
People are just eating it up.

43:12.798 --> 43:16.093
- Can anybody enter?
- Oh, come on.

43:16.158 --> 43:18.460
Who can afford to get
his brand-new car totaled out?

43:18.526 --> 43:23.196
- Tell your son I'll be by to pick the both of you up at 10:00 tomorrow morning.
- Why? You mean we get to watch it?

43:23.262 --> 43:26.394
Yeah, you two get to watch.
I'll be in it.

43:26.463 --> 43:28.089
Yeah!

44:12.065 --> 44:14.454
What, uh...
What do you think?

44:15.522 --> 44:17.377
Piece of cake.

44:17.442 --> 44:20.638
- Michael, where on earth are you?
- You act as if you didn't know.

44:20.706 --> 44:24.022
- I'm not clairvoyant.
- You got a spy though.

44:24.098 --> 44:27.676
KITT? Don't be ridiculous.
He answers only to you,

44:27.746 --> 44:30.714
unless, of course, you're
incapacitated and release him. It.

44:30.787 --> 44:33.405
- Huh?
- It is an it.

44:33.475 --> 44:36.192
Not a he.
Don't ever forget that.

44:36.258 --> 44:38.462
I don't see
what difference that makes.

44:38.530 --> 44:41.530
That's because I'm the one out here
all by his lonesome.

44:41.603 --> 44:44.353
I'm a he.
I could get my face shot off, not it.

44:54.564 --> 44:57.378
- What's happened, Michael?
- Nothing so far, but I made contact.

44:57.444 --> 45:00.411
- Marvelous.
- Let's hope so. We'll know in a couple hours.

45:00.484 --> 45:02.939
- What happens in two hours?
- Demolition derby.

45:03.012 --> 45:06.329
Ah, that's splendid. Demolition...
What's a demolition derby?

45:06.405 --> 45:09.634
Well, it's where people enter
their cars in sort of a competition.

45:10.661 --> 45:12.516
It bent my pick!

45:12.581 --> 45:14.469
Come on. Quick pick.

45:14.533 --> 45:17.053
Sensational! We can't lose.
We have the best car on earth.

45:17.125 --> 45:20.541
- And what happens next?
- All the cars get demolished.

45:20.614 --> 45:23.843
That's not very funny.
Now, what really happens?

45:23.909 --> 45:25.316
That's what really happens.

45:25.381 --> 45:27.269
Ow!

45:28.230 --> 45:30.139
Here. You idiot.

45:30.214 --> 45:34.655
Don't be using a foot, man.
Use something that ain't gonna get hurt.

45:38.630 --> 45:40.572
Hey. Hey.

45:40.646 --> 45:43.013
Hey, Jackson. Jackson.

45:43.078 --> 45:44.988
Talk to me, man.

45:45.063 --> 45:48.805
Devon, if the car is everything
we think it is, we can't get hurt.

45:48.870 --> 45:52.187
But much of what we've designed
has yet to be proven in the field.

45:52.263 --> 45:55.296
I think it's safe to say, by the end
of the day, everything will be tested.

45:55.367 --> 45:58.117
For better or for worse.
Michael.

45:58.183 --> 46:00.223
Michael.

46:00.295 --> 46:02.467
Demolition derby indeed.

46:13.480 --> 46:16.829
I'm gettin' mad, man.
You understand? Mad!

46:16.905 --> 46:18.880
Yeah. Yeah, well,
I... I can understand that.

46:18.952 --> 46:21.822
That car will be mine.
Mine, you hear!

46:31.817 --> 46:33.759
Haven't we been graced
with a beautiful day...

46:33.834 --> 46:37.860
here at the Millston Speedway for the first
running of what we hope will be an annual event...

46:37.930 --> 46:40.232
the Comtron International
Demolition Derby.

46:40.298 --> 46:44.040
We've got a full field of beautiful brand-new
vehicles, right off the showroom floor.

46:44.106 --> 46:49.125
You're probably going to get to see them all turned
into a body shop bonanza before the end of this day.

46:52.554 --> 46:55.686
Wow, this is better than an auto show!

46:55.755 --> 46:57.860
Well, you better
take 'em all in now, Buddy.

46:57.931 --> 47:00.200
There's not gonna be a lot left of them
after the race.

47:00.266 --> 47:02.339
Maggie, why all these trucks
from Comtron?

47:02.411 --> 47:06.056
Well, because they're sponsoring the race
and providing the drivers.

47:08.363 --> 47:10.818
Oh, you're not really thinking
of entering your beautiful car?

47:10.891 --> 47:12.746
It's for charity, isn't it?

47:12.811 --> 47:15.397
Yeah, but it's also for people
who can afford it.

47:15.468 --> 47:17.443
I can't figure out
why you're doing this.

47:17.516 --> 47:19.371
I have my reasons.

47:19.436 --> 47:21.770
You're a strange man, Michael.

47:22.732 --> 47:25.667
You're nice, but you're strange.
Thanks, I think.

47:25.740 --> 47:28.009
Now let's get you two some seats
in owners' row, huh?

47:28.076 --> 47:29.832
Me in the owners' row?

47:29.901 --> 47:32.202
Oh, that'll frost 'em.

47:37.133 --> 47:40.482
Only about 20 minutes left, folks,
before we drop the green flag.

47:40.557 --> 47:43.405
We'd appreciate it now if you'd leave
the infield and the pit areas...

47:43.469 --> 47:46.568
and start making your way
to your seats for today's thriller.

47:46.638 --> 47:48.645
I understand this is where
I check in, Tanya.

47:54.862 --> 47:57.350
- I beg your pardon?
- I'm Michael Knight.

47:59.758 --> 48:02.180
Oh, you're the one that called.

48:02.255 --> 48:04.426
Then you were serious
about entering your car.

48:04.494 --> 48:07.462
- Dead serious.
- Well, your car will serve as the entry fee,

48:07.535 --> 48:10.185
but I wouldn't expect
much of it back if I were you.

48:10.255 --> 48:13.288
But the winning car
does receive a nice trophy,

48:13.359 --> 48:15.912
and the driver walks away
with 5,000 in cash.

48:15.983 --> 48:19.912
Oh, that's real nice.
I'll give the prize money to the charity.

48:19.984 --> 48:23.726
By the way, did anyone mention to you
that I was in town looking for you?

48:24.751 --> 48:26.606
As a matter of fact,
yes, they did.

48:26.671 --> 48:30.566
But I didn't understand the message,
and I don't deal with salesmen.

48:30.640 --> 48:32.266
You don't know what I'm selling.

48:32.336 --> 48:34.278
It wouldn't matter.
You wanna bet?

48:34.352 --> 48:37.385
After the race, you'll be
looking for me. I guarantee it.

48:37.456 --> 48:40.075
Come on, Tanya. Let's go,
let's go. The crowd's a-waitin'.

48:40.145 --> 48:44.847
Mr. Benjamin, I sure do admire your charity
work, and I'm very happy to do my little part.

48:44.912 --> 48:46.767
Doing your part?

48:46.833 --> 48:50.575
Yes, sir. You see, I'm the only independent
driver in this race, but it's still an honor.

48:51.601 --> 48:55.758
Uh, we don't allow jalopies
in this race, Mr...

48:55.825 --> 48:59.142
Knight. And my car's no jalopy,
as you can see.

48:59.217 --> 49:02.829
Well, you're a very generous man.

49:02.898 --> 49:06.314
Make sure the crowd appreciates his
gesture, Tanya. Thank you, Mr. Benjamin.

49:06.386 --> 49:09.452
Oh, I'll need two tickets
in the owners' row.

49:10.642 --> 49:13.839
Lonnie, would you give him
some owners' passes, please?

49:13.907 --> 49:15.816
I'd be glad to.

49:19.443 --> 49:21.931
Good-bye, Mr. Knight.

49:22.003 --> 49:24.108
Why are you so hostile?

49:24.179 --> 49:29.809
Come on. You're acting like there's a
kidnapper behind every tree. Come on.

49:29.876 --> 49:33.771
Here you go. Take your place
with the valley's finest.

49:33.844 --> 49:36.364
Oh, you're a doll.

49:36.436 --> 49:38.891
But I can't find Buddy.
I don't know where that kid's gone.

49:38.964 --> 49:42.761
Don't worry about him. He'll
turn up. A lot of cars to see.

49:42.836 --> 49:44.691
Michael,

49:44.756 --> 49:46.611
good luck, okay?

49:46.676 --> 49:48.586
Piece of cake.

49:52.180 --> 49:54.450
Our sleek field of cars are revving up.

49:54.517 --> 49:56.939
Getting ready to go.
The starter's in position.

49:57.013 --> 49:59.119
By the way, we've got a
new entry... Michael Knight,

49:59.189 --> 50:01.076
an independent driver
in a black Trans-Am.

50:01.141 --> 50:02.996
And the race is on!

50:03.061 --> 50:05.680
Remember, ladies and gentlemen,
this is a figure-eight track,

50:05.750 --> 50:08.685
and as the cars begin spreading out,
it becomes increasingly more difficult...

50:08.757 --> 50:11.889
to get through the intersection
without colliding with another car.

50:11.958 --> 50:14.325
So far, the cars have not attained
full speed.

50:14.390 --> 50:17.292
They're feeling each other out like
boxers in the first round of a title match.

50:17.366 --> 50:21.229
It's gonna be a great afternoon of
racing. We know you're going to enjoy it.

50:21.302 --> 50:25.329
Gosh! I've never seen anything like it. What are you
doing here? You're supposed to be with your mother.

50:25.399 --> 50:27.254
This is much more fun.

50:27.319 --> 50:30.166
Ooh, that was powerful.

50:30.231 --> 50:34.486
Aw, why'd you chicken out? Because you're
standing there ready to be flipped out of the car.

50:34.551 --> 50:37.683
Now get in that seat right now
and strap yourself down! Hurry up!

50:37.751 --> 50:39.726
Now, once again, ladies and gentlemen,

50:39.800 --> 50:43.116
the young independent is challenging on the
outside against a car weighing again half as much.

50:43.192 --> 50:45.875
Let's see if he backs down again.

50:45.944 --> 50:49.686
A tremendous race! Now it appears that
teammates are working on the young independent.

50:49.752 --> 50:52.273
- They've blocked him.
- Okay, KITT.

50:52.345 --> 50:56.600
I need to knock out about four feet. I'm gonna
put you on auto pursuit. You figure out the rest.

51:01.625 --> 51:04.691
Look at this! Michael Knight
in the black Trans-Am...

51:06.169 --> 51:08.503
He's gonna get through there.

51:08.569 --> 51:10.511
I'll be doggone!

51:13.081 --> 51:15.448
Oh, no! A tremendous collision!

51:15.513 --> 51:19.158
Yeah! You not only wiped him out,
you wiped out the truck too!

51:19.226 --> 51:23.252
These guys aren't supposed to hit my trucks.
Where'd you get these new drivers, Tanya?

51:23.321 --> 51:26.039
Thanks. I needed that.

51:26.106 --> 51:29.237
You're welcome. It's so good
to be communicating again.

51:29.306 --> 51:31.892
Golly! This car even talks.

51:31.962 --> 51:34.580
Oh, that was, uh...
That was just the radio, Buddy.

51:34.650 --> 51:38.262
No, it wasn't. I may just be a
little kid, but I'm not stupid.

51:38.330 --> 51:42.902
The car talked to you. It might be better if
we don't mention this to a whole lot of people.

51:42.971 --> 51:45.110
Like any, if you know what I mean.

51:45.179 --> 51:47.067
I think I know what you mean.

51:47.131 --> 51:49.782
And Carney Miller up front.
And Knight has got the lead.

51:49.851 --> 51:51.924
- Hey, Carney!
- Yeah?

51:51.995 --> 51:56.535
I figure this kids's trying to horn in
on some money that rightly belongs to us.

51:56.604 --> 51:59.768
- If you get my drift.
- Loud and clear.

51:59.836 --> 52:02.007
Let's give him a little room
to slide through.

52:02.076 --> 52:04.410
It's school days, pretty boy.
Come on!

52:04.476 --> 52:06.102
Demolition derby
and all about it.

52:06.172 --> 52:09.041
Oh, look at that!

52:10.589 --> 52:15.411
- Hey, how'd he do that?
- I don't know, but nobody makes a fool out of me.

52:16.829 --> 52:19.164
A piece of sheet metal
in a viselike maneuver,

52:19.229 --> 52:21.084
but Knight rocketed
right between 'em...

52:21.149 --> 52:23.386
and averted certain destruction.

52:23.453 --> 52:25.875
He hit us!
He can't do that.

52:25.949 --> 52:28.088
It's against NASCAR regulations.

52:28.157 --> 52:31.092
I don't think this is
a regulation race, Buddy.

52:31.166 --> 52:34.515
- I wonder what this button does.
- Don't start pushing things.

52:34.590 --> 52:36.183
I don't even know
what those things do.

52:36.254 --> 52:40.662
I'll tell you. When you're in a race like this,
you better have a good, firm grip on that wheel,

52:40.734 --> 52:42.643
because anybody...
Whoa! Here's a slide-out right now!

52:42.718 --> 52:44.660
Wow! All right!

52:44.734 --> 52:46.458
And a spinout by Dolan.

52:46.527 --> 52:48.861
And it appears
that Dolan is stalled over there.

52:48.926 --> 52:51.447
He'd better get that vehicle going fast.
He's a sitting duck.

52:51.519 --> 52:54.519
All right, Buddy.
Just sit tight and don't touch anything.

52:54.591 --> 52:56.696
A move on our lead car,
driven by Michael Knight,

52:56.767 --> 52:58.906
the daring independent
in that black Trans-Am.

52:58.975 --> 53:02.324
- This wily veteran has the equipment
to catch the Trans-Am.

53:03.808 --> 53:05.947
- Uh-oh. Smoke coming out...
- Hey! I can't see!

53:06.016 --> 53:08.437
And he may be disqualified.

53:10.368 --> 53:12.026
Oh! Crashes the barrier!

53:12.096 --> 53:14.201
Buddy, take your finger
off that button.

53:14.272 --> 53:16.574
Will Michael Knight
get the black flag?

53:16.640 --> 53:20.186
Nearing the end of the race, only
six cars left... And now only five...

53:20.256 --> 53:22.329
as the Caddy gets caught
in the intersection there.

53:22.401 --> 53:25.052
Knight's got trouble getting around
the Caddy, but he barely made it.

53:26.689 --> 53:29.340
Two more cars flying over that
Cadillac, our field is further reduced.

53:29.409 --> 53:33.053
And now it looks like... Oh! Here
comes the Lincoln into the pileup.

53:33.122 --> 53:36.438
Come to papa. Come to papa.

53:43.489 --> 53:45.312
And now only two are left.

53:45.378 --> 53:47.450
Now you're up against number one.

53:47.522 --> 53:50.938
All right, Buddy. You ready?
Ready.

53:51.011 --> 53:53.018
Here we go.

53:56.130 --> 53:58.465
That car's incredible, Tanya.

54:00.291 --> 54:04.252
A bump in the road
caused the Trans-Am to go airborne.

54:04.323 --> 54:06.941
And that means the only one
who got to the finish line...

54:07.011 --> 54:09.826
We won! We won! We won!

54:09.891 --> 54:13.055
It's Michael Knight!
As he takes the checkered flag.

54:13.124 --> 54:15.774
The amazing thing, from our point
of vantage, ladies and gentlemen...

54:15.844 --> 54:17.731
I want to know
all about that young man.

54:17.796 --> 54:19.836
That makes two of us.

54:19.908 --> 54:22.974
A demolition derby with a car coming
out without a scratch is unheard of.

54:23.044 --> 54:24.899
An absolute miracle.

54:24.965 --> 54:27.714
And Michael Knight,
the young independent from nowhere...

54:27.780 --> 54:30.847
and I mean literally
from nowhere...

54:30.917 --> 54:33.437
Tanya. You saw what I'm selling.

54:33.509 --> 54:36.575
If you want to know more,
meet me at the House of the Rising Sun.

54:36.644 --> 54:38.554
8:00.

54:40.709 --> 54:43.262
What did you find out about him?
He doesn't exist.

54:43.333 --> 54:46.629
We've checked his credit card numbers
from the club, car license... everything.

54:46.694 --> 54:49.182
Up until three months ago,
there was no Michael Knight.

54:49.254 --> 54:52.603
Well, phony credentials
don't surprise me.

54:52.678 --> 54:54.750
He said he's here
to sell me something.

54:54.822 --> 54:58.139
- Since when did we go public?
- Since I saw that car perform.

54:58.214 --> 55:02.143
Tanya, it's one thing to sneak out of
a development lab with secrets to sell,

55:02.214 --> 55:04.286
but quite another
to steal an entire prototype.

55:04.358 --> 55:06.693
I don't like it.
It smells like a setup.

55:06.759 --> 55:08.930
Did you run his fingerprints?

55:08.999 --> 55:11.584
I don't have any.
Anyway, that's a fallacy.

55:11.655 --> 55:14.503
Fingerprints are only on file
if somebody's got a criminal record.

55:14.567 --> 55:17.884
Or has worked for the government
in some law enforcement capacity.

55:17.959 --> 55:21.407
I can think of one way to get 'em,
but it might be a little messy.

55:22.727 --> 55:25.029
Well, I leave that entirely in your hands.

55:34.920 --> 55:37.571
Buddy, come on back here,
and you say thank you.

55:37.640 --> 55:40.837
Come on. Right now,
young man. Come on.

55:40.905 --> 55:43.393
Thank you!
I gotta go tell everybody!

55:43.465 --> 55:45.374
Okay.

55:48.937 --> 55:51.272
You don't look very happy.

55:51.337 --> 55:53.541
I thought it was a real nice day.

55:56.585 --> 55:58.495
Who are you really?

56:00.874 --> 56:02.849
I'm a friend.

56:02.922 --> 56:05.027
I'd like to be...
Michael.

56:06.826 --> 56:10.175
I still hurt from the last man
who made me feel...

56:13.834 --> 56:15.776
I can't go through it again.

56:17.579 --> 56:19.684
Maggie, it's okay.
I understand.

56:51.628 --> 56:53.930
Tell me I'm dreamin'.

56:53.996 --> 56:56.647
I see it, but I don't believe it.

56:59.725 --> 57:01.929
She's gonna meet me
at the Rising Sun at 8:00.

57:01.997 --> 57:05.096
Michael, I don't think it's likely
that she'll meet you alone. I know.

57:05.165 --> 57:08.678
But I doubt she'll get tough until she
satisfies herself that I'm here alone.

57:08.749 --> 57:10.637
You may have a point there.

57:10.702 --> 57:12.807
Only a fool would be out there
all by himself.

57:12.878 --> 57:15.115
The old man and I would
disagree with you on that one.

57:15.182 --> 57:19.044
There's two ways to fight a war, Devon.
With an army or all by yourself.

57:19.118 --> 57:21.257
But you can have an army.

57:21.326 --> 57:23.213
That's always been my point.

57:23.279 --> 57:26.213
But not the biggest army.
That's my point.

57:26.286 --> 57:28.970
If you can't outnumber 'em,
you're better off alone.

57:30.447 --> 57:32.040
Hey!

57:32.111 --> 57:34.697
Hey!

57:34.767 --> 57:36.676
Hey!

57:37.903 --> 57:40.521
You're gonna get
yourselves killed!

57:40.591 --> 57:42.152
Michael. Michael!

57:45.231 --> 57:47.850
Whoo-ooh!
Hey! Wow!

57:47.920 --> 57:49.807
Man, this thing
must make coffee too.

57:49.871 --> 57:52.871
I do nothing of the kind.
Now, pull over immediately.

57:52.944 --> 57:55.978
- Say what?
- I didn't say nothin'.

57:56.048 --> 57:57.958
Yeah, you did, man.
You said pull over.

57:58.032 --> 58:00.880
I didn't say pull over.
Hey, don't jive me, Browne.

58:00.944 --> 58:03.912
Because if you didn't say pull over,
somebody else did.

58:03.985 --> 58:05.643
That's right. I did.

58:06.865 --> 58:09.734
Who are you, dude?
That's irrelevant.

58:13.489 --> 58:17.767
You are not the proper owners of
this vehicle, so either you get out,

58:17.842 --> 58:19.751
or I will take the appropriate measures.

58:19.826 --> 58:22.892
Hey. Hey, hey.
All right!

58:22.962 --> 58:26.988
Now, I've heard of some far-out
burglar alarms, but this is heavy!

58:27.057 --> 58:29.097
All right, mama.
Do your baddest.

58:29.170 --> 58:31.723
Good heavens.
And I thought Michael was difficult.

58:37.843 --> 58:41.585
Gentlemen, I have attempted to
dissuade you from this wayward behavior.

58:41.651 --> 58:43.561
Rave on, machine.
Rave on!

58:43.634 --> 58:46.090
Wh-What do you think he is?
Some kind of tape recorder?

58:46.163 --> 58:50.058
Who cares, man? It's mine, and
I will do with it as I please.

58:50.131 --> 58:52.041
Watch this.

58:55.092 --> 58:57.001
Whoo-ooh!

58:58.804 --> 59:00.778
Yeah! Whoo-ooh! All right!

59:03.412 --> 59:06.761
Very juvenile.
Now watch this.

59:09.012 --> 59:11.565
Hey, man.
What's happening?

59:11.636 --> 59:13.644
Hey, look out!

59:13.717 --> 59:15.571
Whoa!

59:17.109 --> 59:19.084
Where you goin; man?
What are you doing?

59:19.157 --> 59:20.979
Hey, man.
I ain't doin' nothin'.

59:21.045 --> 59:23.980
Hey, well, don't go this way, man.
You're... You're taking us uptown.

59:24.054 --> 59:26.421
And I said I ain't doin' nothin'.

59:30.133 --> 59:32.719
Hey, man. Don't do that.
Man, I ain't doin' nothin'.

59:36.150 --> 59:38.059
I can't stop it!

59:41.206 --> 59:44.021
Come on, man. Stop this thing,
Jackson. Step on the brake or something.

59:44.086 --> 59:46.453
- I'm steppin' on it!
- Well, then push somethin'.

59:46.519 --> 59:49.421
I don't know what to push.
You push something.

59:49.495 --> 59:51.502
Hey, man. Where is this car
taking us?

59:51.575 --> 59:54.477
Hey, look out!

59:58.519 --> 01:00:00.406
Hey, man.
What's this car doing?

01:00:33.849 --> 01:00:35.791
Of all the irresponsible behavior.

01:00:35.865 --> 01:00:39.346
To leave me with my keys in the ignition
and my doors open?

01:00:39.417 --> 01:00:41.687
I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

01:00:43.193 --> 01:00:45.048
KITT.

01:00:47.770 --> 01:00:50.137
KITT.

01:00:50.202 --> 01:00:52.145
I said I was sorry.

01:00:54.587 --> 01:00:57.936
- What do you want from me?
- A little consideration would be a beginning.

01:00:58.010 --> 01:01:00.629
I have a lot on my mind,
and we got a lot of work to do.

01:01:00.699 --> 01:01:02.968
If it weren't for me,
you'd be walking.

01:01:03.035 --> 01:01:06.101
If it weren't for you, I'd be
missing our most important rendezvous.

01:01:06.171 --> 01:01:08.026
The whole point of my mission.

01:01:08.092 --> 01:01:10.645
I am very, very grateful to you.

01:01:10.716 --> 01:01:13.050
Our mission.

01:01:13.115 --> 01:01:16.018
Our mission. Forgiven?

01:01:16.091 --> 01:01:17.946
I suppose so.

01:01:18.011 --> 01:01:21.273
- After all, we're only human, right?
- Don't press your luck.

01:01:21.340 --> 01:01:22.801
It was just a thought.

01:02:04.702 --> 01:02:08.347
Well, uh, let's, uh,
go outside and talk about it.

01:02:08.415 --> 01:02:11.197
Well, I'm sorry,
but I'm here to meet a young lady.

01:02:11.262 --> 01:02:14.743
Uh, Miss Walker got the message.
She sent us to pick you up.

01:02:14.815 --> 01:02:18.393
Tanya did that?
You guys work for her too?

01:02:19.583 --> 01:02:21.755
Well, she suggested that we, uh,

01:02:21.823 --> 01:02:23.710
show you outsiders...

01:02:23.776 --> 01:02:26.907
what we do to people that come in here
and take away our little prize money.

01:02:26.975 --> 01:02:31.765
Oh, didn't Tanya tell you? I'm donating
my share of the prize money to the charity.

01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:34.425
Well, each of us got a little
donation for you too.

01:02:35.936 --> 01:02:38.554
Hold this.
No, no. I'm first.

01:02:38.624 --> 01:02:41.342
Well, listen, guys,
I hate to mention this, but, uh,

01:02:41.409 --> 01:02:44.671
I'm heavily trained in martial arts.

01:02:44.737 --> 01:02:46.646
Martial arts!

01:03:24.579 --> 01:03:27.579
I want that car examined from
top to bottom, inside and out.

01:03:27.651 --> 01:03:29.757
Yes, sir.
What's that gonna tell us?

01:03:29.828 --> 01:03:31.737
Who Michael Knight is working for.

01:03:31.811 --> 01:03:33.535
The car is gonna tell us that?

01:03:33.604 --> 01:03:36.571
Well, even cars that are specially
designed require stock parts,

01:03:36.644 --> 01:03:38.335
and they have serial numbers.

01:03:38.404 --> 01:03:43.587
Benjamin's engineers should be able to give us a
pretty good idea where the work was done and by whom.

01:03:45.732 --> 01:03:48.962
- You're where?
I'm in jail.

01:03:49.029 --> 01:03:51.396
But it's a trumped-up charge.
It always is.

01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:53.849
Look, I'm dead serious.

01:03:53.925 --> 01:03:56.860
The people we're after here
are practically running the town.

01:03:56.933 --> 01:03:58.788
Michael, where is the Knight 2000?

01:03:58.853 --> 01:04:01.952
I, uh... I'm not sure.
What do you mean you're not sure?

01:04:02.021 --> 01:04:05.054
How can you call me long distance
and tell me you've misplaced it?

01:04:05.125 --> 01:04:08.093
I didn't misplace it.
They impounded it.

01:04:08.166 --> 01:04:11.711
The trouble is, I think Comtron talked the
sheriff into letting them check out the car.

01:04:11.781 --> 01:04:15.043
Congratulations. You're living up to
my every expectation.

01:04:15.109 --> 01:04:16.735
There's no time for insults.

01:04:16.806 --> 01:04:19.359
What are we gonna do?
"We." That's wonderful.

01:04:19.430 --> 01:04:23.227
A couple of days ago, you practically drove
over my foot to be on your own. All right.

01:04:23.302 --> 01:04:25.407
I'm sorry.
I was a little hasty.

01:04:25.478 --> 01:04:28.413
Time's up, boy.
Let's get back to your cell.

01:04:28.487 --> 01:04:30.396
Devon, I'm telling you.
I'm counting on you.

01:04:30.470 --> 01:04:33.121
You come through now, we got these
people right where we want 'em.

01:04:33.191 --> 01:04:35.974
It'll take me a while to get there.

01:04:36.039 --> 01:04:39.683
- We may have to resort to other means... temporarily.
- What do you mean by that?

01:04:41.063 --> 01:04:43.846
Devon. Devon.

01:04:43.911 --> 01:04:46.595
Hey, did you guys cut me off?

01:04:46.664 --> 01:04:48.486
I demand another phone call.

01:05:01.608 --> 01:05:04.391
We've gone through three
diamond-bit drills.

01:05:04.457 --> 01:05:06.366
Perhaps I can explain.

01:05:11.689 --> 01:05:15.432
- What's this mean? I don't understand.
- The sheriff fingerprinted Knight when he was arrested.

01:05:15.497 --> 01:05:19.207
- These are the results.
- What's this mean? "No identification possible."

01:05:19.274 --> 01:05:21.183
Keep reading.

01:05:22.154 --> 01:05:25.416
- "Altered."
- "Expertly done."

01:05:26.378 --> 01:05:28.385
But still not the man's own prints.

01:05:33.675 --> 01:05:35.911
Hey, cowboy.

01:05:35.978 --> 01:05:37.888
Hey, I'm talking to you.

01:05:43.979 --> 01:05:47.078
Hey, I want to know
what that machine of yours is made of.

01:05:48.747 --> 01:05:51.714
Sit and spin.

01:05:54.892 --> 01:05:58.438
It's unraveling. Somebody from a very
high level is breathing down our necks.

01:05:58.508 --> 01:06:00.362
Now, it's time to get out.

01:06:00.428 --> 01:06:03.744
But we're just a few days from penetrating
all of Comtron's top secrets.

01:06:03.820 --> 01:06:05.675
We go for the main one.

01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:08.904
I have the access code to the
bubble memory chip from Benjamin.

01:06:08.972 --> 01:06:11.428
It's worth more
than all the others combined.

01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:14.730
Now, we get it out of the computer,
and we'll fly out tonight.

01:06:14.797 --> 01:06:16.804
Tanya, you're panicking over nothing.

01:06:16.877 --> 01:06:21.318
If he had any proof of anything, he wouldn't
be wasting his time at demolition derbies...

01:06:21.389 --> 01:06:23.276
or letting himself get locked up.

01:06:23.341 --> 01:06:26.408
- He'd tell the sheriff why he was here.
- Trust me.

01:06:26.478 --> 01:06:28.550
I had a feeling
when I looked in his eyes.

01:06:28.621 --> 01:06:30.923
He's no ordinary cop.

01:06:30.989 --> 01:06:33.291
He's far more dangerous.

01:06:33.357 --> 01:06:35.267
Now he has to be eliminated.

01:06:36.622 --> 01:06:38.989
Now you go get
Michael Knight out of jail,

01:06:39.054 --> 01:06:42.284
and I'll get the microchip design
out of the computer.

01:06:48.143 --> 01:06:50.958
You're making things worse.
First time in the can?

01:06:51.919 --> 01:06:55.716
No. I used to nose around for
Army Intelligence back in 'Nam.

01:06:57.327 --> 01:06:59.531
I got caught once by the 'Cong.

01:06:59.599 --> 01:07:01.541
Yeah? What happened?

01:07:01.615 --> 01:07:04.747
I had to punish 'em.
Oh, yeah?

01:07:05.903 --> 01:07:09.482
Yeah, well, look, I hope you don't take
what we did to you tonight personally.

01:07:10.832 --> 01:07:13.287
No, man. You look like
you already paid your price.

01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:15.465
Yeah. You got any friends
on the outside at all?

01:07:15.536 --> 01:07:18.471
I mean, you made one phone call,
but I don't think anybody showed up.

01:07:18.544 --> 01:07:21.326
- Yeah, I got one friend.
- Hey, that's good.

01:07:21.393 --> 01:07:24.110
But we're not on
the best of terms right now.

01:07:24.177 --> 01:07:26.316
Oh. That's bad.

01:08:14.067 --> 01:08:18.290
Those other drivers...
The ones that tried to beat me up...

01:08:18.354 --> 01:08:20.210
they local boys?
Nah.

01:08:20.274 --> 01:08:22.479
We all got hired by Wilson,
the new security chief.

01:08:22.546 --> 01:08:24.937
I heard about it in stir
when I was gettin' my parole.

01:08:25.011 --> 01:08:27.468
Pay is good,
don't have to break too many laws.

01:08:27.540 --> 01:08:31.883
You ever wonder why a nice, polite
electronics company needs strong-arm boys?

01:08:35.988 --> 01:08:38.256
I don't ask those kind of questions.

01:09:07.158 --> 01:09:10.607
Deputy, I have a court order
for Mr. Knight's release.

01:09:15.511 --> 01:09:19.154
Okay. I guess he's yours.

01:09:38.104 --> 01:09:40.438
What's going on back there?

01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:48.401
- I don't believe this.
- Must be a drunk. See if he hurt himself.

01:09:48.473 --> 01:09:52.270
I won't even ask you how you did
this, KITT, but thanks. You're welcome.

01:09:52.345 --> 01:09:54.133
Who you talking to?
There's nobody in there.

01:09:54.201 --> 01:09:56.111
What in the...

01:10:02.266 --> 01:10:05.233
Those bullets are just
bouncing off that windshield!

01:10:18.426 --> 01:10:20.336
Knight's escaped.
Let's go.

01:10:45.372 --> 01:10:47.990
Well, it's no use
trying to catch that machine.

01:10:49.148 --> 01:10:51.155
Then how are we gonna stop him?

01:10:51.228 --> 01:10:54.490
He must be heading out of town.
There's nothing else out this way.

01:10:56.412 --> 01:10:58.267
Oh, yes, there is.

01:11:06.717 --> 01:11:08.659
Now how do I get up there?

01:11:08.734 --> 01:11:12.509
It's times like this I wish I listened
more closely to Devon.

01:11:12.574 --> 01:11:14.200
Is it all right to respond?

01:11:14.270 --> 01:11:16.790
Yes, yes. It's all right.
Look, KITT,

01:11:16.862 --> 01:11:20.343
I gotta get up to a roof about
a hundred feet.

01:11:20.414 --> 01:11:24.156
Very well. If you'll set the pressure
adjustment for precisely 600 pounds,

01:11:24.222 --> 01:11:26.110
you should land quite gently.

01:11:26.174 --> 01:11:29.971
That's it? I just set the
pressure and hit the button?

01:11:30.047 --> 01:11:32.218
It would help
if you also opened the auto roof.

01:11:32.286 --> 01:11:34.326
Smart-aleck car.

01:11:38.399 --> 01:11:40.253
Okay.

01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:57.659
You guys aren't gonna
believe this, but it's back.

01:11:57.728 --> 01:12:00.663
What... What do you mean
it's back? Back where?

01:12:00.736 --> 01:12:02.743
Right out here
on the south parking lot.

01:12:22.402 --> 01:12:24.922
Okay. Let's see.

01:12:26.370 --> 01:12:27.799
Third floor.

01:12:35.906 --> 01:12:37.761
Where's Knight?

01:12:37.826 --> 01:12:40.215
I don't know. He busted out
of jail. You think he's here?

01:12:40.291 --> 01:12:43.586
- There's no way he can get in without being seen.
- How much do you wanna stake on that?

01:12:43.651 --> 01:12:46.018
I'm gonna go back up
to secure the microchip design.

01:12:46.083 --> 01:12:48.833
Now, you tell the guards
to shoot to kill.

01:13:53.287 --> 01:13:55.142
Yes.

01:13:55.207 --> 01:13:59.037
No, everything's okay. I've got
the microfilm, the new memory chip.

01:13:59.111 --> 01:14:02.624
I'll be leaving for the airfield soon.
Alert the pilot.

01:14:02.695 --> 01:14:05.346
Tell him I'm flying out
on Benjamin's orders.

01:14:05.415 --> 01:14:07.619
Pick up Knight
and meet me at the field.

01:14:07.688 --> 01:14:10.338
Very kind of you to organize
the evidence for me, Tanya.

01:14:10.408 --> 01:14:11.968
Look. Don't do this.

01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:15.423
Whoever you work for
can't be worth what I can do for you.

01:14:15.496 --> 01:14:18.310
Would you prefer this?

01:14:18.376 --> 01:14:20.285
It's not a starry night in Nevada,

01:14:21.352 --> 01:14:23.294
but it'll hurt just as much.

01:14:26.408 --> 01:14:27.870
Michael Long.

01:14:29.769 --> 01:14:31.874
Look, please don't do this.

01:14:31.945 --> 01:14:33.855
If I hadn't done it,
Wilson would have.

01:14:33.929 --> 01:14:36.231
He would have shot you.
He gives the orders.

01:14:36.297 --> 01:14:40.160
We... We could share millions. How can we share
the millions, Tanya, if you're not the boss?

01:14:40.233 --> 01:14:43.430
Come on, Tanya. You're
the boss. No one else.

01:14:43.497 --> 01:14:45.407
All right. I'm the boss.

01:14:46.538 --> 01:14:48.447
But we need somebody like you.

01:14:48.522 --> 01:14:52.516
I promise you a very rewarding...
Partnership.

01:14:52.586 --> 01:14:55.303
Not this time.

01:14:55.370 --> 01:14:57.475
All right. Hold it right there.
Shoot him.

01:15:05.322 --> 01:15:07.395
I want every guard to check in.

01:15:15.371 --> 01:15:18.054
I'll take Personnel.
You take Accounting.

01:15:51.309 --> 01:15:54.157
Nothing in Personnel.
What about you, Baker?

01:15:54.222 --> 01:15:56.164
Baker? Baker.

01:15:56.238 --> 01:15:58.540
Nothing here.

01:15:58.606 --> 01:16:00.297
Well, that wasn't Baker.

01:16:03.118 --> 01:16:05.027
Halt.
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

01:16:05.102 --> 01:16:07.917
- It's Baker.
- What's goin' on?

01:16:07.982 --> 01:16:11.430
Wilson. He wants you up in...
In the administration building.

01:16:11.503 --> 01:16:15.180
All guards be aware that Baker's
uniform has been stolen. Repeat.

01:16:15.246 --> 01:16:18.181
The suspect is now wearing
a guard's uniform.

01:16:18.255 --> 01:16:21.255
W... W...
Hold it right there, Knight.

01:16:21.327 --> 01:16:24.142
I've got him. Dead in my sight.
Right out here next to his car.

01:16:24.207 --> 01:16:28.136
Don't let him move so much as an inch, and
you've got yourself 10,000 in cash, boy.

01:16:28.208 --> 01:16:30.695
Yes, sir.

01:16:30.767 --> 01:16:32.556
Let's go.

01:16:32.624 --> 01:16:34.479
Almost made it.

01:16:34.544 --> 01:16:37.327
But I was just a little
too smart for you, fella.

01:16:37.392 --> 01:16:39.334
Sorry.

01:16:39.408 --> 01:16:41.317
Don't look behind you.

01:16:44.528 --> 01:16:46.383
Oh, no. No.

01:16:46.449 --> 01:16:48.521
There's no one behind me
for 200 yards.

01:16:48.593 --> 01:16:52.871
- What about the car?
- There's no one in there either. I looked.

01:16:58.898 --> 01:17:01.483
No, no, don't kill me.

01:17:01.553 --> 01:17:04.652
Don't kill me. I got a dog
at home. I got a sick mother.

01:17:04.721 --> 01:17:07.623
All right. Toss your weapon
down and get against the wall.

01:17:30.739 --> 01:17:33.008
That Trans-Am's loose
and heading right for us.

01:17:39.828 --> 01:17:41.355
Look out!

01:17:51.668 --> 01:17:55.116
KITT. KITT, you there?

01:17:55.189 --> 01:17:57.578
Where would I go?

01:17:57.653 --> 01:17:59.508
Look, I know we've had
some misunderstandings,

01:17:59.573 --> 01:18:02.388
but I'm not so sure I'm gonna be
around at the end of this trip.

01:18:02.453 --> 01:18:05.748
If it's of any assurance,
your vital signs are still quite good,

01:18:05.813 --> 01:18:08.431
but you do need
immediate medical attention.

01:18:08.501 --> 01:18:10.356
We can't stop, pal.

01:18:10.421 --> 01:18:13.105
They're gonna be
coming at us from all directions now.

01:18:14.070 --> 01:18:17.070
What can I do? Any way you
can get in touch with Devon?

01:18:17.142 --> 01:18:21.004
You could reach him on the microwave
mobile line. He's en route to Millston.

01:18:21.078 --> 01:18:22.834
Good. Do it. Do it fast.

01:18:25.750 --> 01:18:27.441
What in the name of heaven
is going on?

01:18:27.510 --> 01:18:31.766
Devon. Devon, they were gonna kill me.
They would have if it weren't for KITT.

01:18:31.830 --> 01:18:35.245
Michael, what's wrong?
KITT, what's the matter with Michael?

01:18:35.318 --> 01:18:37.173
I'm afraid Mr. Knight's been injured.

01:18:37.238 --> 01:18:39.278
His vital signs are deteriorating rapidly.

01:18:39.351 --> 01:18:42.068
He's losing blood.
I really feel I should take over.

01:18:42.135 --> 01:18:44.436
You're not taking over anything.
You hear me?

01:18:44.504 --> 01:18:46.805
Michael, forget everything.
Save yourself.

01:18:46.872 --> 01:18:49.108
We can regroup to fight another day.

01:18:49.175 --> 01:18:51.063
Don't worry, Devon.

01:18:51.127 --> 01:18:53.713
- I'm gonna take us out winners.
- What have you learned?

01:18:53.784 --> 01:18:56.402
Tanya and her buddies
are about to rip off Comtron.

01:18:56.472 --> 01:18:58.228
Can you prove that?

01:18:58.296 --> 01:19:00.980
Right now they're trying to
get away with millions of dollars...

01:19:01.048 --> 01:19:02.936
worth of Comtron secrets.

01:19:03.001 --> 01:19:06.798
- I'll contact the local police immediately.
- Forget that. They've been bought.

01:19:06.873 --> 01:19:09.491
Contact the F.B.I. Or the state police,
have them standing by.

01:19:09.561 --> 01:19:12.114
Standing by where? They're making
a run for it to the airport.

01:19:12.185 --> 01:19:15.087
I'm going after 'em.
KITT, can he make it?

01:19:15.161 --> 01:19:17.528
You want the truth?
In front of him?

01:19:17.593 --> 01:19:20.277
If I'm goin' out,
I'm taking them with me.

01:19:27.257 --> 01:19:29.112
This is Chief of Security Wilson.

01:19:29.177 --> 01:19:31.512
Patch me in
to Comtron truck dispatch.

01:19:31.578 --> 01:19:35.353
I want everything we've got on the road
to stand by for special instructions.

01:19:57.275 --> 01:19:59.763
Great.
- What is?

01:19:59.836 --> 01:20:02.291
I just figured out how
they intend to stop me.

01:20:02.364 --> 01:20:05.266
Okay, KITT.
With all due respect,

01:20:05.340 --> 01:20:07.347
you aren't possibly considering...

01:20:09.148 --> 01:20:11.090
Oh, my word. You are.

01:20:11.165 --> 01:20:14.710
That's right, baby.
Come to papa.

01:20:17.436 --> 01:20:19.346
Hey.

01:20:19.421 --> 01:20:21.526
Hey. That guy's nuts!

01:20:21.597 --> 01:20:26.169
If you're going through with this, may I suggest
you permit me to activate the turbo boost?

01:20:26.237 --> 01:20:28.604
- The what?
- Never mind. Allow me to demonstrate.

01:20:46.558 --> 01:20:47.835
I'm gonna kill him.

01:20:47.902 --> 01:20:50.804
I gotta admit,
this car is something else.

01:20:50.879 --> 01:20:53.367
KITT. KITT, are you there?

01:20:53.439 --> 01:20:57.498
- Come on, buddy. We both can't pass out.
- We aren't speaking.

01:20:59.103 --> 01:21:01.143
At least I know you're all right.

01:21:01.215 --> 01:21:03.103
Then you really do care.

01:21:03.167 --> 01:21:07.422
- Yeah, I care, but don't tell anybody, okay?
- Okay.

01:21:10.688 --> 01:21:12.477
Dolan. Come in, Dolan.

01:21:12.544 --> 01:21:15.064
Did you get him?

01:21:15.135 --> 01:21:17.077
I blocked the road and cut him off.

01:21:17.152 --> 01:21:20.862
Good work. Yeah, but he went right
through the side of my trailer.

01:21:20.928 --> 01:21:24.092
- Have you been drinking?
- Not yet, but I plan on it.

01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:27.576
I'm telling ya. There ain't no way
you're gonna stop that thing.

01:21:32.609 --> 01:21:35.806
Attention all drivers. Attention all drivers.

01:21:35.873 --> 01:21:38.556
Anybody wanting a $15,000 bonus...

01:21:38.625 --> 01:21:40.480
is to smash that Trans-Am head-on.

01:21:40.546 --> 01:21:42.400
Do you read me?
I said head-on.

01:21:42.466 --> 01:21:45.815
He's currently heading north
on Highway 17.

01:21:45.890 --> 01:21:49.949
This is Truck 41 on 17.
You're nuts.

01:21:50.018 --> 01:21:52.319
What good's $15,000
if you're dead?

01:21:52.386 --> 01:21:54.241
Well, jump clear, you idiot.

01:21:54.306 --> 01:21:56.248
But make sure you level that Trans-Am.

01:21:56.322 --> 01:21:58.231
Forget it.

01:22:00.674 --> 01:22:05.726
Make it $25,000 to the first man
that smashes and levels that Trans-Am.

01:22:05.795 --> 01:22:08.642
Do you read me? $25,000.

01:22:09.731 --> 01:22:13.080
- All right. I'll give it a shot.
- Devon, did you hear that?

01:22:13.155 --> 01:22:16.538
I'm afraid so.
You know what KITTcan do. Can he do it?

01:22:16.611 --> 01:22:20.321
I can't recall ever having put him
to that precise test.

01:22:20.387 --> 01:22:22.176
Oh, great.

01:22:22.243 --> 01:22:25.407
I suggest we'd better reach the airport
before we reach the truck.

01:22:25.475 --> 01:22:27.745
You know something, KITT.

01:22:27.812 --> 01:22:29.754
I think you're right.

01:22:29.828 --> 01:22:33.821
Where are you, 41?
Just coming up to the airport turnoff.

01:22:33.892 --> 01:22:36.282
Oh, yeah. I see you.

01:22:36.356 --> 01:22:39.586
You've got him.
Just over the next rise.

01:22:39.653 --> 01:22:42.522
Here. Just in case he gets by.

01:22:45.413 --> 01:22:47.420
We should be seeing them
any minute now.

01:22:48.837 --> 01:22:52.482
No one survives a head-on collision
with a semi. No one.

01:22:52.550 --> 01:22:54.459
Mr. Knight, this is foolhardy.

01:22:54.533 --> 01:22:59.040
- I really must assume control.
- Negative. I'm driving this machine.

01:22:59.110 --> 01:23:02.623
Devon, Michael is in no condition
to be making decisions.

01:23:02.694 --> 01:23:06.404
KITT, I'm afraid as long as he's conscious
and in the driver's seat, we have no choice.

01:23:06.470 --> 01:23:08.609
An absurd set of circumstances.

01:23:08.678 --> 01:23:10.620
Too bad, KITT.

01:23:10.695 --> 01:23:14.437
The guy who designed you
believed in the strength of the individual.

01:23:14.502 --> 01:23:17.056
We may have to put that to the test.

01:23:20.199 --> 01:23:21.987
He isn't stopping.

01:23:22.055 --> 01:23:24.543
The man's nuts.
Well, I hope so.

01:23:24.615 --> 01:23:28.292
- Any last thoughts, KITT?
- I wish you hadn't put it that way.

01:23:31.111 --> 01:23:35.650
- He's heading right for him.
- We'll need a magnifying glass and tweezers just to find him.

01:23:35.720 --> 01:23:36.799
Or a blotter.

01:23:38.440 --> 01:23:40.065
I got him in sight.

01:23:40.136 --> 01:23:42.722
Remember, 25 big ones
if you nail him.

01:23:54.921 --> 01:23:58.237
- That car just jumped over the truck.
- Don't be ridiculous.

01:24:00.041 --> 01:24:02.889
- That's about as close as you can get.
- Tell me about it.

01:24:02.953 --> 01:24:05.571
Take her down. It's up to us.

01:24:15.562 --> 01:24:17.701
- He hit us.
- No, you hit us.

01:24:17.770 --> 01:24:20.902
Shut up and make another pass. You want
to make another pass, you can jump out.

01:24:20.971 --> 01:24:22.858
We'll be lucky to make the airport.

01:24:54.700 --> 01:24:56.871
You get him?
Does it look like it?

01:24:56.941 --> 01:24:59.624
Let's get that aircraft rolling.

01:24:59.692 --> 01:25:01.994
Not till I finish Knight.
Forget it. Let's go.

01:25:29.743 --> 01:25:32.743
You'd better let me take over.
Your reflexes can't handle it.

01:25:32.815 --> 01:25:36.427
It's two out in the bottom of the
ninth, KITT. I'll finish the game.

01:26:19.537 --> 01:26:22.123
Run for the hangar.
We've gotta find another way out.

01:26:22.194 --> 01:26:24.812
I'll get you a way out of here
that nothing can stop.

01:26:26.065 --> 01:26:28.040
Tanya, come back here.

01:26:29.266 --> 01:26:31.176
You lose, Michael.

01:26:31.249 --> 01:26:33.038
No, Tanya. Don't!

01:26:33.106 --> 01:26:34.154
The windows are...

01:26:47.859 --> 01:26:49.801
It's over, KITT.

01:26:49.875 --> 01:26:51.785
It's all yours.

01:26:52.883 --> 01:26:55.752
I'm getting you to a hospital
as soon as possible.

01:27:07.188 --> 01:27:10.254
Michael, are you sure you're all right?
Yeah.

01:27:10.324 --> 01:27:13.586
I'm a little stiff, a little sore,
but the doc says I'm mobile.

01:27:14.580 --> 01:27:16.555
That's good.

01:27:17.588 --> 01:27:20.370
I don't know what I'm gonna do
with Buddy now that you're leaving.

01:27:20.437 --> 01:27:22.477
Oh, I'd keep him.
He's a real good kid.

01:27:22.549 --> 01:27:24.556
You know what I mean.

01:27:25.620 --> 01:27:28.435
He needs a man.
I can see that now. I...

01:27:29.845 --> 01:27:32.977
I guess I thought
I could just go on not caring.

01:27:35.254 --> 01:27:37.109
And not looking.

01:27:37.174 --> 01:27:39.029
Stupid, huh?

01:27:39.094 --> 01:27:42.574
Here I had a prime candidate
right under my nose, and I...

01:27:42.645 --> 01:27:44.555
I chased him away.

01:27:44.630 --> 01:27:47.118
Ah, don't consider it
a permanent condition.

01:27:48.151 --> 01:27:50.452
You mean that?

01:27:50.519 --> 01:27:52.974
I mean, you might
come back and visit us sometime?

01:27:54.070 --> 01:27:55.980
Tell Buddy it's a promise.

01:27:58.391 --> 01:28:00.278
Oh.

01:28:07.287 --> 01:28:10.997
You know, he, uh... He was hoping you'd
take him for one last ride in your car.

01:28:11.063 --> 01:28:15.057
Yeah, well, that might be
one small problem.

01:28:15.128 --> 01:28:17.550
Only you could have
dented this car.

01:28:17.624 --> 01:28:20.755
Hey. I'm sorry.
Nothing's perfect.

01:28:20.824 --> 01:28:23.574
When do I get it back? Who said
anything about getting it back?

01:28:23.640 --> 01:28:26.640
Devon, it's my car.
I have the registration.

01:28:26.712 --> 01:28:28.622
Don't remind me.

01:28:28.696 --> 01:28:31.860
You know, I'd like to be
getting on with my work soon.

01:28:37.465 --> 01:28:40.564
Very well.
Step aboard. We'll discuss it.

01:28:48.089 --> 01:28:50.708
Now then, about my car.

01:28:51.769 --> 01:28:56.080
Well, simply stated, Wilton Knight
was my friend as well as my employer.

01:28:56.154 --> 01:29:00.497
And my legacy is to see that his final
dream is faithfully pursued, like it or not.

01:29:00.570 --> 01:29:02.643
Your options are still open.

01:29:02.715 --> 01:29:05.944
- You don't have to...
- Devon, the old man wanted me.

01:29:06.011 --> 01:29:07.866
It was his dying request.

01:29:07.931 --> 01:29:10.419
Yes, to rid the world
of Tanya and her friends.

01:29:10.491 --> 01:29:13.142
But the rest of his dream
would bore you to tears.

01:29:13.211 --> 01:29:16.724
The majority of our activity here
involves legal research,

01:29:16.795 --> 01:29:20.112
class-action suits...
Strictly bureaucratic stuff.

01:29:20.187 --> 01:29:22.740
- What else?
- What else?

01:29:22.811 --> 01:29:26.968
- Yeah, the part he wanted me for.
- Well, Mr. Knight also believed that under certain circumstances,

01:29:27.036 --> 01:29:29.938
direct action might be
the only feasible solution.

01:29:30.012 --> 01:29:33.046
That's what the Knight 2000
was designed for.

01:29:33.116 --> 01:29:37.873
The pilot program consists of one
man and one car. Absurd really.

01:29:37.949 --> 01:29:40.851
I mean, who would want to
take on such a thing?

01:29:40.925 --> 01:29:43.795
I was supposed to be
that man, wasn't I?

01:29:43.868 --> 01:29:46.519
Well, he seemed to feel that you were
singularly well-qualified...

01:29:46.589 --> 01:29:48.662
to "go it alone, "as he put it.

01:29:48.733 --> 01:29:52.956
But who could expect it of you? I mean, you barely
came through this misadventure with your life.

01:29:53.021 --> 01:29:55.672
Not to mention the damage
to the Knight 2000.

01:29:55.741 --> 01:30:01.109
I spent years of my life fighting criminals of one type
or another who always had the upper hand, and now this.

01:30:01.182 --> 01:30:04.663
It's a loner's dream. It's been
handed to me on a silver platter.

01:30:04.733 --> 01:30:07.930
The world's most fantastic car.

01:30:07.998 --> 01:30:11.162
All the money and all the resources
of the Knight Foundation.

01:30:12.447 --> 01:30:16.189
And most of all, the best chance
I'll ever get to prove that one man...

01:30:16.254 --> 01:30:18.164
really can make a difference.

01:30:18.239 --> 01:30:21.784
I was afraid
that would be your attitude.

01:30:22.783 --> 01:30:24.692
Well,

01:30:26.143 --> 01:30:28.664
shall we drink to what may be
the start of, um...

01:30:28.735 --> 01:30:30.590
Of what?

01:30:30.655 --> 01:30:32.565
One man's dream.

01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:35.927
And to our future.

01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:39.229
No matter who it may
take us up against... or where.
