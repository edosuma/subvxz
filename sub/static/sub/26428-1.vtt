ISMAEL'S GHOSTS

00:44.400 --> 00:45.800
Ivan Dedalus...

00:50.600 --> 00:51.920
Ivan...

00:52.640 --> 00:54.320
Dedalus.

01:00.320 --> 01:02.360
Ministry Of Foreign Affairs

01:05.080 --> 01:06.440
Hello.

01:13.720 --> 01:15.000
Jacques!

01:15.280 --> 01:16.120
Hello!

01:16.600 --> 01:18.440
-You're here?
-Yes!

01:18.880 --> 01:22.080
-You're Parisian now?
-No.

01:22.600 --> 01:25.720
I'm just passing through.
Is Dedalus still in the vicinity?

01:25.920 --> 01:28.120
Dedalus was stationed in Vienna.

01:28.400 --> 01:30.040
But no news since.

01:30.240 --> 01:33.240
-Not at the Ministry.
-You're sure he's still with us?

01:33.480 --> 01:36.120
-He fell off the radar.
-What radar?

01:36.360 --> 01:39.280
Are you looking for him?
Investigating?

01:39.560 --> 01:41.640
I'm passing through.
I was wondering.

01:41.840 --> 01:43.880
Ivan disappeared. So I'm asking.

01:44.080 --> 01:45.280
I told my wife

01:45.480 --> 01:47.480
"We're spending three years
in Vilnius."

01:47.680 --> 01:49.360
-Where?
-That's what she said.

01:49.560 --> 01:51.240
She wanted London or Trinidad.

01:51.440 --> 01:53.880
She hasn't spoken to me
for two weeks.

01:54.080 --> 01:54.920
Poor you!

01:55.120 --> 01:57.720
I'm too old for Vilnius.
I feel the cold easily.

01:57.920 --> 02:00.320
Anyway, Vilnius is too much for me.

02:01.480 --> 02:05.680
And yet I packed my bags
and began learning Lithuanian.

02:06.960 --> 02:10.520
So I got to Prague
to meet the Ukrainian delegation.

02:10.720 --> 02:14.040
Top secret. They start
talking about the Russians.

02:14.240 --> 02:17.000
I ask the First Secretary...
-Who was it?

02:17.280 --> 02:20.000
That guy, a little strange...

02:20.680 --> 02:21.640
Dedalus!

02:21.840 --> 02:24.000
-Of course!
-Our best man.

02:24.200 --> 02:25.760
Passport, please.

02:26.360 --> 02:27.640
Thanks.

02:30.640 --> 02:31.960
Who's Dedalus?

02:32.160 --> 02:33.680
I came here to speak to him.

02:33.880 --> 02:35.240
But Ivan disappeared.

02:35.440 --> 02:36.920
It was his specialty.

02:37.160 --> 02:38.320
Meaning?

02:38.520 --> 02:40.160
You remember the rumors.

02:40.360 --> 02:43.520
I'm not alone
to have thought at times he was...

02:43.720 --> 02:45.640
-An angel.
-Or a spy.

02:45.840 --> 02:46.760
-No.
-Yes.

02:49.760 --> 02:51.160
An interior agent?

02:51.360 --> 02:53.120
Why would he be interior?

02:53.320 --> 02:54.480
How did he get in?

02:54.680 --> 02:58.720
He came out of nowhere at 35,
no diploma, unlikely face.

02:58.920 --> 03:02.360
Best score, external candidate.
Too good to be true.

03:02.840 --> 03:04.280
Mr. Dedalus?

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
You know who really liked Ivan?

03:09.200 --> 03:10.880
He hired him, mentored him!

03:11.080 --> 03:13.840
-Claverie!
-That traitor!

03:14.040 --> 03:16.160
Claverie. 30 years on the job.

03:16.360 --> 03:18.240
Stationed in Warsaw under Gierek.

03:18.440 --> 03:20.240
Thought to be a communist mole.

03:20.440 --> 03:23.080
Then they said
the Americans recruited him.

03:23.280 --> 03:24.800
In Asia, rumors of corruption.

03:25.000 --> 03:28.960
Quai d'Orsay found nothing.
But he was put out to pasture.

03:29.680 --> 03:31.200
Mr. Claverie will see you.

03:32.160 --> 03:33.480
Follow me.

03:41.560 --> 03:43.720
-Hello.
-Hello.

03:47.800 --> 03:49.360
Shall I sit?

03:49.960 --> 03:51.440
Please do.

03:51.680 --> 03:54.600
We're here to find you
an assignment.

03:55.520 --> 03:56.600
Really?

03:56.800 --> 04:00.280
Your exam results were excellent.
Congratulations.

04:00.920 --> 04:02.480
-Thank you.
-Congratulations.

04:02.680 --> 04:05.160
I'm in charge of security,
confidentiality,

04:05.360 --> 04:06.440
things of the sort.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.640
Which is very precious here.

04:09.120 --> 04:10.600
Found an apartment?

04:11.000 --> 04:13.760
Not yet.
I arrived by train this morning.

04:14.800 --> 04:17.200
You have an atypical trajectory.

04:17.760 --> 04:21.399
Excuse me,
you're no longer very young,

04:21.600 --> 04:24.760
and you haven't done
"traditional" studies.

04:25.320 --> 04:26.480
Meaning?

04:26.680 --> 04:29.240
Graduate studies
in politics or language...

04:30.760 --> 04:33.760
-I wasn't so lucky.
-But you speak six languages.

04:33.960 --> 04:37.800
Well, I understand Arabic a bit.
I wouldn't say I'm fluent.

04:38.680 --> 04:42.040
May I ask
where you learned these languages?

04:42.480 --> 04:45.400
I learned all alone in Roubaix.

04:46.440 --> 04:47.800
With manuals.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.800
Any scientific aptitudes?

04:50.440 --> 04:53.480
I love science, but I studied law.

04:53.880 --> 04:55.640
By correspondence!

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
It's an unusual path.

04:58.200 --> 05:01.200
It's uncommon
to begin working so late in life.

05:02.560 --> 05:05.160
I worked for my father for a while.

05:05.600 --> 05:09.000
I saw that in your file.
Dyeing factory.

05:09.240 --> 05:10.400
Traditional.

05:10.600 --> 05:14.600
That's where you got
your law degree, by correspondence.

05:15.040 --> 05:17.440
To pay off my father's bankruptcy.

05:17.640 --> 05:20.000
My mother died when I was a kid.

05:20.200 --> 05:22.800
And my father brought me up alone.

05:23.360 --> 05:25.440
-No military service?
-No.

05:25.960 --> 05:28.840
It says:
"Exempted for medical reasons."

05:29.040 --> 05:30.960
Were you ill?
-Yes.

05:31.400 --> 05:33.040
Is your health better?

05:33.360 --> 05:35.120
I received good treatment.

05:35.560 --> 05:38.960
Pardon my curiosity,
but what brings you here?

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
I read a government job ad
in the paper.

05:43.200 --> 05:45.480
But why Quai d'Orsay?

05:47.200 --> 05:48.760
Well...

05:48.960 --> 05:50.280
I thought...

05:50.480 --> 05:52.600
I was so curious about the world.

05:52.800 --> 05:54.080
Perfect.

05:55.200 --> 05:57.160
I hope we won't disappoint you.

05:57.840 --> 05:59.520
Welcome aboard.

06:04.320 --> 06:07.400
What would you have done
if you weren't admitted?

06:08.440 --> 06:09.720
Nothing.

06:11.000 --> 06:12.360
I was tired.

06:17.840 --> 06:20.960
"Nothing. I was tired."

06:46.080 --> 06:47.800
-Yes?
-It's me.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.080
Henri...

06:49.320 --> 06:51.640
-Am I bothering you?
-You can't bother me.

06:52.160 --> 06:53.360
What time is it?

06:53.560 --> 06:57.160
It's 3 o'clock
but I can't sleep at the moment.

06:58.280 --> 06:59.640
I'm losing my mind!

06:59.840 --> 07:02.000
-Don't panic.
-I need your help.

07:02.240 --> 07:04.080
-I'm coming.
-I'm fed up!

07:04.280 --> 07:07.640
I'll be there in twenty minutes!
Wait for me, Henri.

07:21.680 --> 07:23.640
-It's me.
-Come upstairs!

07:31.560 --> 07:34.120
I dreamt Carlotta was dead.

07:35.080 --> 07:36.440
My friend...

07:39.800 --> 07:41.640
Come.

07:45.440 --> 07:48.960
I was looking at these slides.

07:49.760 --> 07:51.600
And dark thoughts...

07:52.000 --> 07:53.920
...took a hold of me.

07:55.160 --> 07:58.240
Don't look at them at night.
It makes you melancholic.

07:58.520 --> 08:00.080
I miss my daughter.

08:06.320 --> 08:08.680
Every night
I dream about the ditch...

08:09.160 --> 08:11.560
...where my daughter
had her throat cut.

08:12.360 --> 08:15.960
It's a disgusting place
with dirty papers.

08:16.360 --> 08:17.840
And it's cold.

08:18.160 --> 08:19.440
Quiet.

08:19.720 --> 08:22.360
When Carlotta disappeared,
I hated you.

08:22.680 --> 08:24.080
I know.

08:24.280 --> 08:27.440
I wondered
what you could have done...

08:27.880 --> 08:30.680
...to make such a joyful girl
disappear like that.

08:31.160 --> 08:34.559
-What could I have done?
-I don't know.

08:34.760 --> 08:36.120
Cheat on her.

08:36.320 --> 08:38.159
Henri, you're one to talk!

08:38.360 --> 08:41.039
Who disappears
over an unfaithful husband?

08:41.919 --> 08:44.360
She's the one who slept around.

08:45.520 --> 08:46.600
Yes!

08:46.800 --> 08:48.640
She was strong like me.

08:49.080 --> 08:51.520
She loved life.
-Yes.

08:53.160 --> 08:55.040
She was running from you.

08:55.240 --> 08:57.440
She was running from all of us.

08:57.800 --> 08:59.360
Of course.

09:04.040 --> 09:06.800
And Carlotta
wasn't all that joyful.

09:07.160 --> 09:08.440
Wrong!

09:08.640 --> 09:12.760
She was the purest child ever!
She knew how to laugh!

09:13.040 --> 09:15.640
You're too consumed with despair.

09:18.120 --> 09:19.560
You're...

09:20.360 --> 09:22.040
...uncertain.

09:23.040 --> 09:25.160
No woman ever left me.

09:25.360 --> 09:27.240
But I was much too young,..

09:27.440 --> 09:30.880
...an awkward husband
obsessed by my films and theater.

09:31.080 --> 09:33.040
Selfish little son of a bitch.

09:34.280 --> 09:36.160
I couldn't look after her.

09:36.840 --> 09:38.800
I knew how to.

09:39.160 --> 09:42.000
You were a cumbersome father,
so cumbersome...

09:42.200 --> 09:46.000
...that she lived in your shadow,
then ended up in mine.

09:46.200 --> 09:48.120
Your shadow is nothing
next to mine!

09:48.320 --> 09:50.760
I realize that, dear master.

09:50.960 --> 09:53.600
A formidable father
and a husband too weak.

09:54.440 --> 09:56.280
Look at these pictures.

09:58.280 --> 09:59.560
Look.

10:00.720 --> 10:04.440
You declared her dead
and now I can't sleep.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.680
I declared her absent, not dead.

10:07.880 --> 10:11.680
You'd waited 18 years for her
and you found it unbearable.

10:13.200 --> 10:15.800
I'm going to the seaside.
Can I leave you?

10:16.000 --> 10:18.480
Still with your companion?

10:18.680 --> 10:20.320
-Sylvia.
-Yes.

10:20.680 --> 10:23.080
She's very good for you.

10:23.600 --> 10:25.720
You shouldn't have come to see me.

10:25.920 --> 10:27.880
Goodnight.
-Goodnight.

10:34.400 --> 10:35.520
Sir?

10:35.720 --> 10:37.480
May I borrow your phone?

10:37.680 --> 10:39.600
For Paris. I'll pay for the call.

10:39.800 --> 10:40.720
Sure.

10:42.200 --> 10:43.320
It's me.

10:44.080 --> 10:45.760
I just left Henri's.

10:46.120 --> 10:47.520
Am I waking you?

10:49.200 --> 10:50.680
He called
in the middle of the night.

10:51.960 --> 10:53.840
Can I come by your place?

11:00.440 --> 11:01.760
It's early.

11:03.240 --> 11:04.640
Come in.

11:11.840 --> 11:13.840
What did your tyrant want?

11:14.040 --> 11:16.400
He's an old man. He was crying.

11:16.960 --> 11:18.240
Why?

11:19.840 --> 11:21.880
He was thinking of his daughter.

11:25.160 --> 11:26.720
Do you think of her?

11:26.920 --> 11:30.360
It's been 20 years, dear.
Don't be jealous of a ghost.

11:31.520 --> 11:33.080
You'll try to sleep?

11:33.360 --> 11:35.400
I don't know. I'll lie down.

11:36.520 --> 11:38.040
Get undressed!

11:38.440 --> 11:40.040
Come in bed with me!

11:42.560 --> 11:44.480
You need to sleep.

11:51.720 --> 11:55.480
Two years ago, I met Ismael
through some mutual friends.

12:07.520 --> 12:09.280
I'm an astrophysicist.

12:09.920 --> 12:12.200
Ismael was a filmmaker.

12:15.360 --> 12:18.600
He was a loner,
loved to be aggressive.

12:18.960 --> 12:22.320
Rumor had it
he'd lost a wife, very young.

12:23.720 --> 12:26.560
I enjoyed bumping into him,
even if he scared me.

12:27.920 --> 12:30.720
I stared at him,
from the end of the table.

12:31.480 --> 12:33.120
He looked thuggish.

12:33.760 --> 12:36.280
He loved making fun
of the books I read.

12:36.760 --> 12:38.640
And of my prudishness.

12:39.640 --> 12:41.520
I was slowly getting drunk.

12:42.080 --> 12:43.280
Then I started leaving.

12:43.480 --> 12:45.560
Leaving because
I made you uncomfortable?

12:45.840 --> 12:47.320
No, not at all.

12:48.520 --> 12:51.440
-Can I drop you off by taxi?
-I don't know.

12:51.640 --> 12:55.360
One night, he offered me a ride.

13:05.920 --> 13:07.520
How about a drink?

13:08.200 --> 13:10.080
No ulterior motives.

13:12.200 --> 13:13.520
Yes.

13:17.760 --> 13:19.480
Do you know a bar?

13:20.400 --> 13:21.840
Yes.

13:29.280 --> 13:31.360
Why don't you have kids?

13:31.920 --> 13:33.320
Married men.

13:33.520 --> 13:34.520
What?

13:34.720 --> 13:36.640
I loved married men.

13:37.280 --> 13:38.440
Your specialty.

13:39.320 --> 13:40.520
Yes, that's it.

13:41.560 --> 13:42.760
Good.

13:42.960 --> 13:47.240
I'm single now,
so we don't stand much of a chance.

13:47.640 --> 13:49.120
None whatsoever.

13:50.720 --> 13:52.160
And you, no kids?

13:52.360 --> 13:54.640
I adopted one, once.

13:55.120 --> 13:56.200
I did.

13:56.400 --> 13:57.560
Not bad.

13:57.760 --> 13:59.560
It didn't end well.

14:00.040 --> 14:02.160
-That's sad.
-No, it's okay.

14:02.480 --> 14:06.120
Why didn't you have children
with your married man?

14:06.320 --> 14:08.040
You mean at my age?

14:08.640 --> 14:11.800
-I never ask ladies their ages.
-Ladies?

14:12.440 --> 14:13.680
Yes.

14:21.480 --> 14:23.760
I'm my brother's legal guardian.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.240
Is he crazy?

14:26.520 --> 14:27.320
No.

14:27.560 --> 14:31.440
-Is he in jail? An alcoholic?
-Nope.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.720
He's handicapped.

14:35.200 --> 14:37.640
It forbids you from having a child.

14:38.080 --> 14:39.560
Yes, a little.

14:39.920 --> 14:42.520
It's been my whole life.
-Your brother?

14:42.720 --> 14:46.480
-Well, not my whole life.
-There's the married man too.

14:47.120 --> 14:48.640
What's his name?

14:48.840 --> 14:50.480
The handicapped brother?

14:50.960 --> 14:52.320
Pierre.

14:53.240 --> 14:54.640
It frightens you.

14:54.840 --> 14:56.200
No.

14:57.480 --> 14:59.520
He's my blessing.

15:00.320 --> 15:04.000
-In fact, you're not really single.
-Really?

15:04.280 --> 15:08.120
I've seen you
with a very young woman.

15:08.320 --> 15:10.160
It's over with her.

15:10.600 --> 15:12.240
You were together for a while.

15:12.440 --> 15:14.760
There were a lot of breaks.

15:14.960 --> 15:18.800
We wanted to leave each other,
but never at the same time.

15:19.640 --> 15:21.800
And yet, it was practical.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.360
I had someone at home
to answer the phone.

15:24.560 --> 15:26.200
How convenient!

15:27.840 --> 15:30.560
-Want a bite?
-No, thanks.

15:31.320 --> 15:33.480
So you're between women?

15:33.680 --> 15:34.880
That's right.

15:35.720 --> 15:37.720
And you sleep with your actresses?

15:38.000 --> 15:39.280
Of course.

15:39.480 --> 15:41.720
-They're very pretty!
-Very.

15:41.960 --> 15:43.280
It's here.

15:43.840 --> 15:45.800
I'd like to come up.

15:46.240 --> 15:48.960
-No, it's too late.
-Just for five minutes.

15:49.600 --> 15:50.760
I said no.

15:50.960 --> 15:53.520
I'll go upstairs,
then leave right away.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.160
So why go up?

15:55.360 --> 15:57.920
I just want to see where you live!

15:58.120 --> 15:59.160
I said no!

15:59.360 --> 16:01.880
Do I have to beg to see it,
on my knees?

16:02.080 --> 16:03.720
It'll just embarrass you!

16:03.920 --> 16:05.560
Stop it! Stop!

16:05.760 --> 16:07.760
You're so damn stiff!

16:07.960 --> 16:09.560
I'm not stiff.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.120
I'm shy.

16:14.840 --> 16:16.480
This isn't right.

16:42.520 --> 16:44.080
Okay, it's pretty.

16:44.400 --> 16:45.680
Goodbye.

16:46.120 --> 16:47.720
You're not kissing me?

16:47.920 --> 16:49.360
No.

16:53.080 --> 16:55.280
Your friends told you
I'm a widower?

16:56.120 --> 16:57.200
Yes.

16:57.560 --> 16:59.080
I'm sorry.

17:02.120 --> 17:03.520
My dear!

17:12.480 --> 17:14.440
I never dared ask...

17:15.200 --> 17:17.280
What is your movie about?

17:19.480 --> 17:21.640
It's a portrait of my brother.

17:22.040 --> 17:24.000
-Ivan?
-Yes, Ivan.

17:25.240 --> 17:27.480
Why have I never met your brother?

17:27.680 --> 17:30.880
He's at the other end of the world.
I'm a homebody.

17:31.360 --> 17:33.560
He was the sensible brother.

17:33.760 --> 17:35.360
I was the madman.

17:35.640 --> 17:37.920
-So you admit it?
-You bet!

17:39.040 --> 17:40.960
He was the spy?

17:41.400 --> 17:43.360
I believe so.

17:44.360 --> 17:46.520
So you'll get your movie done.

17:49.080 --> 17:50.880
How do you know?

17:51.440 --> 17:53.640
I trust you blindly.

17:54.040 --> 17:55.880
You don't know me.

17:56.360 --> 17:57.800
I think I do.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.640
Better than anyone.

18:00.800 --> 18:02.640
You didn't write today?

18:04.520 --> 18:06.960
Don't scold me.

18:07.440 --> 18:10.600
You sleep all day
and can't sleep at night.

18:10.800 --> 18:12.600
I'm terrified.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.760
I don't want you to be afraid,
my love.

18:15.960 --> 18:18.440
It's the nightmares,
every single night.

18:18.640 --> 18:20.840
I re-read
"The Interpretation of Dreams".

18:22.800 --> 18:25.320
There's no explanation
for nightmares.

18:25.520 --> 18:28.720
None whatsoever.
It's pure persecution!

18:28.920 --> 18:31.680
Go easy on the pills.
You won't wake up.

18:31.880 --> 18:35.480
I have to knock myself out
or the nightmares persecute me.

18:35.680 --> 18:37.800
Stop with that.
You'll kill yourself.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.520
It's my nightmares
that will kill me.

18:43.680 --> 18:45.040
My friend...

18:45.440 --> 18:46.840
...come here.

18:47.360 --> 18:48.760
Come here!

19:32.160 --> 19:34.360
When we talked about Ivan...

19:34.880 --> 19:37.960
...we tried to sketch
a profile of him.

19:41.800 --> 19:44.760
When we talked about Ivan,
we tried to sketch a profile.

19:44.960 --> 19:47.640
But it was hopeless from the start.

19:47.960 --> 19:50.120
Him and his legendary naps!

19:50.480 --> 19:53.320
Once I went to a conference
with Ivan.

19:54.040 --> 19:55.640
Something European.

19:55.840 --> 19:59.680
On the way back,
we missed our connection in Bern.

19:59.880 --> 20:02.240
Our delegation
waited at the airport...

20:02.440 --> 20:03.800
...for the next flight.

20:04.160 --> 20:08.200
Three sleepless nights in Stockholm
and five more hours in Switzerland.

20:08.400 --> 20:10.480
We all slept like babies.

20:35.960 --> 20:37.440
You're not sleeping?

20:38.120 --> 20:39.800
No, I can't.

20:40.400 --> 20:43.080
Count all the diplomats you've met.

20:44.120 --> 20:47.160
I suffer
from a degenerative disease.

20:48.280 --> 20:50.160
The Elsinore Syndrome.

20:50.360 --> 20:52.680
-Like the castle in "Hamlet"?
-Yes.

20:53.400 --> 20:56.960
-I have violent nightmares.
-What kind of nightmares?

20:58.480 --> 21:01.600
-I'm embarrassed.
-Sorry, I'm indiscreet!

21:01.800 --> 21:04.120
It's fine. I sleep at the office.

21:04.400 --> 21:07.320
How do you stop yourself
from sleeping?

21:08.720 --> 21:10.400
I have pills.

22:02.160 --> 22:03.560
Are you Sylvia?

22:04.200 --> 22:06.560
Ismael's companion?
-Yes.

22:08.680 --> 22:10.040
Where is he?

22:13.640 --> 22:15.640
In his room, writing.

22:18.880 --> 22:20.880
He still doesn't like swimming?

22:23.840 --> 22:25.760
How do you know that?

22:26.840 --> 22:28.600
Because I'm his wife.

22:30.880 --> 22:32.440
Carlotta.

22:41.560 --> 22:43.560
I thought you were dead.

22:46.000 --> 22:49.000
I've seen you before.
In a painting.

22:49.640 --> 22:51.200
How so?

22:53.000 --> 22:55.720
Ismael has a painting of you
at his place.

22:56.840 --> 22:58.360
Oh, that.

22:59.360 --> 23:01.920
It's an old portrait. I was 16.

23:08.800 --> 23:10.240
I'll tell him.

23:47.240 --> 23:49.600
-Get any work done?
-Not enough.

23:51.640 --> 23:53.200
What's wrong?

23:56.520 --> 23:58.640
I think I saw Carlotta.

23:59.120 --> 24:00.840
On the beach.

24:02.360 --> 24:04.800
I'm afraid it'll drive you crazy.

24:06.240 --> 24:07.760
Or I'll go crazy.

24:08.280 --> 24:12.000
Don't mention Carlotta.
I don't want to hear about her.

24:15.880 --> 24:17.480
She's alive.

24:19.080 --> 24:20.800
What are you saying?

24:22.240 --> 24:25.240
She was there. On the beach.

24:28.720 --> 24:30.800
You're insane, dear.

24:31.240 --> 24:34.640
She came back with me.
She's waiting downstairs.

24:35.560 --> 24:37.600
How do you know it's her?

24:38.960 --> 24:41.080
Because she told me.

25:12.200 --> 25:13.840
It's me.

25:16.320 --> 25:17.880
Yes.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.920
I've changed my hair.

25:25.800 --> 25:27.520
Like it?

25:28.360 --> 25:30.000
Yes.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.880
You've aged.

25:36.600 --> 25:38.720
How long has it been?

25:40.160 --> 25:42.920
21 years, 8 months and 6 days.

25:48.560 --> 25:50.280
Am I bothering you?

25:50.720 --> 25:54.120
No. I was writing.

25:55.160 --> 25:57.240
You still make films?

25:57.840 --> 25:59.080
Yes.

26:01.160 --> 26:02.800
I haven't seen them.

26:03.520 --> 26:06.040
I tried through Ivan,
but he disappeared.

26:06.240 --> 26:07.880
No longer in France?

26:09.720 --> 26:11.640
I liked him.

26:22.920 --> 26:25.840
Sorry but
I don't know anyone anymore.

26:26.760 --> 26:29.240
I have nowhere to stay.

26:47.880 --> 26:49.840
You left France?

26:50.280 --> 26:51.600
Yes.

26:53.720 --> 26:55.360
And now?

26:55.960 --> 26:57.560
I'm in Paris.

26:58.040 --> 26:59.920
In a shelter.

27:00.120 --> 27:02.840
You have a place to sleep tonight?

27:05.320 --> 27:06.800
No.

27:07.280 --> 27:09.520
So you can stay here.

27:12.240 --> 27:13.840
All right.

27:22.720 --> 27:25.640
It's too big for us.
We never use it.

27:28.760 --> 27:31.440
I put a towel in the bathroom.

27:35.440 --> 27:37.360
Because I smell bad?

27:37.800 --> 27:39.600
Yes, a little.

27:41.080 --> 27:43.040
Want to borrow some clothes?

27:43.720 --> 27:45.160
I'll be fine.

27:46.800 --> 27:49.400
Why not ask for news
of your father?

27:49.880 --> 27:51.400
Oh, him...

27:52.840 --> 27:55.320
-Do you know him?
-No.

27:56.320 --> 27:58.520
If he were dead, I'd have heard.

30:30.440 --> 30:32.640
It was all a lie.

30:32.920 --> 30:34.720
What was a lie?

30:34.960 --> 30:36.360
You and me!

30:36.560 --> 30:39.640
Quiet. Fight! Fight now!

30:39.920 --> 30:42.800
I don't have the strength!
I wish she were dead!

30:43.000 --> 30:44.840
No.

30:45.040 --> 30:47.240
I wanted her never to come back!

30:47.440 --> 30:48.880
Me too.

30:49.920 --> 30:51.400
No!

30:52.120 --> 30:53.360
It's her!

30:54.240 --> 30:55.280
Go on.

30:55.840 --> 30:58.080
Sleep with her and I'll kill you.

31:00.080 --> 31:01.280
No.

31:01.480 --> 31:02.840
Carlotta...

31:03.520 --> 31:04.960
Wake up.

31:11.600 --> 31:14.240
-It was an awful nightmare.
-And me?

31:14.440 --> 31:15.800
How about me?

31:16.000 --> 31:19.640
I'm in a living nightmare
and I can't wake up!

31:19.960 --> 31:21.760
Please don't shout.

31:23.840 --> 31:25.880
I'm an old woman now.

31:26.520 --> 31:28.480
I'm coming back to you.

31:29.720 --> 31:31.200
One day I'll die.

31:31.400 --> 31:34.560
You won't die, you're already dead!
Filthy w..re!

31:34.760 --> 31:36.760
What were you doing for 20 years?

31:36.960 --> 31:39.000
Twenty-one f..ing years!

31:39.200 --> 31:41.200
Answer, you piece of s..t!

31:41.400 --> 31:42.960
-I can't remember.
-No, wrong!

31:43.160 --> 31:44.680
It's me who doesn't know!

31:44.880 --> 31:48.120
Me! A thousand times
I thought you dead!

31:48.320 --> 31:50.920
I was your widower
without a corpse to mourn!

31:51.120 --> 31:54.360
You know what you did
with 21 years of my life. Tell me.

31:54.560 --> 31:57.200
Where did you go? Where were you?

31:57.960 --> 31:59.480
Why?

31:59.680 --> 32:01.720
When? When?

32:02.120 --> 32:04.080
With who?

32:05.280 --> 32:06.680
I left alone.

32:07.000 --> 32:08.840
What do you mean, alone?

32:10.080 --> 32:11.440
Yes.

32:12.280 --> 32:14.440
I can't remember why.

32:15.320 --> 32:17.320
I was going crazy.

32:17.840 --> 32:19.840
I was twenty.

32:22.040 --> 32:24.280
One day I was out walking.

32:24.600 --> 32:26.280
I went into a station.

32:26.640 --> 32:28.400
I took a train.

32:29.560 --> 32:32.200
Not knowing how long
I was leaving for.

32:32.640 --> 32:34.200
A week?

32:34.520 --> 32:35.640
A year?

32:35.840 --> 32:37.320
I don't know.

32:37.640 --> 32:39.640
I couldn't breathe anymore.

32:39.840 --> 32:42.680
I got off in Lyon.

32:43.200 --> 32:45.080
It's a big city.

32:45.480 --> 32:47.520
I didn't know it.

32:48.920 --> 32:50.920
I said to myself...

32:51.480 --> 32:53.720
...it was easy to disappear there.

32:54.160 --> 32:56.800
That no one would come looking.

33:02.480 --> 33:04.880
At first I wandered the streets.

33:06.200 --> 33:08.440
Then the halfway houses.

33:08.640 --> 33:11.120
-You did drugs?
-Yes.

33:14.160 --> 33:16.600
-Were you in prison?
-No.

33:18.240 --> 33:20.360
Then I worked.

33:21.560 --> 33:24.040
I lived with people
in the countryside.

33:24.960 --> 33:26.680
It lasted...

33:27.320 --> 33:29.720
...six years I think.
-Six years!

33:30.120 --> 33:33.640
Why not send a note
to say you weren't dead, dammit?

33:33.840 --> 33:35.840
I didn't need an address.
I'm no cop.

33:36.040 --> 33:38.400
I wanted you alive, that's all.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.520
But I was like dead.

33:41.720 --> 33:45.440
Dead? Bulls..t! 21 years!
You were dead!

33:45.640 --> 33:49.480
I did every precinct,
every hospital, every morgue.

33:49.680 --> 33:52.360
F..ing detectives
your father and I paid for!

33:52.760 --> 33:56.880
On every trip I searched
for your face at every station...

33:57.080 --> 33:59.160
...with the three pictures
I had of you.

33:59.360 --> 34:02.640
What did I do to you?
-I didn't know how to live.

34:03.720 --> 34:05.320
It was unbearable.

34:05.640 --> 34:08.239
I wanted to vanish,
to tear up my life.

34:08.520 --> 34:11.000
No! No!

34:12.920 --> 34:15.199
It's my life you tore up!

34:15.400 --> 34:16.760
And your father's!

34:17.120 --> 34:20.840
You used to say we owed nothing
to anyone but ourselves.

34:21.040 --> 34:22.639
That's crap.

34:22.840 --> 34:24.239
You know what happened?

34:24.440 --> 34:27.080
After 10 years,
you get declared dead.

34:27.280 --> 34:29.639
It's me who signed
the piece of paper.

34:29.840 --> 34:32.560
A paper which I brought
to your father.

34:32.880 --> 34:34.800
We had no tomb to cry at.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.520
Just that paper with your name:
"Absent".

34:37.800 --> 34:39.520
And that brought no relief.

34:39.719 --> 34:42.639
Just 21 years of grief!

34:45.040 --> 34:47.360
And were you happy?

34:48.920 --> 34:51.040
I abandoned you, honey.

34:51.679 --> 34:53.280
What about your father?

34:56.960 --> 34:58.880
I abandoned all of you.

34:59.400 --> 35:01.360
You weighed too heavy.

35:02.240 --> 35:05.360
Or I was too heavy.
-And now you're light?

35:06.320 --> 35:07.760
Yes.

35:10.720 --> 35:14.880
Over the years, one day,
I was in India and I became light.

35:15.080 --> 35:18.800
India? I don't care.
Yes, you were heavy.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.080
You weighed a ton in Paris.

35:21.280 --> 35:23.600
You were my ball and chain.

35:24.240 --> 35:26.080
Were there men?

35:26.680 --> 35:28.640
-Of course.
-How many?

35:29.400 --> 35:30.680
A lot.

35:31.320 --> 35:34.200
-What did you tell them?
-Nothing.

35:35.040 --> 35:37.760
The contract was no questions,
just the present.

35:37.960 --> 35:39.680
The present is s..t.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.000
I let myself drift.

35:42.360 --> 35:43.480
Everywhere.

35:44.400 --> 35:46.960
And then I met a man in New Delhi.

35:47.480 --> 35:49.080
He married me.

35:50.720 --> 35:52.440
And then he died.

35:53.600 --> 35:55.360
But...

35:56.240 --> 35:57.520
...when?

35:58.640 --> 36:00.560
Three weeks ago.

36:02.640 --> 36:05.000
So I thought I should come home.

36:06.640 --> 36:08.840
I didn't know where to go.

36:09.960 --> 36:11.920
I had nothing to run from.

36:51.720 --> 36:53.960
One day,
a rabbi friend of Bloom's...

36:54.160 --> 36:57.800
...offered to do a funeral service.
To dig a grave.

36:59.200 --> 37:00.800
Bloom refused.

37:01.120 --> 37:04.200
What kind of grave is it
without a body?

37:05.400 --> 37:07.720
So in the end,
Bloom and I never buried her.

37:08.080 --> 37:10.160
See? We were right.

37:18.280 --> 37:20.320
I remember it's this way.

37:29.480 --> 37:31.600
There's never anyone.

37:59.920 --> 38:01.720
Good book?

38:03.240 --> 38:04.880
Yes.

38:07.680 --> 38:10.320
I never read. I never did.

38:11.240 --> 38:13.560
To my father's despair.

38:14.240 --> 38:17.720
When my mother died,
I was very young...

38:19.280 --> 38:20.760
...and...

38:21.160 --> 38:24.200
...I was at boarding school
and came home on weekends.

38:24.920 --> 38:26.560
At night...

38:26.760 --> 38:29.520
...my father recited poetry to me
at bedtime.

38:30.360 --> 38:35.040
And I remember a German poem
which he kept translating...

38:36.240 --> 38:37.880
..."One day...

38:38.640 --> 38:40.560
...when I lose you...

38:42.000 --> 38:44.400
...how will you be able
to fall asleep?

38:45.040 --> 38:47.920
Without me rustling over you...

38:48.680 --> 38:51.200
...like a linden crown."

38:52.480 --> 38:54.120
Bloom.

38:54.760 --> 38:57.120
He had his affectations.

38:58.800 --> 39:00.240
What's your religion?

39:00.760 --> 39:02.280
I don't have any.

39:02.680 --> 39:05.440
-That's what you answered Ismael?
-What?

39:05.680 --> 39:08.960
Don't tell me
he never asked your religion.

39:09.960 --> 39:11.640
He did.

39:12.600 --> 39:15.640
I'm Protestant.
-How vicious of him!

39:15.840 --> 39:18.320
That's why he went out with you.

39:18.920 --> 39:22.520
A Protestant. He couldn't resist.
-Maybe.

39:23.400 --> 39:25.000
How about you?

39:25.480 --> 39:27.840
I'm a renegade Jew.

39:28.080 --> 39:30.120
To my father's despair.

40:02.200 --> 40:05.080
-Who are you?
-I'm sorry. I'm Ivan Dedalus.

40:05.280 --> 40:07.480
-We're colleagues.
-Step back.

40:08.200 --> 40:11.800
You think... But no.
I'm a clerk in European Affairs.

40:12.000 --> 40:15.120
It's been six months.
We met once in an airport.

40:16.440 --> 40:18.160
I remember.

40:18.680 --> 40:19.840
What do you want?

40:20.040 --> 40:23.040
I've thought about you
and I wondered...

40:23.360 --> 40:24.800
...if maybe...

40:25.320 --> 40:29.800
...you'd agree to go out with me...

40:30.000 --> 40:32.840
...one night, or on a Sunday.
-With you?

40:33.920 --> 40:35.240
Yeah.

40:35.960 --> 40:39.080
You're not a little crazy?

40:40.160 --> 40:42.440
Yes, I act like
a deranged person...

40:42.640 --> 40:45.280
...but at work I'm not crazy.
You scare me.

40:45.480 --> 40:48.320
It's you who scares me.
You followed me here.

40:48.520 --> 40:49.680
I'm really sorry.

40:49.880 --> 40:52.920
But you'd make me so happy
if you'd agree to...

40:53.200 --> 40:56.640
...if you had a free evening.
-Well, maybe.

40:58.320 --> 41:00.640
Meaning it's possible? When?

41:00.840 --> 41:02.480
Why not now?

41:03.320 --> 41:07.200
I found them. Here they are.

41:08.080 --> 41:10.480
You see? Real leather!

41:10.680 --> 41:13.280
So they're sending you abroad?

41:13.600 --> 41:17.200
For now I'm just filing reports,
doing photocopies.

41:18.480 --> 41:20.840
They're too big.
-Sit down.

41:21.560 --> 41:23.240
We'll fix that.

41:25.040 --> 41:26.560
Now try it on.

41:29.160 --> 41:30.640
Perfect!

41:31.800 --> 41:33.680
You're handsome like that.

41:34.280 --> 41:36.960
You always had trouble
finding women.

41:37.960 --> 41:39.400
Yes.

41:39.920 --> 41:41.320
Why?

41:42.240 --> 41:43.520
I don't know.

41:43.720 --> 41:46.600
Shyness.
-My poor old bachelor.

41:47.400 --> 41:50.960
Dad, I think I met a woman.

41:51.880 --> 41:53.000
Ivan!

41:53.200 --> 41:57.280
-Come and see the lunar eclipse!
-Here, for you.

41:58.280 --> 41:59.280
What is it?

41:59.480 --> 42:01.960
You were named attaché
at the embassy in Dushanbe.

42:02.920 --> 42:06.240
You're leaving in two weeks.
For three years.

42:08.760 --> 42:10.160
Three years?

42:10.360 --> 42:13.200
-You just have to marry me.
-Arielle...

42:14.720 --> 42:18.040
You don't know who I am.
-So what? I'll learn!

42:20.000 --> 42:22.320
Arielle had stayed an adolescent.

42:22.520 --> 42:25.600
She wanted a hero,
an Achilles or a Patroclus...

42:25.920 --> 42:27.960
...or someone
killed at Thermopylae.

42:28.200 --> 42:29.760
She chose Ivan.

42:29.960 --> 42:31.520
Oh s..t!

42:34.800 --> 42:37.960
On hearing of the marriage,
a friend of Arielle's said...

42:38.160 --> 42:39.480
..."It's suicide."

42:39.680 --> 42:41.880
Word of that got back to Ivan.

42:43.320 --> 42:48.320
It's not easy
being someone's suicide.

42:51.560 --> 42:54.400
-You're not that different.
-What?

42:55.600 --> 42:57.680
Aren't we alike?

43:00.520 --> 43:02.320
You and I are the same.

43:04.640 --> 43:06.000
Yes.

44:49.400 --> 44:51.400
What did you come here for?

44:53.680 --> 44:56.280
-I think you know.
-No.

44:57.160 --> 45:00.000
When I recovered Ismael,
he was an old man.

45:00.680 --> 45:04.200
I wrenched him from you.
Now he has a real life.

45:05.160 --> 45:07.080
Why are you shrugging?

45:08.680 --> 45:11.480
-Ismael is playing a role.
-No.

45:12.320 --> 45:15.120
-He's my child.
-You're wrong.

45:15.520 --> 45:17.200
You don't know him anymore.

45:17.760 --> 45:20.040
You came to destroy me?
-No.

45:21.000 --> 45:23.080
I always thought about him.

45:23.480 --> 45:25.120
He's in my thoughts.

45:25.400 --> 45:29.280
Why are you here today?
Why not two years ago?

45:29.720 --> 45:32.680
I wasn't free before.
I was married.

45:34.480 --> 45:37.440
-Where's your husband?
-My husband died.

45:37.640 --> 45:39.960
-You're crazy!
-And I'm here.

45:40.200 --> 45:44.520
-Everything you say is poison.
-I've come to take my man back.

45:44.760 --> 45:46.120
You're ugly.

45:46.320 --> 45:48.200
Everything you say is ugly.

45:48.720 --> 45:50.760
You can live without him.

45:51.240 --> 45:53.160
You won't be unhappy.

45:54.280 --> 45:56.120
I can't.

45:57.720 --> 45:59.480
Without Ismael...

46:00.000 --> 46:01.960
You should have loved your husband.

46:03.080 --> 46:04.800
That was impossible.

46:05.960 --> 46:07.520
You no longer exist.

46:07.720 --> 46:09.880
Even for your father,
you don't exist.

46:10.200 --> 46:12.600
You were declared dead, Carlotta.

46:12.800 --> 46:15.600
You exist for no one now.

46:23.160 --> 46:26.320
Alexander and I had been together
for six years.

46:27.600 --> 46:30.280
I'd come to New Delhi
with fake papers.

46:30.640 --> 46:32.560
I called myself Esther.

46:32.960 --> 46:34.520
I was very poor.

46:35.160 --> 46:37.320
I can't remember how I got by.

46:39.760 --> 46:42.080
When I met Alex, he was married.

46:43.200 --> 46:47.280
He was older than me.
Very handsome. I liked that.

46:48.880 --> 46:52.520
He left his wife.
His kids were already grown.

46:54.200 --> 46:56.960
He bought a sort of palace
in the countryside.

46:57.560 --> 46:59.320
I moved in with him.

46:59.840 --> 47:02.440
He listened to Indian music
all the time.

47:03.440 --> 47:06.800
Musicians would come by the house.
It was joyful.

47:07.520 --> 47:09.280
One day he died.

47:10.480 --> 47:13.520
He vomited blood. He vomited on me.

47:13.960 --> 47:16.160
At the Anglican church,
for his funeral...

47:16.360 --> 47:18.160
...there was his family.

47:19.480 --> 47:21.400
I was alone.

47:23.080 --> 47:25.440
His son came and told me to leave.

47:26.200 --> 47:27.880
I didn't leave.

47:28.280 --> 47:30.160
I stayed.

47:33.560 --> 47:35.720
And he called me a whore.

47:37.000 --> 47:39.520
Like in a nightmare.

47:42.920 --> 47:44.800
And when I got back home...

47:45.760 --> 47:47.800
...there were lawyers.

47:48.360 --> 47:50.560
All the furniture had been seized.

47:51.800 --> 47:54.040
They even took my clothes.

47:54.400 --> 47:56.400
I had nothing.

48:18.280 --> 48:20.120
Who was she?

48:20.640 --> 48:22.760
I told you a thousand times.

48:23.120 --> 48:24.640
Did you love her?

48:24.840 --> 48:26.680
I told you a thousand times.

48:27.040 --> 48:29.040
How did you love her?

48:30.920 --> 48:33.720
The way you love a vulnerable girl.

48:34.080 --> 48:35.840
She wavered.

48:36.040 --> 48:38.400
Everything hurt her.
I was her shield.

48:38.600 --> 48:41.560
I never stopped
not being enough for her.

48:42.880 --> 48:46.160
And I wasn't vulnerable
when you met me?

48:46.680 --> 48:48.320
Yes.

48:48.920 --> 48:50.760
In a different way.

48:52.040 --> 48:53.640
How?

48:53.960 --> 48:56.720
You were alone, very alone.

48:57.560 --> 48:59.160
A nun.

49:00.440 --> 49:03.000
You think I'm a nun in bed?

49:03.760 --> 49:05.400
Oh, no.

49:09.840 --> 49:12.680
-How was Carlotta in bed?
-I can't remember.

49:12.880 --> 49:15.840
Bad answer. You never forget that.

49:18.520 --> 49:20.880
She was distraught.

49:21.480 --> 49:23.000
How so?

49:23.320 --> 49:26.440
She'd often cry
when she was making love.

49:28.200 --> 49:30.080
What about me, now?

49:31.720 --> 49:33.720
You're crying.

49:40.880 --> 49:42.600
Did she cheat on you?

49:42.880 --> 49:44.080
Yes.

49:44.480 --> 49:45.640
All the time.

49:45.840 --> 49:49.640
With whoever came along.
She needed men to hold onto.

49:49.840 --> 49:51.760
I was one of them.

49:53.920 --> 49:55.400
I don't know...

49:55.960 --> 49:59.360
I don't know how to cheat on you.
I don't know how.

50:01.240 --> 50:04.480
I owe nothing to Carlotta.
I owe you everything.

50:04.800 --> 50:07.560
I don't want debts
between me and a man.

50:09.760 --> 50:12.080
Yes, I did save your life.

50:12.960 --> 50:15.520
I'm jealous of Carlotta.

50:16.280 --> 50:18.640
I can't help this jealousy.

50:19.800 --> 50:22.040
It's burning me up!

50:26.400 --> 50:29.720
I won't go back with Carlotta.

50:32.760 --> 50:34.800
I wanted to drive you crazy.

50:35.000 --> 50:37.240
Not make you reasonable.

50:39.520 --> 50:42.080
That's why I'm jealous.

50:43.160 --> 50:45.400
I met you too late.

51:30.080 --> 51:31.840
Going to sleep?

51:34.320 --> 51:36.200
What are you doing?

51:37.480 --> 51:39.880
I wanted to look at you once more.

51:41.080 --> 51:42.840
Why?

51:46.040 --> 51:47.600
Talk to me!

51:48.080 --> 51:49.600
Quiet!

51:49.920 --> 51:52.280
Quiet.
-Talk to me.

51:55.120 --> 51:56.880
I'm leaving.

51:59.520 --> 52:02.120
I don't know
if I want to see you again.

52:05.560 --> 52:07.240
I don't know
how to love myself enough...

52:07.440 --> 52:09.240
...to ask you to come.

52:11.240 --> 52:15.480
-Let me leave. I beg you.
-Stay. It's me who beg you.

53:30.320 --> 53:33.040
-Wine in the morning?
-I got no sleep.

53:34.480 --> 53:37.520
I'm writing some words of praise
on your father.

53:40.520 --> 53:44.520
-Sylvia is at the sea?
-No. She's gone.

53:46.560 --> 53:49.520
-Where?
-Far from here.

53:54.160 --> 53:56.360
Why didn't you leave too?

53:57.880 --> 53:59.840
She didn't want me to.

54:02.360 --> 54:03.880
Is it because of me?

54:04.480 --> 54:07.760
She's an astrophysicist,
head in the stars,..

54:07.960 --> 54:09.480
...believes in infinity.

54:09.920 --> 54:12.200
You picked an intelligent woman.

54:13.360 --> 54:15.760
Sylvia is beautiful
and intelligent.

54:16.160 --> 54:17.560
Yes.

54:18.440 --> 54:21.560
I wasn't intelligent.
-Oh yes, you were.

54:22.200 --> 54:24.000
But so sad.

54:24.760 --> 54:26.960
I've changed, my friend.

54:43.160 --> 54:45.280
I can't anymore, Carlotta.

54:46.040 --> 54:48.920
I won't live with you,
never again.

54:50.520 --> 54:52.440
By tomorrow, I'll have vanished.

54:53.320 --> 54:54.720
Like that.

55:35.200 --> 55:36.440
My heart...

55:36.880 --> 55:38.600
You...

55:58.600 --> 56:00.320
What are you doing?

56:01.200 --> 56:02.640
Snooping around.

56:03.160 --> 56:04.720
Why?

56:10.120 --> 56:12.040
You have a child!

56:12.480 --> 56:14.040
Who?

56:15.880 --> 56:18.840
-You and Sylvia have a child.
-No.

56:20.240 --> 56:22.000
Whose picture is this?

56:22.760 --> 56:24.840
A kid I knew.

56:29.760 --> 56:32.440
-Give me a child.
-What?

56:34.480 --> 56:37.400
-I want to have your child.
-Go away.

56:39.280 --> 56:41.600
One day you'll disappear again.

56:43.200 --> 56:45.520
Please. I want it.

56:46.160 --> 56:48.200
You should have with your Indian.

56:49.640 --> 56:51.480
That was different.

56:53.400 --> 56:55.400
I really loved you.

56:56.960 --> 57:00.040
You won't have to raise it.
-I'm too old.

57:00.440 --> 57:03.320
-You're not old.
-Yes, I am.

57:03.720 --> 57:05.920
And I don't want to be survived.

57:17.360 --> 57:19.960
Why didn't you go see your father?

57:21.280 --> 57:23.160
I won't see him again.

57:23.840 --> 57:25.440
It's too late.

57:26.520 --> 57:27.960
What?

57:29.000 --> 57:32.760
I have to accept what I've done
and can no longer undo.

57:33.160 --> 57:35.760
How do I know you're Carlotta?

57:36.080 --> 57:39.520
Not some madwoman
pretending to be her?

57:39.720 --> 57:41.320
What was your mother's name?

57:41.520 --> 57:44.280
When did she die?
Tell me where she's buried!

57:44.480 --> 57:46.520
Tell me the name
of the violin teacher...

57:46.720 --> 57:49.600
...I made you see
when you wanted to give up?

57:49.800 --> 57:52.040
Why are you pretending?

57:52.240 --> 57:55.400
If I answer,
you'll suffer even more.

57:56.120 --> 57:58.360
-No.
-How much suffering do you want?

57:58.560 --> 58:02.200
You won't see Henri
because you're afraid, terrified!

58:02.480 --> 58:06.080
Go see your father
and let him die in peace!

58:06.280 --> 58:09.760
I won't lie to him! You're here
and I'm afraid to call him!

58:09.960 --> 58:12.520
It's tearing my mouth out!
You're a lie!

58:12.920 --> 58:15.160
Everything about you is a lie!

58:15.600 --> 58:18.440
He's my father, not yours.

58:20.280 --> 58:21.800
Marry him.

58:22.320 --> 58:23.880
Or leave me alone.

58:24.080 --> 58:26.280
It was him I loved through you!

58:29.880 --> 58:33.120
-Going to Sylvia?
-None of your business!

58:33.920 --> 58:35.960
-Don't be violent.
-Let me alone!

58:36.560 --> 58:38.080
You crush everything.

58:38.280 --> 58:41.720
You're suffocating, morbid!
-Your presence is morbid!

58:42.520 --> 58:44.880
I look at you, touch you,
and see you dead!

58:45.080 --> 58:46.760
You make me want to vomit!
Go away!

58:46.960 --> 58:49.120
Yes, I wanted to hurt you!

58:49.520 --> 58:52.480
Please... forgive me.

58:53.480 --> 58:56.480
Forgive me!
I can't live alone.

58:57.040 --> 58:58.680
Please, Ismael.

58:59.880 --> 59:03.040
I want you to take me back.
I need you!

59:03.240 --> 59:06.080
I don't need you, so go away!

59:28.160 --> 59:30.040
Don't leave me.

59:31.360 --> 59:33.200
Don't leave me.

59:42.000 --> 59:43.520
Do I turn you on a little?

59:44.800 --> 59:46.360
A little.

59:48.120 --> 59:49.640
Running away?

59:50.160 --> 59:52.640
If you love me,
go see your father.

59:54.400 --> 59:58.400
Speak to him, I beg of you.
I won't have the strength.

01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:09.760
Sylvia, pick up.

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:12.720
I'm sick of your answering machine.

01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:16.800
I'm on the highway,
on the way to Paris.

01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:20.160
I'd like to know
how to find the words.

01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:25.400
I've ended things with Carlotta.

01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:27.480
She's my former life.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.400
I must reinvent myself once more.

01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:35.960
I can't do it alone.
You're my homeland.

01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:41.120
You're probably
in your mountains...

01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:44.400
...staring at the stars
and forgetting about me.

01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:48.960
I'm lost.

01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:53.080
You have to help me.

01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:57.000
Two years ago...

01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:59.080
Excuse me, it's late.

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:02.640
I'm a little bit tipsy.

01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:04.800
So have a seat.

01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:06.760
Thanks, that's kind.

01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:09.120
How about a glass of water?

01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:11.280
You don't have coffee?

01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:13.640
Sorry, I don't drink coffee.

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:15.560
Whiskey then?

01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:18.040
Yes.

01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:23.800
Here.

01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:29.720
I wanted to say that
by refusing me...

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:31.200
...you're missing out.

01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:33.480
You have to decide quickly.

01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:35.600
I won't live a thousand years!

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:40.040
I did some tests.
I can show you the results.

01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:41.680
What did the doctors say?

01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:45.200
It's not me who matters,
but I can be good for you.

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:49.560
God knows your life is austere!
-Don't hurt me.

01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:52.360
I know, we've barely met.

01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:55.360
You see a married man.
It's wonderful with him.

01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:57.640
I'm not saying to leave him.

01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:00.400
But don't miss out on me.

01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:05.480
Stop the leaves!

01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:08.040
Raise your arms like this!

01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:11.120
You all raise your arms!
Strollers in position!

01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:14.520
You up there! Get down!
Don't be a wise-ass!

01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:16.240
Where's Victor?

01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:19.200
Positions, please!

01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:21.400
We have forty minutes!

01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:26.440
What are you reading?

01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:29.880
-Flannery O'Connor.
-Any good?

01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:33.120
-You're teasing me!
-You're bored, right?

01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:34.760
Not at all.

01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:37.680
Is this the first shoot
you've ever seen?

01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:39.360
Yes.

01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:41.000
And?

01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:43.000
It seems fun.

01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:46.120
But do you always
lose your temper like that?

01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:47.720
It depends.

01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:49.680
You really scared me.

01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:54.480
-What do all these people do?
-They work.

01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:57.480
Want to wait for me?
I'm almost done.

01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:02.200
I'll wait at your place.
Give me your keys.

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:03.960
No pussyfooting around!

01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:06.080
-Hiding mistresses there?
-Tons.

01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:09.120
-Fine. Give me your keys.
-Here.

01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:12.960
In the bathroom
I bought stuff for women.

01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:15.280
Toothbrushes, lotions...

01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:19.520
Too intimidating. I'll wait here.

01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:21.720
Okay.

01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:31.520
Let me take that.

01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:36.240
Thank you.

01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:39.480
I haven't fully settled in.

01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:42.560
It's dark.

01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:46.840
Something to drink?

01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:49.360
A little scotch?
-Yes. Very good.

01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:02.600
-I have no ice.
-No problem.

01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:12.560
-Your wife?
-Yes. Carlotta.

01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:16.440
We got married at 20.

01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:19.600
-You were very young.
-One day she left.

01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:22.080
-When?
-After three years.

01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:26.480
-Where?
-I never knew. She just left.

01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:29.840
And I was alone.

01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:32.920
I lived like a widower.

01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:37.320
One day I was very drunk,
very angry.

01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:39.240
I got rid of all her pictures.
I burnt them.

01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:41.600
The next day,
no more images of her.

01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:44.560
But later I found this portrait.

01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:46.000
In the attic.

01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:48.920
My cousin painted it
when she was 17.

01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:50.960
He sold it to me.

01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:53.880
It's the only souvenir I have left.

01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:11.120
You want me to get rid of it?

01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:14.840
No, that won't be necessary.

01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:50.360
Why are you sleeping with me?

01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:52.240
Because you're old.

01:06:53.040 --> 01:06:54.320
Because...

01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:56.640
...you look like a bum.

01:06:56.960 --> 01:06:59.040
Because you're mysterious...

01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:01.200
...and I want to
penetrate your mystery.

01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:03.160
That's not enough.

01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:07.760
Because I'm a lost girl.

01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:10.160
And you'll never abandon me.

01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:15.600
I'll pull off your mask
and I'll make a prince of you.

01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:21.240
Hello. Hi.

01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:24.840
-Are the actors here?
-Yes, they are.

01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:26.840
Watching the dailies?

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:32.200
You okay? Ismael's not here?

01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:33.920
We're all waiting.

01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:36.480
-No director.
-First time.

01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:39.040
-He's not home?
-He slept out.

01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:40.560
-Who has he slept with?
-What?

01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:44.240
Who is he screwing?
Actress, script girl?

01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:46.040
Do your job, dammit!

01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:48.200
He overslept in some broad's bed.

01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:49.880
Is Faunia here?
-In make-up.

01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:56.520
Faunia! Here you are!

01:07:56.720 --> 01:07:58.560
What did I say? Get out!

01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:02.320
-Are we alone?
-Just me.

01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:06.040
Faunia, I have some good news
and some bad.

01:08:06.600 --> 01:08:09.680
To start with the good news:
no rewrites today.

01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:12.080
Now the bad.

01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:14.400
Ismael isn't here.

01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:16.560
Sorry to ask so bluntly.

01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:18.680
Where is he?
-I have no idea.

01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:20.640
Nonsense, sweetie.

01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:22.520
I saw him last night.

01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:25.200
-Did he drink?
-I'm not a cop.

01:08:25.399 --> 01:08:27.279
Sorry. Have you had sex?

01:08:27.479 --> 01:08:30.439
-Zwy, please!
-When did you leave?

01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:33.880
At dawn. Why?

01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:37.439
He disappeared.
I checked his apartment.

01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:38.880
It's empty.

01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:40.200
He escaped?

01:08:40.399 --> 01:08:42.439
He must be with Sylvia.
So tell me.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.960
Where can I find Sylvia?
-Sylvia left him.

01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:14.840
I've run away
to the city of my birth.

01:09:16.319 --> 01:09:19.319
Here I am, finally home.

01:09:26.479 --> 01:09:28.600
And I am in exile.

01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:42.439
No river here.

01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:45.359
But the canal blocks the city.

01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:48.720
A filthy, stinking canal.

01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:51.439
Swamps stagnate under the streets.

01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:55.200
Nothing should ever be built
on such unhealthy ground.

01:09:56.680 --> 01:09:58.360
One thousand years later...

01:09:58.560 --> 01:10:01.480
...the water is
still rotting, oozing.

01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:05.320
Emanations, humidity...

01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:07.640
...cold.

01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:16.000
The people here are ugly, defeated.

01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:19.600
For years
I haven't seen my face in a mirror.

01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:22.800
I feel at peace.

01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:34.560
Hello.

01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:38.640
My name is Carlotta Bloom,
and I'm back.

01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:40.960
Excuse me?

01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:43.680
I'm back.

01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:47.280
You can put my name
back in your register.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:52.000
I don't understand.
Put your name in what register?

01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:54.960
I don't know.

01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:58.160
There must be a register
for the living.

01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:00.360
You have a register for the dead.

01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:02.600
I'm a missing person.

01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:05.840
Missing persons
is that counter there.

01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:13.240
Did you lose someone?

01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:15.280
Don't talk to me.

01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:18.400
You look like my wife.

01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:20.360
Look somewhere else!

01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:22.560
What's your name?

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.640
Carlotta Bloom.

01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:26.600
Double O.

01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:28.520
Like the director?

01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:30.120
I'm his daughter.

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:33.880
How long have you been
declared missing for?

01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:35.560
I don't know.

01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:37.480
Anything in your files?

01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:41.520
You were judged "absent" in court
eight years ago.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.320
-By whom?
-The magistrate.

01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:47.480
At the request of Ismael Vuillard.

01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:49.560
Your husband.

01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:51.520
What must I do?

01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:54.640
Have the Ministère Public
nullify the judgment.

01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:57.520
You'll get back your estate as is.

01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:01.400
Can I get my husband back?

01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:05.880
No, the former missing person's
marriage remains nullified.

01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:32.160
I'm at 160 beats a minute.

01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:34.360
I measured the oxygenation
of my blood.

01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:36.560
It's like I have sleep apnea.

01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:39.120
So my rest is the opposite of rest.

01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:43.440
-Is it alcohol-related?
-No, no.

01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:48.160
It could be a form of epilepsy,
but it's very rare.

01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:51.280
I read there's a gene
that causes nightmares.

01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:55.400
HLA DQB1-05.

01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:58.800
Can we see if my DNA has that gene?

01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:02.480
You're exhausted.

01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:06.880
I can prescribe you some lorazepam
or diazepam.

01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:11.160
You'll sleep heavily.
It suppresses sleep stages 2 and 3.

01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:15.080
It will really help.
-I don't want to sleep at all.

01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:18.280
Or else, sever my hypothalamus.

01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:19.560
Excuse me?

01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:21.440
I don't want to dream.

01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:25.040
You must sever my hypothalamus.
-I'm not severing anything.

01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:26.600
I can pay.

01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:28.080
It's not about money.

01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:30.800
What I can do is...

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.920
...try to inject you with dopamine
before you fall asleep.

01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:35.640
I'll do it myself.

01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:37.480
What does dopamine do?

01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:40.480
It feeds the nightmare gland.
It'll soothe you.

01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:41.640
Really?

01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:45.320
But you must sleep in the hospital.
It must be supervised.

01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:47.320
I won't go to the hospital.

01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:51.480
-Is Ivan here?
-No.

01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:54.400
I went to high school with him.

01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:57.400
Still a diplomat?
-Yes.

01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:05.800
Khujand Prison, Tajikistan

01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:17.920
-So, how did it go?
-Very well.

01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:19.240
Who did you meet?

01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:21.440
-Prisoners.
-Political?

01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:23.280
As well.

01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:25.800
When will you get a license?

01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:31.160
You look like a bum.

01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:33.880
Hello.

01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:35.680
Give me your gum.

01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:37.120
Mr. Dedalus?

01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:39.920
The new security chief is waiting
in your office.

01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:46.720
Good afternoon.

01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:47.760
Hello.

01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:54.360
You kept the same combination
as before?

01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:57.040
Better to change it, so I did.

01:15:57.600 --> 01:16:00.480
Memorize the new code
and destroy this.

01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:02.080
Here.

01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:06.160
Sorry,
this is a little embarrassing.

01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:10.200
I see you opened the safe.
-I couldn't resist.

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:13.440
I've done drugs since I was a teen.

01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:17.080
I wouldn't want my habit
to be a problem for work.

01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:18.440
It depends.

01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:21.840
-What kind of drugs?
-Hash or weed.

01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:25.560
Maybe an LSD on the weekend.
-You don't carry it on you.

01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:29.360
You carry it on you?

01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:33.040
That's not smart.

01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:34.600
Sorry to be prosaic.

01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:36.960
If I don't find any here,
what do I do?

01:16:37.160 --> 01:16:41.240
Have it sent by diplomatic pouch
to the embassy.

01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:44.720
Got a friend to send it?
-Yes, in Roubaix.

01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:54.160
A gray one.

01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:56.120
And a brown one.

01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:05.000
So listen, I met...

01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:07.720
What?

01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:10.640
Where are you going?

01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:13.200
I think we're bugged.

01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:15.320
-So let's remove them.
-No!

01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:17.600
They'll get upset
and make it worse.

01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:19.800
-Who?
-The Tajik police!

01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:23.200
Being bugged is part of your job,
my love.

01:17:39.960 --> 01:17:42.080
Arielle! What's wrong?

01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:46.520
-What is it?
-Look.

01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:49.720
They wanted us to know they came.
It's terrifying.

01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:09.120
These aren't Tajik mikes.

01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:10.640
Nice stuff.

01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:13.600
They cost a fortune in the States.

01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:15.840
Never saw this model here.

01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:18.720
Maybe the Tajiks went modern.

01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:20.120
Probably.

01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:22.080
Who would plant mikes here?

01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:25.920
This week you went to the Khujand
prison.

01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:28.040
Yes.

01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:30.040
Did you see this man?

01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:34.160
-I'm not sure.
-It's an old photo.

01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:36.280
It's Imam Farias.

01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:38.080
Who's Farias?

01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:41.640
One of the most wanted men
in the world.

01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:47.200
Arrested
during the first Afghan war.

01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:49.640
He was 25.

01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:52.640
Every agency has traded him.

01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:56.880
He's known every prison
and detention camp.

01:18:57.840 --> 01:18:59.480
We lost track of him.

01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:03.000
You're the first Westerner
to see him in 20 years.

01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:04.880
What did you discuss?

01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:07.200
That man has lost his mind.

01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:09.800
He couldn't remember his own name.

01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:13.080
How many lives have you had?

01:19:15.720 --> 01:19:17.120
Like everyone.

01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:19.520
Meaning?

01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:22.200
Two or three.

01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:37.040
You're in room 3.

01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:41.040
Did you give me telescope hours?

01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:43.440
Yes, starting tonight.

01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:45.040
See you later.

01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:53.720
I'll tear off your mask.

01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:56.280
I'll turn you into...

01:20:56.840 --> 01:20:58.200
...a prince!

01:21:30.040 --> 01:21:31.200
You didn't ring?

01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:33.000
-Would you have opened?
-No.

01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:36.360
I figured you'd come out
sooner or later.

01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:38.840
-You want my coffee?
-Thank you.

01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:46.000
Your parents' house?
-My great-aunt's.

01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:49.480
How did you find me?

01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:52.720
With your credit card receipts.

01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:55.760
I promised your banker
I'd pay the overdraft.

01:21:56.880 --> 01:21:58.160
How are you?

01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:00.880
Well, I have a film on hold.

01:22:01.080 --> 01:22:04.400
Insurance stops next week.
The producer wants you dead.

01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:06.840
I lied to the actors
to save your reputation.

01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:08.400
Same as usual.

01:22:09.480 --> 01:22:12.160
-You didn't give my address?
-Never!

01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:15.720
I want you to call Sylvia.

01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:19.000
I'll make you eggs, sunny side up.

01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:24.560
Did you see? I bought hens.

01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:28.600
Should I build a coop?

01:22:28.840 --> 01:22:31.000
No. Finish your film.

01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:32.640
I need you.

01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:35.200
I'd like you to need me.

01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:38.920
Is it the subject?
You're afraid of the subject.

01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:41.360
How long have I been making movies?

01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:46.680
My assistants or the producer
can finish. I won't go back.

01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:48.240
Whatever you say.

01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:52.200
I'll belt you, put you in my trunk
and take you back.

01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:56.200
You're less strong
and you hate fights.

01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:57.640
Maybe.

01:22:57.840 --> 01:22:59.720
But you've been drinking.

01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:03.160
I'm armed.

01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:06.400
I doubt you could shoot.

01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:09.240
You like me.
-Yes.

01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:12.920
You're old, my friend!

01:23:13.240 --> 01:23:14.920
We're both old!

01:23:15.280 --> 01:23:18.320
All you can do is direct.
You're too old to change!

01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:20.800
I could teach. Literature.

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.360
You'll never find a school.
Or a student.

01:23:23.560 --> 01:23:26.160
I'm in poor health.
I won't be around long.

01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:28.920
Guess again!
It can go on forever! Look at me!

01:23:29.120 --> 01:23:31.840
For decades I've sworn
never to work with you again...

01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:35.880
...and here I am in your yard,
chasing after f..ing hens!

01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:39.000
Come closer!

01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:41.560
Closer.

01:23:47.480 --> 01:23:49.080
1437.

01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:51.040
1434.

01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:53.640
The invention of perspective
in the Occident.

01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:55.720
In the North.

01:23:55.960 --> 01:23:57.400
And the South.

01:24:00.960 --> 01:24:03.400
-What's the point?
-Look.

01:24:04.120 --> 01:24:05.960
Different perspectives.

01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:09.520
They thought they had
one universal system...

01:24:09.720 --> 01:24:12.040
...but in fact there were two.

01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:14.200
From Holland to Italy...

01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:17.360
...there was an incredible
force-field!

01:24:17.560 --> 01:24:20.160
An incredible hate
which destroys everything.

01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:22.120
I'm not a Jew you can piss off.

01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:23.840
Screw your Christian guilt.

01:24:24.040 --> 01:24:29.640
If we understood the logic of it,
it would annihilate all hate.

01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:35.320
Ismael...
It's time to go back to Paris.

01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:46.600
Hello, Mr. Bloom!

01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:50.680
-How are you doing?
-Great.

01:24:56.640 --> 01:24:58.480
One red pepper.

01:24:58.680 --> 01:25:00.600
-Will that be all?
-Thanks.

01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:03.240
You're welcome, Mr Bloom.
Good bye.

01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:33.800
No! Go away!

01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:37.520
Go away!

01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:41.240
Hello?

01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:43.440
This is Henri Bloom.

01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:48.480
I need to speak to Ismael
immediately.

01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:52.040
Hello, miss?

01:25:53.680 --> 01:25:55.360
Ismael isn't here, Mr. Bloom.

01:25:55.960 --> 01:25:59.600
I see my daughter outside,
out the window.

01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:02.440
She cannot be alive.

01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:04.440
She came back.

01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:08.520
I saw her. At the sea. We spoke.
She stayed with us.

01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:11.160
Why didn't she come to see me?

01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:13.160
I don't know, sir.

01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:15.760
Ismael was afraid to tell you.

01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:19.680
No, it's too late now.

01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:21.360
I'm too old.

01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:23.520
She's no longer my daughter.

01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:25.400
But you're still her father.

01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:27.240
Miss...

01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:29.200
I'm going to die.

01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:31.560
You're not going to die!

01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:34.160
Go see her!
What are you waiting for?

01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:38.120
I understand that she's afraid,
but aren't you brave?

01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:40.960
I'm an old man.

01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:46.000
I loved Carlotta and I mourned her.

01:26:46.440 --> 01:26:48.000
And now...

01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:02.320
The producers don't understand
the Czech dailies.

01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:05.800
Your editor is at a loss:
no dialogue!

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:07.840
The sound man was a prick!

01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:09.680
Fire whoever you want.

01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:12.520
All we see are silhouettes
with moving lips!

01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:14.640
For voice-over scenes.

01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:16.480
Just add a narrator.

01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:18.720
I'm not adding a thing.

01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:21.240
Let the editor add narration.

01:27:21.680 --> 01:27:23.800
-Who's the narrator?
-Claverie.

01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:28.920
The scene where Ivan is hired.
-The old unctuous guy.

01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:30.600
Claverie.

01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:33.520
He was stationed in Warsaw
under Gierek.

01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:35.920
Everyone thought he was a mole.

01:27:36.120 --> 01:27:38.760
-A communist mole?
-But it wasn't true!

01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:40.440
Intel found nothing.

01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:44.600
So Claverie ended up mothballed.
A mere pencil pusher.

01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:48.520
After Dushanbe,
Ivan gets named to...

01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:50.520
...Prague.

01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:53.360
When he gets there...

01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:56.480
...who greets him
with a wolfish smile?

01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:02.640
Claverie!

01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:04.600
Ambassador once again!

01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:08.960
Ivan starts his humdrum
civil servant life, but...

01:28:09.240 --> 01:28:12.000
...he still has a knack
for languages.

01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:14.480
He wants to learn Romani.

01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:17.960
So he hangs around beggars.
The beggarwoman.

01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:21.080
What does she tell him?

01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:27.760
"Your mother's cunt".
An insult, no sound needed.

01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:32.160
The security guy hates Ivan
because he has no cell phone.

01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:35.040
You must be reachable!

01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:38.840
I can always call the embassy
from a pay phone.

01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:43.480
A gift.

01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:50.120
And there in Prague,
Ivan meets his Russian.

01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:54.320
Imagine a Jackson Pollock exhibit
in Prague.

01:28:54.520 --> 01:28:57.160
His first in an
Eastern-bloc country.

01:28:57.440 --> 01:29:00.840
The Americans invite every embassy,
to show off.

01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:04.600
Ivan is there,
alone in front of "Lavender Mist".

01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:09.480
And this Russian sits next to him,
a little drunk on champagne.

01:29:09.800 --> 01:29:12.080
They start talking about Pollock.

01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:14.440
-Saying?
-That's he's figurative.

01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:15.760
-Pollock?
-Yes.

01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:19.320
They're compressed images,
always the same.

01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:24.000
His family, his dog, his mother,
the brother he hated.

01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:28.880
"Lavender Mist" is all the women
he could never touch.

01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:33.080
Not Lee Krasner,
but gentle, tender women.

01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:36.760
Nipples, shoulders,
lips, vaginas...

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:40.040
...30 female nudes,
all stuck together.

01:29:40.240 --> 01:29:42.360
A reprise of
"Demoiselles d'Avignon".

01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:45.840
Both men speak
in front of the painting.

01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:48.160
The Russian understands it all.

01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:50.280
He says he loves him,
they're brothers.

01:29:50.480 --> 01:29:52.440
He wrote a PhD in Moscow!

01:29:52.640 --> 01:29:55.080
The brothers' names
appear all over.

01:29:55.280 --> 01:29:57.720
Consonants, vowels, knives!

01:29:57.920 --> 01:30:00.280
Pollock's rape
in front his brother.

01:30:00.480 --> 01:30:01.520
How awful.

01:30:01.720 --> 01:30:03.160
Yes, he had a sad life.

01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:06.080
In the museum,
the men become friends.

01:30:06.280 --> 01:30:08.160
-Are you French?
-Yes.

01:30:08.360 --> 01:30:11.000
-You're not Czech?
-I'm Russian.

01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:13.640
Then you put the roof scene.

01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:17.320
They look at Prague,
the night, the stars.

01:30:17.640 --> 01:30:20.640
The Russian's wife,
the two children playing.

01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:24.800
Keep quiet! Please!
For a moment!

01:30:25.040 --> 01:30:27.880
The Russian gives Ivan a present.

01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:30.720
A coffee machine
or a teddy bear for Arielle.

01:30:30.920 --> 01:30:33.920
For you! A Russian bear!

01:30:37.440 --> 01:30:39.760
And I shot the rest.

01:30:40.480 --> 01:30:42.040
I love your kids.

01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:43.600
I love you all.

01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:45.240
You're crazy.

01:30:48.920 --> 01:30:51.560
I drank so much
I think I'm going to die!

01:30:51.760 --> 01:30:53.320
You drunkard!

01:30:53.520 --> 01:30:55.160
Yes, love me.

01:30:55.480 --> 01:30:57.120
Love me!

01:31:01.720 --> 01:31:02.840
Vanya...

01:31:03.240 --> 01:31:05.560
My heart, full of gratitude.

01:31:06.600 --> 01:31:07.720
Why?

01:31:07.920 --> 01:31:11.040
I published an article
in a Moscow review.

01:31:11.600 --> 01:31:13.400
Jackson Pollock!

01:31:15.400 --> 01:31:16.920
Now, I've become...

01:31:17.400 --> 01:31:20.440
...very famous in my country
thanks to you!

01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:22.120
Thanks to our talk!

01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:25.360
-I'm thrilled.
-We must share the money.

01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:28.520
What money?

01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:31.080
That I made with the article.

01:31:36.760 --> 01:31:40.200
No, no. I don't want money, Igor.

01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:43.080
-Are you my friend or not?
-Sure I'm your friend.

01:31:43.400 --> 01:31:45.440
So you must share my joy!

01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:55.200
He's Russian.
He gave me a lot of money.

01:31:55.400 --> 01:31:56.760
How much?

01:31:58.640 --> 01:32:00.080
100,000 euros.

01:32:00.560 --> 01:32:01.920
We just talked painting.

01:32:02.120 --> 01:32:03.880
These were his other gifts.

01:32:05.800 --> 01:32:07.680
Plastic flowers for me.

01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:11.280
A coffee machine. A teddy bear.

01:32:12.040 --> 01:32:13.320
Not to offend him.

01:32:13.520 --> 01:32:14.560
You're both irresponsible!

01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:18.400
Ivan is giving you
the name of a secret agent...

01:32:18.680 --> 01:32:20.360
...that you didn't spot.

01:32:20.640 --> 01:32:22.760
He's exposed, as it were.

01:32:23.280 --> 01:32:24.800
We'll nab this scumbag.

01:32:35.160 --> 01:32:37.880
They follow the Russian
through Prague.

01:33:03.120 --> 01:33:05.200
Pretend to bump into him.

01:33:05.400 --> 01:33:07.400
My men at the Slavia café
are watching.

01:33:20.680 --> 01:33:22.440
Igor!

01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:49.960
Follow me!

01:33:54.760 --> 01:33:56.320
I don't want you to die.

01:33:57.080 --> 01:33:58.720
I'm not dying, honey.

01:33:58.920 --> 01:34:04.320
Wake up! I don't want you to die!
You married me, so live!

01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:06.400
What is this crap?

01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:09.920
A Russian blows up in Prague
and no idea who did it?

01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:12.400
The Russians maybe.

01:34:12.600 --> 01:34:15.400
I have Moscow on my ass.
They want my head.

01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:18.200
He was probably an FSB agent.

01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:21.560
Igor wasn't FSB.
Just an ordinary employee.

01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:26.000
100,000 euros, what Igor left,
is far from ordinary.

01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:29.800
You're precious, Ivan.

01:34:30.360 --> 01:34:34.040
Now tell me what you know
and what that sum buys.

01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:35.360
I don't know what I know!

01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:39.120
I wanted to ask,
but he got killed first!

01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:42.080
-My husband is a spy.
-What?

01:34:43.120 --> 01:34:44.760
My husband is a spy!

01:34:45.160 --> 01:34:48.200
That guy at the Khujand prison.
-Who?

01:34:48.720 --> 01:34:52.120
His name was Farias.
Igor wanted Farias.

01:34:52.360 --> 01:34:53.720
Save my husband!

01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:56.400
Who did Igor work for?
Who did he call?

01:34:56.600 --> 01:34:57.680
I have no idea!

01:34:58.720 --> 01:35:01.320
-Who did Igor work for?
-Who do you work for?

01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:02.160
I don't know!

01:35:02.360 --> 01:35:04.040
-What did he want?
-No idea!

01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:05.360
Who do you work for?

01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:10.960
My God! Don't touch me!

01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:13.200
I hurt you! I'm sorry!

01:35:13.400 --> 01:35:15.480
Stay away, you old schnook!

01:35:16.920 --> 01:35:18.240
Don't cry for me.

01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:20.920
It'll hurt on three. One, two...

01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:22.720
There we go.

01:35:23.520 --> 01:35:25.080
I got the bullet.

01:35:25.640 --> 01:35:26.920
Clean wound.

01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:29.000
Sedate him before we all die.

01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:37.720
I won't congratulate you.

01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:38.800
I'm sorry.

01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:40.680
I was over-enthused...
-Shut up!

01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:42.160
He'll survive.

01:35:42.360 --> 01:35:43.600
-You in pain?
-Yes.

01:35:43.800 --> 01:35:45.760
You're coming undone, Vuillard.

01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:54.480
He won't suffocate?

01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:57.800
No way. He's used to this.
He's a solid smoker!

01:36:00.920 --> 01:36:03.200
Because I think he's kicking.

01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:08.760
-You'll finish this film!
-He'll finish it.

01:36:08.960 --> 01:36:11.960
You hear me? You'll finish it!

01:36:12.160 --> 01:36:13.680
You'll finish it!
-Zwy!

01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:41.160
Feeling better?

01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:44.040
Yes, much better, thanks. And you?

01:36:44.520 --> 01:36:47.680
Straight through the muscle
to the radius.

01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:50.120
I may never be able
to bend my elbow!

01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:51.800
I'm so embarrassed!

01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:53.560
You better be.

01:36:55.200 --> 01:36:56.680
I called Sylvia.

01:36:56.880 --> 01:36:58.480
-No!
-Yes.

01:36:58.920 --> 01:37:02.520
Insurance covers
the two-week break.

01:37:02.800 --> 01:37:06.360
It's time to write.
Sylvia said you like working here.

01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:11.280
I know you're angry and in pain,
but can you untie me?

01:37:11.920 --> 01:37:13.120
No.

01:37:13.640 --> 01:37:16.680
-Don't leave me.
-She'll be here soon.

01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:19.280
Don't leave me! Zwy!

01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:21.400
Zwy!

01:37:34.760 --> 01:37:36.160
Sorry.

01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:41.040
No way!
You shot your line producer?

01:37:41.960 --> 01:37:43.160
Yes.

01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:46.280
Will you keep me prisoner?

01:37:46.680 --> 01:37:47.960
Yes!

01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:49.280
My love!

01:37:50.560 --> 01:37:52.080
My love.

01:37:56.720 --> 01:37:58.280
The Bloom girl is here.

01:37:58.480 --> 01:37:59.360
I'll see her.

01:37:59.560 --> 01:38:01.400
The patient has refused
family visits.

01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:03.240
She's already there.

01:38:03.920 --> 01:38:05.400
No.

01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:28.800
Ma'am...

01:38:31.560 --> 01:38:33.080
Are you his doctor?

01:38:33.640 --> 01:38:35.640
There is no visiting.

01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:38.040
How is he?

01:38:40.680 --> 01:38:42.320
Does he have his head?

01:38:42.520 --> 01:38:44.920
He was calm when he woke up.

01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:49.640
-Is he warm enough?
-Yes, ma'am.

01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:52.360
You must leave now.

01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:54.640
Your father needs calm.

01:38:55.160 --> 01:38:58.040
I'll wait. I won't speak to him.

01:38:59.200 --> 01:39:00.680
Go home.

01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:03.320
We'll call you with news.
-No.

01:39:04.120 --> 01:39:06.160
I'll wait till he wakes up.

01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:14.560
Father!

01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:17.800
Do you recognize me?

01:39:19.280 --> 01:39:21.480
You are a spirit, I know.

01:39:23.160 --> 01:39:24.760
When did you die?

01:39:25.240 --> 01:39:26.640
I'm not dead.

01:39:28.280 --> 01:39:30.800
-He doesn't recognize me.
-He's waking up.

01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:32.480
Leave him a bit.

01:39:33.160 --> 01:39:34.480
Where are my hands?

01:39:36.520 --> 01:39:38.200
Where are my hands?

01:39:38.600 --> 01:39:41.080
Leave me alone!

01:39:41.280 --> 01:39:43.120
10 mg of Valium.

01:39:47.800 --> 01:39:49.360
He's tied up at night.

01:39:49.680 --> 01:39:52.600
You have five minutes,
then you must go.

01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:10.600
Father? Feel my forehead.

01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:15.120
I want you to bless me.

01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:17.640
I'm an old man.

01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:22.800
Do not mock me
if I don't know where I am.

01:40:23.240 --> 01:40:25.080
You're in the hospital.

01:40:26.040 --> 01:40:27.720
And you'll get better.

01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:31.240
I think I recognize you.

01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:34.320
You're my child?

01:40:37.120 --> 01:40:38.600
It's me.

01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:43.040
You're crying?

01:40:44.200 --> 01:40:46.800
There's no reason to cry.

01:40:47.080 --> 01:40:49.720
No, none.

01:40:50.680 --> 01:40:52.880
Do you understand me?

01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:55.280
You mean can I hear you?

01:40:56.280 --> 01:40:57.880
Yes, I hear you well.

01:40:58.080 --> 01:40:59.920
No, I mean...

01:41:00.400 --> 01:41:02.640
Am I making sense?

01:41:03.880 --> 01:41:05.960
Sometimes I get confused.

01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:08.440
You're perfectly clear, Dad.

01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:11.760
Why do you ask?

01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:16.040
Why are there all these doctors...

01:41:16.240 --> 01:41:20.240
...and all these nurses
running in and out of my room...

01:41:20.440 --> 01:41:22.720
...as if there is an emergency?

01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:27.280
You know they had to place
a pacemaker for your heart?

01:41:27.840 --> 01:41:30.120
Yes, that's what I mean.

01:41:30.440 --> 01:41:32.000
How old am I?

01:41:32.720 --> 01:41:34.160
Eighty-three.

01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:36.880
So what's the emergency?

01:41:37.200 --> 01:41:38.360
Enough!

01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:40.120
It's natural.

01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:44.840
If a child is sick,
that's an emergency.

01:41:45.880 --> 01:41:49.720
But running
in and out of my room...

01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:54.720
...just because an 83-year-old man
is dying...

01:41:56.120 --> 01:41:57.840
...is no emergency.

01:41:59.160 --> 01:42:01.600
It's ugly to behave like that.

01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:04.040
They're just doing their job.

01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:07.840
Placing a pacemaker
has become a standard procedure.

01:42:09.400 --> 01:42:11.400
So I have no choice?

01:42:12.800 --> 01:42:14.600
I don't know.

01:42:16.040 --> 01:42:18.080
Tell them to stop.

01:42:19.120 --> 01:42:20.800
That's not my job.

01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:32.880
You're wondering how it ended?

01:42:33.760 --> 01:42:36.800
Bloom died,
and his daughter left.

01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:41.040
Ismael mourned his friend
for a while.

01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:45.160
He thought that Bloom was
indestructible.

01:42:46.040 --> 01:42:49.520
He liked living in his shadow,
like under a tree.

01:42:51.400 --> 01:42:54.520
He still travels the world
to show his films.

01:42:56.320 --> 01:42:59.440
Ismael never mentions Bloom to me.

01:43:00.520 --> 01:43:02.600
Because the sobs come back.

01:43:07.240 --> 01:43:10.160
One day, during the spring...

01:43:11.200 --> 01:43:12.920
...my period stopped.

01:43:14.040 --> 01:43:15.600
And I thought...

01:43:15.800 --> 01:43:17.600
...with great sadness...

01:43:18.400 --> 01:43:20.560
...that age had caught up to me.

01:43:21.680 --> 01:43:23.040
And then...

01:43:24.680 --> 01:43:26.320
...I was expecting a child.

01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:31.000
Ismael is overjoyed.

01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:33.720
He keeps counting on his fingers...

01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:36.960
...how old he'll be
when our child is 15.

01:43:38.400 --> 01:43:42.760
He loves to say
that we'll be elderly parents.

01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:47.160
Last week...

01:43:47.360 --> 01:43:51.640
...I visited my brother
in the clinic where he is staying.

01:43:52.680 --> 01:43:56.000
I told him the news.
"I'm pregnant."

01:43:58.520 --> 01:44:00.600
Pierre made a strange face.

01:44:02.280 --> 01:44:03.840
Then he smiled.

01:44:04.720 --> 01:44:07.680
I think he thought
it was the right thing to do.

01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:11.000
I took his hand...

01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:14.640
...and put it on my belly.

01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:18.840
I watched Pierre, surprised.

01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:21.720
He looked at my belly...

01:44:22.920 --> 01:44:24.640
...and understood...

01:44:25.160 --> 01:44:27.800
...he's no longer my child anymore.

01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:33.840
In one fell swoop, he lost a mother
and a wife.

01:44:35.480 --> 01:44:37.160
He felt...

01:44:38.200 --> 01:44:39.880
...great anger.

01:44:41.920 --> 01:44:43.680
But my brother's tenderness...

01:44:45.440 --> 01:44:48.480
...and his desire to protect me
are so strong...

01:44:50.120 --> 01:44:51.960
...that he hid his feelings.

01:44:52.160 --> 01:44:54.560
But I saw.

01:44:55.480 --> 01:44:57.400
I saw his jealousy.

01:44:58.440 --> 01:45:00.280
His disarray.

01:45:04.960 --> 01:45:07.160
Life has come to me.

01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:10.760
I'm pregnant with Ismael's child.

01:45:17.760 --> 01:45:20.560
-Working?
-Yes, working again.

01:45:20.880 --> 01:45:22.120
Again.

01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:24.440
-Again.
-Again.

01:45:24.640 --> 01:45:26.120
-Again.
-Again.

01:45:26.600 --> 01:45:28.280
-Again.
-Again.

01:45:28.760 --> 01:45:30.400
-Again.
-Again.

01:45:30.960 --> 01:45:32.760
-Again.
-Again.

01:45:39.400 --> 01:45:40.680
-Again.
-Again.

01:45:41.840 --> 01:45:43.760
Again.

01:45:44.440 --> 01:45:46.160
Again.
