00:12.728 --> 00:14.179
OH, LEAVE IT.

00:14.246 --> 00:15.596
WHAT WAS IT?

00:15.715 --> 00:17.515
A SPECIAL ON
THE AZTEC RUINS.

00:17.583 --> 00:19.151
UNLESS IT'S
BOOBS OR FOOTBALL,

00:19.218 --> 00:21.920
I AIN'T SLOWING DOWN.

00:23.622 --> 00:25.323
IT'S ACTUALLY
VERY FASCINATING.

00:25.391 --> 00:26.925
GIVE IT UP, SPENCE.

00:26.992 --> 00:28.226
WE'RE NOT SPENDING
OUR VACATION

00:28.294 --> 00:30.128
ON AN ARCHEOLOGICAL DIG.

00:30.196 --> 00:32.797
WE HAVE TO DECIDE
SOMEPLACE TO GO.

00:32.865 --> 00:35.249
HOW ABOUT
BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN?

00:40.422 --> 00:43.007
LOOK, I HAVE AN AIRLINE
COMPANION TICKET.

00:43.075 --> 00:45.243
IT EXPIRES IF I DON'T
USE IT IN TWO WEEKS.

00:45.311 --> 00:47.178
WE SHOULD BE USING IT
TO GO TO VEGAS.

00:47.246 --> 00:49.180
SO I CAN WATCH YOU LOSE
OUR REDECORATING MONEY?

00:49.248 --> 00:51.249
NO, THANKS.

00:51.317 --> 00:52.367
YOU KNOW WHAT, GUYS?

00:52.435 --> 00:54.268
IT'S GETTING LATE
AND THIS WHOLE CONVERSATION

00:54.337 --> 00:57.004
IS MAKING ME FEEL...
BAD INSIDE.

00:57.072 --> 00:58.473
SO, UH, COME ON.

00:58.541 --> 01:00.508
YOU'RE KICKING US OUT?

01:00.576 --> 01:02.060
NOT PHYSICALLY.
THAT WOULD BE A HATE CRIME.

01:02.128 --> 01:03.295
COME ON.

01:09.468 --> 01:11.136
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GOING TO SLEEP.

01:11.203 --> 01:13.088
OH, YEAH.
I'M JUST READING.

01:13.155 --> 01:16.074
BIOGRAPHY OF
ELEANOR ROOSEVELT.

01:16.142 --> 01:20.145
WOW. YOU GOT TO FLOAT THAT
BY ME WHEN YOU'RE DONE.

01:44.871 --> 01:46.337
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:46.405 --> 01:49.424
SAYING MY PRAYERS.

01:49.491 --> 01:51.692
DOUG, HOW MANY TIMES
HAVE I ASKED YOU

01:51.760 --> 01:53.194
NOT TO EAT IN BED?

01:53.262 --> 01:55.630
I'M SORRY, AND OUT OF
RESPECT FOR YOU,

01:55.698 --> 01:57.098
I TRIED TO HIDE IT.

01:57.165 --> 01:58.066
I'M SERIOUS.

01:58.217 --> 01:59.984
LOOK, YOU GOT POPPY SEEDS
ALL OVER THE BED.

02:00.052 --> 02:01.419
FIRST OF ALL,

02:01.487 --> 02:04.556
THERE ARE NO POPPY SEEDS ON A
DOUG HEFFERNAN SANDWICH, AND...

02:04.623 --> 02:06.891
THOSE ARE MOVING.

02:13.348 --> 02:15.349
OK...

02:15.417 --> 02:17.852
WELL, I CHECKED
THE BEDROOM.

02:17.920 --> 02:19.153
GREAT NEWS.

02:19.221 --> 02:20.622
OH, THANK GOD.

02:20.690 --> 02:22.757
LET ME FINISH.

02:22.825 --> 02:25.310
GREAT NEWS
IF YOU LOVE BEDBUGS.

02:25.378 --> 02:28.380
'CAUSE YOU GOT
A CRAPLOAD FULL OF THEM.

02:29.632 --> 02:31.766
BEDBUGS? REALLY?
IS THAT A REAL THING?

02:31.834 --> 02:34.986
THERE'S A LOT OF MYTHS
ABOUT BEDBUGS,

02:35.054 --> 02:37.222
BUT ONE THING'S
FOR CERTAIN-

02:37.289 --> 02:42.227
THEY'RE AS DISEASE-RIDDEN
AS A ONE-EYED WHORE.

02:42.294 --> 02:44.945
I TOLD YOU
NOT TO EAT IN BED.

02:45.013 --> 02:46.831
THAT'S ANOTHER MYTH
ABOUT BEDBUGS.

02:46.899 --> 02:49.700
THEY'RE NOT FOOD SCAVENGERS.
THEY FEED OFF HUMAN BLOOD.

02:49.768 --> 02:51.702
TAKE A LOOK AT HOW ENGORGED
THAT BAD BOY IS.

02:51.770 --> 02:53.238
OH, MY GOD.

02:53.305 --> 02:55.523
LOOKS LIKE THE GUY
THAT BIT ME LAST NIGHT.

02:55.591 --> 02:57.041
OOH,
WHERE'D HE GET YOU?

02:57.109 --> 02:58.159
RIGHT IN THE LEG.

02:58.226 --> 03:00.995
LET'S HAVE
A LITTLE LOOK-SEE.

03:01.063 --> 03:04.248
I'M ACTUALLY...
I'M GOOD.

03:04.316 --> 03:05.616
SCOOCH UP THOSE PANTS.

03:05.684 --> 03:08.119
COME ON, CHOP, CHOP.
THERE WE GO.

03:12.725 --> 03:15.427
OK...

03:19.131 --> 03:21.299
SO, HOW'S IT LOOKING
DOWN THERE?

03:21.366 --> 03:23.167
I DO NOT LIKE
THE LOOK OF THAT MOLE.

03:23.235 --> 03:24.269
OK, YOU KNOW WHAT?

03:24.353 --> 03:27.555
HOW ABOUT THE BUG BITE?
WHAT ABOUT THE BITE?

03:27.622 --> 03:31.276
WELL, IT'S ODD. IT'S ONE
OF THE LARGER STRAINS,

03:31.343 --> 03:33.311
USUALLY FOUND IN
MORE HUMID CLIMATES.

03:33.379 --> 03:35.262
HAVE YOU GUYS BEEN DOWN
TO THE CARIBBEAN

03:35.330 --> 03:36.347
OR FLORIDA RECENTLY?

03:36.415 --> 03:37.482
NO.

03:37.549 --> 03:39.784
YOUR DAD WAS.

03:39.851 --> 03:41.185
THAT'S RIGHT.

03:41.253 --> 03:42.853
HE STAYED AT THAT MOTEL
IN BOYNTON BEACH.

03:42.921 --> 03:44.121
THINK HE GOT IT
FROM THERE?

03:44.189 --> 03:46.240
DID HE BRING ANYTHING
BACK FROM THE MOTEL,

03:46.308 --> 03:48.609
LIKE A TOWEL
OR A WASHCLOTH?

03:48.677 --> 03:51.462
NO, BUT HE DID BRING
BACK A SET OF SHEETS!

03:55.334 --> 03:57.835
YEP. AND A LAMP.

03:59.505 --> 04:01.205
BINGO.
WHERE IS HE NOW?

04:01.273 --> 04:04.074
I'D LIKE TO GIVE HIS BODY
A ONCE-OVER.

04:05.260 --> 04:06.728
I'M GUESSING
YOU WOULDN'T.

04:06.796 --> 04:08.930
ACTUALLY,
HE'S ON ANOTHER VACATION.

04:08.998 --> 04:11.249
SO, HOW CAN WE TAKE CARE
OF THIS?

04:11.316 --> 04:13.868
WELL, YOU CALL YOUR FRIENDLY,
QUALIFIED EXTERMINATOR

04:13.936 --> 04:16.704
TO KICK SOME BEDBUG ARSE.

04:16.772 --> 04:18.889
WHAT'S THAT GOING
TO COST US?

04:18.957 --> 04:21.459
LET'S SEE.
TWO FLOORS, THE BASEMENT.

04:21.527 --> 04:24.228
CARRY THE 2.
BOOM-BOOM-DIDDY-BOP...

04:24.296 --> 04:27.365
UH, YOU'RE LOOKING AT
ABOUT 11 HUNDRED.

04:27.432 --> 04:29.233
NO, I'M LOOKING
IN THE YELLOW PAGES

04:29.301 --> 04:30.734
UNDER "CHEAPER BUG GUY."

04:30.802 --> 04:32.653
DOUG.

04:33.889 --> 04:36.741
DOUG, HOW ARE WE GOING
TO GET RID OF THESE BUGS?

04:36.808 --> 04:39.477
WOULD YOU LET ME HANDLE IT?
I'LL HANDLE IT, OK?

04:39.545 --> 04:41.779
YEAH. WE'RE GOOD. THANKS.

04:41.847 --> 04:43.915
OK, WELL,
GOOD LUCK, FOLKS.

04:43.983 --> 04:45.316
SLEEP TIGHT AND...

04:45.384 --> 04:48.085
I THINK YOU KNOW
THE REST.

04:51.457 --> 04:53.824
IF WE SHARE A HOTEL ROOM,

04:53.892 --> 04:55.860
IT'S NOT GOING
TO COST YOU A CENT.

04:55.927 --> 04:56.911
LOOK, WE SPEND
A COUPLE HOURS

04:56.979 --> 04:58.512
ON THE DIG IN THE MORNING,

04:58.580 --> 05:01.099
THEN AFTER THAT,
IT'S A TOTAL PARTY SCENE.

05:01.166 --> 05:03.801
WE CAN GET
TOTALLY WASTED.

05:03.869 --> 05:06.770
MOM,
JUST THINK ABOUT IT, OK?

05:08.591 --> 05:10.942
NOW CAN WE GO TO VEGAS? NO.

05:11.010 --> 05:12.493
I WANT TO GO
TO THE AZTEC RUINS.

05:12.561 --> 05:14.361
WE GOT TO DECIDE THIS
SOMEHOW.

05:14.430 --> 05:16.163
ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS.

05:16.231 --> 05:18.032
NO, YOU ALWAYS
THROW LATE.

05:18.099 --> 05:21.669
<i>THAT'S HOW WE ENDED UP WITH
THOSE MAMA'S FAMILY DVDs.</i>

05:21.737 --> 05:24.338
HOW ABOUT WE PLAY
TRIVIAL PURSUIT?

05:24.406 --> 05:28.176
NO WAY.
YOU KNOW TOO MANY... THINGS.

05:28.244 --> 05:31.245
THAT'S LIKE ME SAYING,
LET'S WRESTLE FOR IT.

05:31.313 --> 05:32.246
OK.

05:32.314 --> 05:33.314
WHAT?

05:33.382 --> 05:35.734
LET'S WRESTLE FOR IT.

05:35.801 --> 05:37.268
FINE.

05:37.336 --> 05:38.536
GOOD.

05:41.139 --> 05:43.575
I'LL GIVE YOU
A COUPLE DAYS TO TRAIN.

05:50.449 --> 05:51.849
OK, BABY, LET'S GO.

05:51.917 --> 05:54.218
I GOT TO WAIT
FOR MY HOT POCKET.

05:54.286 --> 05:56.921
WHAT? HONEY, I JUST
SET OFF THE BUG BOMB.

05:56.989 --> 05:58.356
I SAID I WAS GOING
TO DO IT.

05:58.424 --> 05:59.591
HOW LONG WILL THAT TAKE?

05:59.658 --> 06:01.009
I GOT TWO MORE MINUTES.

06:01.076 --> 06:03.260
IN 30 SECONDS, THERE WILL
BE PESTICIDE EVERYWHERE.

06:03.328 --> 06:05.296
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO HAVE
A HOT POCKET NOW?

06:05.364 --> 06:06.464
I HAVE A PROBLEM, OK?

06:06.532 --> 06:09.166
NOW'S NOT THE TIME
TO REMIND ME.

06:09.234 --> 06:10.685
JUST HURRY UP,
ALL RIGHT, BABE?

06:30.305 --> 06:31.472
COME ON!

07:02.655 --> 07:03.788
SO, I JUST
GOT OFF THE PHONE

07:03.823 --> 07:04.956
WITH THE REPUBLIC MOTEL

07:05.024 --> 07:06.991
TO COMPLAIN THAT THEY
GAVE MY DAD BEDBUGS.

07:07.059 --> 07:08.325
TO APOLOGIZE,

07:08.393 --> 07:11.262
THEY'RE SENDING OVER VOUCHERS
FOR ONE WEEK'S FREE STAY.

07:11.329 --> 07:12.646
IDIOTS...

07:12.715 --> 07:14.415
THAT'S LIKE WHEN
I FOUND THE NASAL STRIP

07:14.482 --> 07:17.018
IN MY CHILI
AT THE DINER.

07:17.086 --> 07:20.121
THEY GAVE ME
TWO FREE BOWLS OF CHILI.

07:20.189 --> 07:23.090
ONLY DIFFERENCE IS WE'RE NOT
GOING TO THAT INFESTED MOTEL

07:23.158 --> 07:25.426
AND YOU ATE
ALL THAT CHILI.

07:25.493 --> 07:28.262
AND MOST OF
THE NASAL STRIP.

07:28.330 --> 07:31.232
AGAIN,
I THOUGHT IT WAS BACON.

07:31.350 --> 07:33.901
GOOD NIGHT, BABY.

07:33.969 --> 07:37.004
WHOA. AREN'T YOU, UH...

07:37.072 --> 07:38.606
FORGETTING SOMETHING?

07:38.674 --> 07:39.974
WHAT?

07:40.041 --> 07:41.509
HOW ABOUT A THANK YOU

07:41.577 --> 07:42.710
FOR SAVING US
11 HUNDRED BUCKS

07:42.778 --> 07:45.012
WITH MY BRILLIANT
BUG BOMB IDEA?

07:45.080 --> 07:47.848
OH, YEAH.
THANK YOU, BABY.

07:50.152 --> 07:54.221
WELL, THANK YOU
FOR ROCKING MY WORLD.

08:02.331 --> 08:04.165
DOUG,
I SAID NOT TONIGHT.

08:04.232 --> 08:05.533
WHAT?

08:05.601 --> 08:07.468
STOP TICKLING MY LEG.

08:07.536 --> 08:09.837
I'M NOWHERE NEAR YOU.

08:11.807 --> 08:14.542
AAAHHH... YUCK!

08:14.610 --> 08:16.277
THEY'RE BACK!

08:18.880 --> 08:22.183
YOU AND YOUR BRILLIANT
BUG BOMB IDEA!

08:22.250 --> 08:24.085
YOU HAD TO CHEAP-OUT,
RIGHT?

08:24.153 --> 08:26.887
IT WAS YOUR STINKING DAD WHO
BROUGHT THEM HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE.

08:26.955 --> 08:29.274
LIKE YOUR PARENTS
ARE SO CLEAN?

08:29.341 --> 08:32.743
THEY ARE.
YOU CAN EAT OFF MY PARENTS.

08:32.811 --> 08:35.363
OH, MY GOD.
ARE THEY IN MY HAIR?

08:35.431 --> 08:37.865
BY THE WAY, YOU'VE MADE YOUR
SHARE OF STUPID DECISIONS.

08:37.933 --> 08:39.700
I CAN THINK OF ONE
RIGHT NOW.

08:39.768 --> 08:41.302
OHH...

08:41.369 --> 08:44.505
SO, YOU WANT TO BE ALONE?
WELL, YOU GOT IT, SISTER,

08:44.572 --> 08:45.923
BECAUSE I AIN'T
SLEEPING HERE TONIGHT.

08:45.991 --> 08:46.924
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

08:46.992 --> 08:48.926
DEACON'S.
YEAH, SO SLEEP TIGHT.

08:48.994 --> 08:51.128
AND YOU KNOW THE REST!

09:01.139 --> 09:04.508
HEY, MAN.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

09:04.576 --> 09:07.128
CARRIE AND I ARE IN THE
MIDDLE OF THIS WHOLE THING,

09:07.196 --> 09:09.163
SO CAN I
CRASH ON YOUR COUCH?

09:09.231 --> 09:11.348
YEAH. WELL...

09:11.416 --> 09:13.100
TELL HIM NO.

09:13.168 --> 09:14.969
HERE'S THE THING.

09:15.037 --> 09:17.138
CARRIE CALLED
AND TOLD US ABOUT...

09:17.205 --> 09:18.338
YOUR PROBLEM.

09:18.406 --> 09:19.490
DAMN IT!

09:19.557 --> 09:22.493
LISTEN, MAN, I'M CLEAN! YOU
GOT TO BELIEVE ME! I'M CLEAN!

09:22.561 --> 09:24.745
HOLD ON.

09:26.965 --> 09:28.015
LET'S LET HIM STAY.

09:28.083 --> 09:29.751
I DON'T WANT HIM
NEAR THE KIDS.

09:29.818 --> 09:31.986
HE CAN TAKE HIS CLOTHES
OFF IN THE HALLWAY.

09:32.053 --> 09:35.155
YOU REALLY WANT HIM
DOING THAT?

09:35.223 --> 09:37.225
I CAN'T THROW HIM
OUT IN THE STREET.

09:37.292 --> 09:39.960
LOOK, HE SAYS HE'S CLEAN.

09:40.028 --> 09:41.495
LOOK.

10:01.900 --> 10:03.301
MORNING.

10:03.369 --> 10:04.085
MORNING.
MORNING.

10:12.510 --> 10:14.845
OH, LISA, THOSE ARE NICE
EARRINGS. ARE THEY NEW?

10:14.913 --> 10:16.797
PLEASE DON'T TOUCH ME.

10:18.066 --> 10:19.933
WHAT'S GOING ON?

10:20.001 --> 10:22.086
DID DOUG CALL YOU?

10:22.154 --> 10:23.571
NO.

10:23.638 --> 10:26.874
HE SENT A MASS E-MAIL.

10:30.829 --> 10:33.331
NO, FREDERICK. WE'LL
WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE.

10:33.398 --> 10:34.598
WHAT'S WRONG, GRANDMA?

10:34.666 --> 10:36.100
COME, FREDERICK.
NOW.

10:36.168 --> 10:39.320
KEEP WALKING, GRANDMAMA.

10:39.388 --> 10:40.555
THAT'S RIGHT, I GOT BEDBUGS.

10:40.622 --> 10:42.323
WHO WANTS SOME, HUH?
WHAT'S UP?

10:59.441 --> 11:00.908
HEY.
HEY.

11:00.976 --> 11:03.644
ALL RIGHT, HE'S HERE.
NOW WE CAN GET STARTED.

11:03.711 --> 11:05.713
GET STARTED WITH WHAT?

11:06.765 --> 11:11.551
I TOLD YOU GUYS I'M NOT
GIVING YOU A TANDEM MASSAGE.

11:11.619 --> 11:13.488
NO, NO, NO-
WE STILL CAN'T DECIDE

11:13.555 --> 11:14.956
WHERE TO GO ON VACATION,

11:15.023 --> 11:15.990
SO WE'RE WRESTLING
FOR IT.

11:16.057 --> 11:17.658
WE NEED YOU TO REF.

11:17.726 --> 11:19.310
I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT WRESTLING.

11:19.378 --> 11:21.128
CALL "MATCH"
WHEN YOU SEE

11:21.196 --> 11:22.496
ONE OF US
PIN THE OTHER.

11:22.563 --> 11:23.964
AND MAKE SURE
THERE'S NO ILLEGAL STUFF

11:24.032 --> 11:26.433
LIKE LOW-BLOWS
OR EYE-GOUGING,

11:26.501 --> 11:27.434
ALL RIGHT?

11:35.160 --> 11:38.863
CAN I GOUGE
MY OWN EYES OUT?

11:38.931 --> 11:41.481
ALL-RIGHTY,
LET'S DO THIS!

11:41.549 --> 11:46.486
YOU ARE IN FOR A GRECO-ROMAN
POUNDING, MY FRIEND.

12:02.855 --> 12:05.389
YOU GUYS
GOT ANYTHING TO EAT?

12:06.274 --> 12:08.726
YEAH,
LEFTOVER CHINESE.

12:08.794 --> 12:11.261
SECOND SHELF,
TOWARDS THE BACK.

12:11.329 --> 12:14.348
SODA'S IN THE DOOR.

12:18.554 --> 12:20.454
MMM.

12:23.392 --> 12:26.227
YOU KNOW,
THIS MU SHU'S REALLY GOOD.

12:26.294 --> 12:27.294
WHERE DID YOU GET IT FROM?

12:27.362 --> 12:28.963
SZECHUAN VILLAGE.

12:29.030 --> 12:30.264
MMM.

12:30.332 --> 12:32.650
I GOT TO REMEMBER THAT.

12:32.717 --> 12:35.686
WHERE ARE YOU GUYS AT,
WRESTLING-WISE?

12:35.754 --> 12:40.007
I'M ABOUT TO MAKE MY MOVE RIGHT NOW.

12:40.075 --> 12:44.412
YEAH. THAT'S IF YOUR MOVE
IS TO SUBMIT TO ME.

12:44.479 --> 12:47.481
THAT'S IT. PIN!

12:47.549 --> 12:49.750
IT'S MY KIDS' BEDTIME.

12:49.818 --> 12:51.251
I'LL CHECK ON YOU GUYS
TOMORROW.

12:51.319 --> 12:52.587
COME ON, MAN.
YOU CAN'T GO.

12:52.654 --> 12:54.088
WE NEED A REF.

12:54.155 --> 12:56.290
OTHERWISE,
THIS DOESN'T LOOK RIGHT.

12:59.711 --> 13:02.079
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

13:02.147 --> 13:03.931
I BUG-BOMBED
THE WHOLE HOUSE.

13:03.999 --> 13:05.733
BUG-BOMBED?

13:06.535 --> 13:09.453
THAT'S LIKE THE WORST THING
YOU CAN DO.

13:09.521 --> 13:12.957
ALL THAT STUFF DOES
IS MAKE THEM HORNY.

13:15.961 --> 13:19.313
I SHOULD HAVE USED
SOME OF THAT ON HER, HUH?

13:22.250 --> 13:24.618
YOU CAN STILL GET RID OF THEM, RIGHT?

13:24.685 --> 13:26.853
OH, YEAH. DON'T WORRY.

13:26.922 --> 13:29.056
I'VE GOT A VERY SPECIAL
PESTICIDE

13:29.124 --> 13:31.158
FOR INFESTATIONS
LIKE THIS.

13:31.226 --> 13:32.826
I CAN'T TELL YOU
ITS NAME,

13:32.894 --> 13:36.347
BUT YOU CAN ONLY GET IT
IN KOREA.

13:37.532 --> 13:39.634
SO, IT'S 11 HUNDRED,
RIGHT?

13:39.701 --> 13:41.201
OH, GOD, NO.

13:41.270 --> 13:44.138
THAT WAS BEFORE YOU ORGANIZED
THIS LITTLE LOVE-IN HERE.

13:44.205 --> 13:47.891
NO, UH... IT'S GOING TO
BE AT LEAST 25 HUNDRED.

13:47.959 --> 13:48.993
25 HUNDRED?

13:49.061 --> 13:50.061
I WANT YOU TO KILL THEM,

13:50.128 --> 13:52.196
NOT SEND THEM
TO PRIVATE SCHOOL.

13:52.264 --> 13:54.031
OK, STOP.

13:54.099 --> 13:56.466
WE WILL PAY IT,
ALL RIGHT?

13:56.534 --> 13:58.736
JUST GET
RID OF THEM.

13:58.804 --> 14:00.437
HOW LONG IS IT GOING
TO TAKE?

14:00.505 --> 14:03.574
WELL, IF I GET STARTED
RIGHT AWAY

14:03.641 --> 14:05.176
AND WORK ALL NIGHT-

14:06.260 --> 14:08.295
UH...

14:08.363 --> 14:10.898
I COULD PROBABLY HAVE YOU
BUG FREE BY THE MORNING.

14:10.966 --> 14:14.268
SO, WE GOT TO SLEEP
DOWNSTAIRS, HUH?

14:14.336 --> 14:16.753
NOT UNLESS YOU HAVE
A PROTECTIVE BUBBLE.

14:16.821 --> 14:18.722
AND IF YOU'RE BLINKING
AT 25 HUNDRED,

14:18.790 --> 14:19.991
I'M GUESSING YOU DON'T.

14:21.910 --> 14:24.645
I'LL LET YOU TWO PACK.

14:26.815 --> 14:28.532
WHERE ARE WE GOING TO GO?

14:28.600 --> 14:30.867
I GUESS WE COULD
STAY AT A HOTEL.

14:30.935 --> 14:32.803
WHAT'S $200 MORE
ON YOUR BILL.

14:32.870 --> 14:34.938
I DON'T HAVE TO STAY
IN A HOTEL.

14:35.006 --> 14:36.290
I DON'T HAVE TO STAY
IN A HOTEL, EITHER.

14:36.358 --> 14:37.658
SO, WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST?

14:39.027 --> 14:40.494
WELL,
MY DAD ALWAYS SAID,

14:40.562 --> 14:42.996
IF I MARRIED YOU I'D
WIND UP SLEEPING IN A CAR,

14:43.064 --> 14:45.132
AND...

14:45.200 --> 14:48.952
SO, YOU, UH...

14:49.020 --> 14:50.654
YOU WANT TO, UH...

14:50.721 --> 14:52.689
OH, MY GOD. YOU'RE KIDDING ME, RIGHT?

14:52.757 --> 14:54.524
I DON'T KNOW.

14:54.592 --> 14:56.126
WHEN THIS JEEP'S
A- ROCKIN',

14:56.194 --> 14:58.095
DO NOT COME KNOCKIN'.

14:58.163 --> 15:00.064
ALL RIGHT.
GOOD NIGHT, HON.

15:04.886 --> 15:08.422
THERE'S A MAN
STARING AT US.

15:08.490 --> 15:12.626
OOH. GOOD CALL ON
THE NOT GETTING NAKED.

15:12.694 --> 15:14.562
HEY.

15:14.629 --> 15:17.732
WOW.
LOOKS PRETTY ROOMY.

15:17.799 --> 15:19.066
DO I KNOW YOU?

15:19.133 --> 15:21.969
OH, SORRY.
I'M PHIL HAUSER.

15:22.036 --> 15:23.203
I LIVE
DOWN THE STREET.

15:25.056 --> 15:25.739
ALL RIGHT.

15:25.807 --> 15:26.890
MY DAUGHTER EMILY
SOLD YOU

15:26.958 --> 15:29.426
ALL THOSE GIRL SCOUT COOKIES LAST YEAR.

15:29.494 --> 15:31.161
YOU BOUGHT
SO MANY THIN MINTS,

15:31.229 --> 15:34.398
TO WHOLE TROOP WAS ABLE
TO GO TO BUSCH GARDENS.

15:34.466 --> 15:36.200
THAT'S GREAT.
YOU KNOW-

15:36.267 --> 15:38.935
I NEVER GOT
MY COCONUT CLUSTERS.

15:39.004 --> 15:41.338
WELL, THAT'S NOT OK.

15:41.406 --> 15:44.841
GIVE ME YOUR NUMBER.
I'LL GET BACK TO YOU.

15:44.909 --> 15:46.494
YOU HAVE A PEN?

15:46.561 --> 15:48.595
UM... NO, SORRY.

15:48.663 --> 15:50.114
I'VE GOT ONE
IN THE GLOVE COMPARTMENT.

15:50.181 --> 15:51.781
STOP... STOP!

15:51.849 --> 15:53.083
WHAT?

15:53.151 --> 15:54.418
YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:54.486 --> 15:56.620
WE ARE IN OUR BEDROOM
RIGHT NOW, OK?

15:56.687 --> 15:58.622
DO WE COME TO YOUR BEDROOM
TALKING COOKIES?

15:58.689 --> 16:00.690
NO, WE DON'T.

16:01.926 --> 16:04.828
FINISH UP YOUR BUSINESS,
SNOWFLAKE.

16:04.896 --> 16:07.097
WE'RE GOING.

16:07.165 --> 16:09.333
GREAT.

16:09.401 --> 16:10.834
YOU WANT TO KNOW
THE CHANCES

16:10.902 --> 16:12.670
OF ME SEEING
THOSE COCONUT CLUSTERS?

16:12.737 --> 16:14.104
GOOSE EGG.

16:15.173 --> 16:16.507
ALL RIGHT,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:16.575 --> 16:18.075
MY BACK IS KILLING ME,

16:18.142 --> 16:19.142
PEOPLE ARE STARING AT US,

16:19.211 --> 16:20.211
WE'LL NEVER
GET TO SLEEP HERE.

16:20.278 --> 16:21.579
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

16:21.646 --> 16:24.147
LET'S JUST GO SOMEPLACE TO
KILL SOME TIME UNTIL MORNING.

16:24.216 --> 16:26.750
FINE... OH, BOY.

16:26.818 --> 16:27.751
WHAT?

16:27.819 --> 16:29.086
DON'T PANIC,

16:29.153 --> 16:32.356
BUT I THINK PETE'S SPRAYING
THE LIVING ROOM IN YOUR BRA.

17:29.898 --> 17:31.031
LOOK AT THIS.

17:31.099 --> 17:34.434
DRINKING,
STAYING OUT ALL NIGHT-

17:34.502 --> 17:36.770
REALLY TAKES ME BACK TO
MY JUNIOR COLLEGE DAYS.

17:36.838 --> 17:41.041
OH, YEAH?
ALL 12 OF THEM?

17:41.109 --> 17:42.776
12 MORE THAN YOU.

17:42.844 --> 17:44.578
JUST SHUT UP. GET ME
SOME MORE PEANUTS, PLEASE.

17:44.645 --> 17:46.914
CAN WE GET
SOME MORE PEANUTS?

17:46.981 --> 17:48.315
HELLO!

17:48.382 --> 17:51.251
CAN'T YOU SEE THE MAN
IS BUSY DOING SCRATCH-OFFS?

17:51.319 --> 17:53.153
HERE, TAKE MINE.
THANK YOU.

17:53.221 --> 17:56.223
I'M MIKE,
AND THAT'S MY WIFE NANCY.

17:56.290 --> 17:57.557
OH, HEY.
DOUG AND CARRIE.

17:57.625 --> 17:59.860
YOU GUYS LOOK LIKE
YOU'VE HAD A WILD NIGHT.

17:59.928 --> 18:01.245
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN US
AN HOUR AGO.

18:01.312 --> 18:04.882
WE REALLY RAISED THE ROOF
AT RITE-AID, RIGHT, BABE?

18:04.949 --> 18:07.567
I HOPE THAT BLOOD PRESSURE
MACHINE WASN'T ACCURATE,

18:07.635 --> 18:11.272
BECAUSE IF IT WAS
I GOT TO MAKE A CALL.

18:11.339 --> 18:14.074
ANYWAY, WE'RE
JUST KILLING SOME TIME.

18:14.142 --> 18:15.910
WE'RE GETTING SOME
WORK DONE ON OUR HOUSE.

18:15.977 --> 18:17.778
OH, I HEAR THAT.

18:17.845 --> 18:20.047
WE JUST PUT A HOT TUB
IN OUR BACKYARD.

18:20.115 --> 18:21.181
TOOK FOREVER.

18:21.249 --> 18:22.883
BUT IT WAS WORTH IT.

18:22.951 --> 18:24.818
OH, YEAH.

18:24.886 --> 18:27.705
LAST CALL!
CLOSING TIME!

18:27.772 --> 18:30.106
IT WAS NICE
MEETING YOU GUYS.

18:30.174 --> 18:32.909
LISTEN, NO REASON THE
NIGHT HAS TO END HERE.

18:32.977 --> 18:34.711
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

18:34.779 --> 18:36.396
WHY DON'T YOU GUYS
COME

18:36.464 --> 18:37.931
AND HANG OUT
AT OUR PLACE?

18:37.998 --> 18:41.000
I'LL OPEN A BOTTLE OF WINE,
GET THE HOT TUB GOING-

18:41.068 --> 18:42.336
I'M JUST SAYING-

18:42.403 --> 18:44.238
I THINK THE FOUR OF US

18:44.305 --> 18:46.840
COULD HAVE
A PRETTY GOOD TIME.

18:53.148 --> 18:55.249
I DON'T KNOW.

18:55.317 --> 18:58.168
WELL, THINK ABOUT IT.

18:58.236 --> 19:00.470
I'M GOING TO TAKE CARE
OF OUR TAB.

19:03.341 --> 19:06.509
WELL, LET'S GO, BABY.
COME ON.

19:08.612 --> 19:10.164
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

19:10.231 --> 19:13.066
WHAT?
DOUG, THEY HAVE A HOUSE.

19:13.134 --> 19:15.869
AND WHERE I COME FROM,
THAT'S BETTER THAN A JEEP.

19:15.937 --> 19:19.523
CARRIE, I'M PRETTY SURE
THEY WANT TO SWING WITH US.

19:19.591 --> 19:21.775
SO WHAT?
WE GET IN THE HOT TUB,

19:21.843 --> 19:23.577
AND THEN WE GO-UGH-

19:23.644 --> 19:25.779
WE'RE TOO TIRED
TO SWING TONIGHT,

19:25.847 --> 19:28.215
AND THEN WE'RE IN THEIR
GUEST BEDROOM, NO BIG DEAL.

19:28.283 --> 19:29.800
IT'S NEVER GOING TO WORK.

19:29.867 --> 19:31.735
DID YOU SEE THE WAY
SHE WAS EYE-BALLING ME?

19:31.803 --> 19:34.438
SHE WANTS THIS!

19:36.424 --> 19:37.458
YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:37.525 --> 19:39.526
I AM WILLING TO ROLL
THE DICE ON THAT ONE.

19:39.594 --> 19:40.794
OK, LET'S GO.

19:40.862 --> 19:41.662
COME ON.

19:41.729 --> 19:44.147
GREAT.
WITH ALL YOUR WHINING,

19:44.215 --> 19:46.883
THEY CLOSED THE DEAL
WITH ANOTHER COUPLE NOW!

19:46.951 --> 19:49.353
WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?

19:49.420 --> 19:51.721
YOU KNOW WHAT, BABY?
YOU'RE RIGHT.

19:51.789 --> 19:53.290
I NEED TO SLEEP.

19:53.358 --> 19:54.557
I'M JUST
SICK OF YOU RIGHT NOW.

19:54.625 --> 19:56.426
I'M SO SICK OF YOU, TOO.

19:56.494 --> 19:58.495
WHY DON'T I CALL PETE,

19:58.562 --> 20:00.230
THE BUG GUY,
AND SEE IF HE'S DONE.

20:00.298 --> 20:02.032
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

20:04.218 --> 20:06.419
HEY, PETE, HI, IT'S CARRIE.

20:06.488 --> 20:08.288
ARE YOU DONE YET?

20:08.356 --> 20:10.657
WHAT?

20:10.725 --> 20:13.193
HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE YOU
TO FIND THE QUEEN?

20:14.595 --> 20:16.596
OH, MY-OK-GOOD-BYE.

20:16.664 --> 20:18.464
HE SAID IT'S GOING TO BE
ANOTHER 3 DAYS.

20:18.532 --> 20:20.734
3 DAYS!

20:20.801 --> 20:23.270
NOW WE GOT TO PAY
MORE MONEY FOR A HOTEL!

20:23.338 --> 20:24.154
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

20:24.222 --> 20:26.072
WE HAVE
THOSE FREE VOUCHERS

20:26.140 --> 20:27.974
FOR THE MOTEL
MY DAD STAYED AT.

20:28.042 --> 20:31.778
IF YOU WANT TO DRIVE
TO FLORIDA.

20:31.846 --> 20:33.813
I DON'T...

20:33.881 --> 20:35.649
BUT I KNOW SOMEONE
WHO WILL.

20:35.716 --> 20:37.951
HOW GREAT
DID THIS WORK OUT?

20:38.019 --> 20:39.252
YOU GOT TO GAMBLE,

20:39.320 --> 20:41.855
I GOT TO EXCAVATE
A NATIVE AMERICAN CAMPGROUND.

20:41.923 --> 20:43.256
EVERYBODY WINS.

20:43.324 --> 20:46.059
YEAH, WE REALLY HAVE DOUG AND
CARRIE TO THANK FOR THIS ONE.

20:46.127 --> 20:47.628
WE SURE DO.

21:07.998 --> 21:09.666
THIS IS ACTUALLY
PRETTY NICE.

21:09.734 --> 21:10.801
YEAH.

21:13.621 --> 21:16.507
HEY, WHAT DO YOU THINK
THEY DO WITH THOSE MATS?

21:16.574 --> 21:20.911
I DON'T KNOW, BUT DON'T
WALK ON THEM BAREFOOT.
