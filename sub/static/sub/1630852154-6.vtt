- This is fantastic. What I
love most about this table

is that it's from Eddy's
Bakery,

01:42.000 --> 01:44.333

but it's a classic iconic place

01:44.467 --> 01:47.000

by just people interacting

we said $500 bucks,

- $500 bucks?

02:03.767 --> 02:05.967
No way. $4,500.

02:06.100 --> 02:08.266
$4,500 for this?

02:08.400 --> 02:11.133
- For a table like this,
$4,500 bucks, that's a steal.

at tables like this?

this.
- For how much?

02:27.000 --> 02:28.633
- Well, you can get them
in a wide range.

02:28.767 --> 02:31.066

top, not the age.

to figure out what to do there.

03:56.800 --> 03:58.734
- Rent it out.
- I've got a different idea.

03:58.867 --> 04:01.033
- What's that?

04:01.166 --> 04:03.133
- Well, I've always wanted to
go into business

04:03.266 --> 04:05.767
and I think this is
the opportunity.

04:05.900 --> 04:08.000
I'm going to do my own store
there.

04:08.133 --> 04:09.533
- You're going to sell candy?

04:09.667 --> 04:11.567
- Yes. It's right on
the highway,

04:11.700 --> 04:13.767
it's a proven business.
This is my future.

04:13.900 --> 04:15.767
If I don't do it, I'm going to
regret it.

04:15.900 --> 04:18.533
I bought this building years
ago. For a long time,

04:18.667 --> 04:20.800
it's been paying me back
in the form of rent.

04:20.934 --> 04:22.667
But now that the candy shop
moved out,

04:22.800 --> 04:25.500
I see an opportunity here
and I have to take it.

04:26.900 --> 04:29.467
So that property on the
highway, 25 years ago,

04:29.600 --> 04:31.467
bought that place.
So I thought,

04:31.600 --> 04:33.467
maybe one day, there'd be
a business there.

04:33.600 --> 04:35.200
And my brother and I had this
ideas if we said,

04:35.333 --> 04:37.700
why don't we start with a mini
putt. So we built a mini-putt.

04:37.834 --> 04:40.533
And it was like making $100
bucks a week.

04:40.667 --> 04:42.133
So that was not the best idea.

04:42.266 --> 04:44.900
And I thought, maybe I'll start
a chip truck.

04:45.033 --> 04:46.800
Put it all together,
had a big chip truck there,

04:46.934 --> 04:49.533
but nobody came.
And Rita came to me.

04:49.667 --> 04:52.667
So she did a candy store there
for 17 years and she did well.

04:52.800 --> 04:55.233
She can't do it anymore.
She's stretched out too thin.

04:55.367 --> 04:57.900
So I said, what can I do here?

04:58.033 --> 05:00.834
To me, it was a no-brainer.
I had to go candy store.

05:00.967 --> 05:03.800
And with all the failures
that happened through me,

05:03.934 --> 05:06.000
I think this is the winner.

05:06.133 --> 05:07.800
I've got to gotta get up there

05:07.934 --> 05:10.066

05:10.200 --> 05:12.300

08:22.967 --> 08:25.066
Pretty cool piece, eh?
- Say cheese.

08:25.200 --> 08:26.967

08:27.100 --> 08:30.233
Ron: You don't come across a,
an 8-track player every day.

08:31.767 --> 08:34.800
- I love these.
- Those C-cans are deep.

08:34.934 --> 08:37.033
Maya: We have a lot to do,
guys.

08:39.333 --> 08:41.633
Narrator: Ted and Brandon head
out to their salvage job,

08:41.767 --> 08:44.233
a mobile home in the village
of Proton Station.

08:45.367 --> 08:48.533
Ted: Justin needs a change. But
I'll give him like a week max,

08:48.667 --> 08:50.734
trying to sell candy to kids.

08:50.867 --> 08:52.600
Brandon: Maybe he'll just get
the itch to come back

08:52.734 --> 08:54.166
to the machine.
Ted: I hope so.

08:54.300 --> 08:56.200
There's the place there. I'm
going to have to back down.

08:56.333 --> 08:57.967
Brandon: Oh, it's this house
here?

08:58.100 --> 08:59.600
Ted: Yeah. Look at it.
Seen better days.

08:59.734 --> 09:01.967
I'll tell you something, we're
not getting any architectural

09:02.100 --> 09:03.567
features out of here.

09:03.700 --> 09:05.800
Looking at this place
from the outside,

09:05.934 --> 09:08.233
I have no idea why Vicky
would send us here.

09:08.367 --> 09:10.266
Brandon: What are we taking
from this place?

09:10.400 --> 09:12.100
Ted: I don't know.

09:12.233 --> 09:14.600
There's a nice toboggan.
Right there.

09:14.734 --> 09:16.567
There's something.

09:18.266 --> 09:19.834
High security.

09:21.233 --> 09:22.767
- Let's do it.

09:22.900 --> 09:25.233
Ted: Oh, it's full of stuff.

09:25.367 --> 09:27.000
There's a lot of stuff here.

09:27.133 --> 09:28.600
(Laughs)

09:28.734 --> 09:30.266
They didn't throw away
anything.

09:30.400 --> 09:32.200
We walk in and now I get it.

09:32.333 --> 09:35.367
This place may be small
but it is packed full.

09:35.500 --> 09:37.233
Brandon: Oh, it's filled.
Boxes everywhere.

09:37.367 --> 09:39.333
- Look it, the kitchen's full.

09:39.467 --> 09:41.467
This is going to be a bigger
job than I thought.

09:41.600 --> 09:43.133
I hope the team's clearing
out the C-can,

09:43.266 --> 09:46.066
we've got a lot of stuff coming
back. Now I'm glad we brought

09:46.200 --> 09:48.066
the trailer, I just, see--
- We're going to need trailer.

09:48.200 --> 09:49.500
- always bring the trailer,
man.

09:49.633 --> 09:51.266
Brandon: Yeah.

09:56.467 --> 09:58.367
though.

09:58.500 --> 10:00.166
Brandon: Oh, it's filled.
Boxes everywhere.

10:00.300 --> 10:01.700
Ted: Look it,
the kitchen's full.

10:01.834 --> 10:03.333
They didn't throw away anything.

10:03.467 --> 10:04.967
Now I'm glad we brought
the trailer. Just, see...

10:05.100 --> 10:06.467
- We're going to need
the trailer.

10:06.600 --> 10:08.133
always bring the trailer, man.
- Yeah.

10:08.266 --> 10:10.467
- We'll find stuff here. This
is a place to look for toys,

10:10.600 --> 10:13.133
games. Collectible stuff.
- Collectibles.

10:13.266 --> 10:15.100
- So there could be something
here 30, 40 years ago

10:15.233 --> 10:16.533
and they just shoved it aside.

10:16.667 --> 10:18.700
- Yeah, and it could be worth
something now.

10:18.834 --> 10:20.233
Ted: Yeah. There's a nice wood
stove.

10:20.367 --> 10:21.900
Gloves on here,
you got your gloves on?

10:22.033 --> 10:23.467
- Yeah, I've got my gloves on.

10:23.600 --> 10:25.300
Ted: In a place like this,
you are not gonna find

10:25.433 --> 10:28.367
super valuable antiques
but you may find some

10:28.500 --> 10:30.133
pop culture items.

10:30.266 --> 10:31.900
Look it, right away.
- Well, you've got--

10:32.033 --> 10:34.567
- That's cast, very cool, eh?
- Is it a dog?

10:34.700 --> 10:36.767
- Yeah, it's cast iron though,
it's vintage.

10:36.900 --> 10:39.200
- Oh, nice.
- That's $100 bucks easy,

10:39.333 --> 10:40.500
right there.
- This is $100?

10:40.633 --> 10:43.533
- Yeah. If there's more in
here.

10:43.667 --> 10:45.633
- Hopefully there's a whole,
whole pound of them over here.

10:45.767 --> 10:47.667
- Okay, this is my box, you go
find your own, alright?

10:47.800 --> 10:49.667
- What, I was coming to see--
- No, you don't,

10:49.800 --> 10:51.667
you don't need two people to go
through the box.

10:51.800 --> 10:55.967
It's got some age. We'll just
take the whole box.

good. Oil lamps.

This is very cool,
this is an old butter churn.

11:08.066 --> 11:10.533

11:15.667 --> 11:17.633
Oh, these are cool.
Brandon: What have you got?

11:19.033 --> 11:21.166
- Those I know were hot when my
kids were young.

11:21.300 --> 11:23.367
They were pogs or something.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

11:23.500 --> 11:25.700
Ted: Yeah. So, but these I
think are older.

11:25.834 --> 11:28.166
These are older. If they're
worth a buck a piece,

11:28.300 --> 11:30.100
there's over 100 of them
in there.

11:30.233 --> 11:31.633
The collectible market
goes in cycles.

11:31.767 --> 11:33.967
When people are young,
they play with things.

11:34.100 --> 11:36.367
When they grow up,
they want to own them again

11:36.500 --> 11:38.633
and that's when they become
valuable.

11:38.767 --> 11:41.300
Fish and seafood recipes,
we can give that to Justin.

11:41.433 --> 11:43.066
Maybe that'll make him stay.

11:45.967 --> 11:47.633
Brandon, give me a hand
for a sec.

11:47.767 --> 11:49.500
- Think we can get it out of
there.

11:50.834 --> 11:52.767
- Oh, that's how they
got it in, eh?

11:52.900 --> 11:54.633
Knitting needles.

11:54.767 --> 11:56.967
- Hold on, there's an old
Playstation in here.

11:58.200 --> 11:59.567
- Could be worth some money,
eh?

11:59.700 --> 12:01.367
- It's definitely worth some
money.

12:01.500 --> 12:02.834
- Yeah? No box or anything,
just like that?

12:02.967 --> 12:04.834
- Yeah, these are collectable.
Someone would buy this.

12:04.967 --> 12:06.700
100 percent. If we could find
some games for it,

12:06.834 --> 12:09.700
that would be great.
- I know this stuff's
collectable

12:09.834 --> 12:11.600
for people your age, right?
- Well, anybody,

12:11.734 --> 12:13.300
anybody who's into video games.

12:13.433 --> 12:15.100
- Well, not anybody. Sorry.
- Well, you're not in
videogames.

12:15.233 --> 12:16.700
Let's just put it back
in the box here.

12:16.834 --> 12:19.033
- Okay. Just like people my age
are into vintage cars, right,

12:19.166 --> 12:21.166
muscle cars? And you guys
aren't.
- Exactly.

12:21.300 --> 12:22.600
- One of the things
I've learned from Ted

12:22.734 --> 12:24.567
is you don't judge a book by
its cover.

12:24.700 --> 12:26.433
Like there's stuff everywhere
we look in every room.

12:26.567 --> 12:28.433
I wasn't sure we were going to
find anything.

12:28.567 --> 12:31.233
- Hey Brandon! There's some
like video games in here. Huh?

12:31.367 --> 12:34.100
- Yeah, these, these, you can
play these on the Playstation,

12:34.233 --> 12:36.433
Ted. Oh, Ted.
- What's that?

12:36.567 --> 12:39.266
- It's a PS2. Someone would
still want this,

12:39.400 --> 12:41.367
if we had all the cords
and it was a complete set.

12:41.500 --> 12:43.500
- There's cords all around,
look at all this.

12:43.633 --> 12:44.934
- They're everywhere.
- Is this all games?

12:45.066 --> 12:47.100
- It does look like all games.
- Good thing Brandon's here

12:47.233 --> 12:49.133
because I know a lot
about a lot

12:49.266 --> 12:51.000
but I know squat about video
games.

12:51.133 --> 12:52.700
I'm relying on him for this.

12:52.834 --> 12:55.033
Brandon: Oh, is this Digimon?
Ted: Digimon cards.

12:55.166 --> 12:56.467
Brandon: What?
Ted: Aren't they worth money?

12:56.600 --> 12:59.367
- I'm not sure. If they were
Pokemon, 100 percent.

12:59.500 --> 13:01.767
Ted: Well, I'm taking them
anyhow,

13:01.900 --> 13:03.767
because they're some sort of
'mon'. It's not bad now, eh?

13:03.900 --> 13:06.033
- No, no we're doing, we're
doing really good right now.

13:06.166 --> 13:09.333
- Hey. What is that, Superman?
- Yeah, there's some comics
here.

13:09.467 --> 13:12.400
A whole bunch of comics.
Twelve cents.

13:12.533 --> 13:14.433
Ted: Well, that's good.
Brandon: Yeah.

13:14.567 --> 13:16.200
Ted: Yeah, look at that,
Wolverine. What's that?

13:18.467 --> 13:22.367
Wolverine, volume one,
number one. September 1982.

13:22.500 --> 13:24.066
It's in pretty good shape,
actually.

13:24.200 --> 13:26.100

scarcity are everything

13:26.233 --> 13:27.767

13:27.900 --> 13:30.233
Action Comics number one,
published in 1938,

13:30.367 --> 13:32.300
was the first appearance
of Superman

13:32.433 --> 13:34.533
and is the most valuable
comic book in the world.

13:34.667 --> 13:37.633
There are thought to be fewer
than 100 copies in existence

13:37.767 --> 13:41.066

as $3.2 million at auction.

25:02.367 --> 25:04.066
Oh, look at this.

25:04.200 --> 25:06.066
It's got some age.

25:06.200 --> 25:07.834
There's some good stuff here,
man.

25:07.967 --> 25:11.266
- NHL players album, 1966.
- What?

25:13.333 --> 25:15.333
- Look at this.

25:15.467 --> 25:17.667
- Dave Dryen, Stan Makita.
Don...

25:17.800 --> 25:20.100
I know all these guys.
Oh, that's beauty, man.

25:21.533 --> 25:24.600
Narrator: The 1966,
Coca-Cola hockey card series

25:24.734 --> 25:27.600
was a smart promo campaign
from the soft drink giant

25:27.734 --> 25:29.900
to get fans to drink a lot
of product

25:30.033 --> 25:32.433
in order to collect specially
marked bottle caps.

25:33.500 --> 25:35.266
The caps could be traded in
for the cards

25:35.400 --> 25:37.233
and this set included greats

25:37.367 --> 25:40.000
like Bobby Hull
and Gordie Howe.

25:40.133 --> 25:42.166
They are unique in the sports
card world

25:42.300 --> 25:44.467
and highly collectible.

25:46.266 --> 25:48.567
Ted: Look it, they're like
collector coins.

25:48.700 --> 25:50.600
Brandon: They look super old.

25:50.734 --> 25:52.834
Ted: They're cool though, eh?
- Yeah, they're really cool.

25:52.967 --> 25:54.600
- Okay, we're getting good
stuff now.

25:54.734 --> 25:56.667
- Here's a metal tin with
something in it.

25:56.800 --> 25:59.734
- Let's see? Turquoise ring.
- A couple pins.

25:59.867 --> 26:02.767
A couple earrings.
Ted: This is good stuff, man.

26:02.900 --> 26:05.433
Justin: Ted!
- Yeah, up here.

26:07.367 --> 26:09.066
- Isn't this better than
selling candy?

26:09.200 --> 26:11.400
- I've been doing this for 20
years, this is in my blood.

26:11.533 --> 26:13.266
- Candy's not in your blood.
Oh, well,

26:13.400 --> 26:15.467
except for what you eat.
- I'm a bit of an expert.

26:15.600 --> 26:17.500
- You've got sugar in
the bloodstream but...

26:19.266 --> 26:22.400
- For you.
- Thanks pal.
- You're welcome.

26:23.467 --> 26:25.533
Ted: There's like a whole box
of dolls here.

26:25.667 --> 26:27.567
- Those are creepy dolls.
- It's just all creepy dolls.

26:27.700 --> 26:29.000
- There's scary looking ones
here.

26:29.133 --> 26:30.734
Brandon: Some of them have no
arms or legs

26:30.867 --> 26:32.533
in that box over there.
Ted: This one's got no eyes.

26:32.667 --> 26:34.066
- Mama.

26:34.200 --> 26:36.667
Ted: There is a market for old
dolls but not these.

26:36.800 --> 26:38.834
They're broken, dirty
and creepy.

26:39.934 --> 26:41.867
I'm going to go check that
maintenance room.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.433
Let's go take a look at that
building next door first,
alright?

26:44.567 --> 26:45.900
Justin: Okay.

26:46.033 --> 26:48.066
Ted: I feel a little bit bad
dragging Justin up here,

26:48.200 --> 26:49.767
but I want him to stick
with us.

26:49.900 --> 26:54.100
So if we find something good,
maybe he'll be hooked.

26:54.233 --> 26:56.667
There is a newer addition on
the side of the building,

26:56.800 --> 26:59.900
hopefully it's holding some
good salvage.

27:02.100 --> 27:04.066
It's a bit of a letdown so far.

27:04.200 --> 27:06.333
- This place is huge. I can see
why Ted wanted me here

27:06.467 --> 27:08.166
but this place is a bust.

27:08.300 --> 27:10.066
- I'll go in the maintenance
room and check that out,

27:10.200 --> 27:12.066
alright?
- Nice timber here though.

27:12.200 --> 27:13.934
- I know, there's nice wood
here.

27:14.066 --> 27:16.800
This place is pretty grim.
But we're here now,

27:16.934 --> 27:19.266
time to look in every nook
and cranny.

27:19.400 --> 27:21.066
I've got to find something.

27:21.200 --> 27:22.867
I love a good crawlspace.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.066
It's dry up there too.

27:27.600 --> 27:30.000
Oh, there's a bunch of stuff up
here.

27:30.133 --> 27:32.600
What's this, man? Haha.

27:34.333 --> 27:36.500
What the hell is this? Swords.

27:36.633 --> 27:38.400
Justin, come here!

27:39.467 --> 27:42.633
Justin: What did you find?
- We can have a duel. Swords.

27:42.767 --> 27:45.333
- Come on.
- Yeah. Fencing.

27:45.467 --> 27:47.367
Give me one and I'll show you
how it works.

27:47.500 --> 27:49.700
- Here, I'll give you this one.
- Why?

27:49.834 --> 27:52.934

on it. Let's see.

hey,

27:55.300 --> 27:56.934
you've got the higher ground!
Stop it!

27:57.066 --> 27:58.934
You've got the higher ground!
You're cheating.

27:59.066 --> 28:00.667
- Pick it up, man.
You're--

28:00.800 --> 28:02.400
I'm going to whip you right on
the (beep) kneecap.

28:02.533 --> 28:04.133
Okay. Okay.
- What are you guys doing?

28:04.266 --> 28:05.667
- Nothing.
- Fencing.

28:05.800 --> 28:07.233
- Working.
- Fencing.

28:07.367 --> 28:10.200
- You're really having sword
fights in here. Geez.

28:10.333 --> 28:12.333
Ted: Oh here, man, what's this?

28:13.367 --> 28:14.700
Justin: What have you got up
there?

28:14.834 --> 28:17.800
Ted: It's an old trunk.
Holy crap, it's full.

28:22.066 --> 28:24.333
Ted: It's full of stuff. Wow.
Brandon: Oh wow!

28:31.300 --> 28:33.300
- What have you got up there?
- It's an old trunk.

28:34.333 --> 28:36.767
It's got some weight.

28:36.900 --> 28:38.000
- Heavy?

28:42.700 --> 28:44.133
What the hell is that?

28:45.900 --> 28:47.233
That's pretty cool.

28:47.367 --> 28:48.800
- Holy crap, it's full!

28:48.934 --> 28:50.700
It looks like World War I stuff
or something.

28:50.834 --> 28:52.467
Justin: Is that a bayonet?

28:52.600 --> 28:54.467
- Yeah. Let's look at it
outside.

28:54.600 --> 28:57.033
- Okay. Slide it over, we'll,
we'll drag it out of here.

28:57.166 --> 29:00.433
- Wait. Close it up nice. It's
a nice box too.

29:00.567 --> 29:03.400
- Yeah.
- We might have something with
this old chest.

29:03.533 --> 29:05.400
This is why I love a good
crawlspace.

29:05.533 --> 29:07.033
It never fails.

Brandon: Let's crack this thing
open.

Justin: Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho.
What's that?

29:13.200 --> 29:14.967
- Look at this, pile of bullet
shells.

29:15.100 --> 29:17.100
- Wow.
- They've rusted together.

29:17.233 --> 29:19.967
So this is from the war.
- 1907, Ross Rifle.

29:20.100 --> 29:21.767
- My grandfather had
the same one.

29:21.900 --> 29:24.767
- That is very cool. I think it
sharpens it on the way in.

29:24.900 --> 29:28.300
- See that, Brandon, look.
It goes to the tip of the gun.

29:28.433 --> 29:30.433
- Yeah.
- Look at this compass.

29:30.567 --> 29:33.300
That's sweet, eh?
This is all war stuff.

29:33.433 --> 29:35.200
This is a great find.

29:35.333 --> 29:37.367
This could have been the
veteran's family,

29:37.500 --> 29:39.700
the veteran himself
could have lived here.

29:39.834 --> 29:41.500
He could have passed,
he could have found the chest

29:41.633 --> 29:43.166
and just stashed it away.

29:43.300 --> 29:46.200
Whatever the case, hopefully
I can find out more

29:46.333 --> 29:47.967
about these items
and the value.

29:48.100 --> 29:50.266
The box alone is very cool.
- No, it's sweet.

in the back of my truck?

42:44.100 --> 42:45.834
into a building, you're like,
what's in here?

42:45.967 --> 42:47.867
- Yeah.
- It was a tough decision,

42:48.000 --> 42:49.867
I'm, I'm not going to lie.

42:50.000 --> 42:51.734
I'm here because I wanna come
back.

42:51.867 --> 42:53.867
- Yeah! Yeah!
- You like that?

42:54.000 --> 42:55.633
- Yeah. What am I going to do
otherwise?

42:55.767 --> 42:57.333
- So I'm bored (beep),
let's do something.

42:57.467 --> 42:59.500
- Go wreck a place. This place
here where I found this.

42:59.633 --> 43:02.166
- Yeah.
- A little, it's like a mobile
home.

43:02.300 --> 43:03.700
- So we're starting me off
slow?

43:03.834 --> 43:05.266
- Baby steps. The machine's
there, we already salvaged.

43:05.400 --> 43:06.934
Brandon: Hey.
- Hey, good news.

43:07.066 --> 43:08.700
- What?
- Justin's back.

43:08.834 --> 43:10.200
- Back for good?
- Yeah, he's back for good.

43:10.333 --> 43:12.166
- Hey.
- Just we, can we have a minute
though?

43:12.300 --> 43:14.533
Can I just have a minute?
- Are you serious?

43:14.667 --> 43:17.567
- No, I'm not serious!
- Oh you, you've done it to me

43:17.700 --> 43:19.734
a few times already. You're
going to wreck the place

43:19.867 --> 43:21.734
in Proton then, right?
- Yeah. That wood stove,

43:21.867 --> 43:23.233
can you clean it out a
little bit?

43:23.367 --> 43:24.867
- Yeah. I can do that.
Glad you're back, Justin.

43:25.000 --> 43:27.200
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah, glad to see you too,
bud.

43:27.333 --> 43:28.934
- Let's go.
- Yep.

43:29.066 --> 43:31.233
- You're gonna have fun again.
- Yeah. I can't wait to go in

43:31.367 --> 43:32.867
the doors and see what's there.
- It's very dirty,

43:33.000 --> 43:34.967
not like the candy shop.

43:37.166 --> 43:39.200
Justin: Part of me thought it
was time for something new.

43:39.333 --> 43:41.800
But working at the candy shop
fulltime is just not for me.

43:41.934 --> 43:43.867
I don't know what the future
holds,

43:44.000 --> 43:46.166
but I know I made
the right choice.

43:47.400 --> 43:49.166
You know, this was a small job

43:49.300 --> 43:51.066
but it felt great to be back
in the seat.

43:51.200 --> 43:53.033
The seat is my home. It just
feels like I never left.

43:55.734 --> 43:58.467
Ted: I was really worried
we might lose Justin,

43:58.600 --> 44:01.133
but the team is back together,
full steam ahead.
