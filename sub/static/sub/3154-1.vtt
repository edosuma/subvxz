Well, I got the sack.
I'm unemployed.

01:14.458 --> 01:17.462
- Yes. But it wasn't your fault, was it?
- That's why I'm depressed.

- And Washington.
- Hello.

08:41.667 --> 08:45.251
Then he became a spin doctor for the

08:45.417 --> 08:46.839
Is that a fair summation, Martin?

08:47.000 --> 08:50.834
That's fair enough. I always say,

Maybe get back into journalism.

09:03.708 --> 09:06.131
I remember you!

09:06.292 --> 09:08.340
You're the one who sent

saying it was a good day
to bury bad news on 9/11.

09:11.875 --> 09:14.253
- No, that was someone else.
- Well, I thought it was you.

09:14.417 --> 09:18.047
No, it's a common mistake. On the
day of Princess Margaret's funeral,

09:18.208 --> 09:21.178
I sent an e-mail saying let's make
sure the only thing we "bury",

09:21.333 --> 09:24.257
- today, is Princess Margaret.
- Which is slightly different.

09:24.417 --> 09:26.385
It's very different,
actually... But...

09:26.542 --> 09:29.421
If you want to get back into
journalism, you should talk to Sally.

09:29.583 --> 09:33.884
I just do sob stories, human interest.
It's not really your cup of tea, is it?

09:34.042 --> 09:35.042
Well...

09:35.167 --> 09:38.467
But I'll be happy to have a look if
you want to push any ideas my way.

09:38.625 --> 09:40.719
Yes... Please.

09:48.083 --> 09:51.713
Excuse me. Do you have a
glass of Pinot Grigio?

09:52.833 --> 09:54.426

09:54.583 --> 09:57.006
I'll have white, please.

09:58.667 --> 10:01.045
I couldn't help overhearing
you're a journalist.

10:01.208 --> 10:03.961
I know this woman, she had a
baby when she was a teenager

10:04.125 --> 10:06.548
and she's kept it
secret for 50 years.

10:06.708 --> 10:08.836
I only found out today.

10:09.667 --> 10:13.001
Sorry. The baby was taken
from her by these nuns.

10:14.208 --> 10:17.257
- They made her have him adopted.
- Mm.

10:17.417 --> 10:20.261
And she's kept it a
secret all this time.

10:20.958 --> 10:25.259
Well, the thing is, I'm working on a book
at the moment about Russian history.

10:25.417 --> 10:26.464
That's my thing.

10:26.625 --> 10:30.129
And what you're talking about would be
what they call a human interest story.

10:30.292 --> 10:31.794
I don't do those.

10:32.667 --> 10:34.260
Why not?

10:34.417 --> 10:39.469
Because "human interest story"
is a euphemism for stories about

10:39.625 --> 10:42.003
weak-minded, vulnerable,
ignorant people,

10:42.167 --> 10:46.468
to put in newspapers read by vulnerable,
weak-minded, ignorant people.

10:47.250 --> 10:51.209
Not that you are. And, yeah,
anyway, I hope you find him.

10:57.750 --> 11:00.344
Do you think I should do
a human interest story?

I told her they'd tell her first for sure.

- He was. How did you get this?

15:38.833 --> 15:42.963
I borrowed a Box Brownie and took it
when Reverend Mother wasn't looking.

15:44.417 --> 15:46.169
Thank you.

I say a little prayer for Anunciata,

I gave birth to him.

that, I'd have nothing.

to spare that from the flames.

believed I'd committed

Right, so just tea and cake, then?

34:07.708 --> 34:10.302
That's all they've ever
given you, isn't it, Mum?

34:12.083 --> 34:14.005
It's not their fault, Jane.

34:14.167 --> 34:16.545
They had a fire and all
the records were lost.

34:16.708 --> 34:19.130
- No, thank you. It's past your bedtime.
- Thank you.

34:19.292 --> 34:22.341
Now, he's just poured
it now. Slainte.

34:22.833 --> 34:24.505
Mother.

34:28.958 --> 34:31.928
- Right. Night, Martin.
- Night, Jane.

34:32.083 --> 34:35.417
- Night-night, Martin.
- Night, Philomena. Sleep well.

34:38.542 --> 34:39.964
Cheers.

34:40.125 --> 34:42.219
- Been up to the Abbey?
- Mm.

34:42.750 --> 34:44.342
Yes. Yes, it's um...

34:45.083 --> 34:47.962
Things obviously very different now.
The nuns are different.

34:48.125 --> 34:50.753
Not the same ones they had when
the Magdalen girls were there.

34:50.917 --> 34:53.511
<font color="#804040">WOMAN</font>:
Sure. They're all gone now!

34:53.667 --> 34:55.679
We've had a few staying
here, looking to find

34:55.693 --> 34:57.717
what happened to their
sons or daughters.

34:57.875 --> 34:59.627
Not many of them get
any joy from there.

34:59.792 --> 35:03.126
And the big fire that destroyed everything.
Do you know how that started?

35:03.292 --> 35:06.262
- I should think they put a match to it.
- Who?

35:06.417 --> 35:09.626
The Sisters. Sure they had a great
fire on the field out the back.

35:09.792 --> 35:11.886
What, so the Abbey wasn't on fire?

35:12.042 --> 35:15.751
They had a bloody big bonfire. Burnt
all the records. Thousands of 'em.

35:15.917 --> 35:18.136
- Why? I mean...
- This is years ago.

35:18.292 --> 35:21.296
I suppose they were embarrassed
about selling babies to America.

35:21.458 --> 35:23.460
And they don't want
people telling tales.

35:23.625 --> 35:27.209
- That's me mother.
- You say they sold babies to Americans?

35:27.375 --> 35:30.254
A lot of the Yanks came over
to Ireland to look for babies.

35:30.417 --> 35:32.511
They were the only ones
who could afford them.

35:32.667 --> 35:34.419
£1,000.

35:34.583 --> 35:38.258
Jane Russell bought a baby from
Derry in 1952... the film star.

35:38.417 --> 35:41.876
- I can't believe they sold babies.
- She came in here looking for Bourbon,

35:42.042 --> 35:44.886
but they had to give her
a glass of Paddy instead.

35:45.042 --> 35:47.921
If you were a Catholic with
£1,000, you could buy a baby.

35:48.083 --> 35:51.166
Jane Russell bought one
to take home with her.

35:51.333 --> 35:53.051
But I'm not one to repeat gossip.

35:53.208 --> 35:55.210
No, no, I can see that.

35:55.375 --> 35:58.254
- Slainte.
- Yes, cheers.

36:14.250 --> 36:16.326
<i><font color="#804040">MARTIN</font>: Sally, you told
me to call you if I came</i>

36:16.339 --> 36:18.426
<i>up with something and
this fell into my lap.</i>

36:18.583 --> 36:21.336
- Go on.
- It's quite interesting, actually.

36:21.500 --> 36:25.550
I think there are themes about people
searching for their family trees

36:25.708 --> 36:28.712
and the whole Irish Diaspora...

36:28.875 --> 36:31.048
Don't use words like
diaspora, Martin.

36:31.208 --> 36:33.506
I can't spell it and people
don't know what it means.

36:33.667 --> 36:35.465
<i>The exodus that followed
the Irish famine.</i>

36:35.625 --> 36:39.209
No, no, no. I'm genuinely not
interested in what it means.

36:39.375 --> 36:40.376
OK.

36:40.542 --> 36:42.670
Who are the goodies?
Who are the baddies?

36:42.833 --> 36:45.962
Well, it's about a
little old Irish lady,

36:46.125 --> 36:50.926
a retired nurse, who is searching for
her long lost son who was taken-

36:51.083 --> 36:55.384
snatched from her at
birth - by... evil nuns.

36:56.625 --> 37:00.334
So how does it end? And it's got
to be really happy or really sad.

37:00.500 --> 37:03.879
Either he's chairman of IBM
or a hobo, it doesn't matter.

37:04.042 --> 37:08.051
The years melted away as
a 50-year silence was

37:08.076 --> 37:11.656
broken by two simple
words, "Hello, Mum."

37:11.792 --> 37:13.044
I could write it now.

37:15.292 --> 37:17.511
I didn't know you were so cynical.

37:17.667 --> 37:20.591
My guess is that Anthony was
adopted and sent to America.

37:20.750 --> 37:24.300
The Abbey dealt almost exclusively
with American customers.

37:24.458 --> 37:26.261
I can't believe
they sold babies.

37:26.274 --> 37:28.088
They were trying to
give him a better life.

37:28.250 --> 37:30.753
- They tried to make money out of him!
- There's a problem.

37:30.917 --> 37:34.922
I got through to the Sacred Heart
Adoption Society in Cork this morning.

37:35.083 --> 37:37.802
They referred me to the
Irish Adoption Board,

37:37.958 --> 37:40.461
who referred me back to the
Sacred Heart Adoption Society.

37:40.625 --> 37:42.468
- Around in circles!
- They won't help us.

37:42.625 --> 37:45.629
But I spoke to some contacts from
my Washington days last night,

37:45.792 --> 37:48.341
and there are avenues we
can pursue in America.

37:49.125 --> 37:53.380
The stumbling block is I can only get so
far speaking on your behalf, Philomena.

37:53.542 --> 37:58.423
But as his mother, they would be legally
bound to provide you with the information.

37:58.583 --> 38:01.052
Are you suggesting you take my
mother to America with you?

38:01.208 --> 38:05.133
If you want. My editor's
agreed to foot the bill.

38:05.917 --> 38:08.466
How would you feel about
going to America with Martin?

38:09.167 --> 38:11.044
Uh... I... I don't know.

38:11.208 --> 38:12.835
I could come with you if you like.

38:13.000 --> 38:15.128
No, no, no, you have your work.

38:15.292 --> 38:19.126
I'm worried that Martin will have to go all
that way with a daft old woman like me.

38:19.292 --> 38:21.420
- I don't think you're daft.
- Go away, would you?

38:21.583 --> 38:23.677
Or old.

38:27.167 --> 38:29.295
I think I would like to go.

38:31.417 --> 38:34.216
I'd like to know if Anthony
ever thought of me...

38:36.667 --> 38:38.886
cos I've thought
of him every day.

38:47.208 --> 38:48.960
Ooh, Washington. Lovely.

38:49.917 --> 38:53.501
- Did you pack your baggage yourself?
- Yes. My daughter helped me.

38:54.208 --> 38:57.587
I'm getting the royal treatment,
Martin. I feel like the Pope.

38:57.750 --> 38:58.842
<font color="#808080">(CHUCKLES)</font>

38:59.000 --> 39:00.752
Well, it'll save your hip.

39:01.750 --> 39:04.344
Is that an interesting book?
I've just finished mine.

39:04.500 --> 39:08.505
Uh... Yeah, no, mine's rather dull.
It's about the October Revolution.

39:08.667 --> 39:11.876
- Political horse-trading...
- Oh, mine's about horses.

39:12.042 --> 39:15.251
It's about this fellow, Robert,
and he's engaged to this duchess.

39:15.417 --> 39:18.591
And he's only the son of a doctor,
so he's done very well for himself.

39:18.750 --> 39:21.549
But this woman,
this duchess, she's terrible.

39:21.708 --> 39:25.008
She's as vain as you like, and she's
always looking at herself in the mirror

39:25.167 --> 39:26.419
and all that sort of thing.

39:26.583 --> 39:29.086
Anyway, she thinks he's
as dull as ditch-water

39:29.250 --> 39:33.005
so he takes up an interest in the horses
so he can get in with the upper classes.

39:33.167 --> 39:35.886
And, of course, he meets this
girl down at the stables.

39:36.042 --> 39:38.170
And she's not even a
doctor's daughter.

39:38.333 --> 39:41.633
Her father's a farmhand and
he only has the one foot.

39:41.792 --> 39:44.170
- Oh, dear.
- But of course they fall in love.

39:44.333 --> 39:46.427
And now he's torn between
becoming a duke-

39:46.583 --> 39:50.213
if he marries the duchess, he'll become
lord of the manor and all that...

39:50.375 --> 39:52.377
- OK.
- ..And the stable girl who he loves,

39:52.542 --> 39:54.340
but she hasn't a penny to her name.

39:54.500 --> 39:57.128
Well, the big day's coming,
the wedding, and this girl...

39:57.292 --> 40:02.253
This girl, she's lovely. She
says Robert has to do his duty.

40:02.417 --> 40:05.796
He's already spoken for.
And he's being measured for a suit.

40:05.958 --> 40:09.337
You can tell his heart's not in it cos
all the while he's thinking about

40:09.500 --> 40:11.218
the horses and the stable girl.

40:11.375 --> 40:14.709
So they're all waiting for him
at the church, all the hoi polloi,

40:14.875 --> 40:16.877
but the thing is,
Martin, this duchess,

40:16.902 --> 40:19.952
she only wants Robert to spite
the fella she's really after.

40:20.083 --> 40:24.543
And then towards the end she finds out that
the stable girl has designs on Robert.

40:24.708 --> 40:27.641
But before that, the father
with the one foot dies

40:27.666 --> 40:30.194
and he says to Robert,
"Follow your heart."

40:30.333 --> 40:33.792
The duchess gives the stable girl her
marching orders and she packs her things.

40:33.958 --> 40:37.132
There's a pony and trap waiting
outside and she gets in, she says,

40:37.292 --> 40:38.669
"Do you know where we're going?"

40:38.833 --> 40:41.757
And the driver turns round,
and if it isn't your man Robert!

40:41.917 --> 40:45.251
And he says, "I'm taking you to a place
where no one can hurt you any more."

40:45.417 --> 40:48.421
Well, I didn't see that coming,
Martin, not in a million years.

40:48.583 --> 40:50.210
It's nice when there's a surprise.

40:50.375 --> 40:52.798
- Sounds like a real page-turner.
- You can borrow it.

40:52.958 --> 40:54.960
- That's OK.
- No, no. I've just finished it now.

40:55.125 --> 40:58.004
Well, I feel like
I've almost read it.

40:59.750 --> 41:02.048
The Slipper And The Horse Shoe.

41:04.000 --> 41:05.843
Oh, there's a series of them.

41:10.833 --> 41:12.255
Champagne or Buck's Fizz?

41:12.417 --> 41:14.886
- No, thank you.
- Oh. No, thank you.

41:16.250 --> 41:21.711
- It's free.
- Oh. I say! I'll have a Buck's Fizz.

41:26.000 --> 41:29.300
Thank you. This is lovely, Martin.

41:30.917 --> 41:32.919
You have to pay for
everything on Ryanair.

41:33.083 --> 41:35.802
- Well, they don't have club class.
- Slainte.

41:38.625 --> 41:39.751
Martin!

41:39.917 --> 41:42.136
- Alex, how are you?
- Not seen you since you...

41:42.292 --> 41:45.091
left the department. I was
gonna call you, actually.

41:45.250 --> 41:46.923
- Still friends?
- Absolutely.

41:47.083 --> 41:49.006
I hope you didn't think
I dropped you in it.

41:49.167 --> 41:50.840
Don't worry about it.
The fog of war.

41:51.000 --> 41:52.673
Yeah, collateral damage.

41:53.792 --> 41:55.715
So, what are you up to?
Off to the primaries?

41:55.875 --> 41:57.593
- Yes, yes.
- No. He's helping me look...

41:57.750 --> 42:01.755
I'm just... We're just here... It's
a human interest story. Journalism.

42:02.792 --> 42:05.261
Well, good luck with it.
Listen, I better scoot back.

42:05.417 --> 42:07.260
OK.

42:07.417 --> 42:10.261
I'm sorry, Martin. Should we
pretend we don't know each other?

42:10.417 --> 42:13.091
No. No, no, no, it's... It's just
someone I used to work with.

42:13.250 --> 42:15.673
A spin doctor. I'm
trying to avoid them.

42:16.792 --> 42:20.342
- Is that first class in there?
- It's just a perk of the job.

42:21.583 --> 42:25.713
Just cos you're in first class, it
doesn't make you a first-class person.

42:26.625 --> 42:28.719
He's all right.

42:30.583 --> 42:33.632
I think he needs a
good swipe of shite.

42:36.708 --> 42:38.585
Yes, you're probably right.

Yes, I did, yes.

- Yes.

43:45.458 --> 43:48.792

44:08.875 --> 44:10.718
OK. Bye-bye.

44:14.917 --> 44:16.794
Shall we go for a walk,
get rid of the jet lag?

44:16.958 --> 44:19.131
You said you wanted to visit
the Lincoln Memorial?

44:19.292 --> 44:20.919
We could go and see Mr Lincoln.

44:21.083 --> 44:25.634
Or we could watch, on television,
Big Momma's House.

44:25.792 --> 44:29.001
It's about a little black man
pretending to be a fat black lady.

44:29.167 --> 44:31.761
They've just showed some
of it on the television.

44:31.917 --> 44:34.716
And they're all chasing after him.

44:34.875 --> 44:37.128
It looked hilarious, Martin.

44:40.833 --> 44:42.927
Isn't he wonderful?

44:43.292 --> 44:45.841
I've always wanted to see
him in his big chair.

44:46.000 --> 44:48.753
Well, he was a big man.

44:50.083 --> 44:53.383
Literally - six foot four.
Tallest American President.

44:53.542 --> 44:56.751
Well, you can see that.
He's tall even sitting down.

44:57.625 --> 45:01.755
I had a friend whose daughter paid for her
to go to Florida for her 70th birthday.

45:01.917 --> 45:05.751
She said to me, "Phil, the size of
the portions, you wouldn't believe."

45:05.917 --> 45:08.591
If you just go... Let's just
take a quick picture, see.

45:08.750 --> 45:10.002
You go stand by the line.

45:10.167 --> 45:12.420
- Is this for the article?
- It is. Just go back further.

45:12.583 --> 45:14.836
Only I'm a little bit worried,
because if we find him,

45:15.000 --> 45:17.879
he might be very disapproving
of talking to the papers.

45:18.042 --> 45:19.294
Families are private things.

45:19.458 --> 45:22.177
I know. Go and stand back there.
That's true, they are private,

45:22.333 --> 45:24.939
but tracking him down's an
expensive business, and

45:24.964 --> 45:27.364
so it's sort of like a
quid pro quo, isn't it?

45:27.500 --> 45:31.255
- What does that mean?
- Well, it literally means this for that.

45:31.417 --> 45:34.876
Don't worry. I won't write anything you're
unhappy with. I want to tell the truth.

45:35.042 --> 45:37.511
Yes. That's the thing
I'm worried about.

45:37.667 --> 45:39.920
Should I smile or
should I be serious?

45:40.083 --> 45:44.213
Erm... Let's do one happy,
one not so happy.

45:50.292 --> 45:53.876
I'm getting scared, now
we're getting closer.

45:54.458 --> 45:58.258
All these years, wondering whether
Anthony was in trouble or in... prison,

45:58.417 --> 46:00.044
or goodness knows where.

46:00.542 --> 46:03.921
As long as I didn't know, I could always
tell myself he was happy somewhere

46:04.083 --> 46:06.427
and that he was doing all right.

46:06.583 --> 46:08.756
But what if he died in Vietnam?

46:08.917 --> 46:11.636
Or came back with no legs,
or lived on the street...

46:14.917 --> 46:17.261
Don't upset yourself. Hm?

46:17.417 --> 46:20.671

46:20.833 --> 46:22.927
Well, what if he was a
drug addict, Martin?

46:24.458 --> 46:26.210
Or what if he was obese?

Obese?

46:36.792 --> 46:38.558
What on earth makes you
think he'd be obese?

46:38.583 --> 46:41.336
Because of the size
of the portions.

again on the way down.

58:02.250 --> 58:04.799
He was by the door when we went...
I shook hands with him.

58:04.958 --> 58:07.507
Well, what kind of a
handshake did he have?

58:07.917 --> 58:11.000
It was firm. I mean, I would remember
if he'd had a weak handshake.

58:11.167 --> 58:13.590
You don't get to that position
with a weak handshake.

58:13.750 --> 58:15.548
So he had a firm
handshake, what else?

58:16.583 --> 58:19.086
- He was smart.
- I always kept him smart.

58:19.875 --> 58:21.969
And did you remember
anything he said?

58:23.583 --> 58:25.301
- "Hello."
- "Hello. Hello."

58:25.458 --> 58:26.550
Might've been "hi".

58:26.708 --> 58:28.210
- "Hello."
- He was polite.

58:28.375 --> 58:32.380
Well... Now, well, he was smart,
and he had a firm handshake.

58:32.542 --> 58:35.295
- He said hello, which was nice.
- He said hello. Hello.

58:35.917 --> 58:38.386
- He was polite.
- Oh, Martin!

58:45.167 --> 58:49.126
I...knew your son for
about ten years.

58:51.000 --> 58:55.881
He was senior legal counsel to both
the Reagan and Bush administrations.

58:56.542 --> 58:59.045
He didn't do too badly,
did he, Philomena?

59:01.417 --> 59:04.261
He'd never have got a job like
that if he'd stayed with me.

59:06.083 --> 59:08.177

worked at McEverleys.

59:08.958 --> 59:11.302
That's a firm of
solicitors in Castlebar.

59:13.000 --> 59:15.253
Did he ever mention
Ireland, Marcia?

59:15.417 --> 59:17.385
I don't think so.

59:17.542 --> 59:19.795
Although I do have a number
for his sister, Mary,

59:19.958 --> 59:21.960
- who came over from Ireland with him.
- Great.

59:22.125 --> 59:24.503
- I can put you in touch.
- Great, that's excellent.

59:24.667 --> 59:26.669
He looks very happy here.

59:28.833 --> 59:30.380
Who's this fella?

59:31.208 --> 59:33.802
That's his friend Pete.

59:37.458 --> 59:42.168
- And were you his girlfriend, Marcia?
- Oh... <font color="#808080">(CHUCKLES)</font> No.

59:43.917 --> 59:46.420
I don't know if you knew,
but he was gay.

59:47.708 --> 59:51.087
I used to accompany him when
he'd go to official functions

59:51.250 --> 59:54.675
because being gay was frowned
on in the Republican Party.

59:59.375 --> 01:00:02.174
But he was very charming
and charismatic.

01:00:03.542 --> 01:00:06.341
Tell me, did he
father any children?

01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:09.629
Philomena, Marcia's just told
us that Anthony was gay.

01:00:09.792 --> 01:00:13.626
Well, I always knew that. But I just
wondered if he might be bi-curious.

01:00:13.792 --> 01:00:16.215
- Bi-curious?
- A lot of nurses I worked with were gay

01:00:16.375 --> 01:00:19.879
but one of them called Brendan
told me he was bi-curious.

01:00:20.042 --> 01:00:23.046
I don't think he could
make up his mind, Marcia.

01:00:23.208 --> 01:00:26.052
He didn't have any children.
I'm sorry.

01:00:29.458 --> 01:00:31.301
Did Pete love him?

01:00:31.458 --> 01:00:33.301
Yes, he did.

01:00:34.167 --> 01:00:37.341
Phil, how did you know he was gay?

01:00:37.625 --> 01:00:40.253
Well, he was a very
sensitive little boy.

01:00:40.417 --> 01:00:44.593
And as the years rolled on, I always
wondered whether he might be.

01:00:45.292 --> 01:00:49.877
When I saw the photograph of him in the
dungarees, there was no doubt in my mind.

Why did you keep this a
secret for 50 years?

01:01:29.042 --> 01:01:33.001
What I'd done was a sin
and I kept it all hidden away.

01:01:33.792 --> 01:01:37.717
And then I thought to myself
that keeping it all hidden away

01:01:37.875 --> 01:01:40.594
was also a sin because
I was lying to everybody.

01:01:43.083 --> 01:01:46.007
And as it went on I tied
myself up in knots,

01:01:46.167 --> 01:01:51.003
worrying which was the worse sin of the
two, having the baby or the lying.

01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:54.504
Well, in the end, I couldn't
make up my mind, Martin.

01:01:55.667 --> 01:01:59.422
I was going to ask you, Martin, if it'd
be possible not to use my real name

01:01:59.583 --> 01:02:01.176
when you write the story?

01:02:01.333 --> 01:02:05.167
Perhaps you could call me Nancy?
I've always loved that name, Nancy.

01:02:05.333 --> 01:02:07.210
I have a niece called Nancy.

01:02:07.375 --> 01:02:09.173
Oh, no, maybe they'd
think it's her.

01:02:09.458 --> 01:02:13.133
- What about Anne? Anne Boleyn?
- Anne Boleyn?

01:02:13.292 --> 01:02:15.215
That's a lovely name.
Somebody had that...

01:02:15.375 --> 01:02:17.326
We'll have to use your
real name, Philomena.

01:02:17.339 --> 01:02:19.300
That's the way
these things work.

01:02:31.042 --> 01:02:32.635
- Mary?
- Yes.

01:02:32.792 --> 01:02:37.093
Hello, it's Martin. This is Philomena
Lee. Anthony's mother.

01:02:37.250 --> 01:02:39.344
Well, Michael's mother.

01:02:42.042 --> 01:02:43.919
OK.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.547
That's our mother.

01:02:46.708 --> 01:02:48.802
I mean, our adoptive mother.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.594
Was she a nice lady, Mary?
She looks a nice lady.

01:02:52.750 --> 01:02:57.051
You know, I'm not gonna lie to you. We
didn't have the happiest childhood.

01:02:57.208 --> 01:03:01.418
Marge was OK, but our father, Doc,
he could be a very hard man.

01:03:04.750 --> 01:03:06.844
Stop torturing her!

01:03:08.292 --> 01:03:10.795
And that's him with Pete Olsson.

01:03:12.375 --> 01:03:14.469
Mike and Pete were...

01:03:14.625 --> 01:03:18.584
That's all right, Mary. I know
Anthony was a gay homosexual.

01:03:19.375 --> 01:03:23.585
And we met Marcia, who I believe
was his beard. Is that right, Martin?

01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:25.423
Yes, that's about right.

01:03:25.583 --> 01:03:30.384
It must have been terrible, having
to keep it a secret his whole life.

01:03:32.542 --> 01:03:35.216
- I assume my son died from AIDS.
- Yes.

01:03:36.167 --> 01:03:40.422
He wasn't too happy the last couple of
years of his life working for Reagan.

01:03:40.583 --> 01:03:42.176
He was pretty messed up about it.

01:03:42.333 --> 01:03:44.506
The Republicans withdrew
funding for AIDS research

01:03:44.667 --> 01:03:47.750
because they blamed the
epidemic on gay lifestyles.

01:03:47.917 --> 01:03:50.506
Right, because some of
them wouldn't wear condoms

01:03:50.531 --> 01:03:52.652
because they said it
spoilt the feeling.

01:03:56.208 --> 01:03:58.006
Where is he buried, Mary?

01:03:58.167 --> 01:04:02.343
Dad wanted him buried in the family plot
in St Louis, but Pete wouldn't allow it.

01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:04.719
There was a huge fight.

01:04:04.875 --> 01:04:08.300
I didn't go in the end.
I didn't want to get involved.

01:04:08.458 --> 01:04:11.962
- You can talk to Pete about it.
- Yes, we have Pete's number.

01:04:12.125 --> 01:04:15.049
I think we're going to pay him
a visit, aren't we, Philomena?

01:04:18.083 --> 01:04:20.085
Mm...

01:04:20.542 --> 01:04:24.376
Can I just ask you one thing, Mary?
There's something I need to know.

01:04:24.542 --> 01:04:28.422
Did Anthony ever mention Ireland,
or where he'd come from?

01:04:32.125 --> 01:04:35.550
Not really, no. We didn't
really talk about that.

01:04:37.083 --> 01:04:39.177
No. Why would you?

01:04:43.583 --> 01:04:46.917
- Do you want some sugar, or some milk?
- If you wouldn't mind.

01:04:47.083 --> 01:04:49.177
Thank you very much
for your hospitality.

01:05:07.917 --> 01:05:11.876
It seems odd that she was in the same
room as someone who knew her mother,

01:05:12.042 --> 01:05:14.090
and yet she asked you
no questions about her.

01:05:15.250 --> 01:05:16.627
I don't think it's odd.

01:05:16.792 --> 01:05:20.046
She'd just be asking questions
about someone she didn't know.

01:05:24.292 --> 01:05:27.262
I'd like to go to confession.
We passed a church on the way here.

01:05:27.792 --> 01:05:30.341
Why do you want to
go to confession?

01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:32.127
To confess my sins, of course.

01:05:32.292 --> 01:05:34.636
What sins?

01:05:34.792 --> 01:05:37.671
The Catholic Church should
go to confession, not you.

01:05:37.833 --> 01:05:39.506
"Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned."

01:05:39.667 --> 01:05:42.216
I incarcerated a load of young
women against their will,

01:05:42.375 --> 01:05:45.504
"used them as slave labour, then sold
their babies to the highest bidder."

01:05:45.667 --> 01:05:47.089
I hope God isn't listening to you.

01:05:47.250 --> 01:05:50.129
Well, I don't believe in God.
So, look, no thunderbolt.

01:05:50.292 --> 01:05:51.669
What are you trying to prove?

01:05:51.833 --> 01:05:55.292
Nothing, just that you don't need religion
to lead a happy and balanced life.

01:05:55.458 --> 01:05:57.301
And you're happy and
balanced, are you?

01:05:57.458 --> 01:05:59.927
I'm a journalist, Philomena.
We ask questions.

01:06:00.083 --> 01:06:03.053
We don't believe something just
because we're told it's the truth.

01:06:03.208 --> 01:06:06.883
Yet what does the Bible say? "Happy are
those who do not see yet believe."

01:06:07.042 --> 01:06:08.885
Hooray for blind
faith and ignorance.

01:06:09.042 --> 01:06:12.876
And what do you believe in? Picking holes
in everyone else and being a smart aleck?

01:06:13.625 --> 01:06:15.298
Taking photos whenever you like?

01:06:17.958 --> 01:06:21.041
I read a very funny headline in a
satirical newspaper the other day,

01:06:21.208 --> 01:06:22.551
about the earthquake in Turkey.

01:06:22.708 --> 01:06:25.257
It said, "God outdoes
terrorists yet again."

01:06:25.417 --> 01:06:27.294
Why God feels the need
to suddenly wipe out

01:06:27.458 --> 01:06:29.756
hundreds of thousands of
innocent people escapes me.

01:06:29.917 --> 01:06:32.045
You should ask Him about
that while you're in there.

01:06:32.208 --> 01:06:34.131
He'll probably say He
moves in mysterious ways.

01:06:34.292 --> 01:06:37.341
No, I think He'd say you
we're a feckin' eejit.

01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:54.173
Hello.

01:06:56.458 --> 01:06:57.835
Hello?

01:06:58.500 --> 01:06:59.968
- <i>Oh, hello.</i>
- Hi, Sally.

01:07:00.125 --> 01:07:01.468
- <i>What have you got?</i>
- Guess what.

01:07:01.625 --> 01:07:05.255
He was a big-shot lawyer for both the
Reagan and Bush administrations.

01:07:05.417 --> 01:07:07.215
<i>You're kidding. That's amazing!</i>

01:07:07.375 --> 01:07:11.585
And at the same time he was a
closet homosexual who died of AIDS.

01:07:12.250 --> 01:07:15.333
<i>Oh... This is perfect for
the weekend section.</i>

01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:17.377
And... I met him.

01:07:17.542 --> 01:07:18.964
- You knew him?
- Yeah.

01:07:19.125 --> 01:07:22.755
- So there's a personal angle?
- <i>Yeah, that's one of the angles.</i>

01:07:22.917 --> 01:07:26.296
But people need to know what happened
to him. There's a real injustice here.

01:07:26.458 --> 01:07:28.927
<i>What about the evil nuns?
What's happening with them?</i>

01:07:29.083 --> 01:07:32.633
Still there. They haven't gone away.
If anything, they're a bit more evil.

01:07:33.333 --> 01:07:34.676
<i>It's great, Martin.</i>

01:07:34.833 --> 01:07:36.676
I'll call you back in a bit.

01:07:37.625 --> 01:07:39.593

God will forgive you.

01:08:50.875 --> 01:08:54.880
Phil? Phil, you were right.
I was being a feckin' eejit.

01:08:55.042 --> 01:08:57.591
- And I'm sorry...
- I was doing some thinking in there.

01:08:57.750 --> 01:09:01.084
I'm going to get a loan from the
Bradford and Bigley, Martin.

01:09:01.250 --> 01:09:03.218
- Bingley.
- Because I don't have a mortgage.

01:09:03.375 --> 01:09:05.877
And you can get an
extension for £10,000.

01:09:06.042 --> 01:09:09.591
My friend Rene did that.
She had a conservatory built.

01:09:09.750 --> 01:09:11.627
Well, I don't need a conservatory.

01:09:11.792 --> 01:09:14.215
So I can give you all
the money and then...

01:09:15.082 --> 01:09:18.917
And then that'll cover
the costs of the hotels

01:09:19.082 --> 01:09:21.926
and all the flights and everything
and you won't be out-of-pocket,

01:09:22.082 --> 01:09:24.676
and you won't publish the story
cos I don't want it published.

01:09:24.832 --> 01:09:26.801
I don't want anyone to
know about this, ever.

01:09:26.957 --> 01:09:31.589
Phil, you've done nothing wrong. You're
entitled to know who your son was.

01:09:31.750 --> 01:09:33.673
Well, you heard what Mary said.

01:09:33.832 --> 01:09:35.676
She said he never gave
me a second thought.

01:09:35.832 --> 01:09:38.551
He wasn't my Anthony, he was
somebody else's Michael.

01:09:38.707 --> 01:09:41.587
- He probably hated the thought of me.
- You don't know that.

01:09:41.750 --> 01:09:43.627
I should never have let
him out of my sight.

01:09:43.792 --> 01:09:46.545
We just need to talk

01:09:58.500 --> 01:10:01.800
- <i>I believe you've called before, sir.</i>
- Yes. I've called a couple of times

01:10:01.958 --> 01:10:03.130
and no one's calling me back.

01:10:03.292 --> 01:10:05.420
I feel like I'm hitting my
head against a brick wall.

01:10:05.583 --> 01:10:08.382
<i>We have explained Mr Olsson is too
busy to deal with this matter.</i>

01:10:08.542 --> 01:10:10.636
- Yes, yes.
- <i>So, I am unable to put you through...</i>

01:10:10.792 --> 01:10:13.214
Right, but I think if you
give me his personal number,

01:10:13.239 --> 01:10:14.867
I think he'll be OK
with that, I do.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.002
- <i>I can't give out personal numbers.</i>
- I know.

01:10:17.167 --> 01:10:21.001

Well, she wouldn't have gone
anywhere by herself.

01:11:01.208 --> 01:11:05.088
It's probably nothing, but
she's very old and Irish.

01:11:05.250 --> 01:11:08.129
And she's a relative? I can't let
you in unless she's a relative.

01:11:08.292 --> 01:11:09.544
Yes, she's my mother.

Mum?

- There you are!
- What's the matter?

01:11:33.542 --> 01:11:35.965
- I wondered where you were.
- Is your mother OK now?

01:11:36.125 --> 01:11:37.877
- Yes, thank you.
- OK, sir.

01:11:40.083 --> 01:11:42.131
I had to say that to
get him to let me in.

01:11:42.292 --> 01:11:46.718
You shouldn't have the balcony door shut
if you can't hear the door to your room.

01:11:46.875 --> 01:11:49.549
I was just having a
little cry, that's all.

01:11:49.708 --> 01:11:51.335
Right.

01:11:51.792 --> 01:11:53.294
Are you going to come back inside?

01:11:53.458 --> 01:11:55.558
You didn't think I was going
to jump off the balcony?

01:11:55.583 --> 01:11:57.460
No, of course not.

01:11:58.500 --> 01:12:01.174
Did you get through to Pete Olsson?

01:12:01.333 --> 01:12:04.303
Just to his office.
He wasn't there.

01:12:06.875 --> 01:12:09.173
He doesn't want to see me, does he?

01:12:09.333 --> 01:12:11.586
Some people have a problem
dealing with the past.

01:12:11.750 --> 01:12:15.334
Not you, though. But I'm
sure he'll come round.

<i>Your chariot awaits.</i>

<i>I got it in yellow.</i>

Now, Martin, there's something
I want to say to you.

01:13:23.875 --> 01:13:26.128
Now I've made a decision
and my mind's made up.

01:13:26.292 --> 01:13:28.135
Nothing you can say is
going to change it.

01:13:28.292 --> 01:13:31.922
I appreciate everything you've done for
me, and thank you for looking after me.

01:13:32.083 --> 01:13:34.381
And I've loved the hotels,
the food and everything,

01:13:34.542 --> 01:13:37.216
but this isn't working out
the way I wanted it to.

01:13:37.375 --> 01:13:40.584
So, tomorrow I think we ought to get
on a plane and go back to England.

01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:42.878
There it is. Now
that's an end to it.

01:13:43.250 --> 01:13:46.709
Don't try and change my mind by saying
clever things about this and that

01:13:46.875 --> 01:13:49.378
just cos you went to
Oxbridge and I didn't.

01:13:52.458 --> 01:13:54.460
I went to Oxford. Oxford.

01:13:54.625 --> 01:13:57.003
Oxbridge is a portmanteau
of Oxford and Cambridge,

01:13:57.167 --> 01:14:00.922
- where two words are joined together.
- I don't give a... shiny shoe about that.

01:14:01.083 --> 01:14:03.836
- It's all the same to me!
- We should go and visit Pete Olsson.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.469
You can go on your own!
I'm not prepared to go all that way

01:14:06.625 --> 01:14:09.925
to hear someone else tell me
I didn't give two hoots about Anthony

01:14:10.083 --> 01:14:12.677
and that I abandoned my child
and all the rest of it.

01:14:12.833 --> 01:14:13.959
What's that?

01:14:14.125 --> 01:14:16.127
- What?
- On the side of the glass there.

01:14:16.292 --> 01:14:18.169
- What? What's...
- There. This.

01:14:19.833 --> 01:14:21.801
It's a Celtic harp.

01:14:21.958 --> 01:14:24.131
So we should go home.
I'll mind my own business.

01:14:24.292 --> 01:14:28.217
I want to watch David Attenborough on
television and I'll be happy with that.

01:14:29.167 --> 01:14:31.135
And what's that?

01:14:32.833 --> 01:14:34.756
That's a Celtic harp.

01:14:34.917 --> 01:14:39.343
Why would someone who cared so little about
where he came from wear something so Irish?

01:14:41.125 --> 01:14:45.130
Well, perhaps he played
the harp. He was gay.

01:14:46.125 --> 01:14:48.219
He didn't play the harp.

01:15:47.875 --> 01:15:49.673

babies that died in childbirth.

Their suffering was
atonement for their sins.

- One of the mothers was 14 years old!
- Martin, that's enough.

in here to make a scene.

of the finest silk for the master
to wear on his wedding day.

shows him the cloak and
