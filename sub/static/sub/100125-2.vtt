[bright tone]

00:10.944 --> 00:14.047
[wind whooshing]

00:21.287 --> 00:24.391
[soft dramatic music]

00:51.551 --> 00:54.120
When you arrived at my door,
I took it as a blessing.

00:58.457 --> 01:01.161
You returned
a precious piece of my son.

01:12.471 --> 01:14.307
After that officer
left you in my charge,

01:14.340 --> 01:16.309
I knew this was
something greater.

01:17.577 --> 01:18.678
A command.

01:20.313 --> 01:23.783
The Lord has called on me
to deliver His justice,

01:23.817 --> 01:26.653
justice for the murder
of my son.

01:40.733 --> 01:42.368
Do you understand?

02:17.270 --> 02:20.373
[dramatic music]

02:30.049 --> 02:31.718
[phone vibrates]

02:44.597 --> 02:46.900
Henry, your mom is awake.
We gotta get up.

02:53.239 --> 02:55.007
[soft dramatic music]

02:55.040 --> 02:56.876
Shit.

03:00.246 --> 03:01.881
Townes, get up.
We gotta go.

03:01.915 --> 03:03.749
Henry's gone.

03:03.783 --> 03:06.785
You have to knock first, Jenna.
It's common courtesy.

03:06.819 --> 03:09.355
Just hurry and get dressed.
We need to find her.

03:10.990 --> 03:12.025
[whooshing]

03:12.058 --> 03:13.593
[both grunting]

03:14.160 --> 03:17.964
Get the fuck off me!

03:17.997 --> 03:20.867
[panting] What...

03:24.536 --> 03:25.805
What...

03:32.445 --> 03:35.515
Where... where are we?

03:38.817 --> 03:40.853
[mutters]

03:40.886 --> 03:42.788
Ah, f...

03:42.822 --> 03:45.458
[ruins rumbling]

03:49.228 --> 03:50.363
Careful.

03:51.129 --> 03:52.799
That cop's still in your room.

03:54.367 --> 03:55.868
[glass cracking]

04:08.982 --> 04:10.416
[rumbling stops]

04:10.983 --> 04:12.985
Good.

04:13.019 --> 04:14.320
You're learning.

04:14.354 --> 04:17.657
[panting softly]

04:22.027 --> 04:23.396
[sniffs]

04:25.031 --> 04:26.633
What do you want?

04:27.700 --> 04:30.269
To help you.

04:30.302 --> 04:32.137
I thought that was clear.

04:32.171 --> 04:33.940
[water dripping]

04:37.976 --> 04:39.379
Hungry?

04:41.414 --> 04:43.316
I know a place
around the corner.

04:55.628 --> 04:59.165
I just hope after we watch it,
something terrible
doesn't happen.

04:59.198 --> 05:00.866
What do you mean?

05:00.900 --> 05:02.668
Have you seen<i> The Ring?</i>

05:02.702 --> 05:04.703
Well,
there's a cursed VHS tape,

05:04.737 --> 05:07.239
and anyone who sees it has
a week to show someone else,

05:07.273 --> 05:08.908
or they're killed
by a child ghost

05:08.941 --> 05:12.778
who was pushed down a well
by her adoptive mother.

05:12.812 --> 05:15.981
I just hope something like that
doesn't happen.

05:16.015 --> 05:18.617
Yeah, me too.

05:18.650 --> 05:19.819
Townes.

05:24.390 --> 05:26.492
Shit.
What's she doing here?

05:26.525 --> 05:28.527
Do you think
she found Bill's body?

05:28.561 --> 05:31.764
Or pieces of the body,
or whatever's left of the body?

05:31.798 --> 05:33.599
Henry said it was
dissolved, right?

05:33.633 --> 05:36.903
Yeah, but how long does it take
to dissolve a body in acid?

05:36.936 --> 05:38.104
[keys jangling]

05:44.143 --> 05:45.511
[whispers]
Just act normal.

05:47.679 --> 05:49.014
[normal voice]
It's going to be fine.

05:49.047 --> 05:51.250
There's nothing to worry about.
Everything's great.

05:51.283 --> 05:53.486
Are you talking to me
or yourself?

05:53.519 --> 05:55.755
-What's happening to you?
-Just follow my lead.

05:58.758 --> 06:01.894
-[Townes] Hello.
-[Jenna] Hi, officer.

06:01.928 --> 06:04.831
We're just here to pick up
some clothes for Cleo.

06:05.898 --> 06:08.935
-We can go inside, right?
-Of course, of course.

06:12.805 --> 06:14.874
Do you want me to go in
with you?

06:15.240 --> 06:17.176
Um, no.

06:17.209 --> 06:18.911
That's okay.
We've got it.

06:19.879 --> 06:21.447
'Cause it can be hard

06:21.480 --> 06:23.648
coming home after
something like this.

06:23.682 --> 06:26.085
But it gets easier.
Promise.

06:26.819 --> 06:29.989
Right.
It just takes some time.

06:31.590 --> 06:34.860
Now, if you need anything,
don't hesitate.

06:34.893 --> 06:36.095
I'm around.

06:45.605 --> 06:47.807
[Townes whispers]
I'll get Henry.

06:48.774 --> 06:50.443
Henry?

06:57.817 --> 06:58.918
Ugh.

07:13.499 --> 07:14.967
[box clatters]

07:30.816 --> 07:33.486
Is that
the video cassette recorder?

07:35.254 --> 07:37.423
Where's the screen?

07:37.456 --> 07:39.959
It doesn't have one.
It plugs into the TV.

07:41.761 --> 07:42.829
With what?

07:43.629 --> 07:47.033
I don't know.
One of those?

07:47.066 --> 07:48.568
-Where's Henry?
-[grunts]

07:48.601 --> 07:50.703
She's not inside.

07:50.736 --> 07:53.172
Okay, well, then,
we need to go to the hospital.

07:53.205 --> 07:56.775
My dad's gonna have
so many questions,
and Cleo needs someone.

07:56.808 --> 07:58.778
No, we need to watch
the tape first.

07:58.811 --> 08:01.247
It could be the only way
to find her.

08:01.280 --> 08:02.448
Okay, fine.

08:02.481 --> 08:04.583
Then I'll cover for Henry
at the hospital

08:04.617 --> 08:07.119
while you figure out
how to work this thing.

08:07.152 --> 08:08.654
-Okay.
-Good luck.

08:11.123 --> 08:12.391

08:12.424 --> 08:15.628
[cheerful folk music playing]

08:15.661 --> 08:16.963
[man sips] Mmm.

08:28.407 --> 08:30.710
[man] You ever had
Ciorba de Burta?

08:31.843 --> 08:33.045
Try it.

08:34.146 --> 08:35.848
I want to go home.

08:37.716 --> 08:39.051
It's good for hangovers.

08:41.453 --> 08:43.189
I can smell it on you.

08:44.122 --> 08:45.224
[Daniela] Nikolai?

08:46.659 --> 08:48.060
[speaks Romanian]

08:49.194 --> 08:50.763
Nikolai.

08:54.366 --> 08:56.402

09:16.521 --> 09:18.190
[sighs]

09:19.024 --> 09:20.326
Nikolai.

09:22.194 --> 09:23.829
How's your mom?

09:25.998 --> 09:27.900
What do you care?

09:28.834 --> 09:31.037
Have you thought about
why you've left her?

09:31.070 --> 09:32.638
That's twice now.

09:33.872 --> 09:35.941
-Where's my dad?
-I don't know.

09:35.974 --> 09:37.009
Bullshit.

09:39.345 --> 09:41.647
I know you took him.

09:41.680 --> 09:43.282
When I was a kid. I remember.

09:45.451 --> 09:48.354
I take a lot of people.
That's what I do.

09:48.387 --> 09:50.355
What're you looking for?
An apology?

09:50.388 --> 09:51.757
Fuck you.

09:54.093 --> 09:55.328
I'm done, okay?

09:55.361 --> 09:57.396
I'm done with
your smirky bullshit

09:57.429 --> 09:59.564
and your
stupid fucking games, okay?

09:59.598 --> 10:02.701
You took me from my room--

10:02.734 --> 10:05.538
Like a total fucking creep,
by the way.

10:05.571 --> 10:08.607
To wherever the fuck
we are right now for what?

10:08.640 --> 10:11.410
What do you want?

10:11.444 --> 10:13.712
You wanna eat soup?

10:13.745 --> 10:16.615
I'm educating you on the
pitfalls of your short temper.

10:16.648 --> 10:18.384
[scoffs]
Go fuck yourself.

10:18.417 --> 10:20.018
You're proving my point.
Sit down.

10:20.052 --> 10:21.487
No.

10:21.520 --> 10:23.088
Hey,
if I hadn't have grabbed you,

10:23.121 --> 10:26.124
that cop would've found you,
and then what?

10:26.158 --> 10:27.726
Huh?

10:27.760 --> 10:29.094
What would you have said?
Let's hear it.

10:29.128 --> 10:31.297
Let's hear your genius
fucking excuse.

10:32.298 --> 10:34.299
It doesn't matter.
I would've figured it out.

10:34.333 --> 10:36.601
Everything you do matters.

10:36.635 --> 10:38.770
Don't you get that?

10:38.804 --> 10:41.039
You think it's your body
that's doing this to you?

10:41.073 --> 10:42.741
Killing that man?
Leaving your mom?

10:42.775 --> 10:45.043
No, it's you.
You're in control.

10:45.076 --> 10:47.413
You left your mother
because you wanted to.

10:47.446 --> 10:49.314
-No.
-It's called self-preservation.

10:49.347 --> 10:52.284
You have no idea what the fuck
you're talking about, okay?

10:52.317 --> 10:54.019
-You don't.
-Of course I do.

10:54.052 --> 10:56.755
-You're so full of shit.
-[chuckles]

10:56.788 --> 10:57.989
I don't need you, okay?

10:58.023 --> 11:01.060
I don't need you
or your fucking help.

11:01.559 --> 11:03.028
Hey! Hey.

11:03.062 --> 11:05.330
Let go of me!

No.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.908
[ominous music]

11:16.942 --> 11:17.810
No.

11:18.610 --> 11:20.179
Why--

11:20.212 --> 11:21.781
Why would you--

11:23.548 --> 11:25.417
Why would you bring me here?

11:25.450 --> 11:27.286
I didn't. You did.

11:27.920 --> 11:29.654
No, that's...
[sniffs]

11:29.688 --> 11:31.724
I would never.

11:33.191 --> 11:35.795
This is where it happened
the first time.

11:36.461 --> 11:38.064
How do you know that?

11:39.631 --> 11:42.500
It's my job.

11:42.534 --> 11:44.437
Who else knows what you can do?

11:45.370 --> 11:47.806
No one.

11:47.839 --> 11:50.409
Stitches in my back
suggest otherwise.

11:51.177 --> 11:53.412
If you touch her,
I swear to God--

11:53.445 --> 11:54.680
You'll rip my arm off.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.582
Yeah, I've seen what you can do
when you're angry.

11:56.615 --> 11:58.283
This is my whole point.

11:58.316 --> 12:01.454
You want a life here?
You wanna survive this?
You need to listen to me.

12:02.921 --> 12:06.826
The people I work for
want what you have.

12:06.859 --> 12:10.129
It's only a matter of time
before they come for you.

12:10.162 --> 12:11.897
If that happens...

12:13.765 --> 12:15.534
it's not gonna work out well
for anyone.

12:15.568 --> 12:16.936
I promise you that.

12:20.239 --> 12:22.174
You should go.

12:22.207 --> 12:24.009
I need to take care
of a few things.

12:25.644 --> 12:27.913
[stammers]
I don't understand.

12:27.947 --> 12:29.882
I don't... [scoffs]

12:29.915 --> 12:32.485
[sighs] You're worried
about your mom, aren't you?

12:35.988 --> 12:37.790
I'll be back tonight.

12:45.230 --> 12:47.699
[Thomas] She's gotta
be somewhere.
She couldn't have gone far.

12:47.733 --> 12:49.401
-[Jenna] Yeah.
-[Thomas] They will find her.

12:49.435 --> 12:51.337
-[heart monitor beeping]
-Mom?

12:53.338 --> 12:54.740
Henry.

12:54.773 --> 12:57.476
Henry! Hey.

12:57.509 --> 13:00.212
[laughs] Oh.

13:00.245 --> 13:02.414
Oh, sorry. Sorry.

13:02.447 --> 13:03.748
[Cleo] Come here.

13:03.782 --> 13:05.551
-Baby, no, come here.
-[Henry] Sorry.

13:07.686 --> 13:10.823
Where did you go, baby?

13:10.856 --> 13:12.691
[softly]
I'm so, so sorry.

13:12.724 --> 13:14.559
No, shh.

13:14.592 --> 13:16.028
Let's give them a minute.

13:19.464 --> 13:21.267
I thought I lost you.

13:25.437 --> 13:27.439
I woke up and I was--

13:27.472 --> 13:30.275
I swore--

13:30.309 --> 13:33.245
I swore that he shot you,
that you stood in--

13:33.278 --> 13:37.048
In front of me, that you
stood in front of Bill.

13:37.082 --> 13:41.053
No, you pulled me back.
You were protecting me.

13:43.989 --> 13:47.125
Anna told me what you did.

13:47.158 --> 13:50.662
You jumped out of Bill's car.

13:50.696 --> 13:52.565
And you went and got help.

13:54.165 --> 13:56.335
That you're the reason
that I'm here.

14:04.910 --> 14:07.379
So I got a call from the
Lindermans this morning.

14:07.412 --> 14:10.782
They heard you trying
to sneak in last night drunk.

14:10.815 --> 14:12.584
What were you thinking,

14:12.617 --> 14:14.920
taking Henry to a party?

14:15.454 --> 14:17.155
She wanted to go.

14:17.189 --> 14:20.325
[stammers]
I thought that if I went with,
it would be okay.

14:20.358 --> 14:23.862
I don't expect Henry to know
what's best right now, you know?

14:23.896 --> 14:26.298
There's a lot going on.
But you?

14:26.899 --> 14:28.633
I expect better.

14:28.667 --> 14:30.069
I'm sorry.

14:30.602 --> 14:31.803
Just... [sighs]

14:31.837 --> 14:34.406
I need you to be the adult
in the room, 'kay?

14:34.439 --> 14:36.175
Especially now.

14:37.809 --> 14:40.546
Cleo's coming home tomorrow.

14:40.579 --> 14:42.514
I need your help.

14:42.548 --> 14:44.950
She just got out of surgery.
Is that a good idea?

14:44.984 --> 14:46.418
I don't know.

14:49.488 --> 14:51.657
Cleo's insurance lapsed.

14:51.690 --> 14:53.692
All of this
is out of pocket, 'kay?

14:53.725 --> 14:56.728
We don't have the bowling alley.
We have nothing coming in.

14:56.762 --> 14:58.364
We have to make this work.

14:59.831 --> 15:02.167
Listen.
I know this is asking a lot.

15:03.836 --> 15:08.040
[sighs]
When we brought Mom home,

15:08.507 --> 15:09.741
you stepped up.

15:09.775 --> 15:11.877
You made sure
that she was safe.

15:11.910 --> 15:14.613
I know that you can do this.

15:15.147 --> 15:17.483
'Kay? They need us.

15:24.289 --> 15:27.726
I should never have
taken that job.

15:27.760 --> 15:30.528
I should've seen
what was going on.

15:30.562 --> 15:32.197
You didn't know.

15:34.032 --> 15:36.302
I'm your mother.
It's my job to know.

15:38.837 --> 15:40.339
I'm gonna do better.

15:42.407 --> 15:43.709
I promise.

15:46.144 --> 15:48.480
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you.

15:59.658 --> 16:01.060
"Sheriff Frederick Dale.

16:01.093 --> 16:02.627
Husband. Father."

16:02.660 --> 16:04.396
[chuckling]
"Hero."

16:04.430 --> 16:07.065
Yeah, she wants me
to put that up in the station.

16:07.099 --> 16:09.101
She's been calling all morning.

16:09.134 --> 16:11.035
That's Karen for you.

16:11.069 --> 16:12.570
Probably not gonna let this go.

16:12.604 --> 16:14.606
Well, I'm not gonna pretend
Dale was a hero

16:14.639 --> 16:16.975
just because his wife
is some politician.

16:17.008 --> 16:18.243
Honestly?

16:18.277 --> 16:21.713
I'd consider the cost
before making a fuss.

16:21.746 --> 16:24.183
We all know the truth.

16:24.216 --> 16:26.418
You give her
this one little thing,

16:26.452 --> 16:28.120
it'll go a long way.

16:41.432 --> 16:44.802
So when exactly was the last
time you spoke with your dad?

16:44.836 --> 16:46.338
[Clay] Um,

16:47.639 --> 16:49.742
at the hospital, I guess,

16:49.775 --> 16:51.677
after the fire.

16:51.710 --> 16:54.146
And how was that?

16:54.179 --> 16:57.015
Was it a good conversation?

16:57.048 --> 16:58.584
What's that gotta do
with anything?

17:01.119 --> 17:04.423
I'm trying to understand
your dad's mindset that morning.

17:05.724 --> 17:08.060
And why it is he wanted
to speak with Henry Coles.

17:10.795 --> 17:12.564
Does that surprise you?

17:12.598 --> 17:14.766
That he went
to the Hope house for her?

17:14.800 --> 17:17.101
I don't know.

17:17.135 --> 17:18.737
Maybe he was scared.

17:19.971 --> 17:22.608
And why would he be scared
of Henry?

17:22.641 --> 17:24.843
Why don't you ask her?

17:24.876 --> 17:26.779
I'm asking you.

17:28.247 --> 17:31.316
Does this have anything
to do with your accident?

17:34.319 --> 17:36.021
'Cause I know Henry was
with you, and I know your dad--

17:36.054 --> 17:38.856
My dad didn't do shit to her.

17:38.890 --> 17:41.226
All right?

17:41.260 --> 17:43.862
We never did anything
to Henry Coles,

17:43.896 --> 17:46.598
so whatever she told you,
she's the one that hurts people.

17:48.834 --> 17:51.837
If you can't find my dad,
then she probably did something.

17:51.870 --> 17:55.507
She probably attacked him...
hurt him or some shit
like she did to me.

17:55.541 --> 17:58.343
Henry hurt you? How?

17:58.376 --> 18:01.546
What do you mean, how?
Look at me.

18:01.579 --> 18:04.516
-Clay, are you saying--
-I'm saying she crushed
my fucking truck.

18:04.549 --> 18:06.017
Okay?

18:06.051 --> 18:08.220
She crushed it from the inside.

18:09.187 --> 18:11.623
Crushed it?

18:11.656 --> 18:13.191
[sighs]

18:13.224 --> 18:15.327
-Forget it, forget it.
-[Wendy] That's enough.

18:15.360 --> 18:17.629
Clay's been through
enough, okay?

18:22.900 --> 18:25.370
-Uh--
-I'm sorry, Officer.

18:25.403 --> 18:27.873
Just this is an adjustment
for both of us.

18:29.274 --> 18:30.843
If Bill reaches out--

18:30.876 --> 18:32.511
Yeah, I will call you,
first thing.

18:36.882 --> 18:39.785
And Lucas?

18:39.818 --> 18:41.453
Are there any updates?

18:42.754 --> 18:44.556
No, nothing new.

18:44.589 --> 18:47.192
We're doing what we can
to track him down.

18:47.726 --> 18:48.727
Thank you.

18:52.263 --> 18:54.032
[Jeremiah]
Lucas Boone is alive?

18:54.065 --> 18:55.501
[Esther] For now, yes.

18:58.337 --> 19:00.305
He returned that...

19:01.339 --> 19:03.575
and the money you left behind.

19:06.678 --> 19:09.080
The money meant to free us
from the Boones.

19:09.113 --> 19:10.282
[sighs]

19:13.218 --> 19:17.189
I sought the Lord,
and he delivered us.

19:17.222 --> 19:18.656
You need to post bail

19:18.690 --> 19:21.860
and make arrangements
to secure my release.

19:28.166 --> 19:31.135
I know this has been
a challenging time.

19:31.169 --> 19:34.740
Once I'm free,
we will rebuild our community

19:35.807 --> 19:37.576
and our livelihood.

19:41.179 --> 19:44.249
[voice breaking]
We cannot rebuild what was lost.

19:50.555 --> 19:52.858
It is because of you
our son is dead.

20:01.066 --> 20:03.134
That is untrue.

20:03.167 --> 20:04.970
You promised to keep him safe,

20:05.003 --> 20:07.839
that the Lord would
watch over him.

20:07.872 --> 20:09.775
I did everything I could.

20:09.808 --> 20:11.944
You've... you've failed.

20:14.012 --> 20:16.314
You had that man and his
servants lined up before you,

20:16.348 --> 20:17.916
and still you did nothing.

20:17.949 --> 20:20.218
Bill Boone deceived me,

20:20.251 --> 20:21.920
and you know that.

20:22.721 --> 20:24.323
You were weak.

20:30.428 --> 20:32.931
You no longer know
what our community needs.

20:33.332 --> 20:36.435
[tense music]

20:37.235 --> 20:39.471
You are my wife.

20:45.343 --> 20:48.579
The money will remain
with the congregation.

20:48.613 --> 20:52.116
That is my decision
as leader of this Church.

20:52.150 --> 20:54.353
The Church will not follow you!

20:57.255 --> 20:58.824
Esther!

21:02.661 --> 21:05.096
-What kind of soup was it?
-Townes.

21:05.130 --> 21:08.834
Details matter, Jenna.
It can help us figure out
where he took her.

21:08.867 --> 21:10.669
[Henry] His name's Nikolai.

21:10.702 --> 21:13.138
That's what the cook
called him, anyway.

21:13.171 --> 21:15.206
'Kay, that's something.

21:15.240 --> 21:17.375
Okay, got it.
[sniffs]

21:17.408 --> 21:21.213
If your teleporter-mentor-guy
is the "they" the hacker
warned us about,

21:21.246 --> 21:22.880
this tape will have answers.

21:22.914 --> 21:25.717
-Who's "they"?
-Exactly.

21:25.751 --> 21:28.086
[Michael over TV]
<i> Hello, Dominick.</i>

21:28.119 --> 21:29.754
<i> My name's Michael Pearce.</i>

21:29.787 --> 21:31.723
<i> I'm one of
the researchers here.</i>

21:31.756 --> 21:33.224
<i> Is English okay?</i>

21:33.258 --> 21:35.127
<i> I'm afraid my French
is not so good.</i>

21:35.160 --> 21:37.662
<i> Are you part of the study?
For sleep?</i>

21:37.696 --> 21:40.498
<i> -Yes.
-How did you do this?</i>

21:40.531 --> 21:43.001
<i> It's perfect,
just like my room.</i>

21:43.034 --> 21:44.702
<i> I'm glad to hear it.</i>

21:44.735 --> 21:48.506
<i> My seizures are worse,
not better.</i>

21:48.539 --> 21:49.774
[Michael]
<i> I know you're frustrated,</i>

21:49.808 --> 21:52.610
<i> but we have something new
we'd like to try.</i>

21:52.643 --> 21:55.380
<i> I believe it'll help uncover
the cause of your seizures</i>

21:55.413 --> 21:57.315
<i> so we can better
target our treatment.</i>

21:57.348 --> 22:00.585
<i> If you wanna follow me to the
other room, we're all set up.</i>

22:01.419 --> 22:03.889
-Is that it?
-[door closes on tape]

22:03.922 --> 22:06.524
It's just a sleep study?

22:06.558 --> 22:10.194
Michael Pearce was the scientist
from the YouTube video.

22:10.227 --> 22:12.497
The guy whose body washed up?

22:12.530 --> 22:14.800
What?
What are you talking about?

22:14.833 --> 22:16.735
There's gotta be
something more here.

22:16.768 --> 22:20.037
[Townes] I'm going to google
Dominick Babtiste too.

22:20.071 --> 22:22.607
Hold on.
Just go back.

22:23.041 --> 22:25.210
[VCR whirring]

22:25.243 --> 22:26.978
Stop, stop, stop.

22:27.011 --> 22:29.014
[soft foreboding music]

22:29.047 --> 22:31.649
[soft, muffled shouting]

22:31.683 --> 22:34.786
Do you hear that?
Turn it up.

22:37.823 --> 22:40.559
[Dominick shouting
indistinctly]

22:42.526 --> 22:44.396
-[shouts]
-[whooshing]

22:46.297 --> 22:47.365
[speaking French]

22:47.399 --> 22:50.201
[softly]<i> Oh,
what's happening to me?</i>

22:50.234 --> 22:52.704
<i> I have to get out of here.</i>

22:54.272 --> 22:56.308
[banging on door]

22:56.341 --> 22:59.411
[Dominick shouting
desperately in French]

23:00.979 --> 23:02.847
Answer me!

23:02.880 --> 23:04.082
[screaming]

23:04.115 --> 23:05.784
[static buzzes]

23:07.685 --> 23:09.888
They tortured that kid.

23:09.921 --> 23:12.491
And then he teleported.

23:14.258 --> 23:16.561
Dominick Babtiste.

23:16.594 --> 23:18.830
He's the teleporter
from the subway video.

23:20.798 --> 23:22.734
[exhales]
It's both of them?

23:26.671 --> 23:29.574
-What does that mean?
-I don't know.

23:31.776 --> 23:34.846
-We need to talk to someone.
-You should show Nikolai
the video.

23:36.114 --> 23:37.682
-What?
-No.

23:37.716 --> 23:40.118
You can ask him if these are the
people who are coming for you.

23:40.151 --> 23:42.053
Townes, what planet are you on?
She can't trust him.

23:42.086 --> 23:44.755
But technically, everything
he's done has helped her.

23:44.789 --> 23:46.957
It's not just about me, Townes.

23:46.991 --> 23:49.161
I'm not the only one
we need to worry about.

23:51.830 --> 23:55.600
We need real help from someone
with real authority.

23:55.634 --> 23:57.602
It's the only way
to protect ourselves.

23:59.670 --> 24:01.740
We should talk
to Officer Hulce.

24:05.277 --> 24:07.679
And say what?

24:07.712 --> 24:10.515
We'll tell her that
Nikolai killed Bill Boone,

24:10.548 --> 24:13.851
and that you witnessed it.
If she arrests him--

24:13.885 --> 24:17.355
It won't make a difference.
You can't contain a teleporter.

24:17.388 --> 24:18.824
Clearly, they can.

24:19.190 --> 24:20.425
He escaped.

24:20.458 --> 24:22.594
Okay, then maybe
we could slow him down.

24:22.627 --> 24:25.763
I'm-- What else
are we going to do?

24:25.797 --> 24:28.066
He can take her
whenever he wants

24:28.099 --> 24:31.570
and deliver her to people
who will do God knows what.

24:34.405 --> 24:35.774
Sorry.

24:38.076 --> 24:39.911
No, you're right.

24:41.612 --> 24:43.548
We won't let that happen.

24:43.581 --> 24:47.018
But we can't stop it,
not really.

24:47.052 --> 24:49.086
Bill Boone's dead,
your mother was shot,

24:49.120 --> 24:52.123
and we don't know who Nikolai
or these other people are.

24:52.156 --> 24:54.059
We can't do this on our own.

24:57.395 --> 25:00.197
[phones ringing]

25:00.231 --> 25:03.134
[indistinct chatter]

25:05.403 --> 25:06.905
Townes won't come in.

25:10.275 --> 25:12.643
-I can't-- I can't do this.
-Hey.

25:12.677 --> 25:14.478
[whispers]
Hey, yes, you can.

25:14.512 --> 25:16.548
-[whispers] I can't.
-[overlapping dialogue]

25:16.581 --> 25:18.416
[Anna] But there aren't many
restaurants around here.

25:18.450 --> 25:20.552
-[Nikolai] I'll check it out.
-Jenna.

25:21.119 --> 25:22.587
Henry. Hi.

25:22.620 --> 25:25.290
Ken, this is Henry Coles
from the report.

25:25.323 --> 25:28.293
Henry, this is Ken Davidson.
He's an insurance adjustor.

25:28.326 --> 25:30.462
He manages
the Boone properties.

25:30.495 --> 25:33.297
Henry, what luck.

25:33.331 --> 25:37.168
Not to bug you, but I--
I have a few questions
about the accident.

25:37.202 --> 25:41.606
If you wouldn't mind,
uh, giving me a ring,

25:41.639 --> 25:43.642
you can reach me
at this number.

25:45.109 --> 25:47.211
Hi. Ken.

25:47.244 --> 25:49.681
-[Jenna] Jenna.
-[Nikolai]
Nice to meet you, Jenna.

25:51.815 --> 25:53.852
Did you girls wanna come back?

25:55.052 --> 25:56.621
Um...

25:57.555 --> 25:59.691
-Henry?
-Um...

26:01.826 --> 26:03.727
Well, I should be off.

26:03.761 --> 26:06.064
There's a weak cup of joe
with my name on it.

26:06.097 --> 26:08.066
-Fremont Street, you said?
-That's right, yeah.

26:09.767 --> 26:11.303
[Nikolai]
Pleasure to meet you both.

26:16.207 --> 26:17.342
You wanna talk?

26:26.317 --> 26:27.686
[phone tapping]

26:31.889 --> 26:33.792
-[sighs]
-[phone vibrates]

26:40.298 --> 26:42.400
[sighs softly]

26:42.434 --> 26:43.902
[phone vibrates]

26:52.910 --> 26:55.847
[camera shutter clicking]

27:00.852 --> 27:02.988
[Anna] Have you met him before?

27:04.755 --> 27:07.324
That insurance adjustor?

27:07.358 --> 27:08.627
No.

27:09.360 --> 27:10.828
Well, I'm glad you're here.

27:10.862 --> 27:13.865
I have a few more questions
if you're up for it.

27:13.898 --> 27:16.868
But first, what is it that
you wanted to talk to me about?

27:17.935 --> 27:21.873
I wanted to see if you had
any more information

27:21.906 --> 27:23.908
on Bill.

27:27.245 --> 27:31.316
Like, if you guys have--
have found him, or...

27:31.349 --> 27:34.786
There's nothing new,
but the minute that changes,
I will let you know.

27:37.254 --> 27:38.656
Is that it?

27:38.690 --> 27:40.425
[inhales deeply,
clicks tongue]

27:40.458 --> 27:41.726
I should go.

27:41.759 --> 27:43.962
You know, I-- I'm still
trying to piece together

27:43.995 --> 27:47.164
the events of yesterday
morning, and, um,

27:47.198 --> 27:50.235
I'm-- I'm struggling with your
story a little, to be honest.

27:52.536 --> 27:54.039
Okay.

27:57.375 --> 28:01.112
I'm-- I mean,
I told you everything
that I can remember.

28:01.145 --> 28:03.081
I spoke to Clay Boone
this morning.

28:06.717 --> 28:10.721
Is he the reason
Bill wanted to hurt you?

28:10.754 --> 28:13.457
I mean,
your mom seems to think so.

28:13.491 --> 28:16.727
Your mom said
Bill was convinced

28:16.761 --> 28:19.230
that you did something to Clay,

28:19.263 --> 28:22.399
and Clay seems to agree.

28:22.433 --> 28:24.102
He blamed you for the accident.

28:28.472 --> 28:32.643
What was the nature of your
relationship with Clay?

28:32.677 --> 28:34.312
Relationship?

28:35.580 --> 28:37.415
Did you two date?

28:38.115 --> 28:39.284
[firmly] No.

28:40.818 --> 28:42.487
So you just know each other
from school?

28:43.254 --> 28:44.722
Yeah, I'm-- I'm--
