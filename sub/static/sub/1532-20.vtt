00:02.160 --> 00:03.321
Previously on Arrow:

00:03.520 --> 00:06.000
These waters' powers,
they have permitted me...

00:06.160 --> 00:07.924
...to live way beyond my time.

00:08.200 --> 00:10.601
I want you to take my place.

00:11.400 --> 00:14.210
I want you to become
the next Ra's al Ghul.

00:14.440 --> 00:17.523
If you insist on pursuing
this path of resistance...

00:17.720 --> 00:20.121
...there will be consequences.
Is that a threat?

00:22.320 --> 00:23.446
I'm the Demon's Head.

00:23.600 --> 00:24.726
Very soon...

00:25.040 --> 00:27.805
...your brother...
He will never take your place.

00:28.040 --> 00:29.371
He Will.

01:05.840 --> 01:07.126
Thea?

01:08.960 --> 01:10.644
Thea? Oh, my God.

01:11.160 --> 01:12.366
Thea.

01:21.680 --> 01:23.170
I couldn't stop him.

01:23.360 --> 01:25.806
I need an ambulance
at 455 Merced, Unit 10.

01:26.120 --> 01:27.645
Please hurry.

01:28.280 --> 01:32.080
All right. You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

01:33.240 --> 01:35.846
No, Thea, stay awake. Come on.

01:40.800 --> 01:43.007
- Hang on. Almost there.
- How long was she like this?

01:43.200 --> 01:45.601
- I don't know. I just found her.
- You need to stay here.

01:45.760 --> 01:48.127
- I'm not gonna leave her.
- You need to let us work.

01:50.600 --> 01:52.011
Get me a set of vitals.

01:52.200 --> 01:53.406
Lift.

01:54.960 --> 01:57.361
- Charge up to 200 joules.
- Charging.

02:00.320 --> 02:01.367
Transfer lines.

02:01.520 --> 02:03.488
- Clear.
- No response.

02:03.680 --> 02:05.967
Draw up 1 milligram epi.
Charge to 200.

02:06.160 --> 02:08.366
Charging. Ready.

02:08.560 --> 02:09.890
Clear.

02:10.039 --> 02:12.646
Asystole. No pulse.

02:13.160 --> 02:14.491
- Start CPR.
- Yes, doctor.

02:16.080 --> 02:18.128
- Pulse ox at 78.
- Come on.

02:20.520 --> 02:21.567
Come on. Stay with us.

02:22.480 --> 02:23.606
Come on.

02:24.720 --> 02:27.007
Come on, come on.

02:57.440 --> 02:59.761
We did the best we could
under the circumstances...

02:59.960 --> 03:02.531
...but her injuries were extensive.

03:02.720 --> 03:05.291
Even if she were to regain consciousness...

03:05.520 --> 03:08.524
We can prolong her life
for as long as you wish...

03:08.680 --> 03:11.001
...but it might be best
to consider other options.

03:14.120 --> 03:16.202
I am truly sorry, Mr. Queen.

03:20.240 --> 03:21.366
May I see her?

03:57.720 --> 03:59.563
I'm sorry.

04:03.400 --> 04:05.004
Oliver.

04:22.280 --> 04:23.884
Thea.

04:34.040 --> 04:35.280
What are they doing?

04:36.160 --> 04:37.605
They're unloading the truck.

04:37.800 --> 04:39.211
And, uh...

04:39.520 --> 04:40.567
...having dinner.

04:41.080 --> 04:43.048
General Shrieve is there.

04:45.480 --> 04:48.131
The Alpha, the Omega.
He's combining them.

04:57.320 --> 04:58.401
The bioweapon is armed.

04:58.600 --> 05:01.331
- What happens now?
- He'll take it somewhere to be released.

05:01.480 --> 05:04.051
Somewhere densely populated
where it'll have the most impact.

05:04.240 --> 05:06.402
We need to stop that truck.

05:06.800 --> 05:07.881
Where's Oliver?

05:09.480 --> 05:11.403
- Come on.
- You stole a car?

05:11.600 --> 05:13.045
I borrowed it. Come on.

05:25.480 --> 05:27.130
Oh, my God.

05:27.360 --> 05:28.930
Oliver.

05:30.160 --> 05:32.561
Oliver, we came as soon as we could.
What happened?

05:34.680 --> 05:35.727
Oliver?

05:36.400 --> 05:38.641
They just left her there...

05:39.760 --> 05:41.171
...to die.

05:41.400 --> 05:43.767
Oliver, is she...?

05:44.200 --> 05:45.770
It's bad.

05:57.800 --> 05:59.404
What is it?

06:00.280 --> 06:02.089
Smoke.

06:02.440 --> 06:03.521
The League?

06:05.440 --> 06:08.171
Screw them,
at least until we get our bearings, Oliver.

06:08.760 --> 06:09.807
Come up with a plan.

06:09.960 --> 06:11.371
He's won.

06:12.240 --> 06:14.288
There is no plan.

06:15.120 --> 06:16.929
Stay here with Thea.

06:18.720 --> 06:20.165
Did you do this?

06:20.400 --> 06:21.686
Did you do this?

06:25.320 --> 06:26.606
You could still save her.

06:26.960 --> 06:30.089
- I don't understand.
- Take your place as Heir to the Demon...

06:31.480 --> 06:33.687
...and Ra's al Ghul
will bring your sister back.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.968
- What's going on?
- Where are you going?

06:48.480 --> 06:50.289
- Away.
- You can't just leave.

06:50.440 --> 06:53.489
- Tell us what's happening.
- There's a way for me to save her.

06:53.720 --> 06:54.767
Thea?

06:55.400 --> 06:57.926
- Oliver, that's not possible.
- Yes, it is.

06:59.600 --> 07:02.126
There are waters in Nanda Parbat.

07:02.480 --> 07:05.484
They've permitted Ra's to live
for over a hundred years.

07:07.360 --> 07:09.169
And in rare instances...

07:09.360 --> 07:13.365
...told in legend, those waters have been
used to restore the dead to life.

07:15.360 --> 07:18.045
He offered to use the Lazarus Pit on Thea,
didn't he?

07:18.600 --> 07:20.967
Lazarus, as in from the Bible, Lazarus?

07:21.240 --> 07:23.447
The pit's real. I've seen it.

07:24.320 --> 07:25.367
It can save Thea.

07:25.520 --> 07:28.000
Right. But only if you become the new Ra's.

07:29.120 --> 07:33.011
Okay, well, even if a magic hot
tub were not crazy talk...

07:33.160 --> 07:36.289
...we're not gonna let you join
the League of Psychotic Murderers...

07:36.440 --> 07:39.808
...even if it is to save Thea.
Which this wouldn't.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.162
The waters change a person.

07:42.720 --> 07:44.051
In the soul.

07:44.400 --> 07:46.641
Even if they work,
the Thea you get back...

07:46.840 --> 07:48.365
...will not be the one you lost.

07:48.560 --> 07:50.801
The one we lost because of you.

07:53.880 --> 07:55.564
- Oliver.
- I'd prefer that we didn't do...

07:55.720 --> 07:58.963
...our usual "please don't go" dance.
We not going to. I'm coming with you.

07:59.360 --> 08:01.567
Assuming that this works...

08:01.760 --> 08:04.286
...someone's going to need to bring Thea
back home.

08:05.560 --> 08:07.324
We need a way to get to Nanda Parbat.

08:18.720 --> 08:19.767
Sorry to interrupt.

08:24.360 --> 08:25.441
Everything all right?

08:25.680 --> 08:28.411
Because you got that crease
between your eyebrows...

08:28.600 --> 08:30.921
...that tells me things most definitely
are not.

08:31.760 --> 08:34.604
Something awful has happened.

08:35.080 --> 08:36.808
And I need a favor.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.207
A really big favor.

08:39.400 --> 08:42.688
Last time you asked for a big favor,
I had to loan you my helicopter.

08:42.880 --> 08:45.042
I don't need your helicopter.

08:45.800 --> 08:46.847
I need your jet.

08:48.360 --> 08:50.727
Well, Oliver does. But both of us.

08:51.560 --> 08:53.927
It's not what you think.

08:54.120 --> 08:56.771
Well, if you're gonna fly away with him...

08:56.920 --> 08:59.127
...then it's exactly what I think.
Ray.

08:59.440 --> 09:02.967
Last night was a bit of an eye-opener.

09:04.400 --> 09:07.927
Insofar as realizing something...

09:08.120 --> 09:11.567
...you should have realized
a long time ago...

09:12.480 --> 09:14.721
...could be considered eye-opening.

09:15.040 --> 09:17.646
Last night,
when you were saying goodbye to Roy...

09:17.880 --> 09:19.928
...you and Oliver...

09:24.000 --> 09:26.002
You still have feelings for him.

09:27.160 --> 09:29.003
When I...

09:29.480 --> 09:32.404
...told you that I loved you
at the hospital...

09:32.560 --> 09:34.324
...you responded with Jell-O.

09:36.160 --> 09:38.811
Seeing you two together last night...

09:39.080 --> 09:40.809
...I realized...

09:41.760 --> 09:45.287
...you don't love me
because you're in love with him.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.490
I'm sorry.

09:52.080 --> 09:54.162
You're the last person
I ever meant to hurt.

09:58.640 --> 10:00.369
Take the jet.

10:01.680 --> 10:03.808
I hope the "something awful"...

10:04.040 --> 10:05.201
...stops being awful.

10:14.880 --> 10:16.450
What did Felicity say to Dr. Vaca?

10:16.600 --> 10:19.206
She thinks Thea's being moved
to Central City.

10:19.440 --> 10:21.966
You know, they do amazing things
at S.T.A.R. Labs.

10:22.160 --> 10:26.404
Think about paying them a visit before
putting Thea on a flight to Nanda Parbat.

10:26.600 --> 10:29.126
S.T.A.R. Labs can't save her.
Only the Lazarus Pit can.

10:29.320 --> 10:30.890
Oliver.

10:33.440 --> 10:35.044
Look, I know what I have done...

10:35.200 --> 10:39.330
...doesn't seem like the actions
of a loving father, but I do love her.

10:39.520 --> 10:41.443
She's the only child I have left.

10:42.360 --> 10:43.725
Having said that...

10:43.960 --> 10:47.407
...I would rather lose her forever
than subject her to the pit.

10:49.240 --> 10:50.924
Get on the plane, Malcolm.

11:06.080 --> 11:08.242
- You look chilly.
- Yeah.

11:08.400 --> 11:09.811
Hm.

11:14.920 --> 11:16.729
Thanks for letting me be here for you.

11:18.440 --> 11:19.601
You're welcome.

11:21.840 --> 11:25.049
- I didn't have much of a choice, did I?
- No.

11:25.440 --> 11:28.410
I wanted to make you think
you had grown a little as a person.

11:32.280 --> 11:35.602
I know that I've only told you a little...

11:36.680 --> 11:38.603
...about the five years that I was away.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.890
Well, if by a little,
you mean hardly anything.

11:42.200 --> 11:44.646
I came back to Starling City...

11:45.240 --> 11:49.006
...before they found me on the island.

11:49.640 --> 11:51.369
I don't understand.

11:52.240 --> 11:53.765
It was complicated.

11:55.760 --> 11:57.649
I saw Thea.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.445
She didn't see me.

12:01.760 --> 12:03.762
She had a drug problem.

12:05.640 --> 12:07.404
Sol...

12:07.720 --> 12:09.529
...confronted her dealer.

12:11.040 --> 12:13.281
And I broke his neck.

12:13.640 --> 12:16.450
And I did it because I was angry. Sure.

12:17.440 --> 12:21.240
But I also did it
because I felt like I was protecting her.

12:26.560 --> 12:29.769
All I've ever wanted to do
was protect her.

12:31.840 --> 12:33.683
Malcolm told me.

12:33.840 --> 12:36.844
He warned me what Ra's might do.

12:38.440 --> 12:39.851
But I never thought...

12:45.040 --> 12:46.883
I failed.

13:02.480 --> 13:04.847
- You got that?
- I got it.

13:14.480 --> 13:15.527
Incoming.

13:32.880 --> 13:33.961
Maseo, take the wheel.

14:16.520 --> 14:18.602
You looked like you could use a hand.

14:39.080 --> 14:40.809
It's not in here.

14:43.480 --> 14:45.642
What is that?

14:48.280 --> 14:49.327
It's the League.

15:12.440 --> 15:14.920
Welcome home, Al Sah-him.

15:39.440 --> 15:42.046
I must prepare her for the ritual.

15:51.840 --> 15:53.808
I'll treat her as my own family.

16:13.400 --> 16:16.051
I hope you find the accommodations
acceptable.

16:17.840 --> 16:20.889
Such luxury is a small glimpse
of the life that awaits Oliver.

16:21.080 --> 16:22.730
Trying to reassure me or yourself?

16:22.880 --> 16:25.201
- I don't know what you mean.
- You're Oliver's friend.

16:25.840 --> 16:27.046
Maseo, right?

16:27.640 --> 16:28.926
I am Sarab.

16:29.560 --> 16:31.642
Call yourself whatever you want.

16:31.840 --> 16:35.731
If you gave a damn, you wouldn't work for
the man who practically killed his sister.

16:35.920 --> 16:37.524
Oliver will be spared grief...

16:38.200 --> 16:40.771
...in a manner that was denied to me.

16:40.920 --> 16:43.844
And he will receive an honor
greater than you can imagine.

16:46.280 --> 16:47.406
League of Assassins.

16:48.600 --> 16:51.410
You're feared for your bravery...

16:51.920 --> 16:53.570
...and power.

16:53.760 --> 16:57.446
But all I see are a bunch of weak men
running from their lives.

16:57.600 --> 16:59.602
Trying to escape.

17:00.120 --> 17:02.202
That's not powerful, Maseo...

17:02.400 --> 17:03.561
...or brave.

17:03.720 --> 17:04.767
It's cowardly.

17:06.960 --> 17:08.564
Do not presume to know me.

17:08.760 --> 17:11.525
Until you've held your dying child
in your arms...

17:12.599 --> 17:15.968
...until you've told him
everything would be okay...

17:16.359 --> 17:19.842
...so that the last words he ever hears...

17:20.800 --> 17:21.925
...are a lie...

17:24.319 --> 17:25.890
...you know nothing.

17:26.720 --> 17:28.404
I'm sorry.

17:30.560 --> 17:32.449
What was your child's name?

17:33.880 --> 17:35.120
Akio.

17:35.480 --> 17:38.450
You think Akio would be proud
of his father right now?

18:54.880 --> 18:56.370
Thea.

18:57.280 --> 18:58.566
Thea.

19:07.880 --> 19:09.882
I've fulfilled my end
of our arrangement.

19:11.480 --> 19:13.687
I suggest
you begin to make peace with yours.

19:20.240 --> 19:23.767
Hey. Hey. It's okay. You're okay.

19:24.360 --> 19:25.725
I don't know you.

19:29.400 --> 19:31.562
Thea, it's me.

19:31.760 --> 19:34.127
- It's Ollie.
- Ollie's dead.

19:36.760 --> 19:38.524
Dad?

19:38.800 --> 19:40.768
I'm here, Thea. It's me.

19:42.880 --> 19:44.803
What's going on?

19:45.320 --> 19:46.560
Where am I?

19:46.760 --> 19:48.171
Someplace safe.

19:48.880 --> 19:50.405
You are safe.

19:50.600 --> 19:52.090
Where's Mom?

19:55.760 --> 19:57.091
Your mother's not here.

19:57.600 --> 19:58.647
Look...

19:59.160 --> 20:02.767
...just lie back, close your eyes,
and get some rest, okay?

20:02.960 --> 20:04.564
I love you, Dad.

20:14.960 --> 20:17.122
Ra's told me that the confusion would pass.

20:17.360 --> 20:20.569
- You have no idea what you've done.
- What I've done?

20:21.320 --> 20:24.927
She's alive, Malcolm.
What I did saved her life.

20:25.160 --> 20:26.650
She thinks Moira's still alive.

20:26.800 --> 20:28.529
- She'll be fine.
- You don't know that.

20:28.680 --> 20:32.127
Yes, I do. Because you, Diggle
and Felicity are gonna take her home...

20:32.320 --> 20:35.085
...and she will recover.
And what is that worth?

20:37.320 --> 20:41.166
- Felicity...
- No, this is wrong. It is just wrong.

20:46.960 --> 20:50.009
I need to talk to you.
What is happening here is perverse.

20:50.160 --> 20:51.571
What you're doing to Oliver...

20:51.720 --> 20:54.530
...what you're making him do,
I'm not going to let it happen.

20:58.400 --> 21:00.528
You can leave us.

21:05.720 --> 21:08.246
You have a great fire within you.

21:09.520 --> 21:13.206
- I can see now why Oliver loves you.
- If you knew the first thing about love...

21:13.360 --> 21:15.840
...you would not be ripping Oliver
away from his family.

21:16.040 --> 21:18.122
I am merely helping him
fulfill his destiny.

21:18.320 --> 21:21.130
Yeah, I know all about
the "survive my sword" prophecy.

21:21.320 --> 21:24.051
And I'm here to tell you
that I could really give a crap.

21:24.880 --> 21:28.327
Me, and John, and God help me, Malcolm,
are not gonna let this happen.

21:28.520 --> 21:31.888
We have friends and resources
and we will go to war to get Oliver back.

21:32.680 --> 21:35.251
You know, many lifetimes ago...

21:35.880 --> 21:39.009
...I loved a woman immeasurably...

21:39.200 --> 21:41.248
...and she loved me.

21:43.720 --> 21:45.563
We had a son...

21:45.760 --> 21:47.888
...and then a daughter...

21:48.440 --> 21:53.446
...and for many years, I felt
I was the most fortunate man in the world.

21:53.680 --> 21:56.081
My life was bliss.

21:57.080 --> 22:00.721
And then one night a man came to my door
and he gave me a horrible choice.

22:01.960 --> 22:04.804
To leave without saying a word to them...

22:05.560 --> 22:08.404
...or to stand and watch them
tortured and then killed.

22:09.920 --> 22:12.526
And I left without a farewell.

22:13.080 --> 22:15.606
And to spare them pain...

22:16.360 --> 22:19.250
...I endured an agony worse than death.

22:19.480 --> 22:21.482
Sounds like you gave up too easily.

22:21.880 --> 22:24.929
There's one immutable truth about life:

22:26.680 --> 22:28.762
It is often more cruel than it is fair.

22:28.920 --> 22:32.481
It rarely provides an opportunity
for any of us to find closure.

22:35.800 --> 22:37.245
And all your posturing...

22:38.240 --> 22:39.765
...and all your threats of war...

22:40.760 --> 22:42.603
...they merely delay the inevitable...

22:42.800 --> 22:46.691
...causing you to forfeit
the opportunity you have...

22:48.320 --> 22:50.129
...which was denied me.

22:52.280 --> 22:54.647
You need to tell Oliver goodbye.

22:56.320 --> 22:58.243
Tell him how much you love him.

23:00.520 --> 23:04.650
Tell him whatever it is
your heart needs to express.

23:05.440 --> 23:07.329
And do it now...

23:09.360 --> 23:11.647
...before he is lost to you forever.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.331
Yeah?

23:31.840 --> 23:34.684
- Hey.
- Hey.

23:34.840 --> 23:38.686
You okay? I'm sorry,
that was a stupid question, you...

23:38.840 --> 23:41.161
You just saw your sister
come back from being dead...

23:41.320 --> 23:43.721
...and you're about to give up
everything you love...

23:43.880 --> 23:46.008
...so you're probably not.

23:46.240 --> 23:51.007
I remember the first time
that I thought I'd never see Thea again.

23:51.360 --> 23:53.203
When my father's boat went down.

23:53.480 --> 23:55.528
But you did see her again.

23:57.680 --> 23:59.045
And you'll see her again...

24:00.640 --> 24:03.166
...again.
This is different.

24:03.840 --> 24:05.365
Just been thinking about the...

24:07.320 --> 24:08.651
...person I was...

24:08.840 --> 24:10.285
...the brother that I was...

24:11.160 --> 24:15.165
...and how he probably died
when that boat went down.

24:15.360 --> 24:19.285
All this time,
I've been struggling with who I am.

24:19.480 --> 24:22.927
You think who you're supposed to be...

24:24.280 --> 24:25.850
...is the next Ra's al Ghul?

24:28.000 --> 24:29.729
Honestly?

24:31.000 --> 24:32.331
I don't know.

24:34.240 --> 24:37.528
The only thing I can know for sure
is that everything that I've done...

24:37.720 --> 24:39.563
...everything that happened...

24:39.800 --> 24:43.964
...it led me right here to this moment.

24:45.520 --> 24:47.249
And, Felicity, if that's true...

24:47.400 --> 24:50.722
...then I don't know what it was all for.

24:50.920 --> 24:52.524
I do.

24:57.240 --> 25:00.961
I wish that I could change your mind
about staying here...

25:02.320 --> 25:03.924
...but I know I can't.

25:05.240 --> 25:08.767
Just like I know how leaving you here
is going to destroy me.

25:09.960 --> 25:11.610
I don't regret a single moment.

25:13.920 --> 25:15.604
And you shouldn't either.

25:16.360 --> 25:18.044
You have done so much.

25:18.280 --> 25:21.648
You have saved so many people's lives.

25:21.880 --> 25:24.281
And you have changed so many
for the better...

25:26.280 --> 25:27.645
...including mine.

25:29.440 --> 25:31.283
Knowing you has changed my life.

25:31.440 --> 25:34.125
You opened up my heart...

25:34.360 --> 25:38.285
...in a way I didn't
even know was possible.

25:40.920 --> 25:42.888
I love you.

27:11.960 --> 27:14.884
We searched the whole truck.
There's nothing in there.

27:22.760 --> 27:24.046
Where is the bioweapon?

27:30.120 --> 27:32.282
Don't make me ask again.

27:36.560 --> 27:38.767
Food cart. It's in the food cart.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.764
Where is the food cart?

27:40.920 --> 27:43.764
We should split up to cover more ground.

27:45.760 --> 27:48.570
What's wrong?
I know you don't think we should do this.

27:48.720 --> 27:51.200
You decided
we should set an example for our son.

27:51.400 --> 27:54.085
And for ourselves.
We can't just let people die.

27:54.240 --> 27:58.245
If we do, we are just a shell.
Not really alive at all.

28:03.760 --> 28:05.922
So that happened.

28:10.120 --> 28:12.964
- I'm glad it did.
- Me too.

28:17.080 --> 28:19.606
- Heh-heh.
- What's this?

28:19.960 --> 28:22.122
If there's any kind of God...

28:22.280 --> 28:26.763
...something alcoholic.

28:33.560 --> 28:35.324
Not much to toast to up here, is there?

28:35.560 --> 28:36.971
Oh.

28:37.920 --> 28:39.649
There's us.

28:42.800 --> 28:44.325
Yeah.

28:46.480 --> 28:47.561
I'm sorry.

28:49.720 --> 28:52.564
I know there's no way of avoiding this,
of getting out of here...

28:52.760 --> 28:55.491
...of going someplace
where Ra's can't find us, but I...

28:55.680 --> 28:57.569
Felicity...

29:00.640 --> 29:02.483
Felicity.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.843
What did you...?

29:06.080 --> 29:07.570
I can't lose you.

29:10.320 --> 29:11.810
I won't.

29:16.640 --> 29:19.120
I stole some of the powder
that priest used on Thea.

29:19.280 --> 29:21.851
I wasn't sure what I was gonna do
when I got it, but...

29:22.080 --> 29:24.606
Yeah, how did you know
you were gonna lose your mind?

29:24.800 --> 29:26.529
Or commit suicide.

29:27.400 --> 29:30.688
Was your plan to sneak Ra's prize out
unconscious without getting us killed?

29:30.840 --> 29:32.888
I know it's an insane idea,
but I couldn't do it.

29:33.160 --> 29:34.685
I couldn't leave him.

29:37.200 --> 29:40.886
- We have to get him out of here.
- Felicity, this place is like a fortress.

29:41.120 --> 29:44.010
There's no way we're getting Oliver out
without Ra's knowing.

29:44.200 --> 29:46.009
We can't. But you can.

29:46.200 --> 29:49.682
- If we get caught, he'll kill all of us.
- Then we can't get caught.

29:50.200 --> 29:54.364
I've seen enough movies to know that the
scary fortress always has a secret exit.

29:54.560 --> 29:58.326
You were Ra's' right-hand stooge for years.
If anyone knows the way out, it's you.

29:58.520 --> 30:01.763
- So don't even try to play games with me.
- The catacombs.

30:02.720 --> 30:06.008
It's rough terrain.
It is not gonna be easy.

30:06.240 --> 30:08.288
- How do we get there?
- Through the temple.

30:08.520 --> 30:10.409
Go get Thea.
Meet us here in five minutes.

30:11.720 --> 30:12.767
Go.

30:19.080 --> 30:21.924
- Which way?
- Temple's this way. Come on.

30:58.600 --> 31:02.321
- There's not much time. Hurry.
- Why are you helping us?

31:02.560 --> 31:07.122
Because if I don't, then I am just a shell.
You reminded me of that.

31:08.800 --> 31:11.565
Thirty meters down, the path forks.

31:11.800 --> 31:14.087
- Take the left passage.
- Come on.

31:17.640 --> 31:21.122
These tunnels are centuries old.
Stay close.

31:21.280 --> 31:24.284
- You need to stop and rest for a minute?
- No.

31:24.520 --> 31:26.727
Maseo said stay left.

31:29.280 --> 31:31.362
- Thea?
- No.

31:31.840 --> 31:36.482
- No, no. No.
- We have to move. Now.

31:36.640 --> 31:38.642
Too late.

31:41.760 --> 31:45.048
Believe me,
we do not want to be taken alive.

31:45.520 --> 31:46.646
Hold.

31:48.000 --> 31:52.369
I am Al Sah-him. Wah-reeth al Ghul...

31:52.600 --> 31:55.285
...Heir to the Demon, and you will obey.

31:56.800 --> 31:58.802
Put your weapons down.

31:59.840 --> 32:01.330
Now.

32:02.760 --> 32:04.569
Tell Ra's I will return shortly.

32:11.160 --> 32:13.049
Oliver, please.

32:15.040 --> 32:17.327
Thank you for trying.

32:18.640 --> 32:20.085
I love you all the more for it.

32:22.840 --> 32:24.365
But this only ends one way.

32:31.840 --> 32:33.365
This is as far as I go.

32:34.160 --> 32:37.369
- The jet's less than a mile away.
- Where are we gonna fly to?

32:37.520 --> 32:39.170
I don't understand.

32:44.320 --> 32:46.049
Malcolm is gonna take you home.

32:48.200 --> 32:49.850
Aren't you coming with?

32:50.040 --> 32:51.610
Not now.

32:52.880 --> 32:54.211
You go on, I'll catch up.

32:56.560 --> 32:57.891
I love you, Thea.

32:59.520 --> 33:01.727
Don't ever forget that, okay?

33:10.320 --> 33:12.049
Oliver...

33:12.960 --> 33:15.088
Oliver, I don't know what to say.

33:17.520 --> 33:19.329
I do.

33:20.920 --> 33:22.922
John, you're the best man I've ever known.

33:25.840 --> 33:27.604
Whatever happens...

33:27.840 --> 33:29.842
...you're my brother.

33:45.880 --> 33:48.611
I'm afraid I will never forgive myself
for leaving you here.

33:48.760 --> 33:50.922
You told me once...

33:51.280 --> 33:53.089
...that life is precious.

33:55.280 --> 33:57.442
And that you wanted more
than I could offer you.

34:00.400 --> 34:01.811
Don't give up on that.

34:03.440 --> 34:06.364
The only way that I'm gonna survive this...

34:07.680 --> 34:09.887
...is if I know that you're out there...

34:10.080 --> 34:12.889
...living your life, happy.

34:18.120 --> 34:22.523
We're always saying goodbye to each other.
You'd think I'd be good at it by now.

34:29.480 --> 34:32.290
Well, let's not say goodbye this time.

35:16.040 --> 35:18.361
What...? What's going on?

35:18.520 --> 35:21.046
Everything's fine, Thea. You're okay.

35:22.720 --> 35:24.165
If you're here, then I'm not.

35:25.160 --> 35:27.561
At least you're feeling
more like yourself again.

35:29.880 --> 35:31.245
What do you want?

35:32.840 --> 35:33.887
Where's Ollie?

35:34.040 --> 35:37.010
Thea, do you remember anything
about the past few days?

35:39.400 --> 35:42.563
I... I was here.

35:43.200 --> 35:45.009
And Ra's, he...

35:45.240 --> 35:50.087
- He attacked me.
- No, Thea. He nearly killed you.

35:50.280 --> 35:54.080
- Where is my brother?
- That is... That is what I'm trying to explain.

35:55.520 --> 35:58.922
To save you, Oliver had to join the League.

35:59.760 --> 36:02.764
- He... He traded his life for yours.
- No.

36:03.560 --> 36:05.085
No.

36:06.080 --> 36:07.127
I am sorry.

36:07.280 --> 36:09.442
I know you hate me,
and you have every right...

36:09.640 --> 36:11.927
...but I'm gonna make up for that,
for everything.

36:12.080 --> 36:14.287
- That's not possible.
- Yes, it is.

36:14.560 --> 36:18.246
The League isn't after us anymore.
I am free.

36:19.320 --> 36:22.767
I could go anywhere in the world,
but this is where I want to be.

36:22.920 --> 36:25.400
Here, with my daughter.

36:26.920 --> 36:30.083
You took care of me when I was injured.
Now, please, Thea, please...

36:30.240 --> 36:32.129
...let me take care of you.

36:38.240 --> 36:40.049
Sorry to interrupt.

36:40.800 --> 36:45.647
- Is everything all right?
- No, it's not.

36:48.280 --> 36:51.443
- Felicity?
- Oliver's...

36:53.920 --> 36:55.251
He's gone.

36:55.800 --> 36:58.280
- What are you talking about?
- He joined the League.

36:59.640 --> 37:01.369
He's not coming back.

37:01.520 --> 37:02.885
Shh.

37:11.160 --> 37:14.482
Blood has been shed. League blood.

37:15.480 --> 37:18.484
And that is a transgression
punishable by death.

37:19.320 --> 37:22.164
And yet you allowed your friends
safe passage home.

37:22.320 --> 37:24.641
Tell me why
I should not hunt these people down...

37:24.840 --> 37:26.683
...and stain my blade with their blood.

37:26.880 --> 37:28.484
Because I stayed.

37:29.960 --> 37:31.325
I'm honoring our agreement.

37:31.480 --> 37:34.370
Now no one close to me
will ever be harmed again.

37:34.640 --> 37:38.645
And your allies would not have been able
to escape through the catacombs...

37:38.840 --> 37:41.844
...without assistance,
so you tell me who aided you...

37:42.000 --> 37:43.729
...who this traitor is.

37:43.960 --> 37:45.849
- I don't know.
- Me.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.731
I struck down three of our number.

38:00.040 --> 38:02.202
For my betrayal...

38:06.880 --> 38:08.882
...I offer you my life.

38:16.720 --> 38:18.449
You did not betray me tonight, Sarab.

38:18.680 --> 38:21.126
Maseo Yamashiro did.

38:23.000 --> 38:26.129
For a moment, your old life took hold...

38:26.360 --> 38:29.887
...but by coming here and kneeling
before me, you have proven your loyalty.

38:30.160 --> 38:33.562
And I will not spill Sarab's blood
for Mase0's actions.

38:33.760 --> 38:35.410
Stand up.

38:37.440 --> 38:39.920
Your service will be vital
in the coming weeks.

38:41.080 --> 38:43.765
Oliver will need you for
his transformation.

38:46.760 --> 38:48.250
And like Sarab...

38:50.080 --> 38:52.765
...vestiges of your old
identity still remain.

38:53.120 --> 38:56.920
Oliver Queen must be extinguished
from memory.

39:13.200 --> 39:14.690
StOp!

39:34.320 --> 39:35.606
Give me the vial.

40:18.840 --> 40:23.767
The word "assassin" has fallen victim
to many abuses of language...

40:24.320 --> 40:26.891
...its real meaning hidden
beneath a sediment...

40:27.120 --> 40:30.010
...of lies and falsehoods.

40:30.280 --> 40:33.762
In truth, "assassin"
comes from hashishiyya...

40:33.960 --> 40:37.009
...which means
"those who stand apart from society."

40:37.960 --> 40:39.530
Now...

40:39.680 --> 40:44.004
...every man and woman in here
have renounced their past life...

40:44.200 --> 40:47.647
...and forfeited their identity
in the name of something new.

40:47.880 --> 40:52.727
And it is a cleansing
only achieved by fire.

40:59.880 --> 41:01.370
Embrace the pain...

41:01.600 --> 41:06.083
...for it is your soul
finally being unburdened.

41:34.200 --> 41:36.601
Oliver Queen is dead...

41:37.400 --> 41:40.404
...eventually to be reborn as Ra's al Ghul.

41:41.360 --> 41:44.250
And for now, only the Arrow...

41:44.400 --> 41:46.971
...Al Sah-him, shall remain.

41:48.080 --> 41:50.242
Al Sah-him...

41:50.880 --> 41:53.281
...Heir to the Demon.
