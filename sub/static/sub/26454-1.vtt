00:57.898 --> 01:00.565
(BLEATING) What a
day, just beautiful.

01:00.567 --> 01:02.233
Don't you find Marvin?

01:02.235 --> 01:05.638
Moo-nificent Garry,
just moo-nificent.

01:07.674 --> 01:11.743
(BLEATING) Breathe in that
country air, will you Marvin?

01:11.745 --> 01:15.916
Moo, smell that whiff of
freshly mowed grass Garry.

01:17.418 --> 01:19.651
Listen to those buzzing bees.

01:19.653 --> 01:21.822
Watch the fluffy clouds.

01:22.790 --> 01:24.823
What a grand day.

01:24.825 --> 01:29.193
Mmm, just the perfect
Easter day in the country.

01:29.195 --> 01:30.030
Weehoo!

01:32.933 --> 01:36.401
My oh my, I'm on
an Easter egg hunt,

01:36.403 --> 01:38.669
but not just any
Easter egg hunt,

01:38.671 --> 01:41.373
it's the hunt for
a precious egg,

01:41.375 --> 01:45.278
the most precious Easter
egg that ever existed.

01:46.245 --> 01:48.312
Why is it so special?

01:48.314 --> 01:52.251
Because inside it hides
the greatest of prizes.

01:53.387 --> 01:54.221
My oh my.

01:56.055 --> 01:57.755
Say Garry.

01:57.757 --> 01:59.257
What is it Marvin?

01:59.259 --> 02:02.794
Isn't something missing
from this Easter day?

02:02.796 --> 02:04.129
I don't know.

02:04.131 --> 02:05.597
Do you reckon?

02:05.599 --> 02:08.936
Oh I'd say so Garry,
I'd truly say so.

02:11.205 --> 02:12.804
Something is missing.

02:12.806 --> 02:15.173
Well, and what is that Marvin?

02:15.175 --> 02:16.641
What's missing from this day

02:16.643 --> 02:20.044
to make it the
perfect Easter day?

02:20.046 --> 02:23.616
Hmm, I just can't
put a hoof on it Garry,

02:25.151 --> 02:28.653
but something is
definitely amiss.

02:28.655 --> 02:29.988
What is it Marvin?

02:29.990 --> 02:31.325
What is missing?

02:32.192 --> 02:34.361
I don't know what it is.

02:35.862 --> 02:37.364
I just know it is.

02:38.731 --> 02:41.399
I'm totally baa-ffled Marvin.

02:41.401 --> 02:44.168
I'm just totally baa-wildered.

02:44.170 --> 02:47.304
Something is missing to make
it the perfect Easter day,

02:47.306 --> 02:49.541
and neither of us
can tell what it is.

02:49.543 --> 02:51.076
Sunny day.

02:51.078 --> 02:52.376
Check that.

02:52.378 --> 02:53.879
Sweet breeze.

02:53.881 --> 02:55.380
Check that too.

02:55.382 --> 02:59.353
Hmm, now what else makes
a perfect Easter day?

03:00.621 --> 03:01.421
Weehoo!

03:02.823 --> 03:06.792
I'm so excited to start my
egg hunt, but where to start?

03:06.794 --> 03:09.060
I might be an Easter Bunny,
but I don't really know

03:09.062 --> 03:11.262
that much about eggs.

03:11.264 --> 03:14.766
Oh my, I'm afraid
I will need help.

03:14.768 --> 03:15.602
Hmmm...

03:17.770 --> 03:19.304
An Easter egg hunt.

03:19.306 --> 03:21.075
An Easter egg hunt!

03:21.942 --> 03:23.507
Indeed Marvin,

03:23.509 --> 03:27.044
that's what's missing to make
this the perfect Easter day.

03:27.046 --> 03:29.548
An Easter egg hunt!

03:29.550 --> 03:31.348
This day needs?

03:31.350 --> 03:33.552
The Easter Bunny.

03:33.554 --> 03:35.387
He is the only one
who can make this day

03:35.389 --> 03:37.354
the perfect Easter day.

03:37.356 --> 03:40.157
He's the expert of
Easter egg hunts.

03:40.159 --> 03:41.728
The one and only.

03:43.129 --> 03:46.498
The best, maybe even
better than the best.

03:46.500 --> 03:47.768
He is indeed.

03:49.536 --> 03:51.001
Where do you think he is?

03:51.003 --> 03:52.571
When do you think
he'll show up?

03:52.573 --> 03:54.873
It's just not an
Easter day without him.

03:54.875 --> 03:55.975
Not at all.

03:56.810 --> 03:57.644
Indeed.

03:59.179 --> 04:00.013
Weehoo!

04:02.582 --> 04:05.116
Say Marvin, do you
hear what I hear?

04:05.118 --> 04:06.317
The birds?

04:06.319 --> 04:08.085
(BLEATING)

04:08.087 --> 04:09.254
The bees?

04:09.256 --> 04:11.957
(BLEATING)

04:11.959 --> 04:12.793
Weehoo!

04:17.064 --> 04:20.164
Oh but who will help
me on this egg hunt?

04:20.166 --> 04:24.536
I need a friend, a helping
hand, an adventure buddy.

04:24.538 --> 04:26.706
But who, who should I ask?

04:27.807 --> 04:29.541
Oh yes, of course.

04:29.543 --> 04:33.110
Who better to help me find
an egg than a chicken!

04:33.112 --> 04:36.548
I'll go see my friend
Wilma the chicken at once.

04:36.550 --> 04:37.382
It's...

04:37.384 --> 04:38.649
The Easter Bunny.

04:38.651 --> 04:41.452
There he goes over yonder.

04:41.454 --> 04:42.288
Baa-yay.

04:44.124 --> 04:45.192
Moo-lright!

04:46.259 --> 04:47.425
This finally is...

04:47.427 --> 04:49.496
The perfect Easter day.

04:50.531 --> 04:51.365
Weehoo!

04:54.634 --> 04:56.668
This is going to
be the most amazing

04:56.670 --> 04:59.239
Easter egg hunt adventure ever.

05:02.108 --> 05:02.942
Hey Wilma!

05:06.379 --> 05:09.714
(CLUCKS) My great pal
Benny the Easter Bunny,

05:09.716 --> 05:12.183
what brings you
around these parts?

05:12.185 --> 05:15.120
I'm on a mission Wilma,
a very special mission.

05:15.122 --> 05:17.055
(GASPS)
A mission?

05:17.057 --> 05:19.156
What kind of mission is this?

05:19.158 --> 05:21.159
Maybe I can be of help.

05:21.161 --> 05:22.694
You can help alright.

05:22.696 --> 05:25.829
I'm on the biggest
Easter egg hunt ever.

05:25.831 --> 05:27.464
My, dear Benny,

05:27.466 --> 05:30.202
what make this Easter
hunt the biggest ever?

05:30.204 --> 05:34.374
Because, because I'm
looking for a very incredible

05:35.541 --> 05:39.110
Easter egg, the most
incredible of all.

05:39.112 --> 05:43.315
Wow, that sounds like an
awesome Easter egg hunt Benny.

05:43.317 --> 05:47.084
It is, it is, and
I need your help.

05:47.086 --> 05:50.055
My help, but whatever for?

05:50.057 --> 05:52.723
You are the Easter
Bunny, not me.

05:52.725 --> 05:56.527
That may be Wilma,
that very well may be,

05:56.529 --> 05:59.998
but you my friend
are the chicken,

06:00.000 --> 06:02.767
and you know all there
is to know about eggs.

06:02.769 --> 06:03.868
Don't you?

06:03.870 --> 06:06.171
That is true my dear Benny.

06:06.173 --> 06:10.909
I am a bird which makes me an
egg expert alright. (CLUCKS)

06:10.911 --> 06:11.743
I knew it.

06:11.745 --> 06:12.911
You can help me.

06:12.913 --> 06:15.613
Hop onboard and
let's begin the hunt.

06:15.615 --> 06:17.781
Alright, let's go.

06:17.783 --> 06:18.618
Weehoo!

06:21.721 --> 06:24.656
Where do you think we
should start searching?

06:24.658 --> 06:27.959
Hmm, the first question
should not be where

06:27.961 --> 06:31.529
to start searching,
but who laid the egg?

06:31.531 --> 06:32.596
Why?

06:32.598 --> 06:34.265
How's that going to help us?

06:34.267 --> 06:37.534
Easy my dear Benny,
because if we know what bird

06:37.536 --> 06:41.106
laid the egg, we will know
where to start looking.

06:41.108 --> 06:42.707
How is that possible?

06:42.709 --> 06:45.409
Because each bird picks
its own special place

06:45.411 --> 06:46.978
to lay its eggs.

06:46.980 --> 06:49.281
The pigeon likes tall buildings.

06:49.283 --> 06:51.815
The seagull prefers
rocks by the sea,

06:51.817 --> 06:54.586
and the hummingbird
loves the flower bushes.

06:54.588 --> 06:55.588
Ah, I see.

06:57.257 --> 06:59.457
They each pick a
particular spot.

06:59.459 --> 07:00.692
Indeed.

07:00.694 --> 07:04.161
So what bird laid this
egg we're searching for?

07:04.163 --> 07:08.334
Oh it's a magical bird
named the Wish Bird of Easter.

07:09.502 --> 07:12.803
(GASPS) The Wish Bird
of Easter did you say?

07:12.805 --> 07:13.904
Yes.

07:13.906 --> 07:17.007
Ah, she's an amazing bird.

07:17.009 --> 07:20.678
This must've been a very
beautiful and very special egg.

07:20.680 --> 07:22.380
That's right.

07:22.382 --> 07:26.052
It is very special, the
most special of all.

07:28.555 --> 07:31.723
Whoever finds the egg
of the Wish Bird of Easter

07:31.725 --> 07:33.960
will have any wish granted.

07:35.329 --> 07:36.163
Amazing.

07:37.363 --> 07:41.031
We are indeed on a very
special Easter egg hunt.

07:41.033 --> 07:42.966
Now I will tell you where
the Wish Bird of Easter

07:42.968 --> 07:44.269
laid her egg.

07:44.271 --> 07:45.502
You know where?

07:45.504 --> 07:47.105
Of course I do.

07:47.107 --> 07:50.808
She nests on the very
top of Green Mountain.

07:50.810 --> 07:53.010
Wow, to Green Mountain then.

07:53.012 --> 07:53.846
Weehoo!

07:59.185 --> 08:00.918
We're flying right
over Green Mountain

08:00.920 --> 08:02.687
and I don't see the egg.

08:02.689 --> 08:04.456
What do you think Wilma?

08:04.458 --> 08:07.959
Hmm, get a little closer
to the mountaintop Benny.

08:07.961 --> 08:11.029
I have a hunch. (CLUCKS)

08:11.031 --> 08:12.130
Aha!

08:12.132 --> 08:13.498
Just like I suspected.

08:13.500 --> 08:15.033
What is it Wilma?

08:15.035 --> 08:15.966
There.

08:15.968 --> 08:18.002
See that slope right there?

08:18.004 --> 08:20.271
The egg must've rolled
down the mountain

08:20.273 --> 08:22.139
into the valley below.

08:22.141 --> 08:24.709
C'mon Benny, let's
fly down the mountain

08:24.711 --> 08:27.144
and see where that egg landed.

08:27.146 --> 08:28.048
Let's go.

08:29.815 --> 08:31.382
Look down there Benny.

08:31.384 --> 08:34.818
That seems like the perfect
spot for an egg to get snagged.

08:34.821 --> 08:36.421
Let's check it out.

08:36.423 --> 08:38.623
Do you see anything?

08:38.625 --> 08:42.025
Not yet, but wait
just a minute Benny.

08:42.028 --> 08:43.193
What is it?

08:43.196 --> 08:44.863
Do you know where we are?

08:44.865 --> 08:46.164
No, where?

08:46.166 --> 08:49.300
This is Fairy Tale Valley.

08:49.302 --> 08:51.469
I've heard of this place.

08:51.471 --> 08:54.638
All its inhabitants
love to tell stories.

08:54.640 --> 08:57.574
It's the perfect place
for our Easter egg hunt.

08:57.576 --> 08:58.943
It is.

08:58.945 --> 09:00.811
There couldn't be a more
magical place to find

09:00.813 --> 09:04.616
a special Easter egg
than Fairy Tale Valley.

09:04.618 --> 09:05.883
Look over there.

09:05.885 --> 09:08.185
There goes one of the
little storytellers.

09:08.187 --> 09:09.921
Ooh, it's Milly mouse.

09:09.923 --> 09:12.589
Let's go listen to one
of her stories Wilma.

09:12.591 --> 09:13.525
Can we?

09:13.527 --> 09:15.826
(CLUCKS)
Sure we can.

09:15.828 --> 09:17.228
Let's go.

09:17.230 --> 09:20.500
(LIVELY COUNTRY MUSIC)

09:22.635 --> 09:23.734
Hello Milly.

09:23.736 --> 09:25.302
My name is Benny
the Easter Bunny

09:25.304 --> 09:27.805
and this is my friend
Wilma the chicken,

09:27.807 --> 09:31.608
and we're on a very
special Easter egg hunt.

09:31.610 --> 09:34.612
We heard you tell
amazing stories.

09:34.614 --> 09:36.848
Will you tell us a story?

09:36.850 --> 09:39.850
A rat was traveling
along the King's highway.

09:39.852 --> 09:43.153
He was a very proud rat,
considering his small size

09:43.155 --> 09:46.023
and the bad reputation
all rats have.

09:46.025 --> 09:50.195
As Mr. Rat walked along, he
kept mostly to the ditch.

09:50.197 --> 09:52.464
He noticed a great
commotion up the road,

09:52.466 --> 09:56.066
and soon a grand
procession came in view.

09:56.068 --> 09:58.268
It was the King and his retinue.

09:58.270 --> 10:00.738
The King rode on a huge elephant

10:00.740 --> 10:03.874
adorned with the most
gorgeous trappings.

10:03.876 --> 10:06.710
With the King in
his luxurious howdah

10:06.712 --> 10:09.613
were the royal dog and cat.

10:09.615 --> 10:12.483
A great crowd of people
followed the procession.

10:12.485 --> 10:15.619
They were so taken up with
admiration of the elephant,

10:15.621 --> 10:17.589
that the rat was not noticed.

10:17.591 --> 10:19.590
His pride was hurt.

10:19.592 --> 10:22.326
"What fools!" he cried.

10:22.328 --> 10:25.897
"Look at me, and you will soon
forget that clumsy elephant.

10:25.899 --> 10:29.032
"Is it his great size that
makes your eyes pop out?

10:29.034 --> 10:31.301
"Or is it his wrinkled hide?

10:31.303 --> 10:35.006
"Why, I have eyes and ears
and as many legs as he.

10:35.008 --> 10:38.743
"I am of just as much
importance, and."

10:38.745 --> 10:42.914
But just then the royal cat
spied him, and the next instant,

10:42.916 --> 10:47.087
the rat knew he was not quite
so important as an elephant.

10:48.321 --> 10:51.155
A resemblance to the
great in some things

10:51.157 --> 10:53.223
does not make us great.

10:53.225 --> 10:55.227
Wow, that was amazing.

10:56.129 --> 10:58.028
Another one please Milly.

10:58.030 --> 11:00.565
Some boys were playing one
day at the edge of a pond

11:00.567 --> 11:03.434
in which lived a
family of frogs.

11:03.436 --> 11:06.804
The boys amused themselves by
throwing stones into the pond

11:06.806 --> 11:10.208
so as to make them skip
on top of the water.

11:10.210 --> 11:13.611
The stones were flying thick
and fast and the boys were

11:13.613 --> 11:16.347
enjoying themselves very
much, but the poor frogs

11:16.349 --> 11:19.617
in the pond were
trembling with fear.

11:19.619 --> 11:22.587
At last one of the frogs,
the oldest and bravest,

11:22.589 --> 11:25.656
put his head out of
the water, and said,

11:25.658 --> 11:28.626
"Oh, please, dear children,
stop your cruel play.

11:28.628 --> 11:33.031
"Though it may be fun for
you, it means death to us."

11:33.033 --> 11:35.465
Always stop to think
whether your fun

11:35.467 --> 11:39.002
may not be the cause of
another's unhappiness.

11:39.004 --> 11:41.138
Oh tell us another story.

11:41.140 --> 11:44.175
In a spell of dry weather,
when the birds could find very

11:44.177 --> 11:47.111
little to drink, a thirsty
crow found a pitcher with

11:47.113 --> 11:50.348
a little water in it, but
the pitcher was high and had

11:50.350 --> 11:52.849
a narrow neck, and no
matter how he tried,

11:52.851 --> 11:55.252
the crow could not
reach the water.

11:55.254 --> 11:57.888
The poor thing felt as
if he must die of thirst.

11:57.890 --> 12:00.358
Then an idea came to him.

12:00.360 --> 12:02.660
Picking up some small pebbles,

12:02.662 --> 12:05.563
he dropped them into
the pitcher one by one.

12:05.565 --> 12:09.467
With each pebble the water
rose a little higher until

12:09.469 --> 12:12.502
at last it was near
enough so he could drink.

12:12.504 --> 12:16.239
In a pinch a good use of
our wits may help us out.

12:16.241 --> 12:17.709
Tell us another.

12:17.711 --> 12:20.811
One bright day in late
autumn a family of ants were

12:20.813 --> 12:23.781
bustling about in the warm
sunshine, drying out the grain

12:23.783 --> 12:26.383
they had stored up during
the summer, when a starving

12:26.385 --> 12:29.420
grasshopper, his
fiddle under his arm,

12:29.422 --> 12:32.456
came up and humbly
begged for a bite to eat.

12:32.458 --> 12:34.858
"What?" cried the
ants in surprise,

12:34.860 --> 12:37.395
"haven't you stored anything
away for the winter?

12:37.397 --> 12:40.330
"What in the world were
you doing all last summer?"

12:40.332 --> 12:43.001
"I didn't have time
to store up any food,"

12:43.003 --> 12:44.334
whined the grasshopper.

12:44.336 --> 12:45.837
"I was so busy making music that

12:45.839 --> 12:48.539
"before I knew it
the summer was gone."

12:48.541 --> 12:51.041
The ants shrugged their
shoulders in disgust.

12:51.043 --> 12:53.777
"Making music, were
you?" they cried.

12:53.779 --> 12:55.813
"Very well, now dance."

12:55.815 --> 12:57.482
And they turned their
backs on the grasshopper

12:57.484 --> 12:59.416
and went on with their work.

12:59.418 --> 13:02.853
There's a time for work
and a time for play.

13:02.855 --> 13:04.622
Wow, what great stories.

13:04.624 --> 13:06.190
You were right Wilma.

13:06.192 --> 13:09.459
This place is the best place
for an Easter egg hunt ever.

13:09.461 --> 13:10.927
Where to next?

13:10.929 --> 13:12.162
There!

13:12.164 --> 13:13.864
Looks like the egg
rolled that way.

13:13.866 --> 13:15.465
Let's go.

13:15.467 --> 13:16.968
See anything?

13:16.970 --> 13:19.903
Hmm, the egg was definitely
here at some point,

13:19.905 --> 13:23.241
but looks like it kept
rolling down a slope.

13:23.243 --> 13:25.578
Looks like it went that way.

13:26.712 --> 13:28.646
Look over there.

13:28.648 --> 13:29.546
What, the egg?

13:29.548 --> 13:31.148
No a horse.

13:31.150 --> 13:35.320
Oh that's Horse, the best
equine storyteller in the world.

13:36.623 --> 13:39.357
Wow, will he tell us a story?

13:39.359 --> 13:41.059
I'm sure he will.

13:41.061 --> 13:43.094
Let's go see him.

13:43.096 --> 13:45.865
(CHEERFUL MUSIC)

13:50.503 --> 13:51.969
Hello Horse.

13:51.971 --> 13:54.939
My name is Benny the Easter
Bunny and this is Wilma.

13:54.941 --> 13:57.407
Will you tell us a story?

13:57.409 --> 14:00.877
There was once a little
kid whose growing horns

14:00.879 --> 14:03.781
made him think he was
a grown-up billy goat

14:03.783 --> 14:06.217
and able to take
care of himself.

14:06.219 --> 14:10.188
So one evening when the flock
started home from the pasture

14:10.190 --> 14:14.191
and his mother called, the kid
paid no heed and kept right

14:14.193 --> 14:16.761
on nibbling the tender grass.

14:16.763 --> 14:21.733
A little later when he lifted
his head, the flock was gone.

14:21.735 --> 14:23.868
He was all alone.

14:23.870 --> 14:25.670
The sun was sinking.

14:25.672 --> 14:28.638
Long shadows came
creeping over the ground.

14:28.640 --> 14:31.441
A chilly little wind
came creeping with them

14:31.443 --> 14:34.145
making scary noises
in the grass.

14:34.147 --> 14:37.681
The kid shivered as he
thought of the terrible wolf.

14:37.683 --> 14:40.685
Then he started
wildly over the field,

14:40.687 --> 14:43.087
bleating for his mother.

14:43.089 --> 14:47.260
But not halfway, near a clump
of trees, there was the wolf.

14:48.794 --> 14:52.629
The kid knew there was
little hope for him.

14:52.631 --> 14:55.867
"Please, Mr. Wolf,"
he said trembling,

14:55.869 --> 14:58.502
"I know you are going to eat me.

14:58.504 --> 15:01.839
"But first please
pipe me a tune,

15:01.841 --> 15:06.511
"for I want to dance and
be merry as long as I can."

15:06.513 --> 15:10.614
The wolf liked the idea of a
little music before eating,

15:10.616 --> 15:13.084
so he struck up a merry tune

15:13.086 --> 15:16.621
and the kid leaped
and frisked gaily.

15:16.623 --> 15:20.791
Meanwhile, the flock was
moving slowly homeward.

15:20.793 --> 15:25.162
In the still evening air the
wolf's piping carried far.

15:25.164 --> 15:27.665
The shepherd dogs
pricked up their ears.

15:27.667 --> 15:31.536
They recognized the song the
wolf sings before a feast,

15:31.538 --> 15:35.105
and in a moment they were
racing back to the pasture.

15:35.107 --> 15:39.509
The wolf's song ended
suddenly, and as he ran,

15:39.511 --> 15:43.748
with the dogs at his heels,
he called himself a fool

15:43.750 --> 15:46.416
for turning piper
to please a kid,

15:46.418 --> 15:50.490
when he should have stuck
to his butcher's trade.

15:51.825 --> 15:55.425
Do not let anything turn
you from your purpose.

15:55.427 --> 15:59.463
Before we go, please
tell us another story?

15:59.465 --> 16:02.934
The tortoise, you know,
carries his house on his back.

16:02.936 --> 16:07.338
No matter how hard he
tries, he cannot leave home.

16:07.340 --> 16:11.474
They say that Jupiter punished
him so, because he was such

16:11.476 --> 16:14.244
a lazy stay-at-home that he
would not go to Jupiter's

16:14.246 --> 16:17.013
wedding, even when
especially invited.

16:17.015 --> 16:20.651
After many years, tortoise
began to wish he had gone

16:20.653 --> 16:22.386
to that wedding.

16:22.388 --> 16:25.289
When he saw how gaily
the birds flew about

16:25.291 --> 16:28.526
and how the hare and the chipmunk
and all the other animals

16:28.528 --> 16:32.095
ran nimbly by, always eager
to see everything there was

16:32.097 --> 16:36.533
to be seen, the tortoise felt
very sad and discontented.

16:36.535 --> 16:40.137
He wanted to see the world
too, and there he was with

16:40.139 --> 16:43.107
a house on his back
and little short legs

16:43.109 --> 16:45.609
that would hardly
drag him along.

16:45.611 --> 16:47.945
One day he met a pair of ducks

16:47.947 --> 16:50.580
and told them all his trouble.

16:50.582 --> 16:53.984
"We can help you see the
world," said the ducks.

16:53.986 --> 16:56.753
"Take hold of this
stick with your teeth

16:56.755 --> 17:00.023
"and we will carry you far up
in the air where you can see

17:00.025 --> 17:01.959
"the whole countryside.

17:01.961 --> 17:05.563
"But keep quiet or
you will be sorry."

17:05.565 --> 17:08.699
The tortoise was
very glad indeed.

17:08.701 --> 17:11.434
He seized the stick
firmly with his teeth,

17:11.435 --> 17:14.905
the two ducks took hold
of it one at each end,

17:14.906 --> 17:18.342
and away they sailed
up toward the clouds.

17:18.344 --> 17:20.413
Just then a crow flew by.

17:21.847 --> 17:25.583
He was very much astonished at
the strange sight and cried;

17:25.585 --> 17:29.286
"This must be surely
the King of Tortoises!"

17:29.288 --> 17:32.523
"Why certainly,"
began the tortoise.

17:32.525 --> 17:36.559
But as he opened his mouth
to say these foolish words

17:36.561 --> 17:39.229
he lost his hold on the stick,

17:39.231 --> 17:42.099
and down he fell to the ground.

17:42.101 --> 17:47.037
Foolish curiosity and vanity
often lead to misfortune.

17:47.039 --> 17:48.572
Again Horse.

17:48.574 --> 17:52.642
"Why in the world do you
walk sideways like that?"

17:52.644 --> 17:54.812
said a mother crab to her son.

17:54.814 --> 17:56.713
"You should always
walk straight forward

17:56.715 --> 17:58.481
"with your toes turned out."

17:58.483 --> 18:00.785
"Show me how to
walk, mother dear,"

18:00.787 --> 18:03.086
answered the little
crab obediently.

18:03.088 --> 18:04.988
"I want to learn."

18:04.990 --> 18:09.162
So the old crab tried and
tried to walk straight forward,

18:10.496 --> 18:14.465
but she could walk sideways
only, like her son.

18:14.467 --> 18:17.101
And when she wanted
to turn her toes out

18:17.103 --> 18:19.872
she tripped and
fell on her nose.

18:20.839 --> 18:22.739
Do not tell others how to act

18:22.741 --> 18:25.709
unless you can set
a good example.

18:25.711 --> 18:28.045
Another story Horse.

18:28.047 --> 18:31.349
An ox came down to
a reedy pool to drink.

18:31.351 --> 18:33.851
As he splashed heavily
into the water,

18:33.853 --> 18:36.653
he crushed a young
frog into the mud.

18:36.655 --> 18:39.489
The old frog soon missed
the little one and asked

18:39.491 --> 18:42.226
his brothers and sisters
what had become of him.

18:42.228 --> 18:46.162
"A great big monster,"
said one of them,

18:46.164 --> 18:49.900
"stepped on little brother
with one of his huge feet!"

18:49.902 --> 18:54.073
"Big, was he?" said the old
frog, puffing herself up.

18:55.008 --> 18:57.440
"Was he as big as this?"

18:57.442 --> 19:00.643
"Oh, much bigger!" they cried.

19:00.645 --> 19:03.381
The frog puffed up still more.

19:03.383 --> 19:07.084
"He could not have been
bigger than this," she said.

19:07.086 --> 19:10.488
But the little frogs all declared
that the monster was much,

19:10.490 --> 19:14.324
much bigger and the old
frog kept puffing herself

19:14.326 --> 19:18.330
out more and more until,
all at once, she burst.

19:21.134 --> 19:23.635
Do not attempt the impossible.

19:24.804 --> 19:26.836
That was so much fun.

19:26.838 --> 19:30.040
I'm so glad the egg rolled
down into Fairy Tale Valley.

19:30.042 --> 19:32.843
There couldn't be a more
amazing place to hunt

19:32.845 --> 19:34.978
for a special Easter egg.

19:34.980 --> 19:35.912
Hey!

19:35.914 --> 19:37.581
I think the egg went that-away.

19:37.583 --> 19:38.915
I think so too.

19:38.917 --> 19:39.751
Let's go.

19:42.587 --> 19:44.087
Look, over there.

19:44.089 --> 19:45.021
What is it?

19:45.023 --> 19:46.891
It's Vincenzo the bull.

19:46.893 --> 19:49.828
BENNY: Does he
tell stories too?

19:50.762 --> 19:52.662
(LAUGHS)
Yes, of course.

19:52.664 --> 19:54.798
He wouldn't be an inhabitant
of Fairy Tale Valley

19:54.800 --> 19:56.199
if he didn't.

19:56.201 --> 19:58.602
Two travelers were
walking along the seashore.

19:58.604 --> 20:01.238
Far out they saw something
riding on the waves.

20:01.240 --> 20:05.109
"Look," said one, "a great ship
rides in from distant lands,

20:05.111 --> 20:06.744
"bearing rich treasures."

20:06.746 --> 20:09.580
The object they saw came
ever nearer the shore.

20:09.582 --> 20:12.382
"No," said the other, "that
is not a treasure ship.

20:12.384 --> 20:14.351
"That is some fisherman's skiff,

20:14.353 --> 20:16.620
"with the day's catch
of savory fish."

20:16.622 --> 20:18.689
Still nearer came the object.

20:18.691 --> 20:20.724
The waves washed it up on shore.

20:20.726 --> 20:24.161
"It is a chest of gold lost
from some wreck," they cried.

20:24.163 --> 20:26.430
Both travelers
rushed to the beach,

20:26.432 --> 20:30.366
but they found nothing
but a water-soaked log.

20:30.368 --> 20:33.871
Do not let your hopes carry
you away from reality.

20:33.873 --> 20:35.538
Another one Vincenzo.

20:35.540 --> 20:38.275
A wolf had stolen a lamb
and was carrying it off to his

20:38.277 --> 20:41.444
lair to eat it, but his plans
were very much changed when

20:41.446 --> 20:44.547
he met a lion, who,
without making any excuses,

20:44.549 --> 20:46.650
took the lamb away from him.

20:46.652 --> 20:49.085
The wolf made off
to a safe distance,

20:49.087 --> 20:51.354
and then said in a
much injured tone,

20:51.356 --> 20:54.057
"You have no right to take
my property like that."

20:54.059 --> 20:57.228
The lion looked back, but as
the wolf was too far away to

20:57.230 --> 21:00.197
be taught a lesson without too
much inconvenience, he said,

21:00.199 --> 21:01.664
"Your property?

21:01.666 --> 21:04.634
"Did you buy it, or did the
shepherd make you a gift of it?

21:04.636 --> 21:07.770
"Pray tell me, how
did you get it?"

21:07.772 --> 21:10.540
What is evil won is evil lost.

21:10.542 --> 21:13.344
My favorite one so far.

21:13.346 --> 21:16.180
A stag, drinking from a
crystal spring saw himself

21:16.182 --> 21:18.248
mirrored in the clear water.

21:18.250 --> 21:20.584
He greatly admired the
graceful arch of his antlers,

21:20.586 --> 21:23.786
but he was very much ashamed
of his spindling legs.

21:23.788 --> 21:26.891
"How can it be," he sighed,
"that I should be cursed with

21:26.893 --> 21:30.193
"such legs when I have
so magnificent a crown?"

21:30.195 --> 21:33.596
At that moment he scented
a panther and in an instant

21:33.598 --> 21:35.732
was bounding away
through the forest.

21:35.734 --> 21:38.401
But as he ran his wide-spreading
antlers caught in the

21:38.403 --> 21:41.572
branches of the trees, and
soon the Panther overtook him.

21:41.574 --> 21:44.475
Then the Stag perceived that
the legs of which he was

21:44.477 --> 21:47.010
so ashamed would have
saved him had it not been

21:47.012 --> 21:49.345
for the useless
ornaments on his head.

21:49.347 --> 21:53.484
We often make much of the
ornamental and despise the useful.

21:53.486 --> 21:56.088
I love the Fairy Tale Valley.

21:57.522 --> 22:00.623
The peacock, they say, did
not at first have the beautiful

22:00.625 --> 22:03.526
feathers in which he
now takes so much pride.

22:03.528 --> 22:07.198
These, Juno, whose favorite
he was, granted to him one day

22:07.200 --> 22:10.100
when he begged her for a train
of feathers to distinguish

22:10.102 --> 22:12.068
him from the other birds.

22:12.070 --> 22:15.838
Then, decked in his finery,
gleaming with emerald, gold,

22:15.840 --> 22:19.209
purple, and azure, he strutted
proudly among the birds.

22:19.211 --> 22:21.711
All regarded him with envy.

22:21.713 --> 22:23.546
Even the most beautiful
pheasant could

22:23.548 --> 22:25.382
see that his beauty
was surpassed.

22:25.384 --> 22:28.651
Presently the peacock
saw an eagle soaring high

22:28.653 --> 22:31.488
up in the blue sky and
felt a desire to fly,

22:31.490 --> 22:33.524
as he had been accustomed to do.

22:33.526 --> 22:35.926
Lifting his wings he tried
to rise from the ground,

22:35.928 --> 22:38.796
but the weight of his
magnificent train held him down.

22:38.798 --> 22:41.998
Instead of flying up to greet
the first rays of the morning

22:42.000 --> 22:45.302
sun or to bathe in the rosy
light among the floating clouds

22:45.304 --> 22:48.671
at sunset, he would have to
walk the ground more encumbered

22:48.673 --> 22:52.676
and oppressed than any
common barnyard fowl.

22:52.678 --> 22:56.646
Do not sacrifice your freedom
for the sake of pomp and show.

22:56.648 --> 22:57.482
Weehoo!

22:59.919 --> 23:01.151
So much fun!

23:01.153 --> 23:04.020
I almost forgot we were
on an Easter egg hunt.

23:04.022 --> 23:05.922
Which way now Wilma?

23:05.924 --> 23:10.227
Well I don't see any clue
where the egg might've landed.

23:10.229 --> 23:12.131
So what do we do now?

23:13.665 --> 23:15.599
I have to go with
my chicken senses.

23:15.601 --> 23:17.601
(SQUAWKS)

23:17.603 --> 23:19.705
I'd say it went that way.

23:21.673 --> 23:23.841
You're the best Wilma.

23:23.843 --> 23:24.677
Let's go.

23:27.346 --> 23:29.246
Is that a donkey down there?

23:29.248 --> 23:30.349
It's Daisy!

23:31.217 --> 23:33.616
Daisy the donkey, oh my!

23:33.618 --> 23:35.018
Let's go hear a story.

23:35.020 --> 23:36.219
Let's go.

23:36.221 --> 23:38.021
I wouldn't miss
this for the world.

23:38.023 --> 23:39.555
Hello Daisy.

23:39.557 --> 23:42.191
My name is Benny and this is
my friend Wilma the chicken.

23:42.193 --> 23:44.928
We're on an Easter egg
hunt, but we were wondering

23:44.930 --> 23:48.766
if you could tell us a
story before we move on.

23:48.768 --> 23:52.001
An old lion, whose teeth
and claws were so worn that it

23:52.003 --> 23:54.904
was not so easy for him to get
food as in his younger days,

23:54.906 --> 23:57.106
pretended that he was sick.

23:57.108 --> 24:00.009
He took care to let all his
neighbors know about it,

24:00.011 --> 24:03.146
and then lay down in his
cave to wait for visitors.

24:03.148 --> 24:05.516
And when they came to
offer him their sympathy,

24:05.518 --> 24:08.352
he ate them up one by one.

24:08.354 --> 24:12.789
The fox came too, but he
was very cautious about it.

24:12.791 --> 24:15.124
Standing at a safe
distance from the cave,

24:15.126 --> 24:17.960
he inquired politely
after the lion's health.

24:17.962 --> 24:21.065
The lion replied that
he was very ill indeed,

24:21.067 --> 24:23.933
and asked the fox to
step in for a moment.

24:23.935 --> 24:27.203
But Master Fox very
wisely stayed outside,

24:27.205 --> 24:31.872
thanking the lion very
kindly for the invitation.

24:31.874 --> 24:33.576
"I should be glad to do
as you ask," he added,

24:33.578 --> 24:36.013
"but I have noticed that
there are many footprints

24:36.015 --> 24:38.716
"leading into your cave
and none coming out.

24:38.718 --> 24:41.184
"Pray tell me, how do
your visitors find their

24:41.186 --> 24:42.686
"way out again?"

24:42.688 --> 24:45.456
Take warning from the
misfortunes of others.

24:45.458 --> 24:48.057
I think we have
time for one more.

24:48.059 --> 24:50.294
What do you say Daisy?

24:50.296 --> 24:52.962
A lion and a man chanced
to travel in company

24:52.964 --> 24:54.430
through the forest.

24:54.432 --> 24:56.232
They soon began to quarrel,
for each of them boasted

24:56.234 --> 24:59.803
that he and his kind were
far superior to the other

24:59.805 --> 25:02.439
both in strength and mind.

25:02.441 --> 25:04.708
Now they reached a
clearing in the forest

25:04.710 --> 25:06.744
and there stood a statue.

25:06.746 --> 25:09.145
It was a representation
of Hercules

25:09.147 --> 25:12.216
in the act of tearing the
jaws of the Nemean lion.

25:12.218 --> 25:15.084
"See," said the man,
"that's how strong we are.

25:15.086 --> 25:18.122
"The King of Beasts is
like wax in our hands."

25:18.124 --> 25:21.525
"Ho!" laughed the lion,
"a man made that statue.

25:21.527 --> 25:23.727
"It would have been
quite a different scene

25:23.729 --> 25:26.095
"had a lion made it."

25:26.097 --> 25:27.930
It all depends on
the point of view,

25:27.932 --> 25:29.932
and who tells the story.

25:29.934 --> 25:31.602
BENNY: Awesome!

25:31.604 --> 25:33.536
DAISY: There was
once an ass whose master

25:33.538 --> 25:35.538
also owned a lap dog.

25:35.540 --> 25:38.709
This dog was a favorite and
received many a pat and kind

25:38.711 --> 25:42.278
word from his master, as well
as choice bits from his plate.

25:42.280 --> 25:45.382
Every day the dog would run
to meet the master, frisking

25:45.384 --> 25:49.152
playfully about and leaping
up to lick his hands and face.

25:49.154 --> 25:51.955
All this the ass saw
with much discontent.

25:51.957 --> 25:55.057
Though he was well fed,
he had much work to do;

25:55.059 --> 25:58.661
besides, the master hardly
ever took any notice of him.

25:58.663 --> 26:02.199
Now the jealous ass got it
into his silly head that all he

26:02.201 --> 26:06.068
had to do to win his master's
favor was to act like the dog.

26:06.070 --> 26:08.271
So one day he left his stable

26:08.273 --> 26:11.872
and clattered eagerly
into the house.

26:11.874 --> 26:13.410
Finding his master seated
at the dinner table,

26:13.412 --> 26:16.546
he kicked up his heels and,
with a loud bray, pranced

26:16.548 --> 26:20.484
giddily around the table,
upsetting it as he did so.

26:20.486 --> 26:23.219
Then he planted his forefeet
on his master's knees

26:23.221 --> 26:25.788
and rolled out his tongue
to lick the master's face,

26:25.790 --> 26:28.191
as he had seen the dog do.

26:28.193 --> 26:31.929
But his weight upset the
chair, and ass and man rolled

26:31.931 --> 26:35.532
over together in the pile of
broken dishes from the table.

26:35.534 --> 26:38.201
The master was much alarmed
at the strange behavior

26:38.203 --> 26:41.138
of the ass, and calling
for help, soon attracted

26:41.140 --> 26:43.273
the attention of the servants.

26:43.275 --> 26:45.776
When they saw the danger the
master was in from the clumsy

26:45.778 --> 26:48.946
beast, they set upon the
ass and drove him with kicks

26:48.948 --> 26:51.113
and blows back to the stable.

26:51.115 --> 26:53.217
There they left him to
mourn the foolishness

26:53.219 --> 26:56.253
that had brought him
nothing but a sound beating.

26:56.255 --> 26:59.389
Behavior that is regarded
as agreeable in one

26:59.391 --> 27:02.661
is very rude and
impertinent in another.

27:04.063 --> 27:07.230
Do not try to gain favor by
acting in a way that is contrary

27:07.232 --> 27:09.699
to your own nature
and character.

27:09.701 --> 27:11.602
You're the best Daisy.

27:11.604 --> 27:13.569
One more please.

27:13.571 --> 27:15.873
DAISY: A milkmaid had
been out to milk the cows

27:15.875 --> 27:18.475
and was returning from the
field with the shining milk pail

27:18.477 --> 27:21.010
balanced nicely on her head.

27:21.012 --> 27:23.247
As she walked along,
her pretty head was busy

27:23.249 --> 27:25.414
with plans for the days to come.

27:25.416 --> 27:28.218
"This good, rich
milk," she mused,

27:28.220 --> 27:30.754
"will give me plenty
of cream to churn.

27:30.756 --> 27:32.855
"The butter I make I
will take to market,

27:32.857 --> 27:34.591
"and with the money I get for it

27:34.593 --> 27:36.793
"I will buy a lot of
eggs for hatching.

27:36.795 --> 27:38.929
"How nice it will be
when they are all hatched

27:38.931 --> 27:41.131
"and the yard is full
of fine young chicks.

27:41.133 --> 27:44.267
"Then when May Day comes I
will sell them, and with the

27:44.269 --> 27:47.770
"money I'll buy a lovely new
dress to wear to the fair.

27:47.772 --> 27:49.672
"All the young men
will look at me,

27:49.674 --> 27:52.976
"but I shall very quickly send
them about their business."

27:52.978 --> 27:55.077
As she thought of how she
would settle that matter,

27:55.079 --> 27:58.282
she tossed her head scornfully,
and down fell the pail

27:58.284 --> 27:59.815
of milk to the ground.

27:59.817 --> 28:03.687
And all the milk flowed out,
and with it vanished butter and

28:03.689 --> 28:07.860
eggs and chicks and new dress
and all the milkmaid's pride.

28:09.327 --> 28:12.496
Do not count your chickens
before they are hatched.

28:12.498 --> 28:13.332
Weehoo!

28:16.402 --> 28:19.236
Look down there, something
twinkling in the grass.

28:19.238 --> 28:21.203
It could be the egg.

28:21.205 --> 28:22.805
Look Wilma.

28:22.807 --> 28:25.776
We're flying right
over Donna's pond.

28:25.778 --> 28:29.114
Let's go say hi and
listen to a story.

28:36.355 --> 28:37.921
Hello there Donna.

28:37.923 --> 28:41.224
We're on an egg hunt, but
we were wondering if...

28:41.226 --> 28:43.125
If you'd tell us a story.

28:43.127 --> 28:44.961
A lion lay asleep
in the forest,

28:44.963 --> 28:48.332
his great head
resting on his paws.

28:48.334 --> 28:51.735
A timid little mouse came
upon him unexpectedly,

28:51.737 --> 28:54.805
and in her fright and
haste to get away,

28:54.807 --> 28:57.440
ran across the lion's nose.

28:57.442 --> 29:01.545
Roused from his nap, the lion
laid his huge paw angrily

29:01.547 --> 29:04.347
on the tiny creature
to kill her.

29:04.349 --> 29:07.851
"Spare me!" begged
the poor mouse.

29:07.853 --> 29:12.024
"Please let me go and some
day I will surely repay you."

29:13.459 --> 29:17.193
The lion was much amused to
think that a mouse could ever

29:17.195 --> 29:21.465
help him, but he was generous
and finally let the mouse go.

29:21.467 --> 29:25.568
Some days later, while stalking
his prey in the forest,

29:25.570 --> 29:30.140
the lion was caught in the
toils of a hunter's net.

29:30.142 --> 29:33.943
Unable to free himself,
he filled the forest with

29:33.945 --> 29:35.446
his angry roaring.

29:36.882 --> 29:39.583
The mouse knew the voice
and quickly found the lion

29:39.585 --> 29:41.250
struggling in the net.

29:41.252 --> 29:43.719
Running to one of the
great ropes that bound him,

29:43.721 --> 29:47.893
she gnawed it until it parted,
and soon the lion was free.

29:49.294 --> 29:52.595
"You laughed when I said I would
repay you," said the mouse.

29:52.597 --> 29:56.400
"Now you see that even a
mouse can help a lion."

29:56.402 --> 29:59.068
A kindness is never wasted.

29:59.070 --> 30:01.438
One more, please Donna.

30:01.440 --> 30:04.607
A shepherd boy tended
his master's sheep

30:04.609 --> 30:08.478
near a dark forest not
far from the village.

30:08.480 --> 30:12.282
Soon he found life in
the pasture very dull.

30:12.284 --> 30:16.486
All he could do to amuse
himself was to talk

30:16.488 --> 30:20.190
to his dog or play on
his shepherd's pipe.

30:20.192 --> 30:24.326
One day as he sat watching the
sheep and the quiet forest,

30:24.328 --> 30:27.564
and thinking what he would
do should he see a wolf,

30:27.566 --> 30:30.600
he thought of a plan
to amuse himself.

30:30.602 --> 30:33.870
His master had told him to
call for help should a wolf

30:33.872 --> 30:37.774
attack the flock, and the
villagers would drive it away.

30:37.776 --> 30:41.010
So now, though he had not
seen anything that even looked

30:41.012 --> 30:44.480
like a wolf, he ran toward
the village shouting

30:44.482 --> 30:47.653
at the top of his
voice, "Wolf! Wolf!"

30:49.087 --> 30:51.688
As he expected, the villagers
who heard the cry dropped

30:51.690 --> 30:55.158
their work and ran in great
excitement to the pasture,

30:55.160 --> 30:58.260
but when they got there
they found the boy doubled

30:58.262 --> 31:02.431
up with laughter at the
trick he had played on them.

31:02.433 --> 31:06.436
A few days later the
shepherd boy again shouted,

31:06.438 --> 31:07.539
"Wolf! Wolf!"

31:09.173 --> 31:11.807
Again the villagers
ran to help him,

31:11.809 --> 31:14.577
only to be laughed at again.

31:14.579 --> 31:19.382
Then one evening as the sun
was setting behind the forest

31:19.384 --> 31:22.285
and the shadows were creeping
out over the pasture,

31:22.287 --> 31:25.689
a wolf really did spring
from the underbrush

31:25.691 --> 31:27.790
and fall upon the sheep.

31:27.792 --> 31:30.026
In terror the boy ran
toward the village

31:30.028 --> 31:31.864
shouting "Wolf! Wolf!"

31:33.298 --> 31:36.099
But though the
villagers heard the cry,

31:36.101 --> 31:39.536
they did not run to help
him as they had before.

31:39.538 --> 31:41.805
"He cannot fool us again.

31:41.807 --> 31:45.208
"He cannot fool us
again," they said.

31:45.210 --> 31:47.978
The wolf killed a great
many of the boy's sheep

31:47.980 --> 31:51.547
and then slipped
away into the forest.

31:51.549 --> 31:55.619
Liars are not believed even
when they speak the truth.

31:55.621 --> 31:58.488
That was a great story.

31:58.490 --> 32:00.457
Please tell us another.

32:00.459 --> 32:02.959
A gnat flew over the
meadow with much buzzing

32:02.961 --> 32:05.828
for so small a creature
and settled on the tip

32:05.830 --> 32:08.597
of one of the horns of a bull.

32:08.599 --> 32:12.701
After he had rested a short
time, he made ready to fly away,

32:12.703 --> 32:16.238
but before he left he
begged the bull's pardon

32:16.240 --> 32:20.177
for having used his horn
for a resting place.

32:20.179 --> 32:24.314
"You must be very glad to
have me go now," he said.

32:24.316 --> 32:28.218
"It's all the same to
me," replied the bull.

32:28.220 --> 32:31.188
"I did not even know
you were there."

32:31.190 --> 32:34.324
We are often of greater
importance in our own eyes

32:34.326 --> 32:37.160
than in the eyes
of our neighbor.

32:37.162 --> 32:41.030
The smaller the mind,
the greater the conceit.

32:41.032 --> 32:43.967
We can surely
stay for one more.

32:43.969 --> 32:47.003
DONNA: Two travelers,
walking in the noonday sun,

32:47.005 --> 32:51.507
sought the shade of a
wide-spreading tree to rest.

32:51.509 --> 32:54.510
As they lay looking up
among the pleasant leaves,

32:54.512 --> 32:58.081
they saw that it
was a Plane Tree.

32:58.083 --> 33:01.084
"How useless is the
Plane!" said one of them.

33:01.086 --> 33:03.018
"It bears no fruit whatever,

33:03.020 --> 33:06.189
"and only serves to litter
the ground with leaves."

33:06.191 --> 33:10.559
"Ungrateful creatures." said
a voice from the Plane Tree.

33:10.561 --> 33:12.528
"You lie here in
my cooling shade,

33:12.530 --> 33:14.597
"and yet you say I am useless.

33:14.599 --> 33:17.066
"Thus ungratefully, oh Jupiter,

33:17.068 --> 33:19.870
"do men receive
their blessings."

33:19.872 --> 33:24.076
Our best blessings are
often the least appreciated.

33:27.346 --> 33:28.911
I think we're
getting close Wilma.

33:28.913 --> 33:30.212
What do you think?

33:30.214 --> 33:32.148
I think so too, but wait,

33:32.150 --> 33:35.684
I think I see egg
tracks over there.

33:35.686 --> 33:36.819
(GASPS)

33:36.821 --> 33:39.055
The Easter egg
rolled down that way.

33:39.057 --> 33:40.392
Let's follow it.

33:42.260 --> 33:44.894
Look over there,
it's Frida the frog,

33:44.896 --> 33:48.530
the best amphibian storyteller
in Fairy Tale Valley.

33:48.532 --> 33:50.101
Let's go see her.

33:54.038 --> 33:55.271
Hello there.

33:55.273 --> 33:57.172
My name is Benny
the Easter Bunny,

33:57.174 --> 33:59.508
and this is my friend Wilma.

33:59.510 --> 34:03.145
We're looking for a
very special Easter egg.

34:03.147 --> 34:05.849
We think it rolled down that
way but before we follow it,

34:05.851 --> 34:09.018
we would love to hear
a story from you.

34:09.021 --> 34:11.920
A wild boar was sharpening
his tusks busily against

34:11.922 --> 34:15.358
the stump of a tree,
when a fox happened by.

34:15.360 --> 34:17.927
Now the fox was always
looking for a chance to make

34:17.929 --> 34:21.164
fun of his neighbors, so he
made a great show of looking

34:21.166 --> 34:25.135
anxiously about, as if in
fear of some hidden enemy.

34:25.137 --> 34:27.603
But the boar kept
right on with his work.

34:27.606 --> 34:32.440
"Why are you doing that?" asked
the fox at last with a grin.

34:32.443 --> 34:34.878
"There isn't any
danger that I can see."

34:34.880 --> 34:38.847
"True enough," replied the
boar, "but when danger does come

34:38.849 --> 34:41.751
"there will not be time
for such work as this.

34:41.753 --> 34:44.320
"My weapons will have to
be ready for use then,

34:44.322 --> 34:46.554
"or I shall suffer for it."

34:46.556 --> 34:49.858
Preparedness for war is the
best guarantee of peace.

34:49.860 --> 34:52.362
That was a great story Frida.

34:52.364 --> 34:54.130
Can you tell us another?

34:54.132 --> 34:56.833
An ass and a fox had
become close comrades,

34:56.835 --> 35:00.135
and were constantly in
each other's company.

35:00.137 --> 35:02.871
While the ass cropped
a fresh bit of greens,

35:02.873 --> 35:05.407
the fox would devour a
chicken from the neighboring

35:05.409 --> 35:09.112
farmyard or a bit of cheese
filched from the dairy.

35:09.114 --> 35:12.014
One day the pair
unexpectedly met a lion.

35:12.016 --> 35:14.217
The ass was very
much frightened,

35:14.219 --> 35:16.418
but the fox calmed his fears.

35:16.420 --> 35:18.787
"I will talk to him," he said.

35:18.789 --> 35:21.791
So the fox walked
boldly up to the lion.

35:21.793 --> 35:24.661
"Your highness," he
said in an undertone,

35:24.663 --> 35:26.795
so the ass could not hear him,

35:26.797 --> 35:28.865
"I've got a fine
scheme in my head.

35:28.867 --> 35:32.369
"If you promise not to hurt
me, I will lead that foolish

35:32.371 --> 35:35.637
"creature yonder into a
pit where he can't get out,

35:35.639 --> 35:38.108
"and you can feast
at your pleasure."

35:38.110 --> 35:41.443
The lion agreed and the
fox returned to the ass.

35:41.445 --> 35:44.947
"I made him promise not
to hurt us," said the fox.

35:44.949 --> 35:48.284
"But come, I know a good place
to hide till he is gone."

35:48.286 --> 35:51.787
So the fox led the
ass into a deep pit.

35:51.789 --> 35:55.391
But when the lion saw that the
ass was his for the taking,

35:55.393 --> 35:58.561
he first of all struck
down the traitor fox.

35:58.563 --> 36:01.630
Traitors may expect treachery.

36:01.632 --> 36:03.833
One more Frida, please.

36:03.835 --> 36:07.470
The birds and the beasts
declared war against each other.

36:07.472 --> 36:09.671
No compromise was possible,

36:09.673 --> 36:12.175
and so they went at
it tooth and claw.

36:12.177 --> 36:15.144
It is said the quarrel
grew out of the persecution

36:15.146 --> 36:19.048
the race of geese suffered at
the teeth of the fox family.

36:19.050 --> 36:22.084
The beasts, too,
had cause for fight.

36:22.086 --> 36:24.720
The eagle was constantly
pouncing on the hare,

36:24.722 --> 36:27.557
and the owl dined daily on mice.

36:27.559 --> 36:29.691
It was a terrible battle.

36:29.693 --> 36:33.295
Now the bat family had not
openly joined either side.

36:33.297 --> 36:35.465
They were a very politic race.

36:35.467 --> 36:38.168
So when they saw the birds
getting the better of it,

36:38.170 --> 36:40.637
they were birds for
all there was in it.

36:40.639 --> 36:43.005
But when the tide
of battle turned,

36:43.007 --> 36:44.807
they immediately
sided with the beasts.

36:44.809 --> 36:47.242
When the battle was over,
the conduct of the bats

36:47.244 --> 36:49.813
was discussed at the
peace conference.

36:49.815 --> 36:53.883
Such deceit was unpardonable,
and birds and beasts made

36:53.885 --> 36:56.985
common cause to
drive out the bats.

36:56.987 --> 37:00.055
And since then the bat
family hides in dark towers

37:00.057 --> 37:04.159
and deserted ruins, flying
out only in the night.

37:04.161 --> 37:06.929
The deceitful have no friends.

37:06.931 --> 37:08.898
We should be on our way.

37:08.900 --> 37:11.800
How about one more
story before we go?

37:11.802 --> 37:15.505
Just as a great bear
rushed to seize a stray kid,

37:15.507 --> 37:18.974
a lion leaped from another
direction upon the same prey.

37:18.976 --> 37:21.911
The two fought furiously
for the prize until they had

37:21.913 --> 37:25.380
received so many wounds
that both sank down unable

37:25.382 --> 37:27.316
to continue the battle.

37:27.318 --> 37:29.985
Just then a fox dashed
up, and seizing the kid,

37:29.987 --> 37:32.287
made off with it as
fast as he could go,

37:32.289 --> 37:35.724
while the lion and the bear
looked on in helpless rage.

37:35.726 --> 37:38.394
"How much better it would
have been," they said,

37:38.396 --> 37:41.264
"to have shared in
a friendly spirit."

37:41.266 --> 37:45.436
Those who have all the toil
do not always get the profit.

37:47.304 --> 37:49.606
I think I'm getting
the hang of this.

37:49.608 --> 37:51.840
I see egg tracks below.

37:51.842 --> 37:55.110
(GASPS) I think the egg
rolled down that-away.

37:55.112 --> 37:56.646
You're doing great Benny.

37:56.648 --> 38:00.083
Hey, look down there
on that tree stump.

38:00.085 --> 38:01.684
There's a squirrel.

38:01.686 --> 38:03.552
That's Quincy the squirrel.

38:03.554 --> 38:05.956
BENNY: Let's go visit him.

38:12.097 --> 38:14.898
A dog had learned to
carry his master's dinner

38:14.900 --> 38:16.499
to him every day.

38:16.501 --> 38:18.735
He was very faithful to
his duty, though the smell

38:18.737 --> 38:21.304
of the good things in
the basket tempted him.

38:21.306 --> 38:23.639
The dogs in the neighborhood
noticed him carrying

38:23.641 --> 38:26.342
the basket and soon
discovered what was in it.

38:26.344 --> 38:28.744
They made several attempts
to steal it from him,

38:28.746 --> 38:30.914
but he always guarded
it faithfully.

38:30.916 --> 38:33.749
Then one day all the dogs in
the neighborhood got together

38:33.751 --> 38:36.019
and met him on his
way with the basket.

38:36.021 --> 38:38.086
The dog tried to
run away from them,

38:38.088 --> 38:40.222
but at last he stopped to argue.

38:40.224 --> 38:42.124
That was his mistake.

38:42.126 --> 38:44.760
They soon made him feel so
ridiculous that he dropped

38:44.762 --> 38:47.597
the basket and seized a
large piece of roast meat

38:47.599 --> 38:49.766
intended for his
master's dinner.

38:49.768 --> 38:52.534
"Very well," he said,
"you divide the rest."

38:52.536 --> 38:56.405
Do not stop to argue
with temptation.

38:56.407 --> 38:59.608
Another story Quincy, please.

38:59.610 --> 39:02.211
A jackdaw chanced
to fly over the garden

39:02.213 --> 39:03.880
of the King's palace.

39:03.882 --> 39:07.249
There he saw with much wonder
and envy a flock of royal

39:07.251 --> 39:10.220
peacocks in all the glory
of their splendid plumage.

39:10.222 --> 39:13.121
Now the black jackdaw was
not a very handsome bird,

39:13.123 --> 39:15.224
nor very refined in manner.

39:15.226 --> 39:17.961
Yet he imagined that all he
needed to make himself fit

39:17.963 --> 39:21.231
for the society of the peacocks
was a dress like theirs.

39:21.233 --> 39:24.200
So he picked up some castoff
feathers of the peacocks

39:24.202 --> 39:27.202
and stuck them among
his own black plumes.

39:27.204 --> 39:30.472
Dressed in his borrowed
finery he strutted loftily

39:30.474 --> 39:32.641
among the birds of his own kind.

39:32.643 --> 39:35.110
Then he flew down into the
garden among the peacocks.

39:35.112 --> 39:37.179
But they soon saw who he was.

39:37.181 --> 39:40.349
Angry at the cheat, they
flew at him, plucked away

39:40.351 --> 39:42.885
the borrowed feathers
and also some of his own.

39:42.887 --> 39:45.887
The poor jackdaw returned
sadly to his former companions.

39:45.889 --> 39:48.490
There another unpleasant
surprise awaited him.

39:48.492 --> 39:51.394
They had not forgotten his
superior airs toward them,

39:51.396 --> 39:53.028
and to punish him,

39:53.030 --> 39:57.367
they drove him away with
a rain of pecks and jeers.

39:57.369 --> 40:00.302
Borrowed feathers do
not make fine birds.

40:00.304 --> 40:01.771
Tell us another.

40:01.773 --> 40:04.807
It happened once upon a
time that a certain Greek ship

40:04.809 --> 40:08.845
bound for Athens was wrecked
off the coast close to Piraeus,

40:08.847 --> 40:10.579
the port of Athens.

40:10.581 --> 40:13.416
Had it not been for the dolphins,
who at that time were very

40:13.418 --> 40:16.753
friendly toward mankind and
especially toward Athenians,

40:16.755 --> 40:18.253
all would have perished.

40:18.255 --> 40:20.255
But the dolphins took
the shipwrecked people

40:20.257 --> 40:22.758
on their backs and swam
with them to shore.

40:22.760 --> 40:25.561
Now it was the custom among
the Greeks to take their pet

40:25.563 --> 40:28.998
monkeys and dogs with them
whenever they went on a voyage.

40:29.000 --> 40:32.501
So when one of the dolphins
saw a monkey struggling

40:32.503 --> 40:35.070
in the water, he
thought it was a man,

40:35.072 --> 40:37.240
and made the monkey
climb on his back.

40:37.242 --> 40:39.909
Then off he swam with
him toward the shore.

40:39.911 --> 40:42.311
The monkey sat up,
grave and dignified,

40:42.313 --> 40:44.213
on the dolphin's back.

40:44.215 --> 40:46.648
"You are a citizen of illustrious
Athens, are you not?"

40:46.650 --> 40:48.217
asked the dolphin politely.

40:48.219 --> 40:50.452
"Yes," answered the
monkey, proudly.

40:50.454 --> 40:53.121
"My family is one of the
noblest in the city."

40:53.123 --> 40:54.990
"Indeed," said the dolphin.

40:54.992 --> 40:57.360
"Then of course you
often visit Piraeus?"

40:57.362 --> 40:59.195
"Yes, yes," replied the monkey.

40:59.197 --> 41:00.697
"Indeed, I do.

41:00.699 --> 41:02.030
"I am with him constantly.

41:02.032 --> 41:03.599
"Piraeus is my
very best friend."

41:03.601 --> 41:06.436
This answer took the dolphin
by surprise, and turning

41:06.438 --> 41:09.972
his head, he now saw what
it was he was carrying.

41:09.974 --> 41:13.075
Without more ado, he dived
and left the foolish monkey

41:13.077 --> 41:15.644
to take care of himself,
while he swam off

41:15.646 --> 41:17.880
in search of some
human being to save.

41:17.882 --> 41:20.115
One falsehood leads to another.

41:20.117 --> 41:21.684
WILMA: We should
leave soon Quincy,

41:21.686 --> 41:24.320
but we would love to
hear one more story.

41:24.322 --> 41:26.956
QUINCY: An ass was feeding
in a pasture near a wood

41:26.958 --> 41:30.492
when he saw a wolf lurking in
the shadows along the hedge.

41:30.494 --> 41:32.829
He easily guessed what
the wolf had in mind,

41:32.831 --> 41:35.264
and thought of a
plan to save himself.

41:35.266 --> 41:38.967
So he pretended he was lame,
and began to hobble painfully.

41:38.969 --> 41:41.903
When the wolf came up, he
asked the ass what had made

41:41.905 --> 41:44.440
him lame, and the ass
replied that he had stepped

41:44.442 --> 41:46.041
on a sharp thorn.

41:46.043 --> 41:49.010
"Please pull it out," he
pleaded, groaning as if in pain.

41:49.012 --> 41:51.514
"If you do not, it might
stick in your throat

41:51.516 --> 41:53.081
"when you eat me."

41:53.083 --> 41:55.117
The wolf saw the wisdom of
the advice, for he wanted

41:55.119 --> 41:58.019
to enjoy his meal without
any danger of choking.

41:58.021 --> 42:00.789
So the ass lifted up his
foot and the wolf began

42:00.791 --> 42:03.726
to search very closely and
carefully for the thorn.

42:03.728 --> 42:07.028
Just then the ass kicked
out with all his might,

42:07.030 --> 42:09.766
tumbling the wolf
a dozen paces away.

42:09.768 --> 42:12.668
And while the wolf was getting
very slowly and painfully

42:12.670 --> 42:15.871
to his feet, the ass
galloped away in safety.

42:15.873 --> 42:18.608
"Serves me right," growled
the wolf as he crept into

42:18.610 --> 42:23.345
the bushes. "I'm a butcher
by trade, not a doctor."

42:23.347 --> 42:25.581
Stick to your own trade.

42:25.583 --> 42:29.421
(TRIUMPHANT ORCHESTRAL MUSIC)

42:32.389 --> 42:34.490
Do you see any clues Wilma?

42:34.492 --> 42:36.659
Yes Benny, look over there.

42:36.661 --> 42:38.327
There is a dent in the grass

42:38.329 --> 42:40.463
and I think the egg
landed there but...

42:40.465 --> 42:41.697
But?

42:41.699 --> 42:43.633
Seems like it rolled
further down the valley.

42:43.635 --> 42:45.066
Let's chase it!

42:45.068 --> 42:46.235
Wait look over there.

42:46.237 --> 42:48.336
It's Genevieve goat.

42:48.338 --> 42:51.608
We should go see
her on our way down.

42:53.378 --> 42:56.979
Some cranes saw a farmer
plowing a large field.

42:56.981 --> 42:59.749
When the work of
plowing was done,

42:59.751 --> 43:02.517
they patiently watched
him sow the seed.

43:02.519 --> 43:05.854
It was their feast,
they thought.

43:05.856 --> 43:10.092
So, as soon as the farmer
had finished planting

43:10.094 --> 43:13.396
and had gone home, down
they flew to the field,

43:13.398 --> 43:16.666
and began to eat as
fast as they could.

43:16.668 --> 43:21.170
The farmer, of course, knew
the cranes and their ways.

43:21.172 --> 43:25.641
He had had experience
with such birds before.

43:25.643 --> 43:29.110
He soon returned to
the field with a sling,

43:29.112 --> 43:31.847
but he did not bring
any stones with him.

43:31.849 --> 43:35.450
He expected to scare the
cranes just by swinging

43:35.452 --> 43:39.822
the sling in the air, and
shouting loudly at them.

43:39.824 --> 43:43.892
At first the cranes flew
away in great terror,

43:43.894 --> 43:47.530
but they soon began to see that
none of them ever got hurt.

43:47.532 --> 43:50.532
They did not even hear the
noise of stones whizzing

43:50.534 --> 43:55.271
through the air, and as for
words, they would kill nobody.

43:55.273 --> 44:00.141
At last they paid no attention
whatever to the farmer.

44:00.143 --> 44:04.613
The farmer saw that he would
have to take other measures.

44:04.615 --> 44:07.450
He wanted to save at
least some of his grain.

44:07.452 --> 44:09.952
So he loaded his
sling with stones.

44:09.954 --> 44:11.987
This had the effect
the farmer wanted,

44:11.989 --> 44:16.159
for from that day the cranes
visited his field no more.

44:17.027 --> 44:19.362
Bluff and threatening words

44:19.364 --> 44:22.798
are of little
value with rascals.

44:22.800 --> 44:27.168
Bluff is no proof that
hard fists are lacking.

44:27.170 --> 44:29.838
I wanna hear more Genevieve.

44:29.840 --> 44:32.708
A rich old farmer, who
felt that he had not many

44:32.710 --> 44:36.746
more days to live, called
his sons to his bedside.

44:36.748 --> 44:41.450
"My sons," he said, "heed
what I have to say to you.

44:41.452 --> 44:45.186
"Do not on any account
part with the estate that

44:45.188 --> 44:49.090
"has belonged to our family
for so many generations.

44:49.092 --> 44:52.663
"Somewhere on it is
hidden a rich treasure.

44:53.831 --> 44:57.800
"I do not know the exact
spot, but it is there,

44:57.802 --> 45:00.403
"and you will surely find it.

45:00.405 --> 45:04.509
"Spare no energy and leave no
spot unturned in your search."

45:06.744 --> 45:10.713
The father died, and no sooner
was he in his grave than

45:10.715 --> 45:14.316
the sons set to work digging
with all their might,

45:14.318 --> 45:17.385
turning up every foot of
ground with their spades,

45:17.387 --> 45:22.090
and going over the whole
farm two or three times.

45:22.092 --> 45:26.295
No hidden gold did they find,
but at harvest time when

45:26.297 --> 45:29.197
they had settled their accounts
and had pocketed a rich

45:29.199 --> 45:32.668
profit far greater than that
of any of their neighbors,

45:32.670 --> 45:36.104
they understood that the treasure
their father had told them

45:36.106 --> 45:39.374
about was the wealth
of a bountiful crop,

45:39.376 --> 45:43.547
and that in their industry
had they found the treasure.

45:46.818 --> 45:49.952
Industry is itself a treasure.

45:49.954 --> 45:52.387
You're an amazing
storyteller Genevieve.

45:52.389 --> 45:54.956
I'm so glad we met you.

45:54.958 --> 45:58.561
Two pots, one of brass
and the other of clay,

45:58.563 --> 46:01.697
stood together on
the hearthstone.

46:01.699 --> 46:05.501
One day the brass pot
proposed to the earthen pot

46:05.503 --> 46:08.570
that they go out into
the world together,

46:08.572 --> 46:12.575
but the earthen pot excused
himself, saying that it would

46:12.577 --> 46:17.112
be wiser for him to stay
in the corner by the fire.

46:17.114 --> 46:21.150
"It would take so little
to break me," he said.

46:21.152 --> 46:23.519
"You know how fragile I am.

46:23.521 --> 46:26.354
"The least shock is
sure to shatter me."

46:26.356 --> 46:29.858
"Don't let that keep you at
home," urged the brass pot.

46:29.860 --> 46:32.094
"I shall take very
good care of you.

46:32.096 --> 46:34.295
"If we should happen
to meet anything hard

46:34.297 --> 46:37.234
"I will step between
and save you."

46:38.635 --> 46:42.037
So the earthen pot at last
consented, and the two set out

46:42.039 --> 46:46.976
side by side, jolting along
on three stubby legs first

46:46.978 --> 46:50.278
to this side, then to that,
and bumping into each other

46:50.280 --> 46:51.914
at every step.

46:51.916 --> 46:54.249
The earthen pot could
not survive that sort

46:54.251 --> 46:56.452
of companionship very long.

46:56.454 --> 47:00.588
They had not gone ten paces
before the earthen pot cracked,

47:00.590 --> 47:05.094
and at the next jolt he
flew into a thousand pieces.

47:05.096 --> 47:07.697
Equals make the best friends.

47:07.699 --> 47:10.566
One more story Genevieve.

47:10.568 --> 47:13.903
There was once a countryman
who possessed the most

47:13.905 --> 47:18.039
wonderful goose you can
imagine, for every day when

47:18.041 --> 47:21.342
he visited the nest, the
goose had laid a beautiful,

47:21.344 --> 47:23.280
glittering, golden egg.

47:26.284 --> 47:28.150
The countryman took
the eggs to market

47:28.152 --> 47:30.519
and soon began to get rich,

47:30.521 --> 47:33.588
but it was not long
before he grew impatient

47:33.590 --> 47:36.224
with the goose because
she gave him only

47:36.226 --> 47:39.228
a single golden egg a day.

47:39.230 --> 47:41.863
He was not getting
rich fast enough.

47:41.865 --> 47:45.266
Then one day, after he had
finished counting his money,

47:45.268 --> 47:48.737
the idea came to him that he
could get all the golden eggs

47:48.739 --> 47:52.775
at once by killing the
goose and cutting it open.

47:52.777 --> 47:57.179
But when the deed was done,
not a single golden egg

47:57.181 --> 48:00.918
did he find, and his
precious goose was dead.

48:02.954 --> 48:07.125
Those who have plenty want
more and so lose all they have.

48:08.559 --> 48:10.793
What a great adventure.

48:10.795 --> 48:15.130
This is the best Easter egg
hunt I've ever been on, ever!

48:15.132 --> 48:18.400
We are close to finding
our special egg too.

48:18.402 --> 48:20.369
Before we leave
Fairy Tale Valley,

48:20.371 --> 48:24.541
let's find Billy the hog and
listen to him tell us a story.

48:31.849 --> 48:33.182
Hello there Billy.

48:33.184 --> 48:36.151
We are on our way to
find the very special

48:36.153 --> 48:38.887
egg of the Wish Bird of Easter.

48:38.889 --> 48:41.090
We really wanted to
hear a story from you

48:41.092 --> 48:43.793
before we completed
our Easter egg hunt.

48:43.795 --> 48:45.827
A wolf, lurking near
the shepherd's hut,

48:45.829 --> 48:49.831
saw the shepherd and his family
feasting on a roasted lamb.

48:49.833 --> 48:52.133
"Aha!" he muttered.

48:52.135 --> 48:54.570
"What a great shouting and
running about there would have

48:54.572 --> 48:56.938
"been, had they caught
me at just the very thing

48:56.940 --> 48:59.374
"they are doing with
so much enjoyment!"

48:59.376 --> 49:02.478
Men often condemn others
for what they see no wrong

49:02.480 --> 49:04.179
in doing themselves.

49:04.181 --> 49:06.548
Another story Billy, please.

49:06.550 --> 49:08.617
A goat strayed
away from the flock,

49:08.619 --> 49:11.019
tempted by a patch of clover.

49:11.021 --> 49:14.690
The goat herd tried to
call it back, but in vain.

49:14.692 --> 49:16.758
It would not obey him.

49:16.760 --> 49:19.628
Then he picked up a
stone and threw it,

49:19.630 --> 49:21.963
breaking the goat's horn.

49:21.965 --> 49:23.798
The goat herd was frightened.

49:23.800 --> 49:28.003
"Do not tell the master,"
he begged the goat.

49:28.005 --> 49:29.671
"No," said the goat,

49:29.673 --> 49:32.407
"that broken horn can
speak for itself."

49:32.409 --> 49:34.709
Wicked deeds will not stay hid.

49:34.711 --> 49:37.813
BENNY: Another
story Billy, please.

49:37.815 --> 49:39.682
BILLY: A miser
had buried his gold

49:39.684 --> 49:41.883
in a secret place in his garden.

49:41.885 --> 49:45.987
Every day he went to the
spot, dug up the treasure,

49:45.989 --> 49:49.891
and counted it piece by piece
to make sure it was all there.

49:49.893 --> 49:53.229
He had made so many trips
that a thief, who had been

49:53.231 --> 49:56.130
observing him, guessed what
it was the miser had hidden,

49:56.132 --> 49:58.400
and one night quietly
dug up the treasure

49:58.402 --> 50:00.034
and made off with it.

50:00.036 --> 50:02.637
When the miser
discovered his loss,

50:02.639 --> 50:05.407
he was overcome with
grief and despair.

50:05.409 --> 50:09.077
He groaned and cried
and tore his hair.

50:09.079 --> 50:12.146
A passerby heard his cries
and asked what had happened.

50:12.148 --> 50:15.351
"My gold, oh my gold."
cried the miser, wildly,

50:15.353 --> 50:17.286
"someone has robbed me."

50:17.288 --> 50:20.421
"Your gold, there in that hole?

50:20.423 --> 50:22.791
"Why did you put it there?

50:22.793 --> 50:24.760
"Why did you not keep it in
the house where you could

50:24.762 --> 50:26.795
"easily get it when
you had to buy things?"

50:26.797 --> 50:29.565
"Buy?" screamed
the miser angrily.

50:29.567 --> 50:31.666
"Why, I never touched the gold.

50:31.668 --> 50:34.135
"I couldn't think of
spending any of it."

50:34.137 --> 50:37.171
The stranger picked
up a large stone

50:37.173 --> 50:39.608
and threw it into the hole.

50:39.610 --> 50:43.412
"If that is the case," he
said, "cover up that stone.

50:43.414 --> 50:47.148
"It is worth just as much to
you as the treasure you lost."

50:47.150 --> 50:51.321
A possession is worth no more
than the use we make of it.

50:52.856 --> 50:55.925
There was once a wolf who got
very little to eat because

50:55.927 --> 50:59.494
the dogs of the village were
so wide awake and watchful.

50:59.496 --> 51:02.363
He was really nothing
but skin and bones,

51:02.365 --> 51:05.266
and it made him very
downhearted to think of it.

51:05.268 --> 51:09.070
One night this wolf happened
to fall in with a fine, fat

51:09.072 --> 51:12.273
house dog who had wandered
a little too far from home.

51:12.275 --> 51:15.577
The wolf would gladly have
eaten him then and there,

51:15.579 --> 51:18.347
but the house dog looked strong
enough to leave his marks

51:18.349 --> 51:20.349
should he try it.

51:20.351 --> 51:22.684
So the wolf spoke very
humbly to the dog,

51:22.686 --> 51:25.253
complimenting him on
his fine appearance.

51:25.255 --> 51:28.123
"You can be as well-fed
as I am if you want to,"

51:28.125 --> 51:29.490
replied the dog.

51:29.492 --> 51:32.327
"Leave the woods; there
you live miserably.

51:32.329 --> 51:35.998
"Why, you have to fight
hard for every bite you get.

51:36.000 --> 51:40.568
"Follow my example and you
will get along beautifully."

51:40.570 --> 51:43.871
"What must I do?"
asked the wolf.

51:43.873 --> 51:46.675
"Hardly anything,"
answered the house dog.

51:46.677 --> 51:50.211
"Chase people who carry
canes, bark at beggars,

51:50.213 --> 51:52.680
"and fawn on the
people of the house.

51:52.682 --> 51:55.516
"In return you will get
tidbits of every kind,

51:55.518 --> 52:00.121
"chicken bones, choice bits
of meat, sugar, cake, and much

52:00.123 --> 52:04.293
"more beside, not to speak
of kind words and caresses."

52:04.295 --> 52:07.563
The wolf had such a beautiful
vision of his coming

52:07.565 --> 52:09.630
happiness that he almost wept.

52:09.632 --> 52:12.101
But just then he noticed that
the hair on the dog's neck

52:12.103 --> 52:15.304
was worn and the
skin was chafed.

52:15.306 --> 52:17.639
"What is that on your neck?"

52:17.641 --> 52:19.907
"Nothing at all,"
replied the dog.

52:19.909 --> 52:21.244
"What, nothing?"

52:22.179 --> 52:24.612
"Oh, just a trifle!"

52:24.614 --> 52:26.615
"But please tell me."

52:26.617 --> 52:28.684
"Perhaps you see the
mark of the collar

52:28.686 --> 52:30.918
"to which my chain is fastened."

52:30.920 --> 52:33.688
"What, a chain?" cried the wolf.

52:33.690 --> 52:36.258
"Don't you go
wherever you please?"

52:36.260 --> 52:39.695
"Not always, but what's the
difference?" replied the dog.

52:39.697 --> 52:42.030
"All the difference
in the world.

52:42.032 --> 52:44.766
"I don't care a rap for your
feasts, and I wouldn't take

52:44.768 --> 52:48.070
"all the tender young lambs
in the world at that price."

52:48.072 --> 52:50.974
And away ran the
wolf to the woods.

52:52.175 --> 52:55.612
There is nothing worth
so much as liberty.

52:57.347 --> 52:58.181
Weehoo!

53:00.550 --> 53:03.054
I see the egg rolled that-away.

53:04.989 --> 53:05.820
Where?

53:05.822 --> 53:07.255
Down that incline.

53:07.257 --> 53:08.523
We're getting close.

53:08.525 --> 53:09.858
How do you know?

53:09.860 --> 53:13.697
My chicken sense. (SQUAWKS)

53:15.599 --> 53:17.099
Look over there.

53:17.101 --> 53:20.334
It's the fast-feathered
storyteller of Fairy Tale Valley,

53:20.336 --> 53:22.338
Miss Betty the barn owl.

53:24.742 --> 53:26.208
Hey there Miss Betty.

53:26.210 --> 53:28.644
My name is Benny the Easter
Bunny, and I'm on a hunt

53:28.646 --> 53:33.115
for the most precious Easter
egg ever with my friend Wilma.

53:33.117 --> 53:36.284
We wanted to come and hear
a story before we find the egg

53:36.286 --> 53:39.253
and must leave
Fairy Tale Valley.

53:39.255 --> 53:40.923
A hare was making
fun of the tortoise

53:40.925 --> 53:42.791
one day for being so slow.

53:42.793 --> 53:45.594
"Do you ever get anywhere?"
he asked with a mocking laugh.

53:45.596 --> 53:47.528
"Yes," replied the tortoise,

53:47.530 --> 53:49.398
"and I get there
sooner than you think.

53:49.400 --> 53:51.432
"I'll run you a
race and prove it."

53:51.434 --> 53:53.836
The hare was much amused at
the idea of running a race with

53:53.838 --> 53:56.905
the tortoise, but for the
fun of the thing he agreed.

53:56.907 --> 53:59.474
So the fox, who had
consented to act as a judge,

53:59.476 --> 54:02.244
marked the distance and
started the runners off.

54:02.246 --> 54:05.113
The hare was soon far out of
sight, and to make the tortoise

54:05.115 --> 54:08.383
feel very deeply how ridiculous
it was for him to try

54:08.385 --> 54:11.887
a race with a hare, he
lay down beside the course

54:11.889 --> 54:14.655
to take a nap until the
tortoise should catch up.

54:14.657 --> 54:17.825
The tortoise meanwhile kept
going slowly but steadily,

54:17.827 --> 54:20.695
and, after a time, passed
the place where the hare

54:20.697 --> 54:23.465
was sleeping, but the hare
slept on very peacefully,

54:23.467 --> 54:25.434
and when at last he did wake up,

54:25.436 --> 54:27.168
the tortoise was near the goal.

54:27.170 --> 54:28.737
The hare now ran his swiftest,

54:28.739 --> 54:31.106
but he could not overtake
the tortoise in time.

54:31.108 --> 54:34.909
The race is not
always to the swift.

54:34.911 --> 54:37.479
A store of honey had been
found in a hollow tree,

54:37.481 --> 54:41.182
and the wasps declared positively
that it belonged to them.

54:41.184 --> 54:44.418
The bees were just as sure
that the treasure was theirs.

54:44.420 --> 54:46.688
The argument grew very
pointed, and it looked

54:46.690 --> 54:49.391
as if the affair could not
be settled without a battle,

54:49.393 --> 54:52.327
when at last, with much
good sense, they agreed

54:52.329 --> 54:54.429
to let a judge
decide the matter.

54:54.431 --> 54:56.498
So they brought the
case before the hornet,

54:56.500 --> 54:59.133
justice of the peace in
that part of the woods.

54:59.135 --> 55:01.836
When the judge called the
case, witnesses declared that

55:01.838 --> 55:04.572
they had seen certain winged
creatures in the neighborhood

55:04.574 --> 55:07.909
of the hollow tree, who hummed
loudly, and whose bodies

55:07.911 --> 55:11.012
were striped, yellow
and black, like bees.

55:11.014 --> 55:13.981
Counsel for the wasps
immediately insisted that

55:13.983 --> 55:17.052
this description fitted
his clients exactly.

55:17.054 --> 55:20.588
Such evidence did not help
Judge Hornet to any decision,

55:20.590 --> 55:23.825
so he adjourned court for
six weeks to give him time

55:23.827 --> 55:25.059
to think it over.

55:25.061 --> 55:27.329
When the case came
up again, both sides

55:27.331 --> 55:29.430
had a large number of witnesses.

55:29.432 --> 55:32.133
An ant was first to take the
stand, and was about to be

55:32.135 --> 55:35.369
cross-examined, when a wise
old bee addressed the court.

55:35.371 --> 55:36.905
"Your honor," he said,

55:36.907 --> 55:39.407
"the case has now been
pending for six weeks.

55:39.409 --> 55:41.376
"If it is not decided soon,

55:41.378 --> 55:43.244
"the honey will not
be fit for anything.

55:43.246 --> 55:46.148
"I move that the bees and
the wasps be both instructed

55:46.150 --> 55:47.749
"to build a honey comb.

55:47.751 --> 55:50.952
"Then we shall soon see to
whom the honey really belongs."

55:50.954 --> 55:53.121
The wasps protested loudly.

55:53.123 --> 55:56.124
Wise Judge Hornet quickly
understood why they did so.

55:56.126 --> 55:59.327
They knew they could
not build a honey comb

55:59.329 --> 56:00.963
and fill it with honey.

56:00.965 --> 56:03.599
"It is clear," said the
judge, "who made the comb

56:03.601 --> 56:05.200
"and who could not have made it.

56:05.202 --> 56:07.302
"The honey belongs to the bees."

56:07.304 --> 56:09.907
Ability proves itself by deeds.

56:11.108 --> 56:13.708
A lark made her nest in
a field of young wheat.

56:13.710 --> 56:16.278
As the days passed, the
wheat stalks grew tall

56:16.280 --> 56:18.746
and the young birds,
too, grew in strength.

56:18.748 --> 56:21.583
Then one day, when the ripe
golden grain waved in the

56:21.585 --> 56:24.452
breeze, the farmer and his
son came into the field.

56:24.454 --> 56:27.222
"This wheat is now ready for
reaping," said the farmer.

56:27.224 --> 56:29.458
"We must call in our
neighbors and friends

56:29.460 --> 56:31.360
"to help us harvest it."

56:31.362 --> 56:34.362
The young larks in their nest
close by were much frightened,

56:34.364 --> 56:37.099
for they knew they would be in
great danger if they did not

56:37.101 --> 56:39.635
leave the nest before
the reapers came.

56:39.637 --> 56:41.903
When the mother lark
returned with food for them,

56:41.905 --> 56:43.838
they told her what
they had heard.

56:43.840 --> 56:46.240
"Do not be frightened,
children," said the mother lark.

56:46.242 --> 56:49.010
"If the farmer said he
would call in his neighbors

56:49.012 --> 56:51.213
and friends to help
him do his work,

56:51.215 --> 56:53.882
"this wheat will not be
reaped for a while yet."

56:53.884 --> 56:57.918
A few days later, the wheat
was so ripe, that when the wind

56:57.920 --> 57:01.490
shook the stalks, a hail of
wheat grains came rustling down

57:01.492 --> 57:03.592
on the young larks' heads.

57:03.594 --> 57:06.228
"If this wheat is not harvested
at once," said the farmer,

57:06.230 --> 57:08.296
"we shall lose half the crop.

57:08.298 --> 57:10.798
"We cannot wait any longer
for help from our friends.

57:10.800 --> 57:13.735
"Tomorrow we must set
to work, ourselves."

57:13.737 --> 57:15.670
When the young larks
told their mother

57:15.672 --> 57:17.773
what they had heard
that day, she said,

57:17.775 --> 57:19.541
"Then we must be off at once.

57:19.543 --> 57:21.776
"When a man decides
to do his own work

57:21.778 --> 57:23.679
"and not depend on anyone else,

57:23.681 --> 57:27.014
"then you may be sure there
will be no more delay."

57:27.016 --> 57:29.885
There was much fluttering
and trying out of wings that

57:29.887 --> 57:32.920
afternoon, and at sunrise
next day, when the farmer

57:32.922 --> 57:36.825
and his son cut down the grain,
they found an empty nest.

57:36.827 --> 57:39.096
Self-help is the best help.

57:40.297 --> 57:42.331
There was once a cat
who was so watchful,

57:42.333 --> 57:45.499
that a mouse hardly dared
show the tip of his whiskers

57:45.501 --> 57:47.536
for fear of being eaten alive.

57:47.538 --> 57:50.871
That cat seemed to be everywhere
at once with his claws

57:50.873 --> 57:52.773
all ready for a pounce.

57:52.775 --> 57:56.378
At last the mice kept so closely
to their dens, that the cat

57:56.380 --> 57:59.347
saw he would have to use
his wits well to catch one.

57:59.349 --> 58:02.351
So one day he climbed up on
a shelf and hung from it,

58:02.353 --> 58:05.519
head downward, as if he
were dead, holding himself

58:05.521 --> 58:07.988
up by clinging to some
ropes with one paw.

58:07.990 --> 58:10.891
When the mice peeped out and
saw him in that position,

58:10.893 --> 58:13.394
they thought he had been
hung up there in punishment

58:13.396 --> 58:14.862
for some misdeed.

58:14.864 --> 58:17.199
Very timidly at first
they stuck out their heads

58:17.201 --> 58:19.568
and sniffed about carefully,
but as nothing stirred,

58:19.570 --> 58:23.338
all trooped joyfully out to
celebrate the death of the cat.

58:23.340 --> 58:26.108
Just then the cat
let go his hold,

58:26.110 --> 58:28.376
and before the mice recovered
from their surprise,

58:28.378 --> 58:30.644
he had made an end
of three or four.

58:30.646 --> 58:33.514
Now the mice kept more
strictly at home than ever,

58:33.516 --> 58:35.851
but the cat, who was
still hungry for mice,

58:35.853 --> 58:37.818
knew more tricks than one.

58:37.820 --> 58:41.055
Rolling himself in flour until
he was covered completely, he

58:41.057 --> 58:44.059
lay down in the flour bin,
with one eye open for the mice.

58:44.061 --> 58:47.362
Sure enough, the mice
soon began to come out.

58:47.364 --> 58:50.465
To the cat it was almost as if
he already had a plump young

58:50.467 --> 58:53.934
mouse under his claws, when
an old rat, who had had much

58:53.936 --> 58:57.938
experience with cats and
traps, and had even lost a part

58:57.940 --> 59:00.876
of his tail to pay for it,
sat up at a safe distance

59:00.878 --> 59:02.978
from a hole in the
wall where he lived.

59:02.980 --> 59:05.679
"Take care!" he cried.
"That may be a heap of meal,

59:05.681 --> 59:08.583
"but it looks to me
very much like the cat.

59:08.585 --> 59:11.987
"Whatever it is, it is wisest
to keep at a safe distance."

59:11.989 --> 59:15.824
The wise do not let themselves
be tricked a second time.

59:15.826 --> 59:16.659
Weehoo!

59:19.195 --> 59:22.363
Wow Wilma, what an adventure.

59:22.365 --> 59:24.132
What do you see now?

59:24.134 --> 59:27.235
I see that we're nearing the
bottom of Fairy Tale Valley.

59:27.237 --> 59:32.039
Soon there will be no place
for the Easter egg to roll.

59:32.041 --> 59:34.242
We're almost there Benny.

59:34.244 --> 59:36.077
Look down there.

59:36.079 --> 59:38.081
It's Buya the hound dog.

59:39.583 --> 59:42.483
Let's go listen to a story.

59:42.485 --> 59:46.322
(TRIUMPHANT ORCHESTRAL MUSIC)

59:51.027 --> 59:52.561
Hello there Buya.

59:52.563 --> 59:55.764
My name is Benny the Easter
Bunny and this is my friend

59:55.766 --> 01:00:00.635
Wilma, and we're hunting
the most amazing Easter egg,

01:00:00.637 --> 01:00:02.170
but before we finish the hunt...

01:00:02.172 --> 01:00:04.606
We would like to
listen to a story.

01:00:04.608 --> 01:00:07.275
One bright morning as the
fox was following his sharp

01:00:07.277 --> 01:00:10.612
nose through the wood in
search of a bite to eat,

01:00:10.614 --> 01:00:13.447
he saw a crow on the
limb of a tree overhead.

01:00:13.449 --> 01:00:17.318
This was by no means the first
crow the fox had ever seen.

01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:20.789
What caught his attention
this time and made him stop

01:00:20.791 --> 01:00:23.691
for a second look, was
that the lucky crow held

01:00:23.693 --> 01:00:26.028
a bit of cheese in her beak.

01:00:27.364 --> 01:00:30.599
"No need to search any farther,"
thought sly Master Fox.

01:00:30.601 --> 01:00:33.168
"Here is a dainty bite
for my breakfast."

01:00:33.170 --> 01:00:36.505
Up he trotted to the foot of
the tree in which the crow

01:00:36.507 --> 01:00:39.206
was sitting, and
looking up admiringly,

01:00:39.208 --> 01:00:42.510
he cried, "Good morning,
beautiful creature!"

01:00:42.512 --> 01:00:45.847
The crow, her head cocked
on one side, watched

01:00:45.849 --> 01:00:49.885
the fox suspiciously, but
she kept her beak tightly

01:00:49.887 --> 01:00:53.354
closed on the cheese and
did not return his greeting.

01:00:53.356 --> 01:00:57.358
"What a charming creature
she is!" said the fox.

01:00:57.360 --> 01:00:59.528
"How her feathers shine!

01:00:59.530 --> 01:01:02.630
"What a beautiful form
and what splendid wings!

01:01:02.632 --> 01:01:06.233
"Such a wonderful bird should
have a very lovely voice,

01:01:06.235 --> 01:01:09.771
"since everything else
about her is so perfect.

01:01:09.773 --> 01:01:12.173
"Could she sing just one song,

01:01:12.175 --> 01:01:14.775
"I know I should hail
her Queen of the Birds."

01:01:14.777 --> 01:01:18.079
Listening to these flattering
words, the crow forgot

01:01:18.081 --> 01:01:21.416
all her suspicion, and
also her breakfast.

01:01:21.418 --> 01:01:24.653
She wanted very much to
be called Queen of Birds.

01:01:24.655 --> 01:01:28.623
So she opened her beak wide
to utter her loudest caw,

01:01:28.625 --> 01:01:32.793
and down fell the cheese straight
into the fox's open mouth.

01:01:32.795 --> 01:01:37.132
"Thank you," said Master Fox
sweetly, as he walked off.

01:01:37.134 --> 01:01:40.769
"Though it is cracked, you
have a voice sure enough.

01:01:40.771 --> 01:01:43.470
"But where are your wits?"

01:01:43.472 --> 01:01:46.340
The flatterer lives
at the expense

01:01:46.342 --> 01:01:48.610
of those who will listen to him.

01:01:48.612 --> 01:01:49.780
Another one.

01:01:50.713 --> 01:01:51.882
Pretty please?

01:01:54.016 --> 01:01:56.083
A traveler had hired
an ass to carry him

01:01:56.085 --> 01:01:58.186
to a distant part
of the country.

01:01:58.188 --> 01:02:00.588
The owner of the ass
went with the traveler,

01:02:00.590 --> 01:02:04.258
walking beside him to drive
the ass and point out the way.

01:02:04.260 --> 01:02:06.860
The road led across
a treeless plain

01:02:06.862 --> 01:02:09.697
where the sun beat
down fiercely.

01:02:09.699 --> 01:02:12.733
So intense did the heat become,
that the traveler at last

01:02:12.735 --> 01:02:16.704
decided to stop for a rest,
and as there was no other shade

01:02:16.706 --> 01:02:20.307
to be found, the traveler sat
down in the shadow of the ass.

01:02:20.309 --> 01:02:23.711
Now the heat had affected
the driver as much as it had

01:02:23.713 --> 01:02:26.880
the traveler, and even more,
for he had been walking.

01:02:26.882 --> 01:02:30.017
Wishing also to rest in
the shade cast by the ass,

01:02:30.019 --> 01:02:32.320
he began to quarrel
with the traveler,

01:02:32.322 --> 01:02:36.057
saying he had hired the ass
and not the shadow it cast.

01:02:36.059 --> 01:02:38.425
The two soon came to blows,

01:02:38.427 --> 01:02:42.664
and while they were fighting,
the ass took to its heels.

01:02:42.666 --> 01:02:47.101
In quarreling about the shadow
we often lose the substance.

01:02:47.103 --> 01:02:49.205
I'd love another story.

01:02:50.641 --> 01:02:53.807
One day, a long time ago,
an old miller and his son were

01:02:53.809 --> 01:02:57.244
on their way to market with an
ass which they hoped to sell.

01:02:57.246 --> 01:03:00.115
They drove him very
slowly, for they thought

01:03:00.117 --> 01:03:01.916
they would have a better
chance to sell him

01:03:01.918 --> 01:03:04.151
if they kept him
in good condition.

01:03:04.153 --> 01:03:06.820
As they walked along the
highway some travelers

01:03:06.822 --> 01:03:08.789
laughed loudly at them.

01:03:08.791 --> 01:03:11.059
"What foolishness," cried one,

01:03:11.061 --> 01:03:13.028
"to walk when they
might as well ride.

01:03:13.030 --> 01:03:15.262
"The most stupid
of the three is not

01:03:15.264 --> 01:03:17.965
"the one you would
expect it to be."

01:03:17.967 --> 01:03:20.735
The miller did not
like to be laughed at,

01:03:20.737 --> 01:03:23.570
so he told his son
to climb up and ride.

01:03:23.572 --> 01:03:26.708
They had gone a little
farther along the road,

01:03:26.710 --> 01:03:29.309
when three merchants passed by.

01:03:29.311 --> 01:03:32.146
"Oh ho, what have we
here?" they cried.

01:03:32.148 --> 01:03:34.715
"Respect old age, young man.

01:03:34.717 --> 01:03:37.084
"Get down, and let
the old man ride."

01:03:37.086 --> 01:03:39.320
Though the miller was not tired,

01:03:39.322 --> 01:03:42.389
he made the boy get down and
climbed up himself to ride,

01:03:42.391 --> 01:03:44.758
just to please the merchants.

01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:47.862
At the next turnstile they
overtook some women carrying

01:03:47.864 --> 01:03:50.331
market baskets loaded
with vegetables

01:03:50.333 --> 01:03:51.932
and other things to sell.

01:03:51.934 --> 01:03:54.601
"Look at the old fool,"
exclaimed one of them.

01:03:54.603 --> 01:03:58.673
"Perched on the ass, while
that poor boy has to walk."

01:03:58.675 --> 01:04:02.443
The miller felt a bit
vexed, but to be agreeable

01:04:02.445 --> 01:04:04.979
he told the boy to
climb up behind him.

01:04:04.981 --> 01:04:08.249
They had no sooner started
out again than a loud shout

01:04:08.251 --> 01:04:10.818
went up from another company
of people on the road.

01:04:10.820 --> 01:04:13.088
"What a crime," cried one,

01:04:13.090 --> 01:04:15.690
"to load up a poor
dumb beast like that.

01:04:15.692 --> 01:04:18.860
"They look more able to
carry the poor creature,

01:04:18.862 --> 01:04:20.862
"than he to carry them."

01:04:20.864 --> 01:04:22.396
"They must be on
their way to sell

01:04:22.398 --> 01:04:24.199
"the poor thing's
hide," said another.

01:04:24.201 --> 01:04:27.668
The miller and his son quickly
scrambled down, and a short

01:04:27.670 --> 01:04:31.072
time later, the market place
was thrown into an uproar

01:04:31.074 --> 01:04:35.677
as the two came along carrying
the donkey slung from a pole.

01:04:35.679 --> 01:04:38.612
A great crowd of people ran
out to get a closer look

01:04:38.614 --> 01:04:40.215
at the strange sight.

01:04:40.217 --> 01:04:44.485
The ass did not dislike being
carried, but so many people

01:04:44.487 --> 01:04:47.521
came up to point at him and
laugh and shout, that he began

01:04:47.523 --> 01:04:50.791
to kick and bray, and then,
just as they were crossing

01:04:50.793 --> 01:04:53.661
a bridge, the ropes
that held him gave way,

01:04:53.663 --> 01:04:56.463
and down he tumbled
into the river.

01:04:56.465 --> 01:04:59.967
The poor miller now
set out sadly for home.

01:04:59.969 --> 01:05:03.771
By trying to please everybody,
he had pleased nobody,

01:05:03.773 --> 01:05:06.574
and lost his ass besides.

01:05:06.576 --> 01:05:10.079
If you try to please
all, you please none.

01:05:12.081 --> 01:05:14.449
A dove saw an ant
fall into a brook.

01:05:14.451 --> 01:05:17.719
The ant struggled in vain to
reach the bank, and in pity,

01:05:17.721 --> 01:05:21.088
the dove dropped a blade
of straw close beside it.

01:05:21.090 --> 01:05:23.891
Clinging to the straw
like a shipwrecked sailor

01:05:23.893 --> 01:05:27.729
to a broken spar, the ant
floated safely to shore.

01:05:27.731 --> 01:05:31.965
Soon after, the ant saw a man
getting ready to kill the dove

01:05:31.967 --> 01:05:35.769
with a stone, but just as he
cast the stone, the ant stung

01:05:35.771 --> 01:05:39.173
him in the heel, so that the
pain made him miss his aim,

01:05:39.175 --> 01:05:43.010
and the startled dove flew
to safety in a distant wood.

01:05:43.012 --> 01:05:45.248
A kindness is never wasted.

01:05:46.349 --> 01:05:47.184
Weehoo!

01:05:49.585 --> 01:05:51.753
(CLUCKS)
Benny, I see it!

01:05:51.755 --> 01:05:55.222
It's the amazing Easter
egg we've been looking for.

01:05:55.224 --> 01:05:56.356
Quick!

01:05:56.358 --> 01:05:59.526
Let's go to it
before it rolls away.

01:05:59.528 --> 01:06:01.162
It can't run away.

01:06:01.164 --> 01:06:03.097
We're at the bottom
of Fairy Tale Valley.

01:06:03.099 --> 01:06:04.201
We made it.

01:06:06.235 --> 01:06:08.135
Look, is that
Annie the honeybee?

01:06:08.137 --> 01:06:09.670
She is.

01:06:09.672 --> 01:06:12.240
I'd love to listen
to another story,

01:06:12.242 --> 01:06:15.376
but what about our
Easter egg hunt?

01:06:15.378 --> 01:06:16.878
We're at the
bottom of the valley,

01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:18.679
no more place for the egg to go.

01:06:18.681 --> 01:06:21.048
So we have time
for another story?

01:06:21.050 --> 01:06:22.516
Sure.

01:06:22.518 --> 01:06:25.286
Hello there, my name
is Benny the Easter Bunny

01:06:25.288 --> 01:06:28.222
and this is my friend Wilma.

01:06:28.224 --> 01:06:32.092
We're on an Easter
egg hunt adventure.

01:06:32.094 --> 01:06:35.095
Our egg is waiting for us
at the bottom of the valley.

01:06:35.097 --> 01:06:37.664
But before we
go to get our egg

01:06:37.666 --> 01:06:39.367
and leave Fairy Tale Valley...

01:06:39.369 --> 01:06:41.034
Will you tell us a story?

01:06:41.036 --> 01:06:44.072
A stray lamb stood
drinking early one morning

01:06:44.074 --> 01:06:46.173
on the bank of a
woodland stream.

01:06:46.175 --> 01:06:49.776
That very same morning a
hungry wolf came by farther

01:06:49.778 --> 01:06:53.180
up the stream, hunting
for something to eat.

01:06:53.182 --> 01:06:55.617
He soon got his
eyes on the lamb.

01:06:55.619 --> 01:06:59.487
As a rule Mr. Wolf snapped
up such delicious morsels

01:06:59.489 --> 01:07:02.824
without making any bones
about it, but this lamb looked

01:07:02.826 --> 01:07:06.159
so very helpless and
innocent that the wolf felt

01:07:06.161 --> 01:07:10.597
he ought to have some kind of
an excuse for taking its life.

01:07:10.599 --> 01:07:12.633
"How dare you paddle
around in my stream

01:07:12.635 --> 01:07:15.403
"and stir up all the
mud." he shouted fiercely.

01:07:15.405 --> 01:07:19.539
"You deserve to be punished
severely for your rashness."

01:07:19.541 --> 01:07:22.976
"But, your highness,"
replied the trembling lamb,

01:07:22.978 --> 01:07:24.345
"do not be angry.

01:07:24.347 --> 01:07:26.179
"I cannot possibly
muddy the water

01:07:26.181 --> 01:07:27.749
"you are drinking up there.

01:07:27.751 --> 01:07:30.651
"Remember, you are upstream
and I am downstream."

01:07:30.653 --> 01:07:34.222
"You do muddy it."
retorted the wolf savagely.

01:07:34.224 --> 01:07:35.722
"And besides,

01:07:35.724 --> 01:07:38.793
"I have heard that you told
lies about me last year!"

01:07:38.795 --> 01:07:41.528
"How could I have done
so?" pleaded the lamb.

01:07:41.530 --> 01:07:44.197
"I wasn't born until this year."

01:07:44.199 --> 01:07:47.034
"If it wasn't you,
it was your brother."

01:07:47.036 --> 01:07:49.336
"I have no brothers."

01:07:49.338 --> 01:07:52.307
"Well, then," snarled the wolf,

01:07:52.309 --> 01:07:54.976
"It was someone in your family
anyway, but no matter who

01:07:54.978 --> 01:07:58.512
"it was, I do not intend to be
talked out of my breakfast."

01:07:58.514 --> 01:08:01.648
And without more words the
wolf seized the poor lamb

01:08:01.650 --> 01:08:04.719
and carried her
off to the forest.

01:08:04.721 --> 01:08:09.023
The tyrant can always find
an excuse for his tyranny.

01:08:09.025 --> 01:08:12.760
The unjust will not listen to
the reasoning of the innocent.

01:08:12.762 --> 01:08:14.963
WILMA: Ooh, tell
us another please.

01:08:14.965 --> 01:08:18.031
ANNIE: A wolf had been
hurt in a fight with a bear.

01:08:18.033 --> 01:08:20.634
He was unable to move
and could not satisfy

01:08:20.636 --> 01:08:22.402
his hunger and thirst.

01:08:22.404 --> 01:08:25.106
A sheep passed by
near his hiding place,

01:08:25.108 --> 01:08:27.075
and the wolf called to him.

01:08:27.077 --> 01:08:29.810
"Please fetch me a drink
of water," he begged,

01:08:29.813 --> 01:08:31.845
"that might give
me strength enough

01:08:31.846 --> 01:08:33.915
"so I can get me
some solid food."

01:08:33.917 --> 01:08:35.950
"Solid food!" said the sheep.

01:08:35.952 --> 01:08:37.751
"That means me, I suppose.

01:08:37.752 --> 01:08:39.853
"If I should bring you a drink,

01:08:39.854 --> 01:08:42.389
"it would only serve to
wash me down your throat.

01:08:42.390 --> 01:08:45.292
"Don't talk to me
about a drink!"

01:08:45.295 --> 01:08:48.763
A knave's hypocrisy is
easily seen through.

01:08:48.765 --> 01:08:52.769
BENNY: Will you tell
us one more story Annie?

01:08:54.037 --> 01:08:56.370
ANNIE: Hares, as you
know, are very timid.

01:08:56.372 --> 01:08:58.872
The least shadow, sends
them scurrying in fright

01:08:58.875 --> 01:09:00.308
to a hiding place.

01:09:00.310 --> 01:09:03.710
Once they decided to die rather
than live in such misery,

01:09:03.712 --> 01:09:07.115
but while they were debating
how best to meet death,

01:09:07.117 --> 01:09:09.884
they thought they heard a
noise and in a flash were

01:09:09.886 --> 01:09:11.986
scampering off to the warren.

01:09:11.988 --> 01:09:14.788
On the way they passed a
pond where a family of frogs

01:09:14.791 --> 01:09:17.424
was sitting among the
reeds on the bank.

01:09:17.426 --> 01:09:20.861
In an instant the startled
frogs were seeking safety

01:09:20.863 --> 01:09:22.263
in the mud.

01:09:22.265 --> 01:09:24.064
"Look," cried a hare,

01:09:24.067 --> 01:09:25.933
"things are not
so bad after all,

01:09:25.935 --> 01:09:30.337
"for here are creatures
who are even afraid of us!"

01:09:30.340 --> 01:09:33.407
However unfortunate
we may think we are,

01:09:33.408 --> 01:09:36.210
there is always someone
worse off than ourselves.

01:09:36.212 --> 01:09:37.944
BENNY: I don't
know what I'd give

01:09:37.947 --> 01:09:39.913
to listen to another story.

01:09:39.916 --> 01:09:43.116
Will you please
tell us one more?

01:09:43.118 --> 01:09:46.453
ANNIE: The fox one day thought
of a plan to amuse himself

01:09:46.456 --> 01:09:49.557
at the expense of the stork,
at whose odd appearance

01:09:49.559 --> 01:09:51.459
he was always laughing.

01:09:51.461 --> 01:09:54.428
"You must come and dine with
me today," he said to the

01:09:54.430 --> 01:09:58.066
stork, smiling to himself at
the trick he was going to play.

01:09:58.068 --> 01:10:00.934
The stork gladly
accepted the invitation

01:10:00.936 --> 01:10:04.272
and arrived in good time and
with a very good appetite.

01:10:04.274 --> 01:10:08.843
For dinner the fox served
soup, but it was set out

01:10:08.845 --> 01:10:12.013
in a very shallow dish,
and all the stork could do

01:10:12.015 --> 01:10:14.781
was to wet the very
tip of his bill.

01:10:14.783 --> 01:10:17.250
Not a drop of soup could he get.

01:10:17.252 --> 01:10:20.420
But the fox lapped it up
easily, and, to increase the

01:10:20.422 --> 01:10:25.058
disappointment of the stork,
made a great show of enjoyment.

01:10:25.060 --> 01:10:28.196
The hungry stork was much
displeased at the trick,

01:10:28.198 --> 01:10:31.598
but he was a calm, even-tempered
fellow and saw no good

01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:33.768
in flying into a rage.

01:10:33.770 --> 01:10:35.870
Instead, not long afterward,

01:10:35.872 --> 01:10:38.839
he invited the fox to
dine with him in turn.

01:10:38.841 --> 01:10:42.242
The fox arrived promptly at
the time that had been set,

01:10:42.244 --> 01:10:44.845
and the stork served
a fish dinner that had

01:10:44.847 --> 01:10:46.680
a very appetizing smell.

01:10:46.682 --> 01:10:51.384
But it was served in a tall
jar with a very narrow neck.

01:10:51.386 --> 01:10:54.589
The stork could easily get at
the food with his long bill,

01:10:54.591 --> 01:10:57.959
but all the fox could do was
to lick the outside of the jar,

01:10:57.961 --> 01:11:00.760
and sniff at the delicious odor.

01:11:00.762 --> 01:11:04.932
And when the fox lost his
temper, the stork said calmly,

01:11:04.934 --> 01:11:07.902
"Do not play tricks on
your neighbors unless

01:11:07.904 --> 01:11:10.937
"you can stand the same
treatment yourself."

01:11:10.939 --> 01:11:11.773
Weehoo!

01:11:14.109 --> 01:11:19.080
There it is, the amazing egg
of the Wish Bird of Easter.

01:11:19.082 --> 01:11:21.816
WILMA: We made
it, we found it!

01:11:21.818 --> 01:11:22.652
Weehoo!

01:11:29.893 --> 01:11:34.361
This was the most incredible
Easter egg hunt adventure ever.

01:11:34.363 --> 01:11:35.595
I agree.

01:11:35.597 --> 01:11:37.430
Tell me Benny, what
will your wish be

01:11:37.432 --> 01:11:39.666
when you open the Easter egg?

01:11:39.668 --> 01:11:41.902
Will it grant me
any wish I desire?

01:11:41.904 --> 01:11:42.736
Yes.

01:11:42.738 --> 01:11:45.106
So what will it be?

01:11:45.108 --> 01:11:47.974
Hu-hu, well I wish to
start this Easter egg hunt

01:11:47.976 --> 01:11:49.244
all over again.

01:11:58.020 --> 01:12:01.256
