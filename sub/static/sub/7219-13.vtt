WEBVTT

00:01.269 --> 00:03.714
<i>Previously on</i> Justified...

00:03.804 --> 00:05.613
You shot the one man
makes a difference to me

00:05.672 --> 00:07.208
and somehow convinced Kendal

00:07.307 --> 00:09.014
to throw away his life to save yours.

00:09.109 --> 00:10.281
Man, you crazy.

00:10.344 --> 00:12.620
- Boyd Crowder is dead?
- Very dead, indeed.

00:12.679 --> 00:14.181
- The other one?
- Darryl Crowe?

00:14.815 --> 00:15.816
You want him?

00:15.883 --> 00:17.885
- I'll find him.
- By sundown tomorrow.

00:17.985 --> 00:20.056
I told them I executed you.

00:20.153 --> 00:21.860
I suggested they get a hotel

00:21.955 --> 00:23.866
while I track down Darryl Crowe.

00:23.957 --> 00:25.231
A friend of mine discovered

00:25.325 --> 00:27.805
what he believes to be
five or six kilos of heroin.

00:27.861 --> 00:29.534
I think they call them "bricks".

00:29.630 --> 00:33.476
Darryl Crowe Jr.
is looking to build a house with those bricks.

00:33.534 --> 00:35.138
We don't want him on felony possession.

00:35.202 --> 00:37.182
We want him on attempted murder.

00:37.237 --> 00:39.979
I thought about your proposal about Boyd.
I'm gonna talk to him.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.713
I'm gonna get him to cooperate.

00:41.808 --> 00:44.584
You're too late. Boyd already cooperated.

00:44.678 --> 00:46.749
Now, I want to know
where we stand on our deal.

00:46.847 --> 00:49.191
You said you'd help us get him.
You didn't get him.

00:49.249 --> 00:52.253
So we'll be proceeding
to bring charges against you ASAP.

00:52.352 --> 00:54.559
Jimmy. You got those last six keys?

00:54.655 --> 00:55.895
I do.

00:55.989 --> 00:58.663
<i>Put them in the ceiling above my desk,
then hit the road.</i>

00:58.725 --> 01:00.102
Yeah, Boyd.

01:01.194 --> 01:02.867
Kendal will be tried for attempted murder

01:02.930 --> 01:05.171
of a federal officer as an adult.

01:05.232 --> 01:06.575
Who did this?

01:06.667 --> 01:08.010
I did.

01:14.741 --> 01:16.379
Everything we've been
through to get them here,

01:16.443 --> 01:18.252
now you want to out them loose.

01:18.345 --> 01:20.450
They can't hang themselves
if we don't give them any rope.

01:20.547 --> 01:22.686
- What about Wendy?
- I want to keep her here a bit.

01:22.749 --> 01:23.784
But if we're not charging her...

01:23.884 --> 01:25.090
We can hold her for a couple of hours.

01:25.185 --> 01:26.220
I know we can hold her.

01:26.286 --> 01:28.061
Just trying to figure out
what it is you're up to.

01:28.121 --> 01:29.259
Hey!

01:29.356 --> 01:30.926
You ain't just
walking away from this bullshit, man.

01:31.024 --> 01:32.059
Easy, now, Darryl.

01:32.125 --> 01:34.230
What, you got
some personal shit against my family, huh?

01:34.294 --> 01:35.864
You want to confess, we'll listen.

01:35.929 --> 01:36.964
Otherwise, you should go.

01:37.064 --> 01:39.101
Yeah, how about
I just smack the shit out of you right here?

01:39.199 --> 01:41.406
Jesus Christ, Darryl.
Would you please not make it worse?

01:41.468 --> 01:42.640
Don't worry. He won't.

01:42.736 --> 01:44.545
Staying out of jail's the whole point.

01:44.605 --> 01:46.778
Yeah, you big and tough
around all these marshals.

01:46.873 --> 01:47.943
Why don't we step outside?

01:48.041 --> 01:49.111
You ain't so big and tough, right?

01:49.209 --> 01:50.279
I ain't your problem, Darryl.

01:50.377 --> 01:52.050
- And what is?
- Kendal is.

01:52.379 --> 01:54.290
He'll be here soon for arraignment.

01:54.381 --> 01:56.554
He hears the full weight
of the charges against him,

01:56.617 --> 01:58.563
I got a feeling his story might change.

01:58.619 --> 01:59.757
We both know what happens then.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.128
I'm gonna tell you what happens then.

02:01.221 --> 02:03.098
I'm gonna go
get that good lawyer I was speaking to.

02:03.156 --> 02:05.500
Ain't no way in hell
y'all are charging him as an adult.

02:05.592 --> 02:07.003
- Let's go, Wendy.
- We're holding her.

02:07.094 --> 02:08.767
- Why?
Because we said so.

02:10.896 --> 02:12.774
I'm gonna go take care of this, Wendy,
all right?

02:12.833 --> 02:14.506
I'll be back soon.

02:16.737 --> 02:19.411
You and me, Raylan.
That's a goddamn promise.

02:28.415 --> 02:30.156
Your brother ain't coming back.

02:30.250 --> 02:32.594
- Go to hell.
- Right now, he's making a list,

02:32.653 --> 02:35.532
and it does not
include coming back to defend your child.

02:35.622 --> 02:36.828
Darryl was right.

02:36.923 --> 02:38.834
That boy makes one awful mistake,

02:38.925 --> 02:41.838
and you're prepared
to throw his entire life away for it.

02:41.928 --> 02:44.033
You're wrong about Darryl.

02:44.131 --> 02:46.008
You're wrong about Kendal.

02:46.099 --> 02:47.942
I'm gonna prove that to you.

03:12.459 --> 03:13.870
Hey, you that other marshal, huh?

03:13.960 --> 03:15.166
Yeah, I'm gonna need
you to keep your hands

03:15.228 --> 03:17.139
where I can see them, Darryl.

03:17.998 --> 03:20.137
I ain't trying to start no shit.

03:20.634 --> 03:22.204
I'm just tired.

03:22.302 --> 03:24.179
I'm trying to see...
ls there a motel around here

03:24.237 --> 03:26.717
I could go catch
a couple, two, three hours of sleep?

03:26.807 --> 03:30.016
Well, there's a Motel 6 over
where the 75 hits the 60.

03:30.077 --> 03:31.647
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

03:31.712 --> 03:34.352
I don't know the area too well.

03:34.414 --> 03:36.257
You think I could follow you?

03:37.217 --> 03:38.321
The way this works, Darryl...

03:38.385 --> 03:40.331
ls I follow you around.

03:40.721 --> 03:42.359
Well, suit yourself.

03:42.856 --> 03:45.666
That car don't
look too good for sleeping, though.

03:46.059 --> 03:48.403
You know, my second tour in Afghanistan...

03:48.495 --> 03:49.599
Yeah?

03:49.696 --> 03:54.839
Me and my spotter
spent four days on a freezing mountain,

03:54.901 --> 03:56.847
just watching this village
where someone thought

03:56.903 --> 03:59.679
Mustafa Mohamed Falhid might be hiding.

04:00.107 --> 04:03.281
So I appreciate your concern, this here?

04:03.376 --> 04:06.016
This may as well
be a slow night in the champagne room

04:06.079 --> 04:07.956
for how comfortably erect I'm gonna be

04:08.048 --> 04:09.755
watching your bitch ass squirm about.

04:09.850 --> 04:11.056
Okay.

04:11.118 --> 04:12.756
You need anything else?

04:13.386 --> 04:14.763
Well, you all catch him?

04:14.855 --> 04:16.926
Oh, you don't want to know
what we did to that guy.

04:20.694 --> 04:22.264
Well, if you want to cuddle,

04:22.362 --> 04:23.739
you know where to find me.

04:23.797 --> 04:24.867
Oh, yeah.

04:25.532 --> 04:27.739
Two knocks, I'll hold you real good.

05:11.478 --> 05:12.957
Drop the gun, Boyd.

05:13.747 --> 05:15.658
Well, that's one way to go.

05:16.583 --> 05:19.427
The other way is I shoot you.

05:20.754 --> 05:23.598
See if I can get your amigo
before he gets me.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.269
You could do that.

05:26.793 --> 05:28.830
But how are you going to get him?

05:45.345 --> 05:46.949
You should know.

05:47.447 --> 05:50.189
Your friend tried to escape to warn you

05:50.283 --> 05:52.456
when he heard your keys in the door.

05:53.053 --> 05:54.327
He's a good man.

05:54.387 --> 05:55.457
He was.

05:56.957 --> 05:58.129
No!

06:04.865 --> 06:09.814
You were told
no bodies could be found in Mexico.

06:10.637 --> 06:16.087
So now the bodies
of those responsible will be found in the US.

06:55.348 --> 06:57.419
Wynn Duffy told us he killed you.

06:57.517 --> 07:00.259
Well, maybe I took
a page from the Book of Mark and have risen.

07:00.353 --> 07:02.594
I wasn't sure, after you saw us,

07:02.689 --> 07:03.895
if you would come back.

07:03.957 --> 07:05.766
Well, Alberto, to be quite honest,

07:05.859 --> 07:07.805
I didn't think that you were in town for me.

07:07.894 --> 07:09.305
Was it that?

07:10.196 --> 07:12.301
Or was it that
you needed these before you ran?

07:12.399 --> 07:13.969
I didn't execute those men in the desert.

07:14.067 --> 07:15.444
You were the one who made promises.

07:15.535 --> 07:17.378
Darryl Crowe is who you want.

07:17.871 --> 07:19.373
We want both of you.

07:19.873 --> 07:21.250
You have until noon.

07:21.308 --> 07:23.652
Deliver him quickly' you die quickly.

07:25.045 --> 07:26.217
Hey.

07:43.997 --> 07:46.910
Well, Mr Yoon has
got you mighty paranoid, don't you think?

07:52.906 --> 07:54.908
I will see everything you send.

07:56.076 --> 07:57.350
Screw with me,

07:57.744 --> 07:59.781
you will be begging for a bullet.

08:05.819 --> 08:06.820
How you doing, Kendal?

08:06.920 --> 08:09.366
Better when
you tell me what the hell I'm here for.

08:09.456 --> 08:11.493
You're a tough kid. I get it.

08:11.591 --> 08:13.366
I'm just here to talk, off the record,

08:13.460 --> 08:15.030
see if there's anything you want to say,

08:15.128 --> 08:16.971
any questions you got
before your arraignment.

08:17.030 --> 08:18.600
- I'm fine.
- Fair enough.

08:19.099 --> 08:21.443
Anything I can get you before we start?

08:21.868 --> 08:23.677
You still got that coffee machine?

08:23.770 --> 08:25.545
The one with the good cocoa?

08:27.540 --> 08:29.850
Yeah, I think that can be arranged.

08:31.111 --> 08:33.148
By the way, a Federal judge has approved

08:33.212 --> 08:35.989
the US Attorney's request
to try you as an adult.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.955
- What?
- You hadn't heard about that?

08:39.385 --> 08:41.229
Yeah, AUSA has decided

08:41.321 --> 08:43.698
you're gonna take the
full weight of your crime.

08:43.789 --> 08:46.202
Means you ain't going to juvie now.

08:46.292 --> 08:47.703
You're looking at 40 years to life,

08:47.794 --> 08:50.297
hard time, federal penitentiary.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.813
I'll get you the cocoa.

09:21.194 --> 09:23.572
Guess it's true what
they say about hard times

09:23.663 --> 09:25.836
showing you who your friends are.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.106
I'm going with them, Ava.

09:29.002 --> 09:31.073
Just felt like I had to tell you to your face.

09:31.171 --> 09:32.445
- Nikki, you know I...
- What I know is,

09:32.539 --> 09:35.110
only two of us
saw Genny come out of that bathroom.

09:35.208 --> 09:38.189
Which means,
if you're not the snitch, then I must be.

09:38.711 --> 09:40.384
I'm sorry, Ava.

09:58.031 --> 10:00.978
Yesterday, your little coven
wouldn't let me get near you.

10:01.067 --> 10:04.071
Today, I walk up. They don't even blink.

10:04.137 --> 10:07.209
Yesterday, you had the Frauleins with you.

10:07.273 --> 10:09.310
My girls were just keeping it fair.

10:09.409 --> 10:13.221
Maybe your girls
realise it don't pay to associate with a snitch.

10:14.114 --> 10:16.993
I didn't snitch.

10:17.450 --> 10:18.986
Others say different.

10:19.085 --> 10:21.964
Well, here we are, just the two of us.

10:23.056 --> 10:25.002
You want to make this our time?

10:25.391 --> 10:27.894
Because it might not go the way you think.

10:45.912 --> 10:48.916
Which of you
think I snitched Genny to the hacks?

10:50.650 --> 10:52.095
Think again.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.861
I didn't snitch when my hair got chopped.

10:56.756 --> 10:58.099
Hey, Gretchen,

10:58.158 --> 11:00.434
I snitch when my hair got chopped?

11:01.427 --> 11:04.203
Oh, you got nothing to say now.

11:05.598 --> 11:06.804
How's that?

11:07.133 --> 11:10.205
Maybe 'cause you're the one
snitched out your own girl.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.313
You must be using your own product,

11:13.373 --> 11:15.046
'cause you saying some crazy shit.

11:15.141 --> 11:18.452
Makes sense,
knowing you come at me yourself,

11:18.511 --> 11:21.549
my old man'll snuff out your beloved brother.

11:21.981 --> 11:24.825
I want you, I'll come get you.

11:24.884 --> 11:26.557
Nah, nah, nah.

11:26.953 --> 11:29.627
You rather have someone else do your dirty.

11:30.290 --> 11:34.170
Word for someone
like that where I'm from is "coward."

11:34.627 --> 11:37.665
Crowder! Get off that goddamn table.

11:40.533 --> 11:42.012
Crowder!

12:03.056 --> 12:04.228
<i>40 years?</i>

12:04.891 --> 12:06.165
Yeah.

12:07.527 --> 12:08.904
That's bullshit.

12:09.662 --> 12:11.699
Oh, I promise you ifs very real.

12:12.098 --> 12:13.839
Nothing you can! handle.

12:14.667 --> 12:18.240
You handled growing up
with Darryl and Danny, you can handle this.

12:18.338 --> 12:20.011
Hell, I saw the way you walked

12:20.073 --> 12:23.680
in the marshal's office
right after you did it like it was nothing.

12:24.344 --> 12:26.790
You're a stone-cold badass, boy.

12:27.180 --> 12:29.126
Yeah, but 40 years?

12:29.716 --> 12:30.751
Let me get those off.

12:30.850 --> 12:33.353
Make it easier for you to drink your cocoa.

12:36.089 --> 12:38.262
Say, what's the first thing you ever killed?

12:38.358 --> 12:40.804
You're from Florida, right?

12:40.893 --> 12:42.372
Gator, maybe.

12:42.428 --> 12:43.634
When I was 11.

12:43.730 --> 12:45.937
I was 11, too, or thereabouts.

12:46.032 --> 12:47.204
Wasn't a gator, though.

12:47.267 --> 12:50.578
Will Hendricks' pig got out of its pen,

12:50.637 --> 12:53.948
went feral, started tearing
up my mama's vegetable patch.

12:54.540 --> 12:56.542
Arlo built the trap, caught it,

12:57.076 --> 13:00.114
gave me a gun, said, "Get 'er done."

13:02.048 --> 13:04.119
You ever see a pig that's gone feral?

13:04.217 --> 13:05.787
Nasty. Tusks grow.

13:05.885 --> 13:07.831
They get dirty, ill-tempered.

13:08.488 --> 13:10.798
They don't look bad from a distance,

13:10.890 --> 13:13.928
but get up close, best watch your ass.

13:15.061 --> 13:16.563
You hook the gator before you...

13:16.629 --> 13:18.074
Danny hooked him.

13:18.131 --> 13:21.169
Wanted to do it himself,
but Darryl said it was my time.

13:21.267 --> 13:22.974
Well, there you are.

13:23.069 --> 13:27.313
Pointing that gun at something
that's staring back at you, right?

13:27.407 --> 13:30.320
Longer I stood there'
the less I wanted to do it.

13:30.410 --> 13:31.616
Not that I had a choice.

13:31.678 --> 13:33.521
Arlo'd tan my hide if I didn't.

13:33.613 --> 13:35.320
Danny called me a pussy.

13:35.448 --> 13:37.860
Ain't about being a pussy, though, is it?

13:39.485 --> 13:41.795
No small thing, taking a life.

13:42.455 --> 13:44.332
Hell, my hand was shaking so bad,

13:44.424 --> 13:46.097
first shot nearly missed.

13:47.427 --> 13:49.373
Pig squealing,

13:49.462 --> 13:51.533
bucking, spraying blood.

13:53.299 --> 13:57.270
Put three more shots just to get it to lay still.

13:59.372 --> 14:01.852
I knew I should have felt good about it,

14:02.475 --> 14:03.715
but I didn't.

14:04.344 --> 14:07.325
Walked home,
stepped through the front door,

14:07.380 --> 14:08.950
and threw up.

14:09.315 --> 14:11.625
That's when Arlo called me a pussy.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.354
He beat the shit out of me, too.

14:15.121 --> 14:17.158
Started thinking
less about what I'd done to that pig

14:17.223 --> 14:19.703
and more about what I'd like to do to Arlo.

14:21.627 --> 14:23.231
Well, did you do it?

14:24.197 --> 14:25.676
Not as such.

14:27.200 --> 14:28.907
I always wondered, though,

14:29.469 --> 14:31.005
if I didn't join the marshals

14:31.070 --> 14:33.482
just to prove something to him,

14:34.207 --> 14:35.743
what a badass I was.

14:37.176 --> 14:38.883
Maybe just to spite him.

14:39.645 --> 14:41.647
He hated me being a lawman.

14:43.216 --> 14:44.593
And I knew.

14:44.684 --> 14:46.857
I knew when I joined that

14:48.154 --> 14:51.067
I might have
to shoot someone in the line of duty.

14:51.157 --> 14:53.228
But first time it happened,

14:54.827 --> 14:57.774
god damn if it wasn't the same feeling,

14:57.864 --> 14:59.434
sick to my stomach.

15:00.333 --> 15:02.438
Just kept asking myself
if there was something

15:02.535 --> 15:05.414
I could have
done different short of pulling my gun.

15:09.108 --> 15:10.849
What was it like for you?

15:11.177 --> 15:13.350
What, the gator? It's a goddamn dinosaur.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.586
- Who gives a shit?
- No, the other day.

15:16.215 --> 15:17.558
- What?
- The other day,

15:17.617 --> 15:19.255
when you shot that man.

15:20.887 --> 15:23.231
Like I said, it was...

15:23.589 --> 15:25.626
All I saw was a star on his belt.

15:27.527 --> 15:29.700
Didn't mean for anybody to get hurt.

15:34.467 --> 15:36.310
Your cocoa's getting cold.

15:46.612 --> 15:49.115
All right. He didn't do it.

15:49.382 --> 15:50.554
No shit.

15:51.117 --> 15:52.494
So what do we do?

15:52.652 --> 15:54.131
You wear a wire.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.434
You get Darryl talking.
He admits to shooting Art,

15:56.489 --> 15:58.162
- Kendal's off the hook.
- Raylan, you listen to me.

15:58.257 --> 15:59.463
I can't wear a wire.

15:59.559 --> 16:01.470
- It's the only chance your boy's got.
- No.

16:01.561 --> 16:03.632
Raylan, if I walk in there to see Darryl

16:03.729 --> 16:06.141
and you guys
are sitting out front in your van,

16:06.232 --> 16:07.506
he's gonna smell it on me.

16:07.600 --> 16:08.977
We hear anything, we go in.

16:09.068 --> 16:11.742
I will be dead by the time the door opens.

16:11.804 --> 16:14.785
Do you understand me?
A wire is not an option.

16:14.841 --> 16:17.253
Well, then you got a problem, don't you?

17:02.655 --> 17:03.963
Yeah.

17:10.530 --> 17:13.568
Like I said,
you ain't gonna find him at Audry's.

17:13.665 --> 17:14.906
The man is laying low.

17:15.001 --> 17:17.845
He's afraid
of retribution for the marshal he shot.

17:31.150 --> 17:33.391
This y'all's first time in the States?

17:35.021 --> 17:37.433
Oh, come on, now.
You ain't got to be like that.

17:37.523 --> 17:39.525
I know you speak English.

17:40.226 --> 17:43.400
Are you gonna
deny a condemned man a little conversation?

17:44.597 --> 17:46.201
We've been here before.

17:46.265 --> 17:48.336
- And you like it?
- Some of it.

17:48.668 --> 17:51.512
Well, that just means
you ain't seen enough of it.

17:51.771 --> 17:54.183
How would you like
to stay here permanently,

17:54.240 --> 17:56.413
start working for the other side?

17:58.411 --> 18:00.516
This is as straight an offer as I can make.

18:00.580 --> 18:03.424
Now, Alberto walks
back in this room, you kill him.

18:03.549 --> 18:07.361
And in exchange,
I make you full partners in my organisation.

18:08.287 --> 18:10.893
I have an opening on my crew,
as you well know.

18:10.957 --> 18:13.699
Now, the first order of business,
we sell that off,

18:13.759 --> 18:15.432
we split the profits,

18:15.528 --> 18:18.304
and we go have us
one hell of a weekend in Las Vegas, Nevada.

18:18.397 --> 18:19.967
Now, you ever been?

18:20.433 --> 18:22.936
Now, some folks say Disneyland is
the happiest place on earth.

18:23.035 --> 18:26.915
Well, I promise those folks ain't never partied
with Boyd Crowder in Sin City.

18:26.973 --> 18:28.475
And all you got to do

18:28.941 --> 18:31.285
is kill one man

18:32.044 --> 18:35.116
who don't give two shits
about either one of you.

18:36.248 --> 18:37.750
Start your life anew.

18:38.217 --> 18:40.561
This is your moment.

18:41.988 --> 18:45.902
Right now. This is your moment.

18:53.666 --> 18:55.839
He says we kill you, he'll give us the dope,

18:55.935 --> 18:57.642
make us his <i>complices.</i>

19:00.439 --> 19:01.975
Quite an offer.

19:02.742 --> 19:04.983
- Anything else?
- Take us to Vegas.

19:06.245 --> 19:08.418
Some drinking, some gambling,

19:08.481 --> 19:10.017
and then you all screw?

19:10.116 --> 19:12.756
You know what your problem is, Alberto?

19:12.818 --> 19:15.424
You just don't know how 10 talk to people.

19:23.129 --> 19:25.131
How many times we been to Vegas?

19:25.264 --> 19:27.335
Six? Seven?

19:27.433 --> 19:28.844
More.

19:28.934 --> 19:31.107
This dude is hilarious, 'Berto.

19:31.637 --> 19:33.981
You sure we can't take him back with us?

19:34.040 --> 19:36.611
We'll put him in a cage, like a parrot.

19:37.043 --> 19:38.954
You have 15 minutes, Boyd.

19:39.545 --> 19:41.547
Something else you would like to try?

19:41.647 --> 19:43.490
I hope it's better than that.

19:54.326 --> 19:55.964
Hey, Sis. How you holding up?

19:56.028 --> 19:57.405
Well, I'd be a whole lot better

19:57.496 --> 19:59.999
if the goddamn
marshals would stop harassing this family.

20:00.066 --> 20:01.340
What now?

20:01.400 --> 20:03.243
You know that
whole thing about trying Kendal as an adult?

20:03.335 --> 20:04.370
That was bullshit.

20:04.470 --> 20:06.040
- You shitting me?
- No.

20:06.138 --> 20:09.142
It was a ploy.
They were trying to trick him into lying,

20:09.208 --> 20:10.516
saying you shot the chief.

20:10.576 --> 20:11.714
Jesus Christ.

20:11.811 --> 20:13.688
<i>Well, I'll tell you what. They crossed the line.</i>

20:13.746 --> 20:15.089
You and I are gonna sue the shit out

20:15.181 --> 20:16.717
of the United States Marshals Service.

20:16.816 --> 20:18.159
A lawsuit? No.

20:18.217 --> 20:20.390
Hey, you gonna
just piss these people off more.

20:20.486 --> 20:22.523
Listen to me, Darryl, okay?

20:22.888 --> 20:25.767
Heroin ain't working out.
Neither's the whorehouse.

20:26.158 --> 20:28.399
<i>Now, I think you and I both
know we ain't long for Kentucky,</i>

20:28.494 --> 20:31.168
and I will be goddamned if
I'm leaving here empty-handed.

20:31.230 --> 20:34.074
This here's our payday.
This is what we've been waiting for.

20:34.166 --> 20:35.509
<i>Right?</i>

20:36.168 --> 20:37.738
I just left the hotel.

20:38.104 --> 20:40.414
I'm gonna stop by Audry's, get a drink.

20:40.539 --> 20:41.882
<i>You gonna be there?</i>

20:41.941 --> 20:43.284
Yeah, I'm here.

20:49.615 --> 20:51.026
Wendy Crowe?

20:51.083 --> 20:52.426
Cut her loose about an hour ago.

20:52.518 --> 20:53.519
What? Why?

20:53.586 --> 20:55.065
Woman knows the truth, still wouldn't help.

20:55.121 --> 20:57.601
She left here in quite a fragile state, though.

20:57.690 --> 20:58.691
Raylan.

20:58.758 --> 21:00.931
Oh, what's the worst could happen?
She does Darryl harm?

21:01.026 --> 21:02.403
More like he does her harm.

21:02.461 --> 21:04.941
Maybe that's not such a bad thing, either.

21:05.264 --> 21:06.709
That boy in there?

21:06.899 --> 21:08.310
She's his mother.

21:08.400 --> 21:09.708
I know.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.248
And I called Tim, gave him the heads up.

21:11.303 --> 21:12.577
Told him to keep an eye out.

21:12.638 --> 21:14.311
Well, Darryl just blew through a red light.

21:14.406 --> 21:16.750
Tim tried to follow, but he got taken out.

21:16.809 --> 21:19.221
He's all right. I'm on my way to get him.

21:19.445 --> 21:20.981
Darryl's in the wind.

21:22.081 --> 21:23.321
Shit.

21:54.313 --> 21:58.159
Time's up, and no word from Mr Crowe.

22:00.753 --> 22:02.926
You have good hunting around here?

22:03.689 --> 22:05.032
Not bad.

22:05.591 --> 22:07.832
My daddy used to
take me and my brother when we was young,

22:07.927 --> 22:09.804
but I didn't much care for it.

22:09.862 --> 22:12.934
Prefer to hunt animals who
have a chance to fight back.

22:13.299 --> 22:15.006
My father took me as well,

22:15.100 --> 22:17.011
to the Sonoran Desert.

22:17.102 --> 22:20.606
Hunting big game,
like scorpions and lizards and whatnot?

22:22.174 --> 22:24.780
Mostly bighorn sheep and mule deer.

22:25.644 --> 22:27.988
We'd spend the morning making our kills,

22:28.047 --> 22:29.685
take them back to our campsite,

22:29.782 --> 22:32.626
where my father taught me how to skin them.

22:38.123 --> 22:40.694
The first cut, you make right down the belly.

22:41.193 --> 22:44.140
Bleed the animal, remove the insides,

22:44.463 --> 22:46.875
careful not to puncture the bladder.

22:47.499 --> 22:50.207
Next, you remove the genitals.

22:51.470 --> 22:52.972
Now...

22:55.040 --> 22:57.179
You are ready to the take the skin.

22:57.243 --> 22:59.985
Cut first at the ankle joints,
snap the tendons,

23:01.146 --> 23:03.251
start to peel back the pelt.

23:03.515 --> 23:06.018
The trick is to remove it in one piece.

23:07.486 --> 23:10.160
It's easiest when the animal is still warm.

23:10.990 --> 23:13.834
You want me shit my pants, Alberto?

23:13.893 --> 23:17.602
'Cause it seems to me, that?! make your job a
hell of a lot more unpleasant.

23:17.696 --> 23:20.575
You see, I know real pain.

23:21.166 --> 23:23.908
Shit you can't even imagine.

23:25.337 --> 23:27.783
Now, you want to put me out of my misery?

23:28.674 --> 23:32.383
How 'bout you stop
running your goddamn mouth

23:33.078 --> 23:35.251
and do whatever it is you got to do.

23:52.131 --> 23:55.408
Seems you have risen
from the grave, Mr Crowder.

23:56.535 --> 23:59.641
He'll meet us, but not here.

24:00.205 --> 24:03.152
He wants to meet
at your woman's place in the country.

24:03.242 --> 24:04.721
Well,

24:05.077 --> 24:07.648
I guess you'd better tell him we'll be there.

24:15.454 --> 24:16.831
What?

24:16.922 --> 24:18.595
You want to tell me what that was in the yard,

24:18.657 --> 24:20.261
what the hell you're thinking?

24:20.326 --> 24:22.829
I'm thinking
I can't let her spread lies about me.

24:22.928 --> 24:24.635
So you call her out?

24:26.165 --> 24:29.908
I'd rather have to face just one enemy
than an entire prison's worth.

24:30.235 --> 24:32.647
Gretchen's got to come back over the top.

24:32.972 --> 24:35.976
She wants to fight, we'll fight.

24:36.442 --> 24:38.422
I'm not just gonna lie down.

24:38.978 --> 24:42.255
Gretchens not planning to fight you.
She plans lo kill you.

24:43.482 --> 24:44.984
She can't do that.

24:45.584 --> 24:46.619
Her brother.

24:46.685 --> 24:47.993
She's been going around, telling everyone

24:48.087 --> 24:49.828
she don't give a shit about her brother.

24:49.922 --> 24:51.094
You're dead.

24:52.358 --> 24:55.601
I were you, I'd keep to the group
areas as much as possible,

24:55.661 --> 24:57.971
shower separate from her and her girls.

25:05.337 --> 25:06.782
Ava.

25:18.784 --> 25:19.854
Hey. hey, hey, hey!

25:19.952 --> 25:22.626
Hey! Hey, break it up! Hey, hey, hey!

25:31.563 --> 25:33.042
This is your woman?

25:33.132 --> 25:34.839
She ain't my woman any more.

25:36.402 --> 25:38.006
But this is her house.

25:38.737 --> 25:39.977
It is.

25:40.572 --> 25:42.347
In my experience, that means not only

25:42.408 --> 25:43.751
should you not be in her house,

25:43.842 --> 25:45.412
she should also have yours.

25:47.012 --> 25:48.992
Hey. The Crowe.

25:49.314 --> 25:51.055
Wait. Don't spook him.

26:02.161 --> 26:03.765
Okay, bring him in.

26:04.329 --> 26:06.866
He tries anything, empty your clips.

26:13.539 --> 26:16.110
Well, bad news, boys.
It's the US Marshal's Service.

26:16.208 --> 26:20.020
In case it weren't obvious,
this is the part where you drop your guns.

26:27.286 --> 26:28.856
Whatever you just said,

26:28.921 --> 26:31.299
now, those are Federal agents out there.

26:31.690 --> 26:33.226
Now, you fire that gun,
that's gonna bring them

26:33.292 --> 26:35.272
in here awful quick, don't you think?

26:35.360 --> 26:36.703
Alberio.

26:37.362 --> 26:38.466
Not a word.

26:47.406 --> 26:49.647
Keep your hands where we can see them.

26:49.741 --> 26:51.118
Marshals.

26:53.045 --> 26:54.115
There a problem here?

26:54.213 --> 26:55.920
What do you think, asshole?

26:56.482 --> 26:59.429
I think we have a boss, just like you.

27:00.719 --> 27:04.257
The difference is, we show up empty-handed,
our boss will kill us.

27:05.891 --> 27:08.497
So, because you are
outgunned and outnumbered,

27:08.660 --> 27:11.300
I'm giving you
one chance to get back into that car

27:11.396 --> 27:12.670
and drive away.

27:13.398 --> 27:16.436
You have three seconds
before we kill every one of you.

27:18.303 --> 27:19.577
If you say so.

27:56.775 --> 27:59.016
- Drop the weapon.
- Darling.

27:59.111 --> 28:00.647
- Drop it.
- I would...

28:01.013 --> 28:03.789
I would raise my hands
and surrender if I could.

28:10.389 --> 28:13.962
Have you ever pulled off a shot like that,
Mr Ranger Sniper?

28:14.459 --> 28:17.963
Good guys don't need to shoot people
with their hands cuffed, Crowder.

28:18.030 --> 28:22.570
Well, you ever want
me to teach you how, you just say the word.

28:22.668 --> 28:24.011
I'll keep that in mind.

28:24.069 --> 28:25.480
And when I say "I'll keep that in mind,"

28:25.537 --> 28:27.744
what I mean is, "Stop talking to me."

28:27.873 --> 28:29.580
Oh, well, let me guess.

28:29.675 --> 28:32.849
You're appreciative
and grateful for my quick-thinking heroics.

28:32.911 --> 28:36.381
Ain't even gonna pretend to be sorry for
walking us into an ambush, are you?

28:36.481 --> 28:37.721
Oh, well, on the contrary.

28:37.816 --> 28:40.387
Now, what I did was keep
Darryl Crowe Jr alive,

28:40.485 --> 28:42.226
thereby ensuring that a 15-year-old boy

28:42.321 --> 28:44.062
doesn't spend the rest of his life behind bars

28:44.156 --> 28:45.658
for a crime his uncle committed.

28:45.724 --> 28:48.227
What you did was use us
to save your own ass.

28:48.327 --> 28:50.705
Well, if my survival is a happy lay-product

28:50.762 --> 28:54.039
of my selfless act, so be it.

28:55.167 --> 28:57.113
You're gonna walk away from all this,

28:57.202 --> 28:59.614
and we're gonna have to live with that.

29:00.172 --> 29:02.778
But I'm gonna go back to Lexington,

29:02.874 --> 29:05.081
take that file Raylan has on you,

29:05.677 --> 29:07.452
and make it my sole purpose on this earth

29:07.546 --> 29:12.188
to ensure you receive every ounce of
punishment you have coming your way,

29:12.251 --> 29:14.094
and then some.

29:15.721 --> 29:17.359
Have a nice day, Boyd.

29:29.901 --> 29:31.437
Shoulder's out again.

29:32.471 --> 29:33.711
Lay back.

29:39.244 --> 29:41.417
You got yourself in one hell of a mess now.

29:41.480 --> 29:43.756
I was trying to get myself out of one.

29:45.384 --> 29:47.728
Better I get shivved in a dark hallway,

29:48.287 --> 29:50.927
bleed to death on a cold prison floor?

29:51.390 --> 29:53.063
Least I'm safe in here.

29:56.295 --> 29:57.467
All right.

29:58.163 --> 29:59.665
It's in. You're good.

30:01.566 --> 30:04.570
So, what you
gonna do when they put you into gen pop?

30:08.140 --> 30:11.280
You got any suggestions? I'm listening.

30:14.012 --> 30:16.515
Well, you being alive is good for business.

30:17.082 --> 30:19.995
So believe me when I tell you,
you got two choices.

30:20.085 --> 30:22.497
Either you spend
the next five years here, in solitary,

30:22.587 --> 30:24.794
which is a death of a different kind,

30:25.490 --> 30:30.599
or you be prepared
to fight, every day, till they let you out.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.480
I'll check on you tomorrow again if I can.

30:54.219 --> 30:55.664
- Hey.
- Hey.

31:01.026 --> 31:03.472
So, they ain't gonna try him as an adult?

31:04.629 --> 31:07.007
That's good news. You want a drink?

31:08.467 --> 31:11.346
No. I don't want a drink.

31:12.003 --> 31:13.380
Something wrong?

31:13.472 --> 31:15.315
Kendal didn't shoot that man.

31:15.507 --> 31:16.542
He tell you that?

31:16.641 --> 31:18.211
Well, he didn't have to.

31:18.310 --> 31:20.881
I know my own goddamn son, Darryl.

31:21.380 --> 31:22.586
You do, huh?

31:22.681 --> 31:24.092
What do you think?

31:26.818 --> 31:29.196
Where'd Hake him for his 10th birthday?

31:30.989 --> 31:33.868
What'd he want more than anything
in the world, and I give it to him?

31:33.925 --> 31:36.064
- I don't know, Darryl.
- That's right.

31:36.661 --> 31:39.665
You don't know, 'cause you wasn't there.

31:41.199 --> 31:43.076
You a deadbeat mom.

31:44.102 --> 31:47.345
Don't know shit about your own son.

31:49.508 --> 31:52.352
You know what
I do know shit about, though, is you.

31:52.511 --> 31:53.922
And I know you did this.

31:54.012 --> 31:55.252
You don't know nothing.

31:55.347 --> 31:58.226
You have no idea
how hard it is to take care of a family.

31:58.283 --> 31:59.956
Taking care of family?

32:00.051 --> 32:02.088
What, you mean like
how you took care of Dilly?

32:02.187 --> 32:03.461
Dilly left us.

32:03.555 --> 32:05.592
No. No, he didn't. That is bullshit, Darryl.

32:05.690 --> 32:07.727
Don't bullshit me. I ain't stupid.

32:07.793 --> 32:10.774
What, you think I wouldn't
understand why you did what you did?

32:10.862 --> 32:12.307
You think I would blame you?

32:12.397 --> 32:16.402
I know that Dilly was gonna drag the rest of
us down with his bullshit.

32:16.468 --> 32:18.038
You were given an impossible job,

32:18.103 --> 32:19.810
Daddy getting killed the way he did.

32:19.905 --> 32:21.782
And hard choices had to be made.

32:21.873 --> 32:23.477
Family business was in trouble.

32:23.575 --> 32:26.112
Yeah, it's not like Danny or Dilly would
have done anything, but...

32:26.211 --> 32:28.122
- Nope.
- Here's what I don't understand, Darryl.

32:28.213 --> 32:29.590
Why didn't you tell me about it?

32:29.648 --> 32:32.219
'Cause you ain't never want to hear nothing!

32:32.551 --> 32:33.996
Right?

32:36.388 --> 32:37.458
I'm sorry.

32:37.556 --> 32:39.661
- No, you ain't!
- Yes, I am.

32:40.258 --> 32:42.898
I abandoned you just
when you needed me most.

32:42.961 --> 32:44.463
I was never there for you.

32:44.563 --> 32:46.133
Leave it all on me.

32:46.231 --> 32:47.505
I'm sorry.

32:49.234 --> 32:50.474
I'm so sorry.

32:50.802 --> 32:53.908
All you were
ever trying to do was keep the family safe.

32:54.573 --> 32:56.177
That's all I was trying to do.

32:56.274 --> 32:57.844
I understand.

32:57.943 --> 32:59.081
I do.

32:59.144 --> 33:03.490
But, Darryl, I'm trying
to tell you right now that I'm here with you.

33:04.282 --> 33:05.761
I understand.

33:06.117 --> 33:09.496
I mean, you just hit back
because they killed Danny.

33:09.588 --> 33:12.592
I mean, you were just trying to do
whatever Daddy would've done.

33:12.657 --> 33:15.001
Things went wrong, and you panicked.

33:15.093 --> 33:18.802
But I'm here to
tell you right now that I am here for you.

33:19.698 --> 33:21.700
I'm here for you, Darryl.

33:22.334 --> 33:23.870
I understand.

33:26.137 --> 33:28.981
I didn't have no idea to shoot the man.

33:30.842 --> 33:32.219
It just happened.

33:34.112 --> 33:37.286
I figured Kendal'd go to juvie, no big deal.

33:38.783 --> 33:39.989
That'd be it.

33:41.453 --> 33:43.558
All this shit just happened.

33:47.893 --> 33:49.236
I'm sorry.

33:50.629 --> 33:52.074
I am.

33:53.331 --> 33:55.004
Thank you, Darryl.

33:56.034 --> 33:57.638
I got what I needed.

34:02.507 --> 34:04.077
You're welcome.

34:06.811 --> 34:09.188
No, I mean, I got what I needed.

34:13.485 --> 34:14.725
You recording me?

34:14.819 --> 34:15.991
Every word.

34:19.991 --> 34:25.339
You a dirty, rotten, nasty bitch.

34:25.764 --> 34:29.177
Well, I guess we all get the
family we deserve, right, Darryl?

34:29.568 --> 34:31.241
You know good and well I ain't gonna let you

34:31.335 --> 34:33.043
walk up out of here with that, right?

34:33.103 --> 34:34.411
What are you gonna do, kill me?

34:35.840 --> 34:37.547
Give me that phone, Wendy,

34:38.275 --> 34:39.721
or I'm gonna take it

34:39.777 --> 34:42.054
and stick it down your goddamn throat.

34:42.246 --> 34:44.853
Well, that'd be
a real ballsy move, wouldn't it, Darryl?

34:47.085 --> 34:49.565
How are you gonna do it without your balls?

34:54.426 --> 34:56.201
You ain't gonna use that.

34:56.527 --> 35:00.874
I trusted Kendal with you, you son of a bitch.

35:02.701 --> 35:04.703
What did I miss?

35:05.403 --> 35:07.383
Hey, man, she got a gun.

35:08.873 --> 35:10.546
Yes, I can see that.

35:10.609 --> 35:12.213
Well, ain't you gonna do something about it?

35:12.277 --> 35:14.382
What do you want me to do, Darryl?

35:14.546 --> 35:15.957
Shoot her?

35:16.548 --> 35:17.959
She's your sister.

35:19.417 --> 35:20.896
She's family.

35:21.386 --> 35:23.923
Man can't come in between family.

35:24.556 --> 35:26.832
Hell' you know that better than anyone.

35:34.265 --> 35:35.573
Wendy.

35:47.178 --> 35:48.623
Wendy.

35:49.914 --> 35:52.417
Now'd be a good time to put that gun down.

36:16.307 --> 36:19.117
Didn't I tell you
you were gonna wish I killed you?

36:21.012 --> 36:23.686
Well, don't you?

36:30.789 --> 36:34.566
<i>IV therapist, 4 east. IV therapist, 4 east.</i>

36:34.659 --> 36:36.866
He's a lot less cranky here
than he is at home.

36:36.961 --> 36:38.907
Well' you should
just get a morphine drip for home.

36:41.299 --> 36:43.973
Hey, Raylan. He woke up last night.

36:44.469 --> 36:45.709
They all treating you all right?

36:45.837 --> 36:47.646
Don't even have to get up to piss.

36:47.706 --> 36:49.652
Well, don't gel loo comfortable.

36:49.708 --> 36:50.982
Not likely.

36:51.509 --> 36:54.422
Well, we promised
Leslie we wouldn't wear him out.

36:55.847 --> 36:56.985
We'll see you tomorrow, chief.

36:57.048 --> 36:58.391
Okay.

36:58.483 --> 37:00.190
- Catch up with you later.
- Yeah.

37:00.251 --> 37:01.992
Loving your parking space, by the way.

37:02.053 --> 37:03.589
You stay out of that.

37:06.925 --> 37:08.734
Did you come to say goodbye?

37:08.993 --> 37:10.370
I think you're gonna be all right.

37:10.428 --> 37:13.898
No. I mean, did you talk to Dan?

37:14.499 --> 37:15.671
Dan? No, why?

37:16.501 --> 37:19.880
Dan Grant said
he had a spot for you down in Florida.

37:21.940 --> 37:23.510
When did this happen?

37:24.175 --> 37:26.712
The day after you asked me to transfer you.

37:28.346 --> 37:30.223
I would have told you sooner,

37:30.682 --> 37:33.424
but I didn't want
to bother you on your vacation.

37:36.187 --> 37:37.632
How's Alison?

37:37.722 --> 37:40.794
I told you, honey.
She came by here before you woke up,

37:40.892 --> 37:42.894
and she left you a lovely card.

37:43.561 --> 37:45.370
I'm gonna lei you boys talk.

37:49.033 --> 37:50.808
Was Darryl Crowe, wasn't it?

37:51.770 --> 37:53.113
Yeah.

37:54.205 --> 37:55.582
Did you kill him?

37:56.374 --> 37:58.251
No, but he's dead.

38:00.779 --> 38:02.224
Act of God?

38:05.416 --> 38:06.724
Thank you.

38:15.660 --> 38:17.162
Get some rest.

38:20.398 --> 38:21.775
I'll see you again before I go.

38:21.833 --> 38:23.107
Darn.

38:27.906 --> 38:30.853
<i>Are you serious? This is...
Is really happening?</i>

38:30.942 --> 38:32.353
Yeah, yeah.

38:32.443 --> 38:33.478
Paperwork's been filed.

38:33.578 --> 38:35.751
Just a matter of routine approvals.

38:36.781 --> 38:39.762
I'll be there, all moved in, in a few weeks.

38:48.193 --> 38:50.833
Please tell me those are tears of joy, Winona.

38:51.763 --> 38:53.174
<i>Yeah.</i>

38:53.264 --> 38:55.039
<i>Did you hear that, sweetie?</i>

38:55.600 --> 38:58.877
<i>Daddy's coming home
so that Mama can finally take a nap.</i>

39:00.038 --> 39:01.039
<i>I know!</i>

39:05.710 --> 39:07.621
God damn, she's beautiful.

39:11.449 --> 39:13.019
Now is not the right time, Raylan.

39:13.117 --> 39:16.894
Real-estate prices in Miami are a touch high,
but I know a realtor.

39:16.988 --> 39:18.365
Wynn Duffy, Katherine Hale,

39:18.456 --> 39:19.730
who, by the way, had my boss murdered

39:19.824 --> 39:20.996
to derail her husbands trial.

39:21.059 --> 39:23.903
Bit of a prick, but still better than
the last one I had to deal with.

39:23.995 --> 39:25.201
What else? Robert Quarles,

39:25.296 --> 39:26.866
bodies in Mexico, narcotics trafficking.

39:26.965 --> 39:28.342
All closed cases.

39:28.399 --> 39:29.969
- The Crowes.
- Including the Crowes.

39:30.034 --> 39:32.207
My report's right there on the desk.

39:32.470 --> 39:33.540
Wendy acted in self-defence.

39:33.638 --> 39:35.675
That's what it says in my report, yes.

39:35.740 --> 39:38.482
She says she and the boy
are also heading to Florida.

39:38.543 --> 39:40.887
I have a feeling our paths won't cross.

39:40.979 --> 39:42.720
You don't see it, do you?

39:42.814 --> 39:44.418
The common thread that runs through it all?

39:44.515 --> 39:48.053
All due respect, if it doesn't have to
do with sunny skies and beaches,

39:48.152 --> 39:49.825
there's nothing for me to see.

39:49.888 --> 39:52.061
The man at the centre of everything.

39:52.190 --> 39:53.999
Who? Me?

39:54.359 --> 39:55.838
Boyd Crowder.

39:57.161 --> 39:58.697
- What?
- You familiar?

39:59.230 --> 40:00.573
Hold up.

40:01.933 --> 40:04.573
You're saying you're
going after Boyd Crowder?

40:05.770 --> 40:07.750
I'm sorry. Have you not been listening?

40:07.839 --> 40:10.080
What are we talking about?
How serious are you?

40:10.174 --> 40:11.585
Coffin serious.

40:11.676 --> 40:13.678
We're going after him under the RICO statute.

40:13.745 --> 40:17.090
We're gonna bury him. 50 years, minimum.

40:17.916 --> 40:19.589
And you want me to help?

40:19.684 --> 40:21.925
Before you go? Yeah.

40:23.788 --> 40:25.893
Well, why didn't you just say so?

40:41.406 --> 40:42.441
Hello?

40:42.540 --> 40:43.712
Hello, Boyd.

40:43.908 --> 40:45.785
I owe you some money
or something, Mr Geist?

40:45.877 --> 40:48.949
On the contrary, I'm calling with good news.

40:49.580 --> 40:51.116
Ava's being released.

40:52.550 --> 40:54.086
I'm sorry. Could you say that again?

40:54.152 --> 40:56.894
Your fiancée is being released from prison.

40:57.956 --> 41:01.062
I don't...

41:01.659 --> 41:03.639
I don't... I don't understand.

41:03.728 --> 41:05.105
<i>Well, first,</i>

41:05.663 --> 41:08.234
her cell mate back at Harlan detention centre

41:08.299 --> 41:10.472
changed her story, decided to come clean.

41:10.568 --> 41:12.605
Then, the guard in question...

41:12.670 --> 41:15.583
- Albert Fekus.
- Recanted his statement.

41:17.909 --> 41:19.513
You still there, Boyd?

41:19.744 --> 41:22.247
Yeah. Yeah, I'm here.

41:22.647 --> 41:24.354
The case fell apart.

41:25.783 --> 41:28.093
I believe she'd like to speak with you.

41:29.087 --> 41:30.259
Put her on.

41:33.124 --> 41:34.262
Boyd?

41:34.325 --> 41:35.963
<i>This really happening?</i>

41:37.028 --> 41:38.371
Looks that way.

41:39.931 --> 41:41.467
Well, can I...

41:42.133 --> 41:44.511
You need... You need a ride or anything?

41:44.602 --> 41:46.445
Geist is already here.

41:47.271 --> 41:49.649
Says he'll take me wherever I need to go.

41:50.375 --> 41:51.786
Well, all right.

41:52.510 --> 41:55.980
I was thinking maybe
I'd go to the country house.

41:56.314 --> 41:57.850
Well, as fate would have it, I'm...

41:57.949 --> 41:59.792
I'm standing on your front porch now.

41:59.851 --> 42:03.731
Well, there's still the paperwork to be done,
and then the drive.

42:04.122 --> 42:06.864
But I should be home in a few hours.

42:07.859 --> 42:09.463
I'll be waiting.

42:33.818 --> 42:35.923
Well, I'll give you two some lime.

42:36.320 --> 42:37.765
Thank you.

42:53.404 --> 42:55.611
Well, I bet it feels good to be home.

42:57.942 --> 42:59.285
Yeah.

43:01.345 --> 43:03.188
Are those bullet holes?

43:05.917 --> 43:09.023
It's been a tough couple of months, Ava.

43:16.360 --> 43:17.703
I...

43:18.062 --> 43:21.100
I had something
that I was supposed to take care of tonight,

43:21.199 --> 43:22.610
but it can

43:23.134 --> 43:25.410
wait until in the morning. Can I...

43:26.604 --> 43:28.481
Can I make you something to eat?

43:28.573 --> 43:30.211
No, you should go ahead.

43:30.775 --> 43:33.119
Be nice to have some time alone.

43:36.714 --> 43:37.784
Okay.

43:43.387 --> 43:45.264
What happens now, Ava?

43:47.291 --> 43:49.168
Where do we go from here?

43:51.996 --> 43:53.441
Now...

43:54.966 --> 43:59.244
I take a bath,
I put on my pyjamas, and I sleep.

44:20.024 --> 44:24.336
Mr Duffy. You're a tough man
to get ahold of these days.

44:24.428 --> 44:26.806
I lied to the cartel on
your behalf, Mr Crowder,

44:26.864 --> 44:29.037
so excuse me if I wasn't answering my phone

44:29.133 --> 44:31.340
till the situation resolved itself.

44:31.435 --> 44:33.506
The situation didn't resolve itself.

44:33.604 --> 44:35.208
I resolved it for you.

44:35.773 --> 44:38.947
Do we need to
check your pockets for cigarettes?

44:39.010 --> 44:42.651
No, ma'am. I decided to leave that
pack at home for the evening.

44:42.713 --> 44:45.023
But there is
a package on the front seat of my truck

44:45.116 --> 44:47.392
should put a smile on both your faces.

44:49.453 --> 44:50.955
Be a peach, Mikey.

44:54.192 --> 44:56.468
So, what are you gonna do now, Boyd?

44:57.128 --> 44:58.664
Well, John F. Kennedy
said, "Effort and courage"

44:58.729 --> 45:00.902
"don't mean anything without
purpose and direction."

45:00.998 --> 45:02.477
I don't have either,

45:02.900 --> 45:05.540
so I'll probably
be laying low for a little while.

45:05.636 --> 45:07.479
Good money in that, is there?

45:08.873 --> 45:10.045
Have a seat, Boyd.

45:10.141 --> 45:12.246
This ain't gonna take but a minute.
I'd rather stand.

45:12.343 --> 45:14.653
Come on, please.

45:16.080 --> 45:17.889
Since you asked me that way.

45:21.052 --> 45:24.056
How much do you know
about me, Mr Crowder?

45:24.155 --> 45:27.534
And, please,
just be frank, 'cause it'll save us both time.

45:28.359 --> 45:30.396
Well, I know
it takes a certain kind of woman to be

45:30.494 --> 45:32.371
married to a man like your husband.

45:32.430 --> 45:34.376
And what kind of woman is that?

45:34.665 --> 45:38.340
Well, I suppose that would depend on your
level of involvement in his affairs.

45:41.105 --> 45:42.448
Keep going.

45:42.540 --> 45:46.750
I don't need a weatherman to tell me which
direction this wind is blowing.

45:46.844 --> 45:48.414
I'm done with heroin.

45:48.746 --> 45:51.454
Well, there are other ways to make money.

45:51.549 --> 45:54.120
The way my luck's
been running lately, ma'am,

45:54.218 --> 45:56.630
I'm most likely not
the man you're looking for.

45:56.721 --> 45:58.098
When Katherine was in charge,

45:58.189 --> 46:00.260
all our luck seemed to change for the better.

46:00.358 --> 46:02.861
You mean when her husband was in charge.

46:16.240 --> 46:17.446
We're good.

46:19.944 --> 46:21.981
Well, I guess that concludes our business.

46:22.079 --> 46:23.717
Not necessarily.

46:25.082 --> 46:27.790
You were lousy at running
heroin, Boyd Crowder.

46:27.885 --> 46:29.728
But from what I'm told,

46:30.721 --> 46:34.066
you are really good at robbing banks.

47:26.444 --> 47:27.946
What'd you tell Boyd?

47:28.779 --> 47:31.453
I didn't tell him anything.
He was busy tonight.

47:32.149 --> 47:34.129
The night you get home.

47:34.785 --> 47:36.628
That's why you wanted to meet?

47:36.687 --> 47:38.462
Ask me about my relationship?

47:38.522 --> 47:41.628
Way this works, I ask you whatever I want.

47:41.692 --> 47:43.672
You tell me everything I ask.

47:45.529 --> 47:47.304
Is this where we're gonna meet?

47:47.365 --> 47:48.810
This is one.

47:49.467 --> 47:52.038
I was surprised you
had that US Attorney come make the offer,

47:52.136 --> 47:53.740
didn't do it yourself.

47:53.838 --> 47:55.078
Standard procedure.

47:55.172 --> 47:59.052
But you made sure to have him tell me it
was because of you I got out.

47:59.143 --> 48:01.646
Ava, we get the feeling you ain't playing ball,

48:01.712 --> 48:03.851
it's gonna be me put you back in.

48:04.815 --> 48:06.522
So you came here to threaten me?

48:06.584 --> 48:08.655
I came here to go over the rules.

48:09.053 --> 48:11.363
How you make a call.
How you record a conversation.

48:11.422 --> 48:13.060
How I send an emergency signal.

48:13.157 --> 48:14.568
What to do if I'm in danger.

48:14.658 --> 48:17.730
Yeah, that Deputy Brooks,

48:18.362 --> 48:19.898
pretty black woman,

48:20.498 --> 48:22.171
she covered all that.

48:23.100 --> 48:24.738
And you're clear?

48:29.173 --> 48:30.584
Then we're good.

48:32.176 --> 48:34.213
I'm scared, Raylan.

48:35.279 --> 48:37.088
Don't be.

48:37.181 --> 48:39.956
Everything's gonna be fine.
