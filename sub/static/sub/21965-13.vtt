00:04.375 --> 00:06.625
we need to replace.

00:06.667 --> 00:07.792
Thanks, guys.

00:07.834 --> 00:10.333
Happy to help, Graham.

00:07.834 --> 00:10.333
Happier to be done.

00:11.542 --> 00:14.166
Cody! How'd soccer tryouts go?

00:14.208 --> 00:16.834
( quietly )

00:14.208 --> 00:16.834
I didn't make the team.

00:16.875 --> 00:18.542
I'm sorry,

00:16.875 --> 00:18.542
what was that?

00:18.583 --> 00:20.417
I didn't make the team.

00:20.458 --> 00:23.083
Aw, bud,

00:20.458 --> 00:23.083
that-that's too bad.

00:23.125 --> 00:24.333
No, no, no,

00:23.125 --> 00:24.333
no, no "too bad."

00:24.375 --> 00:26.667
He just ruined

00:24.375 --> 00:26.667
our family legacy!

00:26.709 --> 00:27.917
Look at

00:26.709 --> 00:27.917
these trophies.

00:27.959 --> 00:29.709
Me, Dad, even Graham.

00:29.750 --> 00:31.667
We had to build a

00:29.750 --> 00:31.667

Every Burns

00:31.709 --> 00:35.208
is a soccer star!

00:35.250 --> 00:37.583
Wait, is soccer the one

00:35.250 --> 00:37.583
where they run back and forth

00:37.625 --> 00:39.333
across the same patch

00:37.625 --> 00:39.333
of grass?

00:39.375 --> 00:41.166
I think that's

00:39.375 --> 00:41.166
called football.

00:41.208 --> 00:43.000
Cody, don't feel bad.

00:43.041 --> 00:45.208
You're good at

00:43.041 --> 00:45.208
lots of other things.

00:45.250 --> 00:47.041
But nothing that counts.

00:47.083 --> 00:49.291
When he's right,

00:47.083 --> 00:49.291
he's right.

00:49.333 --> 00:50.792
Ow. What?

00:49.333 --> 00:50.792
I said he was right!

00:50.834 --> 00:52.375

00:52.417 --> 00:55.125
I want the whole team at

00:55.166 --> 00:57.125
Why, Dad?

00:55.166 --> 00:57.125
Need more tokens?

00:57.166 --> 01:00.792
No, but I could use

00:57.166 --> 01:00.792

07:11.500 --> 07:14.625
Teleportation through

07:11.500 --> 07:14.625
this chamber is the only way

07:14.667 --> 07:16.375
to the Island

07:14.667 --> 07:16.375
of Misfit Technology.

07:16.417 --> 07:20.834
Entanglement-based delivery

07:16.417 --> 07:20.834
without biodigital cloning?

07:20.875 --> 07:23.208
Doc, how'd you build this?

07:23.250 --> 07:24.667
I didn't!

07:24.709 --> 07:28.250
In fact, I don't know who

07:24.709 --> 07:28.250
did...or even how it works.

07:28.291 --> 07:31.542
Good thing my predecessors

07:28.291 --> 07:31.542
left me this instruction manual.

07:31.583 --> 07:33.709
Oh, yeah.

07:31.583 --> 07:33.709
Sounds totally safe.

07:33.750 --> 07:34.959
Enough.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.041
( gasps )

07:37.083 --> 07:38.792
The bull's

07:37.083 --> 07:38.792
failed technology.

07:38.834 --> 07:40.041
Just destroy it.

07:40.083 --> 07:43.083
Ah, but a failure

07:40.083 --> 07:43.083
in one category

07:43.125 --> 07:47.375
may be a success

07:43.125 --> 07:47.375
in another!

07:47.417 --> 07:51.250
For example, nobody thought

07:47.417 --> 07:51.250
mold on an orange was useful,

07:51.291 --> 07:54.083
until a scientist discovered

07:51.291 --> 07:54.083
it was medicine!

07:54.125 --> 07:55.583
( sniffs )

07:55.625 --> 07:59.000
Also, a good way to tell when

07:55.625 --> 07:59.000
it's time to clean the fridge.

07:59.041 --> 08:02.834
Similarly, this machine makes

07:59.041 --> 08:02.834
a horrible nose-hair trimmer,

08:02.875 --> 08:05.750
but on plants,

08:02.875 --> 08:05.750
it's perfect!

08:05.792 --> 08:09.208
That's why we tag everything

08:05.792 --> 08:09.208
we send to the Island.

08:09.250 --> 08:12.417
If we decide later that getting

08:09.250 --> 08:12.417
rid of the tech was a mistake,

08:12.458 --> 08:14.500
we can call it back!

08:14.542 --> 08:16.792
Which is about as likely

08:14.542 --> 08:16.792
as the soccer team

08:16.834 --> 08:18.750
changing their mind

08:16.834 --> 08:18.750
about Cody.

08:18.792 --> 08:21.166
Oh, you-you didn't

08:18.792 --> 08:21.166
make the team?

08:21.208 --> 08:22.875
Why didn't you tell me,

08:21.208 --> 08:22.875
son?

08:22.917 --> 08:25.083
'Cause he's humiliated!

08:25.125 --> 08:27.000
Come on guys,

08:25.125 --> 08:27.000
show him a little sensitivity.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.250
Ow! Would you quit

08:28.000 --> 08:30.250
doing that!

08:30.291 --> 08:33.291
Cody, there's no need

08:30.291 --> 08:33.291
to be ashamed.

08:33.333 --> 08:35.542
Soccer's not

08:33.333 --> 08:35.542
the only sport out there.

08:35.583 --> 08:37.792
It's the only one

08:35.583 --> 08:37.792
that matters.

08:39.917 --> 08:41.959
( bull revving )

08:42.041 --> 08:44.959
Should those optics be glowing?

08:42.041 --> 08:44.959
Hm.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.792
It seems one of the bull's

08:45.000 --> 08:47.792
internal systems is restarting.

08:47.834 --> 08:49.667
I'm on it.

08:55.709 --> 08:59.166
( bull roars )

08:55.709 --> 08:59.166
( grunting )

08:59.208 --> 09:01.458
I'm beginning to think

08:59.208 --> 09:01.458
this guy doesn't like me.

09:01.500 --> 09:04.583
Not you, your color.

09:01.500 --> 09:04.583
Bulls hate the color red.

09:04.625 --> 09:05.875
But that's only a myth.

09:05.917 --> 09:07.458
Somebody

09:05.917 --> 09:07.458
better tell the bull.

09:07.500 --> 09:09.125
Or whoever programmed it.

09:09.166 --> 09:11.792
( bull snorts )

09:09.166 --> 09:11.792
( grunts )

09:11.834 --> 09:15.166
Now I see why they don't let

09:11.834 --> 09:15.166
those things in china shops.

09:15.208 --> 09:19.250
Quickly, get the bull inside

09:15.208 --> 09:19.250
before it damages any machinery!

09:25.208 --> 09:27.583
Hey, bull!

09:25.208 --> 09:27.583
Bull! Over here!

09:30.583 --> 09:32.333
( bull snorts )

09:33.750 --> 09:35.959
Hey! Whoa!

09:33.750 --> 09:35.959
Let go!

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
Doc, shut off the

09:36.000 --> 09:38.000
Beam Box!

09:42.333 --> 09:43.583
Cody!

09:45.291 --> 09:48.917
BULL:

09:45.291 --> 09:48.917
Insert more tokens to

09:45.291 --> 09:48.917
continue the ride!

09:50.750 --> 09:53.917
♪ Got my head on tight

09:50.750 --> 09:53.917
No telling... ♪

09:53.959 --> 09:55.959
Aw, man, my jacket.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.417
Aw, man, my comm link!

09:56.000 --> 09:59.417
Come back!

10:00.250 --> 10:01.458

10:01.500 --> 10:04.583
Scrapmaster Beta online.

10:04.625 --> 10:08.208
Whoa. An early version

10:04.625 --> 10:08.208
of the Scrapmaster.

10:08.250 --> 10:10.500
But why would a trash

10:08.250 --> 10:10.500
compactor be sent here?

10:10.542 --> 10:13.500
Refuse marked for

10:10.542 --> 10:13.500
destruction.

10:13.542 --> 10:16.792
Because it can't tell the

10:13.542 --> 10:16.792
difference between trash and me!

10:21.875 --> 10:24.834
Refuse marked for

10:25.375 --> 10:26.667
Aah!

( grunting )

10:36.709 --> 10:38.083
CHIEF:

10:36.709 --> 10:38.083
Doc, reverse that thing!

10:38.125 --> 10:40.542
Bring Cody back!

10:38.125 --> 10:40.542
I can't!

10:40.583 --> 10:42.583
Cody doesn't have

10:40.583 --> 10:42.583
a recall tag.

10:42.625 --> 10:44.250
Only the bull does.

10:44.291 --> 10:46.542
( in unison )

10:44.291 --> 10:46.542
So bring back the bull!

10:46.583 --> 10:49.291
That won't help unless Cody

10:46.583 --> 10:49.291
is still touching it!

10:49.333 --> 10:51.166
For Cody's sake,

10:49.333 --> 10:51.166
I hope he's not.

10:51.208 --> 10:52.875
That bull is dangerous.

10:52.917 --> 10:54.959
Our best bet

10:52.917 --> 10:54.959
is to send someone

10:55.000 --> 10:56.834
with a new tag

10:55.000 --> 10:56.834
to find Cody.

10:56.875 --> 10:58.625
And that someone is me.

10:58.667 --> 11:00.166
I don't know,

10:58.667 --> 11:00.166
Heatwave.

11:00.208 --> 11:01.917
On TV,

11:00.208 --> 11:01.917
the guy wearing your color

11:01.959 --> 11:03.709
never comes back

11:01.959 --> 11:03.709
from these missions.

11:03.750 --> 11:04.834
It is true that the Bull

11:04.875 --> 11:06.959
does not seem fond

11:04.875 --> 11:06.959
of your red exterior.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.542
I'm not going there for a bull

11:07.000 --> 11:09.542
fight. I'm rescuing Cody.

11:09.583 --> 11:10.792
KADE:

11:09.583 --> 11:10.792
Yeah,

11:10.834 --> 11:13.458
we got this. Heatwave,

11:10.834 --> 11:13.458
transform.

11:13.500 --> 11:14.792
I don't think so.

11:14.834 --> 11:17.458
Cody'll be a lot happier

11:14.834 --> 11:17.458
to see me than you.

11:17.500 --> 11:19.667
What?

11:17.500 --> 11:19.667
What 'cause of the soccer thing?

11:19.709 --> 11:20.667
I was joking.

11:20.709 --> 11:22.417
We're wasting time arguing.

11:22.458 --> 11:23.917

I'll beam you

11:29.208 --> 11:31.000

11:31.041 --> 11:33.542
exactly one minute

11:31.041 --> 11:33.542

you tech reject!

11:54.750 --> 11:56.917
Cody! Cody,

11:54.750 --> 11:56.917
do you copy?

11:56.959 --> 11:59.709
Cody!

11:56.959 --> 11:59.709
Where are you? Cody!

DANI:

12:05.250 --> 12:06.583
Uh, Doc?

12:06.625 --> 12:08.500
You were supposed

12:06.625 --> 12:08.500
to beam a Bot back.

12:08.542 --> 12:10.250
GRAHAM:

12:08.542 --> 12:10.250
That's the Scrapmaster!

12:10.291 --> 12:13.250

12:10.291 --> 12:13.250
it was too dangerous--

12:19.417 --> 12:21.333
Let's see

12:19.417 --> 12:21.333
how it feels about me.

12:21.375 --> 12:24.000
Refuse marked

12:21.375 --> 12:24.000

All right,

13:01.875 --> 13:03.375

13:04.417 --> 13:05.959
But Dad,

13:04.417 --> 13:05.959
what about Cody?

13:06.000 --> 13:07.875
We can't help him

13:06.000 --> 13:07.875
if we're all reduced to scrap.

13:07.917 --> 13:09.333
We need to regroup.

13:14.250 --> 13:16.750
Well, I locked

13:14.250 --> 13:16.750
that hunk of junk inside.

13:18.208 --> 13:19.834
No way

13:18.208 --> 13:19.834
it's coming after us.

13:19.875 --> 13:21.625
Well,

13:19.875 --> 13:21.625
perhaps not.

13:21.667 --> 13:23.667
But now that menace

13:21.667 --> 13:23.667
is trapped inside

13:23.709 --> 13:25.709
with some

13:23.709 --> 13:25.709
very sensitive machinery...

13:25.750 --> 13:27.041

no way to get

Heatwave

13:27.083 --> 13:28.375
and Cody back.

13:28.417 --> 13:31.291
Don't worry.

13:28.417 --> 13:31.291
I have a plan.

Why am I not reassured?

( panting )

13:38.834 --> 13:41.583
Okay. I think

13:38.834 --> 13:41.583
I lost that thing--

Ah!

Ew!

turn these things off

13:52.959 --> 13:55.333
before sending 'em

13:52.959 --> 13:55.333
to the secret island?

13:55.375 --> 13:56.750
I mean,

13:55.375 --> 13:56.750
take the batteries out

13:56.792 --> 13:58.917
or whatever!

13:56.792 --> 13:58.917

I don't like
