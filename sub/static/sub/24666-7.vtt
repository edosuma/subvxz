unique, unlike anywhere else,

01:47.624 --> 01:48.901
cultures all their own...

01:48.936 --> 01:53.458
Kept close, much loved,
but largely misunderstood.

01:57.393 --> 01:59.947
The vast patchwork
of saltwater marshes,

01:59.981 --> 02:02.950
bayous, and prairie land
that make up Cajun Country

02:02.984 --> 02:05.815
is one of those places.

02:05.849 --> 02:06.988
While the rest of the USA

02:07.023 --> 02:09.267
got stitched together
by superhighways,

02:09.300 --> 02:11.510
southwestern Louisiana remained

02:11.545 --> 02:14.341
relatively isolated.

02:14.375 --> 02:17.309
I-10 wasn't completed
until the 1970s,

02:17.344 --> 02:19.173

this part of the state

chain restaurants,

02:24.213 --> 02:27.871
drive-throughs,
and strip malls, but fear not.

02:27.906 --> 02:30.495
It's still magnificently weird.

02:39.538 --> 02:42.472
Take, for example,
Cajun Mardi Gras.

02:42.507 --> 02:45.199
Ordinarily, I loathe
the idea of Mardi Gras.

02:45.234 --> 02:46.994
Any kind of group celebration,

02:47.028 --> 02:48.996
anything festive
involving dancing

02:49.030 --> 02:51.999
fills me with
self-conscious dread.

02:52.033 --> 02:53.725
Thousands of happy drunks

02:53.759 --> 02:55.244
crowded into the French Quarter,

02:55.278 --> 02:57.660
for instance... not for me.

02:57.694 --> 03:01.388
But Cajun Mardi Gras
is another thing entirely...

03:01.422 --> 03:03.666
Closer to the ancient
French tradition,

03:03.700 --> 03:05.909
vaguely more dangerous.

03:05.944 --> 03:09.258
Downright medieval.

03:09.292 --> 03:11.536
Cajuns do things their way...

03:11.570 --> 03:14.021
Always have, always will.

03:14.055 --> 03:15.885
Whether it's hanging on
to the French language

03:15.919 --> 03:17.921
of their ancestors, their music,

03:17.956 --> 03:20.303
traditions, or food,

03:20.338 --> 03:24.928
Cajuns fiercely
keep it all vibrantly alive.

03:27.068 --> 03:30.382
Boudin is a ubiquitous
sausage of Cajun Country,

03:30.417 --> 03:32.867
and judging by the line
up at the drive through,

03:32.902 --> 03:35.974
Billy's Boudin is
pretty damn popular.

03:38.321 --> 03:40.944
So this is a boudin ball

03:40.979 --> 03:42.601
stuffed with pepper jack cheese,

03:42.636 --> 03:46.985
which I believe Billy's is
responsible for its invention.

03:47.019 --> 03:49.401
What's not to like?
Ground-up sausage

03:49.436 --> 03:52.956
and molted cheese,
battered and fried?

03:52.991 --> 03:55.752
Who's gonna hate that?
No one.

03:55.787 --> 03:56.960
In addition to boudin,

03:56.995 --> 03:59.273
breakfast around here
wouldn't be complete

03:59.308 --> 04:03.967
without some cracklins,
and of course, a cold beer.

04:04.002 --> 04:06.004
My father's
first language is French.

04:06.038 --> 04:08.317
I mean, as a kid, for him,

04:08.351 --> 04:11.665
he was whipped at school
for speaking French.

04:11.699 --> 04:14.461
Yeah, I mean, look,
is it fair to say that

04:14.495 --> 04:16.428
at most points in its history,

04:16.463 --> 04:20.293
the Cajuns have been,
if not, a despised minority...

04:20.329 --> 04:23.987
An aggressively
marginalized minority.

04:24.022 --> 04:27.819
Our depiction stops at
swamp scenes and alligators,

04:27.853 --> 04:29.579
and it's so much more
than that...

04:29.614 --> 04:31.781
Not just because of the food,
not just because of the music,

04:31.788 --> 04:33.411
because of the way of life,
you know?

04:33.445 --> 04:37.104
Especially Acadiana...
This is the most European

04:37.138 --> 04:41.004
part of America, in my opinion.

04:41.039 --> 04:42.627

eat well this week?

Yeah, a lot of good food,
a lot of house parties.

- Mm.

Here, it's a
whole different thing.

04:53.016 --> 04:55.364

the major difference is that,

06:29.527 --> 06:32.599
Together with his wife Ann

Marc, here's the question.

06:46.164 --> 06:47.588
How far does your family
go back here?

06:47.614 --> 06:50.064
Well, I think back
to the American Revolution

06:50.099 --> 06:51.652
because the land that we live on

06:51.687 --> 06:54.448
was ceded to
one of our ancestors,

06:54.483 --> 06:58.176
and part of that land
is still in our family today.

06:58.210 --> 07:00.730
How the French-Acadian
pioneers got here

07:00.765 --> 07:05.183
and ended up becoming Cajun
is a long story.

07:05.217 --> 07:07.634
Forcibly deported
by the Protestant British

07:07.668 --> 07:09.463
from their homeland
in Nova Scotia,

07:09.498 --> 07:11.741
the Acadians became refugees,

07:11.776 --> 07:14.468
eventually settling deep
in the mosquito-infested

07:14.503 --> 07:17.160
swamps and flatlands
of Louisiana...

07:17.195 --> 07:20.474
A place nobody else
wanted at the time.

07:20.509 --> 07:22.959
Over the years,
the settlers absorbed,

07:22.994 --> 07:25.168
to varying degrees,
other cultures...

07:25.203 --> 07:28.171
Irish, Spanish, German,
Native American,

07:28.206 --> 07:29.966
and West African, among others,

07:30.001 --> 07:34.488
mutating into a distinctive
culture unlike any other.

07:34.523 --> 07:36.973
So how long has the
family been playing music?

07:37.008 --> 07:38.527
Well,
my grandfather was a fiddler,

07:38.561 --> 07:41.495
but I don't know...
I don't know more than that.

07:41.530 --> 07:43.670

- Yeah.

- I'm running Mardi Gras,

08:03.586 --> 08:04.691

08:04.725 --> 08:06.037
But, you know, in the old days,

It's become insane,
more and more insane.

08:11.249 --> 08:12.761
And every year,
somebody dies in Eunice.

08:12.768 --> 08:15.149
Every single year, there's
one death at the Mardi Gras.

08:15.184 --> 08:16.530
Every year.
But, you know,

08:16.565 --> 08:18.532
you gotta stay away
from the horse's feet.

08:18.567 --> 08:20.569
You know,
like a lot of horse injuries.

08:20.603 --> 08:22.191
Like, their horses...
Right.

08:22.225 --> 08:23.910
Some horses will kick you
in the head or something.

08:23.917 --> 08:25.574

08:35.791 --> 08:37.724
Yeah, this is the last...

You gotta stop everything

before Lent.

they go to church

11:31.449 --> 11:34.003
Yeah, like, if you take
a Cajun to the mountains,

11:34.038 --> 11:37.041
they might get a little woozy.

11:37.075 --> 11:39.388

would be complete

11:39.422 --> 11:41.839

11:41.873 --> 11:44.876
All right,
we fire up the reactor.

11:46.464 --> 11:48.190
Oh, yeah.

11:48.224 --> 11:52.539
- I hope you're ready.
- I'm ready.

11:52.573 --> 11:54.541
I like this... this thing.

11:54.575 --> 11:57.889
Oh, man,
this is my baby right here.

11:57.924 --> 11:59.809
Now, what's the appropriate
term for a crawfish?

11:59.822 --> 12:01.375
Is it crawfish?
Crawdad? Mudbug?

12:01.410 --> 12:02.894
We don't... don't say crawdads.

12:02.929 --> 12:04.061
Here, down here, it's crawfish.

12:04.068 --> 12:06.035
All right.
No other term is acceptable?

12:06.070 --> 12:07.927
I mean, you can call them
little mudbugs if you want,

12:07.934 --> 12:10.246
but we like to just
call them by what they are...

12:10.281 --> 12:11.765
Crawfish.

12:11.800 --> 12:12.897
Okay, so écrevisse
would not be a...

12:12.904 --> 12:14.830
Yeah, écrevisse, yeah,
that's French for crawfish.

12:14.837 --> 12:15.953
Oh, right.
That'll work too?

12:15.976 --> 12:18.910
Yeah, that's good.
Yeah.

12:18.945 --> 12:21.810
Oh, yeah.

12:21.844 --> 12:23.881
Hoo, that's good.

12:23.915 --> 12:25.952
Go for it, man.

12:25.986 --> 12:27.574
And the kids don't need
much convincing.

12:27.608 --> 12:29.258
Oh, they love them,
that's because it's the

12:29.265 --> 12:32.303
first crawfish
of the season for us.

12:37.308 --> 12:38.965
Aww, man, that's pretty.

12:38.999 --> 12:41.312
What is with that
super dark sauce, man?

12:41.346 --> 12:44.142
Yeah, it's, like,
parsnips and celery roots.

12:44.177 --> 12:46.248
Ah, okay.
I get it.

12:46.282 --> 12:49.803
Aw, that's delicious.

12:51.494 --> 12:55.947
What are these guys doing
out there standing in the rain?

12:57.638 --> 13:00.814
And this sounds like
a good idea when drinking...

13:00.849 --> 13:05.094
A rousing game of Stump,
or stumping nails.

13:05.129 --> 13:07.614
Throw a hammer in the air
and drive it down hard,

13:07.648 --> 13:09.927
hopefully onto a nail
rather than a hand

13:09.961 --> 13:13.862
or other extremity,
preferably in the rain.

13:13.896 --> 13:15.235
How dumb do you feel
if you end up at a hospital

13:15.242 --> 13:17.624
with that thing sunk
into your, like, cheek?

13:17.658 --> 13:19.971
- No, that's a...
- Only twice.

13:20.006 --> 13:21.524
Has this happened?
"Only twice?"

13:21.559 --> 13:22.836
Okay, good.

13:22.871 --> 13:24.838
So, like... I like my odds.

13:24.873 --> 13:26.633
Swing it down.

13:26.667 --> 13:28.531
- Yes.
- There you go.

13:30.223 --> 13:32.846
- You got a spark.
- Got a spark.

13:32.881 --> 13:35.849
First shot, first killing.

13:37.989 --> 13:40.992
As night falls,
it's time for more food.

13:41.027 --> 13:42.166
Hot pot.
Hot pot.

13:42.200 --> 13:43.857
I sit down with
Toby and his friends,

13:43.892 --> 13:46.895
Lucius, Megan, and Joleen.

13:46.929 --> 13:49.967
That's catfish coubion.
Rice first, Tony.

13:50.001 --> 13:51.658
Perfect rice.

13:51.692 --> 13:52.970
That's a shrimp stew down there?

13:53.004 --> 13:55.041
- That's shrimp stew.
- What are those?

13:55.075 --> 13:56.490
Those hard-boiled egg?
Yeah.

13:56.525 --> 13:59.148
I gotta ask though,
before I forget.

13:59.183 --> 14:00.909
Now, Mardi Gras's
coming up Tuesday.

14:00.943 --> 14:02.393
- Yeah.
- Yes.

14:02.427 --> 14:05.879
Now, I mean, I've sorta
noticed it's a guy thing.

14:05.914 --> 14:08.433
Most runs, we cannot run...
Women cannot run.

14:08.468 --> 14:11.229
It is very much a boys club.
It always has been.

14:11.264 --> 14:13.680
Do you support this
brutal, fascist regime?

14:13.714 --> 14:17.097
Oh, no, the run that
I Capitan is co-ed.

14:17.132 --> 14:18.927
But that's the exception,
not the rule.

14:18.961 --> 14:20.963
- It is the exception... huge.
- Yeah.

14:20.998 --> 14:22.095
We had a female
the other day go,

14:22.102 --> 14:24.063
"I'm gonna run Mamou."
And I'm like, "No, you're not.

14:24.070 --> 14:25.899
Don't do it.
They don't accept it."

14:25.934 --> 14:28.902
So what'd happen
if you would've showed up?

14:28.937 --> 14:30.179
You get chased off.

14:30.214 --> 14:32.112
- Chased off?
- Yeah.

14:32.147 --> 14:33.942
They're segregated
as far as the sexes,

14:33.976 --> 14:35.288
but there are
two different runs.

14:35.322 --> 14:37.359
Yeah, but that's like
Saudi Arabia, dude.

14:37.393 --> 14:38.705

Yeah, no,
it's backwards here, I mean...

14:40.051 --> 14:41.466
It's very backwards, like,

14:41.501 --> 14:43.710
women don't have a place
in a run of Mardi Gras.

17:52.312 --> 17:53.486
To me...

Keep that language...
That dialect... alive?

17:55.177 --> 17:56.730
That's what makes it Zydeco.

17:56.765 --> 18:00.251
Zydeco's always been influenced
by mainstream music,

18:00.286 --> 18:03.461
but it started as French music,
as Creole music.

18:03.496 --> 18:06.499
And you totally remove that
from the music...

18:06.533 --> 18:08.777
A lot of times it's just
rap with an accordion,

18:08.811 --> 18:10.330
or rock and roll
with an accordion.

18:10.365 --> 18:11.918
You still have the
French-y stuff.

18:52.234 --> 18:54.857
Mm-hmm.

18:54.892 --> 18:57.377

18:57.412 --> 18:59.310
Cajun is a big part
of Louisiana,

18:59.345 --> 19:02.520
but Creole is a big part
of Louisiana too, you know.

19:02.555 --> 19:04.281
Used to be native to Louisiana.

19:04.315 --> 19:05.834
Yeah.

19:05.868 --> 19:07.638
That was the original
meaning, as I had said.

19:07.663 --> 19:10.735
It still has
hundreds of definitions.

19:10.770 --> 19:14.394

it's descendants of slaves

19:14.429 --> 19:15.913

19:15.947 --> 19:18.812
and it deals with the food and
the music.

19:18.847 --> 19:21.367

is a big part of it too.

24:20.907 --> 24:22.730
I guess that's why they
call it fishing and hunting

24:22.737 --> 24:24.704
instead of killing
and catching, you know?

24:24.739 --> 24:26.188
Yep.

24:26.223 --> 24:27.362
Let's, uh,

24:27.396 --> 24:31.159
continue on with the beer
drinking and perverted jokes.

24:31.193 --> 24:33.541
You know?
Indeed.

24:33.575 --> 24:35.888
That's what we came here for.

24:45.587 --> 24:47.313

fresh-baked bread...

24:57.634 --> 24:59.256

24:59.290 --> 25:03.225

family specialties...

25:03.260 --> 25:06.574

25:06.608 --> 25:07.920

25:09.646 --> 25:11.924
Heirloom peas from
Grandpa Larry's garden.

25:11.958 --> 25:15.168
All in all, things
worked out okay in the end.

25:15.203 --> 25:17.688
Bless us, O Lord,
and these, thy gifts,

25:17.723 --> 25:20.346
which we are about to receive
from Thy bounty.

25:20.380 --> 25:24.108
Through Christ, our Lord.
Amen.

25:24.143 --> 25:25.765

Great God, let's eat.

25:27.767 --> 25:30.183
God damn it, let's eat!

25:30.218 --> 25:32.116
You gotta pray
before you cuss, so...

25:32.151 --> 25:33.601
As one does.

25:33.635 --> 25:35.361
It's the order before you do it.

25:35.395 --> 25:37.087
Tony.
We always start with rice.

25:37.121 --> 25:39.323

- Yeah? Let's start with some...

25:39.330 --> 25:41.574

25:41.609 --> 25:42.748
Aww, it's beautiful.

25:42.782 --> 25:45.578
So everybody
excited about tomorrow?

25:45.613 --> 25:47.718
The big day?
Yeah, oh yeah.

25:47.753 --> 25:49.271
And then how many days
to recover?

25:49.306 --> 25:51.204
Well, we have
the whole Lent to recover.

25:51.239 --> 25:52.723
- Yeah.
- Right.

25:52.758 --> 25:55.208
- There you go.
- Thank you.

25:55.243 --> 25:59.316
The music and the food are
part of what makes us Cajun.

25:59.350 --> 26:01.387
And the Mardi Gras
is a very important part

26:01.421 --> 26:02.802
of who we are as a people.

26:02.837 --> 26:04.908
So we keeping
those traditions going.

26:04.942 --> 26:07.255
We're in the fifth...
Starting the fifth generation

26:07.289 --> 26:10.672
of my family running Mardi Gras.

26:10.707 --> 26:12.605
How far back
does the tradition go,

26:12.640 --> 26:14.918
and where did it all start?

26:14.952 --> 26:16.885
Back in the 16th century,

26:16.920 --> 26:18.715
and it wasn't called
Mardi Gras then.

26:18.749 --> 26:21.787
But it was because our ancestors

26:21.821 --> 26:23.823
who were not invited
to the king's party

26:23.858 --> 26:26.343
'cause he invited only
the wealthy people

26:26.377 --> 26:27.931
and the church hierarchy.

26:27.965 --> 26:30.761
So our people would do
a street party of their own.

26:30.796 --> 26:32.901
So what started out as
a genuine need for food...

26:32.936 --> 26:34.662
And a way to get it.
That's true.

26:34.696 --> 26:36.698
One day a year that
you could get it,

26:36.733 --> 26:38.079
and as I understand it,

26:38.113 --> 26:41.323
it was kinda license
to mock the people you were...

26:41.358 --> 26:42.386
Who were leaving you
out of the party.

26:42.393 --> 26:44.844
That's where the tall,
conical hats come from...

26:44.879 --> 26:46.708
In mockery of the Queen.

26:46.743 --> 26:47.944
They were proud people and
they wanted to be recognized.

26:47.951 --> 26:49.849
That's why they
disguised their face,

26:49.884 --> 26:53.370
and not to feel like
they were taking charity.

26:53.404 --> 26:55.337
- Mm-hmm.
- So they put on a performance.

26:55.372 --> 26:56.856
- You got a little...
- Here you go.

26:56.891 --> 26:59.376
So at each home that we stop at,

26:59.410 --> 27:00.853
there's, like,
a little party that goes on.

27:00.860 --> 27:02.759
Right,
so they knew you were coming,

27:02.793 --> 27:04.754
and you knew you were expected.
It's already prearranged.

27:04.761 --> 27:06.307
Like, they know we're coming,
they have a chicken,

27:06.314 --> 27:08.143
and they cook something and...

27:08.178 --> 27:10.042
So if I knew you were coming,

27:10.076 --> 27:13.148
what would the
appropriate preparations be?

27:13.183 --> 27:14.667
I should have some food on hand?

27:14.702 --> 27:16.289
You could throw money,

27:16.324 --> 27:17.808
you could donate
a couple chickens

27:17.843 --> 27:19.154
that they could chase and grab.

27:19.189 --> 27:20.673
Right.

27:20.708 --> 27:22.047
Basically just
board up the windows,

27:22.054 --> 27:25.160
and make like there's
a hurricane coming.

27:25.195 --> 27:26.886
Open up the barn,

27:26.921 --> 27:28.819
put everything in the barn,
lock the barn.

27:28.854 --> 27:29.717
Mm-hmm.

27:29.751 --> 27:32.685
I'm talking about
down to a shovel.

27:32.720 --> 27:34.204
If a Mardi Gras finds a shovel

27:34.238 --> 27:36.309
just leaning up against
the back of the house,

27:36.344 --> 27:37.828
they're gonna grab it,
dig a hole,

27:37.863 --> 27:39.416
and bury another Mardi Gras.

27:39.450 --> 27:40.866
- Or me.
- I know.

27:40.900 --> 27:44.041
I will be taking part in
the Mardi Gras run this year,

27:44.076 --> 27:46.699
and one does not interject
one's self among hundreds

27:46.734 --> 27:50.323
of drunk Cajuns
without proper attire.

27:50.358 --> 27:53.879
Fortunately, Grandma Jackie is
one of the premier couturiers

27:53.913 --> 27:56.260
of such specialty garb
in these parts.

27:56.295 --> 27:59.885
How many masks and outfits
do you do a year?

27:59.919 --> 28:02.232
Masks...
I guess I made about 50.

28:02.266 --> 28:04.061
I usually have 50 or 60 a year.

28:04.096 --> 28:05.753
So you're working on those
all year long?

28:05.787 --> 28:07.893
Um, well, yes.

28:09.480 --> 28:12.760
Jackie has created
a signature nose

28:12.794 --> 28:14.306
that's unique to her...
Basically, yeah.

28:14.313 --> 28:16.004
- That she's known for.
- Ah.

28:21.044 --> 28:23.046
A lot of people just say,
"I want a suit."

28:23.080 --> 28:24.765
Or if I have one, they say,
"Ooh, I like this.

28:24.772 --> 28:26.187
I like this one."
Right.

28:26.221 --> 28:27.844
Now, if they
come to me and they say,

28:27.878 --> 28:29.915
"I want the Saints," or, "LSU,"

28:29.949 --> 28:32.538
