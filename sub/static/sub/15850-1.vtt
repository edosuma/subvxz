01:36.562 --> 01:39.497
In St. Petersburg, Florida,
this 52-year-old man

01:39.565 --> 01:43.592
Iets these two young women
into the house.

01:43.703 --> 01:47.639
They lifted up their tops,
exposed themselves to the guy...

01:47.707 --> 01:48.935
Chief Whitlock.

01:49.041 --> 01:53.478
Chief Whitlock, it's Ann.
Ann Merai Harrison.

01:54.547 --> 01:56.640
Somebody just
broke into my house.

01:56.716 --> 01:58.547
All right. Be right over, ma'am.

02:25.144 --> 02:26.771
How you doing, Miss Harrison?

02:27.480 --> 02:28.640
Chief.

02:29.482 --> 02:31.416
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

02:31.484 --> 02:32.746
Mind if I come in?

02:32.818 --> 02:34.080
- Come in.
- Thank you.

02:35.988 --> 02:37.819
Oh, boy.

02:41.494 --> 02:45.760
Did you get a good look
at this fellow?

02:46.332 --> 02:47.594
Yeah.

02:48.834 --> 02:51.598
He was about your height.

02:53.706 --> 02:55.173
Your weight.

02:55.274 --> 02:57.640
Come to think of it,
he kind of looked like you.

02:57.710 --> 02:59.837
Looked like me?
So he was good-looking?

02:59.912 --> 03:00.844
No.

03:02.348 --> 03:04.248
Sorry. Just not my type.

03:05.985 --> 03:10.718
So this "ugly" man-
you know how he got in the house?

03:13.759 --> 03:15.124
The bedroom window.

03:28.441 --> 03:30.568
It's all right
if I come in your bedroom?

03:30.676 --> 03:32.109
Yeah. Come in.

03:32.178 --> 03:34.146
Why don't you tell me
what happened?

03:34.213 --> 03:37.410
Okay. I was asleep.

03:37.483 --> 03:40.577
But then I woke up
'cause I felt something.

03:41.353 --> 03:43.150
I saw the window was open...

03:45.057 --> 03:49.084
...and he was standing
right where you are.

03:49.161 --> 03:50.321
Right here?

03:50.396 --> 03:51.920
You sure?

03:53.999 --> 03:55.660
All right, so what did he do?

03:55.735 --> 03:58.863
He came toward me.

03:59.071 --> 04:00.368
He came toward you?

04:01.474 --> 04:02.634
Like this?

04:05.611 --> 04:07.442
Then he grabbed me.

04:07.513 --> 04:09.913
- Where?
- Right here.

04:11.417 --> 04:12.509
Like that?

04:13.586 --> 04:15.520
But he was much stronger
than you.

04:17.523 --> 04:19.353
Like that?

04:19.425 --> 04:22.155
He forced himself
on top of me.

04:22.228 --> 04:23.855
Like that?

04:23.929 --> 04:27.865
His breath smelled like he'd been
drinking on the job, like yours.

04:27.933 --> 04:30.697
- Really? What happened next?
- He kissed me.

04:30.770 --> 04:31.930
Where?

04:33.639 --> 04:34.765
Where, baby?

04:39.311 --> 04:41.905
And he stripped me naked.

04:41.981 --> 04:43.972
I was confused.
He ripped my shirt off.

04:51.490 --> 04:53.720
You didn't put up
much of a fight, did you?

04:55.161 --> 05:00.326
Oh, really? I didn't
put up much of a fight?

05:01.600 --> 05:03.124
So you took control?

05:03.202 --> 05:06.831
What did you do next?
What did you do, baby?

05:06.939 --> 05:08.338
Watch me.

05:09.575 --> 05:11.372
Tell me what you did next, baby.

05:17.516 --> 05:21.008
Chief, you've got to get down
to the Scuttlebutt.

05:21.086 --> 05:23.680
We've got a situation here.
It's about to blow.

05:23.756 --> 05:24.916
Chief?

05:26.425 --> 05:29.019
- Yeah, Tony, what's up?
- Where are you, Chief?

05:29.094 --> 05:31.358
Can you get here?
We need you to come quick.

05:33.432 --> 05:36.094
- Chief?
- Okay.

05:38.170 --> 05:39.637
Look, Tony, I'm...

05:41.640 --> 05:42.868
...coming now.

05:42.975 --> 05:44.806
- No.
- I've got to go, baby.

05:44.877 --> 05:47.243
I've got to go.

05:47.313 --> 05:49.042
I've got to go to work.

05:50.649 --> 05:53.743
So we'll pick up
on this crime tomorrow?

05:53.819 --> 05:56.151
- Okay.
- What kind of crime?

05:57.323 --> 06:00.520
- Assault with a deadly weapon.
- Breaking and entering.

06:01.594 --> 06:02.720
See you later, baby.

07:39.591 --> 07:41.684
- How y'all doing?
- Good, Chief.

07:45.431 --> 07:46.523
Morning.

08:00.012 --> 08:03.778
- Mathias Lee Whitlock.
- How you doing, Chris?

08:04.850 --> 08:07.182
Having breakfast
with all your friends here?

08:09.855 --> 08:13.586
I would invite you, Chris,
but I don't want to.

08:14.660 --> 08:18.494
I'd sit down, but I don't want to.

08:18.564 --> 08:22.000
- Did they find us a table?
- Yeah, we're in the back.

08:23.068 --> 08:25.366
- Matt.
- How you doing, Ann?

08:25.471 --> 08:27.837
Okay. I'm starving.

08:27.906 --> 08:30.272
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.

08:30.342 --> 08:33.436
Hey, Chris, try the crab.
It's real good.

08:33.511 --> 08:36.106
- I'm allergic.
- I know.

08:40.419 --> 08:41.408
Right.

09:14.086 --> 09:16.111
- How you doing, Sharlene?
- Hey, Chief.

09:16.188 --> 09:17.951
- What time is it?
- It's 3:00.

09:18.023 --> 09:19.615
3:00. Let's go.

09:20.692 --> 09:23.786
Hey, man, you're
out of paper towels again.

09:23.862 --> 09:26.626
- How you doing, Chae?
- Good.

09:26.698 --> 09:29.132
Thought the camera
only added ten pounds.

09:29.201 --> 09:32.500
- Looks good, doesn't it?
- Kind of, in a pudgy way.

09:34.073 --> 09:35.802
I thought this might be
an opportune time

09:35.908 --> 09:38.342
to revisit my offer
to invest in that business venture.

09:38.410 --> 09:40.605
- Costa Rica?
- Chartered fishing boat.

09:40.679 --> 09:43.671
- Steal the evidence money?
- You file a report on that yet?

09:45.084 --> 09:46.517
- Is that it?
- That's it.

09:46.585 --> 09:50.180
- 485 grand. Can I touch it?
- No, you can't.

09:50.255 --> 09:52.917
- I just want to touch it.
- Get your hands out of there.

09:54.760 --> 09:57.490
- Maybe I'll just steal it.
- Maybe I'll just shoot you.

09:57.563 --> 10:01.192
Stop thinking like a cop.
Just listen to my proposition.

10:02.935 --> 10:05.403
We'll take a grand out.
We'll go to the boat show.

10:05.504 --> 10:08.132
We'll just walk around
with the money in our pocket,

10:08.240 --> 10:12.438
get a sense of what it feels like
to know we could buy a boat.

10:12.511 --> 10:14.445
- I'll see you in a minute.
- What do you think?

10:20.519 --> 10:21.918
- Chae.
- Stranger.

10:21.987 --> 10:24.751
- How you doing?
- How you doing, Alex?

10:24.823 --> 10:26.120
I need your keys.

10:26.191 --> 10:28.591
I'm fine, thanks for asking.
How about you?

10:28.660 --> 10:31.595
Listen, I need your keys.
I left a couple of things.

10:31.663 --> 10:33.893
- Okay. I'll go with you.
- No.

10:35.767 --> 10:38.531
Why not?
I just want to go with you.

10:38.637 --> 10:42.630
I don't want to get into anything.
I got a lot of work to do today.

10:42.741 --> 10:46.142
- I know your work is important.
- Are you going to start with that?

10:46.211 --> 10:49.612
I'm gonna go in the other room
and pretend to make a phone call.

10:49.681 --> 10:52.878
- Congrats on making detective.
- Thanks, Chae.

10:54.653 --> 10:56.484
Forget it.

10:56.555 --> 10:59.991
Even if I left the Hope Diamond
in there, it's just not worth it.

11:01.927 --> 11:04.361
- Bye, Matt.
- Good-bye, Alex.

11:09.434 --> 11:11.698
Would you just give me
the goddamn keys?

11:11.803 --> 11:14.101
They're on the desk
right in front of you.

11:16.141 --> 11:17.608
I'll drop them off.

11:21.013 --> 11:24.107
- See you.
- See you, sweetie.

11:29.321 --> 11:30.618
She looks good.

11:30.689 --> 11:33.317
Sometimes I think you
want me to shoot you.

11:33.392 --> 11:35.257
Wait. Hold that thought.

11:38.664 --> 11:40.154
Medical examiner.

11:41.667 --> 11:46.832
Yeah. All right. What kind of prick
dies at cocktail hour on a Friday?

11:46.939 --> 11:48.930
The nerve of some people.

11:49.041 --> 11:51.703
- Have a good one.
- Yeah, see you.

12:23.809 --> 12:25.276
Catch anything?

12:27.980 --> 12:29.971
Trying to catch my self-respect.

12:30.983 --> 12:34.214
Figuring out what it is I'm doing
in the middle of this...threesome.

12:34.286 --> 12:37.585
Try foursome.
You're forgetting your wife.

12:37.656 --> 12:44.687
She left me. I told her the other day-
told her today-come get her stuff.

12:44.763 --> 12:47.254
How's the pro football quarterback?

12:47.332 --> 12:49.493
He's up north
hunting for the weekend.

12:52.537 --> 12:54.004
The whole weekend.

13:36.815 --> 13:39.807
I got a splinter in my butt. You okay?

13:40.819 --> 13:44.255
I'm okay. I'm definitely okay.

13:44.323 --> 13:45.585
It's all right.

13:48.660 --> 13:50.252
- You still love her.
- Huh?

13:51.330 --> 13:53.093
You still love her, don't you?

13:54.666 --> 13:56.258
Yeah, I do.

13:56.335 --> 13:58.269
Yeah, you do.
Will you divorce her?

13:58.370 --> 14:01.362
- You still got your ring on.
- Chris needs me.

14:01.473 --> 14:03.839
- Oh, okay.
- He does.

14:05.243 --> 14:08.041
He's lost, been that way
since he got cut from the team.

14:10.482 --> 14:11.744
I guess I feel sorry for him.

14:11.817 --> 14:14.650
Remember that the next time
he goes upside your head.

14:34.172 --> 14:36.140
Okay. Sure.

14:40.145 --> 14:41.840
All right. I'll be right there.

15:11.910 --> 15:13.878
- Ann Merai. Hi.
- Dr. Frieland.

15:14.880 --> 15:17.212
- This is my brother Matt.
- Nice to meet you.

15:17.282 --> 15:20.410
Sorry to bring you in today.
I was in surgery all day yesterday.

15:20.485 --> 15:21.645
Please.

15:22.921 --> 15:25.116
You can talk in front of him.
It's fine.

15:35.767 --> 15:41.967
Right. Okay. Ann, I'm afraid
there's been a bit of a setback.

15:43.975 --> 15:45.943
I had your tests back yesterday.

15:50.315 --> 15:54.012
The cancer is not in remission.
It's come back very aggressively.

15:54.085 --> 15:56.315
It's attacked your liver and lungs.

16:07.866 --> 16:09.424
How long?

16:10.368 --> 16:13.531
Well, that's difficult to say.

16:13.638 --> 16:14.696
How long?

16:16.775 --> 16:20.006
Five, six months.
No one can say for sure.

16:29.921 --> 16:31.548
But I feel fine.

16:36.094 --> 16:42.431
Listen...there's a counselor here
at the hospital I'd like you to see.

16:42.501 --> 16:45.698
She's very good.
She'll help you during this period.

16:45.804 --> 16:47.931
Thank you for coming in
on your day off.

16:48.039 --> 16:49.529
Ann, wait.

16:52.978 --> 16:56.641
Excuse me. Maybe you could
speak to her about the counseling?

16:57.983 --> 17:01.714
Listen, you should be able
to do something, right?

17:01.786 --> 17:05.415
What about that experimental stuff?
You know, like "60 Minutes"?

17:06.992 --> 17:11.223
I don't know. There are
alternative approaches.

17:11.296 --> 17:12.455
- Yeah?
- Sure.

17:12.531 --> 17:15.125
Let's see.

17:15.200 --> 17:19.227
Autologous cancer vaccines,
hematology procedures,

17:19.337 --> 17:22.464
hyperthermia treatments.

17:22.574 --> 17:24.541
Here. Take a look at those.

17:24.608 --> 17:28.170
They're extremely expensive,
and there are no guarantees.

17:30.382 --> 17:32.350
- Thanks.
- Okay.

17:38.590 --> 17:40.182
You all right?

17:40.258 --> 17:42.192
Yeah.

17:42.260 --> 17:44.091
Why didn't you tell me, baby?

17:45.096 --> 17:47.428
I'm sorry.

17:48.433 --> 17:50.264
When I was with you...

17:51.770 --> 17:53.203
I forgot about it.

17:53.305 --> 17:55.773
For a couple hours,
I didn't think about dying.

17:57.142 --> 17:58.905
I understand.

18:08.353 --> 18:10.947
You know, they've got
this alternative stuff.

18:11.022 --> 18:13.320
There's a clinic in Switzerland-

18:13.391 --> 18:16.952
I know. With my blood. I don't
put much stock in all that stuff.

18:17.028 --> 18:21.089
They said there's a 17% chance,
a 17% success rate.

18:21.166 --> 18:22.861
A whole 17%?

18:23.735 --> 18:25.635
Odds are better I'd hit the lottery,

18:25.737 --> 18:28.433
which is what I'd have to do
to afford something like that.

18:37.449 --> 18:41.180
Listen. Where are you going?

18:41.252 --> 18:43.379
I don't think we should
do this anymore.

18:44.923 --> 18:47.414
It wasn't right for me
to drag you into this.

18:51.262 --> 18:54.527
You didn't drag me into anything.
I'm a big boy.

18:55.200 --> 18:56.690
Matt, I'm dying.

18:57.769 --> 18:59.100
I'm dying.

19:12.917 --> 19:15.647
- Thanks for the flowers.
- You're welcome.

19:15.720 --> 19:17.950
The girls at work were so jealous.

19:18.023 --> 19:20.787
Glad to hear that.
That's not why you called me.

19:20.859 --> 19:24.522
- What's up?
- I want to show you something.

19:26.197 --> 19:28.961
- Chris didn't hit you again?
- No.

19:30.935 --> 19:35.599
When we were married, we took out
insurance policies on each other,

19:35.707 --> 19:38.141
but they were only
for $100,000.

19:38.209 --> 19:41.508
This says $1 million.
Did you know about this?

19:41.579 --> 19:46.881
No. I remember signing things,
but I didn't know he'd made changes.

19:46.951 --> 19:50.284
He can't get away with this.
This is fraud. You were sick.

19:50.355 --> 19:53.654
No. I was diagnosed
six months ago.

19:53.725 --> 19:56.023
Chris increased the policy
almost a year ago,

19:56.094 --> 19:58.255
right after my 32nd birthday.

20:00.765 --> 20:03.757
My mother was 33
when she died of cancer.

20:07.472 --> 20:08.769
Oh, no.

20:11.443 --> 20:14.469
- That Chris?
- He's here.

20:14.579 --> 20:16.672
- Maybe he can explain this.
- No.

20:16.748 --> 20:19.478
- Why not? Now's the time.
- This is not the time.

20:19.551 --> 20:22.076
- When is the time?
- I don't know.

20:22.153 --> 20:24.018
Please. I'm sorry, baby.

20:33.131 --> 20:35.429
I'm just taking the trash out.

20:36.501 --> 20:38.833
Thought you were working
a double tonight.

20:43.875 --> 20:45.706
Yeah. Bet you did.

20:54.619 --> 20:56.712
How was your appointment
on Saturday?

20:58.223 --> 21:00.691
- Appointment?
- Yeah, with Dr. Frieland.

21:00.759 --> 21:03.455
I didn't have an appointment.

21:03.528 --> 21:06.964
- No? You sure?
- I'm sure.

21:07.031 --> 21:09.932
'Cause Jay saw you
go inside his office.

21:10.001 --> 21:12.026
You were going inside
with some other guy.

21:12.137 --> 21:14.697
No, I just stopped by.
I had to ask some questions.

21:14.806 --> 21:16.034
Now you were there.

21:16.141 --> 21:19.076
I was there, but I had to
ask him some questions.

21:19.144 --> 21:20.907
Here we go with the lies again.

21:20.979 --> 21:22.970
- I'm not lying to you.
- Yes, you are!

21:23.047 --> 21:24.639
Start telling me the truth!

21:25.483 --> 21:28.418
- You're hurting me!
- Why do you make me do this?

21:29.487 --> 21:31.421
I'm not making you do anything!

21:31.489 --> 21:34.981
It ain't my goddamn fault!
It ain't my fault!

21:42.534 --> 21:44.661
Chris, how you doing,
football player?

21:44.736 --> 21:46.465
Good, Mathias.
How you doing?

21:46.571 --> 21:48.368
I'm good.
Judy Anderson called,

21:48.473 --> 21:50.805
said she saw a prowler
in the neighborhood.

21:50.875 --> 21:52.035
You see anything?

21:55.013 --> 21:56.844
What about your wife?
She home?

21:56.915 --> 21:58.678
She didn't see anything.

21:58.750 --> 22:02.516
- You didn't ask her.
- She didn't say anything about it.

22:02.587 --> 22:05.454
Maybe I should ask her, not that
I don't trust your mind-reading.

22:05.523 --> 22:08.720
- Hey, Ann, how you doing?
- I didn't see anything.

22:10.428 --> 22:13.363
- I'm going to check the perimeter.
- Go ahead.

22:13.431 --> 22:15.456
You see somebody,
you holler.

22:18.770 --> 22:20.670
You have a good night.

22:24.075 --> 22:27.067
- We did it.
- This wasn't necessary.

22:27.178 --> 22:31.239
My name shouldn't be on your house.
I'll buy my own in a few years.

22:34.219 --> 22:35.584
All right.

22:40.158 --> 22:43.252
- Chief Whitlock.
- Hey, baby, it's me.

22:43.328 --> 22:47.128
What time do you get off?
I've found a way to go to that clinic.

22:47.198 --> 22:49.257
- Right.
- Can you talk?

22:49.334 --> 22:50.961
- Hold on.
- Forget it.

22:51.035 --> 22:52.332
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

22:52.437 --> 22:55.463
You know, I've got to go.
Tell her I say hi.

22:55.573 --> 22:56.801
Bye.

23:05.750 --> 23:07.513
Is this a bad time? Can you talk?

23:07.585 --> 23:09.018
Yeah. It's no problem.

23:09.087 --> 23:11.783
You've got to hear this.
It's incredible.

23:11.856 --> 23:16.020
I name you the beneficiary
of my life insurance policy.

23:16.094 --> 23:17.857
No, no.
Not me personally.

23:17.929 --> 23:21.160
You name The Living Gift
as your beneficiary

23:21.232 --> 23:23.462
after we purchase
the policy from you.

23:23.534 --> 23:26.435
And you-
I mean, The Living Gift-

23:26.537 --> 23:28.300
collects on the policy
when I die.

23:28.406 --> 23:31.034
As the beneficiary, yes,
we collect on the policy.

23:31.142 --> 23:34.669
So you make a profit if she dies?
Is that legal?

23:34.779 --> 23:38.044
- We wouldn't be here if it wasn't.
- How much do I get?

23:38.116 --> 23:41.745
The amount depends on how long
your medical staff says I have to live.

23:41.819 --> 23:44.049
How about a ballpark figure?

23:44.122 --> 23:46.920
- $750,000.
- I know.

23:47.759 --> 23:50.421
Even if they have to repeat
the treatment several times,

23:50.495 --> 23:53.430
there would be enough money
for us to go somewhere.

23:53.498 --> 23:55.489
Like the Conch Festival
in Key West?

23:57.502 --> 23:58.764
No.

23:58.870 --> 24:00.337
Clambake in Opa Locka?

24:01.139 --> 24:03.505
No! Europe.

24:03.574 --> 24:06.975
- Europe?
- Yeah. Or Africa.

24:20.091 --> 24:21.683
I'm going to beat this.

24:24.762 --> 24:26.252
You watch.

24:28.666 --> 24:30.361
Richard Petty, give me a hand.

24:42.313 --> 24:45.510
Hey, man, watch it.
Don't slip. Watch that blood.

24:57.829 --> 25:00.229
Come on, Ann, talk to me.

25:00.298 --> 25:03.290
Their investors won't let them
buy any new policies.

25:03.368 --> 25:05.165
The Living Gift?

25:06.738 --> 25:10.196
We can go somewhere else.
We'll get somebody else to buy it.

25:10.308 --> 25:12.868
I can't. There's only
two days left to change it.

25:12.977 --> 25:14.171
What do you mean?

25:14.245 --> 25:17.009
A provision says the beneficiary
can't be changed after a year,

25:17.081 --> 25:18.309
and that's in two days.

25:18.383 --> 25:20.283
Well, maybe we could call down...

25:20.351 --> 25:21.818
It's too late!

25:29.427 --> 25:33.329
- Listen...
- Don't, don't. Don't.

25:34.599 --> 25:36.089
This is not fixable.

25:46.644 --> 25:48.339
Just go.

25:49.847 --> 25:51.144
Just go.

26:06.964 --> 26:09.762
What did Alex pick up
from your place the other day?

26:09.834 --> 26:11.267
I don't know.

26:13.371 --> 26:16.829
Well, over for sure now, huh?

26:16.941 --> 26:20.001
She left something so she'd
have a chance to come see you.

26:20.111 --> 26:22.477
See if she still had feelings.

26:22.547 --> 26:27.314
Based on what I saw, she didn't
have any feelings...except anger.

26:27.385 --> 26:28.943
Think you've had enough.

26:29.954 --> 26:31.945
I'm trying to help you here.

26:32.023 --> 26:34.321
One of your patrons
has been overserved.

26:34.392 --> 26:36.189
I may have to cite you
on that, Helena.

26:36.260 --> 26:38.558
See you tomorrow, Chae.

26:38.629 --> 26:40.563
See you tomorrow.

26:42.133 --> 26:45.762
Man. Bustin' my chops,
Mr. Drinking-On-Duty.

26:52.310 --> 26:53.777
I'll see you later.

26:53.845 --> 26:56.075
- Good night.
- Take it easy.

26:58.316 --> 27:00.113
Let me get you a refill, Chief.

27:00.184 --> 27:02.709
No, I'm good, Chris.

27:02.787 --> 27:07.315
It ain't a bribe, just a beer.
Two, whatever he was just drinking.

27:13.364 --> 27:14.456
Thank you.

27:17.535 --> 27:20.026
Let me ask you something.

27:20.138 --> 27:23.107
That night you were out there
looking for that prowler,

27:23.174 --> 27:24.732
did you see anybody?

27:24.842 --> 27:26.742
No, I didn't.

27:26.811 --> 27:34.274
I had this feeling when I got home
that Ann was with some other guy.

27:34.352 --> 27:35.683
Really?

27:35.753 --> 27:38.347
I think he snuck out the back
when I got home.

27:42.760 --> 27:45.558
No, I didn't see anybody.

27:53.671 --> 27:55.195
I'll tell you what, though.

27:55.306 --> 27:58.173
Next time that little pussy
comes around...

27:58.242 --> 27:59.732
Little pussy?

27:59.844 --> 28:03.541
The guy scurries out the back door
the second he hears my voice.

28:03.614 --> 28:05.138
- "Scurries"?
- Yeah.

28:06.584 --> 28:13.615
I could almost respect a man
who had the balls to confront me,

28:13.691 --> 28:17.127
tell me, "Yeah,
I'm banging your wife."

28:19.163 --> 28:21.131
Maybe this guy,

28:21.199 --> 28:25.465
maybe there's nothing
he would rather do than to tell you

28:25.536 --> 28:28.733
that you're a lousy husband
and don't deserve Ann.

28:28.839 --> 28:31.034
Maybe there's nothing
he would rather do

28:31.142 --> 28:33.633
than to walk up to your face,
look you in the eye,

28:33.744 --> 28:40.308
and say to you, "Chris,
I'm banging your wife...good."

28:41.385 --> 28:46.084
Maybe. You know, maybe...
your wife won't let him.

28:48.593 --> 28:50.823
I'd respect him at least.

28:51.762 --> 28:54.697
And if he did that,
then I'd go up to him,

28:54.765 --> 28:56.528
Iook him in his eye, and I'd say,

28:56.601 --> 28:59.035
"Just come near her again...

29:00.471 --> 29:02.462
...and I'll kill you."

29:02.573 --> 29:09.775
Wow. You're talking to the wrong guy,
because as a police officer...

29:09.847 --> 29:12.748
I can't let you go around
threatening people's lives.

29:12.817 --> 29:15.843
If you're serious, I would
be obligated to do something.

29:15.920 --> 29:17.353
Really?

29:17.421 --> 29:18.581
That's right.

29:19.890 --> 29:23.326
Thanks for the beer...
and the conversation.

29:23.394 --> 29:29.162
- Thanks for listening.
- You give Ann my best, if you can.

29:55.926 --> 29:57.188
You been waiting long?

29:58.796 --> 30:01.424
Sorry about last night.

30:05.469 --> 30:07.494
You must really be mad at me.

30:16.314 --> 30:20.307
God, I used to love
coming out here with you.

30:20.384 --> 30:23.751
I thought I was the shit, being
a freshman making out with a senior.

30:23.821 --> 30:25.083
You were.

30:26.157 --> 30:28.682
- Still are.
- I guess I was.

30:37.335 --> 30:39.769
- Here.
- What's this?

30:39.870 --> 30:41.599
My going-away present.

30:41.706 --> 30:44.106
- Going away?
- lnsurance policy.

30:47.945 --> 30:49.913
You're making me the beneficiary?

30:50.014 --> 30:53.973
Buy that fishing boat you and Chae
have always talked about.

30:54.051 --> 30:55.313
Right.

30:56.387 --> 30:59.550
- Here.
- No. I'm leaving tomorrow.

30:59.623 --> 31:00.715
What?

31:00.791 --> 31:03.021
I'm leaving town tomorrow.

31:04.628 --> 31:06.152
I've got to get out of here.

31:06.230 --> 31:09.393
I need to get away from Chris.
I need some peace.

31:36.861 --> 31:39.261
- Chief Whitlock.
- How can I help you?

31:39.330 --> 31:40.991
You just did, buddy.

32:25.476 --> 32:27.239
- How you doing?
- Good.

32:28.813 --> 32:31.043
Take this.
Meet me at my house.

32:31.115 --> 32:33.083
What is it?

32:33.150 --> 32:35.084
It's a gift to you.

32:35.152 --> 32:37.712
- Switzerland.
- What?

32:37.788 --> 32:39.756
- It's money.
- What money?

32:41.959 --> 32:44.120
That drug money?

32:45.196 --> 32:48.825
Matt, no. Oh, my God.

32:49.834 --> 32:51.529
What if they want it back?

32:51.602 --> 32:53.593
By law, the money
has to stay in the custody

32:53.671 --> 32:56.731
of the arresting department
until the appeals process is over.

32:56.841 --> 32:59.105
With the money Scarcetti has,
it could take years.

32:59.176 --> 33:00.541
But Tony and the guys...

33:00.578 --> 33:03.012
They think I'm putting it
in a safe deposit box.

33:03.080 --> 33:04.377
What time does Chris get home?

33:05.916 --> 33:07.577
11:30pm.

33:07.651 --> 33:09.516
Go to your house, pack a bag,

33:09.587 --> 33:12.556
meet me at my house, 11:00.

33:12.623 --> 33:13.851
You okay?

33:15.192 --> 33:17.092
See you later.

33:43.187 --> 33:44.814
What are you doing here?

33:44.889 --> 33:48.518
Barbara's pissed off about something.
Got to wait her out.

33:50.895 --> 33:55.594
Listen. You see anybody
come in here?

33:55.666 --> 33:56.997
- No.
- You sure?

33:58.702 --> 34:01.364
Okay. Why don't you
head over to the Scuttlebutt?

34:01.472 --> 34:03.133
They cut me off,
no thanks to you.

34:03.240 --> 34:05.800
Tell them Chief Whitlock
said everything's okay.

34:05.910 --> 34:07.878
That's the first place
Barbara's going to look!

34:07.978 --> 34:09.467
- She won't look there.
- She will!

34:09.580 --> 34:11.741
I've got half a pack
of cigarettes in there!

36:08.032 --> 36:12.765
Tell Engine Two to lay it out
and start attacking it from the back!

36:12.836 --> 36:13.996
Go, go!

36:17.875 --> 36:19.638
Pull it up! Let's get moving!

36:19.710 --> 36:23.510
1919 on 415 San Juan.

36:23.580 --> 36:26.708
That's about four miles
outside of town.

36:27.751 --> 36:29.844
Go! Let's keep moving!

36:29.920 --> 36:31.512
Aim the hose right there!

36:50.641 --> 36:52.700
Mathias, you all right?

36:54.144 --> 36:55.577
I know it's hard to take.

36:57.147 --> 36:58.910
I'll grab you a cup of coffee.

37:10.194 --> 37:13.288
- Was it an accident?
- I don't know. Maybe.

37:13.363 --> 37:17.629
These propane tanks
just don't blow for no reason.

37:19.036 --> 37:21.800
Man, this place was an inferno.

37:21.905 --> 37:24.373
Those poor folks
didn't have a chance.

37:40.023 --> 37:41.183
Hi, Chief.

37:46.230 --> 37:47.390
Chief.

37:50.534 --> 37:52.001
What are you doing here?

37:52.069 --> 37:55.061
I'm a homicide detective,
and there's two dead bodies.

37:55.973 --> 37:59.238
- So what happened?
- They think the propane tank blew.

37:59.309 --> 38:00.799
You know who they are?

38:00.911 --> 38:03.937
- I think it's definitely "were."
- Right, Chae.

38:04.014 --> 38:06.346
Hey, Mathias, check it out.

38:07.351 --> 38:09.012
Definitely arson.

38:11.221 --> 38:15.089
It's definitely arson. Definitely.

38:15.959 --> 38:18.223
The closer I stay
to the scene, the better.

38:18.295 --> 38:20.456
Yeah, it's possibly
a double homicide.

38:20.531 --> 38:22.965
We're gonna have to
take this thing over.

38:26.570 --> 38:30.336
Chief, Judy Anderson's mom
is visiting from Orlando.

38:30.407 --> 38:33.740
Last night, Judy said her mom
saw somebody sneaking around.

38:33.811 --> 38:35.745
I checked it out,
didn't see anything.

38:35.813 --> 38:37.678
We should probably tell Alex.

38:37.748 --> 38:39.909
I'll tell her.
You get back to the office.

38:39.983 --> 38:44.010
They want me to run my investigation
out of your place for the next 24.

38:44.087 --> 38:47.682
I need your help-background
on the vics, people they knew.

38:47.758 --> 38:49.885
- A tour guide?
- You cool with that?

38:49.960 --> 38:51.518
- Okay. No problem.
- Are you sure?

38:51.595 --> 38:52.789
No problem at all.

38:52.863 --> 38:55.388
Why don't we ride back
and you fill me in on the Harrisons?

38:55.465 --> 38:57.330
My boys will set up at your place.

38:57.401 --> 38:58.561
- Okay.
- Great.

39:09.246 --> 39:13.273
I just wanted to say
I'm really sorry about the timing.

39:13.350 --> 39:14.783
What do you mean?

39:14.852 --> 39:17.844
With the papers,
and then this today.

39:17.921 --> 39:19.183
The divorce papers?

39:19.256 --> 39:22.020
- I should have called you before.
- That would have been nice.

39:23.026 --> 39:24.186
I know.

39:25.162 --> 39:29.428
But it has been eight months.
Don't you think we need closure?

39:29.499 --> 39:31.797
I really don't want
to talk about it.

39:35.906 --> 39:37.635
Thanks for opening up.

39:39.910 --> 39:44.347
Let's talk about the Harrisons.
Either of them screwing around?

39:44.414 --> 39:47.076
I don't know. Is anybody
happily married these days?

39:50.254 --> 39:52.119
These have already
been gone through.

39:52.189 --> 39:54.851
Right. He was supposed
to get off at 11:30.

39:57.094 --> 39:58.686
Right. Mr. Harrison.

40:00.097 --> 40:03.931
So you don't know if Mr. Harrison
came to work or not. Hold on.

40:04.001 --> 40:07.164
Did you know she worked as
a dental hygienist for a Dr. Shider?

40:07.271 --> 40:08.863
Really? No.

40:08.972 --> 40:11.065
I'm going to pay him a visit.
You want to come?

40:14.311 --> 40:16.006
Okay. Thanks.

40:16.079 --> 40:18.070
So she quit yesterday?

40:18.148 --> 40:21.811
Well, kind of. Ann Merai
had terminal cancer.

40:21.885 --> 40:23.750
Really?

40:23.820 --> 40:26.311
I think she was
trying to keep it quiet.

40:26.390 --> 40:32.192
- Anything else you could tell us?
- I think she was having an affair.

40:32.262 --> 40:35.425
Did she actually tell you
she was having an affair?

40:36.433 --> 40:41.894
We don't really talk a lot, mainly
what's happening on our stories.

40:42.005 --> 40:44.473
But I just got the feeling.

40:44.541 --> 40:49.911
Sometimes when she'd be on
the phone, she would talk real quiet.

40:49.980 --> 40:51.140
Whisper?

40:52.950 --> 40:56.886
Did you ever see him,
or did she tell you who he was?

40:59.289 --> 41:02.019
No. But he was classy.

41:02.092 --> 41:06.426
About a week ago,
she got flowers from Rosie's.

41:06.496 --> 41:09.988
Really nice. It was beautiful.
Remember, Bruce?

41:10.067 --> 41:12.365
But I met her husband once,

41:12.436 --> 41:15.997
and he just doesn't seem
like the type to send flowers.

41:16.106 --> 41:17.232
Right.

41:19.309 --> 41:22.574
Rosie! Chief Whitlock.

41:22.646 --> 41:26.082
Listen, we're trying to find out
if some flowers were sent

41:26.149 --> 41:30.813
to an Ann Merai Harrison
last week, sent to her office.

41:30.887 --> 41:34.220
Harrison. Check and see
if one of your guys sent them.

41:34.291 --> 41:36.282
- What hospital?
- Mercy Med.

41:38.895 --> 41:40.988
- Chris Harrison.
- Her husband.

41:41.064 --> 41:42.929
Okay. Thanks a lot, Rosie.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.661
Yeah. No, that's all.

41:44.735 --> 41:46.600
Thank you, Rosie.

41:46.703 --> 41:48.967
If you'd like to make a call...

41:50.540 --> 41:52.167
You ready?

41:53.777 --> 41:55.244
I guess so.

41:55.345 --> 41:57.973
Okay. All right.
Thank you for your help.

41:58.048 --> 41:59.606
- Sure.
- Thank you.

41:59.683 --> 42:04.086
If you think of anything else,
here's my card. Thanks a lot.

42:06.656 --> 42:09.853
Please don't do me like that.
You knew I wasn't finished.

42:09.926 --> 42:11.086
I'm sorry.

42:11.828 --> 42:14.456
Dr. Shider gave me the name
of Ann Merai's doctor.

42:14.531 --> 42:16.658
I want to find out more
about her cancer.

42:18.769 --> 42:21.169
You can drop me off
back at the station.

42:21.271 --> 42:23.739
You really don't like
being around me, do you?

42:23.840 --> 42:25.432
No. I just, you know...

42:25.542 --> 42:29.638
There isn't any reason for both of us
to be wasting time at the doctor's office.

42:29.713 --> 42:31.544
What's so pressing
that you have to do?

42:31.615 --> 42:34.243
I do have a job.
I am Chief of Police.

42:34.317 --> 42:37.115
Yeah, of a four-person
department, Matt.

42:37.187 --> 42:39.485
That's the problem
between the two of us.

42:39.556 --> 42:42.047
You think your job
is more important than my job.

42:42.125 --> 42:44.059
- Never said that.
- Yeah, you did.

42:44.127 --> 42:47.392
You never say it directly,
but in indirect ways you say it.

42:47.464 --> 42:51.423
You wanted to leave Banyan Key so we
could be closer to your important job.

42:51.501 --> 42:54.299
You never said the commute
was taking time away from us?

42:54.404 --> 42:56.497
- I didn't have a problem with that.
- You didn't?

42:56.606 --> 43:00.042
- So I'm hearing things now?
- Whatever.

43:00.110 --> 43:03.273
Is that the reason you're not coming?
Is that your date paging you?

43:03.346 --> 43:06.941
One of my four officers checked in.
It's a tracking device.

43:07.017 --> 43:08.848
And you can tell on that?

43:08.919 --> 43:12.320
That's what it tells me. GPS.
We're all tied into it.

43:12.389 --> 43:15.688
The mayor's brother sells them,
so we spent half the budget on them.

43:15.759 --> 43:19.320
See, if we were moving,
you'd see it tracking.

43:19.396 --> 43:20.886
Sorry.

43:20.964 --> 43:23.865
If we were moving right now,
it would show us tracking.

43:23.934 --> 43:24.992
Great.

43:25.068 --> 43:27.161
Why don't we drive
to the doctor's office,

43:27.270 --> 43:28.999
and I can see how it works?

43:55.432 --> 43:57.798
I'm going to the bathroom.
I'll meet you in there.

43:58.869 --> 44:00.598
- Hi.
- May I help you?

44:00.704 --> 44:02.695
Yeah. Dr. Donovan's office.

44:02.806 --> 44:06.742
- Her office is on the third floor.
- Thank you, Ramona.

44:09.146 --> 44:12.411
Ann Harrison didn't have cancer.

44:12.482 --> 44:14.211
Are you sure?

44:14.284 --> 44:16.184
Not counting the time
she spent in Atlanta,

44:16.253 --> 44:18.847
Ann Merai has been my patient
since junior high.

44:18.922 --> 44:21.220
If she had cancer,
I would have known about it.

44:22.292 --> 44:23.850
I don't get it.

44:24.928 --> 44:27.226
Maybe she saw another doctor.

44:27.297 --> 44:29.197
She was here for her yearly

44:29.266 --> 44:31.757
when she first got
back to town two months ago,

44:31.835 --> 44:34.099
and she was healthy
as a proverbial horse.

44:35.705 --> 44:39.197
I'm looking it over here, and...

44:39.309 --> 44:41.869
I don't understand.
Who told you she had cancer?

44:41.978 --> 44:43.309
Excuse me.

44:47.817 --> 44:49.148
So...

45:21.751 --> 45:23.616
Can I help you?

45:25.188 --> 45:28.180
Yeah, I'm looking for Dr. Frieland.

45:28.258 --> 45:30.453
You're looking at him.

45:31.494 --> 45:33.291
You're Dr. Frieland?

45:33.363 --> 45:36.161
Yes, I am.

45:36.233 --> 45:39.760
- Hold on, Pop.
- You're sure? This is your office?

45:39.869 --> 45:42.133
It has been for ten years, yes.

45:43.139 --> 45:44.663
Look, I'll get back to you.

45:44.774 --> 45:47.743
Do you have a patient named
Ann Merai Harrison?

45:47.811 --> 45:49.779
I really can't tell you that.

45:49.879 --> 45:52.575
You can tell me.
Was she your patient or not?

45:52.749 --> 45:54.683
Was she your patient or not?

45:56.987 --> 45:58.750
Was she your patient or not?

45:59.990 --> 46:02.356
No, I've never had
a patient by that name.

46:02.425 --> 46:04.791
- You sure?
- Yes, I'm sure, very sure.

46:05.362 --> 46:07.353
Yeah, I would know that.

46:07.430 --> 46:08.863
Okay, I'm sorry.

46:12.002 --> 46:14.334
That your pen?

46:14.437 --> 46:17.736
- Pen? Yes.
- Do you use it much?

46:19.075 --> 46:20.508
No, not very much.

46:20.577 --> 46:22.670
You don't mind if I take it, do you?

46:22.746 --> 46:26.910
No, you can have the pen.
Sure. It's yours.

46:28.318 --> 46:30.980
Take it. It's yours.

46:45.435 --> 46:46.663
Right.

46:47.904 --> 46:49.428
Right.

46:49.539 --> 46:51.769
I know that part. Hang on one sec.

46:54.477 --> 46:56.411
Did you get
a checkup or something?

46:56.479 --> 46:58.413
No. Just bad coffee.

46:59.482 --> 47:01.575
All right.

47:01.651 --> 47:04.176
No, just tell them
they've got to stop lagging.

47:04.254 --> 47:06.188
We need
those phone records now.

47:06.256 --> 47:07.951
All right. Thanks.

47:10.360 --> 47:13.090
- You all right?
- Yeah.

47:13.163 --> 47:15.188
We all good? Fantastic.

47:30.914 --> 47:32.347
How's this, ma'am?

47:32.415 --> 47:35.009
You fixed his nose already?
Just wonderful.

47:35.085 --> 47:36.416
Hey, Chief.

47:40.423 --> 47:41.981
How you doing, Judy?

47:42.058 --> 47:44.356
I'm fine, thanks, considering...

47:44.427 --> 47:47.225
Alex, we've got
an eyewitness here.

47:47.297 --> 47:50.892
Mr. Anderson, this is
Detective Diaz-Whitlock.

47:50.967 --> 47:54.334
Well, just...
We're on top of it.

47:54.437 --> 47:56.667
I told them how Judy's mom
saw somebody

47:56.773 --> 47:59.037
sneaking around
the Harrison place last night.

47:59.109 --> 48:01.441
Got them right over there
sketching it out for us.

48:01.511 --> 48:03.376
...the guy she saw
outside her window...

48:03.446 --> 48:04.606
That's her right there?

48:06.216 --> 48:08.707
- Good job.
- Chief, check this out.

48:10.019 --> 48:12.886
Sketch of a prowler out to
the Harrisons' last night. Look.

48:14.491 --> 48:15.651
Ring any bells?

48:15.725 --> 48:17.659
Hi, Tony.

48:18.661 --> 48:21.129
No. I mean, no.

48:22.866 --> 48:24.595
He looked like him.

48:25.702 --> 48:27.795
- Like who?
- Like him.

48:29.239 --> 48:31.833
- Like me?
- Yeah. You.

48:36.946 --> 48:38.811
Mom, he's the Chief of Police.

48:39.849 --> 48:43.012
- So he was black, ma'am?
- Yeah, he was black.

48:43.086 --> 48:46.783
Wait a minute. Maybe him.

48:46.856 --> 48:51.156
Mrs. Anderson, thank you.
Thank you very, very much.

48:52.228 --> 48:53.718
Anyway...

48:53.797 --> 48:55.731
I'm so sorry.

48:55.799 --> 48:57.926
Mother was raised
in a different time.

48:58.001 --> 49:01.095
Don't worry about it.
We're on top of it, okay?

49:01.204 --> 49:03.798
- I need to talk to you.
- I appreciate you coming down.

49:03.907 --> 49:06.467
I am so embarrassed.

49:08.011 --> 49:10.138
Please, you've got to stop.

49:11.214 --> 49:13.842
I want you to take this
up to Miami for me, okay?

49:13.917 --> 49:16.943
I want you to give it
to a Detective Gissen.

49:17.020 --> 49:18.612
- Gissen?
- Gissen, right.

49:18.688 --> 49:22.647
I'm going to give you his number.
I need prints on that ASAP.

49:22.725 --> 49:25.159
- Is it for this thing?
- Yeah.

49:25.228 --> 49:27.719
- Excuse me, Chief.
- Yeah.

49:27.797 --> 49:30.561
An Agent Stark from the DEA
is on line one for you.

49:30.633 --> 49:31.622
Who?

49:31.701 --> 49:34.727
Agent Stark.
Said it's about the Scarcetti case.

49:40.743 --> 49:42.210
Thank you.

49:46.082 --> 49:47.071
Chief Whitlock.

49:47.150 --> 49:49.584
Agent Stark, DEA.
How you doing?

49:49.652 --> 49:52.018
- Busy.
- You and me both, pal.

49:52.088 --> 49:56.286
I understand you guys are holding
evidence in the Scarcetti case.

49:56.359 --> 49:59.351
Great. That makes you
my new best friend.

50:00.430 --> 50:04.093
I'm going to send some agents
this aftemoon to pick up that cash.

50:04.167 --> 50:08.263
We think it was used last year
in a sting operation with Paolo Estaban.

50:08.371 --> 50:11.033
If we can tie the serial numbers
to the bills you guys have,

50:11.140 --> 50:12.937
we can tie Estaban to Scarcetti.

50:13.009 --> 50:15.102
This is a top priority
for us, Chief.

50:15.211 --> 50:17.771
With this evidence, we can
kill two birds with one stone,

50:17.847 --> 50:20.179
nail Estaban and Scarcetti.

50:20.250 --> 50:23.413
Why don't I call you tomorrow,
and we figure out a time-

50:23.486 --> 50:25.920
This had to be done
the day before yesterday.

50:25.989 --> 50:27.581
We've got a court date next week.

50:27.657 --> 50:31.252
The evidence has to stay with me
until the appeals process is over.

50:31.327 --> 50:33.818
I didn't call you to get a lecture
on the rules of evidence.

50:33.897 --> 50:38.527
We need to check the serial numbers,
and that's what we're going to do.

50:38.601 --> 50:40.933
When I hang up on you
in ten seconds,

50:41.037 --> 50:43.767
I want you to type up
a chain of evidence receipt.

50:43.873 --> 50:47.365
One of my men will be happy
to sign it for you this aftemoon.

50:47.477 --> 50:49.911
- Oh, yeah, and, Chief...
- Yeah?

50:49.979 --> 50:51.378
It's been ten seconds.

50:59.222 --> 51:00.849
Chief, you okay?

51:00.924 --> 51:02.516
Yeah. Fine.

51:02.592 --> 51:08.121
Just tell Gissen that I need
those prints really quick.

51:08.197 --> 51:10.165
I'm sure Alex can-

51:10.233 --> 51:12.133
We don't want to give them to Alex.

51:12.201 --> 51:14.795
- Sorry. I just thought-
- Just do it!

51:16.573 --> 51:19.406
All right. Okay.

51:19.475 --> 51:21.909
I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.

51:21.978 --> 51:25.971
Just go there, stay there,
and call me as soon as they're done.

51:26.049 --> 51:27.311
You got it.

51:37.694 --> 51:40.162
No, I've been on hold.
When should I call back?

51:41.831 --> 51:43.264
Okay. Thanks.

51:47.203 --> 51:48.602
Here you go.

51:54.210 --> 51:55.768
Baste, my phone records!

51:55.878 --> 51:58.346
How long can it take to fax over
a few sheets of paper?

51:58.448 --> 52:00.313
I'll call them again.

52:00.383 --> 52:05.150
- Alex, I think we got something here.
- What?

52:05.221 --> 52:07.917
Look at this entry
into the checkbook, that last one.

52:10.093 --> 52:13.028
- Is this the only entry you found?
- So far, but it's a new register.

52:13.096 --> 52:15.030
What's going on?

52:15.098 --> 52:19.194
They got a life insurance policy,
and we've got a potential murder.

52:19.268 --> 52:23.728
Shit, there's got to be tons of these
life insurance companies, right?

52:23.806 --> 52:24.864
Right.

52:24.974 --> 52:27.238
- You got any pull at the bank?
- Sure.

52:27.310 --> 52:30.245
- You want me to get an address?
- Please.

52:32.649 --> 52:35.413
Sharlene, you know
that report I gave you?

52:51.367 --> 52:55.167
They're not going to be able
to run them for another half an hour.

52:55.271 --> 52:57.205
Call me when you've got something.

52:57.273 --> 53:00.140
- T.
- Shit.

53:00.209 --> 53:01.904
You should see the rack

53:01.978 --> 53:04.344
on this chick
that just walked by.

53:04.414 --> 53:06.405
- Just call me.
- Oh, my God.

53:16.059 --> 53:19.028
- Those my phone records?
- No, just a fax for me.

53:19.095 --> 53:21.928
Baste, what's up with my fax?
It's not here.

53:21.998 --> 53:24.228
- She said she sent them.
- Who's she?

53:24.300 --> 53:26.097
- Miss White.
- Who's Miss White?

53:26.169 --> 53:29.263
She's a supervisor over there.
I've dealt with her before.

53:29.372 --> 53:30.999
Call Miss White back.
They're not here.

53:31.107 --> 53:33.541
I talked to her
a couple of minutes ago.

53:33.609 --> 53:34.633
Detective...

53:34.744 --> 53:37.975
Well, she assured me
that she sent them.

53:38.047 --> 53:39.810
We need to call her back

53:39.882 --> 53:43.181
and actually have her wait
as we see the fax coming through.

53:44.053 --> 53:46.487
Sure, boss. Be happy to.

53:54.397 --> 53:56.297
Miss White?

53:56.365 --> 53:58.230
This is Detective Baste
with Miami-Dade.

53:58.301 --> 54:01.737
Yeah, I just spoke to you
about the Harrison phone records.

54:01.838 --> 54:03.806
I haven't received them yet.

54:03.906 --> 54:06.204
What do you mean
you sent them?

54:06.275 --> 54:09.005
I'm staring at the fax machine,
and it's not there.

54:09.078 --> 54:11.273
I'm going to stand right in front of it.

54:11.347 --> 54:13.338
If I don't hear the phone ring
in 30 seconds,

54:13.416 --> 54:15.680
I'm going to your superiors.

54:15.752 --> 54:17.879
Do I need to be more clear than that?

54:17.954 --> 54:19.683
Can I use your computer for a sec?

54:19.756 --> 54:20.950
Couple of minutes.

54:21.023 --> 54:23.617
He just e-mailed me a bunch
of warrants I need to look up.

54:23.693 --> 54:26.560
- 60 seconds.
- I'm not raising my voice!

54:39.976 --> 54:42.410
You got writer's block.

54:42.478 --> 54:44.810
No, just working on my report.

54:44.881 --> 54:47.441
On what?
On somebody jaywalking?

54:47.517 --> 54:50.418
Yeah, someone was jaywalking,
or urinating on the sidewalk,

54:50.486 --> 54:52.750
or throwing spitballs
at a crossing guard.

54:52.822 --> 54:54.619
It's a small office, but it's my office.

54:54.690 --> 54:56.555
Phone records coming in.

55:01.731 --> 55:03.323
- Is this it?
- It says "receiving."

55:09.605 --> 55:11.163
Oh, shit. It's out of paper.

55:11.274 --> 55:15.540
You're kidding me. Oh, God.
Could we get some paper, Sharlene?

55:15.611 --> 55:18.375
Anybody got any paper? Paper, folks!

55:18.447 --> 55:22.611
Don't all move at once.
Anybody in Banyan Key have paper?

55:22.685 --> 55:24.585
It's about 81/2 by 11 inches...

55:24.654 --> 55:26.417
Here you go.

55:45.141 --> 55:47.200
What do you do? "Start"?

55:49.312 --> 55:51.143
Here it comes.

55:53.216 --> 55:56.310
We've got a little problem
with this machine.

55:57.320 --> 55:59.584
It's fine, fine.

55:59.655 --> 56:01.179
Great. Thank you.

56:01.257 --> 56:03.020
Let me just get over here.

56:05.928 --> 56:07.293
I hate this thing.

56:09.665 --> 56:10.859
Here.

56:11.868 --> 56:14.234
There we go. "Start."

56:14.337 --> 56:16.362
There we go.

56:20.843 --> 56:23.141
- I can't read this.
- It's the toner.

56:23.212 --> 56:25.772
- Have her re-fax it.
- It's okay.

56:25.848 --> 56:28.749
- I can read it. It's okay.
- No, fax it again.

56:28.818 --> 56:30.843
That says Barry Thomas.

56:30.920 --> 56:33.514
A friend of Chris' from high school.
I know him.

56:33.589 --> 56:36.820
- That one is Will Blount.
- You guys okay?

56:36.893 --> 56:38.087
It's okay.

56:38.160 --> 56:41.254
This one is Frank Rhodes.

56:41.564 --> 56:44.328
No. All the boxes go to Miami.

56:44.400 --> 56:48.496
So the last call they made was
to American Airlines at 8 p.m.

56:48.571 --> 56:50.971
Hey. Got a surprise for you.

56:51.040 --> 56:54.032
Both of them already dead when
somebody turned them into s'mores.

56:54.110 --> 56:55.839
- What?
- Both of them?

56:55.945 --> 56:58.004
No sign of smoke in their lungs.

56:58.114 --> 57:00.514
If they'd been alive
when that place went up,

57:00.549 --> 57:02.312
their lungs would look like mine.

57:03.719 --> 57:05.983
Alex, here are
the cell phone records.

57:06.055 --> 57:07.044
Cell phone?

57:07.123 --> 57:09.887
They're on a different database
than the land lines.

57:09.959 --> 57:11.824
"Town of Banyan Key."

57:12.795 --> 57:15.263
"12:34 a.m."

57:15.331 --> 57:18.528
305-555-0199?

57:20.903 --> 57:23.701
What time did grandma say
she saw that prowler?

57:23.773 --> 57:24.899
After "Leno."

57:25.007 --> 57:28.135
What time's "Leno" over?
Like 12:00, 12:30?

57:28.244 --> 57:29.211
Hello?

57:29.312 --> 57:31.337
This might be our guy.

57:31.447 --> 57:33.506
How many phone calls
do you get after midnight?

57:33.616 --> 57:35.208
Must be a bad connection.

57:35.284 --> 57:39.118
All right. 555-0199.

57:41.123 --> 57:42.590
Come on, come on.

57:54.203 --> 57:57.900
Yeah. Okay. Let me see
if I can find the number for you.

58:00.943 --> 58:02.103
I don't know who it is.

58:03.346 --> 58:05.644
The Nextel subscriber
you are trying to reach

58:05.715 --> 58:08.377
is outside the service area.
Please try again later.

58:09.218 --> 58:11.550
No, I don't have it.

58:11.620 --> 58:14.088
Whoever it is works
for the town of Banyan Key.

58:14.156 --> 58:16.317
How do we find out
whose phone this is?

58:16.392 --> 58:19.259
- All right, I'll...
- Just ask.

58:19.328 --> 58:21.296
Is there anybody
even in Banyan Key?

58:22.365 --> 58:23.889
Yeah, I'll talk to you later.

58:27.737 --> 58:29.432
Hey, Alex?

58:29.505 --> 58:33.566
I'm sorry, I was drifting off there.
What'd you say that number was?

58:33.676 --> 58:35.610
555-0199.

58:35.678 --> 58:38.169
0199?

58:38.280 --> 58:40.180
You're sure it's not 1099?

58:40.249 --> 58:42.183
Chae, 0199.

58:42.251 --> 58:46.017
0199? That's weird.
That's my cell phone number.

58:46.088 --> 58:47.783
Yours?

58:47.857 --> 58:49.825
- Yeah.
- Aren't you County?

58:49.892 --> 58:53.453
I work part-time as a paramedic-
football games, school stuff.

58:53.529 --> 58:55.520
And you called him last night?

58:55.598 --> 58:57.566
I don't know.
Did l...?

58:58.901 --> 59:01.165
Oh, Jesus,
I did call him last night.

59:02.471 --> 59:04.098
I called him from the bar.

59:04.173 --> 59:07.165
I wanted to see if he wanted
to have a couple of drinks.

59:07.243 --> 59:10.178
- You're friends with him?
- I wouldn't say that.

59:10.246 --> 59:13.147
He's, like,
my bottom-of-the-list guy

59:13.215 --> 59:15.706
when you've got to have
somebody to drink with.

59:15.818 --> 59:18.514
I would have mentioned it.
I totally forgot.

59:18.587 --> 59:21.181
You should have told me this
at the scene, Chae.

59:21.257 --> 59:24.522
I'm sorry. I don't remember
too much about last night.

59:24.593 --> 59:27.221
I had a fight with Barbara.
I was in no good shape.

59:27.296 --> 59:29.491
Check with the bartender-
I closed the place,

59:29.565 --> 59:31.590
staggered home,
passed out next to my wife.

59:31.667 --> 59:34.363
I didn't move until I got the call
to show up at the scene.

59:36.405 --> 59:38.339
I need a statement.

59:38.441 --> 59:40.500
I'll give you a statement
right now.

59:41.710 --> 59:43.439
What's the matter with you?

59:43.546 --> 59:46.447
You're like a love child
of Barney Fife and Joe Friday.

59:47.183 --> 59:48.411
All right, a statement.

01:00:01.897 --> 01:00:04.559
- What was that about?
- I was sleeping with her.

01:00:05.634 --> 01:00:06.828
Jesus.

01:00:06.902 --> 01:00:08.529
So you didn't...

01:00:08.604 --> 01:00:11.664
No, but it was all a plan,
them coming back here.

01:00:11.774 --> 01:00:13.708
They set me up,
planned the whole thing.

01:00:13.776 --> 01:00:15.744
What plan?
What do you mean?

01:00:16.846 --> 01:00:19.314
I gave her the Scarcetti money.

01:00:19.381 --> 01:00:21.008
God!

01:00:21.083 --> 01:00:24.450
Would you have given it to me
if I slept with you?

01:00:28.791 --> 01:00:31.419
- Any trace of the money?
- None.

01:00:32.461 --> 01:00:34.452
I thought I had trouble
with women.

01:00:34.530 --> 01:00:36.157
Maybe you should just tell her.

01:00:36.232 --> 01:00:37.893
- Who, Alex?
- Yeah. Tell Alex.

01:00:37.967 --> 01:00:41.164
Are you out of your mind?
Look what they've got on me.

01:00:41.237 --> 01:00:44.331
Motive-Ann Merai names me
beneficiary on her insurance policy,

01:00:44.406 --> 01:00:45.998
and I was having an affair with her.

01:00:46.108 --> 01:00:48.076
Opportunity-
an eyewitness saw me

01:00:48.144 --> 01:00:50.408
outside their house
the night it blew up.

01:00:50.479 --> 01:00:52.470
You want to hear some more?

01:00:52.581 --> 01:00:53.548
Alibi.

01:00:53.649 --> 01:00:55.207
Home, by myself.

01:00:55.284 --> 01:00:58.151
That good? At least you
changed your cell phone number.

01:00:58.220 --> 01:01:00.381
Even if Alex
wanted to believe me,

01:01:00.456 --> 01:01:03.186
there's so much evidence
against me, she'd have to turn me in.

01:01:03.259 --> 01:01:04.988
You're right.

01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:07.358
That'd kill any chance
of getting back together.

01:01:07.429 --> 01:01:08.589
What?

01:01:08.664 --> 01:01:11.132
She says,
"Let's call the divorce off."

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:15.159
What are you talking about?
I'm looking at murder charges.

01:01:15.237 --> 01:01:17.865
The gal's a peach. I don't know
what you were thinking.

01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:19.407
Never mind. Forget it.

01:01:20.743 --> 01:01:21.971
Can I do anything?

01:01:22.077 --> 01:01:24.341
You don't think
obstruction of justice is enough?

01:01:24.413 --> 01:01:26.313
I'm on a roll.

01:01:27.216 --> 01:01:28.581
Chief Whitlock.

01:01:28.651 --> 01:01:30.209
They matched the prints
on the pen.

01:01:30.286 --> 01:01:33.380
The guy's name is Paul Cabot.
He's done time before.

01:01:33.455 --> 01:01:35.548
They got his prints
from a criminal database.

01:01:35.624 --> 01:01:37.182
You got an address?

01:01:37.259 --> 01:01:41.218
Yeah. 36 Reef Road, in Kendall.

01:02:09.391 --> 01:02:10.653
All right, come on.

01:02:12.328 --> 01:02:13.727
Hurry up.

01:02:26.609 --> 01:02:29.339
- You want a beer?
- Nah, I'm okay.

01:03:05.814 --> 01:03:07.782
What tangled webs we weave...

01:03:07.850 --> 01:03:09.112
What you got?

01:03:09.184 --> 01:03:12.984
Your doctor worked at the hospital,
but seems he was in my line of work.

01:03:13.055 --> 01:03:14.579
Son of a gun.

01:03:14.657 --> 01:03:16.284
Let's get out of here.

01:03:16.358 --> 01:03:18.656
- Let me get the beer.
- Come on, let's go.

01:03:18.727 --> 01:03:20.217
I've got to get the beer.

01:03:20.296 --> 01:03:23.732
A beer in the hand
is worth two in the fridge.

01:03:36.111 --> 01:03:37.135
What are you doing?

01:03:37.246 --> 01:03:41.046
Bottom of the ninth.
Down by a lot of runs.

01:03:41.116 --> 01:03:44.017
I got about ten grand in the bank.

01:03:44.086 --> 01:03:46.987
Get you down to Costa Rica.
You can scout out boats for us.

01:03:48.057 --> 01:03:49.649
You think I'm done?

01:03:51.093 --> 01:03:53.493
I appreciate the offer,
but I'm not running.

01:03:53.562 --> 01:03:55.496
No. The idea was I drive you.

01:03:55.564 --> 01:03:59.500
Yeah, you can drive me.
Drive me back to the station.

01:04:01.170 --> 01:04:02.728
- All right.
- All right.

01:04:14.016 --> 01:04:16.143
Got your insurance company
on the line.

01:04:16.218 --> 01:04:18.118
That policy number
corresponds to

01:04:18.187 --> 01:04:20.655
a $1 million
term life insurance policy

01:04:20.723 --> 01:04:22.315
for an Ann Merai Harrison.

01:04:22.391 --> 01:04:23.983
Any messages there for me?

01:04:25.060 --> 01:04:28.325
- Who's the beneficiary?
- Just a moment here.

01:04:33.402 --> 01:04:38.169
Let's see. Looks like
the beneficiary is listed as...

01:04:42.845 --> 01:04:44.836
... Chris Harrison, her husband.

01:04:49.084 --> 01:04:51.314
Thank you.
You've been really helpful.

01:04:51.387 --> 01:04:54.322
I'm sorry I couldn't be more-
Wait a minute.

01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:56.324
Wait a minute. I got a note here.

01:04:56.392 --> 01:05:02.456
The policy holder requested a form
to change the beneficiary last week.

01:05:02.531 --> 01:05:04.499
So she changed it?

01:05:04.566 --> 01:05:07.228
If she did, it hasn't made it
in the system yet.

01:05:07.302 --> 01:05:09.964
So what does that mean?
Is that in the mail, or...

01:05:10.038 --> 01:05:12.268
It could be downstairs
in our processing center.

01:05:12.341 --> 01:05:14.901
Waiting to be processed.
Can you connect me?

01:05:15.010 --> 01:05:16.978
I think they're still out to lunch.

01:05:17.045 --> 01:05:19.707
All right, so call back
in half an hour?

01:05:19.782 --> 01:05:21.113
Sure, why not?

01:05:21.183 --> 01:05:22.377
Thank you.

01:05:27.523 --> 01:05:28.820
This is Bill.

01:05:29.892 --> 01:05:32.952
- How you doing?
- Good. What have you been up to?

01:05:34.229 --> 01:05:37.164
You've got no idea.
Let me ask you a favor.

01:05:37.232 --> 01:05:42.932
I've got a Capital One credit card
statement on a Paul Cabot.

01:05:43.005 --> 01:05:45.439
I need you to find out
the last place he used his card.

01:05:45.541 --> 01:05:47.270
I got something for you.

01:05:47.376 --> 01:05:48.638
- C-A-B-O-T?
- Yeah.

01:05:48.744 --> 01:05:51.144
- Can you hold?
- Yeah. No problem.

01:05:51.213 --> 01:05:53.613
I found this under the seat
of one of the Harrison's cars.

01:05:53.682 --> 01:05:57.914
It's a bank card receipt to a gas station
used by a guy named Paul Cabot.

01:05:57.986 --> 01:06:00.318
Nice. Check the phone records.

01:06:00.389 --> 01:06:02.186
- Already on it.
- Paul Cabot.

01:06:02.257 --> 01:06:05.454
Anybody know or ever heard
of a Paul Cabot?

01:06:05.527 --> 01:06:08.223
Come on, people, wake up.

01:06:08.297 --> 01:06:10.390
Yes? No?

01:06:10.466 --> 01:06:11.558
No.

01:06:11.633 --> 01:06:12.930
Paul Cabot?

01:06:13.001 --> 01:06:15.401
Frank, call the bank,
see what they've got.

01:06:15.471 --> 01:06:18.770
No records of any incoming
or outgoing calls to a Paul Cabot.

01:06:18.841 --> 01:06:22.277
Check every restaurant,
gas station...

01:06:22.344 --> 01:06:24.244
- Yeah?
- I've got something.

01:06:24.313 --> 01:06:27.510
If this guy took a piss
and paid for it, I want to know.

01:06:27.583 --> 01:06:30.814
He's got a reservation
at the Costa Coral Hotel.

01:06:30.886 --> 01:06:33.855
- There's a hold on it now?
- Checked in yesterday.

01:06:33.922 --> 01:06:35.981
- Costa Coral Hotel.
- You know where it is?

01:06:36.058 --> 01:06:37.992
- Yeah. On Atlantic Avenue.
- Yeah.

01:06:38.060 --> 01:06:40.324
You're a lifesaver.

01:06:51.039 --> 01:06:52.563
- Chief Whitlock?
- Yeah.

01:06:52.674 --> 01:06:54.403
Agent White.
This is Agent Fetzer.

01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:56.603
We're here to pick up
the Scarcetti money.

01:06:56.712 --> 01:07:00.648
Agent Stark said to send
the money to his office.

01:07:00.749 --> 01:07:02.512
My guy left five minutes ago.

01:07:02.584 --> 01:07:05.849
- He told you we'd pick it up.
- He said send it to his office.

01:07:05.921 --> 01:07:07.980
He told you to send
the money to the office?

01:07:08.056 --> 01:07:09.250
He'll tell you.

01:07:09.324 --> 01:07:11.315
- Let me talk to him.
- He wants to talk to you.

01:07:13.862 --> 01:07:17.457
What the hell is your problem?
I told you to get that money ready,

01:07:17.533 --> 01:07:19.433
- that I was sending agents-
- You said-

01:07:19.501 --> 01:07:21.696
What are you, a parrot,
telling me what I said?

01:07:21.770 --> 01:07:23.101
I know what I said.

01:07:23.171 --> 01:07:25.969
No, I'm not a parrot.
I know what you said.

01:07:26.074 --> 01:07:27.871
Then where the hell is the money?

01:07:27.976 --> 01:07:32.208
If you shut up for five minutes,
I can tell you where the money is.

01:07:33.415 --> 01:07:35.849
I sent the money to your office.
My guy just left.

01:07:35.918 --> 01:07:37.943
He should be up there
in about an hour.

01:07:38.020 --> 01:07:41.046
If you have a problem with that
after I hang up in ten seconds,

01:07:41.123 --> 01:07:43.648
call your partners at the lRS,
tell them to audit me.

01:07:43.725 --> 01:07:46.956
- You little bastard!
- Agent Stark.

01:07:47.029 --> 01:07:48.326
What? What?

01:07:48.397 --> 01:07:50.729
- I meant five seconds.
- Damn it, Chief!

01:07:50.799 --> 01:07:53.359
Sorry, I can't hear you.
You're breaking up.

01:07:53.435 --> 01:07:56.302
Can you hear me?

01:07:56.371 --> 01:07:58.202
Sorry about your phone.

01:07:58.273 --> 01:07:59.763
Can you hear me now?

01:08:05.213 --> 01:08:07.681
Costa Coral Hotel.
Good aftemoon.

01:08:07.749 --> 01:08:11.708
I just checked in to your hotel.
I'm trying to access my voice mail.

01:08:11.787 --> 01:08:13.846
- You're not in your room.
- I'm on my cell phone.

01:08:13.922 --> 01:08:15.389
Okay, that's no problem.

01:08:15.457 --> 01:08:18.358
- Can you help me?
- Sure. What's your room number?

01:08:18.426 --> 01:08:20.759
I don't remember. I just checked in.

01:08:20.828 --> 01:08:22.524
- What's your name?
- Paul Cabot.

01:08:22.598 --> 01:08:23.587
Please hold.

01:08:24.933 --> 01:08:28.232
- You're in room 715.
- 715. Okay, thank you.

01:08:28.303 --> 01:08:29.827
To access your voice mail...

01:08:29.904 --> 01:08:33.102
Alex, we got a Paul Cabot
at a Costa Coral Hotel in Miami.

01:08:33.207 --> 01:08:34.698
It's on Atlantic.

01:09:05.073 --> 01:09:08.167
- He's supposed to be here already.
- These people work slow.

01:09:08.276 --> 01:09:10.368
- Did you get those things?
- Yeah. You got a TV?

01:09:10.479 --> 01:09:11.810
Watch pay-per-view.

01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:15.316
Forget pay-per-view.
You got your wife under control?

01:09:15.417 --> 01:09:17.317
Is she cool? She's not gonna...

01:09:17.386 --> 01:09:20.446
She's not talking to nobody.
She's not going nowhere.

01:09:20.522 --> 01:09:22.581
She's got too much to lose.

01:09:22.658 --> 01:09:24.057
All right.

01:09:24.126 --> 01:09:26.787
Damn, man.
You take a terrible picture.

01:09:26.862 --> 01:09:29.261
Get yourself over here.
We've gotta get out of town.

01:09:29.331 --> 01:09:30.524
Right.

01:09:31.533 --> 01:09:33.296
Excuse me.
How you doing?

01:09:33.368 --> 01:09:38.600
I left my key up in my room.
A knucklehead. 715. It's Cabot.

01:09:38.674 --> 01:09:40.733
Paul Cabot, 715.

01:09:40.841 --> 01:09:42.776
Happens all the time, Mr. Cabot.

01:09:42.844 --> 01:09:44.470
Thank you.

01:10:15.977 --> 01:10:17.137
Paul?

01:10:21.483 --> 01:10:23.246
Paul Cabot, it's the police.

01:12:45.026 --> 01:12:48.757
403, request
for driver's license info...

01:12:59.941 --> 01:13:01.340
- There's somebody up there!
- What?

01:13:01.443 --> 01:13:05.209
There's somebody up there!
Oh, my God!

01:13:10.986 --> 01:13:12.510
Where?

01:14:27.729 --> 01:14:29.219
See you, Mr. Cabot.

01:14:46.982 --> 01:14:49.212
Do you have a Paul Cabot
registered here?

01:14:49.284 --> 01:14:50.444
Yeah.

01:14:50.518 --> 01:14:52.918
Someone was pushed off
the seventh-floor balcony!

01:14:52.988 --> 01:14:54.580
How do you know he was pushed?

01:14:54.656 --> 01:14:57.352
A man was seen climbing
back into his room.

01:14:57.425 --> 01:15:00.758
- Calm down, relax.
- Which side of the building was it?

01:15:00.829 --> 01:15:03.662
That's the guy!
That's him! That's Cabot!

01:15:29.324 --> 01:15:31.189
I'll take four. You go upstairs.

01:16:00.722 --> 01:16:02.986
- Stop!
- Jesus!

01:16:03.058 --> 01:16:04.491
Mathias?

01:16:05.427 --> 01:16:06.689
I pulled in right after you.

01:16:06.761 --> 01:16:08.854
- Did he come down?
- Nobody came past me.

01:16:08.930 --> 01:16:11.797
- I'll meet you in the lobby.
- In the lobby.

01:16:24.813 --> 01:16:28.340
Get these people out of here.
I'm gonna shut down the elevators.

01:16:31.486 --> 01:16:33.113
It's him!

01:16:45.733 --> 01:16:49.863
Police officer. Upstairs!
I'll cover the back!

01:16:57.445 --> 01:17:00.437
- You got the money?
- Yeah, I got the money.

01:17:00.515 --> 01:17:03.075
- Where'd you stash it?
- Right behind the seat.

01:17:03.785 --> 01:17:06.015
Flight number 601,
non-stop to San Jose.

01:17:06.087 --> 01:17:09.215
I'm not flying to Costa Rica.
Get off the phone.

01:17:09.290 --> 01:17:12.657
- I gotta go.
- I'll swing by your house...

01:17:16.564 --> 01:17:19.397
- Your new girl?
- No.

01:17:20.168 --> 01:17:22.602
Weren't we supposed
to meet in the lobby?

01:17:22.670 --> 01:17:26.731
I just had to get my cell
out of the car, make a call...

01:17:27.809 --> 01:17:31.245
...to the office, you know,
checking on a lead.

01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:34.446
- Let's go back upstairs.
- My boys are on it.

01:17:37.118 --> 01:17:39.678
Why don't we go have a talk?

01:17:40.822 --> 01:17:41.982
Sure.

01:17:55.470 --> 01:18:00.874
You got something you want
to tell me or need to tell me?

01:18:00.975 --> 01:18:02.442
What do you mean?

01:18:03.611 --> 01:18:09.208
Something that I ought to know,
but that you might not want to say.

01:18:12.287 --> 01:18:14.551
Congratulations
on making detective.

01:18:15.223 --> 01:18:17.851
I'm proud of you.
I never said it, but I am.

01:18:17.926 --> 01:18:20.861
I know you are.
You don't have to say it.

01:18:21.896 --> 01:18:23.921
That's not what I'm talking about.

01:18:25.934 --> 01:18:28.129
How'd you get to the hotel so fast?

01:18:29.270 --> 01:18:30.999
I heard it on the radio.

01:18:33.942 --> 01:18:36.342
So, nothing else you want to say?

01:18:36.411 --> 01:18:39.437
I'm gonna sign those divorce papers.

01:18:39.547 --> 01:18:43.540
- I'm not talking-
- I'll get to it. I just haven't...

01:18:43.651 --> 01:18:45.983
- Believe me, I'll sign 'em.
- It's cool.

01:18:46.054 --> 01:18:47.919
We're in no hurry.

01:18:48.756 --> 01:18:50.314
Are we?

01:18:50.391 --> 01:18:52.120
I'm not.

01:18:54.262 --> 01:18:56.355
You know what this place
reminds me of?

01:18:57.232 --> 01:18:59.666
When we first started going out.

01:18:59.734 --> 01:19:03.101
Remember when we used to talk
on the phone for hours?

01:19:03.171 --> 01:19:06.004
And you had this thing.

01:19:06.107 --> 01:19:10.635
You'd say, "Well,
I guess that's everything."

01:19:10.745 --> 01:19:14.511
And you'd hang up on me.
And then you'd call right back.

01:19:15.116 --> 01:19:16.743
That's right.

01:19:16.818 --> 01:19:18.911
What would you say?

01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:21.010
That I love you...

01:19:22.590 --> 01:19:24.057
...very much.

01:19:28.563 --> 01:19:30.224
I liked that.

01:19:49.517 --> 01:19:50.643
Come here.

01:19:50.718 --> 01:19:53.152
Come here, you have
something in your hair.

01:20:55.650 --> 01:20:57.447
Chief...

01:20:57.518 --> 01:21:00.817
These are from Agent Stark.
He sounded kind of pissed.

01:21:00.888 --> 01:21:02.446
See you tomorrow, okay?

01:21:02.523 --> 01:21:04.616
Detective, the hotel called.

01:21:04.692 --> 01:21:07.252
The clerk's on his way
from the hospital.

01:21:07.328 --> 01:21:08.556
Detective?

01:21:08.629 --> 01:21:12.326
Call the insurance company, see if they
found out who the beneficiary is yet.

01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:14.459
You got it.

01:21:33.721 --> 01:21:35.882
- City Hall.
- Hi. Accounting, please.

01:21:35.957 --> 01:21:38.187
Sure, let me get
that number for you.

01:21:38.259 --> 01:21:41.353
I'm sorry, they've gone
home for the day.

01:21:41.429 --> 01:21:44.125
- Of course they have. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:21:44.966 --> 01:21:48.766
Alex, did Cabot make any
phone calls from his hotel?

01:21:48.836 --> 01:21:50.428
We're waiting on them.

01:21:50.505 --> 01:21:52.063
Okay.

01:21:53.474 --> 01:21:56.102
Chief, the hotel called.
They left a message.

01:21:57.345 --> 01:22:00.610
The clerk left half an hour ago.
He should be here any minute.

01:22:03.451 --> 01:22:04.816
Great.

01:22:19.901 --> 01:22:21.425
Whitlock.

01:22:24.939 --> 01:22:26.634
- Hello?
- Matt...

01:22:28.376 --> 01:22:31.641
Matt, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

01:22:31.712 --> 01:22:33.737
I'm so sorry.

01:22:33.848 --> 01:22:36.408
It was never...

01:22:36.484 --> 01:22:38.145
This is a surprise.

01:22:38.219 --> 01:22:43.156
There's so much
I have to tell you.

01:22:43.224 --> 01:22:45.488
I need to...

01:22:45.993 --> 01:22:48.518
You got a lot of people
worried about you, Ann.

01:22:48.596 --> 01:22:49.722
I know.

01:22:49.797 --> 01:22:51.856
We all had the funny idea
that you were dead.

01:22:53.568 --> 01:22:56.332
I'm sorry, Matt.
I'm so sorry.

01:22:56.404 --> 01:22:58.964
- I'm so sorry.
- Where's Chris?

01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:02.032
Oh, God, I've lied to you
so much.

01:23:02.143 --> 01:23:03.735
He forced me to do this.

01:23:03.845 --> 01:23:08.145
He and his friend Paul found out
about the Scarcetti thing.

01:23:08.216 --> 01:23:10.184
They stole bodies from the morgue.

01:23:10.251 --> 01:23:13.516
- You switched the dental records.
- I had to.

01:23:13.588 --> 01:23:17.718
I had to.
They said they'd kill me.

01:23:18.426 --> 01:23:20.326
See, Paul was a criminal, Matt.

01:23:20.394 --> 01:23:23.022
- He was?
- Yes.

01:23:23.097 --> 01:23:25.088
He was killed today.

01:23:26.334 --> 01:23:28.598
They made me do this.

01:23:29.871 --> 01:23:32.806
Now it looks like
you and I faked my death

01:23:32.874 --> 01:23:35.342
to collect on the insurance policy.

01:23:38.412 --> 01:23:40.676
So what do you want me to do?

01:23:40.748 --> 01:23:42.682
I don't want to
have to face them

01:23:42.750 --> 01:23:45.184
and have to answer
questions about this.

01:23:45.253 --> 01:23:48.552
I gotta get out of town,
but I don't know where to go.

01:23:48.623 --> 01:23:51.490
And I need money.

01:23:52.226 --> 01:23:54.057
So where's Chris?

01:23:55.930 --> 01:23:59.366
You're right.
I should have come to you earlier.

01:23:59.433 --> 01:24:00.832
He's there, isn't he?

01:24:00.902 --> 01:24:02.392
Yes.

01:24:05.606 --> 01:24:07.767
I would have contacted you earlier,

01:24:07.875 --> 01:24:10.002
but I knew you would think
it was another trick.

01:24:10.111 --> 01:24:13.239
I don't blame you.
He beat me up and...

01:24:15.349 --> 01:24:17.715
- Matt?
- Yeah.

01:24:19.220 --> 01:24:21.711
He beat me up and...

01:24:22.456 --> 01:24:25.653
- See, Paul had the money-
- I have the money.

01:24:27.428 --> 01:24:31.592
No, I don't want to involve you
in any more of this.

01:24:31.666 --> 01:24:33.190
Where are you?

01:24:33.267 --> 01:24:36.327
I'm here at the old boat.

01:24:36.404 --> 01:24:37.894
Stay there. I'll meet you.

01:24:46.881 --> 01:24:50.908
I've interviewed her twice already,
and it does match up.

01:25:14.609 --> 01:25:17.908
- Neil, Detective Diaz-Whitlock.
- Hi.

01:25:17.979 --> 01:25:20.413
- Ouch. How you feeling?
- I'm okay.

01:25:20.481 --> 01:25:22.745
You're up for answering
a few questions? Yeah?

01:25:22.817 --> 01:25:25.377
You need anything else?
This way.

01:25:31.525 --> 01:25:34.392
All right, take a seat to your left.

01:25:34.996 --> 01:25:36.588
Here you go.

01:25:36.664 --> 01:25:39.895
- Where's Chief Whitlock?
- I don't know. Bathroom, maybe.

01:25:39.967 --> 01:25:42.993
Alex, insurance company, line two.

01:25:43.070 --> 01:25:44.435
Detective Diaz-Whitlock.

01:25:44.505 --> 01:25:48.271
Detective, I got your beneficiary.
It's a Mathias Lee Whitlock.

01:25:49.577 --> 01:25:51.044
Thank you.

01:26:25.446 --> 01:26:29.143
Agent Stark, DEA.
I'm looking for Chief Whitlock.

01:26:42.096 --> 01:26:44.758
- How much was it?
- 485,000.

01:26:45.866 --> 01:26:48.027
Did he arrange to have it
picked up or dropped off?

01:26:48.102 --> 01:26:51.594
He told my agents he was sending it
to my office. Nobody showed.

01:26:51.672 --> 01:26:53.367
I'm sure it was
just miscommunication.

01:30:24.118 --> 01:30:26.143
That's a.38, Chris.

01:30:27.821 --> 01:30:29.618
Only six shots.

01:30:50.945 --> 01:30:53.413
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun!

01:31:21.775 --> 01:31:23.504
He's gone.

01:31:29.216 --> 01:31:30.683
You all right?

01:31:33.420 --> 01:31:35.081
Give me the gun.

01:31:35.155 --> 01:31:36.679
Wait a minute.

01:31:38.225 --> 01:31:41.592
You said he beat you up.
It was self-defense.

01:31:41.662 --> 01:31:44.688
No jury would convict you.
Just put the gun down.

01:31:44.765 --> 01:31:47.359
You think Chris
did this to my face?

01:31:51.638 --> 01:31:54.937
I think you should
put your gun on the floor.

01:31:56.076 --> 01:31:57.668
What?

01:31:57.778 --> 01:32:02.215
Put it down. I didn't think
I could do this, but I will.

01:32:07.221 --> 01:32:09.155
You set this up.

01:32:09.223 --> 01:32:12.056
- Put your gun on the floor.
- Are you sure?

01:32:20.067 --> 01:32:21.864
Don't do this.

01:32:23.437 --> 01:32:24.904
Where's the money?

01:32:24.972 --> 01:32:27.031
Come on. Jesus!

01:32:49.163 --> 01:32:50.687
So you...

01:32:51.832 --> 01:32:54.562
We didn't mean anything
to each other?

01:32:55.335 --> 01:32:57.496
- It's not important.
- That's not important now.

01:32:57.571 --> 01:33:00.506
- It was just all an act?
- Where's the money?

01:33:00.541 --> 01:33:04.068
Look me in the eye and tell me
you didn't mean any of it.

01:33:04.178 --> 01:33:06.738
Some of it!
Don't try to confuse me!

01:33:06.847 --> 01:33:10.078
- I don't have any choice now.
- You don't have to do this.

01:33:10.150 --> 01:33:12.482
I've known you all your life.
You're not a criminal.

01:33:12.553 --> 01:33:15.215
- You know I know you-
- Stop!

01:33:25.132 --> 01:33:26.565
What?!

01:33:27.668 --> 01:33:31.035
Okay. All right,
high-school sweetheart.

01:33:31.105 --> 01:33:33.903
You think I'm playing?
I'm not playing.

01:33:35.109 --> 01:33:36.406
Damn!

01:33:36.510 --> 01:33:39.775
- I was aiming for your arm.
- Well, you missed!

01:33:39.847 --> 01:33:41.576
- Where is it?
- Outside the door.

01:33:41.648 --> 01:33:44.242
- Show me!
- All right.

01:33:44.318 --> 01:33:47.412
Just calm down. Just wait a minute.

01:33:47.488 --> 01:33:51.948
Just wait. Don't shoot me.
I'm just gonna reach for it.

01:33:52.025 --> 01:33:53.356
Show me!

01:33:54.828 --> 01:33:56.887
- Here it is.
- Put it down.

01:33:58.098 --> 01:34:00.726
- Wait, don't shoot me.
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:34:00.801 --> 01:34:04.396
I'm the one that got you the money.
I'm trying to save your life.

01:34:09.676 --> 01:34:14.272
It wasn't all an act. I can't live broke.
Life ain't shit when you're broke.

01:34:15.983 --> 01:34:17.917
- Shit!
- Wait!

01:34:17.985 --> 01:34:20.180
Wait, no!

01:34:31.398 --> 01:34:32.865
Oh, my God.

01:34:35.903 --> 01:34:39.134
- Anyone else up here?
- No.

01:34:50.450 --> 01:34:51.917
How'd you find me?

01:35:00.827 --> 01:35:03.625
- Are you hit?
- No, I'm okay.

01:35:03.697 --> 01:35:05.187
I'm all right.

01:35:11.338 --> 01:35:14.899
It's Alex. Get me an ambulance
and a med examiner.

01:35:15.008 --> 01:35:19.377
No, I'm fine. I'm at the end
of Runyon Road on the dock.

01:35:19.446 --> 01:35:20.777
Hurry.

01:35:24.451 --> 01:35:25.941
Did you kill Paul Cabot?

01:35:28.121 --> 01:35:29.349
No...

01:35:29.423 --> 01:35:32.449
It was self-defense.
He was attacking me.

01:35:32.526 --> 01:35:34.357
I was trying
to get the money back.

01:35:34.428 --> 01:35:37.363
You were just gonna
hand the money back?

01:35:38.398 --> 01:35:43.358
- That's what I was trying to do.
- Then what's that over there?

01:36:29.182 --> 01:36:30.376
What do you got?

01:36:30.450 --> 01:36:33.010
Chris and Ann Harrison's
bodies are upstairs.

01:36:33.086 --> 01:36:34.417
The real ones.

01:36:35.555 --> 01:36:37.455
They were both working for Cabot.

01:36:37.524 --> 01:36:41.255
Chief found out they were here
and took care of business, right?

01:36:42.829 --> 01:36:43.955
Right.

01:36:44.031 --> 01:36:46.499
- Let's move.
- Good job.

01:36:46.566 --> 01:36:48.261
Thank you.

01:36:52.306 --> 01:36:53.898
Thank you very much.

01:36:56.310 --> 01:36:58.540
Your guy never
showed up, Whitlock.

01:36:59.579 --> 01:37:01.479
Agent Stark?

01:37:01.548 --> 01:37:02.708
Yeah.

01:37:03.850 --> 01:37:05.909
I don't care
if you're injured or not.

01:37:05.986 --> 01:37:10.423
I want that evidence money, or you're
gonna be looking at a case-

01:37:10.490 --> 01:37:13.948
Where the hell is Southeast
63rd Street in Miami?

01:37:14.027 --> 01:37:17.986
53rd Street. I told you
53rd Street, not 63rd.

01:37:18.065 --> 01:37:19.430
- No, you did not.
- Yes, I did.

01:37:19.499 --> 01:37:21.228
I said Southeast 53rd-

01:37:21.301 --> 01:37:23.201
You said,
"Those assholes in the DEA

01:37:23.270 --> 01:37:26.068
are at 8400
Southeast 63rd Street."

01:37:26.139 --> 01:37:27.800
I didn't. I'm very sorry.

01:37:27.908 --> 01:37:30.342
What I said was,
"Those assholes from the DEA

01:37:30.410 --> 01:37:34.278
are at 8400 Southeast 53rd."

01:37:34.348 --> 01:37:36.441
- 63rd.
- Never mind.

01:37:36.516 --> 01:37:38.916
Just give them the money.
Give them the money.

01:37:40.520 --> 01:37:44.251
You don't have to count it.
It's all there. Have a safe ride home.

01:37:47.627 --> 01:37:49.561
- Come on.
- Assholes.

01:37:51.932 --> 01:37:54.992
- It is all there, right?
- Most of it.

01:37:55.068 --> 01:37:57.366
It's all there.

01:37:58.572 --> 01:38:01.234
That's a pretty good one.
Nice touch.

01:38:01.341 --> 01:38:02.638
A little over the top.

01:38:02.743 --> 01:38:04.005
- Which part?
- Your part.

01:38:04.111 --> 01:38:06.671
You're the one
that came in here screaming.

01:38:06.780 --> 01:38:08.179
What happened to you, man?

01:38:08.248 --> 01:38:11.217
Just never leave your wife.
That's what happened to me.

01:38:12.619 --> 01:38:13.984
I'd take the bullet.

01:38:14.988 --> 01:38:19.687
Be careful there. It's a classic.
That grille work comes from France.

01:38:21.228 --> 01:38:24.288
- How you feeling? Excuse us.
- Yes, ma'am.

01:38:25.432 --> 01:38:26.922
Did you love her?

01:38:29.102 --> 01:38:30.399
No.

01:38:31.905 --> 01:38:34.203
Why would you do this, then?

01:38:35.942 --> 01:38:37.239
Because I'm...

01:38:39.312 --> 01:38:42.475
Because I'm stupid.
Because...

01:38:42.549 --> 01:38:47.043
I thought I was doing the right thing,
trying to help her, but it's no excuse.

01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:53.218
Sometimes people,
you know, do stupid things.

01:38:55.262 --> 01:38:58.288
Especially when they're still in love.

01:39:08.308 --> 01:39:09.775
Thank you.

01:39:09.843 --> 01:39:10.969
Let's go.

01:40:07.367 --> 01:40:09.358
How you doing?
I thought you were Chae.

01:40:09.436 --> 01:40:11.301
He called all worked up
about something.

01:40:12.606 --> 01:40:14.096
Okay.

01:40:14.174 --> 01:40:17.109
- You want to sit down?
- Yeah.

01:40:27.387 --> 01:40:29.378
- How you doing?
- Good.

01:40:29.456 --> 01:40:31.822
- I asked that already?
- Yes. I said I was good.

01:40:31.892 --> 01:40:34.383
- You want a beer?
- Yes.

01:40:35.829 --> 01:40:39.697
I don't have any left.
You can share mine, though.

01:40:41.835 --> 01:40:44.167
So what brings you out this way?

01:40:44.237 --> 01:40:47.001
I just needed to move
the rest of my stuff.

01:40:48.942 --> 01:40:51.206
That's cool, I guess.

01:40:52.779 --> 01:40:54.303
The house is a mess.

01:40:55.549 --> 01:40:58.245
This came for you at the station.

01:40:59.886 --> 01:41:02.548
You opened it?
You opened my mail?

01:41:02.622 --> 01:41:05.147
- Why you always opening my mail?
- Just read it.

01:41:05.725 --> 01:41:07.625
They just want you
to fill out the forms.

01:41:07.694 --> 01:41:09.559
"To claim amount payable
to the beneficiary

01:41:09.629 --> 01:41:12.029
for the sum of $1 million."

01:41:12.832 --> 01:41:16.393
- What?
- We're rich.

01:41:16.469 --> 01:41:18.903
We're rich.
How about that?

01:41:18.972 --> 01:41:21.270
- $1 million.
- Easy, Chae.

01:41:21.374 --> 01:41:24.866
- He can't take that money.
- I can't take the money?

01:41:24.978 --> 01:41:28.175
- Why not?
- It's a conflict of interest.

01:41:28.248 --> 01:41:31.649
- He's the legal beneficiary.
- I am the legal beneficiary.

01:41:31.718 --> 01:41:33.913
And he's one of
the arresting officers.

01:41:33.987 --> 01:41:36.615
What the hell's that
got to do with anything?

01:41:36.690 --> 01:41:39.784
Tell him how much trouble
you can get in.

01:41:39.859 --> 01:41:43.886
It's a million bucks!
It's the chance of a lifetime! No!

01:41:45.198 --> 01:41:48.429
As his wife, I'm telling you
he's not taking that money.

01:41:49.536 --> 01:41:51.902
- As my wife?
- As your wife.

01:41:53.106 --> 01:41:54.596
Come on.

01:41:55.275 --> 01:41:57.334
Come on, don't fall for that.

01:41:57.444 --> 01:42:00.470
- What do you mean, as my wife?
- As your wife.

01:42:00.547 --> 01:42:03.482
You said you came
to move your stuff.

01:42:03.583 --> 01:42:05.813
I'm moving back in.

01:42:05.885 --> 01:42:08.718
This is great. Congratulations.
It's kind of fortuitous.

01:42:08.788 --> 01:42:10.619
- You serious?
- Yeah.

01:42:10.690 --> 01:42:12.453
Are you gonna behave?

01:42:12.525 --> 01:42:15.289
I'm actually afraid
to leave you by yourself.

01:42:15.362 --> 01:42:17.796
You won the sweepstakes, man.

01:42:18.798 --> 01:42:21.562
You can do this later.
It's a million bucks.

01:42:21.635 --> 01:42:23.432
Let's not lose focus.

01:42:23.503 --> 01:42:27.564
You know, a honeymoon fund,
a nursery wing for the...

01:42:28.475 --> 01:42:32.844
This is the golden pot
at the end of the storm thing!

01:42:34.547 --> 01:42:37.141
Just sign it before you go in, huh?

01:42:38.718 --> 01:42:40.345
I'm not gonna let you
do this to yourself.

01:42:40.420 --> 01:42:42.980
I'm gonna be sitting out here
when you're finished.

01:42:43.056 --> 01:42:46.082
I can wait three minutes.
I'm a patient man.

01:42:46.159 --> 01:42:48.093
I am a patient man.

01:42:48.161 --> 01:42:49.992
Come on!
