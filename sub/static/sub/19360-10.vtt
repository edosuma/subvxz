00:22.701 --> 00:25.034
Anderson: Just
rows and rows of white tents,

00:25.069 --> 00:28.037
full of families
who are fleeing violence.

00:28.072 --> 00:30.873
This is a war which is barely
getting a mention anymore.

00:40.951 --> 00:42.217
Yeung:
Go! Go! Go!

00:45.289 --> 00:46.888
Refugee:
We are not animals!

00:58.067 --> 01:01.769
America's invasion
of Afghanistan in 2001

01:01.805 --> 01:03.471
<i>was supposed
to prevent the country</i>

01:03.506 --> 01:06.607
<i>from becoming
a safe haven for terrorists.</i>

01:06.643 --> 01:10.311
<i>However, after 15 years,
nearly a trillion dollars,</i>

01:10.347 --> 01:12.479
<i>and thousands of
American lives lost,</i>

01:12.514 --> 01:14.180
<i>the Taliban now control</i>

01:14.216 --> 01:16.115
<i>or contest more territory</i>

01:16.151 --> 01:18.318
<i>than they have since
the invasion,</i>

01:18.354 --> 01:20.920
<i>and civilian casualties
are piling up.</i>

01:20.956 --> 01:24.624
<i>Now, Ben Anderson has been covering
the war there for 10 years,</i>

01:24.660 --> 01:26.893
<i>and he recently traveled
back to Afghanistan</i>

01:26.928 --> 01:30.863
to check the status of America's
longest-running war.

01:47.247 --> 01:50.181
They're saying, there are
six IEDs laid on the road.

01:50.216 --> 01:52.917
One of the Humvees
got hit by a mine

01:52.952 --> 01:55.219
about 300, 400 meters
back there,

01:55.255 --> 01:57.054
so they're walking
along this ditch.

01:57.090 --> 01:58.890
They're saying there are
also mines here,

01:58.925 --> 02:00.324
so we've got to watch
where we step.

02:00.360 --> 02:03.460
Try and stay...

02:20.978 --> 02:22.412
Here?

02:22.447 --> 02:24.480
Anderson: You can tell because
the ground is disturbed?

02:39.262 --> 02:41.630
Jesus.

02:59.381 --> 03:00.681
Anderson: <i>These policeman
are trying to reach</i>

03:00.716 --> 03:03.551
<i>an army base that's surrounded
by the Taliban.</i>

03:03.586 --> 03:07.521
<i>They want to retrieve the body of a
soldier killed four days earlier,</i>

03:07.557 --> 03:09.256
<i>so they can give him
a proper burial.</i>

03:09.291 --> 03:12.191
<i>It was too
dangerous to continue,</i>

03:12.226 --> 03:13.960
<i>so they head back to the base.</i>

03:13.995 --> 03:16.362
<i>Even though they knew
the Taliban placed</i>

03:16.397 --> 03:18.765
<i>at least six IEDs
on this stretch of road,</i>

03:18.800 --> 03:22.201
<i>the police decided to drive
slowly towards the army base...</i>

03:29.810 --> 03:32.377
Anderson: <i>Dismantling
each IED as they went.</i>

03:42.022 --> 03:45.957
Anderson: So he's trying to
either detonate or expose a mine,

03:45.992 --> 03:47.658
using nothing
but a very long stick...

03:54.433 --> 03:58.435
This is the independent,
able, fully-equipped,

03:58.471 --> 04:01.305
Afghan security force
we've left behind.

04:09.915 --> 04:11.581
Anderson: <i>As they
discuss how to proceed,</i>

04:11.617 --> 04:14.083
<i>bullets hit the Humvee
we were walking alongside.</i>

04:24.028 --> 04:25.360
Man:
Yes, sir.

04:26.697 --> 04:28.330
Anderson:
<i>We inched along the road</i>

04:28.365 --> 04:30.265
<i>while one man,
crawling on his belly,</i>

04:30.300 --> 04:33.736
<i>dug up the IEDs
with his bare hands.</i>

05:00.763 --> 05:02.195
Anderson:
Jesus.

05:04.767 --> 05:07.668
Anderson: <i> He pulls the jug full of
explosives to the side of the road</i>

05:07.703 --> 05:10.770
<i>and separates it from the pressure
plate designed to detonate it.</i>

05:12.840 --> 05:14.807
So, this is
a pressure plate IED.

05:14.842 --> 05:17.409
Two pieces of wood
put together like that...

05:18.713 --> 05:21.647
the metal...
not quite touching

05:21.683 --> 05:24.416
but almost touching.

05:24.452 --> 05:26.151
Plastic to make it waterproof,

05:26.187 --> 05:28.887
and when something goes on top

05:28.922 --> 05:30.488
and push the two together,

05:30.523 --> 05:31.823
the two bits of metal connect,

05:31.858 --> 05:33.424
it completes the circuit.

05:33.460 --> 05:35.060
There's a power source
on one end

05:35.095 --> 05:36.995
and a detonating charge
on the other, which is attached

05:37.030 --> 05:39.263
to the yellow jug
full of explosives,

05:39.299 --> 05:41.600
and that's what sets it off.

05:49.942 --> 05:53.443
The pressure plates, they need to put a lot
of weight on top of them to set them off,

05:53.479 --> 05:54.645
but still...

06:02.487 --> 06:03.987
Mahmoud: Yeah.

06:19.603 --> 06:22.004
Anderson: <i>It was then I realized
I had met this man before,</i>

06:22.039 --> 06:23.739
<i>almost two years ago.</i>

06:23.774 --> 06:24.873
Shoot me in the...

06:24.908 --> 06:27.643
Anderson: <i> Even then, he seemed
lucky to still be live.</i>

06:28.746 --> 06:30.245
Oh! This is very close
to your heart.

06:33.450 --> 06:35.116
This was shrapnel?

06:35.151 --> 06:37.251
You're lucky to be alive.

06:44.193 --> 06:45.960
Yeah.

06:45.995 --> 06:48.996
- Hopefully there'll be no seventh time.
- Hopefully. Yeah.

06:56.271 --> 06:58.271
Anderson: <i>After
dismantling all six IEDs,</i>

06:58.306 --> 07:00.206
<i>they finally reached the base.</i>

07:00.241 --> 07:02.809
<i>Outside were the remains
of a rickshaw</i>

07:02.844 --> 07:05.478
<i>that had just been
blown up by another IED.</i>

07:31.270 --> 07:33.971
You're too brave. You'll get...
You'll get killed.

07:34.007 --> 07:35.472
You have to be careful.

07:37.510 --> 07:38.642
You...

07:39.679 --> 07:40.745
Ev...

07:46.885 --> 07:48.451
Anderson: <i>He told me what
happened to his wife</i>

07:48.486 --> 07:50.553
<i>just three weeks
before he arrived.</i>

08:29.926 --> 08:33.427
Anderson: So, this
is an Afghan army unit...

08:33.462 --> 08:36.363
who have been surrounded by the
Taliban and cut off for four days.

08:36.398 --> 08:39.032
This is the first support they've
had in four days.

08:39.068 --> 08:42.803
But they lost one of their guys, and
apparently they're gonna remove him now.

09:22.676 --> 09:24.042
Ehh...

10:13.357 --> 10:16.224
Anderson: <i>That same morning,
just 15 kilometers away,</i>

10:16.259 --> 10:17.959
<i>the Taliban drove a Humvee laden</i>

10:17.994 --> 10:20.094
<i>with explosives
into a police base...</i>

10:22.131 --> 10:26.433
<i>killing the local police chief
and at least 14 others.</i>

10:26.469 --> 10:28.369
<i>Later that night,
the police withdrew</i>

10:28.404 --> 10:30.771
<i>to one of the main HQ's
in Lashkar Gah.</i>

10:30.806 --> 10:32.506
<i>The news was not good.</i>

11:07.073 --> 11:08.639
Anderson: So, the
attack we saw today was

11:08.674 --> 11:10.174
from the north of the city,

11:10.210 --> 11:13.878
there was an attack later
in the day from the west,

11:13.914 --> 11:16.547
and then he's listening
to the Taliban on their radio

11:16.582 --> 11:21.152
who have just launched an attack from
the Kandahar gate, east of the city.

11:22.122 --> 11:24.788
So, in the space
of less than 12 hours,

11:24.823 --> 11:27.791
three major attacks
from three different directions

11:27.826 --> 11:29.893
around Lashkar Gah.

11:31.563 --> 11:34.264
Anderson: <i>The next night, we saw
the remaining security forces</i>

11:34.300 --> 11:35.832
<i>abandon the area.</i>

11:55.219 --> 11:57.953
This road is where
we were yesterday.

11:57.988 --> 12:01.923
And it did have ANA, Afghan
army vehicles all along here,

12:01.959 --> 12:04.059
but they, for some reason,
have pulled back.

12:04.094 --> 12:07.395
It looks like they're
abandoning the entire area.

12:10.700 --> 12:12.667
So, can you explain what...
what just happened?

12:25.081 --> 12:28.849
You're smiling slightly, but
this must be very frustrating.

12:40.261 --> 12:43.196
Anderson: <i>With Afghan forces unable
to stop the Taliban advance,</i>

12:43.231 --> 12:46.866
<i>civilians often have to take
up arms to defend their homes.</i>

12:46.901 --> 12:48.667
<i>On my last trip to Helmand,</i>

12:48.703 --> 12:51.903
<i>I filmed with a family who
had formed a local militia.</i>

12:51.938 --> 12:54.473
<i>Every member...
including three boys</i>

12:54.508 --> 12:57.842
<i>age 10, 12, and 14...
had to fight.</i>

12:57.878 --> 13:00.345
How much support are
you getting from the Americans

13:00.381 --> 13:01.846
or from the Afghan
government now?

13:09.722 --> 13:11.489
Were you fighting
as well when they attacked?

13:16.362 --> 13:18.762
Do you find it hard to be
brave when there's fighting?

13:20.233 --> 13:23.199
Anderson: <i>Since then, their home
district had largely fallen</i>

13:23.235 --> 13:25.968
<i>and they'd been forced to flee
to the provincial capital.</i>

13:26.004 --> 13:28.571
So, we were hoping to spend
some time with Ajani,

13:28.606 --> 13:32.275
<i>the commander who we spent time
filming with last time we were here,</i>

13:32.310 --> 13:33.843
but she's gone missing.

13:33.878 --> 13:36.946
She went to Marjah for a day,

13:36.981 --> 13:40.282
hasn't been heard of
for three or four days.

13:40.317 --> 13:42.751
They think she made it
to a police base somewhere...

13:43.987 --> 13:46.055
and is stuck there,
trying to get back.

13:46.090 --> 13:49.324
But her husband,
who we're following now,

13:49.360 --> 13:52.494
was terrified that she'd
been captured or killed.

13:55.232 --> 13:59.233
So, that's three of the family
members they've lost so far.

14:00.336 --> 14:04.138
Those two are his son,
and that's his nephew.

14:04.174 --> 14:07.775
That's Zahair, who last time we had
lunch on the roof with him and Ajani.

14:27.662 --> 14:30.097
How much of Marjah do
the Taliban now control?

14:36.304 --> 14:38.070
And how are
your three grandsons?

14:38.106 --> 14:40.439
The boys we spent
time with last time?

14:52.119 --> 14:54.986
Anderson: <i>Then, his grandchildren
returned home from school.</i>

14:58.658 --> 15:00.658
How are you?
Good to see you again.

15:13.405 --> 15:15.005
So, how are you?
Tell me how you are.

15:21.113 --> 15:23.979
Anderson: Yeah, you look good with
a school bag instead of a AK.

15:36.227 --> 15:39.927
Your grandfather said you still
have to provide security at night.

15:45.068 --> 15:46.501
And can you describe
what happened,

15:46.537 --> 15:49.070
that meant you had to leave
your home and come here.

16:38.385 --> 16:41.753
Anderson: <i> Do you think there'll be a
time when you can just go to school</i>

16:41.788 --> 16:44.656
and not... not have to do
security like this?

16:51.931 --> 16:54.064
Anderson: <i> Helmand
took more US resources</i>

16:54.100 --> 16:56.066
<i>and was the scene
of more US casualties</i>

16:56.102 --> 16:57.901
<i>than anywhere else
in Afghanistan.</i>

16:59.071 --> 17:01.505
<i>Today, apart from
a few district centers,</i>

17:01.541 --> 17:04.241
<i>most of it is back
in the hands of the Taliban.</i>

17:05.143 --> 17:07.410
<i>Lashkar Gah,
the provincial capital,</i>

17:07.445 --> 17:10.813
<i>is the only major town
the government still controls.</i>

17:10.848 --> 17:12.582
<i>But the Taliban
are also making gains</i>

17:12.617 --> 17:14.351
<i>elsewhere in the country,</i>

17:14.386 --> 17:16.319
<i>even in places
where, historically,</i>

17:16.355 --> 17:18.788
<i>they haven't had
a strong foothold.</i>

17:23.093 --> 17:25.827
<i>In Kunduz, I met up
with Major Hamid Saifi,</i>

17:25.863 --> 17:28.396
<i>an Afghan soldier I'd spent
lots of time with before.</i>

17:40.176 --> 17:41.942
Anderson: <i>He'd managed to
hold on to his district</i>

17:41.978 --> 17:45.880
<i>in Helmand for nine years,
but it soon fell after he left.</i>

17:45.915 --> 17:48.182
<i>He is now stationed in Kunduz,</i>

17:48.217 --> 17:50.050
where the fighting is constant.

18:10.339 --> 18:13.872
So, the current Taliban operation
to try and take Kunduz City

18:13.908 --> 18:15.708
is being led from right here?

18:30.056 --> 18:32.857
They're just
knocking holes in people's walls,

18:32.892 --> 18:35.259
using the houses as bases.

18:37.263 --> 18:39.897
<i>The fighting here is
often house-to-house.</i>

18:50.209 --> 18:51.608
They shoot from this close?
Yeah. Yeah.

18:51.644 --> 18:54.645
It's very close.
50, 60 meters.

18:54.680 --> 18:56.380
Saifi:
Yeah. Yeah.

19:00.018 --> 19:02.853
This building here
with the black around the door?

19:10.395 --> 19:12.729
How often do they come
to these positions and attack?

19:27.911 --> 19:30.846
I saw you fighting
very hard in Helmand.

19:30.881 --> 19:34.015
Billions of dollars are spent,
an effort was made

19:34.050 --> 19:36.618
training Afghan security forces,

19:36.653 --> 19:41.154
but today, almost all of the
province is in the Taliban's hands.

19:41.190 --> 19:42.523
Why do you think that happened?

19:59.708 --> 20:01.875
After you were sent
from Helmand,

20:01.910 --> 20:03.743
do you know what
happened to your unit?

20:42.882 --> 20:44.482
Anderson: <i>At a meeting
with local elders,</i>

20:44.517 --> 20:48.585
<i>Major Saifi heard stories and sentiments
he had heard often in Helmand.</i>

21:37.533 --> 21:39.633
Anderson: <i>While
we were there,</i>

21:39.668 --> 21:42.302
<i>the Taliban took the provincial
capital of Kunduz province</i>

21:42.337 --> 21:44.638
<i>for the second time
in 13 months.</i>

21:46.909 --> 21:48.876
<i>These recent gains
are unprecedented</i>

21:48.911 --> 21:51.111
<i>and the Taliban now
control more territory</i>

21:51.146 --> 21:54.614
<i>than they have at any point
since being overthrown.</i>

21:54.649 --> 21:56.115
<i>This increased violence
has caused</i>

21:56.150 --> 21:58.718
<i>hundreds of thousands
of people to flee their homes.</i>

22:09.363 --> 22:13.698
So, this is a camp
for internally displaced people,

22:13.734 --> 22:17.035
people who've had to flee from
Kunduz, the neighboring province

22:17.070 --> 22:18.770
because of the fighting there.

22:32.818 --> 22:34.552
Anderson: <i>When the government
was unable to help</i>

22:34.587 --> 22:35.653
<i>the provincial governor,</i>

22:35.688 --> 22:38.288
<i>Dr. Zia contacted
wealthy friends,</i>

22:38.323 --> 22:40.691
<i>and within a week, they'd
provided food, shelter,</i>

22:40.726 --> 22:43.060
<i>and medical care for the
people who fled here.</i>

22:51.469 --> 22:54.938
Anderson: <i>In just four days,
75,000 people had come</i>

22:54.973 --> 22:56.839
<i>and were now living
on the side of the road,</i>

22:56.875 --> 22:59.742
<i>miles away
from the nearest town.</i>

23:10.688 --> 23:13.956
Anderson: In some ways, this feels
like the scene of our decade...

23:13.991 --> 23:16.257
you know, just rows
and rows of white tents

23:16.293 --> 23:18.026
full of families
who are fleeing violence.

23:18.062 --> 23:20.928
But this isn't Syria,
Jordan, or Greece.

23:20.964 --> 23:24.364
This is a war which is barely
getting a mention anymore,

23:24.400 --> 23:28.869
even though
it's getting rapidly worse.

23:32.108 --> 23:33.574
Anderson:
<i>Afghanistan returned</i>

23:33.610 --> 23:35.109
<i>to the headlines in early April</i>

23:35.144 --> 23:38.111
<i>when the US dropped
a 22,000-pound bomb...</i>

23:38.146 --> 23:39.545
<i>its largest non-nuclear bomb...</i>

23:39.581 --> 23:42.482
