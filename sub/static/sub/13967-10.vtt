(announcer) FX presents

"Tyrant."

00:19.020 --> 00:20.820
Previously on
"Tyrant"

00:20.850 --> 00:23.720
The Al Fayeed dynasty
must end.

00:23.720 --> 00:25.320
(Barry) I don't want a hair
touched on his head,

00:25.320 --> 00:26.820
but this can't be allowed
to continue.

00:28.060 --> 00:29.820
Arrest him.

00:29.820 --> 00:31.360
Fauzi Nidal is missing.

00:31.360 --> 00:33.030
I'll take Ghani and I'll go,

00:33.030 --> 00:34.660
and then when things
are better,

00:34.660 --> 00:35.630
we'll find each other again.

00:35.630 --> 00:37.500
- Do you need me to be brave?
- I really do.

00:37.830 --> 00:40.400
You need to kill your husband.

00:40.400 --> 00:42.210
(crying) You can't ask me
to do that.

00:42.240 --> 00:45.210
(Wafiq) Either I die for a reason,
or I die in vain.

00:45.240 --> 00:47.240
- (Nafisa) Wait.
- What?

00:47.240 --> 00:48.340
It tastes bad.

00:48.380 --> 00:49.880
I'm asking you to support
free elections.

00:49.910 --> 00:52.080
By abandoning
Bassam Al Fayeed.

00:52.120 --> 00:54.350
By abandoning your
support of his war.

00:54.350 --> 00:55.750
Well, what was
your recommendation?

00:56.750 --> 00:59.920
That we maintain our support
for the current President.

00:59.920 --> 01:01.160
If any of our troops

01:01.160 --> 01:02.960
get killed by soldiers
we trained,

01:02.960 --> 01:04.690
the blowback will be
immeasurable.

01:04.690 --> 01:05.890
Withdraw, General.

01:05.890 --> 01:07.000
Understood.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.730
The President orders you
to surrender.

01:08.730 --> 01:10.070
It is time to stand down.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.100
Go home, General.

01:11.130 --> 01:12.270
What the hell are you doing?

01:12.270 --> 01:13.940
Bassam and I,

01:13.940 --> 01:15.370
we hold each other's hearts.

01:15.400 --> 01:16.870
Daliyah,
what are you doing here?

01:16.870 --> 01:19.880
- Your wife summoned me.
- Why?

01:19.880 --> 01:21.000
What are you waiting for?

01:21.000 --> 01:21.940
Are you gonna choose
your whore

01:21.940 --> 01:22.950
or your own daughter?

01:22.950 --> 01:23.910
You're under arrest.

01:23.950 --> 01:25.980
Take this woman
into custody.

01:26.010 --> 01:28.120
(Daliyah) I'm going on
a hunger strike.

01:28.150 --> 01:30.320
You can change your course.

01:32.090 --> 01:33.590
Or you can watch me die.

01:38.360 --> 01:40.600
(man singing in Arabic)

01:40.600 --> 01:42.600
(engine roars)

01:42.600 --> 01:47.600
(people chat indistinctly)

01:54.280 --> 01:57.410
We're 72 hours
from going to war...

01:57.450 --> 02:00.080
with the strongest army
Abuddin has ever had.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.950
Thanks to
General Cogswell.

02:01.950 --> 02:03.350
Ironically, yes.

02:03.350 --> 02:06.350
(helicopter whirring)

02:07.930 --> 02:09.430
(liquor sloshing)

02:09.430 --> 02:10.490
Might as well, right?

02:10.830 --> 02:11.960
Can't take it with you.

02:11.990 --> 02:13.930
Not post 9/11 anyway.

02:13.960 --> 02:15.330
(bottle stopper pops)

02:15.360 --> 02:17.770
So...
(pours liquor in glasses)

02:17.800 --> 02:20.400
- They shipping me back?
- Today.

02:20.440 --> 02:21.840
I'm still in negotiations

02:21.870 --> 02:23.470
to avoid a court martial.

02:23.510 --> 02:25.870
I told them
I hadn't conveyed

02:25.870 --> 02:27.640
the orders clearly enough.

02:27.680 --> 02:29.440
(chuckles)

02:29.480 --> 02:32.480
I can imagine
they were dubious. (sighs)

02:32.520 --> 02:33.750
Not turning

02:33.780 --> 02:36.450
on your allies sort of
goes without saying.

02:41.060 --> 02:43.760
Why'd you do it, Bill?

02:43.790 --> 02:46.830
A 30-year career.

02:46.860 --> 02:48.600
Out of love?

02:48.630 --> 02:52.500
Not just that.

02:52.540 --> 02:54.040
This place wears you down.

02:54.070 --> 02:55.870
Failure wears you down.

02:55.870 --> 02:58.310
After a while,
you just want to say,"Fuck it,"

02:58.340 --> 03:00.640
and do what you think
is right.

03:00.680 --> 03:03.980
Oh, boy, you really were done,
weren't you?

03:04.010 --> 03:06.010
(chuckles) Yeah.

03:08.320 --> 03:09.890
Yeah.

03:09.920 --> 03:12.150
What move do we have left?

03:12.150 --> 03:14.220
I think maybe we
need to be bolder.

03:14.220 --> 03:15.790
Mobilize the people
around the truth

03:15.790 --> 03:17.630
that I'm the legitimate
President of Abuddin.

03:17.660 --> 03:18.990
Even before he left,

03:19.030 --> 03:20.700
I was pulling ahead
of Fauzi Nidal.

03:20.730 --> 03:22.400
That is a hollow victory now.

03:22.430 --> 03:23.800
Not necessarily.

03:23.800 --> 03:25.570
Not if we use that fact
to establish

03:25.600 --> 03:28.500
a government-in-exile
inside Ma'an.

03:28.540 --> 03:30.710
Not the opposition anymore,

03:30.740 --> 03:32.070
but the true government.

03:32.110 --> 03:34.410
We call in the question.

03:34.440 --> 03:38.580
It could trigger a very
aggressive response.

03:39.550 --> 03:41.680
I know you're trying
to protect me.

03:41.720 --> 03:43.920
Both of you.

03:46.890 --> 03:48.090
But if the sheik stands
with me

03:48.120 --> 03:50.460
it's a risk I'm
willing to take.

03:58.370 --> 04:00.540
This is my home.

04:00.670 --> 04:01.740
I'm not going anywhere.

04:05.640 --> 04:06.780
My fighters will stay.

04:06.810 --> 04:07.810
Good.

04:09.010 --> 04:12.550
Tomorrow we'll announce
the formation of our government.

04:12.580 --> 04:15.820
You're gonna have to speak up,
it's a little noisy in here.

04:15.850 --> 04:17.890
(Leila) How long before
they take you?

04:17.920 --> 04:20.019
By the looks of things,
ten minutes.

04:20.060 --> 04:24.130
This is the second time
you've left this place

04:24.130 --> 04:26.630
because of me.

04:26.660 --> 04:29.030
Given up everything for me.

04:29.060 --> 04:32.070
Yeah, well,
I'm not a big talker.

04:32.100 --> 04:35.140
It's...

04:35.170 --> 04:37.840
how I express love.

04:43.850 --> 04:46.480
What's going to happen to you?

04:46.510 --> 04:49.020
(Cogswell) Court martial, I imagine.

04:49.050 --> 04:50.990
No, they can't.

04:51.020 --> 04:52.250
I'll talk to someone.

04:52.290 --> 04:54.690
Leila, listen to me.

04:54.720 --> 04:57.230
We can't help each other
anymore.

04:57.260 --> 04:59.060
You need to speak to Exley.

04:59.090 --> 05:01.530
Get the State Department
to grant you asylum.

05:01.560 --> 05:03.530
You need to get out.

05:03.570 --> 05:07.070
I could be with you.

05:09.700 --> 05:12.540
Except I can't. (sobs)

05:12.570 --> 05:15.740
I can't have made you
sacrifice for a lost cause.

05:15.780 --> 05:19.010
A good cause is a good
cause, lost or not.

05:19.050 --> 05:20.950
You need to hang up,
General.

05:20.980 --> 05:23.020
It's time to go.

05:23.050 --> 05:24.220
I have to go.

05:24.250 --> 05:26.250
Okay.

05:29.060 --> 05:32.060
You've come back once before.

05:32.090 --> 05:33.200
You'll come back again.

05:33.230 --> 05:35.600
General.

05:35.630 --> 05:36.830
I have to go.

05:36.830 --> 05:38.830
(line disconnected)

05:41.600 --> 05:43.770
(crying)

05:44.770 --> 05:46.770
(crickets chirping)

05:52.770 --> 05:54.770
(thud)

06:16.870 --> 06:18.870
(light kiss)

06:23.800 --> 06:27.480
- What are you doing?
- Remembering.

06:27.480 --> 06:30.320
The children are
barely asleep.

06:30.320 --> 06:32.290
Good for them.

06:32.320 --> 06:34.320
I'm just waking up.

06:40.230 --> 06:42.230
(smooches)

06:42.230 --> 06:44.230
(moans)

06:45.070 --> 06:47.170
God has made me
so lucky.

06:54.180 --> 06:57.850
(Molly) Is it very painful?

06:57.850 --> 07:00.650
(Daliyah) You sound
a bit sadistic,

07:00.680 --> 07:02.820
just so you know.

07:02.850 --> 07:04.720
Not at all.

07:04.750 --> 07:06.690
I don't want you to suffer.

07:09.190 --> 07:10.830
You put me here.

07:10.860 --> 07:14.700
That was Barry's doing,
not mine.

07:16.160 --> 07:18.030
I made it easier for him,

07:18.070 --> 07:20.770
but it was his decision,
first and last.

07:22.040 --> 07:25.440
Has he come
to see you again?

07:28.840 --> 07:31.210
He won't.
He's done with you.

07:36.180 --> 07:38.190
(Molly sighs)

07:44.030 --> 07:45.030
I think he loved you

07:45.030 --> 07:47.100
more than he ever loved me.

07:49.460 --> 07:51.930
(sighs)

07:51.970 --> 07:55.470
What a thing to have to say
to another woman.

07:57.270 --> 08:00.410
He doesn't understand how
you could have abandoned him.

08:01.810 --> 08:04.350
I think you've
destroyed him.

08:04.380 --> 08:08.720
You know what the most
terrible thing is?

08:08.750 --> 08:11.390
There was no reason.

08:11.420 --> 08:13.660
The election timeline
was always arbitrary.

08:13.660 --> 08:15.220
He could have set it
for 12 months away

08:15.220 --> 08:17.790
instead of six.

08:22.900 --> 08:26.200
Your child is alive.

08:26.230 --> 08:29.770
Mine is dead.

08:29.770 --> 08:32.470
She would've
been 19 in two days.

08:32.510 --> 08:36.179
After waiting all this
time for a democracy,

08:36.179 --> 08:37.309
what harm could it do

08:37.350 --> 08:39.409
to wait a few more months
till the men who murdered her

08:39.450 --> 08:40.880
are punished?

08:40.919 --> 08:42.520
You know.

08:45.090 --> 08:47.990
You know exactly
what harm it does.

08:49.790 --> 08:51.830
Otherwise, I wouldn't be
in this prison

08:51.860 --> 08:54.500
for disagreeing with you.

09:08.280 --> 09:10.280
(cell door shuts)

09:24.890 --> 09:26.430
Hussein?

09:26.430 --> 09:30.130
What is it?

09:30.170 --> 09:32.500
- Please...
- (Nafisa yells)

09:36.240 --> 09:38.840
Please don't hurt my children.

09:40.110 --> 09:43.210
Ihab only sent us to finish
what you couldn't.

Exley just called.

Al-Qadi's dead.

11:23.150 --> 11:25.580
What? How?

11:25.610 --> 11:27.950
So this is news to you?

11:27.980 --> 11:28.620
Well, of course.

11:28.620 --> 11:31.990
Don't you think I would have
come to you the moment I fo...

11:31.990 --> 11:35.060
Wait, you think
I'm responsible.

11:35.090 --> 11:36.320
Is it so improbable?

11:36.360 --> 11:38.290
I would never do
anything so consequential

11:38.330 --> 11:40.660
without your approval.

11:43.500 --> 11:44.670
Okay.

11:46.300 --> 11:48.400
But Leila will find a way
to use this against us.

11:48.440 --> 11:51.270
Maybe, but this could also
be a lucky bounce for us.

11:51.310 --> 11:55.140
Leila Al Fayeed is hardly
the face of an Islamist Party.

11:56.140 --> 11:58.140
(sighs deeply)

11:58.510 --> 12:01.420
Have the children eaten?

12:01.450 --> 12:03.650
Latif?

12:03.690 --> 12:06.690
The children need
to eat something.

12:06.720 --> 12:08.490
I worry about Kamilah.

12:08.520 --> 12:11.430
She won't eat.

12:11.460 --> 12:13.760
She saw blood.
Her uncle's blood...

12:13.800 --> 12:17.670
I shouldn't have
brought them here.

12:17.700 --> 12:19.500
Things are the same
everywhere.

12:19.530 --> 12:21.270
Governments killing
their own people.

12:21.300 --> 12:24.140
My brother,
who's the only person

12:24.140 --> 12:25.570
who could have
changed things.

12:25.570 --> 12:26.770
And now he's gone.

12:26.810 --> 12:28.110
And his coalition's
gone.

12:28.110 --> 12:30.180
It's just over.
(thudding)

12:36.420 --> 12:39.390
Let me help you.

12:39.420 --> 12:41.390
I'm sorry.

12:41.420 --> 12:43.560
Politics can wait.

12:43.590 --> 12:45.730
You're in mourning now.

12:45.760 --> 12:48.230
That's all
that matters.

12:51.230 --> 12:53.970
(Molly) It's bad now, but her hunger
pangs should disappear

12:53.970 --> 12:55.400
in the next day
or two.

12:55.440 --> 12:57.510
She'll actually feel better
just as her body starts

12:57.540 --> 13:00.680
to break down.
That's the ironic thing.

13:00.710 --> 13:03.410
Why are you telling me this?

13:05.080 --> 13:07.050
Never mind. Forget it.

13:07.080 --> 13:10.250
Why did you go there?
What did you say to her?

13:10.290 --> 13:13.690
I told her she hurt you.
That she was wrong.

13:13.720 --> 13:15.390
I thought you might thank me
for that. (closes drawer)

13:15.420 --> 13:17.090
For saving you the pain
of seeing her again.

13:17.090 --> 13:19.030
(cup clinking)

13:19.030 --> 13:21.030
An Amnesty representative
showed up as I was leaving

13:21.130 --> 13:23.600
to check on our treatment
of political prisoners.

13:23.630 --> 13:25.500
I was asked to excuse myself.

13:25.530 --> 13:28.440
I'm sure she said things to him.

13:30.610 --> 13:32.240
She's dangerous.

13:32.270 --> 13:34.440
Outside of prison or in.

13:36.810 --> 13:39.250
If anything happens to her...

13:41.120 --> 13:43.320

- If she ends up

13:43.320 --> 13:46.550
dead in her cell one morning,
like Nusrat, unexplained...

13:46.590 --> 13:48.590
Is that really what you think
of me?

13:48.620 --> 13:51.460
I don't know.

13:51.490 --> 13:54.130
I don't know
what our limits are anymore.

13:54.160 --> 13:57.600
My limits? Jesus.

13:57.630 --> 13:59.600
What kind of monster's inside
of you

13:59.630 --> 14:02.300
that makes you see monsters
in other people?

14:05.240 --> 14:08.810
Nothing happens to that woman.

14:09.810 --> 14:11.480
Understood?

14:12.680 --> 14:15.620
If anyone killed her,
it was you.

14:15.650 --> 14:17.820
When you gave her that job.

14:22.100 --> 14:25.100
(people chat indistinctly)

14:27.160 --> 14:29.460
(Safiya) My sister is stubborn.

14:29.500 --> 14:32.300

14:32.330 --> 14:34.840

14:34.870 --> 14:36.670
I worry for all of us.

the police are behind us.

he charging her with?

14:55.090 --> 14:56.160
(Aziz) I'm trying
to find out,

14:56.160 --> 14:58.490
but I have very few people left
inside the Palace.

14:58.530 --> 15:01.230
General Maloof has purged
most of my sources.

15:01.230 --> 15:04.200
If I'm the one he's trying to stop,
why not come for me?

15:04.230 --> 15:06.800
You can probably answer that
better than I can.

15:08.700 --> 15:10.540
I'm sure
this is just harassment.

15:10.540 --> 15:12.870
The Palace is issuing
a statement about Al-Qadi.

15:12.910 --> 15:15.480
Denying responsibility.

15:15.510 --> 15:18.480
President Al Fayeed acknowledges
the sheik's opposition

15:18.510 --> 15:21.480
to his rule, but he
also recognizes his commitment

15:21.520 --> 15:22.980
to the people of Abuddin.

15:23.020 --> 15:24.990
That the Caliphate
would assassinate him

15:25.020 --> 15:26.950
is a measure of their fear.

15:26.990 --> 15:28.890
It underscores the importance

15:28.920 --> 15:30.930
of the President's efforts
to destroy

15:30.930 --> 15:33.530
this evil
before it infects Abuddin...

15:33.560 --> 15:36.030
- He's exploiting this.
- The sheik's supporters

15:36.030 --> 15:38.730
won't listen to Bassam.
Not anymore.

15:38.770 --> 15:40.970
Maybe not all of them.
And maybe not right now.

15:40.970 --> 15:44.640
But without...

15:44.670 --> 15:47.640

15:47.680 --> 15:49.810
it's only a matter of time

he stood for are gone, too.

That's what I want.

27:16.660 --> 27:19.800
Thank God you're all right.

27:19.830 --> 27:22.940
If General Maloof even
laid a finger on you,

27:22.970 --> 27:24.210
so help me God.

27:24.240 --> 27:26.610
I'm fine, Leila, really.

27:26.640 --> 27:29.110
He was just using me
to get to you.

27:29.110 --> 27:31.350
I put you at risk.
I know that.

27:31.380 --> 27:34.780
I put everyone at risk.

27:34.820 --> 27:37.950
After they arrested you,
I thought...

27:37.990 --> 27:40.820
I thought of giving up, truly.

27:40.860 --> 27:42.720
And?

27:42.760 --> 27:44.990
I can't, Safiya.

27:45.030 --> 27:47.360
I can't now.

27:48.760 --> 27:51.000
I need you to say
you understand.

27:51.030 --> 27:54.870
Even if it goes wrong,
even if we fail.

27:54.870 --> 27:56.840
We're here, madam.

Safiya?

28:00.410 --> 28:03.310
Tell me what your plan is.

28:03.310 --> 28:05.010
I'll tell you when I see you.

28:05.050 --> 28:08.880
But I need to know
that you're still on my side.

28:11.050 --> 28:13.590
Of course I am on your side.

28:13.590 --> 28:17.020
I'm always on your side.

28:18.190 --> 28:19.860
I love you.

Thank you for meeting us.

28:49.890 --> 28:52.090
It's good to see you again,
Siddiq.

28:53.460 --> 28:54.730
Madam.

28:54.730 --> 28:57.200
I believe last time we met
you threw blood at me.

28:57.230 --> 28:59.400
It's okay.

28:59.430 --> 29:02.800
I deserved it.

And now you're
asking for my help?

29:05.270 --> 29:08.080
You and I want
a democratic Abuddin.

29:08.110 --> 29:10.440
I know I'm not perfect.

29:10.440 --> 29:13.980
But I am the closest thing there
is to the people's choice.

29:15.150 --> 29:16.980
Go on.

29:17.020 --> 29:20.820
I'm going to announce myself as
the true president of Abuddin.

29:22.120 --> 29:23.560
I could say that
in Ma'an.

29:23.560 --> 29:24.930
But to say it in Asima

29:24.960 --> 29:26.760
at your sit-in,

29:26.790 --> 29:28.900
within sight of the Palace,
within earshot,

29:28.930 --> 29:31.100
so Bassam can hear me
take the oath.

29:31.130 --> 29:33.470
Why would he ever
allow that to happen?

29:33.470 --> 29:35.970
Such a direct insult?

29:36.000 --> 29:39.170
He'll have you arrested first
or killed.

29:39.210 --> 29:41.440
He won't know.

29:41.480 --> 29:43.880
And by the time
he finds out,

29:43.880 --> 29:45.310
it will be done.

29:45.350 --> 29:46.810
And I'll be gone.

29:46.850 --> 29:50.020
And it will be
too late.

Is there something
you need?

30:03.400 --> 30:06.330
Yes.

Can it wait
until morning?

30:08.370 --> 30:10.800
It's, uh, been a difficult day.

30:10.840 --> 30:13.200
I still have dozens
of deployment orders

30:13.200 --> 30:15.180
left to sign.
(drops watch, thuds)

30:15.180 --> 30:17.340
We go to war in 36 hours.

30:17.340 --> 30:18.550
I know.

30:18.580 --> 30:20.920
I know how much
that cost you.

30:25.990 --> 30:28.820
Barry... (sighs)

30:28.860 --> 30:32.230
I need...

30:32.260 --> 30:35.900
I need to feel life again.

30:35.930 --> 30:39.730

instead of just endings.

30:39.730 --> 30:41.470
I don't know what that...

30:41.470 --> 30:43.500
I want a baby.

30:43.540 --> 30:46.340
I want you to give me a baby.

30:46.370 --> 30:48.210
Oh, no, God...

30:48.240 --> 30:49.340
- Molly...
- I want you to.

I'm asking you to.

Molly...

30:56.450 --> 30:58.820
we don't love each other.

30:58.820 --> 31:01.220
And we haven't even touched
each other for months.

31:01.220 --> 31:04.830
- I'm not asking you to love me.

31:04.830 --> 31:06.790
I'm asking you to provide me
with a child.

31:06.790 --> 31:08.530
It's a physical act,
that's all.

31:08.530 --> 31:09.800
There is no way...

31:09.800 --> 31:10.930
You owe me this.

31:13.100 --> 31:15.370
No, don't do that.

31:15.400 --> 31:17.070
You could've let me die.

31:17.100 --> 31:19.270
You should've let me die,
but you chose me.

31:19.270 --> 31:20.540
Yes.

31:20.570 --> 31:23.210
I did.

31:23.240 --> 31:26.550
And I'm sorry.

31:26.580 --> 31:29.080
But that's done.

31:29.120 --> 31:31.090
And we cannot replace her.

31:31.120 --> 31:33.450
Never.

31:33.490 --> 31:35.520
But if I have
to live without her

31:35.560 --> 31:38.090
and without you,

31:38.130 --> 31:39.890
I need another reason.

31:39.930 --> 31:42.060
Give me a child.

31:42.100 --> 31:43.560
Molly.

31:43.600 --> 31:45.330
I am your wife still.

31:45.330 --> 31:46.570
And I have stayed here with you

31:47.570 --> 31:49.940
by your side
for the sake of your dream...

31:49.970 --> 31:52.640

it's cost me everything.

You're an optimist.

32:47.490 --> 32:49.330
Trusting an Al Fayeed like that.

32:49.360 --> 32:51.130
I'm trusting you.

who's on the platform.

who have never been asked.

Right here
under my nose?

33:07.480 --> 33:09.650
President in exile?

33:09.680 --> 33:11.620
She wouldn't dare.

33:11.650 --> 33:14.020
I have a reliable source.

Maloof.

33:16.220 --> 33:19.790

in Leila's best self-interest.

33:26.270 --> 33:28.300
And her own.

33:28.340 --> 33:30.200
You helped her to understand?

33:30.240 --> 33:31.970
When Leila arrives,

33:31.970 --> 33:33.570
there will be
nobody left to hear her.

Yes.

word will get back
to the Palace,

39:41.640 --> 39:42.840
Halima!

39:42.880 --> 39:44.550
(gunfire, people screaming)

39:49.900 --> 39:52.550
(bullets bounce)

39:52.550 --> 39:54.550
(women screaming)

39:58.750 --> 40:00.500
Nooo!!!

40:03.660 --> 40:05.070
Halima...

40:11.140 --> 40:12.810
(grunts)

40:14.240 --> 40:16.180
(man cries out)

40:20.180 --> 40:22.620
(gunfire and screaming continue)

40:26.290 --> 40:28.690
(helicopter whirring in distance)

40:34.860 --> 40:36.660
(through radio) We can't land
in the middle of that.

40:36.700 --> 40:38.990
This was meant for me.
To stop me.

40:38.990 --> 40:40.670
That's not possible.

40:40.700 --> 40:42.000
No one knew
you were coming.

40:45.810 --> 40:47.710
Get us out of here.

40:49.710 --> 40:53.680
(gunfire, screaming continues)

40:53.680 --> 40:57.680
(helicopter engine roars)
(sound fading)

41:03.720 --> 41:04.860
Halima!

41:04.890 --> 41:06.090
Hey.
Come on.

41:06.130 --> 41:07.260
No, no, no,
I have to find Sammy.

41:07.290 --> 41:10.330
Halima, we can't stay here.

41:13.230 --> 41:15.200
Aaliyah,
we have to go.

41:15.240 --> 41:16.670
Halima...

41:16.700 --> 41:18.240
(Nabil) Come on.

41:24.250 --> 41:26.010
I'll take care of you, okay?

41:26.050 --> 41:27.880
I'll take care of you.

41:27.910 --> 41:29.550
Put pressure on the wound.

41:31.990 --> 41:33.350
Nabil, Listen to me!

41:33.350 --> 41:34.560
- Put pressure on the wound.
- Okay.

41:34.590 --> 41:36.920
(weakly) Tell my parents...

41:38.760 --> 41:40.930
Keep the pressure on the
wound to stop the bleeding.

41:40.930 --> 41:42.060
I'm trying.

41:42.100 --> 41:43.660
- (Sammy) Halima!
- Sammy.

41:43.660 --> 41:44.670
- They're moving in.
- Sammy!

41:44.700 --> 41:48.200
Halima!
Oh, Aaliyah.

41:50.170 --> 41:53.010
She's dead.
She's dead.

41:53.040 --> 41:54.210
We have to go.
Come on.

41:54.240 --> 41:55.840
- Let's go.
- (Nabil) Halima, come on.

41:55.840 --> 41:58.010
(Sammy) Keep your head down.
Keep your head down!

41:58.040 --> 42:00.850
(gunfire, people screaming)
(Sammy grunts)

42:00.850 --> 42:03.580
- Sammy!
- (Sammy groaning)

42:03.620 --> 42:06.890
- No, no, no.
- We have to get you out of here.

42:06.920 --> 42:08.150
Oh, no, don't...
don't move me.

42:08.190 --> 42:09.790
It's okay.
You'll be okay.

42:11.020 --> 42:13.000
Professor!

42:13.000 --> 42:14.760
Professor El-Amin!

42:16.630 --> 42:18.870
I can't... I can't feel...

42:18.900 --> 42:20.770
Shh.

42:20.800 --> 42:22.270
Professor El-Amin!

42:22.270 --> 42:23.970
- Hey, get down!
- Professor El-Amin!

42:24.910 --> 42:27.040
Help us!

42:37.050 --> 42:38.320
Leave us alone.

42:40.020 --> 42:42.020
(cell door closes)

42:42.020 --> 42:44.020
(locks door)

42:48.330 --> 42:49.830
Hey.

42:56.800 --> 42:58.340
You have to stop this.

43:02.010 --> 43:05.080
You're torturing me.

43:08.350 --> 43:09.980
I can't.

43:12.450 --> 43:16.260
I can't let you die.

43:16.290 --> 43:17.660
If you die,

43:17.690 --> 43:19.190
I die.

43:26.800 --> 43:28.770
I love you.

43:28.800 --> 43:33.740
What do you want me to say?

43:33.770 --> 43:36.410
(soft chuckle)

43:36.440 --> 43:38.990
I would've given up all
of this for you.

43:42.790 --> 43:47.290
I don't care about any of it
the way that I care about you.

43:49.320 --> 43:54.700
And I know that I have
wrecked everything I built.

43:54.730 --> 43:56.200
Everyone I love.

43:56.230 --> 44:01.900
But if you had seen
what I saw...

44:04.300 --> 44:07.870
(sighs)

44:12.010 --> 44:15.250
I know.

44:18.320 --> 44:21.920
I don't want to lose you,
and I've already lost you.

44:27.360 --> 44:31.600
It can't be that this is why we
met, just to destroy each other.

44:31.600 --> 44:32.900
I don't believe that.

44:32.930 --> 44:35.000
No, no.

44:35.040 --> 44:37.640
No, you're the love of my life.

44:37.640 --> 44:42.010
You're the love of my life.

44:42.040 --> 44:44.410
You gave me my life.

44:51.280 --> 44:56.020
Of all the places in the world,

44:56.060 --> 45:00.190
they carried me
into your village.

45:00.230 --> 45:02.500
What were the chances of that?

45:02.530 --> 45:06.130
So who knows.

45:08.200 --> 45:10.940
We're both still alive.

45:12.570 --> 45:17.140
There's hope right there.

45:23.550 --> 45:26.550
(indistinct announcement over P.A.)

45:27.490 --> 45:29.320
How is he?

45:29.320 --> 45:30.860
He's still in surgery.

45:30.860 --> 45:32.960
Where were you?

45:32.990 --> 45:35.000
What was he doing
at the University?

45:36.600 --> 45:40.530
- He was there to see you, wasn't he?
- What? No, that's not...

45:40.570 --> 45:41.970
He's just a kid!

45:42.000 --> 45:44.270
And you put him at
risk, over and over again.

45:44.270 --> 45:46.040
- That's not what happened.
- Bullshit!

45:46.040 --> 45:48.440
Bassam, Bassam, no, no, no,
he saved him.

45:48.470 --> 45:50.910
He saved Sammy's life.

45:50.940 --> 45:52.180
(Halima) Bassam...

45:53.910 --> 45:56.320
He helped us carry him
out of the Square.

45:56.350 --> 45:58.920
He put him in his car,
it's not his fault, it's mine.

46:03.420 --> 46:06.990
I'm sorry.

46:07.030 --> 46:09.860
No one was supposed to
fire any shots.

46:15.040 --> 46:16.840
I don't know who you are.

46:16.870 --> 46:20.010
My name is Haitham.

46:20.040 --> 46:21.980
Haitham El-Amin.

46:23.310 --> 46:26.580
I'm in love with your son.

46:26.610 --> 46:29.480
(softly) Oh.

46:29.520 --> 46:32.920
(doctor) Mr. President?

46:32.950 --> 46:34.650
Madam First Lady.

46:34.690 --> 46:37.090
We were able to
remove the bullet.

46:37.120 --> 46:38.590
Control the bleeding.

46:38.620 --> 46:41.290
- He should be out of danger.
- (both sigh in relief)

46:41.290 --> 46:45.300
But fragments
affected his spine.

46:45.330 --> 46:48.070
We won't know for some time if
there is any permanent damage.

46:48.800 --> 46:50.200
Okay.

46:50.240 --> 46:52.140
Okay, but he's alive.
He's gonna live.

46:52.170 --> 46:54.610
Okay.

46:54.640 --> 46:56.280
How long till I can see him?

46:56.310 --> 46:58.110
It will be hours still.

46:58.140 --> 47:01.480
Okay, thank you, Doctor.

47:01.510 --> 47:04.480
(both sigh)

47:17.200 --> 47:19.530
Are you cold?
Can I get you something?

47:19.570 --> 47:21.000
No.

47:24.610 --> 47:26.840
I don't...

47:30.380 --> 47:35.180
You try to live your life
a certain way.

47:35.180 --> 47:37.020
Believing in certain things.

47:37.020 --> 47:39.520
But the world...

47:39.550 --> 47:41.790
people...

47:41.790 --> 47:43.830
some people...

47:45.230 --> 47:47.530
they won't leave you alone.

47:50.760 --> 47:53.340
And you have to fight back,
don't you?

47:55.070 --> 47:58.010
Otherwise...

47:59.500 --> 48:03.110
But as soon you do
fight back...

48:04.050 --> 48:07.510
you're changed.

48:08.050 --> 48:10.220
And everything is tainted.

48:13.220 --> 48:17.290
And no one is right.

48:17.320 --> 48:20.230
(footsteps approaching)

48:23.230 --> 48:24.230
Mr. President.

48:25.300 --> 48:27.070
I have to get you

48:27.100 --> 48:29.640
back to the Palace
to deliver your speech.

48:31.640 --> 48:33.340
My son is in surgery, General.

48:33.340 --> 48:34.610
Shot by your troops.

48:36.010 --> 48:38.640
The speech can wait.

48:38.680 --> 48:40.750
With all do respect,
it can't.

48:40.780 --> 48:44.250
Your army marches
in a matter of hours.

48:44.280 --> 48:46.520
You have to tell the country.

48:49.090 --> 48:53.790
He's gonna be in surgery
for a long time.

48:53.790 --> 48:55.760
And I'll be here.

48:55.760 --> 48:59.760
♪♪

49:25.360 --> 49:26.590
You've made changes?

49:26.630 --> 49:28.660
A few.

49:28.690 --> 49:31.600
You've taken out all
the references to elections

49:31.630 --> 49:33.130
following the end of the war.

49:33.170 --> 49:34.770
"Because we are
a free people..."

49:34.770 --> 49:35.840
That's about the election.

49:35.840 --> 49:36.800
It doesn't mean anything

49:36.840 --> 49:38.900
- without the sentence before.
- I don't think

49:38.900 --> 49:40.340
we should
get ahead of ourselves.

49:40.370 --> 49:42.440
Let's stick to
the matter at hand.

49:42.480 --> 49:44.510
The election is
the whole point.

49:44.540 --> 49:47.150
A secure democracy is
the reason we're going to war.

49:47.180 --> 49:48.910
You should read the speech!

49:53.190 --> 49:55.660
Everybody out.

49:55.690 --> 49:57.890
I said everybody out!

50:04.560 --> 50:06.400
(door shuts)

50:06.430 --> 50:08.300
I am the President, General.

50:08.330 --> 50:09.740
- Yes, you are.
- Okay, then...

50:09.770 --> 50:11.900
Serving at my pleasure.

50:13.170 --> 50:14.570
Oh,

50:14.610 --> 50:19.150
you've just woken up,
have you?

50:19.180 --> 50:20.480
Good morning!

50:20.510 --> 50:23.820
You've alienated
every other ally you have.

50:23.850 --> 50:26.150
Without the Army's support,
what would you be?

50:26.190 --> 50:28.220
Nothing!

50:30.360 --> 50:34.190
Another deposed dictator.

50:34.230 --> 50:36.560
And the Americans
can't help you then.

50:41.470 --> 50:44.740
My son is in the hospital,
fighting for his life.

50:44.770 --> 50:46.470
My daughter is dead.

50:48.870 --> 50:52.380
My wife and I have given
everything that we love

50:52.410 --> 50:53.910
for this cause...

50:53.950 --> 50:55.850
(scoffs)

50:55.880 --> 50:58.350
General, what is the point
of the war

50:58.380 --> 51:00.020
if we're no different
from anyone else?

51:00.020 --> 51:01.090
What are we fighting for?

51:01.090 --> 51:02.990
To be the last man standing,
of course.

51:02.990 --> 51:05.160
I promised the people elections!

51:05.160 --> 51:06.760
Then you broke your promise!

51:06.790 --> 51:08.290
(sighs)

51:08.330 --> 51:09.930
You think principles
are something you can

51:09.930 --> 51:12.060
put in your pocket,
take out every now and then,

51:12.060 --> 51:14.300
whenever it suits you!

51:14.330 --> 51:16.670
Don't look at me
as if I did this to you!

51:17.670 --> 51:19.710
You are the architect!

51:19.740 --> 51:21.970
This is your doing.

51:24.740 --> 51:26.650
I am your doing.

51:27.650 --> 51:28.880
Now, read the speech.

51:28.880 --> 51:29.950
No!

51:31.780 --> 51:33.950
Read your own
goddamn speech.

51:33.990 --> 51:36.160
The man who murdered
your daughter

51:36.160 --> 51:37.560
is on the other side
of the border.

51:37.590 --> 51:40.660
The student that started
the riot that claimed your son

51:40.690 --> 51:42.460
supported him.

51:45.800 --> 51:47.670
Huh?

51:51.970 --> 51:53.440
You wrote this speech.

51:53.470 --> 51:54.740
You planned this war.

51:54.770 --> 51:56.840
And I am going to
win it for you.

51:56.880 --> 51:58.840
And kill that man.

51:58.880 --> 52:00.850
Make you the president for life.

52:00.850 --> 52:03.620
With me at your right hand.

52:03.650 --> 52:05.920
That was the bargain
you made.

52:05.950 --> 52:08.590
At some point,
through all the delusion,

52:08.620 --> 52:10.920
you must have begun
to realize that.

52:10.960 --> 52:13.430
You were never going back

52:13.460 --> 52:15.960
to be a doctor in Pasadena.

52:16.000 --> 52:18.630
And it's this...

52:18.660 --> 52:23.070
or the death
of every last Al Fayeed.

52:24.640 --> 52:26.810
Read the speech.

52:29.910 --> 52:31.610
(Barry on TV) Even now,
our tanks are moving

52:31.610 --> 52:32.810
across our border

52:32.850 --> 52:34.990
and our planes
are headed to targets

52:34.990 --> 52:37.980
deep inside territory
held by the so-called Caliphate.

52:38.020 --> 52:39.390
With this war,

52:39.420 --> 52:41.150
we vow never to live in fear

52:41.150 --> 52:42.990
of men who twist our religion

52:43.020 --> 52:45.060
into a manifesto of hate.

52:47.730 --> 52:50.030
Because we are a free people.

52:50.060 --> 52:52.900
And we will remain
a free people.

52:52.930 --> 52:55.400
God bless our soldiers.

52:55.440 --> 52:56.970
God bless you all.

52:57.000 --> 53:00.440
And may God bless Abuddin.

53:03.610 --> 53:05.410
It'll be okay,

53:05.450 --> 53:07.480
in the end.

53:07.510 --> 53:09.380
You'll see.

53:16.120 --> 53:19.020
(Ihab) The moment I have been
warning us would come,

53:19.060 --> 53:20.730
has come.

53:20.760 --> 53:22.900
The American Al Fayeed,

53:22.930 --> 53:24.660
with his American weapons,

53:24.700 --> 53:28.500
has crossed the border
to invade our land.

53:28.530 --> 53:31.200
Tonight, I call on the faithful

53:31.200 --> 53:32.870
from all over the world...

53:32.910 --> 53:35.380
and especially those living
under occupation

53:35.410 --> 53:36.580
inside Abuddin...

53:36.610 --> 53:38.680
join us

53:38.710 --> 53:41.080
in fighting this tyrant

53:41.110 --> 53:44.380
and his Crusader army.

53:44.420 --> 53:46.720
God bless Abuddin.

53:46.750 --> 53:50.060
(voices chanting) Leila, Leila,
Leila, Leila...

53:50.090 --> 53:51.890
(microphone feedback)

53:51.920 --> 53:55.460
Sometimes,

53:55.500 --> 53:58.860
we come so close

53:58.900 --> 54:00.570
to catching a glimpse
of the world

54:00.600 --> 54:02.500
the way we wish it could be.

54:04.100 --> 54:07.070
It's just over there:

54:07.110 --> 54:09.680
around one more corner.

54:10.740 --> 54:14.650
And then it disappears.

54:14.680 --> 54:16.550
Again.

54:16.580 --> 54:19.990
And we begin
to feel defeated.

54:20.020 --> 54:23.960
And after a while, we feel like

54:23.990 --> 54:27.430
we don't even
deserve any better.

54:27.460 --> 54:30.130
That this is how it is.

54:30.160 --> 54:34.570
But how it is...
is always for us to say.

54:34.600 --> 54:37.800
Even after a thousand defeats.

54:37.840 --> 54:39.940
Battered,

54:39.970 --> 54:42.840
but not broken.

54:44.610 --> 54:48.750
We still have
the same quiet prayer,

54:48.780 --> 54:52.490
that cannot be taken from us
even by death,

54:52.520 --> 54:55.520
like a child that will
outlive us.

54:56.560 --> 54:58.520
The maybe prayer.

54:59.730 --> 55:01.760
Maybe.

55:01.790 --> 55:04.130
Maybe tomorrow.
One of these days.

55:04.160 --> 55:06.630
It will be different.

55:06.670 --> 55:11.000
I will never give up on maybe.

55:14.010 --> 55:18.510
So long as Sheik Hussein Al-Qadi
looks down on us from Paradise,

55:19.810 --> 55:23.120
and Fauzi Nidal fights
from overseas

55:23.150 --> 55:26.020
and Daliyah Al-Yazbek,
the mother of all hope,

55:26.050 --> 55:27.890
still lives.

55:27.920 --> 55:30.820
Maybe.

55:30.860 --> 55:34.230
Maybe tomorrow.

55:34.260 --> 55:36.630
If we don't give up.

55:36.660 --> 55:40.530
Who's to say
tomorrow won't be ours?

55:43.900 --> 55:45.170
Hey.

55:45.200 --> 55:46.510
Hey!

55:46.540 --> 55:48.540
You have a visitor.

55:56.180 --> 55:57.520
My name is Exley.

55:57.550 --> 55:58.520
I work for the U...

55:58.550 --> 55:59.920
I know who you are.

56:02.090 --> 56:04.660
Bassam has told me about you.

56:04.690 --> 56:06.030
Why are you here?

56:06.060 --> 56:08.590
The United States is
keeping an eye on you.

56:10.600 --> 56:11.730
Me?

56:11.760 --> 56:13.600
We like to
keep our options open.

56:13.630 --> 56:16.570
Don't waste your time.

56:16.600 --> 56:19.070
The guards tell me
we've gone to war.

56:21.610 --> 56:23.940
So this is
all for nothing.

56:23.980 --> 56:27.210
The war will go on forever.

56:27.250 --> 56:29.580
There won't ever be
an election here.

56:30.780 --> 56:33.220
I've lost.

56:33.250 --> 56:35.720
I'm a symbol of nothing.

56:35.760 --> 56:39.120
They can keep me in here forever
and no one will ever notice.

56:40.160 --> 56:42.060
Really?

56:42.090 --> 56:44.730
Fauzi Nidal has been
tweeting for you,

56:44.760 --> 56:46.200
in your name, from Jordan.

56:46.200 --> 56:47.630
Have a look.

56:53.070 --> 56:55.940
I don't...
What does this mean?

56:55.980 --> 56:58.810
You have ten million
followers.

56:59.810 --> 57:02.050
You think
you've lost?

57:02.080 --> 57:03.780
I would try to
stay alive, lady.

57:03.820 --> 57:05.080
I have a feeling

57:05.120 --> 57:07.350
you're about to matter
very much.

57:14.190 --> 57:17.800
Ghani is the name
of your son?

57:18.960 --> 57:20.430
Yes.

57:20.430 --> 57:22.030
Scroll down.

57:30.880 --> 57:33.680
"I'm being brave, Mommy.

57:33.710 --> 57:37.850
You be brave, too."

57:46.160 --> 57:48.690
(sighs shakily)

57:51.200 --> 57:54.930
I, Leila Haddad,
swear by Almighty God

57:54.970 --> 57:56.970
to uphold the laws,

57:57.000 --> 57:58.670
respect the Constitution,

57:58.670 --> 58:00.540
and faithfully
execute the duties

58:00.540 --> 58:03.180

President of Abuddin.

58:09.380 --> 58:13.190

58:35.240 --> 58:37.840
(Ahmed) That was
a good speech, Father.

58:38.840 --> 58:40.910
Thank you.

58:40.950 --> 58:42.380
You heading back
to the hospital?

58:42.410 --> 58:43.980
I thought I'd
go with you.

58:44.020 --> 58:46.050
(clears throat) Yes. In a minute.

58:46.090 --> 58:48.420
Before we go,

58:48.450 --> 58:51.390
I know it's hardly
the perfect time.

58:51.420 --> 58:53.990
But maybe it will
make you feel better.

58:54.030 --> 58:55.960
I wanted to show you something
I did for you.

58:57.030 --> 58:58.260
I commissioned it.

58:59.260 --> 59:00.770
To surprise you.

59:01.770 --> 59:03.070
I hope you like it.

59:07.970 --> 59:09.540
