01:25.760 --> 01:26.960
Whoo-hoo!

01:26.960 --> 01:29.360
- Come on, we're outta here!
- Easy, Rocky.

01:29.360 --> 01:32.360
All right, guys,
we're 15 seconds from the drop zone.

01:32.360 --> 01:35.360
All right, pinheads,
the Stealth Eagle's about to fly.

01:35.960 --> 01:38.360
Ditto for the Swooping Swallow.

01:38.360 --> 01:40.760
Well, lead on, flyboys.

01:48.560 --> 01:52.160
- That's a lotta air!
- After you, Skull!

01:52.160 --> 01:55.160
What are you? Crazy? This was your idea!

01:55.160 --> 01:59.360
Hey, guys. You might wanna slip those on.

02:01.160 --> 02:02.960
Good idea.

02:04.160 --> 02:07.160
We're three seconds away
from the target zone. Aisha, you're on!

02:07.160 --> 02:08.960
Yes!

02:09.560 --> 02:10.759
Stylin'!

02:12.560 --> 02:14.960
On your tail! Whoo!

02:14.960 --> 02:16.760
All systems go!

02:19.160 --> 02:20.360
Banzai!

02:20.960 --> 02:22.760
Whoo-hoo!

02:25.760 --> 02:28.760
- Show 'em your stuff.
- You got it. Surf's up!

02:29.360 --> 02:30.560
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

02:31.160 --> 02:33.560
Catch you on the flip side.

PA: With the arrival
of Ryan"s Comet two days away,

03:44.360 --> 03:47.960
the Angel Grove jump-a-thon will
breathe new life into the old observatory.

03:47.960 --> 03:50.960
Tickets to see the comet
are at the Fire Department booth.

03:50.960 --> 03:56.360
Now, folks, raise your eyes to the skies, cos
here comes the team from Angel Grove High!

04:00.560 --> 04:03.560
All right, Dad, pay close attention.
This is how the pros do it.

04:03.560 --> 04:07.160
- I didn't do so bad.
- You landed in the parking lot.

04:07.160 --> 04:08.960
- It was embarrassing.
- Well...

04:09.560 --> 04:12.560
PA: The first of the team
is beginning his final approach. It"s Adam!

04:12.560 --> 04:15.560
As he rounds the turn, he looks awful low...

04:15.560 --> 04:19.760
but he pulls up just in time
and hits the target dead centre.

04:19.760 --> 04:25.160
Right behind him is skydiver Billy...
who manages a perfect landing!

04:25.160 --> 04:28.160
Skydiver number three is Kimberly!

04:28.160 --> 04:31.160
Her landing is flawless!

04:31.760 --> 04:33.560
And here comes Rocky...

04:34.160 --> 04:35.360
who lands right on target!

04:35.360 --> 04:41.960
Here comes Aisha! She makes it a perfect five
out of five landing and ties the 1986 record.

04:41.960 --> 04:44.960
So now it"s all up to Tommy Oliver.
Can he make it six for six?

04:44.960 --> 04:46.760
Yeah! Go, Tommy!

04:46.760 --> 04:50.960
PA: He"s making his final approach.
Looks a bit wide, but still OK.

04:50.960 --> 04:53.360
Almost to the ground now. Can he do it?

04:53.360 --> 04:56.960
He does! The Angel Grove team
sets a new city record! Way to go, guys!

04:56.960 --> 04:58.760
- Let's go.
- OK.

04:58.760 --> 05:02.960
PA: Remember, folks, Ryan"s Comet
will be passing in just two days.

05:02.960 --> 05:06.560
- Looking good up there.
- Thanks. Maybe next time you can join us.

05:07.160 --> 05:08.360
Really? Could l?

05:08.360 --> 05:13.160
Yeah, well, we'll talk about that, Fred...
in about 10 or 1 2 years, all right?

05:13.160 --> 05:16.760
Congratulations, Tommy.
The observatory just got a new lease on life.

05:17.360 --> 05:19.160
- Yeah. Thanks, man.
- FRED: Awesome.

05:19.160 --> 05:22.160
- Ryan's Comet is passing over in two days!
- Guys, we did it!

05:22.160 --> 05:24.800
- That was awesome, Tommy.
- Wonderful.

05:24.800 --> 05:26.520
- Thanks, guys. You too, man.

05:26.520 --> 05:28.320
- Hey, has anybody seen Bulk and Skull?

05:28.320 --> 05:33.120
Ernie's is serving a free dessert with lunch.
They probably landed on the roof.

05:34.920 --> 05:38.520
- PILOT: Hurry up. We're runnin' out of fuel.
- BULK: I gotta be the eagle.

05:38.520 --> 05:40.920
I'm gonna be the eagle!

05:40.920 --> 05:43.320
Be the swallow!

05:43.320 --> 05:45.720
- Be the swallow.
- Come on, baby!

05:48.720 --> 05:51.720
- BULK: Let go of me!
- SKULL: I want my mommy!

05:57.120 --> 05:59.520
TOMMY: Rock and roll!

06:00.120 --> 06:01.320
# The mountain is high #

06:01.320 --> 06:03.120
# The valley is low #

06:03.720 --> 06:06.720
# And you're confused on
which way to go #

06:06.720 --> 06:10.320
# So I've come here to
give you a hand #

06:10.320 --> 06:13.920
# And lead you into the promised land #

06:15.720 --> 06:17.520
- Air time!
- Up and away!

06:18.720 --> 06:21.120
# Come on and take it be my side #

06:22.320 --> 06:25.320
# Come on and take a tree ride #

06:30.720 --> 06:33.120
- Let's take a shortcut.
- Right behind you!

06:34.320 --> 06:37.320
# Come on and take a free ride #

06:37.920 --> 06:41.520
# Come on and take it by my side #

06:43.920 --> 06:48.120
SKULL: Hey, this doesn't look like the target
landing zone! Where's the free food?

06:48.120 --> 06:52.320
You idiot! Your screaming threw off
the Stealth Eagle's sense of direction.

06:52.320 --> 06:55.320
Stealth Eagle? Lame duck is more like it.

06:56.520 --> 06:58.320
- Hey!
- Uh-oh.

06:58.920 --> 07:03.120
- You guys, what do you think you're doing?
- Uh...

07:04.320 --> 07:07.920
We're from the Angel Grove
Building lnspector's office.

07:08.520 --> 07:10.920
Yeah. That building's
supposed to be over there!

07:10.920 --> 07:14.520
And what's that man doing
without proper foot protection?

07:14.520 --> 07:16.920
- Who's in charge around here, huh?
- Huh?

07:16.920 --> 07:17.520
- Huh?
- Huh?

07:17.520 --> 07:19.920
Hey, Dave! Come and have a look at this.

07:21.120 --> 07:22.920
Go on, Dave.

07:24.120 --> 07:26.000
- That was a close one.
- Uh-huh.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.720
- You hungry?
- Always.

07:46.320 --> 07:49.320
What in the world is this?

07:49.320 --> 07:52.320
It sure as heck ain't DWP.

07:52.320 --> 07:54.720
Let's get a crane in here.

07:58.920 --> 08:00.720
OK, take it up!

08:28.920 --> 08:31.320
Incredible.

08:31.320 --> 08:34.320
What do you think it is?

08:34.320 --> 08:36.720
No... idea.

08:42.720 --> 08:44.520
Aaaaarrgghh!

08:48.720 --> 08:50.520
John, you all right?

08:55.920 --> 08:58.320
ROCKY: Let's get somethin' to eat.

08:58.320 --> 08:59.520
(bleeping)

08:59.520 --> 09:01.320
TOMMY: Hang on.

09:03.120 --> 09:05.520
Let's go over there.

09:10.320 --> 09:13.920
- What's up, Alpha?
- Rangers, Zordon needs you. It"s urgent.

09:14.520 --> 09:16.320
We're on our way.

09:23.880 --> 09:27.480
Aye-yai-yai-yai! The subtronic
interphasers are short-circuiting.

09:28.080 --> 09:31.080
I have to find a way to alternate
the frequency modulators.

09:34.080 --> 09:35.880
What's goin' on?

09:35.880 --> 09:40.080
A massive surge of evil energy is
overloading our sensors. Aye-yai-yai-yai-yai!

09:40.680 --> 09:42.480
Rangers, you must act swiftly.

09:43.080 --> 09:46.080
- The planet is in grave danger.
- Danger from what?

09:46.080 --> 09:50.880
6,000 years ago a morphological being
known as lvan Ooze ruled the world

09:51.480 --> 09:53.880
with a reign of unparalleled terror.

09:53.880 --> 09:57.480
He was on the verge of completing
construction of his ultimate weapons:

09:57.480 --> 10:02.880
the Ecto-Morphicon Titans, twin machines
capable of enslaving the entire universe.

10:02.880 --> 10:04.080
What happened to him?

10:04.080 --> 10:08.280
A group of warriors like yourselves
lured him to into a hyperlock chamber

10:08.280 --> 10:10.080
and buried him deep underground.

10:10.080 --> 10:13.080
But now the chamber
has been accidentally uncovered.

10:13.080 --> 10:17.280
You must return it to the depths
before it is opened and lvan is released.

10:17.280 --> 10:22.080
His Ecto-Morphicons were buried near
the chamber. If lvan escapes, he'll find them.

10:22.080 --> 10:26.880
Use extreme caution, Rangers. You're dealing
with an evil that is beyond all imagination.

10:38.760 --> 10:40.560
( snoring )

10:54.360 --> 10:57.360
- What do I care about some stupid egg?
- This is no ordinary egg!

10:57.960 --> 11:01.560
- Well, I say we hard-boil the thing!
- I'm with her. I'm hungry.

11:01.560 --> 11:06.360
- That's cos you're a pig!
- Hey, Kurt, take a look at this.

11:06.360 --> 11:11.160
No need to wake him. In fact,
why don't you take a little nap yourself?

11:17.160 --> 11:19.560
PIG: Yeah, I could do that.
I just choose not to.

11:20.160 --> 11:21.960
Zip your lips.

11:21.960 --> 11:25.560
After 2,000 years of searching...

11:25.560 --> 11:28.560
you are finally within my grasp.

11:28.560 --> 11:31.560
And now... Iet's crack this egg.

11:51.360 --> 11:53.160
Excellent.

11:56.760 --> 11:57.960
Yuck!

12:03.360 --> 12:07.560
What?! You spent 2,000 years
looking for a tub of snot?!

12:08.160 --> 12:10.560
Patience, motor-mouth. Watch.

12:14.160 --> 12:15.960
( laughs )

12:20.160 --> 12:20.760
Yes!

12:21.960 --> 12:23.160
Cool!

12:27.960 --> 12:30.360
( yawns loudly )

12:39.960 --> 12:42.960
Ladies and gentlemen!

12:42.960 --> 12:45.960
The Ooze is back!

12:45.960 --> 12:47.160
Yeah!

12:47.160 --> 12:50.160
- He's so handsome!
- Why, thank you.

12:50.160 --> 12:54.360
I am Lord Zedd, sworn enemy
of all that is good and decent.

12:54.360 --> 12:59.160
- It is a supreme honour to finally meet you.
- How can I ever repay you?

12:59.760 --> 13:03.360
Do you recall the name Zordon of Eltar?

13:11.760 --> 13:14.160
I think he's heard of him.

13:18.360 --> 13:23.760
I want you to destroy Zordon... so that
my evil may once again reign supreme!

13:23.760 --> 13:26.760
I will not only destroy him...

13:26.760 --> 13:29.760
I will obliterate his entire legacy.

13:29.760 --> 13:33.360
It will be as if Zordon of Eltar never existed!

13:33.360 --> 13:36.360
- Finally, a real man!
- ( growls )

13:38.160 --> 13:41.160
We shall leave you to weave your evil ways.

13:41.160 --> 13:42.960
Let's go, Rita.

13:53.760 --> 13:56.160
What is that odious stench?

13:58.560 --> 14:00.360
Smells like...

14:02.160 --> 14:04.560
teenagers.

14:10.560 --> 14:12.960
Anybody see anything?

14:12.960 --> 14:15.360
Let's take a look up there.

14:20.760 --> 14:21.960
Ugh!

14:23.160 --> 14:25.560
- AISHA: What is it?
- ROCKY: It reeks.

14:25.560 --> 14:28.560
Hey! What are you kids doin' here?

14:30.360 --> 14:33.960
You haven't seen a morphological being
lurking around here?

14:33.960 --> 14:36.960
- A morphological being?
- Yeah.

14:36.960 --> 14:39.360
What the heck is that?

14:39.360 --> 14:41.160
Wait a second.

14:41.160 --> 14:44.160
Did it look something like this?

14:47.760 --> 14:52.560
- Ew, gross!
- Too kind. Allow me to introduce myself.

14:52.560 --> 14:58.560
I am the galactically feared,
globally reviled, universally despised...

14:58.560 --> 15:02.160
They call me lvan Ooze.

15:02.160 --> 15:05.760
Well, pack your bags, cos we're sending
you back where you came from.

15:05.760 --> 15:09.360
Gee, a teenager with a big mouth.

15:09.960 --> 15:12.360
Not much has changed in 6,000 years.

15:12.360 --> 15:16.560
You obviously don't know
who you're dealing with, Mr Raisin Head.

15:16.560 --> 15:19.560
- Really?
- Yeah. We're the Power Rangers.

15:19.560 --> 15:23.160
Where's my autograph book? Ha!

15:23.760 --> 15:26.160
Power Rangers, huh?

15:26.160 --> 15:31.560
So Zordon's still usin'
a bunch of kids to do his dirty work.

15:32.760 --> 15:35.160
Well... meet my kids!

15:45.360 --> 15:46.560
Ew.

15:48.360 --> 15:53.760
From this moment forth
the world as you know it shall cease to exist!

15:53.760 --> 15:55.560
Welcome to my nightmare!

15:57.960 --> 15:59.160
Bye-bye, kiddies!

16:01.520 --> 16:02.720
He's gone.

16:06.920 --> 16:10.520
- What are we gonna do?
- ROCKY: There's plenty of room down there.

16:10.520 --> 16:12.320
Go, guys!

16:22.520 --> 16:24.920
- Let's take these beasts!
- Spread out!

- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

Adam!

- AISHA: They got us cornered!
- BILLY: We can't hold them off!

17:53.120 --> 17:57.320
- BILLY: There's too many of 'em.
- Let's do it, guys! It's morphin' time!

17:57.320 --> 17:59.720
Pterodactyl!

18:01.520 --> 18:03.320
Triceratops!

18:05.720 --> 18:07.520
Tyrannosaurus!

18:09.920 --> 18:11.720
Mastodon!

18:14.120 --> 18:16.520
Sabre-toothed tiger!

18:18.320 --> 18:20.120
White tiger!

18:23.120 --> 18:25.520
# Go, go, Power Rangers #

18:27.920 --> 18:30.320
# Go, go, Power Rangers #

18:30.320 --> 18:35.720
# Mighty Morphin Power Rangers #

18:37.520 --> 18:40.520
- Where'd they go?
- Keep your eyes peeled.

18:42.320 --> 18:44.120
Heads up, guys! Over there!

18:48.920 --> 18:50.720
- Careful. It could be a trap.
- Right.

18:50.720 --> 18:52.800
Let's go.

18:57.520 --> 19:01.120
Alpha, my sensors tell me
the Rangers were too late.

19:01.120 --> 19:04.120
- lvan is on his way here.
- Don't worry.

19:04.120 --> 19:07.720
Nobody enters the command centre
without a power coin.

19:07.720 --> 19:09.520
( squelching )

19:10.120 --> 19:11.920
Well, almost nobody.

19:28.120 --> 19:30.520
Hey, pretty fancy-schmancy.

19:31.120 --> 19:34.120
I guess if you invest
your money well over 60 centuries,

19:34.120 --> 19:36.520
you can buy something pretty nice.

19:37.720 --> 19:38.920
Uh-oh.

19:38.920 --> 19:40.720
( laughs )

19:41.320 --> 19:44.320
Aye-yai-yai-yai-yai-yai-yai....

19:44.320 --> 19:49.720
You haven't changed, Ooze. You're still
picking on creatures smaller than yourself.

19:49.720 --> 19:55.720
Put a sock in it, Z! 10 minutes out of the egg
and I'm listening to one of your lectures.

19:55.720 --> 19:58.720
You locked me into your
stuffy hyperlock chamber

19:58.720 --> 20:02.320
and tossed me away in the depths
like yesterday's trash.

20:02.320 --> 20:08.320
You any idea what it's like to be locked up
in a rotten egg for 6,000 years? It's boring.

20:08.320 --> 20:11.320
Not to mention I've had a charley horse
since the Renaissance.

20:11.920 --> 20:16.720
- You won't get away with this, Ooze.
- You robbed me of my prime.

20:16.720 --> 20:21.520
I was the supreme ruler
of the most foul empire in the universe.

20:21.520 --> 20:25.120
And now... it's time to pay the piper.

20:29.920 --> 20:32.320
Oh, the things that I have missed!

20:32.320 --> 20:34.120
The Black Plague!

20:35.320 --> 20:37.720
The Spanish lnquisition!

20:41.320 --> 20:43.720
The Brady Bunch reunion!

20:44.920 --> 20:46.720
( laughs )

21:09.520 --> 21:13.120
- BILLY: This place gives me the creeps.
- AISHA: I heard that.

21:19.120 --> 21:22.120
TOMMY: I've got a bad feelin'
about this place.

21:29.320 --> 21:30.520
( squawking )

21:31.720 --> 21:34.720
- KIMBERLY: Anybody see anything?
- We need some light.

21:34.720 --> 21:37.120
Activating power beam.

22:07.120 --> 22:10.120
- They gotta be around here somewhere.
- Activating power scope.

22:11.920 --> 22:14.320
TOMMY: Talk to me, Rocky. What do we got?

22:14.920 --> 22:19.720
I don't know what these purple creeps
are made of, but I can't lock 'em down.

22:19.720 --> 22:22.120
TOMMY: All right. Stay alert.

22:25.720 --> 22:28.720
- Over there!
- Let's power up!

22:28.720 --> 22:31.120
- ALL: Right!
- AISHA: Here they come!

22:35.320 --> 22:38.320
You guys make me sick, sick, sick!

22:57.520 --> 22:58.720
Back off!

23:01.120 --> 23:03.520
Have a nice flight!

23:06.520 --> 23:08.920
Later, dudes.

23:33.520 --> 23:35.920
It's gonna be one messy night.

23:43.120 --> 23:44.920
- Up and over?
- Let's do it!

23:53.920 --> 23:55.120
ADAM: Rocky, behind you!

23:56.320 --> 23:58.120
Goin' airborne!

24:01.720 --> 24:04.720
These guys don't know when to quit.
Double whammy?

24:04.720 --> 24:06.520
You're on.

24:07.720 --> 24:09.520
Uh-oh!

24:13.720 --> 24:15.520
Whoaaaa!

24:16.720 --> 24:18.520
That does it. Stegastinger!

24:23.920 --> 24:25.720
Did you miss me?

24:32.920 --> 24:35.320
Pterodactyl Thunderwhip!

24:35.320 --> 24:37.720
Have a nice trip! See you next fall.

24:41.920 --> 24:43.120
Bye-bye.

24:44.320 --> 24:46.120
Gotta love it.

25:07.720 --> 25:09.520
Hold on, Aisha!

25:11.920 --> 25:14.320
One, two, three, four, five, six!

25:14.920 --> 25:16.720
Aisha!

25:18.520 --> 25:20.320
- You OK?
- They're tough.

25:20.320 --> 25:23.320
- Let's finish these purple parasites.
- You said it.

25:35.920 --> 25:37.720
I want you guys to meet Saba.

25:49.720 --> 25:50.320
ALL: Uh-oh!

25:52.720 --> 25:53.920
ALL: Yeah!

25:55.720 --> 25:57.520
TOMMY: Now let's go find lvan.

26:00.080 --> 26:03.080
KIMBERLY: Hey, what's happening?

26:04.880 --> 26:07.280
BILLY: We're losing power.

26:13.280 --> 26:15.680
- What's goin' on?
- Alpha, come in.

26:19.280 --> 26:22.880
- Something's wrong.
- We'd better get back. Let's go, guys.

26:31.880 --> 26:34.280
BILLY: Oh, no.

26:34.280 --> 26:36.080
- Ooze.
- TOMMY: Let's get it open.

26:45.080 --> 26:47.480
TOMMY: Look at this place.

26:47.480 --> 26:49.880
TOMMY: I can't believe it.

26:50.480 --> 26:52.880
AISHA: What happened here?

26:54.080 --> 26:55.880
KIMBERLY: Oh, no.

27:00.080 --> 27:01.280
ADAM: Zordon!

27:01.280 --> 27:04.280
What's happening to him?

27:04.280 --> 27:06.680
Outside of his time warp, he's dying.

27:07.880 --> 27:09.680
BILLY: He needs power.

27:11.480 --> 27:13.880
Rangers.

27:13.880 --> 27:16.280
Thank goodness you are safe.

27:16.880 --> 27:19.280
Come on, we gotta get you back inside.

27:20.480 --> 27:22.880
I'm afraid that is impossible.

27:24.080 --> 27:27.080
The power has been destroyed.

27:28.280 --> 27:30.680
It is gone.

27:30.680 --> 27:32.480
The Zords...

27:32.480 --> 27:34.280
the weapons...

27:34.880 --> 27:36.680
all of it.

27:36.680 --> 27:40.880
The Power Rangers are no more.

27:40.880 --> 27:43.280
Ivan Ooze has won.

27:43.280 --> 27:46.880
- We're losing him.
- Zordon, you can't leave us!

27:48.080 --> 27:52.880
Ever since you came into our lives,
you've been like a father to us all.

27:53.480 --> 27:57.080
You must be strong.

28:01.880 --> 28:03.680
Rangers!

28:03.680 --> 28:05.480
TOMMY: Alpha.

28:07.880 --> 28:09.680
- Are you OK?
- I'll be fine.

28:10.280 --> 28:13.280
There may be a power
that can save Zordon.

28:13.280 --> 28:16.880
- What power?
- It is on the distant planet of Phaedos.

28:16.880 --> 28:21.080
It's very dangerous.
All who have tried for it have perished.

28:21.080 --> 28:25.880
- But we have to try, Alpha.
- Zordon's life force will not last long.

28:25.880 --> 28:28.880
- You won't have much time.
- How can we get it?

28:28.880 --> 28:33.080
Maybe if I can download the last plasmatic
morphing gem into the transport core,

28:33.080 --> 28:36.080
I might have just enough power
to get you there.

28:36.080 --> 28:40.280
- But there won't be any left to get you back.
- So, how do we get back?

28:40.280 --> 28:43.280
We have to hope that the power is there.

28:44.480 --> 28:46.280
Zordon's life depends on it.

28:48.080 --> 28:49.880
- Are you ready?
- Yeah.

28:54.080 --> 28:57.080
We may not have our powers,
but we're still the Power Rangers.

28:57.680 --> 29:00.680
Remember, Rangers,
Zordon doesn't have much time.

29:15.080 --> 29:18.680
Oh, no! Aye-yai-yai-yai-yai!

29:18.680 --> 29:21.080
Please hold on, Zordon!

29:27.080 --> 29:30.680
I can't believe it! How could he
let them slip through his hands?!

29:30.680 --> 29:33.680
He's no better than the rest of the hired help!

29:33.680 --> 29:36.080
Oh, give it a rest.

29:39.680 --> 29:43.280
- Hi, honey, I'm home!
- You egg-sucking purple pinhead!

29:43.280 --> 29:45.680
The Rangers are going after the great power!

29:46.280 --> 29:49.280
I thought you said this guy
was the master of disaster!

29:49.280 --> 29:51.680
He's nothing but
a slime-infested jelly doughnut!

29:52.880 --> 29:55.280
Finally someone shut her up.

29:57.080 --> 29:59.480
Your feebleness is staggering.

29:59.480 --> 30:02.480
You obviously need a vacation.

30:02.480 --> 30:07.280
I think circumstances
force us to choose a new leader...

30:07.280 --> 30:10.280
and I pick... me!

30:13.280 --> 30:16.280
Who does this clown think he's dealing with?

30:16.280 --> 30:19.280
The bogeyman is taking over.

30:19.880 --> 30:23.480
No one double-crosses Lord Zedd and lives!

30:25.280 --> 30:28.280
Oh, stop it! It tickles!

30:30.680 --> 30:32.480
My turn.

30:39.080 --> 30:44.480
- RITA: (squeaky voice) Way to go, bonehead!
- ZEDD: You can't trust anyone in this galaxy!

30:44.480 --> 30:48.080
- I love snow globes.
- RITA: Earthquake! Earthquake!

30:48.080 --> 30:51.080
Now you have a choice. You either serve me...

30:51.080 --> 30:54.080
or you can join these
insufferable dingledorks!

30:54.080 --> 30:57.680
- Goldar, get us out of here!
- Don't listen to that purple booger!

30:57.680 --> 30:59.480
ZEDD: Don't you dare betray me!

31:00.080 --> 31:04.280
- We never liked those dingledorks.
- PIG: You said it. They stink.

31:04.280 --> 31:09.680
So... what are we going to do about
the Power Rangers, oh my hideous one?

31:10.280 --> 31:12.080
Ah, yes.

31:12.080 --> 31:14.480
The Power Rangers.

31:14.480 --> 31:15.680
( snorts )

31:24.680 --> 31:26.480
- Good distance.
- Yeah.

31:53.480 --> 31:54.680
( squawking )

31:57.680 --> 32:04.280
Shut your beaks! Now,
my Tengu Warriors, you will fly to Phaedos,

32:04.280 --> 32:08.480
you will find the Power Rangers
and you will tear them apart!

32:13.280 --> 32:16.280
- GOLDAR: Go sic 'em, Tweety!
- PIG: Happy hunting!

32:50.480 --> 32:51.680
Wow.

32:55.880 --> 32:58.880
My gosh. Look at this place.

32:58.880 --> 33:02.480
AISHA: You guys! Over here! Quick!

33:12.680 --> 33:15.680
AISHA: Whoa. Looks like
somebody had a bad day.

33:15.680 --> 33:19.880
- What is it?
- I think the question is "What was it?"

33:20.480 --> 33:23.480
Definitely not the welcoming committee,
that's for sure.

33:23.480 --> 33:25.880
Come on, guys, we got a job to do.

33:55.280 --> 33:58.280
Taking over the world is one thing.

33:58.280 --> 34:01.280
Finding good help to run it for you,
that's the killer.

34:01.280 --> 34:04.280
Would you like me to make a few calls?

34:04.880 --> 34:09.679
No need. I'm going to recruit
the parents of Angel Grove.

34:09.679 --> 34:13.880
No offence, boss,
but they might find you a little disgusting.

34:13.880 --> 34:15.080
( belches )

34:15.080 --> 34:18.080
Well, I suppose you'd be the experts on that.

34:18.679 --> 34:23.480
- You forget. I'm a master of disguise.
- How could I forget? I never knew.

34:24.080 --> 34:26.480
First I'll turn them into zombies

34:26.480 --> 34:30.080
and then order them
to dig up my Ecto-Morphicons.

34:30.080 --> 34:31.880
How you gonna do that?

34:32.480 --> 34:37.880
By showing them the wonders
of being wicked with a little bit of lvan's ooze.

34:39.679 --> 34:41.480
( laughs )

34:45.080 --> 34:46.280
Ooh!

34:51.679 --> 34:57.080
Finally I get to finish
what I started 6,000 years ago!

34:57.080 --> 35:01.880
Little do they know my weapons of
destruction lie buried beneath their feet.

35:03.680 --> 35:05.480
( all laugh )

35:06.680 --> 35:10.880
- Stop it! Get to work!
- PIG: Yes, Your Royal Heinous Highness.

35:30.680 --> 35:32.480
Hey.

35:33.080 --> 35:33.920
You OK?

35:35.480 --> 35:37.880
I was just thinking about Zordon.

35:39.080 --> 35:42.680
You know, everything
we've been through together.

35:43.280 --> 35:45.680
Look, he's gonna make it.

35:46.880 --> 35:48.680
We'll find this power

35:49.280 --> 35:54.080
and then send that slimeball lvan Ooze
back to the sewer he crawled out of.

35:54.080 --> 35:55.880
Come on.

35:58.280 --> 36:00.080
What the heck was that?

36:01.880 --> 36:03.680
BILLY: Get down!

36:08.480 --> 36:09.680
TOMMY: Let's move!

36:12.680 --> 36:13.880
ROCKY: Look out!

36:19.280 --> 36:21.080
They're everywhere!

36:21.080 --> 36:22.880
Take cover!

36:30.080 --> 36:31.880
Back off.

36:42.080 --> 36:45.080
- Know the funny thing about morphin'?
- What?

36:45.080 --> 36:47.480
You don't appreciate it till you can't do it!

36:52.880 --> 36:55.280
TOMMY: Kimberly, behind you!

36:58.880 --> 37:01.280
Hang on, Kimberly!

37:03.680 --> 37:05.480
Somebody help me!

37:06.680 --> 37:09.080
- They're too strong!
- We need our powers!

37:13.280 --> 37:15.840
Let me go, Big Bird!

37:39.840 --> 37:41.640
( whistling noise )

37:44.640 --> 37:47.040
( whistling noise continues )

38:13.440 --> 38:15.840
That was amazing. Thanks.

38:17.640 --> 38:21.840
If you want to thank me,
go back to wherever it is you came from.

38:22.440 --> 38:24.840
- We can't.
- We were told there was a great power here.

38:24.840 --> 38:27.240
- Is it true?
- Yes.

38:27.240 --> 38:32.040
The ground is littered with the bones
of those who have tried for it and failed.

38:34.440 --> 38:37.440
Well, we're different. We won't fail.

38:41.640 --> 38:44.640
Leave Phaedos... before it's too late.

38:46.440 --> 38:49.440
Look, we don't want any trouble.
Our leader Zordon got hurt...

38:50.040 --> 38:51.240
Zordon?

38:51.840 --> 38:53.640
Did you say Zordon?

38:54.240 --> 38:56.640
You know Zordon? Who are you?

39:01.440 --> 39:05.640
I am Dulcea, master warrior
of the planet Phaedos.

39:06.840 --> 39:08.640
What has happened to Zordon?

39:08.640 --> 39:11.640
He was attacked by
this cosmic being named lvan Ooze.

39:11.640 --> 39:14.640
- lvan Ooze is free?
- You've heard of him?

39:15.240 --> 39:17.040
Ivan Ooze is a monster.

39:17.640 --> 39:20.640
If we don't hurry, your planet is doomed.

39:20.640 --> 39:22.440
Follow me.

39:41.640 --> 39:45.240
Alpha, I am deeply concerned
about the Rangers.

39:45.240 --> 39:47.640
Please, Zordon, save your strength.

39:47.640 --> 39:50.040
You need to rest.

39:50.040 --> 39:54.840
We must try to communicate with them.
It is possible I can help them.

39:54.840 --> 40:00.240
If I could locate a vertical deflector, we could
make contact through the viewing globe.

40:00.840 --> 40:03.840
Please... please hurry.

40:03.840 --> 40:06.240
Aye-yai-yai-yai-yai! Hold on.

40:07.440 --> 40:11.640
Guys and girls, girls and guys,
gather round and feast your eyes.

40:11.640 --> 40:14.040
I promise you all, you just can't lose,

40:14.640 --> 40:17.040
when you've got
your own supply of lvan's ooze.

40:17.040 --> 40:21.240
- BOY: What are we supposed to do with it?
- Show it to parents, show it to friends.

40:21.240 --> 40:24.240
When you've got your ooze,
the fun never ends.

40:24.240 --> 40:26.040
This is kinda gross.

40:26.040 --> 40:29.040
You may have heard
that looks can be deceiving.

40:29.040 --> 40:32.040
I'm sure that when you've tried it,
you all will be believing.

40:32.040 --> 40:34.440
And did I mention it's free?

40:34.440 --> 40:36.840
- I'll take some.
- Here you go. Who else?

40:39.240 --> 40:43.440
OK, there's enough for everybody.
Take it home in boxes, take it home in cases.

40:43.440 --> 40:47.640
If your parents try to stop you,
just throw it in their faces!

40:55.440 --> 40:57.840
BILLY: Dulcea, where are you taking us?

40:57.840 --> 41:00.840
You shall know soon enough.

41:00.840 --> 41:04.440
KIMBERLY: We have to hurry.
Zordon won't last much longer.

41:17.640 --> 41:18.840
TOMMY: Wow.

41:19.440 --> 41:21.840
- AISHA: Amazing.
- TOMMY: What is this place?

41:21.840 --> 41:26.040
DULCEA: These are the ancient ruins
of the Ninjetti Temple.

41:29.640 --> 41:33.240
There, beyond the Niola Jungle,
is the monolith.

41:33.840 --> 41:36.840
Inside awaits the power of the universe.

41:36.840 --> 41:40.440
The monolith
is heavily guarded against intruders.

41:40.440 --> 41:44.640
No one has ever survived
an attempt to reach it.

41:44.640 --> 41:47.040
Then how can we?

41:47.040 --> 41:49.440
You were chosen by Zordon.

41:50.040 --> 41:53.040
I have faith in his wisdom.

41:53.040 --> 41:55.440
Can you help us?

41:56.640 --> 42:00.840
We will call upon
the sacred animals of the Ninjetti for help.

42:19.400 --> 42:20.600
Fred!

42:59.600 --> 43:02.600
There, that should do it. Let's give it a whirl!

43:03.200 --> 43:07.400
Police have been fielding
hundreds of calls from concerned citizens

43:07.400 --> 43:10.400
as the number of missing parents
continues to grow.

43:11.000 --> 43:14.600
Hi, folks. Ivan Ooze here.
Are you bored with your work?

43:14.600 --> 43:19.400
Are you bored with your life? Then come on
down to Ooze City and let"s get sticky!

43:20.000 --> 43:21.800
Aye-yai-yai-yai-yai!

43:21.800 --> 43:24.200
Ivan's evil plot is taking shape.

43:27.200 --> 43:29.520
I just hope they're not too late.

43:51.040 --> 43:56.440
Buried deep within each of us
is an animal spirit waiting to be released.

43:57.640 --> 44:00.640
Close your eyes and look deep inside.

44:54.040 --> 44:58.840
Aisha, you are the bear,
fierce and unstoppable.

45:01.840 --> 45:06.040
Rocky, powerful, smart,
you are the mighty ape.

45:09.040 --> 45:13.840
Billy, you are the wolf, cunning and swift.

45:16.840 --> 45:22.240
Agile Kimberly, light as a feather,
you are the crane.

45:25.240 --> 45:26.080
Adam...

45:27.640 --> 45:30.640
- Adam, what's wrong?
- I'm a frog.

45:32.440 --> 45:36.640
Yes, a frog. Like the one you kiss...
to get a handsome prince.

45:40.840 --> 45:45.040
And you, Tommy, are the falcon,
winged lord of the skies.

45:48.040 --> 45:53.440
To be in harmony with a sacred animal
spirit is to have the force of the Ninjetti.

45:54.640 --> 45:58.840
To those who are Ninjetti,
anything is possible.

46:01.840 --> 46:05.440
But... I am afraid
you must do this on you own.

46:07.240 --> 46:09.640
You're not coming with us, Dulcea?

46:10.840 --> 46:12.640
If only I could.

46:12.640 --> 46:18.640
One step beyond this plateau and I would
begin to age as rapidly as Zordon is now.

46:19.840 --> 46:24.040
The strength is inside you. Trust it.

46:24.040 --> 46:26.440
Your sacred animals will be your guide.

46:30.040 --> 46:33.040
May your animal spirits watch over you.

46:48.040 --> 46:49.040
Dad?

46:52.840 --> 46:54.040
Dad?

46:56.440 --> 46:58.840
Dad? Where are you?

47:01.240 --> 47:04.240
IVAN: I forgot how slow parents are.

47:04.240 --> 47:07.840
I thought my Ecto-Morphicons
would be dug up by now.

47:10.240 --> 47:12.640
Oh, Goldie, I'm bored.

47:13.840 --> 47:15.640
Let's have some fun. Hey, you!

47:17.440 --> 47:19.240
Dance.

47:19.240 --> 47:21.040
( rock and roll music )

47:23.440 --> 47:25.240
Do the swim.

47:30.640 --> 47:33.040
- Ballet!
- (ballet music)

47:35.440 --> 47:37.840
( Ivan and Goldar laugh )

47:41.440 --> 47:42.040
Hey.

47:42.040 --> 47:45.040
Hey, boss! They're back!

47:47.440 --> 47:48.640
Ah!

47:49.240 --> 47:50.440
My Tengu.

47:57.640 --> 47:59.440
(squawking)

47:59.440 --> 48:02.440
Stop your screeching.

48:04.240 --> 48:07.840
- How did you fare?
- It couldn't have gone better.

48:07.840 --> 48:10.840
Threw one of 'em off a mountain,
one into a ragin' river.

48:11.440 --> 48:13.840
So, they've all been destroyed?

48:14.440 --> 48:16.840
- Well, we were about to destroy them, but...
- What?

48:17.440 --> 48:21.640
You didn't kill them? You call yourself Tengu
warriors? You're more like Tengu turkeys!

48:21.640 --> 48:24.640
I'll have you all stuffed and roasted!

48:24.640 --> 48:29.440
But, master, there was this monster with
these huge sticks and it kept twirling them...

48:29.440 --> 48:33.640
Sticks? Did these sticks
have a whistling sound?

48:34.240 --> 48:37.240
It was more like nails on a chalkboard.

48:37.240 --> 48:39.040
Dulcea.

48:39.040 --> 48:43.840
That miserable, manipulating,
loathsome she-devil of a witch!

48:43.840 --> 48:46.840
If she leads them to the great power,
everything will be ruined.

48:46.840 --> 48:51.640
- Do you want us to take another whack at it?
- How about takin' another quack at it?

48:55.240 --> 49:00.040
No time to waste. My Ecto-Morphicon
machines must be unearthed by sundown.

49:30.040 --> 49:32.440
It's time.

50:01.840 --> 50:05.440
BILLY: Man, this jungle goes on for ever.

50:05.440 --> 50:09.640
TOMMY: We've gotta keep movin', guys.
Zordon's time is runnin' out.

50:31.400 --> 50:32.600
Dad!

50:35.000 --> 50:36.200
Dad!

50:36.800 --> 50:38.600
Hey, Dad!

50:39.200 --> 50:41.600
Dad, what's wrong with you?

50:41.600 --> 50:45.800
It's me - Fred.
Dad, we gotta get outta here!

50:45.800 --> 50:47.600
Hey, you!

50:49.400 --> 50:51.200
Get back to work!

50:51.200 --> 50:55.400
PIG: Yeah! Pick up those rocks!
Tote that barge! Lift that bale!

50:56.600 --> 50:59.000
GOLDAR: Put your weak backs into it!

50:59.000 --> 51:02.000
PIG: Yeah, I had a weak back
about a week back.

51:06.200 --> 51:12.800
Feast your eyes on the exoskeleton
of the Barbaric Hornitor!

51:12.800 --> 51:15.800
The Dreaded Scorpitron
should be close by.

51:15.800 --> 51:19.400
Once my lovely little Ecto-Morphicon
machines are up and running,

51:20.000 --> 51:23.000
spreading ooze throughout the world,

51:23.000 --> 51:27.800
I shall annihilate Angel Grove,
and then... the universe!

51:29.000 --> 51:33.200
PIG: # We're takin' over the world!
We're takin' over the world #

51:48.200 --> 51:52.400
- AISHA: What is this place?
- BILLY: Looks like some kind of graveyard.

51:56.000 --> 52:01.400
- KIMBERLY: I wonder what happened.
- ADAM: Personally, I'd rather not find out.

52:05.600 --> 52:08.600
- Welcome to Jurassic Park.
- AISHA: Very funny, Adam.

52:38.600 --> 52:40.400
TOMMY: Aisha, get outta there!

52:51.200 --> 52:53.000
Rocky!

52:59.000 --> 53:00.200
Uh-oh.

53:04.400 --> 53:06.200
Wait for me!

53:14.600 --> 53:16.400
- Tommy!
- Hang on!

53:17.600 --> 53:18.800
Tommy!

53:20.600 --> 53:23.000
All right, bonehead!

53:36.200 --> 53:38.600
- Tommy, hang on!
- Whoa! Whoa!

53:40.400 --> 53:42.200
Tommy!

53:44.000 --> 53:45.200
Whoa!

53:48.800 --> 53:51.200
Hold on tight, Tommy!

53:57.200 --> 54:00.800
Yo, fossil head!
I've got a bone to pick with you!

54:03.800 --> 54:05.600
Huh? Whoa!

54:09.200 --> 54:11.000
Are you OK?

54:11.000 --> 54:15.200
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Biology finally paid off for you, huh?

54:15.200 --> 54:18.200
We should get outta here
before he pulls himself together.

54:18.800 --> 54:20.000
Yeah.

54:35.560 --> 54:41.560
GOLDAR: You there! Let's show a little
initiative! And you, get your rear in gear!

54:49.960 --> 54:52.960
Pick up the pace! We haven't got all day!

54:53.560 --> 54:57.760
- Hey, boss, construction is completed.
- PIG: Yeah, when's lunch?

54:57.760 --> 55:00.760
Parents of Angel Grove!

55:01.360 --> 55:04.360
You have completed my Ecto-Morphicons!

55:04.960 --> 55:09.760
But, frankly, I'm sick of your ugly faces
and your dull personalities.

55:09.760 --> 55:11.560
- Yeah!
- (giggles/snorts)

55:11.560 --> 55:15.160
You will return to the construction site
and leap to your doom.

55:15.160 --> 55:16.960
- Leap to your doom.
- Bye-bye.

55:17.560 --> 55:19.960
- GOLDAR: Bye-bye!
- GOLDAR: Aloha!

55:19.960 --> 55:21.760
GOLDAR: Arrivederci!

55:22.360 --> 55:24.160
- Dad!
- IVAN: Hasta la vista, baby.

55:24.160 --> 55:26.560
GOLDAR: See ya! Wouldn't wanna be ya!

55:26.560 --> 55:27.760
Ciao.

55:29.560 --> 55:31.960
See ya later, alligator.

55:31.960 --> 55:36.160
Finally, the moment of truth!

55:37.360 --> 55:40.360
Mordant, let the ooze flow!

55:40.360 --> 55:42.760
Comin' right up.

55:52.960 --> 55:57.160
Ooze, give my creatures life!

55:57.160 --> 56:01.360
Life, I tell you! Life!

56:18.160 --> 56:19.360
Excellent!

56:27.160 --> 56:29.560
Now my machines will destroy the city!

56:49.520 --> 56:50.720
ADAM: Wow.

56:50.720 --> 56:53.120
Hey, guys, check this out.

57:01.520 --> 57:03.320
BILLY: lncredible.

57:14.120 --> 57:16.520
Let's go, guys. Nice and easy.

57:48.920 --> 57:50.120
What do you think?

57:50.720 --> 57:52.520
Wait here.

58:13.520 --> 58:14.720
Tommy!

58:40.520 --> 58:42.320
- What now?
- Ninjetti!

58:42.320 --> 58:44.120
- Falcon!
- The frog!

58:44.120 --> 58:45.920
- The ape!
- The crane!

58:45.920 --> 58:48.320
- The wolf!
- Bear!

58:53.120 --> 58:54.920
These things are made of rock.

59:00.920 --> 59:02.720
These guys are strong.

59:20.720 --> 59:21.920
Yikes.

59:30.920 --> 59:32.720
Back off, boulder breath!

59:53.120 --> 59:54.920
Hang tight, Adam!

59:58.520 --> 59:59.720
Ever play leapfrog?

01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:06.320
- Adam!
- Hang on, Rocky!

01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:12.920
Hey, lava head!

01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:20.720
Thanks, Adam. Thought I was finished.

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:23.720
That's one down, and three to go.

01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:32.720
Whoa!

01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:35.720
Somebody help!

01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:41.720
Let's talk about this.

01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:44.120
Guess not.

01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:48.920
Come on, roll!

01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:50.720
Hang on, Kimberly!

01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:58.520
They're strong, but they're not too smart.
Help me push.

01:00:58.520 --> 01:00:59.720
Right.

01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:03.320
KIMBERLY: Let's rock his world.

01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:24.920
What is this, pick-on-the-frog day?

01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:32.120
- Hey, Adam, could you use a hand?
- The thought crossed my mind.

01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:32.720
Adam!

01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:38.720
Elevator goin' up.

01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:42.320
BILLY: Elevator goin' down.

01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:45.320
Talk about a splitting headache.

01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:50.120
Whoa! That was close.

01:01:57.320 --> 01:01:59.120
- All right. Ready?
- Yeah.

01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:00.920
Go!

01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:07.520
Ninjetti corkscrew kick!

01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:14.720
Eightball, corner pocket!

01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:27.920
What now?

01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:30.920
- Whoa. What's happening?
- TOMMY: Look.

01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:17.240
The great power.

01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:19.640
The sacred animals.

01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:50.240
ROCKY: New Zords!

01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:09.440
- We did it!
- Our morphers are on line.

01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:11.240
- We got the power!
- Hang on, Zordon!

01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:13.640
- We're on our way.
- Let's do it.

01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:27.440
DULCEA: Good luck, Rangers.

01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:46.040
Citizens of Angel Grove,
how do you like my friends, huh?

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:13.640
The boys are back in town!

01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:16.760
Long live the King of Ooze!

01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:21.480
The mayor has declared a state of emergency.

01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:25.080
He"s asked that the city
be immediately evacuated.

01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:27.480
Angel Grove has never before known...

01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:31.680
Aye-yai-yai-yai-yai! Ivan's evil machines
are destroying Angel Grove!

01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:34.080
Alpha...

01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:36.480
keep trying.

01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:38.880
TV: Where are the Power Rangers?

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:46.080
I love the smell of destruction in the evening.

01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:47.880
Me, too.

01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:49.680
What's that smell?

01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:53.280
Inconceivable.

01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:56.280
The Power Rangers!

01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:05.280
- Oh, man! Look at this mess.
- This is lvan's handiwork.

01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:08.280
- Let's get back to the command centre.
- Wait. What was that?

01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:10.680
I think we're about to find out. Look!

01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:20.280
- Whoa. What is that thing?
- lvan's been busy while we were away.

01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:25.080
Whoa!

01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:30.480
- What's that?
- AISHA: There's another one.

01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:32.880
KIMBERLY: And it's even uglier.

01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:37.080
- Whoa.
- We've gotta stop these things.

01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:40.680
- We've got new Ninja Zords. Let's use 'em!
- Right!

01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:42.480
Ninja crane Zord!

01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:44.280
Ninja wolf Zord!

01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:45.480
Ninja frog Zord!

01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:46.680
Ninja ape Zord!

01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:49.680
Ninja bear Zord!

01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:51.480
Ninja falcon Zord!

01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:55.680
GOLDAR: Uh-oh!

01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:05.280
- Check it out!
- Ninja Zords!

01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:06.480
Cool!

01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:07.680
- Yes!
- Awesome!

01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:16.680
Oh, no! It's the Zords!

01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:20.280
Ah, Zords, schmords.
I'll crush 'em like roaches.

01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:23.280
- Let's do it!
- Right! Ninja Zords power up!

01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:31.680
Ready to ride. Yes!

01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:35.280
- All systems on line.
- Activating weapon systems.

01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:37.680
- Nice stereo.
- We're outta here!

01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:53.880
(parents chanting) Leap to our doom.

01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:56.280
Leap to our doom.

01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:59.280
Leap to our doom.

01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:03.480
# Uh-oh, we're in trouble #

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:06.480
# Something's come along
and it's burst our bubble #

01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:08.280
# Yeah, yeah #

01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:18.479
Hey, everyone!

01:08:23.279 --> 01:08:28.080
Listen up! You all think
this is one big party, don't you?

01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:31.680
- Yeah!
- Well, you've all been brainwashed.

01:08:32.279 --> 01:08:36.479
Ivan's taking over the planet
and he's using all of us in his plans!

01:08:36.479 --> 01:08:39.479
- And he's got our parents.
- What are you talking about?

01:08:39.479 --> 01:08:41.880
Look, lvan Ooze is evil.

01:08:41.880 --> 01:08:47.279
And if you don't come with me right now, our
parents are gonna die! You gotta believe me!

01:08:50.279 --> 01:08:54.479
TOMMY: Rangers, I'm over the east quadrant.
My sensors are pickin' up a disturbance.

01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:56.880
I'm goin' in.

01:08:57.479 --> 01:09:00.479
Somebody call for an exterminator?
I've got a lock.

01:09:03.479 --> 01:09:05.279
Rockets away!

01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:15.479
I've been hit! I'm pullin' out!

01:09:15.479 --> 01:09:18.479
Don't worry, Tommy, Frog Zord is in position.

01:09:20.279 --> 01:09:22.080
We got 'em now, boss.

01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:25.680
Touch me again,
you'll be chicken wings in the morning.

01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:31.680
ADAM: Tongue-tied and twisted.

01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:33.479
Yee-hah!

01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:40.080
Bad move, sparky.
You play with fire, you're gonna get burned.

01:09:45.479 --> 01:09:47.880
- I need backup!
- BILLY: l"m on my way!

01:09:50.279 --> 01:09:53.279
Wolf Zord approaching target.
Keep him tied up. I'm loading hydraulics.

01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:56.280
ADAM: I'm losin' him!

01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:58.080
Here goes!

01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:01.680
All right! Got him.

01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:10.680
Time to boogie with the bear.

01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:15.480
Whoa!

01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:17.880
I've been hit hard!

01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:22.080
Ape Zord locked on target.

01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:25.680
Yee-hah!

01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:28.080
Ride 'em, cowboy!

01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:35.280
- Hang in there, Rocky!
- I'm hangin'! I'm hangin'!

01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:39.480
FRED: Come on! We'll take the monorail!

01:10:43.080 --> 01:10:45.480
Let's get down to the construction site!

01:10:57.480 --> 01:11:01.080
All right, guys,
I've got a lock on the ooze man.

01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:02.880
Ah!

01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:05.880
Here comes that cute
little Pink Ranger to the rescue.

01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:09.480
Oh, you think she's cute too, huh?

01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:11.280
(lvan growls)

01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:15.480
- One order of toasted slime comin' up.
- So, you wanna play, huh?

01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:23.880
Ivan's got me in an electromagnetic deadlock!
I can't break free!

01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:26.280
TOMMY: Hang on, Kimberly!

01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:30.480
I'm getting airsick up here!

01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:34.080
My stabilisers have ruptured!
I can't hold on much longer!

01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:39.480
- I'm burning up in here!
- AISHA: Kimberly, use your thrusters!

01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:41.880
Right! Now, which button?

01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:44.880
Aaaaaggghhh!

01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:48.480
- I'll deal with you later.
- Yeah, later.

01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:58.080
Ah. Oozed.

01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:04.080
I'm losing my grip!
I can't hold on much longer!

01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:10.680
Falcon Zord is back in the game.
Adam, disengage. I've got a clear shot!

01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:12.480
He's all yours.

01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:16.080
All right, big guy, it's lights out for you.

01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:19.680
Rockets away!

01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:31.680
- He's outta there!
- Target neutralised. Let's get the other one.

01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:35.880
He's too strong! I can't take him down!

01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:47.880
Everybody close in. This street's a dead end.

01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:52.080
IVAN: They've destroyed
my beautiful creation.

01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:59.880
Now I'm beginning to get really angry!

01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:14.880
Oh, I'm gonna be sick.

01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:16.680
IVAN: I feel big again!

01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:19.680
Go get 'em, booger man!

01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:26.280
Whoa. Somebody call a plastic surgeon.

01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:31.080
Oh, no!

01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:32.880
I'm outta here!

01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:39.480
Time for a little swordplay.

01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:47.640
- He destroyed the monorail track.
- We need Ninja Megazord power now!

01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:50.640
Ninja Megazord, power up!

01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:04.440
Monorail's in trouble.
I'll complete docking sequence later.

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:06.840
KIMBERLY: We"ll take care of lvan.

01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:13.440
# Go, go, Power Rangers #

01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:16.440
# Mighty Morphin Power Rangers #

01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:18.240
Crane Zord locked on.

01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:20.040
Checking out.

01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:22.440
Ninja battle mode now!

01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:29.640
- Activating Ninja Megazord battle mode.
- Power Sword, now!

01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:35.040
Shall we tango?

01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:43.440
- Oh, no.
- What is that?

01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:45.840
- The track's broken!
- Oh, no!

01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:50.640
Hang on, kids.

01:14:56.640 --> 01:15:00.240
- Falcon Zord is comin' in for a landin'.
- Everybody hang on!

01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:06.240
All right! Yeah! Whoo!

01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:09.840
Good luck, kids.

01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:17.640
Power Sword has been destroyed.

01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:23.640
- Pressure's dropping!
- Negative control!

01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:27.840
- Tommy, we need your help!
- Hang tight, guys. I'm on my way.

01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:34.440
- Everybody hang on!
- IVAN: Next stop, Angel Grove First National.

01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:35.640
Whoaaa!

01:15:35.640 --> 01:15:37.440
ADAM: Brace for impact!

01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:46.440
- All systems down!
- He's closing in!

01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:50.640
- Tommy, get your butt down here!
- Comin' in to complete the sequence.

01:15:56.040 --> 01:15:57.240
Ninja Falcon Megazord!

01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:03.240
Let's get Ooze outta here
before he destroys everything.

01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:05.640
- I'll set a course for outer space.
- Good idea.

01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:06.840
Let's do it!

01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:17.640
You can run, but you can't hide.

01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:20.640
Yee-hah!

01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:31.280
(chanting) Leap to our doom.

01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:35.480
Leap to our doom.

01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:38.480
Leap to our doom.

01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:41.480
Leap to our doom.

01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:49.280
It's our parents!

01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:04.880
You guys try and stop them.
And you two come with me.

01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:22.280
- Guys, I think I know a way to get rid of lvan.
- Really? How?

01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:24.680
- Ryan's Comet.
- Billy, that's brilliant!

01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:27.080
- What?
- We get lvan in the comet's path...

01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:29.480
And kaboom! He's space dust.

01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:31.880
- All right, guys, main thrusters.
- Right!

01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:44.480
- We can't hold 'em back!
- We have to keep on trying!

01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:04.880
Turn it on!

01:18:27.080 --> 01:18:30.080
Well, if it isn't that
double-dealing dough head!

01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:34.280
I hope those Rangers
put that lousy lowlife out of my misery!

01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:37.880
- Go, Rangers! Go, Rangers!
- Go, Rangers! Go, Rangers!

01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:41.480
We're approaching the comet's coordinates.

01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:45.080
All right, guys, this is it.
We'll wait here and lure him in.

01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:48.080
I'm gonna rip you apart Zord by Zord.

01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:51.680
TOMMY: Here he comes. Brace yourselves!

01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:54.680
(lvan laughs)

01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:02.480
- Micropressure's in the red!
- We're imploding!

01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:05.480
Bearing 009. We're in the comet's trajectory.

01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:06.680
We need to break free.

01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:09.680
IVAN: Have you hugged your Zords today?

01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:15.680
- Here it comes!
- We have to break his grip!

01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:18.680
Desperate times
call for desperate measures.

01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:22.280
- What are you doing?
- Taking care of business.

01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:28.880
- We're outta here.
- Right!

01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:35.480
Oh, no.

01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:00.080
Yeah.

01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:02.480
- Skull!
- Bulk...

01:20:09.080 --> 01:20:10.280
Dad!

01:20:11.480 --> 01:20:13.280
- Fred!
- Dad!

01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:24.680
I love you, son.

01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:34.520
Alpha!

01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:37.520
Rangers, you made it!

01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:41.120
But... I'm afraid you're too late.

01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:43.520
BILLY: Too late?

01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:49.520
This can't be happening.

01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:18.320
Remember what we learnt?

01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:23.720
To those who possess the great power,
all things are possible.

01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:32.120
Come on.

01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:45.320
Zordon!

01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:47.120
Rangers!

01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:50.120
He's alive! He's alive! He's alive!

01:22:50.120 --> 01:22:54.320
- We thought that you had...
- It is good to see you again, too.

01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:03.600
( # The Power" by Snap )

01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:06.000
- SKULL: We were awesome.
- BULK: lncredible!

01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:09.000
Ivan and his 50-foot monsters
had us surrounded.

01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:12.600
- There was no escape.
- We knew we were facing death in the eye.

01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:16.200
- We could smell death's breath.
- And death could use a mint.

01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:18.000
Can you believe those guys?

01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:21.000
I'm so hungry.

01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:23.400
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Fred!

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:27.600
- Hey! Rumour has it you're quite the hero.
- That's my man!

01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:31.200
I helped a bit.
The Power Rangers did most of the work.

01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:36.000
Hey, things got tough, you didn't panic.
You, my friend, demonstrated true bravery.

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:40.200
It's like what you taught me about martial
arts: use your head, and above all, stay calm.

01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:43.800
I heard you're in line to be
a Ranger yourself one of these days.

01:23:43.800 --> 01:23:48.600
- Nah, that's impossible.
- Hey, anything's possible.

01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:51.600
- You really think so?
- I know so.

01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:58.200
- Fred Kelman, the Silver Ranger.
- It does have a certain ring to it.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.400
Fred Kelman the Gold Ranger.

01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:07.800
Check it out!

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:12.000
# We'll get higher and higher #

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:13.800
# Straight up we'll climb #

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:18.000
# We'll get higher and higher #

01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:21.000
# Leave it all behind #

01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:26.400
# So, baby, dry your eyes #

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.400
