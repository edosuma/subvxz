00:00.533 --> 00:03.053
Hey, I've gained a lot
of ground in the polls. That's good news.

00:03.082 --> 00:04.895
Yeah, I have you down
only four points,

00:05.015 --> 00:06.816
but they're running a ton
of new negative ads.

00:06.885 --> 00:08.433
Maybe you should fight back.

00:08.467 --> 00:09.768
Ben, your heart's
in the right place.

00:09.802 --> 00:11.102
Your heart and your butt.

00:11.137 --> 00:12.621
I will not go negative.

00:12.655 --> 00:13.905
Crap on a turd!

00:13.939 --> 00:16.041
Care for a "Recall Knope"
gift bag?

00:16.075 --> 00:18.610
The committee to recall
Leslie Knope is relentless.

00:18.644 --> 00:21.163
Look what they're handing out
at elementary schools.

00:21.214 --> 00:22.614
[Recorded voice]
I'm Leslie Knope.

00:22.632 --> 00:23.832
Tell your parents to recall me.

00:23.850 --> 00:31.573
[Extensive flatulence]

00:31.607 --> 00:33.758
We all know that I cannot
spend as much money on ads

00:33.793 --> 00:37.662
as my opponent, but I printed
out 10,000 "Don't" stickers

00:37.697 --> 00:40.465
and 10,000 question mark
stickers.

00:40.499 --> 00:44.002
That way, if you see a sign
and it says "Recall Knope,"

00:44.036 --> 00:45.954
all you need to do is add
the question mark

00:46.005 --> 00:47.505
and the "Don't,"
and suddenly, it reads,

00:47.523 --> 00:49.624
"Recall Knope?
Don't."

00:49.659 --> 00:50.792
Why don't you
just put the "Don't"

00:50.826 --> 00:52.160
in front of "Recall Knope"?

00:53.763 --> 00:55.564
Yep, that's a much better idea.

00:55.598 --> 00:56.565
Can I have these
question mark stickers?

00:56.616 --> 00:57.615
Why?

00:57.633 --> 00:58.667
I want to put them
on stop signs.

00:58.718 --> 00:59.834

Hi. Um, I need to talk to
somebody about reserving a park.

01:24.660 --> 01:26.244
Oh, we have a new policy.

01:26.279 --> 01:28.346
Parks can only be reserved
for witch covens

01:28.381 --> 01:30.098
or slip-and-slide
competitions.

01:30.149 --> 01:31.132

Uh,

01:32.401 --> 01:34.118
- Seriously?
- No.

01:34.136 --> 01:36.271
Why would you even compete
in something like that?

01:36.305 --> 01:37.656
It doesn't matter.

01:37.690 --> 01:39.574
Um, I called earlier about
the free vaccinations thing.

01:39.625 --> 01:42.594
We're hoping to set up
a mobile hospital

01:42.628 --> 01:44.629

I'm sorry, is there
something wrong with him?

Tom, this witch wants to
reserve a park

01:49.819 --> 01:50.769

to say,

will go to the government.

you speak of?

formally submit Bill 68-J,

may have accidentally

way worse.

we deleted the tweet,

04:54.804 --> 04:56.087

it's you,

by filling out this form,

listing your assets
and liabilities.

07:18.429 --> 07:20.013
Nice try.

07:20.047 --> 07:22.165
I'm not telling you
how much money I have,

07:22.199 --> 07:24.467
where it's hidden,
or which precious metals

07:24.501 --> 07:27.954
and/or gemstones it may
or may not take the form of.

07:27.988 --> 07:29.122
If you don't give me
the information I need,

07:29.156 --> 07:30.156
there's nothing I can do.

07:30.190 --> 07:31.391
Oh, come on, Trevor.

07:31.425 --> 07:34.610

there's a way.

07:34.662 --> 07:36.879

one last time, Wyatt.

at the door.

07:41.902 --> 07:43.886
All right, let's begin.

07:43.937 --> 07:45.972
These hearings have two goals.

07:46.006 --> 07:49.125
One, to find out exactly
how this offensive tweet

07:49.176 --> 07:50.343
came to be sent.

07:50.377 --> 07:52.145
And two,
to turn this whole thing

07:52.179 --> 07:53.379
into a media circus.

07:53.397 --> 07:54.947
Ms. Knope, do you have
a statement?

quite simple.

employee forgot to log out

07:59.920 --> 08:01.360
of the Parks and Rec
Twitter account,

08:01.905 --> 08:05.591
they posted a personal, of the Parks 
and Rec private message by accident,

08:05.626 --> 08:07.310
and, uh, that person
is very sorry,

08:07.344 --> 08:08.444
and it won't happen again.

08:08.495 --> 08:10.029
Stop stonewalling

08:10.064 --> 08:11.414
and tell us what happened here!

08:11.465 --> 08:13.049
I just told you what happened.

08:13.100 --> 08:15.151
It was an unfortunate mistake.

08:15.185 --> 08:17.553
Okay, sadly,
due to your "intracksidence"--

08:17.588 --> 08:18.588
Not a word.

08:18.639 --> 08:20.139
We may never find out
what happened.

08:20.174 --> 08:23.275
When this sick, depraved tweet
first came to light,

08:23.293 --> 08:26.512
you said, "The account
was probably hacked

08:26.547 --> 08:28.564
by some bored teenager."

08:28.615 --> 08:31.784
Now you're saying
it's an unfortunate mistake.

08:31.818 --> 08:33.251
Why do you keep
flip-flopping?

08:33.285 --> 08:35.722
Well, because I learned
new information.

08:35.756 --> 08:37.924
When I was four,
I thought that chocolate milk

08:37.957 --> 08:39.542
came from brown cows,

08:39.592 --> 08:42.445
and then I flip-flopped
when I found out

08:42.479 --> 08:44.914
that there was something
called chocolate syrup.

08:44.948 --> 08:46.549
I don't think I'm
out of line when I say

08:46.583 --> 08:50.403
that this scandal makes Benghazi
look like whitewater!

08:50.437 --> 08:51.738
It's utterly meaningless.

08:51.772 --> 08:54.340
I think we need to hear
from the unnamed employee

08:54.374 --> 08:55.425
behind the tweet.

08:55.476 --> 08:57.744
- Perhaps he or she--
- Or them.

08:57.778 --> 09:00.079
It could be a bunch
of hot ladies.

09:00.113 --> 09:01.431
Yes, perhaps "them"

09:01.465 --> 09:04.834
can finally give us
the answers we need.

09:04.868 --> 09:07.720
What, what, what?
There she is.

09:07.754 --> 09:09.305
Nadia, I didn't know
what you wanted,

09:09.356 --> 09:11.190
so I got you a cappuccino,
a latte,

09:11.208 --> 09:14.594
four bags of coffee beans,
and a mini espresso machine.

09:14.628 --> 09:16.729
What happened to your accent?

09:16.763 --> 09:20.700
Oh, yeah.
It's gone. Huh.

09:20.734 --> 09:23.069
You know, I had a cold
recently.

09:23.103 --> 09:25.137
I think that may have
affected my voice,

09:25.155 --> 09:27.757
like, in certain British ways.

09:27.791 --> 09:29.609
Well, that's all there is
to that story,

09:29.643 --> 09:31.010
so no need for
any more questions.

09:31.028 --> 09:32.111
You have a cold?

09:32.146 --> 09:34.080
Can I feel your glands?

09:34.114 --> 09:35.998
Sure.

09:36.049 --> 09:38.676
Wow, you are wearing a lot of
moisturizer on your throat.

09:38.796 --> 09:40.736
Best way to prevent crow's neck.

09:40.788 --> 09:42.588
Is this glitter?

09:42.623 --> 09:44.089
So, those are the forms.

09:44.108 --> 09:45.441
You filled 'em out.
Great.

09:45.492 --> 09:47.376
April's gonna file these.

09:47.411 --> 09:50.179
Hey, when is the thing
you're doing in the park?

09:50.230 --> 09:53.732
I'd love to come by and maybe
help administer vaccines?

09:53.750 --> 09:55.968
Oh. Are you a doctor,
somehow?

09:56.003 --> 09:58.571
No.

09:58.605 --> 10:00.907
No follow-up to that?
Okay, great.

10:00.941 --> 10:03.426
Um, well, I'm not actually gonna
be attending the event,

10:03.460 --> 10:04.977
so if you could
just give me the permit,

10:05.012 --> 10:06.262
so that I can go home
to Indianapolis

10:06.296 --> 10:09.882
and never come back here?

10:09.917 --> 10:14.070
I am in love with Nadia
Whatever-her-last-name-is,

10:14.121 --> 10:15.454
and I'm gonna keep her here,

10:15.489 --> 10:17.089
using the most powerful
weapon I have--

10:17.123 --> 10:19.642
bureaucratic incompetence.

10:19.693 --> 10:24.547
Oh, no. You filled out
Form 3208.

10:24.581 --> 10:27.216
You were supposed to
fill out Form 3248.

10:27.251 --> 10:28.901
Oh, God.

10:28.935 --> 10:30.736
This is to lease a hangar
at the airport.

10:30.754 --> 10:33.055
I know. It's so crazy,
it almost sounds made up.

10:33.090 --> 10:34.440
Bureaucracy, right?

10:34.474 --> 10:37.460
What are you gonna do?
Huh. Weird.

10:37.494 --> 10:40.596
Someone left out a blender,
fresh fruits, and rum?

10:40.631 --> 10:42.648
I guess we gotta, like,
make Daiquiris now.

10:42.683 --> 10:45.034

let me first say

10:54.428 --> 10:56.812
that I am a big fan
of your writing.

10:56.847 --> 10:58.698
Thank you.

10:58.732 --> 11:00.132
It's good stuff.

11:00.167 --> 11:02.635
Really good stuff.

11:02.669 --> 11:04.937
Okay, does anyone else here
see a double standard?

11:04.972 --> 11:07.106
Councilman Dexhart
is currently being sued

11:07.140 --> 11:09.158
by two different women
for sexual harassment,

11:09.209 --> 11:12.111
one of whom was the judge
in the first woman's trial.

11:12.145 --> 11:13.763
She was talking dirty to me.

11:13.814 --> 11:14.897
She was reading the emails

11:14.948 --> 11:16.365
that you sent
to the first woman.

11:16.400 --> 11:17.950
Look, I obviously

11:17.984 --> 11:20.636
never meant to embarrass
the parks department.

11:20.687 --> 11:22.655
My personal account
is set to "private."

11:22.689 --> 11:24.957
Yeah, I don't even know
what she writes on there!

11:24.992 --> 11:27.376
Well, you may not know
what she's writing, but we do.

11:27.427 --> 11:30.863
In a shocking twist
to an already juicy story,

11:30.898 --> 11:33.466
we have obtained access
to Ms. Meagle's account,

11:37.938 --> 11:41.407
Damn it, Typhoon!
Why'd you do this?

11:41.425 --> 11:42.808
Maybe if you had bothered

11:42.843 --> 11:46.395
to come to my <i>Great Gatsby</i>
<i>Brunch,</i> you'd know.

11:46.446 --> 11:47.997
I don't even need
an exact number.

11:48.031 --> 11:49.114
Just ballpark it.

11:49.132 --> 11:50.600
That's all I need
to get started.

11:50.634 --> 11:51.884
Or, I'm sure
the state government

11:51.902 --> 11:53.102
would love to use your money

11:53.153 --> 11:55.755
to hire more bureaucrats,
maybe build a library.

11:55.789 --> 11:58.958
Fine, a ballpark figure.

12:09.186 --> 12:11.404
Another word for "jokes"
is "lies."

12:11.438 --> 12:14.173
I do not lie.
Therefore, I do not joke.

12:14.207 --> 12:16.225
Mr. Swanson,
an estate of this size

12:16.260 --> 12:17.360
means that your children

12:17.394 --> 12:19.028
would never have to work
a day in their lives.

12:19.079 --> 12:20.779
This is going to take
some time.

12:20.797 --> 12:22.765

tax shelters.

12:22.799 --> 12:24.083
That's enough.

12:24.101 --> 12:27.186
I do not need some drawn-out
legal expedition

12:27.204 --> 12:28.821
to tell me what I knew
when I was eight.

12:28.855 --> 12:30.389
Here's my original will.

you have to

12:32.426 --> 12:33.392
to make it official,

- No.

- So you <i>do</i> think I'm annoying.

that you work with,

14:32.507 --> 14:34.825

what you ask

14:34.859 --> 14:36.109

16:22.433 --> 16:23.850
for when you die,

16:23.901 --> 16:26.403
it's tough, confronting
your own mortality,

16:26.437 --> 16:30.157
and I think it's got you
spinning a little bit.

16:30.191 --> 16:31.558
Am I right?

16:31.592 --> 16:32.893
Wow.

16:32.927 --> 16:35.028
I had not considered that.

16:35.079 --> 16:36.997
Yes, I think that maybe
you are on to something.

16:37.031 --> 16:38.165
Yeah.

16:38.199 --> 16:40.217
Just know that it's
perfectly healthy

16:40.251 --> 16:42.686
to be thinking about--

16:42.720 --> 16:43.937
Oh, you're joking.

16:43.988 --> 16:45.071
Yes, son, I am.

16:45.106 --> 16:46.823
First joke ever.

16:46.857 --> 16:48.291
Don't care for it.

16:48.326 --> 16:50.210
Death does not scare me.

16:50.261 --> 16:52.896
What I am worried about
is spoiling my children.

16:52.930 --> 16:54.614
I don't want 'em to be
the kind of people

16:54.665 --> 16:57.667
who never work,
live off their trust funds,

16:57.702 --> 16:59.669
who buy their wooden furniture.

16:59.704 --> 17:02.305
I will leave my children
$50 apiece

17:02.323 --> 17:03.824
for the cab home
from my funeral

17:03.858 --> 17:06.026
and a steak dinner,
end of discussion.

17:06.077 --> 17:07.077
Okay.

17:07.111 --> 17:08.127
I mean, look, it doesn't matter

17:08.162 --> 17:09.612
how much money
you leave your kids.

17:09.630 --> 17:12.516
What matters is that you teach
them the right values.

17:12.550 --> 17:14.451
But, if something
horrible happens,

17:14.484 --> 17:15.752
and you want your kids
to be left alone

17:15.786 --> 17:16.986
with no safety net,

17:17.003 --> 17:18.622
just so they can learn
some kind of weird lesson,

17:18.656 --> 17:20.891
then, by all means,
leave your fortune

17:20.925 --> 17:24.578
to the wild boar
who gores you to death.

17:24.612 --> 17:28.214
I'd never lose to a boar.

17:28.249 --> 17:29.249
[Dart hits board]

17:34.238 --> 17:36.907
I'm sorry if I can be
little annoying at times,

17:36.941 --> 17:38.842
but one person's annoying

17:38.876 --> 17:41.211
is another person's
inspiring and heroic,

17:41.229 --> 17:44.314
so, you know,
who are we to judge?

17:44.348 --> 17:46.716
And I'm sorry
for writing those things.

17:46.751 --> 17:48.568
Some of those things.

17:48.603 --> 17:51.755
I can't promise
that I won't be inspiring

17:51.789 --> 17:53.473
and heroic in the future.

17:53.508 --> 17:55.809
And I can't promise that I
won't complain about it.

17:55.843 --> 17:57.978
Deal.

17:58.029 --> 17:59.646
I got you an apology present.

17:59.697 --> 18:00.697
Oh!

18:00.731 --> 18:02.098
It is all of
your favorite lipsticks

18:02.116 --> 18:03.099
and nail polishes,

18:03.117 --> 18:04.100
and I got the same ones too.

18:04.118 --> 18:05.235
I printed out a schedule,

18:05.269 --> 18:06.653
so we can wear them
at the same time.

18:06.704 --> 18:08.655
Now, I would like you
to open each one

18:08.706 --> 18:09.746
in front of me, and tell me

18:09.773 --> 18:11.324
how you feel about them
individually.

18:11.375 --> 18:12.909
Let me take a picture.

18:12.944 --> 18:14.244
Are you tweeting this?

18:14.278 --> 18:15.662
Mm-hmm.

18:15.713 --> 18:16.663
What's the hashtag gonna be?

18:16.714 --> 18:17.947
"Boss bitch" or "bitch boss"?

18:17.965 --> 18:19.216
Yeah,
it's "psycho boss."

18:19.250 --> 18:21.673
Eh, I don't hate that.

18:23.354 --> 18:25.702
Benjamin, after thinking
about what you said,

18:25.822 --> 18:26.733
I've decided to leave

18:26.853 --> 18:29.485
each of my children
5% of my fortune.

18:29.605 --> 18:31.823
Wow, 5 whole percent.

18:31.858 --> 18:34.109
So, I guess you are gonna
teach them a lesson.

18:34.143 --> 18:37.379
Oh, my God, that's 5%?

18:37.413 --> 18:39.031
That is a lot of money.

18:39.065 --> 18:40.665
Wait, is this a joke?

18:40.717 --> 18:42.084
It is not a joke.

18:42.118 --> 18:44.052
Not that an accountant
would know the difference.

18:44.087 --> 18:47.222
Also, if something should
happen to Diane and me,

18:47.256 --> 18:49.091
we decided
that the kids should go

18:49.125 --> 18:51.176
to the most important
people in our lives.

18:51.227 --> 18:54.980
Ron, I'm--I'm incredibly
flattered.

18:55.014 --> 18:57.298
Ralph Piatkowski
and his wife Helen.

18:57.316 --> 18:59.735
He's the Maitre D'
at Mulligan's Steakhouse,

18:59.769 --> 19:01.820
and he knows me
better than anyone.

19:01.854 --> 19:03.638
However, if they are not
able to do it,

19:03.656 --> 19:05.991
which seems likely,
as they're in their 90s,

19:06.025 --> 19:08.643
you and Leslie
are choice number two.

19:08.661 --> 19:10.245
I'm honored.

19:10.279 --> 19:11.813
Everyone, take your seats,

19:11.831 --> 19:14.332
so this witch hunt
may proceed as scheduled.

19:14.367 --> 19:16.418
Speaking of, uh,
where are the witches?

19:16.452 --> 19:17.869
They're right here!

19:17.920 --> 19:20.455
Well, we're not witches.
That's sexist and offensive.

19:20.489 --> 19:21.656
But we're right here,

19:21.674 --> 19:23.341
and we are not gonna
sit in this room

19:23.376 --> 19:25.177
and let you drag our names
through the mud

19:25.211 --> 19:27.179
just to score some
cheap political points.

19:27.213 --> 19:29.097
How dare you demean the value

19:29.132 --> 19:31.049
of the political points
I'm scoring?

19:31.100 --> 19:32.467
We have had enough.

19:32.501 --> 19:34.770
I am going back to work so I can
do some good for this town,

19:34.804 --> 19:36.772
and my friend Donna
is coming with me.

19:36.806 --> 19:38.557
Hmm.
I prefer "El Diablo."

19:38.608 --> 19:40.675
Uh, this is not over,
Ms. Knope!

19:40.693 --> 19:43.228
Donna, quit punishing me!

19:43.279 --> 19:45.147
- I miss you.
- Uh-uh!

19:45.181 --> 19:47.182
Bridge burned, Typhoon.

19:47.200 --> 19:50.202
Or should I say, "Norman"?
Uh-huh.

19:50.236 --> 19:52.353
Okay, I'm just gonna man up,

19:52.371 --> 19:53.855
tell her how I feel,

19:53.873 --> 19:55.073
and hope she feels
the same way about me,

19:55.124 --> 19:56.208
and that's that.

19:56.242 --> 19:57.325
If she doesn't,
no big deal. It's done.

19:57.359 --> 19:58.460
I'm an adult.
Let's do it.

19:58.494 --> 20:00.212
Great.

20:00.246 --> 20:02.247
Nope, I can't do it.
New plan.

20:02.298 --> 20:03.381
Tell her all the screw-ups
were your fault.

20:03.416 --> 20:04.800
I'll tell her I had to
cover for you,

20:04.834 --> 20:05.801
because you are so dumb.

20:05.835 --> 20:08.136
Nadia!

20:08.171 --> 20:10.755
We're very sorry for everything
you went through today.

20:10.807 --> 20:13.975
I have reserved the park
for your event.

20:14.010 --> 20:17.813
Now, April has something
she'd like to admit.

20:17.847 --> 20:19.931
Tom wants me to tell you that
all the screw-ups were my fault,

20:19.982 --> 20:22.050
but really, he kept messing up
so that you would

20:22.068 --> 20:23.268
stay in Pawnee
as long as possible

20:23.319 --> 20:25.103
because he is super into you.

20:25.154 --> 20:28.056
Okay.

20:28.074 --> 20:29.441
Several questions.

20:29.492 --> 20:31.660
- Is any part of him British?
- No.

20:31.694 --> 20:33.411
So, that was just weird,
panicky dude behavior?

20:33.446 --> 20:34.496
- Yeah.
- Okay.

20:34.530 --> 20:35.690
I'm just trying to figure out

20:35.698 --> 20:38.266
if acting that insane
is, like, romantic,

20:38.284 --> 20:39.818
or totally scary.

20:39.869 --> 20:42.454
I'll go with romantic.

20:42.488 --> 20:43.889
He is kind of cute.

20:43.923 --> 20:45.457
What's his deal?

20:45.491 --> 20:47.375
He's sweet, he's cool,

20:47.410 --> 20:48.793
and you're, like,
way out of his league,

20:48.828 --> 20:51.946
so there's literally
no risk for you at all here.

20:51.964 --> 20:52.947
Okay.

20:52.965 --> 20:54.366
Well, I am going
to Rwanda in, like,

20:54.400 --> 20:56.284
two weeks for my job,
so, what the hell?

20:56.302 --> 20:57.419
Cool.

20:57.453 --> 20:58.470
So, you want to go out with me?

20:58.504 --> 20:59.971
Yes, please.

21:00.006 --> 21:02.974
Okay. Bye.

21:03.009 --> 21:05.627
Okay, you owe me,
like, 1,000 favors.

21:05.645 --> 21:07.312
See ya.

21:07.641 --> 21:15.115
