<i>His girls are working hard

02:07.509 --> 02:10.408
<i>All I gave a fuck about
is if some nigga wanted them.</i>

02:10.411 --> 02:11.578
<i>Or if their hair looked good,</i>

02:11.580 --> 02:14.380
<i>and if they felt sexy
in them tight dresses.</i>

02:14.382 --> 02:17.651

Ain't she got
some homework to do?

02:28.897 --> 02:31.431
Shut the fuck up, Slim.

02:31.433 --> 02:34.835
One day she's gonna run
your motherfucking block.

02:34.837 --> 02:36.902
You better show her
some respect now.

02:36.904 --> 02:38.607
And maybe she'll
show you some later.

02:39.707 --> 02:40.742
Now play cards.

02:43.344 --> 02:44.910
Once you're in this game,

02:44.912 --> 02:46.349
you're in it for life.

02:47.749 --> 02:49.384
It's gonna take you for a ride.

02:50.386 --> 02:52.519
And when it does...

02:52.521 --> 02:55.588
the only thing you can to trust
is your money.

02:55.590 --> 02:58.025
Never let a bitch get close
to your heart.

03:02.398 --> 03:03.466
Get that for daddy.

03:07.302 --> 03:09.605
Hey, yo, dawg, man, I'm sorry

03:10.738 --> 03:12.673
Don't you think
she's a bit too young?

03:12.675 --> 03:14.510
You ain't never too young
to find your way.

03:19.682 --> 03:21.515
<i>When the night was over,</i>

03:21.517 --> 03:23.349

03:24.452 --> 03:26.521
<i>there was only one girl
I wanted to see.</i>

03:28.423 --> 03:29.625
<i>Sweet little Nikki.</i>

03:36.964 --> 03:38.400
Come on out.

03:43.939 --> 03:47.039
<i>Since the day I saw her,
I was in love.</i>

03:47.041 --> 03:49.675
<i>And now that I was working
with my daddy...</i>

03:49.677 --> 03:51.046
<i>I just want to buy her shit.</i>

04:23.511 --> 04:25.581
I love you so much.

05:06.554 --> 05:07.653
He just fainted.

05:07.655 --> 05:08.855
Mae, listen.

05:08.857 --> 05:10.023
- Babe.
- Mae.

05:10.025 --> 05:11.958

- Mae, listen to me.

05:11.960 --> 05:13.560
- Mae, come on. Mae, he's gone.
- Babe. Wake up, babe.

05:13.562 --> 05:14.761
- He's gone. He's gone, Mae.
- They can't take you!

05:14.763 --> 05:16.196
Babe, why are they taking you?

05:16.198 --> 05:17.863
- Come on.
- Don't take him!

05:17.865 --> 05:19.865
Don't take him away!

05:19.867 --> 05:21.802
- Mae, come on.
- Don't take him!

05:21.804 --> 05:23.636
Listen, Mae. Come on.

05:23.638 --> 05:24.971
<i>Just like that, he was gone.</i>

05:24.973 --> 05:28.040
Oh, god. I got nothing.

05:28.042 --> 05:29.175
This way, Mae.

05:29.177 --> 05:31.745
<i>And I had to continue.</i>

05:31.747 --> 05:34.747
<i>He didn't say shit
on how to play this one out.</i>

05:34.749 --> 05:37.716
She needs you. Come on, Mae.

05:37.718 --> 05:40.920
Come on. She needs you.
She's gonna need you.

05:40.922 --> 05:42.023
She needs you.

05:44.593 --> 05:47.060
What are we gonna do?

05:47.062 --> 05:48.495
I don't know.

05:48.497 --> 05:49.999
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

05:51.833 --> 05:54.134
He said he weren't
going to leave me.

05:54.136 --> 05:56.168
What are we gonna do?

05:56.170 --> 05:58.971
What are we gonna do?

05:58.973 --> 06:00.841
What are we gonna do?

06:00.843 --> 06:03.543
Oh, my god.
What are we gonna do?

06:03.545 --> 06:04.713
<i>I'm gonna look out for moms.</i>

06:05.848 --> 06:08.148
<i>And as for Nikki...</i>

06:08.150 --> 06:09.583
<i>I ain't gonna let anything
happen to her</i>

06:09.585 --> 06:10.653
<i>as long as I'm alive.</i>

06:11.752 --> 06:12.888
<i>These are my girls now.</i>

06:14.989 --> 06:17.156
<i>I'm gonna protect them.</i>

06:17.158 --> 06:18.858
<i>I'm gonna take care of them.</i>

06:18.860 --> 06:19.861
<i>You know...</i>

06:20.696 --> 06:21.763
<i>pimp shit.</i>

06:28.504 --> 06:29.905
Come on!

06:39.213 --> 06:40.649
Don't let her shoot!

06:44.520 --> 06:46.920
Oh! Yo, yo! Pass it, man!
Pass it!

06:52.694 --> 06:53.929
Where's the ball?

06:55.263 --> 06:57.030
- Foul!
- Hell, no!

06:57.032 --> 06:58.564
My hands didn't touch you
and you know it.

06:58.566 --> 07:00.100
Our ball. Check it.

07:00.102 --> 07:02.802
Huh! You think you're all-star
or some shit?

07:02.804 --> 07:04.607
Let's see you try
and get past me again.

07:08.076 --> 07:09.511
You know what it is.

07:10.879 --> 07:12.248
She thinks
she's all tough, huh.

07:17.285 --> 07:18.552
Don't let her through. Come on.

07:18.554 --> 07:19.619
Block her.

07:19.621 --> 07:22.155
- Oh, my god!
- Yes!

07:22.157 --> 07:23.290
Where are you going, player?

07:24.227 --> 07:27.226
Yo, are you deaf?
I got money on this one.

07:27.228 --> 07:29.261
Twenty-one.
Game's over.

07:29.263 --> 07:30.329
Oh, fuck that.

07:30.331 --> 07:32.501
We play until I say game over,
I ain't done yet.

07:33.335 --> 07:34.834
Yo, you deaf?

07:34.836 --> 07:37.540
Put the money down,
come get your game on.

07:42.143 --> 07:43.143
Or what?

07:43.145 --> 07:46.079
Oh, yeah, you're crazy
just like your mama...

07:47.215 --> 07:48.281
Come on, bitch!

07:50.151 --> 07:51.750
Come on!

07:51.752 --> 07:52.851

Oh, shit. Yeah.

07:56.258 --> 07:57.790
Get her!

07:57.792 --> 07:59.893
Fuck her up! Let her know.

07:59.895 --> 08:00.961
Yo, yo, yo.

08:00.963 --> 08:02.028
She's crazy.

08:04.299 --> 08:05.798
Get the fuck back!

08:05.800 --> 08:07.067
Get the fuck back!

08:08.737 --> 08:10.235
Come on!

08:10.237 --> 08:13.139
I want my fucking money!

08:13.141 --> 08:15.111
When I put my hands on,
it's to throw some.

08:52.146 --> 08:53.647
Nikki!

08:53.649 --> 08:55.648
You look good
in them jeans, girl.

08:55.650 --> 08:57.185
Oh, and just for you.

09:00.288 --> 09:01.891
Come here and give me a kiss.

09:09.231 --> 09:10.397
Does that hurt?

09:10.399 --> 09:12.765
Only if you keep touching it
like that.

09:12.767 --> 09:14.200
I'll be all right.

09:14.202 --> 09:16.802
You got to be. 'Cause we have
some partying to do later.

09:16.804 --> 09:18.705
Shit. That's tonight?

09:18.707 --> 09:20.440
You know I got the girls
working tonight.

09:20.442 --> 09:22.775
I guess it's just gonna be me
and my fly jeans,

09:22.777 --> 09:24.146
dancing all alone.

09:25.146 --> 09:26.980
Well, I ain't gonna miss that.

09:26.982 --> 09:28.048
I gotta go.

09:28.050 --> 09:29.948
I gotta ask
for those extra shifts.

09:29.950 --> 09:31.750
- Hope you get 'em.
- Mm-hm.

09:31.752 --> 09:33.189
You ain't worried
about money again, are you?

09:34.923 --> 09:36.025
I got it under control.

09:37.758 --> 09:38.827
Go get 'em.

09:47.001 --> 09:49.168
Louisa! Louisa!

09:49.170 --> 09:50.903
Louisa!

09:50.905 --> 09:52.138
Get your ass up
and get poppin', baby.

09:52.140 --> 09:53.972
Niggas are on our corner
right now!

09:53.974 --> 09:55.140
You know, I just needed
a little sleep.

09:55.142 --> 09:56.241
The baby cried all night.

09:56.243 --> 09:57.309
I made that clear to you

09:57.311 --> 09:58.711
when you were changing diapers
under the bridge.

09:58.713 --> 09:59.580
That's your shit.

09:59.582 --> 10:01.748
And you're responsible
for your shit.

10:01.750 --> 10:03.018
But, right now...

10:04.049 --> 10:05.384
tick-tock, your pussy's
on my clock. You hear me?

10:05.386 --> 10:06.952
Get your ass up!

10:06.954 --> 10:08.354
Niggas are hungry out here.

10:08.356 --> 10:09.425
And it's feeding time.

10:10.992 --> 10:12.191
You heard that, Maria?

10:12.193 --> 10:14.760
Your sister's feeding me excuses
on why she's so damn lazy.

10:14.762 --> 10:16.328
We didn't know
it was gonna be like this.

10:16.330 --> 10:17.397
Like what?

10:17.399 --> 10:19.032
We need new clothes
for the baby,

10:19.034 --> 10:20.100
we need a phone card.

10:20.102 --> 10:21.768
Okay. Well, I need shit, too.

10:21.770 --> 10:22.969
But you bitches
be sleeping all day.

10:22.971 --> 10:25.171
You ain't had no time to think
about me and what I need.

10:25.173 --> 10:27.039
Ain't that right, Louisa?

10:27.041 --> 10:29.241
Y'all need to bust
your ass for me,

10:29.243 --> 10:31.945
the way I bust my ass
for you, Boricuas.

10:31.947 --> 10:34.813
Just $20. For the baby.

10:34.815 --> 10:36.816
- You gotta show up.
- Thank you.

10:36.818 --> 10:38.020
Hey, you feel me?

10:39.987 --> 10:41.089
For the baby.

10:42.390 --> 10:43.458
Thank you.

10:44.793 --> 10:47.326
- You got your phone?
- Yes.

10:47.328 --> 10:49.428
Well, where the fuck is it?

10:49.430 --> 10:51.733
Okay. See, this is the shit
that drives me crazy.

10:53.200 --> 10:54.100
Is it charged?

10:54.102 --> 10:56.235
Yes. I had it on the charger
all night.

10:56.237 --> 10:58.104
Text me as soon
as you got out of a car.

10:58.106 --> 10:59.873
I need to know
if the corners are hot.

10:59.875 --> 11:00.773
And lay off the fast food,

11:00.775 --> 11:01.707
'cause your thighs
are getting bigger,

11:01.709 --> 11:03.278
and we ain't got no money
for new clothes.

11:04.212 --> 11:05.448
Okay, Wednesday.

11:35.977 --> 11:37.213
When are you
gonna make it rain?

11:41.049 --> 11:42.251
I'm gonna pay you back.

11:43.484 --> 11:46.286
Yeah? With what money?

11:46.288 --> 11:47.890
Don't you worry
about that.

11:49.056 --> 11:50.925
Like I said,
I'm gonna pay you back.

11:52.227 --> 11:55.495
Why are you making promises
you can't keep?

11:55.497 --> 11:59.865
You think it's easy for me
being locked up like that?

11:59.867 --> 12:03.235
Dirty bitches be all up
in my face making me crazy.

12:03.237 --> 12:04.236
Drugs is making you crazy.

12:04.238 --> 12:06.274
Don't be talking to me
like I'm some junkie.

12:07.442 --> 12:10.076
I'm your mother,
show me some respect.

12:10.078 --> 12:12.010
Yeah, you're right.
You ain't no junkie, huh?

12:12.012 --> 12:13.078
'Cause junkies
don't have a place to stay

12:13.080 --> 12:14.147
with food on the table.

12:14.149 --> 12:15.215
You're just like
every other woman

12:15.217 --> 12:16.283
spending my hard-earned money.

12:16.285 --> 12:20.419
If you think eating cereal
for dinner is making it,

12:20.421 --> 12:22.824
then I might as well be dead
than to live this shit.

12:23.925 --> 12:25.457
Running in the street,

12:25.459 --> 12:27.527
selling pussy like you got game.

12:29.197 --> 12:30.330
All you've got

12:30.332 --> 12:32.898
is a bunch of bitches
sucking dick for five dollars.

12:32.900 --> 12:34.967
I thought you was going
to be bigger than that.

12:34.969 --> 12:36.872
If it weren't for them,
your ass would still be in jail.

12:38.006 --> 12:40.306
Damn ho was saying shit.

12:40.308 --> 12:42.140
Let me tell you something.

12:42.142 --> 12:48.081
Back in the day, your daddy
had me in new cars all the time.

12:48.083 --> 12:52.619
Taking me out to dinner
every Saturday night.

12:52.621 --> 12:54.890
What you got for me? Huh?

12:55.457 --> 12:57.326
What you got?

12:59.593 --> 13:02.461
We're still riding around
in this same shit.

13:02.463 --> 13:04.465
I remember
when we bought this car.

13:16.944 --> 13:19.245
- Get out.
- Well...

13:19.247 --> 13:21.614
I sure hope there's hot water.

13:21.616 --> 13:24.153
'Cause you could use a shower.

13:46.974 --> 13:49.042
Oh! Hey, hi!

13:49.044 --> 13:50.309
Charlie,
there's a party going on

13:50.311 --> 13:52.946
and you didn't even invite me.

13:52.948 --> 13:55.083
- Hey, Win.
- Who the fuck are these clowns?

13:56.184 --> 13:57.283
They live upstairs.

13:57.285 --> 13:59.719
Didn't I say no boys
in the house?

13:59.721 --> 14:01.523
Boys like that are gonna rob you
of your youth.

14:03.992 --> 14:05.591
These your friends from school?

14:05.593 --> 14:07.994
Yeah. Um, this is Kim,

14:07.996 --> 14:09.595
and that's Nina.

14:09.597 --> 14:10.933
How old are you, girls?

14:11.498 --> 14:12.567
Eighteen.

14:17.372 --> 14:18.674
Look, we're 16.

14:20.275 --> 14:22.011
Yo, Nina, won't you, uh...

14:23.078 --> 14:24.446
give homeboy here some hit.

14:26.348 --> 14:29.248
Yeah. Oh, uh...

14:29.250 --> 14:30.653
Charlie, you know
what the fuck's going on here?

14:32.020 --> 14:33.021
Yeah.

14:34.588 --> 14:36.058
You sucked dick before?

14:38.059 --> 14:40.293
- You sucked dick before?
- Yeah.

14:40.295 --> 14:43.262
Okay, then get to it.
Take it easy on him.

14:43.264 --> 14:44.764
Oh, is this for real
or what?

14:44.766 --> 14:47.200
What the fuck you thought
it was, a magic show?

14:47.202 --> 14:48.735
'Cause I don't see
no fuckin' magician's anywhere.

14:48.737 --> 14:51.537
All I see is a house full
of pussy.

14:51.539 --> 14:53.342
Charlie,
take them to the bail room.

14:54.208 --> 14:55.343
This one's on me.

15:07.756 --> 15:10.089
I never sucked dick before.

15:10.091 --> 15:11.360
Then this ain't for you.

15:12.626 --> 15:14.029
Get the fuck out of here!

15:21.602 --> 15:23.137
No more parties at this house.

15:31.545 --> 15:34.246
Yo, I'm serious.
I was on like, the 20-yard line

15:34.248 --> 15:35.581
with three haters
hanging off my back

15:35.583 --> 15:38.051
then I just start
dragging them from me.

15:38.053 --> 15:39.619
Just dragging them down
to the end zone.

15:39.621 --> 15:42.321
Scored my touchdown, boom!
Sipped on my forty.

15:42.323 --> 15:45.059
There you go! There you go.

15:46.261 --> 15:47.295
Come and get it!

16:08.716 --> 16:10.649
Yo-ho, girl.

16:10.651 --> 16:13.152
Oh, oh, oh, okay!

16:13.154 --> 16:14.620
- Look who it is.
- Yeah, yo.

16:14.622 --> 16:16.188
Where you been, player?

16:16.190 --> 16:17.590
Shit. Hustlin' like you,
Science.

16:17.592 --> 16:19.091
You'd kill nobody, right?

16:19.093 --> 16:21.259
Ain't none of these hoes
worth killin' by a pimp.

16:21.261 --> 16:22.662
Your mom fuckin' up again?

16:22.664 --> 16:24.429
And again, and again.

16:24.431 --> 16:26.432
Ah, yeah, man, see,
all that babysitting shit

16:26.434 --> 16:27.600
is gonna wear you out.

16:27.602 --> 16:29.268
See, girls come
with so much shit,

16:29.270 --> 16:30.769
even broke
they high maintenance.

16:30.771 --> 16:31.837
Damn right. Shit.

16:31.839 --> 16:33.105
What about you, dawg?

16:33.107 --> 16:34.740
Chop shop's been tight.

16:34.742 --> 16:37.442
You gotta see the dope shit
that just came through.

16:37.444 --> 16:39.378
I rode one of them
up to this new spot over there,

16:39.380 --> 16:40.645
on the north side of the Bronx,

16:40.647 --> 16:42.115
Erotic City.

16:42.117 --> 16:43.182
Hey, that's where
we're gonna go

16:43.184 --> 16:45.283
and find you some, uh,
inspiration.

16:45.285 --> 16:47.220
Hell, yeah.
That's what I'm talking about.

16:47.222 --> 16:49.187
Hey, rich brothers roaming
in Maseratis.

16:49.189 --> 16:50.722
They bring in girls
from all over.

16:50.724 --> 16:52.491
That's where we're gonna find
some new pussy.

16:52.493 --> 16:54.159
- You could hook it up?
- Get outta here. Yeah!

16:54.161 --> 16:55.427
I'm gonna get us
on the guest list for Saturday.

16:55.429 --> 16:58.630
Shit! I already got us on the
guest list for Saturday night.

16:58.632 --> 17:00.133
Let me quarterback this one.

17:00.135 --> 17:02.501
You know, united,
we could solve our problems,

17:02.503 --> 17:04.303
divided, we got shit.

17:04.305 --> 17:05.704
Now there you go
going off Farrakhan on me.

17:05.705 --> 17:07.240
You know I don't understand
that shit?

17:07.242 --> 17:08.673
Hey, what are we doing

17:08.675 --> 17:09.775
talking shit?

17:09.777 --> 17:11.510
Let's go talk some money
right now!

17:11.512 --> 17:13.513
Damn. Now you're speaking
my language.

17:15.415 --> 17:16.652
That's my girl.

17:19.685 --> 17:20.653
Make us some shit!

17:20.655 --> 17:22.555
- Come on, G, damn!
- God!

17:22.557 --> 17:24.156
- Why are you laughing?
- 'Cause I'm about to win.

17:24.157 --> 17:25.223
Oh, okay.

17:25.224 --> 17:26.159
- Come on, G.
- What was that smile?

17:26.161 --> 17:27.593
- Yeah, yeah. Kick back...
- Double back.

17:32.466 --> 17:34.200
- Are we rolling?
- Give it to me.

17:34.202 --> 17:35.334
Give me my money.

17:35.336 --> 17:36.801
Yeah!

17:36.803 --> 17:37.869
- My bad!
- Whatever.

17:37.871 --> 17:38.938
Thank you!

17:38.940 --> 17:40.906
I feel so rich. Thank you.

17:40.908 --> 17:43.175
You're the man.

17:43.177 --> 17:44.509
I wish I was hitting that hard.

17:44.511 --> 17:46.278
Keep dreaming, yo.

17:46.280 --> 17:47.946
You could never land
a girl like Nikki.

17:47.948 --> 17:50.215
Well, I was all over that!

17:50.217 --> 17:52.384
- Quit lying, dawg.
- Hell, yeah.

17:52.386 --> 17:54.123
Yo, Nikki sucked me off, too.

17:54.821 --> 17:56.622
Get out.

17:56.624 --> 17:58.427
Was it as good
as everybody's saying?

18:01.195 --> 18:02.662
I mean, it was all right.

18:02.664 --> 18:03.596
It wasn't that tight, though.

18:03.598 --> 18:04.631
Oh, for real?

18:04.633 --> 18:05.464
How would you know
when you ain't seen a pussy

18:05.466 --> 18:07.368
since you popped out
of your mama?

18:08.836 --> 18:10.970
Sounds like y'all need
to get your money back.

18:10.972 --> 18:12.371
I ain't paid her nothing.

18:12.373 --> 18:13.573
That's the problem.

18:13.575 --> 18:15.473
Y'all need to pay up.
Twenty each.

18:16.344 --> 18:18.647
Man, fuck that bitch,
and fuck you.

18:20.748 --> 18:23.318
Sounds like you tried,
but your pipe was too small.

18:24.751 --> 18:25.820
Everything all right?

18:26.988 --> 18:28.190
We're cool.

18:29.389 --> 18:30.522
We're cool now.

18:30.524 --> 18:32.325
Get the fuck outta here.

18:32.327 --> 18:33.362
Fuck outta here.

18:34.662 --> 18:35.928
Hey, what did I miss?

18:35.930 --> 18:37.296
You missed shit.

18:37.298 --> 18:38.364
We're out.

18:38.366 --> 18:39.464
- It's early.
- Then I'm out.

18:39.466 --> 18:41.267
I'm out of here, Science.

18:41.269 --> 18:42.069
All right.

18:44.004 --> 18:45.938
Hey.
What's wrong with you?

18:45.940 --> 18:47.138
Where the hell
did you go?

18:47.140 --> 18:49.407
- Are you serious right now?
- Don't play stupid with me.

18:49.409 --> 18:50.675
I saw the way you was dancing
with them dudes.

18:50.677 --> 18:51.611
We were just dancing.

18:51.613 --> 18:52.545
Then why was they talking
about your ass

18:52.547 --> 18:54.247
like they was tapping that shit
for free?

18:54.249 --> 18:56.449
'Cause I got a nice ass.

18:56.451 --> 18:58.384
Well, they're paying
for it, too, now.

18:58.386 --> 19:00.653
Who gives a fuck
what they think?

19:00.655 --> 19:01.921
Everybody knows
that we're together,

19:01.923 --> 19:03.923
- and it ain't like that.
- I know!

19:03.925 --> 19:05.590
Then why are you acting
like a jealous boyfriend?

19:05.592 --> 19:07.359
- I'm not! It's just...
- It's just what?

19:07.361 --> 19:08.362
Ah...

19:10.565 --> 19:11.667
We're broke.

19:12.300 --> 19:13.365
What?

19:13.367 --> 19:14.967
I had to bail Ma out.

19:14.969 --> 19:17.502
But that's my money, too.
Don't I get a say in that?

19:17.504 --> 19:18.506
You're right.

19:19.440 --> 19:20.806
I should have told you.

19:20.808 --> 19:22.540
But I'm gonna figure it out.

19:22.542 --> 19:24.309
How are we gonna make
that money back, Win?

19:24.311 --> 19:26.615
I'm gonna get some new bitches,
and I'm gonna fix it.

19:32.453 --> 19:34.053
Hey.

19:34.055 --> 19:35.657
Let's fix this together.

19:37.558 --> 19:39.357
We should have done this
a long time ago.

19:39.359 --> 19:40.326
- You need me.
- You're my girl.

19:40.328 --> 19:41.794
I don't want nobody
touching you like that.

19:41.796 --> 19:43.729
Sex ain't mean shit!

19:43.731 --> 19:46.300
As long as you got me,
ain't no one gonna break us.

19:47.934 --> 19:49.704
You've seen the way
they look at me.

19:50.871 --> 19:52.373
It's just business.

19:53.407 --> 19:54.542
Hey, hey.

19:55.376 --> 19:56.912
It's just business.

20:10.925 --> 20:13.828
Oh, so you're just gonna leave
your mama starving again?

20:14.896 --> 20:16.028
Nikki!

20:16.030 --> 20:17.096
Just ignore it.

20:17.098 --> 20:18.497
How can I ignore it?

20:18.499 --> 20:20.665
I hear you whispering
up in there!

20:20.667 --> 20:23.035
Yeah, get your ass up
and make your own dinner.

20:23.037 --> 20:24.703
- Fucking lazy.
- Don't start, all right?

20:24.705 --> 20:26.372
I'm not having any
of her shit tonight, okay?

20:26.374 --> 20:27.373
I'm done playing nice.

20:27.375 --> 20:29.575
Bitch, if you've got
something to say,

20:29.577 --> 20:31.544
you come on out here
and you say it to my face.

20:31.546 --> 20:33.078
You're just gonna lay there
and let her rip on me like that?

20:33.080 --> 20:34.380
You can't let her bother you.

20:34.382 --> 20:35.847
She just called me a bitch.

20:35.849 --> 20:37.950
Ma! Go to bed!

20:37.952 --> 20:40.553
All she does,
is lay on her ass all day.

20:40.555 --> 20:42.958
You need to lay it down for her,
she's gonna keep us broke.

20:46.626 --> 20:47.628
Ma.

20:48.596 --> 20:49.665
Ma!

20:55.703 --> 20:57.403
Are you serious?

20:58.405 --> 21:00.439
Give me my remote back!
I'm watching my show!

21:00.441 --> 21:01.507
No.

21:01.509 --> 21:03.375
- Give me my remote back!
- No.

21:03.377 --> 21:04.542
Hey!

21:04.544 --> 21:06.545
No more TV for you tonight.

21:06.547 --> 21:07.680
This is between family.

21:07.682 --> 21:09.048
Nikki is family.

21:09.050 --> 21:10.482
To who?

21:10.484 --> 21:11.884
Girl...

21:11.886 --> 21:13.986
you're stupid
to keep this bitch around.

21:13.988 --> 21:15.086
She's trouble.

21:15.088 --> 21:17.522
Her daddy was a drunk...

21:17.524 --> 21:18.824
and her ma...

21:18.826 --> 21:19.828
Her mama...

21:21.428 --> 21:24.465
Her mama,
she hung herself, right?

21:25.867 --> 21:27.034
Ain't that right?

21:28.569 --> 21:29.902
I'm surprised
you ain't killed yourself.

21:29.904 --> 21:31.770
- Now, you need to stop!
- No, Win.

21:31.772 --> 21:33.571
What you want to say to me?

21:33.573 --> 21:34.707
What you want to say?

21:34.709 --> 21:36.174
You've been champing at the bit
to say something to me,

21:36.176 --> 21:37.442
Come on, say it!

21:37.444 --> 21:39.111
Fuck off!

21:39.113 --> 21:40.913
Anybody would
wanna kill themselves

21:40.915 --> 21:43.484
if they had to live
with a crazy bitch like you.

21:45.986 --> 21:47.621
I'll see you in bed, baby.

21:53.027 --> 21:55.461
You chicken shit.

21:55.463 --> 21:58.730
Oh. Oh, tough motherfucker,
she ain't no real woman.

21:58.732 --> 22:00.098
Win, she ain't no real woman.

22:00.100 --> 22:01.599
Don't be fooled
by them titties and ass.

22:01.601 --> 22:03.536
I'll make you some dinner.

22:03.538 --> 22:05.538
Fuck that!

22:05.540 --> 22:06.772
Go take her side.

22:06.774 --> 22:09.474
Ma, don't you think there's been
enough drama for the night?

22:09.476 --> 22:11.644
Can we just call it?
I'm tired of this shit!

22:11.646 --> 22:13.711
I'm tired, too.

22:13.713 --> 22:16.080
I'm tired of watching my child
being brainwashed

22:16.082 --> 22:17.450
into thinking things
that ain't right.

22:17.452 --> 22:18.717
What ain't right?

22:18.719 --> 22:20.155
I see how you look at her.

22:22.589 --> 22:24.693
She won't ever love you
like I do, Win.

22:27.828 --> 22:29.865
She won't ever love you
like I do.

22:30.598 --> 22:31.599
She's not.

22:32.633 --> 22:34.098
She's not.

22:34.100 --> 22:36.501
She can live in my house...

22:36.503 --> 22:38.037
and she can trick your mind,

22:38.039 --> 22:40.472
but she ain't gonna
ever love you like I do.

22:40.474 --> 22:41.606
Remember that.

22:41.608 --> 22:43.241
Remember your mama's words.

22:46.047 --> 22:47.449
Nikki do love me.

23:13.607 --> 23:14.874
Remember
to get the money up front.

23:14.876 --> 23:15.941
Have them place it
on the dashboard,

23:15.943 --> 23:17.076
and make sure you count it.

23:17.078 --> 23:18.076
What did I say?

23:18.078 --> 23:18.944
Get the money up front,
make sure they put it

23:18.946 --> 23:21.212
- on the dashboard.
- And?

23:21.214 --> 23:24.049
Make sure you count it,
that's important.

23:23.084 --> 23:24.182
Okay.

23:24.184 --> 23:26.018
Forty for a blow,
80 for 15 minutes.

23:26.020 --> 23:27.019
If you only catch a blow,

23:27.021 --> 23:27.953
tell them to keep their hands
off your body.

23:27.955 --> 23:30.623
You got to make that clear
from the start.

23:30.625 --> 23:31.760
Win, I heard you.

23:32.894 --> 23:34.229
I'm gonna get us a room
over there.

24:00.186 --> 24:03.122
When did hookers get so pretty?

24:03.124 --> 24:04.256
Could you take
your jacket off

24:04.258 --> 24:05.760
so I can see those tits?

24:08.695 --> 24:10.598
Oh, that is nice.

24:13.334 --> 24:15.267
First I want my blowjob,

24:15.269 --> 24:16.938
and then, I'm going to fuck you.

24:50.271 --> 24:51.306
You're in it for life.

24:53.808 --> 24:54.809
I got you.

25:01.248 --> 25:02.651
Well, get that for daddy.

25:06.052 --> 25:08.988
Did somebody place an order
for a million dollars?

25:08.990 --> 25:11.256
Uh-uh! Are those hands clean?

25:11.258 --> 25:13.028
Fuck that. You're so beautiful.

26:30.937 --> 26:32.938
Seven hundred
and sixty big ones.

26:32.940 --> 26:34.338
Not bad for four hours.

26:34.340 --> 26:36.340
Yeah, but that's some
world record shit right there.

26:36.342 --> 26:38.278
I'm so glad
you liked my idea.

26:39.280 --> 26:41.113
What you mean your idea?

26:41.115 --> 26:42.714
Yeah, my idea.

26:42.716 --> 26:43.849
You heard me, right?

26:43.851 --> 26:46.317
Nothing like a real woman
to show you how it's done.

26:46.319 --> 26:48.119
- Oh, real woman, huh?
- Mm-hm.

26:48.121 --> 26:49.488
I guess I gotta protect
the real woman, then.

26:49.490 --> 26:51.355
Mm-hm.

26:51.357 --> 26:54.093
Hey, nigga.
What the fuck you lookin' at?

26:54.095 --> 26:55.861
You see this here, hammer?

26:55.863 --> 26:57.096
Yeah, I know my bitches are bad,

26:57.098 --> 26:58.163
but if you keep staring at them
like that,

26:58.165 --> 26:59.498
I'm gonna have to charge you.

26:59.500 --> 27:01.834
Well, what the fuck you mean
you got no money, nigga?

27:01.836 --> 27:02.701
Pow, pow, pow!

27:02.703 --> 27:05.304
Yes, what the fuck
I thought, bitch.

27:05.306 --> 27:07.338
I'd hate to mess with you.

27:08.876 --> 27:10.041
Do you wanna try?

27:10.043 --> 27:12.376
No. You know how much
I hate guns.

27:12.378 --> 27:13.444
Oh, it ain't gonna hurt.

27:13.446 --> 27:15.282
Please, Win, just put it away.

27:16.517 --> 27:18.116
Can we just live here?

27:18.118 --> 27:20.352
It's so much better
than your house.

27:20.354 --> 27:21.420
As long
as I'm with you,

27:21.422 --> 27:23.955
I don't care where we are.

27:23.957 --> 27:26.157
I'm gonna get you some shit
better than this, though.

27:26.159 --> 27:27.826
You know, I always wanted
to go to Florida.

27:27.828 --> 27:29.461
Where we'll get a little place
on the beach.

27:29.463 --> 27:31.930
- I've never been to the beach.
- Me, neither.

27:31.932 --> 27:33.298
If we keep making money
like this,

27:33.300 --> 27:34.866
we can head there by winter.

27:34.868 --> 27:36.835
I've never even been on a plane.

27:36.837 --> 27:39.137
Can you imagine
being so high up?

27:40.107 --> 27:42.143
Pick up all the sun
as far as it takes us.

27:44.411 --> 27:47.045
We're gonna look down
from that plane at everyone.

27:47.047 --> 27:48.850
So they ain't looking down
on us no more.

28:09.435 --> 28:11.138
Hey, baby.
Wanna go out?

28:21.382 --> 28:23.015
<i>Forty to suck you off.</i>

28:23.017 --> 28:25.017
<i>That's two hours,
set on $40 too.</i>

28:25.019 --> 28:27.055
<i>My pimp is right outside.
You got it?</i>

28:35.162 --> 28:37.461
So, how'd we do
last night?

28:37.463 --> 28:38.462
Just a couple
of blowjobs

28:38.464 --> 28:40.499
and an extra 20 someone gave me
to lick my ass.

28:40.501 --> 28:43.468
I don't want nobody putting
their mouths on my curves.

28:43.470 --> 28:45.369
I'm sorry, well,
it won't happen again.

28:45.371 --> 28:46.538
I don't want you catching shit.

28:46.540 --> 28:48.105
'Cause then,
you're no good to me.

28:48.107 --> 28:49.508
If a dude asks you
to stick some shit in,

28:49.510 --> 28:51.242
then they ain't right
in the mind.

28:58.519 --> 29:00.184
All right.

29:23.577 --> 29:25.243
Whoo-hoo.

29:25.245 --> 29:26.380
Kill 'em little mother...

29:32.552 --> 29:34.886
- This? Whatever.
- I'm hungry.

29:34.888 --> 29:36.121
I'm hungry too.

29:36.123 --> 29:37.890
- Ooh.
- Oh, no. Fifty. Fifty!

29:37.892 --> 29:39.892
That's mine. That's mine, bitch!

29:39.894 --> 29:41.159
- What did you do?
- Snap.

29:41.161 --> 29:43.261
Good goin'.

29:43.263 --> 29:45.564
Hey, Maria.
For the baby.

29:47.100 --> 29:48.232
Look, bitch.

29:48.234 --> 29:50.535
Oh, you got nothing
at me.

29:56.476 --> 29:58.111
Wednesday.

30:01.014 --> 30:03.582
Ooh, love. It's okay.

30:20.533 --> 30:22.401
Uh-huh.

30:22.403 --> 30:24.271
All right. All right.

30:36.983 --> 30:39.550
Who was that guy?

30:39.552 --> 30:42.019
Just somebody I know.
We were just catching up.

30:42.021 --> 30:43.355
I've been
at the house waiting on you.

30:43.357 --> 30:45.022
You was late. I had shit to do.

30:45.024 --> 30:46.657
Like what? I ain't
ever seen that car before.

30:46.659 --> 30:47.896
Bye.

30:49.062 --> 30:50.162
Who was he?

30:50.164 --> 30:51.229
Go away!

30:51.231 --> 30:52.267
Do you owe him money?

30:54.167 --> 30:55.969
You sucking him off for ice?

30:56.736 --> 30:58.135
Answer me!

30:58.137 --> 30:59.371
You don't trust me?

30:59.373 --> 31:00.372
I wanna trust you, Ma.

31:00.374 --> 31:02.410
So just open up the door
and let me talk to you.

31:36.010 --> 31:38.410
The last ho
that got up here was hot.

31:38.412 --> 31:40.045
You really overhyped it.

31:40.047 --> 31:41.313
You overhyped this shit.

31:41.315 --> 31:43.080
We're in the Bronx, y'all!

31:43.082 --> 31:45.483
Are we ready
for the hottest girl

31:45.485 --> 31:47.586
in fucking town?

31:47.588 --> 31:50.388
I know you'll put
your own money on here.

31:50.390 --> 31:52.156
Put your dongs together...

31:52.158 --> 31:53.592
That's some shit, man.

31:53.594 --> 31:54.759
...for Destiny!

32:39.874 --> 32:42.410
We need to find you
a girl like that.

34:02.755 --> 34:04.524
Did you know you gonna be
dancing for me tonight?

34:05.858 --> 34:07.791
Saw you lookin' at me.

34:07.793 --> 34:09.196
Did you like it?

34:10.362 --> 34:13.264
- Yeah.
- Turn around.

34:24.409 --> 34:27.911
I've never danced for anybody
who looks at me the way you do.

34:27.914 --> 34:29.550
'Cause there ain't nobody
like me.

34:30.617 --> 34:32.484
You are so sure

34:32.485 --> 34:34.217
of yourself, aren't you?

34:34.219 --> 34:36.188
If I wasn't would you be
so turned on right now?

34:48.234 --> 34:50.333
You got a price tag
for those eyes?

34:50.335 --> 34:51.469
Maybe.

34:51.472 --> 34:53.373
How about
the way you're lookin' at me?

34:54.341 --> 34:55.906
Oh, that's extra.

34:55.908 --> 34:57.875
Smart girl.

34:57.877 --> 34:59.611
You know your worth.

34:59.613 --> 35:01.245
So what you doing wasting
your energy in a club

35:01.247 --> 35:03.247
when you could be doing
bigger things with me?

35:03.249 --> 35:04.784
Well, you haven't asked me yet.

35:08.254 --> 35:09.486
What else
could you do?

35:09.488 --> 35:10.925
I don't think you can handle it.

35:12.693 --> 35:14.593
Close your eyes and show me.

36:04.944 --> 36:07.979
Man, she could be illegal
she's so damn fine.

36:07.981 --> 36:09.714
She got these niggas hypnotized.

36:10.984 --> 36:13.017
You got your ass hypnotized,
nigga.

36:13.019 --> 36:15.386
Yo dawg, our girl over here
sounds pussy-whipped.

36:15.388 --> 36:16.453
I ain't pussy-whipped.

36:16.455 --> 36:17.622
I'm thinkin'
about that business.

36:17.624 --> 36:20.325
I mean for real. How much
you think she pull a night?

36:20.327 --> 36:21.993
Can't keep up
with a hoe like that.

36:21.995 --> 36:24.296
Looked like she was falling
in love with me tonight, though.

36:25.731 --> 36:26.798
Well, you're right, though.
I saw the way

36:26.800 --> 36:27.899
she would clock at you.

36:27.901 --> 36:29.133
- Right, bruh.
- My daddy told me

36:29.135 --> 36:31.636
that dreams are for free but
the hustle's sold separately.

36:31.638 --> 36:33.772
That ass right there,
that's my future.

36:36.575 --> 36:37.741
Forget it.

36:37.743 --> 36:39.009
All right, all right. I guess,

36:39.011 --> 36:40.178
that sounded a little
pussy-whipped.

36:40.180 --> 36:42.546
Just saying, I saw your face
when her ass was up there,

36:42.548 --> 36:43.915
and you was like...

36:43.917 --> 36:45.417
I did not!

36:45.419 --> 36:46.551
- Hell, yeah.
- No.

36:46.553 --> 36:48.586
You're all just jealous
'cause she was looking at me.

36:53.392 --> 36:54.926
Beat that. Look.

36:54.928 --> 36:56.998
I got 50 bones...

36:57.930 --> 36:59.564
Wednesday's the man.

36:59.566 --> 37:01.098
Oh, yo. No, nah.

37:01.100 --> 37:03.935
I got a hundred.
Say's you can't beat that.

37:03.937 --> 37:04.939
Oh, yeah?

37:08.675 --> 37:10.040
Woo-hoo!

37:10.042 --> 37:11.776
Pay up, player.

37:11.778 --> 37:13.078
- Pay up. All right, shit.
- Fuck that.

37:13.080 --> 37:14.446
Hold on.

37:14.448 --> 37:15.616
All right.

37:17.450 --> 37:18.917
Hey, what's up. Who is this?

37:18.919 --> 37:20.054
<i>It's Destiny.</i>

37:20.854 --> 37:21.953
From the club.

37:21.955 --> 37:24.756
Oh, Destiny from the club.

37:24.758 --> 37:27.859
Oh, girl. So glad you called.
I've been thinking 'bout you.

37:27.861 --> 37:28.993
That's because you snuck off

37:28.995 --> 37:31.031
without letting me
finish my dance.

37:32.432 --> 37:34.064
I bet you're wondering
how it ends.

37:34.066 --> 37:36.066
<i>Glad you could read my mind.</i>

37:36.068 --> 37:37.267
Where you at?

37:37.269 --> 37:40.604
<i>Meet me at this hotel,
tomorrow night at ten.</i>

37:40.606 --> 37:41.908
I'll text you the address.

37:47.147 --> 37:48.613
Gonna take one for the team.

37:48.615 --> 37:50.615
Whoo! My motherfuckin' hero.

37:50.617 --> 37:51.783
- Aah!
- Ah, damn.

37:51.785 --> 37:52.651
Money!

37:52.653 --> 37:54.586
Oh, you ain't taking shit
pulling up

37:54.588 --> 37:55.919
in that broke-ass Dodge.

37:55.921 --> 37:56.921
Oh, shit. You don't...

37:56.923 --> 37:58.723
You think she gonna see
what I'm pulling up in?

37:58.725 --> 38:01.792
Hey! Don't worry, sis.
I got you.

38:01.794 --> 38:03.595
- What's this nigga talk about?
- Watch it.

38:06.466 --> 38:08.799
Oh, shit!

38:08.801 --> 38:10.167
- Hell yeah!
- That's it.

38:10.169 --> 38:12.703
Just got 'em. Plates is clean.

38:12.705 --> 38:14.638
When Destiny see you pull up
in this shit,

38:14.640 --> 38:17.345
she gonna know she fucking
with a real player.

38:17.810 --> 38:18.910
S'love.

38:18.912 --> 38:21.546
Oh, lotto. Can we check
the goods, too?

38:21.548 --> 38:23.180
You know it's not a good look
to have your,

38:23.182 --> 38:25.183
your boys running
the streets hungry.

38:25.185 --> 38:27.919
Every nigga I know is starving
even if he already ate.

38:27.921 --> 38:30.187
What a man gotta do to get
a little breakfast up in here?

38:30.189 --> 38:31.890
When a man find out,
let me know.

38:31.892 --> 38:33.558
I'm hungry, too.

38:33.560 --> 38:34.625
Holla!

38:42.135 --> 38:45.071
Oh, there she go.

38:50.676 --> 38:53.511
After tonight.

38:53.513 --> 38:55.113
What the fuck are they doing
in my car?

38:57.850 --> 39:00.551
I'm putting them to work.

39:00.553 --> 39:02.220
They need a little training
so I need you to teach them

39:02.222 --> 39:03.488
a thang or two.

39:03.490 --> 39:04.658
Oh, yeah? Like what?

39:05.725 --> 39:08.026
I don't know. Like...

39:08.028 --> 39:09.727
How I like my dick sucked.

39:09.729 --> 39:10.794
Fuck you.

39:11.897 --> 39:13.997
So you can just get rid of them
or I'm fucking gone.

39:13.999 --> 39:15.902
You need to lose
that attitude.

39:17.236 --> 39:18.638
This is work.

39:20.573 --> 39:22.573
I need you to teach them

39:22.575 --> 39:24.075
how things go around here.

39:24.077 --> 39:26.180
I'm thinking there's only room
for one at the top.

39:31.751 --> 39:33.250
Dude, they're fucking wearing
my shit...

39:44.930 --> 39:46.730
You need to check yourself.

39:46.732 --> 39:49.100
I think you're the one
who needs checking.

39:49.102 --> 39:51.803
You haven't even given me
my money from last month.

39:51.805 --> 39:52.906
Where the fuck is it?

39:54.039 --> 39:56.573
Are you spending it
on these hoes?

39:56.575 --> 39:58.877
You want me to prove how much
I love you

39:58.879 --> 39:59.944
and there's only you?

39:59.946 --> 40:01.879
Well, I'll shoot one
of these bitches right now.

40:01.881 --> 40:03.580
They don't mean shit to me.

40:03.582 --> 40:04.883
Fuck you, Kenny.
You're all talk.

40:04.885 --> 40:06.584
Okay? Put the fucking gun down.

40:06.586 --> 40:07.921
Maybe I shoot them both.

40:08.722 --> 40:09.821
Is it gonna be Blondie?

40:09.823 --> 40:11.122
Oh, shit.

40:11.124 --> 40:12.756
Oh, my god.

40:12.758 --> 40:13.793
Or Chocolate Love?

40:15.294 --> 40:16.361
Pick one.

40:16.363 --> 40:18.595
- Or I'll shoot them both.
- Oh, my god.

40:18.597 --> 40:20.064
I'll shoot you both.

40:20.066 --> 40:22.566
- Please.
- Oh, god! He's gonna kill us.

40:22.568 --> 40:23.667
- Call it.
- He's gonna kill us.

40:23.669 --> 40:25.069
Put the fucking gun down,
Kenny.

40:25.071 --> 40:26.970
- Blondie?
- Oh, my god.

40:26.972 --> 40:27.971
Chocolate Love?

40:27.973 --> 40:30.107
- What is he doing?
- Put the fucking gun down.

40:30.109 --> 40:31.975
Okay? You're fucking
scaring them.

40:31.977 --> 40:33.176
After all this time,

40:33.178 --> 40:35.747
you don't understand
how much you mean to me?

40:37.050 --> 40:39.250
No, no! Please.

40:39.252 --> 40:40.551
He's gonna shoot us!

40:40.553 --> 40:42.287
Oh, no. Not you, Blondie.

40:42.289 --> 40:43.754
You're way hotter
than Chocolate Love.

40:43.756 --> 40:45.756
- Fucking stop!
- No, no, no!

40:45.758 --> 40:47.225
No!

40:47.227 --> 40:49.930
- No!
- You're fucking crazy!

40:58.171 --> 41:00.738
- Fucking out of here!
- Oh, no.

41:00.740 --> 41:02.272
I love you.

41:02.274 --> 41:04.110
Don't make me put you down.

41:32.171 --> 41:35.675
Oh, stop eyeballing me like
I won't bash your head in.

41:40.113 --> 41:42.116
Pull your panty to the side.

41:55.327 --> 41:57.028
Here we go.

41:57.030 --> 42:00.832
You don't mean shit
to me.

42:05.104 --> 42:07.640
Hey, baby.
How much for that ass?

42:12.345 --> 42:14.812
Sweet ride. Man!

42:14.814 --> 42:17.180
It's fully loaded,
complete with tires.

42:17.182 --> 42:19.049
You know
what else it got?

42:19.051 --> 42:19.984
Heated seats for my girl

42:19.986 --> 42:22.220
and the best sound system
in the Bronx!

42:22.222 --> 42:24.055
Every time you kick it
with Science,

42:24.057 --> 42:25.890
you start talking
this VIP bullshit.

42:25.892 --> 42:26.957
- We can't afford this.
- Look.

42:26.959 --> 42:27.892
I know it's gonna sound crazy,

42:27.894 --> 42:29.694
but when an opportunity
comes in knocking,

42:29.696 --> 42:31.863
which it never does,
you gotta grab it.

42:31.865 --> 42:33.964
And last night,
I grabbed it hard.

42:33.966 --> 42:35.232
What do you mean?

42:35.234 --> 42:37.435
I ended up pulling the sickest
bitch from the club last night.

42:37.437 --> 42:39.703
And I mean dudes was draping
their lifesavers on her.

42:39.705 --> 42:41.305
But she only had her eyes
for me.

42:41.307 --> 42:42.807
So I brought me a private dance,

42:42.809 --> 42:43.875
tipped her a hundred bucks

42:43.877 --> 42:45.308
with my number on it
and then, bam!

42:45.310 --> 42:46.743
She hit on you?

42:46.745 --> 42:48.845
'Cause if she did,
I'm gonna fuck a bitch up.

42:48.847 --> 42:50.314
She didn't have to.

42:50.316 --> 42:51.448
I was already on it.

42:51.450 --> 42:53.153
So that's where you were
last night, huh?

42:53.852 --> 42:55.021
I'mma kill you.

42:56.022 --> 42:57.087
You think I'd put our dreams

42:57.089 --> 42:58.258
in the hands of just some bitch?

43:00.026 --> 43:02.093
I ain't gonna let you down.

43:02.095 --> 43:03.129
You better not.

43:05.131 --> 43:06.934
And let me hear the sound system
up in here.

43:07.300 --> 43:08.366
Man!

43:09.468 --> 43:11.703
- Hey, damn.
- Oh, oh, hey.

43:11.705 --> 43:13.337
Hey, hey, hey.

43:13.339 --> 43:14.404
Hey, hey.

43:34.861 --> 43:35.896
I'll be right out.

43:49.908 --> 43:51.776
This belong to me.

43:51.778 --> 43:53.511
It's my ass now. You got that?

43:53.513 --> 43:55.178
That's a lot of ass.

43:55.180 --> 43:56.948
You gotta show me
you can handle it.

43:56.950 --> 43:59.283
Ain't nobody gonna touch it
unless they speak to me.

43:59.285 --> 44:00.450
I'mma protect it.

44:00.452 --> 44:02.155
And I'mma use it
to make us some money.

44:03.856 --> 44:05.758
Just tell me how
we're gonna sell this hot shit.

44:06.859 --> 44:09.160
I got a phonebook
full of numbers

44:09.162 --> 44:11.129
with your name on it.

44:11.131 --> 44:13.096
You just gotta tell me
where to work it.

44:39.091 --> 44:41.491
I don't know
about this but that's...

44:44.964 --> 44:46.196
That's where we're goin'.

44:46.198 --> 44:47.265
Okay. See you later.

44:47.267 --> 44:48.899
- He's in here?
- We saw him.

44:48.901 --> 44:50.834
Best quarterback
the Giants ever had.

44:50.836 --> 44:52.203
Nigga, I'm telling you,
every dick-sucking hoe

44:52.205 --> 44:53.270
in the Bronx is on!

44:53.272 --> 44:55.272
So, so how much are we talking?

44:55.274 --> 44:56.908
Shit. Crowd like this?

44:56.910 --> 44:59.075
I'm thinking about three
to four G's in just a few hours.

44:59.077 --> 45:01.078
- Suck that.
- Yes.

45:04.450 --> 45:05.953
Yo, look at our girl go.

45:07.252 --> 45:10.120
She flossing like
the NFL boys be, right?

45:10.122 --> 45:12.089
Hey, I get to hit that for free,
right?

45:12.091 --> 45:13.890
After all nigga did
to hook it up.

45:13.892 --> 45:15.426
You know I'd kill you for it,
right?

45:15.428 --> 45:17.562
Shit.

45:17.564 --> 45:18.662
Yo, yo, yo!

45:18.664 --> 45:22.098
Yo, is this some Italian-made
Versace denim shit?

45:22.100 --> 45:23.433
You're in the wrong business,
nigga.

45:23.435 --> 45:24.502
And I've been telling you that.

45:24.504 --> 45:27.437
We got money, girls, sex.
What else do you need?

45:27.439 --> 45:28.872
Motherfucking food, nigga.

45:30.109 --> 45:31.875
Hey, Malcolm needs some chicken
wings every once in a while.

45:31.877 --> 45:34.544
Myself, I rather feed
on the pussy buffet.

45:34.546 --> 45:35.846
Nigga.

45:35.848 --> 45:36.948
Hell, yeah.

45:36.950 --> 45:38.482
Hey. But look, though.

45:38.484 --> 45:39.450
Win, with this kind of pimping,

45:39.452 --> 45:41.187
you're gonna need more than
an assistant.

45:41.955 --> 45:43.087
What?

45:43.089 --> 45:45.288
Hey, you're gonna really need
to protect your shit.

45:45.290 --> 45:46.357
It's like running in the streets

45:46.359 --> 45:47.924
with paper bags filled
with cash.

45:47.926 --> 45:50.026
You're gonna attract
the wrong niggas.

45:50.028 --> 45:51.562
So what do you think?
Like a bodyguard or some shit?

45:51.564 --> 45:52.629
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, yeah.

45:52.631 --> 45:53.900
Something like that.

46:06.111 --> 46:07.444
There wasn't much action.

46:07.446 --> 46:08.645
How'd you do, Maria?

46:08.647 --> 46:12.116
I did okay. I just hope
Wednesday's not mad.

46:12.118 --> 46:13.220
I don't know.

46:21.093 --> 46:22.993
What the fuck is this?

46:26.265 --> 46:28.935
This is only the beginning.

46:30.669 --> 46:33.504
- I'm gonna make you rich.
- Mm-hm.

46:33.506 --> 46:35.205
- Is that right?
- Mm-hm.

46:35.207 --> 46:36.573
So how rich are you
gonna make me?

46:36.575 --> 46:39.109
Well, I think
we can make millions.

46:39.111 --> 46:40.611
Millions?

46:40.613 --> 46:41.982
I like the sound of that.

46:59.932 --> 47:01.598
<i>Your call...</i>

47:26.325 --> 47:28.091
Ma, you're good?

47:28.093 --> 47:30.097
Just get me some water.

47:46.646 --> 47:48.645
You're burning up, Ma.

47:48.647 --> 47:50.314
- I'm fine.
- We gotta get you in the shower.

47:50.316 --> 47:51.749
Come on.

47:51.751 --> 47:53.316
Come on, let's get you
washed up now.

47:53.318 --> 47:54.384
All right, come on.

47:55.687 --> 47:57.323
I can do it myself.

48:17.142 --> 48:18.709
You're staying
off the drugs, Ma?

48:18.711 --> 48:21.379
I ain't touching nothing weird.

48:22.682 --> 48:24.017
Mom, you're sick.

48:25.618 --> 48:27.421
I'm sick and tired.

48:29.055 --> 48:30.323
You ain't lying to me, right?

48:31.156 --> 48:33.491
I ain't left the house.

48:33.493 --> 48:35.128
Just like you said.

48:38.131 --> 48:39.332
I believe you. You know that?

48:41.734 --> 48:44.504
And if you stay clean, we could
do things different this time.

48:53.745 --> 48:55.548
You look different.

49:00.819 --> 49:02.787
Just making money, Ma.

49:02.789 --> 49:04.154
Real money.

49:04.156 --> 49:06.158
What?

49:07.325 --> 49:09.095
You making money.

49:10.363 --> 49:12.229
What you gonna do
with all this money?

49:12.231 --> 49:13.196
I'mma take care of you.

49:13.198 --> 49:14.732
It's time for things
to change around here.

49:14.734 --> 49:16.299
You gonna buy me a new TV?

49:16.301 --> 49:17.767
Yeah, I already started looking
at better models.

49:17.769 --> 49:19.069
- Did ya?
- And I'mma get us

49:19.071 --> 49:20.738
a bigger house, too.

49:20.740 --> 49:22.372
How are you gonna do that?

49:22.374 --> 49:24.075
I got some new girls.

49:24.077 --> 49:25.442
Got a whole little hotel suite

49:25.444 --> 49:27.778
where everybody in Bronx
go to see 'em.

49:27.780 --> 49:29.649
You gonna be proud
if you saw 'em, Ma.

49:31.651 --> 49:33.651
I got game, Ma.

49:33.653 --> 49:35.386
It's only going up for me
from here.

49:35.388 --> 49:36.390
You hear me?

49:56.676 --> 49:59.310
What you mean
she ain't in the club?

49:59.312 --> 50:01.412
You tellin' me you can't keep
your eyes on one bitch for me?

50:02.881 --> 50:05.149
She ain't been home
for a few days.

50:05.151 --> 50:06.616
She ain't
returning calls.

50:06.618 --> 50:08.155
Shit. Ain't nobody seen her.

50:09.722 --> 50:11.122
You playing with me, dawg.

50:11.124 --> 50:13.591
No, boss. I heard she was
on a break.

50:13.593 --> 50:14.859
Who the fuck said that?

50:14.861 --> 50:17.828
One of the strippers. Said you
was the one who gave it to her.

50:17.830 --> 50:19.696
Nigga, go get Destiny right now.

50:19.698 --> 50:21.631
Bring her back here back here
before people start talking.

50:21.633 --> 50:23.399
I got niggas waiting on her.

50:23.401 --> 50:25.769
I'll get this city
on lock down, boss.

50:27.839 --> 50:30.573
And pull her back in her cage,

50:30.575 --> 50:32.646
or I'll kill all of you
motherfuckers.

50:47.727 --> 50:50.196
- What the fuck is this?
- It's Nikki. She's family.

50:52.430 --> 50:53.863
Bitch.

50:53.865 --> 50:55.601
The fuck was that?

50:56.368 --> 50:57.370
Hey!

50:58.403 --> 50:59.539
Hey!

51:01.740 --> 51:03.207
Hey, what's wrong with you?

51:03.209 --> 51:04.274
You should know better, okay?

51:04.276 --> 51:05.808
Don't mix me
with your street hoes.

51:05.810 --> 51:07.444
She one of my top girls,
like you.

51:07.446 --> 51:08.779
That's the problem, okay?

51:08.781 --> 51:10.613
There's only room for one
at the top.

51:10.615 --> 51:12.249
So what do you want me to do?

51:12.251 --> 51:13.584
Get rid of her.

51:13.586 --> 51:14.651
Or I'm gone, too.

51:14.653 --> 51:16.187
Hold up.

51:16.189 --> 51:17.720
I'm the one that makes the rules
around here.

51:17.722 --> 51:19.492
Fuck you, nigga bitch!

51:22.562 --> 51:24.131
It won't happen again.

51:25.932 --> 51:27.631
Yeah.

51:27.633 --> 51:29.202
Get your head straight.

51:38.510 --> 51:39.512
Hello.

51:42.414 --> 51:43.781
Hello.

51:43.783 --> 51:44.851
Hello.

52:21.354 --> 52:22.489
What do you want?

52:23.388 --> 52:24.787
Is Jamal here?

52:24.789 --> 52:25.891
Who the fuck are you?

52:28.760 --> 52:31.595
Tell him G Star's here.

52:31.597 --> 52:33.363
- Yo, Jamal.
- Yo.

52:33.365 --> 52:35.634
Some old bitch,
G Star is here to see you.

52:36.736 --> 52:37.837
You know her?

52:40.740 --> 52:42.274
Oh, shit.

52:42.874 --> 52:44.610
G Star in the building.

52:46.578 --> 52:47.781
What you doing in my hood?

52:51.383 --> 52:53.316
I tried to call you.

52:54.819 --> 52:56.423
Can you hook a sister up?

52:57.622 --> 52:59.857
It's been a long time, G.

52:59.859 --> 53:02.493
You know, you're one crazy bitch

53:02.495 --> 53:03.930
for coming
all the way down here.

53:04.997 --> 53:05.999
Come on.

53:19.678 --> 53:21.347
Hey, I'm trying to smoke.

53:22.682 --> 53:24.013
Can you unlock
the window?

53:24.015 --> 53:25.848
- What's the problem?
- You gonna be cool with that?

53:25.850 --> 53:27.886
Not if it's gonna mess
with my hair.

53:31.790 --> 53:34.491
I can't believe you're listening
to this bitch.

53:34.493 --> 53:36.526
You better teach this little
girl some manners, Wednesday.

53:36.528 --> 53:38.629
'Cause she needs to know
who's riding who over here.

53:40.332 --> 53:42.966
- You know, Win, fuck this bitch.
- Shut the fuck up, Nikki.

53:42.968 --> 53:44.435
Keep your mouth shut.
Destiny is right.

53:44.437 --> 53:45.538
You need to know your role.

53:47.707 --> 53:49.640
So that's how it is, huh?

53:49.642 --> 53:50.910
We'll talk about it later.

54:04.823 --> 54:06.459
So what you looking for, G?

54:07.359 --> 54:08.959
Same as last time.

54:08.961 --> 54:10.461
Same thing.

54:10.463 --> 54:11.828
Oh, no. I got some new shit
right here

54:11.830 --> 54:13.397
about to hit the streets.

54:13.399 --> 54:14.601
Why don't you try a speck?

54:17.937 --> 54:19.803
I, I don't have any money.

54:19.805 --> 54:21.875
No? Then you're in
the wrong fucking place.

54:22.841 --> 54:24.674
I can have it for you tomorrow.

54:24.676 --> 54:25.743
You know, first,

54:25.745 --> 54:26.913
- first thing, J.
- No.

54:28.546 --> 54:30.714
I'mma have it for you
first thing tomorrow.

54:30.716 --> 54:33.450
You're saying it like
back in the days, yo.

54:39.825 --> 54:41.060
Come on, J.

54:47.700 --> 54:48.768
Come on, J.

54:53.872 --> 54:55.772
I'll let you fuck me.

54:55.774 --> 54:56.776
What?

54:58.611 --> 55:01.580
I'll let you fuck me in the ass.

55:02.714 --> 55:05.682
Anything.

55:05.684 --> 55:06.685
Please.

55:08.586 --> 55:09.888
Okay, I'll call you later.

55:23.736 --> 55:25.538
- You serious right now?
- Don't start it.

55:26.939 --> 55:28.705
Are you fucking serious?

55:28.707 --> 55:29.772
What do you want me
to do, Nikki?

55:29.774 --> 55:30.776
What the fuck was that?

55:32.111 --> 55:33.580
Nikki! Nikki!

55:34.879 --> 55:36.048
Get back in the car.

55:38.551 --> 55:40.883
I can't believe you let
that bitch talk to me like that.

55:40.885 --> 55:42.586
What was I supposed
to do, Nikki?

55:42.588 --> 55:44.455
Kick her out the car?
What about our future?

55:44.457 --> 55:46.022
This is your future right here.

55:46.024 --> 55:47.457
You and me, remember?

55:47.459 --> 55:51.160
She's big money right now
and we need that.

55:51.162 --> 55:54.631
You think that money
is the answer to everything.

55:54.633 --> 55:57.667
That's your problem.
I see it different.

55:57.669 --> 55:59.502
I see how she looks at you.

55:59.504 --> 56:01.238
We out here doing big things.

56:01.240 --> 56:02.839
And to me,
you're just getting emotional

56:02.841 --> 56:04.644
and you need to keep
that shit to yourself.

56:05.910 --> 56:07.243
I love you, Win.

56:07.245 --> 56:08.714
I ain't even know that
right now.

56:09.714 --> 56:10.716
What?

56:11.684 --> 56:13.086
I'm your pimp, Nikki.

56:16.055 --> 56:17.154
Please.

56:17.156 --> 56:19.492
Bitch, are you fucking blind?
Huh?

56:21.794 --> 56:23.826
Get the fuck out of here, man.

56:23.828 --> 56:25.064
What about this?

56:30.669 --> 56:32.636
It's a phone.

56:32.638 --> 56:34.207
And I know it's worth something.

56:34.874 --> 56:36.107
I know you,

56:36.109 --> 56:38.741
you can get something for this.
It's, it's worth something.

56:38.743 --> 56:39.845
Here, take it.

56:41.881 --> 56:43.716
Take it. Take it.

56:57.729 --> 56:59.231
All right. This shit should hold
you through the night.

57:03.002 --> 57:05.004
This is the last fucking time
I'll hook you up.

57:13.879 --> 57:14.944
What is up with you?

57:14.946 --> 57:17.015
- Are you in love with that girl?
- Shut the fuck up!

57:17.950 --> 57:19.783
Shut the fuck up!

57:19.785 --> 57:22.021
Because you think you know shit
but you know nothing.

57:23.055 --> 57:24.223
Fuck you, Win.

57:27.593 --> 57:30.060
This is two Gs.

57:30.062 --> 57:32.729
And until you start making that
in a night,

57:32.731 --> 57:34.033
you need to keep
your mouth shut.

57:35.334 --> 57:36.633
And play your role, Nikki,

57:36.635 --> 57:38.701
so we can get what we need.

57:38.703 --> 57:40.303
It's just business.

57:40.305 --> 57:41.573
Remember?

57:44.709 --> 57:45.711
Get in the car.

57:48.046 --> 57:49.147
Get in the car!

57:58.923 --> 58:00.256
Blunted, right?

58:03.095 --> 58:04.227
That's nice.

58:06.064 --> 58:07.730
That's nice.

58:38.196 --> 58:40.263
Shit's crazy up in here, man.

58:40.265 --> 58:42.167
I can even die
if we sell this shit.

58:43.635 --> 58:46.035
Wednesday and I
are making money,

58:46.037 --> 58:48.707
and she's buying me everything
a girl can dream of.

58:50.242 --> 58:51.743
You think he misses me yet?

58:53.278 --> 58:54.944
Well, fuck him!

58:54.946 --> 58:57.180
All right? I'm never going
back to that.

58:57.182 --> 58:59.852
Stop talking shit
and get off that phone.

59:00.952 --> 59:02.354
Let me hit you back real quick.

59:04.356 --> 59:06.323
Who the fuck let you in here?

59:06.325 --> 59:08.924
I don't need anybody's
permission to be up in here.

59:08.926 --> 59:09.993
Didn't you see the sign
that said

59:09.995 --> 59:11.731
no street hoes up in here?

59:15.901 --> 59:17.334
Fuck you, bitch!

59:17.336 --> 59:18.769
Fuck you, bitch!

59:21.240 --> 59:23.372
Fuck you. Fuck...

59:23.374 --> 59:25.777
Fuck you, Nikki!

59:33.051 --> 59:34.187
Get off me!

59:42.928 --> 59:44.394
Wednesday's mine.

59:44.396 --> 59:45.796
You're just some whore we used

59:45.798 --> 59:47.863
to get where we wanna be.

59:47.865 --> 59:50.033
Nikki.

59:50.035 --> 59:51.901
What the hell
are you doing here?

59:51.903 --> 59:53.039
How could you?

59:59.278 --> 01:00:00.843
Nikki.

01:00:00.845 --> 01:00:02.279
Nikki.

01:00:02.281 --> 01:00:03.349
Nikki, wait!

01:00:04.415 --> 01:00:05.848
Nikki, wait!

01:00:05.850 --> 01:00:07.149
I told you
not to come around here.

01:00:07.151 --> 01:00:09.218
And now I know why.

01:00:09.220 --> 01:00:11.053
You promised that
there wouldn't be any secrets

01:00:11.055 --> 01:00:11.921
between us.

01:00:11.923 --> 01:00:13.423
Can you just please keep
your voice down?

01:00:13.425 --> 01:00:15.424
How can I keep my voice down

01:00:15.426 --> 01:00:18.030
when you're up in here spending
all of our money on her?

01:00:21.867 --> 01:00:23.301
I mean, look at you, Win...

01:00:24.435 --> 01:00:26.271
and your fancy suit.

01:00:29.807 --> 01:00:31.274
Who are you?

01:00:31.276 --> 01:00:32.345
Nikki...

01:00:44.957 --> 01:00:46.159
Ma'am, you need to wake up.

01:00:50.828 --> 01:00:51.897
Can you hear me?

01:00:52.497 --> 01:00:53.899
You need to wake up.

01:01:06.912 --> 01:01:08.245
See, Wednesday,
this is why I don't want

01:01:08.247 --> 01:01:11.113
your fucking street hoes
in here.

01:01:11.115 --> 01:01:13.051
You had me worried sick, girl.

01:01:16.053 --> 01:01:17.956
What's up with you
running off like that?

01:01:19.457 --> 01:01:21.924
Since when a girl
who got everything she want,

01:01:21.926 --> 01:01:23.292
everything she needs,

01:01:23.294 --> 01:01:25.030
this is how you show
your respect?

01:01:26.899 --> 01:01:29.001
What could be more important
than me?

01:01:30.202 --> 01:01:33.439
We're over, Kenny, okay?
Get the fuck out!

01:01:35.339 --> 01:01:37.040
Stupid.

01:01:37.042 --> 01:01:38.941
Dumbass bitch.

01:01:38.943 --> 01:01:41.076
See that's the...

01:01:41.078 --> 01:01:43.446
That's the problem
with these hoes.

01:01:43.448 --> 01:01:45.015
You give them too much room
to think,

01:01:45.017 --> 01:01:46.883
they start making decisions
for theirself.

01:01:46.885 --> 01:01:48.884
Fuck your shit up every time.

01:01:51.022 --> 01:01:52.892
Don't you know
you can never leave me?

01:01:54.359 --> 01:01:57.930
You can never... leave me.

01:02:02.434 --> 01:02:03.834
Pump your ass right now

01:02:03.836 --> 01:02:05.267
if it weren't for the money
you make me.

01:02:05.269 --> 01:02:06.472
Nigga, her grab her shit.

01:02:09.341 --> 01:02:10.443
Look.

01:02:14.078 --> 01:02:15.515
Just show me the money...

01:02:17.149 --> 01:02:19.318
- and then we're talking.
- Aah.

01:02:20.285 --> 01:02:21.988
So it is about the money.

01:02:25.289 --> 01:02:26.792
We the same girl.

01:02:29.928 --> 01:02:31.196
Who the fuck is this?

01:02:33.432 --> 01:02:34.867
Leave her alone, Ken.

01:02:36.334 --> 01:02:37.399
Look at this thing right here.

01:02:37.401 --> 01:02:39.502
What the fuck is you, girl?

01:02:39.504 --> 01:02:41.303
Look, Destiny's done
for the night.

01:02:41.305 --> 01:02:42.538
You all can go home.

01:02:42.540 --> 01:02:43.607
You...

01:02:48.046 --> 01:02:49.979
Oh, I like you, tiny.

01:02:49.981 --> 01:02:51.314
I like you,

01:02:51.316 --> 01:02:54.116
'cause you're so funny looking
in your pimp talk.

01:02:54.118 --> 01:02:55.919
Well, let me set this straight
right here.

01:02:55.921 --> 01:02:57.187
This here is my property.

01:02:57.189 --> 01:02:58.254
See...

01:02:58.256 --> 01:02:59.355
I own this.

01:02:59.357 --> 01:03:01.493
And you ain't ask my permission
if you can have her.

01:03:03.060 --> 01:03:05.060
What the fuck is you, anyway?

01:03:05.062 --> 01:03:06.328
Half girl, half nigga pimp?

01:03:06.330 --> 01:03:08.564
All girl, all nigga, all pimp.

01:03:08.566 --> 01:03:11.234
This is my territory.
You're fucking my shit now.

01:03:11.236 --> 01:03:12.238
I own this.

01:03:16.908 --> 01:03:18.010
Okay, okay.

01:03:19.144 --> 01:03:20.977
Let me ask you this, tiny.

01:03:20.979 --> 01:03:24.314
How a girl like you...

01:03:24.316 --> 01:03:27.616
fuck a woman like this?

01:03:27.618 --> 01:03:29.618
First, I fuck her with my mind.

01:03:29.620 --> 01:03:31.120
Then once I'm in her head,
I'm fucking her deeper

01:03:31.122 --> 01:03:32.191
than you've ever been.

01:03:33.624 --> 01:03:36.526
Men... always think
you need a dick to fuck.

01:03:36.528 --> 01:03:37.562
Ain't that right?

01:03:39.363 --> 01:03:41.363
Look, she's just here
to give me my money.

01:03:41.365 --> 01:03:42.598
Oh, I know.

01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:45.368
- What are you talking about?
- Go on and put on some clothes.

01:03:45.370 --> 01:03:46.435
Who are they?

01:03:46.437 --> 01:03:48.437
Grab some shit.

01:03:48.439 --> 01:03:51.073
Yeah. Destiny done this
some bad things

01:03:51.075 --> 01:03:52.911
but, see here, tiny...

01:03:54.578 --> 01:03:55.948
I'mma forgive her.

01:03:57.149 --> 01:03:58.647
As for you...

01:03:58.649 --> 01:03:59.651
Ahh.

01:04:02.086 --> 01:04:03.653
You can either work for me...

01:04:03.655 --> 01:04:04.720
or you can die.

01:04:04.722 --> 01:04:06.455
Fuck you.

01:04:06.457 --> 01:04:08.591
You go walking to my club,

01:04:08.593 --> 01:04:11.194
steal my hoe,

01:04:11.196 --> 01:04:13.366
and think you're gonna walk
out of here big pimpin'?

01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:17.002
Oh, you're lucky
you're walking home.

01:04:18.703 --> 01:04:20.069
You're just gonna leave?

01:04:20.071 --> 01:04:21.274
Thought we had a deal.

01:04:22.441 --> 01:04:24.274
You can send my love to Nikki.

01:04:24.276 --> 01:04:26.241
Hey, my boy gonna be really
gentle on you.

01:04:26.243 --> 01:04:28.211
Fuck you...

01:04:30.682 --> 01:04:33.116
Hey, your game ain't that bad
for a bitch.

01:04:33.118 --> 01:04:34.383
Good luck.

01:04:51.435 --> 01:04:53.336
You still pimping now, huh?

01:04:53.338 --> 01:04:54.738
Help!

01:04:54.740 --> 01:04:57.140
- You a pimp now, huh?
- Help!

01:05:20.399 --> 01:05:22.064
Count to ten.
Son of a bitch.

01:05:27.272 --> 01:05:29.605
Calm the fuck down,
piece of shit woman.

01:05:29.607 --> 01:05:31.609
And take those
fucking hands off.

01:05:33.044 --> 01:05:34.778
Where the fuck
are you going, woman, huh?

01:05:34.780 --> 01:05:36.314
Come here.

01:05:39.084 --> 01:05:40.352
You're fucking...

01:05:42.287 --> 01:05:44.421
Aah!

01:05:46.323 --> 01:05:48.792
You fucking shot me!

01:05:48.794 --> 01:05:50.826
Think I was gonna let you
fuck me?

01:06:19.156 --> 01:06:20.089
<i>What did you tell him?</i>

01:06:20.091 --> 01:06:21.290
<i>I didn't tell him anything.</i>

01:06:21.292 --> 01:06:22.691
- No, Nikki...
- I'm done!

01:06:22.693 --> 01:06:24.093
You need to think fast, Win.

01:06:24.095 --> 01:06:25.261
Once they find out you killed
that guy,

01:06:25.263 --> 01:06:26.495
they're gonna search
every street.

01:06:26.497 --> 01:06:27.696
It was Destiny.

01:06:27.698 --> 01:06:28.832
I heard her bragging
on the phone

01:06:28.834 --> 01:06:30.165
about this shit
you've been buying her

01:06:30.167 --> 01:06:31.301
with our money!

01:06:31.303 --> 01:06:33.169
Quit tripping, Nikki,
'cause it ain't even like that.

01:06:33.171 --> 01:06:34.636
Well, that's what it seems
like to me.

01:06:34.638 --> 01:06:36.605
I got played, all right?

01:06:38.743 --> 01:06:40.078
Sorry.

01:06:44.816 --> 01:06:46.149
What's going on, Win?

01:06:46.151 --> 01:06:47.216
Just go back to bed, Charlie.

01:06:47.218 --> 01:06:48.283
It's just a shit
I gotta deal with.

01:06:48.285 --> 01:06:49.252
It's okay, Charlie.
Come over here.

01:06:49.254 --> 01:06:50.886
Hide out here
with us for a little while.

01:06:50.888 --> 01:06:52.754
No, I can't do that to you
and the baby.

01:06:52.756 --> 01:06:54.256
She's right.

01:06:54.258 --> 01:06:55.558
We gotta get out of here.

01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:57.593
"We"? I'm the one
that got us into this shit.

01:06:57.595 --> 01:06:59.595
I'm the one that's gotta go.

01:06:59.597 --> 01:07:01.763
I said "we."
I ain't leaving without you.

01:07:01.765 --> 01:07:02.832
We can't leave.

01:07:02.834 --> 01:07:04.303
I ain't afraid of them.

01:07:06.604 --> 01:07:08.307
You gotta stick to the dream,
remember?

01:07:10.142 --> 01:07:11.674
You and me...

01:07:11.676 --> 01:07:13.511
this is the dream.

01:07:14.379 --> 01:07:15.548
Malcolm's here.

01:07:16.914 --> 01:07:18.480
- I'm gonna go get Ma.
- I'm coming with you.

01:07:18.482 --> 01:07:20.917
No, you and Science go get
our shit and the money.

01:07:20.919 --> 01:07:23.155
I got you.
Meet back here.

01:07:27.158 --> 01:07:28.160
Go.

01:07:29.693 --> 01:07:31.493
Win, no...

01:07:31.495 --> 01:07:32.664
What about us?

01:07:33.865 --> 01:07:35.468
Let's meet here after, Charlie.

01:07:37.535 --> 01:07:40.169
Maria, you're in charge now.

01:07:40.171 --> 01:07:41.236
It'll last you
a couple of weeks.

01:07:41.238 --> 01:07:42.205
You gotta figure it out.

01:07:42.207 --> 01:07:43.705
Do whatever you gotta do
to feed your family.

01:07:43.707 --> 01:07:46.341
- You understand?
- Are you leaving us, Win?

01:07:46.343 --> 01:07:47.410
Yeah.

01:07:47.412 --> 01:07:48.477
I ain't even worried
about y'all.

01:07:48.479 --> 01:07:49.514
Y'all gonna be fine.

01:07:53.584 --> 01:07:55.553
Now, go get me some clothes
so I can change.

01:07:56.588 --> 01:07:58.189
Go!

01:08:02.861 --> 01:08:04.426
Still checking
on your paperwork,

01:08:04.428 --> 01:08:05.528
she's in the cell
straight ahead.

01:08:05.530 --> 01:08:08.700
You only got 15 minutes.

01:08:12.836 --> 01:08:13.903
You all right?

01:08:13.905 --> 01:08:15.270
What does it look like to you?

01:08:15.272 --> 01:08:16.406
We'll get you out of here.

01:08:16.408 --> 01:08:17.473
I just gotta wait on them
to finish...

01:08:17.475 --> 01:08:18.340
What's taking you so long?

01:08:18.341 --> 01:08:20.210
I thought
she was making money now.

01:08:20.212 --> 01:08:21.577
Plan has changed.

01:08:21.578 --> 01:08:22.745
That's what I wanted to talk
to you about.

01:08:22.747 --> 01:08:23.883
So you got the money?

01:08:26.584 --> 01:08:28.483
Is that all you care about?

01:08:28.484 --> 01:08:29.986
I've just been through hell.

01:08:29.988 --> 01:08:31.653
Can we talk about this later?

01:08:31.654 --> 01:08:33.354
It is "later."

01:08:33.357 --> 01:08:34.590
How come
you're always lying to me?

01:08:34.591 --> 01:08:36.593
'Cause you will never want
to hear the truth.

01:08:36.595 --> 01:08:39.696
Ma, do you even care to ask
what happened to me?

01:08:39.698 --> 01:08:42.232
Well, you know,
if you got me out of here,

01:08:42.234 --> 01:08:43.499
then you know,
we can go talk about it.

01:08:43.501 --> 01:08:45.367
I'm in trouble.

01:08:45.368 --> 01:08:47.002
Big trouble. I shouldn't even
be here right now.

01:08:47.004 --> 01:08:48.804
You sitting there looking
at my busted face?

01:08:48.805 --> 01:08:51.407
Well, you know, I...
I just wanna go home right now.

01:08:51.408 --> 01:08:52.341
I'm sure
you can understand that.

01:08:52.343 --> 01:08:53.608
You said you wasn't doing
no more drugs.

01:08:53.609 --> 01:08:56.278
Where are you going with this?
Do you have the money or not?

01:08:56.279 --> 01:08:57.345
Yeah, I got the money.

01:08:57.348 --> 01:08:58.848
Everything, I got.

01:08:58.850 --> 01:09:01.517
But I'll ask you something.

01:09:01.519 --> 01:09:03.952
Do you even give
a shit about me?

01:09:03.953 --> 01:09:06.787
What kind of ques...
I know you not asking me...

01:09:06.790 --> 01:09:08.890
Are you serious?
Are you really asking me that

01:09:08.892 --> 01:09:09.759
- right now?
- Dead ass serious.

01:09:09.761 --> 01:09:12.464
Do you love me?
Did you ever love me?

01:09:19.537 --> 01:09:21.571
I can't love...

01:09:21.573 --> 01:09:22.908
when there's nothing in me.

01:09:24.743 --> 01:09:26.643
I'm just doing my best.

01:09:26.645 --> 01:09:29.348
I've loved you all my life.

01:09:30.714 --> 01:09:32.814
Everything I've done,
I've done for you.

01:09:32.816 --> 01:09:34.550
But you?

01:09:34.551 --> 01:09:35.852
You didn't give a shit about me.

01:09:35.854 --> 01:09:38.353
I don't give a shit about you?

01:09:38.354 --> 01:09:39.787
I don't give a shit about you?

01:09:39.790 --> 01:09:42.658
I sold my ass to put clothes
on your back.

01:09:42.660 --> 01:09:43.960
To put food on the table

01:09:43.962 --> 01:09:45.060
for you!

01:09:45.062 --> 01:09:47.063
Now, I may not have been
the best mother in the world

01:09:47.064 --> 01:09:49.465
'cause God knows I didn't intend
to be one,

01:09:49.466 --> 01:09:51.501
but sometimes, sometimes,
Wednesday,

01:09:51.502 --> 01:09:53.439
you don't get to live
the life you wanna live.

01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:56.575
So do you?

01:09:58.677 --> 01:09:59.942
Do you love me?

01:09:59.944 --> 01:10:01.946
I just wanna know that,
last thing.

01:10:03.748 --> 01:10:05.581
Do you love me?

01:10:05.583 --> 01:10:07.349
Do you love me?

01:10:07.351 --> 01:10:08.486
No!

01:10:09.387 --> 01:10:11.086
No!

01:10:11.088 --> 01:10:14.023
I don't love you.

01:10:14.025 --> 01:10:16.826
Now get me out of here

01:10:16.828 --> 01:10:18.564
so I can go home!

01:10:20.097 --> 01:10:21.699
You are home.

01:10:22.867 --> 01:10:24.701
At least I know where
to find you.

01:10:24.703 --> 01:10:26.402
I know people
are gonna feed you,

01:10:26.404 --> 01:10:28.504
I know you got a place
to lay your head.

01:10:28.506 --> 01:10:30.406
I ain't gotta worry
about you no more.

01:10:32.843 --> 01:10:35.344
I know you're not gonna leave me
locked up in here.

01:10:35.346 --> 01:10:38.747
I know you're not gonna leave me
locked up in this hellhole.

01:10:38.749 --> 01:10:40.515
What about all that shit
you was talking about

01:10:40.517 --> 01:10:41.584
the other night?

01:10:41.586 --> 01:10:43.353
How you was gonna
take care of me?

01:10:43.355 --> 01:10:45.354
What about all that? Huh?

01:10:45.356 --> 01:10:46.656
What about all that?

01:10:49.860 --> 01:10:51.029
I love you, Ma.

01:10:52.596 --> 01:10:53.898
I'mma pray for you.

01:10:57.135 --> 01:10:58.501
Go on!

01:10:58.503 --> 01:11:00.803
Go on, leave me
just like your daddy did.

01:11:00.805 --> 01:11:02.938
Leave me just like
your daddy did!

01:11:02.940 --> 01:11:04.475
Go ahead and leave!

01:11:07.979 --> 01:11:09.448
Wednesday!

01:11:11.015 --> 01:11:13.483
<i>Wednesday, come back here!</i>

01:11:13.485 --> 01:11:16.152
<i>You go ahead, Wednesday!
You leave me!</i>

01:11:16.154 --> 01:11:19.325
<i>You leave me! You leave me
just like your daddy did!</i>

01:11:19.891 --> 01:11:22.023
<i>You leave me!</i>

01:11:22.025 --> 01:11:24.562
<i>Go ahead, Wednesday. Leave me!</i>

01:11:31.168 --> 01:11:32.969
- You ready?
- But what about Mama?

01:11:32.971 --> 01:11:34.906
Just me and you.
Come on, y'all. Let's go.

01:11:36.841 --> 01:11:38.107
Hope the old lady can make it.

01:11:38.109 --> 01:11:39.108
I bet you a hundred bucks

01:11:39.110 --> 01:11:40.443
I'm gonna drive her right down
to the beach.

01:11:40.445 --> 01:11:42.612
I'm going with Win on this.

01:11:42.614 --> 01:11:43.845
You just follow us
to the interstate

01:11:43.847 --> 01:11:44.882
till you're safe.

01:11:50.855 --> 01:11:52.091
Don't look back.

01:12:14.812 --> 01:12:16.481
You know, I ain't mad
at you, Win.

01:12:22.153 --> 01:12:23.655
I love you, Win.

01:12:26.857 --> 01:12:28.023
Oh, shit!

01:12:32.797 --> 01:12:33.929
Get down, Nikki!

01:12:39.837 --> 01:12:41.439
Fuck you!

01:12:50.181 --> 01:12:51.450
Get your ass around!

01:13:07.131 --> 01:13:08.200
Holy shit!

01:13:13.805 --> 01:13:15.871
- Run, Malcolm!
- No!

01:13:15.873 --> 01:13:17.773
- Oh, shit.
- Malcolm!

01:13:19.843 --> 01:13:21.810
Oh, shit!

01:13:21.812 --> 01:13:24.482
- Where you going?
- Don't be afraid. I got you.

01:13:31.055 --> 01:13:32.220
Oh.

01:13:47.805 --> 01:13:49.975
Bang! Bang!

01:13:50.775 --> 01:13:51.840
Bang!

01:14:20.070 --> 01:14:21.304
Stop.

01:14:21.306 --> 01:14:24.042
Help. Wait...

01:14:25.577 --> 01:14:26.578
Come on!

01:14:32.816 --> 01:14:34.720
Science, we gotta get up.

01:14:36.788 --> 01:14:38.987
Come on, man.

01:14:38.989 --> 01:14:41.823
- Come on, man. We gotta get up.
- Fuck you, man.

01:14:47.899 --> 01:14:50.066
You know you dropped
your gun, young blood.

01:14:50.068 --> 01:14:52.367
Science!

01:14:52.369 --> 01:14:53.669
Science!

01:14:53.671 --> 01:14:55.971
Don't you know
bitches can't be pimps?

01:14:55.973 --> 01:14:57.743
Fuck you, motherfucker!

01:14:59.142 --> 01:15:01.012
You did real good for a bitch.

01:15:04.615 --> 01:15:05.915
You did real good.

01:15:05.917 --> 01:15:07.148
Fuck you!

01:15:09.153 --> 01:15:10.752
Fuck y'all.

01:15:23.368 --> 01:15:25.166
- Come on, come on.
- No.

01:15:25.168 --> 01:15:27.202
Come on. Let's go.

01:15:27.204 --> 01:15:28.906
Come on. Come on.

01:15:29.841 --> 01:15:31.206
Come on.

01:15:53.998 --> 01:15:55.834
I'm sorry.

01:16:49.020 --> 01:16:51.056
Come on, Nikki. Come with me.

01:16:52.323 --> 01:16:54.255
Where are we going, Win?

01:16:54.257 --> 01:16:56.694
Don't be afraid. I got you.

01:16:59.396 --> 01:17:01.432
- Me and you.
- Me and you.

01:17:14.044 --> 01:17:16.815
Me and you, baby.

01:17:36.967 --> 01:17:39.068
<i>My daddy told me...</i>

01:17:39.070 --> 01:17:41.039
<i>Never let a bitch get close
to your heart.</i>

01:17:42.906 --> 01:17:44.208
<i>What he didn't know is...</i>

01:17:45.309 --> 01:17:49.077
<i>that bitch is money.</i>

01:17:49.079 --> 01:17:52.081
<i>And I'mma tell him
when I see him.</i>

01:17:52.083 --> 01:17:55.518
<i>Truth is... money
is the biggest bitch</i>

01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:56.553
<i>you're gonna ever hustle.</i>

01:17:56.555 --> 01:17:58.987
<i>And if you're living
chasing that,</i>

01:17:58.989 --> 01:18:00.391
<i>you might as well be dead.</i>

01:18:01.492 --> 01:18:03.459
<i>In the end,</i>

01:18:03.461 --> 01:18:06.327
<i>we're all pimps in this life.</i>

01:18:06.329 --> 01:18:09.532
<i>You just gotta be clear
on what you're hustling.</i>

01:18:09.534 --> 01:18:11.770
<i>And the one thing
you can't hustle...</i>

01:18:13.171 --> 01:18:14.439
<i>is love.</i>

01:18:15.472 --> 01:18:17.072
<i>It's the light in this life</i>

01:18:17.074 --> 01:18:18.910
<i>even when we're living
in the dark.</i>

01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:24.049
<i>I love you, Nikki.</i>

01:18:25.949 --> 01:18:27.485
<i>I'll see you in the next life.</i>
