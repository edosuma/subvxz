WEBVTT

00:05.268 --> 00:07.095
Move.

00:13.175 --> 00:14.302
Look.

00:17.208 --> 00:18.361
That's her.

00:18.364 --> 00:20.541
As far as I can tell, she's
right-hand to the Witness.

00:20.544 --> 00:23.645
She drugged Cassie, hunted me and Ramse.

00:23.646 --> 00:24.912
I guess she survived Jennifer.

00:24.914 --> 00:26.514
And barely aged a day.

00:26.516 --> 00:29.584
Ramse must've found her
before Titan splintered,

00:29.586 --> 00:32.619
dragged her back here
all the way from Colorado.

00:32.622 --> 00:34.288
Wait, Mr. Cole.

00:34.290 --> 00:36.224
- It's Ramse.
- Yes.

00:36.226 --> 00:40.428
But we need to know
which Ramse is in there.

00:40.431 --> 00:43.821
The grieving father? The loyal friend?

00:43.823 --> 00:46.324
Or the man who spent decades

00:46.326 --> 00:48.626
taking orders from that very woman?

00:48.628 --> 00:50.361
Come on, brother!

00:50.363 --> 00:51.629
Open up!

00:51.631 --> 00:53.164
Truthfully, Mr. Cole,

00:53.166 --> 00:54.899
could you tell the difference?

00:54.901 --> 00:56.400
We came a long way.

00:56.402 --> 00:59.203
You either want her, or you don't!

00:59.205 --> 01:01.839
No doubt, Mr. Ramse is
one hell of a hunter,

01:01.841 --> 01:04.375
but I need to know who caught who.

01:07.113 --> 01:08.479
Okay.

01:21.327 --> 01:22.960
Jonesy...

01:22.962 --> 01:26.063
whatever you do, know this.

01:26.065 --> 01:29.167
That is not a woman. It's a chameleon.

01:29.169 --> 01:32.770
Whatever you see is what
she wants you to see.

01:32.772 --> 01:34.572
And if she smiles at you,

01:34.574 --> 01:36.340
it's because she wants you dead.

01:38.478 --> 01:40.978
That isn't someone
who's ever been anywhere

01:40.980 --> 01:42.814
she didn't wanna be.

01:46.486 --> 01:47.985
Ramse's secure.

01:47.987 --> 01:49.821
What do you wanna do with her?

01:49.823 --> 01:52.356
We got the daughter set up in solitary.

01:52.358 --> 01:55.326
Fresh out of cells.

01:55.328 --> 01:56.694
Then build her one.

03:52.679 --> 03:54.745
Where's Cole?

03:54.747 --> 03:57.848
I never had a sibling.

03:57.850 --> 03:59.650
I never wanted one.

03:59.652 --> 04:02.586
All that trust.

04:02.588 --> 04:03.854
Until I had Hannah,

04:03.856 --> 04:06.524
I thought family just makes you foolish.

04:06.526 --> 04:07.892
Here we go again.

04:07.894 --> 04:10.094
I need to be able to not believe you,

04:10.096 --> 04:13.597
and that's impossible for
a man who calls you brother.

04:15.335 --> 04:18.336
So... shall we?

04:21.474 --> 04:23.741
I saw her at Titan.

04:23.743 --> 04:27.611
Whole place went up in smoke,

04:27.613 --> 04:29.680
and there she was,

04:29.682 --> 04:31.315
like she was just waiting for it.

04:31.317 --> 04:33.617
- Or you.
- How would I know?

04:33.619 --> 04:36.887
You did work with her
for a quarter century,

04:36.889 --> 04:39.390
helped her profit off history.

04:39.392 --> 04:43.027
Markridge, the plague, Project Splinter.

04:43.029 --> 04:45.429
I'd say you know her better than most.

04:45.431 --> 04:48.265
She broke off from them in 2016,

04:48.267 --> 04:51.135
and her and the Witness have
been in a dogfight ever since.

04:51.137 --> 04:53.738
Well, then she had 30
years to knock on our door.

04:53.740 --> 04:55.873
Or maybe it's bullshit,

04:55.875 --> 04:59.744
but it's bullshit that I
thought you should know.

04:59.746 --> 05:04.582
Mr. Ramse, this place is
so steeped in bullshit.

05:04.584 --> 05:07.752
It's the truth that I
find hardest to believe.

05:07.754 --> 05:10.721
I gave you the enemy of your enemy

05:10.723 --> 05:13.724
giftwrapped in a bow.

05:13.726 --> 05:15.593
Could I see my friend now?

05:17.930 --> 05:20.164
After all you've done, huh?

05:20.166 --> 05:22.233
After all that we've done to each other.

05:22.235 --> 05:25.369
Come on, you and I know better.

05:26.672 --> 05:29.874
My friend's friend
is no more trustworthy

05:29.876 --> 05:31.675
than my enemy's enemy.

05:38.684 --> 05:40.985
Sam's dead.

05:42.655 --> 05:46.223
She found him 20 years ago.

05:46.225 --> 05:48.793
The Witness was after her, and...

05:50.663 --> 05:52.630
He got caught in the middle.

05:55.535 --> 05:57.935
- Mr. Ramse, I'm...
- No, no, no, no, no.

05:57.937 --> 06:00.337
You don't get to apologize, lady.

06:05.178 --> 06:07.111
You got your kid back, right?

06:09.048 --> 06:12.583
I lost mine.

06:12.585 --> 06:14.418
Twice.

06:16.622 --> 06:21.826
I bury my boy every day.

06:21.828 --> 06:24.295
And I'm tired.

06:24.297 --> 06:25.596
I'm not afraid of dying,

06:25.598 --> 06:28.232
because I know I got it coming to me.

06:28.234 --> 06:30.434
I do. I know that.

06:33.272 --> 06:37.741
Not until I get the Witness.

07:00.333 --> 07:02.032
I hear you're out of a job.

07:02.034 --> 07:05.669
I was wondering who
would come to me first.

07:05.671 --> 07:10.040
You, Katarina, Cassie.

07:12.245 --> 07:16.013
How is Dr. Railly these days?

07:17.517 --> 07:20.151
Did you notice the sky
when you came in here?

07:20.153 --> 07:21.886
Clear blue.

07:21.888 --> 07:24.522
Leaves are green, no Red Forest.

07:24.524 --> 07:27.491
Looks like the Witness didn't
come through for ya after all.

07:27.493 --> 07:29.894
The upper hand doesn't suit you.

07:31.998 --> 07:36.867
So he pushed you out...

07:36.869 --> 07:39.003
left you for dead,

07:39.005 --> 07:41.572
and now you want the Witness.

07:41.574 --> 07:44.141
So maybe for the first time,

07:44.143 --> 07:46.243
we both want the same thing.

07:46.245 --> 07:48.245
It's been decades since I've seen you,

07:48.247 --> 07:51.315
but your eyes...

07:51.317 --> 07:54.218
they're much older.

07:54.220 --> 07:56.754
Why don't we talk about Titan?

07:56.756 --> 07:58.889
You've been chasing it, haven't you?

07:58.891 --> 08:01.225
To the very edge of time?

08:01.227 --> 08:03.794
Only now, you're an
inch from falling over.

08:06.432 --> 08:08.532
How long are we gonna
keep doing this, huh?

08:08.534 --> 08:11.101
Me and you, back and forth?

08:11.103 --> 08:13.671
That's your problem, James.

08:13.673 --> 08:15.506
You imagine that we're equals.

08:15.508 --> 08:18.008
- Where's Titan?
- You're not an adversary.

08:18.010 --> 08:22.246
You're an annoyance, like a
drum that won't stop drumming.

08:22.248 --> 08:23.747
You keep asking, "Where is Titan?"

08:23.749 --> 08:28.018
But what you really
mean is, "Where is she?"

08:28.020 --> 08:29.420
So tell me.

08:29.422 --> 08:31.121
You'll upend the tables of history

08:31.123 --> 08:33.190
to save the ones you love.

08:33.192 --> 08:35.192
But me, you left behind.

08:37.029 --> 08:39.863
You really don't remember?

08:39.865 --> 08:41.332
Remember what?

08:41.333 --> 08:43.100
How I was made.

08:44.971 --> 08:47.571
I was raised in a box.

08:47.573 --> 08:51.609
I was bled, I was tested.

08:51.611 --> 08:55.446
Then one day, I was set
free and fooled into another.

08:55.448 --> 08:57.147
They called it a cycle.

08:57.149 --> 08:59.383
All it really was?

08:59.385 --> 09:02.152
Just another box.

09:02.154 --> 09:04.388
- Berlin.
- 1961.

09:04.390 --> 09:06.390
This is the girl.

09:06.392 --> 09:08.192
Kirschner's test subject.

09:08.194 --> 09:10.294
It would certainly
explain her appearance,

09:10.296 --> 09:11.795
despite her age.

09:11.797 --> 09:13.697
Run a full battery on her.

09:13.699 --> 09:15.899
Blood, saliva, hair, skin, everything.

09:15.901 --> 09:17.067
Go.

09:17.069 --> 09:19.136
You left me to them.

09:19.138 --> 09:21.438
You fed me to the Witness

09:21.440 --> 09:24.475
and his promise of a timeless forest.

09:24.477 --> 09:28.746
And I believed him, like a fool,

09:28.748 --> 09:31.148
until I saw the lie.

09:31.150 --> 09:34.118
What lie?

09:34.120 --> 09:35.853
Mr. Cole?

09:40.293 --> 09:42.226
You, James.

09:42.228 --> 09:45.529
All the shots not
taken, knives not drawn.

09:45.531 --> 09:48.432
All the times we could've
killed you and didn't.

09:48.434 --> 09:51.335
Yet you never asked the question,

09:51.337 --> 09:53.203
"Why?"

09:53.205 --> 09:55.906
If I could kindly take a sample?

10:02.682 --> 10:05.049
Katarina would like a word.

10:11.123 --> 10:13.190
James...

10:13.192 --> 10:15.159
I wouldn't worry about Cassandra.

10:16.462 --> 10:19.330
Nothing stays in a box forever.

10:31.368 --> 10:32.643
Thank you.

10:42.822 --> 10:45.489
Ah, shit.

10:45.491 --> 10:47.991
I'm sorry I killed you. Go!

10:53.933 --> 10:54.965
Ah!

11:22.361 --> 11:23.761
Why?

11:26.565 --> 11:29.199
Talking won't heal you,

11:29.201 --> 11:31.368
only time.

11:31.370 --> 11:33.404
You're alone here,

11:33.406 --> 11:36.006
my secret to keep...

11:36.008 --> 11:38.108
from your friends

11:38.110 --> 11:40.344
and from your enemies.

11:40.346 --> 11:43.914
And I am neither.

12:06.472 --> 12:10.674
Well, I'm not gonna lie and
say I've seen worse, Teddy.

12:15.548 --> 12:17.047
Might be time to punch the old clock,

12:17.049 --> 12:20.184
if you know what I mean.

12:20.186 --> 12:22.352
How are you here?

12:22.354 --> 12:24.788
You're dying, son.

12:24.790 --> 12:27.357
Where the hell else would I be?

12:29.995 --> 12:31.995
Dad?

12:39.349 --> 12:41.543
Hey!

12:41.545 --> 12:42.911
Hey!

12:42.913 --> 12:46.882
Can anybody hear me, God damn it?

12:46.884 --> 12:50.452
Hey!

12:52.556 --> 12:54.156
Ouch.

12:54.158 --> 12:55.824
You look worse for wear, kid...

12:57.394 --> 13:00.229
But you wear it well,
just like your old man.

13:05.069 --> 13:08.604
You sure? 'Cause nothing's free.

13:08.606 --> 13:12.608
You give something
'cause you want something.

13:12.610 --> 13:14.487
Do you remember that guy on Wilmont?

13:14.490 --> 13:16.323
The strung-out scumbag type?

13:16.326 --> 13:18.647
One day, you and your
brother come running up to me,

13:18.649 --> 13:21.383
and you tell me that he
said something dirty to you.

13:21.385 --> 13:23.051
So halfway through the beating,

13:23.053 --> 13:24.820
he is screaming, swearing up and down.

13:24.822 --> 13:27.198
He didn't say shit, and
I'm starting to believe him.

13:27.201 --> 13:30.025
But I'm thinking, "Why
would you lie to me?"

13:30.027 --> 13:32.561
Then it clicked.

13:32.563 --> 13:35.065
It was your ma's birthday. I
didn't have anything for her.

13:35.068 --> 13:37.366
I just got fired from the
plant, so I was on edge.

13:37.368 --> 13:38.867
I was making fists.

13:38.869 --> 13:43.105
So you made up that story,
so that I would focus on him

13:43.107 --> 13:46.842
and not your brother and not your ma.

13:46.844 --> 13:49.077
What's your point?

13:51.415 --> 13:53.782
He was weak... a junkie.

13:53.784 --> 13:55.851
A weak man is vulnerable.

13:55.853 --> 13:59.988
A man like that is
the pawn of other men.

14:04.261 --> 14:05.928
Don't be weak.

14:41.765 --> 14:43.765
Why are you doing this?

14:43.767 --> 14:46.068
One day...

14:46.070 --> 14:48.403
far from now,

14:48.405 --> 14:50.138
you'll be called upon.

14:57.581 --> 14:59.848
Wake up!

14:59.850 --> 15:01.883
Is... is this your big plan?

15:01.885 --> 15:03.452
Big-shot Scav King?

15:03.454 --> 15:07.256
You're gonna lie down
and cough up blood?

15:07.258 --> 15:09.524
- Touch me again.
- Or what?

15:09.526 --> 15:11.126
I never liked you so much

15:11.128 --> 15:13.562
as the day you started hitting back.

15:16.066 --> 15:17.966
Go ahead.

15:17.968 --> 15:21.603
Bleed out, slip away.

15:21.605 --> 15:25.974
Whatever he is saving you
for, it ain't Christmas.

15:25.976 --> 15:27.509
You're too damn weak for him,

15:27.511 --> 15:30.145
and you sure as shit
ain't strong enough for me.

15:56.607 --> 15:58.473
It's unnatural.

15:58.475 --> 16:00.776
No one should have strength like this.

16:00.778 --> 16:03.812
This isn't science.
It... it's witchcraft.

16:03.814 --> 16:07.349
Her blood contains a dormant
form of the Kalavirus.

16:07.351 --> 16:09.384
It gives her immunity to the plague.

16:09.386 --> 16:12.054
Ms. Kirschner is a perfect variation

16:12.056 --> 16:14.256
of the Messenger genome.

16:14.258 --> 16:17.659
- Impeccably constructed.
- Mm.

16:17.661 --> 16:22.030
We do seem flush with
unusual specimens lately.

17:13.517 --> 17:16.484
Is there anything I can get for you?

17:16.487 --> 17:18.053
Blanket, perhaps?

17:18.055 --> 17:19.387
Thank you, no.

17:19.390 --> 17:21.256
I'm strangely never more uncomfortable

17:21.258 --> 17:23.358
than when I'm comfortable.

17:23.359 --> 17:27.695
It's the quiet moments that
frighten me the most, I think.

17:27.698 --> 17:28.864
Women like us,

17:28.866 --> 17:32.267
we prefer the storm
to the calm before it.

17:32.269 --> 17:34.703
Do you know what a golem is?

17:34.705 --> 17:38.507
Yeah. A children's tale, no?

17:38.509 --> 17:40.876
A delicate figure, shaped from clay,

17:40.878 --> 17:43.311
brought to life by a single breath.

17:43.313 --> 17:46.081
Back then, my father would read to me,

17:46.083 --> 17:47.816
always through the glass.

17:47.818 --> 17:51.086
On my loneliest days, I
would try to breathe life

17:51.088 --> 17:53.255
into my animals and dolls.

17:53.257 --> 17:55.390
They never spoke back.

17:55.392 --> 17:59.161
Father made his golem out of DNA.

17:59.163 --> 18:01.430
You made yours out of metal.

18:01.432 --> 18:03.765
Is that what you think I'm doing here?

18:03.767 --> 18:07.202
- Playing God?
- Playing God lacks ambition.

18:07.204 --> 18:10.672
Why play at something when
you can simply become it?

18:10.674 --> 18:12.574
You were made to be humble, I see.

18:12.576 --> 18:14.042
May I?

18:23.987 --> 18:25.921
Careful.

18:28.725 --> 18:30.592
What would you have made Hannah to be?

18:30.594 --> 18:32.160
Had you raised her?

18:32.162 --> 18:37.265
I'd be very careful not to
mention my daughter again.

18:37.267 --> 18:40.335
What exactly is it you want?

18:40.337 --> 18:44.406
I've been running a long
while in a single direction,

18:44.408 --> 18:46.174
forward in time.

18:46.176 --> 18:47.576
I know the feeling.

18:47.578 --> 18:50.011
Tomorrow is a poor place to hide.

18:50.013 --> 18:52.848
But yesterday?

18:52.850 --> 18:57.219
I want a moment in the
past, someplace civilized,

18:57.221 --> 19:00.722
free of you and safe from him.

19:00.724 --> 19:02.757
Give me your machine,
I'll give you the Witness.

19:05.128 --> 19:07.896
If you gave me the Witness,
you wouldn't need to run.

19:07.898 --> 19:10.732
What would you do? Send
James back to kill him?

19:10.734 --> 19:13.568
He has an awful habit of
creating the very problems

19:13.570 --> 19:15.570
he sets out to solve.

19:15.572 --> 19:17.572
Why did you abandon the Witness?

19:17.574 --> 19:20.675
He gave me a purpose, but it was a lie.

19:20.677 --> 19:24.212
This is no Red Forest, is it?

19:24.214 --> 19:25.580
So I left,

19:25.582 --> 19:28.250
tried to live a life without purpose,

19:28.252 --> 19:32.687
be normal, ordinary.

19:32.689 --> 19:38.193
But the world felt small, fragile.

19:38.195 --> 19:40.762
Surely, you understand.

19:40.764 --> 19:41.763
Do I?

19:41.765 --> 19:43.999
The marriage and life you left behind,

19:44.001 --> 19:47.035
you did all that in the name of purpose.

19:47.037 --> 19:48.603
You weren't made for anything else,

19:48.605 --> 19:50.839
- certainly not to be a mother.
- I warned you.

19:50.841 --> 19:53.508
Only in losing Hannah did
you find your true purpose.

19:53.510 --> 19:56.044
Tell me, Katarina,

19:56.046 --> 19:58.713
that you didn't love the
purpose more than the girl.

19:58.715 --> 20:00.582
Mention her one more time...

20:00.584 --> 20:03.685
Dr. Railly's gone. James, on his way.

20:03.687 --> 20:06.621
And Hannah's found
herself another mother.

20:06.623 --> 20:09.190
Everything you built
is broken, Katarina.

20:09.192 --> 20:12.160
Everything you built
belongs to somebody else.

20:21.405 --> 20:24.172
Dr. Adler, prepare the machine.

20:24.174 --> 20:25.086
Katarina?

20:25.089 --> 20:27.676
Our guest is hoping to take a trip.

20:27.678 --> 20:29.878
Let's not be inhospitable.

20:32.616 --> 20:35.717
She doesn't look like much, I know.

20:35.719 --> 20:38.019
But function?

20:39.189 --> 20:41.690
My machine takes but
a fraction of a second

20:41.692 --> 20:43.658
to deconstruct the human body,

20:43.660 --> 20:44.993
yet it takes the brain

20:44.995 --> 20:47.195
roughly twice as long to process pain.

20:47.197 --> 20:50.231
In short, the subject
is pieced back together

20:50.233 --> 20:55.470
before it can feel the agony
of having been torn apart.

20:55.472 --> 20:59.107
Unless I decrease the relay speed.

20:59.109 --> 21:02.844
In that case, it opens a window for...

21:02.846 --> 21:06.047
well, you'll see.

21:09.319 --> 21:10.652
Have a wonderful trip.

21:10.654 --> 21:12.253
Katarina, don't.

21:12.255 --> 21:15.290
- Decrease the relay speed.
- Disengaging the safeguards.

21:15.292 --> 21:19.194
Put her on a perpetual
one-second loop forward.

21:19.196 --> 21:24.332
Let her feel precisely why
we call it "splintering."

22:04.175 --> 22:06.241
I'm a little confused.

22:06.243 --> 22:10.579
I thought you were some
kind of Mad Max tough guy.

22:10.581 --> 22:12.748
West VII, 300 strong.

22:12.750 --> 22:14.683
Yeah, I thought you were dead.

22:14.685 --> 22:16.385
I saw you under that sheet.

22:16.387 --> 22:18.887
Points for style, right?

22:18.889 --> 22:22.124
Halfway through the windshield,

22:22.126 --> 22:24.893
bottle still in your hand.

22:24.895 --> 22:26.362
I was not impressed.

22:26.364 --> 22:30.099
If I'm dead, what the hell are you?

22:32.169 --> 22:35.003
You think you've found
some kind of redemption.

22:35.005 --> 22:38.307
From what? A woman?

22:38.309 --> 22:41.510
No. This is Hell.

22:43.547 --> 22:46.415
This is what we deserve.

22:51.255 --> 22:53.355
Nothing's free, Teddy.

22:53.357 --> 22:56.425
Bad men always want something.

22:56.427 --> 23:00.028
And you know, because you're a bad man.

23:12.576 --> 23:15.444
Oh.

23:36.934 --> 23:40.235
- Katarina...
- Continue, Dr. Adler.

23:49.046 --> 23:51.713
She doesn't like it, not one bit.

23:51.715 --> 23:54.416
It's hurting her. It's awful.

23:54.418 --> 23:57.653
- No one deserves...
- I'm not talking about Olivia.

23:57.655 --> 24:00.622
The machine.

24:00.624 --> 24:02.191
My mother.

24:02.193 --> 24:05.027
They called her Dr. Grimm.

24:13.137 --> 24:17.906
Are we quite finished
giving airs, Ms. Kirschner?

24:19.210 --> 24:22.678
Perhaps we can discuss your new purpose,

24:22.680 --> 24:24.813
telling us everything
you know of the Witness.

24:28.185 --> 24:31.820
Kirschner was my father's name.

24:31.822 --> 24:34.122
Mr. Lasky, again.

24:34.124 --> 24:35.958
Enough!

24:38.762 --> 24:42.064
- Hannah, wh-what are...
- This is not the way!

25:01.218 --> 25:03.485
This is not the way.

25:26.176 --> 25:27.843
What was that?

25:27.845 --> 25:31.647
Would Dr. Railly approve?

25:31.649 --> 25:33.849
Hannah's right.

25:33.851 --> 25:35.717
This isn't the way.

25:38.889 --> 25:41.390
What's the deepest, darkest
room we got in this place?

25:41.392 --> 25:42.691
One we haven't looked in in months?

25:42.693 --> 25:44.359
There's an empty munitions bunker

25:44.361 --> 25:46.061
down in the sub-basement.

25:46.063 --> 25:47.362
When you undid the storms,

25:47.364 --> 25:48.697
it's where the anomalies spit me out.

25:48.699 --> 25:51.199
It's dark, half-flooded, lots of rats.

25:51.201 --> 25:53.168
It's a dungeon down there.

25:53.170 --> 25:55.555
- Why?
- Perfect.

25:55.558 --> 25:56.723
This is war.

25:56.726 --> 25:58.373
It's one thing to be a warrior,

25:58.375 --> 25:59.841
another to be a barbarian.

25:59.843 --> 26:02.611
Have you heard the
expression, "The greater good"?

26:02.613 --> 26:05.380
- This is not the greater good.
- Uh, guys...

26:05.382 --> 26:07.330
The good that comes
at the cost of our own?

26:07.333 --> 26:09.851
- That's not what this was.
- Guys...

26:09.853 --> 26:12.254
This was revenge...

26:12.256 --> 26:14.542
for losing me.

26:14.545 --> 26:15.878
Oh, whoa!

26:15.881 --> 26:18.915
Otter Eyes just shot
that Monkey into space!

26:18.918 --> 26:20.896
Wahoo!

26:20.898 --> 26:22.564
Yeah!

26:22.566 --> 26:24.900
Scheisse...

26:24.902 --> 26:27.102
Where is she?

26:27.104 --> 26:28.870
Where's Mr. Cole?

26:35.379 --> 26:37.879
What the hell have you done?

26:37.881 --> 26:40.415
Follow me.

26:40.417 --> 26:42.117
Where?

26:42.119 --> 26:43.685
When did you send her?

26:43.687 --> 26:46.688
Ramse and I tortured men
for food, information,

26:46.690 --> 26:47.990
but never for fun.

26:47.992 --> 26:50.092
That woman was engineered
to destroy the world,

26:50.094 --> 26:51.360
and she almost did it.

26:51.362 --> 26:53.495
You're doing it wrong.

26:53.497 --> 26:55.182
People break when they're afraid.

26:55.185 --> 26:58.033
She's not afraid of
pain. She's built for it.

26:58.035 --> 26:59.635
So what is she afraid of?

26:59.637 --> 27:01.837
Being kept in a box.

27:01.839 --> 27:03.705
I went back, brought her
here three months ago.

27:03.707 --> 27:07.109
We don't have time to
break her, so I made some.

27:26.497 --> 27:29.731
We're done playing games.

27:29.733 --> 27:31.199
You ready to talk?

27:34.104 --> 27:36.138
Yeah.

27:43.740 --> 27:46.174
Oh, Jesus.

27:46.176 --> 27:48.943
You come here to interrogate me too?

27:48.945 --> 27:51.679
No.

27:56.419 --> 27:58.319
I went on an egg hunt.

28:05.595 --> 28:09.063
I'm sorry about Sam.

28:09.065 --> 28:14.268
I think, probably, nobody's
said that to you and meant it.

28:18.408 --> 28:21.709
What's it say about this place

28:21.711 --> 28:25.479
that in order to be human,

28:25.481 --> 28:28.382
you gotta be a little crazy?

28:35.792 --> 28:38.292
Out there, in the wilderness,

28:38.294 --> 28:41.262
there were nighttime stories.

28:41.264 --> 28:44.799
The terrible Dr. Grimm,

28:44.801 --> 28:47.468
she lived in the smoke-stack building,

28:47.470 --> 28:51.339
stealing people from the
road to feed to her machine.

28:51.341 --> 28:55.042
Vagabonds and awful children.

28:55.044 --> 29:00.514
These stories were meant
to scare us into being good,

29:00.516 --> 29:03.284
only they frightened me from being bad.

29:07.023 --> 29:09.991
I've killed more men
than rabbits and deer,

29:09.993 --> 29:12.293
but the story stayed with me.

29:14.330 --> 29:18.432
So I've sat with the
creatures I've hunted,

29:18.434 --> 29:21.669
held the hands of dying men,

29:21.671 --> 29:24.572
to be merciful,

29:24.574 --> 29:26.240
never cruel...

29:28.645 --> 29:32.079
Because if not,

29:32.081 --> 29:36.617
I'm just that doctor in
her smoke-stack building.

29:36.619 --> 29:38.719
Stories are true...

29:40.790 --> 29:43.491
But I know that's not who you are.

30:27.003 --> 30:30.938
♪ Don't you forget about me ♪

30:30.940 --> 30:34.608
♪ I'll be alone dancing ♪

30:34.610 --> 30:36.210
♪ You know it, baby ♪

30:36.212 --> 30:40.414
Jesus Christ, what is it
with you and that song?

30:43.486 --> 30:46.687
You ain't gonna MacGyver
your way out of this one.

30:46.689 --> 30:48.556
You do all the pullups you want.

30:48.558 --> 30:50.057
You are his pet.

30:50.059 --> 30:51.659
Well, he's keeping me for something.

30:53.663 --> 30:55.596
One day, that door is gonna open.

30:55.598 --> 30:57.765
He's feeding you hope.

30:57.767 --> 30:59.900
Three squares and a cot.

30:59.902 --> 31:01.702
Wasn't that your sales pitch?

31:01.704 --> 31:04.805
Give a little, take a lot,

31:04.807 --> 31:06.440
make 'em thank you for it.

31:06.442 --> 31:09.310
Same shit I pulled with
your ma and your brother.

31:17.920 --> 31:21.889
I thought we had a chance, me and him,

31:21.891 --> 31:23.691
after you died.

31:23.693 --> 31:25.993
Then the whole world went to shit.

31:27.897 --> 31:30.264
But every awful thing that I did,

31:30.266 --> 31:33.834
I did for him, to protect him,

31:33.836 --> 31:36.437
to spare him from all this shit.

31:36.439 --> 31:38.305
I killed so that he wouldn't have to.

31:38.307 --> 31:41.008
I stole so that he... He could eat.

31:41.010 --> 31:42.843
I took that bullet.

31:46.582 --> 31:50.017
I did way worse shit than you.

31:50.019 --> 31:53.220
You kept him weak. You got him killed.

31:53.222 --> 31:55.356
Oh, you can hate me all you want,

31:55.358 --> 31:58.092
but the only reason that you're alive

31:58.094 --> 32:00.961
is because of what I taught you.

32:14.210 --> 32:15.509
Hey...

32:17.447 --> 32:20.548
'Bout time you start telling
me what I'm doing here.

32:20.550 --> 32:22.083
I told you.

32:22.085 --> 32:24.885
We honor time with patience.

32:30.159 --> 32:32.827
Patience ain't gonna
cut it anymore, friend.

32:39.536 --> 32:42.787
Right, right, left, up, over,

32:42.812 --> 32:46.231
right, left, repeat.

32:46.233 --> 32:51.236
Right, right, left,
up, over, right, left.

32:55.242 --> 33:00.345
Right, left, up, over,

33:00.347 --> 33:02.647
right, left.

33:02.649 --> 33:04.449
- Repeat.
- Right...

33:04.451 --> 33:07.585
right, left, up, over,

33:07.587 --> 33:09.688
right, left, right.

33:09.690 --> 33:12.657
You have no idea what
you're walking into, do you?

33:12.659 --> 33:14.693
Doesn't matter.

33:14.695 --> 33:18.463
Maybe he lets you out of here. Maybe.

33:18.465 --> 33:20.465
But into what? Who knows.

33:20.467 --> 33:23.101
I'm not dying here.

33:23.103 --> 33:24.736
You may have croaked with a whimper,

33:24.738 --> 33:28.773
but I'm going out with a bang,

33:28.775 --> 33:31.209
somewhere far away from this shit-hole.

33:31.211 --> 33:34.212
The Devil always tells you
what you wanna hear, Teddy.

33:34.214 --> 33:38.416
So who's the Devil
now? You or him or me?

33:38.418 --> 33:40.752
It's you, it's you.

33:40.754 --> 33:43.354
Since we were kids,
it has always been you.

33:43.356 --> 33:44.723
I wasn't, though,

33:44.725 --> 33:46.858
'cause I always told you the truth.

33:48.195 --> 33:50.795
Except that... That you're the lie.

33:50.797 --> 33:53.031
You're not even here now.

33:53.033 --> 33:55.100
I just... I just needed something.

33:55.102 --> 33:58.136
I needed something to hate,
I needed something to beat,

33:58.138 --> 34:01.639
and I got you, and I hate you.

34:01.641 --> 34:03.174
I hate the smell.

34:03.176 --> 34:06.845
You smell like Two Buck
Chuck. I hate your voice.

34:08.281 --> 34:12.617
I hate what you did to me...

34:12.619 --> 34:15.286
and him and her.

34:17.491 --> 34:21.493
I hate that I look like you.

34:24.731 --> 34:26.464
But you don't.

34:35.475 --> 34:39.277
My father gave me scars.

34:41.514 --> 34:45.049
It's the only thing I had to pass on.

34:45.051 --> 34:46.751
That doesn't make you me.

34:56.730 --> 35:02.066
♪ Don't you forget about me ♪

35:02.068 --> 35:04.836

I know little beyond my own cycle.

35:59.159 --> 36:02.193
Only fragments of stories,

36:02.195 --> 36:05.263
legends of things yet to be done.

36:05.265 --> 36:08.066
We encountered these four in Paris.

36:08.068 --> 36:11.569
- What are they?
- Teachers, I believe.

36:11.571 --> 36:17.408
Protectors meant to raise the Witness

36:17.410 --> 36:20.381
in the chaos of history.

36:20.384 --> 36:22.347
Raise him?

36:22.349 --> 36:24.782
You can't win against them.

36:24.784 --> 36:28.119
What you do, they can undo.

36:28.121 --> 36:31.055
Like yourselves, they
fight fire with fire

36:31.057 --> 36:32.900
and time with time.

36:32.916 --> 36:35.150
Right.

36:35.152 --> 36:37.719
And Titan?

36:37.721 --> 36:39.187
From what I understand,

36:39.189 --> 36:41.523
it was built for the Witness's return...

36:41.525 --> 36:43.392
Left.

36:43.394 --> 36:45.994
The time when the Witness will return

36:45.996 --> 36:47.562
for The Army of the 12 Monkeys

36:47.564 --> 36:52.034
and lead them to their
timeless forest of red.

36:52.036 --> 36:56.071
How can we stop his return?

36:56.073 --> 37:00.142
Not in the future, but the past.

37:00.144 --> 37:02.944
A single moment, a place in time

37:02.946 --> 37:05.514
when the Witness will
be the most vulnerable.

37:05.516 --> 37:06.707
One chance...

37:07.712 --> 37:09.317
A single opportunity.

37:11.522 --> 37:13.622
I can tell you when and where.

37:17.294 --> 37:20.062
I can tell you how to kill the Witness.

37:55.763 --> 37:57.096
Forget about me?

38:00.286 --> 38:01.802
Deacon.

38:01.804 --> 38:05.672
You ready to get the hell out of here?

38:05.674 --> 38:08.008
Oh, ha.

38:12.314 --> 38:16.450
What would you give
to be back out there?

38:16.452 --> 38:18.085
I don't know.

38:18.087 --> 38:20.587
Plenty of times, we weren't
sure we'd make the night.

38:20.589 --> 38:24.091
Well, you live, you got lucky.

38:24.093 --> 38:27.294
You die, well, you know,

38:27.296 --> 38:29.730
you died for nothing.

38:29.732 --> 38:31.567
It was easier.

38:31.570 --> 38:32.836
I don't know anymore

38:32.839 --> 38:35.469
if there's even a way to undo all this.

38:35.471 --> 38:37.938
I'm tired of thinking in circles.

38:40.109 --> 38:41.775
She says there's a chance.

38:41.777 --> 38:43.944
You can't trust her. You know that.

38:43.946 --> 38:45.612
The whole thing could be a lie.

38:45.614 --> 38:47.681
Well, all we got is the lie.

38:53.689 --> 38:57.891
You know we're done here, right?

38:57.893 --> 39:01.862
- I know.
- What do we got to lose?

39:01.864 --> 39:06.618
She says the Witness
is gonna appear in 2007.

39:06.621 --> 39:07.921
Let's go get him.

39:07.924 --> 39:09.771
She also says he's gonna be surrounded

39:09.774 --> 39:12.105
by an army of followers.

39:12.107 --> 39:14.374
If we don't get to him,

39:14.376 --> 39:17.344
we don't make it out of there.

39:17.346 --> 39:19.479
One last run?

39:19.481 --> 39:22.249
Hm?

39:22.251 --> 39:25.285
Yeah, guess so.

39:28.290 --> 39:32.059
Whatever future happens,

39:32.061 --> 39:34.628
I want you to know that

39:34.630 --> 39:38.298
you are my family in all of 'em.

39:45.903 --> 39:48.008
There we go. You get this done.

39:48.010 --> 39:49.743
I swear to God, if you miss,

39:49.745 --> 39:53.847
I'm gonna live my days
upstate, middle of nowhere.

39:53.849 --> 39:57.984
I'm gonna create my own
little post-apocalypse.

39:57.986 --> 40:00.520
Listen, about Sam...

40:00.522 --> 40:03.390
I know I've stopped you
from pulling a few triggers.

40:03.392 --> 40:06.960
If we find the Witness,
if he's there, he's yours.

40:06.962 --> 40:08.495
Put him down.

40:14.470 --> 40:16.680
Liar!

40:16.683 --> 40:17.815
Liar!

40:17.818 --> 40:20.507
Then kill me if you think it's a lie,

40:20.509 --> 40:21.664
but you know deep down

40:21.667 --> 40:24.311
it's the only thing that
has ever made any sense.

40:27.707 --> 40:29.240
I'm ready.

40:30.743 --> 40:33.444
You shouldn't be. You shouldn't go.

40:33.446 --> 40:34.845
I don't have a choice.

40:34.847 --> 40:36.514
What's gotten into you? What's going on?

40:36.516 --> 40:38.682
Bad feelings, bad thoughts.

40:38.684 --> 40:41.519
- What, like primary visions?
- No.

40:41.521 --> 40:43.387
No, I don't need a third eye

40:43.389 --> 40:46.357
to be able to see that
all of this is wrong.

40:46.359 --> 40:48.959
Mr. Cole, the window is closing.

40:48.961 --> 40:53.030
I'm splintering you to
the Emerson Hotel, 2007.

40:53.032 --> 40:55.132
You'll devise a plan,

40:55.134 --> 40:58.235
you'll execute it.

40:58.237 --> 41:00.471
Kill the Witness, gentlemen.

41:00.473 --> 41:02.072
Tell 'em you're sick or something.

41:02.074 --> 41:03.507
Good luck, Mr. Cole.

41:03.509 --> 41:07.077
- If I see you again...
- It'll be too soon.

41:13.953 --> 41:16.720
Initiate splinter sequence.

41:25.798 --> 41:29.700
James and Cassandra are
the origin of the Witness.

41:31.604 --> 41:33.704
There's only one path forward.

41:44.016 --> 41:46.317
For this to work,

41:46.319 --> 41:48.619
you gotta hurt.

41:48.621 --> 41:51.055
You gotta take a beating.

41:51.057 --> 41:52.923
I'll manage.

41:52.925 --> 41:54.692
Match the coordinates.

41:54.694 --> 41:56.160
Follow sequence.

42:02.101 --> 42:04.969
Can you do it?

42:04.971 --> 42:07.438
Can you kill Cassandra Railly?

42:19.952 --> 42:21.085
Yeah.
