Dawn is fixing you.

00:05.992 --> 00:07.604
Did they catch the guy who stabbed her?

00:07.684 --> 00:08.861
Yeah. Joel's sleepwalker.

00:08.895 --> 00:11.463
You said you would watch me.

[grunts]

00:15.935 --> 00:18.203
The man who stabbed Dr. Reid is dead.

00:18.237 --> 00:19.404
But she is alive.

00:19.439 --> 00:20.805
I'm in a coma, Charlie.

00:20.839 --> 00:22.207

Alex, you got the best
cardiac surgeon in the country.

00:40.059 --> 00:42.093
Yeah, your ex-wife who tried to kill you.

00:42.127 --> 00:43.082
That's not the point.

00:43.225 --> 00:45.059
I'm just saying you got
a great team in your corner.

00:45.109 --> 00:46.530

00:46.565 --> 00:47.665
You're going to.

00:47.732 --> 00:49.667

Oh, finish the hand, Charlie.

01:36.270 --> 01:38.597
Shahir, does Alex have a brain injury?

01:39.054 --> 01:40.197
Well, her MRI is clear,

01:40.262 --> 01:43.062
and E.E.G. shows no sign
of seizure activity.

01:43.887 --> 01:45.921
- Okay, that's great news.
- Yes.

01:46.359 --> 01:49.524
There is absolutely nothing
wrong with Alex's brain...

02:18.249 --> 02:19.526
Believe me. But...

02:20.641 --> 02:23.741
you need to be patient
and try to stay strong.

02:24.145 --> 02:25.718
I don't feel strong.

02:27.211 --> 02:30.376
You sat by my bed for months,
and you never stopped believing.

02:30.449 --> 02:31.907
Well, I don't have that same feeling.

02:31.957 --> 02:32.957
I do.

02:33.715 --> 02:35.169
You're gonna wake up.

- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

02:57.591 --> 02:58.562
It's just,

- since Alex...
- I didn't realize you were keeping tabs.

What's the matter, Zach?

03:33.091 --> 03:34.827
Would you relax? I'm not a serial killer.

03:34.861 --> 03:36.328
The first rule of being a serial killer

03:36.363 --> 03:37.763
is saying, "I'm not a serial killer."

03:37.797 --> 03:38.764
Dr. Lin.

03:38.798 --> 03:39.998
How is she?

Uh, she's good.

03:41.368 --> 03:41.884
She's, um...

03:41.961 --> 03:44.130
she's graduated to
the lowest setting on the vent.

- Yeah. I know. It sucks.

No, I-I'm not using
the ghosty thing to spy on Dawn.

04:21.906 --> 04:23.073
Come on. She'd totally do it to you.

04:25.728 --> 04:27.163
you go in and have a quick snoop around,

04:27.213 --> 04:28.601

with an impassioned pitch

04:28.671 --> 04:30.180

- Fort Wayne, Indiana.

08:04.148 --> 08:08.918
And I get your hand-me-downs... aquafit hip.

08:08.952 --> 08:10.220
You gonna save the leg?

08:10.287 --> 08:11.321
I don't know.

08:11.355 --> 08:12.855
[water running]

08:12.923 --> 08:14.690
Haven't exactly been knocking
them out of the park lately.

08:14.725 --> 08:16.459
[chuckles] Wow.

08:16.527 --> 08:19.229
Am I wrong?

08:19.263 --> 08:20.830
Joel.

08:22.733 --> 08:24.867
[clears throat] We're extubating Alex.

08:27.237 --> 08:28.370
Wait, if you do that,

08:28.438 --> 08:30.006
you understand
that she could bleed or swell.

08:30.040 --> 08:32.274
We all know the risks.

08:34.210 --> 08:35.745
Okay, I guess I should see her, then.

08:37.014 --> 08:38.780
You asking my permission?

08:38.849 --> 08:40.916
[sighs] I suppose I am, yeah.

08:41.918 --> 08:44.153
It's not my permission you need.
It's your own.

08:52.929 --> 08:54.029
[chuckles]

08:58.167 --> 09:00.501
[sighs]

09:03.606 --> 09:06.741
I miss being a doctor.

09:06.809 --> 09:08.109
You're still a doctor, Alex.

09:08.143 --> 09:10.244
No, I'm not.

09:10.312 --> 09:12.714
You're the ghost doctor.

09:12.782 --> 09:14.282
I'm just a ghost.

09:17.519 --> 09:19.387
[monitor beeps]

09:19.421 --> 09:21.622
Looks like the braised lamb with
kokkinisto I made last night.

09:21.690 --> 09:23.091
Excuse me?

09:23.158 --> 09:24.392
What? Everything reminds me of food.

09:24.426 --> 09:26.127
It's all good. I'm from Roxbury.

09:26.161 --> 09:27.995
Everything reminds me of road kill.

09:28.029 --> 09:30.297
You know, there's
an abscess over this
old surgical site here.

09:30.364 --> 09:32.566
I'm gonna open the old incision
on the medial side of the tibia.

09:32.601 --> 09:36.070
Thank you.

09:36.137 --> 09:38.973
[monitor beeps]

09:39.040 --> 09:40.540
Ugh. Sheesh.

09:40.575 --> 09:42.009
That reeks.

09:42.077 --> 09:43.010
And that's a lot of pus.

09:43.078 --> 09:46.146
Okay. Sucker?

09:46.417 --> 09:49.029
Okay, we're already
so plugged up with this one.

09:49.137 --> 09:50.350
Give me... give a yankauer.

09:50.384 --> 09:52.452
- You usually use the frazier...
- Yankauer tip, please.

09:52.487 --> 09:53.853
Switching up the luck, huh?

09:53.887 --> 09:55.188
Whenever I'm hitting an "0-fer,"

09:55.223 --> 09:56.656
I, uh, reach for a different bat too.

09:56.724 --> 09:58.133
So, what am I looking at here, Dr. Larouche?

09:58.206 --> 09:59.137
The infection involves

09:59.222 --> 10:00.927
his posterior superficial compartment, sir.

10:00.961 --> 10:02.496
Yes, it has eroded through
the cortex of the tibia.

10:02.530 --> 10:03.963
The tibia is almost
entirely filled with pus.

10:03.998 --> 10:05.297
Now, how is that even possible?

10:05.365 --> 10:07.366
Dirty needle. Bacteria meets implant.

10:07.400 --> 10:09.235
Metal doesn't have a blood supply.

10:10.237 --> 10:11.871
Rian: - What's that?
- That would be biofilm.

10:12.742 --> 10:15.038
Yeah, I don't think ortho's
gonna be my thing.

10:15.161 --> 10:16.323
This is a locking plate.

10:16.449 --> 10:18.044
Clearly this guy wasn't
always on the streets.

10:18.078 --> 10:19.178
He's sat-ing at 90.

10:19.212 --> 10:20.712
What's the surgical plan, doctor?

10:21.681 --> 10:23.516
Oh, um, uh, remove the hardware

10:23.550 --> 10:25.717
and, uh, debride the necrotic tissue.

10:25.752 --> 10:27.853
That's right, and then we
irrigate, irrigate, irrigate.

10:27.887 --> 10:29.121
Irrigate. Yes, sir.

10:29.189 --> 10:31.089
Whatever you're gonna do,
you better do it quickly.

10:31.124 --> 10:32.558
He's not handling his general well.

10:32.592 --> 10:34.293
I've already got him on a dopamine drip.

10:34.327 --> 10:36.061
Okay, let's do this, kids.

10:36.095 --> 10:38.951
We could be here a little while.

10:39.031 --> 10:41.089
I feel like such a dork.

10:41.305 --> 10:43.212
Your body's changing.
So is your equilibrium.

10:43.262 --> 10:44.574
Falls are extremely common.

10:44.624 --> 10:46.428
Still, if I can't put up
a bunny mobile sober,

10:46.513 --> 10:47.905
what kind of shot does this kid have?

10:47.940 --> 10:49.007
Hmm.

10:49.041 --> 10:50.141
[sighs]

10:50.209 --> 10:53.043
- Is he gonna be okay?
- Just having a feel.

10:53.078 --> 10:54.545
Are you experiencing any other symptoms?

10:54.580 --> 10:56.714
You mean besides
the crippling embarrassment?

10:56.748 --> 10:57.815
Mnh. Bit of a headache.

10:57.850 --> 10:59.183
Tell me if that gets any worse.

10:59.217 --> 11:00.485
I'm fine. [sighs]

11:00.519 --> 11:02.453
Really, I'm-I'm just worried
about the baby.

11:02.521 --> 11:03.888
Everything feels fine.

11:03.922 --> 11:06.390
Dr. Lin, would you mind finding
baby's heartbeat, please?

11:06.424 --> 11:07.525
David: Here you are.

11:07.559 --> 11:09.393
I-I didn't get the message until now.

11:09.427 --> 11:10.827
This might feel a bit cold, Lara.

11:10.862 --> 11:11.795
My husband.

11:11.863 --> 11:12.863
Sorry. Stupid phone was off.

11:12.897 --> 11:13.864
Stupid story meeting.

11:13.931 --> 11:15.466
David's a writer on a kids' show.

11:15.500 --> 11:17.534
Which is ironic
because I don't like children.

11:17.568 --> 11:19.507
Oh, you don't hate kids.
You just hate people.

11:19.572 --> 11:21.138
- Mnh.
- Could you keep still for me, Lara?

11:21.206 --> 11:22.306
Is there a problem?

11:22.340 --> 11:24.008
- No. I'm just trying to...
- What happened?

11:24.075 --> 11:25.609
Uh, the-the bunny mobile happened.

11:25.643 --> 11:26.530
Dr. Lin?

11:26.668 --> 11:28.077
I'm having a little trouble...

11:28.112 --> 11:29.579
- finding the heartbeat.
- Okay.

11:29.647 --> 11:30.714
- What?
- What?

11:30.748 --> 11:31.738
Oh, my god.

11:33.050 --> 11:34.384
There it is.

11:34.451 --> 11:35.418
[sighing] Oh, god.

11:35.452 --> 11:36.920
Sha. Sha. I need to listen.

11:36.954 --> 11:39.422
[ultrasound whooshing, beeping]

11:39.490 --> 11:41.057
Okay, it's a bit accelerated.

11:41.125 --> 11:42.791
- Is that bad?
- No, it's probably nothing.

11:42.859 --> 11:44.560
But I'm gonna send you down
for a formal ultrasound

11:44.594 --> 11:45.561
just to make sure.

11:45.595 --> 11:46.829
Okay. [sighs]

11:46.897 --> 11:48.054
Dr. Lin here will escort you
down to imaging,

11:48.154 --> 11:49.965
provided that she can find it.

11:50.034 --> 11:52.535
Of course.

11:54.304 --> 11:56.439
Joel: Look at that. The infection's
unbelievably widespread.

11:56.507 --> 11:57.840
Rian: Ah.

11:57.908 --> 11:59.508
Okay, we're gonna have to access
the intramedullary canal.

11:59.576 --> 12:00.809
How do we do that, Dr. Larouche?

12:01.878 --> 12:03.478
A lot of hard work, sir.

12:03.547 --> 12:05.147
A lot of hard work.

12:05.197 --> 12:06.348
"Through the cortical erosion"

12:06.382 --> 12:07.382
would have been the correct answer, but...

12:07.417 --> 12:08.551
[metal tapping]

12:08.585 --> 12:10.318
I'll take anything from you right now.

12:11.988 --> 12:13.656
- What did you just do?
- I just removed the plate. Why?

12:13.723 --> 12:15.223
His sats just dropped to 80%.

12:15.291 --> 12:16.724
- No, they did not.
- It's pulmonary embolus.

12:16.792 --> 12:18.326
Yeah, he's definitely high risk for DVT.

12:18.394 --> 12:19.528
I mean, he's a homeless addict.

12:19.595 --> 12:20.795
He's been on the table a while, sir.

12:20.863 --> 12:21.963
I can't keep him ventilated.

12:21.997 --> 12:23.265
[monitor beeping]

12:23.332 --> 12:25.067
What... what are we gonna do?

12:25.101 --> 12:28.970
[beeping intensifies]

12:29.038 --> 12:31.339
Dr. Goran?

12:33.008 --> 12:34.776
We have to separate the problem
from the patient.

12:34.843 --> 12:36.444
We have to amputate.
Give me the bone saw right now.

12:36.511 --> 12:38.379
Damn it.

12:38.447 --> 12:40.715
P.E. that's... that's bad damn luck.

12:40.783 --> 12:43.117
That's bad damn luck.

12:45.654 --> 12:47.021
You know what? Scratch that.

12:47.089 --> 12:48.722
Get me 4 units of O-negative blood.

12:48.790 --> 12:50.157
Give him 5,000 I.V. heparin.

12:50.225 --> 12:51.792
I've changed my mind.
We're not gonna amputate.

12:51.859 --> 12:52.960
We're gonna save the leg
and get him off the table.

12:53.027 --> 12:55.062
Give me the scalpel right now.

12:55.097 --> 12:57.164
[sniffs] Ah, that's the pee smell.

12:57.199 --> 12:59.100
- You get used to it.
- Oh, I won't.

12:59.623 --> 13:01.302
David's got a thing
about other people's fluids.

13:01.336 --> 13:03.137
My boyfriend's afraid of thick drinks.

13:03.171 --> 13:05.105
- Yeah, I get that.
- Of course you do.

13:05.139 --> 13:07.407
David once had a panic attack at the Spa...

13:07.475 --> 13:08.775
during a coconut mud wrap.

13:08.810 --> 13:10.243
But I didn't have use of my arms.

13:10.277 --> 13:11.258
[chuckles]

13:11.331 --> 13:13.246
My wife... uh, she likes to
make jokes at my expense

13:13.280 --> 13:14.514
to cover her nerves.

13:14.548 --> 13:15.882
Yeah, well, David usually goes for

13:15.917 --> 13:17.250
a roast beef sandwich to cover his.

13:17.318 --> 13:18.418
[chuckles] What can I say?

13:18.486 --> 13:20.053
I'm emotionally eating for three.

13:20.088 --> 13:21.488
[chuckles] I get that.

13:23.357 --> 13:24.491
You okay?

13:24.525 --> 13:25.758
Mm. Headache's a bit worse.

13:25.792 --> 13:27.594
Do you think you could
get me something for it?

13:27.628 --> 13:29.028
Yeah, I'll put an order in, okay?

13:29.062 --> 13:30.796
Actually, I probably got something in here.

13:30.831 --> 13:32.298
Oh, check the man purse.

13:32.333 --> 13:34.267
Your boyfriend
take this kind of abuse, doctor?

13:34.335 --> 13:35.901
He's my ex, actually.

13:35.936 --> 13:38.738
I don't know why I said that before.

13:38.772 --> 13:40.039
Got...

13:40.073 --> 13:41.040
[sighs]

13:41.074 --> 13:42.108
Lara?

13:42.142 --> 13:43.109
- Lara?
- Lara?

13:43.143 --> 13:45.011
- Hey.
- Lara? Can you hear me?

13:45.045 --> 13:46.979
Hey.

13:47.014 --> 13:48.313
Can't find a pulse.

13:48.348 --> 13:50.149
- Baby?
- Okay, we're gonna get her on the ground, okay?

13:50.183 --> 13:51.283
- Quickly.
- Okay.

13:51.317 --> 13:53.819
[alarm ringing, elevator bell dings]

13:53.854 --> 13:55.354
Woman: <i>Code blue...</i>

13:55.388 --> 13:56.955
I've got a pulse, but it's thready.

13:56.989 --> 13:58.990
I need you to page Dr. Katz
in O.B. right away.

13:59.025 --> 14:00.125
Good job, Maggie.

14:00.160 --> 14:03.262
Please! Hurry!

14:03.296 --> 14:05.597
Lara. Lara, come on.

14:05.632 --> 14:07.566
Try to stay calm, Mr. Zarb.

14:07.600 --> 14:08.567
My baby.

14:08.601 --> 14:10.068
What's happening?

14:10.102 --> 14:12.637
- Why isn't she breathing?
- Can you see me?

14:12.672 --> 14:14.039
[exhales sharply]

14:14.073 --> 14:15.974
You can't. You can't see me.

14:16.042 --> 14:17.441
- Um...
Maggie: - Get the crash cart!

14:17.509 --> 14:19.577
And call the code team! [gasping]

14:19.611 --> 14:20.679
It's... it's okay.

14:20.713 --> 14:22.213
David: Is she gonna be okay?

14:22.247 --> 14:23.748
You're not alone.

14:23.783 --> 14:25.717
I'm right here with you.

14:25.751 --> 14:28.352
Hurry!

14:33.881 --> 14:36.949
[telephone ringing]

14:39.052 --> 14:40.119
How is she?

14:40.153 --> 14:41.787
We weren't able to secure the aneurysm.

14:41.855 --> 14:42.922
Okay. What does that mean?

14:42.956 --> 14:44.523
There was a bleed in your wife's brain.

14:44.591 --> 14:45.758
She's in a coma.

14:45.825 --> 14:48.360
What? How did this happen? Was it the fall?

14:48.428 --> 14:50.462
No, my guess is that the fall was caused

14:50.497 --> 14:52.398
by a sentinel bleed
from a pre-existing aneurysm.

14:52.498 --> 14:55.100
See, I-I don't... she was with
the doctors this whole time.

14:55.167 --> 14:58.570
The initial bleed was small.
She was asymptomatic.

14:58.605 --> 15:01.273
The aneurysm must have erupted
in the elevator.

15:01.340 --> 15:02.340
Okay, I want to see her.

15:02.409 --> 15:03.509
Of course.

15:03.543 --> 15:04.709
Is there anyone else you'd like to call?

15:04.777 --> 15:06.011
Lara's parents?

15:06.045 --> 15:09.480
Uh, no. They're both dead.

15:09.548 --> 15:10.615
There's my mom. She's in Florida.

15:10.682 --> 15:11.616
I-I'll call her.

15:11.683 --> 15:13.118
Okay.

15:16.589 --> 15:20.458
[breathing deeply]

15:22.528 --> 15:25.196
[telephone ringing, monitor beeping]

15:25.264 --> 15:26.898
What?

15:26.966 --> 15:28.733
No, man, that's not... that's not right.

15:29.307 --> 15:30.796
That's not right, no.

15:30.904 --> 15:34.408
Come on. What are you talking about?

15:34.762 --> 15:36.207
Oh, I-I got to go, man. No. [stammers]

15:36.275 --> 15:37.875
Give me the ph...

15:37.910 --> 15:40.377
He...

15:40.939 --> 15:41.758
Who are you talking to?

15:41.808 --> 15:42.914
Chicken.

15:43.077 --> 15:44.916
He says if he wasn't with me,
he never would have been busted.

15:44.983 --> 15:46.150
I take it chicken's your dealer?

15:46.217 --> 15:47.251
Yeah, he says I'm bad luck.

15:47.319 --> 15:50.020
I don't know about that, Roy.

15:50.539 --> 15:52.339
We just saved your leg.

15:52.451 --> 15:53.832
It's chicken who's...

15:54.120 --> 15:55.470
he lost his father's fish store.

15:55.520 --> 15:57.893
Only been in the family 40 years.

15:58.236 --> 16:00.397
He lost his car.
He lost his friggin' teeth, man.

16:00.432 --> 16:01.731
Well, you're lucky to be alive, mate.

16:01.799 --> 16:03.474
Yeah, well, when it's my time to go...

16:03.524 --> 16:04.335
It's not.

16:05.002 --> 16:05.713
How do you know?

16:05.763 --> 16:07.271
'Cause I just made a deal with myself...

16:07.436 --> 16:08.990
no one is dying today.

16:09.040 --> 16:10.275
Oh, so, this is all about you.

16:10.325 --> 16:11.329
Pretty much.

16:11.894 --> 16:12.909
All you need to know is,

16:12.944 --> 16:14.945
your life just became the most
important thing in mine.

16:14.979 --> 16:16.079
Right on.

16:16.113 --> 16:17.213
Our only chance to attack this infection

16:17.281 --> 16:18.775
is by flooding your body with antibiotics.

16:18.825 --> 16:20.364
- Fill your boots, man.
- In order to do that,

16:20.418 --> 16:22.164
I need to insert what's called a PICC line.

16:22.214 --> 16:23.756
It's essentially a central catheter

16:23.806 --> 16:25.949
that allows me direct access
to your bloodstream.

16:25.999 --> 16:28.257
However, if I do this

16:28.922 --> 16:31.127
and you inject your body with drugs,

16:31.745 --> 16:33.530
you'll probably overdose
and you'll probably die.

16:34.245 --> 16:35.749
Well, don't beat around the bush, doc.

16:35.799 --> 16:37.165
Tell me how you really feel.

16:37.200 --> 16:39.201
I'm not telling you how I feel.
I'm telling you the facts.

16:39.235 --> 16:40.869
Now, promise me that you won't do that.

16:42.772 --> 16:43.865
Look, I don't want to die.

16:43.953 --> 16:46.208
Do I hear a promise?

16:48.544 --> 16:49.844
Yeah.

16:49.878 --> 16:51.546
Beautiful.

16:51.581 --> 16:54.549
I will send you down
to radiology, get the PICC.

16:55.285 --> 16:57.119
Hey, what are you doing?

16:57.153 --> 16:58.420
I'm taking this chicken to go.

16:58.454 --> 17:00.688
No, you don't have to... [sighs]

17:00.723 --> 17:02.466
Hey, anyone visits him,

17:02.516 --> 17:04.058
you contact me immediately, okay?

17:04.093 --> 17:05.059
You got it.

17:05.094 --> 17:07.662
[groans, sighs]

17:07.695 --> 17:09.497
[heart monitor beeping]

17:09.597 --> 17:12.124
Normal dopplers through
the umbilical cord are present.

17:12.190 --> 17:13.819
Have you ever seen a case like this?

17:13.913 --> 17:15.967
No, thank god.

17:16.074 --> 17:18.751
Middle cerebral-artery dopplers also normal.

17:19.174 --> 17:20.273
I've read case studies,

17:20.308 --> 17:21.808
but a patient like this is very rare.

17:21.843 --> 17:22.876
It's bad luck.

17:22.910 --> 17:24.411
Scanning the placenta.

17:24.445 --> 17:26.847
No obvious signs of abruption.

17:26.881 --> 17:28.582
I don't believe in luck.

17:28.617 --> 17:30.217
- What do you believe in?
- God

17:30.567 --> 17:32.321
and medicine, in that order.

17:32.444 --> 17:33.579
Amniotic fluid?

17:33.691 --> 17:35.945
Volume's within normal range.

17:36.557 --> 17:38.014
So, why obstetrics?

17:38.795 --> 17:39.856
Oh, I don't know.

17:39.937 --> 17:41.899
Cervical length is nice and long.

17:41.964 --> 17:43.163
Every case is different.

17:43.197 --> 17:44.631
It's kind of like jazz.

17:44.666 --> 17:47.768
The real magic happens
when you start to improvise.

17:47.802 --> 17:50.545
Everything you think you've learned
from Jason Kalfas, forget it.

17:50.626 --> 17:52.361
My residents don't improvise.

17:53.203 --> 17:54.269
Got it.

17:54.369 --> 17:55.846
What are we looking at?

17:56.176 --> 17:58.578
Fetal measurements
of the biparietal diameter,

17:58.646 --> 18:00.384
head circumference, abdominal circumference,

18:00.469 --> 18:03.716
femur length are all consistent
with 20-weeks gestation.

18:03.784 --> 18:06.518
Good. Let's go tell dad.

18:08.188 --> 18:09.922
We'll send mom for a formal anatomy scan

18:09.990 --> 18:10.956
when she's more stable.

18:11.024 --> 18:12.324
What if she doesn't recover?

18:12.392 --> 18:13.926
We work for and pray that she does.

18:13.994 --> 18:15.094
But if she doesn't?

18:15.162 --> 18:17.262
Jump off that bridge when it comes.

18:17.330 --> 18:18.731
Mr. Zarb.

18:18.799 --> 18:20.800
[sighs] Finally.

18:20.867 --> 18:21.812
I can go back in?

18:21.862 --> 18:22.647
Yes.

18:22.701 --> 18:24.055
I can't believe you kicked me out.

18:24.151 --> 18:26.205
- We didn't kick you out, sir.
- It's hospital policy.

18:26.272 --> 18:27.336
Yeah, well, the policy sucks.

18:27.401 --> 18:29.474
With family members present,
it makes it harder for us.

18:29.555 --> 18:31.142
We just want to do the best job.

18:31.211 --> 18:32.578
What about what <i>I</i> want?

18:32.612 --> 18:33.745
You're upset.

18:33.779 --> 18:35.347
You're damn right I'm upset!

18:35.415 --> 18:38.149
I just want to be with my wife.

18:38.218 --> 18:41.820
Mr. Zarb, your baby... he's doing well.

18:41.887 --> 18:43.321
Oh, well, good for him.

18:43.355 --> 18:44.856
Okay, you're mad at him.

18:44.924 --> 18:46.657
I understand that,

18:46.726 --> 18:50.195
and you should let yourself feel it.

18:50.262 --> 18:53.497
Rail at-at us, god, the baby,
whoever you need to,

18:53.565 --> 18:54.866
but it needs to come out.

18:54.900 --> 18:55.866
Unh!

18:55.900 --> 18:57.101
Ohh!

18:57.168 --> 18:58.703
I think I broke my hand.

18:58.737 --> 19:00.605
[breathing heavily, groans]

19:00.639 --> 19:03.274
This is why I didn't go into psychiatry.

19:05.410 --> 19:06.477
Let me have a look.

19:08.913 --> 19:11.048
Okay, she's a ghost. I'm a ghost.

19:11.116 --> 19:13.083
So, how come she can't see me?

19:13.118 --> 19:16.019
I-I don't know.
It... it could be a good thing.

19:16.054 --> 19:17.654
[scoffs]

19:17.688 --> 19:18.856
Or a really bad thing.

19:18.890 --> 19:20.023
[sighs]

19:20.058 --> 19:22.192
Look, it's-it's like she can feel me,

19:22.227 --> 19:24.762
like somehow my presence
comforts her, but...

19:24.796 --> 19:26.764
You have to talk to her, Charlie.

19:27.015 --> 19:29.299
I'm kind of all about the ghost
in front of me right now.

19:30.104 --> 19:32.302
She's scared and all alone.

19:32.336 --> 19:34.271
"Physician, heal thy girlfriend?"

19:34.766 --> 19:37.741
I'm fine. I-I will be fine.

19:37.775 --> 19:39.242
Just promise me you'll talk to her.

19:39.277 --> 19:41.455
Okay, I promise I'll-I'll talk to her.

19:41.505 --> 19:42.989
- [cellphone vibrating]
- Okay.

19:43.382 --> 19:45.481
Right after I fix her husband's hand.

19:47.751 --> 19:49.518
[sighs]

19:54.124 --> 19:56.259
[telephone ringing]

19:56.293 --> 19:58.305
[indistinct conversations]

19:58.432 --> 20:00.562
You're as white as the coffee-mate, mate.

20:00.597 --> 20:02.331
Rough day?

20:02.365 --> 20:04.800
Rough week.

20:05.283 --> 20:07.235
They're taking Alex off the vent today.

20:07.270 --> 20:09.070
I know. I heard.

20:09.105 --> 20:11.006
You gonna be there for it?

20:12.845 --> 20:15.977
[cellphone ringing]

20:16.012 --> 20:17.846
Nurses' station.

20:17.880 --> 20:19.080
Hello? Yeah?

20:19.148 --> 20:21.516
Sexy nurse Heidi
stuck in her scrub top again?

20:21.550 --> 20:23.651
No, you keep an eye on him.
I'll be right there.

20:23.686 --> 20:25.086
Yes.

20:25.121 --> 20:27.956
Drug addict with an embolism.

20:27.990 --> 20:30.125
I think his dealer just showed up.

20:30.159 --> 20:31.293
[elevator bell dings]

20:31.327 --> 20:32.493
Sorry.

20:37.132 --> 20:40.000
Hey. Hey!

20:41.704 --> 20:43.338
Wait!

20:43.405 --> 20:45.272
- Stop him!
Woman: - Security!

20:45.307 --> 20:47.809
Hey... wait!

20:47.843 --> 20:49.076
Hey! No, grab him!

20:53.014 --> 20:54.581
I don't care about my stupid hand.

20:54.615 --> 20:57.318
- Can you make a fist for me, please?
- [groans, inhales sharply]

20:57.385 --> 20:59.019
I don't want to be away from her.

20:59.430 --> 21:01.042
I'm gonna get you out of here
as soon as I can.

21:01.022 --> 21:02.356
Every time I leave her alone in this place,

21:02.390 --> 21:03.458
something bad happ... [gasps]

21:03.525 --> 21:05.893
Mr. Zarb, your wife's in good hands.

21:05.928 --> 21:07.294
That's a joke, right?

21:07.362 --> 21:09.347
I mean, she was healthy when
she arrived here this morning.

21:09.469 --> 21:11.231
I know it's hard to wrap
your head around right now.

21:11.515 --> 21:13.849
Um... this...

21:14.349 --> 21:16.200
here, what you have is a boxer's fracture.

21:16.250 --> 21:18.137
Um, the knuckle
on your little finger's broken.

21:18.205 --> 21:20.273
I'm gonna tape it. It might hurt a bit.

21:22.476 --> 21:24.952
It was the most normal morning in the world.

21:26.506 --> 21:29.944
I got up. I gave her a kiss. I went to work.

21:30.684 --> 21:31.751
This is a...

21:31.818 --> 21:32.852
A nightmare?

21:32.920 --> 21:34.754
Yeah, you got no idea.

21:38.949 --> 21:40.712
I blame him.

21:42.128 --> 21:43.462
I do... the baby.

21:45.290 --> 21:46.784
I know I shouldn't, but I...

21:46.850 --> 21:47.845
[sighs]

21:48.925 --> 21:50.091
I can't.

21:54.207 --> 21:55.340
I hate him for doing this to us.

21:55.409 --> 21:56.442
[P.A. system beeps]

21:56.501 --> 21:59.411
Woman: <i>Code blue, I.C.U., room 4.</i>

21:59.687 --> 22:01.679
- <i>Code blue, I.C.U...</i>
- That's Lara's room.

22:01.714 --> 22:03.348
<i>Room 4.</i>

22:03.383 --> 22:06.718
[monitors beeping]

22:09.389 --> 22:10.889
Shahir: Lara?

22:10.957 --> 22:12.357
Lara, can you hear me?

22:12.425 --> 22:14.626
- What? What's happening?
- Her pupils are fixed.

22:14.660 --> 22:16.694
- What does that mean?
- Can you get him out of here?

22:16.762 --> 22:17.719
- Mr. Zarb...
- No.

22:17.817 --> 22:19.022
- Hey. No!
- Hey. Hey!

22:19.101 --> 22:20.950
Hey! Okay, I am not leaving her alone again!

22:21.333 --> 22:23.034
[exhales sharply]

22:23.068 --> 22:24.296
[groans]

22:24.411 --> 22:28.841
Please... tell me what is happening.

22:29.248 --> 22:30.808
Her E.E.G. shows no activity.

22:30.875 --> 22:31.976
What does that mean?

22:33.212 --> 22:35.946
Your wife... she's...

22:35.980 --> 22:37.797
brain-dead.

22:37.997 --> 22:40.783
I'm sorry. Your wife is brain-dead.

22:48.873 --> 22:51.170
[heart monitor beeping]

22:51.204 --> 22:53.205
Shahir: The machine will
continue to breathe for her,

22:53.240 --> 22:55.274
but in the eyes of the law,
your wife is now dead.

22:55.576 --> 22:56.702
But your son...

22:57.093 --> 22:58.361
he isn't.

22:58.745 --> 23:02.114
His fetal heartbeat is present
and within the normal range.

23:02.149 --> 23:04.116
Shahir: But because your wife is dead...

23:04.151 --> 23:05.918
- Oh, stop saying that.
- I'm sorry.

23:06.117 --> 23:07.973
But there's a decision to be made...

23:08.173 --> 23:10.455
whether to discontinue
mechanical ventilation.

23:11.257 --> 23:12.357
Pull the plug?

23:13.392 --> 23:14.590
That's right.

23:14.688 --> 23:18.708
Knowing that if you do,
the fetus will also die.

23:18.826 --> 23:20.331
Or continue full support

23:20.366 --> 23:21.833
in an attempt to prolong the pregnancy.

23:23.769 --> 23:28.047
You're saying you can keep the baby alive...

23:28.541 --> 23:30.208
inside of my wife, even though she's...

23:30.242 --> 23:33.445
That's right, until the fetus
can be safely delivered.

23:34.536 --> 23:35.746
How long will that be?

23:36.109 --> 23:37.738
In 10 weeks.

23:38.264 --> 23:41.318
We realize this is a lot to digest.

23:41.352 --> 23:43.988
But we do need to know
how you'd like us to proceed.

23:45.624 --> 23:46.857
Mr. Zarb?

23:48.181 --> 23:50.160
What would you like us to do?

23:52.013 --> 23:53.524
I don't know.

23:59.057 --> 24:00.154
Woman: <i>Look. Look.</i>

24:00.204 --> 24:01.360
Roy.

24:02.417 --> 24:03.540
Hey.

24:04.525 --> 24:05.576
So, what are we watching?

24:05.763 --> 24:07.776
Oh, this is a cooking show...

24:07.826 --> 24:09.379
a couple grannies sharing a kitchen.

24:09.414 --> 24:10.614
Woman #2: <i>I don't think so!</i>

24:10.648 --> 24:11.982
[ <i>laughter</i> ] Man: <i>Excuse me?</i>

24:12.049 --> 24:14.283
So, what, you just come here
to watch tube with me or...?

24:14.351 --> 24:16.352
Well, yeah, that,
and it's significantly easier

24:16.386 --> 24:18.622
to chase away a drug dealer
if you're in the same room.

24:19.326 --> 24:21.303
[chuckling] Oh, yeah.

24:21.470 --> 24:22.515
So, you're moving in.

24:22.603 --> 24:24.494
Uh, just till the end of my shift, yeah.

24:24.528 --> 24:25.495
Well, pull up a chair, then.

24:25.562 --> 24:27.296
Nope. No sitting.

24:27.364 --> 24:28.697
No sleeping.

24:28.765 --> 24:30.866
You're just gonna stand there
and watch TV for five hours?

24:30.934 --> 24:33.269
Pretty much, if I have to.

24:33.337 --> 24:34.590
Right on.

24:35.897 --> 24:37.030
<i>Yeah, tell her she's great.</i>

24:37.095 --> 24:38.346
<i>Okay. She's great.</i>

24:38.409 --> 24:39.151
[ <i>laughter</i> ]

24:39.299 --> 24:40.997
<i>No, but say it like you mean it.</i>

24:41.341 --> 24:42.503
[laughs]

24:42.553 --> 24:43.812
<i>Give her a little kiss.</i>

24:43.880 --> 24:44.913
And I thought I was nuts.

24:44.981 --> 24:45.683
[laughs]

24:45.768 --> 24:47.584
Woman: I love her, but I can't...

24:48.536 --> 24:50.481
Hey, why you doing this?

24:51.646 --> 24:53.469
- I already told you.
- Yeah,

24:53.692 --> 24:55.190
yeah, the-the pact with yourself.

24:55.258 --> 24:57.225
I know, but [scoffs] why me?

24:58.145 --> 25:00.495
Mnh. Patron saint of lost causes.

25:00.835 --> 25:03.288
Oh, thanks a lot. [chuckles]

25:04.592 --> 25:06.968
"O most holy apostle, St. Jude,"

25:07.527 --> 25:10.010
"faithful servant and friend of Jesus."

25:11.406 --> 25:13.934
My mom ran the sunday school.

25:14.843 --> 25:16.611
Poor woman.

25:16.679 --> 25:20.440
Tried so hard to get me
to believe in something.

25:21.449 --> 25:22.285
Something wrong with your arm?

25:22.338 --> 25:23.868
Well, it-it hurts under the pit a bit.

25:23.931 --> 25:25.228
Let me take a look at it.

25:25.763 --> 25:27.602
Hey, speaking of saints, you know a...

25:27.704 --> 25:29.023
a doc named Selena?

25:29.306 --> 25:31.192
Works out of a drop-in on Gerrard?

25:31.226 --> 25:32.922
No. No, I don't. Raise up your arm.

25:33.011 --> 25:34.840
All right.

25:36.991 --> 25:38.666
What? What... what is it?

25:38.733 --> 25:39.933
It's another infection site.

25:39.967 --> 25:41.496
[sighing] How did we miss that?

25:41.611 --> 25:43.273
Well, good thing I got my new main line.

25:43.323 --> 25:45.038
No, antibiotics
aren't gonna do a damn thing.

25:45.073 --> 25:46.207
We need to pull that PICC line out

25:46.241 --> 25:47.119
and get you straight back into the O.R.

25:47.171 --> 25:48.775
- Another operation?!
- Listen to me, Roy...

25:48.810 --> 25:50.015
it's risky, but if we don't clean that,

25:50.065 --> 25:52.540
that infection's
gonna eat the surrounding flesh.

25:52.681 --> 25:53.745
It's... [sighs]

25:53.814 --> 25:55.882
What? It'll kill me?

25:57.585 --> 26:00.129
Oh, maybe chicken was right, huh?

26:00.395 --> 26:01.824
Maybe I am bad luck.

26:03.124 --> 26:06.259
[indistinct conversations]

26:09.830 --> 26:11.003
Mr. Zarb.

26:11.676 --> 26:13.333
Hi. I'm Dr. Murphy.

26:14.901 --> 26:16.969
[sighs] You're a shrink.

26:19.482 --> 26:20.838
Been in therapy half my life.

26:20.900 --> 26:22.908
There's a certain whiff. No offense.

26:23.357 --> 26:24.910
None taken.

26:25.655 --> 26:27.079
Do you mind if I join you?

26:29.750 --> 26:31.016
Have a seat.

26:40.160 --> 26:41.860
[telephone rings]

26:41.894 --> 26:43.629
You here to tell me what I should do?

26:44.187 --> 26:45.597
No.

26:45.665 --> 26:49.868
I'm just here to listen... if you want.

26:49.902 --> 26:51.370
So, you're in therapy?

26:53.388 --> 26:54.863
Yeah.

26:56.416 --> 26:57.842
Anxiety.

26:57.910 --> 26:59.210
Crappy dad.

26:59.844 --> 27:01.612
He still in the picture?

27:01.680 --> 27:03.248
He never really was.

27:05.818 --> 27:06.918
You married?

27:08.425 --> 27:09.453
No.

27:12.057 --> 27:14.525
[sighs] I loved it.

27:16.895 --> 27:18.110
[inhales sharply]

27:18.198 --> 27:21.312
I was never really
into the chase, to be honest.

27:22.701 --> 27:24.702
I know what you mean.

27:26.776 --> 27:28.372
You should take all the time that you need

27:28.440 --> 27:29.707
to make this decision.

27:34.779 --> 27:37.414
All the time in the world
isn't gonna bring her back.

27:40.240 --> 27:42.765
Besides, she made all the decisions.

27:43.554 --> 27:45.833
I just made dinner.

27:54.198 --> 27:57.300
[monitor beeps]

27:59.470 --> 28:00.603
How you holding up?

28:00.925 --> 28:03.039
You mean besides being dead and pregnant?

28:03.106 --> 28:04.207
[exhales sharply]

28:04.274 --> 28:05.808
Sorry.

28:05.843 --> 28:08.177
I crack jokes to cover my nerves.

28:08.212 --> 28:09.846
[sighs]

28:09.913 --> 28:11.814
Do you have kids?

28:11.849 --> 28:14.583
Um, no. No, I don't.

28:14.651 --> 28:16.252
Do you want them?

28:20.990 --> 28:22.157
Yes, I do.

28:24.026 --> 28:25.661
I know my husband.

28:25.695 --> 28:27.463
He's a family man.

28:29.532 --> 28:33.633
He's angry, but he's gonna make
the right call.

28:35.104 --> 28:37.141
He'll raise our son.

28:38.007 --> 28:39.107
I'm not worried.

28:42.945 --> 28:45.947
[monitors beeping]

28:49.012 --> 28:51.009
I've made my decision.

28:53.564 --> 28:55.256
I want her taken off life support.

28:55.912 --> 28:57.958
You don't have to decide that right now.

28:57.993 --> 28:58.611
I just did.

28:58.670 --> 29:00.834
Mr. Zarb, you understand the implications?

29:00.913 --> 29:02.644
- I know what this means.
- Your son will die.

29:02.719 --> 29:04.023
Dr. Katz.

29:04.959 --> 29:05.977
I need this to be over.

29:06.049 --> 29:08.519
- Why don't you take some more time?
- No.

29:08.818 --> 29:11.744
I need this to be over.

29:18.229 --> 29:19.713
Okay, we all set?

29:21.883 --> 29:23.683
If her breathing is compromised in any way,

29:23.718 --> 29:25.119
we are putting the tube back in.

29:25.153 --> 29:26.653
Unplug the vent.

29:26.687 --> 29:30.056
[monitor beeping]

29:33.060 --> 29:35.094
[ventilator hissing]

29:39.166 --> 29:40.333
Okay, let's get this tube out.

29:41.335 --> 29:42.635
[air hisses]

29:42.669 --> 29:45.371
I'm here, baby.

29:49.108 --> 29:50.810
Right here.

30:01.475 --> 30:03.308
Well, she's breathing on her own.

30:03.343 --> 30:05.167
That's a good sign.

30:10.149 --> 30:12.416
Then why am I not waking up?

30:13.686 --> 30:15.353
Just keep breathing, baby.

30:15.420 --> 30:17.856
[heart monitor beeping]

30:23.495 --> 30:25.004
So, that's it?

30:25.054 --> 30:26.345
We just throw in the towel?

30:26.400 --> 30:28.029
He's next of kin and the baby's father.

30:28.180 --> 30:28.945
It's his decision.

30:28.995 --> 30:29.767
There is a life in there.

30:29.834 --> 30:31.369
Is no one willing to fight for that?

30:31.436 --> 30:32.703
It's not our fight to have.

30:32.771 --> 30:34.338
Yes, it is. We're doctors.

30:34.406 --> 30:36.006
There's nothing we can do.

30:36.074 --> 30:38.643
[stammers] I don't accept that. I'm sorry.

30:40.245 --> 30:41.745
I'll get started on the paperwork.

30:41.813 --> 30:45.182
Maggie: Thanks.

30:45.352 --> 30:47.084
Your staff ob-gyn... she seems, um...

30:47.152 --> 30:48.652
Young?

30:48.869 --> 30:49.687
Passionate.

30:50.071 --> 30:51.437
That's one word for it.

30:51.782 --> 30:53.788
Better than being unfeeling, I guess.

30:54.140 --> 30:55.092
Right.

30:56.130 --> 30:59.362
I can't keep living
in the same apartment together.

30:59.430 --> 31:01.598
I'm looking for a new place
as fast as I can.

31:03.263 --> 31:04.424
Maybe I'm the one who should, um...

31:04.474 --> 31:06.303
No, no, it's-it's my, uh...

31:06.370 --> 31:08.071
really, I should...

31:08.105 --> 31:09.772
That's the protocol? [chuckles]

31:10.438 --> 31:12.242
The one who gets dumped
gets to keep the apartment?

31:13.121 --> 31:15.761
There is no protocol, unfortunately.

31:16.747 --> 31:19.115
- I still love you.
- Gavin.

31:20.047 --> 31:21.586
I can't pretend that I don't.

31:21.636 --> 31:23.419
I don't know what you want me to say.

31:23.453 --> 31:25.554
[heart monitor beeping]

31:29.492 --> 31:31.060
I should find David.

31:31.672 --> 31:33.787
I-I don't think
he should be alone right now.

31:34.664 --> 31:36.732
[indistinct conversations,
heart monitor beeping]

31:37.317 --> 31:40.769
I need to talk to you. [breathing heavily]

31:41.503 --> 31:42.837
I-I heard.

31:42.871 --> 31:44.439
I'm sorry.

31:44.473 --> 31:46.341
You're my only hope.

31:46.375 --> 31:49.277
Um... I can't leave her.

31:49.912 --> 31:51.512
Nothing's happening.

31:51.547 --> 31:54.983
And it might not happen for weeks... if ever.

31:59.096 --> 32:00.442
Please?

32:01.749 --> 32:03.316
Go with her, Charlie.

32:04.409 --> 32:06.317
Do your ghost-doctor thing.

32:06.941 --> 32:08.095
She needs you.

32:09.049 --> 32:10.665
I'll be here when you get back.

32:23.912 --> 32:25.712
He thinks he's going to turn
into his father,

32:25.747 --> 32:27.681
but it was his mother
who raised him by herself,

32:27.715 --> 32:28.883
worked two jobs.

32:28.917 --> 32:30.550
He's only 50% deadbeat dad.

32:30.585 --> 32:33.053
The other half of him is pretty kick-ass.

32:33.088 --> 32:34.255
Remind him of that.

32:34.289 --> 32:36.556
We don't have much time.

32:36.591 --> 32:39.192
I wish I could remember
the rest of that prayer.

32:39.226 --> 32:41.161
If only mom was here. [chuckles]

32:41.195 --> 32:43.997
You know what? Give her a call.

32:44.031 --> 32:46.232
Oh, she's in a retirement home in Cobourg.

32:46.267 --> 32:48.802
No, I got an excellent
long-distance plan for you.

32:48.836 --> 32:50.704
But I-I haven't been to see her in years.

32:50.738 --> 32:52.972
- I can't...
- Guys, stop the cart for a second, please.

32:53.040 --> 32:55.041
Give her a call.

32:55.918 --> 32:57.652
Roy, make the call.

32:59.746 --> 33:01.314
[exhales sharply]

33:01.348 --> 33:02.816
[buttons clicking]

33:03.730 --> 33:04.717
No, I can't do this.

33:04.751 --> 33:06.052
- What do you mean, you can't do this?
- Talk to her.

33:06.086 --> 33:08.387
Talk to...

33:08.455 --> 33:09.422
[sighs]

33:09.684 --> 33:10.589
Yes. Hello?

33:11.379 --> 33:14.819
Uh... uh, ma'am, my name is Dr. Joel Goran.

33:14.869 --> 33:16.997
I'm calling regarding your son, Roy.

33:17.359 --> 33:18.734
Yeah, he...

33:19.184 --> 33:21.785
no, he's-he's fine.
He's right in front of me here. He...

33:23.966 --> 33:24.554
he's...

33:24.892 --> 33:26.639
okay. One sec.

33:27.493 --> 33:30.274
Uh, she would like to speak with you.

33:34.347 --> 33:37.082
Mom? Hey.

33:37.116 --> 33:38.750
How you doing?

33:38.818 --> 33:39.852
No, no.

33:39.919 --> 33:41.153
I'm good.

33:41.221 --> 33:42.888
I'm real good.

33:42.956 --> 33:46.358
I'm just here at the hospital, volunteering.

33:46.556 --> 33:50.428
Yeah. Y-yeah, Dr. G's like a...
a mentor to me.

33:50.736 --> 33:53.945
Yeah, I've been helping
other people get off of drugs.

33:54.233 --> 33:55.667
[chuckling] Yeah.

33:55.846 --> 33:58.756
Yeah, my luck is finally turning around.

34:00.072 --> 34:01.505
Yeah, no, I...

34:01.573 --> 34:02.606
Yeah, I will.

34:02.640 --> 34:05.042
I-I'll come up and see you real soon.

34:05.110 --> 34:07.111
Well, I better go.

34:07.643 --> 34:08.542
Okay.

34:08.670 --> 34:10.447
Bye, mom.

34:10.514 --> 34:11.916
I love you.

34:15.320 --> 34:17.454
[clears throat]

34:17.522 --> 34:18.722
[chuckling] You think she bought it?

34:18.757 --> 34:21.625
Well, let's make it true, okay?

34:21.659 --> 34:23.659
You're great.

34:24.136 --> 34:25.413
Say it like you mean it.

34:26.311 --> 34:27.347
You're great.

34:27.699 --> 34:29.677
That's much better.
Let's move, boys. Come on.

34:31.668 --> 34:34.304
[indistinct conversations]

34:42.579 --> 34:44.751
Hey, champ. How's the hand?

34:45.176 --> 34:47.284
I don't feel it.

34:47.318 --> 34:48.784
I don't feel anything, actually.

34:49.855 --> 34:53.623
That's because you're in shock,
which is, um,

34:53.690 --> 34:56.893
probably why you shouldn't
be deciding anything right now.

34:56.927 --> 34:59.395
[scoffs] You know, if you
came here to change my mind...

34:59.463 --> 35:02.027
The minute David senses
he's in a fight, he has to win.

35:02.099 --> 35:02.799
Save your breath.

35:02.833 --> 35:03.800
Switch gears.

35:03.867 --> 35:05.755
Uh, a-ask him about his mother.

35:06.143 --> 35:07.222
So, your mother... is she, uh...

35:07.272 --> 35:09.967
She's on a plane from Florida.

35:10.454 --> 35:12.675
I want this taken care of
before she gets here.

35:12.905 --> 35:14.176
He knows she'll try to change his mind.

35:14.210 --> 35:15.564
Afraid she might try and change your mind?

35:15.614 --> 35:17.351
No one's gonna change my mind.

35:17.591 --> 35:18.981
[inhales sharply]

35:19.292 --> 35:21.211
What about your wife?

35:21.741 --> 35:22.884
What would you say to her?

35:22.919 --> 35:24.820
- [scoffs]
- [sighs]

35:24.854 --> 35:25.854
Don't.

35:25.888 --> 35:27.088
- Sorry?
- He's a cynic.

35:27.122 --> 35:28.623
Tell him you talk to ghosts,
and he'll leave.

35:29.013 --> 35:30.659
I-I just mean that, um,

35:30.693 --> 35:34.774
if you could talk to your wife,
what would you say?

35:34.827 --> 35:35.643
With all due respect,

35:35.693 --> 35:37.231
I don't think that's any of your business.

35:37.266 --> 35:38.299
Fair enough.

35:38.334 --> 35:39.634
At our last ultrasound,

35:40.517 --> 35:42.744
we found out we were having a boy.

35:42.968 --> 35:45.400
Hey, when you found out
you were having a son,

35:45.726 --> 35:47.249
that must have been something, right?

35:47.315 --> 35:49.410
I know what you're doing, okay?

35:49.445 --> 35:50.411
Don't.

35:50.446 --> 35:53.014
We ordered pizza, drank.

35:53.048 --> 35:54.248
Well, he did.

35:54.283 --> 35:56.451
No, I-I just mean
that you must have had a...

35:56.518 --> 35:58.318
a few to celebrate.

35:58.353 --> 36:01.088
I was nervous-drinking for three.

36:02.457 --> 36:04.992
He woke me at like 2:00 in the morning

36:05.026 --> 36:08.529
to show me what he'd written
on the back of the pizza box...

36:08.563 --> 36:10.498
for the baby.

36:10.532 --> 36:13.333
You know, when I get drunk,
I, um, pull out the guitar,

36:13.368 --> 36:15.902
turn into Yngwie Malmsteen.

36:15.970 --> 36:17.070
[laughs]

36:17.105 --> 36:18.804
I think I'm Pablo Neruda.

36:21.241 --> 36:24.143
You write any, uh, love poems

36:24.177 --> 36:25.478
when you found out about your son?

36:26.480 --> 36:27.579
How'd you know that?

36:27.647 --> 36:29.515
Just a guess.

36:29.549 --> 36:32.851
What, uh... what did you say to him, David?

36:38.725 --> 36:41.760
"Son... I'll always love you."

36:41.794 --> 36:46.197
"I won't pretend to be
any different than I am."

36:46.265 --> 36:47.966
"Son, you are my son."

36:48.001 --> 36:52.537
"I'll always love you."

36:54.440 --> 36:57.175
I can't remember.

36:58.210 --> 36:59.644
Maybe you're not ready.

37:02.881 --> 37:04.916
No, I made up my mind.

37:04.983 --> 37:06.217

[heart monitor beeping]

37:16.886 --> 37:20.122
David, are you ready?

37:27.296 --> 37:28.997
It's okay.

37:29.869 --> 37:32.167
I'll always love you.

37:38.274 --> 37:42.042
Son, I'll always love you.

37:43.512 --> 37:46.981
Dr. Lin, turn off the vent.

37:47.015 --> 37:49.550
David: Wait.

37:51.219 --> 37:54.622
I-I-I need a minute.

38:05.920 --> 38:07.335
I changed my mind.

38:07.385 --> 38:09.030
Maggie: David?

38:09.853 --> 38:11.893
It's what she would have wanted.

38:13.485 --> 38:15.114
It's what I want.

38:16.575 --> 38:18.168
I want him.

38:21.582 --> 38:23.910
