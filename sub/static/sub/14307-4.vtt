(male narrator)
Previously,

00:04.267 --> 00:06.667
on a very special
Clone High...

00:06.667 --> 00:08.600
Joan made a declaration.

00:08.600 --> 00:10.067
Abe, I want you.

00:10.067 --> 00:13.933
(narrator)
And Abe found a new form
of recreation.

00:13.933 --> 00:15.767
He's not gay or anything.

00:15.767 --> 00:17.267
Abe actually likes Cleo,

00:17.267 --> 00:18.800
a girl.

00:18.800 --> 00:20.933
That was just a hilarious
plot twist.

00:20.933 --> 00:24.000
Hey, you miss an episode,
it's your funeral.

00:24.000 --> 00:26.633
I'm talking to you, Doug.

00:26.633 --> 00:29.733

* Way, way back in the 1980s

00:29.733 --> 00:32.700
* Secret government employees

00:32.700 --> 00:35.500
* Dug up famous
guys and ladies *

00:35.500 --> 00:38.500
* And made amusing
genetic copies *

00:38.500 --> 00:41.433
* Now the clones
are sexy teens now *

00:41.433 --> 00:44.333
* They're going to make it
if they try *

00:44.333 --> 00:47.333
* Loving, learning,
sharing, judging *

00:47.333 --> 00:53.333
* Time to laugh
and shiver and cry *

00:53.333 --> 00:56.100
* Clone High

00:56.100 --> 01:01.733

[marching band playing]

01:05.533 --> 01:06.933
(Gandhi)
Wow.

01:06.933 --> 01:09.600
I've never seen so few fans
at a cross-country meet.

01:09.600 --> 01:10.600
[crowd cheering]

01:10.600 --> 01:13.133
[panting]

01:13.133 --> 01:15.367
Lope, Abe Lincoln, lope.

01:15.367 --> 01:17.267
[panting]

01:17.267 --> 01:18.833
Man, it's hot.

01:18.833 --> 01:21.533
I think I'll pour this
sports drink all over myself.

01:21.533 --> 01:22.533
[drink splashing]

01:22.533 --> 01:24.333
Ooh, it's sticky.

01:24.333 --> 01:25.400
[pants]

01:25.400 --> 01:26.333
[crash]
Dinger!

01:27.467 --> 01:28.733
I won.

01:28.733 --> 01:31.333
And I didn't even
scuff my loafers.

01:31.333 --> 01:32.567
Oh, my God.

01:32.567 --> 01:34.400
We just won a cross-country
dual meet.

01:34.400 --> 01:38.133
Let's destroy property to show
how much we appreciate the team!

01:38.133 --> 01:40.233
(all)
Riot! Riot!

01:40.233 --> 01:42.067
Do it with a stop sign.

01:43.067 --> 01:44.667
[car alarm wailing]

01:44.667 --> 01:45.933
- Yeah, books!
- Riot! Riot!

01:45.933 --> 01:46.933
[explosion booms]

01:46.933 --> 01:49.067
Ready, okay.

01:49.067 --> 01:50.067
[crash, thud]

01:50.067 --> 01:51.067
Riot!

01:51.067 --> 01:52.067
[crash]

01:52.067 --> 01:53.067

Riot! Riot!

01:53.067 --> 01:55.067
Yeah, books!

Riot! Riot!

Flip the pool!

02:05.333 --> 02:06.333

02:06.333 --> 02:07.467
Thank you!

[bricks thud]

02:11.933 --> 02:13.833
[heavy metal music]

02:13.833 --> 02:16.067
Those loveable scamps.

02:16.067 --> 02:18.567
They're rioting
at a college level.

02:18.567 --> 02:19.733
[crash, thud]

02:19.733 --> 02:21.067
Riot!

02:21.067 --> 02:22.267
[distant screaming]

02:22.267 --> 02:23.500
(Mr. Sheepman)
Now, let's talk about

02:23.500 --> 02:26.200
yesterday's horrifying
shenanigans,

02:26.200 --> 02:28.933
and feel free to say anything,
'cause today,

02:28.933 --> 02:32.300
I'm gonna be your "care-iff,"
you see.

02:33.867 --> 02:35.467
Okay.
Moving on.

02:35.467 --> 02:37.667
I know teenagers
have an awful lot

02:37.667 --> 02:42.233
of confusing feelings,
but today it is unlawful

02:42.233 --> 02:43.733
to bottle 'em up.

02:43.733 --> 02:46.133
You got to let 'em out!

02:46.133 --> 02:48.867
Like I do, every night
between 10:00 and 10:15

02:48.867 --> 02:50.667
on a pillow
shaped like my father.

02:51.733 --> 02:53.433
So let's brainstorm

02:53.433 --> 02:56.533
some constructive ways
we can express ourselves.

02:56.533 --> 02:58.700
Uh, Joan of Arc makes movies.

02:58.700 --> 03:00.633
Uh, I make films,
'kay?

03:00.633 --> 03:01.633
On video.

03:01.633 --> 03:03.433
Experimental video art

03:03.433 --> 03:05.267
technically not
intended for audiences.

03:05.267 --> 03:06.867
Okay, wonderful.

03:06.867 --> 03:08.767
Making films is a...

03:08.767 --> 03:11.300
is a--is a relatively
inexpensive way

03:11.300 --> 03:13.667
to express oneself,
I guess.

03:13.667 --> 03:15.067
I'd like to help.

03:15.067 --> 03:17.567
I was on that
cross-country team.

03:17.567 --> 03:20.533
For this reason,
I hereby volunteer

03:20.533 --> 03:22.333
to organize the first annual

03:22.333 --> 03:24.367
Take Back the Afternoon
film festival

03:24.367 --> 03:26.500
to save Clone High!

03:26.500 --> 03:28.100
Fantastic.

03:28.100 --> 03:30.700
Now we'll never have
another riot.

03:30.700 --> 03:31.833
[eerie music]

03:31.833 --> 03:33.300
Listen, we've all done things

03:33.300 --> 03:35.100
we're not proud of after
a good cross-country meet.

03:35.100 --> 03:36.767
But that riot was unacceptable.

03:36.767 --> 03:38.100
Unacceptable?

03:38.100 --> 03:39.567
Did you see the pool?

03:39.567 --> 03:41.133
They flipped the bitch.

03:41.133 --> 03:43.700
Principal Scudworth, if you were
running this school properly,

03:43.700 --> 03:44.767
there would be no riots,

03:44.767 --> 03:46.133
only clone soldiers trained

03:46.133 --> 03:48.633
for superior intellectual
and physical combat.

03:48.633 --> 03:49.867
Little do they know

03:49.867 --> 03:52.567
I have my own plans
for these clones,

03:52.567 --> 03:55.867
plans that don't involve
these Shadowy Figures at all.

03:55.867 --> 03:57.200
[laughs]

03:57.200 --> 03:59.100
You're talking in a normal
indoor speaking voice.

04:00.700 --> 04:03.600
So I am.

04:03.600 --> 04:05.167
[whispering]
Little do they know

04:05.167 --> 04:07.200
I have my own plans
for these--

04:07.200 --> 04:08.400
Scudworth.

04:08.400 --> 04:10.167
You're walking
on thin ice, man,

04:10.167 --> 04:11.933
clone of Karen Carpenter thin.

04:11.933 --> 04:14.667
I think this is an issue
we should talk about...

04:14.667 --> 04:17.067
in person.

04:17.067 --> 04:19.300
Maybe we could have dinner.

04:19.300 --> 04:21.167
Perhaps the Olive Garden.

04:21.167 --> 04:23.333
It's like eating
in the private kitchen

04:23.333 --> 04:26.067
of a delightful
Italian stereotype.

04:26.067 --> 04:29.433
We were thinking
somewhere more intimate.

04:29.433 --> 04:30.767
Your house.
Next Friday.

04:30.767 --> 04:32.300
No dairy.

04:32.300 --> 04:33.300
Please.

04:33.300 --> 04:34.367
[TV buzzes off]

04:34.367 --> 04:35.567
Damn it!

04:35.567 --> 04:36.800
I haven't been

04:36.800 --> 04:39.200
to the Olive Garden
in, like, forever!

04:39.200 --> 04:40.667
[gentle music]

04:40.667 --> 04:41.667
[door creaks]

04:41.667 --> 04:43.067
[cheers and applause]

04:43.067 --> 04:45.933
Mr. Butlertron, my bosses
are coming over for dinner

04:45.933 --> 04:47.900
and look at this place.

04:47.900 --> 04:50.467
I haven't changed a thing
since I got my degree

04:50.467 --> 04:53.633
in the mad sciences
from ASU!

04:53.633 --> 04:56.067
[electronic voice]
Maybe some
overpriced knickknacks

04:56.067 --> 04:57.933
will add a touch of class.

04:57.933 --> 04:59.367
They've got
a great selection

04:59.367 --> 05:02.467
down at Restoration Pottery Pier
and Barrel.

05:02.467 --> 05:06.100
Are you thinking what
I'm programmed to be thinking?

05:06.100 --> 05:08.567
(both)
Shopping spree!

05:08.567 --> 05:09.833
[laughter]

05:09.833 --> 05:10.833

05:10.833 --> 05:11.833
Shaka braddah!

05:11.833 --> 05:13.067
George Washington
Carver!

05:13.067 --> 05:14.667
Damn it,
Gandhi.

05:14.667 --> 05:16.267
You know how I hate
to be interrupted

05:16.267 --> 05:17.500
while I'm in
my peanut lab.

05:17.500 --> 05:18.867
Okay, check this out.

05:18.867 --> 05:21.100
I have this ass-kicking idea
for the film fest.

05:21.100 --> 05:23.100
It's about these two cops,
and they're different,

05:23.100 --> 05:24.667
but in many ways,
they're the same.

05:24.667 --> 05:26.133
It's starring me,
and check this out.

05:26.133 --> 05:27.733
- It's starring you.
- No.

05:27.733 --> 05:30.633
See, it's two different cops
from two different precincts

05:30.633 --> 05:33.433
learning to fight crime
together as buddies.

05:33.433 --> 05:34.433
Please go
away.

05:34.433 --> 05:35.433
Check this out.

05:35.433 --> 05:36.700
You play Leon Black,

05:36.700 --> 05:39.233
and I'm Tandoori Jones.

05:39.233 --> 05:40.800
And you won't believe
what it's called.

05:40.800 --> 05:42.567
- Black and Tan?
- Black and Tan!

05:42.567 --> 05:44.300
High five!
Racial pride!

05:44.300 --> 05:48.067
I don't like those
movies, Mahatma.

05:48.067 --> 05:49.433
They're filled
with bad dialogue

05:49.433 --> 05:50.700
and trite plot twists,

05:50.700 --> 05:52.233
and they perpetuate
racial stereotypes.

05:52.233 --> 05:53.300
[paper rustles]

05:53.300 --> 05:54.667
Nah, dog.

05:54.667 --> 05:57.267
See, this is about dissing
racial stereotypes.

05:57.267 --> 05:58.800
You know the old one about
how Indians and Blacks

05:58.800 --> 06:00.133
don't get along?

06:00.133 --> 06:01.167
No.

06:01.167 --> 06:02.500
Well, Black and Tan will prove

06:02.500 --> 06:03.733
that even though
we're different,

06:03.733 --> 06:06.167
we're ultimately
a hilarious combo.

06:06.167 --> 06:08.433
Good day, Gandhi.

06:08.433 --> 06:10.267
Good day.

06:10.267 --> 06:11.367
There's a part for the peanut.

06:13.067 --> 06:15.433
We're listening.

06:15.433 --> 06:17.233
[laughs]

06:17.233 --> 06:20.867
[rock music]

06:20.867 --> 06:22.133
Next.

06:22.133 --> 06:23.967
[whispering]
Thank God I got the key

06:23.967 --> 06:25.533
to this editing room.

06:25.533 --> 06:27.100
Oh, yeah.

06:27.100 --> 06:28.933

06:28.933 --> 06:30.200
[gentle music]

06:30.200 --> 06:31.600
(Joan)
Wow.

06:31.600 --> 06:33.567
Clip art.

06:33.567 --> 06:36.900
You know, I'm glad we get
to spend some time alone.

06:36.900 --> 06:37.900
Hi, Abe.

06:37.900 --> 06:39.200
My film is really
coming along.

06:39.200 --> 06:40.600
I'm doing an autobiography
called

06:40.600 --> 06:41.800
The Best of the Best
of the Best

06:41.800 --> 06:43.200
of the Best
of the Best.

06:43.200 --> 06:45.400
The whole premise is
how tough it is to be me.

06:45.400 --> 06:46.500
Popular,
smart,

06:46.500 --> 06:47.500
well-traveled,

06:47.500 --> 06:48.833
and incredibly
well-endowed

06:48.833 --> 06:49.967
boob-wise.

06:49.967 --> 06:51.700
Hey, is there a time limit
on the films?

06:51.700 --> 06:53.467
Would you tell
a sunset

06:53.467 --> 06:55.967
that it couldn't
last forever?

06:55.967 --> 06:58.067
Sunsets last
six minutes.

06:58.067 --> 06:59.333
Does a sunset
have a soundtrack

06:59.333 --> 07:01.400
featuring
Smash Mouth?

07:01.400 --> 07:02.933
See ya.

07:02.933 --> 07:04.067
And, Abe,

07:04.067 --> 07:05.567
I'll see you...

07:05.567 --> 07:07.600
at the movies.

07:07.600 --> 07:09.733
Wow.

07:09.733 --> 07:11.300
[gasps]

07:11.300 --> 07:13.433
[whimpers]

07:13.433 --> 07:14.867
[sobbing]

07:14.867 --> 07:18.733
Joan!

07:18.733 --> 07:21.633
[panting]

07:21.633 --> 07:23.967
Joan, thank God
you're okay.

07:23.967 --> 07:25.967
I've been looking all over
the restaurant for you.

07:25.967 --> 07:29.100
Abe, we put out an APB
on your missing friend.

07:29.100 --> 07:31.233
It's okay, officer.
I found her.

07:31.233 --> 07:32.933
What are you
doing here?

07:32.933 --> 07:33.967
It's not safe.

07:33.967 --> 07:35.833
This table's not
even bussed.

07:35.833 --> 07:36.867
[sighs]

07:36.867 --> 07:38.533
I don't know how to say this.

07:38.533 --> 07:40.600
You don't have to.

07:40.600 --> 07:42.567
You think the film fest
is too commercial.

07:42.567 --> 07:44.567
- I do?
- Yes.

07:44.567 --> 07:47.233
Film at Clone High used to be
just you and Andy Warhol

07:47.233 --> 07:48.967
and your disturbing art films.

07:48.967 --> 07:51.333
But now Cleo's got her epic,
Gandhi's doing his cop movie,

07:51.333 --> 07:54.167
and Mother Teresa's got that
teen slasher sex romp.

07:54.167 --> 07:56.167
But it's not about them.

07:56.167 --> 07:58.267
This festival's
all about you,

07:58.267 --> 07:59.267
Joan.

07:59.267 --> 08:00.700
Me?

08:00.700 --> 08:01.767
Abe?

08:01.767 --> 08:04.800
You and me
and what you have

08:04.800 --> 08:05.800
here...

08:05.800 --> 08:06.800
[moans]

08:06.800 --> 08:08.500
Heart-wise.

08:08.500 --> 08:09.767
Like my film.

08:09.767 --> 08:11.467
It's everything
I've been wadding up

08:11.467 --> 08:13.733
in the sad chamber
of my heart.

08:13.733 --> 08:16.133
And now I'm shooting that wad.

08:16.133 --> 08:17.933
In 35 millimeter.

08:17.933 --> 08:19.333
Joan, isn't there
just one thing

08:19.333 --> 08:22.067
in that beautiful
and honest heart of yours

08:22.067 --> 08:23.433
that you need
to express?

08:23.433 --> 08:24.433
Yes, Abe.

08:24.433 --> 08:25.433
I love--

08:25.433 --> 08:27.167
Shh.

08:27.167 --> 08:28.967
- Don't tell me.
- Mm?

08:28.967 --> 08:30.500
- Show me...
- Mm.

08:30.500 --> 08:32.867
In your film.

08:35.500 --> 08:37.833
Well,
I'll see you guys.

08:43.300 --> 08:44.400
[rock music]

08:44.400 --> 08:45.567
(Ang)
Okay, now, Cleo, baby.

08:45.567 --> 08:47.167
This is the shot
where you reveal

08:47.167 --> 08:49.667
how difficult
your life really is.

08:49.667 --> 08:50.667
And go.

08:50.667 --> 08:53.067
Oh, I'm sorry, Ang.

08:53.067 --> 08:54.467
Am I having a nightmare?

08:54.467 --> 08:55.733
Because if I was awake,

08:55.733 --> 08:57.467
those cue cards would be
written in calligraphy!

08:57.467 --> 08:58.700
Oh, my God.

08:58.700 --> 09:00.233
I am so sorry.

09:00.233 --> 09:02.167
Get the hell out of here.

09:02.167 --> 09:03.867
You are not my son.

09:03.867 --> 09:04.933
[whimpers]

09:04.933 --> 09:07.300
Okay, remember,
you're Gabe.

09:07.300 --> 09:08.600
Gabe

09:08.600 --> 09:10.300
[French accent]
"Link-on."

09:10.300 --> 09:12.100
Now, your motivation
is that you're in love

09:12.100 --> 09:13.467
with your best friend,

09:13.467 --> 09:15.333
but you just
haven't told her yet.

09:15.333 --> 09:16.333
And go.

09:16.333 --> 09:17.467
Line.

09:17.467 --> 09:19.533
[scoffs]
There is no line right now.

09:19.533 --> 09:20.833
You just scream
and weep.

09:20.833 --> 09:22.100
And go.

09:22.100 --> 09:25.300
[screaming]

09:25.300 --> 09:28.200
Ah, boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo.

09:28.200 --> 09:30.500
At first, I thought
you were whack, Black.

09:30.500 --> 09:33.733
But now, we've both learned
that when East meets West,

09:33.733 --> 09:35.233
it's deadly.

09:35.233 --> 09:37.567
(Peanut)
Uno momento,
Black and Tan.

09:37.567 --> 09:38.567
[suspenseful music]

09:38.567 --> 09:40.167
Eat shell!

09:40.167 --> 09:43.167

09:43.167 --> 09:46.167
[laughing maniacally]

09:46.167 --> 09:49.067
[dramatic music]

09:49.067 --> 09:51.267
Go to hell,
Señor Peanie!

09:51.267 --> 09:54.400
Last one there's a rotten heuvo.

09:54.400 --> 09:57.867
[laughing maniacally]

09:57.867 --> 09:58.900
Say what?

09:58.900 --> 09:59.900
(Gandhi)
Cut.

09:59.900 --> 10:01.133
No, no,
no, man.

10:01.133 --> 10:02.933
You're making me
fall asleep.

10:02.933 --> 10:04.600
To death, bro.

10:04.600 --> 10:06.600
Okay, the line is,

10:06.600 --> 10:08.500
"Say wha-a-a-at?"

10:08.500 --> 10:10.400
- "Say what?"
- "Say wha-a-a-at?"

10:10.400 --> 10:11.867
- "Say what?"
- "Say"...

10:11.867 --> 10:13.500
- "Say"...
- "Wha-a-a-at?"

10:13.500 --> 10:14.600
- "What?"
- "Say wha-a-a-at?"

10:14.600 --> 10:16.167
Gandhi!

10:16.167 --> 10:17.833
This character is not me.

10:17.833 --> 10:19.400
- Say wha-a-a-t?
- Stop it!

10:19.400 --> 10:20.533
Listen!

10:20.533 --> 10:22.600
You and I
don't get along.

10:22.600 --> 10:24.300
I'm off the project.

10:27.700 --> 10:31.167
Watch out for that water tower!

10:31.167 --> 10:32.367
[dramatic music]

10:32.367 --> 10:34.233
[Gandhi grunts]

10:34.233 --> 10:36.800
[water tower crashes]

10:36.800 --> 10:38.600
Wow, G-Dub.

10:38.600 --> 10:40.567
You saved my life.

10:40.567 --> 10:43.367
Hey man, would you stay
if I rewrote your character?

10:43.367 --> 10:44.733
No.

10:44.733 --> 10:46.600
I'll rewrite it.

10:46.600 --> 10:48.700
My way.

10:48.700 --> 10:51.900
Say wha-a-a-at?

10:51.900 --> 10:54.500
Remember, this film
is my heart.

10:54.500 --> 10:57.667
I want your voice to weep
with honesty and truth

10:57.667 --> 10:59.833
and all that is real
in this world.

10:59.833 --> 11:01.667
And go.

11:01.667 --> 11:03.167
[deadpan] There's nothing
in the rulebook

11:03.167 --> 11:04.833
that says a giraffe
can't play football.

11:04.833 --> 11:06.267
No, feel it!

11:06.267 --> 11:08.367
[deadpan, slower]
There's nothing in the rulebook

11:08.367 --> 11:12.133
that says a giraffe
can't play football.

11:12.133 --> 11:15.067
[clapping slowly]

11:16.367 --> 11:18.433
[gentle music]

11:18.433 --> 11:20.867
Get out your fun-brella,
Mr. B.,

11:20.867 --> 11:23.633
because it's raining style.

11:23.633 --> 11:25.233
(male singer)
* When you need a new start

11:25.233 --> 11:26.433
* Just look in your heart

11:26.433 --> 11:28.967
* And begin the redecoration

11:28.967 --> 11:30.800
* Your problems will end

11:30.800 --> 11:32.167
* When you start to spend

11:32.167 --> 11:34.533
* On a rug from
a third world nation *

11:34.533 --> 11:37.800
* We're expressing ourselves *

11:37.800 --> 11:39.533
* Expressing ourselves

11:39.533 --> 11:40.533
[Joan grunts]

11:40.533 --> 11:42.067
* Sometimes it's fun *

11:42.067 --> 11:43.133
* When you are young

11:43.133 --> 11:46.167
* To bottle up your emotions

11:46.167 --> 11:47.567
* But then you realize

11:47.567 --> 11:48.833
* We're all gonna die *

11:48.833 --> 11:51.533
* If we don't get
into the motion *

11:51.533 --> 11:53.467
* Of expressing ourselves

11:53.467 --> 11:54.733
* Do it right

11:54.733 --> 11:57.067
* Working real hard
all through the night *

11:57.067 --> 11:59.500
* To let everybody know

11:59.500 --> 12:02.267
* Who we are

12:02.267 --> 12:05.300
* Who we are

12:05.300 --> 12:08.467
* Who we are

12:08.467 --> 12:10.300
* Expressing yourself

12:10.300 --> 12:12.100
[machinery whirring]

12:12.100 --> 12:13.967
Well, there it is.

12:13.967 --> 12:15.433
I'm finished.

12:15.433 --> 12:16.700
(JFK)
Well, I'm not.

12:16.700 --> 12:18.433
Keep it down
over there.

12:18.433 --> 12:21.067
Finally, a film
that perfectly expresses

12:21.067 --> 12:22.900
all of my feelings for Abe.

12:22.900 --> 12:24.067
Hey, Joan.

12:24.067 --> 12:25.467
What was that you were
saying quietly?

12:25.467 --> 12:27.067
Abe!
Hi.

12:27.067 --> 12:28.167
I just finished my film,

12:28.167 --> 12:29.900
and it really expresses
my true--

12:29.900 --> 12:31.433
I'm so
proud of you.

12:31.433 --> 12:33.933
Opening yourself up and
expressing what's inside--

12:33.933 --> 12:36.167
you're such an honest
and true friend.

12:36.167 --> 12:37.233
Friend?

12:37.233 --> 12:38.600
It's been hard
for me because

12:38.600 --> 12:40.967
I'm trying to win over Cleo
and run the film fest.

12:40.967 --> 12:42.100
But knowing
that I have you

12:42.100 --> 12:44.067
as a pal gives me
the strength to do it.

12:44.067 --> 12:46.067
- Pal?
- Don't worry, bro.

12:46.067 --> 12:47.300
Cleo will never
take your place

12:47.300 --> 12:48.467
as my best friend.

12:48.467 --> 12:49.600
Bro?

12:49.600 --> 12:51.367
Yeah, even closer
than a sister.

12:51.367 --> 12:53.467
So close that we could
sleep in the same bed

12:53.467 --> 12:54.533
and never touch or kiss.

12:54.533 --> 12:55.600
So anyway,

12:55.600 --> 12:58.867
thanks for expressing
yourself, man.

12:58.867 --> 13:00.100
Man.

13:00.100 --> 13:02.533
[whooshing]

13:02.533 --> 13:03.800
[crash]

13:03.800 --> 13:06.100
Joan, I almost forgot
to pick up your--

13:06.100 --> 13:07.967
Amigo? Buddy? Fella?

13:07.967 --> 13:08.967
Where are you, guy?

13:08.967 --> 13:10.133
[melancholy music]

13:10.133 --> 13:13.067
Hey, what's this?

13:13.067 --> 13:15.800
You're going to express
yourself, Joan,

13:15.800 --> 13:18.333
even if I have
to do it for you.

13:18.333 --> 13:19.833
[inhales deeply]

13:19.833 --> 13:21.500
(JFK)
Do you mind?

13:21.500 --> 13:25.067
Some of us are nailing
Catherine the Great here.

13:25.067 --> 13:28.900
Or should I say
Catherine the So-So?

13:38.533 --> 13:40.667
Wha--

13:40.667 --> 13:42.433
Abe, Abe, Abe,

13:42.433 --> 13:43.633
why is my name
on the program?

13:43.633 --> 13:45.700
Because it deserves to be.

13:45.700 --> 13:47.333
I found your film
in the trash can,

13:47.333 --> 13:48.500
and I submitted it.

13:48.500 --> 13:50.667
No, no, you don't
understand, Abe.

13:50.667 --> 13:52.867
This film is embarrassing...

13:52.867 --> 13:54.333
[whispering]
For both of us.

13:54.333 --> 13:57.133
How could I be embarrassed
by a friend?

13:57.133 --> 13:58.533
Pow, pow-pow, pow, pow.

13:58.533 --> 13:59.533
Who's got the legs?

13:59.533 --> 14:01.100
Me, that's who, me.

14:01.100 --> 14:02.533
Who knows, Joan?

14:02.533 --> 14:06.133
Maybe your film
will change the world.

14:06.133 --> 14:08.600
[whispering]
That's what I'm afraid of.

14:08.600 --> 14:10.900
[banging]
- Open up, Thomas Edison!

14:10.900 --> 14:12.733
I know what you're
after, Joan.

14:12.733 --> 14:13.733
[snorts]

14:13.733 --> 14:14.833
And you're not
gonna get it.

14:14.833 --> 14:16.700
But you don't
understand.

14:16.700 --> 14:18.167
Or do I?
[snorts]

14:18.167 --> 14:19.167
No!

14:19.167 --> 14:20.167
Or is it yes?

14:20.167 --> 14:22.200
No!
Let me in!

14:22.200 --> 14:24.267
You can try
all you want, Joan.

14:24.267 --> 14:25.367
[snorts]

14:25.367 --> 14:26.700
But we both know that
even an angry woman

14:26.700 --> 14:28.933
can't claw through steel
that's 2 feet thick.

14:32.067 --> 14:34.233
Well, the apartment's
all finished.

14:34.233 --> 14:36.800
I couldn't have done it
without you, Mr. B.

14:36.800 --> 14:38.200
And speaking of without you,

14:38.200 --> 14:39.767
go hide in the kitchen.

14:39.767 --> 14:41.933
But Wesley--

14:41.933 --> 14:45.333
My entire career is riding on
the success of this dinner.

14:45.333 --> 14:47.833
And I don't need
the electronic help

typical Indian supercop

this caper.

And speaking
of capers,

15:39.367 --> 15:42.100
I thought we ordered
from a deli.

Oh, it's from a deli

I have your baby in me,
giraffe!

16:39.633 --> 16:41.300
[dramatic musical flourish]

16:41.300 --> 16:42.867
[projector whirring]

16:42.867 --> 16:45.267
[applause,
indistinct murmuring]

16:45.267 --> 16:46.267
Wow.

16:46.267 --> 16:48.067
[exhales]

16:48.067 --> 16:49.800
Single tear.
[chuckles]

16:49.800 --> 16:51.800
Okay.
[chuckles]

16:51.800 --> 16:54.367
Our next film, by Cleopatra,
is titled

16:54.367 --> 16:56.467
The Best of the Best of the--

16:56.467 --> 16:57.467
Oh, my God!

16:57.467 --> 16:58.467
[crash]

16:58.467 --> 17:00.400
Ow.

17:00.400 --> 17:02.633
Damn coal-powered projectors.

17:02.633 --> 17:03.833
[snorts]

17:03.833 --> 17:05.567
Well, all of the films
are ruined...

17:05.567 --> 17:07.400
There is no God!

17:07.400 --> 17:09.067
There is a God!

17:09.067 --> 17:12.333
Except Joan's film, which is
somehow expanded in the fire

17:12.333 --> 17:14.233
and will now be seen
in wide-screen.

17:14.233 --> 17:15.233
[snorts]

17:15.233 --> 17:16.800
[grunts]
There is no God.

17:16.800 --> 17:19.067
This is
a sign, Joan.

17:19.067 --> 17:20.367
If you don't
express yourself,

17:20.367 --> 17:21.733
you'll just keep
saying, "Fine"

17:21.733 --> 17:23.467
when someone asks you
how you are.

17:23.467 --> 17:24.767
And then one day,
someone will say,

17:24.767 --> 17:25.933
"How are you, Joan?"

17:25.933 --> 17:28.067
And you know what
your answer will be?

17:28.067 --> 17:29.333
There won't be one,

17:29.333 --> 17:31.100
because you'll be dead.

17:33.333 --> 17:34.300
[crickets chirping,
dog barks]

17:38.067 --> 17:39.333
So...

17:39.333 --> 17:41.867
Religion's
for fools, eh?

17:41.867 --> 17:43.767
Fools and
liberals.

17:48.400 --> 17:50.867
[tender piano music]

17:50.867 --> 17:52.433
(Mr. Butlertron)
Hello.

17:52.433 --> 17:54.233
Am I in space?

17:54.233 --> 17:57.933
Because you all look
out of this world.

17:57.933 --> 18:01.533
[laughter]

18:01.533 --> 18:04.267
[creaks]

18:04.267 --> 18:06.267
Board of
Shadowy Figures,

18:06.267 --> 18:08.500
I'd like you to meet
Mr. Butlertron,

18:08.500 --> 18:12.967
my butle--
no, my friend.

18:12.967 --> 18:14.633
Well, Scudworth,
I must confess

18:14.633 --> 18:16.867
we actually came
to dinner tonight to kill you.

18:16.867 --> 18:18.133
[laughter]

18:18.133 --> 18:19.467
But we've had
such a wonderful time

18:19.467 --> 18:22.133
that we're going
to give you another chance.

18:22.133 --> 18:23.900
Oh, Mr. B.

18:23.900 --> 18:25.633
You've done
it again.

18:25.633 --> 18:27.467
[applause]

18:27.467 --> 18:31.067
Look, I think it's obvious
what this is about,

18:31.067 --> 18:34.067
so let's just get it over with.

18:34.067 --> 18:35.933
[solemn violin music]

18:35.933 --> 18:37.767
Whisper,
whisper.

18:37.767 --> 18:38.933
Hush,
hush.

18:38.933 --> 18:40.400
[clock ticking]

18:40.400 --> 18:43.767
[dolphins chattering]

18:43.767 --> 18:46.500
[screaming]

18:46.500 --> 18:48.100
Ah, boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo.

18:48.100 --> 18:50.400
[distorted whimpering]

18:50.400 --> 18:52.733
Celine Dion-athon,
Celine Dion-athon.

18:52.733 --> 18:55.333
[railroad crossing bell dinging]

18:55.333 --> 18:56.533
[distorted moaning]

18:56.533 --> 18:57.533
[zap]

18:57.533 --> 18:58.600
[whirring and buzzing]

18:58.600 --> 18:59.600
[fire whooshes]

18:59.600 --> 19:01.067
[violin music]

19:01.067 --> 19:02.167
[coughing]

19:02.167 --> 19:03.500
[bag pipe blares off-key]

19:03.500 --> 19:05.067
[telephone rings]

19:05.067 --> 19:06.667
Whisper.

19:06.667 --> 19:09.233
[distorted, drawn-out]
Whisper.

19:09.233 --> 19:10.800
Whisper.

19:10.800 --> 19:12.067
(both)
Paella.

19:12.067 --> 19:13.200
[slap]

19:13.200 --> 19:15.933
- Shh.
[eerie violin music]

19:15.933 --> 19:20.200
[projector whirring]

19:20.200 --> 19:21.500
(all)
Huh.

19:21.500 --> 19:24.500
Ha, ha, ha-ha-ha!
You love Abe!

19:24.500 --> 19:26.067
[sighs]
Go away, Sigmund Freud.

19:26.067 --> 19:28.067
Could it be
any more obvious?

19:28.067 --> 19:29.167
Hmm-hmm-hmm,
hmm, hmm, hmm.

19:29.167 --> 19:30.867
- Hmm-hmm-hmm--
[metal clangs]

19:30.867 --> 19:32.667
Well, that's it.

19:32.667 --> 19:35.867
Wasn't this
the best film fest ever?

19:35.867 --> 19:37.267
(audience)
Yeah!

19:37.267 --> 19:39.600
I can't hear you, Clone High.

19:39.600 --> 19:41.800
[all chanting]
Film fest! Film fest!

19:41.800 --> 19:44.100
Film fest! Film fest!

19:44.100 --> 19:46.100
Film fest!
Film fest!

19:46.100 --> 19:47.933
Film fest! Film fest!

19:47.933 --> 19:49.100
Film fest!
Film fest!

Film fest! Film fest!

19:51.300 --> 19:52.967
[gentle acoustic guitar music]

19:52.967 --> 19:55.833
So I guess things
are totally different now.

19:55.833 --> 19:57.133
Not really.

19:57.133 --> 19:58.233
Everyone's still
rioting.

19:58.233 --> 20:00.300
No, I mean my film.

20:00.300 --> 20:03.067
Now you know the truth
about how I feel.

20:03.067 --> 20:05.400
Uh...
yeah.

20:05.400 --> 20:07.467
And it doesn't
change things?

20:07.467 --> 20:08.800
Uh...

20:08.800 --> 20:10.300
no?

20:10.300 --> 20:13.067
Thanks for not
making this too weird.

20:13.067 --> 20:14.633
I just felt so exposed

20:14.633 --> 20:18.000
because mine was the only film
that was truly personal.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.100
What?

20:19.100 --> 20:21.133
Did you watch
my movie, Joan,

20:21.133 --> 20:23.267
or did you
just see it?

20:23.267 --> 20:25.833
Unlike you, I didn't make
a beeline for the obvious.

20:25.833 --> 20:28.433
I used a little something
called symbolism.

20:28.433 --> 20:32.267
You see, Joan,
I was that giraffe.

20:32.267 --> 20:33.333
Wow.

20:33.333 --> 20:35.500
So if you were
the giraffe,

20:35.500 --> 20:38.167
who was that
little girl?

20:38.167 --> 20:39.667
Good night, Joan.

20:39.667 --> 20:41.800
Good night.

20:41.800 --> 20:43.500
*

20:43.500 --> 20:46.467

Next time, on a very special
Clone High...

20:52.033 --> 20:55.900
JFK and Cleo
break up for reals.

20:55.900 --> 20:58.367
Joan and Cleo duke it out

20:58.367 --> 20:59.733
lady style.

20:59.733 --> 21:02.600
And something tragic
may or may not happen.

21:02.600 --> 21:04.100
[car crashes]

21:04.100 --> 21:07.067
(Abandoned Pools singing)
* Way, way back in the 1980s

21:07.067 --> 21:09.633
* Secret government
employees *

21:09.633 --> 21:12.533
* Dug up famous
guys and ladies *

21:12.533 --> 21:15.433
* And made amusing
genetic copies *

21:15.433 --> 21:18.367
* Now the clones
are sexy teens now *

21:18.367 --> 21:21.233
* They're going to
make it if they try *

21:21.233 --> 21:24.167
* Loving, learning,
sharing, judging *

21:24.167 --> 21:30.367
* Time to laugh and
shiver and cry *

21:30.367 --> 21:33.533
* Clone High
