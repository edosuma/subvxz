WEBVTT

00:01.635 --> 00:03.569
(sirens blaring)

00:03.571 --> 00:05.637
(engine revving,
tires squealing)

00:09.577 --> 00:11.310
(tires squealing)

00:11.312 --> 00:13.245
What are they doing?

00:13.247 --> 00:15.247
Jess, I think
we're done.

00:15.249 --> 00:18.350
(sirens blaring)

00:19.487 --> 00:21.487
WOMAN:
Terry, look!

00:21.489 --> 00:22.721
Look, they're gonna shoot.

00:22.723 --> 00:24.590
They're gonna kill us. Aah!

00:24.592 --> 00:26.625
Cover's blown.
Lewis, you got no time.

00:26.627 --> 00:29.395
(sirens blaring)

00:30.264 --> 00:31.697
Take the shot, Lew.

00:31.699 --> 00:32.664
(gun chamber clicking)

00:32.666 --> 00:34.500
Hold on to Owen! Hold on!

00:34.502 --> 00:36.168
What are they doing?!
We have a baby!

00:36.170 --> 00:37.736
(sirens blaring)

00:40.674 --> 00:42.775
(sniffling and crying)

00:48.082 --> 00:50.682
Hey, Jess?

00:50.684 --> 00:52.684
Jess, are you there?

00:54.355 --> 00:56.522
Jess, it's me.

00:57.625 --> 00:59.658
Look, I-I know you're there,

00:59.660 --> 01:01.693
so just listen.

01:01.695 --> 01:06.732
I'm not saying you don't got
every right to be pissed, but

01:06.734 --> 01:08.734
what I've been through

01:08.736 --> 01:11.270
in these last
few months--

01:11.272 --> 01:12.704
it's made me realize,

01:12.706 --> 01:16.275
and you know,
it's made me see.

01:16.277 --> 01:18.377
I've changed,

01:18.379 --> 01:20.412
and I'm ready.

01:20.414 --> 01:23.715
And I just want to be with
you and our baby boy.

01:23.717 --> 01:25.818
(sniffling)

01:26.854 --> 01:28.387
Jess?

01:28.389 --> 01:30.422
(knocking)

01:33.160 --> 01:35.360
(panting)

01:35.362 --> 01:38.730
What's... What's wrong?

01:38.732 --> 01:41.200
(voice breaking):
He's gone, Terry.

01:41.202 --> 01:43.669
I gave him up.

01:43.671 --> 01:46.138
(crying):
I gave our baby away.

01:46.140 --> 01:48.140
What?

01:48.142 --> 01:49.842
(crying)

01:49.844 --> 01:51.243
(grunts)

01:51.245 --> 01:52.678
Is that the guy? Good.

01:52.680 --> 01:54.746
It's good when they run, huh?

01:54.748 --> 01:56.381
Yeah.

01:56.383 --> 01:58.550
Save some for the rest of us.

01:58.552 --> 01:59.718
Will do.

01:59.720 --> 02:01.420
Four arrests, one warrant.

02:01.422 --> 02:02.754
I know what you're thinking.

02:02.756 --> 02:04.623
"That is some kind
of record, Ed.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.158
How do you do it?"

02:06.160 --> 02:07.459
Well, Greg, I find that...

02:07.461 --> 02:08.627
How's she doing?

02:08.629 --> 02:09.795
(sighs)

02:09.797 --> 02:11.230
She's fine.

02:11.232 --> 02:13.699
PARKER: She shot a cop in
the line of duty.

02:13.701 --> 02:15.267
She did her job.

02:15.269 --> 02:17.769
And you're saying she's got
no reaction, no issues?

02:17.771 --> 02:19.171
No, I'm s...

02:19.173 --> 02:20.772
Look,

02:20.774 --> 02:23.842
you cut me some slack
when I had issues.

02:23.844 --> 02:26.411
She deserves the same.

02:26.413 --> 02:28.480
(garbled radio transmission)

02:29.884 --> 02:31.717
I told you I was pregnant.

02:31.719 --> 02:33.218
You went out for smokes,

02:33.220 --> 02:35.587
and, what, how many months later
you come back?

02:35.589 --> 02:37.222
That's messed up.

02:39.293 --> 02:42.728
I was just...
doing a lot of thinking.

02:42.730 --> 02:44.796
Yeah, well, so was I.

02:46.767 --> 02:48.534
(sniffles)

02:48.536 --> 02:50.435
They made
this introduction book.

02:50.437 --> 02:53.305
The agency showed it to me.

02:53.307 --> 02:57.442
Look at the house they got
on Bridlepath.

02:57.444 --> 03:02.381
I never even been up there.

03:02.383 --> 03:06.218
And then I told myself,
"Doesn't he deserve that?"

03:06.220 --> 03:08.887
You know,
when he was born, I...

03:08.889 --> 03:11.256
Something in me just said,
"This is wrong."

03:11.258 --> 03:13.425
And then I was trying
to tell myself

03:13.427 --> 03:14.760
that the feelings were wrong,

03:14.762 --> 03:17.196
that it was... that it was
the right thing to do.

03:17.198 --> 03:19.731
And I tried calling them once,

03:19.733 --> 03:22.401
to change my mind, but you
only have three weeks,

03:22.403 --> 03:24.503
and it was one
past, so I just...

03:24.505 --> 03:26.905
It's... I mean,
it was the right thing to do.

03:26.907 --> 03:30.409
It was just the right thing
to do, but...

03:30.411 --> 03:32.377
(sniffles)

03:32.379 --> 03:34.446
Terry, I'm so sorry.

03:34.448 --> 03:35.647
(crying)

03:35.649 --> 03:37.649
No. No. No. No.

03:37.651 --> 03:39.751
I'm the one who left.

03:39.753 --> 03:44.256
I'm the one who spent the
last two years a mess.

03:44.258 --> 03:45.924
But you...

03:45.926 --> 03:50.295
You don't have a
thing to be sorry for.

03:50.297 --> 03:52.931
Except for maybe hooking up
with me in the first place.

03:55.269 --> 03:57.669
But I'm here now.

03:57.671 --> 03:59.705
And if you'll let me,

03:59.707 --> 04:01.840
I want to make this work.

04:07.715 --> 04:09.815
Does he have a name?

04:09.817 --> 04:11.350
I don't know.

04:11.352 --> 04:13.685
Well, what were you
gonna name him?

04:13.687 --> 04:15.854
Owen.

04:15.856 --> 04:17.990
Really?

04:17.992 --> 04:19.958
Yeah.

04:19.960 --> 04:24.029
Can we just do one last thing?

04:26.667 --> 04:28.533
Come on, sweetie.

04:29.837 --> 04:31.353
(doorbell ringing)

04:31.354 --> 04:32.870
Terry, I don't think
it's such a good idea.

04:32.873 --> 04:34.339
You said
they were nice people.

04:34.341 --> 04:35.507
Nice people aren't

04:35.509 --> 04:37.576
gonna say no.

04:39.813 --> 04:41.346
Hi, Jessie.

04:41.348 --> 04:42.714
Uh...

04:42.716 --> 04:44.016
what's this about?

04:44.018 --> 04:45.884
It-It's Andrew, right?

04:45.886 --> 04:48.053
Hey, look, Andrew,

04:48.055 --> 04:49.421
I'm-I'm Terry.

04:49.423 --> 04:50.722
I-I'm the father of...

04:51.992 --> 04:53.625
Look, I...

04:53.627 --> 04:56.361
Look, I know
this is a bit weird, but

04:56.363 --> 04:57.896
we just...
we just wanted to know

04:57.898 --> 05:00.532
if we could see... if we could
see our baby. Your baby,

05:00.534 --> 05:01.867
I mean.
Absolutely not.

05:01.869 --> 05:04.036
It was never part
of the arrangement, so, uh...

05:04.038 --> 05:06.438
Andrew, who is it?

05:06.440 --> 05:07.839
(whispers):
Let's just go.

05:07.841 --> 05:09.608
It's, uh...

05:09.610 --> 05:11.777
Jessie.
(baby cooing)

05:11.779 --> 05:12.944
MRS. GREENWOOD:
Hi, Jessie.

05:12.946 --> 05:15.080
It's all right, Andrew.

05:15.082 --> 05:17.916
Is everything okay?

05:17.918 --> 05:19.985
(baby cooing and crying)

05:25.859 --> 05:28.927
Well, you look so...

05:28.929 --> 05:30.729
so happy. That's great.

05:30.731 --> 05:31.997
MRS. GREENWOOD:
Yeah.

05:31.999 --> 05:34.833
Thanks to you
and your decision.

05:34.835 --> 05:38.003
So, uh, what'd
you name him?

05:38.005 --> 05:39.371
Liam.

05:39.373 --> 05:40.772
Huh.

05:40.774 --> 05:41.973
What's that, Jewish?

05:41.975 --> 05:43.375
Irish.
Nice.

05:43.377 --> 05:45.077
Yeah. Well...

05:45.079 --> 05:46.078
(clears throat)

05:46.080 --> 05:47.612
Listen, I think
it's, uh...

05:47.614 --> 05:49.981
Well, it's about time
to wrap it up, okay?

05:49.983 --> 05:51.016
Okay.

05:51.018 --> 05:52.351
Can I hold him?

05:52.353 --> 05:54.019
Oh, uh...
I don't...
(clears throat)

05:54.021 --> 05:55.554
I don't think we're comfortable.

05:55.556 --> 05:56.922
Please, I'm never gonna...

05:56.924 --> 05:58.790
I'm never gonna see him again.

05:58.792 --> 05:59.891
I just want to...

05:59.893 --> 06:01.760
Just once before we go.

06:01.762 --> 06:03.128
Please?

06:03.130 --> 06:05.997
Um...

06:05.999 --> 06:07.032
Please?

06:07.034 --> 06:08.900
Okay.

06:08.902 --> 06:10.068
Okay.

06:10.070 --> 06:11.670
Just watch his head.

06:11.672 --> 06:12.904
Okay.
(baby cooing)

06:12.906 --> 06:15.507
You got him?
Yeah.

06:15.509 --> 06:16.675
Huh, Terry?

06:16.677 --> 06:18.744
(baby coos)

06:22.049 --> 06:23.448
Hey.

06:26.487 --> 06:29.654
I... I think...

06:29.656 --> 06:30.822
(clears throat)

06:30.824 --> 06:32.691
...it's time
for Owen to come home.

06:32.693 --> 06:35.460
Owen?

06:35.462 --> 06:37.529
Well, Terry, what are you
talking about?
Okay.

06:37.531 --> 06:39.431
Andrew...
Yeah, yeah-- it's okay.

06:39.433 --> 06:41.933
Okay, you have
exactly one minute

06:41.935 --> 06:43.802
to get the hell
out of our house.

06:43.804 --> 06:46.538
No, I'm sorry, but
Jessie's changed her mind.

06:46.540 --> 06:48.540
Isn't that right, Jessie?

06:48.542 --> 06:50.108
No, I-I...
Jessie.

06:50.110 --> 06:52.978
Jessie, okay, you had your three
weeks, okay, Jessie?

06:52.980 --> 06:54.012
It's, it's the law.

06:54.014 --> 06:55.447
Right, you can look it up.

06:55.449 --> 06:56.982
MRS. GREENWOOD:
You are so young.

06:56.984 --> 06:59.117
You can have another baby.

06:59.119 --> 07:01.520
We already have a baby.

07:01.522 --> 07:03.021
And we're not leaving
without him.

07:03.023 --> 07:05.757
Yes, you are.
Yes, you are.
Hey!

07:05.759 --> 07:06.958
Once we get a lawyer...

07:06.960 --> 07:08.527
Lawyer? Wait a minute.

07:08.528 --> 07:10.095
Okay, I am a lawyer, all right?
You're going to do what?

07:10.097 --> 07:11.196
What lawyer
do you have?

07:11.198 --> 07:13.865
You think you're
so much better than me.

07:13.867 --> 07:14.866
Terry!

07:14.868 --> 07:17.169
Okay, I...
ANDREW:
Calm down.

07:17.170 --> 07:19.471
Okay, I... I just think
I've spent more time with

07:19.473 --> 07:22.107
the baby, and that makes me more
of a father to him than you are.

07:22.109 --> 07:24.709
You want to see what kind
of father I am? Huh?

07:24.711 --> 07:26.645
Terry, stop it!

07:26.647 --> 07:29.147
Andrew!
Get the hell out

07:29.149 --> 07:30.148
of our house, okay?!

07:30.150 --> 07:32.784
No! Not without our boy.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.686
No, Terry!
Go get Owen!

07:35.722 --> 07:37.923
(baby cries)

07:40.494 --> 07:44.162
(Mrs. Greenwood sobbing)

07:44.164 --> 07:45.664
OPERATOR (over speaker):
911?

07:45.666 --> 07:47.732
(faint crying)

07:48.802 --> 07:50.469
Cindy!

07:50.471 --> 07:51.803
Move!
Listen, you're upset.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.071
I've been there,
all right?
You don't know me!

07:53.073 --> 07:54.473
I know what it's like, okay?

07:54.475 --> 07:56.041
I know what it's like
to want a child

07:56.043 --> 07:57.543
more than anything else...
Shut up!

07:57.544 --> 07:59.044
It makes you do crazy
things, it does, okay?

07:59.046 --> 08:01.380
You don't know me! Shut up!

08:01.381 --> 08:03.715
Terry, there's a two-way alarm
in the nursery, okay?

08:03.717 --> 08:05.183
The police are going
to hear everything you say.

08:05.185 --> 08:06.117
Shut up!

08:06.119 --> 08:08.253
(groans, grunts)

08:11.124 --> 08:13.725
Get the hell
out of my house.

08:20.501 --> 08:22.267
I'm sorry.

08:24.738 --> 08:26.872
Jessie!

08:30.844 --> 08:32.911
(sirens blaring)

08:36.850 --> 08:38.917
Okay, we've got a home invasion
in progress.

08:38.919 --> 08:40.585
Unis are on their way,
and it sounds like

08:40.587 --> 08:42.187
there's a child
on the scene.

08:42.189 --> 08:44.723
Winnie, let's hear
the live feed from
the home security.

08:44.725 --> 08:45.790
Patch that through.

08:48.228 --> 08:49.528
Cindy!

08:49.530 --> 08:51.062
You get out of my house!
(baby crying)

08:51.064 --> 08:52.731
Is he okay?

08:52.733 --> 08:54.566
(cries):
Andrew!

08:54.568 --> 08:55.767
I got their car keys.

08:55.769 --> 08:57.068
Oh, my God!
Let's get Owen.

08:57.070 --> 08:59.237
No, no! We-We can't do that.

08:59.239 --> 09:01.940
(groaning)

09:01.942 --> 09:04.276
You see this?

09:04.278 --> 09:06.144
Why shouldn't this be us?

09:06.146 --> 09:07.245
CINDY (over speaker):
Andrew!

09:07.247 --> 09:08.747
Andrew, help me!

09:08.749 --> 09:11.283
We-We just want to make sure
the baby's okay, Cindy.

09:11.285 --> 09:14.886
You tell me my husband's okay!
What did you do to him?

09:14.888 --> 09:16.655
TERRY (over speaker):
Cindy, open the door!

09:16.657 --> 09:17.889
Less lethal all around.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.090
No Tasers, no gas.

09:19.092 --> 09:21.293
Wait for weapons on my go,
and nothing--

09:21.295 --> 09:23.828
repeat, nothing-- till we get
a 20 on that baby.

09:23.830 --> 09:25.297
Copy.

09:25.299 --> 09:27.999
Cindy, open the door!
Terry...

09:28.001 --> 09:30.201
(screams)

09:30.203 --> 09:31.736
Sounds like
it's escalating.

09:31.737 --> 09:33.270
We've got to move
fast on scene.
Spike, Lewis,

09:33.273 --> 09:34.906
approach on black.
Copy that.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.241
Got it.
CINDY:
Jessie, get out!

09:36.243 --> 09:37.676
You get out! Get out!

09:37.678 --> 09:39.644
Cindy, we're not
going to hurt you, okay?

09:39.646 --> 09:41.246
Donna, Wordy,
you've got white.

09:41.248 --> 09:43.181
CINDY: Where is Andrew?!
Shields on everyone.

09:43.183 --> 09:44.282
Where is he?

09:44.284 --> 09:45.684
Winnie, it sounds like
the homeowners

09:45.686 --> 09:47.018
know who the invaders are.

09:47.020 --> 09:48.286
Let's see what
their connection is.

09:48.288 --> 09:49.921
Why the care for the child?

09:49.923 --> 09:53.291
Homeowners are
Andrew and Cindy Greenwood.

09:53.293 --> 09:55.327
Checking for a Terry
and Jessie now.

09:55.329 --> 09:57.162
CINDY:
The police can hear everything.

09:57.164 --> 09:58.163
They're on their way.

09:58.165 --> 10:00.365
They're coming. No!

10:00.367 --> 10:02.133
Get away from that!

10:02.135 --> 10:04.202
We just lost audio, folks

10:04.204 --> 10:06.171
No, please, please,
please don't do this.

10:06.173 --> 10:09.074
Okay? Okay?
It's not safe for him.

10:09.076 --> 10:11.142
What, do you think
I'm going to hurt him?

10:11.144 --> 10:13.078
He's my boy.
(crying continues)

10:13.080 --> 10:14.312
Give him to me, please, okay?

10:14.314 --> 10:17.816
No, no.
No, no, no, no.

10:17.818 --> 10:20.318
Give us our boy, now!
Cindy!

10:20.320 --> 10:23.154
You want to see Andrew again,
give us our baby!

10:23.156 --> 10:24.756
Cindy...
(crying continues)

10:24.758 --> 10:26.257
Give him to me, okay?

10:26.259 --> 10:28.326
(whimpering)

10:31.698 --> 10:34.366
See? He needed his mommy.

10:34.368 --> 10:36.067
Okay, baby.

10:36.069 --> 10:38.203
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay,
okay-- we've got to go.

10:38.205 --> 10:40.171
What do we need? What do we
need? What do we need?

10:40.173 --> 10:42.207
Um, uh... I don't know.

10:42.209 --> 10:43.341
I don't know.
What do we need?

10:43.343 --> 10:45.210
What do we need?!
Okay.

10:45.212 --> 10:47.045
Okay, okay-- it's cold.

10:47.047 --> 10:48.713
You'll have to put him in this.

10:49.683 --> 10:51.750
(Cindy cries)

10:54.354 --> 10:56.955
Okay. You need a blanket.

10:56.957 --> 10:58.223
You take this one.

10:58.225 --> 11:02.060
I just washed it.
And a bottle.

11:02.062 --> 11:03.695
Greenwoods just went
through an adoption.

11:03.697 --> 11:05.296
Took official custody
two months ago.

11:05.298 --> 11:07.198
Can't get the name
of the biological mother,

11:07.200 --> 11:09.367
maybe two more minutes.
That's why the concern.
It's hers.

11:09.369 --> 11:10.335
Jessie.

11:10.337 --> 11:12.237
Jessie, look
at me, Jessie.

11:12.239 --> 11:13.905
Please don't
do this.

11:13.907 --> 11:15.206
You can come and see
him whenever you want.

11:15.208 --> 11:17.208
You can come every
day, I swear to God.

11:17.210 --> 11:19.210
We can work
something out.

11:19.212 --> 11:22.447
I'm sorry, Cindy, but he needs
to be with his mommy.

11:22.449 --> 11:24.716
He needs to be with people
that really love him.

11:24.718 --> 11:25.717
Okay?

11:25.719 --> 11:27.152
We do.

11:27.154 --> 11:28.987
We do, we love him.

11:28.989 --> 11:30.422
Come on, baby, we got to go now.

11:30.424 --> 11:31.723
We've got to go
right now.

11:31.725 --> 11:33.992
No, no, no,
Jessie, no.

11:33.994 --> 11:35.827
Please!

11:35.829 --> 11:39.397
  Captioning sponsored by
  CBS

12:12.499 --> 12:15.166
Go, go, go, go, go.

12:15.168 --> 12:18.169
(keyless entry chirps)
Got their car
keys; let's go.

12:19.106 --> 12:21.773
(baby cooing)

12:25.245 --> 12:27.812
WINNIE:
Team, neighbors just called in

12:27.814 --> 12:29.948
Greenwoods' minivan--
silver, light gray BMW,

12:29.950 --> 12:31.916
just pulled away.

12:34.187 --> 12:35.520
I got 'em right here
in the intersection.

12:35.522 --> 12:38.123
If they run, we ram 'em
before they leave the scene.

12:38.125 --> 12:39.057
Copy that.

12:39.059 --> 12:41.092
(siren wailing)
Terry.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.244
(tires screeching)

12:43.245 --> 12:45.395
Donna, possible baby on board.
Stand down, stand down.

12:45.398 --> 12:46.431
The baby.
(brakes screeching)

12:46.433 --> 12:47.899
Terry, no!

12:47.901 --> 12:49.968
(tires screeching,
sirens wailing)

12:55.776 --> 12:57.842
ED: Team one,
we've got a vehicular pursuit.

12:57.844 --> 12:59.427
Standard formation
to start,

12:59.428 --> 13:01.011
but if there is a baby on
board, it changes everything.

13:01.014 --> 13:02.147
Sabine, you good to go?

13:02.149 --> 13:03.882
I'm on it.

13:03.884 --> 13:05.416
(tires screeching)

13:07.187 --> 13:09.821
(sirens wailing)

13:20.167 --> 13:22.167
I'm GPS'ing the area now.

13:22.169 --> 13:24.169
Okay, if they have the baby,
we're limited here.

13:24.171 --> 13:27.338
No road spikes, no collisions,
no shooting out the tires.

13:27.340 --> 13:30.074
Unis at the house confirm
baby has been taken.

13:30.076 --> 13:32.010
Ed, how about
a rolling roadblock?

13:32.012 --> 13:33.378
Negative, we got
a school zone coming up.

13:33.380 --> 13:35.180
Copy.
Can you make contact?

13:35.182 --> 13:36.848
Winnie, I need to know
who these folks are.

13:36.850 --> 13:42.020
Okay. Two names-- Jessie Wyeth
and Terry, no surname yet.

13:42.022 --> 13:43.354
Wyeth's 19,

13:43.356 --> 13:44.355
biological mother.

13:44.357 --> 13:45.590
Gave her baby up two months ago.

13:45.592 --> 13:47.926
Possible postpartum depression,

13:47.928 --> 13:50.028
separation anxiety,
maybe psychosis.

13:50.030 --> 13:51.029
How about the male?

13:51.031 --> 13:52.497
Nothing yet; I'm on it.

13:52.499 --> 13:55.033
Okay, does she have parents
of her own we can contact?

13:55.035 --> 13:57.869
Wyeth's mother's listed
as deceased three years ago--

13:57.871 --> 13:59.237
overdose.

13:59.239 --> 14:01.172
No father I can find.

14:01.174 --> 14:03.842
This girl is alone except
for that guy and this baby.

14:03.844 --> 14:05.276
ED:
They're turning on to Bayview.

14:05.278 --> 14:07.345
(sirens wailing)

14:15.989 --> 14:18.189
What's going on?

14:18.191 --> 14:19.424
What do you think is going on?

14:19.426 --> 14:20.959
They're still coming.

14:20.961 --> 14:22.527
Fine, let
'em come,

14:22.529 --> 14:25.430
give us a nice police escort
right to the lawyer's office.

14:25.432 --> 14:28.032
What lawyer, Terry?

14:28.034 --> 14:29.334
Terry, what lawyer?!
(baby screams)

14:29.336 --> 14:31.002
Krugman-- we'll
go see him!
No,

14:31.004 --> 14:32.570
you still owe him
for the last time, remember?!

14:32.572 --> 14:34.305
The robbery thing.

14:34.307 --> 14:36.307
It wasn't robbery, it was
theft under a thousand.
Shh...

14:36.309 --> 14:38.176
Porter-- we can
see if she can help.

14:38.178 --> 14:40.011
No, she said
you couldn't call her anymore.

14:40.013 --> 14:41.479
You know,
if we're going to be a family,

14:41.481 --> 14:44.015
you're going to have to have
this stuff thought out, Terry.

14:44.017 --> 14:45.016
I'm thinking!

14:45.018 --> 14:47.018
Don't scream.

14:47.020 --> 14:48.152
You're scaring him.

14:48.154 --> 14:50.255
(sirens wailing)

14:50.257 --> 14:53.191
(phone ringing)
(baby fussing)

14:53.193 --> 14:55.593
Shh...

14:55.595 --> 14:57.362
It's the police.

14:59.900 --> 15:02.200
You tell them we're not
getting out of this van

15:02.202 --> 15:03.234
until we got a lawyer.

15:03.236 --> 15:05.270
Hello?

15:05.272 --> 15:07.906
Hi. My name is
Sergeant Gregory Parker.

15:07.908 --> 15:09.908
I'm with the Police
Strategic Response Unit.

15:09.910 --> 15:11.910
Am I speaking with Jessie Wyeth?

15:11.912 --> 15:14.345
Yes. I'm so sorry, you're gonna
have to speak up here.

15:14.347 --> 15:16.381
Oh, it sounds like you've got
your hands full over there.

15:16.383 --> 15:17.282
That's a hungry cry.

15:17.284 --> 15:18.917
How do you know?

15:18.919 --> 15:20.351
I'll never forget that sound.

15:20.353 --> 15:22.153
Your baby wants a bottle.

15:22.155 --> 15:23.221
What's your baby's name?

15:23.223 --> 15:25.290
His name is Owen.

15:25.292 --> 15:27.425
So what do you say, Jessie?

15:27.427 --> 15:29.260
Shh! It's okay, baby.
We all stop,

15:29.262 --> 15:30.745
get Owen some formula?

15:30.746 --> 15:32.229
Maybe you could tell us
your side of things?

15:32.232 --> 15:35.166
No, we-we have the formula
in the diaper bag.

15:35.168 --> 15:38.336
But Terry says we can't stop
until we have a lawyer.

15:38.338 --> 15:40.271
Okay, I can work on that,

15:40.273 --> 15:42.407
but it'll be a lot easier
for me to do

15:42.409 --> 15:44.609
if we aren't speeding
down the highway.

15:44.611 --> 15:46.311
Be safer too, for Owen.

15:46.313 --> 15:49.047
Terry, I think we should stop.
What's he saying to you?

15:49.049 --> 15:50.315
Whatever he's saying,
you know he's lying.

15:50.317 --> 15:53.117
JESSIE:
No, he's just saying
we should stop.

15:53.119 --> 15:55.353
It'd be safe for Owen.
Yeah. And then we stop,
and they get him,

15:55.355 --> 15:56.688
and where do
you think he's going?

15:56.690 --> 15:58.690
You wanna call Tami
and ask her right now?

15:58.692 --> 16:00.358
No. He's not going to Tami.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.126
Yeah, 'cause I'm not
going to let that happen!

16:02.128 --> 16:03.261
Shh!
Now hang up the phone!

16:03.263 --> 16:05.263
Terry...
Hang up the phone!

16:05.265 --> 16:06.564
Okay. I'm-I'm sorry.

16:06.566 --> 16:08.232
Jessie, don't hang up.

16:08.234 --> 16:09.367
Please, we need a lawyer.

16:09.369 --> 16:10.601
(fussing)
Shh. It's okay.

16:10.603 --> 16:12.670
All right, let's go
to plan B.

16:12.672 --> 16:14.605
Lewis, you ready with
that GPS launcher?

16:14.607 --> 16:16.407
Yes, sir.

16:16.409 --> 16:18.576
Spike, get in position.

16:18.578 --> 16:19.677
Aim for the rear bumper.

16:19.679 --> 16:21.312
Copy that.

16:21.314 --> 16:23.581
If we can make this work, Lew,
we can back off.

16:23.583 --> 16:26.284
Donna, we're the
distraction, on my go.

16:26.286 --> 16:29.320
(sirens wailing)

16:29.322 --> 16:32.023
(tires squealing)

16:33.994 --> 16:35.360
Go now.

16:37.097 --> 16:39.063
What are they doing?

16:39.065 --> 16:41.099
Jessie, I think
we're done...

16:45.238 --> 16:47.238
JESSIE:
Terry, look!

16:47.240 --> 16:50.375
They're gonna shoot!
They're gonna kill us!

16:50.377 --> 16:52.410
Cover's blown, Lewis.
You got no time.

16:56.082 --> 16:58.316
Take the shot, Lew.

16:58.318 --> 17:02.020
Hold on to Owen! Hold on!
What are they doing?!
We have a baby!

17:03.790 --> 17:05.490
Got it.

17:05.492 --> 17:07.325
It's holding, boss.
All good.

17:07.327 --> 17:08.359
Good.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.361
Signal's up.

17:10.363 --> 17:11.462
All right.

17:11.464 --> 17:13.131
We got him
tagged with the GPS.

17:13.133 --> 17:14.465
Let's see where he's going...

17:14.467 --> 17:15.366
Spike, I'm gonna fall back.

17:15.368 --> 17:16.434
Copy that.

17:19.639 --> 17:22.173
PARKER:
We're gonna pull back,
let them slow down,

17:22.175 --> 17:24.308
and keep that baby safe.
DONNA:
Copy that.

17:24.310 --> 17:26.277
SPIKE:
Copy. Falling back.

17:29.682 --> 17:32.383
TERRY:
Jess, it's okay, we lost 'em.

17:32.385 --> 17:34.652
I think we need to stop this.

17:34.654 --> 17:37.188
All I want is what
everybody wants.

17:37.190 --> 17:39.190
I know. I want that, too,
but, I mean...

17:39.192 --> 17:41.392
(baby crying)

17:47.534 --> 17:51.102
All that time I was away,
all I could think of was you.

17:51.104 --> 17:52.370
Us and him all together.

17:52.372 --> 17:54.105
Where were you, Terry?

17:54.107 --> 17:57.075
What did you do?

17:58.411 --> 18:01.512
Boss, the girl listed
a "Terry Dornan"

18:01.514 --> 18:03.514
as next of kin
on her hospital form.

18:03.516 --> 18:05.116
That's great, Winnie.
Go ahead.

18:05.118 --> 18:06.751
If this is him,
he's got a record,

18:06.753 --> 18:09.087
and a long history
of violence.

18:09.089 --> 18:12.290
Listen to this-- two months ago
he almost killed a guy.

18:20.400 --> 18:23.367
Terry Sebastian Dornan,
20 years old.

18:23.369 --> 18:26.504
Last few months--
he was in jail for assault.

18:26.506 --> 18:28.439
"On the 15th of June,
police were called

18:28.441 --> 18:31.476
"to 1678 Ossington,
where Mr. Dornan

18:31.478 --> 18:33.244
"and an acquaintance,
Kurt Lawford,

18:33.246 --> 18:35.346
"shared an apartment.

18:35.348 --> 18:36.447
"Upon arriving,
police noted blood

18:36.449 --> 18:38.116
on the walls, floor,
and ceiling..."

18:38.118 --> 18:39.650
Jess, I can do this
for you and him,

18:39.652 --> 18:41.352
but I just want to do
one more thing.

18:41.354 --> 18:43.488
I really think we should
stop now, Terry.

18:43.490 --> 18:44.990
Please, just one more thing.

18:44.991 --> 18:46.491
Then we'll go downtown
and we'll turn ourselves in.

18:46.493 --> 18:47.792
Okay, one more thing.

18:51.698 --> 18:53.231
(beeping)

18:53.233 --> 18:54.499
Boss, we lost 'em.

18:54.501 --> 18:56.167
Yeah.

18:57.370 --> 18:59.403
ED:
I see 'em.

18:59.405 --> 19:01.472
I'm taking the off-ramp.

19:01.474 --> 19:05.610
PARKER:
Okay, team, let's take
the next exit and look back.

19:05.612 --> 19:09.580
TERRY:
I just want to do one thing
as a family, Jess.

19:09.582 --> 19:11.482
It'll be great.
You'll see.

19:11.484 --> 19:12.650
Okay?

19:21.227 --> 19:23.694
Team, any eyes on the subject?

19:23.696 --> 19:25.530
Negative.

19:25.532 --> 19:27.598
Winnie, you still
trying that number?

19:27.600 --> 19:29.233
No answer last four times.

19:29.235 --> 19:30.468
Okay, keep trying.

19:30.470 --> 19:32.270
Anything else on Dornan?

19:32.272 --> 19:33.671
Background, family, anything?

19:34.841 --> 19:36.807
Both parents are dead.

19:36.809 --> 19:38.509
Though they didn't
die together.

19:38.511 --> 19:41.245
Mother died-- looks like some
sort of car accident.

19:41.247 --> 19:42.680
He was four.

19:42.682 --> 19:45.316
Father-- I'm just getting a date

19:45.318 --> 19:47.285
almost a year later.

19:47.287 --> 19:49.754
After that, I'm getting multiple
addresses for Dornan--

19:49.756 --> 19:52.490
over ten-- till he was 18.

19:52.492 --> 19:55.493
Yeah, those aren't relatives,
those are foster homes.

19:55.495 --> 19:57.261
Let's keep looking, guys.

20:04.470 --> 20:06.571
Terry, what are we doing?

20:13.580 --> 20:15.313
Terry...

20:15.315 --> 20:17.548
(baby fussing)

20:19.519 --> 20:21.485
Terry, we can't go in there.

20:21.487 --> 20:24.689
Just trust me. It's gonna be
great. He's gonna love it.

20:24.691 --> 20:27.458
(cell phone ringing)

20:32.532 --> 20:34.432
(crying)

20:36.636 --> 20:38.302
Look, we're okay.

20:38.304 --> 20:39.570
Boss, I got her.

20:39.572 --> 20:41.522
Here she is.

20:41.523 --> 20:43.473
Jessie,
hey, it's Greg Parker again.

20:43.476 --> 20:45.343
I'm really glad to hear
that you're okay.

20:45.345 --> 20:46.677
So where are you?

20:46.679 --> 20:48.546
We're at...

20:48.548 --> 20:51.515
We're safe, okay.

20:51.517 --> 20:52.617
We're gonna turn ourselves in.

20:52.619 --> 20:54.518
We just need to do
this one thing.

20:54.520 --> 20:56.587
Owen's still hungry, huh?

20:56.589 --> 20:58.322
How you coming with
that formula?

20:58.324 --> 21:01.425
I don't know how to make it.

21:01.427 --> 21:04.595
I should know this!

21:04.597 --> 21:06.798
What am I doing?

21:06.799 --> 21:09.000
Jessie, you know who was born
knowing this stuff?

21:09.002 --> 21:10.468
Nobody.

21:10.470 --> 21:12.536
(grunting)

21:14.774 --> 21:16.607
Having a baby, that's one thing,

21:16.609 --> 21:18.909
but taking care of him, honey,
that's something else.

21:18.911 --> 21:20.578
You can't do it on the run.

21:20.580 --> 21:22.546
Yeah, well, if I was
a real mother,

21:22.548 --> 21:23.948
you know, I would have learned.

21:23.950 --> 21:26.317
I wouldn't have
just given him up.

21:26.319 --> 21:28.853
Or-or you knew what
your baby would need

21:28.855 --> 21:31.856
and you made sure he got it,
like a real mother would.

21:31.858 --> 21:34.859
So, Jessie, why don't you
tell me where you are?

21:36.729 --> 21:39.697
We're at
the Northern Dreampark, okay?

21:39.699 --> 21:41.465
Yeah.
We're almost done.

21:41.467 --> 21:42.867
And then we're coming
in downtown.

21:44.437 --> 21:45.770
Okay, Jessie,
just stay on the line.

21:45.772 --> 21:47.071
I gotta go.

21:47.073 --> 21:49.006
(metal bar clanging)

21:51.611 --> 21:53.944
Eddie, Northern Dreampark.

21:53.946 --> 21:55.012
Copy that.

21:55.014 --> 21:56.614
Let's step on it, folks.

21:56.616 --> 21:58.616
Ready?

21:58.618 --> 21:59.784
(baby crying)

21:59.786 --> 22:01.018
Terry, can we go now?

22:01.020 --> 22:02.653
Yeah.

22:03.589 --> 22:05.589
What's this?

22:05.591 --> 22:07.692
It's just one last thing.

22:07.694 --> 22:08.993
Oh!
I know exactly
where it is.

22:08.995 --> 22:09.927
He's gonna love it.

22:09.929 --> 22:10.928
Terry, come on.

22:10.930 --> 22:12.763
Please?
Let's just go.

22:12.765 --> 22:14.865
Please?

22:16.102 --> 22:17.935
Please?

22:17.937 --> 22:19.804
Terry...

22:26.679 --> 22:29.113
(grunting)

22:33.119 --> 22:35.119
(baby fussing)

22:38.624 --> 22:39.824
Come on.

22:42.428 --> 22:46.630
I can't wait for you
to see this. And Owen, too.

23:02.949 --> 23:04.682
Winnie, Jessie mentioned
a "Tami,"

23:04.684 --> 23:06.417
some connection to Dornan.

23:06.419 --> 23:08.018
Find out what it is.

23:08.020 --> 23:09.153
I'm on it.

23:09.155 --> 23:11.422
What do you think?

23:14.961 --> 23:16.627
Well?

23:16.629 --> 23:18.529
Yeah, it's pretty.

23:18.531 --> 23:20.164
Come on. Come on.

23:20.166 --> 23:22.099
All right, I'm Sierra One.

23:22.100 --> 23:24.033
Spike and Lewis, Alpha Team,
west side of the park.

23:24.036 --> 23:26.637
Wordy, Donna, east side
of the park, Bravo Team.

23:26.639 --> 23:27.638
Weapons?

23:27.640 --> 23:29.407
Look, Dornan may not be armed,

23:29.409 --> 23:31.675
but he's violent and he's
unstable, so Tasers if we can.

23:31.677 --> 23:33.210
What about long range?

23:33.211 --> 23:34.744
Rubber bullets.
That baby is the priority.

23:34.747 --> 23:36.914
If he gives us no choice,
we do what we got to do.

23:36.916 --> 23:38.849
Clear.
Clear.
I don't think...

23:38.851 --> 23:41.786
Guys, get going.

23:41.788 --> 23:43.154
Donna, you got a problem?

23:43.156 --> 23:45.756
No, I'm good.

23:45.758 --> 23:46.690
You sure?

23:46.692 --> 23:47.825
Yep.

23:47.827 --> 23:49.827
(guns cocking)

23:52.465 --> 23:54.498
Let's go!

23:54.767 --> 23:56.467
You all right?

23:56.469 --> 23:57.468
Yeah. You good?

23:57.470 --> 23:58.803
Yeah, cool.
All right.

24:05.912 --> 24:08.746
Here, give him to me.

24:08.748 --> 24:11.148
Please?
You sure?

24:12.685 --> 24:15.553
Okay, okay, Terry,

24:15.555 --> 24:16.854
watch his head,
watch his head.

24:16.856 --> 24:18.889
I got it, I got it, I got it.

24:27.099 --> 24:29.834
PARKER:
Okay, team, keep me posted.

24:29.836 --> 24:31.869
Nothing yet, boss.

24:31.871 --> 24:34.505
No joy here, either.

24:37.677 --> 24:39.677
Go down here?
Yeah.

24:40.947 --> 24:45.082
You know, when your daddy
was almost four,

24:45.084 --> 24:48.586
his mommy and his daddy
came here.

24:48.588 --> 24:52.957
And your daddy,
well, he thought

24:52.959 --> 24:56.494
the whole world lived
in this park.

24:56.496 --> 24:59.897
And at the center
of this world

24:59.899 --> 25:04.635
was the most beautiful thing
he had ever seen:

25:04.637 --> 25:09.640
horses and families
and everybody together.

25:09.642 --> 25:11.809
(baby coos)

25:17.617 --> 25:19.850
PARKER: Eddie, I'm about to talk
to this Tami,

25:19.852 --> 25:22.186
see what more we can get
on our subject here.

25:22.188 --> 25:24.255
If you see him,
let me know right away.

25:24.257 --> 25:25.789
Copy that.

25:30.930 --> 25:33.964
No, I've spent more time
in court with him

25:33.966 --> 25:36.233
than all my other kids
combined.

25:36.235 --> 25:37.801
What'd he do now?

25:37.803 --> 25:39.837
How long did he live with you?

25:39.839 --> 25:42.840
Two years. The time he was 16
to the time he walked out.

25:42.842 --> 25:44.108
Can't say I was sorry.

25:44.110 --> 25:45.910
That's quite a handful, huh?

25:45.912 --> 25:48.812
(laughs) No, a handful's what
I'm used to.

25:48.814 --> 25:50.648
You ever spend the night
with a baby

25:50.650 --> 25:52.816
who's not getting his crack
from mommy's milk?

25:52.818 --> 25:54.818
<i> That</i> I'm used to.

25:54.820 --> 25:57.121
Now, when Terry came,
everybody said,

25:57.123 --> 25:59.757
"Look, this
is a really hard one."

25:59.759 --> 26:02.927
And I said, "Yeah, hard or not,
every kid wants love,

26:02.929 --> 26:05.029
and that I've got to give."

26:05.031 --> 26:08.933
Okay. So what made him
different?

26:08.935 --> 26:12.236
Look, no kid likes
a foster home.

26:12.238 --> 26:15.172
Every kid wants
to believe that someday,

26:15.174 --> 26:16.874
Mommy and Daddy are
gonna come back

26:16.876 --> 26:18.842
and everything's gonna be
better.

26:18.844 --> 26:21.579
Well, Terry never even had that.

26:21.581 --> 26:24.181
His mother dead
from that accident,

26:24.183 --> 26:26.183
and then his father.

26:26.185 --> 26:28.035
I don't know.

26:28.036 --> 26:29.886
Maybe you just never get over
something like that.

26:29.889 --> 26:31.922
What happened to his father?

26:31.924 --> 26:37.595
Oh, and this one,
this one...

26:37.597 --> 26:40.664
this was my favorite.

26:40.666 --> 26:43.067
I'd never forget it.

26:43.069 --> 26:49.340
And my daddy... hey, you
know what his name was?

26:49.342 --> 26:51.976
It was Owen.

26:54.847 --> 26:57.047
Just like you, buddy.

26:58.951 --> 27:02.920
There's nothing in
quadrant E-2.

27:02.922 --> 27:04.622
No dice in W-4.

27:10.029 --> 27:11.862
Need a better vantage point.

27:18.838 --> 27:21.205
Thank you.

27:21.207 --> 27:23.040
ED:
Sierra One in position.

27:23.042 --> 27:25.409
No sign. Hold on. Hold on.

27:25.411 --> 27:27.745
At the carousel.

27:27.747 --> 27:29.747
Bravo Team,
that's closest to you.

27:29.749 --> 27:31.415
There it is.
Okay.

27:31.417 --> 27:34.718
ED:
Wordy, Donna, stealth approach.

27:34.720 --> 27:37.021
Alpha Team, what's your 20?

27:37.023 --> 27:39.123
Alpha Team's on the move,
but we're far!

27:43.262 --> 27:44.962
I didn't cry.
(baby crying)

27:44.964 --> 27:46.230
Well, you were
four, Terry.

27:46.232 --> 27:48.165
He's just a baby.

27:48.167 --> 27:50.100
Give him to me.

27:50.102 --> 27:53.070
(baby crying)

27:55.041 --> 27:57.274
I thought we were gonna go
downtown together.

27:57.276 --> 27:59.109
Yeah, we will.

27:59.111 --> 28:01.345
Then what are they doing here?

28:05.117 --> 28:06.950
Terry, I'm sorry.

28:06.952 --> 28:09.720
When I go to jail,

28:09.722 --> 28:14.692
you'll probably never see me
again, right?

28:14.694 --> 28:18.162
You'll just give me up.

28:20.800 --> 28:24.435
(sobbing):
We were supposed to be together!

28:24.437 --> 28:27.071
Supposed to?

28:27.073 --> 28:30.174
Terry, we did all
of this together!

28:31.777 --> 28:33.744
He's escalating.
And he's got the baby.

28:35.247 --> 28:37.781
You know, maybe it doesn't
matter how much we want it.

28:37.783 --> 28:39.717
We have to think about what
he needs, okay?

28:39.719 --> 28:40.718
Give him to me!

28:40.720 --> 28:41.418
No!

28:41.420 --> 28:42.886
No?

28:42.888 --> 28:45.155
It's too late!

28:47.026 --> 28:48.325
Terry...

28:48.327 --> 28:49.893
give him to me!

28:49.895 --> 28:50.961
No!

28:55.968 --> 28:57.735
Terry!

29:10.149 --> 29:11.281
He's seen us.

29:11.283 --> 29:12.916
Cover's blown.
We're in pursuit.

29:17.356 --> 29:19.323
Wordy, on the girl.
Donna, follow the male.

29:19.325 --> 29:21.191
Spike and Lew,
get to the carousel.

29:24.163 --> 29:25.896
I got him.
You got him?

29:25.898 --> 29:27.297
Splitting up.

29:27.299 --> 29:29.133
Terry!

29:30.369 --> 29:32.136
Stay right there!
Stay right there!
Stay right there!

29:32.138 --> 29:33.403
I gotta go!
I gotta go! I gotta go!

29:33.405 --> 29:35.172
Okay, I know, I know,
I know, I know.

29:35.174 --> 29:37.041
I can't let him go!

29:37.042 --> 29:38.909
I need you to calm down.
Okay? I need... Listen. I know.

29:38.911 --> 29:41.145
Easy, easy.
Wordy, Wordy, go with Donna.
Go with Donna. I got her.

29:41.147 --> 29:42.946
I got her.
I don't know what
he's gonna do!

29:46.786 --> 29:48.385
(panting)

29:50.823 --> 29:52.389
(baby fussing)

29:54.894 --> 29:57.861
ED:
Donna, wait on my go.

29:57.863 --> 29:59.897
Boss, he's headed for the stairs
and he's got the baby.

30:01.100 --> 30:02.132
Eddie, stop him.

30:02.134 --> 30:03.433
He's too far to Tase.

30:03.435 --> 30:04.268
Then go lethal.

30:04.270 --> 30:05.302
Rubber bullets?

30:05.304 --> 30:06.854
That might not do it, Ed.

30:06.855 --> 30:08.405
If he makes it up there,
that baby could die!

30:08.407 --> 30:09.940
Copy that.

30:09.942 --> 30:11.341
I don't have a clear shot.

30:11.343 --> 30:13.944
Sabine, do you have the
solution?

30:13.946 --> 30:17.881
Sabine, you have Scorpio,
take the shot.

30:18.517 --> 30:21.318
Negative, no solution.

30:26.458 --> 30:28.358
The baby's in jeopardy.
He's going up the coaster,

30:28.360 --> 30:30.327
but he can't go anyplace
once he's at the top.

30:30.329 --> 30:33.263
Yes, he can. He can go
the way his father went, Ed.

30:33.265 --> 30:35.332
He can jump.

30:37.536 --> 30:40.337
Donna, Wordy, wait on my lead.

30:40.339 --> 30:41.538
DONNA & WORDY:
Copy.

30:51.383 --> 30:54.384
Hey, Terry, hey, wait up, buddy.

30:54.386 --> 30:57.354
It's me, Greg Parker,
I want to help you.

31:02.895 --> 31:04.962
I have to get up there!
I have to get up there!

31:04.964 --> 31:06.430
Listen, there's
nothing you can do

31:06.431 --> 31:07.897
up there but put
yourself in danger.
Please...

31:07.900 --> 31:09.233
He has my baby!

31:09.235 --> 31:10.868
Terry!

31:10.870 --> 31:12.469
Hey. It's me, Greg.

31:12.471 --> 31:14.972
Come on.

31:14.974 --> 31:17.574
Hold up a second.

31:17.576 --> 31:21.311
Hey. I just want to
talk to you.

31:21.313 --> 31:22.880
It's okay.

31:22.882 --> 31:23.914
It's all right.

31:23.916 --> 31:26.083
You get her out of here.

31:26.085 --> 31:28.552
I made her do this.
She shouldn't have to see this.

31:28.554 --> 31:30.354
What's "this"?
What do you mean?

31:32.024 --> 31:34.024
Hey, can I talk to you
for a second?

31:34.026 --> 31:35.926
Just man to man.
What do you say?

31:35.928 --> 31:39.029
Know what I see?

31:39.031 --> 31:41.331
I see a guy who's trying
to do the right thing,

31:41.333 --> 31:43.600
but suddenly finds himself
in the wrong place.

31:43.602 --> 31:45.502
Is-Is that close?

31:47.506 --> 31:49.006
I'll bet you...

31:49.008 --> 31:50.641
you don't even want
to be up here.

31:50.643 --> 31:53.677
In fact, I bet
you can't imagine

31:53.679 --> 31:55.212
why you're even up here.

31:55.214 --> 31:56.580
What, do you think I'm stupid?

31:56.582 --> 31:58.348
No.

31:58.350 --> 32:01.418
No, I think you got feelings.

32:01.420 --> 32:04.221
I think you got big,
gigantic feelings,

32:04.223 --> 32:06.690
the kind that just come out of
your stomach and make you feel

32:06.692 --> 32:09.526
like, "What do you
do?" sometimes.

32:09.528 --> 32:11.595
And you've never had anybody
in your life

32:11.597 --> 32:13.430
to teach you
about those feelings,

32:13.432 --> 32:15.532
to help you with those feelings,
and that's not fair.

32:15.534 --> 32:18.435
Oh. Oh, I have lots of people.

32:18.437 --> 32:20.203
Loads of families.

32:20.205 --> 32:21.505
A different one every year.

32:21.507 --> 32:23.273
Sure.

32:23.275 --> 32:25.208
But they've never been
your real family.

32:25.210 --> 32:26.443
Right?

32:28.047 --> 32:29.680
What's going on? Is he...?

32:29.682 --> 32:32.215
SPIKE:
It's under control.

32:32.217 --> 32:34.685
My ma died when I was just four.

32:34.687 --> 32:36.286
I know.

32:36.288 --> 32:38.555
Yeah? You know what happened
to my old man?

32:38.557 --> 32:41.391
You know that, too?

32:41.393 --> 32:42.626
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

32:42.628 --> 32:45.562
That's...
That's why I want to help you.

32:46.532 --> 32:48.665
Five years old.

32:48.667 --> 32:52.502
And Ma's dead not a year.

32:52.504 --> 32:55.405
And we go up to the top
of our building.

32:55.407 --> 32:57.674
Hey, just stay with me, buddy.
Just stay with me.

32:57.676 --> 32:59.409
And I remember...

33:00.379 --> 33:02.646
...he puts me down
by the door...

33:04.316 --> 33:06.316
...and he gives me
a piece of paper.

33:06.318 --> 33:08.618
I can't read.

33:08.620 --> 33:10.520
I don't know what's on it.

33:10.522 --> 33:13.557
And I'm just standing there,

33:13.559 --> 33:16.526
looking up at my dad...

33:17.563 --> 33:19.529
...as he walks to the edge.

33:19.531 --> 33:22.666
Terry, you're not your father.

33:22.668 --> 33:25.535
You're your own person.

33:25.537 --> 33:28.105
So, what's wrong with me?

33:28.107 --> 33:29.740
Nothing.

33:29.742 --> 33:32.509
What is wrong with me?!

33:32.511 --> 33:34.678
Nothing.

33:34.680 --> 33:36.480
Nothing's wrong.

33:38.751 --> 33:40.684
Still have the solution,
but no way to take him out

33:40.686 --> 33:42.219
without the baby
going over, too.

33:42.221 --> 33:43.687
Copy that.

33:46.025 --> 33:48.759
All I want
is what everybody gets.

33:48.761 --> 33:51.194
What do you want?
You tell me.

33:51.196 --> 33:54.598
I want my family.

33:54.600 --> 33:58.802
I want to come home and they're
there every day, no matter what.

33:58.804 --> 34:03.440
I want my little boy
to look at me...

34:03.442 --> 34:06.443
and say, "Daddy, don't leave."

34:06.445 --> 34:08.378
And I'd say, "I would never."

34:08.380 --> 34:09.746
You've got it.

34:09.748 --> 34:11.681
You've got it.
You've already got it.

34:11.683 --> 34:12.749
You've got...
You've got Jessie.

34:12.751 --> 34:14.317
She loves you.

34:14.319 --> 34:16.370
She loves you.

34:16.371 --> 34:18.422
She wants you to come back down
safe, you and Owen.

34:20.626 --> 34:21.758
Oh, my God.
He's bleeding.

34:21.760 --> 34:23.627
No, no, no, Terry.
What am I doing?

34:23.629 --> 34:24.828
It's okay. It's
just your hand.

34:24.830 --> 34:26.563
It's okay.
It's okay.

34:26.565 --> 34:27.764
It's okay.

34:29.334 --> 34:31.234
Look at what I'm going
to do every time.

34:31.236 --> 34:32.769
Won't I?
No, no.

34:32.771 --> 34:35.539
It doesn't have to go that way.
It doesn't have to go that way.

34:35.541 --> 34:36.706
Come on. Come on.

34:36.708 --> 34:38.775
It's going to be okay.

34:40.446 --> 34:45.282
No. You were the one
who told Jessie he was hungry.

34:45.284 --> 34:46.550
That's right.

34:46.552 --> 34:48.752
Probably still is hungry.

34:48.754 --> 34:50.620
Why don't we go
feed him together? Come on.

34:50.622 --> 34:52.722
We'll go feed him
together, okay?

34:52.724 --> 34:55.258
Come on.

34:55.260 --> 34:56.526
Yeah.

34:56.528 --> 34:57.694
Come on. That's it.

34:57.696 --> 34:59.629
That's it.

35:01.333 --> 35:04.134
Okay, thank you.

35:05.637 --> 35:08.105
Team, be ready.

35:08.107 --> 35:10.640
You take care of him for me.

35:10.642 --> 35:12.609
You bet.

35:12.611 --> 35:13.844
Come here.

35:13.846 --> 35:15.579
Here we go.

35:15.581 --> 35:17.647
(baby crying)
Here we go.

35:17.649 --> 35:19.783
Careful.
That's it.
I got him.

35:19.785 --> 35:21.118
I got him.
I'm sorry.

35:21.119 --> 35:22.452
Let go of him, Terry.
I'm sorry.

35:22.454 --> 35:24.554
No, you're not going anywhere.
You're not going anywhere.

35:24.556 --> 35:26.289
Don't go, Terry.
Don't go, Terry.

35:26.291 --> 35:27.791
Don't go.
Terry, don't go.

35:27.793 --> 35:30.360
Don't go, my man.
Don't go, my man.

35:33.365 --> 35:34.731
Don't. Don't.

35:37.769 --> 35:39.136
Terry!

35:39.138 --> 35:40.770
Terry!

35:42.875 --> 35:44.174
(gasping)

35:47.813 --> 35:48.845
No, no!

35:48.847 --> 35:51.815
(sobbing)

35:51.817 --> 35:53.350
Jessie!

35:53.352 --> 35:55.685
No, don't. No! Terry!

35:55.687 --> 35:58.622
I'm sorry!

35:59.591 --> 36:01.525
Terry!

36:22.681 --> 36:24.548
We'll debrief.
We'll debrief.
All right.

36:24.550 --> 36:25.715
Later, all right?
All right.

36:25.717 --> 36:26.883
Okay.
Okay.

36:26.885 --> 36:28.485
Good night.

36:30.455 --> 36:32.222
Jessie?

36:32.224 --> 36:33.523
There's a police officer
over there.

36:33.525 --> 36:35.792
He's ready to take a statement.

36:39.531 --> 36:41.198
Did he say anything
before he...

36:41.200 --> 36:42.966
Yeah.

36:44.603 --> 36:46.903
He said to "take care
of him for me."

36:46.905 --> 36:51.741
His dad wrote that.

36:51.743 --> 36:54.711
In a note.

36:57.449 --> 36:59.683
I have to take Owen now, Jessie.

37:02.588 --> 37:04.254
(sniffles)

37:07.659 --> 37:09.526
His name is Liam.

"The subject's family history
made suicide likely,

37:45.631 --> 37:48.398

38:15.527 --> 38:17.594
Hey. Tomorrow we're going
to do this debrief again,

38:17.596 --> 38:19.863
and you are going to tell the
boss what really happened.

38:19.865 --> 38:23.566
'Cause, Donna, the only thing
that is more dangerous

38:23.568 --> 38:25.669
than a cop who
shoots too fast

38:25.671 --> 38:28.638
is a cop who can't
shoot when they need to.

38:28.640 --> 38:30.740
Now, you had the
shot and I saw it.

38:30.742 --> 38:31.975
You saw it?
Yeah.

38:31.977 --> 38:34.244
Well, where were you, then?

38:34.245 --> 38:36.512
Because where I was, I was
pointing a gun at a scared kid

38:36.515 --> 38:39.382
with a baby in his hands.

38:39.384 --> 38:40.550
We got an order.

38:40.552 --> 38:42.385
You questioned the order.

38:42.387 --> 38:45.622
Yeah, I did. But the boss had
information we didn't have.

38:45.624 --> 38:47.657
I asked a question,
and then I did my job,

38:47.659 --> 38:49.759
like a member of this
team is supposed to.

38:49.761 --> 38:51.761
All right?

38:51.763 --> 38:54.397
Are you a member of this team?

38:57.369 --> 38:58.668
Yes.

38:58.670 --> 39:00.103
(sighs)

39:00.105 --> 39:01.805
That's good.

39:03.442 --> 39:04.808
Does this job get any easier?

39:04.810 --> 39:07.544
No.
