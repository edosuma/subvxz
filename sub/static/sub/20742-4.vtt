Previously on The Bridge...

00:02.385 --> 00:03.695
SONYA: He watched from here.

00:03.816 --> 00:05.330
MARCO: How do you know he was watching?

00:05.331 --> 00:07.031
SONYA: He had to, to know if they'd died.

00:07.151 --> 00:09.572
WADE: There's a missing girl,
she was with the migrants.

00:09.987 --> 00:12.661
She walked to the road, we
think, and got picked up.

00:12.664 --> 00:14.129
FRYE: You got a name?

00:14.140 --> 00:16.924
WADE: No, but we have a
contact in Juàrez.

00:16.932 --> 00:18.480
Maybe you'll get further than we did.

00:18.488 --> 00:20.342
SONYA: Steven, do you have her?

00:20.373 --> 00:21.429
LINDER: No.

00:21.872 --> 00:24.628
SONYA: 'Cause the person who
does killed nine other people,

00:24.748 --> 00:27.419
and a judge and a pool girl from Juarez.

00:27.450 --> 00:29.100
MAN: I have her.

00:29.679 --> 00:32.987
I'll let her go for a price.

00:33.190 --> 00:34.708
FRYE: How much?

00:34.747 --> 00:36.053
MAN: Million dollars.

00:36.173 --> 00:38.759
CHARLOTTE: The tunnel has got to go away.

- WADE: Where?

00:53.954 --> 00:55.205
SONYA: Go online.

00:55.206 --> 00:56.629
El Paso Times.

00:57.043 --> 00:58.852
What do you think he's doing?

00:59.131 --> 01:02.306
WADE: I think he's gonna
let the desert take her.

01:03.206 --> 01:06.451
Right before our eyes.

01:25.784 --> 01:28.975
- WADE: Whose idea was this anyhow... ?
- KITTY: Good morning, Lieutenant.

01:29.820 --> 01:31.077
- WADE: Thank you.
- KITTY: You're welcome.

01:31.102 --> 01:32.542
Heller called, FBI's on the way.

01:32.567 --> 01:33.956
WADE: I figured as much.

01:34.797 --> 01:36.277
SONYA: It's all over the Internet.

01:36.340 --> 01:38.180
COOPER: It's going viral, as they say.

01:38.300 --> 01:39.894
WADE: Well, that don't sound good.

01:39.938 --> 01:41.577
MARCO: My son said to me this morning,

01:41.589 --> 01:43.485
they're calling him the Bridge Butcher.

01:43.516 --> 01:45.256
SONYA: Daniel Frye leaked it.

01:46.757 --> 01:48.896
(deep exhale)  WADE: You
got any kind of computer

01:48.897 --> 01:51.211
judo to figure out where
she's being held at?

01:51.274 --> 01:52.901
COOPER: No, video stream's been routed

01:52.914 --> 01:54.703
through a bunch of proxies.

01:57.530 --> 01:59.396
MARCO: She's got a day at best.

01:59.397 --> 02:00.415
- WADE: Cooper?
- COOPER: Yes, sir?

02:00.428 --> 02:01.585
WADE: Get out with a search team,

02:01.604 --> 02:03.450
and make sure that don't
turn into a goat rodeo.

02:03.506 --> 02:03.994
COOPER: Copy that.

02:04.001 --> 02:06.722
WADE: I want you to drag
Frye's sorry ass in here now.

CHARLOTTE: You're gonna have to fix that.

03:08.617 --> 03:09.980
Kate can't know about this.

03:11.131 --> 03:12.463
If she asks, just say we...

03:12.532 --> 03:13.715
we sold Rio.

03:13.835 --> 03:14.622
CESAR: To who?

03:14.835 --> 03:16.998
CHARLOTTE: I don't know,
Cesar. Just make something up.

03:17.443 --> 03:18.606
(Cesar speaks Spanish)

03:19.720 --> 03:20.765
CHARLOTTE: Nobody heard this happen.

03:20.765 --> 03:22.298
How is that possible?

03:23.431 --> 03:24.776
CESAR: I was sleeping.

03:24.970 --> 03:27.266
CHARLOTTE: I'm gonna have to
upgrade the whole security system.

03:27.316 --> 03:28.586
CESAR: It won't do any good.

03:28.880 --> 03:30.769
She wants that tunnel opened.

03:31.862 --> 03:33.586
CHARLOTTE: And if I don't?

03:34.196 --> 03:36.382
CESAR: It won't be a horse next time.

03:48.270 --> 03:49.452
CHARLOTTE: Okay, open it.

03:50.184 --> 03:51.498
CESAR: I'll take care of it.

03:51.618 --> 03:52.900
CHARLOTTE: How?

03:53.475 --> 03:54.952
CESAR: I'll call her.

03:55.171 --> 03:56.416
CHARLOTTE: And that's it?

03:56.667 --> 03:58.237
CESAR: For now.

03:58.700 --> 04:00.508
The less you know, the better.

04:01.247 --> 04:02.147
(sighs)

04:18.308 --> 04:20.047
CHARLOTTE: We don't smoke out here.

04:21.192 --> 04:22.631
KATE: I do.

04:24.108 --> 04:25.997
CHARLOTTE: When do you go back exactly?

04:27.199 --> 04:28.800
KATE: Changed my ticket.

04:29.157 --> 04:31.359
My lawyer thought it
was a good idea for me to

04:31.672 --> 04:33.849
stay here for the reading of the will.

04:35.038 --> 04:36.302
CHARLOTTE: Oh.

04:36.815 --> 04:38.460
Okay.

04:39.355 --> 04:41.132
KATE: It's only fair, you know?

04:43.503 --> 04:44.648
My mother, um,

04:44.768 --> 04:46.844
- Jane was her name...
- CHARLOTTE: I remember her name.

04:48.262 --> 04:50.154
KATE: This was her garden.

04:50.274 --> 04:52.043
She liked to sit out here,

04:52.525 --> 04:54.264
watch the hummingbirds.

04:54.384 --> 04:55.897
CHARLOTTE: Your father wanted a pool.

04:56.017 --> 04:57.996
KATE: Oh, yeah. I remember.

04:58.116 --> 05:00.573
That was about the same time
my mom was getting chemo.

05:00.924 --> 05:02.400
Fun times.

05:02.520 --> 05:05.147
CHARLOTTE: Your father loved you very much.

05:07.518 --> 05:08.689
(Kate chuckles softly)

05:08.951 --> 05:10.253
KATE: My father

05:10.684 --> 05:12.906
wasn't capable of love.

05:13.896 --> 05:15.684
You know that, don't you?

05:15.872 --> 05:18.694
You were just the shiny new thing to him.

05:18.988 --> 05:21.071
Just like that stupid horse.

05:26.433 --> 05:28.460
Let the Mexican pick them up.

05:29.929 --> 05:31.488
CHARLOTTE: Her name is Tina.

05:31.676 --> 05:33.703
And she has other work to do.

05:33.746 --> 05:36.076
KATE: That's right. Tina...

05:37.175 --> 05:38.752
found this.

05:38.964 --> 05:40.829
In the guest bedroom.

05:54.869 --> 05:56.509
ADRIANA: I haven't heard
from him this morning.

05:56.571 --> 05:57.785
MARCO: He's not answering his phone,

05:57.785 --> 05:58.680
he's not in his apartment...

05:58.705 --> 06:00.181
ADRIANA: Yeah, well, that's Frye.

06:00.301 --> 06:02.545
SONYA: His editor doesn't
know where he is, either.

06:02.665 --> 06:04.422
ADRIANA: Is this about the video?

06:04.785 --> 06:06.255
SONYA: Did you know he had it?

06:06.375 --> 06:07.957
ADRIANA: Yes. It's news.

06:07.988 --> 06:10.128
MARCO: We've been over that already, Sonya.

06:10.679 --> 06:13.394
ADRIANA: Can I ask you some
questions about the case?

06:13.663 --> 06:15.027
SONYA: Media requests have to be filed

06:15.031 --> 06:16.739
with our public relations officer.

06:16.961 --> 06:18.557
ADRIANA: Ah, well, I was
just hoping for something

06:18.569 --> 06:20.603
more off the record...

07:10.861 --> 07:14.073
LINDER: That's a bad
place to rest, partner.

- MANDY: Yeah?

09:16.296 --> 09:18.065
SONYA: We're looking for Daniel Frye.

09:18.397 --> 09:19.917
MANDY: Uh, he's here.

09:20.037 --> 09:21.488
He drank all my vodka

09:21.507 --> 09:22.664
and won't stop talking

09:22.677 --> 09:24.547
and he can't even get it up.

09:27.494 --> 09:29.083
SONYA: Where are your pants?

09:29.203 --> 09:31.229
MANDY: Bastard said I look fat in them.

09:31.404 --> 09:33.218
MARCO: Nope, you look fine.

09:33.719 --> 09:35.958
MANDY: Make him leave, now.

09:41.513 --> 09:42.339
SONYA: Hey.

09:42.383 --> 09:43.628
MARCO: Hey, get up.

09:43.678 --> 09:45.367
Get up, I said.

09:56.726 --> 09:58.626
Yes, yes, come on, get up.

09:58.746 --> 10:00.028
Let's do it.

10:00.454 --> 10:02.625
FRYE: Hold on. Hold on a second. (mumbles)

10:06.862 --> 10:08.431

12:15.157 --> 12:16.670
We're dealing with a highly intelligent

12:16.708 --> 12:18.597
and technically adept individual.

12:18.810 --> 12:20.174
How did it get out?

12:20.775 --> 12:22.495

12:22.551 --> 12:23.790
MARCO: We got him in custody.

12:23.840 --> 12:25.404
- HELLER: And he has his phone?

Soon as he dries out.

- SONYA: Nothing since the video.
- HELLER: Good.

12:32.525 --> 12:34.833
Agent Gedman here will take
point on the negotiations.

12:34.858 --> 12:36.222
GEDMAN: Our suspect has made a demand

12:36.229 --> 12:37.780
that is in keeping with his agenda.

12:37.843 --> 12:39.257
MARCO: What agenda is that?

12:39.260 --> 12:41.206
This girl didn't do anything wrong.

12:41.453 --> 12:43.968
She was just trying to make
a better life for herself.

12:44.156 --> 12:46.790
GEDMAN: The killer wishes to
inflame cultural sensitivities...

12:46.796 --> 12:48.298
the judge, the immigrants,

12:48.317 --> 12:49.718
money from prominent businessmen

12:49.718 --> 12:51.001
who profit from the border.

12:51.045 --> 12:54.079
SONYA: How does Cristina
Fuentes fit into that agenda?

12:55.486 --> 12:56.619
GEDMAN: She was a prostitute.

12:56.863 --> 12:58.239
Might've been a practice kill.

12:58.258 --> 12:59.753
We need to focus on his demands.

12:59.784 --> 13:00.804
SONYA: This is not about money.

13:00.810 --> 13:02.093
He's not a kidnapper.

13:02.099 --> 13:03.688
He's already killed 11 people.

13:03.771 --> 13:04.758
GEDMAN: And your point, Detective?

13:04.771 --> 13:05.472
SONYA: Ransom demands

13:05.478 --> 13:08.358
are an atypical methodology
for a serial killer.

13:08.478 --> 13:10.477
MARCO: He wants us to watch her die.

13:10.597 --> 13:12.479
GEDMAN: He's abducted a
woman; he's demanding money.

13:12.492 --> 13:15.095
We will proceed towards a positive outcome.

13:15.151 --> 13:16.502
MARCO: Do you have the money for the drop?

13:16.622 --> 13:17.672
HELLER: We're waiting on the Reserve.

13:17.710 --> 13:19.449
GEDMAN: If and when the
killer contacts the reporter,

13:19.461 --> 13:20.531
we should be ready with the drop.

13:20.756 --> 13:22.446
MARCO: The victim is a Mexican citizen...

13:22.471 --> 13:24.010
- I want to be a part of it.
- GEDMAN: Nope.

13:24.035 --> 13:26.143
This is a U.S. operation, Detective.

13:26.263 --> 13:29.891
MARCO: So we just sit back
and watch you handle it?

13:33.826 --> 13:35.640
GEDMAN: I've negotiated over a hundred

13:35.665 --> 13:37.905
of these hostage situations, okay?

13:38.524 --> 13:39.951
MARCO: Impressive.

15:04.485 --> 15:07.253

- CESAR: Nothing.

15:07.879 --> 15:09.458

- CESAR: Yes.

15:09.498 --> 15:10.804
CHARLOTTE: What did she say?

15:11.085 --> 15:14.050
CESAR: Nothing. It's just business.

15:14.988 --> 15:17.397
Maybe you should go do something.

15:17.647 --> 15:18.610
CHARLOTTE: Do something?

15:18.633 --> 15:20.182
What... what the hell am I supposed to do,

15:20.205 --> 15:21.597
Cesar? Go shopping?

15:21.717 --> 15:23.365
This is illegal.

15:23.592 --> 15:24.390
CESAR: Yes.

15:24.640 --> 15:26.478
Yes, it is.

15:28.652 --> 15:30.592

15:34.189 --> 15:36.895
MARCO: Did he give you a
way to get in touch with him

15:36.927 --> 15:38.733
when the ransom has been gathered?

15:38.772 --> 15:41.337
FRYE: No. He just sort of
calls when he feels like it.

15:41.457 --> 15:44.317
- GEDMAN: Anything else you can tell us?
- (Frye clears throat)

15:44.662 --> 15:46.380
FRYE: He's what I would call a doer...

15:46.412 --> 15:48.015
he doesn't talk so much.

15:48.054 --> 15:49.994
I'm guessing he's got (chuckles)

15:50.114 --> 15:53.724
some mommy issues or maybe some
Mexican girl broke his heart.

15:53.844 --> 15:55.680
It's either that or he gets a big

15:55.695 --> 15:59.152
fat chubby killing people
and messing with cops.

15:59.272 --> 16:02.445
MARCO: That girl is dying out there.

16:03.079 --> 16:04.166
FRYE: Not for nothing,

16:04.181 --> 16:05.839
but this guy's trying to make a point.

16:05.886 --> 16:08.858
Nobody really gives a shit
if some brown girl dies.

16:08.858 --> 16:11.948
As long as it stays south
of the border, nobody cares.

16:11.956 --> 16:13.497
HELLER: That's not true.

16:13.520 --> 16:15.304
FRYE: Oh, yeah? Did you get the money yet?

16:16.046 --> 16:19.878
Hmm? 'Cause I'm betting if
it was a pretty little coed

16:19.909 --> 16:22.662
with blonde hair and perfect teeth

16:22.693 --> 16:26.048
and big tits, the money would
come raining in by now, bro.

16:26.064 --> 16:27.166
GEDMAN: When this is all over,

16:27.385 --> 16:30.152
I'm gonna run you through
the system, see what pops.

16:30.177 --> 16:32.477
FRYE: I love it when you
talk dirty. Where's the money?

16:34.711 --> 16:36.694
MARCO: Try not to be an asshole.

16:45.675 --> 16:47.296
SONYA: She's getting weaker.

16:50.249 --> 16:51.869
MARCO: She doesn't have long.

16:52.946 --> 16:54.716
SONYA: Three or four hours.

16:55.185 --> 16:56.849
MARCO: Why are you watching?

16:58.507 --> 17:01.723
SONYA: There's got to be a
way to figure out where she is.

17:02.975 --> 17:05.621
She keeps moving her eyes.

17:06.710 --> 17:08.656
It's like she's looking at something.

17:09.444 --> 17:10.977
MARCO: If you say so.

17:11.765 --> 17:13.355
You should take a break.

17:13.723 --> 17:15.526
Just go for a walk.

17:17.290 --> 17:19.073
SONYA: Why would I go for a walk?

17:19.098 --> 17:20.455
MARCO: Sometimes you need to...

17:20.775 --> 17:23.421
get away from a problem to figure it out.

17:23.471 --> 17:26.105
SONYA: Yeah, well, you take
a walk; I'm going to find her.

17:26.818 --> 17:28.658
COOPER: Frye just got the call.

17:31.266 --> 17:33.785
- K: Are you with the police, Daniel?
- FRYE: Yes.

17:34.251 --> 17:35.558
K: The feds?

17:35.740 --> 17:37.067
FRYE: Them, too.

17:37.117 --> 17:39.600
K: Ugh, you can always
count on them to insert

17:39.600 --> 17:41.233
themselves where they're not wanted.

17:41.353 --> 17:43.712
FRYE: They're good at insertion.

17:43.743 --> 17:44.581
Sorry.

17:44.701 --> 17:45.983
K: Names?

17:48.179 --> 17:49.261
HELLER (mouths): Tell him.

17:49.305 --> 17:50.869
FRYE: Heller and Gedman.

17:50.919 --> 17:52.702
K: Who'll be making the drop?

17:52.708 --> 17:54.681
- HELLER (mouths): Gedman.
- FRYE: Gedman.

17:54.801 --> 17:56.596
K: Look forward to meeting him.

17:56.840 --> 17:58.404
Do you have the money?

17:58.972 --> 18:00.050
FRYE: Yes.

18:00.170 --> 18:01.677
K: That was fast.

18:02.202 --> 18:04.636
FRYE: Uh... you've got
everyone's attention.

18:04.642 --> 18:06.263
You made your point, trust me.

18:06.500 --> 18:07.864
K: I doubt that.

18:07.927 --> 18:09.585
Instructions to follow.

18:10.072 --> 18:11.361
(phone beeps)

18:11.818 --> 18:13.589
WADE: We need that money now.

18:13.608 --> 18:14.465
HELLER: It's coming.

18:14.585 --> 18:16.238
Needs to go through the proper channels.

18:16.239 --> 18:17.861
FRYE: So, why did he
want to know your names?

18:17.875 --> 18:19.821
HELLER: He wants a personal connection.

18:19.921 --> 18:22.292
Builds trust, show we can keep our word.

18:22.329 --> 18:23.718
Gedman.

18:25.801 --> 18:29.042
FRYE: Well, that was...
that was great, huh?

18:29.055 --> 18:30.237
I guess my work here is done.

18:30.250 --> 18:31.526
I'm gonna go get some tacos.

18:31.532 --> 18:33.647
WADE: You're not going anywhere, son.

18:37.874 --> 18:40.039
MARCO: This guy Gedman looks nervous.

18:40.239 --> 18:42.210
You sure he's done this
kind of thing before?

18:42.239 --> 18:43.461
WADE: Got a case of the yips?

18:43.581 --> 18:44.738
(phone ringing) This isn't your average

18:44.750 --> 18:45.607
hostage-taker.

18:45.620 --> 18:47.422
He could be walking into an ambush.

18:47.542 --> 18:48.905
MARCO: Excuse me.

18:49.136 --> 18:50.487
Marco Ruiz.

18:51.882 --> 18:53.252
Okay.

18:55.079 --> 18:57.100
I'm sorry. I... I'll be right back.

18:57.138 --> 18:58.433
(door opens)

18:58.658 --> 19:00.660
SONYA: That's his wife.
She calls all the time.

19:00.780 --> 19:02.363
WADE: Well, he's got a strong marriage.

19:02.382 --> 19:03.858
You want that in a partner.

19:13.072 --> 19:15.783
(Spanish ballad playing)

19:47.811 --> 19:49.975
(Marco sputters)

21:50.502 --> 21:51.947
MARCO: Got the money.

21:58.431 --> 22:00.195
SONYA: Where did you find it?

22:00.471 --> 22:02.511
MARCO: A donor who wishes
to remain anonymous.

22:02.555 --> 22:04.475
HELLER: We have to know
where you got it, Detective.

22:04.938 --> 22:06.778
MARCO: A prominent Mexican citizen.

22:06.898 --> 22:08.824
GEDMAN: Yeah, we're gonna need a
little more information than that.

22:08.861 --> 22:10.369
MARCO: El Rey Storage.

22:10.388 --> 22:12.491
The man who owns it wants to help.

22:12.611 --> 22:13.848
HELLER: I'd rather draw from the reserve.

22:13.886 --> 22:16.113
Fewer potential problems should
something happen with the money.

22:16.233 --> 22:18.409
SONYA: We've been waiting on
that reserve money all day.

22:18.446 --> 22:20.273
WADE: Search has turned up squat.

22:20.336 --> 22:22.533
This money is your only shot.

22:22.846 --> 22:23.803
(Marco sighs)

22:26.205 --> 22:27.263
HELLER: All right.

22:27.300 --> 22:29.268
Have a tracker put in this.

22:29.388 --> 22:30.268
Get wired up.

22:30.298 --> 22:31.399
If we have a shot at nabbing this guy,

22:31.411 --> 22:32.175
I don't want to miss it.

22:32.206 --> 22:33.295
MARCO: I'm gonna go on the drop.

22:33.363 --> 22:34.922
HELLER: You're not
authorized to carry a weapon.

22:34.947 --> 22:37.687
MARCO: I brought the money,
the girl's Mexican, I'm going!

23:02.343 --> 23:03.832
LINDER: We've arrived.

23:07.448 --> 23:08.862
LINDER: He's expecting us.

23:09.526 --> 23:11.291
You prepared for this?

23:12.811 --> 23:14.300
Need you to answer me.

23:16.784 --> 23:17.898
EVA: Yes.

23:29.835 --> 23:31.574
(chickens clucking)

23:42.257 --> 23:44.502
- LINDER: Hello, Bob.
- BOB: Brother Steven.

23:44.622 --> 23:45.861
LINDER: I'm not your brother.

23:45.892 --> 23:48.489
BOB: Ah, we're all brothers
in the eyes of the Lord.

23:49.521 --> 23:51.917
LINDER: I don't share your views, Bob.

23:52.037 --> 23:53.231
You know, there's nothing.

23:53.351 --> 23:55.070
We're alone in the world.

23:55.883 --> 23:57.735
I've seen the void.

23:58.688 --> 24:00.401
BOB: I'll hold you in my prayers.

24:00.521 --> 24:03.250
LINDER: Well, yeah. If that
makes you feel better, Bob.

24:04.351 --> 24:06.334
BOB: Where is she?

24:15.138 --> 24:16.933
LINDER: Eva, you can come out.

24:18.766 --> 24:21.387
Eva, this is Bob. Bob, this is Eva.

24:22.489 --> 24:25.148
- BOB: Welcome to the ranch, Eva.
- EVA: Hello.

24:26.268 --> 24:28.890
LINDER: Eva here wishes to change her life.

24:28.927 --> 24:31.223
BOB: Well, you've come to the right place.

24:31.593 --> 24:35.052
EVA: You said that I will
have a job and place to live.

24:35.653 --> 24:36.954
LINDER: That's true.

24:37.242 --> 24:38.262
BOB: You're at the ranch.

24:38.281 --> 24:39.914
Put your past behind you.

24:40.577 --> 24:43.255
Find your grace, walk the path.

24:44.106 --> 24:45.663
- EVA: Path?
- BOB: Mm-hmm.

24:58.408 --> 25:00.479
LINDER: Well, I need a minute here, Bob.

25:01.217 --> 25:02.875
BOB: Course.

25:06.739 --> 25:08.604
LINDER: This is a safe place.

25:09.686 --> 25:11.544
Hector can't find you here.

25:12.896 --> 25:15.150
That's what he does. He hunts people.

25:16.652 --> 25:18.360
He'll find me.

25:20.574 --> 25:23.415
LINDER: Well, Bob here is
like the right hand of God.

25:25.091 --> 25:28.426
He'll protect you from people
who would seek to do you harm.

25:35.685 --> 25:37.624
EVA: How long do I have to stay?

25:39.488 --> 25:40.978
LINDER: Well, I don't know,

25:42.179 --> 25:43.950
but you can't go back. He'll kill you.

25:43.975 --> 25:45.270
EVA: I know.

25:50.515 --> 25:52.298
EVA: What do I owe you?

25:55.890 --> 25:57.829
(Linder exhales slowly)

26:03.256 --> 26:04.251
LINDER: A kiss.

26:07.188 --> 26:08.349
EVA: That's it?

26:11.226 --> 26:13.041
LINDER: Yes, I would like that.

26:22.684 --> 26:24.505
(Linder sighs)

26:29.034 --> 26:30.992
LINDER: I will remember that.

26:32.306 --> 26:33.801
Take care, Eva.

26:42.895 --> 26:44.277
Come on.

26:50.635 --> 26:52.874
HELLER: It's this circular area here.

26:54.714 --> 26:56.441
We got a spot for the drop.

26:56.459 --> 26:57.892
A Ray's Roadhouse.

26:57.917 --> 26:59.563
WADE: That's a difficult spot for a drop.

26:59.567 --> 27:00.818
You're gonna want to send somebody in

27:00.821 --> 27:02.127
- to check it out first.
- GEDMAN: Too risky.

27:02.139 --> 27:03.009
We'll keep a mile cushion.

27:03.106 --> 27:04.201
We can't afford to spook him.

27:04.285 --> 27:05.993
The important thing is, is we make the drop

27:06.013 --> 27:07.627
and get a visual on the suspect.

27:07.647 --> 27:09.773
- MARCO: If he shows up.
- WADE: Exactly.

27:10.129 --> 27:11.461
GEDMAN: He'll show up.

27:12.994 --> 27:15.834
WADE: Yeah. What is it, Sonya?

27:17.961 --> 27:20.464
SONYA (whispers): I know where she is.

27:22.341 --> 27:23.717
WADE: Um, yeah...

27:24.055 --> 27:25.976
uh, don't wait for me, I'll catch up.

27:30.562 --> 27:32.176
SONYA: He made a mistake.

27:32.545 --> 27:34.165
See that shadow?

27:36.498 --> 27:38.857
WADE: Listen... listen, will
you just tell me what it is?

27:38.901 --> 27:41.078
SONYA: It's a pump jack. For oil.

27:42.204 --> 27:44.302
WADE: Son of a bitch. Come on.

27:44.422 --> 27:47.021
- There aren't many of them around here.
- SONYA: I know.

27:47.341 --> 27:50.137
- WADE: Did you tell Cooper and the search team?
- SONYA: Yup.

27:50.381 --> 27:52.390
WADE: I know where a few of them are at.

27:57.769 --> 27:58.620
KITTY: Oh.

27:58.740 --> 28:00.791
Can't get enough of us, Mrs. Millwright?

28:01.129 --> 28:03.206
CHARLOTTE: I'm looking for Marco Ruiz.

28:03.326 --> 28:05.702
KITTY: Well, he's in a meeting.
Something I can help you with?

28:07.642 --> 28:09.926
CHARLOTTE: I... I have
his wallet. (chuckles)

28:11.377 --> 28:14.594
KITTY: All right, well, I'll
just make sure he gets it back.

28:16.122 --> 28:18.447
CHARLOTTE: Do you know how
long he'll be in his meeting?

28:18.472 --> 28:20.118
KITTY: You seen the news, hon?

28:21.556 --> 28:24.072
- CHARLOTTE: Oh, that girl in the desert?
- KITTY: Yup.

28:25.648 --> 28:28.620
But you can leave a message
if it's important, you know.

28:33.887 --> 28:36.008
CHARLOTTE: No. It's okay.

28:53.403 --> 28:55.061
MARCO: Get it back later.

28:55.656 --> 28:57.046
(Frye scoffs)

28:58.434 --> 29:00.468
FRYE: You know this
guy's not about the money.

29:02.313 --> 29:04.497
MARCO: My partner thinks the same thing.

29:04.617 --> 29:07.131
FRYE: What is up with her?

29:07.769 --> 29:09.133
MARCO: Nothing.

29:10.429 --> 29:12.800
FRYE: She's a little
short bus, don't you think?

29:12.920 --> 29:15.025
MARCO: No, I don't. She's fine.

29:16.739 --> 29:19.567
FRYE: This guy poisons,
what, nine Mexicans...

29:20.417 --> 29:21.869
what's one more?

29:22.826 --> 29:24.471
MARCO: I don't think like that.

29:24.922 --> 29:26.229
FRYE: Really? I thought
you guys were supposed

29:26.229 --> 29:28.044
to identify with the killer.

29:28.164 --> 29:29.402
MARCO: Nope.

29:32.261 --> 29:36.196
FRYE: So, I guess nine bodies
in Juarez is a slow day.

29:38.248 --> 29:39.737
- MARCO: It's getting better.
- FRYE: I don't know.

29:39.768 --> 29:42.508
I saw a guy get his brains
blown all over the pavement.

29:42.520 --> 29:43.665
MARCO: Oh,

29:43.915 --> 29:45.917
that's probably a cartel thing.

29:46.037 --> 29:48.158
FRYE: Seemed like a random thing to me.

29:50.641 --> 29:51.987
So, does your family

29:52.368 --> 29:54.395
- live down there?
- MARCO: Yes.

29:54.871 --> 29:56.792
FRYE: Bet your wife likes that, huh?

29:56.848 --> 29:59.357
MARCO: You don't know me that
well to talk about my family.

30:01.897 --> 30:03.043
FRYE: Sorry.

30:03.324 --> 30:05.051
MARCO: Just sit there.

30:05.120 --> 30:06.165
Be quiet.

30:07.667 --> 30:09.969
GEDMAN: El Rey Storage...
that's where you got the money?

30:10.570 --> 30:11.658
MARCO: Yes.

30:11.871 --> 30:14.386
GEDMAN: When this is over, there
will be questions about that.

30:15.187 --> 30:17.458
MARCO: Let's just save this girl.

30:18.490 --> 30:19.949
GEDMAN: That's the plan.

30:22.658 --> 30:23.609
WADE: Yep.

30:24.216 --> 30:25.761
Search team's scouring the hills

30:25.798 --> 30:28.827
for every oil pump and well they can find.

30:29.509 --> 30:32.294
SONYA: I keep thinking she's
gonna die alone out there.

30:37.493 --> 30:39.733
WADE: You thinking about Lisa?

30:42.492 --> 30:44.607
SONYA: Nobody came for her either.

30:46.278 --> 30:48.749
WADE: You can't think about
that kind of stuff, Sonya.

30:50.869 --> 30:52.859
You been to see him lately?

30:53.641 --> 30:54.930
- SONYA: No.
- WADE: No?

30:56.582 --> 30:58.052
SONYA: Wanted to.

30:58.352 --> 31:00.686
Drove all the way there and
couldn't get out of the truck.

31:00.806 --> 31:01.975
WADE: That's good.

31:02.219 --> 31:05.235
That's good 'cause there's
nothing there for you, Sonya.

31:06.305 --> 31:08.101
SONYA: I know.

31:09.108 --> 31:11.034
I visited her grave instead.

31:13.731 --> 31:16.584
WADE: Did you have a happy
thought like I told you?

31:20.989 --> 31:22.409
SONYA: I tried.

31:23.898 --> 31:25.657
I just couldn't think of anything.

31:27.853 --> 31:29.586
She's gone.

31:29.792 --> 31:30.731
WADE: Yes, she is,

31:30.787 --> 31:32.864
but that's why you got to
keep her in your thoughts.

31:33.290 --> 31:34.886
Got to remember the good times.

31:34.898 --> 31:37.269
Hell, you got to remember the
times she really pissed you off.

31:37.288 --> 31:39.603
- (Sonya chuckles)
- You got to hold on to those.

31:41.348 --> 31:42.950
SONYA: It's hard.

32:00.321 --> 32:01.760
GEDMAN: Entering.

32:02.792 --> 32:04.225
HELLER: Copy that.

32:05.989 --> 32:07.147
(Marco groaning)

32:07.178 --> 32:08.505
FRYE: What? What's... what's wrong?

32:08.536 --> 32:09.793
MARCO: I don't like this.

32:09.913 --> 32:10.726
(door creaks)

32:32.093 --> 32:33.545
GEDMAN: Diet Coke with lime.

32:57.384 --> 32:58.904
SONYA: Not here.

32:59.888 --> 33:01.331
WADE: I hope we're not wasting our time.

33:01.369 --> 33:03.653
Cooper says there's nothing
at the Desantis oil field.

33:03.721 --> 33:05.104
SONYA: Any others in this area?

33:05.874 --> 33:07.813
WADE: Old Parch ranch has got wells.

33:13.711 --> 33:15.269
BARTENDER: You Ralph Gedman?

33:15.557 --> 33:16.752
GEDMAN: Yeah.

33:16.872 --> 33:18.216
BARTENDER: Supposed to give you this.

33:18.597 --> 33:19.736
Message for you.

33:19.783 --> 33:20.915
HELLER: We have contact.

33:20.916 --> 33:22.982
MARCO: Let's take him. We should take him.

33:23.102 --> 33:25.483
HELLER: Hold. Hold a beat.

33:35.965 --> 33:37.316
(gasps softly)

33:45.787 --> 33:47.057
HELLER: What is it?

33:47.407 --> 33:48.239
Gedman?

33:48.359 --> 33:49.171
Gedman?

33:49.434 --> 33:50.923
- (Marco groans)
- Gedman, do you copy?

33:50.940 --> 33:52.417
(Marco speaks Spanish)

34:01.522 --> 34:02.561
SONYA: Down there!

34:02.681 --> 34:04.319
On the right.

34:11.864 --> 34:14.266
(Sonya panting)

34:20.717 --> 34:22.413
SONYA: She's alive.

34:27.710 --> 34:28.705
MARCO: Okay, great.

34:29.312 --> 34:30.931
They got Maria. She's safe.

34:30.962 --> 34:32.326
FRYE (chuckles): Hey, that's great.

34:33.590 --> 34:35.210
TECH: Sir, I lost him.

34:35.223 --> 34:36.592
HELLER: What do you mean you lost him?

34:36.618 --> 34:37.838
TECH: His signal's not moving.

34:37.869 --> 34:40.053
- MARCO: What the hell's going on here?
- HELLER: Move in. Now.

34:40.272 --> 34:43.362
(engine revving)

34:48.842 --> 34:51.996
(Maria wheezing) (Maria coughs)

34:52.190 --> 34:53.697
WADE: Where is that EMT at?

34:53.754 --> 34:55.011
COOPER: He's five out.

34:55.530 --> 34:57.445
WADE: Something's going down at the drop.

34:57.462 --> 34:58.614
SONYA: I don't want to leave her.

34:58.621 --> 35:01.004
WADE: Yeah, well, the
ambulance will be here soon.

35:01.124 --> 35:03.050
That bar's just down the road. Come on.

35:03.107 --> 35:04.640
COOPER: I'll take care of her.

35:09.439 --> 35:11.128
All right, just a little bit of water.

35:11.248 --> 35:13.674
(tires screeching)

35:28.747 --> 35:30.123
MAN: FBI!

35:31.168 --> 35:32.575
HELLER: Where'd he go?

35:32.695 --> 35:34.384
- Where'd he go?!
- BARTENDER: Out the back!

35:35.322 --> 35:36.636
MARCO: What happened? Huh?

35:36.692 --> 35:37.299
What happened?

35:37.343 --> 35:38.882
BARTENDER: I was... I was
told to give him a phone.

35:38.907 --> 35:40.546
He played the message and he left.

35:41.091 --> 35:42.854
MARCO: Who told you to give him the phone?

35:42.923 --> 35:43.730
BARTENDER: I don't know.

35:43.755 --> 35:44.875
I went to the bathroom.

35:44.881 --> 35:46.264
There was an envelope on the...

35:46.302 --> 35:47.916
on the bar with a note, some money.

35:47.953 --> 35:49.017
The phone was in there.

35:49.087 --> 35:51.125
I figured it was some
kind of practical joke.

35:52.858 --> 35:54.679
MARCO: Do you know what was in the phone?

35:54.947 --> 35:56.180
BARTENDER: I don't know.

35:56.567 --> 35:58.663
Whatever it was, man, he looked sick.

36:01.692 --> 36:03.738
(phone chimes)

36:11.158 --> 36:12.824
FRYE:  I got to take a leak.

36:18.362 --> 36:20.176
HELLER: Join him on that side.

36:20.232 --> 36:21.108
Follow me!

36:21.228 --> 36:23.123
- MARCO: Any sign of Gedman?!
- HELLER: Nothing.

36:23.243 --> 36:24.318
MARCO: The killer is here!

36:24.361 --> 36:26.238
HELLER: We're setting
up a secure perimeter.

37:40.910 --> 37:42.956
FRYE: Oh, shit.

37:44.589 --> 37:46.854
Ov... over here.

37:47.173 --> 37:48.900
Over here!

37:53.313 --> 37:54.571
(tires screech)

37:59.169 --> 38:00.551
WADE: Call Marco.

38:02.038 --> 38:02.804
(phone ringing)

38:05.169 --> 38:06.868
- MARCO: Hello.
- SONYA: Marco.

38:06.887 --> 38:08.570
MARCO: Hey, Sonya, you're here?

38:08.907 --> 38:10.165
SONYA: It's not good.

38:10.371 --> 38:11.516
We lost him.

38:11.735 --> 38:13.375
Come on out.

38:14.100 --> 38:17.704
(Marco grunting) (Marco panting)

38:22.259 --> 38:24.217
MARCO: I... I... I have a family.

38:24.234 --> 38:26.518
Please don't do it.

38:33.121 --> 38:37.471
(shouts) (grunts)

38:56.925 --> 38:59.640
- (chain rattling)
- SONYA: Marco!

39:02.371 --> 39:04.371
(Marco groans) (Marco groans)

39:08.673 --> 39:10.494
- Are you okay?
- MARCO: Yes.

39:10.614 --> 39:11.795
SONYA: Why didn't he kill you?

39:11.851 --> 39:13.409
MARCO: I don't know. The money?

39:13.529 --> 39:14.892
WADE: It's here.

39:16.400 --> 39:17.977
(steady electronic chiming)

39:26.182 --> 39:27.527
I... geez...

39:28.061 --> 39:30.070
(Marco groans)

39:35.112 --> 39:37.177
(Cristina speaking over video)

39:37.614 --> 39:39.197
WADE: The same video.

39:44.791 --> 39:46.962
(Cristina speaking Spanish)

39:52.217 --> 39:53.769
SONYA: Gedman.
