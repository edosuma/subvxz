00:38.338 --> 00:40.431
Huh? What was that?

00:42.675 --> 00:46.111
Bad news. I just called
every public course in Heimlich County...

00:46.212 --> 00:47.611
and they're all booked up.

00:47.814 --> 00:50.408
It's that dang PGA tournament
they're gonna be playing...

00:50.517 --> 00:52.314
over at the Nine Rivers Country Club.

00:53.253 --> 00:56.882
Tiger Woods comes to town
and everyone's a golfer.

00:58.491 --> 01:01.255
You know, it's times like these
when it seems crazy...

01:01.361 --> 01:04.262
that we don't have
our own backyard putting green.

01:04.431 --> 01:05.762
I don't know, Hank.

01:05.865 --> 01:08.629
Taking care of a putting green
means extra watering...

01:08.735 --> 01:11.260
extra mowing, more fertilizing.

01:11.404 --> 01:14.100
Our lives would be nothing but lawn care.

01:17.110 --> 01:19.169
Let's go! Let's go!
Let's build a putting green!

01:19.279 --> 01:20.268
Yeah!

01:20.380 --> 01:23.816
This is one small step for man...

01:23.917 --> 01:27.478
one giant leap for golfkind.

01:33.960 --> 01:37.418
Well, I've been asking for a batting cage
since the day we moved in.

01:37.530 --> 01:38.497
Bobby?

01:40.100 --> 01:42.125
-Shush!
-Hey, it's a backyard golf course.

01:42.235 --> 01:43.896
Regular redneck country club.

01:44.003 --> 01:46.403
How many food stamps
it cost to play a round?

01:48.608 --> 01:52.009
Well, it's better than the putting green
you have in your back yard.

01:52.445 --> 01:55.471
Oh, wait, guys.
Kahn doesn't have one, does he?

01:56.082 --> 01:57.947
Let's see. He's got a hammock...

01:58.051 --> 02:01.384
trampoline, a shed, a built-in grill.

02:01.721 --> 02:05.623
No. No putting green, Hank.
Your joke is completely accurate.

02:05.725 --> 02:08.853
What I need to clutter my backyard
with rinky-dink putting green for?

02:08.961 --> 02:11.590
I'm joining Nine Rivers Country Club.

02:12.265 --> 02:14.631
-Kahn, you're a lucky ducky!
-Yeah.

02:14.734 --> 02:17.703
Next weekend I'll be in members-only box
on fourth hole cheering for...

02:17.804 --> 02:20.932
Eldrick ""Tiger"" Woods
as he pumps his fist in victory.

02:21.040 --> 02:23.372
-Maybe I'll high-five him.
-Bobby?

02:23.610 --> 02:25.373
-Shush it!
-I'm not finished!

02:25.478 --> 02:27.446
Yeah, that's right. The fourth hole.

02:27.547 --> 02:30.846
Signature hole at Nine Rivers.

02:31.551 --> 02:34.384
KAHN: From the tee,
a deep raviie separates the golfer,,,

02:34.487 --> 02:37.923
from a two-tiered, zoysia-grass greei,

02:38.024 --> 02:41.551
The greei is jealously guarded
from behiid by iative marshlaids,

02:41.661 --> 02:46.598
Aid ii froit by buikers, which eicircle it
like a straid of rare pearls,

02:46.833 --> 02:49.563
No woider this 175-yard masterpiece,,,

02:49.669 --> 02:52.137
cai become either
a portrait of frustratioi,,,

02:52.238 --> 02:55.298
or oie of uiequalled joy,

02:57.310 --> 02:58.277
[Kahn clapping]

02:58.678 --> 03:02.114
Dream over, rednecks.
Time to return to putt-putt nightmare.

03:03.716 --> 03:07.015
The hell with Kahn!
You know, we've already got the green.

03:07.220 --> 03:10.053
We can put in a fairway
and make an exact replica...

03:10.156 --> 03:12.590
of the fourth hole right here in the alley.

03:12.692 --> 03:14.557
According to my truck odometer...

03:14.661 --> 03:17.858
Boomhauer's place is exactly
a tenth of a mile from here.

03:17.964 --> 03:21.525
-That's 176 yards.
-I don't follow your math...

03:21.634 --> 03:24.569
but I'm moved by your passion. Go on.

03:24.704 --> 03:28.105
Well, you see,
the alley is sort of like a big ravine.

03:28.241 --> 03:30.801
-Especially when the sewer backs up.
-Sorry.

03:31.477 --> 03:34.105
And Kahn's yard might as well be
a sand trap.

03:34.214 --> 03:36.444
Nothing that lands in there's
ever coming back.

03:36.549 --> 03:40.041
BlLL: And we could arrange those garbage
cans just like a string of pearls.

03:40.153 --> 03:41.313
That'll show Kahn.

03:41.654 --> 03:44.088
Why you tell hillbillies
we get into Nine Rivers?

03:44.190 --> 03:45.987
I was just trying to make them feel bad.

03:46.092 --> 03:48.617
But it backfire
and wind up bumming me out!

03:48.728 --> 03:51.526
Nine Rivers turn us down
six times already.

03:51.631 --> 03:55.260
Last time they send rejection letter,
we not even mail in application.

03:55.401 --> 03:58.700
I'm tired of feeling
like rare orchid growing...

03:58.805 --> 04:01.706
from giant pile of dung that is this alley.

04:01.808 --> 04:04.936
Nine Rivers is only all-Asian country club
in Heimlich County.

04:05.044 --> 04:07.672
We all-Asian. We should be there.

04:07.914 --> 04:10.883
All right. Then this time,
we not use proper channels.

04:12.385 --> 04:13.818
Call Ted Wassanasong.

04:14.087 --> 04:16.680
He now the big muckamuck
on membership committee.

04:16.789 --> 04:20.519
We invite him over, fill him with the liquor
and pop the question.

04:21.694 --> 04:25.562
Dare I dream it?
Nine Rivers will be our new home.

04:25.665 --> 04:27.360
We eat there, shower there.

04:27.467 --> 04:30.129
We only have to come back here
to pick up invitations...

04:30.236 --> 04:32.602
to next party at Nine Rivers!

04:35.875 --> 04:38.844
What happens if my tee shot
lands on a bird's back...

04:38.945 --> 04:40.776
and he carries it out of bounds
but then is attacked...

04:42.148 --> 04:45.208
by a larger bird who grabs the ball
and drops it in the hole?

04:45.351 --> 04:48.684
Is that still a hole-in-one?
Because that's how I'm gonna play it.

04:48.988 --> 04:53.015
Dang it, Dale. It already happened once.
What are the odds of it happening again?

04:54.560 --> 04:56.425
Hi-ya!

05:00.667 --> 05:04.535
How hard would it have been to say we
had to pick up Uncle Vong at the airport?

05:04.637 --> 05:05.626
Not very!

05:06.205 --> 05:09.470
Well, we've been forbidding
Chang to date Connie.

05:09.575 --> 05:11.702
Let's have dinner
and remind ourselves why.

05:11.811 --> 05:15.269
Greetings, Ted and Cindy Wassanasong!

05:15.415 --> 05:17.315
It's been too long!

05:17.450 --> 05:21.147
We just had you over a few....
Well, yeah, we meant to.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.721
Say, the alarm in my Mercedes is
on the fritz.

05:23.923 --> 05:25.982
Am I going to be okay on the street?

05:26.292 --> 05:29.125
Or should you move your car
and let me park in the garage?

05:29.228 --> 05:30.252
Rest easy.

05:30.363 --> 05:33.855
The only crime here is
how much taxes are going up...

05:33.966 --> 05:36.298
due to skyrocketing property values.

05:43.109 --> 05:46.738
So I hear very funny joke the other day.

05:46.846 --> 05:50.646
Takes place at Nine Rivers Country Club.
You ever been there?

05:50.817 --> 05:53.012
-We're charter members.
-Really?

05:53.219 --> 05:55.551
I'm not the type
to keep track of these things.

05:58.424 --> 06:01.154
-And the joke?
-Oh. Yes.

06:02.862 --> 06:04.693
Actually, Minh the big joke-teller.

06:07.200 --> 06:10.397
Man walks into a bar, it's Kahn!

06:10.503 --> 06:12.596
He's incredibly successful!

06:13.606 --> 06:16.166
Oh, wait. That's not a joke.
It really happened.

06:16.275 --> 06:19.972
Please. Ted and Cindy do not want
to hear about my success.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.541
I'm sure they would rather taste it...

06:22.982 --> 06:25.382
by means of your filet mignon.

06:28.888 --> 06:29.980
Eight.

06:33.259 --> 06:34.317
Come, Ted.

06:34.427 --> 06:38.124
Let us repair to the lanai.
The sunset awaits us.

06:38.231 --> 06:39.528
And that's not all.

06:42.101 --> 06:43.068
Cohibas!

06:44.737 --> 06:45.761
Super nice.

06:46.005 --> 06:47.836
We'll never smoke them all tonight.

06:47.940 --> 06:51.000
Good thing you have a private humidor
at Nine Rivers.

06:54.680 --> 06:58.639
Maybe we go there sometime,
watch PGA tournament together.

06:58.985 --> 07:01.146
Kahn, that's only for members.

07:01.320 --> 07:05.051
I think I see where you're going with this.
Let me help.

07:05.224 --> 07:06.748
I would be honored--

07:09.729 --> 07:10.753
KAHN: Hey, monkey!

07:11.030 --> 07:14.193
Get back on your unicycle,
go down to Williams-Sonoma...

07:14.300 --> 07:16.063
and buy me new martini pitcher!

07:16.169 --> 07:17.727
It was just an accident, Kahn.

07:17.837 --> 07:19.498
If that kind of thing bothers you...

07:19.605 --> 07:22.130
you shouldn't have bought a house
on a golf course.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.809
I must apologize for my neighbors.

07:25.912 --> 07:28.847
They build crude replica of fourth hole
at Nine Rivers...

07:28.948 --> 07:31.883
because they not good enough
to play there like you...

07:32.151 --> 07:33.118
and me.

07:33.719 --> 07:37.917
Hitting into this kind of wind, you've
got to play the ball back in your stance.

07:38.124 --> 07:41.150
Keep it low.
Then just watch it bite and hold.

07:41.527 --> 07:45.019
Huh. Not a lot of guys know
how to hit a decent knockdown shot.

07:45.131 --> 07:47.224
Just takes practice. Cigar?

07:47.333 --> 07:48.698
Oh, don't mind if l....

07:49.469 --> 07:52.438
Oh, you probably didn't realize it,
but this is Cuban.

07:52.839 --> 07:56.866
-I'll just go ahead and destroy it for you.
-Good one.

07:56.976 --> 07:59.968
You know, anybody who went to
all this trouble to build a replica...

08:00.079 --> 08:02.013
really ought to try the real thing.

08:02.114 --> 08:05.277
How would you like to play
Nine Rivers tomorrow as my guest?

08:06.285 --> 08:08.879
Well, that would be.... Wow!

08:09.322 --> 08:12.450
I'll get us a 9:00 tee time.
And bring a friend.

08:15.261 --> 08:18.662
Oh, Kahn, I almost forgot. Bye.

08:20.366 --> 08:22.391
Well, this evening wasn't
a complete waste.

08:22.502 --> 08:25.335
Looks like Nine Rivers has finally found
its white guy.

08:25.438 --> 08:28.202
I think you got the best one of the lot, too.

08:28.441 --> 08:32.308
Yes. There's no two ways about it.
He's super white!

08:35.815 --> 08:39.342
If I'm gonna play a fancy-smancy club
like Nine Rivers...

08:39.452 --> 08:42.352
I'd better go sew a pom-pom
to the top of my hat.

08:42.455 --> 08:44.514
I've never golfed with a caddie before.

08:44.624 --> 08:47.718
-I'm gonna treat him like crap.
-Now, hold on.

08:47.827 --> 08:51.695
That Wassanasong fellow said
I could bring a friend.

08:52.064 --> 08:54.760
I'm sure of it. He enunciates very clearly.

08:55.401 --> 08:58.234
-Bill's out!
-No, I'm okay. I can still play!

08:58.337 --> 09:00.828
I haven't decided who I'm taking yet.

09:01.107 --> 09:03.302
Frankly, I'm leaning towards Boomhauer.

09:03.476 --> 09:06.877
But Boomhauer has a bad shoulder.

09:07.480 --> 09:10.574
Knock it off.
Now, I'm thinking of a number.

09:10.683 --> 09:12.810
DALE: Three.
HANK: Yes.

09:12.952 --> 09:15.716
Wingo. He always picks three.

09:15.922 --> 09:17.514
Except when he picks five.

09:21.260 --> 09:23.251
Here are your clubs, sir.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.524
So beautiful.

09:30.369 --> 09:32.496
So goddang beautiful.

09:32.605 --> 09:33.572
[Car honking]

09:33.673 --> 09:36.801
Sorry, Hank. I'm not gonna be able
to golf with you today as...

09:36.909 --> 09:40.504
I have to go to the bank
and make an unexpected deposit.

09:44.150 --> 09:46.414
Howdy, neighbor. Need a fourth?

09:46.519 --> 09:47.508
Kahn?

09:47.620 --> 09:49.713
Hey, I thought I said to bring a friend.

09:49.855 --> 09:52.449
What happened to the two skinny guys
or the fat one?

09:52.558 --> 09:55.425
Hank prefers my company.
And who can blame him?

09:55.528 --> 09:58.053
Yes. Well, Hank,
I'll show you to the locker room...

09:58.164 --> 10:00.155
so you can change into your clothes.

10:00.633 --> 10:02.624
Uh, these are my clothes.

10:03.035 --> 10:05.265
Oh, I'm sorry. It's my fault.

10:05.471 --> 10:07.666
I should have told you
about our dress code.

10:07.807 --> 10:10.742
-No denim nor T-shirts.
-Ted is powerful man.

10:10.843 --> 10:15.405
But he cannot change club policy.
You put him in very awkward position.

10:15.881 --> 10:17.746
-I think you should go.
-Nonsense.

10:21.020 --> 10:23.682
Let's get you fixed up
at the pro shop, Hank. My treat.

10:26.192 --> 10:30.094
Hank, I want you to meet the chairman
of our membership committee, Mr. Ho.

10:30.196 --> 10:31.424
He'll be our fourth.

10:41.307 --> 10:42.672
What are they saying?

10:42.775 --> 10:44.970
How should I know?
They're speaking Chinese.

10:45.077 --> 10:46.408
I look Chinese to you?

10:48.447 --> 10:51.473
Mr. Ho says, ""Let's do it, Hank.
Let's play some golf.""

10:52.118 --> 10:53.449
Don't be nervous.

10:53.619 --> 10:56.520
The first shot only sets tone for entire day.

11:04.296 --> 11:05.524
Super nice.

11:05.631 --> 11:07.394
Looks like this guy's a golfer.

11:27.953 --> 11:30.979
Here it is, Hank. Number four.
The signature hole.

11:37.697 --> 11:38.994
Pinch me, Mr. Ho.

11:46.539 --> 11:47.801
Hillbilly!

11:48.174 --> 11:50.267
God dang it! Dang.

11:56.615 --> 11:59.243
Damn it, Kahn!
Do you want to join Nine Rivers?

11:59.385 --> 12:00.545
Oh, Ted, thank you, yes!

12:00.653 --> 12:03.884
Well, you can forget it
unless you make Mr. Ho see...

12:03.989 --> 12:06.355
that Hank would be
the perfect Nine Rivers member.

12:06.592 --> 12:09.891
What? Why are you so interested
in that chicken-fried loser?

12:10.062 --> 12:12.724
If we don't attract
at least one non-Asian member...

12:12.865 --> 12:15.891
the PGA is going to pull the tournament
from Nine Rivers.

12:16.168 --> 12:19.433
You deliver me Hank,
and I'll put you up for junior membership.

12:19.538 --> 12:21.267
You will offer me full membership.

12:21.373 --> 12:23.034
-Associate membership.
-Full membership!

12:23.142 --> 12:24.200
Done.

12:34.687 --> 12:36.814
Hole-in-one! Hole-in-one!

12:37.089 --> 12:39.922
That was my second shot
and it didn't even go in.

12:40.226 --> 12:43.389
Look at this guy.
A perfect swing, a sense of humor...

12:43.596 --> 12:46.429
and that magnificent head of hair.

12:46.532 --> 12:50.161
Some poor sap is walking around
with nothing because this guy has it all.

12:58.577 --> 12:59.737
I hate Hank.

13:00.412 --> 13:05.281
Leaving us to play with his fancy new
friends on his fancy-ass golf course.

13:06.685 --> 13:09.449
Oh, God, I hope he comes back.
I love Hank.

13:09.688 --> 13:13.283
He abandoned you, Bill.
Quit being such a doormat.

13:18.430 --> 13:19.795
Pathetic.

13:22.434 --> 13:25.870
It was awfully nice of you to drive
your cart down to the 7-Eleven...

13:26.038 --> 13:27.505
to get my brand, Kahn.

13:27.606 --> 13:30.040
I'll make sure we stock Alamo here
from now on, Hank.

13:30.176 --> 13:33.145
That's the level of service
Nine Rivers offers its members.

13:33.479 --> 13:37.245
I guess that's my clumsy way of saying
I hope you'll be one.

13:37.683 --> 13:38.809
Whoa!

13:39.251 --> 13:41.515
Well, I'm flattered.
But I could never afford--

13:41.620 --> 13:45.249
Oh, no. It's surprisingly affordable.
Especially for new members.

13:45.357 --> 13:47.757
What do you pay for greens fees
at the public course?

13:47.893 --> 13:49.019
$1 1.

13:51.030 --> 13:52.930
Our rates are competitive with that.

13:53.065 --> 13:57.764
Well, no offense, but isn't Nine Rivers
an all-Oriental club?

13:58.037 --> 14:01.473
All-Asian? No. At least not by design.

14:01.574 --> 14:03.565
You see, this club was founded...

14:03.676 --> 14:06.406
by an immigrant Vietnamese
hot-sauce tycoon...

14:06.512 --> 14:09.675
after he was excluded from
all the other clubs in Heimlich County.

14:09.815 --> 14:13.512
The first members were his friends,
who also happened to be Asian.

14:13.752 --> 14:16.846
And then their friends joined, also Asian.
And so on.

14:17.957 --> 14:19.584
It's kind of like Arlen Lanes.

14:19.692 --> 14:22.661
Their Tuesday night league's
nothing but locksmiths.

14:24.129 --> 14:27.394
Still, I don't really know anyone here.

14:28.968 --> 14:30.299
Oh, but you will.

14:31.170 --> 14:34.037
Hank, everyone at Nine Rivers
come from different places.

14:34.139 --> 14:36.437
Laos, China, Vietnam, Cambodia...

14:36.542 --> 14:39.909
Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand,
South Korea.

14:40.145 --> 14:43.603
But we all have one thing in common.
Our love of golf.

14:44.416 --> 14:46.111
Join us, brother.

14:46.719 --> 14:48.050
Think about it, Hank.

14:48.254 --> 14:51.883
Talk it over with your wife, Peggy,
and son Bobby, age 13.

14:54.860 --> 14:56.088
Black car!

14:57.329 --> 14:59.092
Oh, it's just a hearse.

14:59.531 --> 15:03.126
Nine Rivers Club car is Continental
with spoked wheels and a landau roof.

15:03.502 --> 15:06.596
If we're voted in, Mr. Ho will pull up...

15:06.872 --> 15:10.899
present membership card,
parking decals, official windbreaker....

15:12.344 --> 15:14.175
Please, Hank Hill, say yes!

15:15.114 --> 15:17.378
-ls that a Continental?
-Yes. Yes.

15:18.651 --> 15:19.879
We're in!

15:20.619 --> 15:23.179
You joined an all-Asian country club?

15:23.389 --> 15:26.552
Peggy, Nine Rivers isn't about
whether you're Asian or not.

15:26.859 --> 15:30.556
It's about golf and friendship.
You'll see what I mean tonight.

15:30.663 --> 15:33.257
There's a big banquet
to welcome the PGA.

15:33.432 --> 15:35.923
-Boy, I hope they have forks.
-All right, Hank...

15:36.302 --> 15:40.295
what I'm about to say
is not politically correct, but here goes.

15:41.006 --> 15:42.473
This whole thing seems odd.

15:48.814 --> 15:53.478
-Hank Hill, so nice to see you.
-Hank, how's my favorite new member?

15:54.520 --> 15:58.820
Wow! Forgive me for saying this,
Peggy Hill, but you are super hot.

16:00.826 --> 16:02.259
You are forgiven.

16:05.364 --> 16:08.959
If I had a daughter,
here is where she would marry your son.

16:11.203 --> 16:12.795
Hey, Hank Hill.

16:13.072 --> 16:16.041
-I save you seat at new-member table.
-Hold on, Hank.

16:16.208 --> 16:19.006
There are some people from the PGA
I'd like you to meet.

16:19.211 --> 16:22.738
You know, Ted,
I'm a member of the PGA myself.

16:24.283 --> 16:26.774
The ""Propane Gas Association.""

16:29.021 --> 16:31.785
Because I sell
propane and propane accessories.

16:36.028 --> 16:38.826
Oh, Hank, you are out of control.

16:41.233 --> 16:43.531
I don't really know anybody up there.

16:43.635 --> 16:48.038
Nonsense. You know Mr. Ho.
And this is the founder of our club...

16:48.407 --> 16:50.875
-Mr. Tranh.
-The hot-sauce guy?

16:53.946 --> 16:55.880
You look much younger on the label.

16:55.981 --> 16:59.644
-Ah, there's a rooster on the label.
-Peggy is just joking.

16:59.752 --> 17:02.243
You'll find the Hills have
a wicked sense of humor.

17:04.455 --> 17:06.651
And these gentlemen are from the PGA.

17:07.893 --> 17:11.056
This is Hank Hill,
one of our most respected members.

17:11.195 --> 17:12.321
Howdy.

17:12.765 --> 17:16.359
I must say, Hank, you seem very
down-to-earth for a man of your wealth.

17:17.102 --> 17:19.935
-Well, enjoy dinner.
-Aren't you sitting here?

17:20.039 --> 17:23.974
No, the dais is reserved
for honored guests and new members.

17:24.276 --> 17:26.175
But Kahn and Minh are new.

17:31.850 --> 17:35.752
Hank, I'm not sure,
but I think we are gods to them.

17:36.021 --> 17:38.489
Good eveiiig, Before we get started,,,

17:38.757 --> 17:41.248
wait staff, table 28 ieeds

17:41.660 --> 17:45.289
Now, I hope every member has writtei

17:45.597 --> 17:48.088
Toiight we ha ve a very special prize,

17:48.200 --> 17:52.933
A practice rouid of golf with the greatest
Asiai player ii the history of the game,

17:53.105 --> 17:54.197
Tiger Woods,

17:57.142 --> 18:00.543
Aid the wiiier is,,,,
Oh, my goodiess, Haik Hill!

18:00.879 --> 18:02.710
There it is, Haik Hill,

18:02.815 --> 18:05.682
You won! Golf with Tiger Woods!

18:15.461 --> 18:17.053
Coigratulatiois, Haik Hill,

18:17.496 --> 18:19.760
But the real wiiier here is Tiger,

18:19.998 --> 18:23.024
I hear Haik got
a hole-ii-oie the other day,

18:23.135 --> 18:25.603
If you wait to take your picture with Haik,
he 'll be ii the lobby later,

18:27.506 --> 18:29.371
The liie starts with me,

18:32.478 --> 18:35.743
T ed, you fixed the raffle.
I could go to jail for this.

18:35.881 --> 18:38.406
Oh, that. That's just a club tradition.

18:38.584 --> 18:41.951
-The new member always wins.
-Then why didn't Kahn win?

18:42.121 --> 18:45.318
He's a new member.
Why didn't Kahn sit at the head table?

18:45.557 --> 18:48.651
Why did I get prime rib
and everyone else got eggplant?

18:49.495 --> 18:52.464
-Everything okay, Ted?
-Great. Everything's fine.

18:52.898 --> 18:54.365
Then explain this.

18:55.534 --> 18:57.729
Look, the PGA was going to cancel
the tournament here...

18:57.836 --> 19:00.430
because we didn't have
any non-Asian members.

19:00.572 --> 19:02.972
We told them
Fred Chung was from Hawaii.

19:03.075 --> 19:04.565
But they said that wouldn't cut it.

19:04.676 --> 19:07.804
So you only like me
because of the color of my skin?

19:08.514 --> 19:11.540
It wasn't my swing or my sense of humor?

19:11.683 --> 19:14.652
Hank, it's not like
you're not getting anything out of this.

19:14.753 --> 19:17.415
You got the hat, the slacks,
a round with Tiger Woods...

19:17.523 --> 19:21.482
-and a $40,000 membership.
-$40,000?

19:21.827 --> 19:23.226
You said it was $1 1.

19:23.328 --> 19:28.027
Hank, I will admit I first asked you to join
because you are white.

19:28.433 --> 19:32.164
Now I'm asking you to stay
because you are you.

19:32.538 --> 19:33.903
My friend.

19:34.239 --> 19:35.968
Can I ask you one more question?

19:36.875 --> 19:40.834
What and what accessories
do I sell for a living?

19:43.148 --> 19:44.240
Tractors?

19:48.554 --> 19:53.218
-To be fair, you used to sell tractors.
-Yeah, but Ted didn't know that.

19:53.692 --> 19:55.353
And even though Nine Rivers had...

19:55.460 --> 19:58.918
the most perfectly groomed zoysia grass
I've ever seen...

19:59.064 --> 20:01.760
there was something it didn't have.
You guys.

20:03.202 --> 20:05.670
And perfectly groomed kakuya grass...

20:06.104 --> 20:09.073
which grows more upright
and gives a cleaner cut.

20:13.278 --> 20:14.267
What the....

20:14.379 --> 20:17.280
I knew I left my beer
in a hole somewhere.

20:19.785 --> 20:20.979
[Kahn screaming]

20:22.154 --> 20:24.145
Hank Hill! What you do?

20:24.256 --> 20:26.918
Have I not suffered enough in this life
as your neighbor?

20:27.025 --> 20:29.585
Now that you quit,
they take away my membership.

20:29.795 --> 20:32.559
Well, I'm sorry, Kahn,
but I could not stay there.

20:32.664 --> 20:34.325
I just didn't feel comfortable.

20:34.499 --> 20:38.799
That's why I left Jeans West, that's why
I don't bowl on Tuesday nights, and....

20:39.705 --> 20:43.573
-Forget it. You wouldn't understand.
-Oh, yeah. You right.

20:43.809 --> 20:46.209
I always feel comfortable everywhere I go.

20:46.311 --> 20:48.802
You know, my original name is Smith.

20:48.914 --> 20:51.906
I just changed it to Souphanousinphone
when I moved to Texas.

20:54.586 --> 20:55.883
Just relax.

20:56.288 --> 20:59.587
Breathe in the tranquility.
Breathe out the frustration.

21:00.592 --> 21:02.856
You're in a better place than Nine Rivers.

21:03.862 --> 21:08.299
There is no place better than Nine Rivers.
Oh, this is it?

21:08.734 --> 21:10.634
This is the rest of our lives?

21:11.069 --> 21:14.436
Maybe I divorce you and marry someone
who's already a member.

21:14.539 --> 21:15.972
Oh, Kahn.

21:17.909 --> 21:18.876
[Knocking on door]

21:21.446 --> 21:23.437
Fine. You can play through.

21:23.548 --> 21:26.244
No, Kahn. We just came over
to give you something.

21:27.286 --> 21:28.947
Please! Not in the face.

21:34.326 --> 21:37.887
Dues are a six-pack every 18 holes.
What do you say?

21:40.799 --> 21:42.460
I accept your offer.

21:43.368 --> 21:45.836
And as new member,
I move we kick Dauterive out.

21:47.639 --> 21:49.436
Seriously. You're on the bubble.

22:28.246 --> 22:29.679
HANK: Piich me, Mr, Ho,
