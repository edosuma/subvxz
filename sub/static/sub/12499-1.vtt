00:48.797 --> 00:50.167
Take it all in, kids.

00:50.457 --> 00:52.607
This is nature in all it's majesty.

00:53.199 --> 00:55.449
Welcome to Brickleberry.

01:08.451 --> 01:10.010
Hey kids, I'm Steve Williams.

01:10.135 --> 01:12.585
Ranger of the month here at
Brickleberry National Park

01:14.901 --> 01:16.397
Don't say anything about
the amputee kid.

01:16.522 --> 01:18.233
Don't say anything about
the amputee kid.

01:18.551 --> 01:20.482
It's good to be here,
speaking to the nub scouts.

01:22.905 --> 01:24.484
Oh, great. Now it's awkward.

01:26.144 --> 01:26.667
That's better.

01:27.411 --> 01:29.453
Today, I'll be teaching you
how to build a campfire.

01:29.578 --> 01:31.491
Using flint and steel.

01:32.893 --> 01:35.980
Wow. That den mother is gorgeous.
I bet this will impress her.

01:37.158 --> 01:38.590
Sometimes it's a little tricky.

01:41.614 --> 01:42.474
God damn it.

01:45.354 --> 01:49.842
Okay kids, a true survivalist always
has a backup plan.

01:51.179 --> 01:52.452
There's still a little in there.

01:56.190 --> 01:58.800
Only you can prevent forest-

01:58.925 --> 02:00.264
Fire!

02:01.983 --> 02:02.842
Hold still!

02:02.967 --> 02:04.147
I'll beat the flames out.

02:07.298 --> 02:08.157
I like it.

02:13.624 --> 02:16.743
So, who do you think will be ranger
of the month this month, Denzel?

02:16.868 --> 02:17.539
Shut up Steve!

02:17.664 --> 02:19.512
We know it's always you.
No one else gives a shit.

02:19.841 --> 02:21.295
Well, I guess it is always me.

02:21.634 --> 02:22.494
The photos don't lie.

02:22.772 --> 02:25.658
- October, November, December.
- February.

02:26.215 --> 02:28.593
That's right, brother.
Black history month too.

02:28.718 --> 02:30.267
If you weren't so dumb,
I might be offended.

02:30.658 --> 02:32.557
Being ranger of the month
drives the ladies crazy.

02:32.939 --> 02:35.231
Why, just this morning,
I met this hot, young den mother.

02:35.356 --> 02:37.587
Young?
Man, old chicks is where it's at.

02:38.047 --> 02:40.752
They sweet, loyal,
and they can take out their teeth.

02:41.134 --> 02:43.266
- Are you being serious right now?
- Yeah, I'm serious.

02:43.606 --> 02:46.895
I've been in more
old white women than osteoporosis.

02:49.372 --> 02:49.658
What?

02:50.359 --> 02:51.154
Gum job, man.

02:52.587 --> 02:55.786
Malloy, I found those chocolate bars
you like, little buddy.

02:55.911 --> 02:58.046
They don't sell them around here, so,
you know, I had to drive all the way to-

02:58.171 --> 02:59.729
70% cacao?

02:59.854 --> 03:04.463
That's weird, because I'm pretty sure
I said a minimum of 85% cacao.

03:04.588 --> 03:07.296
Well, they probably taste
the same, right? I mean...

03:10.032 --> 03:11.751
Okay, I'll just return these.

03:12.063 --> 03:15.702
- Good morning, Malloy, How are you?
- Your head is enormous.

03:16.922 --> 03:18.385
Don't forget I'm the one
who rescued you

03:18.510 --> 03:20.741
after some crazy tourist
ran over both your parents.

03:21.600 --> 03:23.892
"The key to being a safe driver-"

03:26.518 --> 03:29.319
Oh, my god!
Wait, you're both still alive!

03:29.680 --> 03:30.730
I'll go call for help.

03:34.260 --> 03:34.854
Shit.

03:35.220 --> 03:37.374
All right, rangers,
do you know what that is?

03:37.618 --> 03:39.655
- Is that the devil's penis?
- No!

03:39.780 --> 03:41.326
It's our tourism numbers this year.

03:41.681 --> 03:43.138
Our park is in a shambles.

03:43.263 --> 03:46.095
We've had everything from
freak accidents to crime waves.

03:46.220 --> 03:48.546
Last week,
a group of tourists got carjacked!

03:48.840 --> 03:50.103
I got carjacked last week too.

03:50.910 --> 03:53.374
Easy, girl.
Let the Parkinson's do the work.

03:53.499 --> 03:55.551
The point is, crime is out of control.

03:55.964 --> 03:57.974
This is a national park, not Detroit.

03:58.242 --> 04:00.300
Oh, I see.
You all want to blame the brothers.

04:00.682 --> 04:03.515
Denzel, I don't indulge
in racial profiling.

04:03.640 --> 04:05.026
We'd all be safer if you did.

04:05.280 --> 04:09.322
Don't worry. I hired a Korean convenience
store owner to follow him around.

04:11.712 --> 04:13.908
Maybe less people
in the park is a good thing.

04:14.354 --> 04:16.646
We don't want to offset
the balance of nature.

04:17.505 --> 04:19.128
Everybody point and laugh at the hippie.

04:20.688 --> 04:21.738
Man, f*** nature!

04:22.311 --> 04:25.112
Malloy, you should be out there
greeting all those tourists,

04:25.237 --> 04:26.974
'Cause you're the cutest thing
on the planet.

04:27.099 --> 04:29.170
Malloy? We don't want him
talking to anyone.

04:29.295 --> 04:30.187
He's a dick!

04:30.510 --> 04:31.906
Even your whispers sound fat.

04:32.155 --> 04:33.571
How could you say that?

04:33.696 --> 04:35.736
Malloy does so many
thoughtful things for us.

04:35.861 --> 04:36.627
Yeah, like what?

04:36.752 --> 04:40.349
Like for starters, he made that delicious
breakfast you enjoyed this morning.

04:42.638 --> 04:45.153
And don't forget, he planned
that surprise party for Denzel.

04:47.476 --> 04:48.145
Surprise!

04:48.516 --> 04:50.436
Bottom line, if we don't get
this park in shape,

04:50.561 --> 04:52.123
they're gonna shut down Brickleberry!

04:52.248 --> 04:55.910
So, I've decided to hire someone to help
get this park back on track.

04:56.173 --> 04:59.060
- A new ranger?
- Old lady, old lady, old lady.

04:59.185 --> 05:02.066
Yes, a new ranger. She was
ranger of the month at Yellowstone.

05:02.191 --> 05:03.117
Rangers of the month?

05:09.504 --> 05:11.892
Sorry, that's my vagina growling.

05:12.624 --> 05:15.488
Well, okay, I'm really excited to-

05:16.905 --> 05:17.478
I'm really-

05:18.146 --> 05:18.846
excited-

05:20.485 --> 05:22.363
- Excited to work-
- You, you're no den mother.

05:22.488 --> 05:24.860
You were here to take my
ranger of the month title all along.

05:25.167 --> 05:28.139
That seems highly unlikely that
that's what she's here for, you moron

05:28.264 --> 05:29.966
You keep a bear cub
in the ranger station?

05:30.091 --> 05:32.909
Well, Steve brought him here,
but i raised him as my own.

05:33.141 --> 05:34.151
He's a house bear.

05:34.276 --> 05:36.399
There's no such thing as a house bear.

05:37.482 --> 05:38.277
What is he eating?

05:38.402 --> 05:40.696
This diet will take years off
his life, Woody.

05:40.962 --> 05:44.019
A bear cub's diet should consist
of berries miller moths, and grass.

05:44.144 --> 05:47.520
- Well, the new girl's annoying.
- Forgive me, Malloy. I failed you.

05:47.869 --> 05:49.795
No more junk food for you,
snuggly bear.

05:50.034 --> 05:54.076
You took away something I love.
Now I will take away something you love.

06:03.734 --> 06:06.774
Take a close look, honey, because
you'll never get to wear it.

06:06.899 --> 06:08.365
Look, I just want to help the park,

06:08.490 --> 06:10.498
and from what I've seen,
it needs a lot of help.

06:10.623 --> 06:13.106
I am not here to take anyone's medal,
or whatever that is.

06:14.061 --> 06:16.576
Sounds like Steve's afraid
of a little competition.

06:16.701 --> 06:18.294
Yeah, I could win that title.

06:19.073 --> 06:20.314
Oh, man, I'm just kidding.

06:20.439 --> 06:22.447
You crackers have fun working.
I'll be taking a nap.

06:22.753 --> 06:23.942
Come on, Tong King Pong.

06:25.909 --> 06:27.946
What? I can't fire him.

06:28.174 --> 06:31.431
We work for the government,
and he's B-L-A-C-K.

06:31.663 --> 06:32.679
No, that's okay.

06:32.804 --> 06:36.108
If you think you're man enough
to take this from me, then game on.

06:43.976 --> 06:46.395
Don't mind him. I'm Connie, by the way.

06:48.432 --> 06:49.419
Did you feel that?

06:50.023 --> 06:51.837
I think our periods just synchronized.

06:53.584 --> 06:57.116
Since I'm the top ranger here,
Woody asked if I'd show you around.

06:57.799 --> 07:00.143
Normally I don't give tours to liars.

07:00.268 --> 07:02.066
- I'm not a liar.
- That's a lie.

07:02.511 --> 07:04.803
Anyway, down there is Brickleberry Lake.

07:05.455 --> 07:08.607
Just last week, I saved a drowning man
that was knocked out by a jet ski.

07:09.116 --> 07:11.694
- Steve, come in, Steve, I got good news.
- Go ahead.

07:11.819 --> 07:14.844
That guy you hit with a jet ski decided
to forget the lawsuit.

07:15.320 --> 07:18.026
'Course he forgets everything now
'cause of all the brain damage.

07:20.731 --> 07:21.591
Thanks for that information.

07:22.036 --> 07:23.278
How'bout a little radio silence?

07:23.403 --> 07:25.188
Hold on, Malloy wants to talk to you.

07:25.313 --> 07:27.034
- No, I don't want-
- Steve.

07:27.908 --> 07:30.964
- Steve. Steve?
- What!

07:31.664 --> 07:34.752
Remember that time you got drunk and
thought the paper shredder was a vagina?

07:36.693 --> 07:37.426
Bastard.

07:38.540 --> 07:38.953
That's better.

07:40.067 --> 07:40.417
Steve.

07:52.541 --> 07:54.514
Malloy, how's the diet going, son?

07:55.644 --> 07:58.508
I didn't like it at first,
but I feel really healthy now.

07:59.384 --> 08:00.243
That's great, little buddy.

08:03.012 --> 08:05.909
I got two large supreme pies with
melty-cheese-filled butter crusts,

08:06.238 --> 08:07.564
Three dozen wings with extra ranch,

08:07.978 --> 08:10.365
two-liter coke,
and a cup of fried chicken fat.

08:10.843 --> 08:12.801
- That'll be 42 bucks.
- How'bout a car?

08:13.469 --> 08:14.424
Sweet.

08:16.684 --> 08:17.416
Malloy!

08:17.671 --> 08:20.217
I'm ashamed of you.
This diet is for your own good.

08:20.838 --> 08:23.703
I don't know what I'd do if I lost you,
snuggly bear.

08:24.132 --> 08:27.602
You know how bad my post-traumatic
stress was before you moved in?

08:28.040 --> 08:29.745
Pull the trigger. Do it.

08:29.870 --> 08:32.575
You don't have the balls.
Your mother never loved you.

08:34.357 --> 08:37.381
Anyway, I got to get back to work.
But I already made your lunch.

08:42.606 --> 08:43.751
Where's my car?

08:44.134 --> 08:45.121
Denzel!

08:47.858 --> 08:49.895
Woody, look. I saved a hiker.

08:50.500 --> 08:51.662
He's dead, Steve.

08:51.787 --> 08:54.622
- He was alive when I found him.
- This is unacceptable, Steve.

08:54.747 --> 08:55.800
You know what I'm gonna do?

08:55.925 --> 08:57.963
I'm gonna take away one
of your gold stars.

08:58.663 --> 08:59.395
No!

09:02.132 --> 09:03.437
I saw a bright light.

09:04.328 --> 09:05.474
Friggin' show-off.

09:05.599 --> 09:08.689
Good work, Ethel. You get one star
for saving that man's life.

09:08.921 --> 09:12.476
And one star because you have
a nice body and a okay face.

09:13.897 --> 09:14.979
Okay face?

09:15.759 --> 09:17.159
Minus, one star for attitude.

09:18.210 --> 09:20.247
She's still kicking your ass, Steve.

09:20.372 --> 09:23.134
- Well, how many stars do you have?
- Woody, give me 3 stars!

09:23.707 --> 09:25.394
Affirmative action.

09:25.903 --> 09:28.672
Technically, that's not affirmative action.
It's more like star welfare.

09:29.849 --> 09:31.568
Well, I guess I underestimated you.

09:31.997 --> 09:34.544
Not anymore. I'm going to destroy you.

09:34.824 --> 09:36.712
Listen, I didn't want
your stupid little medal.

09:36.837 --> 09:39.832
But now, I'm going to take it
just because I can.

09:39.957 --> 09:41.869
- I'm Connie, by the way.
- We already met.

09:45.035 --> 09:47.199
I'm drowning, help!

09:47.324 --> 09:48.473
Help!

11:05.094 --> 11:06.956
Can I see some I.D. please, honey?

11:11.131 --> 11:12.405
I don't think this is you.

11:12.530 --> 11:15.078
It is shocking that someone
with your instincts is working here.

11:18.325 --> 11:20.267
He robbed me! He robbed me!

11:20.392 --> 11:21.317
Oh, lord!

11:29.016 --> 11:29.812
No!

11:35.465 --> 11:36.865
Oh, God.

11:39.125 --> 11:39.985
Seriously?

11:41.322 --> 11:42.181
Oh, a cheeto.

11:44.186 --> 11:45.300
Oh, that actually had a happy ending.

11:49.756 --> 11:51.506
What the hell
do you thing you're doing?

11:51.631 --> 11:54.148
The order came in.
We're putting up this hot ranger.

11:54.273 --> 11:56.820
And taking down this ad for
The Rosie O'Donnell Show.

12:23.399 --> 12:25.945
- Come on.
- Looking for this?

12:27.664 --> 12:31.452
Come on in, man, I got tater chips,
candy, moon pies, whatever you want!

12:31.716 --> 12:33.074
You're not gonna rape me, are you?

12:33.302 --> 12:35.085
Do I look like a rapist to you?

12:35.210 --> 12:37.169
You look like exactly like a rapist.

12:37.294 --> 12:39.684
Oh, just 'cause I'm a redneck,
I'm a rapist?

12:39.809 --> 12:41.910
I'm a big, bad rapist.

12:42.142 --> 12:45.633
I guess that explains why I got
this duct tape and chloroform, right?

12:45.955 --> 12:47.372
You're really not helping your case.

12:47.497 --> 12:49.664
No, no, no, you think I'm a rapist.

12:49.912 --> 12:52.198
It's a good thing I got
this court order mandating

12:52.323 --> 12:55.126
that I stay 50 yards away from young'uns
and small animals.

12:55.406 --> 12:57.710
With my name on it right there.

12:57.835 --> 13:01.686
- Okay, I better be getting back.
- Did I mention I have chocolate?

13:03.341 --> 13:04.741
Well, maybe I can come in for a minute.

13:19.664 --> 13:22.210
- Holy shit.
- What are you doing in Ethel's cabin?

13:22.543 --> 13:25.521
I'm... wait. What are you doing
in the Ethel's cabin?

13:25.646 --> 13:26.690
Stalking her.

13:27.899 --> 13:28.982
I'm here for the pillow fight.

13:31.639 --> 13:32.530
What the hell?

13:33.278 --> 13:34.774
Oh, my God, that was close.

13:35.187 --> 13:37.256
But it's so awesome,
we have something in common.

13:37.733 --> 13:39.643
- What?
- We both like Ethel.

13:40.343 --> 13:42.444
Hold on. You'll love this.

13:43.080 --> 13:45.563
I call it my sniffy box.
Check it out.

13:47.660 --> 13:50.270
- You want a hit?
- You know... it's getting kind of late.

13:50.620 --> 13:53.612
Okay. Well, come by any time
you want to talk about Ethel.

13:54.026 --> 13:55.427
I think she's perfect.

13:55.809 --> 13:58.482
Well, except for the fact
that she's an alcoholic.

13:58.607 --> 13:59.214
She's a what?

13:59.851 --> 14:01.474
It says it right here in her diary.

14:01.919 --> 14:03.256
She's a bad drunk too.

14:03.734 --> 14:05.643
That's why she was fired
from Yellowstone.

14:06.448 --> 14:09.568
This is a tree, and I've had 11 abortions.

14:10.331 --> 14:11.891
What? Oops.

14:17.184 --> 14:18.012
What do you want?

14:18.616 --> 14:20.749
Look, we got off on the wrong foot.

14:20.874 --> 14:23.836
I came over to bury the hatchet
and say congratulations.

14:24.111 --> 14:26.222
It looks like we've got
a new top ranger.

14:26.513 --> 14:27.878
Let's celebrate!

14:28.200 --> 14:29.579
- I don't drink.
- Me neither.

14:29.704 --> 14:31.540
This is non-alcoholic vodka.

14:31.848 --> 14:33.779
You know what?
I don't want to celebrate with you.

14:34.102 --> 14:36.585
Ever since you found out that
I'm actually good at my job,

14:36.710 --> 14:37.954
You've been a total jerk to me.

14:38.079 --> 14:40.116
Well, I'll just leave the bottle so
you can celebrate by yourself.

14:41.803 --> 14:42.631
God damn it.

14:59.663 --> 15:02.989
Connie, when does Ethel start her period?

15:03.114 --> 15:06.077
In 3 hours, 12 minutes and 22 seconds.
Why?

15:18.722 --> 15:20.313
- Are you okay?
- Go away.

15:20.438 --> 15:22.318
Look, I shouldn't have been
so hard on you.

15:22.700 --> 15:25.183
I know it must be tough
having a new ranger like me around.

15:25.612 --> 15:27.108
I'm willing to forgive and forget.

15:30.325 --> 15:31.535
How'bout another hug?

15:34.940 --> 15:37.519
You know what?
I want to get this hug just right.

15:37.644 --> 15:40.001
- Steve, you're being silly-
- Hug me, bitch!

15:43.167 --> 15:44.122
To Brickleberry.

15:50.777 --> 15:51.955
Where the hell am I?

15:52.252 --> 15:54.023
Where the [bleep]'s that waffle house,
shit-breath?

15:54.148 --> 15:54.819
Ethel?

15:54.944 --> 15:57.748
Hey, I'd kick a baby in his face
for some hash browns.

15:57.873 --> 16:00.118
- Ethel?
- Shut up, agent [bleep] lips.

16:01.487 --> 16:02.924
This car is goes fast!

16:03.239 --> 16:05.350
Ethel, we're not in a car!

16:06.751 --> 16:07.515
Lock out!

16:08.597 --> 16:11.112
I'm sorry. You don't like my driving.
Then why don't you...

16:11.844 --> 16:13.467
I don't know how to fly a chopper!

16:17.054 --> 16:19.887
Hey, get out of the fast lane,
you stupid mountain.

16:22.465 --> 16:25.886
Ay, Santa Maria, I'm never going to
finish trimming these hedges.

16:34.106 --> 16:36.302
- May I take your order?
- Get a pen, Skank.

16:36.684 --> 16:37.671
I want a large...

16:39.899 --> 16:42.398
- Can you repeat that?
- I said I want a large...

16:44.658 --> 16:45.931
Thank you, drive around.

16:50.792 --> 16:53.275
I can't believe Woody fired you just
for killing all those orphans

16:53.400 --> 16:54.484
and a Colombian landscaper.

16:54.796 --> 16:55.825
I don't know what happened.

16:55.950 --> 16:58.402
It was like I was drunk,
but all I had was that coffee.

16:58.734 --> 17:01.712
Yeah, that is weird.
I thought all landscapers were Mexican.

17:03.370 --> 17:05.481
Look, Ethel, I'm sorry things
turned out like this.

17:05.818 --> 17:07.483
I'm actually kind of sad to see you go.

17:07.608 --> 17:09.848
Oh, it's nice to hear you say that.
Maybe...

17:09.973 --> 17:10.741
Oh, your cab's here.

17:14.073 --> 17:17.150
Steve! Where the hell have you been?
Malloy is missing.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.859
Denzel and I have been searching
the forest all morning.

17:20.247 --> 17:22.316
Wait, Denzel went into the forest?

17:22.441 --> 17:24.374
Yeah, he wasn't much help.

17:25.075 --> 17:27.671
Malloy! Malloy!

17:28.445 --> 17:30.287
- Why is that pipe moving?
- That's a snake.

17:30.563 --> 17:32.292
Yo, why those telephone poles so hairy?

17:32.417 --> 17:34.584
Those are trees. Jesus...

17:34.709 --> 17:36.523
Oh, shit! There's a flying mailbox.

17:36.808 --> 17:38.464
That's an owl, you idiot.

17:39.163 --> 17:41.933
You and Ethel need to get out there
and find Malloy now.

17:42.187 --> 17:43.811
Actually, you fired Ethel this morning.

17:47.610 --> 17:48.470
Ethel!

17:50.507 --> 17:53.117
Why did you let me do
a stupid thing like that,

17:53.242 --> 17:56.555
You dumb son of a bitch? She's the only
one of us that can track animals.

17:57.015 --> 17:58.861
You get Ethel back and find Malloy!

17:58.986 --> 18:00.007
I'm not getting her back.

18:00.265 --> 18:03.650
I'm the one that got her fir-got-
I just said good-bye to her.

18:03.775 --> 18:06.779
Oh, yeah? Well, you get her back
or you're fired.

18:07.364 --> 18:10.802
- And you can say good-bye to this.
- That's not fair!

18:10.927 --> 18:12.712
Well, neither is male breast cancer.

18:17.168 --> 18:18.346
Man, this is awesome.

18:18.760 --> 18:20.669
Listen, I'm sorry
I assumed you were a rapist.

18:20.794 --> 18:22.103
No problem.

18:22.228 --> 18:23.757
Boy, I am stuffed.

18:24.017 --> 18:25.132
You'bout to be.

18:28.955 --> 18:31.565
- I can't let you do that, Ethel.
- What the hell are you doing here, Steve?

18:31.690 --> 18:33.762
We need you at the park.
Malloy is missing.

18:33.887 --> 18:34.859
I don't work there anymore.

18:35.432 --> 18:36.832
And I think that I've earned this.

18:38.583 --> 18:39.948
Jesus Christ!

18:40.073 --> 18:41.845
The truth is I need you, Ethel.

18:42.299 --> 18:43.498
I can't do this without you.

18:43.623 --> 18:46.064
- You [bleep] shot me!
- And this is hard to admit,

18:46.573 --> 18:48.228
But you're twice the ranger that I am.

18:48.353 --> 18:50.631
I feel really cold and
lightheaded right now.

18:50.858 --> 18:52.986
You just love talking about
yourself, don't you?

18:53.111 --> 18:55.439
"Cold and lightheaded."
You're not even listening to me!

18:55.869 --> 18:57.365
Come on! Get in the car.

19:19.742 --> 19:21.015
The footprints end here.

19:21.273 --> 19:23.066
Oh, well, that sucks.
Gave it our best shot.

19:23.427 --> 19:25.581
That means he must be inside,
you idiot. Come on.

19:28.817 --> 19:29.485
Malloy!

19:29.740 --> 19:32.541
- Oh, thank god you're all right.
- Do I look all right?

19:32.938 --> 19:33.861
Because of if I do,

19:33.986 --> 19:36.312
that means you didn't notice
there's a man inside of me.

19:36.437 --> 19:39.271
Holy shit, more company!
Come on in, y'all.

19:39.396 --> 19:42.389
- I got plenty of chocolate.
- You are in big trouble, buddy.

19:42.685 --> 19:45.560
You're gonna spend the next 3 days
picking up litter.

19:45.685 --> 19:47.342
- That's it?
- Yeah.

19:47.866 --> 19:49.967
Same-sex bear molestation is just
a misdemeanor.

19:58.393 --> 20:00.685
I'm so glad everything
turned out okay.

20:00.987 --> 20:03.979
No, everything turned out fine.
Except for the part where I was raped.

20:04.104 --> 20:06.096
Well, Ethel, looks like
you get your job back.

20:06.221 --> 20:08.264
Who gives a shit? I got raped.

20:08.614 --> 20:11.712
Uh-uh. Steve, I guess you deserve
to keep this for a while.

20:12.121 --> 20:13.044
You know what?

20:13.903 --> 20:15.908
I think it's time for a change.

20:16.831 --> 20:18.454
Looks even better on this side.

20:18.724 --> 20:22.026
- It's like a whole different shirt now.
- You're an asshole, you know that?

20:23.076 --> 20:25.272
She thinks I'm an asshole now.

20:25.397 --> 20:27.506
She doesn't even know that
I spiked her coffee.

20:27.888 --> 20:30.561
Good think I'll never tell a soul. It...

20:30.975 --> 20:33.108
Wait a minute.
Am I thinking this or saying this?

20:34.095 --> 20:36.355
- You spiked my coffee?
- Oops.

20:36.737 --> 20:40.079
Only you can prevent big vats of acid.

20:47.320 --> 20:48.497
I [bleep] love it.
