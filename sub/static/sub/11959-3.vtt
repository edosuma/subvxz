WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:03.999
Did you try to stall them?

00:04.000 --> 00:05.130
Write to Lorraine,

00:05.140 --> 00:08.090
tell my brother-in-law that these
letters will reach our friends.

00:08.115 --> 00:10.878
And have my courier meet me
at the tavern in Paris.

00:11.608 --> 00:13.356
Go, you idiot. Run.

00:24.243 --> 00:26.243
You are a heavy sleeper, monsieur.

00:26.253 --> 00:28.546
How dare you wake me
in the middle of the night?

00:28.571 --> 00:30.172
The King wants to see you.

00:41.363 --> 00:43.223
Am I in trouble?

00:43.233 --> 00:46.423
All we know is we must get you
to the palace without delay.

00:47.183 --> 00:49.343
- Why such urgency?
- Pull up your hood.

01:01.963 --> 01:03.565
Come on, Christophe.

01:06.273 --> 01:08.233
Josephine said it would be all right.

01:08.243 --> 01:10.203
My wife has a good heart.

01:10.213 --> 01:13.668
Sylvie and her friends
just need a small place to meet in.

01:13.693 --> 01:15.593
Your friends are trouble.

01:49.183 --> 01:51.242
This man has fallen. He needs help.

01:51.243 --> 01:52.881
Get him a chair.

01:53.353 --> 01:56.611
That's it, man.
It's all right. It's all right.

01:57.393 --> 01:59.353
Oh, now, easy, easy.

02:03.213 --> 02:05.618
Would that Musketeer
be one of your friends?

02:06.419 --> 02:08.549
Easy does it. Right, that's okay.

02:09.758 --> 02:11.828
- Away from me.
- Have some wine.

02:11.853 --> 02:13.760
Have some wine.

02:24.343 --> 02:25.836
I've been robbed!

02:27.077 --> 02:28.077
Hey!

02:29.223 --> 02:30.352
Come here!

02:30.353 --> 02:31.383
Stop! Stop!

02:41.408 --> 02:42.578
You cannot kill me.

02:42.798 --> 02:44.518
I'm the Duke of Orleans.

02:44.598 --> 02:46.064
The King's brother.

03:36.526 --> 03:37.969
We're leaving now.

03:38.386 --> 03:39.883
We will come back.

03:41.506 --> 03:44.386
Athos is Captain of the Musketeers.

03:45.546 --> 03:47.396
He will keep his word.

03:59.376 --> 04:00.904
Lower your weapons, soldiers.

04:03.556 --> 04:05.376
Get him out of here.

04:06.099 --> 04:07.456
Go.

04:07.466 --> 04:08.496
Get out.

04:15.026 --> 04:16.524
I'm sorry.

04:29.566 --> 04:31.890
Philippe. Brother.

04:32.326 --> 04:33.780
Praise God.

04:35.206 --> 04:37.058
Oh, it's a family reunion, look.

04:37.795 --> 04:39.113
Gaston!

04:40.032 --> 04:42.831
Welcome, welcome, welcome.

04:43.240 --> 04:46.220
Barely five minutes in Paris

04:46.245 --> 04:48.516
and already three men are dead.

04:48.715 --> 04:49.735
Why are you here?

04:49.760 --> 04:51.899
This man is a murderer.

04:51.924 --> 04:54.969
This fool and his friends
dragged me from my bed

04:54.994 --> 04:57.761
at an ungodly hour
without ceremony or reason,

04:57.786 --> 05:00.235
said that the King has sent for me.

05:00.661 --> 05:01.691
The King.

05:03.564 --> 05:06.594
I fell from my horse
through near exhaustion.

05:06.604 --> 05:10.128
They forced me into that
tavern, where I'm attacked.

05:10.540 --> 05:11.580
Robbed.

05:12.464 --> 05:14.623
I feared for my very life.

05:14.886 --> 05:17.623
Three innocent bystanders
are dead because of you.

05:17.624 --> 05:20.533
You did nothing to protect me.

05:20.534 --> 05:22.483
And the King will hear of it.

05:22.484 --> 05:26.524
Let us see what he wants with you
first, shall we? Together. Come.

05:26.534 --> 05:28.634
The King placed the Duke in our custody.

05:29.024 --> 05:31.484
A decision he may live
to regret, don't you think?

05:31.584 --> 05:32.584
Come.

05:33.869 --> 05:36.503
I left a good, clean war for this?

05:40.604 --> 05:41.634
Hiya!

05:43.351 --> 05:44.654
This is madness!

05:44.664 --> 05:47.844
Why bring the Duke of Orleans
back after all this time?

05:48.305 --> 05:49.918
It's political insanity.

05:49.943 --> 05:51.573
I'm sure the King has his reasons.

05:51.574 --> 05:53.310
Yes, which I do not have to share.

05:53.335 --> 05:54.485
Hurry up!

05:54.750 --> 05:56.670
The Duke will be here soon!

05:57.178 --> 05:58.589
Need I remind Your Majesty,

05:58.614 --> 06:00.581
you exiled him
for plotting to overthrow you.

06:00.804 --> 06:01.792
Your own brother.

06:01.817 --> 06:04.770
Treville believes
that Gaston cannot be trusted.

06:05.474 --> 06:08.524
I can keep my own counsel on
who can and cannot be trusted.

06:28.514 --> 06:30.256
- Where are the Musketeers?
- No matter.

06:30.614 --> 06:32.504
Gaston is here now.

06:48.425 --> 06:49.576
Three years.

06:50.524 --> 06:52.454
What have you been doing in that time?

06:53.514 --> 06:56.196
Hoping for this day
above all others, Majesty.

06:57.494 --> 07:00.330
Just to stand
in your presence once more.

07:02.826 --> 07:06.270
Of course, I never dared believe
it would actually happen, but...

07:30.777 --> 07:32.817
Time to build bridges, brother.

07:39.654 --> 07:41.464
Did you know about this?

07:41.765 --> 07:43.209
No...

07:43.514 --> 07:45.140
But neither did you.

07:45.608 --> 07:48.134
Isn't that interesting? Hmm?

07:59.305 --> 08:02.245
Bravo, well done. Congratulations.

08:02.496 --> 08:04.558
What a performance, Gaston.

08:05.435 --> 08:07.505
But where are you now?

08:11.544 --> 08:15.054
This mask of innocence and civility

08:15.464 --> 08:17.117
does not fit you very well.

08:17.464 --> 08:19.030
- I don't understand.
- No?

08:20.514 --> 08:22.046
Of course you don't.

08:22.544 --> 08:26.573
It appears His Majesty intends
to keep you with us for a while.

08:26.889 --> 08:27.917
And why not?

08:28.274 --> 08:29.502
We are reunited.

08:30.863 --> 08:31.901
I hope so.

08:32.822 --> 08:34.712
But, if not,

08:35.604 --> 08:38.169
he will come to me. Hmm?

08:44.674 --> 08:46.594
Who robbed him?

08:46.715 --> 08:49.655
It was packed to the rafters,
it could have been one of many.

08:49.680 --> 08:51.593
He should have never have been
brought back in the first place.

08:51.594 --> 08:54.030
- Why didn't you inform me?
- You're not the Captain any more.

08:54.055 --> 08:55.684
If I were, I'd keep to the Garrison

08:55.709 --> 08:57.755
and not ride out with my men
at every opportunity.

08:57.780 --> 08:59.055
The King gave me a direct order.

08:59.080 --> 09:00.960
The King is not himself!

09:02.644 --> 09:07.524
You need to start thinking like a
leader, Athos, not just a soldier.

09:08.989 --> 09:11.326
And we must tell each other everything.

09:15.432 --> 09:18.452
This inn, the men were all war veterans.

09:19.043 --> 09:20.720
They'll want justice.

09:23.097 --> 09:26.097
I cannot comprehend the
King's behaviour these days.

09:27.293 --> 09:29.235
But I'll try to reason with him.

09:44.460 --> 09:45.480
Stop!

09:48.847 --> 09:49.877
Here.

09:49.902 --> 09:51.854
Leave yourself open
like that and you're dead.

09:51.879 --> 09:53.634
This is not a game, do you understand?

09:53.644 --> 09:55.534
Do you understand?

09:57.445 --> 10:00.406
Head over heart, every time. All right?

10:01.554 --> 10:03.664
Good. Good?

10:03.674 --> 10:05.366
Again!

10:18.017 --> 10:20.064
What is your business here?

10:20.594 --> 10:22.150
What is yours, Captain?

10:23.428 --> 10:25.400
My quarters are not your domain.

10:26.337 --> 10:28.417
You will leave this instant.

10:28.544 --> 10:31.135
- But, Your Majesty, Governor Feron...
- Quiet!

10:31.160 --> 10:32.836
I did not give you permission to speak.

10:34.200 --> 10:36.350
I am no fool, Marcheaux.

10:36.634 --> 10:38.279
I know that you spy on me.

10:38.826 --> 10:41.146
And if I see you here again,
I will have you arrested.

10:46.154 --> 10:47.574
Your Majesty.

10:54.220 --> 10:56.351
Never seen you
in such a rage, Your Majesty.

10:56.376 --> 10:58.250
You've barely seen me at all.

10:59.086 --> 11:00.787
The garrison keeps me so busy.

11:00.812 --> 11:03.094
Forgive me, of course it does.

11:03.237 --> 11:04.367
It's just...

11:06.981 --> 11:09.504
I had few friends
before Gaston's arrival.

11:09.910 --> 11:11.262
Soon I'll have none.

11:11.613 --> 11:14.540
You'll always have me. And Treville.

11:15.998 --> 11:17.707
And my Musketeers.

11:21.105 --> 11:22.574
I'm glad they're back.

11:24.118 --> 11:25.353
For your sake.

11:26.311 --> 11:27.798
And d'Artagnan's.

11:30.095 --> 11:32.931
When will the garrison be
blessed with its first child?

11:36.322 --> 11:38.342
I'm not sure it ever will.

11:40.584 --> 11:41.614
Why?

11:44.554 --> 11:48.309
I see babies going hungry.

11:48.911 --> 11:52.168
I tell mothers their husbands
aren't coming home from the war.

11:54.749 --> 11:56.759
It's one thing to be a Musketeer's wife,

11:56.784 --> 11:59.834
I don't know if I'm brave enough
to be a Musketeer's widow.

12:03.523 --> 12:07.504
And I know I don't want to
raise a Musketeer's orphan.

12:11.843 --> 12:13.207
Constance.

12:15.339 --> 12:17.723
I forget how protected
I am here in the Palace.

12:25.854 --> 12:28.549
If the Duke would just
apologise to these soldiers.

12:28.574 --> 12:29.643
Absolutely not.

12:29.668 --> 12:32.464
They're animals. Took my money.

12:32.474 --> 12:33.495
Quite right.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.995
It is the thief who caused
this tragedy in the first place.

12:36.020 --> 12:37.403
Root them out, Treville.

12:37.428 --> 12:38.559
Recover what was stolen.

12:38.584 --> 12:39.873
That won't be necessary.

12:39.898 --> 12:41.634
I'm afraid I must insist.

12:42.140 --> 12:44.889
- Majesty...
- Soldiers respect the chain of command,

12:44.914 --> 12:46.643
Treville, you know this.

12:46.644 --> 12:48.484
Show them a strong hand.

12:49.088 --> 12:50.108
Find the thief,

12:50.587 --> 12:51.737
and bring him before me.

13:00.132 --> 13:01.336
Did you see anything?

13:01.653 --> 13:04.237
I saw an aristocrat
murder three innocent men

13:04.247 --> 13:05.456
while the four of you just stood by.

13:05.481 --> 13:07.771
- That isn't the question.
- That's the only question.

13:09.695 --> 13:11.795
What were you doing
with a group of soldiers?

13:13.211 --> 13:14.221
I like soldiers.

13:15.427 --> 13:17.123
I see that you do.

13:17.148 --> 13:18.624
Aramis, now is not the time.

13:18.649 --> 13:20.277
We're just talking.

13:20.287 --> 13:22.417
Did you steal the Duke's purse?

13:25.544 --> 13:26.900
Three men are dead.

13:27.540 --> 13:29.703
And your only concern
is a murderer's money?

13:29.728 --> 13:30.870
We have orders from the King.

13:30.895 --> 13:32.126
Orders to do what?

14:15.138 --> 14:16.569
Terribly interesting.

14:17.044 --> 14:21.383
The King seems to have lost
all confidence in his wife.

14:22.195 --> 14:26.031
Rarely have I seen a marriage
with so little intimacy.

14:26.514 --> 14:27.898
So little life.

14:28.564 --> 14:32.484
She must have heard the rumours.

14:32.494 --> 14:36.474
The King is going to make Gaston
part of the Royal Council.

14:36.484 --> 14:39.464
She must feel terribly alone.

14:40.935 --> 14:43.217
What is Louis up to?

14:46.534 --> 14:47.990
My hands, Georges.

14:49.381 --> 14:50.534
They're numb.

14:50.544 --> 14:51.633
It will pass.

14:51.976 --> 14:54.856
Will it? Perhaps.

14:56.097 --> 14:58.160
I need your help, Feron, or I'm lost.

15:00.793 --> 15:04.880
My purse contained letters from
the Duke of Lorraine and I

15:05.630 --> 15:07.554
to our allies across France.

15:09.464 --> 15:11.613
This is the Gaston that I know.

15:11.614 --> 15:14.614
Tell me, these letters,

15:15.036 --> 15:17.824
I imagine they weren't
the cordial affairs

15:17.849 --> 15:20.459
in which you praised the King's virtues?

15:20.484 --> 15:23.658
Come on, tell me.

15:23.683 --> 15:27.183
What mischief
did you and Lorraine propose?

15:28.411 --> 15:30.491
Extortion? Theft?

15:33.444 --> 15:36.311
Surely not the raising of an army?

15:39.139 --> 15:41.045
I thought the King was my enemy.

15:41.990 --> 15:43.950
How was I to know
we'd be brothers again?

15:43.975 --> 15:47.584
Well, your reunion
is going to be short lived

15:48.078 --> 15:49.769
if he ever sees those letters.

15:49.794 --> 15:51.304
You must get them back.

15:52.415 --> 15:53.703
If you help me,

15:54.926 --> 15:56.584
I will be in your debt.

15:58.313 --> 16:00.105
You'd like that, wouldn't you, Philippe?

16:03.754 --> 16:05.598
You've come to make an arrest?

16:06.379 --> 16:09.624
The King leaves us
with no military pension.

16:10.051 --> 16:12.732
His brother murders our friends.

16:13.045 --> 16:14.092
And now this.

16:14.117 --> 16:17.117
You can't demand justice if you
won't deliver it yourselves.

16:17.537 --> 16:19.889
The men we bury tomorrow,

16:20.444 --> 16:22.484
they fought for the King with us,

16:22.494 --> 16:24.534
on the worst day of the war,

16:24.895 --> 16:26.278
a Burgundy.

16:28.403 --> 16:29.864
But later that same day,

16:30.278 --> 16:34.478
we learned His Majesty had been
buying thoroughbreds for his stables.

16:34.503 --> 16:37.747
The King is grateful for the
infantry's sacrifice at Burgundy.

16:46.246 --> 16:49.769
The thief betrayed us and our
friends, Leopold. Remember that.

16:52.038 --> 16:53.878
He's dead to me, Captain.

16:54.634 --> 16:56.564
You're giving in to them?

16:56.574 --> 16:58.464
Holding them to their word.

17:01.514 --> 17:02.937
I'll find the culprit,

17:03.424 --> 17:04.473
but in return,

17:05.454 --> 17:07.130
the King will put his brother on trial.

17:13.569 --> 17:15.679
"The King is grateful"?

17:15.704 --> 17:17.311
What else could I say?

17:18.154 --> 17:20.304
We both know
there will never be a trial.

17:27.186 --> 17:30.217
It seems our visit has stirred
the thief's conscience.

17:34.669 --> 17:37.629
They want to hand themselves over
to us after the funeral tomorrow.

17:37.639 --> 17:40.442
Along with the Duke's stolen documents.

17:40.980 --> 17:43.344
He didn't lose money, he was lying.

17:45.729 --> 17:47.619
I told you everything I remember.

17:49.692 --> 17:52.812
I couldn't see who took the purse and
I didn't get anywhere near the Duke.

17:54.330 --> 17:55.741
Who did?

17:56.344 --> 17:57.772
There were so many of them.

18:06.650 --> 18:08.540
Very well.

18:08.808 --> 18:11.808
Inform the Duke's allies
that all is well.

18:13.742 --> 18:15.652
And get out of my sight.

18:20.723 --> 18:22.812
Thank you, Lucien.

18:22.822 --> 18:24.843
The Cerberus is due any day.

18:25.374 --> 18:27.812
I'm negotiating with buyers
for our shipment.

18:27.822 --> 18:29.752
And you disturb me with this.

18:29.777 --> 18:33.029
Gaston's treachery
is of little interest to me.

18:34.292 --> 18:36.272
But his letters...

18:36.872 --> 18:38.782
His letters implicate

18:38.792 --> 18:42.826
a dozen supposedly
loyal nobles in a plot

18:44.037 --> 18:45.877
against the King.

18:46.702 --> 18:48.162
That's a list of names worth owning.

18:48.210 --> 18:50.215
Oh, you see the opportunity?

18:51.722 --> 18:54.652
If we can acquire them we'll
control far more than the Duke.

18:54.662 --> 18:58.349
I think I'll have Marcheaux
arrest everybody at the tavern.

18:58.374 --> 18:59.464
No.

18:59.782 --> 19:03.378
Do not confront them on their own
territory. These men are dangerous.

19:03.802 --> 19:05.672
And what do you suggest?

19:06.702 --> 19:08.702
Strike when they are weakest.

19:09.822 --> 19:11.752
Grief is a great distraction.

19:42.670 --> 19:44.770
Any idea who this thief could be?

19:44.812 --> 19:46.241
We'll know soon enough.

19:46.266 --> 19:48.662
Can we pay our respects first?

19:54.107 --> 19:55.536
"With the Lord at your back

19:57.231 --> 20:00.702
"you need not fear the
destruction that wastes at noon.

20:04.259 --> 20:05.558
"He will cover you

20:05.812 --> 20:07.214
"with his feathers

20:07.758 --> 20:09.201
"and under his wings

20:10.135 --> 20:11.763
"you will find refuge.

20:14.594 --> 20:16.624
"You will not fear the terror of night

20:17.739 --> 20:20.503
"nor the arrow that flies by day.

20:32.899 --> 20:34.243
"A thousand...

20:40.722 --> 20:42.206
"A thousand men..."

20:48.027 --> 20:50.380
A thousand men may fall at your side.

21:09.937 --> 21:11.082
Excuse me.

21:11.910 --> 21:13.035
That man.

21:13.575 --> 21:14.605
Who is he?

21:14.630 --> 21:15.680
Lucien Grimaud.

21:16.035 --> 21:17.924
He kindly met the cost of this service.

21:36.407 --> 21:38.871
"A thousand men may fall at your side.

21:39.293 --> 21:41.774
"Ten thousand at your right hand.

21:43.210 --> 21:44.907
"But none shall come near you.

21:45.687 --> 21:48.717
"Because you have
made the Lord your refuge,

21:49.851 --> 21:51.352
"and the most high,

21:52.561 --> 21:53.881
"your dwelling place."

21:56.103 --> 21:57.830
This is a house of God!

21:57.855 --> 22:01.206
These men are to be arrested by
order of the Duke of Orleans.

22:02.632 --> 22:04.366
You really have no shame, do you?

22:04.391 --> 22:07.581
The shame belongs to
whoever stole from the Duke.

22:07.872 --> 22:10.233
But since they will not come forward,

22:10.530 --> 22:12.583
we'll flog everyone to get the truth.

22:13.623 --> 22:15.099
It is Orleans who should be flogged!

22:15.124 --> 22:16.833
And his bastard brother.

22:20.115 --> 22:21.498
- Treason.
- Hold.

22:21.523 --> 22:22.663
- Hold!
- Get back!

22:22.695 --> 22:24.364
Calm down.

22:24.555 --> 22:26.465
- No, no, no, no!
- If we were armed...

22:26.490 --> 22:28.847
Don't give them a reason to fire. Don't.

22:28.872 --> 22:30.292
Enough!

22:34.862 --> 22:36.275
Withdraw, Captain.

22:39.747 --> 22:41.657
I am your Minister.

22:41.682 --> 22:43.782
And I order you. Withdraw.

23:06.812 --> 23:08.199
Christophe.

23:08.583 --> 23:10.613
- Christophe...
- Get your hands off me.

23:10.772 --> 23:13.543
You brought that monster into my
home, all this is your fault.

23:13.568 --> 23:15.254
These men are trying to help.

23:17.842 --> 23:19.742
I should never have listened to you.

23:19.752 --> 23:21.732
I should have killed them all
when I had the chance.

23:24.594 --> 23:27.422
Four of ours have been taken,
we march on the Palace,

23:28.028 --> 23:29.434
take one of theirs.

23:29.580 --> 23:30.649
Orleans!

23:31.109 --> 23:32.670
Return to the tavern for the weapons.

23:32.695 --> 23:33.954
Yeah!

23:34.842 --> 23:36.702
- We should go after them.
- No.

23:37.792 --> 23:39.004
Come with me.

23:42.912 --> 23:45.882
If it wasn't for that little wretch,

23:45.892 --> 23:47.467
I'd be next in line to the throne.

23:47.962 --> 23:51.251
Childhood, such a perilous time.

23:51.912 --> 23:54.368
So much tragedy can just

23:55.627 --> 23:56.704
occur.

23:58.902 --> 24:01.604
So far, the King has refused
to listen to me.

24:01.842 --> 24:03.510
If all of you bear witness,

24:03.535 --> 24:06.119
he will understand the
severity of this situation.

24:16.345 --> 24:18.325
Why is my son out here with you?

24:18.350 --> 24:19.775
Majesty.

24:20.967 --> 24:22.713
The King, he is asleep,

24:22.738 --> 24:26.970
but he wanted the Dauphin and his two
uncles to become the best of friends.

24:27.431 --> 24:30.157
And how can you be friends
when he is over there

24:30.348 --> 24:31.358
and you're here?

24:31.439 --> 24:33.399
Who are you to question us?

24:33.953 --> 24:35.892
She is our Queen, Gaston.

24:35.917 --> 24:39.198
And you'd do well to remember that you
have only just returned from exile.

24:39.223 --> 24:42.589
While you have gone
into a kind of exile, Majesty.

24:43.723 --> 24:46.833
It seems as if the King
cares for nothing but his son.

24:50.673 --> 24:53.876
My son and husband
share many enthusiasms.

24:54.449 --> 24:55.705
But when he's grown,

24:55.916 --> 24:58.345
he may not love
the same people as his father.

25:03.860 --> 25:04.870
Majesty.

25:08.429 --> 25:11.748
Treville and his Musketeers,
they stopped us.

25:13.409 --> 25:14.558
They've gone to the King.

25:14.949 --> 25:15.999
I must go, too.

25:16.024 --> 25:17.509
- I'll come with you.
- No.

25:17.519 --> 25:20.608
Show Her Majesty that you can
be friends with the Dauphin.

25:20.633 --> 25:23.185
And try not to frighten the boy.

25:27.529 --> 25:30.535
The Duke ordered the Red Guard
to attack that church.

25:30.560 --> 25:31.775
Did he have your authority?

25:31.800 --> 25:32.770
But he was robbed.

25:32.795 --> 25:35.332
Majesty, this is about more than money.

25:35.357 --> 25:38.487
Your own war heroes are arming
themselves to march on the Palace.

25:38.512 --> 25:40.562
Then we must slaughter them.

25:40.795 --> 25:44.715
There are men just like these
in every borough of Paris.

25:44.725 --> 25:47.472
What will they do when they hear how
the King treats their brothers?

25:47.497 --> 25:50.527
Majesty, this is a fire
that must never be lit.

25:50.785 --> 25:53.018
Force the Duke to show remorse.

25:53.043 --> 25:54.895
- Make a public apology.
- Enough.

25:54.905 --> 25:56.905
You do not tell me what to do, Treville.

25:57.149 --> 26:00.059
Now, get these Musketeers out
of my quarters immediately.

26:06.583 --> 26:07.919
Oh...

26:34.825 --> 26:38.883
When I returned to Paris, it felt like
four years had passed in a moment.

26:43.905 --> 26:45.805
And now, it feels like forever.

26:49.455 --> 26:50.505
He's big.

26:51.735 --> 26:53.193
He's grown so tall.

26:53.905 --> 26:55.591
Why are you here?

26:58.564 --> 27:00.654
To stand witness
against the Duke of Orleans.

27:02.805 --> 27:04.062
Then do so.

27:10.835 --> 27:12.191
Majesty.

27:19.875 --> 27:22.145
You'd have me give up my own brother!

27:22.514 --> 27:25.925
My first responsibility is to my family.
My legacy.

27:25.950 --> 27:29.515
There will be no legacy if any more
of these men die at your hands!

27:30.187 --> 27:32.319
If you will not hear me,
then dismiss me!

27:32.344 --> 27:34.030
You would abandon me again, Treville?

27:34.055 --> 27:36.585
Many people in Paris
think you have abandoned them.

27:36.610 --> 27:39.785
I have not abandoned anybody,
it is I who has been abandoned.

27:42.518 --> 27:45.198
I have the white plague, Treville.

27:50.544 --> 27:52.444
This is my last summer.

28:26.548 --> 28:29.578
I was nine years old when
my father was assassinated.

28:31.610 --> 28:34.208
I can scarcely recall
the sound of his voice.

28:36.208 --> 28:38.325
My son will be just six.

28:40.013 --> 28:43.779
I must spend every possible moment
with him or he will forget me.

28:45.883 --> 28:47.883
The Queen would never
allow that to happen.

28:49.790 --> 28:51.680
Gaston is my blood.

28:52.700 --> 28:55.379
He will take his place
by the Dauphin's side.

28:56.016 --> 28:59.016
Make sure the child remembers
his heritage and his father.

29:00.372 --> 29:01.788
That's why you brought him back.

29:08.005 --> 29:10.177
Half of Paris hates him already.

29:10.202 --> 29:12.211
The other half will soon follow.

29:12.413 --> 29:15.393
Make a gesture
to keep the peace, Treville.

29:17.114 --> 29:22.164
Gaston must never bow down to a mob,
he must stay strong for my son.

29:24.144 --> 29:25.568
And the Queen?

29:36.648 --> 29:39.184
You are a dear friend, Treville.

29:40.848 --> 29:43.968
But if you say anything to her
or anyone else,

29:45.423 --> 29:48.413
I will hang you
without a moment's hesitation.

29:52.473 --> 29:55.433
Now, stop this from becoming
any more of a disaster.

29:57.433 --> 29:59.583
I'm going to spend time with my son.

30:32.983 --> 30:35.833
The King wants me to speak
to these men on his behalf.

30:37.194 --> 30:38.358
That's not a good idea.

30:38.383 --> 30:39.202
They blame us, Treville...

30:39.226 --> 30:41.436
I have to contain this before it spreads.

30:45.214 --> 30:47.580
I will speak to them
as a soldier, not a Minister.

30:47.605 --> 30:48.698
What's happened?

30:49.673 --> 30:52.673
They saw us help them against
the Red Guard, they'll listen to me.

30:52.698 --> 30:54.258
You're going alone?

30:54.423 --> 30:56.443
If I go with you, it will provoke them.

30:56.453 --> 30:58.443
Go without us, they might kill you.

30:58.453 --> 31:00.881
If they reach the Palace,
we'll kill all of them.

31:00.906 --> 31:03.129
I cannot risk any more blood
on Royal hands.

31:03.154 --> 31:04.436
I'm coming with you.

31:11.443 --> 31:13.503
I thought we were
telling each other everything.

31:47.758 --> 31:49.234
You shouldn't have come here.

32:00.101 --> 32:03.061
No! Christophe! Don't do this.

32:03.528 --> 32:06.015
Minister Treville
is the King's closest advisor.

32:06.186 --> 32:07.396
His friend.

32:08.007 --> 32:09.967
He's come to negotiate,
you can trust him.

32:11.892 --> 32:13.296
I was a soldier.

32:13.619 --> 32:14.639
Like all of you.

32:14.664 --> 32:16.087
A long time ago.

32:17.705 --> 32:18.767
Listen,

32:19.275 --> 32:21.537
the King regrets all that's happened.

32:22.186 --> 32:23.779
He'll grant compensation.

32:24.669 --> 32:26.552
We want much more than money now.

32:26.732 --> 32:28.394
And we don't need you to get it.

32:28.419 --> 32:30.654
The Palace guards know you're coming.

32:30.787 --> 32:32.406
It's a suicide mission.

32:33.151 --> 32:35.081
They have 10 times your number.

32:35.106 --> 32:37.116
They'll wipe you out within 100 paces.

32:40.030 --> 32:42.622
- Just cut their throats.
- This is not what you do.

32:42.647 --> 32:44.537
You've never seen me in war.

32:44.562 --> 32:46.014
You have no idea what I can do.

32:46.039 --> 32:47.944
You cannot win. Christophe...

32:47.969 --> 32:50.905
If we stand down now, no one
will ever know what happened.

32:50.930 --> 32:52.031
But we will know.

32:52.056 --> 32:53.667
That's not enough, Josephine!

32:54.028 --> 32:55.028
Not any more.

32:56.958 --> 32:59.875
Too many of our men lie
in unmarked graves,

33:00.078 --> 33:02.290
or live impoverished on these streets.

33:04.004 --> 33:05.110
We fought.

33:05.563 --> 33:06.790
We bled.

33:07.048 --> 33:09.783
We died for this King.

33:12.518 --> 33:13.790
Don't throw your lives away.

33:22.601 --> 33:23.701
One hundred paces?

33:29.078 --> 33:30.219
Tell me.

33:31.916 --> 33:33.352
What would the King give

33:35.407 --> 33:36.829
to get his friend back?

33:41.480 --> 33:44.189
Tie them, tight.

33:45.360 --> 33:47.774
- The Palace.
- We're not going to the Palace.

33:48.554 --> 33:50.180
They will come to us.

33:58.377 --> 33:59.915
All here.

34:00.460 --> 34:02.523
Get word to the Musketeers Garrison.

34:02.548 --> 34:03.776
Tell them we have the Minister.

34:04.340 --> 34:06.112
How is this going to end?

34:06.253 --> 34:07.950
When I finally get my hands on him.

34:07.975 --> 34:10.572
The death of the thief
who took the Duke's purse.

34:24.667 --> 34:26.677
Where's the Minister and my Musketeer?

34:30.726 --> 34:33.766
You won't see them until you've
taken our demands to the King.

34:35.025 --> 34:36.306
This is never going to happen.

34:36.340 --> 34:37.760
It'll happen in one hour.

34:38.350 --> 34:40.350
- Or your friends die.
- Stand down.

34:40.360 --> 34:41.907
We can still end this peacefully.

34:41.931 --> 34:43.952
This will end!

34:47.295 --> 34:49.130
But whether or not it is peaceful?

34:50.177 --> 34:51.661
That's up to you.

34:53.654 --> 34:55.014
One hour.

34:55.764 --> 34:57.092
You stay here.

35:02.661 --> 35:05.790
If we granted even half of what
they're asking for it would ruin us!

35:06.049 --> 35:07.674
A mass?

35:08.414 --> 35:10.351
Full pensions for thousands
of injured soldiers

35:10.375 --> 35:11.765
who can't even work let alone fight?

35:11.766 --> 35:14.390
Majesty, they were injured
fighting for you.

35:14.415 --> 35:16.465
They want me to go down there.

35:16.505 --> 35:19.283
- Impossible.
- Your return has caused chaos.

35:19.697 --> 35:22.110
Men are dead, the King's
reputation has been tarnished...

35:22.135 --> 35:24.330
- I am an innocent victim.
- Innocent?

35:24.340 --> 35:25.689
Stop! Both of you.

35:26.410 --> 35:28.125
Give the word, Majesty.

35:28.938 --> 35:31.499
The Red Guard will
raze the tavern to the ground

35:31.524 --> 35:34.055
and destroy every one of those traitors.

35:34.080 --> 35:36.200
Porthos and Treville will be killed.

35:37.048 --> 35:41.330
A strong possibility that I will do
everything in my power to prevent.

35:43.994 --> 35:46.034
We're running out of time, Majesty.

35:46.292 --> 35:48.380
Give me control of this situation.

35:48.390 --> 35:50.673
You cannot risk Treville's life.

35:50.698 --> 35:52.167
He is your friend.

35:52.192 --> 35:54.499
Do not make me go down there, Majesty.

35:54.854 --> 35:56.530
They'll tear me apart.

36:04.291 --> 36:05.421
Good.

36:06.143 --> 36:07.514
It's settled then.

36:08.539 --> 36:11.579
The Red Guard will attack the barricade,

36:12.101 --> 36:15.013
and we'll end this outrage
as swiftly as it began.

36:15.038 --> 36:16.510
Before we resort to that,

36:17.078 --> 36:18.862
I'd like permission to attempt a rescue.

36:21.175 --> 36:23.925
And if your rescue plan fails, Captain?

36:24.163 --> 36:25.936
You attack them
with everything you have.

36:28.138 --> 36:29.772
But try to save Treville.

36:46.689 --> 36:48.178
What does the king intend?

36:50.306 --> 36:52.319
He has agreed to a rescue attempt.

36:52.756 --> 36:55.013
He'll do everything in his
power to protect the Duke.

36:55.280 --> 36:56.528
Good.

36:57.786 --> 36:59.879
The Governor says
that the only way to make sure

36:59.904 --> 37:01.583
that those letters are never found,

37:02.660 --> 37:04.333
is to destroy those men.

37:06.228 --> 37:07.821
Then why are they still breathing?

37:09.345 --> 37:11.518
Red Guard are only authorised to attack

37:11.519 --> 37:13.539
if the Musketeers' rescue fails.

37:15.539 --> 37:16.628
It will fail.

37:16.964 --> 37:18.347
I'll see to that.

37:18.372 --> 37:19.529
There'll be a signal.

37:19.785 --> 37:22.058
Don't attack until you hear it.

37:30.127 --> 37:31.213
Stay calm.

37:31.768 --> 37:35.459
Make sure they can see us at all times.
No sudden movements.

37:36.765 --> 37:38.805
What are you doing? Lower your pistol.

37:40.975 --> 37:42.278
No one is to draw a weapon

37:42.302 --> 37:43.958
- without my order.
- Sorry, sir.

37:54.599 --> 37:56.509
Look to your left,

37:58.330 --> 37:59.400
now your right...

38:01.479 --> 38:03.499
A Musketeer is never alone, Brujon.

38:03.972 --> 38:05.327
Remember that.

38:15.853 --> 38:17.803
The Duke won't come.

38:19.439 --> 38:20.489
Maybe not.

38:22.264 --> 38:23.629
Aristocrats.

38:23.928 --> 38:26.006
Always stand at the edge of battle

38:26.031 --> 38:28.010
watching better men
lay down their lives.

38:28.035 --> 38:29.477
Hmm, yeah...

38:30.459 --> 38:32.274
Yeah, but this isn't what it is, is it?

38:32.741 --> 38:33.741
A battle.

38:35.263 --> 38:37.283
Men like us know the difference.

38:37.308 --> 38:39.268
A fight is all we've got left.

38:40.058 --> 38:41.815
- Let Porthos go.
- No.

38:42.854 --> 38:44.529
I never walk away from a fight.

38:46.839 --> 38:49.508
This is not how
you change things, Christophe.

38:53.588 --> 38:55.127
You both know,

38:55.651 --> 38:57.721
the enemy never gives you victory.

38:58.299 --> 38:59.557
You have to take it from them.

38:59.582 --> 39:01.572
We're not your enemy.

39:07.539 --> 39:09.113
If I untie you,

39:09.798 --> 39:11.708
put a weapon in your hands,

39:12.675 --> 39:14.128
will you join us?

39:20.227 --> 39:21.609
That's what I thought.

39:30.599 --> 39:32.394
You know they're right.

39:33.120 --> 39:35.167
They're just trying to
talk their way out of this.

39:35.347 --> 39:36.471
I don't believe you'd kill them.

39:36.768 --> 39:38.205
Not in cold blood.

39:38.711 --> 39:40.158
You're a good man.

39:41.066 --> 39:42.557
"A good man?"

39:44.549 --> 39:46.896
I am a man of my word.

39:47.489 --> 39:49.882
And if our own demands
are not met within one hour,

39:49.907 --> 39:51.787
I will shoot them both.

39:52.590 --> 39:54.083
Believe that.

40:00.430 --> 40:02.782
I need to know
our men are alive, Christophe.

40:16.932 --> 40:19.569
On your feet. Outside.

40:23.680 --> 40:25.081
Make it quick, Captain.

40:29.126 --> 40:30.126
Treville?

40:33.519 --> 40:37.579
As soon as I give the word, the King will
organise an emergency council meeting.

40:38.782 --> 40:40.672
It'll be over soon, my friend.

40:41.212 --> 40:42.332
Until then,

40:42.678 --> 40:45.328
be strong as you were at Alsace.

40:50.344 --> 40:51.720
Tell the King they're alive.

40:56.977 --> 40:58.619
Put the prisoners in the windows.

41:17.294 --> 41:18.324
Good.

41:19.449 --> 41:21.318
Porthos knows. They're ready.

41:24.397 --> 41:26.083
What happened at Alsace?

41:30.489 --> 41:33.797
Porthos got himself captured
by the Spanish regiment.

41:35.509 --> 41:36.842
We had to get him out.

41:36.867 --> 41:40.086
So, we came in through the
tunnels right underneath.

41:41.979 --> 41:43.448
Resourceful.

41:43.794 --> 41:45.144
Reckless.

41:54.958 --> 41:55.978
Ready?

41:56.268 --> 41:57.258
Ready.

42:14.479 --> 42:16.559
Stand by, Brujon. It's time.

42:27.549 --> 42:28.619
I knew it.

42:29.619 --> 42:31.529
Return fire!

42:35.631 --> 42:37.540
They need to work on their shooting.

42:38.834 --> 42:40.644
Now!

43:04.489 --> 43:05.599
Still got it, I see?

43:06.529 --> 43:07.781
Most of it.

43:11.529 --> 43:13.559
Let's see what those
Musketeers are made of.

43:31.701 --> 43:33.201
That's the signal.

43:46.599 --> 43:49.519
I see now that the King
will give us nothing.

43:51.110 --> 43:52.569
Christophe.

44:02.044 --> 44:03.094
No!

44:05.387 --> 44:07.257
Defend yourselves!

44:12.712 --> 44:14.502
Argh!

44:21.749 --> 44:23.081
Oh, no!

44:29.385 --> 44:32.033
- Let us help them.
- Without us they'll be slaughtered.

44:34.883 --> 44:36.329
Go! Go!

44:37.384 --> 44:38.494
Covering fire!

44:38.504 --> 44:41.454
Move, move, move! Fall back! Fall back!

44:45.068 --> 44:46.798
Come here. Come here.

44:55.408 --> 44:57.769
Head down! Go! Come on!

44:59.298 --> 45:01.511
Come on, come on, come on!

45:05.155 --> 45:06.234
Marcheaux!

45:06.259 --> 45:07.801
He won't listen!

45:08.278 --> 45:10.278
- This attack has no legitimacy!
- Remember!

45:10.288 --> 45:12.247
He has direct orders from the King.

45:12.288 --> 45:14.308
He will kill us all, no questions asked.

45:16.182 --> 45:17.677
We fight him.

45:18.641 --> 45:19.641
Together.

45:21.028 --> 45:22.258
Together.

45:22.268 --> 45:23.758
How much gun powder do you have?

45:23.783 --> 45:25.763
- Two barrels inside.
- I'll go.

45:37.039 --> 45:38.929
I should be the one in my grave.

45:40.539 --> 45:42.004
This is my fault.

45:47.848 --> 45:49.254
You're the thief?

45:50.268 --> 45:52.963
Christophe believes
this place pays for itself.

45:54.303 --> 45:55.403
It never has.

45:56.288 --> 45:58.118
Ever since he was discharged,

45:58.143 --> 45:59.516
the only way to keep
debtors at bay is to...

45:59.541 --> 46:01.238
Pick pockets of men like Gaston.

46:03.615 --> 46:06.505
Only this time there was
no money, just letters.

46:07.710 --> 46:09.752
I meant to give you them
after the funeral.

46:12.809 --> 46:14.869
These could bring Orleans down
once and for all.

46:16.939 --> 46:19.338
If Christophe finds out what
I've been doing all this time,

46:19.348 --> 46:20.747
it'll destroy him.

46:22.238 --> 46:24.067
Yes, well, we may be dead before then.

46:28.365 --> 46:29.947
Keep them firing!

46:33.597 --> 46:34.597
Now!

46:46.732 --> 46:48.250
They're reloading.

46:48.275 --> 46:49.623
- Now!
- Fire!

46:57.398 --> 46:58.869
Powder!

47:00.117 --> 47:01.438
I'm out!

47:01.836 --> 47:03.408
Fire!

47:10.592 --> 47:12.422
We're outgunned!

47:14.833 --> 47:17.075
Is there another way out?

47:17.616 --> 47:18.804
We're trapped.

47:23.228 --> 47:26.228
Whatever happens, I've got your back.

47:26.438 --> 47:28.393
I know.

47:48.418 --> 47:50.278
Draw swords!

48:33.743 --> 48:36.375
You are interfering
with the King's orders.

48:36.400 --> 48:39.338
A coward hides behind his orders.

48:39.348 --> 48:41.772
A man steps out in front of them.

48:43.555 --> 48:45.555
You are no man, are you?

48:50.388 --> 48:52.268
Round them all up.

49:13.288 --> 49:15.247
As you can see, Captain,

49:15.248 --> 49:16.490
I am safe now.

49:17.529 --> 49:19.278
Minister, I am relieved.

49:21.308 --> 49:23.298
Crawl back to the Governor.

49:47.699 --> 49:49.270
Josephine!

50:03.378 --> 50:04.418
You're cold.

50:10.303 --> 50:14.349
I always thought I would be the
one left alone in the world.

50:17.541 --> 50:20.073
I'm so sorry, Christophe.

50:24.228 --> 50:27.348
You have no reason to be sorry, my love.

50:30.617 --> 50:32.537
You stood by me.

50:33.318 --> 50:34.704
All these years.

50:35.688 --> 50:38.238
Through all those wars.

50:40.680 --> 50:42.398
I let you down.

50:42.844 --> 50:44.328
I...

50:44.580 --> 50:46.610
You fought bravely, Josephine.

50:49.662 --> 50:51.612
You kept your honour.

50:55.258 --> 50:56.475
You both did.

51:36.316 --> 51:38.715
The Duke was carrying
these when he entered the tavern.

51:38.935 --> 51:42.328
He and many others were
raising an army against you.

51:42.478 --> 51:44.448
If you won't punish him
for what he did to those men,

51:44.473 --> 51:46.278
surely you'll punish him for this.

51:46.288 --> 51:49.872
It is the soldiers who ought to be brought
to justice, rising up in such a way.

51:50.258 --> 51:52.398
This city is full of soldiers.

51:52.763 --> 51:53.965
Take against them,

51:53.990 --> 51:57.447
and next time it won't be
20 men who rise up, but 200.

51:57.909 --> 51:59.260
Then one thousand.

52:00.907 --> 52:02.907
Very well, the soldiers
will not be punished.

52:04.388 --> 52:06.308
Gaston acted out of fear.

52:07.368 --> 52:09.248
It's still a treason.

52:09.835 --> 52:11.735
And he is still my brother.

52:13.248 --> 52:15.238
Surely you're not going to forgive him?

52:23.482 --> 52:24.731
I'm returning to exile?

52:24.756 --> 52:26.895
No. No, you'll be staying here in Paris.

52:26.920 --> 52:28.760
But not here at the palace.

52:30.759 --> 52:31.879
The Bastille.

52:31.904 --> 52:33.801
By order of Governor Feron.

52:49.308 --> 52:50.881
Who do you think she's come to see?

52:51.448 --> 52:53.308
Athos.

53:04.398 --> 53:06.338
Strange choice, though.

53:11.058 --> 53:12.368
Thank you.

53:12.901 --> 53:14.402
Thank you.

53:15.358 --> 53:17.780
I told Christophe you could be trusted.

53:18.155 --> 53:19.710
Took you long enough.

53:20.401 --> 53:21.780
You proved me right in the end.

53:22.228 --> 53:24.155
- You doubted me.
- Not for a second.

53:27.539 --> 53:29.469
Probably shouldn't kiss
a captain in front of his men.

53:29.494 --> 53:31.240
Hmm...

53:32.312 --> 53:34.919
Most of them are boys. Not even men.

54:04.619 --> 54:06.080
Get out, Feron.

54:06.408 --> 54:08.564
I have no need
of a bastard's friendship.

54:10.073 --> 54:11.745
Good morning, Gaston.

54:12.776 --> 54:16.095
I am the son of a King, just like you.

54:16.120 --> 54:18.070
You are frail. Weak.

54:18.925 --> 54:22.258
True, I also have no heart.

54:22.268 --> 54:24.228
Very dangerous combination.

54:24.238 --> 54:28.877
My dear Gaston, only a fool would mistake
physical infirmity for weakness.

54:28.902 --> 54:32.792
When I'm released, yours is
the first throat I'll cut.

54:36.648 --> 54:39.885
You are everything
I took you for, Gaston.

54:40.073 --> 54:42.433
And much, much, less.

54:42.917 --> 54:45.159
I'll leave you to reflect.

54:45.838 --> 54:47.423
Perhaps I'll name you.

54:48.190 --> 54:51.854
Tell the King how you were
only too keen to help me.

54:53.617 --> 54:56.940
And perhaps you will
suffocate in your sleep,

54:57.539 --> 54:59.449
choke on your breakfast,

54:59.474 --> 55:03.298
or bleed out cutting your finger on one
of those letters you love to write.

55:03.576 --> 55:05.622
The future has many
possibilities, Gaston.

55:05.647 --> 55:07.806
And all of them end in death.

55:10.749 --> 55:12.740
We should both take this time

55:13.663 --> 55:15.693
to consider that.
