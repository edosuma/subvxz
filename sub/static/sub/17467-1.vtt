a fudge brownie sundae special.

a little girl

a surprise?

no one wants dessert.

I got to study.Well, then take the car.

alone in the bathroom.

out what you like best about me.

10:11.349 --> 10:14.048
That ship has sailed.

10:15.658 --> 10:17.878
Bonnie, come on...[door slams shut]

10:19.444 --> 10:21.664
Guess I can check
my e-mails now.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.321
Hi. I'm Christy.

10:26.408 --> 10:27.801
I'm an alcoholic...

10:27.888 --> 10:29.541
and a Capricorn.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.239
ALL:
Hi, Christy.

10:31.326 --> 10:33.371
Hi. Hi.

10:35.547 --> 10:39.203
I've been sober
a little more than three years.

10:39.290 --> 10:42.946
Now I'm not addicted to anything
except yoga.

10:43.033 --> 10:46.341
But that's okay 'cause what kind
of trouble could I get into

10:46.428 --> 10:48.691
lying on the floor, all sweaty,

10:48.778 --> 10:51.694
pushing my body to its limits?

10:51.781 --> 10:53.348
[Christy giggles]

10:57.047 --> 10:59.963
I'm also stretching my mind.

11:00.050 --> 11:02.096
I've gone back to school.

11:02.183 --> 11:05.926
I'm pursuing a law degree,
which was scary at first

11:06.013 --> 11:08.406
'cause I'm usually
the oldest one in my class.

11:11.540 --> 11:15.936
But that doesn't stop
all those hot young college guys

11:16.023 --> 11:18.460
from, you know...

11:18.547 --> 11:20.680
copying off my homework.

11:26.773 --> 11:28.557
I love fighting with you.

11:28.644 --> 11:30.037
[laughs]

11:30.124 --> 11:32.169
I love making up.
Oh.

11:32.256 --> 11:34.389
Are we gonna
fight about this?

11:34.476 --> 11:36.652
'Cause I'm gonna need an
hour and some Gatorade.[laughs]

11:36.739 --> 11:38.175
Oh!

11:38.262 --> 11:40.438
I can't remember
the last time

11:40.525 --> 11:42.963
I felt this safe
in a relationship.
Mmm.

11:43.050 --> 11:45.095
I mean, growing up
in foster care,

11:45.182 --> 11:46.749
it's really hard
to trust people,

11:46.836 --> 11:49.317
but I trust you so much.

11:49.404 --> 11:51.798
[laughs]

11:54.409 --> 11:56.803
I'm gonna tell you a secret.

11:56.890 --> 12:00.328
Before I had Christy...

12:00.415 --> 12:03.113
Oh.

12:03.200 --> 12:07.074
I had this crazy idea
that I could become a singer.

12:08.945 --> 12:11.905
I mean, I'm not
talking rock star, but

12:11.992 --> 12:16.648
I pictured myself
in a club with a piano.

12:19.956 --> 12:25.527
♪ Some say love ♪

12:25.614 --> 12:31.925
♪ It is a river ♪

12:32.012 --> 12:33.753
♪ That drowns... ♪

12:35.145 --> 12:36.756
I am singing,
you son of a bitch!

12:38.105 --> 12:40.281
Ow.

12:43.414 --> 12:44.938
So, what did you think
of the meeting?

12:45.025 --> 12:46.504
I didn't hear a
word anybody said.

12:46.591 --> 12:48.158
I was too busy
being on my honeymoon

12:48.245 --> 12:49.725
with the guy in
the brown jacket.
Oh.

12:49.812 --> 12:52.336
Where'd you go?
Maui.

12:52.423 --> 12:54.686
The hotel gave us robes
with our names on 'em.

12:54.774 --> 12:57.385
Excuse me.
Christy, right?

12:57.472 --> 12:58.908
Oh, yeah. Hi.
Hi.

12:58.995 --> 13:00.867
I'm Derek. I just
wanted to tell you,

13:00.954 --> 13:03.695
I really enjoyed
your share.
Thanks.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.480
You know, I've been
thinking about going back

13:05.567 --> 13:07.917
to school myself, so I
found that really inspiring.

13:08.004 --> 13:10.833
I'm glad.
I'm Jill.

13:10.920 --> 13:12.400
Hi.

13:12.487 --> 13:15.055
Uh, so tell me why'd
you decide to study law?

13:15.142 --> 13:18.536
Well, before I got sober,
I frequently needed a lawyer,

13:18.623 --> 13:22.105
so I figured,
why not cut out the middleman.[laughter]

13:22.192 --> 13:25.761
Also, I wanted to do something
worthwhile, try to help people.

13:25.848 --> 13:27.154
Me, too. That's why

13:27.241 --> 13:29.591
I give my housekeeper Botox
every Christmas.

13:30.940 --> 13:33.551
Nobody likes
a wrinkly maid.

13:33.638 --> 13:36.250
I see. It's terrific.

13:36.337 --> 13:38.818
Uh, I've never seen you at
this meeting before, right?

13:38.905 --> 13:41.124
I usually go to meetings
closer to home.

13:41.211 --> 13:44.388
She lives in a nasty part
of town with her mom.

13:44.475 --> 13:46.434
Well, listen, uh,

13:46.521 --> 13:48.566
if you haven't already
had too much coffee,

13:48.653 --> 13:50.351
why don't we go...?Do you know the guy
in the brown jacket?

13:50.438 --> 13:52.396
Christy wants
to marry him.
Jill!

13:52.483 --> 13:54.659
Sorry, I don't.Hang on.

13:54.746 --> 13:57.575
What the hell is wrong
with you?!
What?!

13:57.662 --> 13:59.882
You're embarrassing me
in front of Eric.It's Derek.

13:59.969 --> 14:03.233
I said hang on! I thought
you were gonna help me.

14:03.320 --> 14:05.714
Well, I'm trying,
but now you're making a scene.

14:05.801 --> 14:08.325
You know what? Uh, I
actually have to go...

14:08.412 --> 14:12.068
call my sponsor.

14:12.155 --> 14:14.331
Thank you so very much.

14:14.418 --> 14:15.898
What is your problem?

14:15.985 --> 14:17.944
I was trying to get you
and Brown Jacket off to Maui.

14:18.031 --> 14:20.207
Forget Brown Jacket!
I had a shot at Eric.

14:20.294 --> 14:22.209
It's Derek.
I don't care!

14:22.296 --> 14:24.428
You totally torpedoed me!

14:24.515 --> 14:26.866
Why didn't you just tell him my
kids have two different dads?!

14:26.953 --> 14:29.216
Or that I was a stripper?!

14:30.782 --> 14:33.524
Oh, you are gonna
kick yourself in a minute.

14:36.310 --> 14:37.615
[TV plays quietly]

14:37.702 --> 14:39.487
Hey.

14:39.574 --> 14:41.881
Hey. How'd it go?[door closes]

14:41.968 --> 14:44.709
Jill vag-blocked me.

14:46.233 --> 14:47.451
Where's Adam?

14:47.538 --> 14:49.627
Adam's having a time out.

14:49.714 --> 14:51.891
ADAM:
Christy, she won't
give me back my chair!

14:54.894 --> 14:56.896
We may have hit a rough patch.

14:56.983 --> 14:58.854
So you took away his wheelchair?

14:58.941 --> 15:00.334
What are you doing?

15:00.421 --> 15:02.075
I'm helping the man
who can't walk.

15:02.162 --> 15:03.641
Oh, sure. Take his side.

15:03.728 --> 15:05.513
What if he has to pee?

15:05.600 --> 15:07.645
ADAM:
I do!

15:07.732 --> 15:09.430
Marjorie's right. You
need to go to a meeting.

15:09.517 --> 15:10.822
Oh, my God, enough
with the meetings!

15:10.910 --> 15:12.433
It's not always about a meeting!

15:12.520 --> 15:14.043
Sometimes it's about two people

15:14.130 --> 15:16.132
who clearly aren't meant
to be together!

15:16.219 --> 15:18.569
That man is impossible
to live with!

15:18.656 --> 15:21.007
He trims his nails, watches TV,

15:21.094 --> 15:23.052
he looks at his watch, sleeps!

15:23.139 --> 15:25.533
How am I supposed
to love someone like that?!

15:25.620 --> 15:28.057
Mom.
I know! I need a meeting!

15:28.144 --> 15:30.668
There's a late one at St. Pat's.
I'll drive.

15:30.755 --> 15:32.061
That's it.
I've had it.

15:32.148 --> 15:33.497
You're out of your
freakin' mind, okay?

15:33.584 --> 15:35.891
You're right. I know.
I am. I'm sorry.

15:35.978 --> 15:37.762
I love you. I'll see
you in an hour.

15:37.849 --> 15:39.329
Wait. What...?
What did she just...?

15:39.416 --> 15:41.549
What just happened?

15:41.636 --> 15:44.247
Don't worry. When she gets back,
she'll be a different person.

15:44.334 --> 15:47.294
She's been three different
people in the last hour!

15:55.998 --> 15:57.347
It's good to have you
back, Bonnie.It's good to be back.

15:57.434 --> 15:59.132
You know I find
with my Victor,

15:59.219 --> 16:01.569
the more meetings I go to,
the better our marriage.

16:01.656 --> 16:04.528
And I'm sure
he appreciates your absence.

16:04.615 --> 16:07.662
Good to have you back, Bonnie.

16:09.446 --> 16:12.014
You seem kind of quiet.
Everything okay?I'm fine.

16:12.101 --> 16:13.798
I'm fine, too.No one asked you.

16:13.885 --> 16:16.410
Hey, I went out of my
way to help you meet guys,

16:16.497 --> 16:17.846
and you were nothing
but ungrateful.

16:17.933 --> 16:19.456
You didn't help medo anything.

16:19.543 --> 16:22.024
You were jealous that Eric-Derek
liked me instead of you.

16:22.111 --> 16:23.417
Oh, get over yourself.

16:23.504 --> 16:24.984
Eric-Derek went
after the little mouse

16:25.071 --> 16:26.942
'cause he knew the big
mouse was out of his league.

16:27.029 --> 16:28.857
Don't tell me
what Eric-Derek was thinking.

16:28.944 --> 16:30.772
You don't know
what Eric-Derek was thinking.

16:30.859 --> 16:33.775
Now, come on, ladies.No, let 'em
punch themselves out.

16:33.862 --> 16:36.343
What kind of name
is Eric-Derek?

16:36.430 --> 16:38.127
Just face it--
you suck as a friend

16:38.214 --> 16:39.563
'cause you're threatened
by other women.

16:39.650 --> 16:41.217
I am not!

16:41.304 --> 16:42.305
Come on, ladies.

16:42.392 --> 16:45.091
Get my back here, right?

16:46.657 --> 16:48.485
See? They're with me.

16:50.226 --> 16:52.141
And you know what?
If I do have issues

16:52.228 --> 16:53.708
with women, it's not my fault.

16:53.795 --> 16:55.318
All my life,
they've let me down.

16:55.405 --> 16:57.277
Here we go.It's true.

16:57.364 --> 16:59.540
My mother killed herself
just when I needed her most.

16:59.627 --> 17:01.368
My therapist married my dad.

17:01.455 --> 17:04.719
And my housekeeper does a really
unflattering impression of me.

17:04.806 --> 17:06.068
What does that sound like?

17:06.155 --> 17:09.289
Me, but Southern and stupid.

17:09.376 --> 17:12.117
Excuse me,
but Inever let you down.

17:16.818 --> 17:19.212
You're right.

17:21.779 --> 17:24.781
You're right. I'm sorry
I let my ego get the best of me.

17:26.088 --> 17:27.523
But the thing is...

17:27.611 --> 17:29.744
Stop!

17:29.831 --> 17:32.399
Leave out the excuses
and just say you're sorry.

17:33.704 --> 17:36.185
I'm sorry.

17:36.272 --> 17:38.318
Okay.

17:38.405 --> 17:40.320
I forgive you.

17:40.407 --> 17:42.496
Thanks.

17:42.583 --> 17:44.019
Whenever you're ready.

17:45.760 --> 17:48.893
Oh, don't leave her the
check, honey. She's poor.

17:51.505 --> 17:55.204
Ugh. I just did it
again, didn't I?
