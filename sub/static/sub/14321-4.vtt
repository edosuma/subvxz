[theme music playing]

01:23.208 --> 01:24.250
[Proteus screaming]

01:24.875 --> 01:26.166
[Moira]
All these years.

01:26.875 --> 01:27.875
All the work.

01:29.875 --> 01:32.875
Now he'll be able
to control his powers

01:32.875 --> 01:34.833
and come out into the world!

01:34.833 --> 01:36.333
Thanks to you, Moira.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.291
I just wish the treatment
weren't so hard on him.

01:40.958 --> 01:42.000
-[beeping]
-[Proteus grunting]

01:42.583 --> 01:44.125
[Proteus]
It's hurting me!

01:44.125 --> 01:46.583
It's the only way, Kevin!

01:46.583 --> 01:48.458
You must both be strong!

01:51.208 --> 01:52.250
[groaning]

02:00.708 --> 02:02.208
[powering down]

02:02.208 --> 02:03.708
Look! Moira!

02:04.291 --> 02:05.291
I can see him!

02:05.750 --> 02:08.000
Kevin, I can see you!

02:08.500 --> 02:10.166
He's so close!

02:14.708 --> 02:16.875
[Banshee and Moira screaming]

02:23.583 --> 02:24.583
I...

02:25.458 --> 02:26.458
I'm...

02:27.708 --> 02:28.708
Kevin!

02:31.500 --> 02:32.625
What's happening?

02:37.416 --> 02:38.583
I don't know, Kevin.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.500
But the therapy is working.

02:41.125 --> 02:42.458
We'll start again!

02:42.458 --> 02:43.833
No!

02:43.833 --> 02:45.875
Let me see what's outside
these walls!

02:50.125 --> 02:51.875
[Banshee screaming]

02:58.291 --> 03:00.625
Please, Kevin, let Banshee go.

03:00.625 --> 03:01.875
Why?

03:01.875 --> 03:03.166
You might hurt him.

03:03.166 --> 03:04.750
I know you don't mean to.

03:05.458 --> 03:07.250
Let's go to the other chamber.

03:07.250 --> 03:08.458
[Banshee screaming]

03:13.416 --> 03:14.583

[Moira screaming]

03:27.708 --> 03:30.833
[Moira]
Charles!This is Moira!
Please, answer me!

03:30.833 --> 03:33.416
What is wrong
with the signal, Beast?

03:33.416 --> 03:34.875
I am not certain, Professor.

03:35.750 --> 03:39.000
-Charles, please answer me!
-What is it?

03:39.000 --> 03:41.458
Come quickly! I need your help!

03:41.458 --> 03:42.583
[Moira screaming]

03:42.583 --> 03:43.833
Moira!

03:43.833 --> 03:45.333
Beast, prepare the Blackbird.

03:59.375 --> 04:00.500
Come quickly!

04:00.500 --> 04:02.333
Looks like she saw a ghost!

04:02.333 --> 04:04.375
Big deal. So,

04:04.375 --> 04:06.125
we go stomp a ghost.

04:06.125 --> 04:08.125
It is a big deal, Logan.

04:08.125 --> 04:10.333
I've known Moira 20 years.

04:10.333 --> 04:12.291
I've never heard her like that.

04:18.500 --> 04:19.833
For me?

04:19.833 --> 04:21.291
Do you see any other

04:21.291 --> 04:22.583
beautiful women around?

04:27.625 --> 04:29.416
Oh, Charles!

04:30.250 --> 04:32.375
Yes, of course
I'll be your wife.

04:49.708 --> 04:52.875
[Moira]
Charles, I will always
care forryou.

04:53.416 --> 04:55.583
But I've fallen in love
with someone else.

04:56.125 --> 04:57.708
By the time you receive this,

04:57.708 --> 04:58.750
we will be married.

05:01.416 --> 05:02.875
I'm so very sorry.

05:28.458 --> 05:30.875
This isn't what I signed up for.

05:30.875 --> 05:34.291
Help us to fulfill my dream.

05:34.291 --> 05:37.166
Working for
a better future for all,

05:37.166 --> 05:38.708
mutant and human alike.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.958
[Moira]
So good to see you, Charles.

05:58.708 --> 06:00.875
I'd like you to meet
Sean Cassidy,

06:00.875 --> 06:01.875
my fiance.

06:02.708 --> 06:06.333
Moira's told me a great deal
about you, Mr. Xavier.

06:06.333 --> 06:09.250
How fortunate.

06:09.250 --> 06:12.291
Now if you'll show me
my quarters, Moira,
I need to rest.

06:16.958 --> 06:18.708
Does he not
still love you, Moira?

06:19.458 --> 06:20.833
I dinnae think so.

06:20.833 --> 06:21.958
But he needs me.

06:22.375 --> 06:25.000
Charles has given everything
for his students,

06:25.000 --> 06:26.291
his X-Men.

06:26.291 --> 06:29.166
But friends, aye,
that's different.

06:29.166 --> 06:32.000
Sometimes I think
I'm the only one he has.

06:35.958 --> 06:37.500
[Wolverine]
There's Muir Island.

06:37.500 --> 06:39.500
Yes. Take us in.

06:48.833 --> 06:50.583
Have a look
for yourself, Charles.

06:51.500 --> 06:54.500
This security tape
was taken during
the sonic therapy.

06:59.500 --> 07:01.375
What is happening here?

07:01.375 --> 07:03.291
He is possessing Banshee's body.

07:04.250 --> 07:05.708
Any lasting effects?

07:06.125 --> 07:07.875
Temporary weakness, exhaustion.

07:09.250 --> 07:10.875
[Rogue]
Who whacked the camera?

07:10.875 --> 07:13.583
Not the camera, Rogue,
the whole room.

07:13.583 --> 07:16.250
Proteus can actually
change the physical world
around him

07:16.250 --> 07:17.500
by merely thinking it.

07:18.458 --> 07:21.500
Notice that after he leaves,
the room goes back
to its normal state,

07:21.500 --> 07:24.000
though it does you no good
if you're hurt
while it's happening.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.333
And, Proteus is telepathic.

07:26.333 --> 07:28.416
A spectacular power.

07:28.416 --> 07:30.458
A teenager who can
quite literally

07:30.458 --> 07:32.000
do anything he wishes.

07:32.583 --> 07:33.958
Not a comforting thought.

07:33.958 --> 07:37.000
So he can turn things
upside down.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.958
He don't look
old enough to shave.

07:39.458 --> 07:42.875
Ah, Beast, take Rogue
and Wolverine in theeBlackbird

07:42.875 --> 07:44.458
and see if you can track him.

07:44.458 --> 07:46.291
Muir Island is not that large.

07:46.291 --> 07:48.000
Please, be careful.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.583
He's young and scared.

07:49.583 --> 07:52.250
And he has no idea
how powerful he is.

07:52.708 --> 07:54.583
Xavier's kind of out to lunch.

07:54.583 --> 07:57.583
They were engaged once,
Mr. Sensitive.

07:57.583 --> 07:59.291
-[Wolverine] So?
-[Rogue] So next time

07:59.291 --> 08:00.708
the love of your life's
in trouble,

08:00.708 --> 08:02.250
let me know
how well you function.

08:03.708 --> 08:04.750
Moira, I--

08:04.750 --> 08:06.250
[Moira]
Oh, Charles!

08:07.291 --> 08:09.708
My research began
with this mutant.

08:10.458 --> 08:11.708
I've failed him,

08:11.708 --> 08:13.375
and those he may harm.

08:14.250 --> 08:17.375
We will find him
and bring him back. Don't worry.

08:18.875 --> 08:20.166
Thank you, Charles.

08:20.166 --> 08:21.458
You were always good to me.

08:22.083 --> 08:24.458
I miss seeing you,
being so far away.

08:27.625 --> 08:29.625
What do you hear
from Joe these days?

08:30.583 --> 08:32.875
Joe is a big-time
politician now.

08:32.875 --> 08:34.375
Doing quite well without me.

08:37.375 --> 08:39.000
[chuckles]
Do you want to see?

08:39.833 --> 08:41.583
What Scotland has lost

08:41.583 --> 08:44.083
is its dedication
to family values.

08:44.458 --> 08:47.458
As Secretary of State,
I will bring Scotland back

08:47.458 --> 08:49.458
to the values
that made it great.

09:08.583 --> 09:10.875
[Kevin]
I've read about
places like this.

09:10.875 --> 09:12.458
All these people!

09:12.458 --> 09:14.583
The smells! The sounds!

09:15.375 --> 09:16.958
What do I do first?

09:16.958 --> 09:18.875
[mutants laughing]

09:23.000 --> 09:25.583
He's been isolated
at my hospital all his life.

09:25.583 --> 09:27.458
He knows nothing
of the outside world.

09:27.875 --> 09:29.708
He's 17, but immature.

09:29.708 --> 09:31.375
There are times
he acts like a child.

09:31.833 --> 09:34.375
He communicates
through his telepathy.

09:34.375 --> 09:36.583
I will try to reach him.

09:36.583 --> 09:38.125
[Moira]
Be careful, Charles!

09:40.125 --> 09:41.583
I am having to push

09:41.583 --> 09:44.291
through unusual psychic static.

09:45.750 --> 09:46.750
There!

09:47.375 --> 09:50.208
A confused, anxious mind.

09:51.500 --> 09:53.125
Barely touching it.

09:54.291 --> 09:56.208
I must try harder!

09:56.208 --> 09:57.208
[Kevin gasping]

09:59.500 --> 10:01.875
-[woman screaming]
-[Kevin]]What's going on?

10:01.875 --> 10:03.333
How did you do that?

10:08.291 --> 10:11.250
Whoever you are,
stay out of my mind!

10:11.250 --> 10:13.250
[Xavier struggling]

10:16.583 --> 10:18.500
He's... gone.

10:29.833 --> 10:31.708
[moaning]

10:34.291 --> 10:36.166
[Beast]
Professor, we found something!

10:36.583 --> 10:38.708
A worker was discovered
severely weakened,

10:38.708 --> 10:40.375
but otherwise unhurt.

10:40.375 --> 10:42.166
Not unlike Banshee.

10:42.166 --> 10:43.875
Did he say anything?

10:43.875 --> 10:47.416
Delirious ravings
about a big evil thing.

10:47.958 --> 10:49.708
Probably talking about Beast.

10:49.708 --> 10:52.750
Professor, it appears
Proteus has left the island.

10:53.875 --> 10:56.958
Charles! There are millions
of people over there!

10:56.958 --> 10:59.416
The last ferry has reached
the mainland by now.

11:00.083 --> 11:02.458
Off the island,
there's no telling
the harm he could do.

11:16.708 --> 11:18.708
[panting]

11:22.833 --> 11:24.125
[screaming]

11:24.125 --> 11:25.458
Looks like Ian boy

11:25.458 --> 11:27.166
ran out of places to hide.

11:28.875 --> 11:30.958
-What's that?
-Leave him alone!

11:32.583 --> 11:34.583
[men screaming]

11:49.875 --> 11:50.875
Come on!

11:55.708 --> 11:56.750
Don't!

11:58.875 --> 12:00.083
[Kevin]
They scared him.

12:01.583 --> 12:03.375
Why did they want to hurt him?

12:06.583 --> 12:07.583
Ian!

12:08.208 --> 12:09.250
Ian!

12:13.583 --> 12:16.000
Are you okay, son?
Who did this to you?

12:16.000 --> 12:18.458
Why does this man
hold him like this?

12:18.458 --> 12:20.333
This man wants to protect him.

12:21.250 --> 12:22.500
He loves him!

12:23.166 --> 12:24.583
He would do anything for him!

12:24.583 --> 12:26.333
Talk to me, son. What's wrong?

12:26.333 --> 12:29.416
He is his... father!

12:29.416 --> 12:31.708
His father, not mine!

12:31.708 --> 12:34.333
Get away from my boy,
you monster!

12:34.333 --> 12:37.000
-Why doeshe call me a monster?
-Help!!Help! Please!

12:37.000 --> 12:39.416
-Somebody help.
-I was just trying
to help his son.

12:39.875 --> 12:42.083
Where is my father?

12:42.083 --> 12:43.875
[men yelling]

12:45.708 --> 12:46.833
Go away!

12:49.708 --> 12:50.875
Don't do that!

12:55.625 --> 12:57.625
Mayday! Mayday!

12:58.875 --> 13:00.875
[men screaming]

13:04.333 --> 13:06.375
[Guard]
Mayday! Mayday!

13:06.375 --> 13:08.125
[Guard screaming]

13:08.125 --> 13:10.250
Sounds like we found our boy.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.458
You cannot hurt me!

13:18.458 --> 13:21.875
[Wolverine]
Wow, this kid sure knows
how to throw a block party.

13:21.875 --> 13:24.875
[Beast]
If Dr. MacTaggert is correct,
he must still be here,

13:25.333 --> 13:27.583
or his effect on the area
would have been reversed.

13:27.583 --> 13:29.833
What have I allowed to happen?

13:29.833 --> 13:31.875
Moira, please,
this is not your fault.

13:32.375 --> 13:34.000
Pick us up, Beast, right away.

13:36.583 --> 13:39.333
[people screaming]

13:53.375 --> 13:55.000
[Man 1]
Get out of here! Watch out!

13:58.875 --> 14:01.125
Where is my father?

14:11.250 --> 14:12.750
If I may ask,

14:13.250 --> 14:16.500
how do you propose
that we persuade Proteus
to return with us?

14:17.125 --> 14:18.583
I don't know.

14:18.583 --> 14:20.166
But we have to try.

14:21.291 --> 14:23.750
Proteus, you must stop.

14:23.750 --> 14:25.583
[Joe on tv:]
What Scotland has lost

14:25.583 --> 14:28.000
is its dedication
to family values.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.500
[Xavier]
Let me help you.

14:30.083 --> 14:31.583
[Kevin]
Who are you?

14:31.583 --> 14:33.291
I'm not hurting anyone!

14:33.708 --> 14:35.875
People are trying to harm me!

14:35.875 --> 14:39.416
Please, leave me... alone!

14:39.416 --> 14:40.833
-[groaning]
-Professor?

14:40.833 --> 14:41.833
[moaning]

14:43.583 --> 14:45.125
-Charles!
-Astounding!

14:46.333 --> 14:48.208
Professor, are you all right?

14:48.708 --> 14:50.250
Oh, Charles.

14:52.250 --> 14:53.625
Rogue! Wolverine!

14:56.583 --> 14:57.875
[Rogue]
What in the world?

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
[people muttering]

15:08.708 --> 15:09.750
Has it gone?

15:10.625 --> 15:12.583
[Man 2]
What's that? What is that?

15:12.583 --> 15:14.458
Wh... What's happening to me?

15:15.166 --> 15:18.125
[Kevin]
A lorry!
Now I can go anywhere.

15:18.125 --> 15:20.333
The one who tried to reach me
is with them.

15:20.875 --> 15:22.250
He is the one!

15:23.708 --> 15:25.500
[Wolverine]
Soccer match
get out of hand?

15:25.500 --> 15:27.000
[Man 3]
A monster did this!

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
A mutant for sure!

15:29.000 --> 15:30.958
[Kevin]
Why does he move about
in a chair?

15:32.125 --> 15:33.708
Is he somebody special?

15:34.583 --> 15:36.208
Hey! What are you doing?

15:36.833 --> 15:37.833
Let go!

15:38.708 --> 15:40.708
I can't control this!

15:40.708 --> 15:42.708
[people screaming]

15:50.500 --> 15:51.500
[Rogue moaning]

15:53.875 --> 15:55.208
I must find my father.

15:55.833 --> 15:57.000
He'll protect me from them!

16:00.250 --> 16:03.000
Got to be careful
picking dancing partners,
darling.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.166
The young ones
will wear you out.

16:04.583 --> 16:06.833
He's searching for someone.

16:06.833 --> 16:08.083
Who, Rogue?

16:08.083 --> 16:09.333
A man.

16:09.333 --> 16:12.375
An important man
to him.

16:12.375 --> 16:14.750
You know
this mutant's history, Moira.

16:14.750 --> 16:16.333
Who could this man be?

16:16.875 --> 16:18.958
I have no idea, Charles.

16:18.958 --> 16:20.333
Grab the plane.

16:20.333 --> 16:22.000
I'll track him on the ground.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.583
How hard could it be to find one
testosterone-driven kid?

16:25.583 --> 16:27.208
[lightning striking]

16:27.208 --> 16:28.291
Check that.

16:28.291 --> 16:30.583
[thunder rumbling]

16:36.000 --> 16:38.333
His path, though erratic,
indicates he intends

16:38.333 --> 16:39.833
to go to Edinburgh.

16:39.833 --> 16:42.208
We will find a way
to reason with him.

16:43.208 --> 16:45.458
Or, we take him out.

16:45.458 --> 16:47.250
I know the kid's mixed up,

16:48.083 --> 16:50.416
but it's time
for some tough love.

16:50.416 --> 16:52.875
I... I need to call the lab.

16:55.416 --> 16:57.416
[beeping]

16:59.000 --> 17:00.166
Joe?

17:00.166 --> 17:02.750
Moira? What on earth?

17:02.750 --> 17:04.125
I wouldn't have called.

17:04.125 --> 17:05.958
But I think you're in danger.

17:05.958 --> 17:07.166
Kevin's out!

17:07.166 --> 17:08.125
Kevin?

17:08.875 --> 17:10.291
Well, put him back.

17:11.125 --> 17:12.875
You know
the election's this week.

17:12.875 --> 17:14.875
I can't have this kind of thing
coming out now.

17:14.875 --> 17:16.875
I worked 16 years
to get this chance!

17:16.875 --> 17:18.291
What do you expect me to do?

17:18.291 --> 17:19.875
You could talk to the boy!

17:19.875 --> 17:21.333
That's all he wants!

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
He does?

17:23.708 --> 17:25.416
Even after
what I did to him?

17:25.875 --> 17:28.708
Okay, Moira,
but after the election!

17:30.000 --> 17:31.125
Joe?

17:32.750 --> 17:34.333
[Xavier]
X-Men, report.

17:36.708 --> 17:38.583
No sign of him
from the west, Professor.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.458
Nothing here from the east.

17:45.250 --> 17:46.250
Same here.

17:47.708 --> 17:49.875
Stay ready. Xavier out.

17:51.250 --> 17:52.708
This can't go on, Moira.

17:53.458 --> 17:56.083
What haven't you told me
about this mutant?

17:56.083 --> 17:57.208
I don't know how to...

17:57.208 --> 17:58.833
[rumbling]

17:58.833 --> 18:00.000
He's here!

18:00.000 --> 18:01.708
Return immediately!

18:01.708 --> 18:02.750
Moira, wait!

18:09.708 --> 18:12.583
Kevin, please, you've got
to come back with me!

18:13.000 --> 18:14.250
Never!

18:14.250 --> 18:16.375
There's a million things
to see,

18:16.375 --> 18:17.708
to feel.

18:17.708 --> 18:19.250
There's more than you taught me.

18:19.250 --> 18:21.958
Why did you keep me
from all these feelings?

18:21.958 --> 18:24.000
But people will be
frightened of you!

18:24.000 --> 18:25.958
They'll try to hurt you.

18:25.958 --> 18:27.375
[Xavier]
She's right, son.

18:28.208 --> 18:29.458
I'm not your son!

18:29.458 --> 18:30.625
I told you,

18:30.625 --> 18:32.875
stay out of my mind!

18:32.875 --> 18:34.250
Talk to me.

18:34.250 --> 18:35.958
Who are you looking for?

18:36.750 --> 18:37.750
My father!

18:37.750 --> 18:39.708
We can help you find him.

18:39.708 --> 18:41.000
Tell me about him.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.875
Ask her! She keeps him away!

18:43.875 --> 18:45.416
Stop this now!

18:45.416 --> 18:47.375
End of the line, kid.

18:47.375 --> 18:48.333
Don't touch him!

18:48.833 --> 18:50.583
He is my son!

18:50.583 --> 18:52.375
Your son?

18:52.375 --> 18:53.416
Why didn't you...

18:54.833 --> 18:56.291
tell me?

18:56.291 --> 18:58.583
You're the one person
I couldn't tell.

18:59.458 --> 19:01.333
When I left you
to marry Joe MacTaggert

19:01.333 --> 19:03.583
and I had his child,
how could I?

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
You underestimate
my feelings for you!

19:07.750 --> 19:09.500
But then you always did.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.500
I committed my life

19:11.500 --> 19:14.208
to mutant research
to save my son.

19:14.208 --> 19:16.458
When you helped me,
you helped him.

19:16.458 --> 19:17.958
Such a burden

19:17.958 --> 19:20.166
to bear alone.

19:20.166 --> 19:22.208
We are no danger to you.

19:28.083 --> 19:29.375
Hold on, Kevin.

19:33.583 --> 19:34.583
[Rogue gasps]

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
Gonna have to do better
than that, Kevin.

19:41.416 --> 19:43.458
[Rogue struggling]

19:43.458 --> 19:44.958
Get them off of me!

19:48.125 --> 19:49.208
[Beast exclaims]

19:49.208 --> 19:51.375
[growling]

19:51.375 --> 19:52.458
[Xavier]
Kevin, no!

19:54.875 --> 19:56.458
Charles, I'm sinking!

19:57.750 --> 19:59.500
Moira, hang on!

20:01.083 --> 20:02.208
Don't struggle.

20:03.416 --> 20:05.166
You'll sink faster.

20:08.958 --> 20:11.000
Day at the zoo's over, kid.

20:12.166 --> 20:15.333
I'm asking you nice, Kevin.
Let them go.

20:16.166 --> 20:18.458
Don't make me bust you up!

20:19.333 --> 20:21.083
Hey! Stop it!

20:22.083 --> 20:23.333
Make it stop!

20:24.333 --> 20:25.291
No!

20:25.875 --> 20:27.458
[screaming]

20:35.583 --> 20:37.333
[groaning]

20:38.333 --> 20:40.000
He's down there somewhere.

20:40.500 --> 20:41.708
They can't stop me.

20:42.333 --> 20:44.208
I'm going to find my father!
