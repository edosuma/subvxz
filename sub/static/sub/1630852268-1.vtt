WEBVTT

00:06.715 --> 00:08.216
I do have a past.

00:08.299 --> 00:12.012
I'm trying to figure out how do I
take ownership of my life, of my actions,

00:12.095 --> 00:14.681
and I don't know where I go from here.

00:14.764 --> 00:16.641
You have been on The Bachelor,

00:16.725 --> 00:18.935
but that doesn't identify who you are.

00:19.019 --> 00:20.895
Why would you sign up
to be the Bachelor?

00:20.979 --> 00:22.981
I didn't sign up
to be the virgin Bachelor.

00:23.064 --> 00:24.274
I was made into that.

00:24.357 --> 00:27.235
We were attracted to each other,
but I felt like there was a wall there

00:27.318 --> 00:29.404
that I didn't have with other men.

00:29.487 --> 00:31.072
You have played football,

00:31.156 --> 00:33.366
but football doesn't identify who you are.

00:33.450 --> 00:35.910
I had to, like, shrink who I was.

00:36.578 --> 00:38.329
Catholic grade school to sports,

00:38.413 --> 00:41.082
and all these sort of signals
saying, "Don't be gay."

00:41.166 --> 00:44.502
I just don't want me being me to be a sin.

00:44.586 --> 00:48.006
-Why go to those extremes?
-Because I wanted to be straight that bad.

00:48.089 --> 00:50.800
Are you scared
about telling your dad?

00:50.884 --> 00:53.970
Heading into a conversation
with him is terrifying.

00:54.554 --> 00:57.557
Who are you?
That's the question you have to answer.

00:59.225 --> 01:01.352
If there's anybody
who I can lean on, it's Gus.

01:01.436 --> 01:04.147
-What do you like? What's your type?
-Daddies.

01:04.230 --> 01:06.357
I think it's about time
we pop your cherry, okay?

01:07.067 --> 01:09.569
-You downloaded Grindr yet?
-You're a little shit.

01:09.652 --> 01:12.655
-Wine does it for me. It's an aphrodisiac.
-I'll go get some wine.

01:12.739 --> 01:15.158
-What do you want?
-An emotional connection.

01:15.241 --> 01:18.078
'Cause I've never had
an emotional connection with a man.

01:19.537 --> 01:23.875
Sharing my story… I'm trying to do right
by a community that I've run from.

01:23.958 --> 01:26.336
I felt so lost. I felt so in limbo.

01:26.419 --> 01:29.130
I wish I had the balls
to tell you you weren't alone.

01:29.214 --> 01:32.801
My foundation for cystic fibrosis
could lose everything.

01:32.884 --> 01:35.553
You present as straight,
and you're a masculine guy.

01:35.637 --> 01:37.347
There's privilege that comes with that.

01:37.430 --> 01:40.600
I had to act like all the other guys
to control the narrative,

01:40.683 --> 01:42.352
and I see that in your eyes.

01:42.435 --> 01:46.106
I took a lot of Xanax, not thinking
I was gonna wake up the next morning.

01:47.148 --> 01:49.025
You kind of have some explaining to do.

01:49.109 --> 01:51.694
In an exclusive interview
this morning with GMA,

01:51.778 --> 01:55.323
former Bachelor star
Colton Underwood came out as gay.

01:55.406 --> 01:57.700
My God! Put that on silent.
It's about to go wild.

01:57.784 --> 02:02.205
Social media exploded with
reactions from fans and celebrities alike.

02:02.288 --> 02:04.749
"Fuck you that
you'll make money being gay,

02:04.833 --> 02:07.919
stringing women along

02:08.002 --> 02:10.046
Cassie is trending too.

02:10.130 --> 02:12.048
She filed
a restraining order against you.

02:12.132 --> 02:14.509
I'm sorry
to Cassie and her entire family

02:14.592 --> 02:16.261
'cause I take full accountability.

02:16.344 --> 02:19.264
What you fucking put her through
was bullshit. There's no excuse.

02:19.347 --> 02:22.142
You wanna apologize
to make yourself feel better.

02:22.225 --> 02:25.562
The best thing you can do is work on you
and face up to what you've done.

02:25.645 --> 02:27.397
What you need to explore

02:28.356 --> 02:29.941
is truly, "Who am I?"

02:45.999 --> 02:48.710
These past few years,
I went through a lot.

02:48.793 --> 02:51.963
I said some things,
I did some things that I'm not proud of.

02:52.046 --> 02:53.423
And I hit rock bottom.

02:54.132 --> 02:57.051
I had been trying
to get my life back together.

02:57.135 --> 02:59.762
I started seeing a therapist,
and he was like,

02:59.846 --> 03:03.183
"I don't wanna be overstepping,
but things aren't adding up."

03:03.266 --> 03:05.476
I lived a lie for 29 years.

03:05.560 --> 03:07.353
And I had to face my truth.

03:07.437 --> 03:10.356
I sort of think
that's what got me to this point today.

03:19.199 --> 03:21.910
-Okay, what are we doing?
-Guac and margaritas.

03:22.535 --> 03:24.662
-Spoon?
-Yep.

03:25.705 --> 03:28.958
I might've…
I might've just bought ready-made guac.

03:30.126 --> 03:32.503
-You… That's so lazy.
-I know.

03:33.129 --> 03:35.924
My mom and I
have a pretty unique relationship.

03:36.007 --> 03:38.176
-Hi, Mom!
-Hi, Colton.

03:38.676 --> 03:42.180
-This is fun, isn't it?
-Yes, it's lots of fun.

03:42.263 --> 03:44.224
My mom and dad
were both D1 athletes,

03:44.307 --> 03:45.892
and, as much as I love my dad,

03:45.975 --> 03:48.603
I feel like I got
a lot of my athleticism from my mom.

03:48.686 --> 03:49.646
There they are!

03:49.729 --> 03:52.065
This next routine
is from our boys' kindergarten.

03:52.148 --> 03:53.107
See? Look at that!

03:55.610 --> 03:56.778
Hand hurts so bad.

03:57.362 --> 04:00.156
When I look back,
grade school was a challenge for me.

04:00.240 --> 04:04.077
I think that's like the first time
that I saw being different

04:04.160 --> 04:06.621
wasn't cool and wasn't okay.

04:07.205 --> 04:09.249
I didn't want to stand out anymore.

04:09.332 --> 04:11.376
I wanted to fit in with everyone else.

04:11.459 --> 04:13.127
But my mom lives her life in a way

04:13.211 --> 04:15.463
in which she doesn't care
what other people think.

04:15.546 --> 04:19.717
And I look up to that so much because
I haven't always been able to do that.

04:19.801 --> 04:23.972
I haven't told her this before,
but I want it to come from me.

04:24.055 --> 04:26.349
That was a messy endeavor, buddy.

04:26.432 --> 04:28.726
-It's like a little picnic.
-Thank you.

04:36.901 --> 04:40.446
Uh, I do have something
I wanna talk to you about.

04:40.530 --> 04:41.531
Um…

04:42.824 --> 04:46.536
You know how, obviously,
this year's been a lot… for me?

04:46.619 --> 04:47.453
Yeah.

04:47.537 --> 04:48.913
But…

04:50.456 --> 04:52.667
I think I've been struggling…

04:53.793 --> 04:56.504
with… my sexuality.

04:58.214 --> 04:59.173
Sorry, I'm nervous.

05:03.886 --> 05:04.887
Um…

05:07.515 --> 05:08.558
Yeah. I don't…

05:08.641 --> 05:09.726
You know…

05:09.809 --> 05:11.894
I guess this is me coming out to you.
I don't…

05:15.815 --> 05:20.695
I'm… a little in shock.

05:25.491 --> 05:28.953
It… It doesn't change,
obviously, my feelings for you.

05:29.037 --> 05:30.872
You know I love you.

05:30.955 --> 05:34.709
But my… my brain just started swimming
with a million questions,

05:34.792 --> 05:38.338
and I don't wanna just… spew them out.

05:39.881 --> 05:42.133
I guess, how long have you…

05:42.216 --> 05:47.472
I think I've known…
since I was like six or seven.

05:47.555 --> 05:48.431
Okay.

05:48.931 --> 05:50.600
Since you were super little.

05:52.143 --> 05:54.437
Yeah, I've always known
that I was different.

05:54.937 --> 05:56.814
But I've always had to hide it.

05:56.898 --> 05:59.901
Growing up, I never had anybody
who I could look at and say,

05:59.984 --> 06:04.072
"It's okay to be gay." I never had that.
And I never wanted to deal with it.

06:04.947 --> 06:06.366
Oh.

06:08.493 --> 06:12.538
Just… My mind is spinning around.
I feel awful you haven't told me before.

06:13.498 --> 06:18.127
I… I feel guilt for not have seen,

06:18.711 --> 06:21.422
not have been able to… I mean…

06:23.758 --> 06:26.302
I felt it was appropriate
to finally share it with you,

06:26.386 --> 06:31.057
just because I was starting to hurt
other people outside of just myself.

06:31.724 --> 06:36.896
I don't want to hide anymore,
and I don't want to carry this anymore.

06:36.979 --> 06:39.107
Since I've started talking about it,

06:39.190 --> 06:43.945
I feel like I have inner peace with myself
for, like, the first time in 28 years.

06:45.363 --> 06:46.572
Then, that makes me sad.

06:46.656 --> 06:49.242
I wish you could have had
inner peace sooner.

06:50.326 --> 06:51.327
I mean…

06:52.495 --> 06:54.122
Should I have known sooner?

06:54.205 --> 06:55.832
To help you navigate this?

06:55.915 --> 06:59.877
-Now I'm feeling… guilty parent syndrome.
-I…

07:00.378 --> 07:04.090
I mean, I've loved my son
from the moment he came into this earth,

07:04.173 --> 07:06.926
and I'll love him regardless,

07:07.009 --> 07:13.015
but I'm in shock that he didn't feel…
like I was a safe harbor.

07:13.099 --> 07:15.351
As a parent,
you think you know your kid, so…

07:16.644 --> 07:18.855
Yeah, a mother wants to protect her child.

07:19.605 --> 07:23.317
I mean, so my first thing
is shielding you from any hate.

07:24.026 --> 07:26.320
'Cause you don't deserve hate.
You're a good kid.

07:27.405 --> 07:28.656
I appreciate it.

07:29.532 --> 07:30.533
You know you are.

07:33.119 --> 07:34.579
Do you have any other questions?

07:34.662 --> 07:36.122
I've got a million of them,

07:36.205 --> 07:38.124
but they're all
discombobulated in my head,

07:38.207 --> 07:40.585
and I can't really
spit them out right now.

07:40.668 --> 07:44.714
I just don't know where to go from here,
because… I feel like--

07:44.797 --> 07:46.924
Are you scared
about telling your dad?

07:47.008 --> 07:47.842
Yeah.

07:48.676 --> 07:51.721
Yeah, it's just gonna be
a lot to try to figure out.

07:53.014 --> 07:54.891
My dad has been someone

07:54.974 --> 07:57.477
who's been my role model
since I've been a little kid.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.854
He loves hunting, he loves his guns.

07:59.937 --> 08:02.273
He was a little more coach
than he was father,

08:02.356 --> 08:04.066
and I think he'll even admit that.

08:04.150 --> 08:07.612
There was nights at the dinner table
that I wanted Dad, not Coach,

08:07.695 --> 08:08.946
but I got Coach anyway.

08:09.864 --> 08:12.575
In college and in my first
couple years professionally,

08:12.658 --> 08:13.743
I would come home,

08:13.826 --> 08:16.078
and first thing he'd want to know
was about next season

08:16.162 --> 08:17.955
and my stats and playing time.

08:18.039 --> 08:21.667
And I just sort of remember losing,
"How are you as a person?"

08:22.502 --> 08:25.546
I don't know if there's a right
or wrong way to do or go about it,

08:25.630 --> 08:26.923
because I feel like…

08:27.006 --> 08:30.259
Even right now, saying it to you,
I feel like I'm doing something wrong.

08:30.343 --> 08:33.304
You're not a parent yet,
so you don't understand.

08:34.347 --> 08:36.766
A mother's love is unconditional, period.

08:37.558 --> 08:40.895
You know, your father and I
raised you to be a good kid.

08:40.978 --> 08:42.063
You're a good kid.

08:45.066 --> 08:46.192
It's gonna be okay.

08:47.193 --> 08:49.654
No matter what,
it's gonna be okay, you know?

08:51.364 --> 08:53.574
I love you. I love you so much.

08:53.658 --> 08:54.867
I love you too.

09:12.677 --> 09:13.553
Damn.

09:13.636 --> 09:14.720
-Perfect!
-Boom!

09:15.221 --> 09:17.014
Give me some for that.

09:17.765 --> 09:20.101
-All right.
-It's almost like I know what I'm doing.

09:22.144 --> 09:23.563
So everything's going good?

09:23.646 --> 09:25.690
-Uh, yeah. I mean, pretty well.
-Yeah?

09:25.773 --> 09:28.901
Like, we just finished
our last contest of the season

09:28.985 --> 09:32.029
and pretty much locked in
my Olympics spot for pipe.

09:32.113 --> 09:35.199
Gus is a friend of mine
that I have admired from afar.

09:35.283 --> 09:37.034
The first time I met Gus,

09:37.118 --> 09:41.247
we both got invited to the same podcast,
and he was very obviously hitting on me.

09:41.330 --> 09:43.291
But we became friends after that.

09:43.374 --> 09:44.584
Starting with a diamond?

09:44.667 --> 09:46.836
-Hopefully, you can keep up.
-Oh gosh.

09:46.919 --> 09:48.004
I don't know about that!

09:48.087 --> 09:49.797
Gus came out very publicly.

09:49.880 --> 09:53.509
He is a professional athlete
and an Olympic medalist.

09:53.593 --> 09:58.556
He's also someone who had to fear
losing everything by publicly coming out.

09:59.265 --> 10:01.225
Gus is probably one of the only people

10:01.309 --> 10:03.853
that, I think,
understands where I'm coming from.

10:03.936 --> 10:07.607
When you are viewed as an athlete,
especially a male athlete,

10:07.690 --> 10:10.735
you're viewed as this tough, macho man,

10:10.818 --> 10:14.905
this bruiser, this thumper,
this tough guy.

10:14.989 --> 10:17.283
We're trained to have these exteriors.

10:17.366 --> 10:19.869
We're trained to have
these hard shells that protect us.

10:19.952 --> 10:24.123
I just think knowing
that I have his support means a lot.

10:28.919 --> 10:31.422
-Cheers. Thanks.
-Cheers. Yeah.

10:31.505 --> 10:32.882
Good day on the slopes.

10:32.965 --> 10:37.261
-You ate shit at the bottom.
-I know. Got a little ambitious.

10:37.345 --> 10:39.930
Ankles are the worst
'cause they just never get better.

10:40.014 --> 10:42.516
Unless you take time off,
but you're never going to.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.101
Nah. That's not my speed.

10:44.185 --> 10:46.604
-Holy fuck, I just thought of something.
-What?

10:46.687 --> 10:49.148
I remember, a while on Twitter,
there was this thing,

10:49.231 --> 10:51.192
"Who's gonna be the first gay Bachelor?"

10:51.275 --> 10:53.986
People would tag me,
"You should be the first gay Bachelor."

10:54.070 --> 10:56.489
It's really funny that
you're the first gay Bachelor.

10:56.572 --> 10:58.949
First gay Bachelor
who didn't have men on his season.

10:59.033 --> 11:00.826
-Oh my God. That's…
-Yeah.

11:03.496 --> 11:05.748
What do you like?
What's your type?

11:05.831 --> 11:07.291
Uh…

11:08.042 --> 11:10.211
I've never told people, and anybody, this.

11:10.795 --> 11:12.880
Um, I… I mean…

11:13.631 --> 11:14.715
So awkward.

11:14.799 --> 11:18.552
I don't… I don't know, I still get awkward
around weird questions like that.

11:18.636 --> 11:20.388
I would need somebody older than me.

11:20.471 --> 11:23.349
-Daddies.
-Mature. So daddies.

11:23.432 --> 11:25.559
I hate myself for saying that right there.

11:25.643 --> 11:27.645
It's the internalized homophobia.

11:27.728 --> 11:29.063
A hundred percent it is.

11:30.356 --> 11:32.400
That's why I wanted
to meet up with you today,

11:32.483 --> 11:36.570
just to pick your brain on some things,
'cause coming out to people is so awkward.

11:36.654 --> 11:42.827
There's just a lot of… moments for me
where, like, I would be more comfortable,

11:43.744 --> 11:46.122
and then I'd take five steps backwards.

11:46.831 --> 11:51.210
Never thought I was gonna get to a point
where I could look at you and say,

11:52.002 --> 11:53.003
"Hey, I'm gay."

11:54.296 --> 11:56.048
To be honest with you, Gus,

11:56.132 --> 12:00.052
I never thought I was gonna come out.
I thought I'd die with this secret.

12:00.136 --> 12:03.931
It's just this thing that we do
as gay people when we're in the closet.

12:04.014 --> 12:06.642
We… We spin it
to be the worst possible thing,

12:06.726 --> 12:10.354
and you make it worse on yourself
and basically torture yourself.

12:10.438 --> 12:13.691
I used to pray that I wasn't gay

12:13.774 --> 12:15.860
and pray that I would
wake up and not be gay.

12:15.943 --> 12:17.903
Have you ever watched RuPaul's Drag Race?

12:17.987 --> 12:19.113
-A little bit.
-Okay.

12:19.196 --> 12:20.906
At the end of every episode, Ru says,

12:20.990 --> 12:23.868
"If you can't love yourself,
how you gonna love anybody else?"

12:23.951 --> 12:25.578
It actually really resonates.

12:25.661 --> 12:29.665
As gay people, I feel like we're just
sort of inherently more empathetic

12:29.749 --> 12:33.169
because you've gone through
this process of truly hating yourself

12:33.252 --> 12:36.964
and struggling with your own identity,
and… and getting through that,

12:37.047 --> 12:38.841
you immediately have common ground

12:38.924 --> 12:41.427
with anyone else in the community
for that exact reason.

12:41.510 --> 12:44.180
And the friendships I have,
the relationships I have,

12:44.263 --> 12:46.891
like, the community that I'm a part of,

12:46.974 --> 12:49.894
that we're a part of,
that you're about to get to be a part of,

12:49.977 --> 12:50.978
it's the best.

12:51.687 --> 12:54.815
When I came out publicly,
I had just started dating a guy,

12:54.899 --> 12:59.361
and he kind of ended up being, like,
my mentor in a lot of ways

12:59.445 --> 13:01.489
and helped usher me into the community,

13:01.572 --> 13:05.201
because I had been
so actively avoiding it.

13:05.284 --> 13:08.245
And, I mean, I wouldn't have
been able to do it without him.

13:08.329 --> 13:11.707
So I'm sort of excited to be that
same thing for Colton, in a way.

13:11.791 --> 13:15.711
Obviously, I have so many similarities.
It's a really similar story to me.

13:15.795 --> 13:19.590
That's 'cause we're cisgender,
white, gay guys, and we did sports,

13:19.673 --> 13:21.425
-and have a lot in common.
-What's "cis" mean?

13:21.509 --> 13:24.637
Cis means that your, uh, gender
that you identify with

13:24.720 --> 13:26.806
is the same as the gender
you were assigned at birth.

13:26.889 --> 13:29.099
I'm happy to be here
for questions like that.

13:29.183 --> 13:34.271
'Cause, like, I know that you've spent
your whole life hiding that part of you.

13:34.772 --> 13:36.190
Growing up in a locker room,

13:36.273 --> 13:39.735
and, obviously, having the pressure
of being a male athlete,

13:39.819 --> 13:41.946
like, I was terrified.

13:42.029 --> 13:43.656
-Yeah.
-Like, scared shitless.

13:43.739 --> 13:45.699
Because, as much as the NFL

13:45.783 --> 13:48.118
and as much as football
wanna say they're ready

13:48.202 --> 13:52.331
for gay people or lesbians
to be in their arena, they're not.

13:52.832 --> 13:55.000
I know that.
You probably know that firsthand.

13:55.084 --> 13:57.378
You do not wanna be
half in the closet, half out.

13:57.461 --> 14:01.131
I can tell you so many people that
I know are gay and people know are gay,

14:01.215 --> 14:03.384
but at work
and in their profession they're not.

14:03.467 --> 14:06.262
And it's just torture.
You don't wanna do that to yourself.

14:06.345 --> 14:07.429
It's just…

14:07.513 --> 14:09.557
It's like a battle
that I'm having with myself

14:09.640 --> 14:12.977
of trying to stay as positive as possible,
and know I'm on the right path,

14:13.060 --> 14:15.312
but still be terrified of like…

14:16.355 --> 14:18.816
damaging my relationship with my family.

14:18.899 --> 14:23.487
The thought of even telling my dad
makes me anxious and nervous, so like…

14:23.571 --> 14:24.947
But, like, if you come out,

14:25.030 --> 14:27.783
you give him the opportunity
to really know you

14:27.867 --> 14:30.452
and to really have
a real relationship with you.

14:30.953 --> 14:34.415
The thing is, you don't have
a relationship with your dad right now

14:34.498 --> 14:36.834
being this other person that's not you.

14:46.802 --> 14:47.636
-What up?
-Hi!

14:47.720 --> 14:48.846
-How are you?
-Good, you?

14:48.929 --> 14:50.347
-Good to see you.
-You too!

14:50.431 --> 14:52.766
-Want me to take my shoes off?
-No, it's a mess.

14:52.850 --> 14:54.435
Wow, it is a mess.

14:55.060 --> 14:57.104
Kassidy and I, we come from the same town.

14:57.187 --> 14:58.981
-Hi, Zukes!
-You remember her?

14:59.064 --> 15:00.232
How are you, girl?

15:00.316 --> 15:01.942
She's always been there for me,

15:02.026 --> 15:05.821
and she's been there for me
not knowing… all of me.

15:06.363 --> 15:08.574
"Congratulations on your new home,

15:08.657 --> 15:11.827
and selfishly I am so happy
you are back in Colorado."

15:11.911 --> 15:14.038
"Cheers, and many more memories together."

15:15.748 --> 15:19.043
Aw. It's our high school
graduation picture. I love it.

15:20.044 --> 15:21.754
-Look at that.
-Perfect.

15:21.837 --> 15:22.671
Thank you!

15:22.755 --> 15:24.423
Can you believe it?
You're a homeowner now.

15:24.506 --> 15:28.135
I know.
You know these last few months have been…

15:29.428 --> 15:31.055
-…a little overwhelming.
-Mm-hmm.

15:31.138 --> 15:33.933
And I think having this
has helped so much too.

15:34.016 --> 15:34.850
Like, my own space.

15:34.934 --> 15:38.395
Because after everything that went down
after my breakup with Cassie,

15:38.479 --> 15:39.897
I moved back in with my dad

15:40.356 --> 15:42.524
and really just had to focus
on myself and--

15:42.608 --> 15:45.319
That was the thing,
my family and I didn't get into a fight,

15:45.402 --> 15:49.198
but they struggled with me with everything
because they would just get sort of sad.

15:49.281 --> 15:51.659
-Yeah.
-Because they feel like they lost me.

15:52.868 --> 15:56.956
They also don't really fully understand
the last two years of my life.

15:57.915 --> 15:58.749
Does anyone?

15:58.832 --> 16:00.668
-No.
-Yeah. There you go.

16:00.751 --> 16:02.544
-Including myself.
-Yeah.

16:02.628 --> 16:05.130
Also, um…

16:05.214 --> 16:06.048
Yeah, so…

16:07.007 --> 16:10.052
there's been something else
that… has happened in my life

16:10.135 --> 16:13.222
that… has sort of changed things for me.

16:13.305 --> 16:14.306
Mm-hmm.

16:15.224 --> 16:19.561
I'm gonna be talking to them
about… me coming out.

16:25.985 --> 16:28.153
Oh my God, I'm so proud of you.

16:28.737 --> 16:30.114
-Yeah.
-Are you okay?

16:30.197 --> 16:31.949
I'm good. It's been a lot,

16:32.032 --> 16:34.702
just because…
I don't think a lot of people understand.

16:34.785 --> 16:37.579
I've been watching it
and just kind of waiting.

16:37.663 --> 16:38.706
-So, you know?
-Really?

16:38.789 --> 16:40.082
Yeah.

16:40.165 --> 16:43.127
Like a friend knows you,
and I'm very happy for you,

16:43.210 --> 16:46.630
even though there's a tear
gonna come down my face.

16:46.714 --> 16:48.799
But… I get it now.

16:48.882 --> 16:52.678
Like, it's all kind of making
a lot more sense, so…

16:52.761 --> 16:55.097
-Now you know my weirdness in high school.
-Well…

16:55.180 --> 16:57.725
-That was always questionable.

16:57.808 --> 16:59.101
All jokes aside,

16:59.810 --> 17:01.353
it's the real you, so…

17:01.437 --> 17:02.271
I know.

17:03.188 --> 17:06.150
-I mean, I feel good, I'm like…
-Sorry. I don't mean to cry.

17:06.233 --> 17:10.362
No. Like, I'm emotional. I'm happy.
I'm nervous. I'm scared.

17:10.446 --> 17:11.989
If you haven't been open about it,

17:12.072 --> 17:15.659
it's not gonna be something that just
comes out naturally all the time, so…

17:15.743 --> 17:17.578
Yeah. Right.

17:18.495 --> 17:19.329
Yeah.

17:19.413 --> 17:23.125
Feel like my biggest defense mechanism
is I would overcompensate.

17:23.208 --> 17:26.754
The captain of the football team dating
the captain of the cheerleading squad.

17:26.837 --> 17:28.172
-Like your typical…
-Yeah.

17:28.881 --> 17:29.715
All that.

17:29.798 --> 17:34.678
Like you kind of always had yourself
in this picture perfect world, and…

17:34.762 --> 17:35.846
Yeah.

17:35.929 --> 17:37.681
…it wasn't your truth, so…

17:41.977 --> 17:44.021
I didn't want to be gay.

17:44.104 --> 17:49.151
And the main voices in my head were
telling me, "You'll get through this."

17:49.777 --> 17:53.781
"Maybe it will just take
one really good girl to change you."

17:53.864 --> 17:56.450
And… that was Cassie.

17:57.451 --> 18:02.247
Everyone saw that first rose ceremony
as just another rose ceremony,

18:02.331 --> 18:05.250
but for me, it was so much more than that.

18:05.334 --> 18:08.420
I felt myself becoming
more of a straight man.

18:09.463 --> 18:12.216
Everyone saw that hometown date
on the beach

18:12.716 --> 18:14.551
and the connection that we had.

18:14.635 --> 18:18.097
But I felt like I found somebody
who could change me.

18:19.139 --> 18:22.101
The night that Cassie
was leaving me on The Bachelor…

18:22.184 --> 18:23.811
I'm not, like, in love.

18:24.394 --> 18:26.396
I don't know if I can get there with you.

18:26.480 --> 18:28.982
…there was a big part of me
that was thinking,

18:29.066 --> 18:30.484
"If I can't get there with you,

18:31.068 --> 18:33.570
then I definitely can't
with any other woman."

18:33.654 --> 18:34.655
After The Bachelor,

18:34.738 --> 18:38.283
our relationship was up and down,
and eventually we broke up,

18:38.951 --> 18:40.661
and I started to spiral.

18:40.744 --> 18:42.371
Four months
after their breakup,

18:42.454 --> 18:44.748
Randolph petitioned the courts
for a restraining order,

18:44.832 --> 18:46.708
claiming he put
a tracking device on her car.

18:46.792 --> 18:48.293
I was fucked up.

18:48.377 --> 18:51.839
I was suppressing my sexuality so hard.

18:51.922 --> 18:56.009
I was taking medication daily
to deal with depression and anxiety,

18:56.093 --> 18:58.303
and that made me a paranoid freak.

18:59.012 --> 19:00.889
I didn't trust a whole lot of people,

19:00.973 --> 19:04.268
and I was trying to do anything
and everything to protect a secret.

19:04.351 --> 19:05.727
I lost my mind,

19:06.436 --> 19:08.438
and I did some things,

19:08.522 --> 19:11.233
I said some things that I'm not proud of.

19:11.316 --> 19:17.197
And that's not me making excuses
for what I did, because I did fuck up.

19:17.281 --> 19:20.784
I made mistakes,
and I will take ownership in that.

19:23.078 --> 19:26.748
Was there, like, a realization
that you had, or what made you…

19:27.958 --> 19:29.793
I, like, um…

19:31.003 --> 19:35.132
-You don't have to talk about it.
-No, actually, I can. Um…

19:36.675 --> 19:39.428
I had a pretty bad weekend in LA.

19:39.511 --> 19:40.888
What do you mean?

19:40.971 --> 19:45.350
So after the breakup with Cassie,
it was… pretty rough.

19:45.434 --> 19:46.518
I hit rock bottom.

19:48.478 --> 19:50.147
I took a lot of Xanax,

19:50.230 --> 19:52.524
not thinking I was gonna wake up
the next morning.

19:52.608 --> 19:53.442
Mmm.

19:53.942 --> 19:55.068
And…

19:55.777 --> 19:56.778
I did.

20:00.324 --> 20:01.408
It was pretty bad.

20:02.784 --> 20:04.328
I literally drove home that day.

20:04.411 --> 20:06.955
I put Zuka in the car
and drove back to Colorado.

20:07.039 --> 20:09.291
And my parents… My family doesn't know.

20:13.795 --> 20:16.089
And I think that was… For me, it's like…

20:16.173 --> 20:18.217
-Yeah.
-I only have one life.

20:18.300 --> 20:19.134
Yeah.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.053
-Something's gotta change, or…
-Yeah.

20:21.136 --> 20:22.262
…I'm not gonna be here.

20:22.346 --> 20:23.263
-Yeah.
-So…

20:23.347 --> 20:25.891
-We want you here.
-I know. I wanna be here.

20:25.974 --> 20:28.685
-Ah.
-And, like, it's in the past now.

20:28.769 --> 20:29.603
Yeah.

20:31.063 --> 20:32.898
That was tough.

20:32.981 --> 20:35.150
Okay, I'm sorry,
can I give you a hug?

20:37.152 --> 20:38.278
Aw.

20:39.863 --> 20:41.823
You were there for me
with my parents' divorce,

20:41.907 --> 20:43.033
and now you're here for this.

20:43.116 --> 20:45.202
It just… It means so much, and…

20:46.078 --> 20:48.247
I'm here for you,
whatever you need.

20:48.330 --> 20:49.748
-It's gonna be a lot.
-Yeah.

20:49.831 --> 20:52.876
Just because…
I haven't told my dad yet, or Connor.

20:52.960 --> 20:54.086
-So…
-Yeah.

20:54.169 --> 20:56.672
…those are gonna be tougher conversations.

20:57.256 --> 21:01.093
My biggest fear in all this is if I have
a broken relationship with my dad, or…

21:01.176 --> 21:03.929
What's your relationship like
with him now?

21:04.012 --> 21:06.765
Him and I,
we were doing so good on our relationship.

21:06.848 --> 21:09.268
Through The Bachelor,
it made us closer, letting him in.

21:09.351 --> 21:13.272
But it was also a lot to be going through
my own personal transformations

21:13.355 --> 21:14.356
under his roof.

21:14.439 --> 21:17.359
-Yeah. Mm-hmm.
-And I've been avoiding him just because…

21:17.442 --> 21:20.195
He probably feels that,
so that's probably why.

21:20.279 --> 21:21.363
Yeah.

21:22.489 --> 21:23.490
Yeah, so…

21:23.573 --> 21:26.034
I know it's gonna be hard
to talk with your family

21:26.118 --> 21:29.204
because they are strong-willed people,

21:29.288 --> 21:32.666
but you gotta make sure
that something like this comes from you.

21:33.583 --> 21:34.584
I'm going to.

21:36.586 --> 21:38.964
And you keep your happiness top-of-mind,

21:39.047 --> 21:42.467
because I don't want
what happened in LA to happen again.

21:43.093 --> 21:44.011
I know.

21:54.021 --> 21:55.647
Uh-oh. Zuka!

21:57.024 --> 21:58.650
-Zuka!
-Get her, Bruce.

21:58.734 --> 21:59.735
That is his bone.

22:01.278 --> 22:04.364
-Will you get… Your dog's a bully.
-She took his bone.

22:04.448 --> 22:06.116
-I know, she's a little bitch.

22:06.199 --> 22:11.204
My brother, Connor, I love the dude,
but we are super competitive.

22:11.288 --> 22:13.248
-Good boy!
-Oh! Bruce won.

22:13.332 --> 22:15.167
We're not about emotions.

22:15.250 --> 22:18.503
We don't share emotions.
He didn't even cry at his wedding.

22:18.587 --> 22:22.299
I was his best man,
and I was sitting there crying for him,

22:22.382 --> 22:24.634
and he was as serious as can be.

22:25.844 --> 22:27.012
Talk to Mom today?

22:27.095 --> 22:29.389
I've not spoken to Dad or Mom.

22:29.473 --> 22:30.432
Why?

22:30.515 --> 22:33.143
I'm… gonna talk to Dad
here shortly too, though.

22:33.852 --> 22:34.686
For what?

22:35.687 --> 22:36.605
Um…

22:38.273 --> 22:39.566
About coming out.

22:45.030 --> 22:45.864
Really?

22:47.574 --> 22:49.034
-Yeah.
-Oh.

22:49.743 --> 22:50.577
All right.

22:51.578 --> 22:52.496
I still love you.

22:54.039 --> 22:55.707
I didn't see that coming, at all.

22:56.291 --> 22:57.542
Grew up Catholic.

22:58.835 --> 23:01.421
Shit, 20 years ago,
they would have killed you, almost.

23:02.381 --> 23:03.215
I know.

23:03.298 --> 23:06.301
I should go to St. Pat's
and tell Sister Mary Ann.

23:07.010 --> 23:08.470
-That's the thing.

23:08.553 --> 23:11.973
With you, like, I was hopeful
that you'd be cool with it and good--

23:12.057 --> 23:13.892
You thought I was gonna storm out of here?

23:13.975 --> 23:14.893
I didn't know.

23:14.976 --> 23:17.104
And I know we don't talk, like, emotions.

23:17.187 --> 23:21.024
-We don't get emotional with each other.
-Not at all. Have you been seeing anybody?

23:21.108 --> 23:23.777
-No. God.
-Have you told Zuka yet?

23:24.403 --> 23:26.196
-Yeah. Zuka knows.

23:26.279 --> 23:27.739
She's known for the longest.

23:27.823 --> 23:30.534
She was so positive,
and she gave me a big kiss.

23:30.617 --> 23:33.120
You're not expecting
a big kiss from me, are you?

23:35.414 --> 23:36.873
You downloaded Grindr yet?

23:37.624 --> 23:39.209
You're a little shit. Fuck you.

23:39.876 --> 23:40.877
What? I don't judge.

23:40.961 --> 23:43.296
Thank God Mom didn't ask me
that question.

23:46.133 --> 23:50.011
-Have you told anybody else?
-So I told Mom, I told Kassidy.

23:50.095 --> 23:50.929
Really?

23:51.805 --> 23:53.390
That's it. And now you.

23:53.473 --> 23:55.100
That's big news.

23:55.183 --> 23:58.437
-Now I gotta talk to Dad.
-Ah. How do you think that's gonna go?

23:59.604 --> 24:01.440
How do you think that's gonna go?

24:01.523 --> 24:03.567
-You scared?
-Yeah.

24:03.650 --> 24:05.235
The hard part about all of this

24:05.318 --> 24:08.655
is I've never envisioned myself
having these conversations.

24:08.738 --> 24:10.949
And when I do, it sucks.

24:11.032 --> 24:14.119
My brother didn't have to come out
as straight to my parents.

24:14.202 --> 24:17.789
He didn't have to explain to people
why he was getting married to a woman.

24:17.873 --> 24:20.333
I don't want to keep having
these conversations,

24:20.417 --> 24:23.920
and I know the more I do it, the more
comfortable I'm gonna get with it,

24:24.004 --> 24:26.298
but I'm scared as hell to tell my dad.

24:26.923 --> 24:29.050
You care too much
about what people think about you.

24:30.010 --> 24:31.011
You just gotta live.

24:31.595 --> 24:33.638
Never a better time to start
than right now, right?

24:33.722 --> 24:34.681
Yeah.

24:51.198 --> 24:54.701
I don't think in the past few years
there's been a day that has gone by

24:54.784 --> 24:56.328
without me calling my dad.

24:56.411 --> 24:59.748
But there's a lot
that has not been said recently,

24:59.831 --> 25:02.918
and that's not how me
and my father have always been.

25:06.963 --> 25:07.881
What's up?

25:07.964 --> 25:09.132
Ready?

25:09.216 --> 25:10.467
What are you wearing?

25:10.967 --> 25:13.136
White tennis shoes
to go fishing in the mud.

25:13.220 --> 25:15.222
Bruh,
I'm just about to look good.

25:15.305 --> 25:16.932
-Right.

25:17.015 --> 25:20.727
'Cause the fish care about that.
Hell, there's dog hair everywhere in here.

25:22.020 --> 25:24.272
I think, looking back
at where I've come from,

25:24.356 --> 25:26.358
all of my family and friendships

25:26.983 --> 25:29.361
and the situations that I grew up in

25:29.444 --> 25:34.658
have never allowed me the safety
or the space that I need to come out.

25:35.659 --> 25:38.078
I remember my decision to leave LA,

25:38.161 --> 25:41.790
and my dad was the first person
to step up and have my back.

25:41.873 --> 25:45.335
I also remember having
a conversation with my dad

25:45.418 --> 25:49.798
in which he sat me down and just said,
"If I'm gonna do this and be here for you,

25:49.881 --> 25:51.132
I need to know everything."

25:51.216 --> 25:54.511
And even by him
going out of his way to say that,

25:54.594 --> 25:56.763
I still didn't have
the courage to tell him.

25:58.098 --> 26:00.559
We ain't the only dumbasses
trying to fish in this weather.

26:00.642 --> 26:03.186
No, the breeze
is gonna be tough with this now.

26:04.729 --> 26:06.773
I always put
a lot of pressure on myself

26:06.856 --> 26:09.609
to live up
to the expectation of my father,

26:10.902 --> 26:13.405
follow in his footsteps and make him proud

26:13.488 --> 26:16.241
and… play football
where my dad played football.

26:16.324 --> 26:19.286
Just really try to build
this legacy of our family.

26:19.786 --> 26:22.831
I always want his approval.
I always want him to love me.

26:22.914 --> 26:24.749
I always want him to be proud of me,

26:24.833 --> 26:26.751
and I never want to let him down.

26:26.835 --> 26:27.669
So…

26:29.254 --> 26:30.088
That's my dad.

26:30.589 --> 26:33.967
-What are you doing tonight?
-Uh, I don't know yet.

26:34.718 --> 26:37.512
I'm just gonna sort of hang out,
see what happens.

26:40.557 --> 26:41.683
What are you guys doing?

26:41.766 --> 26:45.312
We got that call for Reece
with the Tennessee coach at00, now.

26:45.395 --> 26:48.023
-You're gonna be on it?
-Yeah, he wants us on it.

26:49.524 --> 26:52.694
Yeah, go figure, we put the bobbers out
and the wind picks up, huh?

27:05.165 --> 27:09.085
I did sort of want to talk to you
about what happened last year,

27:09.878 --> 27:11.504
with the whole Cassie situation.

27:12.005 --> 27:13.381
Like how I handled it,

27:13.465 --> 27:16.468
and I know that it was probably…

27:17.844 --> 27:20.597
confusing… in many different ways for you.

27:22.474 --> 27:23.308
Yeah.

27:23.850 --> 27:25.518
During that time, I was also…

27:27.646 --> 27:30.065
personally and privately
going through something.

27:30.148 --> 27:30.982
Yeah.

27:32.609 --> 27:38.406
Um, I think… I backed myself into a corner
and, like, doubled down so many times,

27:38.490 --> 27:41.117
running from… who I am.

27:44.704 --> 27:46.790
And I couldn't run anymore.

27:47.415 --> 27:49.834
You backed yourself
into a corner again now?

27:49.918 --> 27:50.752
No.

27:52.879 --> 27:55.590
I don't know. I guess
what I'm trying to tell you is I'm gay.
