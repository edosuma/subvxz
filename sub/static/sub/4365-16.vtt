WEBVTT

00:01.440 --> 00:02.774
- I wanna go legit.
- You can't.

00:02.842 --> 00:04.676
Then I get Lola Jensen
to hack into the bar

00:04.713 --> 00:06.781
and just put me in there
just like she did with Harvard.

00:06.832 --> 00:08.366
Rule number one
of not getting caught,

00:08.451 --> 00:09.918
you don't move
the goddamn body.

00:09.985 --> 00:11.818
Harvey, I'm stuck.

00:11.871 --> 00:14.088
I can't live my whole life
like this.

00:14.156 --> 00:15.457
We're investment bankers.

00:15.508 --> 00:17.658
Our job blows yours
out of the water.

00:17.710 --> 00:18.927
Just admit it,
you want me to take the job,

00:18.994 --> 00:20.178
but you're too afraid
to say it.

00:20.262 --> 00:21.829
I want you to take the job.

00:21.881 --> 00:24.165
You and your associate
conspired with Harold Gunderson

00:24.216 --> 00:26.217
to file a lawsuit
against your own clients.

00:26.302 --> 00:27.635
That is a bribe.

00:27.686 --> 00:29.053
Quelling knows
about your bullshit lawsuit

00:29.138 --> 00:30.054
with Harold Gunderson.

00:30.139 --> 00:31.639
You need to call
Lola Jensen.

00:31.690 --> 00:33.358
You said it yourself,
hacking into the bar

00:33.442 --> 00:35.109
is twice the crime
I've been committing.

00:35.177 --> 00:37.312
I am telling you
Quelling is on the trail,

00:37.363 --> 00:39.113
and you quitting
isn't gonna change that.

00:39.181 --> 00:40.315
You're letting Mike
walk out the door

00:40.366 --> 00:41.449
without trying to stop him,

00:41.517 --> 00:42.784
and anytime I ask you
about anything

00:42.851 --> 00:45.737
all you say is,
"I can't talk about it."

00:45.821 --> 00:47.355
Mike is gone, Harvey.

00:47.406 --> 00:48.523
The jeopardy's gone too.

00:48.574 --> 00:49.824
And now you wanna tell someone

00:49.875 --> 00:52.126
who keeps finding a reason
to be pissed at you,

00:52.194 --> 00:54.128
and it's not the third time,
and it's not the fifth time,

00:54.196 --> 00:55.547
and it's not the last time.

00:55.631 --> 00:57.131
You took money
from our client's competitors

00:57.199 --> 00:58.866
to trump up
your bullshit suit.

00:58.918 --> 01:00.201
The penalty
is being disbarred.

01:00.252 --> 01:02.554
Being a lawyer
is what I am.

01:02.638 --> 01:04.138
And if you take that away--

01:04.206 --> 01:05.138
It's up to you.

01:05.206 --> 01:06.841
I'll drop the suit.

01:06.892 --> 01:09.344
I'm officially a member
of the New York bar.

01:09.395 --> 01:10.711
You went to Lola?

01:10.763 --> 01:13.515
I want to stay.

01:20.489 --> 01:21.573
I'd bring in champagne,

01:21.657 --> 01:22.907
but after
all we've been through,

01:22.992 --> 01:25.443
I think scotch
seems more appropriate.

01:25.528 --> 01:27.445
Does it?

01:29.448 --> 01:31.749
Harvey, we've had
this conversation once.

01:31.834 --> 01:33.501
If you want someone
who doesn't speak their mind,

01:33.569 --> 01:35.670
I'm not that person.

01:35.737 --> 01:36.921
I know.

01:37.006 --> 01:40.041
And Mike staying
doesn't change my opinion.

01:40.092 --> 01:42.877
Telling Scottie about him
is a mistake.

01:42.928 --> 01:45.630
I know.

01:45.714 --> 01:47.081
Then why are you
being so quiet?

01:47.132 --> 01:49.634
Someone who keeps finding
a way to be pissed at me,

01:49.718 --> 01:51.636
and it's not the third time
or the fifth time

01:51.720 --> 01:53.021
or the last time.

01:53.088 --> 01:55.440
- I wasn't gonna say that.
- Yeah, well, you did.

01:55.524 --> 01:57.108
Because you forced it
out of me.

01:57.192 --> 02:02.063
Donna, do you want me
and Scottie to succeed or not?

02:02.114 --> 02:04.065
I want you to be happy.

02:04.116 --> 02:06.117
- That's an evasive answer.
- No, it isn't.

02:06.201 --> 02:09.070
Just isn't up to me
to decide what that means.

02:11.907 --> 02:15.493
Now are we gonna drink
to Mike staying or what?

02:15.578 --> 02:17.912
Give me that.

02:17.963 --> 02:19.998
Not that one.

02:20.082 --> 02:21.082
The bigger one.

02:21.133 --> 02:22.283
Seriously?

02:36.515 --> 02:37.965
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:38.017 --> 02:39.467
I'm so glad you're home.

02:39.518 --> 02:41.653
I made dinner
because I want to celebrate.

02:41.737 --> 02:45.273
I'm not taking the job.

02:45.324 --> 02:46.357
What?

02:46.442 --> 02:48.109
I went to see Harvey,

02:48.160 --> 02:50.311
and, um...

02:50.362 --> 02:52.413
I told him that I'm staying.

02:54.116 --> 02:58.252
What about the fact
that it was eating you up?

02:58.320 --> 03:00.321
Look, Rachel, I know
this isn't what you wanted.

03:00.372 --> 03:01.489
What I wanted?

03:01.540 --> 03:03.341
I didn't wanna give you
my opinion at all,

03:03.425 --> 03:04.709
but you forced it out of me,

03:04.793 --> 03:06.878
and then you told me that you
were gonna take the job.

03:06.962 --> 03:07.962
Okay, Rachel--

03:08.013 --> 03:09.213
No, and now
you come in here,

03:09.298 --> 03:10.598
and you tell me
you're gonna stay a fraud.

03:10.666 --> 03:12.350
- A lawyer.
- A fraud.

03:16.021 --> 03:17.772
What happened
to accepting me for who I am?

03:17.839 --> 03:20.475
What happened
to you taking the job?

03:22.945 --> 03:26.447
It was a way out.

03:26.515 --> 03:28.533
You said you were afraid
if you told me your opinion,

03:28.617 --> 03:30.234
I'd hold it against you,

03:30.319 --> 03:34.072
but now that I'm not doing
what you told me to,

03:34.156 --> 03:35.289
you're holding it
against me.

03:35.357 --> 03:36.290
I am.

03:36.358 --> 03:37.709
Yeah, that's not fair.

03:37.793 --> 03:39.577
I wanna know what changed

03:39.662 --> 03:41.529
from when you told me you were
gonna take the job to now.

03:41.580 --> 03:43.864
I went to see Quelling.

03:43.916 --> 03:45.049
He once had
an offer on the table

03:45.134 --> 03:47.135
that would change his life,

03:47.202 --> 03:48.469
and he turned it down

03:48.537 --> 03:51.472
because he wanted to do
what was right for his clients.

03:51.540 --> 03:53.808
Cost him everything.

03:53.875 --> 03:55.426
The only thing
it didn't cost him

03:55.511 --> 03:57.378
was his ability
to practice law.

03:57.429 --> 03:58.980
And I didn't want
to take it away from him

03:59.047 --> 04:00.047
just like I don't wanna
take it away from me.

04:00.099 --> 04:01.099
Mike.

04:01.183 --> 04:04.268
You said that staying
is eating me up,

04:04.353 --> 04:07.155
but the thought of going
is eating me up more.

04:09.024 --> 04:12.527
I'm just--I'm not ready
to leave, Rachel.

04:17.281 --> 04:20.233
Thanks.

04:20.285 --> 04:21.836
Michael Ross.

04:21.903 --> 04:23.004
Yes?

04:23.071 --> 04:25.673
We'd like to ask you
a few questions.

04:25.741 --> 04:26.791
Who's "we"?

04:26.875 --> 04:30.044
The U.S. attorney's office.

04:31.130 --> 04:32.463
What can I help you with?

04:32.548 --> 04:36.801
We'd prefer to have
this conversation in private.

04:38.920 --> 04:41.889
- Prefer?
- Insist.

04:50.315 --> 04:53.067
Scottie.

04:54.453 --> 04:55.820
I know we got in a fight,

04:55.904 --> 04:58.990
but drinking before 10:00 a.m.,
is that really the answer?

05:01.109 --> 05:02.276
It is on <i>Mad Men.</i>

05:02.327 --> 05:05.780
Who's that guy
think he is anyway?

05:07.166 --> 05:09.116
Mike's staying.

05:10.586 --> 05:11.753
You must be happy.

05:11.804 --> 05:13.454
I am.

05:13.505 --> 05:18.059
Scottie, I'm gonna do better
about being open with you.

05:19.461 --> 05:21.462
Good.

05:21.513 --> 05:25.149
Are we good?

05:25.234 --> 05:26.467
We're good.

05:26.518 --> 05:28.519
Then let's go out tonight
and have some fun.

05:28.604 --> 05:30.855
I'm in.

05:36.111 --> 05:39.580
Scottie.

05:39.648 --> 05:40.665
Yeah?

05:43.652 --> 05:45.586
Let's go somewhere new.

05:49.508 --> 05:51.459
Donna, I don't wanna hear it.

05:51.510 --> 05:52.627
I didn't tell her
about Mike.

05:52.678 --> 05:54.095
Harvey, Stephanie Liston
just called me.

05:54.162 --> 05:57.331
Your friend
from the U.S. Attorney's office?

05:57.382 --> 06:00.000
She said they just brought
Mike in for questioning.

06:03.806 --> 06:05.973
Mr. Ross, Eric Woodall.

06:06.024 --> 06:07.475
I'm the U.S. attorney--

06:07.526 --> 06:08.810
For the Southern district
of New York.

06:08.861 --> 06:10.228
Yeah, I know who you are.

06:10.312 --> 06:13.030
Then you know
you're in a shitload of trouble.

06:13.115 --> 06:16.367
You wanna come clean,
or should I lay it out for you?

06:16.485 --> 06:18.091
I don't know
what you're talking about.

06:18.370 --> 06:20.071
You conspired
with Harold Gunderson,

06:20.155 --> 06:21.989
to defraud
the United States government

06:22.040 --> 06:25.793
by paying off witnesses
against Ava Hessington.

06:25.861 --> 06:28.129
[Chuckles]
What?

06:28.196 --> 06:30.131
You sound surprised.

06:30.198 --> 06:31.749
I am
because it's bullshit.

06:31.834 --> 06:33.718
It's not bullshit.

06:33.802 --> 06:36.220
You're facing some major
prison time, my friend.

06:36.305 --> 06:37.922
- I'm not your friend.
- You can be.

06:38.006 --> 06:39.423
Pass.

06:39.508 --> 06:41.893
I settled a lawsuit, okay?
I didn't do anything wrong.

06:41.977 --> 06:44.478
Hey, I don't think you did.

06:44.546 --> 06:46.731
Well, not on your own anyway.

06:46.815 --> 06:49.216
Is there a question?

06:49.268 --> 06:50.384
Come on,
you're a bright young man.

06:50.435 --> 06:52.386
You see where I'm going.

06:52.437 --> 06:55.156
I don't want the dealer.

06:55.223 --> 06:57.074
I want the supplier.

Sir, you can't
go back there.

07:46.632 --> 07:48.466
Sir!

07:54.090 --> 07:55.340
Well, hey there.

07:55.424 --> 07:57.592
Are you charging him?

07:57.643 --> 07:59.394
- Not at the moment.
- Then he's coming with me.

07:59.461 --> 08:00.979
And you had no right
to bring him in.

08:01.063 --> 08:02.764
I had every right
to bring him in,

08:02.815 --> 08:05.066
but it doesn't matter
'cause he came in voluntarily.

08:05.134 --> 08:06.484
And he's leaving
immediately.

08:06.569 --> 08:08.069
We were just having
a friendly conversation

08:08.137 --> 08:09.521
about the witnesses
who suddenly fell out

08:09.605 --> 08:12.490
of the Ava Hessington case.

08:12.575 --> 08:14.359
Seems your associate
was a little chummy

08:14.443 --> 08:16.578
with the associate
at Bratton Gould.

08:16.645 --> 08:19.614
Harvey Gunderson,
I think, is his name.

08:19.665 --> 08:22.284
Harold Gunderson.

08:22.335 --> 08:24.336
You're right.

08:24.420 --> 08:26.254
You're Harvey.

08:26.322 --> 08:27.956
I gotta keep this
all straight in my head

08:28.007 --> 08:29.457
before I make my case.

08:29.508 --> 08:31.843
Because once
we bring Harold in,

08:31.928 --> 08:33.428
he'll point
the finger at Mike,

08:33.495 --> 08:35.013
who will then
have no choice

08:35.097 --> 08:38.499
but to bring it right home
to you, Harvey.

08:38.551 --> 08:41.352
I promise I won't forget
your name again.

08:41.437 --> 08:43.938
Open that door.

08:46.508 --> 08:50.862
Good talking to you, Mike.
Hope it's the first of many.

08:52.315 --> 08:54.232
Jessica,
I have some dire news.

08:54.317 --> 08:56.034
I was just walking
by the conference room,

08:56.118 --> 08:58.286
and I saw Max Pollard
sitting there all by himself.

08:58.354 --> 08:59.520
Harvey was a no-show?

08:59.572 --> 09:00.789
Don't worry,
I took care of everything,

09:00.856 --> 09:02.907
but it's not like Harvey
to miss a meeting.

09:02.992 --> 09:04.542
Thank you, Louis.
I'll look into it.

09:04.627 --> 09:05.744
You see,
that's just it.

09:05.828 --> 09:07.695
I think something
might be wrong with him.

09:07.747 --> 09:09.581
You mean like he's a spy?

09:09.665 --> 09:11.416
No, Jessica, listen.

09:11.500 --> 09:13.201
Ever since my heart attack,

09:13.252 --> 09:14.552
I've been worrying
about other people's health.

09:14.637 --> 09:16.137
And I'd ask Donna,
but I don't wanna burden her

09:16.205 --> 09:17.505
with the knowledge
of his mortality.

09:17.556 --> 09:19.307
You don't think
Donna knows Harvey can die?

09:19.375 --> 09:20.592
Look, Jessica, I know

09:20.676 --> 09:22.877
Harvey appears to be lean
and relatively fit,

09:22.928 --> 09:25.063
but coronary disease can strike
even the most handsome.

09:25.147 --> 09:26.514
Louis, listen to me.

09:26.565 --> 09:29.184
Harvey isn't sick.
He didn't have a heart attack.

09:29.235 --> 09:30.435
And if he missed
that meeting,

09:30.519 --> 09:33.822
I'm sure there's
a reasonable explanation.

09:33.889 --> 09:34.939
I'm sure you're right.

09:35.024 --> 09:36.074
I'm gonna go check
my blood pressure.

09:36.158 --> 09:38.243
Oh, good idea.

09:46.369 --> 09:47.919
Where the hell is Harvey?

09:48.004 --> 09:49.421
Is he supposed to be
somewhere he's not?

09:49.505 --> 09:52.007
Donna, no games.

09:52.074 --> 09:53.875
He missed a meeting
with a longtime client,

09:53.926 --> 09:56.378
so either you screwed up,
which you never do,

09:56.429 --> 09:59.130
or there's an emergency
I'm not being told about.

09:59.215 --> 10:00.181
Both.

10:00.249 --> 10:02.133
Meaning?

10:03.436 --> 10:04.585
I forgot
to cancel that meeting

10:04.637 --> 10:06.271
because there's
an emergency.

10:06.273 --> 10:06.221
What is it?

10:08.090 --> 10:12.894
Mike Ross got called in
for questioning this morning.

10:15.698 --> 10:17.449
Sorry about this, Harvey.

10:17.533 --> 10:19.117
Could have been worse.

10:19.151 --> 10:20.902
You thought they had me
for being a fraud?

10:20.953 --> 10:22.120
Well, I didn't think
they had you

10:22.204 --> 10:23.738
for overdue library books.

10:23.789 --> 10:25.457
Why'd you go with them
in the first place?

10:25.541 --> 10:26.791
Didn't your grandmother
ever teach you

10:26.876 --> 10:28.326
not to get into cars
with strangers?

10:28.411 --> 10:29.577
I was being cooperative.

10:29.628 --> 10:31.663
Well, don't do that again.

10:31.747 --> 10:33.214
Goddamn Quelling.

10:33.282 --> 10:34.466
He didn't just
hand us to the bar.

10:34.550 --> 10:36.134
He went
to the Justice Department.

10:36.218 --> 10:37.502
I can't believe it.

10:37.586 --> 10:39.337
I looked him in the eye.
He gave me his word.

10:39.422 --> 10:42.006
Screw that guy.
I'm turning him into the bar.

10:42.091 --> 10:43.975
Right now
he's not our problem.

10:44.060 --> 10:45.427
Harold is.

10:45.478 --> 10:46.561
No, I'm gonna talk to him.

10:46.628 --> 10:48.263
Not a chance.

10:48.314 --> 10:49.464
Harvey, they haven't
brought him in yet.

10:49.515 --> 10:50.398
All I need
is five minutes to tell him--

10:50.466 --> 10:51.799
To stick to your story?

10:51.851 --> 10:54.069
That's exactly why they
haven't brought him in yet.

10:54.136 --> 10:55.487
You talk to Harold,

10:55.571 --> 10:56.804
they'll be watching,
we'll be done.

10:56.856 --> 10:58.573
If we don't talk to him
before this Woodall guy

10:58.640 --> 11:00.141
gets him in the room,
we're in deep shit.

11:00.192 --> 11:03.194
Then we need to talk to him
without talking to him.

11:12.838 --> 11:16.508
Allison Holt.

11:16.592 --> 11:19.177
Harvey Specter.

11:19.261 --> 11:21.796
Can't say I'm surprised
to see you.

11:21.847 --> 11:23.998
So I assume that means you've
spoken to the U.S. Attorney.

11:24.049 --> 11:25.133
I have.

11:25.184 --> 11:26.184
Then I suggest
we make sure

11:26.268 --> 11:27.385
we're on the same page.

11:27.470 --> 11:29.304
Unlike you,
I don't automatically

11:29.355 --> 11:32.107
protect someone who may have
jeopardized my firm.

11:32.174 --> 11:34.642
What exactly did you say
when Woodall came to you?

11:34.693 --> 11:36.728
He didn't come to me.
I went to him.

11:36.812 --> 11:38.113
What?

11:38.180 --> 11:39.697
A man named James Quelling
came at me,

11:39.782 --> 11:42.117
questioning the settlement
between Harold Gunderson,

11:42.184 --> 11:44.452
Mike Ross,
and your murder witnesses.

11:44.520 --> 11:46.571
So you go straight
to the U.S. Attorney?

11:46.655 --> 11:47.705
My integrity was questioned.

11:47.790 --> 11:48.957
First step
isn't to go to the person

11:49.024 --> 11:51.209
I'm accused of colluding with
to cover it up.

11:51.293 --> 11:52.693
Answer me one thing--

11:52.745 --> 11:54.546
does Harold Gunderson know
what's going on?

11:54.630 --> 11:55.663
I don't know
what he knows,

11:55.714 --> 11:57.882
and, frankly,
I don't care.

11:57.967 --> 12:00.885
I fired Harold Gunderson
an hour ago.

12:08.010 --> 12:09.761
Can I talk to you
for a second?

12:09.845 --> 12:12.597
Of course.

12:17.153 --> 12:19.053
I just got
taken downtown.

12:19.104 --> 12:20.555
What?

12:20.606 --> 12:23.324
The U.S. Attorney's office
brought me in for questioning.

12:23.392 --> 12:27.445
I thought it was about me,
but it wasn't.

12:27.530 --> 12:28.563
[Exhales]
Thank God.

12:28.614 --> 12:29.831
No, Rachel,
it's still bad.

12:29.898 --> 12:31.032
They're looking
into the settlement

12:31.083 --> 12:33.117
that I made with Harold
before Ava's trial.

12:33.202 --> 12:35.336
That deal
wasn't exactly legitimate.

12:35.404 --> 12:38.923
And they want me
to turn on Harvey.

12:39.008 --> 12:40.508
I knew you should have
taken that job.

12:40.576 --> 12:41.593
This has nothing
to do with that.

12:41.677 --> 12:42.594
Doesn't it?

12:42.678 --> 12:44.095
If you weren't working here,

12:44.180 --> 12:46.247
they wouldn't be able
to use your relationship

12:46.298 --> 12:47.432
with Harvey as leverage.

12:47.516 --> 12:48.683
You think
I would turn my back on him

12:48.750 --> 12:50.351
even if I wasn't
working here?

12:50.419 --> 12:51.919
I don't think you'd ever
turn your back on Harvey.

12:51.971 --> 12:53.271
That's the problem.

12:53.355 --> 12:55.807
- What does that mean?
- Harvey wanted you to stay.

12:55.891 --> 12:57.775
I wanted you to leave.
You chose to stay.

12:57.860 --> 13:00.278
So your priorities,
they seem pretty clear to me.

13:00.362 --> 13:04.148
- Rachel, come on.
- Hey, wait a minute

13:04.233 --> 13:05.433
if they charge you
with something,

13:05.484 --> 13:06.651
they're gonna go
through your records,

13:06.735 --> 13:08.119
and they are going
to realize

13:08.204 --> 13:11.122
that you're not
a member of the bar.

13:13.242 --> 13:15.159
No, they won't.

13:21.417 --> 13:25.136
What are you talking about?

13:25.221 --> 13:26.838
I had Lola Jensen
hack into the bar

13:26.922 --> 13:30.308
and put me
in their records.

13:30.392 --> 13:32.894
And when were
you going to tell me?

13:32.961 --> 13:34.512
I was going to tell you
everything last night,

13:34.597 --> 13:36.481
but you didn't exactly seem
like you were in the mood.

13:36.565 --> 13:39.967
Oh, I'm not
in the mood right now either.

13:40.019 --> 13:41.185
I am gonna go outside
and get some air.

13:41.270 --> 13:42.737
Why don't you just stay here
and figure out

13:42.804 --> 13:44.072
if there's some other crime
you can commit

13:44.139 --> 13:47.325
to get out of this one?

13:55.458 --> 13:57.792
You should have called me
the minute this went down.

13:57.877 --> 13:59.010
There wasn't time.

13:59.078 --> 14:00.612
You had time
to see Allison Holt.

14:00.679 --> 14:02.280
I was trying to get
out in front of it.

14:02.348 --> 14:04.432
Allison Holt
isn't our problem.

14:04.517 --> 14:05.934
Mike Ross is.

14:06.018 --> 14:07.268
The U.S. Attorney
keeps poking around,

14:07.353 --> 14:08.887
he's gonna find out
that his star witness

14:08.938 --> 14:11.439
isn't even in the bar.
No, he won't.

14:11.524 --> 14:13.641
If they look in the bar,
they'll find Mike Ross

14:13.726 --> 14:16.728
listed as a member.

14:16.779 --> 14:18.980
You had him
commit another felony?

14:19.065 --> 14:20.648
You want me
to say that out loud?

14:20.733 --> 14:23.935
No, I don't.

14:23.986 --> 14:25.703
I'd rather get back
to the matter at hand.

14:25.771 --> 14:28.123
We need to make sure
Harold Gunderson doesn't talk.

14:28.207 --> 14:29.407
Then you need
to learn more

14:29.458 --> 14:31.042
about the man
who's trying to make him talk,

14:31.110 --> 14:34.129
because he's coming for you,
and you don't know who he is,

14:34.213 --> 14:35.580
what he'll do,
or what he's got.

14:35.631 --> 14:36.881
I know one thing--

14:36.949 --> 14:38.116
if he had
any kind of proof,

14:38.167 --> 14:40.251
someone here would have
already been arrested.

14:40.302 --> 14:43.287
Arrested?
For what?

14:43.339 --> 14:44.973
We're being investigated
for the settlement

14:45.057 --> 14:47.675
between us and Bratton Gould
in the Hessington case.

14:47.760 --> 14:48.893
Quelling didn't go away?

14:48.961 --> 14:50.478
Quelling threatened
to go to the bar.

14:50.563 --> 14:53.348
This is
the U.S. Attorney's office.

14:53.432 --> 14:56.434
Well, that only matters
if the allegations have merit.

14:59.021 --> 15:00.304
I never thought
I would have to ask this,

15:00.356 --> 15:02.440
but do the allegations
have merit?

15:02.491 --> 15:03.641
We're handling this,
Scottie.

15:03.692 --> 15:04.943
I didn't ask
who was handling it.

15:04.994 --> 15:08.446
I asked
if they have merit.

15:14.003 --> 15:16.087
Scottie.
Scottie.

15:16.155 --> 15:17.321
What, are you
gonna be charming?

15:17.423 --> 15:19.090
Quote a TV show?

15:19.158 --> 15:20.491
What happened to
"I'm going to do better"?

15:20.543 --> 15:22.427
God damn it,
I'm trying.

15:22.461 --> 15:24.796
Harvey, I don't think you
understand what trying means.

15:24.847 --> 15:26.714
You know what, Scottie?
You keep on thinking

15:26.799 --> 15:28.383
that there are things
being withheld from you, but--

15:28.467 --> 15:30.718
But what?
It's just business?

15:30.803 --> 15:33.221
- It is just business.
- Fine.

15:33.305 --> 15:35.273
As a senior partner,
I want to know

15:35.340 --> 15:37.392
if this firm outright
broke any laws.

15:37.476 --> 15:39.110
- Harvey, I need to talk to you.
- Not now, Donna.

15:39.178 --> 15:41.112
If you want me
to talk to Stephanie,

15:41.180 --> 15:42.847
you have to tell me what you
want me to ask her right now.

15:42.898 --> 15:44.649
[Sighs]

15:44.700 --> 15:47.652
I guess it's
"not now, Scottie."

15:51.073 --> 15:53.291
Mike. Mike.
I need to talk to you.

15:53.358 --> 15:54.576
No, no, I can't
even be seen with you.

15:54.660 --> 15:56.161
Go, now.
But you have to talk to me.

15:56.212 --> 15:58.196
Allison Holt
just fired me out of the blue.

15:58.247 --> 15:59.864
I'm freaking out, man.
Harold, listen to me.

15:59.915 --> 16:01.049
You have to calm down,
all right?

16:01.133 --> 16:02.700
Harold Gunderson,
you're not welcome here.

16:02.751 --> 16:04.169
You know what, Louis?

16:04.220 --> 16:05.503
We're kind of in the middle
of something right now, so--

16:05.554 --> 16:07.639
Well, I don't give a shit.
Mike, do me a favor.

16:07.706 --> 16:11.309
Do not let this unappreciative
ex-employee into our offices.

16:11.376 --> 16:13.978
Harold, you have to go,
right now.

16:14.046 --> 16:16.014
No, wait, Mike.
Please.

16:16.065 --> 16:17.932
I got a call
from the U.S. Attorney's office

16:18.017 --> 16:19.651
asking for me to come in.

16:19.718 --> 16:21.069
Somehow,
they're onto what we did,

16:21.153 --> 16:22.070
and I think we need to--
Harold, Harold, Harold.

16:22.154 --> 16:23.688
Harold.

16:23.739 --> 16:25.490
All I know
about that settlement

16:25.557 --> 16:28.326
is that you stuck it to us
because you saw the chance

16:28.393 --> 16:29.661
to get back at us
for firing you.

16:29.728 --> 16:30.745
Mike, that's not true.

16:30.829 --> 16:32.780
I don't want
to hear it, Harold.

16:32.865 --> 16:34.449
What you did
was harsh and vindictive,

16:34.533 --> 16:37.919
but it was completely legal
because you initiated it.

16:38.003 --> 16:39.787
And nobody can prove
anything other than that

16:39.872 --> 16:42.540
as long as we both
remember it.

16:44.760 --> 16:47.712
- I lost my job, Mike.
- I'm sorry about that, Harold.

16:47.763 --> 16:50.515
I wish there was something
I could do.

16:50.582 --> 16:52.016
Now I have to go back inside.

16:52.084 --> 16:54.018
Michael Ross,
Harold Gunderson,

16:54.086 --> 16:55.220
you're under arrest
for conspiracy

16:55.271 --> 16:58.756
to defraud
the United States government.

17:10.653 --> 17:12.787
Hey.
Thanks for meeting with me.

17:12.871 --> 17:14.622
Donna, you can thank me
all you want.

17:14.707 --> 17:16.406
I don't know anything
about Eric Woodall.

17:16.458 --> 17:17.608
Stephanie, come on.

17:17.660 --> 17:19.327
You know everything that goes on
in that office.

17:19.411 --> 17:21.663
You just don't want
to tell me.

17:21.747 --> 17:23.164
What do you want
to know?

17:23.249 --> 17:25.415
Well, how about we start with
why he's coming after Harvey?

17:25.467 --> 17:27.635
Because he hates
dirty lawyers.

17:27.720 --> 17:29.387
He thinks
they're the scum of the earth.

17:29.454 --> 17:30.972
And Harvey got
on his radar?

17:31.056 --> 17:33.341
And the reason
Woodall's not on your radar

17:33.425 --> 17:36.644
is because the last case he won
took him four years.

17:36.729 --> 17:38.680
So you're saying
he'll stop at nothing?

17:38.764 --> 17:40.431
Not that I've ever seen.

17:40.482 --> 17:41.733
Then we need
to know what he's got.

17:41.800 --> 17:43.101
No way.

17:43.152 --> 17:44.969
I called you
when they brought your guy in.

17:45.020 --> 17:46.854
I could lose my job
for that as it is.

17:46.939 --> 17:49.807
You have something else a lot
more important than your job,

17:49.858 --> 17:51.609
thanks to me.

17:51.660 --> 17:53.578
When are you gonna stop
holding that over my head?

17:53.645 --> 17:56.914
In another 30 seconds if you
tell me what I need to know.

17:58.817 --> 18:00.318
Okay.

18:00.369 --> 18:02.203
He's got nothing.

18:02.288 --> 18:05.123
But the thing is,
he wins with nothing.

18:05.174 --> 18:07.458
You just said
he hates dirty lawyers,

18:07.509 --> 18:10.428
and now you're saying
he'll break the law?

18:10.495 --> 18:12.830
He may, he may not.

18:12.881 --> 18:15.967
But he'll definitely
bend the shit out of it.

18:17.803 --> 18:19.003
I want to know
what's going on.

18:19.054 --> 18:20.221
I told you
what's going on.

18:20.306 --> 18:22.190
Harvey and I are taking care
of a situation.

18:22.274 --> 18:25.193
That's a bullshit answer,
and you know it.

18:25.277 --> 18:27.645
I don't know how it went
with you and Edward Darby,

18:27.696 --> 18:29.480
but you come into my office
with that attitude,

18:29.531 --> 18:31.699
and it won't go well
for you with me.

18:31.784 --> 18:32.850
My attitude comes
from the fact

18:32.901 --> 18:33.951
that I worked
for Edward Darby.

18:34.019 --> 18:35.320
I don't want to work
for another one.

18:35.371 --> 18:37.655
You're way out of line.

18:37.706 --> 18:39.957
Your name is not
on the door here.

18:40.025 --> 18:41.409
No, but if this all comes down
because of something

18:41.493 --> 18:42.877
you and Harvey did,
I'm tainted by it.

18:42.961 --> 18:47.048
Then walk away, Scottie.
I'm not stopping you.

18:47.132 --> 18:49.050
No, the noncompete
you had me sign is stopping me.

18:49.134 --> 18:51.336
Is that
what's stopping you?

18:51.387 --> 18:53.588
Jessica, I moved my life
back to New York.

18:53.672 --> 18:55.256
I don't want
to move again.

18:55.341 --> 18:57.592
So I'm asking you
one more time--

18:57.676 --> 19:00.228
what is going on?

19:04.483 --> 19:07.485
What's going on,

19:07.552 --> 19:09.237
is you and Harvey
made an impulsive deal

19:09.321 --> 19:10.855
for you to come here,

19:10.906 --> 19:12.106
and clearly,
it's not working out,

19:12.191 --> 19:13.741
or you'd be having
this conversation

19:13.826 --> 19:16.227
with him and not me.

19:20.115 --> 19:22.867
Well, look what
the cat dragged in.

19:22.918 --> 19:24.369
I've been in here
for two hours.

19:24.420 --> 19:25.569
You said I was under arrest,

19:25.621 --> 19:29.407
but I still haven't
been processed.

19:29.458 --> 19:31.242
I demand to call Harvey.

19:31.293 --> 19:34.295
Sorry, we can't have that.

19:34.380 --> 19:36.297
Then I guess you can't have
a guilty verdict against me

19:36.382 --> 19:38.633
or anybody else,
because I know my rights.

19:38.717 --> 19:40.685
Well, I'm afraid
your rights have run

19:40.752 --> 19:43.688
smack into a little something
called the Patriot Act.

19:43.755 --> 19:44.939
Whatever bullshit
you're trying to pull

19:45.023 --> 19:46.724
only applies to terrorists.

19:46.775 --> 19:48.276
Then it's a good thing
there are allegations

19:48.360 --> 19:51.396
of terrorism against
those Hessington witnesses.

19:55.617 --> 19:56.734
[Sighs]

19:56.785 --> 19:59.120
You're not gonna
get away with this.

19:59.204 --> 20:01.406
I'm not getting away
with anything.

20:01.457 --> 20:05.243
I'm just being thorough by
looking into these allegations.

20:05.294 --> 20:06.461
Try to be patient.

20:06.545 --> 20:07.912
Maybe, uh,
think about the fact

20:07.963 --> 20:10.465
that Harold Gunderson
is trying to be patient

20:10.549 --> 20:13.334
right next door.

20:25.376 --> 20:28.295
Pacing.
Right on schedule.

20:28.379 --> 20:30.297
First sign that a man
is losing it.

20:30.381 --> 20:32.049
It's called walking.

20:32.116 --> 20:33.300
You can call it
what you want.

20:33.384 --> 20:34.468
I know what I'm looking at.

20:34.552 --> 20:36.470
Yeah.
So do I.

20:36.554 --> 20:38.621
A guy who looked
into those terrorist allegations

20:38.673 --> 20:40.340
and came up with nothing.

20:40.425 --> 20:42.476
I'll admit the rumors
about those witnesses

20:42.560 --> 20:44.928
were unsubstantiated.

20:44.979 --> 20:46.813
But I'd be negligent
if I didn't look

20:46.898 --> 20:50.967
into an American with ties
to such questionable characters.

20:51.019 --> 20:53.320
And you never know
what a thorough background check

20:53.404 --> 20:57.357
is gonna turn up.

20:57.442 --> 20:58.775
Then go ahead.

20:58.826 --> 21:00.477
Do your background check,
so I can get out of here,

21:00.528 --> 21:03.530
because all this is doing
is making me bored.

21:03.614 --> 21:05.782
Well, I can take care
of that for you.

21:05.833 --> 21:08.785
Why don't I let you watch
a little TV?

21:17.178 --> 21:19.379
Now, that's pacing.

21:28.306 --> 21:30.273
Did you find out anything
useful on Eric Woodall?

21:30.341 --> 21:33.143
I found out we need
to start going on offense.

21:33.194 --> 21:34.811
How?

21:34.862 --> 21:36.480
Donna's having Mike compile
every piece of communication

21:36.531 --> 21:37.864
during that settlement
to prove

21:37.949 --> 21:40.317
Harold contacted us first,
not the other way around.

21:40.368 --> 21:42.986
- Is that true?
- You really want to know?

21:43.037 --> 21:44.571
After that,
we're gonna read up

21:44.655 --> 21:47.324
on every tactic Woodall used
in his last case.

21:47.375 --> 21:48.325
Case?

21:48.376 --> 21:50.410
Took him four years.

21:50.495 --> 21:51.995
Dog with a bone.

21:52.046 --> 21:53.997
That's why we're going
on offense.

21:54.048 --> 21:56.917
Well, I found out
something too.

21:57.001 --> 21:59.386
Scottie wants to leave.

21:59.470 --> 22:00.754
What?

22:00.838 --> 22:04.040
She asked out
of her noncompete.

22:04.092 --> 22:05.475
And what did you say?

22:05.543 --> 22:07.761
I said I had to discuss it
with my partner.

22:07.845 --> 22:10.514
It would have been nice if she
discussed it with her partner.

22:10.565 --> 22:14.317
She accused me
of some pretty shady shit.

22:14.385 --> 22:15.852
And she's right.

22:15.903 --> 22:17.904
What are you talking about?

22:17.989 --> 22:20.857
I told you earlier,

22:20.908 --> 22:23.860
I didn't want
to know about Mike and the bar,

22:23.911 --> 22:25.362
and just now, you asked me
if I wanted to know

22:25.413 --> 22:27.414
about Mike and Harold,
and again,

22:27.498 --> 22:29.950
I didn't want to know.

22:30.034 --> 22:33.753
And "I don't want to know" is
exactly what Edward Darby said.

22:35.289 --> 22:37.257
We're not him.

22:37.341 --> 22:39.376
Edward Darby didn't
commit those murders.

22:39.427 --> 22:40.877
He just covered them up.

22:40.928 --> 22:43.913
And it seems to me
we keep doing things,

22:43.965 --> 22:47.417
and then we have to keep
covering them up.

22:47.468 --> 22:50.053
We're not him.

22:50.104 --> 22:51.304
Harvey.

22:51.389 --> 22:55.559
What do you want me
to tell Scottie?

22:55.610 --> 22:57.060
If she doesn't want
to be here,

22:57.111 --> 22:59.429
let her go.

23:02.900 --> 23:05.602
[Elevator dings]

23:05.653 --> 23:07.204
What the hell
did you do?

23:07.271 --> 23:08.321
You know what I did.

23:08.406 --> 23:09.573
I handed you in
to the bar.

23:09.624 --> 23:11.158
Mike Ross and I
had a deal.

23:11.242 --> 23:13.443
Yeah, well, that deal
went away when he got brought in

23:13.494 --> 23:15.629
for questioning
by the U.S. Attorney.

23:15.713 --> 23:17.214
What?
That wasn't me.

23:17.281 --> 23:18.582
I didn't go to them.

23:18.633 --> 23:19.949
I don't give a shit
if you went to them or not.

23:20.001 --> 23:21.885
This whole thing started
when you walked into my office

23:21.952 --> 23:24.137
with a lawsuit
you were bribed to create.

23:24.222 --> 23:25.972
And after that,
I made a deal with Mike.

23:26.057 --> 23:27.390
And I held
to my end of the bargain.

23:27.458 --> 23:28.842
Maybe you didn't hear me.

23:28.926 --> 23:30.727
That deal went away
when they picked him up,

23:30.794 --> 23:32.679
hauled him in,
and then tried to get him

23:32.763 --> 23:34.064
to turn on me.

23:34.131 --> 23:35.182
Well, you can still
stop this.

23:35.266 --> 23:37.150
Yeah, well,
I'm not going to.

23:37.235 --> 23:39.269
Well, then you better look
over your shoulder every day

23:39.320 --> 23:42.239
for the rest
of your natural-born life.

23:42.306 --> 23:45.242
- What did you say?
- You heard me.

23:46.911 --> 23:48.495
Listen to me,
you son of a bitch.

23:48.579 --> 23:50.647
You pulled out a gun
and threatened to shoot my guy,

23:50.698 --> 23:52.249
and I don't give a shit
if you didn't mean to shoot it,

23:52.316 --> 23:54.000
because it went off.

23:54.085 --> 23:56.703
They're looking into me
because of you.

23:56.787 --> 23:59.155
And I ever so much
as hear your name again,

23:59.207 --> 24:01.841
I will find you, and I will
break every bone in your body.

24:01.926 --> 24:04.594
You are nothing
but a badass on his high horse.

24:04.662 --> 24:06.596
Well, Mr. badass,
I may have started them

24:06.664 --> 24:07.714
looking into what you did,

24:07.798 --> 24:08.848
but you were the one
who did it.

24:08.933 --> 24:10.884
Quelling,
be on your way.

24:20.611 --> 24:23.780
[Phones ringing]

24:23.847 --> 24:27.284
- Rachel, have you seen Mike?
- No, Louis, I haven't.

24:27.351 --> 24:29.402
Okay.
Is something wrong?

24:29.487 --> 24:30.403
Yeah, something's wrong.
We got into a fight.

24:30.488 --> 24:31.854
I haven't seen him since.

24:31.906 --> 24:33.323
Well, I haven't seen him
since he was talking to Harold,

24:33.374 --> 24:34.857
but I need him to give me--
He was talking to Harold?

24:34.909 --> 24:36.126
Yeah, I don't know,
they were having

24:36.193 --> 24:37.460
some idiotic fight outside.
Why?

24:37.528 --> 24:38.628
No, it's nothing.
I have to go talk to Harvey.

24:38.696 --> 24:41.581
Whoa, wait a second.
Harvey?

24:41.666 --> 24:43.250
Does this have something to do
with why he missed his meeting

24:43.334 --> 24:44.384
this morning?
I can't.

24:44.468 --> 24:46.086
Rachel.

24:46.170 --> 24:48.838
You need to tell me what
the hell's going on right now.

24:48.889 --> 24:51.308
[Sighs]

24:53.043 --> 24:54.561
Donna, I know you saw
what happened in the lobby.

24:54.645 --> 24:55.645
I don't want
to hear about it.

24:55.713 --> 24:56.763
Harvey, I can't find Mike.

24:56.847 --> 24:58.148
What?

24:58.215 --> 25:00.150
I've tried his email,
I've tried texting,

25:00.217 --> 25:01.351
I've looked everywhere.

25:01.402 --> 25:03.403
I'm telling you,
Mike is nowhere to be found.

25:03.487 --> 25:04.938
- Louis, not now.
- Yes, now, Harvey.

25:05.022 --> 25:07.390
I know where he is.

25:07.441 --> 25:10.527
He's under arrest,
along with Harold Gunderson.

25:10.578 --> 25:13.413
We need to get down there
right now.

25:13.497 --> 25:15.248
Let me get this straight.

25:15.333 --> 25:16.916
You two were
in a heated conversation

25:17.001 --> 25:18.535
when we picked you up,

25:18.586 --> 25:20.337
and that had nothing
to do with this.

25:20.404 --> 25:22.422
It had everything
to do with it.

25:22.506 --> 25:24.007
You mean you were
trying to cover your tracks.

25:24.074 --> 25:26.126
No, we were having
a heated conversation

25:26.210 --> 25:28.628
about what bullshit charges
these are.

25:28.713 --> 25:31.097
Okay, I'm done
playing your games.

25:31.182 --> 25:33.916
He was your only friend
at that firm, you got fired.

25:33.968 --> 25:35.435
You got him another job,

25:35.519 --> 25:38.104
and that's why you went to him
to set this whole thing up.

25:38.189 --> 25:39.556
You've got
your information wrong.

25:39.607 --> 25:41.107
He wasn't my friend.

25:41.192 --> 25:42.525
I had the chance
to save his job...

25:42.593 --> 25:44.861
But instead,
he threw me under the bus.

25:44.928 --> 25:47.063
That is why I instituted
this lawsuit.

25:47.114 --> 25:50.099
So you can take your bullshit
allegations somewhere else

25:50.151 --> 25:51.951
because I am not
gonna roll on Harvey.

25:52.036 --> 25:53.536
I'm not rolling on Mike.

25:53.604 --> 25:57.824
And Harold is not
gonna roll on me.

25:57.908 --> 26:01.127
You guys
are well rehearsed.

26:01.212 --> 26:02.662
So I'll ask you again,

26:02.747 --> 26:05.498
is that what you were doing
on the street today?

26:07.668 --> 26:09.753
[Sighs]

26:09.804 --> 26:11.171
Jesus Christ, you know,
you drive like my Nana--

26:11.255 --> 26:12.839
he drives like my Nana,
and she's 102.

26:12.923 --> 26:14.424
Relax, Louis.
Ray's on it.

26:14.475 --> 26:16.593
Nobody's
getting us there faster.

26:16.644 --> 26:17.927
I mean, I can't believe
this whole thing's been going on

26:17.978 --> 26:19.179
and I've been
completely out of the loop.

26:19.263 --> 26:20.513
Louis, I don't want
to rehash it.

26:20.598 --> 26:21.848
Right now,
Mike's in custody.

26:21.932 --> 26:23.183
We need to get him out.

26:23.267 --> 26:26.019
Yeah, and you need to tell me
what the hell happened.

26:26.103 --> 26:27.303
Are you asking
if we broke the law

26:27.355 --> 26:29.272
when we made
that settlement with Harold?

26:29.323 --> 26:33.243
That's exactly
what I'm asking.

26:33.310 --> 26:35.245
We have exposure.

26:38.783 --> 26:40.033
Well, then you better hope
that Ray drives

26:40.117 --> 26:42.752
a little goddamn faster,
because you and I both know

26:42.820 --> 26:44.754
what's going on in there.

26:48.707 --> 26:50.317
Let me tell what
we're dealing with here.

26:51.545 --> 26:56.382
Conspiring to bribe witnesses--
seven years.

26:56.433 --> 26:59.602
You filed a sworn declaration
in support of your suit.

26:59.686 --> 27:02.388
That's perjury--
another two years.

27:02.439 --> 27:03.723
And to top it all off,

27:03.774 --> 27:05.391
the money was
transferred overseas,

27:05.442 --> 27:08.110
which would be--

27:08.195 --> 27:12.398
well, you're a lawyer.
Fill in the blank.

27:12.449 --> 27:14.317
- Wire fraud.
- Bingo.

27:14.401 --> 27:17.937
Big winner.
And your prize is 20 more years.

27:17.988 --> 27:21.324
And here's the thing.
I am gonna make sure

27:21.408 --> 27:23.075
that it's not
a cushy white-collar prison.

27:23.126 --> 27:24.243
[Car horn honking]

27:24.294 --> 27:26.278
This is just ridiculous.

27:26.330 --> 27:28.447
If Harold isn't broken by now,
I'll shit my pants.

27:28.498 --> 27:30.166
If Harold's broken,
then when we get there,

27:30.250 --> 27:34.153
Mike's gonna be
on his way to prison.

27:34.221 --> 27:36.889
Someone needs to get in there
and hold his hand.

27:36.957 --> 27:38.674
Not someone...

27:38.759 --> 27:41.060
You.
Are you serious?

27:41.127 --> 27:42.311
I'm the last person
in the world

27:42.396 --> 27:45.130
that Harold Gunderson
wants to see right now.

27:45.182 --> 27:47.266
Louis,
when we were associates,

27:47.317 --> 27:48.901
who did you fear most?

27:48.969 --> 27:51.237
That's easy.
My mother.

27:51.304 --> 27:54.774
I meant in the firm.

27:54.825 --> 27:56.308
Daniel Hardman.

27:56.360 --> 27:57.326
So who would you most
want to come in

27:57.411 --> 27:59.161
and take on Eric Woodall,

27:59.246 --> 28:02.164
if you were in that room?

28:02.249 --> 28:03.833
- Daniel Hardman.
- Exactly.

28:03.917 --> 28:05.534
Look, Harold may not like you,

28:05.619 --> 28:08.004
but he respects you,
and he's all alone.

28:08.088 --> 28:09.288
Now, when we get there,

28:09.339 --> 28:11.290
I need you to channel
your inner Hardman,

28:11.341 --> 28:12.541
get him to trust you,

28:12.626 --> 28:16.161
and then shut him
the hell up.

28:22.168 --> 28:24.503
Can I talk to you
for a second?

28:24.554 --> 28:25.771
You look concerned.

28:25.839 --> 28:28.224
[Sighs]

28:31.645 --> 28:33.846
Do you know why I never batted
an eye when I found out

28:33.897 --> 28:36.115
Harvey had hired a kid
who didn't go to law school?

28:36.182 --> 28:38.818
Because you're loyal to him.

28:38.869 --> 28:41.537
Because I knew
what was inside him.

28:41.621 --> 28:43.289
And I thought if he had
a protege--

28:43.356 --> 28:45.992
He could have hired
a protege from Harvard.

28:46.043 --> 28:49.128
But he wouldn't have been
forced to protect him.

28:49.195 --> 28:52.465
And he wouldn't have become
the man he is today.

28:52.532 --> 28:56.502
Well, now that protege is
in trouble.

28:56.553 --> 28:57.920
[Sighs]

28:58.005 --> 29:00.923
They have Mike
and Harold Gunderson in custody.

29:02.592 --> 29:04.209
Then Harvey's
in trouble too.

29:04.261 --> 29:06.211
No.

29:06.263 --> 29:08.047
Mike would never
turn on Harvey.

29:08.098 --> 29:10.066
You never know
what might happen to a person

29:10.150 --> 29:12.852
once they get
in that room.

29:15.889 --> 29:16.822
Not now, Scottie.

29:16.890 --> 29:18.223
Donna, I'm just writing him

29:18.275 --> 29:21.444
a note telling him
I wanted to talk.

29:21.528 --> 29:23.446
[Scoffs]
"To talk."

29:26.066 --> 29:28.034
I don't think you know how hard
he's trying.

29:28.085 --> 29:30.402
I know he's trying.

29:30.454 --> 29:32.237
I'm just not sure
that it's good enough.

29:32.289 --> 29:33.672
You knew
who he was, Scottie.

29:33.740 --> 29:36.125
- And I thought he would change.
- I think he has changed,

29:36.209 --> 29:37.126
and if it's not enough
for you, then--

29:37.210 --> 29:38.344
That's not the problem.

29:38.411 --> 29:39.929
I think that he's changed
too much,

29:40.013 --> 29:43.466
and I think it happened
before I got back.

29:43.550 --> 29:45.184
He's a good man, Scottie,

29:45.251 --> 29:48.604
but he's not perfect.

29:48.688 --> 29:50.723
Sometimes you just have to take
what you get,

29:50.774 --> 29:53.025
or walk away.

30:01.618 --> 30:04.487
You know, they did
an experiment a few years back.

30:04.571 --> 30:06.822
Took five mice,
put 'em in a cage,

30:06.907 --> 30:11.077
fed them just enough to survive,
and you know what happened?

30:11.128 --> 30:14.279
One by one,
they cornered the weakest mouse

30:14.331 --> 30:17.633
and ate him alive.

30:17.717 --> 30:20.586
You know what you're gonna be
when you get to prison, Mike?

30:20.637 --> 30:22.922
The weakest mouse.
Bullshit.

30:22.973 --> 30:24.957
They have done studies,
and I've read them,

30:25.008 --> 30:26.225
and that's not what happens.

30:26.292 --> 30:28.761
The only way a mouse
eats one of his own

30:28.812 --> 30:31.313
is if he's been contaminated
by another species.

30:31.398 --> 30:32.815
[Chuckles]

30:32.899 --> 30:34.817
Yeah, you're right.
It's bullshit.

30:34.901 --> 30:37.469
But you know who believed it
when I told it to him,

30:37.521 --> 30:38.687
five minutes ago?

30:38.772 --> 30:41.807
Harold.
[Knock at door]

30:41.858 --> 30:44.910
[Door opens]

30:51.317 --> 30:55.204
Looks like you're out of time.
Harold's ready to talk.

30:57.290 --> 30:59.925
You want to tell me
something first?

31:08.885 --> 31:12.688
Get to him
before he changes his mind.

31:15.025 --> 31:17.193
- I demand to see my client.
- You can see him,

31:17.277 --> 31:19.395
but I'm not letting him go,
'cause in five minutes,

31:19.479 --> 31:22.481
I'm gonna come back to him
with a sledgehammer.

31:26.236 --> 31:28.204
Not so fast.

31:28.288 --> 31:29.705
I demand to see my client,

31:29.789 --> 31:33.209
and my client isn't Mike Ross,
it's Harold Gunderson.

31:33.293 --> 31:36.028
- And you are?
- Louis Litt, Pearson Specter.

31:37.664 --> 31:39.531
You're telling me that a man
who works at the law firm

31:39.583 --> 31:43.219
he's accused of colluding with
just happens to be his attorney?

31:43.303 --> 31:44.553
That's exactly
what I'm saying.

31:44.638 --> 31:46.038
- Bullshit.
- No.

31:46.089 --> 31:47.756
What's bullshit is you thinking
it's up to you

31:47.841 --> 31:50.309
who gets to represent
Harold Gunderson.

31:50.376 --> 31:51.727
So if I walk in there
right now

31:51.811 --> 31:53.479
and ask him who his attorney is,
he's gonna say it's you?

31:53.546 --> 31:54.880
Doesn't matter
what he says.

31:54.931 --> 31:57.850
It's 4:07, and if
you don't let me see my client,

31:57.901 --> 32:00.486
anything he says after this
second will be inadmissible.

32:00.553 --> 32:02.521
And I will rain down
fourth amendment claims on you

32:02.572 --> 32:05.741
for the rest
of your goddamn life.

32:05.825 --> 32:08.410
[Door opens]

32:08.495 --> 32:10.829
If you wanted some me time,
all you had to do was ask.

32:10.897 --> 32:12.364
You'd better have
some good news for me,

32:12.415 --> 32:14.200
otherwise I'm gonna be having
plenty of me time.

32:14.251 --> 32:17.736
Harvey, this Woodall guy
is serious.

32:17.787 --> 32:20.739
- I'm serious too.
- Then why am I still in here?

32:20.790 --> 32:22.925
Because we're waiting
for Louis.

32:23.009 --> 32:24.843
Louis?
To do what?

32:24.911 --> 32:28.130
Convince Harold not to talk.

32:28.215 --> 32:30.516
Holy shit.
Louis is in with Harold?

32:30.583 --> 32:31.884
Harold hates Louis!

32:31.935 --> 32:34.687
It's our best shot.

32:38.225 --> 32:40.776
So what do we do now?

32:40.860 --> 32:44.146
We wait.

32:48.618 --> 32:51.654
Louis, what are you
doing here?

32:51.738 --> 32:52.871
First off, how you doing?

32:52.939 --> 32:54.490
How do you think I'm doing?

32:54.574 --> 32:57.459
I'm in the seventh circle
of hell.

32:57.544 --> 32:59.078
Well, the cavalry
has arrived.

32:59.129 --> 33:02.498
I don't need the cavalry.
I've decided to get out.

33:02.582 --> 33:04.449
Okay, Harold,
you cannot sign a deal.

33:04.501 --> 33:06.285
You'll never work
as a lawyer again.

33:06.336 --> 33:08.971
What do you care?
You fired me as a lawyer.

33:09.055 --> 33:10.289
Now all of a sudden
you're my best friend

33:10.340 --> 33:12.975
when you need something from me?
Go to hell, Louis!

33:13.059 --> 33:15.894
Okay, you know what?

33:15.962 --> 33:17.479
You're right.

33:17.564 --> 33:20.465
I'm not your friend.
Never was.

33:20.517 --> 33:22.851
But the one thing
I've never done is lie to you.

33:22.936 --> 33:26.138
Now, you have a chance
to walk out of here today,

33:26.189 --> 33:27.823
as if none of this
has ever happened,

33:27.907 --> 33:31.910
and all you have to do
is trust me.

33:31.978 --> 33:34.863
You have no idea
who that man is.

33:34.948 --> 33:36.498
No idea?

33:36.583 --> 33:38.500
How do you think
I got in the room?

33:38.585 --> 33:40.869
Okay, well, you know, Louis,

33:40.954 --> 33:43.756
I am glad you got to take
a good look at it,

33:43.823 --> 33:45.791
because if I don't
give them Mike,

33:45.842 --> 33:49.995
I could be in here
for the rest of my life.

33:50.046 --> 33:53.015
Lawyers don't get paid
to look out the window.

33:53.099 --> 33:55.634
[Sighs]

33:55.685 --> 33:57.469
I can't concentrate either.

33:57.520 --> 33:58.837
I just wish
there was something we could do.

33:58.888 --> 34:03.175
Rachel, if this thing
moves forward to trial,

34:03.226 --> 34:05.861
I will do everything
in my power to win.

34:05.945 --> 34:08.013
But there's two minutes left
in the game,

34:08.063 --> 34:10.065
and our star players
are on the field.

34:10.150 --> 34:14.036
So right now,
we just have to have faith.

34:14.120 --> 34:16.371
Wwe?

34:16.456 --> 34:19.158
We.

34:19.208 --> 34:20.958

34:21.027 --> 34:25.197
We're going to be family.

34:25.248 --> 34:28.634
And the way to get to know your
family is by being with them

34:28.701 --> 34:31.703
when their loved ones
are in trouble.

34:34.591 --> 34:37.042
How long do we wait?

34:39.429 --> 34:42.398
As long as it takes.

34:45.402 --> 34:48.737
I want to talk to you
about my defense strategy.

34:48.822 --> 34:50.389
This is
your defense strategy.

34:50.440 --> 34:51.857
If this doesn't work,

34:51.908 --> 34:54.226
you're gonna want to talk
to a different lawyer than me.

34:54.277 --> 34:55.726
Harvey, I don't care
what Harold gives them on me,

34:55.779 --> 34:58.397
I'm not giving them you.

34:58.448 --> 35:00.332
- I want to tell you a story.
- I don't want to hear a story.

35:00.400 --> 35:03.619
It's about the time I decided
to tell my dad about my mom.

35:03.703 --> 35:04.920
You remember what I told you
about her?

35:05.004 --> 35:06.738
- Harvey--
- I was 20,

35:06.790 --> 35:08.090
out of the house,

35:08.174 --> 35:09.741
and I told her
I would never tell him

35:09.793 --> 35:12.744
as long as she never
brought anyone--

35:16.299 --> 35:20.419
I came home to do laundry
one day, and I heard--

35:23.273 --> 35:24.923
I heard,

35:24.974 --> 35:29.728
and then I saw,
and I told him that night.

35:32.949 --> 35:37.619
Because sometimes
it's better to tell.

35:40.907 --> 35:42.941
She deserved that.

35:42.992 --> 35:44.660
So do I.

35:44.744 --> 35:46.445
This whole thing
was my idea.

35:46.496 --> 35:48.613
I gave the go-ahead.
It's me Woodall wants.

35:48.665 --> 35:50.165
- Well, he's not getting you!
- Yes, he is.

35:50.250 --> 35:51.616
No, I don't care
what happens

35:51.668 --> 35:53.218
in that room,
I'm not giving you up!

35:53.286 --> 35:54.670
- Don't be a fool.
- Don't be an asshole!

35:54.754 --> 35:57.756
Listen to me, God damn it,
I'm giving you permission--

35:57.807 --> 35:59.758

what you're giving me!

36:03.179 --> 36:05.347

with Clifford Danner,

36:07.684 --> 36:10.936
then with Lola Jensen,
and then with these witnesses,

36:10.987 --> 36:12.104
and to top it all off,

36:12.155 --> 36:14.573
we suborned perjury
with Edward Darby.

the finger at me, you got that.

it doesn't come to it.

I'm dropping this case.

36:52.948 --> 36:54.165
Then don't.

36:54.249 --> 36:55.950
And I'll come after you
for malicious prosecution.

36:56.001 --> 36:58.786

with an outgoing call to me,
