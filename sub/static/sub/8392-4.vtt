03:12.770 --> 03:15.159
YOU'RE TALKING LIKE THIS,

I JUST--I SOMETIMES FEEL
ISOLATED AT THOSE DINNERS, OKAY?

03:21.580 --> 03:23.298
EVERYBODY'S LOOKING AT ME

03:24.410 --> 03:26.617
ALEX, NO ONE IS LOOKING AT YOU
DIFFERENTLY.

03:26.720 --> 03:28.881
NOBODY CARES. NOBODY'S THINKING

- YOU'RE WELCOME FOR THE RIDE.

15:20.710 --> 15:22.325
- HEY, YOU GUYS,
YOU'RE VERY LOUD.

15:22.430 --> 15:23.772
YOU'RE GONNA WAKE UP
GRANDMA AND GRANDPA.

15:23.880 --> 15:24.915
WHAT'S GOING ON?

15:25.020 --> 15:26.362
- SHE WOULDN'T QUIT TALKING
THE ENTIRE DATE.

15:26.470 --> 15:27.539
IT WAS ALL ABOUT HER.
- EXCUSE ME.

15:27.650 --> 15:28.844
I'M SORRY, YOU KNOW,

15:28.960 --> 15:30.052
THAT YOU WERE SITTING THERE,
BEING RAIN MAN.

15:30.170 --> 15:31.478
I'M SORRY.
- I WASN'T SAYING ANYTHING--

15:31.580 --> 15:33.434
- DON'T SAY "RAIN MAN."
THAT'S NOT NICE.

15:33.550 --> 15:35.950
- GOOD NIGHT, PATTI STANGER.
- WELL, HAVE A NICE EVENING.

15:36.070 --> 15:38.584
YOU'RE WELCOME FOR THE RIDE.
FOR GOD'S SAKES.

15:38.690 --> 15:40.794
- TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED.
- IT WAS TERRIBLE.

15:40.900 --> 15:42.515
- NO.
- TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE.

15:42.630 --> 15:44.074
- NO. I WANTED HIM
TO HAVE A GOOD TIME.

15:44.180 --> 15:46.319
- HE LITERALLY DIDN'T SAY
ONE WORD TO HER.

15:46.420 --> 15:47.489
- HE'S SO SHY.

15:47.600 --> 15:52.355
- HE'S GOTTA TAKE A CLASS OR GET
SOME HELP OR SOMETHING.

15:52.460 --> 15:54.667
- IS HE GONNA BE OKAY?
- I'M NOT SURE.

15:54.780 --> 15:57.010
- THANKS FOR DRIVING.
- YEAH.

15:57.120 --> 15:59.566
THANKS FOR THE THANK YOU.

15:59.680 --> 16:00.669
[horn beeps]

16:00.780 --> 16:02.224
BYE.

16:04.890 --> 16:08.951
_ [reciting Chinese phrases]

16:16.870 --> 16:18.098
- MOM, THAT'S HILARIOUS.

16:18.210 --> 16:19.689
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE
SPEAKING CHINESE.

16:19.800 --> 16:21.722
- OH, THAT'S GOOD.
IT'S MANDARIN.

16:21.840 --> 16:23.660
- OH.

16:23.770 --> 16:25.943
- [speaking Chinese]

16:26.050 --> 16:28.257
- WAIT, MOM,
I CAN'T GO TO THE STORE

16:28.360 --> 16:30.157
WITHOUT FINDING OUT WHY
YOU'RE SPEAKING MANDARIN.

16:30.260 --> 16:32.182
- IT'S JUST SOMETHING
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO

16:32.300 --> 16:33.699
FOR--FOR A LONG, LONG TIME.

16:33.820 --> 16:34.741
DECADES.

16:34.850 --> 16:36.192
- OH.
- YEAH.

16:36.300 --> 16:38.439
HOW DOES IT SOUND?
- GOOD.

16:38.540 --> 16:41.236
I MEAN, I WAS JUST JOKING WHEN I
SAID IT SOUNDED LIKE CHINESE,

16:41.340 --> 16:44.161
BUT, HEY, IT SOUNDS
LIKE CHINESE.

16:44.270 --> 16:48.161
MOM, IT SOUNDS GOOD.
IT SOUNDS LIKE CHINESE.

16:48.280 --> 16:49.588
- WHAT AM I DOING?

16:49.690 --> 16:51.829
LIKE I'M EVER GONNA LEARN
TO SPEAK MANDARIN.

16:51.940 --> 16:54.454
- MOM.
- WHAT AM I DOING?

16:54.560 --> 16:57.142
I'M NEVER GONNA SPEAK
MANDARIN. DO YOU KNOW WHY?

16:57.250 --> 17:00.139
I DON'T FOLLOW ANYTHING
THROUGH.

17:00.260 --> 17:02.421
I'VE BEEN PAINTING
FOR 30 YEARS, RIGHT?

17:02.530 --> 17:04.589
HAVE I EVER HAD A SHOW?
NOT ONE SHOW.

17:04.710 --> 17:08.362
I HAVEN'T HAD ONE SHOW.
NOT EVEN A GROUP SHOW.

17:08.470 --> 17:11.121
NOW WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS?

17:11.230 --> 17:13.790
- YOU DIDN'T WANT A SHOW?
- OH, SARAH.

17:13.890 --> 17:14.982
- MOM, WHAT IS WRONG?

17:15.100 --> 17:17.682
- I'M UPSET ABOUT
DAD'S COMMERCIAL.

17:17.790 --> 17:21.374
- UGH! MOM.
- WHAT?

17:21.480 --> 17:24.586
- IT'S OKAY.
HE'S ACTING, RIGHT?

17:24.690 --> 17:27.102
NO ONE'S GONNA REALLY
THINK HE'S GOT--

17:27.210 --> 17:28.893
- OH, HONEY,
THAT'S NOT IT.

17:29.010 --> 17:31.410
- OH, IS IT 'CAUSE HE HAS TO
KISS THAT LADY ON THE BOAT?

17:31.530 --> 17:33.498
- OH, PLEASE.
- IT WOULD BOTHER ME.

17:33.600 --> 17:36.148
- YEAH, IT'S ANNOYING,
BUT IT'S NOT THAT.

17:36.260 --> 17:39.878
IT'S NOT LIKE I'M JEALOUS
OR ANYTHING.

17:39.980 --> 17:43.290
YOUR DAD'S FEARLESS,
YOU KNOW?

17:43.400 --> 17:46.335
IT'S ONE OF HIS MOST
WONDERFUL QUALITIES.

17:46.440 --> 17:50.092
HE SEES SOMETHING HE WANTS,
HE SETS HIS SIGHTS ON IT,

17:50.200 --> 17:53.897
HE GOES AFTER IT,
HE ACHIEVES IT.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.925
IT'S THE FIRST THING
I LOVED ABOUT HIM.

17:58.040 --> 18:00.372
I HOPED SOME OF IT
WOULD RUB OFF ON ME,

18:00.490 --> 18:02.583
BUT OBVIOUSLY THAT HASN'T
HAPPENED,

18:02.700 --> 18:05.146
SO I'M LEARNING MANDARIN.

18:05.250 --> 18:06.979
BUT I'VE GOT TO GO.

18:07.080 --> 18:11.426
I PROMISED MY AFTERNOON
TO THE FOOD BANK.

18:11.530 --> 18:15.011
[reciting Chinese phrases]

18:15.120 --> 18:16.633
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?
- COOL.

18:16.750 --> 18:18.126
- WANT TO PRETEND YOU HAVE
YOUR OWN MORNING SHOW?

18:18.230 --> 18:19.219
- YEAH.
- YEAH?

18:19.330 --> 18:21.366
YOU WANT TO TAKE A CALL?
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

18:21.470 --> 18:22.505
- ALL RIGHT,
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA SAY?

18:22.610 --> 18:24.168
- HELLO, PEOPLE,
WHAT YOU DOING?

18:24.270 --> 18:25.498
- HEY, I LOVE YOUR SHOW.

18:25.620 --> 18:27.338
FIRST-TIME CALLER,
LONG-TIME LISTEN ER.

18:27.450 --> 18:29.202
UH, HEY, LAST WEEK
ON YOUR, UH,

18:29.310 --> 18:31.107
ON YOUR SHOW
ABOUT PRESIDENTS,

18:31.210 --> 18:32.654
UH, WHY'D YOU LEAVE
RICHARD NIXON OUT?

18:32.760 --> 18:34.443
I THINK HE WAS
AN UNDERRATED PRESIDENT.

18:34.560 --> 18:37.381
- YES, HE WAS.

18:37.490 --> 18:38.525
- OH, I'M GLAD
WE AGREE ON THAT.

18:38.630 --> 18:40.791
NOW, I WANTED YOUR ADVICE
ON A CERTAIN MATTER HERE

18:40.910 --> 18:41.979
THAT'S HAPPENING AT WORK.

18:42.080 --> 18:44.457
I HAVE A CO-WORKER WHO ALWAYS
WANTS TO EAT LUNCH WITH ME

18:44.570 --> 18:46.083
AND, UH, WELL,
TO BE HONEST,

18:46.190 --> 18:47.179
I DON'T ALWAYS WANT TO
EAT WITH HIM.

18:47.290 --> 18:49.326
WHAT DO YOU RECKON
I SHOULD DO?

18:49.430 --> 18:51.819
- YOU SHOULD--
YOU SHOULD EAT--

18:51.920 --> 18:54.150
YOU SHOULD TALK
TO YOUR DAD.

18:54.270 --> 18:57.091
- OKAY, WELL, MY DAD IS
OUT OF TOWN ON BUSINESS.

18:57.200 --> 18:58.815
UH, WHAT SHOULD I DO NOW?

18:58.930 --> 19:01.023
- TALK TO YOUR MOM.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.404
- [laughs] OKAY.

19:03.520 --> 19:06.683
LISTEN, I FOUND OUT
FROM YOUR MOM

19:06.800 --> 19:09.485
THAT MAX WANTS TO EAT LUNCH
EVERY DAY WITH YOU

19:09.590 --> 19:10.693
AND YOU DON'T REALLY WANT TO.

19:10.800 --> 19:13.598
IS THAT THE CASE?
YEAH?

19:13.700 --> 19:16.009
- SOMETIMES I WANT TO
EAT LUNCH WITH JENSEN.

19:16.120 --> 19:20.250
- MM-HMM.
WELL, I UNDERSTAND THAT.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.043
BUT SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO
DO THINGS FOR FAMILY

19:22.160 --> 19:23.468
AND THEY'RE NOT ALWAYS FUN,

19:23.570 --> 19:26.915
BUT YOU DO IT BECAUSE
FAMILY'S SO IMPORTANT.

19:27.020 --> 19:28.260
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

19:28.370 --> 19:32.409
MM-HMM.
WELL, OKAY.

19:32.510 --> 19:35.638
I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU DON'T WANT
TO EAT WITH MAX EVERY DAY.

19:35.760 --> 19:38.024
BUT DO YOU THINK YOU COULD DO IT
FOR JUST A LITTLE WHILE LONGER?

19:38.140 --> 19:39.209
- WHY?

19:39.310 --> 19:42.609
- WELL, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
MAX NEEDS YOU.

19:42.730 --> 19:46.939
- BUT WHY CAN'T HE EAT WITH
SOME OF HIS OTHER FRIENDS?

19:47.040 --> 19:50.737
- WELL, BECAUSE...

19:52.810 --> 19:56.189
MAX HAS SOME PROBLEMS.

19:56.290 --> 19:57.427
YOU KNOW?

19:57.540 --> 19:59.394
- WHAT KIND OF PROBLEMS?

19:59.500 --> 20:02.196
- WELL, IT'S DIFFICULT
FOR HIM TO MAKE FRIENDS.

20:02.300 --> 20:03.983
YOU KNOW HOW YOU CAN JUST
GO UP AND TALK TO ANYBODY

20:04.090 --> 20:05.227
AND EVERYONE LIKES YOU?

20:05.340 --> 20:06.716
KIND OF LIKE ME, RIGHT?

20:06.820 --> 20:09.334
SUPER LIKEABLE.
POPULAR AS ALL GET-OUT.

20:09.440 --> 20:14.230
WELL, YOU KNOW,
IT'S HARD FOR MAX. SO...

20:17.110 --> 20:18.509
DOESN'T HE HAVE FRIENDS?

20:18.630 --> 20:20.655
- WELL, I THINK YOU MIGHT BE
ONE OF HIS ONLY FRIENDS.

20:20.770 --> 20:25.355
THAT'S WHY YOU NEED TO HANG IN
THERE FOR A LITTLE BIT.

20:25.460 --> 20:27.382
- OH.
- AND HELP HIM, YOU KNOW?

20:27.500 --> 20:30.287
- OKAY.
- YEAH?

20:30.400 --> 20:32.948
YOU'LL DO THAT?
- UH-HUH.

20:33.050 --> 20:35.325
- THEN WE'LL REEVALUATE.
- OKAY.

20:35.440 --> 20:37.647
- ALL RIGHT.
I'M REALLY PROUD OF YOU.

20:37.750 --> 20:40.093
- LET'S GO IN THE LOFT.
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO IT.

20:40.200 --> 20:41.883
- YEAH.
- NO MORE RADIO SHOW FOR YOU.

20:41.990 --> 20:43.196
- NO.
- ALL RIGHT.

20:43.310 --> 20:44.789
I COULD HAVE PLAYED THAT
FOR TWO HOURS.

20:46.930 --> 20:48.898
- ARE WE READY TO SHOOT THIS?
- ACTORS TO PLACES!

20:49.000 --> 20:50.069
- ANYBODY GOT A 20 ON Z?

20:50.170 --> 20:51.649
- METALLIC!
- HE'S BY CRAFTING.

20:51.760 --> 20:53.557
- MR. BRAVERMAN.
OH, MR. BRAVERMAN.

20:53.660 --> 20:54.581
- YEAH.

20:54.700 --> 20:55.689
- I GUESS
WE'RE READY TO SHOOT NOW.

20:55.800 --> 20:56.482
- NOW?
- YEAH.

20:56.600 --> 20:57.692
- BUT YOU SAID
YOU WERE LIGHTING.

20:57.800 --> 20:58.789
- COME ON, COME ON,
LET'S DO THIS.

20:58.910 --> 20:59.831
- THE LIGHTING'S PERFECT.

20:59.940 --> 21:01.259
WE HAVE A SMALL WINDOW
SO WE'VE GOT TO GET IT NOW.

21:01.360 --> 21:02.634
- UH, WOULD YOU PUT THAT
IN MY TRAILER?

21:02.740 --> 21:04.082
- SURE, ABSOLUTELY.
- THANK YOU.

21:05.780 --> 21:07.805
- ARE YOU FEELING VIRILE?
- VIRILE, YEAH, I'M READY.

21:07.920 --> 21:09.399

21:09.500 --> 21:10.910
LOSE THE GLASSES.

21:11.020 --> 21:12.464
MAN, EVERYBODY'S SO EXCITED.

21:12.580 --> 21:14.093

21:20.450 --> 21:22.441
ROLL SOUND.
MAKE SOME MAGIC, ZEEK.

SOUND SPEEDING.

21:23.830 --> 21:26.549
AND ACTION!

21:26.660 --> 21:30.380
- ARE YOU WORRIED
ABOUT A STORM?

21:30.490 --> 21:36.144
- STORM? NOPE.
LOOKS LIKE CLEAR SKIES AHEAD.

21:36.260 --> 21:38.728
YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT
A LOT OF LIFE TO LIVE

21:38.840 --> 21:42.014
AND WITH VIRILIA'S HELP,
I'M GONNA LIVE IT ALL.

21:42.120 --> 21:44.293

21:44.400 --> 21:45.298
[kiss]

21:45.400 --> 21:47.436
- AND CUT!

21:47.540 --> 21:48.575

21:48.680 --> 21:50.124
- YEAH?

21:50.230 --> 21:51.299
ALL RIGHT, BACK TO ONE.
- WHAT?

21:51.410 --> 21:52.547
- WE'RE JUST GONNA DO IT
ONE MORE TIME.

21:52.650 --> 21:53.992
- IF IT WAS PERFECT, HOW COME
WE'RE DOING IT AGAIN?

21:54.100 --> 21:56.159
- LOOK, I KNOW YOU'VE
GOT A THEATER BACKGROUND,

21:56.280 --> 21:57.850
BUT I'VE ONLY GOT
30 SECONDS HERE, MAN.

21:57.970 --> 21:59.540
NOT 30 MINUTES.
THIS AIN'T TITANIC,OKAY?

21:59.660 --> 22:01.173
BE HAPPY, MAN.
- OKAY.

22:01.280 --> 22:02.269
- YOU'VE GOT YOUR GIRL,
YOU'RE ON A BOAT.

22:02.390 --> 22:03.618
- YEAH.
- DRUGS ARE WORKING.

22:03.730 --> 22:04.628
- YEAH.

22:04.730 --> 22:05.719
- YEAH.

22:05.840 --> 22:06.932
- RIGHT.

22:07.040 --> 22:08.519
- I NEED YOU TO GIVE MY HEART
AN ERECTION, ALL RIGHT?

22:08.630 --> 22:09.870
- RIGHT.

22:09.980 --> 22:11.004
- YOU NEED TO SELL THIS TO ME.
- OKAY.

22:11.120 --> 22:12.428
- LET'S DO THIS.
THIS IS THE ONE.

22:12.530 --> 22:13.701
THIS IS THE MONEY ONE.
HERE WE GO.

22:13.810 --> 22:15.254
COME ON, PEOPLE.
- ALL RIGHT, PLACES!

22:15.360 --> 22:17.157
- AND ROLL CAMERA.

22:17.260 --> 22:18.249

A LATTE, ZEEK?

22:18.370 --> 22:19.359
- A LATTE?
- YEAH?

22:19.470 --> 22:20.744
- SURE.

22:20.850 --> 22:23.603
- SO WE'VE GOT,
AT THE REVIVAL HOUSE,

22:23.720 --> 22:25.574
THE BREAKFAST CLUB,
WHICH WE'VE SEEN BEFORE,

22:25.680 --> 22:29.753
OR THERE'S LIKE A WEIRD
ANIMATION FESTIVAL,

22:29.860 --> 22:32.169
SO WE BASICALLY HAVE SEEN IT
OR IT'S WEIRD.

22:32.280 --> 22:33.850
- EITHER ONE.
- THAT'S NOT FAIR.

22:33.970 --> 22:35.892
I JUST DESCRIBE THEM TO YOU.
YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE DECISION.

22:36.000 --> 22:39.936
- NEITHER ONE OF THEM
SOUNDS TOO INTERESTING,

22:40.040 --> 22:41.177
SO JUST PICK ONE.

22:41.290 --> 22:42.621
- WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?

22:42.740 --> 22:44.833
WE COULD SEE
THE MICHAEL CERA MOVIE.

22:44.940 --> 22:46.737
- UH, YEAH.

22:46.840 --> 22:48.216
I MEAN, I GUESS
WHAT I'M SAYING IS,

22:48.330 --> 22:49.354
MAYBE I DON'T WANT TO
SEE A MOVIE.

22:49.470 --> 22:52.564
- OKAY.

22:52.680 --> 22:56.389
UH, WE CAN JUST HANG OUT.

23:03.340 --> 23:06.821
- SOMETHING, UM...

23:09.280 --> 23:13.523
SOME--SOMETHING'S OFF.

23:13.630 --> 23:15.348
- UH, SORRY,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

23:15.460 --> 23:19.942
- SOMETHING'S OFF
WITH, UH,

23:20.050 --> 23:24.396
WITH ME.

23:24.500 --> 23:26.912
- YOU HAVE A LOT GOING ON.

23:27.020 --> 23:30.433
DO YOU WANT TO TALK
ABOUT SOMETHING?

23:30.540 --> 23:34.647
- WELL, IT'S NOT
JUST WITH ME. JUST WITH US.

23:37.170 --> 23:39.479
- OKAY. YOU MEAN WITH ME.

23:39.590 --> 23:43.378
- NO, I MEAN WITH US.

23:43.490 --> 23:45.549
AND IT'S REALLY HARD
TO TALK ABOUT,

23:45.660 --> 23:49.653
BUT I HAVEN'T FELT RIGHT
IN A LONG TIME,

23:49.770 --> 23:54.560
AND I DON'T WANT TO PRETEND
ANYMORE, AND THAT'S WHY

23:54.670 --> 23:57.639
I THINK THAT WE SHOULDN'T
SEE EACH OTHER ANYMORE.

24:05.300 --> 24:07.404
- WHY?

24:07.510 --> 24:09.887
- BECAUSE I THINK THAT, UM,

24:10.000 --> 24:12.309
WE'RE IN TWO DIFFERENT PLACES
IN OUR LIFE RIGHT NOW

24:12.410 --> 24:15.538
AND IT'S--IT'S--
IT'S HOLDING US BACK.

24:15.660 --> 24:17.412
IT'S A DISCONAVIEST SOMEWHERE

24:17.520 --> 24:19.863
- ALEX, ALEX, I'M SORRY
ABOUT THE PARTY.

24:19.970 --> 24:22.279
- NO, NO, NO, BABY.
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE PARTY.

24:22.390 --> 24:23.937
IT'S--IT'S SOMETHING ELSE.

24:24.040 --> 24:26.838
IT'S LIKE, A LOT OF TIMES
WHEN WE'RE TOGETHER,

24:26.940 --> 24:29.568
IT FEELS LIKE I'M NOT
EVEN THERE WITH YOU,

24:29.670 --> 24:32.491
AND, HADDIE,
YOU DESERVE SOMEBODY

24:32.600 --> 24:36.980
THAT'S GONNA BE THERE
FOR YOU, ALL THE WAY,

24:37.090 --> 24:38.193
ALL THE TIME,

24:38.300 --> 24:42.407
AND I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN BE
THAT GUY FOR YOU RIGHT NOW.

24:42.510 --> 24:43.545
- YEAH.
- AND I--

24:43.650 --> 24:44.639
- YOU JUST WANT TO BAIL.

24:44.750 --> 24:46.638
- NO, I JUST DON'T THINK--

24:46.760 --> 24:49.547
I THINK IT'S BEST FOR US
IF WE'RE NOT TOGETHER.

24:49.660 --> 24:51.616
- OKAY, YEAH, I GOT IT.
- WAIT, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

24:51.730 --> 24:52.890
CAN YOU--CAN YOU JUST--?
- I DON'T KNOW.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.002
DID YOU WANT TO GO
TO THE MOVIES RIGHT NOW?

24:55.110 --> 24:56.896
- NO, I DON'T WANT YOU TO LEAVE.
WE'RE NOT EVEN DONE TALKING.

24:57.010 --> 24:58.318
CAN YOU JUST WAIT A SECOND?
- I DON'T--

24:58.420 --> 25:00.047
I DON'T REALLY HAVE
ANYTHING TO SAY.

25:00.150 --> 25:03.142
- WELL, CAN I AT LEAST
TAKE YOU HOME?

25:03.260 --> 25:05.251
PLEASE? I INSIST.

25:05.360 --> 25:07.396
I DON'T WANT YOU WALKING AROUND
THIS NEIGHBORHOOD BY YOURSELF.

25:07.500 --> 25:12.745
- OKAY, FINE.

25:12.850 --> 25:14.772
LET'S DO WHAT YOU WANT.

25:19.550 --> 25:20.710
[door slams]

25:20.820 --> 25:24.586
- HADDIE, WAIT. UM,
CAN YOU WAIT A SECOND, PLEASE?

25:24.690 --> 25:29.514
- HEY, GUYS. HI.

25:30.800 --> 25:32.904
- UM, HI, MRS. BRAVERMAN.
- WHERE'D HADDIE GO?

25:33.010 --> 25:34.352
I THOUGHT YOU GUYS
WERE GONNA SEE A MOVIE.

25:34.460 --> 25:36.007
WHERE--
[door slams]

25:44.020 --> 25:46.671
- I-I JUST WANTED TO SAY,
UM, I'M SORRY

25:46.780 --> 25:50.989
FOR--FOR BRINGING YOU GUYS
INTO MY MESS.

25:51.100 --> 25:52.783
JUST, UM, I REALLY--
I REALLY REGRET THAT--

25:52.890 --> 25:53.743
- OH, MY GOSH, HONEY.
DON'T--

25:53.860 --> 25:55.020
- MRS. BRAVERMAN, I DO.

25:55.130 --> 25:55.880
- EVEN WORRY ABOUT IT.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.024
- I KNOW WHEN ME AND HADDIE

25:57.140 --> 25:58.095
FIRST STARTED DATING

25:58.210 --> 26:00.724
THAT I WASN'T EXACTLY
WHAT YOU GUYS EXPECTED.

26:00.830 --> 26:02.866
I KNOW.
- OH, NO.

26:02.970 --> 26:05.894
I MEAN, WE'VE, UH,
GOTTEN PAST ALL THAT STUFF.

26:06.010 --> 26:09.696
WE'RE--

26:09.800 --> 26:15.011
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE LIKE
OUR FAMILY, SO--

26:15.120 --> 26:16.564
- [sighs]

26:19.090 --> 26:20.910
I KNOW YOU PROBABLY
ALREADY KNOW THIS,

26:21.020 --> 26:22.533
BUT YOU'RE A REALLY GOOD MOM.

26:22.650 --> 26:25.096
I LOST MINE
A LONG TIME AGO,

26:25.200 --> 26:30.376
AND I JUST--I FEEL REALLY LUCKY
TO HAVE GOTTEN TO KNOW YOU,

26:30.480 --> 26:31.822
MRS. BRAVERMAN.

26:31.930 --> 26:33.852
- [sighs]

26:36.590 --> 26:39.036
YOU KNOW...

26:39.140 --> 26:40.516
[sighs]

26:40.630 --> 26:42.245
YOU'RE A GOOD KID.

26:42.350 --> 26:44.978
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT.

26:45.080 --> 26:49.801
AND WE LOVE YOU,
SO IT'S OKAY.

26:49.910 --> 26:51.844
- UM, I LOVE YOU GUYS TOO.

26:51.950 --> 26:55.738
LISTEN, UM, CAN YOU JUST
TELL YOUR HUSBAND

26:55.850 --> 26:57.602
I SAID THANK YOU
FOR EVERYTHING?

26:59.890 --> 27:01.926
ALL RIGHT, I GOTTA GO.

27:03.790 --> 27:06.020
AND, UH,
TELL MAX I SAID, UH,

27:06.140 --> 27:07.471
TO KEEP WORKING
ON HIS JUMP SHOT, OKAY?

27:07.590 --> 27:13.415
- AND I LOOK TO YOU
TO SEE TRUTH

27:13.520 --> 27:14.384
- [exhales]

27:17.250 --> 27:25.214
AND I LOOK TO YOU
AND I FEEL NOTHING

27:25.330 --> 27:28.493
- HEY.
- YEAH?

27:28.610 --> 27:30.601
- YOU OKAY?
- UM, YEAH, I'M FINE.

27:30.710 --> 27:34.020
UM, WE--WE'RE NOT GOING
TO THE MOVIES.

27:34.130 --> 27:36.644
I HAVE A LOT OF WORK
TO DO.

27:36.750 --> 27:38.809
- OKAY, UM, I MADE DINNER
IF YOU'RE HUNGRY.

27:38.930 --> 27:40.374
- I'M OKAY, I'M OKAY.

27:40.480 --> 27:41.378
I'M JUST, LIKE, ON A ROLL,

27:41.480 --> 27:43.653
SO I'M PROBABLY
JUST GONNA, UM,

27:43.760 --> 27:45.341
WORK ON THIS UNTIL IT'S DONE.

27:45.450 --> 27:48.578
- AND I LOOK TO YOU

27:48.700 --> 27:49.769
- I LOVE YOU.

27:49.870 --> 27:54.000
- TO SEE TRUTH

27:57.330 --> 27:59.218
- IT WAS THE DAMNDEST THING
YOU EVER SAW, MILLIE.

27:59.330 --> 28:02.083
I MEAN, THEY HAD THE TABLECLOTHS
AND SILVERWARE.

28:02.190 --> 28:04.533
MY GOD, THEY HAD LOBSTER,
FOR PETE'S SAKE.

28:04.640 --> 28:07.643
JEEZ.

28:07.750 --> 28:09.331
- DID YOU HAVE A CHAIR
WITH YOUR NAME ON IT?

28:09.440 --> 28:11.305
- NO, THE CHAIR DIDN'T
HAVE A NAME ON IT,

28:11.410 --> 28:12.308
BUT I HAD A TRAILER, THOUGH.

28:12.410 --> 28:13.547
- YOU HAD YOUR OWN TRAILER?

28:13.650 --> 28:15.094
- OH, WELL, IT WASN'T
MY OWN TRAILER.

28:15.210 --> 28:16.928
THAT DIRECTOR KID
HAD THE BIG TRAILER.

28:17.040 --> 28:19.235
- OH, BUT YOU GOT ALONG
WITH HIM OKAY?

28:22.040 --> 28:23.723
I TELL YOU, MILLIE,
THE KID IS LIKE--

28:23.840 --> 28:24.727
HE LOOKED LIKE AN ALIEN.

28:24.840 --> 28:27.001
I MEAN, THE KID HAS GOT,
LIKE, A MOHAWK

28:27.110 --> 28:29.522
WITH DIFFERENT COLORS ON IT
AND EARRINGS, YOU KNOW.

28:29.630 --> 28:32.975
- WOW. SO HE WAS YOUNG, HUH?
- YEAH, HE WAS REAL YOUNG.

28:33.090 --> 28:35.149
I MEAN, HE WAS LIKE
A TEENAGED KID, YOU KNOW?

28:35.260 --> 28:37.808
BUT HE WAS--HE WAS A PRO.
HE WAS A CLASS ACT.

28:37.920 --> 28:40.059
I MEAN, WE GOT ALONG.
YEAH.

28:40.160 --> 28:43.880
GOD, IT WAS JUST
SO MUCH FUN.

28:43.990 --> 28:51.613
MILLIE, IT WAS--IT WAS
SUCH A GREAT DAY, YOU KNOW?

28:51.730 --> 28:53.300
[sighs]

28:53.420 --> 28:54.512
LET ME ASK YOU.

28:54.620 --> 28:56.440
DO YOU THINK
IT WOULD BE CRAZY

28:56.560 --> 28:59.836
IF I TRIED TO PURSUE SOMETHING
LIKE THIS AT MY AGE?

28:59.940 --> 29:03.148
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
WENT AFTER IT?

29:03.250 --> 29:05.696
GO AHEAD, JUST TELL ME.
TELL ME WHAT YOU THINK.

29:05.810 --> 29:07.118
- YOU MEAN, LIKE,
JUST KEEP DOING IT?

29:07.220 --> 29:11.088
- YEAH.
- SURE, OF COURSE, YOU KNOW?

29:11.190 --> 29:12.430
IF IT'S SOMETHING
THAT YOU LOVE,

29:12.540 --> 29:13.768
DON'T SECOND-GUESS YOURSELF.

29:13.890 --> 29:16.120
I'M COLD.
YOU COLD?

29:16.230 --> 29:19.267
I'M JUST GONNA GO
THROW ON A SWEATER.

29:22.410 --> 29:24.924
- SO WHAT YOU DO IS,
YOU UNLOCK THE TRAP DOOR

29:25.030 --> 29:27.271
SO THAT YOU CAN GO DOWN AND GET
THE LITTLE CIRCLE THINGS,

29:27.380 --> 29:29.245
AND THAT'S HOW YOU GET TO
LEVEL 11.

29:29.350 --> 29:30.965
YOU CAN COME OVER
TO MY HOUSE LATER

29:31.070 --> 29:33.106
AND YOU CAN WATCH ME PLAY IT.

29:35.040 --> 29:36.860
- I'M GONNA GO PLAY
WITH JENSEN.

29:36.980 --> 29:38.800
- BUT I'M NOT DONE EATING
YET.

29:38.910 --> 29:41.879
- BUT--BUT I'M DONE.

29:41.980 --> 29:44.221
- BUT, NO, WE EAT LUNCH
TOGETHER EVERY DAY.

29:44.330 --> 29:46.150
THAT MEANS WE WAIT UNTIL
WE'RE BOTH DONE EATING.

29:46.260 --> 29:48.774
JABBAR, GO BACK OVER THERE.

29:48.890 --> 29:50.915
NO, WE SAID WE WOULD
EAT TOGETHER EVERY DAY!

29:51.030 --> 29:52.156
- STOP!
- NO!

29:52.270 --> 29:53.646
- YES!
- NO, YOU'RE BREAKING THE RULES!

29:53.750 --> 29:55.160
YOU HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL
I'M DONE EATING!

29:55.270 --> 29:56.885
- NO, I DON'T!
- YES, YOU DO!

29:57.000 --> 29:58.479
- NO, I DON'T!
- YES, YOU DO!

29:58.580 --> 30:00.024
- NO, I DON'T!
- YES, YOU DO!

30:00.140 --> 30:01.789
- MY DAD SAID
I HAD TO SIT WITH YOU

30:01.900 --> 30:04.937
BECAUSE THERE'S
SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOU!

30:05.040 --> 30:07.383
- THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH ME!

30:11.530 --> 30:14.419
[both screaming]

30:31.170 --> 30:32.922
- HEY, AMY, CHECK THIS OUT.

30:33.030 --> 30:35.237
- IT'S ALL OVER FACEBOOK.

30:35.350 --> 30:37.068
- OH, MY GOD.
IS THAT MR. CYR?

30:37.180 --> 30:38.727
- YES.
- [laughs]

30:38.830 --> 30:43.142
- DUDE, COME HERE.
LOOK AT THIS PICTURE.

30:43.250 --> 30:47.243
- MR. CYR MAKING OUT
WITH SOME CHICK.

30:47.360 --> 30:50.807
- OH, MY GOD.
- I'LL SEE YOU GUYS.

30:50.910 --> 30:54.323
DREW, SCANDALOUS, RIGHT?

30:54.430 --> 30:58.218
- YEAH, MAN, IT'S HILARIOUS.
IT'S SO FUNNY.

30:58.330 --> 31:00.776
- WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?
- THAT'S MY MOM.

31:00.890 --> 31:02.812
IN THE PICTURE.
THAT'S MY MOM.

31:02.930 --> 31:05.023
- IT IS?
- YES. WHAT IS SHE--?

31:05.130 --> 31:06.779
OH, MY GOD,
IT'S MY WHOLE FAMILY.

31:06.890 --> 31:09.654
EVERYONE IS SO UNSTABLE.
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

31:09.760 --> 31:10.966
I MEAN, SHE WENT FROM MY DAD
WHO WAS,

31:11.070 --> 31:12.935
LIKE, WAS A DRUG ADDICT,
AND NOW SHE'S DATING

31:13.040 --> 31:14.962
SOME HIGH SCHOOL
ENGLISH TEACHER.

31:15.080 --> 31:17.310
AND THEN MY AUNT, SHE'S TRYING
TO BUY A BABY RIGHT NOW,

31:17.420 --> 31:19.729
LITERALLY TRYING TO BUY
PEOPLE'S BABIES.

31:19.840 --> 31:20.829
DID YOU KNOW MY GRANDFATHER

31:20.940 --> 31:22.692
IS DOING ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION
COMMERCIALS?

31:22.810 --> 31:23.834
I MEAN, YOU KNOW WHAT?

31:23.950 --> 31:25.451
NO WONDER OUR DATE
WENT SO BAD.

31:25.570 --> 31:28.459
I MEAN, LET'S BE HONEST.
IT WASN'T GOOD AT ALL.

31:28.570 --> 31:31.186
AND MY SISTER, MY SISTER WASN'T
EVEN SUPPOSED TO BE THERE.

31:31.300 --> 31:33.746
YOU KNOW, I'M THE ONE
THAT ASKED YOU OUT.

31:33.850 --> 31:38.640
GOD, I'M THE ONE
THAT LIKED YOU.

31:38.750 --> 31:40.399
THANKS FOR SHOWING ME
THE PHOTO.

31:43.860 --> 31:45.100
- THE KIDS WERE EATING LUNCH.

31:45.210 --> 31:46.234
I MEAN,
EVERYTHING WAS FINE,

31:46.350 --> 31:48.659
UH, UNTILI HEARD
THE SHOUTING.

31:48.760 --> 31:51.900
AND AS I GOT CLOSER,
MAX PUSHED JABBAR ON THE GROUND.

31:52.010 --> 31:53.147
- HOW DID THIS WHOLE THING
START?

31:53.250 --> 31:54.410
I DON'T GET WHAT HAPPENED.

31:54.530 --> 31:57.943
- MAX TOLD US THAT JABBAR WAS
SUPPOSED TO EAT WITH HIM.

31:58.050 --> 31:59.142
- I'M SORRY,
I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED,

31:59.260 --> 32:02.730
BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT WE
FIGURED OUT THE LUNCH ISSUE.

32:02.850 --> 32:05.489
- THE LUNCH ISSUE?

32:05.610 --> 32:07.919
- [scoffs]

32:08.020 --> 32:09.157
YOU SAID THAT YOU TALKED
TO YOUR BROTHER.

32:09.270 --> 32:10.362
- I SAID I WAS GOING TO

32:10.480 --> 32:11.811
AND I DIDN'T END UP
HAVING TIME TO, 50--

32:11.930 --> 32:13.784
- WHAT IS--
WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?

32:13.890 --> 32:15.369
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

32:15.480 --> 32:16.788
WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON,
CROSBY?

32:16.900 --> 32:19.414
- MAX TOLD JABBAR THAT THEY HAD
TO EAT LUNCH TOGETHER EVERY DAY.

32:19.520 --> 32:21.374
- I THOUGHT THAT THEY
WANTED TO EAT TOGETHER.

32:21.490 --> 32:22.343
- YEAH. WHAT--?

32:22.450 --> 32:25.897
- NOT--NOT ALL THE TIME.
- WHAT?

32:26.010 --> 32:27.170
- SO WHAT DO YOU MEAN,

32:27.290 --> 32:28.552
YOU DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE
TO TALK TO ADAM?

32:28.670 --> 32:30.865
THAT'S WHAT WE AGREED, THAT THAT
WAS THE BEST WAY TO HANDLE THIS.

32:30.980 --> 32:32.732
- I SPOKE TO JABBAR,
WE HAD A CONVERSATION,

32:32.840 --> 32:34.876
AND I THOUGHT THE WHOLE LUNCH
THING WOULD BLOW OVER,

32:34.980 --> 32:36.117
AND IT DIDN'T.

32:36.230 --> 32:37.982
I'M SORRY.
- WHAT DID YOU SAY TO JABBAR?

32:38.090 --> 32:39.114
- IT'S NOT RELEVANT.
IT DOESN'T MATTER, CLEARLY.

32:39.230 --> 32:40.390
- YES, IT IS RELEVANT.

32:40.510 --> 32:42.501
- HE SAID THAT I HAD TO
BE NICE TO MAX

32:42.610 --> 32:45.192
BECAUSE THERE'S
SOMETHING WRONG WITH HIM.

32:45.300 --> 32:47.677
- NO, NO, NO, NO,
THAT IS NOT WHAT I SAID.

32:47.790 --> 32:48.859
- MAX, NOTHING'S WRONG
WITH YOU.

32:48.960 --> 32:50.518
- I SAID THAT WE'RE FAMILY
AND WE NEED TO STICK TOGETHER

32:50.620 --> 32:53.236
AND I SAID THAT MAX
HAS SOME PROBLEMS.

32:53.350 --> 32:55.864
WHO DOESN'T HAVE PROBLEMS?

32:55.970 --> 32:57.369
- YOU SHOULD HAVE
LISTENED TO HER

32:57.490 --> 32:58.752
AND COME AND TALKED
TO ME.

32:58.870 --> 33:00.030
WHAT THE HELL'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU?

33:00.150 --> 33:02.175
- LOOKIT, I WENT OUT
OF MY WAY TO ASK MY SON

33:02.290 --> 33:05.623
TO DO SOMETHING THAT HE DIDN'T
WANT TO DO FOR YOU.

33:05.740 --> 33:08.117
HOW ARE YOU MAD AT ME?
- THIS IS A NEW SCHOOL FOR HIM.

33:08.220 --> 33:09.699
HE'S TRYING TO WORK IT OUT.
- HOW IS THAT RELEVANT?

33:09.810 --> 33:12.119
YOU'RE MAD AT ME BECAUSE
I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU!

33:12.230 --> 33:14.539
- YOU FEEL OKAY SO HE CAN
COME TO A REGULAR SCHOOL

33:14.640 --> 33:15.777
SO HE'S NOT STIGMATIZED.

33:15.890 --> 33:18.199
- AM I SUPPOSED TO BE THE ONLY
ONE WHO CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT?

33:18.300 --> 33:19.437
YOU GUYS CAN TALK ABOUT IT.

33:19.540 --> 33:20.814
YOU CAN TALK ABOUT IT
WITH YOUR SON, BUT I NEVER--

33:20.920 --> 33:22.194
- YOU DON'T GET IT.

33:22.310 --> 33:24.232
HE HAS ASPERGER'S,
AND WE'VE WORKED VERY HARD

33:24.340 --> 33:26.137
TO MAKE SURE THAT HE DOESN'T
VIEW IT LIKE A LIMITATION.

33:26.240 --> 33:27.719
- OKAY, SO I WON'T EVER
TALK ABOUT IT.

33:27.830 --> 33:30.276
- GOOD!
- I MEAN, HONESTLY!

33:30.380 --> 33:31.278

IN THE YEARBOOK.

34:48.870 --> 34:52.044
- HEY.

34:52.150 --> 34:57.326
WELL, I HAVE BEEN PRETTY
FULL OF MYSELF

34:57.440 --> 35:00.159
FOR THE PAST WEEK OR SO,
HAVEN'T I?

35:00.270 --> 35:05.230
- REALLY?
- [laughs] YEAH.

35:05.340 --> 35:07.649
YEAH, I MEAN, YOU KNOW, I--
IT WAS A GOOD JOB.

35:07.760 --> 35:10.308
I REALLY LIKED IT,
BUT HECK, YOU KNOW,

35:10.410 --> 35:13.345
IT'S NOT LIKE I WANT TO DO IT
THE REST OF MY LIFE OR ANYTHING.

35:13.450 --> 35:15.372
- WELL, WHY NOT,
IF YOU LOVE IT?

35:15.490 --> 35:20.769
- WELL, MILLIE, I JUST DON'T
WANT IT TO DRIVE A WEDGE

35:20.870 --> 35:22.110
BETWEEN YOU AND I.

35:22.220 --> 35:23.596
- YEAH, I KNOW.

35:23.700 --> 35:27.045
I KNOW YOU DON'T.

35:27.150 --> 35:29.710
I DID FEEL, UH, LEFT OUT.

35:29.810 --> 35:31.220
[laughs]

35:31.330 --> 35:34.265
I MEAN, YOU WERE JUST
SO HAPPY.

35:34.370 --> 35:38.329
YOU KNOW, YOU WERE
INCREDIBLY HAPPY AND, UH,

35:38.440 --> 35:40.328
I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.

35:40.440 --> 35:42.954
SEE?
THAT'S THE THING.

35:43.070 --> 35:46.824
NONE OF IT HAD ANYTHING
TO DO WITH ME.

35:46.930 --> 35:48.818
BUT IT STARTED ME THINKING
THAT I HAVE TO FIND

35:48.930 --> 35:51.387
SOMETHING LIKE THAT
FOR MYSELF, YOU KNOW?

35:51.490 --> 35:53.629
SOMETHING THAT MAKES ME FEEL
THAT WAY.

35:53.730 --> 35:55.527
MAYBE I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING
MORE WITH MY PAINTING.

35:55.630 --> 35:58.599
YOU KNOW, PUT MY STUFF
OUT THERE.

35:58.700 --> 36:03.399
UM, I STARTED LEARNING
TO SPEAK MANDARIN,

36:03.500 --> 36:05.809
SOMETHING I'VE ALWAYS
WANTED TO DO.

36:05.920 --> 36:07.638
I DON'T KNOW.
SOMETHING.

36:07.750 --> 36:09.297
I'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

36:09.400 --> 36:13.951
THE GOOD THING IS THAT IT, UM,
INSPIRED ME, YOU KNOW?

36:14.060 --> 36:15.300
YOU INSPIRED ME, SO--

36:15.410 --> 36:18.231
- AW, COME ON.

36:18.340 --> 36:19.898
- WELL, YOU DID.

36:20.000 --> 36:20.989
- ME?

36:21.100 --> 36:25.446
- SURE.

36:25.560 --> 36:27.960
SO WHAT WAS IT LIKE,
KISSING A MUCH YOUNGER WOMAN?

36:28.080 --> 36:31.527
WHAT WAS SHE, LIKE 35?

36:31.630 --> 36:35.839
- 28.

36:35.950 --> 36:38.327
OH, MILLIE...

36:42.710 --> 36:44.393
[sighs]

36:44.510 --> 36:48.025
SO, UH, GUESS WHAT?

36:48.130 --> 36:53.477
I STOLE SOMETHING FROM WORK,
AND I WAS THINKING THAT,

36:53.590 --> 36:55.160
YOU KNOW, IF I DID
ANOTHER COMMERCIAL,

36:55.280 --> 36:59.649
MAYBE I SHOULD GET TO KNOW
ITS PROPERTIES.

37:03.220 --> 37:05.552
- YOU DON'T NEED THAT.

37:05.670 --> 37:09.879
- SHAKE YOUR CHAIN...

37:09.980 --> 37:11.356
- YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN.

37:11.470 --> 37:13.222
YOU CAN CALL ME CAPTAIN.
- OOH!

37:13.330 --> 37:14.706
- JUST RELAX.

37:14.810 --> 37:16.220
- [speaking Chinese]

37:16.330 --> 37:17.251
- [laughs]

37:17.370 --> 37:20.123
- [speaking Chinese]

37:20.230 --> 37:24.052
- OH, MY SOUL

37:24.170 --> 37:25.262
[pebble clacks
against window]

37:25.380 --> 37:26.950
MMM

37:27.070 --> 37:29.584
OH

37:29.690 --> 37:30.827

37:30.930 --> 37:32.488
MMM

37:32.590 --> 37:36.959
[pebbles clack
against window]

37:37.080 --> 37:43.007
EACH DAY

37:43.120 --> 37:47.910
A LIVING PRAYER

37:48.020 --> 37:50.113
- HEY.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

37:50.230 --> 37:53.267
- WERE YOU SLEEPING?
- NO, NO, I WASN'T.

37:53.370 --> 37:56.407
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
- I SNUCK OUT.

37:56.510 --> 37:58.922
- NICE.
[laughs]

37:59.030 --> 38:00.850
HEY, I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

38:00.960 --> 38:04.964
I-I WANTED TO SAY I'M SORRY
ABOUT WHAT I SAID AT SCHOOL.

38:05.070 --> 38:06.753
I WAS COMPLETELY
OVERREACTING.

38:06.870 --> 38:08.724
I WAS ACTING CRAZY.

38:11.630 --> 38:14.519
- I DON'T--I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE CRAZY.

38:14.630 --> 38:20.353
- TAKE BACK YOUR SIGH

38:20.470 --> 38:22.222
- YOU WANT TO GO
FOR A WALK?

38:26.750 --> 38:28.081
JUST ONE SECOND.

38:28.200 --> 38:32.022
- HEY, HEY!
I LIKE YOUR PJs.

38:32.130 --> 38:33.609
-OH

38:33.720 --> 38:36.587
- THANK YOU.

38:36.690 --> 38:38.203
[clatter]

38:38.310 --> 38:41.757
- OH, MY SOUL

38:47.600 --> 38:49.693
[knocking softly]

38:53.670 --> 38:56.776
[music playing
through headphones]

39:00.750 --> 39:02.843
- HI, MOM.

39:02.960 --> 39:04.268
[turns music off]

39:04.370 --> 39:05.678
- HEY, HONEY.

39:05.790 --> 39:07.997
[door closes]

39:13.210 --> 39:16.828
- WE BROKE UP.

39:16.940 --> 39:18.555
- I'M SORRY.

39:21.350 --> 39:22.487
- [sniffles]

39:22.600 --> 39:29.324
I JUST--I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY,
IF HE LOVES ME,

39:29.430 --> 39:33.434
HE DOESN'T WANT TO BE
WITH ME.

39:33.540 --> 39:36.885
- [sighs]
I DON'T KNOW AND--

39:36.990 --> 39:39.197
- I FEEL LIKE I DID
SOMETHING WRONG.

39:39.300 --> 39:41.165
- NO, YOU DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING WRONG.

39:41.270 --> 39:43.261
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT,
OKAY?

39:43.380 --> 39:44.472
THIS IS ABOUT HIM.

39:44.580 --> 39:47.890
LISTEN, SOMETIMES PEOPLE--

39:48.000 --> 39:52.960
IT'S--IT JUST HAPPENS.
IT'S OKAY.

39:53.080 --> 39:58.040
- [crying]

39:58.150 --> 40:00.835
- IT'S OKAY, BABY.
IT'S OKAY.

40:00.950 --> 40:03.908

40:42.190 --> 40:44.499

40:44.610 --> 40:47.602

I'M DOING?

40:47.720 --> 40:48.880
OW.

40:48.990 --> 40:49.786
- [laughs]

40:49.890 --> 40:50.993
- WHAT ARE YOU
LAUGHING AT?

40:51.100 --> 40:52.237
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE LIKE
THE LAST PERSON IN THE WORLD

40:52.340 --> 40:53.238
I WANT TO SEE RIGHT NOW.

40:53.340 --> 40:54.443
- YEAH?

40:54.550 --> 40:56.097
WHY ARE YOU RUNNING
MIC CABLE RIGHT NOW?

40:56.210 --> 40:58.587
- UH, I AM RUNNING MIC CABLE

40:58.690 --> 41:00.749
BECAUSE I WANT TO SEE IF
I COULD GET THIS TO WORK.

41:00.870 --> 41:02.792
- UH-HUH.

41:02.900 --> 41:05.004
AND YOU JUST GOT A COMPULSION
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

41:05.110 --> 41:06.691
TO MAKE SURE THAT
THE MIC CABLE WILL WORK?

41:06.800 --> 41:10.076
WHAT'S THE URGENCY
OF THIS MIC CABLE?

41:12.120 --> 41:17.148
- BECAUSE THE BANK CALLED
AND THE LOAN CAME THROUGH.

41:17.260 --> 41:20.229
[sighs]

41:20.330 --> 41:24.471
- [laughs]

41:24.580 --> 41:27.469
FOR REAL?

41:27.580 --> 41:30.549
- BROTHER, WE ARE
OFFICIALLY IN BUSINESS.

41:30.660 --> 41:33.447

[drumming]
