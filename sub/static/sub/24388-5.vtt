[Boss Baby] Next item,
the Little Dumpling Pageant.

01:07.400 --> 01:10.070
Baby Corp runs
the Little Dumpling Pageant?

01:10.361 --> 01:11.946
No. That's exactly the problem.

01:12.030 --> 01:16.367
May I infer from that voluminous spit take
that you're a fan of the pageant?

01:16.451 --> 01:18.244
I wouldn't say I'm a fan.

01:18.328 --> 01:23.249
More like a former winner and champion.
But I don't like to brag about it.

01:23.374 --> 01:25.752
So, what's up?
Something wrong with the pageant?

01:25.835 --> 01:27.378
The pageant itself, no.

01:27.462 --> 01:31.049
Little Dumpling is the crown jewel
of the baby pageant circuit.

01:31.132 --> 01:34.177
A whole town coming together
to celebrate its cutest baby?

01:34.260 --> 01:36.554
That's solid gold dynamite for baby love!

01:36.638 --> 01:38.556
Look at these historical charts!

01:38.640 --> 01:41.559
-Outstanding charts, sir!
-What am I looking at?

01:41.643 --> 01:43.520
Doesn't matter. It's the past, garbage!

01:43.603 --> 01:46.815
Because the problem
is our reigning Little Dumpling champion,

01:46.898 --> 01:48.441
last year's winner...

01:48.525 --> 01:52.112
Jarreau McIntosh. [spits]

01:52.695 --> 01:55.406
You really are super into this pageant,
aren't you?

01:55.490 --> 01:56.991
I care about honor.

01:57.075 --> 02:00.995
That crown used to mean something
when I was a champion, which I was,

02:01.079 --> 02:04.374
-but I don't like to brag about it.
-Yes, Jarreau McIntosh.

02:04.958 --> 02:07.252
Please refer to slide one in your dossier.

02:07.836 --> 02:11.214
[Boss Baby] Cute, sure, but Jarreau really
killed it in the talent competition.

02:11.673 --> 02:12.715
Pot-and-pan drumming.

02:12.799 --> 02:16.469
He could bang those wooden spoons
like Zeus slinging lightning from Olympus.

02:16.553 --> 02:18.096
[Jimbo] I got his poster.

02:18.179 --> 02:22.600
We all got his poster, Jimbo.
And then the wheels fell off the tricycle.

02:22.684 --> 02:26.271
Next slides. Jarreau wasn't cut out
to be a Little Dumpling winner.

02:26.479 --> 02:29.566
When he put on that crown, the fame
went straight to his cherubic head.

02:29.816 --> 02:33.862
He's an embarrassment to baby-kind.
I can't even look. Stop clicking! Stop it!

02:34.362 --> 02:35.905
[sighs] Bottom line,

02:35.989 --> 02:39.450
we can't let another Jarreau McIntosh
win the pageant this year.

02:39.534 --> 02:42.704
Sir, couldn't we just shut
this thing down?

02:42.787 --> 02:48.376
Cutest dimple, softest bottom. How do you
even decide who wins something like that?

02:48.459 --> 02:50.795
Competition is what made
this country great, Staci.

02:50.879 --> 02:54.549
Exactly. So why not do it
like we did in day care?

02:54.632 --> 02:58.595
Twenty babies crawl into the ball pit,
one crawls out.

02:58.678 --> 03:04.100
Come get some, Brayden! [grunting]

03:04.934 --> 03:07.312
Thank you
for considering my proposal, sir.

03:08.813 --> 03:12.317
We're not shutting the pageant down
for some bare-knuckle baby free-for-all.

03:12.692 --> 03:17.363
We just need to make sure this year's
winner is someone Baby Corp can trust.

03:17.447 --> 03:20.575
A ringer from our very own field team.

03:20.658 --> 03:22.201
Oh, I, uh... [chuckles]

03:22.285 --> 03:25.872
I know I'm a proven champion,
but do they let non-babies enter?

03:25.955 --> 03:28.958
Move out of the way.
You're blocking Jimbo. It's Jimbo.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.960
-Our ringer is Jimbo.
-Yay!

03:31.044 --> 03:33.296
Oh, sure. That makes sense.

03:33.379 --> 03:35.048
It's a slam dunk.

03:35.131 --> 03:37.634
Look at that specimen
of adorable babyhood.

03:37.717 --> 03:39.052
Thirty-six vertical inches

03:39.135 --> 03:41.262
-of solid plump and snuggles.
-[giggling]

03:41.346 --> 03:44.724
Most importantly, someone who knows
how a baby should behave.

03:44.807 --> 03:46.309
Say something inspiring, Jimbo.

03:46.809 --> 03:52.398
-Marbles go in hands, not in noses.
-See? He's a role model.

03:52.482 --> 03:56.361
-I'm gonna be like Jarreau McIntosh.
-Oh! No, not like Jarreau!

03:56.444 --> 03:59.989
The exact opposite of Jarreau!
We literally just talked about this!

04:00.073 --> 04:02.492
[sneezes, sniffles]

04:02.575 --> 04:05.119
-[chuckles]
-It's a solid plan. He'll be fine.

04:05.203 --> 04:06.412
Let's hit that pageant!

04:07.288 --> 04:09.082
[chattering]

04:15.546 --> 04:19.634
Why does your brother look like Halloween
just threw up on his face?

04:19.717 --> 04:21.636
You want someone to recognize me?

04:21.719 --> 04:24.639
My famousness could blow
this whole operation.

04:24.722 --> 04:27.850
I like the enthusiasm, Templeton.
Registration table's over there.

04:31.312 --> 04:33.773
-Ooh, snacks!
-Good thinking, Jimbo.

04:33.856 --> 04:38.236
Plump up those jiggly, giggly tummy rolls.
We'll scout the competition.

04:38.319 --> 04:39.445
[sputters]

04:39.529 --> 04:41.656
Wipe yourself off.
You're embarrassing us all.

04:41.739 --> 04:43.616
I don't get this.

04:43.700 --> 04:46.828
Babies just act like babies,
and some judge says,

04:46.911 --> 04:48.955
"Uh, this one's the winner"?

04:49.038 --> 04:53.751
Jimbo's got this in the bag. [chuckles]
That one thinks his toes are food.

04:55.545 --> 04:59.132
[gasps] Whoa! We have a contender.

04:59.215 --> 05:01.843
That's the booger-free princess to beat.

05:01.926 --> 05:04.929
-You can say that again.
-I never repeat myself.

05:05.013 --> 05:06.806

05:17.900 --> 05:20.862
Jarreau McIntosh. [spits]

05:20.945 --> 05:23.072
-He's an actual train wreck.
-Come on.

05:23.156 --> 05:26.617
Let's talk strategy. The sooner
they pass that crown to a new champion,

05:26.701 --> 05:33.249
-the sooner my migraine goes away.
-[gasps] It's him! [chuckling]

05:37.378 --> 05:39.338
Jarreau! [chuckling]

05:39.422 --> 05:43.384
I love your drumming. It's so loud.

05:43.468 --> 05:45.261
[coos, sputters]

05:45.344 --> 05:47.388
Me? Be your bodyguard?

05:47.472 --> 05:48.598
[coos, giggles]

05:48.681 --> 05:50.600
With you?

05:50.683 --> 05:53.853
Yes, I would love to get out of here!

05:54.812 --> 05:56.647
-Huh?
-[mimics deeper voice] Adult hello.

05:56.731 --> 05:59.400
[chuckles] Aren't you just adorable?

05:59.484 --> 06:02.361
[chuckles]
Not like a former pageant winner.

06:02.445 --> 06:05.156
Nope. I'm just here
to register my son, Jimbo.

06:05.239 --> 06:08.201
Okey-doke... sir. Last name?

06:08.951 --> 06:12.538
-Jimbosdad?
-Uh-huh. And how would I spell that?

06:12.622 --> 06:13.873
Uh...

06:13.956 --> 06:17.585
-J... imbo mustache boomerang!
-[screams]

06:21.380 --> 06:24.425
Solid work, kid. Jimbo, it's showtime.

06:24.509 --> 06:27.386
-Uh... Jimbo? [gasps]
-[train horn blowing]

06:27.470 --> 06:29.305
[babies cooing]

06:29.388 --> 06:31.265
-Choo-choo!
-[chuckles]

06:32.934 --> 06:34.685
[Staci] Jimbo's leaving with Jarreau!

06:34.769 --> 06:37.814
No. No, no, no!
They're about to start the pageant!

06:37.897 --> 06:41.025
[sighs] Jarreau McIntosh.

06:41.109 --> 06:43.986
Templeton, you want to salvage
the dignity of this pageant?

06:44.070 --> 06:45.404
More than anything ever.

06:45.488 --> 06:48.449
They literally can't crown a new winner
without the crown.

06:48.533 --> 06:51.452
-What new winner? Jimbo's gone too.
-Forget Jimbo.

06:51.536 --> 06:54.747
Looks like I'm gonna have to win
this pageant myself...

06:55.248 --> 06:56.541
-by delegating.
-Whoa!

06:56.624 --> 06:58.167
-[yells, grunts]
-[babies babble]

06:58.251 --> 07:02.046
Get that crown back, Templeton,
by any means necessary.

On it!

07:07.844 --> 07:10.304
Thank you, thank you. [laughs]

07:10.388 --> 07:12.807
Oh, please, stop.
We're here for the babies.

07:12.890 --> 07:16.561
They are the future. But not the present.
The present's still me.

07:16.644 --> 07:20.481
Marsha Krinkle, Channel 8 News.
You all know me. Am I right?

07:20.565 --> 07:22.400
I'm on billboards on the highway.

07:22.483 --> 07:25.486
[laughing] But enough about me
for a few minutes.

07:25.570 --> 07:31.409
Let's crown this year's Little Dumpling!
Come on! Yeah!

07:31.492 --> 07:34.328
Let's see which of these happy,
bouncing babies

07:34.412 --> 07:36.289
isn't attractive enough to continue.

07:36.372 --> 07:38.833
My money's on you, overbite.

Come on, Staci. Pull it together.

08:01.772 --> 08:03.024
[giggles]

08:03.566 --> 08:05.193
Second rounder.

08:06.611 --> 08:10.323
Well, it ain't much,
but it's a step up from that kid.

08:10.406 --> 08:12.283
[gurgles]

08:13.576 --> 08:14.952
[buzzing]

08:15.536 --> 08:18.873
As a reminder,
all babies are beautiful in their own way.

08:18.956 --> 08:21.417
There are some we don't want
to look at anymore.

08:21.501 --> 08:24.545
-The rest of you are moving on!
-[audience cheering]

08:25.838 --> 08:28.841
[man] Wonderful! Congratulations!
You can still go to college.

08:31.302 --> 08:33.429
Better get your head in the game, Stace.

08:33.513 --> 08:36.599
You were one snot-blowing overbite kid
away from elimination.

08:36.682 --> 08:39.685
-You won't get that lucky again.
-Sir, I told you,

08:39.769 --> 08:42.188
-I don't even like this pageant!
-[monitor beeps]

08:42.271 --> 08:44.982
I need to requisition
a makeover specialist, priority one.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.903
Since when are you make-up specialists?

08:48.986 --> 08:52.156
-We got a promotion.
-I draw pictures.

08:52.240 --> 08:53.991
Makeover attack!

08:54.075 --> 08:56.536
[grunting]

08:58.037 --> 08:58.871
Huh?

Hmm...

-[rock music playing]
-[cooing]

09:17.014 --> 09:21.352
We have a new plan. I'm going to take
Jarreau's crown, and then-- Ow!

09:21.435 --> 09:24.647
-Sorry.
-That's okay. I just... Hey!

09:24.730 --> 09:27.525
I meant, sorry,
you can't take Jarreau's crown.

09:27.608 --> 09:29.318
-I'm his bodyguard.
-What?

09:29.402 --> 09:33.823
Don't worry, Jarreau. [grunts]
I will never let anyone hurt you.

09:35.366 --> 09:38.119
-Hi!
-I'm not trying to hurt Jarreau.

09:38.202 --> 09:43.249
But if you take his crown,
he is gonna hurt, on the inside.

09:44.500 --> 09:46.836
Give it! [growling]

09:46.919 --> 09:50.006
[grunts, groans]

09:51.048 --> 09:54.051
[both grunting]

09:54.135 --> 09:55.011
What the...?

10:05.688 --> 10:07.106
Run, Jarreau!

10:08.149 --> 10:12.403
-[grunting] Oof!
-[Jimbo] Sorry, Tim. I'm so sorry!

10:13.946 --> 10:16.365

[Staci] Ow! Ow! Ow!

10:18.909 --> 10:22.121
-Ta-da!
-[gasps] You're a vision.

10:22.788 --> 10:25.499
-[shrieks]
-Um, maybe lose the stickers.

10:25.583 --> 10:27.084
[all groan]

10:27.168 --> 10:28.919
[Staci screaming]

10:29.003 --> 10:34.425
-All right. Feel like a winner yet?
-Sir, I am a winner. I like to win.

10:34.508 --> 10:39.388
Put me in a ball pit, and I will crawl out
right over Brayden's stupid face!

10:39.472 --> 10:41.182
Give the executive summary.
Clock's ticking.

10:41.265 --> 10:45.102
How am I supposed to win something
that's totally pointless?

10:45.186 --> 10:48.314
Pointless? The point is baby love.

10:48.397 --> 10:49.607
Win this pageant,

10:49.690 --> 10:52.693
and you're the new face of babies
everywhere.

10:52.777 --> 10:55.905
We need you, Staci.
Your company needs you.

10:56.614 --> 11:00.326
Now, get out there
and you find the way to win.

-[babies cooing]
-[audience] Aw!

11:04.413 --> 11:08.250
Ha! They think their reflection
is another baby.

Isn't that just so simple
and precious, folks?

11:12.838 --> 11:16.634
-[all] Aw!
-Take a good look while you can, kids.

one more baby goes down.

Yes! Another lucky break.

someone check and see if that baby's okay.

-That crown is all he's got.
-But we need it.

-We're supposed to be fixing the pageant.
-We need to fix Jarreau.

12:14.233 --> 12:16.735
He's a broken baby. If he felt better,

12:16.819 --> 12:22.158
-I bet he'd give you the crown.
-[sighs] Fine. How do we fix Jarreau?

[blabbers incoherently]

12:28.247 --> 12:33.335
-That's it. Let out all your feelings.
-You know I don't speak baby, right?

12:33.419 --> 12:36.088
-I can translate.

[Jimbo] "I guess maybe
it all went wrong right after the pageant.

12:39.842 --> 12:43.345
Mommy and Daddy bought me a new toy
as a reward for winning.

12:43.596 --> 12:47.224
It was real shiny,
with a hand crank on the side.

12:47.308 --> 12:49.685
I turned the crank... and bang!"

you know?"

[blabbers incoherently]

13:00.529 --> 13:03.699
"I'm not a bad baby. Just scared."

13:03.782 --> 13:05.034
He said all that?

13:05.117 --> 13:08.204
-I added some color.
-[blabbering continues]

13:08.287 --> 13:11.832
Stupid jack-in-the-box.
I wish I could show it what's what.

13:13.417 --> 13:16.712
[gasps] I think I know
how to help him give up that crown.

13:17.713 --> 13:21.300
This next round will test how cute
these little nuggets can be

13:21.383 --> 13:23.302
when faced with the unexpected.

13:23.385 --> 13:25.137
A sour lemon.

13:25.221 --> 13:30.434
Or, as they say in Sweden, a "sur citron."
I know facts. I'm a journalist.

13:30.518 --> 13:32.186

14:27.032 --> 14:28.951
Only three babies left.

14:29.034 --> 14:32.454
Let's see what they're made of
in the dancing competition.

14:32.538 --> 14:37.376
I was a triple threat back
in my sorority days. Dancing and math.

14:37.459 --> 14:39.920

-Why are they doing this?

14:45.801 --> 14:47.553
-[monitor beeping]
-[gasps]

14:48.095 --> 14:51.223
It's backfiring. The crowd is turning.
We're losing baby love.

14:51.307 --> 14:55.019
And another one bites the dust.

14:55.102 --> 14:56.520
Uh... oh.

14:56.604 --> 14:59.231
[cooing, giggling]

14:59.815 --> 15:02.318
[whispering] You're next.

15:05.279 --> 15:07.990
-Staci.
-[fingers cracking]

15:08.073 --> 15:09.992
Hey, I'm standing right here.

15:11.577 --> 15:16.165
-Sorry, didn't see ya.
-You're not exactly helping the cause.

15:16.248 --> 15:19.835
The whole point of this pageant
is to make people love babies.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.086
Sir, you told me

15:21.170 --> 15:25.758
I had to find a way to win, so I did,
by making everyone else lose.

15:25.841 --> 15:27.843
You're worse than Jarreau McIntosh!

15:28.552 --> 15:31.138
I am a winner! [grunting]

15:33.641 --> 15:35.100
Staci!

15:36.226 --> 15:39.271
Plan B is a disaster. We need a plan C.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.482
-Whoa!
-[crashes]

15:42.066 --> 15:44.777
Uh... maybe we let plan B ride it out.

15:46.862 --> 15:48.113
[blabbering]

15:48.197 --> 15:50.574
Is this a good idea?

15:50.658 --> 15:54.787
If he can stand up to my jack-in-the-box,
he can conquer his fears.

15:54.870 --> 15:57.831
Then he'll be all better
and give us the crown, right?

15:58.457 --> 15:59.792
-[giggling]
-[music playing]

15:59.875 --> 16:06.590
Easy. Don't get scared all over again.
[screaming]

16:06.674 --> 16:08.676
[giggling]

16:08.759 --> 16:11.178
He's not scared anymore.
Let's get that crown.

16:12.680 --> 16:14.014
What now?

16:15.307 --> 16:19.395
-[music playing]
-[giggling, blabbering]

16:20.562 --> 16:23.857
I don't wanna say
this is what he just said, but...

16:23.941 --> 16:28.153
it's possible the story was fake
and he just wanted a free jack-in-the-box.

16:28.237 --> 16:31.573
[groans] Jarreau McIntosh, that is it!

16:31.657 --> 16:34.576
Hold him down, Jimbo!
We are taking that crown!

16:35.160 --> 16:38.414
It's not his fault!
He was a simple drummer!

16:38.497 --> 16:42.001
He was unprepared
for this go-go celebrity lifestyle!

16:42.084 --> 16:45.921
I was a baby when I won,
and I handled it fine. Look.

16:46.005 --> 16:48.757
I'll show you
what a winner's supposed to be like.

16:48.841 --> 16:52.636
Mom and Dad must've taken tons
of photos of my victory tour.

16:52.720 --> 16:57.182
All the ceremonies and ribbon-cuttings.

17:00.853 --> 17:03.647
-Hang on, I'll be right back.
-[dishes clattering]

17:03.731 --> 17:06.734
-Hey, Timbo.
-Your baby brother still down for his nap?

17:06.817 --> 17:10.112
Sure. Anyway, for no reason,
I was looking at my photo albums.

17:10.195 --> 17:12.239
I can't find any pictures of when I won

17:12.322 --> 17:15.451
-the Little Dumpling Pageant.
-Oh, Timmy,

17:15.534 --> 17:18.245
I'm surprised you even remember us
telling you that.

17:18.328 --> 17:20.497
-Total lie, by the way.
-What?

17:20.581 --> 17:23.250
Oh, yeah. You never even made it out
of the first round.

17:24.668 --> 17:26.462
-You were so excited.
-[baby burps]

17:26.545 --> 17:30.340
You kept gulping down bottle
after bottle after bottle.

17:30.424 --> 17:32.926
And when you toddled out on that stage...

17:33.761 --> 17:37.264
-it all came back up.
-[stomach rumbling]

17:37.347 --> 17:39.266
-[Tim vomiting]
-[all gasp]

17:39.349 --> 17:41.935
They called you "Spit-uppleton."

17:42.019 --> 17:44.938
[both laugh]

17:45.022 --> 17:49.443
Oh, pretty funny name. But also, cruel.

17:49.526 --> 17:52.321
-Pageant parents are monsters.
-We didn't want it to scar you,

17:52.404 --> 17:55.866
so we called you
our own champion Little Dumpling.

17:55.949 --> 18:00.037
-Even made you a tiny toilet paper crown.
-Why would you do that?

18:00.120 --> 18:04.833
-I've been living a lie!
-Sorry, Tim. I guess we're your parents.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.210
No matter what happens,

18:06.293 --> 18:09.880
we want you to feel like a winner
because you are a winner.

18:09.963 --> 18:13.050
[chuckles] I mean, not in the pageant,
obviously. [mimics vomiting]

18:13.133 --> 18:18.013
[laughs] Just more of being
the best Tim Templeton in the whole world.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.973
-I gotta go.
-My spoon!

-[music playing]

18:23.852 --> 18:26.271
Jarreau,
I've learned in the last few minutes

18:26.355 --> 18:27.856
that the crown doesn't mean anything.

18:27.940 --> 18:31.568
What matters is what makes you
feel like a winner. So...

18:31.652 --> 18:34.696
what makes Jarreau McIntosh
feel like a winner?

18:34.780 --> 18:36.406
[blabbers]

18:39.576 --> 18:42.871
-[rock music playing]
-[giggling]

18:42.955 --> 18:44.331
What do you say?

18:44.414 --> 18:47.126
-Ready to pass on that crown?
-[coos]

18:47.209 --> 18:49.586
-[laughs]
-Take care of Jarreau.

18:49.670 --> 18:53.465
-I'll run the crown back.
-[Marsha] It's the final finger paint-off!

18:53.549 --> 18:57.970
Can you feel the excitement
and lack of actual artistic talent, folks?

18:59.429 --> 19:02.141
-We got the crown. How's it going?
-Staci's winning,

19:02.224 --> 19:04.059
but she's gone full McIntosh!

19:08.021 --> 19:09.815
[Boss Baby gasps] She's got glue!

19:11.608 --> 19:13.068
Don't do it, Staci.

19:13.152 --> 19:16.446
Staci, freeze!
I know you can hear me, Staci.

19:16.530 --> 19:19.825
I learned several minutes ago
the crown doesn't mean anything.

19:19.908 --> 19:22.619
What matters is what makes you
feel like a winner.

19:26.915 --> 19:28.792
-Good speech.
-I practiced.

19:32.087 --> 19:34.131
She sure is a little something.

19:34.214 --> 19:37.134

19:51.523 --> 19:53.442
[man] This pageant is the worst!

19:53.525 --> 19:56.820
I can't be expected to reward this, right?
Judges?

19:56.904 --> 20:00.782
-[man] Nah.
-Right on. Well, I think we can all agree,

20:00.866 --> 20:03.327
if there's one thing we've learned
from this pageant,

20:03.410 --> 20:07.206
it's that babies are disgusting, clumsy,
mucus-filled disasters.

20:07.497 --> 20:11.418
But I guess this girl in the tutu
is somehow the least disgusting.

20:11.501 --> 20:12.920
Probably. Whatever.

20:13.003 --> 20:15.839
So, by default,
your Little Dumpling winner is...

20:17.049 --> 20:20.594
Uh... Jimbo... Jimbosdad!

20:20.677 --> 20:21.970
[audience murmuring]

20:22.054 --> 20:25.849
Okay, then.
Do we have a crown for this kid?

20:32.231 --> 20:34.858
No, no, no, no, no! [gasps]

20:37.444 --> 20:39.446

20:41.615 --> 20:43.700

-Don't make it worse, Staci.

20:46.828 --> 20:48.413
Honey, call the police.

21:13.939 --> 21:16.858
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

21:16.942 --> 21:20.028
Brilliant, Staci!
I've never felt so much baby love.

21:20.112 --> 21:21.446
This couldn't get any better.

21:24.199 --> 21:27.494

21:31.498 --> 21:37.713
It's Jarreau McIntosh! [screams, laughs]

21:38.171 --> 21:40.841
Why did we ever make babies compete
against each other?

21:40.924 --> 21:43.802
We're awful! This pageant is awful!

21:43.885 --> 21:47.597
By the power vested in me
as a celebrity with a microphone,

21:47.681 --> 21:51.518
I hereby declare this pageant
canceled forever.

21:51.601 --> 21:55.689
All babies are winners.
Or, at least, most. Some.

21:55.772 --> 21:59.109
Jimbo, you've proven that you can
never be left unsupervised.

21:59.192 --> 22:03.780
-Yay! I will always have a friend.
-Templeton, on the other hand,

22:03.864 --> 22:06.074
-way to drive it home.
-[chuckles]

I'm sorry, did I hear you say,
"Tim saved the day"?

22:09.745 --> 22:12.914
Well, Tim and whatever brought on
your emotional 180.

22:12.998 --> 22:17.169
Honestly, Staci, I've never seen you
display so much heart. Or any.

22:17.252 --> 22:18.378
Pssh!

22:18.462 --> 22:23.508
What heart? I told you I wanted
the pageant shut down, and I shut it down.

22:25.635 --> 22:29.806
Don't... ever... cross... me!

22:30.474 --> 22:33.477
Next year, bare-knuckle baby free-for-all!

22:33.560 --> 22:35.645
Ring the bell, Brayden!
