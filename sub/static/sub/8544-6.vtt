13:26.109 --> 13:28.285
YOU DON'T THINK I'M RED JOHN,
DO YOU?

13:30.853 --> 13:32.507
YOU DO, DON'T YOU?

13:34.552 --> 13:36.293
TELL YOU WHAT.

13:36.337 --> 13:37.773
YOU WANT TO QUESTION ME,
YOU ARREST ME.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.296
OTHERWISE, YOU LEAVE ME
THE HELL OUT OF THIS.

13:39.340 --> 13:41.124
SIT DOWN.

13:41.168 --> 13:42.517
SIT.

13:46.913 --> 13:49.959
IF ASKING'S NOT GONNA WORK,
I WON'T ASK.

13:50.003 --> 13:51.700
YOU'RE NO LONGER
WITH THE CBI.

13:51.743 --> 13:54.311
YOU DON'T GET THE SAME
PROTECTION LAW ENFORCEMENT GETS.

13:54.355 --> 13:56.661
WHAT, YOU THREATENING ME?NO, JANE IS.

13:56.705 --> 13:59.316
HE WANTS TO SEE YOU
TOMORROW NIGHT.

13:59.360 --> 14:00.796
[sets down cup]

14:02.537 --> 14:05.192
IF YOU DON'T SHOW UP, HE WILL
ASSUME YOU'RE RED JOHN.

14:05.235 --> 14:08.456
AND, RAY, HE WILL
COME AFTER YOU.

14:08.499 --> 14:11.459
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

14:11.502 --> 14:13.853
YOU KNOW JANE.
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM.

14:13.896 --> 14:17.160
YOU KNOW WHAT RED JOHN
DID TO HIM.

14:17.204 --> 14:19.467
IF I WERE YOU,
I WOULDN'T TEST HIM.

14:19.510 --> 14:22.165
I'M NOT AFRAID
OF PATRICK JANE.

14:22.209 --> 14:23.514
WELL, WHAT'S THE PROBLEM
WITH SHOWING UP?

14:26.735 --> 14:29.303
IF I DO THIS,
WILL YOU AND JANE DROP

14:29.346 --> 14:31.000
THE WHOLE THAT "I'M RED JOHN"
BUSINESS?

14:31.044 --> 14:33.873
FOR ONCE AND FOR ALL.

14:35.222 --> 14:37.528
WHAT TIME?

14:37.572 --> 14:38.573
8:00.

14:39.748 --> 14:41.750
I'M NOT DONE.

14:43.360 --> 14:45.406
THERE'S ONE MORE THING
THAT I NEED.

14:45.449 --> 14:47.408
[sighs] YOU'RE KILLING ME HERE.

14:49.279 --> 14:51.020
STILES.YEAH?

14:51.064 --> 14:53.022
WHERE IS HE?I CAN'T HELP YOU.

14:53.066 --> 14:58.027
COME ON, RAY, YOU'VE BEEN
WITH VISUALIZE FOR YEARS.

14:58.071 --> 15:00.595
I DON'T WANT TO ARREST HIM.
I JUST WANT TO TALK TO HIM.

15:02.423 --> 15:04.860
YOU DO THIS,
AND I WILL OWE YOU.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.862
AND IN YOUR LINE OF WORK,
SOONER OR LATER

15:06.906 --> 15:08.429
YOU'RE GONNA NEED A FAVOR.

15:12.389 --> 15:13.913
SO RAY HAFFNER TOLD ME
THAT STILES USES

15:13.956 --> 15:16.219
A PRIVATE JET TO MOVE AROUND
THE COUNTRY UNDETECTED.

15:16.263 --> 15:19.396
BELONGS TO A GUY
NAMED RYAN PARKS.

15:19.440 --> 15:21.398
PARKS. GOT IT.
I'LL CHECK IT OUT.

15:21.442 --> 15:23.270
HAS JANE BEEN IN YET?

15:23.313 --> 15:25.402
NO, I HAVEN'T HEARD
FROM HIM.

15:35.847 --> 15:36.936
[knocks on door]

15:46.815 --> 15:49.557
[speaking inaudibly][engines whirring]

15:49.600 --> 15:51.124
MR. LAMOTTE?

15:51.167 --> 15:53.474
YEAH? CAN I HELP YOU?

15:53.517 --> 15:55.389
AGENTS CHO AND RIGSBY
FROM THE CBI.

15:55.432 --> 15:57.478
WE WERE WONDERING IF YOU COULD
ANSWER A FEW QUESTIONS FOR US.

15:57.521 --> 15:58.435
SURE.

15:58.479 --> 16:00.220
A G6 LANDED HERE
LATE LAST NIGHT,

16:00.263 --> 16:02.091
TAIL NUMBER N550MT.

16:02.135 --> 16:03.745
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
AROUND 11:00.

16:03.788 --> 16:05.442
I REMEMBER.
WHAT ABOUT IT?

16:05.486 --> 16:06.748
DO YOU KNOW WHO WAS
ON THE FLIGHT?

16:06.791 --> 16:08.402
NO. PRIVATE AIRCRAFT
AREN'T REQUIRED

16:08.445 --> 16:10.099
TO PROVIDE PASSENGER MANIFESTS.

16:10.143 --> 16:12.580
DID YOU HAPPEN TO SEE ANYONE
WHO WAS GETTING OFF THE PLANE?

16:12.623 --> 16:14.234
NO. SORRY.

16:14.277 --> 16:16.279
OH, BUT WHOEVER IT WAS HAD
A CAR SERVICE PICK HIM UP.

16:16.323 --> 16:17.846
THEY MIGHT BE ABLE
TO HELP YOU.

16:17.889 --> 16:19.456
YOU DON'T HAPPEN TO HAVE
THE NAME OF THAT CAR SERVICE,

16:19.500 --> 16:21.676
BY ANY CHANCE?

16:23.634 --> 16:25.288
SO WHAT HAPPENED
WITH THE CAR SERVICE?

16:25.332 --> 16:27.116
WELL, THEY SAID THAT THEY
PICKED UP A SILVER-HAIRED MAN

16:27.160 --> 16:29.423
WITH A BRITISH ACCENT
FROM THE AIRPORT LAST NIGHT.

16:29.466 --> 16:30.859
STILES.WE THINK SO.

16:30.902 --> 16:32.121
WELL, WHERE'D HE GO?

16:32.165 --> 16:33.470
THE ADDRESS WAS FOR
THE ECUADORIAN CONSULATE

16:33.514 --> 16:34.776
IN SAN FRANCISCO.

16:34.819 --> 16:38.040
GOOD JOB.
YOU TWO GO AND CHECK IT OUT.

16:38.084 --> 16:40.477
YOU KNOW WHAT? VAN PELT,
WHY DON'T YOU GO ALONE?

16:40.521 --> 16:43.002
STILES LIKES YOU. MAYBE WE CAN
USE THAT TO OUR ADVANTAGE.

16:45.308 --> 16:47.310
IS... THERE A PROBLEM?

16:47.354 --> 16:48.529
UH, NO.NO.

16:51.532 --> 16:53.534
I'LL BE FINE.I KNOW.

16:53.577 --> 16:55.188
IT'S MY JOB.I KNOW.

16:55.231 --> 16:57.320
HEY.

16:57.364 --> 16:58.452
I LOVE YOU.

16:58.495 --> 17:00.976
I KNOW.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.543
[door creaks]

17:03.718 --> 17:06.373
[speaks indistinctly]

17:08.505 --> 17:09.506
[door closes]

17:09.550 --> 17:13.510
[cell phone ringing]

17:13.554 --> 17:15.034
[beep]

17:15.077 --> 17:16.165
HEY, LISBON.

17:16.209 --> 17:17.340
WHERE ARE YOU?

17:17.384 --> 17:18.472
OH, JUST RUNNING
SOME ERRANDS.

17:18.515 --> 17:19.864
Everything okay?

17:19.908 --> 17:21.910
YEAH, RIGHT AS RAIN.
WHAT'S UP?

17:21.953 --> 17:23.172
Haffner's in.

17:23.216 --> 17:25.174
GOOD. WHAT ABOUT STILES?

17:25.218 --> 17:27.002
VAN PELT MAY HAVE A BEAD
ON HIS LOCATION.

17:27.046 --> 17:28.482
SHE'S CHECKING IT OUT NOW.

17:28.525 --> 17:31.659
THAT LEAVES ONE MORE RED JOHN
SUSPECT LEFT TO TALK TO.

17:31.702 --> 17:34.009
YES. BERTRAM.
I'M ON MY WAY TO HIS OFFICE.

17:34.053 --> 17:35.837
YOU WANT TO MEET ME THERE?All right.

17:35.880 --> 17:37.230
[line clicks,
snaps phone shut]

17:41.060 --> 17:43.062
GRACE VAN PELT.

17:43.105 --> 17:45.673
WELL... HOW LOVELY
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

17:45.716 --> 17:46.500
[chuckles]

17:46.543 --> 17:48.545
[kisses twice] MMM. WOW.

17:48.589 --> 17:51.070
WELL... SO, PLEASE SIT.

17:51.113 --> 17:53.550
WHAT DO I OWE THIS PLEASURE?

17:53.594 --> 17:54.725
JANE.

17:54.769 --> 17:56.727
HE NEEDS A FAVOR.

17:56.771 --> 18:00.340
OH. CLEVER, HIM,
SENDING YOU.

18:00.383 --> 18:04.344
SO EXACTLY WHAT CAN I DO
FOR PATRICK JANE?

18:04.387 --> 18:06.520
[exhales] HE WOULD LIKE
TO MEET WITH YOU.

18:06.563 --> 18:08.261
TOMORROW NIGHT AT 8:00.

18:10.654 --> 18:12.743
YOU'VE CHANGED SINCE
WE LAST MET.

18:12.787 --> 18:14.093
YOU'RE MARRIED.

18:14.136 --> 18:15.790
YES.

18:15.833 --> 18:18.619
OH, DON'T TELL ME YOU MARRIED
THAT GENIAL OAF.

18:20.229 --> 18:23.102
OH. OH, WELL. [chuckles]
CONGRATULATIONS.

18:23.145 --> 18:25.365
YEAH.THANK YOU.

18:25.408 --> 18:28.585
SO... WILL YOU MEET
WITH JANE?

18:28.629 --> 18:30.109
AH... YOU KNOW,

18:30.152 --> 18:33.112
NOTHING WOULD PLEASE ME MORE
THAN TO MEET WITH HIM.

18:33.155 --> 18:35.114
I MEAN, REALLY,
I WOULD LOVE TO. BUT...

18:35.157 --> 18:38.726
[inhales sharply] UNFORTUNATELY,
MY CIRCUMSTANCES--

18:38.769 --> 18:41.250
IT'S PROBABLY
NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

18:41.294 --> 18:43.557
YOU MEAN
BECAUSE OF THE F.B.I.?

18:43.600 --> 18:47.300
MM. YOU HAVE BEEN DOING
YOUR HOMEWORK. [chuckles]

18:47.343 --> 18:49.258
THEY DON'T KNOW I'M HERE.AH.

18:49.302 --> 18:51.652
WHICH MEANS THEY DON'T KNOW
YOU'RE HERE.

18:51.695 --> 18:54.307
BUT THEY WILL IF YOU DON'T
AGREE TO MEET WITH JANE.

18:54.350 --> 18:57.484
YOU HAVE CHANGED,
HAVEN'T YOU?

19:00.791 --> 19:03.968
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN
TO ECUADOR, BY ANY CHANCE?

19:04.012 --> 19:06.014
NO.OH.

19:06.057 --> 19:09.670
I WAS THERE--OH, GOD,
YEARS AND YEARSAGO

19:09.713 --> 19:12.629
DOING MISSIONARY WORK.
UH...

19:12.673 --> 19:14.022
LOVELY PEOPLE.

19:14.065 --> 19:15.806
OH, YEAH, BUT-BUT--

19:15.850 --> 19:18.635
THERE WAS A YOUNG MAN
THERE...

19:18.679 --> 19:23.292
HE WAS UNDERPRIVILEGED,
FEROCIOUSLY AMBITIOUS.

19:23.336 --> 19:25.512
I SAW SOMETHING IN HIM.

19:25.555 --> 19:28.689
SO I DECIDED
TO TRY AND HELP HIM.

19:28.732 --> 19:30.473
YOU KNOW, I-I PAID
FOR HIS SCHOOL FEES,

19:30.517 --> 19:31.866
THAT SORT OF THING.

19:31.909 --> 19:33.998
N-NOTHING REALLY MUCH,
BUT WOULDN'T YOU KNOW IT?

19:34.042 --> 19:36.697
ALL THESE YEARS LATER,
THAT SAME MAN

19:36.740 --> 19:38.655
IS NOW MINISTER OF STATE.

19:38.699 --> 19:41.658
I'M HAPPY FOR HIM.

19:41.702 --> 19:44.183
ANYWAY, HE INVITED ME
TO STAY IN THIS

19:44.226 --> 19:46.663
PALATIAL CONSULATE.

19:46.707 --> 19:49.710
THIS MORSEL OF FOREIGN SOIL.

19:49.753 --> 19:52.843
FOREIGN SOIL, WHICH,
AS YOU KNOW,

19:52.887 --> 19:56.282
IS OUTSIDE THE JURISDICTION
OF YOU, THE F.B.I.,

19:56.325 --> 19:59.023
AND ALL U.S. LAW ENFORCEMENT.

19:59.067 --> 20:01.330
SO, YOU SEE, GRACIE,
YOUR IDLE THREATS

20:01.374 --> 20:02.679
ARE JUST THAT.

20:02.723 --> 20:05.334
WELL, IT'S BEEN SO LOVELY
SEEING YOU AGAIN.

20:05.378 --> 20:07.467
[clears throat]PLEASE GIVE MY BEST
TO MR. JANE.

20:07.510 --> 20:10.209
[chuckles] CLOSE THE DOOR
ON YOUR WAY OUT!

20:10.252 --> 20:13.342
[chuckles]

20:16.345 --> 20:17.999
IT'S GONNA BE FINE.

20:18.042 --> 20:19.870
THANKS.
I FEEL A LOT BETTER.

20:19.914 --> 20:21.002
[knocks on door]

20:21.045 --> 20:22.743
COME ON IN.

20:26.399 --> 20:28.531
WE'VE MADE
A BREAKTHROUGH, SIR.

20:28.575 --> 20:29.750
IN...

20:29.793 --> 20:31.360
THE RED JOHN CASE.

20:31.404 --> 20:34.015
WE'RE CLOSE
TO IDENTIFYING HIM.

20:34.058 --> 20:36.713
WELL, THEN THIS IS
FANTASTIC NEWS.

20:36.757 --> 20:38.498
[chuckles] AFTER ALL THESE
YEARS. Y-YOU--

20:38.541 --> 20:40.064
YOU REALLY THINK
YOU'VE GOT HIM?

20:40.108 --> 20:41.718
I DO.

20:42.893 --> 20:45.679
I'LL KNOW THE SECOND YOU
HAVE SOMETHING CONCRETE.

20:45.722 --> 20:46.941
YOU WILL, SIR.

20:46.984 --> 20:48.725
AND I WANT TO BE THERE
WHEN YOU END THIS.

20:48.769 --> 20:50.771
I WAS HOPING YOU'D SAY THAT.

21:11.400 --> 21:16.275
[whistling]

21:16.318 --> 21:19.582
[continues whistling]

21:19.626 --> 21:22.150
[dialing]

21:22.193 --> 21:24.326
[continues whistling]

21:24.370 --> 21:26.937
YEAH, IT'S ME.

21:26.981 --> 21:31.855
I JUST HAD A VERY INTERESTING
CONVERSATION WITH PATRICK JANE.

21:32.987 --> 21:34.467
HOW'D IT GO WITH BERTRAM?

21:34.510 --> 21:36.295
HE'S IN.
WHAT ABOUT STILES?

21:36.338 --> 21:37.948
NOT SO GOOD.DID YOU FIND HIM?

21:37.992 --> 21:39.559
YES. [exhales]

21:39.602 --> 21:42.083
THEN WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?MM.

21:42.126 --> 21:43.954
HE'S AT
THE ECUADORIAN CONSULATE.

21:43.998 --> 21:46.653
AS LONG AS HE'S THERE,
WE CAN'T TOUCH HIM.

21:47.871 --> 21:49.786
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

21:49.830 --> 21:51.614
I'LL HANDLE STILES.

21:51.658 --> 21:53.964
HE'S NOT GONNA COME WITH YOU.
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO.

21:54.008 --> 21:55.792
I'LL BE PERSUASIVE.

21:57.794 --> 21:59.492
WHAT IS THAT?

22:02.669 --> 22:04.888
[exhales]

22:09.371 --> 22:10.938
[closes tube]

22:10.981 --> 22:12.983
YOU SURE IT'S BIG ENOUGH?

22:17.814 --> 22:20.121
WE NEED TO TALK
ABOUT TOMORROW NIGHT.

22:20.164 --> 22:21.209
I'VE ALREADY TOLD YOU.

22:21.252 --> 22:23.037
JUST HEAR ME OUT, PLEASE.

22:24.865 --> 22:25.996
YOU DON'T WANT ME
TO BE THERE.

22:26.040 --> 22:28.477
NO, I DON'T.

22:28.521 --> 22:30.479
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE THERE
BECAUSE YOU THINK

22:30.523 --> 22:33.656
I'M GONNA TRY AND STOP YOU
FROM KILLING RED JOHN.

22:33.700 --> 22:35.310
ARE YOU SAYING
THAT YOU WON'T?

22:35.354 --> 22:38.139
WHAT I'M SAYING IS
SOME MEN--

22:38.182 --> 22:39.793
MEN LIKE RED JOHN--

22:39.836 --> 22:43.797
THEY DON'T DESERVE A TRIAL.
THEY DON'T DESERVE A JURY.

22:43.840 --> 22:46.843
THEY DESERVE WHAT THEY HAVE
COMING TO THEM.

22:46.887 --> 22:48.497
WAIT, L-LET ME GET THIS
STRAIGHT.

22:48.541 --> 22:51.370
AFTER CLOSE TO 20 YEARS
WORKING IN LAW ENFORCEMENT,

22:51.413 --> 22:53.807
YOU'RE JUST--
YOU'RE CHANGING YOUR MIND?

22:53.850 --> 22:55.722
ABOUT RED JOHN? YES.

22:56.897 --> 22:59.856
I'M SURPRISED, LISBON.

22:59.900 --> 23:02.816
WHAT, YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME?

23:02.859 --> 23:04.208
HEAVENS, NO.

23:04.252 --> 23:05.993
YOU'RE THE MOST HONEST
PERSON I KNOW.

23:06.036 --> 23:08.996
YOU WOULD NEVER LIE,
NOT ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

23:09.039 --> 23:11.520
RIGHT?

23:11.564 --> 23:13.000
RIGHT.

23:13.043 --> 23:15.394
TOMORROW NIGHT THEN.

23:15.437 --> 23:17.091
TOMORROW NIGHT.

23:23.097 --> 23:28.668
[door closes]

23:41.332 --> 23:43.247
PATRICK, DEAR BOY.

23:43.291 --> 23:44.945
WELL, HOW ARE YOU?

23:44.988 --> 23:47.861
WELL, I'M NOT YOUR BOY.

23:47.904 --> 23:52.082
OH, I SEE. SO THIS IS
NOT A SOCIAL MEETING, EH?

23:52.126 --> 23:55.259
YOU'RE GONNA MEET ME
TONIGHT AT 8:00.

23:56.478 --> 23:58.524
PATRICK--NO, YOU LISTEN TO ME.

23:58.567 --> 24:01.091
YOU'RE GONNA MEET ME
TONIGHT AT 8:00,

24:01.135 --> 24:03.050
OR I'M GONNA COME BACK HERE,
AND WHEN I DO,

24:03.093 --> 24:06.270
YOU WILL NEED MORE THAN THESE
WALLS TO KEEP YOU SAFE.

24:06.314 --> 24:08.098
THREATS?

24:08.142 --> 24:10.536
OH. THAT'S SO
OUT OF CHARACTER.

24:10.579 --> 24:12.407
I MEAN EVERY WORD OF IT.

24:12.451 --> 24:14.322
YES.

24:14.365 --> 24:18.108
I BELIEVE YOU DO.

24:18.152 --> 24:20.894
BUT YOU SEE, PATRICK,

24:20.937 --> 24:23.984
