I'm just being thorough.

Cancer treatment during pregnancy

There's an absence of clinical trials

01:27.437 --> 01:29.638
and very little information
on long-term outlook.

01:29.739 --> 01:31.406

Uh, no, no, not at all, Dr. Lin.

01:37.995 --> 01:40.031
Uh, your research pitch sounds awesome.

01:40.081 --> 01:41.215
I think you're a shoo-in
for fellow of the year.

01:41.317 --> 01:42.283
He had a late night.

01:42.385 --> 01:44.218
I did. Because I'm single...

What happened to you two?

02:03.839 --> 02:06.606
When you arrived, you were hungry and driven

02:06.709 --> 02:08.809
and just dying to show
me what you were made of.

02:08.911 --> 02:11.078
And now you... you're
yawning like a narcoleptic,

02:11.180 --> 02:13.013
and you're eye-humping Dr. Bishop so hard

02:13.115 --> 02:14.781

02:14.883 --> 02:16.049
Dr. Lin!

I just don't want you
to waste the opportunity

02:18.420 --> 02:19.485
that you've been given.

02:19.588 --> 02:20.854
Having fun and enjoying life

02:20.956 --> 02:22.722
is not going to make us bad doctors.

02:22.824 --> 02:26.092
It's not going to make you
the best doctor, either.

02:28.530 --> 02:29.995
Okay, Mr. Sandhu's hip replacement

02:30.098 --> 02:31.097
is at the end of the day,

02:31.199 --> 02:32.765
so you should go see him around noon.

02:32.867 --> 02:34.133
That'll calm him down a bit.

02:34.236 --> 02:36.102
Okay, well, I won't let you down,
Dr. Harris.

02:36.204 --> 02:36.936
Do I look worried?

02:37.038 --> 02:38.337
Actually, yes, you do.

02:38.439 --> 02:40.106
Well, I'm not about my patients.

02:40.208 --> 02:41.273
They're in good hands.

02:41.375 --> 02:42.441
Thank you, Dr. Harris.

02:42.543 --> 02:43.709
Oh, and good luck today.

02:43.811 --> 02:45.444
Thank you.

02:45.546 --> 02:47.813
- Charlie.
- Dawn, please don't ask me if I'm ready.

02:47.915 --> 02:49.581
I always want to say I was born ready,
and then we'll both be

02:49.683 --> 02:51.483

02:51.585 --> 02:53.953
you have always had a knack
for lightening the mood.

03:00.160 --> 03:01.893
It's in my stomach, not my chest.

I haven't eaten since yesterday,

03:03.797 --> 03:05.397
and my appetite's on steroids.

03:05.499 --> 03:07.733
Well, I will bring you a bacon cheeseburger

03:07.834 --> 03:09.033
as soon as you're clear.

03:09.136 --> 03:11.569
As a cardiac surgeon,
I wouldn't recommend that.

03:11.671 --> 03:13.122
See, that's why our
marriage didn't work, Dawn.

03:13.172 --> 03:15.173
You have no respect for bacon.

You won't have a problem
with the anesthesia.

03:21.081 --> 03:22.313
You're in excellent health.

03:22.415 --> 03:24.182
Please explain that to my brain tumor.

03:24.284 --> 03:25.817
Which will be a distant
memory as of noon today.

03:25.919 --> 03:28.319
You have my stamp of approval.

03:28.421 --> 03:29.887
- Charlie?
- Hmm?

03:29.989 --> 03:31.756
Godspeed.

03:35.495 --> 03:37.662
Alex, I'd like to talk to you for a second.

03:37.764 --> 03:38.601
Sure.

03:38.734 --> 03:40.331
Okay, well, I'll go track down Shahir.

03:40.433 --> 03:41.532
He's probably not far,

03:41.634 --> 03:43.826
considering how important today is for him.

03:44.636 --> 03:45.502
Everything okay?

03:45.604 --> 03:47.204
We should postpone your pitch.

03:47.306 --> 03:49.439
The jury will understand,
considering the circumstances.

03:49.541 --> 03:51.008
No, Dawn, I'm ready for this.

03:51.110 --> 03:53.177
And if you're not,
you will jeopardize your shot

03:53.279 --> 03:54.586
at fellow of the year and all the money

03:54.636 --> 03:56.980
and the prestige that goes along with that.

03:57.082 --> 03:58.715
Well, thank you for looking out for me,

03:58.818 --> 04:00.583

Okay.

Good morning.

04:13.298 --> 04:14.464
It <i> is</i> a good morning.

04:14.566 --> 04:16.232
I had a fun time the other night.

04:16.334 --> 04:17.934
So did I.

04:18.603 --> 04:20.168
We should do it again.

04:20.271 --> 04:21.403
Tonight probably.

04:21.505 --> 04:22.972
You going up?

04:23.074 --> 04:24.807
I am, but you work on this floor,

04:24.909 --> 04:26.042
and you just got off.

04:26.144 --> 04:28.377
Doesn't mean I can't go
for a little adventure

04:28.479 --> 04:29.378

04:31.782 --> 04:32.949
I wasn't planning on it.

04:33.051 --> 04:35.703
You're an emergency doctor.
It could be an emergency.

04:40.290 --> 04:42.290
Yep. Mm.

04:44.362 --> 04:46.094
Morning, Dr. Bell.

04:46.196 --> 04:48.497
Dr. Miller.

04:48.599 --> 04:50.298
Have a nice ride in, Dr. Sharpe?

04:50.400 --> 04:53.134
I was a little cold,
but there's a saying in cycling...

"I can't feel my testicles"?

Oh, this is my floor. See you in the O.R.

04:59.042 --> 05:00.208
You should be nicer to him.

05:00.310 --> 05:01.509
He's saving the environment.

05:01.611 --> 05:03.345
Get over here.

05:03.446 --> 05:04.645
Oh.

05:06.549 --> 05:08.048
What?

05:08.150 --> 05:10.251
Hmm.

05:16.058 --> 05:17.625
How's our patient?

05:17.727 --> 05:19.794
She's not showing any signs
of coming out of this coma.

05:19.896 --> 05:21.696
Well, Charlie was like
that for three months.

05:21.798 --> 05:22.563
It can take a while.

05:22.665 --> 05:23.364
There's also this.

05:23.465 --> 05:24.598
That's why I paged you.

05:24.700 --> 05:25.766
Her temperature's up.

05:25.868 --> 05:27.134
Yeah, it has been since yesterday.

05:27.236 --> 05:28.435
It could be a sign of infection.

05:28.537 --> 05:30.000
Check her central line again.

and sputum cultures, please.

We did everything we could. It just...

06:36.633 --> 06:38.625
it just happened so fast.

06:40.267 --> 06:41.533
She threw a clot,

06:41.635 --> 06:44.536
and we couldn't restore blood flow in time.

06:45.571 --> 06:46.937
Charlie: She's brain-dead?

06:47.040 --> 06:49.907
Well, I have to run an E.E.G.,
an apnea test,

06:50.009 --> 06:52.309
and a full neuro exam, but yes.

06:52.411 --> 06:54.411
Charlie, what are you doing here?

06:54.513 --> 06:56.280
I paged him.

06:56.382 --> 06:57.447
They were friends.

Oh.

06:58.751 --> 07:00.885
I'm sorry for your loss.

07:00.987 --> 07:02.886
But you should be in
pre-op on a steroid drip.

Yeah, I'm headed straight there.

Let's clear the room.

07:10.128 --> 07:11.961
Give Charlie a chance to say goodbye.

07:19.437 --> 07:23.773
I've only ever helped
palliative patients cross over.

07:23.875 --> 07:26.309
It's pretty straightforward.

07:26.411 --> 07:28.244
How does it work when you do it?

07:28.346 --> 07:30.013
Oh, I'm pretty sure it's the same.

07:30.115 --> 07:32.716
I... ask them what they want.

07:32.818 --> 07:35.284
They tell me. I try and do it.

07:35.386 --> 07:39.855
All I want is to be reunited with Maddie.

07:39.957 --> 07:42.692
[voice breaking] That's all I've ever wanted
since the accident.

07:42.793 --> 07:45.400
Well, maybe there's something
you need to resolve before you...

07:45.594 --> 07:47.161
you go.

07:47.265 --> 07:49.998
Help me figure out what it is.

07:50.101 --> 07:52.735
Kris, I have surgery in an hour.

07:52.837 --> 07:56.004
You can't leave me here like this.

07:58.075 --> 07:59.608
Please, Charlie.

08:01.478 --> 08:03.411
You're all I have.

08:05.116 --> 08:07.549
[sighs]

08:07.651 --> 08:10.685
All work and no play
makes Maggie a dull girl.

08:10.787 --> 08:12.654
All play and no work make you a cliché.

08:12.756 --> 08:13.988
Oh, ouch.

08:14.090 --> 08:15.790
I'll have you know I'm no longer doing that.

08:15.892 --> 08:17.759
By "that," you mean the
entire nursing staff?

08:17.861 --> 08:19.327
[cellphone vibrates] Meow.

08:19.429 --> 08:21.996
I'm sorry. It's this pitch.
It has me on edge.

08:22.098 --> 08:23.498
I snapped at the residents earlier.

08:23.600 --> 08:24.866
Well, they probably deserved it.

08:24.968 --> 08:26.600
Don't worry. You're gonna be great.

08:26.702 --> 08:27.969
I know you're going to be.

08:28.071 --> 08:29.370
Hot date?

08:29.472 --> 08:31.338
No, it's my ex who wants to talk.

08:31.440 --> 08:32.740
I'll call her after work.

08:32.842 --> 08:35.143
Want to get a drink after? Help me unwind?

08:35.245 --> 08:37.078
It's karaoke night at Clinton's.

08:37.179 --> 08:38.511
That sounds great, actually,

08:38.614 --> 08:40.114
but, uh, I've got plans tonight.

08:40.216 --> 08:41.181
Oh, yeah? With whom?

08:41.284 --> 08:44.351
You don't know her..m.

08:44.453 --> 08:45.686
Did you just say "herm"?

08:45.788 --> 08:47.254
Yep. Buddy Herman.

08:47.356 --> 08:49.757
I call him... "Herm" for short.

08:49.858 --> 08:51.091
Okay, do you want to bring him?

08:51.193 --> 08:52.526
It's been a while since we've done

08:52.628 --> 08:54.060
our "total eclipse of the heart" duet.

08:54.163 --> 08:55.562
Let's give the people what they want.

08:55.665 --> 08:56.997
[hums]

Hi, River. I'm Dr. Lin. This is Dr. Miller.

09:05.440 --> 09:06.773
Can I have a look at your belly, please?

09:06.875 --> 09:07.874
Yes.

09:07.976 --> 09:09.109
How long has it been this swollen?

09:09.211 --> 09:10.277
A couple of weeks.

09:10.378 --> 09:12.145
Jacob: I'm just gonna
take a little look here.

09:12.247 --> 09:14.046
Okay.

09:14.148 --> 09:16.015
Eyes are jaundiced.

09:16.117 --> 09:18.017
Okay, let's check for fluid thrill.

09:18.119 --> 09:19.285
Billy: What is that?

09:19.387 --> 09:21.187
It's just a cool name
for fluid in the belly.

09:21.289 --> 09:22.254
Okay, that's a positive.

09:22.357 --> 09:23.323
I'm gonna run a F.A.S.T.

09:23.425 --> 09:24.957
See if it's blood or ascitic fluid.

09:25.059 --> 09:26.892
There's something wrong with her neck.

09:26.994 --> 09:28.260
[breathing heavily]

09:28.363 --> 09:30.062
Spider angiomas.

09:30.164 --> 09:31.630
I think I'm gonna be sick.

09:31.732 --> 09:32.597
Okay.

09:32.700 --> 09:34.033
Okay, it's clear. It's not blood.

09:35.336 --> 09:37.102
What's that? You said there
wasn't any blood in her belly.

09:37.205 --> 09:39.738
Uh, there isn't. It means it's
coming from her esophagus.

09:39.841 --> 09:41.040
Someone get Dr. Bishop.

09:41.142 --> 09:42.942
It's okay.

09:56.990 --> 09:58.990
Dr. Harris' technique is immaculate.

09:59.092 --> 10:01.827
Asha, no one's expecting
you to be as good as he is.

10:01.928 --> 10:03.127
I am.

10:03.230 --> 10:04.262
Dr. Mirani.

10:04.364 --> 10:05.429
Yes, Dr. Hamza?

10:05.531 --> 10:06.831
Why is my surgery...

10:06.933 --> 10:09.000
Dr. Harris' surgery bumped to this evening?

10:09.102 --> 10:09.800
I don't know.

10:09.903 --> 10:10.703
Oh, so you have no idea

10:10.753 --> 10:12.337
why your hip replacement
has taken his place?

10:12.438 --> 10:13.671
N-no.

10:13.773 --> 10:15.473
Do you know anything?

10:15.575 --> 10:16.975
Depends who you ask.

10:18.044 --> 10:19.377
Shahir.

10:19.479 --> 10:22.145
I'm looking for you.
But I can see you already heard.

10:22.248 --> 10:24.014
- You bumped our surgery?
- Yeah.

10:24.116 --> 10:26.684
Dr. Mirani worked overnight.
She's almost at her 30-hour max.

10:26.786 --> 10:29.219
We need to get her into the
O.R. while she's still fresh.

10:29.321 --> 10:32.089
What about me?

10:32.191 --> 10:33.924
You're always fresh.

10:34.026 --> 10:35.359
Yes, that's true.

10:35.461 --> 10:38.661
Shahir, look, my brain can wait.

10:38.764 --> 10:40.530
It's her first lead surgery.

10:40.632 --> 10:44.268
Come on. You remember your first time.

10:44.370 --> 10:45.969
Yeah, I do.

10:46.071 --> 10:47.704
- Okay.
- The blood you vomited...

10:47.806 --> 10:50.007
it's coming from ruptured
veins in your esophagus

10:50.109 --> 10:51.308
caused by your liver disease.

10:51.410 --> 10:52.376
Can you fix them?

10:52.477 --> 10:54.778
It's a relatively simple procedure.

10:54.880 --> 10:56.279
We're gonna go through your throat

10:56.381 --> 10:58.848
and inject a solution
into the abnormal veins,

10:58.950 --> 11:00.784
which will clot and shrink them.

11:00.886 --> 11:03.820
Now, we rarely see liver
failure in patients so young.

11:03.922 --> 11:06.355
Yeah, I, uh, caught hep "B" at a nail salon.

11:06.458 --> 11:08.858
They weren't cleaning their tools properly.

11:08.960 --> 11:10.293
I guess that's what you get

11:10.395 --> 11:12.194
when you pay 15 bucks for a mani-pedi.

11:12.297 --> 11:13.562
Her doctors caught it late.

11:13.664 --> 11:15.531
Her liver was already in rough shape.

11:15.633 --> 11:17.066
Are you on a transplant list?

11:17.168 --> 11:18.834
- At the top, actually.
- Good.

11:18.937 --> 11:20.836
Just waiting for this thing to go off.

11:20.939 --> 11:23.039
[chuckles] Could be any time now.

11:23.141 --> 11:25.274
And we want you in top
shape when that happens.

11:25.376 --> 11:28.143
That sounds... really good.

11:28.245 --> 11:29.545
Babe, what's wrong?

11:29.647 --> 11:32.881
Uh, just [exhales] I'm
having a bit of trouble

11:32.983 --> 11:34.750
[inhales] catching my breath.

11:34.852 --> 11:37.052
Okay, the diuretics aren't
working fast enough.

11:37.154 --> 11:38.253
I think the fluid in your belly

11:38.355 --> 11:39.688
is putting pressure on your lungs.

11:39.790 --> 11:41.824
Your breathing won't get
better unless we drain it.

11:41.926 --> 11:43.158
I'll prepare a paracentesis.

11:43.260 --> 11:44.159
Okay.

11:44.261 --> 11:45.626
Okay, relax. Stay calm.

11:45.728 --> 11:48.263
We'll take care of you... of both of you.

11:48.365 --> 11:50.565
[sighs] Okay.

11:50.667 --> 11:52.934
Dev: Oh, hey, you don't want that one.

11:53.036 --> 11:54.469
It's expired, see?

11:54.571 --> 11:55.903
Mm.

11:56.006 --> 11:57.538
That's disgusting.

11:57.640 --> 11:59.133
Expire dates are just a recommendation.

11:59.183 --> 12:00.842
Yeah, well, it's kind of
hard to have steady hands

12:00.948 --> 12:02.861
when your stomach's doing back flips.

12:03.091 --> 12:05.012
Not to mention the other possible outcome.

12:05.114 --> 12:06.280
Now who's being disgusting?

12:06.382 --> 12:08.816
I'm just saying you don't
want anything to distract you

12:08.918 --> 12:09.917
from those power tools.

12:10.019 --> 12:11.519
Yeah, I still can't believe Dr. Harris

12:11.621 --> 12:12.987
is bumping his own surgery for me.

12:13.089 --> 12:15.089
I'm sorry. What did you just say?

12:16.192 --> 12:17.557
Excuse me.

12:20.829 --> 12:22.329
Jeremy: This is a local anesthetic.

12:22.431 --> 12:24.798
It'll numb the area so
you won't feel anything.

12:24.900 --> 12:26.900
Maybe you can put some of that in my hand.

12:27.003 --> 12:29.703
My husband keeps trying to squeeze it off.

12:29.805 --> 12:31.872
Sorry, babe. Just trying to be supportive.

12:31.974 --> 12:33.060
I know.

12:33.184 --> 12:35.664
Maggie: I'm gonna use the ultrasound
to guide the drainage tube

12:35.714 --> 12:38.478
so we avoid the organs, okay?

12:38.580 --> 12:40.580
How long have you two been married?

12:40.682 --> 12:41.447
- Two years.
- 26 years.

12:41.550 --> 12:42.482
[chuckles]

12:42.584 --> 12:44.317
You guys need to check your story.

12:44.419 --> 12:45.986
Well, our families moved

12:46.087 --> 12:48.721
next door to each other when we were 5.

12:48.823 --> 12:50.256
Two weeks later, I asked her to marry me

12:50.358 --> 12:52.125
with a ukulele string tied in a knot.

12:52.227 --> 12:53.359
[river chuckles]

12:53.461 --> 12:55.828
We had the ceremony on the
tracks behind our house,

12:55.930 --> 12:58.531
and the train came before
I could say "I do,"

12:58.633 --> 13:00.400
hence the discrepancy.

13:00.502 --> 13:01.901
Can you feel that?

13:02.003 --> 13:03.236
No.

13:03.338 --> 13:06.138
Yeah, we stayed friends all
through high school, college.

13:06.240 --> 13:08.440
And then we decided if
we're both single at 30,

13:08.543 --> 13:09.374
we'd get together.

13:09.476 --> 13:10.576
Yeah.

13:10.678 --> 13:12.711
I mean, it was a little bit weird at first,

13:12.813 --> 13:14.880
but it didn't take long for me to fall hard.

13:14.982 --> 13:18.017
I mean, look at him. He's the best.

13:18.118 --> 13:21.020
I'm gonna need you to look
away for a second, okay?

13:22.856 --> 13:24.156
Maggie: Hold on.

13:24.258 --> 13:26.758
Why is her heart racing like that?

13:26.860 --> 13:28.626
That's not River's heartbeat.

13:28.728 --> 13:30.762
That's your baby's.

13:30.864 --> 13:32.830
Our what?

13:32.933 --> 13:34.399
By the looks of it,

13:34.501 --> 13:37.769
this little peanut is about 25 weeks along.

13:37.871 --> 13:40.638
How... how is that possible?

13:40.740 --> 13:42.674
My doctor said that I was infertile

13:42.776 --> 13:44.175
because of my liver damage.

13:44.277 --> 13:46.611
That's often the case, but not always.

13:46.713 --> 13:49.513
Yeah, liver damage can mirror
the symptoms of pregnancy...

13:49.616 --> 13:52.316
missed periods, nausea, bloating, headaches.

13:52.418 --> 13:53.918
It's a miracle, River.

13:54.020 --> 13:57.654
That's what this is. [chuckles]

13:57.756 --> 14:00.824
We're gonna have a baby.

14:00.926 --> 14:02.326
This complicates things.

14:02.428 --> 14:05.896
Let's give them a moment before
we tell them the bad news.

14:13.622 --> 14:16.723
Male announcer:
<i>Dr. Carter, to obstetrics, please.</i>

14:16.826 --> 14:19.258
<i>Dr. Carter, please report to obstetrics.</i>

14:21.530 --> 14:23.630
Hey. I tried to call you.

14:23.732 --> 14:26.232
Why did you bump your surgery?

14:26.335 --> 14:29.068
Asha's been on for 24 hours.

14:29.170 --> 14:30.337
The truth.

14:33.908 --> 14:36.309
Kristine needs my help to cross over.

14:36.410 --> 14:38.044
Charlie, come on.

14:38.146 --> 14:39.373
Alex, the last time she asked for my help,

14:39.423 --> 14:41.985
I turned her away,
and then she wrapped her car around a tree.

14:42.035 --> 14:43.782
Well, you can't blame yourself for that.

14:43.885 --> 14:46.285
I kind of do.

14:46.387 --> 14:47.720
A little bit.

14:50.691 --> 14:53.559
One last ghost.

14:53.661 --> 14:55.627
How can I help?

14:58.466 --> 14:59.865
You told me a few months ago

14:59.967 --> 15:02.133
that you had a patient
that couldn't cross over.

15:02.236 --> 15:03.602
Is that what you called it?

15:03.704 --> 15:04.670
Cross over, pass on...

15:04.772 --> 15:06.238
I prefer "pop," but, you know,

15:06.340 --> 15:08.273
it's dealer's choice, really.

15:08.375 --> 15:09.975
Well, you tried everything,

15:10.077 --> 15:13.511
but he didn't pop until he was
removed from life support.

15:13.613 --> 15:16.248
Could that be what's keeping Kristine here?

15:16.350 --> 15:18.183
It makes sense.

15:18.285 --> 15:20.318
I don't know, but even if that was the case,

15:20.420 --> 15:22.087
there's no one to pull the plug.

15:24.157 --> 15:25.890
Let me work on that.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.729
I don't know if she's
helping because she cares

15:31.831 --> 15:34.532
or just to get rid of me, but...

15:34.634 --> 15:36.901
Either way, I'm grateful.

15:39.773 --> 15:42.172
I'm sorry for any tension
I might have caused

15:42.275 --> 15:43.473
between the two of you.

15:43.575 --> 15:45.910
Alex and I have weathered so many storms

15:46.012 --> 15:48.545
it would take a hurricane to break us apart.

15:48.647 --> 15:52.549
Now, you said that you didn't
have any immediate family.

15:52.651 --> 15:55.652
What about long-lost relatives?

15:55.754 --> 15:58.655
I have a great aunt who lives in Flint.

15:58.757 --> 16:00.524
But I'm not even sure if she's still alive.

16:00.626 --> 16:02.759
It's a start.

16:15.173 --> 16:17.240
Okay, let's, uh, take a few minutes.

16:17.342 --> 16:18.474
Excuse me.

16:20.011 --> 16:22.145
You're about seven hours early, Alex.

16:22.247 --> 16:23.712
I need to talk to you about something.

16:23.815 --> 16:24.883
What is it?

16:24.998 --> 16:26.406
How long would it take to have a consent

16:26.456 --> 16:28.851
and capacity hearing to
review Kristine Field's case?

16:29.524 --> 16:31.053
She died. I hadn't heard.

16:31.155 --> 16:32.688
Yes, uh, had a stroke this morning.

16:32.790 --> 16:35.691
Shahir pronounced brain death,
but there are no next of kin,

16:35.793 --> 16:38.393
so I need the board to rule
to withdraw life support.

16:38.496 --> 16:39.962
Is that what she wanted?

16:40.064 --> 16:42.097
Yes. She told Charlie.

16:42.199 --> 16:44.366
Uh, well, Charlie, as her friend,

16:44.469 --> 16:45.868
can apply to be a public guardian,

16:45.970 --> 16:48.170
but that could take a week
or so to file that paperwork.

16:48.272 --> 16:49.095
A week?

16:49.145 --> 16:50.840
Yeah, these things take time, Alex.

16:51.026 --> 16:53.399
Okay, well, there's got
to be something we can do.

16:53.810 --> 16:55.877
Why can't you just drain
her belly like you said?

16:55.980 --> 16:58.080
Because it could cause premature labor,

16:58.182 --> 17:00.315
and the baby is barely viable as it is.

17:00.417 --> 17:02.050
We'll up the diuretics, turn our attention

17:02.152 --> 17:03.718
to fixing the bleeding in your esophagus.

17:03.820 --> 17:05.152
We want you as healthy as possible

17:05.253 --> 17:06.721
so you can carry the baby to full term

17:06.823 --> 17:08.455
and then have your transplant.

17:08.558 --> 17:10.124
What do you mean, "and then"?

17:10.226 --> 17:13.194
River, we don't do transplants
on pregnant women.

17:13.296 --> 17:14.762
I'm sorry. Nobody does.

17:14.865 --> 17:16.130
There must be a way.

17:16.232 --> 17:17.765
I-I've done the research.

17:17.867 --> 17:20.800
It's a 50-50 chance that you
wouldn't survive the anesthetic,

17:20.903 --> 17:23.371
and even if you did,
there could be birth defects.

17:23.473 --> 17:24.605
But she's next on the list.

17:24.707 --> 17:26.374
Which is why we need to have a conversation

17:26.476 --> 17:27.941
about the realities of your condition.

17:28.044 --> 17:29.477
What realities?

17:29.578 --> 17:31.979
If the procedure causes
you to go into labor,

17:32.081 --> 17:33.481
I need you guys to really think

17:33.582 --> 17:35.883
about whether you could care
for a baby that premature.

17:35.985 --> 17:37.892
Jeremy: Especially considering
all the care River needs,

17:37.942 --> 17:39.849
and will need, even after your transplant.

17:39.938 --> 17:42.922
We want you to do whatever
you have to do to save him...

17:43.158 --> 17:44.348
Or her.

17:44.398 --> 17:45.659
I don't...

17:45.761 --> 17:47.093
We didn't ask.

17:47.195 --> 17:48.529
We don't know.

17:48.631 --> 17:49.626
It's a girl.

17:53.902 --> 17:55.335
It's a girl.

17:56.454 --> 17:59.039
Our little miracle baby girl.

18:03.245 --> 18:05.011
[breathes shakily]

18:07.149 --> 18:08.648
Okay.

18:10.018 --> 18:11.984
I'm ready.

18:12.086 --> 18:14.820
All right. Let's get you up to endoscopy.

18:14.923 --> 18:17.256
- Ready?
- Yeah.

18:30.904 --> 18:33.338
Why do I feel like whatever comes their way,

18:33.441 --> 18:34.573
they'll be fine?

18:34.675 --> 18:37.309
The benefits of marrying
your best friend, I guess.

18:41.515 --> 18:44.616
Maggs, I need you to sign off
on your patient in bed one.

18:44.718 --> 18:46.818
Okay.

18:46.920 --> 18:48.687
Yeah.

18:48.789 --> 18:50.488
Yes, I understand that, but if I could...

18:50.591 --> 18:52.691
if I could just speak with her.

18:54.828 --> 18:56.928
I realize that. Okay.

18:57.030 --> 18:58.329
Thank you...

18:58.431 --> 18:59.897
for nothing.

18:59.999 --> 19:00.998
[replaces receiver]

19:01.101 --> 19:02.366
Hey.

19:02.469 --> 19:04.835
I managed to track down
Kristine's great aunt Gertie.

19:04.937 --> 19:06.804
The only problem is she has Alzheimer's.

19:06.906 --> 19:09.707
She doesn't even have legal
capacity over herself.

19:09.809 --> 19:13.444
I need you to come with me right now.

19:17.016 --> 19:18.682
Dawn called in a favor with H.R.

19:18.784 --> 19:20.985
They dug up a name... someone who was listed

19:21.087 --> 19:23.087
on Kristine's benefits a few years ago.

19:23.188 --> 19:24.888
This is him. Arlo?

19:24.991 --> 19:26.690
Hi.

19:26.792 --> 19:28.058
You must be Alex?

19:28.160 --> 19:29.593
Yes, thank you for coming.

19:29.695 --> 19:31.829
Arlo Fields, this is Charlie Harris.

19:31.931 --> 19:35.298
Thank you for being a friend
to my wife in her final days.

19:35.400 --> 19:36.666
Your wife?

19:36.768 --> 19:38.301
Uh, my ex-wife.

19:38.403 --> 19:41.438
Sorry, I never really got
used to calling Kristine that.

19:41.540 --> 19:43.607
We're very sorry for your loss.

19:43.708 --> 19:46.075
Well, you know, I haven't seen her in years,

19:46.178 --> 19:50.079
but I'm not sure I'm ready
to see her on life support.

19:50.181 --> 19:52.615
Well, if it helps, she's not in any pain.

19:52.717 --> 19:55.785
Good. She's suffered enough.

19:55.887 --> 19:58.688
Oh, this is my family here.

19:58.790 --> 20:00.690
This is my wife, uh, Julia.

20:00.792 --> 20:02.091
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

20:02.193 --> 20:03.860
Hello. Hi.

20:03.962 --> 20:04.827
What's your name?

20:04.877 --> 20:05.752
Maddie.

20:06.008 --> 20:08.964
Maddie's mine and Kristine's little girl.

20:20.354 --> 20:21.987
[siren wails]

20:23.836 --> 20:27.258
Maddie, let's go for a walk
so your dad can talk to the doctors.

20:27.360 --> 20:28.459
Yeah.

20:28.561 --> 20:31.562
Why don't you and Julia go to the café

20:31.664 --> 20:33.197
and get yourself a little breakfast?

20:33.299 --> 20:34.866
No cake pops, promise?

20:34.968 --> 20:36.200
I promise.

20:36.302 --> 20:37.634
Can I have my magazine?

20:37.737 --> 20:38.702
What do you say?

20:38.804 --> 20:40.637
Please and thank you.

20:40.740 --> 20:41.739
Good girl.

20:41.841 --> 20:43.440
[chuckles]

20:46.579 --> 20:49.847
She's, uh... she's really into science.

20:49.948 --> 20:51.948
She must have gotten that from her mother.

20:54.420 --> 20:55.652
Something wrong?

20:55.755 --> 20:58.588
We didn't realize that Maddie was...

20:58.690 --> 21:01.124
Well, I don't really know how to say this.

21:01.226 --> 21:02.859
Charlie: Kristine told me that, um,

21:02.961 --> 21:06.196
Maddie had been in a car
accident with a drunk driver.

21:06.298 --> 21:07.764
She was.

21:07.866 --> 21:09.900
She told me Maddie died.

21:10.002 --> 21:13.403
She what?

21:14.739 --> 21:18.974
Yes, Kristine was in an
accident with Maddie,

21:19.076 --> 21:21.711
but she was the one that
was driving... drunk.

21:21.813 --> 21:26.482
And, uh, it wasn't the first time.

21:26.584 --> 21:28.384
That's why I left her.

21:28.486 --> 21:30.252
And you took Maddie with you.

21:30.354 --> 21:32.288
Well, I had to protect her.

21:32.390 --> 21:33.822
You didn't have any kind of relationship

21:33.925 --> 21:34.856
with her after that?

21:34.959 --> 21:36.625
Kristine never saw Maddie?

21:36.727 --> 21:38.593
Well, I tried to reach
out for a couple years.

21:38.695 --> 21:40.829
I invited her to every birthday party,

21:40.932 --> 21:42.932
dance recitals, but she never came.

21:43.034 --> 21:44.733
She... she never even called.

21:44.835 --> 21:49.504
I'd completely lost track of
her until you called me today.

21:49.606 --> 21:50.872
Will you excuse me?

21:50.974 --> 21:52.474
Sure.

21:54.010 --> 21:59.548
You know, uh, Maddie hasn't
seen her mother since she was 4.

21:59.650 --> 22:02.250
And... and we told her in
the car on the way over

22:02.352 --> 22:03.351
why we were coming here.

22:03.453 --> 22:08.622
But I... I don't think she understood.

22:12.534 --> 22:15.129
All right, let's get that
octreotide infusion flowing.

22:15.231 --> 22:16.464
We need her portal pressure down.

22:16.566 --> 22:17.565
Will do.

22:17.667 --> 22:18.866
Jeremy: You need something, Dr. Williams?

22:18.969 --> 22:19.834
Cassie: Dr. Lin paged me.

22:19.936 --> 22:22.402
I'm on baby duty.

22:22.505 --> 22:24.672
I thought Dr. Bishop could use a buddy.

22:24.774 --> 22:28.241
Dr. Sekara's performing an
esophagogastroduodenoscopy

22:28.344 --> 22:29.643
before, if you'd prefer...

22:29.745 --> 22:31.178
No, if you can say the word, you can stay.

22:31.280 --> 22:32.580
Cassie: Okay, then.

22:32.682 --> 22:33.681
River, this is Dr. Williams.

22:33.783 --> 22:35.015
She's gonna be assisting us.

22:35.117 --> 22:36.649
Maggie: Okay, let's work fast.

22:36.751 --> 22:38.685
I don't want us to be here
any longer than we need to.

22:38.787 --> 22:40.287
Do you want to help me with the monitors?

22:40.389 --> 22:41.654
Cassie: Yeah, what are these for?

22:41.756 --> 22:43.457
This is a fetal heart-rate monitor,

22:43.558 --> 22:45.625
and that's a to-co to
watch her contractions.

22:45.727 --> 22:46.759
She's in labor?

22:46.862 --> 22:47.760
Nope, she's not.

22:47.863 --> 22:48.923
And I want to keep it that way.

22:49.012 --> 22:50.663
Jeremy: Nurse, will you
page the lab for me, please?

22:50.765 --> 22:52.811
Make sure they have plenty
of O-positive on standby.

22:52.935 --> 22:53.983
If any of these mucosa tear,

22:54.033 --> 22:55.434
and we'll have a ton of bleeding.

22:55.537 --> 22:57.570
Okay, settle in, little peanut.

22:58.089 --> 23:00.339
Dr. Williams, would you like
to administer the lidocaine?

23:00.441 --> 23:01.474
Sure.

23:07.616 --> 23:09.448
Your esophagus is frozen.

23:09.550 --> 23:11.550
All right. Here we go.

23:11.652 --> 23:13.419
Endoscope, please.

23:23.097 --> 23:24.796
You played me.

23:26.466 --> 23:28.700
You made me jeopardize my health. For what?

23:28.802 --> 23:31.403
I-I don't know what you're talking about.

23:31.505 --> 23:33.805
You used the fact that I was
a father to manipulate me,

23:33.908 --> 23:36.008
sell me some sob story
about your dead little girl

23:36.109 --> 23:37.976
and the bastard who drove you off the road.

23:38.078 --> 23:39.044
Charlie, stop it!

23:39.146 --> 23:41.179
Maddie's alive!

23:43.917 --> 23:47.352
Game's over. I'm done.

23:48.388 --> 23:50.055
Why would you say those things?

23:52.092 --> 23:53.391
Why, Charlie?

23:55.228 --> 23:58.096
Charlie, what is it?

24:03.903 --> 24:06.771
I think I know why Kristine is still here.

24:09.185 --> 24:11.508
Jeremy: All right, there they are.

24:11.611 --> 24:14.378
In the sub-mucosa of the distal esophagus.

24:14.480 --> 24:16.313
Cassie: Wow, the veins are... is...

24:16.415 --> 24:18.348
is there a less gross word than "engorged"?

24:18.451 --> 24:20.684
There's less gross. Not as accurate.

24:20.786 --> 24:22.886
How's that sodium tetradecyl sulfate coming?

24:22.988 --> 24:26.156
Loading up. 0.75 milliliters.

24:26.258 --> 24:27.624
3% concentration.

24:27.726 --> 24:28.925
Good.

24:30.729 --> 24:32.195
All right.

24:32.297 --> 24:33.964
Why don't we start with that bad boy there.

24:34.066 --> 24:37.601
Just injecting the solution
into the base of the varix.

24:37.703 --> 24:39.035
How's our baby, Dr. Lin?

24:39.137 --> 24:41.237
So far, so good.

24:42.407 --> 24:43.907
Hmm.

24:44.009 --> 24:45.942
There's nothing like that sound.

24:46.044 --> 24:47.577
[ <i>heart beating</i> ]

24:47.679 --> 24:49.145
Do you want to have kids?

24:49.247 --> 24:51.880
In general. Not with me.

24:51.983 --> 24:53.716
Not... just not right this second.

24:53.818 --> 24:56.652
Better not be. I have my hands full.

24:56.754 --> 24:58.488
Wow, it coagulates so quickly.

24:58.590 --> 25:01.157
Yeah, it's like esophageal whack-a-mole.

25:01.259 --> 25:02.825
Flush, please.

25:05.562 --> 25:06.962
Dr. Bishop, can I do the next one?

25:07.064 --> 25:10.799
Feeling brave. I like it.

25:10.901 --> 25:11.867
[alarm ringing]

25:11.969 --> 25:12.801
Sharpe?

25:12.903 --> 25:14.236
It's not mama. She's stable.

25:14.338 --> 25:15.938
Everyone stop what you're doing.

25:16.040 --> 25:17.906
River's having contractions.

25:18.009 --> 25:19.508
[River moaning]

25:23.525 --> 25:26.401
I need an I.V. bolus and
100 megs indomethacin now.

25:26.451 --> 25:27.918
- Okay.
- Dr. Lin, should we be doing that,

25:27.968 --> 25:29.875
considering her pulmonary
function is already compromised?

25:29.925 --> 25:30.816
We don't have a choice.

25:30.900 --> 25:33.274
These contractions need to stop.
The baby is barely viable.

25:33.376 --> 25:35.977
Okay, River, River,
it's gonna be all right, okay?

25:36.079 --> 25:37.445
- Sharpe?
- I'm in.

25:37.547 --> 25:39.147
Dr. Lin, we need to get back in there.

25:39.249 --> 25:40.006
She's still bleeding.

25:40.062 --> 25:42.000
Give me a minute. Please.

25:42.152 --> 25:43.885
It's not working.

25:43.987 --> 25:46.487
Another 0.25 milligrams
indomethacin right now.

25:46.589 --> 25:48.022
Okay.

25:48.124 --> 25:50.324
Okay, come on, little girl.

25:50.426 --> 25:51.959
- [moans]
- Relax.

25:52.061 --> 25:52.993
- Got it?
- Yeah.

25:53.095 --> 25:54.729
[alarm beeping] No, damn it.

25:54.831 --> 25:56.196
Okay, you're gonna have to help me turn her.

25:56.298 --> 25:57.465
Aah!

25:57.515 --> 25:59.767
River, River, breathe deeply for me, okay?

25:59.869 --> 26:00.868
- C-clamp stirrups.
- On it.

26:00.970 --> 26:02.525
We're gonna deliver this baby now.

26:03.138 --> 26:04.772
That kind of break in reality...

26:04.874 --> 26:08.075
Kristine has some deep-seated psych issues.

26:08.177 --> 26:10.277
Yeah, I practically tore her head off,

26:10.379 --> 26:12.145
and now I need her to trust me.

26:12.248 --> 26:13.546
[elevator chimes]

26:13.648 --> 26:15.682
Well, just get her upstairs,
and I'll do the rest.

26:15.784 --> 26:17.251
Okay.

26:29.664 --> 26:32.265
Kris, we need to talk.

26:32.367 --> 26:35.502
I know how to help you.

26:38.339 --> 26:41.473
You can't say those things about me...

26:41.575 --> 26:46.913
about my daughter...
and then just take them back.

26:47.015 --> 26:48.981
I don't know what I was thinking, okay?

26:49.083 --> 26:50.849
Maybe it's... maybe it's the tumor.

26:50.952 --> 26:52.118
Maybe...

26:52.220 --> 26:53.652
[sighs]

26:53.754 --> 26:56.955
Maybe I really am starting to lose it.

26:57.057 --> 27:02.895
But after my surgery,
I might not be able to see you.

27:04.298 --> 27:06.197
And if that happens...

27:08.636 --> 27:10.368
I'll be stuck here.

27:10.471 --> 27:11.769
Yeah.

27:11.871 --> 27:13.671
Maybe forever.

27:17.177 --> 27:21.246
I think I know how to
get you back to Maddie.

27:21.348 --> 27:23.848
But you have to trust me.

27:30.723 --> 27:33.624
I have the informed consent form here,

27:33.726 --> 27:35.626
but there's no rush.

27:35.728 --> 27:38.663
Are you sure this is what she wanted?

27:38.765 --> 27:40.765
She talked to Charlie about this,

27:40.867 --> 27:43.935
and she didn't want to be
kept alive after brain death.

27:44.036 --> 27:47.237
I-I still don't know what I'm gonna say

27:47.340 --> 27:48.939
to Maddie about all this.

27:49.041 --> 27:50.307
Tell her the truth.

27:50.409 --> 27:52.276
Tell her that Kristine loved her

27:52.378 --> 27:54.878
and that she never stopped
thinking about her.

27:54.981 --> 27:57.114
But she was too sick to be her mom.

27:57.216 --> 27:59.716
And... and that's not her fault.

27:59.818 --> 28:02.752
You... you seem to know a lot about this.

28:02.855 --> 28:06.523
My father committed
suicide when I was a kid.

28:06.625 --> 28:10.527
It turns out he was sick... terminal.

28:10.629 --> 28:12.395
I really wish I'd known that at the time.

28:12.498 --> 28:15.331
It would have made a world
of difference to me.

28:17.768 --> 28:20.769
Kristine grew up in the foster-care system.

28:20.872 --> 28:25.608
She got bounced around a lot,
which was probably a good thing,

28:25.710 --> 28:28.177
considering some of the
families they put her with.

28:30.215 --> 28:33.782
She started drinking when she was 13.

28:33.885 --> 28:37.019
She never mentioned that to Charlie.

28:37.121 --> 28:38.888
Well, why would she...

28:38.990 --> 28:42.257
When she fought so hard for her sobriety?

28:42.359 --> 28:45.093
[voice breaking]
And when she was sober, she...

28:45.195 --> 28:50.065
She was the most amazing woman.

28:50.167 --> 28:53.701
She was incredible with Maddie.

28:53.803 --> 28:57.205
Maddie was the light of her life.

28:57.307 --> 28:59.574
I can't imagine what Kristine felt

28:59.676 --> 29:00.909
struggling with her sobriety

29:01.011 --> 29:03.211
on top of all the other baggage
mothers carry with them.

29:03.313 --> 29:05.914
There were terrible times.

29:06.016 --> 29:08.883
But whenever Maddie talks about her, she...

29:08.985 --> 29:11.819
she only talks about the good stuff.

29:30.106 --> 29:33.107
I hope she finally finds peace.

29:33.209 --> 29:34.442
Me too.

29:34.544 --> 29:36.843
Maddie: Daddy.

29:36.946 --> 29:39.046
Arlo: Sweetie.

29:39.148 --> 29:40.213
Sweetie!

29:40.315 --> 29:42.482
Come here. Come here and sit with me.

29:44.820 --> 29:45.886
[sobs]

29:47.723 --> 29:50.057
I need to talk to you about mommy.

29:55.197 --> 29:58.731

01:04:34.427 --> 01:04:35.559
I can't... I can't feel him!

01:04:35.661 --> 01:04:37.294
You don't understand. He's not here anymore.

01:04:37.396 --> 01:04:38.462
He's stable.

01:04:38.564 --> 01:04:39.530
You must have missed something.

01:04:39.632 --> 01:04:40.832
We're monitoring him. You have to stop.

01:04:40.934 --> 01:04:42.132
No.

01:04:42.235 --> 01:04:43.400
Shahir, don't close, all right?

01:04:43.502 --> 01:04:45.302
There's something you missed.
You have to go back.

01:04:45.404 --> 01:04:46.737
Alex!

01:04:46.839 --> 01:04:47.904
This is my O.R.

01:04:48.006 --> 01:04:50.608
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

01:04:54.079 --> 01:04:55.846
[instruments clatter]

01:04:58.650 --> 01:05:00.817
Deshawn, we were able to fix your heart

01:05:00.919 --> 01:05:03.319
by pushing a small tube up through your leg.

01:05:03.421 --> 01:05:04.888
[scoffs] It's sore.

01:05:04.990 --> 01:05:06.656
It will be for a little while.

01:05:06.759 --> 01:05:08.524
But the good news is, is that...

01:05:08.627 --> 01:05:10.460
here, and I will show it to you...

01:05:10.562 --> 01:05:14.297
we were able to plug the hole
using these small little discs.

01:05:14.399 --> 01:05:15.831
Pssh, no way.

01:05:15.933 --> 01:05:17.867
Oh, sweet. Thanks.

01:05:17.969 --> 01:05:19.869
Now the blood will flow
where it's supposed to.

01:05:19.971 --> 01:05:22.639
Anyway, like I said, you should
have a little bit of discomfort,

01:05:22.741 --> 01:05:25.007
but nothing to worry about.
Your heart is in great shape.

01:05:25.109 --> 01:05:26.776
Have you heard from my mom?

01:05:26.878 --> 01:05:28.311
Uh, her plane just landed,

01:05:28.413 --> 01:05:30.413
and she should be here any minute.

01:05:30.515 --> 01:05:32.347
I'll go put on my body armor.

01:05:32.449 --> 01:05:34.083
I'm sure it's not gonna be that bad.

01:05:34.185 --> 01:05:35.785
[chuckles] Yes, it will.

01:05:35.887 --> 01:05:39.588
My dad played trumpet. Jazz. He, uh...

01:05:39.690 --> 01:05:42.557
He O.D.'d in some crappy
club in the north end.

01:05:42.660 --> 01:05:45.094
I'm sorry, Deshawn.

01:05:45.196 --> 01:05:48.196
She blames the music.

01:05:48.299 --> 01:05:52.066
So, me singing...

01:05:52.169 --> 01:05:53.802

01:05:53.904 --> 01:05:56.371

01:05:59.176 --> 01:06:03.378
I don't think it's true. I'm not him.

01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:04.578
Have you told her that?

01:06:04.681 --> 01:06:06.281
[scoffs] No.

01:06:06.382 --> 01:06:07.949
No, I can't.

Every time I try to tell her,

01:06:09.686 --> 01:06:11.452
the words get caught in my throat.

01:06:11.554 --> 01:06:12.954
Except for when you sing.

01:06:13.056 --> 01:06:15.790
[chuckles] Well, yeah.

01:06:15.892 --> 01:06:20.128
Music lets you say things
you can't normally say.

01:06:20.230 --> 01:06:24.164

she never comes to see me play.

hanging in the balance,

01:23:26.851 --> 01:23:29.318
it defines us as doctors.

01:23:29.420 --> 01:23:31.653
But every now and then,

01:23:31.755 --> 01:23:34.889
something comes along that changes the game.

01:23:34.992 --> 01:23:38.427
And with this new innovation,
we won't have to wait any more.

01:23:38.529 --> 01:23:43.165
We can bring the fight. We can be proactive.

01:23:43.267 --> 01:23:46.334
I've watched these women develop.

01:23:46.436 --> 01:23:48.402
I've seen them make mistakes.

01:23:48.505 --> 01:23:51.205
I've seen them break the rules.

01:23:51.307 --> 01:23:54.042
And, yes, it's true, we've had our, um...

01:23:54.144 --> 01:23:56.144
we've had our share of disagreements.

01:23:56.246 --> 01:24:02.483
But they pale in comparison to our triumphs.

01:24:02.585 --> 01:24:07.555
These women, they give us hope.

01:24:07.657 --> 01:24:09.557
They've shown us that with hard work

01:24:09.659 --> 01:24:13.694
and sheer damn determination
that the world will open up.

01:24:13.796 --> 01:24:16.164
And not just to those who
strive for greatness,

01:24:16.266 --> 01:24:18.899
but for those who demand it.

01:24:19.001 --> 01:24:21.669
For those who hold themselves
up to a standard that,

01:24:21.771 --> 01:24:25.172
well, if you ask me,
is pretty much impossible to meet.

01:24:25.274 --> 01:24:26.874
But, um...

01:24:26.976 --> 01:24:29.043
Here they are.

01:24:29.145 --> 01:24:32.279
Two surgeons united in a new fight

01:24:32.381 --> 01:24:34.581
with a plan that will change lives

01:24:34.684 --> 01:24:37.384
and the wherewithal to see it through.

01:24:37.486 --> 01:24:41.688
So I stand up here, honored and amazed,

01:24:41.790 --> 01:24:44.591
to call up two of my closest friends,

01:24:44.693 --> 01:24:48.195
doctors Maggie Lin and Alex Reid.

01:24:48.297 --> 01:24:50.330
[applause]

01:24:52.967 --> 01:24:54.533
Oh, I'm so proud of you!

01:24:59.207 --> 01:25:00.606
Charlie?

01:25:02.543 --> 01:25:03.976
You need to go.

01:25:04.079 --> 01:25:05.745
Hey. You broke your promise.

01:25:05.847 --> 01:25:06.713
[women scream]

01:25:06.815 --> 01:25:08.480
It's time to pay up.

01:25:08.583 --> 01:25:10.816
[gunshot]
