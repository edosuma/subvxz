WEBVTT

00:02.836 --> 00:07.376
Wings of Titania,
bear mine eyes aloft as I bid thee...

00:07.574 --> 00:09.134
- Hex bag.
- So we're thinking witch.

00:09.243 --> 00:11.519
Yeah. This is Old World black magic.

00:11.712 --> 00:14.318
- We're here for the witch Rowena.
Mother.

00:14.515 --> 00:17.655
But you have managed to stay away
for 300 years.

00:17.851 --> 00:20.161
There was unpleasantness
with the Grand Coven.

00:20.354 --> 00:22.061
- It was no environment for a child.
- Aah!

00:22.256 --> 00:24.576
- What did they take?
- Peanut butter and bread.

00:24.758 --> 00:27.318
- They sent me to a boys' home.
- Teach you some discipline.

00:27.427 --> 00:29.338
Responsibility. Keep you out of trouble.

00:29.530 --> 00:31.170
- It's Cain.
- As in Cain and Abel.

00:31.265 --> 00:34.405
Lucifer was gonna make my brother
into his pet, so I offered a deal.

00:34.601 --> 00:37.343
- it's the bloody Mark of Cain.
- So I became a soldier of hell.

00:37.538 --> 00:40.109
I can give you the Mark, Dean,
if it's what you truly want.

00:40.340 --> 00:42.580
But you have to know,
with the Mark comes a great burden.

00:42.676 --> 00:45.748
- What the hell? Charlie.
- We're still connected physically.

00:45.946 --> 00:47.391
If you hurt her, you hurt me.

00:52.452 --> 00:54.090
Dean!

00:54.288 --> 00:56.791
- I'm so sorry, kiddo.
- I forgive you, Dean.

00:57.291 --> 00:58.292
You good?

00:59.593 --> 01:01.129
No.

01:14.775 --> 01:16.618
I didn't anything from you, man.

01:16.810 --> 01:18.483
It wasn't me, man.

01:18.712 --> 01:20.632
You're gonna keep coming and stealing?

01:20.781 --> 01:23.455
- It was that skinny broad.
- Where's my money? Where's my money'?

01:23.650 --> 01:24.924
You give me my money!

01:27.654 --> 01:29.463
Swear on my mother, JP...

01:30.157 --> 01:34.105
...I see your face in here
again, I'll kill you.

01:35.329 --> 01:38.970
Like hell. This is frigging America, man.
You can't just...

01:45.405 --> 01:46.679
What you looking at?

02:51.171 --> 02:54.584
Well, after Cain killed Abel,
he became a demon.

02:55.842 --> 02:58.846
I felt connected to you
right from the beginning.

02:59.079 --> 03:01.491
You and I are very much alike.

03:02.382 --> 03:05.591
Loan give you the Mark, Dean,
if it's what you truly want.

03:06.887 --> 03:09.231
No, when I kill, I kill for a reason.

03:09.423 --> 03:10.925
I'm nothing like Cain.

03:12.492 --> 03:15.769
Why are you fighting what you really are?

03:58.305 --> 04:00.581
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:03.276 --> 04:04.983
Caught a case.

04:05.912 --> 04:08.654
Apparently, something is taking people...

04:09.316 --> 04:11.626
...and leaving their clothes.

04:11.818 --> 04:14.822
Hmm. About time this gig got an R rating.

04:17.156 --> 04:20.070
All right. Why don't you check it out?
I'll hold down the fort.

04:22.062 --> 04:24.804
Dean, you haven't left
the bunker in a week.

04:28.835 --> 04:30.940
- And?
- And...

04:31.138 --> 04:35.086
...you can't just live the rest
of your life locked up in this room.

04:35.275 --> 04:38.347
I don't know. I got three hots and a cot.
Could be worse.

04:38.578 --> 04:42.355
- Look, I know you're worried about the Mark.
- Yes, Sam, lam.

04:44.117 --> 04:46.859
- Between what I did to Charlie...
- Charlie forgave you.

04:47.954 --> 04:49.592
How about you forgive yourself?

04:51.691 --> 04:54.194
I'm not exactly batting a thousand here,
you know?

04:54.427 --> 04:56.964
Yeah, I do know that,
but staying locked up in here...

04:57.164 --> 04:59.364
...sitting on the ground,
reading the same lore books...

04:59.533 --> 05:01.843
...over and over and over again,
it's not helping you.

05:02.035 --> 05:05.209
You need to get back in the game.
For your own good.

05:05.672 --> 05:08.175
You can beat this, Dean.

05:09.109 --> 05:12.147
- You really believe that?
- Yeah, you're damn right I believe that.

05:13.980 --> 05:17.018
You know, you also believed
in the Easter Bunny till you were 12.

05:17.217 --> 05:18.719
No, I didn't.

05:21.354 --> 05:22.662
Look, I was 11.

05:23.223 --> 05:24.566
And a half.

05:25.392 --> 05:27.531
And a half, right.

05:32.566 --> 05:34.204
So?

05:38.371 --> 05:39.406
Okay.

05:44.044 --> 05:45.250
And then...

05:45.478 --> 05:49.654
...there was this bright light,
and, barn, the dude's just gone.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.557
Nothing left but, uh...

05:51.751 --> 05:54.231
A cheap suit and a pair of Florsheims?

05:56.056 --> 05:57.899
Pretty much.

05:58.525 --> 06:00.732
- You see anyone else?
- No, sir, officer.

06:00.927 --> 06:03.066
Now, what about a chill?

06:03.263 --> 06:06.403
- Or did you smell any rotten eggs?
- What?

06:06.600 --> 06:09.046
No, man. Uh...

06:09.236 --> 06:10.681
Smelled flowers, though.

06:11.605 --> 06:14.381
You smelled flowers? What kind of flowers?

06:16.576 --> 06:19.284
- Flowery flowers.
- Flowery flowers.

06:20.914 --> 06:22.416
Look.

06:23.383 --> 06:27.297
We all know what's going on here, okay?

06:28.054 --> 06:29.089
Don't say it.

06:29.723 --> 06:31.703
- Aliens.
- He said it.

06:31.892 --> 06:34.236
- Yeah, he did.
- Dude was abducted.

06:34.427 --> 06:38.705
Believe me, I know. May 2003.

06:38.899 --> 06:42.904
Those suckers, they grabbed me,
and they probed me. Everywhere.

06:43.103 --> 06:44.446
- Okay.
- Thanks for your time.

06:44.638 --> 06:47.619
- I'm talking everywhere. And I mean...
- Okay, okay.

06:47.807 --> 06:49.946
Well, the wheels just came flying
off the bus.

06:50.143 --> 06:53.283
Yeah. No cold spots.
Means it probably wasn't a ghost.

06:53.480 --> 06:56.427
And no sulfur means no demons.
So that leaves us with what?

06:56.616 --> 06:59.256
Couple of little green dudes
and a bucket of lube?

06:59.452 --> 07:02.228
Or fairies. Or angels.

07:02.422 --> 07:05.801
- I'd rather have the little green dudes.
- I'll go scope out JP's place.

07:05.992 --> 07:07.335
You ask around inside.

07:10.096 --> 07:12.770
Or you know what?
We don't have to split up.

07:13.266 --> 07:16.839
No, no. it's cool. I can handle a little
20 questions with the locals, okay?

07:17.070 --> 07:19.482
- You sure?
- Yeah. Hey, look, it's a dive bar.

07:19.673 --> 07:21.516
It's my comfort zone. Hmm?

07:23.310 --> 07:26.450
All right. Good. Great.

07:36.323 --> 07:39.668
It's only a matter of time

07:39.859 --> 07:41.964
It's only a matter of time

07:42.162 --> 07:43.197
What can I do you?

07:45.632 --> 07:48.010
Screw it. I'm gonna believe in myself.

07:48.201 --> 07:51.478
- Attaboy.
- Give me something dark and strong.

07:54.874 --> 07:57.184
Hey, did you know that guy
that went missing? JP?

07:59.379 --> 08:02.383
- Who's asking?
- Just an old pal.

08:03.149 --> 08:05.686
Look, I'm sorry to hear
about what happened...

08:05.885 --> 08:08.889
...but guy's a lowlife.

08:09.990 --> 08:13.870
That night? I had to kick his ass
out of here for stealing my tips.

08:14.794 --> 08:16.398
Whatever JP got...

08:17.197 --> 08:18.505
...probably had it coming.

08:19.232 --> 08:20.404
Ouch.

08:23.403 --> 08:26.714
You feel the separation

08:26.906 --> 08:30.376
Will put a stop to all you've seen to

08:30.577 --> 08:33.717
The same old situation

08:33.913 --> 08:39.090
Though you struggle for life
In the end it defeats you

08:45.759 --> 08:47.261
JP wasn't that bad.

08:49.329 --> 08:53.243
- You knew him?
- This isn't exactly Cheers, but, yeah.

08:54.868 --> 08:58.907
And don't get me wrong.
I would not buy a used car from the guy.

08:59.105 --> 09:00.243
But he was harmless.

09:01.574 --> 09:02.712
So, what was his problem?

09:02.909 --> 09:05.412
Heh. What wasn't?

09:05.612 --> 09:08.354
You're in here getting stunned
while the sun's still up...

09:08.548 --> 09:12.360
...your life's a regular Charlie Foxtrot,
trust me.

09:16.056 --> 09:18.468
- I'm Dean.
- Tina.

09:23.096 --> 09:24.803
Here you go.

09:25.465 --> 09:28.071
How do you know the Royals Motel
in Scranton?

09:28.268 --> 09:30.748
My dad, me and my bro
got snowed in there for a week.

09:31.938 --> 09:35.385
Well, I was there for about three months...

09:35.575 --> 09:37.612
...after my father drank
all our money away.

09:38.244 --> 09:42.124
Lived on white rice and Tic Tacs
until they kicked us out.

09:42.315 --> 09:43.453
Good times.

09:44.284 --> 09:47.788
Heh, heh. My dad was always working,
so I came up with 101 ways...

09:47.987 --> 09:49.466
...to make macaroni and cheese.

09:49.656 --> 09:52.933
- Serious?
- Oh, yeah, add ketchup for spice.

09:53.126 --> 09:55.402
Tuna, hot dogs...

09:55.595 --> 09:56.972
...fluff marshmallow mix.

09:57.163 --> 10:00.474
- Oh, that sounds disgusting.
- Well, my brother thought it was exotic.

10:02.435 --> 10:05.780
Well, here's to crappy childhoods.

10:05.972 --> 10:07.815
All right.

10:11.978 --> 10:12.979
- Oh. Whew.
- Oh.

10:14.347 --> 10:17.328
- Oh. Sorry.
- I should go.

10:18.518 --> 10:19.997
Uh...

10:23.623 --> 10:26.126
Before you fall hopelessly in love with me.

10:26.493 --> 10:29.440
- You gonna be okay?
- I always am.

10:32.832 --> 10:34.470
- How we looking?
- Not great.

10:34.667 --> 10:37.307
Turns out JP was about three days
from getting evicted.

10:37.504 --> 10:40.849
His landlord said the guy
blasted Neil Diamond 24/7...

10:41.040 --> 10:45.011
...and that his bathroom was, quote,
"like staring into the devil's butt."

10:45.845 --> 10:50.021
- That's vivid.
- Yeah, and accurate. I saw it.

10:50.216 --> 10:52.719
- You saw the john, or, uh...?
- Don't.

10:53.219 --> 10:54.357
So you got anything?

10:55.155 --> 10:59.228
Yeah, I got jack with two scoops of squat.

10:59.859 --> 11:02.703
I don't know, man.
I think we ought to call it a night and...

11:02.896 --> 11:03.966
And what?

11:05.999 --> 11:07.069
Dean? Hello?

11:08.334 --> 11:10.245
Sammy, I think I got something.

11:17.977 --> 11:19.684
Tina!

11:52.745 --> 11:54.122
What the hell?

12:15.468 --> 12:17.971
Son of a bitch.

12:25.712 --> 12:27.885
Seriously?

12:29.916 --> 12:32.396
Ugh. Seriously?

12:32.585 --> 12:34.656
Ahem. Hey.

12:37.457 --> 12:38.902
What's your name?

12:39.092 --> 12:40.400
Dean.

12:41.794 --> 12:44.070
Dean? It's me. Tina.

12:45.265 --> 12:46.903
What?

12:47.667 --> 12:49.943
Please tell me you know
what the hell is going on.

12:50.136 --> 12:51.979
Honestly, I'm not sure yet.

12:52.171 --> 12:54.845
Because I left the bar,
and then there was this...

12:55.074 --> 12:56.678
A light? A bright light.

12:56.909 --> 13:01.085
Yes, and then I was here
and I thought this was a nightmare, but...

13:01.281 --> 13:03.522
Oh, God, if you're here...

13:03.750 --> 13:06.993
- It can't be real. This doesn't...
- I know. Just try to stay calm.

13:07.186 --> 13:11.100
Stay calm? I'm a frigging tween, and you
look like some One Direction reject.

13:11.291 --> 13:14.170
And we're in some freaky
serial-killer basement.

13:14.360 --> 13:15.862
- I can't...
- Tina, Tina. Just...

13:16.362 --> 13:18.706
I'm not gonna let anything happen
to you, okay?

13:20.700 --> 13:23.476
Look, anything else happen to you?

13:23.670 --> 13:25.616
This is crazy.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.216
How are you so calm?

13:28.808 --> 13:30.685
Practice.

13:31.210 --> 13:32.382
Who's your friend?

13:34.380 --> 13:37.384
Not sure. He doesn't talk.

13:40.286 --> 13:42.061
JP?

14:07.513 --> 14:09.993
- No! Aah!
- Hey! Hey!

14:10.183 --> 14:12.390
- Aah!
- No!

14:14.520 --> 14:15.897
You can't do this!

14:18.191 --> 14:19.761
No!

14:38.111 --> 14:39.419
What is it?

14:59.799 --> 15:00.869
Hey, buddy.

15:02.301 --> 15:03.803
Where'd that jacket come from?

15:05.805 --> 15:06.806
My bar mitzvah.

15:08.241 --> 15:09.584
It was a magical night.

15:09.776 --> 15:11.619
That right?

15:12.945 --> 15:14.822
Why don't you try that again?

15:15.581 --> 15:17.151
Dumpster.

15:17.383 --> 15:19.385
Found it by a Dumpster.

15:19.585 --> 15:21.223
All right.

15:22.155 --> 15:23.600
Mm.

15:29.996 --> 15:31.600
They probably poisoned it.

15:31.798 --> 15:33.675
Mm. Mm.

15:38.471 --> 15:41.941
Right. Obviously.

15:45.344 --> 15:47.153
What do you think they're doing to JP?

15:49.081 --> 15:50.958
Nothing good.

16:14.874 --> 16:16.217
What are you doing?

16:19.812 --> 16:21.052
Getting us out of here.

16:29.188 --> 16:31.634
You know, before...

16:32.124 --> 16:34.035
...I thought you were just another drunk.

16:35.828 --> 16:37.637
I prefer "functional alcoholic."

16:38.297 --> 16:40.470
Seriously, who...?

16:40.666 --> 16:42.043
What are you?

16:46.005 --> 16:47.678
That...

16:48.307 --> 16:50.082
...is a long-ass story.

17:44.096 --> 17:45.541
Flowers.

17:54.273 --> 17:55.308
Yahtzee.

18:01.247 --> 18:03.488
- Get out.
- What?

18:06.752 --> 18:08.993
Hurry. I'll keep him busy.

18:10.423 --> 18:13.563
- Screw that. You're coming with me.
- There's no time. Go. Get help.

18:13.759 --> 18:15.170
- I know you will.
- Tina...

18:24.837 --> 18:27.909
Help me! Help me! Please!

18:28.107 --> 18:29.916
I need a doctor!

18:30.643 --> 18:32.919
I need a doctor now!

18:38.250 --> 18:39.923
What are you screaming about, girl?

19:09.649 --> 19:11.856
- Yeah?
- Hi, Sammy.

19:16.489 --> 19:17.900
Dean?

19:39.912 --> 19:42.756
- Wait a second. You're, uh...
- Uh-huh.

19:44.550 --> 19:46.689
- How?
- No clue.

19:46.886 --> 19:49.389
There was some Scarf ace-looking dude,
a bright light.

19:49.588 --> 19:52.194
Next thing I know,
I wake up looking like Bieber.

19:53.859 --> 19:57.238
- Why would someone turn you into...?
- Don't know. Don't care.

19:57.430 --> 20:00.036
- Hey, we got any grenades?
- What?

20:00.232 --> 20:02.075
Dude. Wait. Wait a second. Talk to me.

20:02.268 --> 20:04.077
Really, Sam? Now?

20:04.270 --> 20:06.910
I got no grass on the infield,
and a girl's gonna die.

20:07.106 --> 20:09.586
Sorry if I'm not in a chatty mood.

20:09.775 --> 20:12.278
Look, you wanted me back in the game...

20:12.511 --> 20:14.422
...I'm back in the damn game.

20:14.613 --> 20:16.456
Come on.

20:22.955 --> 20:26.129
Oh. Ma'am, allow me.

20:32.231 --> 20:34.643
Your son is so polite.

20:36.469 --> 20:37.539
Thanks.

20:41.774 --> 20:44.050
- Where we heading?
- Tell you on the way.

20:49.615 --> 20:52.061
Okay, okay. Hey, wait. Uh...

20:52.251 --> 20:53.628
Maybe I should drive.

20:53.819 --> 20:57.494
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Seat, seat, seat. Unh.

20:58.491 --> 20:59.902
Whew.

21:07.433 --> 21:10.312
Cake? Why would they give you cake?

21:10.503 --> 21:11.982
Don't know.

21:12.171 --> 21:16.017
- It wasn't even good cake. Too dry.
- Heh.

21:24.016 --> 21:25.586
What?

21:27.319 --> 21:28.354
Nothing.

21:31.624 --> 21:34.161
Okay. Not nothing. Look, this is bizarre.

21:34.360 --> 21:36.101
Even for us. Dean, this is insane.

21:36.295 --> 21:39.139
You're, like... You're, like, 14?

21:39.331 --> 21:40.674
How does it even feel?

21:42.201 --> 21:47.310
Well, I'm me. I'm old me, but I'm a kid...

21:47.506 --> 21:49.008
It's freaking weird, dude.

21:51.143 --> 21:52.884
And...

21:53.879 --> 21:55.358
What?

21:57.683 --> 22:02.325
There was a Taylor Swift song
on the bus that I hopped to the motel...

22:03.222 --> 22:04.724
...and I liked it, Sam.

22:05.558 --> 22:07.697
I liked it a lot.

22:08.994 --> 22:10.735
- Okay.
- And my voice is weird...

22:10.963 --> 22:14.638
...and I've got like nine zits,
and I have zero control over this.

22:14.834 --> 22:17.554
- It's up, it's down, it's up for no reason.
- That's enough. Thanks.

22:17.736 --> 22:20.046
Uh-— Ahem. That's just called puberty.

22:20.239 --> 22:22.879
Yeah. Which sucks. Again.

22:25.144 --> 22:29.024
Well, listen, I checked out the alley
where you got jumped...

22:29.215 --> 22:30.421
...and I found yarrow.

22:32.017 --> 22:34.554
- Which means what?
- We're probably dealing with a witch.

22:34.753 --> 22:37.063
Yarrow's a flower.
They use it in a ton of spells.

22:37.256 --> 22:40.362
Okay. We still got some
of that witch-killing crap in the trunk?

22:40.559 --> 22:43.233
Hell, yeah. So we'll get
you changed back...

22:43.429 --> 22:46.069
...and then light Sabrina's ass up.

22:51.670 --> 22:52.944
Right?

22:55.274 --> 22:56.446
Yeah, about that...

22:58.377 --> 23:00.755
It turns out this whole freak show
has an upside.

23:04.683 --> 23:06.458
The Mark is gone.

23:08.254 --> 23:09.699
How?

23:09.889 --> 23:13.268
Well, if this hoodoo slammed me
back into the body I had when I was 14...

23:13.459 --> 23:15.439
- You didn't have the Mark then.
- Yeah.

23:15.628 --> 23:18.768
- And if we reverse the spell...
- Then it's gonna come back.

23:18.964 --> 23:21.069
That's what I'm thinking.

23:21.734 --> 23:23.145
So...

23:25.971 --> 23:26.972
Maybe we don't.

23:29.475 --> 23:32.786
Don't... Wait a second, are you saying
you wanna stay like this?

23:32.978 --> 23:34.252
No.

23:34.813 --> 23:36.292
No, but...

23:36.482 --> 23:39.463
...if it's between being a rage monster
slash borderline demon...

23:39.652 --> 23:41.632
...or a teenager?

23:41.820 --> 23:46.098
- Really?
- Look, I'm not a fan either, but...

23:46.292 --> 23:47.828
Sam, this is problem solved.

23:49.295 --> 23:51.468
And I'm still me. I can still hunt.

23:51.664 --> 23:55.510
I'm just, you know, dewier.

23:55.734 --> 23:58.806
Okay, look. You have a point, kind of.

23:59.004 --> 24:01.484
- But, dude...
- I know.

24:05.778 --> 24:08.315
virgin liver.

24:08.514 --> 24:12.860
So, what do you say when we're done doing our
hero thing, we take her for a test drive?

24:14.853 --> 24:15.854
Yeah, sure.

24:17.523 --> 24:20.527
I mean, you can drink again in what?
Like seven years?

24:21.794 --> 24:23.637
- That's not funny.
- That's kind of funny.

24:23.829 --> 24:25.866
- It's not funny.
- Come on. It's kind of funny.

24:41.213 --> 24:42.487
Looks like someone's home.

24:42.681 --> 24:46.185
Okay. Lets go in through the basement
and get Tina out first.

24:46.385 --> 24:47.955
All right.

25:24.089 --> 25:26.160
It's still open.

25:29.595 --> 25:30.835
Tina?

25:35.501 --> 25:36.673
All right, let's go.

25:38.070 --> 25:41.779
- Dean, I'm way too big to fit in that.
- First time you ever had to say that, huh?

25:43.275 --> 25:45.881
Big talk coming from the dude
wearing Underoos.

25:48.781 --> 25:51.261
Okay, good one. Here.
Why don't you go around back?

25:51.450 --> 25:53.794
- Look for another way in.
- Yeah.

27:24.843 --> 27:26.550
Don't.

27:26.778 --> 27:28.485
Where's the girl?

27:29.047 --> 27:31.550
Upstairs. Alive.

27:31.783 --> 27:34.525
- What did you do to us?
- Nothing.

27:34.720 --> 27:36.893
I'm no witch.

27:37.222 --> 27:38.895
I just work for one.

27:39.558 --> 27:41.629
Crappy gig. Where is he?

27:43.529 --> 27:45.133
She.

27:45.397 --> 27:49.072
And she is the worst person in the world.

27:49.301 --> 27:50.507
Is that so?

27:52.304 --> 27:55.751
I've been with her for centuries.

27:56.642 --> 27:59.885
Things I've seen her do...

28:00.078 --> 28:02.388
My sister and I...

28:02.581 --> 28:05.391
...she made us hurt people.

28:05.584 --> 28:07.723
Kill people.

28:07.920 --> 28:11.060
And when we tried to escape...

28:11.256 --> 28:13.600
...she caught us.

28:13.825 --> 28:15.532
Tortured me.

28:15.727 --> 28:19.675
And then she made me eat
poor Gretel's heart.

28:21.099 --> 28:23.909
Wait, witch? Gretel? Heh.

28:24.102 --> 28:25.775
What, are you saying that you're...?

28:26.004 --> 28:27.915
Hansel.

28:28.106 --> 28:29.585
My name is Hansel.

28:29.775 --> 28:32.085
Hansel? And then... And Gretel?

28:32.277 --> 28:35.053
Hansel and Gretel?
Like the fable, like the Brothers Grimm?

28:35.247 --> 28:40.128
It wasn't a fable.
It was based on a true story.

28:40.352 --> 28:42.696
They just gave it a happy ending.

28:45.224 --> 28:49.138
Oh. Okay.
We get to barbecue a celebrity. Cool.

28:50.128 --> 28:52.369
You can't kill her.

28:52.564 --> 28:53.975
You're just men.

28:55.801 --> 28:57.644
We're more than that.

29:00.639 --> 29:01.947
We're hunters.

29:02.541 --> 29:03.781
Ah.

29:05.110 --> 29:06.453
Then let me help.

29:08.413 --> 29:10.654
Help? What's in it for you?

29:11.416 --> 29:14.761
Because if you're going to fry
that candy-coated bitch...

29:14.953 --> 29:16.626
...I want in.

29:17.589 --> 29:19.330
You wanna help?

29:21.126 --> 29:23.663
- Tell me how to turn him back.
- Sam, it can wait.

29:24.997 --> 29:26.670
Tell me how.

29:27.766 --> 29:30.178
The hex bag that I'm wearing...

29:32.104 --> 29:33.674
...it will reverse the spell.

29:33.905 --> 29:37.580
Squeeze it,
and you'll return to your proper age.

29:44.583 --> 29:49.532
Look, we waste the witch,
I give you the cure.

29:50.088 --> 29:51.624
Deal?

30:06.605 --> 30:10.212
Your friend JP
didn't have much meat on his bones.

30:10.442 --> 30:15.391
Heh. But a good cook works
with the ingredients she's given.

30:19.384 --> 30:21.386
Mm.

30:22.287 --> 30:24.699
Ah, wunderbar.

30:28.894 --> 30:30.896
Oh, don't worry, liebchen...

30:31.129 --> 30:33.200
...you're too good for soup.

30:33.398 --> 30:37.710
I'm thinking a nice sweet chili glaze...

30:37.903 --> 30:40.247
...a few hours roasting in the oven...

30:40.906 --> 30:42.408
...and an apple in your mouth.

31:06.531 --> 31:07.601
Hansel.

31:08.900 --> 31:10.538
And pals.

31:10.736 --> 31:13.046
Well, our lost lamb.

31:13.238 --> 31:16.117
I thought we'd have to go looking for you.

31:16.675 --> 31:19.781
Maybe even abandon
our home, sweet home here.

31:20.011 --> 31:23.754
I never dreamt you'd be stupid enough
to come back on your own.

31:23.949 --> 31:26.429
Hansel, take care of them.

31:28.587 --> 31:30.430
Yeah, he's not exactly your biggest fan.

31:30.622 --> 31:33.296
Maybe you shouldn't have made him
chow down on his sister.

31:36.962 --> 31:39.943
I never made Hansel do anything.

31:41.433 --> 31:43.310
- Unh!
- Damn it.

31:44.236 --> 31:45.306
They're hunters.

32:00.485 --> 32:04.831
Now, who's hungry?

32:11.129 --> 32:12.608
Don't move.

32:15.567 --> 32:19.447
Oof. Oh, scrawny.
We'll have to fatten you up.

32:19.638 --> 32:20.912
Don't frigging touch me.

32:21.106 --> 32:22.585
I'm gonna do more than that.

32:22.774 --> 32:27.985
Children, oh, they're
so sweet and innocent.

32:28.413 --> 32:30.154
And delicious.

32:30.348 --> 32:32.123
- You'll see.
Heh-heh-heh.

32:32.317 --> 32:35.787
When I cook him up, I'll give you some.

32:35.987 --> 32:38.991
If you like kids so much,
why not go after kids?

32:39.191 --> 32:41.432
- What's with this whole Fountain of Youth?
- Hmm.

32:41.626 --> 32:45.472
In the olden days,
if a child went missing, eh.

32:45.664 --> 32:47.610
The young died all the time.

32:47.799 --> 32:52.612
Now, though, with all your Amber Alerts
and your milk cartons?

32:52.804 --> 32:56.217
A person fillets one rug rat,
and people get so angry.

32:56.441 --> 32:58.443
Yeah. I blame Obama.

32:58.643 --> 33:00.452
So I improvise.

33:00.645 --> 33:03.956
I take adults no one will miss
and give them back their youth.

33:04.149 --> 33:06.288
And then Kentucky-fry them.

33:07.118 --> 33:09.462
It's the only way I can eat in peace.

33:14.693 --> 33:16.297
So, uh, is it worth it?

33:16.495 --> 33:19.738
I mean, word on the street
is people kind of taste like chicken.

33:19.965 --> 33:25.472
A bit. European children are more,
uh, free range. Gamier.

33:26.071 --> 33:29.177
Americans, though? Mm! They are heaven.

33:29.374 --> 33:32.253
- Heh, heh. Fattier.
- Heh-heh-heh.

33:32.477 --> 33:38.223
The meat so finely marbled it's almost
buttery. I just can't get enough.

33:38.416 --> 33:41.989
- Mm. Awesome.
- No, I am in awe.

33:42.187 --> 33:45.031
This is my first visit to your country,
and I have to say...

33:45.223 --> 33:47.863
...God bless the U.S.A.

33:48.059 --> 33:49.561
Oh, so you're a tourist?

33:49.761 --> 33:52.674
No. It's business, not pleasure.

33:52.864 --> 33:54.537
An old friend is causing trouble...

33:54.733 --> 33:57.407
...and the Grand Coven
asked me to take care of her.

33:57.602 --> 33:59.513
Poor, stupid Rowena.

34:03.174 --> 34:05.051
Wait, Rowena?

34:07.546 --> 34:10.025
She got red hair, thing for ritzy hotels?

34:11.081 --> 34:13.255
- How do you know that?
- Huh?

34:42.480 --> 34:45.051
Now you burn!

34:47.284 --> 34:48.786
Stay down, boy.

34:52.290 --> 34:53.735
Turn him.

35:03.068 --> 35:04.138
The hell?

35:54.386 --> 35:59.859
That was crazy. Like, psycho crazy.

36:00.058 --> 36:01.696
And you do this all the time?

36:01.893 --> 36:04.567
- All the frigging time.
- Not all the time.

36:04.796 --> 36:08.209
So can you turn me back?

36:12.203 --> 36:15.082
The hex bag went up in flames.

36:15.306 --> 36:16.717
I'm so sorry, Tina.

36:18.743 --> 36:21.383
We may be able
to reverse-engineer the spell, though.

36:30.889 --> 36:32.562
Or maybe you don't.

36:33.925 --> 36:35.700
Come again?

36:38.730 --> 36:42.200
I got three ex-husbands...

36:42.400 --> 36:46.849
...50 grand in debt and not much else.

36:47.038 --> 36:50.713
I was kind of a crappy adult.

36:54.212 --> 36:56.123
Maybe I'll do better this time around.

36:56.347 --> 36:59.624
Get out of town. Get a fresh start.

37:00.618 --> 37:02.928
This is my second chance.

37:03.121 --> 37:05.032
Everybody wants a second chance, right?

37:10.795 --> 37:12.604
Sure you're gonna be all right?

37:13.364 --> 37:16.277
Like I told you, I always am.

37:19.270 --> 37:21.250
Can we at least give you a ride somewhere?

37:25.543 --> 37:27.648
Give me the keys.

37:32.951 --> 37:35.158
All right, here you go.
It's all the cash we got.

37:35.386 --> 37:38.060
Thanks. For everything.

37:38.990 --> 37:40.628
You stay safe out there, you hear?

37:40.825 --> 37:42.668
I will.

37:45.063 --> 37:49.409
And hey, we'll always have
the Royals Motel, right?

37:58.009 --> 38:03.357
So Grand Coven. Any ideas?

38:03.581 --> 38:05.185
Doesn't sound good.

38:05.416 --> 38:08.022
It sounds like a '80s hair-metal band.

38:08.253 --> 38:12.030
You know, lot of hairspray.
Lot of eye shadow. Lot of keytar.

38:14.526 --> 38:17.996
No? Nothing? Come on, man,
I'm painting a word picture here.

38:18.530 --> 38:19.668
Is it back?

38:27.372 --> 38:30.182
Look, I know what you're gonna say,
but you were in deep...

38:30.375 --> 38:33.686
I know, I know.
You saved me and you saved Tina...

38:33.878 --> 38:37.348
...and you pulled a Dean Winchester.

38:41.019 --> 38:42.054
Thank you.

38:44.055 --> 38:45.625
Anytime.

38:46.357 --> 38:50.134
Look, man. Do I wish the Mark was gone?

38:50.328 --> 38:53.537
Yes, of course. Absolutely, I do, but...

38:55.233 --> 38:56.644
I wanted you back.

38:58.069 --> 39:01.380
And now, here you are,
and you didn't Hulk out...

39:01.739 --> 39:03.650
...so I'll take the win.

39:04.742 --> 39:09.213
As for the rest of it,
the Mark, everything else...

39:11.482 --> 39:13.223
...we'll figure it out.

39:13.418 --> 39:15.056
We always do.

39:16.087 --> 39:17.760
Damn right.
