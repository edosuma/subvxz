00:05.740 --> 00:07.405
(intriguing music)

00:49.750 --> 00:51.083
(light music)

00:54.254 --> 00:55.854
(meowing)

00:58.692 --> 00:59.958
Woof, woof!

01:02.430 --> 01:03.628
Meow!

01:06.300 --> 01:07.432
Woof, woof!

01:11.839 --> 01:13.371
(sighs)

01:13.441 --> 01:14.573
Meow.

01:15.676 --> 01:16.574
(gasps)

01:20.915 --> 01:22.714
(screams)

01:30.390 --> 01:32.190
Gentlemen, thank you so much
for coming.

01:32.259 --> 01:33.926
It's simply terrible.

01:34.061 --> 01:35.394
You are the lady of the house?

01:35.529 --> 01:38.830
Yes, deborah anderson. Uh, I
was the one who telephoned.

01:40.267 --> 01:42.467
We were having a party
for my husband when one of
the guests -

01:42.536 --> 01:44.269
Our neighbour -
walked in here and...

01:45.405 --> 01:46.805
- Well, saw this.
- Afternoon, gentlemen.

01:46.807 --> 01:49.741
It was my wife who found him.
Isn't that right, sue?

01:49.877 --> 01:50.876
Yes.

01:50.878 --> 01:52.411
What did you see, mrs...?

01:52.413 --> 01:53.845
Ah, billingsley.

01:54.715 --> 01:57.282
He was... Dead.

01:57.417 --> 01:59.851
Just lying there.
Just like that.

01:59.887 --> 02:01.252
You didn't see what happened?

02:02.256 --> 02:03.622
Did anyone see what happened?

02:03.691 --> 02:04.923
We didn't see a thing.

02:05.058 --> 02:06.959
I didn't even arrive
until after it happened.

02:07.094 --> 02:08.726
Ah! An army man.

02:08.762 --> 02:09.895
Yes, sir.

02:09.964 --> 02:12.631
Your undershirt's showing.
Very sloppy!

02:12.700 --> 02:15.234
A soldier is only
as fine as his uniform.

02:15.236 --> 02:17.535
- Keep an eye on that, son.
- Mm-hm.

02:19.039 --> 02:21.105
Who was the deceased?
A guest?

02:21.142 --> 02:23.008
Yes. Mr. Albert waxworthy.

02:23.010 --> 02:25.510
A bachelor, so he came alone,
of course.

02:25.546 --> 02:27.579
He works for my husband,
lyle anderson.

02:27.615 --> 02:28.747
Of anderson insurance?

02:28.882 --> 02:30.081
And where is your husband?

02:30.117 --> 02:32.217
Oh! Honey? Here he is.

02:34.622 --> 02:36.455
- Tere--
- terrible!

02:36.590 --> 02:38.523
Terrible business.
I know.

02:38.592 --> 02:41.192
Gentlemen, thank you so much
for coming.

02:41.228 --> 02:42.860
I'm lyle anderson.

02:43.464 --> 02:44.462
And you are?

02:52.940 --> 02:54.906
Why did it have to be you two?

02:55.943 --> 02:57.542
What the bloody hell's
going on, meyers?

02:58.278 --> 03:00.479
Who is lyle anderson?

03:01.182 --> 03:02.748
I am lyle anderson.

03:03.651 --> 03:06.051
Terence meyers is
my spy name.

03:07.321 --> 03:09.487
You've unfortunately
stumbled into my civilian life.

03:10.124 --> 03:11.623
Who is the dead man?

03:11.625 --> 03:12.958
Waxworthy.

03:13.027 --> 03:14.226
He worked for me.

03:14.361 --> 03:15.227
As a spy?

03:15.229 --> 03:17.428
No.
As an insurance salesman.

03:17.464 --> 03:20.098
You actually own
an insurance company?

03:20.234 --> 03:21.433
Yes, I do.

03:21.502 --> 03:23.502
- Anderson insurance.
- Ah...

03:23.504 --> 03:25.637
I think margaret bought
an annuity from you.

03:25.673 --> 03:27.172
And that is a fine investment,
tom.

03:27.241 --> 03:28.707
Ah.

03:28.709 --> 03:31.042
So, that's really your wife?

03:31.078 --> 03:33.045
And those are your children?

03:33.047 --> 03:34.312
Yes, they are.

03:35.649 --> 03:36.915
Who killed waxworthy then?

03:37.050 --> 03:38.350
I have no idea.

03:38.352 --> 03:40.385
- Well, must have been a spy.
- Certainly not.

03:40.387 --> 03:42.521
I am exceedingly cautious.

03:42.656 --> 03:45.724
Nobody that knows terence meyers
knows about lyle anderson.

03:45.726 --> 03:48.527
And nobody that knows anderson
knows about meyers.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.963
Mrs. Hart is on her way
here now.

03:52.566 --> 03:54.666
No. Call her off.

03:54.702 --> 03:56.835
Someone needs to examine
the body.

03:56.904 --> 03:59.137
Your wife, then.
She can be trusted.

03:59.273 --> 04:01.273
If no one in this house
knows you're a spy,

04:01.342 --> 04:03.875
Then why is there a man
lying on your living room floor

04:03.877 --> 04:05.010
With a knife stuck
in his back?

04:06.080 --> 04:08.680
People kill for all kinds
of reasons, tom.

04:08.815 --> 04:10.682
But this most certainly

04:10.684 --> 04:13.018
Is not a matter
of national security.

04:14.955 --> 04:16.921
(string music)

04:18.558 --> 04:21.293
Oh! Uh, I know it's not
an appropriate time for cake,

04:21.428 --> 04:23.362
But we have to eat something
and, uh,

04:23.364 --> 04:24.696
I'm hardly able to cook.

04:24.831 --> 04:26.931
Leave it on the table for me,
will you please, dear?

04:27.001 --> 04:28.333
Junior!

04:28.335 --> 04:30.401
What'd I tell you about touching
my train set?

04:30.437 --> 04:32.437
(scoffs)
I didn't even do anything.

04:32.572 --> 04:34.939
You're such a stick in the mud,
you know that?

04:36.910 --> 04:38.510
You're getting that hair cut,
young man!

04:38.512 --> 04:39.778
Yes, sir.

04:39.780 --> 04:40.712
Right, then.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.916
We need to know
where everyone was

04:44.918 --> 04:47.585
The moment that mr. Waxworthy's
body was found.

04:47.621 --> 04:50.021
Ah, well we were all over
the place, weren't we dear?

04:50.057 --> 04:52.124
I'm afraid so.
We were playing cats and dogs.

04:52.259 --> 04:53.558
Cats and dogs?

04:53.560 --> 04:55.193
It's a parlour game, murdoch.

04:55.195 --> 04:56.995
Margaret loves to play it
all the time.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.397
You hide playing cards
all around the house.

04:59.433 --> 05:01.799
One team searches for
red cards, the other for black.

05:01.835 --> 05:03.301
Two cards per player.

05:03.304 --> 05:05.971
My husband and I were team
captains, so we hid the cards.

05:06.106 --> 05:08.407
You search all over
and when you find one,

05:08.409 --> 05:11.743
You bark or meow, depending
on what team you're on.

05:11.745 --> 05:15.347
The last time I saw
mr. Waxworthy was in
the back garden.

05:15.349 --> 05:18.016
You were searching for cards
in the back garden?

05:18.085 --> 05:19.884
You're permitted to hide
them anywhere.

05:19.953 --> 05:22.554
I was in the kitchen and could
hear them through the window.

05:22.689 --> 05:24.889
I overheard them talking
about birds.

05:24.925 --> 05:26.591
Mm-hm. We spotted some
lovely warblers.

05:26.727 --> 05:28.093
I was in the garden,
as well.

05:28.162 --> 05:30.629
Waxworthy went inside,
but deborah and I remained.

05:31.965 --> 05:33.898
That was only a minute
or two before I

05:33.934 --> 05:36.033
Came in here and saw him.

05:37.704 --> 05:40.438
We need to track
all of the guests' movements.

05:41.375 --> 05:44.176
We should interview them
separately.

05:44.178 --> 05:47.178
Right. Do you want the cats
or the dogs?

05:48.515 --> 05:50.115
(city rumble)

05:51.385 --> 05:54.319
Hello, youths. You wanted
to speak with a detective?

05:54.454 --> 05:57.389
We'd like to report a missing
person: Coach keen.

05:57.524 --> 05:58.657
What did he coach?

05:58.659 --> 06:01.192
Basketball. We're the carlton
street stallions.

06:02.062 --> 06:03.795
And when did you see him last?

06:03.831 --> 06:05.063
Two hours ago.

06:05.132 --> 06:07.265
He was meant to be back
in 30 minutes.

06:07.267 --> 06:08.934
We found this in the alley.

06:09.069 --> 06:10.101
It's his hat.

06:11.004 --> 06:12.670
- Looks like blood.
- Ah.

06:13.340 --> 06:14.473
Where was he off to?

06:14.475 --> 06:16.208
He was just going down
the street to buy uniforms.

06:16.343 --> 06:18.577
We all chipped in and
gave him seven dollars.

06:18.579 --> 06:20.044
You paid for them yourselves?

06:20.114 --> 06:21.246
Yeah. We have money.

06:21.315 --> 06:23.014
- You can't prove we stole it.
- Oh.

06:23.050 --> 06:26.484
Right. So, this coach keen
went off to buy uniforms

06:26.553 --> 06:28.252
And then never came back?

06:29.323 --> 06:31.223
Is there anything
you can tell us about him?

06:31.358 --> 06:32.757
- He's short.
- Hm.

06:32.760 --> 06:35.227
- And dirty.
- And he has a mustache.

06:35.229 --> 06:36.394
An ugly one.

06:37.398 --> 06:39.964
How long have you lads known
this chap?

06:40.000 --> 06:41.333
Since yesterday.

06:41.335 --> 06:43.235
You need an adult to sign up for
the basketball league,

06:43.370 --> 06:45.303
So we saw one and
we asked him.

06:46.006 --> 06:47.839
Right, well, we'll...

06:47.875 --> 06:49.640
We'll see what we can do,
lads.

06:53.113 --> 06:54.045
(ogden): Hello?

06:54.047 --> 06:55.012
Oh.

06:55.515 --> 06:56.981
Ah, julia!

06:57.017 --> 06:58.416
Thank you for coming.

06:59.553 --> 07:01.253
Well, it was a treat to get out
of the house.

07:01.388 --> 07:03.721
But why did you need me here
instead of miss--

07:03.757 --> 07:07.192
It's a bit of a delicate
situation, actually.

07:07.194 --> 07:11.329
Dr. Julia ogden, allow me
to introduce you to

07:11.365 --> 07:13.397
Lyle anderson.

07:14.034 --> 07:15.400
(chuckles)

07:15.469 --> 07:16.734
Lyle anderson?

07:16.804 --> 07:18.469
You're lyle anderson,
are you?

07:18.505 --> 07:19.737
Yes, I am.

07:20.441 --> 07:21.173
Oh.

07:22.209 --> 07:23.942
Of course, you are.

07:25.145 --> 07:27.112
I believe what julia
is trying to say is that

07:27.247 --> 07:29.414
She recognizes your name
from purchasing

07:29.416 --> 07:31.082
Your insurance products.

07:31.084 --> 07:32.150
- Oh!
- I see. Yes.

07:32.152 --> 07:34.019
Oh, yes!

07:34.154 --> 07:36.120
(chuckles)
that's right.

07:36.190 --> 07:37.555
Anderson insurance.

07:40.561 --> 07:42.460
Well, why don't I get down
to work?

07:43.096 --> 07:44.495
Hm.

07:44.531 --> 07:45.830
Strange people.

07:46.867 --> 07:48.066
Right, then.

07:48.135 --> 07:50.468
Mrs. Anderson stated
that the murder weapon

07:50.504 --> 07:52.436
Came from the kitchen.

07:52.473 --> 07:54.172
Did anyone report being
in there?

07:55.209 --> 07:56.975
I was there earlier in
the afternoon.

07:57.044 --> 07:58.710
And your wife, after that.

07:58.845 --> 08:00.512
Everyone was in there
at some point.

08:00.647 --> 08:02.113
Well, whoever it was,

08:02.249 --> 08:05.583
The circumstances
of this suggest that it
was premeditated.

08:05.652 --> 08:08.119
Did anyone you spoke with
suggest a reason why

08:08.255 --> 08:10.454
Someone would want to kill
mr. Waxworthy?

08:10.491 --> 08:13.324
- No one.
- Everyone loved the old fella.

08:13.360 --> 08:15.860
Same with everyone I spoke to.

08:17.130 --> 08:19.697
Something isn't right.

08:19.766 --> 08:22.366
Oh, it's just a bloody sketch.
Here we go.

08:23.303 --> 08:24.969
Your daughter was in
the cloakroom.

08:25.906 --> 08:28.273
Bud kitterman had not
yet arrived.

08:29.543 --> 08:31.409
Junior was upstairs.

08:31.478 --> 08:34.779
Mrs. Anderson was in the garden
with mr. Billingsley.

08:34.915 --> 08:36.248
I was here,

08:37.217 --> 08:39.017
Coming out of
the water closet.

08:40.621 --> 08:43.321
Mrs. Billingsley discovered
mr. Waxworthy's body
in the living room.

08:43.323 --> 08:45.423
Now, if we assume that
mr. Waxworthy was killed

08:45.492 --> 08:47.425
Moments before his body
was discovered,

08:48.495 --> 08:50.495
The only person
who could have slipped

08:50.564 --> 08:54.299
Into the living room unseen
was your daughter.

08:54.368 --> 08:56.301
Lorraine anderson.

08:57.704 --> 09:00.972
I was in the kitchen when
I heard mrs. Billingsley scream.

09:01.942 --> 09:03.775
Where were you right
before that?

09:03.844 --> 09:06.778
Um, I was in the cloakroom
searching for playing cards.

09:06.780 --> 09:08.346
I'd been there, maybe,
a few minutes.

09:09.416 --> 09:10.916
So, a few minutes before
the body was found,

09:11.051 --> 09:12.717
You'd also been in
the living room.

09:12.719 --> 09:14.519
- Was anyone there?
- No one.

09:14.521 --> 09:17.322
Mr. Waxworthy had not yet
entered the room.

09:17.457 --> 09:20.124
So, while you were in
the cloakroom

09:20.193 --> 09:23.562
Did you hear anything
happening in the living room?

09:23.697 --> 09:25.196
I heard someone whistling.

09:25.265 --> 09:26.331
(whistles)

09:26.466 --> 09:27.632
Birdsong.

09:27.767 --> 09:30.001
Waxworthy was discussing
warblers in the garden.

09:30.136 --> 09:33.404
Then the whistling stopped
and there was a sound.

09:34.541 --> 09:36.007
What sound, honey?

09:36.142 --> 09:38.677
Ah, it was a sort of clunk.

09:38.679 --> 09:39.744
A clunk?

09:39.879 --> 09:40.979
Can you elaborate?

09:41.114 --> 09:43.348
I don't know how to describe it.
It was a clunk.

09:43.350 --> 09:45.617
A minute or so later
I came out of the cloakroom.

09:45.619 --> 09:47.284
Waxworthy must have been there.

09:47.321 --> 09:49.020
No. No.
The living room was empty.

09:49.155 --> 09:50.688
It was dark because the drapes
were drawn,

09:50.757 --> 09:52.691
But I'm sure mr. Waxworthy
was not there.

09:53.427 --> 09:54.558
The drapes were drawn?

09:54.595 --> 09:55.726
Yes.

09:55.762 --> 09:56.828
Why?

09:57.597 --> 09:58.963
Come on now, detective.

09:58.999 --> 10:01.232
Cats and dogs is
all the more fun in the dark.

10:01.234 --> 10:02.567
It is, actually.

10:08.175 --> 10:10.375
The coach never made it to pick
up the uniforms.

10:10.444 --> 10:11.576
Are you sure?

10:11.645 --> 10:14.512
Somewhere between that alley
and here is where he...

10:15.616 --> 10:18.582
Well, where something happened.

10:19.586 --> 10:21.419
Well, maybe there was
an accident...

10:21.421 --> 10:23.088
He saved somebody's life?

10:23.223 --> 10:25.089
I mean, that would explain
the bloo--

10:25.992 --> 10:29.260
Or maybe he fell into
the sewer

10:29.296 --> 10:32.063
And was sucked into the deep
by the creatures

10:32.132 --> 10:33.731
That dwell therein.
Watts?

10:34.501 --> 10:35.667
Hm? Yes.

10:35.802 --> 10:37.735
- Yes, what?
- I agree with you.

10:37.771 --> 10:38.937
Agree with what?

10:39.072 --> 10:40.338
What?

10:42.342 --> 10:43.475
What's that?

10:49.482 --> 10:51.515
"uniforms."

10:53.220 --> 10:55.286
(watts): The envelope the money
was in, perhaps.

10:56.590 --> 10:57.955
(crabtree): There's blood on it.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.223
(watts): Uh-huh.

11:03.830 --> 11:06.297
Well, he was stabbed, clearly.

11:06.366 --> 11:09.366
Large kitchen knife buried
five inches into his back.

11:10.437 --> 11:11.702
It's been wiped clean.

11:11.738 --> 11:13.771
I doubt very much I'll be able
to obtain fingermarks.

11:13.807 --> 11:15.873
Also, it seems the body
was moved.

11:15.875 --> 11:17.976
(brackenreid):
Ah, the bunched-up sweater.

11:17.978 --> 11:20.712
Yes. He seems to have been
dragged by his feet.

11:20.847 --> 11:22.714
If he was dragged
in a straight line,

11:22.783 --> 11:25.649
Then he may have been killed
by this bookcase, but...

11:25.686 --> 11:27.185
No sign of anything.

11:27.187 --> 11:29.387
Perhaps he was dragged in
from another room?

11:29.389 --> 11:31.923
Or the killer began dragging
the body but was interrupted.

11:32.992 --> 11:34.792
We've been unable
to determine motive

11:34.828 --> 11:37.261
For anyone wanting
to kill mr. Waxworthy.

11:38.365 --> 11:40.865
Perhaps this is
a case of mistaken identity?

11:40.867 --> 11:43.134
And who was he mistaken for?

11:49.476 --> 11:50.675
Similar sweater.

11:50.744 --> 11:52.676
Same build, same hair.

11:52.713 --> 11:55.213
I find it far more likely
that someone would want to kill

11:55.282 --> 11:58.349
A secret agent over
an insurance salesman.

11:58.418 --> 11:59.817
Oh, I don't know about that,
murdoch.

11:59.886 --> 12:01.285
They're all smarmy buggers.

12:02.222 --> 12:05.089
Mr. Anderson!
Do not eat that!

12:05.559 --> 12:07.091
What? Why?

12:08.495 --> 12:09.728
Look.

12:09.863 --> 12:12.430
Discoloration where it was
touching the cake,

12:12.499 --> 12:13.964
Oxidization.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.399
If it's aluminum--

12:15.435 --> 12:17.168
Then it could be reacting
to lye.

12:17.738 --> 12:19.737
Mr. Anderson,

12:20.807 --> 12:22.974
I believe someone may be
trying to kill you.

12:25.311 --> 12:27.244
(dramatic music)

12:34.755 --> 12:36.053
(murdoch): I hate to say it,

12:36.089 --> 12:38.055
But if someone is trying
to kill you...

12:38.792 --> 12:40.658
Murdoch, I can assure you

12:40.660 --> 12:43.528
This is not a matter of
national security.

12:43.530 --> 12:44.929
Nobody in this house

12:45.064 --> 12:47.599
Knows of the existence
of terence meyers.

12:47.601 --> 12:50.468
Maybe one of your friends
isn't such a friend after all?

12:51.371 --> 12:53.738
I've known my wife for
18 years.

12:53.740 --> 12:56.006
I've watched both
of my children being born.

12:56.042 --> 12:59.677
The billingsleys have been our
neighbours for over a decade.

12:59.713 --> 13:02.947
None of them, I assure you,
none of them suspect a thing.

13:04.884 --> 13:06.483
What of your daughter's...

13:06.520 --> 13:07.685
Escort?

13:07.687 --> 13:11.088
Bud kitterman.
I don't like him.

13:11.158 --> 13:13.657
I don't trust him.
He's no good.

13:16.429 --> 13:20.297
But I have scrutinized
his parents, his grandparents

13:20.333 --> 13:23.634
And every single one of
his relatives living and dead.

13:23.703 --> 13:27.204
Murdoch, I've been
in his bedroom
when he's asleep at night.

13:29.175 --> 13:31.709
He's a sorry excuse for a man,
but he's no spy.

13:31.711 --> 13:34.445
So, you think someone is trying
to kill lyle anderson,

13:34.514 --> 13:36.214
Not terence meyers?

13:36.283 --> 13:37.582
So it would seem.

13:37.651 --> 13:40.251
Why would anyone want
to do that?

13:40.386 --> 13:42.286
I haven't the foggiest.

13:43.924 --> 13:45.323
You moved the body?

13:45.325 --> 13:47.725
To the spare bedroom.
Quite the heavy chap.

13:48.461 --> 13:49.594
What have you learned?

13:49.596 --> 13:52.063
The rest of the cake
isn't reacting to aluminum

13:52.065 --> 13:55.132
And no one got sick. I believe
mr. Anderson's piece of cake

13:55.168 --> 13:56.534
Was the only one
poisoned.

13:57.370 --> 13:58.670
And the lye?

13:59.739 --> 14:01.805
Mrs. Anderson keeps some
under the sink.

14:01.842 --> 14:05.610
His piece of cake was
left out on the table for at
least 15 minutes.

14:05.745 --> 14:08.679
Meaning anyone could have
accessed the lye in the kitchen

14:08.748 --> 14:10.682
And sprinkled some
on his piece of cake.

14:10.817 --> 14:12.116
True.

14:12.118 --> 14:14.418
But his wife's the one who
served it to him.

14:19.559 --> 14:21.759
(deborah): You think I tried to
kill my own husband?

14:21.761 --> 14:25.029
You were the one who served him
a poisoned slice of cake.

14:26.099 --> 14:27.564
Well, why would I do such
an awful thing?

14:27.601 --> 14:29.233
I couldn't wish
for a better husband.

14:29.269 --> 14:31.769
Lyle is truly a good and
honest man.

14:31.838 --> 14:33.872
Well, that doesn't mean
you didn't want to kill him.

14:34.007 --> 14:36.307
Wives kill their husbands for
all kinds of reasons:

14:36.442 --> 14:38.709
Infidelity, bankruptcy,

14:38.778 --> 14:41.045
Drunkenness, slovenliness.

14:41.047 --> 14:42.479
A cold demeanour.

14:44.384 --> 14:45.917
What of the other guests?

14:45.919 --> 14:48.386
Do you know of any reason
why any of them

14:48.521 --> 14:49.987
Would wish your husband harm?

14:50.423 --> 14:51.522
No.

14:52.659 --> 14:55.192
Mrs. Anderson,
someone has tried to kill him

14:55.228 --> 14:56.927
And may try to do so again.

14:56.963 --> 14:58.863
Please, if you know something,
tell us.

14:58.998 --> 15:01.099
He wouldn't have done anything,
not really.

15:01.101 --> 15:02.766
- Who?
- Just tell them, mom.

15:02.802 --> 15:04.168
Lorraine, shh.

15:04.170 --> 15:05.703
(ogden): Tell us what?

15:05.838 --> 15:07.604
Don't mind her.
She gets ideas in her head.

15:07.641 --> 15:09.740
In my head?
He's the one with the ideas.

15:09.776 --> 15:11.609
- Lorraine!
- Mrs. Anderson, please.

15:11.678 --> 15:12.744
What are these?

15:12.879 --> 15:15.446
Proof. Junior's been wanting
to kill dad for years.

15:17.450 --> 15:19.350
(intriguing music)

15:26.793 --> 15:27.992
(junior): I didn't do it.

15:29.496 --> 15:32.630
These drawings of yours
certainly suggest you wanted
to kill him.

15:32.632 --> 15:35.366
Ah.
Those are just for fun.

15:35.368 --> 15:37.769
(brackenreid): Your father's
being ripped apart by lions.

15:37.904 --> 15:39.270
That's fun?

15:39.405 --> 15:41.472
(chuckles)
yes.

15:42.475 --> 15:44.241
You're being accused
of murder, son.

15:45.412 --> 15:47.378
You stated that
you went upstairs to your room

15:47.380 --> 15:50.448
Shortly after
dogs and cats began.

15:50.583 --> 15:52.917
I found a couple of cards
and quit.

15:53.052 --> 15:54.686
I hate that stupid game.

15:54.821 --> 15:56.654
And you didn't come out
of your room until you heard

15:56.723 --> 15:58.122
Mrs. Billingsley scream?

15:58.992 --> 16:00.725
I was up there the whole time.

16:00.794 --> 16:02.326
We'll ask everyone if
they saw you.

16:02.362 --> 16:03.327
Are you sure?

16:04.597 --> 16:06.264
Why would I kill him,
anyways, hm?

16:06.399 --> 16:09.800
Why would I stab
a man in the living room
of a crowded party

16:09.836 --> 16:12.270
When I could just as easily
go upstairs while he's asleep,

16:12.405 --> 16:14.339
Smother him with a pillow.

16:14.474 --> 16:16.140
Grab the bag that I packed
in advance,

16:16.142 --> 16:17.942
Walk 15 minutes
to the train station,

16:17.944 --> 16:20.210
Take the midnight express
to pennsylvania before dawn?

16:20.246 --> 16:21.479
Hm?

16:25.218 --> 16:28.286
I'll ask the other guests, but
I tend to believe him.

16:28.421 --> 16:30.288
Aren't you going to ask me
who did it?

16:30.423 --> 16:31.622
Did what?

16:31.691 --> 16:33.157
Tried to kill my father.

16:33.292 --> 16:35.560
It's obvious, isn't it?

16:35.562 --> 16:38.629
Bud came from out of town
to visit dad.

16:38.665 --> 16:40.832
He wanted to ask lorraine
to marry him.

16:40.967 --> 16:42.366
Dad said no.

16:43.302 --> 16:45.035
Mr. Kitterman had not yet
arrived.

16:46.373 --> 16:48.773
I wouldn't be so sure,
murdoch.

16:48.775 --> 16:50.140
I think he had.

16:51.244 --> 16:53.644
My guess would be whoever
bloodied the hat

16:53.680 --> 16:54.779
Stole the money.

16:54.781 --> 16:56.381
Perhaps someone saw
something?

16:56.516 --> 16:57.782
You there!

16:57.851 --> 16:59.117
Have you been here long?

16:59.252 --> 17:01.185
All afternoon.
Why?

17:01.320 --> 17:03.788
We're looking for a chap
by the name of keen,

17:03.923 --> 17:05.322
A basketball coach.

17:05.392 --> 17:07.058
Oh, yeah.
I know him.

17:07.060 --> 17:08.258
Really?

17:08.294 --> 17:10.027
Sure, I play basketballs
every Saturday.

17:10.030 --> 17:10.862
(crabtree): You do?

17:10.997 --> 17:12.530
Well, when I'm not mountain
climbing.

17:12.532 --> 17:13.997
Ah! Very funny.

17:14.034 --> 17:15.999
Look, we think this chap may
have been injured

17:16.036 --> 17:18.002
In the vicinity over
the last couple of hours.

17:18.071 --> 17:19.870
He's described as...

17:19.906 --> 17:22.406
Short, dirty, mustached

17:22.475 --> 17:24.408
And in possession of
seven dollars.

17:24.444 --> 17:26.577
Describes half
the drunks in this town,

17:26.613 --> 17:27.945
Except for
the seven dollars part.

17:29.315 --> 17:30.881
Drunks.

17:36.355 --> 17:37.822
Oh, no.

17:41.227 --> 17:43.360
(laughter)

17:44.531 --> 17:45.663
(brackenreid): When did you
arrive at the party

17:45.732 --> 17:46.697
This afternoon, kitterman?

17:46.699 --> 17:48.032
Just after the murder.

17:48.034 --> 17:50.567
I heard miss billingsley scream
as I came up the front walk.

17:50.603 --> 17:52.370
Are you sure about that, son?

17:52.505 --> 17:54.571
Yes. Of course.

17:55.308 --> 17:56.974
You're looking very smart.

17:57.010 --> 17:58.809
I am an army man, sir.

18:00.080 --> 18:01.579
When we arrived,

18:01.581 --> 18:04.048
Your undershirt was showing
and your collar was unbuttoned.

18:04.183 --> 18:06.150
I fixed it for you.

18:06.152 --> 18:07.652
There was something on
your undershirt.

18:07.787 --> 18:09.453
Pull your shirt up.

18:16.729 --> 18:17.995
What is that?

18:18.131 --> 18:19.263
Is that blood?

18:19.398 --> 18:20.998
(brackenreid): Lipstick.

18:21.901 --> 18:22.933
Wha--

18:22.969 --> 18:24.268
(sputters)

18:25.839 --> 18:28.105
You were wearing lipstick?

18:29.409 --> 18:31.976
(murdoch): There is only one
explanation, mr. Kitterman,

18:32.045 --> 18:34.145
You lied to us.
You were here.

18:35.281 --> 18:36.814
You were kissing miss anderson
in the cloakroom

18:36.883 --> 18:38.483
Just before the murder.

18:40.887 --> 18:41.819
It's true.

18:41.888 --> 18:43.421
It's all true.

18:50.763 --> 18:52.496
I lied about when I arrived
at the party,

18:52.499 --> 18:53.631
But I didn't kill anyone.

18:54.700 --> 18:56.233
What time did you get here?

18:56.269 --> 18:57.735
Around 2:30.

18:57.737 --> 18:59.837
It was probably 15 minutes
before the scream.

18:59.906 --> 19:01.572
(brackenreid): What happened
when you came inside?

19:01.608 --> 19:03.474
It was dark.

19:03.543 --> 19:05.910
The only person in the living
room was lorraine.

19:06.045 --> 19:09.046
She said that she wanted
to show me something and,

19:09.082 --> 19:10.747
Well, we went into
the cloakroom.

19:12.352 --> 19:14.318
So, no one else
saw you come inside?

19:14.387 --> 19:17.521
No. That's why we thought we
could have some time alone to...

19:17.557 --> 19:18.989
To what son, hm?

19:20.326 --> 19:22.326
What were you doing with
my daughter?

19:22.896 --> 19:24.361
Kissing?

19:25.464 --> 19:28.466
And when did you come out
of the cloakroom?

19:28.601 --> 19:30.434
A few minutes later.

19:30.937 --> 19:32.002
Waxworthy?

19:33.139 --> 19:35.072
We heard him whistling,
but he wasn't there.

19:35.141 --> 19:36.673
- No dead body?
- No!

19:36.709 --> 19:38.476
I swear.
Everything was normal.

19:38.478 --> 19:40.344
I went back out the front door

19:40.479 --> 19:42.479
So I could pretend to
arrive so...

19:42.515 --> 19:45.382
Mr. Anderson wouldn't know that
I'd been alone with lorraine.

19:45.418 --> 19:47.218
You little snake.

19:47.287 --> 19:49.286
You were there. Hm?

19:49.422 --> 19:52.155
You killed waxworthy
because you thought you were
killing me!

19:52.192 --> 19:54.992
Mr. Anderson,
should we get some fresh air?

19:59.032 --> 20:01.498
Well, that boy's life is worth
next to nothing.

20:01.534 --> 20:04.201
He seems like a thoroughly
decent chap.

20:04.336 --> 20:05.603
Not good enough for
my daughter.

20:05.672 --> 20:07.505
Well, regardless of
his character,

20:07.640 --> 20:10.140
The sequence of events
doesn't make sense.

20:10.210 --> 20:13.978
He would have to have
gone straight from kissing
young miss...

20:13.980 --> 20:17.180
Anderson to locating
mr. Waxworthy,

20:17.217 --> 20:19.350
Stabbing him,
then dragging his body

20:19.485 --> 20:22.119
To the middle of the living room
for no apparent reason...

20:22.121 --> 20:24.588
Then going about his day as if
nothing had happened.

20:24.591 --> 20:26.256
Yeah. You're right.

20:27.426 --> 20:29.326
Boy doesn't have a backbone
to murder anybody.

20:29.362 --> 20:30.928
He is an army man.

20:31.063 --> 20:32.596
He enlisted last week.

20:33.433 --> 20:34.831
Ah!

20:36.436 --> 20:38.736
Sir, perhaps we ought
to speak with the person who
discovered the body?

20:39.339 --> 20:40.704
(birds chirping)

20:41.841 --> 20:43.373
Mrs. Billingsley,

20:44.610 --> 20:46.277
Before you found mr. Waxworthy
in the living room,

20:46.412 --> 20:48.346
Are you sure you saw no one
else there?

20:48.348 --> 20:49.680
Positively.

20:49.716 --> 20:52.383
And mr. Waxworthy was dead?

20:52.518 --> 20:54.118
Yes, of course.

20:54.887 --> 20:56.486
Where did you enter from?

20:56.522 --> 20:58.255
The back door there.

20:58.258 --> 21:01.391
I went through the kitchen and
into the living room.

21:03.162 --> 21:04.828
And did you see anyone else
along the way?

21:04.864 --> 21:07.197
No. Yes!

21:07.233 --> 21:11.702
Lorraine was coming past me
out to the garden.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.704
Then where was bloody
waxworthy?

21:13.839 --> 21:15.773
Two people said
the living room was empty

21:15.775 --> 21:17.975
And less than a minute later
you found him dead.

21:18.044 --> 21:19.310
Now that doesn't really add up,
does it?

21:19.445 --> 21:22.046
Easy, now.
My wife did nothing wrong.

21:22.048 --> 21:23.648
How can you be so sure?

21:23.783 --> 21:25.248
You were sitting out here
the whole time.

21:25.285 --> 21:28.085
My wife is not a murderer, sir.
How dare you?

21:28.087 --> 21:30.388
I dare because she's the only
one who could have done it.

21:30.390 --> 21:32.556
Isn't that right, murdoch?
Murdoch?

21:33.059 --> 21:34.325
Sir.

21:34.327 --> 21:35.526
The wall.

21:36.729 --> 21:38.528
There's something not quite
right about it.

21:41.067 --> 21:42.600
Another round!

21:43.536 --> 21:45.136
Uh, I'm afraid not, barkeep.

21:45.138 --> 21:47.138
Mr. Keen here has just run out
of money.

21:47.273 --> 21:48.939
What in tarnation?

21:49.008 --> 21:50.674
What are you doing in here?

21:50.710 --> 21:52.476
Those kids are waiting on
their uniforms.

21:52.478 --> 21:53.477
What kids?

21:53.546 --> 21:55.012
What uniforms?

21:55.081 --> 21:57.948
The uniforms this money
was meant to buy.

21:57.950 --> 21:59.216
They trusted you.

21:59.285 --> 22:00.818
They just wanted
to play basketball.

22:00.820 --> 22:02.887
They're street rats.

22:02.889 --> 22:04.889
Barkeep.
Another round.

22:05.024 --> 22:06.223
We thought you'd been
attacked.

22:06.259 --> 22:07.624
I was.

22:07.660 --> 22:10.394
Me and him been at it since
we was kids.

22:10.530 --> 22:11.962
All right! Stop it.

22:12.098 --> 22:13.564
I've got half a mind
to arrest you.

22:13.633 --> 22:15.565
Now, where's the rest of
the seven dollars?

22:15.601 --> 22:16.967
You're holding it.

22:17.036 --> 22:18.902
Hm. He's not worth
the hot meal.

22:18.938 --> 22:20.504
With me, constable.

22:23.910 --> 22:26.810
The study ends at this wall.

22:27.780 --> 22:30.180
The kitchen only extends
to that one.

22:31.217 --> 22:33.383
The exterior of the house
is continuous.

22:33.419 --> 22:34.484
What are you saying?

22:36.155 --> 22:38.789
There is something behind
this bookcase.

22:38.858 --> 22:40.724
You think there's something
hidden there?

22:40.793 --> 22:43.394
Darling, would you please
go look in on the children?

22:43.529 --> 22:46.062
I'd like to have a word
with the detective alone.

22:46.099 --> 22:47.464
Whatever for?

22:47.500 --> 22:49.666
Oh, I shouldn't want
to worry you with it, dear.

22:49.702 --> 22:51.401
Of course, sweetheart.

22:59.946 --> 23:03.046
Time to come clean, "lyle".

23:05.084 --> 23:07.751
You may never speak a word
of this.

23:11.624 --> 23:14.425
(intriguing music)

23:21.768 --> 23:22.700
Ready?

23:22.835 --> 23:24.001
For what?

23:24.003 --> 23:25.735
<i> The birds of america.</i>

23:33.579 --> 23:37.314
You have a secret,
hidden lair in your home?

23:37.383 --> 23:38.716
Yeah.

23:38.718 --> 23:41.986
I use it to become
terence meyers.

23:41.988 --> 23:43.854
I can sneak in here without
my family noticing.

23:47.193 --> 23:49.292
What in the world?

23:50.830 --> 23:52.663
Why did you not tell us
about this?

23:52.732 --> 23:53.997
Because there was no need to.

23:54.066 --> 23:55.999
It has nothing to do with
the murder.

23:56.035 --> 23:59.870
Mr. Waxworthy's body
was dragged to the middle
of the living room,

23:59.872 --> 24:02.806
Likely from the direction of
this very bookcase.

24:02.842 --> 24:06.477
It's highly probable
that he was murdered here
and then dragged--

24:06.612 --> 24:09.079
It's not even remotely
probable.

24:09.115 --> 24:13.150
Nobody - but nobody - knows of
the existence of this room.

24:13.285 --> 24:14.785
How can you be so sure?

24:14.920 --> 24:18.689
Because my entire career,
my entire life, depends on no...

24:19.358 --> 24:20.958
Mr. Meyers?

24:22.061 --> 24:23.160
No.

24:23.729 --> 24:24.928
What is it?

24:27.099 --> 24:28.899
No, it can't be.

24:30.636 --> 24:31.902
(murdoch): What is that?

24:33.673 --> 24:35.973
This is a paradox machine.

24:36.108 --> 24:37.908
I use it to send
and receive coded messages.

24:38.043 --> 24:39.810
Well, whatever it is,
what's the problem?

24:41.046 --> 24:42.112
Problem...

24:43.782 --> 24:47.184
Every afternoon I come in here
to check for unread messages.

24:47.319 --> 24:50.387
This afternoon, I've not yet
done so because of the murder.

24:50.389 --> 24:52.189
So what?

24:52.191 --> 24:54.925
This machine was recently
outfitted with a new device.

24:55.060 --> 24:56.794
It's a clock,

24:56.796 --> 24:59.462
Which stops every time a new
message is read.

24:59.499 --> 25:02.333
The clock cannot be
restarted without this key.

25:03.402 --> 25:04.467
Ingenious.

25:04.504 --> 25:06.971
And this message was read
at 1:34.

25:07.106 --> 25:09.072
That would be after the guests
had arrived for the party.

25:09.141 --> 25:10.741
What did the message say?

25:10.743 --> 25:11.942
Well, it doesn't matter.

25:12.011 --> 25:13.877
Don't you see what's going
on here?

25:13.880 --> 25:17.347
It means some foreign agent
of unknown allegiance

25:17.383 --> 25:20.650
Knows of my identity, broke
in here and read this message.

25:22.054 --> 25:24.688
This machine, and by extension
the government of canada,

25:24.823 --> 25:26.624
Has been compromised.

25:29.529 --> 25:32.029
I can't believe a man would do
something like that!

25:32.098 --> 25:33.764
And to children, no less.

25:33.766 --> 25:36.500
Man is defined by nothing
if not his failings.

25:36.502 --> 25:37.968
What will we do?

25:39.238 --> 25:41.038
Half of those children
probably live on the street.

25:41.040 --> 25:42.372
They just want to play a game.

25:42.441 --> 25:44.909
Well, we find them
a new coach.

25:45.044 --> 25:48.044
And another seven dollars
for uniforms.

25:48.080 --> 25:49.713
Ah, well, six.

25:49.848 --> 25:51.648
But, yes, you're right.

25:51.717 --> 25:52.983
That's what we'll do.

25:57.356 --> 25:58.521
In fact...

26:02.661 --> 26:03.893
(watts): What are you doing?

26:04.897 --> 26:06.463
Articulate your thoughts, man.

26:06.499 --> 26:07.530
Just...

26:10.235 --> 26:11.201
Oof.

26:11.203 --> 26:12.736
(murdoch): Mr. Meyers,

26:12.871 --> 26:15.272
You said this machine was
recently outfitted

26:15.341 --> 26:17.007
With the clock mechanism?

26:17.142 --> 26:18.676
Yesterday.

26:18.678 --> 26:20.744
Well, then it's entirely
possible that whoever read

26:20.746 --> 26:22.746
This message has been
reading

26:22.881 --> 26:25.015
All of your messages for
some time.

26:26.018 --> 26:27.217
Yes.

26:27.353 --> 26:28.819
- Dear god.
- So, this time,

26:28.888 --> 26:31.488
The spy saw
the clock contraption

26:31.524 --> 26:34.424
And knew that the moment
you came here and saw it,

26:34.460 --> 26:36.026
He'd be found out.

26:36.028 --> 26:38.762
Hm. He'd have to kill me before
I discovered it.

26:38.831 --> 26:41.498
What was waxworthy doing here?
Maybe he's the spy.

26:41.500 --> 26:43.166
The spy is not one of
the guests.

26:43.202 --> 26:45.569
The culprit likely
came from the outside.

26:45.571 --> 26:47.037
How is that possible?

26:49.041 --> 26:51.575
I have a secret passageway
that allows me to enter and exit

26:51.710 --> 26:53.377
The building without
being detected.

26:54.647 --> 26:57.314
You have a secret passageway
that would allow someone

26:57.316 --> 27:01.251
From the outside to enter
and exit this home undetected

27:01.253 --> 27:02.853
And you did not tell us
about it?

27:02.988 --> 27:04.220
Yeah.

27:04.256 --> 27:06.022
Now, if you'd like
to follow me.

27:11.597 --> 27:14.398
This whole area
is extremely private

27:14.400 --> 27:16.867
And I only enter and exit under
the cover of night,

27:16.936 --> 27:20.137
So it's very improbable
that any friend, family,

27:20.206 --> 27:22.338
Or neighbour would discover
this passageway.

27:22.375 --> 27:24.008
What's your theory, then?

27:24.143 --> 27:26.810
Clearly, this security breach
is the result

27:26.812 --> 27:29.345
Of an extensive
surveillance operation

27:29.382 --> 27:31.281
Conducted by an enemy state.

27:31.283 --> 27:32.882
What?
Watching your privet?

27:34.153 --> 27:36.486
Monitoring the entrance
to a top-secret

27:36.555 --> 27:38.422
Government facility,
inspector.

27:38.491 --> 27:40.490
Hidden behind your bookcase.

27:40.559 --> 27:43.494
I wonder who could have pulled
it off?

27:43.629 --> 27:46.763
The resources and ingenuity
would be extraordinary.

27:47.933 --> 27:50.100
(scoffs)
could be chernyshevsky,
the russians.

27:50.136 --> 27:51.835
There's something about this
whole thing

27:51.970 --> 27:54.038
That reeks of the germans.

27:54.173 --> 27:55.873
Ahlbecker.

27:55.875 --> 27:58.108
Or perhaps even
mademoiselle rivière...

27:58.243 --> 28:01.111
(murdoch): Mr. Meyers, I don't
care who did it.

28:01.147 --> 28:03.847
The fact that
you've hidden this lair

28:03.982 --> 28:06.183
And secret passageway
from us has rendered

28:06.252 --> 28:09.253
The entire investigation to
this point useless!

28:09.255 --> 28:10.988
(brackenreid): You've been lying
to us! Maybe you were the one

28:11.123 --> 28:13.156
That waxworthy saw walking
through the bookcase?

28:13.225 --> 28:15.058
You killed him to protect
your secret.

28:15.094 --> 28:17.995
And you've brought us in here to
play out a little charade

28:17.997 --> 28:19.997
For the benefit of
your wife and children.

28:20.132 --> 28:22.199
I admit your theory is
quite plausible.

28:22.268 --> 28:24.534
But I can assure you I'm far too
good of a spy

28:24.603 --> 28:25.835
To make that mistake.

28:26.972 --> 28:29.540
Have you used this passageway
since the murder?

28:30.743 --> 28:32.075
No. Why?

28:32.078 --> 28:33.676
Oh! Interesting.

28:34.346 --> 28:35.679
Why is that interesting?

28:35.814 --> 28:38.348
Because mr. Waxworthy
was a dog.

28:38.350 --> 28:39.482
(ogden): A what?

28:39.518 --> 28:41.684
Mr. Waxworthy was a dog.

28:42.554 --> 28:44.954
And this very red
playing card

28:44.990 --> 28:47.090
Was dropped inside
the secret passageway.

28:48.227 --> 28:49.893
The spy is a cat.

28:51.163 --> 28:55.031
Mr. Meyers, one of your
own guests has found you out.

28:56.235 --> 28:58.568
(suspenseful string music)

29:04.576 --> 29:05.843
Can't believe that.

29:05.978 --> 29:08.578
It's the only plausible
explanation.

29:08.614 --> 29:12.182
One of your guests or family
members is a secret agent.

29:12.251 --> 29:14.384
Working against you.
And you didn't even know it.

29:14.453 --> 29:16.119
(ogden): Who could it be?

29:16.155 --> 29:19.656
I believe this card will
lead us to the guilty party.

29:20.726 --> 29:22.326
Wait, murdoch.

29:22.461 --> 29:24.527
You can't question
anybody about that card.

29:24.563 --> 29:26.997
Why not? Whoever dropped it
is the killer.

29:27.132 --> 29:30.200
And the killer is an espionage
agent who must be found

29:30.269 --> 29:32.135
And delivered
to prime minister laurier.

29:32.204 --> 29:35.339
But everyone else out
there knows nothing about
the passageway,

29:35.474 --> 29:37.941
Nothing about the spy and
nothing about terence meyers.

29:39.011 --> 29:40.944
And it's imperative that
it be kept that way.

29:43.282 --> 29:45.281
I'm rounding up the cats
and dogs.

29:48.287 --> 29:49.520
Thank you, constable.

29:49.655 --> 29:51.021
Ah, enough of this "constable"
business.

29:51.156 --> 29:52.422
Call me coach.

29:53.526 --> 29:55.292
All right, lads,
let's get down to the gymnasium!

29:55.294 --> 29:56.560
We've got a game to play.

29:56.629 --> 29:59.029
(cheering)
let's go! Come on!

30:00.199 --> 30:02.566
Coach, are you quite sure
this was a good idea?

30:02.635 --> 30:04.901
Well, they seem like decent
lads. I think it could be fun.

30:04.970 --> 30:07.704
I meant the money stolen from
the station house.

30:08.941 --> 30:10.774
Well, the inspector
has enough scotch for now.

30:10.909 --> 30:13.310
I'm sure he won't mind missing
a few dollars from the kitty.

30:14.814 --> 30:16.813
Well, if he was there I'd have
asked him.

30:28.527 --> 30:30.527
(gentle music)

30:34.466 --> 30:35.532
(murdoch): Ladies and
gentlemen...

30:35.667 --> 30:38.268
There has been a development
in the case.

30:39.738 --> 30:43.140
This card was found in
an unusual place.

30:43.275 --> 30:46.276
- Murdoch--
- I will not tell you where
it was found,

30:46.345 --> 30:49.346
But four cats in this room

30:49.348 --> 30:52.949
Claim to have found
two red playing cards each.

30:53.085 --> 30:55.652
How you answer
the following question

30:55.654 --> 30:57.687
Will determine
the identity of the killer,

30:57.756 --> 30:59.722
So please answer
carefully.

31:01.026 --> 31:04.628
Lorraine, where did you find
your two red playing cards?

31:04.697 --> 31:08.365
Um, I found one in a coat pocket
in the cloakroom

31:08.367 --> 31:11.567
And the other was beneath
the cushion on that chair.

31:11.604 --> 31:13.270
Junior?
Your two cards?

31:13.405 --> 31:15.038
Under a mat
at the front door

31:15.040 --> 31:16.773
And on a table
by the cloakroom.

31:16.842 --> 31:19.542
Mr. Anderson,
the same question.

31:19.612 --> 31:23.180
Behind that painting
and on the bottom shelf
of the bookcase.

31:24.717 --> 31:26.116
Mrs. Billingsley?

31:27.519 --> 31:30.854
On the stove in the kitchen
and under this lampshade here.

31:32.457 --> 31:34.190
Thank you all very much.

31:34.226 --> 31:36.459
Our investigation has come
to an end.

31:36.528 --> 31:38.395
The killer
has revealed themselves.

31:40.366 --> 31:44.134
This card was the one hidden
under that lampshade

31:44.136 --> 31:47.537
And later discovered under
the dead body of mr. Waxworthy.

31:47.606 --> 31:49.672
Nonsense!
That's impossible.

31:49.708 --> 31:52.409
Inspector, please arrest
mrs. Billingsley

31:52.411 --> 31:54.578
For the murder
of albert waxworthy.

31:54.580 --> 31:57.280
No! It can't be.
I didn't...

31:57.316 --> 31:59.615
Julia, please take
the two young andersons outside

31:59.652 --> 32:01.217
To be certain
that they are all right.

32:01.253 --> 32:02.285
Of course.

32:02.354 --> 32:03.954
(brackenreid): Please come
with me, ma'am.

32:04.023 --> 32:05.288
I'll call a carriage, murdoch.

32:05.357 --> 32:06.489
Where are you taking her?

32:06.558 --> 32:07.824
Station house four.

32:07.893 --> 32:09.692
Best if you come along, as well,
mr. Billingsley.

32:09.728 --> 32:10.960
Ma'am?

32:10.996 --> 32:12.462
This is ridiculous.

32:17.236 --> 32:18.968
That was quite impressive,
murdoch.

32:20.172 --> 32:21.437
How did you know
that was the exact card found

32:21.473 --> 32:23.173
Under that lampshade?

32:23.175 --> 32:24.674
I didn't.

32:26.144 --> 32:27.511
Just a hunch?

32:27.513 --> 32:28.578
No.

32:29.415 --> 32:30.914
It simply isn't true.

32:32.117 --> 32:34.918
Accusing mrs. Billingsley
gave me the opportunity

32:34.987 --> 32:37.521
To interrogate
the real killer.

32:37.656 --> 32:40.057
If any of the four cats
were guilty,

32:40.059 --> 32:42.859
They would have lied about where
they found their playing cards.

32:44.396 --> 32:47.697
But all of their accounts
matched what mrs. Anderson
told us earlier.

32:49.001 --> 32:52.935
So, the only person who could
have dropped this card...

32:58.043 --> 33:00.143
The same person
who broke into your lair

33:00.212 --> 33:01.944
And read your secret message

33:01.981 --> 33:04.214
Off of your communication
device,

33:04.216 --> 33:08.851
Dropping this card
in her haste to escape.

33:16.061 --> 33:17.326
It is true.

33:17.896 --> 33:19.462
I am a spy.

33:21.367 --> 33:23.733
You tripped the clock
on the communication device.

33:24.770 --> 33:26.469
You dropped the card on
your way out.

33:27.573 --> 33:29.972
But how did waxworthy
end up dead?

33:30.009 --> 33:33.443
I wanted to go back into
the lair to try again to fix it.

33:34.446 --> 33:36.046
But he saw me stepping
into the privet.

33:37.049 --> 33:39.116
Once he knew,
he had to be eliminated.

33:39.251 --> 33:42.052
You have the authority to murder
citizens?

33:42.121 --> 33:45.122
I have the authority
to do what needs to be done.

33:46.225 --> 33:48.591
I distracted him with
talk of songbirds,

33:48.660 --> 33:50.927
Pretended to misidentify one

33:50.929 --> 33:52.895
And suggested he look at
<i> the birds of america.</i>

33:54.333 --> 33:57.600
<i> There's nothing men like more</i>
<i> than proving themselves right.</i>

33:59.638 --> 34:01.738
<i> (murdoch): You'd already</i>
<i> reset the train.</i>

34:04.143 --> 34:05.475
<i> Then took the knife from</i>
<i> the kitchen...</i>

34:05.610 --> 34:07.376
<i> And went back into the lair</i>

34:07.413 --> 34:09.011
<i> Through the secret passage</i>
<i> to lie in wait.</i>

34:10.516 --> 34:13.483
Once the bookcase turned,
I was ready.

34:14.353 --> 34:16.286
I threw the knife into
his back.

34:16.288 --> 34:18.688
He was dead before
he even knew what had happened.

34:18.724 --> 34:20.423
Why drag him
into the living room

34:20.492 --> 34:22.592
Where anyone could find him?

34:23.495 --> 34:25.162
If waxworthy simply
disappeared,

34:25.164 --> 34:27.564
I knew that lyle would
check his office.

34:27.699 --> 34:29.833
My only hope was that
the police would not find out

34:29.835 --> 34:32.502
The truth before I was able
to fix everything.

34:34.239 --> 34:35.505
Fix what?

34:36.241 --> 34:38.241
Eliminate the target.

34:40.112 --> 34:41.444
Who are you?

34:42.081 --> 34:43.446
What--

34:43.449 --> 34:45.749
Who do you work for?
When did they get to you?

34:45.884 --> 34:49.118
My name is laura söllner.

34:50.322 --> 34:52.522
I was born in vienna.

34:53.725 --> 34:57.393
I've been an agent of
the austro-hungarian empire

34:57.463 --> 35:00.130
Since I was 14 years old.

35:00.132 --> 35:01.665
Oh, dear god.

35:01.800 --> 35:03.800
I was sent to canada

35:03.869 --> 35:06.736
To infiltrate your
intelligence operations.

35:07.973 --> 35:11.408
Great britain's security
was deemed too sophisticated.

35:11.543 --> 35:12.476
But canada?

35:12.611 --> 35:15.812
Canada shares in
british intelligence.

35:15.814 --> 35:19.616
And canada is weak.

35:22.354 --> 35:24.287
I compromised
the entire british empire

35:24.356 --> 35:27.357
Because I was blinded
by love.

35:33.632 --> 35:34.764
It is true.

35:35.734 --> 35:39.369
I was sent here to exploit you.

35:40.305 --> 35:41.371
But...

35:42.341 --> 35:44.840
But, in time,
I came to love you.

35:46.078 --> 35:50.446
You have been lying
to me every day for 18 years.

35:50.482 --> 35:51.982
(laura): And you to me!

35:51.984 --> 35:54.450
- It's not the same!
- How is it not the same?

35:57.322 --> 35:58.722
I love you.

36:01.193 --> 36:02.725
I love you!

36:04.663 --> 36:06.062
Why should I believe you?

36:07.132 --> 36:08.331
Why?

36:12.471 --> 36:13.736
You shouldn't.

36:21.079 --> 36:23.346
And you're sure you've got
the right one this time?

36:24.583 --> 36:26.416
To be honest, sir, something
isn't sitting right.

36:26.418 --> 36:28.585
So it was mrs. Billingsley
after all?

36:28.720 --> 36:30.487
No! No, no, no.

36:30.489 --> 36:33.356
It was meyers' wife
who breached his lair.

36:33.425 --> 36:36.492
But something about
her account doesn't add up.

36:37.729 --> 36:41.364
She led waxworthy in,
threw her knife in his back,

36:41.366 --> 36:44.067
Then dragged him out
to the middle of the living room

36:44.069 --> 36:47.170
To be found. But if that truly
was her intent,

36:47.305 --> 36:51.641
Why not save the time and effort
and simply kill him out here?

36:51.710 --> 36:53.043
She threw the knife?

36:53.045 --> 36:54.511
That's impossible.

36:54.513 --> 36:56.579
The knife was buried
far too deeply into his back

36:56.648 --> 36:57.847
To have been thrown.

36:57.916 --> 36:58.915
You're quite sure?

36:58.917 --> 37:00.383
Positive.

37:00.385 --> 37:01.550
She's lying.

37:05.924 --> 37:08.458
<i> (murdoch): She led him to</i>
<i> the bookcase.</i>

37:09.394 --> 37:11.227
<i> Made sure he went inside.</i>

37:17.536 --> 37:20.202
Someone else was waiting for
him inside the lair.

37:20.239 --> 37:21.638
A second spy?

37:21.773 --> 37:25.274
She's lying to protect
the identity of her accomplice.

37:25.944 --> 37:27.243
But who?

37:29.281 --> 37:30.280
Mr. Billingsley!

37:30.282 --> 37:31.815
(groaning)

37:33.218 --> 37:34.250
(dramatic music)

37:38.890 --> 37:40.623
I always keep a weapon
close at hand.

37:40.692 --> 37:42.359
You've killed him!

37:51.903 --> 37:53.602
Check his pocket.

37:58.744 --> 38:00.109
It's a gun.

38:01.146 --> 38:03.113
So, billingsley
was her accomplice.

38:03.248 --> 38:05.448
She didn't make a single mistake
in 18 years.

38:05.450 --> 38:08.585
What are the chances
she would have exposed
herself to waxworthy?

38:09.855 --> 38:11.988
He didn't catch you going into
that privet, did he?

38:12.123 --> 38:13.490
No.

38:13.625 --> 38:15.024
Of course not.

38:16.327 --> 38:18.260
I was the one that was going to
find that clock stopped.

38:18.297 --> 38:19.462
I was the target.

38:19.597 --> 38:21.797
But she sent waxworthy in?
Why?

38:22.534 --> 38:24.000
To spare my life.

38:25.070 --> 38:26.803
Billingsley was the one
lying in wait.

38:28.407 --> 38:30.206
And she knew he'd be
ready to kill whoever came
through that bookcase,

38:30.208 --> 38:31.607
Assuming it would be me.

38:31.643 --> 38:33.542
And how did you figure
that out?

38:33.578 --> 38:36.278
Any spy under deep cover for
that long would have a handler,

38:36.315 --> 38:39.149
Likely someone close to her.
Plus,

38:39.284 --> 38:43.085
The billingsleys invited us to
christmas dinner in 1904;

38:43.121 --> 38:44.954
Served soup.

38:45.624 --> 38:46.956
Austrians.

38:48.159 --> 38:49.158
(brackenreid): So, he was about
to shoot you?

38:49.227 --> 38:50.627
No.

38:50.762 --> 38:52.161
He was about to shoot her.

38:52.864 --> 38:54.230
She had been compromised

38:55.667 --> 38:58.034
And he couldn't let
the canadians find out
what she knew.

38:58.036 --> 39:00.970
You saved her life,
just as she saved yours.

39:09.081 --> 39:10.914
I love you, lyle anderson.

39:11.049 --> 39:12.882
The name's meyers.

39:14.052 --> 39:15.452
Terence meyers.

39:24.796 --> 39:26.863
(gentle music)

39:27.899 --> 39:30.366
If you cooperate,
they'll spare your life.

39:31.570 --> 39:32.802
Perhaps.

39:34.906 --> 39:36.472
Become a double agent.

39:37.442 --> 39:38.942
Work with me instead of
against me.

39:41.579 --> 39:43.145
Would you do the same?

39:44.082 --> 39:45.482
Betray the country that
you love?

39:49.388 --> 39:50.519
Precisely.

39:52.624 --> 39:53.956
Goodbye, my love.

39:55.494 --> 39:57.927
Goodbye, terence meyers.

40:00.699 --> 40:02.131
<i> Auf wiedersehen.</i>

40:17.883 --> 40:21.116
Sir, I have a confession
to make.

40:21.153 --> 40:23.586
I helped myself to a loan.

40:24.356 --> 40:25.921
Eh?

40:25.957 --> 40:27.056
From your kitty.

40:27.125 --> 40:28.724
You've stolen
from the petty cash?

40:28.794 --> 40:30.392
Well, sir, just temporarily.

40:30.429 --> 40:33.128
I've decided to coach
a youth basketball team:

40:33.165 --> 40:35.431
The carlton street
stallions.

40:35.434 --> 40:37.733
Ah, but I promise
I'll have them raise the funds

40:37.769 --> 40:38.935
And pay it all back.

40:39.004 --> 40:40.336
What's the money for?

40:40.338 --> 40:41.404
Uniforms.

40:41.473 --> 40:43.206
I'll tell you what,
crabtree.

40:43.275 --> 40:45.742
You can keep the money
on one condition,

40:45.744 --> 40:47.076
That they change their name.

40:47.145 --> 40:48.677
Sir?

40:48.713 --> 40:50.880
Station four stallions.

40:51.015 --> 40:52.181
Oh, I like the ring of that.

40:52.184 --> 40:55.285
Managed by coach crabtree.

40:55.287 --> 40:56.419
Oh, I love the ring of that.

40:56.554 --> 40:58.854
Make sure I get an invite
to the first game.

40:58.890 --> 40:59.922
Sir, will do.

41:02.494 --> 41:04.093
Thank you, my good fellow.

41:07.499 --> 41:09.632
Seems we can't manage to avoid
one another.

41:09.701 --> 41:11.100
It does seem that way,
detective.

41:11.169 --> 41:13.369
Perhaps it is a sign
from above.

41:13.505 --> 41:15.838
Um, can't say I'm a believer
in such things.

41:15.874 --> 41:18.241
No, nor am I.
Then again,

41:18.310 --> 41:21.176
I have nothing to do for
the remainder of the afternoon.

41:22.714 --> 41:25.581
Oh! Would you care
for a pretzel, mr. Strange?

41:25.650 --> 41:27.450
Yes, I think I would.

41:27.585 --> 41:28.851
(watts): One.

41:34.392 --> 41:36.091
Will you see your wife again?

41:37.028 --> 41:37.994
Doubtful.

41:40.131 --> 41:42.665
Although our man,
mccutcheon,

41:42.667 --> 41:44.500
Was captured in salzburg.

41:45.737 --> 41:47.804
If he survives the torture,
there could be a trade.

41:48.873 --> 41:50.073
That would be nice.

41:52.010 --> 41:53.475
Thank you, murdoch.

41:53.512 --> 41:55.712
You're welcome, mr. Meyers.

41:55.847 --> 41:57.480
The name's anderson.

41:59.518 --> 42:00.617
Mm.

42:00.752 --> 42:02.818
Dad?
What happened?

42:02.854 --> 42:05.988
Children, I'm afraid I have
some very bad news to give you.

42:07.425 --> 42:09.692
Your mother has run off with
mr. Billingsley.

42:10.996 --> 42:12.094
What?

42:12.130 --> 42:13.229
What?

42:13.231 --> 42:14.363
Yeah.

42:14.399 --> 42:16.566
It was the two of them that
killed mr. Waxworthy

42:16.701 --> 42:18.701
In order to try to keep their
clandestine love affair

42:18.770 --> 42:20.303
From getting out and--

42:23.108 --> 42:25.975
Our men are pursuing
them now.

42:26.011 --> 42:27.242
Mm.

42:27.279 --> 42:29.546
I fear they may be headed
for the border.

42:31.683 --> 42:35.718
Which case, we'll likely never
see either of them again.

42:35.720 --> 42:37.686
We'll never see mom again?

42:38.323 --> 42:39.589
No, son.

42:39.591 --> 42:40.723
I'm sorry.

42:42.260 --> 42:43.726
So, we're stuck with you?!

42:48.833 --> 42:52.268
Dad, bud and I have
an announcement.

42:53.471 --> 42:55.104
We're getting married!

42:56.541 --> 42:58.107
Father.

43:02.146 --> 43:03.045
Hm.

43:04.883 --> 43:05.948
Sorry.

43:09.821 --> 43:12.755
So, when is your new book
coming out?

43:13.692 --> 43:15.625
Beg your pardon?

43:15.694 --> 43:17.560
<i> 50 reasons to</i>
<i> kill your husband,</i>

43:17.695 --> 43:19.095
By dr. Julia ogden.

43:19.230 --> 43:20.496
Oh, hush.

43:20.498 --> 43:23.099
Oh, you clearly have been giving
it a great deal of thought.

43:24.169 --> 43:26.302
Even if you were a dastardly
russian spy,

43:26.437 --> 43:28.637
I wouldn't kill you,
william.

43:29.841 --> 43:31.507
Although you could stand
to be more complimentary

43:31.543 --> 43:32.741
Of my cooking.

43:33.578 --> 43:35.177
Talk about motive for murder.

43:35.213 --> 43:36.646
(chuckles)

44:07.712 --> 44:08.977
Subtitling: Difuze
