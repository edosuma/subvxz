[gears grinding]

00:08.695 --> 00:11.000
â™ª

00:12.608 --> 00:14.304
[gears grinding]Ooh.

00:14.347 --> 00:16.347
Hey, JB, guess what.You know
this is a manual

00:16.391 --> 00:18.043
and not an automatic, right?

00:18.086 --> 00:19.739
Give me a break, will you?[chuckling]

00:19.782 --> 00:21.521
It's almost dawn.
I'm tired.

00:21.565 --> 00:23.000
And I don't do
a lot of driving

00:23.043 --> 00:24.521
when I'm protecting
your freedom.

00:24.565 --> 00:27.391
Which includes the freedom
to mock your bad driving skills.

00:27.434 --> 00:30.347
With friends like you guys...Aw, you know we love you.

00:30.391 --> 00:33.043
Yeah, we just like to show it
through soul-crushing ridicule.

00:33.086 --> 00:34.043
WOMAN:
Yeah!

00:34.086 --> 00:36.043
Yeah, thank you, man.[groans]

00:36.086 --> 00:37.521
I am wiped out.

00:37.565 --> 00:39.260
JB, when's your leave over?

00:39.304 --> 00:41.260
Uh, next deployment
starts in a few days.

00:41.304 --> 00:43.956
It's been fun
being home, though.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.347
I feel like I
just got back.

00:45.391 --> 00:47.782
[tires screeching][all screaming]

[banging, crashing,

[woman grunting with effort]

00:57.565 --> 00:59.521
[grunts]

01:04.086 --> 01:07.043
WOMAN [distorted]:
...stop the bleeding... just
need to stay calm, all right?

01:07.086 --> 01:08.130
Gonna be all right.

01:10.391 --> 01:14.043
WOMAN:
Gonna be fine. Stay with me.

01:14.782 --> 01:18.130
[groaning]

01:18.173 --> 01:21.956
[gasping weakly]

01:28.217 --> 01:30.260
Sh-She can't breathe.Okay, we're
gonna get you

01:30.304 --> 01:31.478
breathing again, all right?

01:31.521 --> 01:33.826
MAN: Help her!You need to stay very still.

01:33.869 --> 01:35.260
Help her!

01:35.304 --> 01:38.086
[gasping]

01:38.130 --> 01:40.260
This is gonna make it
easier for you, okay?

01:40.304 --> 01:41.565
Now breathe.

01:41.608 --> 01:44.304
[siren approaching]Breathe, breathe...

02:15.043 --> 02:17.043
[elevator bell dings]

02:17.086 --> 02:18.478
Oh!

02:18.521 --> 02:21.043
Thank you for bringing him
home, Officer. I promise

02:21.086 --> 02:22.478
this will never
happen again. McGee--

02:22.521 --> 02:24.043
what did I tell you
about throwing pennies

02:24.086 --> 02:26.043
off the top
of the Washington Monument?

02:26.086 --> 02:28.000
Oh, Tony, if only you were there
to catch them.

02:28.043 --> 02:29.608
I would catch them like this.

02:29.652 --> 02:31.173
Hi, Tony.

02:31.217 --> 02:32.347
Hi, Sergeant Burt.

02:32.391 --> 02:33.956
So, what are you doing here
so early?

02:34.000 --> 02:36.130
Picking up or
dropping off?

02:36.173 --> 02:37.478
Abby and I had breakfast.

02:37.521 --> 02:39.000
After...

02:39.043 --> 02:41.608
I picked her up
from her place.BISHOP: Mmm.

02:41.652 --> 02:43.347
Breakfast. What'd you have?

02:44.043 --> 02:45.000
Sorry, I'm starving.

02:45.043 --> 02:46.521
Thought I'd live vicariously.

02:46.565 --> 02:47.434
You're hungry, Bishop?

02:47.478 --> 02:49.000
She's always
hungry.

02:49.043 --> 02:50.739
I mean, don't let
the probie's tiny,

02:50.782 --> 02:52.043
unassuming
frame fool you.

02:52.086 --> 02:52.956
[chuckling]:
No.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.695
She'll swallow you whole.

02:54.739 --> 02:55.913
I'm not afraid.

02:55.956 --> 02:58.043
I'm not a cannibal, Tony.

02:58.086 --> 02:59.304
Maybe that's why
we never see Jake.

02:59.347 --> 03:00.565
Maybe she ate him.

03:00.608 --> 03:02.086
Or maybe he's just busy.

03:02.130 --> 03:04.695
Or maybe you had him with
fava beans and a nice Chianti.

03:06.391 --> 03:08.652
So, Burt, how are things going
between you and Abby?

03:08.695 --> 03:10.565
Never met anyone like her,
Agent McGee.

03:10.608 --> 03:12.652
It's been great.
She's great.

03:12.695 --> 03:14.043
Beyond great.

03:14.086 --> 03:16.652
Everything has just been...

03:16.695 --> 03:18.043
Great.
Great?

03:18.086 --> 03:19.695
Exactly.

03:19.739 --> 03:22.043
We just click.

03:22.086 --> 03:24.260
You know?Yeah. Yeah, I know.

03:24.304 --> 03:26.739
BISHOP: So, how long has
it been since everything

03:26.782 --> 03:28.478
started being... great?

03:28.521 --> 03:30.130
A couple of months.

03:30.173 --> 03:31.478
Give or take, I guess.

03:31.521 --> 03:35.869
Oh, boy, I'm gonna be late
to my security briefing.

03:35.913 --> 03:37.304
Gotta go. I'll see
you guys later.

03:37.347 --> 03:40.913
All right. Catch you on the
flip side, Mr. Two-months.

03:40.956 --> 03:42.086
[elevator bell dings]

03:42.130 --> 03:43.956
Poor bastard.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.913
Yeah, I really liked him.
Tall, quiet.

03:45.956 --> 03:49.086
Had a sort of Marlboro Man
quality to him.

03:49.130 --> 03:51.000
Why are you two
talking about Burt

03:51.043 --> 03:52.826
like you're never going
to see him again?

03:52.869 --> 03:54.043
Hey, where's Burt going?

03:54.086 --> 03:56.347
Two months.
Copy that.

03:56.391 --> 03:58.304
Grab your gear.

03:58.347 --> 04:00.304
Petty officer killed
in a possible hit-and-run.

04:00.347 --> 04:01.391
Um, hello?

04:04.521 --> 04:06.869
[to herself]:
Did I miss something?

04:07.913 --> 04:09.000
[camera shutter clicking]

04:10.478 --> 04:11.652
GIBBS:
What do you got, Duck?

04:11.695 --> 04:13.478
DUCKY:
Besides the crisp autumnal air,

04:13.521 --> 04:15.043
the scent of dried oak leaves

04:15.086 --> 04:17.434
and the knock-knock
of Old Man Winter

04:17.478 --> 04:20.000
on Mother Nature's front door?

04:20.043 --> 04:21.434
Yeah. Besides that.

04:21.478 --> 04:23.086
Tragedy, I'm afraid.

04:23.130 --> 04:26.739
Though, in this instance, I'm
glad the culprit is a slick road

04:26.782 --> 04:29.391
and not a foolish
texting fatality.

04:29.434 --> 04:30.956
I thought they said hit-and-run?

04:31.000 --> 04:32.217
Well, local LEOs
have one witness

04:32.260 --> 04:34.043
who might have seen
an SUV speeding away,

04:34.086 --> 04:35.869
but it sounds sketchy.

04:35.913 --> 04:38.217
Victim?Petty Officer

04:38.260 --> 04:40.043
John Blaney Hicks.
He was a local.

04:40.086 --> 04:42.000
Home on leave
from the USS Winthrop.

04:42.043 --> 04:44.608
McGEE:
Had two friends with him,
both civilian.

04:44.652 --> 04:47.000
They were rushed to the hospital
in critical condition.

04:47.043 --> 04:48.956
TONY:
Looks like he lost control
of the vehicle,

04:49.000 --> 04:50.347
took out a fence up there

04:50.391 --> 04:51.956
and did a triple gainer
down the hill.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.434
Skid marks?One set,

04:53.478 --> 04:54.565
leading off the road.

04:54.608 --> 04:56.826
Fence post went through
the windshield.

04:56.869 --> 04:59.826
Yeah, and the wound on
the petty officer's neck

04:59.869 --> 05:02.304
suggests that it caused him
to bleed out.

05:02.347 --> 05:03.869
Where'd all these bandages
come from?

05:03.913 --> 05:06.652
JIMMY:
I think I can answer that.

05:06.695 --> 05:08.565
I found what appears
to be cornstarch powder

05:08.608 --> 05:10.173
on the victim's wounds.

05:10.217 --> 05:12.869
Cornstarch-- there's
so many uses for cornstarch.

05:12.913 --> 05:15.260
I remember my cousin Beatrice
used to make the best

05:15.304 --> 05:17.043
orange and cranberry muffins,

05:17.086 --> 05:18.260
she'd have me add
just a pinch,

05:18.304 --> 05:20.347
and it... [stammers]

05:20.391 --> 05:23.043
Um, the medical gloves--

05:23.086 --> 05:26.173
the EMTs probably
tried to save him.

05:26.217 --> 05:28.086
But it took EMTs
20 minutes to get here.

05:28.130 --> 05:29.913
Why would they
bandage a dead man?

05:29.956 --> 05:31.260
MAN:
They wouldn't.

05:32.608 --> 05:35.478
Sergeant Sherman Harper,
Fairfax County PD.

05:35.521 --> 05:37.478
Special Agent Gibbs.

05:37.521 --> 05:39.043
Thanks for making the trek.

05:39.086 --> 05:41.608
Fire department EMTs didn't do
a thing to your petty officer.

05:41.652 --> 05:43.956
They responded to a 911
call, when they got here,

05:44.000 --> 05:45.478
he was bandaged up already.

05:45.521 --> 05:46.869
Same with his friends.

05:46.913 --> 05:47.956
Who tried to save them?

05:48.000 --> 05:49.869
She did.

05:49.913 --> 05:52.434
First responders say
she was holding a trach tube

05:52.478 --> 05:54.000
in the girl's throat
when they pulled up.

05:56.826 --> 05:57.956
Who exactly is she?

05:59.347 --> 06:03.913
Driver's license says
she's Anna Dillon.

06:03.956 --> 06:06.086
Says she saw an SUV
bolt past her a mile back.

06:06.130 --> 06:08.478
Got a little closer
and found the wreckage.

06:08.521 --> 06:10.913
Insists she isn't saying
anything else without a lawyer.

06:10.956 --> 06:12.347
Gonna bring her back
to the station,

06:12.391 --> 06:13.782
call a public defender.

06:13.826 --> 06:15.478
Why, if she saved their lives?

06:15.521 --> 06:17.304
Practicing medicine
without a license, Agent Gibbs.

06:17.347 --> 06:18.913
She's not a nurse,
a doctor,

06:18.956 --> 06:20.565
nor an EMT.

06:20.608 --> 06:22.173
She could've
killed someone.

06:22.217 --> 06:23.652
Maybe she did.

06:27.043 --> 06:28.391
Got a job to do.

06:28.434 --> 06:29.782
Yeah, so do we.

06:32.521 --> 06:33.913
TONY:
No good deed, huh?

06:33.956 --> 06:35.913
BISHOP:
Yeah, doesn't seem right.

06:35.956 --> 06:37.478
Non faciat malum,

06:37.521 --> 06:40.130
ut inde veniat bonum.

06:40.173 --> 06:41.652
"Do not do evil

06:41.695 --> 06:44.086
in order that good may come."

06:44.130 --> 06:45.913
Corpsman!

07:00.173 --> 07:01.304
Talk to me.

07:03.217 --> 07:04.521
Petty Officer Third Class

07:04.565 --> 07:07.434
John Blaney Hicks
was out late with friends.

07:07.478 --> 07:09.956
Skid marks indicate his car
spun out and fatally crashed.

07:10.000 --> 07:13.130
McGEE: Passengers were Mary
LaFleur and Benjamin Koss.

07:13.173 --> 07:14.391
Buddies from high school.

07:14.434 --> 07:16.913
Mary is training to
be a dental hygienist.

07:16.956 --> 07:19.956
Ben does construction and
attends a local junior college.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.695
All three received
in-field medical attention

07:21.739 --> 07:23.043
from this woman,

07:23.086 --> 07:26.739
former Navy Hospital Corpsman
Anna Dillon.

07:26.782 --> 07:29.130
Dillon thought she saw
an SUV leaving the scene,

07:29.173 --> 07:30.565
but couldn't offer
any details.

07:30.608 --> 07:32.652
Carries her medical kit
in her car like Marcus Welby.

07:32.695 --> 07:34.173
Marcus who?

07:34.217 --> 07:36.347
Navy corpsmen don't
carry a medical license.

07:36.391 --> 07:39.043
Back home, she's no different
than a civilian.

07:39.086 --> 07:41.478
But she's trained.And has field experience.

07:41.521 --> 07:42.652
Yeah, but you can't
legally help.

07:42.695 --> 07:44.173
That's not right.

07:44.217 --> 07:45.869
Yeah, ya think?

07:45.913 --> 07:47.086
That was the hospital.

07:47.130 --> 07:48.956
Ben Koss is awake in ICU.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.521
DiNozzo, take Bishop,

07:51.565 --> 07:53.130
go talk to him.
See what he remembers.

07:53.173 --> 07:55.304
McGee,
call Sergeant Harper.

07:55.347 --> 07:57.260
Tell him we need to talk
to Anna Dillon.

07:57.304 --> 07:59.956
[phone rings]Yeah, Duck, I'm on my way.

08:00.000 --> 08:01.652
What's your educated opinion,
Doctor?

08:01.695 --> 08:03.695
I think it's
abundantly clear

08:03.739 --> 08:05.391
that his left carotid artery

08:05.434 --> 08:07.304
was severed by
a fence post.

08:07.347 --> 08:08.652
Oh, no,
no, not about him.

08:08.695 --> 08:10.000
I meant about Burt.

08:10.043 --> 08:12.000
What do you think of Abby's
park police sergeant?

08:12.043 --> 08:13.956
Your time would be better spent,
Mr. Palmer,

08:14.000 --> 08:16.173
concerning yourself
with your own affairs.

08:16.217 --> 08:18.043
Oh, I'm doing that, too.

08:18.086 --> 08:20.000
You know,
Breena's in nesting mode.

08:20.043 --> 08:21.695
Constant projects
around the house.

08:21.739 --> 08:24.260
[door whooshes open]Move this, paint that,
build a hutch.

08:24.304 --> 08:26.043
I don't know what a hutch is.

08:26.086 --> 08:27.521
Fancy word
for a cabinet.

08:27.565 --> 08:29.304
What do you got, Duck?

08:29.347 --> 08:31.695
I was just telling
our father-to-be here,

08:31.739 --> 08:36.217
that a fence post partially
severed his carotid artery.

08:36.260 --> 08:37.521
Yeah, but with the impact,

08:37.565 --> 08:40.260
I doubt he ever
knew what hit him.

08:40.304 --> 08:42.608
Anna Dillon tried to stop
the bleeding.

08:42.652 --> 08:44.260
Oh, Jethro, when
we opened him up,

08:44.304 --> 08:46.739
his body cavity was
filled with blood.

08:46.782 --> 08:48.739
Apparently our young heroine
was able to stop

08:48.782 --> 08:50.173
the external bleeding,

08:50.217 --> 08:53.869
but internally,
he was far too far gone.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.304
Alcohol level?

08:59.347 --> 09:00.608
Zero-point-zero.

09:00.652 --> 09:01.913
"Sober as a judge."

09:01.956 --> 09:03.304
And his records show

09:03.347 --> 09:06.347
no history of
seizures or drug abuse.

09:06.391 --> 09:09.782
There was no medical reasons
for the vehicle to crash.

09:13.173 --> 09:15.521
I can't believe JB is dead.

09:17.608 --> 09:19.652
Where's Mary?

09:19.695 --> 09:22.260
She's being prepped
for surgery.

09:22.304 --> 09:25.000
This is a nightmare.

09:25.043 --> 09:26.826
TONY: So, Ben,
help us piece this together.

09:26.869 --> 09:28.260
What happened?

09:28.304 --> 09:30.304
A deer run across the road?
JB panic?

09:30.347 --> 09:32.043
No, sir.

09:32.086 --> 09:35.347
JB was rock solid.

09:35.391 --> 09:37.217
The doctor said your memory
might be a little fuzzy.

09:37.260 --> 09:40.652
My memory's just fine.

09:40.695 --> 09:43.347
JB didn't lose control
of the vehicle.

09:43.391 --> 09:45.173
We were hit by another car.

09:45.217 --> 09:47.217
Someone ran us
off the road.

09:47.260 --> 09:49.217
Anna Dillon
was telling the truth.

09:49.260 --> 09:50.695
Did you see the other car?

09:50.739 --> 09:52.304
BISHOP: Or get a look
at the driver?

09:52.347 --> 09:54.347
TONY: Is it possible
that it was an SUV?

09:56.565 --> 09:59.391
I remember...

09:59.434 --> 10:02.695
feeling something clip
the back bumper,

10:02.739 --> 10:07.086
and seeing the-the rear
of a car as we spun.

10:07.130 --> 10:09.565
But after that...

10:09.608 --> 10:11.869
I'm sorry,
I wish I could be more help.

10:11.913 --> 10:14.000
No, you've done plenty.

10:16.913 --> 10:19.130
The doctors said if it wasn't
for some woman

10:19.173 --> 10:22.391
who came to the crash...

10:22.434 --> 10:24.826
I wouldn't be here.

10:24.869 --> 10:26.043
That's true.

10:26.086 --> 10:27.695
She's a former Navy corpsman.

10:27.739 --> 10:29.217
You know where
I can reach her?

10:29.260 --> 10:31.826
I want to say thank you.

10:31.869 --> 10:33.347
Fairfax County Jail.

10:37.086 --> 10:40.043
GIBBS: What else do we have
on Anna Dillon?

10:40.086 --> 10:42.173
McGEE: Well, she served
two Fleet Marine Force
Corpsman tours

10:42.217 --> 10:43.826
in Afghanistan,

10:43.869 --> 10:47.130
awarded a Bronze Star for
acts of heroism under fire,

10:47.173 --> 10:48.608
saved 12 lives,

10:48.652 --> 10:51.260
and performed over 30 additional
in-country procedures.

10:51.304 --> 10:54.043
Currently works in the DC
school system as a janitor,

10:54.086 --> 10:55.826
which is kind of like
a war zone.

10:55.869 --> 10:57.608
What about the night
of the crash?

10:57.652 --> 10:59.869
Uh, she'd just
finished her shift.

10:59.913 --> 11:01.826
She arrived at the site
moments after the collision.

11:01.869 --> 11:04.173
That's when she saw an SUV
speeding away.

11:04.217 --> 11:06.043
Why isn't she in here, McGee?

11:06.086 --> 11:07.478
Well, I called Sergeant Harper.

11:07.521 --> 11:09.826
She's still being questioned
by Fairfax County P.D.

11:09.869 --> 11:11.652
Go, get him on the phone.

11:11.695 --> 11:13.086
You know, boss,

11:13.130 --> 11:14.652
according to Anna Dillon's
records,

11:14.695 --> 11:17.043
she called 911 and used OnStar
the second she got there.

11:18.217 --> 11:20.478
GIBBS: Anna Dillon knew

11:20.521 --> 11:23.260
that she was going to be in
trouble and she did it anyway.

11:25.304 --> 11:26.913
McGee.

11:26.956 --> 11:30.043
Anna's being officially charged.

11:30.086 --> 11:32.913
County prosecutor's
already on the way.

11:46.652 --> 11:49.043
GUARD:
When you want out,
just let me know.

11:52.043 --> 11:53.869
Ready to talk,
Petty Officer?

11:53.913 --> 11:55.652
I'm still waiting
for a lawyer.

11:55.695 --> 11:59.043
Public defender?

11:59.086 --> 12:03.086
Yeah, don't hold your breath.

12:03.130 --> 12:04.304
Well, you're NCIS.

12:04.347 --> 12:05.565
They'd tell me not to talk
to you, either.

12:05.608 --> 12:08.086
Yeah, maybe.

12:08.130 --> 12:09.565
So?

12:10.608 --> 12:13.869
So... they won't understand.

12:13.913 --> 12:15.217
They don't know who you are,

12:15.260 --> 12:17.260
they don't know
what you've done.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.391
We want to help.

12:20.434 --> 12:22.173
Well, I'm glad to hear that,
but it's too late, sir.

12:22.217 --> 12:24.434
I called 911.

12:24.478 --> 12:26.521
I tried to help those kids
and one's dead.

12:26.565 --> 12:28.217
Yeah, but two are alive
because of you.

12:28.260 --> 12:29.478
There should be three.

12:29.521 --> 12:30.695
I hesitated.

12:30.739 --> 12:32.173
Can't blame yourself.

12:32.217 --> 12:33.826
He was alive when I got there.

12:33.869 --> 12:35.608
He was dead when I left.

12:35.652 --> 12:37.826
I know I could have done more.

12:42.826 --> 12:43.782
Uh...

12:48.304 --> 12:50.260
Sit down.

12:57.608 --> 12:59.652
[sighs]

13:01.391 --> 13:03.739
Why not run, Dillon?

13:03.782 --> 13:05.130
Why take the fall?

13:05.173 --> 13:06.434
I thought about it.

13:06.478 --> 13:09.043
Yeah... but you stayed.

13:09.086 --> 13:10.434
I had to.

13:10.478 --> 13:12.478
I'm trained to.

13:12.521 --> 13:15.130
I gotta say, this is not
exactly the vision

13:15.173 --> 13:16.521
I had for my future.

13:16.565 --> 13:18.956
Only damn difference
between me and those EMTs

13:19.000 --> 13:21.086
is the car we drove up in.Yeah.

13:21.130 --> 13:23.000
And the law.

13:23.043 --> 13:25.043
I have the training,
you know that.

13:25.086 --> 13:26.478
Ever since I got out,

13:26.521 --> 13:29.043
I can't get a single
job in the field.

13:29.086 --> 13:32.043
I've been saving to go
to medical school.

13:32.086 --> 13:33.956
But even if I'm cleared,

13:34.000 --> 13:36.521
you think anyone will accept me
with this on my record?

13:39.260 --> 13:42.043
I learned the same as the Army
and the Air Force medics,

13:42.086 --> 13:44.347
and for some reason,
they come out EMT-Basic,

13:44.391 --> 13:47.608
and-and they could have
legally saved those kids.

13:50.695 --> 13:52.086
Why can't I?

13:56.434 --> 13:58.739
Special Agent Gibbs,
what do you think you're doing?

13:58.782 --> 14:00.391
She hasn't been charged
with a crime yet.

14:00.434 --> 14:03.043
She's being detained
for the prosecutor,

14:03.086 --> 14:04.695
who's on his way.
No.

14:04.739 --> 14:05.782
Not anymore.

14:05.826 --> 14:07.608
You make a call?
No, not me.

14:07.652 --> 14:10.043
U.S. Attorney for
the Eastern District.

14:10.086 --> 14:12.521
I know she's former Navy.

14:12.565 --> 14:13.956
JB was Navy, too.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.173
I respect the uniform
more than you know.

14:16.217 --> 14:18.608
But she shouldn't
have touched them.

14:18.652 --> 14:19.913
She should have waited
for help.

14:19.956 --> 14:21.260
Waited?

14:21.304 --> 14:23.000
Waited and watched them die?

14:23.043 --> 14:24.347
Miss, I'm not saying it's right.

14:24.391 --> 14:25.739
But you broke the law.

14:25.782 --> 14:27.434
Why are you doing this?

14:27.478 --> 14:29.391
Why aren't you looking for the
person who caused this crash?

14:29.434 --> 14:32.260
It was an accident.No, it wasn't.

14:33.521 --> 14:35.521
Sergeant, look...

14:35.565 --> 14:37.304
we all want
to solve this case,

14:37.347 --> 14:39.173
but we need
her help to do it.

14:39.217 --> 14:40.434
You want
to question her?

14:40.478 --> 14:41.695
You do it here.

14:41.739 --> 14:43.217
Use my office,
whatever you need.

14:43.260 --> 14:45.000
This isn't about questioning.

14:45.043 --> 14:47.478
This is about doing
what's right.

14:47.521 --> 14:50.130
Mary LaFleur,
a passenger in that car,

14:50.173 --> 14:52.043
just got out of surgery.

14:52.086 --> 14:54.043
She may be paralyzed.

14:54.086 --> 14:56.086
Your corpsman moved her
after the crash.

14:56.130 --> 14:58.086
I did everything right.

14:58.130 --> 14:59.521
Talk to the EMTs.

14:59.565 --> 15:01.043
You can't blame me for that.

15:01.086 --> 15:02.478
I know Mary's parents.

15:02.521 --> 15:04.608
I have to answer
for what was done to her.

15:06.086 --> 15:07.260
You looking for answers

15:07.304 --> 15:10.043
or you looking for
someone to pin it on?

15:10.086 --> 15:11.521
You're a smart man,
Agent Gibbs.

15:11.565 --> 15:12.869
I won't argue with you.

15:12.913 --> 15:14.956
But you know where
this is headed.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.173
You can't change the law.

15:17.217 --> 15:19.913
No, we can't.

15:19.956 --> 15:23.739
But we can fight like hell
and we can try.

15:40.652 --> 15:42.782
I didn't know you come here,
Gibbs.

15:42.826 --> 15:44.956
Pretty good cup
of coffee though, huh?

15:45.000 --> 15:46.434
Our little secret, right?

15:46.478 --> 15:48.347
Right.

15:48.391 --> 15:49.826
See you, Norvell.

15:51.434 --> 15:52.652
[door bells jingle]

15:55.478 --> 15:58.043
Why do you insist
on meeting me here?

15:58.086 --> 16:00.043
And don't tell me
it's the food.

16:00.086 --> 16:02.608
Good people.

16:02.652 --> 16:04.826
Honest people.

16:04.869 --> 16:06.347
Hungry people.

16:06.391 --> 16:07.956
The club sandwich
isn't half bad.

16:09.652 --> 16:11.652
I'm sorry about your dad.

16:13.652 --> 16:16.434
He would've loved
to have met you.

16:16.478 --> 16:19.521
Rumor has it he was
as challenging as his son.

16:19.565 --> 16:20.956
[both chuckle]

16:21.000 --> 16:24.130
Yeah, well, there's an
understatement.

16:24.173 --> 16:26.434
I like a good challenge.

16:31.608 --> 16:34.695
Former Navy corpsman
tried to save lives.

16:34.739 --> 16:37.130
Now she's facing
legal charges.

16:37.173 --> 16:39.086
Flaw in the system.

16:39.130 --> 16:40.782
System needs to be fixed.

16:40.826 --> 16:42.217
Well, a lot of folks
would agree,

16:42.260 --> 16:44.217
but what can I do to help?

16:44.260 --> 16:47.043
She needs a lawyer.

16:47.086 --> 16:48.478
Carrie, she need a good lawyer.

16:48.521 --> 16:49.478
She needs you.

16:49.521 --> 16:51.521
[wry laugh]
We won't win.

16:51.565 --> 16:53.043
I know that, but you
can lessen the charges,

16:53.086 --> 16:56.434
and we take
the fight to them.

16:56.478 --> 16:58.043
And then what?

16:58.086 --> 17:00.869
Then you tell me
the right people to talk to.

17:00.913 --> 17:02.434
[sighs]

17:02.478 --> 17:04.347
But right now...

17:04.391 --> 17:05.869
we're all she's got.

17:08.434 --> 17:10.739
After what she did
for her country,

17:10.782 --> 17:13.347
she deserves some support.

17:13.391 --> 17:15.391
[sighs]

17:16.565 --> 17:19.217
Well, you will owe me.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.173
Well, I've been there before.

17:24.217 --> 17:26.608
[laughs]
Fries have gotten better.

17:28.565 --> 17:30.565
[laughs]

17:32.434 --> 17:34.086
[explosion, automatic gunfire]

17:34.130 --> 17:36.086
Corpsman up!

17:36.130 --> 17:37.695
Hold this down, Marine!

17:37.739 --> 17:39.826
[indistinct shouting nearby]

17:39.869 --> 17:41.869
All right, hold this, too.

17:41.913 --> 17:43.695
Give me your weight.[groans]

17:43.739 --> 17:45.478
[gunfire]Corpsman!

17:45.521 --> 17:47.478
[explosions, automatic gunfire]

17:47.521 --> 17:48.782
[men shouting]

17:48.826 --> 17:49.826
You're going to be fine.

17:49.869 --> 17:51.869
[men shouting,
automatic gunfire]

17:54.391 --> 17:55.608
[weakly]:
Save me.

17:55.652 --> 17:57.652
TONY:
Anna...

18:00.086 --> 18:01.260
Anna?

18:01.304 --> 18:03.043
Hmm?

18:03.086 --> 18:05.043
I'm sorry, um...

18:05.086 --> 18:06.434
where were we?

18:06.478 --> 18:09.043
Finished, just need you
to sign your statement.

18:09.086 --> 18:11.695
[door opens]

18:11.739 --> 18:13.434
Hey, boss.

18:13.478 --> 18:14.695
We're all done here.

18:14.739 --> 18:16.652
Wish I could remember
more about the SUV.

18:16.695 --> 18:19.173
I'm not being much
help to anybody, huh?

18:19.217 --> 18:20.695
All right,
we better get moving.

18:20.739 --> 18:22.782
We're gonna fight traffic
all the way back to Fairfax.

18:22.826 --> 18:25.391
She's staying here.

18:26.565 --> 18:29.347
The U.S. Attorney only
granted us temporary...

18:29.391 --> 18:32.826
Okay, she stays here.

18:32.869 --> 18:34.434
"These aren't the droids
we're looking for."

18:36.782 --> 18:38.391
[door closes]

18:38.434 --> 18:40.043
So what now?

18:40.086 --> 18:42.173
[elevator bell dings]

18:42.217 --> 18:45.000
Look, I get it--
you don't like to talk,

18:45.043 --> 18:47.217
but can you give me a hint
as to what we're doing?

18:47.260 --> 18:50.130
Clearing some things up.

18:52.260 --> 18:52.826
[elevator bell dings]

18:52.869 --> 18:55.000
Hello, Jethro.

18:55.043 --> 18:57.478
Oh!

18:57.521 --> 18:59.347
To what do I owe the honor?

18:59.391 --> 19:01.565
Duck, Former Hospital
Corpsman, Anna Dillon.

19:01.608 --> 19:03.043
Ah, a kindred spirit.

19:03.086 --> 19:05.739
Donald Mallard,
former RAMC.

19:05.782 --> 19:07.565
We need to see
the petty officer.

19:07.608 --> 19:08.913
Oh, of course.

19:08.956 --> 19:10.565
Right this way.

19:15.652 --> 19:17.739
Petty Officer Third Class
John Blaney Hicks.

19:17.782 --> 19:20.043
Corpsman Dillon thinks
he should have lived.

19:20.086 --> 19:22.086
DUCKY:
I see.

19:22.130 --> 19:24.826
Young lady, the petty officer
lost more blood

19:24.869 --> 19:27.391
in the first ten seconds
after the crash

19:27.434 --> 19:30.000
than ever could have been
compensated for.

19:30.043 --> 19:31.826
I hesitated.

19:31.869 --> 19:33.913
If I was quicker, I...

19:33.956 --> 19:35.956
The only thing that could've
saved this man's life

19:36.000 --> 19:38.782
is if he never got into the
accident in the first place.

19:38.826 --> 19:41.521
But I...
You didn't
let him die alone.

19:41.565 --> 19:43.782
That's all anyone
could have done.

19:43.826 --> 19:45.956
As my commanding officer
once said,

19:46.000 --> 19:48.826
after a particularly
ferocious battle,

19:48.869 --> 19:50.913
"You didn't fire the shot,

19:50.956 --> 19:54.043
"so you can't blame yourself
for those you lose.

19:54.086 --> 19:56.608
You can't save everyone."

20:03.869 --> 20:05.826
McGEE:
Abbs, we need your help.

20:05.869 --> 20:08.695
Please tell us
you have something.

20:08.739 --> 20:10.086
I have something.

20:10.130 --> 20:12.478
Wait, did you just say that
because I asked you to?

20:12.521 --> 20:15.478
Yes. But also because
I found something.

20:15.521 --> 20:16.608
We'll take it.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.521
Okay, we know from Ben Koss

20:20.565 --> 20:23.608
that Petty Officer Hicks'
vehicle was rear-ended.

20:23.652 --> 20:25.391
There was no paint left behind

20:25.434 --> 20:27.739
and I can't trace a dent.

20:27.782 --> 20:28.695
But...?

20:29.782 --> 20:30.652
Please say there's a but.

20:30.695 --> 20:32.130
There's a but.

20:32.173 --> 20:34.695
Wait, are you just saying that
because I asked you to?

20:34.739 --> 20:35.956
Please, just get
to the point.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.869
The point is there was paint
left behind. See?

20:41.086 --> 20:42.782
All I see is silver.

20:43.608 --> 20:45.086
Well, the original

20:45.130 --> 20:47.826
was Silver 266

20:47.869 --> 20:50.956
and our intruder is Silver 272.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.130
And when the light hits

20:53.173 --> 20:56.130
the additional metallic
fleck, it's clear.

20:57.173 --> 20:59.304
I mean, they're
totally different.

20:59.347 --> 21:01.173
All right, just-just trust me.

21:01.217 --> 21:03.869
And remind me to never consult
any of you on interior design.

21:03.913 --> 21:07.739
We need to match
the model 266 or 272.

21:07.782 --> 21:09.739
Probably go to the DMV--It's an old color.

21:11.043 --> 21:13.173
There's five currently
registered in Fairfax County.

21:13.217 --> 21:14.739
Nice work, Abby.TONY: Sweet!

21:19.086 --> 21:21.130
What?

21:21.173 --> 21:22.782
I know what you're
thinking of doing

21:22.826 --> 21:24.043
and I just want
you to know

21:24.086 --> 21:25.521
that I think it's
premature.

21:25.565 --> 21:29.043
Okay, McGee,
I know that we used to...

21:29.086 --> 21:31.695
and we don't anymore,
and it's been a long time.

21:31.739 --> 21:34.782
But, uh, this is kind of private

21:34.826 --> 21:37.000
and sort of none of
your business, so...

21:37.043 --> 21:38.521
Abby, come on.

21:38.565 --> 21:42.652
If I want to break up
with Burt, that is my decision.

21:43.782 --> 21:45.652
Now, shoo--
I have work to do.

21:47.695 --> 21:49.130
Oh, McGee, please!

21:49.173 --> 21:51.260
Okay. Okay.

21:58.695 --> 22:00.217
Mmm... you smell that?

22:00.260 --> 22:01.739
Motor oil?

22:01.782 --> 22:02.695
Nothing quite like it.

22:02.739 --> 22:03.695
Diesel fuel.

22:03.739 --> 22:04.869
Axel grease.

22:04.913 --> 22:06.782
I love it.

22:06.826 --> 22:07.739
What?

22:07.782 --> 22:09.565
You're weird.

22:09.608 --> 22:11.130
MAN:
Can I help you?

22:11.173 --> 22:12.608
Dave Lancellotti?

22:12.652 --> 22:13.782
Who's asking?

22:13.826 --> 22:15.086
NCIS.

22:15.130 --> 22:16.652
Got a few questions about
your silver truck.

22:16.695 --> 22:17.695
What about it?

22:17.739 --> 22:18.826
There was a hit-and-run
yesterday

22:18.869 --> 22:20.652
and your vehicle matches
the description.

22:20.695 --> 22:21.913
That's crazy.

22:21.956 --> 22:23.521
It's been locked up all week,
around back.

22:23.565 --> 22:25.782
I only use it
to haul Bridget, here.

22:25.826 --> 22:27.782
As you can see, my girl is
in no shape for racing.

22:27.826 --> 22:29.782
We still
need to see the truck.

22:29.826 --> 22:31.521
No problem.

22:33.608 --> 22:34.739
You know anything about racing?

22:34.782 --> 22:35.739
Yeah, I grew up
at the track.

22:35.782 --> 22:36.608
Three older brothers.

22:36.652 --> 22:37.739
Where you been all my life?

22:37.782 --> 22:39.130
She's been fighting crime

22:39.173 --> 22:40.695
and ridding the world
of terror.

22:40.739 --> 22:42.086
Not to mention, she's married.

22:44.173 --> 22:45.434
Where's the truck, Dave?

22:45.478 --> 22:47.217
What the hell...?

22:50.391 --> 22:51.565
I swear it was here.

22:51.608 --> 22:53.565
Where were you last night,
Mr. Lancellotti?

22:53.608 --> 22:55.652
At the Manchester Pub.

22:57.086 --> 22:58.391
Somebody stole my truck.

22:58.434 --> 22:59.782
Yeah, maybe. Or not.

22:59.826 --> 23:00.782
Look, call the pub.

23:00.826 --> 23:01.826
Woody Ross is the bartender.

23:01.869 --> 23:02.913
He'll vouch for me.

23:02.956 --> 23:04.652
Well, for your sake,
I hope he does.

23:14.956 --> 23:16.913
You should eat.

23:16.956 --> 23:19.304
Don't worry about it.

23:19.347 --> 23:21.695
I haven't had a chance
to catch my breath

23:21.739 --> 23:23.260
since this all started.

23:25.391 --> 23:26.782
Thank you.

23:26.826 --> 23:28.478
Thank you,Dillon.

23:28.521 --> 23:31.826
Not enough people have been
saying that lately.

23:31.869 --> 23:33.217
Thank you.

23:35.086 --> 23:36.521
Where you from?

23:38.304 --> 23:40.304
Originally?
Uh, Virginia Beach.

23:40.347 --> 23:41.565
Parents?

23:41.608 --> 23:44.000
My Dad was
a manufacturer's rep--

23:44.043 --> 23:45.565
kind of like a salesman.

23:45.608 --> 23:47.260
Mom was a nurse.

23:47.304 --> 23:48.739
Raised their daughter right.

23:49.347 --> 23:50.869
They'd be proud.

23:50.913 --> 23:53.086
Yeah... yeah, they were.

23:54.565 --> 23:56.782
Sir, I just want
a chance...

23:56.826 --> 23:59.652
you know,
to do what I'm good at.

23:59.695 --> 24:02.043
When I saw that crash...

24:02.086 --> 24:03.434
those kids...

24:03.478 --> 24:05.260
it all just kicked in,

24:05.304 --> 24:06.260
and I knew...

24:06.304 --> 24:08.782
I knew what I needed to do.

24:08.826 --> 24:10.652
What you hadto do, Doc.

24:19.695 --> 24:20.652
Hello.

24:20.695 --> 24:22.130
Anna, this is
Carrie Clark.

24:22.173 --> 24:24.608
A lawyer.

24:24.652 --> 24:26.652
Knows about the Navy.

24:26.695 --> 24:27.913
Knows about you.

24:27.956 --> 24:28.652
CARRIE: Agent Gibbs
told me all about you

24:28.695 --> 24:30.565
and about what happened,

24:30.608 --> 24:34.391
and I'm here to help,
if you'll let me.

24:43.391 --> 24:45.304
Hey! You're here early.

24:45.347 --> 24:46.608
McGEE:
I wanted to catch a worm.

24:46.652 --> 24:47.869
Where you been
all morning?

24:47.913 --> 24:51.086
Well, you know me,
McEarly Bird Special.

24:51.130 --> 24:53.217
I like to work late,
burn the midnight oil.

24:53.260 --> 24:55.478
We ran down Dave
Lancellotti's alibi.

24:55.521 --> 24:57.565
Please tell me
it fell through.

24:57.608 --> 24:59.043
Woody the bartender
vouched for him,

24:59.086 --> 25:00.913
right after he hit on Bishop.

25:00.956 --> 25:02.434
Something isn't right here.

25:02.478 --> 25:03.565
Yeah?

25:03.608 --> 25:04.695
You got an answer?

25:04.739 --> 25:06.521
Take a look, boss.

25:06.565 --> 25:08.391
Dave Lancellotti's
a semi-pro racer.

25:08.434 --> 25:11.304
He has a Web site and
a bit of a following.

25:11.347 --> 25:14.869
Judging by the comments section,
he's a hothead on the track.

25:16.043 --> 25:18.565
There's half a dozen fight
videos here, posted by fans.

25:18.608 --> 25:19.956
GIBBS:
There.

25:23.521 --> 25:24.956
There's Lancellotti.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.434
[clamoring on video]

25:26.478 --> 25:27.434
[men shouting]

25:27.478 --> 25:29.391
Get off of me!
Get off me!

25:29.434 --> 25:30.434
What are you thinking, huh?Freeze it.

25:30.478 --> 25:32.565
You wrecked my car!TONY: That is...

25:32.608 --> 25:33.652
Ben Koss.

25:33.695 --> 25:35.043
One of the survivors
from the crash.

25:35.086 --> 25:36.956
Lancellotti
certainly had motive.

25:45.608 --> 25:47.043
KOSS:
The accident?

25:47.086 --> 25:48.434
I already told you
everything I know.

25:48.478 --> 25:49.913
Different accident.

25:49.956 --> 25:51.260
TONY: We're talking
about the racetrack.

25:51.304 --> 25:52.695
What was the fight about

25:52.739 --> 25:54.478
between you and
Dave Lancellotti?

25:54.521 --> 25:56.347
You think he has
something to do with this?

25:56.391 --> 25:57.739
Don't know.

25:59.434 --> 26:03.260
Dave fights with everyone
after a wreck on the track...

26:03.304 --> 26:07.304
but he's a decent guy otherwise;
loyal to a fault.

26:07.347 --> 26:09.304
Just not the best driver
that day.

26:09.347 --> 26:10.347
How so?

26:10.391 --> 26:11.652
KOSS: Well, the track
was wide open.

26:11.695 --> 26:13.652
I was looking for
a fast groove when,

26:13.695 --> 26:16.478
out of nowhere,
Dave bumps my tail.

26:16.521 --> 26:18.652
We both spun out,
hit the outside rail.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.434
That sounds familiar.

26:23.695 --> 26:26.652
[music blaring]

26:26.695 --> 26:28.043
This is loud!

26:28.086 --> 26:29.652
McGEE:
Really?

26:29.695 --> 26:31.913
You mean you wouldn't find this
relaxing on the drive home?

26:31.956 --> 26:33.652
Hey, can you
turn this down?

26:33.695 --> 26:37.130
[turns up volume]

26:37.173 --> 26:39.173
18-inch tubes, man.

26:39.217 --> 26:40.695
That's high-end stuff.

26:40.739 --> 26:42.304
[turns off music][shouting]: What?

26:42.347 --> 26:43.695
[chuckles]

26:45.304 --> 26:46.521
Can I help you with something,
sweetheart?

26:48.260 --> 26:49.347
NCIS.

26:49.391 --> 26:51.913
We're looking for
David Lancellotti.

26:51.956 --> 26:54.913
Oh... well,
that's too bad.

26:54.956 --> 26:56.869
I was kind of hoping
you'd be looking for me.

26:56.913 --> 26:58.173
I'm sorry.
And you are?

26:58.217 --> 26:59.521
Bennett Jemaine,
at your service.

27:01.000 --> 27:02.695
What's this about, guys?

27:02.739 --> 27:04.260
Lancellotti works here, right?

27:04.304 --> 27:05.913
Part-time. Why?

27:05.956 --> 27:07.130
Any idea where he is?

27:07.173 --> 27:09.478
[groans]
Who knows?

27:09.521 --> 27:11.130
Dave got kind of
antsy-pantsy

27:11.173 --> 27:12.565
when you guys
paid him a visit.

27:14.000 --> 27:14.782
Oh, yeah,
we know about that.

27:14.826 --> 27:16.043
Co-workers talk.

27:16.086 --> 27:18.130
You want to go ahead and define
"antsy-pantsy"?

27:18.173 --> 27:22.000
Upset a lot of people
when you guys said Dave

27:22.043 --> 27:25.695
might have something to do with
the death of that Navy kid.

27:25.739 --> 27:28.652
You wouldn't happen to be the
female agent that got into it

27:28.695 --> 27:31.086
with Woody over
at Manchester's Pub
last night, would you?

27:33.130 --> 27:35.826
Uh, yeah, he wasn't
so happy with me.

27:35.869 --> 27:38.695
There may have been
a few peanut bowls thrown.

27:38.739 --> 27:39.782
Hey, I wouldn't take
that too personally.

27:39.826 --> 27:42.608
Look, we know
Dave's truck is missing.

27:42.652 --> 27:44.043
You really want to
be a good friend,

27:44.086 --> 27:45.173
tell us what you know.

27:46.956 --> 27:50.130
Last time I saw Dave
was a couple hours ago.

27:50.173 --> 27:52.173
Said he had to
clear his head.

27:52.217 --> 27:53.260
That's all I know.

27:57.695 --> 27:59.130
Hey, I got your text.

27:59.173 --> 28:00.217
What's so important
it couldn't wait

28:00.260 --> 28:02.043
until you were out
of the bathroom?

28:02.086 --> 28:03.869
What are you talking about?
I didn't text you.

28:03.913 --> 28:06.086
Yes, you did.
I did.

28:07.304 --> 28:08.521
We need to talk.

28:08.565 --> 28:10.478
You know,
the "men" in "men's room"

28:10.521 --> 28:12.869
is more of a rule than
a suggestion, probie.

28:12.913 --> 28:17.043
Look, you two always
get to go off giggling

28:17.086 --> 28:19.869
to the urinal together
and I always get left out.

28:19.913 --> 28:22.043
So we're gonna talk,
and we're gonna do it here.

28:22.086 --> 28:23.913
Okay.

28:23.956 --> 28:25.260
But make it quick.

28:25.304 --> 28:28.043
Okay...

28:28.086 --> 28:31.043
you two know something
about Abby and Burt.

28:31.086 --> 28:32.782
Talk.

28:35.043 --> 28:36.304
Remember, I was NSA.

28:36.347 --> 28:39.000
I know how to find out
your darkest secrets.

28:41.173 --> 28:42.478
Gibbs has rules,

28:42.521 --> 28:44.086
we all know that,
but Abby...

28:45.913 --> 28:48.173
...has ideas about dating.

28:48.217 --> 28:49.521
Tony, it's a secret.

28:49.565 --> 28:53.000
If it's so secret,
how do you know about them?

28:54.043 --> 28:55.391
That's a very good question.

28:55.434 --> 28:57.913
I'll guard the door.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.304
All right...

29:06.347 --> 29:09.130
well, you should probably know
that Abby and I used to date.

29:09.173 --> 29:11.173
Ew.
Like, each other?

29:11.217 --> 29:12.304
Yeah.

29:12.347 --> 29:14.173
Wait, isn't that
a violation of Rule 12?

29:14.217 --> 29:16.043
Never date a--It was a long time ago.

29:16.086 --> 29:20.000
After we had broken up,
one night, I went to her lab,

29:20.043 --> 29:22.434
found a scribbled
piece of paper-- a list.

29:22.478 --> 29:25.956
Potential boyfriends had to
fulfill certain conditions

29:26.000 --> 29:28.521
by a prearranged date,
or else good-bye.

29:28.565 --> 29:30.695
Such as...

29:30.739 --> 29:32.826
Well, things start off
relatively normal:

29:32.869 --> 29:34.130
Opening the door for her,

29:34.173 --> 29:36.521
flowers,
putting the seat down...

29:36.565 --> 29:39.000
Then, around...
number eight...

29:39.043 --> 29:41.521
it gets, uh...

29:41.565 --> 29:43.086
What?

29:51.652 --> 29:53.043
Does she know
you have these?

29:53.086 --> 29:55.043
Yeah, she wasn't happy
when she found out.

29:55.086 --> 29:57.956
These are all very...

29:58.000 --> 29:59.782
specific.
Yeah.

29:59.826 --> 30:00.956
These ideas apply to you?

30:01.000 --> 30:02.391
No, no.

30:02.434 --> 30:04.913
Those rules weren't
in place when we were together.

30:04.956 --> 30:06.913
At least, I don't think so...

30:06.956 --> 30:09.086
And what's with the
two-month cut-off?

30:09.130 --> 30:11.043
Abby's sabotaging herself.

30:11.086 --> 30:12.043
I've seen stuff
like this before.

30:12.086 --> 30:13.260
We have to talk to her.

30:13.304 --> 30:14.521
No! No, no, no!

30:14.565 --> 30:16.086
No.
You cannot say a word.

30:16.130 --> 30:18.304
If you say anything,
Abby'll know I told you.

30:18.347 --> 30:20.173
Trust us, Bishop.

30:20.217 --> 30:21.434
The Abby dating world
is a vortex

30:21.478 --> 30:22.826
you do not want
to get sucked into.

30:22.869 --> 30:25.043
Sometimes...
it's complicated.

30:25.086 --> 30:26.521
Just let Abby be Abby.

30:29.913 --> 30:32.086
I spent all night looking
through relevant statutes.

30:32.130 --> 30:33.304
And?

30:33.347 --> 30:35.086
And you know
what you did was illegal.

30:35.130 --> 30:37.782
You were caught
holding a tracheotomy tube

30:37.826 --> 30:38.782
in a girl's throat.

30:38.826 --> 30:39.956
GIBBS:
And she saved two lives.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.782
She did what the Navy
trained her to do.

30:41.826 --> 30:43.130
That's got to count
for something.

30:43.173 --> 30:45.739
If she was in the Army
or in the Air Force, yes.

30:45.782 --> 30:47.782
She would be
EMT-Basic certified.

30:47.826 --> 30:50.130
But Navy training doesn't
fall under state licensure.

30:50.173 --> 30:52.260
So I'm going to jail
for a technicality?

30:52.304 --> 30:53.521
Not if I can help it.

30:55.130 --> 30:56.913
I think that our best move
is to admit what you did.

30:56.956 --> 30:58.043
Go after the law itself?

30:58.086 --> 30:59.782
Exactly.
This wasn't intended

30:59.826 --> 31:00.913
to prosecute
people like you.

31:00.956 --> 31:02.043
We present our case,

31:02.086 --> 31:03.391
tell them about your training--

31:03.434 --> 31:04.782
that you saw three kids dying

31:04.826 --> 31:06.043
that you knew
that you could help.

31:06.086 --> 31:08.304
Throw in your testimony
about the hit-and-run.

31:08.347 --> 31:10.913
If we can get the Navy and the
victims' families on your side,

31:10.956 --> 31:13.043
we stand a chance.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.043
Okay, I'll set it up.

31:15.086 --> 31:16.130
SERGEANT HARPER:
Set what up?

31:16.173 --> 31:18.043
Boss, I'm-I'm sorry.

31:18.086 --> 31:19.782
He was waiting for you
in the squad room.

31:19.826 --> 31:20.913
McGee, it's all right.

31:20.956 --> 31:23.043
Go with McGee.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.000
Anna has the right
to an attorney.

31:28.043 --> 31:29.391
Ma'am, you know the law.

31:29.434 --> 31:31.000
Please tell me you're not
going along with this.

31:31.956 --> 31:34.043
We're still looking
for a killer.

31:34.086 --> 31:35.347
Like Dave Lancellotti?

31:35.391 --> 31:37.000
You're barking up the
wrong tree, Agent Gibbs.

31:37.043 --> 31:38.956
I know the guy;
we're all locals.

31:39.000 --> 31:41.130
Dave may be a hothead,
but he's no killer.

31:41.173 --> 31:43.086
He's a hothead
no one has heard from.

31:44.434 --> 31:46.347
Look, Sergeant,
we know that you want answers.

31:46.391 --> 31:48.913
We want answers, too.

31:48.956 --> 31:52.826
Just make sure that we're
punishing the right person.

31:52.869 --> 31:54.086
[knocking]

31:54.130 --> 31:55.826
Gibbs.

31:55.869 --> 31:57.695
LoJack on Lancellotti's
truck just lit up.

31:57.739 --> 31:58.826
Get a location?

31:58.869 --> 31:59.826
Parked, not moving.

31:59.869 --> 32:01.043
I think we got him.

32:01.086 --> 32:02.565
I'll call you later.

32:02.608 --> 32:03.739
What about Anna Dillon?

32:03.782 --> 32:04.869
What about her?

32:04.913 --> 32:06.347
I want your word.

32:06.391 --> 32:07.782
When this is done,

32:07.826 --> 32:08.869
you let me do my job.

32:08.913 --> 32:10.869
Sergeant, we will all
do our jobs.

32:10.913 --> 32:12.913
I'm coming, too.

32:23.260 --> 32:25.434
McGEE:
Pickup's got a cap.

32:25.478 --> 32:27.478
Explains why Anna thought
it was an SUV.

32:27.521 --> 32:29.086
Let's move.

32:30.695 --> 32:32.695
[car doors closing]

32:35.652 --> 32:36.913
TONY:
Keep your eyes on him, Bishop.

32:36.956 --> 32:38.565
Dave Lancellotti!

32:38.608 --> 32:40.000
NCIS!

32:55.086 --> 32:56.913
Guess I was wrong.

33:05.043 --> 33:07.391
[phone chirps]

33:07.434 --> 33:09.608
Oh, more trouble, Mr. Palmer?

33:09.652 --> 33:12.826
It's Breena. She's asking me
to bring home milk and cookies.

33:12.869 --> 33:13.782
[phone chirps]

33:13.826 --> 33:15.956
And pepperoni.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.000
[phone chirps]

33:17.043 --> 33:18.782
And tuna fish.

33:18.826 --> 33:21.347
I hope she doesn't mean
pepperoni flavored tuna fish.

33:21.391 --> 33:23.304
Yes, well, strange cravings

33:23.347 --> 33:25.565
are very common in this
stage of pregnancy.

33:25.608 --> 33:28.739
Last week, she used chocolate
milk to make mashed potatoes.

33:28.782 --> 33:31.086
Mmm! I love that.

33:31.130 --> 33:33.956
Got me through my first year
of boarding school.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.217
Anything on our dead guy?

33:35.260 --> 33:36.652
Well, suffice to say,

33:36.695 --> 33:38.565
a gunshot wound to the temple

33:38.608 --> 33:41.608
that caused catastrophic damage
to the underlying tissue.

33:41.652 --> 33:43.217
I would think
that was sort of the point.

33:43.260 --> 33:45.434
But not for the reason
you surmise.

33:45.478 --> 33:46.608
Here.

33:46.652 --> 33:47.782
We found skin and hair fragments

33:47.826 --> 33:49.086
under the victim's fingernails.

33:49.130 --> 33:50.826
So he...

33:50.869 --> 33:52.739
touched the wound
after the gun went off?

33:52.782 --> 33:54.826
The only thing he could've done
after the gun discharged

33:54.869 --> 33:56.695
was twitch.

33:56.739 --> 33:58.391
The gunshot wound

33:58.434 --> 34:01.173
was used to cover up
a fatal blow to the temple,

34:01.217 --> 34:02.739
probably a metal pipe
or a wrench.

34:02.782 --> 34:06.130
Mr. Lancellotti's death was made
to look like a suicide.

34:06.173 --> 34:07.608
There was a wrench
in the toolbox

34:07.652 --> 34:08.826
in the back of the pickup.

34:08.869 --> 34:10.956
Well, then, I suggest you go

34:11.000 --> 34:13.000
and have Abby test it.

34:14.608 --> 34:16.347
I always knew when
JB joined the Navy,

34:16.391 --> 34:18.521
there was a chance
he wouldn't come back,

34:18.565 --> 34:20.956
but to have it happen
this way...

34:21.000 --> 34:23.260
When...

34:23.304 --> 34:24.739
his mother passed away,

34:24.782 --> 34:26.826
that boy was all I had.

34:27.826 --> 34:30.913
Now he's gone.

34:31.869 --> 34:33.173
CARRIE:
We can't begin to imagine

34:33.217 --> 34:35.869
to imagine what
you're going through, Mr. Hicks.

34:40.304 --> 34:41.956
You're the one?

34:42.000 --> 34:44.565
The one who
stopped and helped?

34:45.826 --> 34:47.695
They said you used
to be a medic?

34:47.739 --> 34:48.869
A hospital corpsman.

34:48.913 --> 34:50.347
Yes, sir.

34:51.782 --> 34:53.086
Thank you.

34:55.695 --> 34:57.347
Mr. Hicks...

34:57.391 --> 34:58.434
Call me John.

34:59.434 --> 35:01.434
John.

35:02.652 --> 35:05.913
When I first got there,
JB could hardly speak.

35:05.956 --> 35:08.434
But even still,

35:08.478 --> 35:11.217
all he cared about
was his friends.

35:11.260 --> 35:12.782
He told me to help them.

35:12.826 --> 35:16.304
Help them first.

35:16.347 --> 35:20.000
He was courageous
all the way to the end.

35:20.043 --> 35:21.347
And you should be proud.

35:21.391 --> 35:23.043
[sniffles]

35:23.086 --> 35:25.347
I was proud of JB
his whole life.

35:27.521 --> 35:29.391
Is it true...

35:29.434 --> 35:30.956
that you've been arrested?

35:32.695 --> 35:36.043
Anna is facing
potential jail time, yes.

35:36.086 --> 35:37.608
Well, that can't be right.

35:37.652 --> 35:38.739
She saved

35:38.782 --> 35:40.217
those kids' lives.

35:40.260 --> 35:41.434
It might not be right,

35:41.478 --> 35:43.130
but it's the law.

35:43.173 --> 35:45.043
Anna needs your help, Mr. Hicks.

35:45.086 --> 35:46.565
Say the word.

35:46.608 --> 35:48.173
Whatever she needs.

35:51.826 --> 35:53.434
Hey.
Hey.

35:53.478 --> 35:55.304
I heard you found the DNA
on that wrench.

35:55.347 --> 35:57.826
Yep, two samples
and some blood.

35:57.869 --> 36:01.260
Somebody tried
to wash it off, but, well,

36:01.304 --> 36:02.956
you know.

36:03.000 --> 36:04.652
Well, when you're good,
you're good, Abbs.

36:04.695 --> 36:06.043
That's right.

36:06.086 --> 36:07.608
I already got the results back

36:07.652 --> 36:09.217
on the business end
of this baby.

36:09.260 --> 36:10.608
Definitely the murder weapon.

36:10.652 --> 36:13.739
I'm just waiting on results
from the other sample.

36:15.782 --> 36:17.782
[computer trilling]

36:17.826 --> 36:20.521
It should be any second now.

36:22.695 --> 36:25.608
Well, you know,
a watched DNA never dings.

36:25.652 --> 36:27.260
We should talk.

36:28.260 --> 36:29.608
What do you want to talk about?

36:29.652 --> 36:30.608
Not Burt.

36:30.652 --> 36:31.565
[computer beeps]

36:31.608 --> 36:32.782
Oh, saved by the bell.

Okay.

36:45.782 --> 36:47.217

shipped out to Afghanistan.

36:47.260 --> 36:49.347
He was dishonorably discharged

petty officer.

he'll come this way?

she'll walk again.

I'm assuming you're gonna
break up with him,

38:45.608 --> 38:47.086
because of the two-month thing?

38:47.130 --> 38:48.826

38:48.869 --> 38:50.956
please don't make me talk
about this.

of Burt for not doing something

38:53.521 --> 38:55.347
he doesn't even know about.

38:55.391 --> 38:56.826

He has.

39:01.000 --> 39:02.391
when I meet the right guy,

39:02.434 --> 39:04.565
then the two-month thing
won't matter anymore.

39:04.608 --> 39:06.565
All I'm saying is give Burt
an extension.

39:06.608 --> 39:08.173
You never know.

40:06.521 --> 40:08.217
Carrie's a pro.

40:08.260 --> 40:09.739
She'll get you a good deal.

40:09.782 --> 40:11.826
I know, I know,
and I-I appreciate

40:11.869 --> 40:14.347
what you both
are doing for me, but...

40:14.391 --> 40:16.565
my life is on the line.

40:16.608 --> 40:17.782
Come here.

40:20.434 --> 40:22.434
Hold this.

40:27.173 --> 40:29.173
With the grain,
back and forth.

40:31.434 --> 40:33.869
Smooth, always with the grain.

40:38.130 --> 40:39.782
You think this will help?

40:39.826 --> 40:41.782
Helps me. Keep sanding.

40:42.782 --> 40:44.391
[chuckles]

40:44.434 --> 40:45.739
[knocking on door]

40:45.782 --> 40:47.000
[door creaks open]

40:58.260 --> 40:59.869
I've been at the Fairfax County
prosecutor's office

40:59.913 --> 41:01.173
all evening.

41:01.217 --> 41:02.260
I didn't want to tell you

41:02.304 --> 41:03.826
until I was sure
it was official.

41:03.869 --> 41:05.260
We have a deal?

41:05.304 --> 41:07.347
We do.

41:07.391 --> 41:08.608
And?

41:08.652 --> 41:10.608
The commonwealth attorney
reduced the charges.

41:10.652 --> 41:12.608
All you owe is
community service.

41:12.652 --> 41:13.956
What?

41:15.608 --> 41:17.391
How?

41:17.434 --> 41:19.043
Victims' parents, all of them,

41:19.086 --> 41:20.304
they went to Sergeant Harper.

41:20.347 --> 41:22.347
JB's dad said that
you were a hero,

41:22.391 --> 41:24.304
that you deserved
a commendation,

41:24.347 --> 41:25.434
not jail time.

41:25.478 --> 41:28.347
Oh, my God...

41:28.391 --> 41:29.739
This is amazing.

41:29.782 --> 41:31.434
Go to school, Dillon.

41:31.478 --> 41:33.521
Get certified.

41:33.565 --> 41:35.434
Keep helping people.

41:38.217 --> 41:39.565
What can I do to thank you?

41:44.434 --> 41:46.565
We should be thanking you,Doc.

41:46.608 --> 41:47.608
[laughs quietly]

41:49.608 --> 41:51.086
[sighs with relief, laughs]
