05:54.178 --> 05:56.700
- Can I help you?
- I don't know.

05:56.701 --> 06:00.304
The radiator's boiling.
It's never done that before.

06:00.305 --> 06:03.963
I had the water checked
on the mainland.

06:05.031 --> 06:08.955
- You've got anti-freeze in?
- Yes, you're supposed to in winter.

06:08.956 --> 06:10.878
That's what's causing
the overheating.

06:10.879 --> 06:15.094
I've taken my anti-freeze
out during this hot spell.

06:20.891 --> 06:25.375
This is the best I can do, unless
you want me to drain it off.

06:25.376 --> 06:26.657
No, not now.

06:26.658 --> 06:29.460
Tell me, is the Swan far from here?

06:29.461 --> 06:32.104
Take the next right.
You can't miss it.

06:32.105 --> 06:34.507
In fact, I'm going there myself.

06:34.508 --> 06:37.209
I'd offer to show you,

06:37.472 --> 06:40.810
but I think you should
let this cool down.

06:42.558 --> 06:45.338
Do I owe you anything?

06:45.962 --> 06:48.423
No. That's all right.

09:00.891 --> 09:04.614
This is the BBC Home Service.
Here's the weather forecast.

09:04.615 --> 09:07.618
Most districts will continue
to be extremely cold.

09:07.619 --> 09:10.502
Temperatures will remain
below freezing point,

09:10.503 --> 09:13.306
ranging from 24º in Northern areas

09:13.307 --> 09:16.509
to 29° in the South.

09:16.510 --> 09:21.075
However, there are exceptional
conditions on the Island of Fara.

09:21.076 --> 09:26.401
Temperatures are said to be in the
region of 90°, and still rising.

09:26.402 --> 09:29.846
90 degrees and still rising!

09:29.847 --> 09:33.411
- Surely it can't get any hotter.
- Apparently, it can.

09:33.412 --> 09:37.456
Yet on the mainland it's winter.
This weather doesn't make sense.

09:37.457 --> 09:41.380
Some rain wouldn't hurt.
At least it would cool the air.

09:41.381 --> 09:43.238
Thank you, Frankie.

10:14.363 --> 10:16.966
- Can I help you?
- Is Mr. Callum in?

10:16.967 --> 10:20.249
I'm afraid not. He's on his
way back from the mainland.

10:20.250 --> 10:24.054
- I'm Mrs. Callum.
- Angela Roberts, his new secretary.

10:24.055 --> 10:28.459
Oh, yes. My husband said the agency
was sending someone this week.

10:28.460 --> 10:31.063
I've a room ready for you.
I'll show you.

10:31.064 --> 10:35.068
I'd rather like a drink first. I'm
gasping, this heat is stifling.

10:35.069 --> 10:36.230
Yes, of course.

10:36.231 --> 10:39.674
May I have the pleasure?
My name is Stone, Dr Stone.

10:39.675 --> 10:42.838
Thank you, Doctor. I'll have
a lager and lime, please.

10:42.839 --> 10:45.299
And so you shall.

10:48.165 --> 10:50.888
Is this your first visit to
the island, Miss Roberts?

10:50.889 --> 10:55.414
Yes. It's very pretty. I had a drive
round after I got off the boat.

10:55.415 --> 10:57.256
It is hot, isn't it?

10:57.257 --> 11:00.339
We usually have the same
weather as the mainland.

11:00.340 --> 11:03.805
I'm sorry, the ice melts as
soon as it's out of the fridge.

11:05.026 --> 11:08.109
- Same again, Bob?
- No, just one for Tinker.

11:08.110 --> 11:11.529
I must be on my way. Just the one.

11:11.955 --> 11:14.371
Oh, that's better.

11:14.799 --> 11:18.803
If you don't mind, I'll finish this
upstairs. I'd like to freshen up.

11:18.804 --> 11:22.097
- Of course.
- I'll show you the way.

11:39.189 --> 11:43.633
- Is this all right for you?
- Yes, it's fine. Thanks.

11:43.634 --> 11:46.335
Let's have some air.

12:05.462 --> 12:08.744
Oh, I see you're reading
one of my husband's books.

12:08.745 --> 12:13.031
Yes. I thought I should. Is
his new novel interesting?

12:13.032 --> 12:17.836
He never talks about his books until
they're finished, then he never stops.

12:17.837 --> 12:23.022
- Have you worked with writers before?
- No. Mainly for publishers.

12:24.045 --> 12:27.568
God, it's hot. It's like
being in the Tropics.

12:27.569 --> 12:31.433
When my husband gets back,
I'll tell him you're here.

12:45.031 --> 12:48.794
- Has Callum brought my parcel?
- He'll be back soon, Mr. Hanson.

12:48.795 --> 12:52.055
Tell him to bring it
straight to my room.

12:56.045 --> 13:00.340
- Well, he's not very polite, is he?
- No.

13:01.011 --> 13:03.173
He's a strange character altogether.

13:03.174 --> 13:05.536
- How long is he staying?
- Hasn't said.

13:05.537 --> 13:08.539
We've been trying to
puzzle out what he does.

13:08.540 --> 13:11.864
Every day he goes out with his
camera and masses of equipment.

13:11.865 --> 13:14.227
He spends the rest of his
time locked in his room.

13:14.228 --> 13:16.269
He won't even let us in to clean.

13:16.270 --> 13:18.971
Good material for one
of Jeff's books.

13:37.257 --> 13:39.338
Bob, what the hell are you doing?

13:39.339 --> 13:41.981
Sorry, Jeff. I just
wasn't thinking.

13:41.982 --> 13:45.560
Thinking? You're lucky
to be breathing.

13:47.589 --> 13:50.724
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

13:50.794 --> 13:55.398
I thought I heard something.
I'm sure I heard something.

13:55.399 --> 13:58.522
- Heard what?
- I don't know.

13:58.523 --> 14:02.500
It was a sort of funny
whirring noise.

14:03.329 --> 14:05.130
Must be going off my rocker.

14:05.131 --> 14:09.255
- I assume you've come from the Swan?
- Maybe I did have one too many.

14:09.256 --> 14:13.073
It's this blasted heat.
Sorry again, Jeff.

14:13.102 --> 14:16.839
Forget it. No harm done.
But take it easy.

14:52.471 --> 14:56.074
Hi, Ken. Buying up the whole place?

14:56.075 --> 15:00.239
We've got to keep cool.
The Met Station's like an oven.

15:00.240 --> 15:01.921
They envy us on the mainland.

15:01.922 --> 15:04.284
My publisher's threatening
to pay me a visit.

15:04.285 --> 15:07.608
Tell him to bring some snow.
We could use it.

15:07.609 --> 15:10.492
Haven't you experts figured
out what's causing this heat?

15:10.493 --> 15:13.816
Or are we stuck with the villagers'
theory that it's the bomb?

15:13.817 --> 15:18.021
The bomb? To be perfectly honest,
one theory's as good as another.

15:18.022 --> 15:20.464
We haven't a clue. See you later.

15:20.465 --> 15:24.841
If the heat or the DTs
don't get you first!

15:38.608 --> 15:41.742
- Hello, darling.
- Hello.

15:46.618 --> 15:49.180
- Everything okay?
- Yes, thanks. Good trip?

15:49.181 --> 15:52.024
Yes, apart from nearly
knocking down Bob Hayward.

15:52.025 --> 15:55.708
He was in the middle of the road.
How I missed him, I don't know.

15:55.709 --> 15:58.792
Strange. He was all right
when he left here, wasn't he?

15:58.793 --> 16:01.115
- Is that Mr. Hanson's parcel?
- Yes. Why?

16:01.116 --> 16:03.077
He's been asking about it.

16:03.078 --> 16:05.560
He ordered it be taken to
his room, immediately.

16:05.561 --> 16:10.143
Did he? Must be important.
I'll take it up straight away.

16:24.225 --> 16:28.884
- Yes, who is it?
- Your parcel, Mr. Hanson.

16:31.114 --> 16:33.894
Come on, give it to me!

16:45.051 --> 16:48.614
I forgot to tell you. Your
new secretary has arrived.

16:48.615 --> 16:52.379
- She's quite the modern miss.
- Really? Where is she now?

16:52.380 --> 16:55.383
At the cove. She went for a swim.

16:55.384 --> 16:57.025
I'll give you a lift.

16:57.026 --> 17:00.728
Fine. I won't be long, darling.

17:25.520 --> 17:29.497
- I'll be off then, Jeff.
- Yeah.

17:59.442 --> 18:02.244
- Hello, Jeff.
- What the hell are you doing here?

18:02.245 --> 18:06.609
- You know why I'm here.
- Then you made a mistake.

18:06.610 --> 18:10.134
I hope you haven't unpacked.
You're not staying.

18:10.135 --> 18:12.217
Come for a swim. It's fabulous.

18:12.218 --> 18:14.380
Did you hear what I said?
You're getting out of here.

18:14.381 --> 18:18.545
Don't shout at me. You always
did go on. Cool down.

18:18.546 --> 18:20.066
Now listen to me,

18:20.067 --> 18:23.591
I'm not going through your
special brand of madness again.

18:23.592 --> 18:25.927
Aren't you?

18:26.555 --> 18:29.438
For 3 months, I wrote nothing.
I nearly wrecked my marriage.

18:29.439 --> 18:31.281
I'm not going through it again.

18:31.282 --> 18:35.304
You can't just have a
girl and then walk away.

18:35.647 --> 18:37.809
Don't pull that on me.

18:37.810 --> 18:41.148
You were no untouched
virgin when we met.

18:41.374 --> 18:46.019
How long was it before we tumbled
into your bed? Two hours?

18:46.020 --> 18:50.784
- You needn't wait so long this time.
- You haven't taken in a word.

18:50.785 --> 18:54.109
- You're clearing out.
- Just like that?

18:54.110 --> 18:56.162
Just like that.

18:58.195 --> 19:01.454
What are you going
to tell your wife?

19:01.719 --> 19:03.481
That's my problem.

19:03.482 --> 19:06.284
That you didn't like the look of me?

19:06.285 --> 19:11.185
As far as she's concerned,
I'm just your new secretary.

19:12.333 --> 19:15.416
You never did tell her
about us, did you?

19:19.101 --> 19:22.804
- What's that noise?
- I don't know.

19:22.826 --> 19:26.069
Sounds as if it came
from beyond the point.

19:28.312 --> 19:30.489
It's weird.

19:30.555 --> 19:32.077
Strange.

19:32.078 --> 19:37.182
Bob said he heard a peculiar noise
when I nearly ran him over.

19:52.663 --> 19:54.919
Jeff.

20:17.494 --> 20:19.910
Get dressed.

20:43.607 --> 20:45.728
What happened?

20:45.729 --> 20:49.893
I found him wandering on the road
by his meadow, in a fair old state.

20:49.894 --> 20:52.978
He keeps on about his
sheep being dead.

20:52.979 --> 20:54.900
What's the matter, Ben?

20:54.901 --> 20:58.544
It's my sheep. They all be dead.

20:58.545 --> 21:01.268
Someone's killed my sheep.

21:01.269 --> 21:04.472
- Can he lie down somewhere?
- There's a couch in my study.

21:04.473 --> 21:06.674
- How were they killed?
- Come on, Ben.

21:06.675 --> 21:10.599
- I said how were they killed?
- He's in no state to answer questions.

21:10.600 --> 21:14.204
I asked a straightforward question.
There's no harm in that.

21:14.205 --> 21:16.207
- You found the old man?
- Yes.

21:16.208 --> 21:18.089
- Did you see the sheep?
- No.

21:18.090 --> 21:21.987
Only Ben wandering about,
half out of his mind.

21:22.495 --> 21:25.778
- Who's he?
- He's a guest. His name's Hanson.

21:25.779 --> 21:28.742
Why is he so interested in
the sheep? What is he?

21:28.743 --> 21:33.358
I don't know. He spends his
time locked in his room.

22:22.850 --> 22:25.332
I'd like him to rest for a while.

22:25.333 --> 22:28.296
- Give time for the sedative to work.
- Of course.

22:28.297 --> 22:31.821
What do you think happened?
Do you think his sheep are all dead?

22:31.822 --> 22:36.226
Who can tell? With this heat it's
difficult to know what's going on.

22:36.227 --> 22:42.084
Give Mrs. Siddle a ring, will you?
Tell her I'll be bringing Ben home.

22:46.199 --> 22:48.171
Mr. Hanson...

22:51.327 --> 22:54.850
Why is he so interested
in how those sheep died?

22:54.851 --> 22:57.693
- Why don't you ask him?
- How's Ben?

22:57.694 --> 23:00.256
- He's calmed down.
- Did he say what happened?

23:00.257 --> 23:04.438
No. Mumbled they were dead.
Nothing coherent.

23:05.624 --> 23:09.919
The Doctor's not sure if it's
just the heat affecting him.

23:11.752 --> 23:14.915
Mrs. Siddle? Jeff Callum.
Ben's with us.

23:14.916 --> 23:19.000
He's not feeling well. Dr
Stone will bring him home.

23:19.001 --> 23:22.764
He thinks there's something
wrong with the sheep.

23:22.765 --> 23:28.348
What's that? I'm sorry,
I can't hear you.

23:28.732 --> 23:31.376
Don't worry. He'll be home soon!

23:42.109 --> 23:46.690
If the crisis is over,
I'd better start work.

23:47.956 --> 23:51.422
Where's the typewriter
and manuscript?

23:51.722 --> 23:54.024
Mr. Callum?

23:54.525 --> 23:57.499
- Jeff.
- You can't start.

23:58.210 --> 24:01.533
It's in the study
where Ben's resting.

24:01.534 --> 24:05.077
In that case, I'll go and change.

24:24.763 --> 24:27.925
- Yes?
- It's me. Can I come in?

24:27.926 --> 24:30.467
Yes, come in.

24:41.263 --> 24:44.476
Forget it. I didn't come for that.

24:46.510 --> 24:50.033
You're here now, but let's
get one thing straight...

24:50.034 --> 24:52.929
Can you hear me?

24:53.479 --> 24:55.360
Every word, darling.

24:55.361 --> 24:58.925
If Frankie finds out about
us, I'll break your neck.

25:01.609 --> 25:04.150
Miss Roberts.

25:08.938 --> 25:12.902
It's only me, Miss Roberts. I've
brought you some fresh towels.

25:12.903 --> 25:15.285
I'll put them on your bed.

25:21.674 --> 25:25.615
Would you mind handing
me one, please?

25:26.600 --> 25:28.821
Thanks.

25:36.653 --> 25:39.308
I could kill you.

25:50.870 --> 25:52.512
- Jeff.
- Yeah?

25:52.513 --> 25:54.794
Something's wrong with the TV.

25:54.795 --> 25:57.358
The phone's been playing up, too.

25:57.359 --> 26:00.457
It must be static
because of this heat.

26:03.165 --> 26:05.183
I'll turn it off.

26:06.289 --> 26:08.371
Bloody set.

26:08.372 --> 26:11.392
What's the matter with you?

26:20.948 --> 26:25.641
That's funny. It's never
done that before.

26:32.443 --> 26:35.223
That noise again.

26:41.694 --> 26:45.657
Stella, have you been playing
around with the telly?

26:45.658 --> 26:49.794
Of course I haven't.
I never touch the thing.

26:54.991 --> 26:56.592
Oh! What was that?

26:56.593 --> 26:58.754
Don't come in, there's
glass everywhere.

26:58.755 --> 27:01.117
- What happened?
- Get a dustpan and brush.

27:01.118 --> 27:03.320
- But...
- Get the dustpan.

27:03.321 --> 27:07.423
You don't want the dog
getting cut, do you?

27:33.759 --> 27:38.294
Jeff? Look, something's
happened and I...

27:39.005 --> 27:40.646
What's that?

27:40.647 --> 27:43.810
I can't shout, I don't
want Stella to hear.

27:43.811 --> 27:47.149
But you remember that noise...

27:47.816 --> 27:52.762
I said, remember that noise
I heard on the road?

27:53.744 --> 27:56.239
I'll come over.

28:02.595 --> 28:06.398
Stella, I'm just going to
go down to the village.

28:06.399 --> 28:09.322
I'll see if I can get
a replacement set.

28:09.323 --> 28:11.084
What a story!

28:11.086 --> 28:13.648
- What?
- You're off to Jeff Callum's.

28:13.649 --> 28:16.812
You men and your horse racing.

28:16.813 --> 28:19.855
We can't keep any secrets
from you women, can we?

28:19.856 --> 28:23.912
Hurry up. You'll
miss the next race.

28:49.973 --> 28:51.375
Patch!

28:58.685 --> 29:03.186
Patch, come back here!
Patch. Where...

29:05.173 --> 29:07.030
Oh!

29:22.235 --> 29:24.356
Here, Patch, here.

29:24.357 --> 29:27.775
Who told you to come, boy?

29:27.801 --> 29:31.174
You'd better stay, now you're here.

29:55.196 --> 29:57.691
What's the matter, boy?

30:20.027 --> 30:22.469
No!

30:22.470 --> 30:25.443
No!

31:07.846 --> 31:11.931
That's better. This was
a good idea of yours.

31:11.932 --> 31:15.954
My fingertips were
sticking to the keys.

31:16.297 --> 31:20.000
Some iced coffee will probably help.

31:23.947 --> 31:27.390
Don't you get bored here
with the isolation?

31:27.391 --> 31:29.521
Bored?

31:31.797 --> 31:36.855
Yes, I suppose so, at times.
But then, who doesn't?

31:37.083 --> 31:42.825
It's the sort of thing you learn
to live with in a place like this.

31:45.854 --> 31:50.018
What happened to
Mr. Callum's last secretary?

31:50.019 --> 31:54.042
Did she get lonely?
Is that why she left?

31:54.105 --> 31:58.081
As a matter of fact,
she didn't leave.

31:58.390 --> 32:01.524
Jeff had to ask her to go.

32:02.114 --> 32:05.758
- He sacked her? Why?
- She took a fancy to him.

32:05.759 --> 32:11.821
That made her a complication and
Jeff doesn't like complications.

32:12.207 --> 32:15.010
I can understand.
He's very attractive.

32:15.011 --> 32:18.414
She was wasting her time.
She didn't mean a thing to Jeff.

32:18.415 --> 32:21.097
- Of course.
- I'd have known if she had.

32:21.098 --> 32:24.862
- Do you really think so?
- Yes, I'm sure I would.

32:24.863 --> 32:27.425
But if he were just having
fun, would you know?

32:27.426 --> 32:32.291
Jeff doesn't play around.
It'd be all or nothing!

32:32.953 --> 32:37.277
It's a pity that such an attractive
man should shut himself away.

32:37.278 --> 32:39.560
It makes you wonder what
he's running away from.

32:39.561 --> 32:42.844
What do you mean?
What are you getting at?

32:42.845 --> 32:46.368
A man like that would
need a pretty good reason

32:46.369 --> 32:49.092
for coming to live in
a place like this.

32:49.093 --> 32:52.227
It's obvious he's running
away from something.

32:52.458 --> 32:57.482
And it's obvious you don't know him
or you wouldn't talk such nonsense!

32:59.546 --> 33:03.204
Oh, but I do. I do.

33:03.311 --> 33:06.433
I'm surprised Jeff hasn't
told you about me.

33:06.434 --> 33:10.038
He asked for me personally,
didn't you know?

33:10.039 --> 33:14.404
- Are you saying you knew him before?
- Knew him? That's an understatement.

33:14.405 --> 33:16.286
You little bitch! That's not true.

33:16.287 --> 33:20.892
Don't kid yourself he's different.
Men are all the same.

33:20.893 --> 33:24.630
Within half an hour of me
arriving, Jeff was kissing me.

33:26.820 --> 33:30.443
I don't believe you. You're lying.

33:34.350 --> 33:36.686
Yes, I am lying.

33:41.118 --> 33:45.459
Why? Why should you lie to me?

33:46.164 --> 33:49.207
I don't know. I was angry.

33:49.208 --> 33:52.251
It's an automatic reflex
when I'm being warned off.

33:52.252 --> 33:54.987
You were warning me off?

33:57.138 --> 33:59.190
Yes.

34:00.302 --> 34:03.879
Yes, I suppose I was.

35:15.556 --> 35:19.760
I thought I'd get a bit more
written before opening time.

35:19.761 --> 35:25.139
I expected it to cool down by
evening, but it's getting hotter.

35:25.248 --> 35:28.370
- Bob never turned up, did he?
- No.

35:28.371 --> 35:32.016
I thought he said he would, just
before the phone packed in.

35:32.017 --> 35:33.978
What did he want?

35:33.979 --> 35:37.623
He was on about some
noise he'd heard.

35:37.624 --> 35:40.826
Like the one we heard on the beach?

35:40.827 --> 35:44.644
Jeff... You don't mind
if I call you Jeff?

35:44.752 --> 35:47.074
- No, not at all.
- You said the noise

35:47.075 --> 35:51.690
came from beyond the point.
Is that where the sheep were?

35:51.802 --> 35:54.444
His farm is in that direction.

35:54.445 --> 35:58.945
- Do you think there's a connection?
- Do you, Jeff?

35:59.731 --> 36:01.612
No, I don't.

36:01.613 --> 36:04.456
I'm the one who's paid
to use my imagination.

36:04.457 --> 36:09.181
The next chapter. I'd like it
finished tonight, if possible.

36:09.182 --> 36:13.080
I'll take my coffee and
get the bar ready.

36:41.783 --> 36:45.999
Jeff... May I have a light?

37:02.930 --> 37:05.869
Your hand's trembling.

37:11.141 --> 37:15.721
I'm the same. Feel it beating?

37:21.513 --> 37:25.854
You know you want me.
Why try to deny it?

37:31.246 --> 37:33.376
Quiet.

37:36.052 --> 37:37.692
Listen.

37:41.538 --> 37:44.352
Jeff! Jeff!

37:44.942 --> 37:47.985
Something just landed
over by the hill.

37:47.986 --> 37:51.350
I was looking out of the window
and it landed in the field.

37:51.351 --> 37:54.313
- What did it look like?
- I couldn't tell.

37:54.314 --> 37:57.798
- There was glow coming from it.
- A glow?

37:57.799 --> 38:02.043
- Did it make a noise?
- That's what drew my attention to it.

38:02.044 --> 38:05.826
A whirring, whining...
whining noise.

38:23.550 --> 38:28.449
- It was from that direction?
- Yes, I think so.

38:46.219 --> 38:48.520
Jeff!

38:53.167 --> 38:58.225
- Let's get out of here. I'm scared.
- No. I want to find out who it is.

39:19.720 --> 39:23.604
Hanson! What was he doing up there?

39:23.605 --> 39:25.166
Maybe he saw something land.

39:25.167 --> 39:27.809
He wasn't coming
from that direction.

39:27.810 --> 39:31.013
Surely if he saw something,
he'd still be there.

39:31.014 --> 39:33.537
Maybe he wouldn't go over the hill.

39:33.538 --> 39:36.180
Maybe it's something
even he's scared of.

39:36.181 --> 39:39.103
He's crazy. Whatever he's
doing, he's obsessed by it.

39:39.104 --> 39:40.385
Yes. She's right.

39:40.386 --> 39:43.108
If we stay out here, we'll
all have nightmares.

39:43.109 --> 39:45.151
- Let's go back.
- Hold it!

39:45.152 --> 39:49.115
You said you saw something.
That's why we came out here.

39:49.116 --> 39:52.091
Did you or didn't you?

39:52.361 --> 39:55.364
Yes... I thought I did.

39:55.365 --> 39:58.768
I thought I saw
something coming down.

39:58.769 --> 40:04.054
It seemed to appear over the top
of the hill and move slowly down.

40:04.055 --> 40:06.017
But in this heat, I don't know.

40:06.018 --> 40:09.116
Stay here. I'm going
to take a look.

40:10.423 --> 40:12.666
Jeff, be careful.

40:12.667 --> 40:15.469
It must've been the other
side of that high ground.

40:15.470 --> 40:18.993
Let's get out of here. Wait
till tomorrow, when it's light.

40:18.994 --> 40:23.198
You can't leave us here and
I'm not going any further.

40:23.199 --> 40:26.242
All right. But I'll
tell you one thing.

40:26.243 --> 40:29.085
I've had enough of
Hanson creeping around.

40:29.086 --> 40:31.582
I'm going to ask him
what he's up to.

40:35.695 --> 40:37.817
Hanson, are you in there?

40:37.818 --> 40:40.660
Hanson, do you hear me?

40:40.661 --> 40:42.422
I can't talk now. Go away.

40:42.423 --> 40:47.709
Open this door! Hanson, open
this door, or I'll kick it down!

40:47.710 --> 40:50.808
No. Give me a moment.

40:52.116 --> 40:55.439
What are you doing?
What's going on?

40:57.763 --> 40:59.324
Hanson!

40:59.325 --> 41:01.421
Hanson!

41:04.290 --> 41:05.811
The door!

41:05.812 --> 41:08.094
Close the door, you idiot!

41:08.095 --> 41:10.016
What do you think you're doing?

41:10.017 --> 41:12.941
Never mind about me.
What are you up to?

41:12.942 --> 41:15.144
This is my hotel not
your bloody laboratory!

41:15.145 --> 41:17.426
I want some explanations,
Hanson. If that's your name.

41:17.427 --> 41:20.029
It is. And I don't owe
you any explanation.

41:20.030 --> 41:24.435
You do if you're using my hotel
as a centre of your activities.

41:24.436 --> 41:27.438
Were you out there to meet
whatever landed tonight?

41:27.439 --> 41:30.682
- Landed?
- You were prowling around out there.

41:30.683 --> 41:32.165
What's this about a landing?

41:32.166 --> 41:34.368
I came to ask questions,
not answer them.

41:34.369 --> 41:37.531
Yes, but this landing, what was it?

41:37.532 --> 41:41.874
I assure you I can explain,
but this is extremely important.

41:42.979 --> 41:46.702
Well, actually it was
my wife who saw it.

41:46.703 --> 41:48.745
- Go on.
- She heard a whirring noise.

41:48.746 --> 41:52.270
When she looked in its direction
she saw something glowing.

41:52.271 --> 41:55.354
- Yes?
- And she thought she saw it land.

41:55.355 --> 41:58.534
- Where?
- The other side of the hill.

42:00.721 --> 42:03.296
Do you know what it was?

42:03.885 --> 42:07.688
- Well?
- Yes. Yes, I do.

42:07.689 --> 42:10.390
What was it, Hanson?

42:11.175 --> 42:14.698
I don't expect you to believe
this, but for the past week

42:14.699 --> 42:18.903
I've been convinced this island
is the centre of an invasion.

42:18.904 --> 42:22.147
A landing point for beings
from another planet.

42:22.148 --> 42:25.391
Beings from another planet!

42:25.392 --> 42:29.075
Exactly. That's what has
caused this inexplicable heat.

42:29.076 --> 42:33.241
I've heard some yarns from villagers,
but your theory is too much.

42:33.242 --> 42:36.085
I'm not a superstitious
villager. I'm a scientist.

42:36.086 --> 42:39.288
I base my conclusions on
observations of fact.

42:39.289 --> 42:42.052
What do you suppose I'm doing here?

42:42.053 --> 42:45.949
I've been collecting
specimens. Soil.

42:46.498 --> 42:50.462
Blood of a sheep. I've
been analysing them.

42:50.463 --> 42:55.068
You asked for an explanation, but
you're too dim-witted to accept it.

42:55.069 --> 42:59.153
You've ruined everything with
your crass stupidity. Here...

42:59.154 --> 43:02.958
Perhaps I shouldn't have
broken in like that.

43:02.959 --> 43:06.242
So you've been trying to
photograph these things?

43:06.243 --> 43:10.527
I haven't been "trying",
I did photograph them.

43:10.528 --> 43:13.972
I used a normal lens at
first, but it was ineffective

43:13.973 --> 43:18.217
against the intense light that
emanates from these beings.

43:18.218 --> 43:20.981
Remember that parcel
you collected for me?

43:20.982 --> 43:25.386
It contained this.
An infra red filter.

43:25.387 --> 43:28.549
I experimented with a special
camera and placed it...

43:28.550 --> 43:32.635
Here. I used a mirror reflector
and rigged up the shutter

43:32.636 --> 43:36.200
to be triggered by anything
crossing its line of vision.

43:36.201 --> 43:39.964
- And something did come through?
- Yes, it did!

43:39.965 --> 43:43.128
I was developing the picture
when you burst into the room.

43:43.129 --> 43:46.091
It would've given me the
proof I so desperately need.

43:46.092 --> 43:50.673
Then what you've told me
so far is pure conjecture?

43:56.105 --> 43:59.068
- Cinders?
- Incinerated by whatever was here.

43:59.069 --> 44:03.113
The same happened to the sheep.
They were burned to death.

44:03.114 --> 44:05.155
There's been some
sort of incineration,

44:05.156 --> 44:09.120
but it doesn't have to be a
being from another planet.

44:09.121 --> 44:11.884
I've analysed that, Callum.

44:11.885 --> 44:14.127
It was burned by a
high frequency heat,

44:14.128 --> 44:16.530
more intense than
anything we can produce,

44:16.531 --> 44:19.253
even under strict
laboratory conditions.

44:19.254 --> 44:23.258
There's only one place where
that kind of heat exists.

44:23.259 --> 44:26.542
Out there, where the
cosmic gases ferment

44:26.543 --> 44:30.627
and generate a heat greater
than anything we can imagine.

44:30.628 --> 44:33.431
That's where those
beings must come from.

44:33.432 --> 44:38.037
If you're right, how are they
getting here? Where are they?

44:38.038 --> 44:41.841
If we knew, we could destroy
them before it's too late.

44:41.842 --> 44:47.168
Tell me, has anybody else
heard this whirring noise?

44:47.169 --> 44:51.734
Yes, Bob did. In the lane,
over by the gravel pits.

44:51.735 --> 44:54.097
Somewhere in this area.

45:09.136 --> 45:12.875
Here, boy. What's the matter?

45:14.243 --> 45:16.499
Callum!

45:26.819 --> 45:28.996
Come on.

45:57.317 --> 45:59.619
I've found it.

45:59.840 --> 46:01.812
Callum, look.

46:09.772 --> 46:12.554
This doesn't affect you at all!

46:14.299 --> 46:18.182
I appreciate how you feel.
I know he was a friend of yours,

46:18.183 --> 46:20.665
but that won't do any
good now. Look.

46:20.666 --> 46:23.589
Every particle of energy
has been sucked out of it.

46:23.590 --> 46:29.491
Hanson... We've got to warn
people. They should be told.

46:29.957 --> 46:32.761
No, not yet.

46:32.762 --> 46:37.326
You forced your way in on me.
You had to know, didn't you?

46:37.327 --> 46:39.729
Now you're going to do what I say.

46:39.730 --> 46:43.333
The authorities have
dismissed me as a crank,

46:43.334 --> 46:44.975
just like you did.

46:44.976 --> 46:47.579
But I must have evidence,

46:47.580 --> 46:50.703
and I would've got it if you
hadn't destroyed that photograph.

46:50.704 --> 46:53.106
I need time to complete my tests.

46:53.107 --> 46:55.950
- How much time?
- Two or three hours.

46:55.951 --> 46:59.354
As for warning the villagers,
we must avoid injecting fear

46:59.355 --> 47:02.727
into an already dangerous situation.

47:06.443 --> 47:10.181
Callum, have you noticed something?

47:11.010 --> 47:13.061
This heat,

47:13.813 --> 47:18.097
at this time of night it
should be getting cooler,

47:18.098 --> 47:20.912
but it's building up.

47:25.827 --> 47:30.112
- It's getting hotter, Frankie.
- I think you're right, it is.

47:30.113 --> 47:33.691
- There you are.
- Thanks, my dear.

47:46.974 --> 47:50.337
Oh, what an atmosphere.

47:50.338 --> 47:54.155
They've probably heard
about Ben Siddle.

48:02.193 --> 48:06.534
I think I'd better finish
that typing, Mrs. Callum.

48:12.967 --> 48:17.501
No wonder the temperature's up.
Who's been hiding her?

48:18.574 --> 48:20.955
Beer, Hanson?

48:21.978 --> 48:24.872
Frankie, pull me a lager.

48:25.582 --> 48:28.224
- Is something wrong?
- No, nothing.

48:28.225 --> 48:32.248
- Jeff, I know you.
- There's nothing wrong!

48:33.192 --> 48:38.536
I'm sorry, it's this damned
heat that's making me jumpy.

48:38.639 --> 48:41.922
We've been getting on
each other's nerves too.

48:41.923 --> 48:44.418
That's why I came here.

48:45.247 --> 48:47.708
That shows how hot it is.

48:53.057 --> 48:56.156
Smash the bottles! All of them!

49:02.628 --> 49:07.573
- I'll get the first aid kit.
- I'll get it. You'll never find it.

49:11.200 --> 49:14.298
What on earth's going on out there?

49:18.849 --> 49:21.983
The heat exploded the bottles.

49:22.293 --> 49:25.347
It's unbearable, isn't it?

49:59.860 --> 50:02.702
- Here we are.
- Don't touch me.

50:02.703 --> 50:04.945
I only want to put a
plaster on your arm.

50:04.946 --> 50:07.468
- Let Ken do it.
- What's the matter?

50:07.469 --> 50:08.990
Let it go, Callum.

50:08.991 --> 50:13.173
This heat is bound to lead to
irrational behaviour. I'll do it.

52:16.311 --> 52:18.966
I'll get Dr. Stone.

52:42.303 --> 52:46.119
Come on, Tinker. Back to the pub.

52:46.147 --> 52:49.725
It's all right. Come on. That's it.

53:04.570 --> 53:08.785
It was Tinker.
He jumped me. Come on.

55:11.110 --> 55:13.924
Callum, come here.

55:17.117 --> 55:21.982
Look at the gas cylinder. It's split
open, just like the car battery.

55:22.003 --> 55:27.688
Completely drained of
every ounce of energy.

55:27.689 --> 55:33.617
Tinker? It's impossible. I can't
believe he'd do a thing like that.

55:33.618 --> 55:38.222
Not under normal circumstances, but
these are not normal circumstances.

55:38.223 --> 55:42.627
If this heat goes on increasing,
it could drive us all insane.

55:42.628 --> 55:46.272
The body isn't equipped for such
pressure. The glands will fail.

55:46.273 --> 55:50.798
Then, it's only a matter of time
before the brain is affected.

55:50.799 --> 55:54.242
A logical conclusion, but we
should keep it to ourselves.

55:54.243 --> 55:58.447
That's what Hanson keeps saying.
Two men have been killed.

55:58.448 --> 56:02.186
- Two?
- Who's been killed?

56:04.335 --> 56:07.218
- How's the girl?
- She's all right.

56:07.219 --> 56:09.919
Who's been killed?

56:10.264 --> 56:14.525
Will someone tell
me what's going on?

56:15.310 --> 56:18.913
I'm afraid Tinker's
met with an accident.

56:18.914 --> 56:22.891
Jeff, who else is dead?
You mentioned two.

56:23.199 --> 56:27.083
- Bob Hayward.
- Bob! How?

56:27.084 --> 56:28.845
It was an accident.

56:28.846 --> 56:33.586
- Accident? He was...
- Callum, calm down.

56:33.813 --> 56:38.617
These creatures are killing God knows
how many, and that's your answer?

56:38.618 --> 56:41.661
Creatures? What do
you mean, creatures?

56:41.662 --> 56:46.003
- He shouldn't have told you.
- What do you know that I don't?

56:49.771 --> 56:53.816
He claims we're being attacked by
creatures from another planet.

56:53.817 --> 56:57.741
Claims? What do you mean?
You've seen them?

56:57.742 --> 57:00.384
Bob Hayward and Tinker did.

57:00.385 --> 57:03.788
I don't understand.
I don't understand.

57:03.789 --> 57:06.311
- Neither do I, Frankie.
- Here.

57:06.312 --> 57:09.675
His thinks the island is being used
as a test base for an invasion.

57:09.676 --> 57:12.560
- Don't ask me why.
- It's quite obvious.

57:12.561 --> 57:15.844
They have to discover if they
can survive in our atmosphere.

57:15.845 --> 57:18.006
- That's incredible.
- Is it?

57:18.007 --> 57:21.731
We probe space searching for
information about other planets.

57:21.732 --> 57:25.495
It's logical that same thing
might happen in reverse.

57:25.496 --> 57:29.139
Are you saying that Earth has
become a subject of a probe

57:29.140 --> 57:31.423
carried out by creatures
from another planet?

57:31.424 --> 57:32.785
Yes, I am.

57:32.786 --> 57:37.470
And what I saw land tonight
was one of those creatures?

57:37.471 --> 57:39.523
Yes.

57:40.155 --> 57:42.516
One of them, forming a spearhead

57:42.517 --> 57:45.760
to find out if life is
possible for them on Earth.

57:45.761 --> 57:48.496
And if it is possible?

57:48.845 --> 57:51.729
Then, the main force will come.

57:51.730 --> 57:55.012
Have you any idea what
they need to survive?

57:55.013 --> 57:58.777
Heat. The way that car battery
and cylinder were split

57:58.778 --> 58:01.020
suggests they were
seeking heat energy.

58:01.021 --> 58:04.223
- They obviously need it to exist.
- Fine, fine!

58:04.224 --> 58:08.348
We'll just wait for you
to complete your tests!

58:08.349 --> 58:13.808
The temperature has risen three
degrees in the last half hour. 108.

58:15.639 --> 58:18.321
At this rate, we'll
all dead by morning.

58:18.322 --> 58:21.005
I accept that the
situation is serious.

58:21.006 --> 58:23.367
The indications are that
we're approaching a crisis.

58:23.368 --> 58:27.372
- Hanson!
- Getting emotional won't help.

58:27.373 --> 58:30.586
- We must alert the mainland.
- How?

58:31.099 --> 58:32.780
The telephone's out of action.

58:32.781 --> 58:37.305
What about the Met station? They can
send a message. I'll drive up there.

58:37.306 --> 58:41.190
Just a moment, Doctor. This
could be very dangerous.

58:41.191 --> 58:44.514
Someone must go. We've
lost enough time already.

58:44.515 --> 58:48.537
Very well. But don't
go until I come back.

58:51.124 --> 58:55.728
- I'll come with you.
- There's no point both of us going.

58:55.729 --> 58:58.131
You stay and look after the girls.

58:58.132 --> 59:00.654
And Jeff, I should leave that alone.

59:00.655 --> 59:04.198
Too much of it doesn't
help in a crisis.

59:06.502 --> 59:08.904
This will help us keep in touch.

59:08.905 --> 59:12.830
Aerial, press to speak,
release to receive. Got it?

59:12.831 --> 59:15.247
Yes. Thank you.

59:15.354 --> 59:17.895
Good luck, Doctor.

59:18.798 --> 59:23.173
- And be careful.
- Don't worry, I will.

59:25.886 --> 59:30.130
These creatures, are they
likely to attack us?

59:30.131 --> 59:32.134
Depends what they're looking for.

59:32.135 --> 59:36.139
I think they're looking for an
energy source to keep them alive.

59:36.140 --> 59:40.958
But once they've found it
they'll spread to the mainland.

59:41.106 --> 59:43.043
Yes.

59:52.881 --> 59:54.852
Hello, Hanson.

59:55.203 --> 59:57.825
Are you there, Hanson?

59:58.688 --> 01:00:02.932
Yes, Stone. I can hear you.
Where are you?

01:00:02.933 --> 01:00:08.037
I'm on the road to the point.
I've just passed White's Meadow.

01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:13.720
I can see the outline of the
Met station in the distance.

01:00:16.710 --> 01:00:20.874
The radiator's boiling up.
She's losing power.

01:00:20.875 --> 01:00:23.496
How far is the station?

01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:29.903
I'm not sure. About a mile
and a quarter I should say.

01:00:31.129 --> 01:00:33.350
She's slowing down.

01:00:34.252 --> 01:00:37.816
She won't last long. The
heat's affecting the engine.

01:00:37.817 --> 01:00:40.597
It's very dark out here.

01:00:42.903 --> 01:00:45.444
She's pulling badly.

01:00:48.069 --> 01:00:52.490
The gravel pit's coming up.
I can make out the entrance.

01:01:00.124 --> 01:01:02.585
She's stopping.

01:01:09.015 --> 01:01:13.277
It's no good. I'll have to
leave her. I'll walk the rest.

01:02:11.654 --> 01:02:14.867
Hanson, I'm on the road.

01:02:15.859 --> 01:02:18.742
There's a gap in the fence.

01:02:18.743 --> 01:02:21.625
It looks like something...

01:02:21.626 --> 01:02:24.709
- It's that noise again.
- Get away from there!

01:02:24.710 --> 01:02:27.251
Get away! It's your only chance.

01:02:27.633 --> 01:02:32.499
I can't hear you! It's this noise!

01:02:55.428 --> 01:02:58.551
Stone. Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

01:02:58.552 --> 01:03:01.526
Get away from that sound.

01:03:06.482 --> 01:03:10.264
What's wrong? Isn't it working?

01:03:11.329 --> 01:03:15.510
Yes, Mrs. Callum.
The set's working.

01:03:19.699 --> 01:03:22.354
It's horrible.

01:03:24.224 --> 01:03:26.355
What now?

01:03:26.627 --> 01:03:29.750
- It depends.
- On what?

01:03:29.751 --> 01:03:34.917
Whether that meeting was an accident
or a deliberate interception.

01:03:34.918 --> 01:03:39.642
If it was deliberate, it means we're
not dealing with brute monsters,

01:03:39.643 --> 01:03:42.166
but with a superior intelligence.

01:03:42.167 --> 01:03:44.548
Which do you think it is?

01:03:46.332 --> 01:03:51.949
I don't know, Mrs Callum.
I honestly don't know.

01:03:53.101 --> 01:03:56.624
There must be an answer
to these things.

01:03:56.625 --> 01:03:59.467
We've got to try again.
I'm going this time.

01:03:59.468 --> 01:04:01.599
Wait, Callum.

01:04:01.871 --> 01:04:04.433
If you go out, you risk
sacrificing another life.

01:04:04.434 --> 01:04:08.318
The Doctor took the risk.
We can't just leave him there.

01:04:08.319 --> 01:04:10.370
No!

01:04:11.123 --> 01:04:12.444
I'll have to go.

01:04:12.445 --> 01:04:14.566
I'm not being heroic.

01:04:14.567 --> 01:04:16.248
Stone was taken by surprise

01:04:16.249 --> 01:04:19.092
I'm better equipped to
deal with this situation.

01:04:19.093 --> 01:04:21.314
He's right, Jeff.

01:04:23.658 --> 01:04:26.996
I'll take your Land Rover.
Have you got the keys?

01:04:27.383 --> 01:04:31.067
Supposing they're still out
there, what will you do?

01:04:31.068 --> 01:04:36.890
If they are, I'll have to avoid
making the same mistakes as Stone.

01:04:37.195 --> 01:04:41.650
Keep these doors locked
and that set switched on.

01:04:47.888 --> 01:04:50.909
Lock the windows, Frankie.

01:05:04.149 --> 01:05:08.934
Angela. It's all right. There's
nothing to be afraid of.

01:05:11.759 --> 01:05:14.121
I must've had a nightmare.

01:05:14.122 --> 01:05:17.805
I kept seeing that man
coming towards me.

01:05:17.806 --> 01:05:21.009
His hands... I thought...

01:05:21.010 --> 01:05:25.750
It's all right, Angela.
It's all right. He's gone now.

01:05:26.096 --> 01:05:29.913
There's no need to be afraid.
Come on. Lie down.

01:05:54.612 --> 01:05:59.796
I shouldn't think we'll hear from
Hanson yet. It's too soon.

01:05:59.979 --> 01:06:03.342
You knew her before, didn't you?

01:06:03.343 --> 01:06:07.507
- Who?
- You know who I mean. That girl.

01:06:07.508 --> 01:06:11.513
- You knew her before she came here.
- No.

01:06:11.514 --> 01:06:13.610
Don't lie to me, Jeff.

01:06:14.837 --> 01:06:16.879
I've said I didn't know her.

01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:20.093
I saw you kissing her in the study.

01:06:20.604 --> 01:06:22.766
That doesn't mean I knew her.

01:06:22.767 --> 01:06:26.571
Ever since she came here,
you've been tense.

01:06:26.572 --> 01:06:29.414
Just as you were before we moved.

01:06:29.415 --> 01:06:31.057
Frankie, let it be.

01:06:31.058 --> 01:06:33.420
You did know her.

01:06:33.421 --> 01:06:36.544
All right, I knew her.
Leave it at that.

01:06:36.545 --> 01:06:39.547
It wasn't difficulty with
your writing. It was her.

01:06:39.548 --> 01:06:42.230
- That why we moved here.
- Drop it, Frankie.

01:06:42.231 --> 01:06:46.275
You're overwrought. The heat
is affecting us all. Let it go.

01:06:46.276 --> 01:06:48.897
Are you in love with her?

01:06:50.923 --> 01:06:53.565
Answer me. Are you
in love with her?

01:06:53.566 --> 01:06:56.488
Not now, Frankie. We're
fighting for our lives!

01:06:56.489 --> 01:07:00.113
It's important to me. I must know.

01:07:00.775 --> 01:07:04.298
Tell me, are you in love with her?

01:07:04.299 --> 01:07:06.156
No.

01:07:09.265 --> 01:07:15.372
- Then, what is it?
- I wanted her. I wanted her body!

01:07:17.596 --> 01:07:22.160
Now you know. She was a
slut and I wanted her.

01:07:22.161 --> 01:07:25.215
But not any more.
I didn't ask her here.

01:07:26.286 --> 01:07:28.808
She's no more than a common slut.

01:07:28.809 --> 01:07:32.333
There's no comparison
with what I feel for you.

01:07:32.334 --> 01:07:37.099
That's why we moved here. It was
completely physical, I promise.

01:07:37.100 --> 01:07:40.438
She never meant a thing
to me. She never will.

01:07:49.275 --> 01:07:52.799
Where is everybody?
Where's the doctor?

01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:55.082
He's not here. Go
back to the study.

01:07:55.083 --> 01:07:57.004
Get him! I need him!

01:07:57.005 --> 01:07:59.739
He can't come. Go
back and lie down.

01:08:00.129 --> 01:08:02.611
He should be here. I'm ill.

01:08:02.612 --> 01:08:05.214
I need him. Where the hell is he?

01:08:05.215 --> 01:08:08.578
He can't come, you selfish
bitch! He's dead.

01:08:11.503 --> 01:08:14.762
Dead? Dead...

01:08:15.268 --> 01:08:17.205
Dead...

01:09:28.198 --> 01:09:30.439
Callum. Callum.

01:09:30.441 --> 01:09:32.604
This is Hanson. This is Hanson.

01:09:32.604 --> 01:09:34.005
He's found the other one.

01:09:34.006 --> 01:09:37.009
Can you hear me? Callum?
Can you hear me?

01:09:37.010 --> 01:09:40.573
- Why don't you answer?
- I can hear you. Where are you?

01:09:40.573 --> 01:09:45.997
I'm at the gravel pit.
I've found Stone's body.

01:09:46.461 --> 01:09:48.352
He's dead.

01:09:48.783 --> 01:09:53.160
He's burnt to death.
Just like all the others.

01:09:55.032 --> 01:09:58.556
The ground here is all scorched.

01:09:58.557 --> 01:10:02.021
This is obviously the way they came.

01:10:06.526 --> 01:10:12.554
I can see something. Something
glowing down in the pit.

01:10:13.616 --> 01:10:16.635
It's getting hotter.

01:10:18.542 --> 01:10:20.923
I'm going in.

01:10:21.946 --> 01:10:25.549
Hanson, remember two people
have already died there.

01:10:25.550 --> 01:10:28.284
It's horrible. What's
he doing there?

01:10:41.730 --> 01:10:46.709
It's very dark in here.
I can't see very far.

01:10:59.192 --> 01:11:01.893
I can see it again.

01:11:04.919 --> 01:11:07.255
It certainly is a light source.

01:11:07.322 --> 01:11:10.217
The light seems to be...

01:11:13.010 --> 01:11:14.771
I'm not receiving you.

01:11:17.776 --> 01:11:21.659
- Hanson, do you hear me?
- Why doesn't he answer?

01:11:21.660 --> 01:11:23.632
Hanson!

01:11:26.586 --> 01:11:29.268
He's not coming through.

01:11:42.046 --> 01:11:45.128
It's a woman!
I'll have to stop her.

01:12:05.234 --> 01:12:09.097
Of course. The light!

01:12:11.082 --> 01:12:16.824
What are we going to do? What
the hell are we going to do?

01:12:17.010 --> 01:12:20.893
The area beyond the gravel pit
must be their assembly point.

01:12:20.894 --> 01:12:23.456
I saw one down there.

01:12:23.457 --> 01:12:26.700
What happened? The set
went off. Are you all right?

01:12:26.701 --> 01:12:30.505
Yes. The aerial must've
been screened by the pit.

01:12:30.506 --> 01:12:33.270
I've discovered something
very important.

01:12:33.271 --> 01:12:37.875
They're attracted to light. To
them, it's a source of energy.

01:12:37.876 --> 01:12:40.197
Turn out all your lights.
Do you hear?

01:12:40.198 --> 01:12:43.481
Yes, I hear you. Is
there anything else?

01:12:43.482 --> 01:12:46.525
No, I'm going on now.

01:12:46.526 --> 01:12:48.487
I'll drive without lights.

01:12:48.488 --> 01:12:52.352
I'll contact you when
I get to the station.

01:12:54.977 --> 01:12:57.677
Thank God he's all right.

01:13:10.636 --> 01:13:13.760
He must've seen the
creatures themselves.

01:13:13.761 --> 01:13:16.461
I wonder how many there are.

01:13:28.018 --> 01:13:30.718
I'll get the orange juice.

01:13:32.344 --> 01:13:36.268
How long do you think
he'll take to get there?

01:13:36.269 --> 01:13:40.610
Not long... If he gets through.

01:14:57.511 --> 01:15:00.513
He ought to be there by now.

01:15:00.514 --> 01:15:05.479
- Why doesn't he contact us?
- Jeff, don't panic, please.

01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:08.443
If it's possible to get
through, he'll manage.

01:15:08.444 --> 01:15:13.424
How do you know? How do you
know he's not dead as well?

01:15:17.215 --> 01:15:21.112
It's only five miles to the point.

01:15:21.781 --> 01:15:25.404
He ought to be arriving any moment.

01:15:30.392 --> 01:15:34.094
Intermediate frequency.
Range four...

01:15:34.277 --> 01:15:37.920
Four miles? No wonder we
haven't heard from him.

01:15:37.921 --> 01:15:41.564
If he's at the Met station,
he's out of range.

01:15:41.565 --> 01:15:45.289
What do we do if he's out
of range? Do we just wait?

01:15:45.290 --> 01:15:49.133
- I can't stand it another minute!
- I want to get away too.

01:15:49.134 --> 01:15:52.819
- We must go to the Met station.
- Anything's better than this.

01:15:52.820 --> 01:15:57.765
We'll take your car. I know a
short cut. Come on, darling.

01:15:59.548 --> 01:16:02.602
I'll drive. I know the way.

01:16:10.362 --> 01:16:12.844
We were in the office
when the lights blew.

01:16:12.845 --> 01:16:17.049
We heard the explosion
and found the operator.

01:16:17.050 --> 01:16:21.664
We got him to the wardroom but
he was dead. Burnt to death.

01:16:21.776 --> 01:16:26.071
That explains it. That
finally explains it.

01:16:26.221 --> 01:16:30.225
Would you mind letting
us in on the secret?

01:16:30.226 --> 01:16:35.111
Simple. Your station is the means
by which these beings got here.

01:16:35.112 --> 01:16:37.528
This station?

01:16:38.396 --> 01:16:42.520
You must be aware that we've been
sending out high frequency impulses

01:16:42.521 --> 01:16:44.202
to explore space.

01:16:44.203 --> 01:16:46.285
Bouncing signals off stars?

01:16:46.286 --> 01:16:51.630
Exactly. To us, these impulses
are useful, but quite harmless.

01:16:51.814 --> 01:16:55.016
But to these beings, they
represent a life force.

01:16:55.017 --> 01:16:57.059
- I see.
- Do you?

01:16:57.060 --> 01:17:00.983
We attracted them, but that doesn't
explain how they got here.

01:17:00.984 --> 01:17:03.547
It's quite obvious, isn't it?

01:17:03.548 --> 01:17:06.270
They must've homed
in on your scanner.

01:17:06.271 --> 01:17:10.436
These beings are composed of high
frequency impulses in heat form.

01:17:10.437 --> 01:17:13.399
They transfer like any
form of high frequency.

01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:16.884
They transferred here
like a TV picture,

01:17:16.885 --> 01:17:18.606
from a transmitter to a receiver.

01:17:18.607 --> 01:17:21.449
- Using our scanner as a receiver.
- Exactly.

01:17:21.450 --> 01:17:25.133
- Then they materialised on Earth.
- Materialised?

01:17:25.134 --> 01:17:28.257
In the same way as a
satellite TV picture.

01:17:28.258 --> 01:17:32.343
It starts in space as a
signal and then materialises.

01:17:32.344 --> 01:17:34.786
Do you realise what you're saying?

01:17:34.787 --> 01:17:39.271
The Earth's surface is dotted
with TV and radar scanners.

01:17:39.272 --> 01:17:43.957
If these beings succeed, they'll
heat up the whole surface.

01:17:43.958 --> 01:17:46.520
Earth will be just
another hot planet.

01:17:46.521 --> 01:17:49.363
Like so many others
in the constellation.

01:17:49.364 --> 01:17:53.770
We've got to stop them. We must
destroy them before they destroy us.

01:17:53.771 --> 01:17:56.573
- Have you got any explosives?
- No.

01:17:56.574 --> 01:17:58.896
Just a couple of
revolvers and some ammo.

01:17:58.897 --> 01:18:02.781
- We've got some flare guns.
- Get them.

01:18:02.782 --> 01:18:05.984
Wait, the quarry. There'll
be gelignite there.

01:18:05.985 --> 01:18:10.351
- Anybody there you can contact?
- Like hell. I'll get it myself.

01:18:10.352 --> 01:18:13.554
I'll be glad to apologise if we
succeed. I'll take the van.

01:18:13.555 --> 01:18:17.559
Whatever you do, don't
forget: Drive without lights.

01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:21.024
I'm getting to be quite a criminal.

01:18:23.467 --> 01:18:27.842
She's slowing down.
She'll blow any moment.

01:18:28.393 --> 01:18:31.837
Come on, damn you. Keep going.

01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:37.777
It's that noise again.
I can hear it.

01:18:54.866 --> 01:18:56.988
- Angela.
- Is she all right?

01:18:56.989 --> 01:18:59.351
I missed her. But only just.

01:18:59.352 --> 01:19:02.875
She heard you coming and panicked.
Have you seen Hanson?

01:19:02.876 --> 01:19:04.437
- He's at the station.
- Good.

01:19:04.438 --> 01:19:06.559
They got to us.

01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:10.524
- Anyone hurt?
- Yes, the operator. Burnt to death.

01:19:10.525 --> 01:19:13.181
Are you all right?

01:19:14.331 --> 01:19:17.669
She's put the car in the ditch.

01:19:19.096 --> 01:19:23.232
I'll give you a hand.
Here, sit down.

01:19:26.625 --> 01:19:28.802
Under the wheel.

01:19:30.190 --> 01:19:34.213
Right, start her up.
All right, push.

01:19:34.436 --> 01:19:37.375
Put her in reverse.

01:19:45.008 --> 01:19:48.011
I'll take Angela with me.
It'll lighten your load.

01:19:48.012 --> 01:19:50.064
Right.

01:19:59.427 --> 01:20:01.829
- Have you contacted the mainland?
- No.

01:20:01.830 --> 01:20:04.071
Here, Frankie.

01:20:04.072 --> 01:20:06.124
Here we are.

01:20:06.956 --> 01:20:10.119
Fine. Tie them in bundles
of three like I told you.

01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:13.484
This is the plan. We split
up into two groups.

01:20:13.485 --> 01:20:15.326
- Is that a good idea?
- It's essential.

01:20:15.327 --> 01:20:17.528
You know the hayricks
out on the point?

01:20:17.529 --> 01:20:21.173
Foster and I will go up
there and I'll set fire them.

01:20:21.174 --> 01:20:25.578
Wait. You said these creatures
were attracted by light.

01:20:25.579 --> 01:20:27.500
It'll bring them out into the open.

01:20:27.501 --> 01:20:30.624
Foster will intercept them with
the dynamite. I'll double back.

01:20:30.625 --> 01:20:33.469
- What'll we do?
- Go to the top of the cliff.

01:20:33.470 --> 01:20:36.793
As soon as the fires are alight, use
the flares to alert the mainland.

01:20:36.794 --> 01:20:41.932
- There's nothing else we can do?
- Has anybody got any better ideas?

01:20:43.882 --> 01:20:47.525
It'll take us 15 minutes
to get to the hayricks.

01:20:47.526 --> 01:20:51.331
When you spot my first flare,
it's your signal to move.

01:20:51.332 --> 01:20:53.428
Foster.

01:20:53.855 --> 01:20:56.909
Remember, 15 minutes.

01:21:08.432 --> 01:21:10.688
Can you see them?

01:21:12.679 --> 01:21:17.123
Why do you think Hanson
split us into two groups?

01:21:17.124 --> 01:21:21.448
If he and Foster fail,
it'll be up to us.

01:21:21.449 --> 01:21:23.771
That's what I thought.

01:21:23.772 --> 01:21:27.455
He's a peculiar chap,
but he's got guts.

01:21:27.456 --> 01:21:31.195
Angela seems to be taking it badly.

01:21:33.424 --> 01:21:36.427
If things get tough,
will you look after her?

01:21:36.428 --> 01:21:39.482
- Then I can take care of Frankie.
- Sure.

01:21:44.878 --> 01:21:47.419
That's it. Let's go.

01:22:22.165 --> 01:22:24.166
Listen.

01:22:24.167 --> 01:22:26.583
It's coming from the meadow.

01:22:28.372 --> 01:22:31.393
Come on. We must keep going.

01:22:47.877 --> 01:22:51.376
- Jeff!
- I'll get her. Take this.

01:23:49.153 --> 01:23:51.410
Lightning.

01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:56.212
Foster!

01:24:00.327 --> 01:24:02.983
Foster, get out of there!

01:24:08.017 --> 01:24:10.238
Foster!

01:24:40.097 --> 01:24:42.619
You fool. You could've
run into them!

01:24:42.620 --> 01:24:45.081
Let me go. Let me go!

01:24:45.464 --> 01:24:48.947
- Leave me alone. Let me go.
- You'll do as I say.

01:24:48.948 --> 01:24:52.367
In there. It'll be safe. Come on.

01:25:16.463 --> 01:25:18.825
You little idiot.

01:25:18.826 --> 01:25:22.389
Who are you to tell me
what to do? It's my life.

01:25:22.390 --> 01:25:24.431
You wouldn't stand a
chance on your own.

01:25:24.432 --> 01:25:26.394
At least we have a chance
by sticking together.

01:25:26.395 --> 01:25:29.597
I didn't ask you to come
after me. Go back.

01:25:29.598 --> 01:25:33.884
And leave you here? Oh, no.
Like it or not, I'm staying.

01:25:33.885 --> 01:25:36.927
I hate you. Leave me alone.

01:25:36.928 --> 01:25:41.012
Look, I'm just as
scared as you are.

01:25:41.013 --> 01:25:44.955
But... Well, we mustn't give up.

01:25:45.338 --> 01:25:48.676
We'll find a way. I know we will.

01:26:11.672 --> 01:26:15.888
- How many more flares?
- They're the last.

01:26:16.638 --> 01:26:20.535
Whatever happens,
Frankie, stay close.

01:26:25.689 --> 01:26:29.061
Callum. The storm, the storm.

01:26:35.062 --> 01:26:38.465
Hanson, run for it! Run!

01:26:38.466 --> 01:26:40.483
Run!

01:26:43.271 --> 01:26:45.972
Aaah!

01:27:40.583 --> 01:27:44.226
It's no good. Hanson
tried to warn us.

01:27:44.227 --> 01:27:46.803
They're all around us.

01:27:46.991 --> 01:27:49.246
It's the lightning.

01:28:03.772 --> 01:28:09.069
- I can't stand it. I can't...
- Stop it! Stop it!

01:28:17.469 --> 01:28:21.730
I don't want to kill you, but I
will if I have to. Don't stop me.

01:28:21.915 --> 01:28:25.678
- You little fool.
- No, you're the fool.

01:28:25.679 --> 01:28:28.842
I'd rather die like this
than be burnt alive.

01:28:28.843 --> 01:28:32.866
All right. Go on. Do
it, but kill me first.

01:28:33.810 --> 01:28:35.371
You?

01:28:35.372 --> 01:28:39.376
Yes. You're right. It's
hopeless, completely hopeless.

01:28:39.377 --> 01:28:42.589
So for once, do something
for someone else.

01:28:43.862 --> 01:28:46.084
Go on, shoot.

01:28:46.585 --> 01:28:48.716
Damn you.

01:28:54.996 --> 01:28:56.998
What is it with you?

01:28:56.999 --> 01:29:02.057
Don't you think I'm old enough
to take care of myself?

01:29:35.887 --> 01:29:38.428
Look. The rain.

01:29:38.811 --> 01:29:41.272
It's killing them.
