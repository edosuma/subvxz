WEBVTT

00:11.359 --> 00:13.230
Come on. You know
that's cheating.

00:13.273 --> 00:15.231
Excuse me. That's how
you play the game.

00:15.275 --> 00:17.800
Technically, but the
point of the game is

00:17.843 --> 00:19.236
to come up with
challenging words.

00:19.280 --> 00:21.934
No, the point of the game
is to win, and I did.

00:21.978 --> 00:23.762
Ugh. Okay, rematch.

00:23.806 --> 00:24.850
That wasyour rematch.

00:24.893 --> 00:26.112
Best of five?

00:26.155 --> 00:27.114
[sighs]
You're a sore loser.

00:27.157 --> 00:29.071
No, you're a chicken.What?

00:31.987 --> 00:33.076
Not happy to see me?

00:33.119 --> 00:35.209
I'm always happy
to see you.

00:35.252 --> 00:37.253
He hates why we're seeing you.

00:37.298 --> 00:40.953
Patrol sergeant on the
scene is always bad news.

00:40.996 --> 00:43.130
Well, welcome to 2-9.

00:43.173 --> 00:44.652
What do we got?

00:44.695 --> 00:46.002
Victim's name
is Reggie Williams.

00:46.045 --> 00:47.307
Shot right
in the head.

00:47.350 --> 00:48.612
Execution style?

00:48.656 --> 00:50.789
Yeah. He was scheduled
to testify against

00:50.832 --> 00:53.182
John Marconi this week,
drug lord who rules these parts.

00:53.226 --> 00:54.314
That's about the sixth witness

00:54.357 --> 00:55.750
who's been murdered
this year alone.

00:55.793 --> 00:57.100
I don't know what
these politicians were thinking

00:57.143 --> 00:58.710
when they changed the law.

01:00.015 --> 01:02.061
Anybody with half
a brain knows

01:02.104 --> 01:04.715
you never let the bad guy know
who's testifying against them.

01:04.760 --> 01:06.543
Well, technically,
the prosecutors are required

01:06.587 --> 01:08.545
to inform the defense attorneys,
not the bad guys.

01:08.590 --> 01:10.896
Yeah, well, unfortunately,
defense attorneys

01:10.939 --> 01:13.289
don't always keep privileged
information privileged.

01:13.334 --> 01:15.162
And this time
he paid the price.

01:16.510 --> 01:17.902
[inhales sharply]

01:19.948 --> 01:21.254
No, he has to come today.

01:21.298 --> 01:23.126
Mommy. Mommy.Sorry. Just checking.

01:23.170 --> 01:24.344
One second. Hi.Mommy.Sorry, you said you wanted

01:24.388 --> 01:25.650
the egg salad?Baby, wait, okay?

01:25.694 --> 01:27.043
You wanted
the egg salad sandwich?Mommy.

01:27.087 --> 01:28.218
No, no, no,
the turkey club, please.Mommy.

01:28.262 --> 01:30.176
The turkey club. Got it.Mommy.

01:30.219 --> 01:31.265
No, tomorrow will not work.Mommy.

01:31.307 --> 01:32.831
Baby, wait five minutes, okay?

01:32.875 --> 01:33.831
And you want ketchup

01:33.876 --> 01:35.224
and mayo on there?
Is that okay?

01:35.269 --> 01:37.009
WOMAN:No. No ketchup, no mayo.No ketchup, no mayo.

01:37.052 --> 01:38.793
WOMAN:No ketchup, no mayo.And you wanted the...

01:38.837 --> 01:41.057
WOMAN:No, tomorrow is
not gonna work!

01:41.100 --> 01:42.362
Just-- I'm sorry.
Hold on. What?

01:42.406 --> 01:43.929
You wanted the large
side of fries, correct?

01:43.972 --> 01:45.147
WOMAN:No, small, please.
Small fries.

01:45.192 --> 01:47.411
CLERK:Sorry.It's okay.

01:47.454 --> 01:49.152
And do you want
mayo instead?No, no may...

01:49.195 --> 01:51.022
No, no mayo.No ketchup,
no mayo. Got it.

01:51.067 --> 01:53.200
Okay, well, he has to come.
Please don't put me on hold.

01:53.242 --> 01:56.072
I... Ugh!Is there anything else
I can get for you?

01:56.115 --> 01:58.073
WOMAN:
No. Um, uh...

01:58.117 --> 02:00.031
CLERK:
Pack of gum? Apple juice?

02:00.075 --> 02:02.469
No, lemonade, please.Lemonade.

02:02.513 --> 02:05.168
Now, is there anything
else I can get for you?Jenny?

02:05.212 --> 02:06.734
Jenny, where are you?[engine starts]

02:06.778 --> 02:08.780
[gasps]

02:08.824 --> 02:10.433
[tires squealing]

02:10.478 --> 02:13.133
[gasps]
Jenny!

02:14.656 --> 02:16.223
Jenny!

02:29.365 --> 02:32.543
What are you doing?
Don't pause it now.

02:33.805 --> 02:36.111
He's an off-duty cop.

02:36.156 --> 02:38.200
Now watch this.

02:52.781 --> 02:55.043
You recognize him, boss?

02:57.437 --> 02:58.829
I'm not sure.

02:58.873 --> 03:01.354
He's that kid

03:01.397 --> 03:02.877
from Firearms
that you had me look into.

03:02.920 --> 03:04.487
Oh, yeah.

03:04.532 --> 03:07.012
[laughing]:You sure can pick 'em.
I mean, what are the odds?

03:07.056 --> 03:09.537
What's his name?

03:10.799 --> 03:12.669
I'm not sure.

03:12.713 --> 03:14.716
Detective Joe Hill.

03:14.759 --> 03:19.634
No, his name is
Hero Cop Joe Hill.

03:19.676 --> 03:22.941
He's gonna be the new
poster boy for the NYPD.

03:22.985 --> 03:24.900
A hero will rise.

03:24.943 --> 03:26.293
Couldn't come
at a better time.

03:26.336 --> 03:27.555
I'm gonna roll
this out like

03:27.598 --> 03:29.774
a big new action movie
starring Tom Cruise,

03:29.818 --> 03:31.253
and he's our Tom Cruise.

03:31.298 --> 03:32.995
I'm not so sure about that.

03:33.038 --> 03:35.780
Then it's a good thing
it's me and not you

03:35.824 --> 03:37.173
who's the deputy commissioner
of public information.

03:37.216 --> 03:40.263
His record is squeaky clean,
he checks all the boxes.

03:40.307 --> 03:42.177
There's literally
zero downside

03:42.222 --> 03:44.658
to making this kid
the face of the NYPD.

03:44.701 --> 03:48.314
Unless you count the black eye
and the missing teeth

03:48.358 --> 03:51.926
that end up being drawn on
every poster in every precinct.

03:51.969 --> 03:54.276
Small price to pay

03:54.320 --> 03:57.366
for the best PR this
department's had in a long time.

03:57.411 --> 04:00.587
Depends on the one
who's paying it.

04:01.849 --> 04:03.807
Need to prep him
for his 2:00.

04:03.852 --> 04:05.635
We can pick this up later.

04:11.902 --> 04:13.687
Frank?

04:14.949 --> 04:16.733
I'll think about it.

04:36.884 --> 04:38.408
I think you need to
talk to your grandson.

04:40.670 --> 04:43.326
I know that.

04:43.370 --> 04:47.024
Because if what they want
to make happen happens,

04:47.069 --> 04:48.939
the whole world
is gonna know it.

04:51.202 --> 04:52.987
I know that, too.

04:56.382 --> 04:58.514
Where is she?

04:58.558 --> 05:00.516
I said, where is she?Oh, um, I...

05:00.560 --> 05:02.519
Great.

05:03.694 --> 05:06.435
She's busy.

05:06.480 --> 05:08.394
Not for me, she's not.

05:08.437 --> 05:10.134
Stay the hell out
of this, Abetmarcus.

05:10.178 --> 05:12.268
It's "Abetemarco."Whatever.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.922
It's okay, Anthony.

05:13.964 --> 05:15.923
You wanted to see me?

05:15.966 --> 05:17.055
How could you?

05:17.098 --> 05:18.317
Well, you'd be surprised

05:18.360 --> 05:19.536
on how easy it was, actually.

05:19.579 --> 05:21.276
You know
when you prosecute a case

05:21.321 --> 05:22.713
but you walk away
with mixed feelings?

05:22.757 --> 05:24.235
Mm.Yeah, none of that.

05:24.279 --> 05:25.759
Not even a little.

05:25.802 --> 05:27.935
You betrayed this office
and everyone in it.

05:27.978 --> 05:31.374
All lies. Another
overreaching prosecutor.

05:31.418 --> 05:33.420
All true. Another
corrupt politician.

05:33.463 --> 05:35.159
Oh, you miscalculated.

05:35.204 --> 05:38.250
You showed your hand
way too early.

05:38.293 --> 05:39.512
This isn't even halftime.

05:39.555 --> 05:42.471
Actually, it's game over.

05:42.516 --> 05:45.213
Sir? Sir, you're under arrest.

05:45.257 --> 05:47.564
Put your hands
behind your back.

05:48.870 --> 05:52.221
You think this is over?
This is not over.

05:52.264 --> 05:54.483
You think this is over?!

05:58.966 --> 06:02.057
♪

06:22.468 --> 06:24.384
WOMAN:
I begged him not to testify.

06:25.906 --> 06:27.865
I told him how dangerous

06:27.908 --> 06:29.345
Marconi was.

06:29.389 --> 06:30.954
We know how hard
this is for you.

06:30.999 --> 06:32.521
How did they find out

06:32.566 --> 06:35.350
my Reggie was gonna take
a stand against Marconi?

06:35.394 --> 06:36.699
There's a new law.

06:36.744 --> 06:37.918
A stupidnew law.

06:37.961 --> 06:39.485
BAEZ:
It says the prosecution

06:39.528 --> 06:41.182
has to tell the defense
the names

06:41.225 --> 06:42.966
of those testifying against.

06:43.011 --> 06:45.579
We think Marconi's lawyer gave
your husband's name up.

06:48.146 --> 06:49.930
[voice breaking]:
We had a fight last night.

06:51.497 --> 06:54.196
And this morning,

06:54.238 --> 06:56.415
I could feel him

06:56.459 --> 06:59.723
standing behind me
while I was at the sink.

07:01.028 --> 07:02.899
He was trying to say goodbye.
[inhales sharply]

07:04.293 --> 07:06.382
Trying to make up.

07:08.601 --> 07:11.081
I pretended
I didn't even know he was there.

07:11.125 --> 07:14.564
Listen to me.
Where he is now,

07:14.608 --> 07:16.783
he knows exactly
how much you love him.

07:16.826 --> 07:21.004
I can be so small sometimes,

07:21.048 --> 07:23.529
so petty,
but not Reggie.

07:23.572 --> 07:28.230
Mm. He was so much bigger
than me in every way.

07:28.273 --> 07:30.536
Stand in the face of danger
and still do the right thing--

07:30.579 --> 07:33.452
that's more than big.
That's huge.

07:33.495 --> 07:35.497
Your dad was a hero, you know.

07:35.542 --> 07:37.673
Then why is he dead?

07:38.980 --> 07:43.026
Because God needed
Daddy's help up in heaven.

07:43.071 --> 07:47.031
But I need him here.

07:47.074 --> 07:48.946
I know you do.

07:48.990 --> 07:50.904
I do, too.

07:50.947 --> 07:53.516
Then make him come back.

07:56.475 --> 07:58.433
[clears throat]

08:00.697 --> 08:04.091
Um, you know...

08:04.134 --> 08:07.095
I think your daddy is here
with all of us right now.

08:08.312 --> 08:10.314
In fact, I think I can see him.

08:10.358 --> 08:12.055
You know where?

08:13.317 --> 08:17.365
Right there
inside your heart.

08:17.408 --> 08:19.499
Can you feel him?

08:22.110 --> 08:25.548
I want you to tell your dad
something for us, okay?

08:25.591 --> 08:26.593
Would you do that?

08:28.377 --> 08:30.292
I want you to tell your dad

08:30.334 --> 08:32.120
that we're gonna find
the people who did this,

08:32.163 --> 08:34.644
and they're gonna pay.

08:34.687 --> 08:36.515
And that's a promise.

08:38.299 --> 08:40.084
Okay?Okay.

08:45.350 --> 08:46.700
This isn't even halftime.

08:46.743 --> 08:49.049
Actually, it's game over.Actually, it's game over.

08:49.092 --> 08:50.312
Oh, will you knock it off?

08:50.355 --> 08:52.532
[chuckles]
Oh, please. You love it.

08:52.575 --> 08:53.836
Probably practiced that line

08:53.880 --> 08:55.490
in front of the mirror
for a week.

08:55.534 --> 08:57.537
Actually...Uh.

08:57.580 --> 08:59.581
Where'd you get
that, anyway?

08:59.625 --> 09:01.409
Horowitz in Sex Crimes, uh,

09:01.452 --> 09:02.759
filmed the whole thingon his phone.

09:02.802 --> 09:04.804
He texted it to me.I forwarded to you.

09:04.847 --> 09:06.850
Uh, no, that's okay.

09:06.894 --> 09:07.721
Yeah, right.
Like you're not gonna watch it

09:07.764 --> 09:08.851
on a loop all night.

09:08.895 --> 09:11.115
Uh, no, I won't.Yeah, well, one day,

09:11.158 --> 09:13.335
you can play itfor your grandkids

09:13.378 --> 09:16.467
and show them what a tough broadyou were back in the day.

09:16.511 --> 09:18.166
Well, hopefully "tough broad"
will be stricken

09:18.208 --> 09:20.254
from the lexicon by then.

09:20.298 --> 09:21.995
And if it's not,
you can make it so.

09:22.038 --> 09:24.432
As the new Manhattan
district attorney.

09:24.475 --> 09:27.087
I am not the new
district attorney.

09:27.130 --> 09:29.003
Yet.
No. Shh. Don't. Don't.

09:29.046 --> 09:30.570
What, jinx it?

09:30.613 --> 09:33.094
Come on, Erin.
You're a slam dunk.

09:35.575 --> 09:38.707
Excuse me. Please
stop! Ex-Excuse me!

09:38.751 --> 09:40.754
We just needto speak to him for a second.

09:40.797 --> 09:42.798
Afternoon, Counselor.

09:42.842 --> 09:44.278
ASSISTANT:
Mr. Raby,

09:44.322 --> 09:45.715
I tried to stop them.

09:45.759 --> 09:48.543
Them who?Detective Reagan
and Baez.

09:48.587 --> 09:50.980
Hmm. Not a pleasure. Please go.

09:51.024 --> 09:52.113
No can do.

09:52.155 --> 09:53.897
You got a court order,

09:53.941 --> 09:54.985
or is this just
straight-up harassment?

09:55.028 --> 09:57.030
No, actually.We just have a problem.

09:57.073 --> 09:59.510
Don't we all? Get security.

09:59.554 --> 10:01.600
There is no need
for any of that.

10:01.644 --> 10:02.731
We just have a few questions.

10:02.775 --> 10:04.211
Starting with this one.

10:04.254 --> 10:06.214
Is that your family
there in that picture,

10:06.256 --> 10:09.739
Mr. Rabys? 'Cause, see,
that's the crux of our problem.

10:09.783 --> 10:12.307
You get to go home
to your children tonight,

10:12.350 --> 10:14.657
but Reggie Williams doesn't get
to go home to his daughter.

10:14.701 --> 10:17.051
Last warning.
You need to leave now.

10:17.094 --> 10:19.706
Your client, John Marconi,
shot a man dead.

10:19.749 --> 10:21.446
Execution style.

10:21.490 --> 10:23.317
I don't know anything
about that.Yeah, you do.

10:23.360 --> 10:26.451
You gave the name of a witness
testifying against Marconi,

10:26.495 --> 10:28.671
and now that witness is dead,

10:28.715 --> 10:31.500
and his daughter
no longer has a father.

10:31.543 --> 10:33.067
What the hell is going on here?

10:33.110 --> 10:34.850
Please get them out
of here, Mr. Goggins.

10:34.894 --> 10:36.940
Nice and easythere, Goggins.

10:36.984 --> 10:39.072
We're all good.
I'm retired NYPD.

10:39.115 --> 10:42.510
Then what the hell you doingworking for this clown?

10:42.553 --> 10:44.381
I'm head of security for
Barnes, Raby, Associates, yes.

10:44.426 --> 10:46.907
And this is their
private property, so,

10:46.950 --> 10:48.517
how about we call it a day,
Detective?

10:52.739 --> 10:54.827
Look, I learned a long time ago
never make a promise

10:54.870 --> 10:56.917
to a victim's family 'cause you
never know if you can keep it.

10:56.960 --> 10:59.179
And I maybe shouldn't have
promised anything

10:59.222 --> 11:01.008
to this little girl,

11:01.051 --> 11:04.402
but you can be damn sure
I'm gonna keep my word to her.

11:07.187 --> 11:09.102
He's here.

11:11.714 --> 11:14.456
Good. Let's have him.

11:17.327 --> 11:18.764
Now,

11:18.807 --> 11:20.070
you don't have to do
any of that stuff.

11:20.114 --> 11:21.724
Just take a load off.

11:29.297 --> 11:31.778
[taps desk]

11:31.821 --> 11:35.085
So...
[chuckles]

11:35.129 --> 11:37.522
How you doing, Joe?

11:37.566 --> 11:39.610
Just another day at the office.

11:40.830 --> 11:42.397
Some people go to the gym

11:42.440 --> 11:44.312
and complain
about being sore all day.

11:44.355 --> 11:46.356
Others go to get sore.

11:46.400 --> 11:50.753
I'm not a masochist
if that's what you're saying.

11:50.797 --> 11:53.755
You're uncommon.
That's all I'm saying.

11:53.799 --> 11:56.323
Anyone would have done
what I did.

11:56.366 --> 11:58.413
You know a lot of guys

11:58.456 --> 12:01.024
who'd jump in front
of a speeding van, do you?

12:01.067 --> 12:03.809
Believe me, if I'd hada half second to think about it,

12:03.852 --> 12:06.159
I probably would have
chickened out.

12:06.202 --> 12:09.032
You know, there is
absolutely nothing in your file

12:09.076 --> 12:11.381
that would support that claim.

12:11.426 --> 12:14.341
It happened. I reacted.
Nothing more than that.

12:14.384 --> 12:17.605
Yeah. Is that what young people
call humblebragging?

12:18.606 --> 12:21.436
I know my truth, sir.

12:21.479 --> 12:24.177
Hmm. Okay.

12:24.221 --> 12:25.657
To business.

12:27.485 --> 12:29.792
Some people in my office

12:29.836 --> 12:33.753
want you to become
the poster boy for the NYPD.

12:35.754 --> 12:38.539
Which would come with what?

12:38.582 --> 12:43.023
Well, think of, uh, Tom Cruise

12:43.066 --> 12:45.981
the month beforeone of his big movies comes out.

12:46.025 --> 12:47.504
His face is everywhere.

12:47.548 --> 12:49.812
He has to tell the same story
over and over again

12:49.855 --> 12:52.336
and make it sound like it's
the first time he ever said it.

12:52.379 --> 12:54.947
Hmm.
Stuff like that.

12:57.211 --> 12:59.865
But he gets to be Tom Cruise.

13:02.129 --> 13:04.347
So you're interested.

13:07.437 --> 13:11.051
[exhales]
The NYPD's Top Gun?

13:11.094 --> 13:13.269
[clicks tongue]

13:13.313 --> 13:15.054
[chuckles]

13:17.274 --> 13:20.581
Something else
it might come with...

13:20.625 --> 13:23.802
The truth may come out.

13:27.676 --> 13:29.460
That you're my grandfather.

13:34.248 --> 13:36.032
That I'm your grandfather.

13:38.077 --> 13:42.168
And you're related by blood
to generations of NYPD.

13:44.432 --> 13:46.869
In those blockbuster franchises,

13:46.913 --> 13:49.480
they call that
your origin story.Hmm.

13:49.524 --> 13:50.654
What it is in your past

13:50.698 --> 13:54.745
that determines your destiny.

13:58.315 --> 13:59.707
Yeah.

14:01.753 --> 14:04.104
Not something you can take back.

14:11.633 --> 14:13.852
Why would I want to?

14:14.809 --> 14:16.855
[sighs]

14:23.340 --> 14:26.342
She in there?Uh, I'm sorry. No.

14:26.386 --> 14:27.909
No, she's not in there?

14:27.953 --> 14:30.086
Well, she is, but she's busy.

14:30.129 --> 14:31.566
Well, I'm her brother,

14:31.609 --> 14:33.350
and I'm sure
she's gonna want to see me.

14:33.394 --> 14:36.614
I'm so sorry, but she told me
absolutely nobody.

14:36.658 --> 14:38.921
Well, I'm not nobody, so...

14:38.965 --> 14:41.270
Look, you're right.

14:41.315 --> 14:45.144
And honestly,
you're totally scary,

14:45.187 --> 14:46.798
so I want to do
what you say,

14:46.841 --> 14:49.149
but she's totally
scary, too.

14:49.192 --> 14:51.542
And maybe it's a family thing.
I don't know. I'm not judging.

14:51.586 --> 14:53.109
Uh, all I know is, right now

14:53.153 --> 14:55.937
I literally have no idea
what to do, so...

15:10.125 --> 15:11.822
Hey.

15:11.866 --> 15:13.346
You lost weight.

15:13.389 --> 15:15.436
And you grew some hair.

15:15.479 --> 15:18.134
[exhales]
I, uh, came for a warrant.

15:18.177 --> 15:19.657
She's busy.

15:19.701 --> 15:20.962
Now I don't feel so bad.

15:21.006 --> 15:22.965
I got the Heisman myself
earlier today.

15:23.009 --> 15:23.879
Guess we're gonna
have to get used

15:23.923 --> 15:25.359
to her being the top dog, huh?

15:25.402 --> 15:27.230
No more rubber stamp

15:27.274 --> 15:28.971
for the great
Detective Danny Reagan.

15:29.014 --> 15:32.061
Well, technically, I do have
an in with my baby sis.

15:32.105 --> 15:34.455
Family Sunday dinner.
Every week.

15:34.498 --> 15:35.934
Good.

15:35.977 --> 15:37.719
So you can wait five days.

15:39.721 --> 15:41.984
Um...

15:42.028 --> 15:44.334
Cowboys, Giants?

15:45.945 --> 15:49.034
Sunday? I got a guy
if you're interested.

15:50.731 --> 15:52.515
Why don't we bring you upstairs,

15:52.559 --> 15:54.562
see if we can't cut through
some of that red tape for you.

15:54.605 --> 15:56.738
Yeah, there you go. Hell,
this could even be the start

15:56.780 --> 15:58.000
of a beautiful new friendship.

15:58.043 --> 16:00.176
Nah, I don't think so.

16:06.052 --> 16:07.400
Hello.

16:07.443 --> 16:08.923
The mother.

16:08.967 --> 16:11.274
Uh, Detective Reagan and Baez.

16:11.317 --> 16:12.884
Is this the residence
of John Marconi?

16:12.927 --> 16:14.495
I got it, Ma.Well...

16:14.538 --> 16:16.583
Take your tea.

16:18.542 --> 16:20.240
Help you?

16:20.283 --> 16:22.590
Yeah. You can take
a few steps out of our way.

16:22.633 --> 16:24.852
Search warrant. Move.

16:26.419 --> 16:28.812
All right, let's go.
We're looking in, under

16:28.856 --> 16:30.990
and behind everything. Move out.

16:58.147 --> 17:00.628
Danny.

17:00.671 --> 17:02.977
Why don't you
check Ma's room.

17:04.893 --> 17:06.328
You're wasting your time.

17:06.373 --> 17:08.027
Keep your mouth shut
and watch the game.

17:09.375 --> 17:10.942
["Largo al factotum" from
The Barber of Sevilleplaying]

17:13.423 --> 17:15.337
Think you're cute?

17:15.382 --> 17:17.905
That piece of paper don't
make this your house, Detective.

17:17.949 --> 17:20.517
I'm gonna do what I'm gonna do
in my home.

17:20.560 --> 17:22.519
That is, unless I think
you're interfering

17:22.563 --> 17:23.912
with a police investigation.

17:23.954 --> 17:25.434
Are you about finished?

17:25.479 --> 17:27.698
I got my masseuse coming in ten.

17:27.741 --> 17:30.440
We'll see how funny it is
when I slap 20 years on you.

17:30.483 --> 17:33.182
Nobody's got the stones to
testify against me. You know it

17:33.226 --> 17:34.227
and I know it.

17:34.269 --> 17:35.750
We'll see.

17:38.144 --> 17:39.666
All right.

17:40.884 --> 17:43.365
All right. We're
done. Let's move.

17:53.810 --> 17:55.116
You hear that?

17:55.161 --> 17:56.249
Hear what?

17:56.291 --> 17:58.337
Fat lady singing.

18:02.342 --> 18:04.344
BAEZ:
He's right, you know.

18:04.386 --> 18:06.911
There's no way anyone'sgonna say one word against him.[sighs]

18:06.954 --> 18:08.695
He's got this whole place
on lockdown.

18:08.739 --> 18:10.088
Got about a dozen
kids up there

18:10.132 --> 18:11.960
horsing around at
this time of night.

18:12.002 --> 18:13.614
That's what happens around here.

18:13.656 --> 18:16.007
Hard to enforce bedtime when
the parents are out partying.

18:16.050 --> 18:17.487
It's like
a random Tuesday night,

18:17.530 --> 18:19.054
and they're in there
having a block party.

18:21.273 --> 18:23.840
What's with
Little Lord Fauntleroy?

18:23.884 --> 18:25.407
JAMIE:
That's Marconi's kid.

18:25.451 --> 18:27.453
Honor roll at
Parker Mac Prep.

18:27.497 --> 18:29.064
Is he part
of the family business?No.

18:29.107 --> 18:30.457
He's supposed to take
the whole thing legit one day.

18:30.500 --> 18:31.632
What's his name?

18:31.674 --> 18:32.980
Futuro.

18:33.023 --> 18:33.938
The future.

18:35.548 --> 18:38.421
Well, maybe the future holds
the key to our salvation, then.

18:38.464 --> 18:39.552
What do you got in mind?

18:39.596 --> 18:40.989
When's the last time

18:41.031 --> 18:42.990
your cops made
some good overtime?

18:43.034 --> 18:44.601
Hey.

18:44.644 --> 18:46.516
[whispers]:
Shh. Close the door.

18:46.559 --> 18:48.170
I'm hiding.

18:48.213 --> 18:49.911
From?

18:49.953 --> 18:51.130
The Think Police.

18:51.173 --> 18:53.348
It's Thought Police.What?

18:53.393 --> 18:54.959
Orwell's 1984.

18:55.002 --> 18:56.917
It's Thought Police,
not Think Police.

18:56.961 --> 18:59.137
Okay, well, the governor's
people are in my office,

18:59.181 --> 19:00.964
giving my entire life
a colonoscopy,

19:01.009 --> 19:02.618
and I need a break.It's a waste

19:02.663 --> 19:04.403
of time. It's not like
they're not gonna pick you.

19:04.446 --> 19:06.797
Apparently,
there's someone else in the mix.

19:06.840 --> 19:08.103
Get out of here. Who?

19:09.712 --> 19:11.846
You don't know anything
about him?Just that

19:11.888 --> 19:13.542
whoever it is,
a little birdie told me

19:13.586 --> 19:15.632
that they came out
squeaky-clean.

19:15.675 --> 19:18.068
Eh, probably just a formality

19:18.113 --> 19:21.115
to demonstrate they considered
other candidates.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.727
Doesn't feel like a formality.

19:23.770 --> 19:25.685
You got nothing to worry about.

19:25.729 --> 19:27.730
Even if this guy is Mr. Clean,

19:27.775 --> 19:29.558
you're still
Miss Goody Two-shoes.

19:29.603 --> 19:31.125
I am not.Oh, that's right.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.214
There was that time
you went jaywalking.

19:33.259 --> 19:36.609
In my day, I was the wild one.
A rebel, even.

19:36.653 --> 19:37.872
Uh-huh.

19:37.914 --> 19:39.787
I am not Miss Goody Two-shoes.

19:39.829 --> 19:42.572
No, but you're Miss Future
Acting District Attorney,

19:42.615 --> 19:44.922
so they have to vet you.
It's no biggie.

19:44.965 --> 19:48.098
Okay, you're not listening,
so could you just leave?

19:48.143 --> 19:50.537
Yeah, well, there's one problem.
This is my office.

19:52.538 --> 19:53.844
Fine.

19:58.371 --> 20:00.415
[door opens]

20:01.982 --> 20:04.420
Sorry to interrupt,
but you have a visitor.

20:04.463 --> 20:07.770
[sighs] What,
we taking walk-ins now?

20:07.815 --> 20:09.859
I got a call from downstairs.

20:09.903 --> 20:11.992
You need to take this meeting.

20:13.255 --> 20:14.647
I do?

20:14.691 --> 20:16.998
It's Paula Hill.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.740
Oh.

20:30.403 --> 20:32.230
Hi.

20:32.273 --> 20:34.842
Hi. I'm sorry
for showing up like this.

20:34.884 --> 20:37.410
I'm sure I'm breaking
all sorts of protocols.

20:37.452 --> 20:41.282
You're family.
Family gets a pass on protocol.

20:41.326 --> 20:43.111
Yeah, I'm not family.

20:44.416 --> 20:48.072
[chuckles]: Well, you're
the mother of my grandson.

20:48.115 --> 20:50.074
They may not have
a section for that

20:50.117 --> 20:51.423
in the greeting card aisle,
but...

20:51.467 --> 20:53.948
We're not your family.

20:54.949 --> 20:56.906
Okay.

20:56.951 --> 20:59.692
Yes, my son may be related
to you by blood, but I'm...

20:59.736 --> 21:02.130
Okay, I stand corrected.
I'm sorry.

21:02.173 --> 21:04.132
It's why I'm here.

21:04.174 --> 21:05.307
To correct me?

21:05.351 --> 21:07.482
I want him to stay Joe Hill.

21:07.527 --> 21:09.049
He isJoe Hill.Not if

21:09.093 --> 21:10.834
it gets out who his father is.

21:10.877 --> 21:12.705
Who his real family is.

21:12.749 --> 21:14.708
Youare his real family.

21:14.750 --> 21:16.797
Yeah, I always thought so.

21:16.839 --> 21:19.103
But things have changed.

21:19.146 --> 21:21.540
He's a hero cop
being paraded around.

21:21.584 --> 21:23.846
As Detective Joe Hill.

21:25.632 --> 21:28.461
Look, I-I...

21:28.503 --> 21:31.898
I don't understand
what you're getting at here.

21:34.554 --> 21:37.861
Are you gonna claim him
as one of yours?

21:39.863 --> 21:42.125
Oh, Paula.

21:42.170 --> 21:44.346
That's just not who we are.

21:44.390 --> 21:46.347
Well, he's all I have.

21:46.392 --> 21:48.785
And he's a Hill

21:48.828 --> 21:50.743
of the Warwick, Rhode Island
Hills,

21:50.787 --> 21:52.615
and that is important to us.

21:52.659 --> 21:54.313
Well, of course it is.

21:54.355 --> 21:55.617
I would never.

21:55.662 --> 21:58.490
Wewould never.

21:58.534 --> 22:02.407
And this is a conversation
between you and your son,

22:02.451 --> 22:03.409
not you and me.

22:03.451 --> 22:05.105
Yeah, it is.

22:05.148 --> 22:07.455
If you tell him
to keep it a secret, he will.

22:07.500 --> 22:08.848
But it's all up to him.

22:08.892 --> 22:10.851
Please don't deny me again.

22:10.894 --> 22:14.420
I can't deny you something

22:14.462 --> 22:17.553
that was never in my power
to withhold in the first place.

22:17.596 --> 22:19.381
You could talk to him.

22:19.424 --> 22:20.512
Please.

22:20.556 --> 22:22.165
And say what?

22:22.210 --> 22:24.298
Uh, "forget you ever met us"?

22:24.343 --> 22:26.866
Whatever it takes.

22:29.434 --> 22:30.913
[sighs]
