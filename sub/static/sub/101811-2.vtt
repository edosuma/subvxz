WEBVTT

00:11.359 --> 00:13.230
Come on. You know
that's cheating.

00:13.273 --> 00:15.231
Excuse me. That's how
you play the game.

00:15.275 --> 00:17.800
Technically, but the
point of the game is

00:17.843 --> 00:19.236
to come up with
challenging words.

00:19.280 --> 00:21.934
No, the point of the game
is to win, and I did.

00:21.978 --> 00:23.762
Ugh. Okay, rematch.

00:23.806 --> 00:24.850
That wasyour rematch.

00:24.893 --> 00:26.112
Best of five?

00:26.155 --> 00:27.114
[sighs]
You're a sore loser.

00:27.157 --> 00:29.071
No, you're a chicken.What?

00:31.987 --> 00:33.076
Not happy to see me?

00:33.119 --> 00:35.209
I'm always happy
to see you.

00:35.252 --> 00:37.253
He hates why we're seeing you.

00:37.298 --> 00:40.953
Patrol sergeant on the
scene is always bad news.

00:40.996 --> 00:43.130
Well, welcome to 2-9.

00:43.173 --> 00:44.652
What do we got?

00:44.695 --> 00:46.002
Victim's name
is Reggie Williams.

00:46.045 --> 00:47.307
Shot right
in the head.

00:47.350 --> 00:48.612
Execution style?

00:48.656 --> 00:50.789
Yeah. He was scheduled
to testify against

00:50.832 --> 00:53.182
John Marconi this week,
drug lord who rules these parts.

00:53.226 --> 00:54.314
That's about the sixth witness

00:54.357 --> 00:55.750
who's been murdered
this year alone.

00:55.793 --> 00:57.100
I don't know what
these politicians were thinking

00:57.143 --> 00:58.710
when they changed the law.

01:00.015 --> 01:02.061
Anybody with half
a brain knows

01:02.104 --> 01:04.715
you never let the bad guy know
who's testifying against them.

01:04.760 --> 01:06.543
Well, technically,
the prosecutors are required

01:06.587 --> 01:08.545
to inform the defense attorneys,
not the bad guys.

01:08.590 --> 01:10.896
Yeah, well, unfortunately,
defense attorneys

01:10.939 --> 01:13.289
don't always keep privileged
information privileged.

01:13.334 --> 01:15.162
And this time
he paid the price.

01:16.510 --> 01:17.902
[inhales sharply]

01:19.948 --> 01:21.254
No, he has to come today.

01:21.298 --> 01:23.126
Mommy. Mommy.Sorry. Just checking.

01:23.170 --> 01:24.344
One second. Hi.Mommy.Sorry, you said you wanted

01:24.388 --> 01:25.650
the egg salad?Baby, wait, okay?

01:25.694 --> 01:27.043
You wanted
the egg salad sandwich?Mommy.

01:27.087 --> 01:28.218
No, no, no,
the turkey club, please.Mommy.

01:28.262 --> 01:30.176
The turkey club. Got it.Mommy.

01:30.219 --> 01:31.265
No, tomorrow will not work.Mommy.

01:31.307 --> 01:32.831
Baby, wait five minutes, okay?

01:32.875 --> 01:33.831
And you want ketchup

01:33.876 --> 01:35.224
and mayo on there?
Is that okay?

01:35.269 --> 01:37.009
WOMAN:No. No ketchup, no mayo.No ketchup, no mayo.

01:37.052 --> 01:38.793
WOMAN:No ketchup, no mayo.And you wanted the...

01:38.837 --> 01:41.057
WOMAN:No, tomorrow is
not gonna work!

01:41.100 --> 01:42.362
Just-- I'm sorry.
Hold on. What?

01:42.406 --> 01:43.929
You wanted the large
side of fries, correct?

01:43.972 --> 01:45.147
WOMAN:No, small, please.
Small fries.

01:45.192 --> 01:47.411
CLERK:Sorry.It's okay.

01:47.454 --> 01:49.152
And do you want
mayo instead?No, no may...

01:49.195 --> 01:51.022
No, no mayo.No ketchup,
no mayo. Got it.

01:51.067 --> 01:53.200
Okay, well, he has to come.
Please don't put me on hold.

01:53.242 --> 01:56.072
I... Ugh!Is there anything else
I can get for you?

01:56.115 --> 01:58.073
WOMAN:
No. Um, uh...

01:58.117 --> 02:00.031
CLERK:
Pack of gum? Apple juice?

02:00.075 --> 02:02.469
No, lemonade, please.Lemonade.

02:02.513 --> 02:05.168
Now, is there anything
else I can get for you?Jenny?

02:05.212 --> 02:06.734
Jenny, where are you?[engine starts]

02:06.778 --> 02:08.780
[gasps]

02:08.824 --> 02:10.433
[tires squealing]

02:10.478 --> 02:13.133
[gasps]
Jenny!

02:14.656 --> 02:16.223
Jenny!

02:29.365 --> 02:32.543
What are you doing?
Don't pause it now.

02:33.805 --> 02:36.111
He's an off-duty cop.

02:36.156 --> 02:38.200
Now watch this.

02:52.781 --> 02:55.043
You recognize him, boss?

02:57.437 --> 02:58.829
I'm not sure.

02:58.873 --> 03:01.354
He's that kid

03:01.397 --> 03:02.877
from Firearms
that you had me look into.

03:02.920 --> 03:04.487
Oh, yeah.

03:04.532 --> 03:07.012
[laughing]:You sure can pick 'em.
I mean, what are the odds?

03:07.056 --> 03:09.537
What's his name?

03:10.799 --> 03:12.669
I'm not sure.

03:12.713 --> 03:14.716
Detective Joe Hill.

03:14.759 --> 03:19.634
No, his name is
Hero Cop Joe Hill.

03:19.676 --> 03:22.941
He's gonna be the new
poster boy for the NYPD.

03:22.985 --> 03:24.900
A hero will rise.

03:24.943 --> 03:26.293
Couldn't come
at a better time.

03:26.336 --> 03:27.555
I'm gonna roll
this out like

03:27.598 --> 03:29.774
a big new action movie
starring Tom Cruise,

03:29.818 --> 03:31.253
and he's our Tom Cruise.

03:31.298 --> 03:32.995
I'm not so sure about that.

03:33.038 --> 03:35.780
Then it's a good thing
it's me and not you

03:35.824 --> 03:37.173
who's the deputy commissioner
of public information.

03:37.216 --> 03:40.263
His record is squeaky clean,
he checks all the boxes.

03:40.307 --> 03:42.177
There's literally
zero downside

03:42.222 --> 03:44.658
to making this kid
the face of the NYPD.

03:44.701 --> 03:48.314
Unless you count the black eye
and the missing teeth

03:48.358 --> 03:51.926
that end up being drawn on
every poster in every precinct.

03:51.969 --> 03:54.276
Small price to pay

03:54.320 --> 03:57.366
for the best PR this
department's had in a long time.

03:57.411 --> 04:00.587
Depends on the one
who's paying it.

04:01.849 --> 04:03.807
Need to prep him
for his 2:00.

04:03.852 --> 04:05.635
We can pick this up later.

04:11.902 --> 04:13.687
Frank?

04:14.949 --> 04:16.733
I'll think about it.

04:36.884 --> 04:38.408
I think you need to
talk to your grandson.

04:40.670 --> 04:43.326
I know that.

04:43.370 --> 04:47.024
Because if what they want
to make happen happens,

04:47.069 --> 04:48.939
the whole world
is gonna know it.

04:51.202 --> 04:52.987
I know that, too.

04:56.382 --> 04:58.514
Where is she?

04:58.558 --> 05:00.516
I said, where is she?Oh, um, I...

05:00.560 --> 05:02.519
Great.

05:03.694 --> 05:06.435
She's busy.

05:06.480 --> 05:08.394
Not for me, she's not.

05:08.437 --> 05:10.134
Stay the hell out
of this, Abetmarcus.

05:10.178 --> 05:12.268
It's "Abetemarco."Whatever.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.922
It's okay, Anthony.

05:13.964 --> 05:15.923
You wanted to see me?

05:15.966 --> 05:17.055
How could you?

05:17.098 --> 05:18.317
Well, you'd be surprised

05:18.360 --> 05:19.536
on how easy it was, actually.

05:19.579 --> 05:21.276
You know
when you prosecute a case

05:21.321 --> 05:22.713
but you walk away
with mixed feelings?

05:22.757 --> 05:24.235
Mm.Yeah, none of that.

05:24.279 --> 05:25.759
Not even a little.

05:25.802 --> 05:27.935
You betrayed this office
and everyone in it.

05:27.978 --> 05:31.374
All lies. Another
overreaching prosecutor.

05:31.418 --> 05:33.420
All true. Another
corrupt politician.

05:33.463 --> 05:35.159
Oh, you miscalculated.

05:35.204 --> 05:38.250
You showed your hand
way too early.

05:38.293 --> 05:39.512
This isn't even halftime.

05:39.555 --> 05:42.471
Actually, it's game over.

05:42.516 --> 05:45.213
Sir? Sir, you're under arrest.

05:45.257 --> 05:47.564
Put your hands
behind your back.

05:48.870 --> 05:52.221
You think this is over?
This is not over.

05:52.264 --> 05:54.483
You think this is over?!

05:58.966 --> 06:02.057
â™ª

06:22.468 --> 06:24.384
WOMAN:
I begged him not to testify.

06:25.906 --> 06:27.865
I told him how dangerous

06:27.908 --> 06:29.345
Marconi was.

06:29.389 --> 06:30.954
We know how hard
this is for you.

06:30.999 --> 06:32.521
How did they find out

06:32.566 --> 06:35.350
my Reggie was gonna take
a stand against Marconi?

06:35.394 --> 06:36.699
There's a new law.

06:36.744 --> 06:37.918
A stupidnew law.

06:37.961 --> 06:39.485
BAEZ:
It says the prosecution

06:39.528 --> 06:41.182
has to tell the defense
the names

06:41.225 --> 06:42.966
of those testifying against.

06:43.011 --> 06:45.579
We think Marconi's lawyer gave
your husband's name up.

06:48.146 --> 06:49.930
[voice breaking]:
We had a fight last night.

06:51.497 --> 06:54.196
And this morning,

06:54.238 --> 06:56.415
I could feel him

06:56.459 --> 06:59.723
standing behind me
while I was at the sink.

07:01.028 --> 07:02.899
He was trying to say goodbye.
[inhales sharply]

07:04.293 --> 07:06.382
Trying to make up.

07:08.601 --> 07:11.081
I pretended
I didn't even know he was there.

07:11.125 --> 07:14.564
Listen to me.
Where he is now,

07:14.608 --> 07:16.783
he knows exactly
how much you love him.

07:16.826 --> 07:21.004
I can be so small sometimes,

07:21.048 --> 07:23.529
so petty,
but not Reggie.

07:23.572 --> 07:28.230
Mm. He was so much bigger
than me in every way.

07:28.273 --> 07:30.536
Stand in the face of danger
and still do the right thing--

07:30.579 --> 07:33.452
that's more than big.
That's huge.

07:33.495 --> 07:35.497
Your dad was a hero, you know.

07:35.542 --> 07:37.673
Then why is he dead?

07:38.980 --> 07:43.026
Because God needed
Daddy's help up in heaven.

07:43.071 --> 07:47.031
But I need him here.

07:47.074 --> 07:48.946
I know you do.

07:48.990 --> 07:50.904
I do, too.

07:50.947 --> 07:53.516
Then make him come back.

07:56.475 --> 07:58.433
[clears throat]

08:00.697 --> 08:04.091
Um, you know...

08:04.134 --> 08:07.095
I think your daddy is here
with all of us right now.

08:08.312 --> 08:10.314
In fact, I think I can see him.

08:10.358 --> 08:12.055
You know where?

08:13.317 --> 08:17.365
Right there
inside your heart.

08:17.408 --> 08:19.499
Can you feel him?

08:22.110 --> 08:25.548
I want you to tell your dad
something for us, okay?

08:25.591 --> 08:26.593
Would you do that?

08:28.377 --> 08:30.292
I want you to tell your dad

08:30.334 --> 08:32.120
that we're gonna find
the people who did this,

08:32.163 --> 08:34.644
and they're gonna pay.

08:34.687 --> 08:36.515
And that's a promise.

08:38.299 --> 08:40.084
Okay?Okay.

08:45.350 --> 08:46.700
This isn't even halftime.

08:46.743 --> 08:49.049
Actually, it's game over.Actually, it's game over.

08:49.092 --> 08:50.312
Oh, will you knock it off?

08:50.355 --> 08:52.532
[chuckles]
Oh, please. You love it.

08:52.575 --> 08:53.836
Probably practiced that line

08:53.880 --> 08:55.490
in front of the mirror
for a week.

08:55.534 --> 08:57.537
Actually...Uh.

08:57.580 --> 08:59.581
Where'd you get
that, anyway?

08:59.625 --> 09:01.409
Horowitz in Sex Crimes, uh,

09:01.452 --> 09:02.759
filmed the whole thingon his phone.

09:02.802 --> 09:04.804
He texted it to me.I forwarded to you.

09:04.847 --> 09:06.850
Uh, no, that's okay.

09:06.894 --> 09:07.721
Yeah, right.
Like you're not gonna watch it

09:07.764 --> 09:08.851
on a loop all night.

09:08.895 --> 09:11.115
Uh, no, I won't.Yeah, well, one day,

09:11.158 --> 09:13.335
you can play itfor your grandkids

09:13.378 --> 09:16.467
and show them what a tough broadyou were back in the day.

09:16.511 --> 09:18.166
Well, hopefully "tough broad"
will be stricken

09:18.208 --> 09:20.254
from the lexicon by then.

09:20.298 --> 09:21.995
And if it's not,
you can make it so.

09:22.038 --> 09:24.432
As the new Manhattan
district attorney.

09:24.475 --> 09:27.087
I am not the new
district attorney.

09:27.130 --> 09:29.003
Yet.
No. Shh. Don't. Don't.

09:29.046 --> 09:30.570
What, jinx it?

09:30.613 --> 09:33.094
Come on, Erin.
You're a slam dunk.

09:35.575 --> 09:38.707
Excuse me. Please
stop! Ex-Excuse me!

09:38.751 --> 09:40.754
We just needto speak to him for a second.

09:40.797 --> 09:42.798
Afternoon, Counselor.

09:42.842 --> 09:44.278
ASSISTANT:
Mr. Raby,

09:44.322 --> 09:45.715
I tried to stop them.

09:45.759 --> 09:48.543
Them who?Detective Reagan
and Baez.

09:48.587 --> 09:50.980
Hmm. Not a pleasure. Please go.

09:51.024 --> 09:52.113
No can do.

09:52.155 --> 09:53.897
You got a court order,

09:53.941 --> 09:54.985
or is this just
straight-up harassment?

09:55.028 --> 09:57.030
No, actually.We just have a problem.

09:57.073 --> 09:59.510
Don't we all? Get security.

09:59.554 --> 10:01.600
There is no need
for any of that.

10:01.644 --> 10:02.731
We just have a few questions.

10:02.775 --> 10:04.211
Starting with this one.

10:04.254 --> 10:06.214
Is that your family
there in that picture,

10:06.256 --> 10:09.739
Mr. Rabys? 'Cause, see,
that's the crux of our problem.

10:09.783 --> 10:12.307
You get to go home
to your children tonight,

10:12.350 --> 10:14.657
but Reggie Williams doesn't get
to go home to his daughter.

10:14.701 --> 10:17.051
Last warning.
You need to leave now.

10:17.094 --> 10:19.706
Your client, John Marconi,
shot a man dead.

10:19.749 --> 10:21.446
Execution style.

10:21.490 --> 10:23.317
I don't know anything
about that.Yeah, you do.

10:23.360 --> 10:26.451
You gave the name of a witness
testifying against Marconi,

10:26.495 --> 10:28.671
and now that witness is dead,

10:28.715 --> 10:31.500
and his daughter
no longer has a father.

10:31.543 --> 10:33.067
What the hell is going on here?

10:33.110 --> 10:34.850
Please get them out
of here, Mr. Goggins.

10:34.894 --> 10:36.940
Nice and easythere, Goggins.

10:36.984 --> 10:39.072
We're all good.
I'm retired NYPD.

10:39.115 --> 10:42.510
Then what the hell you doingworking for this clown?

10:42.553 --> 10:44.381
I'm head of security for
Barnes, Raby, Associates, yes.

10:44.426 --> 10:46.907
And this is their
private property, so,

10:46.950 --> 10:48.517
how about we call it a day,
Detective?

10:52.739 --> 10:54.827
Look, I learned a long time ago
never make a promise

10:54.870 --> 10:56.917
to a victim's family 'cause you
never know if you can keep it.

10:56.960 --> 10:59.179
And I maybe shouldn't have
promised anything

10:59.222 --> 11:01.008
to this little girl,

11:01.051 --> 11:04.402
but you can be damn sure
I'm gonna keep my word to her.

11:07.187 --> 11:09.102
He's here.

11:11.714 --> 11:14.456
Good. Let's have him.

11:17.327 --> 11:18.764
Now,

11:18.807 --> 11:20.070
you don't have to do
any of that stuff.

11:20.114 --> 11:21.724
Just take a load off.

11:29.297 --> 11:31.778
[taps desk]

11:31.821 --> 11:35.085
So...
[chuckles]

11:35.129 --> 11:37.522
How you doing, Joe?

11:37.566 --> 11:39.610
Just another day at the office.

11:40.830 --> 11:42.397
Some people go to the gym

11:42.440 --> 11:44.312
and complain
about being sore all day.

11:44.355 --> 11:46.356
Others go to get sore.

11:46.400 --> 11:50.753
I'm not a masochist
if that's what you're saying.

11:50.797 --> 11:53.755
You're uncommon.
That's all I'm saying.

11:53.799 --> 11:56.323
Anyone would have done
what I did.

11:56.366 --> 11:58.413
You know a lot of guys

11:58.456 --> 12:01.024
who'd jump in front
of a speeding van, do you?

12:01.067 --> 12:03.809
Believe me, if I'd hada half second to think about it,

12:03.852 --> 12:06.159
I probably would have
chickened out.

12:06.202 --> 12:09.032
You know, there is
absolutely nothing in your file

12:09.076 --> 12:11.381
that would support that claim.

12:11.426 --> 12:14.341
It happened. I reacted.
Nothing more than that.

12:14.384 --> 12:17.605
Yeah. Is that what young people
call humblebragging?

12:18.606 --> 12:21.436
I know my truth, sir.

12:21.479 --> 12:24.177
Hmm. Okay.

12:24.221 --> 12:25.657
To business.

12:27.485 --> 12:29.792
Some people in my office

12:29.836 --> 12:33.753
want you to become
the poster boy for the NYPD.

12:35.754 --> 12:38.539
Which would come with what?

12:38.582 --> 12:43.023
Well, think of, uh, Tom Cruise

12:43.066 --> 12:45.981
the month beforeone of his big movies comes out.

12:46.025 --> 12:47.504
His face is everywhere.

12:47.548 --> 12:49.812
He has to tell the same story
over and over again

12:49.855 --> 12:52.336
and make it sound like it's
the first time he ever said it.

12:52.379 --> 12:54.947
Hmm.
Stuff like that.

12:57.211 --> 12:59.865
But he gets to be Tom Cruise.

13:02.129 --> 13:04.347
So you're interested.

13:07.437 --> 13:11.051
[exhales]
The NYPD's Top Gun?

13:11.094 --> 13:13.269
[clicks tongue]

13:13.313 --> 13:15.054
[chuckles]

13:17.274 --> 13:20.581
Something else
it might come with...

13:20.625 --> 13:23.802
The truth may come out.

13:27.676 --> 13:29.460
That you're my grandfather.

13:34.248 --> 13:36.032
That I'm your grandfather.

13:38.077 --> 13:42.168
And you're related by blood
to generations of NYPD.

13:44.432 --> 13:46.869
In those blockbuster franchises,

13:46.913 --> 13:49.480
they call that
your origin story.Hmm.

13:49.524 --> 13:50.654
What it is in your past

13:50.698 --> 13:54.745
that determines your destiny.

13:58.315 --> 13:59.707
Yeah.

14:01.753 --> 14:04.104
Not something you can take back.

14:11.633 --> 14:13.852
Why would I want to?

14:14.809 --> 14:16.855
[sighs]

14:23.340 --> 14:26.342
She in there?Uh, I'm sorry. No.

14:26.386 --> 14:27.909
No, she's not in there?

14:27.953 --> 14:30.086
Well, she is, but she's busy.

14:30.129 --> 14:31.566
Well, I'm her brother,

14:31.609 --> 14:33.350
and I'm sure
she's gonna want to see me.

14:33.394 --> 14:36.614
I'm so sorry, but she told me
absolutely nobody.

14:36.658 --> 14:38.921
Well, I'm not nobody, so...

14:38.965 --> 14:41.270
Look, you're right.

14:41.315 --> 14:45.144
And honestly,
you're totally scary,

14:45.187 --> 14:46.798
so I want to do
what you say,

14:46.841 --> 14:49.149
but she's totally
scary, too.

14:49.192 --> 14:51.542
And maybe it's a family thing.
I don't know. I'm not judging.

14:51.586 --> 14:53.109
Uh, all I know is, right now

14:53.153 --> 14:55.937
I literally have no idea
what to do, so...

15:10.125 --> 15:11.822
Hey.

15:11.866 --> 15:13.346
You lost weight.

15:13.389 --> 15:15.436
And you grew some hair.

15:15.479 --> 15:18.134
[exhales]
I, uh, came for a warrant.

15:18.177 --> 15:19.657
She's busy.

15:19.701 --> 15:20.962
Now I don't feel so bad.

15:21.006 --> 15:22.965
I got the Heisman myself
earlier today.

15:23.009 --> 15:23.879
Guess we're gonna
have to get used

15:23.923 --> 15:25.359
to her being the top dog, huh?

15:25.402 --> 15:27.230
No more rubber stamp

15:27.274 --> 15:28.971
for the great
Detective Danny Reagan.

15:29.014 --> 15:32.061
Well, technically, I do have
an in with my baby sis.

15:32.105 --> 15:34.455
Family Sunday dinner.
Every week.

15:34.498 --> 15:35.934
Good.

15:35.977 --> 15:37.719
So you can wait five days.

15:39.721 --> 15:41.984
Um...

15:42.028 --> 15:44.334
Cowboys, Giants?

15:45.945 --> 15:49.034
Sunday? I got a guy
if you're interested.

15:50.731 --> 15:52.515
Why don't we bring you upstairs,

15:52.559 --> 15:54.562
see if we can't cut through
some of that red tape for you.

15:54.605 --> 15:56.738
Yeah, there you go. Hell,
this could even be the start

15:56.780 --> 15:58.000
of a beautiful new friendship.

15:58.043 --> 16:00.176
Nah, I don't think so.

16:06.052 --> 16:07.400
Hello.

16:07.443 --> 16:08.923
The mother.

16:08.967 --> 16:11.274
Uh, Detective Reagan and Baez.

16:11.317 --> 16:12.884
Is this the residence
of John Marconi?

16:12.927 --> 16:14.495
I got it, Ma.Well...

16:14.538 --> 16:16.583
Take your tea.

16:18.542 --> 16:20.240
Help you?

16:20.283 --> 16:22.590
Yeah. You can take
a few steps out of our way.

16:22.633 --> 16:24.852
Search warrant. Move.

16:26.419 --> 16:28.812
All right, let's go.
We're looking in, under

16:28.856 --> 16:30.990
and behind everything. Move out.

16:58.147 --> 17:00.628
Danny.

17:00.671 --> 17:02.977
Why don't you
check Ma's room.

17:04.893 --> 17:06.328
You're wasting your time.

17:06.373 --> 17:08.027
Keep your mouth shut
and watch the game.

17:09.375 --> 17:10.942
["Largo al factotum" from
The Barber of Sevilleplaying]

17:13.423 --> 17:15.337
Think you're cute?

17:15.382 --> 17:17.905
That piece of paper don't
make this your house, Detective.

17:17.949 --> 17:20.517
I'm gonna do what I'm gonna do
in my home.

17:20.560 --> 17:22.519
That is, unless I think
you're interfering

17:22.563 --> 17:23.912
with a police investigation.

17:23.954 --> 17:25.434
Are you about finished?

17:25.479 --> 17:27.698
I got my masseuse coming in ten.

17:27.741 --> 17:30.440
We'll see how funny it is
when I slap 20 years on you.

17:30.483 --> 17:33.182
Nobody's got the stones to
testify against me. You know it

17:33.226 --> 17:34.227
and I know it.

17:34.269 --> 17:35.750
We'll see.

17:38.144 --> 17:39.666
All right.

17:40.884 --> 17:43.365
All right. We're
done. Let's move.

17:53.810 --> 17:55.116
You hear that?

17:55.161 --> 17:56.249
Hear what?

17:56.291 --> 17:58.337
Fat lady singing.

18:02.342 --> 18:04.344
BAEZ:
He's right, you know.

18:04.386 --> 18:06.911
There's no way anyone'sgonna say one word against him.[sighs]

18:06.954 --> 18:08.695
He's got this whole place
on lockdown.

18:08.739 --> 18:10.088
Got about a dozen
kids up there

18:10.132 --> 18:11.960
horsing around at
this time of night.

18:12.002 --> 18:13.614
That's what happens around here.

18:13.656 --> 18:16.007
Hard to enforce bedtime when
the parents are out partying.

18:16.050 --> 18:17.487
It's like
a random Tuesday night,

18:17.530 --> 18:19.054
and they're in there
having a block party.

18:21.273 --> 18:23.840
What's with
Little Lord Fauntleroy?

18:23.884 --> 18:25.407
JAMIE:
That's Marconi's kid.

18:25.451 --> 18:27.453
Honor roll at
Parker Mac Prep.

18:27.497 --> 18:29.064
Is he part
of the family business?No.

18:29.107 --> 18:30.457
He's supposed to take
the whole thing legit one day.

18:30.500 --> 18:31.632
What's his name?

18:31.674 --> 18:32.980
Futuro.

18:33.023 --> 18:33.938
The future.

18:35.548 --> 18:38.421
Well, maybe the future holds
the key to our salvation, then.

18:38.464 --> 18:39.552
What do you got in mind?

18:39.596 --> 18:40.989
When's the last time

18:41.031 --> 18:42.990
your cops made
some good overtime?

18:43.034 --> 18:44.601
Hey.

18:44.644 --> 18:46.516
[whispers]:
Shh. Close the door.

18:46.559 --> 18:48.170
I'm hiding.

18:48.213 --> 18:49.911
From?

18:49.953 --> 18:51.130
The Think Police.

18:51.173 --> 18:53.348
It's Thought Police.What?

18:53.393 --> 18:54.959
Orwell's 1984.

18:55.002 --> 18:56.917
It's Thought Police,
not Think Police.

18:56.961 --> 18:59.137
Okay, well, the governor's
people are in my office,

18:59.181 --> 19:00.964
giving my entire life
a colonoscopy,

19:01.009 --> 19:02.618
and I need a break.It's a waste

19:02.663 --> 19:04.403
of time. It's not like
they're not gonna pick you.

19:04.446 --> 19:06.797
Apparently,
there's someone else in the mix.

19:06.840 --> 19:08.103
Get out of here. Who?

19:09.712 --> 19:11.846
You don't know anything
about him?Just that

19:11.888 --> 19:13.542
whoever it is,
a little birdie told me

19:13.586 --> 19:15.632
that they came out
squeaky-clean.

19:15.675 --> 19:18.068
Eh, probably just a formality

19:18.113 --> 19:21.115
to demonstrate they considered
other candidates.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.727
Doesn't feel like a formality.

19:23.770 --> 19:25.685
You got nothing to worry about.

19:25.729 --> 19:27.730
Even if this guy is Mr. Clean,

19:27.775 --> 19:29.558
you're still
Miss Goody Two-shoes.

19:29.603 --> 19:31.125
I am not.Oh, that's right.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.214
There was that time
you went jaywalking.

19:33.259 --> 19:36.609
In my day, I was the wild one.
A rebel, even.

19:36.653 --> 19:37.872
Uh-huh.

19:37.914 --> 19:39.787
I am not Miss Goody Two-shoes.

19:39.829 --> 19:42.572
No, but you're Miss Future
Acting District Attorney,

19:42.615 --> 19:44.922
so they have to vet you.
It's no biggie.

19:44.965 --> 19:48.098
Okay, you're not listening,
so could you just leave?

19:48.143 --> 19:50.537
Yeah, well, there's one problem.
This is my office.

19:52.538 --> 19:53.844
Fine.

19:58.371 --> 20:00.415
[door opens]

20:01.982 --> 20:04.420
Sorry to interrupt,
but you have a visitor.

20:04.463 --> 20:07.770
[sighs] What,
we taking walk-ins now?

20:07.815 --> 20:09.859
I got a call from downstairs.

20:09.903 --> 20:11.992
You need to take this meeting.

20:13.255 --> 20:14.647
I do?

20:14.691 --> 20:16.998
It's Paula Hill.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.740
Oh.

20:30.403 --> 20:32.230
Hi.

20:32.273 --> 20:34.842
Hi. I'm sorry
for showing up like this.

20:34.884 --> 20:37.410
I'm sure I'm breaking
all sorts of protocols.

20:37.452 --> 20:41.282
You're family.
Family gets a pass on protocol.

20:41.326 --> 20:43.111
Yeah, I'm not family.

20:44.416 --> 20:48.072
[chuckles]: Well, you're
the mother of my grandson.

20:48.115 --> 20:50.074
They may not have
a section for that

20:50.117 --> 20:51.423
in the greeting card aisle,
but...

20:51.467 --> 20:53.948
We're not your family.

20:54.949 --> 20:56.906
Okay.

20:56.951 --> 20:59.692
Yes, my son may be related
to you by blood, but I'm...

20:59.736 --> 21:02.130
Okay, I stand corrected.
I'm sorry.

21:02.173 --> 21:04.132
It's why I'm here.

21:04.174 --> 21:05.307
To correct me?

21:05.351 --> 21:07.482
I want him to stay Joe Hill.

21:07.527 --> 21:09.049
He isJoe Hill.Not if

21:09.093 --> 21:10.834
it gets out who his father is.

21:10.877 --> 21:12.705
Who his real family is.

21:12.749 --> 21:14.708
Youare his real family.

21:14.750 --> 21:16.797
Yeah, I always thought so.

21:16.839 --> 21:19.103
But things have changed.

21:19.146 --> 21:21.540
He's a hero cop
being paraded around.

21:21.584 --> 21:23.846
As Detective Joe Hill.

21:25.632 --> 21:28.461
Look, I-I...

21:28.503 --> 21:31.898
I don't understand
what you're getting at here.

21:34.554 --> 21:37.861
Are you gonna claim him
as one of yours?

21:39.863 --> 21:42.125
Oh, Paula.

21:42.170 --> 21:44.346
That's just not who we are.

21:44.390 --> 21:46.347
Well, he's all I have.

21:46.392 --> 21:48.785
And he's a Hill

21:48.828 --> 21:50.743
of the Warwick, Rhode Island
Hills,

21:50.787 --> 21:52.615
and that is important to us.

21:52.659 --> 21:54.313
Well, of course it is.

21:54.355 --> 21:55.617
I would never.

21:55.662 --> 21:58.490
Wewould never.

21:58.534 --> 22:02.407
And this is a conversation
between you and your son,

22:02.451 --> 22:03.409
not you and me.

22:03.451 --> 22:05.105
Yeah, it is.

22:05.148 --> 22:07.455
If you tell him
to keep it a secret, he will.

22:07.500 --> 22:08.848
But it's all up to him.

22:08.892 --> 22:10.851
Please don't deny me again.

22:10.894 --> 22:14.420
I can't deny you something

22:14.462 --> 22:17.553
that was never in my power
to withhold in the first place.

22:17.596 --> 22:19.381
You could talk to him.

22:19.424 --> 22:20.512
Please.

22:20.556 --> 22:22.165
And say what?

22:22.210 --> 22:24.298
Uh, "forget you ever met us"?

22:24.343 --> 22:26.866
Whatever it takes.

22:29.434 --> 22:30.913
[sighs]

22:30.958 --> 22:32.915
Okay, I'll talk to him.

22:32.960 --> 22:35.309
On one condition.

22:35.354 --> 22:38.661
That it's after dinner
at our place

22:38.704 --> 22:41.359
this Sunday...

22:41.403 --> 22:43.926
and you are there.

22:47.670 --> 22:50.412
â™ª

22:50.455 --> 22:52.632
Hey. Reagan here.

22:52.674 --> 22:54.589
How you doing, Jamie?
It's Baez.

22:54.634 --> 22:56.592
I'm doing well, Detective.
How about yourself?

22:56.635 --> 22:59.421
Oh, you know,
another day, another collar.

22:59.464 --> 23:00.988
Copy that.

23:01.030 --> 23:02.729
You heard
from your brother today?

23:02.771 --> 23:03.903
No, I thought he was with you.

23:03.946 --> 23:04.948
DANNY:
Relax. I'm here.

23:04.991 --> 23:06.210
BAEZ:
About time.

23:06.253 --> 23:09.125
DANNY:
You want to trade places
with me?

23:09.170 --> 23:10.953
BAEZ:
Uh, absolutely not.

23:10.998 --> 23:11.954
DANNY:
Then quit your carping.

23:11.999 --> 23:12.694
JANKO:
Hey, guys.

23:12.739 --> 23:14.696
How you all doing?

23:14.740 --> 23:16.438
My hamstrings are killing me.

23:16.481 --> 23:18.092
My back's killing me.

23:18.134 --> 23:19.180
Well, I have to go
to the bathroom.

23:19.222 --> 23:20.660
Well, Jamko and I
are super ready

23:20.702 --> 23:22.443
and super psyched to go.

23:22.488 --> 23:25.403
Well, goody. Is anyone else
super-duper ready to go?

23:25.446 --> 23:27.230
Copy.How about you, baby brother?

23:27.275 --> 23:28.189
Copy.

23:28.231 --> 23:30.496
Ready?

23:30.538 --> 23:31.452
Go.

23:33.412 --> 23:34.891
Go.

23:34.934 --> 23:36.197
Go, go, go, go.

23:36.240 --> 23:37.938
[whispers]:
Let's go.

23:41.507 --> 23:42.986
DANNY:Police! Drop your weapons!JANKO: Police!

23:43.029 --> 23:44.204
[indistinct shouting]

23:47.469 --> 23:49.036
BAEZ:
Police! Stop!

23:54.519 --> 23:55.781
MAN:
Hey, man, get off me.

23:55.825 --> 23:57.131
You got nothing on me, okay?

23:57.173 --> 23:59.133
[overlapping chatter]

23:59.175 --> 24:00.526
I didn't do nothing.

24:00.568 --> 24:03.049
Somebody call my lawyer.

24:03.093 --> 24:05.355
Hey, keep your hands off me.

24:05.400 --> 24:06.488
[whispers]:
Hey.

24:06.531 --> 24:07.881
Can you believe this?

24:07.923 --> 24:09.970
It was good work.

24:10.012 --> 24:11.275
You're really enjoying this,
aren't you?

24:11.318 --> 24:13.016
Aren't you?
I mean, look around,

24:13.059 --> 24:15.584
there's, like, every single one
of Marconi's soldiers in here.

24:15.627 --> 24:18.457
We did shut him down.I'm telling you,
this is

24:18.500 --> 24:20.459
a crazy cool plan
your partner cooked up.

24:20.501 --> 24:23.374
Yeah, well, whatever you do,
do not tell him that.

24:23.417 --> 24:25.201
Where's Danny, anyway?

24:26.595 --> 24:27.988
Well, he's-he's yourpartner.

24:28.030 --> 24:29.642
He's yourbrother.

24:43.699 --> 24:46.962
â™ª

25:07.680 --> 25:09.202
I come bearing gifts.

25:09.246 --> 25:10.421
Coffee and doughnuts.

25:10.464 --> 25:12.292
I'm gonna call you right back.

25:12.336 --> 25:15.035
And you better have the answer
I want to hear.

25:15.077 --> 25:17.037
Tough day
at the office there, John?

25:18.691 --> 25:21.345
Just say what you're gonna say
and then step off.

25:21.388 --> 25:24.434
Well, I... think you got a
lot more time on your hands

25:24.479 --> 25:26.786
than you think.What's that supposed
to mean?

25:28.482 --> 25:31.268
It means
they're not coming back.

25:31.311 --> 25:34.663
Your little foot soldiers,
they're in jail.
You think

25:34.707 --> 25:37.230
your trumped-up bullcrap charges
are gonna stick?

25:37.273 --> 25:38.711
Please.Hmm, they'll stick
for a few days.

25:38.753 --> 25:40.538
And then I'll just
trump up some more.

25:40.582 --> 25:41.931
And you don't think
I can get more soldiers?

25:41.974 --> 25:43.759
You don't think
I can get more cops?

25:43.802 --> 25:45.805
I can do this every day
if I have to.

25:45.847 --> 25:47.067
I'm not sure
you could say the same.

25:47.109 --> 25:49.068
Hey. Big ears.

25:49.112 --> 25:50.983
Get going to school.

25:51.027 --> 25:52.246
Yes, sir.

25:52.288 --> 25:54.509
Wow. Sir.

25:54.552 --> 25:56.467
I don't get that
out of my kids.

25:57.643 --> 25:58.644
Have a good day.

25:59.949 --> 26:01.255
I love you.

26:04.563 --> 26:07.217
He seems like a good kid.
Fine young man.

26:07.260 --> 26:09.349
His ears really aren't
that big, though.

26:09.393 --> 26:10.873
You got cuffs for me, or what?

26:10.916 --> 26:12.221
Not yet.

26:12.266 --> 26:13.833
Then get the hell out.

26:17.140 --> 26:18.794
Well...

26:20.056 --> 26:22.276
Enjoy your doughnuts.

26:26.410 --> 26:28.020
She's still busy.

26:28.064 --> 26:30.109
This is the third time today
you stopped me.

26:30.153 --> 26:31.720
Are they still grilling her
in there?

26:31.763 --> 26:33.242
All I know is, she's busy.

26:33.287 --> 26:34.593
And I know she needs a break.

26:37.987 --> 26:39.684
Oh.

26:39.728 --> 26:41.817
Uh, I'm sorry, I thought
you were still in here

26:41.861 --> 26:43.513
with the governor's people.

26:44.515 --> 26:45.778
They left.

26:45.820 --> 26:47.779
My bad.
I should've listened to the kid.

26:47.823 --> 26:49.477
Apologies.

26:49.519 --> 26:52.174
Maybe next time you'll at least
knock before barging in.

26:56.266 --> 26:58.616
I'm kidding. Oh, my God, you
should have seen the two of you.

26:58.660 --> 27:00.053
[laughs]

27:00.096 --> 27:01.357
Sorry, guys,
I have

27:01.402 --> 27:02.403
a twisted sense of humor.

27:02.445 --> 27:04.839
Anthony, I'd like you to meet

27:04.884 --> 27:06.667
Kimberly Crawford.

27:06.711 --> 27:10.715
Um, a college friend
of mine from Atlanta.

27:10.759 --> 27:12.934
Well, nice to meet you.
Well, not really.

27:12.979 --> 27:14.153
[chuckles]

27:14.196 --> 27:16.286
Uh, I'm gonna get out
of your hair.

27:16.329 --> 27:19.246
I... just wanted to see
how that thing went.

27:19.288 --> 27:21.074
All good. Talk later.

27:27.079 --> 27:28.864
Hey, what's up?
I got your text.

27:28.907 --> 27:30.648
You mind closing the door?

27:30.692 --> 27:33.215
Oh.Nothing but ears and eyeballs
out there.

27:34.521 --> 27:36.306
Did we get a big case
or something?

27:36.349 --> 27:37.655
No, it's personal.
It's about your friend.

27:38.874 --> 27:40.093
Your college friend?

27:41.094 --> 27:42.311
Oh. Right.

27:42.355 --> 27:44.096
What, um... what about her?

27:44.140 --> 27:45.402
She single?

27:45.445 --> 27:47.535
You're kidding me, right?

27:47.577 --> 27:49.450
What? I like a woman
who busts chops.

27:49.492 --> 27:51.233
Besides, she's great looking.

27:51.278 --> 27:54.454
Yeah, and, uh, smart as a whip.

27:54.498 --> 27:56.848
She's the whole package.So, what,

27:56.892 --> 27:58.894
I'm not good enough for her?
Is that it?

27:58.938 --> 28:00.895
No, that's not...Then what,
she's married?

28:00.940 --> 28:03.159
No. I mean, maybe.
I-I don't... I don't know.

28:03.202 --> 28:05.683
You don't know? I mean,
you've been pals since college?

28:05.727 --> 28:07.336
I don't know, uh...

28:07.381 --> 28:09.383
It's, uh...

28:10.384 --> 28:12.125
Uh...

28:12.167 --> 28:15.040
she was valedictorian
of her class at Howard.

28:15.084 --> 28:17.478
You know, all this time
I didn't know you went

28:17.520 --> 28:19.653
to a historically Black
university.

28:21.700 --> 28:24.571
You do remember
that I am a detective, right?

28:26.487 --> 28:27.792
Fine.

28:29.316 --> 28:31.926
She's not my friend
from college.
No,

28:31.971 --> 28:33.537
she's the acting D.A.
in Atlanta.

28:33.580 --> 28:36.888
And as far as I can tell, we
don't have any extradition cases

28:36.932 --> 28:39.455
with the great
state of Georgia.

28:39.500 --> 28:42.633
Which begs the question, what
the hell is she doing up here?

28:43.634 --> 28:45.854
She is the other candidate

28:45.897 --> 28:47.637
that the governor
is considering.

28:47.682 --> 28:49.249
I figured as much.

28:49.291 --> 28:51.990
But what I can't figure out is
why you are breaking bread

28:52.034 --> 28:53.513
with the competition.

28:53.557 --> 28:55.603
It wasn't my idea.
She just showed up unannounced.

28:55.645 --> 28:59.259
Thought it was a good idea
that we got to know each other.

28:59.301 --> 29:03.262
You know, in that "may
the best woman win" sort of way.

29:03.306 --> 29:04.351
Ballsy.

29:05.743 --> 29:06.832
Yeah.

29:06.875 --> 29:08.442
What was your
takeaway?

29:08.484 --> 29:10.313
I hate her.

29:10.356 --> 29:12.054
Incompetent empty suit?

29:12.097 --> 29:14.839
Brilliant force
to be reckoned with.

29:16.929 --> 29:20.019
â™ª

29:23.586 --> 29:25.327
[tires squeal]Oh.

29:25.372 --> 29:26.634
Oh, you see that?

29:26.676 --> 29:27.940
I did.

29:27.982 --> 29:30.550
Looked like a failure
to signal a lane change.

29:30.594 --> 29:32.204
Yep, that's
a two-point violation.

29:32.248 --> 29:34.729
Like me to do
the honors, boss?
Please.

29:34.772 --> 29:36.644
[siren wailing]

29:47.394 --> 29:48.176
[siren stops]

29:55.315 --> 29:57.143
License and registration,
please.

29:57.185 --> 29:58.752
MAN:
Yes.

29:58.797 --> 30:00.972
Sorry, Officer.
Uh, did I do something wrong?

30:01.016 --> 30:03.148
I don't think
I did anything.

30:03.192 --> 30:05.846
Futuro?
The hell kind of name is that?

30:05.891 --> 30:08.109
I don't know.You don't know?

30:08.153 --> 30:09.763
Who would know?My dad.

30:09.807 --> 30:11.330
[chuckles]
I guess.

30:11.374 --> 30:12.897
I guess he would.Yeah.

30:12.941 --> 30:14.334
Can I just get my ticket and go?

30:14.376 --> 30:15.769
Oh, I thought you
didn't do anything wrong.

30:15.814 --> 30:17.728
Well, I-I didn't.

30:17.771 --> 30:19.686
You just asked for a ticket.No, I didn't ask
for a ticket.

30:19.730 --> 30:21.340
No, you asked for a ticket.

30:21.384 --> 30:23.298
I-I didn't mean it like that.
I-I guess I, um...

30:23.343 --> 30:25.171
Sorry, that was
a weird thing to say. Sorry.

30:25.213 --> 30:26.999
You okay there, Futuro?
You seem a little nervous.

30:27.041 --> 30:28.130
You're getting squirrelly.No,

30:28.173 --> 30:29.696
I'm not... I'm not nervous,
I just...

30:32.394 --> 30:34.615
You're that cop
who was in my living room.

30:34.657 --> 30:35.615
Mm.

30:35.659 --> 30:37.182
[sniffing]

30:37.226 --> 30:39.228
I smell something.
Do you smell something?

30:40.576 --> 30:42.230
[sniffs]

30:42.275 --> 30:44.103
What smell?
I don't smell nothing.

30:44.145 --> 30:46.278
You don't smell nothing?Mm-mm.

30:46.322 --> 30:48.890
You go to Parker Mac Prep,
correct?

30:48.933 --> 30:51.371
So you should know it's,
"I don't smell anything."

30:51.413 --> 30:54.113
That's a, uh...

30:54.155 --> 30:56.244
Double negative.Double negative, right?

30:56.288 --> 30:58.160
Anything. I don't smell
anything. Thank you.

30:58.203 --> 31:00.249
Well, I do. So if
you don't mind,

31:00.292 --> 31:02.861
my partner's gonna take a
look inside the car, okay?

31:07.560 --> 31:08.997
No. Thank you.

31:09.040 --> 31:10.868
Well, yes, thank you.
Probable cause.

31:14.654 --> 31:16.830
DANNY:
And I'll see your
registration now, please.

31:24.490 --> 31:26.928
You know,
the God's honest truth is,

31:26.971 --> 31:29.147
I kind of feel badly for you.

31:29.191 --> 31:31.237
You spend all those years
keeping your son away

31:31.279 --> 31:33.804
from your illegal
drug business,

31:33.847 --> 31:37.112
and the one time he has to
help out in an emergency,

31:37.155 --> 31:39.244
the cops just happen to be there
to scoop him up.

31:39.288 --> 31:41.550
I mean, what are the odds, huh?

31:41.595 --> 31:43.117
The future's so bright,
I gotta wear shades.

31:44.510 --> 31:46.077
It's an '80s song.

31:46.121 --> 31:47.470
[chuckles]
You don't like the '80s?

31:47.513 --> 31:49.558
What do you want?What do I want?

31:49.603 --> 31:53.040
Well, I want you to confess to
the murder of Reggie Williams.

31:53.085 --> 31:55.260
That's what I want.

31:55.304 --> 31:57.523
No? Okay.

31:57.567 --> 31:58.960
Well, then, I guess
we're gonna find out

31:59.003 --> 32:01.962
exactly how well you raised
your son over there.

32:02.007 --> 32:04.487
I mean, I'm sure you raised him
to be hard enough

32:04.530 --> 32:08.230
for Parker Mac Academy.

32:08.273 --> 32:09.884
But did you raise him
hard enough

32:09.928 --> 32:11.493
for Rikers Island, I wonder?

32:16.325 --> 32:19.501
All right, I do this
and you cut him loose?

32:19.546 --> 32:23.332
Do this and I'll make sure
he's tucked in tonight myself.

32:26.378 --> 32:28.597
Deal.

32:28.642 --> 32:29.990
What's that?

32:30.035 --> 32:32.211
Deal.

32:32.253 --> 32:33.472
Oh. You hear that, kid?
We got a deal.

32:33.516 --> 32:34.909
You get him home now.
He needs his sleep.

32:34.952 --> 32:37.259
Hey, whatever you say.

32:37.302 --> 32:39.479
Yo, what the hell...Hey, hey!

32:39.521 --> 32:41.001
Ooh, sit down.

32:41.046 --> 32:42.873
What's your problem?

32:42.916 --> 32:44.309
That's my mother you got
in cuffs right there.

32:45.615 --> 32:49.489
Tha-That's your mom? Oh.
[chuckles]

32:49.531 --> 32:50.750
Looks like we're having
a family reunion here.

32:50.794 --> 32:52.448
What do you know?

32:52.491 --> 32:54.624
What the hell are you trying
to pull here, Detective?

32:54.667 --> 32:56.757
Me? I'm not the one
that put your mom

32:56.799 --> 32:59.628
on the Amtrak,
fully loaded with product.

32:59.673 --> 33:01.631
You did that.

33:01.674 --> 33:03.938
Just like you did with Futuro.

33:05.243 --> 33:07.897
Uh, she's got to be
in this deal, too, all right?

33:07.942 --> 33:09.726
I cop to whacking that dude,

33:09.769 --> 33:11.510
then Mom and Futuro walk.

33:11.554 --> 33:13.948
No, no, no, no. The deal
was for him, not for her.

33:13.991 --> 33:15.253
You want a deal for your mom,

33:15.297 --> 33:16.906
you're gonna have
to give me something else.

33:20.606 --> 33:22.869
But I don't got nothing else.

33:22.913 --> 33:25.089
Well, then it's gonna be a hell
of a long ride down to Rikers

33:25.133 --> 33:26.221
for you and Mommy.

33:31.487 --> 33:33.315
All set, sir.

33:36.101 --> 33:38.798
[exhales]

33:50.680 --> 33:51.855
As you were.

33:55.250 --> 33:58.036
I always use this
place when, uh...

33:58.078 --> 33:59.689
there's a need for privacy.

33:59.732 --> 34:00.777
Sit down.

34:04.693 --> 34:06.044
[chuckles softly]

34:07.219 --> 34:09.525
What's the problem?

34:09.568 --> 34:12.050
Well, it started with my C.O.
giving me the two days off

34:12.092 --> 34:14.487
to do the interviews
and take photos,

34:14.530 --> 34:17.010
and he started calling it
"Kardashian duty."

34:17.054 --> 34:18.621
[chuckles]Going around,

34:18.664 --> 34:21.188
not really doing anything,
just... being famous.

34:22.451 --> 34:24.365
Your C.O. always a ballbuster?

34:24.409 --> 34:25.802
He's right, though.
That's all I'm doing,

34:25.846 --> 34:27.369
just basking in the spotlight.

34:27.413 --> 34:28.501
And that's not you?

34:28.543 --> 34:30.329
No. Never was.

34:30.371 --> 34:32.199
Even birthday parties--
I don't like 'em.

34:32.244 --> 34:34.376
Feels like all the attention
is on me just for being me.

34:34.420 --> 34:36.813
Well... that attention

34:36.856 --> 34:39.119
came to you
for a very good reason.

34:39.164 --> 34:40.990
A selfless action.

34:41.034 --> 34:42.818
It's not selfless
when you're retelling the story

34:42.862 --> 34:43.820
for the 20th time.

34:43.864 --> 34:45.039
Then it's just bragging.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.606
And it's not even
humblebragging,

34:47.650 --> 34:49.434
no matter how hard you spin it.

34:51.653 --> 34:55.963
My DCPI thinks it's very good
for the department.

34:56.920 --> 34:59.139
He's right.

35:00.402 --> 35:02.186
But?

35:02.230 --> 35:04.710
But...

35:04.753 --> 35:07.061
respectfully, can I go back to
the work you're paying me for?

35:10.282 --> 35:11.326
[exhales]

35:11.369 --> 35:13.110
What's the other reason?

35:14.373 --> 35:15.983
What other reason?

35:16.025 --> 35:19.726
Well, one more day of stroking
can't be all that painful.

35:20.987 --> 35:22.250
I heard you still had chops.

35:22.293 --> 35:24.121
I do.

35:26.340 --> 35:28.952
Couple reporters started digging
around in my background...

35:28.996 --> 35:32.391
[sniffs] asking questions
like they were, you know...

35:32.434 --> 35:34.043
Being real reporters.

35:34.088 --> 35:36.177
Family background,

35:36.221 --> 35:39.353
any relatives NYPD.

35:39.398 --> 35:41.487
And you want to keep that
to yourself.

35:41.530 --> 35:43.576
Yes, sir.

35:43.619 --> 35:45.186
I understand.

35:45.230 --> 35:46.882
Please don't take this
the wrong way.

35:46.927 --> 35:49.625
I couldn't possibly.

35:49.668 --> 35:51.844
Your dad,

35:51.887 --> 35:54.326
when he was going
into the academy,

35:54.369 --> 35:57.851
wanted to go in as Joe Conor.

35:57.893 --> 35:59.722
Conor was his middle name,

35:59.766 --> 36:00.809
on his mother's side.

36:03.335 --> 36:05.206
Why?

36:05.250 --> 36:07.556
His dad was the PC.

36:07.599 --> 36:10.079
His granddad had been the PC.

36:10.123 --> 36:13.474
I think he felt,
as a cop, that...

36:13.518 --> 36:16.782
he would either be standing
in our shadows

36:16.826 --> 36:18.436
or in the spotlight.

36:20.003 --> 36:22.789
But he was Detective Joe Reagan.

36:22.831 --> 36:25.182
Yeah. He, uh...

36:25.226 --> 36:30.188
finally came around to deciding
he'd rather face the music.

36:34.974 --> 36:36.541
[beep]Baker?

36:39.458 --> 36:41.981
That's what your dad decided.

36:45.027 --> 36:48.161
You do not have to make
the same decision.

36:50.773 --> 36:52.166
Sir?

36:56.300 --> 37:00.130
Get back out on the
street, Detective Hill.

37:01.740 --> 37:03.525
Yes, sir.

37:07.442 --> 37:09.226
Thank you.

37:12.186 --> 37:14.231
[door closes]

37:15.407 --> 37:17.103
â™ª

37:29.333 --> 37:30.596
â™ª

37:30.639 --> 37:32.423
MARCONI:
Look, I'm in a bad way,

37:32.467 --> 37:34.295
and I need
your help.

37:34.338 --> 37:36.340
All right? They got
me jammed up good.

37:36.384 --> 37:38.385
I ain't going down on my own.
I'm telling you that.

37:39.648 --> 37:41.083
Are you threatening me?

37:41.128 --> 37:43.869
No. I'm just being
straight with you.

37:43.913 --> 37:45.610
We both got a lot
of dirt on us.

37:47.481 --> 37:49.005
Hang on a second.

37:49.048 --> 37:50.005
Goggins,

37:50.050 --> 37:51.572
search him for a wire.

37:51.617 --> 37:52.791
Oh, come on.

37:52.835 --> 37:54.445
You can't be serious.

37:57.362 --> 37:59.233
He's clean.

37:59.277 --> 38:00.713
All right,
now,

38:00.755 --> 38:02.670
you listen to me good.

38:02.715 --> 38:04.978
You tell them whatever you want
about what we did together,

38:05.021 --> 38:06.980
'cause I will deny
every last thing.

38:07.023 --> 38:08.329
And who do you think
they're gonna believe,

38:08.373 --> 38:11.505
drug kingpin
or respected lawyer?

38:11.550 --> 38:13.726
I paid you
for those witness lists.

38:13.768 --> 38:16.815
You gave me every one
of those names, addresses.

38:16.858 --> 38:18.425
You're in this as much as me.

38:18.469 --> 38:19.557
Yeah. You paid me.

38:19.601 --> 38:21.733
In cash, moron.

38:21.777 --> 38:23.344
Why do you think that is?

38:23.387 --> 38:25.780
So there is
absolutely no trace of it.

38:25.824 --> 38:27.956
So while you're counting away
the years in prison,

38:28.001 --> 38:30.699
I will be counting my money.

38:30.742 --> 38:32.222
That used to be your money.

38:33.398 --> 38:34.920
Now who's the gangster?

38:39.099 --> 38:41.362
The hell you smiling about?

38:41.405 --> 38:42.536
[exhales]

38:43.798 --> 38:44.800
Get him the hell out of here.

38:44.844 --> 38:46.541
I can't do that, sir.

38:46.585 --> 38:47.454
And why the hell not?

38:48.760 --> 38:50.762
Because Goggins is the one
wearing the wire.

38:52.460 --> 38:54.418
Goggins?

38:55.681 --> 38:57.900
Once a cop,
always a cop.

38:59.074 --> 39:01.338
Stand up.
You're under arrest.

39:02.688 --> 39:05.342
I'll see you at Rikers...

39:05.385 --> 39:06.561
gangsta.

39:06.605 --> 39:08.128
[handcuffs clacking]

39:08.170 --> 39:10.652
Told you I'd keep my promise.

39:10.695 --> 39:12.523
You have the right

39:12.567 --> 39:14.047
to remain silent.

39:14.090 --> 39:15.440
[elevator bell dings]

39:20.793 --> 39:22.577
What, are you
moving in here?

39:22.621 --> 39:24.449
Yes, Anthony.

39:24.492 --> 39:27.059
I thought it was time we take
our relationship to a new level.

39:27.103 --> 39:28.496
You look like hell.

39:28.539 --> 39:30.802
And you're sweeping me
off my feet again.

39:30.846 --> 39:32.717
Is there a reason
you're hiding out in here?

39:33.980 --> 39:35.764
I'm a good person, right,
Anthony?

39:37.025 --> 39:38.463
For the most part.

39:38.505 --> 39:40.552
I mean, I...

39:40.594 --> 39:41.900
try to do the right thing.

39:41.943 --> 39:43.423
I treat people with respect.

39:43.467 --> 39:46.471
I'm fair.
Right?

39:46.514 --> 39:47.733
Fair-ish.

39:47.775 --> 39:49.952
When am I not fair?

39:49.996 --> 39:51.344
When you cheat at, uh, cards,

39:51.389 --> 39:52.650
chess, Monopoly,

39:52.693 --> 39:53.913
Chutes and Ladders,

39:53.956 --> 39:55.697
Jenga...Okay, just because I win

39:55.740 --> 39:56.916
doesn't mean I cheat.

39:56.958 --> 39:57.916
Okay, fine.

39:57.960 --> 39:58.918
For the record,

39:58.960 --> 40:01.094
you're a wonderful human being.

40:01.137 --> 40:02.922
Thank you.

40:04.489 --> 40:07.405
Then how come I can't find it
in my heart to be happy for her,

40:07.447 --> 40:08.797
when I know I should?

40:09.797 --> 40:10.842
Oh, no.

40:12.061 --> 40:15.195
The governor called.

40:15.237 --> 40:17.632
He will be announcing
Kimberly Crawford

40:17.675 --> 40:20.679
as the next D.A. Monday morning.

40:22.114 --> 40:24.333
Oh, Erin, I'm so sorry.

40:24.378 --> 40:26.161
â™ª

40:31.559 --> 40:32.952
Every Sunday?

40:32.994 --> 40:35.170
Come hell or high water.

40:35.215 --> 40:37.739
Like, literally
every single Sunday?

40:37.782 --> 40:39.784
Every single solitary Sunday.

40:39.827 --> 40:41.264
Of our entire lives.

40:41.307 --> 40:43.135
You guys have never canceled
family dinner?

40:43.179 --> 40:44.485
Never. Not once.

40:44.528 --> 40:46.530
Never will. Not gonna happen.

40:46.574 --> 40:48.054
What if one of
you gets sick?

40:48.097 --> 40:50.230
If it's just a cold, you wash
your hands and take a seat.

40:50.273 --> 40:51.536
How do you know this?

40:51.579 --> 40:53.275
You think I didn't ask
all these same questions

40:53.320 --> 40:54.494
my first time here?[chuckling]

40:54.539 --> 40:55.496
JANKO: Something else
you should know--

40:55.539 --> 40:57.585
attendance is mandatory.

40:57.628 --> 40:58.760
Yeah, unless you're bleeding,

40:58.804 --> 41:00.195
your butt better be
in that seat.

41:00.239 --> 41:01.153
Exactly.

41:01.197 --> 41:02.460
Busted-up nose.

41:02.503 --> 41:03.590
100-degree fever.

41:03.635 --> 41:04.679
DANNY:
Which you like to pretend

41:04.722 --> 41:05.940
to have every now
and again

41:05.985 --> 41:07.202
so he doesn't have
to go to school.

41:07.246 --> 41:08.335
[chuckles]Unless it's more serious,

41:08.378 --> 41:10.510
like when Grandpa had
a heart attack.

41:10.554 --> 41:11.512
JAMIE:
In that case,

41:11.556 --> 41:12.860
family dinner comes to you.

41:12.905 --> 41:14.907
You all just crowded
into his hospital room?

41:14.949 --> 41:16.690
No, we commandeered
the commissary.

41:16.735 --> 41:18.170
We had a big bird

41:18.213 --> 41:19.824
and all the fixings.
It was great.

41:19.867 --> 41:22.001
I wheeled up.

41:22.043 --> 41:23.045
[chuckling]ERIN:
Yeah.

41:23.088 --> 41:23.916
And no matter
what day of the week

41:23.958 --> 41:25.351
your birthday falls on,

41:25.394 --> 41:27.876
your birthday dinner is...

41:27.920 --> 41:29.050
here on Sunday.Mm-hmm.

41:29.094 --> 41:30.487
[phone buzzing]

41:30.530 --> 41:31.836
My wedding reception.

41:31.880 --> 41:33.360
Our rehearsal dinner.

41:33.402 --> 41:34.927
All right.
Anything else I should know?

41:34.969 --> 41:37.668
No phones at the table.

41:37.711 --> 41:38.887
[phone buzzing]

41:38.931 --> 41:40.889
No texts, no calls.

41:40.932 --> 41:42.717
Yes. That's a rule.

41:42.760 --> 41:44.152
Except when it's not.

41:44.197 --> 41:46.242
Excuse me.

41:46.286 --> 41:47.592
PAULA:
Wow, no phones.

41:47.635 --> 41:50.898
That's so... last century.

41:50.943 --> 41:52.335
Well, we also churn
our own butter,

41:52.378 --> 41:54.206
which is, what,two centuries?[chuckling]

41:54.250 --> 41:55.686
I don't know what's
what with you people.

41:55.730 --> 41:58.079
That's kind of the point.
It keeps you on your toes.

41:58.123 --> 41:59.952
[chuckles]:
Seems exhausting.

41:59.994 --> 42:01.431
No, it's-it's invigorating,

42:01.474 --> 42:02.431
actually.

42:02.476 --> 42:03.432
Keeps me young.

42:03.476 --> 42:04.826
Keeps them on...

42:04.869 --> 42:05.565
the straight
and narrow.

42:05.610 --> 42:07.045
And him, too.

42:07.088 --> 42:08.742
[Paula chuckles]

42:10.614 --> 42:12.137
Everything okay?

42:14.356 --> 42:17.447
Apparently,

42:17.490 --> 42:21.539
someone got to someone in
the Suffolk County offices

42:21.581 --> 42:25.106
about a certain
birth certificate.

42:25.150 --> 42:28.110
It'll be on the websites
tonight.

42:28.153 --> 42:30.764
They know who you are.

42:30.809 --> 42:33.246
The secret is out.
