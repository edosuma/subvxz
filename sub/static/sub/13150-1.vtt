WEBVTT

00:35.035 --> 00:36.402
COME IN.

00:38.672 --> 00:41.474
HI, MAMA. HOW YOU DOING?

00:41.475 --> 00:43.309
HANGING IN THERE?

00:43.310 --> 00:44.310
YEAH.

00:44.311 --> 00:45.311
OKAY.

00:45.312 --> 00:48.047
GO AHEAD AND LAY BACK.

00:48.048 --> 00:49.682
AND SCOOT DOWN.

00:49.683 --> 00:50.850
ALL RIGHT.

00:50.851 --> 00:53.986
LET'S SEE HOW WE'RE HEALING UP.

00:55.188 --> 00:56.656
WHERE'S THE LITTLE ONE?

00:56.657 --> 00:57.857
HOME WITH DADDY?

00:57.858 --> 01:00.226
YES.

01:00.227 --> 01:02.428
ENJOYING MOTHERHOOD SO FAR?

01:02.429 --> 01:04.397
YES.

01:04.397 --> 01:07.500
ANY BLEEDING, HEMORRHOIDS, OR
ITCHING?

01:07.501 --> 01:09.035
UM, NO.

01:09.036 --> 01:10.136
GOOD.

01:10.137 --> 01:11.137
GOOD.

01:11.138 --> 01:12.738
WELL, INCISION'S HEALING UP

01:12.739 --> 01:13.739
GREAT.

01:13.740 --> 01:16.509
EVERYTHING LOOKS DANDY DOWN
THERE.

01:16.510 --> 01:19.350
ALL CLEAR FOR WHOOPEE, NOT THAT
MOST WOMEN ARE RARING TO GO AT
SIX WEEKS.

01:21.615 --> 01:23.049
UH, BIRTH CONTROL?

01:23.050 --> 01:25.331
SOMEHOW I DON'T THINK WE'LL
BE NEEDING THAT RIGHT AWAY.

01:26.954 --> 01:28.421
YEAH.

01:28.422 --> 01:29.956
I'VE HEARD THAT ONE BEFORE.

01:29.957 --> 01:33.125
JUST HAD ONE IN HERE WITH A
2-MONTH-OLD AND PREGNANT AGAIN.

01:33.126 --> 01:34.526
SOUND LIKE YOUR IDEA
OF A GOOD TIME?

01:37.130 --> 01:40.032
SO, YOU KNOW, HAVE FUN BUT
PLAY IT SAFE.

01:40.033 --> 01:43.235
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS?

01:43.236 --> 01:44.070
UM...

01:44.071 --> 01:46.038
OKAY, GOOD TO SEE YOU.

01:46.039 --> 01:47.039
BYE NOW.

02:01.455 --> 02:03.175
I DON'T... I DON'T KNOW WHY
HE'S FUSSING.

02:05.592 --> 02:07.193
YOU WANT ME TO CHANGE HIM?

02:07.194 --> 02:08.461
I ALREADY DID THAT.

02:08.461 --> 02:10.262
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HIS PROBLEM IS.

02:10.263 --> 02:11.163
HERE.

02:11.164 --> 02:12.398
BRING HIM TO ME.

02:12.399 --> 02:14.467
I'LL TAKE HIM. COME HERE.

02:35.522 --> 02:38.724
I GOT MY SIX-WEEK CHECKUP TODAY.

02:38.725 --> 02:40.159
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.427
HOW'D THAT GO?

02:41.428 --> 02:43.229
GOOD.

02:43.230 --> 02:46.165
THE DOCTOR SAID WE COULD GET
BACK TO BUSINESS, IF YOU KNOW
WHAT I MEAN.

02:46.166 --> 02:48.100
REALLY?

02:48.101 --> 02:50.336
YOU UP FOR THAT?

02:50.337 --> 02:53.439
I AM IF YOU ARE.

02:53.440 --> 02:57.443
YOU KNOW, I JUST FIGURED
YOU'RE SO TIRED WITH THE BABY
AND EVERYTHING.

03:02.849 --> 03:05.217
JOSH, WE HAVEN'T HAD SEX IN SIX
MONTHS.

03:05.218 --> 03:06.619
RIGHT. RIGHT.

03:06.620 --> 03:07.620
NO NEED TO RUSH.

03:11.525 --> 03:12.625
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU...

03:12.626 --> 03:14.727
DO I DISGUST YOU?

03:14.728 --> 03:15.961
WHAT?

03:15.962 --> 03:17.263
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

03:17.264 --> 03:20.132
IS IT BECAUSE I HAVE STRETCH
MARKS NOW?

03:20.133 --> 03:21.567
AM I JUST GROSS TO YOU?

03:21.568 --> 03:23.248
YOU ARE PERFECT EXACTLY
THE WAY YOU ARE.

03:26.073 --> 03:29.008
OKAY?

03:29.009 --> 03:32.211
I'M SERIOUS.

03:36.183 --> 03:38.464
THEN WHY DON'T YOU STOP
JERKING OFF AND FUCK YOUR WIFE?

04:01.274 --> 04:03.542
OH, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.

04:17.324 --> 04:20.291
OH, YOU'RE SO SEXY.

04:27.901 --> 04:29.969
OH, GOD.

04:45.285 --> 04:48.087
HONEY!

04:48.088 --> 04:49.088
HONEY!

04:52.025 --> 04:53.659
FUCK.

04:53.660 --> 04:55.661
OH.

05:05.572 --> 05:08.174
WHAT TIME ARE YOU GONNA BE HOME
TONIGHT?

05:08.175 --> 05:09.708
UH, IT'S HARD TO SAY.

05:09.709 --> 05:12.945
THEY ARE REALLY KILLING US THIS
WEEK.

05:12.946 --> 05:14.146
BUT, UM, I'LL DO MY BEST.

05:17.350 --> 05:18.551
BYE.

06:35.962 --> 06:38.197
FUCK.

06:38.198 --> 06:40.399
YOU SUPPOSED TO BE SMOKING,
MOMMY?

06:41.434 --> 06:43.969
NONE OF YOUR FUCKING
BUSINESS.

06:43.970 --> 06:45.771
DO YOU MIND IF I HAVE ONE?

06:45.772 --> 06:47.773
ONE OF YOUR...

06:53.013 --> 06:54.013
THANK YOU.

06:57.050 --> 06:59.385
DO YOU HAVE A LIGHT?

06:59.386 --> 07:01.387
WHAT? DO YOU WANT ME TO LIGHT
IT FOR YOU?

07:01.388 --> 07:03.455
WOULD YOU MIND?

07:08.561 --> 07:10.429
THANK YOU.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.364
I'M CAL, BY THE WAY.

07:12.365 --> 07:13.565
I'M KELLY.

07:13.566 --> 07:15.801
NICE TO MEET YOU.

07:15.802 --> 07:18.704
YOUR KID IS CRYING, KELLY.

07:18.705 --> 07:20.205
I KNOW.

07:20.206 --> 07:23.309
THE WHOLE FUCKING NEIGHBORHOOD
CAN HEAR HIM CRY.

07:23.310 --> 07:26.211
SO, YOU'RE JUST GONNA LET HIM
CRY IT OUT?

07:26.212 --> 07:27.046
CRY IT OUT?

07:27.047 --> 07:29.815
IT'S CALLED FERBERIZING.

07:29.816 --> 07:30.916
WHEN THEY CRY.

07:30.917 --> 07:33.218
RIGHT, I THINK I HEARD OF
FERBERIZING.

07:34.087 --> 07:35.220
I'M SURE YOU HAVE.

07:35.221 --> 07:37.289
NO, I'M NOT KIDDING.

07:41.194 --> 07:42.928
OKAY.

07:42.929 --> 07:44.963
COOL. SMOKE RINGS.

07:45.799 --> 07:48.434
YOU HAVE GREAT TITS.

07:50.904 --> 07:52.271
EXCUSE ME?

07:52.272 --> 07:54.606
THIS LITTLE JUNIOR IN THERE
SHOULD BE MORE GRATEFUL.

07:54.607 --> 07:57.076
I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE, BUT
YOU SHOULD NOT...

07:57.077 --> 07:58.544
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. RELAX.

07:58.545 --> 08:01.480
I WAS TRYING TO GIVE YOU A
COMPLIMENT, LIKE A...

08:01.481 --> 08:03.482
GET AWAY FROM MY HOUSE.

08:03.483 --> 08:06.285
WELL, DRAW THE FREAKIN'
CURTAINS IF YOU DON'T WANT THE

08:06.286 --> 08:08.253
WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD TO WATCH YOU
BREASTFEED.

08:08.254 --> 08:09.521
IF YOU DON'T LEAVE, I'LL... I

08:09.522 --> 08:10.656
<i>WILL</i> CALL THE COPS.

08:10.657 --> 08:13.826
OKAY. OKAY. OKAY.

08:13.827 --> 08:17.096
OKAY.

08:17.097 --> 08:19.331
CIAO, MAMACITA.

08:23.536 --> 08:26.004
OH, FUCK.

08:30.143 --> 08:32.778
THAT'S, UH, SOME OPENING
LINE, YOU KNOW.

08:32.779 --> 08:33.779
"NICE TITS."

08:35.782 --> 08:37.649
I FEEL LIKE SUCH AN ASSHOLE.

08:37.650 --> 08:38.517
WHY?

08:38.518 --> 08:40.284
THE KID'S A PEEPING TOM.

08:40.285 --> 08:42.806
I KNOW, BUT HE'S KIND OF THE
FIRST REAL PERSON I'VE MET SINCE

08:44.891 --> 08:47.659
WE'VE MOVED HERE.

08:47.660 --> 08:50.796
OH, SO HE GETS A FREE PASS
BECAUSE HE'S IN A WHEELCHAIR?

08:50.797 --> 08:53.532
NO, I JUST SHOULDN'T HAVE
SNAPPED AT HIM.

08:54.501 --> 08:56.668
HE'S A PERV.

08:56.669 --> 08:58.270
WELL, AT LEAST SOMEONE'S
LOOKING.

09:01.608 --> 09:03.776
I'M LOOKING.

09:03.777 --> 09:07.417
IT'S JUST HARD TO THINK OF YOUR
BOOBS LIKE THAT WHEN THEY'RE
JACKSON'S FOOD SUPPLY RIGHT NOW.

09:07.747 --> 09:10.015
WOW.
SINCE YOU PUT IT LIKE THAT...

09:10.016 --> 09:11.550
KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD DO?

09:11.551 --> 09:13.085
TAKE THE BABY ON A STROLL.

09:13.086 --> 09:15.954
EXPLORE THE NEIGHBORHOOD A
LITTLE BIT, YOU KNOW?

09:15.955 --> 09:17.875
A LITTLE, UH, EXERCISE, GET THE
ENDORPHINS GOING.

09:19.492 --> 09:21.627
SURE.

09:21.628 --> 09:25.188
I'M EXHAUSTED, I CAN BARELY GET
DRESSED, BUT A NICE, BRISK WALK
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD... THAT

09:26.433 --> 09:29.601
MIGHT DO THE TRICK.

09:29.602 --> 09:31.670
YOU NEVER KNOW.

09:37.010 --> 09:38.010
IT'LL GET BETTER.

09:41.047 --> 09:43.115
SO THEY SAY.

10:01.734 --> 10:04.603
SHH. SHH, SHH.

10:06.673 --> 10:09.641
EASY.

10:13.012 --> 10:15.380
OKAY.

11:06.266 --> 11:08.700
HEY!

11:08.701 --> 11:11.003
HEY!

11:11.004 --> 11:12.337
HEY!

11:12.338 --> 11:13.238
WAIT!

11:13.239 --> 11:15.674
I AM NOWHERE NEAR YOUR HOUSE.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.109
OH, WAIT!

11:20.313 --> 11:22.848
WAIT.

11:22.849 --> 11:24.816
I WANTED TO APOLOGIZE FOR

11:24.817 --> 11:26.552
YELLING AT YOU BEFORE.

11:26.553 --> 11:27.686
OH, YEAH?

11:27.687 --> 11:28.520
YEAH.

11:28.521 --> 11:29.641
I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT, UM...

11:32.425 --> 11:34.059
OH, RIGHT. THE CHAIR.

11:34.060 --> 11:35.761
BECAUSE TOURETTES IS A COMMON

11:35.762 --> 11:37.002
SIDE EFFECT OF SPINAL INJURIES.

11:39.766 --> 11:41.500
OKAY.

11:41.501 --> 11:43.435
NO, I'VE JUST BEEN FEELING

11:43.436 --> 11:45.237
REALLY EXHAUSTED AND OUT OF

11:45.238 --> 11:47.172
SORTS, YOU KNOW, SINCE THE...

11:47.173 --> 11:49.174
YOU GOT YOUR BABY TO SLEEP.

11:49.175 --> 11:50.442
CONGRATULATIONS.

11:50.443 --> 11:51.877
YEAH, I DID.

11:51.878 --> 11:54.279
APPARENTLY HE... HE REALLY LIKES

11:54.280 --> 11:55.714
GOING ON WALKS.

11:55.715 --> 11:58.183
ME, TOO.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.053
YOU KNOW, THAT'S A JOKE ABOUT

12:01.054 --> 12:01.954
THE WALKING.

12:01.955 --> 12:03.055
YOU CAN LAUGH.

12:03.056 --> 12:04.723
RIGHT.

12:04.724 --> 12:06.058
OKAY.

12:06.059 --> 12:07.159
OKAY.

12:07.160 --> 12:09.528
THIS IS MY STOP.

12:09.529 --> 12:10.696
WOW.

12:10.697 --> 12:12.564
YOU LIVE <i>HERE?</i>

12:12.565 --> 12:15.767
NICE HOUSE.

12:15.768 --> 12:18.870
I ACCEPT YOUR APOLOGY,
AND IN RETURN,

12:18.871 --> 12:22.741
I APOLOGIZE IF I ADMIRED
YOUR BREASTS INAPPROPRIATELY.

12:34.587 --> 12:35.754
OH, HEY.

12:35.755 --> 12:36.922
Hey.

12:36.923 --> 12:39.491
Mom wanted to drop by for dinner
tonight.

12:39.492 --> 12:40.492
Okay with you?

12:40.493 --> 12:43.195
YE... SURE.

12:43.196 --> 12:44.396
HE'S SO BIG!

12:44.397 --> 12:46.031
HE'S SO BEAUTIFUL.

12:46.032 --> 12:47.032
SO SWEET.

12:47.033 --> 12:48.767
YOU ARE THE SWEETEST ONE!

12:49.769 --> 12:51.436
HE IS THE SWEETEST ONE EVER.

12:51.437 --> 12:53.405
AND YOU LOOK SO BEAUTIFUL,
JULIE.

12:53.406 --> 12:54.373
JACKSON.

12:54.374 --> 12:56.041
HE LOOKS JUST LIKE YOU,
KELLY.

12:56.042 --> 12:57.743
OOH, THAT IS PLENTY WINE.

12:57.744 --> 12:59.945
THIS WAS SO GREAT.

12:59.946 --> 13:01.179
THANKS AGAIN FOR COOKING, MOM.

13:01.180 --> 13:02.247
IT WAS REALLY GOOD.

13:02.248 --> 13:03.815
IT WAS MY PLEASURE, AS
ALWAYS.

13:03.816 --> 13:05.651
MM, MM, MM.

13:05.652 --> 13:07.719
OKAY. OKAY.

13:07.720 --> 13:10.389
DOES ANYBODY, UH, WANT
ANYTHING FROM THE KITCHEN?

13:10.390 --> 13:11.470
HOW WAS YOUR DAY, MOMMY?

13:14.227 --> 13:15.227
HUH?

13:17.930 --> 13:18.930
I'M SORRY.

13:20.199 --> 13:21.199
WHAT?

13:21.200 --> 13:22.200
YOU MUST BE EXHAUSTED.

13:22.201 --> 13:24.603
I WAS JUST WONDERING HOW YOUR
DAY WAS.

13:24.604 --> 13:25.637
OKAY.

13:27.340 --> 13:28.140
GOOD.

13:28.141 --> 13:29.441
I MET A NEIGHBOR.

13:29.442 --> 13:30.242
I, UH...

13:30.243 --> 13:31.443
ALL RIGHT.

13:31.444 --> 13:32.544
YOU DID?

13:32.545 --> 13:33.745
ALL RIGHT.

13:33.746 --> 13:34.613
GREAT.

13:34.614 --> 13:36.148
THAT'S WONDERFUL.

13:36.149 --> 13:38.283
REMEMBER OUR NEIGHBOR CHARLIE?

13:38.284 --> 13:40.152
HE'S BACK WITH HIS WIFE NOW.

13:40.153 --> 13:41.219
THE OLD WIFE?

13:41.220 --> 13:42.587
YEAH. MARY ELLEN.

13:42.588 --> 13:44.289
OH, GUYS, DON'T FORGET I'M

13:44.290 --> 13:47.192
TAKING JACKSON TO MY WALKING
GROUP ON THURSDAY.

14:03.843 --> 14:04.810
BUT I DON'T KNOW.

14:04.811 --> 14:05.777
MAYBE IT IS.

14:05.778 --> 14:06.812
MAYBE IT HAS TO DO WITH...

14:06.813 --> 14:09.848
HI.

14:09.849 --> 14:13.685
ARE YOU GUYS AN ORGANIZED
MOMMIES GROUP, OR YOU...?

14:13.686 --> 14:16.855
THIS IS THE GLENDORA PARK
MOTHER'S GROUP.

14:16.856 --> 14:19.825
COOL.

14:19.826 --> 14:22.266
WELL, I JUST MOVED HERE LIKE A
FEW MONTHS AGO, RIGHT BEFORE HE

14:23.830 --> 14:26.398
WAS BORN, SO I HAVEN'T GOTTEN
OUT YET.

14:26.399 --> 14:28.867
YOU SHOULD CHECK US OUT
ONLINE.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.402
OH.

14:30.403 --> 14:32.437
OKAY.

14:32.438 --> 14:35.718
YEAH, THERE'S AN APPLICATION
AND, UH, A MEMBERSHIP FEE FOR
SNACKS AND ACTIVITIES.

15:57.990 --> 16:00.590
OH, IT'S A STUPID GAME ME

16:02.295 --> 16:05.430
EX-GIRLFRIEND.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.338
UH, NO. I'M NURSING.

16:13.339 --> 16:15.307
OH, YOU KNOW, SOME CULTURES

16:15.308 --> 16:17.976
PRESCRIBE A DAILY BEER FOR
NURSING MOTHERS.

16:17.977 --> 16:18.977
GUINNESS, ESPECIALLY.

16:18.978 --> 16:21.112
I THINK I HAVE ONE BACK HERE.

16:21.113 --> 16:22.013
I LOVE GUINNESS.

16:22.014 --> 16:24.983
BUT I'M NOT... NO.

16:24.984 --> 16:25.984
UM, THANK YOU. UM...

16:29.021 --> 16:30.622
SO, YOU LIVE OUT HERE?

16:30.623 --> 16:31.623
YES, I DO.

16:31.624 --> 16:34.159
MY PARENTS DIDN'T WANT TO
REMODEL.

16:34.160 --> 16:35.560
IT FUCKS UP RESALE VALUE.

16:35.561 --> 16:36.361
WOW.

16:36.362 --> 16:38.029
ARE THEY GONNA INVEST IN A

16:38.030 --> 16:39.965
DECENT RAMP ANYTIME SOON?

16:39.966 --> 16:42.033
WHAT'S WRONG WITH MY RAMP?

16:42.034 --> 16:43.935
WOBBLES.

16:43.936 --> 16:45.570
WELL, I LIKE TO LIVE

16:45.571 --> 16:48.006
DANGEROUSLY.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.007
BESIDES, WHAT'S THE WORST THAT

16:49.008 --> 16:51.276
COULD HAPPEN, REALLY?

16:54.614 --> 16:56.681
SO...

16:56.682 --> 16:58.149
MY MOM IS SUDDENLY THIS HUGE

16:58.150 --> 16:59.050
CRUSADER FOR THE DISABLED.

16:59.051 --> 17:00.819
SHE'S ALL OVER THE HIGH SCHOOL

17:00.820 --> 17:02.053
TO UPGRADE ACCESS TO THE STADIUM

17:02.054 --> 17:03.822
FOR GRADUATION, WHICH I HAVE NO

17:03.823 --> 17:04.823
PLANS ON ATTENDING.

17:04.824 --> 17:06.290
BUT WHY SHOULD THAT STOP HER?

17:06.291 --> 17:07.759
I MEAN, THERE'S LIKE GENOCIDE IN

17:07.760 --> 17:09.394
DARFUR AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING ALL

17:09.395 --> 17:10.694
THROUGHOUT EASTERN EUROPE, BUT

17:10.695 --> 17:12.097
HER SON NEEDS A NEW FUCKING

17:12.098 --> 17:13.698
RAMP.

17:13.699 --> 17:16.800
YEAH. WHATEVER.

17:16.801 --> 17:20.038
SHE WAS PROBABLY SECRETLY
PLEASED WHEN IT HAPPENED.

17:20.039 --> 17:22.374
IT GAVE HER SOMETHING TO DO.

17:22.375 --> 17:26.310
FUCKING CLIPPED MY WINGS JUST A
LITTLE BIT.

17:26.311 --> 17:29.047
MY FATHER, ON THE OTHER HAND,
COMPLETELY CONVINCED THAT I'M

17:29.048 --> 17:31.728
NOT GONNA BE IN THIS CHAIR LONG
ENOUGH TO WARRANT GETTING A NEW
RAMP.

17:33.019 --> 17:34.786
HE'S ALL BEDAZZLED BY THESE,

17:34.787 --> 17:37.923
UH, NEW ADVANCES IN STEM-CELL
RESEARCH, YOU KNOW.

17:37.924 --> 17:40.926
THEORETICAL ADVANCES, MIND YOU.

17:40.927 --> 17:44.195
"YOU'LL BE VERTICAL IN NO TIME,
BUDDY."

17:44.196 --> 17:45.397
VERTICAL.

17:45.398 --> 17:46.865
FUCKING JOCK.

17:50.403 --> 17:52.037
OH, SHIT. MY BAD.

17:52.038 --> 17:53.405
IT'S NOT YOU.

17:53.406 --> 17:56.107
HE DOES THIS ALL THE TIME.

17:56.108 --> 17:59.377
IT'S LIKE HE HATES ME.

18:04.684 --> 18:06.217
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

18:06.218 --> 18:07.152
JACKSON.

18:07.153 --> 18:08.119
JACKSON?

18:08.120 --> 18:09.721
NO WONDER HE HATES YOU.

18:09.722 --> 18:10.522
HMM.

18:10.523 --> 18:12.424
CAN I CALL HIM JACK?

18:12.425 --> 18:13.758
YEAH. SURE.

18:13.759 --> 18:15.894
YOU EVER TRY SWADDLING?

18:15.895 --> 18:16.761
WHAT?

18:16.762 --> 18:18.363
SWADDLING.

18:18.364 --> 18:19.264
MAY I?

18:19.265 --> 18:21.066
OKAY.

18:21.067 --> 18:23.234
HAND HIM TO ME.

18:23.235 --> 18:25.971
HOLD HIS HEAD.

18:25.972 --> 18:28.039
TRY TO TAKE THIS BLANKET OFF
HERE. DON'T WANT HIM TO GET TOO HOT.

18:28.040 --> 18:29.774
HELLO, JACK. SHH.

18:30.776 --> 18:33.111
HE'S HANDSOME.

18:36.248 --> 18:39.050
THERE YOU GO.

18:39.051 --> 18:40.852
LOOK AT THAT, BUDDY.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.790
HEY, JACK.

18:45.791 --> 18:47.692
IT'S MY QUIET, LITTLE FRIEND
RIGHT THERE.

18:51.263 --> 18:52.998
WHERE DID YOU LEARN THAT?

18:52.999 --> 18:55.667
I USED TO WORK AT THIS
HALFWAY HOUSE FOR RECOVERING
METH ADDICTS.

18:55.668 --> 18:57.535
THERE WAS A LOT OF UNWED MOTHERS
THERE.

18:57.536 --> 19:00.171
AND JUST... TERRIBLE.

19:00.172 --> 19:01.539
REALLY?

19:01.540 --> 19:02.741
NO.

19:02.742 --> 19:06.011
I HAVE A BABY COUSIN I TAKE CARE
OF SOMETIMES.

19:06.012 --> 19:08.079
MOSTLY I JUST DO IT TO MESS WITH
MY DAD'S HEAD.

19:08.080 --> 19:08.913
HE GETS SO EXCITED.

19:08.914 --> 19:10.115
HE'S LIKE, "GOOD JOB, SON."

19:10.116 --> 19:11.916
YOU KNOW, THAT'S THE FIRST
THING HE ASKED THE DOCTOR

19:11.917 --> 19:14.219
WHEN I GOT INJURED WAS
CAN I STILL GET LAID.

19:14.220 --> 19:17.180
OF COURSE HE ASKED IN MORE
RESPECTABLE TERMS, LIKE, CAN I
STILL HAVE BABIES.

19:19.225 --> 19:21.760
NOW, THAT IS WHAT MOST PEOPLE
WANT TO KNOW, EXCEPT USUALLY,

19:21.761 --> 19:25.997
YOU KNOW, THEY'RE TOO SCARED TO
ASK UNLESS THEY'RE DRUNK.

19:25.998 --> 19:30.035
IT'S PRETTY AMAZING WHAT THEY
CAN DO THESE DAYS FOR THESE GUYS
THAT ARE, LIKE, HARDCORE CRIPS.

19:30.036 --> 19:33.138
YOU KNOW, THE GUYS THAT CAN'T
MOVE, LIKE, ZIP, ZILCH, NOTHING,
RIGHT?

19:33.139 --> 19:33.972
HOW DO THEY...

19:33.973 --> 19:38.109
THEY HAVE THIS, LIKE, ANAL

19:38.110 --> 19:40.712
VIBRATOR THING, AND THEY JUST STICK IT UP THE GUY'S ASS AND
BASICALLY STIMULATE THE POOR FUCKER UNTIL HE ORGASMS, THEN

19:40.713 --> 19:43.593
CLEAN UP THE BABY BATTER, USE IT
FOR IN VITRO, BOOM, HE'S OFF AND
RUNNING.

19:45.718 --> 19:48.553
SO, I GUESS NEVER STOP
BELIEVING.

19:48.554 --> 19:49.754
THAT'S GREAT.

19:49.755 --> 19:51.222
THAT... THAT'S...

19:51.223 --> 19:52.023
YEAH.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.224
THAT THEY CAN DO THAT.

19:53.225 --> 19:54.425
FORTUNATELY FOR SOME OF US,

19:57.563 --> 19:59.631
WE DON'T NEED THAT MUCH HELP.

20:03.269 --> 20:06.271
AND THE ANSWER'S YES, UH, IF THE

20:06.272 --> 20:09.574
LADY'S ON TOP.

20:09.575 --> 20:11.376
BUT ALSO MY TONGUE STILL WORKS.

20:14.847 --> 20:16.881
OKAY, I'M GONNA GO.

20:16.882 --> 20:19.551
UM, IT WAS NICE TALKING TO YOU.

20:19.552 --> 20:20.752
THANKS FOR SHARING YOUR PLACE.

20:23.089 --> 20:25.090

20:25.091 --> 20:27.959
HEY, IF YOU EVER, UH, NEED A

20:27.960 --> 20:30.361
SWADDLING, COME ON BACK.

20:30.362 --> 20:32.230
YEAH. OH, THANK YOU.

20:41.240 --> 20:44.409
I KNOW. I KNOW, I KNOW.

20:46.278 --> 20:48.012
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

20:48.013 --> 20:51.249
I'M JUST TRYING TO...

20:51.250 --> 20:52.050
I DON'T KNOW.

20:52.051 --> 20:52.884
HERE. HERE.

20:52.885 --> 20:54.719
JUST LET ME HAVE HIM.

20:54.720 --> 20:56.654
HI.

20:56.655 --> 20:59.257
OOH! HEY, BUDDY.

20:59.258 --> 21:01.326
WHAT'S UP?

21:07.833 --> 21:08.833
I SUCK.

21:09.935 --> 21:12.003
I SUCK AT THIS.

22:02.988 --> 22:04.722
JACK, MY MAIN MAN, YOU MADE

22:04.723 --> 22:05.723
IT BACK.

22:06.725 --> 22:08.693
SO, WHERE DID YOU GET DRUMS?

22:08.694 --> 22:10.328
OH, DEAR, OLD DAD.

22:10.329 --> 22:12.497
YOU KNOW, I, UH, WAS BUMMED OUT

22:12.498 --> 22:14.666
ABOUT THE GUITAR, SO HE WENT ON

22:14.667 --> 22:16.467
A BIT OF A SHOPPING SPREE.

22:16.468 --> 22:17.702
YOU GOT PROBLEMS, YOU THROW

22:17.703 --> 22:19.137
MONEY AT IT.

22:19.138 --> 22:21.372
IT'S A VERY SOPHISTICATED,
EMOTIONAL TECHNIQUE, YOU KNOW?

22:21.373 --> 22:23.074
AND WHAT HAPPENED TO THE
GUITAR?

22:23.075 --> 22:24.709
OH, THE GUITAR, IT WAS
NOTHING.

22:24.710 --> 22:28.346
IT WAS ME. IT'S MY HANDS.

22:28.347 --> 22:29.714
OH, DON'T LOOK SO FUCKING SAD.

22:29.715 --> 22:31.182
I CAN STILL DO PLENTY OF THINGS,

22:31.183 --> 22:32.383
PROVIDED IT DOESN'T REQUIRE ANY

22:32.384 --> 22:33.785
FINE MOTOR SKILLS.

22:33.786 --> 22:35.620
SHIT, EVEN A ONE-ARMED DUDE
COULD BE A DRUMMER, RIGHT?

22:35.621 --> 22:36.621
YEAH.

22:39.925 --> 22:41.993
SO, WHERE'S THIS GUITAR?

22:51.804 --> 22:52.704
WOW.

22:52.705 --> 22:54.138
YOU LIKE?

22:54.139 --> 22:56.207
SWEET.

23:01.146 --> 23:02.146
IT'S BEEN AWHILE.

23:09.922 --> 23:11.723
I-I WOULD HAVE TO CUT MY NAILS.

23:11.724 --> 23:13.524
JACK, LISTEN TO YOUR MOM.

23:13.525 --> 23:14.926
SHE'S FUCKING ROCKING IT.

23:16.762 --> 23:18.563
HE LIKES YOU.

23:18.564 --> 23:22.066
YEAH, WELL, THAT'S 'CAUSE I
TALK TO HIM, YOU KNOW, LIKE A
REAL PERSON.

23:22.067 --> 23:24.068
MAN TO MAN, ISN'T THAT RIGHT,
MR. JACK?

23:24.069 --> 23:25.370
IT'S THAT SIMPLE, HUH?

23:25.371 --> 23:26.671
IT REALLY... YEAH, I MEAN,

23:26.672 --> 23:28.006
IT'S PRETTY AMAZING WHAT A

23:28.007 --> 23:29.474
STRAIGHTFORWARD CONVERSATION

23:29.475 --> 23:31.542
BETWEEN EQUALS CAN ACCOMPLISH,
YOU KNOW?

23:31.543 --> 23:32.623
MAYBE I SHOULD TRY THAT.

23:35.781 --> 23:37.582
WHERE'D YOU LEARN TO PLAY?

23:37.583 --> 23:38.750
I WAS IN A BAND.

23:38.751 --> 23:40.151
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

23:40.152 --> 23:41.486
YOU WERE IN A BAND?

23:41.487 --> 23:42.353
YES.

23:42.354 --> 23:43.821
WHY DO YOU LOOK SO SURPRISED?

23:43.822 --> 23:46.291
I WASN'T ALWAYS A SUBURBAN
HOUSEWIFE.

23:46.292 --> 23:47.859
I WAS YOUNG AND WILD ONCE.

23:47.860 --> 23:49.560
LET ME GUESS.

23:49.561 --> 23:52.081
YOU WERE IN, LIKE, A MID '90s
KIND OF RIOT-GRRRL BAND TYPE
THING?

23:52.898 --> 23:53.765
WHAT?

23:53.766 --> 23:55.166
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT RIOT

23:55.167 --> 23:56.100
GRRRLS?

23:56.101 --> 23:57.769
IT WAS KIND OF LIKE

23:57.770 --> 23:59.437
SLEATER-KINNEY IN A WAY.

23:59.438 --> 24:00.271
AH.

24:00.272 --> 24:02.040
SO YOU WERE, LIKE, A GUITARIST?

24:02.041 --> 24:04.809
I PLAYED BASS, AND I WROTE
ALL THE LYRICS.

24:04.810 --> 24:07.078
SLEATER-KINNEY DIDN'T HAVE A
BASSIST.

24:07.079 --> 24:08.479
YOU ARE VERY SMART.

24:08.480 --> 24:09.514
NO, THEY DIDN'T.

24:09.515 --> 24:11.816
WE ASPIRED TO BE LIKE
SLEATER-KINNEY.

24:11.817 --> 24:13.484
SO, WHAT WAS YOUR BAND'S
NAME?

24:15.721 --> 24:18.323
WE WERE CALLED WET-NAP.

24:18.324 --> 24:19.457
WET-NAP?

24:21.393 --> 24:24.829
YEAH, WE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
KIND OF GRITTY AND DIRTY, AND WE

24:24.830 --> 24:28.299
LIKED THE FACT THAT IT HAD THE
WORD "WET" IN IT, YOU KNOW.

24:28.300 --> 24:31.803
SO, LIKE WET-NAP, LIKE THE
THING YOU

24:31.804 --> 24:33.504
LIKE AFTER YOU EAT RIBS,
YOU GET A WET

24:33.505 --> 24:36.074
A MOIST TOWELETTE
AND YOU WIPE
YOUR RIBS GREASE?

24:36.075 --> 24:37.075
YEAH, ACTUALLY.

24:39.211 --> 24:41.746
THAT WAS ACTUALLY ONE OF OUR
BIGGEST SONGS.

24:41.747 --> 24:42.747
I'M NOT KIDDING.

24:42.748 --> 24:43.748
WHAT? NO WAY.

24:43.749 --> 24:44.749
IT WAS CALLED

24:44.750 --> 24:46.751
"MOIST TOWELETTE," AND WE WOULD

24:46.752 --> 24:49.992
PLAY IT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE
SHOW, AND THAT'S WHEN EVERYBODY
WOULD LOSE THEIR SHIT.

24:50.923 --> 24:53.224
YOU ARE JERKING MY CHAIN
RIGHT NOW.

24:55.060 --> 24:58.463
WELL, I'D LIKE TO HEAR THAT
SOMETIME.

24:58.464 --> 24:59.864
MAYBE YOU WILL.

25:47.479 --> 25:48.679
 BUT I WON'T MAKE YOU COME IN

25:51.583 --> 25:53.885
AGAIN 

26:19.545 --> 26:22.113
 WITH YOU IS THE ONLY PLACE

26:22.114 --> 26:26.083
WHERE I'VE NEVER FELT ALONE 

26:34.860 --> 26:38.029
 I JUST NEED TO KNOW IF YOU

26:38.030 --> 26:40.131
HEAR ME 

26:40.132 --> 26:41.372
 I JUST NEED TO KNOW IF YOU'RE

26:43.602 --> 26:45.436
LEAVING 

26:45.437 --> 26:47.972
 I JUST NEED TO KNOW THAT

26:47.973 --> 26:53.444
YOU'LL NEVER LET ME GO 

26:54.646 --> 26:56.781
WHAT IS THAT?

26:57.749 --> 26:58.649
ARE YOU GONNA START

26:58.650 --> 27:00.084
BREAK-DANCING FOR ME?

27:00.085 --> 27:01.385
YOU GONNA BREAK-DANCE?

27:01.386 --> 27:02.653
THIS, MY LITTLE MILLENNIAL

27:02.654 --> 27:04.655
SMART ASS, IS A DEVICE USED FOR

27:04.656 --> 27:06.424
PLAYING AN OBSOLETE FORM OF

27:06.425 --> 27:08.659
MUSICAL TECHNOLOGY CALLED THE

27:08.660 --> 27:10.995
CASSETTE TAPE.

27:10.996 --> 27:12.230
OHHH. OKAY.

27:12.231 --> 27:14.599
AND IN THE OLDEN DAYS, BEFORE

27:14.600 --> 27:17.635
MP3s AND ALL THAT GARBAGE, WE

27:17.636 --> 27:20.671
USED THIS AS THE HOMEMADE

27:20.672 --> 27:23.040
RECORDING DEVICE OF CHOICE.

27:23.041 --> 27:24.675
"MOIST TOWELETTE"?

27:24.676 --> 27:26.911
I DON'T KNOW. IS IT?

27:28.013 --> 27:30.648
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

ARE YOU READY?

27:32.017 --> 27:33.017
YEAH. YEAH.

 UNDERNEATH THE BLACK

27:59.945 --> 28:02.046

28:19.464 --> 28:20.584
 I WANT, I WANT, WANT TO BE

28:23.735 --> 28:26.771
YOUR MOIST TOWELETTE 

28:26.772 --> 28:29.240

YEAH.

28:59.538 --> 29:00.738
I CAN'T TALK.

29:00.739 --> 29:02.340
WHAT?

29:02.341 --> 29:05.009
I GUESS WE WERE ALL RIGHT.

29:05.010 --> 29:08.145
ALSO BEFORE THERE WERE BLOGS AND

29:08.146 --> 29:10.314
THE INTERWEBS AND YOU COULDN'T

30:45.811 --> 30:47.845
DO YOU EVEN LIKE DEVILED
EGGS?

30:47.846 --> 30:50.581
HIS FAMILY CAN JUST BE SO
ANNOYING AND 1950s.

30:50.582 --> 30:51.882
I FELT LIKE TAKING IT TO THE

30:51.883 --> 30:54.852

31:00.492 --> 31:03.227
IT'S A BABY. EXCUSE US.

31:04.696 --> 31:06.530
WE MUST LOOK LIKE FREAKS.

31:06.531 --> 31:07.732

31:08.633 --> 31:10.134

31:10.135 --> 31:11.235
AND HIS FAMILY OR WHATEVER

31:11.236 --> 31:12.336
BEFORE YOU GOT MARRIED?

31:12.337 --> 31:14.705
I DIDN'T THINK THEY WOULD BE

31:14.706 --> 31:16.607
SO INVOLVED IN OUR LIVES.

31:16.608 --> 31:18.642
AND I DIDN'T THINK WE'D BE

31:18.643 --> 31:20.878
MOVING HERE, THAT'S FOR SURE.

31:20.879 --> 31:23.013
WHAT ABOUT YOUR PARENTS?

31:23.014 --> 31:24.094
OH, WELL, MY DAD'S DEAD.

31:26.518 --> 31:28.419
SORRY.

31:28.420 --> 31:30.154
WHAT ABOUT YOUR MOM?

31:30.155 --> 31:32.456
WE DON'T SPEAK.

31:32.457 --> 31:34.291
SHE HASN'T MET JACKSON?

31:34.292 --> 31:35.259
NOT YET.

31:35.260 --> 31:37.361
SHE LIVES IN UPSTATE NEW YORK,

31:37.362 --> 31:39.263
AND SHE'S VERY BUSY WHORING

31:39.264 --> 31:42.233

31:42.234 --> 31:43.901
OH, MAN. COUNT ME IN.

31:46.238 --> 31:47.738
THOUGHT I HATED MY PARENTS,

31:47.739 --> 31:48.773
BUT, I MEAN...

31:48.774 --> 31:50.574
CAN WE TALK ABOUT ANYTHING

32:07.325 --> 32:08.526
IT'S FUNNY.

32:08.527 --> 32:10.561
YOU'RE NOT YOUR MOM, THOUGH, YOU
KNOW, I MEAN...

32:13.765 --> 32:15.399
WHAT?

32:15.400 --> 32:17.568

32:17.569 --> 32:20.169
IT'S NOT GONNA BE LIKE THAT FOR
YOU AND JACK, YOU KNOW.

32:27.779 --> 32:30.981
THANK YOU FOR HELPING ME WITH
HIM AND... AND EVERYTHING.

33:14.426 --> 33:15.659
IS THIS AN INTERVENTION?

33:16.595 --> 33:18.128
OF COURSE NOT.

33:18.129 --> 33:20.364

SLEEP-DEPRIVED, OVERWORKED, AND
EXHAUSTED.

33:30.742 --> 33:32.042
SO WE THOUGHT THAT WE COULD

33:32.043 --> 33:33.443
HELP OUT WITH MEALS AND
BABYSITTING.

33:36.381 --> 33:37.815
WE WANTED YOU TO HAVE A

33:37.816 --> 33:39.483

38:39.050 --> 38:39.950
ACCIDENT.

38:39.951 --> 38:40.951
WHAT A BITCH.

38:44.322 --> 38:45.355
YEAH, I MEAN, THIS WAS

38:45.356 --> 38:46.723
BASICALLY HER FAULT.

38:46.724 --> 38:47.858
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

38:47.859 --> 38:49.693
SHE WAS ALWAYS MAKING ME JUMP

38:49.694 --> 38:50.994
THROUGH HOOPS AND DO CRAZY SHIT

38:50.995 --> 38:51.728
FOR HER.

38:51.729 --> 38:53.497
STEALING THESE SIGNS.

38:53.498 --> 38:57.367
YOU KNOW, I WAS SUPPOSED TO
PROVE HOW I FELT ABOUT HER OR
SOMETHING.

38:57.368 --> 39:00.337
ANYWAYS, I WAS PERFORMING WHAT
TURNED OUT TO BE THE LAST OF MY

39:00.338 --> 39:02.072
GRAND GESTURES

39:02.073 --> 39:03.340
WHEN I HAD THE ACCIDENT.

39:03.341 --> 39:05.409
I CLIMBED TO THE TOP OF THIS
WATER TOWER.

39:05.410 --> 39:07.511
YOU KNOW THE ONE ON THE HILL BY
THE OVERPASS?

39:07.512 --> 39:08.478
MM-HMM.

39:08.479 --> 39:09.680
AND, UH, I WAS GONNA PUT HER

39:09.681 --> 39:11.215
NAME ON IT, BUT, I MEAN, NOT

39:11.216 --> 39:12.716
JUST HER NAME... LIKE, THIS

39:12.717 --> 39:13.817
WHOLE MURAL WITH, LIKE,

39:13.818 --> 39:15.285
UNDERGROWTH AND PLANTS AND

39:15.286 --> 39:16.620
LEAVES AND FLOWERS.

39:16.621 --> 39:17.701
IT'S SO COOL UP THERE, MAN.

39:20.692 --> 39:22.392
AND, UH, IT WAS A STATEMENT

39:22.393 --> 39:24.695
ABOUT BAILEY AS THIS LIFE FORCE.

39:24.696 --> 39:26.697
LIKE, UH, THE ELECTRICAL ENERGY

39:26.698 --> 39:27.698
OF WILD-GROWING THINGS.

39:30.702 --> 39:33.637
THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.

39:33.638 --> 39:34.638
YEAH.

39:34.639 --> 39:36.406
WELL, THIS IS HOW SHE MADE ME

39:36.407 --> 39:38.108
FEEL.

39:38.109 --> 39:39.643
AND, UH, I'M 50 FEET ABOVE THE

39:39.644 --> 39:41.044
GROUND SPRAY PAINTING HER NAME,

39:41.045 --> 39:42.412
AND THEN I NEVER FINISHED.

39:42.413 --> 39:43.814
I GOT TO THE WORD "BAIL," WHICH

39:43.815 --> 39:45.382
IS BASICALLY WHAT SHE DID WHEN

39:45.383 --> 39:46.383
SHE FIGURED OUT THE FUCKING

39:46.384 --> 39:48.118
PHYSICAL THERAPY WASN'T GONNA

39:48.119 --> 39:51.421
TAKE.

39:52.757 --> 39:54.825
TO ABSENT FRIENDS.

39:54.826 --> 39:57.394
FUCK 'EM.

39:59.530 --> 40:00.530
FUCK 'EM.

40:03.768 --> 40:05.435
BUT I STILL HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL
WITH HER.

40:05.436 --> 40:07.070
JESUS.

40:08.439 --> 40:12.142
I CAN'T WAIT TILL THIS
GRADUATION SHIT IS OVER!

40:12.143 --> 40:14.077
OH, GOD, YOU MUST HAVE ALL

40:14.078 --> 40:16.146
THAT SENIOR BULLSHIT COMING UP

40:16.147 --> 40:18.215
LIKE WITH THE PAJAMA BREAKFAST

40:18.216 --> 40:19.983
AND AMUSEMENT PARK DAY AND

40:19.984 --> 40:21.285
THE PROM.

40:21.286 --> 40:22.386
WHAT A FARCE.

40:22.387 --> 40:23.420
GOD, PROM.

40:23.421 --> 40:25.422
THERE'S NO WAY I'M ATTENDING
NOW.

40:25.423 --> 40:26.823
WHO'S BAILEY GOING WITH?

40:26.824 --> 40:29.793
MY FORMER BEST FRIEND, ZACK.

40:29.794 --> 40:32.634
I'M SURE THEY'LL TAKE LOVELY
COMMEMORATIVE PHOTOS,
POST THEM ON FACEBOOK.

40:36.000 --> 40:37.901
I REMEMBER MY PROM.

40:37.902 --> 40:40.470
I GOT DUMPED BY MY BOYFRIEND

40:40.471 --> 40:42.439
TWO WEEKS BEFORE, AND, UM, HE

40:42.440 --> 40:45.042
STARTED SEEING THIS GIRL WHO

40:45.043 --> 40:47.210
WOULD WEAR BLACK NAIL POLISH

40:47.211 --> 40:49.446
AFTER I DID, THEN SHE'D SHOW UP

40:49.447 --> 40:51.481
IN THE SAME VANS AFTER I WORE

40:51.482 --> 40:53.717
THEM, AND HE BASICALLY WAS

40:53.718 --> 40:55.398
FALLING FOR THIS LITTLE SLUTTY
COUNTERFEIT.

40:57.188 --> 40:58.622
IT WAS WHATEVER.

40:58.623 --> 41:00.324
AND THEN I, YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T

41:00.325 --> 41:02.125
WANT TO STAY HOME AND FEEL LIKE

41:02.126 --> 41:03.794
A LOSER, SO I ASKED SOMEBODY

41:03.795 --> 41:05.295
OUT, AND IT WAS THIS GUY NAMED

41:05.296 --> 41:05.996
GORDY.

41:05.997 --> 41:06.830
GORDY?

41:06.831 --> 41:08.598
YES. GROOVY GORDY.

41:08.599 --> 41:12.469
GROOVY GORDY WAS THE WEED
CONNECTION ON OUR CAMPUS, SO I

41:12.470 --> 41:14.950
THOUGHT I WAS SORT OF ONE-UPPING
MY BOYFRIEND, BUT IT TURNS OUT

41:17.809 --> 41:19.849
GROOVY GORDY WAS REALLY A
D&D-PLAYING, FANTASY-NOVEL

41:22.613 --> 41:25.053
READING LONER WHO SPENT LOTS OF
TIME IN HIS HEAD, SO WE END UP

41:28.119 --> 41:29.279
AT HIS HOUSE WATCHING THIS...

41:31.856 --> 41:34.358
THIS THING CALLED "ZARDOZ" WHILE

41:34.359 --> 41:36.479
HE'S JUST FUMBLE-Y TRYING TO
UNHOOK MY BRA, AND IT WAS

41:38.363 --> 41:39.363
JUST...

41:42.033 --> 41:42.966
WAIT, WAIT.

41:42.967 --> 41:44.101
WHAT IS "ZARDOZ"?

41:44.102 --> 41:45.836
OH, YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

41:45.837 --> 41:48.872
IT WAS JUST... THE WHOLE THING
WAS A TOTAL DEBACLE.

41:48.873 --> 41:52.109
AND, YOU KNOW, AS FAR AS PROM
GOES, THERE ARE WORSE THINGS

41:52.110 --> 41:55.245
THAN OPTING OUT ENTIRELY.

41:55.246 --> 41:56.880
HMM.

41:56.881 --> 41:59.783
I LIKE THAT, "OPTING OUT."

42:03.154 --> 42:04.394
WELL, IT'S GETTING LATE FOR ME.

42:06.524 --> 42:08.925
OKAY.

42:08.926 --> 42:10.994
IT WAS NICE HANGING.

42:10.995 --> 42:13.363
I GUESS I'LL SEE YOU WHEN I SEE
YOU.

42:13.364 --> 42:14.364
OKAY.

42:14.365 --> 42:16.199
THANKS FOR THE NACHOS,
NACHO LADY.

42:36.988 --> 42:39.022
HEY.

42:39.023 --> 42:41.992
HI.

42:41.993 --> 42:44.027
GOOD NIGHT OUT?

42:44.028 --> 42:46.430
YEAH, IT WAS NICE.

42:46.431 --> 42:50.901
I WAS HOPING THEY'D GET YOU A
LITTLE LIQUORED UP SO I COULD
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOU.

42:55.606 --> 42:56.606
THAT'S SWEET.

42:59.610 --> 43:02.112
WERE YOU BUSY LIGHTING CANDLES?

43:02.113 --> 43:03.647
YEAH.

43:03.648 --> 43:06.088
I JUST, UM, WELL, I WANTED TO
TRY AND MAKE YOU
FEEL SEXY AGAIN.

43:08.352 --> 43:10.187
REALLY?

43:10.188 --> 43:12.255
COME HERE.

43:16.594 --> 43:17.861
HI.

43:17.862 --> 43:19.930
HI.

43:36.647 --> 43:39.249
HMM.

43:39.250 --> 43:42.619
YOU KNOW...

43:42.620 --> 43:45.622
IF YOU'RE STILL TOO SORE DOWN
THERE...

43:45.623 --> 43:49.092
WE COULD DO IT UP THE BUTT.

43:49.093 --> 43:51.561
WHATEVER MAKES YOU FEEL SEXY.

43:55.967 --> 43:58.068
SO, YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE GONNA

43:58.069 --> 44:00.469
PRETEND TO BE ALL SENSITIVE AND
EMOTIONAL AND SHIT, YOU MIGHT

44:02.006 --> 44:04.808
WANT TO LAY OFF THE ANAL-SEX
REQUESTS.

44:05.977 --> 44:07.677
UNLESS YOU JUST TOO CHICKEN SHIT

44:07.678 --> 44:10.278
'CAUSE YOU CAN'T ADMIT YOU SAW
IT IN A VIDEO WITH A
UKRAINIAN GIRL.

44:12.683 --> 44:14.251
HA!

44:14.252 --> 44:16.920
OH, SORRY, I SHOULDN'T SAY ALL

44:16.921 --> 44:19.089
THAT STUFF ABOUT YOUR DAD,

44:19.090 --> 44:21.050
'CAUSE I LOVE YOUR DADDY, AND HE
LOVES YOUR MOMMY.

44:24.061 --> 44:26.062
OH! OH, OH.

44:26.063 --> 44:27.831
OH, GOOD.

44:27.832 --> 44:28.832
IT'S ALL GOOD.

44:30.668 --> 44:33.003
OH, CRAP.

44:36.707 --> 44:37.707
OH, YAY, IT'S MEEMAW.

44:41.112 --> 44:42.712
THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES.

44:42.713 --> 44:44.948
OH, I JUST LOVE IT.

44:44.949 --> 44:46.416
THANK YOU.

44:47.818 --> 44:50.654
YES.

44:52.256 --> 44:53.056
VERY STYLISH.

44:53.057 --> 44:54.724

44:54.725 --> 44:56.693

HEY, BEV.

44:58.029 --> 44:59.029
OH, HEY.

44:59.030 --> 45:01.064
I'VE GOT A SURPRISE FOR YOU.

45:01.065 --> 45:02.065
A SURPRISE?

45:02.066 --> 45:05.569
KELLY, COME MEET MITZI.

45:05.570 --> 45:07.270

45:09.740 --> 45:12.842
I OFFER HEAD-TO-TOE
TRANSFORMATION.

45:19.717 --> 45:22.752
SO, I UNDERSTAND YOU'VE BEEN

45:22.753 --> 45:24.688
FEELING A LITTLE DOWN AND DUMPY
AND HOUSEWIFEY.

45:28.259 --> 45:30.760
LET'S START WITH THAT HAIR.

45:30.761 --> 45:31.728
HOME JOB, I TAKE IT?

45:31.729 --> 45:33.863
YEAH, BUT IT'S MANIC PANIC.

45:33.864 --> 45:34.965
IT'S JUST...

45:34.966 --> 45:37.133
OH, LORD, LIKE THAT OLD
BANGLES SONG.

45:37.134 --> 45:38.768
"JUST ANOTHER MANIC MONDAY"?

45:40.004 --> 45:41.304
I HEAR YOU.

45:41.305 --> 45:43.573
ANYWAY, I THINK IT CAN BE
SALVAGED.

45:43.574 --> 45:47.010
AND WE ALSO BROUGHT ALONG
SOME OUTFITS FOR YOU TO TRY ON.

45:47.011 --> 45:51.781

BEAUTY IN YOU.

45:55.086 --> 45:56.086
SO, SHALL WE GET STARTED?

45:58.756 --> 46:01.091
YES!

46:01.092 --> 46:03.393
OKAY.

46:03.394 --> 46:05.161
I LIKE TRANSFORMING.

46:05.763 --> 46:08.498
CHECK ME OUT.

46:10.301 --> 46:11.701
EAT YOUR HEART OUT.

46:11.702 --> 46:13.203
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

46:13.204 --> 46:14.804
IT'S A DEPRESSED MOMMY

46:14.805 --> 46:15.739
MAKEOVER.

46:15.740 --> 46:17.340
WAS THAT JULIE'S IDEA?

46:17.341 --> 46:18.808
ACTUALLY, IT WAS BEV'S,

46:18.809 --> 46:21.544
BECAUSE, REALLY, WHAT
PSYCHOLOGICAL

46:21.545 --> 46:24.047
PROBLEM/EXISTENTIAL CRISIS CAN'T
BE FIXED WITH A GOOD MAKEOVER?

46:29.320 --> 46:31.621
WELL, YOU... YOU'RE CREEPING
ME OUT.

46:31.622 --> 46:32.922
YOU LOOK LIKE MY MOM.

46:32.923 --> 46:34.391
IS THAT SUCH A BAD THING?

46:34.392 --> 46:35.058
YES.

46:35.059 --> 46:36.259
YES, IT IS A BAD THING.

46:36.260 --> 46:37.594
NO, THINK ABOUT IT.

46:37.595 --> 46:39.663
I COULD SIGN YOUR PERMISSION
SLIPS.

46:39.664 --> 46:42.944
I COULD GET YOU OUT OF THOSE
PESKY SESSIONS WITH THE SCHOOL
COUNSELOR THAT YOU LOVE.

46:44.201 --> 46:46.803
I COULD JUST BAIL YOU OUT OF
CLASS WHENEVER.

46:46.804 --> 46:48.438
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD

46:48.439 --> 46:50.279
AND ALL THAT IS HOLY, PLEASE
CHANGE THAT SHIRT.

46:52.610 --> 46:54.277
HMM.

46:54.278 --> 46:56.846
YOU GOT TO LOSE THOSE
BARRETTES, TOO.

46:56.847 --> 46:58.081
YES, SIR.

47:01.485 --> 47:03.486
YOU KNOW, UH...

47:03.487 --> 47:05.455
IT'S A SHAME ABOUT THAT
TURQUOISE.

47:05.456 --> 47:07.090
IT WAS REALLY GROWING ON ME.

47:07.091 --> 47:08.558
I KNOW. ME, TOO.

47:08.559 --> 47:11.161
BUT YOU CAN'T SOLVE THE BLUES
WITH BLUE HAIR, YOU KNOW.

47:11.162 --> 47:12.429
GOD, DID BEV SAY THAT?

47:12.430 --> 47:15.398
NO, ACTUALLY, THE
TRANSFORMATION LADY SAID IT.

47:15.399 --> 47:16.966
THAT'S AWESOME.

47:16.967 --> 47:19.669
SO, HOW WAS YOUR DAY AT
SCHOOL?

47:19.670 --> 47:21.204
SCHOOL WAS SWELL.

47:21.205 --> 47:22.906
UH...

47:22.907 --> 47:23.640
LET ME SEE.

47:23.641 --> 47:25.175
I PASSED MY CHEM EXAM,

47:25.176 --> 47:26.609
WE WATCHED A VERY
ENLIGHTENING VIDEO ABOUT STDs,

47:26.610 --> 47:29.879
UM, TRIED TO IGNORE ZACK AND
BAILEY INHALING

47:29.880 --> 47:32.615
EACH OTHER'S FACE OFF IN THE
LIBRARY ALL DAY.

47:32.616 --> 47:33.383
FUCK 'EM.

47:33.384 --> 47:35.685
YEAH, FUCK 'EM.

47:35.686 --> 47:37.220
NO PLANS FOR THE EVENING?

47:37.221 --> 47:38.254
NO.

47:38.255 --> 47:39.889
WHAT? NO CANDLELIT DINNER
WITH THE HUBBY?

47:39.890 --> 47:41.324
NO. HE'S AT WORK.

47:41.325 --> 47:43.126
HE'S GONNA BE HOME LATE AGAIN.

47:43.127 --> 47:44.594
HE HAS A VERY BIG DEADLINE.

47:44.595 --> 47:45.595
VERY BIG.

47:45.596 --> 47:48.865
HE WORKS LATE A LOT,
DOESN'T HE?

47:48.866 --> 47:51.201
YEAH, WELL, HE HAS A REALLY
HIGH-PRESSURE JOB.

47:51.202 --> 47:52.762
YOU DON'T THINK HE'S CHEATING
ON YOU?

47:55.139 --> 47:58.308
NO.

47:58.309 --> 48:00.009
THAT'S TOO CLICHé, RIGHT?

48:00.010 --> 48:01.690
PREGNANT WIFE, RIGHT AFTER
THE BABY'S BORN.

48:04.615 --> 48:06.349
LISTEN, I HAVE A QUESTION
FOR YOU.

48:06.350 --> 48:08.251
UM...

48:08.252 --> 48:10.754
DO YOU HAVE A-A NICE DRESS?

48:10.755 --> 48:11.554
A DRESS?

48:11.555 --> 48:12.756
YES. A NICE DRESS.

48:12.757 --> 48:14.224
SOMETHING NICE, YOU KNOW,

48:14.225 --> 48:16.693
YOU WEAR TO FORMAL EVENTS
AND THAT KIND OF THING.

48:16.694 --> 48:18.895
YEAH, 'CAUSE I GO TO A LOT OF
FORMAL EVENTS.

48:20.030 --> 48:21.431
WHY?

48:21.432 --> 48:23.266
BECAUSE I WANT TO TAKE YOU
SOMEWHERE NICE.

48:23.267 --> 48:24.968
WELL, THAT'S SWEET OF YOU.

48:24.969 --> 48:26.536
UNLESS YOU'RE BEING SARCASTIC,

48:26.537 --> 48:27.937
IN WHICH CASE IT'S REALLY MEAN.

48:27.938 --> 48:30.673
NO, NO, NO. I'M NOT.

48:30.674 --> 48:31.941
WHERE ARE YOU GONNA TAKE ME?

48:31.942 --> 48:33.710
CAN'T TELL YOU. SURPRISE.

48:33.711 --> 48:34.944
EXCEPT YOU HAVE TO TELL ME,

48:34.945 --> 48:36.913
OTHERWISE I'M NOT GONNA GO
ANYWHERE.

48:36.914 --> 48:38.248
SURE YOU ARE.

48:38.249 --> 48:40.550
SOUNDS LIKE A REQUIRED TRIP TO,
LIKE, A THRIFT SHOP,

48:40.551 --> 48:42.886
CONSIGNMENT, VINTAGE, WHATEVER
HIPSTERS CALL IT.

48:42.887 --> 48:44.687
HOW NICE OF A DRESS ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

48:44.688 --> 48:47.791
JUST SOMETHING THAT MAKES YOU
FEEL PRETTY AND FANCY.

48:47.792 --> 48:50.860
I'M NOT GOING TO YOUR PROM,
CAL.

48:50.861 --> 48:52.262
FUCK THE PROM.

48:52.263 --> 48:52.929
SO?

48:52.930 --> 48:55.131
SO?

48:55.132 --> 48:58.852
BUY A DRESS, SOMETHING YOUNG AND
SEXY AND NOT MOMMYISH, NOT THAT
MOMMIES AREN'T SEXY SOMETIMES.

48:58.969 --> 49:00.470
NO, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

49:00.471 --> 49:02.071
I'M NOT GOING TO YOUR PROM.

49:02.072 --> 49:04.007
JUST BUY THE DAMN DRESS,
OKAY?

49:04.008 --> 49:05.608
IT'S FOR SPECIAL TEENS AWARDS.

49:05.609 --> 49:06.676
SPECIAL TEENS?

49:06.677 --> 49:07.710
SPECIAL TEENS.

49:07.711 --> 49:09.946
YOU'VE BEEN NOMINATED BEST NEW
MENTOR.

49:09.947 --> 49:13.067
I WAS GONNA GIVE YOU MENTOR OF
THE YEAR, BUT, YOU KNOW, IT
SEEMED LIKE OVERKILL.

49:15.786 --> 49:17.754
OH, YOU'RE SPECIAL, ALL RIGHT.

49:17.755 --> 49:19.522
JUST BUY THE DAMN DRESS,

49:19.523 --> 49:21.758
OKAY?

49:21.759 --> 49:23.827
OKAY.

49:53.357 --> 49:54.757
Hello?

49:54.758 --> 49:56.626
HI. IT'S ME.

49:56.627 --> 49:59.262
Hey, is everything all right?

49:59.263 --> 50:00.029
YEAH.

50:00.030 --> 50:03.032
I WAS JUST CALLING TO SAY HI.

50:03.033 --> 50:04.033
Oh. Well, hi, you.

50:06.937 --> 50:08.371
HI.

50:08.372 --> 50:12.442
The baby sleeping okay?

50:12.443 --> 50:14.724
YEAH, HE FOUGHT IT FOR A
LITTLE BIT, BUT NOW HE'S DOWN.

50:16.380 --> 50:20.383
Good, good.

50:20.384 --> 50:23.052
SO, YOU GONNA BE THERE LATE
AGAIN TONIGHT?

50:23.053 --> 50:24.354
Yeah, unfortunately.

50:24.355 --> 50:25.388
Definitely don't wait up.

50:25.389 --> 50:28.091
You should get some sleep while
you can.

50:31.295 --> 50:32.295
OKAY.

50:35.165 --> 50:37.033
BYE.

50:49.713 --> 50:50.780
WE MADE PIE!

50:50.781 --> 50:53.049
THOUGHT THE KIDS MIGHT LIKE
IT.

50:53.050 --> 50:53.983
WHAT KIDS?

50:53.984 --> 50:55.818
THE SPECIAL TEENS, YOU KNOW.

50:55.819 --> 50:57.720
OH, I'M NOT DOING THAT TODAY.

50:57.721 --> 50:58.521
WHY NOT?

50:58.522 --> 51:00.123
AREN'T YOU FEELING OKAY?

51:00.124 --> 51:01.491
YOU LOOK OKAY TO ME.

51:01.492 --> 51:04.093
NO, I'M... I'M NOT FEELING UP
TO IT.

51:04.094 --> 51:05.061
THAT WAS FAST.

51:05.062 --> 51:05.862
WHAT?

51:05.863 --> 51:07.063
THE NOVELTY WEAR OFF?

51:07.064 --> 51:07.931
NO.

51:07.932 --> 51:09.732
DO YOU THINK THAT THEY FEEL

51:09.733 --> 51:11.067
LIKE BEING IN A WHEELCHAIR OR

51:11.068 --> 51:12.835
HAVING A SEEING EYE DOG OR

51:12.836 --> 51:14.537
SERVICE MONKEY OR WHATEVER THEIR

51:14.538 --> 51:16.339
UNFORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE?

51:16.340 --> 51:17.607
THEY DON'T GOT A CHOICE.

51:17.608 --> 51:20.076
SHE'S NOT SAYING SHE'LL NEVER
GO AGAIN.

51:20.077 --> 51:21.411
SHE JUST NEEDS A DAY OFF.

51:21.412 --> 51:24.547
RIGHT. THAT'S...

51:24.548 --> 51:26.788
YOU KNOW, WE DON'T WANT TO
LET A GOOD PIE GO TO WASTE.

51:28.218 --> 51:29.152
RIGHT, KELLY?

51:29.153 --> 51:30.153
YEAH, OKAY.

51:30.154 --> 51:32.889
I'LL GET US PLATES.

51:32.890 --> 51:34.857
MAKE IT A CHOCOLATE CREAM
PIE!

51:34.858 --> 51:36.926
TWIST MY ARM!

51:51.709 --> 51:54.944
EVERYBODY ALWAYS MAKES IT
SOUND LIKE IT'S OUR FAULT, LIKE

51:54.945 --> 51:56.379
WE'RE THESE TERRIBLE

51:56.380 --> 51:59.082
CAREER-OBSESSED WOMEN TOO
SELFISH TO STOP AND HAVE KIDS

51:59.083 --> 52:00.283
UNTIL IT'S TOO LATE.

52:01.752 --> 52:04.153
WHAT ABOUT THE MAN CHILDREN IN
THEIR LATE 30s BLOWING HUGE

52:04.154 --> 52:06.589
CHUNKS OF THEIR LIFE PLAYING
GRAND THEFT AUTO?

52:06.590 --> 52:08.658
WHY DON'T THEY ANALYZE THAT
TREND?

52:08.659 --> 52:10.994
YOU SHOULD GO OUT WITH AN
OLDER MAN.

52:10.995 --> 52:13.563
THEY HAVE A MUCH LONGER SHELF
LIFE THAN WE DO.

52:13.564 --> 52:14.964
DON'T BE DISGUSTING.

52:14.965 --> 52:16.599
NO, I THINK BEV HAS A POINT.

52:16.600 --> 52:17.800
WHO'S THAT OLD GUY?

52:17.801 --> 52:18.701
TONY RANDALL?

52:18.702 --> 52:20.403
HE'S STILL PUMPING OUT KIDS.

52:20.404 --> 52:21.938
HE'S DEAD, KELLY.

52:21.939 --> 52:24.273
YOU KNOW, IT TAKES MEN A LOT
LONGER TO GROW UP THAN WE DO.

52:24.274 --> 52:25.274
THAT'S A FACT.

52:25.275 --> 52:26.109
WHY?

52:26.110 --> 52:27.176
BECAUSE WE LET THEM.

52:27.177 --> 52:30.313
BECAUSE GROWING UP IS
ACTUALLY REALLY PAINFUL

52:30.314 --> 52:32.554
AND WOMEN HAVE A STRONGER
THRESHOLD FOR PAIN, SUPPOSEDLY.

52:35.319 --> 52:38.354
WE CAN'T ALL BE ADOLESCENT
NARCISSISTS.

52:41.792 --> 52:43.226
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

52:43.227 --> 52:45.161
TO PUT ON SOME COFFEE AND SO

52:45.162 --> 52:46.996
I DON'T HAVE TO LISTEN TO YOU.

52:46.997 --> 52:48.998
NASTY.

52:56.140 --> 52:57.900
IT'S SO EASY FOR YOU TO BE
SMUG, ISN'T IT?

53:00.544 --> 53:03.613
YOU HAVE EVERYTHING I WANT.

53:07.217 --> 53:08.417
YOU SHOULD BE SO HAPPY, KELLY.

53:11.221 --> 53:13.489
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

53:17.194 --> 53:19.262
I DON'T KNOW.

53:33.210 --> 53:34.077
OH, HEY.

53:34.078 --> 53:36.212
HEY, LADY. NEED A RIDE?

53:36.213 --> 53:37.013
HOP IN.

53:37.014 --> 53:39.482
OKAY.

53:39.483 --> 53:40.550
NICE WHEELS.

53:40.551 --> 53:42.218
I WANTED A FIREBIRD, BUT, UH,

53:42.219 --> 53:44.654
THIS IS MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE AND
SAFER.

53:44.655 --> 53:48.024
MY PARENTS HAVE NO FUCKING SENSE
OF IRONY.

53:50.294 --> 53:52.161
YOU GOT IT THIS TIME.

54:13.150 --> 54:13.883
WHAT?

54:13.884 --> 54:14.884
NOTHING.

54:15.586 --> 54:16.252
CAL.

54:16.253 --> 54:16.986
WHAT?

54:16.987 --> 54:17.987
CAL.

54:19.256 --> 54:20.590
YOU JACKASS!

54:20.591 --> 54:22.058
IT'S A VOLVO.

54:22.059 --> 54:25.128
IT'S COMPLETELY SAFE, REMEMBER?

54:31.535 --> 54:33.669
WOW. THERE'S LIKE NO ONE HERE.

54:33.670 --> 54:34.837
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

54:34.838 --> 54:36.339
WE TIMED IT PERFECTLY.

54:36.340 --> 54:39.275
TOO LATE FOR THE LUNCH RUSH, TOO
EARLY FOR THE EARLY BIRDS, WAY

54:39.276 --> 54:40.943
TOO EARLY FOR THE NIGHT OWLS.

54:40.944 --> 54:42.645
OKAY, SO WHAT'S GOOD HERE?

54:42.646 --> 54:44.347
WELL, UM, ACTUALLY, CAN WE

54:44.348 --> 54:47.850
JUST HAVE TWO ORDERS OF
FRENCH FRIES WITH GRAVY,

54:47.851 --> 54:51.287
TWO CHERRY COKES,
EXTRA SYRUP, AND $5 IN QUARTERS,
SAME AS ALWAYS?

54:52.289 --> 54:53.769
I GUESS THAT'S WHAT I'LL BE
HAVING.

54:57.828 --> 54:59.462
SHE USED TO BE MY BABYSITTER.

54:59.463 --> 55:00.563
REALLY?
YEAH.

55:00.564 --> 55:02.298
SHE DIDN'T EVEN LOOK YOU IN
THE EYE.

55:02.299 --> 55:03.099
YEAH, I KNOW.

55:03.100 --> 55:05.434
NOBODY DOES.

55:05.435 --> 55:08.905
EXCEPT FOR YOU.

55:08.906 --> 55:11.274
OKAY, SO WHAT'S WITH THE
QUARTERS?

55:13.277 --> 55:16.145
THIS GOES ALL THE WAY BACK TO
THE '80s.

55:16.146 --> 55:18.181
IT'S WHEN YOU WERE IN HIGH
SCHOOL, RIGHT?

55:18.182 --> 55:19.949
SHUT UP.

55:19.950 --> 55:21.117
OH, MY GOD.

55:21.118 --> 55:23.486
I REMEMBER ALL THESE SONGS.

55:27.591 --> 55:29.759
DID YOU GET THE DRESS?

55:29.760 --> 55:31.594
THE DRESS?

55:31.595 --> 55:32.728
YOU KNOW. THE DRESS.

55:32.729 --> 55:33.696
NO, I DON'T KNOW.

55:33.697 --> 55:34.797
WHAT ARE YOU... WHAT...

55:34.798 --> 55:36.132
COME ON, YOU KNOW EXACTLY

55:36.133 --> 55:37.266
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

55:37.267 --> 55:38.668
DON'T DO THIS.

55:38.669 --> 55:40.069
YES, I GOT A DRESS.

55:40.070 --> 55:41.103
OKAY.

55:41.104 --> 55:42.872
A REALLY KICK-ASS ONE,
ACTUALLY.

55:42.873 --> 55:44.340
WHAT'S IT LOOK LIKE?

55:44.341 --> 55:45.608
I'M NOT TELLING YOU.

55:45.609 --> 55:47.677
THAT'LL BE <i>MY</i> SURPRISE.

55:52.416 --> 55:53.282
[ CYNDI LAUPER'S

55:53.283 --> 55:54.617
[ "ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT" PLAYS ]

55:55.385 --> 55:57.353
NICE.

56:02.392 --> 56:03.872
 I'LL BE AWAKE AND I'LL BE WITH
YOU 

56:20.510 --> 56:21.510
HELLO!

56:22.980 --> 56:23.713
HEY.

56:23.714 --> 56:24.914
WOW, THAT SMELLS GOOD.

56:24.915 --> 56:26.249
YOU'RE HOME EARLY.

56:26.250 --> 56:27.617
MM-HMM.

56:27.618 --> 56:30.319
MOM SAID SHE MADE LASAGNA, AND I
WASN'T GONNA MISS THAT.

56:30.320 --> 56:31.187
OF COURSE.

56:31.188 --> 56:32.855
SHE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT THAT.

56:32.856 --> 56:33.723
SWEET.

56:33.724 --> 56:35.324
SO, I'LL JUST GO CHANGE, AND

56:35.325 --> 56:36.325
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK DOWN.

56:39.563 --> 56:40.563
MOM'S LASAGNA.

56:43.166 --> 56:46.736
MMM.

56:46.737 --> 56:48.817
HAS IT BEEN HELPFUL HAVING HER
AND, UM, JULIE AROUND?

56:50.874 --> 56:53.743
YEAH.

56:53.744 --> 56:55.411
HOW'D YOU GET ON THAT WHOLE,

56:55.412 --> 56:58.214
UM, HELPING THE HANDICAPPED
THING?

56:58.215 --> 56:59.749
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

56:59.750 --> 57:02.351
I THINK I JUST FELT BAD ABOUT,

57:02.352 --> 57:03.952
UM, YELLING AT THE KID IN THE
WHEELCHAIR.

57:11.561 --> 57:13.829
I'LL SEE.

57:17.000 --> 57:18.000
HI.

57:18.001 --> 57:19.101
HEY.

57:35.786 --> 57:37.320

I DID FORGET.

57:38.422 --> 57:40.056

57:40.057 --> 57:41.897
MISS COOPER IS PROBABLY TOO
MODEST TO TELL YOU,

57:44.061 --> 57:46.462
BUT SHE'S BEEN NOMINATED
FOR BEST NEW MENTOR.

57:47.898 --> 57:49.832
OH, WOW.

57:49.833 --> 57:51.534
THAT'S TONIGHT?

57:51.535 --> 57:53.736

57:53.737 --> 57:56.105
OKAY, UH, I'LL... I'LL GO GET

HEY, THANKS.

58:01.244 --> 58:05.114
SURE.

58:05.115 --> 58:07.483
I WAS COMING HOME LATE FROM
SCHOOL ONE NIGHT.

58:07.484 --> 58:10.820
WE WERE WORKING HARD ON OUR
HARVARD MODEL U.N. DEBATE.

58:10.821 --> 58:12.855
MY TEAM WAS ARGUING IN FAVOR OF

58:12.856 --> 58:16.296
MICROLOANS FOR PHYSICALLY ABUSED
PAKISTANI WOMEN TO START THEIR
OWN CANDLE-MAKING CO-OP.

58:20.297 --> 58:23.177
WE LEFT HIGH-FIVING EACH
OTHER, WALKING ON AIR,
SURE THAT WE WOULD WIN.

58:25.569 --> 58:27.236
HMM.

58:27.237 --> 58:29.505
BUT...

58:29.506 --> 58:32.074
I NEVER MADE THAT DEBATE.

58:33.543 --> 58:36.223
A DRUNK DRIVER PLOWED ACROSS THE
DIVIDER AND CHANGED MY LIFE
FOREVER.

58:38.548 --> 58:40.116
SHIT.

58:40.117 --> 58:41.851
YOU KNOW WHAT, THOUGH?

58:41.852 --> 58:43.886
THANKS TO THE HARD WORK OF MY

58:43.887 --> 58:46.607
TEAM, THAT CO-OP HAS HELPED OVER
300 WOMEN CHANGE THEIR LIVES

58:54.965 --> 58:56.532
OH, COOL. THANKS, MAN.

59:04.941 --> 59:07.276

59:08.812 --> 59:12.281
OKAY. READY.

59:12.282 --> 59:15.551
OH, MISS... MISS COOPER,

59:40.510 --> 59:41.811
AND WHAT WAS THAT IN THERE?

59:41.812 --> 59:43.145
THANKS FOR THE WARNING.

59:43.146 --> 59:44.747
THE WHOLE THING'S
SUPPOSED TO
BE A SURPRISE.

59:44.748 --> 59:45.915
COULD YOU PLEASE JUST...

59:45.916 --> 59:47.183
OH. SORRY.
DON'T PUSH ME.

59:47.184 --> 59:47.917
I HATE THAT SHIT.

WHOO!

01:00:21.985 --> 01:00:24.053
OH, SHIT.

01:00:27.757 --> 01:00:31.093
GET BACK IN.

01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:51.180
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

01:00:54.651 --> 01:00:56.051
DOES IT LOOK LIKE I'M

01:00:56.052 --> 01:00:57.052
KIDDING YOU?

01:00:59.656 --> 01:01:03.058

SHOULDER AND YOUR BRA STRAP ALL

01:14:58.027 --> 01:14:59.260
HANGING OUT.

01:15:01.864 --> 01:15:03.264
HE USED TO BE AN ARTIST LIKE
YOU.

01:15:05.768 --> 01:15:06.534
YEAH.

01:15:06.535 --> 01:15:07.535
USED TO BE.

01:15:10.373 --> 01:15:13.308
AND HE USED TO DRAW...

01:15:13.309 --> 01:15:15.877
LIKE YOU.

01:15:15.878 --> 01:15:18.278
YEAH, WELL, GONNA BECOME A
CORPORATE SELLOUT LIKE ME, TOO?

01:15:22.118 --> 01:15:23.585
NO.

01:15:23.586 --> 01:15:28.490
HE HAD A SPINAL INJURY AND LOST
ALL HIS FINE MOTOR FUNCTION.

01:15:30.159 --> 01:15:31.893
HE CAN'T DRAW?

01:15:35.598 --> 01:15:37.866
OKAY, THAT SUCKS.

01:15:37.867 --> 01:15:39.801
YEAH.

01:15:39.802 --> 01:15:41.236
YEAH, IT DOES.

01:15:44.707 --> 01:15:46.141
SO, WHAT'D YOU THINK?

01:15:46.142 --> 01:15:47.976
MAYBE SOME SHITTY POTTERY MIGHT

01:15:47.977 --> 01:15:48.977
CHEER HIM UP?

01:15:49.578 --> 01:15:51.713
FUCK YOU.

01:15:51.714 --> 01:15:52.580
KELLY.

01:15:52.581 --> 01:15:54.549
KELLY, I WAS JUST KIDDING.

01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:56.818
JESUS CHRIST. COME ON!

01:16:13.102 --> 01:16:14.569
WHAT IS THAT?

01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:15.937
A CADAVER?

01:16:15.938 --> 01:16:18.006
IT'S YOUR SOMETHING ELSE.

01:16:21.977 --> 01:16:23.511
IT STINKS.

01:16:23.512 --> 01:16:30.385
I WANT YOU TO TAKE THIS CLAY
AND JUST PUT IT IN YOUR HANDS.

01:16:33.622 --> 01:16:36.958
FIRST LESSON... THE COIL POT.

01:16:36.959 --> 01:16:40.595
YOU TAKE A PIECE OF CLAY LIKE
THIS.

01:16:40.596 --> 01:16:42.596
YOU CAN SQUEEZE IT AND MAKE A
SNAKE-LIKE FORMATION.

01:16:45.367 --> 01:16:47.001
AND THEN...

01:16:47.002 --> 01:16:50.171
YOU JUST WRAP IT OR COIL IT
AROUND ITSELF.

01:16:53.609 --> 01:16:55.477
IT'S REALLY SIMPLE.

01:16:55.478 --> 01:16:58.478
NO FINE MOTOR SKILLS ARE
REQUIRED, AND YOU CAN MAKE
YOURSELF A GREAT ASHTRAY.

01:17:01.083 --> 01:17:02.784
THOUGHT YOU WERE QUITTING.

01:17:02.785 --> 01:17:06.154
YEAH, I AM, BUT YOU DON'T
HAVE TO.

01:17:06.155 --> 01:17:07.155
DON'T WATCH.

01:17:10.025 --> 01:17:12.093
OKAY.

01:17:18.667 --> 01:17:21.369
WHERE'D YOU LEARN THIS
PROFOUNDLY USEFUL SKILL?

01:17:21.370 --> 01:17:24.072
"EXPRESSIONS IN THREE
DIMENSIONS."

01:17:24.073 --> 01:17:25.640
IT WAS MY ELECTIVE.

01:17:25.641 --> 01:17:27.709
AWESOME.

01:17:27.710 --> 01:17:29.377
IT'S WHERE I MET JOSH.

01:17:30.379 --> 01:17:32.981
YOU MET JOSH IN ART CLASS?

01:17:35.117 --> 01:17:36.017
YEP.

01:17:36.018 --> 01:17:38.019
HE WAS AN ART MAJOR.

01:17:40.322 --> 01:17:41.990
HE WAS AN ART MAJOR?

01:17:41.991 --> 01:17:44.492
WHY ARE YOU ACTING SO
SHOCKED?

01:17:44.493 --> 01:17:46.327
HAVE YOU SEEN THE GUY?

01:17:46.328 --> 01:17:48.528
HE'S LIKE A POSTER BOY FOR
FUCKING ABERCROMBIE & DOUCHE.

01:17:50.399 --> 01:17:51.733
NO, HE ISN'T.

01:17:51.734 --> 01:17:54.702
AND HE HAS TO DRESS LIKE THAT
FOR WORK.

01:17:54.703 --> 01:17:56.137
HE'S IN ADVERTISING.

01:17:56.138 --> 01:17:57.672
OH, THAT MAKES SENSE.

01:17:57.673 --> 01:18:01.276
YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY MAKES
COMPROMISES, CAL.

01:18:01.277 --> 01:18:03.444
WE ALL HAVE TO MAKE SACRIFICES

01:18:03.445 --> 01:18:05.713
IN LIFE, AND SOMETIMES EVEN WHEN

01:18:05.714 --> 01:18:08.683
YOU DO ALL THAT AND YOU PLAY BY

01:18:08.684 --> 01:18:10.652
THE RULES, THINGS STILL DON'T

01:18:10.653 --> 01:18:12.013
TURN OUT LIKE YOU
EXPECTED THEM TO.

01:18:14.557 --> 01:18:16.858
I'M DONE.

01:18:16.859 --> 01:18:18.293
CAN I LOOK?

01:18:18.294 --> 01:18:19.994
MM-HMM.

01:18:24.066 --> 01:18:25.733
IT'S NOT QUITE TO SCALE.

01:18:25.734 --> 01:18:28.403
I'M A LITTLE BIT BIGGER.

01:18:48.757 --> 01:18:50.792
ASSHOLE.

01:18:50.793 --> 01:18:51.726
I'M AN ASSHOLE?

01:18:51.727 --> 01:18:53.394
YEAH!

01:18:53.395 --> 01:18:56.297
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO TURNED
INTO MOTHER FUCKING TERESA
OVERNIGHT.

01:18:56.298 --> 01:18:57.865
I'M JUST DOING MY BEST.

01:18:57.866 --> 01:18:59.100
I'M... I'M JUST TRYING.

01:18:59.101 --> 01:19:02.103
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO?

01:19:02.104 --> 01:19:03.905
HELP ME ADJUST TO MY NEW LIFE?

01:19:03.906 --> 01:19:05.506
HELP ME CONTRIBUTE TO SOCIETY?

01:19:05.507 --> 01:19:08.476
I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY FUCKING
FRIEND!

01:19:08.477 --> 01:19:10.111
I AM.

01:19:10.112 --> 01:19:11.713
THEN QUIT JERKING ME AROUND

01:19:11.714 --> 01:19:12.747
WITH THIS ART-THERAPY SHIT.

01:19:12.748 --> 01:19:14.549
I DON'T NEED YOUR FUCKING PITY,

01:19:14.550 --> 01:19:16.017
OKAY?

01:19:16.018 --> 01:19:17.785
AND A FUCKING ASHTRAY ISN'T
GONNA MAKE MY LIFE WORTH LIVING.

01:19:17.786 --> 01:19:21.589
SO IF YOU NEED SOME SHORT,
LITTLE PROJECT TO MAKE
YOUR LIFE WORTH LIVING,

01:19:21.590 --> 01:19:24.292
WHY DON'T YOU GO TO THE GYM
AND REHABILITATE YOUR DRAGGY,

01:19:24.293 --> 01:19:26.828
FUCKING USED-UP,
OLD, NASTY ASS,

01:19:26.829 --> 01:19:30.498
THEN MAYBE YOUR
HUSBAND WOULD FUCK YOU!

01:19:54.590 --> 01:19:56.658
HELLO?

01:22:05.888 --> 01:22:07.955
HELLO?

01:22:14.363 --> 01:22:15.363
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:18.766
HI.

01:22:18.767 --> 01:22:21.302
I WAS JUST GONNA TAKE A BATH.

01:22:21.303 --> 01:22:22.203
WAIT.

01:22:22.204 --> 01:22:24.272
WHAT?

01:22:32.014 --> 01:22:34.081
WHAT'S THIS?

01:22:34.082 --> 01:22:35.082
IT'S AN APOLOGY FOR...

01:22:38.020 --> 01:22:40.087
EVERYTHING.

01:22:45.828 --> 01:22:47.548
I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I
HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN.

01:22:49.965 --> 01:22:52.967
HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN WHO YOU ARE,

01:22:52.968 --> 01:22:55.102
WHY I FELL IN LOVE WITH YOU.

01:23:00.909 --> 01:23:02.777
WHAT'S WRONG?

01:23:02.778 --> 01:23:04.378
YOU DON'T LIKE IT?

01:23:04.379 --> 01:23:06.047
NO. IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

01:23:09.318 --> 01:23:10.384
KELLY.

01:23:16.558 --> 01:23:19.794
KEL.

01:23:21.330 --> 01:23:24.966
ARE YOU OKAY?

01:23:24.967 --> 01:23:28.402
LOOK, KELLY, I WANT TO MAKE YOU
HAPPY, BUT I...

01:23:28.403 --> 01:23:30.404
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

01:23:34.042 --> 01:23:37.278
YOU KNOW, I'M NEW TO THIS,
TOO.

01:23:37.279 --> 01:23:39.347
I'M TRYING.

01:23:49.157 --> 01:23:51.959
WELL, I'M GOING TO BED.

01:24:32.801 --> 01:24:35.336
HEY.

01:24:35.337 --> 01:24:36.904
HEY.

01:24:40.075 --> 01:24:42.109
HEY.

01:24:47.516 --> 01:24:48.849
YEAH. I KNOW.

01:24:52.054 --> 01:24:54.088
SHHH.

01:24:54.089 --> 01:24:55.089
SHHH.

01:24:57.893 --> 01:25:00.094
SHHH.

01:25:22.084 --> 01:25:23.084
THANKS, BEV.

01:25:23.085 --> 01:25:24.585
OH, YOU'RE WELCOME.

01:25:24.586 --> 01:25:26.487
ANYTHING INTERESTING?

01:25:26.488 --> 01:25:27.188
THIS.

01:25:27.189 --> 01:25:27.955
FANCY.

01:25:27.956 --> 01:25:29.256
MRS. KELLY COOPER.

01:25:29.257 --> 01:25:31.092
LET ME SEE.

01:25:31.093 --> 01:25:33.928
SPECIAL TEEN INITIATIVE.

01:25:33.929 --> 01:25:36.130
IS THAT FROM THE YOUNG MAN
YOU WERE MENTORING?

01:25:36.131 --> 01:25:39.166
I THINK SO.

01:25:39.167 --> 01:25:41.268
WHAT'S IT SAY?

01:25:41.269 --> 01:25:48.142
IT SAYS "YOU ARE INVITED
TO A SPECIAL EXHIBITION
THIS SATURDAY."

01:25:52.114 --> 01:25:53.314
WELL, WELL, WELL.

01:25:53.315 --> 01:25:55.816
LOOK WHO CAME BACK FOR ANOTHER
POTTERY LESSON.

01:25:55.817 --> 01:25:58.753
I CAN'T SEE YOU ANYMORE.

01:25:58.754 --> 01:25:59.954
WHAT?

01:25:59.955 --> 01:26:03.224
UM, THIS THING...

01:26:03.225 --> 01:26:06.160
THAT WE HAVE BETWEEN US,
IT WAS WRONG.

01:26:06.161 --> 01:26:08.696
AND I KNOW IT'S MY FAULT, AND I

01:26:08.697 --> 01:26:11.032
SHOULDN'T HAVE, UH, LET IT GO AS

01:26:11.033 --> 01:26:12.299
FAR AS IT DID.

01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:15.436
AND I... THOUGHT WE WERE BEING
FRIENDS.

01:26:15.437 --> 01:26:17.038
THAT'S WHAT I TOLD MYSELF.

01:26:17.039 --> 01:26:18.739
BUT I... WE HAVE TO JUST...

01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:20.007
YOU'RE SERIOUS.

01:26:20.008 --> 01:26:23.210
I HAVE A HUSBAND,
AND I HAVE A BABY.

01:26:23.211 --> 01:26:26.447
AND I'M LIKE TWICE YOUR AGE.

01:26:26.448 --> 01:26:28.015
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE A GROWNUP.

01:26:28.016 --> 01:26:29.650
I-I SHOULDN'T HAVE EVER LET IT

01:26:29.651 --> 01:26:30.951
GET AS FAR AS IT DID.

01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:32.987
WHAT'S THAT?

01:26:32.988 --> 01:26:36.157
I CAN'T HEAR YOU.

01:26:36.158 --> 01:26:38.159
SPEAK UP!

01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:40.795
I'M SORRY!

01:26:40.796 --> 01:26:42.029
I'M SORRY!

01:26:42.030 --> 01:26:44.098
DON'T!

01:27:15.697 --> 01:27:17.064
HOW ARE YOU?

01:27:17.065 --> 01:27:18.265
HOW'S EVERYBODY?

01:27:18.266 --> 01:27:19.633
HOW ARE YOU?

01:27:59.074 --> 01:28:01.308
SO, YOU GONNA GO TO THAT

01:28:01.309 --> 01:28:02.910
ART-SHOW THING?

01:28:02.911 --> 01:28:04.278
HMM?

01:28:04.279 --> 01:28:06.947
THAT SPECIAL-TEEN THING?

01:28:11.553 --> 01:28:12.553
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE.

01:28:15.924 --> 01:28:18.325
SO, HE'S STILL DOING ART,
HUH?

01:28:18.326 --> 01:28:20.060
I MEAN, 'CAUSE OF YOU?

01:28:20.061 --> 01:28:21.061
YEAH.

01:28:24.299 --> 01:28:25.966
WELL, GUESS I WAS WRONG ABOUT

01:28:25.967 --> 01:28:28.035
THAT SHITTY POTTERY.

01:28:32.707 --> 01:28:34.742
KIDDING.

01:28:34.743 --> 01:28:37.144
NOW, UM...

01:28:37.145 --> 01:28:39.113
ACTUALLY, I THINK IT'S PRETTY

01:28:39.114 --> 01:28:40.314
COOL.

01:28:40.315 --> 01:28:42.115
YOU, UH, REALLY MADE A
DIFFERENCE IN HIS LIFE.

01:28:44.352 --> 01:28:46.420
THANKS.

01:29:42.911 --> 01:29:44.378
DO YOU LIKE IT?

01:29:44.379 --> 01:29:46.013
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

01:29:46.014 --> 01:29:48.782
HERE AND THERE.

01:29:48.783 --> 01:29:50.417
I HAD TO GET READY FOR THE SHOW,

01:29:50.418 --> 01:29:51.698
FIND A KILN,
GET IT ALL FIRED UP.

01:29:54.756 --> 01:29:57.258
WHAT IS THAT DOING HERE WITH
MY NAME ON IT?

01:29:57.259 --> 01:29:58.759
HOPEFULLY WINNING THE GRAND

01:29:58.760 --> 01:30:00.861
JURY PRIZE IN THE ART SHOW FOR
RETARDS.

01:30:00.862 --> 01:30:02.863
MIGHT WANT TO UNHAND ME,
BY THE WAY.

01:30:02.864 --> 01:30:04.465
YOU'RE BASICALLY ASSAULTING A

01:30:04.466 --> 01:30:05.966
HANDICAPPED TEENAGER IN PUBLIC

01:30:05.967 --> 01:30:08.035
RIGHT NOW.

01:30:11.339 --> 01:30:13.807
THAT WAS A PRIVATE MOMENT.

01:30:13.808 --> 01:30:15.442
THAT'S BETTER.

01:30:15.443 --> 01:30:17.378
NOW IT JUST SEEMS LIKE WE'RE

01:30:17.379 --> 01:30:19.446
HAVING A LOVER'S SPAT.

01:30:26.288 --> 01:30:28.589
STOP PUSHING ME, ALL RIGHT?

01:30:28.590 --> 01:30:29.423
THAT WAS BETWEEN US.

01:30:29.424 --> 01:30:30.758
THERE IS NO "US."

01:30:30.759 --> 01:30:32.760
I-I-I THINK YOU MADE THAT VERY
CLEAR.

01:30:32.761 --> 01:30:34.828
THAT MOMENT, I DID IT BECAUSE

01:30:34.829 --> 01:30:36.797
I WAS WORRIED ABOUT YOU, AND I

01:30:36.798 --> 01:30:38.699
DIDN'T WANT YOU SLIPPING AWAY

01:30:38.700 --> 01:30:40.801
AND OPTING OUT, AND I WANTED YOU

01:30:40.802 --> 01:30:42.002
TO STOP FEELING SORRY FOR

01:30:42.003 --> 01:30:43.971
YOURSELF AND START LIVING.

01:30:43.972 --> 01:30:45.406
WRONG.

01:30:45.407 --> 01:30:47.007
YOU FELT SORRY FOR YOURSELF AND
YOU WERE JERKING ME AROUND

01:30:47.008 --> 01:30:48.575
SO YOU COULD GET
MORE FUCKING ATTENTION.

01:30:48.576 --> 01:30:49.777
IT'S NOT TRUE.
COME ON.

01:30:49.778 --> 01:30:51.412
JUST COME OUT AND SAY IT,
ALL RIGHT?

01:30:51.413 --> 01:30:53.447
YOU'RE A BIG FUCKING COCK TEASE!

01:30:54.482 --> 01:30:56.050
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:30:56.051 --> 01:30:56.850
CAL.

01:30:56.851 --> 01:30:58.485
I'M SO SORRY.

01:30:58.486 --> 01:31:01.889
I-I-I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT WOULD
MAKE HIM SAY SOMETHING LIKE
THAT.

01:31:01.890 --> 01:31:04.570
WHERE DO YOU THINK I GOT THE
IDEA TO SCULPT A NAKED WOMAN,
MOTHER?

01:31:05.593 --> 01:31:06.493
WASN'T FROM RODIN.

01:31:06.494 --> 01:31:08.429
CALVIN, LET'S JUST CALM DOWN,

01:31:08.430 --> 01:31:11.150
OKAY, AND THINK ABOUT WHAT IS
COMING OUT OF OUR MOUTHS
BEFORE WE TALK.

01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:13.901
IT WAS HER PARADING AROUND

01:31:13.902 --> 01:31:15.836
WITH HER TITS OUT, BEGGING ME TO

01:31:15.837 --> 01:31:17.271
LOOK AND HER KISSING ME AND

01:31:17.272 --> 01:31:18.839
GIVING ME A FUCKING LAP DANCE

01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:21.342
AND THEN PRETENDING
LIKE IT MEANT NOTHING.

01:31:21.343 --> 01:31:24.244
WHY DO YOU THINK
THAT I CALLED IT "KELLY"?

01:31:24.245 --> 01:31:25.612
TELL HER.
THAT'S...

01:31:25.613 --> 01:31:26.780
COME ON.
THAT'S ENOUGH.

01:31:26.781 --> 01:31:27.514
TELL HER.

01:31:27.515 --> 01:31:29.750
TELL ME WHAT?

01:31:29.751 --> 01:31:31.318
IT WASN'T LIKE THAT.

01:31:31.319 --> 01:31:33.020
IT WASN'T

01:31:33.021 --> 01:31:33.754
LIKE THAT.

01:31:33.755 --> 01:31:35.889
WASN'T LIKE THAT.

01:31:35.890 --> 01:31:38.459
WASN'T LIKE THAT.

01:31:42.931 --> 01:31:44.665
YOU SHOULD GO.

01:31:44.666 --> 01:31:46.533
JOSH, WAIT!

01:31:49.938 --> 01:31:51.538
WAIT!

01:31:51.539 --> 01:31:52.873
IT'S NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE!

01:31:52.874 --> 01:31:53.874
REALLY? REALLY?

01:31:53.875 --> 01:31:55.042
THEN WHAT IS IT, KEL?

01:31:55.043 --> 01:31:57.644
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THIS SHOULD
NOT BE CONFUSING.

01:31:57.645 --> 01:31:58.479
IT'S STUPID.

01:31:58.480 --> 01:32:00.547
IT'S A PUPPY-LOVE CRUSH.

01:32:00.548 --> 01:32:03.884
HE MADE A LIFE-SIZE NUDE
SCULPTURE OF YOU... A PRETTY

01:32:03.885 --> 01:32:06.687
ACCURATE ONE, TOO... AND
PUBLICLY DISPLAYED IT.

01:32:06.688 --> 01:32:07.688
I MEAN, CHRIST.

01:32:07.689 --> 01:32:08.555
IT'S NOTHING!

01:32:08.556 --> 01:32:09.857
IT'S NOTHING, I SWEAR!

01:32:09.858 --> 01:32:11.392
I JUST NEEDED SOMEONE
TO TALK TO.

01:32:11.393 --> 01:32:12.192
RIGHT, RIGHT.

01:32:12.193 --> 01:32:13.560
SO NATURALLY YOU THOUGHT A-A

01:32:13.561 --> 01:32:14.928
TEENAGE BOY WOULD BE THE PERFECT

01:32:14.929 --> 01:32:16.330
PERSON TO POUR YOUR HEART OUT

01:32:16.331 --> 01:32:17.131
TO, RIGHT?

01:32:17.132 --> 01:32:18.198
BECAUSE, WELL, I MEAN, HELL,

01:32:18.199 --> 01:32:19.533
THEY'RE LEGENDARY FOR BEING

01:32:19.534 --> 01:32:20.534
SENSITIVE AND INSIGHTFUL.

01:32:20.535 --> 01:32:21.902
I MEAN, ARE YOU SERIOUS?

01:32:21.903 --> 01:32:23.137
MAYBE IT DIDN'T OCCUR TO ME

01:32:23.138 --> 01:32:24.671
THAT ANYBODY COULD EVER LOOK AT

01:32:24.672 --> 01:32:26.707
ME LIKE THAT ANYMORE!

01:32:26.708 --> 01:32:29.143
KELLY, HE'S A CHILD.

01:32:29.144 --> 01:32:30.210
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?

01:32:30.211 --> 01:32:31.578
I DON'T KNOW, AND I WAS JUST

01:32:31.579 --> 01:32:33.080
LONELY, AND YOU WERE...

01:32:33.081 --> 01:32:35.816
OH, MY GOD.

01:32:35.817 --> 01:32:36.784
AND YOU WERE GONE
ALL THE TIME! >> YEAH, I WAS GONE!

01:32:36.785 --> 01:32:37.584
I WAS AT WORK!

01:32:37.585 --> 01:32:38.819
I WAS AT WORK!

01:32:38.820 --> 01:32:40.387
PROBABLY WITH YOUR SECRETARY!

01:32:40.388 --> 01:32:41.221
OH, MY GOD.

01:32:41.222 --> 01:32:42.589
ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS?

01:32:42.590 --> 01:32:44.925
ARE YOU REALLY GONNA TRY AND
TURN THIS AROUND ON ME?

01:32:44.926 --> 01:32:45.893
REALLY?

01:32:45.894 --> 01:32:47.528
I WAS WORKING MY ASS OFF, KELLY,

01:32:47.529 --> 01:32:49.530
FOR YOU, FOR JACKSON.

01:32:49.531 --> 01:32:50.497
FOR US.

01:32:50.498 --> 01:32:51.899
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

01:32:51.900 --> 01:32:52.566
MY PARENTS.

01:32:52.567 --> 01:32:53.901
WHAT ABOUT JACKSON?

01:32:53.902 --> 01:32:55.903
NOW YOU ASK.

01:32:55.904 --> 01:32:58.172
JOSH, WILL YOU JUST
TALK TO ME?

01:33:27.869 --> 01:33:30.471
THE BABY'S WITH JOSH.

01:33:30.472 --> 01:33:33.373
HE'S FINE.

01:33:33.374 --> 01:33:35.174
I JUST, UH, STOPPED BY TO GATHER
A FEW THINGS.

01:33:39.047 --> 01:33:40.807
JOSH WANTS TO CRASH ON OUR COUCH
FOR A WHILE.

01:33:43.585 --> 01:33:46.019
IF WE'RE OKAY WITH IT.

01:33:46.020 --> 01:33:48.088
AND WE ARE.

01:33:58.066 --> 01:34:01.001
A BABY CHANGES MARRIAGE IN
WAYS NO ONE CAN IMAGINE.

01:34:04.906 --> 01:34:08.742
IF THERE'S A CRACK BEFORE, IT
TENDS TO WIDEN.

01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:14.915
HE LOVES YOU.

01:34:14.916 --> 01:34:19.353
BUT YOU CAN ONLY PUSH SOMEONE
AWAY SO OFTEN.

01:34:22.690 --> 01:34:25.526
GIVE IT TIME.

01:34:25.527 --> 01:34:27.594
OKAY?

01:35:08.970 --> 01:35:09.770
JOSH.

01:35:09.771 --> 01:35:10.571
Kelly?

01:35:10.572 --> 01:35:12.306
This is Cal's mother.

01:35:12.307 --> 01:35:13.340
OH. HI.

01:35:13.341 --> 01:35:14.074
HELLO.

01:35:14.075 --> 01:35:15.642
Is Cal there?

01:35:15.643 --> 01:35:19.179
NO, I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM SINCE
THE GALLERY.

01:35:19.180 --> 01:35:20.981
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

01:35:21.983 --> 01:35:24.051
HELLO?

01:36:33.187 --> 01:36:36.456
CAL!

01:36:36.457 --> 01:36:38.592
CAL!

01:36:38.593 --> 01:36:41.361
YOU GOT EVERYBODY
WORRIED ABOUT YOU!

01:36:41.362 --> 01:36:44.398
<i>I'M</i> WORRIED ABOUT YOU!

01:36:44.399 --> 01:36:45.399
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:36:48.336 --> 01:36:49.803
I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU.

01:36:49.804 --> 01:36:52.172
YOU BROKE INTO A PUBLIC
BUILDING.

01:36:52.173 --> 01:36:54.775
DON'T YOU THINK YOU'RE
GONNA GET CAUGHT?

01:36:54.776 --> 01:36:55.876
I HAVE A MASK.

01:36:55.877 --> 01:36:57.177
THEY CAN'T I.D. ME.

01:36:57.178 --> 01:36:57.944
AND GLOVES.

01:36:57.945 --> 01:36:58.812
NO FINGERPRINTS.

01:36:58.813 --> 01:37:00.814
HOW MANY WHEELCHAIR BANDITS

01:37:00.815 --> 01:37:03.884
DO YOU THINK ARE OUT THERE, HUH?

01:37:03.885 --> 01:37:06.153
COME ON. WHAT'S YOUR PLAN?

01:37:10.958 --> 01:37:13.994
CAL, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

01:37:13.995 --> 01:37:14.861
COME ON.

01:37:14.862 --> 01:37:15.862
CAL!

01:37:18.866 --> 01:37:21.635
CAL.

01:37:21.636 --> 01:37:23.837
COME ON.

01:37:23.838 --> 01:37:26.907
COME ON. TALK TO ME.

01:37:33.881 --> 01:37:36.717
HOW MANY TIMES DO YOU THINK THAT

01:37:36.718 --> 01:37:38.185
ONE PERSON CAN HAVE THEIR HEART

01:37:38.186 --> 01:37:40.987
BROKEN IN A YEAR AND SURVIVE?

01:37:40.988 --> 01:37:43.023
EVERY TIME THAT YOU PUT SOMEONE

01:37:43.024 --> 01:37:44.891
UP ON A PEDESTAL, THEY JUST SHOW

01:37:44.892 --> 01:37:47.728
YOU HOW THEY DON'T DESERVE
TO BE THERE.

01:37:47.729 --> 01:37:49.229
I MEAN, I TRIED TO
LIFT BAILEY UP.

01:37:49.230 --> 01:37:50.597
I TRIED TO CLIMB TOO HIGH, AND

01:37:50.598 --> 01:37:52.265
I...

01:37:52.266 --> 01:37:53.800
FELL.

01:37:53.801 --> 01:37:56.603
AND THEN I DID IT WITH YOU.

01:37:56.604 --> 01:37:58.205
MY BLUE LADY.

01:37:58.206 --> 01:37:59.039
CAL...

01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:00.407
I REALIZE NOW THAT I SHOULD

01:38:00.408 --> 01:38:01.908
HAVE... I SHOULD HAVE NEVER

01:38:01.909 --> 01:38:03.043
TALKED TO YOU.

01:38:03.044 --> 01:38:04.878
I MEAN, I HAD UNREALISTIC
EXPECTATIONS.

01:38:04.879 --> 01:38:06.413
I SHOULD HAVE NEVER BROKEN DOWN

01:38:06.414 --> 01:38:09.716
MY WALL OF ILLUSION.

01:38:12.854 --> 01:38:15.922
YOU PAINT A PICTURE OF SOMEONE

01:38:15.923 --> 01:38:19.359
THAT YOU WANT TO SEE.

01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:20.694
AND THE REALITY NEVER
MEASURES UP.

01:38:25.233 --> 01:38:26.673
I TOOK MY BLUE LADY OFF HER
PEDESTAL.

01:38:28.970 --> 01:38:31.238
OKAY, I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE

01:38:31.239 --> 01:38:33.173
SAYING, ALL RIGHT, AND I

01:38:33.174 --> 01:38:36.576
COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND YOU.

01:38:36.577 --> 01:38:39.179
BUT, YOU KNOW, WHY DON'T WE GO

01:38:39.180 --> 01:38:41.181
GET SOME COFFEE AND WE'LL

01:38:41.182 --> 01:38:43.550
CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION?

01:38:43.551 --> 01:38:44.951
WE CAN GO TO THE DINER OR
SOMETHING.

01:38:59.367 --> 01:39:01.935
SHIT.

01:39:05.006 --> 01:39:07.674
SEE? NOW WE'RE BOTH BROKEN.

01:39:12.013 --> 01:39:14.080
COME ON.

01:39:20.988 --> 01:39:23.223
GRADUATION'S NEXT WEEK.

01:39:23.224 --> 01:39:24.991
YEAH?

01:39:24.992 --> 01:39:26.626
YOU GONNA GO?

01:39:26.627 --> 01:39:28.328
I DON'T KNOW.

01:39:28.329 --> 01:39:29.930
APPARENTLY THEY'RE TRYING TO

01:39:29.931 --> 01:39:32.531
GIVE ME SOME KIND OF, LIKE, A
SCHOLARSHIP FOR WINNING THE ART
SHOW.

01:39:35.102 --> 01:39:36.636
WHO? SPECIAL TEENS?

01:39:36.637 --> 01:39:38.238
SPECIAL TEENS, YEAH.

01:39:38.239 --> 01:39:39.005
NO SHIT.

01:39:39.006 --> 01:39:41.041
DOES IT STILL COUNT IF YOU

01:39:41.042 --> 01:39:42.943
OBLITERATED THE WINNING ENTRY?

01:39:42.944 --> 01:39:45.979
MM-HMM. I TOOK PICTURES.

01:39:45.980 --> 01:39:48.315
WHY DO YOU DO THAT, CAL?

01:39:48.316 --> 01:39:49.596
DESTROY EVERYTHING THAT YOU
MAKE?

01:39:51.853 --> 01:39:53.253
I DON'T KNOW.

01:39:53.254 --> 01:39:56.990
I WAS THINKING THAT MAYBE I'M A
BUDDHIST AND I'M HIGHLIGHTING

01:39:56.991 --> 01:39:59.993
THE IMPERMANENCE OF THINGS, YOU
KNOW.

01:39:59.994 --> 01:40:01.628
YEAH, I'M SURE THAT'S IT.

01:40:01.629 --> 01:40:03.997
COULD BE LIKE... LIKE A
HINDU, YOU KNOW.

01:40:03.998 --> 01:40:06.032
REMINDING EVERYONE THE OTHER

01:40:06.033 --> 01:40:07.993
HALF OF CREATION IS DESTRUCTION.
BRAHMA AND SHIVA.

01:40:10.371 --> 01:40:11.271
YEP.

01:40:11.272 --> 01:40:13.673
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I THOUGHT.

01:40:13.674 --> 01:40:16.409
OR MAYBE I NEED TO CHILL THE
FUCK OUT.

01:40:16.410 --> 01:40:17.944
I DON'T KNOW.

01:40:17.945 --> 01:40:20.305
MAYBE THEY CAN TEACH ME THAT AT
ART SCHOOL, LIKE, PREFERABLY

01:40:22.283 --> 01:40:23.763
WITH THE USE OF RECREATIONAL
DRUGGAGE.

01:40:27.188 --> 01:40:29.823
HUGS, NOT DRUGS.

01:40:29.824 --> 01:40:31.024
RIGHT.

01:40:31.025 --> 01:40:32.745
'CAUSE LIFE IS PRECIOUS, SHORT
AND PRECIOUS.

01:40:35.796 --> 01:40:37.864
YEAH.

01:40:42.637 --> 01:40:43.917
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN WITH, UH,

01:40:46.040 --> 01:40:48.608
WITH JOSH?

01:40:48.609 --> 01:40:50.677
I DON'T KNOW.

01:40:54.448 --> 01:40:55.982
AM I EVER GONNA SEE YOU

01:40:55.983 --> 01:40:57.083
AGAIN?

01:41:00.488 --> 01:41:02.556
I-I DON'T KNOW.

01:41:07.662 --> 01:41:11.097
I LOVE YOU.

01:41:11.098 --> 01:41:13.366
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

01:41:16.637 --> 01:41:18.705
I KNOW.

01:41:26.414 --> 01:41:28.481
YOU'LL GET OVER IT.

01:41:32.720 --> 01:41:34.788
I PROMISE.

01:42:27.575 --> 01:42:29.142
HELLO, KELLY.

01:42:29.143 --> 01:42:32.012
HI, BEV.

01:42:32.013 --> 01:42:33.980
IS JOSH HERE?

01:42:33.981 --> 01:42:36.049
COME ON IN.

01:42:39.887 --> 01:42:41.955
THANK YOU.

01:42:45.292 --> 01:42:47.160
WAKE UP, JOSH.

01:42:53.434 --> 01:42:56.169
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

01:42:56.170 --> 01:42:59.172
I CAME TO APOLOGIZE.

01:42:59.173 --> 01:43:01.441
OUTSIDE.

01:43:21.228 --> 01:43:23.630
IS HE SLEEPING?

01:43:23.631 --> 01:43:25.532
YEAH.

01:43:25.533 --> 01:43:26.533
GOOD.

01:43:32.940 --> 01:43:35.075
SO...

01:43:35.076 --> 01:43:37.544
UM...

01:43:37.545 --> 01:43:39.245
I'VE BEEN THINKING

01:43:39.246 --> 01:43:40.914
A LOT ABOUT YOU
AND ME.

01:43:45.086 --> 01:43:47.053
I'M REALLY
SORRY FOR THE WAY I TREATED YOU.

01:43:57.264 --> 01:44:00.333
AND I'M SORRY FOR THE WAY
I'VE BEEN ACTING.

01:44:11.278 --> 01:44:14.347
I UNDERSTAND IF YOU DON'T
WANT TO TALK.

01:44:19.620 --> 01:44:23.123
IT'S JUST LATELY I FELT LIKE I
TOTALLY LOST WHO I WAS BEFORE
JACKSON.

01:44:26.727 --> 01:44:29.629
AND THEN I'D LOST YOU, AND...

01:44:29.630 --> 01:44:30.630
AND I REALLY NEEDED YOU.

01:44:33.300 --> 01:44:34.300
I CAN'T DO IT BY MYSELF.

01:44:37.404 --> 01:44:39.405
AND I DON'T WANT TO.

01:44:39.406 --> 01:44:40.740
ME NEITHER.

01:44:48.616 --> 01:44:49.649
I SCREWED UP SO BAD.

01:44:49.650 --> 01:44:50.316
STOP. STOP.

01:44:50.317 --> 01:44:51.384
LET ME JUST SAY SOMETHING.

01:44:54.688 --> 01:44:55.688
I LOVE YOU.

01:44:58.292 --> 01:45:00.360
I'VE ALWAYS LOVED YOU.

01:45:08.669 --> 01:45:10.937
I KNEW YOU NEEDED ME.

01:45:10.938 --> 01:45:13.306
BUT I JUST... I DIDN'T KNOW HOW.

01:45:21.882 --> 01:45:23.082
I GUESS WE NEED TO TRY HARDER.

01:45:25.486 --> 01:45:27.353
BOTH OF US.

01:45:31.592 --> 01:45:33.660
I'D LIKE THAT.

01:46:03.791 --> 01:46:06.492
 AND ALL YOU LEARN IS YOU

01:46:06.493 --> 01:46:07.760
REGRET 

01:46:07.761 --> 01:46:10.029
 OH, YOU'RE WALKING DOWN

01:46:10.030 --> 01:46:11.364
AGAIN 

01:46:22.643 --> 01:46:25.211
 I WANT TO TELL YOU HOW I

01:46:25.212 --> 01:46:26.379
FEEL 

01:46:29.416 --> 01:46:30.696
 I NEEDED SOMETHING TO
BELIEVE
