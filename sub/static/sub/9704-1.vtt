<i>You want to know how
to become a champion?</i>

00:22.322 --> 00:23.922
<i>It's easy.</i>

00:23.923 --> 00:26.358
<i>Turn your dream into your goal.</i>

00:26.359 --> 00:28.861
<i>Plant it deep in your heart,</i>

00:28.862 --> 00:31.363
<i>then for the next 10 years,</i>

00:31.364 --> 00:36.702
<i>eat, sleep, breathe,
laugh, and cry</i>

00:36.703 --> 00:40.610
<i>without ever taking
your eye off your goal.</i>

00:41.574 --> 00:43.820
<i>Not even for a second.</i>

00:44.744 --> 00:47.913
<i>You want to know how to
stop becoming a champion?</i>

00:47.914 --> 00:49.955
<i>I actually tried that once.</i>

00:50.316 --> 00:52.718
<i>Believe it or not,</i>

00:52.719 --> 00:55.090
<i>that was a lot harder.</i>

01:01.995 --> 01:03.095
She's still bleeding.

01:04.563 --> 01:07.266
- Pulse ox 178.
- Let me see her!

01:07.267 --> 01:10.309
- Doctor. Blood pressure.
- Let me see her.

01:10.770 --> 01:12.838
- Take the baby out of here.
- Right away, Doctor.

01:12.839 --> 01:13.906
No, why can't I see the baby?

01:13.907 --> 01:16.942
<i>My mom nearly died
the day I was born.</i>

01:16.943 --> 01:18.343
<i>The way I heard it later,</i>

01:18.344 --> 01:22.815
<i>it was a collision course of everything
going wrong at the same time.</i>

01:22.816 --> 01:25.250
Tim, go with her! Don't
leave the baby alone!

01:25.251 --> 01:27.653
<i>But even then, she wasn't
thinking about herself.</i>

01:27.654 --> 01:28.987
- You're gonna be fine.
- What's wrong with her?

01:28.988 --> 01:31.056
Why can't I see my baby?

01:31.057 --> 01:34.126
Why can't I see the baby?
Why can't I see her?

01:34.127 --> 01:36.634
It's called branched-chain
ketoaciduria.

01:36.830 --> 01:38.931
It's a rare blood deficiency.

01:38.932 --> 01:40.933
Tell me what that means.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.201
It's a metabolic disorder.

01:42.202 --> 01:47.439
A deficiency of the branched-chain
alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex,

01:47.440 --> 01:49.274
which catalyzes the catabolism

01:49.275 --> 01:51.643
of the branched-chain
amino acids...

01:51.644 --> 01:53.679
<i>These are all just fancy words for,</i>

01:53.680 --> 01:54.913
<i>"We don't know how to fix"</i>

01:54.914 --> 01:56.248
<i>"what's wrong with your baby."</i>

02:11.397 --> 02:13.267
All right, should be just up ahead.

02:14.167 --> 02:17.346
<i>Mom thought a new city would
help my dad find a job.</i>

02:17.770 --> 02:21.607
<i>But by the time we got to Tulsa,
the landlord had given our place away.</i>

02:21.608 --> 02:24.710
<i>He kept our down payment, too.</i>

02:24.711 --> 02:29.790
<i>And we had so many eviction judgments
against us, no one else would rent to us.</i>

02:31.217 --> 02:33.785
- How soon?
- By tomorrow.

02:33.786 --> 02:36.396
Check out by noon at the latest.

02:37.323 --> 02:39.034
We got him to give
us an extra hour.

02:40.360 --> 02:42.503
Did you tell him we have four kids?

02:42.896 --> 02:44.903
Yeah, he knows.

02:46.599 --> 02:47.733
Look, why don't you
call your mother...

02:47.734 --> 02:49.902
I'm not gonna call her again.

02:49.903 --> 02:53.705
We've done this enough to her
and to the rest of my family.

02:53.706 --> 02:55.806
They don't need to know
it's gotten this bad again.

02:56.943 --> 02:58.313
All right, baby.

03:05.518 --> 03:07.354
Hey, honey.

03:09.455 --> 03:10.956
Stop jumping on the bed, sweetie.

03:10.957 --> 03:12.930
Stop jumping on the bed. Sit down.

03:25.471 --> 03:26.838
Gabrielle's getting
better, isn't she?

03:26.839 --> 03:29.380
Yes, she is getting better.

03:31.878 --> 03:34.180
- Mom?
- Yes?

03:34.614 --> 03:36.757
How come we had to leave again?

03:38.885 --> 03:41.186
Daddy's not working.

03:41.187 --> 03:43.967
But this is kind of like camping.

03:44.390 --> 03:46.533
If we're camping,
then where are the tents?

03:48.027 --> 03:50.529
Don't worry. Everything's
gonna be okay.

03:50.530 --> 03:52.138
Why don't you try
to get some sleep?

03:52.765 --> 03:54.442
It's too cold.

03:54.867 --> 03:56.578
Come on. Come here.

03:57.170 --> 03:58.770
Let's get you warmed up

03:58.771 --> 04:02.074
and get you thinking
about other things.

04:02.075 --> 04:03.942
Let me hear you say your prayer.

04:03.943 --> 04:05.344
Heavenly Father...

04:05.345 --> 04:08.213
We thank you for all of
your many blessings,

04:08.214 --> 04:12.551
and thank you for watching over us and
giving us sweet and peaceful sleep.

04:12.552 --> 04:14.297
- Amen.
- Amen.

04:15.188 --> 04:17.024
Very good.

04:17.991 --> 04:20.271
Oh, I love you, sweetie.

04:26.833 --> 04:28.700
You told me last week I was...

04:43.716 --> 04:45.791
What did he say?

04:46.619 --> 04:48.899
He said they can't lend
me any more money.

04:50.356 --> 04:52.158
It's not what he told me last week.

04:52.959 --> 04:56.261
You know, Nat, I should've
never have asked.

04:56.262 --> 04:57.796
I don't need to sink to that level.

04:57.797 --> 05:01.135
You know, I still got my pride.

05:01.601 --> 05:03.168
I just got to wait for
my ship to come in.

05:03.169 --> 05:05.210
That's all.

05:07.907 --> 05:09.618
I'm calling my mom.

05:10.977 --> 05:12.544
I thought we weren't gonna
crash at your mom's house.

05:12.545 --> 05:14.188
We're not.

05:14.480 --> 05:17.124
I am with the kids.

05:19.452 --> 05:20.753
What?

05:21.487 --> 05:23.323
I can't do this anymore.

05:23.489 --> 05:24.923
You don't mean that, Natalie.

05:24.924 --> 05:26.425
I'm gonna get on my feet.
You know that.

05:26.426 --> 05:28.860
We don't have money for gas.

05:28.861 --> 05:31.334
And when the kids wake up,
what are we gonna feed them?

05:31.631 --> 05:33.532
We'll find something.

05:33.533 --> 05:35.600
You know, we'll go on
assistance until I can get...

05:35.601 --> 05:39.504
No, no, no, no. Don't talk
to me about food stamps.

05:39.505 --> 05:42.217
That's one thing I will never do.

05:43.376 --> 05:46.945
I'm just tired of promises
that don't come true.

05:46.946 --> 05:48.947
Natalie, where's your faith?

05:48.948 --> 05:50.515
God is looking out for us.

05:50.516 --> 05:52.150
- Please.
- Scripture says that we...

05:52.151 --> 05:54.653
Please! Please.

05:54.654 --> 05:58.800
God is not gonna come down from
his throne and give you a job.

06:00.259 --> 06:02.903
I'm tired of waiting for
your ship to come in.

06:04.030 --> 06:07.140
I'm gonna get on my own two feet.

06:13.206 --> 06:16.608
Hey! Here my grandbabies. Hey!

06:16.609 --> 06:20.846
Hey, John! Oh! Look at my babies!

06:20.847 --> 06:25.417
- Hi!
- Hey, sweetie! Hey, Arielle.

06:25.418 --> 06:28.453
You guys go inside and
get some lemonade.

06:28.454 --> 06:30.734
Hey, there, little Gabrielle!

06:31.457 --> 06:33.892
John, come on and go in the house.

06:33.893 --> 06:36.395
You're not gonna be my
little bit for too long.

06:36.396 --> 06:39.664
Wow, look at her! She's
putting on some weight!

06:39.665 --> 06:41.867
Yeah, her blood count is
practically back to normal.

06:41.868 --> 06:43.034
Hey, Mama.

06:43.035 --> 06:45.270
- She's not gonna be my little bit no more.
- No.

06:45.271 --> 06:46.972
Hey, baby.

06:46.973 --> 06:49.514
Well, you know, he can come inside.

06:49.709 --> 06:51.386
Yeah, I think he's afraid.

06:51.944 --> 06:54.312
Well, I'm not gonna bite him.

06:54.313 --> 06:57.423
He's afraid of how he
looks in your eyes.

07:06.759 --> 07:10.836
You look tired, baby. You should
have called me earlier. Come on.

07:11.397 --> 07:13.699
Yeah. You hungry?

07:14.801 --> 07:19.237
Hey, little bit! Look at
my little thing! What?

07:19.238 --> 07:21.347
She's getting so heavy!

07:28.314 --> 07:32.118
Hey, looks like you
got lots of options.

07:32.218 --> 07:33.622
Mmm.

07:34.187 --> 07:36.489
What's that mean? Mmm?

07:36.889 --> 07:39.524
I'm gonna walk into these
places like, "Hire me!"

07:39.525 --> 07:40.892
And what are they gonna see first?

07:40.893 --> 07:42.968
My failures or my desperation?

07:43.162 --> 07:44.863
And if they ask for a
resume, then what?

07:44.864 --> 07:48.200
No husband, four kids, no address.

07:48.201 --> 07:50.902
Don't do that to yourself, Natalie.

07:50.903 --> 07:55.379
You just freed yourself up so you
could make your life different.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.175
That was the hard part.

07:57.176 --> 07:59.644
Now go make your life different.

07:59.645 --> 08:03.114
Hold your head up. Let
them see what I'm seeing.

08:03.115 --> 08:07.557
Courage. Nobody can
stop you anymore.

08:08.287 --> 08:09.827
Nobody.

08:11.791 --> 08:14.559
- I love you, Mom.
- I know you better.

08:16.729 --> 08:18.330
What you got?

08:18.331 --> 08:19.831
Oh...

08:19.832 --> 08:22.033
<i>Miss Carolyn was right.</i>

08:22.034 --> 08:25.804
<i>It took some time, but Mom got
a job as a bad-debt collector.</i>

08:25.805 --> 08:26.972
<i>Here's a tip.</i>

08:26.973 --> 08:30.208
<i>If you owe money, you do not
want my mom coming after you.</i>

08:30.209 --> 08:35.179
<i>In no time, she was a star employee, and
we finally rented a house of our own.</i>

08:35.181 --> 08:37.427
Try this. One-handed.

08:38.751 --> 08:41.030
I can do that. Watch!

08:45.024 --> 08:46.598
Whoo!

08:47.059 --> 08:50.462
- Gabrielle!
- Did you see me, Mom? One-handed!

08:50.463 --> 08:51.930
Girl, you're gonna break your neck.

08:51.931 --> 08:54.466
Did you see it, Mom? Did you?

08:54.467 --> 08:55.800
Did you see my shrub?

08:55.801 --> 08:58.103
One-handed! But I can
do it no-handed.

08:58.104 --> 08:59.604
- Want to see?
- It's called an aerial.

08:59.605 --> 09:01.773
- I can still do it.
- But I haven't taught you yet.

09:01.774 --> 09:04.409
- Doesn't matter! Watch!
- Hey, hey, hey! Get in this house!

09:04.410 --> 09:07.646
I know every single one of you
have homework to do, so let's go.

09:07.647 --> 09:09.517
I can do an aerial.

09:11.083 --> 09:12.851
Look at my shrub!

09:12.852 --> 09:16.497
Why would you think the shrub
would be a landing pad?

09:17.423 --> 09:21.227
Here we go. There.

09:21.360 --> 09:24.930
"Today should always be
better than yesterday."

09:24.931 --> 09:26.231
Why that one?

09:26.232 --> 09:29.234
Because that, John,
is the secret to life.

09:29.235 --> 09:30.869
- A secret?
- Mmm-hmm.

09:30.870 --> 09:33.446
That's the reason why it's at
the top of our vision board.

09:33.506 --> 09:37.709
It's like another way of saying,
"Don't look back. Move forward."

09:37.710 --> 09:39.778
God helps those who
help themselves.

09:39.779 --> 09:41.146
How do you think we got here?

09:41.147 --> 09:44.249
- We rented a truck.
- All right, smarty-pants.

09:44.250 --> 09:47.292
- God helped us rent the truck.
- There you go.

09:48.154 --> 09:51.823
- Put this on the vision board.
- We are not getting a dog.

09:51.824 --> 09:54.764
But, Mom! It will make today
better than yesterday.

09:55.361 --> 09:58.363
All right, I'll put it up,
but only as a metaphor.

09:58.364 --> 09:59.731
A what?

09:59.732 --> 10:02.667
Um... A reminder to
follow your dreams,

10:02.668 --> 10:05.937
even though we are
not getting a dog.

10:05.938 --> 10:08.106
- So where do you want to put him?
- Right here.

10:08.107 --> 10:10.648
- All right. You put it up there.
- Okay.

10:17.216 --> 10:20.085
- You broke it!
- Did not! Tag! You're it!

10:20.086 --> 10:23.588
- That's unfair!
- You're just a slowpoke! Slowpoke!

10:23.589 --> 10:27.496
Hey, hey, hey, hey! I'm on
the phone. Take that outside.

10:28.928 --> 10:30.028
Yes.

10:30.029 --> 10:31.830
Hey! Hey! Come back here!

10:31.831 --> 10:36.668
Yeah. Yeah, I can do Wednesday,
too, if I really push it. For sure.

10:36.669 --> 10:38.573
Okay. Thank you.

10:42.274 --> 10:44.076
You're it!

10:52.151 --> 10:53.589
Hmm.

10:54.387 --> 10:57.989
Nice work, Arie.
You're moving fast.

10:59.558 --> 11:01.735
Ooh!

11:02.294 --> 11:07.298
What did she break now? I swear,
that child is gonna drive me crazy.

11:07.299 --> 11:09.044
You should put her
in gymnastics class.

11:09.335 --> 11:13.838
Who? Brie? No, I always
saw you as the gym star.

11:13.839 --> 11:18.977
The leotards on and your hair in a
cute bun. We just couldn't afford it.

11:18.978 --> 11:23.481
Mom, I've taught Brie everything
I know. She just eats it up.

11:23.482 --> 11:25.950
Remember when I tried back
handsprings when I was nine?

11:25.951 --> 11:28.687
Yeah, and I remember you
broke both of your wrists.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.722
Brie's already doing them.

11:30.723 --> 11:32.502
Mom! Look!

11:34.226 --> 11:35.794
- Whoa!
- Ooh!

11:39.932 --> 11:41.472
Sorry, Mom!

11:42.234 --> 11:45.003
You should put her in gymnastics
class so she can learn the right way

11:45.004 --> 11:47.306
before she hurts herself.

11:47.473 --> 11:50.049
Okay, now hit the handstand.

11:56.749 --> 12:00.151
You finally get here, and
now you want to be shy?

12:00.152 --> 12:03.755
<i>It wasn't that.
I couldn't believe my eyes.</i>

12:03.756 --> 12:06.958
<i>Imagine all your Christmases
rolled into one moment.</i>

12:06.959 --> 12:09.160
<i>That's what it was like.</i>

12:09.161 --> 12:14.342
<i>And I knew right then I was exactly
where I was supposed to be.</i>

12:16.602 --> 12:18.108
Gabrielle!

12:19.371 --> 12:21.810
Brie! Brie, get back here!

12:22.408 --> 12:24.776
- She yours?
- Uh... Yeah. I'm sorry.

12:24.777 --> 12:27.785
We're here to sign up for
the Saturday rec class.

12:27.847 --> 12:29.714
Yeah, I don't think so.

12:29.715 --> 12:32.461
She's just a little excited.
That's all.

12:33.352 --> 12:36.121
Oh. No, no, no. What I
mean is... I'm sorry. Mrs...

12:36.122 --> 12:38.623
- Hawkins. Natalie.
- Natalie, hi. Dirk.

12:38.624 --> 12:41.092
No, rec class is just tumbling.
It's for beginners.

12:41.093 --> 12:42.694
How much training has she had?

12:42.695 --> 12:46.865
None, unless you want to count climbing on
all the furniture and breaking half of it.

12:46.866 --> 12:49.339
- None?
- Wow.

12:51.871 --> 12:54.242
TOPs for six months, then Dev.

12:54.406 --> 12:56.741
That's what I was thinking.
Elite in five years.

12:56.742 --> 12:58.385
Mom, look!

13:02.248 --> 13:03.615
What's her name?

13:03.616 --> 13:05.361
Uh, Gabrielle Douglas.

13:05.484 --> 13:07.092
Gabby Douglas.

13:13.459 --> 13:14.526
Here's your lunch.

13:14.527 --> 13:16.995
I want you to eat it all this
time, not just the snacks.

13:16.996 --> 13:19.664
Coach said if I do good in TOPs,
I'll get invited to training camp.

13:19.665 --> 13:22.967
- Well. "If I do well."
- Mom, training camp is with the Karolyis.

13:22.968 --> 13:25.770
Mary Lou Retton's
coach, Bela Karolyi!

13:25.771 --> 13:29.007
Okay, okay. But, listen, Breezy,
I want you to eat all your lunch.

13:29.008 --> 13:30.341
How are you gonna get strong

13:30.342 --> 13:32.883
if you don't eat all your lunch?
Here you go.

13:33.078 --> 13:35.647
- Are you coming?
- Have I ever missed a competition?

13:35.648 --> 13:38.516
- Is John gonna be there?
- John has basketball practice,

13:38.517 --> 13:41.586
Arie has cheer practice, and Joy has
an ice-skating lesson in half an hour.

13:41.587 --> 13:43.421
I got to get them there. See you!

13:43.422 --> 13:46.202
- Love you, Mom! Bye!
- I love you, too, Breezy!

13:54.800 --> 13:56.841
Never seen a lady in a robe before?

14:00.072 --> 14:01.639
Yeah, I don't think
this prescription

14:01.640 --> 14:03.741
is working any better
than the last one.

14:03.742 --> 14:06.878
Yeah, the migraines
are getting worse.

14:06.879 --> 14:09.647
Yeah. Nauseous, light-sensitive.

14:09.648 --> 14:12.451
I feel like one is coming on now.

14:13.385 --> 14:16.487
Oh. More sleep? With four kids?

14:16.488 --> 14:18.529
That's not gonna happen.

14:21.760 --> 14:23.368
<i>You got to concentrate.</i>

14:23.462 --> 14:26.030
This is one of the most
important skills in gymnastics.

14:26.031 --> 14:31.405
Why? Because the kip involves
coordination, timing, and strength.

14:31.503 --> 14:33.838
Now, some of you are having problems
with it, but you'll get there.

14:33.839 --> 14:35.139
Unless you're too short.

14:35.140 --> 14:37.475
As long as you focus
on the fundamentals

14:37.476 --> 14:39.244
and do your drills.
I want to see that...

14:39.245 --> 14:42.247
<i>Mom told me life wasn't always
gonna be a day at the beach.</i>

14:42.248 --> 14:45.383
<i>She said I should let her know
if anyone said mean things.</i>

14:45.384 --> 14:49.131
But it all starts
with concentration.

14:49.521 --> 14:51.892
Lucy, show us how it's done.

14:57.663 --> 14:59.499
Okay. All right.

15:00.532 --> 15:02.834
You need to work on that
upper body. Strong finish.

15:02.835 --> 15:04.535
Gabby, you're up.

15:04.536 --> 15:08.113
<i>But I didn't tell my mom.
I had my own way.</i>

15:13.545 --> 15:16.826
Yes! Perfect. Now, that's the kip.

15:17.883 --> 15:21.519
So, again, if y'all don't have
what it takes to master the kip,

15:21.520 --> 15:23.655
you don't have what it
takes to be a gymnast.

15:23.656 --> 15:25.516
You don't have what it
takes to be a gymnast.

15:59.358 --> 16:01.526
So explain this to me again.

16:01.527 --> 16:06.799
You're charging the kids money
to watch Gabrielle do what?

16:07.199 --> 16:10.034
Tricks, flips and cartwheels.

16:10.035 --> 16:12.437
You can't take their lunch money!

16:12.438 --> 16:14.939
We're not taking it.
They're giving it to us.

16:14.940 --> 16:17.342
I got $2 for a back walkover.

16:17.343 --> 16:20.111
I don't care. Tomorrow,
you take this back,

16:20.112 --> 16:22.413
and you give them every penny back.

16:22.414 --> 16:23.514
- What?
- Mom!

16:23.515 --> 16:26.084
No, it's not open for discussion.

16:26.085 --> 16:27.420
I need to lie down.

16:40.766 --> 16:42.867
What's happening now?

16:42.868 --> 16:46.547
Her lights are still off.
I think she's crying.

16:46.772 --> 16:48.339
It's my fault for taking the money.

16:48.340 --> 16:49.874
- No, it's not.
- Is too!

16:49.875 --> 16:52.844
Mom said she couldn't afford
to send me to gym camp.

16:52.845 --> 16:55.480
John and I were gonna raise the
money ourselves, and now...

16:55.481 --> 16:59.717
Hey. It's not your fault.
Mom isn't feeling well.

16:59.718 --> 17:02.120
It doesn't have anything
to do with you.

17:02.121 --> 17:05.490
Besides, if you need money,

17:05.491 --> 17:07.771
Joy and I will give up our sports.

17:09.127 --> 17:10.228
John, are they tricking me?

17:10.229 --> 17:13.297
You got a talent, Brie.
We all see that.

17:13.298 --> 17:15.066
You've got to start seeing it, too.

17:15.067 --> 17:17.243
You could be the best.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.657
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:11.657 --> 18:14.631
- She's like me, Mom.
- Yes, she is.
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:14.631 --> 18:16.061
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:16.061 --> 18:19.397
Are you gonna be a
superstar like her, too?
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:19.398 --> 18:20.699
Yeah?
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:20.699 --> 18:21.867
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:21.867 --> 18:22.000
Yeah.
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:22.000 --> 18:23.334
Yeah.

18:23.335 --> 18:24.669
Well, don't you worry.

18:24.670 --> 18:29.140
I am gonna find the money
to get you to that camp.

18:29.141 --> 18:32.786
Let Mary Lou Retton's coaches
see the next superstar.

18:34.680 --> 18:36.114
Are you sick, Mom?

18:36.115 --> 18:37.416
Mmm.

18:37.983 --> 18:39.660
I'm as tough as nails.

18:39.918 --> 18:43.324
Don't you worry about me.
All right?

18:45.224 --> 18:46.958
Now, you go to sleep,

18:46.959 --> 18:50.138
'cause the world is waiting
for you in the morning.

18:53.265 --> 18:56.546
- Good night, sweetheart.
- Good night, Mom.

19:01.540 --> 19:05.276
<i>Time went by. Mom liked us
all to have focus and goals,</i>

19:05.277 --> 19:09.413
<i>so she liked that the stronger I got, the
harder I worked to get even stronger.</i>

19:09.414 --> 19:13.751
<i>As long as today was better than
yesterday, we were all doing okay.</i>

19:13.752 --> 19:16.521
Well, I mean, she's got the
drive, and she's getting noticed.

19:16.522 --> 19:18.656
The next step is to get her
qualified for Junior Elite.

19:18.657 --> 19:21.125
- Junior Elite?
- Yeah, she'd be in a higher level

19:21.126 --> 19:23.794
and training for harder
skills, more competitions.

19:23.795 --> 19:25.496
Britney's a Junior Elite.

19:25.497 --> 19:27.832
Britney's dad runs a bank.

19:27.833 --> 19:31.169
Well, I mean, if you're
serious about the sport...

19:31.170 --> 19:34.372
What I'm serious about is that my
kids have something to believe in.

19:34.373 --> 19:37.608
Well, perfect. Then we'll get
her qualified for Junior Elite.

19:37.609 --> 19:39.744
You'll be on the road a lot more.

19:39.745 --> 19:41.479
Probably have to homeschool her.

19:41.480 --> 19:43.981
- Homeschool?
- Yeah. Mmm-hmm.

19:43.982 --> 19:47.585
93, 94, 95, 96, 97...

19:47.586 --> 19:50.621
Coach! How am I supposed
to concentrate here?

19:50.622 --> 19:53.960
98, 99,100! 101,102...

20:23.021 --> 20:26.157
<i>A 14.350 for Gabby Davis, uh...</i>

20:26.158 --> 20:29.098
<i>Douglas, rather, the newcomer
out of Virginia Beach.</i>

20:52.451 --> 20:55.152
Yes! Way to go, Gabrielle!

20:55.153 --> 20:57.121
<i>Gabby Douglas continues to impress.</i>

20:57.122 --> 20:58.833
That's my girl.

21:10.569 --> 21:13.904
<i>And here comes Shawn Johnson, and
you can hear the audience reaction.</i>

21:13.905 --> 21:15.411
<i>They love her.</i>

21:21.446 --> 21:24.124
<i>Hardest vault in the competition.</i>

21:26.151 --> 21:28.055
<i>And dead-on!</i>

21:28.387 --> 21:31.964
<i>And she is one happy
camper right now.</i>

21:34.660 --> 21:36.871
That's gonna be you
out there one day.

21:46.171 --> 21:50.715
<i>Competitions take you to exciting
places and closer to your dreams.</i>

21:50.876 --> 21:52.843
<i>But they also expose your doubts.</i>

21:52.844 --> 21:55.181
206. Here we go.

21:58.850 --> 22:04.156
Wow! Breezy, you have
moved up in the world.

22:04.923 --> 22:06.827
I suck at bars.

22:07.993 --> 22:10.528
This is the nicest hotel
we've ever been in,

22:10.529 --> 22:15.599
and you're too busy giving yourself a
pity party that you don't even notice.

22:15.600 --> 22:19.177
Keep focusing on the negative,
and it'll come true.

22:21.640 --> 22:23.674
Oh! Come look at this view!

22:23.675 --> 22:26.644
Mom! I came in 16th today.

22:26.645 --> 22:28.446
I didn't make the National Team.

22:28.447 --> 22:30.381
What if I never make
the National Team?

22:30.382 --> 22:32.616
Not this year, or the
next year, or the next?

22:32.617 --> 22:36.865
Do you think before she won Shawn
Johnson never had a bad day?

22:37.122 --> 22:40.391
- Well, I promise you, she did.
- How do you know?

22:40.392 --> 22:43.260
Because, sweetie, anyone who's
ever reached for something,

22:43.261 --> 22:45.596
they've had a bad day.

22:45.597 --> 22:47.865
Gabrielle, you are 12 years old.

22:47.866 --> 22:50.701
Look around you. Look at
this place we're staying in.

22:50.702 --> 22:53.003
You're at a national competition.

22:53.004 --> 22:54.572
But you know what?

22:54.573 --> 22:56.073
If you're not having any fun,

22:56.074 --> 22:58.376
let's forget about this, go home,

22:58.377 --> 23:00.418
- sell your leos on eBay.
- No!

23:01.246 --> 23:05.050
Well, it doesn't look like
you're having any fun.

23:05.350 --> 23:09.320
There you go.
So, what do you think?

23:09.321 --> 23:12.923
A hotel like this probably
has a really nice bathtub.

23:12.924 --> 23:17.695
'Cause I wasn't gonna say anything before,
but, hoo, girl, you're kind of ripe.

23:18.764 --> 23:21.599
- I earned it.
- Yes, you did.

23:21.600 --> 23:23.436
Let's go run you a bath.

23:24.269 --> 23:25.775
Okay.

23:26.505 --> 23:28.216
Is my nose too flat?

23:28.907 --> 23:30.345
Did somebody tell you that?

23:32.244 --> 23:34.345
Because you have my mama's nose.

23:34.346 --> 23:36.447
Are you saying that Miss
Carolyn's nose is too flat?

23:36.448 --> 23:39.083
- No.
- Okay.

23:39.084 --> 23:42.353
'Cause she has a perfect
nose, just like you.

23:42.354 --> 23:44.054
Did I really get
Miss Carolyn's nose?

23:44.055 --> 23:47.958
Absolutely. And you got my smile.

23:49.261 --> 23:52.496
You're just like a little
jigsaw puzzle of all of us,

23:52.497 --> 23:54.936
and somehow you got
all the best parts.

23:55.400 --> 23:57.468
- Mom?
- Yes?

23:57.469 --> 24:00.438
- Can we get a dog now?
- No.

24:00.439 --> 24:01.806
Just a small one.

24:01.807 --> 24:03.240
Do you have wax in your ears?

24:03.241 --> 24:04.442
Let me see those ears.

24:04.443 --> 24:08.446
Oh, yeah, there's some wax
in here. I got to wash it out!

24:08.447 --> 24:12.583
Zoway! Zoway, Zoway! Come here!

24:12.584 --> 24:17.488
Don't get him excited!
You know he's already wild.

24:17.489 --> 24:20.124
Are you wild? Huh, boy? You wild?

24:20.125 --> 24:23.060
All right, now, you have to take him for
a walk, because I have to go to work.

24:23.061 --> 24:25.463
- You'll be back for tonight, right?
- I will try.

24:25.464 --> 24:27.298
Try? Mom, it's the Olympics.

24:27.299 --> 24:29.467
Olympic Trials, and I know.

24:29.468 --> 24:32.102
You've had it circled on the
calendar for over a year.

24:32.103 --> 24:33.504
I will be there.

24:33.505 --> 24:34.672
- Okay.
- All right.

24:34.673 --> 24:37.715
- Bye, Mom. Love you! Don't be late!
- Bye!

24:38.643 --> 24:41.082
- Love you, Brie!
- Bye!

24:51.122 --> 24:53.557
There she is, Shawn Johnson.

24:53.558 --> 24:56.427
<i>This is a multi-layered
story, Shawn Johnson.</i>

24:56.428 --> 24:59.697
<i>You saw her coach there,
Liang Chow, came from China.</i>

24:59.698 --> 25:02.945
<i>Opened up Chow's Gymnastics,
and one day, in walked Shawn.</i>

25:03.268 --> 25:06.048
<i>At that very moment,
he knew they had a future.</i>

25:27.192 --> 25:29.026
<i>I thought it was smoother
than the Nationals.</i>

25:29.027 --> 25:31.061
<i>Yeah, phenomenal.</i>

25:31.062 --> 25:33.998
<i>One of the most difficult
routines being done in the world.</i>

25:33.999 --> 25:37.801
<i>Has the highest degree of
difficulty for anyone in this meet.</i>

25:37.802 --> 25:41.171
<i>And on top of that, coming in
with brand-new choreography.</i>

25:41.172 --> 25:44.976
<i>It takes time to own your own routine
and to feel really comfortable.</i>

25:50.949 --> 25:54.662
Gabrielle? Are you okay?

25:56.154 --> 25:57.626
That's my coach.

26:00.458 --> 26:02.101
What are you talking about?

26:02.794 --> 26:07.372
I'm going to the Olympics, and
Liang Chow is gonna be my coach.

26:08.300 --> 26:10.443
The Olympics?

26:22.380 --> 26:24.748
<i>I wanted to stand on
the Olympic platform.</i>

26:24.749 --> 26:27.655
<i>I wanted to be the
best in the world.</i>

26:28.219 --> 26:31.090
<i>I could close my eyes and see it.</i>

26:32.390 --> 26:36.594
<i>Problem was, who believes a little
kid could have a dream so strong</i>

26:36.595 --> 26:39.563
<i>it would eat you alive
if it didn't come true?</i>

26:39.564 --> 26:41.935
<i>No one. That's who.</i>

26:50.742 --> 26:53.147
<i>But it was a dream
that wouldn't go away.</i>

26:55.380 --> 26:57.717
<i>It just got stronger.</i>

26:58.583 --> 27:02.695
<i>I knew it was time to make
everyone else believe in me, too.</i>

27:04.322 --> 27:07.524
All right, come on, everyone.
Let's clean up. Let's go.

27:07.525 --> 27:11.061
Coach! I can do the
Amanar vault. I'm ready.

27:11.062 --> 27:13.063
You're still not getting
enough height on your takeoff.

27:13.064 --> 27:15.065
One wrong landing,
you blow your ACLs,

27:15.066 --> 27:16.500
and that's it. Your career's over.

27:16.501 --> 27:18.669
Well, I can get more height.
Just show me.

27:18.670 --> 27:21.739
Stop rushing everything, Gabby.
I don't think you're ready yet.

27:21.740 --> 27:25.109
Well, if you don't believe in me,
how am I supposed to get anywhere?

27:25.110 --> 27:28.550
- Like the Olympics?
- Ashley, grab those mats.

27:29.881 --> 27:32.249
Gabby, be patient. There's time.

27:32.250 --> 27:33.917
Stop worrying about the Amanar.

27:33.918 --> 27:37.961
You have a competition coming up.
Focus on that. All right?

27:52.704 --> 27:53.804
You got it. You got it, Gabby.

27:53.805 --> 27:56.040
<i>One of the rising
stars of the sport.</i>

27:56.041 --> 27:59.243
<i>Every competition, she seems to
come out a little more polished.</i>

27:59.244 --> 28:03.347
<i>Absolutely. You know, you can
really sense the confidence here.</i>

28:03.348 --> 28:06.356
<i>I think this is gonna
be one to watch.</i>

28:07.852 --> 28:10.098
<i>Really good form here.</i>

28:11.656 --> 28:14.368
<i>And she really keeps those lines.</i>

28:20.465 --> 28:23.871
<i>This dismount's got a
high level of difficulty.</i>

28:26.337 --> 28:28.405
<i>Yes! What a strong finish.</i>

28:28.406 --> 28:30.441
<i>Really sticks the landing.
Look at her.</i>

28:30.442 --> 28:32.209
<i>Look at her. She knows it.
She is beaming.</i>

28:32.210 --> 28:34.512
Well, that was a surprise, huh?

28:34.946 --> 28:38.716
I didn't think you were gonna
pull that off. All right.

28:39.217 --> 28:43.120
What's that supposed to mean,
he didn't think I'd pull it off?

28:44.923 --> 28:46.657
I'll get it.

28:46.658 --> 28:49.159
He's my coach. Isn't he
supposed to believe in me?

28:49.160 --> 28:51.895
But he's always like, "No,
you're not ready for this."

28:51.896 --> 28:53.402
"You're not ready for that."

28:53.765 --> 28:55.899
- Well, I believe in you, Breezy.
- Hello?

28:55.900 --> 28:57.334
You're not my coach.

28:57.335 --> 28:59.103
I bet Coach Chow doesn't say that.

28:59.104 --> 29:00.170
Oh, boy.

29:00.171 --> 29:02.439
Now we're gonna be talking about Coach
Chow for the rest of the night, huh?

29:02.440 --> 29:03.640
Well, I bet he doesn't.

29:03.641 --> 29:06.443
- Mom, it's the pharmacy.
- All right. Coming.

29:06.444 --> 29:07.778
"Coach Chow. Coach Chow."

29:07.779 --> 29:09.980
Arie. Come on. Leave her alone.

29:09.981 --> 29:11.048
The pharmacy?

29:11.049 --> 29:15.126
It's nothing. I just have to
have my prescription changed.

29:33.138 --> 29:35.475
Is it hot in here to you?

29:41.079 --> 29:42.380
Um...

29:43.214 --> 29:44.615
Could you hold my place, please?

29:44.616 --> 29:46.650
I'm gonna go sit down for a second.

29:46.651 --> 29:48.191
Uh-huh. Sure.

29:49.721 --> 29:51.796
Right. Next, please.

30:00.665 --> 30:02.666
How do you have a bad
reaction to medicine?

30:02.667 --> 30:04.034
Isn't it supposed to help you?

30:04.035 --> 30:06.670
- I don't know, Gabrielle.
- Well, what does it mean?

30:06.671 --> 30:08.038
I'm not a doctor.

30:08.039 --> 30:10.274
It means she has to stop
working so she can rest.

30:10.275 --> 30:12.643
Mama tell you that?

30:12.644 --> 30:14.478
Stop working for how long?

30:16.080 --> 30:17.723
They're here.

30:25.590 --> 30:27.024
John. Arielle.

30:27.025 --> 30:30.499
Come help me get your
mother in the house.

30:31.196 --> 30:33.498
I got it, baby. I got it.

30:35.033 --> 30:36.368
Take your time.

30:37.302 --> 30:40.515
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm all right, sweetheart.

30:45.410 --> 30:46.916
Listen.

30:47.979 --> 30:51.315
Your mom had a bad reaction
to her medication,

30:51.316 --> 30:53.350
but she's gonna be okay.

30:53.351 --> 30:55.886
I don't want y'all to worry.

30:55.887 --> 30:58.555
But it could be a while before
she gets back on her feet.

30:58.556 --> 31:00.157
She's not allowed to work.

31:00.158 --> 31:04.428
So money is gonna get real
tight in the next few months

31:04.429 --> 31:06.970
until her disability kicks in.

31:09.200 --> 31:10.808
Okay?

31:14.439 --> 31:16.241
John?

31:25.316 --> 31:27.857
Brie, what are you doing here?

31:29.721 --> 31:32.422
Don't you have a practice to go to?

31:32.423 --> 31:34.498
It's too expensive, Mama.

31:34.692 --> 31:36.164
And we're poor.

31:40.899 --> 31:43.201
Do you know what poor is?

31:44.502 --> 31:47.715
Poor is when you run out of hope.

31:48.573 --> 31:51.376
And that's not us,
not by a long shot.

31:53.177 --> 31:55.115
You want to make me feel better?

31:57.882 --> 31:58.949
Then go to practice.

31:58.950 --> 32:01.018
You got a competition coming up,

32:01.019 --> 32:02.920
and you need to be ready for it.

32:02.921 --> 32:06.189
'Cause I'm gonna be at that
competition. I don't know about you.

32:06.190 --> 32:08.892
You plan on being at
that competition?

32:08.893 --> 32:11.264
Yeah? Well, go get ready.

Mom, what is it?

36:01.025 --> 36:03.168
They used to call them food stamps.

36:03.828 --> 36:06.574
- It looks like a debit card.
- Well, it's not.

36:11.402 --> 36:12.669
When you guys were younger,

36:12.670 --> 36:15.974
I vowed I would never, ever
rely on another handout.

36:28.553 --> 36:29.854
Nice!

36:30.254 --> 36:32.090
Come on, Kelly!

36:33.658 --> 36:36.593
Keep your legs straight this time.

36:36.594 --> 36:39.296
Please, Mom! What are the chances?

36:39.297 --> 36:44.410
I mean, it's a sign or something!
Coach Chow right here.

36:44.635 --> 36:47.737
It's fate or something, or
something meant to be, or...

36:47.738 --> 36:50.746
Are you gonna peel that, or are you
just gonna keep waving it around?

36:53.344 --> 36:58.093
Please, Mama. I mean,
I know it's more money,

36:59.383 --> 37:00.784
but what if it is fate?

37:00.785 --> 37:02.291
Mmm.

37:10.000 --> 37:10.661
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:10.661 --> 37:14.101

Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:14.101 --> 37:14.966
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:14.966 --> 37:16.566
You mean I get to go?

Oh, my God!
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:19.036 --> 37:20.670
I'm gonna tell him he's my hero,
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:20.671 --> 37:22.000
and I've waited my whole
entire life just to meet him,

37:24.141 --> 37:26.409
and I'm gonna show him
everything that I can do.

37:26.410 --> 37:30.380
You're gonna breathe. You're gonna
breathe when you talk to him.

37:31.449 --> 37:34.628
All right, now, peel
these carrots, girl.

37:45.830 --> 37:49.199
<i>And I'm gonna tell him I've waited
two whole years to meet him.</i>

37:49.200 --> 37:53.303
<i>I'm gonna tell him there isn't
anything I don't want to learn</i>

37:53.304 --> 37:55.845
<i>as long as he'll teach me.</i>

38:06.717 --> 38:08.997
Hello. I am Liang Chow.

38:14.392 --> 38:17.172
- Hi. I'm...
- I'm Gabrielle Douglas.

38:18.195 --> 38:21.669
Hello, Gabrielle Douglas. What
do you hope to learn today?

38:23.200 --> 38:24.501
Everything.

38:26.270 --> 38:28.638
I don't know about everything,

38:28.639 --> 38:30.179
but I'll try not to disappoint you.

38:31.509 --> 38:34.010
- Hi. I'm Liang Chow.
- I'm Ashley.

38:34.011 --> 38:35.381
Hi, Ashley.

38:35.846 --> 38:39.059
Let's talk about music, okay?

38:40.318 --> 38:42.218
You're probably thinking, "Music?"

38:42.219 --> 38:45.488
"I thought Chow was going
to teach me gymnastics!"

38:45.489 --> 38:50.093
Well, what if I told you all
gymnasts are musicians,

38:50.094 --> 38:52.704
and these are your instruments?

38:53.397 --> 38:57.567
Rhythm, and tempo,
the steady beats,

38:57.568 --> 38:59.936
and then the crescendo!

39:02.273 --> 39:06.142
Today I'm going to teach you
how to play these instruments.

39:06.143 --> 39:08.548
How many of you do doubles?

39:09.947 --> 39:13.626
How many of you are ready
to learn the Amanar?

39:18.489 --> 39:20.632
You, step out.

39:28.833 --> 39:31.968
- You can do a double twist?
- Sure.

39:33.471 --> 39:35.079
Show me.

39:35.106 --> 39:36.407
Okay.

39:51.088 --> 39:53.800
Yes! Lots of power! I like that!

39:57.461 --> 40:00.867
The Amanar was named for the
first gymnast who did it,

40:01.065 --> 40:02.399
Simona Amanar.

40:02.400 --> 40:04.768
It's one of the hardest
vaults in the sport.

40:04.769 --> 40:07.137
Not only is it two and
half twists in the air,

40:07.138 --> 40:10.106
which was considered impossible
before Simona did it,

40:10.107 --> 40:13.943
but it's a blind landing. You cannot
see the mat before you hit it.

40:16.747 --> 40:22.519
The vault's sound is fast,
strong, short notes, power.

40:22.520 --> 40:24.527
Think of a drum. Hmm?

40:25.256 --> 40:29.629
Now, give me the double twist but
stay in for the other half turn.

40:30.594 --> 40:31.895
Okay.

40:46.744 --> 40:49.345
Mama! Mama! He taught me!

40:49.346 --> 40:51.448
Mama, Coach Chow taught
me how to do the Amanar!

40:51.449 --> 40:53.249
I did it! I did the Amanar!

40:53.250 --> 40:56.486
Okay, okay! Calm down! You act
like the world's about to end.

40:56.487 --> 40:58.354
All right. Tell me
again but slowly.

40:58.355 --> 41:00.390
Mama, he taught me one of
the hardest vaults to do

41:00.391 --> 41:01.791
in just a few hours.

41:01.792 --> 41:04.971
Well, congratulations. it sounds like
you got something out of that clinic.

41:04.995 --> 41:06.996
No! That's not the point.

41:06.997 --> 41:09.299
If Liang Chow can teach
me that in two hours,

41:09.300 --> 41:11.801
just think what else
he could teach me.

41:11.802 --> 41:14.671
- I have to train with him.
- What.

41:14.672 --> 41:17.674
I want to move to Iowa and
train with Coach Chow.

41:17.675 --> 41:19.175
Good one. For a second there,

41:19.176 --> 41:20.844
I almost thought you were serious.

41:20.845 --> 41:23.313
- But I am serious.
- Brie, please.

41:23.314 --> 41:24.781
Mama, please!

41:24.782 --> 41:26.716
He lives in Des Moines, Iowa!

41:26.717 --> 41:28.885
Do you know how far
away that is from here?

41:28.886 --> 41:30.153
Go look it up on the map.

41:30.154 --> 41:32.822
I don't think you realize that's
over 1,000 miles away from here.

41:32.823 --> 41:34.757
Mama, I want to train
with Liang Chow!

41:34.758 --> 41:36.626
And how would you get
there, Gabrielle?

41:36.627 --> 41:38.761
Where would you live?
It's impossible.

41:38.762 --> 41:40.330
- It's not!
- Oh!

41:40.331 --> 41:43.032
And you have chutzpah.
Do you know what chutzpah is?

41:43.033 --> 41:44.778
Go look that one up, too.

41:45.302 --> 41:48.105
Mama, don't laugh at me.
I'm going to train with him.

41:48.405 --> 41:50.740
I don't care what you say.

41:50.741 --> 41:54.811
Gabrielle Douglas, who do you
think you are talking to?

41:54.812 --> 41:57.013
You better watch your
mouth, young lady.

41:57.014 --> 41:59.382
Talking under your breath like
you're some spoiled brat.

41:59.383 --> 42:01.685
Get up there and go
wash up for dinner.

42:04.588 --> 42:06.883
You done lost your mind.

42:08.392 --> 42:11.036
All right, let's try that again.

42:19.637 --> 42:22.205
Come on! Gabby! Pick up your feet.

42:22.206 --> 42:25.247
When you hit the mat in the Pak salto,
that's five-tenths off your score.

42:25.743 --> 42:27.176
Try it again.

42:27.177 --> 42:30.246
It's not working.
I've tried it 20 times.

42:30.247 --> 42:32.749
Well, maybe you're not trying
hard enough. Let's go.

42:32.750 --> 42:35.218
<i>I wanted to jump up
and yell right back,</i>

42:35.219 --> 42:37.620
<i>"Maybe you're not
teaching me right."</i>

42:37.621 --> 42:39.867
<i>But I wasn't raised that way.</i>

42:41.792 --> 42:46.438
<i>And then a mix-up with Chow's ride
to the airport gave me my last hope.</i>

42:47.631 --> 42:52.101
<i>My mom offered to take him, and I
knew that by the end of the ride,</i>

42:52.102 --> 42:55.872
<i>she would have gotten to know
him and realized I was right.</i>

43:05.082 --> 43:07.487
My daughter is very driven.

43:11.021 --> 43:13.392
Better that than her
driven parents.

43:15.292 --> 43:16.696
No offense.

43:16.794 --> 43:18.835
Mmm. None taken.

43:19.763 --> 43:23.340
I believe in letting all my
kids make their own choices.

43:24.301 --> 43:25.668
So, who inspired you?

43:25.669 --> 43:27.778
Your mother? Coach?

43:28.472 --> 43:30.046
Neither.

43:30.474 --> 43:32.342
I was taken out of
my school at five

43:32.343 --> 43:35.244
and put into a state program
for gifted athletes.

43:35.245 --> 43:37.914
In China, it's called <i>juguo tizhi.</i>

43:37.915 --> 43:40.583
It means "whole nation system."

43:40.584 --> 43:42.885
I only saw my family
three times a year.

43:42.886 --> 43:45.722
Hmm. You must have missed them.

43:45.723 --> 43:48.257
Of course.

43:48.258 --> 43:52.062
But even at that age, I knew
I had to make my country proud.

43:54.231 --> 43:56.943
Life isn't always easy in China.

43:58.902 --> 44:01.443
It's not always easy here, either.

44:02.006 --> 44:03.706
I can tell you some stories.

44:05.275 --> 44:07.510
What do you mean, small talk?

44:07.511 --> 44:11.347
Like how he came to
America, about his family.

44:11.348 --> 44:13.783
What about training me?

44:13.784 --> 44:17.720
Gabrielle, he lives in Iowa.
We live here.

44:17.721 --> 44:19.422
Mama, all that time together,

44:19.423 --> 44:23.432
and you didn't mention the most
important thing in the world?

44:24.328 --> 44:27.463
- Help me fold these clothes, Gabrielle.
- It isn't fair!

44:27.464 --> 44:29.699
Gabrielle, we're not
gonna keep doing this.

44:29.700 --> 44:31.868
Here. You fold your leos.

44:31.869 --> 44:33.302
Think about something else.

44:33.303 --> 44:35.471
No, I'm not gonna fold my leos.

44:35.472 --> 44:37.006
I don't need them anymore.

44:37.007 --> 44:39.844
If I can't train with Coach Chow,
then I'm not gonna do gymnastics.

44:40.377 --> 44:42.554
What's the point? I quit!

44:43.147 --> 44:45.654
And I don't want dinner ever!

44:49.586 --> 44:51.661
Well, you know what?

44:52.022 --> 44:53.960
You don't have to eat then.

45:03.834 --> 45:06.436
A hunger strike?

45:06.437 --> 45:09.338
Well, you got to give her
points for that drama.

45:09.339 --> 45:12.085
She hasn't spoken to me in a week.

45:12.142 --> 45:13.242
Oh.

45:13.243 --> 45:17.580
Gosh. When she gets her mind
set to something, it's like...

45:17.581 --> 45:19.148
Where does she get that from?

45:19.149 --> 45:21.217
Excuse me? Are you kidding?

45:21.218 --> 45:22.919
You better look in
the mirror, girl.

45:22.920 --> 45:27.156
No. No, no, I'm stubborn,
but Brie... No.

45:27.157 --> 45:30.426
That's a whole...
She's just, like, beyond.

45:30.427 --> 45:33.696
It's like she was put on
Earth for this one thing.

45:34.898 --> 45:36.933
Sometimes I lay in
bed, and I ask God,

45:36.934 --> 45:40.937
"Why? Why her? Why my
little Boo Tookie Boo?"

45:42.005 --> 45:45.343
She was so sick and nearly
died that first year,

45:45.943 --> 45:50.713
and out of all the little girls in this
whole, wide world, she was picked.

45:51.815 --> 45:53.788
And is it a gift or is it a burden?

45:54.151 --> 45:56.897
You know, you're the only
one who can answer that.

45:58.222 --> 46:02.197
Mom, I got four kids, and I'm
barely keeping it together.

46:02.659 --> 46:07.066
Here she is, this force of nature,
with dreams as big as the sky.

46:07.498 --> 46:11.644
Well, I remember walking in those
shoes myself not too long ago.

46:12.202 --> 46:15.949
You wanted to be a lawyer,
and until Arielle,

46:16.507 --> 46:18.809
it was what you lived for.

46:19.610 --> 46:23.289
And you would have
made a great lawyer.

46:23.814 --> 46:25.014
Hmm.

46:25.015 --> 46:27.226
But I'm gonna tell you.

46:27.651 --> 46:29.152
There's nothing worse for a mother

46:29.153 --> 46:32.627
than seeing her child's
dream go unanswered.

46:34.825 --> 46:37.605
Mom, I can't afford
to send her to Iowa.

46:38.729 --> 46:41.475
And you can't afford not to.

46:50.407 --> 46:53.210
- You see one yet?
- No.

46:54.444 --> 46:57.190
Some little ones over there,
but nothing's moving.

46:58.549 --> 47:01.557
I bet there are a lot
of stars in Iowa.

47:01.952 --> 47:06.489
You aren't going to Iowa. You might
as well stop thinking about it.

47:06.490 --> 47:09.125
Why would you say that?

47:09.126 --> 47:13.238
Well, 'cause for one, we live here.

47:14.498 --> 47:17.506
Two, you can't afford
to get out there.

47:17.935 --> 47:20.303
Three, even if you could
afford to get out there,

47:20.304 --> 47:22.405
you got no place to live.

47:22.406 --> 47:25.374
Four, I mean, if you went to Iowa,

47:25.375 --> 47:27.677
no one would be able to take
care of you like I could.

47:28.512 --> 47:31.180
- Five...
- Are you saying you're gonna miss me?

47:31.181 --> 47:34.655
- You would, wouldn't you?
- Hey, now, cut it out.

47:38.488 --> 47:40.324
Is that one?

47:40.991 --> 47:42.827
No, that's just a plane.

47:43.360 --> 47:44.866
Hmm.

47:45.762 --> 47:50.399
<i>As it turns out, my prayers were being
heard, and I didn't even know it.</i>

47:50.400 --> 47:51.901
<i>1,000 miles away,</i>

47:51.902 --> 47:55.775
<i>a family who didn't even know
me was about to change my life.</i>

47:57.074 --> 47:59.742
<i>Some people don't
believe in miracles.</i>

47:59.743 --> 48:01.911
If you find a girl who needs it...

48:01.912 --> 48:04.080
And we've already got
the four girls, right?

48:04.081 --> 48:09.763
I mean, what's one more if it means
helping someone reach their goal?

48:10.053 --> 48:11.593
Got the room.

48:12.022 --> 48:13.122
Thank you.

48:13.123 --> 48:15.558
<i>They call it a coincidence or luck.</i>

48:15.559 --> 48:17.770
<i>No, sir. Not me.</i>

48:18.395 --> 48:21.030
<i>When an impossible array
of stars all line up</i>

48:21.031 --> 48:25.501
<i>just so one puny, little human can reach
out and grab ah old of her dreams,</i>

48:25.502 --> 48:29.138
<i>it isn't just luck or a
coincidence at work.</i>

48:29.139 --> 48:32.208
<i>It's something much bigger
watching out for you.</i>

48:32.209 --> 48:34.310
Call him, Mom.

48:34.311 --> 48:36.479
I just don't know
how we would do it.

48:36.480 --> 48:38.781
I mean, money's already tight.

48:38.782 --> 48:40.283
And then on top of that...

48:40.284 --> 48:43.219
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling him for you.

48:43.220 --> 48:45.788
Okay, we walk by
faith, not by sight.

48:45.789 --> 48:47.730
Isn't that what you've
told us our whole lives?

48:47.958 --> 48:50.670
- Yes, it is what I've taught you...
- It's ringing.

48:52.396 --> 48:55.698
Hi. Yes, this is Natalie Hawkins.

48:55.699 --> 48:58.104
I'm calling to speak
with Coach Chow.

48:59.102 --> 49:01.279
Sure, sure. I'll hold.

49:03.006 --> 49:06.014
Yes, of course I remember her.

49:07.444 --> 49:08.745
Hmm.

49:10.013 --> 49:11.587
Mmm-hmm.

49:11.648 --> 49:16.090
No, I understand, not everyone could
just pick up and move to Iowa.

49:17.120 --> 49:20.731
Your daughter's an exceptional
athlete. I would...

49:21.992 --> 49:24.203
Mrs. Hawkins, if you...

49:26.663 --> 49:29.443
Can I just stop you for a minute?

49:30.100 --> 49:34.041
Believe it or not, I think I
might have a solution for you.

49:36.273 --> 49:38.280
They would let Gabrielle
stay with them?

49:39.543 --> 49:41.516
For two years?

49:42.646 --> 49:43.846
A family might host her.

49:43.847 --> 49:46.423
She would have a place to live.

49:46.984 --> 49:51.253
Um, yeah, I'll talk to her about it
when I pick her up this afternoon.

49:51.254 --> 49:53.693
Okay. All right. Thank you.

49:54.324 --> 49:56.262
Seriously?

49:57.494 --> 49:59.962
Some family wants to
do something nice.

49:59.963 --> 50:01.765
Oh, my God.

50:02.733 --> 50:04.307
Wow.

50:04.334 --> 50:07.672
- That's incredible.
- What did I just do?

50:10.941 --> 50:12.742
That whale's never gonna fit.

50:12.743 --> 50:16.812
Okay. So, do you like this sweater,
or do you like this one better?

50:16.813 --> 50:18.314
I don't know, Brie. Just pick one.

50:18.315 --> 50:20.950
You are not gonna be able
to pack all this stuff.

50:20.951 --> 50:23.953
Ah! I can't believe it.

50:23.954 --> 50:25.562
Breezy, you're really going.

50:26.256 --> 50:27.423
Iowa!

50:32.496 --> 50:36.243
Don't look at me like that.
You're gonna make me cry.

50:40.570 --> 50:43.282
I'm really gonna miss you.

50:43.774 --> 50:45.508
Come here.

50:45.509 --> 50:47.789
- I love you.
- I love you.

50:48.578 --> 50:50.780
Are you bringing that sweater?
I told you not to pack that.

50:50.781 --> 50:54.717
<i>What do you pack when you're leaving
home for the first time in your life,</i>

50:54.718 --> 50:59.989
<i>and no suitcase in the world is big enough
for what you want to take with you?</i>

50:59.990 --> 51:03.225
You're living my dream.
Do you know that?

51:03.226 --> 51:06.929
So, go up there and
be your best, okay?

51:06.930 --> 51:09.005
Come here.

51:11.601 --> 51:13.209
Bye, Joy.

51:16.039 --> 51:17.340
Gonna miss you.

51:18.141 --> 51:19.647
I'm gonna miss you more.

51:20.610 --> 51:22.014
John.

51:24.414 --> 51:27.716
- Oh, come on. Don't be like that.
- Brie. Brie.

51:27.717 --> 51:30.786
He'll call you later.
This is tough for him.

51:30.787 --> 51:34.125
We got to go. We don't
want to miss our flight.

51:36.726 --> 51:38.130
Bye, Zoway.

51:39.129 --> 51:40.703
Don't forget me when
I'm gone, okay?

52:02.452 --> 52:03.890
Where is everything?

52:07.090 --> 52:08.960
Zoway's gonna forget me.

52:09.326 --> 52:11.196
He won't forget you, sweetheart.

52:13.597 --> 52:15.934
Two years is a long time.

52:18.935 --> 52:20.441
Yes, it is.

52:28.612 --> 52:30.914
Coach, watch this!

52:31.348 --> 52:32.854
Nice!

52:37.754 --> 52:38.821
How was my line?

52:38.822 --> 52:42.569
Come on. You did it in competition.
You can do it again.

52:43.593 --> 52:46.567
- Don't step forward.
- Got it, Coach.

52:47.130 --> 52:49.501
Ella, you're about to dismount.
Concentrate.

52:50.901 --> 52:55.204
Gabby. This is my wife, Li.
She'll be coaching you, too.

52:55.205 --> 52:58.543
Welcome, Gabby. My husband
has told me so much about you.

52:59.176 --> 53:02.320
Now that you're here,
what do you think?

53:02.479 --> 53:04.258
Oh, it's...

53:04.614 --> 53:06.552
I can't even say.

53:07.417 --> 53:08.957
But it's what you wanted, right?

53:12.122 --> 53:14.732
I want to go to the Olympics.

53:15.091 --> 53:16.529
And I want to win.

53:19.563 --> 53:21.497
You haven't given us much time.

53:21.498 --> 53:23.332
London is just 22 months away.

53:23.333 --> 53:26.307
I'll give you 100% every day.

53:28.438 --> 53:30.139
I'd like to speak candidly.
Do you mind?

53:30.140 --> 53:31.612
Please.

53:33.643 --> 53:39.450
Every single person you see here has
the same dream, to go to the Olympics.

53:41.685 --> 53:45.821
That little girl, she's been
with me three years now.

53:45.822 --> 53:48.357
Her parents told me that the
first sentence she spoke

53:48.358 --> 53:50.535
was that she wanted to
win at the Olympics.

53:51.161 --> 53:53.964
I believe she'll get there one day.

53:55.699 --> 53:57.103
And me?

54:01.738 --> 54:05.679
I see the possibility of you getting to
the Olympics, but I can't guarantee it.

54:06.009 --> 54:09.313
Your difficulty level and physical
condition need a lot of upgrading.

54:09.846 --> 54:11.280
I don't know how hard you're
really willing to work.

54:11.281 --> 54:14.221
Oh, hard. I promise.

54:14.884 --> 54:16.720
Just...

54:18.388 --> 54:20.099
Just believe in me.

54:22.559 --> 54:24.099
We'll start tomorrow.

54:25.662 --> 54:27.129
You'll be doing 28 hours per week.

54:27.130 --> 54:29.865
At home, I do 36, and I'm
willing to do a lot...

54:29.866 --> 54:31.338
I have my way.

54:32.969 --> 54:34.509
Believe in me.

54:37.774 --> 54:39.246
You must be Gabby.

54:40.110 --> 54:42.745
I'm Sally, and this
is my husband, Brent.

54:42.746 --> 54:44.680
Welcome to Iowa.

54:44.681 --> 54:48.895
We are so grateful that you are
gonna let us be your host family.

54:50.186 --> 54:51.553
Is that her, Mommy?

54:51.554 --> 54:55.700
Yes, it is, princess. This is
Jessica, one of our girls.

54:59.829 --> 55:03.065
And this is Jill, and
our oldest, Connie,

55:03.066 --> 55:04.400
and our youngest, Beth-Anne,

55:04.401 --> 55:06.044
and you met Jessica, right?

55:08.038 --> 55:09.438
- So, how was the...
- You have a love...

55:09.439 --> 55:11.307
Oh, you first.

55:11.308 --> 55:13.942
I was just gonna say, you
guys have a lovely home.

55:13.943 --> 55:17.313
Thank you. Okay, so, who's hungry?

55:17.314 --> 55:18.681
Me!

55:18.682 --> 55:19.815
You guys are always hungry.

55:19.816 --> 55:23.188
- All right, to the kitchen. Come on in.
- Come in.

55:23.853 --> 55:25.454
Already beating us there.

55:25.455 --> 55:28.490
We are grateful for
bringing us together.

55:28.491 --> 55:32.161
And we want to
thank you, Lord Jesus,

55:32.162 --> 55:34.533
for bringing Gabby into our home.

55:35.498 --> 55:38.540
And, God, please bless our food.

55:39.636 --> 55:43.577
- In your name we pray. Amen.
- Amen.

55:48.011 --> 55:50.757
You girls are gonna give
them some time alone, okay?

55:52.449 --> 55:54.450
Is this a good idea?

55:54.451 --> 55:57.027
'Cause it's not feeling
like I thought it would.

55:57.921 --> 55:59.888
It's what you wanted, Brie.

55:59.889 --> 56:03.659
Mama, nobody said Iowa doesn't
have any black people.

56:04.527 --> 56:07.603
I'm sure there's more
of us somewhere.

56:11.568 --> 56:12.869
Don't go.

56:14.337 --> 56:17.117
It's too late for you to have
a change of heart now, baby.

56:18.408 --> 56:21.052
This will be the
hardest part, sweetie.

56:21.344 --> 56:26.616
Tomorrow, you'll be in your
element, where you belong.

56:28.685 --> 56:31.261
I'm so proud of you, I could pop.

56:34.491 --> 56:37.101
I love you, my Boo Tookie Boo.

56:37.127 --> 56:38.428
Mama.

56:38.595 --> 56:40.067
Oh...

56:40.697 --> 56:44.466
One more hug before I
start bawling my eyes out

56:44.467 --> 56:46.303
in front of all these nice people.

56:48.638 --> 56:49.705
I love you, sweetie.

56:49.706 --> 56:51.417
I love you.

57:10.000 --> 57:22.000
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:24.207 --> 57:25.952
Study this closely.

57:26.109 --> 57:30.679
These are the dates that are going to
control your life for the next two years.

57:30.680 --> 57:32.926
This is today.

57:34.350 --> 57:37.358
And this is the London Olympics.

57:37.821 --> 57:41.056
But you can't get there
unless you win here,

57:41.057 --> 57:42.734
the US Olympic Trials.

57:43.326 --> 57:45.294
There will be competitions
throughout the year.

57:45.295 --> 57:47.296
They're all important.

57:47.297 --> 57:53.240
But the road to there really starts
here, the Visa Championships.

57:54.471 --> 57:56.305
And starting now,

57:56.306 --> 57:58.847
you have to forget everything
you thought you knew.

57:59.876 --> 58:02.978
<i>Because I'm going to rebuild
you muscle by muscle.</i>

58:02.979 --> 58:04.746
<i>♪ Yeah, you can be the greatest</i>

58:04.747 --> 58:06.181
<i>♪ You can be the best</i>

58:06.182 --> 58:08.951

58:08.952 --> 58:11.920
<i>♪ You could beat the world
You could beat the war</i>

58:11.921 --> 58:14.790
<i>♪ You could talk to God,
go banging on his door</i>

58:14.791 --> 58:16.458
<i>♪ You can throw your hands up</i>

58:16.459 --> 58:17.893
<i>- ♪ You can beat the clock
- ♪ Yeah</i>

58:17.894 --> 58:20.362
<i>♪ You can move a mountain
You can break rocks</i>

58:20.363 --> 58:23.131
<i>♪ You can be a master
Don't wait for luck</i>

58:23.132 --> 58:25.367
<i>♪ Dedicate yourself and
you gonna find yourself</i>

58:25.368 --> 58:28.877
<i>- ♪ Standing the hall of fame
- ♪ Yeah</i>

58:30.406 --> 58:34.950
<i>- ♪ And the world's gonna know your name
- ♪ Yeah</i>

58:36.112 --> 58:40.588
<i>- ♪ 'Cause you burn with the brightest flame
- ♪ Yeah</i>

58:41.784 --> 58:45.964
<i>- ♪ And the world's gonna know your name
- ♪ Yeah</i>

58:46.389 --> 58:48.991
<i>♪ And you'll be on the
walls of the hall of fame</i>

58:48.992 --> 58:51.460
<i>♪ You can go the distance
You can run the mile</i>

58:51.461 --> 58:54.296
<i>♪ You can walk straight
through hell with a smile</i>

58:54.297 --> 58:56.899
<i>♪ You could be the hero
You could get the gold</i>

58:56.900 --> 58:59.735
<i>♪ Breaking all the records they
thought never could be broke</i>

58:59.736 --> 59:02.604
<i>♪ Yeah, do it for your people
Do it for your pride</i>

59:02.605 --> 59:05.774
<i>♪ How you ever gonna know
if you never even try?</i>

59:05.775 --> 59:08.243
<i>♪ Do it for your country
Do it for your name</i>

59:08.244 --> 59:10.445
<i>♪ 'Cause there's gonna be a day</i>

59:10.446 --> 59:14.057
<i>- ♪ When you're standing in the hall of fame
- ♪ Yeah</i>

59:15.351 --> 59:19.690
<i>- ♪ And the world's gonna know your name
- ♪ Yeah</i>

59:21.257 --> 59:25.403
<i>- ♪ 'Cause you burn with the brightest flame
- ♪ Yeah</i>

59:26.930 --> 59:31.007
<i>- ♪ And the world's gonna know your name
- ♪ Yeah ♪</i>

59:32.001 --> 59:36.104
<i>Mom was right. Saying goodbye
to her was the hardest part.</i>

59:36.105 --> 59:39.011
<i>Before I knew it,
months had passed.</i>

59:51.387 --> 59:54.827
<i>I gained 10 pounds,
and it was all muscle.</i>

59:55.158 --> 59:58.460
<i>Every skill I thought
I knew was rethought.</i>

59:58.461 --> 01:00:02.470
<i>Routines I never believed I
could do became second nature.</i>

01:00:08.271 --> 01:00:09.371
<i>With Chow,</i>

01:00:09.372 --> 01:00:13.984
<i>I competed against the best gymnasts
in this country and internationally.</i>

01:00:29.659 --> 01:00:32.394
<i>Then it was time to
put it all together.</i>

01:00:32.395 --> 01:00:34.763
<i>The Olympics were just a year away.</i>

01:00:34.764 --> 01:00:37.332
<i>The Visa Nationals were the
first of the competitions</i>

01:00:37.333 --> 01:00:39.701
<i>that would decide
who makes the team.</i>

01:00:39.702 --> 01:00:43.114
<i>As Chow said, it was make
it or break it time.</i>

01:00:44.841 --> 01:00:48.122
Right here, Gabby. Your body
shouldn't be hollow here.

01:00:48.344 --> 01:00:51.046
You need to open up a little
more in your rib cage.

01:00:51.047 --> 01:00:53.849
When you push off here,
your ankles will be springs,

01:00:53.850 --> 01:00:56.960
but your spine reaches, like this.

01:00:57.253 --> 01:00:58.793
- Hmm?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:00:59.022 --> 01:01:01.324
And don't be so serious.

01:01:01.958 --> 01:01:04.499
Don't force your body to
do what it already knows.

01:01:05.361 --> 01:01:07.197
Relax, right?

01:01:08.064 --> 01:01:12.210
Focused but relaxed.
So grace can enter the skill.

01:01:12.669 --> 01:01:14.175
Right?

01:01:15.171 --> 01:01:16.973
Let me see.

01:01:29.118 --> 01:01:32.092
Yes, Gabby! Like that! Again.

01:01:43.366 --> 01:01:44.933
Gabby!

01:01:46.436 --> 01:01:47.737
Gabby!

01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:51.049
Don't move. Don't move.
Don't move. Get some ice.

01:02:01.451 --> 01:02:03.389
It's her hamstring.

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:14.273
<i>In my mind, I kept hearing the
sound of my hamstring popping.</i>

01:02:15.064 --> 01:02:18.470
<i>It was the sound of my
dreams starting to unravel.</i>

01:02:29.779 --> 01:02:31.114
Gabby?

01:02:31.914 --> 01:02:35.423
I can't fall behind. Coach
Chow told me to rest tonight.

01:02:36.619 --> 01:02:38.694
Don't tell him, okay?

01:02:46.329 --> 01:02:48.430
What is it?

01:02:48.431 --> 01:02:52.679
Pure determination,
dressed up like a teenager.

01:03:12.555 --> 01:03:14.523
<i>I don't want to
foreshadow anything here,</i>

01:03:14.524 --> 01:03:18.827
<i>but she has not just this week,</i>

01:03:18.828 --> 01:03:23.765
<i>but in warm-ups today, really
had a tough go on the beam.</i>

01:03:23.766 --> 01:03:26.046
Come on, Breezy girl. Come on.

01:03:27.537 --> 01:03:28.872
Let's go.

01:03:39.382 --> 01:03:41.817
<i>Gabrielle, we're not
gonna keep doing this.</i>

01:03:46.022 --> 01:03:48.393
<i>Unless you're too short.</i>

01:03:52.195 --> 01:03:54.941
<i>But it's what you wanted, right?</i>

01:04:07.343 --> 01:04:11.046
<i>And the momentum is really
not going the right way</i>

01:04:11.047 --> 01:04:13.224
<i>for her tonight as well.</i>

01:04:26.529 --> 01:04:28.570
<i>Another big skill.</i>

01:04:31.167 --> 01:04:36.712
<i>This is one of those meets that is, quite
frankly, very hard to recover from.</i>

01:05:03.666 --> 01:05:07.369
<i>It's not just a matter of, you
know, having some problems.</i>

01:05:07.370 --> 01:05:10.138
<i>This is letting it
really get to you</i>

01:05:10.139 --> 01:05:14.809
<i>and letting the emotions
completely control your actions,</i>

01:05:14.810 --> 01:05:17.920
<i>and just badness all around.</i>

01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:47.676
Another competition, and you'll
get your confidence back.

01:05:47.677 --> 01:05:49.115
It's not that.

01:05:50.146 --> 01:05:51.891
It's just...

01:05:52.982 --> 01:05:55.383
It was make it or break it time,

01:05:55.384 --> 01:05:56.992
and I let everyone down.

01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:58.687
No, you did not let anyone...

01:05:58.688 --> 01:06:01.366
I saw it in Chow's face.

01:06:03.159 --> 01:06:06.497
After everything
everyone's done for me.

01:06:07.596 --> 01:06:11.666
My sisters, they gave up their
sports just so I could do mine.

01:06:11.667 --> 01:06:13.969
And my mother...

01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:15.303
We were on food stamps,

01:06:15.304 --> 01:06:17.982
and she always found a way
for me to keep training.

01:06:18.808 --> 01:06:20.642
They're all real proud
of you, honey. Nobody...

01:06:20.643 --> 01:06:22.081
And my brother...

01:06:24.513 --> 01:06:28.659
I'm, like, his best friend,
and he's mine, and I left him.

01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:33.363
I let everyone down.

01:06:37.893 --> 01:06:41.766
Sports isn't always
about winning, Gabby.

01:06:42.264 --> 01:06:44.874
It's about finding out
who you really are.

01:06:46.335 --> 01:06:53.450
Sometimes the only way to get
stronger is to get knocked down.

01:07:00.149 --> 01:07:03.794
Your mom is gonna be
here in four months.

01:07:05.087 --> 01:07:08.527
Isn't that something
to look forward to?

01:07:09.392 --> 01:07:11.926
She's pretty darned excited.

01:07:11.927 --> 01:07:13.638
It's all she talks about.

01:07:13.829 --> 01:07:16.666
Heck, we're all
pretty darn excited.

01:07:19.835 --> 01:07:21.808
We're really proud of you, Gabby.

01:07:23.506 --> 01:07:25.507
<i>As those four months went by,</i>

01:07:25.508 --> 01:07:30.120
<i>I had the aching awareness that who
I really was did not belong there.</i>

01:07:30.746 --> 01:07:34.357
<i>And after a while, I couldn't
think of anything else.</i>

01:07:35.518 --> 01:07:39.322
<i>Who I really was
wanted to go home.</i>

01:07:41.157 --> 01:07:43.198
Concentrate, Gabby.

01:07:45.094 --> 01:07:47.028
Think of the skill piece by piece.

01:07:47.029 --> 01:07:49.331
The key is to keep
your hips square.

01:07:49.665 --> 01:07:50.932
Hmm?

01:07:50.933 --> 01:07:52.268
Again.

01:07:53.769 --> 01:07:59.314
Where are you going, Gabby?
Don't do this. Gabby! Gabby.

01:08:01.844 --> 01:08:03.782
I know how hard it can be.

01:08:05.247 --> 01:08:07.925
For two years, you've trusted
everything I've told you, right?

01:08:09.452 --> 01:08:11.219
Now trust this.

01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:15.662
The only thing harder than what
you're feeling now is quitting.

01:08:16.492 --> 01:08:17.759
It's not working.

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:20.370
- What isn't working?
- Everything.

01:08:21.863 --> 01:08:24.631
You can be the best in the world.

01:08:24.633 --> 01:08:28.437
Did you hear those words?
"Best in the world."

01:08:29.004 --> 01:08:33.377
But you have to block out all of the
distractions and believe in yourself.

01:08:33.676 --> 01:08:37.612
Stay and work this out,

01:08:37.613 --> 01:08:41.292
and you will be an athlete
who inspires nations.

01:08:42.084 --> 01:08:46.254
Walk away, and you'll
be sitting on the couch

01:08:46.255 --> 01:08:49.263
watching someone else
win your Olympic medal.

01:08:55.965 --> 01:08:59.109
You'll regret this the
rest of your life.

01:09:02.738 --> 01:09:07.009
<i>Following my dreams was supposed
to lead me to who I really was.</i>

01:09:08.511 --> 01:09:12.314
<i>But who I really was, was lost.</i>

01:09:22.390 --> 01:09:24.893
Gabrielle, Coach Chow said
you were looking for me,

01:09:24.894 --> 01:09:27.428
said you wanted to talk
to me about something.

01:09:27.429 --> 01:09:28.729
Uh-uh.

01:09:29.064 --> 01:09:30.298
Uh-uh?

01:09:30.299 --> 01:09:32.169
You weren't looking for me?

01:09:33.035 --> 01:09:36.747
No. Talk. I can't talk about it.

01:09:37.973 --> 01:09:39.343
Is everything okay?

01:09:41.510 --> 01:09:43.551
Can we go someplace quiet?

01:09:45.648 --> 01:09:47.221
What's going on?

01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:51.393
I didn't have the nerve to
tell you, so I wrote it.

01:09:56.959 --> 01:10:01.264
The Olympics are exactly 210
days away, and you want to quit?

01:10:02.231 --> 01:10:03.498
Is this a joke?

01:10:03.499 --> 01:10:05.779
No, I want to go home.

01:10:07.469 --> 01:10:11.615
Gabrielle, is there something going on
here that you're not telling me about?

01:10:12.441 --> 01:10:14.542
Then you're gonna have to do
better than, "I want to go home."

01:10:14.543 --> 01:10:17.612
Because this is not
making any sense.

01:10:17.613 --> 01:10:19.688
I just want to be normal, Ma.

01:10:19.882 --> 01:10:22.684
Baby, you weren't
born to be normal.

01:10:22.685 --> 01:10:26.831
Everything you've done your
entire life has been exceptional.

01:10:27.056 --> 01:10:30.491
No. No. You are not gonna quit. No.

01:10:30.492 --> 01:10:33.228
You have worked too hard
for this, Gabrielle.

01:10:33.229 --> 01:10:35.697
We have sacrificed
so much for this.

01:10:35.698 --> 01:10:37.443
And now you want to quit?

01:10:38.067 --> 01:10:39.834
Exceptional people don't just quit.

01:10:39.835 --> 01:10:42.170
I don't want to be exceptional!

01:10:42.171 --> 01:10:44.576
I don't want to go to the Olympics!

01:10:48.510 --> 01:10:50.050
Does Coach Chow know?

01:10:50.646 --> 01:10:53.581
No. Can you tell him?

01:10:53.582 --> 01:10:57.285
Oh! Oh! Oh!

01:10:57.286 --> 01:10:58.894
Gabrielle!

01:11:00.222 --> 01:11:02.257
You signed a contract.

01:11:02.258 --> 01:11:04.560
What you're doing is dishonorable.

01:11:06.061 --> 01:11:08.596
If you want to quit, you
tell Coach Chow yourself,

01:11:08.597 --> 01:11:13.107
and after that, you tell everybody
else whose heart you're gonna break.

01:11:22.811 --> 01:11:27.355
And I've told her, look at all the
people that have sacrificed for you,

01:11:27.816 --> 01:11:30.585
Sally and Brent,
your brother and sisters,

01:11:30.586 --> 01:11:33.454
your entire life, Miss Carolyn, me.

01:11:33.455 --> 01:11:36.958
I know, Mom! I can get a
job and pay you back.

01:11:36.959 --> 01:11:39.637
No, Gabrielle, you
cannot pay me back!

01:11:40.029 --> 01:11:42.697
Paying me back would be following
through on your life's dream,

01:11:42.698 --> 01:11:45.342
and you just want to
throw it all away!

01:11:45.367 --> 01:11:48.736
You think there aren't other little girls
out there who miss their families?

01:11:48.737 --> 01:11:50.345
She is gifted.

01:11:51.073 --> 01:11:52.774
One of the best in the sport.

01:11:52.775 --> 01:11:55.783
I know that. And she
knows that, too.

01:11:56.745 --> 01:11:59.924
But an Olympic athlete is
more than talent and muscle.

01:12:01.850 --> 01:12:04.721
If she doesn't have it in
her heart, it isn't there.

01:12:05.554 --> 01:12:08.858
We can't teach it.
You can't force it.

01:12:10.726 --> 01:12:13.370
And even Gabby can't
make it any different.

01:12:16.598 --> 01:12:19.902
A champion isn't made of muscle.

01:12:22.671 --> 01:12:24.917
A champion is made of heart.

01:12:34.650 --> 01:12:37.652
We'll give her some time
to figure this out.

01:12:37.653 --> 01:12:40.524
If she wants to quit, she will.

01:12:41.557 --> 01:12:45.526
Meanwhile, she's been accepted
to the AT&T American Cup.

01:12:45.527 --> 01:12:48.229
She's just an alternate,
so the points won't count.

01:12:48.230 --> 01:12:51.602
There won't be any pressure on her.

01:12:59.842 --> 01:13:01.242
<i>Stupid.</i>

01:13:01.243 --> 01:13:05.012
What did you just say?
Did you just call me stupid?

01:13:05.013 --> 01:13:07.673
Yeah, what do you think it's called
when you give up for nothing?

01:13:07.983 --> 01:13:11.526
It's not for nothing.
I want to come home.

01:13:12.321 --> 01:13:15.465
You're living your dream.
You can't give up now.

01:13:15.791 --> 01:13:18.332
- I know, but...
<i>- No buts, okay?</i>

01:13:18.660 --> 01:13:21.829
I mean, athletes don't
whine and complain.

01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:23.464
My coach brings me
through hell and back,

01:13:23.465 --> 01:13:25.166
and you know what? I love it.

01:13:25.167 --> 01:13:27.168
'Cause it makes me better.

01:13:27.169 --> 01:13:29.604
Now, you got to tough it out.
It's the life of an athlete.

01:13:29.605 --> 01:13:33.374
John, I want to come home.
I want to be with everyone.

01:13:33.375 --> 01:13:35.712
<i>Brie, listen to me.</i>

01:13:36.078 --> 01:13:37.482
Are you listening?

01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:39.784
Mmm-hmm.

01:13:40.482 --> 01:13:42.283
You are with everyone.

01:13:42.284 --> 01:13:44.185
<i>I mean, we're right
there with you.</i>

01:13:44.186 --> 01:13:45.686
<i>And when you go up there
to get your medals,</i>

01:13:45.687 --> 01:13:47.255
we're gonna be right up there, too.

01:13:47.256 --> 01:13:49.001
<i>Can't you see that?</i>

01:13:49.525 --> 01:13:52.527
You're winning for all of us.

01:13:52.528 --> 01:13:54.988
You didn't think you were doing
it all on your own, did you?

01:13:56.799 --> 01:13:58.635
Look, you get that
thing that I sent you?

01:13:59.401 --> 01:14:02.705
The thing I'm not allowed
to open? Yeah.

01:14:03.672 --> 01:14:05.212
You can open it now.

01:14:20.556 --> 01:14:23.803
"Today should always be
better than yesterday."

01:14:24.326 --> 01:14:26.367
It's our family saying, Brie.

01:14:27.095 --> 01:14:29.466
If you live by that, then
we'll always be together.

01:14:30.098 --> 01:14:32.439
<i>'Cause no matter where you
are, you can take us with you.</i>

01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:36.913
You get that other thing?

01:14:48.750 --> 01:14:50.154
All right.

01:14:50.686 --> 01:14:53.654
<i>Now put it on the board
where you can see it.</i>

01:14:53.655 --> 01:14:55.866
Don't quit on us, Brie.

01:14:59.528 --> 01:15:01.273
And again.

01:15:01.597 --> 01:15:03.397
Okay, and point the toe more.

01:15:03.398 --> 01:15:04.699
Good.

01:15:04.867 --> 01:15:07.647
What's the most important
thing about gymnastics?

01:15:08.437 --> 01:15:09.570
Beautiful!

01:15:09.571 --> 01:15:15.116
The most important thing about
gymnastics is, it's fun! Yes!

01:15:40.402 --> 01:15:41.969
<i>And what we're seeing here tonight,</i>

01:15:41.970 --> 01:15:44.305
<i>well, 21 weeks before the Olympics,</i>

01:15:44.306 --> 01:15:46.974
<i>Gabby Douglas isn't even
officially competing.</i>

01:15:46.975 --> 01:15:50.478
<i>Right now, she's leading the top two
US gymnasts in this competition.</i>

01:15:50.479 --> 01:15:52.280
<i>She's attempting the
two and a half here.</i>

01:15:52.281 --> 01:15:56.517
<i>It's also called the Amanar vault, one
of the hardest in the competition.</i>

01:15:56.518 --> 01:15:59.128
<i>It's her first time
trying it in exhibition.</i>

01:16:07.496 --> 01:16:10.431
<i>Ooh! She nailed it! Gabby Douglas!</i>

01:16:20.175 --> 01:16:22.543
<i>And right from the first
workout here in New York,</i>

01:16:22.544 --> 01:16:25.791
<i>we knew there was something
very different about Gabby.</i>

01:16:54.343 --> 01:16:58.147
<i>The growth in this young lady
is absolutely spectacular.</i>

01:16:58.814 --> 01:17:00.525
<i>Watch this dismount.</i>

01:17:29.845 --> 01:17:32.079
<i>Leading the top two US gymnasts</i>

01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:35.259
<i>by a full two tenths
as an alternate,</i>

01:17:35.617 --> 01:17:38.158
<i>this is one for the storybooks.</i>

01:18:00.242 --> 01:18:02.643
<i>And here it is, her final pass.</i>

01:18:02.644 --> 01:18:04.946
<i>You can feel the
excitement in here.</i>

01:18:12.921 --> 01:18:16.600
<i>Well, it all comes down to the
Olympic Trials in three months.</i>

01:18:16.692 --> 01:18:19.939
<i>Can she do this again
when the points count?</i>

01:18:28.437 --> 01:18:29.807
Good.

01:18:36.645 --> 01:18:38.151
Good.

01:18:42.617 --> 01:18:44.089
Less kick here.

01:18:48.356 --> 01:18:50.294
You were a little
late on the release.

01:18:50.492 --> 01:18:52.426
What if I can't?

01:18:52.427 --> 01:18:53.794
The bars have become
your best event.

01:18:53.795 --> 01:18:55.629
You've done the high
release a million times.

01:18:55.630 --> 01:18:59.969
No. What if they're right? What
if I do cave under pressure?

01:19:01.770 --> 01:19:03.671
What if the bar just wasn't there?

01:19:03.672 --> 01:19:06.077
You can't think of it like that.

01:19:09.644 --> 01:19:12.322
I'm going to tell you the
secret of gymnastics.

01:19:12.881 --> 01:19:14.548
Now?

01:19:14.549 --> 01:19:16.658
Why not two years ago?

01:19:17.185 --> 01:19:18.691
You weren't ready then.

01:19:22.357 --> 01:19:26.360
You can't think of it as release
the bar, catch the bar.

01:19:26.361 --> 01:19:29.697
There's no release.
There's no catch.

01:19:29.698 --> 01:19:31.534
Because it's all one.

01:19:33.435 --> 01:19:35.569
When you are in your moment,

01:19:35.570 --> 01:19:39.039
when you are doing exactly what
you're supposed to be doing,

01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:40.614
it's all one.

01:19:40.876 --> 01:19:44.612
You are not reaching for the bar,
because you've already got it.

01:19:44.613 --> 01:19:47.815
Know that in the deepest
part of your being.

01:19:47.816 --> 01:19:50.551
There's no past, no future.

01:19:50.552 --> 01:19:54.095
You are the bar. You are
the air. You are the catch.

01:19:54.222 --> 01:19:56.695
You are the eyes on you.

01:19:56.892 --> 01:19:58.933
It's all one reality.

01:20:03.098 --> 01:20:05.708
Every moment of your
life has led to this.

01:20:06.868 --> 01:20:09.011
It's all part of this.

01:20:09.871 --> 01:20:10.000
You are not separate from
the skill. You are the skill.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:13.675

Sounds like fate.

01:20:25.687 --> 01:20:27.193
Maybe.

01:20:29.257 --> 01:20:31.093
I call it gymnastics.

01:20:49.477 --> 01:20:52.446
<i>Four skills. Four chances to show</i>

01:20:52.447 --> 01:20:56.917
<i>they've got what it takes to represent
the USA in the Olympic Games.</i>

01:20:56.918 --> 01:21:00.461
<i>For each of these athletes,
it's a lifelong dream.</i>

01:21:14.803 --> 01:21:17.171
<i>There's no past, no future.</i>

01:21:17.172 --> 01:21:19.573

<i>Gabby Douglas takes the
top spot in these Trials</i>

01:22:48.496 --> 01:22:52.300
<i>and will be representing
Team USA in the Olympics!</i>

01:22:52.801 --> 01:22:55.809
USA! USA!

01:22:59.908 --> 01:23:01.312
You did it.

01:23:01.943 --> 01:23:03.415
We did it.

01:23:03.745 --> 01:23:06.616
