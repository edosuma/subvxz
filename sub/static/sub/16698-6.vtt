00:01.066 --> 00:02.734
How long do we have to
keep him here?

00:02.767 --> 00:05.038
Till the Cubs
win the world series.

00:05.070 --> 00:06.638
It could be a while.

00:06.671 --> 00:09.741
All right. Everything's
going to be all right.

00:09.775 --> 00:11.477
We'll take
good care of you.

00:11.509 --> 00:12.778
First of all,

00:12.811 --> 00:14.746
we're gonna get you
a new place to live.

00:14.779 --> 00:16.515
We're gonna get you
a new job.

00:16.548 --> 00:18.417
And we're gonna even
give you a new name.

00:18.451 --> 00:19.753
Your name now is Ed.

00:20.853 --> 00:22.288
Ed...

00:22.321 --> 00:24.290
Game blower.

00:24.323 --> 00:26.359
I'm sorry.
I'm still a little raw.

00:26.391 --> 00:28.760
How about
Ed Dream wrecker?

00:28.794 --> 00:30.295
No, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

00:30.329 --> 00:32.298
Wait, Jim,
your keys.

00:37.536 --> 00:39.172
Don't you ever learn?

00:41.000 --> 00:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here

00:51.484 --> 00:52.719
JIM: Oh, baby.

01:01.493 --> 01:06.331
Okay, Ruby,
four times nine is...

01:06.899 --> 01:08.134
Uh... 49?

01:11.170 --> 01:12.204
Forty-two?

01:12.871 --> 01:14.573
Thirty-six?

01:12.871 --> 01:14.573
(GASPS)

01:14.606 --> 01:15.707
Thirty-eight?

01:15.740 --> 01:17.109
(GROANS)

01:18.343 --> 01:20.312
What? You had it!

01:20.346 --> 01:21.881
Ruby, I gave you
the thumbs-up!

01:21.914 --> 01:23.750
I thought you meant
go higher!

01:25.751 --> 01:28.221
Dana, you can't
help her with
the answers!

01:28.254 --> 01:29.856
Cheryl, I can't help it.
It's so painful to watch,

01:29.888 --> 01:32.759
like Jim trying to pick
which fork to use
at a fancy restaurant.

01:34.859 --> 01:37.230
Mommy, I don't want
to do this anymore.

01:37.263 --> 01:38.597
Can we stop?

01:38.631 --> 01:40.399
No. No, honey,
you have to
learn this.

01:40.432 --> 01:42.534
The SAT's
are less than
10 years away.

01:44.503 --> 01:46.371
Cheryl, my love,

01:46.405 --> 01:47.873
I'm in
the coupon section here,

01:47.906 --> 01:50.342
and I don't see
anything cut out.

01:50.376 --> 01:52.478
I mean,
we got mac and cheese,

01:52.510 --> 01:55.147
party mix, generic pop...
You missed everything.

01:56.781 --> 01:58.584
We're trying to do
homework in here.

01:58.617 --> 02:00.219
Oh, come on, you've been
at it for an hour.

02:00.251 --> 02:02.721
How long can
a second grader's
homework take?

02:02.754 --> 02:04.589
I mean, Columbus sailed
the ocean blue,

02:04.623 --> 02:06.526
something something,
tie my shoe.

02:08.425 --> 02:10.362
Look, this is
second grade math.

02:10.395 --> 02:12.197
If she doesn't get this now,
she's gonna fall behind.

02:12.230 --> 02:13.632
I know, and then
she's going to end up

02:13.665 --> 02:16.468
living in a bus station
behind the candy machine!

02:16.502 --> 02:17.570
Come on!

02:17.603 --> 02:18.938
Would you let me
handle this?

02:18.971 --> 02:20.673
Educating the girls
should be my department.

02:20.705 --> 02:21.875
What...

02:22.875 --> 02:24.310
Why?

02:24.342 --> 02:25.510
Well...

02:25.544 --> 02:27.880
(STAMMERING)
Why? Why? Why?

02:27.913 --> 02:29.915
Why, because
you think you're
smarter than me?

02:29.949 --> 02:31.217
Is that what
you're saying?

02:31.250 --> 02:32.485
That's what
everybody's saying.

02:34.819 --> 02:37.256
What? You were in the
National Honor Society.

02:37.288 --> 02:39.625
Well, it's not
something I like to
go on and on about.

02:39.657 --> 02:42.528
I mean, it was automatic
if you got straight A's.

02:43.262 --> 02:44.563
Every year.

02:45.764 --> 02:46.933
Four years in a row.

02:48.467 --> 02:50.236
Wow. What'd you get, Jim?

02:50.269 --> 02:53.573
I got a career,
I got a house,

02:53.605 --> 02:56.175
and I got
an honors student
who brings me beer.

03:00.579 --> 03:01.814
All right, Ruby, sweetie,

03:01.847 --> 03:02.848
we've got to get back
to these flash cards.

03:02.882 --> 03:05.418
We still have to do our
five and six times tables.

03:05.450 --> 03:07.419
I hate math.

03:05.450 --> 03:07.419
(GASPS)

03:07.453 --> 03:08.888
I wish math would die.

03:10.288 --> 03:12.724
Ruby, don't say that.

03:12.758 --> 03:15.394
Math can be
an incredible adventure.

03:15.426 --> 03:18.197
(LAUGHING) Not when
you're teaching it.

03:19.764 --> 03:21.533
Come on,
she's like me.

03:21.567 --> 03:22.968
She's not
a flash card person.

03:23.002 --> 03:25.371
Maybe she likes to
have a little fun
with it.

03:25.403 --> 03:27.372
Yeah, I don't think so.

03:27.406 --> 03:29.808
You know what the problem
with you hoity-toity
honors society people is?

03:29.842 --> 03:31.877
You always think
your way is the best way.

03:31.909 --> 03:34.813
(GIGGLING)
Daddy, you said toity.

03:36.914 --> 03:40.485
Yes, I did. See?
I already have
her interest.

03:40.519 --> 03:41.987
All right,
you think you can do
better than I can?

03:42.020 --> 03:43.455
Yes, I can.

03:43.489 --> 03:45.491
Oh, Cheryl,
let him do it.
This'll be a hoot.

03:46.025 --> 03:47.526
Fine. You do it.

03:47.558 --> 03:49.262
I will.

03:49.294 --> 03:50.795
And I'll make it fun.

03:50.829 --> 03:53.733
Because nobody learns
anything without
entertainment.

03:53.765 --> 03:55.634
That's why Vegas
is so popular.

03:58.037 --> 03:59.906
JIM: Okay, now...

04:01.507 --> 04:04.243
I've got two handfuls
of marshmallows

04:05.443 --> 04:07.346
in uncle Andy's mouth.

04:08.514 --> 04:09.983
Nine in each handful.

04:14.052 --> 04:16.555
Two times nine is...

04:17.055 --> 04:18.290
Eighteen?

04:18.324 --> 04:20.492
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!
Yes, yes!

04:20.526 --> 04:21.894
Okay, okay,
okay, okay.

04:21.927 --> 04:25.765
So I put another nine
in Andy's mouth,

04:25.798 --> 04:27.766
what does it
come out to?

04:27.800 --> 04:28.867
Ah, great.

04:29.701 --> 04:30.969
What are you doing?

04:31.737 --> 04:33.406
All right, listen.

04:33.439 --> 04:37.410
So if two times nine is 18,

04:37.442 --> 04:40.279
three times nine is...

04:40.913 --> 04:42.415
Fourteen?

04:40.913 --> 04:42.415
No.

04:44.083 --> 04:45.852
Not less, Ruby.

04:47.685 --> 04:49.055
Twenty-seven.

04:49.088 --> 04:51.891
Three times nine is 27.

04:53.459 --> 04:55.427
So, what's
three times nine?

04:56.427 --> 04:57.529
Um...

04:58.831 --> 04:59.932
You've got to be
kidding me!

04:59.964 --> 05:01.633
He just said it!
He just...

05:01.666 --> 05:03.368
Back off!
Back off! Back off!

05:03.401 --> 05:04.603
She's just not
getting it, Jim!

05:04.636 --> 05:06.105
I know
she's not getting it.

05:06.137 --> 05:08.673
And I ate
two times five hot dogs,
eight times 10 French fries,

05:08.706 --> 05:10.076
and two-thirds of a pie!

05:10.108 --> 05:11.710
We didn't do fractions!

05:12.877 --> 05:14.346
I know. I like pie.

05:16.081 --> 05:17.383
All right,
come on, honey.

05:17.415 --> 05:19.084
Honey, I love you
so much. I really do.

05:19.117 --> 05:20.752
But we got to
get going here.

05:20.786 --> 05:22.420
Otherwise, it's going
to be all night...

05:22.454 --> 05:23.855
No, no, no, no. Come on.
Just let Cheryl do it.

05:23.889 --> 05:25.591
I'm not gonna let
Cheryl do it!

05:25.624 --> 05:28.427
Ruby's still got five more
of these stupid worksheets!

05:28.459 --> 05:29.495
Five?

05:29.528 --> 05:32.932
Oh, I hate math.
I wish it would die.

05:32.964 --> 05:35.834
Do you remember getting
this much homework
in the second grade?

05:35.867 --> 05:37.969
Second grade was all about
boogers and paste.

05:40.505 --> 05:42.774
Ruby, how come you have
so many worksheets?

05:42.807 --> 05:46.045
Mrs. Taylor makes us
bring home what we can't
finish in class.

05:46.077 --> 05:48.413
I try to go fast,
but that makes it
even harder.

05:48.447 --> 05:51.117
Oh, God, you sound
just like me
when I was in school.

05:51.149 --> 05:53.819
Do the numbers
spin around in your head
and swear at you?

05:55.521 --> 05:56.556
No.

05:58.089 --> 05:59.125
Oh.

06:00.125 --> 06:01.994
I'm tired!

06:02.026 --> 06:04.629
No, no, no, no, honey.
We got to keep going.
We got to keep going.

06:04.663 --> 06:07.066
You know what used to
help me with numbers
and stuff?

06:07.098 --> 06:09.735
Is, like, a rhyme or a song
or something like that.

06:09.767 --> 06:11.603
Give me the beat.
Give me a beat.
Give me a beat.

06:11.637 --> 06:13.072
(BEATBOXING)

06:16.841 --> 06:19.978

06:30.788 --> 06:32.759
Eleven? No.
No, no, baby, no.

06:36.694 --> 06:37.764
Uh, Mrs. Taylor?

06:38.863 --> 06:41.032
Hi, I'm Jim.
I'm Ruby's father.

06:41.065 --> 06:44.169
Well, hi, there, dad.

06:44.202 --> 06:46.938
Oh, your Ruby
is such a joy.

06:46.971 --> 06:49.875
Ah, thank you, thank you.
Can we talk about
her homework?

06:49.908 --> 06:52.778
Ah, dad likes to get
right to the point.

06:54.079 --> 06:55.781
Uh, could you not
call me dad?

06:55.814 --> 06:56.983
It's kind of
freaking me out
a little bit.

06:58.216 --> 07:00.051
Listen, uh,
Mrs. Taylor,

07:00.084 --> 07:02.020
I don't want to
tell you how to do
your job, okay,

07:02.053 --> 07:04.723
but what you're doing
is totally wrong.

07:05.958 --> 07:08.060
I mean, you know,
these kids talk.

07:08.093 --> 07:09.194
And the word
on the playground

07:09.228 --> 07:12.665
is that you're
kind of a hard ass.

07:12.697 --> 07:15.935
Yes, I've read that
on some of
the bathroom walls.

07:15.968 --> 07:18.037
Well, I think
you're giving Ruby
way too much homework.

07:18.069 --> 07:19.538
Can you cut back
a little bit?

07:19.571 --> 07:21.040
I'm sorry.
My hands are tied.

07:21.072 --> 07:23.209
I have to follow
the state's curriculum.

07:23.242 --> 07:25.811
Maybe Ruby needs
a little more help
with her homework.

07:25.843 --> 07:27.745
No, no, no, no,
but I am helping her.

07:27.778 --> 07:30.850
I'm up all night.
I can't do that anymore.

07:30.882 --> 07:32.717
Well, what about your wife?
Can't she help?

07:32.750 --> 07:34.686
No, no, no, no, she...
No, she can't do that.

07:34.720 --> 07:36.255
No, no.
No, she can't help.

07:36.288 --> 07:38.124
Is there a problem
with your wife?

07:43.295 --> 07:44.629
Yes.

07:45.930 --> 07:47.632
Would you like to
talk about it?

07:50.735 --> 07:52.805
No, it's, uh...
It's kind of personal.

07:52.838 --> 07:54.840
Well, that's
why we're here.

07:54.872 --> 07:56.908
If there's
a situation at home,

07:56.942 --> 07:59.812
I can make an exception
and lighten Ruby's workload.

07:59.845 --> 08:02.581
Oh, that's great.
Thank you so much.

08:02.613 --> 08:05.216
But I would need to know
exactly why your wife

08:05.250 --> 08:06.851
is unable to help
your daughter.

08:06.884 --> 08:10.021
Oh, I just don't know
if I can talk about it.

08:10.923 --> 08:12.625
It would be
our secret.

08:20.165 --> 08:21.934
Well, I just...

08:26.038 --> 08:27.105
(THINKING) <i> No.</i>

08:32.043 --> 08:34.044
<i> Mmm... No.</i>

08:37.649 --> 08:38.817
<i> Bingo!</i>

08:46.024 --> 08:47.158
Cheryl can't read.

08:56.802 --> 08:59.038
That's interesting.

08:56.802 --> 08:59.038
Hey!

08:59.071 --> 09:00.139
How was yoga class?

09:00.172 --> 09:02.173
Are you really interested,
or is it just a commercial?

09:02.206 --> 09:05.110
Oh, hold that thought.
The show's back on.

09:05.143 --> 09:07.046
So, why aren't you guys
doing homework?

09:07.078 --> 09:08.680
We finished an hour ago.

09:08.714 --> 09:10.115
TOM BERGERON ON TV: <i>
 And here's
 a golfing toddler</i>

09:10.148 --> 09:11.617
<i> who really taught dad</i>

<i> the meaning of the word

09:13.818 --> 09:15.120
(LAUGHING)

09:16.687 --> 09:18.157
Right in the crotch!

09:19.691 --> 09:21.326
Hey, you give a kid
a golf club,

09:21.360 --> 09:23.162
stand back, genius.

09:24.696 --> 09:26.764
So, Ruby, you finished
all your homework?

09:26.798 --> 09:28.067
Yeah.

09:26.798 --> 09:28.067
Every bit of it.

09:28.100 --> 09:30.002
Wow.

09:30.034 --> 09:31.269
And a lot faster
than she did with
the honors student.

09:31.302 --> 09:32.203
Oh.

09:32.238 --> 09:34.874
You might have to give up
those flash cards.

09:36.975 --> 09:38.644
Oh, look out
for the rake!

09:39.811 --> 09:41.346
ALL: Oh!

09:41.379 --> 09:43.948
Right in the crotch!

09:43.981 --> 09:46.084
All right, all right,
enough crotch stuff.

09:46.118 --> 09:47.286
Hey! Hey!

09:47.318 --> 09:48.786
Come on,
that's not cool!

09:48.820 --> 09:50.923
That ain't cool, man!
That is not cool!

09:50.956 --> 09:52.825
Bummer girl,
bummer girl.

09:52.857 --> 09:54.826
All right, girls,
go to bed.

09:54.860 --> 09:56.228
Andy, Dana, go home.

09:56.260 --> 09:57.328
(ANDY AND DANA GROAN)

09:57.361 --> 09:59.731
Oh, yeah. I forgot.

09:59.764 --> 10:00.899
Mrs. Taylor sent home
a note.

10:00.932 --> 10:02.768
Oh.

10:02.801 --> 10:04.103
She said to
give it to daddy.

10:08.840 --> 10:10.743
Oh! Uh, uh...

10:10.775 --> 10:13.745
Ruby needs to
bring a smock
for art class.

10:13.778 --> 10:14.947
What...

10:16.414 --> 10:19.651
"Please tell Ruby's mother
she needs a smock
for art class."

10:19.684 --> 10:20.852
That's what I said.

10:20.885 --> 10:23.355
Why would she send
a note for me to you?

10:23.388 --> 10:25.124
I don't know, Cheryl.

10:25.157 --> 10:27.225
It's a crazy world
out there.

10:27.259 --> 10:30.361
I once saw a dog
with a bird
riding on his back.

10:30.394 --> 10:32.163
Explain that,
and I'll explain the note.

10:33.432 --> 10:35.734
Hey, has anybody seen
my cell phone?

10:35.767 --> 10:37.036
Oh, yeah, right here.
Here it is.

10:37.068 --> 10:38.136
Oh!

10:38.169 --> 10:41.106
Oh! Right in
the crotch!

10:47.312 --> 10:48.413
Mrs. Taylor?

10:48.447 --> 10:50.349
I'm Cheryl,
Ruby's mom.

10:50.381 --> 10:53.151
Well, hi, there, mom.

10:53.184 --> 10:55.353
Yeah. We met at
back-to-school night,
remember?

10:55.386 --> 10:57.422
Of course.
You're the one

10:57.456 --> 11:00.192
who had trouble
finding the classroom.

11:00.225 --> 11:02.894
Yeah, well, those signs
can be pretty hard to
figure out.

11:02.927 --> 11:04.730
Of course they can.

11:06.331 --> 11:08.933
Well, here's the smock
you wanted for Ruby

11:08.966 --> 11:11.736
that you asked for
in the note you sent
to my husband.

11:11.769 --> 11:12.904
You know,
I was wondering,

11:12.937 --> 11:14.405
why didn't you
send the note to me?

11:14.438 --> 11:17.009
Well, I just thought
it would be

11:17.808 --> 11:19.444
easier.

11:19.477 --> 11:21.079
Well, actually, no.

11:21.113 --> 11:22.748
No, you can send
the notes to me.

11:22.780 --> 11:24.149
I promise
I'll let Jim read them.

11:24.182 --> 11:25.685
(BOTH LAUGH)

11:28.754 --> 11:30.188
Sit with me, mom.

11:30.221 --> 11:33.091
Yeah, could you not
call me mom?

11:33.125 --> 11:34.826
It's kind of
freaking me out.

11:37.895 --> 11:41.232
This is <i>
 Clara Buys A Hat.</i>

11:41.265 --> 11:42.735
Oh, please.

11:42.768 --> 11:44.370
I'd know that book
anywhere just by
the colors.

11:46.837 --> 11:49.474
Yeah, Jim reads that
to the kids every night.

11:49.508 --> 11:51.176
But you don't?

11:51.208 --> 11:53.211
No, I am thrilled
to have him
read to the kids.

11:53.245 --> 11:55.080
If that's the one thing
he does that I don't,

11:55.113 --> 11:57.883
that's fine with me.

11:57.916 --> 12:01.420
But it's not fine
when dad isn't around,
is it, mom?

12:02.953 --> 12:04.822
What?

12:04.855 --> 12:07.860
It's all right, Cheryl.
This is a safe place.

12:07.893 --> 12:09.161
I know.

12:09.193 --> 12:10.795
Know what?

12:10.828 --> 12:14.365
When dad was here
asking for less
homework for Ruby,

12:14.399 --> 12:15.735
he opened up to me.

12:16.967 --> 12:18.202
Jim was here?

12:18.235 --> 12:21.340
Yes, and he told me
you can't read.

12:25.876 --> 12:26.945
Did he?

12:36.187 --> 12:38.157
So, what time are
the other PTA moms
getting here?

12:38.190 --> 12:39.224
Any second.

12:39.256 --> 12:40.358
This is gonna be great.

12:40.392 --> 12:41.794
I know.
This is the first time

12:41.826 --> 12:43.294
the PTA has ever
sanctioned a hit.

12:44.596 --> 12:46.398
Well, it serves
Jim right,

12:46.431 --> 12:48.033
telling people
you can't read.

12:48.066 --> 12:51.503
Yeah. Read this, bucko.

12:51.535 --> 12:54.139
You know, you're
supposed to grab yourself
when you say that.

12:55.874 --> 12:57.475
Ew.

12:57.509 --> 12:59.110
I'm just saying.
Grab something.

13:02.013 --> 13:03.816
You know
what I like, Andy?

13:03.849 --> 13:05.250
What?

13:03.849 --> 13:05.250
Television.

13:05.283 --> 13:07.418
Oh, yeah. Me, too.

13:07.451 --> 13:09.955
It's like they've taken
all the interesting people
in the world

13:09.988 --> 13:11.023
and put them in a box.

13:11.056 --> 13:12.158
Yes.

13:13.390 --> 13:15.293
Hello!
Mind if we barge in?

13:15.326 --> 13:16.427
CHERYL: Hey! Come on in.

13:16.461 --> 13:17.995
We'll get started
in a minute.

13:18.028 --> 13:19.530
Cheryl, what's going on?

13:19.563 --> 13:21.466
Oh, honey, the PTA meeting
is going to be here tonight.

13:21.499 --> 13:23.402
I'm sorry.
I forgot to tell you.

13:23.434 --> 13:25.203
Make yourselves at home.
I'll be right back.

13:25.236 --> 13:26.304
PTA?

13:27.172 --> 13:29.274
Hey, Sandy, Sarah...

13:29.307 --> 13:30.442
Dixie.

13:32.910 --> 13:35.313
Oh, I wish I was
in a land of cotton.

13:38.283 --> 13:41.954
So, your husband...
Is he still in a coma?

13:44.589 --> 13:45.557
I'm divorced.

13:45.590 --> 13:48.326
Oh, yeah, that's right.
How you doing with that?

13:49.059 --> 13:50.428
It's been rough.

13:50.461 --> 13:52.029
Mmm. Yeah.

13:52.062 --> 13:53.564
Well, you're
holding up well.

13:53.597 --> 13:54.866
Mmm!

13:57.434 --> 13:59.204
It's never
going to happen.

14:01.472 --> 14:03.975
This one's sending me
mixed signals here, Jim,

14:04.009 --> 14:06.345
so I'm out of here.

14:06.378 --> 14:09.181
All right, ladies,
I'm going to
get out of your hair.

14:09.214 --> 14:11.049
But if you could,
try to wrap it up by 9:00,

14:11.081 --> 14:12.951
because that's when
the pants come off.

14:14.519 --> 14:17.154
Jim, Jim, I want
to let you know,

14:17.187 --> 14:19.924
if you need help
with anything,
just call.

14:19.957 --> 14:22.360
Yeah, sure. What would
I need help with?

14:22.394 --> 14:25.129
Mrs. Taylor told us about
Cheryl's reading problem.

14:25.163 --> 14:27.532
(GASPS)

14:27.565 --> 14:29.368
No, no, no, no, no, no.
That... That...

14:29.400 --> 14:30.935
That's not a problem.

14:30.969 --> 14:33.906
Oh, Jim, ignoring it
is not the answer.

14:33.938 --> 14:35.908
We need to bring it out
in the open.

14:35.941 --> 14:39.211
That is the worst thing
you can do with a problem!

14:39.244 --> 14:41.245
You need to sit on it
and forget about it

14:41.278 --> 14:42.947
till it fixes itself.

14:42.980 --> 14:44.515
All right,
let's get going.

14:44.548 --> 14:46.550
Uh...

14:46.583 --> 14:48.519
Cheryl, do you mind
if I join you?

14:48.552 --> 14:49.620
Really?

14:49.653 --> 14:51.289
Yeah, I mean,
I'm a P.

14:51.322 --> 14:53.192
Here's the TA.
We're together now.

14:59.364 --> 15:01.199
Okay, let's get started.

15:01.231 --> 15:02.433
Here are the agendas.

15:02.466 --> 15:06.004
Jim, you may want to
hold Cheryl's for her.

15:06.037 --> 15:07.639
I can hold
my own agenda.

15:07.672 --> 15:10.108
Oh, sure you can, sweetie.

15:10.140 --> 15:11.509
(CHUCKLES)

15:11.543 --> 15:15.514
You got that upside down,
baby. There you go.

15:15.547 --> 15:19.017
Okay, what do you say
we whip through this meeting
really quick, all right?

15:19.049 --> 15:20.117
Uh, let's see.

15:20.150 --> 15:22.353
First item here is
a bake sale.

15:22.386 --> 15:24.722
Okay, signs,
setup, and snacks.

15:24.755 --> 15:26.457
I'm thinking...

15:26.490 --> 15:27.960
Uh, you, you, and you.

15:27.993 --> 15:29.394
Okay, what's next?

15:27.993 --> 15:29.394
Hey!

15:29.427 --> 15:30.596
I want to do
the signs.

15:31.996 --> 15:33.298
Is that
such a good idea?

15:34.365 --> 15:36.067
Of course. Why?

15:36.100 --> 15:37.668
Cheryl,
because you can't!

15:37.701 --> 15:39.004
What?

15:39.037 --> 15:40.238
Well, you got all these
commitments,

15:40.270 --> 15:41.572
and you're too busy.
You're really too busy.

15:41.605 --> 15:43.241
Well, maybe you
could make the signs.

15:47.011 --> 15:48.379
Fine, I'll do them.

15:48.413 --> 15:50.716
Jim, we need 200 signs
by Monday.

15:50.749 --> 15:52.250
Are you sure?

15:52.283 --> 15:53.552
It takes a village, Cheryl.

15:55.519 --> 15:57.521
Okay, next up,
library committee.

15:57.554 --> 15:59.524
Me!

15:59.557 --> 16:02.226
Oh, Cheryl, I'm not sure
that's really the right job
for you.

16:02.259 --> 16:03.327
Why not?

16:03.360 --> 16:04.428
Well...

16:04.461 --> 16:06.197
(STAMMERING) Because...
Because, uh...

16:06.230 --> 16:08.265
Because someone
has taken it
already, honey.

16:08.298 --> 16:09.333
Who?

16:09.366 --> 16:11.336
Um... Me!

16:13.171 --> 16:14.706
Terrific. We meet
every Monday night

16:14.739 --> 16:16.307
at the library
from 8:00 to 10:00.

16:16.341 --> 16:18.677
Monday night? But that's
Monday night football!

16:20.211 --> 16:23.782
Okay, what do you say
we meet at a sports bar?

16:23.815 --> 16:25.450
Everybody know
where Cleavages is?

16:25.482 --> 16:26.985
Show a hand.

16:28.385 --> 16:30.788
Jim, Jim, come on.
It's fine. I'll do it.

16:30.822 --> 16:34.458
No, Cheryl, you can't!
I'll handle this.

16:34.491 --> 16:36.260
Okay, well...

16:34.491 --> 16:36.260
I'll do it!

16:36.293 --> 16:37.428
Can I get
everybody drinks,

16:37.461 --> 16:38.596
or do you want to
do that, too?

16:38.629 --> 16:40.131
That'd be great.
Get drinks.

16:38.629 --> 16:40.131
Okay.

16:40.164 --> 16:41.399
That's great.
Thank you, honey.

16:41.432 --> 16:43.235
Okay, so, Jim,
we've got you down

16:43.268 --> 16:45.403
for the bake sale
and the library committee.

16:45.437 --> 16:46.671
Okay.

16:45.437 --> 16:46.671
Okay, now,

16:46.703 --> 16:48.373
let's talk about
the holiday pageant.

16:49.407 --> 16:50.542
Santa.

16:51.076 --> 16:52.344
(SIGHS)

16:52.378 --> 16:55.514
Uh, Cheryl, you want
to grab me a six-pack
while you're in there?

16:56.280 --> 16:57.382
Maybe two?

16:58.383 --> 16:59.651
So, how's it going?

16:59.683 --> 17:01.819
Like a charm.
It couldn't be better.

17:01.852 --> 17:04.121
Jim is going to be
mother of the year.

17:04.154 --> 17:06.490
Oh, wait!
I've got a great idea.

17:06.522 --> 17:07.758
How about I run
out there and I say,

17:07.790 --> 17:09.827
"Cheryl, you put cleanser
in the cake mix!

17:09.861 --> 17:11.563
"Can't you read?"

17:13.464 --> 17:14.698
Yeah. Yeah.

17:14.731 --> 17:16.835
That's terrible.

17:16.867 --> 17:19.336
Jim, I have to tell you,
I'm a little uncomfortable

17:19.368 --> 17:20.671
with Cheryl
carpooling our kids.

17:20.704 --> 17:22.307
I mean, she can't read
road signs.

17:23.708 --> 17:25.477
What if a bridge
washes out?

17:25.509 --> 17:28.180
How would she know?

17:28.212 --> 17:31.383
I don't recall a bridge
between here and school.

17:31.415 --> 17:33.085
I mean, there's
a railroad crossing.

17:33.117 --> 17:34.153
(ALL GASPING)

17:35.452 --> 17:36.654
Then you have to
do it.

17:36.688 --> 17:37.689
You just have to
pick up the kids

17:37.721 --> 17:39.156
at 7:00
all next week.

17:39.190 --> 17:41.660
And no quick turns.
My Justin gets carsick.

17:41.692 --> 17:43.295
Mine, too.
If you don't...

17:43.327 --> 17:44.730
No, no, no!
Will you hens pipe down?

17:46.196 --> 17:47.832
Listen, maybe I didn't
make myself clear

17:47.865 --> 17:50.367
when I said
Cheryl couldn't read.

17:50.401 --> 17:53.171
I meant to say
she can read.

17:53.203 --> 17:55.139
Jim, don't be
an enabler.

17:55.173 --> 17:58.609
I... I am not an enabler!
She can read. I know it.

17:58.643 --> 18:00.812
Okay, so get her to read
one of these agendas.

18:00.845 --> 18:02.146
I can... I'll...

18:02.180 --> 18:03.682
Hey.

18:02.180 --> 18:03.682
Hi.

18:03.714 --> 18:04.816
So, what'd I miss?

18:04.848 --> 18:06.317
Oh, nothing.

18:06.351 --> 18:08.453
We'd like you to, um,
read this agenda.

18:08.486 --> 18:10.388
Here you go.

18:08.486 --> 18:10.388
There you go.

18:10.421 --> 18:13.158
Well, usually we just
read these to ourselves.

18:13.191 --> 18:14.893
Yeah, well, well,
I'm the chairman

18:14.925 --> 18:17.729
of the library committee,
and I'm in charge,

18:17.761 --> 18:19.464
and now you read.

18:21.766 --> 18:23.802
(STAMMERING)
I can't read this.

18:23.835 --> 18:25.269
Why not?

18:25.303 --> 18:27.372
I... I don't have
my contacts in.

18:27.404 --> 18:28.706
You don't wear contacts!

18:28.740 --> 18:31.343
Well, maybe I need them!

18:28.740 --> 18:31.343
What?

18:31.375 --> 18:33.545
Stop! This is
so painful!

18:33.577 --> 18:36.847
No, no, she can read!
Read it!

18:36.881 --> 18:38.750
These letters look weird.

18:36.881 --> 18:38.750
What?

18:41.519 --> 18:42.554
Is this even English?

18:42.586 --> 18:44.789
Of course it's English!
What are you talking about?

18:46.191 --> 18:48.492
It says here
"Never try to pull one over

18:48.526 --> 18:49.827
"on your
honors student wife."

18:49.861 --> 18:51.463
(ALL LAUGHING)

19:03.441 --> 19:06.211
You do not get
to mope-walk
up those stairs.

19:06.243 --> 19:07.778
You told Ruby's teacher
I can't read!

19:08.512 --> 19:09.747
What about you?

19:09.780 --> 19:12.216
You just pulled
a sting on me
in my own house.

19:13.351 --> 19:14.786
Well, you deserved it.

19:14.818 --> 19:16.387
You went to
Ruby's school without me

19:16.421 --> 19:18.190
and asked them
for less homework.

19:18.222 --> 19:19.758
Yes, I did.

19:19.790 --> 19:20.958
Why did you do that?

19:20.991 --> 19:22.426
Because I was
trying to help Ruby.

19:22.460 --> 19:23.694
No, no, no, Jim.

19:23.728 --> 19:24.663
You were trying
to help yourself,

19:24.695 --> 19:26.230
because you didn't want
to admit that you had

19:26.263 --> 19:27.932
just as much trouble
teaching Ruby as I did.

19:27.965 --> 19:29.700
Why would I want
to admit that?

19:29.733 --> 19:32.971
You're always saying,
"Jim, leave the kids'
education to me."

19:33.003 --> 19:34.438
You just kind of
push me aside

19:34.471 --> 19:35.574
like I'm not
smart enough.

19:35.606 --> 19:36.907
Oh, hey,
I never said that.

19:36.941 --> 19:38.710
No, no, no, no.
But you think it.

19:38.742 --> 19:40.611
Why don't you just say it?

19:38.742 --> 19:40.611
No!

19:40.644 --> 19:42.346
I want to give you
a freebie here.

19:42.380 --> 19:43.782
(SIGHS)

19:42.380 --> 19:43.782
Really. Just say it.

19:43.815 --> 19:45.817
Say, "Jim,
I'm smarter than you."

19:45.849 --> 19:47.551
No!

19:45.849 --> 19:47.551
Go on, say it.

19:47.585 --> 19:49.754
Fine!
I'm smarter than you!

19:49.787 --> 19:50.889
How dare you?

19:52.557 --> 19:53.791
You told me
to say it!

19:53.825 --> 19:56.295
I know, but I didn't think
you'd be so convincing.

19:57.795 --> 19:59.364
Daddy?

19:57.795 --> 19:59.364
Yes, honey?

19:59.396 --> 20:01.499
Come downstairs.
I want to do
math with you.

20:01.531 --> 20:02.701
What...

20:02.733 --> 20:04.468
You want to do math?

20:04.501 --> 20:05.836
Yeah. It's fun
when Daddy does it.

20:07.438 --> 20:09.508
Oh, thank you, baby.

20:12.710 --> 20:14.947
Go downstairs and get
Daddy's math candy out.

20:20.751 --> 20:22.354
See?

20:22.386 --> 20:23.520
This is what
I'm trying to tell you.

20:23.554 --> 20:25.423
We're not all
flash card people.

20:25.455 --> 20:28.459
Some of us are
marshmallow-in-the-mouth
people.

20:30.662 --> 20:32.430
You know,

20:32.462 --> 20:34.832
it's a well-known fact
that flash card people

20:34.865 --> 20:36.768
are sexier than
marshmallow people.

20:40.538 --> 20:41.740
You got that right.

20:44.308 --> 20:45.344
Oh, honey.

20:45.609 --> 20:46.644
Oh.

20:46.678 --> 20:48.813
Well, is there any room

20:48.846 --> 20:50.714
for a hoity-toity
honors student

20:50.748 --> 20:52.549
to help with
the homework?

20:52.583 --> 20:54.986
Cheryl, you said toity.

20:55.019 --> 20:56.255
(LAUGHS)

20:58.355 --> 21:00.424
Seriously, honey,
I really do want
to help,

21:00.458 --> 21:02.460
but if I can't use
my flash cards,

21:02.492 --> 21:03.727
what do I do?

21:03.760 --> 21:06.865
Well, give me a beat.

21:06.897 --> 21:08.432
What?

21:06.897 --> 21:08.432
Give me a beat.

21:08.900 --> 21:10.435
Oh.

21:10.468 --> 21:11.769
(VOCALIZING)

21:16.773 --> 21:18.609
How many marshmallows
can you fit in your mouth?

21:18.643 --> 21:20.545
Oh, that's funny.

21:20.577 --> 21:21.945
You know,
you're going to
want to bring

21:21.979 --> 21:23.914
that sense of humor
to your library
committee meeting.

21:23.948 --> 21:25.717
Great. I'll meet you
at Cleavages.
