WEBVTT

00:16.317 --> 00:18.052
Do I even need to ask?

00:18.086 --> 00:19.620
( men groaning )

00:22.456 --> 00:23.624
It's not what it looks like.

00:23.657 --> 00:24.825
MICHAEL: Your brother hustling
us?

00:24.858 --> 00:26.294
I've only played once before.

00:27.428 --> 00:29.230
I actually have
a one in eight chance

00:29.263 --> 00:31.565
of hitting a set
when I'm holding a pocket pair.

00:31.599 --> 00:33.834
I'm about 50/50 to draw a flush

00:33.867 --> 00:35.703
with three suited cards
in my hand, two off the draw.

00:35.736 --> 00:36.704
I also count my outs.

00:36.737 --> 00:38.406
I-I multiply by two.
I add one.

00:38.439 --> 00:40.074
That's roughly my percentage
of hitting.

00:41.442 --> 00:43.111
I'll be asking you soon
to take my seat.

00:43.144 --> 00:44.245
Your son is killing us, okay?

00:44.278 --> 00:45.513
ALAN:
No, not me.

00:45.546 --> 00:46.714
The only other time
Charlie played,

00:46.747 --> 00:48.382
I learned my lesson
about gambling

00:48.416 --> 00:49.250
with a mathematician.

00:49.283 --> 00:50.718
Weren't we playing
with bottle caps?

00:50.751 --> 00:52.586
Yeah... or else
you'd have walked away

00:52.620 --> 00:54.722
with the pink slip
to my car.

00:54.755 --> 00:56.590
You know, there is some element
of chance here.

00:56.624 --> 00:58.459
You know, I-I-I may
just be getting lucky.

00:58.492 --> 00:59.427
That's funny, Sinclair.
Keep that up.

00:59.460 --> 01:01.562
It comes back to me
when baseball starts.

01:01.595 --> 01:02.763
CHARLIE:
Baseball?

01:02.796 --> 01:03.831
The FBI have a team?

01:03.864 --> 01:05.266
Yeah, we got
a whole league.

01:05.299 --> 01:07.201
There's, uh, LAPD,
Sheriffs' Department...

01:07.235 --> 01:08.602
D.A.'s got the killer squad.

01:08.636 --> 01:09.770
Now that Kraft's in San Diego,

01:09.803 --> 01:11.305
you guys don't have
a power hitter.

01:11.339 --> 01:11.839
What about Don?

01:11.872 --> 01:13.707
It's not my thing.

01:13.741 --> 01:14.742
Oh, you play?

01:14.775 --> 01:16.710
Don went to college
on a baseball scholarship.

01:16.744 --> 01:17.578
What are you talking about--
you played pro

01:17.611 --> 01:18.446
second base.

01:18.479 --> 01:19.713
Single "A"
about a million years ago.

01:19.747 --> 01:20.348
MICHAEL:
That's great.

01:20.381 --> 01:22.250
You're this year's ringer.

01:22.283 --> 01:23.784
No. I'm sorry.
Not interested, buddy.

01:23.817 --> 01:25.619
- Come on, you gotta do it.
- Come on.

01:25.653 --> 01:27.755
( phone rings )
Excuse me.

01:27.788 --> 01:29.290
Eppes.

01:29.323 --> 01:30.758
We'll be right there.

01:30.791 --> 01:33.627
OFFICER: And then
what did you do, miss?

01:33.661 --> 01:35.463
I tried the door,

01:35.496 --> 01:37.231
but he didn't
answer...

01:37.265 --> 01:38.199
- Mm-hmm.
- ...so I went in.

01:38.232 --> 01:40.468
Did you see anybody?
Did you hear anything?

01:40.501 --> 01:41.802
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:41.835 --> 01:44.472
- Victim's girlfriend.
- Mm-hmm.

01:44.505 --> 01:47.475
Coroner put time of death
around 8:00 this morning.

01:47.508 --> 01:50.144
Victim's name is
Trevor Riley, 27.

01:50.178 --> 01:52.780
Wanted on a federal warrant
for stock fraud.

01:52.813 --> 01:54.782
What'd he die of?

01:54.815 --> 01:57.485
The same way as a victim
from a previous case--

01:57.518 --> 01:59.153
one you closed
a year ago.

01:59.187 --> 02:00.754
What?!

02:03.191 --> 02:04.792
He was definitely garroted.

02:04.825 --> 02:06.660
Head's nearly severed.

02:06.694 --> 02:08.496
Same as the Lisa Bayle murder.

02:08.529 --> 02:09.730
Check his back.

02:15.536 --> 02:17.505
Yep.

02:17.538 --> 02:20.608
Looks like a knee could've been
pressed in here for leverage.

02:20.641 --> 02:22.810
Also like the Bayle case.
And this.

02:22.843 --> 02:25.613
DAVID: Looks like the wire he
used to kill him

02:25.646 --> 02:26.947
he wrapped
around his work gloves here.

02:26.980 --> 02:29.517
TECH: Maybe we can get some DNA
out of these?

02:29.550 --> 02:32.753
He wore latex gloves
underneath 'em.

02:36.390 --> 02:38.192
I mean, Cliff Howard confessed
to the crime.

02:38.226 --> 02:40.194
We have his fingerprint
on Lisa Bayle's body.

02:40.228 --> 02:41.695
An eyewitness put him
at the scene.

02:41.729 --> 02:43.864
Could be a copycat-- someone who
read about the Bayle case.

02:43.897 --> 02:45.699
No. We never released
the detail

02:45.733 --> 02:47.768
about the gloves
to the press.

02:49.570 --> 02:52.806
Did I actually put
the wrong guy in jail?

02:56.610 --> 02:57.945
CHARLIE:
We all use math every day...

02:57.978 --> 03:00.814
every day...
to predict weather...

03:00.848 --> 03:03.984
to tell time...

03:04.017 --> 03:06.987
to handle money...

03:07.020 --> 03:11.292
Math is more than formulas and
equations.

03:11.325 --> 03:13.961
It's logic.

03:13.994 --> 03:16.564
It's rationality.

03:16.597 --> 03:20.668
It's using your mind to solve
the biggest mysteries we know.

03:35.949 --> 03:38.986
We've got two victims. Same m.o.

03:39.019 --> 03:40.721
One case is
a year and a half old,

03:40.754 --> 03:42.290
the other is brand-new.

03:43.924 --> 03:45.859
So, Riley here
fancies himself

03:45.893 --> 03:47.361
an investment
advisor,

03:47.395 --> 03:49.563
yet he's convicted
of fraud,

03:49.597 --> 03:51.365
arrested twice
for blackmail.

03:51.399 --> 03:53.033
He's got spreadsheets
on his computer.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.902
We'll need a forensic accountant
to untangle them.

03:56.470 --> 03:58.038
What kind of blackmail
was he into?

03:58.071 --> 03:58.939
Check it out.

03:58.972 --> 04:00.140
He-He would sleep
with married women,

04:00.173 --> 04:01.742
threaten to tell the husband
if they didn't pay him off.

04:01.775 --> 04:03.010
Classy.

04:03.043 --> 04:05.913
Yeah. Nice guy.

04:05.946 --> 04:07.415
It was a solid job, Don.

04:07.448 --> 04:10.017
Fingerprint, eyewitness,
confession.

04:10.050 --> 04:12.720
She was found in her car,
although I'm pretty darn sure

04:12.753 --> 04:14.555
she was killed someplace else.

04:14.588 --> 04:17.057
He was definitely killed
in his apartment.

04:17.090 --> 04:18.692
I mean, other
than that,

04:18.726 --> 04:21.329
every detail matches up
perfectly.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.736
Hello? Anybody home?

04:28.769 --> 04:30.003
ALAN: Yeah, Donny, I'm here.

04:30.037 --> 04:30.838
Hey, Dad, where's Charlie?

04:30.871 --> 04:33.574
Oh, I was just
talking to Charlie.

04:33.607 --> 04:35.909
He said your FBI team
needs another hitter.

04:35.943 --> 04:37.545
Why aren't you playing
baseball with them?

04:37.578 --> 04:39.480
Because I don't have time
for that.

04:39.513 --> 04:40.481
Hey, Charlie.

04:40.514 --> 04:41.281
You should play.

04:41.315 --> 04:42.282
I mean, there's no reason
to waste

04:42.316 --> 04:43.484
that experience--
they need a power hitter.

04:43.517 --> 04:45.819
- Look, you got a minute?
- That's what I was getting at.

04:45.853 --> 04:47.555
- All right, thanks.
- Actually, I got

04:47.588 --> 04:48.356
a seminar in
about a half hour.

04:48.389 --> 04:49.457
Just give me a minute,
all right?

04:49.490 --> 04:51.925
This is a copy of a file we
pulled off a computer

04:51.959 --> 04:53.060
that we think shows
some kind of fraud.

04:53.093 --> 04:55.596
The problem is our accountants
are up to their necks

04:55.629 --> 04:56.797
in this big
racketeering case;

04:56.830 --> 04:57.731
they're not going

04:57.765 --> 04:58.799
to be able to get
to it till next week.

04:58.832 --> 05:00.934
Well, love to help,
but I'm preparing a seminar

05:00.968 --> 05:03.471
on zeros of random
orthogonal polynomials.

05:03.504 --> 05:05.439
This really isn't
an advanced application.

05:05.473 --> 05:07.107
Look, please, just do
me a favor, all right?

05:07.140 --> 05:08.609
15 months ago,
I closed a case:

05:08.642 --> 05:09.777
the murder of
a young mother.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.111
Now, the guy's in
jail, but the owner

05:11.144 --> 05:12.780
of the computer we're
talking about here

05:12.813 --> 05:14.448
was just killed in
the exact same way.

05:14.482 --> 05:17.050
You suspect the two
are related.

05:17.084 --> 05:18.786
Well, that's what I'm
trying to determine.

05:18.819 --> 05:22.656
All right, all right,
I'll check it out.

05:22.690 --> 05:23.624
Thank you.

05:27.628 --> 05:31.765
So, what... you think you made
a mistake on your old case?

05:31.799 --> 05:33.467
No.

05:33.501 --> 05:35.803
I mean, we had solid evidence,

05:35.836 --> 05:40.541
but the similarity
between the cases is just...

05:40.574 --> 05:41.809
it's too glaring.

05:41.842 --> 05:44.545
Well, uh...
who's the guy that's in jail?

05:45.679 --> 05:46.814
Cliff Howard.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.816
He had a record
for robbery, carjacking.

05:48.849 --> 05:51.385
I mean, he lived blocks
from where we found the victim.

05:51.419 --> 05:53.153
Well, a jury thought they had
the right guy, didn't they?

05:53.186 --> 05:55.155
No. Never went to trial.

05:55.188 --> 05:57.491
Pleaded guilty
to avoid a life sentence.

05:57.525 --> 05:59.092
( sighs )

06:02.696 --> 06:04.498
As I was removing
Trevor Riley's body,

06:04.532 --> 06:05.833
I noticed the
facing was loose,

06:05.866 --> 06:07.568
and when I
pulled it off...

06:07.601 --> 06:09.570
Must be what,
several thousand?

06:09.603 --> 06:11.472
AGENT:
Sir...

06:11.505 --> 06:13.106
we got some more over here.

06:28.622 --> 06:30.658
Here's the last of it.

06:30.691 --> 06:32.860
About $525,000.

06:32.893 --> 06:35.195
Yeah. No way he could explain
all this to a bank.

06:35.228 --> 06:37.030
- Mm-mm.
- No mail in the box,

06:37.064 --> 06:39.700
phone's turned off, and all of
his furniture's rented.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.702
Whatever his scam was,
he was getting ready to move on.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.704
DON: Yep.
( opera music playing nearby)

06:43.737 --> 06:45.138
Neighbor.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.742
Let's go check him out.

06:48.776 --> 06:50.644
( turns volume down )

06:52.680 --> 06:56.183
I was at the opera last night
when they found the body.

06:56.216 --> 06:58.452
TERRY: We think he was killed
yesterday morning

06:58.486 --> 07:00.153
at about 8:00 a.m.
Were you home?

07:00.187 --> 07:03.557
I was getting ready
for school.

07:03.591 --> 07:05.493
I heard him having
an argument.

07:05.526 --> 07:06.827
I had my music on loud,

07:06.860 --> 07:08.161
but they were louder.

07:08.195 --> 07:09.229
"They"?

07:09.262 --> 07:10.230
Yeah.

07:10.263 --> 07:11.331
The electrician.

07:11.364 --> 07:13.166
Would you recognize the man
if you saw him again?

07:13.200 --> 07:17.004
Yeah, he's Hispanic.

07:17.037 --> 07:18.706
Bald...

07:18.739 --> 07:20.874
His van says
"The Electrician Connection."

07:21.975 --> 07:23.143
So, you're a teacher?

07:23.176 --> 07:24.177
Yes.

07:24.211 --> 07:25.646
I teach music at Westmore.

07:25.679 --> 07:26.580
Did you ever do any business

07:26.614 --> 07:27.781
or have any financial dealings
with him?

07:27.815 --> 07:29.750
No. I understand he was

07:29.783 --> 07:32.152
some kind
of investment counselor?

07:32.185 --> 07:34.955
Uh... I didn't have
any need for that.

07:34.988 --> 07:36.590
Teacher's salary,
you understand?

07:40.728 --> 07:41.629
DAVID:
Were you ever

07:41.662 --> 07:43.597
at Trevor Riley's
apartment, Mr. Salazar?

07:43.631 --> 07:46.266
SALAZAR: Yeah, I was at
Trevor Riley's place.

07:46.299 --> 07:47.267
To fix the lights.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.502
Yesterday morning?

07:48.536 --> 07:50.604
Two months ago.

07:50.638 --> 07:52.673
Did you do any other work
for Mr. Riley?

07:52.706 --> 07:55.042
Why? What's going on?

07:55.075 --> 07:56.644
Any other work,
Mr. Salazar?

08:00.981 --> 08:03.984
I ran some grounded outlets
for his computers.

08:04.017 --> 08:05.853
Your company doesn't have
a record of that.

08:07.154 --> 08:09.790
My boss finds out,
I'm fired, okay?

08:09.823 --> 08:10.824
I've got three kids.

08:10.858 --> 08:12.660
I got to take work
off the books.

08:12.693 --> 08:14.728
I went there before work,
never on the clock.

08:14.762 --> 08:18.131
When did you install
the outlets?

08:18.165 --> 08:19.132
I made three visits.

08:19.166 --> 08:20.634
The last one was a week ago.

08:20.668 --> 08:21.969
How is this an FBI...

08:22.002 --> 08:23.637
Did you ever have any
disagreements with Riley,

08:23.671 --> 08:25.305
at all,
at any time?

08:25.338 --> 08:28.842
When I was finished...

08:28.876 --> 08:30.277
he tried to underpay me.

08:30.310 --> 08:31.211
We worked it out.

08:31.244 --> 08:32.646
And you weren't there
yesterday morning?

08:32.680 --> 08:36.249
I was at the batting cages.

08:36.283 --> 08:39.720
I'm there every Tuesday
and Thursday.

08:39.753 --> 08:42.790
Members can come and go
whenever.

08:42.823 --> 08:43.991
They don't have
to sign in?

08:44.024 --> 08:46.226
No, they get a combination.

08:46.259 --> 08:47.761
They can punch it in
anytime

08:47.795 --> 08:49.096
between 6:00 a.m.
and 11:00 p.m.

08:49.129 --> 08:50.798
Midnight on weekends.

08:50.831 --> 08:53.801
How about a security cam?
Any way I can

08:53.834 --> 08:54.768
get a look at a tape?

08:54.802 --> 08:56.804
It got busted. Foul ball.

08:56.837 --> 08:59.006
TERRY: So Salazar has a fight
with the victim,

08:59.039 --> 09:00.674
and his alibi doesn't hold up.

09:00.708 --> 09:02.843
I mean, you got to figure
an electrician's gonna have

09:02.876 --> 09:05.579
the fine-gauge wire
used in both killings, right?

09:05.613 --> 09:06.847
Yeah.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.582
Maybe he did some work
at Lisa Bayle's house.

09:08.616 --> 09:11.819
You're thinking if we can prove
Salazar killed Trevor Riley,

09:11.852 --> 09:14.221
then we find a link between
Salazar and Bayle...

09:14.254 --> 09:15.789
I'm thinking we should
be focusing

09:15.823 --> 09:16.990
on what got Riley killed.

09:17.024 --> 09:18.158
( bat hitting ball )

09:21.862 --> 09:24.331
Riley was running
a fraud...

09:24.364 --> 09:25.966
a classic pyramid scheme.

09:25.999 --> 09:28.869
DON: Why don't you tell us what
you know?

09:28.902 --> 09:30.838
He sent e-mails to investors
at Smith-Waterson

09:30.871 --> 09:32.706
that looked like
official communication.

09:32.740 --> 09:34.207
It's called "spoofing."

09:34.241 --> 09:36.844
Those e-mails
claimed that

09:36.877 --> 09:39.713
he was connected to
Smith-Waterson; asked investors

09:39.747 --> 09:40.614
to send him information:

09:40.648 --> 09:42.015
user I.D.'s, security codes
and such--

09:42.049 --> 09:43.751
so he could get
into their accounts.

09:43.784 --> 09:47.888
Now, why didn't people
complain about missing money?

09:47.921 --> 09:49.222
Mr. Riley was a very,
very smart man.

09:49.256 --> 09:50.791
Instead of pulling out
lump sums,

09:50.824 --> 09:52.025
which might draw
immediate notice,

09:52.059 --> 09:54.027
he had a scheme
to drain out of

09:54.061 --> 09:56.730
large sums
without raising an alarm.

09:57.765 --> 09:59.332
He started by taking

09:59.366 --> 10:01.769
two dollars out
of each account...

10:01.802 --> 10:04.004
then he'd replace the money
within a few days

10:04.037 --> 10:06.373
by taking two more dollars
out of two more accounts.

10:06.406 --> 10:08.041
So he'd put two bucks back,

10:08.075 --> 10:10.143
and keep the other two
for himself.

10:10.177 --> 10:12.846
He recorded them
as accounting errors

10:12.880 --> 10:15.916
with amounts so small,
no one double-checked.

10:15.949 --> 10:17.885
Okay, so how does two dollars
become half a million?

10:17.918 --> 10:20.854
Okay... uh...
good question.

10:20.888 --> 10:21.822
And...

10:27.895 --> 10:29.797
I've folded this paper twice.

10:29.830 --> 10:31.932
It is now four times as thick
as it was.

10:31.965 --> 10:34.267
If I could potentially fold it
50 times,

10:34.301 --> 10:35.736
how tall do you think

10:35.769 --> 10:37.971
the resulting stack of paper
would be?

10:38.005 --> 10:39.940
Well, I mean, it's got to be
at least a couple feet.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.041
No, no, I'd say
more like a building.

10:41.074 --> 10:42.843
Tall enough to reach the sun.

10:42.876 --> 10:43.944
Wow.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.145
It's a geometric progression.

10:45.178 --> 10:47.881
I mean, obviously, you cannot
fold this paper 50 times.

10:47.915 --> 10:49.817
A high school student
named Britney Gallivan

10:49.850 --> 10:51.084
predicted a way to do it
12 times

10:51.118 --> 10:52.119
and then she did it
with actual paper.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.220
She set a world record.

10:53.253 --> 10:54.454
How tall was it?

10:54.487 --> 10:56.423
Oh... a foot and a half.

10:57.991 --> 11:00.260
The same principal applies
to embezzlement.

11:00.293 --> 11:03.697
However, it takes twice
as many accounts at each level.

11:03.731 --> 11:08.235
It's a pyramid scheme...
you know, it can't last, but...

11:08.268 --> 11:10.470
by the 19th progression,

11:10.503 --> 11:14.908
Riley had siphoned off
$524,288...

11:14.942 --> 11:17.210
Right, 'cause he'd always
need twice as much

11:17.244 --> 11:18.879
to replace
what he'd taken.

11:18.912 --> 11:22.015
You run out of resources--
the pyramid collapses.

11:22.049 --> 11:25.919
And, by the time
it all crashes down,

11:25.953 --> 11:28.121
Riley's long gone.

11:28.155 --> 11:30.457
DON: So you're saying he made
solicitations

11:30.490 --> 11:32.125
to Smith-Waterson's
investors.

11:32.159 --> 11:33.961
I'd like to know how
he got that list.

11:33.994 --> 11:35.362
That shouldn't be
too hard to figure out.

11:35.395 --> 11:37.430
Let me see
what I can do.

11:37.464 --> 11:38.999
The Lisa Bayle
murder case--

11:39.032 --> 11:40.433
I need you to look
at the evidence

11:40.467 --> 11:42.903
and just see if there's
something I'm missing.

11:42.936 --> 11:44.905
I have no idea how to evaluate
forensic evidence.

11:44.938 --> 11:47.174
Well, it's just logic, Charlie.
You're trained in that.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.209
You know how to spot
inconsistencies, right?

11:49.242 --> 11:51.011
I mean, it's like
when a mathematician

11:51.044 --> 11:52.179
makes a breakthrough.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.781
He gets his peers...
Right.

11:53.814 --> 11:55.282
Peer review
to check his findings.

11:55.315 --> 11:56.483
It's what we do.

11:56.516 --> 11:59.386
Well, just do me a favor and
see if I made any mistakes.

11:59.419 --> 12:01.154
What incriminating
evidence was there?

12:01.188 --> 12:02.856
First of all, we
got a confession,

12:02.890 --> 12:05.025
we got a fingerprint,
we got an eyewitness account.

12:05.058 --> 12:06.493
I'll try to understand the
methodology

12:06.526 --> 12:07.227
behind each of those.

12:07.260 --> 12:09.797
- Great. Thanks.
- No problem.

12:09.830 --> 12:12.432
I got a line on how Riley got
Smith-Waterson's mailing list.

12:12.465 --> 12:14.501
His girlfriend, Mikelle Peters,
works there.

12:14.534 --> 12:16.804
You gave Trevor a list
of your company's client

12:16.837 --> 12:18.972
e-mail addresses.

12:19.006 --> 12:20.974
He said no one would notice.

12:21.008 --> 12:22.876
Damn him.

12:22.910 --> 12:24.945
He said if I didn't
give him that list,

12:24.978 --> 12:26.446
he'd tell them about me.

12:26.479 --> 12:28.215
So you were blackmailed?

12:30.050 --> 12:32.786
Listen, you understand
what you're facing here?

12:32.820 --> 12:35.889
You're an accessory to fraud.
That's just for starters.

12:35.923 --> 12:40.527
He found out--
God knows how--

12:40.560 --> 12:43.897
that I didn't graduate
from college.

12:43.931 --> 12:46.066
I lied on my resume
to get this job.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.935
He threatens to expose you,
you kept dating him?

12:47.968 --> 12:50.470
He had money,

12:50.503 --> 12:52.005
spent lots of it on me.

12:52.039 --> 12:53.073
You know someone

12:53.106 --> 12:54.942
named Jose Salazar?

12:54.975 --> 12:55.943
Who?

12:55.976 --> 12:58.111
Jose Salazar.

12:58.145 --> 13:01.314
Oh, yeah, the electrician.

13:01.348 --> 13:03.283
I think Trevor scammed him
or something.

13:05.953 --> 13:08.521
Just tell me if you recognize
any of them,

13:08.555 --> 13:10.924
but take your time.

13:19.066 --> 13:20.868
What do you think?

13:20.901 --> 13:22.435
The second from the left.

13:22.469 --> 13:23.470
Can you point to him?

13:23.503 --> 13:24.972
Number two.

13:25.005 --> 13:26.006
Okay, I need you to sign it

13:26.039 --> 13:27.607
to show that this is the man
you're identifying

13:27.640 --> 13:29.276
as the one you saw in
Trevor Riley's apartment

13:29.309 --> 13:31.244
on the morning
he was killed.

13:40.553 --> 13:43.056
Hey, Jose, got a couple
more questions for you.

13:45.625 --> 13:47.327
Aw, don't do this.

13:57.504 --> 13:59.472
- You go right.
- I'm on it!

14:32.205 --> 14:33.273
Stay down!

14:36.409 --> 14:38.011
( handcuffs latching )

14:45.118 --> 14:46.286
He said he could
add a zero.

14:46.319 --> 14:47.287
To what?

14:47.320 --> 14:49.022
To my $8,000.

14:49.056 --> 14:50.523
17 years
of savings.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.692
Then you find out he's about
to leave town with your money.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.928
No, that's what
you're telling me.

14:54.962 --> 14:56.496
I didn't know he was moving.

14:56.529 --> 14:57.965
We've got prints,

14:57.998 --> 14:58.999
we've got the right gauge wire

14:59.032 --> 15:00.100
in the back of your truck,

15:00.133 --> 15:02.035
we got an eyewitness
that makes a liar out of you.

15:02.069 --> 15:03.470
The morning that Riley died,

15:03.503 --> 15:05.138
I was at the batting cages.

15:05.172 --> 15:06.239
You can ask anyone there.

15:06.273 --> 15:07.307
We did.

15:07.340 --> 15:09.442
The manager
doesn't remember you.

15:09.476 --> 15:11.678
You know a woman
named Lisa Bayle?

15:16.549 --> 15:18.451
April 9, 2004--
where were you?

15:18.485 --> 15:21.054
In San Diego.

15:21.088 --> 15:23.390
Spent the week
on a big job--

15:23.423 --> 15:25.058
wiring apartments.

15:25.092 --> 15:28.261
And I don't know
who you're talking about.

15:28.295 --> 15:29.329
I don't know.

15:29.362 --> 15:31.231
You think he
recognized her name?

15:31.264 --> 15:33.000
Hard to say.
He reacted.

15:33.033 --> 15:34.434
And he's got motive
for killing Riley,

15:34.467 --> 15:36.069
an eyewitness put him
at the scene,

15:36.103 --> 15:38.371
he threatened the victim,
he lied about his alibi.

15:38.405 --> 15:39.439
Yeah, that's all good,

15:39.472 --> 15:41.608
but all we've got on Lisa Bayle
is a similar M.O.

15:41.641 --> 15:42.409
Could be coincidence.

15:42.442 --> 15:46.579
Yeah... I mean...
my gut says no,

15:46.613 --> 15:48.248
but I asked Charlie to
run some numbers on it.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.183
I'm going to go see
if I can track him down.

15:50.217 --> 15:52.085
Okay.

15:52.119 --> 15:54.187
So what's the possibility
that these two murders

15:54.221 --> 15:55.622
could have been done

15:55.655 --> 15:57.090
by different people?

15:57.124 --> 15:59.226
Okay... according
to the FBI's

15:59.259 --> 16:01.028
crime stats,
in the entire country,

16:01.061 --> 16:03.596
three or four people are killed
with a garrote every year.

16:03.630 --> 16:05.665
Five percent of total murders
in the United States

16:05.698 --> 16:06.766
take place in Los Angeles.

16:06.799 --> 16:07.767
So, assuming that

16:07.800 --> 16:10.670
he didn't get the idea
from the first killer,

16:10.703 --> 16:13.640
there's a 4.9% chance
that this is a coincidence.

16:13.673 --> 16:15.142
Yeah, I knew it would be slim.

16:18.078 --> 16:19.146
What are you going to do?

16:19.179 --> 16:21.181
Well, I'm going to hold
Jose Salazar for the murder

16:21.214 --> 16:22.649
of Trevor Riley,
and see if I can

16:22.682 --> 16:23.616
link him to Lisa Bayle.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.785
And if Cliff Howard's in jail
by mistake,

16:25.818 --> 16:27.754
I'm going to fix it.

16:27.787 --> 16:31.558
Why do I have to tell you
all over again?

16:31.591 --> 16:33.493
Because I need you
to tell me the truth

16:33.526 --> 16:35.195
about what happened
to Lisa Bayle.

16:35.228 --> 16:36.396
I told you.

16:36.429 --> 16:38.031
I told everyone.

16:38.065 --> 16:39.499
I killed her, and I'm sorry.

16:39.532 --> 16:43.436
Okay, please take me through it
one more time.

16:44.737 --> 16:46.573
I needed a car.

16:46.606 --> 16:49.176
She was lost,
she asked for directions.

16:49.209 --> 16:50.710
I pretended I didn't hear.

16:50.743 --> 16:51.911
She got out of the car.

16:51.944 --> 16:55.215
I came up behind her, wrapped
the wire around her neck,

16:55.248 --> 16:57.517
pushed my knee
into her back and pulled.

16:57.550 --> 17:00.320
Her feet lifted off the ground.

17:00.353 --> 17:02.389
I put her body
in the backseat.

17:02.422 --> 17:04.491
I'm sorry for what I did.

17:04.524 --> 17:08.195
When I arrested you,
you told me you didn't do it.

17:08.228 --> 17:10.397
You said you were home alone.

17:10.430 --> 17:12.099
I lied.

17:12.132 --> 17:13.700
Cliff, were you coerced
into confessing?

17:13.733 --> 17:15.735
- No.
- You're not covering

17:15.768 --> 17:16.736
for anybody?

17:16.769 --> 17:19.706
I did it. Alone.

17:19.739 --> 17:21.074
And I'm sorry.

17:21.108 --> 17:23.576
You know someone
named Jose Salazar?

17:23.610 --> 17:24.844
No.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.246
Trevor Riley?

17:26.279 --> 17:27.814
Never heard of him.

17:38.458 --> 17:41.294
Mrs. Howard, remember me,
Don Eppes, FBI?

17:41.328 --> 17:43.230
This is
Agent Sinclair.

17:43.263 --> 17:45.298
What do you want?

17:45.332 --> 17:47.634
We need to ask you
a few questions

17:47.667 --> 17:49.436
about your husband.

17:49.469 --> 17:51.138
Okay?

17:51.171 --> 17:53.206
( sighs )

17:55.908 --> 17:57.310
Cliff told you he did it

17:57.344 --> 17:59.112
and he told you
he was sorry, right?

17:59.146 --> 18:00.480
Right.

18:00.513 --> 18:01.581
And I need to know,

18:01.614 --> 18:03.283
and you gotta be
honest with me--

18:03.316 --> 18:04.851
did he ever say
that he didn't do it?

18:04.884 --> 18:09.356
Agent Eppes, Lisa Bayle
was a wealthy woman

18:09.389 --> 18:10.490
three months pregnant.

18:10.523 --> 18:13.560
We lived three blocks away
from where she was found.

18:13.593 --> 18:16.229
You had his fingerprints
and a witness saw him.

18:16.263 --> 18:17.830
You're not
answering my question.

18:19.766 --> 18:23.670
My husband took a lawyer's
advice-- he confessed.

18:23.703 --> 18:26.873
He's a model prisoner
and he expresses remorse

18:26.906 --> 18:30.777
and in 27 years he might get out
when my son is 30.

18:30.810 --> 18:32.779
DAVID: Mrs. Howard,
we're looking

18:32.812 --> 18:34.481
at your husband's
case again.

18:34.514 --> 18:35.815
We need to know if there's
anything he can add

18:35.848 --> 18:36.816
to his story.

18:36.849 --> 18:39.386
Good. Look again.

18:39.419 --> 18:40.753
But Cliff can't help you.

18:42.789 --> 18:45.625
He's sticking to his story
or risk losing his parole.

18:45.658 --> 18:46.626
Mommy?

18:46.659 --> 18:48.661
Hey, it's okay,
baby.

18:48.695 --> 18:51.864
Hey... okay,
come here.

18:51.898 --> 18:53.733
Come on.

19:00.507 --> 19:02.809
Okay. Thanks.

19:09.582 --> 19:10.550
- Hey, Charlie.
- Hey.

19:10.583 --> 19:11.551
What's up?

19:11.584 --> 19:12.519
I wanted to ask Don

19:12.552 --> 19:14.687
about the eyewitness
in the Lisa Bayle case.

19:14.721 --> 19:15.522
Yeah?

19:15.555 --> 19:16.756
Do you think
Cliff Howard's lineup

19:16.789 --> 19:19.192
was conducted in the same manner
as the one I saw yesterday--

19:19.226 --> 19:20.493
the one of the man suspected

19:20.527 --> 19:21.528
of killing Trevor Riley?

19:21.561 --> 19:23.496
Yeah, all lineups
are conducted

19:23.530 --> 19:25.765
pretty much in
the same manner, why?

19:34.974 --> 19:36.909
Pick a number, any number.

19:38.811 --> 19:40.413
Three.

19:40.447 --> 19:41.481
Pick another number.

19:41.514 --> 19:42.815
Six.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.884
- Pick one more.
- Okay, but this is the last.

19:44.917 --> 19:46.986
One.

19:47.019 --> 19:48.755
I asked you to pick
a number three times

19:48.788 --> 19:51.324
and three times you picked
a number between one and six.

19:51.358 --> 19:52.325
Why? Why'd you do that?

19:52.359 --> 19:54.494
Why didn't you pick zero,
or 3,000 or seven?

19:54.527 --> 19:55.995
Because you didn't
write those down.

19:56.028 --> 19:57.430
I didn't say pick a number

19:57.464 --> 19:58.998
that I wrote
on the paper, did I?

19:59.031 --> 20:00.267
No, I just assumed.

20:00.300 --> 20:02.235
Exactly. A witness assumes

20:02.269 --> 20:04.771
that he has to pick
one of the six people

20:04.804 --> 20:06.706
he's looking at, right?

20:06.739 --> 20:08.975
His decision is based
on that assumption.

20:09.008 --> 20:10.410
Lineups are dictated

20:10.443 --> 20:11.411
by Bureau policy.

20:11.444 --> 20:12.245
They're based on case law.

20:12.279 --> 20:13.613
It's the way
the Justice Department

20:13.646 --> 20:14.614
has run lineups for years.

20:14.647 --> 20:16.249
That doesn't make it right.

20:16.283 --> 20:17.984
How is this math?

20:18.017 --> 20:19.986
It's not math, it's logic,
really.

20:20.019 --> 20:22.355
Mathematicians are trained
in logic.

20:22.389 --> 20:23.923
All right, look,
there is another way.

20:23.956 --> 20:25.692
It's called a sequential lineup.

20:25.725 --> 20:28.561
We show photos one at a time,
and ask each time,

20:28.595 --> 20:29.429
"Is this the guy?"

20:29.462 --> 20:31.264
Studies show it reduces
false positives,

20:31.298 --> 20:32.965
but it also reduces the number
positive I.D.'s,

20:32.999 --> 20:34.534
even when the target
is present.

20:34.567 --> 20:37.537
If Cliff Howard
was identified

20:37.570 --> 20:40.773
by a witness looking at
a traditional lineup, then...

20:40.807 --> 20:42.442
well, then...

20:42.475 --> 20:45.812
that I.D. could be wrong, right?

20:48.981 --> 20:52.552
Okay, I'll talk to the witness
in the Bayle case again.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.053
Thanks.

20:54.086 --> 20:55.988
MAN:
I've never seen him before.

20:56.022 --> 20:57.757
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

20:57.790 --> 20:59.992
I mean, maybe he did some work
for you guys around here.

21:00.026 --> 21:01.794
Yeah, he could have.
I wouldn't know.

21:01.828 --> 21:02.929
Lisa was in charge
of all that.

21:02.962 --> 21:04.130
I'm just trying
to figure out

21:04.163 --> 21:07.634
if there's any possibility
that this man knew your wife.

21:07.667 --> 21:09.035
Why?

21:09.068 --> 21:10.870
You're not going to want
to hear this,

21:10.903 --> 21:13.573
but there are some questions
about Cliff Howard's conviction.

21:13.606 --> 21:15.508
The bastard said he did it.

21:15.542 --> 21:16.909
I know.

21:16.943 --> 21:18.978
I haven't seen you in a year.

21:19.011 --> 21:19.912
I haven't seen you

21:19.946 --> 21:22.982
since you interrogated me
for 48 hours.

21:23.015 --> 21:24.584
- Sir...
- I had to call the funeral home

21:24.617 --> 21:25.985
handcuffed to a table.

21:26.018 --> 21:29.088
I was pursuing your wife's
murder wherever it took me.

21:29.121 --> 21:30.990
So help me...

21:31.023 --> 21:33.025
Now you want to tear
these wounds open again.

21:33.059 --> 21:34.694
I don't want to do that.

21:42.134 --> 21:44.070
This your... your daughter.

21:44.103 --> 21:45.338
What's her name? Paula?

21:45.372 --> 21:46.473
Yes.

21:46.506 --> 21:48.040
Right. May I?

21:48.074 --> 21:50.743
Go ahead.

21:53.746 --> 21:55.047
She's a sophomore now.

22:02.389 --> 22:04.624
Jonas, don't you want
to know the truth

22:04.657 --> 22:06.125
about your wife's death?

22:06.158 --> 22:07.727
Cliff Howard is the truth.

22:15.902 --> 22:18.004
Oh, I see we're off
on yet another

22:18.037 --> 22:21.040
exciting area of criminology.

22:21.073 --> 22:22.609
Yep.

22:22.642 --> 22:24.877
Don thinks he may have
put the wrong man

22:24.911 --> 22:26.078
in jail for murder.

22:26.112 --> 22:27.079
I'm trying
to determine

22:27.113 --> 22:28.581
whether his case
holds up or not.

22:28.615 --> 22:29.949
So, what, you're analyzing

22:29.982 --> 22:31.684
modern American
criminal science?

22:31.718 --> 22:33.085
I'm working
on an application

22:33.119 --> 22:34.621
of statistical analysis

22:34.654 --> 22:37.089
as it applies
to eyewitness identification.

22:37.123 --> 22:39.692
It's clear that the six man,
side-by-side lineup

22:39.726 --> 22:40.893
is intrinsically
flawed.

22:40.927 --> 22:42.094
Yes. Yes,

22:42.128 --> 22:43.295
I can see that,

22:43.329 --> 22:46.399
but in this particular case
that you're working on here,

22:46.433 --> 22:48.100
I mean, was the wrong
man identified?

22:48.134 --> 22:49.569
CHARLIE:
We're not sure, but,

22:49.602 --> 22:50.737
uh, but under this system,

22:50.770 --> 22:53.039
it's possible that a witness
identified the wrong man.

22:53.072 --> 22:56.142
Well, yes,
it's possible, but is that

22:56.175 --> 22:58.144
what actually happened here?
I mean,

22:58.177 --> 23:01.614
have you developed a
test to determine that?

23:01.648 --> 23:03.883
No. We're studying
the methodology itself.

23:03.916 --> 23:07.119
Well, why?
Not the accuracy

23:07.153 --> 23:09.989
of the individual result?

23:12.091 --> 23:14.026
You're trying to say
that we shouldn't

23:14.060 --> 23:15.895
be debunking
the traditional method

23:15.928 --> 23:18.898
of identifying suspects
through police lineups,

23:18.931 --> 23:20.600
even though it's
seemingly unreliable?

23:20.633 --> 23:24.203
Okay, I just...

23:24.236 --> 23:25.071
Eh...

23:25.104 --> 23:26.105
LARRY:
Yeah...

23:26.138 --> 23:27.474
just...

23:27.507 --> 23:30.577
I would just consider
the implications

23:30.610 --> 23:33.112
just very carefully, you know.

23:33.145 --> 23:36.616
'Cause this is a real
murder case, isn't it?

23:36.649 --> 23:38.885
I mean, someone
has died and...

23:38.918 --> 23:40.620
Yeah... I mean,

23:40.653 --> 23:42.088
yes, you've demonstrated that

23:42.121 --> 23:46.493
the identification may be wrong.

23:46.526 --> 23:49.562
It's just that you haven't
proven it was wrong.

23:49.596 --> 23:51.631
( door closes )

23:51.664 --> 23:54.166
TERRY:
Mrs. Malloy,

23:54.200 --> 23:56.168
did he run towards you
or away from you?

23:56.202 --> 23:57.169
Away.

23:57.203 --> 23:58.505
And it was dark.

23:58.538 --> 24:00.106
Well, he looked behind.

24:00.139 --> 24:03.876
He was about six feet
tall and wearing

24:03.910 --> 24:06.646
a sweatshirt
and, uh, jeans.

24:06.679 --> 24:08.748
And this is the same man
you saw in the lineup?

24:08.781 --> 24:11.017
Well, of course he was there.

24:11.050 --> 24:12.619
I picked him out.

24:12.652 --> 24:14.253
Yes.

24:14.286 --> 24:15.888
Have you ever seen this man?

24:18.691 --> 24:20.693
That's the man I saw.

24:20.727 --> 24:22.529
Okay.

24:22.562 --> 24:24.163
Thank you.

24:24.196 --> 24:25.798
Janice Malloy
identified Salazar

24:25.832 --> 24:27.767
as Lisa Bayle's killer,
but before, she made

24:27.800 --> 24:29.135
a positive I.D.
of Cliff Howard.

24:29.168 --> 24:30.937
Doesn't inspire
confidence.

24:30.970 --> 24:33.105
She was never cross-examined,
since Howard pled out.

24:33.139 --> 24:34.040
So we have

24:34.073 --> 24:35.942
an eyewitness that
might not be reliable,

24:35.975 --> 24:37.510
and there's doubts
about the confession.

24:37.544 --> 24:39.078
The only hard evidence
against Howard

24:39.111 --> 24:40.613
is the fingerprint
on Bayle's body.

24:40.647 --> 24:42.549
Which I want to get
checked again, and again

24:42.582 --> 24:43.550
if we have to.

24:43.583 --> 24:44.551
Let's do it.

24:44.584 --> 24:46.018
( keyboarding )

24:46.052 --> 24:48.521
I'm comparing a clean set
of Cliff Howard's prints

24:48.555 --> 24:50.990
with this, taken

24:51.023 --> 24:52.191
from Lisa Bayle's body.

24:52.224 --> 24:53.526
- Right.
- 25% is visible.

24:53.560 --> 24:54.961
The rest is
obviously distorted.

24:54.994 --> 24:56.062
Okay, so there
is a chance

24:56.095 --> 24:57.263
it's not Howard's
print, right?

24:57.296 --> 24:58.297
A chance.

24:58.330 --> 25:00.032
Mm, not exactly.

25:00.066 --> 25:01.267
( keyboarding )

25:01.300 --> 25:03.202
I found seven
commonalities

25:03.235 --> 25:05.271
between the print
found on the body

25:05.304 --> 25:07.640
and the one taken
directly from Howard.

25:07.674 --> 25:09.809
Here, the same ridges form dots,

25:09.842 --> 25:12.178
and here...
the same bifurcations,

25:12.211 --> 25:13.279
and from that,

25:13.312 --> 25:14.413
I'd say that the print

25:14.446 --> 25:16.115
from the crime scene
is Cliff Howard's.

25:19.586 --> 25:22.154
Which would mean
he di kill her.

25:31.631 --> 25:33.866
CHARLIE:
How do we know that everyone

25:33.900 --> 25:35.568
has their own
unique fingerprint?

25:35.602 --> 25:37.804
Because no two people have
ever been found to have

25:37.837 --> 25:38.805
the same prints.

25:38.838 --> 25:41.841
Mm-hmm. And you've
examined everyone's print?

25:41.874 --> 25:42.842
Everyone on the planet?

25:42.875 --> 25:44.076
It's an
assumption we make,

25:44.110 --> 25:46.846
based on a hundred years
of empirical evidence.

25:46.879 --> 25:47.513
It is.

25:47.546 --> 25:49.682
How often
does one part

25:49.716 --> 25:51.884
of someone's print
resemble someone else's?

25:51.918 --> 25:53.119
I couldn't
tell you that.

25:53.152 --> 25:56.723
We've never done those kind
of, uh... population surveys.

25:56.756 --> 25:59.225
Isn't random match probability
the only way you have of knowing

25:59.258 --> 26:00.727
the likelihood
of two prints matching?

26:00.760 --> 26:01.894
Random match is used

26:01.928 --> 26:02.995
in DNA analysis.

26:03.029 --> 26:05.364
Exactly. That's why,
when experts make a DNA match,

26:05.397 --> 26:06.866
they don't say
it's a sure thing.

26:06.899 --> 26:09.802
They say there's a one-
in-four-billion chance

26:09.836 --> 26:12.071
that the DNA sample
comes from the same person.

26:12.104 --> 26:15.608
But fingerprints
don't have odds.

26:15.642 --> 26:17.744
They just match or
they don't match?

26:17.777 --> 26:20.613
Two technicians before me
also determined

26:20.647 --> 26:24.050
that this thumbprint
belongs to Cliff Howard.

26:25.317 --> 26:27.820
Why is that,
why is that a thumbprint?

26:27.854 --> 26:30.957
Why not, like a...
a left index finger?

26:30.990 --> 26:33.760
Because it has the arches,
loops and whorls of a thumb.

26:33.793 --> 26:34.761
See the center

26:34.794 --> 26:36.062
of this whorl here?

26:36.095 --> 26:37.129
It's a clock face.

26:37.163 --> 26:39.365
This is 12:00.

26:43.235 --> 26:44.303
What shape is this?

26:44.336 --> 26:45.672
A cone.

26:45.705 --> 26:47.740
Hmm. Depends on how
you look at it.

26:49.776 --> 26:52.278
See, from different angles,
it's a circle,

26:52.311 --> 26:53.913
or it's a triangle.

26:53.946 --> 26:56.115
A Penrose triangle,
which is an impossible figure.

26:56.148 --> 26:58.217
A cork plug,
which can be used

26:58.250 --> 27:00.920
as a stopper for
a round, triangular

27:00.953 --> 27:03.422
or square hole, depending

27:03.455 --> 27:05.224
on how you turn it.

27:05.257 --> 27:07.660
See, you assume that
this is a thumbprint

27:07.694 --> 27:09.295
because you approach it
as such.

27:09.328 --> 27:12.899
But is it possible
that someone else

27:12.932 --> 27:13.565
has a left
index finger...

27:13.599 --> 27:15.802
in which
a quarter-section,

27:15.835 --> 27:17.236
turned sideways,

27:17.269 --> 27:20.406
has points of commonality
with Cliff Howard's thumb?

27:20.439 --> 27:22.408
I've been doing this
job for eight years.

27:22.441 --> 27:24.343
Are you better at it now
than you were

27:24.376 --> 27:25.945
- eight years ago?
- Of course.

27:25.978 --> 27:27.814
Of course. So...

27:27.847 --> 27:29.849
So it's not pure science,
it's interpretive.

27:29.882 --> 27:31.350
It's an art,
if you will.

27:31.383 --> 27:33.853
CJIS has an accuracy
rate of 99.7%.

27:33.886 --> 27:36.155
That's 3,000 mistakes
per every million searches.

27:36.188 --> 27:37.890
Do me a favor
and recheck the print

27:37.924 --> 27:39.726
against Salazar's other fingers.

27:39.759 --> 27:40.860
I don't have to.

27:40.893 --> 27:43.029
This ridge form is known as

27:43.062 --> 27:44.697
a butcher's hook.
It's rare,

27:44.731 --> 27:46.065
and Salazar
doesn't have it.

27:47.767 --> 27:49.201
On any finger.

28:06.152 --> 28:08.855
Okay, tell me
I'm crazy.

28:08.888 --> 28:10.389
I think I've just
found a way

28:10.422 --> 28:12.058
to express
Calabi-Yau manifolds

28:12.091 --> 28:14.160
in a way that goes
beyond the existence

28:14.193 --> 28:16.996
of a nonvanishing
harmonic spinor.

28:17.029 --> 28:20.366
Ch... Charles.

28:20.399 --> 28:21.868
Has he been out there all night?

28:21.901 --> 28:23.069
Well, on the bright side,

28:23.102 --> 28:26.038
it seems like Don's taken up
an interest in sports again.

28:26.072 --> 28:28.207
It's like the evidence
proves him right

28:28.240 --> 28:29.909
and wrong at the same time.

28:29.942 --> 28:33.412
Oh, yeah, the old paradox
of Schroedinger's Cat.

28:33.445 --> 28:36.749
Is that that Persian that keeps
hiding out in our garage?

28:36.783 --> 28:38.517
Mm-mm, it's
an intellectual exercise.

28:38.550 --> 28:39.752
I knew that.

28:39.786 --> 28:40.753
Okay,

28:40.787 --> 28:41.888
this is vastly simplified.

28:41.921 --> 28:45.057
There's a cat
in a box.

28:45.091 --> 28:47.293
50-50 chance it's been poisoned,

28:47.326 --> 28:48.494
but now here's

28:48.527 --> 28:50.196
the paradox:
Until such time

28:50.229 --> 28:52.932
as we can open the box,
and observe the cat,

28:52.965 --> 28:55.067
for that time,
that cat is both alive

28:55.101 --> 28:56.903
and dead.

28:56.936 --> 28:59.071
Larry, I-I-I fail
to see the analogy, though.

28:59.105 --> 29:00.039
I mean,

29:00.072 --> 29:01.273
in reality, Don can't be

29:01.307 --> 29:03.209
both right and wrong
at the same time.

29:03.242 --> 29:04.443
ALAN:
Well, of course not.

29:04.476 --> 29:06.846
I mean, if a man is
both right and wrong,

29:06.879 --> 29:08.180
something's gotta be wrong.

29:08.214 --> 29:10.783
No. The truth
of Schroedinger's Cat

29:10.817 --> 29:13.119
is that the question
itself is meaningless

29:13.152 --> 29:16.122
until we look inside the box.

29:25.097 --> 29:26.065
Let's say

29:26.098 --> 29:27.566
that I'm Alan Iverson.

29:27.599 --> 29:28.801
Charlie, I'm not in the mood.

29:28.835 --> 29:31.137
And I'm the only person in the
world that can get past you

29:31.170 --> 29:32.204
for two points.

29:34.340 --> 29:35.842
I just proved
I'm Alan Iverson.

29:35.875 --> 29:37.443
No, you just proved that,
20 years later,

29:37.476 --> 29:39.145
I'm still falling
for the same fake.

29:39.178 --> 29:40.546
It's a syllogistic fallacy.

29:40.579 --> 29:42.214
It's based
on a wrong assumption.

29:42.248 --> 29:43.215
Yeah?

29:43.249 --> 29:44.550
I'm obviously

29:44.583 --> 29:45.952
- not Alan Iverson.
- Yeah.

29:45.985 --> 29:47.453
Saying that I am,
then proposing

29:47.486 --> 29:48.988
a test doesn't change that.

29:49.021 --> 29:51.357
So what does this have
to do with my case?

29:51.390 --> 29:52.324
You found a link between

29:52.358 --> 29:54.426
Salazar and Lisa Bayle
because you thought

29:54.460 --> 29:56.262
he was guilty,
and what if you're wrong?

29:56.295 --> 29:59.098
Then finding
a link to Lisa Bayle

29:59.131 --> 30:00.532
won't make you right.

30:00.566 --> 30:02.835
Maybe there's
a different link

30:02.869 --> 30:03.936
that'll tell you more.

30:03.970 --> 30:06.472
Like a link
between the victims.

30:06.505 --> 30:07.773
Which would mean
a... could mean

30:07.806 --> 30:11.978
a completely different killer,
not Howard or Salazar.

30:12.011 --> 30:12.979
Right.

30:13.012 --> 30:14.513
So is this math or logic?

30:14.546 --> 30:15.581
Same thing.

30:18.550 --> 30:20.486
No.

30:20.519 --> 30:22.955
No.

30:22.989 --> 30:24.323
No.

30:24.356 --> 30:25.524
What about him?

30:25.557 --> 30:26.859
No.

30:30.162 --> 30:32.264
He's always in cage four.

30:32.298 --> 30:33.332
Tuesday-Thursday guy.

30:33.365 --> 30:35.101
Me, I'm usually here five,

30:35.134 --> 30:37.103
- six days a week.
- Let me ask you this:

30:37.136 --> 30:38.237
Do you, by any chance,

30:38.270 --> 30:40.239
recall if he was here
Thursday morning, the eighth?

30:41.373 --> 30:43.943
I went to Vegas on the ninth.

30:43.976 --> 30:45.144
Yeah, he was here.

30:45.177 --> 30:46.312
Yeah?

30:46.345 --> 30:48.147
Yeah.

30:48.180 --> 30:49.015
DAVID:
Conflicting witnesses.

30:49.048 --> 30:50.216
This guy puts Salazar here

30:50.249 --> 30:51.884
at the time of
the Riley murder.

30:51.918 --> 30:53.352
Riley's neighbor,
Mark Andric,

30:53.385 --> 30:55.021
he puts him at the scene.

30:55.054 --> 30:57.023
And you know, Andric
works over at Westmore.

30:57.056 --> 30:58.958
I'll bet he's probably
getting in around now.

30:58.991 --> 31:00.893
Maybe we should go
and see if we can get him

31:00.927 --> 31:02.028
to clarify a thing
or two, huh?

31:02.061 --> 31:03.562
Okay. Put any
more thought

31:03.595 --> 31:05.364
into playing for
the FBI team?

31:05.397 --> 31:08.167
Ah, you know. I played
minor league ball.

31:08.200 --> 31:09.668
The Stockton Rangers.

31:09.701 --> 31:12.471
My last time up at bat,
pitcher's on fumes, right?

31:12.504 --> 31:15.975
Throws me a gopher ball, I mean
the kind of fat, slow pitch

31:16.008 --> 31:17.643
you know is going
over the fence.

31:17.676 --> 31:19.045
Aw... you missed it.

31:19.078 --> 31:20.146
Doubled.

31:20.179 --> 31:21.447
Okay.

31:21.480 --> 31:23.082
By the time I got
around first,

31:23.115 --> 31:25.051
I knew in my heart
I'd never be more

31:25.084 --> 31:28.120
than a mediocre
single-A player.

31:28.154 --> 31:31.090
Signed up for the FBI
entrance exam the next day.

31:31.123 --> 31:32.524
( bell ringing )

31:39.098 --> 31:40.666
Wait, I've seen that crest.

31:43.102 --> 31:44.937
Lisa Bayle's daughter
goes to this school.

31:44.971 --> 31:46.605
I think she plays the violin.

31:46.638 --> 31:48.174
That's gotta be
the connection

31:48.207 --> 31:50.342
The kid takes music
lessons from Andric.

31:50.376 --> 31:52.111
Bayle and Riley
know the same man

31:52.144 --> 31:53.579
and they're killed
the exact same way.

31:53.612 --> 31:54.680
- It's not a coincidence.
- No.

31:59.285 --> 32:01.220
Excuse me.
We're with the FBI.

32:01.253 --> 32:02.588
Is this Mark Andric's classroom?

32:02.621 --> 32:04.590
Uh... yeah. He's out
sick. I'm the sub.

32:04.623 --> 32:05.591
Sir, I'd like

32:05.624 --> 32:07.059
to look through
this drawer.

32:07.093 --> 32:08.127
Is that okay with you?

32:08.160 --> 32:09.128
Yeah, sure.

32:09.161 --> 32:10.963
How long you been here?

32:10.997 --> 32:12.564
Just over a week.

32:12.598 --> 32:14.200
A week.

32:15.134 --> 32:16.735
FBI warrant!

32:16.768 --> 32:17.303
FBI!

32:17.336 --> 32:18.237
Warrant!

32:20.406 --> 32:22.008
TERRY:
Going to the right.

32:22.041 --> 32:23.042
FBI warrant!

32:24.243 --> 32:25.211
Clear!

32:25.244 --> 32:26.145
Clear!

32:31.017 --> 32:32.184
TERRY:
Bedroom's clear.

32:33.285 --> 32:35.154
He's gone.

32:41.693 --> 32:44.230
DON:
The man we know as Mark Andric

32:44.263 --> 32:46.332
came here from Bosnia,
10 years ago.

32:46.365 --> 32:48.200
However...

32:48.234 --> 32:51.137
These fingerprints identify him
as former Serbian Army

32:51.170 --> 32:53.139
Lieutenant Ramus Zeljada.

32:54.506 --> 32:55.741
His right index finger has

32:55.774 --> 32:57.309
a perfect butcher's
hook ridge form.

32:57.343 --> 32:59.245
This is the same
formation that was found

32:59.278 --> 33:01.247
on Lisa Bayle's body.

33:01.280 --> 33:02.481
Must've figured out
who Andric really was.

33:02.514 --> 33:03.482
And given
his history,

33:03.515 --> 33:04.283
I think it's safe

33:04.316 --> 33:06.285
to assume he used
blackmail to try

33:06.318 --> 33:07.286
to keep him quiet.

33:07.319 --> 33:08.387
But Zeljada,
being a sociopath,

33:08.420 --> 33:09.421
he kills Riley instead.

33:09.455 --> 33:10.489
Then he threw us Salazar

33:10.522 --> 33:12.158
to give himself
time to disappear.

33:12.191 --> 33:13.459
So we got two
innocent men in jail

33:13.492 --> 33:15.327
and he's got
an eight-day lead on us,

33:15.361 --> 33:17.396
so please, let's kick it in
and see what we can do.

33:25.371 --> 33:29.408
Andric lived in four cities
in the last ten years:

33:29.441 --> 33:33.479
Sydney, New York, Chicago, L.A.

33:33.512 --> 33:35.647
Question is
where does he go next?

33:35.681 --> 33:37.416
He's been moving west.

33:37.449 --> 33:40.152
San Francisco? Honolulu?

33:40.186 --> 33:41.453
The man knows how
to stay anonymous;

33:41.487 --> 33:43.255
not even a parking ticket
to his name.

33:43.289 --> 33:45.457
They've got him.

33:45.491 --> 33:46.525
Off a credit card used

33:46.558 --> 33:48.294
at an Econo Xpress
in Washington.

33:48.327 --> 33:50.129
Seattle SWAT has the room
surrounded.

33:50.162 --> 33:51.163
All right.

33:51.197 --> 33:52.598
The suspects surrendered

33:52.631 --> 33:54.800
after ten minutes
of negotiation,

33:54.833 --> 33:56.168
unarmed and compliant.

33:56.202 --> 33:57.536
Hold on. You say "suspects"?

33:57.569 --> 33:59.138
We thought he was alone.

33:59.171 --> 34:02.174
He picked up a partner
at a truck stop in Bakersfield.

34:02.208 --> 34:05.811
White male, 20s,
stunningly poor hygiene.

34:05.844 --> 34:08.180
Their hotel room was set up for
low-level meth manufacturing.

34:08.214 --> 34:10.149
Looks like they were settling in
for a couple of weeks.

34:10.182 --> 34:12.418
Here's your suspect.

34:12.451 --> 34:14.686
Who's that?

34:14.720 --> 34:16.288
The credit cards you had,
where'd you get them?

34:16.322 --> 34:18.390
Uh, a Mark something.

34:18.424 --> 34:20.659
I-I know him from a bar in L.A.

34:20.692 --> 34:23.229
I needed to get out of town.

34:23.262 --> 34:25.397
He sold me the card for 200.

34:31.870 --> 34:38.344
Sydney, New York, Chicago, L.A.

34:38.377 --> 34:42.714
All cities with mass transit,
fine arts, architecture.

34:42.748 --> 34:43.815
They're all near bodies
of water,

34:43.849 --> 34:45.317
have easy access
to transportation.

34:45.351 --> 34:48.620
Charlie, anything mathematical,
logical?

34:48.654 --> 34:49.755
I don't know.

34:49.788 --> 34:52.858
You guys have all the experience
in finding fugitives.

35:05.404 --> 35:06.738
Don...

35:09.275 --> 35:13.445
...remember how you could never
lay off low and outside pitches?

35:13.479 --> 35:14.546
What?!

35:14.580 --> 35:15.547
Sorry, but low
and outside,

35:15.581 --> 35:18.184
you couldn't stop swinging
at those pitches,

35:18.217 --> 35:19.117
no matter how many times
you missed,

35:19.151 --> 35:19.985
no matter how much
it hurt your average.

35:20.018 --> 35:22.188
Charlie, what are you
talking about?

35:22.221 --> 35:23.689
CHARLIE: Everyone has something
they like to do,

35:23.722 --> 35:26.392
they can't help doing.

35:26.425 --> 35:27.793
You can't help but swing
at low and outside pitches.

35:27.826 --> 35:28.794
What does Andric do?

35:28.827 --> 35:31.297
What can't he stay away from?

35:31.330 --> 35:32.598
Remember when
we first talked to him,

35:32.631 --> 35:33.599
he was listening to opera?

35:33.632 --> 35:34.500
Said he'd been at the opera

35:34.533 --> 35:35.767
the night they found
Lisa Bayle's body.

35:35.801 --> 35:37.336
All four cities where
he's lived,

35:37.369 --> 35:38.904
they have world-class opera
companies.

35:38.937 --> 35:41.673
- Hey, you're right.
- See if there's

35:41.707 --> 35:43.809
any major operas in L.A.
right now.

35:43.842 --> 35:45.777
That's why he sold his credit
cards to a drug dealer

35:45.811 --> 35:46.812
for almost no money.

35:46.845 --> 35:47.746
Yeah, to create a false trail,

35:47.779 --> 35:49.815
to make it appear
like he's leaving town

35:49.848 --> 35:51.250
when he's actually
still here, man,

35:51.283 --> 35:52.851
and he just doesn't want
you to know.

35:52.884 --> 35:53.952
Zeljada had a poster

35:53.985 --> 35:54.820
of the singer
Magdalena Urnatova

35:54.853 --> 35:55.921
in his apartment.

35:55.954 --> 35:57.523
Her final performance
of Aida is tonight

35:57.556 --> 35:59.625
at the Dorothy Chandler
Pavilion.

35:59.658 --> 36:02.694
All right, well...
who likes opera?

36:31.990 --> 36:32.991
Anything?

36:33.024 --> 36:35.294
Not yet.

36:41.667 --> 36:42.768
DAVID ( over radio ):
We have a visual on the suspect.

36:42.801 --> 36:43.735
Continue to follow.

36:43.769 --> 36:45.237
DON ( over radio ):
Stay on him.

36:46.438 --> 36:48.274
David, you got him?

36:49.441 --> 36:50.276
DAVID:
Haven't seen him yet.

36:55.046 --> 36:56.948
Suspect's headed into
the plaza!

36:56.982 --> 36:58.384
( woman screams )
I got him!

36:58.417 --> 37:00.819
- DON: Go!
- DAVID: I'm in pursuit!

37:00.852 --> 37:02.354
Move!

37:06.057 --> 37:07.693
Get back! Move!

37:07.726 --> 37:09.328
Andric!

37:09.361 --> 37:10.262
Get out
of the way!

37:10.296 --> 37:10.829
Get out of the way!

37:16.402 --> 37:18.470
Do not move!

37:18.504 --> 37:19.271
Stop resisting!

37:19.305 --> 37:21.473
There's a gun
against your head!

37:21.507 --> 37:23.275
AGENT: All agents,
suspect is in custody.

37:30.849 --> 37:31.750
I give him credit;

37:31.783 --> 37:34.386
he knows how to resist
an interrogation.

37:34.420 --> 37:35.253
Well, I mean,

37:35.287 --> 37:36.788
compared to what
he's used to in Bosnia,

37:36.822 --> 37:38.724
this is a cakewalk.

37:38.757 --> 37:40.726
I still don't understand
why he killed Lisa Bayle.

37:40.759 --> 37:43.529
What's his motive?

37:43.562 --> 37:44.396
JONAS:
Mark Andric...

37:44.430 --> 37:46.498
yeah,

37:46.532 --> 37:47.999
Lisa knew him...

37:48.033 --> 37:50.869
She spent a lot of time with him

37:50.902 --> 37:53.705
because she volunteered
at the high school.

37:53.739 --> 37:58.444
They worked together on a school
history project of some sort.

37:58.477 --> 37:59.545
Now, Jonas, I know

37:59.578 --> 38:00.779
how hard this is for you.

38:00.812 --> 38:02.648
It's not easy
for me to ask, but...

38:02.681 --> 38:04.082
You want to know
did I suspect

38:04.115 --> 38:06.051
there was something going on
between them.

38:06.084 --> 38:07.986
Yeah.

38:08.019 --> 38:11.757
Yes, I did...
though I wasn't sure.

38:11.790 --> 38:13.024
I don't understand.

38:13.058 --> 38:15.561
I mean, why didn't you tell me
that before?

38:15.594 --> 38:17.363
Didn't you think
the possibility

38:17.396 --> 38:18.897
that she was
having an affair

38:18.930 --> 38:21.032
might be connected
to her death in some way?

38:21.066 --> 38:24.336
Look, first off,
I was your chief suspect.

38:25.604 --> 38:27.005
If you knew that I thought

38:27.038 --> 38:28.607
she was having an affair,

38:28.640 --> 38:31.009
that would have convinced you
I was guilty.

38:31.042 --> 38:33.579
Anyway,
almost immediately,

38:33.612 --> 38:35.847
you arrested Cliff Howard,
and he confessed.

38:38.784 --> 38:43.489
Okay... this is my last
difficult question.

38:43.522 --> 38:46.492
Lisa was three months pregnant
at the time.

38:47.659 --> 38:49.961
I don't think the baby was mine.

38:53.799 --> 38:56.602
But after she died...

38:56.635 --> 38:59.705
( sighs )

38:59.738 --> 39:03.909
I didn't want to dwell on it.

39:03.942 --> 39:06.545
And it didn't seem
to have anything

39:06.578 --> 39:07.846
to do with why she died.

39:10.482 --> 39:12.584
Do you think now that it did?

39:12.618 --> 39:14.686
Yeah, I do.

39:18.189 --> 39:19.625
The eyewitness was wrong.

39:19.658 --> 39:21.460
The fingerprint technician
made a mistake.

39:23.161 --> 39:24.396
A mistake?!

39:27.766 --> 39:28.967
Man, how can that be?

39:31.603 --> 39:34.873
You know, I mean,
we pretty much use science

39:34.906 --> 39:36.708
for everything we do
these days, and I think...

39:39.445 --> 39:41.513
...you know, as long as
there's people involved,

39:41.547 --> 39:42.648
there's, there's
going to be

39:42.681 --> 39:44.783
mistakes.

39:44.816 --> 39:47.018
Not to justify it, but...

39:47.052 --> 39:48.820
I'm sorry.

39:51.222 --> 39:54.125
The first thing I said to you

39:54.159 --> 39:56.862
is that I didn't do it.

39:56.895 --> 40:00.532
I know.
I told you I remember.

40:34.733 --> 40:36.635
( engine starts )

40:45.744 --> 40:46.978
( clank )

40:49.848 --> 40:50.782
( clank )

40:50.816 --> 40:52.651
Your sucker pitch--
low and outside, man.

40:52.684 --> 40:53.652
You didn't swing.

40:53.685 --> 40:55.587
You don't say?

40:55.621 --> 40:56.888
You know, I've been running
some numbers

40:56.922 --> 40:57.889
from your minor league days.

40:57.923 --> 40:58.824
I wanted to see which ones

40:58.857 --> 41:00.225
are the best pitches
for you to go after.

41:00.258 --> 41:00.959
Charlie, I don't like
to think

41:00.992 --> 41:02.060
about it too much,
all right?

41:02.093 --> 41:02.928
Why not?

41:02.961 --> 41:04.162
If you can analyze
your performance,

41:04.195 --> 41:05.230
you can improve it, Don.

41:05.263 --> 41:07.666
Some things are
about how it feels.

41:07.699 --> 41:09.701
I think I can quantify
what feels right

41:09.735 --> 41:11.136
about a particular pitch.

41:16.642 --> 41:18.744
Oh, yeah.

41:18.777 --> 41:22.948
I think the FBI might have
a new power hitter this season.

41:22.981 --> 41:23.048
I'd say so.
