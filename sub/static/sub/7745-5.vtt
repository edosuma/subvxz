00:08.718 --> 00:10.136
<i>Previously on</i> Nurse <i>Jackie...</i>

00:10.220 --> 00:12.639
Someone forgot to schedule
any nurses for the day shift tomorrow

00:12.722 --> 00:14.307
or the late shift tomorrow night.

00:14.391 --> 00:17.435
I am this close to reporting
her absentminded ass to the board.

00:17.519 --> 00:21.815
This is where I grow some sack
and tell you I canceled our reservation.

00:21.898 --> 00:25.026
Actually, this is where I get bored
and walk away.

00:25.110 --> 00:26.820
See you on the outside?

00:28.863 --> 00:30.198
Charlie?

00:33.743 --> 00:35.954
Jesus Christ.

00:36.037 --> 00:38.540
I just need to get something.

00:38.623 --> 00:40.917
Real quick.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.377
Take it in.

00:42.460 --> 00:43.795
I'm sorry, are you flirting with me?

00:43.920 --> 00:45.130
Well, that just killed it.

00:46.423 --> 00:49.926
So do you want to do this again?
Because I do.

00:50.885 --> 00:53.263
I am a recovering drug addict.

00:53.388 --> 00:55.265
So it's a date.

00:56.307 --> 00:58.476
What are you doing
coming out of the subway?

00:58.643 --> 01:01.646
- She has a boyfriend.
- A boyfriend?

01:01.730 --> 01:04.190
You're 17, she is 14.

01:04.274 --> 01:06.276
This is not happening.

02:11.049 --> 02:12.842
Good morning.

02:15.011 --> 02:19.516
So, me, Taylor and Crosby are doing
Hunger Games tonight at Madison's.

02:19.599 --> 02:22.602
- Those are all girls, right?
- Yes, all girls.

02:22.685 --> 02:24.312
And Madison's mom will be there?

02:24.395 --> 02:27.190
- Of course.
- Okay, because you know I will call her.

02:29.692 --> 02:32.195
Are you going to the gym?

02:32.278 --> 02:35.949
Yes. It's very hard to be a role model.

02:49.712 --> 02:51.840
- What's in the bag?
- Oh, my God. Zoey!

02:51.923 --> 02:54.926
- Jesus! Don't scare me!
- I didn't...

02:55.885 --> 02:57.595
So what's in the gym bag?

02:57.679 --> 03:00.557
That would be none of your business.

03:02.225 --> 03:04.394
I know you are not going to the gym.

03:05.436 --> 03:08.606
- Money?
- No.

03:11.818 --> 03:13.987
- Heroin?
- Heroin. Yes, it's heroin.

03:14.070 --> 03:16.364
No, it's not heroin. It's a dress.

03:16.447 --> 03:18.992
It's a couple of dresses, okay?

03:19.075 --> 03:24.497
You either have a job interview
or you're going on a date.

03:25.832 --> 03:27.834
A date.

03:27.917 --> 03:30.879
I knew it. With the cop.

03:30.962 --> 03:32.881
Did I call it?

03:32.964 --> 03:34.716
Yes, I called it.

03:34.799 --> 03:36.968
You wore me down.
You just dragged it out of me.

03:37.051 --> 03:38.511
Can we be at work now, please?

03:38.595 --> 03:40.597
They're gonna wrinkle in there.

03:40.722 --> 03:41.890
I'll hang them up.

03:43.516 --> 03:46.102
Okay, fine. Hang them up.
What the hell? Go hang them up.

03:47.437 --> 03:50.315
I can be your bridesmaid today, if you want.

03:50.398 --> 03:52.275
You don't want.

03:56.738 --> 03:59.490
I just stepped off a curb
and twisted my knee.

03:59.574 --> 04:01.492
- I feel like an idiot.
- Yep.

04:03.620 --> 04:05.455
- It says here you're a dancer.
- Alvin Ailey.

04:05.580 --> 04:08.458
First show opens in two weeks. Now this.

04:08.541 --> 04:09.876
Yeah, that's great. Bend.

04:11.085 --> 04:14.547
Bet you didn't know that Dr. Prentiss here
is a huge fan of modern dance.

04:14.631 --> 04:17.133
Yeah, I like modern okay,
but actually I'm more of an ABT man.

04:19.385 --> 04:20.803
<i>Seen Don Quixote? Killed.</i>

04:22.972 --> 04:24.140
What?

04:26.684 --> 04:30.104
Get him up to X-ray
in a five, six, seven, eight.

04:30.188 --> 04:32.106
We are running low on suture kits.

04:32.190 --> 04:35.526
How can an ER run low on suture kits?

04:36.986 --> 04:39.739
Gloria, you said you were going
to order the suture kits.

04:42.742 --> 04:44.369
Pardon the interruption.

04:45.662 --> 04:47.956
Feel free to use my office
to change for your date.

04:53.836 --> 04:56.839
Can you get this filled for his pain, please?

05:00.718 --> 05:02.303
You don't have to be nervous.

05:03.096 --> 05:04.681
Who's nervous? Why would I be nervous?

05:04.764 --> 05:07.475
About your date with that cop.

05:07.558 --> 05:08.935
He seems all right.

05:09.018 --> 05:12.271
Can anybody have any
privacy around this place?

05:12.355 --> 05:15.316
Privacy in a hospital? Please.

05:15.400 --> 05:17.443
There's a reason the gowns
don't close in the back.

05:17.527 --> 05:19.570
That's hilarious.

05:21.072 --> 05:24.367
First date since you split up with Kev.
It's gotta be weird.

05:24.575 --> 05:26.661
I'd kill for weird.

05:31.249 --> 05:33.710
I've never been sober in a dress.

05:38.548 --> 05:40.466
Don't freak out. It's just a date.

05:40.550 --> 05:44.095
Get dressed, show up, you'll be fine.

05:44.178 --> 05:45.763
Believe me, you do that,

05:45.847 --> 05:47.807
there's not a man in the world
that won't be happy.

05:48.850 --> 05:50.059
Thanks, Eddie.

05:55.898 --> 05:57.984
- Feel better?
- Nope.

06:03.906 --> 06:05.992
Christ.

06:06.075 --> 06:08.161
Stressing?

06:08.661 --> 06:11.414
The world of dating is not
for the faint of heart, Jackie.

06:11.497 --> 06:14.083
I bet you look at me and think,

06:14.167 --> 06:15.877
"There's a man with confidence.

06:15.960 --> 06:20.214
"There's a man whose romantic life
rolls easy."

06:21.549 --> 06:23.760
I do everything but throw up before a date.

06:23.843 --> 06:26.179
I won't tell a soul.

06:26.262 --> 06:29.640
Let me show you a little something
that works for me.

06:36.105 --> 06:39.859
Quiet room, flat on the floor.

06:41.319 --> 06:43.237
Deep breathing.

06:44.947 --> 06:47.825
Zen magic.

06:47.909 --> 06:50.369
- Hey, Carrie.
- Hey, Coop.

06:54.040 --> 06:55.416
It's magic.

07:00.630 --> 07:03.007
- Jackie.
- Yeah.

07:06.302 --> 07:10.556
I know it's like a foreign object to you.
It's lipstick for tonight.

07:10.640 --> 07:12.225
Okay. No secrets here.

07:12.809 --> 07:13.976
Do you like it?

07:15.812 --> 07:18.231
- Yeah, it's very nice.
-It's all yours.

07:18.314 --> 07:20.566
Really? Thank you.

07:20.691 --> 07:26.489
Any chance I could get you to steer
that head lice guy to some other doc?

07:26.656 --> 07:28.407
No.

07:28.491 --> 07:31.160
Just keep it.

07:31.244 --> 07:33.371
I have hundreds.

07:37.667 --> 07:40.044
Help me! Please!

07:43.381 --> 07:44.841
I got shot.

07:45.007 --> 07:46.843
Give me some help here.

07:47.802 --> 07:49.846
I think I'm gonna be sick.

07:49.929 --> 07:51.180
Jesus. A pumper.

07:51.264 --> 07:53.599
Prentiss is coming and a gurney.

07:53.683 --> 07:55.768
Get them out, please. Get them out.

07:57.854 --> 07:59.105
It's a walk-in GSW.

07:59.188 --> 08:01.899
Keep that pressure on. That's perfect.

08:02.024 --> 08:04.110
- Stay with us, honey.
- Let's get her in there.

08:04.193 --> 08:06.487
Holy shiznit. Baby's coming.

08:06.571 --> 08:08.322
- We can't move her now.
- Yeah, she's crowning.

08:08.406 --> 08:09.615
Okay, I'm gonna need you
to swap with Jackie.

08:09.699 --> 08:13.661
Thor, get me some warm blankets,
an OB kit and an infant warmer now.

08:13.744 --> 08:15.371
Zoey's got it.

08:16.998 --> 08:19.167
Okay, hon, start pushing.

08:20.084 --> 08:21.627
My baby!

08:21.711 --> 08:23.504
Her name's Michelle.

08:23.588 --> 08:27.550
Hi, Michelle. Your baby's coming.
Don't worry. I'm right here.

08:30.052 --> 08:34.223
Okay, stop pushing now and blow like this...

08:34.307 --> 08:35.725
She's stable, but we gotta get her upstairs.

08:35.892 --> 08:38.519
- How close?
- Michelle, you're doing a great job.

08:38.603 --> 08:40.062
A nice big push, okay?

08:41.898 --> 08:44.275
Getting there. Breathe.

08:45.401 --> 08:47.486
Give me a push.

08:47.570 --> 08:49.739
Good. Keep breathing.

08:49.864 --> 08:51.490
Give me another push.

08:52.658 --> 08:53.910
One more.

08:54.911 --> 08:56.454
It's a girl.

08:57.413 --> 08:59.874
Okay, there we go.
You've got it.

08:59.957 --> 09:01.083
Let's cut the cord.

09:12.929 --> 09:14.931
All right.

09:15.765 --> 09:17.350
Okay, on my count.

09:17.433 --> 09:20.728
One, two, three. Easy.

09:22.480 --> 09:23.940
Let's go.

09:34.200 --> 09:35.618
Favorite trauma ever.

09:35.701 --> 09:38.120
I feel so alive,
like I just ate a bunch of fresh fish.

09:38.204 --> 09:40.539
I am this close to Tebowing.

09:41.123 --> 09:42.291
Off to radiology.

09:42.375 --> 09:45.294
Excuse me, who's helping you
get dressed for your date tonight?

09:45.378 --> 09:48.506
Nobody. I'm a grown-up.

09:48.589 --> 09:49.715
Hey.

09:49.799 --> 09:51.884
You did all right today.

09:55.763 --> 09:57.974
Are you kidding me?

09:58.057 --> 10:00.893
No one saw that?

10:00.977 --> 10:04.605
I am on fire here, people.

10:10.027 --> 10:12.363
- All right, what are you doing?
- Does this thing get Skype?

10:13.322 --> 10:14.865
- What?
- Skype.

10:14.949 --> 10:17.952
You know, you-look-at-people-while-
you-talk-to-them Skype, Skype?

10:18.035 --> 10:19.996
I don't know. Who you calling?

10:21.163 --> 10:23.124
English doctor friend.

10:23.207 --> 10:25.960
She's a girl and she's fancy, no offense.

10:26.043 --> 10:27.253
None taken.

10:27.336 --> 10:29.255
Isn't it, like, midnight in London?

10:29.338 --> 10:31.465
She's got a baby. There's no sleeping.

10:32.842 --> 10:35.052
Okay. It's downloading.

10:36.178 --> 10:38.514
- What the fuck?
-It's not them, all right?

10:38.639 --> 10:40.850
It's the computer. It's a relic.

10:40.933 --> 10:43.436
Not so hard on the keys, please.

10:43.519 --> 10:47.273
- It's one date.
- Yeah, easy for you to say.

10:47.356 --> 10:49.608
One date.

10:49.692 --> 10:51.777
Yeah, I don't know what can happen
watching The Hunger Games.

10:51.861 --> 10:55.364
You know, I'd just feel better
if there's a parent there.

10:55.448 --> 10:56.866
I know.

10:56.949 --> 10:58.534
Thanks, Elaine.

11:01.037 --> 11:02.663
What's the deal with Akalitus?

11:02.747 --> 11:05.958
Besides being awesome at the GSW today?

11:06.042 --> 11:07.585
Okay, so she went back to being a nurse

11:07.668 --> 11:09.128
for about 10 minutes,
and she was a good one.

11:09.211 --> 11:11.505
But as an administrator, come on.

11:11.589 --> 11:14.008
She forgot to order those
suture kits today, didn't she?

11:14.091 --> 11:16.802
She also forgot
to schedule two nurse shifts.

11:16.886 --> 11:20.681
Hell, she even named me chief
without telling anyone, including me.

11:20.765 --> 11:22.641
All right, what do you want?

11:22.725 --> 11:27.021
I want to know in a life-death business
that we're all here.

11:33.486 --> 11:36.155
I wanted to see how you were doing.

11:37.156 --> 11:39.241
- You want to hold her?
- Yes.

11:49.460 --> 11:50.586
What's her name?

11:51.504 --> 11:52.797
Don't have one yet.

11:53.756 --> 11:55.424
What's your name?

11:57.843 --> 11:58.928
Zoey.

12:03.349 --> 12:04.850
What's your middle name?

12:04.934 --> 12:07.353
It's okay.

12:08.938 --> 12:11.482
X-ray's clean. Looks like
you only have a sprained knee.

12:11.565 --> 12:13.567
Keep that bandage on it
and ice and elevate, okay?

12:13.651 --> 12:15.277
Really? I'm fine?

12:15.361 --> 12:17.905
- You're fine.
- Get rest. You'll be ready for your opening.

12:17.988 --> 12:19.615
File this.

12:29.500 --> 12:32.211
- Dr. Cooper?
- That is me.

12:32.294 --> 12:33.712
Look at this.

12:33.796 --> 12:37.049
This is not the X-ray of a man
that should be discharged.

12:37.133 --> 12:39.218
Am I correct?

12:39.301 --> 12:41.262
Fuckin' A. Where is this guy?

12:41.345 --> 12:43.097
Prentiss just let him go.

12:44.890 --> 12:46.392
You're gonna wanna be there for this.

12:46.475 --> 12:49.145
- Wait, wait!
- What are you doing?

12:49.270 --> 12:50.938
Your patient does not have a sprained knee.

12:51.021 --> 12:53.315
It's a spiral fracture. Look.

12:53.399 --> 12:55.067
See all these microscopic splinters?

12:55.151 --> 12:57.194
That's where the bone has
literally twisted apart.

12:57.278 --> 12:59.947
The whole bone is completely unstable.

13:00.698 --> 13:02.491
- And you caught this?
- Yes.

13:02.616 --> 13:05.244
Well, she caught, I diagnosed.

13:09.415 --> 13:12.835
You are not gonna be discharged.
You're going up to ortho to see a surgeon.

13:12.918 --> 13:14.837
You'll be out of commission
for about six months,

13:14.920 --> 13:17.590
but you'll still have a career.

13:17.673 --> 13:19.467
I'll take him up.

13:22.845 --> 13:25.973
Hey, we all miss things sometimes.

13:26.056 --> 13:27.475
It's a whiff.

13:27.558 --> 13:29.393
- Shake it off.
- Yeah, whatever, man.

13:29.477 --> 13:32.521
So now it's Coop, one, Prentiss, 100.

13:35.774 --> 13:37.776
Fucking Prentiss.

13:37.860 --> 13:39.653
You saved his ass.

13:40.738 --> 13:43.782
I'm just gonna say it, I should be chief.

13:43.866 --> 13:45.034
You would be awesome.

13:48.537 --> 13:50.623
He fucked up.

13:51.290 --> 13:52.708
Look what he missed.

13:52.791 --> 13:55.127
The spiral fracture of the...

13:55.252 --> 13:57.213
- Medial condyle.
- Right.

13:59.632 --> 14:00.674
Coop,

14:02.384 --> 14:04.011
you're a born healer.

14:04.094 --> 14:09.225
You may not be ER chief, but you're mine.

14:11.018 --> 14:13.395
See? You get me.

14:13.604 --> 14:15.564
I do.

14:16.690 --> 14:18.150
Now you'll get me.

14:49.598 --> 14:51.642
Thank you, God.

14:51.725 --> 14:54.186
Thank you, guy with the fucked-up knee.

14:54.270 --> 14:57.481
Every time I call you, I wonder if I'm crazy.

15:03.529 --> 15:06.949
Well, I guess I'm only
crazy if you answer, right?

15:08.576 --> 15:10.286
I don't know what I'm doing.

15:10.369 --> 15:12.830
Why am I going on a date?
I don't wanna go on a date.

15:12.913 --> 15:16.375
What I wanna do is get a handful of pills

15:16.500 --> 15:18.794
and crush them up and snort a big fat line.

15:20.296 --> 15:23.090
Oh, man, I wish you were here.

15:32.933 --> 15:34.143
What are you doing?

15:34.226 --> 15:36.645
- I thought you were getting dressed.
- I don't think I can do this.

15:37.229 --> 15:40.441
- Not go?
- Come on, you just need a little help.

15:40.566 --> 15:44.695
I feel like I'm suddenly
on one of those makeover reality shows.

15:44.778 --> 15:47.489
- Zoey.
- That you hate, right.

15:47.573 --> 15:49.450
Do we even like any of this?

15:49.575 --> 15:51.994
You know, you're not making
me feel any better here, guys.

15:52.077 --> 15:54.747
These are really cute,
but they're crazy wrinkled.

16:10.888 --> 16:12.181
Wow.

16:14.266 --> 16:16.101
I'll be okay with those
shoes in a few minutes.

16:16.185 --> 16:17.978
We have to get a picture.

16:18.062 --> 16:21.607
- No, we really don't have to get...
- Of the whole team.

16:21.690 --> 16:23.067
Okay, we're gonna take a picture.

16:23.150 --> 16:24.360
Okay.

16:24.443 --> 16:26.779
Gouda.

16:26.904 --> 16:28.781
- Nice!
- Okay, I'm going to be late.

16:28.864 --> 16:30.616
Go, then. Go.

16:32.284 --> 16:33.327
Thank you, guys.

16:40.876 --> 16:43.212
Wow. Have fun.

17:31.260 --> 17:32.594
Hey, Danny.

17:41.603 --> 17:42.688
-Hey.
-Hey.

17:42.771 --> 17:44.523
- Sorry. Parking.
- That's all right.

17:44.606 --> 17:46.775
It'd be pretty awkward if I had
to get you out of a ticket tonight.

17:46.942 --> 17:49.528
Or write me one.

17:49.611 --> 17:51.196
You look great.

17:53.866 --> 17:56.118
I have never done that in my life.

17:56.827 --> 17:58.871
- So, this is it?
- Yeah.

17:58.954 --> 18:00.706
I was trying to figure out
what I was gonna have

18:00.789 --> 18:02.166
so I knew walking in.

18:02.249 --> 18:06.211
I'm gonna have a $40 salad and a $15 seltzer.

18:06.295 --> 18:08.255
You know the bubbles are imported?

18:08.338 --> 18:09.798
Of course they are.

18:10.841 --> 18:12.885
Well, you wanna go in?

18:18.682 --> 18:21.018
- You know what I would love?
- What?

18:21.477 --> 18:23.312
Fish and chips.

18:24.813 --> 18:26.231
I don't think they're gonna have that here.

18:26.315 --> 18:29.860
No, but I think there's this little place
on the corner.

18:30.611 --> 18:31.820
Yeah?

18:48.212 --> 18:50.422
- Two boys, huh?
- Yeah.

18:50.506 --> 18:52.549
I live in fart land.

18:54.468 --> 18:57.930
Well, I live in snarky stuffed animal cluster.

18:58.013 --> 18:59.431
One second they hate you,

18:59.515 --> 19:00.933
then they wanna sit on your lap.

19:01.016 --> 19:02.893
Yeah, well, you know the drill.
That's half the battle.

19:02.976 --> 19:05.395
Yeah, yeah. I'm a mother.
What are you gonna do?

19:05.479 --> 19:07.773
<i>You</i> gonna <i>finish</i> your <i>pommes frites?</i>

19:07.856 --> 19:09.483
By all means.

19:09.566 --> 19:10.734
Thank you.

19:10.818 --> 19:12.277
See? This is much better.

19:12.361 --> 19:14.696
Oh, boy, this is much better.

19:14.780 --> 19:17.115
I'm standing outside that French restaurant
waiting for you,

19:17.199 --> 19:19.743
I feel like I'm going up
this giant roller coaster.

19:19.827 --> 19:21.245
There's a big drop coming, you know?

19:22.704 --> 19:25.624
Yeah, I had a little bit of that myself today.

19:25.833 --> 19:29.378
Okay, first date after my divorce,
I'm nervous as hell.

19:29.461 --> 19:31.296
I take half a Valium to calm down.

19:31.380 --> 19:32.798
Pass out, miss the whole thing.

19:32.881 --> 19:35.801
Nice. Very nice.

19:39.721 --> 19:42.307
Look, I hope this doesn't scare you at all,

19:42.391 --> 19:43.559
but I really like you.

19:46.019 --> 19:48.647
Yeah, it does a little. But in a good way.

19:49.231 --> 19:50.899
I'll take it.

19:52.860 --> 19:54.486
Take it. You got kids.

19:59.199 --> 20:01.743
<i>- Hello?
- Lose the date.</i>

20:04.913 --> 20:06.623
I need to talk to you.

20:15.674 --> 20:16.884
You all right?

20:19.595 --> 20:21.263
Not really. I gotta go.

20:21.763 --> 20:24.683
- Is there anything I can do?
- No.

20:24.766 --> 20:27.185
- No. I gotta go.
- I get it. Kids come first.

20:27.269 --> 20:29.313
- Go ahead. Get outta here.
- I'm so sorry.

20:31.940 --> 20:34.192
Little bastards.

20:48.290 --> 20:49.917
I don't think I should be here.

20:50.626 --> 20:52.502
Danny, let's just go.

20:53.295 --> 20:55.422
I'm going.

21:02.971 --> 21:04.765
Hey, you wanna party?

21:41.510 --> 21:43.220
I couldn't get rid of his phone.

21:45.973 --> 21:48.976
I heard your messages. All of them.

21:53.522 --> 21:55.691
He was such a sweet boy.

22:00.654 --> 22:03.532
It's no matter which picture I look at...

22:07.828 --> 22:09.871
They say time heals.

22:11.206 --> 22:13.333
It's bullshit.

22:14.376 --> 22:16.920
Time's a thief.

22:19.548 --> 22:21.425
You seeing anyone?

22:21.591 --> 22:23.135
Like a counselor?

22:27.264 --> 22:28.849
Women?

22:30.267 --> 22:32.352
None I could trust.

22:51.747 --> 22:54.666
You're the only person who knew him.

22:54.750 --> 22:56.626
I miss him all the time.

23:30.869 --> 23:32.370
Mom?

23:33.163 --> 23:35.916
It's me again. Where are you?

23:49.137 --> 23:50.222
Hey.

23:51.306 --> 23:52.390
Hay is for horses.

24:03.110 --> 24:04.236
Where are you going?

24:04.361 --> 24:05.821
It's my phone.

24:07.823 --> 24:09.074
Shit.

24:09.157 --> 24:10.617
Fuck.

24:10.700 --> 24:12.744
- What?
-It's Grace.

24:12.828 --> 24:14.830
She called me like 10 times.

24:16.456 --> 24:18.542
Oh, God.

24:21.128 --> 24:22.921
Oh, my God.
