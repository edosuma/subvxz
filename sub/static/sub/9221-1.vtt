02:04.708 --> 02:05.708
Charles...

02:05.958 --> 02:07.073
Isn't this great?

02:07.333 --> 02:08.333
Yeah.

02:12.500 --> 02:13.831
Good afternoon.

02:19.583 --> 02:21.744
What wouldn't I do
to get my hands on her.

02:22.000 --> 02:23.786
Get your hands on who?

02:24.250 --> 02:27.208
"The challenger." $20-million airplane.

02:27.667 --> 02:29.147
What'd you think I was talking about?

02:29.333 --> 02:31.324
- Come on, Charles.
- Charles, you coming?

02:31.583 --> 02:33.949
Mr. morse, your assistant
asked me to give you this.

02:34.208 --> 02:35.288
Charles morse?

02:35.750 --> 02:38.457
The billionaire?
My god, is that who you are?

02:39.833 --> 02:40.868
Yeah.

02:44.625 --> 02:46.206
I've taken the Liberty, sir...

02:46.458 --> 02:48.178
Of talking to the pilot
of the amphibian.

02:48.417 --> 02:53.161
I've checked the engine log.
Plane seems to be in good shape.

02:53.417 --> 02:57.330
I would not advise you to fly under
any low ceiling, bird strike, or ice.

02:57.583 --> 03:00.325
- What's bird strike?
- Flocks of birds. Hit, we're dead.

03:00.583 --> 03:02.744
Yes, especially this time of year.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.662
Any questions,
I'll fly you in and out myself.

03:05.917 --> 03:08.989
- We'll be fine.
- I told you you'd have a good time.

03:09.250 --> 03:11.161
- When will you require a plane back?
- Bob?

03:11.417 --> 03:14.830
They want the film in New York,
36 hours. I'd say 8 tomorrow night.

03:15.250 --> 03:16.250
8:00 tomorrow night.

03:16.500 --> 03:18.365
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

03:50.750 --> 03:52.115
Can't handle northern weather?

03:52.417 --> 03:53.577
I'll be all right.

03:56.083 --> 03:57.619
Is that a new watch?

03:58.583 --> 04:01.655
Yeah. Dual time zone.
Tells the time in two places.

04:02.167 --> 04:03.373
What for?

04:03.833 --> 04:08.247
If I'm in L.A. and want the time
in New York, I don't have to add 3.

06:00.917 --> 06:03.533
You built this place by yourself.

06:03.792 --> 06:06.659
Yes, ma'am.
Been building it all my life.

06:11.083 --> 06:13.825
Okay, right this way, folks.

06:14.958 --> 06:18.576
You don't have to worry about keys,
because we got no locks.

06:18.833 --> 06:22.121
Kitchen is always open.
You can fix whatever you like.

06:22.375 --> 06:25.617
The bedrooms and outhouses
are upstairs.

06:25.875 --> 06:27.957
We want you to relax,
kick off your shoes...

06:28.208 --> 06:31.120
And just get down-home comfortable.

06:32.083 --> 06:33.448
Hey, Stephen.

06:34.167 --> 06:35.407
This is what I'm talking about.

06:35.708 --> 06:38.370
See? That's what I want for tomorrow.

06:39.167 --> 06:40.407
An unsentimental photograph.

06:40.667 --> 06:42.953
To get a truly
unselfconscious photograph...

06:43.208 --> 06:45.745
You have to go back
to the 19th century.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.206
How old is that?

06:47.458 --> 06:48.789
Took it last fall.

06:49.292 --> 06:51.658
That's Jack hawk. A friend of mine.

06:52.750 --> 06:53.910
You took the photo?

06:54.167 --> 06:57.534
I took the photo. He took the bear.

06:57.792 --> 07:00.158
I'd be hunting with him now,
you weren't here...

07:01.042 --> 07:03.158
And I had my rifle sighted in.

07:03.417 --> 07:05.157
You interested in books?

07:06.292 --> 07:07.953
Yeah. Why can't you?

07:08.208 --> 07:09.448
What?

07:09.750 --> 07:12.207
Why can't you get your rifle
sighted in?

07:12.458 --> 07:14.540
I need to rig up a bench rest.

07:15.292 --> 07:17.453
An ironing board
makes a good bench rest.

07:17.708 --> 07:19.699
No disrespect...

07:20.500 --> 07:22.786
I'm surprised you know
what a bench rest is.

07:23.042 --> 07:26.910
Charles knows what everything is.
Got a question, ask him.

07:27.500 --> 07:30.458
Take a mighty accomplished man
to claim that.

07:30.750 --> 07:32.490
I don't claim anything.

07:32.750 --> 07:34.160
Ask him. See if I'm wrong.

07:34.583 --> 07:36.073
Bet you can't stump him.

07:36.333 --> 07:37.698
Bet you I can.

07:40.167 --> 07:41.907
I'll tell you what...

07:43.083 --> 07:45.870
I will give you $5...

07:46.333 --> 07:49.780
You can tell me what's on
the other side of this blade.

07:53.417 --> 07:55.282
It's a rabbit smoking a pipe.

07:59.167 --> 08:01.203
A rabbit smoking a pipe.

08:01.458 --> 08:04.370
Why in the world would
that be, Charles?

08:06.167 --> 08:10.615
It's a symbol of the cree Indians.
On one side, there's a panther...

08:10.875 --> 08:13.366
On the other, his prey, the rabbit.

08:13.625 --> 08:15.081
He sits...

08:15.333 --> 08:16.333
Unafraid.

08:16.583 --> 08:17.868
He smokes his pipe.

08:18.583 --> 08:20.323
It's a traditional motif.

08:20.958 --> 08:22.994
Why is he unafraid?

08:24.125 --> 08:26.241
Because he's smarter than the panther.

08:27.292 --> 08:28.327
Sir...

08:29.542 --> 08:31.328
You impress me.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
Thank you.

08:34.167 --> 08:35.657
Amazing accomplishment.

08:36.167 --> 08:38.828
No, it's not an accomplishment.

08:39.125 --> 08:40.740
- It's a freak.
- Is that so?

08:42.417 --> 08:43.417
Yeah.

08:45.042 --> 08:46.828
I seem to retain all these facts...

08:47.083 --> 08:50.155
But putting them to any useful
purpose is another matter.

08:53.083 --> 08:54.914
Hey, listen up, folks.

08:55.167 --> 08:57.749
We got a problem with bears
around here.

08:58.000 --> 09:02.539
Now, never leave food uncovered,
even in the lodge.

09:02.792 --> 09:03.827
Never!

09:04.083 --> 09:06.165
You see a bear near you...

09:06.417 --> 09:08.328
Stand still.

09:09.250 --> 09:13.448
Let him know that you know
that he sees you.

09:14.917 --> 09:16.873
Then back up...

09:17.708 --> 09:19.949
Real slow.

09:21.458 --> 09:23.198
Anybody's in trouble...

09:23.458 --> 09:25.164
Get my attention.

09:25.417 --> 09:27.908
I'll be on it like a duck
on a June bug.

09:28.167 --> 09:30.453
Now make yourselves comfortable.

09:30.708 --> 09:32.824
On that note, I'm going to bed.

09:34.208 --> 09:35.698
Shut up.

09:57.333 --> 09:59.449
Lord, I'm bushed.

10:00.375 --> 10:01.455
New book?

10:02.500 --> 10:04.832
It's about surviving
in the wilderness.

10:05.083 --> 10:07.165
You're always reading something.

10:07.542 --> 10:10.124
My secretary gave it to me.
Do you know why?

10:12.833 --> 10:14.573
Do you know why she gave me the book?

10:14.875 --> 10:17.036
That guy gave me the creeps,
with all that...

10:18.000 --> 10:19.786
Lwlalk about the bear.

10:21.500 --> 10:23.036
Why she gave you the book?

10:23.417 --> 10:24.953
You're the salt of the earth.

10:25.208 --> 10:26.414
Is that so?

10:27.042 --> 10:28.873
You're a most excellent man.

10:29.167 --> 10:30.782
That's why I married you.

10:32.375 --> 10:34.616
You're the only woman
I've ever wanted.

10:36.167 --> 10:38.499
Then see what a lucky guy you are?

10:38.750 --> 10:39.865
Yes, I do.

10:49.333 --> 10:51.995
This is a special day for me.
You know that?

10:52.583 --> 10:53.698
I know it is.

10:54.500 --> 10:57.037
I'm really glad you came away with us.

10:57.458 --> 10:59.244
You got to get away more often.

11:07.292 --> 11:09.408
Can you go and get me a sandwich?

11:11.167 --> 11:12.373
Of course.

11:15.042 --> 11:16.873
Did I ever tell you you're an angel?

11:17.125 --> 11:18.125
No.

11:18.833 --> 11:20.789
Everything but the wings.

11:23.542 --> 11:24.952
The sandwich.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.035
Surprise!

13:48.042 --> 13:51.079
Oh, my god.
Charles, are you all right?

13:51.333 --> 13:53.699
Charles, are you all right?

13:54.375 --> 13:55.865
Jesus! I'm sorry!

13:56.833 --> 13:58.619
I'm so sorry.

13:59.750 --> 14:00.910
Are you all right?

14:01.250 --> 14:02.456
I'm fine.

14:03.750 --> 14:04.990
Are you sure?

14:09.583 --> 14:12.370
- Happy birthday.
- So you didn't forget.

14:13.250 --> 14:14.706
I could never forget you.

14:17.208 --> 14:18.789
I could never forget.

14:23.958 --> 14:25.243
Champagne for Charles.

14:28.417 --> 14:30.203
Blow out the candle, Charles.

14:34.292 --> 14:36.499
May I have your attention, please?

14:36.750 --> 14:39.708
Can I get serious for a moment?
Charles...

14:40.417 --> 14:41.782
Thank you for your...

14:42.417 --> 14:43.657
Good nature...

14:43.917 --> 14:45.123
Your intelligence...

14:46.000 --> 14:47.581
Your generosity...

14:48.833 --> 14:51.950
Forgive us for this charade.

14:52.500 --> 14:54.707
And, in short, happy birthday.

14:54.958 --> 14:56.289
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

14:57.958 --> 15:00.199
To a good companion and a good sport.

15:00.667 --> 15:02.203
And a very brave man.

15:02.458 --> 15:03.458
Hear, hear.

15:03.500 --> 15:04.500
Here.

15:04.750 --> 15:05.750
Thank you.

15:13.750 --> 15:15.661
Mickey, that's beautiful!

15:16.250 --> 15:17.956
There's an engraving inside.

15:18.875 --> 15:20.035
What's it say?

15:21.083 --> 15:23.369
It says, " to my beloved husband...

15:24.333 --> 15:25.618
On his birthday...

15:27.167 --> 15:28.807
From the luckiest woman
in the world."

15:29.417 --> 15:31.328
This is a superb present. Thanks.

15:31.583 --> 15:33.824
May you wear it in good health.

15:35.833 --> 15:37.118
Here you go.

15:38.042 --> 15:39.782
Here you go, birthday boy.

15:41.833 --> 15:42.833
Thank you.

15:52.250 --> 15:53.250
What is it?

15:54.292 --> 15:57.784
- Look at that! Nice, I like that.
- It's beautiful.

15:58.292 --> 16:00.829
You got to give the donor a coin.

16:01.250 --> 16:02.615
Old superstition.

16:03.167 --> 16:04.782
Yes. Thank you. Here.

16:05.042 --> 16:06.373
Give him a coin?

16:06.875 --> 16:10.322
If someone gives you a knife you
should give him a coin in return...

16:10.583 --> 16:12.164
Or it cuts the friendship.

16:13.042 --> 16:14.248
Thank you, Bob.

16:16.833 --> 16:18.118
Getting late. Work day tomorrow.

16:18.375 --> 16:20.331
- Let's pack it in.
- Yeah, to bed!

16:20.583 --> 16:21.583
Happy birthday.

16:21.667 --> 16:22.667
Happy birthday.

16:23.208 --> 16:24.618
Thanks. Thank you.

16:24.875 --> 16:25.875
Good night.

16:26.458 --> 16:28.915
- Happy birthday, Charles.
- Sleep well.

16:29.167 --> 16:31.123
- Happy birthday to you.
- Thank you.

16:34.250 --> 16:35.990
Nice looking lady.

16:36.667 --> 16:38.032
Your wife?

16:39.417 --> 16:40.417
Yes.

16:41.250 --> 16:42.410
Why do you ask?

16:46.375 --> 16:48.286
Just like to know who everybody is.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.115
Hold on, it's flaring.

16:54.375 --> 16:55.490
Got itl

16:55.750 --> 16:57.456
and, let's go.

16:59.833 --> 17:01.869
Redlly beautiful. Great!

17:03.208 --> 17:04.823
That's great!

17:06.041 --> 17:07.623
- Could you lift that up?
- My god.

17:08.041 --> 17:09.373
Give me the 180.

17:09.833 --> 17:11.164
Excuse me.

17:13.833 --> 17:15.789
Okay, great. One more, let's go.

17:16.916 --> 17:18.531
We'll do one more roll. One more.

17:19.541 --> 17:20.577
Officer.

17:21.083 --> 17:23.665
Can I sunbathe on this beach nude?

17:23.916 --> 17:25.498
Sorry, it's against the rules.

17:25.750 --> 17:27.240
But I have a divine right.

17:27.500 --> 17:28.785
Your left ain't bad either.

17:29.875 --> 17:31.490
Let's go. Check it, please.

17:40.417 --> 17:41.953
Kodiak bear.

17:42.458 --> 17:44.665
He'll kill you as he'll look at you.

17:48.792 --> 17:53.206
And the ones that killed a man,
manhunter for the rest of his life.

17:53.458 --> 17:56.495
Nothing he'd rather eat.
Got the taste of human flesh.

17:56.750 --> 17:58.786
A man-killing machine.

17:59.542 --> 18:01.828
Let's get the boy's shoes polished.

18:02.083 --> 18:05.746
- Do I need to walk you through this?
- It's just the shoes.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.332
Scrap the shoes for god's sake.

18:08.583 --> 18:12.201
What is this? Brain surgery?
It's a fucking pair of shoes!

18:12.458 --> 18:15.120
- Let's get James down here.
- Robert, he's sick.

18:17.042 --> 18:20.034
He's sick, the shoes look like shit
and things I ask...

18:20.292 --> 18:22.408
This is really fucking lame.

18:22.667 --> 18:25.283
The inside of a banana peel
will shine shoes.

18:29.542 --> 18:30.542
Come with me.

18:30.750 --> 18:34.197
A fount of information. A banana.
You should know that!

18:37.708 --> 18:39.949
He's sick, Bob. James is sick.

18:40.500 --> 18:42.240
How sick is he?

18:42.500 --> 18:44.536
He'd have to get better to die.

18:51.208 --> 18:52.208
That guy!

18:53.458 --> 18:55.824
That guy.
He's the guy for my photograph.

18:57.250 --> 18:58.865
Excuse me, where is this guy?

18:59.125 --> 19:01.286
He's your friend, right? Where is he?

19:01.542 --> 19:04.909
This is the guy we want.
Not some fucking model.

19:05.167 --> 19:06.167
Where is he?

19:06.333 --> 19:09.200
Jack hawk? Cabin up north. 80 miles.

19:09.667 --> 19:11.498
Does he have a phone?

19:11.750 --> 19:15.447
No phone. No radio.
Any case, he'll likely be out hunting

19:16.292 --> 19:19.250
then we'll just go and find him.
That's what we'll do.

19:24.458 --> 19:26.824
You can make a compass
out of a needle.

19:27.083 --> 19:28.198
God.

19:28.458 --> 19:30.949
That's da new one on me.

19:33.208 --> 19:35.039
Do you spend much time in the woods?

19:35.958 --> 19:38.950
No. I'm afraid most
of my knowledge is theoretical.

19:40.708 --> 19:42.164
Such a...

19:42.625 --> 19:44.161
Perfect spot.

19:45.042 --> 19:47.078
Such a privilege.

19:47.875 --> 19:49.615
It's a shame...

19:49.958 --> 19:52.165
Everyone can't enjoy it.

19:54.708 --> 19:56.073
It is remote and...

19:56.333 --> 19:57.333
True.

19:57.458 --> 20:01.371
You think this spot is so remote
that only the few can enjoy it.

20:01.625 --> 20:03.161
But I got a plan.

20:03.417 --> 20:08.081
I got a scheme to develop this lake
and I think you could appreciate it.

20:08.333 --> 20:10.949
No need for you
to look at these things.

20:11.208 --> 20:13.950
You can envision this
better than these folks can draw.

20:14.667 --> 20:17.249
But I want you to look
at these things.

20:17.500 --> 20:20.242
Now here's the interesting part.

20:20.500 --> 20:25.164
For only 30 or 40 million dollars
you can...

20:27.417 --> 20:28.577
I beg your pardon?

20:30.917 --> 20:34.080
I thought for a moment
you were just being courteous.

20:36.375 --> 20:37.581
What do you mean?

20:38.042 --> 20:39.998
Nothing. It's fine.

20:41.417 --> 20:44.454
- Just leave it fo me.
- Let's get him. We lose the light...

20:44.708 --> 20:46.073
We lose the light at 4:18.

20:46.333 --> 20:50.997
This is the guy we should've shot all
along. He has character in his face.

20:54.708 --> 20:55.708
What's the matter?

20:55.958 --> 20:56.958
What?

20:58.042 --> 20:59.452
It's nothing.

21:00.125 --> 21:01.990
He's jaded, that's what it is.

21:02.917 --> 21:04.123
That's it. I'm jaded.

21:04.375 --> 21:07.538
We're going on an impromptu adventure.
You come too.

21:07.792 --> 21:09.282
Charles on an adventure?

21:09.542 --> 21:13.114
That's right. What do you say,
Charles? We'll be back in 2 hours.

21:13.625 --> 21:15.832
Go. Get some air under your wings.

21:29.042 --> 21:30.248
Yeah. Okay.

21:31.708 --> 21:33.494
Behold the mighty hunter. Come on.

22:48.208 --> 22:49.948
Hello!

23:01.875 --> 23:03.615
That's just great.

23:07.792 --> 23:10.078
My model's gone bear hunting.

23:10.833 --> 23:11.833
How butch of him.

23:12.042 --> 23:13.248
Where's he going?

23:13.542 --> 23:14.542
Big bass lake?

23:15.458 --> 23:17.870
It's about 20 miles northwest!

23:18.250 --> 23:21.037
And we're left here taking
a picture of sweet Fanny Anne.

23:21.292 --> 23:22.327
What do you say?

23:22.583 --> 23:23.583
Whai?!

23:28.875 --> 23:30.411
- Should we chance it?
- Be careful.

23:30.667 --> 23:31.702
Careful of what?

23:31.958 --> 23:33.118
It's a deadfall.

23:33.583 --> 23:34.583
What's a deadfall?

23:34.750 --> 23:37.207
- I's a pit to catch bears.
- What're we being careful of?

23:37.792 --> 23:40.955
It's a pit. They cover it up.
Should we press on?

23:41.208 --> 23:43.915
- Should we be bold?
- You really need to find this guy?

23:44.167 --> 23:46.624
I need to get that film.
A good plan today is...

23:46.875 --> 23:49.708
Better than a perfect plan tomorrow.
What do you say?

23:49.958 --> 23:51.539
Okay, let's be bold.

23:52.125 --> 23:54.832
There's the spirit
that beat the Japanese.

24:14.458 --> 24:17.370
Weather coming in from the north.
Snow, maybe.

24:25.208 --> 24:26.948
Can I tell you something?

24:27.792 --> 24:29.032
If you like.

24:30.458 --> 24:32.198
I admire the way you took that joke.

24:33.125 --> 24:34.490
Handled well.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.082
Embarrassing. You handled it well.

24:37.333 --> 24:38.333
Thank you.

24:40.250 --> 24:42.081
Tough row to hoe
if you think about it.

24:42.333 --> 24:43.618
What would that be?

24:44.625 --> 24:45.831
All that money.

24:47.375 --> 24:49.536
All the responsibility.

24:49.958 --> 24:52.995
Never knowing who your friends are.
Never knowing...

24:53.458 --> 24:55.949
What people value you for.

24:57.917 --> 24:59.157
It must be tough.

25:02.458 --> 25:04.870
Never feel sorry for a man
who owns a plane.

25:08.792 --> 25:10.657
What do you value me for, Bob?

25:13.583 --> 25:15.995
I'll tell you what,
I like your style...

25:17.000 --> 25:19.241
And I think your wife's cute too.

25:19.625 --> 25:20.865
Yes.

25:21.792 --> 25:22.872
So...

25:23.792 --> 25:25.578
How are you planning to kill me?

25:28.625 --> 25:29.625
Fuck! Hold on!

25:35.667 --> 25:36.667
What's happening?

26:04.042 --> 26:05.623
Goddamn if!

28:12.750 --> 28:13.750
Get him up.

28:13.958 --> 28:16.495
Get him up. Let's get him up.
Come on.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
I got him.

28:32.750 --> 28:34.160
Oh, god.

28:42.625 --> 28:44.331
Anyone got any matches?

28:45.708 --> 28:47.039
Any matches?

28:47.417 --> 28:48.623
Help me up.

28:58.292 --> 28:59.623
Oh, my god.

29:13.250 --> 29:15.616
We'll make a fire. Right here.

29:15.875 --> 29:16.990
Make a fire.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.000
That's better.

29:32.375 --> 29:33.375
Come on.

29:34.167 --> 29:35.577
Oh, god.

29:38.792 --> 29:39.907
Come on.

29:44.708 --> 29:45.708
That's it.

29:46.042 --> 29:47.623
Oh, god, no.

29:48.667 --> 29:49.667
Damn.

29:50.958 --> 29:51.958
I'm cold.

29:52.208 --> 29:55.655
Let's stop fucking about, shall we,
and get the guy warm.

29:55.917 --> 29:58.124
Hey, come on. We need those.

29:58.458 --> 29:59.664
We need them.

30:04.875 --> 30:07.992
Come, Stephen, be near the fire.
Come on, come here.

30:32.125 --> 30:34.116
I'm afraid I let the fire burn out.

30:34.375 --> 30:36.081
We only got a few flares left.

30:36.750 --> 30:38.832
Shouldn't we keep them for signaling?

30:41.375 --> 30:42.410
What we need is...

30:44.167 --> 30:47.284
What we want is wood, stacked.
For a signal fire.

30:47.542 --> 30:49.658
So when they come they'll
see the smoke.

30:52.875 --> 30:54.581
Why would they come for us?

30:56.125 --> 30:58.457
They know we went to the cabin.

30:58.708 --> 31:01.245
When they go to the cabin,
they'll see the note.

31:17.500 --> 31:19.456
We're in for a bit of a walk.

31:19.708 --> 31:22.415
What does that mean,
"we're in for a bit of a walk"?

31:27.000 --> 31:29.332
What the fuck does that mean?! What?!

31:31.667 --> 31:33.203
I once read an interesting book.

31:33.458 --> 31:37.155
It said that most people lost
in the wilds...

31:38.000 --> 31:39.581
They die of shame.

31:39.875 --> 31:40.875
What?

31:44.792 --> 31:46.498
They die of shame.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.332
"What did I do?
How did I get into this?"

31:49.583 --> 31:52.325
And so they sit there and they...

31:53.292 --> 31:54.407
Die.

31:55.125 --> 31:58.492
Because they didn't do the one thing
which would've saved their lives.

31:58.750 --> 32:00.240
And what is that, Charles?

32:01.708 --> 32:02.948
Thinking.

32:04.583 --> 32:05.583
Look.

32:05.708 --> 32:06.914
Steve, look.

32:09.708 --> 32:12.074
All right, here's the lodge.

32:12.708 --> 32:15.165
Here's the hunter's cabin.

32:15.417 --> 32:18.079
This is where we did go,
through this pass...

32:18.333 --> 32:20.619
The mountains, the river.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.207
They'd be looking for us in the south.

32:23.458 --> 32:27.246
If we can get back south
of this pass by tonight...

32:27.625 --> 32:28.625
We can use the flares.

32:28.875 --> 32:30.490
How do we find it in the woods?

32:30.750 --> 32:32.035
Head south.

32:33.583 --> 32:36.120
Then we head south.
Which way is south?

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
Look.

32:43.042 --> 32:45.784
Point the hour hand at the sun...

32:46.042 --> 32:47.962
Halfway between the hour hand
and 12 is south.

32:48.167 --> 32:50.158
This is broken. Give me your watch.

32:50.417 --> 32:51.497
Give me your watch.

32:52.167 --> 32:53.828
Mine's busted too.

32:57.958 --> 32:59.289
It's lost.

33:01.250 --> 33:05.619
I'll tell you. The birds will be
flying south. We'll follow them.

33:05.875 --> 33:08.708
- What if we can't see the birds?
- I'm sorry I got us into this.

33:08.958 --> 33:10.789
Stop that! Stop it!

33:13.042 --> 33:14.282
Just stop it!

33:16.333 --> 33:17.333
Where're you going?

33:17.542 --> 33:19.157
Going to make a compass.

33:25.875 --> 33:27.661
All right, you take a needle...

33:28.375 --> 33:29.740
Rub it on silk...

33:30.208 --> 33:31.618
Magnetize it...

33:32.208 --> 33:33.539
And...

33:34.833 --> 33:37.245
Place it on a leaf. Here.

33:39.292 --> 33:40.657
You have a compass.

33:41.458 --> 33:43.494
A needle? Who travels with a needle?

33:49.500 --> 33:50.500
Here.

34:10.542 --> 34:11.542
Shit!

34:16.417 --> 34:17.657
See, it works.

34:19.292 --> 34:20.532
It works.

34:22.500 --> 34:23.831
That peak is south.

34:25.208 --> 34:26.493
What if it isn't?

34:26.750 --> 34:29.116
It is.
It's drawn by the earth's magnetism.

34:29.375 --> 34:31.114
I know how a compass works.

34:31.375 --> 34:32.911
Good, then you know...

34:33.167 --> 34:34.407
1hat's south.

34:34.708 --> 34:36.447
What do we do when
we get to that peak?

34:36.708 --> 34:38.072
We take another sighting.

34:43.875 --> 34:46.536
That doesn't feel south, Charles.

34:46.917 --> 34:50.989
Just because you're lost doesn't mean
your compass is broken. It's south.

34:56.000 --> 34:57.000
Come on.

35:22.625 --> 35:26.243
You know the vikings would steer
their ship with a rope.

35:26.500 --> 35:28.240
How did they do that?

35:28.500 --> 35:33.369
They'd have two set points on the land
they'd left behind or sailed from.

35:33.792 --> 35:36.909
And they'd line them up
and that would be their bearing.

35:37.167 --> 35:41.581
And then they'd trail this
long rope behind their ship...

35:41.833 --> 35:44.996
Pointing it at those
two points there...

35:46.083 --> 35:48.415
- Might want to conserve your breath.
- Say what?

36:03.583 --> 36:05.244
We must get through by nightfall.

36:07.625 --> 36:08.625
Come on.

36:10.083 --> 36:12.745
What are the odds that
they'll see the flares?

36:13.625 --> 36:14.990
Damn fine. Damn fine.

36:16.250 --> 36:17.535
You think so?

36:18.333 --> 36:21.450
I don't know if I think so or not,
but I have to say so.

36:22.625 --> 36:23.910
City boy.

36:35.458 --> 36:38.700
Is it my diseased imagination
or did you say:

36:39.000 --> 36:40.991
"How were you planning to kill me?"

36:42.458 --> 36:43.698
Did you say that?

36:43.958 --> 36:44.958
Yeah.

36:46.250 --> 36:49.697
What did that mean?
Why would I want to kill you, Charles?

36:51.000 --> 36:52.331
For my wife.

36:53.792 --> 36:54.827
For Mickey?

36:55.083 --> 36:56.083
Yeah.

36:56.750 --> 37:00.368
That's bizarre. I want to kill you
to get next to your wife.

37:01.208 --> 37:02.744
I've seen you with her.

37:08.375 --> 37:09.831
We work together.

37:12.625 --> 37:14.365
I've seen the way you are.

37:14.625 --> 37:16.991
No offense, but I get my own girl...

37:17.667 --> 37:19.703
If you noticed, while we've
known each other.

37:19.958 --> 37:23.246
You're a powerful guy.
Why would I antagonize you?

37:23.500 --> 37:25.081
Why would I want to do that?

37:26.375 --> 37:27.660
To get the money.

37:32.083 --> 37:33.118
The money.

37:34.458 --> 37:37.655
Now it's the broad, now it's
the boodle and nothing is safe.

37:40.042 --> 37:41.532
Rich man.

37:42.208 --> 37:46.702
All they want is to take something
from you. Badly enough to kill you.

37:52.375 --> 37:54.036
You know something, Charles?

37:54.708 --> 37:56.323
The rich are different.

38:18.333 --> 38:20.289
Charles, how far do you think it is?

38:20.708 --> 38:22.744
It can't be more than about 10 miles.

38:23.250 --> 38:24.786
- Shit.
- What?

38:25.042 --> 38:27.078
Got a stitch in my side.

38:27.333 --> 38:28.914
Find a round stone.

38:29.417 --> 38:31.248
Find a round stone. Spit under it.

38:31.500 --> 38:32.831
An old Indian remedy?

38:33.083 --> 38:34.619
Yeah, that's right.

38:36.125 --> 38:37.740
You think I'm a fool, don't you?

38:38.750 --> 38:41.537
A fool? No.
Old Indian remedy makes sense.

38:41.792 --> 38:45.455
Fellow's got a stitch, make him
slow down, take his mind off it.

38:45.708 --> 38:47.323
Make him stretch, bend over.

38:47.583 --> 38:49.574
No, because of what I said.

38:49.833 --> 38:51.494
- About what?
- About my wife.

38:51.750 --> 38:54.287
What you said about your wife.
Well...

38:54.542 --> 38:59.411
What I think, I think you got
a whole stew of too much money...

38:59.708 --> 39:00.914
Latent homosexuality...

39:01.167 --> 39:03.374
Lots of other good stuff. Paranoia.

39:03.625 --> 39:06.867
We'll all get together when
we get back, you and me...

39:07.125 --> 39:10.492
And your wife, and we'll get
into a hot tub and...

39:12.250 --> 39:14.491
Bare our feelings and...

39:18.125 --> 39:20.992
Even if I wanted to kill you,
I need you to get home.

39:21.375 --> 39:22.865
You fucking idiot.

39:24.042 --> 39:26.283
Needing people. Isn't it a bitch?

39:26.542 --> 39:28.182
- Who're we talking about?
- Fanny farmer.

39:28.750 --> 39:30.706
The mother of level measurement.

39:31.125 --> 39:32.661
It's good to know you have a hero.

39:33.292 --> 39:36.364
Cheering up, are we?
Regaining our feisty demeanor?

39:36.625 --> 39:37.990
It's good of you to notice.

39:38.250 --> 39:40.241
Knows all, tells all. Shall we?

39:40.500 --> 39:41.500
Wait!

39:47.708 --> 39:49.073
Listen, listen.

40:15.667 --> 40:16.667
Come on.

41:00.167 --> 41:01.452
Come onl

41:42.417 --> 41:43.657
We'll never make it.

41:45.500 --> 41:46.785
Pull this tree.

41:48.500 --> 41:49.500
Pulll

41:50.167 --> 41:51.247
Steve, go!

41:51.500 --> 41:53.115
Pull! Count of 3!

41:58.625 --> 41:59.990
Come on! One...

42:00.250 --> 42:02.582
Lwo, three, go!

42:48.000 --> 42:49.240
Come onl

42:59.042 --> 43:00.042
Easy.

43:06.333 --> 43:07.539
Charles, go!

43:11.750 --> 43:13.786
Take it easy, Charles!

43:14.042 --> 43:15.327
Look out!

43:16.833 --> 43:17.948
It's okay.

43:18.333 --> 43:19.664
You got it! Come on!

43:19.917 --> 43:21.032
Keep coming!

43:21.292 --> 43:24.284
- Come on, Charles, come on!
- Just keep coming!

43:28.125 --> 43:29.125
Keep coming!

43:38.458 --> 43:40.915
Jesus! Charles, hang on!

43:44.708 --> 43:45.788
Hold on!

44:21.292 --> 44:22.623
You okay?

44:28.625 --> 44:29.910
Come on! Let's go!

44:52.458 --> 44:53.789
Oh, god!

44:57.833 --> 44:59.448
I lost the flares.

45:00.417 --> 45:01.873
We'll get by without them.

45:02.125 --> 45:03.125
How?

45:04.167 --> 45:05.452
I've got...

45:07.250 --> 45:08.911
Sixx matches left.

45:10.167 --> 45:11.873
We'll make a signal fire.

45:13.125 --> 45:16.947
We'll make a signal fire. We'll use
a match. The plane will see us.

45:18.000 --> 45:20.616
- Snap out of it!
- I's going to be fine.

45:20.875 --> 45:23.412
It's going to be fine.
Which way is it?

45:23.667 --> 45:24.873
It's up there.

45:25.167 --> 45:27.078
- Come on.
- Let's go, Charles.

45:28.500 --> 45:29.660
You okay?

45:31.083 --> 45:32.368
You saved me.

45:33.583 --> 45:36.245
- I need you to navigate.
- You saved my life.

45:36.500 --> 45:39.572
I couldn't kill you then.
I'd have to kill Stephen too.

45:39.833 --> 45:41.118
He knows how I like my coffee.

45:41.375 --> 45:42.706
You saved my life.

45:42.958 --> 45:44.619
Buy me something when we get home.

45:44.875 --> 45:46.331
How do you like your coffee?

45:46.625 --> 45:48.081
Like I like my women.

45:49.000 --> 45:50.206
Bitter and murky.

45:59.583 --> 46:01.619
I lost the bloody flares.

46:02.667 --> 46:04.874
You told me why people
die in the woods.

46:05.125 --> 46:06.331
Yeah, they die of shame.

46:06.583 --> 46:08.119
Take a lesson from it.

46:08.375 --> 46:11.412
You want to get up.
Top of that rise. High as possible.

46:11.667 --> 46:13.203
Let the plane see the fire.

46:17.958 --> 46:20.540
Why do we think they'll
come looking for us?

46:20.833 --> 46:24.280
He's a billionaire. You know what
happens when you misplace one.

46:24.833 --> 46:27.245
Going to make some story
to tell when we get home.

46:28.583 --> 46:32.405
Quite a change from, " that cab driver
was so rude to Mel"

46:50.833 --> 46:52.289
You see anything?

46:53.458 --> 46:54.458
No.

47:42.125 --> 47:43.410
Come on, let's go.

48:31.458 --> 48:32.868
My, god!

48:44.083 --> 48:45.823
Shit!

48:46.833 --> 48:48.369
Okay, let's see.

48:53.667 --> 48:56.158
Maybe it was the buckle
that threw it off.

49:03.500 --> 49:06.116
What are we going to do?

49:06.375 --> 49:07.375
It's all right.

49:07.625 --> 49:09.411
- We're going to die!
- Look here!

49:09.667 --> 49:12.909
We don't know what the hell
we're doing here!

49:13.167 --> 49:15.624
What are we gonna do?!
We're going to die!

49:15.875 --> 49:18.617
Nobody knows where we are!
We got nothing to eat!

49:21.208 --> 49:23.449
All right, Steve. Look.

49:24.125 --> 49:25.240
Look here.

49:26.000 --> 49:27.706
This is what we're gonna do.

49:29.375 --> 49:30.581
You see this?

49:31.375 --> 49:33.457
Going to make a spear, all right?

49:36.167 --> 49:37.907
You want me to make a spear?!

49:39.583 --> 49:41.949
We need you to make one for fishing.

49:42.208 --> 49:43.288
Go on, take it.

49:44.417 --> 49:45.577
Good. Fine.

49:46.042 --> 49:47.703
You can do that.

49:49.583 --> 49:51.448
They'll never find us.

49:53.000 --> 49:56.618
They will find us. And even if
they don't, we'll walk out of here.

49:56.875 --> 49:58.661
You do as I say now, okay?

49:59.333 --> 50:00.789
I'l make a fire.

50:01.250 --> 50:02.490
Get on with if!

50:03.792 --> 50:05.123
It's going to be okay.

50:11.917 --> 50:14.374
What is he gonna do, make a spear?

50:15.500 --> 50:17.832
Is he going to fish for our dinner?

50:18.083 --> 50:20.199
I wanted to give him something to do.

50:20.833 --> 50:24.280
Are they gonna come for us?
You are an important guy, right?

50:24.542 --> 50:25.542
Right?

50:26.708 --> 50:28.539
Lookit, I'm talking to you!

50:30.125 --> 50:31.615
What would you like to do?

50:32.417 --> 50:34.203
Should we lay down and die?

50:36.125 --> 50:38.116
Do we lay down and die, Bob?

50:42.625 --> 50:44.741
There's nobody here but us.

50:46.167 --> 50:47.782
Have I missed something?

50:51.958 --> 50:52.958
You're right.

50:53.792 --> 50:55.123
You're right, I'm sorry.

51:00.750 --> 51:02.081
Shit!

51:03.042 --> 51:04.122
Shit!

51:04.667 --> 51:06.703
All right, give me your hands.

51:08.167 --> 51:09.327
God!

51:10.000 --> 51:12.241
- Take your hands away.
- What have I done?

51:12.500 --> 51:13.990
What have I done?

51:16.792 --> 51:17.792
Jesus.

51:18.042 --> 51:19.042
It's deep.

51:19.500 --> 51:21.081
I'm not going to lose my leg?

51:21.333 --> 51:22.333
You'll be all right.

51:24.250 --> 51:25.330
Press down.

51:25.583 --> 51:26.583
Put your hands there.

51:26.833 --> 51:27.833
Keep them there.

51:31.583 --> 51:33.995
I'll pull this as tight
as you can take it.

51:44.625 --> 51:45.625
Bury this.

51:47.583 --> 51:49.323
Start building the fire.

51:52.042 --> 51:53.532
You're going to be all right.

51:54.250 --> 51:57.322
- Is that all right? Not too tight?
- No, it's just great.

51:57.667 --> 51:58.782
Good.

52:00.917 --> 52:02.407
It's a clean cut.

52:03.167 --> 52:04.782
I think it bled clean.

52:05.625 --> 52:07.206
If we change the...

52:07.625 --> 52:09.456
Bandages regularly...

52:09.708 --> 52:11.369
It should knit up fine.

52:14.417 --> 52:16.032
Guess I'm no lumberjack.

52:19.208 --> 52:21.119
You're doing fine, Steve.

52:21.375 --> 52:22.535
You'll be fine.

52:22.792 --> 52:24.874
You know something? What?

52:27.000 --> 52:28.206
You're all right.

52:29.833 --> 52:30.833
Am I?

52:32.042 --> 52:33.282
No, I mean it.

52:33.708 --> 52:35.039
Very thoughtful man.

52:35.333 --> 52:36.618
Thank you.

52:37.167 --> 52:38.623
And I appreciate it.

52:39.833 --> 52:41.164
It's my pleasure.

52:42.750 --> 52:44.786
So are we gonna get out of here?

52:46.083 --> 52:47.289
Yes, we are.

52:47.542 --> 52:49.248
How are we gonna get out of here?

52:52.708 --> 52:54.369
You see this...

52:56.333 --> 52:58.119
You see that constellation?

52:59.417 --> 53:00.657
Cassiopeia.

53:00.917 --> 53:01.917
The big w?

53:04.917 --> 53:08.239
The right edge of the w
points to the north star.

53:08.667 --> 53:10.077
North star...

53:10.333 --> 53:11.539
Is north.

53:11.917 --> 53:13.327
Tomorrow we walk...

53:13.583 --> 53:14.823
South to the river.

53:15.083 --> 53:16.914
The river will take us home.

53:17.917 --> 53:20.203
It's gonna work better
than that compass?

53:21.958 --> 53:23.038
Yeah.

53:24.833 --> 53:26.118
I hope so.

53:27.750 --> 53:29.991
Why do people die in the woods?

53:32.250 --> 53:33.865
They die of shame.

53:56.917 --> 53:58.703
It puts things in perspective.

54:00.250 --> 54:01.490
What's that?

54:03.000 --> 54:04.206
Out here.

54:05.542 --> 54:07.624
Different from the fashion world.

54:09.833 --> 54:12.745
Different from snorting coke off
the girls' hip bones.

54:14.042 --> 54:15.202
In what way?

54:30.708 --> 54:32.869
You're starting to loosen up.

54:33.167 --> 54:34.282
You think so?

54:35.625 --> 54:37.115
That's my report.

55:32.750 --> 55:33.910
So...

55:34.750 --> 55:35.750
What?

55:37.667 --> 55:39.407
He's not that badly hurt.

55:40.333 --> 55:43.450
Then what are our chances
when all is said and done?

55:43.708 --> 55:48.156
We can walk out and probably die,
or stay here and he'll certainly die.

55:48.417 --> 55:50.032
I think our chances are good.

55:50.875 --> 55:51.875
Seriously.

55:52.125 --> 55:54.616
Yeah! Better than good.

55:55.000 --> 55:57.787
We know that that's north.
And that's...

56:08.792 --> 56:10.532
I said we had to bury those.

56:11.000 --> 56:12.456
What difference does it make?

56:12.708 --> 56:14.869
- We have to get them down.
- Why?

56:15.167 --> 56:17.909
They put the smell of blood
in the air, that's why.

56:18.417 --> 56:21.329
I'm not going to climb up a tree
in a thunderstorm!

56:21.583 --> 56:22.743
We must get it down!

56:23.000 --> 56:24.536
You climb up the goddamn tree!

56:24.792 --> 56:26.202
Give me a hand.

56:26.833 --> 56:27.948
Oh, shit!

56:28.250 --> 56:29.250
Jesus!

56:38.333 --> 56:39.869
Charles, stay back!

56:49.292 --> 56:50.292
Stay back!

57:03.833 --> 57:05.994
For god's sakes, Charles!

57:07.250 --> 57:08.535
Come on, Charles.

57:26.458 --> 57:27.618
Steve!

57:33.000 --> 57:34.160
Oh, god.

58:02.750 --> 58:04.035
Come onl

58:04.292 --> 58:05.498
come onl

58:54.917 --> 58:57.078
So, we navigate by the stars.

58:57.917 --> 58:59.748
We travel by night if there's a moon.

59:00.417 --> 59:02.749
We can't live out the winter up here.

59:04.792 --> 59:07.158
If we find the river,
it'll take us south.

59:08.333 --> 59:11.200
They won't be looking
for us this far north?

59:12.083 --> 59:13.573
We have to walk out.

59:18.333 --> 59:19.664
What do we eat?

59:21.208 --> 59:22.573
I'm working on it.

01:00:13.667 --> 01:00:15.032
How about that?

01:00:21.167 --> 01:00:22.167
Listen!

01:00:23.208 --> 01:00:24.368
My god!

01:00:37.042 --> 01:00:38.248
Come onl

01:00:39.292 --> 01:00:40.702
come onl

01:00:58.417 --> 01:01:00.078
Wait!

01:01:09.375 --> 01:01:10.865
Wait!

01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:18.286
No! Wait! I

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.331
Oh, god!

01:02:08.958 --> 01:02:11.665
Did you know that you can
make fire from ice?

01:02:15.417 --> 01:02:17.658
You can make fire from ice.

01:02:17.917 --> 01:02:18.917
Hello.

01:02:19.167 --> 01:02:20.407
I'm talking to you.

01:02:23.875 --> 01:02:26.116
Did you know that could be done?

01:02:26.375 --> 01:02:27.490
Can you think?

01:02:32.667 --> 01:02:35.283
You moneyed folk, isn't it?

01:02:37.250 --> 01:02:38.250
Isn't it?!

01:02:38.333 --> 01:02:40.244
Fire from ice, can you think how?

01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:42.081
Sit up there. Drinks and golf.

01:02:42.333 --> 01:02:45.496
Screwing the maid.
But get you in an emergency...

01:02:45.750 --> 01:02:47.160
And you bloom.

01:02:47.875 --> 01:02:49.206
You make me sick!

01:02:49.458 --> 01:02:51.494
- You make me sick!
- I'm sure I do.

01:02:51.875 --> 01:02:56.289
You fucking make me sick! I mean,
what puts you off? Jews and taxes!

01:02:56.708 --> 01:02:58.164
Fire from ice, can you think how?

01:02:58.625 --> 01:03:01.082
I don't want to know how, Charles!

01:03:09.958 --> 01:03:12.074
Do you have anything
you'd like to live for?

01:03:16.042 --> 01:03:17.248
You know something?

01:03:18.333 --> 01:03:19.448
You know something?

01:03:19.708 --> 01:03:22.780
Maybe we were right
to let people like you...

01:03:23.042 --> 01:03:24.452
Run the country all these years.

01:03:24.708 --> 01:03:26.573
You're the only ones dense enough!

01:03:28.042 --> 01:03:30.658
No, I'm not dense.
I just have no imagination.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.080
Making a...

01:03:40.542 --> 01:03:42.123
Decision tree?

01:03:42.375 --> 01:03:44.661
- Is that it?
- That's it, Bob.

01:03:57.750 --> 01:04:00.617
We can't think they'd come back?

01:04:02.292 --> 01:04:03.292
No.

01:04:04.708 --> 01:04:06.494
We shouldn't think they'll come back.

01:04:08.250 --> 01:04:10.662
They've scouted this area.
They'll move on.

01:04:41.125 --> 01:04:42.740
Fire from ice.

01:04:44.792 --> 01:04:45.998
Let's have it.

01:04:47.375 --> 01:04:48.615
Ice.

01:04:48.875 --> 01:04:50.661
You take it into your hands...

01:04:50.917 --> 01:04:53.283
And you mold it into a lens...

01:04:54.042 --> 01:04:57.489
Which will concentrate
sunlight into fire.

01:05:14.667 --> 01:05:17.124
I doubt we'll be reduced
to that because...

01:05:17.375 --> 01:05:21.573
We still have the matches
and I believe that's all we'll need.

01:05:31.583 --> 01:05:32.993
Oh, Jesus.

01:06:37.083 --> 01:06:38.493
There's fish in there.

01:06:40.333 --> 01:06:43.655
What are we gonna use for tackle?
How will we bait them?

01:06:53.208 --> 01:06:54.744
Wouldn't you find that attractive?

01:06:56.542 --> 01:06:57.952
I don't know.

01:06:58.833 --> 01:06:59.913
It's gold.

01:07:00.458 --> 01:07:02.790
The whole world longs for it.

01:07:04.417 --> 01:07:06.703
I'm not in a very humorous mood.

01:07:06.958 --> 01:07:09.244
Come on, don't go native on me, Bob.

01:07:10.958 --> 01:07:14.155
I'm sorry. I'm just tired.
I'm very tired.

01:07:14.417 --> 01:07:16.908
Why don't you rest? Gather some wood.

01:09:25.750 --> 01:09:27.206
He's a man-killer.

01:09:27.457 --> 01:09:30.416
He's been following us
the whole time. Stalking us.

01:09:32.917 --> 01:09:34.122
Come onl

01:10:57.958 --> 01:10:59.619
He's toying with us.

01:11:04.125 --> 01:11:05.911
What are we gonna do?

01:11:08.375 --> 01:11:10.081
What, do I have a plan?

01:11:11.292 --> 01:11:13.123
Am I supposed to have a plan?

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:15.240
You tell me.

01:11:18.042 --> 01:11:19.657
We can't move.

01:11:20.792 --> 01:11:22.282
He won't let us eat.

01:11:25.042 --> 01:11:26.907
We're going to starve up here.

01:11:44.625 --> 01:11:46.456
What are we gonna do?

01:11:51.667 --> 01:11:53.077
We're gonna kill him.

01:13:04.417 --> 01:13:05.953
We get him to attack.

01:13:06.208 --> 01:13:07.664
Spear. Bait.

01:13:07.917 --> 01:13:09.373
Induce a charge.

01:13:09.625 --> 01:13:11.741
Bear charges and rears.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.958
As he falls, he impales
himself on the spear.

01:13:15.875 --> 01:13:17.866
Same principle as the deadfall.

01:13:18.250 --> 01:13:20.457
Use his own weight to kill him.

01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:24.456
What are we gonna use to bait him?

01:13:24.708 --> 01:13:25.914
We lure him.

01:13:26.333 --> 01:13:27.948
- What?
- We lure him!

01:13:29.750 --> 01:13:30.750
You know?

01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:32.910
Masai boys in Africa...

01:13:33.375 --> 01:13:34.785
11 years old...

01:13:35.167 --> 01:13:37.032
They kill lions with Spears.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.161
How do we lure him?

01:13:41.875 --> 01:13:44.036
11 -year-old boys kill a lion.

01:13:44.417 --> 01:13:47.329
Do you know Indian boys used to
run up to the bear and slap him?

01:13:47.625 --> 01:13:49.661
Count coup on him
as a test of manhood.

01:13:50.333 --> 01:13:51.618
No, Charles.

01:13:51.875 --> 01:13:53.206
How will we lure him?

01:13:54.125 --> 01:13:55.160
Blood.

01:13:58.542 --> 01:13:59.622
Blood!

01:14:00.833 --> 01:14:01.833
We must...

01:14:02.292 --> 01:14:03.828
Distract him, of course.

01:14:04.375 --> 01:14:06.240
We must distract him and...

01:14:06.625 --> 01:14:08.456
Lrap him, but it can be done.

01:14:08.875 --> 01:14:09.990
Do you believe it?

01:14:10.875 --> 01:14:11.875
Believe jt?!

01:14:12.417 --> 01:14:13.623
I don't know, Charles.

01:14:13.875 --> 01:14:16.457
I don't think it will work.
=I will work!

01:14:16.958 --> 01:14:18.368
It will work!

01:14:18.708 --> 01:14:20.164
What one man can do, another can.

01:14:20.417 --> 01:14:21.907
We can't kill the bear.

01:14:24.583 --> 01:14:27.290
He's ahead of us!
It's like he's reading our minds.

01:14:27.542 --> 01:14:29.999
He's stalking us, for god's sakes!

01:14:32.792 --> 01:14:34.248
You want to die out here.

01:14:38.167 --> 01:14:39.498
Then die.

01:14:39.875 --> 01:14:41.285
But I tell you what.

01:14:42.333 --> 01:14:44.619
I'm not going to die. No, siree.

01:14:44.875 --> 01:14:46.331
I'm not gonna die.

01:14:47.875 --> 01:14:49.911
No. I'm gonna kill the bear.

01:14:51.875 --> 01:14:53.831
Say it. "I'm going to kill the bear!"

01:14:54.917 --> 01:14:57.579
Say it. "I'm going to kill
the bear. "Say if!

01:14:57.917 --> 01:14:58.997
"I'l kill the bear!"

01:14:59.958 --> 01:15:00.958
Say it!

01:15:02.208 --> 01:15:04.119
- I'll kill the bear.
- Again!

01:15:04.375 --> 01:15:06.115
- I'll kill the bear.
- Again!

01:15:06.375 --> 01:15:07.660
I'm gonna kill the bear!

01:15:07.917 --> 01:15:10.158
What one man can do, another can do!

01:15:10.417 --> 01:15:12.658
What one man can do, another can do.

01:15:14.292 --> 01:15:15.292
Again!

01:15:15.375 --> 01:15:18.162
What one man can do, another can do!

01:15:19.625 --> 01:15:21.240
You're goddamn right.

01:15:23.625 --> 01:15:24.831
Because today...

01:15:25.292 --> 01:15:27.328
I'm gonna kill the motherfucker.

01:18:28.208 --> 01:18:29.493
Come on.

01:18:33.042 --> 01:18:34.042
Now.

01:18:52.625 --> 01:18:53.705
Run! Run!

01:19:11.917 --> 01:19:13.578
Come onl

01:20:01.208 --> 01:20:03.119
Hit him in the neck!

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:10.000
Jesus!

01:20:10.292 --> 01:20:11.577
Jesus!

01:20:26.333 --> 01:20:28.745
Look out! Look out! Look out!

01:20:43.958 --> 01:20:44.958
Come onl

01:21:07.625 --> 01:21:08.625
Come and get me!

01:21:08.958 --> 01:21:11.495
Gel me! Come! Come onl!

01:21:14.625 --> 01:21:15.705
Come onl

01:21:17.583 --> 01:21:19.073
you son of a bitch!

01:21:19.833 --> 01:21:20.993
Come here, motherfucker!

01:21:21.250 --> 01:21:23.241
Come and get me!

01:21:28.167 --> 01:21:29.167
Come onl

01:21:29.417 --> 01:21:30.497
gel Mel

01:21:30.750 --> 01:21:32.286
come on, get Mel!

01:21:33.625 --> 01:21:34.625
Look out!

01:23:39.792 --> 01:23:41.578
Wish we had some salt.

01:23:42.750 --> 01:23:44.331
You know you can...

01:23:45.292 --> 01:23:47.783
You can season meat with gunpowder.

01:23:48.167 --> 01:23:49.247
Did you know that?

01:23:50.625 --> 01:23:52.490
I wish we had some gunpowder.

01:23:56.792 --> 01:23:58.828
I don't suppose you made one for me?

01:23:59.625 --> 01:24:00.625
Yeah.

01:24:10.375 --> 01:24:11.490
What do you think?

01:24:18.625 --> 01:24:20.035
What's the matter, Charles?

01:24:20.542 --> 01:24:21.542
Nothing.

01:24:23.333 --> 01:24:24.493
No, really. What?

01:24:29.625 --> 01:24:32.697
All my life I wanted
to do something that was...

01:24:33.875 --> 01:24:35.615
That was unequivocal.

01:24:38.458 --> 01:24:41.165
Well, Charlie, I certainly
think this qualifies.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:43.080
Yeah, something.

01:24:44.375 --> 01:24:47.082
You see, that's why
they call it " personal growth."

01:24:47.417 --> 01:24:51.239
A month ago, smokey would've reared,
you would've called your lawyer.

01:24:52.583 --> 01:24:53.583
Nah.

01:24:54.208 --> 01:24:55.994
I wouldn't do that to an animal.

01:25:58.542 --> 01:25:59.657
So I said:

01:26:02.542 --> 01:26:04.328
"If this is my life...

01:26:05.042 --> 01:26:06.578
Then this is my life."

01:26:07.417 --> 01:26:09.078
But you can change your life.

01:26:09.958 --> 01:26:11.539
That's what I'm telling you.

01:26:12.750 --> 01:26:13.750
Is that true?

01:26:14.833 --> 01:26:16.494
Why wouldn't it be true?

01:26:17.542 --> 01:26:22.206
Because I never knew anybody
who did actually change their lives.

01:26:26.958 --> 01:26:28.243
I'll tell you what.

01:26:29.958 --> 01:26:32.074
I'm gonna start my life over.

01:26:41.375 --> 01:26:42.911
You'd be the first.

01:28:25.292 --> 01:28:28.125
No one's been here for quite a while.

01:29:00.792 --> 01:29:02.077
What do you make of it?

01:29:02.583 --> 01:29:03.583
If we're here...

01:29:04.583 --> 01:29:05.993
That canoe will take us out.

01:29:06.500 --> 01:29:07.831
You know what we must do?

01:29:08.667 --> 01:29:10.908
Find out if that canoe really floats.

01:29:21.792 --> 01:29:23.282
It floats.

01:29:27.875 --> 01:29:28.990
Cup of tea?

01:29:29.417 --> 01:29:30.417
Yeah.

01:31:08.500 --> 01:31:10.161
You ain't got that fire lit?

01:31:28.250 --> 01:31:30.332
Drinking the other fellow's supplies?

01:31:34.042 --> 01:31:35.157
Get back...

01:31:36.833 --> 01:31:38.073
And send him a check.

01:31:40.958 --> 01:31:42.243
Send him a check.

01:31:53.167 --> 01:31:55.203
Hell of an adventure, eh, Charles?

01:31:55.708 --> 01:31:57.164
Yeah, wasn't it?

01:32:02.833 --> 01:32:03.833
You know...

01:32:07.292 --> 01:32:08.782
I hope to tell you...

01:32:10.792 --> 01:32:12.248
If had my camera here...

01:32:12.500 --> 01:32:14.115
I would've made my fortune.

01:32:16.542 --> 01:32:17.782
Made my fortune.

01:32:29.500 --> 01:32:31.240
That thing's busted to shit.

01:32:31.833 --> 01:32:33.573
It still has some...

01:32:34.167 --> 01:32:35.577
Sentimental value.

01:32:37.042 --> 01:32:38.407
I suppose it does.

01:32:50.292 --> 01:32:51.998
Can I see your watch?

01:32:57.625 --> 01:32:58.625
My watch?

01:33:00.375 --> 01:33:01.831
Doesn't work. Told you.

01:33:02.083 --> 01:33:03.083
Busted.

01:33:04.292 --> 01:33:06.704
Yeah, I know it doesn't work.

01:33:06.958 --> 01:33:08.448
Could I see it?

01:33:10.792 --> 01:33:12.202
New when we left.

01:33:15.042 --> 01:33:16.782
Just a piece of junk now.

01:33:23.208 --> 01:33:24.573
What's the matter, Bob?

01:33:25.292 --> 01:33:26.748
Can't do it sober?

01:33:31.417 --> 01:33:33.453
I suppose you don't need me anymore.

01:33:33.958 --> 01:33:36.495
You can find your own way out
without me.

01:33:37.500 --> 01:33:40.617
You had no business with that broad.
You know you don't.

01:33:45.292 --> 01:33:47.408
You know that you don't, Charles.

01:33:50.917 --> 01:33:52.157
Look at it.

01:33:52.417 --> 01:33:55.534
Why did she go with you?
Why in hell did she go with you?

01:33:55.792 --> 01:33:59.455
Your money. For the love of god,
everyone knew that.

01:34:00.792 --> 01:34:02.077
Are you nuts?

01:34:05.042 --> 01:34:09.490
In the airport with her, people said,
"there goes a guy with a plane."

01:34:14.292 --> 01:34:16.248
There goes a guy with a plane.

01:34:19.792 --> 01:34:22.659
Say it was tough luck.
That's what you drew this time.

01:34:26.292 --> 01:34:27.452
Well...

01:34:29.625 --> 01:34:30.910
That's right.

01:34:40.375 --> 01:34:42.331
"For all the nights."

01:34:43.375 --> 01:34:44.740
How touching.

01:34:45.167 --> 01:34:46.828
Why torture yourself?

01:34:49.875 --> 01:34:51.081
It's over now.

01:35:01.542 --> 01:35:02.998
Let's go outside.

01:35:17.583 --> 01:35:19.369
Just tell me this one thing.

01:35:20.583 --> 01:35:22.244
Was it from the first?

01:35:22.750 --> 01:35:24.160
You and my wife?

01:35:24.833 --> 01:35:26.494
Was it from the first, Bob?

01:35:27.292 --> 01:35:28.407
Come on, Charles.

01:35:30.708 --> 01:35:32.664
Is that an indelicate question?

01:35:33.875 --> 01:35:35.206
Come on, Charles.

01:35:35.500 --> 01:35:36.500
Done is done.

01:35:38.708 --> 01:35:40.244
Well, I'm dying, so...

01:35:40.708 --> 01:35:42.448
What difference does it make?

01:35:44.125 --> 01:35:46.457
Why is that so important to you?

01:35:52.167 --> 01:35:53.577
I love her.

01:35:55.708 --> 01:35:56.743
I'm sorry.

01:35:57.292 --> 01:35:58.372
It's time.

01:35:59.875 --> 01:36:01.285
Don't do it, Bob.

01:36:01.542 --> 01:36:03.783
You live in a dream world.
You always have.

01:36:04.958 --> 01:36:06.368
Now turn your back.

01:36:06.625 --> 01:36:08.581
You don't have to do it.

01:36:08.833 --> 01:36:12.405
The hell I don't! You know that I do.
Now turn your back.

01:36:12.667 --> 01:36:15.033
I don't want to hear any more
of your nonsense.

01:36:15.292 --> 01:36:16.873
I don't want to hear it!

01:36:18.708 --> 01:36:20.824
How close we've become
and this and that.

01:36:21.083 --> 01:36:23.449
You would've died out here,
if not for me.

01:36:23.708 --> 01:36:25.118
With all your wealth.

01:36:26.792 --> 01:36:30.239
You understand me?
I said, turn your goddamn back!

01:36:31.792 --> 01:36:34.374
- Listen to me.
- Don't go any further.

01:36:37.708 --> 01:36:39.073
I said, turn your back.

01:36:42.542 --> 01:36:43.577
No?

01:36:48.167 --> 01:36:49.167
You know...

01:36:49.417 --> 01:36:51.157
Life is a short thing.

01:36:51.417 --> 01:36:52.702
Full of betrayal.

01:36:52.958 --> 01:36:54.744
In many ways, you're well out of it.

01:36:55.708 --> 01:36:56.914
Charles, don't!

01:37:00.375 --> 01:37:02.411
Be careful of the deadfall.

01:37:15.708 --> 01:37:17.744
Oh, god, Charles! Oh, god!

01:37:18.625 --> 01:37:20.661
Oh, god, I think I've broken my...

01:37:22.125 --> 01:37:24.491
I think I've broken my leg, Charles.

01:37:25.375 --> 01:37:26.831
Oh, god, Charles.

01:37:28.833 --> 01:37:30.573
Oh, my god!

01:37:30.833 --> 01:37:32.118
Oh, god!

01:37:53.375 --> 01:37:55.957
Oh, god, Charles, no, please.

01:38:11.417 --> 01:38:12.873
Now fry and lie still.

01:38:45.958 --> 01:38:48.074
I'm going to take a look and see.

01:38:48.333 --> 01:38:49.493
See what's wrong.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.332
- I don't feel well.
- Take a shot of this.

01:39:01.125 --> 01:39:03.241
Just going to take a look here.

01:39:11.042 --> 01:39:12.042
Hold on.

01:39:16.083 --> 01:39:18.620
I only have so much
of that stuff in me.

01:39:21.625 --> 01:39:22.990
Charles, what is it?

01:39:23.333 --> 01:39:24.743
What is it, Charles?

01:39:26.875 --> 01:39:28.331
I don't feel very...

01:39:30.208 --> 01:39:33.075
I can't say that I feel
very well at all, Charles.

01:39:36.958 --> 01:39:38.198
Hell of a guy.

01:39:38.917 --> 01:39:40.828
I never told you that.

01:39:43.083 --> 01:39:45.825
Fucking shit-hole of a world,
eh, Charles?

01:39:47.542 --> 01:39:49.123
Shit-hole of a world.

01:39:52.792 --> 01:39:54.407
I need you to... what?

01:39:54.667 --> 01:39:55.907
Put pressure on it.

01:39:56.167 --> 01:39:57.452
- What's that?
- Now.

01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:23.331
Jesus.

01:41:29.333 --> 01:41:30.333
Listen.

01:41:31.625 --> 01:41:33.490
We're gonna get you out of here.

01:41:34.125 --> 01:41:35.331
Okay?

01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:32.412
Hell of a way to end an outing.

01:42:34.458 --> 01:42:35.948
You're gonna be fine.

01:42:37.792 --> 01:42:39.578
Must be quite a thing.

01:42:40.208 --> 01:42:41.288
Quite a thing.

01:42:41.542 --> 01:42:42.748
To have so much.

01:42:46.667 --> 01:42:47.827
Everybody...

01:42:48.792 --> 01:42:50.157
Wants something from you.

01:42:51.208 --> 01:42:53.164
Everybody depending on you.

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:55.285
Don't talk so much.

01:42:58.292 --> 01:42:59.748
So pushy.

01:43:00.417 --> 01:43:02.248
Why don't you save your energy?

01:43:05.042 --> 01:43:07.408
I don't really feel quite 100%.

01:43:08.125 --> 01:43:09.865
I'm gonna take us into shore.

01:43:10.125 --> 01:43:12.912
Light us a fire. Keep you warm.

01:43:30.208 --> 01:43:32.995
Why would you want to save
a piece of shit like me?

01:43:33.458 --> 01:43:35.414
Let's say it's a challenge.

01:43:37.125 --> 01:43:39.537
For the sporting aspect of it?

01:43:40.125 --> 01:43:42.741
No, I know what it is.

01:43:44.125 --> 01:43:47.197
You've never had a buddy.
That's the thing, isn't it?

01:43:47.458 --> 01:43:48.458
Right.

01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:51.491
Now I'm your pet project.

01:43:52.083 --> 01:43:53.368
I'm your...

01:43:53.625 --> 01:43:55.411
Hobby farm.

01:43:56.750 --> 01:43:58.615
Whatever you say, Bob.

01:43:59.542 --> 01:44:01.157
Guy who tried to kill you.

01:44:01.417 --> 01:44:04.250
- That's terrific, Charles.
- No, you wouldn't have done it.

01:44:04.958 --> 01:44:06.323
Yes, I would have.

01:44:06.667 --> 01:44:08.623
You stupid son of a bitch.

01:44:10.583 --> 01:44:11.868
Yes, I would.

01:44:21.542 --> 01:44:22.702
Then...

01:44:23.250 --> 01:44:24.285
You would.

01:44:30.458 --> 01:44:32.494
What will you do when you get back?

01:44:34.375 --> 01:44:36.240
It's not important.

01:44:37.542 --> 01:44:39.407
It is important to me.

01:44:43.458 --> 01:44:44.948
I may not go back.

01:44:49.042 --> 01:44:51.499
What do you mean?
Of course you'll go back.

01:44:53.292 --> 01:44:54.623
To what?

01:44:58.542 --> 01:45:00.703
I don't feel sorry for you, Charles.

01:45:01.833 --> 01:45:04.575
"Never feel sorry for a man
that owns a plane.â

01:45:06.542 --> 01:45:07.702
Come on.

01:45:07.958 --> 01:45:09.198
Hold on.

01:45:09.458 --> 01:45:10.493
Hold on.

01:45:11.250 --> 01:45:12.740
I'll get us out of here.

01:45:14.667 --> 01:45:15.907
How bullshit.

01:45:19.917 --> 01:45:21.157
I'm dying.

01:45:22.792 --> 01:45:25.579
I'm dying and I never did
a goddamn thing.

01:45:27.708 --> 01:45:28.948
But wait.

01:45:29.750 --> 01:45:31.490
Charles, I gotta tell you.

01:45:34.458 --> 01:45:35.573
What?

01:45:38.958 --> 01:45:40.164
I'm sorry.

01:45:43.125 --> 01:45:44.990
I'm sorry what I did.

01:45:46.750 --> 01:45:48.490
And your wife, Charles.

01:45:49.542 --> 01:45:51.157
Listen to me, Charles.

01:45:51.458 --> 01:45:53.119
She was never in on it.

01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:55.365
This business.

01:45:58.375 --> 01:45:59.615
Doing you in.

01:46:01.250 --> 01:46:03.411
I swear it on my life, Charles.

01:46:09.208 --> 01:46:10.243
Thanks.

01:46:11.125 --> 01:46:13.241
Very kind of you to say so, Bob.

01:46:16.083 --> 01:46:18.665
Never too late for a kind gesture, eh?

01:46:20.125 --> 01:46:22.036
Don't die on me, Bob.

01:46:26.583 --> 01:46:28.289
Don't tell me what to do.

01:46:34.667 --> 01:46:35.782
Hold on.

01:46:38.208 --> 01:46:39.493
We're getting out of here!

01:46:49.875 --> 01:46:51.581
Over here!

01:46:52.750 --> 01:46:53.750
Over here!

01:47:24.375 --> 01:47:25.956
Over here!

01:50:14.958 --> 01:50:17.165
Why is the rabbit unafraid?

01:50:19.125 --> 01:50:21.286
Because he's smarter than the panther.

01:50:37.333 --> 01:50:38.539
Mr. morse?

01:50:39.333 --> 01:50:40.333
Mr. morse?

01:50:40.792 --> 01:50:43.829
Channel 9 news. Could we get
a statement, sir?

01:51:36.292 --> 01:51:39.284
How did you feel during
your husband's ordeal?

01:51:46.292 --> 01:51:48.157
We're all put to the test.

01:51:48.958 --> 01:51:50.823
But it never comes in the...

01:51:51.333 --> 01:51:52.914
Form or the...

01:51:54.417 --> 01:51:56.157
Point we would prefer...

01:51:56.750 --> 01:51:57.910
Does it?

01:51:59.583 --> 01:52:00.698
Mr. morse?

01:52:00.958 --> 01:52:02.038
The other men...

01:52:02.292 --> 01:52:03.498
Your friends...?

01:52:05.208 --> 01:52:06.573
My friends.

01:52:09.792 --> 01:52:11.407
What happened to them, sir?

01:52:15.167 --> 01:52:16.748
How did they die, sir?

01:52:23.208 --> 01:52:24.539
They died...

01:52:25.583 --> 01:52:27.164
Saving my life.
