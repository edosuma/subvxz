00:01.859 --> 00:04.030
Previously on This Is Us...

00:04.074 --> 00:07.246
I haven't had a happy life.
Some would call it sad,

00:07.271 --> 00:08.571
but I don't.

00:11.422 --> 00:13.179
Why did you choose to get drunk?

00:13.204 --> 00:15.128
You embarrassed me
in front of my friends.

00:15.130 --> 00:17.764
Deja, your mom might not
be coming back for a while.

00:17.766 --> 00:19.367
What do you mean? Yes, she will.

00:20.435 --> 00:21.554
I'm pregnant.

00:53.489 --> 00:54.890
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:55.625 --> 00:57.558
- Nice to meet you.
- Hey. Come on in.

00:57.560 --> 00:59.260
- How are you?
- Thank you. Very good.

00:59.262 --> 01:01.729
Okay. Right here
is where the babies sleep.

01:01.731 --> 01:04.397
We got Randall right here,
next to Kevin and Kate.

01:04.400 --> 01:06.534
And we are absolutely
getting a changing table

01:06.536 --> 01:08.769
in case you're wondering,
which obviously, you are,

01:08.771 --> 01:11.105
coming to check on prospective
adoptive parents.

01:11.107 --> 01:13.474
- I'm gonna stop talking.
- Yeah. We're really excited.

01:13.476 --> 01:14.937
So excited.

01:18.314 --> 01:19.828
- Hi.
- Hey, Paula.

01:19.853 --> 01:22.088
Evening, Jack. Just wanted to stop in

01:22.113 --> 01:23.980
for a quick little checkup on Randall.

01:24.554 --> 01:25.586
Come on in.

01:25.588 --> 01:27.351
Kevin just about bit
my freaking nipple off.

01:27.376 --> 01:28.967
Hey, look, it's Paula.

01:28.992 --> 01:30.210
- Hi, Paula.
- Hi.

01:30.235 --> 01:31.769
- Come on in.
- How's he doing? Hi.

01:31.793 --> 01:33.226
Oh, he's good. He's great.

01:34.114 --> 01:35.614
Hi, Paula.

01:36.640 --> 01:38.142
- How are you?
- Good.

01:40.421 --> 01:43.371
This is leftover from yesterday.
Now, we don't usually give

01:43.373 --> 01:44.515
Randall too much sugar.

01:44.540 --> 01:46.515
I just figured, for a first birthday...

01:46.540 --> 01:49.087
Rebecca, your kids
can have birthday cake.

01:49.112 --> 01:50.278
I won't hold it against you.

01:50.280 --> 01:51.796
- Okay, thanks.
- So, the judge,

01:51.821 --> 01:53.531
he has all this paperwork?

01:53.556 --> 01:55.523
Yes, along with
my glowing recommendation.

01:55.968 --> 01:58.101
Now, this next part is just a formality.

01:58.406 --> 02:00.062
You'll go before Judge Bradley,

02:00.087 --> 02:01.773
and he'll ask you a few questions, like,

02:01.798 --> 02:03.598
"Do you wish to adopt this child?"

02:03.888 --> 02:05.851
And you'll say, "Yes, we do."

02:06.181 --> 02:07.993
- We need to commemorate this moment.
- No, babe,

02:08.017 --> 02:09.812
- I-I don't think we need anymore...
- We need pictures.

02:09.836 --> 02:12.053
- We need new pictures.
- We're gonna get new pictures.

02:12.078 --> 02:13.765
Okay. That's good.

02:20.071 --> 02:21.812
Hang on.

02:21.837 --> 02:25.820
I'm having a little trouble
balancing your skin tones.

02:25.922 --> 02:27.523
So, what are these for? First birthday?

02:27.548 --> 02:29.476
No, they're for our adoption notice

02:29.501 --> 02:30.843
for our son, Randall.

02:31.173 --> 02:33.000
Bet you can't guess
which one Randall is.

02:33.025 --> 02:34.094
Sorry.

02:34.118 --> 02:36.454
We don't get a lot of families
that look like yours in here.

02:36.478 --> 02:38.898
Either you're blown out,
or Randall's a dark blob.

02:38.923 --> 02:40.851
- Shh.
- You know what? Just do your best.

02:40.876 --> 02:42.070
- It happens a lot.
- Yeah.

02:42.095 --> 02:44.609
We got about 30 seconds...
Before one of them craps, barfs,

02:44.634 --> 02:46.867
- or all three just lose their minds.
- Yep.

02:46.892 --> 02:48.703
All right, big smiles on three.

02:48.728 --> 02:50.906
One, two, three.

02:50.951 --> 02:52.539
Steelers!

02:52.883 --> 02:55.950
Face right.

02:56.327 --> 02:58.945
The court accepts
your guilty plea, Mr. Hill.

02:58.970 --> 03:01.515
And since you are unable to post bail,

03:01.540 --> 03:04.382
you'll be remanded
until your sentencing hearing.

03:04.606 --> 03:05.875
Do you understand?

03:08.320 --> 03:09.554
You have no record.

03:10.114 --> 03:12.257
Not so much as a traffic violation.

03:13.210 --> 03:16.820
So, I must admit, I find this
arrest rather disappointing.

03:18.573 --> 03:21.335
What would you have me do, Your Honor?

03:24.462 --> 03:25.828
On every corner,

03:26.547 --> 03:27.929
there's someone selling,

03:29.318 --> 03:33.335
so I buy... and I use.

03:34.384 --> 03:36.812
If you had my life,
you'd probably use, too.

03:39.096 --> 03:41.320
Just a year ago, my mother was alive,

03:43.339 --> 03:44.882
and my girl was alive,

03:46.742 --> 03:48.328
and we were having a son.

03:50.237 --> 03:51.304
Now, they're gone.

03:52.843 --> 03:54.773
- They're all gone.
- Mr. Hill...

03:54.798 --> 03:58.828
So, I come here, and you tell me
you're disappointed?

04:00.653 --> 04:01.695
Well, guess what?

04:02.863 --> 04:04.406
I am more disappointed.

04:05.382 --> 04:07.578
I am the most disappointed man

04:07.603 --> 04:09.890
you've ever met in your whole damn life.

04:11.487 --> 04:13.625
So, if you want to lock me up,
lock me up.

04:14.954 --> 04:18.164
Put me inside, because there is
nothing out here for me anymore.

04:41.201 --> 04:42.132
Thanks.

04:42.157 --> 04:43.671
No, we'll see you at 10:00.

04:44.273 --> 04:45.734
- Who was that?
- Uh, Linda.

04:45.759 --> 04:48.179
Deja and me are meeting her
at the clink this morning.

04:48.188 --> 04:51.164
"The clink"? Baby, why you sound
like a character from The Wire?

04:51.189 --> 04:52.601
Because it's not fair, Beth.

04:53.085 --> 04:55.693
I mean, Deja's 12 years old,
and I got to take her to visit

04:55.695 --> 04:57.195
a woman who thinks it's perfectly fine

04:57.197 --> 04:58.630
to drive her daughter around

04:58.632 --> 05:01.132
with an unlicensed gun
in the glove compartment.

05:01.134 --> 05:03.267
I know you're not looking
forward to this, babe,

05:03.269 --> 05:04.469
but it's court-ordered.

05:04.471 --> 05:05.671
The woman's a criminal.

05:05.718 --> 05:07.338
Who's also her mother.

05:08.960 --> 05:10.375
You know what? I'm-a come with y'all.

05:10.377 --> 05:11.938
I'm gonna just push
my 10:00 and make sure...

05:11.962 --> 05:14.515
No, nope. I-I got this. You go to work.

05:15.141 --> 05:17.141
Somebody's got to pay
for my cold brew habit.

05:17.143 --> 05:19.125
These beans don't grow on trees.

05:19.226 --> 05:20.593
You know, actually, they do.

05:20.805 --> 05:22.104
I mean, technically,
it's not a tree, but...

05:22.106 --> 05:24.070
- I got it.
- Okay.

05:24.859 --> 05:26.311
Morning, Destiny's Children.

05:26.336 --> 05:27.500
- Good morning!
- Morning!

05:27.525 --> 05:28.570
Hey.

05:28.968 --> 05:30.335
You look very pretty.

05:30.505 --> 05:32.132
- Nice dress.
- Thanks.

05:32.468 --> 05:35.000
Um... It's my mom's favorite.

05:36.016 --> 05:37.070
Car bagel?

05:38.817 --> 05:39.960
Let's go.

05:40.316 --> 05:41.382
See you, guys.

05:41.894 --> 05:43.320
- Bye, baby.
- Bye, babe.

05:43.421 --> 05:45.006
Who's driving? You or me?

05:45.778 --> 05:46.828
Me?

05:57.742 --> 05:58.789
Baby, what's up?

05:58.916 --> 06:01.250
Hey, are you all packed for your flight?

06:01.546 --> 06:03.437
I stocked up on all your favorites.

06:04.054 --> 06:07.078
Even that weird tea that I can't say.

06:07.210 --> 06:09.110
It's... ma-macha...

06:09.112 --> 06:10.570
- Mach-ta?
- Matcha.

06:10.595 --> 06:12.428
Right. Um, also,

06:12.453 --> 06:14.002
I'm-I'm trying to change my shift,

06:14.027 --> 06:15.387
so I can pick you up from the airport.

06:15.411 --> 06:16.421
Oh...

06:17.172 --> 06:19.773
Yeah, uh... L-Listen,
we might have to push that...

06:20.554 --> 06:22.323
till next week,
because there's this, uh,

06:22.325 --> 06:23.758
there's this director out here

06:23.760 --> 06:25.280
that my agent really wants me to meet.

06:26.174 --> 06:28.804
Kevin, this is the third time
you've pushed.

06:29.835 --> 06:31.992
- I know. You're right.
- Just be honest.

06:32.265 --> 06:34.210
Do you even want to move out here?

06:34.637 --> 06:36.203
What? Do I want to... of course
I want to move out there.

06:36.205 --> 06:37.460
What are you talking about?

06:37.485 --> 06:39.257
Because it feels like you're stalling,

06:39.476 --> 06:41.703
and it's getting ridiculous.

06:41.728 --> 06:43.546
- Soph, listen...
- Kev, you came to me.

06:43.563 --> 06:46.116
You showed up at my door.
I was doing just fine,

06:46.141 --> 06:48.141
and you showed up, and you said
all that stuff, and,

06:48.143 --> 06:49.726
you know...

06:52.015 --> 06:54.132
Crap, I have to go. Listen, just...

06:56.132 --> 06:57.476
Let's just talk about it later.

06:57.786 --> 06:59.140
- Okay?
- Okay.

06:59.529 --> 07:00.656
All right.

07:01.659 --> 07:03.156
Hey, Soph, uh...

07:04.789 --> 07:06.389
I just want to tell you that I love you.

07:06.527 --> 07:07.539
So...

07:08.782 --> 07:09.867
Soph?

07:19.341 --> 07:20.875
Oh, Soph.

07:43.969 --> 07:45.414
How long is he gonna take?

07:45.688 --> 07:47.531
I don't... Yep... yep.

07:47.875 --> 07:49.538
- What's up, Mount Keverest?
- Kev!

07:49.563 --> 07:50.766
All right, make it quick, all right?

07:50.790 --> 07:52.445
Because I got to go home and pack.

07:52.470 --> 07:54.593
I'm flying to New York tonight
to promise Sophie

07:54.618 --> 07:56.218
that I would fix things with her, so...

07:57.125 --> 07:58.899
Okay, you're gonna want to sit for this.

07:59.414 --> 08:00.507
Follow me.

08:02.531 --> 08:04.343
So, this is it?
This is the big surprise?

08:04.345 --> 08:06.671
You guys have just, you know,
give up, fashion-wise?

08:07.453 --> 08:08.524
Okay.

08:08.549 --> 08:09.632
One...

08:09.657 --> 08:10.679
A-two...

08:10.930 --> 08:12.492
- A-three.
- A-three.

08:15.867 --> 08:17.099
Uh...

08:17.570 --> 08:18.812
We're pregnant.

08:20.085 --> 08:21.109
You're preg...

08:21.134 --> 08:22.594
- W-We're pregnant.
- Oh, my God!

08:22.618 --> 08:24.742
This is amazing! What
am I doing over there?

08:24.767 --> 08:25.867
- Ten weeks.
- This is great.

08:25.891 --> 08:27.492
- I-I'm shocked.
- Oh, yeah!

08:27.517 --> 08:29.039
All right, this is fantastic.

08:29.064 --> 08:30.476
I mean, is he gonna be
the best dad ever?

08:30.500 --> 08:31.664
- I don't know.
- Uh, yeah.

08:31.689 --> 08:33.648
Giving the best fatherly advice.

08:33.673 --> 08:34.866
Can you see him?

08:34.892 --> 08:36.476
Yeah, I can.

08:36.501 --> 08:38.568
- Act... I really, I can.
- I don't know.

08:38.592 --> 08:41.059
Uh, no, I think so. And you're
gonna read bedtime stories.

08:45.677 --> 08:47.984
- Shh... Hey. Hey, sweetie.
- Shh, shh, shh..

08:48.242 --> 08:49.179
Pearsons?

08:49.204 --> 08:50.688
- We're here, we're here.
- That's us.

08:50.712 --> 08:51.953
Shh, shh, it's okay.

08:51.978 --> 08:53.077
Hi.

08:53.165 --> 08:55.406
- Sorry, there's a few of us.
- Hello.

08:56.148 --> 08:57.507
I have read your report,

08:57.532 --> 09:00.000
and I have some questions
about your home visits.

09:00.025 --> 09:01.991
Uh, I'd like to speak
with your social worker,

09:02.053 --> 09:03.296
"Paula Miller"?

09:03.430 --> 09:04.726
She's not here, sir.

09:05.140 --> 09:08.062
Uh, she told us that
everything you would need

09:08.087 --> 09:09.421
could be found in our file.

09:09.564 --> 09:10.570
Hmm.

09:10.663 --> 09:13.000
Well, as I said, I have some questions.

09:13.156 --> 09:15.467
Uh, so, right now,
we're about three weeks out.

09:15.469 --> 09:17.562
My clerk with put you back
on the docket. Thank you.

09:17.869 --> 09:19.802
- The Andersons?
- Come on.

09:20.529 --> 09:22.265
- All right.
- Okay.

09:32.625 --> 09:33.882
Um, maybe we can, uh,

09:33.952 --> 09:35.351
s-sit over...

09:36.349 --> 09:38.593
- Hold on.
- W-What are you doing?

09:39.117 --> 09:40.179
It's... My bad.

09:40.204 --> 09:41.429
Parental instinct.

09:41.454 --> 09:43.085
I've seen people in handcuffs before.

09:43.110 --> 09:44.242
I'm not scared.

09:44.568 --> 09:45.835
No, of course.

09:46.737 --> 09:48.370
I've seen people
in handcuffs, too, so...

09:48.450 --> 09:50.609
Oh, really? In real life, or on TV?

09:50.634 --> 09:52.210
Come on, man. Real life.

09:54.558 --> 09:55.585
TV.

09:57.757 --> 09:58.921
Oh, hey, guys.

09:58.946 --> 10:00.218
- Hi.
- Hi, Miss Linda.

10:00.243 --> 10:03.671
So, Deja, you're gonna be in a
special visiting area today.

10:03.731 --> 10:05.964
No glass divides or telephones.

10:05.989 --> 10:07.750
You're gonna be able to hug your mom.

10:10.137 --> 10:11.336
- Cool.
- Shall we?

10:11.361 --> 10:12.527
Yeah.

10:52.156 --> 10:53.937
Jack, I don't understand.

10:53.962 --> 10:56.335
Paula raved about us in our file.

10:56.360 --> 10:58.882
What does the judge want
to talk to her about?

11:00.571 --> 11:01.781
Let's go find out.

11:02.112 --> 11:03.112
What?

11:03.137 --> 11:04.604
No. Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack.

11:04.629 --> 11:06.375
Excuse me, Judge Bradley. Hi.

11:06.474 --> 11:08.882
Jack Pearson. My-my wife Rebecca.

11:08.954 --> 11:10.054
I remember.

11:10.215 --> 11:11.890
And you're not supposed to approach me

11:11.915 --> 11:14.382
- outside the courtroom.
- Yeah, but... I'm sorry. I know.

11:14.407 --> 11:17.143
We're very sorry, sir,
but, um, is there any way

11:17.168 --> 11:19.078
that we could talk to you
for just one minute?

11:19.278 --> 11:20.359
Please?

11:22.906 --> 11:24.093
Come in my chambers.

11:30.447 --> 11:31.859
Your curls are killing it.

11:32.245 --> 11:33.726
What do they call that, a big chop?

11:34.493 --> 11:36.750
Your mom's gonna love it.

11:38.590 --> 11:40.335
Hey, I'll be right back.

11:43.510 --> 11:45.757
What's up? We've been
waiting for a while.

11:46.820 --> 11:48.031
Shauna's not coming.

11:49.015 --> 11:50.671
What do you mean, Shauna's not coming?

11:51.787 --> 11:53.414
She opted out of seeing Deja.

11:53.439 --> 11:54.609
It happens sometimes.

11:55.566 --> 11:56.921
I don't understand.

11:56.946 --> 11:58.554
You said this was a mandatory visit.

11:58.579 --> 12:00.156
She has the right to opt out.

12:00.735 --> 12:01.945
I'm sorry, what about...

12:01.970 --> 12:03.437
- what about Deja's rights?
- I...

12:03.462 --> 12:04.915
We've been looking forward
to this for weeks.

12:04.939 --> 12:07.054
- I know. I'm sorry.
- That's great.

12:07.079 --> 12:09.239
I'll let Deja know you're sorry.
I'm sure that'll help.

12:09.832 --> 12:12.265
- Excuse me?
- Sometimes I can't help but wonder

12:12.290 --> 12:14.226
if anyone's actually
looking out for these kids.

12:15.527 --> 12:16.914
You wonder if...

12:21.231 --> 12:23.132
Randall, last month we got a girl

12:23.541 --> 12:26.062
who had an ear infection
when she was an infant.

12:26.402 --> 12:29.648
- Just a minor little ear infection.
- Mm-hmm.

12:29.673 --> 12:32.741
Totally treatable... except her
birth parents didn't treat it.

12:32.873 --> 12:34.593
They ignored it for six months,

12:34.618 --> 12:36.484
and now she's four and she's deaf.

12:36.632 --> 12:38.531
Do you know how hard it is
to find someone

12:38.556 --> 12:40.140
who'll take in a deaf four-year-old?

12:40.401 --> 12:42.367
Do you know how many times

12:42.392 --> 12:44.526
I have held up a photograph of her

12:44.551 --> 12:46.773
and shown prospective foster parents,

12:46.798 --> 12:49.062
and I've watched their faces light up?

12:49.146 --> 12:51.242
And then I watched
those smiles disappear

12:51.267 --> 12:52.703
when I tell them she's deaf.

12:53.455 --> 12:55.406
Do you know how to say, "Sorry, sweetie,

12:55.431 --> 12:58.507
we still haven't found a family
for you," in sign language?

12:58.532 --> 13:00.000
Because I do.

13:00.566 --> 13:01.703
So, please...

13:02.792 --> 13:05.156
don't tell me you wonder
if anyone's out there

13:05.181 --> 13:06.695
looking out for these kids.

13:12.073 --> 13:13.304
I'm sorry, Linda.

13:22.429 --> 13:24.304
Did Shauna say why
she didn't want to see her?

13:25.487 --> 13:26.523
No.

13:44.016 --> 13:45.718
Apparently, there was a mix-up,

13:46.206 --> 13:47.796
and, um...

13:48.637 --> 13:51.375
our visit wasn't cleared
with the folks here.

13:53.776 --> 13:55.148
So she's not coming?

13:58.606 --> 13:59.976
I'm so sorry, Deja.

14:00.896 --> 14:03.695
I know how much you were looking
forward to seeing your mom.

14:13.078 --> 14:14.531
Um... could I go get my purse?

14:15.272 --> 14:16.960
Yeah, we can get it on the way back.

14:16.985 --> 14:18.265
No, I need it now.

14:18.641 --> 14:19.695
Why?

14:20.917 --> 14:23.484
I've been saving up
my allowance for my mom,

14:23.677 --> 14:26.281
so that she can get
everything she needs in here.

14:29.048 --> 14:30.218
Okay.

14:32.065 --> 14:34.726
We'll go get your purse, then figure
out who to give the money to.

14:51.036 --> 14:52.321
- Congratulations.
- I'm glad you came over.

14:52.345 --> 14:54.211
- Thank you for coming, you guys.
- Hey.

14:54.236 --> 14:56.110
- I'm so... happy for you.
- Thanks, man. Oh. Yeah. Okay.

14:56.134 --> 14:57.171
All right.

14:57.361 --> 14:58.516
- All right, love you guys.
- Love you.

14:58.540 --> 14:59.890
All right. All right.

15:01.953 --> 15:03.015
That went great.

15:04.150 --> 15:05.351
Did he seem off to you?

15:05.376 --> 15:07.342
Uh, yeah, I guess he seemed a little...

15:07.816 --> 15:09.695
- a little distracted.
- Yeah.

15:09.845 --> 15:11.144
Okay, so, we told Kev.

15:11.919 --> 15:13.062
Now on to your mom.

15:13.432 --> 15:15.007
No, uh, wait.

15:15.380 --> 15:17.146
Yeah, see, still... it's a little early.

15:17.171 --> 15:19.405
And so we should,
uh, we should just give her

15:19.430 --> 15:21.235
a couple of hours to get
through her "Judge Block."

15:21.259 --> 15:23.820
- I'm sorry, the... the what?
- Uh, Judge Judy,

15:23.845 --> 15:25.398
Judge Mathis, Divorce Court.

15:25.423 --> 15:28.148
Uh, she can't be...
kind of disturbed during that.

15:28.173 --> 15:30.374
So... we'll just call her after.
That's fine.

15:31.248 --> 15:32.531
- Tobe?
- Mm-hmm?

15:33.429 --> 15:35.960
Are you scared to tell your mom
that her Catholic son is having

15:35.985 --> 15:37.546
- a baby out of wedlock?
- Am I scared?

15:37.571 --> 15:40.125
- Mm-hmm.
- No. I am terrified.

15:40.150 --> 15:42.517
Do you remember how she reacted
when we told her that we

15:42.542 --> 15:45.523
- were moving in together?
- Yeah. A lot of tears.

15:45.750 --> 15:48.421
But she... you know, she got over it.

15:48.430 --> 15:49.514
Yes, she did.

15:49.539 --> 15:51.619
But bun in the unmarried oven

15:51.644 --> 15:53.867
is like a whole new level of freak out.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.773
Yeah. Okay, it's ringing.

15:55.798 --> 15:58.826
- Mm-mm. Mm-mm. Are we doing this?
- Yeah. Yeah. Yes.

15:58.851 --> 16:01.038
Okay, well, she's not gonna
answer, 'cause Judge Judy is on.

16:01.062 --> 16:02.822
- She might.
- I'm not gonna leave a message.

16:03.109 --> 16:05.123
- I should?
- I don't know.

16:05.148 --> 16:07.115
Her voice mail picked up.
Am I leaving a message?

16:07.117 --> 16:09.344
I shouldn't leave this on-on
her answering machine, should I?

16:09.368 --> 16:10.929
Kate, am I leaving a message right now?

16:10.954 --> 16:12.012
Okay, okay. Wow.

16:14.773 --> 16:16.476
- Ooh.
- Sorry.

16:21.648 --> 16:22.765
Let's get married.

16:23.199 --> 16:24.367
Yeah, we're going to.

16:24.843 --> 16:28.203
No. Let's just go to
the courthouse and get married.

16:29.234 --> 16:30.320
Really?

16:30.674 --> 16:31.757
Why not?

16:32.375 --> 16:34.609
Nothing about our relationship
has been traditional.

16:34.835 --> 16:37.623
I proposed to you when
I thought you were unconscious.

16:37.648 --> 16:40.468
You know, we decided to have
a nice, long engagement,

16:40.493 --> 16:42.550
to slow things down, and then boom!

16:43.164 --> 16:44.585
You knocked me up, so...

16:45.267 --> 16:46.664
Are you for real?

16:49.125 --> 16:50.335
Let's get married.

16:56.914 --> 16:58.085
Your Honor...

16:58.748 --> 17:01.021
Randall has been with us
for over a year...

17:01.046 --> 17:04.181
Look, let me save you some time
by being direct.

17:07.140 --> 17:09.686
I don't believe that child
belongs in your home.

17:10.875 --> 17:12.262
- What?
- Excuse me?

17:12.263 --> 17:14.546
That child belongs with a black family.

17:14.622 --> 17:15.906
Mr. and Mrs. Pearson,

17:16.160 --> 17:18.093
how else...

17:18.632 --> 17:21.604
will he see himself,
understand who he is?

17:23.598 --> 17:24.998
'Cause we will...

17:25.117 --> 17:27.069
teach him all of that.

17:27.414 --> 17:28.511
Yeah.

17:28.512 --> 17:30.203
- You will teach him?
- Yeah.

17:30.757 --> 17:33.116
Mrs. Pearson, I was nine years old

17:33.118 --> 17:35.140
before I understood that I was black.

17:35.695 --> 17:37.453
Now, I understood my skin color,

17:37.455 --> 17:39.953
the color of my friends and my parents,

17:40.296 --> 17:43.789
but I never really understood
what my blackness meant

17:44.115 --> 17:46.882
until a white man called me a nigger.

17:49.031 --> 17:50.733
And my father sat me down,

17:50.735 --> 17:52.456
and he explained to me
what that word meant.

17:53.109 --> 17:56.072
He didn't... sympathize
or feel sorry for me,

17:56.074 --> 18:00.009
because he understood all
the pain that that word elicits.

18:01.413 --> 18:04.593
My father had been called that word

18:04.986 --> 18:07.406
more times in his life
than he could count.

18:10.117 --> 18:13.556
Now, you see, what you have
in your possession

18:13.558 --> 18:17.093
is a black child who will
grow up to become a black man,

18:17.118 --> 18:18.226
and my fear...

18:19.421 --> 18:22.098
is that he won't have
the tools he needs in his life

18:22.100 --> 18:23.499
if he stays in your home.

18:25.896 --> 18:28.063
I'm... I'm sorry, sir.

18:28.578 --> 18:31.674
With all due respect... to your opinion,

18:31.676 --> 18:33.898
our son was left in a box

18:33.923 --> 18:35.812
outside of a fire station...

18:35.814 --> 18:37.580
And there are places,
and there are people

18:37.582 --> 18:39.382
who will care for him

18:39.445 --> 18:42.296
until he can be paired
with a suitable family.

18:43.437 --> 18:44.764
Now, that's my opinion.

18:44.789 --> 18:46.898
It will not change.

18:47.602 --> 18:50.398
Now, I said that this is...
inappropriate.

18:51.880 --> 18:53.648
I will see you at your next court date.

19:04.921 --> 19:08.429
If you're going for a more
vintage vibe, rose gold is

19:08.454 --> 19:10.608
- very "right now."
- Okay. Well, you know,

19:10.633 --> 19:12.765
I got to be on a red-eye
in about an hour here, Roger.

19:12.790 --> 19:14.757
So just, you know, show me
whatever's the most sparkly.

19:14.781 --> 19:16.023
- Got it.
- Okay.

19:17.210 --> 19:18.816
Do I know you from somewhere?

19:18.841 --> 19:20.207
I'm a famous person, Roger.

19:20.209 --> 19:22.076
Yeah, just, you know,
show me the diamonds.

19:22.101 --> 19:23.109
Let's see the goods.

19:23.134 --> 19:24.546
Ooh, that's good.

19:24.889 --> 19:27.123
This is... this is like
something my dad would do

19:27.148 --> 19:28.554
after he messed up with my mom.

19:28.579 --> 19:32.821
He would... do something big like
this, something romantic. You know?

19:32.993 --> 19:35.407
Well, proposing is definitely romantic.

19:35.432 --> 19:36.358
Yeah.

19:36.383 --> 19:38.867
Uh, all our selections
are conflict-free.

19:40.835 --> 19:42.304
Well, uh, Sophie will love that.

19:42.329 --> 19:44.054
That's good news. She hates conflict.

19:44.079 --> 19:45.429
You know. Hates it.

19:45.734 --> 19:48.804
I haven't exactly been the best
boyfriend lately, but I think...

19:49.595 --> 19:50.767
we're gonna be fine.

19:51.392 --> 19:52.892
- I'm sure you will.
- Yeah.

19:53.790 --> 19:54.962
I really love her.

19:55.552 --> 19:56.759
I'm sure you do.

20:02.657 --> 20:05.352
You know what? We're gonna do all three.

20:05.354 --> 20:07.477
Okay? I'll just get these three;
we'll let her decide.

20:08.652 --> 20:10.384
I'll just wrap this up.

20:13.173 --> 20:14.579
So, after I issue you

20:14.604 --> 20:16.664
the marriage license,
you come back here tomorrow

20:16.689 --> 20:18.649
for the ceremony, bring a witness,

20:18.782 --> 20:20.587
and whoosh, you're married.

20:20.914 --> 20:24.048
"Whoosh"? What is that,
the sound a marriage makes?

20:24.245 --> 20:25.267
It is here.

20:27.704 --> 20:29.213
I never imagined I'd get married

20:29.237 --> 20:30.720
under so many fluorescent lights.

20:30.745 --> 20:33.105
Yeah, but think of all the money
that we're gonna be saving.

20:33.472 --> 20:34.812
And all the other wedding crap

20:34.837 --> 20:36.102
- that we get out of.
- Totally.

20:36.127 --> 20:37.572
I don't have to go
wedding dress shopping.

20:37.596 --> 20:39.720
- Hell no, you don't.
- Right? Listen to them

20:39.745 --> 20:42.713
break it to me that none of
the pretty ones come in my size.

20:42.803 --> 20:44.540
Oh, and I don't have to listen

20:44.565 --> 20:46.220
to those random wedding guests

20:46.245 --> 20:48.095
come up to me
every five minutes and say,

20:48.120 --> 20:50.384
"Oh, your father would have
loved the day."

20:50.409 --> 20:52.343
Oh, and then, "Who's
gonna walk you down the aisle?"

20:52.367 --> 20:53.500
And father-daughter dance.

20:53.525 --> 20:54.618
Like, whatever.

20:55.022 --> 20:56.642
This is way better.

20:56.667 --> 20:58.056
Just get it over with.

20:58.081 --> 21:00.048
- Yeah.
- You guys are all set.

21:00.073 --> 21:01.181
See you back here tomorrow.

21:01.206 --> 21:02.446
- Okay.
- Uh, thanks.

21:02.497 --> 21:04.290
- Thank you.
- Congrats.

21:06.938 --> 21:07.970
Yeah.

21:17.462 --> 21:18.782
So this should be pretty quick.

21:18.807 --> 21:20.374
We'll just be in and out in...

21:21.696 --> 21:23.053
Your Honor, what is this meeting?

21:23.055 --> 21:24.488
I didn't know we'd be having any kind...

21:24.490 --> 21:26.462
I wanted a word with Mr. Hill,

21:26.487 --> 21:28.887
before his sentencing, in private.

21:29.337 --> 21:31.228
Sir, I can't advise my client

21:31.230 --> 21:32.845
to waive his rights
to speak to you or...

21:32.870 --> 21:33.923
It's okay.

21:35.708 --> 21:36.985
I'll be right outside.

21:49.289 --> 21:51.704
I gave a young man ten years today.

21:52.589 --> 21:53.782
Younger than you.

21:55.236 --> 21:56.556
He stole a TV.

21:57.595 --> 21:59.431
Ten years for stealing a TV.

21:59.467 --> 22:00.962
It wasn't even a good TV.

22:02.850 --> 22:04.274
I didn't want to do it,

22:06.017 --> 22:08.878
just like I didn't want
to give five years

22:08.903 --> 22:11.037
to a different fella yesterday,

22:11.141 --> 22:13.941
15 years to another guy
the day before that.

22:15.415 --> 22:16.563
I'm a judge,

22:17.587 --> 22:19.017
and the strange thing is...

22:20.211 --> 22:21.610
I don't make the rules.

22:22.544 --> 22:25.578
So, round and round it goes.

22:28.624 --> 22:32.931
I know the ending
to each one of those stories.

22:35.048 --> 22:36.681
And they haven't even been written yet.

22:39.415 --> 22:42.220
I'm here, Mr. Hill, because
you said something yesterday,

22:42.245 --> 22:43.595
and it stuck with me.

22:45.120 --> 22:47.688
You said you were the most
disappointed man in the world.

22:49.036 --> 22:50.493
And I'm here to tell you,

22:50.518 --> 22:53.173
I fear I am a close second, Mr. Hill.

22:54.792 --> 22:58.556
Because I'm the man who writes
terrible stories day after day,

22:58.581 --> 23:00.267
and I can't change the endings.

23:01.180 --> 23:02.423
And that, sir,

23:03.390 --> 23:07.181
is a horrible... disappointment.

23:09.704 --> 23:13.009
So, I want to see if we can find
you a different ending here.

23:14.563 --> 23:16.188
I'm gonna take a chance on you,

23:16.742 --> 23:18.517
get you out, get you help.

23:19.853 --> 23:21.688
I don't expect you to be perfect.

23:21.903 --> 23:24.267
I know you'll make mistakes,
just like the rest of us.

23:25.532 --> 23:27.392
But I will ask one thing of you.

23:29.610 --> 23:30.696
Yes, sir.

23:32.126 --> 23:34.001
I want you to look at my face.

23:35.399 --> 23:37.532
I want you to look at this too tired,

23:37.557 --> 23:40.454
too old, too fat face.

23:42.243 --> 23:43.782
Lock it in your brain.

23:45.227 --> 23:46.993
And if you ever start heading

23:47.018 --> 23:49.032
toward the ending I don't want to write,

23:50.149 --> 23:52.110
I want you to picture this ugly old mug.

23:52.135 --> 23:56.454
You picture this face,
and you make a different choice.

23:58.275 --> 23:59.517
Can you do that?

24:01.815 --> 24:04.220
Can you find me a different
ending to your story?

24:07.593 --> 24:08.759
Yes.

24:17.142 --> 24:18.782
How is she? She say anything?

24:18.807 --> 24:21.446
Not really.
She just wanted to go to sleep.

24:21.751 --> 24:24.470
You should've seen her today,
Beth, with that little purse.

24:24.759 --> 24:26.484
I mean, when she handed
over her allowance...

24:26.486 --> 24:28.619
- This mother's a real piece of work.
- Right?

24:28.621 --> 24:31.001
I mean, first she abandons
her daughter. Right?

24:31.026 --> 24:33.993
Then she lets her get tossed
from group home to group home.

24:34.018 --> 24:37.095
She's been abused, neglected,
and who knows what else.

24:37.097 --> 24:39.464
And then she doesn't even bother
to show up for the visit?

24:39.743 --> 24:41.548
- Uh-uh. Uh-uh.
- Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

24:41.573 --> 24:43.368
We're not letting her
go back over there.

24:43.782 --> 24:45.570
Well, hold on, now.
These are court-ordered visits.

24:45.572 --> 24:47.361
I don't give a damn about
a court order, Randall.

24:47.385 --> 24:49.352
I am done letting that woman
hurt that child.

24:50.102 --> 24:51.168
Okay, wait.

24:51.193 --> 24:52.900
I thought I was gonna be the one
bringing the heat here,

24:52.924 --> 24:54.596
and you were gonna calm me down,
so we switching places?

24:54.620 --> 24:55.618
Yeah, we switching, okay?

24:55.643 --> 24:57.649
Because it's our job
to protect that little girl,

24:57.674 --> 24:58.963
so we gonna do our job. So that means,

24:58.987 --> 25:00.556
as long as she's under this roof,

25:00.657 --> 25:02.697
she's not gonna have anything
to do with that woman.

25:06.454 --> 25:08.182
- You could've moved in with Natalie.
- No.

25:08.206 --> 25:10.376
- In any event...
- Mm-mm.

25:11.564 --> 25:13.095
Nope. Not gonna do it.

25:15.222 --> 25:18.623
I am not having a conversation
about this with you, sir.

25:20.079 --> 25:21.142
It's not happening.

25:21.556 --> 25:24.126
It is weird enough
that you live on the mantel.

25:26.126 --> 25:28.413
Yeah, it would've been nice
to get your permission

25:28.415 --> 25:30.329
or-or get your blessing, the right way.

25:31.329 --> 25:33.651
FYI, I would have crushed

25:33.653 --> 25:35.453
proposing to your daughter, by the way.

25:35.455 --> 25:37.288
I'm the king of romantic gestures.

25:37.290 --> 25:39.048
I hear that we have that in common.

25:40.761 --> 25:43.243
That and our insane good looks.

25:45.410 --> 25:47.712
Okay, but here's...
See, here's the thing.

25:49.128 --> 25:51.923
Kate loves weddings.

25:52.313 --> 25:54.439
All right? She watches
Say Yes to the Dress

25:54.441 --> 25:56.574
with her special
Say Yes to the Dress notebook,

25:56.576 --> 25:58.042
like she's studying.

25:58.399 --> 26:00.278
Yeah, my BS meter is going off, too,

26:00.280 --> 26:02.013
with this whole courthouse thing.

26:02.102 --> 26:04.501
I do not think that this is
what she wants to do.

26:07.793 --> 26:12.399
Anyhow, Kate says that you are
great in the advice department.

26:15.126 --> 26:17.110
So I could really use
some of that right now.

26:30.276 --> 26:32.579
Hi. How's my second favorite nurse

26:32.604 --> 26:34.118
at Manhattan General doing?

26:34.485 --> 26:36.461
Kevin Pearson, what are you doing here?

26:36.486 --> 26:37.697
What do you mean, what am I doing here?

26:37.721 --> 26:39.854
I'm here to, uh, you know,
I'm surprising Sophie.

26:40.563 --> 26:41.634
She around, or...?

26:41.659 --> 26:43.759
No, she just left
on the transport to Queens.

26:43.938 --> 26:45.321
- She'll be back soon.
- Yeah?

26:45.346 --> 26:46.745
- So you can hang out.
- All right.

26:46.856 --> 26:48.126
I'll hang out. Thank you.

27:22.381 --> 27:23.815
Didn't you hear him?

27:23.839 --> 27:25.751
What were you doing?

27:25.776 --> 27:27.618
Give him some fatherly advice, Kevin.

27:27.643 --> 27:28.665
I don't have any.

27:28.690 --> 27:30.298
- Hey, Dad, play with me.
- Later.

28:00.747 --> 28:02.056
I'm Randall Pearson.

28:03.557 --> 28:04.837
Thank you for seeing me.

28:05.502 --> 28:06.563
I'm...

28:07.317 --> 28:08.938
I'm Deja's foster father.

28:09.915 --> 28:11.071
I needed to explain...

28:11.096 --> 28:12.985
I didn't want her
to see my face like this.

28:17.978 --> 28:20.320
I wanted to explain to you
that what happened yesterday

28:20.345 --> 28:21.892
was very difficult for Deja.

28:22.907 --> 28:24.243
She was disappointed.

28:24.908 --> 28:26.876
She was really looking forward
to seeing you.

28:27.580 --> 28:30.602
When you make a commitment to
a child, you got to stick to it.

28:30.627 --> 28:32.773
Well, next time I'll
reschedule getting jumped.

28:32.798 --> 28:34.051
Well, obviously,
I'm not familiar with...

28:34.053 --> 28:35.886
No, no, please, continue.

28:35.888 --> 28:38.122
You seem to know all about my situation.

28:40.384 --> 28:41.602
Deja's doing well.

28:43.229 --> 28:45.571
She gets along with
my wife and my daughters.

28:45.596 --> 28:46.751
They're close to her age.

28:47.099 --> 28:49.704
We're thinking of enrolling her
in Woodside Middle School.

28:50.438 --> 28:52.870
Last foster parents
let her stay at her old school.

28:52.872 --> 28:54.838
She's got friends there.
She's on drill team.

28:54.840 --> 28:56.493
Woodside's an excellent school.

28:56.518 --> 28:58.727
I'm sure the cheerleading squad
there is pretty great.

29:00.188 --> 29:01.779
You got a white wife?

29:01.781 --> 29:02.790
Excuse me?

29:03.185 --> 29:05.460
Cheerleading is not drill team.

29:05.485 --> 29:06.750
I know the difference. Thank you.

29:06.752 --> 29:08.719
And don't get it twisted, sis,
I wake up every morning

29:08.721 --> 29:10.454
next to a head scarf and coconut oil.

29:10.456 --> 29:11.892
I'm married to a black queen,

29:12.149 --> 29:13.657
not that it's any of your business.

29:14.282 --> 29:16.026
You know what? You made the choices

29:16.102 --> 29:19.707
that got you in here,
but your daughter is a child,

29:20.267 --> 29:21.532
and I don't think you know the half

29:21.534 --> 29:23.277
of what she's been through
because of you.

29:23.743 --> 29:25.536
So you don't need to be worried
about me or my wife.

29:25.538 --> 29:27.617
You need to be focused
on what's best for Deja.

29:27.642 --> 29:29.220
Oh, let me guess. That's you?

29:29.245 --> 29:31.220
I'm on this side of the glass, aren't I?

29:35.055 --> 29:37.196
You know, that's not
the first time I've heard that.

29:37.997 --> 29:39.829
"I'm on the other side of the glass."

29:40.355 --> 29:42.655
My ex Lonzo said that same exact thing

29:42.657 --> 29:44.476
sitting right there where
you are right now.

29:44.501 --> 29:47.524
- Is he...?
- No. He's not Deja's father.

29:49.311 --> 29:51.165
He took off when Deja was eight.

29:52.168 --> 29:55.345
Mm-mm, Lonzo is the fool
who got me in this mess.

29:56.243 --> 29:58.671
Met him in rehab
when I was trying to get right.

29:59.931 --> 30:01.071
Ain't that something?

30:01.382 --> 30:04.150
Trying to get right, and I get Lonzo.

30:06.922 --> 30:08.181
That's unfortunate.

30:10.579 --> 30:12.852
I wound up on this side
of the glass, yeah.

30:13.790 --> 30:15.388
And you wound up over there,

30:15.390 --> 30:17.493
no doubt 'cause things broke your way.

30:20.743 --> 30:22.915
Don't you dare say
I'm in here by choice.

30:23.579 --> 30:25.806
People who have choices say that mess.

30:27.514 --> 30:29.548
Deja's the one good thing I've done.

30:30.792 --> 30:34.267
And I thank you for watching out
for her, but make no mistake,

30:34.966 --> 30:36.579
all right, you can give her your money,

30:37.313 --> 30:39.011
and you can give her your cheerleading,

30:39.013 --> 30:40.462
but I gave her my blood.

30:41.495 --> 30:44.532
And if you want to know
what's best for her, it's me.

30:45.620 --> 30:48.259
And the second I get out of
here, I'm coming back for her.

30:50.051 --> 30:51.649
You gonna have to go through me.

30:54.110 --> 30:55.704
I've been through worse.

31:06.938 --> 31:08.485
Oh, thank God. Okay.

31:09.493 --> 31:12.645
Babe, you okay?

31:12.647 --> 31:14.647
- Yeah.
- You look like you're gonna faint.

31:14.649 --> 31:17.446
Listen, I, uh, I called my mom
and I told her about the baby.

31:17.954 --> 31:19.385
Uh, she cried a little bit,

31:19.387 --> 31:21.915
then she hung up
so she could call her priest.

31:22.056 --> 31:23.165
Okay.

31:23.751 --> 31:26.860
Yes. Okay, and now...

I noticed you had some
photographs of families

34:08.922 --> 34:10.001
on your wall,

34:10.025 --> 34:12.493
so I thought I'd send you ours.

34:13.103 --> 34:17.594
Randall is my son,
whether you approve or not,

34:17.620 --> 34:19.509
whether you sign a paper or not.

34:20.360 --> 34:23.402
And, yes, certain things
are harder for us.

34:23.993 --> 34:26.226
Family portraits, for instance are...

34:26.541 --> 34:28.047
...not our strong suit.

34:28.775 --> 34:33.579
Exposure is tricky for
the Pearsons, so we make do.

34:34.235 --> 34:36.282
But the thing you need to know about us

34:36.306 --> 34:38.016
is that the Pearsons keep at it.

34:38.041 --> 34:39.306
We don't stop.

34:39.612 --> 34:42.391
So, I suggest you put us up
on your wall.

34:43.071 --> 34:45.110
Maybe it will help you
get used to our faces

34:45.135 --> 34:48.618
because we will keep coming
until you do your job.

34:49.259 --> 34:53.966
Sincerely, Rebecca Pearson,
Randall's mother.

35:05.634 --> 35:07.648
Oh, my God.
Where the hell have you been?

35:07.673 --> 35:09.306
The hospital said you came by. I...

35:10.345 --> 35:11.618
Kevin, are you okay?

35:12.923 --> 35:15.618
- Are... Hey, c-come inside.
- Sophie, I don't know how to do this.

35:16.485 --> 35:17.844
How to do what? What's wrong?

35:18.376 --> 35:20.907
I didn't just buy one, Soph.
I bought three.

35:22.282 --> 35:25.079
I bought three because
I couldn't decide which one.

35:25.868 --> 35:27.828
Kevin, what are you...
what are you talking about?

35:27.860 --> 35:30.767
I don't know how to be a husband to you.

35:31.962 --> 35:33.977
I don't know how to be a father
to our kids.

35:35.837 --> 35:38.532
I don't. I-I don't have
anything to give you.

35:38.696 --> 35:41.817
There's nothing inside of me
to give to you, okay?

35:41.842 --> 35:42.915
I don't have anything.

35:42.940 --> 35:45.180
I'm a, I'm a, I'm a, I'm an empty shell.

35:48.009 --> 35:51.884
Kevin, you're... you're spiraling. Okay?

35:53.032 --> 35:54.515
What's going on? This isn't you.

35:54.540 --> 35:56.506
No, no, no, no. This is me, okay?

35:56.508 --> 35:57.595
This is me.

35:57.665 --> 35:58.986
The guy who comes to your doorstep

35:59.010 --> 36:00.212
and says those things to you?

36:00.237 --> 36:03.017
That-that-that is not me. That's not me.

36:03.042 --> 36:05.081
That-that-that's me
trying to be that guy,

36:05.083 --> 36:06.716
that guy who-who does that kind of thing

36:06.718 --> 36:08.519
or the guy who says
that kind of thing to you.

36:08.970 --> 36:11.354
That's me trying to be my dad, okay?

36:11.356 --> 36:12.571
Or-or-or-or Toby.

36:12.970 --> 36:15.907
Or-or every great man
from every really good movie,

36:15.932 --> 36:18.524
but it's not me, okay?
I was playing a part.

36:18.759 --> 36:21.095
You were disappointed that
I postponed my trip two times?

36:21.120 --> 36:22.510
Trust me when I tell you I'm saving you

36:22.534 --> 36:24.954
from 40 years of disappointment with me.

36:26.959 --> 36:29.118
Kevin, what are you saying
to me right now?

36:32.067 --> 36:34.931
I'm saying when I... when I
dream of our future together...

36:36.063 --> 36:37.571
Sophie, it's a nightmare.

36:38.603 --> 36:40.670
For me, okay? It's a nightmare.

36:42.056 --> 36:43.696
Listen, I'm not trying to hurt you.

36:44.548 --> 36:45.712
I don't want to hurt you.

36:46.455 --> 36:47.759
Soph.

37:05.899 --> 37:08.478
This has been the longest
three weeks of my life.

37:08.480 --> 37:09.830
Well, he's gonna see us today, babe.

37:09.854 --> 37:11.985
I can... I can feel it.

37:12.032 --> 37:13.383
We got through to him.

37:13.681 --> 37:15.265
Mr. and Mrs. Pearson?

37:15.290 --> 37:17.204
You've been moved to another judge.

37:18.000 --> 37:18.891
What?

37:18.938 --> 37:21.360
Judge Bradley recused himself
from your case.

37:21.477 --> 37:22.946
I'll show you where you'll be.

37:24.360 --> 37:25.470
Okay. Come on.

37:26.431 --> 37:29.196
Recused? Is that a good or a bad thing?

37:31.688 --> 37:33.134
And who do we have here?

37:33.372 --> 37:37.134
Oh, we usually just call them
one, two and three.

37:37.790 --> 37:39.126
So well-behaved.

37:39.151 --> 37:40.931
Oh, give them time.

37:42.258 --> 37:43.407
Okay.

37:44.259 --> 37:46.298
If you don't mind
raising your right hand...

37:46.323 --> 37:48.618
Okay, one hand will do.

37:48.620 --> 37:50.751
- Shh, okay. Shh, shh, shh.
- Uh, to affirm that the testimony

37:50.775 --> 37:52.868
you are about to give is
the truth, the whole truth

37:52.893 --> 37:53.916
and nothing but the truth.

37:53.940 --> 37:54.950
- Yes.
- We do.

37:54.975 --> 37:56.634
Do you wish to adopt this child

37:56.659 --> 37:58.290
as your legally adopted son?

37:58.315 --> 37:59.548
- We do.
- We do.

37:59.792 --> 38:01.938
And what name shall this child be known?

38:02.487 --> 38:05.056
Um, Randall Kenneth Pearson.

38:06.048 --> 38:07.556
You have done the hard work.

38:07.581 --> 38:09.118
You have chosen to love.

38:09.579 --> 38:14.079
I, on the other hand, have the
pleasure of signing it into law.

38:14.104 --> 38:15.735
Congratulations.

38:15.760 --> 38:18.259
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

38:21.790 --> 38:22.860
Thank you.

38:42.204 --> 38:44.560
Unfortunately,
the cancer is not responding

38:44.562 --> 38:45.681
to the treatment.

38:45.706 --> 38:47.438
There's not much else we can do.

38:47.831 --> 38:51.384
I suggest you try and enjoy
what time you have left.

39:29.609 --> 39:30.868
Hey, little mama.

39:31.185 --> 39:33.071
- Hi.
- Hi, Dad.

39:33.096 --> 39:34.462
What's going on?

39:35.051 --> 39:36.290
- So...
- Hmm?

39:36.375 --> 39:37.501
How was she?

39:38.578 --> 39:39.735
Oh, man.

39:40.168 --> 39:41.860
She was, uh...

39:43.092 --> 39:45.192
everything I thought she'd be

39:45.217 --> 39:47.298
and somehow nothing I expected.

39:49.524 --> 39:51.032
She wants Deja back.

39:53.743 --> 39:55.126
We're falling for this kid.

39:55.179 --> 39:56.290
I know.

39:56.448 --> 39:58.938
Despite ourselves,
despite what everyone's told us,

39:58.963 --> 40:00.149
but we can't just...

40:04.018 --> 40:06.119
I think about William, Beth.

40:06.778 --> 40:08.392
William before we knew him.

40:08.780 --> 40:10.712
He was lost, alone,

40:11.352 --> 40:12.688
missing me...

40:14.291 --> 40:15.462
...needing me.

40:15.561 --> 40:16.649
Coming.

40:25.080 --> 40:26.914
Yeah, stop all that banging.

40:26.938 --> 40:29.392
I heard you the first time.
Who the hell is knocking...

40:29.417 --> 40:30.775
My name is Randall Pearson.

40:30.800 --> 40:32.149
I'm your biological son.

40:32.471 --> 40:34.147
36 years ago, you left me at the...

40:35.885 --> 40:37.360
Ready for night-night?

40:37.385 --> 40:38.774
I think of my parents...

40:40.079 --> 40:42.181
Oh, my sweet, sweet man.

40:42.206 --> 40:44.157
...fiercely protecting me,

40:44.431 --> 40:45.767
wondering for their whole life

40:45.792 --> 40:47.134
if they did right by me.

40:51.485 --> 40:53.829
I think about all those people
making choices

40:53.854 --> 40:56.774
about my life before I could
make choices for myself.

40:57.734 --> 40:59.259
Do anything good lately?

41:02.134 --> 41:03.220
I don't know.

41:04.896 --> 41:05.907
You?

41:06.210 --> 41:07.345
No idea.

41:13.195 --> 41:15.087
And now we're those people, Beth.

41:15.809 --> 41:17.943
We're the adults making
complicated choices

41:17.968 --> 41:19.556
about that little girl's life.

41:21.306 --> 41:23.727
Beth, I gave Shauna our number.

41:25.591 --> 41:27.415
I told her to call collect.

41:27.555 --> 41:29.110
She's calling Deja tonight.

41:29.135 --> 41:31.110
Hey, it's me.

41:31.984 --> 41:33.837
How you doing?
