THROW SOME PAINT UP ON 'EM.

DECORATED THE PLACE FOR HER,

AND FROWNY.
OH, OKAY. I'M GONNA
STOP YOU RIGHT THERE,

04:22.563 --> 04:24.264
'CAUSE YANG DOESN'T DECORATE.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.397

ITS WAY TO THE SURFACE.

IN PEOPLE ALL THE TIME.

DOES IT HURT?
UH, NOPE.

DOES IT HURT
WHEN I DO THIS?
OW! DAMN!

05:05.736 --> 05:07.408
IT IS NOT FINE.

05:07.408 --> 05:10.040
IT IS FOREIGN, AND IT HAS
NO BUSINESS BEING IN YOUR BODY.

05:10.040 --> 05:13.083
GET IT OUT, KAREV, OR I'LL SEE
TO IT THAT YOU WON'T OPERATE

05:13.083 --> 05:14.745
UNTIL YOU'RE OPERATED ON.

05:17.317 --> 05:18.819
YOU DISAGREE WITH HIM?

05:18.819 --> 05:21.492
NO. KEEPING RESIDENTS OUT OF
THE O.R. UNTIL THEY'RE READY

05:21.492 --> 05:24.495

OF THEM, BUT NOT FOR CRISTINA.
(Teddy) SHE WON'T FEEL
LIKE HERSELF

I DO.

05:28.629 --> 05:31.331

AN EX VIVO HEART RECONSTRUCTION?

05:31.331 --> 05:33.934

A ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME--
IT IS A HELL OF A LOT
OF PRESSURE

05:33.934 --> 05:35.936
IS WHAT IT IS.
WELL, SHE OPERATED ON--

05:35.936 --> 05:38.769
I MEAN, SHE SAVED DEREK SHEPHERD
WITH A GUN TO HER HEAD.

05:38.769 --> 05:40.941
I DON'T THINK THAT PRESSURE
IS THE ISSUE FOR HER.

05:40.941 --> 05:44.645
WE OWE HER THIS, RICHARD,
AND SHE NEEDS IT.

05:44.645 --> 05:46.647
PUT HER BACK IN THE GAME.

FROM HER HEART.

05:53.954 --> 05:58.128

THAT AGAIN.
NO, BY REMOVING BOTH ATRIA,

05:58.128 --> 05:59.990
AND HOPEFULLY
ALL THE CANCEROUS CELLS,

05:59.990 --> 06:02.062

KEEP COMING BACK HERE.

06:09.139 --> 06:13.003
YOU ASSISTED ON HER LAST
MYXOMA REMOVAL.
OF COURSE. OF COURSE. HI.

06:13.003 --> 06:15.746
YOU WERE GETTING MARRIED,
WEREN'T YOU?
SORRY?

06:15.746 --> 06:18.979

LAST NIGHT, ACTUALLY.

06:51.512 --> 06:54.084

THREE WITH VISION LOSS,

AND ONE DISLOCATED HIP.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.431
EXPLOSION?
CAR WRECK?

07:11.431 --> 07:13.103
UH, ACT OF GOD.
ACT OF GOD?

07:13.103 --> 07:14.965
YEAH, LIGHTNING STRIKE.
ALL THAT
FROM ONE LIGHTNING STRIKE?

07:14.965 --> 07:16.767
ONE LIGHTNING STRIKE,
EIGHT VICTIMS.

07:16.767 --> 07:19.009
TOOK OUT
A WHOLE FLAG FOOTBALL TEAM.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.562
HOW DID IT STRIKE
ALL OF 'EM?

07:41.562 --> 07:43.564
WELL, THEY'RE MOSTLY
FLASH BURNS,

07:43.564 --> 07:45.566
SO IT PROBABLY HIT ONE OF THEM

07:45.566 --> 07:48.499
THEN CONDUCTED OFF
ONTO THE REST.

07:48.499 --> 07:49.840
LEXIE.

07:49.840 --> 07:53.003
T.M. RUPTURE, TRAUMA ONE.

07:53.003 --> 07:55.475
I'LL SEE YOU IN THERE.

07:55.475 --> 07:58.679
(indistinct conversations)

07:58.679 --> 08:00.050
TELL ME SOMETHING.
HMM.

08:00.050 --> 08:03.153
WHEN A PERSON GETS OUT
OF THE NUT HOUSE...
MM-HMM.

08:03.153 --> 08:06.016
WHAT'S THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF
TIME TO WAIT BEFORE YOU PROPOSE?

08:06.016 --> 08:08.659
(elevator bell dings)
(laughs) WHAT? LONG.

08:08.659 --> 08:11.762
LONGER. LONG--A LONG TIME.

08:11.762 --> 08:13.664
NOT NOW.

08:13.664 --> 08:15.165
SPECIFICALLY, HOW LONG?

08:15.165 --> 08:17.167
HAVE YOU SEEN MY FRIEND KERRY?

08:17.167 --> 08:19.229
SHE'S--SHE'S A GIRL.
SH-SHE'S THE ONLY GIRL.

08:19.229 --> 08:21.231
WHOA. WHOA.
YOU'VE JUST GOT
SOME FERNING HERE.

08:21.231 --> 08:23.774
IT'S SUPERFICIAL. IT'S WHERE
THE ELECTRONS ENTERED THE SKIN.

08:23.774 --> 08:26.176
WELL, WHAT ABOUT MY ARM?
I STILL CAN'T FEEL MY ARM.

08:26.176 --> 08:27.878
SIT FORWARD.
HI.

08:27.878 --> 08:29.179
UH, HI. YOU CHANGED.

08:29.179 --> 08:31.141
YEAH, AND SHOWERED, TWICE,
THANKS TO YOU.

08:31.141 --> 08:33.013
THIS IS RUSS.
UH-HUH.

08:33.013 --> 08:35.515
HE WAS STRUCK BY LIGHTNING
WHILE PLAYING FLAG FOOTBALL,

08:35.515 --> 08:38.518
AND HE'S COMPLAINING
OF PARALYSIS IN HIS LEFT ARM.
CAN YOU MOVE
YOUR FINGERS FOR ME?

08:38.518 --> 08:41.191
YEAH, SEE, I COULDN'T DO THAT
WHEN I FIRST GOT HERE.

08:41.191 --> 08:43.193
IT'S PROBABLY
JUST TRANSITORY PARALYSIS,

08:43.193 --> 08:45.996
WHICH IS COMMON WITH LIGHTNING
STRIKES. CAN YOU FEEL THAT?
LITTLE BIT, YEAH.

08:45.996 --> 08:47.297
WE'RE GONNA
KEEP WATCHING YOU,

08:47.297 --> 08:50.601
BUT YOUR ARM SHOULD COME BACK
TO NORMAL IN A COUPLE OF HOURS.

08:50.601 --> 08:54.004
YOU KNOW THEY ALMOST REVOKED
MY DRIVER'S LICENSE?
CAN SOMEBODY
PLEASE CHECK ON KERRY FOR ME?

08:54.004 --> 08:57.037
HAPPY TO. RIGHT AWAY.
HEY, WE'RE STILL NOT DONE
TALKING ABOUT THIS.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.038
MM.

08:58.038 --> 09:00.110
(Callie) OKAY,
WIGGLE YOUR TOES FOR ME.

09:00.110 --> 09:03.113
I STILL CAN'T. AM I GONNA
BE IN A WHEELCHAIR?

09:03.113 --> 09:05.676
WE'RE GONNA TAKE YOU IN
FOR A C.T.,

09:05.676 --> 09:08.278
BUT HOPEFULLY, IT IS JUST
TEMPORARY, FROM THE LIGHTNING.

09:08.278 --> 09:10.320
COUPLE OF YOUR FRIENDS
HAVE IT, TOO.

09:10.320 --> 09:13.153
THEY'RE ALREADY STARTING
TO GET SOME FEELING BACK.
OKAY.

09:13.153 --> 09:15.926
TRY NOT TO WORRY.
HEY, KERRY. A FRIEND OF YOURS,
RUSS GAMMIE,

09:15.926 --> 09:20.090
IS ASKING ABOUT YOU.
HOW'S WARREN GRIFFITH?
IS HE OKAY? DID HE ASK ABOUT ME?

09:20.090 --> 09:22.593
WHICH ONE IS WARREN?
EXCUSE ME. EXCUSE ME. I--

09:22.593 --> 09:24.595
WHO'S THIS,
RUSS OR WARREN?
MITCH?

09:24.595 --> 09:25.896
MITCH NOW?

09:25.896 --> 09:28.739
HEY, HAVE YOU SEEN WARREN?
IS HE OKAY?

09:28.739 --> 09:30.040
KERRY, I GOTTA SAY THIS.

09:30.040 --> 09:32.202
WE BOTH COULD'VE DIED
OUT THERE.

09:32.202 --> 09:35.075
THAT LIGHTNING BOLT WAS LIKE
A ONE-IN-A-MILLION SHOT,

09:35.075 --> 09:37.808
SO I GOTTA TAKE ONE, TOO.

09:37.808 --> 09:40.811
I LOVE YOU, KERRY,
AND IF WE GET THROUGH THIS,

09:40.811 --> 09:42.613
I WANT YOU TO KNOW,

09:42.613 --> 09:44.615
I WILL LOVE YOU FOREVER.

09:47.587 --> 09:50.220
WHAT?

09:50.220 --> 09:51.992
WH--

09:51.992 --> 09:54.264
SIR, I'M SORRY.
IF YOU'RE NOT BEING TREATED,

09:54.264 --> 09:56.697
THEN YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO
TO THE WAITING ROOM.

09:56.697 --> 09:59.169
WE'LL--WE'LL KEEP YOU POSTED.
(singsongy) KERRY,
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

09:59.169 --> 10:01.171
YEAH, I CAN HEAR YOU FINE.

10:01.171 --> 10:04.104
I JUST DIDN'T WANT HIM
TO KNOW THAT I HEARD THAT.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.976
YOU'RE A POPULAR GIRL.

10:05.976 --> 10:07.978
NO. I'M SURE
HE'S JUST OVEREXCITED.

10:07.978 --> 10:10.010
IT IS LIKE
A ONE-IN-A-MILLION THING.

10:10.010 --> 10:13.313
ACTUALLY, IT'S MORE LIKE
A 1-IN-6,250 KIND OF THING.

10:13.313 --> 10:16.116
LIGHTNING KILLS BETWEEN 150
TO 300 PEOPLE EVERY YEAR

10:16.116 --> 10:19.089
IN THE U.S. ALONE.
LEXIE.

10:19.089 --> 10:21.151
WELL, NO, I MEAN, IT'S--
IT'S STILL RARE.

10:21.151 --> 10:24.154
I MEAN, IT'S NOT, LIKE,
SAY, HANDGUN DEATH.

10:24.154 --> 10:26.226
I MEAN, THAT'S--THAT'S
1 IN 325.
LEXIE.

10:26.226 --> 10:28.198
YOU OKAY?

10:28.198 --> 10:30.701
YEAH. NO, I'M SAYING--
I'M SAYING SHE'S LUCKY.

10:30.701 --> 10:33.633
THAT'S... YOU KNOW,
HEY, YAY, YOU.

10:33.633 --> 10:36.206
CAN SOMEONE JUST PLEASE
CHECK ON WARREN FOR ME?

10:36.206 --> 10:39.139
I NEED TO KNOW IF HE'S OKAY.
IS WARREN YOUR BOYFRIEND?

10:39.139 --> 10:41.171
NO. HE'S...

10:41.171 --> 10:43.243
NO.

10:43.243 --> 10:45.716
OKAY.

10:45.716 --> 10:47.878
WELL, YOU'VE GOT
TWO BURST EARDRUMS,

10:47.878 --> 10:50.120
BUT THEY WILL
HEAL THEMSELVES, TOO.
GREAT. THANK YOU.

10:50.120 --> 10:52.953
DOES THAT MEAN
THERE'S NO SURGERY? CAN I GO?

10:52.953 --> 10:56.356
'CAUSE DR. SHEPHERD'S HERE,
SO HE MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING.
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
STICK WITH ME.

10:56.356 --> 10:59.129
KERRY WILL NEED A WORKUP.
(snaps glove)

10:59.129 --> 11:02.192
I'M SORRY. WHY IS THIS BETTER
THAN WHAT DR. BURKE DID?

11:02.192 --> 11:05.936
DR. BURKE'S APPROACH
WAS CONSERVATIVE AND CORRECT

11:05.936 --> 11:07.938
FOR THE FIRST FEW SURGERIES.

11:07.938 --> 11:10.300
THIS IS RADICAL AND RISKY,
BUT--

11:10.300 --> 11:13.203
WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE
IT'S GONNA KILL HER.

11:13.203 --> 11:16.046
LINDA'S HEART WALL HAS GROWN
WEAKER WITH EVERY SURGERY,

11:16.046 --> 11:18.048
SO THERE ARE GREATER ODDS
OF CARDIAC RUPTURE.

11:18.048 --> 11:20.050
THIS MAY BE
HER LAST CHANCE.

11:20.050 --> 11:22.052
(thunder rumbling)

11:22.052 --> 11:24.354
PAUL...
HONEY, EVERY TWO YEARS,

11:24.354 --> 11:27.017
WE COME HERE,
THEY CUT ME OPEN,

11:27.017 --> 11:30.020
AND I WATCH IT TAKE
TEN YEARS OFF OF YOUR LIFE.

11:30.020 --> 11:32.723
I CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE.

11:32.723 --> 11:34.224
AND NEITHER CAN YOU.

11:34.224 --> 11:36.196
(rumbling continues)

11:36.196 --> 11:38.068
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

11:38.068 --> 11:41.401
DO YOU THINK
THIS IS THE BEST IDEA?

11:41.401 --> 11:43.173
OH, I'M NOT, UM--

11:43.173 --> 11:45.876
BECAUSE WHAT YOU
AND DR. BURKE DID,

11:45.876 --> 11:48.078
IT'S KEPT HER WITH ME
SO FAR.

11:48.078 --> 11:51.711
IF THIS WAS YOUR HUSBAND,
WOULD YOU LET DR. ALTMAN

11:51.711 --> 11:55.145
TEAR APART HIS HEART?

11:59.449 --> 12:01.091
YES.

12:01.091 --> 12:03.493
AN AGGRESSIVE APPROACH
IS YOUR ONLY OPTION.

12:03.493 --> 12:05.295
THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT.

12:05.295 --> 12:07.497
(exhales deeply)

12:07.497 --> 12:12.062
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

12:13.964 --> 12:15.435
OKAY.

12:15.435 --> 12:18.108
ALL RIGHT.

12:18.108 --> 12:19.409
(Teddy) OKAY.

12:19.409 --> 12:22.242
WE'LL SEE YOU IN THERE.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.845
(thunder rumbles)

12:24.845 --> 12:27.077
(clears throat) MM.
(elevator bell dings)

12:27.077 --> 12:29.119
OH.
(whiny voice) WHAT ARE THESE?

12:29.119 --> 12:31.151
CHOICES.

12:31.151 --> 12:32.522
THEY'RE ALL BEIGE.

12:32.522 --> 12:34.224
NO, THEY'RE ALL SUBTLE.

12:34.224 --> 12:37.187
LOOK,
PASTELS AND EARTH TONES.

12:37.187 --> 12:38.889
IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY,

12:38.889 --> 12:41.131
THAT'S BLUE, THAT'S GREEN,
THAT'S YELLOW--

12:41.131 --> 12:43.133
TO TAKE THE EDGE OFF
ALL THE CHROME AND CONCRETE.

12:43.133 --> 12:45.135
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
(normal voice) I THINK

12:45.135 --> 12:48.138
I DON'T WANT TO LIVE
IN AN EASTER BASKET.
I KNOW.

12:48.138 --> 12:50.500
YOU REALLY WANT
TO LIVE IN THE BATCAVE.

12:50.500 --> 12:52.472
BUT MEET ME HALFWAY.
UH, YES.

12:52.472 --> 12:55.375
SCHULTZ, KERRY?
YES, THANK YOU.

12:55.375 --> 12:57.477
OKAY, UH, MY PATIENT'S SCANS
ARE UP.

12:57.477 --> 13:00.410
AND, UH, SERIOUSLY...

13:00.410 --> 13:02.252
THEY'RE ALL BEIGE TO ME.

13:02.252 --> 13:06.156
W-WELL, THEN IT SHOULDN'T BE
HARD TO PICK ONE.

13:06.156 --> 13:07.858
I'M LOOKING
FOR WARREN GRIFFITH.

13:07.858 --> 13:09.289
THAT'S ME.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.291
OH. I FEEL KIND OF QUEASY.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.423
YOU'VE GOT A LITTLE FEVER.
THAT MAY BE WHY.

13:13.423 --> 13:16.096
YOU GOT HIT THE HARDEST.
LOOKS LIKE IT WENT

13:16.096 --> 13:18.198
INTO YOUR NECK
AND CAME OUT YOUR FOOT.
AND YOU'RE SAYING
IT BOUNCED OFF ME

13:18.198 --> 13:21.131
AND HIT EVERYONE ELSE?
I TOOK OUT THE WHOLE TEAM?

13:21.131 --> 13:23.103
IT'S NOT LIKE
IT'S YOUR FAULT.

13:23.103 --> 13:26.106
IT KINDA FEELS THAT WAY.
I DON'T REMEMBER ANY OF IT.

13:26.106 --> 13:29.439
HOW ABOUT MY FRIEND KERRY?
IS SHE OKAY?
SHE'S WONDERING
THE SAME THING ABOUT YOU.

13:29.439 --> 13:32.242
SHE WHAT?
SHE ASKED ABOUT ME?

13:32.242 --> 13:34.915
SPECIFICALLY?

13:34.915 --> 13:36.286
WELL, WHAT DID SHE SAY?

13:36.286 --> 13:38.518
ARE YOU PEOPLE
IN JUNIOR HIGH?

13:38.518 --> 13:41.151
I ALMOST TOLD HER.
I TRIED TO. I...

13:41.151 --> 13:43.994
I'M GONNA TELL HER.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

13:43.994 --> 13:46.526
KERRY. I TRIED TO TELL HER
I-I LOVE HER, BUT HER--

13:46.526 --> 13:48.358
HER EARS ARE ALL MESSED UP
AND--
AH!

13:48.358 --> 13:50.430
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
YOU GOTTA SIT DOWN.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

13:50.430 --> 13:53.203
I GOTTA TELL HER.
I GET TO TELL HER.
G-GUYS, LOOK,

13:53.203 --> 13:55.435
LEAVE HER ALONE. ALL RIGHT?
SHE COULDA DIED OUT THERE.

13:55.435 --> 13:59.209
AND BESIDES,
SHE'S, LIKE, MINE.

13:59.209 --> 14:02.842
NO, I'VE BEEN WORKING UP
TO THIS FOR A YEAR.
(Alex) NO, NO, NO,
YOU'VE GOTTA SIT.

14:02.842 --> 14:05.175
SHE'S MINE, AND I LOVE HER.
I'VE BEEN WORKING UP TO THIS
FOR A YEAR.

14:05.175 --> 14:07.247
(Alex) YOU NEED TO
COME BACK HERE AND SIT DOWN!
POPULAR GIRL.

14:07.247 --> 14:09.219
OH, MY GOD. THANK YOU.

14:09.219 --> 14:11.421
YEP, C.T. LOOKS CLEAR.
NO DAMAGE TO YOUR SPINE.

14:11.421 --> 14:14.184
(lowered voice)
WHICH MEANS I CAN GO?
IT MEANS
YOU SHOULD OBSERVE HER.

14:14.184 --> 14:16.426
(men arguing)

14:16.426 --> 14:20.230
WHOA. HEY!
(men all talking at once)

14:20.230 --> 14:23.333
(Meredith) GUYS,
YOU CAN'T BE IN HERE.
(men continue talking)

14:23.333 --> 14:26.466
EVERYBODY, SHUT UP.
SHUT UP.

14:26.466 --> 14:29.469
(talking stops)

14:29.469 --> 14:32.202
OKAY, WARREN. YOU TALK.

14:32.202 --> 14:33.643
OH.

14:33.643 --> 14:37.647
KERRY, I...

14:39.309 --> 14:42.252
(coughs and groans)

14:42.252 --> 14:44.114
OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD!

14:44.114 --> 14:47.357
PAGE BAILEY!
(doctors all talking at once)

14:55.065 --> 14:57.067
WARREN,
YOU HAVE A PERFORATION--

14:57.067 --> 14:59.069
A HOLE--
SOMEWHERE IN YOUR BOWEL.

14:59.069 --> 15:01.371
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO TAKE YOU
UP TO SURGERY.
TELL KERRY I'M SORRY.

15:01.371 --> 15:03.934
TELL HER I'M SORRY
I HIT HER WITH LIGHTNING.
HEY, DON'T YOU WORRY.

15:03.934 --> 15:06.536
NO, SHE'S JUST THE SWEETEST,
FUNNIEST--SHE'S JUST--

15:06.536 --> 15:10.510
JUST PLEASE MAKE SURE
SHE'S OKAY.
OKAY. WE WILL. WE'RE GONNA
TAKE CARE OF YOU NOW.

15:10.510 --> 15:12.512
ALL RIGHT, WHO DO I HAVE?
WHO'S FREE?

15:12.512 --> 15:15.415
I'M FREE. I'M GOOD. I'LL GO.
HE'S MY PATIENT.
I'LL TAKE HIM.

15:15.415 --> 15:17.087
(sighs)

15:17.087 --> 15:19.089
OW!
BOOK AN O.R.
YOU CAN OBSERVE.

15:19.089 --> 15:21.321
I'M FINE, AND I'M FREE.

15:21.321 --> 15:22.252
OH--

15:22.252 --> 15:25.255
B--WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
NOTHING.

15:25.255 --> 15:27.297
(sighs) OTHER GREY,
ARE YOU FREE TO SCRUB IN?

15:27.297 --> 15:29.629
ABSOLUTELY. I--
I'M AVAILABLE,

15:29.629 --> 15:31.631
'CAUSE YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
CLEARED FOR SURGERY, RIGHT?

15:31.631 --> 15:33.633
APRIL, IF WE'RE
GONNA BE FRIENDS...

15:33.633 --> 15:36.706
(whispers)
YOU HAVE TO STOP DOING THAT.
(whispers) SORRY. HABIT.

15:36.706 --> 15:39.209
I'M STANDING RIGHT HERE.
KEPNER, GO PREP HIM.

15:39.209 --> 15:41.941
OKAY.
I'LL SEE YOU UP THERE.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.713
I'M FINE.

15:43.713 --> 15:46.716
WELL, GREAT. THEN YOU CAN
KEEP AN EYE ON KERRY.

15:46.716 --> 15:49.279
(Teddy)
I'LL RESECT BOTH ATRIA...
(beeping)

15:49.279 --> 15:52.622
AND BUILD NEW ONES
OUT OF BOVINE PERICARDIUM.

15:52.622 --> 15:54.254
AND DURING RECONSTRUCTION,

15:54.254 --> 15:58.158
DR. HUNT WILL STAY WITH LINDA,
USING A HUMAN DONOR AORTA

15:58.158 --> 16:00.490
TO PREPARE THE VESSELS
FOR REIMPLANTATION.

16:00.490 --> 16:02.492
AND ALL OF THIS
IN JUST FOUR HOURS?

16:02.492 --> 16:05.195
WE HAVE TO BE FAST.
WE ALL SET?

16:05.195 --> 16:06.666
LET'S GO.

16:06.666 --> 16:09.569
ALL RIGHT. PREP HER
AND PAGE ME WHEN SHE'S READY.

16:09.569 --> 16:11.241
SURE.

16:13.343 --> 16:16.046
CRISTINA.

16:16.046 --> 16:18.348
ARE YOU EXCITED?

16:18.348 --> 16:19.709
YES, ABSOLUTELY.

16:19.709 --> 16:21.251
GOOD. GOOD.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.154
(beep)

16:24.154 --> 16:25.685
(door closes)

16:25.685 --> 16:27.217
(beep)

16:29.659 --> 16:31.321
(beep)

16:31.321 --> 16:35.365
THE FEAR OF GOING BACK IN IS
WORSE THAN ACTUALLY DOING IT.

16:35.365 --> 16:38.368
IT'S JUST GETTING BACK
ON THE HORSE IS ALL IT IS.

16:49.509 --> 16:54.344
THIS IS ONE HELL
OF A HONEYMOON, RIGHT?

16:54.344 --> 16:56.346
(chuckles)

16:58.088 --> 17:00.750
INCISION LOOKS GREAT.

17:00.750 --> 17:03.753
HEY, I HEAR YOU AND TORRES
ARE SHACKING UP.

17:03.753 --> 17:05.595
UH, UH, YEAH.

17:05.595 --> 17:08.398
DO I SOUND MORE EXCITED
THAN YOU?

17:08.398 --> 17:10.300
NO, NO. I AM. I AM.

17:10.300 --> 17:14.234
HOW'S IT GOING WITH THE HOT,
HOT TRAUMA COUNSELOR?

17:14.234 --> 17:16.566
I HAVE TO SAY...

17:16.566 --> 17:18.268
IT'S GREAT.

17:18.268 --> 17:20.270
THE CONVERSATION
NEVER STOPS,

17:20.270 --> 17:23.713
AND I FEEL, UM...

17:23.713 --> 17:25.345
I DON'T KNOW.

17:25.345 --> 17:27.717
I FEEL GOOD
WHENEVER I SEE HIM.

17:27.717 --> 17:29.379
NO HEART MURMUR. GOOD GIRL.

17:29.379 --> 17:32.051
WHAT DO YOU TALK ABOUT?
WHAT'S HE LIKE?

17:32.051 --> 17:35.255
HE'S, UM...
WELL, HE LIKES TO, UH...

17:35.255 --> 17:38.057
(chuckles)
I GUESS I-I MOSTLY TALK,

17:38.057 --> 17:41.191
AND HE MOSTLY LISTENS.

17:41.191 --> 17:44.334
HE'S--HE'S
AN AMAZINGLY GOOD LISTENER.

17:44.334 --> 17:47.197
WELL, HE SHOULD BE.
IT'S WHAT HE GETS PAID FOR.

17:47.197 --> 17:49.699
(chuckles) YEAH.

17:49.699 --> 17:53.243
(baby coos)

17:53.243 --> 17:54.544
WARREN?

17:54.544 --> 17:56.376
YOU LOVE WARREN?

17:56.376 --> 17:58.178
WARREN'S BALD, KERRY.

17:58.178 --> 18:00.280
I KNOW THAT, MITCH.

18:00.280 --> 18:03.353
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

18:03.353 --> 18:05.355
YOU GUYS DON'T LOVE ME.

18:05.355 --> 18:08.087
I'M A GIRL WHO'S DOWN
WITH FLAG FOOTBALL,

18:08.087 --> 18:10.089
SO YOU THINK YOU LOVE ME.

18:10.089 --> 18:12.222
(crying) PLUS,
WE GOT STRUCK BY LIGHTNING,

18:12.222 --> 18:13.793
SO THAT'S...

18:13.793 --> 18:16.626
NICE.
YOU MADE HER CRY.

18:16.626 --> 18:18.528
OH, CRAP. YOU KNOW, SORRY.

18:18.528 --> 18:20.330
YOU KNOW,
WARREN'S A GOOD GUY.

18:20.330 --> 18:23.373
HE COULD PROBABLY GET
A HAIRPIECE OR SOMETHING AND--
(sobs)

18:23.373 --> 18:25.335
SHE'S CRYING
BECAUSE EVERYTHING'S CHANGED.

18:25.335 --> 18:29.179
OKAY? LIGHTNING STRUCK,
AND EVERYTHING CHANGED.

18:29.179 --> 18:30.480
YOU WERE HER TEAM.

18:30.480 --> 18:33.343
