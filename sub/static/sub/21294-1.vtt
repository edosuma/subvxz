Oh, man, it was
fucking beautiful.

01:27:16.632 --> 01:27:19.502

* You've fallen
and you can't get up *

01:27:50.599 --> 01:27:52.935
* Well, all the doubters
and the shouters *

01:27:52.968 --> 01:27:56.038

I thought we gave
a very moving performance.

01:28:23.499 --> 01:28:26.502
The only thing moving
was your lips.
