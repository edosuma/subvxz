WEBVTT

00:55.958 --> 00:57.416
<i>Why do we die?</i>

01:00.125 --> 01:01.416
<i>What is death?</i>

01:01.500 --> 01:03.500
TIEDEMANN, REGINA
AUGUST 1, 1971 - SEPTEMBER 2, 2019

01:03.583 --> 01:04.583
MOM AND SISTER
CAVE

01:04.666 --> 01:07.500
<i>Could we escape it</i>
<i>if we knew when to expect it?</i>

01:11.583 --> 01:15.291
<i>Is the time</i>
<i>of our departure predetermined?</i>

01:18.000 --> 01:21.375
<i>Our dying, part of an endless clockwork?</i>

01:25.208 --> 01:27.625
<i>We all have one truth in common.</i>

01:28.916 --> 01:30.708
<i>We are born.</i>

01:30.791 --> 01:32.041
<i>And we die.</i>

01:37.791 --> 01:41.041
<i>No matter what path we take in between.</i>

03:13.541 --> 03:18.166
LIFE AND DEATH

03:20.250 --> 03:23.000
Your path will always lead you here.

03:25.708 --> 03:27.208
To Elisabeth.

03:28.083 --> 03:29.291
To me.

03:31.083 --> 03:33.291
Time plays a cruel game.

03:42.458 --> 03:44.166
Have you made your decision?

03:47.541 --> 03:49.208
Just one more day

03:50.833 --> 03:53.666
and we can untie this knot
once and for all.

03:55.750 --> 03:56.875
But you must,

03:58.083 --> 03:59.125
as all of us,

04:00.625 --> 04:02.625
do your part.

04:06.250 --> 04:08.208
Will you see it through?

04:12.666 --> 04:15.208
Eva will never achieve her goal.

04:20.166 --> 04:23.625
Her world doesn't deserve to be saved

04:24.500 --> 04:26.000
any more than ours does.

04:30.083 --> 04:35.708
ONE DAY UNTIL THE APOCALYPSE

06:21.083 --> 06:22.333
We have to go.

06:22.416 --> 06:23.750
To the nuclear power plant.

06:23.833 --> 06:25.041
We don't have much time.

06:31.333 --> 06:32.333
Jonas?

06:43.750 --> 06:44.750
Never mind.

06:58.625 --> 07:00.291
My God, where were you?

07:02.625 --> 07:04.625
We were looking for you all day yesterday.

07:05.625 --> 07:09.666
Kilian said you were with him
and then you just vanished into thin air.

07:12.833 --> 07:14.333
And who are you?

07:36.375 --> 07:37.708
Everything will be okay.

07:48.833 --> 07:50.125
What's wrong?

07:56.916 --> 07:58.416
I have to go now.

08:26.625 --> 08:28.041
Wait at the entrance.

08:28.916 --> 08:31.375
I'll get you out of here tonight at ten.

08:31.458 --> 08:35.500
And if anyone asks what you're doing,
say you couldn't sleep.

08:43.708 --> 08:46.125
My mother changes shifts at 5:00 p.m.

08:46.208 --> 08:47.708
She has a keycard.

08:48.500 --> 08:50.458
She always takes the same route.

08:58.625 --> 09:00.333
We'll bring Mikkel back.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.250
I promise.

09:06.750 --> 09:08.041
I promise.

09:13.166 --> 09:14.791
I'm sorry.

09:16.416 --> 09:17.791
For everything.

09:23.166 --> 09:27.000
<i>One year</i>
<i>after the horrific events in Chernobyl,</i>

09:27.083 --> 09:32.125
<i>five high-ranking employees at the reactor</i>
<i>have been given long prison sentences.</i>

09:32.208 --> 09:38.083
<i>Meanwhile, German nuclear power plants</i>
<i>have seen increased safety inspections.</i>

09:38.166 --> 09:41.125
Oh, Charlotte. You're back already?

09:41.208 --> 09:43.500
<i>...that German nuclear power plants</i>
<i>are safe.</i>

09:43.583 --> 09:44.583
<i>USA.</i>

09:44.666 --> 09:46.791
<i>German Foreign Affairs Minister</i>
<i>Hans-Dietrich Genscher</i>

09:46.875 --> 09:50.833
<i>addressed the UN General Assembly</i>
<i>in New York</i>

09:50.916 --> 09:55.166
<i>and urged global superpowers to take</i>
<i>further steps towards disarmament.</i>

09:55.833 --> 09:56.791
<i>Bremerhaven.</i>

09:57.500 --> 10:01.625
<i>The German research vessel Polarstern</i>
<i>has set out to explore the Antarctic...</i>

10:01.708 --> 10:03.333
Bad day?

10:04.250 --> 10:07.083
<i>The expedition's aim</i>
<i>is to research the hole in the ozone.</i>

10:09.333 --> 10:12.791
Have you ever thought
whether it's possible to turn back time?

10:15.250 --> 10:16.250
Yes.

10:17.666 --> 10:19.166
Yes, I have.

10:21.583 --> 10:22.500
And?

10:23.166 --> 10:24.583
Do you think it's possible?

10:25.333 --> 10:27.750
That you can go back and change things?

10:34.250 --> 10:36.208
You're so grown up now.

10:39.541 --> 10:41.166
Grown up enough.

10:46.291 --> 10:49.500
For a long time now
I've wanted to be able to turn back time.

10:52.541 --> 10:54.666
But my place isn't in the past

10:55.250 --> 10:57.000
nor in the future.

10:59.875 --> 11:01.375
But here,

11:01.458 --> 11:02.708
with you.

11:11.583 --> 11:12.958
Are these my parents?

11:14.458 --> 11:16.291
You said there were no photos.

11:27.041 --> 11:29.041
That's not you.

11:31.125 --> 11:32.791
Those aren't your parents.

11:35.208 --> 11:37.500
That's my son and his wife.

11:39.541 --> 11:40.916
And my granddaughter.

11:45.875 --> 11:49.333
They died in a car accident.

11:49.416 --> 11:53.541
In the night, when it happened, I woke up.

11:53.625 --> 11:56.250
There was a noise downstairs in the shop.

11:58.708 --> 12:00.166
And two women were there.

12:01.458 --> 12:03.750
They looked peculiar.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.375
They were carrying a bundle.

12:09.916 --> 12:11.583
That bundle was you.

12:15.458 --> 12:16.875
They said

12:17.708 --> 12:21.833
that everything would be taken from me
that very night.

12:22.333 --> 12:25.166
And that at the same time,
I would be given everything.

12:29.333 --> 12:31.208
And then I got the call.

12:31.291 --> 12:32.708
On the bridge,

12:32.791 --> 12:37.833
a truck had forced my son's car
into the river.

12:39.541 --> 12:42.750
They only ever found
the bodies of my son and his wife.

12:42.833 --> 12:44.291
My granddaughter...

12:47.000 --> 12:48.625
was never found.

12:55.916 --> 12:57.833
This is the only thing

12:58.916 --> 13:00.750
that you had with you.

13:04.208 --> 13:06.875
FOR CHARLOTTE

13:13.708 --> 13:15.333
I don't understand this.

13:15.708 --> 13:17.208
Who are my parents?

13:22.458 --> 13:23.791
Charlotte...

13:25.125 --> 13:26.375
Who am I?

13:28.958 --> 13:30.500
I don't know.

13:32.166 --> 13:33.583
I don't know.

13:57.833 --> 14:00.333
-Charlotte?
-One of your colleagues let me in.

14:01.166 --> 14:03.333
I have questions about
the dead boy in the bunker.

14:03.416 --> 14:05.000
I hope that's okay.

14:12.875 --> 14:14.291
Are you all right?

14:16.916 --> 14:19.833
The planning meeting
for dismantling the facility.

14:20.875 --> 14:24.125
Everyone's getting nervous.
In a year this is all meant to be over.

14:26.041 --> 14:28.833
I never would have thought
it would end like this.

14:29.500 --> 14:30.583
But that's how it is.

14:32.666 --> 14:34.250
There's a time for everything.

14:37.750 --> 14:40.125
When exactly did you come to Winden?

14:44.458 --> 14:46.083
Fall of 1986.

14:46.916 --> 14:47.958
Why?

14:50.291 --> 14:52.458
And when did you start working here?

14:57.833 --> 14:59.541
Around the same time.

15:03.083 --> 15:04.791
So you got the shift schedules?

15:13.958 --> 15:18.125
I was wondering
if you archive the shift schedules.

15:19.375 --> 15:20.708
Long term.

15:24.333 --> 15:25.833
What month is this about?

15:26.750 --> 15:28.125
Not month.

15:30.958 --> 15:32.583
1986.

15:43.541 --> 15:46.583
POLICE

17:27.458 --> 17:28.791
Hello, Claudia.

18:24.333 --> 18:25.750
We need more men!

18:56.083 --> 18:57.583
Come on.

18:57.666 --> 18:59.916
We need to go.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.708
I'm not going with you.

19:04.375 --> 19:06.958
They're dead, Daddy.

19:08.916 --> 19:10.083
We haven't...

19:10.708 --> 19:13.250
found them.

19:14.291 --> 19:17.750
If they're alive,
why haven't they come back?

19:17.833 --> 19:20.458
Why aren't they looking for us?

19:23.083 --> 19:25.000
They're dead.

19:25.125 --> 19:27.375
Everyone here is dead.

19:33.125 --> 19:35.416
I don't want to do this anymore.

19:45.500 --> 19:49.416
POLICE

19:49.500 --> 19:51.208
You're from another world?

19:53.375 --> 19:54.666
What do you want here?

19:55.666 --> 19:57.875
I'm here to guide you into the light.

19:58.875 --> 20:00.750
There are two groups out there

20:00.833 --> 20:04.000
who are fighting
for supremacy in time travel.

20:05.333 --> 20:06.333
Light and shadow.

20:08.625 --> 20:11.041
I want you to join our side.

20:12.541 --> 20:14.250
Eva's side.

20:17.291 --> 20:18.500
Eva?

20:21.083 --> 20:23.916
You thought you could trust him,
but you can't.

20:26.333 --> 20:27.666
Who?

20:27.791 --> 20:28.750
Jonas.

20:31.708 --> 20:33.333
He belongs to the shadow.

20:34.458 --> 20:35.458
Jonas?

20:36.333 --> 20:37.541
He's dead.

20:38.583 --> 20:39.416
No.

20:40.416 --> 20:41.666
He's not.

20:42.500 --> 20:46.125
He wants to obliterate both worlds
and destroy the knot.

20:46.708 --> 20:49.875
He doesn't yet know
that's what he'll want in the end.

20:51.083 --> 20:54.458
But all the impulses
on his journey will lead him there.

20:55.625 --> 20:57.583
But Eva wants to save both worlds.

21:02.083 --> 21:03.458
I don't understand.

21:03.958 --> 21:06.416
Jonas said we could change it.

21:06.500 --> 21:09.666
We change one component,
which will change the entire world.

21:09.750 --> 21:11.875
That's what you told him.

21:13.250 --> 21:14.666
Your older self.

21:17.625 --> 21:19.333
A positive feedback loop.

21:20.208 --> 21:23.083
Jonas opened the passage in 2020.

21:23.791 --> 21:26.791
The older Jonas
had shut it prior to that, in 2019.

21:27.458 --> 21:30.583
After it had been opened
for the first time in the summer of 1986.

21:31.291 --> 21:35.166
All three times,
cesium residue was left behind.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.333
A component of the black matter.

21:41.750 --> 21:43.041
Radioactive half-lives.

21:43.958 --> 21:47.083
In each cycle, at all three moments,

21:47.958 --> 21:52.125
cesium is brought back into the tunnel
before it has fully decayed.

21:54.208 --> 21:56.583
It expands exponentially ad infinitum.

21:58.333 --> 22:00.750
So that's how the passage was created.

22:00.875 --> 22:03.375
And that's how it must continue
to exist for eternity.

22:04.666 --> 22:06.416
Everything has to happen again.

22:07.041 --> 22:09.583
Jonas bringing the matter
into the passage,

22:10.208 --> 22:13.958
the opening of one of the drums
in the plant triggering the apocalypse.

22:14.958 --> 22:17.375
Everything in this loop repeats itself.

22:19.708 --> 22:20.875
Life.

22:21.750 --> 22:23.000
And death.

22:30.375 --> 22:33.333
WARNING! SECURITY ZONE
NO TRESPASSING

22:43.625 --> 22:45.416
What exactly is in these barrels?

22:45.916 --> 22:47.333
I don't know.

22:50.916 --> 22:53.875
But something happened here
in the summer of 1986.

22:55.208 --> 22:57.000
An accident.

22:57.083 --> 22:58.958
And what remained,

22:59.583 --> 23:01.541
the substance in the barrels...

23:03.750 --> 23:06.333
That makes it possible
to travel through time.

23:09.916 --> 23:12.416
They're bringing the truck
with the barrels in today.

23:13.708 --> 23:15.375
We'll wait until nightfall.

23:29.625 --> 23:30.750
Oh, crap.

23:39.500 --> 23:41.000
It's fine. Just a scratch.

23:54.250 --> 23:55.916
What's wrong?

24:04.958 --> 24:06.166
That scratch.

24:08.333 --> 24:09.708
She had it.

24:12.750 --> 24:14.791
The Martha who brought me here.

24:17.916 --> 24:19.583
Everything repeats itself.

24:22.416 --> 24:24.000
She wanted to change it.

24:25.458 --> 24:28.458
But if you become her,
everything stays the same.

24:30.375 --> 24:31.958
Why did Eva lie?

24:33.125 --> 24:35.416
She said there was a way to save it.

24:37.291 --> 24:38.500
My world.

24:42.250 --> 24:46.416
I've got no idea about your world,
but this is my world.

24:46.500 --> 24:49.500
If I can stop the barrels being opened,
if it's possible to stop it all--

24:49.583 --> 24:51.500
And what if that's what she wants?

24:54.500 --> 24:56.041
For it all to happen again?

24:59.875 --> 25:01.875
Maybe she doesn't want us to stop it.

25:04.125 --> 25:05.958
Maybe it's us

25:06.750 --> 25:08.625
who trigger it in the first place.

25:12.166 --> 25:15.291
-Why would she want that?
-Because they're all lying!

25:17.208 --> 25:18.791
The entire time

25:18.875 --> 25:22.000
I've done
what the others have told me to do.

25:24.458 --> 25:26.708
And it just made everything worse.

25:30.416 --> 25:31.916
I have to go back to Eva.

25:33.041 --> 25:35.208
I finally want to know what the truth is.

25:40.791 --> 25:41.958
Jonas.

25:58.666 --> 26:00.166
Jonas, wait!

26:27.333 --> 26:29.625
You need a special invitation, or what?

26:31.875 --> 26:33.291
Coming or not?

26:46.958 --> 26:48.416
Excuse me.

26:48.500 --> 26:51.250
If I walk,
how long does it take to get to Winden?

26:52.541 --> 26:54.583
If I were you, I'd reconsider.

26:57.083 --> 26:58.708
Winden is like a black hole.

26:58.791 --> 27:00.916
Once you're there, you never get out.

27:14.750 --> 27:16.083
You all right?

27:20.083 --> 27:21.375
It's complicated.

27:27.291 --> 27:29.083
Almost everything is complicated.

27:36.500 --> 27:37.958
What are you doing here?

27:40.166 --> 27:41.416
It's complicated.

27:54.333 --> 27:55.833
My mother died.

27:57.958 --> 27:59.500
My father lives here.

28:02.166 --> 28:05.500
Until a few days ago,
I didn't even know who my father was.

28:09.250 --> 28:10.708
She told me.

28:12.625 --> 28:14.333
Shortly before she died.

28:24.583 --> 28:27.583
Do you believe it's possible
to bring someone back from the dead?

28:31.000 --> 28:32.541
How's that supposed to work?

28:35.458 --> 28:37.583
You have to get them before they die.

28:50.666 --> 28:51.666
I'm Peter.

28:53.958 --> 28:55.166
Charlotte.

29:04.083 --> 29:05.125
Peter?

29:07.833 --> 29:09.583
Back from school so early?

29:11.208 --> 29:12.708
I didn't go.

29:12.791 --> 29:14.541
What do you mean, you didn't go?

29:16.750 --> 29:18.291
What are you doing here?

29:20.666 --> 29:21.875
I saw Aleksander.

29:22.875 --> 29:25.583
The day Mads disappeared,
Helge was working at the plant.

29:26.375 --> 29:29.541
His shift ended at 6:00 p.m.
Mads disappeared at around 6:21 p.m.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.750
You're not serious, are you?

29:36.750 --> 29:39.125
I don't know why Helge said that.

29:39.208 --> 29:41.458
But he had nothing to do with Mads

29:41.541 --> 29:43.458
or with the boy you found.

29:44.041 --> 29:45.625
He was with us all evening.

29:45.708 --> 29:48.458
Your father may be involved in
the murders of two boys.

29:50.791 --> 29:53.875
-She's not deaf!
-Erik is still missing.

29:54.583 --> 29:56.583
This penny, what does it mean?

30:01.875 --> 30:03.541
Ulrich is right.

30:05.250 --> 30:07.541
It's all somehow connected.

30:13.125 --> 30:14.041
Ulrich?

30:17.250 --> 30:18.791
I have to go back to the office.

30:56.541 --> 30:57.916
Hey, wait.

31:07.625 --> 31:08.916
Don't be scared.

32:04.833 --> 32:06.250
Do you live here alone?

32:13.958 --> 32:15.541
I asked if you live alone.

32:54.958 --> 32:57.583
I've no idea when I last ate warm food.

37:51.708 --> 37:53.125
It's time.

37:55.541 --> 37:58.166
You have to let her go, Franziska.

39:09.791 --> 39:12.458
Adam can never be allowed
to untie that knot.

39:15.041 --> 39:16.458
You have to lead them.

39:17.208 --> 39:18.250
Jonas.

39:18.750 --> 39:19.833
Noah.

39:20.541 --> 39:21.875
Elisabeth.

39:25.833 --> 39:27.375
I don't understand.

39:29.875 --> 39:32.958
-Lead them where?
-Down the same path.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.291
Again and again.

39:36.333 --> 39:38.583
We have to preserve the knot.

39:38.958 --> 39:42.791
In your world you must do all you can
to do that, as I must in mine.

39:45.291 --> 39:47.958
Jonas. You'll have to guide him.

39:48.541 --> 39:50.625
And then later, defy him.

39:57.250 --> 40:00.000
-How will I know what I must do?
-It's all in there.

40:00.958 --> 40:02.291
We'll see each other again.

40:02.375 --> 40:03.458
In your world.

40:04.083 --> 40:05.291
Soon.

40:05.875 --> 40:07.208
Hold on, wait!

40:26.208 --> 40:27.291
Jonas?

40:29.041 --> 40:30.791
What if it's the truth?

40:37.083 --> 40:39.000
If there can only be one world.

40:41.666 --> 40:43.041
Yours or mine.

41:05.250 --> 41:06.750
You decided long ago.

41:17.666 --> 41:19.250
You want to go back.

41:20.958 --> 41:22.375
To your world.

41:35.083 --> 41:36.958
I didn't want any of this.

41:42.083 --> 41:43.625
You have to believe me.

41:49.625 --> 41:51.333
You didn't want any of this?

41:57.500 --> 41:58.791
Last night...

42:03.166 --> 42:04.750
You didn't want that?

42:16.500 --> 42:18.208
This is wrong.

42:23.000 --> 42:24.625
I'm wrong here.

43:08.333 --> 43:09.958
So this is wrong, huh?

44:21.250 --> 44:22.708
Are you following me?

44:24.375 --> 44:25.791
What do you want?

44:34.625 --> 44:36.000
The keycard.

44:37.333 --> 44:38.833
You're crazy.

44:39.375 --> 44:41.083
I don't want to hurt you.

44:41.791 --> 44:43.416
The keycard!

44:43.500 --> 44:47.041
I know you. I knew it right away,
that first day in the hospital.

44:47.541 --> 44:48.625
Where do I know you from?

44:57.625 --> 44:59.125
Mom, stop it!

45:02.708 --> 45:04.541
What did you say?

46:18.583 --> 46:20.416
I'm not your mother.

46:20.500 --> 46:22.291
You come from hell.

46:23.500 --> 46:25.000
The devil sent you.

46:25.083 --> 46:26.333
You're not real.

46:36.083 --> 46:37.416
I got rid of you.

46:38.541 --> 46:39.875
I got rid of you.

48:25.541 --> 48:27.333
Here. You go inside.

48:28.583 --> 48:30.125
I'll grab the rest.

49:01.666 --> 49:03.041
Right...

49:06.833 --> 49:08.333
Here we are again.

49:15.000 --> 49:17.041
Should I make us a hot chocolate?

49:20.250 --> 49:21.666
Or are you hungry?

49:25.958 --> 49:27.291
Michael?

49:28.666 --> 49:30.000
Are you hungry?

49:58.125 --> 50:00.000
Mom, is everything all right?

50:01.166 --> 50:02.375
You're bleeding!

50:13.625 --> 50:15.291
Mom, what happened?

50:18.375 --> 50:19.750
Mom, say something.

50:36.416 --> 50:37.875
What is that?

50:40.125 --> 50:41.416
Is that from Ulrich?

50:44.583 --> 50:45.916
You dirty little slut.

50:51.000 --> 50:53.375
You're not worthy
of the name you were given!

51:01.250 --> 51:03.541
I should have gotten rid of you too.

54:20.500 --> 54:22.083
What is this place?

54:33.125 --> 54:35.125
It is what will become of you.

54:42.166 --> 54:43.750
Adam and Eva.

54:58.458 --> 55:01.833
And thus everything starts over again.

55:05.375 --> 55:06.791
You lied.

55:08.708 --> 55:11.583
You said we could save both worlds,
but we can only save one.

55:12.375 --> 55:13.958
Or is that a lie too?

55:16.500 --> 55:18.000
I want to go back!

55:18.750 --> 55:19.958
Now!

55:20.041 --> 55:21.541
To my world!

55:31.291 --> 55:33.083
Of course you do.

55:35.500 --> 55:37.500
But there is no way back for you.

55:41.125 --> 55:42.541
What do you mean?

55:45.833 --> 55:48.958
A human being lives three lives.

55:51.458 --> 55:53.291
The first one ends

55:54.166 --> 55:57.458
with the loss of naiveté.

56:00.458 --> 56:01.833
The second...

56:02.916 --> 56:04.833
with the loss of innocence.

56:09.416 --> 56:10.666
And the third...

56:11.958 --> 56:14.125
with the loss of life itself.

56:28.250 --> 56:31.208
Yours ends here and now.

56:31.708 --> 56:32.916
What?

56:42.291 --> 56:47.125
You have accomplished
what you were sent to this world for.

56:47.666 --> 56:49.208
We've accomplished nothing.

56:49.708 --> 56:51.916
She said we had to stop the apocalypse.

56:52.375 --> 56:55.083
-The barrels in the power plant--
-You'll understand it all

56:55.541 --> 56:57.666
when it's time for you to understand.

57:36.666 --> 57:38.291
Who are you?

57:39.875 --> 57:41.375
I'm sorry.

57:48.208 --> 57:49.708
No. Jonas!

57:59.916 --> 58:02.041
Jonas, stay with me.

58:02.125 --> 58:03.541
Please, I can't...

58:45.875 --> 58:47.458
Please, Jonas.

58:50.250 --> 58:52.083
I'll make this right.

59:00.875 --> 59:02.333
No, no.
