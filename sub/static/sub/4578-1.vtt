- Oh !
- Hey. Hey, Miss Wittington.
What's goin' on ?

01:56.200 --> 01:58.577
- My house was broken into.
- No shit ?

01:58.619 --> 02:00.454
No shit.

02:00.537 --> 02:04.166
Hasn't anyone told ya ?

02:04.249 --> 02:06.919
Yeah, but they're all dead.

4946 Cypress Pond.

02:12.883 --> 02:15.010
Okay.
Right, thanks.

02:15.093 --> 02:17.763
They said to give 'em
15 minutes and they'll be by.

02:17.804 --> 02:21.141
- Jimmy, where are you going ?
- Check out your house.

02:21.183 --> 02:25.437
- No, wait for the police.
Where's the fun in that, huh ?

02:27.523 --> 02:29.816
- Are you coming ?

02:29.900 --> 02:33.278
Nah, l-l better stay
here and protect her.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.948
Oh-ho !
Right, dude.

02:35.989 --> 02:37.950
Good.

03:17.114 --> 03:20.242
All right, let's not anyone
mess with me here !

03:20.325 --> 03:22.411
Jimmy been suspended
five times this year already...

03:22.494 --> 03:26.540
for gettin' a little crazy
with the stick, all right ?

03:26.623 --> 03:28.542
Okay !

03:55.444 --> 03:58.697
Hoo. Shit.

04:28.685 --> 04:31.813
Shit !

04:33.398 --> 04:35.567
God.

04:41.448 --> 04:43.742
All right.

04:43.784 --> 04:46.787
Nothin' to fear.
The coast is clear.

04:46.828 --> 04:48.455
- You sure ?
- Yeah.

04:48.539 --> 04:51.583
- I checked all the rooms
and all the closets.
- Nothing's missing.

04:51.625 --> 04:55.754
I don't think so, but they,
uh, they did a real number
on your office.

04:55.796 --> 04:59.132
- My office ?
- Yeah, there's crap everywhere.

04:59.216 --> 05:04.054
Oh, and, uh, also they messed up
your kitchen really bad, too. Ick.

05:04.137 --> 05:06.139
Good night.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.896
So much for the cops.

05:26.285 --> 05:28.996
Perfect.

05:34.209 --> 05:38.547
- We got beer ! Yes !

05:38.630 --> 05:41.008
- We'll get messed up, man.

05:41.091 --> 05:43.010
I say we egg the house
across the street.

05:43.093 --> 05:45.012
- Shut up, dude.
- Why not ?

08:27.299 --> 08:30.469
- Looks like a prank.
- Andy ! Oh !

08:33.514 --> 08:35.724

08:39.811 --> 08:43.023

Hey, Bobby !

09:00.874 --> 09:02.876
What do ya got ?

09:02.960 --> 09:05.212
Looks like we hit
the Daily Double here.

09:05.295 --> 09:07.589
- What, another B and E ?
- Yeah.

09:25.357 --> 09:27.276
So, whose house is this, anyway ?

09:27.359 --> 09:30.445
Marion Wittington.
Dr. Sam Loomis's nurse ?

09:30.529 --> 09:32.614
He was that shrink
that died a few years ago.

09:32.698 --> 09:34.616
He lived here.
She took care of him.

09:34.700 --> 09:37.077
Oh, I remember him.
I saw a thing on 60 Minutes on him.

09:37.160 --> 09:39.121
Spent his life tracking down
that Halloween guy...

09:39.204 --> 09:41.123
who butchered all those kids
up in Haddonfield, right ?

09:41.206 --> 09:43.750
- Michael Myers.
- Right.

09:43.834 --> 09:48.005
- Hey, you don't think Michael Myers--
- They never found his body.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.007
Yeah, but that was,
like, 20 years ago.

09:56.555 --> 09:59.641
Fuck me.

09:59.725 --> 10:01.643
Loomis was obsessed
with Michael Myers.

10:01.727 --> 10:04.813
This is quite
a love fest.

10:04.897 --> 10:07.941
- I'll call up to Haddonfield
and warn 'em.
- There's no way, Fitz.

10:08.025 --> 10:09.985
Just a precaution.
Tomorrow's Halloween.

10:10.068 --> 10:12.696
All right, you tell 'em to look for
a guy with a cane and Alzheimer's.

10:12.779 --> 10:15.115
The guy would be
younger than I am, okay ?

10:15.240 --> 10:18.368
I was 15 when he killed
his sister back in '63.

10:18.452 --> 10:21.455
Yes, Fitzsimmons. Patch me through
to Haddonfield, please.

10:21.538 --> 10:25.083
- Yeah.
- Michael Myers.

10:25.167 --> 10:27.419
Yeah, right.

11:05.999 --> 11:08.502
I met him 15 years ago.

11:08.544 --> 11:10.504
I was told
there was nothing left.

11:10.587 --> 11:13.131
No reason, no conscience.

11:13.173 --> 11:16.802
No understanding. Even the most
rudimentary sense of life...

11:16.885 --> 11:20.305
and death, of good or evil...

11:20.347 --> 11:22.307
right or wrong.

11:22.349 --> 11:25.394
I met this
six-year-old child...

11:25.477 --> 11:30.357
with this blank, pale,
emotionless face, and...

11:31.942 --> 11:34.069
the blackest eyes.

11:34.152 --> 11:36.405
The devil's eyes.

12:02.139 --> 12:04.558
I spent eight years trying to reach him...

12:04.600 --> 12:06.852
and then another seven
trying to keep him locked up...

12:06.935 --> 12:10.856
because I realized that what was living
behind that boy's eyes...

12:10.898 --> 12:14.526
was purely, and simply...

12:14.568 --> 12:16.528
evil.

14:18.066 --> 14:20.444
Mom ! Mom ! Mom. Mom.

14:20.527 --> 14:23.780
- Mom ! Mom ! Mom. Mom !

14:25.365 --> 14:27.492
You okay ? You all right ?

14:27.576 --> 14:32.206
Oh. Oh !

14:32.289 --> 14:36.460
- Everything's okay. It's okay.

14:36.502 --> 14:40.964
- Do you need somethin' ?
- Oh ! Uh, yeah.

14:41.048 --> 14:42.966
Yeah, please. Thanks.

14:43.050 --> 14:45.469
- Sure.
- It's okay.

14:54.102 --> 14:57.981
Nightmares.

14:58.023 --> 15:00.567
Nightmares.

15:02.569 --> 15:04.488
Nightmares.

15:39.273 --> 15:41.233
- Making toast.
- Mm--

15:41.275 --> 15:44.945
No.
None for me, thanks.

15:45.028 --> 15:48.699
- Caffeine is not a food group.
- We're out of Percodan.

15:50.909 --> 15:53.662
Got mail.
It's from your dad.

15:59.543 --> 16:02.629
- Birthday card.
- It's only two months late.
I'm impressed.

16:02.713 --> 16:05.090
Cash is good. I'm gonna need it
when I go to Yosemite.

16:06.216 --> 16:08.135
- You're not going.
- Yes, I am.

16:08.218 --> 16:11.180
No, you're not.

16:11.263 --> 16:14.308
Yes, I am, and with your full blessing.
Do you want to know why ?

16:14.391 --> 16:17.394
- Why ?
- Because today is the day.

16:17.436 --> 16:19.938
I can feel it.
Today is the day...

16:19.980 --> 16:22.649
that you're going to realize
that I'm 17 years old...

16:22.733 --> 16:26.236
and your overprotection and paranoia
is inhibiting my growth process.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.740
Want to go camping ?
I'll take you camping.

16:30.782 --> 16:33.076
I don't want
to go with you.

16:33.160 --> 16:36.121
Sorry.

16:36.163 --> 16:39.333
- Dad would let me go.
- Well, Dad...

16:39.416 --> 16:41.919
is an abusive, chain-smoking
methadone addict.

16:41.960 --> 16:43.921
Who would attract
someone like that ?

16:45.172 --> 16:47.883
- Ouch.
- And just think, he left you.

16:47.966 --> 16:50.928
Look, John.

16:51.011 --> 16:55.057
I know you get your smart mouth
from my side of the family,
so I'll give you a break.

16:55.140 --> 16:58.185
- But point check, you're going too far.
- No, I'm goin' to Yosemite.

16:58.268 --> 17:01.563
- No, you're not.
- Look, Mom, help me out here.

17:01.647 --> 17:04.358
I need a little more open air.
I've earned it.

17:06.318 --> 17:08.362
Look, I know today is the day,
but I think that--

17:08.444 --> 17:11.531
- Oh, really ? What day is that, John ?
- Halloween.

17:12.741 --> 17:15.035
Oh, I hadn't noticed.

17:16.328 --> 17:18.247
Look, Mom,
we're through with all that.

17:20.207 --> 17:22.084
We really are.

17:30.050 --> 17:33.679
You know what you're becoming ?
You're becoming an Oedipal
enabler, you know that ?

17:33.762 --> 17:36.557
- Thank you.
- I'm serious !

17:36.640 --> 17:38.809
Twenty years from now, you're still
going to be living with her.

17:38.892 --> 17:40.853
Probably running some weird motel
out in the middle of nowhere.

17:40.894 --> 17:42.896
- So this means no Yosemite ?
- Correct.

17:42.980 --> 17:44.982
- Now, how do I get out of it ?
- Why don't you want to go ?

17:45.023 --> 17:47.818
Oh, it's so lame.
No, no, no. It's worse.

17:47.860 --> 17:50.153
I-l went there
two summers ago with my family.

17:50.237 --> 17:53.991
Loathsome. No, it's worse.
It'll come to me.

17:54.032 --> 17:57.119
Wretched. You know ?
Okay, think-think...

17:57.202 --> 17:59.121
campfires, s'mores--

18:21.560 --> 18:24.062
Repugnant !
That's it, repugnant.

18:24.146 --> 18:26.106
I would rather have
my eyes pierced.

18:28.233 --> 18:30.360
I'm very sorry.
I wish I could help. I'm sorry.

18:30.402 --> 18:32.446
- But he promised that--
- No. I'm not going.

18:32.529 --> 18:35.282
You couldn't pay me to go.

18:37.576 --> 18:41.413
- Hey, what's wrong ?
- Oh-- Uh, my dad.

18:41.497 --> 18:44.416
He flaked on
my financial aid again.

18:44.500 --> 18:47.377
- The bursar's being such a dick.
Now I can't go to Yosemite.
- You're not going either ?

18:47.419 --> 18:49.379
- No.
- I'm not going.

18:49.421 --> 18:51.381
- How are you going to get out of it ?
- Please.

18:51.423 --> 18:54.551
- Hey. Hold on. We ditch Yosemite.

18:54.593 --> 18:57.095
It means we could have
a Halloween party, just the four of us.

18:57.137 --> 18:59.473
Whole place would be empty.
We'd have the run of it.

18:59.556 --> 19:02.935
- We could have a roaming orgy.
- I love the way this man thinks !

19:03.018 --> 19:06.146
Hope that's not
the only thing you love about me.

19:10.567 --> 19:12.736
- Hey, come on.
- All right, let's go.

19:39.346 --> 19:42.391
Okay. You see,
I told you we'd make it.

19:42.474 --> 19:44.893
When I was a little girl,
we used to pee in the woods.

19:57.698 --> 20:01.243
- Ohh ! Uh--
- Don't worry !

20:05.372 --> 20:08.167
Come on.

20:08.250 --> 20:10.419
Mom, that's the boys' room.

20:10.502 --> 20:12.588
Then the boys are just
gonna have to deal with it.

20:14.047 --> 20:16.008
Hello ?

20:19.595 --> 20:22.264
Okay. Coast is clear.

20:33.859 --> 20:36.236
Okay. Come on.

20:40.324 --> 20:45.537
I'll be just next door.
Mom's gotta go too.

20:45.621 --> 20:48.874
## "Mary Had A Little Lamb"

20:49.791 --> 20:51.752
- Oh !
- Mom ?

20:51.793 --> 20:53.754
I know.

20:57.216 --> 21:02.387
- Mom ?
- It's just the door, Casey.

21:06.266 --> 21:10.395
Here's some tissues--
Casey ?

22:05.367 --> 22:07.786
Spiders !

22:16.587 --> 22:20.632
All right.
Ready ? You know why you're here.

22:20.716 --> 22:24.178
The buses leave for Yosemite
at 4:15, sharp.

22:32.603 --> 22:35.898
And now it's time for me
to do my obligatory plea...

22:35.981 --> 22:38.775
that you uphold
the standards of Hillcrest.

22:38.859 --> 22:42.321
And that means
no musical sleeping bags.

22:42.404 --> 22:44.364
- No booze.

22:44.406 --> 22:47.451
- No drugs, no kidding.

22:47.534 --> 22:50.370
Undoubtedly, someone will ruin it
for the rest of them...

22:50.412 --> 22:53.540
so I just want to remind you that
the entire teaching faculty has--

22:53.624 --> 22:56.084
- Hey ! Guess what this is.
- What ?

22:56.168 --> 23:00.297
It's my history report.
Forgot to hand it in.

23:00.380 --> 23:02.674
Guess who's not going to Yosemite.
I'm so bummed.

23:02.758 --> 23:04.718
Guess who has a fever of 102...

23:04.760 --> 23:06.720
and has to stay in bed
all weekend long.

23:06.762 --> 23:10.349
- You two company ?
- So, what's the plan ?

23:10.432 --> 23:13.143
Romantic dinner,
candlelight, soft music.

23:13.227 --> 23:16.438
- Animal sex.
- You need a hormone suppressant.

23:16.522 --> 23:19.274
You're embarrassing
the newlyweds, Charles.

23:19.358 --> 23:21.944
That's it.
Have a good time.

23:26.448 --> 23:28.826
And why aren't
you going camping, Miss Tate ?

23:28.909 --> 23:31.703
Because it sounds like fun.
And you, Mr. Brennan ?

23:31.745 --> 23:34.581
Guidance counselors aren't usually
a big hit in the wilderness.

23:34.665 --> 23:37.709
Besides, somebody has to stay behind and
watch over the three or four outcasts.

23:37.793 --> 23:39.753
Oh, good morning, Miss Tate.

23:39.795 --> 23:41.839
- Morning, Norma.
- Your mail and messages are
on your desk,

23:41.922 --> 23:44.258
along with the
new quarter budget, and oh,

23:44.299 --> 23:47.886
surprise, surprise, the drains in the
girls' shower room are clogged again.

23:47.970 --> 23:50.430
- Can I talk to you alone
for one second ?
- But, l-l called the plumber,

23:50.514 --> 23:52.432
and he assured me that
he will be here as soon as he can--

23:52.516 --> 23:55.269
Thank you, Norma.
Thank you very much.

23:57.646 --> 23:59.898
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
Place of employment.

23:59.940 --> 24:03.193
I'm sorry, l-l just--
I needed a fix.

24:05.571 --> 24:08.866
- We still on for lunch ?
- Uh-huh. 1:00.

24:08.949 --> 24:13.287
You are, without a doubt,
the most amazing,

24:13.370 --> 24:16.081
challenging woman
I have ever met.

24:16.165 --> 24:18.125
And what's wrong now ?

24:18.167 --> 24:21.837
Can you just stop with the
Keri analysis just once, please ?

24:21.920 --> 24:24.089
You can do it tomorrow,
all you want.

24:24.131 --> 24:26.884
But please, can I just
have today off ?

24:26.967 --> 24:30.262
- Whatever you want.
- Thank you.

24:30.304 --> 24:33.098
- Lunch. Don't forget.
- 1:00.

24:33.140 --> 24:35.100
Uh--

24:58.499 --> 25:02.127
"He turned, just in time
to see her enter the room,

25:02.169 --> 25:07.132
with her long, slender legs
that climbed high up her skirt,

25:07.216 --> 25:09.927
Ieading to two tumultuous,

25:10.010 --> 25:13.138
round, melon breasts."

25:13.180 --> 25:15.140
Round melon what ?

25:15.182 --> 25:17.142
Now why do you want
to label it like food ?

25:17.184 --> 25:20.687
A-And what kind of melon
you talkin' about ?
Cantaloupe ? Watermelon ? What ?

25:20.771 --> 25:23.941
Baby, it's fiction ! People like
to read descriptive adjectives.

25:24.024 --> 25:26.360
- It sets the scene.
- It's stupid is what it is.

25:26.401 --> 25:28.362
It's sensual
and romantic.

25:28.403 --> 25:30.197
Ronny, it's unrealistic. This whole
writing career is unrealistic.

25:30.197 --> 25:33.242
Ronny, it's unrealistic. This whole
writing career is unrealistic.

25:33.325 --> 25:36.036
Hey, we're married now,
baby, we gotta get serious.

25:36.078 --> 25:39.289
- This is serious.
- Honey, I been patient,
but this writing thing...

25:39.373 --> 25:42.668
just ain't takin' off, and I want
a baby before I get so old...

25:42.751 --> 25:44.920
- I can't get my butt back.
- You gotta give me a chance, honey.

25:45.003 --> 25:48.882
I have to express myself creatively.
We payin' the bills, aren't we ?

25:48.924 --> 25:51.301
- Uh ! Fuck me ! Shit !
- What ?

25:51.385 --> 25:53.846
Not you, honey. Hold on for a sec.
You scared the shit out of me !

25:53.929 --> 25:56.390
Sorry, Ronny.
I gotta ask a favor, man.

25:56.473 --> 25:58.350
- I'm not lettin' you out of here.
- Aw, come on, man.

25:58.433 --> 26:00.352
- Jus-Just for lunch. Please.
- Look, your mom told me...

26:00.435 --> 26:02.688
the next time I let you loose,
I was gonna be fired.

26:02.771 --> 26:06.149
- Look, man.
I got a date with Molly tonight.
- Mm-hmm.

26:06.233 --> 26:09.111
And I want to make it special.
What do you say ?

26:11.071 --> 26:13.949
Look, I promise I'll be back
for afternoon classes.

26:14.032 --> 26:16.451
Huh ? I just want
to get a gift.

26:16.493 --> 26:18.537
Come on, man, have a heart.

26:21.331 --> 26:25.085
No. No. Can't do it.

26:25.127 --> 26:28.463
Aw, come on, man.
Okay, how about this ?

26:28.505 --> 26:31.967
- You accidentally press the gate.
- Mm-hmm.

26:32.009 --> 26:34.219
And when you have
your back turned, we sneak out.

26:34.303 --> 26:36.513
Ronny, don't you get your ass fired--

26:42.811 --> 26:45.564
- Don't you do me wrong, okay ?
- Not a chance, man ! Cool.

26:45.647 --> 26:48.066
- All right.
- Get outta here, get outta here.
Comb your hair.

26:48.150 --> 26:50.986
- Just one more book.

26:51.028 --> 26:54.072
Just one more, and I promise
I'll work with your daddy, all right ?

27:50.295 --> 27:52.214
- Oh. Oh.
- Oh, Jesus, Will.

27:52.297 --> 27:55.717
- I'm sorry. I thought you saw me.
- No.

27:55.801 --> 27:58.637
You see me now ?

27:58.720 --> 28:01.473
How are you doin' ?

28:12.401 --> 28:14.444
You wanna talk about it ?

28:17.781 --> 28:19.741
I think I'm losing John.

28:22.411 --> 28:24.746
I think he's finally
tired of my bullshit.

28:26.498 --> 28:29.418
How about you ?

28:29.501 --> 28:31.420
You tired of my bullshit ?

28:31.503 --> 28:34.047
I'm a counselor.
I'm attracted to it.

28:36.383 --> 28:40.888
- So counsel me.
- Oh, no. I know better.

28:40.971 --> 28:43.182
I love you just
the way you are.

28:46.852 --> 28:49.104
Do you think
it's possible...

28:49.188 --> 28:51.106
that something so tragic
can happen to somebody...

28:51.190 --> 28:53.108
that they never
recover from it ?

28:53.192 --> 28:57.362
I like to believe that
recovery is always possible.

29:03.076 --> 29:06.580
There's a little back story
that I haven't been, um...

29:09.791 --> 29:13.003
- completely successful with.
- I know.

29:13.086 --> 29:17.257
I've tried everything. I really have.
I've tried everything.

29:17.341 --> 29:22.721
Twelve steps, uh,
self-help, group therapy,

29:23.805 --> 29:27.643
shrinks, meditation--

29:30.979 --> 29:33.482
- Everything.
- That's not everything.

29:33.565 --> 29:37.528
Oh, yeah ?
What else is there ?

29:37.611 --> 29:40.072
I'm a really
good listener.

29:48.163 --> 29:52.000
Maybe.
Some night, by a...

29:52.042 --> 29:54.002
warm fire.

30:00.092 --> 30:02.135
I'll be right back.

30:08.684 --> 30:11.270
Can I get another glass
of Chardonnay, please ?

30:13.397 --> 30:16.275
- Today.
- Yes, ma'am.

30:16.358 --> 30:18.277
Thank you.

30:28.954 --> 30:31.165
Thanks.

30:34.418 --> 30:36.378
Thank you very much.

30:50.642 --> 30:52.769
God. I can't believe
we're doin' this.

30:52.853 --> 30:54.855
- Desperate measures.
- It's illegal.

30:54.897 --> 30:56.899
It's harmless,
and expected.

30:56.940 --> 30:58.942
Studies have proven that
all teenagers, at some point...

30:59.026 --> 31:01.737
- in their adolescent lives,
have shoplifted.
- What studies ?

31:01.820 --> 31:03.697
Hey. We could have avoided
this whole thing...

31:03.739 --> 31:05.699
if you woulda simply scored
some of your mom's booze.

31:05.741 --> 31:08.202
- Look, my mom's a functioning
- alcoholic. She accounts for--
- John !

31:09.912 --> 31:13.040
- John, what are you doing here ?
- Just gettin' some off-campus lunch.

31:13.123 --> 31:16.710
You're not allowed to have
little off-campus lunches, John.

31:16.752 --> 31:20.672
- You know that. You too, Charlie.
- Sorry, Miss Tate.

31:20.756 --> 31:25.093
Come on,
I'll drive you back.

31:25.135 --> 31:27.387
You know what ?
Charlie, here.

31:27.471 --> 31:29.932
Go get in the car.
I'll be right there.

31:29.973 --> 31:31.725
What the fuck
do you think you're doing ?

31:31.808 --> 31:33.769
Mom, I'm really uncomfortable
with you saying that word.

31:33.810 --> 31:36.980
Well, then don't put me
in the position, John.

31:37.064 --> 31:39.608
Do you know
what day it is ?

31:39.691 --> 31:41.777
Of all the days
for you to pull this shit--

31:41.860 --> 31:47.491
What do you think you can do ?
Just wander around town ?

31:47.574 --> 31:49.493
I don't ask you
for very much.

31:49.576 --> 31:52.955
- Just give me one day !
- Mom, I've given you 17 years !

31:53.038 --> 31:55.332
And I need you
to be responsible.

31:55.415 --> 31:58.669
- Do you know what that means ?
- Responsible. Don't talk to me
about responsible, Mom !

31:58.752 --> 32:03.215
- I just need this one thing !
- Mom, I am not responsible for you !

32:04.758 --> 32:07.427
That's it. That's enough.
I can't take it, Mom.

32:07.511 --> 32:09.429
He's dead.

32:09.513 --> 32:12.558
Michael Myers is dead.

32:14.935 --> 32:17.354
- What do you want me to say ?
- That it's over ?

32:17.396 --> 32:22.234
That we should try to get on with
some attempt at a happy existence, Mom.

32:22.317 --> 32:25.195
Because all the shit that's going on
in your head is leakin' out on me.

32:25.237 --> 32:27.322
And I can't take it anymore.

32:29.491 --> 32:32.661
You told me yourself
you watched him burn.

32:34.496 --> 32:37.666
- I didn't e-exactly stay
to see his ashes, John.
- Mom, 20 years.

32:37.749 --> 32:40.794
Twenty years.

32:40.878 --> 32:43.714
Don't you think he would
have shown up by now ?

32:43.797 --> 32:46.258
What's he waitin' for, huh ?

32:49.052 --> 32:51.180
Okay, Mom. I can't live
like this. I'm sorry.

32:51.221 --> 32:54.600
Wha--
What does that mean, John ?

32:54.683 --> 32:56.977
If you want to stay handcuffed
to your dead brother, that's fine.

32:57.060 --> 33:00.522
But you're not draggin' me along.
Not anymore.

33:07.738 --> 33:10.657
- # Mister Sandman #
- Yes ?

33:10.741 --> 33:15.537
# Bring us a dream
Give him a pair of eyes with a-- ##

33:31.053 --> 33:32.971
Ronny ?

33:33.055 --> 33:37.059
- Mom, let me.
- Where the hell is he ?

33:41.230 --> 33:43.899
- Ronny !

33:45.025 --> 33:47.069
Hey, Ronny !

34:02.084 --> 34:04.753
- Where the hell were you ?
- Norma told me to walk the perimeter.

34:06.547 --> 34:08.549
And where were you
when these two got out ?

34:09.591 --> 34:12.344
Eyes up, Ronny.

34:19.016 --> 34:20.978
Psycho.

34:34.158 --> 34:37.161
Okay, bye !

34:53.886 --> 34:56.221
- Dennis !

34:56.304 --> 35:00.642
- Don't send down any more, all right ?
I gotta go to class.

35:19.703 --> 35:21.622
Dennis ?

36:26.103 --> 36:29.231
- Oh ! Uh !
- Shh ! The best part.

36:31.316 --> 36:34.820
Oh !

36:34.903 --> 36:37.322
Do I get points or what ?

36:37.406 --> 36:39.366
Huh ?

36:39.449 --> 36:43.162
You score. Yeah. Yeah.

36:43.245 --> 36:45.581
Hmm. Well, it just
occurred to me today...

36:45.622 --> 36:49.251
that I've never
celebrated Halloween before.

36:49.293 --> 36:51.253
And why is that ?

36:51.295 --> 36:54.089
Oh, we've got a psychotic
serial killer in the family,

36:54.131 --> 36:56.633
Ioves to butcher people
on Halloween, and...

36:56.717 --> 36:59.803
I just thought it
in bad taste to...

36:59.887 --> 37:01.805
celebrate.

37:01.889 --> 37:04.057
So why now ?

37:04.141 --> 37:07.269
Mm, because there comes a point in your
life where you have to concentrate...

37:07.352 --> 37:09.313
on what's right about it.

37:11.315 --> 37:13.233
Really ?

37:16.487 --> 37:19.281
And you...

37:19.323 --> 37:21.658
are a sterling example...

37:21.700 --> 37:23.660
of what's right.

37:25.579 --> 37:28.499
And tonight you get
my full concentration.

37:30.542 --> 37:33.462
I'm honored.

37:42.304 --> 37:44.723
Very good point, A.J.
So, what could Victor have done...

37:44.806 --> 37:46.808
to save Elizabeth ?

37:53.106 --> 37:55.609
Anybody at all ?

37:57.653 --> 38:01.323
Come on, people.
Did anybody read the book ?

38:02.825 --> 38:06.745
Guys.
It's "Frahnk-en-steen."

38:06.787 --> 38:10.958
- You could have watched the movie !

38:12.501 --> 38:14.837
Molly. Please.

38:14.920 --> 38:16.964
Do you have any thoughts
on Victor and Elizabeth ?

38:17.047 --> 38:19.675
Well, uh--
Um...

38:19.758 --> 38:23.136
Well, I think that Victor should have
confronted the monster sooner.

38:23.220 --> 38:25.180
I mea-- He's completely responsible
for Elizabeth's death.

38:25.264 --> 38:28.976
He was, he was so paralyzed by fear
that he never did anything.

38:29.059 --> 38:31.812
It-lt took death
for the guy to get a clue.

38:31.895 --> 38:36.441
And why do you think he was
finally able to confront his monster ?

38:36.483 --> 38:39.945
I think that Victor had reached
a point in his life where he
had nothing left to lose.

38:39.987 --> 38:42.781
I mean, the monster saw to that
by killing off everybody that he loved.

38:42.823 --> 38:44.825
Victor finally
had to face it.

38:44.908 --> 38:47.619
It was about redemption.
It was his fate.

38:52.708 --> 38:54.793
Okay, everybody, um,
have a good time !

39:06.638 --> 39:08.974
John !

39:17.566 --> 39:19.568
What ?

39:26.283 --> 39:29.328
It's a permission slip.

39:29.369 --> 39:31.830
Bus leaves in 45 minutes.

39:31.872 --> 39:35.375
- Go pack quick.
- Ma, I don't have to go.

39:35.459 --> 39:37.377
Go, just go ! Have fun.

39:37.461 --> 39:40.297
- You sure ?
- Yes. Look, it's good for you.

39:40.380 --> 39:42.549
It's good for me.

39:42.633 --> 39:45.928
So, just call me.
You know, call. And call.

39:46.011 --> 39:48.472
If you feel like
you've called too many times,

39:48.555 --> 39:50.891
call once more.

39:50.974 --> 39:53.977
Have a great time.

39:54.061 --> 39:56.188
Thanks, Mom.

40:02.069 --> 40:05.322
- Hi. So what was that all about ?
- Hey.

40:05.405 --> 40:07.324
She changed her mind
about Yosemite.

40:07.407 --> 40:09.409
- So now you're goin' ?

40:09.493 --> 40:11.411
Ah, I wouldn't say that.

40:30.347 --> 40:33.100
I don't know.
If we were at the midterm--

40:34.226 --> 40:36.144
No, she's doing fine.

40:36.228 --> 40:39.356
No--

40:43.277 --> 40:46.738
Mrs. Cheney,
can I call you right back ?

41:06.967 --> 41:10.304
- Uh, oh ! Oh !
- Damn it !

41:10.387 --> 41:14.600
Oh, Miss Tate, I'm-l'm so sorry.
I-l didn't mean to make you jump.

41:14.641 --> 41:18.103
- It's okay.
- Well, it's Halloween.
I guess everyone...

41:18.187 --> 41:20.564
- is entitled to one good scare.

41:20.647 --> 41:25.319
- I've had my share.
- U-Uh, Miss Tate,

41:25.402 --> 41:27.988
I know it's not my place.

41:28.071 --> 41:31.992
If I could be maternal
for a moment,

41:32.075 --> 41:34.828
I don't like
to see you like this.

41:34.912 --> 41:38.290
I've seen you
like this before, and...

41:38.373 --> 41:41.877
we've all had bad
things happen to us.

41:41.960 --> 41:45.631
The trick is
to concentrate on today !

41:47.799 --> 41:49.718
What do I know ?

41:49.801 --> 41:53.931
You just take care
of yourself, okay ?

41:54.014 --> 41:56.308
Thank you very much.
I'll see you Monday.

42:02.606 --> 42:05.984
Oh ! Mi-Miss Tate,
uh, Happy Halloween.

43:05.794 --> 43:08.797
"She took off her clothes,
revealing her satiny-soft femininity.

43:08.881 --> 43:10.966
And Lawrence looked at her
with lust in his eyes...

43:11.049 --> 43:14.386
and said, 'l want to invade
every part of your being.

43:14.469 --> 43:17.556
I want to tantalize myself
with your sweet nectar.'"

43:17.639 --> 43:19.600
Old Tanya better not
fall for that shit.

43:19.641 --> 43:23.020
- I smell that a mile away.
- "And Tanya laughed at him.

43:23.103 --> 43:25.063
'You don't expect me to fall
for that shit,' she said."

43:25.147 --> 43:27.983
That's right,
make her smart. That's it.

43:28.066 --> 43:30.068
- Oh, shit, honey, someone's here.
Can I call you back ?

43:30.152 --> 43:32.321
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I'll hold on.
I wanna know what stupid line...

43:32.404 --> 43:35.115
-Tanya falls for.
-The same one you did. Hold on a second.

43:46.460 --> 43:49.838
- Hello !

43:49.922 --> 43:51.840
Hello !

44:54.820 --> 44:56.780
- Hey, honey.
- What's up ? Where did you go ?

44:56.822 --> 44:59.950
I don't know. Some car at the gate.
I'm gonna have to call you.

45:18.343 --> 45:20.596
- Hey.
- Wait, wait. What's goin' on, baby ?

45:20.679 --> 45:23.390
- I don't know.

45:23.473 --> 45:25.684
Honey-- Where'd you--
Ronny !

45:25.767 --> 45:28.979
You always fuckin' doin' this. You get
me goin', and then you gotta go. Ro--

45:31.064 --> 45:33.567
Hello ?

47:06.410 --> 47:08.287
- Aah !
- Oh !

47:08.328 --> 47:10.789
I keep scaring you today.

47:10.831 --> 47:13.667
Wh-What are you doing ?

47:13.750 --> 47:16.670
Uh, n--

47:18.589 --> 47:21.592
Nothing. I, um--

47:21.675 --> 47:23.635
What are you doing ?

47:23.677 --> 47:26.763
I'm making the rounds. I still
have to check on the kids, but...

47:26.847 --> 47:30.726
I was hoping I would have the honor of
spending the evening with you tonight.

47:33.228 --> 47:35.147
I'd like the company.

47:35.230 --> 47:38.525
- Give me 20.
- Okay.

47:38.609 --> 47:40.527
I'm okay.

47:56.710 --> 47:58.921
Hello ?

47:59.004 --> 48:03.342
Do you want to die tonight, Cici ?

48:03.383 --> 48:07.679
- Oh, uh, come on... in.

48:09.598 --> 48:11.767
Sarah, Molly.

48:11.850 --> 48:16.021
Just checking on the Hillcrest remains.
You girls okay ?

48:16.104 --> 48:19.399
- Good. Thanks, Mr. Brennan.
- And how are you, Mr. Brennan ?
Looking cute as ever.

48:19.483 --> 48:21.944
Thank you, Sarah.
What are you two up to tonight ?

48:22.027 --> 48:24.530
Well, we thought we'd hit the town,
pick up some guys.

48:24.613 --> 48:27.449
You know, drop some Roofies in their
drinks. Have a whole date-rape evening.

48:27.533 --> 48:29.827
- Oh. Sounds good.
- Care to join us ?

48:29.910 --> 48:32.704
I can't. I'm, uh, I'm having
my nipples pierced.

48:32.788 --> 48:34.998
- Oh.
- But you two have a good time.

48:35.082 --> 48:38.126
- Will do.
- If you need anything,
contact me or Miss Tate.

48:38.210 --> 48:40.295
- Okay ?
- Thanks, Mr. Brennan.

48:40.379 --> 48:42.005
Behave.

48:42.089 --> 48:45.551
- My stash. Come on.

48:48.554 --> 48:53.016
- Come on.
- All right. Send it through here.

48:55.227 --> 48:57.104
Come on, man. Let's go.

48:58.480 --> 49:00.440
Yeah.

49:00.524 --> 49:02.442
Come on.

49:03.527 --> 49:06.405
John.

49:06.488 --> 49:08.615
Come on !

49:08.699 --> 49:13.162
I got you.

49:57.623 --> 49:59.583
Fuck it.

50:09.760 --> 50:11.637
I thought we'd do this right.

50:11.678 --> 50:13.639
Come on in.

50:17.309 --> 50:20.312
Oh, I love food.
I really do.

50:20.395 --> 50:23.232
I hope you don't mind
if I get really big and dumpy.

50:23.315 --> 50:25.275
- It's my goal in life.
- Oh, no.

50:25.317 --> 50:28.737
I, uh, I always found obesity
to be very sexy.

50:28.821 --> 50:31.156
God, you are so Renaissance.

50:42.668 --> 50:45.420
Oh, the buffet has arrived !

50:45.504 --> 50:47.965
Ah, for your pleasure tonight,

50:48.006 --> 50:52.636
we have prepared Wednesday, Thursday and
Friday's Hillcrest dinner selections,

50:52.678 --> 50:55.264
ignoring Meat Loaf Monday
and Turkey Tuesday.

50:55.347 --> 50:58.684
- Thank you very much.
I hate that meat loaf.
- Where's the booze ?

50:58.725 --> 51:01.728
- We need a corkscrew for that.
- Oh, I'll go get it.

51:01.812 --> 51:05.482
- Just don't start anything without me.
- Don't worry.

51:30.382 --> 51:33.302
I'm not who you think I am.

51:34.887 --> 51:36.805
Okay.

51:36.889 --> 51:38.807
Who are you ?

51:41.602 --> 51:44.146
My name's not Keri Tate.

51:44.229 --> 51:47.316
Mmm.

51:47.399 --> 51:49.318
What is it ?

51:51.278 --> 51:53.655
Laurie Strode.

51:57.618 --> 51:59.661
- Strode ?
- Strode.

51:59.745 --> 52:02.080
Okay.

52:02.164 --> 52:04.917
I changed my name
when I went into hiding.

52:05.000 --> 52:08.921
Oh, I like that.
That's like-- Iike the--
Iike the witness protection program.

52:08.962 --> 52:12.257
What, did you like rat out
the mob or something ?

52:15.177 --> 52:18.597
My brother killed my sister...

52:18.680 --> 52:21.016
- when she was 17.
- Wow.

52:21.099 --> 52:24.061
Well, that's... "sucky."

52:26.146 --> 52:28.065
How'd he do that ?

52:28.106 --> 52:31.276
With a really big,
sharp kitchen knife.

52:31.360 --> 52:33.737
That's terrible.

52:33.821 --> 52:35.739
Take off your clothes.

52:35.823 --> 52:37.825
You said you'd listen.

52:37.908 --> 52:40.702
Okay.

52:45.290 --> 52:48.377
They locked him up
for a long time,

52:48.460 --> 52:51.880
but he got out and...

52:51.964 --> 52:54.550
he came after me,

52:54.633 --> 52:57.386
but I got away.

52:57.469 --> 53:01.014
But he killed
a lot of my friends.

53:02.724 --> 53:07.146
- It happened--
- On Halloween.

53:07.229 --> 53:10.315
- You've heard the story.
- Who hasn't ?

53:11.733 --> 53:14.570
Michael Myers.

53:14.653 --> 53:17.239
It's like 20 years ago, right ?

53:17.322 --> 53:19.992
1978.

53:20.075 --> 53:23.078
And the girl that-- What happened
to the sister ? She died, right ?

53:25.581 --> 53:28.333
No, she faked her death.

53:30.586 --> 53:32.713
And now she's the headmistress...

53:32.796 --> 53:36.383
of a very posh, secluded
private school in northern California.

53:36.466 --> 53:38.677
What ?

53:38.760 --> 53:41.180
Hoping and praying every year...

53:43.265 --> 53:45.642
that her brother won't find her.

53:45.726 --> 53:48.145
You're tellin' me the truth ?

53:51.064 --> 53:54.443
- Now do you want a drink ?
- Yeah.

53:54.526 --> 53:56.487
I'll be right back.

54:07.748 --> 54:10.501
Explains a lot, doesn't it ?

54:10.584 --> 54:14.213
So you-- you have been living
with this for 20 years ?

54:14.296 --> 54:17.508
Something like that.

54:17.591 --> 54:20.385
But honey, you-you don't--

54:20.469 --> 54:22.888
You don't think that
after all this time h-he'd--

54:22.971 --> 54:26.141
he'd still be comin'
after you, do you ?

54:27.809 --> 54:31.522
He sat in a sanitarium
for 15 years, waiting for me.

54:33.190 --> 54:35.108
And then...

54:37.236 --> 54:41.448
one rainy night, he decides
to go trick-or-treating.

54:47.746 --> 54:49.665
How old were you ?

54:56.171 --> 54:58.090
Seventeen.

55:00.926 --> 55:02.845
What ?

55:04.471 --> 55:08.058
Do you think they made it to Yosemite ?
Do you think they're there ?

55:08.141 --> 55:12.479
- I don't know.
- I just-- I just want
to call Johnny. Just--

55:15.732 --> 55:18.277
What is it ?
Keri, what are you doing ?

55:18.360 --> 55:20.279
My phone's dead.

55:24.158 --> 55:26.118
Shit.

55:36.837 --> 55:40.007
- What's goin' on ?
- Somebody didn't go to Yosemite.

55:40.090 --> 55:42.259
Keri. Uh, what are you doing ?

55:42.301 --> 55:45.512
- I'm just gonna go find John.
- Th-- This is nuts.

55:45.596 --> 55:48.015
I hope so.

55:48.891 --> 55:51.810
- Jesus !
- Christ !

55:51.894 --> 55:53.979
Ronny, the phones are out.

55:54.062 --> 55:57.107
I know, and there's a strange car
parked down at the gate,

55:57.149 --> 55:59.860
but I can't seem to find
any signs of trespassing.

55:59.943 --> 56:02.821
- Fuck.
- Okay, th-there's no reason
to get upset yet.

56:02.863 --> 56:05.157
Let's just calm down.

56:05.199 --> 56:07.618
Look, I'm gonna go look
for John and the kids.

56:07.659 --> 56:11.455
See if you can get the phones
working, and we'll meet back
at the gate, okay ? Come on.

56:13.874 --> 56:15.918
Charlie !

56:16.001 --> 56:18.295
Charlie ?

56:18.337 --> 56:21.340
Where are you, Charlie ?
We're waiting on you.

56:23.217 --> 56:26.011
Charlie.

56:26.053 --> 56:28.514
Inconsiderate,
party of one,

56:28.555 --> 56:30.849
your table's ready.

56:35.062 --> 56:36.980
Charlie ?

56:43.529 --> 56:45.656
Hi ! Gotcha.

56:45.697 --> 56:47.658
You shit.

56:47.699 --> 56:50.369
I found these,
but no corkscrew.

56:50.410 --> 56:53.789
Come on. I'm hungry !
Where are you going now ?

56:53.872 --> 56:56.333
To see if there's
a corkscrew upstairs.

56:56.375 --> 56:58.627
- I'll be right back.

56:58.710 --> 57:01.880
- Charlie.

57:32.452 --> 57:34.413
Shit.

58:18.248 --> 58:20.667
Hi.

58:46.276 --> 58:48.862
- Shit.

58:49.947 --> 58:52.324
Lights up, Charlie.

58:52.366 --> 58:55.327
No sex games
till I've eaten.

58:59.832 --> 59:01.750
Fuck.

59:12.469 --> 59:15.222
Charlie.

59:15.264 --> 59:18.183
Charlie, what are you--

59:19.476 --> 59:21.436
Oh, shit !
Oh, my God !

59:23.856 --> 59:25.566
No !

59:27.401 --> 59:29.736
Oh, my--

59:34.825 --> 59:37.035
Aaah !

59:46.920 --> 59:48.881
Oh !

59:55.387 --> 59:57.973
- Oh !

01:00:18.785 --> 01:00:22.414
# They're laid to rest before ##

01:00:22.498 --> 01:00:25.417
- Did you hear that ?
- No. What was that ?

01:00:25.459 --> 01:00:27.419
## [ Off ]

01:00:28.921 --> 01:00:31.089
I'm gonna go check
on those guys.

01:00:31.131 --> 01:00:33.342
They've been gone
for a while.

01:00:33.425 --> 01:00:35.511
- What do you think they're doin' ?
- Hmm.

01:00:35.594 --> 01:00:38.013
- Mm-hmm.
- Kind of rates a cheap scare,
doesn't it ?

01:00:38.096 --> 01:00:40.015
- Let's go.
- All right.

01:00:52.027 --> 01:00:55.531
Oh, fuck !

01:00:55.614 --> 01:00:57.616
Please.

01:01:06.458 --> 01:01:09.211
Oh, please !

01:01:32.401 --> 01:01:35.904
- Hello !
- Maybe they just skipped to dessert.

01:01:38.407 --> 01:01:40.534
- What the hell's that ?
- Oh, man.

01:01:43.370 --> 01:01:45.330
What the fuck ?

01:01:56.133 --> 01:01:58.677
This is a sick joke.

01:02:23.076 --> 01:02:26.747
- Oh, shit !

01:02:26.830 --> 01:02:30.459
Who's that ?

01:02:30.542 --> 01:02:33.086
- Let's get out of here.

01:02:33.170 --> 01:02:36.006
Keep moving. Keep moving !

01:02:37.424 --> 01:02:40.135
Go. Go.

01:02:40.219 --> 01:02:42.346
- Go.
- Come on !

01:02:50.312 --> 01:02:52.898
- Come on !
- John, please !

01:02:52.981 --> 01:02:55.567
Oh, God. Oh, God.
What the fuck are we gonna do ?

01:02:55.651 --> 01:02:58.946
We go to the dorms, and we're gonna
call the cops. Okay ?

01:02:58.987 --> 01:03:01.657
- Come on.

01:03:01.740 --> 01:03:04.117
Oh, my God !
Oh, no, please !

01:03:10.749 --> 01:03:12.793
Aaah !

01:03:15.754 --> 01:03:17.631
Come on !

01:03:17.714 --> 01:03:20.259
Come on. Come on.

01:03:30.269 --> 01:03:33.021
Get up.

01:03:42.030 --> 01:03:43.949
Oh ! My keys.

01:03:44.032 --> 01:03:46.660
- Fuck ! Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, my God.
- Come on. Come on.

01:03:46.743 --> 01:03:49.913
I can't find it ! Oh, God.

01:03:49.997 --> 01:03:52.332
- Find the fucking keys !
- I know !

01:03:54.501 --> 01:03:57.462
Fuck !

01:03:57.546 --> 01:04:00.674
Oh... shit !

01:04:01.925 --> 01:04:03.969
- Molly !

01:04:04.052 --> 01:04:05.888
- Molly !

01:04:05.929 --> 01:04:08.223
- No !
- Molly !

01:04:18.942 --> 01:04:21.612
Somebody open
the fucking door !

01:04:25.616 --> 01:04:28.118
Oh, my God !

01:04:28.202 --> 01:04:31.914
- Somebody open the door !

01:04:57.272 --> 01:04:59.316
- What happened ?

01:04:59.399 --> 01:05:01.652
- Oh, God, he's stabbed.
- Can you walk ?
- Yeah.

01:05:01.735 --> 01:05:04.363
- Oh, God.

01:05:08.784 --> 01:05:10.953
- Wait.
- Who was that ?

01:05:12.996 --> 01:05:14.957
My brother.

01:05:20.838 --> 01:05:23.924
Get in there.
Barricade the door. Lock it.

01:05:24.007 --> 01:05:26.426
- Do as I say, now !
- Go.

01:05:26.510 --> 01:05:28.971
Go !

01:05:29.012 --> 01:05:31.265
All right, what do we do ?
What do we do ?

01:05:31.348 --> 01:05:33.267
Try to live.

01:05:44.361 --> 01:05:46.196
Go.
- What ?

01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:48.198
- Jump. Go !
- Keri.

01:05:48.282 --> 01:05:51.076
- I'm not leaving you.
- I'm not leaving John.

01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:55.747
Keri !

01:06:10.387 --> 01:06:12.890
Oh.

01:06:16.810 --> 01:06:19.897
Oh, no !

01:06:19.980 --> 01:06:21.482
Oh ! Oh, God !

01:06:23.233 --> 01:06:25.569
Oh, God. Oh, no.

01:06:25.652 --> 01:06:29.156
- Oh.

01:06:31.241 --> 01:06:34.244
Oh, God. Oh.
I thought--

01:06:34.328 --> 01:06:37.664
- Will !

01:06:55.766 --> 01:06:58.143
Oh, fuck !
