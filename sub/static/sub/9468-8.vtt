00:32.517 --> 00:34.644
Fucking gypsy.

00:34.686 --> 00:37.397
Fuck him. Fuck him.

00:37.439 --> 00:39.608
Fuck you! Fuck you,

00:39.649 --> 00:42.151
you little fucking faggot!

00:52.537 --> 00:54.997
Fuck!

01:04.340 --> 01:06.342
Fuck!

02:28.341 --> 02:30.259
Can I help you? Hey!

02:30.301 --> 02:32.303
You know who I am.

02:36.683 --> 02:40.061
Why don't you sit
the fuck down?

03:35.951 --> 03:38.244
I would sooner you didn't.

03:38.286 --> 03:41.497
- Stay the fuck away from me!
- Please give it to me.

03:41.539 --> 03:44.042
I don't think either of us would
enjoying explaining to Olivia

03:44.084 --> 03:48.170
- how you lost a hand.
- What's back there? Is it Ouroboros?

03:48.212 --> 03:50.172
Frankly, you don't even have
to give it to me.

03:50.214 --> 03:52.341
I would just be substantially
more comfortable

03:52.383 --> 03:55.637
- if you extinguished it.
- Ouroboros.

03:55.678 --> 03:57.346
I'm sorry?

04:00.016 --> 04:01.977
The fucking snake.

04:02.018 --> 04:04.145
What is it? Why is it
in my dreams?

04:04.186 --> 04:06.397
What a fascinating thing
to ask.

04:06.439 --> 04:11.111
- I can make you tell me.
- I would sooner you didn't.

04:11.152 --> 04:14.447
Unless you plan on rearranging
your positron emissions,

04:14.489 --> 04:16.574
you'll have to let me through.

04:23.873 --> 04:26.501
I apologize for the walk.
Where we are going,

04:26.542 --> 04:28.586
there are certain
electromagnetic irregularities

04:28.628 --> 04:30.338
that make elevators...

04:30.379 --> 04:34.383
problematic. When Jacob Godfrey

04:34.425 --> 04:37.345
first saw Henry Bessemer's
revolutionary new process

04:37.386 --> 04:39.597
for making steel,
he said the words,

04:39.639 --> 04:41.891
"Mr. Bessemer, I'd like
to buy the future".

04:41.933 --> 04:45.103
Your father said the same words
to me our first meeting,

04:45.145 --> 04:48.356
when I was a pariah
of my own community.

04:48.397 --> 04:52.276
It's quite a mantle being
passed on to you, young man.

04:52.318 --> 04:54.737
You think I don't know that?

05:00.160 --> 05:02.120
What is this?

05:02.162 --> 05:05.247
Exactly what it looks like.

05:07.959 --> 05:10.962
This is Project
Ouroboros, Roman.

05:13.965 --> 05:16.843
Oh, my god. You--

05:29.772 --> 05:32.150
- You can see why we're
rather sensitive about it.

05:47.415 --> 05:49.375
<i>An appetite.</i>

05:49.417 --> 05:52.545
Someone has replaced this rake
with a child of mine.

05:52.587 --> 05:56.424
And it smiles.

05:56.465 --> 05:59.343
You know that feeling when you have a
toothache and you don't know how bad it is

05:59.385 --> 06:02.513
- until it's gone?
- Yep.

06:02.555 --> 06:04.515
Well, I wasn't gonna
say anything,

06:04.557 --> 06:07.727
but I think you're better off
without this tooth.

06:07.769 --> 06:09.979
- Can I have some juice?
- Yeah.

06:10.021 --> 06:14.067
Huh. It's not my shade.

06:14.109 --> 06:16.527
Well, we're making
all kinds of friends.

06:16.569 --> 06:19.697
I'm a friendly guy.

06:19.739 --> 06:23.076
Does this friend have a name?

06:23.118 --> 06:24.786
Yeah.

06:24.827 --> 06:26.955
Does her friend need
to have his ear twisted?

06:26.996 --> 06:30.541
Hey, babe.

06:30.583 --> 06:33.169
- It's Letha.
- Lisa?

06:33.211 --> 06:36.798
Letha. It's like
Lisa but with a lisp.

06:36.839 --> 06:38.925
Well, um, I think
it's meant to be

06:38.967 --> 06:41.677
'cause neither one of you
know how to wash a glass.

06:44.264 --> 06:48.392
It's Letha Godfrey.

06:48.434 --> 06:51.395
Are you doing this on purpose?

06:51.437 --> 06:53.689
I'm not doing anything.

06:55.691 --> 06:58.236
It has nothing to do with him.

06:58.278 --> 07:00.196
Does he know that?

07:00.238 --> 07:03.699
I could care less.

07:03.741 --> 07:07.203
Well, give it a shot for me.

07:38.318 --> 07:40.028
Hey!

07:40.069 --> 07:43.489
Hey! Let me out of here!

07:43.531 --> 07:47.660
Let me out of here! Let me out of here!
Let me out of here, you fucking maniac!

07:47.702 --> 07:49.620
That is Project Ouroboros.

08:02.217 --> 08:06.221
My beautiful boy.

08:06.262 --> 08:08.764
He was agitated

08:08.806 --> 08:10.766
and clearly had been
using narcotics.

08:10.808 --> 08:12.768
I was afraid he was
a danger to himself,

08:12.810 --> 08:15.396
but I only gave him a sedative.
His brain activity

08:15.437 --> 08:18.149
is normal and there's no
physiological explanation

08:18.191 --> 08:20.818
for his condition.
And we're on Norman's turf now,

08:20.860 --> 08:22.987
but I suspect he's had
a severe psychic break.

08:23.029 --> 08:26.282
He's preventing himself
from waking up.

08:36.042 --> 08:38.753
He's coming home, Johann.

08:40.755 --> 08:44.384
I would strongly advise
against that.

08:44.425 --> 08:48.012
His condition needs
to be monitored.

08:48.054 --> 08:50.098
He's coming home.

09:22.504 --> 09:25.507
Road policing
in your jurisdiction now?

09:25.549 --> 09:28.469
This is Roman Godfrey's
car, isn't it? I understand

09:28.510 --> 09:30.972
it was found abandoned
somewhere near the White Tower.

09:31.013 --> 09:34.516
What you understand gets
more complicated every day.

09:34.558 --> 09:36.518
What can I say?

09:36.560 --> 09:39.063
- I'm into the I's and t's.
- No, you're not.

09:39.105 --> 09:41.399
Professional courtesy
extends both ways.

09:41.441 --> 09:45.069
I'm sorry. Have I been
discourteous?

09:45.111 --> 09:49.282
Your trip to the Godfrey
house didn't go unnoticed,

09:49.324 --> 09:51.867
or that I had to hear about it
so long after the fact.

09:51.909 --> 09:54.454
So let me make this
plain to you.

09:54.495 --> 09:57.165
If the issue involves,
as your patch suggests,

09:57.206 --> 09:59.792
fish and wildlife,

09:59.834 --> 10:02.586
have at it. Otherwise,

10:02.628 --> 10:05.381
stay out of police business.

10:05.423 --> 10:07.800
Point taken.

10:07.842 --> 10:10.261
Back to my original
question--

10:10.303 --> 10:12.430
- Yeah, not far from the tower.

10:24.442 --> 10:27.862
<i>The first thing he'll feel
when he wakes up will be...</i>

10:27.903 --> 10:31.532
the warmth of the sun
on his face.

10:31.573 --> 10:34.910
It'll be a pleasant feeling.

10:34.952 --> 10:37.163
He'll wonder
that he ever felt ill.

10:37.205 --> 10:40.375
Perhaps there'll be
a song of a bird,

10:40.416 --> 10:42.751
a mourning dove.

10:42.793 --> 10:46.005
I saw a pair just yesterday.
They haven't all gone yet.

10:59.810 --> 11:02.688
Strength and sorrow,

11:02.730 --> 11:06.608
give no thus to those
you love the most.

11:23.418 --> 11:25.378
<i>Come back.</i>

11:29.257 --> 11:32.843
<i>You promised you wouldn't
leave me. I need you.</i>

11:37.681 --> 11:40.684
<i>Come back.</i>

11:40.726 --> 11:44.063
<i>- Come back.  - You could have at least
left me my fucking cigarettes!</i>

11:46.232 --> 11:48.984
I could really use a goddamn
cigarette right now!

11:49.026 --> 11:53.573
Sometimes I think that the only
thing that ever really made you happy

11:53.613 --> 11:56.033
was your dead father's car.

11:58.035 --> 12:00.371
Who are you?

12:00.413 --> 12:02.373
I'm the one who took
your cigarettes.

12:02.415 --> 12:06.626
You know I hate
how much you smoke.

12:06.668 --> 12:10.131
- Who are you?
- Oh, please.

12:10.172 --> 12:13.384
- Oh, please.
- Where am I?

12:13.426 --> 12:15.803
In my room, breaking my heart,
you jerk.

12:15.844 --> 12:17.846
Breaking my heart, you jerk.

12:17.888 --> 12:21.392
<i>- Come back. - Come back.
- Shelley?</i>

12:21.434 --> 12:24.145
<i>Come back.</i>

12:24.186 --> 12:26.397
Pryce fucking drugged me.

12:26.439 --> 12:28.483
Oh, your system's
been through worse.

12:28.524 --> 12:30.485
<i>He's not the reason you're here.</i>

12:30.526 --> 12:33.321
Then what is?

12:33.362 --> 12:36.532
Why not ask your razor
the next time you cut yourself?

12:38.784 --> 12:40.869
<i>A common motif
in Greek mythology</i>

12:40.911 --> 12:43.289
<i>is the catabasis,</i>

12:43.331 --> 12:46.459
<i>a ritualized descent
into the underworld</i>

12:46.501 --> 12:49.837
<i>to accomplish a necessary task</i>

12:49.878 --> 12:53.424
<i>or defeat a dangerous adversary.</i>

13:01.140 --> 13:03.643
What? I'm a fucking scorpion.

13:03.683 --> 13:07.438
Be careful what you say you are,
because that is what you are.

13:07.480 --> 13:11.192
- What do I do about it?
- You need to do what you came here to do.

13:11.233 --> 13:15.821
- What is that? - You need to turn those
pretty eyes inward toward the monster

13:15.863 --> 13:21.160
ripping you apart. Destroy the Dragon
before its fire burns you alive!

14:19.385 --> 14:21.011
Jesus Christ!

14:21.053 --> 14:23.097
A Springfield?

14:23.138 --> 14:25.140
What happened
to my Remington girl?

14:25.182 --> 14:28.310
She almost put two
in your anginal heart.

14:28.352 --> 14:31.021
You were always an ace
at this range,

14:31.063 --> 14:34.233
center mass grouping,
perfect sight picture.

14:36.235 --> 14:38.195
What the fuck
are you doing here?

14:38.237 --> 14:41.323
I was concerned

14:41.365 --> 14:44.368
after our last call.

14:48.539 --> 14:50.499
How is your sight picture

14:50.541 --> 14:52.960
these days, hmm?

14:58.173 --> 15:01.761
You know, Dad never really
talks about his brother.

15:03.763 --> 15:06.557
Well, it's not an easy thing
for him to discuss.

15:06.599 --> 15:09.143
Believe me, I've tried.

15:09.184 --> 15:12.271
It's what he might call
repression.

15:14.273 --> 15:16.900
Your father's very good
at his job,

15:16.942 --> 15:21.572
but he could stand to point that powerful
psychiatric microscope at himself once in a while.

15:23.907 --> 15:27.286
Do it!

15:27.328 --> 15:30.331
Okay. How did I use
to do this?

15:30.372 --> 15:33.875
I am deeply concerned.

15:33.917 --> 15:35.919
That's good.
You almost have it.

15:35.961 --> 15:38.464
You almost have it. You're
doing more of a frown thing.

15:38.506 --> 15:41.258
It's really just more
of a sort of constipated...

15:41.300 --> 15:44.386
completely straight
line. Hello.

15:44.428 --> 15:47.640
It is said that what women
fear most is violence from men,

15:47.682 --> 15:50.643
but what men fear most
is being laughed at by women.

15:50.685 --> 15:53.479
Hmm. I'm deeply
concerned by that.

15:53.521 --> 15:57.024
Ha, ha, ha! You know, it's uh,

15:57.065 --> 15:59.026
it's a good thing I leave
the office from time to time

15:59.067 --> 16:01.153
or I might mistake myself

16:01.195 --> 16:04.365
- for a respected man.
- Yes, honey, it is a very good thing

16:04.406 --> 16:07.702
that you leave
the office. Hi.

16:07.743 --> 16:10.329
- No. They don't work on you.
- Really?

16:10.371 --> 16:13.541
Well, you're missing
the gravitas acquired by years

16:13.582 --> 16:16.877
- of stoic suffering.
- Oh, you mean wrinkles.

16:27.346 --> 16:30.391
Hello?

16:30.432 --> 16:32.393
What?

16:32.434 --> 16:36.188
Hang on. I don't understand
what you're telling me.

16:36.230 --> 16:39.525
Okay, I'll come right over.

16:39.567 --> 16:41.569
What's wrong?

16:43.571 --> 16:45.573
Roman's in a coma.

16:48.617 --> 16:50.911
This is how you see yourself?

16:50.952 --> 16:53.038
This is how you
make me see myself.

16:53.080 --> 16:55.541
Thank you.

16:55.583 --> 16:58.711
- When did you learn those words?
- You were the only thing

16:58.753 --> 17:00.962
holding us together.
You always were.

17:01.004 --> 17:03.799
<i>I just wish I could
teach you how to see yourself.</i>

17:12.558 --> 17:15.685
What happened?

17:15.728 --> 17:17.688
A drug overdose.

17:17.730 --> 17:21.066
Can we talk downstairs?

17:25.613 --> 17:28.531
I haven't been in that
attic in 30 years.

17:28.574 --> 17:31.076
You know he should be
in a hospital.

17:31.118 --> 17:35.247
He's staying here.

17:35.289 --> 17:37.499
What drugs?

17:37.541 --> 17:39.710
A number, evidently.

17:39.752 --> 17:41.712
He was causing a scene
at the institute

17:41.754 --> 17:43.839
and Johann sedated him.

17:43.881 --> 17:47.551
Sedated him? That's
not sedation, Olivia.

17:47.593 --> 17:49.553
That's a coma.

17:49.595 --> 17:51.555
You left Pryce still breathing?

17:51.597 --> 17:53.557
The coma is Roman's,

17:53.599 --> 17:56.435
not Johann's. He did
what he had to do.

17:56.477 --> 17:58.729
- Why was he there?
- I don't know.

17:58.771 --> 18:00.731
I suppose Johann

18:00.773 --> 18:03.567
- doesn't either.
- Let it go, Norman.

18:03.609 --> 18:07.237
Do you know anything
about Project Ouroboros?

18:07.279 --> 18:11.533
I told you, I haven't got any better
idea what goes on there than you do.

18:11.575 --> 18:13.535
Then why was he there?

18:13.577 --> 18:16.538
Something's going on here.
You can't act like it's not.

18:22.127 --> 18:24.713
Liv.

18:26.715 --> 18:30.511
Liv, Liv, Liv.

18:42.982 --> 18:46.151
You know, you don't have
to do that anymore.

18:47.569 --> 18:49.822
Protect me from the truth.

18:49.864 --> 18:52.032
I know him.

18:54.034 --> 18:57.830
I'm sorry.

19:01.917 --> 19:04.169
Do you think
he's gonna wake up?

19:06.922 --> 19:09.466
Well,

19:09.508 --> 19:12.803
I think that's up to Roman now.

19:17.725 --> 19:20.268
The Godfrey boy's in a coma.

19:20.310 --> 19:23.188
I know. The heart aches.

19:24.899 --> 19:27.818
Nic.

19:27.860 --> 19:29.945
You old leg-humper.

19:29.987 --> 19:32.948
You know, there are better places
to have this conversation.

19:32.990 --> 19:35.617
We have time.

19:35.659 --> 19:37.619
We always have had time

19:37.661 --> 19:39.914
for each other.

19:42.207 --> 19:46.086
You also seem to have exhausted the
patience of the local law enforcement.

19:48.088 --> 19:50.716
Seems Roman Godfrey
had quite the night.

19:52.718 --> 19:55.136
It's the White Tower. There's
something happening there.

19:55.178 --> 19:57.514
Pryce is playing liar's poker.

19:57.556 --> 20:00.392
Francis Pullman saw his hand,

20:00.434 --> 20:04.563
drove a titanium syringe three
inches into his temporal lobe.

20:04.605 --> 20:08.233
- And Rumancek?
- They were at the mill.

20:08.275 --> 20:10.193
<i>They found the rest
of Willoughby.</i>

20:10.235 --> 20:12.112
<i>Or left her there.</i>

20:12.153 --> 20:14.698
<i>I'm not so sure.</i>

20:14.740 --> 20:18.368
No sooner did the Hardy Boys break up but
their mothers are seeing each other.

20:18.410 --> 20:21.204
Olivia Godfrey.

20:21.246 --> 20:23.916
She was at the mill too.

20:23.958 --> 20:26.043
Her name is on the place.

20:26.085 --> 20:29.463
<i>This was not
the first body to fall there.</i>

20:29.504 --> 20:31.465
<i>Prior to her taking
that name in 1993,</i>

20:31.506 --> 20:33.550
<i>there's no scrap
of history to be found.</i>

20:38.346 --> 20:40.682
But a woman like that...

20:42.810 --> 20:46.021
I suspect JR Godfrey's not the first
man to lose his head over her.

20:48.440 --> 20:50.859
I think she might be upir.

20:53.112 --> 20:56.657
- Why are we talking about Olivia Godfrey?
- Do I need to repeat myself?

20:56.698 --> 21:00.119
- I sent you here to hunt an animal.
- And I found a whole herd.

21:00.160 --> 21:04.123
Then what are we doing
in Peter Rumancek's trailer?

21:04.164 --> 21:07.208
I don't know.

21:07.250 --> 21:09.795
"I found myself in a dark wood,

21:09.837 --> 21:12.464
for the straight way was lost."

21:12.506 --> 21:14.466
If you're trying
to inform my direction,

21:14.508 --> 21:16.635
<i>I'd rather you didn't
quote the Inferno.</i>

21:16.677 --> 21:20.055
Dante had his Virgil
to guide him.

21:20.097 --> 21:22.432
Let me be yours.

21:22.474 --> 21:24.476
Forget Olivia Godfrey.

21:24.518 --> 21:26.269
Her footprint's
at the crime scene.

21:26.311 --> 21:28.480
- I confirmed it.
- She's a diversion.

21:28.522 --> 21:31.984
- She's a suspect. - You have great
instincts for the hunt, Clementine.

21:32.026 --> 21:34.569
Trust them.

21:36.822 --> 21:38.907
Clear your head

21:38.949 --> 21:41.952
and bring me Peter Rumancek.

22:33.795 --> 22:37.966
Thank you for coming back.

22:51.270 --> 22:53.356
I love you.

22:53.398 --> 22:56.944
I love you.

23:17.256 --> 23:19.716
Is this where the Dragon is?

23:19.758 --> 23:22.761
I don't know.
Ask yourself, Roman.

23:22.803 --> 23:25.722
You're the one with
the questions and the answers.

23:27.724 --> 23:30.185
Will you come with me?

23:30.227 --> 23:32.479
I can't.
You won't be alone.

23:32.520 --> 23:35.482
Everyone you blame for your mistakes is
waiting for you just on the other side.

23:35.523 --> 23:38.735
- I'm a warrior. Warrior!
- Prove it.

23:42.281 --> 23:44.532
All right.

24:01.382 --> 24:03.802
I'm here.
I can help you.

24:06.763 --> 24:09.766
Biologically speaking,
young girls have a blood rite

24:09.808 --> 24:13.145
that initiates them into adulthood,
whether they are ready for it or not.

24:13.187 --> 24:17.149
To compensate, all tribal cultures put
their young males through some ordeal

24:17.191 --> 24:20.777
at puberty, separating
the boy's world from the man's.

24:20.819 --> 24:23.530
It's not your fault
you're weak, Roman.

24:23.571 --> 24:27.117
- I'm not weak.
- You think Peter would cry over you?

24:41.256 --> 24:43.967
It's unusual for the knight
to take the king.

24:44.009 --> 24:45.969
The bishop

24:46.011 --> 24:48.680
has far greater talent
for the end game.

24:48.722 --> 24:51.933
Kneel.

24:59.524 --> 25:02.027
You think the Dragon

25:02.069 --> 25:04.821
gives a shit
about your nobility?

25:04.863 --> 25:08.116
He's gonna eat you alive.

25:08.158 --> 25:10.327
<i>He's gonna eat you alive.</i>

25:10.369 --> 25:14.248
He's gonna eat you alive!

25:30.555 --> 25:33.558
Have a seat.

25:40.815 --> 25:44.069
Roman, Roman, Roman.

25:44.111 --> 25:46.029
How can I help you?

25:46.071 --> 25:47.989
I'm looking for the Dragon.

25:48.031 --> 25:50.449
Well, let's see
what my Swiss colleague

25:50.491 --> 25:53.161
has to say about this.

25:53.203 --> 25:57.332
- Doctor. - The subject here
is in an unconscious condition,

25:57.374 --> 26:00.877
which he believes to be his catabasis, and
he won't be able to reach the surface

26:00.919 --> 26:05.548
if he doesn't "confront
the Dragon", Doctor.

26:05.590 --> 26:09.636
All consciousness
separates, but in dreams

26:09.677 --> 26:12.806
<i>we put on the likeness
of the more universal,</i>

26:12.847 --> 26:16.517
<i>truer, more eternal man</i>

26:16.559 --> 26:20.397
in the darkness
of primordial night.

26:20.439 --> 26:24.859
Oh, well, his sister's appearing to
him in the form of a guide, Doctor.

26:24.901 --> 26:27.070
To deliver a classic

26:27.112 --> 26:29.406
messiah archetype.

26:29.448 --> 26:32.617
<i>We know that our Shelley
lends herself to this, Doctor.</i>

26:32.659 --> 26:34.453
Then you believe
the purpose of this episode

26:34.493 --> 26:38.165
<i>- to be redemption, Doctor.
- It is recommended</i>

26:38.206 --> 26:40.834
that the subject
search for clues

26:40.875 --> 26:44.379
within the dream landscape.

26:44.421 --> 26:47.506
<i>In this instance,</i>

26:47.548 --> 26:49.801
the Dragon is clearly

26:49.843 --> 26:52.429
the subject's own shadow,

26:52.471 --> 26:55.807
the most repressed
of his inner thoughts.

26:55.849 --> 26:59.311
<i>As for the oft-mentioned</i>

26:59.353 --> 27:02.063
representation, Ouroboros,

27:02.105 --> 27:04.149
<i>the snake</i>

27:04.191 --> 27:06.776
<i>consuming its own tail,</i>

27:06.818 --> 27:08.987
I could go on and on,

27:09.029 --> 27:11.031
but ironically,

27:11.072 --> 27:13.783
<i>it will not be apparent</i>

27:13.825 --> 27:16.119
<i>to a young boy</i>

27:16.161 --> 27:19.580
with such a sense of self-fellatio.

27:19.622 --> 27:22.042
Ha, ha, ha!

27:22.083 --> 27:24.543
What are the stakes
of this narrative?

27:24.585 --> 27:27.088
I mean, if this is all in his head, what's
the worst thing that can happen to him?

27:27.130 --> 27:31.092
Step a little closer,
please, Doctor.

27:31.134 --> 27:33.136
Oh.

27:33.178 --> 27:35.138
Mm-hmm.

27:35.180 --> 27:37.224
Mm-hmm.

27:40.685 --> 27:42.979
<i>A word of advice, young man.</i>

27:43.021 --> 27:46.149
Too much of the animal

27:46.191 --> 27:49.944
dislocates the civilized
human being.

27:49.986 --> 27:52.322
Too much culture

27:52.364 --> 27:54.741
makes a sick animal.

27:57.411 --> 28:01.122
- Well, that's very helpful!
- Roman, what I'm curious about

28:01.164 --> 28:04.501
is, if you're dealing with
repressed unconscious contents,

28:04.543 --> 28:08.296
what exactly I'm doing here? It seems
like you'd have more to say to Olivia.

28:08.338 --> 28:12.133
Yeah. Where is your mother?

28:12.175 --> 28:15.095
- I'd really like to give her
a piece of my mind. - Ha!

28:16.637 --> 28:18.306
Sit down.

28:20.308 --> 28:23.728
I was only a few years older than you
when I took over the Godfrey steel.

28:23.770 --> 28:27.857
It was close to insolvency.

28:27.899 --> 28:30.902
I got us back in the black.
I was the hero of the town.

28:30.944 --> 28:33.113
Is he fucking
kidding me with this?

28:33.154 --> 28:36.324
What was I supposed to do?
Watch the town slowly commit suicide,

28:36.366 --> 28:39.327
- or give it a future?
- Fuck your legacy!

28:39.369 --> 28:42.830
You're a coward.
Why did you do it?

28:45.500 --> 28:48.836
When your older
sister, Juliet, was born,

28:48.878 --> 28:53.007
your mother had about as much
interest in holding her as a wet towel.

28:53.049 --> 28:55.885
When you were born,
on the other hand...

28:58.012 --> 29:01.099
Give him to me.

29:01.141 --> 29:04.269
Give him to me!
Give him to me!

29:04.311 --> 29:06.480
Give him to me!

29:06.521 --> 29:10.484
Give him to me!
Give him to me!

29:13.278 --> 29:16.490
<i>I knew I couldn't
protect you from her.</i>

29:16.531 --> 29:19.451
<i>She wouldn't let me.</i>

29:19.493 --> 29:22.954
You left me alone.
You left me alone with her.

29:22.996 --> 29:25.373
Roman, half of her is in you.

29:25.415 --> 29:27.959
- That's your only chance.
- The only chance of what?

29:28.001 --> 29:32.380
Don't you find it odd you've never met
anyone from her side of the family?

29:32.422 --> 29:36.301
You think they don't know about you?
You were better off on your own

29:36.343 --> 29:40.054
- than with a waste of a father.
- Fuck you for making that decision for me.

29:42.516 --> 29:44.476
Fine.

29:44.518 --> 29:46.727
I was better off.

29:46.769 --> 29:48.729
But you can talk to him

29:48.771 --> 29:51.065
about your feelings about it.

29:53.527 --> 29:56.112
<i>He's your real dad, anyway.
He's your real dad, anyway.</i>

30:05.830 --> 30:08.208
<i>Have you people ever considered</i>

30:08.249 --> 30:10.877
that Roman might quit pulling this shit
if you just stopped fucking letting him?

30:10.918 --> 30:13.087
This isn't you.

30:13.129 --> 30:15.882
I know you.

30:17.884 --> 30:19.886
Don't make this my problem.

30:23.848 --> 30:26.851
No petting in
the halls, Rumancek.

31:39.758 --> 31:42.469
You paid your money!

31:42.510 --> 31:45.179
You paid your money!
You paid your money!

31:45.221 --> 31:48.683
You paid your fucking money!

31:56.857 --> 31:58.652
You said you'd give me a ride.

32:00.445 --> 32:02.905
It was you.

32:02.947 --> 32:04.907
I don't want to see that.

32:04.949 --> 32:08.077
<i>I don't want to see that!</i>

32:23.802 --> 32:25.804
Is that blood?

32:34.813 --> 32:38.065
Stupid-ass birds!

32:43.321 --> 32:44.781
Are you okay?

32:48.117 --> 32:50.077
We're in this together.

32:50.119 --> 32:53.623
Holy fuck!

33:01.005 --> 33:05.760
- Say what you have to say to me.
- We're in this together, you and I.

33:07.762 --> 33:09.972
Why do you need that
to be true so badly?

33:10.014 --> 33:11.850
Why can't you admit it?

33:11.891 --> 33:15.562
I guess we're both scorpions.

33:15.603 --> 33:18.606
Is there anything
I can do to fix this?

33:23.403 --> 33:26.989
It's like the hottest,

33:27.031 --> 33:29.409
wettest pussy on earth.

33:29.450 --> 33:31.118
What?

33:31.160 --> 33:35.248
That's what fear smells like.

33:37.542 --> 33:41.128
I heard about the boy.

33:41.170 --> 33:44.006
You know, I never
wanted you to get mixed up

33:44.048 --> 33:46.593
with that family
in the first place,

33:46.634 --> 33:48.887
but there's what you want

33:48.928 --> 33:50.889
and then there's what happens,

33:50.930 --> 33:54.016
so what do you think
you end up living with?

33:54.058 --> 33:56.436
We had the same dreams.

33:56.477 --> 33:59.689
I thought that meant something.

33:59.731 --> 34:03.651
The heart is smarter than
the head, even when it isn't.

34:08.155 --> 34:10.199
You are exactly the man

34:10.241 --> 34:12.993
Nicolai knew you'd be.

34:13.034 --> 34:14.995
You really are.

34:15.036 --> 34:18.373
I'd say I don't know
how I got to be so lucky,

34:18.416 --> 34:21.920
but we're Rumanceks, so...

34:23.922 --> 34:27.884
Boy, you just, you don't let
a person get a word in edgewise.

34:27.926 --> 34:30.219
Ah, a smile.

34:30.261 --> 34:33.179
Finally.

34:35.181 --> 34:38.226
Mrs. Godfrey.

34:38.268 --> 34:41.438
There's a tone of a question
in your voice as if we haven't met.

34:41.481 --> 34:44.317
I do have a few,
if you have a moment.

34:54.409 --> 34:56.370
<i>Such a peaceful place.</i>

34:56.411 --> 35:00.458
That is an observation,
not a question.

35:00.500 --> 35:03.711
I did want to ask your opinion about
the upsetting discovery at your mill.

35:03.753 --> 35:07.089
Discoveries, I should say.

35:10.426 --> 35:14.263
- You're a remarkable cunt.
- I'm sorry?

35:14.305 --> 35:17.016
My son is upstairs
in a coma and you come to me

35:17.057 --> 35:20.353
- with questions of what?
- I'm sorry. I didn't know he was here.

35:20.394 --> 35:24.398
And just what did you think
you discovered? Your entire life

35:24.440 --> 35:26.985
is nothing but a question.

35:29.111 --> 35:32.615
Now, either say something
to me worth my time

35:32.657 --> 35:36.536
or go sniff out your animal
and directly fuck off

35:36.577 --> 35:38.913
back to whatever Ohio
tragedy birthed you.

35:38.955 --> 35:41.040
And how did you know Ohio?

35:44.210 --> 35:45.920
I'll pray for your son.

35:45.962 --> 35:48.130
You will do no such thing.

35:48.172 --> 35:50.466
Afraid he'll be saved?

35:52.927 --> 35:54.888
You know, also, the thing

35:54.929 --> 35:58.098
that we all keep
forgetting here--

35:58.140 --> 36:02.269
we're all just animals.

36:02.311 --> 36:04.522
<i>You have to hurry, Roman.</i>

36:04.564 --> 36:08.067
- I didn't realize there was a rush.
- Yes, you did.

36:08.108 --> 36:08.860
Why should I trust you?

36:08.902 --> 36:10.236
<i>Why should I trust you?</i>

36:10.277 --> 36:12.321
You say you're my guide,

36:12.363 --> 36:14.574
but we're not going anywhere.

36:14.615 --> 36:16.826
A labyrinth is
not a maze, Roman.

36:16.868 --> 36:20.162
A maze is designed to mislead. A
labyrinth, no matter which way you step,

36:20.204 --> 36:22.164
you're always going
in the right direction.

36:22.206 --> 36:24.500
It's leading you to the center.
You have to hurry, Roman.

36:24.542 --> 36:27.587
- Why?
- You're running out of time!

36:27.628 --> 36:29.964
You're such a child, Roman.

36:32.008 --> 36:34.218
People are going to die;
you're going to die!

36:34.260 --> 36:37.889
- Shelley!
- Grow up, Roman! No one cares anymore!

36:37.931 --> 36:40.224
I'm sorry! Please come back.
Shelley! Shelley!

36:40.266 --> 36:42.226
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Grow up, Roman!

36:42.268 --> 36:45.271
- We're not here forever.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

36:45.312 --> 36:47.314
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

37:01.370 --> 37:03.748
I'm ready for you!
I'm ready for you!

37:03.790 --> 37:05.499
Here I am! Here I am!

37:52.797 --> 37:56.134
Where the fuck did it go?

38:01.722 --> 38:03.432
Roman!

38:03.474 --> 38:06.060
- Roman, help me!
- No!

38:21.075 --> 38:24.495
No!

38:27.790 --> 38:31.210
Shelley?

38:33.212 --> 38:34.922
Shelley?

38:37.800 --> 38:39.802
What is this?

39:01.407 --> 39:03.743
You are ugly, Roman.

39:03.784 --> 39:07.121
You're looking for a monster?

39:07.163 --> 39:10.541
Look in the coke mirror.

39:10.583 --> 39:12.585
Look in the coke mirror.

39:12.626 --> 39:14.545
Stop!

39:14.587 --> 39:17.631
Ooh... Tsk, tsk, tsk.

39:22.261 --> 39:24.764
What does that mean?

39:42.865 --> 39:45.243
Can I go up yet?

39:45.284 --> 39:48.037
Oh, sweetie,

39:48.079 --> 39:50.414
you've barely
scratched the surface.

39:50.456 --> 39:53.042
You haven't done
what you came here for.

39:53.084 --> 39:55.128
What does the Dragon want
from me?

39:55.169 --> 39:58.756
What do you want from him?
What do you want from him?

40:01.550 --> 40:03.510
You're running out of time.

40:03.552 --> 40:06.555
You must make your heart steel.

40:13.146 --> 40:15.522
Please.

40:15.564 --> 40:18.818
Please forgive me.

40:18.859 --> 40:21.946
I was so fixated on the man
I wanted you to become

40:21.988 --> 40:26.533
that I missed the boy
you still are.

40:28.535 --> 40:30.955
I'm so afraid.

40:30.997 --> 40:35.001
I've spent so many years
building this life for us.

40:37.253 --> 40:40.756
It wouldn't be the first time I broke
something excellent and beautiful

40:40.798 --> 40:43.676
because tightening my grip

40:43.717 --> 40:47.972
comes more naturally to me
than letting go.

40:48.014 --> 40:52.268
I've lost everything before.

40:52.310 --> 40:55.062
Sacrifice, you don't know

40:55.104 --> 40:57.564
the meaning of the word.

40:59.566 --> 41:03.403
It's not in me to lose you,

41:03.445 --> 41:07.533
even if it means letting you go.

41:14.665 --> 41:18.585
Hello.

41:20.587 --> 41:22.715
I brought this. For him.

41:25.301 --> 41:28.179
I thought it might help him

41:28.221 --> 41:29.638
with his... travels.

41:31.640 --> 41:33.642
Thank you. I...

41:33.684 --> 41:35.686
I believe that it will.

41:39.565 --> 41:41.984
- Would you like to come upstairs
and see him? - Ah, no.

41:42.026 --> 41:45.571
I'm actually pretty fucking bad
at these kind of things,

41:45.612 --> 41:48.366
if you want to know
the truth. Yeah.

41:48.407 --> 41:51.327
Well, uh...

41:51.369 --> 41:53.371
Uh, Peter?

41:56.916 --> 41:59.835
Perhaps if he...

41:59.877 --> 42:02.755
had met someone
like you sooner, he...

42:02.796 --> 42:04.798
he wouldn't be where he is now.

42:08.177 --> 42:11.972
Goodbye.

42:35.329 --> 42:37.123
Mm.

42:49.676 --> 42:52.846
We had sex over there.

42:55.599 --> 42:58.811
Don't look so proud
of yourself.

43:23.294 --> 43:26.005
Children.

43:26.046 --> 43:30.176
They're all just children.

44:17.097 --> 44:20.100
The alchemists believed a creative
work has a sort of life all its own,

44:20.142 --> 44:22.936
independent of
the creator, comma,

44:22.978 --> 44:26.148
straddling the worlds
of matter and psyche,

44:26.190 --> 44:28.734
of both and neither.

44:28.775 --> 44:30.736
Full stop.

44:30.777 --> 44:33.239
A subtle body, they called it.

44:33.280 --> 44:35.824
Full stop.

44:35.866 --> 44:38.577
Can you think what
you would do to protect it?

44:38.618 --> 44:40.620
Question mark.

44:42.622 --> 44:46.626
The sedation of the boy was unfortunate,
comma, but in his condition,

44:46.668 --> 44:48.921
as necessary as his witness
to the work.

44:48.962 --> 44:52.258
Full stop. Should he wake,

44:52.299 --> 44:55.719
a report of Ouroboros
will never be believed.

44:55.761 --> 44:58.055
Semicolon.

44:58.097 --> 45:00.849
And knowing the truth,

45:00.891 --> 45:03.561
he is invalidated. Full stop.

45:06.355 --> 45:08.690
They won't stop me.

45:11.777 --> 45:13.737
Then it will all have been

45:13.779 --> 45:15.781
for nothing.

45:22.288 --> 45:25.124
<i>It's taking everything I have
not to lose it.</i>

45:25.165 --> 45:28.835
<i>I want a voice so I can scream!</i>

45:28.877 --> 45:31.464
<i>It hurts so much.</i>

45:31.505 --> 45:34.467
<i>Others can love without hate--</i>

45:34.508 --> 45:36.469
<i>no conditions.</i>

45:36.510 --> 45:38.471
<i>But not you,</i>

45:38.512 --> 45:41.056
<i>not my proud brother Roman.</i>

45:41.098 --> 45:45.144
<i>No, you'd rather die first,</i>

45:45.185 --> 45:47.645
<i>so you take it out
on everyone around you.</i>

45:47.687 --> 45:51.024
<i>You promised you'd always be
here for me,</i>

45:51.066 --> 45:54.694
<i>but you're a liar!
You're selfish and...</i>

45:54.736 --> 45:57.239
<i>and you know
how much I love you,</i>

45:57.281 --> 45:59.908
<i>but I hate you
for making me see it.</i>

45:59.950 --> 46:03.745
<i>I have always defended you,
but I cannot defend this.</i>

46:03.787 --> 46:08.292
<i>You are not allowed
to remove yourself from my life.</i>

46:08.334 --> 46:12.129
<i>Wake up, Roman.
Please, come back.</i>
