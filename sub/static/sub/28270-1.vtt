00:00.001 --> 00:01.419
- I'm running late, you know?
- Incredible.

00:01.421 --> 00:02.646
You're always late!

00:02.648 --> 00:03.068
Mom?

00:03.070 --> 00:05.226
You would be late
for your own funeral.

00:05.228 --> 00:07.154
Kind of speaking
illegally here.

00:07.156 --> 00:07.955
Tanya!

00:08.479 --> 00:09.773
Ugh, Tanya?

00:09.775 --> 00:11.227
- Tanya?
- Yes, Ma?

00:11.229 --> 00:12.808
Something's wrong?

00:12.810 --> 00:14.344
The car is making
some weird noises.

00:14.346 --> 00:16.280
Is something wrong
with the engine?

00:16.282 --> 00:17.315
Tanya?

00:17.682 --> 00:20.711
Ma, I'm hanging up on you now.

00:20.713 --> 00:21.335
Bye!

00:40.439 --> 00:41.239
Oh god.

01:01.427 --> 01:02.260
Sorry.

01:09.968 --> 01:12.503
I wonder what she's up to.

01:31.057 --> 01:32.057
Call them!

01:32.959 --> 01:33.759
I did.

01:35.361 --> 01:37.895
We need to buy the
penthouse, not just visit

01:37.897 --> 01:39.130
or suck on them like others.

01:39.132 --> 01:40.797
Call them again now!

01:40.799 --> 01:41.598
Okay.

01:41.600 --> 01:42.833
This city is dying.

01:42.835 --> 01:44.701
Everything is for sale
and here we are waiting

01:44.703 --> 01:45.970
like some beggars.

01:52.144 --> 01:53.010
Hi!

01:55.915 --> 01:58.916
Hi, it's Brian
Demerius calling again.

01:58.918 --> 02:02.086
Yes, the penthouse in
the Crystal Towers.

02:02.088 --> 02:03.989
We want to see it
during the day.

02:03.991 --> 02:05.992
Any news from the agent?

02:07.427 --> 02:08.061
I see.

02:08.729 --> 02:09.429
Okay.

02:14.001 --> 02:15.001
Come here.

02:15.468 --> 02:16.068
Hi.

02:16.770 --> 02:19.037
Good to see you finally here.

02:20.106 --> 02:22.541
I must see the
penthouse before dark

02:22.543 --> 02:26.043
to decide if Mr. Demerius
will spend his money on it.

02:26.045 --> 02:28.179
I was in a car
accident, sorry.

02:28.181 --> 02:30.181
She must be
freshly off the boat.

02:30.183 --> 02:33.985
Can I please
borrow your phone?

02:33.987 --> 02:34.552
Thank you.

02:35.688 --> 02:37.789
Oh you called my company.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.731
Hi, it's Tanya Coba here.

02:45.931 --> 02:48.198
Can you please send
somebody with another key?

02:48.200 --> 02:49.433
The only key.

02:50.169 --> 02:51.904
I do not believe my ears.

02:51.906 --> 02:55.107
She lost the only keys
to my new penthouse?

02:55.109 --> 02:58.209
My father has another
key from the car.

02:58.211 --> 02:59.978
Where is the car?

03:00.781 --> 03:01.947
I don't know.

03:01.949 --> 03:02.782
Ah...

03:03.516 --> 03:04.917
Okay, thank you, bye.

03:05.853 --> 03:08.686
I was in the metro and
I never use the metro

03:08.688 --> 03:10.989
so I didn't check the station.

03:11.925 --> 03:12.723
Are you insane?

03:12.725 --> 03:14.426
Who forgets their car?

03:15.462 --> 03:17.697
Can I have it once again?

03:21.669 --> 03:23.836
Hi, it's Tanya Coba again.

03:25.104 --> 03:29.108
My father can locate the car
through my GPS in my phone.

03:30.610 --> 03:31.743
Well this is not my phone.

03:31.745 --> 03:32.979
It's my client's.

03:33.813 --> 03:34.645
Oh.

03:34.647 --> 03:35.480
Okay.

03:44.925 --> 03:45.758
Hi.

03:59.508 --> 04:00.138
Bye.

04:00.140 --> 04:00.973
Yeah.

04:06.681 --> 04:09.082
Tanya had her first big sale.

04:10.584 --> 04:12.884
15 million dollars, penthouse!

04:16.790 --> 04:17.923
Congratulations!

05:01.002 --> 05:02.034
Washington Square?

05:02.036 --> 05:03.168
Washington Square?

05:07.108 --> 05:08.908
You cannot tell that
to this generation!

05:08.910 --> 05:10.075
They are wireless!

05:10.077 --> 05:11.743
They do not understand!

05:12.880 --> 05:13.980
It was great.

05:14.949 --> 05:17.015
It was the golden times.

05:17.017 --> 05:20.887
It was the most
beautiful time of my life.

05:22.791 --> 05:23.856
To those times, Barbara.

05:23.858 --> 05:25.125
To those times.

05:30.699 --> 05:33.967
Where did?

05:35.269 --> 05:37.971
It's gonna be just a minute.

05:40.975 --> 05:42.209
You are late!

05:43.077 --> 05:45.044
I had to take the metro.

05:46.648 --> 05:48.115
Can you stop please?

05:48.916 --> 05:49.615
Igor is here.

05:49.617 --> 05:50.250
Igor?

05:50.851 --> 05:51.617
I noticed.

05:52.620 --> 05:53.853
Where is Papa?

05:53.855 --> 05:54.820
I don't know!

05:54.822 --> 05:55.788
Drop it now.

05:56.925 --> 05:59.293
Stop asking me
those questions!

06:11.940 --> 06:15.009
Tanya is late because
she's working for the most

06:15.011 --> 06:18.880
prestigious real estate
agency, Rick Sallow!

06:25.855 --> 06:27.788
The car is fine, sweetheart.

06:27.790 --> 06:28.421
Here you go.

06:28.423 --> 06:29.623
Thank you.

06:31.826 --> 06:33.728
Except for its pride.

06:36.031 --> 06:36.964
My phone?

06:37.233 --> 06:37.932
Here.

06:38.733 --> 06:39.733
Thanks.

06:40.702 --> 06:43.904
I think your boss was
trying to reach you.

06:43.906 --> 06:44.739
No!

06:47.843 --> 06:48.676
I'm fired.

06:49.411 --> 06:50.243
Oh.

06:50.980 --> 06:52.247
Tanya, come to see us.

06:52.249 --> 06:54.016
Tanya, please come!

06:54.785 --> 06:55.850
Igor changed!

06:56.920 --> 06:57.851
He changed so much!

06:57.853 --> 06:59.185
He's grown up man now!

06:59.187 --> 07:00.021
Yes!

07:01.891 --> 07:03.957
Zach has to go out and
Tanya will go with him.

07:03.959 --> 07:04.793
Okay.

07:20.877 --> 07:22.244
I'm back my love.

07:23.012 --> 07:24.278
Welcome home.

07:25.148 --> 07:26.748
Oh what a nice surprise!

07:26.750 --> 07:28.983
It's been such a long time.

07:29.952 --> 07:31.719
Let me look at you.

07:32.322 --> 07:33.421
It's still you!

07:36.726 --> 07:37.892
Still working for the agency?

07:37.894 --> 07:39.293
We're still here.

07:40.396 --> 07:41.762
We've had to downsize a bit.

07:41.764 --> 07:42.497
Oh really?

07:42.499 --> 07:43.798
But still good right?

07:43.800 --> 07:44.899
Oh yeah.

07:44.901 --> 07:47.435
It's just that
really gets more information

07:47.437 --> 07:49.303
for a week at least now.

07:53.478 --> 07:55.110
Go and help Tanya.

08:11.829 --> 08:12.461
Hello?

08:14.398 --> 08:16.065
Britney, can I
stay at your place?

08:16.067 --> 08:16.900
Again?

08:17.502 --> 08:18.835
What happened?

08:19.771 --> 08:22.372
My mom wants me to
date some French idiot.

08:23.307 --> 08:24.140
He cute?

08:24.908 --> 08:25.908
Who cares?

08:26.509 --> 08:27.307
He's a loser.

08:31.782 --> 08:34.081
Why not just tell them
that you need to see a client

08:34.082 --> 08:37.184
and then leave for
a couple of hours?

08:37.854 --> 08:38.352
Hello?

08:42.426 --> 08:44.259
Aren't real estate agents
supposed to be working

08:44.260 --> 08:45.861
late hours anyways?

08:46.530 --> 08:48.764
I was officially fired.

08:50.234 --> 08:51.065
So come.

08:51.067 --> 08:52.167
Oh thank you.

08:52.169 --> 08:53.035
Bye.

09:21.899 --> 09:24.234
Stay here and be good, okay?

09:24.601 --> 09:25.300
I love you.

09:26.070 --> 09:26.903
Okay.

10:44.081 --> 10:45.481
Where is Tanya?

10:46.217 --> 10:47.517
Igor, where is Tanya?

10:48.352 --> 10:50.320
You managed to lose her?

10:50.621 --> 10:51.253
Igor?

10:56.561 --> 10:57.894
I have lost trust.

11:11.576 --> 11:12.441
I'm sorry.

11:12.443 --> 11:13.542
I'm really sorry.

11:13.544 --> 11:14.477
I'm sorry, okay?

11:14.479 --> 11:15.179
I'm sorry.

11:15.447 --> 11:16.145
Igor!

11:19.551 --> 11:20.382
I don't know.

11:20.384 --> 11:21.251
Do something.

11:21.253 --> 11:22.319
I don't know.

11:22.321 --> 11:23.585
We have to go and find her.

11:23.587 --> 11:24.921
I'll go check.

11:39.538 --> 11:41.272
He is not normal.

11:43.375 --> 11:45.241
Last night I didn't
even bother coming home

11:45.243 --> 11:46.576
and he didn't care.

11:47.479 --> 11:48.512
But where have you been?

11:49.147 --> 11:49.646
Working.

11:49.648 --> 11:50.546
What do you think?

11:50.548 --> 11:52.348
We had to deliver
to a German client.

11:53.418 --> 11:54.383
But didn't he know?

11:54.385 --> 11:55.484
Of course he knew!

11:55.486 --> 11:56.585
But still.

11:56.587 --> 11:57.686
Is this good?

11:57.688 --> 11:59.155
I love these.

11:59.558 --> 12:00.590
Can I have?

12:00.592 --> 12:01.425
Sure.

12:02.628 --> 12:05.496
Any normal guy would
ask where are you honey?

12:05.498 --> 12:06.430
Where have you been?

12:06.432 --> 12:07.432
But not Tom!

12:08.333 --> 12:09.266
He's so indifferent.

12:10.235 --> 12:12.737
Was he like that when
you were dating him?

12:12.739 --> 12:14.506
I don't remember.

12:15.375 --> 12:17.375
It's been a long time ago.

12:18.344 --> 12:21.346
He was just this guy
with simple needs.

12:22.148 --> 12:23.114
He's simple.

12:27.720 --> 12:29.552
Maybe you can
simply take him back.

12:29.554 --> 12:30.588
Where's Shamu?

12:30.590 --> 12:31.423
Who?

12:41.133 --> 12:42.365
I wanna live.

12:43.134 --> 12:44.067
I want to create.

12:47.272 --> 12:49.406
I don't want this anymore.

12:53.346 --> 12:55.379
Children are asleep.

12:55.782 --> 12:56.480
Hi, Tanya.

12:57.817 --> 12:58.649
Wow.

13:01.354 --> 13:03.355
I don't want him back.

13:10.062 --> 13:10.694
I don't believe it.

13:10.696 --> 13:12.364
Put on your glasses.

13:19.438 --> 13:21.704
My god, she's boarding
the metro again!

13:21.706 --> 13:24.208
She's boarding the metro
for the second time today.

13:24.210 --> 13:26.377
She's putting
her life at risk!

13:37.623 --> 13:39.090
I really can't believe it.

13:39.092 --> 13:40.124
She's doing it.

13:40.126 --> 13:41.059
Look, look.

13:44.331 --> 13:45.364
Yeah.

13:46.232 --> 13:47.199
Are you sure that's her?

14:32.547 --> 14:33.379
Morning.

14:34.182 --> 14:34.815
Coffee?

14:37.351 --> 14:38.184
Bye!

14:39.354 --> 14:40.353
Thank you.

14:41.855 --> 14:43.523
Any time, sweetie.

14:55.202 --> 14:58.337
I wanted a.

15:01.909 --> 15:02.741
Coffee?

15:05.379 --> 15:06.379
Thank you.

15:07.315 --> 15:08.247
Igor was a mistake.

15:08.249 --> 15:09.282
Tanya!

15:09.817 --> 15:12.318
Please come back home.

15:12.320 --> 15:14.287
How did you even find me?

15:14.522 --> 15:15.222
Seriously?

15:17.292 --> 15:18.325
This...

15:18.894 --> 15:19.726
Ha.

15:21.964 --> 15:22.797
Tanya!

15:23.532 --> 15:24.465
Wait, wait, wait!

15:25.333 --> 15:27.300
It belongs to the agency.

15:36.510 --> 15:37.142
Search!

15:47.355 --> 15:48.421
We have to find it!

15:48.423 --> 15:49.255
Yes.

15:52.759 --> 15:53.559
Cellular!

15:57.831 --> 15:58.763
Here, maybe here!

15:58.765 --> 15:59.533
Yeah.

16:02.836 --> 16:03.836
Where is it?

16:04.639 --> 16:05.437
There!

16:10.412 --> 16:11.245
Ah!

16:35.870 --> 16:37.637
I like your running outfit.

16:37.639 --> 16:38.504
Thank you.

16:38.506 --> 16:40.240
It's very original.

16:41.376 --> 16:42.209
Yeah.

16:43.312 --> 16:44.978
Hey, if you need a
breather, there's a good spot

16:44.980 --> 16:46.012
to stretch around the bush.

16:46.014 --> 16:47.381
No, I can't stop.

16:47.383 --> 16:49.016
You feel better
after stretching.

16:49.018 --> 16:50.350
Oh, thank you.

16:50.817 --> 16:51.650
Okay.

17:03.965 --> 17:05.265
Let me guess.

17:06.769 --> 17:08.768
You are running from a lover.

17:08.770 --> 17:09.803
Oh I wish.

17:11.307 --> 17:12.306
Creditors?

17:12.906 --> 17:13.740
Worse.

17:15.044 --> 17:17.376
What could be worse
than death and taxes?

17:17.377 --> 17:18.243
My parents.

17:19.615 --> 17:21.080
They must be in
pretty good shape then.

17:21.083 --> 17:23.382
Yeah.

17:23.384 --> 17:25.484
You know I feel like life
is too short and beautiful

17:25.487 --> 17:27.921
to be complaining
about our parents.

17:27.923 --> 17:29.323
I'm not complaining.

17:29.325 --> 17:30.324
Every woman has a complaint.

17:30.326 --> 17:31.924
For you, it's your
parents, while most women

17:31.926 --> 17:33.093
complain about dieting.

17:33.095 --> 17:33.928
Oh.

17:34.663 --> 17:35.862
You got that right.

17:35.864 --> 17:38.364
I mean about dieting
cause if you're a woman

17:38.366 --> 17:42.536
and you want to stay slim,
according to today's standards,

17:42.538 --> 17:47.008
the only way how to eat is
in front of the mirror naked.

17:50.480 --> 17:53.014
Well, as much as I would
love to see that I think

17:53.016 --> 17:56.484
I should probably try and
ask her out on a date first.

17:56.486 --> 17:57.319
Yeah.

18:06.663 --> 18:07.628
This is my card.

18:07.630 --> 18:08.629
Great.

18:08.631 --> 18:10.131
So I'll see you tomorrow
at the breakfast place.

18:10.133 --> 18:10.797
Okay.

18:10.799 --> 18:11.899
Okay awesome.

18:11.901 --> 18:13.668
You know, it's such a happy
coincidence that you're

18:13.670 --> 18:14.403
a real estate agent.

18:15.371 --> 18:16.370
My condo, that thing's
been up for sale for

18:16.372 --> 18:17.536
God knows how long now.

18:17.538 --> 18:18.572
Really?

18:18.574 --> 18:19.573
Yeah, it feels like forever.

18:19.575 --> 18:22.007
It doesn't surprise me
but I'm more than happy

18:22.009 --> 18:22.942
to help you.

18:22.944 --> 18:23.744
Great.

18:23.746 --> 18:24.578
Awesome.

18:25.913 --> 18:28.148
By the way, cell
phone's not valid anymore.

18:28.150 --> 18:29.749
I will replace it tomorrow.

18:29.751 --> 18:30.584
Okay.

18:31.753 --> 18:32.986
I'm not that easy
to reach either.

18:32.988 --> 18:34.488
I work in a hospital
as a brain surgeon

18:34.490 --> 18:36.655
so I gotta keep my phone
off at all times in there.

18:36.657 --> 18:37.924
Well I will never disturb you.

18:37.926 --> 18:38.759
I promise.

18:40.864 --> 18:46.033
Home address not valid either
and employer either, so...

18:46.035 --> 18:48.736
Well I'm really glad
you gave me the card then.

18:48.738 --> 18:49.836
Make sure not to lose it.

18:49.838 --> 18:53.841
Well, so bye and oh.

19:03.452 --> 19:04.385
Gotta go.

19:05.054 --> 19:06.655
See you tomorrow.

19:12.561 --> 19:13.561
Thank you.

19:25.074 --> 19:26.641
I'm so happy to see you.

19:26.643 --> 19:27.642
Tom left us!

19:27.912 --> 19:28.944
No!

19:31.015 --> 19:31.848
So sorry.

19:33.217 --> 19:35.984
Said he'll be gone for
four days on a business trip!

19:35.986 --> 19:36.986
Four days?

19:37.654 --> 19:38.086
Okay.

19:39.622 --> 19:41.221
What am I gonna do
with all this house work?

19:41.223 --> 19:43.557
I can't clean or cook.

19:43.559 --> 19:45.992
Who's gonna take care
of my little sweet rads?

19:45.994 --> 19:46.994
Well, you.

19:48.464 --> 19:49.630
Are you out of your mind?

19:49.632 --> 19:51.566
I have to find a nanny.

19:52.701 --> 19:54.568
Did you say that you
were out of a job?

19:54.570 --> 19:56.136
Could you help out
maybe for a bit?

19:56.138 --> 19:59.006
Well my situation has changed.

19:59.776 --> 20:00.674
Has changed.

20:00.676 --> 20:01.509
How so?

20:02.246 --> 20:04.479
So his name is
Dr. Steve Press.

20:05.682 --> 20:06.980
Where did you meet this guy?

20:06.982 --> 20:07.882
When did this happen?

20:07.884 --> 20:09.917
I was running at the park.

20:09.919 --> 20:10.884
At the park.

20:10.886 --> 20:11.720
This park?

20:11.988 --> 20:12.921
Wow.

20:13.789 --> 20:15.523
And he's the best kisser ever!

20:15.525 --> 20:16.958
You kissed him?

20:17.760 --> 20:18.827
In this park!

20:19.797 --> 20:22.698
Been here 10 years,
I've never met anybody.

20:22.700 --> 20:23.533
Wow!

20:23.933 --> 20:24.932
Yeah I know.

20:24.934 --> 20:25.968
You have kids, right?

20:25.970 --> 20:27.470
So it's kind of...

20:30.106 --> 20:32.940
You can at least come
help out for a day.

20:32.942 --> 20:33.843
Just today.

20:34.545 --> 20:35.010
Okay.

20:35.211 --> 20:35.877
Okay.

20:56.067 --> 20:57.834
You have no idea who I am.

20:57.836 --> 20:59.168
You never understand me.

20:59.170 --> 21:00.903
You never listen to me.

21:00.905 --> 21:05.073
I told you many times that I
don't like French restaurant.

21:05.075 --> 21:05.974
There's a brain here.

21:05.976 --> 21:07.677
I'm not an animal.

21:08.078 --> 21:08.878
Give me the key.

21:09.647 --> 21:10.179
I'm leaving.

21:10.981 --> 21:11.780
I'm leaving!

21:11.782 --> 21:12.782
Give me the keys.

21:13.817 --> 21:15.617
Why are you laughing at me?

21:15.619 --> 21:16.952
Stop looking at me like this!

21:16.954 --> 21:19.589
You look like a stupid robot!

21:20.325 --> 21:21.690
I'm talking to you, Brian!

21:21.692 --> 21:22.859
Say something!

21:23.929 --> 21:24.827
I'm done.

21:25.297 --> 21:25.962
What?

21:26.964 --> 21:27.897
I'm done!

21:28.933 --> 21:32.735
Oh you're done.

21:33.305 --> 21:34.237
Take the penthouse.

21:34.239 --> 21:35.506
Take the car.

21:35.941 --> 21:36.839
I'm done.

21:40.010 --> 21:41.010
Brian?

21:45.817 --> 21:48.249
I got the penthouse.

21:56.126 --> 21:57.293
There it is.

21:57.963 --> 21:58.796
Yep.

22:00.231 --> 22:03.902
I only need a power supply
and the device should work.

22:08.974 --> 22:09.606
What?

22:11.076 --> 22:13.611
Power supply for the device.

22:13.613 --> 22:15.846
What are you talking about?

22:16.982 --> 22:20.050
What are you talking
about when our daughter

22:21.653 --> 22:24.989
is unsupervised, not
protected somewhere

22:25.857 --> 22:27.825
under the snow maybe crying?

22:31.796 --> 22:35.265
I don't understand.

22:52.652 --> 22:54.951
You sure you don't
wanna go to your parents?

22:54.953 --> 22:57.254
It's been like three
days you haven't changed.

22:57.256 --> 22:59.922
Why so much concern
about my look?

22:59.924 --> 23:02.825
Because obviously most
people aren't blind.

23:02.827 --> 23:04.361
Well I can't go back there.

23:04.363 --> 23:06.798
I wish I had what you have.

23:07.866 --> 23:10.700
What do I have
that you don't have?

23:10.702 --> 23:12.336
Normal human family.

23:12.938 --> 23:13.838
Ha, family.

23:14.807 --> 23:17.775
Family is supposed to
mean so much to me.

23:17.777 --> 23:19.843
Well, I'll give you a
piece of advice, sweetie.

23:19.845 --> 23:23.313
Think twice before you fall
into your Mr. Perfect Kiss.

23:23.315 --> 23:25.216
Children are overrated.

23:26.818 --> 23:27.918
Believe me.

23:28.854 --> 23:30.989
I know a little
something about it.

24:13.732 --> 24:15.799
Where is she going now?

24:30.282 --> 24:31.115
Hi.

24:31.785 --> 24:33.249
Hi.

24:45.231 --> 24:48.067
Mom, dad, what are
you doing here?

24:49.536 --> 24:50.802
We found your phone.

24:50.804 --> 24:51.836
No!

24:52.839 --> 24:56.240
Listen, I'm 30 years old
and I've been covering

24:56.242 --> 24:57.909
for you all my life.

24:58.511 --> 24:59.243
You know what?

25:00.413 --> 25:01.845
From now on, I'm not
sacrificing myself

25:01.847 --> 25:03.547
for your stupid mission anymore.

25:03.549 --> 25:04.782
Ha.

25:07.253 --> 25:08.085
Hey.

25:08.087 --> 25:08.921
Hi.

25:10.056 --> 25:11.789
Why did you give
that guy?

25:11.791 --> 25:13.557
You don't know what I
have to put up with here.

25:13.559 --> 25:15.293
What was I to do?

25:15.295 --> 25:17.461
Can't live with
my parents anymore.

25:17.463 --> 25:20.398
You're the stupidest
man on earth!

25:20.400 --> 25:22.834
Why don't you just give
me two or three months rent

25:22.836 --> 25:24.235
on the condo and then
you can just live there

25:24.237 --> 25:25.738
until you sell it?

25:26.306 --> 25:26.971
Really?

25:28.541 --> 25:29.374
Thank you.

25:30.109 --> 25:30.909
You're so generous.

25:30.911 --> 25:32.845
Here's the address.

25:38.317 --> 25:40.117
See you there tonight.

25:41.354 --> 25:42.487
I got an emergency
at the hospital.

25:42.489 --> 25:44.988
It must be beautiful
to save lives.

25:44.990 --> 25:46.057
I gotta go.

25:49.229 --> 25:53.398
Oh, do you still have those
Excel lease contracts?

25:54.000 --> 25:54.465
Yeah sure.

25:55.701 --> 25:56.867
I just figured, you know,
I could use it as a template.

25:56.869 --> 26:01.305
Oh, I must have forgotten
them at my friend's house.

26:01.307 --> 26:02.141
I'm sorry.

26:02.541 --> 26:03.474
No worries.

26:03.476 --> 26:05.511
Just bring them over tonight.

26:06.446 --> 26:07.813
I'll see you soon.

26:13.988 --> 26:14.988
Seriously?

26:17.525 --> 26:19.959
I can't believe you people.

26:23.564 --> 26:24.630
Tanya, darling, please!

26:24.632 --> 26:26.030
He's not for real!

26:26.032 --> 26:27.632
Anybody who approaches
me is not for real

26:27.634 --> 26:29.567
except for your Russian idiot.

26:29.569 --> 26:31.336
You should pay
respect to your mother.

26:31.338 --> 26:33.271
Where am I not
paying respect to her?

26:33.273 --> 26:35.274
Don't talk to your
father like that!

26:35.276 --> 26:38.611
Sometimes I really would
wish to get closer to you.

26:38.613 --> 26:40.578
Just to understand how
can you go through life

26:40.580 --> 26:42.848
with no brain whatsoever.

26:43.482 --> 26:46.018
You know why I hate bullies?

26:46.553 --> 26:48.554
They're so despicable.

27:00.067 --> 27:01.334
Are you kidding me?

27:02.569 --> 27:04.470
I will call the police.

27:48.451 --> 27:50.718
My parents locked
me in my room

27:50.720 --> 27:52.486
and Dr. Press is waiting for me.

27:52.488 --> 27:54.721
I cannot get out
of my apartment.

27:54.723 --> 27:56.990
Why is it that all
good things in this life

27:56.992 --> 27:58.326
are bad for you?

27:59.528 --> 28:02.462
Either they're perverse
or makes us gain weight.

28:02.464 --> 28:03.564
Did you drink?

28:03.566 --> 28:04.932
No, not yet.

28:05.467 --> 28:06.632
I'm begging you.

28:06.634 --> 28:08.168
Can you please
come to his place?

28:08.170 --> 28:10.603
This is
talking for me.

28:10.605 --> 28:12.471
He wants me to see his condo.

28:12.473 --> 28:13.405
Just call him.

28:13.407 --> 28:14.373
I already did.

28:14.375 --> 28:16.375
He doesn't pick up the phone.

28:16.377 --> 28:18.378
He must be in a surgery.

28:19.513 --> 28:21.280
And what does all
this have to do with me?

28:21.282 --> 28:23.482
Well I forgot the
documents at your place.

28:23.484 --> 28:24.517
So?

28:25.487 --> 28:28.354
Dr. Press is expecting
to get them tonight!

28:28.356 --> 28:29.289
I get it.

28:30.025 --> 28:30.624
Dr. Perfect Kiss.

28:31.492 --> 28:32.326
Exactly.

28:33.060 --> 28:33.727
Dr. Perfect Kiss.

28:33.729 --> 28:34.827
Will you please go there?

28:34.829 --> 28:37.131
I'm scared that if he
finds out what a loser I am

28:37.133 --> 28:39.433
he won't deal with me anymore.

28:40.236 --> 28:41.369
Okay I'll go.

28:41.371 --> 28:46.673
But only if you promise to
babysit my kids every time

28:46.675 --> 28:47.674
Tom goes away.

28:47.676 --> 28:49.410
Thank you, thank you!

28:49.711 --> 28:50.545
Bye.

28:55.384 --> 28:56.417
Yes!

29:20.509 --> 29:21.343
Hello?

29:24.747 --> 29:25.580
Hello?

29:29.586 --> 29:30.419
Oh.

29:31.220 --> 29:31.653
I'm sorry.

29:32.454 --> 29:33.387
I'm gonna go.

29:35.590 --> 29:36.423
No.

29:37.093 --> 29:37.726
No, no.

29:38.326 --> 29:39.394
Yes, yes, yes.

29:42.198 --> 29:43.031
Come in.

29:43.432 --> 29:44.331
I insist.

29:44.333 --> 29:47.235
No, no.

29:48.538 --> 29:49.371
No.

29:50.472 --> 29:54.608
Yes, yes, yes.

30:18.102 --> 30:20.636
Rex Realty, how
can I help you?

30:20.837 --> 30:22.805
Hi, Tanya Coba please.

30:24.273 --> 30:25.573
One moment, sir.

30:29.113 --> 30:32.414
I'm sorry, sir, she's
no longer with us.

30:32.648 --> 30:33.448
Oh, do you know?

30:34.750 --> 30:35.550
Hello?

30:37.121 --> 30:37.720
Hello?

34:28.518 --> 34:30.018
Why did they spit on it?

34:30.021 --> 34:32.690
I don't know,
just for good luck.

34:32.692 --> 34:35.891
I thought it was some
kind of new DNA code.

34:35.893 --> 34:40.898
No, they're just coming up
with a new one while you're in.

34:42.001 --> 34:44.001
What about eye recognition
and fingerprints?

34:44.003 --> 34:45.304
Can't help?

34:45.704 --> 34:46.938
No good anymore?

34:46.940 --> 34:48.139
Apparently it's very
difficult to extract

34:48.141 --> 34:49.407
fresh from the body.

34:49.409 --> 34:50.041
Oh.

35:15.802 --> 35:16.633
Hi.

35:16.635 --> 35:17.934
Stranger danger.

35:17.936 --> 35:18.936
I'm not a stranger.

35:18.938 --> 35:19.771
Oh.

35:20.739 --> 35:21.972
Brian Demerius.

35:22.909 --> 35:24.076
Ah, I remember you.

35:24.943 --> 35:27.378
How's your stunning beauty?

35:28.914 --> 35:30.414
Did you buy the condo?

35:30.416 --> 35:31.650
Actually yes.

35:33.119 --> 35:34.017
Good for you.

35:34.019 --> 35:35.052
Good for her.

35:35.054 --> 35:36.487
Good for all of you.

35:36.489 --> 35:37.923
Have a nice life!

35:38.525 --> 35:39.624
It's cold out.

35:39.626 --> 35:40.959
You want a ride?

35:42.027 --> 35:43.795
I'll take you
anywhere you wanna go.

35:43.797 --> 35:46.630
Where I wanna go or
wherever you wanna go?

35:46.632 --> 35:52.637
Cause you know I have a date
and you're kind of in my way.

35:52.639 --> 35:53.338
So bye.

35:53.340 --> 35:54.805
Wait, you have a morning date?

35:54.807 --> 35:55.507
Yes.

35:55.509 --> 35:56.575
Well then it can't be serious.

35:56.577 --> 35:59.142
Is there some kind of
policy that you can't have

35:59.144 --> 36:01.912
a morning date here
that I don't know about?

36:01.914 --> 36:03.916
Well you can't date in
the morning and be serious.

36:03.918 --> 36:05.150
If it's a dinner date...

36:05.152 --> 36:07.052
It wasn't supposed to be a
morning date but I was locked

36:07.054 --> 36:08.753
in my apartment and I
couldn't get out and my...

36:08.755 --> 36:12.958
Did you just say you were
locked in your apartment?

36:14.128 --> 36:15.494
Anyway, it's none of
your business, okay?

36:15.496 --> 36:16.128
Bye.

36:17.132 --> 36:19.731
Would you just let me
give you a ride please?

36:19.733 --> 36:21.134
I don't think so.

36:22.503 --> 36:24.970
I'm good with metro
because now I know how

36:24.972 --> 36:26.672
to buy the ticket.

36:26.907 --> 36:27.874
Bye.

36:32.978 --> 36:33.911
Hey, come on in.

36:33.913 --> 36:34.945
Hi.

36:35.514 --> 36:36.046
How are you?

36:36.048 --> 36:36.880
Good.

36:36.882 --> 36:37.882
Have a seat.

36:38.485 --> 36:39.117
Here.

36:40.487 --> 36:42.186
Go ahead, just have
a seat over here.

36:42.188 --> 36:43.688
Here's the lease form.

36:43.690 --> 36:44.722
Just sign here.

36:44.724 --> 36:46.124
Oh it's freezing.

36:50.028 --> 36:51.061
There.

36:51.597 --> 36:52.195
Great.

36:52.197 --> 36:52.864
Payment?

36:53.199 --> 36:53.932
Right now?

36:53.934 --> 36:54.634
Yeah.

36:57.036 --> 36:58.836
Can I give you a check?

36:58.838 --> 36:59.672
Sure.

37:04.644 --> 37:06.043
No, no, don't write my name.

37:06.045 --> 37:07.112
Don't write my name.

37:07.114 --> 37:08.947
Just write cash, okay?

37:11.784 --> 37:12.617
I can do that?

37:12.619 --> 37:13.452
Yes.

37:13.987 --> 37:14.987
I'm a doctor, okay?

37:14.989 --> 37:15.887
I know what's best.

37:15.889 --> 37:16.922
Cash.

37:17.157 --> 37:17.890
Cash.

37:22.630 --> 37:24.030
Great, thank you.

37:26.699 --> 37:28.066
Don't worry, my sweetest.

37:28.068 --> 37:30.135
I just have to go to
the hospital, okay?

37:30.137 --> 37:30.969
Oh.

37:30.971 --> 37:32.003
I'll see you soon.

37:32.005 --> 37:32.838
Okay.

37:33.106 --> 37:33.905
Okay.

38:39.873 --> 38:40.940
Who's this guy?

39:05.833 --> 39:08.067
I wonder, this Steve Press.

39:24.418 --> 39:25.251
What?

39:29.289 --> 39:31.657
Dr. Steve and Tanya Press.

39:56.317 --> 39:57.150
oh!

39:59.387 --> 40:00.687
Boo, boo!

40:01.121 --> 40:01.954
Oh.

40:04.059 --> 40:04.891
Oh.

40:24.246 --> 40:25.079
Igor!

40:26.215 --> 40:28.216
What are you doing here?

40:31.853 --> 40:33.820
Did my parents send you?

40:34.724 --> 40:35.722
Do they think I'm stupid?

40:35.724 --> 40:36.324
Oh!

40:37.059 --> 40:38.224
I own this place.

40:38.226 --> 40:39.893
This is my castle.

40:40.329 --> 40:41.161
This is my home!

40:41.163 --> 40:42.063
This is my lease!

40:42.965 --> 40:45.066
You have no right to be here!

40:46.400 --> 40:47.400
Show me the lease.

40:47.402 --> 40:48.233
What?

40:48.235 --> 40:49.769
Show me the lease.

40:49.771 --> 40:50.202
I can't.

40:57.846 --> 40:58.911
Here.

41:12.862 --> 41:14.896
What's wrong with you?

41:20.034 --> 41:20.467
Oh.

41:23.838 --> 41:25.440
I can't believe it.

41:27.143 --> 41:29.077
Tearing apart my stuff.

41:30.213 --> 41:33.148
Oh you're even a bigger
loser than I thought!

41:34.851 --> 41:36.218
What do you want?

41:36.987 --> 41:38.253
You have no lease.

41:40.523 --> 41:41.923
Fire the lease.

42:01.512 --> 42:03.146
Don't touch me!

42:06.818 --> 42:07.817
I'm sorry.

42:23.300 --> 42:24.298
Watch out.

42:25.168 --> 42:27.102
It arrived this morning.

42:30.539 --> 42:31.505
Already open it up?

42:31.507 --> 42:32.540
No.

42:33.443 --> 42:34.443
You open it.

42:47.458 --> 42:51.427
Comrades, the most
difficult economic situation,

42:51.429 --> 42:54.195
much important decrease of
jobs that occurred in your area

42:54.197 --> 42:56.498
in the past two, is that
supposed to be English?

42:56.500 --> 42:57.532
Who cares?

42:57.534 --> 42:58.801
Just read it.

43:00.070 --> 43:03.472
We announce you that we are
closing your operational cell.

43:04.141 --> 43:06.575
Decision is final
and unrevocable.

43:06.577 --> 43:10.345
We are ordering to
immediate return

43:10.347 --> 43:11.947
of all un-destroyed evidence.

43:11.949 --> 43:13.548
What about my inventions?

43:13.550 --> 43:14.617
Oh my god.

43:14.619 --> 43:18.153
The teddy bear with the
camera inside the bow tie.

43:18.155 --> 43:18.988
Oh my!

43:19.657 --> 43:21.524
We are declared destitute.

43:24.527 --> 43:28.163
With no profile station
in Paris, France.

43:40.978 --> 43:43.246
Always obey the motherland!

44:09.974 --> 44:11.441
So sorry for that.

44:12.376 --> 44:13.008
Such a great dog.

44:16.681 --> 44:19.548
Sorry for all that perfect kiss.

44:23.454 --> 44:24.889
Such a great dog.

44:27.458 --> 44:29.993
Oh I'm sorry for your lease.

44:30.594 --> 44:31.227
I'm so sorry.

44:32.496 --> 44:34.563
I'm sorry for your lease, too.

44:34.565 --> 44:36.933
Oh you do speak English?

44:37.536 --> 44:38.168
Good for you.

44:41.639 --> 44:42.271
It's him.

45:15.673 --> 45:16.507
Got him!

45:17.009 --> 45:18.508
Would you get off of me?

45:18.510 --> 45:19.342
What is this?

45:19.344 --> 45:20.309
Who are you?

45:20.311 --> 45:21.711
Oh you live here.

45:22.447 --> 45:23.313
Yeah I live here.

45:23.315 --> 45:23.780
Would you stop?

45:23.782 --> 45:24.481
Stop it.

45:25.282 --> 45:25.949
He lives here.

45:27.585 --> 45:29.419
Do you have a lease?

45:29.653 --> 45:30.552
What?

45:30.554 --> 45:31.688
I don't need a lease.

45:31.690 --> 45:32.356
I live here.

45:33.358 --> 45:35.657
I'm calling the police
on you two right now.

45:35.659 --> 45:38.528
No, don't call the police, no.

45:39.231 --> 45:39.795
Are you insane?

45:39.797 --> 45:41.264
Don't touch me!

45:41.800 --> 45:43.200
You lost your minds?

45:43.467 --> 45:44.134
No.

45:44.835 --> 45:47.270
I know you from the pictures.

45:47.539 --> 45:48.339
What?

45:48.739 --> 45:50.206
You look good.

45:50.775 --> 45:51.775
You're crazy.

45:51.777 --> 45:52.608
No.

45:53.545 --> 45:54.543
You're actually crazy.

45:54.545 --> 45:57.513
No.

46:06.125 --> 46:07.425
Dr. Steve Press.

46:08.494 --> 46:09.760
What an asshole this guy is.

46:09.762 --> 46:10.394
You know him?

46:10.396 --> 46:11.561
Yeah we met in the park.

46:11.563 --> 46:13.063
Oh me too.

46:14.500 --> 46:16.566
He likes those big
juicy ladies like me.

46:16.568 --> 46:18.536
You're way too skinny.

46:18.538 --> 46:19.371
Oh!

46:20.206 --> 46:21.405
Hey what's the matter?

46:21.407 --> 46:22.407
I got fat!

46:23.375 --> 46:24.507
You know what?

46:24.509 --> 46:25.340
I should call the police.

46:25.342 --> 46:26.409
No, no, no!

46:27.411 --> 46:28.444
Sorry.

46:30.514 --> 46:32.016
I hate cleaning.

46:32.550 --> 46:33.650
Might be pregnant.

46:33.652 --> 46:34.485
What?

46:36.788 --> 46:38.489
Okay you can stay.

46:39.458 --> 46:40.623
But can you clean?

46:40.625 --> 46:41.724
Can you cook?

46:42.594 --> 46:44.762
Okay you'll clean and you cook.

46:48.432 --> 46:51.168
I have a shirt just like that.

46:51.804 --> 46:53.237
Actually this is yours.

46:53.239 --> 46:54.405
Can I keep it?

46:54.407 --> 46:56.740
I mean I look way better
in it than you do but sure.

46:56.742 --> 46:57.742
Thank you.

46:58.643 --> 47:01.178
Oh don't forget that vase.

47:01.581 --> 47:02.514
It's disgusting.

47:05.418 --> 47:06.483
You know what?

47:06.485 --> 47:08.786
This might work out after all.

47:29.608 --> 47:32.143
Do you have any detergent?

47:33.813 --> 47:36.380
How do you live in such a mess?

47:36.382 --> 47:38.481
Don't worry about it, baby.

47:38.483 --> 47:39.316
You know what?

47:39.318 --> 47:40.351
Come over here.

47:40.353 --> 47:41.820
Come see the doctor.

47:43.190 --> 47:46.291
I'll give you a
check-up.

47:59.739 --> 48:01.472
Beautiful ladies, beautiful!

48:01.474 --> 48:02.539

48:48.556 --> 48:48.987
Hit a squat.

48:48.989 --> 48:50.255
Hit a squat.

48:50.257 --> 48:50.822
Let's go, let's go.

48:50.824 --> 48:51.490
Oh, you got it.

48:51.492 --> 48:52.557
You know what you're doing.

48:52.559 --> 48:53.626
Come on. Don't be shy.

48:57.632 --> 48:58.331
What is this?

48:58.333 --> 48:59.365
I say stop?

48:59.701 --> 49:00.633
Did I say stop?

49:00.635 --> 49:01.635
Come on ladies.

49:02.369 --> 49:03.369
It's cold out here.

49:03.371 --> 49:04.369
Keep yourself warm!

49:04.371 --> 49:05.204
Come on.

49:05.472 --> 49:05.938

49:31.298 --> 49:32.398
I love you, Tanya!

49:36.637 --> 49:38.270
We're together.

49:38.806 --> 49:39.639
Oh no.

49:40.307 --> 49:40.739
No.

49:47.547 --> 49:48.447
Ah, no, no!

49:49.416 --> 49:50.482
I don't want!

49:50.918 --> 49:51.585
No!

50:04.032 --> 50:05.265
Come on.

50:13.074 --> 50:13.907
Come on.

50:22.751 --> 50:23.584
Hi.

50:24.052 --> 50:24.719
No.

50:25.086 --> 50:26.052
This right here?

50:26.054 --> 50:27.320
Here, all this?

50:27.322 --> 50:28.355
These are mine.

50:28.990 --> 50:29.690
Just an apple.

50:30.525 --> 50:31.758
You see it starts
with an apple.

50:31.760 --> 50:32.793
Then it's a whole damn turkey.

50:32.795 --> 50:33.927
I'm not having it.

50:33.929 --> 50:34.729
Geez.

50:39.000 --> 50:40.800
Don't call me names.

50:44.338 --> 50:46.005
I have to find us work.

50:46.974 --> 50:48.375
We have to eat!

50:55.382 --> 50:57.782
What do you think
this is, a free ride?

50:57.784 --> 50:59.952
March over to the kitchen.

51:00.755 --> 51:02.289
Place is a mess!

51:03.726 --> 51:04.557
Come on.

52:56.873 --> 52:58.173
What'd you want?

53:01.210 --> 53:02.910
I need somebody.

53:03.612 --> 53:04.512
How much?

53:05.949 --> 53:06.782
Huh?

53:08.083 --> 53:12.019
Well, my situation has
changed and I need money.

53:14.623 --> 53:18.793
How much do you offer
for babysitting?

53:21.864 --> 53:22.696
Really?

53:23.233 --> 53:24.966
Can you come over now?

53:25.766 --> 53:26.433
Well sure.

53:27.268 --> 53:28.535
Thank you.

55:05.835 --> 55:07.568
What happened here?

55:15.945 --> 55:16.878
Oh, oh, oh!

55:27.826 --> 55:28.824
It's hard!

55:30.195 --> 55:31.028
I'm sorry.

55:37.902 --> 55:39.135
Britney left me.

55:39.137 --> 55:41.872
Yeah for a
business trip right?

55:42.673 --> 55:43.574
No, forever.

55:45.342 --> 55:46.175
What?

55:49.179 --> 55:50.813
Wake up the kids!

56:01.027 --> 56:02.959
Don't tell anybody about this.

56:04.963 --> 56:05.797
Okay.

56:06.065 --> 56:06.965
Yep.

56:10.202 --> 56:11.269
She's gone.

56:45.436 --> 56:48.838
You know I'm still wondering
how we're gonna let Tanya

56:48.840 --> 56:51.942
know that we've been
moving to Paris.

56:52.744 --> 56:53.644
Don't worry.

56:54.313 --> 56:56.780
Sharka told me she has a plan.

56:57.849 --> 56:59.851
She used to be our best agent.

57:13.199 --> 57:14.132
Sir, sir!

57:18.170 --> 57:20.470
My train's leaving
from 7:30 to 8:30, hon.

57:20.472 --> 57:21.304
I know.

57:23.509 --> 57:26.876
I was thinking you're
doing so much for humanity

57:26.878 --> 57:30.447
and you know, this is
potassium, home-made.

57:31.916 --> 57:32.916
Thank you.

57:33.786 --> 57:34.751
I only eat biological though.

57:34.753 --> 57:35.987
It's organic.

57:36.789 --> 57:37.387
Full bag of it.

57:37.389 --> 57:38.856
Oh wow, thank you.

57:38.858 --> 57:40.057
I am a big fan.

57:40.391 --> 57:41.324
Is that so?

57:41.827 --> 57:42.291
Yeah.

57:42.293 --> 57:42.959
Arnold.

57:42.961 --> 57:43.894
Sharka.

57:44.429 --> 57:45.362
Nice to meet you.

57:45.364 --> 57:46.295
Nice to meet you.

57:46.297 --> 57:47.764
Alright, see you later.

58:04.550 --> 58:05.416
Oh.

58:09.121 --> 58:09.954
Yeah.

58:13.492 --> 58:14.158
Coffee?

58:14.793 --> 58:15.792
No thanks.

58:25.103 --> 58:27.436
Can you please stop
crying already?

58:33.112 --> 58:35.047
Okay, did you call her?

58:36.048 --> 58:36.882
Yeah.

58:37.818 --> 58:38.884
Did you call her work?

58:41.954 --> 58:42.954
How can you eat?

58:43.556 --> 58:44.789
I need energy!

58:45.358 --> 58:46.525
I need energy!

58:48.929 --> 58:50.461
You know what?

58:50.463 --> 58:52.030
She told me that she's
working with some German.

58:52.032 --> 58:52.863
Give me your phone.

58:52.865 --> 58:54.231
Give me your phone.

58:54.233 --> 58:57.434
If I can fool the receptionist,
she can put me through.

58:57.436 --> 58:58.836
Is that her work?

58:58.838 --> 58:59.904
I'll try, okay?

59:18.224 --> 59:19.290
It's working.

59:24.530 --> 59:25.396
I will call later.

59:33.139 --> 59:34.472
She's not there.

59:35.108 --> 59:35.941
Not yet.

59:37.610 --> 59:39.277
Actually not at all.

59:42.481 --> 59:43.849
She left me.

59:44.516 --> 59:46.516
I'm not good enough for her.

59:46.518 --> 59:48.152
Oh well, maybe.

59:50.289 --> 59:51.389
You're not helping.

59:51.391 --> 59:52.657
You're not helping.

59:52.659 --> 59:53.492
Sorry.

01:00:22.989 --> 01:00:24.156
What's this?

01:00:26.527 --> 01:00:28.061
Give me that bar.

01:00:28.628 --> 01:00:29.528
Is that my shirt?

01:00:30.297 --> 01:00:31.496
Get out of my face.

01:00:31.498 --> 01:00:32.329
Go.

01:00:32.331 --> 01:00:33.898
Get out of my face.

01:00:43.576 --> 01:00:44.909
Where is it?

01:00:45.577 --> 01:00:46.878
Where is what?

01:00:47.514 --> 01:00:48.180
My phone.

01:00:49.349 --> 01:00:51.048
Well it's gone now.

01:00:52.184 --> 01:00:53.450
What do you mean
it's gone now?

01:00:53.452 --> 01:00:55.686
That was a gift from Tom.

01:00:55.688 --> 01:00:57.956
Well if it was a gift from
Tom then it's even better

01:00:57.958 --> 01:00:59.324
at the pawn shop then.

01:01:00.695 --> 01:01:01.961
Ah, ah, ah!

01:01:23.516 --> 01:01:24.349
Hey.

01:01:25.385 --> 01:01:26.385
Hi.

01:01:26.387 --> 01:01:27.452
How are you doing?

01:01:27.454 --> 01:01:28.253
Fine.

01:01:28.255 --> 01:01:29.420
Homemade for you.

01:01:29.422 --> 01:01:30.255
Organic?

01:01:33.226 --> 01:01:34.226
Of course.

01:01:35.496 --> 01:01:36.496
Here.

01:01:37.130 --> 01:01:37.596
Thank you.

01:01:38.166 --> 01:01:38.731
Is everything alright?

01:01:38.733 --> 01:01:40.600
Everything's perfect.

01:01:41.469 --> 01:01:44.003
I'm making now.

01:01:44.005 --> 01:01:45.471
Yeah I can tell.

01:01:46.106 --> 01:01:46.572
Really?

01:01:47.141 --> 01:01:47.941
Mm hmm.

01:01:48.510 --> 01:01:49.409
So see you tomorrow?

01:01:49.411 --> 01:01:50.242
Absolutely.

01:01:50.244 --> 01:01:51.144
Okay bye.

01:02:04.592 --> 01:02:05.590
I made it.

01:02:06.659 --> 01:02:07.492
Ah!

01:02:10.130 --> 01:02:10.963
I made it.

01:02:11.599 --> 01:02:12.432
Ah!

01:02:15.670 --> 01:02:17.604
What happened to her?

01:02:18.472 --> 01:02:19.539
I got the job interview.

01:02:19.541 --> 01:02:20.472
They wanna see me.

01:02:20.474 --> 01:02:21.673
I made it!

01:02:21.675 --> 01:02:22.608
Congrats.

01:02:22.610 --> 01:02:23.610
Thank you.

01:02:23.612 --> 01:02:24.778
You gonna start paying
for your own food now?

01:02:24.780 --> 01:02:27.179
Here I'm killing myself to
get you the best in the west

01:02:27.181 --> 01:02:29.415
and you do nothing but gaming.

01:02:30.418 --> 01:02:33.219
Oh, will you help me prepare?

01:02:34.255 --> 01:02:35.354
Please, please.

01:02:35.356 --> 01:02:36.523
Pretty please.

01:02:37.125 --> 01:02:38.525
Maybe I'm the best
coach in this city.

01:02:38.527 --> 01:02:39.526
I knew it.

01:02:40.596 --> 01:02:42.563
But if we're doing this,
we're doing it my way.

01:02:42.565 --> 01:02:43.365
Okay.

01:02:43.833 --> 01:02:44.664
Thank you.

01:02:44.666 --> 01:02:45.499
Thank you.

01:02:45.501 --> 01:02:46.501
Thank you.

01:02:49.371 --> 01:02:50.204
Ah!

01:02:52.275 --> 01:02:53.273
I'm so good.

01:02:53.543 --> 01:02:54.775
So good.

01:02:54.777 --> 01:02:56.242

01:02:56.244 --> 01:02:57.545

01:02:58.547 --> 01:02:59.479
Work well in teams.

01:02:59.481 --> 01:03:00.713
I work well in teams.

01:03:00.715 --> 01:03:01.749
- You're punctual.
- I'm punctual.

01:03:01.751 --> 01:03:02.849
- You're reliable.
- I'm reliable.

01:03:02.851 --> 01:03:04.117
You're enthusiastic.

01:03:04.119 --> 01:03:04.818
I can't anymore!

01:03:04.820 --> 01:03:06.220
You work well in teams.

01:03:06.222 --> 01:03:07.521
You're not working
hard, come on.

01:03:07.523 --> 01:03:08.789
Punctual, reliable.

01:03:08.791 --> 01:03:10.391
Enthusiastic, work
well in teams.

01:03:10.393 --> 01:03:11.624
Punctual, reliable.

01:03:11.626 --> 01:03:13.360
Enthusiastic, work
well in teams.

01:03:13.362 --> 01:03:14.394
Keep it going.

01:03:14.396 --> 01:03:15.229
You're punctual.

01:03:15.231 --> 01:03:16.028
I'm punctual.

01:03:16.030 --> 01:03:17.097
- You're reliable.
- I'm reliable.

01:03:17.099 --> 01:03:17.630
You're enthusiastic.

01:03:17.632 --> 01:03:18.264
I have cramps!

01:03:18.266 --> 01:03:19.532
You work well in teams!

01:03:19.534 --> 01:03:20.200
Well in teams.

01:03:20.202 --> 01:03:21.367
Come on, this is terrible.

01:03:21.369 --> 01:03:21.800
Come on.

01:03:21.802 --> 01:03:22.635
What?

01:03:22.637 --> 01:03:23.470
This is terrible.

01:03:23.472 --> 01:03:24.503
This sucks.

01:03:24.505 --> 01:03:25.838
Am I right?

01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:27.807
You're doing it right but
your legs are so skinny.

01:03:27.809 --> 01:03:28.809
Forgot about my legs!

01:03:28.811 --> 01:03:30.745
I have to get this job!

01:03:31.547 --> 01:03:32.345
He's right.

01:03:32.347 --> 01:03:33.715
Men love women's legs.

01:03:34.550 --> 01:03:36.117
What are you doing here?

01:03:36.518 --> 01:03:37.450
He's my stalker!

01:03:37.452 --> 01:03:39.519
Don't talk to him like that.

01:03:39.521 --> 01:03:40.787
He's the new owner.

01:03:40.789 --> 01:03:45.259
Oh well, it shows
how superior we are

01:03:45.695 --> 01:03:50.430
cause women, they don't care
about men's legs at all.

01:03:50.432 --> 01:03:52.666
Arnold, did you
notice the new equipment

01:03:52.668 --> 01:03:55.702
that I purchased over
there for the lower half?

01:03:57.306 --> 01:04:00.407
Are you suggesting that my
butt isn't good enough for you?

01:04:00.409 --> 01:04:02.775
I am merely suggesting to
Arnold that he make good use

01:04:02.777 --> 01:04:04.445
of the new equipment.

01:04:04.447 --> 01:04:08.450
Every time I see you I
would like to slap you!

01:04:12.255 --> 01:04:13.188
Ha, ha, ha.

01:04:13.456 --> 01:04:14.489
Okay?

01:04:15.925 --> 01:04:17.192
I'm reliable.

01:04:17.594 --> 01:04:18.527
You're what?

01:04:20.697 --> 01:04:21.829
I can work under pressure.

01:04:21.831 --> 01:04:23.164
- Yeah you can!
- I can!

01:04:23.166 --> 01:04:23.965
- You're reliable!
- I'm reliable!

01:04:23.967 --> 01:04:24.967
- You're punctual!

01:04:24.969 --> 01:04:26.434
- Work well in teams!
- I work well in teams!

01:04:26.436 --> 01:04:28.503
- You're reliable! - I'm reliable!
- You're punctual! - I'm punctual!

01:04:28.505 --> 01:04:30.338
- You work well in teams!
- I work well in teams!

01:04:30.340 --> 01:04:32.474
- You got this! - I got this!
- You're good! - I'm good!

01:04:32.476 --> 01:04:33.608
- You're punctual!
- I'm very good.

01:04:33.610 --> 01:04:34.809
You're reliable!

01:04:34.811 --> 01:04:35.911
She works well in teams!

01:04:35.913 --> 01:04:37.179
I work well in teams!

01:04:37.181 --> 01:04:37.811
You're enthusiastic!

01:04:37.813 --> 01:04:38.646
Yeah!

01:04:38.648 --> 01:04:40.213
- Come on!
- Come on!

01:04:40.215 --> 01:04:41.449
You got this!

01:04:41.451 --> 01:04:44.351
Punctual, reliable,
enthusiastic, work well in teams.

01:04:44.353 --> 01:04:45.885
Punctual.

01:04:45.887 --> 01:04:47.086
Punctual, reliable,
enthusiastic, work well in teams.

01:04:47.088 --> 01:04:51.492
Punctual, reliable,
enthusiastic, work well in teams.

01:04:51.494 --> 01:04:52.760
You're punctual!

01:04:52.762 --> 01:04:54.295
You're reliable!

01:04:54.297 --> 01:04:55.429
She works well in teams!

01:04:55.431 --> 01:04:56.396
You're so good.

01:04:56.398 --> 01:04:57.130
I think I'm ready.

01:04:57.132 --> 01:04:58.398
- You got this.
- I got this.

01:04:58.400 --> 01:04:59.400
- You're ready.
- Thank you.

01:04:59.402 --> 01:05:00.233
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

01:05:00.235 --> 01:05:00.667
Yeah.

01:05:24.494 --> 01:05:25.327
Yes!

01:05:30.467 --> 01:05:32.800
Somebody left
groceries like this!

01:05:32.802 --> 01:05:33.635
Again.

01:05:35.572 --> 01:05:40.409
Where is
buying all this stuff?

01:05:41.378 --> 01:05:42.577
Is it vegetarian?

01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:45.447
Looks amazing.

01:05:46.315 --> 01:05:47.514
Do you know what this is?

01:05:47.516 --> 01:05:49.851
It doesn't even
have a label on it.

01:05:49.853 --> 01:05:51.887
Oh, this one has a label.

01:05:54.023 --> 01:05:55.289
The cell is shut down.

01:05:55.291 --> 01:05:57.525
The agency calls us to Paris.

01:05:59.896 --> 01:06:01.398
Is this for you?

01:06:02.266 --> 01:06:03.299
Paris!

01:06:03.568 --> 01:06:04.367
No!

01:06:04.900 --> 01:06:05.733
No?

01:06:06.335 --> 01:06:06.968
No, no.

01:06:14.978 --> 01:06:15.809
No, no.

01:06:15.811 --> 01:06:16.744
Okay.

01:06:30.393 --> 01:06:31.226
Hi.

01:06:38.034 --> 01:06:39.268
Bye!

01:06:45.074 --> 01:06:46.574
Okay we can do it.

01:07:11.568 --> 01:07:13.402
15 January, perfect.

01:07:15.373 --> 01:07:16.371
I'm reliable.

01:07:16.373 --> 01:07:17.106
I'm punctual.

01:07:17.108 --> 01:07:18.740
I'm very professional.

01:07:18.742 --> 01:07:19.575
Sorry.

01:07:20.411 --> 01:07:21.043
Very professional.

01:07:22.079 --> 01:07:22.912
I'm reliable.

01:07:22.914 --> 01:07:23.746
I'm punctual.

01:07:24.581 --> 01:07:25.414
I'm very professional.

01:07:26.050 --> 01:07:27.083
Hello?

01:07:27.085 --> 01:07:28.650
I'm reliable.

01:07:28.652 --> 01:07:31.052
And I am a stupid, despaired
loser Britney Greenburg.

01:07:31.054 --> 01:07:32.119
Oh Britney.

01:07:32.121 --> 01:07:33.621
Mrs. Tanya Coba?

01:07:34.458 --> 01:07:35.090
Yes, here.

01:07:35.092 --> 01:07:36.458
Wait a minute.

01:07:38.829 --> 01:07:40.362
I have your kids.

01:07:40.364 --> 01:07:40.896
Listen.

01:07:41.365 --> 01:07:42.065
Mrs.!

01:07:42.867 --> 01:07:43.699
Yes, they're here.

01:07:43.701 --> 01:07:44.532
Mrs.!

01:07:44.534 --> 01:07:45.367
Yes.

01:07:45.369 --> 01:07:46.435
Well I can't.

01:07:47.038 --> 01:07:47.737
Yes, I'm coming.

01:07:49.373 --> 01:07:52.141
I can't talk right now but
can we meet at one o'clock

01:07:52.143 --> 01:07:53.909
in the breakfast place?

01:07:53.911 --> 01:07:54.744
Yes?

01:07:55.012 --> 01:07:55.878
Perfect!

01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:56.545
I'm so happy.

01:07:56.547 --> 01:07:57.313
Okay bye.

01:07:57.949 --> 01:07:58.780
I'm reliable.

01:07:58.782 --> 01:07:59.615
I'm punctual.

01:08:03.755 --> 01:08:04.586
Hello.

01:08:06.623 --> 01:08:07.623
Forget it.

01:08:08.159 --> 01:08:09.592
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:08:09.994 --> 01:08:11.025
Let's go.

01:08:11.027 --> 01:08:11.860
Let's go.

01:08:12.462 --> 01:08:13.062
Listen to me.

01:08:13.064 --> 01:08:14.397
No, you listen to me.

01:08:14.399 --> 01:08:15.130
I don't know you.

01:08:15.132 --> 01:08:16.531
I don't need your help.

01:08:16.533 --> 01:08:17.767
I don't need your pity.

01:08:17.769 --> 01:08:19.067
I don't need your nothing, okay?

01:08:19.069 --> 01:08:20.102
Bye.

01:08:20.104 --> 01:08:21.035
You need this job.

01:08:21.037 --> 01:08:22.571
No, I don't need this job.

01:08:22.573 --> 01:08:23.404
Okay?

01:08:24.108 --> 01:08:24.906
Your ruined my day.

01:08:24.908 --> 01:08:25.907
You ruined my dream.

01:08:25.908 --> 01:08:26.977
You have children.

01:08:26.979 --> 01:08:28.477
No, you've got it all wrong.

01:08:28.479 --> 01:08:29.112
Bye.

01:08:29.913 --> 01:08:31.046
Tanya, please.

01:08:32.417 --> 01:08:33.850
Take it and go.

01:08:34.118 --> 01:08:35.050
Go, go.

01:08:35.051 --> 01:08:36.051
Tanya, please, come on.

01:08:37.122 --> 01:08:37.988
Get it, go.

01:08:38.657 --> 01:08:39.122
Go.

01:09:36.113 --> 01:09:36.746
Ah!

01:09:38.117 --> 01:09:39.216
No, I wanna make things right.

01:09:39.219 --> 01:09:40.151
Okay?

01:09:40.153 --> 01:09:42.118
I can't live without you.

01:09:43.122 --> 01:09:44.122
I messed up.

01:09:45.692 --> 01:09:48.993
I wasn't putting you
first and I just hope

01:09:49.962 --> 01:09:51.529
you can forgive me.

01:09:52.765 --> 01:09:54.766
I don't know if I can.

01:09:57.002 --> 01:10:00.938
But after all, it is how
we repair our mistakes

01:10:02.542 --> 01:10:05.544
that define us in
each other's eyes.

01:10:08.215 --> 01:10:10.149
Will you re-marry me?

01:10:14.287 --> 01:10:15.120
I will.

01:10:17.024 --> 01:10:17.856
Yeah?

01:12:03.262 --> 01:12:04.095
Leave a message.

01:12:04.097 --> 01:12:05.630
Tanya Coba, thank you.

01:12:07.167 --> 01:12:08.701
Please, Tanya.

01:12:09.336 --> 01:12:11.270
I just wanna have a conversation

01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:15.141
where there's just peace
and quiet between us.

01:12:16.010 --> 01:12:17.909
Please, I'll send a car tonight.

01:12:18.979 --> 01:12:19.945
I just wanna talk to you.

01:12:40.868 --> 01:12:42.001
Who are you?

01:12:44.271 --> 01:12:45.072
Ah.

01:12:47.841 --> 01:12:48.841
I...

01:12:52.313 --> 01:12:53.947
Cleaning service.

01:12:54.815 --> 01:12:56.315
And who are you?

01:12:57.051 --> 01:12:58.684
Hi, cleaning services.

01:13:01.288 --> 01:13:02.855
Oh no you're not.

01:13:14.702 --> 01:13:18.170
So I fell for this
guy and he wasn't real.

01:13:19.739 --> 01:13:23.908
And then we came here and we
didn't have anywhere else to go

01:13:24.411 --> 01:13:25.911
and we didn't know
you were living here.

01:13:25.913 --> 01:13:26.947
I'm so sorry.

01:13:29.184 --> 01:13:30.851
So this is my story.

01:13:32.319 --> 01:13:34.053
That's quite a story.

01:13:34.055 --> 01:13:35.155
It really is.

01:13:36.291 --> 01:13:37.123
Igor.

01:13:37.926 --> 01:13:38.792
I'm sorry.

01:13:39.828 --> 01:13:41.494
It's alright, darling.

01:13:41.496 --> 01:13:43.795
Nothing could be worse
than flying in the backseat

01:13:43.797 --> 01:13:46.432
from Miami in an
economical class.

01:13:46.935 --> 01:13:47.801
Oh.

01:13:48.103 --> 01:13:48.835
Anyway.

01:13:50.838 --> 01:13:52.772
This Brian keeps calling
me and I'm exhausted.

01:13:52.774 --> 01:13:55.141
I don't know what to do anymore.

01:13:55.143 --> 01:13:59.779
Every time I feel this hope
it turns out to be wrong.

01:14:05.453 --> 01:14:07.454
I think my mom is right.

01:14:08.055 --> 01:14:09.088
I'm pathetic.

01:14:10.057 --> 01:14:13.425
Should go back home
to my parents' house.

01:14:13.427 --> 01:14:14.393
Don't do that.

01:14:14.395 --> 01:14:18.132
That sounds like the
worst idea in the world!

01:14:18.134 --> 01:14:20.933
Believe an old lady, darling.

01:14:20.935 --> 01:14:23.504
You know sometimes we make
mistakes in this life.

01:14:23.506 --> 01:14:26.272
But that shouldn't stop
us from living our lives,

01:14:26.274 --> 01:14:29.876
from being brave and following
our hopes and our dreams.

01:14:29.878 --> 01:14:30.510
So go!

01:14:30.512 --> 01:14:31.343
Go get ready!

01:14:31.345 --> 01:14:32.778
Follow this man.

01:14:32.780 --> 01:14:34.147
He sounds really
nice, doesn't he?

01:14:34.149 --> 01:14:36.316
So you think I should...

01:14:37.185 --> 01:14:38.018
Call him?

01:14:38.854 --> 01:14:40.018
I think you should
take a chance.

01:14:42.923 --> 01:14:44.891
If you don't take a chance,
you don't know what you'll

01:14:44.893 --> 01:14:46.460
have missed, so go.

01:14:47.362 --> 01:14:50.129
Go and get your nice
dress on and let's see you

01:14:50.131 --> 01:14:51.030
all partied up.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.967
Yes and you can finish
the dusting please.

01:14:55.904 --> 01:14:57.170
The place is a mess!

01:17:07.704 --> 01:17:10.539
Did Mr. Demari
move in recently?

01:17:10.541 --> 01:17:11.572
Yes, Madame.

01:17:11.574 --> 01:17:13.009
Well, no, Madame.

01:17:14.212 --> 01:17:18.714
Actually it's because the other
madame recently moved out.

01:17:18.716 --> 01:17:20.516
To the penthouse?

01:17:21.051 --> 01:17:22.383
Yes, I've heard
something like that.

01:17:22.385 --> 01:17:23.684
Yeah.

01:17:23.686 --> 01:17:26.353
Oh by the way, dinner
will be slightly delayed.

01:17:26.355 --> 01:17:30.658
We have new staff but they're
very highly recommended.

01:17:37.368 --> 01:17:38.201
Okay.

01:19:08.626 --> 01:19:09.458
Sorry.

01:19:10.394 --> 01:19:11.627
Absolutely beautiful.

01:19:13.396 --> 01:19:14.564
Just like you.

01:19:18.235 --> 01:19:20.437
Listen I asked you here...

01:19:20.439 --> 01:19:21.771
Brian, I have to
tell you something.

01:19:21.773 --> 01:19:23.406
No, just let me finish please.

01:19:23.408 --> 01:19:27.177
Otherwise I'll never get
the courage to tell you.

01:19:31.682 --> 01:19:35.218
From the moment that
I laid eyes on you,

01:19:35.220 --> 01:19:39.188
I knew that you were different,
that you were special.

01:19:39.190 --> 01:19:40.557
You mean awkward.

01:19:40.559 --> 01:19:45.561
Maybe a
little bit of that, too.

01:19:46.730 --> 01:19:48.498
But I couldn't stop
thinking about you

01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:51.502
and I can't stop
thinking about you.

01:19:55.573 --> 01:19:57.874
And yes, I am a successful man

01:19:57.876 --> 01:20:01.210
but success doesn't
necessarily mean happiness.

01:20:06.485 --> 01:20:10.387
Tanya, the feeling that
I have when I am with you

01:20:11.523 --> 01:20:14.425
makes me the happiest
man on the planet

01:20:15.393 --> 01:20:17.393
and I never, ever, ever
wanna stop feeling that.

01:20:22.533 --> 01:20:25.735
And I know that you have
children and a boyfriend.

01:20:27.338 --> 01:20:30.807
Well, there's been a
huge misunderstanding here.

01:20:31.676 --> 01:20:33.710
What sort of misunderstanding?

01:20:35.579 --> 01:20:38.481
You see, I don't
have children.

01:20:40.484 --> 01:20:42.852
And I don't have a boyfriend.

01:20:42.854 --> 01:20:43.820
You don't?

01:20:44.523 --> 01:20:45.287
No.

01:20:45.289 --> 01:20:46.090
Really?

01:20:46.390 --> 01:20:47.390
Yes.

01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:52.327
That really makes me the
happiest man on the planet.

01:20:52.329 --> 01:20:57.168
So it would be
okay if I did this?

01:21:03.643 --> 01:21:06.509
That would be really
absolutely okay.

01:21:06.511 --> 01:21:07.811
Let's do it again.

01:21:18.323 --> 01:21:19.456
I'm hungry.

01:21:19.859 --> 01:21:20.492
Hungry?

01:21:27.432 --> 01:21:29.366
I got new kitchen staff, so...

01:22:14.779 --> 01:22:15.612
Ah!

01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:22.285
