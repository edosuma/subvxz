01:05.230 --> 01:07.199
D'oh!

01:30.490 --> 01:33.789
I can't believe it!
We won another contest.

01:33.893 --> 01:38.262
- The Simpsons are going to Delaware!
- I wanna see Wilmington!

01:38.364 --> 01:41.094
- I wanna visit a screen door factory.
- Yep.

01:41.201 --> 01:43.863
Delaware's got it all.

01:43.970 --> 01:45.870
<i>You're next, Mr. Simpson.</i>

01:45.972 --> 01:49.430
- Hey, wait a minute. Airport tax: Five dollars?
- Sir, it's a standard fee.

01:49.542 --> 01:51.942
Well, we are not boarding that plane
unless you waive that tax.

01:53.046 --> 01:54.013
Waive it!

02:01.921 --> 02:03.821
Stupid anti-fist-shaking laws!

02:06.159 --> 02:08.821
The Simpsons are riding the rails!

02:08.928 --> 02:11.123
Cool. A dead hobo.

02:13.399 --> 02:15.663
Mornin', folks.

02:15.768 --> 02:18.532
- What are you gonna do to us?
- Now, don't worry.

02:18.638 --> 02:21.004
I'm not a stabbin' hobo.
I'm a singin' hobo.

02:21.107 --> 02:25.134
# Nothin' beats the hobo life #

02:25.245 --> 02:29.841
# Stabbin' folks with my hobo knife #

02:29.949 --> 02:32.315
- # I gouge them-##
- Excuse me, Hobo.

02:32.418 --> 02:35.046
Can you play something
a little less unnerving?

02:35.155 --> 02:37.316
Sure.

02:37.423 --> 02:40.119
I was just having a little fun
with you "nobos."

02:40.226 --> 02:43.662
Uh, here's a ballad that'll
set fire to your trash can.

02:46.266 --> 02:49.292
#Won't you listen to my tale
that's 10 stories tall #

02:49.402 --> 02:53.964
# 'Bout a king-sized woodsman
name a Bunyan, comma, Paul #

02:55.441 --> 02:58.569
<i>Congratulations, Mr. Bunyan.</i>

02:58.678 --> 03:01.146
It's a boy!

03:01.247 --> 03:03.442
Jeezum crow!

03:03.550 --> 03:06.849
- How was it, honey?
- Whiskey, please.

03:06.953 --> 03:09.478
Me "hungee."

03:12.625 --> 03:15.719
<i># Born mighty big</i>

03:15.828 --> 03:19.127

03:19.232 --> 03:21.132
Hey!

03:21.234 --> 03:24.032
I'll get ya!

03:27.373 --> 03:31.332
<i># His body grew big</i>
<i>but his brain stayed small #</i>

03:31.444 --> 03:37.246
<i># He was tree-choppin', friend-stompin'</i>

03:37.350 --> 03:39.250
Me hungee!

03:39.352 --> 03:42.253
<i>Time to make Paul's breakfast.</i>

03:43.723 --> 03:45.748
Hey, Paul, flapjacks!

03:49.729 --> 03:52.493
Flapjacks!

03:54.434 --> 03:57.301
Out of the frying pan!

03:58.705 --> 04:02.266
Yuck! All right, uh,
let's get started on lunch.

04:02.375 --> 04:06.243
- And-Wait. Where's Lenny?
- <i>Hello?</i>

04:06.346 --> 04:09.247
Can anybody hear me?

04:09.349 --> 04:11.249
I think I found a way out.

04:11.351 --> 04:13.945
It's not pretty, but it'll do.

04:17.156 --> 04:19.454
<i>All right, look, we gotta</i>
<i>do something about Bunyan.</i>

04:19.559 --> 04:21.754
We're going bankrupt
just feedin' and clothin' the guy...

04:21.861 --> 04:23.761
not to mention the crushings.

04:23.863 --> 04:28.664
Hey, I say we get him drunk
and drag him out of town.

04:28.768 --> 04:31.328
Same way we got rid of
Laura Ingalls Wilder.

04:31.437 --> 04:33.564
Yeah, that's a great idea!

04:33.673 --> 04:37.040
Hmm.

04:37.143 --> 04:39.543
Uh, hey, Paulie?

04:39.646 --> 04:42.410
What say we buy you a beer?

04:47.053 --> 04:50.853
Aw, you guys are the greatest friends
a giant doofus could have.

04:58.564 --> 05:01.032
Good Lord!
Brought down by one beer?

05:01.134 --> 05:03.534
And a couple of these babies.

05:03.636 --> 05:07.970
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm off to the barn dance.

05:09.208 --> 05:12.177
<i>Watch his head.</i>

05:15.381 --> 05:17.906
Where am I?

05:18.017 --> 05:20.485
Oh, they don't want me anymore.

05:24.891 --> 05:28.190
<i># Paul was just as lonely</i>
<i>as a man could get #</i>

05:28.294 --> 05:32.788
<i># So he took out his ax</i>
<i>and he carved himself a pet ##</i>

05:32.899 --> 05:34.890
And now-

05:35.001 --> 05:38.562
Oh, boy.
I wish you were real.

05:38.671 --> 05:42.107
Mmm.

05:50.550 --> 05:52.450
Hey, what the-

05:52.518 --> 05:54.486
Oh, it's a miracle!

05:54.587 --> 05:57.556
I'll call you Babe.
You'll be my best friend.

06:03.996 --> 06:05.964
<i>So Paul and his blue ox Babe...</i>

06:06.065 --> 06:10.001
<i>traveled all across this great land,</i>
<i>leavin'their mark.</i>

06:27.420 --> 06:30.981
<i>Excuse me. Paul Bunyan</i>
<i>never fought Rodan.</i>

06:31.090 --> 06:33.957
And his size seems to be
really inconsistent.

06:34.060 --> 06:36.358
I mean, one minute,
he's 10 feet tall.

06:36.462 --> 06:38.760
The next,
his feet are as big as a lake.

06:38.865 --> 06:42.266
- Hey, hey, hey! Who's the hobo here?
- I'm just sayin'.

06:45.471 --> 06:48.929
<i># Now Paul and Babe</i>
<i>were a mighty fine match #</i>

06:49.041 --> 06:53.944
- <i># But the man had an itch</i>
<i>that an ox couldn't scratch ##</i>
- Huh?

06:54.046 --> 06:58.107
<i>She's pretty.</i>

06:58.217 --> 07:01.448
Oh. What a handsome man.

07:15.601 --> 07:18.126
Got ya!

07:18.237 --> 07:21.798
Don't worry.
I won't smush you.

07:21.908 --> 07:25.674
- You're cute.
- Oh. Thank you.

07:25.778 --> 07:28.804
Hey, what are you doing?

07:28.915 --> 07:32.578
- I just wanna spruce up for our date.
- Oh.

07:32.685 --> 07:35.586
Whoo-hoo!

07:45.031 --> 07:46.931
Mmm!

07:54.941 --> 07:57.808
Oh!

07:59.879 --> 08:03.815
We've been together a long time now.

08:03.916 --> 08:07.682
- When are we gonna, you know-
- Soon.

08:07.787 --> 08:11.382
I just need a few more yoga classes.
Oh, look!

08:11.491 --> 08:13.516
A shooting star.

08:13.626 --> 08:17.289
<i>Hey, that meteor's</i>
<i>headed straight for us...</i>

08:17.396 --> 08:20.763
with the fire and the impact
and the 100% chance of pain!

08:20.867 --> 08:22.767
Pain in the glayvin!

08:22.869 --> 08:27.169
God has sent this fiery kill rock
to show us his love.

08:27.273 --> 08:30.504
No! We're gonna die!

08:30.610 --> 08:33.203
There's only one man
who can save us.

08:33.312 --> 08:35.212
Oh, I get it.

08:35.313 --> 08:37.544
When I'm crushing and killing you,
you don't like me.

08:37.650 --> 08:41.211
But when I can save your life,
suddenly I'm Mr. Popular.

08:41.320 --> 08:42.844
Yeah. That's pretty much it.

08:42.955 --> 08:44.855
Whoo-hoo!
I'm Mr. Popular!

08:53.132 --> 08:55.157
Come on.
Right across the plate.

08:55.268 --> 08:57.168
Let's see what you got, huh?

08:57.270 --> 09:00.831
This one's for the little crippled boy...
that I crippled.

09:00.940 --> 09:02.840
You can do it, Paul!

09:02.942 --> 09:05.604
Gimme a kiss for luck.

09:05.711 --> 09:07.440
Ow! Hot!

09:07.547 --> 09:09.947
Oh, boy, that's-

09:10.049 --> 09:12.483
Oh, come on!
Ow!

09:20.760 --> 09:25.720
<i>And that's how Paul Bunyan</i>
<i>started the great Chicago fire.</i>

09:25.831 --> 09:27.958
Boy, that story had everything.

09:28.067 --> 09:31.298
- A giant, house crushing, a meteor-
- Townspeople.

09:31.404 --> 09:33.304
Got any more tall tales?

09:33.406 --> 09:36.341
Well, I suppose I could
spin ya a few more yarns.

09:36.442 --> 09:40.742
But first, who wants to give
me a sponge bath? I'm filthy.

09:42.915 --> 09:44.815
All right.
But your next story...

09:44.917 --> 09:46.885
better be worth it.

09:49.322 --> 09:51.222
Get in there good.

09:51.324 --> 09:53.690
Yeah, that's it.
Don't be shy.

09:53.793 --> 09:55.818
There you go.

09:59.065 --> 10:01.659
<i>Okay. Ready for another impression?</i>

10:01.767 --> 10:05.294
This is SouthsideJake
tearing into Tin Can Tilly.

10:05.404 --> 10:07.304
Oh, this'll be good!

10:07.406 --> 10:10.603
"Who put the beans in my bindle?"

10:10.710 --> 10:14.612
"I am so tired of you saying
that I put beans in your bindle!

10:14.714 --> 10:16.614
It just makes me so"-

10:16.716 --> 10:18.707
"Do you ever shut up?"

10:18.818 --> 10:21.480
"Kiss me, you fool!"

10:25.591 --> 10:28.424
Uh, could we hear another tall tale?

10:28.527 --> 10:31.257
In a sec.

10:32.431 --> 10:34.331
<i>All righty.</i>

10:34.433 --> 10:37.129
Here's a story just for you, little girl.

10:37.236 --> 10:41.229
It's the tale ofJohnny-
No. Connie Appleseed.

10:41.340 --> 10:43.331
Oh.

10:44.810 --> 10:46.710
<i>Back around 1840...</i>

10:46.812 --> 10:49.303
<i>the great pie known as America...</i>

10:49.415 --> 10:51.883
<i>was still cooling</i>
<i>on the windowsill...</i>

10:51.984 --> 10:55.147
<i>and everybody headed west</i>
<i>for a slice.</i>

10:55.254 --> 10:59.054
# Cleaning my gun with the safety off
safety off, safety off #

10:59.158 --> 11:01.649
# Cleaning my gun with the-##

11:01.761 --> 11:03.592
Whoopsie.

11:03.696 --> 11:06.665
Dad, you just killed
a poor defenseless buffalo.

11:06.766 --> 11:08.893
A poor, delicious buffalo.

11:09.001 --> 11:13.199
He'll be dinner for the whole wagon train.

11:13.305 --> 11:15.671
- Why'd you kill another one?
- Dessert.

11:22.448 --> 11:23.881
Ow!

11:23.983 --> 11:25.917
Hey, I found a bullet.

11:28.688 --> 11:31.350
- Man, buffalo are easy to kill.
- <i>People...</i>

11:31.457 --> 11:34.654
if you don't stop this slaughter,
you'll wipe out the buffalo.

11:34.760 --> 11:38.355
Wipe out an entire species?
Why, that's impossible.

11:49.275 --> 11:53.177
Why is it we have ladders
that can put a man on the roof...

11:53.279 --> 11:56.077
but we can't find a
renewable source of food?

11:56.182 --> 11:58.548
Think, Connie. Think.

11:58.651 --> 12:00.983
- <i>Connie.</i>
- Wha-

12:01.087 --> 12:03.681
Connie.

12:03.789 --> 12:07.885
That tree! It seems to be calling to me.

12:11.797 --> 12:15.460
Of course! Apples!

12:15.568 --> 12:17.559
<i>No, Connie, over here!</i>

12:17.670 --> 12:20.230
Help me!

12:20.339 --> 12:23.137
Mom, Dad, look what I found!

12:23.242 --> 12:26.439
Oh, boy!
Buffalo testicles!

12:26.545 --> 12:30.606
- Mmm!
- No, Dad, they're apples.

12:30.716 --> 12:33.412
Yuck!

12:33.519 --> 12:37.888
Well, that's it. I don't want anything
to do with this wagon train of death.

12:37.990 --> 12:41.050
Either switch to apples,
or go on without me.

12:41.160 --> 12:43.287
Hmm!

12:45.364 --> 12:49.130
You'll be sorry!

12:51.237 --> 12:53.205
Oh!

12:54.640 --> 12:57.165
<i>So Connie roamed the prairie alone...</i>

12:57.276 --> 12:59.801
<i>planting apples seeds</i>
<i>all along the way.</i>

12:59.912 --> 13:03.575
<i>She even changed</i>
<i>her last name to Appleseed.</i>

13:03.682 --> 13:07.277
<i>And her family</i>
<i>changed theirs to Bufflekill.</i>

13:20.766 --> 13:23.826
I haven't had buffalo in six hours.
Marge...

13:23.936 --> 13:26.234
how about whipping up
some buffalo sausage...

13:26.338 --> 13:29.705
huevos buffaleros,
and some fresh-squeezed buffal-O. J?

13:29.809 --> 13:33.609
The buffalo are gone.
I think you shot them all.

13:35.681 --> 13:38.548
Oh! Connie was right!

13:38.651 --> 13:41.484
We wiped out the entire species!

13:41.587 --> 13:45.387
What have I done?
What have I done?

13:45.491 --> 13:49.291
Calm down, Pa.
There's two left.

13:52.398 --> 13:56.926
What have I done?
What have I done?

13:57.036 --> 14:00.904
<i>With the buffalo gone, the starving</i>
<i>settlers were driven to cannibalism.</i>

14:02.508 --> 14:04.976
You're the fattest, Bufflekill.

14:05.077 --> 14:07.170
Okay, everybody, dig in!

14:10.149 --> 14:12.049
<i>Stop! I've got apples!</i>

14:12.151 --> 14:14.176
Delicious, nutritious apples.

14:14.286 --> 14:16.481
And there's enough for everyone.

14:21.126 --> 14:23.060
Sweet!

14:23.162 --> 14:25.392
It's like a hootenanny in my mouth!

14:25.497 --> 14:27.556
- We're saved!
- It's a miracle!

14:27.666 --> 14:30.635
- Hooray for Connie Bufflekill!
- What?

14:30.736 --> 14:33.261
So now we're not eating Homer?

14:34.773 --> 14:36.934
And thanks to that little girl...

14:37.042 --> 14:40.170
today you can find apples
in everything that's good.

14:40.279 --> 14:42.474
Apple wine, apple whiskey...

14:42.581 --> 14:45.243
apple schnapps, apple martinis...

14:45.351 --> 14:47.717
uh, Snapple with vodka in it...

14:47.820 --> 14:49.811
apple nail polish remover-

14:49.922 --> 14:51.787
Don't forget applesauce.

14:51.891 --> 14:56.260
Yeah. I suppose you could
grind some pills into it.

14:56.362 --> 14:58.227
Aw.

15:02.568 --> 15:06.937
- Look out there, folks. That's the mighty Mississip.
- Big deal.

15:07.039 --> 15:10.440
Reminds me of a tall tale
about two scalawags...

15:10.542 --> 15:13.136
rafting down the Big Muddy-

15:13.245 --> 15:15.679
Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn.

15:15.781 --> 15:18.978
That's not a tall tale.
It's a book by Mark Twain.

15:19.084 --> 15:21.917
Look, let's just do this thing.

15:25.524 --> 15:28.618
Whitewashing sucks, Tom.
It powerful sucks.

15:28.727 --> 15:30.627
Morning, friend.

15:30.729 --> 15:33.698
Want your turn at whitewashin'?
It's powerful fun.

15:33.799 --> 15:36.927
Why, you ain't fooling me again,
Tom Sawyer.

15:37.036 --> 15:39.163
If I may.

15:39.271 --> 15:41.171
Now get to work!

15:44.410 --> 15:46.503
I still got it.

15:48.614 --> 15:51.777
Now, Huckleberry Finn,
you get down from there.

15:51.884 --> 15:54.079
A body could break his neck.

15:54.186 --> 15:56.086
I ain't afeard of that.

15:56.188 --> 15:58.952
I'd just get a new neck off n a cat.

15:59.058 --> 16:01.356
Huck!

16:01.460 --> 16:05.021
Oh, Huck, you gave your bones
an awful rattling.

16:05.130 --> 16:09.863
Yeah. But I'm feeling
better right now.

16:11.270 --> 16:13.295
- <i>Aha!</i>
- Papa!

16:13.405 --> 16:15.566
Hold my daughter's hand, will ya?

16:15.674 --> 16:18.871
I was gonna let go by-and-by.

16:18.978 --> 16:23.210
Well, I guess there's no harm done
as long as it was gonna be by-and-by.

16:23.315 --> 16:25.215
But just to play it safe-

16:25.317 --> 16:28.582
We're gathered here today to force this man...

16:28.687 --> 16:32.350
Huckleberry Finn,
into holy matrimony.

16:32.458 --> 16:35.086
How romantic.

16:35.194 --> 16:38.061
This reminds me
of our shotgun wedding.

16:38.163 --> 16:40.097
Grandpa, we've been
married for years.

16:40.199 --> 16:42.099
When are you gonna
put down that gun?

16:42.201 --> 16:45.932
Well, I reckon you're right.
Hang it all!

16:46.038 --> 16:49.838
Do you, Huck,
take Becky as your wife?

16:49.942 --> 16:52.308
Whoa!

16:52.411 --> 16:56.279
Hey, they done switched
the groom with a pig!

16:56.382 --> 16:59.510
- No wonder he was pooping so much.
- <i>Ha-ha!</i>

17:02.087 --> 17:04.646
Come on!
Let's get those polecats!

17:10.863 --> 17:14.094
Oh! Now we'll never catch 'em!

17:16.502 --> 17:20.097
I reckon we're safe now.
There's the state line.

17:25.377 --> 17:27.538
Uh-oh!
Rapids!

17:31.750 --> 17:34.810
<i>Please do not exit the raft...</i>

17:34.920 --> 17:37.821
<i>until it has come</i>
<i>to a complete stop.</i>

17:37.923 --> 17:40.585
Mr. Silas, this young lady's
flashing her privates.

17:40.692 --> 17:44.560
<i>Oh! Well, I'll dispose of this!</i>

17:44.663 --> 17:47.530
All for Silas. All for Silas.

17:53.772 --> 17:56.366
I'm considerable hungry.
We got any food left?

17:56.475 --> 17:58.409
Hmm. Looks like
we're out of corn pone...

17:58.510 --> 18:01.343
fatback, hardtack,
fat pone, "corntack."

18:01.447 --> 18:03.108
- Any "tackback"?
- "Tackback"?

18:03.215 --> 18:04.944
- I mean "backtack."
- Plumb out.

18:08.554 --> 18:11.523
One jug of whiskey,
three plugs of"tobacky"...

18:11.623 --> 18:13.750
and some extra-strength opium.

18:13.859 --> 18:16.953
- That will be two cents, boys.
- Two cents?

18:17.062 --> 18:20.725
Hey, if you think my prices are high,
go across the street.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.800
<i>Thank you. Come again.</i>

18:24.903 --> 18:28.600
- He put the lard pone on top of the egg pone.
- Dang!

18:31.110 --> 18:32.577
Double dang!

18:35.080 --> 18:37.378
Aw, donkey butter!

18:43.322 --> 18:46.553
Oh, it's no use.

18:46.658 --> 18:49.252
I got an idea.

18:50.829 --> 18:53.024
Uh- Hmm.

18:53.132 --> 18:56.465
Well, dog my cats.
They's dis-apporated.

18:58.537 --> 19:03.031
Keep quiet, Huck. They won't look up here
if nothing draws their attention.

19:03.142 --> 19:05.770
# Old man river #

19:05.878 --> 19:10.076
<i># That old man river#</i>

19:10.182 --> 19:14.983
# He just keeps rolling #

19:18.690 --> 19:22.251
Well, I see President Fillmore
is in the news again.

19:22.361 --> 19:24.852
Glug, glug, glug.

19:25.764 --> 19:28.460
What'll it be, boys?

19:28.567 --> 19:30.865
- Just three X's for me.
- Give me five.

19:37.476 --> 19:40.502
This ain't no five-X whiskey.
I can still see.

19:40.612 --> 19:42.512
That barkeep's a no-good cheat!

19:42.614 --> 19:45.014
Cheat?

19:48.887 --> 19:53.017
<i>Eh-All right.</i>
<i>We've all got derringers.</i>

19:53.125 --> 19:56.424
Now let's just put 'em away.
Nobody here is a cheat.

19:56.528 --> 19:59.361
- Cheat?
- Aw, geez.

20:02.935 --> 20:06.530
Man, those derringer bullets
are weak.

20:06.638 --> 20:08.663
Powerful weak.

20:08.774 --> 20:10.867
Light out, and stay lit out!

20:16.081 --> 20:17.981
Aw, catfish.

20:18.083 --> 20:22.577
<i>Let us pray for the souls of these</i>
<i>dearly departed young men...</i>

20:22.688 --> 20:27.387
Huckleberry Finn and Thomas Sawyer.

20:30.095 --> 20:34.122
Now for the traditional lowering
of the bodies into the coffins.

20:40.639 --> 20:43.403
And that was Tom and Huck's
last adventure.

20:43.508 --> 20:46.534
I liked that story,
'cause I was a judge.

20:46.645 --> 20:48.203
Delaware!

20:48.313 --> 20:52.773
Well, this is our stop. Would you
like to come sightseeing with us?

20:52.884 --> 20:56.786
We're gonna visit the place where
JCPenney sends their damaged merchandise.

20:56.888 --> 21:00.483
No, thanks.
I'm gonna keep on ridin' the rails...

21:00.592 --> 21:02.423
swappin' stories for sponge baths.

21:06.498 --> 21:09.592
I believe I told <i>three</i> stories.

21:10.902 --> 21:14.030
Oh!
I'll meet you in Wilmington.

21:16.508 --> 21:18.635
Close the door.

21:20.579 --> 21:24.310
<i>Raise your arm. Okay, the other one.</i>

21:24.416 --> 21:27.510
<i>You know, I do, uh, 400 sit-ups a day.</i>

21:27.619 --> 21:29.519
<i>Oh, it shows.</i>
<i>I was gonna say something...</i>

21:29.621 --> 21:32.784
- <i>but I thought it might sound, you know, weird.</i>
- <i>Oh, not at all.</i>

21:32.891 --> 21:35.724
<i>I like when people</i>
<i>say nice things about my body.</i>

21:35.827 --> 21:38.091
<i>And it's important</i>
<i>to feel good about yourself.</i>

21:38.196 --> 21:39.264
<i>Okay, spread your toes.</i>
<i>Oh!</i>

21:39.264 --> 21:41.494
<i>Okay, spread your toes.</i>
<i>Oh!</i>

21:41.600 --> 21:44.501
<i>You know how much glass is in here?</i>

22:24.676 --> 22:26.234
Shh!

22:26.345 --> 22:29.508
<i>Oh, boy! Buffalo testicles!</i>

22:30.305 --> 22:36.659
