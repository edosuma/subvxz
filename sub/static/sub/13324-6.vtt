WEBVTT

00:02.211 --> 00:04.170
Okay. Who would like to start today?

00:04.254 --> 00:06.130
l would.

00:06.215 --> 00:08.549
What's with the attitude?

00:08.717 --> 00:10.218
lt's a splint.

00:10.302 --> 00:12.470
l broke my finger last night because of you.

00:12.554 --> 00:14.514
See, everybody?

00:15.766 --> 00:17.684
And how exactly was l involved in that?

00:17.768 --> 00:19.143
You didn't answer your phone.

00:19.228 --> 00:21.354
l was in line at a club when some
dog-faced bitch

00:21.438 --> 00:24.315
shoved me and l tripped and fell
on the ground.

00:24.400 --> 00:26.526
-And that's how you broke your finger?
-No.

00:26.610 --> 00:30.571
l was angry, so l called Charlie
to talk me down, but you didn't pick up.

00:30.656 --> 00:33.908
So l found said bitch, took her face,
shoved it into the turntables,

00:33.992 --> 00:36.911
got my finger caught in her
cheap-ass weave, and it broke.

00:38.497 --> 00:41.999
First of all, said therapist takes no
responsibility for said bitch slam.

00:43.377 --> 00:46.295
But, Lacey, if you had gotten a hold of me,
what would l have said?

00:46.380 --> 00:49.173
You would have said for me to use my
communication skills,

00:49.258 --> 00:53.052
express my hurt, breathe deeply,
and walk away.

00:53.137 --> 00:54.137
So, why didn't you do that?

00:54.221 --> 00:56.848
l couldn't get in touch with you.

00:56.932 --> 00:58.266
Okay, let's solve this problem.

00:58.350 --> 01:00.768
Well, if we took some of that tape
around her wrist

01:00.853 --> 01:03.521
and put it over her mouth,
l think that would solve it.

01:06.817 --> 01:09.610
Look. You all know the basic techniques
of anger management.

01:09.695 --> 01:11.070
Now, in the event that you can't get
through to me,

01:11.155 --> 01:13.030
there's no reason you can't contact
each other.

01:13.115 --> 01:15.241
We'll call it the anger buddy call system.

01:15.325 --> 01:17.744
This is actually a really good idea.

01:17.828 --> 01:21.080
-Ed, you'll call Patrick.
-Oh, crap.

01:21.165 --> 01:23.458
Patrick, you'll call Nolan. And Nolan...

01:23.542 --> 01:27.170
-Ed calls me, l call Patrick.
-Oh, crap.

01:27.254 --> 01:29.797
Nolan, you'll call Lacey, and Lacey,
you call Ed.

01:32.468 --> 01:33.843
-Hello?
-Hi.

01:35.345 --> 01:37.638
Guys, l don't think you're getting the idea.

01:37.723 --> 01:39.265
Nolan, if you
call Lacey again, you better be...

01:39.349 --> 01:41.100
On fire.

01:41.185 --> 01:42.351
With rage and about to...

01:42.436 --> 01:44.228
Stab yourself in the face.

01:44.313 --> 01:45.855
Lacey, sometimes l worry that you're...

01:45.939 --> 01:48.941
Too bitter to ever find a good guy
to love me?

01:49.026 --> 01:52.403
That l'm going to end up living in some
'90s stucco condo

01:52.488 --> 01:55.406
in Burbank with some loser?

01:55.491 --> 01:56.991
Like Nolan!

02:07.628 --> 02:10.046
Hey, Charlie.

02:14.176 --> 02:15.551
Hi, Kate.

02:15.636 --> 02:18.304
Don't worry about it, Charlie.
This is my friend, Victor.

02:18.388 --> 02:19.764
-Nice to meet you.
-Pleasure.

02:19.848 --> 02:22.892
Victor and l met at a silent auction for
the Museum of Contemporary Arts.

02:22.976 --> 02:26.604
We got into a little bidding war
over one ofAndy Warhol's wigs.

02:26.688 --> 02:28.564
We were outbid by the Sultan of Brunei.

02:28.649 --> 02:30.942
Barely.

02:31.026 --> 02:34.612
l feel you. l can't tell you how many
wigs l've lost to that guy.

02:34.696 --> 02:36.155
What a dick.

02:37.658 --> 02:39.951
Okay, well, l'll see you tonight.

02:43.956 --> 02:46.374
Excuse me, but don't you and l have a
little playdate tonight?

02:46.458 --> 02:49.877
Yeah.
Victor and l are going to engage in some

02:49.962 --> 02:52.421
pseudointellectual one-upmanship
over dinner,

02:52.506 --> 02:56.425
then the symphony, and then l'm coming
over to your place to bang.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.135
So, how are you feeling today?

02:58.220 --> 03:00.638
Stupid, but bangable.

03:00.722 --> 03:02.139
Come on. You're not jealous.

03:02.224 --> 03:07.770
Of Grandpa Victor? No, l'm sure his
tales of the Old West are spellbinding.

03:08.647 --> 03:11.399
He just has a brilliant intellect
and l find him fascinating.

03:11.483 --> 03:12.650
So, do you guys ever go out during the day

03:12.734 --> 03:15.361
or does the sunlight
make him burst into flames?

03:15.821 --> 03:17.029
Charlie, l can't believe you're this upset.

03:17.114 --> 03:18.114
You barely met the guy.

03:18.198 --> 03:21.742
But you saw how he was.
"The Sultan of Brunei stole my wig."

03:23.370 --> 03:26.497
Look, just because l like someone smart
doesn't mean you're dumb.

03:26.582 --> 03:30.042
You are the smartest
ex-baseball player l know.

03:30.127 --> 03:33.170
Victor's just been a cultured
intellectual all his life.

03:33.255 --> 03:35.172
You're nouveau smart.

03:35.257 --> 03:37.008
l've been smart my whole life.

03:37.092 --> 03:40.344
l just happened to be a good-looking athlete
that didn't need to use it to get girls.

03:41.096 --> 03:43.848
But l've always had that bullet
in the chamber.

03:43.932 --> 03:47.143
Just waiting for my looks to fade.

03:47.227 --> 03:48.728
l'm still waiting.

03:49.980 --> 03:52.064
Charlie, double-shot latte.

03:53.901 --> 03:57.778
l'm sorry, Allie, but l ordered a
double-shot espresso.

03:57.863 --> 03:58.863
Would you mind drinking this anyway?

03:58.947 --> 04:00.907
'Cause if you return it,
then l got to pay for it.

04:00.991 --> 04:03.701
l'll tell you what.
l'll bet that in the next five minutes

04:03.785 --> 04:07.038
someone will want a double-shot latte,
and if not, l'll pay for it.

04:07.122 --> 04:09.498
Statistically, considering the number of
drinks that we offer,

04:09.583 --> 04:11.042
the foot traffic this time of day,

04:11.126 --> 04:13.502
and the relative
popularity of a double-shot latte,

04:13.587 --> 04:15.880
you're looking at odds of 20-1 .

04:15.964 --> 04:18.341
Wow. lmpressive.
Where did that come from?

04:18.425 --> 04:21.218
l'm working on my PhD in applied
statistical economics.

04:21.303 --> 04:23.262
And you just used it in your real life?

04:23.347 --> 04:26.057
You might be the first person
to ever do that.

04:26.141 --> 04:29.352
-But l think your odds are way off.
-You want to bet?

04:29.436 --> 04:32.063
Okay, but l'm legally bound to warn you
that l'm a psychotherapist

04:32.147 --> 04:35.483
and l know the power of subliminal
priming and cognitive influence.

04:35.567 --> 04:36.692
lmpressive.

04:36.777 --> 04:40.988
And l guarantee that someone will order
one of these in the next five minutes.

04:41.073 --> 04:44.575
You're on. Okay, clock starts right now.

04:44.660 --> 04:49.246
Hello. l'd like a double-shot latte, please.

04:49.331 --> 04:51.707
lf you have one at room temperature,
that'd be great.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.501
-Well played.
-Thank you.

04:53.585 --> 04:55.211
Too bad we didn't decide on a wager.

04:55.295 --> 04:58.214
Well, we're both so smart, l just assumed
we were talking about a dinner date.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.548
How do l know you're my type?

04:59.633 --> 05:03.594
Maybe you can gather some empirical
evidence by going out to dinner with me.

05:03.679 --> 05:08.015
Okay. l'd love to. But only because you
used the word empirical properly.

05:09.017 --> 05:12.520
Thank God.
l was gripping the wheel on that one.

05:19.194 --> 05:21.237
Wow. You are on fire tonight.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.114
lt's that opera Victor took me to.

05:23.198 --> 05:24.865
You wouldn't think a woman
who kills her husband

05:24.950 --> 05:28.077
in the bridal chamber
would be such a turn-on.

05:28.161 --> 05:30.955
You know, l've been looking for a good
husband-murdery opera to go to,

05:31.039 --> 05:33.165
and this sounds like the one.

05:33.250 --> 05:35.126
You're going to an opera?

05:35.210 --> 05:38.421
-l made a new friend.
-A new friend?

05:39.047 --> 05:40.965
We've gone out a couple of times.

05:41.049 --> 05:43.300
Saturday, we're celebrating that she
finished her dissertation,

05:43.385 --> 05:44.885
so we're going to go to the opera.

05:44.970 --> 05:47.805
Opera? Dissertation? Does she know you're
only going out with her

05:47.889 --> 05:50.307
to get back at me for Victor?

05:50.392 --> 05:53.811
She's extremely smart, she'll figure it out.

05:53.895 --> 05:56.522
That's only part of the reason l'm doing it.

05:56.606 --> 06:00.359
She's the smartest woman l've ever met
and she finds me fascinating.

06:00.444 --> 06:02.319
We have a meeting of the minds.

06:02.404 --> 06:06.949
ls this meeting at the corner of
wishful and thinking?

06:07.034 --> 06:10.536
Well, actually, it's in your building.
She works in the coffee shop.

06:11.163 --> 06:12.580
Wait.

06:13.248 --> 06:15.082
You're not talking about Allie, are you?

06:15.167 --> 06:16.542
You know her?

06:16.626 --> 06:21.005
Yes. She's a patient of mine.
l don't think you should be seeing her.

06:21.089 --> 06:22.339
Come on. Why?

06:22.424 --> 06:24.175
Because it's a huge conflict for me.

06:24.259 --> 06:26.135
You're dating her now,
you're gonna be sleeping with her,

06:26.219 --> 06:29.096
and l need to be objective about
your relationships when l analyze you.

06:29.181 --> 06:32.683
Now pull my underwear down with
your teeth.

06:33.518 --> 06:34.977
No problem.
l'll just go out with her as a friend,

06:35.062 --> 06:36.937
just like you do with the guys that you see.

06:37.022 --> 06:39.690
Yes, but you can't just have women friends.

06:39.775 --> 06:41.525
Sex is your Achilles' heel.

06:41.610 --> 06:43.569
The longest you've ever resisted a
vagina is now

06:43.653 --> 06:46.447
and it's starting to get me upset.

06:48.158 --> 06:50.367
All right. l don't like it, but fine.

06:50.452 --> 06:53.079
l'll explain to her
that l can't see her anymore.

06:53.163 --> 06:55.623
Thank you for respecting my wishes.

06:55.707 --> 06:58.459
Okay. Underwear, teeth, now.

06:59.795 --> 07:02.046
Aren't you forgetting something?

07:02.130 --> 07:03.923
Please?

07:09.471 --> 07:10.805
What the hell?

07:13.892 --> 07:14.892
Hello?

07:14.976 --> 07:18.395
Ed, it's Patrick. From group.

07:18.480 --> 07:21.232
What are you calling me for?
lt's the middle of the night.

07:21.316 --> 07:23.609
lt's 9:30.

07:23.693 --> 07:28.864
l get up at 4:00. That's when l piss, shave,
and have breakfast.

07:28.949 --> 07:33.953
That's three things l accomplish
before you get your first peter in your face.

07:34.037 --> 07:37.164
Can you come over, please?
l'm about to lose it with my neighbors.

07:37.249 --> 07:41.043
They've been having a party for the
last 1 2 hours and it's driving me crazy.

07:41.128 --> 07:42.128
Call the cops.

07:42.212 --> 07:43.879
l did and they won't do anything.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.214
You're my anger buddy call.

07:45.298 --> 07:48.676
Could you please come over
here and talk me down?

07:48.760 --> 07:51.679
lf l come over there,
somebody's gonna get hurt.

07:51.763 --> 07:53.764
l don't want you to beat them up.

07:53.849 --> 07:56.475
l'm talking about you.

07:57.269 --> 07:59.728
Look at me, dude. You want me in there.

08:03.066 --> 08:04.650
What's up, Patrick? What do you want?

08:04.734 --> 08:07.278
l am about to lose it with my neighbors.

08:07.362 --> 08:10.573
-l called Ed, but he blew me off.
-What are they doing?

08:10.657 --> 08:14.243
They're having a party with really loud
music that has been going on forever.

08:14.327 --> 08:15.953
Listen.

08:16.037 --> 08:19.540
Sounds like the DJ is playing Skrillex.
Cool, l'll be right over.

08:27.757 --> 08:29.425
Nolan residence.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.802
Nolan, l need a ride to Patrick's, now.

08:31.887 --> 08:34.221
And l'm supposed to just stop
whatever l'm doing?

08:35.140 --> 08:36.473
Yes.

08:37.100 --> 08:38.684
Okay.

08:39.394 --> 08:41.520
-l'm at the Abbey.
-Yeah, you are.

08:45.025 --> 08:47.067
Charlie, sorry l'm late.

08:47.152 --> 08:49.820
lt took me a while
to print out my dissertation.

08:49.905 --> 08:51.864
For you.

08:51.948 --> 08:54.825
-Thank you. l'm flattered.
-Yeah.

08:54.910 --> 08:57.411
"Statistical deviations in the estimated
gross domestic product

08:57.495 --> 09:00.998
"of the Soviet Bloc, 1 971 -1 972
as compared to the..."

09:01.666 --> 09:04.543
You know what,
l'll read the rest of the title tonight.

09:04.628 --> 09:07.504
Okay, it may be a little dry for
somebody who's not into statistics.

09:07.589 --> 09:10.925
Even for the casual statistics lover.

09:11.009 --> 09:14.511
You might want to think about ending the
title with Beyond Thunderdome.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.388
l'm sorry, l don't know what that means.

09:16.473 --> 09:19.141
Really? Mad Max? lt's a movie.

09:19.226 --> 09:21.477
lt doesn't matter.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.979
Allie, l can't go out with you anymore.

09:24.064 --> 09:27.566
Okay, it's only like two hours of my life.
l'll watch the movie.

09:28.443 --> 09:32.029
No, no, it's not that.
Kate Wales is my best friend

09:32.113 --> 09:35.407
and we're both her patients
and she doesn't want us to do this.

09:35.492 --> 09:37.701
-Really?
-Yeah, she felt pretty strongly about it.

09:37.786 --> 09:39.870
There's no wiggle room here. lt's forbidden.

09:39.955 --> 09:42.206
Forbidden, huh?

09:42.290 --> 09:43.374
Well, l mean, that just seems so silly.

09:43.458 --> 09:45.542
We're just friends. What do we have to hide?

09:45.627 --> 09:47.336
l know, l know. l agree with you.

09:47.420 --> 09:48.379
l just don't want to upset her.

09:48.463 --> 09:51.966
-l mean, it's not like we're doing this.
-Doing...

09:53.468 --> 09:57.721
l mean, if Kate saw that,
she would be pretty upset, right?

09:57.806 --> 10:01.308
lf the vice squad saw that,
they'd be pretty upset.

10:01.393 --> 10:04.895
-Zipper, not buttons.
-You're bad.

10:05.522 --> 10:07.064
l wonder what Kate would say if she

10:07.148 --> 10:10.317
walked in on us in the bathroom
in the next 1 5 minutes?

10:10.402 --> 10:12.194
She'd probably say,
"l can't believe you're doing this

10:12.279 --> 10:14.488
"and l'm deeply disappointed
in both of you."

10:15.282 --> 10:17.408
But there's only one way to find out.

10:21.663 --> 10:23.372
Sam, l promised my friend l would read her

10:23.456 --> 10:25.582
dissertation and l'm seeing her tonight.
Are you done yet?

10:25.667 --> 10:26.875
You got my 1 0 bucks?

10:26.960 --> 10:30.170
Not so fast. The deal was you write me a
one-page synopsis of it

10:30.255 --> 10:32.464
so l know what l'm talking about,
and then you get the money.

10:37.345 --> 10:38.887
Thank you.

10:40.015 --> 10:42.599
"This is a very interesting dissertation
with multiple themes

10:42.684 --> 10:47.354
"that l have found to be very interesting.

10:51.651 --> 10:54.486
Hey, all you did was copy the title!

10:54.571 --> 10:56.613
Hey, all you did was give me 1 0 bucks.

11:02.829 --> 11:05.289
Hey, hey, hey.
Don't eat that. lt's for the group.

11:05.373 --> 11:08.375
-Sorry.
-Well, don't put it back. You touched it.

11:08.460 --> 11:09.460
l'll toss it.

11:09.544 --> 11:11.086
Don't throw it away. lt's perfectly good food.

11:11.171 --> 11:14.006
What am l supposed to do with this?

11:14.090 --> 11:16.550
Well, you might as well eat it now.

11:16.634 --> 11:20.012
-Hey, not so fast! You wanna taste it.
-What is wrong with you?

11:20.096 --> 11:23.182
l'm sorry, Mike. l'm on edge.

11:23.266 --> 11:25.559
l did something that l shouldn't have done.

11:25.643 --> 11:27.978
Touched a muffin you weren't supposed to?

11:28.063 --> 11:29.730
Well, in a way.

11:32.150 --> 11:34.276
l had sex with one of Kate's patients
last night.

11:34.361 --> 11:35.486
Why is that a problem?

11:35.570 --> 11:37.237
She told me not to, l agreed not to,

11:37.322 --> 11:39.406
and now l want to do it again.

11:39.491 --> 11:44.453
Well, Kate better not find out.
Hell hath no fury like a woman's corn.

11:45.622 --> 11:47.706
Mike, it's Shakespeare.

11:47.791 --> 11:50.209
"Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned."

11:50.293 --> 11:51.960
Yeah, trust me, Charles.
A woman doesn't throw a can

11:52.045 --> 11:55.547
of scorned at your head
after you've had sex with her sister.

11:56.132 --> 11:58.926
l stand corrected.
ls that why you got divorced?

11:59.010 --> 12:00.803
No, no, no. Political differences.

12:00.887 --> 12:03.514
Yes, that's why l got divorced.

12:03.598 --> 12:05.391
l betrayed her trust.

12:05.475 --> 12:08.769
Well, that's what's so weird. Kate and l
have no emotional obligation to each other,

12:08.853 --> 12:10.521
but l still feel like l'm cheating on her.

12:10.605 --> 12:11.688
Stop seeing the girl.

12:11.773 --> 12:16.735
l don't want to. She's smart,
she's attractive, she thinks l'm intelligent,

12:16.820 --> 12:19.196
and she's into all this crazy, dangerous sex.

12:19.280 --> 12:23.367
You can barely drive the woman home
without risking your life.

12:23.451 --> 12:25.619
lt's awesome.

12:28.373 --> 12:30.624
Problem is, Kate's our therapist.

12:30.708 --> 12:34.169
Wait, don't you have great sex
with Kate, too?

12:34.254 --> 12:35.379
Yes.

12:35.463 --> 12:41.051
So, let me get this straight. You have
two women that you have great sex with,

12:41.136 --> 12:44.096
and l haven't been laid since
the niblet incident.

12:44.848 --> 12:48.225
l got nothing and you're hassling me
about a danish?

12:48.309 --> 12:50.477
Shame on you!

12:53.314 --> 12:55.649
You were supposed to talk me out of it!

13:01.114 --> 13:02.114
Hey, guys.

13:02.198 --> 13:06.452
You owe me $750 for
bailing these morons out ofjail.

13:07.996 --> 13:11.540
Jail?
Anyone want to tell me what happened?

13:11.624 --> 13:14.501
Moe? Larry? Curly?

13:14.586 --> 13:16.211
My neighbors were having a really
loud party,

13:16.296 --> 13:21.258
so l used your anger buddy thing
and called Lacey and Nolan,

13:21.342 --> 13:25.804
and they came over to try to calm me
down, and then things got crazy.

13:25.889 --> 13:28.432
So, neither of you were able to help him
control his anger?

13:28.516 --> 13:31.935
You just went over there, went all
Thunderdome and got arrested?

13:32.020 --> 13:35.522
-What's that?
-No one knows that movie?

13:35.607 --> 13:39.109
For your information,
Mr. Jump-To-Conclusions-Face,

13:39.194 --> 13:43.614
we calmly went over there
to dialogue with them.

13:43.698 --> 13:47.618
Turns out they were really nice
and had tequila shooters.

13:47.702 --> 13:51.121
Lots and lots of tequila shooters.

13:51.206 --> 13:54.833
Tequila? What were you thinking?
lt's the Mel Gibson of alcohol.

13:55.710 --> 13:58.670
But then when the cops got there,
Patrick screwed up everything.

13:58.755 --> 14:00.881
All l asked was if they knew
where the cowboy,

14:00.965 --> 14:04.092
the construction worker,
and the lndian were. What?

14:04.177 --> 14:06.845
Then, and you'll be proud of us for this,

14:06.930 --> 14:11.058
somebody else started a fight.
We just ran away.

14:11.601 --> 14:14.478
l found us an awesome hiding place in
the back of a car.

14:14.562 --> 14:18.357
Turns out it was a cop car.
God, we were drunk.

14:20.902 --> 14:24.613
Then they got one phone call.
They called me.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.156
So, wait a second.

14:26.241 --> 14:28.951
So Patrick got mad and he called Ed,
but he wouldn't come over?

14:29.035 --> 14:30.494
-Yeah.
-Yes.

14:30.578 --> 14:32.621
And then Lacey and Nolan came over and
you all got drunk,

14:32.705 --> 14:34.164
told off a cop, and got arrested?

14:34.249 --> 14:35.791
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.085
-And you called Ed to bail you out?
-Yeah.

14:38.169 --> 14:40.712
-You called Ed instead of me?
-Yeah.

14:40.797 --> 14:43.715
Phone system works!

14:46.886 --> 14:48.679
Oh, great.

14:50.765 --> 14:52.057
Charlie?

14:53.309 --> 14:54.768
-Charlie!
-lt's not what you think!

14:54.852 --> 14:56.645
She's the maid. l slipped. lt just happened.

14:56.729 --> 14:58.772
l was drunk. l'm sorry.
Please don't leave me.

15:01.651 --> 15:03.777
Charlie, it's 201 2.

15:03.861 --> 15:07.030
What? Right. We're divorced.

15:07.115 --> 15:09.324
Man, that was like riding a bicycle.

15:09.409 --> 15:12.077
Hi, l'm Jen. Charlie cheated on me a lot.

15:13.079 --> 15:14.955
Hi, l'm Allie, and l kind of figured that out.

15:16.457 --> 15:18.166
Hey, do you have the check for Sam's camp?

15:18.251 --> 15:19.751
Yeah, it's in the kitchen.

15:19.836 --> 15:24.006
Got it. Nice meeting you.
Thanks for the trip down memory lane.

15:27.302 --> 15:30.137
You know, if we start again right now,

15:30.221 --> 15:32.472
she might catch us on the way back out.

15:33.266 --> 15:35.225
Nah, she'll leave through the kitchen.

15:35.310 --> 15:39.146
You know, we could go do it on the front
lawn, see if we get on Google Earth.

15:40.356 --> 15:42.733
Yeah, l've already done that.

15:43.276 --> 15:45.902
l'll show you later.

15:50.033 --> 15:53.243
Crap! Kate. Just a sec.

16:01.878 --> 16:04.546
-Hey.
-Hey, Charlie. Can l borrow your binoculars?

16:04.631 --> 16:07.591
l'm skipping work to go to the Heritage
Blues Festival with Victor.

16:07.675 --> 16:08.925
You're probably in a hurry.
Why don't you go back

16:09.010 --> 16:10.344
out to your car and l'll bring them to you?

16:10.428 --> 16:14.514
Actually, l've got 20 minutes. Why don't we
go upstairs and knock out a quick one?

16:14.807 --> 16:17.184
Are you kidding?
You've got to get to a blues festival early.

16:17.310 --> 16:20.896
Half of the fun is watching the blind
musicians try to make it to the stage.

16:21.773 --> 16:22.939
You know what?
l think they're in the kitchen.

16:23.024 --> 16:25.192
lt's the big room with the stove.

16:28.029 --> 16:31.531
-Are they in one of these drawers?
-l think so.

16:33.826 --> 16:36.078
No. lt's all just cooking stuff.

16:37.330 --> 16:39.665
They're in one of these drawers somewhere.

16:40.625 --> 16:42.584
Check the pantry.

16:44.379 --> 16:45.837
l don't see them.

16:45.922 --> 16:47.464
Look on the top shelf.

16:49.050 --> 16:50.467
l don't think they're here.

16:50.551 --> 16:53.136
Go back, go back. And look again.

16:53.638 --> 16:55.097
Charlie, this is...

16:55.765 --> 16:57.140
Here they are.

16:57.225 --> 17:00.727
See? There. You're all set.
You better get going.

17:03.439 --> 17:05.357
Okay, go. l mean, come on.

17:08.736 --> 17:12.656
Drive safe. Enjoy the songs of hard times
and racial oppression.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.575
Thanks. See you later.

17:20.581 --> 17:23.417
That was so much fun.
How turned on are you right now?

17:23.501 --> 17:25.544
Not as much as you.

17:25.628 --> 17:27.087
Where's Kate going?

17:27.171 --> 17:31.299
-To a blues festival.
-Let's do it in her office.

17:31.384 --> 17:33.093
That'd be insane.

17:33.177 --> 17:36.179
You're not kidding. l don't think we should.

17:36.264 --> 17:38.765
l know we shouldn't.

17:38.850 --> 17:41.893
But we're going to, aren't we?

17:41.978 --> 17:45.188
By the way, remember how you thought
l was really smart?

17:45.273 --> 17:47.190
-Yeah.
-You were wrong.

17:50.945 --> 17:52.362
Oh, wow.

17:53.448 --> 17:57.993
How perfect is it that Kate trusts you enough
to give you a key to her office?

17:58.870 --> 18:01.121
Have you ever
fantasized about having sex in here?

18:01.205 --> 18:03.290
Fantasized? No.

18:04.292 --> 18:05.625
Well, l have.

18:11.466 --> 18:14.801
This is so exciting. Come here.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.136
You know, this may sound crazy,

18:16.220 --> 18:18.722
but l think l'm having
one of those bungee jump moments.

18:18.806 --> 18:20.182
What?

18:20.349 --> 18:21.558
lt all sounds great when you sign up,

18:21.642 --> 18:24.936
but then all of a sudden
you're up there, ready to go, and you think,

18:25.021 --> 18:27.689
"Who's that screaming?"
And you realize, "Oh, it's me."

18:28.983 --> 18:33.153
Yeah, and then you jump and you never
knew anything could be so exhilarating.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.367
l'm going to set the mood a little bit.

18:47.668 --> 18:50.253
Okay.
So the mood is set for all of Santa Monica.

18:51.547 --> 18:53.089
This is so hot.

18:53.633 --> 18:56.134
We have to do it on the couch.

18:56.219 --> 19:00.430
Or, different idea,
we go down to the parking garage

19:00.515 --> 19:02.265
and we do it in Kate's spot.

19:02.350 --> 19:05.352
lt says "head in only," but we can back in.

19:07.563 --> 19:09.689
l can't have sex on this couch.

19:09.774 --> 19:12.275
Hey, you said you wanted to do this.
You can't just get me all revved up

19:12.360 --> 19:14.277
and then not follow through.

19:14.362 --> 19:17.823
Well, okay, you can,
but then you have to finish strong.

19:18.032 --> 19:22.369
l'm sorry, but Kate's my best friend
and l just can't do this to her.

19:22.453 --> 19:23.703
l don't know what it's called for the ladies,

19:23.788 --> 19:26.039
but l think l'm blue-balling you.

19:27.208 --> 19:30.836
There is no word for it because no one ever
turned down sex from a hot woman.

19:30.920 --> 19:34.422
Let me tell you, l'm not crazy about
being the first,

19:34.507 --> 19:36.967
but this is really, really unhealthy.

19:37.051 --> 19:38.468
l think we both might want to do a little work

19:38.553 --> 19:41.638
with Kate on our obsessions
with dangerous sex.

19:41.722 --> 19:43.807
That might be your problem,
but that's not mine.

19:43.891 --> 19:46.685
l went to see Kate
because l was morbidly shy.

19:46.769 --> 19:50.939
Oh, well, in that case, you're making
terrific progress.

19:54.735 --> 19:59.072
On my couch? l just had that cleaned.

20:00.408 --> 20:04.244
l told you, nothing happened. l felt horrible
and l shut the entire thing down.

20:04.328 --> 20:05.745
l'm really sorry.

20:05.830 --> 20:07.581
Okay. Okay.

20:09.208 --> 20:13.169
Thank you for telling me.
At least now l know

20:13.254 --> 20:16.840
that when Allie talks about that old
guy who pink-balled her...

20:17.592 --> 20:18.633
Pink-balled?

20:18.718 --> 20:21.011
Blue-balling for women.

20:21.095 --> 20:24.556
l knew l wasn't the first. Old guy?

20:26.309 --> 20:31.605
Just so you know, l think a little of
this might be my fault.

20:32.940 --> 20:35.400
l should have never teased you
about Victor.

20:35.484 --> 20:40.363
l wouldn't be your friend if l didn't think
your intellect wasn't, you know,

20:40.448 --> 20:42.032
borderline above average.

20:43.326 --> 20:45.660
l'd probably still sleep with you, though.

20:45.745 --> 20:47.621
Charlie like.

20:48.956 --> 20:51.499
By the way, Victor and l are done.

20:51.626 --> 20:53.251
Really? What happened?

20:53.336 --> 20:54.878
He wrote me a love sonnet.

20:54.962 --> 20:59.466
Rookie mistake.
No wonder this guy's 90 and single.

20:59.926 --> 21:02.218
He's just not my type of guy.

21:03.846 --> 21:05.096
Come over here?

21:05.181 --> 21:07.724
l'd love to, but Jen's going to be over
any minute.

21:07.808 --> 21:09.809
So, you're afraid she'll catch us?

21:10.645 --> 21:12.020
You know how you just said l was smart?

21:12.355 --> 21:15.106
-Yeah.
-You were wrong.
