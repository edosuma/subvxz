Ugh! Man, I'm just trying to get
where we're going faster.

Cloaked or not, we can't do
anything to blow our cover right now.

02:51.504 --> 02:54.674
We have to get to Tuco undetected
so we can bleed him for info:

02:54.757 --> 02:56.175
find out what he knows,

02:56.259 --> 03:00.597
how he was involved with the attack
on headquarters, and why he framed us.

03:00.972 --> 03:05.310
Hey! We decided that Uncle Tuco
would never do something like that.

03:05.393 --> 03:07.061
I think you decided that.

Tuco's my brother from another mother -
who's my nana!

03:15.945 --> 03:17.947
I'm not siding. I'm just saying...

03:18.531 --> 03:21.701
Look at him! That's the face of a criminal
if I've ever seen one.

03:22.035 --> 03:24.370
Aw, you mean this face?

03:24.454 --> 03:27.165
[high voice] I would never do anything
to harm my family!

03:27.248 --> 03:29.792
I'm Uncle Tuco! Yeah!

03:29.876 --> 03:32.587
If you're so innocent,
why are you wearing a mask?

03:32.670 --> 03:35.173
And don't lie to me!
I'll crack you like an egg.

03:35.673 --> 03:40.136
Okay... Look, we're gonna talk to him,
but just to prove he's innocent.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.096
If Tuco didn't frame us, then who did?

-[atmospheric music plays]
-Uh... I don't know.

Sorry. I'm just kind of
on a scaring-people kick today.

-Nice! Now I need some more chips.

04:12.043 --> 04:15.505
You know, I wasn't sure about
this whole "man's best friend" thing,

04:15.588 --> 04:18.675
but Roscoe brings me the bag,
and he cleans my fingers.

04:19.133 --> 04:20.218
[in unison] Ew!

-What? Dogs' mouths are sterile.

-[all] Ew!

04:26.015 --> 04:26.849
Ugh!

04:26.933 --> 04:28.268
So, here's the plan.

04:28.351 --> 04:31.729
We get boots on the ground in Mexico City,
and start searching for Tuco.

04:31.813 --> 04:35.066
Bad idea. We won't be able to
move a muscle in that city

04:35.149 --> 04:36.901
without getting caught on God's Eye.

04:37.860 --> 04:40.154
[baby-talk voice] Even a dog
can understand that.

04:40.613 --> 04:43.574
Look, Ms. Nowhere, we get it.
You think you know more than us.

04:43.658 --> 04:44.617
I do.

04:45.034 --> 04:47.829
-And you're convinced Tuco is guilty.
-He is.

04:47.912 --> 04:49.664
But you're not our leader anymore.

04:49.747 --> 04:53.459
We're all on the run together, okay?
We make decisions together.

04:53.543 --> 04:56.170
-[dramatic music plays]
-Yeah! Take that! Pfft...

04:56.254 --> 04:58.464
Thinking Uncle Tuco's guilty... Dumb.

04:58.548 --> 05:02.218
Looks like you're not the boss anymore,
boss. So, what is your thing?

05:02.802 --> 05:03.803
My "thing"?

05:03.886 --> 05:06.973
Yeah! Cisco's the gearhead,
Layla's the outlaw,

05:07.056 --> 05:08.891
I'm the techie heartthrob...

05:10.184 --> 05:13.396
-I'm the warrior artist. [grunts]
-[dramatic music plays]

05:14.314 --> 05:16.774
Maybe you're the crazy dog lady?

05:17.150 --> 05:18.359

-My thing is I'm in charge!
-[barks]

05:21.029 --> 05:22.613
No, that was your old thing!

05:22.697 --> 05:24.866

05:25.241 --> 05:26.200
-Uh...
-[phone beeps]

05:26.617 --> 05:29.454
Uh... You're the glue
that holds us all together!

05:29.537 --> 05:32.165
-[stirring music plays]
-That's right. I am the glue.

05:32.540 --> 05:36.377
Okay, guys. Come on, gather around.
'Cause we're about to get glued...

05:38.921 --> 05:40.298
I'll work on that catchphrase.

05:40.381 --> 05:42.425
Uh... Let's stick together?

05:43.092 --> 05:45.136
Yeah, that seems better... Alright, look.

05:45.219 --> 05:46.512
We're almost in Mexico City,

05:46.596 --> 05:49.807
so if we can't get out and walk around,
what are we supposed to do?

05:49.891 --> 05:51.517
Guys, check out this video.

05:51.976 --> 05:53.936
Is it that groundhog
that calls people Fred?

05:54.020 --> 05:57.106
-No.
-Layla, not now. We have to find Tuco.

05:57.190 --> 05:59.525
-It's not--
-And the ghost guys. Don't forget them.

05:59.609 --> 06:02.070
-Guys--
-Right! The ghost guys.

06:03.696 --> 06:07.158
That's right. Outlaw ghosts,
right here in Mexico City.

06:07.241 --> 06:08.117
What?

06:08.201 --> 06:09.869
-See?
-Where did you find this?

06:10.369 --> 06:14.332
I reached out to some underground contacts
to see if anyone knew about a ghost crew.

06:14.749 --> 06:15.833
[quietly] Outlaw...

06:16.334 --> 06:17.710
Here's the witness now.

06:17.794 --> 06:20.338
-Please leave me alone.
-Sir, you're the museum curator.

06:20.421 --> 06:23.549
You claim a group of ghosts
robbed one of your exhibits?

06:23.633 --> 06:24.467
Is that right?

06:24.550 --> 06:27.386
They appeared out of nowhere.
I'm telling the truth!

06:27.470 --> 06:32.683
Sorry you had to be
a specter-tator to that, sir. [chuckles]

06:32.767 --> 06:34.811
I'm sorry, I am so sorry.

06:34.894 --> 06:37.730
It's just a little hard to... boo-lieve!

06:37.814 --> 06:40.399
[laughs] I did it again, I'm so sorry.

06:40.983 --> 06:41.901
Did you hear that?

06:41.984 --> 06:44.153
Yeah, those puns were... ruff!

06:44.737 --> 06:46.531
-Am I right, Roscoe?
-[whines]

06:46.906 --> 06:49.617
That sounds exactly like
what happened to us! When was this?

06:49.700 --> 06:50.743
Yesterday.

06:50.827 --> 06:53.913
Looks like we just got a non-Tuco lead.

06:53.996 --> 06:56.207
I'll be here
when you're ready to apologize.

06:57.458 --> 06:58.459
I can wait.

-[tense music plays]
-Tell me, what did these "ghosts" steal?

07:38.624 --> 07:40.293
A black obsidian ring.

07:40.626 --> 07:41.836
Must be worth a lot.

07:42.128 --> 07:43.671
Actually, not really.

07:43.754 --> 07:46.048
[curator] It was
one of three remaining artifacts

07:46.132 --> 07:50.178
from an ancient pre-Aztec culture
most people have never even heard of.

07:50.261 --> 07:53.347
One of three?
What are the other two artifacts?

07:53.431 --> 07:55.600
A ceremonial headdress, and a--

07:55.683 --> 07:58.186
Jewel jaguar's tooth.

07:58.269 --> 08:00.313
I know who framed us.

08:00.396 --> 08:01.439
[dramatic music plays]

08:02.523 --> 08:05.902
His code name was Moray.
He was a tech engineer genius.

08:05.985 --> 08:08.029
The agency contracted him about twenty--

08:08.446 --> 08:12.617
[clears throat] A few years ago,
when I was a really junior agent.

08:12.700 --> 08:14.076
Your age, maybe younger.

08:14.160 --> 08:15.995
He was hired to design new spy tech.

08:16.954 --> 08:20.500
[Ms. Nowhere] Wow!
I am really killing it in this picture!

08:20.583 --> 08:26.589
My look tells a story, and that story is,
"Oh, okay! She bad!"

08:26.672 --> 08:28.049
[sighs]

08:28.132 --> 08:29.175
Sure...

08:29.258 --> 08:32.053
So how does Moray
connect to the stolen artifacts?

08:32.136 --> 08:33.846
Moray was a total weirdo,

08:33.930 --> 08:38.851
always going on about
some ancient apocalyptic prophecy.

08:38.935 --> 08:42.730
He got so obsessed with that nonsense
that the agency had to let him go.

08:42.813 --> 08:45.316
So you think he's the one behind all this?

08:45.399 --> 08:49.695
Right before he was fired, he gave me
a jaguar tooth made out of ancient jewels,

08:49.779 --> 08:51.197
said it was important.

08:51.280 --> 08:55.576
Not exactly something you can wear out,
so I threw it in the agency vault.

08:55.660 --> 08:57.453
That's what he stole from headquarters!

08:58.037 --> 09:00.289
And now that he's got the obsidian ring...

09:00.373 --> 09:01.749
He's after the headdress.

09:01.832 --> 09:03.793
So Uncle Tuco's name is cleared!

09:03.876 --> 09:05.920
Still waiting for that apology.

09:06.003 --> 09:09.590
[laughing] I don't think so...
They could be working together!

09:10.091 --> 09:12.635
You know the saying:
guilty 'til proven innocent.

09:12.718 --> 09:14.303
No, that's not the saying.

09:14.387 --> 09:17.765
Yo, there's no way my uncle would
work for a crazy guy like that.

09:17.848 --> 09:21.519
My uncle's scared of conspiracy theories.
He doesn't want to be part of one.

09:21.602 --> 09:23.062
Found the headdress!

09:23.479 --> 09:25.898
[Frostee] It's been locked in a vault
for 30 years,

09:25.982 --> 09:30.111
but tonight, it'll be at a gala
at some fancy mansion here in Mexico City!

09:30.611 --> 09:33.948
Diplomats and foreign dignitaries
will be there-- Ooh!

09:34.031 --> 09:36.409
[sing-songy] And it's a masquerade!

09:36.492 --> 09:38.869
That's the perfect place
for Moray to make his move.

09:38.953 --> 09:41.414
We have to be there
to catch him and clear our names.

09:41.497 --> 09:44.875
Security will be crazy
with that many suits in one place.

09:45.376 --> 09:50.298
-How are we going to get an invite?
-Please! You think I get asked to parties?

09:51.591 --> 09:54.635
-I prefer to show up uninvited.

Where are they?

10:09.692 --> 10:12.278
There's a site called Family Daters.
You'd kill on that.

10:12.653 --> 10:13.988
Don't toy with me!

10:14.071 --> 10:16.449
Tell me everything you know.

10:19.160 --> 10:21.871
Ah, you're talking to
a stone-cold outlaw, pal.

10:35.384 --> 10:36.677
I saw them two days ago.

10:36.761 --> 10:39.513
They were heading to Mexico City,
looking to make some cash.

That's all I know.

You'll only have a couple seconds
while I'm shaking hands

11:02.787 --> 11:05.748
to clone their bracelet's code
and implant it into mine.
