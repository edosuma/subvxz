00:00.420 --> 00:02.830
♪♪

00:04.920 --> 00:06.170
- Previously...
- Where are you going?

00:06.170 --> 00:08.250
Just to see
my boyfriend Brady.

00:08.250 --> 00:10.120
Did you just say
your boyfriend Brady?

00:10.120 --> 00:13.170
She can't know that you're a
spy and I'm your handler.

00:13.170 --> 00:15.290
We think that KC
might be giving intel

00:15.290 --> 00:17.420
to the Other Side.

00:17.420 --> 00:19.500
Your mission
is to get her to talk.

00:19.500 --> 00:22.080
So, tell me more
about this mission.

00:22.080 --> 00:23.420
Marisa's on board.

00:23.420 --> 00:25.500
She doesn't suspect a thing.

00:28.880 --> 00:30.500
Hey, Marisa,
I need your help

00:30.500 --> 00:32.920
picking out a dress for
the homecoming dance.

00:32.920 --> 00:36.250
Ernie, help. Enemy agents have
turned KC into an actual girl.

00:37.880 --> 00:40.500
Does the new one not hog
the bathroom all morning?

00:40.500 --> 00:41.790
Because if so,
I'm on board.

00:43.500 --> 00:47.000
You're the one who told me
this is our year of lasts,

00:47.000 --> 00:49.500
so I figured I'd go
to the homecoming dance.

00:49.500 --> 00:50.880
Unless you don't
want me to.

00:50.880 --> 00:52.460
No, no, no,
it's amazing.

00:52.460 --> 00:54.210
The five of us
will have a great time.

00:54.210 --> 00:56.040
Wait a minute,
the five of us?

00:56.040 --> 00:57.540
Marisa, we've been
through this.

00:57.540 --> 01:00.580
You can only bring
one date.

01:00.580 --> 01:04.040
No, the five of us.
Me and Brady.

01:04.040 --> 01:05.540
Me and Monique,

01:05.540 --> 01:09.290
and you and,
well, you.

01:09.290 --> 01:10.830
Ha ha!

01:10.830 --> 01:12.460
For your information,

01:12.460 --> 01:14.380
I do have someone
to go with.

01:14.380 --> 01:16.880
KC, it's okay.
You don't have to pretend.

01:16.880 --> 01:19.330
A lot of people
go to the dance alone.

01:19.330 --> 01:22.830
I wouldn't do it,
but a lot of people do.

01:22.830 --> 01:24.460
No, seriously.

01:24.460 --> 01:26.500
Like, I've been talking
to this really cool guy.

01:26.500 --> 01:29.290
Yeah? Does this mystery
boy have a name?

01:29.290 --> 01:32.000
Of course, okay?
Everybody has a name.

01:32.000 --> 01:34.670
His name is, um,

01:34.670 --> 01:36.330
Trey.

01:37.880 --> 01:39.790
- Trey? - Yeah. - Trey what?

01:39.790 --> 01:42.250
Trey...

01:42.250 --> 01:45.120
Appleton.

01:45.120 --> 01:47.290
His name's Trey Appleton?

01:47.290 --> 01:49.670
Junior.

01:49.670 --> 01:51.000
Trey Appleton Junior.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.920
But I call him Trey-J.

01:52.920 --> 01:55.420
We got little nicknames
for each other and stuff.

01:55.420 --> 01:56.920
What does he call you?

01:56.920 --> 01:59.380
KC.

02:01.380 --> 02:04.960
It's kinda new, so we're
still working on it.

02:04.960 --> 02:09.670
I cannot wait to meet
this Trey Appleton Junior.

02:09.670 --> 02:11.330
Yeah.

02:11.330 --> 02:13.500
Neither can I.

I keep it

03:06.880 --> 03:10.500
The Other Side is in
total disarray since--

03:10.500 --> 03:12.040
My family
took down Zane?

03:12.040 --> 03:14.420
Yes, but
the remaining agents

03:14.420 --> 03:16.620
are negotiating
to buy the plans

03:16.620 --> 03:18.120
for a treacherous
new weapon

03:18.120 --> 03:20.500
with the secret code
name, Storm Maker.

03:20.500 --> 03:22.710
If that's some type of
weather controller,

03:22.710 --> 03:25.170
they might need
a new secret code name.

03:25.170 --> 03:27.380
Yes, you're right again.

03:29.290 --> 03:32.460
It's satellite based,
and can cause catastrophic

03:32.460 --> 03:34.170
man-made weather disasters.

03:34.170 --> 03:35.500
So basically, you need me
to retrieve it

03:35.500 --> 03:37.330
before the Other Side
gets their hands on it.

03:37.330 --> 03:40.250
Okay, so if you're
so good at guessing everything

03:40.250 --> 03:42.880
before I say it,
what am I gonna say next?

03:42.880 --> 03:44.670
- Get out.
- Get out!

03:46.380 --> 03:47.920
I'll take that as a yes.

03:58.290 --> 04:00.460
Hey, how you doing?

04:00.460 --> 04:03.500
KC, what are you
doing here?

04:03.500 --> 04:04.960
Just thought I'd stop by
and check out

04:04.960 --> 04:07.330
the cool gadgets
you're working on.

04:07.330 --> 04:09.170
Wow!

04:09.170 --> 04:11.710
I didn't think you knew
who I was.

04:11.710 --> 04:14.000
Don't be silly...

04:15.080 --> 04:17.250
Howard.

04:17.250 --> 04:19.830
Okay, so check
this out.

04:19.830 --> 04:21.710
Looks like a normal
set of keys, right?

04:21.710 --> 04:24.460
But push this button,
boom, instant grappling hook.

04:24.460 --> 04:26.170
Oh, very cool.
Hey, can I check it out?

04:29.120 --> 04:31.080
( glass shatters )

04:31.080 --> 04:34.000
My bad, Karl.

04:37.420 --> 04:39.710
You would actually make
a great field agent.

04:39.710 --> 04:41.500
All you need
is a little training

04:41.500 --> 04:43.120
from someone who's
done it before.

04:43.120 --> 04:45.830
Hey, look at that,
I've done it before.

04:45.830 --> 04:47.460
So what do you say
I give you some pointers,

04:47.460 --> 04:49.790
maybe Saturday night
at 6:00, bring a corsage.

04:49.790 --> 04:52.460
That would be great.
Why a corsage?

04:52.460 --> 04:54.500
Who's training
who here, Howard?

04:55.710 --> 04:58.330
Or should I say
Trey Appleton Junior?

05:03.920 --> 05:05.920
Hey.

05:05.920 --> 05:08.290
How was school today?
Learn anything new?

05:08.290 --> 05:10.330
Yeah, the human elbow
only bends so far.

05:12.790 --> 05:14.290
Which reminds me.

05:14.290 --> 05:15.960
I need to write
an apology note to Diane,

05:15.960 --> 05:17.670
and you need to sign
this teacher's slip.

05:17.670 --> 05:19.380
What's this?

05:19.380 --> 05:21.960
Oh, the school's having
a stupid father-daughter dance.

05:21.960 --> 05:23.250
Why didn't you tell me?

05:23.250 --> 05:26.460
Because it's a stupid
father-daughter dance.

05:26.460 --> 05:28.460
But it'll be fun.

05:28.460 --> 05:30.500
Then you go.
I'm out.

05:30.500 --> 05:32.500
No, no, no,
no, no, no.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.290
You're in. We're doing
this together.

05:34.290 --> 05:37.460
Why are you making
such a big deal about this?

05:37.460 --> 05:39.460
All right, look,
here's the thing.

05:39.460 --> 05:41.920
I never got to do
any of these dances with KC.

05:41.920 --> 05:44.120
I was always too busy
with work.

05:44.120 --> 05:46.540
Now I get a second chance
with my youngest daughter.

05:46.540 --> 05:49.290
Really? Does Agent Kira
know about her?

05:53.540 --> 05:56.120
All right, so we gotta leave
for the dance around 7:00,

05:56.120 --> 05:57.670
- so Trey should probably--
- Hmm.

05:57.670 --> 05:58.920
What?

05:58.920 --> 06:00.420
Oh, nothing.
You were saying.

06:00.420 --> 06:02.580
Okay, is it just
my imagination,

06:02.580 --> 06:04.380
or every time I say Trey,

06:04.380 --> 06:06.540
do you do this little
dismissive "Hmm" sound?

06:06.540 --> 06:09.670
- Who? - Trey. - Hmm.

06:09.670 --> 06:11.330
See, you just did it.

06:11.330 --> 06:12.960
Again.

06:12.960 --> 06:15.330
I think you think
he doesn't exist.

06:15.330 --> 06:17.080
Oh, no, that's just
the sound I make

06:17.080 --> 06:19.120
when I'm really excited
to meet Trey Appleton Junior,

06:19.120 --> 06:20.960
a real person
who definitely exists,

06:20.960 --> 06:22.380
and you didn't just
make him up

06:22.380 --> 06:25.380
because you don't have
a date to the dance.

06:25.380 --> 06:27.080
Believe what you want,

06:27.080 --> 06:28.670
but me and Trey are
definitely gonna be there.

06:28.670 --> 06:30.040
( cell phone chimes )

06:31.710 --> 06:34.120
Oh, great. Agent Johnson
just moved my mission

06:34.120 --> 06:35.460
to Saturday night.

06:35.460 --> 06:39.460
Wow. A last-minute mission.
Very creative.

06:39.460 --> 06:42.040
I thought you were gonna
go with one of the classics,

06:42.040 --> 06:44.710
like the flu or my dog
ate my Trey.

06:47.500 --> 06:49.540
For the last time,
Trey is real.

06:49.540 --> 06:51.040
I'm just gonna do
the mission a little early,

06:51.040 --> 06:53.460
and we'll meet you
at the dance afterwards.

06:53.460 --> 06:55.460
You will see how cute
and nice and funny he is

06:55.460 --> 06:57.330
when he calls me
by my nickname.

06:57.330 --> 06:59.290
- Which was?
- KC.

06:59.290 --> 07:01.170
Okay? We're still
working on it.

07:04.750 --> 07:07.290
Hey.

07:07.290 --> 07:08.500
( laughs )

07:08.500 --> 07:10.500
Guess who's gonna be
the best-dressed

07:10.500 --> 07:13.420
at the father-daughter
dance?

07:13.420 --> 07:15.460
Looks a little small,
but you do you.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.540
Hey, you know
this is for you,

07:19.540 --> 07:21.500
and you're gonna wear it,
and we're gonna enjoy

07:21.500 --> 07:22.710
quality
father-daughter time together,

07:22.710 --> 07:24.670
or do I need to send you
up to your box

07:24.670 --> 07:26.500
until you adjust
your attitude?

07:26.500 --> 07:28.380
Fine. I'll wear it.

07:28.380 --> 07:30.880
So, when you wanna
start rehearsing?

07:30.880 --> 07:32.420
Rehearsing for what?

07:32.420 --> 07:33.620
Oh, didn't I tell you

07:33.620 --> 07:35.120
there's a big
dance competition?

07:35.120 --> 07:36.880
Dance competition?

07:36.880 --> 07:38.500
Oh, yeah.
All the girls put on

07:38.500 --> 07:40.710
a highly choreographed,
show-stopping dance routine

07:40.710 --> 07:42.460
with their dads.

07:42.460 --> 07:44.330
Of course, the girls
are just kids,

07:44.330 --> 07:48.330
so it's all riding on
how good the dad is.

07:48.330 --> 07:50.500
They never had
a competition before.

07:50.500 --> 07:52.080
How would you know?

07:52.080 --> 07:53.920
You were always too busy
to go with KC.

08:00.330 --> 08:02.380
Come on, Ernie.
This song is hot.

08:07.500 --> 08:09.380
I'm so excited that you
asked me to this dance, Ernie.

08:09.380 --> 08:11.330
You may
find this surprising,

08:11.330 --> 08:13.170
but nobody ever
asks me to dance,

08:13.170 --> 08:15.330
and I could dance
all night.

08:15.330 --> 08:18.460
But then you'd
get dehydrated.

08:18.460 --> 08:21.250
In fact, I better go
get you some punch.

08:25.330 --> 08:27.460
Did you find out
KC's mission yet?

08:27.460 --> 08:29.380
Not yet, but when
she gets here,

08:29.380 --> 08:31.210
I will pump her for information
and make sure she's following

08:31.210 --> 08:34.750
- the Organization's orders.
- Good work, Agent Marisa.

08:34.750 --> 08:37.750
I guess to keep our cover, we should
probably dance a little bit, huh?

08:37.750 --> 08:39.420
Yeah.

08:40.710 --> 08:42.710
Um, you know what?

08:42.710 --> 08:45.540
Maybe we should wait until
Monique is done dancing.

08:50.500 --> 08:52.960
I cannot believe
how intense that mission was.

08:52.960 --> 08:55.960
Hey, you know those guys
who fell off the roof?

08:55.960 --> 08:57.880
They're gonna be
okay, right?

08:57.880 --> 08:59.290
Sure, why not?

09:00.920 --> 09:03.750
Okay, all we have to do is
put these plans we retrieved

09:03.750 --> 09:05.380
into my locker,
then we can go dance.

09:05.380 --> 09:07.420
Okay, I know
I'm new at this,

09:07.420 --> 09:09.620
but you did say that
whoever had those plans

09:09.620 --> 09:11.380
could kind of destroy
the entire world.

09:12.960 --> 09:16.290
So would a school locker be
the safest place to put them?

09:16.290 --> 09:19.080
Howard, who's the field
agent here, me or you?

09:19.080 --> 09:20.500
Of course you are, but--

09:20.500 --> 09:21.670
Bup-bup-bup-bup-bup.

09:23.420 --> 09:24.750
I'm just gonna
put them in my locker.

09:24.750 --> 09:26.580
No one will know
they're there.

09:26.580 --> 09:28.420
Then we'll retrieve 'em
after the dance.

09:36.210 --> 09:38.380
All right, the spy school
is back in session.

09:38.380 --> 09:40.290
The most important thing
when going undercover

09:40.290 --> 09:42.710
is to have
a good backstory.

09:42.710 --> 09:45.460
Oh, here's one I just came up
with off the top of my head.

09:45.460 --> 09:48.170
Why don't we pretend
to be a couple?

09:48.170 --> 09:49.500
( forced laugh )

09:49.500 --> 09:51.500
That will be fun, right?

09:51.500 --> 09:52.960
Oh, by the way, your name
is Trey Appleton Junior.

09:57.500 --> 09:58.920
Hey.

09:58.920 --> 10:00.500
Wow, you look amazing.

10:00.500 --> 10:01.880
Um, I want you to meet...

10:01.880 --> 10:03.620
Trey Appleton Junior.
You must be Marisa.

10:03.620 --> 10:05.880
I have heard all about you.

10:05.880 --> 10:07.460
All she ever talks about
is Marisa.

10:07.460 --> 10:09.420
Marisa this, Marisa that,
Marisa, Marisa, Marisa.

10:09.420 --> 10:12.500
I swear, sometimes I'm like,
hello, what about me?

10:12.500 --> 10:14.460
What about
Trey Appleton Junior?

10:14.460 --> 10:17.040
Stop talking
about Marisa.

10:17.040 --> 10:19.330
Okay, Trey,
how about

10:19.330 --> 10:20.620
you go get us
some punch, all right?

10:20.620 --> 10:23.040
KC loves her punch.

10:23.040 --> 10:24.670
Funny story.

10:24.670 --> 10:26.420
The two of us were at my Aunt
Beebee's third wedding and...

10:26.420 --> 10:29.210
oh, KC, you tell it
so much better.

10:29.210 --> 10:31.330
Well, we went
to the wedding,

10:31.330 --> 10:32.830
he said yes,
she said yes,

10:32.830 --> 10:34.620
we had a little punch,
and that's about it.

10:34.620 --> 10:37.210
I better tell it.

10:37.210 --> 10:40.210
As smart as this one is, she doesn't
have much of a sense of humor.

10:40.210 --> 10:43.120
I know. Have you ever heard
her try to tell a joke?

10:43.120 --> 10:44.790
BOTH: The worst!

10:44.790 --> 10:48.040
Okay, why don't you go
get us some punch, Trey?

10:50.620 --> 10:52.420
So what do you think?

10:52.420 --> 10:54.380
I think that
he is adorable.

10:54.380 --> 10:56.170
I'm so sorry
I doubted you.

10:56.170 --> 10:59.210
Well, apology accepted.

10:59.210 --> 11:02.540
So what was the deal with that
whole last-minute urgent mission?

11:02.540 --> 11:04.880
I just had to go
retrieve some plans

11:04.880 --> 11:06.750
for this dangerous
weather machine thing,

11:06.750 --> 11:08.380
but I just stashed
'em in my locker.

11:08.380 --> 11:11.620
One glass of punch
for Marisa,

11:11.620 --> 11:14.080
and one glass
of punch for KC.

11:14.080 --> 11:15.460
Or as I like
to call her--

11:15.460 --> 11:17.500
KC.

11:17.500 --> 11:20.380
Yeah, we're still
working on it.

11:27.920 --> 11:30.380
Okay, I talked to
the deejay,

11:30.380 --> 11:31.420
and we're dancing first.

11:31.420 --> 11:33.120
Why do we have
to go first/

11:33.120 --> 11:34.500
So we can set
the bar high.

11:34.500 --> 11:37.620
It's called
intimidating the enemy.

11:37.620 --> 11:39.580
What enemy?

11:39.580 --> 11:42.250
That ten-year-old over
there picking her nose?

11:42.250 --> 11:44.670
Come on, we're here
to enjoy ourselves.

11:44.670 --> 11:47.290
Oh, don't worry.
It's about to get real fun.

11:49.620 --> 11:51.460
All right,
ladies and gentlemen,

11:51.460 --> 11:54.000
Judy and her dad Craig are about
to do a special dance for you,

11:54.000 --> 11:56.000
so put your hands together, give
'em a round of applause, please.

11:58.380 --> 11:59.460
You ready?

11:59.460 --> 12:02.380
Ready? I was born
ready, child.

12:02.380 --> 12:04.250
Let's get this.

12:07.460 --> 12:11.460
♪ ♪

12:23.420 --> 12:28.040
♪ ♪

12:37.500 --> 12:43.120
♪ ♪

13:04.290 --> 13:06.540
Ladies and gentlemen,
give it up for Craig,

13:06.540 --> 13:09.170
and his unusually strong
daughter Judy.

13:15.380 --> 13:18.500
You, uh, really know how to make
up a story there, Howard.

13:18.500 --> 13:20.620
I take free
improv classes.

13:20.620 --> 13:22.210
Well, you get
what you pay for.

13:24.500 --> 13:29.250
Anyway, KC had to steal the
plans for some weather thingy.

13:29.250 --> 13:31.710
You mean the plans
for the Storm Maker?

13:31.710 --> 13:34.380
I guess, yeah. Now she's
hiding them in her locker.

13:34.380 --> 13:36.380
Really?

13:36.380 --> 13:38.500
Her locker.

13:38.500 --> 13:40.460
Sounds like she's following
the Organization's orders.

13:40.460 --> 13:42.500
We don't have to worry about her
for the rest of the night.

13:42.500 --> 13:44.580
Awesome. So we can
just dance and have fun?

13:44.580 --> 13:46.880
Absolutely.

13:46.880 --> 13:49.420
Look, I have to say,
I know we're just pretending

13:49.420 --> 13:51.210
to be boyfriend
and girlfriend,

13:51.210 --> 13:53.000
but I'm having a lot of
fun hanging out with you.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.250
Same here.

13:58.500 --> 14:00.000
KC, what are you doing?

14:00.000 --> 14:01.290
What does it look
like I'm doing?

14:01.290 --> 14:04.080
I'm dancing with
my man, Trey.

14:04.080 --> 14:06.880
Interesting, because Trey
looks a lot like Howard,

14:06.880 --> 14:09.380
the junior gadget guy
from the Organization.

14:09.380 --> 14:12.000
Guess I just have
one of those faces.

14:13.290 --> 14:15.330
Kidding. It is me.

14:18.830 --> 14:21.540
There you are, Ernie. You ready
to slay on this dance floor?

14:21.540 --> 14:24.960
I think you've slayed
enough people on that floor.

14:24.960 --> 14:26.750
I mean, uh...

14:26.750 --> 14:28.880
I hurt my ankle.

14:28.880 --> 14:30.920
Oh, poor thing.
Don't worry.

14:30.920 --> 14:32.920
You can just stand there,
and I'll dance around you.

14:32.920 --> 14:34.290
( weakly ) Hooray.

14:48.880 --> 14:50.670
The Storm Maker plans.

14:50.670 --> 14:52.420
Oh, thank you, Organization.

14:52.420 --> 14:56.460
This is going to put
the Alternate on the map.

15:08.290 --> 15:10.120
I feel like my hair went flat;
can I borrow your comb?

15:10.120 --> 15:11.460
Oh, yeah.

15:16.330 --> 15:17.790
Oh, no.

15:17.790 --> 15:19.500
No, no, no, no!

15:19.500 --> 15:21.080
KC, relax. If you don't
have a comb,

15:21.080 --> 15:23.500
I can make a brush work.

15:23.500 --> 15:26.080
The plans that were
in my locker, they're gone.

15:31.920 --> 15:34.460
Plans for a top secret,
world-changing weapon,

15:34.460 --> 15:36.500
and you put them
in your locker?

15:36.500 --> 15:38.620
One word out of you, I'm
gonna put you in my locker.

15:38.620 --> 15:41.250
Maybe we should go check
the security footage

15:41.250 --> 15:43.420
- in the principal's office.
- Yeah, that's a good idea.

15:45.460 --> 15:47.250
Hey, where are
you guys going?

15:47.250 --> 15:49.420
Gonna check the security footage,
see who broke in my locker.

15:49.420 --> 15:52.120
Good luck.

15:55.290 --> 15:59.330
New development in Operation KC had that
thing in her locker and now it's gone.

15:59.330 --> 16:01.790
Just tell me
what you found out.

16:01.790 --> 16:05.380
KC had that thing in her
locker, and now it's gone.

16:05.380 --> 16:07.920
Good work.

16:11.420 --> 16:12.710
Okay, I'm in.

16:12.710 --> 16:15.540
KC, I just need
the approximate time

16:15.540 --> 16:17.880
of when you stupidly put
the plans in your locker.

16:17.880 --> 16:20.580
About 8:30, okay,
and one more word out of you,

16:20.580 --> 16:22.380
I swear, you are
this close

16:22.380 --> 16:24.790
to spending the rest
of the night in my locker.

16:24.790 --> 16:28.330
Well, there's room for me now
that the plans aren't in there.

16:34.620 --> 16:36.960
Right there.

16:42.500 --> 16:44.080
Ernie,
what's going on?

16:44.080 --> 16:45.500
I don't know.
It's as if someone's

16:45.500 --> 16:47.710
deleting the footage
before we can get to it.

16:47.710 --> 16:50.380
That makes no sense; nobody
even knows we're looking at it.

17:03.460 --> 17:06.290
So when are the rest of the dads
gonna dance with their daughters?

17:06.290 --> 17:07.750
Ha!

17:07.750 --> 17:09.540
What's so funny?

17:09.540 --> 17:12.500
Nobody else is dancing.

17:12.500 --> 17:15.380
What are you
talking about?

17:15.380 --> 17:18.670
There is no competition.
I made the whole thing up.

17:18.670 --> 17:21.170
So you did this
just to get back at me

17:21.170 --> 17:22.920
for making you
come to the dance?

17:22.920 --> 17:25.120
Yeah, but to be
completely honest,

17:25.120 --> 17:27.500
I also did it
to amuse myself.

17:30.170 --> 17:31.580
Well, you know what?

17:31.580 --> 17:33.290
The joke's on you,

17:33.290 --> 17:35.500
because I actually
had a great time tonight.

17:35.500 --> 17:37.290
- You did?
- Yeah.

17:37.290 --> 17:39.120
And I had fun
practicing.

17:39.120 --> 17:41.620
In fact, I enjoyed all the
time we spent together.

17:41.620 --> 17:43.750
- Really?
- Yes, really.

17:43.750 --> 17:47.080
I mean, KC's always
been my little girl,

17:47.080 --> 17:48.710
but she's practically
all grown up.

17:48.710 --> 17:50.460
But you...

17:50.460 --> 17:52.500
you're still
a little girl,

17:52.500 --> 17:56.500
even though you got the mouth
of an angry longshoreman.

17:56.500 --> 18:00.330
Daddy, you say
the sweetest things sometimes.

18:00.330 --> 18:01.670
Did you just
call me Daddy?

18:01.670 --> 18:04.460
Don't ruin it.

18:04.460 --> 18:07.000
And now,
for our final dance...

18:07.000 --> 18:08.920
( music starts )

18:08.920 --> 18:10.250
Ahh! Yes.

18:14.670 --> 18:16.210
May I have this dance?

18:21.420 --> 18:24.380
♪ ♪

18:31.580 --> 18:33.710
Who would know that the plans were
in my locker in the first place?

18:33.710 --> 18:37.330
Better question: who knew we were
checking the security footage?

18:37.330 --> 18:39.380
Nobody. Just us.

18:39.380 --> 18:41.710
Well, and Marisa.

18:41.710 --> 18:43.290
You told Marisa?

18:43.290 --> 18:46.460
Are there any rules
you actually do follow?

18:46.460 --> 18:48.750
Let me think, okay?

18:48.750 --> 18:51.250
It can't possibly be Marisa.
Could it?

18:51.250 --> 18:53.620
No, what am I saying?
Of course, she would never...

18:53.620 --> 18:55.920
I don't know, okay.
I need to go talk to her.

18:59.880 --> 19:01.750
Hey, Brady, do you mind
if I borrow Marisa a second?

19:01.750 --> 19:03.830
- Actually, we're--
- Thank you. Bye.

19:03.830 --> 19:05.620
I guess not.

19:08.500 --> 19:11.580
Marisa, I'm about
to ask you something,

19:11.580 --> 19:14.540
and I need you to be 100%
completely honest with me, okay?

19:14.540 --> 19:16.210
I'm always honest with you.

19:16.210 --> 19:19.170
Did you tell anybody
what was in my locker?

19:19.170 --> 19:20.750
- Of course not.
- Did you tell anybody

19:20.750 --> 19:22.710
that I was going
to check the security footage?

19:22.710 --> 19:25.080
Why would I tell anyone,
and who would I tell?

19:25.080 --> 19:27.290
I don't know.
Maybe your boyfriend Brady.

19:27.290 --> 19:29.710
Something seems off
about that guy.

19:29.710 --> 19:32.460
Like what? Like the
fact that he trusts me,

19:32.460 --> 19:34.750
which is actually more than
I can say about you right now.

19:34.750 --> 19:36.920
Honestly, if anyone
is suspicious,

19:36.920 --> 19:39.290
it's your "didn't know he existed
until two seconds ago" boyfriend.

19:39.290 --> 19:40.750
Maybe he's the one
you can't trust.

19:40.750 --> 19:42.290
You don't have
to worry about him.

19:42.290 --> 19:44.500
Howard's a well-respected
agent in the Organization.

19:44.500 --> 19:45.710
Howard?

19:45.710 --> 19:47.460
Howard?!

19:47.460 --> 19:50.880
Oh, wow!
Okay, I was right.

19:50.880 --> 19:52.710
You made him up.

19:52.710 --> 19:54.500
Admit it.
Admit it!

19:54.500 --> 19:56.460
Okay, fine, I made him up.

19:56.460 --> 19:59.080
But that's not
the point, okay.

19:59.080 --> 20:00.750
The point is that
he couldn't have done it,

20:00.750 --> 20:03.040
so the only person
who could've done it is you.

20:03.040 --> 20:05.460
Open your locker.

20:05.460 --> 20:06.920
No.

20:06.920 --> 20:09.040
- Marisa, open your locker.
- No.

20:09.040 --> 20:10.380
Marisa, I'm not asking,
I'm telling.

20:10.380 --> 20:11.620
Open the locker.

20:11.620 --> 20:12.920
Okay, fine, whatever.

20:12.920 --> 20:14.830
I will open my locker.

20:14.830 --> 20:16.880
I have absolutely
nothing to hide.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.670
Now what do you
have to say?

20:25.420 --> 20:27.330
The only thing I can say

20:27.330 --> 20:30.380
is that I'm
really sorry, Marisa.

20:30.380 --> 20:32.710
KC, I know you're
really stressed out

20:32.710 --> 20:34.670
about all this,
but honestly,

20:34.670 --> 20:36.500
you need to chill out.

20:36.500 --> 20:38.500
Why would you think
I would ever--

20:38.500 --> 20:41.460
I don't know, okay.
I'm really, really sorry.

20:41.460 --> 20:43.460
I just, I need to get
to the Organization,

20:43.460 --> 20:44.830
and tell 'em
what's going on.

20:48.830 --> 20:51.420
Hey.
How did that go?

20:51.420 --> 20:53.670
Nothing I couldn't handle.

20:53.670 --> 20:56.460
Look, I honestly can't believe
that she messed up again.

20:56.460 --> 20:58.540
I mean, I hate
to say this,

20:58.540 --> 21:00.960
but I don't think she should be
in the Organization anymore.

21:00.960 --> 21:03.500
Well, that's
not our call.

21:03.500 --> 21:05.540
We just
observe and report.

21:05.540 --> 21:07.960
Who do you think took the
plans from KC's locker?

21:07.960 --> 21:10.500
I have no idea.

21:11.830 --> 21:14.330
I should probably check
in with the Organization,

21:14.330 --> 21:16.080
but, uh,
meet you outside?

21:21.460 --> 21:22.330
Hey, have you seen KC?

21:22.330 --> 21:24.380
I'm pretty sure
she already left.

21:24.380 --> 21:26.000
Without me?

21:26.000 --> 21:28.500
Oh, man, she is
always doing this.

21:28.500 --> 21:30.710
It's one of our
biggest issues.

21:30.710 --> 21:33.500
Well, that and the fact that she
is constantly eating off my plate.

21:33.500 --> 21:35.830
I mean, hello,
you ordered your own meal.

21:35.830 --> 21:37.880
Try eating it.

21:37.880 --> 21:40.250
She's just lucky
I love her.

21:52.460 --> 21:54.500
Yeah, it's done.

21:54.500 --> 21:57.500
Marisa's still clueless.

21:57.500 --> 22:00.080
Operation Storm Maker
can proceed.

22:00.080 --> 22:02.460
This is gonna be
a game changer.

22:02.460 --> 22:04.710
Forget about
the Organization,

22:04.710 --> 22:06.420
and the Other Side.

22:06.420 --> 22:08.830
It's all about
the Alternate now.

22:14.290 --> 22:15.880
Rob, your name's on TV.
