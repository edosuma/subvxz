00:36.924 --> 00:38.236
Hallo?

00:42.170 --> 00:43.546
Hallo?

00:47.006 --> 00:48.601
Was machst du da?

00:51.157 --> 00:52.711
Hörst du mich?

00:59.213 --> 01:01.656
_

01:01.657 --> 01:04.251
_

01:12.719 --> 01:13.992
Thank you.

01:14.401 --> 01:15.788
What's going on, Ellie?

01:15.797 --> 01:18.306
Dorn's called an emergency
meeting in the conference room.

01:18.520 --> 01:19.924
You coming, Arabela?

01:19.957 --> 01:22.589
- Yes, I'll be right there.
- Hey.

01:23.084 --> 01:24.472
How many is that?

01:24.497 --> 01:26.590
Three, if you're counting.

01:30.406 --> 01:33.340
In sub-zero weather, early this morning.

01:33.460 --> 01:35.036
This, a yet

01:35.046 --> 01:36.643
unidentified woman,

01:36.664 --> 01:40.739
staggered off an Austrian mountain
side onto a rail-road bridge,

01:40.741 --> 01:42.843
falling into the Thaya River.

01:43.137 --> 01:45.102
A passer-by pulled her out of the water,

01:45.155 --> 01:47.166
but she is barely alive.

01:47.802 --> 01:50.840
This algorithm is on her back.

01:52.782 --> 01:54.423
Is that a tattoo?

01:54.841 --> 01:56.612
No, I've seen this before.

01:56.732 --> 01:59.458
A similar combination
of numbers and letters

01:59.468 --> 02:02.316
written in permanent marker
on the back of a kidnapped girl

02:02.322 --> 02:04.692
we recovered a few years ago in Milan.

02:05.213 --> 02:07.581
She was abducted by a
member of the Tisso gang.

02:07.611 --> 02:09.598
- As in Branick Tisso.
- Who?

02:09.610 --> 02:10.822
He's a sex-trafficker.

02:10.839 --> 02:12.418
He and his gang may be responsible

02:12.430 --> 02:14.982
for the abduction and enslavement
of more than 3,000 girls,

02:15.000 --> 02:17.647
- every year.
- Tisso threatens their families.

02:17.872 --> 02:19.475
To keep the girls under control.

02:19.659 --> 02:21.985
A few times we recovered his victims

02:21.997 --> 02:23.237
they refuse to talk.

02:23.238 --> 02:25.325
The ICC has been trying for the past

02:25.404 --> 02:29.219
six years to mount a case
against the Tisso organisation,

02:29.647 --> 02:31.606
but with, minimal headway.

02:31.624 --> 02:33.440
That area is pretty remote.

02:33.451 --> 02:35.356
Her abductors could
still be in the vicinity.

02:35.362 --> 02:39.371
And if they are, they'll probably
want her back, or silenced.

02:39.458 --> 02:41.760
- Keep me in the loop, will you, please?
- Mm-mm.

02:42.514 --> 02:44.123
Our plane leaves in an hour.

03:19.120 --> 03:21.865
_

03:24.148 --> 03:27.031
_

03:31.352 --> 03:32.554
Can I help you?

03:32.567 --> 03:35.064
Yes, Inspector Marco Costante from the ICC,

03:35.065 --> 03:37.290
we're here to see the patient, Officer...

03:37.291 --> 03:38.491
Strolz.

03:39.622 --> 03:40.933
But she's still asleep.

03:41.232 --> 03:43.253
Then perhaps, you could locate her doctor

03:43.254 --> 03:44.949
so we could discuss waking her?

03:45.442 --> 03:47.451
Thank you ever so much, Officer Strolz.

03:50.942 --> 03:52.146
So polite.

03:52.147 --> 03:54.113
Good manners never hurt anyone.

04:07.640 --> 04:10.137
I guess you don't see much
of this in a classroom.

04:12.037 --> 04:13.347
Defensive wounds.

04:13.789 --> 04:15.385
Bruising around the wrist.

04:16.420 --> 04:17.735
Deep-egde cut.

04:18.161 --> 04:20.123
And, uh, she has black soil

04:20.142 --> 04:21.476
under her fingernails.

04:21.514 --> 04:23.266
Yeah, whatever hell she was in,

04:24.048 --> 04:25.929
she clawed her way out.

04:28.290 --> 04:29.690
RETZ'S POLICE STATION, Austria

04:29.691 --> 04:31.808
She was out at night wearing only this?

04:32.597 --> 04:34.414
I don't know how she survived.

04:34.457 --> 04:36.374
There seemed to be two sources of blood.

04:36.375 --> 04:38.292
There's um... there's pooling,

04:38.304 --> 04:40.175
- and then there's...
- Yeah, you're right.

04:40.417 --> 04:43.040
That's high-velocity blood spatter.

04:43.070 --> 04:45.420
Most likely from a gunshot wound.

04:45.540 --> 04:47.518
Right next to her, at close range.

04:47.598 --> 04:49.788
That puts two other people with her.

04:49.859 --> 04:52.138
Yeah. The... the shooter,

04:52.631 --> 04:54.536
and another victim.

04:59.076 --> 05:01.807
I've been asked to give
the patient a stimulant.

05:22.594 --> 05:25.685
Hey, hey, hey. You're OK,
you're OK. You're in a hospital.

05:26.849 --> 05:28.636
She may not understand English.

05:28.649 --> 05:30.786
- Excuse me, please.
- Miss...

05:31.030 --> 05:33.091
It's OK. It will be fine.

05:37.132 --> 05:38.336
You're fine.

05:38.337 --> 05:39.549
You're fine.

05:40.188 --> 05:41.766
She can't speak.

05:42.830 --> 05:45.082
Shhh... it's OK.

05:45.392 --> 05:46.947
She can't see.

05:47.618 --> 05:49.820
Grazie Andrea, tutto bene. Ciao.

05:51.013 --> 05:54.123
The files are being sent to
Sebastian right now, from Milan.

05:54.153 --> 05:56.984
- What did the doctor say?
- CT scan, EEG,

05:56.985 --> 06:00.064
completely normal. There's nothing
wrong with her eyes, or her vocal cords.

06:00.081 --> 06:02.034
So, why is she blind and mute?

06:02.057 --> 06:03.657
It's conversion disorder.

06:03.659 --> 06:06.378
Physical symptoms present as
a result of extreme trauma.

06:06.384 --> 06:08.568
It's commonly known as
hysterical blindness.

06:08.569 --> 06:09.769
What's the prognosis?

06:09.770 --> 06:12.588
Most regain their faculties,
sometimes suddenly, but

06:12.589 --> 06:15.411
it could take days, years,
there's no way of telling.

06:15.531 --> 06:18.597
So the victim survives,
but she can't communicate.

06:18.867 --> 06:21.220
I guess we're gonna have to speak for her.

06:21.347 --> 06:22.665
What can I do?

06:22.707 --> 06:24.369
Just talk to her, Ellie.

06:24.398 --> 06:25.598
Me?

06:25.753 --> 06:26.953
Yeah.

06:27.722 --> 06:29.034
You can do it.

06:29.295 --> 06:31.384
Just keep us informed on how she is.

06:38.293 --> 06:40.793
_

06:40.837 --> 06:43.300
_

06:52.814 --> 06:54.014
Dorn.

06:54.139 --> 06:55.758
I wasn't expecting company.

06:55.978 --> 06:58.528
Well, I hope your mind
is not this cluttered.

06:58.751 --> 07:01.552
"If a cluttered desk is
a sign of a cluttered mind

07:01.605 --> 07:03.748
of what, then, is an empty desk a sign?"

07:03.813 --> 07:05.439
Mr. Einstein.

07:05.476 --> 07:06.811
Also German, of course.

07:06.879 --> 07:08.437
Famously cluttered.

07:09.229 --> 07:10.435
What can I do for you?

07:10.476 --> 07:13.955
I just wanted to make sure
that the tattoos, those

07:13.984 --> 07:16.498
algorithms, weren't giving any trouble.

07:16.720 --> 07:19.312
Well, I've compared the
number/letter combinations

07:19.313 --> 07:21.545
from our victim and Marco's case in Italy.

07:21.975 --> 07:23.365
The photo on the left,

07:23.366 --> 07:25.736
is the girl found in Milan.

07:25.751 --> 07:28.006
She was later identified
as being from Croatia.

07:28.049 --> 07:30.684
"HR" is the Croatian country code.

07:31.336 --> 07:32.540
She was...

07:32.541 --> 07:34.321
16 years old, and

07:34.441 --> 07:36.961
abducted on September 12, hence

07:37.198 --> 07:39.269
"129HR16".

07:39.311 --> 07:40.882
Using the same logic,

07:40.883 --> 07:43.096
markings on our girl found today,

07:43.566 --> 07:44.772
"113":

07:45.151 --> 07:46.391
March 11,

07:46.419 --> 07:48.114
she was abducted four days ago.

07:48.186 --> 07:49.753
- Age 17.
- Hm.

07:49.830 --> 07:51.463
And the country code, "SK".

07:51.464 --> 07:52.678
Slovakia.

07:52.882 --> 07:55.157
So, it's really more of a
cypher than al algorithm.

07:56.069 --> 07:59.355
- And the numbers at the end?
- I'm still working on those.

07:59.356 --> 08:00.556
But, uh...

08:01.296 --> 08:02.706
here's our girl.

08:04.837 --> 08:08.124
- Mm-mm.
- Yana Županová of Bratislava, Slovakia.

08:08.437 --> 08:10.063
Grew up in youth welfare.

08:10.511 --> 08:12.098
Works at the café.

08:13.038 --> 08:15.013
She was reported missing three days ago.

08:15.051 --> 08:18.997
Check and see if there are any other
missing persons in Slovakia on that date.

08:27.068 --> 08:29.546
Ema Tesarová and Margita Baníková.

08:30.173 --> 08:32.291
Both 19, flatmates.

08:33.121 --> 08:35.885
They worked at the same
café as Yana Županová .

08:36.142 --> 08:38.414
So we have two more out there.

09:10.002 --> 09:11.203
This is Felix.

09:13.541 --> 09:14.746
Go ahead.

09:14.842 --> 09:17.366
No! The pick-up will happen. You get ready!

09:17.389 --> 09:18.752
Make everything ready.

09:19.318 --> 09:21.294
Yes! One girl escaped.

09:21.308 --> 09:23.368
But we still have two that we can deliver.

09:24.523 --> 09:25.731
Don't worry.

09:25.732 --> 09:28.757
OK? I'll make sure they're at
the transfer point in time.

09:29.114 --> 09:32.182
RETZ'S POLICE STATION, Austria

09:47.531 --> 09:50.029
The sexual assault kit came back negative.

09:51.391 --> 09:53.993
Sebastian said she was
kidnapped four days ago.

09:54.173 --> 09:57.266
She was with sex traffickers for
four days, and she wasn't raped?!

09:57.283 --> 09:58.926
To the contrary, she's still a virgin.

09:59.254 --> 10:02.050
And in Tisso's trade,
a virgin girl is worth

10:02.069 --> 10:03.666
their weight in gold.

10:04.196 --> 10:06.357
That's the only reason
why they didn't touch her.

10:07.292 --> 10:09.567
I just hope the same is
true for the other two girls.

10:09.687 --> 10:11.973
Let's follow up on the blood
spatter on the nightgown.

10:12.500 --> 10:14.861
If we can figure out who
was shot next to Yana,

10:14.862 --> 10:16.335
it might lead us to the gunman.

10:26.395 --> 10:27.600
Enjoy.

10:38.715 --> 10:40.859
_

10:56.066 --> 10:57.266
Hello, Yana.

10:58.442 --> 10:59.928
It's nice to meet you.

11:02.001 --> 11:04.576
My name's Ellie Delfont-Bogard.

11:05.017 --> 11:06.643
You can call me Ellie.

11:13.041 --> 11:14.697
I'm here to help, Yana.

11:16.311 --> 11:18.577
There's nothing here you
should be frightened of.

11:19.047 --> 11:20.704
We're gonna get through this.

11:28.367 --> 11:29.567
Sebastian?

11:29.568 --> 11:32.905
I've been looking into known
associates of the Tisso gang, I, ah...

11:32.910 --> 11:35.553
cross-referenced the
names on Dorn's Tisso file,

11:35.554 --> 11:38.906
against the Strafregister
and sex offenders database...

11:39.308 --> 11:41.593
- and got a hit.
- Near Retz?

11:41.800 --> 11:44.157
Accessory to kidnapping a minor.

11:44.394 --> 11:46.834
His name's Christoph Abner, and

11:46.881 --> 11:50.009
he's 25 kilometres south of Retz,

11:50.039 --> 11:53.143
in Hollabrunn, to be exact.

12:07.113 --> 12:09.817
_

12:20.841 --> 12:22.265
Christoph Abner?

12:22.568 --> 12:24.211
We're from the ICC.

12:24.337 --> 12:27.009
We'd like to ask you a few
questions, if you don't mind.

12:27.507 --> 12:29.798
Branick Tisso went in
touch with you lately?

12:31.241 --> 12:33.971
Offering you a way to
make a little extra cash.

12:34.152 --> 12:35.829
Traffic a few girls.

12:37.182 --> 12:38.671
I stopped all that

12:38.980 --> 12:40.482
years ago.

12:42.677 --> 12:43.941
Nice Pony.

12:44.061 --> 12:46.795
You afford all this on a caretaker salary?

12:48.831 --> 12:51.115
I rebuilt it from nothing.

12:51.486 --> 12:53.360
For next to nothing.

12:54.001 --> 12:55.574
It's taken me years.

12:56.078 --> 12:58.808
- Anything else?
- Can I look around?

12:59.776 --> 13:01.687
We've been closed for months.

13:02.271 --> 13:04.026
There's nothing to see.

13:05.888 --> 13:07.093
OK.

13:07.403 --> 13:08.655
We'll be in touch.

13:12.352 --> 13:14.548
- Pony?
- Mustang. He's lying.

13:14.549 --> 13:17.284
Maybe not about Tisso, but about something.

13:17.349 --> 13:19.192
Those parts were all factory new.

13:19.193 --> 13:21.841
Ah, that custom steering wheel
alone would go for two grand.

13:21.870 --> 13:24.577
Well, where there is a little
lie, there is a big lie.

13:24.578 --> 13:25.802
We'll keep an eye on him.

13:25.803 --> 13:28.076
I didn't know you were
such a motor-head, boss.

13:28.980 --> 13:31.603
There's a lot you don't
know about me, Inspector.

13:58.540 --> 13:59.905
Jesus.

14:00.091 --> 14:01.496
What a drop.

14:04.238 --> 14:07.344
It's gonna be difficult to find those
other girls in a terrain like this.

14:08.155 --> 14:10.414
I assume she followed the tracks.

14:12.232 --> 14:14.636
Witness said she came from this direction.

14:27.686 --> 14:29.292
- Look here.
- What is it?

14:32.045 --> 14:33.245
Blood.

14:45.011 --> 14:47.147
I found this on your Facebook page.

14:47.991 --> 14:50.329
You and your friends, Margita and Ema.

15:13.570 --> 15:15.654
I've been learning about you.

15:16.924 --> 15:19.422
Growing up in a home must
have been really difficult.

15:20.211 --> 15:21.411
But you know,

15:21.713 --> 15:25.072
sometimes, difficult
things make us stronger.

15:26.413 --> 15:29.677
The best detectives in
Europe are out there, Yana,

15:29.725 --> 15:31.137
finding your friends.

15:32.086 --> 15:34.382
You didn't give up, and neither will they.

15:40.234 --> 15:41.486
Hello, Yana.

15:41.973 --> 15:43.492
Nice to have you back.

15:47.771 --> 15:48.971
Yana?

15:50.170 --> 15:51.589
Yana, hello?

16:08.349 --> 16:10.961
Walking this far in zero degrees.

16:10.967 --> 16:13.234
She would have been hypothermic
in no time at all.

16:13.264 --> 16:16.487
She's wandering, in the
dark, she's disorientated.

16:16.607 --> 16:19.206
Maybe she already lost
her vision as well.

16:21.229 --> 16:23.217
Some deep tyre tracks here.

16:31.905 --> 16:33.134
Luke.

16:34.030 --> 16:35.834
Someone's jumped from that window.

16:39.260 --> 16:40.686
I'll check 'round the back.

17:30.715 --> 17:31.915
Clear.

17:32.227 --> 17:33.427
Clear.

17:40.435 --> 17:41.848
Found this by the front door.

17:41.860 --> 17:43.640
Addressed to Noah and

17:44.358 --> 17:45.986
Agetta Lang.

17:47.160 --> 17:50.246
Dating about six weeks ago,
so it must be junk mail.

17:50.247 --> 17:51.856
Looks like a holiday home.

17:54.614 --> 17:56.780
This must be where she escaped.

17:58.477 --> 18:00.702
Yeah, but what was she escaping from?

18:04.067 --> 18:05.409
What's that?

18:14.602 --> 18:16.031
Looks like blood.

18:16.239 --> 18:19.474
- Smells like bleach.
- Well, bleach'll have compromise the DNA.

18:19.705 --> 18:22.008
Make it difficult to identify the victim.

18:22.026 --> 18:23.509
Unless,

18:24.389 --> 18:27.493
we can find a pure sample here somewhere.

18:30.618 --> 18:32.599
Should see what this
things picks up in the hotels

18:32.600 --> 18:34.294
the MET puts us up in.

18:35.013 --> 18:36.532
Word to the wise,

18:36.562 --> 18:38.509
never use a hotel duvet.

18:38.650 --> 18:39.850
Wow.

18:40.075 --> 18:41.304
Thanks for that.

18:46.216 --> 18:47.422
Blood.

18:48.823 --> 18:50.182
And lots of it.

18:50.302 --> 18:53.640
I think we can safely assume,
this is our primary crime scene.

18:56.105 --> 18:59.233
Looks like the housekeeper
wasn't so thorough after all.

19:00.783 --> 19:02.733
It's high-velocity blood splatter.

19:02.961 --> 19:04.754
Just like on the night dress.

19:22.255 --> 19:24.237
- Was zum Teufel?
- Jesus.

19:24.823 --> 19:26.029
What are you doing here?

19:26.030 --> 19:28.725
An alarm came through at the
station, that there was a break-in.

19:28.755 --> 19:29.965
Wait, there's an alarm?

19:30.007 --> 19:33.973
- Silent alarm notifies the station.
- And did this alarm go off last night?

19:34.149 --> 19:36.417
- No.
- This is where our victim was brought.

19:36.447 --> 19:39.587
We need you to call the owners and find
out who else had the security code.

19:39.707 --> 19:40.946
Whoever was here

19:40.957 --> 19:43.153
knew how to reset the alarm when they left.

19:43.154 --> 19:46.216
And let's see if we can get any
usable fingerprints from the keypad.

19:46.657 --> 19:48.091
Yes, ma'am.

19:48.858 --> 19:50.668
According to foot and tyre tracks,

19:50.686 --> 19:52.810
the shooter may have headed north-west,

19:52.839 --> 19:54.450
possibly with a body in his vehicle.

19:54.451 --> 19:56.477
We need to widen the search
for the missing girls.

19:56.478 --> 19:58.259
And there could be another dead body.

19:58.260 --> 20:00.907
There are thousands hectares
of forest in that direction.

20:00.908 --> 20:03.019
Well, then we're going to
need a bigger search party.

20:08.117 --> 20:10.136
I know you can hear me, Yana.

20:11.090 --> 20:12.918
And we all know how strong you are.

20:13.564 --> 20:15.422
Yana, I need you to be strong.

20:15.665 --> 20:17.309
For Margita and Ema.

20:19.351 --> 20:21.914
I'm going to tap your hand, OK?

20:22.425 --> 20:24.888
If you can understand me, tap back.

20:32.270 --> 20:33.470
OK.

20:34.502 --> 20:35.748
Maybe we should stop.

20:36.063 --> 20:39.808
You're probably sick of the
sound of my voice. I know I am.

20:42.171 --> 20:44.766
Sebastian, tell us something good.

20:44.907 --> 20:47.756
The blood on the night
dress has two contributors.

20:47.780 --> 20:49.661
One is our Yana Županová ,

20:49.881 --> 20:51.149
the other, an unknown male.

20:51.150 --> 20:53.537
Then it wasn't one of the
other girls who was hurt.

20:53.543 --> 20:57.288
The male blood has a distinctive
marker for an aggressive bone cancer

20:57.306 --> 20:59.033
called leiomyosarcoma.

20:59.045 --> 21:01.632
I found the match at the
hospital in Marbella, Spain.

21:01.650 --> 21:02.960
Is there an I.D.?

21:02.961 --> 21:06.854
Due to patient confidentiality, there is
no name, just an identification number.

21:07.555 --> 21:08.759
I, er...

21:09.388 --> 21:11.177
- could hack in...
- No!

21:11.442 --> 21:14.261
Thank you, Sebastian. Let's
keep it clean. I'm on it.

21:18.860 --> 21:20.180
Arabela?

21:20.421 --> 21:21.887
I need you in the air.

21:31.600 --> 21:33.161
***, Ema.

21:40.925 --> 21:42.125
Ema.

21:43.780 --> 21:45.382
Ema, ***.

22:02.685 --> 22:05.525
The hospital confirmed the
blood found in the cottage

22:05.526 --> 22:07.434
belonged to Alonso Caro.

22:07.856 --> 22:10.275
He's been given less than a month to live.

22:10.960 --> 22:13.429
He's a philanthropist
and a social activist,

22:13.453 --> 22:16.450
last seen two days ago at
a fund-raiser in Vienna.

22:16.646 --> 22:18.806
That's only a few hours from here.

22:19.061 --> 22:20.880
Caro didn't have a next of kin,

22:20.881 --> 22:23.353
but he had a long-term personal assistant.

22:23.364 --> 22:24.966
I'm on my way to see her now.

22:24.978 --> 22:27.168
Good work. Thank you, Arabela.

22:42.802 --> 22:44.126
What have you found?

22:44.315 --> 22:46.071
Huh? What have you found?

23:06.597 --> 23:08.860
_

23:08.891 --> 23:11.173
_

23:19.108 --> 23:21.793
- You read Polish, Berger?
- I, uh...

23:21.794 --> 23:23.753
just wanted to make sure
you heard about the body

23:23.754 --> 23:25.815
they found in the woods, Alonso Caro.

23:25.816 --> 23:27.016
I did.

23:27.123 --> 23:28.380
I met him,

23:29.436 --> 23:30.718
just once.

23:31.454 --> 23:34.273
Alonso Caro was a one-man army,

23:34.274 --> 23:35.651
in the fight against

23:36.071 --> 23:37.496
human trafficking.

23:39.338 --> 23:40.731
Great loss.

23:47.264 --> 23:49.852
- There's something else?
- Yes, actually, there...

23:50.066 --> 23:51.716
is something else.

23:52.416 --> 23:55.793
I was part of this unit for two
years. You asked me back, so...

23:56.054 --> 23:58.137
why does it feel like
I'm on probation again?

23:58.309 --> 24:00.541
It's a new team. New players.

24:00.868 --> 24:03.788
- New rules.
- I play by the rules.

24:03.805 --> 24:06.026
Mm. Continue on that course.

24:09.093 --> 24:11.134
Oh, uh, by the way,

24:11.135 --> 24:12.372
in the code,

24:12.384 --> 24:14.579
the last letter "J" stands for "jungfrau".

24:14.699 --> 24:16.266
German for "virgin".

24:16.895 --> 24:18.298
Virgin.

24:19.319 --> 24:21.604
We have to catch that son of a bitch.

24:22.620 --> 24:24.707
_

24:25.239 --> 24:27.214
_

24:28.153 --> 24:31.429
I worked alongside him for almost a decade.

24:32.420 --> 24:33.792
Everyday.

24:34.895 --> 24:37.412
When was the last time
you spoke to Mr. Caro?

24:38.406 --> 24:40.431
He rang me two nights ago.

24:40.438 --> 24:42.752
He had an enthusiasm in his voice

24:42.760 --> 24:45.346
I hadn't heard since his diagnosis.

24:45.347 --> 24:47.281
I assume you knew

24:47.432 --> 24:49.316
what he was doing in Retz.

24:49.317 --> 24:52.046
He told me less than he usually does.

24:52.580 --> 24:57.508
He said he was meeting someone at
the corporate retreat. That's it.

24:57.587 --> 24:59.998
Did he mention if he had anything to do

25:00.013 --> 25:02.441
with a man called Branick Tisso?

25:03.289 --> 25:04.918
I don't know.

25:05.200 --> 25:08.025
I think I would recall if
he had mentioned that name.

25:12.431 --> 25:14.746
Hey, Sebastian, did you
find anything on our victim?

25:14.776 --> 25:17.067
Caro made a bank transfer
yesterday in Retz.

25:17.217 --> 25:19.680
100,000 Euros to an account in the Caymans.

25:19.686 --> 25:21.879
Are you able to identify
the owner of the account?

25:21.880 --> 25:22.768
Not legally.

25:22.769 --> 25:24.719
Caymans privacy laws are extremely strict.

25:24.749 --> 25:27.444
Caro's a billionaire,
busy guy, d-doesn't he have

25:27.468 --> 25:29.958
people to run his banking errands for him?

25:30.465 --> 25:33.130
Clearly it was a transaction
he wanted kept secret.

25:33.927 --> 25:35.127
Thank you.

25:36.062 --> 25:38.436
Arabela, any news from Spain?

25:38.453 --> 25:41.693
Alonso Caro's assistant
knew he was in Retz.

25:41.770 --> 25:43.414
She didn't know who he was meeting there,

25:43.415 --> 25:45.641
but given his crusade
against sex trafficking

25:45.666 --> 25:48.481
it would be too coincidental
for it not to be about Tisso.

25:48.482 --> 25:50.138
Right. Anything else?

25:50.419 --> 25:52.478
She gave the address of
where he was staying.

25:52.479 --> 25:53.987
Text me the address.

25:54.065 --> 25:56.253
Call Luke, tell him to meet us there.

26:21.239 --> 26:23.023
Carine Strand, with the ICC.

26:23.024 --> 26:25.253
We're here about a member
of yours, Alonso Caro.

26:25.254 --> 26:26.794
Oh, yes, good afternoon.

26:26.842 --> 26:29.387
We all welcome you at the Bachelor Sin Club.

26:29.448 --> 26:30.650
What club?

26:30.879 --> 26:32.083
Bachelor Sin.

26:32.084 --> 26:35.194
Oh, it means a little castle in the forest.

26:35.217 --> 26:37.692
Of course, to us it means so much more.

26:38.232 --> 26:40.560
Mr. Caro was staying here?

26:40.875 --> 26:44.214
- Corporate retreat.
- We're obviously in the wrong job.

26:45.416 --> 26:49.308
Mr. Caro's assistant said
that he was staying here, yes?

26:49.466 --> 26:52.397
And his body was found
six kilometres from here.

26:52.864 --> 26:55.238
Oh, that's shocking news, really.

26:55.290 --> 26:58.295
We'll need to speak with anyone
here that he may have, uh...

26:58.510 --> 27:00.019
interacted with.

27:00.047 --> 27:01.930
Mr. Caro is a new member, but

27:01.931 --> 27:04.971
we never had the pleasure of meeting
him. He didn't check in last night.

27:05.287 --> 27:06.769
Please, do follow us.

27:22.894 --> 27:25.368
We're gonna need to check your CCTV.

27:25.369 --> 27:26.888
Oh, there is none.

27:26.912 --> 27:29.093
All security cameras are deactivated

27:29.094 --> 27:31.220
for the duration of the retreat.

27:31.221 --> 27:33.961
To protect the reputations of our members.

27:33.962 --> 27:37.218
So we cannot confirm that
he wasn't here last night.

27:37.435 --> 27:38.824
You have my word.

27:39.669 --> 27:40.869
In addition,

27:40.870 --> 27:43.458
I assure you this business
is a lawful operation.

27:43.459 --> 27:46.095
It exists only for pleasure and recreation.

27:46.913 --> 27:50.291
Everyone here in our club is
here by their own free will.

27:50.411 --> 27:52.149
We abide by Austrian law.

27:52.167 --> 27:55.199
And we conduct background checks
on staff and members alike.

27:55.200 --> 27:56.928
We'd like to see those records.

27:57.472 --> 28:00.869
Unfortunately, I cannot
oblige without a warrant.

28:00.870 --> 28:02.070
Legalities.

28:02.071 --> 28:05.029
While you worry about legalities,
there are two missing girls out there

28:05.030 --> 28:07.158
whose lives are in danger, right now!

28:07.380 --> 28:09.130
Yes, I'm very sorry about that.

28:09.331 --> 28:10.898
But our hands are tied.

28:43.046 --> 28:44.246
Yana?

28:44.482 --> 28:45.682
I'm here.

28:55.139 --> 28:56.339
Good girl.

29:16.673 --> 29:17.873
Ema?

29:18.151 --> 29:19.351
Ema?

29:28.024 --> 29:29.224
Yana,

29:29.225 --> 29:31.688
were there two or more men
in the cottage with you?

29:31.711 --> 29:33.415
One for yes, two for no.

29:33.984 --> 29:35.978
Yana, two or more men?

29:36.458 --> 29:37.752
Do you remember?

29:37.954 --> 29:39.646
One for yes, two for no.

29:41.931 --> 29:45.219
OK. Do you know a man named Alonso Caro.

29:45.575 --> 29:48.899
Does the name Alonso Caro
mean anything to you, Yana?

29:51.267 --> 29:53.994
Do you remember the names
of the man you were with?

29:55.391 --> 29:58.004
Yana, you're doing really well, OK?

29:58.317 --> 30:01.657
Now, Margita and Ema, are they
being kept near the cottage?

30:02.798 --> 30:04.525
Officer, can I speak with you?

30:04.594 --> 30:05.794
Of course.

30:06.383 --> 30:09.425
I'm still waiting to hear back
from the owners of the cottage.

30:09.426 --> 30:12.953
What do you know of the activity
up at the Waldschlösschen Club?

30:13.282 --> 30:15.686
You mean the bonga-bonga parties?

30:16.384 --> 30:18.640
I've only heard rumours.

30:18.670 --> 30:21.861
Have you heard of any complaints
or reports against the club?

30:21.862 --> 30:23.062
No.

30:23.203 --> 30:26.640
And I can't imagine the guests
have any complaints either.

30:29.200 --> 30:30.400
Yana.

30:30.593 --> 30:31.936
Yana, are you OK?

30:32.113 --> 30:33.601
Oh my god. I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

31:12.763 --> 31:15.006
***

31:15.042 --> 31:18.591
***

31:19.084 --> 31:20.284
Shut up!

31:22.491 --> 31:23.691
Shut up!

31:27.397 --> 31:28.597
Damn it!

31:28.639 --> 31:30.350
Get up! Come here!

31:30.574 --> 31:32.425
OK, let's go, it's time!

31:32.461 --> 31:34.226
Let's go. Go!

31:44.033 --> 31:45.802
You need to get these people outta here.

31:45.825 --> 31:47.743
Come on, people. Party's over!

31:47.766 --> 31:49.137
Let's get dressed!

31:49.184 --> 31:52.976
We have a warrant to search
this place from top to bottom.

31:56.366 --> 32:00.209
If this place is a front, it's the
most legit front I've ever seen.

32:00.966 --> 32:03.251
50,000 Euros per year.

32:03.774 --> 32:06.094
That's what a membership
to this club will cost you.

32:06.409 --> 32:07.845
It's outrageous!

32:07.875 --> 32:10.034
Were you thinking on
filling out an application?

32:10.422 --> 32:12.559
Come on. Don't need to pay for it!

32:14.670 --> 32:15.928
Here he is.

32:17.223 --> 32:18.946
Alonso Caro.

32:19.667 --> 32:22.684
Good-looking, loaded, pillar of society.

32:23.947 --> 32:26.416
Look, he only joined the club last month.

32:26.979 --> 32:28.416
He was dying,

32:28.736 --> 32:30.367
he wanted to sow some wild oats...

32:30.368 --> 32:32.837
I get it. What I can't seem to reconcile

32:33.034 --> 32:36.132
is how he ended up in that
cottage with Yana. It's...

32:37.976 --> 32:39.211
Hold on a minute.

32:39.212 --> 32:40.442
What is it?

32:42.630 --> 32:44.676
Tha'ts Raphael Strolz.

32:44.966 --> 32:47.821
He was moonlighting as
private security at the club.

32:48.076 --> 32:49.993
He said he'd never been there.

32:50.189 --> 32:51.515
He lied to me.

32:52.497 --> 32:54.966
Let's have a chat with Officer Strolz.

33:34.773 --> 33:36.399
- OK?
- OK.

34:18.216 --> 34:19.681
Looks like a cell.

34:21.838 --> 34:23.831
Big enough to hold two girls.

34:29.451 --> 34:30.745
Strolz!

34:32.378 --> 34:33.636
Freeze!

34:37.268 --> 34:38.469
Stop!

35:33.690 --> 35:34.890
Sorry.

35:35.039 --> 35:36.337
Should I have knocked?

35:41.151 --> 35:43.934
Just tell us where are the other girls.

35:44.054 --> 35:46.193
I don't know. I swear it.

35:47.514 --> 35:49.443
It was just for a couple of days.

35:49.466 --> 35:51.112
Then they went over the border.

35:51.793 --> 35:53.562
It was just a one-time thing.

35:53.682 --> 35:55.426
Just "one-time thing"?

35:55.462 --> 35:58.647
That backyard prison of yours
looks pretty broken-in to me!

36:05.693 --> 36:07.895
When we run a DNA tests

36:08.348 --> 36:10.477
what are we gonna find, Strolz?

36:11.284 --> 36:13.658
How many girls were locked up there?

36:16.501 --> 36:17.869
Wow...

36:18.966 --> 36:20.349
that many?

36:20.739 --> 36:22.335
I needed the money.

36:23.486 --> 36:25.938
When I wanted out, they wouldn't let me.

36:26.469 --> 36:28.107
If you want me to talk,

36:28.477 --> 36:30.329
I need you to promise me protection.

36:30.364 --> 36:33.130
Protection from who, exactly? Huh?

36:33.173 --> 36:34.648
Branick Tisso.

36:35.891 --> 36:37.369
He's watching me.

36:37.489 --> 36:39.719
He'll kill me with his bare hands.

36:39.730 --> 36:42.330
Branick Tisso is a big fish.

36:42.383 --> 36:44.925
What would he want with
a little nobody like you?

36:45.156 --> 36:46.715
That's why he's so dangerous.

36:47.529 --> 36:49.553
He never leaves anything to chance.

36:49.716 --> 36:50.918
So what?

36:51.061 --> 36:53.833
- You've seen him?
- Yes, I have.

36:58.136 --> 37:00.168
OK, we can give you the protection.

37:00.889 --> 37:03.768
But you have to give me a description, OK?

37:05.779 --> 37:07.446
I see him everywhere.

37:10.595 --> 37:12.886
His real name is Felix.

37:26.300 --> 37:28.523
We know you work for the club.

37:29.428 --> 37:31.513
Is that... is that the transfer point?

37:31.939 --> 37:34.746
They move the girls in horse carriers,

37:35.019 --> 37:36.940
through the mansion stables.

37:39.500 --> 37:41.945
Some club members, like Caro,

37:42.954 --> 37:44.367
they want something...

37:44.930 --> 37:46.343
extra pure,

37:46.640 --> 37:48.088
at a premium.

37:55.601 --> 37:56.901
Yana?

37:56.902 --> 37:58.246
I have good news.

37:58.591 --> 38:01.327
The detectives have arrested
one of the men that hurt you,

38:01.328 --> 38:03.210
and he says your friends are still alive.

38:03.342 --> 38:05.236
They're being transferred tonight,

38:05.253 --> 38:07.372
and we're going to be there to save them.

38:08.095 --> 38:09.413
It's over.

38:34.905 --> 38:36.336
He's late!

38:37.233 --> 38:38.639
He'll be here.

38:56.692 --> 38:58.178
Listen, Raphy, I'm...

38:58.804 --> 39:00.763
I'm sorry to have to do this.

39:03.303 --> 39:04.834
I don't believe them.

39:08.778 --> 39:11.284
I'll be right down the
hall if you need anything.

39:30.848 --> 39:32.349
Keep your eyes open.

39:46.018 --> 39:47.377
You wait here!

39:47.884 --> 39:49.369
Come on! Come on!

39:52.100 --> 39:55.294
- Go, go. Come on, come on girls!
- No! No!

39:55.323 --> 39:56.873
Come on! We're late!

39:56.874 --> 39:58.102
- No!
- Hurry up!

39:58.125 --> 40:00.300
- Bring them here. Come on!
- Take 'em.

40:01.064 --> 40:02.264
Quickly!

40:13.200 --> 40:14.912
Step away from the girls!

40:15.634 --> 40:17.694
Fuck! Shut up!

40:25.606 --> 40:27.339
Back off! Back off!

40:27.351 --> 40:28.926
Or I'll fucking shoot her!

40:29.039 --> 40:30.416
Drop the gun.

40:32.887 --> 40:34.376
It's over, Felix.

40:34.581 --> 40:36.948
Just put the gun down, OK?

40:38.397 --> 40:39.929
Back off!

40:41.193 --> 40:43.685
Don't move. Put your hands back!

40:45.903 --> 40:47.249
It's over.

40:48.246 --> 40:49.446
No!

41:01.129 --> 41:02.395
Manz?

41:03.896 --> 41:05.530
I know you're in here.

41:10.535 --> 41:12.886
You're under arrest, asshole.

41:12.923 --> 41:15.557
Stay where you are, or
I'll fucking kill her!

41:17.330 --> 41:18.733
Ready, Marco?

41:18.888 --> 41:20.760
I'm lined up, just say the word.

41:23.718 --> 41:25.504
He's a good shot.

41:29.252 --> 41:30.452
Wait, stop!

41:43.364 --> 41:44.610
Raphy?

41:45.923 --> 41:47.248
Eat something.

41:50.567 --> 41:52.066
Help me, Lorenz.

41:52.787 --> 41:55.658
Help me, I'm sick.

41:58.507 --> 42:01.126
Okay, Manz. Party's over. Let's talk.

42:01.156 --> 42:03.947
How did Caro end up in
that cottage with Yana?

42:04.220 --> 42:07.462
Caro declared war on
Tisso, that never ends well.

42:07.684 --> 42:09.621
For what it's worth, I
didn't arrange any of it.

42:09.622 --> 42:10.900
Arrange what?

42:10.935 --> 42:13.216
- Caro's assassination?
- Now, look,

42:14.308 --> 42:16.400
the club's drivers make the deals,

42:16.415 --> 42:17.684
Caro was offered a virgin.

42:17.699 --> 42:21.166
He thought he could buy her
freedom, idealistic fool that he was.

42:21.949 --> 42:24.820
Tisso set him up. Had I
known, I would have stopped it!

42:24.843 --> 42:27.477
So tell us everything you
can about Tisso's organisation

42:27.492 --> 42:30.311
- and maybe the ICC will go easy on you.
- All right, I do that

42:30.318 --> 42:32.944
and Tisso will make sure I
never live to see The Hague.

42:32.973 --> 42:35.919
He's cuffed to an hospital
bed. He's not going anywhere.

42:35.941 --> 42:37.543
What? Who? Felix?

42:37.566 --> 42:39.064
That moronic henchman?

42:39.094 --> 42:42.735
Why do I care that Felix got shot
when Branick Tisso is still out there?

42:48.279 --> 42:51.907
Luke, I can't raise anyone at the
police station. It's Strolz.

42:51.959 --> 42:53.992
Strolz is Branick Tisso.

43:23.325 --> 43:26.673
- Let him go, Tisso.
- Off him, step back!

43:26.857 --> 43:29.965
Move up against the
wall. Hands on the wall!

43:31.730 --> 43:33.231
We know who you are.

43:36.041 --> 43:37.755
- Is he OK?
- Yeah.

43:44.996 --> 43:46.287
Yes.

43:47.175 --> 43:49.126
Athena you're not wearing your aegis,

43:49.127 --> 43:52.213
you should have the head of
Branick Tisso hanging from it.

43:52.299 --> 43:53.630
Him in custody.

43:54.182 --> 43:56.406
I could not have asked for more.

43:56.407 --> 43:59.460
He was right in front of me.
Dorn, I almost let him go;

43:59.839 --> 44:01.688
But it was your work,

44:01.776 --> 44:05.256
that created the condition
that allowed for success.

44:05.376 --> 44:06.705
I'm thrilled

44:07.044 --> 44:08.561
and so should you be.

44:09.114 --> 44:11.443
Go, walk on air for a while.

44:11.563 --> 44:13.124
Be triumphant.

44:23.963 --> 44:25.316
Here she is.
