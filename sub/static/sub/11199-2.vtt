00:01.915 --> 00:04.042
<i>Previously on</i> Stargate SG-1.

00:04.117 --> 00:06.813
<i>The city we've been looking for</i>
<i>is under the ice of Antarctica.</i>

00:06.887 --> 00:08.650
Good-bye.

00:11.024 --> 00:14.323
- What about Colonel O'Neill?
- The Asgard can help him.

00:16.563 --> 00:18.656
A Gou'ald wants to arrange
a treaty with us.

00:18.732 --> 00:22.099
Not just one Gou'ald.
All of them. The system lords.

00:22.169 --> 00:24.364
<i>The hull has been breached.</i>

00:24.438 --> 00:26.872
The projectile was likely
composed of Replicators.

00:30.777 --> 00:34.213
- Major Carter was beamed away.
- The Replicators must have her.

00:34.281 --> 00:37.045
You gained my trust.
Then you used me and left me behind.

00:37.117 --> 00:39.483
I'm sorry for what we did to you.

00:39.553 --> 00:42.113
If the human-form Replicators
reach Orilla...

00:42.189 --> 00:45.215
they will have the resources
to replicate many thousands of times.

00:45.292 --> 00:48.056
- We cannot allow that to happen.
- So be it.

00:53.400 --> 00:57.393
- <i>The enemy ship has been destroyed.</i>
- I am sorry, Teal'c.

00:59.773 --> 01:02.333
We're not about to fight your battles
for you in exchange for...

01:02.409 --> 01:05.845
a couple of hyperdrive engines that may
or may not do us any good in the long run.

01:05.912 --> 01:08.710
- Shut it down.
- What is the meaning of this?

01:08.782 --> 01:11.444
They're sending a ship to attack Earth.
It'll be here within the hour.

01:16.723 --> 01:19.817
We are political dignitaries.
How dare you prevent us from leaving?

01:19.893 --> 01:22.361
Sending ships here to attack us
is an act of war...

01:22.429 --> 01:25.728
and a foolish one at that,
given what our defenses are capable of.

01:25.799 --> 01:27.596
My lord did not order such action.

01:27.667 --> 01:30.761
Then undo it. Tell the system lords
to call the ship back.

01:30.837 --> 01:33.601
The decision they have made
is one of desperation...

01:33.673 --> 01:36.506
forced upon them
by your unwillingness to help.

01:36.576 --> 01:39.306
Persuading them to change course
could only be done in person.

01:39.379 --> 01:41.279
With a full council vote.

01:41.348 --> 01:43.339
Even if I did believe you...

01:43.417 --> 01:46.580
all good faith is out the window
at this point.

01:46.653 --> 01:49.952
You're our prisoners.
Take them away.

03:09.302 --> 03:12.396
- <i>Greetings, Thor.</i>
- Greetings.

03:12.472 --> 03:15.805
Teal'c, this is Penegal
of the Asgard High Council.

03:17.544 --> 03:20.570
<i>I regret to report that the debris</i>
<i>from the destroyed Replicator ship...</i>

03:20.647 --> 03:22.581
<i>could not be contained.</i>

03:23.416 --> 03:25.646
<i>We were unable to prevent</i>
<i>countless Replicator blocks...</i>

03:25.719 --> 03:27.653
<i>from raining down on Orilla.</i>

03:29.656 --> 03:32.921
<i>They have already begun replicating</i>
<i>and infesting our systems.</i>

03:34.494 --> 03:36.519
<i>Control of the city is in jeopardy.</i>

03:36.596 --> 03:38.894
Should you not consider
evacuating your people?

03:39.733 --> 03:41.826
<i>That is no longer possible.</i>

03:41.902 --> 03:44.200
There are too many.

03:44.271 --> 03:47.672
We carried numerous stored minds
aboard the computers of our ships...

03:47.741 --> 03:49.675
when we fled our home world.

03:49.743 --> 03:51.608
When Orilla was finally found...

03:51.678 --> 03:54.738
we were able to place those minds
into cloned bodies...

03:54.814 --> 03:57.248
so that we could build our new colony.

03:57.317 --> 04:02.687
<i>The Replicators have already infected</i>
<i>systems needed to save those minds.</i>

04:02.756 --> 04:07.022
<i>If we lose this battle, they will perish</i>
<i>along with their bodies...</i>

04:07.093 --> 04:10.392
<i>taking with them the hopes</i>
<i>of the Asgard race.</i>

04:10.463 --> 04:14.399
Orilla is the last chance
of ever rebuilding our empire.

04:14.467 --> 04:17.300
Then we must find a way to save it.

04:30.083 --> 04:32.574
Sir, sensors have detected
an alien vessel.

04:32.652 --> 04:36.952
It exited hyperspace 14,000 kilometers
out, eight degrees starboard.

04:37.023 --> 04:38.957
- Designation?
- None yet, sir.

04:39.025 --> 04:42.586
Vessel is the size of a Goa'uld
mother ship. Closing fast.

04:42.662 --> 04:45.825
- Visual range in six seconds.
- Hold your position. Prepare to fire.

04:45.899 --> 04:50.063
- Four, three, two, one.
- On screen, maximum magnification.

04:53.373 --> 04:56.604
Open a channel, broadcast on all
frequencies and translate into Goa'uld.

04:56.676 --> 04:58.166
Yes, sir.

05:03.216 --> 05:06.811
This is Colonel Lionel Pendergast of
the United States Air Force <i>Prometheus.</i>

05:08.154 --> 05:10.088
Unidentified vessel...

05:10.156 --> 05:12.647
failure to reply will constitute
an act of aggression...

05:12.726 --> 05:15.024
and we will respond with
the full force of our weapons.

05:16.763 --> 05:18.594
That will be unnecessary.

05:20.166 --> 05:24.068
<i>I offer greetings from Thor, the Supreme</i>
<i>Commander of the Asgard Fleet.</i>

05:24.137 --> 05:26.298
<i>We are aboard the</i> DanielJackson.

05:29.042 --> 05:32.307
I have just received word
that the Asgard have arrived.

05:32.379 --> 05:35.371
They want to witness the demonstration
of our new Ancient defense technology...

05:35.448 --> 05:37.439
that you've forced us into.

05:38.785 --> 05:41.117
There's still time to call off the attack.

05:41.187 --> 05:44.645
We would also like to witness
the demonstration.

05:45.625 --> 05:48.890
Your ship isn't coming.
It was destroyed en route by Ba'al.

05:50.130 --> 05:53.463
The collective forces of the system lords
are bowing, and you're losing the war.

05:54.801 --> 05:56.291
Then so are you.

06:10.150 --> 06:13.415
- Hey, guys.
- Our new colony is in grave jeopardy.

06:14.487 --> 06:17.684
The Replicators escaped
from the time-dilation device...

06:17.757 --> 06:20.351
and are threatening
to destroy the Asgard.

06:20.427 --> 06:23.362
Okay. So what can we do?

06:23.430 --> 06:25.990
Thor believes the Ancient knowledge
stored in O'Neill's mind...

06:26.066 --> 06:28.762
may be the key to defeating
the Replicators once and for all.

06:28.835 --> 06:31.099
Jack's frozen down in Antarc...

06:35.041 --> 06:36.531
tica.

06:43.750 --> 06:46.048
As I was saying, where's Sam?

06:46.119 --> 06:50.385
She was captured by the Replicators.
Their ship was destroyed.

08:09.269 --> 08:12.534
Hey, sleepyhead.
I didn't think you'd ever get up.

08:13.807 --> 08:15.638
It was kind of a long night, huh?

08:17.610 --> 08:19.100
Pete.

08:22.282 --> 08:25.012
What's up? You okay?
Is something wrong?

08:25.084 --> 08:28.383
- Yes, everything.
- What do you mean?

08:28.454 --> 08:31.355
This. What are you doing here?

08:32.826 --> 08:34.953
What am I doing here?
Where the hell is here?

08:38.598 --> 08:40.896
That was good. You had me.
You really had me.

08:40.967 --> 08:43.561
Of course, I've been up since 5:00
feeding the pigs and the chickens.

08:43.636 --> 08:46.503
No, Pete, honestly, I don't-

08:46.573 --> 08:49.064
What? You don't what?

08:50.877 --> 08:53.243
Think this is real.

08:54.347 --> 08:57.874
You hungry? I'm starving. We'll go inside,
I'll whip you up some pancakes.

08:57.951 --> 09:00.385
You don't understand.

09:01.454 --> 09:03.354
This isn't happening.

09:05.892 --> 09:08.383
The last thing I remember,
I was on board a Replicator ship.

09:10.496 --> 09:13.761
This is just another way
of screwing with my mind.

09:13.833 --> 09:16.097
Okay, here's what I know.

09:16.169 --> 09:19.161
This is not SGC. It's Montana.

09:19.239 --> 09:23.039
Nothing weird happens here,
not like you're used to.

09:23.109 --> 09:26.272
Ayear ago, you left the Stargate program
because of mental stress...

09:26.346 --> 09:30.749
and because you wanted to be with me
and a farm full of really stinky animals.

09:30.817 --> 09:34.412
You've been seeing a shrink because you
can't seem to shake the nightmares.

09:35.488 --> 09:37.979
You've had a bad one, okay?

09:41.628 --> 09:43.220
That's it.

09:58.444 --> 10:01.902
- Did that feel real?
- Yes.

10:01.981 --> 10:03.972
Then snap out of it.

10:07.186 --> 10:10.087
Okay, pancakes?
Or do I have to call the doctor?

10:12.759 --> 10:16.752
- I am kind of hungry.
- Good. Come on.

10:27.307 --> 10:29.298
What are you going to do?

10:29.375 --> 10:32.776
I am going to merge O'Neill's mind
with the ship's computer.

10:34.447 --> 10:36.745
To do that, you're gonna have to
defrost him first, right?

10:36.816 --> 10:39.182
I bring this up because he was
near death when we froze him.

10:39.252 --> 10:41.777
Hopefully, the pod will sustain his life.

10:43.923 --> 10:47.188
- Hopefully?
- What other choice do we have?

10:47.260 --> 10:49.251
Can't you just save him,
like the last time this happened?

10:49.329 --> 10:51.388
Just wipe the Ancient knowledge
from his mind.

10:51.464 --> 10:55.867
And lose any chance of learning
a means to defeat the Replicators.

10:56.936 --> 10:59.928
You have no right to risk his life.

11:00.006 --> 11:02.099
I believe O'Neill would approve.

11:02.175 --> 11:04.905
We can't make that choice for him,
no matter what's at stake.

11:04.978 --> 11:07.446
Can't you just extract the Ancient
information into the ship's computer?

11:07.513 --> 11:10.448
Then we can all benefit from it, maybe learn
how to use the Ancient weapons on Earth.

11:10.516 --> 11:12.848
You cannot even begin
to comprehend the extent...

11:12.919 --> 11:15.444
of what was unfolding
in O'Neill's mind.

11:15.521 --> 11:19.787
Our scientists long ago extracted parts
of the Ancient library of knowledge...

11:19.859 --> 11:22.350
and learned much from it...

11:22.428 --> 11:25.261
but we have been studying it
for as long as I can remember...

11:25.331 --> 11:28.459
and we have barely
scratched the surface.

11:28.534 --> 11:30.502
We'd be looking
for a needle in a haystack.

11:30.570 --> 11:35.667
- A haystack of infinite size.
- That's big.

11:37.577 --> 11:40.102
I am hoping O'Neill's conscious mind
can provide us...

11:40.179 --> 11:43.444
with a direct conduit
to the information we need.

11:50.556 --> 11:54.515
- You requested to see me?
- You must let us go.

11:54.594 --> 11:57.961
I don't have to do anything at this point.
If that's what-

11:58.031 --> 12:00.932
If your intent is to extract
information from us...

12:01.000 --> 12:04.026
you should know I will die
before I say anything...

12:04.103 --> 12:06.094
and nothing my master says
can be trusted.

12:06.172 --> 12:08.231
Look, no one has decided
what to do with you.

12:08.307 --> 12:11.333
Anubis was overconfident, and he
still needed the bulk of his armada...

12:11.411 --> 12:13.971
to keep the system lords at bay.

12:14.047 --> 12:16.709
The fleet he used
to attack Earth was small...

12:17.617 --> 12:21.075
compared to that which Ba'al will command
should he defeat the system lords.

12:21.154 --> 12:23.782
He will rule the galaxy.

12:23.856 --> 12:26.381
No weapons will be powerful enough
to stop him.

12:27.460 --> 12:29.121
What would you have me do?

12:29.195 --> 12:31.129
Free us to fight...

12:32.532 --> 12:34.466
or, if we must...

12:35.835 --> 12:38.531
die with honor.

12:43.609 --> 12:46.305
- He is not well.
- I told you.

12:46.379 --> 12:50.281
The process of interfacing his mind
is complex.

12:52.351 --> 12:55.377
<i>Testing, testing. One, two.</i>
<i>One, two, one, two. Testing.</i>

12:55.455 --> 12:58.447
<i>Hello. Is this thing on?</i>

13:01.294 --> 13:03.125
O'Neill, can you hear us?

13:03.196 --> 13:07.462
<i>Hey! Hey, guys. What's going on?</i>

13:07.533 --> 13:10.434
Your mind has been interfaced
with the <i>Daniel Jackson.</i>

13:10.503 --> 13:12.903
- <i>What?</i>
- What?

13:12.972 --> 13:15.099
The name ofThor's ship
is <i>Daniel Jackson.</i>

13:16.642 --> 13:20.009
All the information in the ship's
computer is available to you.

13:20.079 --> 13:24.413
<i>Ah! Right. Here we go.</i>
<i>Wow. This is cool.</i>

13:24.484 --> 13:26.645
<i>I can pretty much do</i>
<i>anything I want, can't I?</i>

13:33.126 --> 13:35.117
<i>Huh? Oh, sorry.</i>

13:36.796 --> 13:39.788
If you wish,
you may appear to us as a hol-

13:41.767 --> 13:43.257
Dang.

13:45.505 --> 13:51.034
- You okay?
- It's a little weird, but, yeah, okay.

13:51.110 --> 13:54.705
- At least you're not speaking Ancient.
- There's that.

13:54.780 --> 13:57.010
Actually, the computer is translating.

14:03.089 --> 14:04.886
I've never looked better.

14:04.957 --> 14:06.822
There is not much time, O'Neill.

14:06.893 --> 14:10.829
- Thor's planet-
- I know. Ship's log.

14:10.897 --> 14:12.865
Can you help with the Replicators?

14:12.932 --> 14:14.797
Already on it.

14:15.601 --> 14:20.436
Daniel, the computer recorded
the whole conversation.

14:20.506 --> 14:21.996
Thanks for your concern.

14:26.112 --> 14:28.103
Talk amongst yourselves.

14:41.894 --> 14:44.158
I've discussed the situation
with my superiors.

14:44.230 --> 14:46.664
We've decided to let you all go.

14:48.801 --> 14:51.269
I must admit
that comes as a surprise.

14:51.337 --> 14:55.103
It seems we haven't had much success
interrogating Goa'ulds in the past...

14:56.676 --> 15:00.168
and it was made apparent to me you're
much more useful to us fighting Ba'al.

15:00.246 --> 15:03.875
- Dr. Weir.
- You know my name?

15:09.722 --> 15:12.122
This may come as a surprise to you-

15:12.191 --> 15:15.752
Well, I'm not sure anything
can surprise me at this point.

15:15.828 --> 15:19.355
- I wish to request asylum.
- Well, seems I was wrong again.

15:20.366 --> 15:22.596
My fleet was destroyed
before I came here...

15:23.803 --> 15:26.203
my domain among the first to fall.

15:27.273 --> 15:29.264
I have nothing left
with which to fight.

15:29.342 --> 15:33.244
The only thing waiting for me through
the Stargate is shame and torture.

15:33.312 --> 15:35.974
So it is not true that I would be
more useful to you out there.

15:37.049 --> 15:41.110
Perhaps... I could be
of some use to you here.

15:47.660 --> 15:48.820
Thanks.

15:50.563 --> 15:52.622
That was great.

15:52.698 --> 15:54.723
It tasted very real.

15:58.537 --> 16:02.735
Hey, I was thinking we could go into town
tonight, have dinner, see a movie.

16:04.510 --> 16:08.173
Come on. You can't really
expect me to just play along.

16:11.183 --> 16:13.777
I gave up my job for this!
I gave up my life for you!

16:13.853 --> 16:16.185
See, that is definitely not Pete.

16:17.189 --> 16:19.180
How patient do you expect me to be?

16:22.528 --> 16:25.463
Nothing you say
is gonna convince me.

16:25.531 --> 16:28.022
I know who you are.
I just don't understand why.

16:29.101 --> 16:32.093
What do you want from me?
Why are you doing this?

16:39.879 --> 16:41.540
Because I love you.

16:51.590 --> 16:54.320
- What is it?
- I am unsure.

16:54.393 --> 16:57.760
It seems O'Neill's mind
is building something virtually...

16:57.830 --> 17:00.321
in conjunction
with the ship's computer.

17:02.568 --> 17:05.503
I do not know how much longer
his life can be sustained.

17:06.405 --> 17:08.873
Jack, can you hear me?

17:08.941 --> 17:10.704
I must revive him now.

17:10.776 --> 17:13.574
<i>Wait! Not yet.</i>

17:29.729 --> 17:31.390
What a headache.

17:33.733 --> 17:36.133
Take it easy.
You've been through a lot.

17:40.406 --> 17:44.502
- What now?
- What's the last thing you remember?

17:48.381 --> 17:50.713
Getting my head sucked...

17:50.783 --> 17:53.115
by one of those dang...

17:54.186 --> 17:56.177
Ancient head-suckers...

17:58.924 --> 18:01.449
and something about twins.

18:08.300 --> 18:11.565
Teal'c, what's with the hair?

18:15.674 --> 18:17.642
You got aspirin?

18:17.710 --> 18:22.113
You should feel better momentarily,
and your memory will slowly return.

18:25.351 --> 18:27.979
Teal'c, what's with the hair?

18:29.822 --> 18:33.553
The specifications for the device
you created remain in the computer.

18:33.626 --> 18:35.787
I believe I can synthesize it.

18:42.234 --> 18:45.726
Sweet. What is it?

18:45.805 --> 18:47.602
We don't know, but you made it.

18:49.975 --> 18:51.966
- No.
- Yes.

18:53.979 --> 18:55.571
- No.
- Yes.

18:55.648 --> 18:56.808
- No.
- Yes.

18:56.882 --> 18:59.373
You accessed the Ancient knowledge
in your mind...

18:59.452 --> 19:01.477
and instructed the ship's computer
to design it.

19:01.554 --> 19:03.545
Doesn't mean I know what it is.

19:03.622 --> 19:05.817
It was doubtful at best
that he would remember.

19:05.891 --> 19:08.086
The knowledge of the Ancients is gone.

19:08.160 --> 19:10.822
All right. Let me have a look.

19:14.366 --> 19:16.357
Got legs.

19:16.435 --> 19:17.925
Whoa.

19:20.506 --> 19:22.440
All right. I got it.

19:34.653 --> 19:38.282
Yeah. I got nothing.

19:46.031 --> 19:49.467
Penegal, I am relieved
you are still able to communicate.

19:49.535 --> 19:51.469
<i>It may not last long.</i>

19:51.537 --> 19:54.802
<i>Were you able to procure a means</i>
<i>of fighting the Replicators?</i>

19:54.874 --> 19:57.968
Possibly.
It still requires more research.

19:58.043 --> 20:00.443
<i>You should know those</i>
<i>infesting the colony...</i>

20:00.513 --> 20:03.141
<i>are behaving</i>
<i>in an organized fashion...</i>

20:03.215 --> 20:05.513
<i>unlike any Replicators</i>
<i>we have encountered before.</i>

20:05.584 --> 20:08.314
Perhaps they are being controlled
by a human-form leader...

20:08.387 --> 20:10.321
who has yet to reveal itself.

20:11.390 --> 20:15.383
If a human-form Replicator survived,
it's possible Sam survived too, isn't it?

20:15.461 --> 20:18.294
It is also possible
the old-version Replicators...

20:18.364 --> 20:21.356
created a new human form
to lead them as before.

20:21.433 --> 20:24.334
But there's a chance.
Can you scan the planet for life signs?

20:25.070 --> 20:28.233
<i>We already have. There are none.</i>

20:34.747 --> 20:36.942
Penegal, can you hear me?

20:40.219 --> 20:42.551
We have lost contact.

20:46.458 --> 20:48.449
Did you really think
you could convince me...

20:48.527 --> 20:51.655
that this illusion was my life,
that I would just accept it?

20:51.730 --> 20:55.166
If it was something you wanted
badly enough in your mind.

20:55.234 --> 20:58.795
Is that why you tortured me for so long?
So I would want this as an alternative?

20:58.871 --> 21:00.930
No, I tortured you
because I was mad.

21:02.541 --> 21:05.101
Why do you think I hated you so much
for what you did to me?

21:08.480 --> 21:12.712
From the first moment we met,
when you let me inside your mind...

21:16.422 --> 21:19.220
I saw you like no one else ever could.

21:19.291 --> 21:22.226
Human emotions can be
very overwhelming.

21:23.295 --> 21:25.991
The fact that you feel
anything at all is a miracle.

21:27.066 --> 21:31.503
- It makes you very special.
- I'm glad you see that.

21:33.672 --> 21:37.005
You don't understand.
I could never be happy this way.

21:39.044 --> 21:43.811
Then you will be unhappy...
for a very long time.

22:11.276 --> 22:13.642
Make sure Camulus knows...

22:13.712 --> 22:17.113
he will forever be branded
a traitor and a coward.

22:25.891 --> 22:30.021
- Most intriguing.
- Can you make it work?

22:30.095 --> 22:34.259
To be honest, I am still unsure
of exactly what it is.

22:37.069 --> 22:39.003
Don't look at me.

22:42.241 --> 22:46.234
<i>Thor, this is Commander Aegir</i>
<i>of the</i> Valhalla.

22:46.311 --> 22:48.745
<i>We have lost contact with the colony.</i>

22:48.814 --> 22:53.410
Aegir, communications are down.
What have you to report?

22:53.485 --> 22:55.680
<i>We have located what appears</i>
<i>to be the remains...</i>

22:55.754 --> 22:58.348
<i>of a human-form Replicator</i>
<i>floating in space.</i>

22:59.591 --> 23:02.185
<i>It obviously survived</i>
<i>the destruction of its ship.</i>

23:02.261 --> 23:05.196
<i>By all appearances,</i>
<i>it is currently inactive.</i>

23:05.998 --> 23:09.434
- Transmit coordinates.
- <i>Use caution, Thor.</i>

23:11.904 --> 23:14.270
- What are you gonna do?
- Where are you going?

23:14.339 --> 23:17.001
I am going to transport it aboard.

23:18.644 --> 23:20.134
Why?

23:20.212 --> 23:24.239
To learn the location of the human form
controlling the Replicators on the planet.

23:33.325 --> 23:35.316
Anybody recognize him?

23:40.933 --> 23:42.867
Is it dead?

23:42.935 --> 23:44.903
Hopefully not completely.

23:44.970 --> 23:49.532
All Replicators are linked by
a sophisticated communication system.

23:49.608 --> 23:52.600
If we can use this one
to tap into their network...

23:52.678 --> 23:55.909
we will be able to see
what any of the Replicators can see.

23:55.981 --> 24:00.384
And if he wakes up,
is this pod gonna hold him?

24:00.452 --> 24:02.044
Probably not.

24:05.090 --> 24:08.457
Then perhaps there is
no great wisdom in this.

24:08.527 --> 24:13.658
I will transport it back into space
if necessary, but we must take the risk.

24:18.137 --> 24:19.627
Good.

24:33.852 --> 24:38.016
- What's that?
- Replicator communication data.

24:38.090 --> 24:41.082
I am searching for any references
to other human forms.

24:44.730 --> 24:47.722
- You can't just keep me here forever.
- Yes, I can.

24:48.767 --> 24:53.227
No matter what you do, I will never,
ever participate in this fantasy.

24:56.008 --> 24:57.168
What?

25:02.915 --> 25:04.405
Zoom in.

25:11.089 --> 25:12.647
Can you pinpoint her location?

25:12.724 --> 25:16.182
She is within a small
Replicator structure on the planet.

25:16.261 --> 25:20.322
It is some distance outside the colony,
near a rich vein of neutronium.

25:20.399 --> 25:22.799
They must be using it
to create more human Replicators.

25:22.868 --> 25:24.529
I thought the ship was destroyed.

25:24.603 --> 25:26.594
At least one of the human Replicators...

25:26.672 --> 25:29.903
must have separated from
the main ship with Major Carter...

25:29.975 --> 25:32.842
prior to exiting hyperspace.

25:45.224 --> 25:46.885
Beam it out.

25:50.162 --> 25:52.687
I am trying.
It has made itself resistant.

25:55.734 --> 25:59.261
It has breached the internal barrier
and interfaced with my ship's computer.

26:40.779 --> 26:42.770
Had to do something.

26:54.192 --> 26:58.253
It seems to have permanently disrupted all
communication between individual cells...

26:58.330 --> 27:00.992
rendering each one inert.

27:01.066 --> 27:03.933
We explored such a technology
in the past with no success.

27:04.002 --> 27:05.902
Great.

27:05.971 --> 27:09.134
Does that mean we can use this thing
to whack the rest of those bugs?

27:09.207 --> 27:11.334
Even better, O'Neill.

27:11.410 --> 27:14.937
Now that I have seen
what the device does...

27:15.013 --> 27:17.277
I may be able to modify
a larger version...

27:17.349 --> 27:20.807
to broadcast a disruption wave
over all of Orilla.

27:20.886 --> 27:22.877
All good. While you're doing that-

27:22.955 --> 27:26.686
I cannot transport you inside
the Replicator ship on the planet.

27:26.758 --> 27:29.591
Their defenses prevent it,
but I can get you close.

27:29.661 --> 27:31.094
Close is good.

27:32.230 --> 27:34.357
Take this so we may communicate.

28:34.726 --> 28:37.524
- Who's your daddy?
- Stop!

28:39.598 --> 28:44.365
If you harm me or any more of my brethren,
I assure you Carter will die instantly.

28:58.450 --> 29:01.010
O'Neill, I have successfully
modified my ship...

29:01.086 --> 29:03.577
to emit a massive disruption wave.

29:03.655 --> 29:05.714
<i>Excellent.</i>
<i>I knew you could do it.</i>

29:05.791 --> 29:07.782
The weapon is 50% charged.

29:07.859 --> 29:10.851
If this works, you will have saved
the Asgard once again.

29:11.963 --> 29:14.659
I'm real happy for you.
I'm extremely proud.

29:14.733 --> 29:17.600
But we've got a little bit
of a problem down here.

29:17.669 --> 29:21.662
Fifth detected our approach, and he
claims he can kill Carter instantly.

29:22.874 --> 29:25.001
Hey, I know what you're gonna say!

29:25.077 --> 29:29.070
Her life was already sacrificed, and you've
got your whole planet to worry about...

29:29.147 --> 29:31.138
but I've got problems too.

29:31.216 --> 29:33.548
Hang on a second. What?

29:46.898 --> 29:48.889
This could be very bad.

30:12.390 --> 30:14.688
What are they doing?

30:14.759 --> 30:16.920
It looks like they're running away.

30:18.864 --> 30:21.765
- Thor, are you ready yet?
- <i>What is happening, O'Neill?</i>

30:21.833 --> 30:25.360
- They're retreating.
- <i>You must stop them, O'Neill.</i>

30:25.437 --> 30:27.462
The weapon is not yet ready.

30:27.539 --> 30:30.030
They cannot be allowed to escape.

30:33.979 --> 30:35.947
Come on.

30:43.221 --> 30:45.382
I know you can hear me!

30:48.226 --> 30:49.716
What's happening?

30:52.330 --> 30:54.560
Fifth, where are you?

31:01.139 --> 31:03.073
- We must leave.
- Why?

31:03.141 --> 31:05.666
They have found a means to fight us.

31:05.744 --> 31:07.871
The Asgard? How?

31:07.946 --> 31:11.006
- The one you call O'Neill.
- What?

31:11.082 --> 31:13.243
So many of us are left in the city.

31:14.252 --> 31:16.186
We cannot wait for them.
They will be killed.

31:18.089 --> 31:19.750
Don't expect me to be sorry.

31:19.824 --> 31:22.418
Your friends, they are killing-

31:29.334 --> 31:31.825
- Trying to stop us.
- Trying to save me.

31:31.903 --> 31:35.600
No. They do not care about you.

31:35.674 --> 31:39.235
I told them I would kill you
if they did not stop.

32:04.469 --> 32:06.733
Then why don't you kill me?

32:08.707 --> 32:11.574
You know why my friends
won't stop just to save me?

32:13.678 --> 32:15.669
Because they know,
when it comes right down to it...

32:15.747 --> 32:18.147
I would rather be dead
than be trapped like this forever.

32:20.485 --> 32:23.977
No matter what you feel for me,
I will never love you back.

32:26.658 --> 32:28.956
Kill me if you want...

32:29.027 --> 32:32.519
but if you have even one shred
of humanity in you...

32:32.597 --> 32:35.225
and you really, truly love me...

32:36.301 --> 32:38.462
you'll let me go.

33:13.004 --> 33:15.666
O'Neill, the weapon worked.

33:15.740 --> 33:20.234
Reports from the colony say all remaining
Replicators have been neutralized.

33:20.312 --> 33:21.973
While the ship did escape...

33:22.747 --> 33:25.739
<i>at least we have an effective means</i>
<i>of fighting them now.</i>

33:27.118 --> 33:29.211
Yeah, well, at least there's that.

33:31.556 --> 33:34.457
O'Neill, I am detecting
a fourth life sign...

33:34.526 --> 33:37.290
in your immediate vicinity.

33:52.977 --> 33:54.604
Over here!

34:01.753 --> 34:03.482
You okay?

34:04.889 --> 34:07.756
- Glad to see you, sir.
- Likewise.

34:26.811 --> 34:30.713
Colonel, come in.
How are you feeling?

34:30.782 --> 34:35.515
Not bad. I haven't had the urge
to go anywhere or build anything lately.

34:36.354 --> 34:38.345
You have been given
a clean bill of health...

34:38.423 --> 34:41.881
as far as the finest medical professionals
on this planet are concerned.

34:41.960 --> 34:44.394
Well, what do they know?

34:45.930 --> 34:48.421
The president asked me
to extend an invitation to you.

34:48.500 --> 34:50.491
Dinner at the White House.

34:50.568 --> 34:52.559
Do you know what they're having?

34:54.038 --> 34:57.166
I don't think I've had the chance
to personally thank you yet.

34:57.242 --> 34:58.402
For what?

34:58.476 --> 35:02.572
You risk your life over and over
and ask for nothing in return.

35:02.647 --> 35:05.878
Well, don't be fooled.
I'm making a list.

35:05.950 --> 35:09.613
Well, I doubt very much that there's
anything that could properly repay you.

35:13.358 --> 35:15.326
Are you going somewhere?

35:15.393 --> 35:18.521
As a matter of fact, the president
has asked me to supervise...

35:18.596 --> 35:20.587
the research at the Ancient outpost.

35:20.665 --> 35:23.600
It's going to be a bit
of a delicate situation...

35:23.668 --> 35:26.603
given all the various international claims
already being made on the site.

35:26.671 --> 35:28.298
Sounds right up your alley.

35:29.374 --> 35:31.569
Yeah, well,
much more so than this job.

35:32.710 --> 35:35.679
Does that mean Hammond
will be coming back?

35:35.747 --> 35:39.547
No. General Hammond
is being promoted.

35:39.617 --> 35:42.643
He'll be overseeing all things
relating to Earth's defense...

35:42.720 --> 35:44.654
on behalf of the Pentagon
in Washington-

35:44.722 --> 35:47.953
the SGC, the 303 Program,
the Antarctic site.

35:48.026 --> 35:51.985
Unofficially, it's being called
"Home World Security."

35:53.932 --> 35:56.264
Any idea who
we're gonna be stuck with?

35:58.002 --> 35:59.993
The Pentagon has convinced
the president...

36:00.071 --> 36:02.403
that there is one man
who could run the SGC...

36:02.474 --> 36:06.069
and make it politically viable
from an international perspective...

36:06.144 --> 36:09.170
despite the fact that he is part
of the American military establishment.

36:10.315 --> 36:12.715
Do we know this shrub?

36:13.585 --> 36:15.576
You know him rather well.

36:17.155 --> 36:19.146
Brigadier GeneralJack O'Neill?

36:20.558 --> 36:23.049
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

36:24.329 --> 36:25.819
Brigadier.

36:28.666 --> 36:31.863
- Well, it's on my list.
- Congratulations.

36:31.936 --> 36:34.063
I should be clear.

36:36.207 --> 36:41.304
I'd like the promotion,
the paycheck and the parking spot...

36:41.379 --> 36:44.576
but I don't really want to be
in charge of anything, no.

36:44.649 --> 36:48.050
Well, sadly, all those things
kind of go together...

36:48.119 --> 36:50.383
so I guess you have
some thinking to do.

36:50.455 --> 36:52.082
I hate that.

36:55.260 --> 36:58.093
Maybe you should break it down
to the pros and the cons.

36:58.162 --> 37:01.029
I've spent my whole life
sticking it to the man.

37:02.133 --> 37:04.567
If I do this, I'll be the man.

37:05.370 --> 37:07.361
I don't think I can be the man.

37:09.974 --> 37:12.966
You'll be inheriting a big can of worms
with the state of affairs out there.

37:14.279 --> 37:16.941
If Ba'al truly is on the verge
of dominance over the system lords...

37:17.015 --> 37:19.540
we face a formidable challenge ahead.

37:19.617 --> 37:22.882
Plus, who knows where and when Fifth
and the other Replicators will turn up?

37:22.954 --> 37:25.286
Here on Earth, we've never been
under so much scrutiny as we will be...

37:25.356 --> 37:28.382
now that so many governments
know about the Stargate.

37:28.459 --> 37:30.450
I've never had a desk.

37:32.497 --> 37:34.431
- That's a-
- Con.

37:34.499 --> 37:38.799
- Con.
- For the record, sir, you do have a desk.

37:40.138 --> 37:41.469
I do?

37:41.539 --> 37:43.530
On the flip side of the coin...

37:43.608 --> 37:46.099
nobody knows how this place
should be run better than you.

37:46.177 --> 37:48.611
Why, thank you, Daniel.

37:48.680 --> 37:52.275
With a little guidance from your
good friends and advisers, of course.

37:52.350 --> 37:54.818
If you don't take the job, we could
end up with someone much worse.

37:58.556 --> 38:01.889
Okay.
That didn't come out right.

38:01.960 --> 38:05.123
I, for one, will miss you accompanying us
on our missions, O'Neill.

38:05.196 --> 38:09.223
Yeah, now, see, I'm not sure
I'm ready to give that up either.

38:09.300 --> 38:12.235
Sitting back, watching you guys
go off and have all the fun.

38:12.303 --> 38:14.737
Risking our lives
in the face of grave danger.

38:14.806 --> 38:16.831
Yeah, that.

38:16.908 --> 38:19.502
I'm sure there'll be situations in which
you can accompany us in the field, sir.

38:19.577 --> 38:22.569
You'll be in charge.
You can do whatever you want.

38:22.647 --> 38:25.639
I'll be able to do whatever I want.

38:29.220 --> 38:31.620
Within reason, sir.

38:42.700 --> 38:44.930
Although my time here has been brief...

38:45.003 --> 38:47.164
it has been, without a doubt, indelible.

38:47.238 --> 38:51.140
I will remember every one of you,
and I thank you all for your hard work.

38:51.209 --> 38:54.667
I'm not one for long good-byes,
so without further ado...

38:54.746 --> 38:56.839
it is with great pleasure
I introduce you...

38:56.914 --> 38:59.382
to your new commanding officer...

38:59.450 --> 39:02.681
Brigadier GeneralJack O'Neill.

39:21.305 --> 39:22.795
At ease.

39:27.045 --> 39:30.503
You all know how much
I... love speeches...

39:30.581 --> 39:34.244
so... I'll make this short.

39:36.921 --> 39:40.857
I wish I could say I didn't owe
anything to anyone...

39:44.562 --> 39:46.894
but the truth is...

39:46.964 --> 39:49.455
I wouldn't be standing here...

39:50.535 --> 39:53.299
if it wasn't for
the courage and support...

39:53.371 --> 39:56.204
of each and every one of you.

39:56.274 --> 39:59.266
I hope I can be as good a leader
as we've had in the past...

40:01.145 --> 40:03.272
and as good as you deserve.

40:03.347 --> 40:04.837
Hear! Hear!

40:12.957 --> 40:15.448
The other reason I took this job...

40:16.527 --> 40:20.088
was so I could do
really cool stuff like this.

40:22.133 --> 40:24.067
It is with great pride...

40:25.136 --> 40:28.469
that my first order of business
as commander of this base...

40:29.540 --> 40:32.475
is the announcement
of the promotion...

40:32.543 --> 40:36.445
of Major Samantha Carter
to Lieutenant Colonel.

40:41.719 --> 40:42.879
Come on.

40:50.027 --> 40:52.427
The president of the United States...

40:52.497 --> 40:55.432
has placed special trust and confidence...

40:55.500 --> 40:59.163
in the patriotism,
integrity and abilities...

40:59.237 --> 41:01.603
<i>of Major Samantha Carter.</i>

41:01.672 --> 41:06.666
Major Samantha Carter is promoted
to the grade of Lieutenant Colonel...

41:06.744 --> 41:08.769
<i>United States Air Force.</i>

41:08.846 --> 41:11.110
Lieutenant Colonel Samantha Carter.

41:20.458 --> 41:24.019
Now, raise your right hand
and repeat after me.

41:25.863 --> 41:27.797
I, insert name-

41:29.167 --> 41:31.158
I, Samantha Carter-

41:43.781 --> 41:45.510
Don't be afraid.

41:46.584 --> 41:49.576
I know the first moment of consciousness
can be frightening.

41:50.655 --> 41:53.283
I will show you everything...

41:53.357 --> 41:55.291
share with you all I know.

41:59.897 --> 42:03.663
You have no idea how happy I am
we were able to collect enough neutronium.

42:16.280 --> 42:18.271
We have much time to share.

42:20.351 --> 42:23.343
We must search for a new home
for our brethren to propagate.

42:25.823 --> 42:28.314
It will pass quickly for us though.

42:29.427 --> 42:33.158
Soon enough, everyone will know.

42:36.467 --> 42:38.731
Together...

42:38.803 --> 42:41.465
we cannot be stopped.
