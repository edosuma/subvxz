WEBVTT

00:07.094 --> 00:08.747
This is starting
to look like a...

00:08.791 --> 00:09.879
Serial killer.

00:09.922 --> 00:11.750
I found a bug in my basement.

00:11.794 --> 00:13.361
If they're watching
me, Marcie,

00:13.404 --> 00:15.189
they're watching you.

00:18.105 --> 00:20.977
VIRGIL:
You were in pretty bad shape.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.413
I'm a retired
veterinarian.

00:22.457 --> 00:25.677
See, if I could patch a horse...
I could patch you.

00:25.721 --> 00:27.070
Gibbs, someone tried
to kill you,

00:27.114 --> 00:29.072
so not only is it my problem,
it's my job.

00:29.116 --> 00:30.639
Thought you'd be happy
to see the team.

00:30.682 --> 00:31.683
Not my team.

00:31.727 --> 00:33.033
Suspended.

00:33.076 --> 00:34.164
Remember?

00:34.208 --> 00:35.252
NCIS.

00:35.296 --> 00:36.471
Drop your weapons.

00:37.124 --> 00:40.083
Now we got
a serial killer to catch,

00:40.127 --> 00:43.217
but in order to do that,
we need to be your team.

00:43.260 --> 00:45.306
Say something.

00:46.568 --> 00:48.787
What do you got?

00:53.096 --> 00:55.403
Hey there.

00:55.446 --> 00:57.318
[grunts]

00:57.361 --> 01:00.625
Sorry. Guess I should've
grabbed a basket after all.

01:00.669 --> 01:02.192
Never fails.

01:02.236 --> 01:04.586
You come in for just one thing
and you leave with 50.

01:04.629 --> 01:06.196
Ain't that the truth.Yeah.

01:06.240 --> 01:08.285
Got to say, though,
I can usually guess

01:08.329 --> 01:09.721
what a fella's working on,

01:09.765 --> 01:11.767
but this load's
got me wondering.

01:11.810 --> 01:14.204
A little project
on my honey-do list.

01:14.248 --> 01:15.553
You know how it is.

01:15.597 --> 01:17.860
I honey-do indeed.

01:18.774 --> 01:20.732
[whistles]

01:20.776 --> 01:22.995
[humming]

01:28.392 --> 01:31.134
[muffled grunting]

01:31.178 --> 01:32.875
Shh.

01:36.139 --> 01:38.272
[hums]

01:38.315 --> 01:40.970
â™ª

02:06.474 --> 02:09.999
[muttering]WOMAN:Good morning, sir.

02:21.663 --> 02:23.795
Ms. Hines?

02:23.839 --> 02:25.797
Where is everyone?

02:25.841 --> 02:27.495
Director, good morning.

02:27.538 --> 02:29.671
And by "everyone" you mean...?

02:30.411 --> 02:32.848
Oh, that everyone.

02:34.241 --> 02:36.025
[exhales] Um...

02:40.116 --> 02:41.596
You got to be kidding me.

02:41.639 --> 02:42.901
Why would Gibbs want
to meet here?

02:42.945 --> 02:45.513
Hey, guys, so glad you found us.

02:45.556 --> 02:47.297
Jimmy, what are you doing here?

02:47.341 --> 02:49.125
Oh, I'm just helping Gibbs
make this place

02:49.169 --> 02:50.648
a little more work-friendly.

02:50.692 --> 02:53.651
Yeah, by making it look
exactly like our squad room?

02:53.695 --> 02:55.784
What? No, no, no,
it doesn't.

02:55.827 --> 02:57.612
Yeah, it does.
McGee's right.

02:57.655 --> 03:00.180
That's, uh, that's my desk
and that's, uh, Gibbs'.

03:00.223 --> 03:02.094
Yeah, I'm here,
Ellie's there.

03:02.138 --> 03:04.184
Ellie who? Hey, uh...

03:04.227 --> 03:05.663
Knight, you should take
that desk.

03:05.707 --> 03:06.838
No, I'm good here.

03:06.882 --> 03:08.318
No, you should sit there.

03:08.362 --> 03:09.363
No, no, this is fine.

03:09.406 --> 03:11.713
JIMMY:
You guys, it actually does

03:11.756 --> 03:13.541
look a little bit
like the squad room.

03:13.584 --> 03:15.107
It's completely
unintentional.

03:15.151 --> 03:16.892
I guess I'm just really eager

03:16.935 --> 03:19.590
to get the team
back to almost normal.

03:19.634 --> 03:20.852
Emphasis on "almost."

03:20.896 --> 03:22.550
Morning. Update?

03:22.593 --> 03:24.378
Morning, boss. How you feeling?

03:25.379 --> 03:27.294
Fine.

03:27.337 --> 03:28.469
Why?

03:28.512 --> 03:30.732
Oh, no reason,
just you got blown up

03:30.775 --> 03:32.255
a couple of days ago.

03:32.299 --> 03:34.518
Yeah, you remember all those
stitches in your side?

03:34.562 --> 03:35.954
Oh, he remembers.
Yeah, I mean,

03:35.998 --> 03:37.521
you should see
this wound.

03:37.565 --> 03:38.914
[stammers]

03:38.957 --> 03:41.264
I'm gonna go do the... the...

03:41.308 --> 03:43.179
[clears throat]

03:43.223 --> 03:45.660
I'm fine.

03:45.703 --> 03:47.227
Give me an update.

03:47.270 --> 03:48.706
No update pointing directly
to our serial killer,

03:48.750 --> 03:52.057
but we did find what is likely
a victim from last year.

03:52.101 --> 03:54.625
Adding to the four
that your "friend,"

03:54.669 --> 03:56.540
uh, Marcie found.

03:56.584 --> 03:58.281
I told you,
he is not her type.

03:59.456 --> 04:01.763
Sorry, you're just not.

04:03.939 --> 04:06.246
[clears throat]
Harold Bradshaw, 36,

04:06.289 --> 04:08.073
found murdered
March of 2020.

04:08.117 --> 04:10.728
Same signatures: hundred days
apart, red duct tape,

04:10.772 --> 04:12.556
hammer marks.

04:12.600 --> 04:13.905
So...

04:13.949 --> 04:16.343
the mountain came to Muhammad.

04:16.386 --> 04:19.041
I was, uh, I was gonna
call you, Director.

04:19.084 --> 04:20.303
But you thought
I might not condone

04:20.347 --> 04:22.262
this little off-campus
gathering?

04:23.132 --> 04:25.047
Um...[phone rings]

04:25.090 --> 04:26.570
Saved by the bell.

04:26.614 --> 04:28.224
I got to take this.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.181
Agent McGee.

04:29.225 --> 04:32.141
Gibbs... good
to see you again.

04:32.184 --> 04:34.012
In a squad room all your own.

04:34.056 --> 04:36.580
I told you I'd
be playing dead.

04:36.624 --> 04:37.929
Well...

04:37.973 --> 04:39.975
doesn't get much deader
than this place.

04:40.018 --> 04:41.455
The question is
whether you'll be

04:41.498 --> 04:44.458
known as a dead suspended agent
or an active one.

04:44.501 --> 04:47.243
The same condition?Gibbs, come on,
what will it take?

04:47.287 --> 04:50.159
You tell me, I'll make it work.

04:50.202 --> 04:52.640
I don't need you
to take the hit for me, Leon.

04:52.683 --> 04:55.251
Don't you worry about me.

04:55.295 --> 04:57.035
Come back.

04:57.079 --> 04:58.950
McGEE:
Thanks.

04:58.994 --> 05:00.996
We got a body.

05:01.039 --> 05:02.258
Not just any body.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.129
My contact
at Fairfax PD says

05:04.173 --> 05:06.871
it bears most of the signatures
of our serial killer.

05:06.915 --> 05:08.525
Most?
Red tape,

05:08.569 --> 05:09.700
hammer wounds.

05:09.744 --> 05:10.962
Hasn't been
a hundred days.

05:11.006 --> 05:13.400
Why suddenly switch up
the pattern?

05:13.443 --> 05:14.705
Maybe he's trying
to step his game up.

05:14.749 --> 05:16.011
Only one way to find out.

05:16.054 --> 05:17.317
Gibbs, if you're going,
you'll stay dead

05:17.360 --> 05:18.883
till we get this guy.Yeah.

05:18.927 --> 05:20.145
Whatever you say, Director.

05:20.189 --> 05:21.930
I'm gonna hang onto
these for now.

05:21.973 --> 05:24.193
Until you're ready.

05:25.368 --> 05:26.891
Boss?

05:26.935 --> 05:29.154
Yeah, let's go.

05:29.198 --> 05:31.374
Grab your gear.

05:39.295 --> 05:41.993
Therefore, I regret to announce

05:42.037 --> 05:44.996
that the search
for the remains at the lake

05:45.040 --> 05:47.303
has been suspended.

05:47.347 --> 05:50.393
REPORTER: Are you confirming,
then, that Agent Gibbs is dead?

05:50.437 --> 05:52.830
No, I refuse to give up hope.

05:52.874 --> 05:56.530
But, yes, that does seem to be
the likely conclusion.

05:56.573 --> 05:59.794
[reporters clamoring]

05:59.837 --> 06:01.839
Very convincing,
Director.

06:01.883 --> 06:04.320
Well, let's hope
it convinces our killer.

06:08.237 --> 06:10.370
JIMMY:
Same M.O. all right.

06:10.413 --> 06:12.372
Guy's a sick son
of a bitch.

06:12.415 --> 06:14.678
Prerequisite
for a serial killer.

06:14.722 --> 06:16.158
Did you get this over here?

06:17.115 --> 06:19.204
Yep, got it.

06:19.248 --> 06:20.902
Victim's name is
Jennifer Hanover.

06:20.945 --> 06:23.295
41 years old,
lives in Annandale.

06:23.339 --> 06:26.124
You're in charge, McGee, not me.

06:26.168 --> 06:29.214
Old habits. Though I'd
happily hand back the reins.

06:29.258 --> 06:30.651
You guys have no idea
how much overtime

06:30.694 --> 06:32.653
and paperwork is involved
in being the boss.

06:32.696 --> 06:34.481
McGee's just feeling
like we all do, Gibbs.

06:34.524 --> 06:36.613
Just happy to have you
back, sir.

06:36.657 --> 06:38.354
I'm not back at all, Torres.

06:38.398 --> 06:39.529
I'm dead.

06:39.573 --> 06:41.444
And yet you still look
so amazing.

06:41.488 --> 06:42.532
[chuckles]

06:42.576 --> 06:44.055
So how could someone
beat her to death

06:44.099 --> 06:45.709
and tape her up out here
without anyone noticing?

06:45.753 --> 06:47.929
Because she wasn't killed here.

06:47.972 --> 06:49.452
But where was she killed?

06:49.496 --> 06:51.149
I can find that out later,
but, uh,

06:51.193 --> 06:52.977
what I can tell you now is
there's no grass

06:53.021 --> 06:54.544
or dirt in these head wounds.

06:54.588 --> 06:56.154
Yeah, not any
on the red tape, either.

06:56.198 --> 06:58.113
The victim's listed as married.

06:58.156 --> 07:00.681
Let's notify the spouse,
see what they can tell us.

07:04.902 --> 07:07.122
I can't believe this is real.

07:08.471 --> 07:10.430
Stuff like this happens
to other people.

07:10.473 --> 07:12.083
We're very sorry, Mr. Hanover.

07:12.127 --> 07:13.998
And you're sure
it's my Jen?

07:14.042 --> 07:15.739
We are,
I'm afraid.

07:15.783 --> 07:17.698
Who could do this?

07:17.741 --> 07:20.744
Please tell me you caught
the son of a bitch.

07:20.788 --> 07:22.572
Not yet, but we will.

07:22.616 --> 07:25.270
When was the last time
you saw your wife?

07:25.314 --> 07:27.751
It was yesterday, around noon.

07:27.795 --> 07:31.189
Uh, Jen left to go jogging,
like she does any other day.

07:31.233 --> 07:34.454
But, um... she never came back.

07:34.497 --> 07:37.021
And then I, um...
[sniffles]

07:37.065 --> 07:38.936
I reported her missing
last night

07:38.980 --> 07:40.547
and I haven't slept
a wink since.

07:40.590 --> 07:41.983
Would you happen
to know which route

07:42.026 --> 07:43.463
Jennifer takes on these jogs?

07:43.506 --> 07:45.508
It's hard to say.
She always liked to mix it up,

07:45.552 --> 07:47.118
but she always managed
five miles

07:47.162 --> 07:48.642
at a healthy pace,
no matter what.

07:48.685 --> 07:50.208
So we're talking
a two-and-a-half-mile radius

07:50.252 --> 07:51.601
from your house?Yeah, and-and

07:51.645 --> 07:54.212
I know that for sure
because of the, um...

07:54.256 --> 07:56.301
because of the PaceBracelet

07:56.345 --> 07:58.129
I got her last Christmas.

07:58.173 --> 08:00.392
Jen always...

08:00.436 --> 08:03.178
she thanks me for it
after every run.

08:04.266 --> 08:05.789
KNIGHT:
There is no way in hell

08:05.833 --> 08:07.138
I will ever get used

08:07.182 --> 08:08.792
to notifying
next of kin.

08:08.836 --> 08:11.621
Yeah, that is pretty much
the worst part of our job.

08:11.665 --> 08:15.233
Hey, I'm not finding this
PaceBracelet here anywhere.

08:15.277 --> 08:17.540
Nothing at the crime
scene, either.

08:17.584 --> 08:19.629
Her husband gave us
her account info.

08:19.673 --> 08:22.502
If she was wearing one,
Kasie'll find it.

08:22.545 --> 08:24.547
Hopefully.

08:27.245 --> 08:29.639
Is there
something else?

08:29.683 --> 08:32.033
Yeah.

08:32.990 --> 08:34.557
Torres.

08:34.601 --> 08:36.341
Yeah, what about him?Not a big thing.

08:36.385 --> 08:39.170
But in the last day or two,
he's been really

08:39.214 --> 08:41.085
eager to give me Bishop's desk.

08:41.129 --> 08:43.392
Yeah, I caught that.Yeah.

08:43.435 --> 08:45.481
For a guy who obviously
cared a lot about her,

08:45.525 --> 08:47.875
he sure is going out of his way
to pretend like he didn't.

08:47.918 --> 08:51.008
One thing that I
know about Nick,

08:51.052 --> 08:53.184
that you might
not have seen yet,

08:53.228 --> 08:55.186
is that he fancies
himself as sort of, like,

08:55.230 --> 08:57.667
a free-wheeling, "love
'em and leave 'em" type.

08:57.711 --> 08:59.843
[laughing]:
Yeah, no, that's,
that's loud and clear.

08:59.887 --> 09:01.932
Yeah, Bishop really...

09:01.976 --> 09:03.673
threw him off his game,
you know?

09:03.717 --> 09:05.370
I think she
might have left

09:05.414 --> 09:06.937
at the exact moment
he realized how much

09:06.981 --> 09:08.722
that he really cared about her.

09:09.940 --> 09:11.594
It's like the
saying goes.

09:11.638 --> 09:14.379
You don't know what you got...Till it's gone.

09:15.859 --> 09:17.208
Ain't that the truth.

09:17.252 --> 09:20.124
If I were you, I would just...

09:20.168 --> 09:22.213
Leave Nick alone?He'll come around.

09:22.257 --> 09:23.867
He's tough.

09:23.911 --> 09:26.261
Also loud and clear.

09:29.481 --> 09:31.614
So I hear we have
a missing PaceBracelet.

09:31.658 --> 09:33.398
Not me. I'm pulling
up its route history

09:33.442 --> 09:35.400
on the cloud
as we speak.

09:35.444 --> 09:37.141
What a great feature
that is, huh?Well, great for us,

09:37.185 --> 09:38.621
maybe, but it's like
when I got my first

09:38.665 --> 09:40.710
cell phone. Everyone said,
"It's so convenient.

09:40.754 --> 09:42.538
You can always be
reached." And I said,

09:42.582 --> 09:43.974
"What if I don't want to
be reached?" And they said,

09:44.018 --> 09:45.889
"Who doesn't want to be
reached?" And I said,

09:45.933 --> 09:48.718
"Do you people even know
me?" And they said...

09:48.762 --> 09:50.633
Kasie, I got it.

09:50.677 --> 09:53.723
Point is, I'm not sure I always
want to be tracked either,

09:53.767 --> 09:55.769
but I'm glad we can do it
for poor Jennifer here.

09:55.812 --> 09:58.075
Yeah, so where was
she jogging yesterday?

09:58.119 --> 10:00.338
Uh, like her husband said,
she ran variations

10:00.382 --> 10:03.254
of a five-mile route
pretty much every day,

10:03.298 --> 10:05.517
averaging about
six miles per hour.

10:05.561 --> 10:07.084
That is, until
yesterday,

10:07.128 --> 10:08.520
when she clearly
ended up in a vehicle

10:08.564 --> 10:10.131
that accelerated
her speed

10:10.174 --> 10:11.262
dramatically.

10:11.306 --> 10:12.524
And where'd it take her?

10:12.568 --> 10:14.309
Looks like an
apartment building

10:14.352 --> 10:16.485
on Keene Mill Road
in Fairfax.

10:16.528 --> 10:18.139
Nice. All right,
text me the address.

10:18.182 --> 10:19.749
Call Gibbs,
tell him to meet us there.

10:19.793 --> 10:21.795
NCIS!

10:24.667 --> 10:26.626
Hey! Back!

10:34.024 --> 10:36.113
NCIS!

10:36.157 --> 10:37.637
Stop!I got him!

10:37.680 --> 10:39.073
I'll cut him off!

10:39.116 --> 10:41.205
NCIS!

10:53.130 --> 10:55.350
[panting]

10:58.092 --> 11:00.311
Where'd he go?
You tell me.

11:00.355 --> 11:02.618
You didn't see him?

11:03.401 --> 11:05.708
How the hell did he disappear?

11:05.752 --> 11:08.624
Not only is this guy
a lunatic...

11:08.668 --> 11:10.582
He's a ghost.

11:20.201 --> 11:21.768
TORRES:
Still can't believe it.

11:21.811 --> 11:24.031
I knew I should have
stayed on the guy.

11:24.074 --> 11:25.423
What are you saying?

11:25.467 --> 11:27.338
I'm saying that if I would
have stayed on the guy

11:27.382 --> 11:29.166
and you would've
gone around...

11:29.210 --> 11:30.646
We both lost
him, okay?

11:30.690 --> 11:31.778
Guys, stop.

11:31.821 --> 11:33.475
Sometimes bad guys
get away, okay?

11:33.518 --> 11:35.564
BOTH:
Not from me.

11:36.347 --> 11:37.914
[flies buzzing]
Ooh.

11:37.958 --> 11:39.002
Knight, you got this?

11:39.307 --> 11:41.178
That's a pretty
careless cleanup.

11:41.222 --> 11:43.093
Where there's not blood,
there's bleach.

11:43.137 --> 11:45.095
So this creep sneaks
his victims in

11:45.139 --> 11:46.575
through the back
alley there.

11:46.618 --> 11:48.316
And then finishes them off
in here.

11:48.359 --> 11:49.709
Twisted stuff.

11:49.752 --> 11:51.667
WOMAN:
I've been doing this for years.

11:51.711 --> 11:54.757
It's not easy finding tenants
for a basement apartment.

11:54.801 --> 11:57.325
Like, especially ones
like a nice guy like Tommy.

11:57.368 --> 11:58.543
Last name?

11:58.587 --> 12:00.328
Samuels, Tom Samuels.

12:00.371 --> 12:01.895
Yeah, he's
a landlady's dream.

12:01.938 --> 12:03.766
Keeps to himself,
pays his rent on time.

12:03.810 --> 12:05.942
Uh, always in cash.
Ah.

12:05.986 --> 12:07.857
By "cash," I'm guessing you mean

12:07.901 --> 12:09.990
you never did a background
or credit check?

12:10.033 --> 12:13.558
Well, six months in advance
made that pretty unnecessary.

12:13.602 --> 12:16.213
But I did make a copy

12:16.257 --> 12:18.302
of his ID

12:18.346 --> 12:20.174
when he moved in last year.

12:20.217 --> 12:23.394
It's not like I'm running
a flophouse here or something.

12:23.438 --> 12:25.788
Pretty good fake.Yeah, real good.

12:25.832 --> 12:28.051
Except for the second picture
being in the wrong place.

12:28.095 --> 12:30.575
Fake? Are you kidding me?

12:30.619 --> 12:32.055
He still look like the picture?

12:32.099 --> 12:33.709
Yeah, that's Tommy.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.755
Like it was taken yesterday.

12:35.798 --> 12:39.497
[phone rings]At least now we have
a face to work with.

12:39.541 --> 12:41.369
Special Agent Torres.

12:41.412 --> 12:43.763
MALE VOICE:
Hello, Special Agent Torres.

12:43.806 --> 12:45.808
[whispering]:
Guys, shh.

12:45.852 --> 12:47.810
Now, I don't know
how you found me,

12:47.854 --> 12:50.204
but you've got to be
a lot faster than that.Talk to him.

12:50.247 --> 12:52.075
And now I've found you.

12:52.119 --> 12:55.600
So remember, I can get rid
of any one of you,

12:55.644 --> 12:57.602
just like I got rid
of your buddy Gibbs.

12:57.646 --> 12:59.082
[scoffs]:
Oh.

12:59.126 --> 13:00.867
Now you listen to me,
you little bitch.

13:00.910 --> 13:02.825
You want to get rid of me?
Come and get me.

13:02.869 --> 13:04.435
Oh, but I'm gonna
make you pay.

13:04.479 --> 13:05.959
And it's gonna hurt.

13:06.002 --> 13:08.265
Hmm, we'll see about that.
Got to go.

13:08.309 --> 13:09.701
[click]

13:09.745 --> 13:11.965
Well, so much
for keeping him talking.

13:12.008 --> 13:13.575
Very well said, though.

13:13.618 --> 13:15.098
[clears throat]
Excuse me.

13:15.142 --> 13:18.188
That didn't sound like Tommy.

13:18.232 --> 13:20.669
JIMMY:
Hardly the first killer
to use an alias

13:20.712 --> 13:22.976
or try to disguise
his voice.

13:23.019 --> 13:24.542
Neither of which explains

13:24.586 --> 13:26.196
why he singled
out you to call.

13:26.240 --> 13:28.503
Well, the guy is really good.
I mean, first he blows up

13:28.546 --> 13:31.593
Gibbs's boat undetected, then
he escapes from you guys today.

13:31.636 --> 13:33.682
Chances are he knows
every one of your names,

13:33.725 --> 13:36.119
and you were
just next on his list.

13:36.163 --> 13:37.294
Well, that's comforting, Jimmy.

13:37.338 --> 13:38.687
Thank you.
Well...

13:38.730 --> 13:40.645
Why hasn't facial rec
given us anything?

13:40.689 --> 13:42.386
Still working
on Tommy's true identity,

13:42.430 --> 13:43.823
but the guy gets around.

13:43.866 --> 13:46.564
We got these photos,
taken from local traffic

13:46.608 --> 13:48.828
and security cams
in the past week.

13:48.871 --> 13:51.918
Been trying to zoom in
on the van's plate, but no dice.

13:51.961 --> 13:54.311
[phone ringing]Send these pictures to everyone.

13:54.355 --> 13:55.312
Including Gibbs?

13:55.356 --> 13:56.923
Especially Gibbs.

13:56.966 --> 13:59.490
McGee, on my way.

13:59.534 --> 14:00.752
How does he expect you
to send these photos

14:00.796 --> 14:02.145
to Gibbs's
flip phone?

14:02.189 --> 14:03.494
Don't you remember the tablet

14:03.538 --> 14:04.887
Ducky and I sent him
a while back?

14:04.931 --> 14:07.063
Oh, you mean the thing
he's using as a coaster.

14:07.107 --> 14:08.891
[laughs]
Not anymore.

14:08.935 --> 14:11.676
That, uh, journalist Marcie
got him using it.

14:11.720 --> 14:13.809
Gibbs's toes have officially

14:13.853 --> 14:16.333
dipped into the 21st century.

14:16.377 --> 14:18.074
Knock-knock.Fornell.

14:19.206 --> 14:20.598
It's been so long.

14:20.642 --> 14:22.339
Hi.It's great to see you,

14:22.383 --> 14:24.211
Kasie, Jimmy.

14:24.254 --> 14:26.517
What a great surprise.

14:26.561 --> 14:28.911
And hey, again,
great job last week.

14:28.955 --> 14:30.391
Last week?

14:30.434 --> 14:33.089
We're part of the same
grief support group, and, uh,

14:33.133 --> 14:35.048
no specifics,
obviously, but, uh,

14:35.091 --> 14:37.485
he had a truly incredible
breakthrough.

14:37.528 --> 14:39.139
Which would not have
been possible

14:39.182 --> 14:40.923
without Jimmy bringing me in.

14:40.967 --> 14:43.317
Well, what brings you
here today?

14:43.360 --> 14:45.493
Gibbs.

14:47.495 --> 14:49.236
Where is he?

14:50.106 --> 14:52.543
I'm, I'm sure
that you must have heard...

14:52.587 --> 14:54.937
Gibbs's boat? No one called you?

14:54.981 --> 14:56.547
Come on.

14:56.591 --> 14:58.375
Where is he, really?

14:58.419 --> 15:00.160
What makes you so sure
that he's not...?

15:00.203 --> 15:01.552
Because guys like Gibbs

15:01.596 --> 15:03.380
don't die getting blown up
in their boats.

15:03.424 --> 15:06.731
They die rescuing
babies and puppies

15:06.775 --> 15:10.039
from burning buildings
in the middle of a hurricane.

15:10.083 --> 15:12.041
That's very specific.

15:12.085 --> 15:13.129
Yet highly plausible.

15:16.393 --> 15:19.092
Okay, Gibbs is
still alive...

15:19.135 --> 15:21.050
Yes!
[chuckles]

15:21.094 --> 15:22.182
I knew that.

15:22.225 --> 15:23.748
But we honestly don't
know where he is

15:23.792 --> 15:25.446
right at this moment.

15:30.233 --> 15:31.756
[grunting]

15:31.800 --> 15:33.584
Whoa, hey.Oh, my God!

15:33.628 --> 15:35.238
Oh, God, it's you!I got it.

15:35.282 --> 15:37.588
Yeah, you redecorating
the place?
Oh, yeah.

15:37.632 --> 15:39.416
Got it?Mm-hmm.

15:39.460 --> 15:40.983
Thank you. Oh!

15:41.027 --> 15:42.419
It's so good to see you.[grunts]

15:42.463 --> 15:44.334
Yeah, good to see you, too.Ooh.

15:44.378 --> 15:45.770
I'm sorry.

15:45.814 --> 15:47.642
You knew I was alive days ago.

15:47.685 --> 15:50.166
Yeah, but here you are
in person.

15:50.210 --> 15:52.647
I really thought
I'd gotten you killed and...

15:52.690 --> 15:54.083
I'm just so relieved,
that's all.

15:54.127 --> 15:55.084
[both laughing]

15:55.128 --> 15:56.564
You and me both.

15:56.607 --> 15:58.305
Oh, and-and your boat.

15:58.348 --> 16:00.263
I-I-I'm so sorry
about your boat.

16:00.307 --> 16:02.918
Well, I'm sorry about
your office, too.

16:02.962 --> 16:05.051
Yeah, guy did
a real number.

16:05.094 --> 16:07.618
[sighs]
Oh, but also thank you

16:07.662 --> 16:09.794
for the extra protection
at the door.

16:09.838 --> 16:11.971
And I feel
so much safer having

16:12.014 --> 16:14.016
that agent out there.Yeah, team's on it.

16:14.060 --> 16:15.670
Uh, which reminds me...
Oh.

16:15.713 --> 16:18.064
Hey.
Oh, my gosh.

16:18.107 --> 16:20.457
See, I told you
you would like this.

16:20.501 --> 16:22.633
You ever seen this guy before?

16:22.677 --> 16:24.853
What, you think he's the killer?

16:24.896 --> 16:27.029
Maybe.
Oh, boy, sure doesn't
look the type.

16:27.073 --> 16:30.119
Not that there's a type to
these kind of psychopaths.

16:30.163 --> 16:31.555
How are you zooming in

16:31.599 --> 16:33.253
like that?Well, you know,
you use your fingers...

16:33.296 --> 16:35.733
You know, I showed you
how to do this.

16:35.777 --> 16:37.300
You didn't,
you-you never showed me that.

16:37.344 --> 16:38.519
Yes, I did.

16:38.562 --> 16:40.129
No, you didn't,
you never showed me.

16:40.173 --> 16:41.696
I did, too.

16:41.739 --> 16:44.568
This guy look familiar
to you or not?

16:44.612 --> 16:47.615
No, no, he doesn't
look familiar at all.

16:47.658 --> 16:49.312
Wait a minute.

16:49.356 --> 16:51.010
What about
this other guy?

16:51.053 --> 16:53.142
What other guy?
Right here.

16:56.145 --> 16:57.842
Same hat, same glasses,

16:57.886 --> 17:00.497
same mask.That's the same guy.

17:00.541 --> 17:02.673
Who is that?

17:02.717 --> 17:04.849
An accomplice?

17:06.155 --> 17:07.504
Oh.

17:07.548 --> 17:09.419
McGEE:
We can't exactly run
facial recognition

17:09.463 --> 17:12.509
on a KN95, sunglasses and...

17:12.553 --> 17:13.989
whatever you call that hat.

17:14.033 --> 17:16.165
Flat cap.
Looks like tweed.

17:16.209 --> 17:18.167
Looks like an
old-time paperboy.

17:18.211 --> 17:22.041
So we have two guys in two
photos with no identities,

17:22.084 --> 17:24.043
which means they could be
in cahoots.

17:24.086 --> 17:25.174
In what now?

17:25.218 --> 17:27.611
Cahoots. Working together.

17:27.655 --> 17:30.701
Oh, I know what it means. I just
wanted to make you say it again.

17:30.745 --> 17:32.834
[chuckles]
What I'm saying

17:32.877 --> 17:34.879
is that maybe the mystery
voice on your phone

17:34.923 --> 17:36.359
could be
this other guy.

17:36.403 --> 17:38.057
And Kasie sent another photo.

17:38.100 --> 17:40.189
Here's our guy grabbing
a cab in Georgetown

17:40.233 --> 17:42.452
just an hour ago.KNIGHT: Oh, that
doesn't help us much.

17:42.496 --> 17:44.193
Unless we match
the cab number

17:44.237 --> 17:46.935
with the time code and find
out where it took this guy.

17:46.978 --> 17:49.372
Time code, nice. I'm impressed.

17:49.416 --> 17:51.722
See? He's impressed.

18:00.470 --> 18:01.732
Yeah.

18:01.776 --> 18:04.779
You're alive all right.

18:05.562 --> 18:08.522
Who sneaks up on somebody
like that?

18:08.565 --> 18:11.612
Who plays dead
and doesn't call me?

18:11.655 --> 18:14.093
You just answered
your own question.

18:14.136 --> 18:15.920
But I knew you weren't dead.
Guys like you

18:15.964 --> 18:18.227
don't get blown up
on their boats; they die...

18:18.271 --> 18:19.533
Ah.

18:19.576 --> 18:21.622
Why spoil it for you?

18:21.665 --> 18:23.276
[laughs]

18:25.147 --> 18:28.063
Been a few weeks. How you doing?

18:28.107 --> 18:29.456
Good.

18:29.499 --> 18:30.761
Real good, actually.

18:30.805 --> 18:33.677
You still doing that
group thing of Palmer's?

18:33.721 --> 18:36.637
That "group thing" is
a revelation, Gibbs.

18:36.680 --> 18:38.117
You got to come
to the next meeting.

18:38.160 --> 18:41.946
Counseling has done wonders

18:41.990 --> 18:45.124
for me and, uh,
it could for you, too.

18:45.167 --> 18:47.169
I don't need wonders.
I need a creep in a hat

18:47.213 --> 18:49.345
to come out
of that building right there.

18:49.389 --> 18:51.956
That's what I need.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.958
You still chasing
a serial killer?

18:54.002 --> 18:57.353
From that reporter who you've
not yet introduced me to.

18:57.397 --> 18:59.138
Um...

18:59.181 --> 19:01.270
Mindy, is it?Marcie.

19:01.314 --> 19:02.619
Marcie.

19:02.663 --> 19:04.143
We're getting close.

19:04.186 --> 19:06.623
You and Marcie?No, the team.

19:06.667 --> 19:08.756
And the psycho
who blew up my boat.

19:08.799 --> 19:10.497
Of course.

19:10.540 --> 19:12.238
It's personal now.

19:12.281 --> 19:14.065
Always is with you.

19:14.109 --> 19:14.979
[sighs]

19:15.023 --> 19:17.068
What's that supposed to mean?

19:17.112 --> 19:19.070
It means that you always find
some way to justify staying

19:19.114 --> 19:21.856
in the hunt. I mean, what the
hell are you doing out here

19:21.899 --> 19:24.554
still chasing bad guys?

19:24.598 --> 19:26.208
It's what I do.

19:26.252 --> 19:27.078
It's all you do.

19:27.122 --> 19:28.950
And for how long,
Mister...

19:28.993 --> 19:31.474
Who Am I without the Job?

19:31.518 --> 19:35.086
I mean, how many wrongs
made right will it take

19:35.130 --> 19:38.264
for you to fill
the void inside you?

19:38.307 --> 19:39.265
What void?

19:39.308 --> 19:41.484
Oh.

19:41.528 --> 19:44.139
We all have voids,
my friend.

19:44.183 --> 19:45.836
You know,

19:45.880 --> 19:48.012
Gibbs, you and I,
we're like twins.

19:48.056 --> 19:50.754
We've both lost jobs.

19:50.798 --> 19:52.843
We've both lost wives.

19:52.887 --> 19:55.498
More than one.
And now I've...

19:55.542 --> 19:57.500
joined your club

19:57.544 --> 19:59.285
by losing a kid.

20:01.896 --> 20:04.377
That's not a club.

20:05.552 --> 20:08.555
It's not a club
that I would ever sign up for.

20:08.598 --> 20:10.644
What would they
even call it?

20:10.687 --> 20:13.386
I mean, you lose your parents,
they call you an orphan.

20:13.429 --> 20:17.041
You lose a spouse,
they call you a widow, but...

20:19.566 --> 20:22.569
...you lose a child,
and there's nothing to call you.

20:22.612 --> 20:24.701
There is no word for it.

20:24.745 --> 20:26.921
That's how bad it is.

20:27.791 --> 20:29.967
[sighs]

20:30.011 --> 20:33.144
I thought you were good, Tobias.

20:33.188 --> 20:34.276
I am good.

20:34.320 --> 20:37.323
Not great
but better day by day.

20:37.366 --> 20:39.803
And you could be, too,
once you realize

20:39.847 --> 20:42.066
that chasing bad guys

20:42.110 --> 20:44.243
may not be the answer anymore.

20:45.200 --> 20:48.116
Hell, it may even be
the problem.

20:51.772 --> 20:54.253
That's him.

20:55.645 --> 20:58.257
I got a visual.

20:59.345 --> 21:02.261
Got him, boss.

21:03.697 --> 21:06.090
Remember, we don't know
what this guy's done yet.

21:06.134 --> 21:07.396
Let's move in nice and slow.

21:07.440 --> 21:08.745
No promises, McGee.

21:08.789 --> 21:10.617
I'll make one.

21:10.660 --> 21:12.967
This guy is not getting away.

21:13.881 --> 21:16.362
Excuse me,
buddy?

21:18.146 --> 21:21.715
No, don't, don't...
All right.

21:21.758 --> 21:23.804
NCIS!

21:27.329 --> 21:28.548
Where you running to,
paperboy?

21:28.591 --> 21:30.289
[both grunting]

21:37.644 --> 21:38.775
Don't move.

21:38.819 --> 21:40.081
Seriously?

21:40.124 --> 21:42.083
Come on, guys, I had him.

21:44.172 --> 21:46.522
Well, that's not
a bad team, Gibbs.

21:49.220 --> 21:52.528
And imagine,
they did it all without you.

21:54.008 --> 21:55.183
MAN:
I mean, can't a guy step out

21:55.226 --> 21:57.316
for a quick cheesesteak fix

21:57.359 --> 21:59.666
without being assaulted
by not one but three

21:59.709 --> 22:01.145
whatever you call yourselves?

22:01.189 --> 22:02.451
Federal agents.Uh-huh.

22:02.495 --> 22:05.324
Sure, and why am I
being held here?

22:05.367 --> 22:08.631
Well, for fleeing
from federal agents for one.

22:08.675 --> 22:09.850
[laughs]

22:09.893 --> 22:11.634
Fantastic phrasing,

22:11.678 --> 22:13.680
Freddy the Fed. Ff...

22:13.723 --> 22:15.943
Here's our problem--
we don't know who you are.

22:15.986 --> 22:18.337
He's a weirdo.
Absolutely.

22:18.380 --> 22:19.947
MAN:
Then what do you know?

22:19.990 --> 22:21.165
McGEE: Well, we know
that there's no record

22:21.209 --> 22:22.906
of your name, prints or face

22:22.950 --> 22:24.517
in any of our databases.

22:24.560 --> 22:25.648
Why'd you run?

22:25.692 --> 22:26.954
I thought I was being jumped.

22:26.997 --> 22:28.651
Turns out, I was.

22:28.695 --> 22:29.783
We identified ourselves.

22:29.826 --> 22:31.915
[scoffs]
NCIS?

22:31.959 --> 22:33.395
Never heard of it.
For all I knew,

22:33.439 --> 22:35.092
some nudist colony in Seattle

22:35.136 --> 22:36.703
was after my ass again.

22:36.746 --> 22:38.052
We have caught you
on camera

22:38.095 --> 22:39.793
more than once
in the company

22:39.836 --> 22:41.360
of a suspected
serial killer.

22:41.403 --> 22:43.100
Goes by the name
Tom Samuels.

22:43.144 --> 22:46.408
So you and your thugs
slammed me to the ground

22:46.452 --> 22:48.279
and then dragged me
to this horribly

22:48.323 --> 22:50.673
lit room on a coincidence?

22:50.717 --> 22:52.196
No such thing.

22:52.240 --> 22:54.373
Oh, of course there is.
They happen all the time.

22:54.416 --> 22:57.027
In fact, a Harvard scientist
estimated that over

22:57.071 --> 22:59.029
four million coincidences

22:59.073 --> 23:02.206
actually happen
every hour of every day.

23:02.250 --> 23:05.427
Wow.The world's an amazing place.

23:05.471 --> 23:07.647
Okay, well, if you're not
gonna take this seriously,

23:07.690 --> 23:10.345
you leave us no choice.No choice to do what?

23:10.389 --> 23:12.042
Open that door
and never see me again?

23:12.086 --> 23:14.741
No, put your face on the morning
news next to a serial killer.

23:14.784 --> 23:16.307
See who knows you.

23:17.787 --> 23:19.702
You can't do that.

23:19.746 --> 23:21.443
Watch me.

23:21.487 --> 23:23.532
I'll talk.

23:25.012 --> 23:26.056
On one condition.

23:26.100 --> 23:27.667
We don't make deals.

23:27.710 --> 23:29.495
Turn that off.

23:29.538 --> 23:32.628
What, all of a sudden
you're camera shy?

23:39.940 --> 23:41.420
Kill the camera.

23:44.988 --> 23:47.077
[sighs]

23:47.121 --> 23:50.298
All right...
let's start with your name.

23:50.341 --> 23:52.735
Name's Alden Parker.

23:52.779 --> 23:54.433
As in Agent Alden Parker.

23:54.476 --> 23:57.000
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

23:57.044 --> 23:58.872
And I sure as hell hope

23:58.915 --> 24:01.222
that your team didn't blow
my cover out there.

24:11.101 --> 24:14.453
FBI's been covertly
building a case

24:14.496 --> 24:17.194
of its own against
this killer, Director.

24:17.238 --> 24:19.936
And by FBI,
I mean me.

24:19.980 --> 24:21.721
I've been spearheading
the operation

24:21.764 --> 24:23.113
for the last few months.

24:23.157 --> 24:24.811
Which I will confirm
with your director.

24:24.854 --> 24:27.204
Knock yourself out. And listen,

24:27.248 --> 24:29.555
no man or agency is an island.

24:29.598 --> 24:32.558
I'm more than willing
to share intel with NCIS.

24:32.601 --> 24:35.038
Really, despite your little
charade in interrogation?

24:35.082 --> 24:36.605
What can I say?

24:36.649 --> 24:38.302
I commit fully.

24:38.346 --> 24:42.132
And this case has made me pretty
paranoid about who I can trust.

24:42.176 --> 24:44.134
Especially...
[laughs]

24:44.178 --> 24:46.528
after your man Gibbs'
little mishap.

24:46.572 --> 24:48.356
The little mishap
that killed him?

24:48.399 --> 24:49.313
Nice try.

24:49.357 --> 24:50.967
But I caught a glimpse of him

24:51.011 --> 24:52.360
socializing in his truck

24:52.403 --> 24:54.318
while your agents
were cuffing me.

24:54.362 --> 24:57.452
He can't be part of this.

24:57.496 --> 24:59.106
Excuse me?

24:59.149 --> 25:01.412
Look, I like the man's style,
but my bosses won't

25:01.456 --> 25:04.720
appreciate me collaborating
with a suspended agent.

25:04.764 --> 25:07.027
Much less a dead one.

25:09.377 --> 25:11.727
First of all,
Agent Parker,

25:11.771 --> 25:14.817
if you expect your identity
to remain protected,

25:14.861 --> 25:18.342
we demand the same
of Agent Gibbs's current status.

25:18.386 --> 25:20.431
I don't want
whoever blew up his boat

25:20.475 --> 25:22.172
to know that they failed.

25:22.216 --> 25:23.522
And second,

25:23.565 --> 25:25.175
while I understand
your position,

25:25.219 --> 25:26.612
if you want us to compare notes,

25:26.655 --> 25:28.701
Gibbs has too much skin
in the game

25:28.744 --> 25:29.832
to leave off the team.

25:29.876 --> 25:31.138
Look, Director...

25:31.181 --> 25:33.183
Gibbs stays in the loop,
Agent Parker,

25:33.227 --> 25:35.795
whether you want him or not.

25:39.886 --> 25:41.757
I get it, though.

25:41.801 --> 25:44.760
Undercover, I had
to stay in character

25:44.804 --> 25:47.720
just like that plenty of
times, no matter what.

25:47.763 --> 25:50.200
Well, video camera or not,
guy had me thinking

25:50.244 --> 25:51.550
I was the crazy one.

25:51.593 --> 25:54.596
Wait, is some
of my stuff missing?

25:54.640 --> 25:55.815
What stuff?

25:55.858 --> 25:57.860
My stapler,

25:57.904 --> 25:59.862
my coffee mug,

25:59.906 --> 26:01.560
grandmother's letter opener.

26:01.603 --> 26:04.040
Oh, relax. You're over here.

26:04.084 --> 26:05.781
Bishop's desk?

26:05.825 --> 26:07.566
Yes, but it's yours now.

26:07.609 --> 26:09.655
Yesterday
when you left, I, uh,

26:09.698 --> 26:11.395
moved a few of your
things as a way

26:11.439 --> 26:13.572
of saying, well,
welcome to the team.

26:14.790 --> 26:16.400
I appreciate that, Nick.

26:16.444 --> 26:19.099
I do.No problem.

26:20.274 --> 26:22.885
But I am also perfectly capable

26:22.929 --> 26:25.932
of moving my own stuff
when I am good and ready.

26:25.975 --> 26:28.717
And not just to help you
get over your girlfriend.

26:28.761 --> 26:30.676
Whoa, whoa, what the hell?
First of all,

26:30.719 --> 26:33.026
Bishop was definitely
not my girlfriend.

26:33.069 --> 26:34.854
McGee, help me out here.

26:34.897 --> 26:36.246
This is coming completely
out of left field!

26:36.290 --> 26:37.726
I don't know, Nick, you-you

26:37.770 --> 26:40.207
kind of have seemed eager
to give away Bishop's desk.

26:40.250 --> 26:42.209
Dude, I don't believe this.

26:42.252 --> 26:43.384
Don't believe what?

26:43.427 --> 26:45.299
Just a misunderstanding, sir.

26:45.342 --> 26:48.258
Misunderstanding, really?
Well, tread lightly.

26:48.302 --> 26:49.695
I wouldn't want
our guest to see us

26:49.738 --> 26:51.610
out here bickering
first thing in the morning.

26:51.653 --> 26:53.089
What guest?

26:53.133 --> 26:54.743
Guest we're gonna have
in about a half an hour or so.

26:54.787 --> 26:56.832
FBI Agent Parker
will be stopping by

26:56.876 --> 26:58.791
to compare notes
on our serial killer.

26:58.834 --> 27:00.270
Compare notes?

27:00.314 --> 27:01.750
I don't expect any
of you to like it,

27:01.794 --> 27:03.143
but I do expect you

27:03.186 --> 27:04.100
to share intel

27:04.144 --> 27:05.449
and treat Agent Parker

27:05.493 --> 27:06.929
with the utmost courtesy.

27:06.973 --> 27:08.278
Is that clear?

27:08.322 --> 27:10.454
Yep.
Clear.

27:11.717 --> 27:13.588
Yes, sir.

27:16.243 --> 27:17.636
Any word from Gibbs?

27:18.724 --> 27:20.334
FORNELL:
Agent Parker?

27:20.377 --> 27:22.292
AldenParker?

27:22.336 --> 27:23.511
That's who
that guy was yesterday?

27:23.554 --> 27:25.034
Yeah, you knew him?

27:25.078 --> 27:26.949
Millions of years ago.

27:26.993 --> 27:28.690
He's a good agent.

27:28.734 --> 27:30.213
Not a bad guy.

27:30.257 --> 27:32.651
He was divorced,
Cubs fan.

27:32.694 --> 27:34.478
Played drums in the Bureau
band for a while...

27:34.522 --> 27:36.437
Yeah, Tobias?
I don't care.

27:36.480 --> 27:39.222
Right. So what are
we looking for?

27:39.266 --> 27:41.790
Maybe something...

27:41.834 --> 27:43.313
we missed.

27:43.357 --> 27:44.663
MARCIE:
First impressions.

27:46.099 --> 27:48.971
Dark, dank.

27:49.015 --> 27:50.669
Utterly
uninviting.

27:50.712 --> 27:52.105
It gets worse.

27:52.148 --> 27:54.803
I was afraid
you were gonna say that.

27:54.847 --> 27:56.936
Hello.
Hello.

27:56.979 --> 27:58.198
Hi.

27:58.241 --> 28:00.200
Oh, uh, Marcie,Tobias.

28:00.243 --> 28:01.375
Tobias,
Marcie.

28:01.418 --> 28:02.463
You're Marcie?

28:02.506 --> 28:04.073
I believe so.

28:04.117 --> 28:05.292
Nice to meet you.

28:05.335 --> 28:06.380
This guy says some

28:06.423 --> 28:07.816
pretty nice things about you.

28:07.860 --> 28:09.557
Yeah, you, too.

28:09.600 --> 28:11.864
Minus a few details.

28:12.778 --> 28:16.085
Our killer seems to be
something of a craftsman.

28:16.129 --> 28:18.174
Kind of like you, Gibbs.

28:18.218 --> 28:20.394
Hey, yeah! You're right.

28:20.437 --> 28:22.701
Yeah, the killer has

28:22.744 --> 28:24.746
his metal...
whatever you'd call them,

28:24.790 --> 28:26.835
and you build boats
in your basement.

28:26.879 --> 28:28.358
[Marcie chuckles]

28:28.402 --> 28:30.883
So, where does it get worse?

28:32.754 --> 28:34.756
Ooh.

28:39.587 --> 28:41.110
Hmm.

28:41.154 --> 28:43.722
She can write my
story anytime.

28:43.765 --> 28:44.940
Down, boy.

28:44.984 --> 28:47.421
You sure there's nothing
going on with you?

28:47.464 --> 28:49.553
Friends.No, you and I are friends.

28:49.597 --> 28:51.599
This woman you're,
you're only friends with

28:51.642 --> 28:53.079
until she gives you
the green light.

28:53.122 --> 28:54.994
And she hasn't.

28:55.037 --> 28:56.952
Ah, you are waiting.

28:56.996 --> 28:58.519
No.

28:58.562 --> 28:59.868
And you shouldn't either.

28:59.912 --> 29:01.304
Why not?

29:01.348 --> 29:03.002
If not you, then why not me?

29:03.045 --> 29:05.091
Tobias, will you just
put a cork in it?

29:05.134 --> 29:06.483
I have neverseen you

29:06.527 --> 29:08.398
actually jealous
before.

29:11.445 --> 29:12.925
What is it?

29:21.934 --> 29:23.936
Gunpowder.

29:25.851 --> 29:28.114
Well...

29:28.157 --> 29:30.594
that was... awful.

29:30.638 --> 29:32.901
FORNELL:Can't say you
were not warned.

29:41.040 --> 29:42.563
Did I miss something?

29:42.606 --> 29:46.045
It appears that table is
where the creep made his bomb.

29:46.088 --> 29:48.612
As in the bomb that blew up...

29:48.656 --> 29:50.484
Forget about my damn boat!

29:50.527 --> 29:52.225
How many people has
this guy killed?

29:52.268 --> 29:53.704
We don't even know.

29:55.315 --> 29:56.751
You'll get him, Gibbs.

29:56.795 --> 29:58.971
Hell, you've got photos.
You'll get him.

30:02.539 --> 30:04.541
Hey, what's going on with you?

30:04.585 --> 30:05.978
Who are you calling?

30:08.458 --> 30:10.678
PARKER:
I knew about the jogger.

30:10.721 --> 30:12.767
But not this other one.
I'll need his info.

30:12.811 --> 30:14.682
Should already be on your phone.

30:16.815 --> 30:18.512
We work pretty
fast around here.

30:18.555 --> 30:20.688
Some a little too fast.

30:21.820 --> 30:23.822
Oh, and there it is. Nice.

30:23.865 --> 30:26.563
And since we're, uh,
showing our cards,

30:26.607 --> 30:28.304
here's a victim you don't have.

30:28.348 --> 30:30.132
Craig Mucha, 42.

30:30.176 --> 30:32.482
Duct tape,
hammer wounds.

30:32.526 --> 30:34.136
Found December 2019.

30:34.180 --> 30:35.311
A seventh victim.

30:35.355 --> 30:37.139
You running OmniFour on there?

30:37.183 --> 30:39.185
OmniFive-- game changer.

30:39.228 --> 30:40.447
Yeah, you got a link?

30:40.490 --> 30:41.883
Already on your phone.Nice.

30:41.927 --> 30:43.667
Kindred spirits.

30:43.711 --> 30:46.061
Okay, look, uh, I know

30:46.105 --> 30:49.325
our little meet-and-greet
yesterday got a little ugly,

30:49.369 --> 30:51.327
but I'm willing
to forgive

30:51.371 --> 30:52.894
and forget
if you are.

30:52.938 --> 30:54.983
Forgive and forget what?Well...

30:55.027 --> 30:57.551
you guys were pretty rough.Well, you started it.

30:57.594 --> 30:59.858
Potato, pot-ah-to.
Look, I'm just trying to find

30:59.901 --> 31:02.077
some common ground
that we can all agree upon.

31:02.121 --> 31:04.166
And I just might have it.

31:04.210 --> 31:05.602
Yeah, what do you got, Kase?

31:05.646 --> 31:07.822
Ooh! So sorry.
Didn't know we had company.

31:07.866 --> 31:10.259
Parker. Alden Parker, FBI.

31:10.303 --> 31:11.913
Hines. Kasie Hines, NCIS.

31:11.957 --> 31:13.959
[clucks tongue]
And facial rec just found

31:14.002 --> 31:17.092
"Tom Samuels" again--
twice just today.

31:17.136 --> 31:19.094
First, at a car rental in Burke.

31:19.138 --> 31:20.226
He's making a run for it.

31:20.269 --> 31:21.880
And here he is buying flowers

31:21.923 --> 31:24.012
right outside
Cortland Oaks Cemetery.

31:24.056 --> 31:25.535
And that's just
a few miles from here.

31:25.579 --> 31:27.233
And this was
just five minutes ago.

31:27.276 --> 31:29.626
All right, call Gibbs,
tell him that...Gibbs already knows.

31:29.670 --> 31:31.802
He was on the phone
when I found the guy.

31:31.846 --> 31:33.456
Gibbs has a head start.

31:35.589 --> 31:37.417
Thank you, Kase.

31:49.995 --> 31:53.346
[panting]

31:53.389 --> 31:55.609
Hey, Mom.

32:10.363 --> 32:11.930
[grunts]

32:11.973 --> 32:14.628
Put it down.

32:17.936 --> 32:20.982
Did you think you'd
just walk away?

32:21.026 --> 32:22.723
That was the plan.

32:26.640 --> 32:28.468
[grunting]

32:41.002 --> 32:42.221
Stop!

32:42.264 --> 32:44.223
Boss! Boss!

32:45.572 --> 32:47.922
You gonna kill me twice?

32:49.663 --> 32:51.882
PARKER:
Stand down, Gibbs, I got him.

32:54.494 --> 32:56.104
Gibbs!

32:56.148 --> 32:58.672
I said stand down.

32:59.847 --> 33:02.023
McGEE:Boss?

33:05.244 --> 33:07.159
Gibbs?

33:07.202 --> 33:09.509
You got him, man.

33:22.565 --> 33:24.132
[grunts]

33:38.929 --> 33:41.845
No more fake names,
Paul LeMere.

33:41.889 --> 33:44.109
Thanks to your
very real passport.

33:45.023 --> 33:48.026
We found it neatly inside
that big bag of money

33:48.069 --> 33:49.636
that you had
your, uh,

33:49.679 --> 33:51.681
mommy holding for you.

33:51.725 --> 33:53.074
KNIGHT:
Even in death, you still

33:53.118 --> 33:54.771
hit her up for cash
before skipping town?

33:54.815 --> 33:56.077
It's only a matter of
time before we find out

33:56.121 --> 33:58.123
everything else
there is about you.

34:00.038 --> 34:01.691
Paulie.

34:01.735 --> 34:03.998
May I call you Paulie?

34:04.042 --> 34:05.565
No.

34:05.608 --> 34:07.697
You may call my lawyer.

34:07.741 --> 34:09.395
Sure, Paulie.

34:09.438 --> 34:11.440
You gave us his number.

34:11.484 --> 34:12.963
Maybe while
we're waiting, you can

34:13.007 --> 34:15.488
tell us why on earth
you killed all those people.

34:15.531 --> 34:17.925
Not without my lawyer.

34:19.448 --> 34:21.320
So how much was
in the bag?

34:21.363 --> 34:23.670
$326,000 in cash.

34:23.713 --> 34:25.237
Plus the passport,

34:25.280 --> 34:27.195
a few more fake IDs,
and a thumb drive.

34:27.239 --> 34:29.110
What was on it?It's heavily encrypted.

34:29.154 --> 34:31.721
Kasie's working on it now.
You met her earlier.

34:31.765 --> 34:34.072
Yeah, not long
before I met the great Gibbs

34:34.115 --> 34:36.030
and his Wild West gun show.

34:36.074 --> 34:38.206
This guy tried to blow Gibbs up.

34:38.250 --> 34:40.252
Which is exactly why
I didn't want him involved.

34:40.295 --> 34:41.992
Hey, Parker, you got
to understand something

34:42.036 --> 34:44.256
about Gibbs...[phone chimes]

34:46.606 --> 34:48.260
It's gonna have to wait.

34:49.261 --> 34:51.698
Hey, Parker and I are
heading down to Kasie's lab.

34:51.741 --> 34:53.569
Let this guy simmer
in his own juices

34:53.613 --> 34:55.093
till his lawyer gets here.

34:55.136 --> 34:56.790
That's a creepy
way of putting it.

34:56.833 --> 34:58.748
Yeah, pretty creepy guy.

34:58.792 --> 35:00.446
Yeah, creepy.

35:00.489 --> 35:02.404
And way too calm for me.

35:02.448 --> 35:04.450
Typical lunatic.

35:05.451 --> 35:08.932
Like the kind who moves things
off your desk without asking.

35:13.067 --> 35:15.287
Sorry for jumping down
your throat earlier today.

35:17.463 --> 35:19.421
But personal space is a...

35:19.465 --> 35:21.119
big deal for me.

35:21.162 --> 35:23.251
I mean, for reasons that I don't
want to talk about right now.

35:23.295 --> 35:25.123
Hey, listen, I get it.
It wasn't cool.

35:25.166 --> 35:27.429
But it also had nothing
to do with Bishop.

35:27.473 --> 35:29.953
And I get that.

35:29.997 --> 35:31.781
Still...

35:31.825 --> 35:33.653
I'm not gonna move
to her desk any time soon.

35:33.696 --> 35:37.091
Hey, that's fine, that's fine,
okay, you do you, boo-boo.

35:40.486 --> 35:42.662
I will say one thing.

35:42.705 --> 35:45.143
About me?No, not about you.

35:46.796 --> 35:50.017
If I had to do it
all over again, I...

35:53.020 --> 35:55.718
...I should've told her
how I felt.

35:57.633 --> 36:01.202
And that is the last thing
I will say about that.

36:01.246 --> 36:03.248
And I mean that.

36:03.291 --> 36:05.424
[humming]

36:05.467 --> 36:08.514
Can I ask you something
about someone else?

36:08.557 --> 36:09.776
Okay.

36:09.819 --> 36:11.604
Given Gibbs's reputation,

36:11.647 --> 36:13.083
I was sure
that he was about to blow

36:13.127 --> 36:14.476
that man away when we got there.

36:14.520 --> 36:17.305
Yeah, Gibbs' rep is
only a part of who he is.

36:17.349 --> 36:20.265
He's a complicated dude,
but once you get to know him,

36:20.308 --> 36:22.223
you'd understand.

36:22.267 --> 36:24.312
Understand what?Oh, I have no idea, I was hoping

36:24.356 --> 36:26.662
that once you get to know Gibbs,
you would explain him to me.

36:26.706 --> 36:28.490
[laughing]: Okay.[phone ringing]

36:28.534 --> 36:30.362
[clears throat]

36:30.405 --> 36:32.233
Lawyer must be here.

36:32.277 --> 36:34.366
Agent Torres.

36:35.671 --> 36:37.499
What?

36:37.543 --> 36:38.544
Seriously?

36:38.587 --> 36:40.198
[LeMere whistling]

36:40.241 --> 36:42.112
Seriously, what?

36:42.156 --> 36:44.202
Thanks.

36:45.072 --> 36:47.205
That was NCIS legal department.

36:47.248 --> 36:51.426
The number that LeMere gave us
is, uh, disconnected.

36:51.470 --> 36:53.907
Wrong number?Nope.

36:53.950 --> 36:56.301
His lawyer has been dead
for 11 years.

36:57.215 --> 37:00.043
So what, then, is he stalling?

37:02.829 --> 37:04.918
Or he's playing
some kind of game.

37:08.922 --> 37:10.924
I really want
to thank you all for sharing

37:10.967 --> 37:12.926
your personal stories.

37:12.969 --> 37:15.363
And I promise
that I will treat each one

37:15.407 --> 37:17.060
with the utmost respect.

37:17.104 --> 37:19.237
I'm just so relieved
they caught the guy.

37:19.280 --> 37:22.152
I got to, I got to call
Jen's mom and let her know.

37:22.196 --> 37:25.155
Yes, Phil, Phil.
I hope you take the time

37:25.199 --> 37:26.505
to mourn.

37:26.548 --> 37:28.855
There's a phone number
I'd like to share with you.

37:28.898 --> 37:30.726
Um, someone that you might
like to talk to,

37:30.770 --> 37:32.337
but only when you're ready.

37:32.380 --> 37:33.729
I'd appreciate that.

37:33.773 --> 37:35.296
Be well.

37:35.340 --> 37:36.776
Hey.

37:36.819 --> 37:38.560
Hey, Gibbs.

37:38.604 --> 37:39.909
Man of the hour.

37:39.953 --> 37:41.433
What was that all about?

37:41.476 --> 37:44.000
Hey, so, tell me,
how did you catch the guy?

37:44.044 --> 37:45.524
Oh, you already know?Yeah.

37:45.567 --> 37:47.482
Agent Sible, you know, the guy
that was guarding the door,

37:47.526 --> 37:49.832
told all of us before he left.

37:49.876 --> 37:52.226
Told who? I mean, who was that?Oh.

37:52.270 --> 37:54.446
I was interviewing some
of the friends and family

37:54.489 --> 37:55.795
of the victims.

37:55.838 --> 37:57.666
Uh, actually,
Toby gave me the idea.

37:57.710 --> 37:59.407
Toby?He and I went out for coffee

37:59.451 --> 38:01.801
after you left, and he told me
about his daughter

38:01.844 --> 38:04.804
and-and his support group,
and it occurred to me

38:04.847 --> 38:07.285
that I really need
to include

38:07.328 --> 38:10.766
the family survivors in the,
you know, wrap-up of my column.

38:10.810 --> 38:11.941
[phone chiming]

38:11.985 --> 38:13.595
Oh, man, I am running so late.

38:13.639 --> 38:15.380
I am so sorry, Gibbs.

38:15.423 --> 38:18.252
You're gonna have to tell me
all the details when I get back.

38:18.296 --> 38:20.472
Get back? Where you going?Oh!

38:20.515 --> 38:21.560
Mitch's cabin.

38:21.603 --> 38:23.170
Mitch?

38:23.213 --> 38:25.433
Yeah, I'm finally taking
your advice

38:25.477 --> 38:27.392
and getting out of town
for a while.

38:27.435 --> 38:29.959
I really need
to organize my article,

38:30.003 --> 38:31.787
and Mitch is
picking me up

38:31.831 --> 38:33.876
and we're driving to a cabin

38:33.920 --> 38:35.400
in the middle of nowhere.

38:35.443 --> 38:37.358
Mitch's cabin.

38:37.402 --> 38:38.577
[phone chiming]

38:38.620 --> 38:40.753
Oh... the car's here.

38:40.796 --> 38:43.408
Um, could you help me?
Thank you.

38:48.848 --> 38:51.285
Gibbs, say hi to Mitch.

38:52.068 --> 38:54.810
Michelle.
Nice meeting you, Gibbs.

38:54.854 --> 38:56.377
Thanks for keeping
our girl safe.

38:56.421 --> 38:59.337
Sure, Mitch... elle.
[chuckles]

39:02.557 --> 39:04.472
So, thank you...

39:04.516 --> 39:07.519
for so many things.

39:07.562 --> 39:09.564
Oh.

39:11.349 --> 39:14.090
I like to think we made a...
a pretty good team.

39:14.134 --> 39:15.788
Well, I thought we did okay.

39:15.831 --> 39:18.051
Forever the king
of understatement.

39:20.445 --> 39:22.838
So what-what's up for you next?I don't know.

39:22.882 --> 39:24.449
Got a lot of questions

39:24.492 --> 39:26.538
that need answering
before I decide that.

39:26.581 --> 39:28.931
Yeah, well, I figured.

39:28.975 --> 39:30.803
Well...

39:30.846 --> 39:33.109
I am kind of curious about what
some of those questions are,

39:33.153 --> 39:35.503
so let's stay in touch.

39:35.547 --> 39:37.462
Hey, text me.

39:38.463 --> 39:39.507
[laughs]

39:42.336 --> 39:44.556
[car door shuts][engine starts]

39:54.435 --> 39:56.437
It's no surprise
LeMere had the skills

39:56.481 --> 39:58.874
to stay off
everyone's radar.

39:58.918 --> 40:01.050
He'd been a highly decorated
Navy SEAL

40:01.094 --> 40:03.183
before receiving a BCD--

40:03.226 --> 40:05.490
bad conduct discharge-- in '03.

40:05.533 --> 40:07.187
Where you at with
the thumb drive?

40:07.230 --> 40:08.710
Took a while to access,
but it does explain

40:08.754 --> 40:10.016
where the money came from.

40:10.059 --> 40:12.018
LeMere has
an offshore account

40:12.061 --> 40:14.803
that's been growing
by $50,000

40:14.847 --> 40:17.197
every hundred
days or so.

40:17.240 --> 40:19.721
Every hundred days, as in...?Yes.

40:19.765 --> 40:22.158
As in every time LeMere
killed one of his victims,

40:22.202 --> 40:24.247
someone sent him a cool $50K.

40:24.291 --> 40:26.162
So he wasn't killing for sport.

40:26.206 --> 40:27.729
He was killing for money.

40:27.773 --> 40:29.688
Guy's not a serial killer.

40:29.731 --> 40:30.689
He's a contract killer.

40:30.732 --> 40:32.081
Who's paying him?

40:32.125 --> 40:33.561
It's not a who but a what.

40:33.605 --> 40:35.302
Some kind of shell company
that helps

40:35.345 --> 40:38.261
LeMere hide the true source
of his funding.

40:38.305 --> 40:41.134
All we have is a name...
Navis Ventures.

40:41.177 --> 40:42.918
KNIGHT:
Gosh, Paul,

40:42.962 --> 40:46.226
maybe your lawyer
switched offices?

40:46.269 --> 40:48.663
Is there somebody else
we can call?

40:48.707 --> 40:50.448
Public defender?

40:50.491 --> 40:53.059
I don't think
that'll be necessary.

40:53.102 --> 40:55.627
Does NCIS actually have

40:55.670 --> 40:58.934
any evidence tying me
to a particular murder?

40:58.978 --> 41:00.719
Any evidence?

41:00.762 --> 41:04.113
Like your little basement
chamber of horrors?

41:04.157 --> 41:06.725
I mean, I sublet
that place months ago.

41:06.768 --> 41:08.944
I mean, I'm just as shocked

41:08.988 --> 41:10.772
as you to hear
what went on there.

41:10.816 --> 41:14.123
[phones chiming]

41:16.038 --> 41:17.953
What about...

41:17.997 --> 41:20.652
Navis Ventures?

41:21.827 --> 41:23.132
Am I saying
that wrong?

41:23.176 --> 41:27.441
"Nay-vis," "Nav-ees," "Navi-us"?

41:28.181 --> 41:30.705
[grunting]

41:37.103 --> 41:38.539
You all right?Go!

41:38.583 --> 41:40.019
[panting]

41:43.544 --> 41:45.546
[grunting]

41:48.897 --> 41:50.377
[elevator bell dings]

41:54.381 --> 41:55.513
TORRES:
Stop! Stop!

41:55.556 --> 41:57.427
McGEE:
Hey, hey, hey, stop!

41:58.211 --> 42:00.039
Whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa!Come here.
[screams]

42:00.082 --> 42:01.649
[all clamoring]

42:01.693 --> 42:03.477
Hold it right there!Kasie!

42:03.521 --> 42:04.260
[screams]

42:04.304 --> 42:05.348
PARKER:
Hold it!

42:05.392 --> 42:07.525
Back off!Don't do it!

42:07.568 --> 42:08.700
Or she dies.Don't do it!

42:08.743 --> 42:10.789
LeMere, let her go.Right there!

42:11.398 --> 42:12.834
LeMere!Shut up!

42:12.878 --> 42:14.096
Kasie, just stay calm.Back off!

42:14.706 --> 42:16.011
Put the guns down!

42:16.055 --> 42:17.273
LeMere!I'm not afraid to die.

42:17.317 --> 42:18.492
Kasie, stay calm.I will slit her throat.

42:19.188 --> 42:21.756
[gunshot][screams]

42:22.365 --> 42:25.151
Come here,
come here, come here.

42:33.551 --> 42:35.074
[crying]
