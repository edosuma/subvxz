00:32.766 --> 00:35.403
<b>2x06- "Spells"</b>

00:38.661 --> 00:40.829
Good, Kid Pickles, very good.

00:40.912 --> 00:43.999
You really opened your eyes
to an unsettling degree.

00:44.082 --> 00:45.208
Vina, your turn.

00:49.754 --> 00:51.590
No, no. Like this.

00:56.011 --> 00:58.805
Holy smokes!
- Oh...

01:00.307 --> 01:03.352
Now that the Junior Puss Squad
are official town protectors,

01:03.435 --> 01:06.480
it is important that all of you learn
to use all of your skills.

01:06.563 --> 01:08.565
You must be ready for anything.

01:08.649 --> 01:10.651
I always am, boss.

01:11.776 --> 01:13.903
Toby, what are you doing?

01:13.987 --> 01:17.324
I'm showing Kid Pickles
that he isn't ready for anything.

01:17.407 --> 01:20.661
You made an enemy today, pig.
- No, no, Kid Pickles.

01:21.244 --> 01:23.664
Enemies do not come
from within these walls.

01:23.747 --> 01:25.290
Only from without.

01:29.919 --> 01:31.380
Who's gonna save us?

01:33.965 --> 01:37.844
A battle trumpet.
From without, as I said.

01:55.696 --> 01:57.280
Surrender this town

01:57.364 --> 02:00.242
in the name of El Moco's
juggernautical army.

02:07.999 --> 02:09.918
What army, exactly?

02:10.502 --> 02:12.796
The army of the fearsome El Moco,

02:12.879 --> 02:15.758
which numbers in the hundreds. Back there.

02:21.346 --> 02:23.348
Please, look behind you.

02:26.142 --> 02:28.604
Today's not Friday, is it?

02:28.687 --> 02:30.606
It is Thursday.
- Ah.

02:30.689 --> 02:32.733
The invasion is on Friday.

02:32.816 --> 02:35.569
Doesn't it feel like a Friday?
It feels like Friday.

02:35.652 --> 02:37.821
This must be embarrassing for you.

02:37.904 --> 02:40.574
Very. But, we'll be back.

02:40.699 --> 02:44.994
We're coming with a giant army tomorrow
to destroy your town!

02:45.537 --> 02:48.123
It's a surprise, though.
So don't tell anyone, okay?

02:48.206 --> 02:49.416
Okay.

02:50.626 --> 02:52.795
Uh, my horn?

02:52.877 --> 02:54.170
I appreciate it.

02:57.090 --> 02:58.925
Hm.
- What's up?

03:01.052 --> 03:02.805
Did I, like, miss something?

03:04.598 --> 03:08.101
We are not equipped to handle an army!
- We are the doomed!

03:10.854 --> 03:13.816
Fear not! I have a plan.

03:14.983 --> 03:17.902
Does your plan include
leaving the fate of San Lorenzo

03:17.986 --> 03:20.029
in the small hands of children?

03:20.113 --> 03:23.074
The Junior Puss Squad
is a highly capable...

03:23.158 --> 03:25.327
Can't catch my tail. Aah!

03:26.578 --> 03:29.247
No!
That is not my plan.

03:29.331 --> 03:31.166
My plan involves, uh...

03:31.249 --> 03:35.003
Artephius restoring the spell
that once protected this town.

03:37.756 --> 03:39.800
<i>What was that?</i>

03:42.886 --> 03:44.554
Much better.

03:45.430 --> 03:47.516
Artephius? My friend?

03:47.599 --> 03:50.393
I could not help but notice something,
eh... exploded in here?

03:50.477 --> 03:53.980
Puss! Oh, you're just in time
for the surprise party.

03:54.063 --> 03:56.191
Eh? What surprise party is that?

03:56.274 --> 03:58.694
Why, Owlberto's.

03:58.777 --> 04:02.030
Who is Owlberto?
Is there an orphan I do not know about?

04:02.113 --> 04:04.825
Oh, you're standing
in Owlberto right now!

04:05.408 --> 04:08.829
Owlberto is my shop and it's his birthday.

04:08.912 --> 04:11.707
I opened Owlberto 40 years ago today.

04:11.790 --> 04:15.293
Or was it 200? Three?
A million? Ah, who can say?

04:15.377 --> 04:18.129
Years! Who knows? But days. Haha!

04:18.213 --> 04:21.216
Days are certain. And this day is special.

04:21.298 --> 04:24.720
Oh, Happy Birthday, old friend.
- Artephius.

04:24.803 --> 04:27.305
We do not have time
for the birthday of a building.

04:27.389 --> 04:29.432
El Moco's army is coming tomorrow.

04:29.516 --> 04:32.143
I need you to restore
the protective spell, quickly!

04:32.227 --> 04:33.645
Oh, I can't do that.

04:33.729 --> 04:35.856
Not without the scroll.
- What is it?

04:35.939 --> 04:39.108
It's a piece of paper
all rolled up on itself and...

04:39.192 --> 04:41.862
I know what a scroll is!
What scroll do you mean?

04:41.945 --> 04:43.530
Well, I had a scroll

04:43.613 --> 04:47.116
with the recipe for Sino's
protective spell on it.

04:47.200 --> 04:50.412
I know it's around here somewhere,
I just gotta find it.

04:50.495 --> 04:52.831
We have no time for a recipe.

04:52.915 --> 04:54.624
Just tell me what to pour into where.

04:54.708 --> 04:57.878
I will do it faster
than it has ever been done before.

04:57.961 --> 04:59.045
Do what?

04:59.128 --> 05:01.924
Oh, sorry,
I was looking at this owl and...

05:02.006 --> 05:04.593
Hey, I have a hand! Weird.

05:04.676 --> 05:07.804
Artephius, we are running out of time.
You must focus!

05:07.888 --> 05:09.973
I'm on it. Whatever it is.

05:24.696 --> 05:27.783
If this is to be done quickly,
I must do it myself.

05:28.742 --> 05:33.747
Spells should not take so long.
Maybe just one tiny drop.

05:34.873 --> 05:36.499
Night terrors! Night terrors!

05:36.583 --> 05:37.960
Night terrors!

05:50.472 --> 05:53.349
Whee! They're alive! They're alive!

05:53.433 --> 05:55.978
Oh... Ow! Hey, wait, what's going on here?

05:56.060 --> 05:57.479
Back, you macramé demons!

06:02.358 --> 06:05.988
Puss, what did you...
- Nothing. Something.

06:06.070 --> 06:07.238
I was helping.

06:11.952 --> 06:13.578
Uh-oh.
- Look out!

06:45.027 --> 06:46.862
That is a big birdhouse.

06:46.945 --> 06:48.738
Owlberto, you're alive!

06:48.822 --> 06:50.615
Hap... Whoa!

06:51.115 --> 06:52.367
What is that?

07:00.458 --> 07:01.960
Everyone, inside!

07:11.302 --> 07:12.470
<i>Whoa!
- Puss!</i>

07:13.304 --> 07:14.389
Toby!

07:16.641 --> 07:19.394
Hey, watch the leather!

07:34.034 --> 07:35.118
Did you see that?

07:35.201 --> 07:38.246
I fended off a house monster
a thousand times my size!

07:38.329 --> 07:40.082
Sometimes, I amaze even myself.

07:43.334 --> 07:44.961
Whoa!
- Oh!

07:54.971 --> 07:56.098
Puss in the Boots,

07:56.139 --> 07:58.100
how did that shop come to life?

07:58.182 --> 07:59.893
Oh, uh... well,

07:59.976 --> 08:03.187
it is hard to say, really.
Probably no one is to blame.

08:03.271 --> 08:05.398
Oh, silly Puss. Don't you remember?

08:05.481 --> 08:08.026
You snuck into my shop
while I was sleeping,

08:08.110 --> 08:11.487
mashed up a bunch of potions,
and brought him to life.

08:11.571 --> 08:15.366
Oh, it's wonderful.
Now Owlberto can see the world.

08:15.450 --> 08:18.202
Perhaps someone is a teeny bit to blame,

08:18.286 --> 08:20.830
but, uh, you will be pleased to know that

08:20.914 --> 08:23.625
I brought Artephius' shop
to life so that, uh,

08:23.708 --> 08:25.877
it could help us defeat El Moco's army.

08:25.961 --> 08:27.796
You expect us to believe...

08:27.879 --> 08:29.338
Great thinking, Puss!

08:29.422 --> 08:31.049
Totally what I would've done.

08:31.133 --> 08:33.592
Except for breaking into Artephius' shop.

08:33.676 --> 08:36.888
I'm not allowed
to break into places. Anymore.

08:40.390 --> 08:43.895
All right then,
Mr. Smart Cat in the Shoes,

08:43.979 --> 08:47.398
how do you plan to control
a giant birdhouse?

08:47.482 --> 08:50.193
You're asking me how I plan to control

08:50.276 --> 08:51.987
a giant birdhouse.

08:52.070 --> 08:54.447
I'll go and talk to him, obviously.

08:54.530 --> 08:56.532
I will have Artephius talk to it.

08:56.616 --> 08:58.701
And because he takes forever
to do anything,

08:58.785 --> 09:00.745
I will tell him precisely what to say.

09:00.829 --> 09:03.372
You are going to... talk to it?

09:03.456 --> 09:05.917
Well, sure.
- With my expert guidance.

09:06.001 --> 09:07.794
Do not fear, San Lorenzo.

09:07.877 --> 09:10.005
Puss will once again save the day.

09:10.172 --> 09:11.214
Hi-ya!

09:17.303 --> 09:19.139
Greet the monster.

09:19.222 --> 09:22.475
Yoo-hoo, Owlberto!

09:26.479 --> 09:28.815
Now, say exactly the words I say.

09:28.898 --> 09:32.194
"Exactly the words I say!"

09:32.276 --> 09:33.945
Tell him he has to help us

09:34.029 --> 09:37.073
protect San Lorenzo
against El Moco's army.

09:37.157 --> 09:40.243
Owlberto, old buddy, old pal,

09:40.326 --> 09:44.914
I would be so honored if you would help us

09:44.998 --> 09:49.627
protect San Lorenzo from El Moco's army.

09:49.711 --> 09:50.545
Pretty please?

09:53.131 --> 09:57.052
Why are you making your hands do that?
Do not do that. Be more direct.

09:57.135 --> 09:59.262
He likes it when I talk pretty to him.

09:59.345 --> 10:01.389
There is no time for pretty talk!

10:02.431 --> 10:04.809
Listen to me, alive building!

10:04.893 --> 10:08.021
This town is about to be invaded
by an army.

10:08.104 --> 10:11.024
We need you to defend the town
that is your home too.

10:19.074 --> 10:20.825
Be gentle with him, Puss.

10:22.077 --> 10:25.329
House bird! We do not have time
for pecking and hooting.

10:25.413 --> 10:27.498
You will help us against this army.

10:27.582 --> 10:29.458
You will defend San Lorenzo.

10:29.542 --> 10:32.545
And we will succeed
with a monster like you.

10:38.301 --> 10:40.970
My shop! My shop is gone!

10:41.054 --> 10:42.388
I'm...

10:42.513 --> 10:43.848
...shop-less.

10:43.932 --> 10:46.726
That was not how it was supposed to go.

10:46.809 --> 10:50.438
You shouldn't have called him a monster.
That wasn't very nice.

10:50.521 --> 10:52.523
In some cultures, that is a compliment.

10:52.607 --> 10:53.691
Terrific, Puss.

10:53.775 --> 10:58.696
Our best chance of survival just ran away
because you hurt his feelings!

10:58.780 --> 11:01.866
What're we going to do?

11:01.950 --> 11:05.703
Don't worry, everyone.
I'm sure Puss has a plan. Right?

11:05.787 --> 11:10.041
Yes, a plan. That is a thing that I have.

11:10.125 --> 11:12.919
I will find Owlberto, heroically,

11:13.002 --> 11:15.504
so that he may help us defend San Lorenzo.

11:17.632 --> 11:19.175
And I'll go with you.

11:19.259 --> 11:20.885
No. You must stay here.

11:20.969 --> 11:23.054
Work on the spell. I know you can do this.

11:23.138 --> 11:24.388
I can't.

11:24.472 --> 11:26.808
I need that scroll and it's in my shop,

11:26.891 --> 11:29.144
and you made him sad and ran him away.

11:29.227 --> 11:31.854
Then brainstorm. Come up with something.

11:31.938 --> 11:33.731
There are no bad ideas.

11:33.815 --> 11:36.901
Ooh! Something with interpretive dance.

11:36.985 --> 11:39.654
There are some bad ideas.

11:39.737 --> 11:42.157
Bootsy, when you find Owlberto,

11:42.240 --> 11:43.950
remember to be patient.

11:44.033 --> 11:45.118
He's new.

11:45.201 --> 11:46.953
No time! I will be patient later.

11:47.036 --> 11:50.539
Babieca, follow that birdhouse!

11:50.623 --> 11:52.167
Bye, Puss!

11:56.296 --> 11:58.965
Are these hypoallergenic?

11:59.548 --> 12:00.967
Huh?

12:01.843 --> 12:03.719
Look at all these tiny swords.

12:11.019 --> 12:14.522
And this, a tiny trident
for a little gladiator.

12:14.605 --> 12:16.983
But this is too small for fighting.

12:17.608 --> 12:20.028
Because it is silverware?

12:21.445 --> 12:23.572
How about cannons, boss?

12:23.656 --> 12:25.783
Ugly here is selling cannons.

12:27.869 --> 12:31.080
Why does everyone in this market
sell such tiny items?

12:31.164 --> 12:34.417
Are resources scarce?
We need something big.

12:34.500 --> 12:36.502
Something really...

12:43.885 --> 12:47.055
That's a big birdhouse.

13:12.830 --> 13:15.166
He is here. Our guest of honor.

13:15.250 --> 13:18.461
Welcome to El Moco's army, amigo.

13:19.045 --> 13:22.340
So, grande, you must be hungry
all the time, huh?

13:23.425 --> 13:24.759
Here!

13:28.471 --> 13:30.932
Yes. Yes. We are great friends.

13:31.015 --> 13:33.142
Pretty birdie. So pretty.

13:33.226 --> 13:37.188
Perfect.

14:09.762 --> 14:10.888
Huh?

14:14.309 --> 14:16.144
I heard an insignificant noise.

14:16.227 --> 14:18.062
We must tell El Moco at once!

14:24.986 --> 14:26.112
Owlberto.

14:26.195 --> 14:28.239
Psst. I am whispering to you.

14:30.992 --> 14:34.120
I think we got off
on the wrong foot-claw-talon.

14:34.203 --> 14:38.582
Shh! Listen. You must return with me
to San Lorenzo. Quiet!

14:43.338 --> 14:45.381
Okay, okay, I am leaving.

14:45.465 --> 14:46.382
Happy?

14:52.347 --> 14:54.140
Puss in the Boots.

14:54.265 --> 14:56.434
Mm? Ooh!
I did not see you there.

14:56.518 --> 14:59.228
Yes, well, hello, and goodbye.

14:59.312 --> 15:01.981
No, no, no. Stay a while.

15:02.064 --> 15:04.526
Meet our new weapon of choice.

15:04.608 --> 15:08.988
Uh, large Owl Building.
- His name is Owlberto.

15:09.071 --> 15:11.866
And he's coming with me. Owlberto, attack!

15:16.371 --> 15:18.581
Owlberto, what are you doing?

15:19.582 --> 15:24.920
You underestimate the friendship
between a man and his owl-thing.

15:31.093 --> 15:33.804
Imprison this interloper
within your walls.

15:33.888 --> 15:36.224
He will ride with us to San Lorenzo,

15:36.307 --> 15:39.894
that he may witness firsthand
his home's destruction.

15:52.407 --> 15:55.243
Owlberto, you are making a huge mistake!

15:55.326 --> 15:56.702
You must let me out!

16:25.022 --> 16:26.399
I have been a fool.

16:26.482 --> 16:28.692
I was rude and impatient to Owlberto

16:28.776 --> 16:31.070
and now all my friends are in danger.

16:31.153 --> 16:32.572
I must set this right.

16:38.160 --> 16:39.537
You, owls!

16:39.621 --> 16:41.456
Do you enjoy macramé crickets?

16:42.624 --> 16:44.292
You can have all you want

16:44.375 --> 16:47.420
if you deliver this letter
to Artephius. Now go.

16:49.880 --> 16:51.132
I hope this works.

16:56.845 --> 16:59.056
Prepare the siege engine.

16:59.140 --> 17:03.018
Load the catapult.
Set the fire moat ablaze!

17:03.102 --> 17:04.728
We don't have any of those things.

17:04.811 --> 17:06.939
Uh, well...

17:07.021 --> 17:08.898
I have a wee cannon.

17:11.819 --> 17:13.028
Malcolm.

17:13.112 --> 17:15.739
Hey, there's a note in this one's beak.

17:17.992 --> 17:19.410
It's a message from Puss.

17:19.493 --> 17:21.119
He says to...

17:22.246 --> 17:23.539
Stop everything!

17:23.623 --> 17:27.209
Puss wants us to do something kinda weird.

17:27.292 --> 17:29.837
There's something you think is weird?

17:50.274 --> 17:54.236
Attack! Destroy everything.

18:06.081 --> 18:07.958
<i>Happy birthday!</i>

18:08.042 --> 18:09.711
Happy birthday!

18:13.005 --> 18:14.716
Trying to bribe me with cake?

18:15.675 --> 18:16.592
Well...

18:19.970 --> 18:21.639
My birthday was last month,

18:21.723 --> 18:24.684
so now I'm angrier
because you forgot it.

18:24.767 --> 18:26.185
The cake isn't for you.

18:26.268 --> 18:30.398
It's for my friend, Owlberto.
Happy birthday, Owlberto.

18:30.481 --> 18:33.025
This is for this one
and all the ones we've missed.

18:33.108 --> 18:36.987
This is not how an invasion goes.

18:37.988 --> 18:41.576
Owlberto, I am sorry
that I was not patient with you earlier,

18:41.659 --> 18:44.078
and I did not take the time
to get to know you.

18:44.161 --> 18:46.205
You are a stand-up bird.

18:46.288 --> 18:48.416
Anyone, person or building,

18:48.499 --> 18:52.545
who is important to my friend, Artephius,
is important to me as well.

18:52.628 --> 18:54.004
To all of us!

18:57.049 --> 18:59.510
Stop it! Stop it, stop it, stop it!

18:59.594 --> 19:01.303
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

19:01.387 --> 19:03.514
We are having an invasion!

19:04.390 --> 19:06.141
Artephius!

19:06.225 --> 19:09.061
You big dumb owl, smash this town!

19:09.645 --> 19:11.855
Do it or I'll run this old man through.

19:13.899 --> 19:15.735
Do as I say, monster.

19:30.708 --> 19:31.917
<i>I hate this box.</i>

19:57.943 --> 20:00.904
Aw, the spell is wearing off.

20:00.988 --> 20:04.492
Looks like my shop
is gonna go back to being...

20:04.575 --> 20:06.118
just a shop.

20:08.830 --> 20:11.999
Artephius, I am so sorry.

20:12.082 --> 20:15.085
You were right,
I should have been more patient.

20:16.962 --> 20:17.963
Puss.

20:21.342 --> 20:23.594
Of course. Let us all stand over there

20:23.678 --> 20:25.638
and pretend we are not listening.

20:30.476 --> 20:33.354
I'm glad you're back, Owlberto old buddy.

20:33.437 --> 20:35.063
Back home where you belong.

20:38.233 --> 20:41.737
I may be losing my mind,
but I'll never lose my heart.

20:41.821 --> 20:42.780
And that's you.

20:45.825 --> 20:47.702
But you're also my brains.

20:47.785 --> 20:51.205
In your walls, I got
all the thinks I ever thunk.

20:51.288 --> 20:52.498
I just gotta find 'em.

20:52.581 --> 20:54.917
Like I gotta find that one scroll.

21:03.133 --> 21:04.051
Is this...

21:05.803 --> 21:07.805
It is! Owlberto!

21:07.889 --> 21:10.391
You found the Great Mage Sino's spell.

21:10.474 --> 21:12.852
We are saved!

21:12.976 --> 21:15.521
Oh, thank you, Owlberto! Thank you.

21:42.005 --> 21:44.550
We will never forget him.

21:44.633 --> 21:48.763
Mostly because he's a giant shop
in the middle of our town. But still.

21:49.346 --> 21:51.933
Well, Bruno, we have a lot of work to do.

21:52.015 --> 21:54.142
This scroll's written in a dead language,

21:54.226 --> 21:56.520
so it's gonna take some time to translate.

21:56.604 --> 21:58.355
Take all the time you need.

21:58.439 --> 22:01.066
I feel that our luck is about to change.

22:02.109 --> 22:06.488
Hey! This isn't just a spell,
there's also a prophecy.

22:06.572 --> 22:11.159
Ooh, I recognize this bit.
It says, "San Lorenzo is..."

22:11.243 --> 22:12.286
Wait, what's this word?

22:12.870 --> 22:15.581
Happy? Healthy? A great vacation spot?

22:16.540 --> 22:17.458
"Doomed."

22:25.132 --> 22:26.216
Hey, guys.

22:27.760 --> 22:31.138
I missed
something again, didn't I?

22:38.313 --> 22:41.713
