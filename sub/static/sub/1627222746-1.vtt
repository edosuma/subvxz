WEBVTT

01:21.708 --> 01:22.909
Welcome home.

02:07.019 --> 02:10.455
Few men have had both
the courage and compassion

02:10.489 --> 02:12.892
possessed by our dear judge.

02:12.925 --> 02:16.428
Let us show the compassion
that he showed others

02:16.461 --> 02:19.297
by following the words
of our dear Lord

02:19.331 --> 02:22.034
from Matthew chapter 5.

02:22.068 --> 02:25.705
"You have heard it said that
you should love thy neighbor

02:25.738 --> 02:27.640
and hate thine enemy,

02:27.673 --> 02:31.343
but I say unto you,
'Love your enemy.'"

02:54.867 --> 02:56.769
They're crowding in.

02:56.803 --> 02:59.371
I need a drink, Abel.

02:59.404 --> 03:00.539
It's early.

03:02.975 --> 03:05.912
Mm, mm, mm.

03:05.945 --> 03:07.647
That was a beautiful service,
right?

03:07.680 --> 03:10.683
Yeah, Daddy would be proud.

03:13.618 --> 03:15.487
Oh, don't give me that look.

03:15.520 --> 03:17.360
Even God can see
the necessity of getting drunk

03:17.389 --> 03:19.759
on a day like today.

03:47.419 --> 03:48.788
Thank you, Walter.

03:48.821 --> 03:50.422
Good luck.

03:53.159 --> 03:55.795
Baby, there's a whole
lot of folks out there

03:55.828 --> 03:57.997
that want to pay their respects.

03:58.030 --> 03:59.732
Okay.

03:59.765 --> 04:01.033
Right.

04:01.067 --> 04:03.468
Let's get this over with.

04:07.640 --> 04:11.043
And her second husband
was a polo player.

04:11.077 --> 04:13.145
Doesn't it sound glamorous?

04:13.179 --> 04:15.748
Sounds to me
like she can't keep a man.

04:15.781 --> 04:17.783
- Divorced.
- Twice.

04:17.817 --> 04:20.052
- Are you busy later?
- And the other one,

04:20.086 --> 04:21.562
well they say
he wasn't much more than

04:21.586 --> 04:23.055
a playboy himself.

04:23.089 --> 04:24.924
Who would play around on her?

04:24.957 --> 04:27.459
Oh, my God, you act
as though you know her.

04:27.492 --> 04:29.461
You know she wouldn't
give you the time of day.

04:29.494 --> 04:31.130
What do you know
about fitting in?

04:31.163 --> 04:32.932
All the important men
were at the meatballs

04:32.965 --> 04:34.700
and you were at the dip.

04:34.734 --> 04:36.869
- It's all BS.
- It's communist talk.

04:36.903 --> 04:39.872
- Damn right.
- Them Yankees and unions.

04:39.906 --> 04:42.008
- Down here causing problems.
- Mhm.

04:42.041 --> 04:43.676
- Drink, sir?
- Thank you.

04:43.709 --> 04:45.678
Obliged.

04:45.711 --> 04:47.545
- Thank you.
- Very much.

04:49.749 --> 04:51.884
And it's that King and his boys.

04:51.918 --> 04:53.886
They're gonna send us all
to hell in a handbasket

04:53.920 --> 04:55.755
with the Civil Rights Bill.

04:55.788 --> 04:56.956
You gotta stop this nonsense.

04:56.989 --> 04:58.658
Now, hold on.

04:58.691 --> 05:00.893
We are nowhere near
hell in a handbasket.

05:00.927 --> 05:03.495
We are here to pay respects
to a good man,

05:03.528 --> 05:05.164
one of the best.

05:05.197 --> 05:06.999
Judge,

05:07.033 --> 05:09.735
your wisdom
will sorely be missed.

05:11.938 --> 05:13.571
- Safe landing.
- Here, here.

05:13.605 --> 05:15.573
Here, here.

05:23.249 --> 05:26.484
Smells like they put out
the meatballs.

05:26.518 --> 05:28.854
Come on, boys,
you can't miss this.

05:40.700 --> 05:42.534
Oh, my.

05:44.602 --> 05:46.639
Don't be shy, boys,
you better dig in

05:46.672 --> 05:48.016
'cause these puppies
are gonna go quick.

05:48.040 --> 05:49.651
Now, they got these
little toothpicks here,

05:49.675 --> 05:51.744
but I'm gonna grab
one of those plates.

06:04.190 --> 06:06.258
So sorry for your loss.

06:06.292 --> 06:08.194
Oh, thank you,
thank you so much.

06:08.227 --> 06:11.630
- Thank you for coming.
- Mhm.

06:11.664 --> 06:13.933
Maybe she'll come home
to run this place.

06:13.966 --> 06:16.202
That is not going to happen.

06:16.235 --> 06:17.737
- Thank you so much.
- I'm so sorry.

06:17.770 --> 06:20.572
- I know, it's so sad.
- Grace.

06:20.605 --> 06:22.241
Excuse me.

06:22.274 --> 06:23.685
I don't know how she does it,
but Mattie's cooking

06:23.709 --> 06:25.111
just gets better and better.

06:25.144 --> 06:27.545
Hi.

06:27.579 --> 06:29.815
Thank you for coming.

06:29.849 --> 06:32.918
- I'm gonna miss your father.
- Me too.

06:32.952 --> 06:35.221
Man, you are more beautiful
each time I see you.

06:35.254 --> 06:37.223
Mm.

06:37.256 --> 06:40.558
And you are always
a charming politician.

06:40.592 --> 06:43.029
Your father kept me up
on all your escapades.

06:43.062 --> 06:45.297
"Escapades," hm.

06:45.331 --> 06:47.199
Well, I hope
they weren't too boring.

06:47.233 --> 06:50.836
On the contrary,
I was living vicariously.

06:52.371 --> 06:54.082
Congressman, Sophia Spencer
needs to see you

06:54.106 --> 06:56.809
in the other room.

06:56.842 --> 06:59.945
Excuse me, my fan club awaits.

06:59.979 --> 07:01.981
- Call me if you need me.
- I will.

07:04.717 --> 07:06.152
Con...

07:07.853 --> 07:11.223
Miss... Mrs. Gordon?

07:11.257 --> 07:14.126
- Yes?
- I'm... I'm Bradford Lotts.

07:14.160 --> 07:17.763
I'll be the one at the bank
to handle your father's affairs.

07:17.797 --> 07:20.032
Clear... clear things up.

07:20.066 --> 07:23.235
- We will need to talk.
- Oh no, that's, um, fine.

07:23.269 --> 07:26.238
Just leave things as they are.

07:26.272 --> 07:28.040
- Well...
- And have you tried that dip?

07:28.074 --> 07:30.042
It's delicious. Excuse me.

07:32.912 --> 07:34.814
Snotty bitch.

07:34.847 --> 07:36.614
What did she say?

07:36.649 --> 07:39.085
Useless female,
that's what she is.

07:42.721 --> 07:44.090
Will you excuse me?

07:46.759 --> 07:48.828
Come on, Walter,
we're on the move.

07:48.861 --> 07:50.963
I'll catch you later.

07:50.996 --> 07:53.799
- You ain't get me nothing?
- You know I did.

07:53.833 --> 07:55.634
I wanna see this here.

07:57.670 --> 07:59.839
- No meatballs?
- You ingrate.

07:59.872 --> 08:01.783
I couldn't bring you meatballs,
the red barbecue sauce

08:01.807 --> 08:03.943
would stain my pocket.

08:03.976 --> 08:05.945
Best kitchen in 20 miles...
let's get rolling

08:05.978 --> 08:08.814
before another constituent
feels the need to chew my ass.

08:13.052 --> 08:14.420
All right, Walter.

08:22.394 --> 08:25.131
All right now.

08:25.164 --> 08:26.799
I look terrible in black.

08:26.832 --> 08:28.076
I mean, why wear black
to funerals?

08:28.100 --> 08:31.804
Why not red to celebrate?

08:31.837 --> 08:33.405
Daddy's life
should be celebrated.

08:33.439 --> 08:35.407
Sure should, baby, sure should.

08:35.441 --> 08:37.743
Now, get on out of this dress.

08:37.776 --> 08:39.678
You know what I heard them say?

08:39.712 --> 08:41.347
Narrow-minded little ninnies.

08:41.380 --> 08:43.382
- What'd they say?
- They said that I was

08:43.415 --> 08:45.251
a spoiled,

08:45.284 --> 08:48.387
middle-aged

08:48.420 --> 08:51.323
divorcÃ©e,

08:51.357 --> 08:55.027
and good for nothing.

08:55.060 --> 08:57.830
Ugh, oh, and useless.

08:57.863 --> 08:59.465
- That's what they said.
- Don't you mind

08:59.498 --> 09:02.134
what they sayin',
'cause you know who you are.

09:02.168 --> 09:04.336
No, maybe I don't.

09:04.370 --> 09:06.772
I know I've been...

09:06.805 --> 09:09.441
a good man's daughter,
and two not-so-good men's wife,

09:09.475 --> 09:13.379
but... I mean, otherwise,
am I useless?

09:13.412 --> 09:16.982
No, baby, don't fix your mind
thinking that.

09:17.016 --> 09:19.351
Our God has a plan.

09:19.385 --> 09:21.253
I wish I had your faith, Mattie.

09:21.287 --> 09:23.923
Well, it don't matter
if you do or you don't,

09:23.956 --> 09:25.491
He's still looking out for you.

09:25.524 --> 09:28.394
Ugh.

09:28.427 --> 09:30.496
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, precious.

10:24.917 --> 10:27.953
- Ooh, here we go.
- Where?

10:27.987 --> 10:29.788
Mm, mm, mm.

10:40.099 --> 10:42.234
- First, if you don't mind.
- Good morning.

10:42.268 --> 10:43.902
Hello.

10:45.971 --> 10:49.208
- Uh, Dad, the...
- Well, who are they...

10:49.241 --> 10:51.877
and what can they be
talking about?

10:51.910 --> 10:54.413
New York? Dick, come look.

10:54.446 --> 10:56.815
I'm watching The Secret Storm.

10:56.849 --> 10:59.485
Those TV airwaves
are gonna scramble your brain.

10:59.518 --> 11:02.488
Ugh, who cares?

11:02.521 --> 11:04.590
Gonna go around
with a scrambled brain?

11:04.623 --> 11:06.458
Well, sounds pretty good to me.

11:06.492 --> 11:08.527
And that's on your account.

11:08.560 --> 11:12.031
It's on account of a man like
you took an interest in me,

11:12.064 --> 11:13.866
and I wanna say thanks.

11:13.899 --> 11:15.410
Well, I'm glad things
are going well, Kate.

11:15.434 --> 11:16.969
Well, they seem to be,

11:17.002 --> 11:19.905
I report for
modeling assignments tomorrow.

11:19.938 --> 11:22.374
Ma'am, your meter has expired,

11:22.408 --> 11:26.178
and the new meter maid
is unforgiving.

11:29.581 --> 11:31.150
Thank you.

11:31.183 --> 11:32.484
Have a good day.

11:45.632 --> 11:47.533
Yes, ma'am, may I help you?

11:47.566 --> 11:50.402
I need to have a few words
with someone about my accounts.

11:50.436 --> 11:53.038
- Mr. Lotts.
- Mr. Lotts, yes.

11:56.008 --> 11:58.043
Can you tell him
that I'm waiting?

11:58.077 --> 12:00.546
Yes, ma'am, have a seat,
we'll be with you in a moment.

12:09.922 --> 12:12.324
I'm finished with this one,
if you want it.

12:12.358 --> 12:13.669
It's mostly about
Liz Taylor and her affair

12:13.693 --> 12:15.327
with that Welshman.

12:15.361 --> 12:17.596
Even a big movie star
has trouble with her men.

12:17.630 --> 12:19.898
Well, I guess you get
what you settle for.

12:19.932 --> 12:21.200
Yes, ma'am, I guess you do.

12:23.102 --> 12:24.346
Well, if we're gonna
talk about men,

12:24.370 --> 12:26.171
I should introduce myself.

12:26.205 --> 12:28.374
- Grace Gordon.
- I'm Ruth,

12:28.407 --> 12:30.609
and this is my girl, Angelina.

12:35.247 --> 12:37.383
Well, that's
a very pretty dress, Angelina.

12:37.416 --> 12:40.085
- Thanks.
- So fancy.

12:43.622 --> 12:45.190
God!

12:47.326 --> 12:50.129
I told you not to bother me
this morning, I am busy.

12:50.162 --> 12:52.164
Well, the office is filling up.

12:52.197 --> 12:53.633
One woman looks
like a real tart,

12:53.666 --> 12:55.401
and she's got a child with her.

12:55.434 --> 12:57.145
The way that child
is clutching a paper sack,

12:57.169 --> 12:58.937
I think it's full of money.

12:58.971 --> 13:00.673
And Mrs. Gordon is here.

13:02.374 --> 13:04.410
Oh!

13:04.443 --> 13:07.346
So, today is not going to be
a complete bore.

13:07.379 --> 13:10.115
She said she's here
to give you a few words.

13:10.149 --> 13:12.584
Oh, she is, is she?

13:12.618 --> 13:15.988
Well, I have a few words
for her as well.

13:20.660 --> 13:24.163
In, um... in 10 minutes,
I want you to come interrupt us.

13:25.397 --> 13:27.599
And is your dolly a good girl?

13:27.634 --> 13:30.502
- Mhm.
- Um, uh, Mrs. Gordon.

13:30.536 --> 13:32.538
- Please, please, come in.
- Well, these ladies

13:32.571 --> 13:34.674
- were before me.
- I... I insist, please.

13:34.707 --> 13:36.284
That's all right, ma'am,
we'll just sit here

13:36.308 --> 13:38.177
in the cool air.

13:38.210 --> 13:39.646
- Sure?
- Yeah.

13:39.679 --> 13:41.947
- It was very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

13:45.050 --> 13:47.019
What are you doing here?

13:47.052 --> 13:49.321
I wanna put my money
in a safe place,

13:49.354 --> 13:51.032
and the paper says
you're giving out toasters

13:51.056 --> 13:52.701
- to new depositors.
- The bank doesn't take

13:52.725 --> 13:55.360
your kind of money.

13:55.394 --> 13:58.263
My money's green,
like everyone else's,

13:58.297 --> 14:01.166
and I earned it, the hard way,

14:01.200 --> 14:03.068
and who knows it
better than you?

14:06.639 --> 14:09.107
Come on, let's go.

14:11.410 --> 14:14.714
Please, have a... seat.

14:14.747 --> 14:17.549
Um, you know, I... I have called.

14:17.583 --> 14:20.185
I've, uh... I've left
several messages with...

14:20.219 --> 14:22.488
Yes, it seems like
there's been a breakdown,

14:22.521 --> 14:24.289
and had it not been for

14:24.323 --> 14:27.059
a stack of Mattie's famous
sweet potato pancakes,

14:27.092 --> 14:29.696
our water would've been
turned off.

14:29.729 --> 14:31.497
Well, uh, Mrs. Gordon,

14:31.530 --> 14:35.735
let's, uh... let's best see
how to describe this breakdown.

14:35.768 --> 14:38.805
The bank pays bills with money
from a customer's account...

14:38.838 --> 14:41.240
Yes, I know that.

14:41.273 --> 14:43.710
I have to go to lunch,
so if you could just

14:43.743 --> 14:47.579
deal with these quickly,
and move them forward.

14:47.613 --> 14:50.382
We don't really like
disturbances.

14:52.150 --> 14:54.086
No, no, most...

14:54.119 --> 14:56.355
most people do not like
disturbances,

14:56.388 --> 14:59.591
but, uh, you've got one now.

14:59.625 --> 15:03.128
You see, there is no money
in the account.

15:03.161 --> 15:05.330
I don't understand,
where was the money put?

15:05.364 --> 15:08.267
Well, your father transferred
a great deal of what he had

15:08.300 --> 15:09.802
to you over the years,

15:09.836 --> 15:11.470
and sold off land along the way

15:11.503 --> 15:14.674
to, uh, keep you up
in your adventures,

15:14.707 --> 15:16.743
oh, and... and marriages.

15:16.776 --> 15:18.778
Been two, right?

15:18.811 --> 15:22.180
So, the account
is dry as a bone.

15:22.214 --> 15:25.217
Now, the house
and what land is left are yours,

15:25.250 --> 15:27.452
but, uh,
the mortgage is overdue,

15:27.486 --> 15:30.155
and you'll have to sell.

15:30.188 --> 15:31.658
Sell?

15:31.691 --> 15:35.360
That house has been
in our family for generations.

15:35.394 --> 15:37.864
Times change, and besides,
farmland really isn't

15:37.897 --> 15:39.431
worth much these days.

15:39.464 --> 15:41.634
Mattie and Abel,
they've been on that land

15:41.668 --> 15:43.602
all their lives.

15:43.636 --> 15:45.437
Mattie's granddaughter's
with us, and she has

15:45.470 --> 15:47.339
no place to go.

15:47.372 --> 15:50.242
I have no place to go.

15:50.275 --> 15:52.311
No, I wouldn't dream of selling.

15:52.344 --> 15:56.582
Well, unless you've been
stashing money away somewhere.

15:56.615 --> 15:58.617
But, look,

15:58.651 --> 16:00.687
once you've paid off your debts,

16:00.720 --> 16:02.855
I mean,
if you don't live too long,

16:02.889 --> 16:05.157
you'll make do.

16:05.190 --> 16:07.694
Merner Courts would be
your best bet in town.

16:07.727 --> 16:10.228
Merner Courts?

16:10.262 --> 16:11.831
That's a retirement home.

16:13.900 --> 16:16.703
Mr. Lotts, you have a call,
someone important I think.

16:16.736 --> 16:19.639
Well, you've gotta do something,
extend the loan.

16:19.672 --> 16:23.275
Well, the, uh... the bank
only makes loans to men,

16:23.308 --> 16:26.311
and anyway, I really don't think
you'd be a good bet.

16:26.345 --> 16:28.614
I mean, you're 40, am I right?

16:28.648 --> 16:30.616
That is none of your business.

16:30.650 --> 16:32.652
Okay, well, near enough.

16:32.685 --> 16:35.253
Uh, no skills,

16:35.287 --> 16:38.725
no money, no man.

16:38.758 --> 16:40.860
I, uh... I think at this point
in you life, missy,

16:40.893 --> 16:42.527
you need to face facts:

16:42.561 --> 16:44.429
You are retired.

16:47.967 --> 16:49.534
How dare you?

17:20.298 --> 17:21.834
What's the matter, baby?

17:31.010 --> 17:32.712
We're broke.

17:32.745 --> 17:35.715
Tightening-our-belts broke,
or fending-off-the-wolves broke?

17:37.750 --> 17:40.485
- Wolves.
- Mm, mm, mm.

17:44.757 --> 17:47.459
And that scrawny little banker,
he said there's

17:47.492 --> 17:52.497
nothing I can do about it,
so there it is again, I'm...

17:52.531 --> 17:53.933
I'm useless.

17:53.966 --> 17:55.735
Now, you know you ain't useless.

17:55.768 --> 17:57.870
Well, what can she do?

17:57.904 --> 17:59.538
Well, just get another one.

17:59.571 --> 18:01.373
- Another what?
- Man!

18:01.406 --> 18:03.375
I don't want another one!

18:05.812 --> 18:07.312
That's our only option.

18:07.345 --> 18:08.715
Well, what about
the Congressman?

18:08.748 --> 18:10.950
Now, that is a good man,
and, baby, you remember

18:10.983 --> 18:12.919
you was flirtin' with him
when you was too young

18:12.952 --> 18:14.553
to be flirtin'.

18:14.586 --> 18:16.923
And he got
that government money.

18:16.956 --> 18:19.025
That kind don't ever run out.

18:19.058 --> 18:21.794
Ugh, yeah, and he's
a confirmed bachelor.

18:21.828 --> 18:25.631
Oh, God, I'll have
to brush upon my skills.

18:25.665 --> 18:28.533
Jubilee, go get
the judge's address book.

18:28.567 --> 18:30.803
So, you're what, you're gonna
choose one from a book?

18:33.773 --> 18:35.875
No, too old.

18:35.908 --> 18:37.777
- Or dead.
- Uh-uh.

18:37.810 --> 18:39.746
He spits when he speaks.

18:39.779 --> 18:41.814
- Mr. Parker, no.
- No.

18:43.482 --> 18:46.786
We both agree that 14,000 miles
of interstate highway

18:46.819 --> 18:48.654
is an incredible feat.

18:48.688 --> 18:50.622
But, with more funds,

18:50.656 --> 18:53.558
we could be
one nation under God,

18:53.592 --> 18:55.460
connected by asphalt.

18:55.494 --> 18:58.463
Yeah, well before you go patting
yourself on the back just yet,

18:58.497 --> 19:02.668
the Romans built
50,000 miles of road

19:02.702 --> 19:04.569
from sea to shining sea

19:04.603 --> 19:07.506
in 300 BC
without a single bulldozer.

19:07.539 --> 19:09.374
- Really?
- And no constituents

19:09.407 --> 19:11.911
calling to complain
about the cost,

19:11.944 --> 19:14.747
or the dust,
or the offensive billboards

19:14.781 --> 19:17.449
blocking their view
of their lovely hills.

19:19.384 --> 19:21.053
Emanuel Celler, again,

19:21.087 --> 19:25.524
and Alice Paul asking when
you might be available to talk.

19:25.557 --> 19:27.727
I know, the bill.

19:27.760 --> 19:30.863
Damn it, no rest for the weary.

19:30.897 --> 19:33.633
Thank you, Rachel.

19:33.666 --> 19:35.534
Listen, you want my support
for more funding

19:35.567 --> 19:37.703
- for this asphalt river?
- I do.

19:37.737 --> 19:39.872
No more graft.

19:39.906 --> 19:41.573
Clean this thing up,

19:41.606 --> 19:43.109
and give me more exits.

19:43.142 --> 19:45.011
And more fund...

19:46.979 --> 19:49.347
Tell the two of 'em
I'll get back to 'em

19:49.381 --> 19:52.051
just as soon as I'm able.

19:52.084 --> 19:54.720
You are a glutton
for punishment.

19:54.754 --> 19:57.355
I believe the word
is "masochist."

19:59.624 --> 20:01.627
Here you go,
here's your dress and drink.

20:01.661 --> 20:04.997
I made it strong
just the way you like.

20:05.031 --> 20:08.600
- Thank you.
- Mhm.

20:08.634 --> 20:10.703
- Mm.
- Do you still remember

20:10.736 --> 20:12.437
what to do on a date?

20:12.470 --> 20:14.573
Yeah, it's like riding a bike,

20:14.606 --> 20:16.676
and men are only interested
in one thing.

20:16.709 --> 20:18.610
Mm, snatch.

20:18.644 --> 20:21.113
No, I was referring
to their deeper need.

20:21.147 --> 20:24.549
- And what's that?
- Well, to talk about themselves,

20:24.583 --> 20:27.519
or just a sympathetic ear.

20:27.552 --> 20:29.521
I'm not about to be
a sympathetic ear

20:29.554 --> 20:31.724
- for no man.
- Oh, really?

20:31.757 --> 20:33.997
So, what are you gonna do,
you gonna make it on your own,

20:34.026 --> 20:36.095
- Miss Independent?
- Yes.

20:36.128 --> 20:39.165
There I was,
thinking you're a realist.

20:41.901 --> 20:43.468
Here.

20:44.804 --> 20:46.471
Why don't you try some,
try these on.

20:46.504 --> 20:47.807
Let me see you walk.

20:49.775 --> 20:51.552
- Where am I gonna wear these?
- I don't know,

20:51.576 --> 20:54.412
when you go
hootin' and hollerin'.

20:54.446 --> 20:57.783
- Oh no, I am not my mama.
- No, you got more sense.

20:57.817 --> 21:00.820
But you gotta go wild sometime,
you know, dance with abandon.

21:00.853 --> 21:02.889
That's how you dance,
with abandon?

21:02.922 --> 21:04.657
Mm-mm.

21:04.690 --> 21:06.726
I'm not allowed to be that free.

21:11.563 --> 21:13.766
You know, my first drink
that was at the Blue Goose,

21:13.799 --> 21:16.434
Abel waved me in.

21:16.468 --> 21:18.470
I learned two things
that summer:

21:18.503 --> 21:21.506
How to hold my liquor,
and how to dance

21:21.539 --> 21:24.877
like no one was watching.

21:24.911 --> 21:27.213
Oh, what a good time that was.

21:27.246 --> 21:29.614
Oh, I felt so free.

21:32.484 --> 21:35.487
"But now,
I cannot dance upon my toes.

21:35.520 --> 21:38.057
No man has instructed me."

21:38.090 --> 21:39.792
That's Emily Dickinson.

21:39.825 --> 21:41.593
Who's she?

21:41.627 --> 21:44.697
Just another woman
who had to dance backwards.

21:48.600 --> 21:51.170
Right, I'm about to

21:51.203 --> 21:53.839
sell myself
like a pound of meat.

21:55.741 --> 21:57.542
Hm?

21:57.575 --> 21:59.712
Yeah, I think I can
sell myself as prime.

22:01.247 --> 22:03.983
Spode, it's my favorite pattern.

22:04.016 --> 22:06.618
A man with taste, now that's
a great trait to have.

22:06.652 --> 22:08.788
I developed it
on my Italian travels.

22:08.821 --> 22:11.057
My mother lets me out
of her grip every summer.

22:11.090 --> 22:13.960
I go to Rome
for a month of utter bliss.

22:13.993 --> 22:16.195
Rome in the summer,
that's so romantic.

22:16.228 --> 22:19.799
Oh, I'm free to wander
the cafes and shops,

22:19.832 --> 22:22.802
meet all varieties
of interesting people.

22:24.602 --> 22:25.914
Now, a good boy
never kisses and tells,

22:25.938 --> 22:28.774
but, oh,

22:28.808 --> 22:30.676
some of the things I have done.

22:33.713 --> 22:36.282
But, mother's
tight purse strings

22:36.315 --> 22:38.985
pull me right back every time.

22:39.018 --> 22:41.020
She's never found a vice
she could embrace.

22:41.053 --> 22:42.965
The old penny pincher'll
probably have a grip on me

22:42.989 --> 22:45.891
my entire life.

22:45.925 --> 22:48.961
Uh, would you
excuse me a moment?

22:48.995 --> 22:51.230
Oh, Mattie, wrap it up,
one for him,

22:51.263 --> 22:53.032
and one for his mama.

22:53.065 --> 22:56.002
And... get the address book.

22:56.035 --> 22:57.636
All right, baby.

23:02.041 --> 23:04.542
They don't want us around here,
they keep doing their thing.

23:06.712 --> 23:08.156
So, y'all need to get
yourselves in the system

23:08.180 --> 23:10.750
and be registered
so y'all can vote.

23:13.819 --> 23:15.988
Listen to me.

23:17.089 --> 23:18.724
I'm right.

23:18.758 --> 23:20.826
I'm here for you.

23:20.860 --> 23:24.330
Jim Crow's biting me,
and he's biting you.

23:24.363 --> 23:26.699
Now, we should all
be equal under the law.

23:30.236 --> 23:32.038
Come on, y'all.

23:36.008 --> 23:37.877
This high-yellow fella
come down from the North

23:37.910 --> 23:40.112
to help us poor darkies out.

23:41.847 --> 23:43.615
I've come down to get you here

23:43.649 --> 23:46.752
to enlist you in the battle
of your equal rights.

23:46.786 --> 23:48.888
Equal rights?

23:48.921 --> 23:50.866
Abel, what you think about
this whole communist talk

23:50.890 --> 23:53.125
- he talkin' about?
- Just trying to figure out

23:53.159 --> 23:55.593
- what it all means.
- Yeah.

23:55.628 --> 23:57.930
Well, what it means,
Abel, is, uh,

23:57.963 --> 23:59.865
old Peanut here,

23:59.899 --> 24:02.001
he gonna get half
of what's yours,

24:02.034 --> 24:04.103
split down the middle,
share equal.

24:04.136 --> 24:05.905
Nah, nah, nah,
that's not what I mean.

24:05.938 --> 24:08.741
Yeah, Abel,
give me half your bill.

24:08.774 --> 24:10.776
He ain't got shit.

24:10.810 --> 24:13.646
- Lazy ass.
- Yeah, that's what it is, man.

24:13.679 --> 24:15.714
Well, he gonna take half of it.

24:15.748 --> 24:18.017
Not what I'm saying.

24:18.050 --> 24:20.086
See, old whitey here?

24:20.119 --> 24:21.687
He fought
the whole fuckin' world

24:21.720 --> 24:23.621
in World War II
defending this republic.

24:23.656 --> 24:25.133
- Yeah, he did.
- Old whitey's doing a good job

24:25.157 --> 24:27.126
- running things.
- Uh-huh.

24:27.159 --> 24:29.028
Streets are safe.

24:29.061 --> 24:31.397
- You got good-paying jobs.
- Mhm.

24:31.430 --> 24:33.299
And you men sleep
with your windows open.

24:33.332 --> 24:35.734
Now, what other animal lives
under that kind of protection,

24:35.768 --> 24:38.704
- huh?
- I know who you are.

24:38.737 --> 24:40.339
You drive the Congressman,

24:40.372 --> 24:42.384
and you'd like things to stay
exactly the way they are

24:42.408 --> 24:44.743
unless that man
tells you otherwise.

24:44.777 --> 24:46.378
Listen here, yellow boy,

24:46.412 --> 24:49.748
I don't kiss no one's ass,
I'm my own man.

24:49.782 --> 24:52.418
- That's right.
- The way I sees it,

24:52.451 --> 24:55.421
all the men here,
we're doing pretty goddamn fine.

24:55.454 --> 24:59.425
Yeah, you see, old whitey,
he got a plan.

24:59.458 --> 25:03.696
He building a highway
from the sea to shining sea.

25:03.729 --> 25:05.040
That shit's so big
they're gonna call it

25:05.064 --> 25:08.367
- a superhighway.
- Are you content?

25:08.400 --> 25:10.169
Are you content

25:10.202 --> 25:13.706
to pee by the side of that road?

25:13.739 --> 25:15.674
Sleep and eat

25:15.708 --> 25:19.845
where that white man
says your ass can?

25:19.879 --> 25:21.981
Jim Crow's gotta go.

25:22.014 --> 25:23.449
Y'all gotta register yourselves

25:23.482 --> 25:24.926
- and stand up.
- You're just itching to get

25:24.950 --> 25:26.285
your hand on that power stick,

25:26.318 --> 25:28.354
and you ain't got no plan,
yellow boy.

25:28.387 --> 25:30.289
You ain't got no plan.

25:30.322 --> 25:32.324
Mhm.

25:32.358 --> 25:34.693
Call me "yellow boy"
one more time...

25:34.727 --> 25:36.862
- And what?
- Hey!

25:36.896 --> 25:40.132
Hey, y'all gonna spend all night
fighting over about what?

25:40.166 --> 25:41.810
'Cause the only thing
gonna get settled tonight

25:41.834 --> 25:44.103
is who's gonna get
hot and sweaty, right?

25:45.871 --> 25:48.140
You.

25:48.174 --> 25:49.808
- You wanna dance?
- With all that

25:49.842 --> 25:51.443
white blood in him?

25:51.477 --> 25:53.212
He ain't gonna be able
to move much, baby.

25:54.947 --> 25:56.415
Well, you do gotta dance
in our shoes

25:56.448 --> 25:59.485
if you trying to...
trying to preach to us.

26:01.987 --> 26:03.822
Come on now,
I'll give you a dance.

26:05.424 --> 26:07.760
Hey, Abel,
you got some of that, uh...

26:07.793 --> 26:10.429
that good whiskey locked away?

26:10.462 --> 26:13.432
- Sure do.
- All right now.

26:13.465 --> 26:15.834
Break out something
for the boys.

26:15.868 --> 26:17.836
- On me.
- Two, come on, man, for me?

26:17.870 --> 26:20.005
- The lady, too.
- That's what I'm talkin' about.

26:20.039 --> 26:23.008
Now, y'all can't run
from the truth.

26:23.042 --> 26:25.878
You cannot run from the truth.

26:25.911 --> 26:28.314
- Okay.
- Jim Crow is alive and well.

26:28.347 --> 26:31.217
Please, please,
register yourself...

26:31.250 --> 26:33.352
- Okay.
- So you have equal rights.

26:33.385 --> 26:35.087
I hear you, man.

26:47.833 --> 26:49.835
Lord, Lord, Lord.

27:02.314 --> 27:05.784
You'll be all right,
you gonna be all right.

27:05.818 --> 27:08.320
You gonna be all right.

27:21.567 --> 27:24.003
Johnnie, Johnnie on the rocks.

28:39.345 --> 28:41.480
Ooh!

28:41.513 --> 28:44.083
You got back so soon.

28:44.116 --> 28:46.085
Yeah.

28:49.121 --> 28:52.925
That juke joint, like the one
my mama couldn't get enough of.

28:52.958 --> 28:55.094
Women throwing themselves
at men, hoping for something

28:55.127 --> 28:57.262
they ain't gonna get.

28:57.296 --> 28:59.998
Men arguing about
what they want and don't have.

29:00.032 --> 29:02.534
Mhm.

29:02.568 --> 29:04.671
Where do I fit in?

29:07.940 --> 29:09.375
Look up at that sky.

29:09.408 --> 29:12.679
Each one of them stars
shining from its own spot.

29:18.718 --> 29:21.186
He got a plan for us all.

29:31.163 --> 29:34.400
- Come on, now.
- Mommy, Mommy, Mommy!

29:34.433 --> 29:37.369
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy!

29:37.403 --> 29:38.705
- Mommy!
- Wow, are you

29:38.738 --> 29:41.106
feeding them kids good?

29:41.140 --> 29:42.608
Hm?

29:42.642 --> 29:44.552
- The scrawny little mutts.
- I put food on the table

29:44.576 --> 29:47.045
- the best I can.
- Mhm.

29:47.079 --> 29:48.390
You think those men
who gave me them children

29:48.414 --> 29:51.150
sending me money?

29:51.183 --> 29:53.118
I ain't got no steady work.

29:56.422 --> 29:58.390
What you got for me?

29:58.424 --> 30:00.192
Or am I just along for the ride?

30:37.196 --> 30:39.498
Walter.

30:39.531 --> 30:42.234
That boy last night.

30:42.267 --> 30:45.003
He said he's gonna
make us equal.

30:47.740 --> 30:50.075
Not you, baby.

30:50.108 --> 30:52.779
He wasn't talkin' about you.

31:20.506 --> 31:22.241
Hi, Andy.

31:22.274 --> 31:23.509
Hey, how are ya?

31:23.542 --> 31:25.177
Now, let's get this straight.

31:25.210 --> 31:27.680
There's a few more things
to take care of.

31:27.714 --> 31:30.750
So, all right,
have him looking sharp.

31:30.783 --> 31:33.720
Nothing sells better than
a well-dressed underdog.

31:33.753 --> 31:36.723
Trying to win a Pulitzer Prize,
aren't you?

31:36.756 --> 31:38.423
Camera ready,

31:38.457 --> 31:40.225
and no trouble.

31:40.259 --> 31:41.804
Don't you worry about that,
I'll have him singing Dixie

31:41.828 --> 31:46.298
and huggin' their mama,
if it gets us the front page.

31:46.331 --> 31:48.701
In Birmingham today,
police arrested

31:48.735 --> 31:51.436
Martin Luther King,
along with 58 other members

31:51.470 --> 31:54.072
of the Southern...

31:54.106 --> 31:55.583
Every time you turn around
something about some darkie

31:55.607 --> 31:57.242
causing trouble.

31:58.711 --> 32:00.345
NAACP.

32:00.379 --> 32:02.581
SNCC.

32:02.614 --> 32:06.151
Call themselves T-R-O-U-B-L-E,
make it clear.

32:06.184 --> 32:07.720
That is the same car.

32:07.754 --> 32:11.189
I'm tellin' ya, something
is getting ready to go down.

32:11.223 --> 32:12.567
George, ain't nothing
going down around here

32:12.591 --> 32:14.426
except your IQ.

32:14.459 --> 32:17.162
Oh, look at you, getting into
the Cutty Sark already

32:17.195 --> 32:19.598
and The Secret Storm,
haven't even started yet.

32:23.368 --> 32:27.272
Now, tell me about this
fascinating job you have.

32:27.306 --> 32:29.776
Ford automobile's a good value.

32:29.809 --> 32:31.243
Ford don't make anything cheap.

32:31.276 --> 32:33.512
Top of the line,
a Thunderbird V8.

32:33.545 --> 32:35.280
Well, that one's been
a big best seller

32:35.314 --> 32:36.683
for me this year.

32:36.716 --> 32:40.152
Can I get a top-off in here?

32:40.185 --> 32:41.888
Well, let's get to it.

32:41.921 --> 32:45.792
As a rich widow in town,
I know what this all about.

32:45.825 --> 32:47.760
This place is
expensive to keep up.

32:47.794 --> 32:49.528
Needs work.

32:49.561 --> 32:51.196
You need money.

32:51.229 --> 32:54.901
Of course, my dealership
prints it,

32:54.934 --> 32:58.503
long as Ford makes cars
like the Ford Galaxy.

32:58.537 --> 33:00.505
Nothing cheap there.

33:00.539 --> 33:03.609
It's got
a 390-cubic-inch engine.

33:03.643 --> 33:05.577
When that thing roars up,
it's like...

33:08.815 --> 33:10.415
Oh, my Lord, come on.

33:13.385 --> 33:15.554
Come on now,
spit it out, spit it out.

33:20.192 --> 33:22.795
Oh, Lord.

33:22.829 --> 33:25.464
Um, no dessert.

33:31.904 --> 33:34.406
It says, um, that you buy things

33:34.439 --> 33:36.441
that are useful and good.

33:36.475 --> 33:39.177
- That's right, I do.
- Well.

33:41.648 --> 33:43.515
Well.

33:45.317 --> 33:48.420
Say, uh, what does
this little one do?

33:48.453 --> 33:50.923
That's a pickle fork.

33:50.957 --> 33:54.192
It's 1800s,
my great-grandmother's.

33:54.226 --> 33:56.663
Huh! Teresa,
take a look at this.

33:56.696 --> 33:59.331
It's a fork just for a pickle.

34:01.868 --> 34:04.469
Oh, my goodness, a pickle fork.

34:04.503 --> 34:06.739
- Huh.
- And many a fine dinner

34:06.773 --> 34:08.908
it has seen, I'm sure.

34:08.941 --> 34:11.911
Unfortunately, fine dining items
just don't sell anymore.

34:11.944 --> 34:13.913
It's all been replaced
with the TV dinner.

34:13.946 --> 34:15.791
Before you know it, we won't
even be talking to each other.

34:15.815 --> 34:18.450
We'll just be lost
in our appliances.

34:18.483 --> 34:20.385
Amen.

34:20.419 --> 34:22.755
I hope it doesn't come to that.

34:22.789 --> 34:24.556
Gotta go, it's good
to meet you, ma'am.

34:24.589 --> 34:25.925
Good to meet you, too.

34:25.958 --> 34:27.359
- Bye, y'all.
- All right.

34:27.392 --> 34:28.728
Bye.

34:28.761 --> 34:30.930
Ma'am...

34:30.963 --> 34:33.733
I do give cash for diamonds.

34:37.737 --> 34:40.673
The only thing that
good-for-nothing paid for.

34:44.043 --> 34:45.978
That's beautiful,
let's have a look.

34:48.781 --> 34:50.482
Ah, yeah.

34:50.515 --> 34:51.784
Well,

34:51.818 --> 34:55.487
there is
a pretty significant flaw.

34:55.520 --> 34:57.456
How much?

35:01.560 --> 35:03.930
Are you talking to 'em, Walter?

35:03.963 --> 35:05.665
You tellin' 'em all that
pie-in-the-sky,

35:05.698 --> 35:08.500
everybody's-equal poppycrap
is just that?

35:10.302 --> 35:12.270
And things are nice as they are.

35:14.941 --> 35:16.575
I'm talkin' to 'em, boss,
but everybody

35:16.608 --> 35:19.045
don't listen to me, you know?

35:19.078 --> 35:21.346
They say
there's always two sides.

35:21.379 --> 35:23.281
Not always two right sides.

35:26.085 --> 35:27.854
Look out there.

35:33.391 --> 35:35.795
God did bless America.

35:35.828 --> 35:37.930
He really did.

35:47.707 --> 35:49.008
How do I look?

35:51.543 --> 35:53.079
Hm.

35:53.112 --> 35:54.881
Hm, what?

35:54.914 --> 35:57.449
A man ain't gonna buy the cow
when he can drink the milk

35:57.482 --> 35:59.417
- for free.
- I'm just letting him know

35:59.451 --> 36:00.953
that the cow's
still worth milkin'.

36:00.987 --> 36:02.688
Just...

36:02.722 --> 36:04.623
Mm, mm, mm.

36:11.563 --> 36:12.899
Now.

36:16.102 --> 36:20.472
Mm, could do with
a little bit more punch.

36:20.505 --> 36:23.843
Well, bit of valerian,

36:23.876 --> 36:25.945
little pinch of passionflower.

36:25.978 --> 36:29.048
I got it set, right?

36:29.081 --> 36:30.817
Before we use any more
of what we got left,

36:30.850 --> 36:32.685
we better make sure
this is what we want.

36:32.718 --> 36:35.520
Well, Lord, more spice
ain't gonna do no harm.

36:45.932 --> 36:48.701
It looks like we the only ones
at this dinner party.

36:57.609 --> 37:00.445
You come get me out, you hear me
making promises I can't keep.

37:00.478 --> 37:03.448
- Oh, I know the drill.
- How do I look?

37:03.481 --> 37:05.718
Like a man with no self control.

37:16.428 --> 37:18.664
Ladies, ladies,
what is that smell?

37:18.698 --> 37:21.033
Ooh, we're cooking all kinds
of wonderful things for you,

37:21.067 --> 37:23.135
- Congressman.
- Don't be wasting

37:23.169 --> 37:24.904
your fine herbs on me.

37:24.937 --> 37:26.939
I'm already under your spell.

37:26.973 --> 37:28.573
How is she, Mattie?

37:28.607 --> 37:30.676
- Has it been rough?
- She gettin' right along.

37:30.710 --> 37:32.477
Mhm.

37:32.510 --> 37:35.580
Oh, your magic herbs give you
an unfair advantage.

37:35.614 --> 37:37.192
Well, if I'd known
you were gonna be this easy,

37:37.216 --> 37:39.719
I wouldn't have opened
Abel's home brew.

37:39.752 --> 37:42.822
I am this easy, so be gentle.

37:42.855 --> 37:45.523
Look at you,
beautiful as always.

37:45.557 --> 37:48.861
Such a flatterer,
and it isn't even voting time.

37:48.895 --> 37:51.797
That's how you know I mean it.

37:51.831 --> 37:53.574
- How have you been?
- Oh, I don't even wanna think

37:53.598 --> 37:55.968
about that,
but you are the escape.

37:56.002 --> 37:58.204
The delicious escape.

37:58.237 --> 38:01.841
Well, let's, uh, go outside,
and pour ourselves a drink,

38:01.874 --> 38:04.710
and let's talk about
nothing important

38:04.744 --> 38:06.913
- all night long.
- Yes, ma'am.

38:08.814 --> 38:11.951
Jubilee, you take good care
of Walter tonight.

38:11.984 --> 38:14.519
Why I gotta take care of him?

38:14.552 --> 38:16.088
Because I said so.

38:18.556 --> 38:20.159
Thank you kindly, ma'am.

38:20.192 --> 38:21.694
Yes, sir.

38:23.763 --> 38:26.899
Why don't you sit down
and have you something to eat?

38:26.933 --> 38:29.702
How y'all doin', Miss Mattie,
with no man in the house?

38:29.735 --> 38:31.804
Uh, we doin' all right.

38:31.837 --> 38:33.940
How y'all doin'
up there in Washington?

38:33.973 --> 38:36.642
Well, a lot of talking,
but mostly same old grumbling.

38:38.811 --> 38:40.179
Now, who this here, Miss Mattie?

38:40.212 --> 38:42.949
You know her,
that's my grandbaby,

38:42.982 --> 38:44.750
Miss Jubilee Moody.

38:44.784 --> 38:47.920
Well, your grandbaby
sure grown up fast.

38:47.954 --> 38:49.822
I'm not the one up for sale.

38:49.855 --> 38:52.258
You sure?

38:52.291 --> 38:54.459
She's spicy, I like that.

38:56.662 --> 38:58.931
Mhm.

38:58.965 --> 39:01.233
God damn, it tastes so good.

39:12.244 --> 39:13.980
Oh,

39:14.013 --> 39:16.248
even the air out here
smells sweet.

39:20.820 --> 39:22.154
To you, Grace.

39:24.323 --> 39:25.958
To this place.

39:25.992 --> 39:27.693
To this night.

39:27.727 --> 39:28.995
To us.

39:32.164 --> 39:34.266
Mm.

39:34.300 --> 39:35.968
Mm,

39:36.002 --> 39:38.771
my mama used to make
muscadine wine.

39:38.804 --> 39:40.773
And me, an official of the law.

39:40.806 --> 39:42.017
Well, you aren't
gonna turn me in, are you,

39:42.041 --> 39:44.276
- Congressman?
- No, ma'am.

39:44.310 --> 39:46.645
Uh,

39:46.679 --> 39:47.919
you mind if I just help myself?

39:51.616 --> 39:53.551
Muscadine wine.

39:53.585 --> 39:55.321
That's America's grape,

39:55.354 --> 39:57.723
and you know,
every great civilization

39:57.757 --> 40:00.693
needs its own wine.

40:00.726 --> 40:02.237
Miss Mattie, I'm proud
how you're teaching

40:02.261 --> 40:04.663
your grandbaby
how to treat a man.

40:04.697 --> 40:06.198
Woo!

40:06.232 --> 40:08.167
She got some work to do,
though, huh?

40:14.606 --> 40:16.175
Quit studying me.

40:16.208 --> 40:18.878
Ah, you don't want me
to study, huh?

40:18.911 --> 40:20.913
Tell me,

40:20.946 --> 40:22.614
what you want old Walter to do?

40:22.648 --> 40:25.151
Nothing, you only here
'cause you driving the man.

40:25.184 --> 40:27.552
Ouch, come on, girl.

40:32.858 --> 40:34.894
He's eating out of her hand.

40:34.927 --> 40:36.629
I mean, he is actually eating

40:36.662 --> 40:39.632
right out of her hand.

40:39.665 --> 40:42.201
I bet he was droolin'
when he saw this fruit tart.

40:42.234 --> 40:44.103
Big old smile on his face.

40:44.136 --> 40:46.705
Big old stupid grin.

40:46.739 --> 40:50.242
Now, this here is
near the best I ever had.

40:50.276 --> 40:51.710
Near the best?

40:53.813 --> 40:56.148
Well, I'm saving
the category of best

40:56.182 --> 40:58.084
till I taste to know the rest.

40:58.117 --> 41:00.386
Look here,
do you come with this deal?

41:00.419 --> 41:02.655
'Cause we sure could
use the help around here.

41:02.688 --> 41:04.757
That roof leaks, for starts.

41:04.790 --> 41:06.792
Only thing is,

41:06.826 --> 41:08.994
you don't look like
you work much labor.

41:09.028 --> 41:12.098
Miss Mattie, y'all trying
to cut a deal with my man?

41:12.131 --> 41:13.642
Something you need to know
about him, sweet pea,

41:13.666 --> 41:15.000
he a politician.

41:15.034 --> 41:17.837
Now, he can be bought,
but he can't be had.

41:17.870 --> 41:19.905
Lifetime bachelor.

41:19.939 --> 41:22.341
Wanna bet we can't win him?

41:22.374 --> 41:25.311
You got something
worth wagering?

41:25.344 --> 41:27.279
No?

41:27.313 --> 41:29.782
How about a dance then

41:29.815 --> 41:31.884
at the Blue Goose?

41:33.919 --> 41:36.422
What's the matter,
you can dance, can't ya?

41:36.455 --> 41:38.791
Only thing is, I don't think
you'd ever find out.

41:38.824 --> 41:41.127
- You sure?
- Those wide loads of yours

41:41.160 --> 41:42.995
don't look none too graceful.

41:43.028 --> 41:45.164
Well, they know how to get
out of the way of long feet

41:45.197 --> 41:46.765
trying to stomp on 'em.

41:49.034 --> 41:51.170
So, we on?

41:51.203 --> 41:54.740
A dance for me if I get through,
and if, uh...

41:54.773 --> 41:56.909
if you win, well,

41:56.942 --> 42:00.112
I guess you got
your dedicated slave,

42:00.146 --> 42:03.149
and that roof up there
gonna get fixed.

42:03.182 --> 42:05.951
Oh yeah.

42:05.985 --> 42:08.053
- Shake.
- Yes, ma'am...

42:14.293 --> 42:16.228
What you got there, girl?

42:21.333 --> 42:23.002
Cubans.

42:24.737 --> 42:27.273
I suppose after all that trouble
with the Bay of Pigs,

42:27.306 --> 42:30.009
- I should've thrown them out.
- You're right.

42:30.042 --> 42:33.078
Can't let politics stand
in the way of a good cigar.

42:33.112 --> 42:34.980
Excuse me, Miss Gordon.

42:35.014 --> 42:37.116
It's been so nice
around here that

42:37.149 --> 42:39.051
time just done run away with us.

42:39.084 --> 42:40.853
Congressman,
you told me to remind you

42:40.886 --> 42:42.797
about the business you got
at the Capitol in the morning.

42:42.821 --> 42:44.957
- Not yet, Walter.
- Excuse me.

42:46.458 --> 42:48.003
You had too much to drink,
you're starting

42:48.027 --> 42:50.763
to make promises you can't keep.

42:50.796 --> 42:52.898
I suggest we get away
while we can.

42:52.932 --> 42:54.833
- Trust me.
- Yeah.

42:56.302 --> 42:58.103
My apologies, Grace.

42:58.137 --> 43:00.472
Seems the specter
of tomorrow has

43:00.506 --> 43:03.375
abrupted our festivities.

43:03.409 --> 43:06.779
Will I be invited back soon?

43:06.812 --> 43:08.180
I'll check my calendar.

43:10.182 --> 43:13.185
I am holding my breath,
so please,

43:13.219 --> 43:15.187
- don't wait too long.
- Come on now, Congressman.

43:15.221 --> 43:17.189
- All right, I got it, I got it.
- Thank you.

43:17.223 --> 43:18.757
Well, all right.

43:31.937 --> 43:34.273
Ah, that is some good stuff.

43:34.306 --> 43:36.075
You got that right.

43:36.108 --> 43:38.410
That girl Jubilee
ripe for the picking.

43:38.444 --> 43:40.446
There will be
none of that, Walter.

43:40.479 --> 43:42.057
I don't want you
muddying up these waters

43:42.081 --> 43:44.883
with your obsessive desire
to mark your spot.

43:44.917 --> 43:47.353
This gonna be my spot.

43:47.386 --> 43:49.021
I might just throw in the towel.

43:49.054 --> 43:53.359
Retire, let those fine wenches
take care of me.

43:53.392 --> 43:54.860
Retire, you?

43:56.562 --> 43:58.330
That's the wine talkin', boss.

43:58.364 --> 44:01.433
No, I've had an entire lifetime

44:01.467 --> 44:04.570
of managing the world order.

44:04.603 --> 44:07.406
I wanna just

44:07.439 --> 44:09.541
float.

44:09.575 --> 44:11.243
Ain't gonna be
no floatin' around here.

44:11.277 --> 44:14.546
That Jubilee already taking bets
about me doing some roof.

44:14.580 --> 44:15.581
Know what I'm saying?

44:15.614 --> 44:17.249
There's gonna be no retiring.

44:53.285 --> 44:57.389
"All good men

44:57.423 --> 45:00.526
should come to the aid

45:00.559 --> 45:02.161
of their country."

45:04.963 --> 45:08.000
- Oh, God, what's the time?
- 7:30.

45:08.033 --> 45:11.136
- What... what you doing?
- You know, out of 60 ads,

45:11.170 --> 45:13.539
there's only eight for women,
and only one of those

45:13.572 --> 45:15.474
barely applies to me.

45:15.507 --> 45:17.076
What they payin', babe?

45:17.109 --> 45:19.646
Pay dependent on skills.

45:19.679 --> 45:21.947
The plant person
at Sea Graves Trucking...

45:45.070 --> 45:46.639
Hello.

45:46.673 --> 45:48.273
I'm Grace Gordon,
I'm here for the job

45:48.307 --> 45:49.908
of girl Friday.

45:49.942 --> 45:52.945
Here, fill this out.

45:52.978 --> 45:55.080
Over there with them others.

45:55.114 --> 45:56.114
Do you have a pencil?

45:59.451 --> 46:01.253
Thank you.

46:07.626 --> 46:09.428
Yeah, you better get out here.

46:09.461 --> 46:11.964
My office is fillin' up.

46:11.997 --> 46:13.499
Y'all here for the job?

46:13.532 --> 46:15.668
Yes.

46:15.702 --> 46:18.937
My husband's been out of work
for a few months now.

46:18.971 --> 46:22.408
We got two kids, and...

46:22.441 --> 46:25.678
we're staying with
his sister's family.

46:25.712 --> 46:28.480
I gotta get out of there
before they drive me crazy.

46:30.449 --> 46:32.951
My mother can't work no more.

46:32.985 --> 46:34.553
I'm supportin' us both.

46:36.355 --> 46:37.657
What you here for?

46:37.690 --> 46:39.992
Extra spending money?

46:40.025 --> 46:41.493
No.

46:41.527 --> 46:43.562
I'm also here for my family.

46:46.999 --> 46:49.968
Okay, what we got here?

46:50.002 --> 46:52.304
All right, uh, May Jones.

46:52.337 --> 46:54.540
Yes, sir, I'm May Jones.

46:56.375 --> 46:57.744
Can you type, honey?

46:57.777 --> 46:59.411
Yes, sir,

46:59.445 --> 47:01.146
a little.

47:01.180 --> 47:02.682
But, if you hire me,

47:02.715 --> 47:06.084
I bet I can do just about
anything you ask me to do.

47:08.020 --> 47:10.989
Ooh, that's the kind of answer
I like to hear.

47:11.023 --> 47:12.692
All right, uh,

47:12.725 --> 47:14.993
Nell Brown.

47:17.095 --> 47:18.698
Mm.

47:18.731 --> 47:22.301
Uh, see here you got experience.

47:22.334 --> 47:24.203
Type 100 words a minute?

47:24.236 --> 47:27.072
Yes, sir, I take shorthand, sir,

47:27.105 --> 47:29.308
and if you need, sir,
do your accountant work,

47:29.341 --> 47:30.576
too, sir.

47:30.609 --> 47:32.444
Hm.

47:35.514 --> 47:37.616
And you.

47:41.353 --> 47:43.288
Grace Gordon.

47:43.322 --> 47:45.591
- Yes, sir, that's right.
- You graduated

47:45.624 --> 47:47.392
from Hollins College

47:47.426 --> 47:51.129
with a degree in...
19th century poetry?

47:51.163 --> 47:53.766
- Yes, and I also have...
- Married?

47:53.800 --> 47:56.168
- Divorced.
- Hm.

47:56.201 --> 47:59.338
And I also type,
not as quickly as these ladies,

47:59.371 --> 48:02.374
but if I'm given the job,
I can certainly help this place

48:02.407 --> 48:04.343
look less like a...

48:04.376 --> 48:07.546
like a truck stop.

48:07.579 --> 48:10.048
As the adage goes,

48:10.082 --> 48:11.550
"A man is judged
by his appearance,"

48:11.583 --> 48:14.620
and I can certainly
help with that.

48:14.654 --> 48:16.723
Hm, divorced?

48:18.490 --> 48:21.527
Okay, let's have
a quick turn around, girls.

48:23.128 --> 48:24.664
All right,
lift skirts a little bit.

48:30.335 --> 48:31.771
Are we applying
for the chorus line

48:31.804 --> 48:34.106
or a secretarial job?

48:34.139 --> 48:36.542
Everything must be appealing,
didn't ya say?

48:38.577 --> 48:40.345
Let's go in the back,
honey, come on,

48:40.379 --> 48:42.139
let's go know each other
a little bit better.

48:44.182 --> 48:45.617
Oh!

48:48.186 --> 48:50.455
Well.

48:50.489 --> 48:52.190
I guess the interview is over.

48:52.224 --> 48:55.527
Yeah, I think he got
all he needed to know.

48:55.561 --> 48:57.095
I'm too ugly,

48:57.129 --> 49:01.166
and you're too bossy.

49:08.373 --> 49:10.242
This is The Secret Storm,

49:10.275 --> 49:11.811
brought to you by Dristan.

49:13.746 --> 49:16.649
The measure of our leadership
is in rebuilt inventories,

49:16.683 --> 49:19.484
increased production
all along the line.

49:19.518 --> 49:21.386
The measure of our leadership

49:21.420 --> 49:23.322
is the measure of the future.

49:27.426 --> 49:29.494
When'd you get this?

49:29.528 --> 49:31.664
Brought it in a few days ago.

49:31.698 --> 49:33.565
Mrs. Grace Gordon

49:33.599 --> 49:35.133
came in proud as you please.

49:35.167 --> 49:36.736
That belonged
to her grandmother.

49:36.769 --> 49:38.671
- Hm.
- Can you just imagine

49:38.705 --> 49:40.572
all those society evenings?

49:40.606 --> 49:42.809
- That's fancy.
- Well, did you know

49:42.842 --> 49:45.277
she lived in Paris, France,
for a while?

49:45.310 --> 49:46.679
Hm.

49:46.713 --> 49:49.581
She must be hard up for money.

49:49.615 --> 49:51.550
It's the same car,

49:51.583 --> 49:52.861
the one with
the New York plates.

49:52.885 --> 49:54.787
I'm tellin' ya,
something is goin' on.

49:54.821 --> 49:56.555
Sure, George.

49:56.588 --> 49:58.499
Probably Time magazine
come all the way down here

49:58.523 --> 50:00.760
to report on paint drying.

50:00.793 --> 50:03.863
- Where?
- Right there, the black sedan.

50:03.896 --> 50:05.376
- That one right there?
- Right there.

50:06.966 --> 50:08.901
- Hello.
- Oh!

50:08.935 --> 50:10.937
Well, look at you,
fresh as a daisy.

50:10.970 --> 50:12.705
We were just talkin'
about your valuables.

50:12.739 --> 50:15.607
Oh, was anything sold?

50:15.642 --> 50:18.276
Well, no, not yet.

50:18.310 --> 50:20.245
All right, well.

50:20.278 --> 50:21.914
Whoops, better get back to work.

50:21.948 --> 50:23.850
I am in need
of a little more money

50:23.883 --> 50:26.753
for something special
I'm working on,

50:26.786 --> 50:29.689
and I wonder how much
I could get for these.

50:29.722 --> 50:32.224
I mean,
it's costume jewelry, but,

50:32.257 --> 50:34.661
- anything?
- Well...

50:36.528 --> 50:37.797
these are very beautiful.

50:39.398 --> 50:42.735
Wish I had someone
to give 'em to.

50:42.769 --> 50:44.278
You know, Dick, you should
buy something like this

50:44.302 --> 50:45.905
for your wife.

50:45.938 --> 50:48.908
- Do something nice.
- Why?

50:48.941 --> 50:52.344
She ain't give me
nothing but a hard time.

50:52.377 --> 50:55.280
Well, that's no way to be.

50:55.313 --> 50:58.718
I can loan you $35 to $40
for the lot.

51:02.021 --> 51:05.792
You know, I was thinkin'
about you the other day.

51:05.825 --> 51:07.794
Here's, uh...

51:11.831 --> 51:14.466
Have a look at this here paper.

51:14.499 --> 51:16.501
It says, uh,

51:16.535 --> 51:18.403
"Make the world
a beautiful place,

51:18.437 --> 51:20.238
and make money doing it.

51:20.272 --> 51:21.841
Avon is coming to your area,

51:21.874 --> 51:26.012
and there's
new territory for sale."

51:26.045 --> 51:28.380
Maybe this is for you.

51:32.517 --> 51:35.253
Door-to-door sales?

51:36.923 --> 51:40.727
Honey, 60-day loans
roll around real fast.

51:45.363 --> 51:48.835
Yeah, and I may have managed
to stage a narrow escape.

51:48.868 --> 51:50.703
We'll see.

51:53.572 --> 51:56.008
- Right there.
- Well, I didn't count on that.

51:56.042 --> 51:59.311
Well, I'm guessing you will.

51:59.344 --> 52:02.614
I can do this here.

52:02.648 --> 52:04.349
What do you think of that?

52:04.382 --> 52:07.053
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, Congressman,

52:07.086 --> 52:10.723
I can see you're up to
your same old tricks.

52:10.757 --> 52:13.458
I might have one or two
left in the bag.

52:16.796 --> 52:19.598
- I can say...
- Oh, well, just say it.

52:21.399 --> 52:24.070
I win.

52:24.103 --> 52:26.571
Congratulations, Earl.

52:26.605 --> 52:27.916
Yeah, I think this is
the first time

52:27.940 --> 52:29.709
in two or three years
you beat me, well,

52:29.742 --> 52:31.576
well done, well done, my friend.

52:31.610 --> 52:33.445
All right, Tiny.

52:33.478 --> 52:35.648
That is my last four bits.

52:35.681 --> 52:36.949
Robbery.

52:36.983 --> 52:38.426
You know, you should be
ashamed of yourself

52:38.450 --> 52:40.352
treating your congressman
like this.

52:40.385 --> 52:41.854
I gotta go, boys,
I got work to do,

52:41.888 --> 52:43.890
but I wanted to give you
a little something here.

52:43.923 --> 52:45.390
All right.

52:45.423 --> 52:46.692
Here it is.

52:48.895 --> 52:51.363
Tell 'em to have
a look at this here.

52:51.396 --> 52:52.832
Oh yeah.

52:52.865 --> 52:55.868
A little gift for you, boys.

52:55.902 --> 52:58.738
Niggas got bones
in their nose in Africa.

53:00.539 --> 53:02.440
God bless America, huh?

53:02.474 --> 53:04.744
- Congratulations.
- Bones in our noses

53:04.777 --> 53:07.345
and wings on our backs.

53:10.582 --> 53:14.053
Now, boys, aren't y'all tired
of being excluded?

53:14.086 --> 53:16.421
Huh? We gotta
register ourselves.

53:16.454 --> 53:17.256
We gotta be in the system.

53:17.290 --> 53:19.524
We gotta be...
we gotta be counted.

53:27.800 --> 53:29.635
Get out of here.

53:29.669 --> 53:30.468
You all right?

53:30.502 --> 53:32.370
- Watch your head.
- That's crazy.

53:32.404 --> 53:34.606
Don't come around here.

53:34.640 --> 53:38.144
âª If that mockingbird
won't sing âª

53:38.177 --> 53:41.981
âª Mama's gonna buy you
a diamond ring âª

54:10.643 --> 54:11.643
Avon.

54:15.014 --> 54:17.049
Hello? Avon.

54:29.195 --> 54:30.763
Hello? Avon.

54:38.037 --> 54:39.772
Avon calling.

54:39.805 --> 54:42.540
Here to make your day
more beautiful.

54:42.574 --> 54:44.844
My man don't allow
nobody on his property.

54:44.877 --> 54:47.747
I'm not here for him.

54:47.780 --> 54:50.116
I'm here for you
and I got products.

54:50.149 --> 54:52.852
Ma'am, I ain't got no money.

54:59.225 --> 55:01.626
You're a beekeeper?

55:01.661 --> 55:02.962
Yes, ma'am.

55:02.995 --> 55:04.730
Well, that's beautiful.

55:04.764 --> 55:06.198
I always wanted
to be a beekeeper.

55:09.601 --> 55:11.203
You don't want no run-in
with him.

55:11.237 --> 55:12.238
Please go.

55:12.271 --> 55:14.106
Who is that on my property?

55:14.140 --> 55:15.607
Um...

55:15.641 --> 55:17.143
Well, I'm here to see your wife.

55:17.176 --> 55:21.647
Um, see if she's interested
in some products.

55:21.681 --> 55:22.801
Well, she ain't go no money.

55:23.816 --> 55:24.951
So get.

55:26.919 --> 55:28.821
Go on now. Get on out of here.

55:36.629 --> 55:38.230
A girl should always have
mad money.

55:41.634 --> 55:43.002
Every lady always needs honey.

55:44.270 --> 55:45.537
I said get, bitch.

56:06.225 --> 56:07.525
- Woo!
- I got her!

56:07.559 --> 56:09.261
I got her, I got her!

56:09.295 --> 56:11.263
What? Help!

56:11.297 --> 56:12.732
What? Help!

56:12.765 --> 56:13.866
Good God Almighty, boys.

56:13.899 --> 56:15.634
What have y'all done?

56:15.668 --> 56:17.003
You from the truants' office?

56:17.036 --> 56:18.180
I told them boys
to get to school,

56:18.204 --> 56:19.805
but they don't mind me.

56:19.839 --> 56:21.040
No, I'm Avon.

56:21.073 --> 56:23.541
I'm here to make
your day more beautiful.

56:23.575 --> 56:24.653
Reading, writing, and 'rithmetic

56:24.677 --> 56:25.978
don't mean shit if all they do

56:26.012 --> 56:27.313
is produce heathens.

56:27.346 --> 56:28.447
Manners.

56:28.481 --> 56:30.850
That's what they need
to be teachin' in schools.

56:30.883 --> 56:32.952
These heathens
are your next citizens.

56:32.985 --> 56:34.754
Yes, you have a point.

56:34.787 --> 56:36.822
I'm not from
the truants' office.

56:36.856 --> 56:39.158
Can you get your boy off of me?

56:39.191 --> 56:41.559
Leave that woman alone
and act right for once.

56:41.593 --> 56:42.962
Not until you call uncle.

56:42.995 --> 56:45.031
Let go of whoever
you've got this instant,

56:45.064 --> 56:47.166
Bobby Jo, you hear me?

56:48.300 --> 56:49.300
You hurt?

56:50.302 --> 56:51.871
A little.

56:51.904 --> 56:54.707
It's you, from the bank.

56:54.740 --> 56:56.742
Miss Grace Gordon.

56:56.776 --> 56:59.178
I'm Ruth, remember?

56:59.211 --> 57:00.179
Yes.

57:00.212 --> 57:02.181
If you don't mind me askin',

57:02.214 --> 57:04.250
what in the name
of Sam Hill are you doin' here

57:04.283 --> 57:05.284
on this side of town?

57:05.317 --> 57:07.253
Avon, here to make your day
more beautiful.

57:07.286 --> 57:10.356
But I'm... I'm not doing
a very good job.

57:10.389 --> 57:12.590
Avon?

57:12.624 --> 57:14.927
To this neighborhood?

57:14.960 --> 57:18.164
Well, you landed
in the right place now.

57:18.197 --> 57:20.699
Come on,
I'll get you cleaned up.

57:20.733 --> 57:22.034
Thank you.

57:24.637 --> 57:25.871
Golly.

57:25.905 --> 57:27.373
Now you don't mind, do you, uh,

57:27.406 --> 57:30.810
comin' in, I mean,
and gettin' somethin' to drink?

57:30.843 --> 57:32.845
Do you have bourbon?

57:32.878 --> 57:34.246
Why, yes, ma'am, we sure do.

57:34.280 --> 57:36.082
Then I'd be delighted.

57:39.752 --> 57:41.687
Girls, we got a caller.

57:41.720 --> 57:43.689
Things gonna make you
even more beautiful.

57:43.722 --> 57:45.124
Come look.

57:48.427 --> 57:50.696
Miss Effie, we got Avon.

57:50.729 --> 57:51.729
Huh?

57:53.365 --> 57:55.067
Girls.

57:55.101 --> 57:56.769
Avon.

57:56.802 --> 57:58.237
Straighten up.

58:04.677 --> 58:07.046
- Here you go, Miss Grace.
- Thank you.

58:07.079 --> 58:08.156
You got a room
full of ready customers,

58:08.180 --> 58:10.015
don't she, girls?

58:10.049 --> 58:12.685
Everyone, this is my friend,
Miss Grace Gordon.

58:12.718 --> 58:14.820
And she's here
with some nice things.

58:16.222 --> 58:18.958
- Well, um...
- That's right, baby doll.

58:18.991 --> 58:21.327
This is a hootchie-cootchie
titty house.

58:21.360 --> 58:22.795
Queenie, stop it.

58:22.828 --> 58:25.798
Miss Grace, money don't know
no prejudice,

58:25.831 --> 58:28.367
and we're workin' girls
that got money.

58:30.703 --> 58:32.037
Well, that's right.

58:35.207 --> 58:36.842
Well, all right, come on.

58:36.876 --> 58:38.644
Right this way.

58:42.982 --> 58:44.884
I have some very nice items.

58:44.917 --> 58:46.452
Honey, we ain't lookin'
for nice.

58:46.485 --> 58:48.120
Come on.

58:48.154 --> 58:50.923
Look at this.

58:50.956 --> 58:53.025
Scheherazade's Arabian Nights.

58:53.058 --> 58:54.860
Now don't that sound exotic?

58:54.894 --> 58:56.729
Shoot, sounds hot to me.

58:56.762 --> 58:57.897
And expensive.

58:57.930 --> 58:58.998
You're cheap, Queenie.

58:59.031 --> 59:01.901
Bet you got the first dollar
you ever got laid for.

59:01.934 --> 59:04.370
Don't you worry
'bout what I got.

59:04.403 --> 59:07.339
You got anything to cover this
in that bag of tricks?

59:07.373 --> 59:08.373
Here.

59:09.775 --> 59:11.911
Did someone hit you?

59:11.944 --> 59:12.954
Some people think hurtin' you

59:12.978 --> 59:15.247
comes with the price
of the ride.

59:15.281 --> 59:16.415
It's okay.

59:16.448 --> 59:18.484
Miss Effie keeps a gun.

59:18.517 --> 59:19.952
Scheherazade.

59:19.985 --> 59:21.787
Who was she to get a perfume
named after her?

59:24.390 --> 59:26.859
It's Scheherazade.

59:26.892 --> 59:29.828
Now, let me tell you about her.

59:29.862 --> 59:33.732
See, in a far away land,
there was a king.

59:33.766 --> 59:37.069
And each night, he chose a wife.

59:37.102 --> 59:39.438
And every day, he beheaded her.

59:39.471 --> 59:40.506
You know why?

59:40.539 --> 59:42.975
'Cause he didn't want her
to be unfaithful.

59:43.008 --> 59:45.144
But when Scheherazade
was chosen,

59:45.177 --> 59:47.046
she outsmarted him.

59:47.079 --> 59:50.182
She spun a tale
that was so intriguin'

59:50.216 --> 59:51.984
that the king kept her alive

59:52.017 --> 59:55.321
for 1,001 nights
just to hear more.

59:55.354 --> 59:59.225
And then she became his queen.

59:59.258 --> 1:00:02.161
This day started off
just like any other regular day

1:00:02.194 --> 1:00:04.463
and then you dropped in
and made it magic.

1:00:04.496 --> 1:00:07.032
No, you've been the one
doin' all the sellin'.

1:00:07.066 --> 1:00:08.200
You'd be good at sales.

1:00:08.234 --> 1:00:11.937
No, no one's gonna hire
an uneducated hillbilly like me.

1:00:11.971 --> 1:00:14.039
Nah, I gotta play to my assets.

1:00:14.073 --> 1:00:16.342
Plus, I got a little girl
to take care of.

1:00:16.375 --> 1:00:18.177
I'm gonna make sure
she's educated.

1:00:18.210 --> 1:00:20.813
She's gonna be
a fine lady like you.

1:00:20.846 --> 1:00:22.381
All right, girls.

1:00:22.414 --> 1:00:24.416
Tea party's over.

1:00:24.450 --> 1:00:25.884
Ruth, Bay Bay,

1:00:25.918 --> 1:00:28.120
you're on the window tonight.

1:00:28.153 --> 1:00:31.924
It's a two-drink minimum,
on top no matter.

1:00:31.957 --> 1:00:33.392
Come on, get a move on.

1:00:36.962 --> 1:00:38.964
I hope our paths cross again.

1:00:38.998 --> 1:00:42.401
I won't speak up or nothin',
just smile,

1:00:42.434 --> 1:00:44.436
if you won't mind it.

1:00:44.470 --> 1:00:45.838
Of course.

1:00:45.871 --> 1:00:47.439
Honey, you got your order ready.

1:00:47.473 --> 1:00:48.540
You need to pack it up.

1:00:48.574 --> 1:00:50.576
We got business.

1:00:50.609 --> 1:00:51.609
Yeah.

1:00:52.611 --> 1:00:53.611
All right.

1:00:56.181 --> 1:00:58.350
What did y'all learn
at school today?

1:00:58.384 --> 1:00:59.918
Wow.

1:01:03.188 --> 1:01:06.959
A, B, C,

1:01:06.992 --> 1:01:09.995
D, E, F, G.

1:01:12.498 --> 1:01:13.332
$6.70,

1:01:13.365 --> 1:01:18.337
and then two Skin So Softs
at $5.78.

1:01:20.205 --> 1:01:23.242
$20.03.

1:01:23.275 --> 1:01:24.977
Easy money.

1:01:26.445 --> 1:01:29.381
Sorry, did you just do that
in your head?

1:01:29.415 --> 1:01:31.617
Got a head for figures, I guess.

1:01:31.651 --> 1:01:33.085
Yes, you have.

1:01:34.153 --> 1:01:35.120
And for sellin'.

1:01:35.154 --> 1:01:37.289
You should do somethin'.

1:01:37.323 --> 1:01:40.426
Somethin' better than this.

1:01:40.459 --> 1:01:42.227
Better?

1:01:44.463 --> 1:01:46.065
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to be rude.

1:01:46.098 --> 1:01:48.267
It's just that... you could.

1:01:48.300 --> 1:01:52.104
You're... useful.

1:01:52.137 --> 1:01:53.972
This ain't no regular life
for you,

1:01:54.006 --> 1:01:58.577
but I was born
on the wrong side of the tracks.

1:01:58.610 --> 1:02:01.180
Ain't got no education
to speak of.

1:02:02.481 --> 1:02:04.516
But I'm a saver.

1:02:07.353 --> 1:02:09.656
Baby, you're gonna miss
the start of your show.

1:02:09.689 --> 1:02:12.024
- Okay.
- Go on, get your study books.

1:02:15.494 --> 1:02:17.296
- Bye.
- Bye.

1:02:22.167 --> 1:02:23.602
Well?

1:02:23.636 --> 1:02:25.270
How do I look?

1:02:25.304 --> 1:02:26.505
I look all right?

1:02:27.606 --> 1:02:28.675
Yeah.

1:02:38.117 --> 1:02:39.184
All right.

1:02:44.623 --> 1:02:46.392
For your future.

1:03:57.596 --> 1:03:59.998
Which one of these
you want to use tonight?

1:04:00.032 --> 1:04:02.601
Which one makes me look thinner?

1:04:02.635 --> 1:04:05.638
You ask a lot of these jackets,
Congressman.

1:04:05.672 --> 1:04:09.241
The art of flattery
will only assist you, Walter.

1:04:09.274 --> 1:04:10.509
You gonna stay the night?

1:04:10.542 --> 1:04:12.444
Up to the lady, of course.

1:04:12.478 --> 1:04:16.381
I do believe I have won my way
into her good graces.

1:04:16.415 --> 1:04:18.250
Congressman,
don't get all caught up.

1:04:18.283 --> 1:04:19.527
This woman is used
to nothing but high living.

1:04:19.551 --> 1:04:21.320
There's a lot of work
to do over there.

1:04:21.353 --> 1:04:23.355
Walter, I've been
playing this game

1:04:23.388 --> 1:04:26.158
since before you were a gleam
in your father's prick.

1:04:29.628 --> 1:04:31.196
No tie.

1:04:31.230 --> 1:04:32.699
Yes, sir.

1:04:48.815 --> 1:04:50.750
Mattie?

1:04:50.783 --> 1:04:51.784
Jubilee?

1:04:51.818 --> 1:04:53.686
We in here.

1:04:53.720 --> 1:04:55.521
All right, what's goin' on?

1:04:55.554 --> 1:04:57.489
The man done turned us off.

1:04:57.523 --> 1:05:00.459
He said they're a power company
not a charity business.

1:05:00.492 --> 1:05:02.394
Oh my God, what else can happen?

1:05:02.427 --> 1:05:05.264
Congressman called,
said he was ridin' into town

1:05:05.297 --> 1:05:08.200
and said we sure would be
a good sight to see

1:05:08.233 --> 1:05:09.334
if we wasn't doin' nothin'.

1:05:09.368 --> 1:05:10.402
With no electricity?

1:05:10.435 --> 1:05:12.504
Please do not tell me
that you invited him over.

1:05:12.538 --> 1:05:15.274
We've got to close
this deal tonight, baby.

1:05:15.307 --> 1:05:16.709
We in the dark.

1:05:16.743 --> 1:05:18.544
After the day I've had.

1:05:20.847 --> 1:05:22.614
How am I gonna pull that off?

1:05:27.586 --> 1:05:29.121
I'm glad to be goin' some place

1:05:29.154 --> 1:05:31.323
where there's not a care
in the world.

1:05:31.356 --> 1:05:32.825
- Yes, sir.
- And one of God's

1:05:32.859 --> 1:05:34.694
sweetest creatures
is gonna be treatin' me

1:05:34.727 --> 1:05:36.663
like I'm all that matters.

1:05:38.898 --> 1:05:41.533
Oh, Lord.

1:05:41.567 --> 1:05:43.135
What's goin' on?

1:05:43.168 --> 1:05:44.445
They sent one of them
rabble-rousers down here

1:05:44.469 --> 1:05:45.504
to stir things up.

1:05:45.537 --> 1:05:47.640
- Rabble-rouser?
- Yes, sir.

1:05:47.674 --> 1:05:50.151
Is that one of King's men or one
of those crazies from Chicago?

1:05:50.175 --> 1:05:53.111
One of King's men,
and a commie reporter too.

1:05:53.145 --> 1:05:55.113
Dammit. Streets are safe.

1:05:55.147 --> 1:05:56.615
Plenty of jobs.

1:05:56.649 --> 1:05:58.651
I'd say we've created
a kind of utopia.

1:05:58.685 --> 1:06:00.452
I wouldn't go that far.

1:06:01.654 --> 1:06:04.156
What did you say, Walter?

1:06:04.189 --> 1:06:06.191
Look at you, hm?

1:06:07.426 --> 1:06:08.627
Driving a Cadillac,

1:06:08.661 --> 1:06:10.495
getting all the snatch
you can handle.

1:06:10.529 --> 1:06:12.699
Hm? Back seat.

1:06:13.933 --> 1:06:16.335
You've had your fair share
of the pie in your day too.

1:06:16.368 --> 1:06:17.502
My day?

1:06:18.537 --> 1:06:20.138
This is still my day.

1:06:22.341 --> 1:06:25.444
My forefathers
wrote the Magna Carta

1:06:25.477 --> 1:06:27.847
and the Constitution
and the Boy Scout manual,

1:06:27.880 --> 1:06:29.816
three of the finest documents
ever written.

1:06:29.849 --> 1:06:32.417
And I'm still writin'
damn good law.

1:06:32.451 --> 1:06:34.687
Only thing
missing today is gratitude.

1:06:36.288 --> 1:06:38.457
Congressman, they just sayin'

1:06:38.490 --> 1:06:40.559
why can't a negro man
eat where he wants?

1:06:41.728 --> 1:06:44.363
Drink from the same fountain,
piss in the same pot?

1:06:45.798 --> 1:06:48.233
What's that all about, huh?

1:06:48.266 --> 1:06:51.938
Hell, Walter, let's just get
to where there's no trouble

1:06:51.971 --> 1:06:54.373
and no talk of change.

1:07:07.452 --> 1:07:09.354
Hm, hm, hm.

1:07:09.388 --> 1:07:10.522
Now what's this all about?

1:07:10.555 --> 1:07:12.424
What the hell?

1:07:21.834 --> 1:07:23.502
Y'all blown a fuse?

1:07:23.535 --> 1:07:25.404
Welcome!

1:07:25.437 --> 1:07:27.439
Well, what have we here?

1:07:27.472 --> 1:07:29.207
Scheherazade awaits.

1:07:29.241 --> 1:07:30.342
Follow me.

1:07:30.375 --> 1:07:32.377
Boss, be careful,
this looks like a trap.

1:07:33.512 --> 1:07:34.881
Lead the way, my sweet.

1:07:34.914 --> 1:07:36.381
Mm.

1:07:36.415 --> 1:07:37.850
Lead me away.

1:07:45.590 --> 1:07:47.727
Jubilee, Jubilee.

1:07:47.760 --> 1:07:48.828
Shut up.

1:07:56.636 --> 1:07:58.537
Grace.

1:07:58.570 --> 1:08:00.572
My Grace.

1:08:00.605 --> 1:08:02.975
What do you have on your mind?

1:08:03.009 --> 1:08:05.011
And will I live up
to the challenge?

1:08:07.412 --> 1:08:09.581
Well, I think
you'll manage just fine.

1:08:10.983 --> 1:08:13.418
Come curl up under.

1:08:13.452 --> 1:08:14.921
Let's enjoy the world.

1:08:15.955 --> 1:08:17.724
Sounds like a perfect plan.

1:08:26.966 --> 1:08:28.835
They say we're movin'
a thousand miles an hour

1:08:28.868 --> 1:08:30.870
through space.

1:08:30.903 --> 1:08:33.840
Yet down here it feels like
we sittin' still.

1:08:33.873 --> 1:08:34.941
Mm-hm.

1:08:36.374 --> 1:08:37.509
Yeah.

1:08:39.377 --> 1:08:42.447
This is all just an illusion,
really, isn't it?

1:08:42.481 --> 1:08:43.959
See, when I was young,
I used to see those lights

1:08:43.983 --> 1:08:45.017
in the distance.

1:08:45.051 --> 1:08:47.352
They'd sparkle like diamonds
and I thought...

1:08:49.621 --> 1:08:52.457
I was curious
to see what they were.

1:08:52.491 --> 1:08:55.061
After all of your travels,
you finally found that

1:08:55.094 --> 1:08:56.863
there's no place like home.

1:08:58.597 --> 1:08:59.732
Mm.

1:09:03.970 --> 1:09:04.970
Come on.

1:09:05.972 --> 1:09:06.972
What?

1:09:08.406 --> 1:09:10.442
Let's swim in the moonlight.

1:09:14.013 --> 1:09:15.782
Come on.

1:09:15.815 --> 1:09:17.817
I double-dare you.

1:09:17.850 --> 1:09:19.351
Beautiful.

1:09:20.619 --> 1:09:21.921
Oh, God.

1:09:24.891 --> 1:09:26.324
Oh my God.

1:09:26.358 --> 1:09:28.828
All right, oh...

1:09:28.861 --> 1:09:29.929
Geronimo!

1:09:35.067 --> 1:09:36.636
God dammit!

1:09:36.669 --> 1:09:37.670
I'm comin'.

1:09:59.558 --> 1:10:01.093
Whilst he...

1:10:01.127 --> 1:10:04.396
Who truly took it from them...

1:10:04.429 --> 1:10:06.632
I'm readin'!

1:10:06.666 --> 1:10:08.043
- You don't like me readin'?
- I'm listenin'.

1:10:08.067 --> 1:10:09.068
Huh?

1:10:12.437 --> 1:10:13.715
You look damn fine, little girl.

1:10:13.739 --> 1:10:14.573
Go on.

1:10:14.606 --> 1:10:16.441
Go on, back it up
in that chair now.

1:10:16.474 --> 1:10:17.810
Ooh!

1:10:17.844 --> 1:10:18.811
I'm gonna go get me
another drink.

1:10:18.845 --> 1:10:19.845
I'll be back.

1:10:23.983 --> 1:10:25.483
My man.

1:10:27.687 --> 1:10:28.654
Good night, right?

1:10:28.688 --> 1:10:29.789
Yeah. Say, Walter...

1:10:31.489 --> 1:10:32.424
Walter.

1:10:32.457 --> 1:10:35.094
I need your man
to send around a cruiser.

1:10:35.127 --> 1:10:36.028
What's going on?

1:10:36.062 --> 1:10:38.530
Uh, white trash
I've never seen before

1:10:38.563 --> 1:10:40.599
been ridin' by whoopin' it up.

1:10:41.499 --> 1:10:43.903
I feel like combustion
is on its way.

1:10:45.771 --> 1:10:47.439
- I'll talk to him.
- All right.

1:10:51.143 --> 1:10:52.778
Well, well, well.

1:10:52.812 --> 1:10:54.613
If it ain't
Mr. Rabble-rouser himself.

1:10:54.647 --> 1:10:55.580
How you doin', sir?

1:10:55.614 --> 1:10:58.918
Abel, set this man up
a drink here on me.

1:10:58.951 --> 1:11:01.586
Ah, I'll take a shot of Johnnie,

1:11:01.620 --> 1:11:05.523
and I'll buy it myself,
all right?

1:11:05.557 --> 1:11:08.728
- I don't need...
- Well, come on now, brother.

1:11:08.761 --> 1:11:10.595
Just trying to be hospitable.

1:11:10.630 --> 1:11:11.630
Oh.

1:11:12.632 --> 1:11:13.766
Trying to set me up, huh?

1:11:13.799 --> 1:11:15.201
- That's all you, baby.
- Hm.

1:11:15.234 --> 1:11:16.802
Come on, pretty boy.

1:11:16.836 --> 1:11:19.138
- Uh-uh.
- Dance with me.

1:11:19.171 --> 1:11:22.474
Show old Viola how you move.

1:11:22.507 --> 1:11:24.043
Careful with our V.

1:11:24.076 --> 1:11:25.610
She might bite.

1:11:25.645 --> 1:11:26.965
- Very good.
- Mind your business.

1:11:30.216 --> 1:11:32.517
Look what we have here.

1:11:32.550 --> 1:11:33.819
Let me get a water.

1:11:40.760 --> 1:11:42.228
Hello.

1:11:42.261 --> 1:11:43.229
Hey.

1:11:43.262 --> 1:11:44.230
How you doin'?

1:11:44.263 --> 1:11:45.698
Fine.

1:11:46.832 --> 1:11:47.943
Abel, give her a real drink.

1:11:47.967 --> 1:11:51.103
No. Water's fine.

1:11:51.137 --> 1:11:54.774
I suppose that you came
to dance with old Walter.

1:11:54.807 --> 1:11:56.608
Oh, we didn't lose.

1:11:56.642 --> 1:11:59.078
But you ain't won yet either.

1:11:59.111 --> 1:12:00.179
You scared?

1:13:40.312 --> 1:13:41.613
Ow!

1:13:43.749 --> 1:13:44.784
Whew!

1:13:46.919 --> 1:13:48.620
Hey, hotshot.

1:13:49.655 --> 1:13:51.290
Pour me one.

1:13:51.323 --> 1:13:56.662
And then you and me
do a little bump and grind.

1:13:58.964 --> 1:14:01.834
Vi, you need to calm down,
cool off.

1:14:01.867 --> 1:14:02.944
Come on, what you want,
a Coca-Cola?

1:14:02.968 --> 1:14:04.170
I'll buy it, I'll buy it. Hm?

1:14:04.203 --> 1:14:07.605
I don't want no Coca-Cola
and I don't wanna cool off.

1:14:09.375 --> 1:14:12.812
There are all these men
for you to dance with, so.

1:14:12.845 --> 1:14:14.222
Go on, get out,
you're embarrassing yourself,

1:14:14.246 --> 1:14:15.347
I'm with this lady.

1:14:15.381 --> 1:14:16.449
Go on.

1:14:16.482 --> 1:14:18.226
- Can I get another drink?
- What you want to drink?

1:14:18.250 --> 1:14:20.019
And you ain't gonna get
no water.

1:14:20.052 --> 1:14:21.619
Coca-Cola.

1:14:23.022 --> 1:14:24.622
You with this fresh meat?

1:14:24.657 --> 1:14:26.158
I'm with myself.

1:14:28.294 --> 1:14:30.096
Yourself, huh?

1:14:30.129 --> 1:14:31.263
Yeah.

1:14:33.332 --> 1:14:35.901
Well, you young and sassy now,

1:14:35.935 --> 1:14:39.839
but you gonna get old
and used-up fast, gal,

1:14:39.872 --> 1:14:42.241
'cause nigger women
at the bottom of the rung

1:14:42.274 --> 1:14:43.909
that everybody's stepping on.

1:14:43.943 --> 1:14:45.077
Agh!

1:14:50.282 --> 1:14:54.053
Y'all so fired up
about civil rights?

1:14:55.754 --> 1:14:58.791
Oh, y'all are quiet now.

1:14:58.824 --> 1:15:02.361
Boy from New York coming here
talkin' 'bout Jim Crow.

1:15:03.429 --> 1:15:05.731
What about Jane Crow?

1:15:06.799 --> 1:15:08.100
What about us?

1:15:09.168 --> 1:15:10.369
What about us?

1:15:27.153 --> 1:15:29.688
Here, drink a cola
and don't worry about all that.

1:15:29.722 --> 1:15:31.123
She just liquored up.

1:15:31.157 --> 1:15:32.892
It's not the liquor,
she's cursed.

1:15:32.925 --> 1:15:34.059
She's cursed?

1:15:34.093 --> 1:15:35.094
Yes.

1:15:35.127 --> 1:15:38.697
She wants to feel alive
but don't have a chance.

1:15:38.731 --> 1:15:40.966
Shit, she ain't nothin'
but an old bar whore.

1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:42.201
Liquor all she want.

1:15:44.737 --> 1:15:46.305
She's like my mama.

1:15:46.338 --> 1:15:49.008
High hopes and low expectations.

1:15:49.041 --> 1:15:51.410
I don't wanna end up like them
with no hope for better.

1:15:53.512 --> 1:15:55.281
Well, you ain't like them.

1:15:58.150 --> 1:15:59.752
A real fine lady.

1:16:03.088 --> 1:16:04.456
Walter, come on.

1:16:04.490 --> 1:16:05.591
You need to stop.

1:16:05.624 --> 1:16:07.927
All right, come on now,
we gonna need to get along.

1:16:09.128 --> 1:16:10.729
We gonna be seeing
a lot of each other.

1:16:10.763 --> 1:16:13.098
Us with all of this time
we got in the world.

1:16:13.132 --> 1:16:15.167
Y'all with all that money.

1:16:15.201 --> 1:16:16.468
Wait.

1:16:16.502 --> 1:16:18.103
What you mean,
us with all the money?

1:16:18.137 --> 1:16:19.447
No, wait,
we the ones with all the time

1:16:19.471 --> 1:16:20.782
and you the ones
with all the money.

1:16:20.806 --> 1:16:23.042
Nah, that's not
how this deal goes.

1:16:23.075 --> 1:16:25.320
You mean to tell me your man
over there ain't got nothin'?

1:16:25.344 --> 1:16:26.345
My man ain't got shit.

1:16:26.378 --> 1:16:30.115
He done bought every
last swamp deal there is.

1:16:30.149 --> 1:16:32.518
We been sacrificin' while
treatin' y'all like kings.

1:16:35.154 --> 1:16:36.455
Woo.

1:16:37.957 --> 1:16:39.525
Well.

1:16:39.558 --> 1:16:41.927
Looks to me like
you've been baitin' a catch.

1:16:41.961 --> 1:16:42.961
Here.

1:16:44.096 --> 1:16:46.065
I don't want you to think
you gave me nothin',

1:16:46.098 --> 1:16:48.467
'cause you ain't nothin'
to give.

1:16:48.500 --> 1:16:49.868
Well, you too hard on me, girl.

1:16:49.902 --> 1:16:50.946
And you too light
on yourself, Walter.

1:16:50.970 --> 1:16:53.439
Come on, Jubilee,
we gonna talk about it, baby.

1:16:53.472 --> 1:16:55.507
You gonna come back?

1:16:55.541 --> 1:16:57.910
- Kiss my ass.
- Come on.

1:16:57.943 --> 1:16:59.011
I'd love to kiss your ass.

1:16:59.044 --> 1:17:00.279
Come on back.

1:17:00.312 --> 1:17:03.282
You fine as any... look at you
twistin' your hips like that.

1:17:03.315 --> 1:17:04.450
I love you, girl.

1:17:22.835 --> 1:17:23.969
Boss.

1:17:24.003 --> 1:17:25.371
- Psst, boss.
- Hm?

1:17:25.404 --> 1:17:26.538
Boss, come on.

1:17:26.572 --> 1:17:28.307
You scared the piss out of me.

1:17:28.340 --> 1:17:29.884
What the hell are you
doin' here so early?

1:17:29.908 --> 1:17:31.043
We gotta go. Come on, man.

1:17:31.076 --> 1:17:33.345
Man is supposed to relax
on the Sabbath.

1:17:33.379 --> 1:17:35.323
And they probably plannin'
fried chicken for lunch.

1:17:35.347 --> 1:17:36.591
There ain't gonna be
no fried chicken,

1:17:36.615 --> 1:17:38.417
no more love makin',
no morning bakery.

1:17:38.450 --> 1:17:39.653
- We gotta go.
- What the hell

1:17:39.686 --> 1:17:42.054
- you jabberin' on about?
- We're overstayin' our welcome.

1:17:46.992 --> 1:17:48.560
Ah, thank you very much,
Jubilee.

1:17:48.594 --> 1:17:50.229
You folded the clothes,
I appreciate you.

1:17:50.262 --> 1:17:52.231
Grace?

1:17:52.264 --> 1:17:54.142
All right, ma'am,
we gonna get get out your way.

1:17:54.166 --> 1:17:55.234
Come on, boss.

1:17:56.602 --> 1:17:58.137
Jubilee, you want a piece...

1:18:06.245 --> 1:18:07.413
Damn.

1:18:09.181 --> 1:18:10.849
Things were gonna be so good.

1:18:12.918 --> 1:18:14.920
Puttin' the weight
of the world down.

1:18:16.121 --> 1:18:17.289
But she was only after...

1:18:17.323 --> 1:18:20.125
What they all after, Jack,
and you ain't got jack shit.

1:18:21.560 --> 1:18:22.394
I'd appreciate it if people

1:18:22.428 --> 1:18:24.530
spent a little less time
on my few faults

1:18:24.563 --> 1:18:27.299
and concentrated more
on my many attributes.

1:18:27.333 --> 1:18:29.101
You a good politician.

1:18:34.306 --> 1:18:36.175
She didn't want to get used.

1:18:36.208 --> 1:18:38.077
Hell, I get used all the time.

1:19:17.015 --> 1:19:18.183
I'll think it over.

1:19:23.422 --> 1:19:24.422
Hm.

1:19:26.091 --> 1:19:27.694
This is Grace Gordon.

1:19:29.495 --> 1:19:30.697
If you're there...

1:19:32.564 --> 1:19:34.233
please give me a sign.

1:19:40.539 --> 1:19:42.441
No.

1:19:42.474 --> 1:19:43.976
I didn't think so.

1:19:56.155 --> 1:19:57.389
Oh.

1:20:06.064 --> 1:20:07.266
And here's the pitch.

1:20:09.368 --> 1:20:12.304
Sorry, ma'am, we're between
breakfast and lunch.

1:20:12.337 --> 1:20:14.039
I can get you a cup of coffee
if you want.

1:20:14.072 --> 1:20:15.675
No, I'm here
about the advertisement.

1:20:15.708 --> 1:20:17.109
The hostess job?

1:20:17.142 --> 1:20:18.210
Yes.

1:20:19.478 --> 1:20:21.413
You ever work before?

1:20:21.447 --> 1:20:23.449
I've been a hostess
my entire life.

1:20:23.482 --> 1:20:25.652
A hostess, huh?

1:20:25.685 --> 1:20:28.187
Well, I think I could make
a difference here.

1:20:28.220 --> 1:20:30.657
How much you expectin'
to get paid?

1:20:30.690 --> 1:20:31.691
How much you payin'?

1:20:31.724 --> 1:20:35.561
Someone like you,
no skills, a dollar an hour.

1:20:35.594 --> 1:20:37.730
I'll take it.

1:20:37.764 --> 1:20:40.065
When you plannin' on startin'?

1:20:40.098 --> 1:20:41.400
Today.

1:20:42.635 --> 1:20:44.671
Okay, well, come on back,

1:20:44.704 --> 1:20:46.138
I'll introduce you to the girls.

1:20:46.171 --> 1:20:48.641
- Okay.
- Follow my rules around here.

1:20:50.342 --> 1:20:53.612
$8.50, hardly worth
draggin' my ass out of bed.

1:20:53.646 --> 1:20:55.290
Having to listen
to all of that complainin'

1:20:55.314 --> 1:20:57.082
about this crappy food.

1:20:57.115 --> 1:20:59.117
Well, you get what you give.

1:20:59.151 --> 1:21:02.454
I made $15
'cause I treat my people right.

1:21:02.488 --> 1:21:03.732
That's right, I keep forgettin'.

1:21:03.756 --> 1:21:06.058
Our little do-gooder just loves

1:21:06.091 --> 1:21:09.027
wipin' somebody's ass
for a dollar.

1:21:09.061 --> 1:21:10.673
We've been over this
too many times, Aileen.

1:21:10.697 --> 1:21:13.232
What we're doing here
is called capitalism.

1:21:13.265 --> 1:21:15.534
I get paid according
to my own effort.

1:21:15.567 --> 1:21:17.637
Just do a better job.

1:21:17.670 --> 1:21:19.404
You need to quit readin'
them books, Teresa.

1:21:19.438 --> 1:21:22.241
That's why you don't have
a ring on that finger.

1:21:22.274 --> 1:21:26.144
'Cause no man wants a woman
spoutin' out your kind of crazy.

1:21:26.178 --> 1:21:29.481
And how's havin' a man
worked out for you, nitwit?

1:21:29.515 --> 1:21:32.050
Havin' your own money
is freedom.

1:21:32.084 --> 1:21:34.419
All right, girls,
I'm not payin' you to argue.

1:21:34.453 --> 1:21:35.788
- Hi, Grace.
- Hi.

1:21:35.822 --> 1:21:37.289
We're not arguin',
it's just Teresa

1:21:37.322 --> 1:21:40.092
spoutin her normal retard shit.

1:21:40.125 --> 1:21:41.360
What the hell's all this?

1:21:41.393 --> 1:21:43.830
Oh, another day laborer
walked out.

1:21:43.863 --> 1:21:46.098
Well, I got somebody
who can help with that too.

1:21:46.131 --> 1:21:47.634
Who the hell are you?

1:21:47.667 --> 1:21:49.736
Well, all right,
bring 'em on by.

1:21:49.769 --> 1:21:50.737
See, all right,
you've all been complainin'

1:21:50.770 --> 1:21:52.571
about needin' some help.

1:21:52.604 --> 1:21:55.440
What's she gonna do,
give out fashion advice?

1:21:55.474 --> 1:21:56.375
She's gonna do the seatin'

1:21:56.408 --> 1:21:58.086
and she's gonna help you
clear your tables,

1:21:58.110 --> 1:21:59.622
and you're gonna give her
10% of what you get.

1:21:59.646 --> 1:22:01.213
10%?

1:22:01.246 --> 1:22:02.614
You're gonna starve us
out of here?

1:22:04.550 --> 1:22:08.755
Well, I believe you can make
this place at least 10% better.

1:22:08.788 --> 1:22:10.122
Thank you.

1:22:18.263 --> 1:22:20.465
Two eggs, over easy,
two hash browns.

1:22:20.499 --> 1:22:21.634
Toast.

1:22:26.138 --> 1:22:29.408
Third time today I've seen
them redneck boys go by.

1:22:29.441 --> 1:22:30.877
Looks like trouble to me.

1:22:30.910 --> 1:22:32.177
Yeah, I know.

1:22:32.210 --> 1:22:35.113
I've been keepin' my eye on 'em.

1:22:35.147 --> 1:22:37.549
They're lovin' these cakes
you've been bringin' in.

1:22:37.583 --> 1:22:39.451
They're nearly licking
the plates clean.

1:22:39.484 --> 1:22:41.162
They may be lickin' the plates
of my cakes clean,

1:22:41.186 --> 1:22:43.756
but not these plates
with this nasty food.

1:22:43.790 --> 1:22:46.458
Shut up, girl,
and get back to work.

1:22:48.895 --> 1:22:50.596
I hate this place.

1:22:50.629 --> 1:22:52.331
Mm-hm.

1:22:52.364 --> 1:22:55.334
We have talked
for a hundred years

1:22:55.367 --> 1:22:56.568
or more.

1:22:59.171 --> 1:23:04.543
It is time now
to write the next chapter

1:23:04.576 --> 1:23:07.379
and to write it
in the books of law.

1:23:12.317 --> 1:23:14.353
I urge you again,

1:23:14.386 --> 1:23:18.691
as I did in 19 and 57,

1:23:18.725 --> 1:23:22.662
and again in 19 and 60,

1:23:22.695 --> 1:23:26.431
to enact a civil rights law

1:23:26.465 --> 1:23:28.635
- so that we can move forward...
- Oh, for...

1:23:28.668 --> 1:23:30.837
- to eliminate from this nation.
- Shh.

1:23:30.870 --> 1:23:35.540
Every trace
of discrimination and oppression

1:23:35.574 --> 1:23:39.311
that is based upon
race or color.

1:23:46.585 --> 1:23:50.723
There could be no greater
source of strength

1:23:50.757 --> 1:23:54.727
to this nation,
both at home and abroad.

1:23:56.561 --> 1:24:00.365
Second, no act of ours

1:24:00.399 --> 1:24:04.871
means more security
for those now working.

1:24:04.904 --> 1:24:05.938
More...

1:24:06.873 --> 1:24:09.441
Damn socialist.

1:24:09.474 --> 1:24:11.443
I'm lockin' up in back.

1:24:11.476 --> 1:24:13.278
You two watch the front for me.

1:24:18.951 --> 1:24:20.920
Good evening
and you're welcome...

1:24:24.757 --> 1:24:25.992
Ma'am.

1:24:26.959 --> 1:24:29.662
If you don't mind,
would you seat us.

1:24:30.930 --> 1:24:32.865
Now y'all know
this is gonna cause trouble.

1:24:34.033 --> 1:24:35.835
Yes, ma'am, it probably is.

1:24:40.773 --> 1:24:42.775
Thank you.
Come on, let's sit down.

1:24:45.577 --> 1:24:47.512
Oh my God.

1:24:47.546 --> 1:24:49.015
Oh my.

1:24:50.950 --> 1:24:52.018
Here we go.

1:24:59.892 --> 1:25:00.993
Oh, hell no.

1:25:01.027 --> 1:25:02.028
What? Agh!

1:25:02.061 --> 1:25:03.796
Come here, come here!

1:25:03.830 --> 1:25:05.765
What the hell?

1:25:05.798 --> 1:25:07.265
That hoity-toity seated them?

1:25:07.299 --> 1:25:08.500
And in my station?

1:25:08.533 --> 1:25:10.703
I'm not touchin' nothin'
they put their fat lips on.

1:25:10.737 --> 1:25:12.972
Hey. Come here.

1:25:15.373 --> 1:25:17.810
God, woman, what the hell
were you thinkin'?

1:25:17.844 --> 1:25:18.911
I can't serve Negroes.

1:25:18.945 --> 1:25:20.445
No one will put a foot
in here again.

1:25:20.479 --> 1:25:21.489
They're well-mannered
and they're polite.

1:25:21.513 --> 1:25:23.015
Don't be naive.

1:25:23.049 --> 1:25:24.549
They're lookin' for trouble.

1:25:24.583 --> 1:25:26.061
And so are those rednecks
right there.

1:25:26.085 --> 1:25:27.887
Look here, I didn't plan
on being center stage

1:25:27.920 --> 1:25:29.387
of their drama.

1:25:30.857 --> 1:25:32.925
One fork touches one pair
of nigger lips...

1:25:32.959 --> 1:25:34.459
All right, hey, boys.

1:25:34.493 --> 1:25:35.762
Hey, let's just calm down.

1:25:35.795 --> 1:25:37.596
Shut the fuck up.

1:25:37.629 --> 1:25:38.765
You again?

1:25:38.798 --> 1:25:39.766
You seat these niggers?

1:25:39.799 --> 1:25:40.967
Well, I am the hostess,

1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:42.635
so, yes,
I'm in charge of seatin'.

1:25:42.668 --> 1:25:44.737
You ain't in charge of nothin'.

1:25:45.772 --> 1:25:47.439
You want some of this, boy?

1:25:47.472 --> 1:25:49.809
Now, you keep your place
like women are meant to.

1:25:49.842 --> 1:25:52.544
And the sooner you get that
through your damn spoiled skull,

1:25:52.577 --> 1:25:54.013
- you don't matter shit.
- Ow!

1:25:54.046 --> 1:25:55.046
Hey!

1:25:56.548 --> 1:25:57.650
She matters plenty.

1:26:07.492 --> 1:26:08.493
Hey...

1:26:08.527 --> 1:26:09.695
Hey.

1:26:09.729 --> 1:26:12.031
Hey, we did not come here
for fighting.

1:26:14.867 --> 1:26:16.002
Spratz Diner.

1:26:17.036 --> 1:26:18.603
Good enough to get arrested.

1:26:41.861 --> 1:26:43.138
What you got
up your sleeve, huh?

1:26:43.162 --> 1:26:44.697
We ain't got nothin'
up our sleeves.

1:26:44.730 --> 1:26:46.732
- Mm-hm.
- We got straight-out demands.

1:26:48.768 --> 1:26:49.836
And what's that?

1:26:49.869 --> 1:26:50.837
An appetizer.

1:26:50.870 --> 1:26:51.904
- Appetizer?
- Mm-hm.

1:26:51.938 --> 1:26:52.905
That's more like a tantalizer.

1:26:52.939 --> 1:26:54.539
Miss Mattie,
what's goin' on in there?

1:26:54.573 --> 1:26:56.142
We just tryin'
to feed you, sugar.

1:26:57.276 --> 1:26:59.377
You women puttin' all
your voodoo magic in food,

1:26:59.411 --> 1:27:00.756
tryin' to get him to do
something he don't want to do.

1:27:00.780 --> 1:27:01.948
But you ain't gonna get him.

1:27:01.981 --> 1:27:04.116
And you ain't gonna
get me neither.

1:27:04.150 --> 1:27:06.085
Who said anything
about gettin' you?

1:27:08.154 --> 1:27:10.923
We ain't practicin'
no voodoo up in here.

1:27:13.592 --> 1:27:15.527
What do you need of me?
I'm at your service.

1:27:17.063 --> 1:27:18.530
It's the bill.

1:27:18.563 --> 1:27:19.632
The bill? What bill?

1:27:19.665 --> 1:27:21.133
The Civil Rights Bill.

1:27:21.167 --> 1:27:22.467
Oh, for God's sake.

1:27:22.500 --> 1:27:24.170
Not you, too.

1:27:24.203 --> 1:27:25.771
May we please
talk about somethin' else?

1:27:25.805 --> 1:27:26.973
Cornbread.

1:27:27.006 --> 1:27:28.406
Delicious.

1:27:28.440 --> 1:27:30.910
Those look really fantastic.

1:27:30.943 --> 1:27:32.778
I thought you liked
a good debate.

1:27:35.014 --> 1:27:36.883
Yes, a good one.

1:27:37.984 --> 1:27:39.852
Then I have one.

1:27:41.220 --> 1:27:42.722
Put women in.

1:27:45.691 --> 1:27:46.691
Women.

1:27:51.596 --> 1:27:55.701
Dear lady, women are
not part of the debate.

1:27:55.735 --> 1:27:58.738
No one on any side
has introduced that idea,

1:27:58.771 --> 1:28:00.572
includin' that
Martin Luther King.

1:28:00.605 --> 1:28:01.884
He's at the helm
of this movement now,

1:28:01.908 --> 1:28:04.911
and including women
is not his intention.

1:28:07.947 --> 1:28:10.850
No, not this time.

1:28:10.883 --> 1:28:12.517
Then when?

1:28:14.153 --> 1:28:18.024
Without women,
this country does not exist.

1:28:18.057 --> 1:28:19.792
It's time, past time,

1:28:19.825 --> 1:28:22.560
for women to be able
to pursue their own happiness,

1:28:22.594 --> 1:28:24.529
their own liberty under the law.

1:28:27.099 --> 1:28:28.500
My fair lady,

1:28:28.533 --> 1:28:30.236
for thousands of years,

1:28:30.269 --> 1:28:32.972
all of us have agreed
to call women the weaker sex.

1:28:33.005 --> 1:28:35.540
Now we all know it's not true,

1:28:35.573 --> 1:28:36.909
but it does make men
feel needed.

1:28:36.943 --> 1:28:40.246
And men need to feel needed.

1:28:40.279 --> 1:28:42.648
A man's not needed,
he's just gonna sit down on ya.

1:28:44.050 --> 1:28:46.618
We need to be
your white knights,

1:28:46.652 --> 1:28:47.787
not your equal.

1:28:49.587 --> 1:28:51.991
The facts are many women
have to take care of themselves.

1:28:52.024 --> 1:28:54.592
They scratch out a livin'.

1:28:54.626 --> 1:28:56.062
Unfairly paid for their work.

1:28:56.095 --> 1:28:57.629
And why? Because it's allowed

1:28:57.663 --> 1:29:01.599
because there are no laws,
no protection.

1:29:02.635 --> 1:29:03.601
Now, with this bill,

1:29:03.636 --> 1:29:05.570
Lady Liberty might
become color blind to men,

1:29:05.603 --> 1:29:09.507
but she still continues
to turn a blind eye

1:29:09.541 --> 1:29:11.277
to what you call the fairer sex.

1:29:24.690 --> 1:29:27.059
You have me at a disadvantage.

1:29:33.299 --> 1:29:35.868
You'll be remembered
for being noble.

1:29:38.603 --> 1:29:42.675
If I do this,
I'll be remembered as a fool,

1:29:42.708 --> 1:29:44.542
if I'm remembered at all.

1:29:48.014 --> 1:29:50.316
- May I eat somethin' now?
- Yes, you may.

1:29:51.917 --> 1:29:53.252
They do look good.

1:30:01.827 --> 1:30:03.662
- Ruth?
- Yes.

1:30:03.696 --> 1:30:04.930
Ruth, it's Grace Gordon.

1:30:04.964 --> 1:30:06.265
- Hi, Grace.
- Hi.

1:30:06.298 --> 1:30:07.633
Um...

1:30:10.069 --> 1:30:11.971
Boy, do I have
a lot to tell you.

1:30:12.004 --> 1:30:14.673
But you know that...
that bag of money you got?

1:30:14.707 --> 1:30:15.808
Mm-hm.

1:30:15.841 --> 1:30:18.010
Well, you ever think
of investin' it?

1:30:19.245 --> 1:30:22.348
As you said, play to our assets.

1:30:48.174 --> 1:30:51.811
In all the years you've been
scrapin' the sidewalks of DC,

1:30:51.844 --> 1:30:53.913
you two have never yet met?

1:30:53.946 --> 1:30:56.782
We travel down different paths.

1:30:56.816 --> 1:30:59.351
Mr. Celler travels with a union

1:30:59.385 --> 1:31:03.189
that doesn't think women
are to be treated as equal.

1:31:03.222 --> 1:31:05.324
And, as you know,
it's my lifelong ambition

1:31:05.357 --> 1:31:09.361
- to prove they should.
- Don't misrepresent me.

1:31:09.395 --> 1:31:13.165
I've said that women should
remain a protected class.

1:31:13.199 --> 1:31:15.768
Protected.
That's better than equal.

1:31:15.801 --> 1:31:17.736
Oh.

1:31:17.770 --> 1:31:19.105
- Miss Powell.
- Thank you.

1:31:19.138 --> 1:31:20.239
- Emanuel.
- Oh, thank you.

1:31:20.272 --> 1:31:22.308
This isn't gonna hurt much.

1:31:22.341 --> 1:31:23.819
We've got a bill
in Congress right now

1:31:23.843 --> 1:31:26.645
that wants to designate
bourbon whiskey

1:31:26.679 --> 1:31:28.948
as a distinctive product
of the United States.

1:31:28.981 --> 1:31:29.949
Think about that.

1:31:29.982 --> 1:31:31.884
Just a few short decades ago,

1:31:31.917 --> 1:31:34.120
this was illegal.

1:31:34.153 --> 1:31:37.923
Shows you how quick people
can have their minds changed.

1:31:37.957 --> 1:31:39.101
So what shall we drink to, huh?

1:31:39.125 --> 1:31:40.759
Well, let's get
right down to it.

1:31:40.793 --> 1:31:43.863
To fairer days
for the fairer sex,

1:31:43.896 --> 1:31:46.065
and to amending
the Civil Rights Bill

1:31:46.098 --> 1:31:48.100
to include women.

1:31:50.069 --> 1:31:52.071
Is that why you got her here,
the bill?

1:31:52.104 --> 1:31:55.074
Now, Emanuel, hear her out.

1:31:55.107 --> 1:31:56.308
You won't melt.

1:31:56.342 --> 1:31:58.878
Well, there will be
no undermining

1:31:58.911 --> 1:32:01.947
this long overdue issue.

1:32:01.981 --> 1:32:04.416
This bill is for the Negro man,
not women.

1:32:04.450 --> 1:32:06.352
- Not now.
- If not now, when?

1:32:06.385 --> 1:32:08.988
I believe Abigail Adams
asked that very question.

1:32:09.021 --> 1:32:11.991
188 years ago.

1:32:12.024 --> 1:32:13.135
Domestic violence and death,

1:32:13.159 --> 1:32:16.729
it just plays out across
our land night after night,

1:32:16.762 --> 1:32:18.864
and the police refuse
to even take the calls.

1:32:18.898 --> 1:32:21.433
They say she belongs to him.

1:32:21.467 --> 1:32:24.170
A woman doesn't have
any real protection

1:32:24.203 --> 1:32:28.807
unless she has equal access
to a job, to money, to freedom.

1:32:28.841 --> 1:32:31.143
And when they take off
to have their child,

1:32:31.177 --> 1:32:32.411
who will replace them?

1:32:32.444 --> 1:32:34.713
That is a problem.

1:32:34.747 --> 1:32:35.891
And when they return to work,

1:32:35.915 --> 1:32:37.716
who will rear their child?

1:32:37.750 --> 1:32:40.085
Women occupy one
of the most important roles

1:32:40.119 --> 1:32:44.089
in our society: Motherhood.

1:32:45.891 --> 1:32:48.394
It is a man's job
to protect the women.

1:32:48.427 --> 1:32:50.196
Now, Congressman Celler,

1:32:50.229 --> 1:32:53.832
let's not pretend that
all men protect their women,

1:32:53.866 --> 1:32:56.402
nor are we instructing them
to do so.

1:32:56.435 --> 1:32:58.804
And what you refer to

1:32:58.837 --> 1:33:03.976
as the most vital of all jobs
is unpaid,

1:33:04.009 --> 1:33:06.812
in a land
where the dollar is king.

1:33:08.280 --> 1:33:12.885
The mother is a pauper
or a slave.

1:33:15.888 --> 1:33:18.257
To be absolutely fair,

1:33:18.290 --> 1:33:22.528
probably women will do some
things I wish they wouldn't,

1:33:22.561 --> 1:33:24.363
but it's not our business
to tell them

1:33:24.396 --> 1:33:26.966
what they should do
with their freedom.

1:33:26.999 --> 1:33:29.368
But it is our business
to make sure

1:33:29.401 --> 1:33:31.770
that they have the right to try.

1:33:35.374 --> 1:33:36.842
Gentlemen.

1:33:39.878 --> 1:33:41.156
Don't even think about this,
Congressman,

1:33:41.180 --> 1:33:42.915
no piece of ass
worth throwin' ourselves

1:33:42.948 --> 1:33:44.025
under the load about to hit us.

1:33:44.049 --> 1:33:45.551
Watch your language.

1:33:45.584 --> 1:33:49.855
I said I was gonna do this,
so I will.

1:33:49.888 --> 1:33:52.191
Now, everything straight?

1:33:55.094 --> 1:33:56.438
Your face gonna
be in the dictionary

1:33:56.462 --> 1:33:57.997
under T for Traitor.

1:33:58.030 --> 1:33:59.398
Walter.

1:33:59.431 --> 1:34:01.533
There are no faces
of forgotten congressmen

1:34:01.567 --> 1:34:03.335
in the dictionary.

1:34:03.369 --> 1:34:05.504
It's all gonna be just fine.

1:34:05.537 --> 1:34:07.906
As long as everybody
follows the rules.

1:34:07.940 --> 1:34:11.443
What we have works.

1:34:24.223 --> 1:34:26.258
If you are determined

1:34:26.292 --> 1:34:29.261
to keep this bill as it stands,

1:34:29.295 --> 1:34:31.597
there will remain only one group

1:34:31.630 --> 1:34:34.433
of second-class citizens
in this country.

1:34:36.235 --> 1:34:41.006
Your mothers, sisters,
wives, and daughters.

1:34:42.508 --> 1:34:43.508
Women.

1:36:09.561 --> 1:36:11.563
So good of you to help.

1:36:11.597 --> 1:36:13.332
It's the least I could do.

1:36:13.365 --> 1:36:16.201
After what you did for me
and Angelina.

1:36:16.235 --> 1:36:18.003
Set us up in business.

1:36:18.036 --> 1:36:20.105
I'm Avon now.

1:36:20.139 --> 1:36:22.207
Door-to-door sales.

1:36:22.241 --> 1:36:24.410
And I've been meetin'
all sorts of interestin' people.

1:36:25.645 --> 1:36:27.680
Women sellin' to women.

1:36:27.714 --> 1:36:29.716
It's the future.

1:36:29.749 --> 1:36:31.083
Sure is my future.

1:36:33.552 --> 1:36:35.454
Well, you tell her,

1:36:35.487 --> 1:36:37.990
I'm not gonna charge her
interest.

1:36:38.023 --> 1:36:39.258
I want to help.

1:36:39.291 --> 1:36:40.926
That's awfully nice of you.

1:36:42.729 --> 1:36:44.596
- Come on, little one.
- Come on, baby girl.

1:36:45.732 --> 1:36:46.999
Go on in here.

1:36:48.333 --> 1:36:49.636
Wanna see a trick?

1:36:49.669 --> 1:36:51.470
All right.

1:36:51.503 --> 1:36:52.938
You see this?

1:36:55.642 --> 1:36:57.242
You see it, right?

1:36:58.377 --> 1:37:00.212
Blow on it.

1:37:00.245 --> 1:37:01.980
VoilÃ .

1:37:02.014 --> 1:37:03.182
Wait a minute.

1:37:04.416 --> 1:37:06.318
This is for you.

1:37:06.351 --> 1:37:08.620
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1:37:08.655 --> 1:37:10.657
I will be at the opening night.

1:37:10.690 --> 1:37:12.024
Make sure Dick brings his wife,

1:37:12.057 --> 1:37:13.525
do somethin' nice for a change.

1:37:15.561 --> 1:37:16.562
Ruth...

1:37:19.531 --> 1:37:23.636
Would you be interested
in calling it a date?

1:37:23.670 --> 1:37:24.771
A date?

1:37:26.038 --> 1:37:28.273
- With me?
- Come on.

1:37:31.076 --> 1:37:32.110
All right.

1:37:34.781 --> 1:37:37.082
All right.
Did she say all right?

1:37:37.115 --> 1:37:38.383
Yeah, she did.

1:37:38.417 --> 1:37:39.752
She said all right.

1:37:39.786 --> 1:37:40.786
All right.

1:37:43.055 --> 1:37:44.055
A date.

1:37:45.491 --> 1:37:46.659
You got a boyfriend.

1:37:46.693 --> 1:37:48.160
Oh, come on now.

1:37:49.461 --> 1:37:51.263
For women, huh?

1:37:51.296 --> 1:37:53.633
Negro men waited 300 years
to get a seat at the table

1:37:53.666 --> 1:37:55.067
and what you do?

1:37:55.100 --> 1:37:57.302
Pull out a chair for 'em.

1:37:57.336 --> 1:37:59.471
Walter, you're gonna grumble
about this

1:37:59.505 --> 1:38:01.440
for the rest of your life.

1:38:01.473 --> 1:38:03.108
- They're equal.
- Mm-hm.

1:38:03.141 --> 1:38:06.713
You're equal, we're all equal.

1:38:06.746 --> 1:38:10.148
It's what we do with it now
that matters.

1:38:10.182 --> 1:38:13.619
Never in history
have those in power

1:38:13.653 --> 1:38:16.789
handed over such an opportunity.

1:38:16.823 --> 1:38:18.557
See where this takes us.

1:38:20.559 --> 1:38:22.427
Wait, slow down, slow down,
there it is.

1:38:22.461 --> 1:38:23.595
Mm-hm.

1:38:23.629 --> 1:38:26.766
Any other bastard would have
kept her in a gilded cage.

1:38:28.300 --> 1:38:30.202
I gave her an exit.

1:38:33.773 --> 1:38:35.407
I did it for them.

1:38:39.111 --> 1:38:40.312
For her.

1:39:05.872 --> 1:39:07.874
- Best table in the house.
- Thank you.

1:39:20.887 --> 1:39:21.887
Well.

1:39:34.533 --> 1:39:36.168
- Thank you, Walter.
- Yes, sir.

1:39:36.201 --> 1:39:37.804
Well, well, well.

1:39:37.837 --> 1:39:40.707
Look at what
these women have done.

1:39:43.241 --> 1:39:44.309
Mattie.

1:39:44.343 --> 1:39:45.678
It smells like magic here.

1:39:45.712 --> 1:39:46.712
Doin' our best.

1:39:49.649 --> 1:39:51.416
Grace.

1:39:51.450 --> 1:39:53.619
You have managed to accomplish

1:39:53.653 --> 1:39:55.922
what 200 years
of Congress could not.

1:39:57.389 --> 1:40:00.492
Everyone seated at the table.

1:40:00.525 --> 1:40:03.261
And I guess you won't need
my services anymore.

1:40:03.295 --> 1:40:05.732
Hm, I'll need you,
perhaps not, but...

1:40:07.399 --> 1:40:08.467
want?

1:40:10.469 --> 1:40:13.271
Tonight under the tree.

1:40:13.305 --> 1:40:15.440
And you think we'll make it
past sunrise this time?

1:40:15.474 --> 1:40:16.943
Yes, ma'am.

1:40:16.976 --> 1:40:18.878
Hey, you,
quit hogging the biscuits!

1:40:18.911 --> 1:40:20.046
I'll take care of this.

1:40:20.079 --> 1:40:22.280
Just like you always have
to take what's not yours.

1:40:22.314 --> 1:40:24.249
Oh, I wouldn't miss it.

1:40:25.550 --> 1:40:27.486
Another time and place.

1:40:27.519 --> 1:40:29.554
So nice that we all get
to break bread together,

1:40:29.588 --> 1:40:31.423
- isn't it?
- Yes, sir.

1:40:31.456 --> 1:40:33.760
Especially
in such a charming place.

1:40:34.994 --> 1:40:36.528
And those biscuits
are the finest

1:40:36.561 --> 1:40:38.330
south of the Mason-Dixon line.

1:40:38.363 --> 1:40:40.365
And trust me,
there's none good north of it.

1:40:40.399 --> 1:40:43.201
I just want to smash it
in my face.

1:40:43.235 --> 1:40:44.336
- Mm.
- Isn't that good?

1:40:44.369 --> 1:40:46.271
And always a pleasure
to see you both.

1:40:46.304 --> 1:40:47.940
Enjoy your meal,
enjoy your dinner.

1:40:52.611 --> 1:40:54.446
My goodness.

1:40:54.479 --> 1:40:55.958
I've never seen a table
with such beautiful women

1:40:55.982 --> 1:40:56.883
in my life.

1:40:56.916 --> 1:40:58.985
Gentlemen,
you better behave yourselves.

1:41:05.323 --> 1:41:06.324
How y'all doin'?

1:41:06.358 --> 1:41:07.392
Good?

1:41:08.995 --> 1:41:10.629
Ah, my man.

1:41:13.298 --> 1:41:14.801
Have a drink.
