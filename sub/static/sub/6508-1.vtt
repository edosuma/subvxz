WEBVTT

02:48.000 --> 02:51.208
Sita, go and tell Sister Clodagh
I wish to speak to her.

02:54.459 --> 02:56.333
..therefore...

02:56.417 --> 02:58.416
x is equal to five...

03:01.459 --> 03:02.958
..or...

03:03.042 --> 03:06.333
Reverend Mother wishes to speak to you,
Sister Clodagh.

03:06.417 --> 03:07.958
Joyah!

03:15.959 --> 03:18.041
Continue the lesson.

03:34.834 --> 03:36.874
Sister Clodagh,

03:36.959 --> 03:40.499
we may proceed with our plans at Mopu.

03:40.584 --> 03:42.624
It will be called St Faith.

03:42.709 --> 03:44.208
St Faith.

03:44.292 --> 03:47.458
And you have been appointed
to take charge of St Faith.

03:47.542 --> 03:49.291
I, Reverend Mother?

03:49.375 --> 03:50.833
You.

03:51.875 --> 03:55.249
You will be the youngest Sister Superior
in our Order.

03:58.917 --> 04:00.999
Thank you, Reverend Mother.

04:04.292 --> 04:06.583
The agent at Mopu is an Englishman.

04:08.125 --> 04:10.166
He seems a difficult man.

04:10.250 --> 04:13.166
You won't get much help from him.

04:15.334 --> 04:16.416
Dear Madam,

04:16.500 --> 04:17.583
My name is Dean.

04:17.666 --> 04:22.624
I am the agent of General Toda Rai at Mopu
and I am writing to you in that capacity.

04:22.709 --> 04:26.541
I understand the GeneraI has offered you
the oId PaIace of Mopu

04:26.625 --> 04:29.499
to make a school
and a dispensary for the natives.

04:29.584 --> 04:32.374
lt is not the first time he has had such ideas.

04:32.459 --> 04:35.791
He has asked me to tell you
about the place and the people.

04:37.209 --> 04:40.249
It's not a comfortable spot
and it's at the back of beyond.

04:40.334 --> 04:42.124
First, you have to get to DarjeeIing

04:42.250 --> 04:45.958
and then I have to find you ponies and porters
to take you into the hills.

04:46.042 --> 04:48.083
Mopu is eight thousand feet up.

04:48.167 --> 04:52.124
The peaks on the range opposite
are nearly as high as Everest.

04:52.209 --> 04:55.083
The peopIe caII the highest peak Nanda Devi.

04:55.167 --> 04:57.249
It means, "the bare goddess".

04:59.667 --> 05:04.624
I live down in the valley out of the wind,
so does the GeneraI and so do the people.

05:04.709 --> 05:07.999
Mopu Palace stands in the wind
on a shelf on the mountain.

05:08.084 --> 05:11.583
It was buiIt by the GeneraI's father
to keep his women there.

05:11.667 --> 05:13.291
It's called a paIace,

05:13.375 --> 05:17.666
but there may be a sIight difference between
your idea of a paIace and the General's.

05:17.750 --> 05:19.416
Anyhow, there it is.

05:20.542 --> 05:24.458
The peopIe are Iike mountain peasants
everywhere, simpIe and independent.

05:24.584 --> 05:29.624
They work because they must, smile when they
feel Iike it and are no respecters of persons.

05:29.709 --> 05:33.041
The men are men.
No better, no worse than anywhere eIse.

05:33.125 --> 05:34.749
The women are women,

05:34.834 --> 05:36.749
the children, children.

05:36.834 --> 05:40.666
Up on the mountain, above the palace,
we have our hoIy man,

05:40.750 --> 05:43.833
who sits there, day in and day out,
in all weathers.

05:43.917 --> 05:49.541
All the peopIe around are very proud of him
and bring him food and little offerings.

05:49.625 --> 05:52.416
The wind up at the palace
blows seven days a week,

05:52.500 --> 05:55.583
so, if you must come,
bring some warm things with you.

05:55.667 --> 05:58.916
Nobody has Iived there for a Iong time,
except Angu Ayah,

05:59.000 --> 06:02.041
who has aIways been there
and stays on as caretaker.

06:03.084 --> 06:08.833
As a caretaker, she's a bit of a failure, but she's
a faithful, dirty old bird and goes with the place.

06:09.875 --> 06:11.708
She lives there alone,

06:11.792 --> 06:14.166
with the ghosts of bygone days.

06:21.167 --> 06:24.291
(Voices overlapping) Ayah! Ayah!

07:06.875 --> 07:08.958
(Ghostly voice) Ayah!

07:19.459 --> 07:21.541
(Birdsong)

07:31.834 --> 07:33.458
(Ayah squawks)

07:33.542 --> 07:35.208
(Mimics parrot)

07:43.834 --> 07:45.916
(Bugle fanfare)

07:48.334 --> 07:50.374
(Fanfare continues)

07:50.459 --> 07:52.541
(Excited shouting)

08:00.250 --> 08:02.333
(Men call out)

08:11.167 --> 08:13.249
(Fanfare continues)

08:47.209 --> 08:49.749
Ayah! Ayah!

08:49.834 --> 08:53.583
- That's Mr Dean.
- Never mind Mr Dean. He will find us.

08:54.750 --> 08:56.791
Now, listen, Ayah,

08:56.875 --> 09:01.166
I have invited some ladies to stay here
at the House of Women.

09:01.250 --> 09:02.749
Ladies?

09:02.834 --> 09:06.249
Oh, that will be like old times!

09:06.334 --> 09:08.666
It will not be in the least like "old times".

09:08.750 --> 09:10.791
They are not that kind of lady, at all.

09:10.875 --> 09:13.958
- Then they won't be any fun.
- They are not coming for fun.

09:14.042 --> 09:15.583
These are nuns.

09:16.625 --> 09:18.583
You know what a nun is?

09:18.667 --> 09:21.583
They pray all day
like the monks you invited last year.

09:21.667 --> 09:25.999
I am going to give them this house
to make a school and a hospital for the people.

09:26.084 --> 09:28.708
But you know nobody here wants a school.

09:28.792 --> 09:31.416
And I'm sure they don't want a hospital.

09:31.500 --> 09:34.124
How do they know what
they want untiI they try it?

09:35.167 --> 09:37.333
The people have all kinds of diseases.

09:37.417 --> 09:40.624
- They have ringworm...
- They don't mind having ringworm.

09:40.709 --> 09:43.291
Then they ought to mind and it will all be free.

09:43.375 --> 09:45.541
It was free last time and nobody came.

09:47.167 --> 09:48.749
They will this time.

09:48.875 --> 09:54.916
Mr Dean! You will receive them for me and you
will do everything for them that they want doing.

09:55.959 --> 09:58.333
You, too. You will engage servants for them.

09:58.417 --> 10:02.124
You will both look after them
until they can look after themselves.

10:02.209 --> 10:04.874
What do they eat?
How do I know what nuns eat?

10:04.959 --> 10:07.041
I have remembered that.

10:11.334 --> 10:13.416
Do you see that crate?

10:17.500 --> 10:18.916
Sausages!

10:19.000 --> 10:20.833
They will eat sausages.

10:20.917 --> 10:23.874
Europeans eat sausages wherever they go.

10:24.000 --> 10:29.166
They will eat them when they come and until
they can tell the cook what else they want to eat.

10:29.250 --> 10:31.124
(Babble of voices)

10:33.459 --> 10:37.166
Now, remember, Ayah,
if you give any trouble, you will be sorry.

10:37.250 --> 10:39.333
I'm sorry now!

11:03.000 --> 11:04.833
A convent in this house!

11:04.917 --> 11:06.791
What do you think of that?

11:07.834 --> 11:10.041
The brothers only stayed five months.

11:11.167 --> 11:13.791
Perhaps the sisters won't stay long, either.

11:18.709 --> 11:20.958
The house is nine thousand feet up.

11:21.042 --> 11:22.916
Very coId, but good air.

11:23.959 --> 11:28.874
General Toda Rai, who has invited us to Mopu
has promised us every help.

11:29.959 --> 11:34.999
He was a little afraid, when he learnt that
we are bound to our Order only by yearly vows.

11:35.084 --> 11:38.249
- I explained this rule to him.
- Yes, Reverend Mother.

11:38.334 --> 11:43.666
For more than a century, to serve voluntarily
has been one of the glories of our Order.

11:43.750 --> 11:45.791
And our greatest strength.

11:45.875 --> 11:47.333
Exactly.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.124
He understands now.

11:50.209 --> 11:54.041
- Is there anything you would like to ask?
- Who am I to take with me?

12:04.334 --> 12:07.416
Remember, a community is not a class of girls.

12:07.500 --> 12:09.541
The sisters won't be easy to manage.

12:09.625 --> 12:11.291
Or to impress.

12:13.750 --> 12:15.833
Now, let me see...

12:20.959 --> 12:22.999
I'll give you Sister Briony.

12:23.084 --> 12:25.249
You'll need her strength.

12:25.334 --> 12:27.416
Thank you, Reverend Mother.

12:30.542 --> 12:32.624
Sister Philippa for the garden.

12:36.084 --> 12:37.791
- Sister Blanche...
- Sister Blanche.

12:37.875 --> 12:39.708
You know what the others call her?

12:39.792 --> 12:41.833
- Sister Honey.
- Yes, Honey.

12:41.917 --> 12:43.958
I think you'll need Sister Honey.

12:44.042 --> 12:46.333
She's popuIar and you'II need to be popuIar.

12:46.417 --> 12:48.958
(Giggling)

12:55.125 --> 12:57.708
- And Sister Ruth.
- But Sister Ruth is ill.

12:57.792 --> 12:59.499
That is why I want her to go.

13:03.042 --> 13:06.124
Forgive me for saying so,
Reverend Mother, but...

13:06.209 --> 13:09.249
do you think our vocation is her vocation?

13:10.959 --> 13:13.041
Yes, she's a problem.

13:14.084 --> 13:16.583
I'm afraid she'll be a problem for you, too.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.541
With a smaller community, she may be better.

13:20.625 --> 13:23.041
Give her responsibiIities, Sister.

13:23.125 --> 13:25.166
She badIy wants importance.

13:25.250 --> 13:28.499
Do you think it's a good thing
to let her feel important?

13:29.792 --> 13:32.249
Spare her some of your own importance.

13:32.334 --> 13:33.958
If you can.

13:34.042 --> 13:38.166
Mother, are you sorry that I have been
appointed to take charge of St Faith?

13:38.250 --> 13:39.749
Yes.

13:39.834 --> 13:42.249
I don't think you're ready for it.

13:42.334 --> 13:44.416
And I think you'll be lonely.

13:48.250 --> 13:50.749
Never forget, we are an order of workers.

13:51.792 --> 13:53.624
Work them hard

13:53.709 --> 13:57.958
and, remember,
the superior of all is a servant of all.

13:58.042 --> 13:59.708
I understand.

14:35.500 --> 14:38.583
(Bell continues to ring)
- It was a good, good idea.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.374
One thing about 'em, they keep good time.

14:46.042 --> 14:47.499
Go!

14:56.250 --> 14:58.041
(Horn)

15:04.917 --> 15:07.374
(Bell and prolonged note of horn echo)

15:07.459 --> 15:09.541
(Wind howls)

15:33.250 --> 15:35.333
(Local men sing)

15:50.125 --> 15:54.749
Oh, dear. A whole garden so terribly overgrown
I don't know where to begin.

15:57.292 --> 16:00.458
Please come and help the fat Lemini
who asks questions.

16:00.542 --> 16:03.708
Sister Briony?
Ayah, you must learn our proper names.

16:03.792 --> 16:07.083
- Anyway, there aren't any patients yet.
- Aren't there?

16:07.167 --> 16:10.458
There are dozens waiting.
And more coming every minute.

16:10.542 --> 16:12.624
(All talk at once in local language)

16:19.709 --> 16:21.374
ALL: Ah!

16:27.167 --> 16:30.458
Now, tell them to go away
and help me with the ones that are left.

16:30.542 --> 16:35.499
Sister Blanche, these girls are to work in your
lace schooI. They were sent by the GeneraI.

16:35.584 --> 16:37.208
Don't they look nice?

16:37.292 --> 16:41.874
Oh, but, Sister, you ought to see the children.
The schoolroom is full of them already.

16:42.000 --> 16:46.083
The little ones are so sweet.
Some of them can scarcely do more than toddle.

16:47.167 --> 16:50.708
- Joseph Anthony has come.
- Ayah, you must knock before you come in.

16:50.792 --> 16:53.166
- Who is Joseph Anthony?
- Who is Joseph Anthony?

16:53.292 --> 16:57.624
He is the son of the General's cook. He is going
to interpret for you. He speaks English.

16:58.667 --> 17:00.124
Come in.

17:05.709 --> 17:07.749
Has the General sent you?

17:07.834 --> 17:10.915
- Yes, lady.
- She isn't a lady. She is a sister.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.624
Say, yes, Lemini.

17:12.709 --> 17:14.124
Yes, Lemini.

17:14.209 --> 17:18.333
I have my box and my bedding outside,
because I shall live here with you.

17:18.416 --> 17:19.915
Oh?

17:20.000 --> 17:24.499
Would you like to see my box
and bedding, lady...Sister...Lemini?

17:24.584 --> 17:26.665
Would you, Auntie? They are new.

17:27.709 --> 17:29.791
- How old are you?
- Six to eleven.

17:30.875 --> 17:33.958
- What did you say?
- I can remember that I am six.

17:34.042 --> 17:37.416
But my father married my mother
eleven years ago.

17:37.500 --> 17:39.874
So I may probably be about ten.

17:39.959 --> 17:41.458
(Knock at door)

17:42.542 --> 17:44.791
The schoolroom is overflowing with children.

17:44.875 --> 17:47.791
We've nothing unpacked.
No-one understands the language.

17:47.875 --> 17:49.499
There are too many and they smell.

17:49.584 --> 17:51.291
l don't know what to do with them.

17:51.375 --> 17:54.666
Tell them to come back later.
Start with some of the older ones.

17:54.750 --> 17:57.499
- They won't go away, Lemini.
- Oh, why not?

17:57.584 --> 18:00.333
They were paid to come
and so they can't go away.

18:00.417 --> 18:01.749
- Paid?
(Knock at door)

18:01.834 --> 18:06.666
Sister, the General's clerk has orders to pay
everybody who comes to my dispensary.

18:06.750 --> 18:08.791
So, of course, they all want to come.

18:08.875 --> 18:11.249
- Excuse me, may I suggest...
- Yes, Sister?

18:11.334 --> 18:13.833
Wouldn't it be a pity to send the children away?

18:13.917 --> 18:17.499
- They were paid to come.
- But if they like it, they may come again.

18:17.584 --> 18:20.416
What can you do with them?
They look very stupid to me.

18:20.500 --> 18:23.166
They can't speak a word of Hindustani
or English.

18:23.250 --> 18:25.083
Joseph can.

18:27.209 --> 18:29.249
You'll help us, won't you, Joseph?

18:29.334 --> 18:31.791
The brothers left a blackboard in the school.

18:31.875 --> 18:34.083
I'II draw things on it in coloured chaIk.

18:34.167 --> 18:37.958
They can tell me their name for it
and I'll tell them the English.

18:38.042 --> 18:40.874
l can take their names
and ages and make a register.

18:40.959 --> 18:42.708
You can hardly call that a lesson.

18:42.792 --> 18:44.916
You can call it a very sensible idea.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.666
Thank you, Sister Blanche.

18:58.500 --> 19:00.583
(Men shouting)

19:14.917 --> 19:16.999
I suppose you know who I am?

19:18.209 --> 19:20.291
You must be Mr Dean.

19:23.459 --> 19:24.999
I must.

19:26.334 --> 19:29.041
And you must be the Sister Superior.

19:34.709 --> 19:38.708
What curious feathers.
Are they all from the birds that you've shot?

19:38.792 --> 19:40.874
I don't shoot birds.

19:42.042 --> 19:45.041
When you've shot everything, it palls, doesn't it?

19:48.334 --> 19:50.874
I'm the General's agent.
He welcomes you to Mopu.

19:50.959 --> 19:52.791
I understood you wanted to see me.

19:52.875 --> 19:54.999
We want to talk to you on business.

19:55.084 --> 19:57.958
I didn't suppose you want to talk to me
on anything else.

20:01.834 --> 20:03.916
Sorry. Perhaps that wasn't fair.

20:04.959 --> 20:06.458
Mr Dean,

20:06.542 --> 20:11.791
you know that General Toda Rai, has given us
this house for a new foundation of our Order.

20:11.875 --> 20:13.916
We very much appreciate it.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.083
It's very generous of him.

20:17.125 --> 20:18.624
Yes.

20:18.709 --> 20:20.749
You'd like the General, Sister.

20:20.834 --> 20:22.874
He also is a superior being.

20:22.959 --> 20:24.333
Really!

20:25.459 --> 20:28.333
I don't know why you are being
so rude to me, Mr Dean.

20:28.417 --> 20:31.624
I have to talk business with you,
whether I like it or not.

20:31.709 --> 20:33.999
Well, talk it then and don't teach it me.

20:36.667 --> 20:39.124
It's no place to put a nunnery, I can tell you that.

20:39.209 --> 20:41.041
Difficult, but not impossible.

20:41.125 --> 20:44.291
- Nothing is impossible...
- Is yours a contempIative order?

20:45.417 --> 20:49.499
I mean, do you live in meditation
or whatever you call it? Do you keep solitude?

20:50.959 --> 20:54.583
Our Order isn't in the least like that.
We are very busy people.

20:54.667 --> 20:58.708
We're going to open a dispensary,
a school for children and a class for girls.

20:58.834 --> 21:03.666
Good. You'll be doing me a great favour
when you begin to educate the local girls, Sister.

21:07.709 --> 21:11.666
I have already been told, Mr Dean,
that you do not believe in solitude.

21:14.709 --> 21:17.583
Do you know what the people call this place?

21:17.667 --> 21:19.249
The House of Women.

21:19.334 --> 21:22.291
The General's father
used to keep his Iadies here.

21:22.375 --> 21:25.416
From now on,
it will be known as the House of St Faith.

21:26.459 --> 21:29.166
Sister, will you have that picture taken down?

21:35.417 --> 21:37.291
I give you till the rains break.

21:41.542 --> 21:43.624
(Rhythmic drumbeat)

22:00.542 --> 22:02.208
(Wind whistles)

22:13.875 --> 22:15.749
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

22:18.209 --> 22:19.833
(Knock at door)

22:19.917 --> 22:21.416
Who is it?

22:21.500 --> 22:23.958
(Door opens, wind howls)
- Sister Briony.

22:24.042 --> 22:26.124
(Bells jingle)

22:31.875 --> 22:33.958
(Drums continue to beat)

22:35.459 --> 22:37.124
I can't sleep.

22:43.375 --> 22:45.249
Anything wrong, Sister?

22:46.375 --> 22:48.833
It's Sister Ruth. I've just seen her.

22:48.917 --> 22:50.791
- How is she?
- She's sick.

22:51.834 --> 22:56.166
She has violent pains in her joints,
a boil on her finger and headaches.

22:57.542 --> 22:59.374
It's this wind.

22:59.459 --> 23:01.499
And we all seem so tired.

23:01.584 --> 23:03.666
It's the altitude.

23:05.667 --> 23:08.041
My dispensary is more crowded than ever.

23:09.084 --> 23:11.124
This big house to look after.

23:11.209 --> 23:13.249
All the unpacking still to be done.

23:13.334 --> 23:15.624
And the plumbing has broken down again.

23:16.667 --> 23:19.249
What do you think, Sister? Perhaps Mr Dean...

23:19.334 --> 23:21.916
Certainly not. We can manage without Mr Dean.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.666
Yes, of course.

23:29.875 --> 23:32.958
- Are you all right, Sister?
- Of course I'm all right.

23:33.042 --> 23:35.666
- Show me your arm.
- I'm perfectly all right.

23:39.250 --> 23:41.083
So, you've got them, too.

23:41.167 --> 23:42.999
- What have I got?
- Spots.

23:43.084 --> 23:45.458
I've got them. Every one of us has got them.

23:45.542 --> 23:48.916
There must be something in the water here
that's very unhealthy.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.833
- The natives drink it.
- They get sick, themselves.

23:52.875 --> 23:56.708
Ayah has the General's ear,
the Young General. He's very ill.

24:00.750 --> 24:02.833
Those drums are beating for him.

24:04.917 --> 24:06.999
They beat all night while he's ill.

24:09.917 --> 24:12.208
If you hear them stop, he's dead.

24:17.542 --> 24:19.624
(Drums continue beating)

24:27.250 --> 24:28.916
(Drums stop)

25:02.625 --> 25:04.124
You!

25:04.209 --> 25:05.874
How do you do?

25:06.917 --> 25:08.958
What are you doing here?

25:09.042 --> 25:11.999
Excuse Old Feltie,
I haven't a hand to take him off.

25:12.084 --> 25:14.541
I've come to mend a loose joint in your pipe.

25:14.625 --> 25:17.916
- You must send a plumber!
- The nearest one is in Darjeeling.

25:18.000 --> 25:21.041
- I count plumbing among my other gifts.
- That's not...

25:21.125 --> 25:23.999
I swear to you, it's only the pipe I'm interested in.

25:24.084 --> 25:27.041
- I must see Sister Clodagh about this.
- All right.

25:27.125 --> 25:29.208
I forbid you to stay in there.

25:30.250 --> 25:31.791
All right.

25:40.875 --> 25:44.791
We have to build a work room
and a school and, later on, a chapel.

25:44.875 --> 25:48.208
Somebody has got to put locks
on my cupboards. I daren't unpack a thing.

25:48.292 --> 25:52.499
And the windows don't open and the doors
don't shut and the plumbing won't work.

25:55.792 --> 25:57.833
SISTER BRIONY:
Come in, Mr Dean.

25:57.917 --> 25:59.499
May I go now, Sister?

26:03.000 --> 26:04.874
Please sit down, Mr Dean.

26:09.125 --> 26:11.166
Would you like some coffee, Mr Dean?

26:11.250 --> 26:14.499
- Can you make it decently?
- Can I make coffee!

26:15.542 --> 26:18.166
- Can she?
- Full of grits.

26:21.167 --> 26:25.541
Mr Dean, Joseph tells us
that people are still being paid to come to us.

26:25.625 --> 26:27.666
Ah, the General's a wise man.

26:27.750 --> 26:29.749
It's only till it becomes a habit.

26:29.875 --> 26:34.791
Let it become a habit for them to come and
they won't remember the time when they didn't.

26:34.875 --> 26:37.499
Then, gradually, he'll leave off paying them.

26:37.584 --> 26:40.249
Gradually, it will become a habit not to be paid.

26:40.334 --> 26:41.958
They're like children.

26:42.042 --> 26:45.083
He told me he was going to order them to come.

26:45.167 --> 26:47.124
They don't know what an order is.

26:47.209 --> 26:49.041
Then they should learn.

26:49.125 --> 26:51.166
- Why?
- We all need discipline.

26:51.250 --> 26:55.749
You said they're like children. Without discipline,
we should all behave like children.

26:55.834 --> 26:57.874
Don't you like children?

26:57.959 --> 26:59.708
(Door opens)

27:03.875 --> 27:05.749
Thank you, Sister Briony.

27:23.334 --> 27:25.416
Talking of medicine, Sister Briony,

27:25.542 --> 27:30.499
if you get a bad case, one that seems to you as
though it might be dangerous or even serious,

27:30.584 --> 27:32.083
don't take it.

27:32.167 --> 27:34.416
- But that would be...
- It would be wise.

27:34.500 --> 27:38.624
If you got a bad case and someone died,
you'd have all the people up against you.

27:38.709 --> 27:40.541
Why?

27:40.625 --> 27:44.166
Well, you must remember
they are primitive people and like...

27:44.250 --> 27:46.458
Like children. Unreasonable children.

27:47.417 --> 27:51.333
They've never seen medicine before.
They'd think it was magic, a new kind of magic.

27:51.417 --> 27:53.499
So, remember, I've warned you.

27:54.542 --> 27:56.916
By the way, how are you feeling, all of you?

27:57.000 --> 27:59.749
Not very well. Sister Ruth is the worst.

27:59.834 --> 28:02.999
I think the water must be bad.
Ayah says it's the water.

28:03.084 --> 28:05.249
On the contrary, the water is too good.

28:05.334 --> 28:06.958
It's Darjeeling tummy.

28:07.042 --> 28:09.416
Well, I'd better get that plumbing fixed.

28:09.500 --> 28:11.249
Sister!

28:12.959 --> 28:14.999
What has happened, Sister?

28:15.084 --> 28:18.124
Oh, Sister, they brought in a woman,
our first bad case.

28:18.209 --> 28:21.208
She was covered in blood.
I've never seen such a sight.

28:21.292 --> 28:23.208
She must have cut a vein or an artery.

28:23.292 --> 28:26.666
I had such a time stopping it.
I've never seen bIeeding Iike that.

28:26.750 --> 28:30.041
I didn't know what to do at first,
but, at last, I managed to stop it.

28:30.125 --> 28:33.833
A minute would have fetched Sister Briony,
who would have stopped it at once.

28:33.959 --> 28:37.666
- I told you to stay in bed.
- I was only trying to consider you, Sister Briony.

28:37.750 --> 28:42.124
It might have been better to have considered
the woman, who was bIeeding to death.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.624
Shall I wait?

28:47.709 --> 28:49.749
We are coming in a moment.

28:49.834 --> 28:52.166
I think you'd better go back to your room.

29:00.709 --> 29:03.791
Goodbye, Sister. I hope your patient does well.

29:03.875 --> 29:05.499
Who is she?

29:05.584 --> 29:08.999
It sounded like Samuel,
but it couldn't be, could it?

29:09.084 --> 29:12.166
Oh, Samil, she's a good old soul,
one of my best workers.

29:12.250 --> 29:14.124
I'm very much obliged to you.

29:15.334 --> 29:16.999
Thank you.

29:30.500 --> 29:32.249
(Nuns gasp)

29:40.750 --> 29:43.333
Now the old place is a pukka convent.

30:12.042 --> 30:14.166
Hello, Sister Ruth. Going for a walk?

30:14.250 --> 30:16.291
It's time to ring the bell.

30:16.375 --> 30:18.041
You're slipping.

30:19.917 --> 30:21.999
A quarter of an hour early.

30:28.292 --> 30:29.749
Thank you.

30:37.125 --> 30:39.708
I came to ask Mr Dean to wait in the Blue Room.

30:39.792 --> 30:43.499
- How did you know he was here?
- I saw him from the schoolroom.

30:46.792 --> 30:49.083
I've brought something for you.

31:02.834 --> 31:06.166
Her name is Hirsempal, but we caII her Kanchi.

31:07.292 --> 31:09.374
She's 1 7. She's an orphan.

31:10.959 --> 31:12.999
And it's high time she was married.

31:13.084 --> 31:16.874
Every evening when I come home,
I find her sitting on my veranda.

31:16.959 --> 31:19.791
She dresses herself up, puts flowers in her hair.

31:19.875 --> 31:21.958
Becoming an absolute nuisance.

31:23.042 --> 31:26.124
lf she is cloistered for a few months,
her uncIe will marry her off,

31:26.209 --> 31:28.791
but she's been behaving so badIy
that no-one wants her.

31:28.875 --> 31:31.166
I don't think we want her, either.

31:32.834 --> 31:34.874
Why did you bring her to us?

31:34.959 --> 31:37.374
Isn't it your business to save souls?

31:37.459 --> 31:40.291
You are not to speak to me like that, Mr Dean.

31:40.375 --> 31:41.833
Sorry.

31:43.250 --> 31:45.458
Can't she go into some sort of service?

31:46.500 --> 31:48.583
She'd set any house by the ears.

31:49.625 --> 31:53.041
I thought no-one would have patience with her.
Except you.

31:57.959 --> 32:00.874
Would you ask Sister Briony
to come here, please?

32:03.959 --> 32:05.624
(Whistles) Kanchi!

32:20.292 --> 32:21.708
Kanchi.

32:21.792 --> 32:23.874
(Asks her to make a salaam)

32:59.709 --> 33:02.958
You're sure there's no question
you're dying to ask me?

33:05.584 --> 33:07.041
None.

33:12.000 --> 33:13.583
You wanted me, Sister?

33:13.709 --> 33:18.291
I have agreed to have this girl with us for a
while. Can you find somewhere for her to sleep?

33:19.459 --> 33:21.291
What is she to do?

33:21.375 --> 33:24.124
Sister Honey can take her into the lace school.

33:25.209 --> 33:26.208
Yes...

33:26.292 --> 33:28.749
Tell Ayah to give her some housework.
Keep her busy.

33:32.875 --> 33:34.416
Come along.

33:54.667 --> 33:56.166
Well, thanks.

33:56.250 --> 33:58.791
The Young General's death,
is the General grieving?

33:58.875 --> 34:00.666
You can never tell with these people.

34:00.750 --> 34:03.958
- What's the new Young General's name?
- Dilip. Dilip Rai.

34:04.042 --> 34:07.666
He was going to Cambridge.
Now he'll be a warrior and marry young.

34:07.750 --> 34:10.958
It'll suit him, all right,
these Rai are a fighting race.

34:11.917 --> 34:15.041
- Gun.
CHILDREN: Gun.

34:16.083 --> 34:17.873
Warship.

34:17.958 --> 34:19.748
CHILDREN: Warship.

34:20.792 --> 34:24.083
JOSEPH: Bayonet.
CHILDREN: Bayonet.

34:25.125 --> 34:26.708
Dagger.

34:26.792 --> 34:28.248
CHILDREN: Dagger.

34:40.333 --> 34:42.416
- Gun.
CHILDREN: Gun.

34:47.208 --> 34:50.333
You know, we may have
to mix something with it.

34:51.417 --> 34:53.498
Here. Let me have a look.

35:28.959 --> 35:31.791
Hail Mary, full of grace, blessed is the...

35:34.625 --> 35:36.708
(Bell continues to ring)

35:55.875 --> 35:57.416
Sister?

35:58.459 --> 36:00.541
Did you hear the bell?

36:05.917 --> 36:10.166
This morning, in chapel,
I suddenly had the feeling you were not with us.

36:11.209 --> 36:13.458
- I try hard enough.
- Try what?

36:14.584 --> 36:16.749
I used to forget everything in chapel.

36:16.834 --> 36:20.124
I used to feel light and happy and...near God.

36:20.209 --> 36:21.749
Let me help you.

36:21.834 --> 36:23.624
What is worrying you?

36:24.667 --> 36:27.291
I remember things, before I joined our order.

36:28.334 --> 36:30.124
Things I wanted to forget.

36:31.209 --> 36:33.249
I never thought of them until now.

36:33.334 --> 36:36.291
I've been 21 years in the Order and...

36:36.375 --> 36:38.458
now they come back to me.

36:40.625 --> 36:42.708
I think you can see too far.

36:43.750 --> 36:45.416
I look out there and...

36:46.459 --> 36:48.958
..then I can't see the potato I'm planting.

36:50.084 --> 36:54.041
And, after a bit, it doesn't seem to matter
whether I plant it or not.

36:55.334 --> 36:57.166
It's this place,

36:57.250 --> 37:00.083
with its strange atmosphere and new people.

37:01.500 --> 37:05.124
Stay with me tonight, after chapel,
and we will pray together.

37:05.209 --> 37:07.041
And work, Sister, work hard.

37:07.125 --> 37:10.333
Work until you're too tired
to think of anything else.

37:38.792 --> 37:41.208
(Remembers) Oh, isn't it a grand day, Con?

37:56.167 --> 37:58.208
Con, isn't it a grand day?

37:58.292 --> 37:59.749
Mm.

38:08.792 --> 38:11.083
- What's wrong?
- Everything.

38:11.167 --> 38:13.708
- What especially?
- Oh, nothing.

38:13.792 --> 38:15.874
You wouldn't understand.

38:17.334 --> 38:19.166
Is it money, Con?

38:19.250 --> 38:21.083
Whatever else is it?

38:21.167 --> 38:23.666
Desmond is well out of it in Michigan.

38:25.209 --> 38:27.249
I heard from him last week.

38:27.334 --> 38:29.374
He's been made a partner.

38:29.459 --> 38:33.583
Just because I'm the eldest son,
I have to stay here in Ireland all my life

38:33.667 --> 38:36.166
and hang around waiting for...this.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.874
I'll have a little money, Con. When I marry.

38:44.959 --> 38:49.541
It isn't "a little money" it wants, it's a fortune,
and then it would be a waste.

38:51.500 --> 38:54.749
Clo, don't you sometimes itch to get away?

38:56.125 --> 38:58.166
No, I don't want to go away.

38:58.250 --> 39:01.499
I want to stay here like this for the rest of my life.

39:07.875 --> 39:09.541
(Dog whines)

39:10.875 --> 39:12.541
(Dog barks)

40:07.417 --> 40:09.499
(Dog continues to bark)

40:12.625 --> 40:14.708
MAN: Ayah! Angu Ayah!

40:16.500 --> 40:18.124
(Horse bells jingle)

40:18.209 --> 40:19.874
(Calls to servant)

40:24.542 --> 40:26.624
(Dog continues to bark)

40:47.292 --> 40:49.166
Ayah! Angu Ayah!

40:54.375 --> 40:57.166
Salaam, my Little General.

40:57.250 --> 40:59.333
I want to see the Reverend Sisters.

41:06.500 --> 41:11.166
Why are they called "the servants of Mary"?
Is the Superior Sister called Mary?

41:12.209 --> 41:14.249
Ask her. Here she comes.

41:14.334 --> 41:16.624
Go now. I will speak to her alone.

41:26.459 --> 41:28.708
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

41:28.792 --> 41:31.041
I want to see the Superior Sister.

41:31.125 --> 41:33.166
I am the Sister Superior.

41:33.250 --> 41:34.416
Oh.

41:34.500 --> 41:36.541
I want to be a student here with you.

41:36.625 --> 41:38.666
I want to study a lot of learning.

41:38.750 --> 41:42.374
I want to study mathematics,
history, poetry and languages.

41:42.459 --> 41:45.458
I have a note from my uncle
to ask you to encourage me.

41:45.542 --> 41:48.749
I'm very sorry.
We only teach children and young girls.

41:48.834 --> 41:50.249
Why?

41:50.334 --> 41:52.583
Convents don't teach men pupils.

41:52.667 --> 41:56.624
- That's not very polite to men.
- We don't mean it that way. It's the custom.

41:56.709 --> 42:00.208
Convents are for girls.
The brotherhoods are for men.

42:03.667 --> 42:05.749
Jesus Christ was a man.

42:07.250 --> 42:09.541
He took the shape of a man.

42:11.500 --> 42:13.624
But you don't need to count me as a man.

42:13.709 --> 42:15.999
I'm only interested in studious things.

42:16.125 --> 42:20.041
Please, Sister? I have written out my timetable.
May I read it to you?

42:20.125 --> 42:23.291
5am to 7am:
algebra with the mathematical Sister.

42:23.375 --> 42:27.083
8am to 1 0am: reIigion, especially Christianity,
with the scriptural Sister.

42:27.167 --> 42:28.583
1 0am art.

42:28.667 --> 42:33.624
1 pm to 3pm: French and Russian
with the French and Russian Sisters, if any.

42:33.709 --> 42:37.041
3pm to 4pm: Physics with the physical Sister.

42:42.792 --> 42:44.874
(The Young General calls his servant)

43:38.584 --> 43:40.124
(Door opens)

43:42.000 --> 43:44.791
SISTER CLODAGH:
Please wait in here, General.

44:30.125 --> 44:33.333
Aren't you afraid
that you've let a cuckoo into your nest?

44:33.417 --> 44:36.624
We didn't want to offend the General.
He might turn us out.

44:36.709 --> 44:38.374
He wouldn't do that.

44:39.417 --> 44:41.458
You may have trouble with Kanchi.

44:41.542 --> 44:43.083
Kanchi?

44:44.334 --> 44:45.999
She'd never dare.

44:47.042 --> 44:48.874
After all, he is a prince

44:48.959 --> 44:50.999
and she is...what she is.

44:51.084 --> 44:55.083
Still, I expect she knows the story
of The Prince And The Beggar Maid.

44:55.167 --> 44:57.208
..40, 41 , 42,

44:57.292 --> 44:59.333
43, 44,

44:59.417 --> 45:01.458
45, 46,

45:01.542 --> 45:03.583
47, 48,

45:03.667 --> 45:04.874
49.

45:04.959 --> 45:06.999
When the General gave us the deeds,

45:07.084 --> 45:10.083
our boundary line
was to be 500 yards round the building.

45:10.167 --> 45:13.666
- That's right.
- So, the Holy Man is living on our ground.

45:13.750 --> 45:15.499
He was here first.

45:15.584 --> 45:19.083
Yes, but, Mr Dean,
I find all these things very distracting.

45:19.167 --> 45:20.583
Distracting?

45:20.667 --> 45:22.499
Yes. Disturbing.

45:22.584 --> 45:24.208
This clear air

45:24.292 --> 45:26.291
and the wind always blowing

45:26.417 --> 45:30.124
and the mountain and the Holy Man sitting there,
day in and day out

45:30.209 --> 45:32.249
and the people coming to see him.

45:32.334 --> 45:36.249
They climb the path by the house
and they stop and sit and stare at us.

45:36.334 --> 45:38.166
What do you want to do about it?

45:38.250 --> 45:40.124
Ask the General to ask the Holy Man to move.

45:40.250 --> 45:44.374
- I couldn't. It wouldn't be polite.
- I don't suppose the General knows he's there.

45:44.459 --> 45:47.374
Oh, yes, he does.
That old man worries him quite a bit.

45:47.500 --> 45:52.416
Particularly when he's in the middle of his dinner
or when he's trying on a new frock coat.

45:52.500 --> 45:53.958
Why?

45:54.042 --> 45:57.208
Well, I suppose he feels
he ought to go and do likewise.

45:57.292 --> 45:59.041
Then he wouldn't turn him out?

45:59.125 --> 46:03.041
Well, it would be a bit awkward
for the General to turn out his own uncle.

46:03.125 --> 46:04.541
His uncle?

46:04.625 --> 46:06.999
General Sir Krishna Rai.

46:07.084 --> 46:09.124
KCVO, KCSI, CMG.

46:09.209 --> 46:11.583
He has several foreign decorations, too.

46:11.667 --> 46:14.333
He lent our General the money to buy this place.

46:14.417 --> 46:18.624
l've never heard him talk.
They say he speaks perfect EngIish.

46:18.709 --> 46:21.083
Several other European languages, too.

46:25.542 --> 46:27.583
Does he never speak at all?

46:27.667 --> 46:29.416
I've never heard him.

46:29.500 --> 46:31.958
- When does he eat or sleep?
- No-one knows.

46:32.042 --> 46:34.291
He's always in his place under the tree.

46:34.375 --> 46:36.458
People come miles to see him.

46:53.667 --> 46:55.749
Well, I really don't know what to do.

46:56.792 --> 46:58.666
What would Christ have done?

47:09.834 --> 47:11.916
(Bells jingle)

47:24.917 --> 47:28.166
- Good morning, General.
- Good morning, Sister Honey.

47:30.125 --> 47:32.208
Good morning, Sister Ruth.

48:13.542 --> 48:15.083
(Sniffs)

48:20.125 --> 48:22.166
Do you like it, Sister Ruth?

48:22.250 --> 48:24.291
It's called Black Narcissus.

48:24.375 --> 48:27.208
It comes from the Army and Navy Stores
in London.

48:28.542 --> 48:30.249
Black Narcissus?

48:30.334 --> 48:32.374
I don't like scent, at all.

48:32.459 --> 48:36.999
Oh, Sister, don't you think it's rather common
to smell of ourselves?

48:44.084 --> 48:46.124
Have you seen the Young General today?

48:46.209 --> 48:48.833
- What's the latest?
- Emeralds. Beautiful emeralds.

48:48.917 --> 48:51.333
The deepest, most beautiful green
l've ever seen.

48:51.417 --> 48:53.791
At that hour in the morning,
they make me biIious.

48:53.875 --> 48:57.083
Have you seen his coats?
A different one for every day in the year!

48:57.167 --> 48:59.541
He's lucky he doesn't have to do
his own laundry.

48:59.625 --> 49:03.333
Yesterday, a coat the colour of ripe corn,
patterned with flowers and damask.

49:03.459 --> 49:07.249
His earrings were amethysts, three inches long,
and his rings were turquoise.

49:07.375 --> 49:12.416
Today, he's aII jade and emeralds and his coat
is a most wonderfuI pattern of paIe vioIet stripes,

49:12.500 --> 49:16.374
worked entireIy in petit point,
just Iike my grandmother's footstool!

49:28.000 --> 49:30.083
Oh, Granny!

49:31.125 --> 49:32.791
Turn round.

49:34.750 --> 49:38.416
These emeralds are for you, my darling,
when you marry.

49:40.292 --> 49:41.749
There.

49:52.834 --> 49:54.624
(Whistling)

49:55.667 --> 49:57.166
There's Con.

49:57.250 --> 49:59.333
Good night, everybody!

50:05.542 --> 50:06.874
Not too late, darling.

50:07.750 --> 50:10.874
MOTHER: I hope they get something settled
by the winter.

50:19.209 --> 50:20.958
Where are you, Con?

50:21.042 --> 50:25.833
SISTER RUTH: He said it was called Black
Narcissus, from the Army and Navy Stores.

50:28.042 --> 50:29.583
Black Narcissus!

50:31.209 --> 50:34.958
That's what I'm going to call him.
It's a wonderful name for him.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.041
He's so vain, like a peacock.

50:38.125 --> 50:39.874
A fine, black peacock.

50:39.959 --> 50:42.541
- He's not Black.
- They all Iook alike to me.

50:47.417 --> 50:50.124
General, please conjugate s'asseoir.

50:55.334 --> 50:56.999
Je m'assieds.

50:58.125 --> 51:00.166
Tu t'assieds.

51:00.250 --> 51:02.333
ll s'assied.

Thank you, General.

54:49.709 --> 54:52.291
I hope you don't mind my coming tonight.

I am very much interested in Jesus Christ.

54:58.959 --> 55:01.124
Have I said anything wrong?

55:02.209 --> 55:03.708
No, but...

55:03.792 --> 55:06.666
we don't usually speak of Him so casually.

55:06.750 --> 55:08.624
MR DEAN: And you shouId!

55:09.667 --> 55:13.541
He should be casual and as much
a part of life as...your daily bread.

55:22.750 --> 55:24.999
How dare you come here like this!

55:25.084 --> 55:27.624
How dare you come to our service tonight.

55:27.709 --> 55:30.166
You're... You're unforgivable!

55:30.250 --> 55:34.208
You're objectionable when you're sober
and abominable when you're drunk.

55:41.000 --> 55:42.666
I quite agree.

55:43.875 --> 55:48.583

56:20.250 --> 56:22.499
It's so nice and loud.

56:22.584 --> 56:25.083
I think it's lovely, don't you?

56:27.334 --> 56:30.249
- Good night, General.
- Good night, Sister Clodagh.

56:54.167 --> 56:55.833
(Knock at door)
- Come in!

57:04.084 --> 57:05.708
I want to talk to you.

57:05.792 --> 57:07.458
Come and sit down.

57:11.459 --> 57:14.291
I've been worried about you for some time.

57:14.375 --> 57:17.083
I feel that things are not right with you.

57:17.167 --> 57:18.791
In what way?

57:18.875 --> 57:21.666
You Iook so ill and you've got so terribIy thin.

57:21.750 --> 57:24.999
I know that you're trying to keep up,
for all our sakes,

57:25.084 --> 57:28.374
but I feel that you really must go
and see the doctor.

57:28.459 --> 57:31.208
I shan't see the doctor!
I'm perfectly well. You know it.

57:31.292 --> 57:33.374
You're just trying to make out that...

57:38.459 --> 57:40.083
I didn't mean...

57:40.167 --> 57:41.708
to be rude.

57:43.375 --> 57:45.541
I haven't been sleeping, that's all.

57:47.625 --> 57:51.249
If you haven't been sleeping,
there must be some reason for it.

57:51.334 --> 57:52.999
Can't you tell me?

57:54.500 --> 57:57.041
Is something worrying you?

57:57.125 --> 57:58.541
Yes.

57:58.625 --> 58:00.291
Yes, that's it.

58:01.334 --> 58:02.874
I'm worried.

58:04.125 --> 58:06.541
Don't you think you could tell me about it?

58:12.584 --> 58:14.666
I'd like you to tell me, if you can.

58:16.375 --> 58:18.041
I can't speak of it.

58:19.459 --> 58:21.083
To anyone.

58:21.167 --> 58:23.499
Won't you try? You know you can trust me.

58:23.584 --> 58:25.624
You didn't want me to come here.

58:25.709 --> 58:27.791
None of you have ever wanted me here.

58:29.709 --> 58:33.041
Don't you think
you're letting things run away with you?

58:37.584 --> 58:39.249
I think...

58:40.459 --> 58:44.624
..you have let yourself fall into thinking
too much of Mr Dean.

58:48.417 --> 58:49.916
Sister...

58:50.000 --> 58:52.124
Don't you realise what you're doing?

58:52.209 --> 58:55.208
What you're running the risk
of losing in yourself?

58:55.292 --> 58:57.124
Sister, you must...

58:57.209 --> 58:59.833
I must make you see, before it is too Iate.

58:59.917 --> 59:03.333
All the same, I've noticed
you're very pleased to see him, yourself.

59:07.500 --> 59:11.624
If that was in your mind, it's better said.
I think you're out of your senses.

59:11.709 --> 59:15.333
Listen to me. l don't know,
I can't decide now what to make of you.

59:15.417 --> 59:17.249
I shall have to think.

59:17.334 --> 59:19.624
And I want you to think, too.

59:20.709 --> 59:22.374
As for Mr Dean...

59:24.250 --> 59:27.416
In spite of his charm and kindliness,
he is not a good man.

59:27.500 --> 59:32.083
You must take him for what he is and not try
to glorify him into something he is not.

59:33.125 --> 59:35.749
When he came to chapel on Christmas night,
he was drunk.

59:37.209 --> 59:38.749
Can I go?

59:41.750 --> 59:43.958
I want you to write to Reverend Mother.

59:45.292 --> 59:49.124
I shan't look at the letter
and her reply will be your own business.

59:49.209 --> 59:50.833
Am I to write two or three pages?

59:50.917 --> 59:53.874
Would you rather I did it now
or finish my class work first?

59:58.334 --> 59:59.999
You may go.

01:00:08.459 --> 01:00:09.999
(Slams door)

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.041
That parcel is mine! Give it to me.

01:01:14.125 --> 01:01:17.374
I can't. I must give all the mail to Sister Clodagh.

01:01:17.459 --> 01:01:19.791
It's mine. Give it to me, you little fool.

01:01:19.875 --> 01:01:23.999
Can't you see? It's addressed to me.
I ordered it myself from Calcutta.

01:01:24.084 --> 01:01:26.166
It's nothing to do with anyone else.

01:01:32.875 --> 01:01:37.083
Sister Briony, do you know what's happened
to the other gold chain off this censer?

01:01:37.167 --> 01:01:39.541
No. It was there
when we had it out at Christmas.

01:01:39.625 --> 01:01:42.374
- Well, it isn't here now.
- Ask Kanchi if she's seen it.

01:01:42.459 --> 01:01:44.333
(Screams)

01:01:44.417 --> 01:01:47.499
And that...is for stealing in my house.

01:01:48.542 --> 01:01:52.041
(Kanchi screams again)
- That's for stealing a brass chain.

01:01:52.125 --> 01:01:55.166
That's for steaIing it in such a silly way.

01:01:55.250 --> 01:01:56.874
And that...

01:01:56.959 --> 01:02:00.291
(Kanchi screams again)
- ..is for getting found out.

01:02:18.834 --> 01:02:20.874
What has the girl done?

01:02:20.959 --> 01:02:27.208
She's a thief. She stole a brass chain
from the church to put round her dirty neck.

01:02:28.292 --> 01:02:31.583
Finish the beating, my Little General Bahadur.

01:02:31.667 --> 01:02:33.916
You're going to be a great man.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.958
Not like your uncIe, oh, dear, no.

01:02:37.042 --> 01:02:39.291
Like your grandfather.

01:02:39.375 --> 01:02:41.916
Ha ha! He was a man.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.624
Finish the beating and begin to be a man!

01:02:49.334 --> 01:02:51.416
(Kanchi sobbing)

01:02:55.875 --> 01:02:57.958
Get up.

01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:57.124
Forget-me-not.

01:03:57.209 --> 01:03:59.291
CHILDREN: Forget-me-not.

01:04:00.125 --> 01:04:01.624
Sweet pea.

01:04:01.709 --> 01:04:03.791
CHILDREN: Sweet pea.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.624
JOSEPH: Daffodil.

01:04:07.709 --> 01:04:09.791
CHILDREN: Daffodil.

01:04:11.792 --> 01:04:14.749
JOSEPH: Japanese peony.

01:04:15.792 --> 01:04:18.624
CHILDREN: Japanese peony.

01:04:19.792 --> 01:04:21.833
JOSEPH: Chinese IiIy.

01:04:21.917 --> 01:04:25.041
CHILDREN: Chinese lily.

01:04:26.084 --> 01:04:29.124
- Tulip.
CHILDREN: Tulip.

01:04:29.209 --> 01:04:30.833
Honeysuckle.

01:04:30.917 --> 01:04:33.541
CHILDREN: Honeysuckle.

01:04:33.625 --> 01:04:35.333
Honeysuckle.

01:04:37.375 --> 01:04:40.041
Delphin-i-um.

01:04:40.125 --> 01:04:43.708
- Sister Honey!
CHILDREN: Delphin-i-um.

01:04:43.792 --> 01:04:46.583
Will you find Sister Philippa for me, please?

01:04:48.042 --> 01:04:50.499
- And the cabbage patch?
- Foxgloves.

01:04:50.584 --> 01:04:53.124
- And the runner beans?
- Honeysuckle.

01:04:53.209 --> 01:04:54.833
And the onions?

01:04:54.917 --> 01:04:56.374
Tulips.

01:04:57.750 --> 01:05:00.124
And the potatoes? All flowers?

01:05:03.125 --> 01:05:05.166
No, not the little round bed.

01:05:05.250 --> 01:05:09.749
And there are some more vegetables,
down by the stables, where they won't show.

01:05:09.834 --> 01:05:12.083
But what on earth came over you...

01:05:15.792 --> 01:05:17.874
Would you like to sit down?

01:05:20.042 --> 01:05:22.999
Sister, I want to be transferred.

01:05:24.875 --> 01:05:26.374
Transferred?

01:05:26.459 --> 01:05:29.916
Yes, I want you, if you will,
to write and ask for my transfer at once.

01:05:31.834 --> 01:05:33.916
If you will. At once.

01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:37.124
But why?

01:05:37.209 --> 01:05:39.583
I was becoming too fond of the place.

01:05:41.209 --> 01:05:43.291
I was too wrapped up in my work. I...

01:05:44.792 --> 01:05:46.833
I thought too much about it.

01:05:46.917 --> 01:05:48.583
I'd forgotten.

01:05:49.834 --> 01:05:51.916
Forgotten what?

01:05:52.959 --> 01:05:54.583
What I am.

01:05:54.667 --> 01:05:57.083
I was losing the spirit of our Order.

01:05:58.334 --> 01:06:00.833
I've been thinking it over, you see, and...

01:06:01.875 --> 01:06:03.541
I must go at once.

01:06:06.917 --> 01:06:08.999
I don't see that at all.

01:06:10.792 --> 01:06:14.249
Now that you know and you realise the danger,
you needn't go.

01:06:15.292 --> 01:06:17.124
Surely, now is the time to stay.

01:06:17.209 --> 01:06:18.874
I daren't stay.

01:06:20.250 --> 01:06:23.458
I think there are only two ways
of living in this place.

01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:27.083
Either, you must live like Mr Dean or...

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.874
or like the Holy Man.

01:06:31.042 --> 01:06:33.749
Either ignore it or give yourself up to it.

01:06:36.625 --> 01:06:38.666
Neither would do for us.

01:06:38.750 --> 01:06:40.208
No.

01:06:41.917 --> 01:06:46.416
Well, we are here and I don't think
it will help matters if we run away.

01:06:48.792 --> 01:06:50.874
(Horn)

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:57.249
You know if I ask for you to be transferred,
it'll be a bad mark against you?

01:06:57.334 --> 01:06:59.249
That's all the better.

01:07:00.292 --> 01:07:02.166
That's what I need.

01:07:04.459 --> 01:07:06.541
Ayah! Ayah!

01:07:23.875 --> 01:07:25.499
(Asks question)

01:07:25.584 --> 01:07:28.291
- What did she say, Ayah?
- Give him something.

01:07:29.334 --> 01:07:31.416
It's Om's little brother.

01:07:32.875 --> 01:07:34.916
Shall we give him magnesia?

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.416
Or some of the paraffin emulsion?

01:07:46.542 --> 01:07:48.083
1 03!

01:07:49.125 --> 01:07:53.083
That's not much in a baby, is it?
I mean, they go up and down easily, don't they?

01:07:53.167 --> 01:07:54.624
(Asks a question)

01:07:54.709 --> 01:07:55.708
(Replies)

01:07:55.792 --> 01:08:00.291
He's been like it three days. This morning,
he wouldn't wake, so she brought him.

01:08:01.917 --> 01:08:05.833
Let him sleep. Take him home
and put him on your bed and let him sleep.

01:08:05.917 --> 01:08:09.291
(Translates instructions)

01:08:11.584 --> 01:08:13.749
Aren't you going to give him anything?

01:08:13.834 --> 01:08:15.708
There's nothing I can do.

01:08:16.750 --> 01:08:19.541
But there must be something we can do.

01:08:20.584 --> 01:08:22.332
At least, bathe his eyes

01:08:22.417 --> 01:08:24.582
or relieve his tummy with a little oil.

01:08:24.667 --> 01:08:28.291
I daren't touch him, Sister.
I don't think he feels any pain.

01:08:28.375 --> 01:08:30.207
You can see how it must hurt him.

01:08:30.292 --> 01:08:34.457
You're afraid of what Mr Dean said.
You'll give up his life without a struggle!

01:08:34.542 --> 01:08:36.166
That's enough, Sister!

01:08:36.250 --> 01:08:39.499
I won't have any hysteria from you.
I know what I'm doing.

01:08:40.750 --> 01:08:45.416
The kindest thing you can do is to make her go
home where she'll be amongst her own people.

01:08:49.250 --> 01:08:51.332
Lemini? Lemini?

01:09:07.250 --> 01:09:08.791
Sister Ruth!

01:09:11.042 --> 01:09:13.082
Everyone is very late this morning.

01:09:13.167 --> 01:09:15.249
I do hope nothing's happened.

01:09:18.667 --> 01:09:22.082
Joseph, go down the path and hurry them up.

01:09:23.917 --> 01:09:25.416
Well, go on.

01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:27.124
I don't want to.

01:09:27.209 --> 01:09:30.624
- You don't want to?
- Why don't you want to?

01:09:30.709 --> 01:09:33.166
How dare you answer me like that! Go at once.

01:09:33.250 --> 01:09:35.082
No, I won't go.

01:09:35.167 --> 01:09:36.666
Joseph!

01:09:36.750 --> 01:09:39.249
Now, stand still. Tell me what's the matter!

01:09:39.334 --> 01:09:41.666
- Don't frighten him.
- He knows something.

01:09:41.750 --> 01:09:45.124
- Joseph, why haven't the children come?
- Where are they?

01:09:45.209 --> 01:09:47.041
He knows why. Tell us.

01:09:47.125 --> 01:09:50.124
I don't want to. Lemini, don't make me tell.

01:09:50.209 --> 01:09:52.874
Joseph, you must tell us. Please, Joseph, dear.

01:09:52.959 --> 01:09:55.749
- Tell us.
- The little baby is dead!

01:09:55.834 --> 01:09:59.124
SISTER HONEY: Oh, no.
- Our little brother is dead.

01:09:59.209 --> 01:10:02.416
And they say that a Lemini killed him!

01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:04.791
ALL: Sister Clodagh!
- Nobody in the dispensary.

01:10:04.875 --> 01:10:06.791
- No children have come.
- No gardeners.

01:10:06.875 --> 01:10:09.124
- Kanchi has gone.
- So has the Young General.

01:10:09.209 --> 01:10:12.791
- Not a servant in the place.
- We're all alone. There's no-one in the house.

01:10:13.917 --> 01:10:15.499
It was my fault.

01:10:15.584 --> 01:10:18.666
Because I loved him.
Because I couldn't bear to see him die.

01:10:18.750 --> 01:10:20.416
I did it. I killed him!

01:10:22.209 --> 01:10:26.124
I gave her a bottle to take away,
some cotton wool and one of our spoons.

01:10:26.209 --> 01:10:28.041
I killed him! I killed him!

01:10:28.125 --> 01:10:29.499
Ayah!

01:10:30.625 --> 01:10:34.166
- Ayah, how much of this is true?
- All true. The people are very angry.

01:10:34.292 --> 01:10:38.749
We must explain. Somebody must tell them.
The Young General, surely he hasn't run away?

01:10:38.834 --> 01:10:40.583
No. He's run away with Kanchi.

01:10:40.667 --> 01:10:42.708
Ayah, will you take a message to the village?

01:10:42.792 --> 01:10:44.374
Me? No.

01:10:44.459 --> 01:10:46.083
Well, can Joseph?

01:10:46.167 --> 01:10:49.041
- He can go, but they won't Iet him come back.
- I'll go.

01:10:49.125 --> 01:10:51.291
It's not safe for you to go outside the garden.

01:10:52.375 --> 01:10:55.916
- You can't go, Sister. It's far too dangerous.
- I'm not going down.

01:11:06.834 --> 01:11:08.916
(Animals call out)

01:11:21.542 --> 01:11:23.624
(Bell continues to ring)

01:11:26.084 --> 01:11:27.624
(Calls servant)

01:11:30.167 --> 01:11:32.041
My clothing, quickly!

01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:38.166
Well? Who was it?

01:11:39.792 --> 01:11:41.916
Oh, you.

01:11:45.334 --> 01:11:49.333
Mr Dean, do you think it's serious?
Don't you think they'll come back?

01:11:49.459 --> 01:11:54.624
Sister Clodagh, the agent before my time was
riding down to the factory one day on his pony.

01:11:54.709 --> 01:11:57.999
He let it kick an umbrella
that was lying open in the path.

01:11:58.084 --> 01:12:01.041
There was a child asleep under it
and it was killed.

01:12:01.125 --> 01:12:02.958
It was just an accident,

01:12:03.042 --> 01:12:05.124
but they murdered him that night.

01:12:06.542 --> 01:12:10.999
I'm not trying to frighten you,
but I want you to see that it may be serious.

01:12:11.084 --> 01:12:13.124
The village seems quiet enough.

01:12:13.209 --> 01:12:16.166
SISTER CLODAGH: Did they say anything?
- Nothing.

01:12:16.250 --> 01:12:18.374
They listened to me and said nothing.

01:12:18.459 --> 01:12:23.291
I saw the woman. I drank the stuff that
Sister Honey was foolish enough to give her.

01:12:23.375 --> 01:12:24.874
You drank it?

01:12:24.959 --> 01:12:29.458
I wanted to prove to them that I wouldn't
drop down dead. It was only castor oil.

01:12:30.500 --> 01:12:34.624
Now, none of you must go out of the garden.
Behave as though nothing has happened.

01:12:34.709 --> 01:12:36.999
I'll go down now and come back this evening.

01:13:06.917 --> 01:13:19.374
Lemini?

01:13:24.542 --> 01:13:26.624
Lemini.

01:13:27.667 --> 01:13:30.416
- What's that for?
- For you, Lemini.

01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:32.583
Who sent it? Sister Clodagh?

01:15:09.959 --> 01:15:11.833
(Horn echoes)

01:15:15.750 --> 01:15:18.458
Do you notice a change in us
since we came here?

01:15:19.500 --> 01:15:21.541
I notice a change in you.

01:15:21.625 --> 01:15:23.708
Am I very different?

01:15:24.750 --> 01:15:26.083
Yes.

01:15:28.542 --> 01:15:30.166
You're much nicer.

01:15:30.250 --> 01:15:31.874
- Nicer?
- Mm.

01:15:31.959 --> 01:15:33.583
You're human.

01:15:33.667 --> 01:15:35.124
Human?

01:15:36.750 --> 01:15:38.833
Yes, we're all human, aren't we?

01:15:43.709 --> 01:15:45.791
When I was a girl, I loved a man.

01:15:46.834 --> 01:15:50.124
We were children together in Ireland,
where I come from.

01:15:50.209 --> 01:15:52.291
A little place called Enniskelly.

01:15:53.334 --> 01:15:54.958
I thought...

01:15:55.042 --> 01:15:57.624
Everyone thought we should marry.

01:15:58.750 --> 01:16:00.499
But he was ambitious

01:16:00.584 --> 01:16:04.041
and I found out he was going to America,
to his uncle.

01:16:05.584 --> 01:16:07.666
And he didn't intend to take me.

01:16:09.917 --> 01:16:12.458
He didn't think he was doing anything wrong.

01:16:12.542 --> 01:16:15.124
I don't think he ever thought of us marrying.

01:16:16.167 --> 01:16:18.249
But in a little place like that...

01:16:19.292 --> 01:16:21.374
..and I had shown I loved him.

01:16:22.709 --> 01:16:24.791
I had to get away first.

01:16:26.292 --> 01:16:28.583
And that's why you entered the order?

01:16:31.209 --> 01:16:34.041
And, being you, you wouldn't go back?

01:16:35.334 --> 01:16:37.499
It was a strange way of bringing me in.

01:16:38.542 --> 01:16:40.624
But God works in strange ways.

01:16:41.667 --> 01:16:43.291
I had work to do

01:16:43.375 --> 01:16:44.999
and I had the life.

01:16:45.084 --> 01:16:48.041
No-one outside
can possibly know what that means.

01:16:48.125 --> 01:16:49.958
It came to be my life.

01:16:50.042 --> 01:16:53.166
I had forgotten everything until I came here.

01:16:57.834 --> 01:17:01.583
The first day I came
I thought of him for the first time for years.

01:17:03.667 --> 01:17:07.499
I seem to go back to the first time I loved him
when we were children.

01:17:09.459 --> 01:17:11.833
The Young General reminds me of him, too.

01:17:13.792 --> 01:17:16.499
The world comes thrusting in behind him.

01:17:18.209 --> 01:17:20.499
I've been drifting and dreaming and...

01:17:21.542 --> 01:17:25.958
(Voice breaks) Now I seem to be living through
the struggle and the bitterness again.

01:17:31.584 --> 01:17:32.874
Here.

01:17:32.959 --> 01:17:35.749
It's quite clean. I washed my hair this morning.

01:17:40.125 --> 01:17:45.333
Don't take on so, there's a good girl.
It'll all blow over. There's nothing really wrong.

01:17:46.667 --> 01:17:48.708
Sister Philippa is leaving.

01:17:48.792 --> 01:17:51.874
And this morning I had a letter
from Reverend Mother.

01:17:51.959 --> 01:17:54.291
Sister Ruth is giving up the Order.

01:17:54.375 --> 01:17:56.624
She has not renewed her vows.

01:17:56.709 --> 01:17:58.249
I'm sorry.

01:17:58.334 --> 01:17:59.958
And you.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.041
Ever since we came here,

01:18:03.125 --> 01:18:08.416
over all our troubles, it's been,
"Ask Mr Dean, ask Mr Dean."

01:18:08.500 --> 01:18:11.166
There was just no-one else you could ask.

01:18:13.417 --> 01:18:15.874
Well, I had to take the Young General.

01:18:15.959 --> 01:18:17.999
I couldn't turn out the Holy Man.

01:18:18.084 --> 01:18:23.249
I couldn't stop the wind from blowing
and the air from being as clear as crystal.

01:18:23.334 --> 01:18:25.208
I couldn't hide the mountain.

01:18:26.584 --> 01:18:29.708
Look, you must get away from here,
all of you, at once.

01:18:31.459 --> 01:18:33.874
- Run away?
- Yes, if you've got any sense.

01:18:34.917 --> 01:18:37.124
What, leave all this work, like the brothers?

01:18:37.209 --> 01:18:38.916
Yes.

01:18:40.625 --> 01:18:42.958
I told you it was no place to put a nunnery.

01:18:43.042 --> 01:18:47.666
There's something in the atmosphere
that makes everything seem exaggerated.

01:18:47.750 --> 01:18:51.833
Don't you understand? You must all get away
before something happens!

01:18:55.125 --> 01:18:57.208
(Rhythmic drums)

01:19:33.042 --> 01:19:35.124
(Wind howls)

01:19:54.334 --> 01:19:56.791
SISTER PHILIPPA: ..all snares near me.

01:19:56.875 --> 01:20:00.499
May thy hoIy angeIs dwell here
and keep us in peace...

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.083
(Sister Honey sobs)

01:20:16.375 --> 01:20:18.458
(Sister Briony snores)

01:20:33.084 --> 01:20:34.749
Sister, are you there?

01:20:45.042 --> 01:20:46.916
(Door rattles)

01:20:48.417 --> 01:20:51.416
Sister! Do you want me to wake the others?

01:20:58.209 --> 01:21:02.124
You can't order me about.
You have nothing to do with me any more.

01:21:02.209 --> 01:21:04.999
I know what you've done.
I know that you've left the Order.

01:21:05.084 --> 01:21:08.083
I only want to stop you
from doing something you'll be sorry for.

01:21:08.209 --> 01:21:11.999
Sister PhiIippa is going back in a few days' time.
I want to send you with her.

01:21:12.084 --> 01:21:14.124
That's what you would like to do.

01:21:14.209 --> 01:21:16.249
Send me back and shut me up!

01:21:16.334 --> 01:21:18.416
That's what you wouId all Iike to do!

01:21:42.125 --> 01:21:47.124
You know that isn't true. Why should we want
to keep you here against your will?

01:21:47.209 --> 01:21:49.249
Because you're all jealous of me.

01:21:49.334 --> 01:21:50.791
Especially you.

01:21:55.167 --> 01:21:57.249
At least wait till the morning.

01:21:59.417 --> 01:22:01.999
Wait till the morning and I'll wait with you.

01:24:03.917 --> 01:24:05.999
(Manic laughter)

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.374
- Ayah, wake up!
SISTER HONEY: What is it?

01:24:19.459 --> 01:24:21.499
- What's happened?
- It's Sister Ruth!

01:24:21.584 --> 01:24:23.458
Stop her! She's gone mad!

01:24:23.542 --> 01:24:25.583
Oh, it's my fault. It's all my fault!

01:24:25.667 --> 01:24:26.708
Sssh!

01:24:28.792 --> 01:24:31.249
Can't stop mad people.
You should leave them alone.

01:24:31.334 --> 01:24:34.374
- She may kill herself.
- If she's really mad, that won't matter.

01:24:34.459 --> 01:24:37.041
All of you, search the house! We must stop her!

01:24:37.125 --> 01:24:39.499
NUNS: Sister Ruth! Sister Ruth!

01:24:39.584 --> 01:24:41.458
We must get lanterns!

01:24:43.167 --> 01:24:44.708
Sister Ruth!

01:24:47.125 --> 01:24:49.791
(Mimics nuns) Sister Ruth! Sister Ruth!

01:24:49.875 --> 01:24:52.249
(Overlapping voices) Sister Ruth!

01:24:52.334 --> 01:24:54.916
SISTER BRIONY: Sister Ruth!
- Sister Ruth!

01:25:05.584 --> 01:25:08.458
SISTER CLODAGH:
Joseph! Ask him if he's seen her.

01:25:08.542 --> 01:25:10.958
Oh, no, Lemini, we couldn't do that.

01:25:11.042 --> 01:25:14.749
But, Joseph, anything may have happened
to the Lemini. She may be hurt.

01:25:14.834 --> 01:25:18.374
That would be a very little thing to him, Lemini.

01:25:18.459 --> 01:25:20.333
He wouldn't notice it.

01:25:20.834 --> 01:25:22.916
(Drums beat)

01:25:30.959 --> 01:25:32.499
(Growling)

01:25:34.584 --> 01:25:36.666
(Monkeys chatter)

01:25:38.667 --> 01:25:40.749
(Screeching)

01:25:44.709 --> 01:25:46.791
(Whistling, hissing)

01:26:22.459 --> 01:26:24.541
(Whistles)

01:26:54.209 --> 01:26:55.749
Good evening.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:03.541
Sister Ruth?

01:27:04.834 --> 01:27:06.874
I can't stand it any longer.

01:27:06.959 --> 01:27:09.208
I left the Order. I gave up my vows.

01:27:09.292 --> 01:27:11.166
I'm finished with them up there.

01:27:12.375 --> 01:27:13.833
I see.

01:27:14.875 --> 01:27:19.249
Well, I can arrange for you to stay
at the rest house. I'll send my boy over now.

01:27:19.334 --> 01:27:23.333
In the morning, I'll get ponies and porters
to take you to Darjeeling.

01:27:25.292 --> 01:27:26.791
I love you.

01:27:26.875 --> 01:27:27.916
You...

01:27:29.375 --> 01:27:31.749
Well, if you do, you can forget about it.

01:27:36.709 --> 01:27:39.166
I'm sorry, Sister Ruth, very sorry, but...

01:27:39.250 --> 01:27:42.624
Look, let me take you back to the palace.
lt isn't too late.

01:27:42.709 --> 01:27:45.749
Sister CIodagh is your friend.
She wants to heIp you.

01:27:45.875 --> 01:27:50.541
She hates me. They all hate me.
You're the only one that's ever been kind to me.

01:27:50.625 --> 01:27:52.958
- I? I've hardly spoken a word to you.
- You have.

01:27:53.042 --> 01:27:55.416
When I stopped the woman
from bleeding to death.

01:27:55.500 --> 01:27:57.291
- You said you were grateful.
- Did I?

01:27:57.375 --> 01:27:59.708
Then when you stopped me in the hall,
you said...

01:27:59.792 --> 01:28:01.833
Whatever I said, it didn't mean a thing.

01:28:01.917 --> 01:28:04.374
Ever since you came here,
you've all gone crazy.

01:28:04.459 --> 01:28:06.833
Drive one another crazy, but leave me out of it!

01:28:08.417 --> 01:28:10.458
Are you going to Darjeeling or not?

01:28:10.542 --> 01:28:12.916
- No!
- Then you must go back to the palace.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.791
- No.
- You'll go back if I have to carry you back.

01:28:16.834 --> 01:28:20.666
Go and talk to Sister Clodagh. She brought you
here, she can get you back again.

01:28:20.750 --> 01:28:22.374
Sister Clodagh, Sister Clodagh!

01:28:22.459 --> 01:28:25.374
- You know what she says about you?
- Whatever it is, it's true.

01:28:25.459 --> 01:28:28.416
- You say that because you love her!
- I don't love anyone!

01:28:28.500 --> 01:28:30.124
CIodagh.

01:28:30.209 --> 01:28:32.249
CIodagh, CIodagh.

01:28:32.334 --> 01:28:35.416
CIodagh! CIodagh! CIodagh!

01:28:35.500 --> 01:28:36.958
(Crash)

01:28:54.084 --> 01:28:56.166
Feel better now?

01:29:03.625 --> 01:29:05.166
All right.

01:29:06.209 --> 01:29:07.708
I'll go.

01:29:07.792 --> 01:29:09.541
That's a good girl.

01:29:09.625 --> 01:29:11.624
Try and get some sleep.

01:29:11.750 --> 01:29:16.083
In the morning, you'II wake up
and be sorry you made such a fool of yourself.

01:29:16.167 --> 01:29:18.208
Come on. I'll come with you.

01:29:18.292 --> 01:29:19.791
I'll go alone.

01:29:19.875 --> 01:29:21.916
You'll do nothing of the sort.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.374
I'll go alone or not at all.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:28.666
Suit yourself.

01:30:04.625 --> 01:30:05.624
(Gasps)

01:30:05.709 --> 01:30:07.791
It's morning, Lemini.

01:30:08.834 --> 01:30:11.166
Oh, yes, Joseph, it's morning.

01:30:11.250 --> 01:30:12.874
What time is it?

01:30:12.959 --> 01:30:15.374
5:45 by Auntie's watch.

01:30:19.750 --> 01:30:21.374
Fine day, Lemini.

01:30:21.459 --> 01:30:23.666
The people call it the...

01:30:23.750 --> 01:30:26.124
"the flying of the snows".

01:30:27.667 --> 01:30:31.124
Joseph, if Sister Briony asks for me,
I'll be in the chapel.

01:31:48.625 --> 01:31:50.708
(Door opens and shuts)

01:32:12.875 --> 01:32:14.958
(Silence)

01:33:06.625 --> 01:33:08.708
(Wind howls)

01:34:02.209 --> 01:34:04.291
(Bell rings out)

01:34:10.334 --> 01:34:12.374
(Weakly) Hail Mary, full of grace,

01:34:12.459 --> 01:34:15.041
blessed is the fruit of thy womb...

01:34:37.125 --> 01:34:38.874
(Screams)

01:34:49.750 --> 01:34:51.208
Argh!

01:34:57.792 --> 01:34:59.583
(Screams)

01:35:05.875 --> 01:35:07.541
(Drums beat)

01:35:10.542 --> 01:35:12.208
(Drums stop)

01:35:21.500 --> 01:35:23.583
(Chatter and shouting)

01:35:58.459 --> 01:36:00.541
What do you want, General?

01:36:10.750 --> 01:36:12.249
Sister,

01:36:12.334 --> 01:36:14.624
you know I have not been here, lately,

01:36:14.709 --> 01:36:17.124
and I'm deeply sorry about Sister Ruth.

01:36:17.209 --> 01:36:18.624
Thank you.

01:36:19.667 --> 01:36:21.291
Is there anything else?

01:36:21.375 --> 01:36:23.124
You're cross with me.

01:36:23.209 --> 01:36:25.249
Please do not be cross with me.

01:36:25.334 --> 01:36:28.916
I've done a very wrong thing,
but I didn't mean to do it.

01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:32.041
Isn't it rather late to tell me about that?

01:36:32.125 --> 01:36:33.541
Yes.

01:36:33.625 --> 01:36:35.458
Yes, it is, rather.

01:36:35.542 --> 01:36:38.124
I don't mean to do anything wrong again.

01:36:39.167 --> 01:36:41.916
I'm going to give up being clever and famous.

01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.541
I'm going to be exactly like my ancestors.

01:36:44.625 --> 01:36:46.666
They were warriors and princes.

01:36:46.750 --> 01:36:48.999
They were modest and brave and polite

01:36:49.084 --> 01:36:51.374
and they never did anything cheating.

01:36:52.625 --> 01:36:57.499
That is why I came to you as soon as I thought
of it, to teII you what I have done.

01:36:59.584 --> 01:37:01.416
Must you tell me now?

01:37:01.500 --> 01:37:04.291
- Please, Sister?
- Well, what have you done?

01:37:09.167 --> 01:37:12.249
Sister Clodagh, I didn't know how to tell you,

01:37:12.334 --> 01:37:14.374
so I asked Mr Dean.

01:37:14.459 --> 01:37:17.458
And he said to tell
it was the story of The Prince...

01:37:19.542 --> 01:37:21.416
..And The Beggar Maid.

01:38:07.709 --> 01:38:09.374
(Dismisses servant)

01:38:18.042 --> 01:38:20.499
You said you'd give us till the rains break.

01:38:20.584 --> 01:38:22.458
They haven't broken yet.

01:38:23.500 --> 01:38:25.624
What will they do with you down there?

01:38:25.709 --> 01:38:29.708
I shall be sent to another convent
with less responsibility.

01:38:29.792 --> 01:38:32.624
I shall be superseded as Sister-in-charge.

01:38:33.667 --> 01:38:35.708
Will you be able to stomach that?

01:38:35.792 --> 01:38:38.374
A stiff-necked, obstinate creature like you?

01:38:39.417 --> 01:38:41.041
It's what I need.

01:38:41.125 --> 01:38:44.999
I expect I shall have to remind myself of it
a hundred times a day.

01:38:45.084 --> 01:38:48.208
I can't change in a minute,
like the Young General.

01:38:50.375 --> 01:38:52.708
But I shall have my ghosts to remind me.

01:38:52.792 --> 01:38:55.083
You're leaving me with more than one.

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.083
Will you do one last thing for me?

01:39:02.125 --> 01:39:04.166
I know you'd rather not do it.

01:39:04.250 --> 01:39:05.874
Of course I'll do it.

01:39:05.959 --> 01:39:08.041
Will you look after the grave?

01:39:09.709 --> 01:39:11.749
All right.
