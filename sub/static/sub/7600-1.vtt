00:42.600 --> 00:46.639
And God said,
"Let there be light,"

00:46.640 --> 00:48.438
and there was light.

00:54.719 --> 00:59.758
Brothers and sisters,
Iet us send our prayers to heaven.

00:59.759 --> 01:02.559
Who will come forward and testify?

01:02.560 --> 01:07.930
Today, on this very day,
who wants to wash their sins?

01:45.680 --> 01:47.999
But you know, Willie,
if you work hard,

01:48.000 --> 01:51.878
pray hard, do your studies,
you can do really well.

01:51.879 --> 01:56.039
You know a priest
has the respect of everyone.

01:56.040 --> 01:58.279
You want to be a priest,
don't you, Willie?

01:58.280 --> 01:58.950
Yeah.

02:21.199 --> 02:24.209
For the eyes of God sees all!

02:43.360 --> 02:46.610
Hey, who are you styling up for?

02:47.800 --> 02:49.170
No-one, Mum.

02:59.800 --> 03:01.399
Dad's losing all his money again.

03:01.400 --> 03:03.878
And Mum won't be very happy
when he gets home.

03:03.879 --> 03:05.099
Check this.

03:05.120 --> 03:08.878
Gerry, you gambling old bugger!
You wait till I get hold of you!

03:08.879 --> 03:11.429
No-one's coming.

03:15.560 --> 03:16.780
Rosie, I...

03:17.120 --> 03:17.790
What?

03:18.240 --> 03:20.839
Well, because this is my last night,

03:20.840 --> 03:23.160
I thought that maybe...

03:23.680 --> 03:25.878
Well, I mean...just...

03:25.879 --> 03:27.318
Hello.

03:27.319 --> 03:28.478
Hello.
Hello.

03:28.479 --> 03:30.918
I just thought that...

03:30.919 --> 03:36.119
Just wondering if you'd like to come
with me to the pictures?

03:36.120 --> 03:38.040
What, like a date?

03:38.159 --> 03:41.959
Well...no, no, not a date. Like,
well, we could sit together, maybe.

03:41.960 --> 03:43.438
Willie, that's a date.

03:43.439 --> 03:45.439
Oh. Well, yeah. OK.

04:15.919 --> 04:16.509
Shh.

04:19.120 --> 04:20.878
You're a deadly singer,
you know that?

04:20.879 --> 04:24.758
You should come inside
and do a tune with the band.

04:24.759 --> 04:26.049
I'm Lester.

04:26.160 --> 04:26.910
Rosie.

04:27.759 --> 04:28.269
Hi.

04:28.839 --> 04:30.519
Er, I'm Willie.

04:37.279 --> 04:38.878
Come on, Rosie, we've got to go.

04:38.879 --> 04:40.278
Who is this? Your little brother?

04:40.279 --> 04:41.179
No. No.

04:41.800 --> 04:43.119
Ah, is he your boyfriend?

04:43.120 --> 04:43.630
No.

04:44.920 --> 04:47.599
Well, alright, then. I'll just be in there.

04:47.600 --> 04:49.280
If you want me.

04:51.839 --> 04:53.518
Why did you say we have to go?

04:53.519 --> 04:55.239
Because we're not allowed in there.
Why not?

04:55.240 --> 04:56.359
You know why not.

04:56.360 --> 04:57.820
Alright, boys!

05:00.920 --> 05:03.039
Come on. This is my big chance.

05:07.360 --> 05:11.838
Well, I guess I'll see you
Iater then. At the pictures?

06:53.439 --> 06:54.269
Willie!

06:57.439 --> 07:01.079
Go on, Willie.
You run to your mum.

07:05.279 --> 07:06.999
About time. Where you been?

07:07.000 --> 07:07.910
Fishing.

07:12.759 --> 07:16.078
Lord, we thank you
for all the gifts you give us.

07:16.079 --> 07:20.278
Special prayers goes out to that
sinner cousin of mine, Johnny.

07:20.279 --> 07:23.999
Please, Lord, help him
to stop drinking his life away

07:24.000 --> 07:25.479
at that Roebuck Hotel.

07:25.480 --> 07:30.479
May the Lord Jesus Christ
burn that house of sin down!

07:30.480 --> 07:31.780
Sorry, Lord.

07:32.560 --> 07:36.398
And please keep my son safe
while he is away in the city

07:36.399 --> 07:40.398
and please help him, Lord,
not to be late

07:40.399 --> 07:43.259
as it drives his mother mad.

07:45.120 --> 07:45.790
Amen.

07:46.199 --> 07:46.869
Amen.

08:16.600 --> 08:17.110
Hi.

08:24.639 --> 08:27.078
Hey, Rosie, where's Willie?

08:27.079 --> 08:28.559
I don't know.

08:28.560 --> 08:30.599
He wanna sit with you.

08:30.600 --> 08:31.878
Where is Willie?

08:31.879 --> 08:34.839
I don't know. He's gone fishing.

08:36.799 --> 08:38.489
Hey, Lester boy!

11:05.320 --> 11:08.678
Ah, Willie.
Welcome back to the city.

11:08.679 --> 11:10.558
Thank you, Father Benedictus.

11:10.559 --> 11:11.839
Come in, fellow.

11:16.799 --> 11:19.119
How were your holidays?
Did you catch any fish?

11:19.120 --> 11:20.678
Ah, one or two.

11:20.679 --> 11:22.599
Perhaps you're not
praying hard enough.

11:25.679 --> 11:26.758
Now, Willie...

11:26.759 --> 11:27.798
Yes, Father?

11:27.799 --> 11:30.359
I have been inspecting
my inventory of supplies.

11:30.360 --> 11:32.798
You weren't one of those boys
drinking the altar wine last year,

11:32.799 --> 11:33.798
were you, Willie?

11:33.799 --> 11:34.798
No, Father.

11:34.799 --> 11:36.019
Good. Good.

11:36.480 --> 11:39.359
Because this year you are a prefect.

11:39.360 --> 11:42.278
And as head student
you must set an example.

11:42.279 --> 11:43.579
Yes, Father.

11:43.919 --> 11:46.999
Mmm. I have great faith
in you, Willie.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.300
Yes, Father.

11:57.159 --> 11:58.638
How is your lovely mutter?

11:58.639 --> 11:59.878
Good, Father.

11:59.879 --> 12:01.599
She has high hopes in you.

12:01.600 --> 12:04.319
You can become a very
successful individual, Willie.

12:04.320 --> 12:06.758
You too can become close to God.

12:06.759 --> 12:08.239
I can see it!

12:08.240 --> 12:13.700
Willie, you can go forth
and help your Aborigine people.

12:13.759 --> 12:16.038
They are crying in the wilderness.

12:16.039 --> 12:18.798
You have so much to give the world.

12:18.799 --> 12:22.398
So, my little friend, if you
knuckle down to some serious study

12:22.399 --> 12:25.678
and pray hard -
not for me but for you -

12:25.679 --> 12:28.069
you can become like me!

12:29.120 --> 12:31.360
Oh, ja! Ja!

12:32.039 --> 12:32.549
Ja.

13:02.240 --> 13:03.540
Hey, Willie!

13:03.679 --> 13:04.959
Where'd Willie go?

13:04.960 --> 13:06.100
Whoo-whoo!

13:11.360 --> 13:12.110
Rosie.

13:12.600 --> 13:13.900
Here, catch!

13:14.080 --> 13:16.158
Well,
I've got something for you too.

13:16.159 --> 13:17.398
What, like a present...?

13:28.759 --> 13:30.798
Honour thy father
and thy mother

13:30.799 --> 13:33.239
that thy days may be long

13:33.240 --> 13:35.719
upon the lands
which the Lord giveth thee.

13:35.720 --> 13:37.558
Thou shall not kill.

13:37.559 --> 13:40.119
Thou shall not...adultery.

13:40.279 --> 13:41.638
Thou shall not steal.

13:41.639 --> 13:45.558
Thou shall not bear false witness
against thy name

13:45.559 --> 13:48.518
or covet thy neighbour's wife
or his...

13:53.080 --> 13:54.380
Start again.

14:03.639 --> 14:06.959
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

14:06.960 --> 14:10.479
It has been two months
since my last confession.

14:10.480 --> 14:12.999
What do you wish to confess, my son?

14:13.000 --> 14:17.040
I have had thoughts
about a girl...um...

14:18.600 --> 14:22.590
Thoughts? What thoughts?
Lustful thoughts?

14:23.360 --> 14:24.660
Yes, Father.

14:24.840 --> 14:31.230
You are a good boy. You will
overcome these sinful urges in time.

14:31.559 --> 14:33.878
It is part of the hard road
to becoming a priest

14:33.879 --> 14:36.189
that we all must face.

14:36.840 --> 14:38.300
But, Father...

14:39.320 --> 14:44.199
..I don't know if I'd be good
at being a priest.

14:44.200 --> 14:45.719
You want to waste your life

14:45.720 --> 14:47.758
like all those useless blackfellas
up in Broome?

14:47.759 --> 14:51.879
No, Willie, you're
much better than that.

14:51.960 --> 14:54.158
Your penance is 15 rosaries.

14:54.159 --> 14:55.059
Now go.

16:44.519 --> 16:45.999
- Willie!
- Rosie?

16:46.000 --> 16:47.918
Rosie? It's Peter. Come on.

16:47.919 --> 16:49.759
Go back to sleep.

16:50.120 --> 16:52.638
Come on. We've got some hunting
to do tonight, boy.

16:52.639 --> 16:54.239
What are you talking about?

16:54.240 --> 16:55.878
The tuck shop. Shh, come on.

16:55.879 --> 16:57.359
You're gonna get in trouble.

16:57.360 --> 16:58.479
Come on, Willie.

16:58.480 --> 17:01.558
- Hey. Hey, wake up.
- But I'm tired.

17:01.559 --> 17:03.119
Shh. Shhh. Come on, let's go.

17:03.120 --> 17:05.819
Come on, Willie. Let's go.

17:08.440 --> 17:10.599
Come on, Willie.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.480
Wait.

17:19.640 --> 17:21.999
Let's go, let's go.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.479
Hurry up.

17:33.920 --> 17:35.679
Come on, come on, come on.

17:35.680 --> 17:37.440
Keep an eye out.

17:42.680 --> 17:44.719
"Thou shalt not steal"!

17:44.720 --> 17:46.479
Thou shalt not starve either.

17:46.480 --> 17:48.358
We should go back.

17:48.359 --> 17:50.439
Food for our souls.
Now, what you want?

17:50.440 --> 17:51.959
What are you doing?

17:51.960 --> 17:56.660
Itemising every available
confection und beverage.

17:56.720 --> 17:59.159
Oh, yum. Thank you, Lord.

17:59.160 --> 18:00.439
Thank you, Lord.

18:00.440 --> 18:02.719
And this is for
all the starving kids in the world.

18:02.720 --> 18:04.518
Like us, bro. Us black kids are starving.

18:04.519 --> 18:06.279
Ja, ja, ja!

18:18.960 --> 18:20.679
Benny, Benny.

18:23.519 --> 18:26.079
Benny's coming!

18:32.079 --> 18:34.219
Let's go. Let's go.

18:34.279 --> 18:38.999
My greatest desire is
to see you Aborigine people educated

18:39.000 --> 18:41.758
and trained in the skills
of the modern world,

18:41.759 --> 18:47.078
to become citizens of this great
country that is truly yours.

18:47.079 --> 18:51.039
We have to show love
to these children.

18:51.240 --> 18:55.210
Lux in tenebris -
light in the darkness!

18:56.039 --> 19:00.159
Yet, we all know there are
many evils in the world today.

19:00.160 --> 19:05.220
For now, let us just talk
about theft and pillage -

19:05.559 --> 19:07.479
sins of the flesh.

19:09.519 --> 19:12.849
Tommy, will you not come up here?

19:21.039 --> 19:23.798
I have been itemising supplies
from the canteen.

19:23.799 --> 19:26.838
And to my surprise,
we are a little short.

19:27.839 --> 19:29.118
Thou shalt not steal!

19:29.119 --> 19:30.758
We're gonna get whacked.

19:30.759 --> 19:36.919
Unless there is a confession,
I will be forced to punish Tommy.

19:57.240 --> 20:00.159
Willie, I am very disappointed in you.

20:00.160 --> 20:05.050
You are a prefect
and yet you throw it all away.

20:05.279 --> 20:07.558
I had such great faith in you.

20:07.559 --> 20:10.959
You are a rotten apple
in the barrel.

20:10.960 --> 20:14.239
You are a stain
on the celebration of life.

20:14.240 --> 20:20.310
You are an abomination in the eyes
of God! Put out your hand!

20:20.720 --> 20:23.318
I should have known
one of your Aborigine kind

20:23.319 --> 20:25.639
would be worth nothing!

20:27.519 --> 20:29.118
That's not true, Father.

20:29.119 --> 20:29.869
What?!

22:10.960 --> 22:12.730
Run, Willie, run!

22:37.680 --> 22:39.830
I will find the boy.

23:54.519 --> 23:57.929
Hey, boy, where you bin come from?

23:58.160 --> 24:00.358
This fire looks lovely and warm.

24:00.359 --> 24:02.879
It's gonna be
a cold one tonight.

24:02.880 --> 24:05.999
Come here. We're not gonna eat you.
Well, not yet, anyway.

24:07.039 --> 24:08.558
Come here. Come here. Sit down.

24:08.559 --> 24:11.509
Relax. Come here, young fella.

24:16.440 --> 24:17.919
I got nowhere to stay.

24:17.920 --> 24:19.919
Any of you mob got anywhere to stay?

24:19.920 --> 24:21.380
Nope.

24:21.880 --> 24:24.278
You in good company here, boy.

24:24.279 --> 24:25.959
I wanna go home.

24:25.960 --> 24:28.278
Well, we all wanna go home, eh?

24:28.279 --> 24:31.439
But we're a long, long way away
from our country.

25:17.359 --> 25:19.049
Yeah, yeah!

25:19.319 --> 25:19.909
Hey!

25:23.319 --> 25:25.479
Where your home, boy?

25:25.519 --> 25:26.349
Broome.

25:26.759 --> 25:29.299
Hmm. That's my home too.

25:29.720 --> 25:30.390
True?

25:31.559 --> 25:32.229
True.

25:33.160 --> 25:35.399
Here, I'll tell you a story.

25:35.400 --> 25:37.080
Oh, here we go.

25:37.400 --> 25:38.959
I been away 15 years now.

25:38.960 --> 25:39.959
15 years?

25:39.960 --> 25:42.038
Shut up, boy. Let me tell you
the story. Right?

25:42.039 --> 25:44.639
I been drinking, I been droving,

25:44.640 --> 25:46.879
I've been a Christian,
I've been everything.

25:46.880 --> 25:52.038
But now I reckon it's time
that I went home before I die.

25:52.039 --> 25:54.999
Yep, I'd better go back home to Broome.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.530
Yep, yep, yep.

25:58.799 --> 26:01.118
But you still never tell me
your name.

26:01.119 --> 26:03.829
My name is William Johnson.

26:04.319 --> 26:06.318
My name is Steven Johnson.

26:08.119 --> 26:09.799
I'm your uncle.

26:09.839 --> 26:14.349
I reckon your mummy
must be my sister brother

26:15.519 --> 26:18.719
and I bin call him sister
but she bin call you uncle.

26:18.720 --> 26:22.239
So that's how come
I'm your sist...sist...sist...

26:22.240 --> 26:24.518
Yeah, I'm your uncle, OK?!

26:27.000 --> 26:28.460
Uncle Tadpole.

26:28.480 --> 26:29.940
Uncle Tadpole.

26:30.759 --> 26:33.229
Hey, you got any tucker?

26:35.240 --> 26:38.318
Now, what they bin doing to you,
boy? They bin hit you?

26:38.319 --> 26:41.239
No. I've been running
from boarding school.

26:41.240 --> 26:43.598
How come?
What you been doing wrong?

26:43.599 --> 26:45.598
I don't wanna talk about it.

26:45.599 --> 26:47.199
They been starving you, hey?

26:47.200 --> 26:48.639
Yeah, that's the trouble.

26:48.640 --> 26:52.758
You never get enough tucker,
you never get enough beer

26:52.759 --> 26:55.038
and you never get
enough womans, eh?

26:55.039 --> 26:56.598
No, Uncle...no.

26:56.599 --> 26:58.078
I know you young fellas!

26:58.079 --> 26:59.879
You been rootin' round here,
rootin' round there,

26:59.880 --> 27:01.358
rootin' round everywhere!

27:01.359 --> 27:03.358
No, Uncle, I feel sorry now.

27:03.359 --> 27:04.838
I gotta go see my mum,

27:04.839 --> 27:07.078
but when she find out
I'm running from school,

27:07.079 --> 27:08.798
she gonna be real wild.

27:08.799 --> 27:11.239
Well, I bin fix
your mummy up for you.

27:11.240 --> 27:13.479
I know how to fix up womans.

27:16.519 --> 27:20.118
I'm gonna take this boy
home to Broome,

27:20.119 --> 27:24.159
home to his dear mother,
away from this place.

27:24.160 --> 27:26.630
Yeah, yeah, good on you.

27:30.119 --> 27:31.639
OK, let's go.

27:54.440 --> 27:57.679
Wake up, Uncle.
Time to go. Wake up.

27:57.680 --> 27:59.050
Who are you?

28:00.440 --> 28:02.610
Your nephew. Remember?

28:03.039 --> 28:04.099
Nah. Nah.

28:05.759 --> 28:07.399
You said we're going to Broome.

28:07.400 --> 28:08.999
Why would I wanna go to Broome?

28:09.000 --> 28:12.480
But you promised me you'd take me.

28:19.359 --> 28:23.758
Um, we can't go anywhere
without any...any cash.

28:23.759 --> 28:26.379
You got any money on you?

28:27.359 --> 28:33.749
Well, come on, boy. You can't go
nowhere without money, you know?

28:38.839 --> 28:40.839
Where are we going?

28:41.319 --> 28:43.319
Where do you think?

28:45.680 --> 28:46.660
In here.

28:55.400 --> 28:56.850
And a bottle?

29:07.519 --> 29:09.358
What did you do with my money?

29:09.359 --> 29:11.639
You bought grog with it, eh?!

29:11.640 --> 29:13.950
Give me back my money.

29:14.759 --> 29:17.078
That's my money, not yours. Mine!

29:17.079 --> 29:19.318
You're not going to take me
to Broome, are you?

29:19.319 --> 29:22.489
You're just an old drunken bum!

29:23.599 --> 29:26.919
I'll find my own way back to Broome.
I don't want anything to do with you!

30:01.200 --> 30:02.810
You ready, kid?

30:06.119 --> 30:07.118
Look out!

30:11.240 --> 30:14.719
Oh...my...God.
We've run over an Aborigine!

30:24.079 --> 30:28.179
Oh, my God. What have we done?
It's OK.

30:28.720 --> 30:30.399
Old man, are you alright?

30:30.400 --> 30:32.159
Don't touch him. Don't touch him.

30:32.160 --> 30:33.450
Are you OK?

30:37.799 --> 30:39.278
I don't speak Aborigine!

30:39.279 --> 30:40.499
Me neither.

30:40.640 --> 30:44.770
We...will...take...you...
to the hospital.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.199
I don't want to go no hospital.

30:49.200 --> 30:50.758
Where do you wanna go then?

30:50.759 --> 30:53.219
I want to go to Broome!

31:00.359 --> 31:01.399
Annie?

31:01.400 --> 31:02.860
Yes, Slippery.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.358
Where's Broome?

31:05.960 --> 31:09.758
It's not far up here.
It won't take long.

31:10.799 --> 31:13.679
And so you come
from Broome, do you?

31:13.680 --> 31:15.920
I was born...

31:17.599 --> 31:20.779
..in the midst of the Dreamtime.

31:21.119 --> 31:24.609
My mother is from the crocodile mob

31:25.480 --> 31:29.680
and my...my father...
is...um, koala bear.

31:31.960 --> 31:33.639
And, um, where are you from?

31:33.640 --> 31:36.239
Me. Er, I am from Germany.

31:36.240 --> 31:39.679
I have come to
the land of your people

31:39.680 --> 31:41.719
to make a visit with my father.

31:41.720 --> 31:44.318
And also I am on a vision quest.

31:44.319 --> 31:46.639
Yeah, we follow Buddha.

31:48.839 --> 31:53.669
That's proper...proper rude word
in our language!

31:54.160 --> 31:57.598
You don't look so bad now.
Maybe you are better.

31:57.599 --> 32:02.189
Well, what you talking about?
Just look at me!

32:03.680 --> 32:05.798
I think we might drop you off
somewhere, old man.

32:05.799 --> 32:07.329
Oh, no.

32:08.039 --> 32:10.078
You hear that, Willie?

32:10.079 --> 32:14.078
They just gonna dump us
by the side of the road.

32:14.079 --> 32:14.589
No!

32:15.240 --> 32:17.919
Do you know it's bad karma to knock
over an Aborigine with a Kombi van?

32:17.920 --> 32:21.278
Yeah, you could get the bone
pointed at you.

32:21.279 --> 32:23.038
Proper bad thing that.

32:23.039 --> 32:24.399
The bone?
Yeah.

32:24.400 --> 32:28.959
And when you have children,
they will look like...like...

32:28.960 --> 32:29.870
Wombats.

32:30.160 --> 32:31.838
Hairy nosed wombats.

32:31.839 --> 32:33.598
Slippery,
I think this was meant to be.

32:33.599 --> 32:35.719
We were meant to help these people.

32:35.720 --> 32:38.879
And they will show us
their country first-hand.

32:38.880 --> 32:41.798
What better experience
than to do that with you

32:41.799 --> 32:43.479
and these two black people.

32:43.480 --> 32:47.850
I mean, native people -
A...Aborigine people.

32:48.640 --> 32:50.919
People that understand you and me.

32:50.920 --> 32:51.590
Yeah.

32:52.599 --> 32:54.879
Annie, we don't even know
these people

32:54.880 --> 32:57.199
and we are meant to visit my father.

32:57.200 --> 32:59.798
Anyway, how far exactly is Broome?

32:59.799 --> 33:01.249
Not far!

33:01.319 --> 33:03.278
Slippery, if you want to be a hippie,

33:03.279 --> 33:05.439
you gotta stop
acting so bloody square!

33:05.440 --> 33:06.879
Yeah, square.
OK.

33:06.880 --> 33:08.879
These maps with their lines
and their numbers,

33:08.880 --> 33:10.518
they just fence us in, man.

33:10.519 --> 33:12.399
They cramp our inner selves.

33:12.400 --> 33:16.518
We don't need maps, Slippery,
we have an Aboriginal elder!

33:16.519 --> 33:18.989
Who?
Not...not the map!

33:22.079 --> 33:25.559
OK, so we drop them off in Broome.

33:25.880 --> 33:27.919
It's just up the road.

33:34.480 --> 33:37.639
16 years old.
School uniform. You seen him?

33:37.640 --> 33:39.038
Willie, you say?

33:40.039 --> 33:42.159
No, he ain't been around here.

33:42.160 --> 33:44.080
You seen a Willie?

33:45.599 --> 33:47.078
Oh, that is a shame

33:47.079 --> 33:51.679
because I need to return this boy
to his poor mother.

33:51.680 --> 33:53.130
Such a shame.

33:53.279 --> 33:54.979
Actually...
Hmm?

33:55.240 --> 33:58.030
..there was one young fella.

33:59.480 --> 34:03.078
He said he was taking off to Broome.

34:03.079 --> 34:03.909
Broome?

34:04.200 --> 34:05.340
Thank you.

35:43.360 --> 35:45.238
Hey, sing along, sing along!

35:45.239 --> 35:46.219
Shut up.

35:49.679 --> 35:52.319
He can't sing, that fella.

36:23.440 --> 36:24.260
G'day.

36:24.920 --> 36:26.300
Coke, please.

36:26.400 --> 36:29.270
Nothing else take your fancy?

36:30.360 --> 36:32.910
We got hot sausage rolls,

36:33.199 --> 36:35.238
hot roast beef rolls.

36:35.239 --> 36:37.319
And hot Chiko rolls.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.460
Whoo, it's hot in here!

36:42.679 --> 36:46.319
Can I have a hot Chiko roll, please?

36:47.920 --> 36:51.260
Um, well, a chicken sandwich then.

36:56.559 --> 36:58.999
Uncle! Uncle, what are you doing?

36:59.000 --> 37:00.638
Uncle, don't touch anything.

37:02.639 --> 37:04.078
What are you doing?

37:04.079 --> 37:06.078
Here, put it in your boonyah. Go on!

37:06.079 --> 37:08.939
It's cold. Stop. Stop. Oooh!

37:09.599 --> 37:12.149
I'll have that.

37:15.159 --> 37:17.678
Oh, OK, money.
Here we go.

37:17.679 --> 37:19.989
What's wrong with him?

37:20.079 --> 37:20.989
Nothing.

37:25.320 --> 37:28.319
Run! Come on.
Quick! Crank it up.

37:28.320 --> 37:31.040
Drive! Drive, hippie, drive!

37:31.320 --> 37:33.000
Go, go, go, go!

37:33.559 --> 37:36.969
In there, quick! Come on! Come on!

37:37.119 --> 37:39.119
Annie! Wait for me!

37:40.280 --> 37:41.650
Wait for me!

37:42.559 --> 37:44.399
Jump! Jump! Jump!

37:52.559 --> 37:54.439
You should have seen you...

37:54.440 --> 37:56.999
See what you've done?
Look what this is.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.238
Hey, look what I got, eh?

37:59.239 --> 38:00.919
Who likes Rolf Harris?

38:00.920 --> 38:04.880
I hate Rolf Harris!
Who is Rolf Harris?

38:22.239 --> 38:22.749
Om.

38:28.599 --> 38:29.979
Om.

38:32.719 --> 38:34.198
You want a sausage?

38:34.199 --> 38:36.509
But stealing is a sin.

38:37.559 --> 38:42.689
Well, you can either be a sinner
or you can starve.

38:42.840 --> 38:45.070
He is right, old man.

38:45.199 --> 38:47.399
Stealing is very, very wrong.

38:47.400 --> 38:49.090
Shut up, Buddha.

38:49.800 --> 38:52.799
Your stealing nearly get us killed!

38:52.800 --> 38:54.100
Me - killed!

38:54.960 --> 38:56.638
My girlfriend - killed!

38:56.639 --> 38:58.399
He just wants to feed us.

38:58.400 --> 38:59.678
Got plenty of tucker here.

38:59.679 --> 39:02.389
We must respect their ways.

39:03.440 --> 39:04.959
I wish I had never met you.

39:06.159 --> 39:07.459
These flies!

39:09.039 --> 39:10.579
Flies...

39:13.360 --> 39:14.900
Slippery. Wait.

39:15.039 --> 39:17.449
Slippery. Slippery, wait.

39:23.239 --> 39:26.879
So, would you like to come out back
in the kitchen

39:26.880 --> 39:29.180
for a hot cup of tea?

39:31.159 --> 39:35.349
No. Actually,
I'm in a big hurry. Thanks.

39:45.000 --> 39:46.760
You got a woman?

39:49.360 --> 39:51.279
Well, I got this girl, Rosie...

39:51.280 --> 39:52.030
Rosie.

39:52.840 --> 39:55.390
Yeah, she back in Broome.

39:56.039 --> 39:58.669
She different one from me.

40:00.119 --> 40:04.849
But, like, I don't know
if she like me, Uncle.

40:05.440 --> 40:09.399
"But...I don't know
if she like me, Uncle."

40:09.400 --> 40:11.279
When you find them,
you gotta grab them.

40:11.280 --> 40:12.279
Grab them?

40:12.280 --> 40:13.970
Yeah, grab them.

40:15.719 --> 40:17.489
Look, look, look.

40:17.760 --> 40:20.070
See, when God made man

40:21.280 --> 40:23.280
and God made woman,

40:24.239 --> 40:26.759
he made them different, see?

40:26.760 --> 40:31.158
And when they bin
find each other, they do this.

40:31.159 --> 40:32.459
You never...

40:36.199 --> 40:39.449
Well, I won't tell anyone, then.

40:40.079 --> 40:41.678
Thank you, Uncle.

40:41.679 --> 40:44.319
Willie, a virgin.

40:48.639 --> 40:51.349
Willie's a virgin.

41:59.239 --> 42:01.718
I can't take it anymore, Annie.

42:01.719 --> 42:03.549
It's me or them.

42:57.280 --> 43:00.690
Have you got another one of these?

43:00.960 --> 43:02.500
Useless hippie.

43:12.760 --> 43:14.380
Hello.

43:21.280 --> 43:22.759
What kind of people

43:22.760 --> 43:28.920
would leave folks lying out here
in the middle of nowhere, hmm?

43:35.840 --> 43:38.558
The beginning
of a new life cycle.

43:38.559 --> 43:41.209
Energy, happiness, optimism.

43:41.599 --> 43:44.558
The overturning of the status quo
or current states

43:44.559 --> 43:46.969
by unexpected happenings.

43:47.199 --> 43:49.038
Important decisions to be made.

43:50.119 --> 43:53.319
The seven of wands reversed.
Indecision and retreat.

43:53.320 --> 43:55.359
A lack of decisiveness

43:55.360 --> 43:58.919
which causes the challenge
to be lost through hesitation.

43:58.920 --> 44:02.950
Giving in just as the end
was in sight.

44:08.159 --> 44:10.789
What are you doing?

44:14.440 --> 44:16.279
Where are you going?
I'm going to Broome.

44:16.280 --> 44:19.850
Jump in.
We're gonna play football.

44:20.639 --> 44:21.939
Hello, boys.

44:32.760 --> 44:34.600
Willie. Don't go.

45:00.559 --> 45:01.939
Ah! Scheisse!

45:12.039 --> 45:15.598
Mate, this is gonna hurt me
more than it's gonna hurt you.

46:06.920 --> 46:09.320
Welcome to Port Hedland.

46:09.559 --> 46:12.429
Proper deadly place this one.

46:16.039 --> 46:18.718
Hey, Coach!
What happened to Broome?

46:18.719 --> 46:21.558
Broome?
Yeah, when we beat Port Hedland.

46:21.559 --> 46:23.799
Then we'll take you Broome
next week.

46:23.800 --> 46:27.450
Come on.
Come and have some Chinese.

46:31.679 --> 46:32.659
Come on.

48:04.320 --> 48:05.930
Hey, excuse me.

48:07.320 --> 48:08.460
Yeah, you.

48:09.719 --> 48:11.559
What's your name?

48:12.639 --> 48:14.879
I'm Roxanne.

48:15.239 --> 48:16.529
I'm Willie.

48:16.760 --> 48:18.598
Where you come from, Willie?

48:18.599 --> 48:21.769
Broome. But I've been in Perth.

48:22.159 --> 48:26.638
Perth, eh? Oh, I bin go Perth
Iong time ago, you know?

48:26.639 --> 48:29.319
Hey, proper cold, that place,
cold weather time, eh?

48:29.320 --> 48:31.598
Eh, not like this place.

48:31.599 --> 48:35.009
Hot all year round. Like us women!

48:36.880 --> 48:40.078
What you doing here all on your own?

48:40.079 --> 48:42.559
Er, just passing through.

48:46.760 --> 48:48.638
You wanna come drink with us?

48:48.639 --> 48:50.709
Umm...I don't know.

48:52.360 --> 48:54.638
Don't you drink? Are you underage?

48:54.639 --> 48:56.009
No, I drink.

48:57.519 --> 49:00.459
Yeah, you look like real man.

49:04.559 --> 49:06.399
Come on. Come on.

49:07.199 --> 49:08.649
Come with me.

49:11.679 --> 49:14.609
I'll show you a condom tree.

49:27.760 --> 49:29.930
Yeah.

49:39.480 --> 49:41.718
You look like...an angel.

49:41.719 --> 49:43.179
Yeah?

49:44.880 --> 49:45.550
Yeah.

50:15.199 --> 50:16.959
I didn't know she was your woman!

50:16.960 --> 50:19.399
What's that, eh?!
It's...from the condom tree.

50:19.400 --> 50:20.300
Get up!

50:39.639 --> 50:41.009
Who are you?

50:41.119 --> 50:42.598
Young fella, young fella,

50:44.800 --> 50:48.440

Come on, come on.
I'm ready for you.

50:55.559 --> 50:57.078
Come on. Come on!

50:57.079 --> 51:00.399
Hey, Willie, I just

51:00.400 --> 51:02.359
What? How did you find me?

51:02.360 --> 51:04.799
All young fellas end up here
at the condom tree.

51:04.800 --> 51:07.518
Hey, Willie, we're going
to Broome, we're going to Broome.

51:07.519 --> 51:09.439
Even Slippery want to go to Broome.

51:09.440 --> 51:12.158
Ja. We go to Broome.
It's just up the road, yeah?

51:12.159 --> 51:12.829
Yeah.

51:14.639 --> 51:17.329
Oh. That's OK. That's OK.

51:31.320 --> 51:34.420
Ah, Broome, ich komme. Ahh, ja.

It's good, ja?

51:49.519 --> 51:50.429
Roxanne?

51:52.000 --> 51:54.799
How hard is it for a woman
to get some sleep back here?

51:54.800 --> 51:56.238
How did you get in my van?

51:56.239 --> 51:57.539
Black magic.

51:57.679 --> 52:02.879
Hey! Tell ya, that old town gonna
light up when Roxanne get to Broome!

52:18.719 --> 52:20.559
What is a boomer?

52:20.920 --> 52:22.879
It's a bloody big kangaroo.

52:24.599 --> 52:26.989
And who is Rolf Harris?

52:27.760 --> 52:29.238
Is he an Aborigine like you?

52:29.239 --> 52:31.238
Yeah. He's my cousin's brother.

52:32.239 --> 52:35.889
Hey.
What am I? Hmm?

52:35.920 --> 52:37.399
I don't know.

52:37.400 --> 52:38.840
I'm a koala.

52:40.840 --> 52:42.799
We are in the Dreamtime!

52:42.800 --> 52:45.820
Hey, watch out for those roos!

52:46.639 --> 52:50.199
Don't touch the wheel. Don't touch.

52:51.800 --> 52:54.980
Um...um, cops. Um...um...police.

52:55.559 --> 52:56.839
Police, you stupid hippie!

52:56.840 --> 52:58.678
Quick, chuck me the stuff!
Shut up, you.

52:58.679 --> 53:00.678
I will do the talking.
Now look what you've done!

53:00.679 --> 53:02.319
Shut up, you two! Shut up!

53:02.320 --> 53:03.399
Pull over.

53:03.400 --> 53:05.078
Why do they persecute us?

53:05.079 --> 53:07.319
We're free. We're just trying
to have a good time!

53:07.320 --> 53:08.300
Shut up.

53:08.360 --> 53:10.799
We're free, we're free
and we'll always be free!

53:10.800 --> 53:12.319
Shut up!

53:12.320 --> 53:13.620
What?

53:19.599 --> 53:21.558
I don't even know these people.

53:21.559 --> 53:25.399
I only met them yesterday.
That is right, ja?

53:25.400 --> 53:26.070
Yeah.

53:26.440 --> 53:28.319
I was on my way to visit my father

53:28.320 --> 53:30.678
when that man
jumped in front of my van.

53:34.480 --> 53:36.320
What's your name?

53:36.320 --> 53:38.260
Wolfgang Benedictus.

53:38.519 --> 53:41.399
And how do you spell that, Adolph?

53:41.400 --> 53:43.900
B-E-N-E-D-I-C-T-U-S.

53:45.360 --> 53:47.999
You cannot hold me here.
My father is a priest.

53:48.000 --> 53:50.540
He will come and get me.

53:52.639 --> 53:53.779
Thank you.

54:01.880 --> 54:05.118
Yes, hello, um, I wish to speak
to Father Benedictus.

54:05.119 --> 54:07.198
I'm sorry,
that's not possible. He's gone.

54:07.199 --> 54:08.419
Gone?
Yes.

54:08.480 --> 54:09.518
Gone where?

54:09.519 --> 54:12.759
He's travelling to Broome
on school business.

54:12.760 --> 54:13.900
Thank you.

54:23.719 --> 54:26.569
He is on his way to Broome.

54:28.559 --> 54:30.158
Get off him. Get off him.

54:30.159 --> 54:32.598
Annie, Annie. Stop it!
What are you doing?

54:32.599 --> 54:34.599
Don't get involved.

54:34.960 --> 54:37.158
Annie! Stop it! Annie! Annie!

54:37.159 --> 54:38.959
Get off him!

54:38.960 --> 54:43.518
Get off him, Annie!
What are you doing? Stop it!

54:43.519 --> 54:45.359
Get off him! Hey!

54:46.280 --> 54:48.999
Get off me! Annie!

54:49.000 --> 54:49.750
Annie!

54:51.000 --> 54:53.540
This is not fair at all!

54:54.519 --> 54:56.129
Just get... Oh!

54:56.280 --> 54:58.038
Just come in. Just... Willie.

54:59.960 --> 55:01.330
Oh! Get off!

55:04.440 --> 55:05.799
Stop struggling, Annie.

55:05.800 --> 55:06.790
Willie...

55:09.400 --> 55:10.230
Willie!

55:10.719 --> 55:13.909
This is physical harassment, man.

55:17.199 --> 55:18.718
Not cool at all.

55:18.719 --> 55:20.479
Not cool at all!

55:20.880 --> 55:24.300
Uncle, blackfellas die in jail, eh?

55:26.880 --> 55:30.680
Come on.
You get some sleep. Come on.

57:57.559 --> 58:03.169
Come on, Willie.
Wake up. Wake up, boy. Wake up.

58:09.880 --> 58:12.500
Last night I had a dream.

58:15.159 --> 58:18.969
There were bush people here,
with you.

58:19.440 --> 58:22.450
But it wasn't here, it was...

58:26.239 --> 58:28.639
..it was somewhere else.

58:30.000 --> 58:34.280
Those are the old people,
Iooking after us.

58:38.719 --> 58:40.489
You alright? Hey?

58:42.519 --> 58:44.059
Nothing broken?

58:44.360 --> 58:46.350
No. It's not that.

58:47.880 --> 58:49.999
Slippery's father
is Father Benedictus.

58:50.000 --> 58:53.439
He's going to go tell Mum about me,
that I'm a sinner and a thief

58:53.440 --> 58:56.479
and, well, now I won't be able
to go back to Broome.

58:56.480 --> 58:58.598
And I won't be able
to go back to Clontarf.

58:58.599 --> 59:00.479
I'll have nowhere to go.

59:00.480 --> 59:02.780
I'll end up like you!

59:08.960 --> 59:10.959
Your mummy will forgive you.

59:10.960 --> 59:12.598
You don't know my mum.

59:12.599 --> 59:15.359
Well...I'll fix it
with your mum then.

59:15.360 --> 59:18.638
Don't you worry about that.
I'll talk to her about it.

59:18.639 --> 59:23.078
What we got to do is beat that
mongrel Father Benedictus to Broome.

59:32.400 --> 59:34.940
OK, you can go now.

59:37.400 --> 59:39.090
Come on, Willie.

59:43.639 --> 59:45.118
Come on, Willie.

59:45.119 --> 59:47.158
Stand up. Come on, Willie.

59:47.159 --> 59:47.989
Willie?

59:52.840 --> 59:53.740
Get up!

01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:05.390
Hey.

01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:11.630
We're going to Broome.

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:14.460
Today is a bran nue dae.

01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:25.740
Come on, boy. Let's go.

01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:51.678
See, I told you
it's just up the road.

01:00:51.679 --> 01:00:53.598
So where do we go now?

01:00:53.599 --> 01:00:55.879
Turn here, turn here, turn here.
We go to Roebuck first.

01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:57.879
I need a drink.

01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:00.900
You and me both, fella.
Yeah.

01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:12.439
Let me out! Let me out!

01:01:14.039 --> 01:01:15.518
The Roey Hotel!

01:01:15.519 --> 01:01:17.959
But, Uncle, you promised.
Wait, Uncle!

01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:21.799
It's been a long time between drinks
and I'll talk to your mummy later,

01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:25.598
but now, just one drink,
just one little drink.

01:01:25.599 --> 01:01:29.359
Hey! Roxanne, here
for a proper good time!

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.038
Willie, Willie!

01:02:46.039 --> 01:02:48.279
Get up, get up!
Come on. Come on, Willie!

01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:50.799
Come here. Come on, get up, man.

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:53.839
Get up, get up, get up.
What's wrong with you?

01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:55.598
That's him there.

01:02:55.599 --> 01:02:56.809
Who's him?

01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:08.530
Oh, Lordy, Lordy!

01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:11.270
Willie!

01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:14.638
Now you can find him, you wanna
get up there and grab him.

01:03:14.639 --> 01:03:16.158
But I feel big shame. I'm dirty.

01:03:16.159 --> 01:03:18.469
We all dirty. Come on.

01:03:21.159 --> 01:03:21.749
Yes!

01:03:28.159 --> 01:03:33.149
Hello, my dear. My name is Tadpole.
Steven Johnson.

01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:34.740
Uncle Tadpole.

01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:38.118
And this here my boy...
Well, he was here.

01:03:38.119 --> 01:03:39.598
What's his name?

01:03:39.599 --> 01:03:40.429
Willie.

01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:42.740
Willie?
Yeah.

01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:45.260
And he want to see you.

01:03:49.119 --> 01:03:53.699
Well, you can tell Willie
that he's too late.

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:04.279
Hello, Willie.

01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:05.660
Hello, Rosie.

01:04:12.199 --> 01:04:13.678
Well, I'd better go now.

01:04:13.679 --> 01:04:15.919
Hey, wait. I wanna talk to you.

01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:17.140
What about?

01:04:18.719 --> 01:04:20.198
Excuse me, who are you?

01:04:20.199 --> 01:04:22.279
Oh...I remember now.

01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:25.870
You're that little boy.

01:04:28.079 --> 01:04:30.319
Rosie's little friend.

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:32.118
Rosie, leave us.

01:04:32.119 --> 01:04:32.869
What?!

01:04:33.119 --> 01:04:34.799
I said get out.

01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:40.240
Hey, don't talk to her like that.

01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:43.360
Listen, Lester. Just move.

01:04:46.119 --> 01:04:47.579
Rosie.

01:04:50.079 --> 01:04:53.509
Alright, everyone, last drinks!

01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:56.198
Rosie, wait. Rosie! Rosie!

01:04:56.199 --> 01:05:01.399
Hey, I told you, didn't I?
Stay away from my woman.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.439
- Willie!
- No, let it go.

01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:05.500
Stand up!

01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:12.518
Willie! Willie!

01:05:12.519 --> 01:05:15.319
Hey, Willie! Give him
the old one-two-three, Willie!

01:05:24.239 --> 01:05:26.719
Willie, watch out!

01:05:28.679 --> 01:05:30.219
Willie. Willie.

01:05:31.079 --> 01:05:32.999
Willie, say something.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.718
Talk to me. Say something.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.920
I love you, Rosie.

01:05:38.079 --> 01:05:39.299
Oh, Willie.

01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:49.678
Quick, Willie.
Your mum's coming. Get up.

01:06:17.039 --> 01:06:21.198
Brothers and sisters!
Tonight, it's the night of miracles!

01:06:21.199 --> 01:06:22.439
Hallelujah!

01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:24.319
Come and be reborn.

01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:25.319
Be reborn.
Yes!

01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:27.118
Leave this house of sin!

01:06:27.119 --> 01:06:29.038
Leave this house of sin.
Leave it.

01:06:29.039 --> 01:06:31.279
Come and join us, sister!

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:34.670
Come.

01:06:35.199 --> 01:06:37.749
Come and join us, sister.

01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:41.140
Come and join us, sister, brother.

01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:56.140
Why don't you let a proper Kimberley
woman show you proper good time?

01:06:58.599 --> 01:07:00.799
I thought you were ashamed of me.

01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:04.050
I could never be ashamed of you.

01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:31.880
Do you believe?

01:07:32.199 --> 01:07:33.439
We believe.

01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:36.078
Tonight is the night of miracles.

01:07:36.079 --> 01:07:36.669
Yes!

01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:41.638
Are there anyone among you
who wants to testify?

01:07:41.639 --> 01:07:45.679
I can feel
that someone need to testify.

01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:50.238
I wanna testify.
Shut up, Annie.

01:07:50.239 --> 01:07:52.118
Are you a sinner, woman?

01:07:52.119 --> 01:07:56.078
Oh, yes. I've been a bad person.
I've been bent on free love.

01:07:56.079 --> 01:07:58.558
I had a child out of wedlock
when I was 16

01:07:58.559 --> 01:08:01.198
and I gave it away
and I'm not worthy.

01:08:01.199 --> 01:08:04.359
I'm a sinner and I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:06.718
Let's sing it one more time
for our sister.

01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:17.229
I too have lost a child
and I too have been a sinner.

01:08:18.078 --> 01:08:21.089
I had a child to another man.

01:08:21.479 --> 01:08:23.999
Behold! A vision from God!

01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:37.358
We are all sinners, my children.

01:08:37.359 --> 01:08:40.118
We are all angels und devils.

01:08:40.118 --> 01:08:43.759
Lux in tenebris!
Light in the darkness.

01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:46.799
I had a child to that man there!

01:08:48.399 --> 01:08:53.059
He took my child away to Germany
20 years ago.

01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:57.120
Mein vater! Mein vater!

01:09:00.319 --> 01:09:02.089
Wolfgang? My son?

01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:04.460
My son!

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:06.158
My father.

01:09:06.158 --> 01:09:09.658
Wolfy, this is your mother, Theresa.

01:09:10.238 --> 01:09:16.169
Well, not the Mother Theresa,
but she is your mother Theresa.

01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:18.180
Hello, Theresa.

01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:21.140
Meine Mutter?

01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:24.899
Meine Mutter?

01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:29.300
Meine Mutter?

01:09:29.439 --> 01:09:31.118
My son? My son!

01:09:31.520 --> 01:09:34.470
My prayers have been answered.

01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:37.310
Willie, you have a brother.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.839
I am an Aborigine!

01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:55.679
I got a story to tell
if anyone wanna listen.

01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:58.639
When I was young I got married,

01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:02.599
but my wife
had a child to another man.

01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:05.070
Where is that woman now?

01:10:06.039 --> 01:10:08.278
That's her right there.

01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:11.930
Steven? Steven Johnson.

01:10:15.279 --> 01:10:17.879
He's returned to be saved!

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:20.398
No more drinking.
No more loose women.

01:10:20.399 --> 01:10:21.999
No, no, no. Hang on a minute.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.999
I never meant to do it, Steven.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.540
It was the devil's work.

01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:31.078
Where are you going?

01:10:31.079 --> 01:10:32.639
I need a drink.

01:10:32.640 --> 01:10:34.799
You don't need a drink, Steven.
Wait for me!

01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:35.550
Mutti?

01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:37.358
Wait for me, Steven!

01:10:37.359 --> 01:10:39.519
Wait for me! My mutti!

01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:42.080
Mutti, please wait! Mutti!

01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:43.820
Mum?

01:10:44.319 --> 01:10:46.959
Willie? What are doing here?

01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:49.799
You're meant to be in school.
Did you bring him?

01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:50.310
No.

01:10:51.399 --> 01:10:52.839
I ran away from Clontarf.

01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:54.519
You run away?!

01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:58.679
I work like a dog for you
to study hard and be a priest

01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:00.238
and you run away?!

01:11:00.239 --> 01:11:02.358
And what are you doing
with that girl?!

01:11:02.359 --> 01:11:04.238
Have you turned your back on God?

01:11:04.239 --> 01:11:05.519
No, Mum, I haven't.

01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:07.719
Oh, Lord. Have you lost your faith?

01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:09.719
No, Mum, I just don't want
to be a priest.

01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:12.278
I don't understand.

01:11:12.279 --> 01:11:13.919
What do you want, Willie?

01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:15.290
I want this!

01:11:15.479 --> 01:11:18.158
To be at home,
under the stars, fishing,

01:11:18.159 --> 01:11:22.109
to be with you and with my girl, Rosie.

01:11:25.079 --> 01:11:27.939
God is here. This is heaven.

01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:37.038
Well, you better talk to your father
about what he thinks.

01:11:37.039 --> 01:11:41.198
No, not that Father, your father -
Steven Johnson Tadpole.

01:11:42.279 --> 01:11:43.109
Willie?

01:11:43.319 --> 01:11:44.779
Uncle Tadpole?

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:50.830
Willie.

01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:53.940
Mein brother!

01:11:57.159 --> 01:12:00.198
We are all one in the eyes of God.

01:12:00.199 --> 01:12:03.158
We thank the Lord
for everything he provides

01:12:03.159 --> 01:12:04.999
and for watching over his flock.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:05.670
Amen.

01:12:06.079 --> 01:12:07.078
Amen.

01:12:07.079 --> 01:12:09.278
Come on, you mob,
soup's getting cold.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.198
Actually,
I've got another confession.

01:12:14.199 --> 01:12:16.959
I was adopted out as a child.

01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:21.438
All I remember is being pulled
from a sea of wailing black faces

01:12:21.439 --> 01:12:24.038
and being raised in the city
to be white.

01:12:24.039 --> 01:12:28.679
Yeah, I'm one of you guys.
I'm an Aborigine too.

01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:31.300
You've got to be kidding.

01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:36.670
Today, everyone's an Aborigine!

01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:37.980
Yeah!

01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:54.559
This song is called 'Millya
Rumarra' which means bran nue dae.

01:19:08.039 --> 01:19:13.029
This fella song is all about
the Aboriginal people.

01:19:13.319 --> 01:19:14.939
Coloured people.

01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:18.640
Black people, long Australia.

01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:19.278
Other day I bin go along
to social security.

01:20:19.279 --> 01:20:21.659
I bin asked for a job.

01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:26.720
They bin say,
"What's your working experience?"

01:20:26.840 --> 01:20:28.879
I bin tell them I got nothing.

01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:30.719
They say, "How come?"

01:20:55.880 --> 01:20:59.450
Yeah, they bin talk about this kind,

01:21:00.239 --> 01:21:03.419
that kind, any kind, every kind.

01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:07.000
But still same kind.

01:21:07.319 --> 01:21:09.789
And, boy, make me slack.

01:21:16.199 --> 01:21:18.119
Bran nue dae. Mmm.
