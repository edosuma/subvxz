16:49.042 --> 16:50.108
DARTH MAUL: Me.

16:57.182 --> 16:58.516
You must go now.

16:58.518 --> 16:59.317
I led him to you.

16:59.319 --> 17:01.619
Let me make it right.

17:01.621 --> 17:03.955
That is not
your responsibility.

17:03.957 --> 17:06.124
I will mend this old wound.

17:07.726 --> 17:10.728
Ride north.
That is your way out.

17:13.665 --> 17:14.966
Your way home.

17:22.908 --> 17:24.542
(GRUNTS)

17:26.879 --> 17:28.713
See you soon, apprentice.

17:30.983 --> 17:34.919
(SIGHS) Look what
has become of you.

17:34.921 --> 17:36.988
A rat in the desert.

17:38.023 --> 17:39.257
Look what I have risen above.

17:39.259 --> 17:42.193
I've come to kill you,

17:42.195 --> 17:45.696
but perhaps it's worse
to leave you here,

17:45.698 --> 17:49.734
festering in your squalor.

17:49.736 --> 17:52.937
If you define yourself
by your power to take life,

17:52.939 --> 17:55.173
a desire to dominate,
to possess,

17:55.175 --> 17:57.975
then you have nothing.

17:58.277 --> 18:00.278
(GRUNTS)

18:01.713 --> 18:03.281
And what do you have?

18:09.254 --> 18:12.757
Why come to this place?

18:13.625 --> 18:16.260
Not simply to hide.

18:16.962 --> 18:20.731
Oh, you have a purpose here.

18:20.733 --> 18:23.868
Perhaps you are
protecting something.

18:24.236 --> 18:26.704
No.

18:26.706 --> 18:28.706
Protecting someone.

18:30.776 --> 18:32.677
(LIGHTSABER WHOOSHES)

18:39.284 --> 18:42.286
(LIGHTSABER WHOOSHING)

19:07.846 --> 19:09.046
(GRUNTS)

19:29.034 --> 19:31.769
Tell me.

19:31.771 --> 19:33.838
Is it the Chosen One?

19:33.840 --> 19:36.040
He is.

19:38.944 --> 19:42.680
He will avenge us.

20:00.065 --> 20:01.866
(ENGINE WHOOSHING)

20:36.768 --> 20:39.604
Tell me this means
what I want it to mean.

20:39.606 --> 20:41.072
We won't be seeing Maul again.

20:43.742 --> 20:44.942
Well?

20:44.944 --> 20:46.077
I'm sorry I ran off like that.

20:46.079 --> 20:48.779
I was wrong.

20:50.115 --> 20:52.216
This is where
I'm supposed to be.

20:52.218 --> 20:53.951
You're my family,

20:53.953 --> 20:55.786
and we should go home.

21:03.195 --> 21:05.162
(GRUNTING)

21:13.872 --> 21:15.306
WOMAN: Luke!

21:15.974 --> 21:16.774
Luke!
