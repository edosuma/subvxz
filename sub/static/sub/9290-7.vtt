00:12.200 --> 00:14.679
Previously on 24.

00:14.758 --> 00:17.591
My office has just learned that the woman
with whom the president...

00:17.709 --> 00:20.030
is currently involved,
Dr. Anne Packard...

00:20.148 --> 00:24.988
is being accused of helping to fabricate
the results of a clinical drug trial.

00:25.106 --> 00:28.726
We got hit hard. Voters who were on the fence
may have just fallen into Keeler's camp.

00:28.805 --> 00:31.598
That is ridiculous.
Once they find out that Ted was lying and...

00:31.677 --> 00:34.392
And how are they supposed to do that, Anne?
It's he said, she said.

00:34.510 --> 00:38.484
See, this is politics. It's not medicine.
So do me a favor and stay out of it.

00:38.563 --> 00:40.727
I'm taking over for Tony.
Give me an update.

00:40.845 --> 00:42.655
We're trying to make
contact with the chopper.

00:42.773 --> 00:44.662
Now that we have Kyle Singer
and the virus has been contained...

00:44.740 --> 00:48.282
we need to contact Jack, let him know that
the attempted escape of Salazar is pointless.

00:48.360 --> 00:51.902
Salazar's terrorist connections
are a serious threat to this country.

00:52.020 --> 00:54.892
- Both Salazar and Bauer are expendable.
- What's going on, Chase?

00:54.971 --> 00:56.741
Your dad got out of the chopper
before I could tell him about Kyle Singer.

00:56.859 --> 00:59.614
He and Salazar are on the run.
The only thing that matters right now...

00:59.732 --> 01:01.817
is getting word to him that
the virus has been contained.

01:01.896 --> 01:04.690
That way he'll turn Salazar over.

01:04.768 --> 01:07.877
Your brother gave the F.B.I.
Contact instructions in his last call.

01:07.995 --> 01:10.710
He's got a plane circling
waiting to pick you up.

01:10.828 --> 01:12.795
You really are the best, Jack.

01:12.913 --> 01:15.589
What the hell's going on?

01:15.707 --> 01:18.265
You didn't think I was gonna let you
just deliver me and leave, did you?

01:18.383 --> 01:20.665
Ramon...

01:36.601 --> 01:38.843
Adam!

01:38.922 --> 01:41.165
Adam, there's something
seriously wrong...

01:41.244 --> 01:44.391
I just remembered.
I forgot to close that file.

01:47.224 --> 01:51.474
The following takes place
between 7:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m.

01:52.969 --> 01:55.094
- Gael, what are you doing? Let me go!
- I'm sorry, Kim.

01:55.173 --> 01:58.084
You shouldn't have
walked into this.

01:58.202 --> 02:00.799
Calm down. I have to ask you
a few questions, okay?

02:00.917 --> 02:05.324
Now this room is soundproof. So if you scream,
it won't do anything but make me mad.

02:05.403 --> 02:08.669
And you don't want to do that.

02:08.787 --> 02:10.833
So we're gonna be all right here?

02:15.791 --> 02:17.640
What are you doing to my father?

02:17.719 --> 02:19.607
I'll ask the questions, huh?

02:23.739 --> 02:27.870
Now, you came in here to bring
the logs back up to date.

02:27.988 --> 02:30.349
When do they expect you to finish?

02:35.032 --> 02:38.770
- Don't make me ask you twice.
- I don't know, 10 minutes.

02:38.848 --> 02:40.737
And after that,
what are you working on?

02:40.855 --> 02:45.026
- Just utility work.
- Good.

02:45.144 --> 02:48.725
What do you think you're doing?
This isn't gonna work...

03:20.675 --> 03:22.524
- Adam?
- Yeah?

03:22.642 --> 03:24.570
I don't know if you've gotten word,
but Tony's out of surgery.

03:24.649 --> 03:26.616
I'm trying to head over
there in a few minutes.

03:26.695 --> 03:28.859
- Well, who's gonna be in charge
when you're gone?
- Gael.

03:28.977 --> 03:32.282
I want you to unmount all my directories
and transfer them over to his system, okay?

03:32.361 --> 03:34.210
- Sure.
- Anything new on Jack?

03:34.328 --> 03:37.712
No. Our last location on him was
the downtown subway station and
Chase lost his trail after that.

03:37.791 --> 03:41.096
- Have we contacted L.A.P.D?
- Yeah. They're all over it. So is local F.B.I.

03:41.214 --> 03:43.457
- Great.
- But I think we're going
about this the wrong way.

03:43.575 --> 03:47.234
Jack broke Salazar out of jail
because he thought it was the
only way to stop the bio-threat.

03:47.352 --> 03:49.753
But now that we have Kyle Singer,
there is no threat.

03:49.871 --> 03:52.507
We should just saturate the media
and maybe Jack will get the message.

03:52.586 --> 03:55.852
The president made it clear. He does not want
the public to know about the bio-threat...

03:55.930 --> 03:57.780
not at this point.

03:57.858 --> 04:01.281
- We have to find Jack and Salazar ourselves.
- Yeah.

04:04.036 --> 04:06.121
- Dessler.
- Michelle, it's me.

04:06.200 --> 04:08.679
Gael, why aren't you in the teleconference
room? The briefing's about to begin.

04:08.797 --> 04:12.220
Yeah, well, Kim bumped into some
embedded no-ops in the log files.

04:12.299 --> 04:15.407
- It'll take a few minutes.
- She can handle that.

04:15.486 --> 04:17.334
I'm trying to head
over to the hospital.

04:17.414 --> 04:19.696
I need you up to speed,
so you can take over for me.

04:19.774 --> 04:22.136
- On my way.
- Thank you.

04:30.084 --> 04:31.973
I'm watching you.
So don't try anything.

04:33.822 --> 04:36.380
All right?

05:12.186 --> 05:15.452
- Transfer all blue alert key codes to Gael.
- Anything else?

05:15.530 --> 05:17.734
That's it. Thanks.

05:21.747 --> 05:25.328
There is no longer an outbreak threat
for the city of Los Angeles.

05:26.587 --> 05:29.538
Kyle Singer, who was being
held by Salazar's people...

05:29.656 --> 05:32.922
was not carrying the Cordilla virus
and turns out to be perfectly healthy.

05:33.001 --> 05:36.345
But we do know Salazar's
organization has the virus...

05:36.463 --> 05:39.454
which means finding Ramon Salazar
is our top priority.

05:40.555 --> 05:42.562
Thank you for joining us, Gael.

05:42.680 --> 05:45.789
- If you're taking over for Michelle, be on time.
- Sorry.

05:45.867 --> 05:47.677
I was just saying
from this moment on...

05:47.795 --> 05:51.258
we are focused on one thing only
and that's finding Ramon Salazar.

05:51.337 --> 05:55.704
- "Adam, where are we on that?"
- After Jack and Ramon ditched the
chopper, we lost their trail.

05:55.783 --> 05:57.986
- For all we know, they're still in L.A.
- They won't be for long.

05:58.104 --> 05:59.914
We suspect they're heading
for the Mexican border.

06:00.032 --> 06:03.731
We've contacted the Mexican government,
as well as the Central American allies.

06:03.810 --> 06:05.816
We're asking them to monitor
all air corridors.

06:05.895 --> 06:09.122
- What about Chase Edmunds?
- I'm assuming that he's coming back here.

06:09.240 --> 06:10.971
Don't assume anything.

06:16.126 --> 06:18.054
"Ramon, have a drink. You're a free man."

06:21.634 --> 06:23.523
Thank you.

07:01.100 --> 07:03.421
Ramon!

07:09.953 --> 07:12.550
Hello, Jack.

07:12.668 --> 07:16.091
The party's going well.
I wanted you to know.

07:16.209 --> 07:18.019
There's something else
I want you to know.

07:18.137 --> 07:20.813
For some reason,
Hector wants you alive.

07:20.892 --> 07:25.299
Maybe he wants to kill you himself
or maybe he wants to watch me do it.

07:25.377 --> 07:27.935
I'm just not sure
I can wait that long.

07:28.053 --> 07:30.178
Ramon, let's get back to the party.

07:30.256 --> 07:33.601
Come on, the girls.
Sandra is waiting.

07:45.090 --> 07:49.458
- Yeah?
- Chase, this is Ryan Chappelle.
What are you doing?

07:49.537 --> 07:52.094
- I'm trying to find Jack.
- So is the rest of C.T.U.

07:52.212 --> 07:55.321
- Well, I may have a thread.
- Tell me.

07:55.399 --> 07:58.862
Jack and I back-pocketed some of Hector
Salazar's contacts that aren't on the books.

07:58.941 --> 08:01.341
If you have any information,
we'll pass it on to another field team.

08:01.420 --> 08:03.780
- I want you back here.
- Ryan, there's no time for that.

08:03.938 --> 08:06.771
As soon as Jack hands Ramon Salazar
over to his brother, they're gonna kill him.

08:06.850 --> 08:09.997
- Jack may already be dead.
- Well, I'm not stopping until I know for sure.

08:10.115 --> 08:14.483
- Chase, I want you back here now.
- Why?

08:14.562 --> 08:17.473
Because I just found out
Jack's been using heroin.

08:17.591 --> 08:20.975
And since you're his partner,
you must have known.

08:21.054 --> 08:22.903
No, I had no idea.

08:22.982 --> 08:26.563
I don't believe you. I believe you've
been covering for him all along.

08:26.681 --> 08:30.143
Sir, the only thing that matters right now
is finding Jack, and I can't do that from C.T.U.

08:30.222 --> 08:32.582
If you even want a chance
of keeping your job...

08:32.740 --> 08:35.534
you'll get back here now
and debrief me on Bauer.

08:35.652 --> 08:38.131
- Do you understand?
- Yes, I understand.

08:38.210 --> 08:40.256
Good.

08:44.977 --> 08:47.417
O'Brian.

08:47.496 --> 08:49.660
- Chloe, is Kim up there?
- No.

08:49.738 --> 08:51.784
- Are your logs still lagging by six hours?
- Let me check.

08:51.903 --> 08:54.303
Yep.

08:54.421 --> 08:57.254
- I thought Kim was supposed
to take care of that.
- I don't know what Kim's doing.

08:57.372 --> 08:59.261
I don't follow her schedule that closely.

09:02.054 --> 09:04.218
Gael. Are you going back
to tech one right now?

09:04.297 --> 09:06.500
No, not right now. Why?

09:06.619 --> 09:08.979
Uh, I just need something from Kim.
It's cool. I'll get her.

09:09.058 --> 09:12.324
- No, no. She's not there.
- Yes, she is. She's backing up logs.

09:12.442 --> 09:15.629
She was, but Chappelle asked her to
bring a mirror drive down to networking.

09:15.747 --> 09:18.423
- She'll be back in a few minutes.
What do you need?
- What do I need?

09:18.501 --> 09:22.908
I need to find Jack. We're dead-ending
everywhere. Kim's his daughter.

09:22.987 --> 09:24.876
Maybe there's something we're
overlooking she can help us with.

09:24.994 --> 09:27.945
As soon as she gets back,
I'll send her over, okay?

09:28.063 --> 09:30.188
Yeah. Okay.

09:32.627 --> 09:37.034
Gael. I had Adam transfer all my directories
over to your system. You're good to go.

09:37.152 --> 09:40.851
- Thanks. Great.
- "Oh, hold on. I wanna go over"
the dispatches from Division.

09:40.930 --> 09:44.195
There's 17 units out in the field.
Five of them are still downtown.

09:44.274 --> 09:46.910
- They're trying to pick up Jack's trail.
- And the other 12?

09:46.989 --> 09:51.042
Health Services, L.A.X., um, hold on,
let me pull up the rest for you.

10:32.868 --> 10:37.039
This is the matrix
I use to balance resources.

10:37.157 --> 10:39.046
I'll transfer it to you.

10:45.617 --> 10:48.765
- Is Tony out of surgery?
- Yeah.

10:48.843 --> 10:51.558
- Is he gonna be okay?
- Hope so.

11:11.154 --> 11:13.239
- Dessler.
- Michelle, is Gael still with you?

11:13.318 --> 11:15.167
- Yeah. Why?
- I can't get into tech one.

11:15.246 --> 11:17.016
I'm having trouble
with the access code.

11:17.095 --> 11:20.322
- Did you change the access code to tech one?
- No. Why? What's going on?

11:20.440 --> 11:22.722
- Adam can't get in.
- What does he need?

11:22.840 --> 11:25.791
- What do you need, Adam?
- I'm looking for Kim, and she was in there.

11:25.909 --> 11:27.916
- Did you try calling her?
- There's something wrong with the phone.

11:28.034 --> 11:31.811
- Um, can you override the door?
'Cause it's tweaked.
- Yeah, sure.

11:31.968 --> 11:35.116
What are you doing?

11:35.234 --> 11:37.792
Overriding the access code.
Probably something wrong with the keypad.

11:37.871 --> 11:41.294
Okay, I'm resetting it
to one, two, three, four.

11:41.412 --> 11:44.874
- It'll take 15 seconds to sync though.
- Thanks.

11:46.448 --> 11:49.478
Okay, I'm sending everything related
to the virus over to volume "A."

11:49.557 --> 11:51.682
Where do you want the Salazar file?

11:57.702 --> 12:01.479
Kim?

12:03.210 --> 12:05.414
Oh, my God! Kim!

12:07.066 --> 12:09.388
- Kim...
- Adam, it was Gael.

12:11.198 --> 12:13.205
- Hi.
- How you doing?

12:19.264 --> 12:21.468
Section five is clear.

12:21.546 --> 12:24.379
I have a visual on the subject.
Section five.

12:26.701 --> 12:29.180
- "Block him off on the other side."
- "Franklin, get down here!"

12:29.258 --> 12:32.052
This is Franklin. I'm on it!
I'm heading down the stairwell now.

12:33.980 --> 12:37.836
Section seven. I'm locking down the east
corridor. I do not have a visual on the subject.

12:37.954 --> 12:40.236
I repeat, I do not have
a visual on the subject.

12:40.354 --> 12:42.361
Please advise.

12:52.513 --> 12:54.834
We need backup in section seven.

13:01.720 --> 13:03.806
Put it down! Put it down!
Don't do it!

13:03.884 --> 13:07.740
Put it down now.

13:10.416 --> 13:14.272
- "Gael."
- Don't get in my way, Michelle!

13:14.390 --> 13:16.515
External security is already in position.

13:16.594 --> 13:18.443
You're not going anywhere.

13:22.417 --> 13:26.116
You take one step outside,
you know exactly what will happen.

14:03.338 --> 14:06.211
Yeah, okay, I will. Thanks.

14:08.808 --> 14:11.916
- What did they say?
- They haven't found Jack Bauer yet.

14:12.034 --> 14:15.064
- "They're not even sure if he's still in the city."
- He's not in the city.

14:15.143 --> 14:20.612
His plan was to take Ramon Salazar back
to his brother to prevent the outbreak.

14:20.691 --> 14:24.035
That's what he's gonna do,
even if it costs him his life.

14:24.153 --> 14:27.773
You know, David, that's probably true. But
there's nothing we can do about that now.

14:27.852 --> 14:30.764
Our intelligence and military services
are working overtime on that front.

14:30.882 --> 14:33.912
So, let them do their job.

14:35.603 --> 14:38.043
We, unfortunately,
have other fires to put out.

14:56.064 --> 14:56.969
Anne?

15:04.839 --> 15:07.790
- David, I'm sorry about Ted and the debate.
- I don't want to hear it.

15:07.908 --> 15:11.764
- It's not your fault.
- I was the one that told you to stand up to him.

15:11.882 --> 15:14.046
But maybe I was wrong. Maybe
you should have just paid him off.

15:14.125 --> 15:17.194
We're not wrong.

15:17.273 --> 15:19.751
Mr. President.

15:19.830 --> 15:21.797
We have a lot of work to do.

15:41.196 --> 15:43.793
I still can't believe Gael
could be a traitor.

15:43.911 --> 15:46.311
Has he said anything?

15:46.429 --> 15:49.262
We haven't gone in yet.
We're sweating him first.

15:51.584 --> 15:55.794
Listen, Ryan. Tony's out of surgery.
I wanna be there when he wakes up.

15:55.912 --> 15:59.847
And I need you here.
We just uncovered a mole.

15:59.965 --> 16:02.325
We don't know how badly we've
been compromised by Salazar.

16:02.444 --> 16:06.575
But you're handling that. Anything
that spills over, you can give to Chloe.

16:06.693 --> 16:10.116
- Chloe's a pain in the ass.
- She can do it.

16:10.195 --> 16:12.084
At least until I get back.

16:15.546 --> 16:17.789
Fine. If you think you're dispensable.

16:19.206 --> 16:21.724
I just wanna be with my husband.

16:26.209 --> 16:28.728
- All right.
- Thank you.

16:33.567 --> 16:35.535
All right, let's do this.

16:46.631 --> 16:48.520
You had us, Gael.

16:50.015 --> 16:53.044
Now we have you.

16:53.163 --> 16:57.137
You working alone or does Salazar
have other moles inside?

16:59.655 --> 17:04.061
You know Johnson.
You know what Johnson does.

17:04.140 --> 17:07.367
And you know that sooner or later
you're going to tell me what you know.

17:07.484 --> 17:10.279
The only question is how hard
you wanna make this on yourself.

17:12.285 --> 17:15.590
Kim says you were monitoring a plane
that had Jack Bauer on it.

17:15.669 --> 17:18.502
- Is that true?
- I have nothing to say.

17:18.580 --> 17:22.476
If it's the last thing you ever do...

17:22.594 --> 17:24.915
you're going to tell me
where that plane is landing.

18:11.543 --> 18:14.258
What is it, Ramon, huh?
Don't you like the girls?

18:14.376 --> 18:16.697
Tell me again why
Hector wants Bauer alive.

18:16.776 --> 18:22.088
- I don't know. He didn't say, but l...
- But? But nothing.

18:22.206 --> 18:24.685
Every time Bauer takes a breath
is an insult to me.

18:24.803 --> 18:27.754
I spent three months in prison
because of his betrayal.

18:27.872 --> 18:31.413
I know, Ramon. And I'm sure that
Hector feels the same way.

18:31.531 --> 18:33.341
Then he won't mind.

18:33.420 --> 18:35.309
Ramon, no!

18:36.765 --> 18:39.244
Are you giving me an order, Tomas?

18:40.345 --> 18:43.808
Ramon, I work for you and your brother.

18:43.887 --> 18:45.736
I love and respect both of you.

18:45.815 --> 18:49.631
Hector instructed me to keep Bauer alive
until the plane lands.

18:49.749 --> 18:52.622
And I'm instructing you to sit down.

18:52.700 --> 18:56.084
Why won't you honor the one wish of your
brother, who arranged for your escape today?

18:57.776 --> 19:01.908
In less than an hour, I am sure that
you will get your revenge on Bauer.

19:13.004 --> 19:15.561
We'll see.

19:18.867 --> 19:22.132
- Pour me another drink.
- Yes, Ramon.

19:28.861 --> 19:32.441
- Pedro.
- I'm not supposed to talk to you, Jack.

19:32.520 --> 19:36.140
Fine, then listen. I risked my life
getting Ramon out of prison.

19:36.219 --> 19:38.776
You put him in prison.

19:40.508 --> 19:42.750
Pedro, I need to tell Ramon
something. It's important.

19:42.829 --> 19:45.702
- "Before he gets too wasted."
You know what he's like.
- Yeah.

19:45.780 --> 19:48.849
He got drunk one time,
threw some guy off a plane.

19:48.967 --> 19:51.958
He keeps going like this, you
might be landing before we do.

19:52.076 --> 19:55.145
- For God's sake, listen to me.
- No, you listen to me.

19:55.224 --> 19:57.191
I'm not talking to you.

19:57.270 --> 19:59.631
You're a dead man.

20:13.914 --> 20:15.763
Jack?

20:15.881 --> 20:17.691
Jack?

20:17.770 --> 20:20.524
Jack? Quit screwing
around, Jack! Jack!

21:06.443 --> 21:09.866
Bottom line is I think we can explain
the national security issue that
pulled you off stage...

21:09.984 --> 21:12.817
but the allegation against Anne
is going to be a lot harder to handle.

21:14.666 --> 21:16.516
Her ex-husband clearly
had his own agenda.

21:16.594 --> 21:18.483
It shouldn't be difficult
to prove he's a liar.

21:18.640 --> 21:21.710
I understand that, but this is dirty laundry, and
we both know the public wants to hear it...

21:21.788 --> 21:25.290
and unless you can offer the public
something definitive, Anne is going to hurt you.

21:25.369 --> 21:27.769
Jerry's right.

21:29.894 --> 21:33.081
Listen, David, I'm your brother,
I'm your advisor, and I do have
some perspective on this thing.

21:33.199 --> 21:35.245
Now do you wanna hear it?

21:36.937 --> 21:38.826
Yes, I want to hear it.

21:40.793 --> 21:43.193
- Distance yourself from Anne.
- Oh, Wayne...

21:43.311 --> 21:45.869
Before you shut me down,
just hear me out.

21:45.948 --> 21:49.174
You used up the public's
goodwill with Sherry.

21:49.292 --> 21:52.440
They don't want to hear about
your being involved with someone
else who's not trustworthy.

21:52.558 --> 21:57.162
You have got to respect
the people who voted for you.

22:07.549 --> 22:10.107
I'm sure they won't have a problem with that.

22:12.311 --> 22:16.560
- Hello?
- Anne, it's me, Ted. We need to talk.

22:18.685 --> 22:23.052
About what? What could you
possibly have to say to me?

22:23.131 --> 22:26.318
After what you have done, I can't believe
you even have the audacity to call.

22:26.397 --> 22:30.017
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, that's great. Now everything's all right.

22:30.096 --> 22:32.693
That's why I called,
because I want to make it right.

22:32.811 --> 22:35.801
How? How can you possibly undo
the damage you've done?

22:35.919 --> 22:38.555
I'm up in my office.
Come up and I'll explain everything.

22:38.673 --> 22:41.743
- I'm not coming over there.
- Anne, listen to me.

22:41.861 --> 22:44.694
I have some documents
that'll prove your innocence.

22:44.851 --> 22:46.818
- What kind of documents?
- Letters and memos.

22:47.881 --> 22:50.674
Please, this is how
I want to do it.

22:50.792 --> 22:53.232
I wanna give them to you personally.
I promise I won't make a scene.

22:53.350 --> 22:55.711
- I'll send someone over to get them.
- No!

22:55.790 --> 22:59.410
Now we will do this my way,
or I swear I'll burn them right now.

23:04.013 --> 23:08.460
All right. But you better not be wasting my time.

23:59.336 --> 24:01.343
Simon, we need to talk.

24:01.421 --> 24:04.569
Chase Edmunds. Sorry, but
I'm having dinner right now.

24:09.133 --> 24:11.376
- What do you want?
- I want information.

24:11.494 --> 24:13.265
- Look, are you crazy?
- Simon, what's going on?

24:13.344 --> 24:16.570
- Rita, take the kids upstairs. Everything will be fine.
- "Come on, kids."

24:16.688 --> 24:19.993
- Now what do you want?
- Ramon Salazar broke out of federal prison today.

24:20.111 --> 24:22.984
He is gonna hook up
with his brother, Hector.

24:23.062 --> 24:24.991
I told you and Bauer that
I'm a legitimate accountant.

24:25.109 --> 24:27.981
I don't have any business
dealings with the Salazars.

24:28.060 --> 24:30.775
Simon, I did not
come here to bust you...

24:30.893 --> 24:34.001
but I am not leaving
until I know where Hector is.

24:34.119 --> 24:36.087
Do you understand me?

24:37.778 --> 24:39.864
I don't know where Hector is now.

24:41.359 --> 24:43.759
He left Colombia over
two weeks ago.

24:43.877 --> 24:46.868
- And he didn't tell you where he was going?
- No.

24:49.543 --> 24:53.045
- You're tied into his money flow, right?
- Yes, some of it.

24:53.163 --> 24:55.091
Let's take a look.

25:43.253 --> 25:48.722
Ramon, Hector is meeting us. Just wait a few
minutes. Ramon, please. Hector said...

25:48.801 --> 25:52.106
- Are you ready to die, Jack?
- Back up!

25:52.224 --> 25:54.821
Get back!
Get back or I'll kill him!

25:54.900 --> 25:57.733
- Get back!
- Shoot him, Tomas! Shoot him!

25:57.811 --> 26:01.392
If I die, he dies. Is that what you want
Hector to see when you get off this plane?

26:02.769 --> 26:04.658
Drop the weapons!

26:06.743 --> 26:09.458
Jack, there's no way out of this for you.

26:09.537 --> 26:11.740
He's right.
My brother has an army out there.

26:11.858 --> 26:14.101
We're not in your backyard anymore, Jack.

26:14.219 --> 26:16.816
I'll worry about that.
You just take a seat.

26:16.934 --> 26:20.554
Hey, ladies, don't worry.
Everything is under control.

26:20.633 --> 26:23.584
The party will continue
once we're on the ground.

26:23.702 --> 26:25.709
The big American hero.

26:27.322 --> 26:30.352
Hey, what do you think, Jack?
That Hector's not prepared for you?

26:30.470 --> 26:33.067
- Huh?
- Shut up!

26:38.575 --> 26:41.330
Why do you need so many people
to pick up your brother?

26:41.448 --> 26:43.927
I want to be prepared
when the plane lands.

26:44.005 --> 26:46.484
- Prepared for what?
- Whatever.

26:48.845 --> 26:52.426
I haven't heard from Gael.
He should have checked in by now.

26:52.505 --> 26:54.590
- So why don't you call Ramon's plane?
- It's too risky.

26:54.708 --> 26:56.754
The Americans are checking everything.

26:56.872 --> 26:59.548
Come on, "rapido!"

26:59.666 --> 27:02.696
Come on!

27:02.774 --> 27:06.355
I have to go, okay?
"Rapido," come on.

27:23.156 --> 27:25.714
Who else is working with you, Gael?

27:27.957 --> 27:31.380
Let me make something clear.
I would love nothing more...

27:31.459 --> 27:36.259
than to hang you as a traitor
and watch you jerk till you're dead.

27:36.377 --> 27:38.423
But I'm a realist.

27:38.541 --> 27:42.279
If there are others, tell me now
and we might be able to cut you a deal.

27:50.739 --> 27:52.942
Is that Hector?

27:57.979 --> 28:00.497
Adam, bring me
a tracking node now.

28:00.576 --> 28:03.094
Now! Hector Salazar's calling!

28:03.212 --> 28:05.297
Kim, grab that laptop.

28:16.354 --> 28:21.587
- Put the socket in C-five, Kim.
- Got it.

28:21.745 --> 28:23.830
Hurry up!

28:27.096 --> 28:29.811
Okay, go.

28:29.890 --> 28:34.375
One wrong word, I swear to God
I'll make you regret it.

28:36.264 --> 28:38.153
- Hello?
- Where have you been?

28:39.884 --> 28:41.694
Busy. I don't have a lot of time.

28:41.812 --> 28:44.212
- Where is Ramon?
- On his way to you.

28:44.330 --> 28:47.163
- Is he safe?
- Think so.

28:47.281 --> 28:49.170
What about Bauer?

28:50.587 --> 28:53.656
- Don't know.
- What do you mean you don't know, huh?

28:53.734 --> 28:57.512
- What are you doing there?
- They put me on something else.

28:57.590 --> 28:59.440
They're watching me.

29:00.778 --> 29:04.398
- Call me when you have something.
- Yeah.

29:10.575 --> 29:13.684
- Did we get it?
- No.

29:14.864 --> 29:17.854
Damn it!

29:36.505 --> 29:38.866
Hey.

29:38.945 --> 29:40.833
Hey.

29:42.171 --> 29:46.342
- How you doing?
- You scared the hell out of me.

29:46.421 --> 29:50.041
I... I know. I'm sorry.

29:51.851 --> 29:54.802
- How's he doing, Doctor?
- "We couldn't have hoped for a better result."

29:54.880 --> 29:56.769
He should be on his feet in a few days.

29:56.887 --> 29:59.799
- When can he come home?
- Probably tomorrow.

29:59.917 --> 30:02.278
I just wanna keep an eye on him,
make sure he stays stable.

30:04.403 --> 30:07.157
Listen, uh, Doctor, could we have
a couple minutes, please?

30:07.275 --> 30:09.321
- Of course.
- " Thanks."

30:15.026 --> 30:18.292
- Um, Michelle?
- Yeah.

30:18.410 --> 30:20.692
Did the president
let Salazar out of prison?

30:22.935 --> 30:25.768
No. No, Jack broke him out.

30:25.886 --> 30:28.601
We think he did it so the president
wouldn't have to make the hard choice.

30:28.719 --> 30:30.608
- Did he get away?
- Yeah.

30:32.182 --> 30:34.071
I have to talk to Gael right away.

30:34.228 --> 30:37.061
- Wha... Gael?
- Yeah.

30:39.540 --> 30:41.429
What? Something happen to him?

30:42.963 --> 30:45.324
Tony, Gael's been working
for the Salazars.

30:45.403 --> 30:49.141
- How do you know that?
- He was using tech one to
monitor Salazar's escape.

30:49.259 --> 30:51.147
And then when we found out,
he tried to run.

30:51.265 --> 30:53.469
- Where is he now?
- He's still at C.T.U.

30:53.587 --> 30:56.105
Chappelle and Johnson
are questioning him.

30:56.184 --> 30:58.545
- No, honey, where you going?
- You have to get me over there right now.

30:58.623 --> 31:00.984
No, you're not going anywhere.
Doctor! Doctor!

31:01.102 --> 31:02.755
- Get the car.
- Doctor!

31:02.873 --> 31:05.903
- Mr. Almeida, what are you doing?
- I have to get out of here.

31:05.981 --> 31:08.264
- You can release me to C.T.U. Medical if you want.
- I can't do that.

31:08.342 --> 31:11.215
All right, look, look!

31:11.333 --> 31:15.582
If you're worried about liability,
my wife will sign me out.

31:15.700 --> 31:17.628
Look, Michelle...

31:17.786 --> 31:21.052
if I ever needed you
to trust me, it's now.

31:21.209 --> 31:25.498
You see? These are the bank transfers that
he made from his account in Bogota.

31:25.616 --> 31:27.701
They stopped two weeks ago.

31:27.780 --> 31:30.023
Follow the money.
Where did it go?

31:31.675 --> 31:34.941
Some of it to a bank account
here in L.A...a David Gomez.

31:35.059 --> 31:37.853
- Yeah, we already know about that.
What else?

31:40.056 --> 31:41.866
- Well, that's interesting.
- "What?"

31:41.945 --> 31:44.857
$720,000 deposited.

31:44.975 --> 31:48.044
- I've never seen this account.
- Where is it?

31:49.933 --> 31:52.844
Banco del Oeste.
It's in a town in Mexico.

31:52.962 --> 31:55.559
- Las Nieves.
- Okay, look out.

32:01.501 --> 32:05.593
- That's gotta be it.
- Good. We're done?

32:05.672 --> 32:07.403
- Not quite.
- "What else?"

32:07.482 --> 32:10.275
- "You have a private plane, don't you?"
- Yes.

32:10.393 --> 32:12.715
Clear it for takeoff.

32:18.460 --> 32:20.309
- Hey, Kim.
- Hey, Chloe.

32:20.388 --> 32:24.401
- Did he hurt you? Gael, I mean?
- No.

32:24.480 --> 32:28.454
It's crazy. I mean, he's been here what,
two years, and the C.I.A. Five before that?

32:28.533 --> 32:31.484
- "How does someone like that"
end up a terrorist?
- I don't know, Chloe.

32:34.238 --> 32:38.920
Listen, I want to tell you that I don't
think your dad's a bad person.

32:38.999 --> 32:43.485
- If I ever said anything to offend you, I'm sorry.
- It's okay. Thanks.

32:44.508 --> 32:46.396
There. I said it.

32:54.777 --> 32:57.532
- Hello.
- Kim, it's me. Are you alone?

32:57.610 --> 33:00.011
Hold on.

33:02.804 --> 33:04.693
Where are you?
Chappelle ordered you back here.

33:04.811 --> 33:07.683
Yeah, he did. But listen, I'm not
coming back until I find your father.

33:07.802 --> 33:11.107
- How are you gonna do that?
- I just found out where Hector Salazar is.

33:11.225 --> 33:14.569
A small town in Northern Mexico called Las
Nieves. I'm sure Jack's taking Ramon there now.

33:14.687 --> 33:17.796
No, Chase, it's the other way around.
Ramon's taking my dad.

33:17.914 --> 33:21.967
- How do you know that?
- There was a video feed, and I saw it.

33:22.045 --> 33:25.193
They knocked my dad out
and dragged him onto a plane.

33:25.272 --> 33:27.318
Oh, wait-wait a minute.
A video feed, Kim? I don't understand.

33:27.397 --> 33:30.112
Gael has been working
for the Salazars.

33:30.230 --> 33:32.394
He's been watching everything
through surveillance cameras.

33:32.472 --> 33:36.132
- Gael?
- Yes, Gael's been helping
the Salazars this whole time.

33:36.250 --> 33:39.752
- Well, is Gael talking?
- I don't know. Chappelle's got him now.

33:39.830 --> 33:42.624
But I don't know if they're getting anywhere.
I haven't heard anything.

33:42.742 --> 33:44.552
Okay, Kim,
C.T.U. Has been compromised.

33:44.631 --> 33:47.031
- You cannot tell anyone you've talked to me, okay?
- What about Chappelle?

33:47.110 --> 33:49.746
- Especially not Chappelle.
- You cannot go in there alone.

33:49.825 --> 33:51.477
Hector's gonna have an army down there.

33:51.556 --> 33:53.366
No, I will call for backup
when the time's right.

33:53.484 --> 33:55.845
I need to hear you promise me you're not
gonna tell anyone you talked to me.

33:55.963 --> 33:58.481
- I don't know, Chase.
- Think about it.

33:58.560 --> 34:01.668
- Don't do this to us, Kim.
There's too much at stake.
- I'm not doing anything to us.

34:01.786 --> 34:04.934
This is about your life and my dad's.

34:05.052 --> 34:07.138
Okay, I know what this is about,
damn it. Just listen to me.

34:07.256 --> 34:09.971
I have to go dark. There's no time
to argue about it. Just do this.

34:12.253 --> 34:16.424
- Kim?
- Be careful, Chase.

34:16.502 --> 34:18.627
Kim. Kim!

34:27.833 --> 34:32.083
- So tell me, tough guy, what's the plan?
- You'll know soon enough.

34:32.163 --> 34:36.097
Come on, we're interested.
Tell the girls.

34:36.215 --> 34:41.370
So you think you're gonna land
the plane and arrest Hector?

34:41.487 --> 34:46.013
No. Even the great Jack Bauer
can't take 50 men by himself.

34:46.092 --> 34:51.089
Oh, I got it. You're gonna drop me off,
turn the plane around.

34:51.168 --> 34:53.882
Hey, but wait, you are
a criminal in America.

34:54.001 --> 34:56.125
Wanted. So where will you go?

34:56.243 --> 35:00.493
I don't think a Third World
country will suit you.

35:01.555 --> 35:03.837
I think that's called a dilemma, Jack.

35:03.916 --> 35:05.726
Shut up.

36:13.837 --> 36:16.827
Adam, where's Chappelle?

36:16.945 --> 36:19.621
- He's with Gael.
- Where?

36:19.739 --> 36:22.808
- Interrogation 820.
- Let's go.

36:26.861 --> 36:29.104
What the hell's going on?

36:29.182 --> 36:31.071
I don't know.

36:34.494 --> 36:36.619
Talk to me, you son of a bitch!

36:36.737 --> 36:38.783
Get the door.

36:40.121 --> 36:41.931
- Johnson, that's enough.
- Almeida, what are you doing...

36:42.010 --> 36:43.584
Ryan, get him out of the room.

36:43.702 --> 36:45.787
- "Why?"
- Trust me, Ryan. Get him out of the room.

36:51.532 --> 36:53.460
- You too, Ryan.
- What?

36:53.578 --> 36:56.253
I gotta talk to Gael by myself, all right?
Just trust me on this one.

36:56.371 --> 36:59.952
Michelle, what's going on?

37:00.031 --> 37:02.706
Look, I don't care what's
going on between you two.

37:02.785 --> 37:04.910
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm staying right here.

37:32.689 --> 37:35.011
Ramon!

37:38.434 --> 37:41.818
Ramon!

37:55.747 --> 37:58.659
- Where is Ramon?
- Hector...

37:58.816 --> 38:02.003
Where's my brother?

38:02.082 --> 38:04.443
Kill him! Kill Bauer!

38:04.521 --> 38:08.456
Do you hear me?

38:08.574 --> 38:12.391
- What are you doing, Jack?
- Your brother tried to kill me on the plane!

38:12.509 --> 38:15.499
Why all the guns? This is
not what we talked about!

38:17.900 --> 38:21.952
I was worried. Gael wasn't sure
you were on the plane.

38:22.070 --> 38:24.313
Go see your brother.

38:29.625 --> 38:32.380
- "My brother. I'm so glad to see you."
- What's going on?

38:32.458 --> 38:36.472
- I don't understand.
- I'll tell you in a minute. I promise.

38:46.584 --> 38:48.709
Good job, Jack.

39:00.395 --> 39:03.700
Come, we have a lot of work to do.

39:07.399 --> 39:10.074
What are you doing, Hector?

39:10.153 --> 39:12.160
Come.

39:12.278 --> 39:14.324
I'll explain everything.

39:46.589 --> 39:50.366
He's in.

39:50.445 --> 39:53.042
- What are you talking about? Who's in?
- Jack.

39:53.121 --> 39:55.285
- What?
- Gael and I have been working with Jack.

39:55.364 --> 39:57.921
We've been trying to get him
back undercover with the Salazars.

39:58.000 --> 40:00.321
- That signal means he's back in.
- I don't understand.

40:00.400 --> 40:02.994
Look, I'll explain everything.
Right now, we gotta call the president.
