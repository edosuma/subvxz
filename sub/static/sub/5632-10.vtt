Yeah, not even close.

00:24.815 --> 00:26.448
You the ones who called this in?
Yeah, like, 30 seconds ago.

00:26.484 --> 00:28.350
Nice.
How'd you know?

00:28.386 --> 00:29.818
I was down the street
when I heard the call

00:29.854 --> 00:31.654
come in over my scanner.

00:31.689 --> 00:33.188
What the hell are you two doing out here?
We were out here

00:33.224 --> 00:34.490
practicing our 50-50's,

00:34.525 --> 00:35.724
and we just found this guy

00:35.760 --> 00:38.394
lying here all dead and stuff.
Nice!

00:38.429 --> 00:40.129
Well, you guys can
get back to your skating.

00:40.164 --> 00:41.497
I got this. Thanks.

00:41.532 --> 00:42.965
Why are you filming him?

00:43.000 --> 00:44.934
You some kind of
freak or something?

00:44.969 --> 00:46.335
I'm a news stringer, man.

00:46.370 --> 00:48.404
I-I videotape crime scenes
for a living.

00:48.439 --> 00:49.672
People pay you for this?

00:49.707 --> 00:51.340
How much?
Uh, something like this,

00:51.375 --> 00:53.175
depending
on the news organization,

00:53.210 --> 00:54.944
I might get, like,
$300 or $400.

00:54.979 --> 00:56.078
Hey, we're the ones
who found this body.

00:56.113 --> 00:57.146
We should be
the ones getting paid.

00:57.181 --> 00:58.414
Hey, how much
do they pay

00:58.449 --> 01:00.082
for an extreme close-up?
Come on!

01:00.117 --> 01:01.884
You're ruining my...
Stop. Stop. Come on.

01:01.919 --> 01:03.953
Whoa, whoa.
Please, just get...

01:03.988 --> 01:04.920
(siren whoops)

01:04.956 --> 01:06.422
(younger guys laugh)

01:06.457 --> 01:08.791
Great!
Yeah, now the cops are here.

01:19.103 --> 01:21.370
Yeah, got it.
Yeah, that was Aubrey.

01:21.405 --> 01:23.339
There was a body found
in Columbia Heights.

01:23.374 --> 01:25.641
So does this mean
you'll be missing date night?

01:25.676 --> 01:27.610
Nah, Aubrey can take
care of himself.

01:27.645 --> 01:29.511
Besides, I don't want
to miss that whore sauce.

01:29.547 --> 01:31.280
Will you please stop referring

01:31.315 --> 01:33.349
to the puttanesca
as "whore sauce."

01:33.384 --> 01:34.783
I'm sorry but does (doorbell rings)
"puttanesca" not mean

01:34.819 --> 01:37.286
"in the style of the
whore" in Italian?

01:37.321 --> 01:38.721
Yeah, it does,
and every time I make it,

01:38.756 --> 01:42.024
I regret having told you that.
Whore sauce.

01:42.059 --> 01:43.692
Hi.
Hi. Aw.

01:43.728 --> 01:46.295
Looks like I'll be representing
the Hodgins clan alone tonight.

01:46.330 --> 01:48.330
Oh, Hodgins was called
out to the scene

01:48.366 --> 01:50.399
at Columbia Heights,
I presume?

01:50.434 --> 01:52.401
Yeah. I guess that means
there'll be more wine for us.

01:52.436 --> 01:53.869
Tell you what.
We'll send home

01:53.904 --> 01:55.304
a doggie bag for bug boy.

01:55.339 --> 01:56.805
Ooh, it smells good.

01:56.841 --> 01:59.041
Oh, look at that!

01:59.076 --> 02:02.411
Okay, that's the sweetest thing
I've ever seen.

02:02.446 --> 02:04.647
Christine really loves
her baby brother, huh?

02:04.682 --> 02:06.482
Yeah, for now. Check back
in ten or 12 years.

02:06.517 --> 02:09.018
Have you had any luck convincing
Hodgins to have another baby?

02:09.053 --> 02:12.488
No. I think he's pretty happy
with the way things are.

02:12.523 --> 02:15.124
And I guess I am, too.

02:15.159 --> 02:17.002
I'm just worried that Michael
Vincent's gonna get lonely.

02:17.026 --> 02:18.094
BOOTH: Worried?

02:18.095 --> 02:20.095
Come on, I've seen that
kid play down at the park.

02:20.131 --> 02:21.597
He's got a bigger entourage
than Floyd Mayweather.

02:21.632 --> 02:22.998
BRENNAN:
And even if

02:23.034 --> 02:24.967
he were lonely,
studies show

02:25.002 --> 02:27.302
that having sufficient
time alone is

02:27.338 --> 02:28.737
extremely beneficial
to the development

02:28.773 --> 02:30.406
of a child's imagination.

02:30.441 --> 02:31.907
Fine. Well, then, maybe

02:31.942 --> 02:35.744
he'll create some
imaginary siblings for himself.

02:35.780 --> 02:37.680
Do you know where
the opener is?

02:37.715 --> 02:39.848
No, but the whore
sauce is burning.

02:41.085 --> 02:44.586
(indistinct police radio
communication)

02:44.622 --> 02:46.455
AUBREY:
Okay. Excuse me.

02:46.490 --> 02:47.923
This is the body
of a human being.

02:47.958 --> 02:49.291
Want to have a little respect,
please?

02:49.326 --> 02:50.893
Tell you what. Can we, uh,

02:50.928 --> 02:53.228
go ahead and push that perimeter
back another ten yards?

02:53.264 --> 02:54.930
Oh, boy. So...

02:54.965 --> 02:57.433
what do my beautiful-brained
colleagues have for me tonight?

02:57.468 --> 02:58.901
HODGINS:
Might want to watch the way

02:58.936 --> 03:00.469
you talk about Cam's brain
there, Aubrey.

03:00.504 --> 03:01.904
Wouldn't want her man
overhearing.

03:01.939 --> 03:04.206
Oh, the, uh, photojournalist?

03:04.241 --> 03:06.775
His name is Sebastian,
and he's not my man.

03:06.811 --> 03:09.144
That's not what the smile
on your face is saying.

03:09.180 --> 03:11.947
The smile on my face is saying
"Mind your own business."

03:11.982 --> 03:13.315
(Hodgins chuckling)

03:13.350 --> 03:14.917
What about the victim's face?

03:14.952 --> 03:16.985
What's their face saying?
SAROYAN: Uh, not much.

03:17.021 --> 03:20.289
Looks like scavengers ate
through most of it, but...

03:20.324 --> 03:23.559
the height of the pinna and
length of the lobule suggest

03:23.594 --> 03:26.829
the victim was a male
in his mid- to late-40s.

03:26.864 --> 03:29.031
You got all that
off half an ear?

03:29.066 --> 03:31.967
I guess you could call me
the ear whisperer.

03:32.002 --> 03:34.403
Ooh-- sorry to interrupt your
clever turn of phrase there,

03:34.438 --> 03:36.572
but something's not right
underneath this guy's shirt.

03:36.607 --> 03:38.307
It's like
he's sucking in his gut.

03:38.342 --> 03:40.743
Okay.

03:43.681 --> 03:47.249
Okay, that does <i> not</i>
look natural.

03:47.284 --> 03:49.418
SAROYAN:
Ooh. Wow.

03:49.453 --> 03:52.221
I'm gonna call the lab and
tell them to prep the platform.

03:52.256 --> 03:54.389
According to this
little maggot mosh-pit,

03:54.425 --> 03:56.959
this guy's been dead
for two days.

03:56.994 --> 03:58.527
This is a high
traffic area.

03:58.562 --> 04:00.462
I mean, people come in
and out of this lot all day.

04:00.498 --> 04:02.131
Which means there's no way

04:02.166 --> 04:05.367
that this guy would go unnoticed
for two entire days.

04:05.402 --> 04:06.835
Someone dropped him here.

04:06.871 --> 04:09.171
They wanted us
to find this body.

04:09.206 --> 04:11.774

I-I saw them rushing him
into surgery.

06:39.926 --> 06:41.626
It didn't look good.

06:44.530 --> 06:46.564
He pulled me out of the way.

06:46.599 --> 06:49.100
He used his body

No way, Angie, no.

06:59.345 --> 07:01.445
Not while the son of a bitch is
still out there that did this.

07:01.481 --> 07:03.014
Hodgins is right. This guy just
blew up a bunch of cops.

07:03.049 --> 07:04.582
He's gonna pay for what he did.

The jagged bone fragments
positioned outwardly suggests

08:53.426 --> 08:55.159
the blast originated

08:55.194 --> 08:57.628
from within the
victim's rib cage.

Well, that's certainly not the

Placing the bomb in this man's
chest was not about ease.

09:02.902 --> 09:04.135
It was about efficiency.

09:04.170 --> 09:06.704
So, the killer wanted
to use the ribs as shrapnel.

09:09.675 --> 09:11.208
Angela,

09:11.244 --> 09:13.010
are all those
photographs necessary?

09:23.556 --> 09:25.756
You almost lost

I just don't get it.

Hi.
Hi.

09:41.274 --> 09:44.108
I saw what happened
on the news.

09:44.143 --> 09:46.477
Cam, are you okay?
I'm fine.

09:46.512 --> 09:48.446
I didn't know you were in town.

09:48.481 --> 09:50.748
I wasn't, but I came

09:50.783 --> 09:52.516
Well, thank you
for your concern,

09:52.552 --> 09:54.051
but like I said, I'm fine.

09:54.087 --> 09:55.753
Perhaps I can help.
That's very kind of you,

09:55.788 --> 09:57.721
but we're okay.
BRENNAN: Well, actually, I've been

09:57.757 --> 09:59.590
so focused on these remains,

09:59.625 --> 10:01.725
I've forgotten
to call in an intern.

10:01.761 --> 10:03.527
I don't think
Arastoo wants to go back

10:03.563 --> 10:05.096
to being your intern,
Dr. Brennan.

10:05.131 --> 10:07.164
He wouldn't be.
He'd be my consultant.

10:07.200 --> 10:08.666
I'll be whatever
you need me to be.

10:08.701 --> 10:10.067
I would just like to help.

10:12.071 --> 10:14.972
Angela, can you please

10:15.007 --> 10:17.274

10:19.912 --> 10:22.413
(electronic whirring, beeping)

10:27.286 --> 10:29.954

Yeah, it's just...

10:29.989 --> 10:31.922
it looks like something's
glimmering on the lateral

10:31.958 --> 10:35.192
aspect of the victim's
right distal femur.

10:35.228 --> 10:36.794
BRENNAN:
Dr. Vaziri is correct.

10:36.829 --> 10:38.529
The victim has
an artificial knee.

10:38.564 --> 10:40.464
The serial number
on it should be able

10:40.500 --> 10:41.866

Aubrey's condition?

he's still in surgery.

10:55.047 --> 10:57.281
That's not good, is it?
Well, it ain't great.

10:57.316 --> 11:00.451
(sighs) I swear I'm gonna catch
the guy who did this.

11:00.486 --> 11:02.620
Eh, between Aubrey
and the four dead cops,

11:02.655 --> 11:05.389
I'm sitting on a mountain of hell.
Yeah, well, your mountain

11:05.424 --> 11:06.957
just got a little bit bigger.

11:06.993 --> 11:08.893
The lab's got an I.D.
on the initial victim.

11:08.928 --> 11:11.228
His name is Thomas Gallo. DCPD.

11:12.298 --> 11:14.131
So a cop was killed,
and his body

11:14.167 --> 11:16.667
was then used
to blow up more cops.

11:16.702 --> 11:18.135
The killer obviously
has an issue with police.

11:18.171 --> 11:19.537
I know a
behavioral analyst

11:19.572 --> 11:23.707
down at the BRIU who specializes
in these types of cases.

11:23.743 --> 11:25.709
I'll have her down here
first thing in the morning.

11:25.745 --> 11:26.677
All right, fine.

11:26.712 --> 11:27.978
Do whatever you need to do.

11:28.014 --> 11:31.582
I will. And right now,
that means saying a prayer

11:31.617 --> 11:33.717
for your scrawny little partner.

11:33.753 --> 11:35.886
(sighs heavily)

11:40.526 --> 11:42.860
Hey. I finished going through
Gallo's clothing,

11:42.895 --> 11:45.162
which was covered
in asbestos fibers.

11:45.198 --> 11:49.733
Hmm. The piece of lung
I examined didn't contain any.

11:49.769 --> 11:52.002
Really? Which means
Gallo was already dead

11:52.038 --> 11:53.938
by the time
he was exposed to it.

11:53.973 --> 11:57.007
So, maybe we can use
the asbestos to pinpoint

11:57.043 --> 11:59.610
where the killer took Gallo's
body to plant that bomb.

11:59.645 --> 12:01.011
Unfortunately, the
presence of asbestos

12:01.047 --> 12:02.613
still isn't as rare
as it should be.

12:02.648 --> 12:04.048
But, you know what?
I'm gonna find us something

12:04.083 --> 12:05.082
that'll help narrow it down.

12:05.117 --> 12:07.218
I know you will.

12:08.588 --> 12:11.855
I imagine this has to be
pretty difficult for you.

12:11.891 --> 12:13.557
If you're referring
to the fact that

12:13.593 --> 12:15.759
I've got the bodies
of four dead police officers

12:15.795 --> 12:19.196
in front of me, then yes,
it <i> is</i> extremely difficult.

12:19.232 --> 12:21.131
Yes, and if I were also
referring to the fact

12:21.167 --> 12:22.733
that your ex-boyfriend
were back at the lab?

12:22.768 --> 12:24.335
Then I don't want
to talk about it.

12:24.370 --> 12:25.269
So I take it that means Arastoo

12:25.304 --> 12:26.804
doesn't know about Sebastian?

12:26.839 --> 12:30.140
The last time I saw or spoke to
Arastoo was the night he quit.

12:30.176 --> 12:32.743
That was... months ago,
Dr. Hodgins.

12:32.778 --> 12:34.044
And yet the minute
he heard what happened,

12:34.080 --> 12:36.146
he dropped everything to
come rushing down here.

12:36.182 --> 12:38.449
It's obvious Arastoo
still cares about you.

12:38.484 --> 12:39.950
And I still care about him,

12:39.986 --> 12:42.953
but right now I care more
about catching a cop killer.

12:44.890 --> 12:46.557
Is there anything else?

12:55.301 --> 12:56.934
(knocking)
Yeah.

12:56.969 --> 12:58.836
Hi. Hey! I am so sorry I'm late.

12:58.871 --> 13:00.938
Actually, you know what,
I was here on time,

13:00.973 --> 13:02.306
but I was going through
security and I realized

13:02.341 --> 13:03.807
that I forgot my badge
at home, so I had

13:03.843 --> 13:06.110
to drive home, grab my badge,
and just floor it to get back.

13:06.145 --> 13:08.512
I mean, I didn't
floor it, you know...

13:08.547 --> 13:10.848
I drove the speed limit.
Who are you?

13:10.883 --> 13:12.650
Oh, God. You are
Agent Booth, aren't you?

13:12.685 --> 13:14.451
Oh, no, am I
in the wrong office?

13:14.487 --> 13:15.986
No, no, no, you're
in the right office.

13:16.022 --> 13:17.221
Yeah, I'm-I'm Special
Agent Seeley Booth.

13:17.256 --> 13:18.889
But I'm on my way
into an interview.

13:18.924 --> 13:20.057
Something I can
help you with?

13:20.092 --> 13:21.925
Um, I'm-I'm Karen Delfs.

13:22.928 --> 13:24.161
From the BRIU.

13:24.196 --> 13:25.562
The behavioral analyst.

13:25.598 --> 13:28.132
Yeah. Which means
I'm usually pretty good

13:28.167 --> 13:31.035
at picking up when somebody
is upset about something.

13:31.070 --> 13:32.803
Look, I'm so sorry
I forgot my badge,

13:32.838 --> 13:34.872
but the only reason I did it is
because I've been so hyper-focused

13:34.907 --> 13:36.240
on studying up
on this case.

13:36.275 --> 13:37.641
Look, I'm not upset at you.

13:37.677 --> 13:39.009
I don't even
know who you are.

13:39.045 --> 13:41.945
I'm upset because somebody
tried to blow up my friend.

13:41.981 --> 13:43.347
Right. I'm so sorry.
Agent James Aubrey.

13:43.382 --> 13:45.416
Yes. Aubrey.

13:45.451 --> 13:47.518
So, you've been studying this case?
Yes.

13:47.553 --> 13:48.686
Is there anything that
you can give me

13:48.721 --> 13:50.421
to help me find the killer?

13:50.456 --> 13:52.056
Absolutely.
I think that the fact

13:52.091 --> 13:53.657
that the initial
victim was a cop

13:53.693 --> 13:55.259
speaks to a level
of sophistication

13:55.294 --> 13:56.593
on the killer's part.
I mean,

13:56.629 --> 13:59.063
killing a cop takes a lot of
planning and organization.

13:59.098 --> 14:01.565
Right. Which means more likely
that he's killed before.

14:01.600 --> 14:04.902
I also think that there was a reason that
Officer Gallo was targeted specifically.

14:04.937 --> 14:06.337
See, we find <i> that</i> reason,

14:06.372 --> 14:08.772
and maybe we find our killer.
That's amazing.

14:08.808 --> 14:10.381
You drove all the way down
here twice just to tell me

14:10.405 --> 14:11.962
something that I already know.

14:12.712 --> 14:15.079
Apparently, I did.
You did.

14:15.114 --> 14:16.814
But thank you.

14:16.849 --> 14:18.582
You're... welcome.

14:18.617 --> 14:20.351
Great. Thanks, Lieutenant
for coming in.

14:20.386 --> 14:22.186
Can you have a seat?
Yeah, sure.

14:22.221 --> 14:25.489
So, you are the head
of the DCPD gang unit,

14:25.524 --> 14:27.358
is that correct?
Yeah, it is.

14:27.393 --> 14:28.826
Gallo was one of my guys.

14:28.861 --> 14:30.994
Been with my crew
for the past ten years.

14:31.030 --> 14:32.529
We have reason
to believe that

14:32.565 --> 14:35.666
Officer Gallo was targeted
specifically.

14:35.701 --> 14:37.401
So you have
some suspects in mind?

14:37.436 --> 14:38.969
<i>La Serpiente.</i>

14:39.004 --> 14:41.605
They're an El Salvadoran
gun-running outfit.

14:41.640 --> 14:42.973
Yeah, I'm familiar with them.

14:43.008 --> 14:44.141
That's a pretty serious
organization.

14:44.176 --> 14:45.676
Yeah, and we
haven't been able

14:45.711 --> 14:47.277
to nail them on
anything substantial.

14:47.313 --> 14:49.179
So we've been attempting
to dismantle the gang

14:49.215 --> 14:51.215
by pestering them
with minor violations.

14:51.250 --> 14:52.883
Speeding, jaywalking,
that sort of thing.

14:52.918 --> 14:54.785
So you're saying
that Gallo was targeted

14:54.820 --> 14:57.421
because he was passing out
jaywalking tickets?

14:57.456 --> 15:00.557
Four days ago, Gallo pulled over
the head of <i> La Serpiente</i>

15:00.593 --> 15:02.126
for a broken taillight.

15:02.161 --> 15:04.962
Searched the car-- found
an unregistered .44.

15:04.997 --> 15:07.097
It was the guy's
third strike.

15:07.133 --> 15:08.565
Four days ago.

15:08.601 --> 15:10.701
That was the day
<i>before</i> Gallo was killed.

15:10.736 --> 15:12.369
Yeah, it was a big bust.

15:12.405 --> 15:14.204
Made the local news
and everything.

15:14.240 --> 15:16.206
Gallo went out that
night to celebrate.

15:16.242 --> 15:18.075
Where?
Cop bar called Morty's.

15:18.110 --> 15:20.177
He was last seen leaving there
about 1:30 in the morning.

15:20.212 --> 15:21.545
So you've been looking
into this already.

15:21.580 --> 15:23.180
Well, when Gallo
went missing,

15:23.215 --> 15:25.582
I started to have my suspicions,
but without a body,

15:25.618 --> 15:27.851
I couldn't get very far.
Well, do me a favor,

15:27.887 --> 15:29.086
next time
you have your suspicions

15:29.121 --> 15:30.654
make sure you run 'em by <i> me.</i>

15:30.689 --> 15:32.289
I'm head of this case now.

15:36.286 --> 15:37.806
(door opens)
CAROLINE: Julian Molina.

15:40.065 --> 15:42.582
Says here you're
the right hand

15:42.583 --> 15:44.650
to the leader
of <i> La Serpiente.</i>

15:44.685 --> 15:47.219
If that's what your
little piece of paper tells you,

15:47.255 --> 15:48.554
it must be true.

15:48.589 --> 15:50.723
It also tells me,
within the past month,

15:50.758 --> 15:52.558
you received two
parking violations

15:52.593 --> 15:54.326
and a citation
for littering.

15:54.362 --> 15:58.631
All that pestering by the DCPD
must have pissed you off.

15:58.666 --> 16:01.300
I must have been careless
with my bubble gum wrappers.

16:01.335 --> 16:04.236
I can't fault the boys in blue
for doing their job.

16:04.272 --> 16:05.838
Not even when that job

16:05.873 --> 16:09.041
means taking down your boss
on weapons charges?

16:09.076 --> 16:10.976
(laughs): Is that
what this is about?

16:11.012 --> 16:14.013
You think I had something
to do with bomb boy?

16:14.048 --> 16:15.681
"Bomb boy" was the cop

16:15.716 --> 16:18.050
responsible
for the big man's arrest.

16:18.085 --> 16:20.319
So I blew him up, huh?
Then used his body

16:20.354 --> 16:23.022
to send a message to the force
to back off.

16:23.057 --> 16:26.091
My boss is
a very smart man.

16:26.127 --> 16:27.726
He's certainly
not the type

16:27.762 --> 16:31.197
to leave an unregistered
weapon in his vehicle.

16:32.233 --> 16:34.366
If you know what I'm saying.

16:34.402 --> 16:37.236
Yeah.
What your sorry behind is saying

16:37.271 --> 16:39.471
is that you planted the gun.

16:39.507 --> 16:40.639
Who, me? No.

16:40.675 --> 16:42.274
(laughs)

16:42.310 --> 16:44.076
With your boss out of the way,

16:44.111 --> 16:46.745
you're in prime position
to take over the gang.

16:46.781 --> 16:48.447
Well, if that were true,

16:48.482 --> 16:50.216
I'd owe it all to bomb boy.

16:50.251 --> 16:51.784
Do you really think I would kill

16:51.819 --> 16:54.186
the cop responsible for my promotion?
Well...

16:54.222 --> 16:57.556
clearly, loyalty
isn't <i> your</i> strong suit.

17:06.400 --> 17:07.933
(chuckles):
Hey.

17:07.969 --> 17:09.935
There he is.

17:09.971 --> 17:12.338
Welcome back.

17:12.373 --> 17:14.205
Were you guys
just watching me sleep?

17:14.242 --> 17:16.407
CAROLINE: Apparently,
we're not the only ones.

17:16.444 --> 17:18.109
According to the visitors log,

17:18.145 --> 17:21.180
Jessica Warren's
already been by twice.

17:21.214 --> 17:23.781
Ladies love a hero, huh?

17:23.818 --> 17:26.185
I'd smile,
but I'm in too much pain.

17:26.220 --> 17:30.222
I feel like I got hit
by a truck carrying more trucks.

17:30.258 --> 17:33.092
Doctors pulled seven pieces
of shrapnel

17:33.127 --> 17:35.361
out of that bony
little body of yours.

17:35.396 --> 17:37.897
Luckily, none of them hit
any arteries or vital organs.

17:37.932 --> 17:39.398
HODGINS: Brother, if I could
take any of that pain

17:39.433 --> 17:42.067
off your hands,
I would do it in a heartbeat.

17:42.103 --> 17:44.470
I owe you big-time.

17:44.505 --> 17:46.772
How's everybody else?

17:49.644 --> 17:52.111
It was a rough night,<i> Cher.</i>

18:01.689 --> 18:03.422
Morning, Dr. Brennan.

18:03.457 --> 18:05.624
You'll be happy to know
that I've already cleaned,

18:05.660 --> 18:08.327
separated, and rearticulated the
remains, as much as possible.

18:08.362 --> 18:10.062
Excellent work,
Dr. Vaziri.

18:10.097 --> 18:12.998
And I'm nearly finished with
the reconstruction of the skull.

18:13.034 --> 18:16.368
I must say I wasn't expecting
you back in the lab today.

18:16.404 --> 18:18.437
I told you, I wanted
to help catch the killer.

18:18.472 --> 18:20.339
I plan on being here
until that happens.

18:20.374 --> 18:22.541
And you've cleared this
with your new employers?

18:22.576 --> 18:25.311
Actually,
I don't have an employer.

18:25.346 --> 18:27.546
Oh. You've gone
into the private sector?

18:27.581 --> 18:30.316
I haven't gone into any sector.

18:30.351 --> 18:32.751
Things have been
pretty tough for me

18:32.787 --> 18:35.154
since leaving the Jeffersonian.

18:37.191 --> 18:38.557
I'm sorry to hear that.

18:38.592 --> 18:40.092
So, what have you
discovered

18:40.127 --> 18:43.662
from your reconstruction
of the victim's skull?

18:43.698 --> 18:45.664
Evidence of
projectile trauma

18:45.700 --> 18:47.633
on the parietal,
near the lamdoidal suture.

18:47.668 --> 18:49.234
The projectile exited
through the glabella.

18:49.270 --> 18:51.070
Judging by the size
of the wound,

18:51.105 --> 18:53.105
this was created
by a small-caliber weapon.

18:53.106 --> 18:54.778
And the presence of gunshot
residue says

18:54.802 --> 18:56.517
the weapon was
fired from close range.

18:57.545 --> 18:59.411
Cause of death appears
to be consistent

18:59.447 --> 19:00.946
with a gangland
assassination.

19:00.982 --> 19:02.815
And further evidence pointing
toward <i> La Serpiente.</i>

19:02.850 --> 19:05.651
I hate to rain on your parade,
but I just finished analyzing

19:05.686 --> 19:07.820
the shrapnel Cam pulled
from the deceased officers.

19:07.855 --> 19:09.088
Were you able to determine

19:09.123 --> 19:10.522
the type of device used
in the attack?

19:10.558 --> 19:12.691
The bomb was made of steel,
and it was loaded

19:12.727 --> 19:14.560
with black powder
and match heads.

19:14.595 --> 19:16.428
A pipe bomb?
Yeah, exactly. I mean, this is

19:16.464 --> 19:18.163
Bomb-Making 101.
And not at all consistent

19:18.199 --> 19:19.832
with the type of bomb

19:19.867 --> 19:22.434
a sophisticated operation
like <i> La Serpiente</i> would use.

19:22.470 --> 19:25.838
Unfortunately, no, it's not.

19:32.046 --> 19:35.247
MONTENEGRO: So, DCPD uses
a system known as ShotSpotter.

19:35.282 --> 19:36.849
The red dots

19:36.884 --> 19:39.618
indicate the location
of the gunshots

19:39.653 --> 19:41.387
heard three nights ago.

19:41.422 --> 19:44.356
Well, the victim was last seen
leaving Morty's bar at 1:30,

19:44.392 --> 19:46.892
so we can lose all the
gunfire prior to that.

19:46.927 --> 19:49.361
MONTENEGRO: As well as where
the arrests were made.

19:49.397 --> 19:50.754
SAROYAN:
That leaves us with two.

19:50.755 --> 19:51.885
Hopefully not after

19:51.909 --> 19:54.991
I run the gunshots through
the sound-forging software.

19:56.670 --> 19:58.937
Now we just plot the decibels

19:58.973 --> 20:01.373
as a function of frequency.

20:01.409 --> 20:04.143
And what exactly are we watching for?
The frequencies

20:04.178 --> 20:06.378
at which the two
gunshots came in.

20:06.414 --> 20:09.681
Small-caliber firearms
tend to have higher decibels,

20:09.717 --> 20:12.217
but not so much
in the lower frequencies.

20:12.253 --> 20:14.053
(recorded gunshots)

20:15.156 --> 20:17.122
So the fact that
the first shot had

20:17.158 --> 20:19.324
a higher decibel
in the lower frequency

20:19.360 --> 20:21.660
means it came
from a large-caliber weapon?

20:21.695 --> 20:25.230
And since our victim was shot
with a small-caliber gun...

20:25.266 --> 20:27.266
SAROYAN:
Means we found

20:27.301 --> 20:28.934
where the victim was murdered.

20:33.040 --> 20:34.740
ShotSpotter's accurate
up to ten feet,

20:34.775 --> 20:37.576
so the murder had to have taken
place somewhere around here.

20:37.611 --> 20:40.479
Well, dark alley--
plenty of cover. I hate to say it,

20:40.514 --> 20:42.214
but this is
the perfect place to ambush

20:42.249 --> 20:44.450
a drunk cop on his way home
after the bar.

20:44.485 --> 20:46.051
SAROYAN: Well, Booth is
contacting nearby businesses.

20:46.087 --> 20:49.354
Hopefully, someone will
remember seeing something.

20:49.390 --> 20:51.490
Look.

20:51.525 --> 20:53.792
There is blood speckled
all over this wall.

20:53.828 --> 20:57.196
All right, well, we know
that the victim was shot

20:57.231 --> 20:58.764
at point-blank range,
so I'm hoping

20:58.799 --> 21:02.101
that maybe
we'll be able to find...

21:04.772 --> 21:06.004
Bingo.

21:06.040 --> 21:07.639
Bullet casing.

21:07.675 --> 21:09.608
From a small-caliber pistol,

21:09.643 --> 21:11.143
just like the one used
to kill Gallo.

21:11.178 --> 21:12.344
Okay. All right.

21:12.379 --> 21:13.479
When I head back to the lab,

21:13.514 --> 21:16.115
I'm gonna see if I can
actually sw-- (groaning)

21:16.150 --> 21:18.350
You okay?
Uh, yeah.

21:18.385 --> 21:20.319
(phone ringing)
Just remind me not to, uh,

21:20.354 --> 21:22.955
stand near any more
exploding bodies, huh?

21:22.990 --> 21:25.958
(sighs)

21:25.993 --> 21:29.128
Okay, Booth says
that a busboy

21:29.163 --> 21:31.163
from a nearby restaurant
remembers seeing

21:31.198 --> 21:33.332
a bright orange
Mustang out here

21:33.367 --> 21:35.033
around the time
of the shooting.

21:35.069 --> 21:35.968
Wait a second.

21:36.003 --> 21:37.069
There was
a bright orange Mustang

21:37.104 --> 21:38.237
at the crime scene yesterday.

21:38.272 --> 21:41.140
Yeah, I'm guessing
that's no coincidence.

21:43.685 --> 21:44.917
BOOTH:
<i>So, Seth, I've been talking</i>

21:44.953 --> 21:46.419
to my friends over at the DCPD.

21:46.454 --> 21:47.987
Turns out that
you've made a lot of enemies

21:48.023 --> 21:49.655
inside the department.

21:49.691 --> 21:50.757
So?

21:50.792 --> 21:53.359
Fewer cards to send
out at Christmas.

21:53.395 --> 21:55.361
Why do you hate cops so much?
No, man.

21:55.397 --> 21:56.996
I'm not biting. I've been around
enough crime scenes

21:57.032 --> 21:58.264
to know how you guys work.

21:58.299 --> 21:59.732
Have you been around

21:59.768 --> 22:02.068
so many crime scenes because
you're the one who made them?

22:02.103 --> 22:03.436
Are you kidding me?

22:03.471 --> 22:05.605
Look, I'm around
so many crime scenes

22:05.640 --> 22:07.340
because I'm good
at my job, okay?

22:07.375 --> 22:08.708
I-I know which neighborhoods
to hang around.

22:08.743 --> 22:09.783
Okay, look, you know what,

22:09.811 --> 22:11.878
we can place you
at the alley where Gallo...

22:11.913 --> 22:13.813
(whispering): Sorry. Keep going.
...was killed

22:13.848 --> 22:15.181
Keep going.
...three nights ago.

22:15.216 --> 22:16.849
I-I intercepted a call

22:16.885 --> 22:18.785
about a possible shooting,
but when I got to the alley

22:18.820 --> 22:21.421
there was nothing there,
so I left-- I swear.

22:21.456 --> 22:22.688
All right, well,
we'll see about that.

22:22.724 --> 22:24.290
Look at these. Hmm?
SETH: Is this my work?

22:24.325 --> 22:25.792
I-I never gave you guys

22:25.827 --> 22:27.360
my camera,
so how'd you get these images?

22:27.395 --> 22:29.228
Oh, I didn't get these from you.
I got them

22:29.264 --> 22:31.330
from the news organizations that
you've been selling them to.

22:31.366 --> 22:32.932
Which is, again, why I'm late.
And I'm so sorry.

22:32.967 --> 22:34.000
Shh, shh. Wow, look,

22:34.035 --> 22:35.601
these really are gruesome,
aren't they?

22:35.637 --> 22:37.003
Mm-hmm. Mr. Dirklin
seems to be

22:37.038 --> 22:39.472
very comfortable
around death and gore.

22:39.507 --> 22:42.842
In fact, his work seems
to be completely devoid of any emotion.

22:42.877 --> 22:44.410
To be a successful
news stringer, you need

22:44.446 --> 22:47.413
to be able to detach yourself
from the job. That's all I'm doing.

22:47.449 --> 22:49.715
Also, to commit a series of
heinous crimes simply as a means

22:49.751 --> 22:52.051
of making money, you would
need a certain level of detachment.

22:52.087 --> 22:54.387
Right. Your footage
of the bomb going off

22:54.422 --> 22:55.888
is being played
across the country.

22:55.924 --> 22:57.090
And every time it gets played,

22:57.125 --> 22:58.658
you're getting paid.

22:58.693 --> 23:00.993
Right?
So he must be the only one

23:01.029 --> 23:02.462
who's profiting
from these crimes.

23:02.497 --> 23:05.498
That does not look good for you.

23:05.533 --> 23:06.866
Mm-mm.

23:13.208 --> 23:14.307
Creepy! This looks like

23:14.342 --> 23:16.442
one of those found-footage
horror films.

23:16.478 --> 23:19.445
Yeah, except this is real life.
This is footage

23:19.481 --> 23:22.515
Dirklin took in the alley on the
night that Gallo was murdered.

23:22.550 --> 23:24.550
What's going on?
Um...

23:24.586 --> 23:25.952
can you stop what you're
doing for a second?

23:25.987 --> 23:27.253
Yeah.

23:27.288 --> 23:30.256
I came to tell you that...

23:30.291 --> 23:31.691
I'm ready.

23:31.726 --> 23:33.092
Ready? Ready for what?

23:33.128 --> 23:34.627
To have another baby.

23:34.662 --> 23:36.162
Or two.

23:36.197 --> 23:38.865
Or... seven.

23:38.900 --> 23:41.601
As many curly-headed
little ones as you want.

23:41.636 --> 23:44.070
But I thought...
I thought you said, um,

23:44.105 --> 23:46.439
you were comfortable
with what we have.

23:46.474 --> 23:49.742
I know I did. I know, Angie, but
after what happened yesterday,

23:49.777 --> 23:52.145
I realized that
there's still so much in life

23:52.180 --> 23:54.547
I want to experience with you,
you know? And I...

23:54.582 --> 23:57.383
I don't want to die.
I-I want to keep growing.

23:57.418 --> 23:58.918
The only way for me to do that

23:58.953 --> 24:00.586
is to get out
of my comfort zone.

24:00.622 --> 24:04.891
Well, yeah,
let's... let's keep growing.

24:04.926 --> 24:07.627
Yeah? (chuckles): Good.
(chuckles)

24:09.831 --> 24:13.833
But let's catch
this killer first.

24:13.868 --> 24:15.468
Wait, I thought
that Booth said

24:15.503 --> 24:18.037
that the crime scene
videographer was looking good for it.

24:18.072 --> 24:20.106
Well, he was, but
then I looked

24:20.141 --> 24:22.542
through all the footage,
and there's nothing there.

24:22.577 --> 24:25.945
Yeah, but he could've shot this
while he was waiting for the victim

24:25.980 --> 24:28.181
to leave the bar and make
his way down the alley.

24:28.216 --> 24:29.849
Hey, there's something
back there.

24:29.884 --> 24:33.152
Behind the Dumpster.
Like a rat?

24:33.188 --> 24:35.688
Give me a second.

24:40.195 --> 24:42.028
No, it's a human being
standing over

24:42.063 --> 24:43.629
a dead body.
Dirklin

24:43.665 --> 24:45.164
caught the killer on camera,

24:45.200 --> 24:46.666
and he-he didn't
even know it.

24:46.701 --> 24:48.968
Which unfortunately means
it isn't Dirklin.

24:49.003 --> 24:51.370
Our killer's still out there.

24:56.511 --> 24:58.811
Upon completion
of the thoracic area,

24:58.846 --> 25:01.147
I discovered sharp force trauma
on the body of the sternum,

25:01.182 --> 25:04.617
as well as the left and right
side ribs, three through six.

25:04.652 --> 25:07.186
Lack of hemorrhagic staining
suggests

25:07.222 --> 25:09.388
these are postmortem injuries.
The trauma

25:09.424 --> 25:12.325
is also inconsistent with the damage
sustained during the explosion.

25:12.360 --> 25:13.993
The killer must have broken
these bones

25:14.028 --> 25:16.829
to plant the bomb
in the rib cage.

25:16.864 --> 25:18.664
If we can determine
the implement used

25:18.700 --> 25:22.004
to create these injuries,
it may lead us closer to the killer.

25:22.005 --> 25:24.370
The striae appear
to have variant trajectories.

25:24.405 --> 25:27.340
VAZIRI: One set has a superior
direction, the other inferior.

25:27.375 --> 25:29.375
Which is suggestive
of some sort

25:29.410 --> 25:31.210
of extremely powerful
shearing tool.

25:31.246 --> 25:33.446
Have Dr. Hodgins swab the
wounds for particulates.

25:33.481 --> 25:35.047
SAROYAN: I was able
to recover a print

25:35.083 --> 25:37.250
off the bullet casing
we found in the alley.

25:37.285 --> 25:39.885
Any match on the print?
I got a hit off IAFIS.

25:39.921 --> 25:41.854
It belongs to a man
named Scott Larette.

25:41.889 --> 25:43.022
I'll notify Booth.

25:47.662 --> 25:49.195
(sighs)

25:49.230 --> 25:50.696
Uh, hey.

25:50.732 --> 25:53.266
Hey.

25:54.702 --> 25:57.803
Dr. Brennan said
that you're having difficulties

25:57.839 --> 25:59.305
finding a job.

25:59.340 --> 26:01.540
Oh, I'll find something.

26:03.177 --> 26:04.610
How are things with you?

26:04.646 --> 26:05.878
Oh, good.

26:05.913 --> 26:07.713
Everything's good. Just...

26:07.749 --> 26:09.448
working, you know?

26:09.484 --> 26:12.251
Sure.

26:13.154 --> 26:15.254
I'm sorry. This is weird.

26:15.290 --> 26:17.290
(chuckling):
Yeah, extremely.

26:17.325 --> 26:19.959
I'm gonna... go.

26:19.994 --> 26:22.328
Yeah, yeah. I need
to get back to the bones, so...

26:23.298 --> 26:24.897
Yeah.

26:31.406 --> 26:33.739
AUBREY:
<i>Behavioral analyst?</i>

26:33.775 --> 26:35.708
So you're like a
real-life Clarice Starling?

26:35.743 --> 26:37.777
I never thought about it
like that before.

26:37.812 --> 26:39.445
That is totally true.

26:39.480 --> 26:41.847
All right, enough
of the happy talk.

26:41.883 --> 26:43.616
It's time
to get to work.

26:43.651 --> 26:45.785
Where's Booth?
On his way to pick up Larette.

26:45.820 --> 26:49.488
So, in the meantime,
we're gonna study up.

26:49.524 --> 26:51.257
Here's all we got
on the guy.

26:51.292 --> 26:52.825
Larette's fingerprints
are already in the system

26:52.860 --> 26:55.194
because he'd applied
for a position

26:55.229 --> 26:57.863
with DCPD. Multiple times.

26:57.899 --> 26:59.452
This guy wanted to be a cop?

26:59.476 --> 27:00.667
DELFS: Well, that was
never gonna happen.

27:00.668 --> 27:03.369
I mean, according to his file,
he failed his psychological exam

27:03.404 --> 27:05.137
due to anger issues.

27:05.173 --> 27:06.539
So the cranky little man
had to settle

27:06.574 --> 27:08.307
for part-time work

27:08.343 --> 27:09.975
as a security guard.
You know,

27:10.011 --> 27:11.811
the constant rejection
at the hands of the police

27:11.846 --> 27:14.647
could have certainly fueled
Larette's tendency towards rage.

27:14.682 --> 27:16.816
This must have been his way
of getting back at the force

27:16.851 --> 27:18.284
for rejecting him.
(phone rings)

27:18.319 --> 27:20.119
No luck
at Larette's apartment.

27:20.154 --> 27:24.023
Booth's saying it looks like
he hasn't been home all week.

27:24.058 --> 27:26.659
We got to find this guy
before he strikes again.

27:28.663 --> 27:31.297
Got the results of the swab
to the rib injuries.

27:31.332 --> 27:32.765
Did you find anything
we could use?

27:32.800 --> 27:35.301
There were traces of latex
in the wounds.

27:35.336 --> 27:37.737
Well, the killer probably wore
latex gloves to do the job.

27:37.772 --> 27:39.772
No, if that were the case,
I would've found anti-degradants in it.

27:39.807 --> 27:42.241
Do you mind? So, this was
preprocessed latex.

27:42.276 --> 27:45.378
The only place that you're likely to find
preprocessed latex

27:45.413 --> 27:46.912
is in a processing center.

27:46.948 --> 27:49.775
Wow, there are at least a
half a dozen of these places in town.

27:49.776 --> 27:51.584
Yes, but only one of
them recently shut down

27:51.619 --> 27:54.820
and used asbestos
in their insulation.

27:54.856 --> 27:56.756
And since we found asbestos
on our victim's clothing...

27:56.791 --> 27:58.991
It means that this has got
to be the place the killer

27:59.026 --> 28:01.093
brought Gallo's body
to plant the bomb.

28:14.709 --> 28:16.175
MAN:
Agent Booth.

28:16.210 --> 28:18.477
What do we got?
Got a body over here.

28:18.513 --> 28:20.858
He's wearing a holster.
Think it might be another cop.

28:20.859 --> 28:23.716
Okay, look, everybody back until we get
the bomb squad out here.

28:23.751 --> 28:25.050
(rats squeaking)

28:27.889 --> 28:29.121
Move!

28:33.907 --> 28:36.641
The victim appears to have
suffered a single gunshot

28:36.677 --> 28:38.209
to the frontal bone.

28:38.245 --> 28:40.278
Shot in the head.
Just like our first victim.

28:40.314 --> 28:42.213
Yeah. Who also had a bomb
stuffed into his chest.

28:42.249 --> 28:43.518
So please tell me
someone's checked to make...

28:43.542 --> 28:44.450
No, I can

28:44.451 --> 28:47.385
assure you these remains
are explosive-free.

28:49.489 --> 28:50.755
(phone ringing)

28:50.791 --> 28:51.791
(gasps)

28:52.359 --> 28:55.226
Relax. It's me.

28:55.262 --> 28:57.929
Yeah. Maybe put that on vibrate
next time.

28:57.965 --> 28:59.798
Sorry.

29:03.036 --> 29:04.669
Hey.

29:04.705 --> 29:06.771
Yeah,
I'm fine. I...

29:06.807 --> 29:11.309
I know. I'm sorry. I was at
the lab late last night, and...

29:11.345 --> 29:13.712
Seems a bit unlike Cam
to take a personal call

29:13.747 --> 29:15.547
in the middle of a case
like this.

29:15.582 --> 29:17.649
(sighs)
It's probably just Sebastian.

29:17.684 --> 29:18.750
Who's Sebastian?

29:18.785 --> 29:19.417
Hmm?

29:19.453 --> 29:20.819
Hodgins,

29:20.854 --> 29:22.454
who's Sebastian?

29:22.489 --> 29:23.822
He's... no one.

29:23.857 --> 29:25.190
He's just a guy

29:25.225 --> 29:28.026
who exists in reality.

29:28.061 --> 29:29.527
Are he and Cam dating?

29:29.563 --> 29:30.829
(chuckling):
What?

29:30.864 --> 29:32.330
Why would you...

29:32.366 --> 29:34.099
I mean, how would I...

29:34.134 --> 29:35.300
What makes
you think...

29:35.335 --> 29:36.534
Yeah.

29:36.570 --> 29:39.070
I wouldn't worry
about it, dude.

29:39.106 --> 29:40.905
Seriously, the guy's
not really around that much.

29:40.941 --> 29:42.574
I mean, he's this,
like, photojournalist

29:42.609 --> 29:45.110
who's always off in some,
like, war-torn country.

29:45.145 --> 29:47.479
Which is actually
really impressive. But not...

29:47.514 --> 29:49.681
not as impressive as you.
I mean, you're

29:49.716 --> 29:52.550
totally impressive,
even without a job.

29:52.586 --> 29:54.552
I'm gonna stop talking now.

29:54.588 --> 29:55.954
No, it's great.

29:55.989 --> 29:57.355
I mean, for Cam.

29:57.391 --> 30:00.492
She deserves to be happy.

30:00.527 --> 30:04.262
Based on the posteriorly
slanted frontal bone

30:04.297 --> 30:07.766
and the angular eye orbits, the
victim was a Caucasian male.

30:07.801 --> 30:09.034
How's it looking
for time of death?

30:09.069 --> 30:11.069
Well, according
to the third instar

30:11.104 --> 30:12.871
<i>Sarcophaga haemorrhoidalis</i>
larvae,

30:12.906 --> 30:15.473
this victim's been dead
for about five days.

30:15.509 --> 30:16.908
Meaning this victim was killed
before Gallo.

30:16.943 --> 30:18.276
MONTENEGRO: Hey.

30:18.311 --> 30:20.678
So it looks like Booth
finally found Scott Larette.

30:20.714 --> 30:22.247
That's awesome.
Yeah, nah, it's not that awesome.

30:22.282 --> 30:24.983
According
to my facial reconstruction,

30:25.018 --> 30:27.318
it's the man lying
on this table.

30:31.591 --> 30:33.758
AUBREY:
<i>Wait,</i>

30:33.794 --> 30:34.712
so if Larette wasn't a cop,

30:34.736 --> 30:36.362
then why was he found
wearing a holster?

30:36.363 --> 30:39.831
The owner of the processing plant was
having problems with scrap metal theft

30:39.866 --> 30:41.466
so he hired him on
to work security.

30:41.501 --> 30:43.468
Well, what kind of security
guard carries a gun?

30:43.503 --> 30:46.271
Uh, somebody who wants
to become a cop, you know?

30:46.306 --> 30:48.206
Bottom line is they didn't find
the gun in the holster.

30:48.241 --> 30:49.674
So the killer
must have taken it.

30:49.709 --> 30:51.776
BOOTH: Which would explain
why we found

30:51.812 --> 30:54.846
Larette's prints on the casing
of the bullet that killed Gallo.

30:54.881 --> 30:55.847
DELFS: I could've sworn
I put my phone in my purse

30:55.882 --> 30:56.948
before we left the office.

30:56.983 --> 30:58.116
Karen, do you realize

30:58.151 --> 30:59.517
that we're just figuring
something out right now?

30:59.553 --> 31:01.186
I know, and I want to help.
Look, I was building

31:01.221 --> 31:03.188
a psychological profile
of the killer, and I was storing

31:03.223 --> 31:06.024
the notes on my phone;
I... so I...

31:07.794 --> 31:10.862
Sorry. One second.
Okay. Wow.

31:10.897 --> 31:12.831
Is that a
mousetrap?

31:12.866 --> 31:15.567
Why do you have a mousetrap in your purse?
(chuckles)

31:15.602 --> 31:16.534
I have no idea.

31:16.570 --> 31:17.669
Okay.
I'm just gonna...

31:17.704 --> 31:19.437
That's not weird.
Okay.

31:19.473 --> 31:22.440
Got it. Sorry.
So...

31:22.476 --> 31:25.343
Right. The fact that Gallo
was on TV shortly before

31:25.378 --> 31:27.879
his death suggests
that the killer seeks notoriety.

31:27.914 --> 31:31.549
So the killer wanted to be known
for taking down a hero cop.

31:31.585 --> 31:33.585
Gallo had become a symbol
for good policing,

31:33.620 --> 31:35.920
and our killer wanted
to destroy that symbol.

31:35.956 --> 31:37.655
Wait, Larette
wasn't a cop, okay?

31:37.691 --> 31:38.790
How does he factor in all this?

31:38.825 --> 31:40.225
Well, he may not
have a badge,

31:40.260 --> 31:42.527
but he was walking around
with a gun and a holster.

31:42.562 --> 31:44.929
Both are obvious markers
of authority.

31:44.965 --> 31:46.331
So you're saying
that our killer

31:46.366 --> 31:48.099
doesn't have an issue with
the police specifically...

31:48.135 --> 31:50.835
I'm saying that his problem
is with authority in general.

31:50.871 --> 31:51.870
BOOTH: Which means
we have no idea

31:51.905 --> 31:53.605
who he's going after next.

31:56.510 --> 31:58.843
Dr. Brennan,
there appears to be chipping

31:58.879 --> 32:02.213
at the external edges
of the entry wound.

32:02.249 --> 32:06.284
Oh. This injury is
common in suicides,

32:06.319 --> 32:08.786
where the gun is pressed
against the skull.

32:08.822 --> 32:11.656
The chipping occurs
as a result of recoil.

32:11.691 --> 32:14.459
So, like Gallo, Larette was
also shot from close range

32:14.494 --> 32:15.927
with a small-caliber weapon.

32:15.962 --> 32:18.897
Most likely his own.

32:18.932 --> 32:22.367
Dr. Vaziri, I have come
to the conclusion

32:22.402 --> 32:25.069
I would like to aid in
your effort to find a job.

32:25.105 --> 32:27.772
That's quite all right.
You've already done plenty for me.

32:27.807 --> 32:30.675
I am very well-respected
in my field.

32:30.710 --> 32:31.976
My influence knows no bounds.

32:32.012 --> 32:33.111
I know.

32:33.146 --> 32:34.946
But I think it's time for me
to leave the nest

32:34.981 --> 32:36.548
and learn to fly on my own.

32:36.583 --> 32:39.951
Well, if you ever change
your mind,

32:39.986 --> 32:41.186
I'm here for you.

32:42.255 --> 32:44.389
There appears
to be microfracturing

32:44.424 --> 32:45.723
on the left ulna.

32:47.427 --> 32:49.527
Well, the location
of the fracturing

32:49.563 --> 32:51.696
suggests a defensive wound.

32:51.731 --> 32:54.465
Meaning it wasn't a well-planned
assassination, like with Gallo.

32:54.501 --> 32:56.568
The killer struggled with
Larette before killing him.

32:56.603 --> 32:58.536
And the more they struggled,
the more chance

32:58.572 --> 33:01.206
the killer left behind something
that could point back to him.

33:04.778 --> 33:06.811
BRENNAN:
<i>Booth, I got your text.</i>

33:06.846 --> 33:08.746
What do you need to see me about?
We got nothing here, Bones.

33:08.782 --> 33:09.948
We don't know
who the killer is;

33:09.983 --> 33:11.783
we don't know what his
next move is gonna be...

33:11.818 --> 33:13.484
Which is why I should be
back at the lab, working.

33:13.520 --> 33:15.587
All right, look, if we could
figure out his next target,

33:15.622 --> 33:17.288
maybe we could set a trap
and catch the killer

33:17.324 --> 33:18.990
before he strikes again.
But you just said

33:19.025 --> 33:21.659
you have no idea who the
killer is going after next.

33:21.695 --> 33:23.962
I do if it's me.

33:23.997 --> 33:25.363
What...

33:25.398 --> 33:27.332
You want to make yourself
a target?

33:27.367 --> 33:29.000
The killer has an issue
with authority figures.

33:29.035 --> 33:30.335
If I could paint myself
on the news

33:30.370 --> 33:31.703
as an authority figure
on this case...

33:31.738 --> 33:34.005
After all that you've
been through with Jared?

33:34.040 --> 33:35.440
I just got you back.
I know.

33:35.475 --> 33:37.041
Caroline, please,
can you give us a minute?

33:37.077 --> 33:38.243
Oh, sure, but some other time.

33:38.278 --> 33:39.477
You two need to see this.

33:39.512 --> 33:41.412
...and if they think
a few pieces

33:41.448 --> 33:44.249
of shrapnel are gonna stop me,
they got another thing coming.

33:44.284 --> 33:46.851
What is Aubrey doing out of the hospital?
By the looks of it,

33:46.886 --> 33:49.554
something severely shaded
in stupid.

33:49.589 --> 33:50.922
Damn it, Aubrey.

33:50.957 --> 33:52.390
Now, let me be clear--

33:52.425 --> 33:54.025
I am the authority,
and I will catch the person

33:54.060 --> 33:56.094
responsible
for these horrific acts.

33:56.129 --> 33:57.996
You can count on it.

33:58.031 --> 34:00.198
That boy just painted
a big, bright target

34:00.233 --> 34:03.134
right smack in the center
of his puffed-up chest.

34:03.169 --> 34:04.435
(reporters clamoring on TV)

34:04.471 --> 34:05.737
(sighs heavily)

34:06.973 --> 34:08.572
(clamor continues)

34:13.467 --> 34:15.033
Agent Aubrey might have
bought us some time,

34:15.068 --> 34:16.768
but if he gets hurt
again, it's on us.

34:16.803 --> 34:18.570
It's not on us.
It's on him.

34:18.605 --> 34:21.373
Agent Aubrey's actions were
thoughtless and immature.

34:21.408 --> 34:22.674
At least now we know
who the killer's going after.

34:22.708 --> 34:24.141
We don't know anything

34:24.177 --> 34:25.810
for sure, and until we find
something on these remains,

34:25.846 --> 34:26.911
it'll stay that way.

34:26.947 --> 34:28.179
You're right.

34:28.215 --> 34:30.447
So let's get to work
and find ourselves a killer.

34:30.484 --> 34:31.649
That'll put us halfway there.

34:31.685 --> 34:32.851
I just finished
analyzing the tissue

34:32.886 --> 34:34.886
and found postmortem tears

34:34.920 --> 34:36.688
to the muscle
surrounding Larette's hips

34:36.723 --> 34:38.322
as well as his shoulders.

34:38.358 --> 34:40.025
Suggesting two people
carried this body

34:40.060 --> 34:41.626
into the processing center.

34:41.661 --> 34:43.395
So, two killers.
Two needles in a haystack

34:43.429 --> 34:44.696
are better than one, right?

34:44.731 --> 34:46.831
There appears to be
a depression fracture

34:46.867 --> 34:48.800
on the victim's occipital.

34:50.170 --> 34:51.536
VAZIRI: The diffused trauma
indicates the wound

34:51.571 --> 34:53.304
was caused by a wide,
flat surface.

34:53.340 --> 34:56.408
And the presence of circular
radiating fracture lines

34:56.443 --> 34:58.143
suggests an object being

34:58.178 --> 34:59.511
swung into the skull.

34:59.546 --> 35:00.745
I'll have Hodgins
swab the wound.

35:00.781 --> 35:02.480
Well, let's hope
he finds something.

35:02.516 --> 35:04.482
For Aubrey's sake.

35:06.787 --> 35:08.586
BOOTH:
<i>I don't know</i>

35:08.622 --> 35:09.862
what you were thinking, Aubrey,

35:09.890 --> 35:11.790
but we do not go on national TV
and taunt killers.

35:11.825 --> 35:13.491
That's not how we do
things around here.

35:13.527 --> 35:15.927
You're just mad because
I beat you to the punch.

35:15.962 --> 35:18.002
I know you, Booth. You were
thinking the same thing.

35:18.031 --> 35:19.564
He's got you there,<i> Cher.</i>

35:19.599 --> 35:21.232
How the hell'd you get out of
the hospital in the first place?

35:21.268 --> 35:22.467
I might have snuck out.
Snuck out.

35:22.502 --> 35:23.501
I didn't need to
be there anyway.

35:23.537 --> 35:25.503
I'm fine.
You just put yourself

35:25.539 --> 35:27.806
in the crosshairs
of a couple of deranged

35:27.841 --> 35:30.041
cop killers.
The last thing you are is fine.

35:30.077 --> 35:31.609
Right, you wear
that thing, okay?

35:31.645 --> 35:33.144
Until we find these killers,
'cause now, you're a target.

35:33.180 --> 35:34.712
AUBREY: Okay.
(phone trills)

35:34.748 --> 35:37.749
It's Hodgins. They said that
they found paraffin wax

35:37.784 --> 35:39.117
in the back
of the victim's skull.

35:39.152 --> 35:40.351
So, what,
the killer hit him

35:40.387 --> 35:42.654
in the back of the head
with a giant candle?

35:42.689 --> 35:45.056
Wax.
Wait a second, that's it.

35:45.092 --> 35:48.326
That would explain the wax
that they found

35:48.361 --> 35:50.628
on the railing
outside the abandoned plant.

35:50.664 --> 35:52.530
Yeah, but didn't Brennan say
that the weapon was swung

35:52.566 --> 35:53.998
into the victim's head?
Look, when Parker

35:54.034 --> 35:56.201
used to wax at the curb
in front of our house

35:56.236 --> 35:57.936
so the skating
would be smoother.

35:57.971 --> 36:00.638
Brennan described the weapon
as having a wide, flat surface.

36:00.674 --> 36:03.208
The victim was hit in the back
of the head with a skateboard.

36:03.243 --> 36:05.310
Booth, the kids that
called in Gallo's body--

36:05.345 --> 36:07.912
they discovered it while they were skating.
And by discovering it,

36:07.948 --> 36:11.850
they gave themselves the perfect
excuse to be at the crime scene.

36:11.885 --> 36:14.586
They wanted to witness
their work in action.

36:27.601 --> 36:30.268
FBI. We're looking for
your son Alex. Is he here?

36:30.303 --> 36:33.705
Alex is in his bedroom.
What's this all about?

36:33.740 --> 36:34.873
Would you step
outside, please.

36:34.908 --> 36:36.641
What?
Step out of the house.

CAROLINE:
Oh, there she is.

38:08.368 --> 38:11.369
How was it with the little devil children?
Well...

38:11.404 --> 38:14.005
the leader of the two
is an extremely intelligent kid

38:14.040 --> 38:15.940
with clear
psychopathic tendencies.

38:15.976 --> 38:17.108
A pretty deadly
combination.

38:17.143 --> 38:18.109
AUBREY: I'm guessing

38:18.144 --> 38:19.477
he's the one who was practically

38:19.512 --> 38:21.246
foaming at the mouth
when we took them down?

38:21.281 --> 38:22.914
Well, the kid's father
was a cop.

38:22.949 --> 38:24.449
He died years ago.

38:24.484 --> 38:26.184
Seems the job took a toll
on the man

38:26.219 --> 38:27.986
and he would then,
in turn, go home

38:28.021 --> 38:30.788
and redirect his anger
onto his wife

38:30.824 --> 38:33.691
and his kid.
When the authority figure in your life

38:33.727 --> 38:35.727
starts treating you
like a punching bag,

38:35.762 --> 38:38.529
eventually you're gonna punch back.
Right, so when

38:38.565 --> 38:41.032
he and his friend got into a
scuffle with the security guard

38:41.067 --> 38:42.267
over skating
on private property...

38:42.302 --> 38:44.435
He punched back.

38:44.471 --> 38:46.771
And next thing you know,
the little creep is manipulating

38:46.806 --> 38:49.774
his simpleton buddy into waging
an all-out war on authority.

38:49.809 --> 38:51.009
Okay, well, just so

38:51.044 --> 38:52.610
you don't have to keep
calling them

38:52.646 --> 38:54.078
the Creep and the Simpleton,
the boys names' are...

38:54.114 --> 38:55.580
CAROLINE:
I don't need their names.

38:55.615 --> 38:57.382
The world doesn't need
to know their names.

38:57.417 --> 38:59.817
These fools wanted notoriety

38:59.853 --> 39:02.654
and I'm gonna make damn sure
they never get it.

39:02.689 --> 39:05.323
I second that.

39:05.358 --> 39:07.492
Oh, my God.

39:07.527 --> 39:09.661
I just realized
I was so focused on this case

39:09.696 --> 39:11.629
that I forgot to eat today.
Could I just...

39:11.665 --> 39:13.231
Just, like, one bite.
Oh, my God.

39:13.266 --> 39:15.133
From the other side.
Are you serious?

39:15.168 --> 39:17.435
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm!

39:17.470 --> 39:19.037
Mmm. Oh!

39:19.072 --> 39:21.239
What are you doing?
Mmm...

39:21.274 --> 39:23.408
Relax, tough guy.
I'll buy you another one.

39:23.443 --> 39:25.109
Are you sure?
Because you might be so focused

39:25.145 --> 39:26.778
on eating it that you forget.

39:26.813 --> 39:29.580
Ha, ha. Ugh.
You put pickles in here?

39:30.784 --> 39:33.818
I want what she's having.

39:36.489 --> 39:38.489
Hey.

39:38.525 --> 39:40.625
Hey.

39:41.795 --> 39:43.995
I guess this is it, huh?

39:44.030 --> 39:46.097
I have to apologize.

39:46.132 --> 39:47.865
I lied to you.

39:47.901 --> 39:49.200
Lied to me?

39:49.235 --> 39:50.835
About not having a job.

39:50.870 --> 39:52.270
I don't understand.

39:52.305 --> 39:54.172
I don't officially
have one, but...

39:54.207 --> 39:55.707
there's this facility in Berlin

39:55.742 --> 39:57.275
that's been pretty aggressive
in courting me.

39:57.310 --> 39:58.976
I would have my own lab
and everything.

39:59.012 --> 40:00.478
That's incredible!

40:00.513 --> 40:02.413
Congratulations!

40:02.449 --> 40:05.316
I haven't decided if
I'm gonna take the job.

40:05.352 --> 40:08.019
Why not? It sounds like
an amazing opportunity.

40:08.054 --> 40:09.420
It's everything
you ever wanted.

40:09.456 --> 40:10.755
Why wouldn't you take it?

40:10.790 --> 40:12.857
Because it's in Berlin.

40:12.892 --> 40:15.526
And you're not.

40:16.763 --> 40:18.730
Don't d...
Please don't do this.

40:18.765 --> 40:20.498
Look, I love you.

40:20.533 --> 40:21.733
And I realize now

40:21.768 --> 40:24.836
I should have
never walked away.

40:24.871 --> 40:27.972
I'm not ready to give up
on you yet.

40:28.007 --> 40:31.409
You're more important to me
than any job could ever be.

40:31.444 --> 40:33.177
Hell, I'd go and make
cheese sandwiches

40:33.213 --> 40:36.314
for minimum wage if it meant
coming home to you every night.

40:36.349 --> 40:37.749
I'm seeing someone.
I know.

40:37.784 --> 40:39.350
But is it serious?

40:39.386 --> 40:42.253
I... I don't know.

40:42.288 --> 40:44.856
Well, if you don't know,
then it's not serious.

40:46.459 --> 40:48.960
Please.

40:48.995 --> 40:51.863
I want to be back
in your life.

40:55.268 --> 40:57.935
What do you say?

41:01.641 --> 41:03.641
(clattering,
woman screams)

41:03.676 --> 41:05.009
That sounds like...
Angela.

41:05.044 --> 41:07.278
Help!

41:07.313 --> 41:08.946
SAROYAN:
Angela!

41:08.982 --> 41:09.914
Oh, my God.

41:09.949 --> 41:12.417
Angela, what happened?

41:12.452 --> 41:13.652
I-I don't know.
We were just...

41:13.686 --> 41:14.986
we were walking out
and-and he...

41:15.021 --> 41:16.954
and he fell.

41:21.594 --> 41:23.895
Don't move him.
I'm gonna call an ambulance.

41:29.936 --> 41:32.403
Look, he's gonna be okay.
It's probably just exhaustion.

41:32.439 --> 41:34.005
Booth is right.

41:34.040 --> 41:35.940
They'll probably just
give Hodgins some fluids

41:35.975 --> 41:37.241
and send him on his way.

41:37.277 --> 41:38.543
Ms. Montenegro.

41:38.578 --> 41:40.178
It appears
your husband

41:40.213 --> 41:41.312
suffered
localized trauma

41:41.347 --> 41:42.814
during the blast.

41:42.849 --> 41:44.949
As a result there's been
significant swelling.

41:44.984 --> 41:46.117
BRENNAN:
Are these the results

41:46.152 --> 41:48.019
of his MRI?

41:48.054 --> 41:49.954
Okay, um, I'm not sure
I understand.

41:49.989 --> 41:51.589
Hodgins, he was here.

41:51.624 --> 41:54.926
He walked out of here.
He was fine.

41:56.262 --> 41:58.963
There appears to be
damage to the venous plexus

41:58.998 --> 42:00.731
surrounding
the spinal cord.

42:00.767 --> 42:02.300
And cord swelling
tends to peak

42:02.335 --> 42:04.869
24 to 48 hours
after a trauma.

42:04.904 --> 42:06.144
Okay, what-what are you saying?

42:06.172 --> 42:07.705
DOCTOR:
Dr. Hodgins had been

42:07.740 --> 42:10.641
taking aspirin, which caused
his blood to thin.

42:10.677 --> 42:12.677
This resulted
in an epidural hematoma

42:12.712 --> 42:14.779
that is compressing his spine.

42:14.814 --> 42:16.247
MONTENEGRO:
But it's okay, right?

42:16.282 --> 42:18.783
I mean,
he's gonna make it, right?

42:18.818 --> 42:19.851
Of course he's gonna make it.

42:19.886 --> 42:21.185
He's gonna be okay, right?

42:25.358 --> 42:27.925
Somebody please tell me
what's going on.

42:29.229 --> 42:31.262
Please!

42:33.399 --> 42:36.501
Hodgins is paralyzed, Angela.

42:36.536 --> 42:38.636
