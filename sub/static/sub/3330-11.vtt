00:05.005 --> 00:06.739
Walter:
<i>My name is walter o'brien.</i>

00:06.741 --> 00:11.010
<i>I have the fourth highest iq</i>
<i>ever recorded: 197.</i>

00:11.012 --> 00:12.778
<i>Einstein's was 160.</i>

00:12.780 --> 00:15.381
<i>When I was 11, the fbi</i>
<i>arrested me for hacking nasa</i>

00:15.383 --> 00:18.083
<i>To get their blueprints</i>
<i>for my bedroom wall.</i>

00:18.085 --> 00:20.252
<i>Now I run a team of geniuses,</i>

00:20.254 --> 00:23.155
<i>Tackling worldwide threats</i>
<i>only we can solve.</i>

00:23.157 --> 00:25.090
<i>Toby's our behaviorist.</i>

00:25.092 --> 00:26.759
Sylvester's a human calculator.

00:26.761 --> 00:29.028
<i>Happy, a mechanical prodigy.</i>

00:29.030 --> 00:31.397
<i>Agent cabe gallo's</i>
<i>our government handler.</i>

00:31.399 --> 00:33.599
<i>And paige?</i>
<i>Well, paige isn't like us.</i>

00:33.601 --> 00:36.035
<i>She's normal</i>
<i>and translates the world for us</i>

00:36.037 --> 00:38.670
<i>While we help her understand</i>
<i>her genius son.</i>

00:38.672 --> 00:40.606
<i>Together, we are scorpion.</i>

00:42.042 --> 00:44.043
Friday's shipment
was late.

00:44.045 --> 00:45.544
I know. Small snafu.

00:45.546 --> 00:48.147
I'll do my best so it won't
happen again, promise.

00:48.149 --> 00:50.549
Don't do your best, gary,
do <i>my</i> best, you understand?

00:50.551 --> 00:52.785
Everybody down on the ground!

00:52.787 --> 00:53.652
No one move!

00:53.654 --> 00:54.787
Okay, friend,

00:54.789 --> 00:56.188
We're just a safe
manufacturing company.

00:56.190 --> 00:57.322
We don't actually store...

00:58.792 --> 01:01.193
Anyone else want to
explain things to me?

01:01.195 --> 01:02.594
(grunts)

01:02.596 --> 01:04.797
(music playing over speakers)

01:06.666 --> 01:08.100
(music stops)

01:08.102 --> 01:09.635
Woman:
Thanks.

01:14.307 --> 01:15.574
(people murmuring)

01:15.576 --> 01:16.775
Don't shoot!

01:16.777 --> 01:19.311
I got it.

01:21.714 --> 01:23.482
(camera clicking)

01:42.402 --> 01:45.571
Patel, you sneaky little creep.

01:45.573 --> 01:48.373
You think a sniper rocket's
gonna take me out?

01:48.375 --> 01:50.342
Once you think I'm gone,
I come back!

01:51.478 --> 01:52.711
Like herpes.

01:52.713 --> 01:54.146
Couldn't you play
something less violent,

01:54.148 --> 01:55.314
Like mario bros.?

01:55.316 --> 01:56.381
Toby:
Quiet, luigi.

01:56.383 --> 01:58.217
Get ready to feel
some pain, son!

01:58.219 --> 01:59.518
Oh, wow, for a second there,

01:59.520 --> 02:01.253
I thought that cabe
was interrogating someone.

02:01.255 --> 02:02.354
Paige:
Ralph doesn't even

02:02.356 --> 02:04.156
Act like this
when he plays this game.

02:04.158 --> 02:06.258
Where is ralph?
Did you drop him off at school?

02:06.260 --> 02:09.128
No. Slept at his
dad's last night.

02:09.130 --> 02:11.230
Oh, that's, um...

02:11.232 --> 02:12.498
Good they're, um...

02:12.500 --> 02:14.766
Getting on well together;
it's positive.

02:14.768 --> 02:16.168
It is. They're connecting.

02:16.170 --> 02:19.271
It's... It's really good
for ralph. And drew.

02:19.273 --> 02:20.472
Speak of the devil.

02:20.474 --> 02:22.474
Oh, hey, guys.
Hey.

02:22.476 --> 02:24.476
Dad got me an erector set.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.311
What?
That is super cool.

02:26.313 --> 02:28.213
Looks like you guys
had a great night.

02:28.215 --> 02:29.348
Box looks old.

02:29.350 --> 02:30.549
Well, it's a
collectible.

02:30.551 --> 02:32.284
It's one of the first
ones gilbert made.

02:32.286 --> 02:33.652
I had one when
I was a kid.

02:33.654 --> 02:34.786
That was nice.

02:34.788 --> 02:36.388
Yeah, he likes telescopes.

02:38.258 --> 02:40.225
But it is, um...

02:40.227 --> 02:42.327
It's cool though.

02:43.463 --> 02:46.231
You want to go
play with that?

02:46.233 --> 02:48.767
Could I, um, talk
to you for a second?

02:48.769 --> 02:50.769
Mm-hmm.

02:50.771 --> 02:53.839
(phone ringing)

02:55.808 --> 02:57.643
Cabe.

02:57.645 --> 03:00.479
(quietly): Um, I just wanted
to ask you something.

03:00.481 --> 03:01.880
Oh, I've seen
these guys build

03:01.882 --> 03:03.448
A parabolic mic
out of an umbrella.

03:03.450 --> 03:05.751
If they're gonna listen,
they're gonna listen.

03:07.820 --> 03:09.288
Uh... I just wanted to know

03:09.290 --> 03:11.456
If you wanted to have dinner
with me tonight.

03:11.458 --> 03:12.758
Oh.

03:12.760 --> 03:14.493
I... I don't know.

03:14.495 --> 03:16.528
I'm not proposing;
it's just dinner.

03:16.530 --> 03:19.398
Since I got back into town,
we haven't had two minutes

03:19.400 --> 03:20.966
Just... Us.

03:20.968 --> 03:25.337
But you and I both know
it's... It's not that simple.

03:26.639 --> 03:27.940
So let me think about it.

03:27.942 --> 03:29.541
Absolutely.

03:31.444 --> 03:32.945
Okay.
Okay.

03:32.947 --> 03:34.513
Yeah.
Yeah.

03:38.284 --> 03:39.685
Paige:
Hey.

03:42.255 --> 03:43.488
Sylvester?

03:43.490 --> 03:44.856
Yeah?

03:44.858 --> 03:47.426
Any reason you're not
making eye contact with me?

03:47.428 --> 03:50.796
Yes. I'm uncomfortable
because we eavesdropped.

03:50.798 --> 03:52.264
Way to stay strong, sly.

03:52.266 --> 03:53.398
It was toby's idea.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.500
You guys fold like a card table.

03:55.502 --> 03:57.302
It's really not a big deal.

03:57.304 --> 03:59.371
His seed blossomed
in your fertile soil.

03:59.373 --> 04:01.506
The emotional bond
between the two of you

04:01.508 --> 04:04.309
Is ever present--
it's a huge deal.

04:04.311 --> 04:06.445
What's a huge deal?
Drew asked paige out.

04:07.313 --> 04:08.513
Oh.

04:08.515 --> 04:10.515
I didn't say yes... Yet,

04:10.517 --> 04:13.885
And it's really not a topic
for public consumption.

04:13.887 --> 04:15.020
Walter:
Yeah, you're right.

04:15.022 --> 04:16.922
Besides, we got to focus
on work.

04:16.924 --> 04:18.790
Cabe just called
with a new case.

04:18.792 --> 04:22.761
We can drop ralph off
at school on the way.

04:22.763 --> 04:26.365
Sylvester, stop letting
toby corrupt you.

04:31.604 --> 04:33.472
(siren wails)

04:35.441 --> 04:37.009
Simone:
Gallo.

04:37.011 --> 04:39.978
Well, you look the same as
you did seven years ago.

04:39.980 --> 04:43.982
Nothing worse than getting
an insult from a lady.

04:43.984 --> 04:45.984
Thank god
it's coming from you.

04:45.986 --> 04:48.020
(laughs)
toby: That's nice--
witty banter.

04:48.022 --> 04:50.289
My favorite kind of banter.

04:50.291 --> 04:51.390
Gang, this is

04:51.392 --> 04:52.991
Agent simone taylor

04:52.993 --> 04:56.928
An international task
force seven years ago.

04:56.930 --> 04:59.831
You really think
we're dealing with the ghosts?

04:59.833 --> 05:02.067
Who are the ghosts?

05:02.069 --> 05:04.303
They're an international,
incredibly effective,

05:04.305 --> 05:06.004
Incredibly brutal
gang of thieves.

05:06.006 --> 05:08.373
Jewels, cash, artwork.

05:08.375 --> 05:10.609
If you pay them enough,
they'll steal anything.

05:10.611 --> 05:13.612
And they don't care
who they kill doing it.

05:14.947 --> 05:17.316
Case in point.

05:18.484 --> 05:21.019
They're headed up

05:21.021 --> 05:22.921
By javier acosta,
out of barcelona.

05:22.923 --> 05:24.589
He handpicked his team.

05:24.591 --> 05:26.758
Sounds like a job
for law enforcement.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.460
Or superman.

05:28.462 --> 05:30.896
Law enforcement's been on
this for over a decade

05:30.898 --> 05:32.497
And have gotten nowhere.

05:32.499 --> 05:34.833
Your team is starting
to get a reputation.

05:34.835 --> 05:35.934
A good one?

05:35.936 --> 05:37.069
Yes.

05:38.071 --> 05:39.838
Let me show you
the crime scene.

05:41.774 --> 05:43.008
Paige:
They make safes here?

05:43.010 --> 05:44.676
Complex security systems.

05:44.678 --> 05:47.846
High-end, top of the line,
very expensive.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.848
The ghosts stole a safe?

05:49.850 --> 05:51.583
No, they just
broke into one.

05:51.585 --> 05:53.018
The system
they breached,

05:53.020 --> 05:55.120
Td-9000--
brand-new technology,

05:55.122 --> 05:57.789
Can be used on
any size vault.

05:57.791 --> 06:01.593
More than a dozen interlocking
composite-steel bolts,

06:01.595 --> 06:04.863
Reinforced receiving cups,
ten-gear release mechanism.

06:04.865 --> 06:09.701
This could withstand a 9.0 quake
or an industrial thermal lance.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.403
Yes, but our
witnesses said

06:11.405 --> 06:13.105
They got in with
a glass of water.

06:13.107 --> 06:14.106
Th-they did what?

06:14.108 --> 06:17.142
This... Just, um...

06:17.144 --> 06:18.510
This could be a...

06:18.512 --> 06:22.781
But the lock you just described
is as tight as a drum,

06:22.783 --> 06:25.016
Which has its strengths
and weaknesses.

06:25.018 --> 06:27.119
Now, water,
put in a confined space,

06:27.121 --> 06:30.122
Dips a little bit in the
center-- it's called a meniscus.

06:30.124 --> 06:32.958
On top of the wheel
casing, and then...

06:32.960 --> 06:34.893
And when the notches align,
there's a slight release

06:34.895 --> 06:36.595
In the tension of the gears

06:36.597 --> 06:37.963
That are wound
so tightly

06:37.965 --> 06:41.400
On this bad boy that release
makes the meniscus move,

06:41.402 --> 06:42.501
The water ripples,
which means

06:42.503 --> 06:43.935
You've hit
a combination number.

06:43.937 --> 06:45.937
Cabe:
Some of these systems

06:45.939 --> 06:48.774
Can only be purchased by
licensed banking institutions.

06:48.776 --> 06:49.641
Correct.

06:49.643 --> 06:52.611
Their water hypothesis at home,
they came to the source.

06:52.613 --> 06:53.879
They saw they were right,
and then they left.

06:53.881 --> 06:55.981
Not without killing
innocent people.

06:55.983 --> 06:57.582
Now they're planning
on hitting up

06:57.584 --> 06:59.518
The banks that have
this system in place.

06:59.520 --> 07:01.420
That's the theory
we're working on.

07:01.422 --> 07:03.989
Do you mind if we look
around a little bit?

07:03.991 --> 07:05.957
No, go ahead.
Okay.

07:09.595 --> 07:10.929
Same as last time--
shrapnel everywhere,

07:10.931 --> 07:12.597
But nothing in the
vault that can help.

07:12.599 --> 07:13.899
Run what you found for dna.

07:13.901 --> 07:16.134
Even though we both know
what the results will be.

07:16.136 --> 07:17.202
Thank you.

07:17.204 --> 07:19.204
Fill me in.

07:19.206 --> 07:21.773
They leave small
metal boxes behind

07:21.775 --> 07:25.577
In the vault-- ieds filled
with perchloric acid and oil.

07:25.579 --> 07:28.447
A timer pops, the top opens,
setting off an explosion.

07:28.449 --> 07:30.982
The acid kills any dna that
might have been left behind,

07:30.984 --> 07:33.452
And the oil
compromises all prints.

07:33.454 --> 07:35.720
Exactly. They're smart.

07:35.722 --> 07:36.955
Maybe.

07:36.957 --> 07:39.157
But they ain't smarter
than my guys.

07:39.159 --> 07:41.793
Walter: So, they
came to the source

07:41.795 --> 07:44.029
To run a test.

07:44.031 --> 07:45.897
Scientific... Method.

07:45.899 --> 07:48.467
You have to respect
their process.

07:48.469 --> 07:50.168
Except for the murder part.

07:50.170 --> 07:51.770
Walter,

07:51.772 --> 07:55.073
I think that going after
these types of people

07:55.075 --> 07:57.576
Is not what
we are best suited for.

07:57.578 --> 07:59.911
And it's not just
my fear talking.

07:59.913 --> 08:03.114
It's a question of skill sets.

08:09.255 --> 08:11.857
Duly noted.

08:12.825 --> 08:14.192
(exhales)

08:18.731 --> 08:19.998
Don't touch that!

08:39.151 --> 08:42.020
Mr. Dodd is alive,
but he's in critical condition.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.255
We've moved mr. Dodd
into surgery...

08:43.257 --> 08:45.891
Sylvester.
You can call him sylvester.

08:45.893 --> 08:49.628
Sylvester has shrapnel
in his chest and abdomen.

08:49.630 --> 08:51.530
The heat from the explosion
combined with the acid

08:51.532 --> 08:54.032
Burned through his clothes
and scalded his skin.

08:54.034 --> 08:56.801
The blunt force trauma from
striking his head on the floor

08:56.803 --> 08:58.703
Has caused swelling
about the brain

08:58.705 --> 08:59.804
But no focal injury.

08:59.806 --> 09:01.740
H-his brain will recover though?

09:01.742 --> 09:04.175
We won't know the extent
of the damage until he's awake.

09:04.177 --> 09:06.011
Do you think he's
gonna make it?

09:06.013 --> 09:08.146
I don't like to speculate.

09:08.148 --> 09:09.714
Speculate anyway.

09:09.716 --> 09:11.116
I don't think we're
communicating the kind

09:11.118 --> 09:13.051
Of mind you're dealing with--
this man is a supercomputer.

09:13.053 --> 09:16.187
He's getting
the best care possible.

09:16.189 --> 09:18.557
Excuse me.

09:18.559 --> 09:20.759
Walter.

09:20.761 --> 09:22.127
Hey, megan.

09:22.129 --> 09:25.096
She's doing her physical therapy
here in the north wing.

09:25.098 --> 09:27.065
She will be
our eyes and our ears.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.633
Meet me at the car.

09:28.635 --> 09:30.035
Wh-where are we going?

09:30.037 --> 09:31.937
We're gonna work.

09:34.173 --> 09:36.141
Thanks for rushing here.

09:36.143 --> 09:37.342
Yeah. This is so awful.

09:37.344 --> 09:39.044
How is he doing?
Well, he's in surgery.

09:39.046 --> 09:41.046
But you will relay
all information to me?

09:41.048 --> 09:42.914
Anything I hear.

09:42.916 --> 09:45.216
Any decisions that need to be
made, anything on the fly,

09:45.218 --> 09:48.954
And you can't contact me,
I need you to think like me.

09:48.956 --> 09:51.089
How would I respond,
what would I ask.

09:51.091 --> 09:53.625
I'll try.

09:53.627 --> 09:55.293
Are you okay?

09:55.295 --> 09:57.963
Yeah, I'm fine.

09:57.965 --> 09:59.998
Okay.

10:03.302 --> 10:05.704
(sighs)

10:06.906 --> 10:09.240
There's a reason a cop
gets taken off a case

10:09.242 --> 10:10.709
When his partner
gets wounded.

10:10.711 --> 10:14.813
It infuses the investigation
with anger, emotion, revenge.

10:14.815 --> 10:17.148
You get myopic, can't see
the forest for the trees.

10:17.150 --> 10:20.285
See, I don't have
those feelings, so if you...

10:20.287 --> 10:23.154
There is no purpose
to this conversation.

10:23.156 --> 10:26.157
If you expect me
to stand down...

10:26.159 --> 10:28.226
They put our boy
in the hospital.

10:28.228 --> 10:30.395
There's no way any of us
are gonna stand down.

10:30.397 --> 10:32.397
I'm just bringing it
to your attention.

10:32.399 --> 10:34.866
Keep your focus,
or it'll cost you.

10:36.135 --> 10:38.937
Let's find out who else uses
the td-9000 security system.

10:38.939 --> 10:40.338
That's gonna be
the team's next target.

10:40.340 --> 10:42.040
Let's go.

10:46.178 --> 10:48.179
Drexler bank in agoura.

10:48.181 --> 10:51.149
Leeside savings, burbank.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.217
Toby.

10:52.219 --> 10:53.385
Toby?

10:53.387 --> 10:54.753
(snaps fingers)
toby?

10:57.256 --> 10:58.790
Uh, business bank
of sylmar.

10:58.792 --> 11:00.792
So the sophistication
of the team cuts out

11:00.794 --> 11:02.894
A cash haul--
it's too easy to trace

11:02.896 --> 11:04.229
And too hard to carry.

11:04.231 --> 11:06.331
They're after something small--

11:06.333 --> 11:09.067
Is there any word
from your sister, walt?

11:09.069 --> 11:13.271
Now please help me eliminate
these possibilities.

11:13.273 --> 11:15.173
The ghosts do not
sit on their hands.

11:15.175 --> 11:18.343
Their primary strike
will come very soon.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.445
Uh... Okay.

11:20.447 --> 11:23.448
So maybe start
with locations. Um...

11:23.450 --> 11:27.819
Proximity to freeways,
airports, the escape routes.

11:27.821 --> 11:29.354
Then we can calculate
the statistical likelihood

11:29.356 --> 11:32.257
Of one site
over another, which...

11:32.259 --> 11:34.092
Is sylvester's forte.

11:34.094 --> 11:37.762
We don't have a minute, toby.
I'm taking one anyway.

11:37.764 --> 11:40.098
I'll be right back.

11:40.100 --> 11:41.933
They need to process
what's happened.

11:41.935 --> 11:44.102
No, they need to use
it. Not to be callous,

11:44.104 --> 11:46.371
But they're the perfect
team to be working on this.

11:46.373 --> 11:48.473
Can you think of anyone
else more invested?

11:53.479 --> 11:54.479
(exhales)

11:54.481 --> 11:57.916
(door opens, closes)

12:00.252 --> 12:02.787
So what's going on, doc?

12:02.789 --> 12:04.456
Do you think I was
wrong in there?

12:04.458 --> 12:06.191
With lord walter?

12:06.193 --> 12:10.361
What's the... Psychiatric term
for crapping on one guy

12:10.363 --> 12:13.031
When you're upset
about something else?

12:13.033 --> 12:15.166
Displacement.

12:17.369 --> 12:21.339
I have known sylvester
since he was 16 years old.

12:21.341 --> 12:23.374
He once sold his entire
comic book collection

12:23.376 --> 12:25.410
Just to cover my rent;
and I always told him

12:25.412 --> 12:27.011
I'll pay him back
for that one day.

12:27.013 --> 12:29.214
And you'll get your chance.

12:42.027 --> 12:44.896
Doctor, how is he?

12:44.898 --> 12:47.031
He's stabilized.
But we won't know

12:47.033 --> 12:49.033
The extent of brain function
till he wakes up.

12:49.035 --> 12:50.201
Oh, god.

12:50.203 --> 12:54.405
The one-inch piece of shrapnel
that was threatening his heart

12:54.407 --> 12:56.407
Lodged in his sternum.

12:56.409 --> 12:59.077
If it hadn't,
he'd be dead.

12:59.079 --> 13:01.146
I'll keep you posted.

13:02.481 --> 13:05.016
Wait.

13:05.018 --> 13:09.187
That piece of shrapnel--
my brother will want to see it.

13:09.189 --> 13:12.991
Nowhere near freeways
or airports.

13:12.993 --> 13:14.959
Leaves us with 38.
Can you please tell happy

13:14.961 --> 13:16.461
And toby to get back in here?

13:16.463 --> 13:18.062
They're trying
to work through the fact

13:18.064 --> 13:19.497
Their friend's life's in danger.

13:19.499 --> 13:21.032
And so are you,

13:21.034 --> 13:22.834
Just in a different way.

13:22.836 --> 13:24.302
Oh.

13:24.304 --> 13:25.370
This branch
was on fire

13:25.372 --> 13:26.437
Two weeks ago.

13:26.439 --> 13:28.173
It's being rebuilt.

13:29.141 --> 13:30.308
Walter's doing his job,

13:30.310 --> 13:32.143
And he's doing
it well.

13:32.145 --> 13:33.845
When someone's really
focused like this,

13:33.847 --> 13:35.079
It's best to give
them their space.

13:35.081 --> 13:37.282
Sometimes it's better
to give them time.

13:37.284 --> 13:39.818
We have none. The group
who wounded your friend,

13:39.820 --> 13:42.821
They'll disappear into the ether
and then they will kill again.

13:47.560 --> 13:51.062
(monitor beeping steadily)

13:51.064 --> 13:53.531
I've never seen that
before-- the lining.

13:53.533 --> 13:56.067
We've never recovered
a piece of shrapnel

13:56.069 --> 13:58.469
Bigger than a millimeter.
And only metal.

13:58.471 --> 14:00.238
I'm sorry, you're gonna
have to clear this hall.

14:00.240 --> 14:02.073
Too many people...
(slaps fire extinguisher)

14:02.075 --> 14:03.241
Okay, we are
busy here.

14:03.243 --> 14:04.409
It's okay, sir.

14:04.411 --> 14:06.244
We'll be moving on
in just a moment.

14:06.246 --> 14:08.313
It's government business.

14:08.315 --> 14:10.148
Okay, abusing the
fire extinguisher

14:10.150 --> 14:12.083
Is another form
of displacement.

14:12.085 --> 14:13.618
We deal with stress differently.

14:13.620 --> 14:15.920
You reminisce, I smash things.

14:15.922 --> 14:17.922
Happy, what do you get
from this?

14:21.227 --> 14:24.562
The ghosts need an industrial
plastic liner inside those ieds

14:24.564 --> 14:28.366
To keep the acid from eating
through the metal casing.

14:28.368 --> 14:31.102
An explosion
would normally melt it.

14:31.104 --> 14:33.071
Well, how'd it survive
this time?

14:33.073 --> 14:34.539
It was in sylvester.

14:34.541 --> 14:36.875
When the ied exploded,

14:36.877 --> 14:39.344
It superheated
all the metal.

14:39.346 --> 14:42.180
The bits that went
into sylvester cooled down

14:42.182 --> 14:43.381
From, say, 400 degrees

14:43.383 --> 14:45.183
To 150

14:45.185 --> 14:50.288
Very quickly because the human
body is good at absorbing heat.

14:50.290 --> 14:52.123
How does it help us?

14:52.125 --> 14:55.593
Polyethylene plastic is
hard as hell to affix to metal.

14:55.595 --> 14:58.429
There are processes,
especially used in car parts.

14:58.431 --> 15:01.466
I know a few guys
who do this quality of work.

15:01.468 --> 15:03.268
But I'll have to
do some research.

15:03.270 --> 15:05.904
How long has each
been in the business?

15:05.906 --> 15:08.239
Uh, one guy, 30 years,
the other two about five each.

15:08.241 --> 15:10.375
The other two,
either one has kids?

15:10.377 --> 15:12.176
Happy:
Neither.

15:12.178 --> 15:14.078
Toby:
How about doing time?

15:14.080 --> 15:17.215
The man's name is dirty
john and he did time.

15:17.217 --> 15:19.150
What the hell
are we playing 20 questions for?

15:19.152 --> 15:22.186
Good luck with him.
He won't talk.

15:22.188 --> 15:24.222
We'll think of something.

15:24.224 --> 15:26.090
We'll make him talk.

15:29.028 --> 15:31.095
(panting)

15:32.464 --> 15:34.365
(shouts)

15:34.367 --> 15:36.434
What the hell
is going on here, man?

15:38.971 --> 15:41.139
All right.
So, good. I...

15:41.141 --> 15:43.308
I guess now you got the
guy who really knows.

15:43.310 --> 15:44.709
I can go?

15:45.244 --> 15:46.444
Shut up.

15:49.048 --> 15:51.449
The only words coming out
of your mouth

15:51.451 --> 15:53.251
Need to be concerning this.

15:54.586 --> 15:57.055
And what the hell is that?

15:59.391 --> 16:03.328
It's not gonna be easy
to crack this guy.

16:03.330 --> 16:05.730
I got nothing to say
to you, bud.

16:05.732 --> 16:07.165
Nada.

16:08.200 --> 16:08.967
(grunts)

16:08.969 --> 16:09.667
(whimpering)

16:09.669 --> 16:12.136
We've narrowed it down.

16:12.138 --> 16:13.671
One of you two guys,

16:13.673 --> 16:15.306
You built the box

16:15.308 --> 16:17.642
That this shrapnel came from.

16:17.644 --> 16:20.278
And I want you to tell me

16:20.280 --> 16:22.347
Who it is.

16:24.450 --> 16:26.250
Oh, come on, man.

16:26.252 --> 16:27.752
Are you for real?

16:27.754 --> 16:29.354
I just... I just work
in a plastics factory.

16:29.356 --> 16:31.322
I just want to get out
of here. Please.

16:32.358 --> 16:33.658
You want to go first?

16:33.660 --> 16:35.660
No. Please don't.

16:35.662 --> 16:37.428
No.

16:38.564 --> 16:40.531
(whimpering)

16:43.669 --> 16:45.069
Tell me the truth.

16:45.071 --> 16:46.371
I told you,
I didn't make any boxes...

16:46.373 --> 16:47.772
(shouts)

16:47.774 --> 16:48.639
Oh, god!

16:48.641 --> 16:51.042
(crying):
Oh, god...

16:51.044 --> 16:52.777
(crying)

16:52.779 --> 16:55.346
I swear it wasn't me!

16:55.348 --> 16:56.547
(crying continues)

16:58.283 --> 16:59.283
Oh, god!

16:59.285 --> 17:01.786
Oh, oh, god!

17:01.788 --> 17:03.721
(crying continues)

17:05.457 --> 17:07.258
Okay.

17:07.260 --> 17:09.794
Okay, let's talk.

17:19.338 --> 17:21.105
Was there a reason
you had a fake blood pack

17:21.107 --> 17:23.207
And retractable knife
just lying around?

17:23.209 --> 17:26.277
I had to teach an
old boyfriend a lesson.

17:30.115 --> 17:32.150
Okay, guys, I admit
that I build stuff

17:32.152 --> 17:34.085
For shady people
from time to time.

17:34.087 --> 17:35.386
Lock picks,

17:35.388 --> 17:36.421
Smoke bombs.

17:36.423 --> 17:38.823
Incendiary explosive devices?

17:38.825 --> 17:43.461
Those boxes were built
to very detailed specs.

17:43.463 --> 17:44.529
Such as?

17:44.531 --> 17:46.764
Heavy polymer lining

17:46.766 --> 17:49.100
Used to handle
powerful non-ionized acids

17:49.102 --> 17:51.769
As well as incineration
under high heats.

17:51.771 --> 17:53.204
He ordered 20.

17:54.506 --> 17:56.707
In my game,
it's best you don't know.

17:56.709 --> 17:59.310
Can't imagine
why they call you dirty john.

18:01.747 --> 18:04.749
We need the name of the buyer.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.451
He never gave a name.

18:06.453 --> 18:07.785
Look, he's a handsome dude.

18:07.787 --> 18:11.122
He-he spoke
with a spanish accent, but...

18:12.424 --> 18:13.591
That's him.

18:13.593 --> 18:15.393
Crazy son of a bitch.

18:15.395 --> 18:17.695
(groans) when he showed up
to pick up the package,

18:17.697 --> 18:19.831
I told him
I needed an extra hour.

18:19.833 --> 18:23.267
He went nuts,
shoved a gun right in my mouth.

18:30.209 --> 18:31.509
Something's off.

18:31.511 --> 18:33.144
Javier's cold-blooded,

18:33.146 --> 18:35.780
But shoving guns in people's
mouths sounds emotional.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.849
Javier never loses
his cool.

18:37.851 --> 18:39.717
When you do that,
people remember you.

18:39.719 --> 18:42.253
Exactly. He slipped up,

18:42.255 --> 18:44.789
And now we have everything we
need to find their next target.

18:44.791 --> 18:47.825
Javier received
20 incendiary devices

18:47.827 --> 18:50.595
From dirty john, but when
the ghosts hit the safe factory,

18:50.597 --> 18:51.696
They only used 15.

18:51.698 --> 18:53.264
Meaning he has five left.

18:53.266 --> 18:55.533
The ghosts are nothing
if not efficient.

18:55.535 --> 18:57.301
Now, if each incendiary device
wipes out exactly

18:57.303 --> 18:58.703
14-and-a-half feet
of evidence, then...

18:58.705 --> 19:02.640
By figuring out which vault
requires exactly five devices.

19:02.642 --> 19:05.409
Happy, we need the blueprints
for every bank on that wall.

19:05.411 --> 19:06.744
Size of the vault
is key.

19:06.746 --> 19:07.879
Already on it.

19:07.881 --> 19:09.580
We need to scan
for spatial parameters.

19:11.717 --> 19:14.819
He really is
on fire today.

19:14.821 --> 19:17.822
Fire is exactly
what sylvester needs.

19:22.895 --> 19:23.928
(monitor beeping steadily)

19:23.930 --> 19:26.631
Megan:
Come on, big guy.

19:26.633 --> 19:28.533
Wake up.

19:28.535 --> 19:31.602
We were just starting to get
to know each other. (chuckles)

19:33.572 --> 19:35.840
Just open your eyes.

19:35.842 --> 19:37.775
Come on.

19:37.777 --> 19:40.912
Blink for me.

19:40.914 --> 19:43.614
Sylvester?

19:43.616 --> 19:44.715
(monitor beeping rapidly)
sylvester?

19:44.717 --> 19:45.816
(alarm beeping)

19:45.818 --> 19:47.418
Oh, my god. Nurse!

19:47.420 --> 19:50.188
Get me two milligrams
of lorazepam, stat!

19:50.190 --> 19:52.290
Pulse is 66 and strong.

19:52.292 --> 19:53.925
Intact.
No signs of dehiscence.

19:53.927 --> 19:57.361
Megan: That's everything the
doctors have told me so far.

19:57.363 --> 19:59.797
How bad was the seizure?

19:59.799 --> 20:01.899
A grand mal

20:01.901 --> 20:04.569
Caused by the swelling
in his brain.

20:04.571 --> 20:06.637
And what's his status?

20:06.639 --> 20:08.873
They're not sure.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.741
No way to tell yet.

20:12.945 --> 20:14.912
I'm sorry, walter.

20:14.914 --> 20:17.215
Okay, thank you for the update.

20:19.618 --> 20:20.985
We need to keep
it together.

20:20.987 --> 20:22.653
We have to focus.

20:22.655 --> 20:24.855
It isn't healthy to pretend
we're not hurting.

20:24.857 --> 20:26.457
You want to talk about hurting?

20:26.459 --> 20:28.226
Sylvester is hurting,

20:28.228 --> 20:29.827
So take a moment if you need to,

20:29.829 --> 20:31.662
And then get back
to scanning those blueprints.

20:32.631 --> 20:34.232
Hey, wait.

20:34.234 --> 20:35.566
Let him take a beat.

20:35.568 --> 20:37.501
You have no
idea how close

20:37.503 --> 20:38.970
We might be to
catching these guys.

20:38.972 --> 20:41.305
And then what?
You ever think

20:41.307 --> 20:43.407
What we'll do
the day after we catch them?

20:43.409 --> 20:44.609
You can't be so driven

20:44.611 --> 20:46.310
That you don't see
the next step ahead of you

20:46.312 --> 20:47.612
Or what you're doing
to other people

20:47.614 --> 20:49.747
While you chase your goal.

20:58.857 --> 21:00.791
For me, it's taekwondo.

21:00.793 --> 21:03.561
But if this <i>good will hunting</i>
<i>thing is how you vent...</i>

21:03.563 --> 21:05.696
Whatever works.

21:05.698 --> 21:07.531
Just trying to stay sharp.

21:07.533 --> 21:08.733
I get it.

21:08.735 --> 21:10.568
There's a lot more answers
on that board

21:10.570 --> 21:11.902
Than there are in your friend's

21:11.904 --> 21:13.037
Hospital room.

21:13.039 --> 21:15.273
You're pissed.

21:15.275 --> 21:17.875
You know, I don't, uh...

21:17.877 --> 21:20.878
I don't... Get pissed.

21:20.880 --> 21:22.013
Ah.

21:22.015 --> 21:24.715
Well, you could
have fooled me.

21:29.921 --> 21:31.889
Seven years ago,

21:31.891 --> 21:34.959
My partner and I were tailing
javier and his crew.

21:34.961 --> 21:36.727
When we got close,

21:36.729 --> 21:39.063
They practically cut him
in half with bullets.

21:39.065 --> 21:41.332
I'm sorry
about your friend.

21:41.334 --> 21:44.535
He's, uh...

21:44.537 --> 21:47.705
He's spent every day since
in a wheelchair,

21:47.707 --> 21:49.940
Drinking meals
through a straw.

21:52.978 --> 21:53.978
(clears throat)

21:53.980 --> 21:55.813
What you're feeling right now,

21:55.815 --> 21:58.683
I still feel every day.

21:58.685 --> 22:01.385
How do you deal with it?
Focus.

22:01.387 --> 22:04.088
For seven years, catching
these guys is the last thing

22:04.090 --> 22:06.457
I think about when I go
to sleep at night

22:06.459 --> 22:08.592
And my first thought
when I wake up.

22:08.594 --> 22:10.895
I'm not saying
you can't grieve.

22:10.897 --> 22:13.030
I'm saying
you can't grieve now.

22:14.733 --> 22:17.535
These people can't get away.

22:19.004 --> 22:21.072
They won't.

22:25.377 --> 22:28.012
And when we finally
lock them up...

22:28.014 --> 22:29.547
Well, I've been fantasizing

22:29.549 --> 22:31.782
About calling my partner
to give him the good news,

22:31.784 --> 22:36.754
And then finally relaxing
with a stiff drink...

22:36.756 --> 22:39.957
Knowing I've done my job.

22:39.959 --> 22:43.094
You know, after
seven years, uh,

22:43.096 --> 22:45.563
You deserve a
stiff drink.

22:58.410 --> 23:00.077
About earlier...

23:00.079 --> 23:01.746
Me, too. Let's move on.
Bigger fish.

23:01.748 --> 23:03.080
Okay, what do you got?

23:03.082 --> 23:04.915
I just scanned
the last of institutions

23:04.917 --> 23:06.817
With td-9000 security.

23:06.819 --> 23:08.719
Not a one of them
is small enough

23:08.721 --> 23:09.887
To be completely wiped out

23:09.889 --> 23:11.856
By five of those
acid-bath canisters.

23:11.858 --> 23:13.391
Mm.

23:18.130 --> 23:20.831
Maybe we're looking
at this wrong.

23:20.833 --> 23:23.467
Maybe when they hit
the safe factory,

23:23.469 --> 23:25.069
It wasn't a test run.

23:25.071 --> 23:26.704
It was an announcement.

23:26.706 --> 23:28.105
They were getting word out
that they cracked the td-9000,

23:28.107 --> 23:29.874
And they were planning
to hit another one.

23:29.876 --> 23:33.177
You knew the ghosts wanted
in the td-9000 vault,

23:33.179 --> 23:35.813
You got to move it quick.
And an armored car's

23:35.815 --> 23:37.848
Cubic footage can easily
be taken out

23:37.850 --> 23:39.884
By just five of these ieds.

23:39.886 --> 23:42.453
Boom, now we're cooking
with salt.

23:42.455 --> 23:43.988
Happy: Damn right. We start
with this company.

23:43.990 --> 23:45.089
The biggest armored car

23:45.091 --> 23:46.924
Service in l.A. County.

23:46.926 --> 23:49.160
Well, let's call and see
who got a truck.

23:49.162 --> 23:52.496
Man: I only had one
new booking today.

23:52.498 --> 23:54.598
Safe deposit box move.

23:54.600 --> 23:57.568
Client by the name of huertavas.

23:57.570 --> 23:59.069
Let me pull up the job details.

23:59.071 --> 24:00.604
Oh, my god.

24:00.606 --> 24:01.939
That's it.

24:03.176 --> 24:08.145
A venezuelan cartel boss named
huertavas hired the ghosts

24:08.147 --> 24:09.914
To steal a fortune
from his rival.

24:09.916 --> 24:12.716
They grabbed $100
million cash.

24:12.718 --> 24:14.752
Deal was, ghosts would get
a third cut.

24:14.754 --> 24:18.722
Let me guess. Senor huertavas
wasn't a man of his word.

24:18.724 --> 24:21.725
They barely got out
of venezuela alive.

24:21.727 --> 24:23.527
Probably right around
the time they swore revenge.

24:23.529 --> 24:25.629
A team on a revenge mission--
sounds familiar.

24:25.631 --> 24:26.964
Simone:
Rumor is,

24:26.966 --> 24:29.667
Huertavas converted
the cash into diamonds

24:29.669 --> 24:31.836
And hid them
somewhere in the u.S.

24:31.838 --> 24:33.103
A hundred million in diamonds

24:33.105 --> 24:35.105
Would fit
into a safe deposit box.

24:35.107 --> 24:37.107
I got it. Got it.

24:37.109 --> 24:38.976
Client ordered safe deposit box

24:38.978 --> 24:43.547
Number 1840, moved out
from santa monica trust & loan.

24:43.549 --> 24:44.882
And what time
was the pickup?

24:44.884 --> 24:46.817
Log says it was made
five minutes ago.

24:46.819 --> 24:49.720
Headed east on olympic now,
turning south on barrington.

24:49.722 --> 24:51.088
Okay, okay, you need
to call the workers.

24:51.090 --> 24:52.256
Tell them they're in danger.

24:52.258 --> 24:55.226
We're on our way.

24:55.228 --> 24:59.196
I know we want to get the guys
who hurt sylvester, but...

24:59.198 --> 25:01.265
Let's not forget who we are.

25:06.638 --> 25:09.039
Man:
Vehicle 117, come in.

25:09.041 --> 25:10.674
(tires screech)

25:10.676 --> 25:11.742
What the hell?!

25:11.744 --> 25:13.978
Vasquez, delongpre,
do you copy?

25:15.046 --> 25:16.614
(automatic gunfire)

25:16.616 --> 25:18.983
It's going to give!
We got to return fire!

25:18.985 --> 25:21.018
(automatic gunfire continues)

25:36.735 --> 25:38.903
â™ª

26:02.027 --> 26:04.194
(siren wailing)

26:04.196 --> 26:05.296
Happy:
There's two down.

26:05.298 --> 26:07.031
Animals.

26:07.033 --> 26:09.733
Homeland. You got
a 20 on the perps?

26:09.735 --> 26:11.802
Three bikes fled west on grand.

26:11.804 --> 26:12.903
Highway patrol's setting up
a roadblock

26:12.905 --> 26:15.973
They're gonna ditch the bikes
before we get there.

26:15.975 --> 26:18.042
Advantage?
Three-minute head start.

26:20.912 --> 26:22.913
(monitor beeping steadily)

26:22.915 --> 26:25.182
(grunts softly)

26:25.184 --> 26:27.885
Sylvester. Hi!

26:29.854 --> 26:32.690
Oh, thank god you're awake.

26:32.692 --> 26:34.858
Where...

26:34.860 --> 26:36.794
Where's walter?

26:36.796 --> 26:39.930
Right now I think
he's got his hands full.

26:39.932 --> 26:43.033
Once they hit the freeway
or the hills,

26:43.035 --> 26:44.301
They're too maneuverable
on those bikes.

26:44.303 --> 26:45.703
So we cut them off.

26:45.705 --> 26:46.337
(horns blaring)

26:46.339 --> 26:47.705
Head down to 22nd.

26:47.707 --> 26:49.006
Everybody hang on.

26:49.008 --> 26:50.341
(tires screeching)

26:52.944 --> 26:54.712
They're headed right for you.

26:55.981 --> 26:57.114
I see them.

27:01.720 --> 27:03.220
(tires screeching)

27:05.957 --> 27:08.926
Walter, be careful!

27:17.969 --> 27:20.204
You all right?

27:20.206 --> 27:22.306
I wedged my phone
in his backpack.

27:22.308 --> 27:23.974
Nicely done.

27:23.976 --> 27:26.010
Walter:
Okay, they're going down tenth.

27:26.012 --> 27:30.280
All right, this is homeland
security agent cabe gallo.

27:30.282 --> 27:31.949
The perps are headed
toward sixth and tenth.

27:31.951 --> 27:33.050
We're on our way.

27:33.052 --> 27:35.185
(sirens wailing)

27:39.290 --> 27:41.025
Officer: This is lapd.
We have no sighting

27:41.027 --> 27:42.793
At sixth and tenth street
location.

27:42.795 --> 27:45.329
The signal says they're passing
through right now.

27:45.331 --> 27:47.097
They should see
three motorcycles.

27:47.099 --> 27:49.933
I'm not wrong.

27:55.106 --> 27:58.008
We're half a mile
from the l.A. Aqueduct.

27:59.144 --> 28:00.678
They're in the sewers.

28:00.680 --> 28:01.779
They're underground.

28:07.085 --> 28:11.055
They're heading down pico
towards santa fe.

28:11.057 --> 28:12.956
According to
the county dwp match,

28:12.958 --> 28:15.726
There's an outlet hatch
by the sixth street tunnel.

28:22.067 --> 28:24.101
Javier: We ditch the bikes,
and we're gone.

28:24.103 --> 28:25.969
How the hell did he find us?

28:25.971 --> 28:28.038
Surprise, jackass!

28:28.040 --> 28:31.141
Okay, you know what to do.

28:31.143 --> 28:33.911
Cabe: You take javier,
we'll take the other two.

28:37.882 --> 28:39.483
Can't keep up
with these motorcycles.

28:39.485 --> 28:41.852
Let me out.
Let me out.
What?

28:41.854 --> 28:43.954
That's broadway up ahead.
What the hell are you gonna do?

28:43.956 --> 28:45.989
Happy:
I'll think of something.

28:45.991 --> 28:48.425
Flushing them back down
toward me.

28:52.130 --> 28:54.431
Oh, come on, come on.

28:57.001 --> 28:58.168
(tires screeching)

29:00.772 --> 29:02.439
Look out! Look out!
(automatic gunfire)

29:06.044 --> 29:07.377
He dropped the gun.

29:07.379 --> 29:10.748
(engine revving)

29:13.118 --> 29:14.918
Okay. Uh...

29:17.122 --> 29:19.990
87 miles per hour, 150 yards.

29:19.992 --> 29:22.025
Three, two,

29:22.027 --> 29:23.761
One.

29:31.836 --> 29:33.237
You move, I shoot!

29:35.240 --> 29:37.341
Oh, yeah.

29:39.277 --> 29:41.345
Sometimes you got
to smash stuff.

29:49.320 --> 29:51.155
I'm gonna follow him.

29:51.157 --> 29:53.490
You head to the north side
and head him off.

30:02.801 --> 30:04.234
(tires screech)

30:04.236 --> 30:07.171
Hey! Hey!

30:16.347 --> 30:19.216
(sirens wailing in distance)

30:23.321 --> 30:25.255
(tires screeching in distance)

30:32.430 --> 30:34.231
Help me.

30:34.233 --> 30:35.966
Please, pull me up.

30:38.536 --> 30:40.037
Help me!

30:40.039 --> 30:41.305
Help me.

30:43.308 --> 30:44.174
(screams)

30:44.176 --> 30:45.175
(gasps)

31:02.360 --> 31:05.062
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

31:08.166 --> 31:09.299
You all right?

31:09.301 --> 31:11.635
Yeah, yeah, I made a...

31:11.637 --> 31:14.404
Made a move to save
him, and I couldn't.

31:14.406 --> 31:16.473
Right.

31:20.178 --> 31:22.446
Pushed him hard today.

31:22.448 --> 31:25.349
We were all trying
to do the right thing.

31:25.351 --> 31:28.018
Cabe: Case like this,
if you don't close it,

31:28.020 --> 31:30.654
It becomes a sore--
won't heal.

31:30.656 --> 31:34.191
I didn't want
him to have that.

31:36.594 --> 31:40.631
What happened
on the roof...

31:40.633 --> 31:43.000
I don't feel bad
about what happened.

31:46.404 --> 31:49.506
You know me, I don't... I don't
have those kind of feelings.

31:53.945 --> 31:55.946
I got to go see sylvester.

32:04.989 --> 32:07.925
Oh, there he is.

32:07.927 --> 32:10.027
Man, you'd just do anything
to get out of work, huh?

32:10.029 --> 32:12.362
Hey, pal.

32:14.332 --> 32:15.699
How you doing, kid?

32:15.701 --> 32:17.200
Good. I'm on morphine.

32:17.202 --> 32:19.102
(laughs)
we missed you today.

32:19.104 --> 32:20.604
Could have used
you on the case.

32:20.606 --> 32:23.140
What's in the box?

32:23.142 --> 32:26.677
Oh, something I have
owed you for six years.

32:28.212 --> 32:29.513
Super fun guy comics.

32:29.515 --> 32:31.615
First 50 issues.

32:31.617 --> 32:33.717
Silver age classics.

32:33.719 --> 32:35.552
Toby, that's
your whole paycheck.

32:35.554 --> 32:38.055
I know, and
it's making me sick.

32:39.958 --> 32:42.960
I'm gonna go now,
'cause I'm a doctor,

32:42.962 --> 32:45.462
And I know
you need your rest.

32:45.464 --> 32:47.664
Otherwise, I'd be staying
here all night, pal.

32:47.666 --> 32:50.701
The rest of you clowns,
let this guy sleep.

32:50.703 --> 32:51.635
Okay.

32:51.637 --> 32:54.004
See you tomorrow,
sylvester.

32:57.141 --> 32:58.709
I'm not gonna kiss you.

32:58.711 --> 32:59.743
(chuckles)
take care, kid.

32:59.745 --> 33:01.144
Thanks.

33:02.413 --> 33:05.115
So my sister's taking
good care of you?

33:05.117 --> 33:06.717
The best.

33:06.719 --> 33:09.252
Yeah, I thought
she would.

33:09.254 --> 33:10.687
Uh, one question before I go.

33:10.689 --> 33:13.590
Um, quick brain teaser,

33:13.592 --> 33:14.691
See how the
cranium's feeling.

33:14.693 --> 33:16.994
Walter, the doctor
said he's fine.

33:16.996 --> 33:18.095
Fire away.

33:20.231 --> 33:22.733
Okay, so if a man weighing

33:22.735 --> 33:26.770
160 pounds, with an arm span
of 69 inches and a height

33:26.772 --> 33:29.339
Of 72 inches reaches
down at a 90-degree

33:29.341 --> 33:32.476
Angle to, uh, pick up a man

33:32.478 --> 33:34.544
Weighing 200 pounds,
could he lift him?

33:36.581 --> 33:38.482
That's not a brain teaser.

33:38.484 --> 33:41.051
Megan told me what happened
on the roof.

33:41.053 --> 33:43.320
That weight,

33:43.322 --> 33:45.155
That angle,

33:45.157 --> 33:47.491
He would have pulled you over.

33:47.493 --> 33:50.694
Right, but I didn't
know that when I, uh...

33:50.696 --> 33:52.262
Hesitated.

34:03.674 --> 34:05.242
Bye, megan.

34:07.045 --> 34:08.779
I'll see you
at work, sylvester.

34:11.549 --> 34:13.683
Okay, so...

34:13.685 --> 34:17.521
Do you like to fall asleep
with the tv on?

34:17.523 --> 34:19.589
Fluff your pillows?
(panting)

34:19.591 --> 34:21.124
Um...

34:25.797 --> 34:30.067
I never felt safe anywhere
on earth except for scorpion.

34:30.069 --> 34:30.834
And now not even there.

34:35.373 --> 34:37.407
How can I go back to work?

34:39.777 --> 34:41.778
You can't tell walter.

34:41.780 --> 34:42.846
Okay.

34:42.848 --> 34:44.714
You can't tell walter.
Okay.

34:44.716 --> 34:47.784
I'll help you get through this.

34:47.786 --> 34:50.787
We'll get through this

34:50.789 --> 34:54.091
Together.

34:58.262 --> 35:00.697
Hey. What are you doing here?

35:00.699 --> 35:02.799
Checking on your friend.

35:02.801 --> 35:05.102
The nurse said
he'll make a full recovery.

35:05.104 --> 35:06.736
Yeah.

35:08.606 --> 35:11.141
Walter, I've been
waiting seven long years

35:11.143 --> 35:13.743
For that drink I told you about.

35:13.745 --> 35:16.513
Would you have it with me?

35:18.282 --> 35:20.884
I'd like that. Yeah.

35:27.825 --> 35:29.893
â™ª

35:34.765 --> 35:36.833
Hey, you remember this?

35:36.835 --> 35:38.869
(humming tune)

35:38.871 --> 35:40.570
(laughs)

35:40.572 --> 35:42.372
Not since
I was pregnant.

35:42.374 --> 35:45.142
"drew, I need salty-sweet.
I need salty-sweet."

35:45.144 --> 35:47.711
I had no idea what
you were talking about.

35:47.713 --> 35:49.546
I had the
weirdest cravings.

35:49.548 --> 35:51.815
Ralph built
an incredibly realistic

35:51.817 --> 35:54.751
Suspension bridge with
that erector set I got him.

35:54.753 --> 35:57.521
Gave me detailed instructions
on how I could help.

35:57.523 --> 35:59.823
Hmm. Maybe he'll
be an engineer.

35:59.825 --> 36:02.459
As long as he's happy.

36:07.231 --> 36:10.400
You know, I think, um...
A lot about

36:10.402 --> 36:12.769
What it would have
been like if I hadn't left.

36:15.439 --> 36:17.474
Paige.

36:17.476 --> 36:20.410
Your mind is
somewhere else tonight.

36:20.412 --> 36:23.713
I'm just
thinking about...

36:23.715 --> 36:25.282
Today.

36:25.284 --> 36:26.616
Walter?

36:26.618 --> 36:28.485
The whole team.

36:32.390 --> 36:35.258
Rain check?

36:35.260 --> 36:37.594
I'd really like one.

36:40.865 --> 36:43.767
â™ª

36:43.769 --> 36:46.236
I called
my old partner's wife.

36:46.238 --> 36:48.205
She relayed the good news.

36:48.207 --> 36:50.440
Said she thought
she saw a smile.

36:50.442 --> 36:52.509
(chuckles softly)

36:52.511 --> 36:55.312
I think your friend paige
might be right

36:55.314 --> 36:57.581
About waking up tomorrow
and not knowing

36:57.583 --> 36:58.982
What to do with myself.

36:58.984 --> 37:00.584
Well, I'm confident
that you'll find

37:00.586 --> 37:03.587
A new quest for,
uh, justice.

37:10.361 --> 37:11.995
Thank you.

37:11.997 --> 37:14.297
Couldn't have
done it without you.

37:14.299 --> 37:16.399
Anytime.

37:16.401 --> 37:18.668
You know where
to find me now.

37:23.808 --> 37:27.544
My plane doesn't leave
till the morning.

37:27.546 --> 37:30.847
We could take this celebration
back to my hotel.

37:44.562 --> 37:45.962
(sighs)

37:47.965 --> 37:51.301
Simone, you're...
You are smart,

37:51.303 --> 37:52.769
You're impressive,

37:52.771 --> 37:55.405
You're, uh...
You're beautiful.

37:55.407 --> 37:57.474
I'm flattered.

38:03.481 --> 38:05.548
But, um...

38:07.051 --> 38:11.421
...There's somewhere else I-I
feel I need to be tonight.

38:12.490 --> 38:13.757
Okay.

38:16.661 --> 38:18.728
Okay.

38:26.671 --> 38:28.672
Hi.

38:28.674 --> 38:30.974
Uh, I'm here
to visit sylvester dodd.

38:30.976 --> 38:32.842
Okay, uh, friend or family?

38:35.513 --> 38:36.946
Family.

38:36.948 --> 38:38.648
(monitor beeping steadily)

38:38.650 --> 38:40.684
Hi.

38:40.686 --> 38:42.752
You guys are here, too?

38:56.534 --> 38:58.702
Submit your sitter's bill.

38:58.704 --> 39:01.504
I'll call it research.
We'll get homeland cover it.

39:03.641 --> 39:06.710
There's the one where super
fun guy meets dr. Power pants.

39:06.712 --> 39:08.445
We saved this
one for you.

39:08.447 --> 39:10.680
Thanks.
