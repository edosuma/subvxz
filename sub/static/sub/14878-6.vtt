00:23.433 --> 00:25.134
See You.

00:25.135 --> 00:26.768
Bye.

00:32.776 --> 00:35.944
We're not going to the
greenbriar next week.

00:35.945 --> 00:39.248
Michael has to finish a policy
paper and can't get away.

00:39.249 --> 00:40.783
Mommy, mommy, chloe's teasing me!

00:40.784 --> 00:43.752
I am not!
She's teasing me, mommy!

00:43.753 --> 00:46.088
Didn't you need some
time away from them?

00:46.089 --> 00:48.290
no. Never.

00:55.265 --> 00:56.899
Auggie.

00:56.900 --> 00:58.567
I have to ask.

00:58.568 --> 01:00.469
no, you don't.

01:00.470 --> 01:02.738
When you picked up
yesterday's outfit

01:02.739 --> 01:04.673
Off the floor this morning,

01:04.674 --> 01:06.575
Did you think no one would notice?

01:06.576 --> 01:09.411
- No comment.
- You're on the walk of shame.

01:09.412 --> 01:10.713
You're holding my arm,

01:10.714 --> 01:12.981
So technically,
it's our walk of shame.

01:12.982 --> 01:15.884
Although, it hardly seems fair
you get the shame and no fun.

01:15.885 --> 01:17.486
Who is it?

01:17.487 --> 01:20.522
That is so funny that you
think I'm gonna tell you.

01:22.425 --> 01:24.860
Hey. Conference room, guys.

01:26.896 --> 01:29.131
Joan. The sound of your
necklace gives you up.

01:29.132 --> 01:32.401
I only like that trick when
you do it to other people.

01:32.402 --> 01:34.670
Special activities division
is en route to brief you.

01:34.671 --> 01:36.004
This week, you belong to them,

01:36.005 --> 01:38.273
But we're goa let you operate
out of here because...

01:38.274 --> 01:39.675
Not everyone has
a braille keyboard

01:39.676 --> 01:42.144
And an embedded document
reader with voice recognition?

01:42.145 --> 01:44.480
Because I know you like
your desk arranged just so.

01:44.481 --> 01:45.647
Ah.

01:50.620 --> 01:53.655
This drone is programmed
to drop hellfire missiles

01:53.656 --> 01:56.558
On a meeting of
all-star tribal leaders.

01:56.559 --> 01:59.895
What's wrong with this picture?

02:01.097 --> 02:02.765
No one was there.

02:02.766 --> 02:04.566
They knew we were coming.

02:04.567 --> 02:06.368
This is the third
mission in two weeks

02:06.369 --> 02:08.169
That has been compromised.

02:08.170 --> 02:11.106
After the first, we shut down
assets in syria and iraq...

02:11.107 --> 02:12.741
To no avail.

02:12.742 --> 02:14.943
So it's happening on our side.

02:14.944 --> 02:16.912
That was the theory.
We also limited briefings

02:16.913 --> 02:19.548
To essential personnel
in clandestine services.

02:19.549 --> 02:21.550
Mission details still got out.

02:21.551 --> 02:22.951
Who could it be?

02:22.952 --> 02:24.420
There's really only
one possibility left.

02:24.421 --> 02:27.723
A United States senator.

02:27.724 --> 02:30.726
More specifically, a member
of the intelligence committee.

02:30.727 --> 02:32.628
They have compartmented clearance

02:32.629 --> 02:34.430
Higher than top secret.

02:34.431 --> 02:36.465
Only they have access
to these missions.

02:36.466 --> 02:38.767
I don't have to tell
you all how big this is.

02:38.768 --> 02:40.602
No member of the senate's
been convicted for treason

02:40.603 --> 02:41.937
Since 1797. - But how?

02:41.938 --> 02:44.339
The senate intelligence
briefing room is secure.

02:44.340 --> 02:47.209
No documents. Not even
notes can be taken out.

02:47.210 --> 02:48.811
Well, that's where
all of you come in.

02:48.812 --> 02:50.946
Each of you will use
your noc to gain access

02:50.947 --> 02:52.080
To a targeted senator.

02:52.081 --> 02:53.916
Jai's running point onhis.

02:53.917 --> 02:55.451
Okay. Read-in privileges.

02:55.452 --> 02:57.719
There are none.
This is completely off book.

02:57.720 --> 02:59.354
If the senate knew we were

02:59.355 --> 03:00.722
Spying on them in
their own backyard,

03:00.723 --> 03:02.858
We'd have another fisa situation.

03:02.859 --> 03:05.294
Why are we doing it?

03:05.295 --> 03:07.229
Because you're young
and you're nobody.

03:07.230 --> 03:10.465
You'll fit in perfectly
on capitol hill.

www.addic7ed.com

03:51.180 --> 03:53.415
- Who'd ya get?
- Darton.

03:53.416 --> 03:55.350
Lame duck facing ethics charges.

03:55.351 --> 03:57.185
I like my chances.
I got wallenberg.

03:57.186 --> 03:59.021
Isn't he the only one
who opposed the war?

03:59.022 --> 04:00.355
Oh, yeah. Who'd you get?

04:00.356 --> 04:02.324
- Jarvis.
- Gil jarvis.

04:02.325 --> 04:04.826
The committee chair.
he's not the leak.

04:04.827 --> 04:06.695
Joan basically said that.

04:10.333 --> 04:12.067
senator jarvis's office.

04:12.068 --> 04:13.935
Please hold.

04:13.936 --> 04:15.937
Can I help you?

04:15.938 --> 04:17.439
Annie walker.

04:17.440 --> 04:21.076
I'm here from the smithsonian
to switch out the art.

04:21.077 --> 04:22.744
As a courtesy every term,

04:22.745 --> 04:24.479
We make pieces available

04:24.480 --> 04:25.914
To members of the museum's
board of regents...

04:25.915 --> 04:27.616
Like the senator.

04:27.617 --> 04:28.950
But you don't
have an appointment.

04:28.951 --> 04:30.852
My office should have
called ahead-- can I see?

04:33.556 --> 04:35.957
I was hostess at the palm
in miami for two summers.

04:35.958 --> 04:37.592
Well, who do I talk to?

04:37.593 --> 04:40.595
You must be the smithsonian gal.

04:40.596 --> 04:42.230
I'm gil jarvis. Good to meet you.

04:42.231 --> 04:44.933
Annie walker. Thanks for
making time for me, senator.

04:44.934 --> 04:46.301
My pleasure.

04:46.302 --> 04:47.269
But you have to thank
my lovely wife madeline.

04:47.270 --> 04:48.904
Thats her lovely desk.

04:48.905 --> 04:51.273
She's in charge of the way
things look around here.

04:51.274 --> 04:52.674
Come with me.

04:52.675 --> 04:54.843
Now, you don't want to
hang around too long.

04:54.844 --> 04:56.611
She'll try to give you a makeover.

04:56.612 --> 04:58.880
Not that you need one.

04:58.881 --> 05:01.049
Please.

05:01.050 --> 05:03.218
She did this room.
There's no wet bar.

05:04.487 --> 05:06.521
I just think washington

05:06.522 --> 05:08.356
Has had its fill of
drunken senators.

05:08.357 --> 05:10.392
Madeline jarvis. - Annie walker.

05:10.393 --> 05:12.561
Finally, a woman who's interested

05:12.562 --> 05:14.663
In something more than politics.

05:14.664 --> 05:17.165
The smithsonian called
about you this morning.

05:17.166 --> 05:18.400
Welcome. - Thank you.

05:18.401 --> 05:19.801
Senator, they're ready for yoyou.

05:19.802 --> 05:22.704
Ashley, this is annie
walker from the smithsonian.

05:22.705 --> 05:24.506
She's gonna be taking things
down and puttin' stuff up.

05:24.507 --> 05:26.074
Hi. Ashley briggs.
Chief of staff.

05:26.075 --> 05:28.643
hi. I have that
exact same sweater.

05:28.644 --> 05:30.545
Good taste.

05:30.546 --> 05:33.448
Annie. How do we get our hands

05:33.449 --> 05:35.217
On wyeth's whooping crane piece?

05:35.218 --> 05:36.785
I think it would be
a perfect vertical

05:36.786 --> 05:38.386
For the reception area.

05:38.387 --> 05:40.455
- Teachers union and pakistan.
- Uh-huh.

05:40.456 --> 05:43.291
Uh...I'll find out. Andrew wyeth.

05:43.292 --> 05:45.494
No. N.C. Wyeth.
Not the other one.

05:45.495 --> 05:47.129
I said the whooping crane piece.

05:47.130 --> 05:50.298
Y- you do know the collection,
don't you?

05:50.299 --> 05:53.502
Actually, we have nature
paintings from both wyeths

05:53.503 --> 05:55.003
In our collection,

05:55.004 --> 05:56.538
<i>But I will make sure that you
get the right one.</i>

05:56.539 --> 05:57.806
What's after the meetin'?

05:57.807 --> 05:59.274
I need to freshen
you on pakistan,

05:59.275 --> 06:00.709
And we can do the rundown

06:00.710 --> 06:02.310
On the way to your 5:00 p.
M. Intel briefing.

06:02.311 --> 06:04.479
Excellent. Ladies.

06:04.480 --> 06:06.047
We're on our way. - Annie.

06:06.048 --> 06:08.316
Somethin' with animals.

06:08.317 --> 06:12.120
You know, I just-
I just love animals. Yeah.

06:16.159 --> 06:17.492
You treat them like eggs!

06:17.493 --> 06:19.327
Well, they're borrowed es.

06:19.328 --> 06:21.463
I don't want to be
the one to break 'em.

06:21.464 --> 06:23.799
hey, jimmy. Frederico.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.367
Yeah, we gotta make sure

06:25.368 --> 06:27.536
Custodial hits
jarvis's good tonight.

06:27.537 --> 06:29.504
Yeah, we got plaster on the carpet.

06:31.007 --> 06:32.908
Oh, right, it's Tuesday.

06:32.909 --> 06:36.511
Okay, well, tell him to hit
it good in the morning then.

06:55.865 --> 06:57.933
Frederico, what happens
in senator jarvis's office

06:57.934 --> 06:59.234
On tuesdays?

06:59.235 --> 07:01.303
He work late that night.

07:01.304 --> 07:02.971
I know he has a 5:00 p.
M. Briefing,

07:02.972 --> 07:04.806
But then what?

07:04.807 --> 07:06.675
All they say is no noisy vacuum.

07:06.676 --> 07:08.343
Oh. So you're not
allowed in there at all.

07:08.344 --> 07:10.312
no. But they clean his office

07:10.313 --> 07:12.047
Two times, on Wednesday
early in the morning,

07:12.048 --> 07:15.150
And later time tonight.

07:38.708 --> 07:42.210
You look perplexed.

07:42.211 --> 07:43.812
- Perplexed?
- Puzzled. Confused.

07:43.813 --> 07:46.915
In need of a drink with a coworker.

07:46.916 --> 07:48.583
I can't.

07:48.584 --> 07:51.186
Jarvis has a secret meeting
in his office Tuesday nights

07:51.187 --> 07:52.721
After the intel briefing.

07:52.722 --> 07:56.358
I have to find out who's
invited and what goes on.

07:56.359 --> 07:59.828
Ah. And you think you're going
to find an answer doodling...

07:59.829 --> 08:03.164
Curly, twirly thingies?

08:03.165 --> 08:05.433
Pinwheels. No.

08:05.434 --> 08:07.702
You're right.

08:07.703 --> 08:09.471
I have to go back, don't I?

08:09.472 --> 08:11.473
If you want answers,
you have to dig.

08:11.474 --> 08:13.241
Remember, these
senators aren't gods.

08:13.242 --> 08:15.076
They wanna be liked and
they wanna succeed.

08:15.077 --> 08:16.711
They're fallible.

08:16.712 --> 08:19.247
Just like you and me.

08:20.449 --> 08:22.383
just don't get caught.

08:29.592 --> 08:31.526
It's a small painting,
but it's priceless.

08:31.527 --> 08:33.962
I probably just
left it on his cart.

08:33.962 --> 08:35.797
I'll be quick.

08:35.798 --> 08:38.366
Nope. I'm not authorized.

08:38.366 --> 08:40.869
If we wait till
morning and it's gone,

08:40.870 --> 08:43.972
Frederico and anyone who
ever stamped his time card

08:43.972 --> 08:46.641
Is gonna be held accountable.

08:46.642 --> 08:48.610
there.

09:47.269 --> 09:49.037
I need a swipe card duplicated

09:49.038 --> 09:52.374
So I can return the original
to its rightful owner.

09:52.375 --> 09:54.442
Spencer in I.T.

09:54.443 --> 09:56.478
- Thanks. Oh, whoa.
- 'scuse me, ma'am.

09:56.479 --> 09:58.413
Hard drives you needed, sir?

09:58.414 --> 10:00.648
Oh, yeah, thank you.
Can you put them on the table?

10:00.649 --> 10:02.417
Yes, sir.

10:04.387 --> 10:07.222
Ahem.

10:07.223 --> 10:09.624
I'm playing catcher
on operation goliath.

10:09.625 --> 10:10.892
That's for that
high-threat tribal leader.

10:10.893 --> 10:13.828
What's his name? - Touraj nasir.

10:13.829 --> 10:16.197
He's holed up on a compound
on the pak-afghan border.

10:16.198 --> 10:18.833
I'm dealing with incoming
chatter and handling logistics.

10:18.834 --> 10:21.236
Right now I am bingeing
on power drinks

10:21.237 --> 10:23.304
Because, with a ten-hour
time difference,

10:23.305 --> 10:26.474
I'm gonna be here all night.

10:27.810 --> 10:29.477
You're oddly mesmerizing.

10:29.478 --> 10:33.281
so the legend goes.

10:33.282 --> 10:35.216
Can I ask you a
question about men?

10:35.217 --> 10:37.619
Mm-mm. Way too general a
question for me to sign off on.

10:37.620 --> 10:41.289
Do most men cheat
on their spouses?

10:41.290 --> 10:43.992
Where are you going with this?

10:43.993 --> 10:46.561
My brother-in-law said he was
gonna be in the office all day,

10:46.562 --> 10:48.596
And then I saw him walk out
of a hotel this afternoon.

10:48.597 --> 10:50.365
Hmm. Power nap?

10:50.366 --> 10:51.499
I'm serious.

10:51.500 --> 10:53.668
Well, maybe he had a lunch there.

10:53.669 --> 10:55.703
- At 4:00 p.M.?
- I--

10:55.704 --> 10:57.205
I'm looking for an August?

10:57.206 --> 10:59.441
Yep, right here. You from s.A.D.?

10:59.442 --> 11:00.842
Yes, sir.

11:00.843 --> 11:04.112
I've got the landsat thematic
mapping you requested.

11:04.113 --> 11:06.714
Spencer in I.T.

11:06.715 --> 11:09.551
No, I already have e
landsat calculations.

11:09.552 --> 11:11.853
I need nga to send me aster data.

11:11.854 --> 11:14.055
Got it?

11:14.056 --> 11:15.757
Okay. I guess he's gone.

11:19.662 --> 11:22.330
Two more senators cleared.
Pack is thinning.

11:22.331 --> 11:24.332
Now we know jarvis
isn't only corruptible

11:24.333 --> 11:25.300
But vulnerable.

11:25.301 --> 11:26.668
Hmm. Little too vulnerable.

11:26.669 --> 11:29.037
Nice diggin'.
I did a little on my own.

11:29.038 --> 11:31.539
Ashley's not his first,
I take it.

11:31.540 --> 11:33.208
Not even his third.

11:33.209 --> 11:35.276
He uses cash for most
of the mistress upkeep,

11:35.277 --> 11:37.645
Like jewelry and vacations.

11:37.646 --> 11:40.014
But he can't seem to resist
using membership cards

11:40.015 --> 11:41.816
To get points at the restaurants.

11:41.817 --> 11:43.551
Classy.

11:43.552 --> 11:46.087
Current squeeze ashley rowed
all four years at colgate.

11:46.088 --> 11:48.256
Her bank statements
show membership dues

11:48.257 --> 11:49.657
At the congressional rowing club.

11:49.658 --> 11:52.193
I'll pay her a visit,
do a little girl bonding.

11:54.497 --> 11:56.397
Oh, remember.

11:56.398 --> 11:58.266
Jarvis holds the cia purse strings.

11:58.267 --> 12:01.035
If you're wrong about ashley briggs,
it's a misfire.

12:01.036 --> 12:02.670
If you're wrong about jarvis,

12:02.671 --> 12:05.273
We'll be lucky to get
funding for commodore 64s.

12:05.274 --> 12:07.342
Good luck.

12:07.343 --> 12:08.977
Thanks.

12:08.978 --> 12:11.045
Thanks for that.

12:11.046 --> 12:12.480
Hey, auggie, man,

12:12.481 --> 12:13.982
We hear it's gridlock down there.

12:13.983 --> 12:15.483
Yeah, we did a sweep at 0700,

12:15.484 --> 12:17.285
And the marcbot four found an ied.

12:17.286 --> 12:20.288
They're clearing it now.
Visibility?

12:20.289 --> 12:21.890
New moon. Satellite images show

12:21.891 --> 12:23.224
There won't be any cloud cover.

12:23.225 --> 12:26.961
A clear pitch black night.
Perfect.

12:26.962 --> 12:28.963
Welcome to my world.

12:31.333 --> 12:34.202
Hey, uh...What
else you got cookin'?

12:34.203 --> 12:37.138
Who's using my itunes account?

12:37.139 --> 12:39.440
I told you he'd figure it out.

12:39.441 --> 12:42.109
We may have
downloaded a few tunes.

12:46.782 --> 12:54.655
* *

13:09.672 --> 13:11.506
Ashley briggs?

13:14.043 --> 13:16.578
The smithsonian girl.

13:16.579 --> 13:19.147
With the sweater.
Annie walker. Yeah.

13:19.148 --> 13:22.884
Well, you can't be
rowing in sneakers.

13:22.885 --> 13:25.486
No. I was running. Well, jogging.

13:25.487 --> 13:28.623
Actually, walk/jogging.
It's a good workout.

13:28.624 --> 13:31.192
well...

13:31.193 --> 13:33.661
This is the worst
part of rowing, so...

13:33.662 --> 13:36.497
Where's an unpaid
intern when you need him?

13:36.498 --> 13:37.698
Right.

13:42.571 --> 13:43.738
Thanks.

13:43.739 --> 13:45.607
- Up here?
- Yeah.

13:45.608 --> 13:48.376
- You wanna get some coffee?
- Yeah, sure.

13:51.747 --> 13:53.681
Aw...

13:53.682 --> 13:56.083
Remember when mom used to put
little notes in our lunches?

13:57.820 --> 14:00.588
I never got a note.

14:00.589 --> 14:01.856
Awkward.

14:01.857 --> 14:04.091
I guess she loved me more.

14:06.395 --> 14:08.429
Hey, hey! No hitting, girls.

14:10.199 --> 14:13.134
Um, I'm gonna try to make
it home for their bedtime,

14:13.135 --> 14:14.469
But, um...

14:14.470 --> 14:16.237
I won't keep them up.

14:21.477 --> 14:23.745
What's the paper he's working on?

14:23.746 --> 14:26.547
A johns hopkins
study about asthma.

14:26.548 --> 14:29.050
- He seems stressed.
- Yeah, poor guy.

14:29.051 --> 14:31.386
He has to work out of
the baltimore campus,

14:31.387 --> 14:33.254
Which adds two hours to
his commute every day.

14:33.255 --> 14:35.690
So he's in baltimore every day?

14:35.691 --> 14:37.692
Yeah.

14:43.505 --> 14:46.207
Auggie. I'm filing a
request with the s.A.D.

14:46.208 --> 14:48.476
To cancel your loan to
them for operation goliath.

14:48.477 --> 14:50.144
Why?

14:50.145 --> 14:52.747
- Because I need you.
- What for?

14:52.748 --> 14:55.750
Well, I can't tell you until the s.
A.D. Gives you back.

14:55.751 --> 14:57.385
Don't take me off of goliath.

14:57.386 --> 14:59.954
- Why?
- Because I need to diversify

14:59.955 --> 15:02.356
And prove my value outside the dpd.

15:02.357 --> 15:04.592
You don't care about
inter-agency politics,

15:04.593 --> 15:06.561
And you don't need to-
you've got this place wired.

15:06.562 --> 15:09.163
Joan, goliath is personal.

15:10.699 --> 15:14.001
They're guys from my old unit.

15:14.002 --> 15:16.470
I didn't know that.

15:16.471 --> 15:18.506
Well, it'd mean a lot to me.

15:18.507 --> 15:20.341
Yeah. Of course.

15:20.342 --> 15:21.876
Of course, auggie.

15:21.877 --> 15:24.378
Good luck.

15:24.379 --> 15:27.448
So I said, "darling,
it's like sitting on the beach

15:27.449 --> 15:29.183
"trying to count
the grains of sand.

15:29.184 --> 15:30.685
"all you're gonna get accomplished

15:30.686 --> 15:33.454
Is getting sunburn on your
shoulders and sand up your bum."

15:33.455 --> 15:34.755
I wish I could have been there.

15:34.756 --> 15:36.390
Wishing for something

15:36.391 --> 15:38.459
Has nothing to do with
getting it accomplished.

15:38.460 --> 15:40.027
Excuse me, mrs. Jarvis,

15:40.028 --> 15:42.396
I was able to locate
that painting you wanted.

15:42.397 --> 15:43.798
Oh, thank you!

15:43.799 --> 15:45.299
But can I deal with it later?

15:45.300 --> 15:48.135
Much later. We have a
double date to get ready for.

15:48.136 --> 15:49.370
Art can wait.

15:49.371 --> 15:52.573
tina, this is annie.

15:52.574 --> 15:53.975
She's from the smithsonian.

15:53.976 --> 15:57.211
Mrs. Varma is the wife of
the indonesian ambassador.

15:57.212 --> 15:59.313
We were vandy girls,
back in the day.

15:59.314 --> 16:01.148
And we still are.
Come on, maddie.

16:01.149 --> 16:02.650
Oh! So annie,
I'll see you tomorrow then?

16:02.651 --> 16:05.953
Yes, ma'am, I will see
you tomorrow morning.

16:05.954 --> 16:10.524
- Hello, tina.
- Ashley.

16:10.525 --> 16:12.760
Madeline, darling,
we're late for our luncheon.

16:12.761 --> 16:14.762
We're gonna lose our reservation.

16:14.763 --> 16:17.064
I'm coming, I'm coming.

16:27.909 --> 16:29.410
Not a fan?

16:29.411 --> 16:32.113
She is madeline's
one-woman support group.

16:32.114 --> 16:33.414
I suppose I shouldn't resent it,

16:33.415 --> 16:35.149
But every time they go out,

16:35.150 --> 16:36.951
The florida taxpayers
foot the bill.

16:36.952 --> 16:38.586
Tax dollars at work.

16:38.587 --> 16:41.322
And guess who has to justify
it on the expense report?

16:42.891 --> 16:45.993
How 'bout we go
rack up our own bill?

16:47.295 --> 16:49.163
We'll have another beer.

16:49.164 --> 16:50.965
Oh, and I'll have
yet another margarita.

16:50.966 --> 16:52.566
Please. And hold the salt.

16:52.567 --> 16:56.103
Did you know this place
was a hangout for spooks?

16:56.104 --> 16:58.139
Like cia?

16:58.140 --> 16:59.640
Mm-hmm.

16:59.641 --> 17:02.476
At least we'll know the
guys are full of crap.

17:02.477 --> 17:03.978
What is it about this town?

17:03.979 --> 17:05.945
Everybody here parties like
they're still in college.

17:05.946 --> 17:08.816
We need it. Our days
are pressure-filled.

17:08.817 --> 17:11.085
You got a lotta steam to let off.

17:12.521 --> 17:14.622
You think tina varma
and madeline jarvis

17:14.623 --> 17:16.156
Are on their third round by now?

17:16.157 --> 17:18.925
what?

17:18.926 --> 17:22.797
tina varma is a gold digger.

17:22.798 --> 17:26.166
she married ambassador varma

17:26.167 --> 17:28.736
Because when they go to
indonesia for his home visits,

17:28.737 --> 17:30.838
She gets treated like royalty,

17:30.839 --> 17:35.142
And here she gets to live on
other people's expense accounts.

17:35.143 --> 17:37.444
Ah! Oh--

17:40.482 --> 17:41.816
Booty text.

17:41.817 --> 17:44.785
At 11:30.

17:44.786 --> 17:46.854
- oh...
- So romantic.

17:46.855 --> 17:49.090
Wait. He wants to come over now?

17:49.091 --> 17:52.026
Now. He's 25.
He expects me to go over there!

17:52.027 --> 17:54.929
I just throw the young ones back.

17:54.930 --> 17:58.198
I think senator jarvis likes you.

18:01.069 --> 18:02.770
W- why do you say that?

18:02.771 --> 18:04.305
I don't know, it's just like...

18:04.306 --> 18:05.773
The way he looks at you.

18:05.774 --> 18:08.275
It's nice, like he
really respects you.

18:08.276 --> 18:12.146
He probably wishes
he wasn't married.

18:20.722 --> 18:23.224
Cone of silence?

18:23.225 --> 18:24.458
Of course.

18:24.459 --> 18:28.863
Their marriage is
not what it seems.

18:28.864 --> 18:30.798
He told me.

18:30.799 --> 18:32.933
- He's lonely.
- Well, I...

18:32.934 --> 18:34.835
<i>I think he was.</i>

18:34.836 --> 18:37.471
Lonely, I mean.

18:38.840 --> 18:42.143
You are in love with him?

18:42.144 --> 18:43.811
Oh, my--

18:43.812 --> 18:46.781
He is...

18:46.782 --> 18:49.350
Amazing.

18:49.351 --> 18:52.419
He's so sweet, funny,

18:52.420 --> 18:55.856
And the most brilliant
man I have ever met.

18:55.857 --> 18:57.992
He's gonna leave her

18:57.993 --> 18:59.994
After the election.

18:59.995 --> 19:01.829
When do you have
time to get together?

19:01.830 --> 19:04.665
Every Tuesday night.

19:04.666 --> 19:09.436
And Sunday afternoon,
we have a sort of...Date.

19:09.437 --> 19:12.473
That's the most washington
thing I've ever heard.

19:12.474 --> 19:14.508
you schedule your affair!

19:14.509 --> 19:16.477
Mm, mm!

19:16.478 --> 19:17.912
Can we see a menu?

19:17.913 --> 19:21.482
Please? And can we get
like some chips and salsa?

19:21.483 --> 19:23.851
Thanks.

19:27.122 --> 19:30.891
Ashley copped to the affair,
and I think...

19:30.892 --> 19:32.226
If she were the leak,

19:32.227 --> 19:33.727
She wouldn't breathe
a word of it, right?

19:33.728 --> 19:36.030
Well, not necessarily.
How drunk did you get her?

19:36.031 --> 19:38.632
She got there all on her own.

19:38.633 --> 19:40.467
Hey, can you run a name for me?

19:40.468 --> 19:43.470
- Yeah.
- Tina varma.

19:43.471 --> 19:45.339
She's the wife of the
indonesian ambassador.

19:45.340 --> 19:47.541
Maybe joan's right.

19:47.542 --> 19:49.310
Maybe senator jarvis
is being blackmailed.

19:49.311 --> 19:50.845
That's a big leap.

19:50.846 --> 19:52.713
And it requires indisputable proof.

19:52.714 --> 19:56.450
Indisputable. Got it.

20:38.693 --> 20:40.527
Hello.

21:25.040 --> 21:27.207
I just emailed you
a draft of a memo

21:27.208 --> 21:28.509
I found in madeline's desk.

21:28.510 --> 21:29.843
She must have written it.

21:29.844 --> 21:33.247
It's a resignation
speech from the senator.

21:33.248 --> 21:36.150
He says he's gonna quit because
ashley sold our secrets.

21:36.151 --> 21:38.385
Jai, the senator's not the leak.

21:38.386 --> 21:42.022
Ashley's not the leak.
His wife's the leak.

21:42.023 --> 21:44.425
And she's gonna
frame ashley for it.

21:44.426 --> 21:47.027
Is that indisputable enough for ya?

21:47.028 --> 21:49.325
Annie, you just hooked a whale.

21:54.366 --> 21:57.301
The white house wants
to be read-in on this

21:57.302 --> 21:58.769
In real time, joan.
How'd she do it?

21:58.770 --> 22:00.204
How'd she access this information?

22:00.205 --> 22:02.740
- You'll know when I know.
- What's your game plan?

22:02.741 --> 22:04.642
Are you on top of all the-
- on top of a leak

22:04.643 --> 22:06.210
From the head of the senate
intelligence committee?

22:06.211 --> 22:07.778
For christ's sake, marty.

22:07.779 --> 22:09.480
We're the head of
this investigation.

22:09.481 --> 22:11.849
I'm not doing this
jurisdictional pissing match

22:11.850 --> 22:13.017
With you.

22:13.018 --> 22:14.552
Can we get some coffee?

22:14.553 --> 22:16.287
Our people will
tail madeline jarvis.

22:16.288 --> 22:17.822
When she hands off more intel,

22:17.823 --> 22:20.324
We will discreetly bring her in.

22:20.325 --> 22:22.393
Then we will turn her.

22:22.394 --> 22:24.128
She will work for us.

22:24.129 --> 22:28.032
She will feed bogus traceable
intel to her contacts,

22:28.033 --> 22:29.867
Whoever they may be.

22:29.868 --> 22:31.435
We're going to let
her contacts walk away.

22:31.436 --> 22:33.270
Marty, when you're in
charge of an investigation,

22:33.271 --> 22:35.740
You can say book 'em and
round up whoever you want.

22:35.741 --> 22:37.608
But right now, we're gonna follow

22:37.609 --> 22:39.510
This pipeline of information
as far as we can

22:39.511 --> 22:42.446
So that when we do a takedown,

22:42.447 --> 22:44.548
We make sure we get everyone.

22:45.650 --> 22:46.550
Now, at 50 meters
to the structure,

22:46.551 --> 22:48.786
You split into three teams--

22:48.787 --> 22:51.055
One at the southwest corner,
one at the northwest corner,

22:51.056 --> 22:53.724
And the other to the front.

22:53.725 --> 22:55.926
And we suspended all flybys
for those 20 minutes.

22:55.927 --> 22:57.328
We have a convoy of backup
vehicles in peshawar

22:57.329 --> 22:58.796
At the ready.

22:58.797 --> 23:00.030
Hey, we are good to go, bro.

23:00.031 --> 23:01.499
I'm ready to start chilling

23:01.500 --> 23:04.835
With my $62' worth of
country music you bought me.

23:04.836 --> 23:06.904
Come on, man. Not even bluegrass?

23:06.905 --> 23:09.006
Straight up american country.

23:09.007 --> 23:10.975
Hoo!

23:10.976 --> 23:13.610
Later, bro.

23:14.846 --> 23:18.215
My brother-in-law is
definitely lying to my sister.

23:18.216 --> 23:20.317
- How do you know?
- He said he was gonna

23:20.318 --> 23:21.819
Be in baltimore all day,

23:21.820 --> 23:23.254
Then I saw him walk
out of a hotel in d.C.

23:23.255 --> 23:24.722
Well, maybe she knows,

23:24.723 --> 23:27.691
And she's just looking
the other way.

23:27.692 --> 23:30.060
The woman who knows
and looks the other way

23:30.061 --> 23:31.695
Is an urban myth.

23:34.666 --> 23:37.001
What's up with you?

23:37.002 --> 23:38.635
Nothing.

23:40.372 --> 23:42.573
You're... Usually funnier.

23:45.811 --> 23:47.878
S.A.D. Wants nasir alive.

23:47.879 --> 23:50.781
That's the imperative based
on the newest chatter.

23:50.782 --> 23:52.383
He has a cell in turkey,

23:52.384 --> 23:54.451
And I'm stuck at a desk at the dpd

23:54.452 --> 23:57.454
Trying to help my guys pull
off a pretty tricky mission.

24:05.030 --> 24:06.997
You're gonna nail it.

24:06.998 --> 24:08.399
You weren't on the call

24:08.400 --> 24:10.501
When they found out
I was point man.

24:10.502 --> 24:12.770
I heard the hesitation
in their voices.

24:12.771 --> 24:16.407
Your sense of hearing
is overdeveloped.

24:16.408 --> 24:18.776
Those guys love you like a brother,

24:18.777 --> 24:22.546
<i>And you are very,
very good at your job.</i>

24:24.983 --> 24:27.251
Since when did you start
giving inspirational speeches?

24:27.252 --> 24:30.787
Since you went on
loan to the s.A.D.

25:41.793 --> 25:43.661
Cabbie is en route
to the capitol grill.

25:43.662 --> 25:44.795
Yeah.

25:44.796 --> 25:46.630
- Taxi.
- Taxi.

25:46.631 --> 25:47.998
Taxi.

25:49.200 --> 25:51.201
Michael?

25:51.202 --> 25:53.871
You're supposed to be chained
to your desk an hour from here.

25:53.872 --> 25:55.873
It's not what you think.

25:55.874 --> 25:57.007
Well, I wanna know
what it really is,

25:57.008 --> 25:59.243
But not right now.

25:59.244 --> 26:01.745
Please. Don't say
anything to danielle.

26:21.132 --> 26:27.004
* *

26:27.005 --> 26:29.173
Now, I know this has
been hard on you, maddie,

26:29.174 --> 26:31.241
But you couldn't just
sit on your hands.

26:31.242 --> 26:34.911
Trust me, we'll come
through on our part.

26:36.314 --> 26:37.848
Good-bye, darling.

26:37.849 --> 26:39.216
'scuse me.

26:39.217 --> 26:41.185
I don't think my lunch
date's gonna show.

26:41.186 --> 26:43.587
I'm sorry for taking up the table.

26:56.201 --> 26:57.834
Mrs. Jarvis?

26:59.170 --> 27:00.671
Annie!

27:00.672 --> 27:03.307
Please, come, sit down.

27:03.308 --> 27:05.542
Did you just get here?

27:05.543 --> 27:07.644
I haven't paid yet.
I could get you something.

27:07.645 --> 27:09.747
Thank you. I won't be long.

27:09.748 --> 27:11.448
Is there a problem at the museum?

27:11.449 --> 27:13.283
Don't tell me we're
not getting the wyeth.

27:13.284 --> 27:16.820
Mrs. Jarvis, I'm not...
From the smithsonian.

27:16.821 --> 27:18.756
Of course you are.

27:18.757 --> 27:20.090
No.

27:20.091 --> 27:23.327
I'm afraid I'm not.

27:23.328 --> 27:25.629
What are you talking about?

27:25.630 --> 27:27.931
I need you to come
with me to langley.

27:27.932 --> 27:29.566
Langley?

27:29.567 --> 27:32.736
There are some people there
who need to talk with you.

27:32.737 --> 27:34.404
There's a car waiting out front.

27:36.708 --> 27:38.208
I'm calling my attorney.

27:38.209 --> 27:41.011
If you call your lawyer,
this becomes a legal matter

27:41.012 --> 27:44.281
With public documents.

27:44.282 --> 27:46.616
Or we can handle it discreetly.

27:54.355 --> 27:57.157
We're bringing in
your husband now.

27:57.158 --> 27:59.826
We need to know what you passed,
madeline-- all of it.

27:59.827 --> 28:02.863
I have field agents and operatives

28:02.864 --> 28:04.598
Whose lives hang in
the balance here,

28:04.599 --> 28:06.700
Not to mention ashley briggs,
whose life--

28:06.701 --> 28:09.436
It wasn't my idea...
To pin it on ashley.

28:09.437 --> 28:11.538
Was it tina varma's?

28:11.539 --> 28:13.006
She said I needed
to take my life back

28:13.007 --> 28:15.309
Into my own hands.

28:15.310 --> 28:17.711
She told me no one would get hurt.

28:17.712 --> 28:19.046
And you believed her.

28:19.047 --> 28:21.848
I worked as a teacher

28:21.849 --> 28:25.585
To put gil through law school.

28:25.586 --> 28:29.056
We built his career together.

28:29.057 --> 28:32.092
I stood by his side through
the county elections

28:32.093 --> 28:34.861
And the state elections...

28:34.862 --> 28:38.064
Endless fundraisers and speeches.

28:40.868 --> 28:42.869
All for the dream we had together.

28:42.870 --> 28:44.704
Until he cheated on you.

28:50.144 --> 28:52.212
He changed.

28:52.213 --> 28:54.614
His priorities changed.

28:59.687 --> 29:02.088
Madeline...

29:04.959 --> 29:08.462
Just for a moment,
let's be two women...

29:08.463 --> 29:10.797
Who are married to
powerful men, okay?

29:13.067 --> 29:16.670
What your husband did to you

29:16.671 --> 29:21.074
Is terrible.

29:21.075 --> 29:23.477
But what is really crushing

29:23.478 --> 29:25.545
Is that pushing ashley
briggs out of the way

29:25.546 --> 29:28.582
Wouldn't solve anything.

29:28.583 --> 29:31.584
Because another woman
would just come along.

29:33.888 --> 29:36.690
And that's why you did it,
isn't it?

29:36.691 --> 29:40.127
Because you wanted to
hurt him irreparably.

29:40.128 --> 29:43.363
You wanted to kill his career.

29:46.300 --> 29:47.834
I just wanted him

29:47.835 --> 29:50.737
To come back home with
us to gainesville.

29:52.707 --> 29:56.543
I wanted it to be like it was
when we first got married.

29:56.544 --> 29:59.179
That's not a marriage.
That's a honeymoon.

30:06.554 --> 30:07.854
Ashley was the last mistress

30:07.855 --> 30:09.623
Madeline jarvis was
willing to tolerate.

30:09.624 --> 30:12.893
Now you have to tell
ashley to take the fall.

30:12.894 --> 30:14.694
Excuse me?

30:14.695 --> 30:16.430
The indonesians need to believe

30:16.431 --> 30:17.931
That their plan is up and running.

30:17.932 --> 30:19.499
That way we can use madeline
to feed false information

30:19.500 --> 30:21.168
And trace where it goes.

30:21.169 --> 30:24.137
Ashley has to be taken into
custody for espionage, annie.

30:24.138 --> 30:26.072
We're gonna give her a new life.

30:26.073 --> 30:27.908
All she did was get
involved with the wrong guy.

30:27.909 --> 30:31.144
Who was married.
Who was her boss.

30:31.145 --> 30:32.646
Think of her as a cautionary tale.

30:32.647 --> 30:35.549
Workplace romances always
complicate it, annie,

30:35.550 --> 30:38.551
No matter how common it is.

30:45.426 --> 30:48.128
We are go/no go fellas.

30:48.129 --> 30:50.597
Stay frosty.

30:53.501 --> 30:55.635
I have to tell a
perfectly nice girl

30:55.636 --> 30:57.504
That one bad romance
has ruined her name.

30:57.505 --> 31:00.807
- Your sister?
- No.

31:00.808 --> 31:02.575
But I like where your head's at.

31:04.378 --> 31:06.279
Oh, uh, I would love to
hear about your mission,

31:06.280 --> 31:08.849
But not today-
goliath's in position.

31:08.850 --> 31:10.250
Oh.

31:10.251 --> 31:11.451
Yeah?

31:11.452 --> 31:13.920
Yeah! Today, annie walker,

31:13.921 --> 31:17.724
I am a...Closer.

31:19.961 --> 31:21.495
- Thanks.
- For what?

31:21.496 --> 31:24.731
You're all fired up when those
guys are depending on you to be.

31:24.732 --> 31:26.533
So what are you thanking me for?

31:26.534 --> 31:30.570
For inspiring me to look
at the bigger picture.

31:38.679 --> 31:40.347
Ashley?

31:40.348 --> 31:43.717
Hey, annie.

31:43.718 --> 31:45.318
We need to talk.

31:55.263 --> 31:58.565
Tell me none of
this is happenin'.

31:58.566 --> 32:02.702
I told tina about
all the affairs...

32:02.703 --> 32:04.371
You had, gil.

32:04.372 --> 32:07.374
So many years of lies.

32:07.375 --> 32:10.109
Ashley was the final straw for me.

32:11.712 --> 32:13.947
But tina promised me
no one would get hurt.

32:13.948 --> 32:17.484
Honey, how could she
promise you anything?

32:17.485 --> 32:20.153
She did not know what
the hell she was doin'.

32:20.154 --> 32:22.923
It was just scraps
of information.

32:22.924 --> 32:25.692
If it was just scraps
of information...

32:25.693 --> 32:27.327
You wouldn't be sitting here.

32:27.328 --> 32:30.530
Joan, can I talk
with you outside?

32:32.967 --> 32:35.068
Joan.

32:39.373 --> 32:41.875
What are you doing?
I was in the middle of--

32:41.876 --> 32:44.277
If the indonesians frame ashley,

32:44.278 --> 32:45.445
She'll contest it in court.

32:45.446 --> 32:46.780
It'll be messy. Public.

32:46.781 --> 32:49.082
right.

32:49.083 --> 32:50.817
Right. She's a loose end.

32:50.818 --> 32:52.352
So they frame her,
then they get rid of her.

32:52.353 --> 32:54.421
Make it look like an
accident or a suicide.

32:54.422 --> 32:55.855
I sent annie to the rowing club.

32:55.856 --> 32:58.091
She's bringing her in right now.

32:58.092 --> 33:00.226
You're telling me to
call in backup, right?

33:00.227 --> 33:01.595
This is the moment

33:01.596 --> 33:04.064
You choose to appreciate
the chain of command?

33:04.065 --> 33:05.465
Go.

33:05.466 --> 33:07.867
Madeline jarvis has
been passing state secrets

33:07.868 --> 33:09.469
To the indonesian government.

33:09.470 --> 33:11.304
She's at langley now
being debriefed.

33:11.305 --> 33:14.641
She was gonna frame you
for treason, ashley.

33:14.642 --> 33:16.810
- That's impossible.
- No, it's not.

33:16.811 --> 33:19.613
It's sick, but it's not impossible.

33:19.614 --> 33:21.648
How?

33:21.649 --> 33:23.850
And how would she convince
anyone that I did it?

33:23.851 --> 33:25.285
You took handwritten notes

33:25.286 --> 33:27.420
When he came back from
intelligence briefings.

33:27.421 --> 33:30.991
Senator jarvis had you
compare missions estimates

33:30.992 --> 33:33.493
With back-of-the-envelope
calculations you could find.

33:33.494 --> 33:36.730
He'd have you find the cost of,
say, a helicopter.

33:36.731 --> 33:38.865
In the event that it was
destroyed during an operation,

33:38.866 --> 33:40.867
It needed to be replaced.

33:40.868 --> 33:42.135
But it meant he was revealing

33:42.136 --> 33:44.471
Pieces of highly
protected information.

33:44.472 --> 33:47.474
All she had to do was compare
your handwritten notes

33:47.475 --> 33:48.942
And your history of
internet searches.

33:48.943 --> 33:51.778
And the only evidence
of any leak or notes...

33:51.779 --> 33:53.680
In my handwriting.

33:53.681 --> 33:55.482
Right.

33:55.483 --> 33:57.450
Madeline told me she sold intel

33:57.451 --> 33:59.919
On four fully funded missions--

33:59.920 --> 34:02.455
Operation cauldron,

34:02.456 --> 34:05.392
Operation side alley,

34:05.393 --> 34:08.261
Operation goliath,

34:08.262 --> 34:10.897
And operation blackjack.

34:10.898 --> 34:12.197
Keep me apprised
of the sandstorm.

34:12.199 --> 34:13.632
If it picks up any more velocity--

34:13.634 --> 34:17.103
Auggie. Operation goliath
might be compromised.

34:17.103 --> 34:20.040
- It's too late.
- Why?

34:20.041 --> 34:21.440
Goliath is on.

34:21.442 --> 34:23.409
They went radio
silent 20 minutes ago.

34:23.411 --> 34:25.512
- I trusted you.
- I know.

34:25.513 --> 34:27.414
It was my job to get
you to trust me.

34:27.415 --> 34:29.382
no.

34:29.382 --> 34:32.719
Your job is to trick people
and ruin their lives.

34:32.719 --> 34:34.853
What you do for a living

34:34.855 --> 34:37.190
Is far worse than
anything I've ever done.

34:37.190 --> 34:39.458
There are lives at stake, ashley.

34:39.460 --> 34:41.527
Put another ask in peshawar.

34:41.529 --> 34:43.963
Get us a location on kiev four.

34:43.964 --> 34:45.565
We need sustained visuals
that we can't get

34:45.565 --> 34:47.100
From our surveillance drones.

34:47.101 --> 34:49.202
So we're gonna piggyback
onto a russian satellite.

34:49.203 --> 34:52.806
Kiev four should do it.
Nothing, auggie.

34:52.806 --> 34:56.810
When was your last
contact with base camp?

34:56.811 --> 34:59.045
17 minutes ago.

35:01.148 --> 35:03.816
They're walking right into it.

35:36.061 --> 35:37.762
Ashley!

36:31.250 --> 36:33.150
Aah!

37:08.787 --> 37:11.689
The special ops unit is
approaching the compound.

37:11.690 --> 37:14.425
We're out of options.

37:16.595 --> 37:19.097
No, we're not. Kill the drone.

37:19.098 --> 37:21.365
- What?
- Smash it into the compound.

37:21.366 --> 37:23.301
It's a warning. I know my guys.

37:23.302 --> 37:25.436
They'll know what it means.

37:25.437 --> 37:27.905
- Okay. Do it.
- Copy that.

37:29.641 --> 37:31.109
When the drone hits the compound,

37:31.110 --> 37:33.778
The unit should radio in
the aborted mission, right?

37:33.779 --> 37:35.213
They should.

37:35.214 --> 37:37.482
If they don't, it means
either the drone hit my guys

37:37.483 --> 37:39.350
Or they were ambushed
by nasir's men.

37:40.552 --> 37:42.286
Direct hit.

37:42.287 --> 37:44.088
The explosion's from
inside the compound.

37:44.089 --> 37:45.923
It was booby-trapped.

37:53.532 --> 37:55.967
This is alpha.
We're aborting mission goliath.

37:55.968 --> 37:58.402
Repeat-- aborting mission goliath.

38:00.506 --> 38:02.273
- Copy that.
- You okay?

38:36.275 --> 38:38.909
Just take nice, easy breaths.

38:40.379 --> 38:41.779
That's gonna hurt for a while.

38:41.780 --> 38:43.914
I don't wanna disappear.

38:48.720 --> 38:51.656
You don't have to take the fall.

38:51.657 --> 38:53.758
There's no game anymore.

38:53.759 --> 38:55.626
I don't understand.

38:55.627 --> 38:56.894
The agency wanted to
follow the fake intel

38:56.895 --> 38:59.230
Up the food chain-
with him in custody,

38:59.231 --> 39:01.599
Tina varma knows
madeline's working for us.

39:01.600 --> 39:03.668
I don't have to give up my life?

39:03.669 --> 39:04.936
No.

39:04.937 --> 39:08.339
But the one I have
will never be the same.

39:08.340 --> 39:10.541
No.

39:10.542 --> 39:11.942
It won't.

39:15.414 --> 39:18.282
Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.

39:18.283 --> 39:22.587
I have always considered
myself a patriot...

39:22.588 --> 39:24.956
An honest man.

39:24.957 --> 39:28.326
It is, indeed, a terrible thing...

39:28.327 --> 39:31.262
To realize that you
have deceived yourself.

39:36.001 --> 39:38.335
It's not an affair.

39:41.840 --> 39:45.543
I lost my job at
brookings two months ago.

39:45.544 --> 39:49.113
I didn't want to tell danielle.

39:49.114 --> 39:52.316
That explains you
coming out of a hotel?

39:52.317 --> 39:55.219
It was a job fair, annie.

39:55.220 --> 39:57.588
I've got a phd in
healthcare policy,

39:57.589 --> 39:59.624
And I'm handing out
resumes in a ballroom.

39:59.625 --> 40:04.061
We're living on savings now.

40:04.062 --> 40:06.063
What am I supposed to tell her?

40:06.064 --> 40:07.865
The truth.

40:07.866 --> 40:09.567
My sister's a better person

40:09.568 --> 40:11.836
Than you're giving her credit for.

40:11.837 --> 40:14.372
I don't want to lose her.

40:14.373 --> 40:16.941
Then don't lie to her.

40:24.483 --> 40:28.152
My wife faces charges of treason.

40:28.153 --> 40:30.388
My chief of staff
faces public shame

40:30.389 --> 40:33.924
And damage to her career
that cannot be undone.

40:33.925 --> 40:37.595
And so I humbly apologize...

40:37.596 --> 40:42.099
To my wife, to my chief of staff,

40:42.100 --> 40:45.236
My constituents, my supporters,

40:45.237 --> 40:48.739
And to the country that I love...

40:48.740 --> 40:51.042
But am no longer worthy to serve.

40:51.043 --> 40:55.913
My resignation is immediate,

40:55.914 --> 40:59.817
My shame...Unending.

41:01.553 --> 41:07.558
And I can only pray that at
some point in the future...

41:07.559 --> 41:10.861
You find the power to forgive.

41:16.501 --> 41:19.637
* what would we be
without wishful thinking *
