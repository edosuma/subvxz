WEBVTT

00:02.220 --> 00:03.842
We're gonna have orchids
in all the pews, right?

00:03.912 --> 00:05.765
Because orchids are Donna's
favorite flowers,

00:05.885 --> 00:07.211
and she's my favorite flower.

00:07.253 --> 00:08.779
Ha ha!
We real cute.

00:08.821 --> 00:10.051
Of course there
are gonna be orchids.

00:10.085 --> 00:11.787
Do you think this is my first
time working a side job

00:11.821 --> 00:14.555
as a wedding planner
for a former co-worker?

00:14.589 --> 00:16.787
- No?
- I'm so sorry.

00:16.829 --> 00:18.291
I mostly have my rage problem
under control,

00:18.325 --> 00:20.195
but planning is very stressful.

00:20.229 --> 00:21.699
Please avoid my trigger words,

00:21.733 --> 00:24.235
"flowers," "schedule," "vows,"

00:24.269 --> 00:26.603
"bride," "groom," "food,"

00:26.637 --> 00:29.171
"love," "happy," "church,"

00:29.205 --> 00:31.009
"event," "wedding," and "Craig."

00:31.129 --> 00:32.049
I am so sorry, Craig.

00:32.077 --> 00:33.939
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:33.973 --> 00:35.843
April, walk with me.

00:35.877 --> 00:38.243
So I chose you
as my Maid of Honor because

00:38.285 --> 00:39.979
you've become one
of my best friends,

00:40.013 --> 00:41.483
- And I love you like a sister.
- Ew.

00:41.517 --> 00:43.555
But also because you're tough.

00:43.589 --> 00:44.923
My family arrives tonight.

00:44.957 --> 00:46.419
I know.
And they're all set

00:46.453 --> 00:49.027
with their welcome bags, and I
told your brother LeVondrious

00:49.061 --> 00:50.627
that he is not welcome.

00:50.661 --> 00:54.131
Good, but still, there's gonna
be 28 Meagles in one room,

00:54.165 --> 00:55.867
which means
there's gonna be drama.

00:55.901 --> 00:57.363
I will handle everything.

00:57.397 --> 00:59.171
I actually care whether
you're having a good time

00:59.205 --> 01:00.267
and are happy.

01:00.301 --> 01:01.371
It's weird.

01:01.405 --> 01:03.075
The Meagles
are a cold-blooded crew

01:03.109 --> 01:05.043
of judgmental grudge-holders.

01:05.077 --> 01:06.907
My cousin Winnie once forgot
to use a coaster

01:06.941 --> 01:09.715
at my grandpa's house, and
he wrote her out of his will.

01:09.749 --> 01:12.347
The last four Meagle family
Pictionary tournaments

01:12.381 --> 01:13.819
ended at the hospital.

01:13.853 --> 01:15.747
Legally, no more than
three Meagles are allowed

01:15.789 --> 01:18.323
on an international flight
together.

01:18.357 --> 01:19.819
But they give great gifts.

01:19.853 --> 01:21.291
Gotta get that flatware.

01:21.325 --> 01:24.427

01:42.358 --> 01:44.159
Tommy, I was at the nail salon
and I picked up

01:44.162 --> 01:45.225
some geranium hand cream.

01:45.345 --> 01:45.953
Do you wanna try it?

01:46.073 --> 01:48.431
Uh, yes.
Warm it up, please.

01:48.818 --> 01:50.388
Oh, that smells nice.

01:50.422 --> 01:51.398
I'm just gonna go
and make sure everything

01:51.432 --> 01:52.704
is set for tonight, okay?

01:52.738 --> 01:54.704
- All right, see you later.
- See you, Ron.

01:55.137 --> 01:58.463
I've always liked that Lucy.
Glad things are going well.

01:58.497 --> 01:59.344
Better than well.

01:59.464 --> 02:00.554
And guess what I have planned
for tonight?

02:00.674 --> 02:03.095
- No.
- As Donna's Butler of Honor,

02:03.129 --> 02:03.929
I'm going all out.

02:04.180 --> 02:05.385
Baby blue brocade.

02:05.419 --> 02:08.030
As a surprise,
I got a matching dress for Lucy.

02:08.064 --> 02:12.453
And do you believe Lucy will
be happy with this gift?

02:12.495 --> 02:14.865
100%!
We're so in sync.

02:14.907 --> 02:16.343
I finally feel like
I'm with the person

02:16.377 --> 02:17.884
I'm gonna be with forever.
I'd marry her tomorrow.

02:18.004 --> 02:20.320
Bully for you, son.
More importantly,

02:20.353 --> 02:22.297
do you have tri-tip for tonight?

02:22.331 --> 02:23.933
Because if not I brought my own.

02:26.947 --> 02:28.057
I love weddings.

02:28.177 --> 02:30.901
Good food, the celebration
of romantic love,

02:30.949 --> 02:32.618
and most of all, churches.

02:32.652 --> 02:34.950
Say what you will about
organized religion,

02:34.992 --> 02:37.744
those bastards knew how to
construct an edifice.

02:37.994 --> 02:39.515
[kids screaming]

02:39.632 --> 02:40.545
Okay, monsters.
[claps]

02:40.580 --> 02:42.612
Mommy and Daddy have to pack

02:42.646 --> 02:44.813
because we are going to a hotel.

02:44.847 --> 02:46.370
But Roz is gonna stay here
with you.

02:46.404 --> 02:47.970
Yeah, and we are going
to have so much fun.

02:48.004 --> 02:50.202
We're gonna play games,
we're gonna color,

02:50.244 --> 02:53.347
maybe we're gonna even sit
quietly for 30 seconds.

02:53.381 --> 02:56.380
Do you think
I could have 30 seconds?

02:56.414 --> 02:58.852
- That's all.
- She's fading.

02:58.886 --> 03:01.485
Roz, Roz, hey, hey,

03:01.519 --> 03:02.853
you are a wonderful nanny.

03:02.887 --> 03:04.653
- Oh.
- You're tough, and strong,

03:04.695 --> 03:06.325
and you're an excellent
caretaker for our children.

03:06.359 --> 03:07.693
Yeah, every time you
come to our house

03:07.727 --> 03:09.460
we are so happy to see you.

03:09.494 --> 03:11.963
I love you more than Ben.

03:11.997 --> 03:13.426
I do.

03:13.468 --> 03:15.562
If Ben left me, I would be sad,
but I would get through it.

03:15.596 --> 03:18.236
But if you left me,
I would never recover.

03:18.270 --> 03:22.005
Thanks.
That helps.

03:22.039 --> 03:23.741
I'm so used to packing for them

03:23.775 --> 03:26.075
I almost put in diapers
for myself.

03:26.109 --> 03:27.309
[on television] Incoming call.

03:27.349 --> 03:28.578
Jen Barkley.

03:28.612 --> 03:30.946
Jen Barkley is calling again.
She is relentless.

03:30.980 --> 03:33.382
Jen is a powerful
political operative.

03:33.416 --> 03:35.045
Don't you even want
to know what she has to say?

03:35.079 --> 03:37.116
She'll just say what she
always says, which is,

03:37.151 --> 03:39.413
"Leslie, would you consider
running for state senate

03:39.455 --> 03:40.854
or Congress?"
And I'll say,

03:40.888 --> 03:42.319
"Jen, thank you very much,
that's very flattering,

03:42.361 --> 03:46.727
but I love my job, and I get to
do it for the entire country."

03:46.761 --> 03:48.358
The whole world is my park.

03:48.400 --> 03:51.598
Besides, our lives are so
chaotic we can't run a campaign.

03:51.632 --> 03:54.471
Well, if you really wanted
to do it, we'd find a way.

03:54.505 --> 03:56.967
I mean,
things aren't that chaotic.

03:57.009 --> 03:58.504
All three of them just bumped
into each other

03:58.538 --> 04:00.176
and broke everything you own.

04:00.210 --> 04:01.479
[shattering]

04:01.513 --> 04:03.277
I--I don't know what that was.

04:05.711 --> 04:07.612
Oh, would you look at that?

04:07.646 --> 04:10.284
Sweetie, I think your best
friend Tom's

04:10.318 --> 04:12.620
giving his ladyfriend a gift.

04:12.654 --> 04:15.117
You know Gayle gives me a gift
each and every day.

04:15.159 --> 04:18.089
Oh, I got
the greatest gift of all.

04:18.123 --> 04:19.753
Being married to you.

04:19.786 --> 04:21.591
Oh, sweetie.

04:21.625 --> 04:24.223
Control yourselves, Gergiches!

04:24.257 --> 04:26.424
Damn, Tommy, well done!

04:26.458 --> 04:27.793
I knew you'd like it.

04:27.835 --> 04:30.300
Get changed, baby, we gotta
dominate this party.

04:30.334 --> 04:32.634
What do you think, Ron?
Tommy's the man.

04:32.668 --> 04:35.570
I normally don't get involved
in people's personal affairs,

04:35.604 --> 04:39.177
but something about a wedding...
I'll just say it.

04:39.211 --> 04:41.776
Tom is quite taken with you.

04:41.810 --> 04:43.511
[laughs]
He's taken with me, huh?

04:43.545 --> 04:44.478
Yes.

04:44.512 --> 04:46.174
He said he'd marry you tomorrow.

04:49.014 --> 04:50.644
Seems silly to stay at a hotel

04:50.686 --> 04:52.619
that's ten minutes
from our house.

04:52.653 --> 04:53.714
Well, it's been three years.

04:53.748 --> 04:55.513
We deserve one night away
together.

04:55.555 --> 04:56.952
A little downtime,
little privacy,

04:56.986 --> 04:58.846
maybe we make some more kids.

04:58.888 --> 04:59.886
Don't even joke about that.

04:59.920 --> 05:01.053
Let's just make, like,
three more,

05:01.087 --> 05:02.587
so that each one of them
can have a friend.

05:02.621 --> 05:05.283
Ugh.

05:05.325 --> 05:06.755
Jen?
What are you doing here?

05:06.789 --> 05:08.150
You idiots won't answer
my calls,

05:08.157 --> 05:09.755
and what I have to tell you
cannot wait.

05:09.789 --> 05:10.891
But--
[kids screaming]

05:10.925 --> 05:12.330
What's that horrible sound?

05:12.364 --> 05:13.529
Children.

05:13.563 --> 05:16.233
Ugh, your life is gross.

05:16.267 --> 05:17.664
My life is amazing.

05:17.698 --> 05:19.032
Jen, thank you
so much for coming,

05:19.066 --> 05:20.431
but we have to go.

05:20.465 --> 05:23.470
I have never been late for
an event that requires an RSVP.

05:23.504 --> 05:25.134
You guys live
in Pawnee, Indiana.

05:25.168 --> 05:26.204
Where do you have to go?

05:26.238 --> 05:28.897
Putting up a new scarecrow?
[laughs]

05:28.939 --> 05:30.798
Could you please
just get to the point?

05:30.832 --> 05:32.165
Sure...
Paul Hartwell,

05:32.197 --> 05:33.962
who's your congressional
incumbent from this district,

05:34.004 --> 05:36.167
is a moron,
even by Washington standards.

05:36.200 --> 05:38.963
But he wins every year,
because he's a horrible bully

05:38.997 --> 05:41.095
and nobody opposes him.
Till now.

05:41.130 --> 05:44.025
Indiana's 10th district
needs a new leader.

05:44.059 --> 05:47.223
Someone who's made it a home,
who cares about our citizens,

05:47.265 --> 05:49.062
and who understands
the local economy.

05:49.096 --> 05:51.692
Jen, I told you, I have
a dream job, I don't want to--

05:51.734 --> 05:54.363
A candidate named Ben Wyatt.

05:54.397 --> 05:55.468
Sorry?

05:55.502 --> 05:57.204
I'm dead serious, Ben.

05:57.238 --> 06:00.635
I think you should run for
the House of Representatives.

06:00.669 --> 06:01.802
Whoa!
What was that?

06:01.836 --> 06:03.202
That was huge!

06:03.244 --> 06:05.305
Hang on, this is Congress
you're talking about,

06:05.339 --> 06:08.408
like, where bills become laws.

06:08.442 --> 06:10.080
I am not qualified for that.

06:10.114 --> 06:11.975
We're talking about the
House of Representatives, Ben.

06:12.009 --> 06:13.246
You might be overqualified.

06:13.280 --> 06:15.412
Hartwell's biggest weakness
is the economy,

06:15.446 --> 06:16.610
which is your exact strength.

06:16.644 --> 06:18.313
You're young, you're smart,

06:18.347 --> 06:19.913
you're running the biggest city
in the district.

06:19.947 --> 06:22.744
I saw you handle
that WiFi thing on TV.

06:22.786 --> 06:25.180
My firm is ready to go as soon
as you say the word.

06:25.214 --> 06:26.947
You in or you out?

06:26.981 --> 06:29.742
Uh, Two of the three kids
are showering in their pajamas,

06:29.784 --> 06:32.349
and most of Ben's ties
are in the toilet.

06:32.383 --> 06:35.116
Just like, as an update
of where things are at.

06:35.149 --> 06:36.547
I mean, this is chaos.

06:38.874 --> 06:40.569
Guys, it happened
a really long time ago, right?

06:40.611 --> 06:42.105
And it was probably an accident.

06:42.139 --> 06:45.041
Oh, yeah, I'm sure the Dig Dug
machine just unplugged itself

06:45.075 --> 06:47.850
right before I was about to beat
his high score.

06:47.884 --> 06:49.616
Yeah, I'm sure
it was an accident.

06:49.650 --> 06:50.744
Hey, status report?

06:50.786 --> 06:53.183
The Meagles are weird.
The words that they say

06:53.217 --> 06:56.223
sound passive,
but seem aggressive.

06:56.257 --> 06:57.422
I feel like there should be
a term for that.

06:57.457 --> 06:59.886
Like, "nicey-meanie."

06:59.928 --> 07:03.221
Yeah, I just had to physically
separate two 80-year-old men

07:03.263 --> 07:05.595
who were arguing about whether
it was really Lena Horne

07:05.629 --> 07:07.763
in that grocery store in 1970.

07:07.797 --> 07:10.626
Okay, you stay on the Key Largo
and Denver Meagles,

07:10.668 --> 07:12.730
and I will handle
the Berlin Meagles.

07:12.764 --> 07:15.000
Done!

07:15.034 --> 07:16.967
So you thinking
about Jen's offer?

07:17.001 --> 07:18.998
Yes. I mean,
how would this even work?

07:19.032 --> 07:23.069
Our lives are so busy, and if
I won, I would be a congressman.

07:23.103 --> 07:24.740
Or woman.
I mean, equal rights.

07:24.775 --> 07:26.404
No, that doesn't apply.

07:26.438 --> 07:27.876
Okay.
Try this.

07:27.910 --> 07:31.707
Tonight, just act like
you've decided to run.

07:31.749 --> 07:32.778
And then tomorrow
at the wedding,

07:32.812 --> 07:34.440
act like you've decided
not to run.

07:34.482 --> 07:35.911
See which one feels better.

07:35.945 --> 07:39.446
Okay.
What do you think I should do?

07:39.480 --> 07:41.078
Ben has to run.

07:41.119 --> 07:42.845
I don't want to push it,
because it might backfire,

07:42.887 --> 07:44.116
but he has to run.

07:44.150 --> 07:46.451
He would be good for America,
good for the world.

07:46.485 --> 07:50.016
Ben should be the Royal Archduke
Sultan Emperor

07:50.050 --> 07:53.183
of All Inhabitable Lands
on Earth!

07:53.225 --> 07:54.887
I'm completely neutral.

07:54.921 --> 07:57.655
I will support you
no matter what you do.

07:59.561 --> 08:01.591
You told Lucy
I want to marry her?

08:01.632 --> 08:03.294
Damn it, son,
the small hamburgers.

08:03.328 --> 08:05.334
Ron! You have to walk back
what you said.

08:05.368 --> 08:07.105
Walk back sounds like lying.

08:07.139 --> 08:09.137
Can you drop your strict life
codes for a second

08:09.171 --> 08:10.337
and help me out?

08:10.371 --> 08:11.904
Even though I've known Lucy
for years,

08:11.945 --> 08:13.437
and can see myself spending
a life together with her,

the grounds of Tommy's Bahama--

08:16.806 --> 08:19.042
a private island
I'll eventually buy--

08:19.076 --> 08:21.145
that's way in the future, man.

08:21.179 --> 08:22.680
Don't call me "man."

08:22.714 --> 08:24.878
That's what you took away
from this?

08:24.913 --> 08:26.142

08:26.184 --> 08:27.877
Don't serve this man.

giant disaster he's created.

08:30.518 --> 08:31.748
[groans]

08:31.782 --> 08:34.082
Okay, starting now,
you're in campaign mode.

08:34.116 --> 08:35.553
So first up, meet and greet.

08:35.587 --> 08:36.847
You remember
how this goes, right?

08:36.881 --> 08:38.687
Your goal is to act like
everyone is interesting

08:38.721 --> 08:42.986
- and important.
- Hey, guys.

08:43.020 --> 08:44.081
Nope, too hard.

08:44.115 --> 08:47.085
- Let's try someone else.
- Okay.

08:47.119 --> 08:48.483
Oh, there's Donna's parents.

08:48.517 --> 08:49.481
- Okay?
- Okay.

08:49.515 --> 08:50.816
- Work your magic.
- You got it.

08:50.850 --> 08:53.446
Uh, hi, Mr. and Mrs. Meagle,
I presume?

08:53.480 --> 08:56.287
I am Mr. Meagle,
but we're divorced.

08:56.320 --> 08:57.718
I'm Grace Callahan.

08:57.752 --> 08:59.422
Well, I'm sorry, Ms. Callahan.

08:59.456 --> 09:03.390
It's Doctor Callahan.

09:03.424 --> 09:06.260
Well, I hope that you are
a podiatrist or a dentist,

09:06.294 --> 09:09.498
because I seem to have a case
of foot-in-mouth disorder.

09:09.532 --> 09:12.432
[laughter]

09:12.467 --> 09:14.359
Hey, guys.
How's everything going?

09:14.401 --> 09:17.061
April, we couldn't be happier,
and you are an angel for asking.

09:17.095 --> 09:19.101
Yeah, it's surprisingly
painless.

09:19.135 --> 09:22.771
No swiping,
no passive-aggressive comments.

09:22.805 --> 09:24.538
No drama at all.

09:24.572 --> 09:26.473
Here are all
the troublemakers, boss.

09:26.507 --> 09:28.967
Thank you. Meagles!
I am not screwing around.

09:29.009 --> 09:30.303
Okay?

09:30.337 --> 09:32.101
Lauren,
no more discussion of Majorca.

09:32.143 --> 09:33.708
Majorca is off limits.

09:33.742 --> 09:35.771
Brian and Gloria,
stop making Horatio feel bad

09:35.805 --> 09:38.006

No one gives a [bleep].

09:38.012 --> 09:39.841

- Yes?

09:56.852 --> 10:00.118
Lucy,
I have something to tell you.

10:00.152 --> 10:02.685
I am a liar.

10:02.719 --> 10:03.986
What?

10:04.020 --> 10:05.282
Well, no, I am not a liar.

10:05.323 --> 10:07.689
I have never lied
about anything in my life.

10:07.723 --> 10:11.690
Though I suppose you could
construe camouflage as a lie.

10:11.723 --> 10:13.361
What is happening right now?

10:13.395 --> 10:17.095
Tom wanted to convey
that he likes you a great deal.

10:17.129 --> 10:20.164
So he said that he could imagine
marrying you.

10:20.198 --> 10:21.961
And living on an island
with your kids.

10:21.995 --> 10:25.864
Wait, now we're on an island?
With kids?

10:25.898 --> 10:27.367
- Plural?
- Yes.

10:27.402 --> 10:31.069

find those little ham balls?

10:38.038 --> 10:39.372
- Yes!
- See, just thinking

10:39.406 --> 10:41.811
I'm a congressman
makes me feel like one.

10:41.844 --> 10:42.778
Yeah.

10:42.812 --> 10:44.305
Oh, also,
I have a little secret.

10:44.347 --> 10:45.712
I'm drunk.

10:45.746 --> 10:47.144
I am too.

10:56.977 --> 10:58.343
You should give a toast.

10:58.385 --> 10:59.815

for Congress,

10:59.848 --> 11:01.382
you have to give speeches,

11:01.416 --> 11:03.181
You want me to make a toast?
I'll toast it up.

the same way.

16:26.017 --> 16:28.877
But that's how I feel.

16:33.685 --> 16:37.385
Well, I'm only dating you
for the free dresses, so...

16:37.419 --> 16:39.289
I'm fine with that.

16:39.323 --> 16:40.953
[choir singing]

16:40.987 --> 16:44.587
Donna, even though I've known
you for years,

16:44.621 --> 16:48.090
I feel like I learn something
new about you every day.

16:48.124 --> 16:50.257
Just yesterday, I learned
that the Pearl Jam album,

16:50.291 --> 16:53.329
<i>Vitalogy</i> was written about you.

16:53.363 --> 16:56.696
You are an amazing, confident
woman.

16:56.730 --> 16:58.295
And I love you.

16:58.329 --> 17:02.364
I know that I can be a lot.

17:02.398 --> 17:04.627
And a while back, I was thinking
I'd never find someone

17:04.669 --> 17:06.762
who loved me for me.

17:06.805 --> 17:09.202
But you're patient, and kind,

17:09.236 --> 17:11.635
and together,

17:11.676 --> 17:13.770
we can do anything.

17:13.804 --> 17:16.536
You may now kiss the bride.

17:16.578 --> 17:19.575
[cheers and applause]

17:23.143 --> 17:24.340
Hey, Roz.

17:24.375 --> 17:26.075
Oh, okay.
We have the zebras.

17:26.108 --> 17:28.189
Tell the kids not to worry,
they're coming back home.

17:28.210 --> 17:30.271
Also, we want to give you
a raise,

17:30.305 --> 17:32.007
and anything you want
to take from our house.

17:32.041 --> 17:33.238
Okay, bye.

17:33.280 --> 17:35.005
How in the world am I supposed
to run for office?

17:35.047 --> 17:37.277
Our lives are like
one big unexpected

17:37.311 --> 17:40.380
stuffed zebra emergency.

17:40.414 --> 17:42.178
I don't know.
What do you think I should do?

17:42.212 --> 17:43.481
I told you.
I'm neutral.

17:43.515 --> 17:45.783
Honey, you have never been
neutral on anything

17:45.817 --> 17:46.783
in your life.

17:46.816 --> 17:48.277
You have an opinion on pockets.

17:48.319 --> 17:50.651
Yes, I think they should
all be bigger.

17:50.685 --> 17:51.651
Okay.
Fine.

17:51.685 --> 17:53.482
I think you should run.

17:53.516 --> 17:55.050
Yes, our lives are bonkers.

17:55.084 --> 17:58.953
But if something is worth it--
and I think this is--

17:58.987 --> 18:00.721
then you just make it work.

18:00.755 --> 18:03.624
Besides, I just read an article
on two-minute micro-naps,

18:03.658 --> 18:05.056
and the science on them
is very promising.

18:05.098 --> 18:06.159
Oh, hey!

18:06.193 --> 18:07.727
Ben Wyatt.
Any comment on the report

18:07.761 --> 18:09.198
that you're running
for Congress?

18:09.232 --> 18:11.196
I'm sorry, I can't talk
about this right now.

18:11.230 --> 18:12.363
Your only experience in politics

18:12.397 --> 18:13.962
was as a failed mayor
at age 18--

18:13.996 --> 18:16.498
Okay, please, everyone,
we're at a wedding.

18:16.532 --> 18:18.529
And I'm holding zebras.

18:18.571 --> 18:20.665
I mean, what qualifies you
to take over Hartwell's seat?

18:20.707 --> 18:22.370
Guys, listen to me, please.

18:22.404 --> 18:24.274
I'm dealing with an actual
problem right now.

18:24.308 --> 18:28.042
Okay?

18:28.076 --> 18:30.850
Which, by the way,
is what I do for a living.

18:30.884 --> 18:34.585
I solve problems
as a budget specialist,

18:34.619 --> 18:35.848
and for five years
as a City Manager,

18:35.882 --> 18:37.447
and I'm pretty good at it.

18:37.489 --> 18:39.980
I have worked hard
to transform this area

18:40.022 --> 18:41.915
into a fiscally sound
destination

18:41.949 --> 18:44.682
for people who want good jobs,
and a good public education,

18:44.724 --> 18:46.689
and I think the results speak
for themselves.

18:46.723 --> 18:50.591
[cameras clicking]

18:50.625 --> 18:53.094
My name is Ben Wyatt,
and I'm running for Congress.

18:53.128 --> 18:54.661
[cameras clicking]

18:54.695 --> 18:57.197
Oh, my God, babe,
that was so hot.

18:58.767 --> 19:00.661
- Donna.
- Hey.

19:00.695 --> 19:02.060
How did I do?

19:02.102 --> 19:05.297
Everything was perfect.
You are a miracle worker.

19:05.331 --> 19:08.334
But I gotta say I kind of miss
the Meagle drama.

19:08.368 --> 19:11.069
I thought for sure somebody
was gonna do something crazy.

19:11.103 --> 19:13.235
But everybody's just nice
and chill.

19:13.269 --> 19:15.402
Anyway, I love you,
and to thank you,

19:15.436 --> 19:17.664
- I'm gonna try not to hug you.
- Thank you.

19:17.706 --> 19:19.134
- I'm going to--
- No!

19:19.168 --> 19:22.773
Okay, okay.

19:22.807 --> 19:26.036
Wyatt, why didn't you tell us
you're running for congress?

19:26.078 --> 19:28.906
Well, we didn't want to
steal your thunder.

19:28.940 --> 19:30.377
Steal my thunder?

19:30.411 --> 19:31.577
I'm sorry, have you seen how
I'm wearing this dress?

19:31.611 --> 19:33.641
[chuckles] Okay,
well in that case,

19:33.682 --> 19:35.942
uh, yes, I am.

19:35.976 --> 19:38.709
All right!
[cheers and applause]

19:38.743 --> 19:41.046
- To Ben.
- Donna and Joe.

19:41.080 --> 19:42.647
To me.
I own my own restaurant

19:42.689 --> 19:43.952
and several other properties.

19:43.986 --> 19:47.424
- That's always worth celebrating.
- Hear hear.

19:47.458 --> 19:48.793
Who's Garry?

19:48.827 --> 19:51.364
Oh, I think that's
supposed to be me.

19:51.398 --> 19:53.766
Ha ha. That's your new name.
Garry.

19:53.808 --> 19:57.236
- Garry!
All: Garry! Garry! Garry!

19:57.270 --> 19:59.277
- Garry! Garry!
- "Hi, I'm Garry!"

19:59.311 --> 20:01.310
Garry is my real name.

20:01.344 --> 20:03.949
Yes, after 30 years,
my coworkers are finally

20:03.983 --> 20:06.244
going to call me
by my real name.

20:06.278 --> 20:09.282
Oh, boy, I'm blessed.

20:09.316 --> 20:12.080
Everyone, can I have
your attention, please.

20:12.114 --> 20:14.917
Now it's time for a surprise
musical guest,

20:14.951 --> 20:18.216
One of my time favorites...
me.

20:18.250 --> 20:20.614

20:26.352 --> 20:28.557

I hope you saved a slice
of that cake

20:30.420 --> 20:34.056
for your estranged brother
LeVondrious!

20:34.090 --> 20:36.256
[all gasp]

20:36.290 --> 20:38.930
What's up, girl?

20:38.964 --> 20:41.394
Didn't expect to see your baby
bro at your wedding, huh?

20:41.436 --> 20:42.731
Well, I'm here...

20:42.765 --> 20:44.606
despite what you did to me
all those years ago.

20:44.637 --> 20:45.939
What I did?

20:45.973 --> 20:47.635
This is because of what you did.

20:47.677 --> 20:49.474
Oh, you must be referring
to the microwave incident.

20:49.508 --> 20:51.337
- Yeah.
- Don't worry.

20:51.379 --> 20:55.772
I brought it back.

20:55.806 --> 20:57.244
Well.

20:57.278 --> 20:58.843
[all gasp, shout]

20:58.877 --> 21:01.474
Now no one gets any popcorn.

21:03.781 --> 21:05.578
You said you wanted
a little drama.

21:05.620 --> 21:07.849
That's why I love you, girl!
