00:11.887 --> 00:15.224
<i>When I was fat, "squat" was more
of an adjective than a verb.</i>

00:15.432 --> 00:18.268
<i>But Bob made everything more meaningful.</i>

00:20.312 --> 00:21.313
On your back.

00:21.855 --> 00:22.773
Time to stretch.

00:23.232 --> 00:27.778
<i>But in a couple of months, I'd be 18,
and then Bob's resting-anus-face wife</i>

00:27.861 --> 00:30.322
<i>would be the only thing left
standing in my way.</i>

00:30.405 --> 00:31.365
Switch.

00:32.616 --> 00:35.369
And breathe.

00:35.452 --> 00:38.789
<i>Lucky for me, I have the perfect grenade
to blow up Bob's marriage.</i>

00:38.872 --> 00:43.001
<i>A necklace from his ex-lover,
proof that he had an affair.</i>

00:43.085 --> 00:46.088
<i>I just have to find the perfect time
to drop the bomb.</i>

00:46.421 --> 00:49.508
Bob Armstrong. What in the hell?

00:50.133 --> 00:50.968
Oh, hi, Coralee.

00:51.301 --> 00:52.135
Patty.

00:52.219 --> 00:54.137
<i>See? Anus face.</i>

00:54.555 --> 00:55.973
What are you doing?

00:56.098 --> 00:57.182
Stretching Patty out.

00:57.599 --> 00:58.809
I'm super tight.

00:59.434 --> 01:01.562
You look really loose to me.

01:01.645 --> 01:04.772
We are getting her in shape for
the Miss Okefenokee Swamp Pageant.

01:05.399 --> 01:07.693
It's the last pageant
before Miss Magic Jesus,

01:07.776 --> 01:09.653
and Patty needs a win to qualify.

01:09.736 --> 01:11.405
Well, you are out of luck.

01:11.488 --> 01:13.615
There's a mosquito outbreak
in northern Florida.

01:13.699 --> 01:16.451
Zika, West Nile, it's all over the news.

01:16.535 --> 01:19.580
If the pageant were canceled,
I'd have gotten an email.

01:19.663 --> 01:22.207
- Oh, shit, there's an email.
- Wait.

01:22.791 --> 01:26.420
What? We can't wait a whole other year.
I really want this.

01:26.503 --> 01:28.213
There has to be another way
to get me qualified.

01:28.297 --> 01:29.131
Let me think.

01:29.214 --> 01:30.215
Straddle.

01:31.425 --> 01:32.384
Lean to me.

01:35.721 --> 01:37.764
You know what?
Maybe you could think somewhere else,

01:37.848 --> 01:42.644
preferably not in public and not with
her face in your general groin area?

01:42.728 --> 01:46.148
Why did you buy us a gym membership
if you didn't want me to use it?

01:46.231 --> 01:47.065
Oh, Bob.

01:47.149 --> 01:48.650
Hey, buddy.

01:48.734 --> 01:50.402
- How are you?
- Good to see you.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.573
That's why you joined.

01:54.656 --> 01:56.867
You are stalking Etta Mae Barnard.

01:56.950 --> 02:00.162
You make it sound like I want to kill her.
I just want to be her.

02:00.245 --> 02:01.663
Oh, yeah, that's a lot less creepy.

02:02.581 --> 02:05.917
- Hey, guys! Bob, Etta Mae. Hi.
- Hey!

02:06.001 --> 02:07.586
- Will you come with me?
- Yes.

02:07.878 --> 02:10.922
Fifty more sit-ups, then you're done.
We'll talk soon.

02:11.298 --> 02:12.215
Okay. Come on.

02:12.299 --> 02:15.719
Junior League.Â Junior League.
Junior League.

02:20.265 --> 02:23.852
<i>I guess "Bob and Patty forever"
would have to wait.</i>

02:25.000 --> 02:31.074

02:35.072 --> 02:36.031
Bob?

02:37.491 --> 02:38.533
It's his.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.035
See?

02:42.871 --> 02:44.206
And this one's yours.

02:48.043 --> 02:49.711
It's like we never left high school.

02:49.795 --> 02:52.631
Come on, they have to distinguish
between us somehow.

02:52.714 --> 02:54.132
You prefer Older Bob?

02:54.216 --> 02:57.469
Four days, I am older by four days.

02:57.552 --> 02:58.720
Well, still.

03:00.347 --> 03:02.724
So when is the next Junior League event?
Maybe I could...

03:02.808 --> 03:04.351
Oh, screw Junior League, I quit.

03:04.810 --> 03:07.187
- What?
- They took away my seat on the board.

03:07.270 --> 03:09.981
Said I was out of town too much
to appropriately serve.

03:10.065 --> 03:11.358
That's terrible.

03:11.441 --> 03:13.485
- It's "momist" is what it is.
- That's what it is.

03:14.027 --> 03:15.570
- "Momist"?
- Mmm.

03:15.654 --> 03:19.116
Discriminatory against working moms.
Some of us can't stay at home.

03:19.616 --> 03:22.202
I'm saving babies
and they're making me feel less than.

03:22.285 --> 03:23.120
Less than.

03:23.203 --> 03:24.955
Well, screw those momist bitches.

03:25.038 --> 03:29.292
We should start our own
service organization <i> for</i> working moms.

03:29.459 --> 03:31.878
Um, you don't have a job.

03:31.962 --> 03:33.964
Uh, well, I do now.

03:34.047 --> 03:36.341
Standing up for working moms everywhere.

03:36.883 --> 03:37.759
What do you think?

03:37.843 --> 03:38.844
I don't know.

03:38.927 --> 03:41.179
Starting a new organization
is a ton of work,

03:41.263 --> 03:42.889
and I'm so busy with my job as it is.

03:42.973 --> 03:44.725
I have a lot of free time.

03:44.808 --> 03:46.435
I can do all the heavy lifting.

03:46.518 --> 03:49.896
Okay, I mean, we women
have to support each other.

03:49.980 --> 03:50.814
Mmm.

03:50.897 --> 03:55.986
Well, I do like the idea of creating
a community of like-minded people.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.112
Right?

03:57.195 --> 03:59.531
- That's my girl.
- Yeah. All right, let's do it.

03:59.614 --> 04:00.449
Ooh!

04:00.574 --> 04:03.410
But, we will need a kickoff event.

04:03.910 --> 04:05.579
How about a pageant?

04:05.954 --> 04:10.167
<i>Maybe Patty could qualify for
Miss Magic Jesus after all.</i>

04:14.212 --> 04:17.548
I'll call the golf course,
see when they have availability to host.

04:17.632 --> 04:20.927
Only two weeks left to qualify.

04:21.219 --> 04:23.221
Maybe... Maybe this weekend?

04:23.597 --> 04:26.433
That's not a lot of time to plan.

04:26.975 --> 04:28.477
No, I can plan it.

04:28.560 --> 04:30.937
I'll hire an event planner.
We just need a theme.

04:36.860 --> 04:38.612
Come on!

04:39.821 --> 04:41.448
How about a mother-daughter pageant?

04:42.032 --> 04:43.366
- No.
- Why not?

04:43.450 --> 04:47.120
I can spend quality time with my daughter,
and it's on message.

04:47.496 --> 04:52.125
<i>Because Patty's mom is a disaster.
She'd never win.</i>

04:52.334 --> 04:56.588
Our daughter is a marine in Iraq,
so she won't be here,

04:56.671 --> 05:01.176
so maybe we can pick something
that like I could participate in too.

05:02.552 --> 05:05.847
Moms come in many forms.

05:05.931 --> 05:07.766
It could be symbolic.

05:07.849 --> 05:10.352
Like a role model. I like it.

05:10.894 --> 05:14.856
You can find someone
who is like a daughter,

05:14.940 --> 05:16.525
like Pat... Patty.

05:23.824 --> 05:24.866
- Oh, God.
- Careful now.

05:26.326 --> 05:27.410
Oh!

05:27.494 --> 05:28.870
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, Bob!

05:31.790 --> 05:34.876
Bob wants you to do
a mother-daughter pageant with his wife?

05:35.502 --> 05:36.837
She's not your mom.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.171
It's symbolic.

05:38.797 --> 05:42.342
Plus, if we win,
I get to qualify for Miss Magic Jesus.

05:43.218 --> 05:47.097
Wait, you're telling me Bob suddenly
made up a pageant and if you win it,

05:47.180 --> 05:48.849
you can just qualify?

05:48.932 --> 05:49.975
That's ridiculous.

05:50.058 --> 05:52.394
The rules are pretty lax
for local pageants.

05:52.477 --> 05:55.355
It gets tougher with the bigger pageants,
like regionals or state,

05:55.438 --> 05:59.109
but to qualify for Miss Magic Jesus,
all I have to do is win any pageant.

05:59.192 --> 06:02.279
Which means if I win mother-daughter,
boom, qualified.

06:02.362 --> 06:03.196
Simple.

06:03.280 --> 06:04.114
Sure.

06:04.197 --> 06:07.158
Except for the fact that you're trying
to blow up Coralee and Bob's marriage.

06:07.576 --> 06:08.660
That's what makes it so fun.

06:09.202 --> 06:11.872
If you give Coralee the necklace
from Stella Rose,

06:11.955 --> 06:14.165
she'll hate you, leave Bob,

06:14.249 --> 06:17.377
and ruin any chance you have
of winning the pageant.

06:17.460 --> 06:21.339
So, poof, there goes Miss Magic Jesus.

06:21.882 --> 06:22.883
Crap.

06:23.550 --> 06:25.385
Pageant first, then necklace.

06:25.468 --> 06:27.304
Plus, if I do the pageant first,

06:27.387 --> 06:29.931
I can get close to Coralee
and find out what Bob likes in a woman.

06:30.265 --> 06:32.893
Like Drew Barrymore did
with Tom Skerritt in <i>Poison Ivy.</i>

06:33.351 --> 06:35.729
Patty, I'm home.

06:35.812 --> 06:38.023
When did your mom get back
from her AA retreat?

06:38.106 --> 06:41.276
Just now, apparently.
I haven't heard from her in a week.

06:42.903 --> 06:45.780
My retreat was amazing.

06:46.114 --> 06:51.077
It's like...
It's like taking a bath in Corgi puppies.

06:51.369 --> 06:55.498
I feel so Zen, just like I'm floating.

06:55.582 --> 06:56.875
Good for you.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.294
I gotta go.

07:00.170 --> 07:01.046
Well, where?

07:01.463 --> 07:02.756
Since when do you care?

07:03.590 --> 07:05.550
Well...

07:06.384 --> 07:09.554
Patty? Come on, what the hell
is that supposed to mean?

07:09.638 --> 07:12.349
It means you've been gone for days
and I needed you.

07:13.308 --> 07:16.561
I was taking care of me so I could
take care of you, be a better mom.

07:16.645 --> 07:19.689
Oh, great parenting.
You left me with no way to reach you.

07:20.065 --> 07:23.610
You left me $20 for pizza.
That lasted me exactly half a day.

07:23.693 --> 07:26.112
You missed my first day of school,
and you missed me in crisis.

07:26.196 --> 07:27.656
Well, what happened?

07:28.740 --> 07:31.618
Don't worry about it.
Bob Armstrong took care of it.

07:34.037 --> 07:35.872
I told you to stay away from him.

07:35.956 --> 07:38.500
Good thing I didn't.
Without Bob, I'd be up shit's creek.

07:39.084 --> 07:41.211
Patty. Language.

07:41.294 --> 07:45.799
'Cause us Bladell girls are so high-class.
Nice shirt, I can see your nipples.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.719
- Oh, shit, I left my bra in the park.
- I've gotta go.

07:49.803 --> 07:52.097
Bob is coaching me
for a mother-daughter pageant.

07:52.180 --> 07:54.140
We're raising money for working moms.

07:54.224 --> 07:56.643
That's nice.
At least we can do that together.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.270
I'm doing it with Bob's wife, Coralee.

08:01.398 --> 08:03.775
But, Patty, I'm your mom.

08:03.858 --> 08:05.110
You could have fooled me.

08:10.657 --> 08:13.994
There has got to be someone else
who can do the pageant with me.

08:14.077 --> 08:17.539
Who? Your niece with
the hickey-goes-here tattoo?

08:17.622 --> 08:20.166
Think about it.
You and Patty are a lot alike.

08:20.250 --> 08:22.168
I wish you would stop saying that.

08:22.252 --> 08:24.879
You have more in common with Patty
than you do with our own daughter.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.550
Cat is a marine.

08:29.676 --> 08:32.095
She hasn't had a facial in, well, ever.

08:32.178 --> 08:37.433
Plus, Patty is hungry and fashionable
and she comes from humble roots.

08:39.727 --> 08:42.147
For the record, I know what you're up to.

08:42.230 --> 08:45.233
Okay? You're not doing this for me,
you're doing this for Patty.

08:45.316 --> 08:48.445
No, trust me, Patty is your best option.

08:48.778 --> 08:50.989
Unless you want to give Etta Mae
the spotlight.

08:53.283 --> 08:54.868
How long have you guys been married?

08:55.452 --> 08:56.494
Twenty-one years.

08:57.662 --> 09:00.373
How'd you meet? What was he wearing?
He always been this funny and charming?

09:00.457 --> 09:01.708
Was it love at first sight?

09:04.252 --> 09:06.755
Coralee, work with me here.

09:06.838 --> 09:09.215
The two of you have to get
to know each other better,

09:09.299 --> 09:10.967
that's why she's asking you questions.

09:11.051 --> 09:12.969
She's only asking about you.

09:13.053 --> 09:19.059
It is a mother-daughter pageant.
There is no bond more sacred.

09:19.267 --> 09:22.520
So, for the interview,
we have to convince the judge

09:22.604 --> 09:25.899
that you two are as close as if
Patty had actually come out of your...

09:25.982 --> 09:28.401
All right, that's imagery
I don't need right now.

09:28.485 --> 09:30.320
I definitely don't want
to think about that.

09:30.403 --> 09:34.157
See? The two of you.
Finding common ground already.

09:34.908 --> 09:39.329
The mother-daughter connection,
it goes beyond biology.

09:39.412 --> 09:44.292
It is a soul connection
which can take many forms

09:44.375 --> 09:48.004
and that is the angle
that could get you a win.

09:48.338 --> 09:50.006
But I don't want to win.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.382
Wait, what?

09:51.466 --> 09:53.927
I'm trying to stay
in Etta Mae's good graces.

09:54.010 --> 09:56.888
She is not in the Junior League anymore,
so why do you care?

09:56.971 --> 09:59.015
Because she is a force of nature.

09:59.390 --> 10:02.143
And everything she touches turns to gold.

10:02.227 --> 10:05.688
We are gonna start an organization
that could rival the Junior League.

10:05.772 --> 10:08.441
I want to be her partner,
not her competition.

10:08.525 --> 10:11.194
You are thinking about this all wrong.

10:11.945 --> 10:15.615
You play your cards right,
you and Etta Mae are peers.

10:16.157 --> 10:19.869
But if you lose,
she's just gonna think you're a loser.

10:20.912 --> 10:23.581
And that's what you've been fighting
your entire life.

10:25.500 --> 10:26.417
You're right.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.336
You are totally right.

10:32.173 --> 10:33.383
Oh, my God!

10:33.466 --> 10:36.719
You just coached me
so I would help you and Patty win.

10:38.054 --> 10:39.139
Fine.

10:39.222 --> 10:42.016
Now we just need to rustle up some other
mother-daughters for you two to beat.

10:42.100 --> 10:44.352
Oh, there will be plenty at
Back to School night.

10:45.395 --> 10:48.148
I will get started on the flyers.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.194
Is that the flyer for the pageant?
Because I was thinking...

10:53.278 --> 10:55.029
We've got bigger problems.

11:00.535 --> 11:03.246
Of course I'm not sleeping with
Regina Sinclair.

11:04.247 --> 11:08.334
Brick, I grew you inside my body.
I can tell when you're lying.

11:14.382 --> 11:15.258
Well...

11:16.551 --> 11:17.468
not anymore.

11:19.345 --> 11:21.431
I am a failed mother.

11:21.514 --> 11:27.103
How could you have sex with Regina?
She accused me of molestation.

11:27.187 --> 11:28.396
Seriously?

11:28.479 --> 11:31.774
Our son's been raped,
and you can only think about yourself?

11:31.858 --> 11:33.860
It wasn't rape. I said, "Yes."

11:34.903 --> 11:36.070
Multiple times.

11:36.154 --> 11:40.533
- That is disgusting.
- No, it's not. Older chicks are hot.

11:40.950 --> 11:43.036
I have like seven friends
who totally have a thing for you.

11:43.119 --> 11:43.953
Really?

11:45.580 --> 11:46.748
Which ones?

11:47.832 --> 11:49.042
Can we drop this?

11:50.084 --> 11:53.504
I'm back together with Magnolia,
and if this gets out, that's ruined.

11:53.838 --> 11:56.299
Well, you're staying home from
Back to School night.

11:56.382 --> 11:59.636
Okay? I don't want you
anywhere near Regina Sinclair.

12:01.179 --> 12:02.430
What do you want to do?

12:02.513 --> 12:03.765
I'm not sure.

12:04.182 --> 12:07.310
But Regina Sinclair is going down.

12:11.439 --> 12:14.275
- Bob Armstrong is going down.
- Thank you.

12:14.359 --> 12:17.403
I tried. I even followed him to Alabama.

12:17.820 --> 12:19.489
I just got a little...

12:20.531 --> 12:21.616
distracted.

12:21.991 --> 12:23.409
We need a new plan.

12:23.493 --> 12:25.787
Are we still trying to take Bob down
for fake molesting me?

12:25.870 --> 12:29.165
Oh, no.
This started long before Miss Salty Grits.

12:29.249 --> 12:30.875
I'll tell you when you're older.

12:30.959 --> 12:31.918
I'm confused.

12:32.001 --> 12:34.879
I know, baby. It's 'cause you were
malnourished in China.

12:34.963 --> 12:38.174
Mother-daughter pageant.
Contestants needed.

12:38.258 --> 12:41.469
Show off your talents,
spend quality time with your kid.

12:41.928 --> 12:43.429
Mother-daughter pageant?

12:43.513 --> 12:47.892
It is a kickoff event for Coralee's
new service organization, WMBS.

12:47.976 --> 12:52.397
It's pronounced "wombs."
Working Mother's Benevolent Society.

12:52.647 --> 12:55.066
- I'm a working mom.
- Town shrew doesn't count.

12:55.441 --> 12:58.945
I sell real estate.
I'm on benches all over town.

12:59.028 --> 13:01.322
Ooh, I do remember sitting on your face.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.202
I'm doing the pageant. With Dixie.

13:06.286 --> 13:09.455
And we're gonna win... now that
we don't have you holding us back.

13:10.290 --> 13:11.207
Bye.

13:11.457 --> 13:14.210
Ooh, I want to punch her
in her bench face.

13:14.294 --> 13:16.170
Don't worry, I have a plan.

13:17.046 --> 13:18.715
- I'm all out of flyers.
- Aww!

13:20.883 --> 13:24.262
Go talk to her
and find some more common ground.

13:24.679 --> 13:27.265
- Bob. Okay. Okay.
- Hmm? Hmm?

13:29.475 --> 13:30.351
Hi.

13:31.394 --> 13:34.147
So are you here with your dad?

13:35.523 --> 13:36.399
What dad?

13:37.275 --> 13:38.693
Oh, I'm sorry.

13:38.776 --> 13:41.904
I just figured because you and I
are doing the pageant together,

13:41.988 --> 13:44.198
that your own mom isn't in the picture.

13:44.282 --> 13:46.242
I mean, she is, but just barely.

13:47.660 --> 13:51.205
Well, my mom doesn't know who my dad is.

13:51.622 --> 13:53.291
I was conceived in a blackout.

13:53.374 --> 13:54.667
Boilermakers, yay.

13:56.294 --> 13:57.378
Oh, no.

13:57.462 --> 13:59.714
- No, it's okay. Don't feel bad for me.
- Etta Mae?

14:04.177 --> 14:07.638
We can't let Regina anywhere near WMBS.
She is dangerous.

14:07.722 --> 14:08.848
Exactly.

14:09.223 --> 14:10.725
We have got to be careful.

14:11.059 --> 14:13.102
It's not a good political move
to shut her out.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.898
At least this way we get
to kick Regina and Dixie's asses.

14:20.401 --> 14:22.695
- Oh, I am so glad you're home.
- Aww.

14:22.820 --> 14:25.365
I can't remember the last time
you came to Back to School night.

14:25.448 --> 14:26.908
Oh!

14:29.911 --> 14:31.371
- Go.
- What? Go?

14:31.454 --> 14:32.580
No. No go.

14:32.872 --> 14:35.208
She can't do whatever she wants
'cause you're never here.

14:35.291 --> 14:38.378
I don't want to. Okay?
All he ever wants to do is hook up.

14:38.461 --> 14:39.629
Magnolia Barnard.

14:39.712 --> 14:42.256
Besides, we never get any time together.

14:43.132 --> 14:46.219
Hey, my favorite family.

14:46.511 --> 14:48.638
How we doing on recruits for the pageant?

14:48.721 --> 14:51.891
Amazing. We have nine
mother-daughter teams already.

14:51.974 --> 14:53.643
Everyone is so excited.

14:53.726 --> 14:56.354
Etta Mae wants me to MC.

14:56.729 --> 14:59.524
You? But... pageants are my thing.

14:59.607 --> 15:00.483
Well.

15:00.817 --> 15:03.361
Oh, well, why don't the two of you
do it together?

15:03.444 --> 15:05.822
I'm sure my Bob
won't mind sharing the spotlight.

15:06.406 --> 15:09.617
Now if you'll excuse me, I have
to go pass out the rest of these flyers.

15:12.036 --> 15:14.580
I got your voicemail earlier.
What'd you want to talk to me about?

15:14.664 --> 15:18.084
I need your professional opinion as a DA.
Cone of silence?

15:18.501 --> 15:19.335
It's code.

15:19.877 --> 15:21.546
- It's cone.
- Code.

15:22.213 --> 15:24.132
Doesn't matter. Can you keep a secret?

15:25.716 --> 15:28.261
I might be personally involved in a case
coming your way,

15:28.344 --> 15:31.013
but I want complete control
over how the arrest goes down.

15:31.097 --> 15:34.392
- Any chance you can help me out with that?
- We shouldn't be talking about this here.

15:34.642 --> 15:35.935
- Yeah?
- My house tomorrow?

15:36.018 --> 15:38.688
We can also brainstorm ideas
for our opening number.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.358
Are you a working mom?

15:42.984 --> 15:44.527
I am... excuse me.

15:44.610 --> 15:47.488
I am spending the day tomorrow
with Bob Barnard.

15:47.572 --> 15:51.159
We are MCing the pageant together
and we have to talk about the act.

15:51.242 --> 15:53.870
I swear to God, Bob, if you embarrass me...

15:53.953 --> 15:56.164
No, you should go grab some lunch.

15:56.247 --> 15:58.166
Something healthy like a salad.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.544
You have to bond with her
if you want to win.

16:01.627 --> 16:04.213
Are you serious about WMBS or not?

16:04.964 --> 16:07.258
It's pronounced "wombs."

16:09.886 --> 16:11.888
Hey, listen, it's okay.
You don't have to...

16:11.971 --> 16:13.848
Screw salads. And Bob.

16:14.599 --> 16:18.311
Junk food brunch tomorrow?
I've had a real hankering for Wiener Taco.

16:19.103 --> 16:20.480
No way, my mom works there.

16:20.563 --> 16:23.191
Well, that's even better.
I'd love to meet her.

16:32.658 --> 16:34.076
Oh, hey, traitor.

16:34.619 --> 16:36.954
Patty! Yeah, I'm talking to you.

16:37.246 --> 16:41.417
Or shall I call you "The Artist
Formerly Known As My Daughter"?

16:42.335 --> 16:43.169
We should leave.

16:43.252 --> 16:46.506
Not without my wiener taco.
Do you like 'em soft or hard?

16:46.964 --> 16:53.554
Hello. Can I get, um, four hard wieners
and a side order of wet tots, please?

16:54.263 --> 16:55.598
Four hards, side of wet.

16:55.681 --> 16:57.183
- Okay.
- Anything else?

16:57.266 --> 17:00.645
We got some sporks back there if you
want to stab me in the back some more.

17:00.728 --> 17:02.355
Sporks don't stab, they scoop.

17:02.605 --> 17:05.273
Okay, you know,
this doesn't have to be awkward.

17:05.358 --> 17:08.944
Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Coralee Armstrong, pleasure.

17:09.654 --> 17:11.906
Well, shit in my mouth.

17:12.490 --> 17:14.407
I knew you looked familiar.

17:14.742 --> 17:16.577
Coralee Huggins.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.622
I'm sorry, do I know you?

17:19.704 --> 17:21.582
She's your mom upgrade?

17:21.832 --> 17:24.544
She grew up in the trailer next to me.

17:24.627 --> 17:25.545
I did not.

17:25.962 --> 17:27.128
Don't trust her, Patty.

17:27.213 --> 17:29.840
She bailed on her very own family.

17:29.924 --> 17:33.010
- Hey, you're holding up the line.
- It's just a hot dog in a taco shell.

17:33.094 --> 17:34.053
Keep your pants on.

17:35.429 --> 17:39.267
Look at you,
raising money for working moms

17:39.350 --> 17:41.352
when you never worked a day in your life.

17:41.435 --> 17:42.436
Okay, Mom, that's enough.

17:42.520 --> 17:46.983
I work every single day of my life
on myself.

17:47.066 --> 17:49.610
And that's the hardest work of all,
thank you very much.

17:50.111 --> 17:51.821
Self-help is for rich people.

17:52.572 --> 17:54.574
- Thank you.
- You know, I got news for you, Patty.

17:54.657 --> 17:58.244
You think these pageants are gonna
make you happy, but they're not.

17:58.327 --> 18:00.580
- You don't know that.
- Actually, I do.

18:00.663 --> 18:03.374
I used to be like you.
I used to think if I was pretty enough,

18:03.457 --> 18:06.919
someone would come along
and swoop me up and save me too.

18:07.003 --> 18:10.047
Someone like Bob or Coralee Huggins.

18:10.506 --> 18:11.674
And guess what?

18:12.550 --> 18:18.806
I ended up pregnant, abandoned,
and working in a Wiener Taco.

18:19.849 --> 18:21.934
Don't get your hopes up, Patty.

18:22.018 --> 18:24.312
Bladell women never win.

18:24.895 --> 18:26.188
They get screwed.

18:27.148 --> 18:29.025
Enjoy your wiener tacos.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.486
Patty. She means well.

18:32.570 --> 18:35.948
She's just looking out for you
in her own misguided, alcoholic way.

18:36.032 --> 18:37.033
Stop defending her.

18:38.242 --> 18:41.495
Everything she does is about her.
She always makes it about her,

18:41.579 --> 18:43.623
and what she went through.
What about me?

18:43.956 --> 18:48.377
She fucked me up and now she's telling me
that there's nothing I can do about it?

18:48.461 --> 18:49.670
I hate her.

18:52.381 --> 18:54.967
I want to show you something.
Come with me.

19:11.275 --> 19:14.654
<i>For the first time,
Barnard was actually helpful.</i>

19:14.737 --> 19:19.075
<i>Thanks to him, I'd be able
to handle Regina with style.</i>

19:19.283 --> 19:22.662
<i>Hopefully, our opening number
would be equally tasteful.</i>

19:23.037 --> 19:27.333
I think we descend on silks.

19:27.416 --> 19:28.417
Too gay.

19:28.876 --> 19:32.588
I'm telling you, we sing
the title song from <i>Dirty Dancing,</i>

19:32.922 --> 19:34.215
"The Time of My Life."

19:34.298 --> 19:37.927
What does "The Time of My Life"
have to do with mothers and daughters?

19:38.219 --> 19:40.638
The moms are in one time of their life.

19:40.721 --> 19:43.224
The daughters are in
another time of their life.

19:43.307 --> 19:46.727
Together, they're having
the time of their lives.

19:47.395 --> 19:49.480
Besides, it's Etta Mae
and Magnolia's favorite movie.

19:49.563 --> 19:50.481
They think it's genius.

19:50.564 --> 19:53.526
Now, I'll sing the beginning,
and then you sing the girl part.

19:54.193 --> 19:56.737
The girl part? I want to do the lift.

19:56.821 --> 19:58.823
- You want to be Jennifer Grey?
- Yeah... No.

19:58.906 --> 20:01.158
I will lift you over my head.

20:01.659 --> 20:04.829
Everyone will be talking about it
for months.

20:08.457 --> 20:11.335
I work out twice a day, every day.

20:11.419 --> 20:13.587
Obviously, I'm Patrick Swayze.

20:18.426 --> 20:21.762
Nobody puts Bobby in a corner.

20:23.013 --> 20:25.266
Well, there's only one way to decide this.

20:26.892 --> 20:28.936
<i>I couldn't let Barnard show me up.</i>

20:29.603 --> 20:31.480
<i>Now was my time to shine.</i>

20:34.358 --> 20:35.443
You run to me.

20:35.526 --> 20:36.819
No. You run to me.

20:36.902 --> 20:38.028
No, you run to me.

20:42.408 --> 20:43.284
You done?

20:44.118 --> 20:45.035
Fine.

20:45.703 --> 20:47.955
Jennifer Grey
gets all the attention anyway.

20:48.038 --> 20:50.166
All right. Now, come on, just run.

20:52.001 --> 20:53.794
And... jump.

20:56.630 --> 20:57.965
I'm not gonna drop you.

20:58.048 --> 20:59.842
Why not? You're so good at it.

21:00.384 --> 21:01.761
What is that supposed to mean?

21:02.428 --> 21:03.429
Nothing.

21:03.512 --> 21:04.346
Something.

21:04.430 --> 21:06.140
Just... forget it.

21:06.223 --> 21:07.183
Bob!

21:08.559 --> 21:09.727
Tell me, I want to know.

21:13.564 --> 21:17.651
Fine. We were friends in eighth grade,
and then the minute we got to high school,

21:17.735 --> 21:18.736
you dropped me.

21:19.403 --> 21:22.615
You were too busy being
the captain of the wrestling team,

21:22.698 --> 21:26.494
and the homecoming king, and assistant
co-chair of the yearbook committee.

21:26.577 --> 21:30.623
I didn't even get invited
to your post-graduation kegger.

21:32.708 --> 21:34.210
I'm sorry.

21:34.710 --> 21:36.587
You have no idea what it's like

21:36.670 --> 21:39.006
to be on the outside looking in.

21:39.298 --> 21:41.383
Hey, babe. Magnolia.

21:42.843 --> 21:43.719
Hi, ladies.

21:44.470 --> 21:46.514
What are the two of you doing?

21:46.597 --> 21:48.599
Uh, working on our opening number.

21:48.682 --> 21:51.727
Hey, I had an idea
for your talent for the pageant.

21:51.811 --> 21:55.773
Instead of a Broadway number,
you can throw scalpels,

21:55.856 --> 21:58.108
'cause you're a doctor.
I found a knife wheel on eBay...

21:58.192 --> 22:00.027
That sounds insane.

22:00.110 --> 22:02.363
It's original. You'd definitely win.

22:02.446 --> 22:03.572
Well, who cares?

22:03.656 --> 22:06.158
She already qualified
for Miss Magic Jesus.

22:06.784 --> 22:10.454
Even a single loss
could tarnish her reputation.

22:10.538 --> 22:13.123
- Our reputation as a family.
- Okay. Come on, Mags.

22:13.207 --> 22:15.292
I bought you some new clothes for school.

22:18.462 --> 22:22.091
The second Etta Mae comes into town,
it's like I don't exist.

22:24.009 --> 22:27.763
So trust me, I know what it feels like
to be an outsider.

22:33.227 --> 22:34.687
Let's work on that lift.

22:39.316 --> 22:40.568
Isn't this cute?

22:40.651 --> 22:42.778
I got these for you
when I was in New York.

22:42.862 --> 22:44.238
I hope you like 'em.

22:47.324 --> 22:48.534
Was he serious?

22:49.785 --> 22:51.620
Knife-throwing?

22:51.704 --> 22:54.623
Oh, you know your father.
He sometimes gets carried away.

22:54.707 --> 22:56.959
Well, he's ruining pageants for me.

22:58.002 --> 22:59.587
He's always on my ass.

22:59.670 --> 23:03.007
"Wear this, eat that, smile pretty."

23:03.549 --> 23:05.342
And it's worse when you're gone.

23:05.426 --> 23:06.802
Have you told him how you feel?

23:08.095 --> 23:09.221
Why bother?

23:09.722 --> 23:11.557
You're the only one who listens to me.

23:11.640 --> 23:13.434
You can do anything you want to do,

23:13.517 --> 23:16.145
which also means not doing anything
you don't want to do.

23:17.897 --> 23:20.441
We'll talk to him. Together.

23:23.611 --> 23:25.696
You really did grow up in a trailer park.

23:25.905 --> 23:28.532
How come your trailer looks
so much nicer than all the others?

23:28.616 --> 23:33.495
My daddy was a gardener,
and he specialized in artistic topiary.

23:33.579 --> 23:37.249
I can do it too.
Hearts, poodles, mermaids, you name it.

23:38.250 --> 23:39.543
Oh, my God, you should teach me.

23:39.627 --> 23:41.378
We could do it for our talent
for the pageant.

23:41.837 --> 23:44.548
Oh, I don't know. Don't you think
that'll read a little low-class?

23:46.967 --> 23:49.136
You're ashamed of where you came from.

23:50.137 --> 23:51.680
That's why you lied to my mom.

23:54.308 --> 23:57.770
I tried to leave my past behind me
when I met Bob.

24:00.773 --> 24:07.071
My daddy worked for Bob's family,
and he needed a little extra help

24:07.154 --> 24:11.200
getting the yard in shape
for Bob's law school graduation party.

24:12.785 --> 24:14.495
And that's when I first saw him.

24:20.084 --> 24:23.629
Hey, can you cut the noise?
I'm working on my...

24:33.847 --> 24:35.599
It was love at first sight.

24:38.227 --> 24:41.730
And I knew I was gonna marry that man
from the second I saw him.

24:44.233 --> 24:47.569
When he looked at me,
I felt like he saw me.

24:47.653 --> 24:52.324
Not like the outsides,
but the person inside of me

24:52.741 --> 24:54.702
that I didn't even know was there.

24:56.829 --> 24:58.664
Yeah, I know what you mean.

25:00.124 --> 25:02.251
Bob saw something special in me.

25:04.294 --> 25:10.175
So, if he sees something special in you,
then he must be right.

25:12.886 --> 25:19.101
That's why I wanted to tell you
the truth about my past...

25:21.061 --> 25:23.230
...so you can know what's possible.

25:24.106 --> 25:26.900
You don't have to be screwed
just because your momma was.

25:28.444 --> 25:29.403
Okay?

25:30.112 --> 25:32.531
Don't let anybody get in the way
of your dreams.

25:35.075 --> 25:37.619
<i>In five hours,
Coralee had been more of a mom</i>

25:37.703 --> 25:40.122
<i>than my own mother had been in 17 years.</i>

25:40.998 --> 25:43.459
<i>Maybe I didn't want
to blow up her life after all.</i>

25:47.421 --> 25:50.257
I made special pageant smoothies.

25:50.841 --> 25:52.926
- There you are. All right.
- Thank you.

25:53.886 --> 25:54.928
Hey.

25:55.596 --> 25:58.515
Magnolia doesn't want
to do pageants anymore.

25:58.599 --> 25:59.641
Come on.

26:00.642 --> 26:03.854
- What? Since when?
- Since they stopped being fun.

26:06.231 --> 26:08.734
Well, you're telling me this now?
The pageant is tomorrow.

26:08.817 --> 26:11.236
- She's miserable, Bob.
- Maybe it's because you're never here.

26:11.320 --> 26:14.448
You ever think about that?
If you really cared about her happiness...

26:14.531 --> 26:15.365
Dad, stop.

26:21.622 --> 26:22.790
You gonna get that?

26:30.631 --> 26:32.883
Dr. Barnard.

26:35.135 --> 26:36.678
No, I, uh, can't.

26:37.554 --> 26:39.014
I'm with my daughter.

26:39.098 --> 26:40.015
It's okay.

26:40.599 --> 26:41.934
Do what you gotta do.

26:45.062 --> 26:48.023
Yeah, I'll be there by tonight.

26:49.525 --> 26:50.400
Okay.

26:53.529 --> 26:54.905
I am so sorry.

26:55.114 --> 26:58.617
Don't be.
You're setting a good example.

26:59.159 --> 27:00.786
That a woman can have it all.

27:01.537 --> 27:02.704
Except I can't.

27:03.122 --> 27:06.375
When I'm at work, I miss home,
and when I'm home, I miss work.

27:08.627 --> 27:10.879
Wait, when you're home you miss work?

27:12.798 --> 27:15.801
No, what I mean is,
my work is important to me too,

27:15.884 --> 27:17.427
and it's a balance.

27:18.971 --> 27:21.682
Well, Mom, maybe you're right.

27:23.016 --> 27:24.643
You really <i>can't</i> have it all.

27:26.854 --> 27:28.230
No. Mag...

27:44.329 --> 27:45.455
Get in.

27:45.539 --> 27:48.375
Why the hell would you want to do
a mother-daughter pageant with me?

27:48.458 --> 27:50.586
Because, Patty's doing it
with someone else

27:50.669 --> 27:53.505
and I want her to know
what it feels like to be replaced.

27:53.589 --> 27:55.507
You know you're the parent, right?

27:55.716 --> 27:57.885
I'm the closest thing
you ever had to a mom.

27:58.260 --> 28:01.346
Thanks, Ange.
Real subtle bringing up my dead mom.

28:01.430 --> 28:04.641
I'm just saying.
I've taught you valuable life lessons.

28:04.725 --> 28:05.893
Name one.

28:07.019 --> 28:08.478
How to throw a punch.

28:08.896 --> 28:12.441
And that in New York,
Long Island Iced Tea, it's just iced tea.

28:12.858 --> 28:14.985
And that not everyone looks good
in a romper.

28:16.028 --> 28:18.238
You should write a parenting book. Really.

28:18.989 --> 28:22.201
I'm just saying.
You'd get to sing in public.

28:22.826 --> 28:24.494
Which I know you love.

28:25.204 --> 28:26.788
And it'd be fun.

28:26.872 --> 28:28.624
Get dressed up for the day.

28:28.707 --> 28:30.209
Put on some makeup.

28:30.626 --> 28:32.961
You could be so pretty if you tried.

28:33.754 --> 28:37.299
Eww. You could be really nice
if you weren't such a dick.

28:37.841 --> 28:39.927
I bet Patty'd think you look hot.

28:42.179 --> 28:45.265
- Momma, I'm hot. Why are we working out?
- Oof!

28:45.807 --> 28:48.769
I do my best thinking when I'm sweating.

28:49.686 --> 28:54.024
We need a talent for the pageant.
What are we both good at?

28:56.860 --> 28:59.488
Shooting guns, talking shit.

28:59.571 --> 29:00.864
Sabotage.

29:01.490 --> 29:03.283
Oh, honey.

29:03.367 --> 29:06.995
Oh, I think you just figured out
how we're gonna win!

29:12.334 --> 29:15.170
Excuse me, baby. I'll be back in a minute.

29:16.713 --> 29:18.674
I gotta use the ladies room.

29:21.843 --> 29:22.678
Ooh!

29:23.178 --> 29:25.681
- You smell like a man.
- Beat it, Regina.

29:25.764 --> 29:30.269
Right here in front of everyone? Okay.

29:30.352 --> 29:31.228
Gross.

29:32.646 --> 29:35.315
Don't you miss all this?

29:36.942 --> 29:37.859
No.

29:39.027 --> 29:42.906
What about all... this?

29:43.490 --> 29:44.700
Regina, stop.

29:46.118 --> 29:48.870
I'm back with Magnolia, and if
my parents knew that you were here...

29:48.954 --> 29:52.207
Momma? We gotta go if we want to catch
<i>Little People, Big World.</i>

29:52.291 --> 29:53.667
I'm coming!

29:56.753 --> 29:59.339
When you're done doggy paddling
in the kiddie pool,

29:59.881 --> 30:05.012
and you want to do some...
breaststrokes in the deep end,

30:06.263 --> 30:08.015
you know where to find me.

30:14.980 --> 30:15.981
Okay, let's go.

30:26.783 --> 30:28.869
Are you ready to pop your cherry?

30:28.952 --> 30:31.455
What? It's her first pageant.

30:32.289 --> 30:34.207
Are you excited?

30:34.291 --> 30:37.669
Yeah, and nervous. I didn't realize
there would be so many contestants.

30:37.753 --> 30:40.339
Minus our biggest competition.

30:40.464 --> 30:43.508
Magnolia Barnard
has literally never lost a pageant.

30:43.592 --> 30:45.218
Now that she and Etta Mae
have dropped out,

30:45.302 --> 30:47.054
we have a much better shot.

30:47.137 --> 30:48.096
Okay.

30:48.680 --> 30:49.514
Ow!

30:49.598 --> 30:51.725
- Oh, sorry.
- Mind your bush.

30:52.476 --> 30:53.518
Mom?

30:54.061 --> 30:55.187
What are you doing here?

30:55.270 --> 30:58.482
Oh, well, we're doing
the mother-daughter pageant.

30:58.565 --> 31:01.068
If you can do it without me,
I can do it without you.

31:02.361 --> 31:03.737
Seriously?

31:04.404 --> 31:06.073
I expected this from her, but you?

31:06.156 --> 31:08.617
I'm sorry. She manipulated me.

31:09.159 --> 31:11.578
And you. I can't believe you.

31:11.661 --> 31:14.081
I finally found something that
makes me feel good about myself,

31:14.164 --> 31:18.335
and you decided to become my competition?
When is it my turn?

31:18.418 --> 31:20.962
I was doing pageants
long before you came along, honey.

31:21.046 --> 31:22.255
This isn't about you.

31:22.339 --> 31:23.632
It's never about me.

31:24.132 --> 31:26.927
Every single time in my life
when it should have been about me

31:27.010 --> 31:29.137
getting attention,
you've always made it about you.

31:29.221 --> 31:31.932
On my fifth birthday party,
you had sex with the clown.

31:32.182 --> 31:34.142
You got drunk
at my middle school graduation.

31:34.226 --> 31:36.353
I tried to play soccer and you heckled me.

31:36.436 --> 31:39.189
Yeah, I did.
You run like you got shit in your pants.

31:39.689 --> 31:43.276
And now, you're showing up
trying to steal my spotlight?

31:43.735 --> 31:45.487
What kind of mother
does that to her daughter?

31:46.321 --> 31:47.364
Hey, come on.

31:49.157 --> 31:50.325
- Patt...
- Ladies.

31:56.331 --> 31:57.457
Well, I need a drink.

31:57.791 --> 31:58.917
Angie, don't.

32:00.627 --> 32:01.586
Fine.

32:02.629 --> 32:03.922
I'm gonna go meditate.

32:04.673 --> 32:06.258
You go for a walk or something.

32:18.854 --> 32:21.106
<i>I was furious at my mom.</i>

32:21.648 --> 32:24.067
<i>I wish I had a necklace
to blow up her life.</i>

32:25.402 --> 32:26.903
You gotta shake it off.

32:27.154 --> 32:29.573
We gotta keep you in the zone.

32:33.785 --> 32:37.330
<i>Would the owner
of a red minivan please move your car.</i>

32:37.414 --> 32:39.624
Let's take a walk, clear your head.

32:44.838 --> 32:46.840
Are you seeing what I'm seeing?

32:48.925 --> 32:50.635
- A bunch of bitches?
- No.

32:51.011 --> 32:54.764
Inspiration for sabotage.

32:59.603 --> 33:01.313
Do you think I should quit the pageant?

33:02.564 --> 33:03.899
Why are you asking me?

33:04.232 --> 33:06.193
Because we're friends.

33:07.319 --> 33:10.572
Wait. You think we're friends?

33:11.323 --> 33:13.283
I mean, yeah.

33:13.825 --> 33:15.869
Why else would I have called you?

33:19.664 --> 33:21.291
Yeah, sure.

33:21.833 --> 33:23.502
Cool. Uh...

33:23.960 --> 33:26.213
I've never had a friend
who's a girl before.

33:28.006 --> 33:31.593
Okay. Pros to doing the pageant.

33:33.178 --> 33:35.680
I've never gotten to do
a mother-daughter anything.

33:36.014 --> 33:37.933
My real mom died when I was three.

33:38.558 --> 33:41.978
So, even though Patty's mom
is an extreme mess,

33:42.062 --> 33:44.856
she's also the closest thing
I've ever had to a mom.

33:45.941 --> 33:47.901
And I really want to sing.

33:48.777 --> 33:52.864
Maybe this'll help me understand
why Patty's into all this stuff.

33:52.948 --> 33:54.783
Okay. Cons?

33:56.785 --> 33:58.161
Patty might hate me.

34:00.413 --> 34:02.207
Oh, that's it? One con?

34:05.585 --> 34:07.546
I think you should do it.

34:08.505 --> 34:10.924
You know, go back in and do the pageant.

34:11.507 --> 34:15.679
You've literally just followed Patty
to Alabama to protect her.

34:16.429 --> 34:18.473
You've done her plenty of solids.

34:19.766 --> 34:22.060
Maybe it's time to do one for yourself.

34:29.192 --> 34:30.777
We've been defaced.

34:35.782 --> 34:36.783
What?

34:37.659 --> 34:39.869
- You don't think my mom would have...?
- No.

34:40.328 --> 34:46.001
This is the work of an evil mother who can
spell and her idiot daughter who can't.

34:47.085 --> 34:48.420
Regina and Dixie.

34:48.503 --> 34:49.795
That bitch.

34:49.879 --> 34:53.049
- It's not enough to deflower my so...
- Just focus on winning.

34:53.132 --> 34:54.509
- Okay.
- How?

34:55.092 --> 34:56.219
Without wardrobe...

34:56.303 --> 34:59.848
Patty, bring me my caboodle.

35:04.853 --> 35:06.688
Uh, what are you doing here?

35:07.105 --> 35:10.317
Just because we sucked face in Alabama
does not mean that you can show up here

35:10.400 --> 35:13.111
acting like my boyfriend, because no.

35:13.194 --> 35:15.488
I didn't know you were here.
I'm here for Nonnie.

35:15.572 --> 35:19.075
Good, because we are definitely
not doing it in the bathroom.

35:20.410 --> 35:21.995
This is such a clichÃ©.

35:22.662 --> 35:24.831
We're the only two Asians at school.

35:25.624 --> 35:28.960
I am not Asian. I am adopted.

35:36.509 --> 35:37.844
Thank you very much.

35:39.012 --> 35:43.808
And welcome to the first annual
mother-daughter pageant sponsored by WMBS,

35:44.225 --> 35:46.561
Working Mothers Benevolent Society,

35:46.645 --> 35:49.439
where 100 percent of tonight's proceeds

35:49.522 --> 35:54.110
go to childcare
for working mothers everywhere.

35:55.320 --> 36:00.575
And now, let's say hi
to our illustrious judges.

36:04.996 --> 36:08.583
Now, let's get this show started.

37:22.115 --> 37:24.451
Are you ready for a show? Here we go.

37:24.534 --> 37:25.535
Come on.

37:37.338 --> 37:39.007
<i>The tear-away tux.</i>

37:39.299 --> 37:40.925
<i>The mankini.</i>

37:41.009 --> 37:44.471
<i>He planned to steal the spotlight
all along.</i>

37:44.554 --> 37:46.181
<i>I couldn't trust him.</i>

37:46.431 --> 37:48.933
<i>That dirty effin' dancer.</i>

37:59.986 --> 38:02.071
Okay. Okay.

38:02.655 --> 38:03.656
No.

38:04.365 --> 38:06.201
No. No.

38:06.284 --> 38:08.453
How about we see some people
with their clothes on?

38:08.953 --> 38:13.583
Let's welcome our mother-daughter teams
in their fun fashion wear.

38:14.167 --> 38:15.168
You tricked me.

38:15.710 --> 38:18.171
You can't be mad.
I helped you with the Regina thing.

38:18.588 --> 38:19.672
Even Steven.

38:19.923 --> 38:23.426
And now, here comes our first
mother-daughter pair.

38:23.510 --> 38:26.596
Nonnie Thompson and Angie Bladell.

38:37.190 --> 38:39.901
Regina and Dixie Sinclair.

38:41.903 --> 38:45.114
Uninspired but walking in unison, I guess.

38:49.118 --> 38:53.957
And my personal favorites,
Patty Bladell and Coralee Armstrong.

38:54.040 --> 38:55.583
Oh, making a statement.

38:55.667 --> 38:56.543
Yes.

38:56.626 --> 39:00.588
Taking back the slurs that women are
bombarded with every day is shocking...

39:01.005 --> 39:03.424
and empowering.

39:03.508 --> 39:04.759
Way to go, ladies.

39:04.843 --> 39:09.055
Next up, we have
Jessica and Ashley Johnson.

39:09.138 --> 39:11.432
<i>Since Magnolia and Etta Mae dropped out,</i>

39:11.516 --> 39:14.477
<i>Regina and Dixie
were our main competition.</i>

39:14.769 --> 39:18.439
<i>Patty and Coralee would need
to ace the talent portion to win.</i>

39:18.523 --> 39:22.151
He touched me all down in my hoo.
But I said, "No means no."

39:22.777 --> 39:25.530
Winner, winner, winner.

39:25.947 --> 39:28.867
This one is in the bag.

39:28.950 --> 39:31.995
Oh, my God. You're drunk.

39:32.078 --> 39:34.539
We're on next. I can't go on without you.
I'll be disqualified.

39:34.622 --> 39:37.041
So now you hate me? Patty hates me.

39:37.125 --> 39:38.501
- Come on.
- Let's just go.

39:38.585 --> 39:40.378
- Just get...
- Come on. Come on. Let... Come...

39:40.670 --> 39:44.007
Let's just get you some coffee, yeah?
Angie?

39:44.382 --> 39:45.508
Ang...

39:45.633 --> 39:46.676
Angie?

39:50.513 --> 39:51.556
So that's it?

39:53.016 --> 39:54.225
I can't sing?

39:54.851 --> 39:56.477
<i>I felt badly for her.</i>

39:56.978 --> 39:58.938
<i>But it was winner take all.</i>

39:59.606 --> 40:03.067
<i>Everyone knows pageants are cutthroat.</i>

40:31.638 --> 40:33.222
Did they make a lady biscuit?

40:35.308 --> 40:37.143
It's a Georgia peach, y'all.

40:48.696 --> 40:50.698
What if my dad was right?

40:51.366 --> 40:54.786
You know, what if my mom
doesn't care about me?

40:54.869 --> 40:56.245
I care about you.

40:58.206 --> 41:00.625
I downloaded <i>Dirty Dancing</i> on my laptop.

41:00.708 --> 41:03.586
And I have a bag of
bacon cheddar popcorn and beer.

41:03.962 --> 41:06.798
Aww. All of my favorite things.

41:08.091 --> 41:09.092
What's up?

41:10.343 --> 41:12.720
I wanted to show you
that I'm not all about sex.

41:13.972 --> 41:16.891
That I can do better,
and if you want to talk,

41:17.475 --> 41:18.518
we can...

41:19.852 --> 41:20.728
Shh.

41:22.397 --> 41:23.940
Stop talking.

41:27.568 --> 41:29.862
<i>Patty and Coralee's bushes
were first-rate,</i>

41:29.946 --> 41:31.948
<i>but they were still at a disadvantage.</i>

41:32.031 --> 41:37.704
<i>Dixie and Regina were the only pair with
a bona fide mother-daughter relationship.</i>

41:38.121 --> 41:40.498
Dixie, answer this question.

41:41.082 --> 41:43.292
What does this woman mean to you?

41:46.004 --> 41:48.965
- My momma is a blond angel.
- Aww...

41:49.090 --> 41:52.927
She picked me from the ward
of unwanted babies in China,

41:53.011 --> 41:55.430
where little girls
are often left in ditches.

41:55.513 --> 41:56.639
Thank you.

42:03.980 --> 42:05.773
Found her in a ditch.

42:06.566 --> 42:07.608
Beat that.

42:10.278 --> 42:11.320
It's okay.

42:11.904 --> 42:13.114
I can't do this.

42:13.197 --> 42:14.907
What? Why not?

42:15.324 --> 42:17.618
Because I've known you for,
what, a few days?

42:17.827 --> 42:20.038
How are we gonna convince them
we have a real bond?

42:20.121 --> 42:21.372
Because we do.

42:21.456 --> 42:24.542
Please welcome Coralee Armstrong
and Patty Bladell.

42:24.625 --> 42:26.544
I believe in you, Patty.

42:26.627 --> 42:29.380
Come on. Let's go out there
and win this thing.

42:37.847 --> 42:41.350
Patty, what does this woman mean to you?

42:50.193 --> 42:55.239
My whole life, my real mom told me,
"Bladell women never win."

42:56.282 --> 43:01.079
So, instead of living my dreams,
I ate them.

43:02.455 --> 43:08.377
And the fat became an armor,
protecting me from disappointment.

43:09.670 --> 43:11.255
And then I got skinny,

43:12.340 --> 43:18.638
but I still felt weighed down
by who I was, where I came from.

43:21.182 --> 43:25.645
Then someone came along
who saw something special in me.

43:26.854 --> 43:31.025
And at first, I thought that that person
was just Coralee's husband, Bob...

43:32.193 --> 43:37.532
but Coralee also showed me
that I'm not bound to my past,

43:38.491 --> 43:41.994
that anything is possible
if I believe in myself.

43:43.037 --> 43:47.375
And for the first time,
I think I actually might.

43:49.210 --> 43:53.214
Thank you for loving me
before I could love myself,

43:54.298 --> 43:55.925
like a real mom is supposed to.

44:02.598 --> 44:04.600
You're beautiful, Patty!

44:08.396 --> 44:09.856
Did you really mean all that?

44:10.231 --> 44:11.315
Every word.

44:12.358 --> 44:15.862
<i>It was a mother-daughter miracle.</i>

44:16.112 --> 44:19.407
<i>They had formed a real connection,
and with any luck,</i>

44:19.490 --> 44:22.785
<i>that could turn Patty into a real winner.</i>

44:26.747 --> 44:30.459
And the winners of
the mother-daughter pageant are...

44:32.503 --> 44:36.966
Coralee Armstrong and Patty Bladell!

44:37.049 --> 44:38.092
We did it!

44:38.968 --> 44:40.636
I qualified for Miss Magic Jesus.

44:41.929 --> 44:43.306
Thanks!

44:44.974 --> 44:46.142
Thank you.

44:49.687 --> 44:52.732
No! This pageant is rigged. Ooh!

44:52.815 --> 44:55.818
Bob Armstrong rigged the whole thing.

44:56.277 --> 44:58.821
Wow. She did it again.
You totally called it.

44:59.655 --> 45:01.490
...again and again.

45:01.574 --> 45:06.037
He's just allowed again and again,
like some pesky disease in this community.

45:06.120 --> 45:08.664
Thank you.
I'm glad that you are here, sir.

45:08.748 --> 45:09.707
- Regina Sinclair?
- Yes.

45:09.790 --> 45:11.626
You're under arrest for statutory rape.

45:12.877 --> 45:13.920
What?

45:14.587 --> 45:17.215
Momma? Who did you rape?

45:17.757 --> 45:19.258
- No one!
- Come on, bring her.

45:19.926 --> 45:21.302
Call Grandpa!

45:21.385 --> 45:25.097
Introduce yourself, then tell him
to meet me at the courthouse!

45:35.024 --> 45:38.027
Dixie's mom just got arrested
for sleeping with a kid at school.

45:40.321 --> 45:41.197
Eww!

45:42.198 --> 45:43.741
Who would hook up with her?

45:45.660 --> 45:49.121
<i>I couldn't believe it.
I'd won my first pageant.</i>

45:49.330 --> 45:52.291
<i>It felt like a drug, and I wanted more.</i>

45:52.375 --> 45:55.544
<i>Maybe all my wildest dreams
could come true.</i>

45:55.753 --> 45:58.673
<i>Now that the pageant was over,
I could destroy Bob's marriage</i>

45:58.756 --> 46:00.758
<i>and have him all to myself.</i>

46:00.841 --> 46:03.803
There's my winning mother-daughter team.

46:03.886 --> 46:06.097
Congrats, girls.

46:06.847 --> 46:09.558
<i>Except, I didn't want to anymore.</i>

46:09.642 --> 46:11.519
<i>I loved them both.</i>

46:11.894 --> 46:13.437
I am proud of you.

46:13.771 --> 46:16.607
Thank you. But I couldn't have done it
without Coralee.

46:18.359 --> 46:19.819
Well, there's my winner.

46:20.403 --> 46:21.404
Hey.

46:23.030 --> 46:24.073
I'm sorry.

46:24.949 --> 46:26.951
I wasn't trying to steal your fire.

46:27.034 --> 46:28.119
It's okay.

46:29.287 --> 46:31.080
You looked so beautiful up there.

46:33.374 --> 46:34.542
I'm so proud of you.

46:35.960 --> 46:37.670
We'll give you a minute.

46:41.299 --> 46:44.510
I heard what you said
in your interview... about Coralee.

46:45.720 --> 46:47.513
- I'm sorry.
- Mm-mm.

46:48.597 --> 46:49.682
I'm sorry.

46:50.725 --> 46:52.977
I did some shitty things. You were right.

46:54.020 --> 46:55.980
But it's not because
I don't believe in you.

46:58.190 --> 46:59.775
It's 'cause I was jealous.

47:00.401 --> 47:04.363
Yeah. And that is a crappy thing to feel.

47:07.158 --> 47:08.576
But I want to make it right.

47:10.703 --> 47:14.957
So, if you want to do pageants with Bob...

47:16.250 --> 47:17.668
I won't stand in your way.

47:21.839 --> 47:22.882
Thank you.

47:25.468 --> 47:27.928
For being honest with me.

47:29.472 --> 47:31.766
Yeah, well,
I was full of shit for so long,

47:31.849 --> 47:33.851
I figured I'd try something else.

47:33.934 --> 47:35.061
Yeah.

47:35.144 --> 47:37.188
Oh, come on, we should celebrate. Right?

47:37.813 --> 47:38.773
Right.

47:39.190 --> 47:41.192
Could we maybe invite Coralee?

47:44.153 --> 47:45.071
Sure.

47:46.155 --> 47:47.573
Let's go get her.

47:47.865 --> 47:49.450
It's so heavy, I swear I...

47:49.533 --> 47:52.787
Coralee? My bio mom wants to celebrate.

47:52.870 --> 47:54.747
- She wants you to come.
- Oh!

47:54.872 --> 47:57.208
Coralee, Wiener Taco.

47:57.291 --> 47:59.210
My treat.

47:59.418 --> 48:02.546
Uh, Wiener Taco? That's disgusting.

48:07.301 --> 48:10.221
Sweetie, you know we can't hang out
anymore, right, honey?

48:11.680 --> 48:13.265
What? Why?

48:14.058 --> 48:17.061
Well, getting those ladies to accept me
was all I ever wanted.

48:17.144 --> 48:20.689
And you and your mom,
y'all could really drag me down.

48:21.524 --> 48:22.691
So, that's it?

48:23.109 --> 48:24.485
You're just blowing me off?

48:25.236 --> 48:26.737
It's not about you.

48:30.241 --> 48:31.367
It never is.

48:31.784 --> 48:35.246
<i>She knew how vulnerable I was,
and she abandoned me anyway.</i>

48:36.455 --> 48:38.666
<i>I wanted her to hurt like I hurt.</i>

48:38.749 --> 48:41.919
<i>I wanted her to feel betrayed
like I felt betrayed.</i>

48:42.211 --> 48:44.004
<i>I wanted to light her on fire.</i>

48:44.213 --> 48:46.966
<i>But instead, I threw a grenade.</i>

48:47.049 --> 48:49.969
Coralee, I have something to give you.

48:50.052 --> 48:52.221
But don't worry, it's not about you.

48:54.890 --> 48:57.518
It's a necklace that Bob gave Stella Rose,
who he met,

48:57.601 --> 49:00.104
as you know, while you were married.

49:02.690 --> 49:04.316
I thought you'd want to have it.
