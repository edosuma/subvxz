Brickleberry industrial park

10:56.104 --> 11:00.106
- is the highest on record.
- A scientist is basically a gay wizard.

11:00.192 --> 11:04.144
Scientifically speaking, it's
almost in the dangerous red zone.

11:04.279 --> 11:05.945
What happens if it goes into the red?

11:06.031 --> 11:08.314
We don't really know,
but it won't be good.

11:08.417 --> 11:10.366
Knowingly increasing
your carbon footprint

11:10.485 --> 11:14.070
like Mr. Johnson is doing
is absolutely despicable.

11:14.156 --> 11:17.073
I'm Bill Nye.
This dick tastes so good.

11:17.159 --> 11:19.325
Nummy, nummy.
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

11:21.580 --> 11:24.297
This was the worst day of my life!

11:24.382 --> 11:26.416
This was the best day of my life!

11:26.501 --> 11:29.803
- How was your day, sister Ethel?
- Greatest day ever.

11:29.888 --> 11:32.839
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.
I think we should live here forever.

11:32.974 --> 11:35.341
I really feel at home
among the Aim-ish.

11:35.477 --> 11:36.643
First of all, it's Amish!

11:36.728 --> 11:40.430
Second, your face looks like a
fat turd rolled in orangutan hair.

11:40.515 --> 11:42.482
But at prayer service,
you said I looked like

11:42.567 --> 11:44.484
Abe Lincoln raped carrot top.

11:44.569 --> 11:46.653
I need some alone time!
[sighs]

11:46.738 --> 11:49.689
I guess I'll go read
the bible by candlelight.

11:49.775 --> 11:51.074
Oh.

11:51.193 --> 11:54.093
Ethel, I'm sorry I
mispronounced Am-osh.

11:54.196 --> 11:57.464
- I, uh, hey!
- Connie...!

11:57.566 --> 12:01.668
[gasps]
Is that Happy dappy bird?

12:01.770 --> 12:04.179
How could you do this
after you made me throw away

12:04.180 --> 12:06.589
- all my stuff?
- Living like this was just too hard.

12:06.708 --> 12:07.707
You're a hypocrite,

12:07.793 --> 12:09.876
and you broke the rules
of our Aa-mish people.

12:10.011 --> 12:12.579
- I'm sorry, Connie.
- Sorry?!

12:12.673 --> 12:16.099
Do you know how much it sucks
using a hand-cranked vibrator?

12:16.218 --> 12:18.268
[creaking]

12:18.386 --> 12:19.686
Now if you'll excuse me,

12:19.771 --> 12:22.021
I've got to go pick the
splinters out of my cooch.

12:22.107 --> 12:24.974
I've been pissing
toothpicks since Tuesday!

12:26.795 --> 12:30.129
[Malloy] Every 3 feet.
You know what that means?

12:30.232 --> 12:32.899
- That cows shit a lot?
- It's a sign!

12:32.984 --> 12:35.401
The cows are trying to
communicate something.

12:35.487 --> 12:37.287
What are you, some
kind of conspiracy nut?

12:37.405 --> 12:38.905
These cows are probably
just trying to say

12:39.040 --> 12:40.740
"free psychedelic mushrooms."

12:40.826 --> 12:42.492
You haven't been eating those, have you?

12:42.577 --> 12:44.661
Now what makes you say that?

12:46.748 --> 12:48.373
Okay, Steve, I need some more

12:48.374 --> 12:49.999
important information about the future.

12:50.085 --> 12:52.468
Will I like that
new Adam Sandler movie?

12:52.587 --> 12:54.254
[screaming]

12:54.389 --> 12:55.672
[groans]

12:55.757 --> 12:58.224
You say it's about as
funny as Schindler's List.

12:58.310 --> 13:01.261
Wow! That funny?!
One more, Steve.

13:01.346 --> 13:03.646
Will this chalupa give me the shits?

13:03.765 --> 13:06.349
[screaming]

13:06.434 --> 13:09.402
[laughing maniacally]

13:11.857 --> 13:14.984
This environmental disaster
that could mean the end

13:14.985 --> 13:18.111
for mankind is being blamed
on one man: Woody Johnson.

13:18.196 --> 13:21.695
<i>- Oh, Jim, don't stop.
- [Jim] I can't stop. I'm stuck.</i>

13:24.786 --> 13:27.287
[groaning]

13:27.372 --> 13:30.957
Oh, you're alive.
I'll just save this for later then.

13:31.042 --> 13:33.459
Woody, Ethel was right about everything.

13:33.545 --> 13:36.447
- You've got to shut this place down.
- God, don't tell me

13:36.448 --> 13:39.349
you're going to start with
this global warming horseshit.

13:39.467 --> 13:41.968
Woody, we both know that
I can see the future, right?

13:42.053 --> 13:44.514
- Uh-huh.
- So when a person that can

13:44.516 --> 13:47.390
see the future tells you
that global warming is real,

13:47.475 --> 13:49.025
don't you think you should believe him?

13:49.144 --> 13:51.694
I only believe hard facts,
like pregnant virgins,

13:51.813 --> 13:54.814
- talking snakes, and magical Jews.
- It's simple.

13:54.900 --> 13:58.451
Shut this place down,
or everyone will die!

13:58.536 --> 14:01.154
If you want Woody
Incorporated shut down,

14:01.239 --> 14:03.926
you'll have to kill me first.

14:04.326 --> 14:07.543
Now, future boy,
tell me if you saw this coming.

14:07.662 --> 14:09.829
[screaming]

14:09.965 --> 14:12.165
[phone ringing]

14:12.300 --> 14:15.468
- What's up, Woody?
- Steve, real quick before you go splat,

14:15.570 --> 14:18.388
- will the chalupa give me the shits?
- Yes, it will.

14:18.506 --> 14:20.996
Ah, [bleep] it.
I'm eating it anyway.

14:21.056 --> 14:23.756
[flatulence]
Oh, that was quick.

14:24.345 --> 14:26.445
Denzel, we have to kill Woody.

14:26.547 --> 14:28.447
- Yep.
- Don't you want to know why?

14:28.549 --> 14:30.549
- Nope.
- But I'm no match for Woody.

14:30.684 --> 14:33.352
Steve, you have the ability
to see into the future.

14:33.437 --> 14:36.105
- You're like a superhero!
- That's only when I'm being shocked.

14:36.223 --> 14:37.389
Yeah, well, I guess
it's one in the pee-hole

14:37.475 --> 14:39.424
and two in the b-hole.
Let's get to it.

14:39.527 --> 14:40.793
With electricity.

14:40.895 --> 14:42.594
Oh, then we need to come
up with some new technology,

14:42.696 --> 14:44.029
so you can control your superpower.

14:44.131 --> 14:47.432
A shock collar?
Aren't these for dogs?

14:47.535 --> 14:49.134
Yeah, just bark to activate it.

14:49.236 --> 14:52.437
I thought you said this
would be cool, like Iron Man.

14:52.540 --> 14:54.606
One, Tony Stark is a billionaire.

14:54.708 --> 14:58.443
And two, I'm still high
as [bleep] on mushrooms!

15:00.047 --> 15:03.415
Okay, Ethel, you can do this. 
[grunting]

15:03.551 --> 15:05.834
Screw it!

15:05.920 --> 15:08.720
See? I told you she
was breaking the rules.

15:08.806 --> 15:10.422
What are we gonna do to her, brothers?

15:10.508 --> 15:12.591
Give her extra laundry duty?

15:12.726 --> 15:16.311
Let this be a lesson to all of you.
Technology is evil.

15:16.430 --> 15:19.431
And those of you who use it
must die.

15:19.567 --> 15:21.900
Uh, don't you guys think
this is a little harsh?

15:22.002 --> 15:25.304
No.
And there's only one thing

15:25.305 --> 15:27.272
worse than technology:

15:27.408 --> 15:31.443
- Tattletales.
- God damn it.

15:33.781 --> 15:36.615
You here to kill me, future boy?

15:36.700 --> 15:38.917
Woody, I'm gonna give
you one more chance

15:39.003 --> 15:40.369
to shut this plant down.

15:40.454 --> 15:45.507
Sure. Let me just grab
my shut-down button.

15:45.626 --> 15:48.293
Looking for this?
Give it up.

15:48.379 --> 15:50.846
With this collar,
all I have to do is bark,

15:50.965 --> 15:52.295
and I'll know everything you're

15:52.296 --> 15:54.466
- gonna do before you do it.
- Crap. Really?

15:54.602 --> 15:56.768
Well, what happens next?
Do I beat the shit out of you?

15:56.871 --> 15:58.971
- No.
- I do now.

15:59.056 --> 16:02.975
Ahh!
[barking]

16:03.060 --> 16:05.227
[panting]

16:05.312 --> 16:06.478
Oh, look, over there!

16:06.614 --> 16:09.448
Viggo Mortensen is behind
you sucking himself off.

16:09.533 --> 16:13.018
I know you're lying.
[groans]

16:13.120 --> 16:15.404
I have to look.

16:15.489 --> 16:17.322
[panting]
[action music]

16:17.458 --> 16:18.657
[beeping]

16:25.049 --> 16:27.332
- Whew.
- I knew you'd hide here.

16:27.434 --> 16:29.167
[screaming]

16:29.253 --> 16:32.804
- Quick, take me to the airport!
- So you can fly to Australia

16:32.890 --> 16:35.173
and change your name 
to Rick Swordfire?

16:35.259 --> 16:37.009
Oh, god damn it!

16:37.094 --> 16:39.145
[panting]

16:40.231 --> 16:45.083
- My powers are too much for you, Woody.
- Yeah, but you're still stupid.

16:45.185 --> 16:47.853
[dogs barking]
[screams]

16:49.240 --> 16:52.357
At this rate, we'll starve to death
before we burn to death.

16:52.443 --> 16:56.862
Well, it's been five hours, but...
[blows]

16:56.997 --> 16:59.698
I think I've got it just about start...

16:59.783 --> 17:01.867
[farts]

17:01.952 --> 17:04.036
Sorry. Front fart.

17:04.121 --> 17:05.253
<i>[all] Aww!</i>

17:05.372 --> 17:09.258
Calm down, people.
Stake burnings always take a while.

17:09.376 --> 17:12.928
- Unless you all know a better way.
- I've got a lighter!

17:13.047 --> 17:16.048
- God damn it.
- Connie, I've got an idea.

17:16.183 --> 17:18.583
Reach in my pocket and grab my... whoa!

17:18.685 --> 17:21.386
Phone!
Grab my phone, you idiot.

17:21.521 --> 17:23.939
Oh, I thought you wanted
to go out with a bang.

17:24.058 --> 17:26.892
- A finger ba...
- Yeah, I got it.

17:27.027 --> 17:29.528
Happy dappy bird?

17:29.613 --> 17:33.565
This is evil technology.
It's a... Oh!

17:33.651 --> 17:36.652
Oh, no, watch out for
that pipe, dappy bird.

17:36.737 --> 17:37.869
<i>- Me next!
- Me too!</i>

17:37.955 --> 17:40.405
<i>[all laughing]</i>

17:40.541 --> 17:43.508
Wait. What are we doing?

17:43.610 --> 17:47.079
God damn it.
Who the hell's gonna light all these?

17:49.283 --> 17:51.016
What the hell is all this?

17:51.118 --> 17:54.786
I've had a breakthrough, Denzel.
What do cows eat?

17:54.888 --> 17:56.588
- Grass?
- Grass.

17:56.690 --> 18:01.293
Grassy knoll? 
Cows killed JFK.

18:01.395 --> 18:03.362
Why the hell would a cow
want to kill the president?

18:03.464 --> 18:05.664
Can't you see 
that it's all coming to a head?

18:05.766 --> 18:07.299
They are getting ready for something.

18:07.401 --> 18:09.434
Look at these satellite
photos from all over the world.

18:09.536 --> 18:12.637
Cows are grouping together, organizing,

18:12.740 --> 18:15.688
- forming into some kind of...
- Herd?

18:15.726 --> 18:18.043
I was gonna say clan,
but I'm in mixed company.

18:18.145 --> 18:19.845
All right, I've had
enough of this nonsense.

18:19.947 --> 18:22.681
There's only one way to beat
an irrational fear: Face it.

18:22.783 --> 18:26.118
I'm gonna prove to you that
cows are kind, peaceful animals.

18:26.220 --> 18:27.085
How?

18:27.171 --> 18:31.173
Hey! No! Off!
Ugh! Gross.

18:31.291 --> 18:32.791
See? She likes you.

18:32.926 --> 18:35.460
[Woody panting]

18:39.360 --> 18:40.692
Oh, shit!

18:40.794 --> 18:43.729
You forced me to do this, Woody.
[gun cocks]

18:43.831 --> 18:45.397
Don't do it, Steve.

18:45.499 --> 18:47.766
Woody, where did you hide
my Christmas presents?

18:47.835 --> 18:49.718
They're in the closet, top shelf!

18:49.837 --> 18:51.670
- Fire away, Steve.
- Yeah, Steve.

18:51.755 --> 18:53.555
This thing you told me to
watch but I forgot to watch

18:53.674 --> 18:56.133
is almost in the red.
[gun cocks]

19:01.849 --> 19:03.482
[cow farts]

19:03.567 --> 19:04.850
[ding]

19:04.935 --> 19:06.101
Oh, shit.

19:06.186 --> 19:09.154
[wind blowing]

19:10.491 --> 19:12.357
You see?
 Nothing happened.

19:12.493 --> 19:14.860
[rumbling]

19:21.118 --> 19:24.770
Hands up, humans.
[guns powering up]

19:24.872 --> 19:26.699
What did I tell you?

19:29.024 --> 19:30.807
You see, thousands of years ago,

19:30.892 --> 19:33.559
we sent a small group of
our kind to this planet.

19:33.645 --> 19:36.396
Their mission was to rectally
release greenhouse gases

19:36.531 --> 19:39.649
and raise them to a level
that our kind can thrive in.

19:39.734 --> 19:41.734
Okay, is anyone else seeing this shit?

19:41.870 --> 19:45.371
We estimated that it would
take another 71 million years,

19:45.473 --> 19:50.443
but thanks to this idiot,
we'll be taking over today.

19:50.545 --> 19:54.113
B-B-But we can live together
in peace and harmony, right?

19:54.215 --> 19:56.082
Sure. That's the plan.

19:56.167 --> 19:57.300
<i>Moo. Moo moo moo moo moo.</i>

19:57.419 --> 19:58.885
They've been eating you?

19:58.970 --> 20:00.353
<i>Moo. Moo moo.
Moo moo moo moo moo.</i>

20:00.455 --> 20:02.722
Yanking on your teats?

20:02.824 --> 20:04.324
<i>Moo. Moo moo 
moo moo moo. Moo.</i>

20:04.426 --> 20:06.893
But you're cool with India?
Got it.

20:06.978 --> 20:10.647
Well, so much for peace and harmony.

20:10.765 --> 20:12.098
[screaming]

20:12.183 --> 20:13.867
Woody!

20:14.152 --> 20:17.058
Thank god we're home.
We'll be safe here.

20:17.723 --> 20:20.157
Yeah, we got those
motherfuckers, didn't we?

20:20.494 --> 20:23.358
Denzel! Nooo!

20:26.240 --> 20:28.750
Thank god.
It was all a dream.

20:28.785 --> 20:32.286
I must went into a coma when I got
electrocuted on that transformer.

20:32.321 --> 20:33.772
Oh, you're awake.

20:33.807 --> 20:35.981
Just in time to go
into human's livery.

20:36.016 --> 20:38.506
We'll take it from here, Dr. Moosniak.

20:38.541 --> 20:41.047
No. No, no, nooo!

20:41.659 --> 20:45.010
[tense music]

20:45.869 --> 20:49.114
[cows cheering]
This is awesome!
