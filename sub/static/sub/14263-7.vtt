22:55.339 --> 22:56.874
Hah! Yeah, sure.
Why not?

22:58.376 --> 23:02.379
Man! How could you think
that android was really me?
Well, let's see.

23:02.446 --> 23:04.181
It looked like you,
it talked like you,

23:04.249 --> 23:07.350
and it responded
to the name Carter
by shooting at us.

23:07.418 --> 23:09.419
But you know
I'd never do that.

23:09.487 --> 23:12.021
Besides, if I was really
gonna get you guys,

23:12.089 --> 23:14.725
there wouldn't be a single
sorry scrap of shell left.

23:14.792 --> 23:16.292
Hey, hey, hey!

23:16.361 --> 23:18.962
If you were gonna get us,
you'd be in worse shape
than that android.

23:19.029 --> 23:21.331
Guys, what are you
arguing about?

23:21.399 --> 23:23.367
We all know
there's only one Carter.

23:23.434 --> 23:26.737
[ Raphael ]
Yeah, and one is plenty.
