WEBVTT

00:01.202 --> 00:02.235
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 All right, let's do this.

00:02.270 --> 00:03.137
Jane was accidentally
 artificially inseminated

00:03.171 --> 00:05.439
with Rafael's sperm,
 and from there

00:05.473 --> 00:07.708
things got really crazy.

00:07.741 --> 00:09.777
See, they fell in love
 and then broke up.

00:09.810 --> 00:11.679
Oh, and Rafael's ex-wife,
 Petra,

00:11.712 --> 00:13.281
intentionally
 inseminated herself

00:13.314 --> 00:15.183
because she still loves Rafael,

00:15.216 --> 00:16.584
and they've been
 getting closer.

00:16.617 --> 00:18.186
I know, straight out
 of a telenovela, right?

00:18.219 --> 00:20.188
(screams)
 Well, imagine this:

00:20.221 --> 00:22.423
We have not one, but two
 crime lords on the loose.

00:22.456 --> 00:24.725
First, Rose aka Sin Rostro

00:24.758 --> 00:26.127
aka Luisa's great love.

00:26.160 --> 00:28.062
LUISA:
 Do you remember

00:28.096 --> 00:29.663
what we got that first time
 that we were together?

00:29.697 --> 00:32.133
Powdered donuts
from the vending machine.

00:32.165 --> 00:33.167
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And Rafael has just learned

00:33.201 --> 00:35.269
that his mother, Elena,
 is the international

00:35.303 --> 00:36.670
crime boss known as Mutter.

00:36.704 --> 00:39.307
And they were both fighting
 over this chip.

00:39.340 --> 00:40.674
Do you even want to know
what's on the chip inside?

00:40.708 --> 00:43.144
All of the faces
 Sin Rostro changed.

00:43.177 --> 00:44.145
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And as for our Jane,

00:44.178 --> 00:46.147
well, she's trying
 to juggle being a mommy

00:46.180 --> 00:48.549
with her dreams of
 becoming a writer of romance.

00:48.582 --> 00:50.284
So, she enrolled
 in grad school and was studying

00:50.318 --> 00:52.420
under Professor
 Jonathan Chavez,

00:52.453 --> 00:55.423
who she might've just had
 a sexy dream about,

00:55.456 --> 00:57.057
so let's see what's up
 with that.

00:58.659 --> 01:02.263
Jane Villanueva grew up
 in a house with three women,

01:02.296 --> 01:03.597
one bathroom...

01:06.234 --> 01:07.601
...and no boundaries.

01:07.635 --> 01:09.437
Abuela, mom's in a rush,
remember?

01:09.470 --> 01:10.504
She's got that interview.

01:10.538 --> 01:11.872
Actually, I cancelled.

01:11.905 --> 01:13.674
I just don't want
to be a dance teacher.

01:13.707 --> 01:14.775
(spits, gasps)

01:14.808 --> 01:16.244
Eww!
Oh...

01:16.277 --> 01:17.411
Gross, get it out, get it out!

01:17.445 --> 01:18.579
Oh, Janie.
Oh!

01:18.612 --> 01:20.481
I'm sorry.
Maybe we wouldn't
have to share a bathroom

01:20.514 --> 01:21.649
if you got a regular job.

01:21.682 --> 01:23.751
But there are some lines

01:23.784 --> 01:25.553
that should never be crossed.

01:25.586 --> 01:27.087
I'm so sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.

01:28.156 --> 01:30.591
No, i-it's okay.

01:33.227 --> 01:37.265
It's just not easy to give up
on my dream, that's all.

01:37.298 --> 01:38.866
It never is.

01:38.899 --> 01:43.137
You can't just say you
had a dream, I need details.

01:43.171 --> 01:44.272
I don't remember
anything specific.

01:44.305 --> 01:46.740
(funky music plays)

01:46.774 --> 01:47.741
Yeah, I call bull.

01:47.775 --> 01:48.809
Enough!

01:48.842 --> 01:50.178
I have to draw
the line somewhere,

01:50.211 --> 01:51.579
and telling my mom
the ins and outs

01:51.612 --> 01:52.680
of my sex fantasy
is definitely crossing it.

01:52.713 --> 01:55.316
Did you say
ins and outs?

01:55.349 --> 01:56.784
Seriously?

01:56.817 --> 01:58.752
What, are you 15?
Maybe.

01:58.786 --> 02:00.321
So, you gonna
go for it?

02:00.354 --> 02:01.889
With Professor Chavez?

02:01.922 --> 02:03.891
Mom, h-he's my advisor.

02:03.924 --> 02:04.892
It wouldn't
be appropriate.

02:04.925 --> 02:06.260
Then why'd you
put on lipstick

02:06.294 --> 02:07.361
to go meet with him?

02:07.395 --> 02:08.362
What's that
shade called,

02:08.395 --> 02:09.630
Lusty Virgin?

02:09.663 --> 02:10.631
(Mateo crying)

02:10.663 --> 02:12.233
Coming, Mateo,
and guess what?

02:12.266 --> 02:13.434
Your grandmother's
a bigger baby than you.

02:15.569 --> 02:16.904
(laughs)

02:16.937 --> 02:19.273
(phone chimes)

02:20.441 --> 02:22.376
Oh, shoot.

02:22.410 --> 02:25.813
Hey, so Diego finally
texted me back,

02:25.846 --> 02:27.948
and he can meet the day
after tomorrow at 4:00.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.617
Could Rafael
watch the baby?

02:29.650 --> 02:32.386
Ah, he's got meetings and I...
I'm teaching.

02:32.420 --> 02:34.822
Sorry, I mean if I want
to get on the schedule,

02:34.855 --> 02:36.524
I have to kiss the ring.

02:36.557 --> 02:38.226
Yeah, of course,
I'll text Chepa.

02:38.259 --> 02:39.527
ROGELIO:
I'm here.

02:39.560 --> 02:40.761
Ah.

02:40.794 --> 02:43.631
Mom, he wants to
do this for you.

02:43.664 --> 02:44.798
Come on, it's sweet.

02:44.832 --> 02:47.368
Xiomara, meet your
40 and fabulous

02:47.401 --> 02:49.370
glam squad.

02:49.403 --> 02:50.304
Ah.

02:50.338 --> 02:52.573
My hair stylist, Shalisha.

02:55.008 --> 02:57.345
My costume designer, Marina.

02:59.480 --> 03:01.915
And your photographer,
Alejandra.

03:03.917 --> 03:05.819
Nice to meet you guys.

03:05.853 --> 03:07.721
(Xiomara chuckling)
Yes, yes.

03:07.755 --> 03:09.390
I thought I was getting
my picture taken.

03:09.423 --> 03:11.659
I didn't know this was
gonna be a big production.

03:11.692 --> 03:13.594
Getting one's picture taken
is always a big production.

03:13.627 --> 03:15.329
Besides, we need
wonderful images to put up

03:15.363 --> 03:16.730
at your birthday party.

03:16.764 --> 03:18.266
Which we agreed
to keep small.

03:18.299 --> 03:20.568
Agreed.
A small birthday blowout!

03:20.601 --> 03:22.836
Now, pick a dress.

03:22.870 --> 03:24.738
(laughing):
Wow.

03:24.772 --> 03:25.739
They're a bit...

03:25.773 --> 03:27.441
Breathtaking?
...much.

03:27.475 --> 03:28.709
Ah, do you have anything

03:28.742 --> 03:30.544
shorter, less foufy?

03:30.578 --> 03:34.248
I'll make them short
and non-foufy.

03:35.015 --> 03:36.350
JANE:
Shoot...

03:36.384 --> 03:38.352
Chepa can't babysit.

03:38.386 --> 03:39.887
You need a babysitter?

03:39.920 --> 03:41.255
Say no more,
I will do it.

03:41.289 --> 03:42.556
Eh...

03:42.590 --> 03:44.458
Uh, well, that's
a really nice offer, Dad,

03:44.492 --> 03:46.560
but you've only changed, like,
one diaper in your life.

03:46.594 --> 03:48.696
That's all it took for me
to master the skill.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.698
Yeah, but you don't
have a car seat.

03:50.731 --> 03:51.899
Marina, call production
and have them buy me

03:51.932 --> 03:53.467
the world's finest car seat.
Yeah, but Dad,

03:53.501 --> 03:55.736
Mateo's crawling now,
so he's super fast.

03:55.769 --> 03:58.839
Jane, do you doubt
my babysitting skills?

03:58.872 --> 04:00.641
Because you have asked me
to watch Mateo before.

04:00.674 --> 04:02.343
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Only to be nice,

04:02.376 --> 04:04.345
and only when she knew
 he wasn't available.

04:04.378 --> 04:06.547
That's true.
Then it's settled.

04:06.580 --> 04:08.682
And that's when Mateo
 said his first word.

04:08.716 --> 04:10.284
No.

04:10.318 --> 04:12.620
Well, Jane wished he had,
 but he didn't,

04:12.653 --> 04:14.021
so instead she had to say...

04:14.054 --> 04:15.255
Yes?

04:22.530 --> 04:23.697
A little more, though.

04:23.731 --> 04:25.366
Sorry, I'm trying.

04:25.399 --> 04:26.500
Xiomara, what's wrong?

04:26.534 --> 04:28.369
Is it the lighting?

04:28.402 --> 04:31.639
Because I can assure you your
skin is as luminous as mine.

04:31.672 --> 04:33.741
No, i-it's not that.

04:33.774 --> 04:35.343
Take five, Alejandra.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.912
What's going on?
Talk to me.

04:38.946 --> 04:40.448
(sighs)

04:40.481 --> 04:43.651
It's just all this
40 and fabulous stuff.

04:43.684 --> 04:46.053
I never thought I'd be 40
and teaching the Whip/Nae Nae

04:46.086 --> 04:47.588
to a bunch of seven-year-olds.

04:47.621 --> 04:48.589
Hey, stop.

04:48.622 --> 04:49.590
I promise you're going

04:49.623 --> 04:50.758
to have fun at the party.

04:50.791 --> 04:53.794
I have a wonderful
surprise for you.

04:53.827 --> 04:55.596
WESLEY:
 Surprise, surprise.

04:55.629 --> 04:57.064
More mayhem at the Marbella.

04:57.097 --> 04:58.899
I'm standing in front
of the boutique Miami hotel

04:58.932 --> 05:01.935
run by the rakish Rafael Solano
and his glamorous ex-wife Petra

05:01.969 --> 05:03.671
because this very hotel

05:03.704 --> 05:05.973
is now believed to be associated
with two major players

05:06.006 --> 05:07.708
in the Miami drug trade.

05:07.741 --> 05:09.543
Okay, I get the point.

05:09.577 --> 05:10.844
We're at 40% capacity.

05:10.878 --> 05:11.712
Events are getting cancelled.

05:11.745 --> 05:14.415
Then I'll float us
again this month.

05:14.448 --> 05:16.016
It's a bigger problem than that,
and you know it.

05:16.049 --> 05:17.618
(knocking)
Look, Jane and Mateo are here,

05:17.651 --> 05:18.652
I got to call you back.

05:22.723 --> 05:24.558
RAFAEL:
 What time did he get up

05:24.592 --> 05:26.360
from his nap?
Uh, 1:30.

05:26.394 --> 05:27.561
1:30.

05:27.595 --> 05:29.697
All right,
so I'll put him down at 4:30.

05:29.730 --> 05:31.432
You look really nice.

05:31.465 --> 05:33.901
Oh, thanks.

05:33.934 --> 05:35.035
Okay, bye, Mateo.

05:35.068 --> 05:37.438
(smooching)

05:37.471 --> 05:38.906
Hey, where'd you say
you were going?

05:38.939 --> 05:41.842
Oh, I'm just, uh, going
to meet with my thesis advisor

05:41.875 --> 05:43.577
to go over my reading tonight.

05:43.611 --> 05:45.979
Oh. Hope you get lucky
with your advisor.

05:46.013 --> 05:47.781
I'm sorry, what was that?

05:47.815 --> 05:50.117
I said, good luck
with your advisor.

05:50.150 --> 05:51.385
Thank you.

05:51.419 --> 05:52.486
(whispering):
Bye.

05:52.520 --> 05:53.854
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Which brings us here, now,

05:53.887 --> 05:57.124
to Jane
 and the dreamy professor

05:57.157 --> 05:58.759
Jonathan Chavez.

05:58.792 --> 06:00.661
So, I think you're
in great shape for the reading.

06:00.694 --> 06:04.031
Yeah, I just have a
few last minute notes,

06:04.064 --> 06:05.799
mostly concerning
the male character.

06:05.833 --> 06:07.735
Okay, yeah, sure.

06:07.768 --> 06:10.037
Great, in this
next pass,

06:10.070 --> 06:11.972
I want you to really
drill down on him.

06:12.005 --> 06:13.941
Yeah, yeah, yeah,

06:13.974 --> 06:15.142
I-I will, um,
drill down on him.

06:15.175 --> 06:16.176
You know, what makes him

06:16.209 --> 06:17.911
specific?

06:19.179 --> 06:20.714
(sexy jazz music plays)

06:20.748 --> 06:23.551
You know, what makes him sexy?

06:23.584 --> 06:25.085
*

06:26.920 --> 06:29.457
Why is she willing
to cross the line for him?

06:29.490 --> 06:31.124
Does that make sense?

06:31.158 --> 06:32.626
Yeah, definitely.

06:32.660 --> 06:33.627
I have marked

06:33.661 --> 06:36.163
a few places here.

06:36.196 --> 06:39.032
(upbeat music plays)

06:39.066 --> 06:40.501
Are you hot?

06:40.534 --> 06:41.435
Hmm?

06:42.470 --> 06:43.704
The AC's out.

06:45.839 --> 06:46.907
Anyway, you get

06:46.940 --> 06:47.941
what I'm saying, right?

06:47.975 --> 06:49.910
Get to who this guy is...

06:49.943 --> 06:51.211
underneath.

06:51.244 --> 06:52.713
Got it.

06:52.746 --> 06:55.849
I... I'll really get
underneath him...

06:56.950 --> 06:59.019
...with the writing.

06:59.052 --> 07:00.821
And speaking
 of getting underneath...

07:01.922 --> 07:03.491
This is taking too long.

07:03.524 --> 07:05.092
IT's working as fast
as they can.

07:05.125 --> 07:06.627
You recall a chip was found

07:06.660 --> 07:07.661
embedded in Michael's leg.

07:07.695 --> 07:08.796
We need to bring
in another team.

07:08.829 --> 07:09.797
No.

07:09.830 --> 07:11.499
We keep the circle small.

07:11.532 --> 07:12.933
Rose and Elena can't find out
we have the chip.

07:12.966 --> 07:14.167
It's the only way we can use it
to draw them out.

07:14.201 --> 07:17.104
(phone rings)

07:17.137 --> 07:18.238
Barnett.

07:18.271 --> 07:19.673
LUISA:
What are you wearing?

07:20.708 --> 07:23.944
Well, I'm at the office, so...

07:23.977 --> 07:25.713
So the boxy, gray jacket?

07:25.746 --> 07:27.180
Mm...

07:27.214 --> 07:31.819
Yes, I'm actually
in the middle of something.

07:31.852 --> 07:32.953
Are you working on my case?

07:32.986 --> 07:35.689
I can't confirm that.

07:35.723 --> 07:37.525
Uh, can I get back to you later?

07:37.558 --> 07:39.827
Does that mean that
I'm gonna see you later?

07:39.860 --> 07:41.829
Yes.
 Interesting.

07:41.862 --> 07:44.064
Okay, well, then just text me
when you're on your way over.

07:44.097 --> 07:44.998
Susanna.

07:45.032 --> 07:46.534
IT's got something.

07:46.567 --> 07:47.835
You've made no progress.

07:47.868 --> 07:49.970
No progress on the chip.

07:50.003 --> 07:51.539
I did find something else.

07:51.572 --> 07:54.007
We've been using
facial recognition software

07:54.041 --> 07:56.109
to analyze pictures we found
at Elena's house.

07:56.143 --> 07:58.111
This is her

07:58.145 --> 08:00.948
with her stepdaughter, Clara.

08:00.981 --> 08:04.084
If you measure the distance
between her eyes,

08:04.117 --> 08:06.053
age her up...

08:07.621 --> 08:09.056
...change the hair color...

08:11.191 --> 08:12.526
Oh, my God.

08:12.560 --> 08:13.827
Oh, my God.

08:13.861 --> 08:15.596
Oh, my God.

08:15.629 --> 08:16.630
Sorry, here you go.

08:18.866 --> 08:20.067
It's Rose.

08:20.100 --> 08:22.002
Elena is Rose's
stepmother?

08:22.035 --> 08:23.804
JANE:
 "The revelation was unlikely,

08:23.837 --> 08:25.839
"but so was his presence there.

08:25.873 --> 08:28.876
"The stranger she passed
so many times without stopping,

08:28.909 --> 08:31.144
"he gave his name, Armando.

08:31.178 --> 08:33.647
"'So we're no longer strangers.'

08:33.681 --> 08:35.649
"And then he smiled,
revealing one front tooth

08:35.683 --> 08:37.885
"that was ever so slightly
longer than the other,

08:37.918 --> 08:40.187
"which she fixated on
a little too long.

08:40.220 --> 08:41.955
"But what else could she do?

08:41.989 --> 08:43.123
"She was overwhelmed,

08:43.155 --> 08:44.858
"and more so
when he moved closer

08:44.892 --> 08:47.094
"and asked her point blank,
'What do you want?'

08:47.127 --> 08:48.596
"And he was no longer
a stranger,

08:48.629 --> 08:50.664
"and there was that tooth,

08:50.698 --> 08:53.934
"so what else could she say
but, 'I want you, Jonathan.'"

08:55.636 --> 08:57.170
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Wait, did she just say...

08:57.204 --> 08:59.740
I mean Armando.

09:06.146 --> 09:07.180
He probably
didn't even notice.

09:07.214 --> 09:08.749
How could
he not notice?

09:08.782 --> 09:10.618
You guys noticed, and
it's not even your name.

09:12.085 --> 09:13.787
Stay cool.
Mm-hmm.

09:14.822 --> 09:16.590
Great job.

09:16.624 --> 09:19.326
Yeah, I really think
that last pass helped.

09:19.359 --> 09:20.861
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Okay, maybe he didn't notice.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.863
Thanks, great.

09:22.896 --> 09:26.199
I especially like the addition
of the Jonathan character.

09:26.233 --> 09:28.335
Seems like a great guy.

09:28.368 --> 09:29.770
Mm.

09:29.803 --> 09:31.071
XIOMARA:
 What kind of wink?

09:31.104 --> 09:34.074
You know, he closed
and then opened his eye.

09:34.107 --> 09:35.943
Like in a,
"You're funny, kiddo,"

09:35.976 --> 09:39.680
kind of way or like,
"I heard what you did there,

09:39.713 --> 09:40.948
and we'll follow up
on this later."

09:40.981 --> 09:45.285
I don't know,
like somewhere in between.

09:45.318 --> 09:46.954
Seriously?

09:46.987 --> 09:48.656
A bowl of marbles?

09:48.689 --> 09:49.890
This place is a death trap.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.825
Which is why
we're baby-proofing.

09:51.859 --> 09:55.328
Here, give those to me,
I'll take them to his room.

09:55.362 --> 09:57.931
Oh, so, is Professor
Hottie even single?

09:57.965 --> 09:59.032
No idea.

09:59.967 --> 10:01.268
I think so.

10:01.301 --> 10:04.204
A little online stalking
shows a recent divorce.

10:04.237 --> 10:05.338
So, just go for it.

10:05.372 --> 10:07.340
What do you mean, "Go for it"?

10:07.374 --> 10:09.176
But there's a line, Mom.

10:09.209 --> 10:10.177
Like a clear line.

10:10.210 --> 10:12.145
He's my professor.

10:12.179 --> 10:13.814
And I don't even know
if he's open to it.

10:13.847 --> 10:16.216
That's because you're not
paying attention to the signs.

10:16.249 --> 10:17.685
Oh, my God!

10:17.718 --> 10:18.752
What?

10:18.786 --> 10:19.753
Ma?

10:19.787 --> 10:21.789
(exhaling)

10:23.256 --> 10:26.093
It's nothing, I-I-I, um,
I just overreacted.

10:26.126 --> 10:28.696
I found this.

10:28.729 --> 10:29.963
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 It should be noted that

10:29.997 --> 10:31.231
Jane knew exactly
 what that was.

10:31.264 --> 10:33.801
For Xiomara.
I think you should marry her.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.236
What?

10:36.269 --> 10:37.204
Nothing.

10:37.237 --> 10:39.072
You know something about this.
What is it?

10:39.106 --> 10:40.373
Mom, do you really want to know?

10:40.407 --> 10:41.341
Yes.

10:42.743 --> 10:46.113
I heard Liliana give
the ring to Dad.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.748
Said to propose to you.

10:48.949 --> 10:49.983
Really?

10:50.017 --> 10:51.819
So, I take it that'd be a yes?

10:51.852 --> 10:53.120
Yeah.
Oh...

10:53.153 --> 10:56.990
(crying):
I think we're finally ready.

10:57.024 --> 11:00.060
Oh, this must be the surprise
he was hinting about.

11:00.093 --> 11:03.296
I feel so bad for giving him
such a hard time.

11:03.330 --> 11:04.397
(keys in door)
Oh!

11:04.431 --> 11:06.066
Take it off.
Hurry.

11:06.099 --> 11:07.067
I'm trying.

11:07.100 --> 11:08.301
It's stuck.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.439
Hey, Dad.
You're early.

11:12.472 --> 11:14.808
Yes, my...

11:14.842 --> 11:15.876
my scenes got moved.

11:15.909 --> 11:17.410
What's going on here?

11:17.444 --> 11:18.812
You got us.

11:18.846 --> 11:19.880
We're baby-proofing
the apartment.

11:19.913 --> 11:21.815
You know Jane,
such a worrywart.

11:21.849 --> 11:24.317
Oh, yeah, my first
solo adventure with Matelio.

11:24.351 --> 11:25.786
(laughs)

11:25.819 --> 11:28.088
What, now?

11:28.121 --> 11:29.757
Oh, fist bump. My bad.

11:29.790 --> 11:31.859
(makes explosion sound)

11:33.326 --> 11:34.762
You didn't blow it up.

11:34.795 --> 11:35.796
You always blow it up.

11:35.829 --> 11:37.164
Why do you say that?

11:37.197 --> 11:38.465
Plus, obviously, you have
something in your hand.

11:42.870 --> 11:43.937
We found the ring.

11:48.475 --> 11:50.443
Oh, well.

11:50.477 --> 11:52.345
I was saving it
for a special occasion.

11:52.379 --> 11:53.914
It's the closest thing

11:53.947 --> 11:55.215
I have to a family heirloom.

11:55.248 --> 11:56.784
I want you to have it,

11:56.817 --> 11:58.819
Jane.

12:00.353 --> 12:01.822
Oh.

12:03.056 --> 12:06.226
Oh.
(sighs)

12:06.259 --> 12:08.061
It's beautiful.

12:09.262 --> 12:11.131
Thanks, Dad.

12:11.164 --> 12:13.333
RAFAEL:
 Okay, uh, a little bad news,

12:13.366 --> 12:14.968
but I need you
to stay calm.

12:15.002 --> 12:16.770
In the history of time,

12:16.804 --> 12:18.906
has telling anyone to stay calm
actually helped them stay calm?

12:18.939 --> 12:21.241
I just get word
the Hillcroft-Stanton wedding

12:21.274 --> 12:22.943
is being moved
to a different hotel.

12:22.976 --> 12:24.812
What?

12:24.845 --> 12:26.279
B-because of that Web site?

12:26.313 --> 12:29.917
Rafael, this is a huge wedding,
and it's in two weeks.

12:29.950 --> 12:30.984
If they move,
everyone will know why.

12:31.018 --> 12:32.920
Their friends
will follow.
I know, I know, stay...

12:32.953 --> 12:33.987
Don't say it!

12:34.021 --> 12:35.122
I wasn't.

12:35.155 --> 12:37.424
Stay... paying attention.

12:37.457 --> 12:39.326
Look, please...

12:39.359 --> 12:43.463
I know Izzie Hillcroft
a little from,

12:43.496 --> 12:47.034
you know, back in the day.

12:47.067 --> 12:48.802
She's having
an art opening tomorrow.

12:48.836 --> 12:50.337
I'll go, assure her

12:50.370 --> 12:52.239
the hotel is safe,
that this is all behind us,

12:52.272 --> 12:56.476
and, you know,
charm her a little.

12:56.509 --> 12:59.813
You really think you can charm
a woman about to get married?

12:59.847 --> 13:02.182
It worked with you.

13:02.215 --> 13:03.951
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 True, for the record.

13:03.984 --> 13:05.352
You recall their first meeting,

13:05.385 --> 13:07.287
the night she got engaged.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.122
(applause)

13:12.259 --> 13:15.562
So, listen, I'd love
to take you out.

13:15.595 --> 13:17.097
I'm engaged.

13:17.130 --> 13:19.266
Yeah, for now.

13:22.402 --> 13:23.503
How's Saturday?

13:23.536 --> 13:25.572
(phone buzzing)

13:25.605 --> 13:27.440
I... have to get this.

13:27.474 --> 13:28.842
Saturday.

13:28.876 --> 13:30.277
(laughing):
I can't.

13:30.310 --> 13:34.014
(phone buzzing)

13:34.047 --> 13:35.048
Say yes.

13:37.584 --> 13:39.152
Yes.

13:41.488 --> 13:44.591
(phone buzzing)

13:44.624 --> 13:48.161
Hi, Mother,
everything all right?

13:48.195 --> 13:51.064
Yes, he proposed.

13:51.098 --> 13:53.867
But I think I might just have
caught a much bigger fish.

13:53.901 --> 13:56.569
And speaking of trying
 to catch a big fish...

13:56.603 --> 13:59.940
I think I'm
gonna throw up.

13:59.973 --> 14:01.174
Do-do you need a minute?

14:01.208 --> 14:03.376
I need a lifetime.

14:03.410 --> 14:05.178
Elena was Rose's
stepmother?

14:05.212 --> 14:07.014
I... ah...

14:07.047 --> 14:08.415
what a screwed up
family relationship.

14:12.119 --> 14:15.488
(alarm ringing)

14:15.522 --> 14:18.025
So, what,
Elena married my father

14:18.058 --> 14:20.560
and then when he divorced her,
she sent Rose in to marry him

14:20.593 --> 14:22.162
and use the hotel as a front?

14:22.195 --> 14:23.496
It's pretty much what
we're thinking.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.565
Yeah.
Oh, wow.

14:25.598 --> 14:27.567
It's just so
inappropriate.

14:27.600 --> 14:30.437
(alarm ringing)

14:30.470 --> 14:32.672
I mean, where are
the boundaries, you know?

14:32.705 --> 14:35.375
Oh, God, it's just...
it's so insane.

14:35.408 --> 14:38.245
It's hard to believe,
but then again there's Joey.

14:38.278 --> 14:39.546
(chuckles)

14:40.713 --> 14:42.382
Uh, Joey. Who's-who's Joey?

14:42.415 --> 14:44.584
Luisa, do you know this man?

14:44.617 --> 14:46.186
Yeah.

14:46.219 --> 14:48.521
He drove me and Rose
a few times.

14:50.057 --> 14:52.492
Do you know how to get
in touch with him?

14:52.525 --> 14:54.227
And from one
 secret mission to...

14:54.261 --> 14:56.496
operation suss out
 whether or not Professor Chavez

14:56.529 --> 14:57.664
might be receptive
 to a relationship

14:57.697 --> 14:58.999
between two consenting adults,

14:59.032 --> 15:00.433
one of whom is Jane.

15:00.467 --> 15:02.235
Jane, hey.

15:02.269 --> 15:04.637
Hey, uh, so I just finished
teaching my class,

15:04.671 --> 15:06.073
and I thought I'd
come by and say hi.

15:06.106 --> 15:07.507
I just read
your last chapter.

15:07.540 --> 15:08.641
Do you want
to go over it?

15:08.675 --> 15:10.343
Oh, yeah, I'd love to.

15:10.377 --> 15:11.644
Oh, he's moving over.

15:11.678 --> 15:13.646
Go sit by him
 before he gets up.

15:13.680 --> 15:15.515
It's really coming along.

15:15.548 --> 15:18.385
I mean, I-I'm loving
the forbidden love theme.

15:18.418 --> 15:19.386
Thank you.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.454
Did he just scooch closer?

15:21.488 --> 15:23.523
He did, he did.

15:23.556 --> 15:25.058
That's definitely a good sign.

15:25.092 --> 15:26.659
Yeah, I don't think
you need this part here.

15:26.693 --> 15:29.496
I would just jump right
into the juicy stuff.

15:29.529 --> 15:31.198
Okay, your move, Jane.

15:31.231 --> 15:33.133
Kick this operation
 into high gear.

15:33.166 --> 15:34.734
Move closer.

15:34.767 --> 15:37.470
Actually, this is making me
 feel a little pervy.

15:37.504 --> 15:39.006
Take it away, Jane.

15:39.039 --> 15:40.673
JANE:
 Okay, subtle sign back.

15:40.707 --> 15:42.109
Some light physical contact.

15:42.142 --> 15:43.743
Just show him I'm open,

15:43.776 --> 15:45.512
and we'll see
 if he moves or not.

15:45.545 --> 15:47.480
Okay, almost there.

15:47.514 --> 15:50.683
Almost there.

15:50.717 --> 15:54.021
And I wouldn't-I wouldn't
give this away here.

15:54.054 --> 15:55.755
I would allude
to it, instead.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.724
(whispering):
Okay.
 What if he doesn't feel it?

15:59.192 --> 16:01.361
You know what,
let me get you your own copy

16:01.394 --> 16:03.363
so you can take notes.

16:03.396 --> 16:06.199
So, pretty clear sign.

16:06.233 --> 16:07.300
He's not interested.

16:07.334 --> 16:08.568
Yeah, I wanted
to ask you something.

16:08.601 --> 16:11.438
I-I hope I'm not
crossing a line here.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.640
Go ahead.
 He's going to ask me out.

16:13.673 --> 16:16.043
Yeah, I saw your dad
at the reading,

16:16.076 --> 16:20.380
and my mom is a huge fan
of his telenovelas.

16:20.413 --> 16:22.315
Ooh, that's a blow.

16:22.349 --> 16:24.384
So, I was wondering if...

16:24.417 --> 16:26.053
it's not too inconvenient to,

16:26.086 --> 16:29.322
maybe we could visit
the set some time with you.

16:29.356 --> 16:31.624
Okay, at least
 he wants you there.

16:31.658 --> 16:33.126
Yeah, totally.

16:33.160 --> 16:34.227
That's really easy
for me to organize.

16:34.261 --> 16:35.628
I'd love to.

16:35.662 --> 16:37.230
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Enough. I'm back.

16:37.264 --> 16:38.765
Okay, a date
 with Professor Chavez

16:38.798 --> 16:41.068
and... his mother.

16:41.101 --> 16:42.502
Still, it's a start.

16:42.535 --> 16:44.804
For starters,
just stay on point.

16:44.837 --> 16:46.606
You are not
affiliated in any way

16:46.639 --> 16:47.774
with anything drug-related.

16:47.807 --> 16:49.209
You've had no relationship

16:49.242 --> 16:50.410
with your mother
for over 20 years.

16:50.443 --> 16:52.079
Got it, shh,
there she is.

16:52.112 --> 16:53.413
Izzie.

16:54.447 --> 16:55.748
Hey.

16:55.782 --> 16:57.350
It's good to see you.

16:57.384 --> 16:59.219
You have got to be kidding me.

16:59.252 --> 17:01.288
Okay, look, I'm sorry

17:01.321 --> 17:02.622
to just show up
here like this,

17:02.655 --> 17:04.656
and I get how you
might think poorly of me

17:04.691 --> 17:06.292
given that my family's
been in the news...

17:06.326 --> 17:07.527
Ooh, you?

17:07.560 --> 17:09.195
This isn't about you.
It's about her.

17:10.297 --> 17:13.400
After the news reports,
I realized that Petra

17:13.433 --> 17:15.202
is affiliated
with the Marbella again.

17:16.336 --> 17:19.771
I'm-I'm sorry, have-have we met?

17:19.806 --> 17:22.608
Once, about five years ago.

17:22.642 --> 17:26.079
I was working as a barista
and you flipped out on me

17:26.113 --> 17:27.780
when I accidentally
spilled coffee.

17:27.814 --> 17:29.382
Ooh, and I got fired.

17:30.583 --> 17:32.219
Uh.

17:32.252 --> 17:33.753
I... M-m-maybe
you were just
I, uh...

17:33.786 --> 17:35.688
confusing me
with someone else.
Yeah.

17:35.722 --> 17:37.124
Do you know who I am?

17:38.325 --> 17:40.127
Izzie Hillcroft.

17:40.160 --> 17:42.762
No, that's what you said to me.

17:43.863 --> 17:45.265
On the bright side,

17:45.298 --> 17:47.834
it inspired one
of my best works.

17:47.867 --> 17:50.537
I call it,
"The Trophy Wife."

17:52.839 --> 17:55.442
Available for purchase,
of course,

17:55.475 --> 17:56.743
just like the best of them.

18:03.150 --> 18:04.417
Do you remember that time
she was talking about?

18:04.451 --> 18:09.522
No, but I-I'm sure
Izzie provoked it by-by...

18:09.556 --> 18:10.657
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Not knowing your name.

18:10.690 --> 18:12.692
I can fix this.

18:12.725 --> 18:15.428
I will fix this.

18:20.833 --> 18:22.302
It's not me.

18:22.335 --> 18:23.436
Give him to me.

18:23.470 --> 18:24.604
Okay, I-I-I just want

18:24.637 --> 18:25.838
you to remember
that he's crawling.

18:25.872 --> 18:27.807
Okay, and he's a lot
faster than you'd expect.

18:27.840 --> 18:30.177
So, if you put
him down...
I won't put him down.

18:30.210 --> 18:32.179
No, you can put him down, okay,

18:32.212 --> 18:33.713
just remember that he's fast.
(grunts)

18:33.746 --> 18:36.316
(chuckling)

18:36.349 --> 18:38.151
And also he likes
to grab everything.

18:38.185 --> 18:39.486
That's the reason why we put
the glass marbles away.
(clicking)

18:39.519 --> 18:41.854
Dad, are you
even listening to me?

18:41.888 --> 18:43.590
Jane, I got this, I promise.

18:43.623 --> 18:44.857
Just go.

18:45.925 --> 18:47.827
XIOMARA:
 And you actually left?

18:47.860 --> 18:50.297
JANE:
I swear, I'm in the car driving.

18:50.330 --> 18:53.166
I mean, I did make him
swear not to text, or tweet.

18:53.200 --> 18:54.867
Oh, are you there?
A-almost.

18:54.901 --> 18:55.802
Okay, good luck.

18:55.835 --> 18:57.470
Remember,
you are an amazing performer,

18:57.504 --> 18:59.606
and they would be lucky
to have you,

18:59.639 --> 19:01.608
so don't take no for an answer.

19:01.641 --> 19:02.909
(exhales)

19:02.942 --> 19:04.844
I'm sorry,
the answer is no.

19:04.877 --> 19:07.280
Look, I know
my last couple of shows

19:07.314 --> 19:08.715
haven't been huge sellouts.

19:08.748 --> 19:10.417
That's not the problem.

19:10.450 --> 19:12.785
Look, I get that
family drama happens,

19:12.819 --> 19:14.587
and now you got
a grandkid and all,

19:14.621 --> 19:17.257
but you've just cancelled
too many times.

19:17.290 --> 19:18.458
It just doesn't seem like

19:18.491 --> 19:19.826
singing is
your priority anymore.

19:22.229 --> 19:25.398
(sighs)

19:25.432 --> 19:27.434
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And speaking of priorities...

19:27.467 --> 19:29.869
CAR VOICE:
You have one unread message
from Xiomara.

19:29.902 --> 19:31.271
Read messages.

19:31.304 --> 19:32.472
(chiming)
Jane, it's Mom.

19:32.505 --> 19:33.573
Here's a screenshot
of Dad's tweets.

19:33.606 --> 19:34.874
Are you with him?

19:34.907 --> 19:36.443
See tweets below.

19:36.476 --> 19:37.877
Ten minutes looking
for the perfect shoes

19:37.910 --> 19:39.279
to compliment my eyes.

19:39.312 --> 19:40.380
Shoe emoji.

19:40.413 --> 19:41.581
Huffing happy face emoji.

19:41.614 --> 19:42.582
Rainbow.

19:42.615 --> 19:43.583
Seriously?

19:43.616 --> 19:45.218
On the phone with my agent,

19:45.252 --> 19:46.219
fielding multiple offers.

19:46.253 --> 19:48.321
#WhatWillRoDoNext.

19:48.355 --> 19:50.357
See no evil
monkey emoji.

19:50.390 --> 19:51.358
Exfoliating.

19:51.391 --> 19:52.492
#Loofa

19:52.525 --> 19:54.261
Trying on all my fedoras.

19:54.294 --> 19:56.396
#HideInAHat.

19:56.429 --> 19:57.964
You can understand
 Jane's alarm, right?

19:57.997 --> 19:59.532
Because if Rogelio
 was talking to his agent,

19:59.566 --> 20:02.602
and trying on fedoras,
 and exfoliating,

20:02.635 --> 20:04.437
then who the hell
 was watching Mateo?

20:04.471 --> 20:05.638
Where's Matelio?

20:05.672 --> 20:07.006
There he is.

20:07.039 --> 20:09.676
Oh, thank God.

20:09.709 --> 20:11.010
It's good to have a friend

20:11.043 --> 20:12.879
with the same zest for life
that I have.

20:12.912 --> 20:14.447
You want to know my secret?

20:14.481 --> 20:16.349
I'm going to propose
to your grandma

20:16.383 --> 20:18.751
at her birthday party.

20:18.785 --> 20:19.986
I know.

20:20.019 --> 20:22.489
You want to see the diamond?

20:22.522 --> 20:25.258
(musical humming)

20:27.294 --> 20:30.697
After you and I part,
I'm taking it to get set.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.432
Ah.

20:32.465 --> 20:33.433
I know.

20:33.466 --> 20:35.402
It's not too big, right?

20:35.435 --> 20:36.936
I have a little
cash flow problem,

20:36.969 --> 20:37.970
but it's beautiful, no?

20:38.004 --> 20:40.473
Where is the diamond?

20:40.507 --> 20:42.309
There it is.

20:42.342 --> 20:44.043
Where is the diamond?

20:44.076 --> 20:45.578
There it is.

20:45.612 --> 20:48.348
(phone rings)

20:48.381 --> 20:49.616
Hello, Jane.

20:49.649 --> 20:50.650
JANE:
 What are you doing?

20:50.683 --> 20:51.951
ROGELIO:
What do you mean?

20:51.984 --> 20:53.653
Apparently,
you're picking out shoes,

20:53.686 --> 20:54.654
and exfoliating, and...

20:54.687 --> 20:55.322
No, I'm not.

20:55.355 --> 20:56.789
Dad, I read all your tweets.

20:56.823 --> 20:58.291
My tweets?

20:58.325 --> 20:59.859
Those were pre-arranged
publicity tweets.

20:59.892 --> 21:01.361
I have been unfairly maligned.

21:01.394 --> 21:02.362
Oh.

21:02.395 --> 21:03.663
Now can I go back

21:03.696 --> 21:05.332
to watching my grandson?

21:05.365 --> 21:07.467
Yes, of course. I'm so sorry.

21:07.500 --> 21:09.001
We'll see you soon.

21:09.035 --> 21:10.470
Now, where were we?

21:10.503 --> 21:11.838
We were admiring the diamond...

21:14.641 --> 21:16.343
Where is the diamond, Matelio?

21:17.644 --> 21:18.845
Matelio, where is it?

21:18.878 --> 21:20.347
Where is it, Matelio?

21:20.380 --> 21:21.614
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 No, seriously,

21:21.648 --> 21:22.815
where is the diamond?

21:22.849 --> 21:24.884
(musical humming)

21:24.917 --> 21:26.486
(gasps)

21:26.519 --> 21:28.020
Uh-oh.

21:28.054 --> 21:30.357
Okay, that sounds good.

21:30.390 --> 21:32.359
JANE:
Hey, hi.
Yes.

21:32.392 --> 21:33.960
Hi. Can I pick him up?
Yeah, of course.

21:33.993 --> 21:35.362
Hi, baby.

21:35.395 --> 21:36.363
(smooches)

21:36.396 --> 21:37.597
I, uh, I don't understand.

21:37.630 --> 21:38.631
He swallowed something?

21:38.665 --> 21:39.766
A penny, a marble?

21:39.799 --> 21:41.468
I understand
it was a diamond.

21:41.501 --> 21:42.902
(quietly):
What?

21:44.671 --> 21:46.573
Look, he's fine,
and he'll pass it.

21:46.606 --> 21:49.342
But, you're lucky,
this could have been much worse.

21:49.376 --> 21:51.043
So lucky.
I know.

21:51.077 --> 21:53.446
If he develops fever,
or a cough, bring him back.

21:53.480 --> 21:55.648
Otherwise...
just keep an eye out

21:55.682 --> 21:56.716
for a diamond in his poop.

21:56.749 --> 21:59.352
Thank you, Doctor.

22:01.153 --> 22:03.390
I'm sorry, Jane.

22:03.423 --> 22:05.925
You see, I was planning
to propose to Xiomara,

22:05.958 --> 22:08.327
so I was showing Matelio
the diamond.

22:09.696 --> 22:10.997
You're mad.
Dad.

22:11.030 --> 22:13.800
You are.
Who shows a
diamond to a baby?

22:13.833 --> 22:15.101
I was playing with him,

22:15.134 --> 22:16.469
but then you called
about the tweets...

22:16.503 --> 22:17.970
Oh, so, it's my fault?

22:18.004 --> 22:20.607
I'm-I'm just saying...
I... you... distracted me.

22:20.640 --> 22:21.874
I called because
I knew that

22:21.908 --> 22:23.676
you weren't ready
to take care of him,

22:23.710 --> 22:25.612
and clearly I was right
because look at where we are.

22:25.645 --> 22:27.480
You know what, I'm not even mad
at you, I'm mad at myself

22:27.514 --> 22:29.716
because I knew I shouldn't have
left you alone with the baby.

22:39.058 --> 22:40.159
It was just so scary,

22:40.192 --> 22:42.161
thinking about what
could've happened.
No kidding.

22:42.194 --> 22:44.964
Who doesn't feel it when a baby
pulls a button off your shirt?

22:44.997 --> 22:47.700
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Button, diamond,
 same difference.

22:47.734 --> 22:50.903
It was an accident,
and I was really hard on him.

22:50.937 --> 22:52.439
And I'd cancel the set visit,

22:52.472 --> 22:54.040
if I didn't think it'd make
him feel worse.

22:54.073 --> 22:56.108
Ah, yes, the set visit
 with Professor Chavez...

22:56.142 --> 22:57.810
and his mom.

22:57.844 --> 22:59.646
But you're not taking the baby
on your date, right?

22:59.679 --> 23:02.949
No, I'm gonna drop him off at
Raf's, and it's not a date.

23:02.982 --> 23:05.051
It could become one.

23:05.084 --> 23:07.119
Just pay attention to the signs.

23:07.153 --> 23:08.154
What signs?

23:09.689 --> 23:11.991
Look, it's been a while
since I've been single,

23:12.024 --> 23:13.993
and Professor Chavez
is my advisor,

23:14.026 --> 23:15.094
you know, I have to make sure.

23:16.629 --> 23:17.997
So, what am I looking for?

23:18.030 --> 23:21.100
Well, okay, first off,

23:21.133 --> 23:23.570
he'll tell you to stop calling
him Professor Chavez.

23:23.603 --> 23:25.004
Mm-hmm.

23:25.037 --> 23:26.939
Then he'll start being more
familiar, you know?

23:26.973 --> 23:30.176
He'll talk about
non-school events.

23:30.209 --> 23:31.444
He'll touch you.

23:31.478 --> 23:33.045
He'll lean in.

23:33.079 --> 23:34.847
Okay, got it.

23:34.881 --> 23:36.949
Yeah, so, like, if he does
any of those things,

23:36.983 --> 23:38.885
I just...
Respond.

23:38.918 --> 23:40.820
Uh-huh.
Show him you're open.

23:40.853 --> 23:42.021
He's your teacher.

23:42.054 --> 23:43.055
He needs to know
you're cool with it,

23:43.089 --> 23:44.824
otherwise it gets creepy.

23:46.859 --> 23:48.761
And speaking of creepy...

23:48.795 --> 23:50.530
(bell rings)
Jane.

23:57.236 --> 23:58.971
Have there been
any developments?

24:00.673 --> 24:02.609
No, none,
but we're on the lookout.

24:03.643 --> 24:04.977
Look, I don't know if you got

24:05.011 --> 24:06.546
my voice mail last night,

24:06.579 --> 24:09.015
but I am so sorry
about what I said.

24:09.048 --> 24:10.550
Why?

24:10.583 --> 24:11.584
It was what you believed.

24:11.618 --> 24:13.586
Dad, come on...

24:13.620 --> 24:14.987
Oh, your guests
are here.

24:15.021 --> 24:16.923
The show must go on.

24:18.024 --> 24:19.492
(whispering):
Hi.

24:19.526 --> 24:20.493
Uh, Dad,

24:20.527 --> 24:21.828
this is Professor Chavez.

24:21.861 --> 24:23.730
Professor Chavez,
this is my dad Rogelio.

24:23.763 --> 24:24.964
Jonathan, please.

24:24.997 --> 24:29.035
Right, Jonathan.

24:29.068 --> 24:30.737
Rogelio, nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

24:30.770 --> 24:32.171
This is my mom, Diana.

24:32.204 --> 24:34.774
Lovely to meet you.

24:37.810 --> 24:38.878
(sighs)

24:38.911 --> 24:41.581
Wow.

24:41.614 --> 24:42.582
(giggles)

24:42.615 --> 24:43.583
Oh, don't worry,

24:43.616 --> 24:44.617
this happens all the time.

24:44.651 --> 24:45.618
No need to talk.

24:45.652 --> 24:46.919
Just grab my arm

24:46.953 --> 24:47.920
and I will give you
a tour of the set.

24:47.954 --> 24:50.289
(sighing)

24:50.322 --> 24:51.891
(laughs)

24:51.924 --> 24:53.926
I'm freaking out
a little.

24:53.960 --> 24:56.128
I've never seen
my mom like that.

24:56.162 --> 24:58.197
Oh, this happens,
trust me.

24:58.230 --> 25:00.132
No, but you don't understand.

25:00.166 --> 25:03.202
My mom is, like, hard core.

25:03.235 --> 25:05.838
Growing up,
I saw her laugh twice.

25:08.675 --> 25:09.776
Oh, my God,

25:09.809 --> 25:12.545
I think my mom is gonna

25:12.579 --> 25:14.881
try to kiss your dad.

25:17.950 --> 25:22.655
Huh, looks like things
 are looking up for Jane...

25:22.689 --> 25:25.091
Unfortunately,
 not for poor Petra.

25:25.124 --> 25:26.092
Izzie.

25:26.125 --> 25:27.994
Hi.

25:28.027 --> 25:30.262
Did you get the Miami News
 Gazette art critic to my show?

25:30.296 --> 25:32.064
Yes, I did.

25:32.098 --> 25:33.132
I wanted to mend fences.

25:33.165 --> 25:35.234
She is so influential.

25:35.267 --> 25:38.170
Exactly, and my art
was not ready for her.

25:38.204 --> 25:39.706
The review is terrible.

25:39.739 --> 25:41.340
Which I'm sure
is what you wanted.

25:41.373 --> 25:42.809
What? No.

25:42.842 --> 25:45.111
No, no, no,
I was trying to help.

25:45.144 --> 25:46.579
I-I just wished you would've
consulted with me first.

25:46.613 --> 25:47.880
Well, I didn't.
I could have made calls.

25:47.914 --> 25:49.215
I wanted to take care
of this myself.

25:49.248 --> 25:50.850
Why?
Because I am not

25:50.883 --> 25:53.219
some useless trophy wife, okay?

25:54.954 --> 25:56.756
Just for the record,
I never thought that you were.

25:56.789 --> 25:59.926
Okay, let's not get sentimental,
all right?

25:59.959 --> 26:01.894
You stole me away
from your business rival.

26:01.928 --> 26:03.696
Sure sounds like
 a trophy to me.

26:03.730 --> 26:06.232
Yeah, that might have been why
I was interested in you,

26:06.265 --> 26:07.734
but that's not what I loved
about you.

26:09.101 --> 26:10.703
I loved that you were
the kind of person

26:10.737 --> 26:13.606
that saved $743 on fish filets.

26:17.677 --> 26:19.378
PETRA:
And I just, I couldn't
shake the feeling

26:19.411 --> 26:21.714
that the caterer
was gouging us,

26:21.748 --> 26:22.982
so I went to the
fish market
No, you didn't.

26:23.015 --> 26:24.717
and I priced it myself.
Yes, I did.

26:24.751 --> 26:25.985
You went to
the fish market?
I was right.

26:26.018 --> 26:27.186
We were paying $12
per tilapia.

26:27.219 --> 26:28.855
They're seven dollars a cut.

26:28.888 --> 26:31.223
That's $743 right there.

26:31.257 --> 26:35.194
So, you saved $743
on a $100,000 wedding?

26:35.227 --> 26:38.865
No, on a $99,257 wedding.

26:38.898 --> 26:39.866
Oh, you did.
Yes, I did.

26:39.899 --> 26:42.301
(giggling)

26:45.304 --> 26:46.939
That might be
the answer.

26:46.973 --> 26:48.875
Free fish.

26:48.908 --> 26:50.677
Do you know who I am?

26:50.710 --> 26:52.011
Sorry, ma'am, no.

26:52.044 --> 26:53.279
Luisa Alver.

26:53.312 --> 26:55.748
You drove me around
a few times last year.

26:58.785 --> 27:00.052
With Rose Solano.

27:03.289 --> 27:05.825
Look, no one knows I'm here,

27:05.858 --> 27:06.893
but I'm desperate.

27:06.926 --> 27:08.795
I need to get in touch with her.

27:09.829 --> 27:12.098
Please.

27:12.131 --> 27:13.199
I love her,

27:13.232 --> 27:15.067
and I know I shouldn't.

27:15.101 --> 27:18.237
I've tried to stop,
but I just...

27:18.270 --> 27:20.439
I can't let go because

27:20.472 --> 27:22.909
there's a part of me that thinks
that she's coming back for me,

27:22.942 --> 27:24.811
that we're gonna be together.

27:24.844 --> 27:26.813
Okay, look,
you don't have to say anything.

27:26.846 --> 27:28.047
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 No way he was going to.

27:28.080 --> 27:30.049
Just...

27:30.082 --> 27:32.084
give Rose a message for me.

27:33.352 --> 27:35.087
Tell her that if
she wants me to wait,

27:35.121 --> 27:36.388
she should send me donuts.

27:37.890 --> 27:39.692
She'll know the kind.

27:39.726 --> 27:41.060
JONATHAN:
A second donut?

27:41.093 --> 27:42.962
(chuckles)

27:42.995 --> 27:44.463
This is getting
embarrassing.

27:44.496 --> 27:46.332
It's human nature, people
can't turn down free food.

27:46.365 --> 27:50.236
She put seven granola bars
in her purse, I saw her.
(giggling)

27:51.237 --> 27:52.071
You lose something?

27:52.104 --> 27:54.140
I think I left my
cell phone in the car.

27:54.173 --> 27:56.075
Mm.
Can't do that
with a baby at home.

27:56.108 --> 27:56.976
I'll walk you.

27:57.977 --> 27:59.378
I could use some air.

27:59.411 --> 28:01.147
Hey, that looks like

28:01.180 --> 28:02.481
some self-initiated
 body contact right there.

28:02.514 --> 28:05.351
Seriously, Jane,
thanks for doing this.

28:05.384 --> 28:06.953
I mean, I...

28:06.986 --> 28:10.990
I haven't seen my mom
this happy in...

28:11.023 --> 28:12.391
it's been along time.

28:12.424 --> 28:13.960
Oh, my pleasure.

28:13.993 --> 28:15.461
Oh, it means a lot.

28:15.494 --> 28:17.029
And I had fun, too.

28:17.063 --> 28:18.497
Me, too.

28:18.530 --> 28:21.433
Oh, my God, the lean in.

28:21.467 --> 28:22.401
(record scratches)

28:22.434 --> 28:24.771
(smooching)

28:24.804 --> 28:26.773
Or... maybe he was just going

28:26.806 --> 28:28.841
to get the car door.

28:35.414 --> 28:36.916
You misread the signs.
We've all done it.

28:36.949 --> 28:38.918
Really? You've made out
with a guy's sweater

28:38.951 --> 28:42.221
as he desperately
dodged your kiss?

28:42.254 --> 28:44.456
Oh, I just keep replaying it
in my mind.

28:44.490 --> 28:46.092
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 For your viewing pleasure.

28:46.125 --> 28:49.328
(smooching)

28:49.361 --> 28:51.798
Stop it.
I can't.

28:51.831 --> 28:52.832
So, how did you leave things?

28:52.865 --> 28:55.134
Yeah, cut the wheel
a little more to the left...

28:55.167 --> 28:57.403
(both shout)
Sorry. I... it's just...
it's a new car,

28:57.436 --> 28:59.238
CAR VOICE:
Back up.
so I don't really
know the parameters yet.

28:59.271 --> 29:00.372
Straighten it out now.

29:00.406 --> 29:02.241
A little more,
a little more, great.

29:02.274 --> 29:03.910
Okay, now let's get out of here.

29:03.943 --> 29:05.477
You kissed his freaking sweater.

29:07.179 --> 29:08.881
So, what are you gonna do?

29:08.915 --> 29:11.417
I just got to talk to
him about it, you know?

29:11.450 --> 29:12.451
I'm just... I'm gonna

29:12.484 --> 29:14.520
deal with it head on.

29:14.553 --> 29:18.324
Or just transfer
to a different school.

29:18.357 --> 29:20.292
So, I just wanted to say
that I'm really sorry.

29:20.326 --> 29:22.428
Oh good,
 she went with option one.

29:22.461 --> 29:23.295
I only kissed you because

29:23.329 --> 29:24.530
I thought I was getting
signs from you.

29:24.563 --> 29:26.165
From me?
Well, because...

29:26.198 --> 29:28.000
I really wasn't trying to...

29:28.034 --> 29:29.035
No, that is not what I'm saying.

29:29.068 --> 29:30.069
Because I could get in trouble.

29:30.102 --> 29:32.171
Well, that's not what I mean.

29:32.204 --> 29:36.042
I had a crush,
and I guess I projected on you.

29:36.075 --> 29:37.076
But now that it's clear

29:37.109 --> 29:38.410
that it's all in my head,

29:38.444 --> 29:40.346
I was hoping that
we can just move forward

29:40.379 --> 29:42.214
and pretend like
it never happened.

29:42.248 --> 29:44.483
I don't know if that's possible.

29:44.516 --> 29:47.219
It is for me, really.

29:47.253 --> 29:48.420
Please?

29:48.454 --> 29:49.989
Can't we just put this
behind us?

29:51.090 --> 29:53.192
We'll give it a try.

29:56.095 --> 29:57.463
(laughs)

29:57.496 --> 29:58.597
That's your solution?

29:58.630 --> 30:00.099
Yes.

30:00.132 --> 30:01.100
A free wedding.

30:01.133 --> 30:02.068
What's the catch?

30:02.101 --> 30:03.569
Look, The Marbella
can't afford

30:03.602 --> 30:05.071
the bad press
if you cancel.

30:05.104 --> 30:06.605
Plus, your friends
will stay,

30:06.638 --> 30:08.474
they'll have a great time,
and they'll come back,

30:08.507 --> 30:11.510
which is good for us
in the long run.

30:12.644 --> 30:14.813
I have one condition.

30:18.250 --> 30:20.086
You sure
you're okay with this?

30:20.119 --> 30:22.254
Yeah. Whatever,
it's fine.

30:25.524 --> 30:26.959
It's not me.

30:26.993 --> 30:28.060
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And it wasn't.

30:28.094 --> 30:29.095
Not anymore.

30:29.128 --> 30:30.196
Which brings us here,

30:30.229 --> 30:32.598
now, to Jane,

30:32.631 --> 30:34.934
who is back to writing
 after meeting with Jonathan.

30:34.967 --> 30:36.869
Actually, let's go back

30:36.903 --> 30:38.104
to calling him
 Professor Chavez.

31:04.663 --> 31:08.634
Yeah, sometimes when you cross
 a line, you can't go back.

31:08.667 --> 31:10.036
JANE:
 I screwed everything up.

31:10.069 --> 31:11.470
I mean, now I'm
censoring my writing

31:11.503 --> 31:13.205
because I don't want him
to take it the wrong way.

31:13.239 --> 31:15.674
(shower running)
I'm sorry, hon.

31:15.707 --> 31:17.409
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

31:17.443 --> 31:18.945
Okay, no more complaining.

31:18.978 --> 31:20.312
We're gonna have fun
at your party tonight.

31:20.346 --> 31:21.513
(groans)

31:22.481 --> 31:23.515
(Alba screams)

31:26.518 --> 31:27.553
Maybe we wouldn't
have to share a bathroom

31:27.586 --> 31:29.121
if you actually went

31:29.155 --> 31:30.656
to these interviews
and got a regular job.

31:30.689 --> 31:31.690
ALBA:
 Xiomara!

31:31.723 --> 31:33.993
Sorry, Ma, sorry.

31:34.026 --> 31:36.262
(phone rings)

31:36.295 --> 31:38.564
Hello?

31:38.597 --> 31:41.100
Oh, hi.

31:47.073 --> 31:48.574
Why aren't you home
getting ready?

31:48.607 --> 31:51.010
So, I have some bad news,

31:51.043 --> 31:52.444
and I feel terrible.

31:52.478 --> 31:53.445
What's going on?

31:53.479 --> 31:54.513
I have to work tonight,

31:54.546 --> 31:56.182
singing.
What?

31:56.215 --> 31:58.384
Diego offered me a slot,
last minute.

31:58.417 --> 32:00.086
But it's your party.

32:00.119 --> 32:02.521
There are 40 doves waiting
for you to free them.

32:02.554 --> 32:05.257
I know, but...
I have to show him

32:05.291 --> 32:06.725
that singing is my priority.

32:06.758 --> 32:08.327
Xiomara, any other night.

32:08.360 --> 32:09.996
But he's offering tonight.

32:10.029 --> 32:11.530
But I need you at the party.

32:11.563 --> 32:13.265
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Because he's going to propose.

32:13.299 --> 32:14.566
I can't believe
you're doing this.

32:14.600 --> 32:15.701
I can't believe you are.

32:15.734 --> 32:18.004
It's my career, Rogelio,

32:18.037 --> 32:21.173
and that is more important than
a party that I didn't even want.

32:31.650 --> 32:36.155
* Volaré como un ave azul

32:36.188 --> 32:40.492
* Y al llegar, te diré

32:40.526 --> 32:46.065
* Quiero estar, siempre feliz

32:46.098 --> 32:49.768
* Junto a tí

32:49.801 --> 32:56.375
* Brillará, la estrella fugaz

32:56.408 --> 33:02.048
* Que a tus pies, caerá

33:02.081 --> 33:04.250
* Como yo

33:04.283 --> 33:08.154
* Que quiero estar

33:08.187 --> 33:11.423
* Junto a tí

33:11.457 --> 33:13.092
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 You'll recall,

33:13.125 --> 33:15.161
Luisa was waiting
 for a message from Rose.

33:15.194 --> 33:17.229
* Desde el cielo
ángeles dorados *

33:17.263 --> 33:19.065
(knocking on door)

33:19.098 --> 33:22.434
* Anunciaron el momento
en el que naciste tú *

33:22.468 --> 33:24.036
Hey.

33:24.070 --> 33:26.705
Come in.

33:26.738 --> 33:28.440
* Crearon el encanto
de tu luz *

33:28.474 --> 33:31.043
No message from Rose?

33:31.077 --> 33:32.278
Mm-mm.

33:33.545 --> 33:35.347
Who cares?

33:38.217 --> 33:39.751
I don't need her in my life.

33:41.620 --> 33:42.721
Luisa...

33:42.754 --> 33:45.657
Mm-hmm?

33:46.625 --> 33:48.660
* Deseando

33:48.694 --> 33:50.329
* Amanecer

33:50.362 --> 33:51.497
I can't.

33:51.530 --> 33:52.631
(sighs)

33:54.133 --> 33:58.470
Look, I know you
were helping us,

33:58.504 --> 34:00.472
when you were talking
about how you felt...

34:00.506 --> 34:01.807
about Rose?

34:01.840 --> 34:04.042
But that sounded real.

34:05.244 --> 34:07.779
It's 'cause I never got closure.

34:07.813 --> 34:09.114
I know.

34:10.349 --> 34:13.219
But for us...

34:13.252 --> 34:14.553
now is not the time.

34:14.585 --> 34:18.157
* En el que naciste tú

34:18.190 --> 34:21.327
* Y en un sueño hecho realidad

34:21.360 --> 34:23.661
* Crearon el encanto

34:23.695 --> 34:25.397
So, the new
stationery came in.

34:25.431 --> 34:27.766
* De tu luz

34:27.799 --> 34:29.201
I love it.

34:32.904 --> 34:34.806
Very funny.

34:34.840 --> 34:37.176
I'm just really glad
it all worked out.

34:40.478 --> 34:42.748
Me, too.

34:42.781 --> 34:46.418
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Wow, their legs
 are definitely touching.

34:46.452 --> 34:50.688
* Junto a tí

34:50.722 --> 34:56.562
* Es así que por la ciudad

34:56.594 --> 34:59.665
* El amor seguirá

34:59.698 --> 35:01.700
Would you keep still?

35:01.733 --> 35:03.435
I almost poked my eye out.

35:03.469 --> 35:06.905
Sorry, just nerves,
I guess.

35:06.938 --> 35:09.275
You should be nervous.

35:09.308 --> 35:12.278
You fell in love with him.

35:12.311 --> 35:14.446
I told you not
to cross that line.

35:14.480 --> 35:16.815
* Deseando siempre vivir

35:16.848 --> 35:19.851
* Junto a tí

35:19.885 --> 35:21.420
We can't.

35:21.453 --> 35:23.255
Why not?

35:23.289 --> 35:25.824
Seriously, why not?

35:28.427 --> 35:29.728
Are you over Jane?

35:29.761 --> 35:36.168
* Junto a tí.

35:36.202 --> 35:37.803
I'm really glad you came.

35:37.836 --> 35:39.305
Of course I came.

35:39.338 --> 35:41.173
I overreacted
with your mom.

35:41.207 --> 35:42.808
Only because, well,

35:42.841 --> 35:44.543
I wanted to propose
tonight, you know?

35:44.576 --> 35:46.478
Yeah, I know.

35:46.512 --> 35:48.880
And look, Dad,
I overreacted, too,

35:48.914 --> 35:50.949
and I'm so sorry
I yelled at you.

35:50.982 --> 35:52.551
That's not why I was upset.

35:52.584 --> 35:53.485
Mm.

35:53.519 --> 35:56.555
It's just...

35:56.588 --> 35:58.957
w-what if it's true?

35:58.990 --> 36:01.327
What if I'm not good with kids?

36:01.360 --> 36:02.961
I mean, I want them
with your mother.

36:02.994 --> 36:03.862
Dad...

36:03.895 --> 36:05.497
What if I'm terrible at it?

36:05.531 --> 36:09.701
I mean, you turned out
perfect without me.

36:09.735 --> 36:11.737
(laughs softly)

36:11.770 --> 36:13.805
Trust me, I wish I had you.

36:13.839 --> 36:16.375
And you'll be
great, you know?

36:16.408 --> 36:17.909
You'll learn as you go.

36:17.943 --> 36:20.379
You can't just jump in
and expect to know everything.

36:21.447 --> 36:22.414
I promise.

36:22.448 --> 36:23.849
You'll get there.

36:25.384 --> 36:27.486
Oh, and I have
something for you.

36:27.519 --> 36:30.856
It showed up this afternoon.

36:30.889 --> 36:32.591
(sighs)

36:32.624 --> 36:35.727
It's been washed
and disinfected a dozen times,

36:35.761 --> 36:38.297
which is why it's so shiny.

36:39.331 --> 36:40.799
Yeah.

36:40.832 --> 36:42.534
(knock on door)

36:52.278 --> 36:53.912
You were wonderful.

36:53.945 --> 36:55.547
I'm so glad you came.

36:55.581 --> 36:56.982
Ooh, and guess what?

36:57.015 --> 36:59.017
Diego's giving me Monday nights.

36:59.050 --> 36:59.918
I'm back in.

36:59.951 --> 37:01.920
I'm so glad.

37:01.953 --> 37:04.390
And I'm sorry we fought.

37:04.423 --> 37:07.693
It was only because... well...

37:07.726 --> 37:11.363
well, I had planned something.

37:18.704 --> 37:22.408
My buddy, Ryan Gosling, said,
"The only quality I look for

37:22.441 --> 37:25.010
"in a woman is that
she's Eva Mendes.

37:25.043 --> 37:27.679
There's nothing else
I'm looking for."

37:27.713 --> 37:29.648
At this point I was
going to wave to Eva,

37:29.681 --> 37:32.918
and then look at you,
and tell you...

37:32.951 --> 37:35.887
that you are what
I've been looking for.

37:35.921 --> 37:37.489
(laughs softly)

37:37.523 --> 37:39.958
And I think back
to when we first met,

37:39.991 --> 37:43.362
when we were 16,
and I think that

37:43.395 --> 37:45.964
my whole journey up to now

37:45.997 --> 37:48.800
has been about finding my way
back to you.

37:52.103 --> 37:54.773
I haven't had time
to have it set.

37:54.806 --> 37:56.308
(cries)

37:56.342 --> 37:59.311
It's a long story.

37:59.345 --> 38:02.548
Xiomara Gloriana Villanueva,

38:02.581 --> 38:05.984
I want to spend
my life with you,

38:06.017 --> 38:07.819
and raise kids with you...

38:07.853 --> 38:09.988
so...

38:10.021 --> 38:11.990
will you marry me?

38:12.023 --> 38:14.993
I...

38:15.026 --> 38:16.928
want to.

38:16.962 --> 38:18.630
Okay.

38:20.432 --> 38:21.533
So?

38:21.567 --> 38:22.634
But...

38:24.636 --> 38:26.405
...there is one thing...

38:26.438 --> 38:29.641
that I didn't know,
but I'm realizing.

38:31.643 --> 38:34.045
I don't want to have
any more kids.

38:34.079 --> 38:36.415
What?

38:36.448 --> 38:41.453
Because I-I-I want the
next 20 years to be about me.

38:43.054 --> 38:45.824
Is that a deal-breaker?

38:48.660 --> 38:50.562
(shimmering music fades)

38:52.798 --> 38:54.032
I don't know.

38:54.065 --> 38:55.634
JANE:
 And then what did he say?

38:55.667 --> 38:59.705
That he had
to think about it.

38:59.738 --> 39:01.540
Wow.

39:01.573 --> 39:04.510
I know.

39:04.543 --> 39:09.481
And look, maybe it is
a midlife crisis, but...

39:09.515 --> 39:12.551
I just started
thinking about my life,

39:12.584 --> 39:15.587
and-and what I want it to look
like going forward, you know?

39:15.621 --> 39:17.389
Yeah.

39:17.423 --> 39:18.824
Yeah, I get that.

39:18.857 --> 39:21.627
What's going on with you?

39:21.660 --> 39:24.463
No, ah, nothing, I'm fine.

39:24.496 --> 39:25.731
Jane.

39:25.764 --> 39:27.499
I need to get my mind
off the ring.

39:28.534 --> 39:31.770
I can't believe

39:31.803 --> 39:34.172
I just jeopardized
my writing career

39:34.205 --> 39:36.875
over a hot guy
I had some sex dreams about.

39:36.908 --> 39:38.810
I ju-I just...

39:38.844 --> 39:41.713
oh, I feel so...

39:41.747 --> 39:42.714
I don't know...

39:42.748 --> 39:43.715
Horny.

39:43.749 --> 39:44.950
I was going to say

39:44.983 --> 39:47.453
at a crossroads.

39:47.486 --> 39:50.656
But, yeah, maybe that, too.

39:50.689 --> 39:55.193
I don't know, Mom, this whole
no-sex-till-marriage thing is...

39:55.226 --> 39:56.462
I mean...

39:56.495 --> 39:57.596
I could see the finish line.

39:57.629 --> 39:58.597
First with Michael.

39:58.630 --> 40:01.199
And then Rafael, and...

40:01.232 --> 40:07.038
now, it's not even in sight,
and I'm a mom.

40:07.072 --> 40:09.908
When I was ten years old,
making that promise,

40:09.941 --> 40:11.910
I didn't see this coming.

40:11.943 --> 40:14.012
Yeah, makes sense.

40:14.045 --> 40:15.947
(sighs)

40:15.981 --> 40:19.651
So, maybe it's time
to reevaluate?

40:22.053 --> 40:24.623
Yeah, maybe.

40:30.496 --> 40:32.798
(sighs)

40:39.538 --> 40:40.872
JANE:
 Hey.

40:43.041 --> 40:45.210
I just wanted to say,

40:45.243 --> 40:46.878
you were right.

40:46.912 --> 40:49.581
I crossed a line
and now there's no turning back,

40:49.615 --> 40:53.151
and I'm mad at myself, but...

40:53.184 --> 40:55.120
I should get another advisor.

40:55.153 --> 40:56.888
Are you sure
that's what you want?

40:56.922 --> 41:00.626
No, but it's what I have to do,

41:00.659 --> 41:04.062
because what happened is getting
in the way of my writing.

41:04.095 --> 41:06.665
If you think
that's for the best.

41:07.833 --> 41:09.768
I do.

41:09.801 --> 41:12.203
So, I'll see you around.

41:12.237 --> 41:13.672
Wait.

41:19.578 --> 41:22.180
Since you're no
longer my advisee,

41:22.213 --> 41:27.052
I was wondering if you wanted
to get dinner sometime.

41:28.086 --> 41:30.188
Yes.

41:30.221 --> 41:32.057
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Well, isn't that
 a nice surprise.

41:32.090 --> 41:33.224
Also a surprise?

41:33.258 --> 41:34.560
Did you find
something on the chip?

41:34.593 --> 41:35.961
Finally...

41:35.994 --> 41:37.696
yes.

41:37.729 --> 41:39.164
Our first face.

41:46.872 --> 41:48.874
I wasn't sure if you'd come.

41:48.907 --> 41:50.942
And speaking
 of a hidden face...

41:50.976 --> 41:53.745
Of course, I came.

41:53.779 --> 41:57.983
If the police have the chip,
we both have a problem...

41:58.016 --> 42:00.552
Mom.
