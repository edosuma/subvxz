NARRATOR: In 1972, a crack commando unit
was sent to prison by a miIitary court...

00:59.313 --> 01:00.891

l don't know who you are...

07:03.469 --> 07:06.387
Your father was a dreamer,
with a very colorful past.

07:06.472 --> 07:08.797
He was a lifer with the Bushnell Cavaliers.

07:08.891 --> 07:11.014
AMY: When he retired,
he went to South Africa...

07:11.102 --> 07:14.019
where he spent all of his time
prospecting diamond mines.

07:14.188 --> 07:15.730

Let's just say if we didn't,
you wouldn't have gotten this far.

He had a dream.
All his life, he wanted his own mine.

07:32.164 --> 07:35.165
lt wasn't even the money.
lt was the romance of it.

He owns a piece
of every mine in South Africa.

07:43.176 --> 07:46.959
He wasn't about to let my father
have one little mine he could call his own.

lose everything my father worked for.

08:05.239 --> 08:06.568

08:06.657 --> 08:08.983
Wouldn't that
blow the diamonds everywhere?

08:09.076 --> 08:12.113
lt's not for the diamonds.
We have other equipment for that.

08:12.205 --> 08:15.953
lt's to blow out an airshaft
so we can work the lower levels of the mine.

08:16.042 --> 08:19.624
TOBY: But like l said,
l need somebody to get it up that road.

But you're not paying us to be stupid.
Now, did you get the truck and supplies?

So what? l'm a supply store. But--

14:55.107 --> 14:59.105
To continue, said dynamite was defective...

14:59.195 --> 15:01.234
and a premature explosion...

15:01.322 --> 15:05.189
caused the untidy demise
of 22 workers employed...

15:05.284 --> 15:09.152
to renovate the bridge at Breaker Pass.
How do you respond to that?

15:09.247 --> 15:10.955
By saying that's bloody impossible...

'cause there ain't no bridge
over Breaker Pass, that's why.

or shipping dates on any of these.

on the black market, are you?

l bought this stuff all legal,
and you can bank that at Barclays.

All right, nail down exactly where they are
and zero me in.

35:16.787 --> 35:19.076
Will do. We're opening up on them now.

35:32.053 --> 35:35.303

Toby, can you get us there?

35:35.389 --> 35:37.678
All right. Face, stick with her.
You got the point?

35:37.767 --> 35:41.930

B.A., l'll bring up the rear.

FACE: Ready.

35:47.068 --> 35:48.562
Murdock, go!

-What are we going to do now?
-The thing is, what are they gonna do?

36:44.041 --> 36:46.746
Probably blow the mine.
We end up under a pile of rocks...

36:46.836 --> 36:48.295

HANNlBAL: ls there another exit out of here?
TOBY: No.

36:50.798 --> 36:53.467
We sure could use that air shaft
you wanted, right now.

36:53.634 --> 36:56.837
Fletcher wouldn't blow this mine.
He wants to work it.

36:57.096 --> 37:00.180
That's why he hired Alan Scheckter
to kill my father.

37:00.266 --> 37:04.050

Scheckter, you take Landers
and get some tear gas.
