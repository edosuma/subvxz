WEBVTT

00:25.949 --> 00:27.919
Are we really fuckin' doin' this?

00:27.920 --> 00:28.753
Yeah.

00:28.754 --> 00:30.919
We're fuckin' doin' this.

00:30.920 --> 00:32.423
We don't have a choice.

00:33.530 --> 00:35.109
There's always a choice.

00:35.110 --> 00:37.239
There's always a way we can go.

00:37.240 --> 00:38.543
We can just fuckin' run.

00:39.690 --> 00:41.993
This time, we don't have a way out.

00:42.930 --> 00:46.379
This is the moment we knew was coming.

00:46.380 --> 00:47.780
The moment we been dreading.

00:48.970 --> 00:50.106
Our backs are against the wall,

00:50.107 --> 00:51.863
but we're fuckin' doin' this.

00:53.220 --> 00:54.509
No.

00:54.510 --> 00:55.819
No, this,

00:55.820 --> 00:57.959
we don't know this fuckin' guy.

00:57.960 --> 00:59.379
I don't know this house.

00:59.380 --> 01:01.323
I don't even know what
fuckin' street I'm on.

01:02.390 --> 01:03.549
I haven't eaten shit all day.

01:03.550 --> 01:06.504
You know I get all fuckin'
weird with that low blood sugar.

01:08.070 --> 01:09.563
This fuckin' feels off.

01:10.940 --> 01:13.853
Just relax, fuckin' relax.

01:16.196 --> 01:17.323
Oh, fuck this.

01:18.300 --> 01:20.539
We're just goin' in for a second.

01:20.540 --> 01:22.890
This guy isn't anything
we have to worry about.

01:26.265 --> 01:29.385
By the way, we're on Nash Street, come on.

01:29.386 --> 01:30.669
We're goin' in.

01:30.670 --> 01:31.540
We're buyin' a quarter.

01:31.541 --> 01:33.639
Once we know he's sellin', that's it.

01:33.640 --> 01:34.640
We'll be on our way.

01:37.080 --> 01:38.219
All right.

01:38.220 --> 01:39.053
You're right.

01:40.436 --> 01:41.679
You're doin', you're doin'
all the fuckin' talkin'.

01:41.680 --> 01:45.395
Hey, don't get all shy
guy on me, all right?

01:45.396 --> 01:46.579
These dealers are paranoid.

01:46.580 --> 01:50.003
If they think we're narcs,
they'll turn us away,

01:51.117 --> 01:51.950
or...

01:53.070 --> 01:53.993
they'll shoot us.

01:57.610 --> 01:59.410
Hey, don't worry about it right now.

02:00.750 --> 02:01.583
Let's go.

02:04.518 --> 02:06.459
And I'm sorry I didn't take
you to eat before this.

02:06.460 --> 02:08.009
I shoulda been thinkin' of you.

02:36.250 --> 02:37.083
What's up, buds?

02:37.084 --> 02:40.323
I'm Cliff, this is my friend, Otis.

02:42.910 --> 02:44.363
What you doin' on my porch?

02:45.330 --> 02:48.223
Pete Simms told us he was gonna call ya.

02:50.680 --> 02:51.993
Said we were comin' over.

02:53.410 --> 02:54.460
Could you hook us up?

02:55.520 --> 02:58.294
Oh, fuck, 'course.

02:58.295 --> 03:00.089
Why didn't you say so, bud?

03:00.090 --> 03:01.269
Yeah, he totally called.

03:01.270 --> 03:02.190
I'll, uh...

03:03.670 --> 03:04.503
Let ya in.

03:09.286 --> 03:10.953
Welcome to the casa.

03:12.640 --> 03:14.119
Nice house.

03:14.120 --> 03:15.339
Oh, for sure.

03:15.340 --> 03:17.909
It's kind of an old man river of a place.

03:17.910 --> 03:20.059
AC doesn't work, little bit of a

03:20.060 --> 03:22.379
unknown stink comin' from the sink area,

03:22.380 --> 03:24.829
but you know, it's nice, right?

03:24.830 --> 03:27.423
I mean, what's the word?

03:29.690 --> 03:31.249
Quaint?

03:31.250 --> 03:33.409
No, not quaint, that's all right.

03:33.410 --> 03:34.853
I was thinkin' like, cozy.

03:35.930 --> 03:38.710
Cozy or...

03:39.720 --> 03:41.023
How 'bout rustic?

03:43.170 --> 03:44.779
No, not rustic.

03:44.780 --> 03:46.259
Rustic?

03:46.260 --> 03:48.772
Jesus, Otis.

03:48.773 --> 03:50.763
It's not a fucking cabin in the woods.

03:51.610 --> 03:53.979
There's a strip club two
or three minutes from here.

03:53.980 --> 03:57.103
That pedophile man we
passed right outside?

03:58.000 --> 04:00.113
How the fuck could that be rustic?

04:02.630 --> 04:03.463
I know.

04:04.443 --> 04:06.979
It's not a house, it's a pad.

04:06.980 --> 04:07.813
Fuck.

04:07.814 --> 04:08.949
Perfect.

04:08.950 --> 04:10.619
It's a great pad you got here.

04:10.620 --> 04:12.999
What'd you say your name was again?

04:13.000 --> 04:14.109
Name's Christopher.

04:14.110 --> 04:16.219
Chris, nice to meet you.

04:16.220 --> 04:17.620
Nice to meet you, as well.

04:21.200 --> 04:23.453
I help you boys to some brews, here?

04:26.130 --> 04:27.940
We're in a bit of a hurry.

04:29.300 --> 04:31.449
Love one, thanks.

04:31.450 --> 04:32.283
There we go.

04:32.284 --> 04:35.443
I know we got some Moorlies, little IPA.

04:36.400 --> 04:39.059
Oh, dude, we got a shitty home brew,

04:39.060 --> 04:40.869
but it's a home brew.

04:40.870 --> 04:42.463
You drink a fuckin' home brew.

04:43.671 --> 04:44.504
So.

04:46.490 --> 04:47.490
All right.

04:51.520 --> 04:53.669
You guys were sent from Pete Simms.

04:53.670 --> 04:56.163
I speculate you're here for the chronic.

04:57.200 --> 04:59.759
Friend of Pete's is a friend of mine.

04:59.760 --> 05:00.593
So.

05:03.080 --> 05:04.880
I'm gonna hook you up with a sample.

05:05.880 --> 05:06.713
Now,

05:07.850 --> 05:10.993
I know how mind blowing this shit is, so,

05:12.490 --> 05:15.593
I'm gonna need to see your
faces after the first puff.

05:16.599 --> 05:17.859
I don't know.

05:17.860 --> 05:19.160
We're in a bit of a hurry.

05:22.030 --> 05:24.599
We're not in that big of a hurry.

05:24.600 --> 05:25.463
There it is.

05:26.940 --> 05:27.773
Whoo!

05:29.290 --> 05:31.813
Lemme tell ya, you won't regret.

05:40.750 --> 05:41.583
Thanks.

05:46.600 --> 05:50.363
Yeah, it's, it's so nice.

05:57.440 --> 06:00.489
That's some seriously sweet chronic.

06:00.490 --> 06:03.513
Oh, for sure best
stuff I've smoked, hands down.

06:05.500 --> 06:06.500
So, what do you say?

06:10.043 --> 06:11.459
Could we get,

06:11.460 --> 06:12.823
could we get a quarter?

06:14.130 --> 06:15.769
Absolutely.

06:15.770 --> 06:18.149
Allow me to show you to the stash.

06:18.150 --> 06:19.657
It's downstairs.

06:22.020 --> 06:23.199
Wait.

06:23.200 --> 06:24.869
Can't we just do the deal up here?

06:24.870 --> 06:26.470
Why do we have to go downstairs?

06:27.350 --> 06:28.750
That's where the stash is.

06:30.100 --> 06:35.106
Listen, you boys help yourself
to whatever's in the fridge.

06:35.130 --> 06:36.919
Make yourself at home.

06:36.920 --> 06:38.718
I'm gonna go take a tinkle.

06:38.719 --> 06:40.103
I'll be right back, okay?

06:43.738 --> 06:44.821
What the...

06:46.298 --> 06:48.133
I don't fuckin' like this.

06:50.250 --> 06:52.100
You said we were gonna be in and out.

06:53.330 --> 06:54.580
We know he's got the pot.

06:55.440 --> 06:57.349
Why are we goin' downstairs?

06:57.350 --> 06:58.813
Dude, relax.

06:59.980 --> 07:01.699
We have to do this deal.

07:01.700 --> 07:04.829
One joint doesn't say shit.

07:04.830 --> 07:06.263
We've gotta do this deal.

07:07.130 --> 07:09.323
We've got to see that he's got the stash.

07:10.870 --> 07:12.683
You know we've gotta go down there.

07:13.770 --> 07:16.283
So, quit bein' a pussy, and come on.

07:17.550 --> 07:19.453
No, we don't.

07:20.400 --> 07:21.763
I'm stoned out of my head.

07:23.300 --> 07:25.649
We don't have to go down there.

07:25.650 --> 07:27.683
The guy just fuckin' sniffed my face.

07:29.070 --> 07:32.029
Shut the fuck up, Otis.

07:32.030 --> 07:33.373
Pull yourself together.

07:34.240 --> 07:35.543
We've gotta go down there.

07:36.520 --> 07:39.090
Quit talkin' about all
this bolting bullshit

07:40.650 --> 07:41.483
and follow me.

07:43.168 --> 07:44.335
Fuck.

07:46.220 --> 07:48.633
Hey, oh right this way.

08:04.210 --> 08:05.043
Hey guys.

08:08.600 --> 08:11.979
This strapping young man is Cliff.

08:11.980 --> 08:14.749
Cliff, Jocelyn, Klaus.

08:14.750 --> 08:16.419
Klaus is German.

08:16.420 --> 08:17.999
He's a little bit spotty with the English,

08:18.000 --> 08:20.829
but don't let that stop
you from talking to him.

08:20.830 --> 08:23.589
He's fucking hilarious.

08:23.590 --> 08:27.479
And this handsome devil is Otis.

08:27.480 --> 08:28.769
I think, right, Otis?

08:28.770 --> 08:30.639
Yeah? Yeah.

08:30.640 --> 08:35.208
Anyway, Otis is not much
of a talker but what he

08:35.210 --> 08:39.719
lacks in wordplay, he makes
up with wicked enthusiasm

08:39.720 --> 08:41.239
and I'm tellin' ya, a penchant

08:41.240 --> 08:43.369
for bein' a lady killer, this guy.

08:43.370 --> 08:46.239
Probably a shitty poker
player, though, am I right?

08:46.240 --> 08:47.198
Thanks, bud.

08:47.199 --> 08:48.448
'Preciate that.

08:50.518 --> 08:54.357
Anyhoo, Otis, Klaus, Jocelyn.

08:58.416 --> 08:59.249
Otis.

09:00.640 --> 09:01.473
Hi Jocelyn.

09:05.750 --> 09:06.763
Have a seat, bud.

09:08.096 --> 09:09.146
Finish up this joint.

09:18.490 --> 09:19.490
You guys like bongs?

09:35.136 --> 09:36.136
Do you mind?

09:47.816 --> 09:50.373
Hey, does Klaus not smoke?

09:52.120 --> 09:53.379
Oh, he smokes.

09:53.380 --> 09:55.430
He's all fucked up on 'shrooms right now.

09:59.520 --> 10:02.083
Wait, Klaus doesn't smoke?

10:04.086 --> 10:05.855
Oh, he smokes.

10:05.856 --> 10:08.525
But he's all fucked up
on 'shrooms right now.

10:08.526 --> 10:11.526
Hey, does Klaus not smoke?

10:16.936 --> 10:18.106
Oh, he smokes.

10:18.107 --> 10:20.917
But he's all fucked up
on 'shrooms right now.

10:23.140 --> 10:26.033
Wait, Klaus doesn't smoke?

10:29.320 --> 10:30.946
Oh, he smokes,

10:30.947 --> 10:32.975
but he's all fucked up
on 'shrooms right now.

10:39.170 --> 10:40.969
Oh, he smokes, all right,

10:40.970 --> 10:43.993
but he's all fucked up
on a broom right now.

10:49.970 --> 10:52.026
Oh, he might be a witch, the way he's

10:52.027 --> 10:54.455
ridin' a broom right now.

10:58.400 --> 11:00.397
Oh, he smokes, all right,

11:00.398 --> 11:02.595
but he's got 'shrooms pulsing

11:02.596 --> 11:05.265
in his fucking face right now.

11:22.045 --> 11:25.339
Do you ever get that feeling

11:25.340 --> 11:27.390
when you first meet someone, that

11:28.960 --> 11:30.423
maybe you've met them before?

11:32.260 --> 11:34.213
Maybe we knew each other in a past life.

11:35.930 --> 11:37.623
Maybe it was in a dream.

11:44.120 --> 11:45.539
It doesn't

11:45.540 --> 11:47.239
happen very often,

11:47.240 --> 11:48.073
and

11:48.930 --> 11:50.423
never in this way.

11:52.670 --> 11:54.859
Sometimes it's just a feeling like it was

11:54.860 --> 11:57.823
a friend or maybe Deja Vu.

11:59.220 --> 12:00.053
But with you,

12:01.699 --> 12:03.449
it is very different.

12:05.100 --> 12:06.110
I feel

12:07.377 --> 12:08.210
an energy with you.

12:11.464 --> 12:12.297
Almost

12:13.337 --> 12:14.587
an electricity.

12:15.900 --> 12:17.320
Do you feel that?

12:18.677 --> 12:20.094
Yep, I feel it.

12:21.529 --> 12:22.362
I, uh...

12:23.970 --> 12:24.803
Gotta be honest.

12:24.804 --> 12:26.733
I'm a little nervous.

12:28.347 --> 12:31.756
It's not because you're beautiful,

12:31.757 --> 12:34.273
or it's probably because you're beautiful,

12:35.889 --> 12:39.099
but I'm pretty stoned right now.

12:39.100 --> 12:39.933
Relax.

12:41.097 --> 12:42.489
Enjoy

12:42.490 --> 12:44.138
the ride.

12:44.139 --> 12:47.333
The night is only going to get weirder.

12:52.380 --> 12:54.598
All right, you're up, bud.

13:06.150 --> 13:07.533
Holy shit!

13:09.050 --> 13:10.273
It burns!

13:11.350 --> 13:12.464
Sure does, bud.

13:12.465 --> 13:14.003
That's how you know it's working.

13:21.520 --> 13:23.389
Just keep on drinkin' that beer, bud.

13:23.390 --> 13:24.640
We're gonna be all right.

13:40.823 --> 13:42.219
Oh my God.

13:42.220 --> 13:46.709
I was thinking about when
you first meet someone.

13:46.710 --> 13:48.063
Like us, tonight,

13:49.500 --> 13:50.333
and you know,

13:51.770 --> 13:53.170
most of the people you meet,

13:54.070 --> 13:56.170
I don't even remember their fuckin' names,

13:57.600 --> 14:02.123
and after a few days,
I forget their faces.

14:04.760 --> 14:06.460
It's almost like I never met them.

14:08.793 --> 14:09.993
But, that's life, right?

14:11.970 --> 14:13.023
People come and go.

14:15.943 --> 14:17.793
Forgetting's just a coping mechanism.

14:22.180 --> 14:23.380
But then like, with you,

14:25.480 --> 14:26.313
tonight,

14:28.020 --> 14:32.030
I feel like every so
often you meet someone

14:33.052 --> 14:34.602
that you were destined to meet.

14:35.990 --> 14:36.823
Like,

14:38.553 --> 14:42.020
Fate.

14:42.021 --> 14:42.854
Yeah.

14:44.321 --> 14:45.891
Fate.

14:45.892 --> 14:48.420
You think we were meant to be.

14:48.421 --> 14:49.254
I do.

14:51.320 --> 14:55.769
Sounds crazy, but, I
feel like our spirits,

14:55.770 --> 14:58.399
they've been searching for each other

14:58.400 --> 15:00.170
for who knows how long

and tonight, here,

15:07.200 --> 15:08.700

15:19.380 --> 15:20.213
Please.

15:20.214 --> 15:22.203
Yah, be right back.

15:27.630 --> 15:28.880

18:33.910 --> 18:34.743
These hippies?

18:36.380 --> 18:38.086
They ain't shit.

18:38.087 --> 18:41.779
That girl, that chick, she

18:41.780 --> 18:43.079
All right, you know something' Fowlkes?

18:43.080 --> 18:45.949
Fuck you, you're a hater and an idiot.

18:45.950 --> 18:47.029
You hate.

18:47.030 --> 18:48.139
Yeah, yeah.

18:48.140 --> 18:49.379
Right, Swish.

18:49.380 --> 18:50.699
You know something?

18:50.700 --> 18:53.259
You're a fuckin' idiot too yourself.

18:53.260 --> 18:54.979
You don't know anything about music.

18:54.980 --> 18:56.859
I know music.

18:56.860 --> 18:58.219
I don't know if it's because
you have a little dick

18:58.220 --> 18:59.949
or maybe it's because your mother was

18:59.950 --> 19:01.909
drunk was she was pregnant
with you, I don't know.

19:01.910 --> 19:02.743
Sure.

19:02.743 --> 19:03.576
Yeah.

19:03.576 --> 19:04.530
I know about music.

19:04.531 --> 19:07.229
Why don't you just shut the fuck up

19:07.230 --> 19:10.599
and think about the next Craigslist hooker

19:10.600 --> 19:12.539
that you're gonna fall in love with.

19:12.540 --> 19:14.349
Okay, you know what?

19:14.350 --> 19:17.139
First, Daisy was a nice girl, okay?

19:17.140 --> 19:19.589
And second, just because
you sing in the church choir

19:19.590 --> 19:22.109
in between your binge drinking
and your Asian porn addiction

19:22.110 --> 19:24.269
doesn't mean you know
anything about music.

19:24.270 --> 19:26.609
I know fucking music, all right?

19:26.610 --> 19:28.109
I seen Hootie and The Blowfish

19:28.110 --> 19:30.399
in concert twice, for Chrissake.

19:30.400 --> 19:31.913
Yeah, yeah right.

19:34.730 --> 19:35.763
Hey, relax Frye.

19:36.830 --> 19:38.529
We're not gonna miss much,

19:38.530 --> 19:41.180
just maybe a couple of bong
rips or something, but...

19:42.040 --> 19:44.275
When they seal the deal, we got 'em.

19:44.276 --> 19:46.499
Hey, do we know if our
backup's gonna be ready?

19:46.500 --> 19:49.379
This is gonna happen soon, I can feel it.

19:49.380 --> 19:50.809
Our backup better be fucking ready.

19:50.810 --> 19:51.740
They're ready.

19:51.741 --> 19:53.639
They're parked around the corner.

19:53.640 --> 19:55.323
They're just waitin' for our call.

20:08.001 --> 20:09.633
You see that?

20:09.634 --> 20:10.702
What the fuck?

20:10.703 --> 20:12.379
Just keep walkin'.

20:12.380 --> 20:15.749
If they say anything, we're fuckin' gone.

20:15.750 --> 20:17.179
Go, Swish, go.

20:17.180 --> 20:18.013
Police!

20:18.014 --> 20:19.059

20:19.060 --> 20:20.103

20:51.920 --> 20:56.920
Okay, everybody, I'd like to

20:57.550 --> 21:01.569
Mikey, he's a Virgo, fisherman kinda.

21:01.570 --> 21:03.856
Never catches a damn thing, do ya, Mike?

21:03.857 --> 21:05.913
Mehmet is Armenian.

21:07.070 --> 21:08.139
Fuckin' Turkish, bro.

21:08.140 --> 21:09.100
I'm Turkish, everyone.

21:09.101 --> 21:10.449
Fuckin' Turkish.

21:10.450 --> 21:11.290
'Course, well anyway.

21:11.291 --> 21:13.089
You know Klaus and Jocelyn.

21:13.090 --> 21:16.219
Here we have the new buds, Otis and Cliff.

21:16.220 --> 21:17.649
Good people.

21:17.650 --> 21:18.483

21:18.484 --> 21:20.400
We been having a fuckin' hoot of a time.

21:21.710 --> 21:23.809
Pop a squat, bro.

21:23.810 --> 21:24.993
Finish that story.

21:25.950 --> 21:29.419
Man, so there we are,
you know, at the bar.

21:29.420 --> 21:33.119
Ordered a couple drinks,
chillin', you know Chris?

21:33.120 --> 21:34.096
Sure do, bud.

21:34.097 --> 21:36.229
Just a couple drunk assholes at the bar.

21:36.230 --> 21:41.109
Yes, exactly, but up
walks this Russian bitch.

21:41.110 --> 21:43.359
Sexiest thing you've
ever seen in your life.

21:43.360 --> 21:47.159
Fat ass and without
thinking, I had to say,

21:47.160 --> 21:48.630
I said goddamn!

21:49.503 --> 21:50.481
Goddamn.

21:50.481 --> 21:51.314
Mmm hmm.

21:51.315 --> 21:53.029
Actually, she was Bulgarian.

21:53.030 --> 21:54.629
Even better.

21:54.630 --> 21:55.920
Well man, can we just agree

21:55.921 --> 21:58.689
this bitch had an amazing ass?

21:58.690 --> 21:59.523
Oh yeah.

21:59.523 --> 22:00.356
One in a million.

22:02.220 --> 22:06.519
Thank you, and you know
Chris, when it comes to asses,

22:06.520 --> 22:10.453
I do not play because I am an ass man.

22:12.630 --> 22:13.463
You know,

22:15.250 --> 22:16.989
when I was in elementary school,

22:16.990 --> 22:19.909
all the other kids were
on the slide, the swings,

22:19.910 --> 22:23.319
shit, on the fuckin'
teeter totter, but not me.

22:23.320 --> 22:24.499
Wanna know why?

22:24.500 --> 22:26.356
Why is that, bud?

22:26.357 --> 22:28.839
'Cause I do not play.

22:28.840 --> 22:32.721
When it comes to asses, I don't play.

22:34.920 --> 22:35.753
All right.

22:35.754 --> 22:37.279
We get it, you don't play.

22:37.280 --> 22:39.563
Oh this girl,
she was not amused.

22:41.960 --> 22:43.733
No, I mean, Jocelyn.

22:44.620 --> 22:46.799
If a guy's sittin' at
the bar and you walk by

22:46.800 --> 22:49.859
and he says goddamn, you gonna take that

22:49.860 --> 22:51.023
as a compliment, right?

22:59.550 --> 23:01.159
Exactly.

23:01.160 --> 23:03.760
Ass girl doesn't
like the ass compliments.

23:05.850 --> 23:06.979
She slapped him.

23:06.980 --> 23:07.813
She did.

23:07.814 --> 23:11.449
So, we got up and politely walked away,

23:11.450 --> 23:13.259
finished our drinks.

23:13.260 --> 23:14.093
No big deal.

23:16.370 --> 23:18.169
You curse out a
little Philly with a nice

23:18.170 --> 23:22.609
turd cutter and proceed to get wasted,

23:22.610 --> 23:24.329
am I close?

23:24.330 --> 23:25.536
Very close.

23:25.537 --> 23:28.729
And there I am, you know, relaxing,

23:28.730 --> 23:32.029
trying to drink my
cocktail in peace when...

23:32.030 --> 23:33.549
The boyfriend.

23:33.550 --> 23:35.269
Yeah, can you believe that?

23:35.270 --> 23:38.659
I try and pay a girl a very
classy compliment like that

23:38.660 --> 23:41.919
so up walks the biggest
Russian dude I've ever seen.

23:41.920 --> 23:44.249
Coulda been a tranny, but my knowledge

23:44.250 --> 23:46.929
of Russian trannies is a
story for another night.

23:46.930 --> 23:47.880
Big fucker.

23:47.881 --> 23:51.679
Not Russian but friends
behind him all stand up.

23:51.680 --> 23:53.729
I'm sure Mikey
shit his pants right away.

23:53.730 --> 23:55.256
Fuck, and I did.

23:55.257 --> 23:56.679
I shit my pants right there.

23:56.680 --> 23:57.759
But you know what?

23:57.760 --> 23:59.869
Now, now I'm ready to fight.

23:59.870 --> 24:02.029
I know the end is near, I just know it.

24:02.030 --> 24:03.999
I did the only thing I
could think of at that point

24:04.000 --> 24:06.719
to save my Persian friend.

24:06.720 --> 24:09.109
Turkish, bro, I'm fuckin' Turkish bro.

24:09.110 --> 24:10.859
So, Mike grabs this big Russian guy

24:10.860 --> 24:13.469
by the fuckin' balls and
he grabbed 'em hard...

24:13.470 --> 24:15.619
Well, I got his whole set, you know,

24:15.620 --> 24:16.869
fuckin' locked in this iron grip,

24:16.870 --> 24:19.589
leadin' this cocksucker around the room.

24:19.590 --> 24:22.229
He doesn't know what
to do and his friends,

24:22.230 --> 24:25.049
shit, just sittin' over in
the corner, got nothin'.

24:25.050 --> 24:26.010
Might as well be in Russia.

24:26.011 --> 24:27.609
Might as well be in fuckin' Russia.

24:27.610 --> 24:28.443
Yeah.

24:28.444 --> 24:30.869
Somehow, Mike lets go and we dart.

24:30.870 --> 24:32.289
The three friends run after us,

24:32.290 --> 24:33.690
but what they didn't know...

24:34.738 --> 24:36.439
Know what?

24:36.440 --> 24:39.619
They didn't know that they were fuckin'

24:39.620 --> 24:41.723
with the scrotum samurai.

24:44.010 --> 24:44.843
Nice.

24:46.420 --> 24:48.409
This guy's an idiot,

24:48.410 --> 24:51.203
and his stories are super lame.

24:52.909 --> 24:55.399
Do you wanna do something weird with me?

24:55.400 --> 24:56.589
Yes.

24:56.590 --> 24:58.229
Yes, I so.

24:58.230 --> 24:59.729
Tell me your life story.

24:59.730 --> 25:00.979
The quick version.

25:00.980 --> 25:04.039
I'm stoned and don't wanna
remember your grandma's name,

25:04.040 --> 25:05.875
tonight, at least.

25:14.500 --> 25:15.850
Good afternoon, everyone.

25:17.840 --> 25:19.107
Good afternoon, Maija.

25:23.990 --> 25:24.978
I'm sorry, son.

25:24.979 --> 25:26.239
I don't think we've met.

25:26.240 --> 25:27.609
Who are you?

25:27.610 --> 25:29.067
I'm Otis.

25:29.068 --> 25:29.901
Okay.

25:29.902 --> 25:31.789
Oh, this is Maija's caretaker.

25:31.790 --> 25:34.929
She's been so positive since
they started working together.

25:34.930 --> 25:36.659
He's like family to us.

25:36.660 --> 25:39.063
That's great, that's really great.

25:40.300 --> 25:42.713
She'll need Otis now more than ever.

25:43.830 --> 25:45.239
We've had some setbacks.

25:45.240 --> 25:47.713
Maija's health is
declining at a rapid rate.

25:49.220 --> 25:51.595
It cannot be reversed or slowed.

25:52.578 --> 25:53.411
Hey, hey, hey.

25:53.412 --> 25:55.830
I suggest you take
some time off from work,

25:57.310 --> 26:00.249
spend as much time with
her as you can right now

26:00.250 --> 26:02.340
because there won't be much.

26:04.244 --> 26:07.729
Hey, I'll take care of you.

26:07.730 --> 26:10.530
I'll see you in a
week and we can reevaluate.

26:20.240 --> 26:21.073
Wow.

26:22.690 --> 26:25.203
You were going somewhere deep.

26:26.510 --> 26:28.833
Hey, relax.

26:30.640 --> 26:32.969
I thought it'd be a fun game.

26:32.970 --> 26:34.503
Why don't we play it later?

26:36.860 --> 26:39.293
I'm really surprised
though, in a good way.

26:40.150 --> 26:45.150
Every time I play this
game, I mean every time,

26:45.280 --> 26:47.109
the person either starts bragging about

26:47.110 --> 26:49.369
their accomplishments
or material possessions

26:49.370 --> 26:51.609
or starts spouting off
some nervous rhetoric

26:51.610 --> 26:54.583
to try and gather pieces
of their boring lives,

26:56.889 --> 26:57.722
but not you.

27:01.316 --> 27:02.777
I guess I'm different.

27:05.230 --> 27:06.280
Maybe a little weird.

27:07.609 --> 27:08.859
I like weird.

27:11.380 --> 27:12.380
I like weird, too.

27:13.610 --> 27:14.443
I'm weird.

27:16.110 --> 27:16.943
I like it.

27:22.250 --> 27:23.083
Fuck.

27:24.227 --> 27:25.549
Goddammit.

27:25.550 --> 27:27.173
What the fuck, Swish?

27:28.110 --> 27:29.243
Fuck, God.

27:30.160 --> 27:31.689
Did we just miss that deal?

27:31.690 --> 27:33.429
Did we just miss that fucking deal?

27:33.430 --> 27:35.159
Are you finished?

27:35.160 --> 27:35.993
You done?

27:35.994 --> 27:37.639
Okay, there's no way those two stoners

27:37.640 --> 27:38.929
are walking away without a bag.

27:38.930 --> 27:40.149
No fucking way.

27:40.150 --> 27:42.603
We didn't get it
because we didn't want it.

27:43.920 --> 27:45.239
We want the big deal.

27:45.240 --> 27:46.529
We want the big score.

27:46.530 --> 27:48.439
We don't want this dime bag deal.

27:48.440 --> 27:49.769
Would you just relax?

27:49.770 --> 27:50.760
Fuck!

27:50.761 --> 27:52.260
I wanted that Turkish bastard.

27:53.130 --> 27:54.226
Sorry all.

27:54.227 --> 27:56.229
Fuckin' business.

27:56.230 --> 27:59.733
But, now, we get back to the night.

28:09.596 --> 28:11.429
I think they're ready.

28:13.380 --> 28:15.963
Which one of you yay
hoos plays the guitar?

28:17.140 --> 28:19.039
That's my boy Otis right here.

28:19.040 --> 28:19.873
Oh.

28:22.200 --> 28:23.513
They've spoken.

28:26.570 --> 28:27.573

32:14.000 --> 32:16.209
Lead the fuckin' way.

32:16.210 --> 32:17.043
Yeah.

32:19.500 --> 32:20.959
Good song, bud.

32:20.960 --> 32:21.910
Hey, thanks, man.

32:32.180 --> 32:36.017
So, can I hear your life story now?

32:37.863 --> 32:38.696
Mmm,

32:39.584 --> 32:40.417
no.

32:41.770 --> 32:42.956
Why not?

32:42.957 --> 32:44.643
Aren't we playin' your game?

32:46.140 --> 32:46.973
Uh...

32:49.570 --> 32:50.403
Not...

32:51.590 --> 32:52.593
Not quite yet.

32:56.350 --> 32:57.903
I wanna know something first.

33:00.100 --> 33:01.683
Sure, what?

33:45.314 --> 33:47.142
You're right, bud.

33:47.143 --> 33:48.343
This is a sweet spot.

33:50.010 --> 33:51.403
It is, it is.

33:53.150 --> 33:55.599
The world can be a rough place man,

33:55.600 --> 33:58.793
but this spot right here, right now,

33:59.930 --> 34:01.180
it's good for you and me.

34:02.143 --> 34:02.976
Yeah.

34:06.383 --> 34:08.429
I don't know, man.

34:08.429 --> 34:09.313
I like the world.

34:10.770 --> 34:12.050
I like the people.

34:13.754 --> 34:14.587
The journeys.

34:16.260 --> 34:17.853
Shit, Sammy, I like it all.

34:19.130 --> 34:20.299
Yeah.

34:20.300 --> 34:21.699
Enjoy it, man.

34:21.699 --> 34:22.533
Enjoy it.

34:24.234 --> 34:26.759
'Cause I'm tellin' ya,
there's gonna be a day

34:26.760 --> 34:28.263
when someone that you love,

34:29.290 --> 34:31.683
someone that you just
hold dear to your heart,

34:32.730 --> 34:35.143
they're just gonna fuckin'
rip it all up, man,

34:36.130 --> 34:40.353
and I'm tellin' ya, they're
going to fuck it up,

34:41.320 --> 34:44.723
and in that time, you need
to get back to the wild.

34:45.699 --> 34:48.612
Back to the fucking wilderness,

34:50.120 --> 34:51.969
'cause your heart can scar, man,

34:51.969 --> 34:56.429
but get out here, it can really heal you.

35:31.781 --> 35:32.614
Mmm.

35:36.110 --> 35:37.929
We need a real drink, bud.

35:37.930 --> 35:39.483
Let's get mobile.

35:42.390 --> 35:43.223
Come on.

35:53.580 --> 35:54.630
Where are we going?

35:58.640 --> 35:59.540
Close that door.

36:05.480 --> 36:06.313
We'll smoke this real quick.

36:06.314 --> 36:07.760
I don't wanna smoke in the car.

36:15.040 --> 36:16.709
'Bout the whole lifestyle thing,

36:16.710 --> 36:18.233
I guess the only downside,

36:19.130 --> 36:21.183
this whole lifestyle that I got,

36:23.010 --> 36:24.809
would be, you know, I know that there's

36:24.810 --> 36:29.130
this big city out there,
just livin' every night

36:31.021 --> 36:32.421
and I could be a part of it,

36:34.090 --> 36:35.773
but I don't.

36:37.380 --> 36:40.019
I just fuckin' kick back in the basement,

36:40.020 --> 36:41.370
wait for people to show up.

36:44.750 --> 36:47.533
I guess that's the only downside.

36:55.773 --> 36:56.892
You know what I mean?

37:07.741 --> 37:08.574
Whoa.

37:12.221 --> 37:14.009
That shit is rough.

37:14.010 --> 37:16.069
Oh yeah, bud, the worst.

37:16.070 --> 37:19.033
Fuckin' straight gasoline and asshole.

37:24.741 --> 37:26.719
Do you wanna hear a rap?

37:26.720 --> 37:27.553
Hell yeah.

37:27.553 --> 37:28.386
Yeah?

37:29.630 --> 37:31.249
So, you know how society is,

37:31.250 --> 37:33.249
says you need a wife and some kids,

37:33.250 --> 37:35.739
a nine to five, a house and a Prius.

37:35.740 --> 37:38.439
Tonight we're having steak,
tomorrow we're eatin' ribs

37:38.440 --> 37:40.743
and Lord knows it better be ready at six,

37:40.744 --> 37:44.162
'cause I'm a man and that's
what a man is, right?

37:44.163 --> 37:44.996
Yeah, okay.

37:44.997 --> 37:46.659
Yeah.

37:46.660 --> 37:48.719
See, you gotta compare
yourself to your neighbor,

37:48.720 --> 37:51.649
'cause there's rules and
guidelines and standards

37:51.650 --> 37:54.519
and if you don't follow 'em,
you're gonna get cancer.

37:54.520 --> 37:55.889
See, I got a lot of questions.

37:55.890 --> 37:57.529
I don't got a lot of answers.

37:57.530 --> 37:59.179
They say Jesus was a carpenter.

37:59.180 --> 38:00.573
I think he was a dancer.

38:02.171 --> 38:03.371
I'm not sure I follow.

38:05.710 --> 38:07.292
Mmm, sure bud.

38:07.293 --> 38:09.759
This life is a lot to swallow.

38:09.760 --> 38:12.359
That's why I tend to stick to the bottle.

38:12.360 --> 38:13.369
Tonight, I'll feel great.

38:13.370 --> 38:14.629
Tomorrow, I'll feel hollow.

38:14.630 --> 38:18.179
Shit, shower, maybe
shave, beg, steal, borrow.

38:18.180 --> 38:20.669
Last night I gave head
to a bum in a Bronco,

38:20.670 --> 38:23.434
followed it with Jack In
The Box and two tacos.

38:24.269 --> 38:25.939
You had me there for a sec.

38:25.940 --> 38:27.899
Now you lost me.

38:27.900 --> 38:29.919
Well sure, we're all lost, bud.

38:29.920 --> 38:32.399
It's trial and error
'til the clock's done.

38:32.400 --> 38:34.909
Then you go to heaven and
you can be what you want,

38:34.910 --> 38:36.389
do what you want, eat what you want,

38:36.390 --> 38:39.033
drop a deuce on the top of
a table in a restaurant.

38:40.080 --> 38:41.889
Rob a bank, make a run.

38:41.890 --> 38:44.540
I swear I'm a good guy, but
the devil's a lot of fun.

38:45.380 --> 38:46.213
That he is.

38:46.214 --> 38:48.359
Man, that's what it
is in this life of sin.

38:48.360 --> 38:51.126
Where everybody can't
even agree on what God is.

38:51.127 --> 38:54.089
The only thing I know
is that Karma's a bitch.

38:54.090 --> 38:57.763
They say everybody dies,
not everybody lives.

38:58.840 --> 39:02.359
Man, I just want a fuckin'
smooch of a whiskey

39:02.360 --> 39:03.999
and a puff of cannabis.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.383
Okay, maybe a house and a Prius.

39:07.280 --> 39:08.113
Amen.

39:09.140 --> 39:10.419
Should we get lost?

39:10.420 --> 39:11.253
Let's hit the road.

39:11.254 --> 39:12.309
All right, bud.

39:12.310 --> 39:13.739
All right, we need the tail.

39:13.740 --> 39:14.909
Okay, we got two on foot.

39:14.910 --> 39:16.559
I think that's our dealer and we need

39:16.560 --> 39:17.943
eyes on him, all right?

39:19.445 --> 39:20.300
You're not goin', Swish.

39:20.301 --> 39:22.159
Yeah, the fuck I'm not.

39:22.160 --> 39:23.663
Would you relax, Swish?

39:24.555 --> 39:27.019
You know, Jesus, you want me to slap you

39:27.020 --> 39:28.399
in front of Frye?

39:28.400 --> 39:31.369
Look, you can't go
because we don't want you

39:31.370 --> 39:32.320
to blow your cover.

39:33.320 --> 39:34.153
All right, you're right.

39:34.153 --> 39:35.133
You're fuckin' right.

39:35.980 --> 39:37.589
We're sending Frye.

39:37.590 --> 39:38.423
Me?

39:38.423 --> 39:39.351
You want me to go?

39:39.351 --> 39:40.184
Mmm.

39:40.185 --> 39:41.409
Yeah, Frye, get the fuck up

39:41.410 --> 39:43.379
and follow those hippies
before I lose this deal

39:43.380 --> 39:44.609
and I rip your arms off and use 'em

39:44.610 --> 39:46.737
as paddles for my fuckin' dingy.

39:54.200 --> 39:55.503
God, I fuckin' love that kid.

40:52.420 --> 40:53.263
Nice place.

40:54.350 --> 40:55.949
Yeah.

40:55.950 --> 40:57.163
Real nice place, bud.

40:58.440 --> 41:00.533
My favorite bar, my go to.

41:02.580 --> 41:05.463
There's quite the absence
of ladies around here.

41:09.459 --> 41:10.373
You want ladies,

41:12.117 --> 41:14.519
couple trollups to go, please.

41:14.520 --> 41:15.353
Lesbians.

41:18.019 --> 41:19.847
What do you mean?

41:19.848 --> 41:22.090
Those are not lesbians.

41:23.360 --> 41:24.599
See?

41:24.600 --> 41:25.483
Lesbians.

41:28.808 --> 41:29.641
Huh.

41:30.837 --> 41:34.535
Who doesn't like a couple of brunies, huh?

41:38.190 --> 41:39.030
Hey fellas.

41:39.030 --> 41:39.980

41:41.477 --> 41:46.010
Hey, let's do two
tequilas, two brews, please.

41:47.370 --> 41:48.759
No whiskey?

41:48.760 --> 41:50.329
Oh, fuck that man.

41:50.330 --> 41:51.173
We're at uh,

41:52.688 --> 41:53.521
we're at the bar.

41:53.522 --> 41:54.623
We drink whiskey at the house.

41:55.637 --> 41:59.003
When I'm away, take full
advantage of tastier beverage.

42:00.757 --> 42:01.590
Okay.

42:04.690 --> 42:05.523

42:32.860 --> 42:35.389
Uh, let's do tab.

42:35.390 --> 42:40.333
Um, gotta feelin' we'll be

42:42.690 --> 42:43.523
Cheers.

42:43.523 --> 42:44.356
Cheers.

42:52.190 --> 42:53.023
All right.

42:54.690 --> 42:56.694
What are you doin'?

42:56.695 --> 42:58.773
Little chat with the lesbians.

Hey.

How you doin'?

43:11.934 --> 43:14.267
Fine, how are you?

43:28.770 --> 43:30.529
I'd like to buy you a drink.

43:30.530 --> 43:31.480
What are we havin'?

43:34.040 --> 43:36.636
How 'bout tequila?

43:52.260 --> 43:54.763
Like to get four shots

43:58.710 --> 43:59.543
Limes?

44:06.080 --> 44:06.913
Cliff.

44:09.840 --> 44:11.423
Got a girlfriend, Cliff?

44:14.630 --> 44:17.214
Yeah, I got a girl.

44:45.140 --> 44:47.303
Here's to Cliff's girlfriend.

44:56.197 --> 44:57.030
Ah!

45:00.280 --> 45:02.623
Your girlfriend like bonfires, Cliff?

45:04.237 --> 45:05.799
Huh?

45:05.800 --> 45:08.499
I got some property outside of town.

45:08.500 --> 45:10.487
Real nice spread.

45:10.488 --> 45:12.639
You should bring your girlfriend by.

45:12.640 --> 45:14.199
We'll make up some drinks.

45:14.200 --> 45:18.229
We can get her drunk and
show her a real good time.

45:18.230 --> 45:19.993
I'll make a nice bonfire.

45:21.080 --> 45:22.603
My mom lives there, too.

45:23.600 --> 45:26.453
She won't bother us when I have guests.

45:39.150 --> 45:40.440
What the fuck is this?

45:41.725 --> 45:42.775
It's a blank check.

45:46.020 --> 45:47.853
The name on the check says Edith.

45:48.800 --> 45:49.633
Are you Edith?

45:50.700 --> 45:52.669
Edith is my mother.

45:52.670 --> 45:54.769
The check is signed.

45:54.770 --> 45:56.379
Frankly, my family's finances

45:56.380 --> 45:57.930
are none of your damn business.

46:01.440 --> 46:04.575
Did you have your
mother sign a blank check

46:04.576 --> 46:06.556
so you could go to the bar?

46:06.557 --> 46:09.157
Can I sign it for a hundred
over and get the cash?

46:14.370 --> 46:16.823
This is absolutely ridiculous,

46:19.340 --> 46:20.173
but yes.

46:21.764 --> 46:22.597
You can.

46:24.100 --> 46:26.589
But why does your mother pay your bar tab?

46:26.590 --> 46:29.539
All of my money is currently
wrapped up in investments

46:29.540 --> 46:32.099
or sitting in my mother's accounts.

46:32.100 --> 46:35.473
I could buy everything in
this bar if I wanted to.

46:39.990 --> 46:41.143
Your finances.

46:43.150 --> 46:46.483
I work three jobs trying to just get by.

46:47.873 --> 46:51.800
You're having your mother
writing checks so you can drink.

46:54.530 --> 46:56.929
Well, I guess your
parents should have made

46:56.930 --> 46:58.323
better life choices.

47:03.280 --> 47:04.879
What the fuck did you say?

47:04.880 --> 47:07.139
Can I get three more shots, the total

47:07.140 --> 47:09.943
and a hundred over so I can
have some spending cash?

47:22.400 --> 47:24.389
So, ladies.

47:24.390 --> 47:25.223
What do you think?

47:25.223 --> 47:26.056
We gonna do this?

47:29.660 --> 47:30.493
You know what?

47:30.494 --> 47:31.582
You're adorable, but you don't know

47:31.583 --> 47:33.053
what the fuck you're doing.

47:36.010 --> 47:37.343
Okay, listen here.

47:38.530 --> 47:42.180
The only reason that I came over here...

47:46.223 --> 47:48.556
Ooh, fair enough, all right.

47:53.055 --> 47:55.341
How'd it go, Romeo?

47:55.342 --> 47:56.781
Fuckin' lesbians.

49:14.790 --> 49:17.809
One, my soulmate and my partner in crime.

49:17.810 --> 49:21.199
The first was gorgeous, crazy smart.

49:21.200 --> 49:23.833
The second stole the keys to my heart.

49:24.860 --> 49:27.577
Now, both of these ladies
left me there cryin'.

49:28.730 --> 49:32.553
First one left me for a
tree trimmer named Brian.

49:32.554 --> 49:35.569
The second one rode off
with a cowboy named Kale.

49:35.570 --> 49:39.039
She did some meth, now she's in jail.

49:39.040 --> 49:43.779
So cheers to the gypsies,
hood rats and tramps.

49:43.780 --> 49:47.079

51:13.257 --> 51:16.291
Here's to Cliff's girlfriend.

51:18.920 --> 51:20.363
Sip a tip of whiskey.

51:24.000 --> 51:25.123
Suck it down, bud.

51:32.522 --> 51:33.355
Whoo.

51:35.503 --> 51:37.670
Wanna know why I drink it?

51:39.420 --> 51:42.783
My old man drank Kentucky
bourbon all his life.

51:44.360 --> 51:45.760
So, that's what I drink now.

51:47.190 --> 51:48.653
Tradition, I guess.

51:51.080 --> 51:54.283
What an absolutely horrible tradition.

51:56.700 --> 51:58.033
Come on, uno mas.

51:58.910 --> 51:59.773
Last one.

52:00.660 --> 52:02.270
For now.

52:06.800 --> 52:07.800
Fuck that.

52:10.191 --> 52:11.799
Look, I know it's not the best, bud,

52:11.800 --> 52:13.543
but you don't question tradition.

52:14.770 --> 52:16.720
We got the bourbon, you drink the burb.

52:19.640 --> 52:21.340
Know where I think you're wrong?

52:23.330 --> 52:24.913
Besides the bourbon, of course.

52:26.510 --> 52:29.523
I think you've got it
wrong outside this pad.

52:30.500 --> 52:32.779
There's an entire city out there,

52:32.780 --> 52:35.583
living every single night.

52:37.160 --> 52:39.819
Here you are, in your basement,

52:39.820 --> 52:41.483
playin' music with your friends.

52:42.470 --> 52:46.073
Out there, it's only temptation, girls,

52:47.150 --> 52:47.983
money.

52:49.620 --> 52:50.899
Girls, did I mention that?

52:50.900 --> 52:52.000
Mentioned the girls.

52:52.930 --> 52:56.499
Those people, they're all just

52:56.500 --> 52:59.289
wandering through the distractions,

52:59.290 --> 53:02.339
following their trends,
bunch of fuckin' sheep.

53:02.340 --> 53:03.390
Fuckin' sheep, bud.

53:04.780 --> 53:07.573
Here you are, playin' your music,

53:08.500 --> 53:12.363
havin' a good time,
avoiding those distractions.

53:13.970 --> 53:15.004
Yeah.

53:15.005 --> 53:17.839
Money, it's overrated, but clubs?

53:17.840 --> 53:18.993
They're overrated.

53:20.270 --> 53:22.879
Girls, well, they're...

53:22.880 --> 53:23.713
They're nice.

53:24.640 --> 53:25.640
They're out there.

53:27.960 --> 53:28.793
Yeah.

53:31.850 --> 53:33.150
I gotta get out more, bud.

53:34.548 --> 53:36.710
But hey, let's not
let all this girl talk

53:38.130 --> 53:42.913
get in the way of my drunken
mumblin' about money and life.

53:46.010 --> 53:46.843
I get it, man.

53:48.570 --> 53:49.403
Enjoy life.

53:50.600 --> 53:51.683
Money's overrated.

53:54.201 --> 53:55.034
Fuck.

53:57.470 --> 54:00.779
Every now and again, I
gotta get my stoner ass

54:00.780 --> 54:03.543
off the couch and taste the nectar.

54:05.910 --> 54:07.360
Let's get back to this party.

54:10.041 --> 54:10.874
Come on.

54:15.189 --> 54:16.297
Come on.

54:16.298 --> 54:17.965
Come on, whoo, whoo.

54:32.480 --> 54:33.878
Hey, hey.

54:33.879 --> 54:35.736
Maija, hey.

54:35.737 --> 54:37.256
Hey.

54:37.257 --> 54:38.199
Maija.

54:39.033 --> 54:40.589
Hey, I know you're scared.

54:40.590 --> 54:41.503
I'm scared, too.

54:42.700 --> 54:43.533
What do we do?

54:43.534 --> 54:45.918
What do we do when we're scared?

54:45.919 --> 54:49.038
What do we do when we're scared?

54:49.039 --> 54:49.872
Huh?

54:50.810 --> 54:52.369
We flow.

54:52.370 --> 54:54.548
What do we do when we're scared?

54:57.098 --> 54:58.849
We flow.

54:58.850 --> 55:00.430
We flow.

55:00.431 --> 55:03.399
We fight, we fight, we fight.

55:03.400 --> 55:05.139
We flow.

55:05.140 --> 55:06.929
We flow.

55:06.930 --> 55:08.663
We fight, we fight, we fight.

55:10.338 --> 55:11.171
Okay?

55:11.172 --> 55:12.779
You remember this.

55:12.780 --> 55:13.643
We flow.

55:14.638 --> 55:16.179
We flow.

55:16.180 --> 55:18.033
We fight, we fight, we fight.

55:19.770 --> 55:21.089
We flow.

55:21.090 --> 55:22.889
We flow.

55:22.890 --> 55:24.653
We fight, we fight, we fight.

55:27.710 --> 55:28.543
You got it.

55:29.630 --> 55:30.513
We flow.

55:31.431 --> 55:32.283
We flow.

55:33.191 --> 55:36.609
We fight, we fight, we fight.

55:36.610 --> 55:37.663
We flow.

55:38.639 --> 55:39.472
We flow.

55:40.431 --> 55:43.237
We fight, we fight, we fight.

55:44.608 --> 55:45.441
We flow.

55:46.479 --> 55:47.312
We flow.

55:48.158 --> 55:50.407
We fight, we fight, we fight.

56:02.410 --> 56:03.243
Oh!

56:04.478 --> 56:05.311
Nice.

56:09.888 --> 56:12.197
Did you have a nice trip?

56:22.770 --> 56:23.603
Well, amigos,

56:24.930 --> 56:26.143
I'm pretty intoxicated.

56:27.910 --> 56:30.399
Feel like maybe we should smoke about it.

56:30.400 --> 56:31.233
Hey, great.

56:39.759 --> 56:41.743
Ah, some bitch.

56:42.700 --> 56:44.523
All right, I'll get it.

56:47.958 --> 56:48.791
Be right back.

57:20.894 --> 57:21.727
Hey.

57:23.730 --> 57:24.563
Relax.

57:26.014 --> 57:28.559
None of us know what's gonna happen.

57:28.560 --> 57:31.103
That is what makes life so great.

57:34.603 --> 57:35.829
Will you please hand me that joint?

57:35.830 --> 57:39.143
Klaus is way too gone to put
marijuana into the equation.

57:59.600 --> 58:02.810
So, I've gotten to know your

58:04.340 --> 58:05.173
friend.

58:10.375 --> 58:12.792
So would you please sit down?

58:14.760 --> 58:16.373
You're startin' to freak me out.

58:18.735 --> 58:20.699
It'd be nice to get to know you

58:20.700 --> 58:24.173
while we're all enjoying this moment.

58:28.730 --> 58:29.573
So sit down.

58:45.710 --> 58:47.287
Listen, darlin'.

58:48.710 --> 58:51.609
My little friend over
here is quite adorable,

58:51.610 --> 58:54.393
but me, I'm not a people person.

58:56.200 --> 58:57.903
I don't like people.

59:00.250 --> 59:04.729
Don't have any stories,
and I definitely can't

59:04.730 --> 59:08.513
give you anything in this special moment.

59:20.300 --> 59:21.800
I have to ask you something.

59:22.986 --> 59:24.569
Hey guys.

59:26.814 --> 59:28.314
To be continued.

59:57.790 --> 59:59.540
Who are these guys?

01:00:02.050 --> 01:00:04.339
We got Cliff, we got Otis.

01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:05.202
Go ahead.

01:00:06.036 --> 01:00:08.033
Put your fuckin' butt down,
let me roll this joint.

01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:12.363
Who are these guys?

01:00:15.570 --> 01:00:18.039
It's a good thing
you're beautiful, Petra.

01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:19.950
We've already done this.

01:00:37.290 --> 01:00:38.123
Well, listen.

01:00:39.490 --> 01:00:43.333
There's a pretty good chance
that I'm a little drunk.

01:00:44.310 --> 01:00:47.163
Maybe not a little, I'm
really fucking drunk.

01:00:48.450 --> 01:00:50.359
I can vouch for that.

01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:52.569
We might have taken the
attention of several

01:00:52.570 --> 01:00:56.459
Sigma Nu's at ladies' night
in a shit hole bar downtown

01:00:56.460 --> 01:01:01.239
to the liberty of three to
a half dozen lemon drops.

01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:03.199
I don't know why, but
frat boys will take out

01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:04.959
a second student loan
when you wear a shirt

01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:06.942
that almost exposes a nipple.

01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:13.613
I'm guessing that
effect works on all men.

01:01:15.401 --> 01:01:20.123
Well, this here should relax everybody.

01:01:24.350 --> 01:01:27.533
These girls can be a
real fuckin' headache.

01:01:30.430 --> 01:01:33.419
But they're not that
bad when they're stoned.

01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:35.103
Super slutty, though.

01:01:42.223 --> 01:01:43.056
Bud.

01:01:44.172 --> 01:01:46.079
You need to take this seat.

01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:46.913
Hot seat.

01:01:48.490 --> 01:01:49.800
There.

01:01:49.801 --> 01:01:51.718
Sorry, sorry.

01:02:03.550 --> 01:02:04.523
Go to the bars?

01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:06.709
No.

01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:08.000
The clubs?

01:02:08.001 --> 01:02:08.834
Nope.

01:02:09.670 --> 01:02:10.933
House parties.

01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:14.553
Why not?

01:02:17.132 --> 01:02:18.753
I don't really like people.

01:02:20.300 --> 01:02:21.563
You don't like people?

01:02:22.450 --> 01:02:24.743
But you're here, with people.

01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:29.386
Once in a while I meet someone who's

01:02:29.387 --> 01:02:30.603
not so bad.

01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:33.643
Hmm, I love people.

01:02:35.091 --> 01:02:37.793
How can you not like people?

01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:39.847
I hate people, too.

01:02:39.848 --> 01:02:41.673
No, no, no, no, no.

01:02:43.090 --> 01:02:44.309
You're lyin' bitch.

01:02:44.310 --> 01:02:46.669
We go out every fucking night.

01:02:46.670 --> 01:02:49.289
That's because I love sex.

01:02:49.290 --> 01:02:51.380
I hate the majority of people, though.

01:02:51.381 --> 01:02:53.723
Gotcha hater.

01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:55.700
Well, what about me?

01:02:57.100 --> 01:02:58.823
Huh, what about me?

01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:01.793
You?

01:03:02.690 --> 01:03:04.080
I'd hit it.

01:03:04.081 --> 01:03:05.360
Stop.

01:03:05.361 --> 01:03:07.028
Fuck yeah.

01:03:08.370 --> 01:03:10.079
All right, what's your
stance on love, then,

01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:12.380
since you know, you don't
like people and all.

01:03:15.300 --> 01:03:16.543
That's a tricky one.

01:03:18.521 --> 01:03:20.919
I don't think there's really
a correct answer to love.

01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:23.263
I suppose I'm for it.

01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:28.783
But then, you've got those
fuckin' smug couples,

01:03:29.710 --> 01:03:32.269
suburban, two stories, Range Rovers,

01:03:32.270 --> 01:03:34.999
stupid fuckin' Pinterest,

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.083
decorations all over their front porch.

01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:38.873
Nah.

01:03:40.030 --> 01:03:41.589
Changed my mind.

01:03:41.590 --> 01:03:42.719
I don't love love.

01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:46.699
Okay, there's nothing
wrong with Pinterest.

01:03:46.700 --> 01:03:49.049
Okay, you hate people.

01:03:49.050 --> 01:03:51.429
You don't believe in love, what's next?

01:03:51.430 --> 01:03:53.713
Are you gonna tell me you hate sex?

01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:55.473
No, no, no.

01:03:55.474 --> 01:03:58.339
Absolutely am obsessed with sex.

01:03:58.340 --> 01:04:00.119
Mmm, me too.

01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:04.713
Okay, are you more of a
breast man or an ass man?

01:04:05.550 --> 01:04:06.893
Breasts, duh.

01:04:09.370 --> 01:04:13.040
You know, I don't know if
it's because I'm so drunk,

01:04:13.041 --> 01:04:15.833
but I'm finding you
incredibly sexy right now.

01:04:18.340 --> 01:04:20.053
You are super drunk, though.

01:04:21.150 --> 01:04:22.253

you like me to sing about?

01:11:35.475 --> 01:11:36.352
Sure.

01:11:36.352 --> 01:11:37.185
Jocelyn.

01:11:37.186 --> 01:11:38.460
'Til next time.

01:11:38.461 --> 01:11:39.502
Sweetheart.

01:11:39.503 --> 01:11:42.039
We should get together and
have coffee soon, okay?

01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:42.873
Coffee.

01:11:42.874 --> 01:11:44.113
Just, you know, drinks.

01:11:45.562 --> 01:11:46.395
Bye.

01:11:46.396 --> 01:11:47.880
See ya.

01:11:47.881 --> 01:11:49.001
Bye, Klaus.

01:11:49.002 --> 01:11:50.752
It's good to see you.

01:11:51.750 --> 01:11:53.809
Come on, let's go.

01:11:53.810 --> 01:11:54.643
Bye.

How 'bout you help me
grab some beers, homie?

01:13:06.770 --> 01:13:07.603
Oh.

01:13:09.180 --> 01:13:10.013
Okay.

01:13:12.660 --> 01:13:13.493
Bye.

01:13:27.010 --> 01:13:28.847
What the fuck are you doing?

01:13:31.100 --> 01:13:34.109
Don't tell me we're still
goin' through with this.

01:13:34.110 --> 01:13:35.659
We will.

01:13:35.660 --> 01:13:36.763
We have to.

01:13:39.290 --> 01:13:40.223
No, we don't.

01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:43.609
You like Chris.

01:13:43.610 --> 01:13:46.703
You don't like anybody, but you like him.

01:13:48.140 --> 01:13:49.363
These are good people.

01:13:50.470 --> 01:13:52.113
Just wanna fuck up their lives?

01:13:55.220 --> 01:13:56.053
I know what this is about,

01:13:56.054 --> 01:13:57.893
and don't you fuckin' lie to me.

01:13:59.690 --> 01:14:01.969
You're fallin' for that broad.

01:14:01.970 --> 01:14:04.270
That why you don't wanna
go through with this?

01:14:06.090 --> 01:14:08.743
I haven't met anybody
that is that amazing.

01:14:10.420 --> 01:14:13.929
I can be myself around
her, and she likes it.

01:14:13.930 --> 01:14:15.243
She really likes it.

01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:19.913
I feel I can touch her,
I can feel her heart.

01:14:21.370 --> 01:14:22.683
It's indescribable.

01:14:24.410 --> 01:14:26.489
Well, sorry.

01:14:26.490 --> 01:14:27.683
We're fuckin' doin' it.

01:14:30.590 --> 01:14:31.423
No.

01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:34.119
We can just run.

01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:34.973
We can leave.

01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:37.553
It's not too late.

01:14:37.554 --> 01:14:40.009
We can get the fuck outta here,

01:14:40.010 --> 01:14:43.189
and not fuck up her future,

01:14:43.190 --> 01:14:44.640
fuck up these peoples' lives.

01:14:46.350 --> 01:14:47.803
You wanna walk.

01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:51.329
No, no, no, no, no.

01:14:51.330 --> 01:14:54.853
Tonight's about to get very
dark for our new friends.

01:15:14.089 --> 01:15:15.909
We missed another deal.

01:15:15.910 --> 01:15:18.629
How the fuck did we miss another deal?

01:15:18.630 --> 01:15:22.339
What the fuck are you
doing here, Frye, all right?

01:15:22.340 --> 01:15:25.729
We just needed a dollop of
evidence, just skosh, all right?

01:15:25.730 --> 01:15:29.159
We sent in the biggest ears
on the mother fuckin' force

01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:31.159
and we got jack shit.

01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:33.949
Do your mother fucking job, Frye.

01:15:33.950 --> 01:15:34.930
Keep it up, Frye.

01:15:34.931 --> 01:15:36.819
You're doin' just fine.

01:15:36.820 --> 01:15:38.899
Hey, Swish.

01:15:38.900 --> 01:15:40.399
They're not talkin'.

01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:42.089
They're doin' deals, we know that,

01:15:42.090 --> 01:15:44.569
but they're just not
verbalizing the exchange.

01:15:44.570 --> 01:15:47.979
So, would you just mellow
out your Viagra withdrawals

01:15:47.980 --> 01:15:52.809
and let me and Frye
just relax, here, Jesus.

01:15:52.810 --> 01:15:54.063
Jesus Christ.

01:15:54.900 --> 01:15:58.269
Feel like I'm babysitting
a six foot tall limp dick.

01:15:58.270 --> 01:15:59.999
Six foot one, asshole.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:01.269
And why don't you go fuck up

01:16:01.270 --> 01:16:03.849
some other single mother's
life, fuckin' prick.

01:16:03.850 --> 01:16:07.689
Hey, Frye, please don't
use Detective Swisher

01:16:07.690 --> 01:16:08.979
as an example of a detective

01:16:08.980 --> 01:16:11.409
that we should all know and love.

01:16:11.410 --> 01:16:12.929
God.

01:16:12.930 --> 01:16:14.439
And just so we're all clear,

01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:17.233
I never fucked up anybody's life.

01:16:18.070 --> 01:16:21.739
I feel like it was merely a life's lesson

01:16:21.740 --> 01:16:23.439
in those women's lives
that they shouldn't let

01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:27.279
an officer with bad intentions or,

01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:29.949
or insatiable sexual
appetite into their lives

01:16:29.950 --> 01:16:32.713
if they're not willing to commit.

01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:36.923
Women, and their commitment issues.

01:16:38.769 --> 01:16:39.633
It's baffling.

01:16:51.230 --> 01:16:54.313
Oh God, I must look like
a total mess right now.

01:16:55.510 --> 01:16:59.513
I, Otis, I don't know how
my life got to this moment.

01:17:03.950 --> 01:17:05.963
I'm just so scared for Maija,

01:17:06.850 --> 01:17:11.369
and she must see that fear
every single time I look at her,

01:17:11.370 --> 01:17:13.429
but I can't help it.

01:17:13.430 --> 01:17:15.399
She's my baby.

01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:17.900
She's the most important
thing in the world to me,

01:17:18.950 --> 01:17:22.177
and I can't do anything to help her.

01:17:22.178 --> 01:17:25.549
I can't do anything to make her better.

01:17:25.550 --> 01:17:29.509
I just have to sit and
watch her slowly suffer.

01:17:29.510 --> 01:17:32.750
I know that one day I'm gonna wake up

01:17:34.150 --> 01:17:35.483
and she'll be...

01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:41.513
Hey,

01:17:42.770 --> 01:17:43.793
I feel the same way.

01:17:45.250 --> 01:17:46.173
I'm scared, too,

01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:49.639
but I wanna spend

01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:51.949
the rest of the time
that we have with Maija

01:17:51.950 --> 01:17:53.003
watching her smile.

01:17:54.890 --> 01:17:56.449
I'm so happy you found your way

01:17:56.450 --> 01:17:57.540
into her life.

01:18:00.378 --> 01:18:01.211
Hey, oh.

01:18:03.738 --> 01:18:05.247
Your water, Klaus.

01:18:06.790 --> 01:18:09.023
Don't need any alcohol cloudin' that trip.

01:18:14.108 --> 01:18:14.941
All right.

01:18:17.943 --> 01:18:18.800
Cheers.

01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:19.643
What a night.

01:18:21.130 --> 01:18:22.280
Well, hell yeah, bud.

01:18:23.140 --> 01:18:25.799
I mean, here we are, night after night,

01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:27.579
just jammin' out, playin' our music

01:18:27.580 --> 01:18:30.873
and in walk you two, agitatin' the peace,

01:18:31.770 --> 01:18:32.873
in a good way, bud.

01:18:34.380 --> 01:18:38.139
Okay, I will tell you a

01:18:38.140 --> 01:18:40.599
part, but you can't have all of it,

01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:41.433
not tonight.

01:18:44.310 --> 01:18:45.905
Huh?

01:18:45.906 --> 01:18:46.823
My story?

01:18:47.855 --> 01:18:49.055
You still wanna hear it?

01:18:50.855 --> 01:18:51.733
Oh, yeah.

01:18:53.900 --> 01:18:56.680
Okay, try and stay with me

01:18:57.670 --> 01:18:58.503
for the journey.

01:19:00.015 --> 01:19:00.848
So...

01:19:55.010 --> 01:19:57.260
Where are
you headed, little lady?

01:19:58.908 --> 01:20:02.529
Well, headed wherever life takes me.

01:20:02.530 --> 01:20:05.683
Guess my destination is
getting a bit lost for a while.

01:20:07.137 --> 01:20:10.743
All right, I'm headed 120 miles north.

01:20:12.767 --> 01:20:14.135
Wanna lift?

01:20:44.015 --> 01:20:47.015
So, where are you from, little lady?

01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:50.399
All over the place.

01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:52.083
I've been everywhere.

01:20:55.310 --> 01:20:56.319
All right.

01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:58.070
How long have you been on the road?

01:20:59.026 --> 01:21:00.759
A little over three years.

01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:03.413
Three years, oh my.

01:21:06.210 --> 01:21:09.483
You ain't headed any place special?

01:21:10.458 --> 01:21:11.958
You're just going?

01:21:13.820 --> 01:21:16.203
It sounds cliche, but,

01:21:17.630 --> 01:21:19.289
I needed to get away from life

01:21:19.290 --> 01:21:21.093
and start really living, you know?

01:21:22.260 --> 01:21:25.217
I like that, and you
ain't running from nothin'?

01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:27.720
You didn't kill anybody did you?

01:21:29.716 --> 01:21:30.549
Not yet.

01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:36.656
I'm just joking, I'm not
running away from anything.

01:21:36.680 --> 01:21:38.749
I guess I just wanted to explore the world

01:21:38.750 --> 01:21:42.323
for a while and I'm not satisfied yet.

01:21:45.530 --> 01:21:47.253
The road is a rough place,

01:21:49.643 --> 01:21:54.393
and it's gonna be especially
rough on a girl like you.

01:21:56.050 --> 01:21:58.509
Yeah, I've had a few scary nights,

01:21:58.510 --> 01:22:02.669
but it's made me tough,
plus, at this point,

01:22:02.670 --> 01:22:05.893
I don't think I can live with
any more fear in my heart, so,

01:22:06.738 --> 01:22:08.583
my heart's at peace.

01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:11.270
This heart's wild and free.

01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:14.420
I believe you, little lady.

01:22:15.260 --> 01:22:17.897
Just take care of yourself, you hear?

01:23:10.455 --> 01:23:11.724
Evenin'.

01:23:11.725 --> 01:23:12.558
Hi, thanks for stopping.

01:23:12.559 --> 01:23:15.109
Hey yeah, thank you so much.

01:23:15.110 --> 01:23:16.819
You're most certainly welcome.

01:23:16.820 --> 01:23:19.873
Name's Charlie, driver
here goes by Catfish.

01:23:21.490 --> 01:23:22.590
Where you guys headed?

01:23:24.340 --> 01:23:26.119
We don't really have a destination, man,

01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:28.109
we're just kinda traveling, but,

01:23:28.110 --> 01:23:29.803
the next town'd be really great.

01:23:33.607 --> 01:23:35.513
Sure, I think we can help you out.

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:39.529
Wait.

01:23:39.530 --> 01:23:40.889
Wait.

01:23:40.890 --> 01:23:43.040
What are we gonna get
out of this, sweetie?

01:23:45.330 --> 01:23:46.449
What are you doin', man?

01:23:46.450 --> 01:23:49.849
We're givin' you and
your pretty girl a ride.

01:23:49.850 --> 01:23:52.809
This is a huge inconvenience for us.

01:23:52.810 --> 01:23:55.579
Don't you think we should
get some sorta reward?

01:23:55.580 --> 01:23:57.833
You know, for the chivalry of it?

01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:03.419
Hey, fuck you, man.

01:24:03.420 --> 01:24:04.979
We'll wait for the next car.

01:24:04.980 --> 01:24:05.813
Fuck me?

01:24:05.814 --> 01:24:07.699
No, fuck you, you dirty fuckin' hippie.

01:24:07.700 --> 01:24:09.414
How 'bout we take your
little slut for a ride?

01:24:09.415 --> 01:24:10.904
Get the fuck outta here, man.

01:24:10.905 --> 01:24:12.446
We don't want your chivalry, asshole.

01:24:12.447 --> 01:24:13.280
Asshole?

01:24:39.007 --> 01:24:41.507
Hey, thanks a lot.

01:24:44.396 --> 01:24:45.679
Hey, you wanna go
grab us somethin' to eat

01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:48.393
and I'll go look for a place
to set up our sleepin' bags?

01:24:48.394 --> 01:24:49.375
Oh, yeah.

01:24:49.375 --> 01:24:50.208
You know,

01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:53.469
this is exactly where we're
supposed to be in life,

01:24:53.470 --> 01:24:55.219
eating microwave burritos and sleeping

01:24:55.220 --> 01:24:56.453
behind a gas station.

01:24:57.730 --> 01:25:00.313
Sarcasm and you are not a good mix.

01:25:00.314 --> 01:25:01.147
Sorry.

01:27:03.403 --> 01:27:04.513
Hey, how are you?

01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:06.950
Livin' my dream.

01:27:06.951 --> 01:27:08.368
Four twenty nine.

01:27:13.283 --> 01:27:14.116
Thanks a lot.

01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:01.529
There's my girl.

01:28:01.530 --> 01:28:03.239
Come on over, sweetie.

01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:04.233
Join the party.

01:28:05.714 --> 01:28:07.993
Shane, Shane!

01:28:07.994 --> 01:28:09.959
I've always wanted
to fuck a hippie slut,

01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:12.461
and your bitch of a
boyfriend can watch, too.

01:28:20.422 --> 01:28:21.521
Fuck you.

01:28:23.394 --> 01:28:24.661
No, no, sweetie.

01:28:24.662 --> 01:28:26.622
We're gonna fuck you.

01:28:36.850 --> 01:28:37.683
Stop!

01:28:40.740 --> 01:28:41.690
Stop.

01:28:41.691 --> 01:28:43.460
Get the fuck outta here.

01:28:49.070 --> 01:28:50.763
Go away, you crazy fuck.

01:28:57.562 --> 01:28:59.692
Thank you.

01:28:59.693 --> 01:29:01.049
No need to thank me.

01:29:01.050 --> 01:29:02.953
We've all needed help.

01:29:02.954 --> 01:29:04.121
Just, Shane.

01:29:05.772 --> 01:29:06.605
Shane.

01:29:06.606 --> 01:29:08.719
Oh my God, oh my God.

01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:11.250
He's gone, I never saw him again.

01:29:12.130 --> 01:29:12.963
Yeah.

01:29:16.550 --> 01:29:17.383
Whoa.

01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:20.689
That's

01:29:20.690 --> 01:29:22.209
fuckin'

01:29:22.210 --> 01:29:23.813
incredibly crazy.

01:29:28.190 --> 01:29:29.913
What happened with you and Shane?

01:29:36.380 --> 01:29:40.473
Tonight, you only get
a piece of the story.

01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:47.960
Did you just tell a story
where you were saved by Jesus?

01:29:50.490 --> 01:29:51.323
Yeah.

01:29:55.880 --> 01:29:57.373
Well, cool story.

01:29:58.223 --> 01:29:59.550
How 'bout we

01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:03.573
get our noses dirty
with this here bam-bam?

01:30:06.220 --> 01:30:07.053
Allow me.

01:30:12.773 --> 01:30:14.393
Yah!

01:30:14.394 --> 01:30:15.394
Hold this.

01:30:23.860 --> 01:30:25.017
Oh my God.

01:30:31.670 --> 01:30:33.729
Uh.

01:30:33.730 --> 01:30:35.219
No.

01:30:35.220 --> 01:30:36.919
Uh,

01:30:36.920 --> 01:30:37.923
thanks but,

01:30:41.277 --> 01:30:42.360
no, I'm good.

01:30:43.716 --> 01:30:44.549
Okay.

01:31:18.058 --> 01:31:19.459
Hey.

01:31:19.460 --> 01:31:20.293
Listen up.

01:31:23.089 --> 01:31:26.918
Yeah, you know I don't have a
lot of life lessons to live.

01:31:26.919 --> 01:31:28.987
Oh hell, any sense at all, really man.

01:31:31.720 --> 01:31:32.707
I can tell you how to survive in this

01:31:32.708 --> 01:31:34.843
fucked up world for as long as possible.

01:31:37.660 --> 01:31:40.603
That's our tale for today,
old buddy, survival handbook.

01:31:42.030 --> 01:31:43.723
All right, rule number one.

01:31:45.490 --> 01:31:47.119
Don't trust anybody that has anything

01:31:47.120 --> 01:31:49.229
to do with the government.

01:31:49.230 --> 01:31:50.609
Now, I'm serious, anybody okay?

01:31:50.610 --> 01:31:51.443
Don't do it.

01:31:51.444 --> 01:31:52.729
All right, they're not to be trusted.

01:31:52.730 --> 01:31:54.269
Don't even think about it, you know?

01:31:54.270 --> 01:31:58.539
It starts with the career
politicians and fuckin' police

01:31:58.540 --> 01:32:01.053
and trickles down to the
courts and the judges.

01:32:03.031 --> 01:32:05.663
Hell son, I don't even
trust the garbage men.

01:32:07.640 --> 01:32:08.540
No?

01:32:08.540 --> 01:32:09.440
Hell no.

01:32:17.310 --> 01:32:19.069
You don't trust our garbage man?

01:32:19.070 --> 01:32:20.193
No, I don't.

01:32:23.898 --> 01:32:25.459
Okay, I guess you can
trust the garbage man,

01:32:25.460 --> 01:32:27.929
but only 'cause he's seen
how much I drink to get by

01:32:27.930 --> 01:32:30.443
and maintain sanity in
this fucked up world.

01:32:32.757 --> 01:32:34.407
You can't trust his boss, though.

01:32:35.610 --> 01:32:36.882
All right, now that we
got lesson number one

01:32:36.883 --> 01:32:38.923
out of the way, lesson number two.

01:32:40.660 --> 01:32:43.183
Most people in this world
don't give a fuck about you.

01:32:44.270 --> 01:32:46.349
Not your so-called
friends, even your family.

01:32:46.350 --> 01:32:49.319
Hell, pretty sure all my
cousins wish I was dead

01:32:49.320 --> 01:32:52.686
or disabled, I don't know.

01:32:52.687 --> 01:32:53.799
Friends?

01:32:53.800 --> 01:32:55.209
I don't have any friends.

01:32:55.210 --> 01:32:57.269
Had 'em, I don't care, all right?

01:32:57.270 --> 01:32:58.829
Some come and go, you know?

01:32:58.830 --> 01:33:01.449
Some pass on, some go the way of meth.

01:33:01.450 --> 01:33:03.189
Some of 'em became part of the problem

01:33:03.190 --> 01:33:04.913
that is the government.

01:33:06.290 --> 01:33:08.399
Dad, you're rambling on.

01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:10.959
I'm not rambling, I'm preachin'.

01:33:10.960 --> 01:33:12.429
I like my friends, Dad.

01:33:12.430 --> 01:33:13.909
What about Otis?

01:33:13.910 --> 01:33:15.419
I'm not suggestin' you gotta become

01:33:15.420 --> 01:33:16.923
a hermit there, Clifford.

01:33:19.746 --> 01:33:22.169
I'm just sayin' the
good ones stick around.

01:33:22.170 --> 01:33:23.003
Hold on to those.

01:33:23.004 --> 01:33:24.817
They're gonna come and go, you know?

01:33:26.767 --> 01:33:27.926
The good ones'll stick around.

01:33:29.640 --> 01:33:31.263
Even Otis, ah that kid's weird.

01:33:32.850 --> 01:33:34.609
He'll stick to ya, like family, you know?

01:33:34.610 --> 01:33:36.653
He'd die for ya, you know that?

01:33:38.850 --> 01:33:40.450
And when you find the good ones,

01:33:41.570 --> 01:33:44.823
and they're there, you hold on to those,

01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:47.353
like a brother.

01:33:49.570 --> 01:33:51.179
I will, Dad.

01:33:51.180 --> 01:33:52.393
Any more lessons?

01:33:57.460 --> 01:33:59.613
I don't wanna try and
change who you are, Cliff.

01:34:02.140 --> 01:34:02.997
I mean, why would I?

01:34:02.998 --> 01:34:04.233
You know, you're good, kid.

01:34:10.016 --> 01:34:12.227
I want you to go your own path, you know?

01:34:15.150 --> 01:34:16.100
Hopefully, I...

01:34:18.554 --> 01:34:19.654
you know, inspire you.

01:34:22.243 --> 01:34:26.140
Hell, it's no big secret
I made a lot of mistakes.

01:34:28.690 --> 01:34:30.769
Yeah, I don't want you to,

01:34:30.770 --> 01:34:32.259
don't let me try to lead
your path, you know?

01:34:32.260 --> 01:34:34.439
I just,

01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:36.653
just wanna try to give you
some guidelines, that's all.

01:34:38.670 --> 01:34:41.419
Shit, maybe it oughta
be called the official

01:34:41.420 --> 01:34:43.280
handbook of what not to do, huh?

01:34:44.450 --> 01:34:46.153
Dad, you're so weird.

01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:50.070
Yeah, I am weird, son, thank you.

01:34:52.490 --> 01:34:54.040
You gotta seek out the weirdos.

01:34:55.110 --> 01:34:59.233
One percent, the elite,
find the weird souls.

01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:01.899
It's weird people that shaped me,

01:35:01.900 --> 01:35:03.050
made me who I am today.

01:35:03.952 --> 01:35:05.549
You know, the non-conformists that they

01:35:05.550 --> 01:35:07.043
guide and shape society.

01:35:08.870 --> 01:35:10.520
Well, here's the rule number one.

01:35:11.770 --> 01:35:13.023
Fuck society.

01:35:14.170 --> 01:35:16.069
Lessons and guidelines, Dad,

01:35:16.070 --> 01:35:18.143
sounds an awful lot like the government.

01:35:22.820 --> 01:35:24.593
Yeah, hold on to
that thought there, buddy.

01:35:25.690 --> 01:35:27.407
Dad, what are we doin'?

01:35:29.413 --> 01:35:30.913
Don't you do it.

01:35:31.803 --> 01:35:34.549
Don't you do it, you fucking
bastard, don't you...

01:35:34.550 --> 01:35:36.983
Dad, should we call the cops?

01:35:38.130 --> 01:35:40.393
No, son, we're just
gonna sit here and wait.

01:35:41.580 --> 01:35:42.713
Hope nothin' happens.

01:35:44.220 --> 01:35:45.529
Sometimes in life you'll find yourself

01:35:45.530 --> 01:35:47.530
in situations where you just gotta wait,

01:35:49.420 --> 01:35:50.680
or you can run and hide

01:35:52.530 --> 01:35:54.093
or call some chicken shit cop.

01:35:56.482 --> 01:35:57.999
Or,

01:35:58.000 --> 01:35:58.833
you gotta fight.

01:36:00.149 --> 01:36:01.969
Tell your mom I love her.

01:36:15.270 --> 01:36:16.103
Dad!

01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:21.073
Dad!

01:36:31.160 --> 01:36:32.210
You all right, bud?

01:36:33.810 --> 01:36:36.143
Need to take a little break?

01:36:43.443 --> 01:36:44.276
Chris.

01:36:47.773 --> 01:36:49.023
What?

01:36:50.815 --> 01:36:54.219
Can you roll a joint for Cliff, please?

01:36:54.220 --> 01:36:56.593
He's gone right now, like,

01:36:56.594 --> 01:36:58.449
out of the atmosphere fuckin' gone.

01:36:58.450 --> 01:37:00.490
It's equally freaking me out

01:37:02.190 --> 01:37:03.603
and intriguing me out,

01:37:05.260 --> 01:37:06.560
but please mellow him out.

01:37:10.466 --> 01:37:12.716
All right, I got ya, bud.

01:37:33.296 --> 01:37:34.463
Hey, hey, hey.

01:37:35.410 --> 01:37:36.913
I got him, don't worry.

01:37:50.990 --> 01:37:52.143
Come on, Cliffy boy.

01:38:18.660 --> 01:38:22.443
Look, I'm not really
good with words, Otis.

01:38:24.780 --> 01:38:26.793
I'm so sorry for the bad news.

01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:33.319
I know how much Maija means to you

01:38:33.320 --> 01:38:34.153
and I know,

01:38:36.420 --> 01:38:38.973
I know how much you mean to her.

01:38:42.430 --> 01:38:44.337
I guess what I'm...

01:38:45.320 --> 01:38:47.199
I'm about to fuckin'
lose the only person

01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:49.519
in this world that made it feel like

01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:50.820
it was worth fightin' for.

01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:55.763
She makes me smile when I wake up.

01:38:56.640 --> 01:38:59.153
She shouldn't have made
it this far, but she did.

01:39:01.999 --> 01:39:02.832
Maija.

01:39:03.920 --> 01:39:05.283
She's so fuckin' stubborn.

01:39:08.760 --> 01:39:12.513
But because of that, because
she's so fuckin' stubborn,

01:39:14.350 --> 01:39:18.679
I got to meet her, care for her.

01:39:18.680 --> 01:39:19.523
I love her.

01:39:20.970 --> 01:39:22.483
She's like my little sister.

01:39:26.210 --> 01:39:28.093
I think it was no coincidence,

01:39:30.430 --> 01:39:32.773
that stubbornness was no coincidence.

01:39:34.857 --> 01:39:35.857
I think it was fate,

01:39:38.590 --> 01:39:41.140
so that I could see that
life's worth fightin' for.

01:39:42.610 --> 01:39:43.463
Every day,

01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:46.693
worth dyin' for,

01:39:48.250 --> 01:39:50.593
for every moment with those you love.

01:39:59.287 --> 01:40:01.087
How long did the doctors give her?

01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:05.293
Proper medications and treatments,

01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:09.283
it'll be soon, very soon.

01:40:11.520 --> 01:40:12.353
But,

01:40:13.580 --> 01:40:14.653
there's a chance.

01:40:15.500 --> 01:40:16.333
Yeah.

01:40:17.410 --> 01:40:19.573
That's the fucked up part
about this whole thing.

01:40:22.150 --> 01:40:24.359
She can survive on those medications

01:40:24.360 --> 01:40:26.353
and those goddamn treatments,

01:40:27.380 --> 01:40:29.203
but they're so fuckin' expensive.

01:40:31.870 --> 01:40:32.703
Ugh!

01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:34.753
Her mom's,

01:40:35.856 --> 01:40:36.763
her mom's broke.

01:40:37.718 --> 01:40:40.250
She sunk every dollar into her care

01:40:42.250 --> 01:40:43.650
and she's not strong enough.

01:40:46.650 --> 01:40:47.850
She's not strong enough.

01:40:57.627 --> 01:40:58.460
Hey.

01:41:01.776 --> 01:41:03.359
You wanna get high?

01:41:18.238 --> 01:41:19.488
So that's it?

01:41:28.467 --> 01:41:29.925
Yeah?

01:41:37.822 --> 01:41:38.655
That's it.

01:41:51.080 --> 01:41:51.913
Look at me.

01:41:53.230 --> 01:41:55.613
Chris, look at me!

01:41:55.614 --> 01:41:56.447
What?

01:41:56.448 --> 01:41:58.266
What else are you gonna say to me?

01:42:01.820 --> 01:42:05.003
Look, this wasn't meant to be.

01:42:05.890 --> 01:42:08.879
We weren't meant to be,

01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:11.130
but that doesn't mean
that I didn't love you.

01:42:14.245 --> 01:42:15.995
So you did love me?

01:42:18.310 --> 01:42:20.783
After all this, after
this fucking betrayal?

01:42:21.867 --> 01:42:22.700
Are you kidding me?

01:42:22.701 --> 01:42:24.069
I loved you!

01:42:24.070 --> 01:42:25.120
You know I loved you.

01:42:26.626 --> 01:42:27.726
It just wasn't enough.

01:42:30.267 --> 01:42:32.099
I gave you my fucking heart.

01:42:32.100 --> 01:42:34.436
Fuck you!

01:42:34.437 --> 01:42:36.979
You never gave me your heart!

01:42:36.980 --> 01:42:39.069
Not all of it, anyway.

01:42:39.070 --> 01:42:40.506
How could you?

01:42:40.507 --> 01:42:42.499
You love the bottle too much!

01:42:42.500 --> 01:42:43.619
You love your fuckin' pot

01:42:43.620 --> 01:42:45.623
and your lazy-ass friends too much.

01:42:45.624 --> 01:42:46.457
Yeah.

01:42:47.781 --> 01:42:48.614
Fuck.

01:42:53.314 --> 01:42:54.913
Hey, come on.

01:42:54.914 --> 01:42:55.747
Hey.

01:42:56.994 --> 01:42:57.827
Come on.

01:42:58.730 --> 01:43:01.080
Look it, I gave you
everything I possibly could.

01:43:02.010 --> 01:43:03.849
It just wasn't enough.

01:43:03.850 --> 01:43:05.829
My love was not enough.

01:43:05.830 --> 01:43:07.169
You needed more.

01:43:07.170 --> 01:43:09.623
You needed someone else.

01:43:11.420 --> 01:43:13.483
You have lost me today.

01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:19.623
The love that we had,
we'll never find again.

01:43:23.750 --> 01:43:27.253
But I lost you long before.

01:43:29.490 --> 01:43:32.320
I lost you to a lifestyle
that I could not survive!

01:43:34.970 --> 01:43:38.433
You had the choice long ago
and you could have chosen me!

01:43:40.920 --> 01:43:45.399
But you chose the bottle,
you chose the high.

01:43:45.400 --> 01:43:48.583
You chose a different feeling than love!

01:43:51.710 --> 01:43:52.543
Just leave!

01:44:00.113 --> 01:44:00.946
I am.

01:44:02.720 --> 01:44:06.093
I'd like to think that I'll
look back on our good times,

01:44:11.690 --> 01:44:12.603
but I won't,

01:44:14.167 --> 01:44:16.052
and you won't, either.

01:44:26.797 --> 01:44:28.547
You all right, bud?

01:44:31.230 --> 01:44:32.749
Hey.

01:44:32.750 --> 01:44:34.749
Listen, I know it's not
gonna heal those scars

01:44:34.750 --> 01:44:35.900
in that heart, big guy,

01:44:39.056 --> 01:44:40.606
but it's gonna soothe the pain.

01:44:42.850 --> 01:44:44.773
Just spark it up, talk about it.

01:44:46.570 --> 01:44:47.573
Relax, bud.

01:45:19.345 --> 01:45:23.178
I don't think I've
asked you where you live.

01:45:28.070 --> 01:45:28.903
Here?

01:45:29.740 --> 01:45:30.703
You live here?

01:45:34.930 --> 01:45:36.109
Where?

01:45:36.110 --> 01:45:37.583
Where's your room?

01:45:41.910 --> 01:45:43.819
This is your bed?

01:45:43.820 --> 01:45:45.543
There's no room?

01:45:47.060 --> 01:45:50.209
Dude, this is like
living in a palace for me.

01:45:50.210 --> 01:45:52.279
I was a hitchhiker.

01:45:52.280 --> 01:45:55.163
I slept on the ground outside.

01:45:56.660 --> 01:45:57.493
This,

01:45:58.680 --> 01:45:59.723
this is the life.

01:46:00.840 --> 01:46:03.609
A roof over my head, running water,

01:46:03.610 --> 01:46:06.443
and all the free drugs I want, yeah.

01:46:09.210 --> 01:46:13.773
Nice, so Chris just hooks
you up whenever you want?

01:46:15.393 --> 01:46:16.443
The drugs are mine.

01:46:17.610 --> 01:46:18.763
I'm the drug dealer.

01:46:19.610 --> 01:46:20.560
Chris works for me.

01:46:23.360 --> 01:46:24.423
Holy shit.

01:46:25.360 --> 01:46:26.623
You're the pot dealer?

01:46:27.650 --> 01:46:28.769
Well, yeah.

01:46:28.770 --> 01:46:31.699
Not just pot, I sell
pot, coke, 'shrooms, X

01:46:31.700 --> 01:46:33.509
and some Puerto Rican moonshine

01:46:33.510 --> 01:46:34.979
that Pepe down the street makes.

01:46:34.980 --> 01:46:37.723
Goes down smooth but kicks
in like a fuckin' mule.

01:46:39.870 --> 01:46:41.249
You sell that from here?

01:46:41.250 --> 01:46:42.849
Yeah, I do.

01:46:42.850 --> 01:46:44.050
See that bag over there?

01:46:45.220 --> 01:46:46.529
I've had it for years.

01:46:46.530 --> 01:46:47.863
Keep everything in there.

01:46:49.660 --> 01:46:50.493
That's it.

01:46:50.494 --> 01:46:51.669
We got these hippies.

01:46:51.670 --> 01:46:53.430
Call backup, let's fuckin' go.

01:46:54.791 --> 01:46:55.624
Come on, Frye.

01:46:55.624 --> 01:46:56.460
We need you as backup.

01:46:59.660 --> 01:47:01.819
Frye, Frye.

01:47:01.820 --> 01:47:03.320
You're gonna need that pistol.

01:47:10.930 --> 01:47:12.133
So relax, bud.

01:47:26.546 --> 01:47:30.359
We didn't get what we came here for.

01:47:30.360 --> 01:47:31.889
Oh fuck, you're right.

01:47:31.890 --> 01:47:33.693
Totally spaced, my bad, man.

01:47:34.730 --> 01:47:36.080
How much do you need again?

01:47:38.120 --> 01:47:39.870
We're gonna be needin' all of it.

01:47:43.140 --> 01:47:44.459
All of it?

01:47:44.460 --> 01:47:45.819
What?

01:47:45.820 --> 01:47:47.423
Yeah, everything you've got.

01:47:50.210 --> 01:47:51.813
You're fuckin' with me, right?

01:47:54.940 --> 01:47:56.659
Trippin' me out, bud.

01:47:56.660 --> 01:47:57.493
What's goin' on?

01:48:02.570 --> 01:48:03.839
Take me to your stash.

01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:05.853
I really don't want this to get messy.

01:48:08.210 --> 01:48:10.900
Turn around, go down the stairs

01:48:12.740 --> 01:48:14.569
and show me the drugs

01:48:14.570 --> 01:48:17.409
and then, we'll be on our way.

01:48:17.410 --> 01:48:19.340
You can even keep that joint, bud.

01:49:12.457 --> 01:49:13.763

01:50:10.135 --> 01:50:12.370
I'm just a girl goin'
through this life with

01:50:13.330 --> 01:50:14.280
a reckless abandon.

01:50:26.060 --> 01:50:26.893

01:50:26.894 --> 01:50:27.956

01:50:50.870 --> 01:50:51.703

01:50:53.753 --> 01:50:55.676
