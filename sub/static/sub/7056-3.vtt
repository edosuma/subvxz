00:01.571 --> 00:02.820
If you are watching this,

00:02.872 --> 00:03.989
then you know very well

00:04.040 --> 00:05.740
that the observers
have invaded.

00:06.274 --> 00:08.275
Previously on <i>Fringe...</i>

00:08.293 --> 00:10.495
You can't go back to Harvard.
We can't get it.

00:10.546 --> 00:12.080
It was taken over
by Observers.

00:12.114 --> 00:13.664
Well, that's not a problem.

00:13.699 --> 00:14.916
Tunnels!

00:14.950 --> 00:18.419
2 1/4 miles of tunnels
that house the steam pipes

00:18.454 --> 00:19.504
that heat Harvard.

00:19.555 --> 00:21.456
They must have
ambered it.

00:21.490 --> 00:23.875
<i>It's my</i>
<i>Betamax recorder.</i>

00:23.909 --> 00:25.610
I don't think
I wrote anything down.

00:25.644 --> 00:27.678
I think
I was making a video.

00:27.730 --> 00:30.281
This plan
will restore us

00:30.315 --> 00:32.734
and rid the world
of the Observers.

00:32.768 --> 00:35.887
<i>You must recover each tape</i>
<i>and follow the instructions</i>

00:35.921 --> 00:38.322
<i>to retrieve</i>
<i>all the parts of the plan.</i>

00:38.357 --> 00:41.192
You are
humanity's only hope.

00:49.585 --> 00:51.619
<i>Slowly.</i>

00:51.653 --> 00:54.539
Suddenly you have
all the finesse of a butcher.

00:54.590 --> 00:57.175
Walter, do you
want me to do this or not?

00:57.209 --> 01:00.094
This work requires
a surgeon's touch.

01:01.463 --> 01:04.015
I'm more than happy
to let you take over.

01:04.049 --> 01:05.433
Fine.

01:05.467 --> 01:06.717
Proceed.

01:06.769 --> 01:09.303
But it's on
your shoulders.

Advertise your product or brand here

01:22.901 --> 01:25.453
Not even warped
from the heat.

01:25.487 --> 01:27.488
Not bad for a butcher.

01:27.522 --> 01:30.875
Walter. Got some more fuel
for the van.

01:30.909 --> 01:33.861
<i>I have tape number one.</i>
Have you watched it?

01:33.879 --> 01:37.081
No. I've only just
liberated it.

01:38.533 --> 01:40.367
Shall we have a look?

01:59.738 --> 02:02.890
I had a prescription.
It was medicinal.

02:05.828 --> 02:07.728
Welcome
to tape three of my plan...

02:07.746 --> 02:10.698
What happened to tape one
and two?

02:10.732 --> 02:13.251
Walter, you stored
the tapes out of order.

02:13.285 --> 02:14.568
Shocker.

02:14.586 --> 02:17.371
<i>These videotapes</i>
<i>must be retrieved.</i>

02:17.405 --> 02:19.040
This tape will explain

02:19.074 --> 02:23.628
one of the most crucial elements
that you will need.

02:23.679 --> 02:27.465
You will need to find
your way to Pennsylvania...

02:27.516 --> 02:32.019
<i>latitude and longitude</i>
<i>coordinates 49 degrees,</i>

02:32.054 --> 02:33.888
<i>20 minutes, 2 seconds North,</i>

02:33.922 --> 02:35.973
<i>79 degrees, 12 minutes,</i>

02:36.024 --> 02:37.859
and 32 seconds West.

02:37.893 --> 02:41.445
Now, when you arrive--

02:41.480 --> 02:43.147
Really?

02:43.198 --> 02:45.432
See if you can rewind
the coordinates.

02:45.450 --> 02:50.037
Uh, 41 degrees, 20 minutes,
2 seconds North,

02:50.072 --> 02:51.605
79 degrees, 12 minutes,

02:51.623 --> 02:54.041
32 seconds West.

02:54.076 --> 02:56.494
- Are you sure?
- She's sure.

02:56.545 --> 02:58.746
Walter.

03:00.632 --> 03:02.800
Do you recognize
the location?

03:02.834 --> 03:05.136
I'm sorry.
I-if I've been there,

03:05.170 --> 03:06.804
it's been wiped
from my mind,

03:06.838 --> 03:09.140
along with the other pieces
of my plan

03:09.174 --> 03:11.342
<i>to beat the Observers.</i>

03:11.393 --> 03:13.561
Hmm.

03:13.595 --> 03:15.462
The entire area
is undeveloped.

03:15.480 --> 03:17.464
There's nothing around it
for miles.

03:17.482 --> 03:19.466
How are the roads in and out
of Pennsylvania these days?

03:19.484 --> 03:21.135
<i>Do you think we can get</i>
<i>all the way out there safely?</i>

03:21.153 --> 03:23.137
<i>We'd need to avoid</i>
<i>checkpoints.</i>

03:23.155 --> 03:24.438
I mean,
it's a long way to go,

03:24.472 --> 03:26.190
considering we don't know
what we're looking for.

03:26.241 --> 03:27.858
Or if it's still even there--

03:27.910 --> 03:29.193
<i>whatever it is.</i>

03:29.244 --> 03:31.412
Hey, Walter, you think
we might be able

03:31.446 --> 03:33.331
to jog your memory--

03:34.700 --> 03:36.584
I-I don't think
I should travel.

03:36.618 --> 03:37.952
<i>My feet are swollen</i>

03:37.986 --> 03:40.338
<i>from standing</i>
<i>in front of the Amber all day.</i>

03:40.372 --> 03:41.989
<i>I'll stay here for a bit</i>

03:42.007 --> 03:45.326
and...regroup.

03:46.661 --> 03:48.179
What?

04:10.118 --> 04:11.485
Walter, you all right?

04:11.519 --> 04:14.705
I'm fairly certain I have
a blood clot, because somebody

04:14.740 --> 04:17.358
wouldn't stop at Scranton
to let me stretch my legs.

04:17.375 --> 04:19.043
Walter, we're fugitives.

04:19.077 --> 04:21.545
We can't stop every five
minutes to keep you limber.

04:26.752 --> 04:28.336
This is it?

04:28.370 --> 04:30.554
<i>Uh, yes...</i>

04:30.589 --> 04:33.341
this is exactly where
we're supposed to be.

04:34.926 --> 04:37.728
So what were you doing out here
21 years ago?

05:06.408 --> 05:09.593
Is that what
we're out here to find?

05:11.546 --> 05:14.799
<i>I'm telling you.</i>

05:14.850 --> 05:17.802
It was a wicked tree dwarf.

05:17.853 --> 05:19.970
And I'm telling you,
it was a kid.

05:20.022 --> 05:23.090
I saw him.
He looked right at me.

05:23.108 --> 05:25.259
<i>You know, I used</i>
<i>to imagine this--</i>

05:25.277 --> 05:28.029
going on a mission with you.

05:28.063 --> 05:30.481
You have no idea how many
battles we won together.

05:30.532 --> 05:34.151
You know,
it's a lot to live up to.

05:34.202 --> 05:36.370
No, you're...

05:36.405 --> 05:38.989
even more than
I imagined.

05:56.758 --> 05:59.593
Definitely not dwarves.

The three of you...

07:43.242 --> 07:45.710
you haven't aged a day.

07:48.797 --> 07:52.083
You were supposed to be dead
a long time ago.

We were trapped in Amber
for 21 years.

08:02.645 --> 08:05.813
My name is Edwin.

08:07.316 --> 08:11.903
You were exposed

I'm supposed to retrieve
something here, Edwin,

08:26.619 --> 08:30.538
something very important.

08:30.572 --> 08:32.924
You seem to know me.

It's electromagnetic
discharge.

09:16.135 --> 09:17.919
What is this place?

09:17.953 --> 09:20.505
You're looking at history.

09:20.556 --> 09:22.974
Whose?

09:23.008 --> 09:24.809
Ours...

09:24.843 --> 09:29.230
yours, mankind's.

09:29.264 --> 09:32.400
These are data cubes.

09:32.434 --> 09:34.702
Stored on them...

09:34.737 --> 09:36.754
are accounts of every
major historical event

09:36.789 --> 09:39.140
from the day
of the invasion onward.

09:45.597 --> 09:47.165
You have files on us.

09:47.199 --> 09:49.150
Of course.
You're relevant.

09:49.168 --> 09:51.185
We gather important information
from around the world,

09:51.220 --> 09:53.021
and then we record it.

09:53.055 --> 09:55.957
You have a healthy lore
about you.

09:55.991 --> 09:57.825
<i>My son, River,</i>

09:57.843 --> 10:01.629
is something of an expert
on the Fringe Division.

10:05.718 --> 10:09.637
We were--we were refugees
from the cities.

10:09.671 --> 10:14.142
My father started
this historical record.

10:15.310 --> 10:17.445
<i>He believed our history,</i>
<i>like that</i>

10:17.479 --> 10:18.896
of all other conquered
races before us,

10:18.947 --> 10:22.283
would be rewritten
by our oppressors.

10:22.317 --> 10:26.070
Someone has to survive
to tell mankind's story.

10:27.623 --> 10:30.792
What happened
to all of you--your skin?

10:30.826 --> 10:34.295
You said we've already
been exposed.

10:34.329 --> 10:37.248
<i>We noticed it</i>
<i>after we settled.</i>

10:37.299 --> 10:40.918
Small patches at first,
and then over time, it spread.

10:40.969 --> 10:43.337
<i>It has something to do</i>
<i>with this area.</i>

10:43.371 --> 10:46.307
We thought it was
the drinking water or the soil.

10:46.341 --> 10:48.476
Why didn't you evacuate?

10:52.147 --> 10:54.599
What we do here
is important.

10:54.650 --> 10:57.852
<i>Even after we became afflicted,</i>
<i>we couldn't leave.</i>

10:57.886 --> 11:01.656
<i>It's all here, everything.</i>
<i>We can't move it.</i>

11:01.690 --> 11:02.940
We can't travel.

11:02.991 --> 11:04.358

11:04.392 --> 11:07.228
<i>we don't want to draw</i>
<i>attention.</i>

11:07.246 --> 11:11.866
We just want to be left alone
to record history.

11:11.900 --> 11:14.285
No one wants to come here...

11:14.336 --> 11:15.920
<i>which is perfect for us.</i>

<i>should leave,</i>

<i>unless you want to look</i>
<i>like us.</i>

11:25.547 --> 11:27.181
We can't.

11:27.216 --> 11:30.518
There was a plan
to defeat the invaders.

11:30.552 --> 11:31.719
I mean, there is...

11:31.753 --> 11:34.605
a plan to defeat
the invaders.

11:34.640 --> 11:37.642
And I believe
it will be successful.

11:40.229 --> 11:42.930
But I don't remember it.

11:42.948 --> 11:46.934
But I know that I am supposed
to get something from here.

11:46.952 --> 11:49.704
I've been here before.
I must have.

11:49.738 --> 11:52.406
Search...

11:52.441 --> 11:55.426
Bishop, Walter.

11:58.464 --> 12:00.765
<i>If you've ever set foot</i>
<i>in this camp before,</i>

12:00.799 --> 12:03.551
<i>it would be documented.</i>

12:06.255 --> 12:07.955
<i>Hi.</i>

12:09.975 --> 12:11.292
Hi.

12:13.128 --> 12:14.595
What's your name?

12:14.629 --> 12:17.098
River.

12:21.803 --> 12:24.689
Wow. Where did these
come from?

12:24.740 --> 12:27.074
I made them.

12:27.109 --> 12:29.527
Can you sign them?

12:33.582 --> 12:35.283
These are really good.

12:36.785 --> 12:39.120
<i>You fought them</i>
<i>when they came.</i>

12:39.154 --> 12:41.789
<i>You didn't hide</i>
<i>like we did.</i>

12:41.823 --> 12:44.158
You're heroes.

12:44.176 --> 12:47.295
I have a lot
of different editions

12:47.329 --> 12:49.514
from stories I've heard.

12:49.548 --> 12:51.465
A lot of them
I even made up.

12:51.499 --> 12:53.935
<i>I wish I was around</i>
<i>during your time,</i>

12:53.969 --> 12:56.053

real heroes.

12:56.104 --> 12:58.773
<i>Well, kiddo,</i>
<i>you're my hero</i>

12:58.807 --> 13:01.008

a nice, strong jawline.

13:10.202 --> 13:12.370
And 32 seconds West.

13:12.404 --> 13:16.523
Now, when you arrive
at the designated place,

13:16.542 --> 13:20.411
you will need to locate--

13:23.582 --> 13:26.751
When you arrive
at the designated place,

13:26.802 --> 13:30.504
you will need to locate--

13:43.785 --> 13:47.772
...Place, you will need to locate...

13:47.806 --> 13:49.607
a mine.

13:51.827 --> 13:52.877
...to locate

13:52.911 --> 13:54.579
a mine.

13:56.731 --> 13:59.400
Locate a mine.

14:10.078 --> 14:11.429
Hello?

14:11.463 --> 14:14.181
Olivia, I need to speak to Walter.
<i>Sure.</i>

14:14.216 --> 14:15.683
Walter.

14:15.717 --> 14:17.418
It's Astrid.

14:17.436 --> 14:19.186
Yes, what is it?

14:19.221 --> 14:21.105
<i>Did you find anything</i>
<i>in the archive?</i>

14:21.139 --> 14:23.641
Nothing. There's absolutely
no record

14:23.692 --> 14:25.276
<i>of me being here whatsoever.</i>

14:25.310 --> 14:26.811
Okay, well,
I found something.

14:26.862 --> 14:29.313
<i>Walter, is there a mine</i>
<i>where you are?</i>

14:29.364 --> 14:31.449
Mime. The only mime
that I know of

14:31.483 --> 14:32.766
is Marcel Marceau.

14:32.784 --> 14:34.235
<i>What's he got to do</i>
<i>with any of this?</i>

14:34.269 --> 14:35.602
No. A mine.

14:35.621 --> 14:38.990
You said mine--m-i-n-e--
on the tape.

14:39.041 --> 14:41.792
Walter, whatever you're supposed
to find, it's in a mine.

14:41.827 --> 14:45.730
Do you have a mine--
m-i-n-e--here?

14:45.764 --> 14:46.714
Yes.

14:46.748 --> 14:48.749
<i>It was a gold mine.</i>

15:05.651 --> 15:09.070
These men
have something to report.

15:19.498 --> 15:21.232
Where?

15:21.266 --> 15:23.067
Rural Pennsylvania.

15:43.683 --> 15:47.152
In 1923,
a mine collapsed in Peru.

15:47.187 --> 15:49.688
The trapped survivors were
forced to nourish themselves

15:49.722 --> 15:51.273
on the dead.

15:51.324 --> 15:52.774
Thanks for that, Walter.

15:52.826 --> 15:55.060
Oh, but I'm sure that
won't be the case here.

15:56.663 --> 15:58.563
Finding gold
in an abandoned gold mine's

15:58.581 --> 16:00.232
not gonna be easy.

16:00.250 --> 16:01.867
<i>We don't know that it's gold.</i>

16:01.901 --> 16:04.369
<i>Whatever it is,</i>
<i>it's in here.</i>

16:04.403 --> 16:06.455
<i>I'll climb down.</i>

16:10.960 --> 16:13.378
<i>Is that secure?</i>

16:13.412 --> 16:16.515
There's something
on the other end of this rope.

16:16.549 --> 16:19.268
Can you give me a hand?
Yep.

16:20.687 --> 16:22.471
<i>People have been coming</i>
<i>in and out of this mine</i>

16:22.522 --> 16:23.772
<i>for 21 years.</i>

16:23.806 --> 16:26.308
<i>I doubt it's just</i>
<i>gonna be waiting for us.</i>

16:26.359 --> 16:28.477
<i>Nothing is that easy.</i>

16:29.929 --> 16:31.897
Whoa--oh, oh.

16:31.931 --> 16:34.099
It snagged on something.

16:49.382 --> 16:52.251
Looks like he was trying
to climb back up.

16:55.121 --> 16:57.806
Same bark-like growth
as on the people here.

16:57.840 --> 16:59.007
But worse.

16:59.058 --> 17:00.893
<i>I'd assumed what was</i>
<i>afflicting these people</i>

17:00.927 --> 17:03.345
was some sort of fungus,
but I was wrong.

17:03.396 --> 17:07.632
These tissues
show signs of calcification.

17:07.650 --> 17:09.685
<i>Perhaps whatever</i>
<i>was causing</i>

17:09.736 --> 17:12.104
the condition of the people
in the camp

17:12.137 --> 17:14.388
is emanating
from this mine.

17:14.424 --> 17:17.342
And the closer
one gets to the source,

17:17.377 --> 17:20.494
the more intense
the reaction is.

17:20.530 --> 17:21.997
<i>No one can survive</i>
<i>down there.</i>

17:22.031 --> 17:24.648
<i>Until I've conducted</i>
<i>an analysis,</i>

17:24.666 --> 17:28.987
<i>we have to turn back.</i>

17:33.543 --> 17:36.211
This is Anil.
<i>I have something for you.</i>

17:36.262 --> 17:37.930
Something important.

17:37.964 --> 17:41.633
<i>Etta and her team</i>
<i>have been located.</i>

17:43.002 --> 17:44.770
Thank you.

17:44.804 --> 17:47.339
Is anybody else starving?

17:48.274 --> 17:50.058
Here.

17:54.113 --> 17:56.231
- What's that?
- It's an apple.

17:56.282 --> 17:58.683
No, thank you.

17:58.701 --> 18:00.619
Yum, yum.

18:04.624 --> 18:07.192
Do you remember that amazing
apple pie we had

18:07.210 --> 18:09.461
just after the invasion?

18:09.495 --> 18:10.879
We were in Boston.

18:10.913 --> 18:11.997
<i>Someone had told us</i>

18:12.031 --> 18:14.967
<i>about the shelter</i>
<i>for lost children.</i>

18:15.001 --> 18:16.701
We were looking
for a place to eat

18:16.719 --> 18:19.137
when we found
that dingy little restaurant

18:19.172 --> 18:22.307
with a cook
who was a mad genius.

18:22.342 --> 18:24.709
What was that guy's name?

18:24.727 --> 18:26.595
I don't know.

18:27.880 --> 18:30.882
You don't remember?

18:30.900 --> 18:32.651
Nope.

18:33.903 --> 18:37.389
Well, that's a first.

18:37.407 --> 18:39.224
<i>I can't believe I don't</i>
<i>remember the guy's name.</i>

18:39.242 --> 18:40.892
<i>It was the name</i>
<i>of the restaurant.</i>

18:40.910 --> 18:42.861
It started with a "D."
It was like...Dante's

18:42.895 --> 18:44.997
or Dominic's
or something like that.

18:45.031 --> 18:46.498
You really don't remember?

18:46.532 --> 18:48.500
No. I really don't
remember.

18:52.121 --> 18:54.673
<i>Air sample is ready.</i>

19:01.714 --> 19:03.715
I think I know
what happened here.

19:08.087 --> 19:09.971
<i>This man died</i>
<i>of asphyxiation.</i>

19:10.023 --> 19:13.525
Every pore on his body
is completely sealed.

19:13.559 --> 19:15.477
His body was trying
to protect itself

19:15.528 --> 19:18.063
against
the airborne corrosive.

19:18.097 --> 19:20.866
Somehow, its pH
has been radically altered.

19:20.900 --> 19:23.035
<i>And apparently,</i>

19:23.069 --> 19:25.203
it gets much worse the deeper
one goes into the mine.

19:25.238 --> 19:28.407
<i>Could whatever we're looking</i>
<i>for have caused this?</i>

19:28.441 --> 19:30.042
Quite unlikely.
If I had to theorize,

19:30.076 --> 19:31.543
it's high levels of CO2

19:31.577 --> 19:33.912
and other gases introduced
into the atmosphere by the Observers.

19:33.946 --> 19:36.381
From those machines
that they were building

19:36.416 --> 19:38.050
<i>in Central Park.</i>

19:38.084 --> 19:41.586
Well, how would that affect
Edwin and his people?

19:41.620 --> 19:43.755
Well, they're far enough
away from the source,

19:43.789 --> 19:45.640
receiving only
incremental doses.

19:45.675 --> 19:48.126
However, prolonged exposure

19:48.144 --> 19:52.180
<i>has created</i>
<i>a drastic immune response.</i>

19:52.231 --> 19:56.768
Well, imagine an extreme
form of psoriasis.

19:56.802 --> 20:01.239
But not as extreme as our
unfortunate mine friend here.

20:03.359 --> 20:04.743
<i>Dr. Bishop,</i>

20:04.777 --> 20:07.696
I found an entry
I think you'll want to see.

20:07.730 --> 20:09.865
Five weeks after the invasion,
a man came here

20:09.899 --> 20:11.500
and went down into the mine

20:11.534 --> 20:13.318
and gathered several rocks,
it says here,

20:13.336 --> 20:14.536
with a reddish hue.

20:14.587 --> 20:17.472
Was this man called
September?

20:17.507 --> 20:19.991
No. My father has it recorded
as a man,

20:20.026 --> 20:22.327
late 30s, dark hair.

20:22.345 --> 20:24.829
His name was Donald.

20:24.847 --> 20:28.133
<i>He says he was waiting</i>
<i>for a scientist from Boston.</i>

20:28.167 --> 20:29.751
I was thinking
perhaps that was you.

20:29.786 --> 20:31.269
I don't know any Donald.

20:31.304 --> 20:33.221
Well, maybe you just
don't remember.

20:33.256 --> 20:35.440
If he was part
of the plan that you lost,

20:35.475 --> 20:36.975
then it stands to reason--

20:37.009 --> 20:38.977
No, no, no.
I-I don't understand.

20:39.011 --> 20:40.896
Why would you record this?

20:40.947 --> 20:43.615
A man collecting rocks--
why is it important?

20:43.649 --> 20:46.818
It was recorded because
of what happened to him.

20:49.372 --> 20:53.241
He was taken away against
his will by two invaders.

20:53.292 --> 20:55.911
So they weren't happy
that he'd taken those rocks.

20:55.962 --> 20:58.914
Why the hell
would I want rocks?

21:03.302 --> 21:05.253
Your hand, Walter.

21:07.190 --> 21:08.706
It's on your skin.

21:09.892 --> 21:12.677
Show me your hand.

21:15.398 --> 21:16.848
My God.

21:16.882 --> 21:18.433
Yours too.

21:38.026 --> 21:39.027
We're lucky.

21:39.028 --> 21:41.196
It hasn't rooted
into the dermis yet.

21:41.230 --> 21:43.514
But I'm afraid
that won't last.

21:44.867 --> 21:48.486
Okay, well, how long
until it isn't removable?

21:48.520 --> 21:50.405
Until it isn't.

21:51.540 --> 21:53.541
<i>- Dr. Bishop.</i>
<i>-  Oh!</i>

21:53.576 --> 21:55.627
Good, good, good.
Excellent, excellent.

21:55.661 --> 21:58.363
Over here.
Thank you very much.

21:58.381 --> 22:00.081
<i>I am going to build</i>
<i>a suit</i>

22:00.132 --> 22:03.919
that will allow us
to go into the mine.

22:05.071 --> 22:06.521
According to the arm,
we would need skin

22:06.572 --> 22:09.107
300 layers thicker than
a rhinoceros to enter the mine,

22:09.141 --> 22:12.527
so I'm trying to ascertain
a metal or an alloy

22:12.578 --> 22:14.646
that we can use
for the suit's lining.

22:14.664 --> 22:15.980
And in the meantime,

22:15.998 --> 22:18.149
I need you
to go back to the van

22:18.167 --> 22:20.001
because I need
the weather stripping.

22:20.036 --> 22:21.286
Sure.

22:25.508 --> 22:26.875
Hey, Anil.

22:26.926 --> 22:29.177
I got a call
from one of our operatives.

22:29.211 --> 22:31.429
<i>The Loyalists</i>
<i>are tracking you.</i>

22:31.464 --> 22:33.882
You've got to move.

22:38.804 --> 22:41.556
Did I upset you?

22:42.942 --> 22:44.842
Earlier when I was talking
about the restaurant,

22:44.860 --> 22:47.595
it seemed like
you were upset.

22:47.630 --> 22:50.465
I know
you don't forget names.

22:50.516 --> 22:52.434
Donovan's.

22:54.103 --> 22:56.688
That was the name
of the restaurant.

22:56.722 --> 23:00.976
<i>It's not that</i>
<i>I can't remember.</i>

23:01.027 --> 23:03.728
It's that I can't forget.

23:05.865 --> 23:08.566
Do you remember when we
couldn't find her that day,

23:08.600 --> 23:11.703
you drew a plan
on a napkin?

23:11.721 --> 23:13.421
Yeah. Of course I do.

23:16.676 --> 23:19.311
You were talking
about going up to Maine

23:19.345 --> 23:22.814
to this refugee camp
that you'd heard about.

23:22.848 --> 23:24.816
And I was looking at you
and nodding,

23:24.850 --> 23:28.520
and in my head I was thinking,
"I can't go."

23:33.192 --> 23:34.743
Behind you--
you couldn't see it--

23:34.777 --> 23:38.730
but there was a wall
of missing-person flyers.

23:40.399 --> 23:43.168
You know, with every day,

23:43.202 --> 23:45.170
the odds of finding
our little girl

23:45.204 --> 23:47.756
the way we wanted to find her
were getting worse,

23:47.790 --> 23:50.175
<i>and we didn't talk about it.</i>

23:50.209 --> 23:52.794
<i>I mean, I...</i>

23:52.845 --> 23:56.914
I couldn't put it
into words then, but...

23:56.932 --> 24:00.084
I felt responsible.

24:00.102 --> 24:02.354
Responsible how?

24:07.810 --> 24:11.763
I wanted so much
to be a mother, but...

24:11.781 --> 24:13.698
I just...

24:13.733 --> 24:16.434
didn't think that
I was programmed that way.

24:16.452 --> 24:20.955
That I was...
destined for something else.

24:20.990 --> 24:22.290
Ever since I was a kid,

24:22.324 --> 24:24.075
ever since
the Cortexiphan trials,

24:24.109 --> 24:26.578
<i>I just...</i>

24:26.612 --> 24:28.780
I was at odds.

24:28.798 --> 24:33.084
So how could I have
this incredible little girl?

24:40.810 --> 24:42.644
So, when we lost her,

24:42.678 --> 24:46.631
I felt like
that was my punishment...

24:46.649 --> 24:50.185
my punishment
for being too conflicted

24:50.236 --> 24:54.189
to appreciate her
when we had her.

25:00.162 --> 25:04.582
And that day
at the restaurant...

25:04.617 --> 25:07.652
I knew that I had
to go back to New York

25:07.670 --> 25:10.839
because I didn't want to...

25:12.792 --> 25:15.176
find...

25:16.962 --> 25:19.931
what I knew
we were going to find.

25:25.187 --> 25:26.671
I just...

25:26.689 --> 25:28.606
I just believed
so strongly that she was dead,

25:28.641 --> 25:30.892
and I didn't want to see it.

25:30.943 --> 25:32.944
And you thought I went back
because of my strength,

25:32.978 --> 25:35.280
and she said
that she admired me today.

25:38.984 --> 25:40.151
Olivia.

25:43.639 --> 25:47.575
I saw how you were
with our little girl.

25:47.626 --> 25:51.129
I know how much
you love her.

25:51.163 --> 25:53.965
And I'm not telling you
to forget it, but...

25:53.999 --> 25:56.200
the past is the past.

25:56.218 --> 25:59.754
Don't let it get
in the way of this.

25:59.805 --> 26:02.006
I don't know why
it's happening,

26:02.040 --> 26:05.143
but our family
got a second chance.

26:08.380 --> 26:12.066
So I'm gonna take it.

26:12.101 --> 26:14.051
<i>Hey, guys.</i>

26:14.069 --> 26:16.554
We have a problem.

26:16.572 --> 26:19.557
The Observers
are tracking us.

26:26.248 --> 26:28.750
Hand me the sealer.

26:30.903 --> 26:34.622
Walter, how long until
the suit is finished?

26:34.673 --> 26:37.742
I'm going as fast
as I can. Why?

26:37.760 --> 26:39.794
The Observers know
that we're in the area.

26:39.845 --> 26:42.130
They saw us on the highway
when we stopped.

26:42.181 --> 26:44.933
<i>Near Route 11.</i>
You need to leave.

26:44.967 --> 26:46.935
I need one more material--
copper.

26:46.969 --> 26:48.937
There's only three roads
you could have taken after--

26:48.971 --> 26:51.756
Jonathan here says there's
an encampment down the mountain

26:51.774 --> 26:53.191
which trades metals.
No.

26:53.225 --> 26:55.143
<i>You're not listening.</i>

26:55.194 --> 26:57.729
We have until morning, at best,
before they find us.

26:57.763 --> 26:59.147
They'll destroy everything.

26:59.198 --> 27:01.032
All of our work will be lost.
You need to go now.

27:01.066 --> 27:03.267
No, no, if we can just
get down to the camp--

27:03.285 --> 27:05.036
Forget that camp.
Those men are dangerous,

27:05.070 --> 27:06.771
and they won't trade
with anyone they don't know.

27:06.789 --> 27:09.707
You know them. You've talked
to them on your radio.

27:09.742 --> 27:11.492
You have contacts
in that camp?

27:11.544 --> 27:13.778
I've communicated with them
on my radio.

27:13.796 --> 27:15.446
But only when it suits them.

27:15.464 --> 27:17.298
They don't even know who I am.

27:17.333 --> 27:18.883
And they certainly
don't want people

27:18.918 --> 27:20.618
going into their quadrant--
that much I do know.

27:20.636 --> 27:23.120
The way I see it,
you're our only chance.

27:23.138 --> 27:24.839
They don't know us.

27:24.890 --> 27:26.474
Look, I'm armed.
I'll go with you.

27:26.508 --> 27:27.976
<i>We can barter together.</i>
Barter with what?

27:28.010 --> 27:29.394
What do you have
to offer them?

27:29.428 --> 27:31.229
I've got some antibiotics,
medicine.

27:31.263 --> 27:34.399
Go back to Boston,
make the suit there,

27:34.433 --> 27:36.517
and then come back
when it's safe.

27:36.569 --> 27:38.486
The baldies took away
this Donald person

27:38.520 --> 27:40.188
<i>when he went into that mine</i>
<i>to get the rocks.</i>

27:40.239 --> 27:42.690
<i>If they read you</i>
<i>and find out</i>

27:42.741 --> 27:44.192
that we're looking
for the same thing,

27:44.243 --> 27:45.860
<i>they'll seal it</i>
<i>permanently.</i>

27:45.911 --> 27:47.412
You don't even know
what the rocks are for.

27:47.446 --> 27:51.148
<i>You're putting</i>
<i>all of us at risk.</i>

28:25.634 --> 28:29.954
I want to help you.
I do, but...

28:33.008 --> 28:35.893
What happens
if I don't come back?

28:35.927 --> 28:38.946
You may be used to facing
death all the time,

28:38.981 --> 28:41.766
but I'm not.

28:41.784 --> 28:44.485
These are bad people.

28:44.536 --> 28:47.472
We may never make it back
from their camp.

28:49.258 --> 28:52.060
I have a lot to lose,
you know.

28:52.094 --> 28:54.629
I know you do.

28:56.115 --> 29:00.168
But the rocks in that mine
are important.

29:00.219 --> 29:02.420
And it's true--
we don't know what they do.

29:02.454 --> 29:04.622
But Walter
will figure it out.

29:04.657 --> 29:06.257
And when he does,

29:06.291 --> 29:09.093
we're one step closer
to defeating the invaders.

29:20.322 --> 29:22.640
I'm not afraid to die.

29:25.194 --> 29:29.297
I just don't know how to say
good-bye to my son.

29:39.375 --> 29:42.377
All right.

29:42.428 --> 29:44.662
What do you need me to do?

29:44.680 --> 29:47.215
Get on your radio.

29:47.266 --> 29:49.717
Tell them we're coming.

29:56.892 --> 29:59.844
Break, break, break.
Kilo-Alpha 42.

29:59.862 --> 30:01.679
Come in.

30:01.697 --> 30:03.898
Looking to barter.
Over.

30:06.068 --> 30:09.320
Kilo-Alpha 42.
Is anyone out there? Over.

30:09.354 --> 30:11.038
<i>This is Kilo-Alpha.</i>

30:11.073 --> 30:13.624
<i>What's your business?</i>

30:13.659 --> 30:15.376
I need copper.

30:15.411 --> 30:16.878
<i>We don't have copper.</i>

30:16.912 --> 30:19.747
Let me speak to Ivan.

30:42.488 --> 30:44.355
Tire tread.

30:44.389 --> 30:48.242
Matches the make and model
of the van they were in.

30:48.277 --> 30:49.994
Where does this road
lead?

30:50.028 --> 30:53.063
<i>Higher into</i>
<i>the mountains.</i>

31:25.178 --> 31:27.680
River?

31:37.079 --> 31:39.614
Look at me, son.

31:45.504 --> 31:48.589
What you saw back there
in that tent...

31:51.510 --> 31:55.680
there's a lot more
to the word coward

31:55.714 --> 31:59.583
and the word hero
than you think.

31:59.601 --> 32:01.852
It's complicated.

32:01.887 --> 32:04.939
You're not a coward
if you're frightened.

32:04.973 --> 32:09.026
That's not what it means.

32:09.061 --> 32:11.062
You're a coward

32:11.096 --> 32:13.564
if you know
what needs to be done

32:13.598 --> 32:15.866
and you don't do it.

32:15.901 --> 32:18.019
I was telling
that man out there

32:18.053 --> 32:21.088
that I have a lot to lose--

32:21.123 --> 32:22.990
our work,

32:23.041 --> 32:26.327
the life we have here...

32:26.378 --> 32:29.163
you.

32:29.214 --> 32:30.631
I told him
I love you so much,

32:30.666 --> 32:34.135
I wouldn't know
how to say good-bye.

32:38.290 --> 32:40.474
When your mother got sick,

32:40.509 --> 32:46.397
I promised her
I'd protect you no matter what.

32:46.431 --> 32:48.933
But I'm conflicted.

32:51.269 --> 32:54.138
There's a time
for recording history,

32:54.156 --> 32:57.324
and there's a time
for making it.

32:57.359 --> 33:00.161
We don't get a lot
of opportunities up here

33:00.195 --> 33:02.830
to make it.

33:04.750 --> 33:07.284
I've decided
to help them...

33:07.318 --> 33:10.037
to do my part.

33:12.541 --> 33:14.175
I don't want to lose you.

33:14.209 --> 33:17.678
I don't want to
lose you either.

33:17.713 --> 33:19.180
But protecting you...

33:19.214 --> 33:21.465
means making sure
there's a world out there

33:21.499 --> 33:24.185
that you can thrive in.

33:28.390 --> 33:30.391
I love you so much.

33:32.728 --> 33:35.563
It's okay, Dad.

33:35.614 --> 33:37.347
I understand.

33:37.365 --> 33:41.518
No. You don't.

33:41.536 --> 33:44.688
But you will one day...

33:44.706 --> 33:47.491
when you have children
of your own.

33:58.470 --> 34:00.304
The mineral
you are looking for

34:00.338 --> 34:02.757
is a crystallized
form of quartz

34:02.808 --> 34:05.876
that contains
in perfect proportion...

34:07.596 --> 34:09.647
They will unlock its potential

34:09.681 --> 34:13.016
and create a powerful
energy source.

34:13.051 --> 34:16.853
I will explicitly outline
these refining methods

34:16.888 --> 34:19.739
in tape six...

34:22.726 --> 34:24.911
or seven.

34:24.946 --> 34:26.580
Without this energy source,

34:26.614 --> 34:29.233
we will not be able
to implement

34:29.251 --> 34:32.402
the final phase
of our plan.

34:32.420 --> 34:34.672
To my best calculations,

34:34.706 --> 34:38.958
we will need at least
18 kilograms of the crystals.

34:39.010 --> 34:43.764
That is about 40 pounds
in imperial measures.

34:45.300 --> 34:46.467
Did you get all that?

34:46.518 --> 34:48.302
Yeah.
Thanks, Astrid.

34:48.353 --> 34:51.021
Hopefully the suit
will be strong enough

34:51.056 --> 34:53.306
to bring up 40 pounds?

34:53.358 --> 34:54.925
Hey, you contact the camp?

34:54.943 --> 34:57.928
Yes. They found copper,
and they're willing to trade.

34:57.946 --> 34:58.946
How much copper?

34:58.980 --> 35:00.147
2 kilos.

35:00.198 --> 35:02.650
That's plenty!
Too much, even!

35:02.701 --> 35:03.818
Okay. Let's go.

35:06.104 --> 35:08.489
<i>I can't.</i>

35:15.664 --> 35:19.300
You're looking for Ivan.

35:21.136 --> 35:25.306
You can give him these
for the copper.

35:25.340 --> 35:28.142
They're schematics
for our solar technology.

35:29.144 --> 35:30.928
<i>I'm not coming with you.</i>

35:30.962 --> 35:33.130
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

35:36.467 --> 35:40.654
<i>They'll trade for those.</i>
<i>They're valuable.</i>

35:40.689 --> 35:44.275
This'll get you
to the camp.

35:44.309 --> 35:46.076
Good luck.

35:48.864 --> 35:50.147
Don't worry about it.

35:50.165 --> 35:53.000
We'll be back soon.

35:54.202 --> 35:56.754
Wait!

35:58.623 --> 36:00.591
Be careful.

36:19.227 --> 36:20.311
I don't understand.

36:20.345 --> 36:22.112
This is exactly where
he told us to go.

36:22.147 --> 36:24.281
He said he knew
where their camp was.

36:24.316 --> 36:27.517
Well, why would he
send us here?

36:31.122 --> 36:34.742
Maybe he never wanted us
to find the camp.

36:51.042 --> 36:53.344
Edwin?

37:05.490 --> 37:07.992
What was that?

37:08.026 --> 37:10.529
It's the mine.

37:22.194 --> 37:25.647
There was no copper.

37:25.681 --> 37:29.701
When he called their camp,
they didn't have copper.

37:29.735 --> 37:33.454
<i>It was the only way</i>
<i>to get what you need.</i>

38:07.940 --> 38:11.909
<i>You got what you came for.</i>
<i>Now leave...</i>

38:11.944 --> 38:14.295
before the invaders
find you here.

39:17.576 --> 39:20.695
A hero died today,

39:20.729 --> 39:24.799
sacrificing himself
in order to get the Fringe team

39:24.833 --> 39:29.570
resources they need
to save our world.

39:36.361 --> 39:38.329
Edwin Massey,

39:38.363 --> 39:40.481
the recorder of history,

39:40.516 --> 39:43.251
made history.

40:06.174 --> 40:08.142
Where did you get
this vehicle?

40:08.176 --> 40:10.194
I found it on the side
of the road.

40:10.229 --> 40:12.363
The keys were in
the ignition.

40:12.397 --> 40:14.682
I didn't steal it!

40:17.018 --> 40:19.454
He will be greatly missed.

40:23.876 --> 40:26.210
Like other great men
before him,

40:26.245 --> 40:29.130
he gave his life selflessly

40:29.164 --> 40:32.467
in pursuit of freedom...

40:35.087 --> 40:38.639
and a better future.

40:58.243 --> 41:00.111
Ahh...

41:00.162 --> 41:04.165
Now, this is a ride.
