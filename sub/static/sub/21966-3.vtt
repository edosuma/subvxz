00:01.041 --> 00:03.125
(  upbeat theme playing  )

00:09.041 --> 00:12.583
Okay, explain to me again.

00:09.041 --> 00:12.583
This is football?

00:12.625 --> 00:14.458
No actual feet

00:12.625 --> 00:14.458
are involved.

00:14.500 --> 00:16.542
The object of this game

00:14.500 --> 00:16.542
is to place the sphere

00:16.583 --> 00:18.917
through the hoop,

00:16.583 --> 00:18.917
hence the name hoopball.

00:18.959 --> 00:20.792
How long have you guys

00:18.959 --> 00:20.792
been on Earth now?

00:20.834 --> 00:22.458
It's basketball.

00:22.500 --> 00:24.125
Tomorrow's

00:22.500 --> 00:24.125
the big charity game.

00:24.166 --> 00:26.834
Teachers vs. rescue workers.

00:24.166 --> 00:26.834
Do we get to play?

00:26.875 --> 00:29.041
Looks like Kade's

00:26.875 --> 00:29.041
not letting anybody play.

00:29.083 --> 00:31.792
Kade! I'm open!

00:29.083 --> 00:31.792
Over here!

00:31.834 --> 00:33.125
Pass it, son.

00:33.166 --> 00:35.542
Here he comes, and...

00:33.166 --> 00:35.542
Yes!

00:35.583 --> 00:39.583
Owning the dribble drive, and

00:35.583 --> 00:39.583
the crowd goes wild.

00:39.625 --> 00:43.041
You're supposed to go wild now.

00:39.625 --> 00:43.041
Kade, this was a 3-2 drill.

00:43.083 --> 00:44.834
You're supposed to pass

00:43.083 --> 00:44.834
to Cody.

00:44.875 --> 00:46.959
But I had the shot.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.458
No offense, Code,

00:47.000 --> 00:49.458
but in the offense department,

00:49.500 --> 00:52.625
you come up a little short.

00:49.500 --> 00:52.625
Kade, that's just mean.

00:52.667 --> 00:55.000
You're not the only person

00:52.667 --> 00:55.000
on the team, son.

00:55.041 --> 00:57.917
I know. Too bad, right?

00:55.041 --> 00:57.917
If I was,

00:57.959 --> 01:00.041
we'd win the tournament

00:57.959 --> 01:00.041
tomorrow for sure.

01:00.083 --> 01:03.041
It's not a tournament,

01:00.083 --> 01:03.041
it's a charity game.

01:03.083 --> 01:04.458
And the whole point

01:03.083 --> 01:04.458
is for my students

01:04.500 --> 01:06.166
to learn about teamwork.

01:06.208 --> 01:09.041
I'm not sure you're

01:06.208 --> 01:09.041
the best teacher for that.

01:09.083 --> 01:12.291
Maybe this game isn't

01:09.083 --> 01:12.291
such a good idea after all.

01:12.333 --> 01:14.792
Sorry, everybody.

01:14.834 --> 01:16.417
Hayley! Wait a second!

01:16.458 --> 01:19.166
That's right, keep talking. I

01:16.458 --> 01:19.166
think she likes you.

01:19.208 --> 01:21.667
Hey, I am who I am,

01:19.208 --> 01:21.667
all right?

01:21.709 --> 01:23.750
If she's not

01:21.709 --> 01:23.750
okay with it, fine.

01:23.792 --> 01:27.458
Are you sure

01:23.792 --> 01:27.458
he's related to us?

01:27.500 --> 01:29.208
Where is everyone going?

01:29.250 --> 01:30.959
Aren't we going

01:29.250 --> 01:30.959
to practice some more?

01:31.000 --> 01:34.125
You're a one-man team, remember?

01:31.000 --> 01:34.125
Practice by yourself.

01:34.166 --> 01:36.125
( phone ringtone plays )

01:36.166 --> 01:39.500
Griffin Rock Emergency.

01:36.166 --> 01:39.500
Hi, Mrs. Neederlander.

01:39.542 --> 01:41.500
Hang on...

01:41.542 --> 01:43.750
Oh, boy.

01:41.542 --> 01:43.750
Ohh...

01:43.792 --> 01:46.375
Ma'am, we had

01:43.792 --> 01:46.375
an agreement, remember?

01:46.417 --> 01:47.709
You promised not to call

01:47.750 --> 01:51.250
every time Mr. Pettypaws

01:47.750 --> 01:51.250
goes up a tree.

01:51.291 --> 01:52.834
Something bigger?

01:52.875 --> 01:55.083
All right.

01:52.875 --> 01:55.083
We'll be right there.

01:55.125 --> 01:56.375
( sighs )

01:56.417 --> 01:58.959
Rescue Bots,

01:56.417 --> 01:58.959
roll to the rescue.

02:00.959 --> 02:02.166
What on earth?

02:02.208 --> 02:03.959
I wouldn't say it's bigger,

02:04.000 --> 02:06.166
but it's definitely more.

Do not be afraid,

02:52.542 --> 02:54.875
little fella.

02:57.709 --> 03:02.709
Here, kitty, kitty,

02:57.709 --> 03:02.709
kitty, kitty...

03:02.750 --> 03:04.000
( Cody panting )

03:04.041 --> 03:05.458
CODY:

03:04.041 --> 03:05.458
Where did they all

03:04.041 --> 03:05.458
come from?

03:05.500 --> 03:07.959
How should I know?

03:05.500 --> 03:07.959
They just showed up.

03:08.041 --> 03:10.500
( engine revs )

03:10.542 --> 03:12.041
I suspected this might be

03:12.083 --> 03:14.542
where these frisky felines

03:12.083 --> 03:14.542
escaped to.

03:14.583 --> 03:17.041
( sighs ):

03:14.583 --> 03:17.041
And I suspected

03:14.583 --> 03:17.041
you might have

03:17.083 --> 03:19.166
something to do with

03:17.083 --> 03:19.166
these kitty clones, Doc.

03:19.208 --> 03:20.750
Not clones. Actually,

03:20.792 --> 03:23.125
they're products

03:20.792 --> 03:23.125
of the imaging chamber.

03:23.166 --> 03:25.125
Nothing but energy

03:23.166 --> 03:25.125
and crystals.

03:25.166 --> 03:26.625
Solid holograms,

03:25.166 --> 03:26.625
if you will.

03:26.667 --> 03:27.875
( hisses )

03:27.917 --> 03:30.125
Owie.

03:27.917 --> 03:30.125
Their claws are real enough.

03:30.166 --> 03:31.458
And they make me...

03:31.500 --> 03:33.792
( sneezes )

03:33.834 --> 03:35.375
...just like

03:33.834 --> 03:35.375
the genuine article.

03:35.417 --> 03:38.875
Normally, the chamber

03:35.417 --> 03:38.875
only manifests dreams.

03:38.917 --> 03:40.875
But when I boosted the power

03:38.917 --> 03:40.875
on the device,

03:40.917 --> 03:43.333
it picked up

03:40.917 --> 03:43.333
my waking thoughts as well.

03:43.375 --> 03:46.291
For some reason, Mr. Pettypaws

03:43.375 --> 03:46.291
popped into my head,

03:46.333 --> 03:48.709
and the next thing I knew...

03:46.333 --> 03:48.709
copy cats.

03:48.750 --> 03:51.417
But how can they survive

03:48.750 --> 03:51.417
outside the chamber?

03:51.458 --> 03:53.333
Don't they need

03:51.458 --> 03:53.333
an energy source?

03:53.375 --> 03:54.667
Precisely.

03:54.709 --> 03:56.583
To continue the experiment,

03:56.625 --> 03:59.333
I equipped each of them

03:56.625 --> 03:59.333
with an energy collar.

03:59.375 --> 04:01.208
And they've stayed charged

03:59.375 --> 04:01.208
all this time?

04:01.250 --> 04:03.458
Long enough to escape my lab

04:03.500 --> 04:06.834
and head straight for

04:03.500 --> 04:06.834
Mr. Pettypaws' favorite tree.

04:06.875 --> 04:09.458
Which means all these copies

04:09.500 --> 04:13.125
have the same memories

04:09.500 --> 04:13.125
and instincts as the original.

04:13.166 --> 04:14.542
Fascinating.

04:14.583 --> 04:16.041
Enough blather.

04:16.083 --> 04:18.667
My real precious

04:16.083 --> 04:18.667
won't come out

04:18.709 --> 04:21.500
until all those Petty-posers

04:18.709 --> 04:21.500
are gone.

04:21.542 --> 04:24.166
( sighs ):

04:21.542 --> 04:24.166
How do we get rid

04:21.542 --> 04:24.166
of these things, Doc?

04:24.208 --> 04:26.834
We just need to remove

04:24.208 --> 04:26.834
their collars.

04:29.458 --> 04:33.500
Unh. I now understand why humans

04:29.458 --> 04:33.500
consider herding cats

04:33.542 --> 04:36.250
the benchmark for all

04:33.542 --> 04:36.250
frustrating endeavors.

04:36.291 --> 04:38.792
Cats don't like water, right?

04:38.834 --> 04:40.500
Leave it to me.

04:40.542 --> 04:42.041
( meowing )

04:49.250 --> 04:51.667
( sputters, coughs )

04:51.709 --> 04:53.208
Hey, come on.

04:53.250 --> 04:56.458
You fried my Com.

04:53.250 --> 04:56.458
Whoops. Ha, ha.

04:56.500 --> 04:58.875
Accident. Really.

04:58.917 --> 05:00.250
( buzzing )

05:09.667 --> 05:12.083
It's all right,

05:09.667 --> 05:12.083
Mr. Pettypaws.

05:12.125 --> 05:15.083
All those bad cats

05:12.125 --> 05:15.083
are gone now.

05:15.125 --> 05:16.333
( meows )

05:16.375 --> 05:17.583
( hisses )

05:17.625 --> 05:19.208
And it took you

05:17.625 --> 05:19.208
long enough.

05:24.792 --> 05:26.417
BOULDER:

05:24.792 --> 05:26.417
Thanks for giving us

05:24.792 --> 05:26.417
a demo, Doc.

05:26.458 --> 05:28.458
I'm quite proud

05:26.458 --> 05:28.458
of the technology,

05:28.500 --> 05:30.083
if I do say so myself.

05:30.125 --> 05:31.583
( yawns )

05:34.083 --> 05:36.750
Kade!

05:34.083 --> 05:36.750
What? I missed lunch.

05:36.792 --> 05:38.417
Kade, would you mind

05:38.458 --> 05:40.709
if I hooked you up

05:38.458 --> 05:40.709
for the demonstration?

05:40.750 --> 05:44.417
Just as long as there aren't

05:40.750 --> 05:44.417
any nightmare gremlins involved.

05:44.458 --> 05:46.500
No need to sleep or dream.

05:46.542 --> 05:49.792
Just let any thought

05:46.542 --> 05:49.792
pop into your head.

05:49.834 --> 05:51.375
Thoughts pop in his head,

05:49.834 --> 05:51.375
all right.

05:51.417 --> 05:52.667
Like balloons.

05:52.709 --> 05:54.709
Clear your mind.

05:54.750 --> 05:56.875
Then, when I throw

05:54.750 --> 05:56.875
the switch,

05:56.917 --> 05:58.375
think.

06:00.500 --> 06:02.750
( electricity crackling )

06:04.709 --> 06:06.709
Guess the overwhelming

06:04.709 --> 06:06.709
power of my brain

06:06.750 --> 06:08.041
was too much for it,

06:06.750 --> 06:08.041
huh, Doc?

06:08.083 --> 06:10.625
More likely,

06:08.083 --> 06:10.625
it blew a fuse.

06:10.667 --> 06:12.208
Easily fixed.

06:12.250 --> 06:14.542
( device beeping )

06:14.583 --> 06:16.333
Emergency dispatch.

06:16.375 --> 06:19.166
Cody, there's been a rockslide

06:16.375 --> 06:19.166
on Old Canyon Road.

06:19.208 --> 06:20.959
It's blocked

06:19.208 --> 06:20.959
in both directions.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.208
A car's trapped!

06:21.000 --> 06:23.208
Thanks, Jerry. We'll be--

06:23.250 --> 06:24.667
I got this.

06:24.709 --> 06:27.250
Anybody want to help?

06:29.542 --> 06:32.500
(  dramatic theme playing  )

06:43.333 --> 06:44.875
Hang tight, Mrs. Rubio.

06:44.917 --> 06:46.583
We'll have you out

06:44.917 --> 06:46.583
in half a sec.

06:46.625 --> 06:48.375
More like half a month

06:46.625 --> 06:48.375
at this rate.

06:48.417 --> 06:50.375
Can't you guys

06:48.417 --> 06:50.375
move a few little rocks?

06:50.417 --> 06:51.834
Well, how about we

06:50.417 --> 06:51.834
just take off

06:51.875 --> 06:53.458
and let you

06:51.875 --> 06:53.458
handle everything?

06:53.500 --> 06:55.875
Good idea. Step aside.

06:55.917 --> 06:58.542
Get that one for me,

06:55.917 --> 06:58.542
would you, Heatwave?

06:58.583 --> 07:00.208
( grunts )

07:02.834 --> 07:04.709
Unh! Ah, stuck.

07:04.750 --> 07:06.041
Stand back.

07:07.375 --> 07:09.750
Power up and energize.

07:16.458 --> 07:19.250
( rumbling )

07:19.291 --> 07:22.208
Look out!

07:19.291 --> 07:22.208
( grunting )

07:24.166 --> 07:25.667
Finally.

07:32.500 --> 07:33.959
This should do it.

07:36.208 --> 07:38.166
( whirring )

07:42.083 --> 07:44.500
(  dramatic theme playing  )

07:52.500 --> 07:55.250
Man, you guys

07:52.500 --> 07:55.250
are good-looking.

08:02.709 --> 08:04.709
Nice work, team.

08:05.667 --> 08:07.750
Hey, Kade,

08:05.667 --> 08:07.750
how about helping me

08:07.792 --> 08:10.625
buff out this scratch, huh?

08:07.792 --> 08:10.625
It's hard to reach.

08:10.667 --> 08:12.500
That scratch will

08:10.667 --> 08:12.500
still be there later.

08:12.542 --> 08:14.709
I'm hungry now.

08:14.750 --> 08:16.750
( grunts )

08:16.792 --> 08:20.083
( video game playing )

08:20.125 --> 08:23.166
Everything in the fridge

08:20.125 --> 08:23.166
between two slices of bread.

08:23.208 --> 08:25.375
I call it "The Kade."

08:25.417 --> 08:27.875
Where's the spaghetti?

08:25.417 --> 08:27.875
Under the pudding.

08:27.917 --> 08:30.166
You're not going to eat that

08:27.917 --> 08:30.166
in front of us, are you?

08:30.208 --> 08:33.959
Ah, fine.

08:30.208 --> 08:33.959
I'll go to my room.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.000
( video game playing )

08:41.792 --> 08:43.709
( silverware clangs )

08:43.750 --> 08:45.750
You finished that already?

08:45.792 --> 08:48.291
Maybe you should eat

08:45.792 --> 08:48.291
a little slower.

08:48.333 --> 08:50.834
Maybe you should

08:48.333 --> 08:50.834
mind your own business.

08:53.166 --> 08:55.166
(  light dramatic theme

08:53.166 --> 08:55.166
playing  )

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
( hiccups )

09:05.834 --> 09:07.458
( buffer whirring )

09:07.500 --> 09:09.834
KADE:

09:07.500 --> 09:09.834
Hey, hey, let me

09:07.500 --> 09:09.834
help you with that.

09:09.875 --> 09:11.917
You know what? Why don't you

09:09.875 --> 09:11.917
change to vehicle mode,

09:11.959 --> 09:15.917
it'll be easier.

09:11.959 --> 09:15.917
Okay, what's the catch?

09:15.959 --> 09:18.166
What do you mean?

09:15.959 --> 09:18.166
I just wanna give you a hand.

09:20.083 --> 09:24.250
Let's see, 10-14 is...

09:24.291 --> 09:26.709
livestock on the highway?

09:26.750 --> 09:29.875
Incorrect. The proper answer

09:26.750 --> 09:29.875
is "prowler on premises."

09:29.917 --> 09:32.625
Oh! Do we have

09:29.917 --> 09:32.625
to do this now?

09:32.667 --> 09:36.041
Time, tide, and updated

09:32.667 --> 09:36.041
police codes wait for no man.

09:36.083 --> 09:37.417
KADE:

09:36.083 --> 09:37.417
New 10 codes, eh?

09:37.458 --> 09:39.417
May I get in on this?

09:39.458 --> 09:40.750
Very funny, son.

09:40.792 --> 09:42.417
I'm serious, father.

09:42.458 --> 09:44.875
It's an important part

09:42.458 --> 09:44.875
of being a well-trained EMT.

09:44.917 --> 09:47.333
I am impressed

09:44.917 --> 09:47.333
by your dedication, Kade.

09:47.375 --> 09:50.333
10-27.

09:47.375 --> 09:50.333
Oh, I've got it.

09:50.375 --> 09:53.000
Vehicle registration request.

09:50.375 --> 09:53.000
Am I right?

09:57.333 --> 09:59.709
Hey, Kade.

09:57.333 --> 09:59.709
You must be starving by now.

09:59.750 --> 10:01.083
Better make

09:59.750 --> 10:01.083
another sandwich.

10:01.125 --> 10:02.667
Okay.

10:02.709 --> 10:05.417
( phone rings )

10:05.458 --> 10:08.083
Emergency headquarters.

10:08.125 --> 10:09.542
Sure, hang on.

10:09.583 --> 10:11.875
Kade, it's Hayley.

10:11.917 --> 10:14.792
Hello?

10:11.917 --> 10:14.792
Kade, I want to see you.

10:14.834 --> 10:16.709
You can't.

10:14.834 --> 10:16.709
You're not here.

10:16.750 --> 10:19.458
Okay, bye.

10:16.750 --> 10:19.458
Kade? Wait, I--

10:22.917 --> 10:25.125
Something weird

10:22.917 --> 10:25.125
is going on.

10:26.166 --> 10:27.417
How's it coming, bud?

10:27.458 --> 10:29.208
My arm's getting

10:27.458 --> 10:29.208
a little tired.

10:29.250 --> 10:31.625
Just another few

10:29.250 --> 10:31.625
brush strokes.

10:31.667 --> 10:35.333
Mmm. You want

10:31.667 --> 10:35.333
an athlete to model,

10:35.375 --> 10:36.917
why didn't you ask me?

10:36.959 --> 10:39.000
I can lift my own weight.

10:36.959 --> 10:39.000
Watch.

10:39.041 --> 10:40.959
( grunts )

10:41.000 --> 10:42.583
Ow, my back!

10:42.625 --> 10:45.083
Aah! Ooh! Ah!

10:45.125 --> 10:47.500
Walk it off, walk it off,

10:45.125 --> 10:47.500
walk it off. Ah...

10:47.542 --> 10:50.583
Uh, what was that about?

10:52.792 --> 10:54.792
(  mysterious theme playing  )

10:58.125 --> 11:01.083
How's your back?

10:58.125 --> 11:01.083
Fine. How's yours?

11:01.125 --> 11:03.041
Hey, somebody left

11:01.125 --> 11:03.041
a sandwich.

11:03.083 --> 11:06.083
Mmm. Mm-hm.

11:06.125 --> 11:09.583
Mm-hm. Mmm, yeah.

11:09.625 --> 11:11.417
And one minute

11:09.625 --> 11:11.417
he's in pain, the next--

11:11.458 --> 11:13.041
I know he eats a lot,

11:11.458 --> 11:13.041
but that is just--

11:13.083 --> 11:14.500
Even for Kade it's strange.

11:14.542 --> 11:16.458
First he's a jerk--

11:14.542 --> 11:16.458
It was strange...

11:16.500 --> 11:18.000
Maybe somebody put

11:16.500 --> 11:18.000
an evil spell on him.

11:18.041 --> 11:19.667
I am happy to see

11:18.041 --> 11:19.667
these behavioral changes.

11:19.709 --> 11:21.000
Okay, okay. Settle down.

11:21.041 --> 11:22.333
We'll get to

11:21.041 --> 11:22.333
the bottom of this.

11:22.375 --> 11:24.667
What's everybody doing

11:22.375 --> 11:24.667
down here?

11:24.709 --> 11:26.834
Why do you all

11:24.709 --> 11:26.834
look so serious?

11:26.875 --> 11:30.667
How can you possibly eat

11:26.875 --> 11:30.667
three huge sandwiches in a row?

11:30.709 --> 11:32.208
I'm worried

11:30.709 --> 11:32.208
about your back.

11:32.250 --> 11:33.917
You may think

11:32.250 --> 11:33.917
it's better, but--

11:33.959 --> 11:36.375
Why were you being so nice

11:33.959 --> 11:36.375
to me? It's creepy.

11:36.417 --> 11:38.125
What do you mean?

11:36.417 --> 11:38.125
I'm always nice.

11:38.166 --> 11:41.583
( all talking at once )

11:41.625 --> 11:42.917
( elevator bell dings )

11:42.959 --> 11:44.959
(  dramatic theme playing  )

11:47.166 --> 11:49.959
Huh?

11:47.166 --> 11:49.959
( all gasp )

11:50.000 --> 11:53.083
There is lots of me.

11:53.125 --> 11:55.041
Four more Kades?

11:55.083 --> 11:57.750
Ugh. Just what

11:55.083 --> 11:57.750
the world needs.

11:59.125 --> 12:01.500
What are you looking at?

12:01.542 --> 12:04.375
You don't have

12:01.542 --> 12:04.375
to be so rude.

12:04.417 --> 12:06.834
You know,

12:04.417 --> 12:06.834
if I always wore slippers,

12:06.875 --> 12:09.083
I would never have

12:06.875 --> 12:09.083
to tie my shoes.

12:09.125 --> 12:11.041
Good thinking.

12:09.125 --> 12:11.041
Very practical.

12:11.083 --> 12:14.000
Wha...?

12:11.083 --> 12:14.000
Uh, I, uh...

12:14.041 --> 12:15.291
( beeping )

12:15.333 --> 12:16.875
Chief, are you there?

12:16.917 --> 12:18.834
We're all here, Doc.

12:18.875 --> 12:21.166
Along with a few guests.

12:21.208 --> 12:23.166
The strangest thing

12:21.208 --> 12:23.166
happened.

12:23.208 --> 12:24.458
I was just going over

12:24.500 --> 12:26.333
the security video

12:24.500 --> 12:26.333
at the lab.

12:26.375 --> 12:28.709
Apparently, the chamber

12:26.375 --> 12:28.709
had already started

12:28.750 --> 12:31.500
processing Kade's thoughts

12:28.750 --> 12:31.500
when the fuse blew.

12:31.542 --> 12:33.125
When I replaced it--

12:33.166 --> 12:35.667
The chamber powered up

12:33.166 --> 12:35.667
and completed the job.

12:35.709 --> 12:37.750
Kade must have been

12:35.709 --> 12:37.750
thinking about himself.

12:37.792 --> 12:39.709
There's a shock.

12:37.792 --> 12:39.709
It is odd

12:39.750 --> 12:42.458
that the manifestations

12:39.750 --> 12:42.458
of Kade left the lab,

12:42.500 --> 12:45.583
but with no power source

12:42.500 --> 12:45.583
to fuel the energy crystals,

12:45.625 --> 12:48.500
I'm certain that they've all

12:45.625 --> 12:48.500
disappeared by now.

12:48.542 --> 12:50.458
Not quite, Doc.

12:51.792 --> 12:54.333
Great Fermi's neutrons!

12:54.375 --> 12:56.750
A colony of Kades.

12:56.792 --> 12:59.500
But how do they exist

12:56.792 --> 12:59.500
without a power source?

12:59.542 --> 13:02.333
More important, how do we

12:59.542 --> 13:02.333
get rid of them?

13:02.375 --> 13:04.125
KADE:

13:02.375 --> 13:04.125
Well, hey, hey,

13:02.375 --> 13:04.125
no hurry.

13:04.166 --> 13:07.125
I finally got myself

13:04.166 --> 13:07.125
a basketball team.

13:07.166 --> 13:09.041
Let's go, Kades.

13:10.250 --> 13:11.500
Okay, boys.

13:11.542 --> 13:13.333
Now that you're all

13:11.542 --> 13:13.333
color coded,

13:13.375 --> 13:16.250
let's see if you all share

13:13.375 --> 13:16.250
my awesome physical abilities.

13:16.291 --> 13:17.500
Show me what you got.

13:17.542 --> 13:18.875
(  upbeat theme playing  )

13:22.625 --> 13:25.208
Okay, now move

13:22.625 --> 13:25.208
the ball around.

13:29.291 --> 13:30.875
BOTH (in unison):

13:29.291 --> 13:30.875
Come on.

13:30.917 --> 13:34.250
Sorry. I was thinking

13:30.917 --> 13:34.250
about marshmallows.

13:34.291 --> 13:37.125
Hm. Interesting.

13:37.166 --> 13:39.917
They each appear to exhibit

13:37.166 --> 13:39.917
different behavior.

13:39.959 --> 13:42.583
So they're not

13:39.959 --> 13:42.583
exact copies?

13:42.625 --> 13:43.959
Each one seems to be

13:44.000 --> 13:46.542
an extreme part

13:44.000 --> 13:46.542
of Kade's personality.

13:46.583 --> 13:47.792
Hey, back off, Red.

13:47.834 --> 13:49.542
We're all on

13:47.834 --> 13:49.542
the same side here.

13:49.583 --> 13:51.041
Then play like it.

13:51.083 --> 13:53.166
Geez, why can't you

13:51.083 --> 13:53.166
all be like me?

13:53.208 --> 13:54.625
Oh, now you're

13:53.208 --> 13:54.625
mocking me?

13:54.667 --> 13:56.291
Come on, guys.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.291
Break it up.

13:56.333 --> 13:59.208
Hm. Instead of just

13:56.333 --> 13:59.208
running all over the place,

13:59.250 --> 14:01.083
here's a new play

13:59.250 --> 14:01.083
I came up with.

14:01.125 --> 14:02.333
Running all over the place?

14:02.375 --> 14:04.083
This is

14:02.375 --> 14:04.083
a tried-and-true offense.

14:04.125 --> 14:06.417
Tried-and-failed

14:04.125 --> 14:06.417
is more like it.

14:06.458 --> 14:08.291
Who do you think

14:06.458 --> 14:08.291
you're talking to?

14:08.333 --> 14:10.458
Well, right now you're

14:08.333 --> 14:10.458
talking to yourself, genius.

14:10.500 --> 14:12.792
These zeroes are the forwards.

An emergency.

This is Chief Burns.

14:26.792 --> 14:28.208

by the rockslide.

Cody,

14:32.083 --> 14:33.417
take the command center.

14:33.458 --> 14:37.000
Kade, all your friends

14:33.458 --> 14:37.000
better come along.

14:37.041 --> 14:39.375
We can't leave them

14:37.041 --> 14:39.375
on their own.

14:41.875 --> 14:44.458
Mm, what a smooth ride.

14:44.500 --> 14:46.041
You're good at this.

14:46.083 --> 14:49.208
Can we keep him?

14:46.083 --> 14:49.208
Please?

14:49.250 --> 14:52.291
Come on, Heatwave, push it.

14:49.250 --> 14:52.291
We have to be there first.

14:52.333 --> 14:54.291
Dude, I'm only telling you this

14:52.333 --> 14:54.291
because you're me,

14:54.333 --> 14:55.792
but you're getting

14:54.333 --> 14:55.792
a little annoying.

15:03.792 --> 15:05.000
Guys, be careful!

15:05.041 --> 15:07.750
HEATWAVE:

15:05.041 --> 15:07.750
Ugh! Both of you let go.

15:07.792 --> 15:09.417
Or-- Aah!

15:09.458 --> 15:10.709
( both yell )

15:14.083 --> 15:16.959
(  dramatic theme playing  )

15:18.834 --> 15:20.834
( grunts then yells )

15:33.166 --> 15:34.375
Everybody okay, Dad?

15:34.417 --> 15:36.834
This time.

15:34.417 --> 15:36.834
But these extra Kades

15:36.875 --> 15:39.542
have to go before

15:36.875 --> 15:39.542
they do more damage.

15:39.583 --> 15:41.250
We'll take care

15:39.583 --> 15:41.250
of the gas leak,

15:41.291 --> 15:43.875
you take your posse

15:41.291 --> 15:43.875
back to the firehouse

15:43.917 --> 15:45.333
and get a hold of Doc.

15:45.375 --> 15:46.583
Maybe he's come up

15:45.375 --> 15:46.583
with a way

15:46.625 --> 15:47.917
of getting rid of them

15:46.625 --> 15:47.917
by now.

15:47.959 --> 15:49.500
HEATWAVE:

15:47.959 --> 15:49.500
I'm not driving them.

15:49.542 --> 15:51.667
You'll be lucky if I ever

15:49.542 --> 15:51.667
give you a ride again.

15:51.709 --> 15:53.917
Then how do we

15:51.709 --> 15:53.917
all get back?

15:55.625 --> 15:58.625
All right, nobody

15:55.625 --> 15:58.625
touches anything. Got it?

15:58.667 --> 16:01.667
Hey, watch your elbow.

15:58.667 --> 16:01.667
Sorry.

16:01.709 --> 16:03.458
Clouds look funny from above.

16:03.500 --> 16:06.750
I think you have my seat belt.

16:03.500 --> 16:06.750
Guys, guys, please.

16:06.792 --> 16:08.208
( groans )

16:10.208 --> 16:13.375
Hello?

16:10.208 --> 16:13.375
Hayley, what are you--

16:13.417 --> 16:15.625
I told Kade I was coming over.

16:13.417 --> 16:15.625
Is he around?

16:15.667 --> 16:19.709
Which one? I mean,

16:15.667 --> 16:19.709
no, he, uh...

16:21.125 --> 16:24.000
I'll go look for him.

16:21.125 --> 16:24.000
Wait here, okay?

16:27.500 --> 16:31.166
That was

16:27.500 --> 16:31.166
the longest trip of my life.

16:31.208 --> 16:34.000
Kade!

16:31.208 --> 16:34.000
( all respond )

16:34.041 --> 16:35.583
Hayley's downstairs.

16:35.625 --> 16:37.583
The rest of you

16:35.625 --> 16:37.583
will have to wait up here.

16:37.625 --> 16:39.583
Uh, she wants me

16:37.625 --> 16:39.583
to apologize.

16:39.625 --> 16:42.291
Never apologize,

16:39.625 --> 16:42.291
it's a sign of weakness.

16:42.333 --> 16:44.750
No. Relationships

16:42.333 --> 16:44.750
require communication.

16:44.792 --> 16:46.000
I like penguins.

16:46.041 --> 16:48.917
Flowers.

16:46.041 --> 16:48.917
And ask forgiveness.

16:48.959 --> 16:50.917
No way this guy's

16:48.959 --> 16:50.917
part of me.

16:50.959 --> 16:52.458
They're all

16:50.959 --> 16:52.458
a part of you.

16:52.500 --> 16:54.333
Like a one-person

16:52.500 --> 16:54.333
family,

16:54.375 --> 16:57.208
where everyone kind of

16:54.375 --> 16:57.208
balances each other out.

16:57.250 --> 16:58.500
You go apologize for me.

16:58.542 --> 17:00.250
I'll just

16:58.542 --> 17:00.250
mess it up worse.

17:00.291 --> 17:02.750
No. If he can do it,

17:00.291 --> 17:02.750
you can.

17:02.792 --> 17:04.000
He is you.

17:04.041 --> 17:06.417
Cody's right.

17:04.041 --> 17:06.417
Give it a shot.

17:07.750 --> 17:09.166
All right.

17:16.375 --> 17:18.458
He is so gonna say

17:16.375 --> 17:18.458
the wrong thing.

17:18.500 --> 17:20.333
I think

17:18.500 --> 17:20.333
he'll get it right.

17:24.834 --> 17:26.542
Noble.

17:24.834 --> 17:26.542
Told ya.

17:24.834 --> 17:26.542
Well done.

17:26.583 --> 17:29.834
Eh, not bad. For a twerp.

17:32.917 --> 17:35.500
(  dramatic theme playing  )

17:35.542 --> 17:37.458
GRAHAM:

17:35.542 --> 17:37.458
There's the leak.

17:37.500 --> 17:39.583
( grunts )

17:39.625 --> 17:41.041
The main valve's stuck.

17:41.083 --> 17:42.959
It must have been hit

17:41.083 --> 17:42.959
by one of those rocks, too.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.375
All right, we better evacuate

17:43.000 --> 17:45.375
the area before--

17:49.417 --> 17:51.208
( alarm blaring )

17:51.250 --> 17:54.291
Power up and energize!

17:57.750 --> 18:00.542
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

18:07.125 --> 18:09.333
Everybody...

18:09.375 --> 18:10.959
inside.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.458
Unfortunately,

18:11.000 --> 18:13.458
I haven't a clue

18:13.500 --> 18:15.583
why the Kade doppelgangers

18:13.500 --> 18:15.583
are still around.

18:15.625 --> 18:17.041
With no energy source,

18:17.083 --> 18:18.834
they should have

18:17.083 --> 18:18.834
disappeared long ago.

18:18.875 --> 18:21.709
Which means they must have

18:18.875 --> 18:21.709
an energy source.

18:21.750 --> 18:23.000
The donut!

18:23.041 --> 18:25.083
Kade, you had one

18:23.041 --> 18:25.083
in your pocket

18:25.125 --> 18:26.875
when you were hooked up

18:25.125 --> 18:26.875
to the machine, right?

18:26.917 --> 18:28.166
Do you still have it?

18:30.000 --> 18:31.500
Me too.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.500
Chocolate!

18:31.542 --> 18:33.125
I never throw anything away.

18:31.542 --> 18:33.125
I ate mine.

18:33.166 --> 18:34.375
So what are you saying?

18:34.417 --> 18:35.959
That donuts are

18:34.417 --> 18:35.959
powering these guys?

18:36.000 --> 18:37.375
Not the donut.

18:37.417 --> 18:38.834
Of course.

18:38.875 --> 18:40.959
Brilliant observation, Cody.

18:41.000 --> 18:43.083
If you, the original Kade,

18:43.125 --> 18:45.500
were carrying some sort

18:43.125 --> 18:45.500
of energy source,

18:45.542 --> 18:47.583
it could have replicated

18:45.542 --> 18:47.583
to the others

18:47.625 --> 18:49.375
just as the donut did.

18:49.417 --> 18:52.125
But I'm not carrying any--

18:52.166 --> 18:56.041
My Com-Link.

18:52.166 --> 18:56.041
The battery's still sparking.

18:56.083 --> 18:58.583
It's been putting out

18:56.083 --> 18:58.583
a low level of power.

18:58.625 --> 19:01.583
Enough to keep

18:58.625 --> 19:01.583
the energy crystals vibrating.

19:01.625 --> 19:05.000
Kade, all you have to do

19:01.625 --> 19:05.000
is take away their Com-Links.

19:05.041 --> 19:06.709
Once the manifestations

19:05.041 --> 19:06.709
are separated

19:06.750 --> 19:09.125
from their energy source,

19:06.750 --> 19:09.125
they'll disappear.

19:09.166 --> 19:12.542
Well, guys, breaking up

19:09.166 --> 19:12.542
is hard to do, but...

19:12.583 --> 19:15.083
Cody, Kade,

19:12.583 --> 19:15.083
can you read me?

19:15.125 --> 19:17.709
We're here, Dad.

19:15.125 --> 19:17.709
CHIEF: We need your help.

19:17.750 --> 19:19.166
We're at the reservoir.

19:19.208 --> 19:21.667
The entire team

19:19.208 --> 19:21.667
is hemmed in by flames.

19:21.709 --> 19:22.917
Don't worry, Dad.

19:22.959 --> 19:26.125
I got another team

19:22.959 --> 19:26.125
right here.

19:26.166 --> 19:28.959
( siren blaring )

19:31.208 --> 19:33.583
(  dramatic theme playing  )

19:34.834 --> 19:35.834
( grunts )

19:35.875 --> 19:38.417
Water reserves

19:35.875 --> 19:38.417
are almost depleted.

19:45.834 --> 19:47.875
Blades, get Dani

19:45.834 --> 19:47.875
and Graham out of here.

19:47.917 --> 19:50.625
We're not leaving you

19:47.917 --> 19:50.625
behind, Dad.

19:50.667 --> 19:53.834
They're right, Chief.

19:50.667 --> 19:53.834
Too dangerous. We'll get this.

19:58.625 --> 19:59.917
( all gasp )

20:01.834 --> 20:03.291
( grunts )

20:10.834 --> 20:14.500
(  triumphant theme playing  )

20:17.041 --> 20:18.709
Me, man the secondary pump.

20:18.750 --> 20:20.375
Other me,

20:18.750 --> 20:20.375
grab the hoses.

20:20.417 --> 20:22.667
You guys of me,

20:20.417 --> 20:22.667
get the foam gun.

20:22.709 --> 20:25.291
No talking back.

20:22.709 --> 20:25.291
The real Kade's in charge.

20:37.041 --> 20:39.250
Nice work, guys.

20:37.041 --> 20:39.250
Who do we thank first?

20:39.291 --> 20:41.583
Me.

20:41.625 --> 20:42.834
Him.

20:42.875 --> 20:45.000
One thing you all

20:42.875 --> 20:45.000
have in common:

20:45.041 --> 20:46.625
you're heroes.

20:45.041 --> 20:46.625
Every one of you.

20:46.667 --> 20:48.083
Well, I am.

20:48.125 --> 20:49.834
They're just, you know,

20:49.875 --> 20:52.291
the parts that make me, me.

20:52.333 --> 20:53.959
Thanks, everybody.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.792
For putting up

20:54.000 --> 20:55.792
with all of them.

20:55.834 --> 20:57.917
Well, guys, I can't think

20:55.834 --> 20:57.917
of a better-looking crew

20:57.959 --> 21:01.041
to hang out with,

20:57.959 --> 21:01.041
but time to hand them over.

21:01.083 --> 21:03.500
(  light dramatic theme

21:01.083 --> 21:03.500
playing  )

21:14.750 --> 21:17.709
Is it weird to say

21:14.750 --> 21:17.709
I'm gonna miss those guys?

21:17.750 --> 21:19.834
Well, some of them.

21:19.875 --> 21:21.083
The nice you.

21:21.125 --> 21:23.583
Well, maybe

21:21.125 --> 21:23.583
he'll be around more.

21:23.625 --> 21:26.166
He might even pass you

21:23.625 --> 21:26.166
the basketball once in a while.

21:27.875 --> 21:29.917
ALL (in unison):

Nah!
