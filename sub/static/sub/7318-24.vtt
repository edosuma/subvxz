WEBVTT

00:12.800 --> 00:15.167
PREVIOUSLY
ON "GREY'S ANATOMY"...

00:15.200 --> 00:17.567
I SLEPT WITH GEORGE.
IT WAS A HORRIBLE MISTAKE.

00:17.600 --> 00:20.467
I HAVE NO INTEREST IN OBSTETRICS
OR GYNECOLOGY, DR. SHEPHERD.

00:20.500 --> 00:23.367
YOUR ASS IS MINE
UNTIL I SAY OTHERWISE.

00:23.400 --> 00:25.533
SO WE SPENT THE NIGHT
AT CALLIE'S LAST NIGHT.

00:25.567 --> 00:28.067
SO I FIGURED WE'D JUST
SPEND THE NIGHT HERE.
OH, HI.

00:28.100 --> 00:29.367
YOU'RE FALLING FOR A VET.

00:29.400 --> 00:33.067
I'M ALSO DATING. YOU.
IF YOU STILL WANT TO.

00:33.100 --> 00:35.333
I GOT HOME. HE WAS LISTLESS
AND HADN'T EATEN ALL DAY.

00:35.367 --> 00:37.100
OH, NO. LET'S HAVE A LOOK.
HEY.

00:37.133 --> 00:38.733
HEY. IS HE SICK AGAIN?

00:38.767 --> 00:40.033
YEAH.

00:42.533 --> 00:44.433
(Meredith)
WE ALL GO THROUGH LIFE

00:44.467 --> 00:47.167
LIKE BULLS IN A CHINA SHOP--

00:47.200 --> 00:48.700
A CHIP HERE, A CRACK THERE,

00:48.733 --> 00:51.033
DOING DAMAGE...

00:51.067 --> 00:54.333
TO OURSELVES,
TO OTHER PEOPLE.

00:56.200 --> 00:58.733
SO, UH, I DON'T COOK.

00:58.767 --> 01:00.767
NOBODY ASKED YOU TO COOK.
I KNOW.

01:00.800 --> 01:03.167
I'M JUST SAYING THAT,
YOU KNOW, I DON'T COOK.

01:03.200 --> 01:04.667
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO COOK.

01:04.700 --> 01:06.533
I DON'T EXPECT YOU
TO COOK FOR ME.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.467
OKAY. YOU--SIT THERE.

01:08.500 --> 01:09.700
SIT DOWN.

01:09.733 --> 01:13.100
I WANT YOU TO DRINK THIS
AND TRY REALLY HARD

01:13.133 --> 01:16.100
TO ACT LIKE YOU AREN'T
SCARY AND DAMAGED.

01:16.133 --> 01:19.133
I'M NOT SCARY AND DAMAGED.
YEAH, YOU ARE.

01:19.167 --> 01:21.633
NO!
I'M NOT SCARY OR DAMAGED.

01:21.667 --> 01:23.600
MM-HMM. ALL RIGHT.

01:23.633 --> 01:26.133
THEN WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME
ABOUT YOUR FAMILY?

01:26.167 --> 01:27.667
OKAY...

01:27.700 --> 01:29.600
ME NOT WANTING TO TALK
ABOUT MY FAMILY

01:29.633 --> 01:31.633
DOES NOT MAKE ME SCARY
OR DAMAGED.

01:31.667 --> 01:33.333
OKAY.

01:33.367 --> 01:36.267
TELL ME ABOUT THE LAST GUY
YOU SLEPT WITH.

01:36.300 --> 01:38.200
THE PROBLEM
IS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

01:38.233 --> 01:40.367
HOW TO CONTROL
THE DAMAGE WE'VE DONE,

01:40.400 --> 01:43.233
OR THAT'S BEEN DONE TO US.

01:43.267 --> 01:45.167
WHAT DID YOU SAY TO HIM?

01:45.200 --> 01:46.700
NOTHING. I FLED THE SCENE.

01:46.733 --> 01:48.767
(muffled voice) YOU DIDN'T
TELL HIM ABOUT GEORGE

01:48.800 --> 01:50.100
OR DEREK?
NOPE.

01:50.133 --> 01:52.467
HMM. YOU LIKE HIM.

01:52.500 --> 01:53.600
I COULD LIKE HIM.

01:53.633 --> 01:55.467
IS THE SEX ANY GOOD?

01:55.500 --> 01:57.400
I DON'T KNOW.

01:57.433 --> 01:59.467
FOUR DATES AND TWO SLEEPOVERS
AT HIS PLACE, AND NO SEX?

01:59.500 --> 02:01.567
NOT EVEN A KISS GOOD NIGHT.

02:01.600 --> 02:04.267
OH, I AM PROUD.

02:04.300 --> 02:06.800
I'M LIKE A PROUD MAMA.

02:06.833 --> 02:08.200
SHUT UP.

02:08.233 --> 02:10.233
(laughs)

02:12.800 --> 02:15.533
MORNIN'.

02:18.600 --> 02:23.567
SOMETIMES THE DAMAGE
CATCHES US BY SURPRISE.

02:29.800 --> 02:33.800
(toilet flushes)

02:36.567 --> 02:39.567
OH, MY GOD.
DID THAT JUST HAPPEN?

02:39.600 --> 02:41.733
I'M HAVING A SEIZURE.
I'M CLEARLY MID-SEIZURE.

02:41.767 --> 02:44.333
I'M SEIZING.
OH, MY GOD.

02:44.367 --> 02:46.400
SHE DIDN'T EVEN
WASH HER HANDS.

02:46.433 --> 02:48.367
(whispers) OH, MY GOD.
(laughs)

02:48.400 --> 02:51.267
SOMETIMES WE THINK
WE CAN FIX THE DAMAGE.

02:51.300 --> 02:53.467
ALL I'M SAYING, GEORGE,
IS IF SHE NEEDS TO PEE,

02:53.500 --> 02:55.133
SHE COULD AT LEAST
WEAR A BRA.

02:55.167 --> 02:56.367
OR MAYBE WAIT
TILL SHE'S ALONE.

02:56.400 --> 02:58.300
AND FOR THE LOVE
OF EVERYTHING SANITARY,

02:58.333 --> 03:00.767
COULD SHE JUST WASH HER HANDS?
SHE'S A SURGEON.

03:00.800 --> 03:02.367
YOU SAID YOURSELF YOU GUYS
WERE BLOCKING THE SINK.

03:02.400 --> 03:05.533
ANYWAY, I THINK
YOU'RE EXAGGERATING.
SHE PEED. NAKED PEEING.
ASK MEREDITH.

03:05.567 --> 03:07.600
OH, THAT'S RIGHT, I FORGOT.
YOU'RE NOT TALKING TO HER.

03:07.633 --> 03:10.767
IF YOU WERE, SHE WOULD TELL YOU
THAT CALLIE CROSSES THE LINE.

03:10.800 --> 03:12.533
SO ACROSS THE LINE.

03:12.567 --> 03:14.333
IT'S SO FREAKIN' CROSSED.

03:14.367 --> 03:16.200
OH! WE'RE STILL PRETENDING

03:16.233 --> 03:18.133
THAT YOU'RE NOT SEEING
A PATIENT, RIGHT?

03:18.167 --> 03:19.433
(siren wails)

03:19.467 --> 03:22.800
PEOPLE, WHAT'S WITH ALL
THE EVIL MISERY, HUH?

03:22.833 --> 03:25.233
LIVE AND LET LIVE.

03:26.700 --> 03:28.167
YOU'RE CHEERFUL.
OH!

03:28.200 --> 03:29.567
YOU ARE.
COME ON.

03:29.600 --> 03:32.067
HOW'S THAT POSSIBLE?
I SCRUBBED IN ON

03:32.067 --> 03:33.800
A 4-HOUR PARAESOPHAGEAL HERNIA
LAST NIGHT,

03:33.833 --> 03:35.333
THEN I GOT LAID,

03:35.367 --> 03:37.267
AND NOW THREE AMBULANCES
ARE COMING IN

03:37.300 --> 03:39.200
FULL OF BLOODY,
BROKEN CAR CRASH VICTIMS,

03:39.233 --> 03:41.233
ALL WHO NEED TO BE
CUT OPEN.

03:41.267 --> 03:42.367
SO I'M CHEERFUL.
I'M CHEERFUL...

03:42.400 --> 03:45.800
AND SOMETIMES THE DAMAGE
IS SOMETHING WE CAN'T EVEN SEE.

03:45.833 --> 03:47.333
I'M CHEERFUL!
(sighs)

03:47.367 --> 03:48.800
SORRY, SIR.

03:48.833 --> 03:50.733
HEY.
HOW'S MY DOG?

03:50.767 --> 03:52.567
MUCH BETTER.
FINN'S RUNNING TESTS.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.567
OUR DOG.
WHAT?

03:54.600 --> 03:57.767
OUR DOG. YOU SAID "MY DOG."
HE'S OUR DOG.

03:57.800 --> 03:59.633
YEAH, WHATEVER.

03:59.667 --> 04:01.433
ARE YOU MAD AT ME
OR SOMETHING?

04:01.467 --> 04:04.433
NOW IS NOT THE TIME.

04:04.467 --> 04:06.167
25-YEAR-OLD RESTRAINED DRIVER,
NOAH REYNOLDS.

04:06.200 --> 04:07.200

04:09.867 --> 04:12.267
NOAH, YOU STILL ALIVE?

04:12.300 --> 04:13.767
I'M STILL ALIVE, BABY.

04:13.800 --> 04:15.667
MY WIFE'S SIDE
TOOK ALL THE IMPACT.

04:15.700 --> 04:17.600
HER PARENTS WERE IN
THE OTHER CAR.

04:17.633 --> 04:20.500
SOME JERK SLAMMED INTO THEM
AND THEN THEY SLAMMED INTO US.

04:20.533 --> 04:23.200
ON THREE.
ONE, TWO, THREE.

04:23.233 --> 04:25.133

04:31.167 --> 04:32.700
TRAUMA?
NO, I'M FINE, REALLY.

04:32.733 --> 04:34.633
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO
TO ALL THAT TROUBLE.

04:34.667 --> 04:36.567
MERCY, NO, I AM FINE, REALLY.
THE AIR BAGS WENT OFF.

04:36.600 --> 04:38.200
IF YOU COULD JUST CHECK
ON MY BABY

04:38.233 --> 04:39.667
AND THE REST OF MY FAMILY
AND MY HUSBAND.

04:39.700 --> 04:41.700
NOAH, YOU SAW
MAMA BREATHING, RIGHT?

04:41.733 --> 04:43.533
AND DADDY--
WHERE THE HELL'S DADDY?

04:43.567 --> 04:45.467
MAMA AND DADDY
ARE STILL ALIVE, RIGHT?

04:45.500 --> 04:47.467
THEY'RE IN THE AMBULANCE
RIGHT BEHIND US.

04:47.500 --> 04:49.200
THEY'RE STILL ALIVE, RIGHT?

04:49.233 --> 04:50.367
PLEASE DON'T MOVE, MA'AM.

04:50.400 --> 04:52.300
MAMA AND DADDY--
I NEED TO KNOW.

04:52.333 --> 04:55.133
YEAH, I'LL ASK SOMEONE

04:55.167 --> 04:57.200
DRIVER AND FRONT SEAT PASSENGER,

04:57.233 --> 04:58.733
BOTH RESTRAINED,
BOTH STABLE.

04:58.767 --> 05:00.600
THE PASSENGER HAS
SOME LEG AND ARM PAIN.

05:00.633 --> 05:02.500
THE DRIVER IS COMPLAINING
OF CHEST PAIN.

05:02.533 --> 05:03.667
SHOOT!
DANG IT ALL TO HECK!

05:03.700 --> 05:05.600
EXCUSE MY FRENCH, HONEY,

05:18.367 --> 05:20.267
SIR, I NEED TO CLEAR
YOUR SPINE.

05:20.300 --> 05:23.167
MY SPINE IS FINE AND YOU CAN
SEW UP MY HEAD LATER.

05:23.200 --> 05:24.833
WHERE'S MY GIRL? MELLIE!

05:24.867 --> 05:26.167
DADDY.

05:27.700 --> 05:28.667
(Mel) MAMA.

05:28.700 --> 05:30.567
THE HILLBILLY PICNIC.

05:30.600 --> 05:32.833
CAN EVERYBODY SHUT UP
FOR A MINUTE, PLEASE?

05:32.867 --> 05:35.200
I'M TRYING TO FIND
A FETAL HEARTBEAT. HOLD ON.

05:35.233 --> 05:37.300
IS THE BABY OKAY?
HOLD ON.

05:38.667 --> 05:40.567
(fetal heartbeat plays
over ultrasound machine)

05:40.600 --> 05:42.500
THE BABY'S HEARTBEAT
IS 152 AND STRONG.

05:42.533 --> 05:44.067
IT'S--IT'S OKAY.

05:44.067 --> 05:46.800
THEY'RE BOTH GOOD.

05:46.833 --> 05:48.300
OH, THANK THE LORD.

05:48.333 --> 05:50.100

THEY'RE ALL RIGHT.

05:50.133 --> 05:52.633
(Meredith) DR. BAILEY,
ANOTHER CAR CRASH VICTIM.

05:52.667 --> 05:55.367
THAT'S HIM!
THAT'S THE GUY WHO HIT US.

05:55.400 --> 05:58.200
I'LL KILL HIM!
I'M GONNA GET YOU!

05:58.233 --> 06:00.367
YOU SON OF A BITCH.

06:00.400 --> 06:02.300
BIG JIM,
JUST HOLD YOUR HORSES.

06:02.333 --> 06:03.600
HE'S HURT.

06:03.633 --> 06:05.267
DADDY!

WHAT HAPPENED?

06:11.833 --> 06:13.200
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

06:13.233 --> 06:15.133
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOIN', YOUNG MAN?

06:15.167 --> 06:16.767
I'M JUST TRYING
TO EXAMINE YOU.
I DON'T THINK SO.

06:16.800 --> 06:18.700
(whispers) I DON'T HAVE
ANY PANTIES ON.

06:18.733 --> 06:21.600
I DO NOT KNOW YOU WELL ENOUGH
TO LET YOU SEE MY GOOD GIRL.

06:21.633 --> 06:23.533
(normal voice)
GET ME A LADY DOCTOR.

06:23.567 --> 06:25.567
I NEED A CHICK OVER HERE.

06:25.600 --> 06:27.367

06:27.400 --> 06:30.433
SURGICAL INTERN

WHAT HAPPENED?

06:30.467 --> 06:32.733
PAGE ORTHO TO TAKE A LOOK
AT HIS WRIST

06:32.767 --> 06:35.067

06:35.100 --> 06:36.833
MARSHALL, I'M GONNA SAY
THREE WORDS TO YOU, OKAY?

06:36.867 --> 06:38.767
AND THEN I WANT YOU TO REPEAT
THEM BACK TO DR. GREY.

06:38.800 --> 06:40.500
CAN YOU DO THAT?
OKAY.

06:40.533 --> 06:41.667
OKAY, BAT, ORANGE, CAR.

06:41.700 --> 06:43.600
DO YOU THINK
YOU CAN REMEMBER THAT?

06:43.633 --> 06:44.567
MM-HMM.

06:44.600 --> 06:47.667
GOOD. OKAY. HERE.

06:47.700 --> 06:49.600
HE HAS A CLOSED HEAD INJURY.

06:49.633 --> 06:52.200
WATCH FOR VOMITING, CONFUSION

06:52.233 --> 06:53.367
AND LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS,
OKAY?

06:53.400 --> 06:54.333
OKAY.

06:54.367 --> 06:55.367
GOOD.

06:55.400 --> 06:56.767
DEREK--

06:56.800 --> 06:58.133

06:58.167 --> 07:00.800
LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU GET
THE C.T. REPORT BACK.

07:02.733 --> 07:04.800
MARSHALL...

07:04.833 --> 07:08.067
CAN YOU REMEMBER THOSE WORDS?

07:08.067 --> 07:09.600
WHAT--WHAT HAPPENED?

07:17.467 --> 07:19.367
AND THIS IS THE FATHER--
BIG JIM.

07:19.400 --> 07:20.600
I DON'T CALL HIM BIG JIM.

07:20.633 --> 07:22.533
THE FAMILY,
THEY CALL HIM BIG JIM.

07:22.567 --> 07:24.200
STUPID HICKS.

07:24.233 --> 07:26.133
REALLY? BEING SOUTHERN
MAKES YOU STUPID?

07:26.167 --> 07:28.067
DO YOU KNOW THAT HE OWNS
HALF OF ALABAMA?

07:28.100 --> 07:30.267
YEAH, I BET HE EVEN WASHES
HIS HANDS AFTER HE PEES.

07:30.300 --> 07:31.767
THAT'S UNCALLED FOR.

07:31.800 --> 07:33.700
HEY, THIS IS A PLACE
OF BUSINESS.

07:33.733 --> 07:35.633
UH, DISCHARGE THE MOTHER,
DISCHARGE THE FATHER.
YES, DR. BAILEY.

07:35.667 --> 07:37.567
KAREV, GET THE HUSBAND
TO THE O.R. FOR SURGERY.

07:37.600 --> 07:39.500
DR. KAREV, THERE YOU ARE.
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE

07:39.533 --> 07:42.267

ROUNDING ON MY PATIENTS.

07:42.300 --> 07:44.667
OH, YEAH, I GOT PAGED.
9-1-1.

07:44.700 --> 07:47.433
PREGNANT MOM. CAR ACCIDENT.
VERY SERIOUS.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.367
PITY. I'VE GOT THREE SURGERIES
ON THE BOARD.

07:49.400 --> 07:51.300
I WAS GONNA ASK YOU
TO SCRUB IN, BUT...

07:51.333 --> 07:54.167
I GUESS YOU SHOULD STAY BY THAT
PREGNANT LADY'S SIDE ALL DAY.

07:54.200 --> 07:57.100
YOU'LL SEE TO IT,
DR. BAILEY?

07:58.733 --> 08:00.100
KAREV, GO FIND YOUR PATIENT.

08:00.133 --> 08:02.833
STEVENS, SCRUB IN ON NOAH'S
PATELLA FRACTURE.

08:02.867 --> 08:04.300
THE SHE-SHEPHERD
JUST WALKS IN HERE

08:04.333 --> 08:06.233
AND PULLS ME OFF SURGERY?

08:06.267 --> 08:09.367
YOU BURN THE SHE-SHEPHERD,
SHE BURNS BACK. GO.

08:11.600 --> 08:13.500
THE C.T. WON'T HURT THE BABY
OR NOTHIN', RIGHT?

08:13.533 --> 08:17.100
NO, IT WON'T HURT THE BABY
OR NOTHIN'.

08:17.133 --> 08:18.567
OKAY, ON THREE.
ONE, TWO, THREE.

08:18.600 --> 08:21.467
I WAS HAVIN' A SHOWER TODAY.
A BABY SHOWER.

08:21.500 --> 08:23.133
(laughs)

08:23.167 --> 08:24.767
THAT'S WHY MAMA AND DADDY
ARE IN TOWN,

08:24.800 --> 08:26.467
'CAUSE I'M HAVING A BABY.

08:26.500 --> 08:27.800
HOW NICE IS THAT?

08:27.833 --> 08:29.367
NICE.

08:29.400 --> 08:31.400
ISN'T IT?
MM-HMM.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

08:31.433 --> 08:32.667
I'M CAPTAIN
OF THE VAGINA SQUAD.

08:32.700 --> 08:35.467
OH, THIS NICE MAN
IS GONNA TAKE CARE OF YOU NOW.

08:35.500 --> 08:37.400
AND HE REALLY LIKES TO TALK,
SO CHAT AWAY.

08:37.433 --> 08:39.667
WELL, IT WAS NICE MEETING YOU.
NOT COOL, YANG.

08:39.700 --> 08:41.067
WHAT DOES SHE MEAN, "CAPTAIN"?

08:41.067 --> 08:43.400
AND WHAT KIND OF SQUAD
ARE YOU ON?

08:46.167 --> 08:48.067
UH, YOU SHOULDN'T BE READING
YOUR OWN CHART.

08:48.100 --> 08:49.833
WELL, I WANT TO FIND OUT
WHAT CAUSED ME

08:49.867 --> 08:52.067
TO SWERVE MY CAR
INTO ONCOMING TRAFFIC

08:52.067 --> 08:54.500
AND NOT BE ABLE
TO REMEMBER IT.

08:54.533 --> 08:55.733
HEY, THOSE PEOPLE,

08:55.767 --> 08:58.267
THE ONES I HIT,
THEY'RE GONNA BE OKAY, RIGHT?

08:58.300 --> 08:59.467
NO SERIOUS COMPLICATIONS?

08:59.500 --> 09:01.533
THEY'RE STILL CHECKIN'
'EM OUT.

09:02.733 --> 09:04.300
DR. TORRES.
YEAH.

09:04.333 --> 09:06.767
I WAS TOLD YOU'RE PERFORMING
THE NOAH REYNOLDS' SURGERY.

09:06.800 --> 09:07.867
YES.

09:07.900 --> 09:10.433
WELL, I'M YOUR INTERN.
SO WHENEVER YOU'RE READY...

09:10.467 --> 09:12.367
OKAY, WELL, HEAD UP
AND PREP THE O.R.

09:12.400 --> 09:15.167
I NEED TO PUT ON
A SPLINT.

09:18.367 --> 09:19.600
UM...

09:19.633 --> 09:21.533
DID YOU WASH YOUR HANDS?
WHAT?

09:21.567 --> 09:24.133
YOU WASHED YOUR HANDS, RIGHT?
OF COURSE I WASHED
MY HANDS.

09:24.167 --> 09:26.367
NO, NO, OF COURSE YOU DID.

09:26.400 --> 09:29.367
UH, MARSHALL, THIS IS GONNA HURT
A LITTLE BIT, OKAY?

09:29.400 --> 09:32.233
MY E.T.O.H. AND TOX SCREENS
WERE PRISTINE,

09:32.267 --> 09:34.167
SO I WASN'T DRINKING...
(joint cracks)

09:34.200 --> 09:36.467
OR UNDER THE INFLUENCE.
OW.

09:36.500 --> 09:39.067
OKAY, WE GET
THE C.T. RESULT BACK YET?

09:39.100 --> 09:40.467
NOT YET.

09:40.500 --> 09:42.667
MY G.C.S. WAS 13.
WHY HAVEN'T I HAD A C.T.?

09:42.700 --> 09:44.200
DR. GREY.

09:44.233 --> 09:47.800
C.T. WAS BACKED UP.
AND HE'S LUCID NOW, SO...

09:47.833 --> 09:49.333
SO GET IT DONE, NOW.

09:49.367 --> 09:50.500
(slams door)

09:50.533 --> 09:52.100
HEY.

09:52.133 --> 09:54.367
DAISY DUKE'S CASE
WAS BORING ME TO TEARS.

09:54.400 --> 09:57.567
SO, UM, YOU GOT ANY GOOD HEARTS
THAT I CAN CUT OPEN?

09:57.600 --> 10:02.100
OR, YOU KNOW, BAD HEARTS
THAT WE CAN MAKE GOOD?

10:06.500 --> 10:07.700
BURKE...

10:07.733 --> 10:10.233
USE WORDS.

10:14.200 --> 10:16.100
YOU FELL ASLEEP.

10:16.133 --> 10:17.833
WHEN?

10:17.867 --> 10:20.833
THIS MORNING
IN THE ON CALL ROOM.

10:20.867 --> 10:24.067
I FELL ASLEEP AFTER WE,
YOU KNOW.

10:24.100 --> 10:26.500
NOT AFTER. NOT AFTER.

10:26.533 --> 10:29.000
OH.

10:30.433 --> 10:33.467
OH, I-I'M... SORRY.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.233
I-I WAS REALLY TIR--

10:35.267 --> 10:37.167
SERIOUSLY, SERIOUSLY,
MY BAD.

10:37.200 --> 10:39.267
I'M REALLY SORRY.

10:39.300 --> 10:41.367
DON'T LET THIS THREATEN
YOUR MANHOOD OR ANY--

10:41.400 --> 10:43.667
OH, THIS IS NOT...

10:43.700 --> 10:46.033
I AM VERY CONFIDENT
IN MY MANHOOD.

10:46.067 --> 10:47.400
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

10:47.433 --> 10:50.733
WELL, GOOD, YOU SHOULD BE
BECAUSE, I MEAN...

10:50.767 --> 10:53.300
I FELL ASLEEP BECAUSE
I HAD ALREADY FINISHED.

10:53.333 --> 10:55.367
TWICE.

10:55.400 --> 10:58.333
I HADN'T FINISHED.

10:58.367 --> 11:00.367
I WAS TIRED.

11:00.400 --> 11:02.300
IT'S NOT LIKE I DID THIS
ON PURPOSE.

11:02.333 --> 11:04.233
OH, DID YOU STAY
IN THE HOSPITAL

11:04.267 --> 11:05.600
LAST NIGHT ON PURPOSE?

11:05.633 --> 11:07.533
BECAUSE YOU WEREN'T EVEN
ON CALL.

11:07.567 --> 11:09.467
IT WAS A PARAESOPHAGEAL HERNIA.
I HAD NEVER SEEN ONE.

11:09.500 --> 11:11.200
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M A SURGEON
FIRST, JUST LIKE YOU.

11:11.233 --> 11:14.800
NO, NO, NOT JUST LIKE ME.
I AM A PERSON FIRST.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.433
SOMEONE PAGED ME.

11:17.467 --> 11:18.667
DENNY!

11:18.700 --> 11:20.333
HE COLLAPSED.

11:20.367 --> 11:22.300
WHAT HAPPENED?

11:22.333 --> 11:23.533
TOO FAR, TOO FAST.

11:23.567 --> 11:25.200
WHAT WERE YOU DOING?

11:25.233 --> 11:26.300
STAIRS.

11:26.333 --> 11:27.700
REAL BRIGHT, HUH?

11:27.733 --> 11:29.633
OKAY, YOUR LVAD BATTERY
IS ALMOST DEAD.

11:29.667 --> 11:31.567
UM, GET HIM TO HIS ROOM.
I'LL GET DR. BURKE.

11:31.600 --> 11:33.067
OKAY, LET'S GET HIM UP.

11:33.100 --> 11:35.633
NICE AND EASY
ON ONE, TWO, THREE.

11:35.667 --> 11:38.467
DENNY, YOU KNEW THE LVAD
WASN'T A CURE.

11:38.500 --> 11:39.700
I WANT TO GO HOME.

11:39.733 --> 11:41.733
I WANT TO GO HOME YESTERDAY.

11:41.767 --> 11:44.567
I KNOW THIS IS HARD TO HEAR,
BUT THAT'S JUST NOT AN OPTION

11:44.600 --> 11:46.133
AT THIS POINT.

11:46.167 --> 11:48.067
SINCE WHEN
DO YOU GET TO DECIDE

11:48.100 --> 11:50.300
WHAT'S AN OPTION IN MY LIFE
AND WHAT ISN'T?

11:50.333 --> 11:52.300
MY HEART MAY BE ON
YOUR BATTERY PACKS,

11:52.333 --> 11:54.567
BUT IT'S STILL MY HEART.

11:54.600 --> 11:58.300
IT'S MY DECISION.
IT'S MY DAMN LIFE.

11:59.100 --> 12:02.067
THAT'S RIGHT.
IT IS YOUR LIFE.

12:02.067 --> 12:03.800
AND IT IS YOUR LIFE
THAT IS AT STAKE.

12:03.833 --> 12:05.733
AND IT IS YOUR LIFE
THAT WILL END

12:05.767 --> 12:07.667
IF YOU CONTINUE TO PUSH
LIKE YOU DID TODAY.

12:07.700 --> 12:10.133
YOU SAID THE LVAD
WOULD MAKE ME BETTER.

12:10.167 --> 12:12.433
I TOLD YOU THE LVAD
WOULD BUY YOU MORE TIME,

12:12.467 --> 12:14.067
AND IT WILL

12:14.100 --> 12:17.367
IF YOU RESPECT ITS LIMITATIONS
AND YOUR OWN.

12:18.833 --> 12:22.200
I WANNA GO HOME.

12:23.867 --> 12:26.533
WHAT DO WE DO?

12:26.567 --> 12:29.400
PUT HIM ON
A TIGHT LEASH.

12:29.433 --> 12:32.200
AND TELL THE NURSES
TO KEEP AN EYE ON HIM,

12:32.233 --> 12:34.567
MAKE SURE HE DOESN'T TAKE
ANY MORE ENDURANCE HIKES

12:34.600 --> 12:36.100
IN THE STAIRWELL.

12:36.133 --> 12:39.400
YEAH. BUT...

12:39.433 --> 12:41.167
PRESTON, WHAT DO WE DO?

12:41.200 --> 12:44.067
THE DAMAGE TO HIS BODY
WE CAN TRY TO CONTROL,

12:44.100 --> 12:47.133
BUT THE DAMAGE
TO HIS SPIRIT...

12:47.167 --> 12:49.633
FOR A MAN LIKE DENNY

12:49.667 --> 12:52.767
TO LIE ON THIS BED
FOR YEARS ON END?

12:52.800 --> 12:55.367
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING
WE COULD REALLY UNDERSTAND.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.633
AND HIS FEELINGS ABOUT IT

12:57.667 --> 13:01.400
AREN'T SOMETHING
WE SHOULD TRY TO CONTROL.

13:03.300 --> 13:04.800
GIVE HIM ROOM, IZZIE.

13:04.833 --> 13:08.067
JUST GIVE HIM ROOM
TO GRIEVE.

13:12.633 --> 13:15.500
(Cristina) YOU FINALLY GOT
MELANIE TO SHUT UP.

13:15.533 --> 13:17.433
FINALLY. THANKS FOR THAT,
BY THE WAY.
HOW'S SHE DOING?

13:17.467 --> 13:18.667
IMAGES COMING UP NOW.

13:18.700 --> 13:21.200
(Cristina) OH, IS THAT
A TEARDROP FRACTURE?

13:21.233 --> 13:23.533
YEAH, NO HEAD BLEED THOUGH.
THAT'S GOOD.

13:23.567 --> 13:26.400
LOOK AT HER LUNGS.
IS THAT HER LIVER?

13:26.433 --> 13:28.400
(man) WHOA.
(Cristina)
HOW IS SHE ALIVE?

13:28.433 --> 13:31.300
KAREV, PAGE SHEPHERD, BURKE,
MONTGOMERY-SHEPHERD, THE CHIEF

13:31.333 --> 13:33.233
AND EVERY SURGEON
WITH AN AVAILABLE HAND

13:33.267 --> 13:35.167
AND GET AN O.R. OPENED. GO!

13:35.200 --> 13:36.133
MELANIE. ME--

13:36.167 --> 13:37.667
(monitors beeping erratically)

13:37.700 --> 13:39.067
GET ME A STRETCHER

13:39.067 --> 13:40.800
AND LET'S PULL HER
OUTTA THERE NOW.

13:40.833 --> 13:42.733
(beeping continues)

13:42.767 --> 13:45.667
(Miranda) MELANIE.

13:52.133 --> 13:54.400
HEY.
HAVE YOU SEEN IZZIE?

13:54.433 --> 13:57.133
SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO PREP
AN O.R. FOR NOAH'S SURGERY,

13:57.167 --> 13:58.233
AND SHE COMPLETELY BAILED.

13:58.267 --> 13:59.367
WHAT?

14:00.767 --> 14:02.233
MR. AND MRS. JOHNSON.

14:02.267 --> 14:03.633
DR. O'MALLEY.

14:03.667 --> 14:05.633
OH! THAT LITTLE GIRL
RIGHT THERE SAYS

14:05.667 --> 14:08.467
SHE'S GONNA FIX NOAH'S LEG
ALL BY HERSELF.

14:08.500 --> 14:10.433
AND SHE JUST GAVE HIM
A BIG OL' SHOT FOR HIS PAIN.

14:10.467 --> 14:11.500
I REALLY LIKE HER.

14:11.533 --> 14:14.333
MR. AND MRS. JOHNSON.
BIG JIM.

14:14.367 --> 14:17.533
IT'S MELLIE.

14:19.767 --> 14:21.067
IS IT... MEL?

14:21.100 --> 14:22.633
(George)
YES, MA'AM, IT IS.

14:22.667 --> 14:23.800
WHAT? WHAT?

14:23.833 --> 14:25.733
WHEN YOUR DAUGHTER
CAME INTO THE E.R.

14:25.767 --> 14:28.600
HER BODY WAS OVER-PUMPING
HER BLOODSTREAM

14:28.633 --> 14:29.733
WITH ADRENALINE,

14:29.767 --> 14:32.667
WHICH KEPT HER CONSCIOUS
AND ALERT AND, UH, PAIN-FREE.

14:32.700 --> 14:34.267
DURING THE C.T. SCAN,

14:34.300 --> 14:36.200
SHE WAS LYING STILL FOR
AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME,

14:36.233 --> 14:37.200
AND SO HER BODY RELAXED

14:37.233 --> 14:39.267
AND THE ADRENALINE
STOPPED FLOWING, WHICH...

14:39.300 --> 14:41.100
ALLOWED HER TO SUCCUMB

14:41.133 --> 14:45.133
TO THE FULL EXTENT
OF HER INJURIES, WHICH...

14:45.167 --> 14:47.767
THEY'RE CATASTROPHIC.

14:47.800 --> 14:51.467
EXCUSE ME?

14:51.500 --> 14:54.500
(monitors beeping)

15:04.500 --> 15:07.167
GOOD. BOVIE.

15:07.200 --> 15:10.200
(speaking indistinctly)

15:10.233 --> 15:12.300
MORE SUCTION HERE.

15:12.333 --> 15:13.733
CLAMPS.

15:13.767 --> 15:16.500
INTERNAL SAW.

15:19.433 --> 15:21.333
KAREV, SIT DOWN.
I CAN'T SEE.

15:21.367 --> 15:23.333
THE ONLY THING
I WANT YOU TO DO

15:23.367 --> 15:25.267
IS SIT AT
THAT FETAL MONITOR

15:25.300 --> 15:26.500
AND WATCH
THAT BABY'S HEARTBEAT.

15:26.533 --> 15:28.233
SO NOW I'M A BABY-SITTER?

15:28.267 --> 15:31.567
(monitor beeping)

15:35.633 --> 15:36.767
RETRACTOR.

15:40.700 --> 15:43.567
(instrument buzzing)

15:43.600 --> 15:45.467
ADDISON,
WE'RE READY FOR YOU.

15:45.500 --> 15:48.700
WE ARE GOING TO DO
ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING WE CAN.

15:53.100 --> 15:55.467
UTERUS IS PROTECTED.
BABY'S HEARTBEAT?

15:55.500 --> 15:57.533
146.

15:59.100 --> 16:02.067
OKAY, THE BABY'S SAFE.
YOU CAN PROCEED WITH THE MOTHER.

16:02.100 --> 16:05.667
LUNGS ARE DAMAGED
PRETTY BADLY.

16:05.700 --> 16:06.533
(monitor beeping erratically)

16:06.567 --> 16:08.500
PRESSURE JUST BOTTOMED OUT.

16:08.533 --> 16:10.233
(Richard)
LET'S TRANSFUSE.

16:10.267 --> 16:11.733
(Miranda)
4-QUADRANT PACKING.

16:11.767 --> 16:13.667
COME ON, PEOPLE.
GET ME SOME LAP PADS.

16:13.700 --> 16:16.467
(Richard) CROSS-CLAMP
THE AORTA.
(Preston) CLAMP.
GOT IT.

16:16.500 --> 16:19.133
THERE'S TOO MUCH BLEEDING.
SHE'LL NEVER LAST. SHEPHERD?

16:19.167 --> 16:21.667
DAMAGE CONTROL.
(Richard) ADDISON?

16:21.700 --> 16:23.700
IF YOU WANT THE BABY
TO LIVE, DAMAGE CONTROL.

16:23.733 --> 16:24.633
BURKE?

16:24.667 --> 16:27.600
DAMAGE CONTROL.
EVERYONE KNOWS THE RULES--

16:27.633 --> 16:29.533
WE'RE GOING TO MOVE
AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE.

16:29.567 --> 16:30.533
DON'T WORRY ABOUT
FINISHING REPAIRS.

16:30.567 --> 16:32.500
FOR NOW, WE'RE ON
CRISIS MANAGEMENT, PEOPLE.

16:32.533 --> 16:34.200
JUST GET IT DONE.

16:34.233 --> 16:37.367
ONCE SHE REACHES THE TRIANGLE,
WE STOP, NO EXCEPTIONS.

16:37.400 --> 16:39.133
WHAT IS HE TALKING ABOUT,
"TRIANGLE"? WHAT TRIANGLE?

16:39.167 --> 16:41.067
BLOOD STOPS CLOTTING,
HER MUSCLES PRODUCE ACID

16:41.100 --> 16:42.433
AND HER ORGANS GET COLD.

16:42.467 --> 16:45.067
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
THE TRIANGLE OF DEATH.

16:49.600 --> 16:52.500
A RUPTURED ABDOMINAL
AORTIC ANEURYSM.

16:52.533 --> 16:53.567
WHAT?

16:53.600 --> 16:57.333
I SCRUBBED IN ON A--
AN ABDOMINAL AORTIC ANEURYSM.

16:57.367 --> 16:59.467
IT'S A 12-HOUR SURGERY.

16:59.500 --> 17:01.400
I'D ALREADY WORKED
30 HOURS, BUT I--

17:01.433 --> 17:03.333
I DIDN'T WANT TO MISS IT.

17:05.200 --> 17:08.167
I FELL ASLEEP FOR...
A SECOND BEHIND THE WHEEL.

17:08.200 --> 17:11.067
CLOSED MY EYES FOR A SECOND
AT THE RED LIGHT--

17:11.100 --> 17:12.667
A SECOND.

17:16.467 --> 17:19.367
IT WAS ONLY 12 HOURS.

17:19.400 --> 17:20.700
I'VE DONE IT BEFORE.

17:20.733 --> 17:23.167
WE'VE ALL DONE IT BEFORE.

17:23.200 --> 17:24.567
DR. GREY.

17:24.600 --> 17:25.533
MEREDITH.

17:25.567 --> 17:27.067
MEREDITH.

17:27.067 --> 17:31.067
DOES THIS MEAN, UH...

17:31.100 --> 17:34.067
ARE WE ACTUALLY SAYING
THAT, UH...

17:34.067 --> 17:37.300
TODAY, THIS MORNING,

17:37.333 --> 17:41.800
BECAUSE I STAYED IN THE O.R.
TO SAVE A LIFE...

17:41.833 --> 17:45.400
I MAY HAVE KILLED
A PREGNANT WOMAN?

17:45.433 --> 17:48.400
(woman) DR. GREY.

17:48.433 --> 17:50.467
YOU ORDERED A C.T.
ON MARSHALL STONE?

17:52.167 --> 17:54.100
WE'RE GONNA NEED
A MOMENT HERE.

17:54.133 --> 17:56.267
I'M BACKED UP HERE
WITH FIVE PATIENTS.

17:56.300 --> 17:59.767
WE NEED... A MOMENT.

17:59.800 --> 18:01.267
(woman) RADIOLOGY,
CALL E.R., STAT...

18:01.300 --> 18:03.633
MARSHALL?

18:03.667 --> 18:05.667
MARSHALL?

18:06.767 --> 18:08.433
IZZIE, PLEASE.

18:08.467 --> 18:09.633
COME ON, DENNY, JUST...
IZZIE.

18:09.667 --> 18:11.433
SMELL. SMELL.

18:11.467 --> 18:15.333
CHOCOLATE. AND NOT THE CRAPPY,
PROCESSED WAXY KIND,

18:15.367 --> 18:16.533
BUT THE REALLY GOOD
SWISS CHOCOLATE

18:16.567 --> 18:18.400
THAT YOU GET AT THE GIFT SHOP
THAT COSTS WAY TOO MUCH MONEY,

18:18.433 --> 18:20.133
BUT IS TOTALLY WORTH IT.

18:20.167 --> 18:21.433
TRY IT.

18:21.467 --> 18:24.600
AND EXHIBIT "B"--
TABLOIDS.

18:24.633 --> 18:26.533
GOOD, OLD-FASHIONED, TRASHY
CELEBRITY GOSSIP RAGS

18:26.567 --> 18:28.633
THAT ARE GUARANTEED TO TAKE
YOUR MIND OFF YOUR TROUBLES.

18:28.667 --> 18:30.133
DAMN IT, IZZIE,
STOP IT.

18:30.167 --> 18:33.467
JUST STOP IT.

18:33.500 --> 18:36.367
YOU THINK I'M FEELIN' SORRY
FOR MYSELF, RIGHT?

18:36.400 --> 18:39.100
POOR SAD-SACK DENNY JUST NEEDS
A LITTLE PERSPECTIVE.

18:39.133 --> 18:41.167
YOU DO NEED
A LITTLE PERSPECTIVE.

18:41.200 --> 18:42.500
YOU HAVE NO IDEA

18:42.533 --> 18:45.300
WHAT IS TO LOSE
WHAT I HAVE LOST.

18:45.333 --> 18:46.700
I KNOW LOSS, DENNY.

18:46.733 --> 18:49.067
NO, YOU DON'T!

18:50.267 --> 18:51.733
I'M A MAN.

18:51.767 --> 18:54.733
I'M A STRONG, VIRILE,
HORSE OF A MAN,

18:54.767 --> 18:57.500
STUCK IN THE BODY
OF SOME WEAK, SICK BASTARD

18:57.533 --> 19:00.433
THAT I DON'T KNOW, LIKE
OR RECOGNIZE.

19:00.467 --> 19:03.167
NOW IF YOU KNEW
WHAT THAT FEELS LIKE,

19:03.200 --> 19:04.367
YOU WOULD'VE NEVER
CONVINCED ME

19:04.400 --> 19:06.500
TO LET A BATTERY
RUN MY HEART.

19:06.533 --> 19:10.367
IF YOU KNEW
WHAT IT FEELS LIKE, IZZIE...

19:10.400 --> 19:13.133
YOU WOULDA LET ME GO.

19:15.767 --> 19:17.667
(man) SYSTOLIC'S 82, FOLKS.
IT'S NOT GETTING ANY BETTER.

19:17.700 --> 19:19.067
(Miranda) HOW'S THE SPLEEN,
CHIEF?

19:19.067 --> 19:20.767
(Richard) UNSALVAGEABLE,
I'M AFRAID.

19:20.800 --> 19:22.067
KAREV?

19:22.067 --> 19:24.700
FREQUENT DECELS
AND LOSS OF VARIABILITY.

19:24.733 --> 19:26.367
(Addison) THE BABY'S FADING.

19:26.400 --> 19:29.267
(man) pH IS DOWN 7.1.
CORE TEMP, 93 DEGREES.

19:29.300 --> 19:30.600
OKAY, WE'VE REACHED
THE TRIANGLE, PEOPLE.

19:30.633 --> 19:33.100
HANDS OUT.
(doctors all talking
at once)

19:33.133 --> 19:34.433
WE'RE NOT TRYING
FOR PERFECTION, PEOPLE.

19:34.467 --> 19:36.067
HANDS OUT.
JUST GIVE ME A SECOND,
PLEASE.

19:36.067 --> 19:38.067
DAMN IT, STOP.
EVERYBODY, STOP.

19:39.533 --> 19:42.600
CRISTINA.

19:45.100 --> 19:48.433
SLOW, ERRATIC,
BUT IT'S A HEARTBEAT.

19:48.467 --> 19:51.233
(Addison)
THE BABY'S HOLDING STEADY.

19:51.267 --> 19:52.267
BRING OUT THE PLASTIC.

19:52.300 --> 19:54.233
PLASTIC?
WE'RE NOT GONNA CLOSE?

19:54.267 --> 19:56.500
NO, WE'RE GONNA
KEEP HER OPEN,

19:56.533 --> 19:59.067
COVER HER WITH PLASTIC
AND GET HER TO THE I.C.U.

19:59.100 --> 20:02.100
(Alex) AND THEN WHAT?
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA SEE
IF SHE SURVIVES.

20:19.167 --> 20:20.833
(pager beeps)

20:20.867 --> 20:22.633
HOW IN THE HELL
DO YOU LET A PATIENT

20:22.667 --> 20:23.667
GET THAT FAR OFF YOUR WATCH?

20:23.700 --> 20:25.367
I TURNED MY BACK
FOR A SECOND.

20:25.400 --> 20:26.400
HE WAS IN THE DAMN GALLERY!

20:26.433 --> 20:28.500
HE'S A SURGICAL INTERN
AT MERCY WEST, AND HE--

20:28.533 --> 20:30.433
I DON'T CARE IF HE IS
THE SURGEON GENERAL.

20:30.467 --> 20:32.433
IN THIS HOSPITAL,
HE IS A PATIENT

20:32.467 --> 20:34.267
WITH A HEAD INJURY
WHO NEEDS A C.T.

20:34.300 --> 20:37.033
IN THIS HOSPITAL,
HE IS A SCARED GUY

20:37.067 --> 20:38.800
WHO DOES NOT NEED TO SEE
THE MASSIVE INTERNAL INJURIES

20:38.833 --> 20:41.567
OF THE WOMAN HE RAMMED
WITH HIS CAR!

20:41.600 --> 20:45.233
THIS IS YOUR FAULT.
YOU HAD HIM AND YOU LOST HIM.

20:45.267 --> 20:47.167
YOU GOTTA TAKE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR YOUR ACTIONS

20:47.200 --> 20:49.333
FOR ONCE IN YOUR LIFE.

20:49.367 --> 20:50.300
DEREK!

20:50.333 --> 20:53.333
***

21:01.667 --> 21:03.800
WE'VE GIVEN HER MEDICATIONS
TO HELP HER BLOOD CLOT

21:03.833 --> 21:06.100
AND TO HELP COUNTERACT
THE ACID BUILDUP.

21:06.133 --> 21:08.833
WE'RE SLOWLY RAISING
HER BODY TEMPERATURE

21:08.867 --> 21:11.367
WITH WARMING BLANKETS,
WARMED I.V. FLUIDS

21:11.400 --> 21:12.700
AND BLOOD PRODUCTS.

21:12.733 --> 21:16.233
HOW LONG IS SHE GONNA
HAVE TO BE LIKE THAT?

21:16.267 --> 21:19.267
YOU KNOW WITH...
OPEN LIKE THAT?

21:19.300 --> 21:21.767
WE WANT HER TO REGAIN
AS MUCH STRENGTH AS POSSIBLE

21:21.800 --> 21:23.700
BEFORE WE OPERATE AGAIN,
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,

21:23.733 --> 21:26.700
WE WANT TO REPAIR THE DAMAGE
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE,

21:26.733 --> 21:28.633
SO IT'S A BALANCING ACT.

21:28.667 --> 21:30.067
UH, I'M SORRY.

21:30.067 --> 21:32.533
I DON'T QUITE KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN.

21:32.567 --> 21:34.267
MELANIE WILL DIE

21:34.300 --> 21:36.400
IF WE DON'T GET HER BACK
TO SURGERY SOON ENOUGH,

21:36.433 --> 21:38.133
AND MELANIE WILL DIE

21:38.167 --> 21:40.233
IF WE TAKE HER BACK
TO SURGERY TOO SOON.

21:40.267 --> 21:43.267
(inhales)
A BALANCING ACT.

21:43.300 --> 21:46.067
A BALANCING ACT.

21:46.067 --> 21:49.200
***

21:52.500 --> 21:55.367
YANG, CALL ME IF SHE STARTS
ACTIVELY BLEEDING.

21:55.400 --> 21:57.633
OKAY.

21:57.667 --> 21:59.400
KAREV, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

21:59.433 --> 22:02.300
WHAT? SHE'S IN I.C.U.
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO.

22:02.333 --> 22:05.200
YOU CAN SIT THERE WITH HER
AND WATCH THAT FETAL MONITOR.

22:05.233 --> 22:07.300
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS?
SHE'S CIRCLING THE DRAIN.

22:07.333 --> 22:09.233
YOU KNOW HOW LONG
A BABY CAN SURVIVE

22:09.267 --> 22:10.800
INSIDE ITS DEAD MOTHER?

22:10.833 --> 22:13.700
FOUR TO FIVE MINUTES.
MINUTES, NOT SECONDS, KAREV.

22:13.733 --> 22:16.800
LOOK AT MELANIE. LOOK AT HER.
AND NOW LOOK AROUND.

22:16.833 --> 22:18.800
YOU SEE ALL THE DOCTORS
AND THE NURSES,

22:18.833 --> 22:20.500
EVEN HER PARENTS?

22:20.533 --> 22:22.433
THEIR SOLE JOB
IS TO TAKE CARE OF MELANIE.

22:22.467 --> 22:24.367
MY JOB
IS TO CARE FOR THAT BABY.

22:24.400 --> 22:26.300
NOW I'VE GOT
A SURGERY SCHEDULED,

22:26.333 --> 22:28.233
SO WHEN I STEP FOOT
ON THAT ELEVATOR AND LEAVE,

22:28.267 --> 22:30.400
YOU ARE GONNA BE THE ONLY PERSON
ON THIS ENTIRE FLOOR

22:30.433 --> 22:32.100
RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT BABY.

22:32.133 --> 22:34.367
DO NOT LET ME DOWN,
KAREV.

22:34.400 --> 22:36.767
***

22:36.800 --> 22:40.067
HER ORGANS ARE BLEEDING,
DAMAGED, EXPOSED

22:40.067 --> 22:41.600
AND COVERED IN PLASTIC WRAP.

22:41.633 --> 22:42.767
POOR MARSHALL.

22:42.800 --> 22:44.700
I MEAN, ONE MINUTE,
YOU'RE A SURGEON,

22:44.733 --> 22:46.633
THE NEXT, YOU'VE DESTROYED
AN ENTIRE FAMILY?

22:46.667 --> 22:50.133
LAST MONTH, I FELL ASLEEP
IN THE PARKING LOT ON A BENCH.

22:50.167 --> 22:52.067
I LITERALLY COULDN'T EVEN
MAKE IT TO MY CAR.

22:52.100 --> 22:53.533
I FELL ASLEEP
AT A RESTAURANT

22:53.567 --> 22:55.467
AT A TABLE
WHILE I WAS ON A DATE.

22:55.500 --> 22:57.433
YEAH, WELL, I FELL ASLEEP
DURING SEX.

22:57.467 --> 22:58.700
IZZIE.

22:58.733 --> 23:00.633
(lowered voice)
CALLIE'S LOOKING FOR YOU.

23:00.667 --> 23:01.833
YOU BLEW OFF HER SURGERY.

23:01.867 --> 23:04.500
NO, I-I HAD A PATIENT.
DENNY. I-I HAD TO GO.

23:04.533 --> 23:06.433
YOU WERE HANGING OUT
WITH DENNY?

23:06.467 --> 23:08.367
OH, PLEASE, DO NOT EVEN
TALK TO ME ABOUT STANDARDS.

23:08.400 --> 23:10.300
THE GIRL CAN'T EVEN
WASH HER HANDS.

23:10.333 --> 23:11.533
(Meredith laughs)

23:15.433 --> 23:17.367
DON'T WORRY ABOUT BAMBI.

23:17.400 --> 23:19.400
IF BURKE CAN FORGIVE ME
FOR FALLING ASLEEP DURING SEX,

23:19.433 --> 23:21.333
THEN GEORGE CAN FORGIVE YOU
FOR CRYING.

23:21.367 --> 23:24.133
BUT BURKE
HASN'T FORGIVEN YOU.

23:33.067 --> 23:36.667
I FOUND IZZIE.
SHE SAID SHE HAD A PATIENT.

23:40.267 --> 23:42.100
I KNEW YOU'D TAKE
HER SIDE.

23:42.133 --> 23:43.067
WHAT?

23:43.100 --> 23:44.067
(sighs)

23:44.067 --> 23:45.233
HE NEEDS AN I.V.

23:45.267 --> 23:47.067
ARE YOU...

23:48.267 --> 23:50.633
SHE'S MAD AT YOU.

23:50.667 --> 23:53.133
I-I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE AWAKE.

23:53.167 --> 23:55.500
WHAT'D YOU DO?

23:55.533 --> 23:57.500
UH, HAS...
HAS ANYONE TALKED TO YOU

23:57.533 --> 23:59.733
ABOUT YOUR WIFE,
ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING?

24:02.300 --> 24:04.167
"WHAT'S HAPPENING"?
UH...

24:04.200 --> 24:07.700
YEAH, YOU KNOW I CAN'T REALLY,
UH, WRAP MY BRAIN

24:07.733 --> 24:09.833
AROUND WHAT'S HAPPENING.

24:09.867 --> 24:11.833
YOU KNOW,
I'M--I'M FROM HERE.

24:11.867 --> 24:13.833
UH... SEATTLE.

24:13.867 --> 24:17.433
AND, UH, YOU KNOW,
I GO AWAY TO COLLEGE,

24:17.467 --> 24:21.433
AND I COME BACK
MARRIED TO THIS BIG-HAIRED,

24:21.467 --> 24:25.300
DRAWLIN' SOUTHERN GIRL.

24:25.333 --> 24:27.433
AND EVERYONE I KNOW
THINKS I'M CRAZY,

24:27.467 --> 24:30.100
BUT I LOVE HER.

24:30.133 --> 24:32.433
AND I JUST...

24:32.467 --> 24:35.700
I LOVE HER.

24:35.733 --> 24:37.300
AND, UH...

24:37.333 --> 24:39.500
WHAT'S HAPPENING

24:39.533 --> 24:42.067
IS THAT MY...

24:42.100 --> 24:45.500
BIG-HAIRED, SOUTHERN GIRL

24:45.533 --> 24:46.733
COULD BE DYING.

24:46.767 --> 24:50.500
AND...
I CAN'T THINK ABOUT THAT.

24:50.533 --> 24:52.233
YOU KNOW, I NEED TO--

24:52.267 --> 24:54.167
I NEED TO THINK
ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE,

24:54.200 --> 24:56.100
SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T MATTER
SO MUCH,

24:56.133 --> 24:59.800
SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T--
DOESN'T HAVE ME BURYING

24:59.833 --> 25:06.067
MY 22-YEAR-OLD WIFE
AND BABY.

25:07.600 --> 25:10.367
SO, UH, SO...

25:10.400 --> 25:12.667
WHAT THE HELL DID YOU DO?
(chuckles)

25:14.633 --> 25:16.533
I BELIEVED MY FRIEND
WHEN SHE TOLD ME

25:16.567 --> 25:19.267
THAT DR. TORRES
DOESN'T WASH HER HANDS.

25:22.067 --> 25:25.067
WELL, I HOPE
THAT'S NOT TRUE,

25:25.067 --> 25:26.567
SEEING AS SHE JUST, UH,

25:26.600 --> 25:29.133
PERFORMED SURGERY ON ME
AND ALL.

25:29.167 --> 25:30.100
YEAH.

25:30.133 --> 25:31.067
YEAH.

25:31.100 --> 25:32.767
YOU PAGED ME?

25:32.800 --> 25:34.433
C.T. RESULTS.

25:34.467 --> 25:36.433
GOOD. THANK YOU.

25:36.467 --> 25:38.600
ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE
WHAT WE GOT HERE.

25:40.400 --> 25:42.400
MARSHALL,
EVERYTHING CHECKS OUT FINE.

25:42.433 --> 25:45.333
THE SHORT-TERM MEMORY LOSS WAS
A RESULT FROM THE CONCUSSION.

25:45.367 --> 25:47.800
TO BE SAFE, I WANT TO
KEEP YOU HERE OVERNIGHT

25:47.833 --> 25:49.200
FOR OBSERVATION, ALL RIGHT?

25:49.233 --> 25:51.667
I HAVE TO APOLOGIZE.

25:51.700 --> 25:52.833
WHAT?

25:52.867 --> 25:55.667
TO THE WOMAN'S FAMILY.

25:55.700 --> 25:58.767
I HAVE TO TELL THEM
I'M SORRY FOR WHAT I DID.

26:00.533 --> 26:03.400
YOU SHOULD GET SOME REST.

26:11.667 --> 26:14.667
I NEVER SHOULD'VE TOLD YOU
ABOUT GEORGE.

26:14.700 --> 26:16.600
NO, IT'S FINE.
I'M GLAD I KNOW...

26:16.633 --> 26:17.767
ABOUT HIM AND THE VET.

26:17.800 --> 26:19.433
YOU REALLY GET AROUND.

26:19.467 --> 26:21.733
WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY TO ME?
IT'S UNFORGIVABLE.

26:21.767 --> 26:24.400
I DON'T REMEMBER
EVER ASKING YOU TO FORGIVE ME.

26:24.433 --> 26:27.233
SO WAS THE KNITTING A PHASE?
WHO'S NEXT--ALEX?

26:27.267 --> 26:30.167
'CAUSE I HEAR HE LIKES
TO SLEEP AROUND.

26:30.200 --> 26:33.700
YOU TWO HAVE THAT
IN COMMON.

26:33.733 --> 26:35.767
YOU DON'T GET
TO CALL ME A WHORE.

26:35.800 --> 26:38.667
WHEN I MET YOU, I THOUGHT
I HAD FOUND THE PERSON

26:38.700 --> 26:41.567
THAT I WAS GOING TO SPEND
THE REST OF MY LIFE WITH.

26:41.600 --> 26:43.067
I WAS DONE.

26:43.100 --> 26:44.833
SO ALL THE BOYS
AND ALL THE BARS

26:44.867 --> 26:47.167
AND ALL THE OBVIOUS
DADDY ISSUES--WHO CARED?

26:47.200 --> 26:48.500
BECAUSE I WAS DONE.

26:48.533 --> 26:51.167
YOU LEFT ME.

26:51.200 --> 26:53.067
YOU CHOSE ADDISON.

26:53.100 --> 26:55.467
I'M ALL GLUED
BACK TOGETHER NOW.

26:55.500 --> 26:59.267
I MAKE NO APOLOGIES
FOR HOW I CHOSE TO REPAIR

26:59.300 --> 27:00.767
WHAT YOU BROKE.

27:00.800 --> 27:03.700
YOU DON'T GET
TO CALL ME A WHORE.

27:09.833 --> 27:11.733
THIS THING WITH US
IS FINISHED.

27:11.767 --> 27:13.600
IT'S OVER.

27:13.633 --> 27:15.600
FINALLY.

27:15.633 --> 27:17.133
YEAH. IT'S DONE.

27:17.167 --> 27:19.233
IT IS DONE.

27:34.800 --> 27:36.300
HER TEMPERATURE
IS 95.4 DEGREES.

27:36.333 --> 27:38.667
AND HER pH IS 7.28.

27:41.100 --> 27:42.433
DEFINITELY CLOTTING BETTER.

27:42.467 --> 27:43.667
MM-HMM.

27:43.700 --> 27:45.833
BUT SOME OF THE WOUNDS
ARE STILL OOZING.

27:45.867 --> 27:48.700
STILL A FINE LINE.

27:48.733 --> 27:51.600
(Richard) SHE MAY NOT BE
QUITE STABLE ENOUGH.

27:51.633 --> 27:53.533
Y'ALL DON'T HAVE TO WHISPER.

27:53.567 --> 27:56.167
I'M SITTING RIGHT HERE.
I CAN HEAR YOU ANYWAY.

27:57.733 --> 28:00.067
AND SHE'S MY BABY.

28:00.100 --> 28:01.833
SHE'S MY LITTLE GIRL.

28:01.867 --> 28:04.700
IT'S A BIG DECISION LIKE THIS,

28:04.733 --> 28:10.700
UH, GOIN' BACK IN
AND SEWING UP HER... ORGANS.

28:10.733 --> 28:12.233
IT'S THE KIND OF DECISION

28:12.267 --> 28:15.133
THAT A MAMA
OUGHTA BE INVOLVED IN.

28:15.167 --> 28:19.267
I MEAN, ALL HER LIFE,
SHE'S ASKED ME EVERYTHING...

28:19.300 --> 28:22.667
FROM... WHAT COLOR DRESS
SHE OUGHTA WEAR

SHE'LL GO INTO
MULTIPLE ORGAN FAILURE.

29:02.167 --> 29:03.400
OKAY.
