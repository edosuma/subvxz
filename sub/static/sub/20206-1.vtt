Subtitles by Renatinha Tankinha

00:27.804 --> 00:32.433
2015 Scientists perform
genetic modification of embryos.

00:36.187 --> 00:38.303
2020 Genetic modifications of humans have
become commercial. Genetically modified

00:38.327 --> 00:40.892
babies have a higher IQ, ideal physical
characteristics and positive personalities.

00:40.916 --> 00:43.280
Genetically engineered
babies have higher

00:43.305 --> 00:46.644
IQ, better physics
and even tempered.

00:56.199 --> 00:58.359
2038 The process has a
success rate of 97%,

00:58.384 --> 01:01.770
while the first generation of genetic
modified people is growing up.

01:01.795 --> 01:04.129
These "perfect" specimens
are referred to as GC people,

01:04.154 --> 01:08.511
named after the company that
invented the method, GLEN CREST LABS.

01:08.595 --> 01:14.017
2047 GC people regain space.

01:14.100 --> 01:16.744
Space exploration has become
indispensable to find a

01:16.769 --> 01:19.463
solution to the deterioration
of the Earth's climate.

02:32.929 --> 02:36.100
-LECP dynamic monitoring. Online.

02:36.211 --> 02:38.667
- Rendezvous with the Atromitos
should appear shortly.

02:38.825 --> 02:42.082
- We have a welcome message from
Nordham sent the day we left.

02:44.899 --> 02:46.159
<i>-Greetings from Earth.</i>

02:47.844 --> 02:49.170
<i>Where I am now years older,</i>

02:49.931 --> 02:52.375
<i>but you're feeling like not
even a day has passed.</i>

02:53.491 --> 02:57.495
<i>I have no doubt that you are going
to be successful in recovering the cargo.</i>

02:57.579 --> 03:00.876
<i>And I will send live
transmissions after your arrival.</i>

03:01.458 --> 03:05.570
- It makes you feel all warm and fuzzy.
- Anything besides obligatory sentiments?

03:06.463 --> 03:08.626
- Data files from the last
three years are downloading.

03:08.651 --> 03:11.321
<i>-Detecting elevated
levels of methane gas.</i>

03:11.346 --> 03:12.955
-Lots of seismic
activity on Titan.

03:13.337 --> 03:16.661
Fire all cannon eruption.
- Shouldn't impact our mission in orbit.

03:17.349 --> 03:19.609
- In visual range
of the Atromitos.

03:19.726 --> 03:23.787
<i>-Current speed: 445 km/h.</i>

03:24.606 --> 03:27.330
<i>Twelve degrees elliptical LTO.</i>

03:31.696 --> 03:36.099
- Something's wrong. The Atromitos is
drifted too close to Titan's atmosphere.

03:36.868 --> 03:40.371
- Duncan, close the gap, quickly.
- Their hull is going to rupture.

03:40.455 --> 03:43.180
- Anderson, can you access
the ship's mainframe?

03:43.227 --> 03:45.256
-I've been trying. No response.

03:45.293 --> 03:48.463
- Zimmer, ready to align.
- Atromitos is ten times our mass.

03:48.546 --> 03:51.758
We'll have to engage kill thrusters
simultaneously or we could get pulled in.

03:51.841 --> 03:53.608
- The thrusters will
have to be recalibrated

03:53.633 --> 03:55.991
in order to compensate
for atmospheric drag.

03:56.015 --> 03:57.256
-Already on it.

04:10.693 --> 04:13.822
- We've matched position
and velocity of the Atromitos.

04:13.905 --> 04:16.394
- Maintain speed, compensate
for any variants.

04:16.420 --> 04:18.276
-Tow line and kill thrusters ready.

04:18.300 --> 04:19.345
-Go ahead.

04:29.796 --> 04:32.311
- The Atromitos' rotation
system's creating reverse pull.

04:32.336 --> 04:34.116
- Danger. Atmosphere entry in the...

04:34.175 --> 04:37.053
- Bypass the ship's mainframe.
- Access its own control.

04:37.077 --> 04:38.470
- I tried that.
<i>- 2%.</i>

04:38.471 --> 04:40.992
You've got about 40 seconds
before we lose Atromitos.

04:41.017 --> 04:44.042
- And in 20 seconds we will be
pulled into the atmosphere also.

04:44.102 --> 04:49.065
- We will not lose Atromitos. Ideas?
- I have a work around.

04:49.149 --> 04:51.132
If I clone the internal
protocols it should react as

04:51.156 --> 04:53.077
though the communes are
coming from inside the ship/.

04:53.101 --> 04:56.243
- Warning, Call integrity. Critical.
- Five seconds.

04:56.268 --> 04:57.327
-Got it.

05:01.911 --> 05:03.372
-Increase kill thrusters.

05:05.290 --> 05:07.348
-The magnetic tow line is holding.

05:10.795 --> 05:12.247
Atromitos is lifting.

05:16.134 --> 05:17.272
We're in the clear.

05:20.472 --> 05:23.808
- Stop touching. You're
confusing the bio signs.

05:23.892 --> 05:26.511
- Excuse our unbridled
celebratory act, doc.

05:27.456 --> 05:31.298
- Your increased adrenaline levels so
soon after stasis can be dangerous.

05:31.349 --> 05:32.910
-What increased
adrenaline levels?

05:32.935 --> 05:33.934
-I have no idea what he's
talking about, either.

05:33.959 --> 05:35.169
<i>-Hello and...</i>

05:36.237 --> 05:38.723
- Get back to work.
- A little communication would be nice.

05:38.801 --> 05:40.148
Video signal unavailable.

05:40.173 --> 05:43.005
- Sorry, sir, we had to
momentarily divert power.

05:43.029 --> 05:45.971
- Audio is working, but outgoing
visual signal will be a bit longer.

05:46.122 --> 05:50.171
- I don't need to see you, Linden.
I already know what you all look like.

05:50.877 --> 05:53.254
-Transferring data to main screen.

05:53.338 --> 05:57.281
- Still nothing from the Atromitos.
Three months since the last transmission.

05:57.717 --> 06:00.285
We've concluded that all
of the crew are dead.

06:00.577 --> 06:04.131
Respectfully, sir, seems overkill
to send us on a rescue operation.

06:04.224 --> 06:09.020
- I would agree if it were not for
the importance of cargo on the Atromitos.

06:09.104 --> 06:14.734
A substance that took the crew two years
to extract and to refine our type.

06:15.095 --> 06:17.931
A carbon fixing catalyst
that will repair our

06:17.943 --> 06:20.544
atmosphere. We have
the opportunity to...

06:21.783 --> 06:22.951
-What?

06:26.871 --> 06:31.626
Why isn't it possible to program a robot
to be less socially inept?

06:31.709 --> 06:34.629
- The preferred term is ART
for artificial human, sir.

06:35.404 --> 06:40.427
- I find the need to show cultural
sensitivity to a machine beyond stupid.

06:46.224 --> 06:49.325
Where was I?
- Atmosphere appearing compound.

06:49.603 --> 06:50.603
-Right.

06:51.563 --> 06:56.359
Recover the cargo. This mission is
vital. We're counting on you.

06:56.443 --> 06:58.931
- We'll get it done.
- I know you will.

06:59.779 --> 07:04.634
Deep space travel is not for my kind.
Too much time out there and we go mad.

07:05.410 --> 07:08.362
Is that what happened
to the Atromitos crew?

07:08.374 --> 07:10.707
I'm not sure. But
it's a safe bet.

07:10.790 --> 07:15.086
- Well, success is our only option.
- I would expect nothing less.

07:15.462 --> 07:19.132
-Atromitos captain's log, 12-20-66.

07:19.215 --> 07:22.223
- The crew has been working hard
these last couple of weeks.

07:22.248 --> 07:25.204
The compound has been harvested,
it's ready for transport.

07:25.263 --> 07:29.174
They're only 26 days
behind schedule which is

07:29.838 --> 07:32.711
not bad, considering all
of the earlier delays.

07:32.771 --> 07:36.775
Once the crew quarantine
we are ready to go.

07:36.858 --> 07:39.366
- What business does it
make to some people like us

07:39.378 --> 07:41.946
to keep fixing what these
preemies keep screwing up?

07:43.073 --> 07:46.488
- I know I didn't just hear the word
"preemie" to describe non GC human.

07:47.230 --> 07:48.644
-I meant it???

07:48.828 --> 07:51.331
- Orson has a point. It does
seem our mission always

07:51.343 --> 07:54.000
consist of cleaning up messes
caused by regular humans.

07:54.537 --> 07:59.631
- Speaking of cleaning up. the Atromitos
is equipped with an ART, 320 model.

08:00.014 --> 08:04.769
- Assuming Lulu still functions, she'll be
doing domestic duties after we board.

08:04.794 --> 08:08.332
We may also need to access her memory
to find out what happened on the ship.

08:08.723 --> 08:13.645
- Oxygen levels on the Atromitos are good,
life support is still functioning also.

08:16.272 --> 08:19.039
There's an odd noise
coming from inside the ship.

08:19.051 --> 08:19.977
What is that?

08:21.528 --> 08:25.949
- It sounds like a death metal
band called GWAR from the 1990s.

08:26.032 --> 08:31.284
- Do you listen to death metal?
- Technically, it's classic rock.

08:33.539 --> 08:40.630
- The situation grows worse by the hour, I
fear it will lead to violent confrontation.

08:43.750 --> 08:46.720
It's inconceivable to think
that mutiny could occur on

08:46.732 --> 08:49.714
a space vessel where life is
so fragile to begin with.

08:49.806 --> 08:53.532
But there's no other word
to describe it.

09:03.820 --> 09:06.364
<i>-Boarding procedure enacted.</i>

09:12.120 --> 09:16.979
- Inter system configuration has changed.
- Code not recognized.

09:17.500 --> 09:18.894
-Overriding.

09:49.324 --> 09:52.535
- Lower the volume!
- The voice command is not working.

09:52.619 --> 09:56.706
- I need to get close to
the main control server to fix it.

10:01.628 --> 10:04.700
Improvised device of some kind.
Keep your eyes open.

10:45.964 --> 10:48.536
The black box has been forcibly removed.

10:54.848 --> 10:58.570
Greenhouse plants are overgrown
It's a jungle in here.

11:07.152 --> 11:10.363
- Thank you, Zimmer.
- You're welcome.

11:31.259 --> 11:32.710
-Controlled and clear.

11:39.642 --> 11:43.006
- I've found the ship's ART.
Is your name Lulu?

11:48.276 --> 11:50.990
- Yes.
- Is there anyone else on board?

11:52.113 --> 11:53.378
- Yes.
- Who?

11:53.403 --> 11:57.628
- Crew member Travis O'Neill.
- We have a survivor. Travis O'Neill.

11:59.079 --> 12:02.707
- Where is Travis O'Neill?
- I don't know.

12:27.023 --> 12:30.610
- Target lock engaged.
- I've found O'Neill.

12:33.696 --> 12:36.383
Crew quarter's hallway.

12:37.409 --> 12:40.264
Zimmer, I need an override for room G
at the crew section.

12:40.912 --> 12:45.208
- Ready when you are.
- Go ahead.

12:52.090 --> 12:53.300
-Travis O'Neill?

12:55.691 --> 12:56.738
Turn around.

13:18.992 --> 13:21.052
-The cargo container isn't here.

13:21.995 --> 13:25.206
- All communication systems have to be
reprogrammed at the root level.???

13:25.290 --> 13:29.345
- Uncluttered operations could take even
longer. I can piece override individual

13:29.357 --> 13:33.173
functions, but getting this ship fully
operational? It would be a while.???

13:33.256 --> 13:35.315
- Carry on with that, , but
our objective is to find

13:35.327 --> 13:37.319
the cargo, so that should
be our primary function.

13:37.343 --> 13:40.314
-The cargo tracking system is disabled.

13:40.805 --> 13:44.370
Scans found no signs of the
cargo nor from our crew. the

13:44.382 --> 13:47.896
only DNA still present belong
to O'Neill or the plants.

13:47.979 --> 13:51.828
- What can you tell us about him?
- Ship's junior engineer.

13:52.400 --> 13:55.408
Nothing particularly
ordinary about him. No

13:55.420 --> 13:58.990
military training, academic
record nothing special.

13:59.210 --> 14:00.330
<i>-Travis O'Neill... engineer.</i>

14:00.617 --> 14:01.998
-He's a John Doe,

14:14.764 --> 14:17.201
- There are some nutritional
deficiencies, looks

14:17.213 --> 14:19.811
like he hasn't slept in a
while, but nothing major.

14:20.172 --> 14:25.810
Hygiene hasn't built in. so I had the
ART shave his hair and give him a bath.

14:26.976 --> 14:28.696
Mentally?

14:28.708 --> 14:33.905
You pick it. PTSD, depression,
depersonalization disorder.

14:34.567 --> 14:36.429
Hard to say at this point.

14:45.995 --> 14:50.417
- Hello, O'Neill. I am Reginald
Linden, captain of the Teleios.

14:50.500 --> 14:52.039
We were sent here on a rescue mission.

14:54.963 --> 14:57.257
Any help you could give
us would be appreciated.

15:03.263 --> 15:05.864
- We're putting you in charge of
getting information from O'Neill.

15:06.936 --> 15:08.247
-Why me?

15:08.685 --> 15:11.396
-You have a PhD in psychology.

15:11.479 --> 15:13.821
- Come on, that was
just something I did to

15:13.833 --> 15:16.295
take my mind off my
Cauchy Kowalevski-thesis.

15:16.860 --> 15:20.155
- Congratulations. You are still the
more qualified than anyone else.

15:21.573 --> 15:25.014
- What about the ART? Have you
accessed their memory banks?

15:25.452 --> 15:28.478
- Like the ship, Lulu's
memory has been wiped clean.

15:31.916 --> 15:34.308
Since we're gonna be
here for a while can we

15:34.320 --> 15:36.670
not do something about
these fucking weeds?

15:37.172 --> 15:40.717
- I recommend transferring O'Neill
to the recreation room.

15:40.800 --> 15:43.050
There is only one way in or
out of the room, but it is

15:43.062 --> 15:45.242
a larger space and doesn't
feel like he's in prison.

15:46.020 --> 15:47.020
-That's fine.

15:47.474 --> 15:49.442
- I hope you had a good sleep.
Have you been

15:49.454 --> 15:51.478
able to establish contact
with the Atromitos?

15:51.561 --> 15:54.004
"Please let us know the
status of the cargo."

15:55.140 --> 15:57.666
After three years, that's
all it could come up with?

15:57.691 --> 16:00.371
- Um-hum. I guess We'll
just have to figure out how

16:00.383 --> 16:02.971
to make the most of being
stuck here for a while.

16:07.327 --> 16:08.808
-I guess we will.

16:24.761 --> 16:29.209
- My father always said it was a waste
of time to take a second PhD.

16:30.934 --> 16:33.805
In psychology, of all things.

16:38.024 --> 16:44.322
Now and, not in none of my years of study
did we discuss the mental effects off

16:44.406 --> 16:51.246
deep space isolation
following a traumatizing event.

17:00.630 --> 17:06.250
Whatever it was that happened,
it must have been terrible.

17:06.928 --> 17:14.602
So many people that you knew, I'm sure
you developed some good friendships.

17:16.229 --> 17:21.150
And I can't even imagine what it must
have been like to be alone for so long,

17:21.901 --> 17:24.642
with only Lulu as your companion.

17:34.414 --> 17:37.598
No reaction to talking
about the ship, the crew,

17:37.610 --> 17:40.545
or the cargo or even his
past or his family.

17:40.628 --> 17:45.117
One thing did get a slight
reaction, though. - What?

17:47.761 --> 17:50.319
-Lulu, go to the crew's quarter wing.

18:00.231 --> 18:02.900
- It's not uncommon for
non-GC humans to develop

18:02.912 --> 18:05.320
emotional attachments
to artificial humans.

18:05.403 --> 18:07.178
The same way that they do with pets.

18:08.045 --> 18:13.550
This bond is even stronger if
ART has sexual characteristics.

18:13.620 --> 18:17.327
- ARTs are born space vessels,
wouldn't be equipped with genitals.

18:17.791 --> 18:21.455
- O'Neill is an engineer, he's had
three years to tinker.

18:22.087 --> 18:23.210
-That'd be you.

18:27.842 --> 18:29.129
-Printing complete.

18:34.599 --> 18:38.103
-Lulu. Remove your pants.

18:44.651 --> 18:47.781
Apparently O'Neill also likes pubic hair.

18:48.822 --> 18:52.108
- Not necessary to
know all the details, Orson.

18:53.326 --> 18:54.631
-How should we use her?

18:56.579 --> 19:01.209
Allow O'Neill to be with her from time to
time. I want to see if his behavior changes

19:01.292 --> 19:03.586
when she's near him,
versus when she's not.

19:03.670 --> 19:05.527
Wouldn't deprivation work?

19:05.539 --> 19:09.879
By dangling a carrot, we can...
withdrew it whenever we want.

19:10.468 --> 19:12.443
Giving us
more psychological control.

19:17.392 --> 19:23.148
<i>-Oxygen level's 21%, nitrogen, 78%.</i>

19:23.231 --> 19:25.356
- Was that you?
- Negative.

19:26.109 --> 19:29.680
- This is Anderson. Can anyone hear me?
- Linden here. What's going on.

19:30.111 --> 19:31.311
-Trying to fix it.

19:31.364 --> 19:32.588
Duncan, can you hear me?

19:32.600 --> 19:35.121
I'm in the hallway 3
heading to the rec room now.

19:38.712 --> 19:42.955
- O'Neill's escaped.
- Orson, is the path to to Teleios secured?

19:44.210 --> 19:47.518
- Only voice or hand-print
recognition from one of us will open it.

19:54.010 --> 19:57.265
-He has taken the pulse rifle, though.

19:57.348 --> 20:00.266
- I'm headed to cargo bay
Duncan, check the machine room.

20:04.314 --> 20:07.182
- Machine room is secure.
I am in the cargo bay wing now.

20:46.189 --> 20:47.410
What do you want?

20:48.566 --> 20:50.797
Do you want us to get off the ship?

21:05.041 --> 21:08.611
Do you have something
you... want to tell me?

21:12.424 --> 21:15.907
- Put it down, O'Neil.
- I have this handled.

21:15.932 --> 21:19.936
- O'Neill, our kind treatment
is by virtue of our good disposition.

21:23.017 --> 21:25.980
Make no mistake, though.
Our patience is not limitless.

21:27.063 --> 21:29.718
Go on, pull the trigger.
- What are you doing?

21:30.096 --> 21:30.941
Do it, O'Neil.

21:30.953 --> 21:33.471
The rifles have a
fingerprint lock on them.

21:36.213 --> 21:38.390
Nothing will happen.

21:45.665 --> 21:48.698
- I like this lighting.
I think it is soothing.

21:49.252 --> 21:51.272
- Unless you need to see
what the hell you're doing

21:55.842 --> 21:57.998
it's acceding the video
entertainment files.

21:59.596 --> 22:01.121
-What is this?

22:03.975 --> 22:05.844
- Before aggression,
inhibitors were mandatory.

22:05.856 --> 22:07.815
Decommissioned ARTs ended
up on the black market-

22:07.899 --> 22:09.865
and were reprogrammed as fighting bots.

22:11.608 --> 22:13.974
Who watches this
kind of thing?

22:13.986 --> 22:18.323
Regular humans still have a
primitive craving for violence.

22:19.616 --> 22:22.471
- It's no wonder the crew went
mad watching stuff like this.

22:23.073 --> 22:24.606
-They're just machines.

22:29.709 --> 22:31.286
-Can you turn it off?

22:43.098 --> 22:45.655
- O'Neill is more lucid
than he's been letting on.

22:46.768 --> 22:51.272
- What were you doing in there?
- What were <i>you</i> doing in there?

22:51.684 --> 22:56.753
You knew he could harm you. - I was trying
to get him to talk. And he almost did.

22:56.778 --> 23:02.158
- I feel like we're being played.
- You wanted me to handle this. Let me.

23:02.242 --> 23:04.000
-Make him talk.

23:07.330 --> 23:11.192
- Did temperature gauge get reset in
here also? It's boiling in here.

23:19.926 --> 23:20.957
-What?

23:24.347 --> 23:27.566
- Thank God!
- No, thank Zimmer.

23:28.059 --> 23:30.476
-One in the same thing, in Zimmer's mind.

23:31.855 --> 23:34.183
- Glad to see we're back at
the starting line again.

23:34.631 --> 23:35.709
-You're welcome.

23:36.484 --> 23:38.793
Can we expect any
more disturbances?

23:38.805 --> 23:42.615
I should have the main system
debugged by the end of the day.

23:43.295 --> 23:45.137
Make contact with
Earth base yet?

23:45.149 --> 23:47.982
Just data transmissions,
no video link, yet, though.

23:48.800 --> 23:49.925
-Let's try again.

24:25.200 --> 24:29.852
- We received your transmission.
I want you to reiterate the mission.

24:30.914 --> 24:35.418
To retrieve and to return the cargo.
This is a top priority.

24:35.502 --> 24:41.116
Everything else is secondary.
I repeat: everything else is secondary.

24:41.800 --> 24:43.592
Thank you and good luck.

24:45.428 --> 24:48.483
- That's it?
- Yep.

24:53.937 --> 24:59.723
- In the cargo bay, I asked if you
wanted to tell me something.

25:01.152 --> 25:03.289
You almost answered.

25:07.325 --> 25:09.634
Artists do what they do
for different reasons.

25:11.528 --> 25:16.219
But most will tell you that they create in
order to reveal something about themselves.

25:18.086 --> 25:21.725
About the world, that
they observe, or both.

25:23.429 --> 25:28.401
In your paintings, I see serenity
on one side, and chaos on another.

25:30.056 --> 25:34.771
The question is not why
you made these creations-

25:35.895 --> 25:39.482
-but for whom.

26:00.420 --> 26:03.673
-Recreation Room, camera A.

27:19.416 --> 27:24.313
- What’s wrong, Orson?
- I forgot why I came here.

27:24.796 --> 27:28.747
- Forgot? When was the last time
you forgot anything?

27:30.343 --> 27:33.476
- The irony is I don't even remember
the last time I forgot something.

27:34.472 --> 27:36.513
-You know Mandarin, right?

27:42.772 --> 27:44.068
What do you make of this?

27:53.032 --> 27:54.430
-Unable.

27:55.243 --> 27:57.461
Belief. Near.

27:58.747 --> 28:01.761
It's... it's gargled,
but where'd you get it?

28:01.773 --> 28:04.043
O'Neill. he
whispered it to Lulu.

28:04.127 --> 28:07.194
- He speaks Mandarin?
- Not according to his profile.

28:08.006 --> 28:13.219
I'm sending this to you.
See what you can make out of it, okay?

28:57.097 --> 28:58.581
What did O'Neill say to you?

28:59.057 --> 29:04.020
- He said that while we are not able
to always be close to each other

29:04.104 --> 29:07.977
in his mind we are together every moment.

29:13.905 --> 29:16.415
- You have used your time
to learn some Mandarin.

29:19.756 --> 29:21.877
You think that because
Lulu was built in China

29:21.889 --> 29:24.112
that you are communicating
in her native tongue?

29:25.875 --> 29:30.739
You are aware that Lulu has no
language preference? She's a machine.

29:33.171 --> 29:34.879
Something finally got to you.

29:39.514 --> 29:45.217
We treat all living things with humanity
and respect, but to us Lulu is hardware.

29:49.065 --> 29:52.684
Bearing that in mind, maybe you can
figure out a way to talk to me.

29:55.196 --> 29:58.514
- Presuming he's lucid,
there are options.

29:59.117 --> 30:03.205
Military interrogation units have used
another 75.6% success rate.

30:03.788 --> 30:08.674
- Side effects?
- For an unaffected mind, minimal.

30:09.961 --> 30:12.405
This is not a normal case, though.

30:13.339 --> 30:17.853
- I am not comfortable with potentially
making him worse in a 75.6% gamble.

30:18.470 --> 30:22.935
- There are more direct means.
- Like what? Torture?

30:23.974 --> 30:28.305
- Don't be so dramatic. ARTs could not
be trusted with this mission because

30:28.330 --> 30:32.255
their protective programming prohibits
acts of visceral persuasion.

30:32.942 --> 30:36.890
We do not have such limitations
and we should make use of that.

30:37.363 --> 30:41.474
Visceral persuasion sounds like
a nice way for saying torture.

30:41.785 --> 30:43.348
- Zimmer, I need an override.

30:50.543 --> 30:52.754
-Printing complete.

30:59.803 --> 31:02.768
I was able to get the shower head down,
but I can't access the water.

31:04.015 --> 31:09.062
You forget how reliant I am of voice
commands until they quit working.

31:15.902 --> 31:21.064
Oh, this turns it on and off
and sets the temperature.

31:22.367 --> 31:26.204
-Yeah, thanks.

31:26.287 --> 31:29.703
- Is that it?
- Yeah, I think I can manage now.

31:30.625 --> 31:33.056
- Are you sure?
- What do you mean?

31:33.420 --> 31:36.227
I mean, if there is something else
I can assist you with...

31:40.093 --> 31:42.429
Well, that was fast.

31:43.460 --> 31:44.842
-Please, stay with me.

31:47.468 --> 31:49.519
-Anderson?

31:49.602 --> 31:51.812
I don't want to be alone.

31:54.357 --> 31:58.424
- What is it?
- I just... I don't want to be alone.

31:59.927 --> 32:01.075
Will you stay with me?

32:02.991 --> 32:04.840
-Of course.

32:39.402 --> 32:41.487
-Detect language.

32:59.455 --> 33:01.255
-Warning, interior hatch...

33:04.344 --> 33:07.680
- Contain the breaks, an outside door
opened and we're losing atmosphere.

33:07.764 --> 33:09.611
-Which door?

33:13.478 --> 33:15.783
- What was that?
- Main Cargo Bay door.

33:32.914 --> 33:35.036
-We're locked out of the ship's system!

33:37.293 --> 33:38.589
Cargo bay door opened.

33:38.601 --> 33:42.090
The cargo hold should be isolated
from the rest of the ship.

33:42.173 --> 33:44.525
- Must be a break in the
air seal somewhere.

33:55.019 --> 33:58.084
- What are they doing?
- It's going into the cargo hold.

33:59.149 --> 34:03.486
- That's suicide!
- What's wrong with you?

34:43.400 --> 34:46.987
-Oh my God, they're dying!

34:55.371 --> 34:58.208
-I'm okay. Check Zimmer.

35:11.513 --> 35:15.975
- Diffuse cerebral hypoxia.
I have stabilized his oxygen levels.

35:16.059 --> 35:20.064
- With some rest, he should make it.
- How much rest?

35:21.815 --> 35:24.504
- How much rest?
- I don't know.

35:25.902 --> 35:28.558
A couple of hours, a day.
Whenever he wakes up.

35:30.156 --> 35:31.846
Did I say "when he wakes up?"

35:36.830 --> 35:40.310
I'm sorry, I don't know
what we were thinking.

35:40.322 --> 35:42.603
Because you weren't thinking.

35:45.004 --> 35:47.074
Zimmer assured me he
would have all the bugs

35:47.086 --> 35:48.983
out of the system by
the end of the day.

35:49.884 --> 35:53.547
But apparently his mind was focused on
primal indulges also.

35:54.597 --> 35:57.655
- You think this is my fault?
- I don't care whose fault it is.

35:58.351 --> 35:59.535
Just fix it.

36:09.779 --> 36:11.982
-I'm running out of patience with O'Neill.

36:12.741 --> 36:17.223
- As am I, but I think he's
trying to tell us something.

36:17.704 --> 36:21.469
- This mission will not be compromised
by delinquent behavioral issues.

36:22.083 --> 36:26.712
We need answers. Now.

36:30.759 --> 36:31.945
-Hey, Orson.

36:33.845 --> 36:39.559
- Have you ever known an ART to lie before?
- They are not capable of that.

36:41.436 --> 36:46.705
- When I asked Lulu what O'Neill said to
her in Mandarin, her exact words were:

36:47.066 --> 36:52.447
"He said that while we are not always
able to may be close to each other" -

36:52.530 --> 36:54.486
" in his mind, we are
together every moment."

36:57.472 --> 36:59.159
-And?

37:00.330 --> 37:02.070
-Could she have made it up?

37:04.250 --> 37:07.962
- ARTs can be reprogrammed to give
incorrect answers to specific questions.

37:08.046 --> 37:10.831
But they are not capable
of making up answers.

37:11.925 --> 37:16.609
When I examined Lulu, I saw no
evidence of that kind of reprogramming.

37:17.847 --> 37:19.064
-Thanks.

37:30.276 --> 37:34.443
- Our friend has used the past few years
to learn both Mandarin and Russian.

37:36.866 --> 37:40.669
Iris, that's not just Russian.
It's Tolstoy.

37:46.668 --> 37:50.053
"The higher a man stands
on a social ladder the

37:50.065 --> 37:53.675
greater the number of people
he's connected with."

37:55.051 --> 37:57.369
"War and Peace". Volume 2, Book 9.

37:59.833 --> 38:03.537
My mother is from the east Ukraine
so I grew up learning Russian.

38:04.394 --> 38:09.065
To show off my learning abilities, she
had me memorize classic literature.

38:09.149 --> 38:10.946
In Russian and recite it to people.

38:11.818 --> 38:14.792
- That makes sense for
you, but why him?

38:15.655 --> 38:19.912
Book search. "War and peace".
Bookmark Volume 2, Book 9.

38:20.201 --> 38:25.081
- Why does it make sense for me?
- Your mother is eastern Ukrainian.

38:25.165 --> 38:26.992
Where the majority speaks Russian.

38:28.877 --> 38:33.079
-Yeah, but why have me memorize it?

38:33.715 --> 38:36.865
What was the point
with these mind acrobatics?

38:39.137 --> 38:42.384
-What's wrong? Tell me what it is.

38:43.057 --> 38:45.274
You're obviously having some issues.

38:47.395 --> 38:52.039
It is fair to contemplate the meaning
of our existence. Is it not?

38:54.408 --> 38:55.607
Read the passage.

38:58.782 --> 39:01.345
"The higher a man stands
on a social ladder, the

39:01.357 --> 39:04.037
greater the number of people
he's connected with."

39:04.120 --> 39:07.387
"The more power he has
over other people."

39:08.041 --> 39:14.179
"the obvious is the predestination
and inevitability of his every action."

39:14.631 --> 39:21.262
- So when is the right time to contemplate
the meaning of our existence?

39:42.492 --> 39:47.940
- I have never heard of an
invalid who randomly recites Tolstoy.

39:48.874 --> 39:50.335
In Russian, no less.

39:51.251 --> 39:55.296
So that either makes you the most
unique case study in human history

39:55.380 --> 39:59.377
- or this whole psychologically
traumatized thing is a charade.

39:59.884 --> 40:01.486
I'm betting the latter.

40:08.643 --> 40:15.859
- You have to promise that what I say now
will stay between us.

40:18.737 --> 40:23.241
- Finally, a language
I understand.

40:24.284 --> 40:31.207
- And to our upcoming discussion
out without a hint of irritation.

40:31.291 --> 40:33.195
-What are you saying?

40:34.961 --> 40:38.089
You speak so archaic.

40:38.173 --> 40:42.635
- Almost all die of their remedies,
not of their diseases.

40:48.141 --> 40:49.776
-More literature.

41:09.621 --> 41:12.527
- Incoming message.
- I have communications working.

41:13.124 --> 41:15.043
OK, I'll be there in a minute.

41:18.129 --> 41:22.673
We received your transmission.
I want to reiterate the mission objective.

41:23.968 --> 41:28.640
To retrieve and return the cargo.
This is top priority.

41:28.723 --> 41:31.847
Everything else is secondary. I
repeat, everything else is secondary.

41:31.872 --> 41:34.147
- This is exactly the same
thing he said before.

41:34.437 --> 41:37.524
- It's a recording. I'm getting the
same message every two hours.

41:37.607 --> 41:40.735
- You've sent our previous messages, right?
- Yes!

41:40.819 --> 41:44.989
- Well, send them again, without
encryption. Someone has to respond.

41:48.243 --> 41:52.372
Honestly, what is wrong with you?

41:54.582 --> 41:57.276
- I don't know, I don't
know what's wrong with me.

41:57.669 --> 41:59.868
- You have never behaved
this irrationally before.

42:02.966 --> 42:07.846
Stop crying, Emma. Stop crying.

42:07.929 --> 42:12.392
Act like what you are.
Stop crying. Stop it!

42:16.646 --> 42:19.023
You're okay?-

42:25.780 --> 42:28.329
- This carnal affair
nearly got us all killed.

42:30.118 --> 42:32.898
- The cargo bay door opening
was a timer set on the

42:32.910 --> 42:35.540
exterior of the ship. I
had no way of knowing...

42:35.623 --> 42:39.085
-God damn it! It's your job to know

42:41.421 --> 42:44.508
Anderson have Oreon look you over.
Check for

42:44.520 --> 42:47.343
post stasis psychosis
or something else.

42:48.428 --> 42:50.555
Now!

43:03.318 --> 43:06.494
- I reviewed the back log information
that was sent during stasis.

43:08.406 --> 43:11.003
The first year was thorough,
but the second year became

43:11.015 --> 43:13.764
more sparse until it nearly
ceased about three months ago.

43:14.579 --> 43:18.833
As if the information
has been purposely censored.

43:22.629 --> 43:25.195
For Christ's sake Zimmer,
get over yourself.

43:25.207 --> 43:26.633
Turn the mirror around.

43:26.716 --> 43:31.096
Since when did you become
a temperamental prick?

43:31.179 --> 43:35.391
- I have work to do.
It so do you.

43:47.904 --> 43:50.532
Find literary match-.

43:50.615 --> 43:54.994
"Nearly all men die of the remedies,
and not of their illnesses."

43:55.078 --> 44:00.125
Molière. "The imaginary sickness",
act 3, scene 3."

44:20.061 --> 44:22.313
-Overhead off.

44:30.363 --> 44:32.679
All your bio signs are normal.

44:34.159 --> 44:36.827
- Why am I having these
emotional reactions?

44:36.852 --> 44:38.228
-There is nothing wrong with you.

44:39.673 --> 44:42.606
- We've gotta get the
cargo out of here, now!

44:42.618 --> 44:45.434
We'll destroy anyone
that tries to stop us.

44:46.504 --> 44:48.792
-Operations are fully online.

44:50.633 --> 44:52.801
-Do not get too excited about it.

44:53.970 --> 44:55.734
What have you found?

44:55.746 --> 45:00.185
From the beginning, nothing
has been a coincidence.

45:00.268 --> 45:02.667
The ship was never in real danger.

45:03.480 --> 45:08.735
It was purposely put close to Titan's
atmosphere shortly before we arrived.

45:08.809 --> 45:12.938
- What for?
- I think it's part of O'Neill's narrative.

45:13.039 --> 45:16.534
- Narrative? All he's done is
mutter around nonsense.

45:18.953 --> 45:21.841
- He is trying to tell us something.
This were embedded

45:21.853 --> 45:24.442
in the noise that we heard
when we first arrived.

45:25.627 --> 45:27.629
Play first vocal track.

45:27.712 --> 45:31.102
- The cargo will not be compromised!
I order the use

45:31.114 --> 45:34.260
of every force against
anyone that goes near it!

45:34.344 --> 45:39.224
- Identify voice.
- Former Commander of the Atromitos.

45:39.307 --> 45:41.935
-The crew did not randomly go crazy.

45:42.018 --> 45:45.734
There was a dispute about the cargo
that led to war in factions.

45:46.272 --> 45:47.672
Over profits, no doubt.

45:47.684 --> 45:50.902
I don't think that the cargo
is what we've been told.

45:53.238 --> 45:57.575
- And you? Have you noticed
anything about yourself? that's different.

45:59.911 --> 46:02.539
You have, haven't you?

46:02.622 --> 46:07.003
- Show transverse hallway aft.
Switch to ultraviolet light.

46:09.963 --> 46:13.967
These aren't just squiggly lines.
It's chemistry.

46:14.050 --> 46:19.347
This is a water base liquid compound
reacting with a foreign substance.

46:19.431 --> 46:22.725
Show transverse hallway forward.

46:23.644 --> 46:25.402
The symbolism here is water.

46:26.521 --> 46:29.441
Show cargo bay starboard side.

46:29.524 --> 46:32.948
This is where O'Neill was
right after his jailbreak.

46:33.987 --> 46:36.754
I thought it curious
that when I moved, he

46:36.766 --> 46:39.868
didn't shift the barrel
of his rifle to follow.

46:39.951 --> 46:43.621
That's because he wasn’t aiming at me,
he was aiming at the panel behind me.

46:43.705 --> 46:46.702
This is the panel to the main
water filtration system.

46:47.751 --> 46:51.254
Whatever the compound is,
it reacts badly with water.

46:51.337 --> 46:53.294
And the cargo
bay door opening?

46:53.306 --> 46:55.970
It was where the cargo
was jettisoned from.

46:56.634 --> 47:01.931
- None of this helps us find it.
- What about the nature of the cargo?

47:02.223 --> 47:04.316
What if it is
harmful to humans?

47:04.328 --> 47:07.395
Let's find it before we
make that determination.

47:07.479 --> 47:11.650
All we have at the moment is cryptic
messages from a socially deranged inferior.

47:13.193 --> 47:16.097
- I'm gonna pretend that you did not
just called him "inferior".

47:16.571 --> 47:19.077
- If it wasn't for people like
him we wouldn't even be here.

47:19.102 --> 47:23.411
- If it wasn't for people like
him, we might not exist at all.

47:23.495 --> 47:25.597
-Focus on what we came here for.

47:34.422 --> 47:35.851
-Clever messages.

47:36.758 --> 47:39.239
I suppose it would have
been too much trouble

47:39.251 --> 47:41.743
for you to come out and
tell us these things?

47:43.932 --> 47:45.879
What did the compound do?

47:47.560 --> 47:50.910
The name of your ship Teleios
in Greek means "perfect",

47:53.399 --> 47:55.107
-Yes, it does.

47:57.404 --> 48:01.387
- Named after its crew
of flawless humans.

48:02.534 --> 48:04.587
We don’t name our ship.

48:04.599 --> 48:08.646
Don't suppose you
protested the name, either.

48:09.374 --> 48:15.296
- You've made your point about
language acumen. For what purpose?

48:17.090 --> 48:19.356
-Maybe you missed the Tolstoy quote.

48:22.262 --> 48:26.975
"The higher a man stands on the social
ladder the greater the number..."

48:27.058 --> 48:28.790
- "the number of people
that he is connected

48:28.802 --> 48:30.663
with, The more power he
ha over other people" -

48:30.687 --> 48:35.571
- "the more obvious the predestination
and inevitability of his every action."

48:36.317 --> 48:40.516
What do you presume
our predestination to be?

48:41.262 --> 48:45.493
- To bring about the destruction
of imperfect people like me.

48:46.578 --> 48:49.914
What does the compound do?

48:59.591 --> 49:02.886
Tell me!

49:19.235 --> 49:24.407
- Duncan, What's wrong with your hand?
- Nothing.

49:25.950 --> 49:28.244
-I was going to...

49:30.080 --> 49:33.416
I do not remember what I' was going to.

49:37.462 --> 49:40.637
- If it were released, the cargo would
have pulled into Titan's atmosphere.

49:41.382 --> 49:44.427
- The container was designed to
withstand re-entry and landing.

49:44.511 --> 49:45.984
-How do we locate it?

49:46.009 --> 49:50.427
- Without more information, it would be
like hunting for a single grain of sand.

49:51.059 --> 49:53.812
The crowd volcanoes started
off a chain reaction.

49:53.895 --> 49:59.199
In days surface visibility will be
almost nonexistent across Titan.

49:59.651 --> 50:01.847
- This is our only trump card.
If this

50:01.859 --> 50:04.406
doesn’t work we can
expect nothing from him.

50:04.489 --> 50:07.260
Which is no different that
what he's told us so far.

50:07.336 --> 50:09.302
He's told us a great deal.

50:09.679 --> 50:11.001
-Do it.

50:15.166 --> 50:19.170
- Does anyone care what I think?
- What do you think, Duncan?

50:28.096 --> 50:30.458
-No permanent damage.

50:43.611 --> 50:48.867
I see you've taken advantage of
Zimmer fixing voice control.

50:48.950 --> 50:52.267
I have just one question
and I need a direct answer.

50:53.413 --> 50:55.083
Where's the cargo?

50:59.002 --> 51:03.506
Where is the cargo?

51:18.229 --> 51:19.660
-Sit down over there, Lulu.

51:39.793 --> 51:41.266
Raise your left arm.

51:50.512 --> 51:52.323
-Last chance to answer.

52:43.940 --> 52:46.752
-Well-made, these AH-320 units.

52:47.819 --> 52:53.658
Titanium. Endoskeleton
Very lifelike.

53:13.803 --> 53:16.381
- We can't do this.
- Why?

53:17.307 --> 53:20.504
- Our mission. We have to stay focused...
- Fuck our mission!

53:20.551 --> 53:21.551
-What?

53:22.849 --> 53:24.185
How can you say that?

53:25.231 --> 53:30.021
- When was the last time you did
something just because you wanted to do it?

53:31.029 --> 53:35.894
You've always been expected to do things.
We all have.

53:36.747 --> 53:41.564
We're the chosen ones, but the one thing
we don't seem to have is a choice.

53:42.999 --> 53:46.461
-Because of who we are.

53:46.544 --> 53:47.601
-Says who?

53:52.301 --> 53:56.846
- Why do you want me? I can't
even control my own emotions.

53:56.930 --> 53:58.008
-Neither can I.

54:02.685 --> 54:05.327
-Linden was right. I...

54:06.189 --> 54:10.674
I shouldn’t have made those mistakes.
I never would have before. I...

54:12.583 --> 54:14.048
I'm distracted.

54:16.574 --> 54:20.427
I try to look at this data,
I try to do my job, but

54:20.954 --> 54:28.711
the only thing that I can think about, the
only thing that... means anything to me,

54:29.570 --> 54:32.155
is you.

54:35.969 --> 54:37.231
-But why?

54:39.264 --> 54:43.041
- I'm a mess.
- No.

54:45.770 --> 54:47.899
I'm seeing you for the first time.

54:50.442 --> 54:53.567
And you are the most beautiful
thing I have ever laid eyes on.

55:32.294 --> 55:33.775
- I didn't tell you
you could get up.

55:37.030 --> 55:41.059
The AH-320s have most of their
vital functions well protected.

55:41.785 --> 55:46.998
Except, there is a soft spot, right...

55:47.888 --> 55:49.396
here.

55:56.883 --> 55:58.893
But you already knew that, right?

56:00.867 --> 56:03.348
Because you have been doing
some changing up here.

56:06.392 --> 56:09.866
There is another soft access panel...

56:12.190 --> 56:16.694
right behind the cranium.

56:17.779 --> 56:19.291
-Stop!

56:20.615 --> 56:22.122
-He speaks.

56:23.952 --> 56:25.164
-Stop.

56:28.748 --> 56:30.065
-Tracking codes.

56:33.128 --> 56:34.574
Tracking codes!

56:36.655 --> 56:39.138
DI713.

56:42.983 --> 56:44.333
Delta, Beta.

56:45.473 --> 56:46.701
Kat was set.

56:47.559 --> 56:48.852
-See?

56:51.132 --> 56:52.754
That wasn't so hard.

57:08.621 --> 57:10.615
-It shouldn't have come to this.

57:13.793 --> 57:15.340
-What does a compound do?

57:17.046 --> 57:19.366
- I have already told you
all you need to know.

57:21.589 --> 57:26.514
- You've seen how that hardly works.
- Okay, I'll explain everything.

57:29.392 --> 57:31.297
Just allow me to repair her.

57:32.645 --> 57:36.733
There's a set of tools in
the cargo bay. Please?

57:45.283 --> 57:50.163
- Zimmer, report to the bridge.
Zimmer, report!

57:54.084 --> 57:56.795
-Goddammit, open the door.

57:58.213 --> 58:00.186
What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

58:00.211 --> 58:01.680
-Your belligerent piece of shit.

58:01.705 --> 58:05.345
- Fuck you!
- Stop it, both of you calm down!

58:05.428 --> 58:08.431
- Hey...
- Calm down!

58:11.392 --> 58:12.623
-Commander...

58:14.687 --> 58:16.269
We have work to do.

58:21.194 --> 58:27.367
- Detecting rectangular object composed of
A.S.T.M.A. A-588 alloy.

58:27.450 --> 58:30.180
- There is a metal container
at the tracking coordinates he gave us.

58:31.538 --> 58:34.290
Too much methane to get a visual, though.

58:34.374 --> 58:37.881
- Can we get dimensions? I want to
make sure this is not another game.

58:38.503 --> 58:41.288
- I don't think he'd be screwing around
after what he's been through.

58:42.090 --> 58:44.021
-We only have a short window.

58:47.262 --> 58:49.868
- Zimmer, you are coming with me
on the landing pod to Titan.

58:50.849 --> 58:54.494
Orson, stay back with
Anderson and Duncan.

59:03.069 --> 59:04.297
-Talk first.

59:20.253 --> 59:26.031
- Sometimes... terrible mistakes can only
be made right by equally terrible choices.

59:29.492 --> 59:31.104
For a year I tried to forget.

59:32.999 --> 59:35.153
I jettisoned the bodies and the cargo,

59:36.755 --> 59:39.481
erased all memory that I've
been on the ship, including Lulu's.

59:45.278 --> 59:48.759
No matter how hard I tried, I
couldn't erase my own memories.

59:50.700 --> 59:52.804
It's the curse of
the human brain.

01:00:04.005 --> 01:00:05.795
So I tried something else.

01:00:07.694 --> 01:00:09.153
I embraced it.

01:00:17.352 --> 01:00:19.794
I visualized the death and
carnage over and over.

01:00:20.438 --> 01:00:25.485
Everything I learned and read, I saw
reflections of what had happened to me.

01:00:25.758 --> 01:00:28.459
That alone I realized I
was connected with human

01:00:28.471 --> 01:00:31.074
experience in a way I
never understood before.

01:00:31.157 --> 01:00:35.078
That couldn't have been explained
by data or the ship's log.

01:00:35.161 --> 01:00:36.952
This evidence needed to be removed.

01:00:46.297 --> 01:00:50.664
There is no black and white,
only abstractions.

01:00:54.931 --> 01:00:58.354
Only the randomness of uncertainty
and pain of choice.

01:01:07.277 --> 01:01:13.074
All that was left for me was how
to tell the story in my own terms.

01:01:32.302 --> 01:01:33.913
We completed the mission.

01:01:35.847 --> 01:01:39.923
The compound was contained in over
24 hours from their return flight.

01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:42.479
The liquor was flowing.

01:01:44.731 --> 01:01:46.855
-He is choking.

01:01:47.776 --> 01:01:50.911
- The compound that we got
from Titan, the wonderful

01:01:50.923 --> 01:01:53.891
compound that was supposed
to fix the atmosphere,

01:01:54.199 --> 01:01:56.742
one microscopic bit on
someone's glove got

01:01:56.754 --> 01:01:59.488
through quarantine and
into the water supply.

01:01:59.788 --> 01:02:02.624
One spore made all our water lethal.

01:02:02.707 --> 01:02:05.707
What do you expect a batch of this could
do with the water supply on Earth'?

01:02:06.961 --> 01:02:10.629
- Was Glen Crest told what
the compound could do?

01:02:11.633 --> 01:02:13.042
-That's the best part.

01:02:14.260 --> 01:02:18.996
At this point, all of us thought
we were dead. No water -no life.

01:02:19.349 --> 01:02:22.486
We contacted earth base, basically
let them know that we were

01:02:22.498 --> 01:02:25.698
fucked. and that the compound is
not what they thought it was.

01:02:25.958 --> 01:02:28.974
But surprise, surprise, he
tells us that in storage on

01:02:28.986 --> 01:02:31.903
the ship we happen to have
a water filtration system

01:02:31.986 --> 01:02:34.906
designed to eliminate the compound.

01:02:35.004 --> 01:02:39.634
Proprietary and patent protected
by the Glen Crest, of course.

01:02:40.474 --> 01:02:42.150
Two sides emerged.

01:02:43.648 --> 01:02:47.919
I remained silent. Those who tried to stop
the compound from returning to Earth -

01:02:48.002 --> 01:02:50.243
were slaughtered by those
who couldn't unleash

01:02:50.255 --> 01:02:52.507
themselves from the masters
of their paycheck.

01:03:01.266 --> 01:03:03.915
We hate the villain, but
we still respect them.

01:03:08.106 --> 01:03:14.104
There's no respect for cowards.
- Yet you were the only one to survive.

01:03:15.155 --> 01:03:18.671
How? -Have you looked at our profile
and expect I was the only survivor?

01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:21.607
No, In fact, did not.

01:03:22.949 --> 01:03:24.480
That's how I survived.

01:03:32.922 --> 01:03:38.094
Killing was easy. They were
completely unsuspecting it.

01:03:41.681 --> 01:03:43.741
The compound isn't a cure.

01:03:45.518 --> 01:03:49.369
They already had the cure.
What they needed was the disease.

01:03:53.735 --> 01:03:58.467
These were the same jackasses who designed
all you awesome, perfect GC humans.

01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:35.812
-Incoming transmission.

01:04:39.614 --> 01:04:42.522
- This will probably the last time
you hear from me.

01:04:44.744 --> 01:04:48.265
By now you may be
experiencing feeling,

01:04:48.277 --> 01:04:52.252
emotions things you have
never known before.

01:04:52.335 --> 01:04:57.523
Fear, anxiety, anger...

01:04:59.197 --> 01:05:00.197
forgetfulness.

01:05:01.845 --> 01:05:04.027
Things you never really supposed to have.

01:05:07.353 --> 01:05:11.087
Glen Crest put a proprietary code...

01:05:11.521 --> 01:05:15.358
At the DNA of every GC human.

01:05:15.442 --> 01:05:17.210
A fingerprint.

01:05:20.405 --> 01:05:25.700
It was supposed to be
inert, a tracking code.

01:05:27.245 --> 01:05:31.458
But it is mutating.

01:05:33.501 --> 01:05:37.467
And it is causing irreversible
neurological problems.

01:05:42.218 --> 01:05:46.140
GCs have never known emotions so
they don't know how to control them.

01:05:46.973 --> 01:05:49.069
And so the downfall is fast.

01:05:49.934 --> 01:05:53.273
The earth is burning.
Regular humans are being

01:05:53.285 --> 01:05:56.280
hunted down and harvested
for their blood

01:05:58.051 --> 01:06:00.830
to keep GCs temporarily stable.

01:06:04.535 --> 01:06:05.958
Before long...

01:06:07.410 --> 01:06:13.625
you will all be irreversibly
losing your minds. I'm sorry.

01:06:25.845 --> 01:06:27.682
I'm very sorry.

01:06:32.102 --> 01:06:33.703
-We have the symptoms.

01:06:34.979 --> 01:06:38.358
Linden is impulsive,
Chris sexual urges.

01:06:38.441 --> 01:06:42.144
I keep losing my train of
thought and this one...

01:06:43.780 --> 01:06:45.325
a nervous wreck.

01:06:48.576 --> 01:06:52.414
O'Neill's blood type's O negative
making him compatible to all of us.

01:06:52.497 --> 01:06:56.459
We must replace some
of our blood with his, before stasis.

01:06:56.543 --> 01:06:59.666
- and hope by the time we get back
they found the permanent cure.

01:07:00.797 --> 01:07:03.569
- How much blood?
- Two pints for each of us.

01:07:04.551 --> 01:07:07.548
- That will kill him!
- It will be painless.

01:07:09.889 --> 01:07:12.865
- No decision can be made on that
until Linden and Zimmer return.

01:07:13.005 --> 01:07:16.181
- The more time that passes,
the more like preemies we become.

01:07:17.105 --> 01:07:19.026
Increasing the odds
that we succumb to the

01:07:19.038 --> 01:07:21.151
same illogical that destroyed
the previous crew!

01:07:21.529 --> 01:07:23.007
-How long until they get back?

01:07:25.071 --> 01:07:29.784
- Assuming all goes well -16 hours.
- O'Neill is a murderer.

01:07:29.868 --> 01:07:33.743
- Faulty DNA or not, I am
still the first officer.

01:07:34.414 --> 01:07:35.650
We wait!

01:07:39.127 --> 01:07:40.170
-Whatever you say.

01:07:51.014 --> 01:07:55.478
- Put it down.
- We'll continue to degenerate.

01:07:56.424 --> 01:07:58.883
The longer you wait, the worse
it is gonna be for all of us.

01:07:59.773 --> 01:08:04.118
- Meditate, run on a treadmill,
masturbate, I don't give a shit.

01:08:04.986 --> 01:08:06.639
Just keep it together.

01:08:15.747 --> 01:08:17.345
-You 're out of your mind.

01:08:33.765 --> 01:08:36.903
Are you just going to
stand there for 16 hours?

01:08:41.272 --> 01:08:42.809
-If I have to.

01:09:06.756 --> 01:09:09.634
- Break it up! Break it up!
- You want to die here?

01:09:09.716 --> 01:09:13.100
- Turn around, motherfucker! Come on!
- Break it up!

01:09:18.143 --> 01:09:22.419
- The cargo is secure.
- We have bigger problems now.

01:09:25.066 --> 01:09:28.848
- The condition is making it difficult
for some of us to clearly think.

01:09:29.821 --> 01:09:33.334
We may all be susceptible to fail errors
like the one Zimmer has been making.

01:09:34.367 --> 01:09:36.557
-That's why we need O'Neill's blood.

01:09:37.495 --> 01:09:40.497
Nordham said that regular
humans were being harvested.

01:09:40.582 --> 01:09:43.854
Which indicates that GC
humans still function, it's

01:09:43.867 --> 01:09:47.087
just our emotional dispositions
that have changed.

01:09:47.171 --> 01:09:49.880
- What fucking difference
does it make? Clearly

01:09:49.892 --> 01:09:52.385
we are unable to perform
at the same level.

01:09:52.469 --> 01:09:55.596
- What if the compound is lethal
like O'Neill is saying?

01:09:56.514 --> 01:09:58.763
How are we supposed to believe
anything Glen Crest is

01:09:58.775 --> 01:10:00.994
telling us?
- We will complete this mission, Zimmer.

01:10:01.311 --> 01:10:04.689
There's no option.
No possible recourse but success.

01:10:04.773 --> 01:10:06.391
-Define success.

01:10:10.528 --> 01:10:15.033
- I know you think I'm a monster,
but I have no hidden agenda.

01:10:15.124 --> 01:10:20.023
I assure you all that my one and only goal
is the safety and well-being of this team.

01:10:22.619 --> 01:10:26.406
Anderson, reiterate the specific
protocol for this situation.

01:10:27.045 --> 01:10:31.174
- "When it comes to a decision that may
result in the death of another human," -

01:10:31.257 --> 01:10:33.630
- "the majority must be in
favor of that decision.."

01:10:34.052 --> 01:10:36.369
All of those in favor of
extracting O'Neill's blood?

01:10:39.349 --> 01:10:40.459
Those against?

01:10:44.145 --> 01:10:47.334
- Zimmer's judgment’s
been clouded by a vagina.

01:10:48.543 --> 01:10:50.415
Better than clouded by sadism.

01:10:51.361 --> 01:10:55.353
Either O'Neill dies or
we go insane and we die.

01:10:55.990 --> 01:10:58.422
It's one versus five. It's simple math.
- You're

01:10:58.434 --> 01:11:00.977
not allowed to abstain, Duncan.
What is your vote?

01:11:11.589 --> 01:11:14.298
- Do it.
- Finally!

01:11:15.009 --> 01:11:17.662
- Duncan, go with Orson, in
case O'Neill causes trouble.

01:11:17.674 --> 01:11:20.058
I'll stay here and ensure
there's no interference.

01:11:36.159 --> 01:11:38.470
- Am I going to die?
- Yes.

01:11:39.617 --> 01:11:44.372
- At least please tell me why.
- Does it matter?

01:11:44.456 --> 01:11:47.320
- There was a code programmed
to our DNA that's mutating.

01:11:48.209 --> 01:11:51.219
Your blood is the last
chance we have for survival.

01:11:51.231 --> 01:11:53.190
So you're just
human, after all.

01:11:54.089 --> 01:11:57.067
Creating us was the one
thing your kind did right.

01:11:57.761 --> 01:11:59.939
And even that was tainted by greed.

01:12:02.265 --> 01:12:04.120
-I'll take it from here.

01:12:10.315 --> 01:12:12.734
- Don't trust him like
that. I don't trust Orson.

01:12:12.817 --> 01:12:16.512
Even if he's psychologically
deranged, that would be suicidal.

01:12:16.524 --> 01:12:17.760
I know what I saw.

01:12:26.601 --> 01:12:29.501
- Draw your own conclusions.
- What did you see?

01:12:29.584 --> 01:12:33.963
- She thinks Orson's going to kill us all.
- Orson had put it on a tablet.

01:12:34.047 --> 01:12:36.368
I saw it in the medical room
where he did my examination.

01:12:36.673 --> 01:12:37.673
-What?

01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:43.724
- It said: "Hence when we are able
to attack we must seem unable."

01:12:44.344 --> 01:12:46.771
"When using our forces
we must seem inactive."

01:12:47.519 --> 01:12:50.855
"When we are near, we must make the
enemy believe that we are far away."

01:12:50.939 --> 01:12:54.116
"And when we are far away we must
make him believe that we are near."

01:12:58.446 --> 01:13:02.158
A quote by Sun Tzu "The Art of War".

01:13:02.242 --> 01:13:07.956
What you saw was a translation
of something O'Neill said... to Lulu.

01:13:16.388 --> 01:13:20.908
-He... It wasn't him who killed crew.

01:13:22.262 --> 01:13:23.874
It was her!

01:13:27.350 --> 01:13:29.727
Fuck, let's go.

01:14:23.156 --> 01:14:25.493
With the combat shift, she
is every bit our equal.

01:14:26.910 --> 01:14:29.586
- It's not possible to alter
the aggression inhibitor

01:14:29.598 --> 01:14:31.788
on AH-320 without
disabling an entire unit.

01:14:32.791 --> 01:14:37.195
- Clearly, it is possible, idiot.
- We don't have time to argue.

01:14:37.921 --> 01:14:42.237
- Turn rifles to maximum. So we won't have
any effect against Lulu's surge protector.

01:14:42.550 --> 01:14:44.048
You two guard the hallway.

01:14:48.306 --> 01:14:50.565
She be carrying O'Neill
which we can use to our

01:14:50.577 --> 01:14:52.847
advantage. How long will
he remain unconscious?

01:14:53.478 --> 01:14:56.257
- Not long.
She took the stimuli packs.

01:14:57.148 --> 01:15:01.985
- What do you think her next move is?
- To kill all of us.

01:15:07.867 --> 01:15:08.971
Chris.

01:15:12.038 --> 01:15:14.992
I need for you to know
that whatever happens...

01:15:20.171 --> 01:15:22.273
I want you to know I love you.

01:15:26.678 --> 01:15:28.029
-Anderson...

01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:39.355
-I'm moving in. Cover me.

01:15:42.777 --> 01:15:48.404
- Warning. Power loss
sections 2, 4, 7 and 10.

01:16:11.931 --> 01:16:15.119
- Think, this through, she'll
kill you if you go there alone.

01:16:16.102 --> 01:16:19.674
- I don't care.
- The point was trying to stop him.

01:16:20.363 --> 01:16:23.278
He's better off if we use his
impulsiveness as a diversion.

01:16:49.344 --> 01:16:52.910
- Come out and face me!
I know you are in here!

01:19:39.848 --> 01:19:41.318
-Clever girl.

01:19:49.482 --> 01:19:53.006
<i>- Warning. Fire
detected in section 7.</i>

01:19:54.195 --> 01:19:56.479
<i>Main sprinkler activated.</i>

01:20:08.543 --> 01:20:11.278
I'd kill you with my own hands
but it wastes too much blood.

01:20:11.290 --> 01:20:12.380
Please let me see her.

01:20:12.464 --> 01:20:15.243
Your fighting bot or your
mechanical mistress?

01:20:19.846 --> 01:20:22.599
I'll admit even I underestimated
the depth of your depravity.

01:20:22.682 --> 01:20:25.472
- I gave her the fighting chip
and she is not my mistress.

01:20:26.227 --> 01:20:29.522
-Excuse me. fuck toy.

01:20:29.606 --> 01:20:33.860
- Are you ready?
- I didn't alter her physically.

01:20:33.943 --> 01:20:35.950
-You expect me to believe that?

01:20:39.449 --> 01:20:41.544
It doesn't matter now, does it?
- No.

01:20:42.035 --> 01:20:46.312
- Sometimes terrible mistakes can only be
made right by equally terrible choices.

01:20:46.956 --> 01:20:50.652
- What are you talking about?
- Just something somebody told me once.

01:20:51.044 --> 01:20:52.262
-Let's do this.

01:21:02.263 --> 01:21:05.083
-It wasn't supposed to end like this.

01:21:27.288 --> 01:21:33.527
- The GC process in the first generation
had a 97% success rate.

01:21:34.879 --> 01:21:37.088
I was the other 3%.

01:21:41.094 --> 01:21:43.555
My IQ was on par, but

01:21:45.172 --> 01:21:48.791
my uneven disposition put
me in the failure column.

01:21:49.894 --> 01:21:54.671
I was extremely emotional,
written off as a lost cause.

01:21:57.610 --> 01:22:02.275
I learned to control my
"undesirable" behavior.

01:22:04.125 --> 01:22:07.644
That's why the DNA mutation hasn't
affected me as much as the others.

01:22:11.332 --> 01:22:13.163
-What made you decide not to kill me?

01:22:15.449 --> 01:22:17.995
- You said you didn't alter
Lulu physically.

01:22:40.445 --> 01:22:42.485
- I don't know if she can
be reprogrammed.

01:22:44.621 --> 01:22:48.472
- She gave herself sexual
characteristics. Why?

01:22:49.699 --> 01:22:51.136
-So we could get closer.

01:22:52.415 --> 01:22:55.054
- She lied when I asked
her what you had said to her.

01:22:56.711 --> 01:22:58.307
Did you program her to lie?

01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:00.760
-No.

01:23:01.591 --> 01:23:05.428
- How is this possible?
- If only if she could answer that.

01:23:10.016 --> 01:23:15.099
- Take her back to Teleios. Go back
to earth. It's your best chance.

01:23:16.453 --> 01:23:20.017
- What about you?
- I'm staying.

01:23:24.781 --> 01:23:30.635
When I was young, I nearly
killed someone in rage.

01:23:33.623 --> 01:23:36.852
They hadn't even done
anything wrong, I just...

01:23:37.710 --> 01:23:40.018
I just couldn't
control my temper.

01:23:44.008 --> 01:23:49.305
I may seem fine now,
but you're not safe with me.

01:23:53.607 --> 01:23:55.076
Tell your story.

01:23:56.896 --> 01:24:02.628
Tell everybody what happened here. - Tell
who? What kind of place am I going back to?

01:24:05.043 --> 01:24:06.487
-Do what you do best.

01:24:09.308 --> 01:24:10.790
Survive.

01:24:31.848 --> 01:24:35.085
- Set course for Earth.
- Setting course.

01:24:35.602 --> 01:24:40.005
Arrival at destination in
2 years and 339 days.

01:24:40.607 --> 01:24:41.607
-Proceed.

01:25:13.098 --> 01:25:17.356
- Set course for surface of Titan.
- Setting course.

01:25:19.854 --> 01:25:21.379
-Maximum speed.

01:25:24.067 --> 01:25:27.348
- Rapid descent will cause
hull rupture entering

01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:30.115
atmosphere ship's
destruction on impact.

01:25:30.198 --> 01:25:33.765
- Override safety protocol.
- Authorization required.

01:25:48.091 --> 01:25:49.998
Authorization confirmed.

01:26:06.609 --> 01:26:10.160
Our strengths and weaknesses
are constructs of what we believe.

01:26:10.697 --> 01:26:14.460
There is no such thing as limitation
but what is on our minds.

01:26:15.417 --> 01:26:19.148
There is no destiny,
of what we ourselves manifest.
