00:08.210 --> 00:11.418
MANHATI'AN, NEW YORK

00:32.250 --> 00:34.536
Abuse.MALE VOICE: Abuse.

01:15.080 --> 01:16.877
So you a Knick fan?

01:19.790 --> 01:22.452
Ten million a year
they're paying Larry Brown.

01:22.460 --> 01:25.952
I could make them suck just as bad
for half of that.

01:30.460 --> 01:32.030
You from here?

01:33.120 --> 01:34.280
You're not?

01:36.620 --> 01:37.996
Out-of-town?

01:45.330 --> 01:46.877
Suit yourself.

02:09.210 --> 02:10.495
Murder.

02:10.500 --> 02:11.740
Kill.

02:13.170 --> 02:15.957
You sure this is where you want to be?

02:22.000 --> 02:23.490
You hear me?

02:28.120 --> 02:29.576
Walter Derbin, age 52.

02:29.580 --> 02:31.878
His body was found in his cab
in East Harlem.

02:31.880 --> 02:34.417
He was blindfolded
and shot once in the chest.

02:34.420 --> 02:37.162
Death was caused
by a knife stabbed through his ear.

02:37.170 --> 02:41.322
The UnSub broke off the handle
with the blade lodged in his brain.

02:41.330 --> 02:43.912
It's the same signature
as two other murders.

02:43.920 --> 02:47.538
Rachel Holman, 24, found in
her apartment three weeks ago

02:47.540 --> 02:49.496
on the Lower East Side.

02:49.500 --> 02:51.741
And Kaveh Surrani, 30.

02:51.750 --> 02:55.379
Police found him two_weeks lat_er inside
hIS painting studio In Hell's Kitchen.

02:55.380 --> 02:57.200
Different locations,
different victimology.

02:57.210 --> 02:59.952
It's possible we're looking for someone
who will hunt indiscriminately.

02:59.960 --> 03:02.201
-NYPD have any leads?
-Guy's a ghost.

03:02.210 --> 03:04.576
He kills at night. There's no witnesses.

03:04.580 --> 03:06.616
Is the NYPD feeling the strain?

03:06.620 --> 03:08.201
Well, they've withheld details

03:08.210 --> 03:10.496
so the press hasn't sniffed out a link
between the murders.

03:10.500 --> 03:14.459
With no discernible victim patterns,
a killer's practically impossible to stop.

03:14.460 --> 03:16.109
Did you know the original Zodiac Killer

03:16.120 --> 03:18.247
actually continually changed his victims?

03:18.250 --> 03:20.616
Young, old, men, women, white, black.

03:20.620 --> 03:24.659
Exactly. And he killed for 30 years
without ever being caught.

04:09.670 --> 04:11.114
W. H. Auden said,

04:11.120 --> 04:15.375
"Murder is unique in that
it abolishes the party it injures.

04:15.380 --> 04:18.531
"So that society must take the place
of the victim

04:18.540 --> 04:23.034
"and, on his behalf, demand
atonement or grant forgiveness."

04:23.040 --> 04:26.749
This is not how I planned to spend
a few days home in New York.

04:26.750 --> 04:30.743
I'd kill for an afternoon
at Barneys and dinner at Il Cantinori.

04:30.750 --> 04:33.571
I'm looking forward to seeing New York.

04:34.120 --> 04:37.112
-You've never been to New York?
-We've never had an UnSub there.

04:37.120 --> 04:40.283
I thought you were going to talk to
Reid about taking some vacation time.

04:40.290 --> 04:41.575
What's vacation time?

04:41.580 --> 04:43.320
Reid, it's a one-hour flight.

04:43.330 --> 04:45.742
Well, if we have some time,
I'll show you around.

04:45.750 --> 04:47.320
It's a three-hour train ride, man.

04:49.120 --> 04:50.417
Okay, here's what we know.

04:50.420 --> 04:52.069
Blitz attackers are almost always male.

04:52.080 --> 04:54.321
And he got picked up in the
pouring rain by a New York cabbie,

04:54.330 --> 04:56.912
so we definitely know he's not a brother.

04:56.920 --> 04:59.662
The fact that he kills in a major
urban setting without detection

04:59.670 --> 05:01.035
indicates he's highly intelligent.

05:01.040 --> 05:02.576
How intelligent can he be?

05:02.580 --> 05:05.572
I mean, blitz attackers
are textbook disorganized killers.

05:05.580 --> 05:07.491
Yeah, but he brings along a murder kit.

05:07.500 --> 05:10.162
Blindfold, knife.
How disorganized can he be?

05:10.170 --> 05:12.741
We'll split up.
We'll take the last two crime scenes.

05:12.750 --> 05:15.662
In the meantime,
let's talk about what we can agree on.

05:15.670 --> 05:17.285
Blindfold likely means one of two things.

05:17.290 --> 05:18.996
The UnSub might blindfold them initially

05:19.000 --> 05:21.412
if he's unsure of killing them
and wants to avoid detection.

05:21.420 --> 05:24.742
Exactly, but since we know the cab
driver couldn't have been blindfolded

05:24.750 --> 05:28.208
when he drove the UnSub,
we're looking at reason number two.

05:28.830 --> 05:32.709
Blindfolding a victim
suggests the UnSub feels remorse.

05:32.710 --> 05:37.374
Doesn't want his victims to look at him,
as he kills them.

05:39.210 --> 05:41.371
Nothing.

05:41.380 --> 05:43.871
It's been vacant for a couple of months.

05:43.880 --> 05:47.372
This train goes express
after midnight, it doesn't even stop here.

05:47.380 --> 05:50.281
He picked this spot beforehand.

05:50.290 --> 05:53.077
His last fare was logged
at an address on Church Street.

05:53.080 --> 05:54.616
Do you have any idea what's there?

05:54.620 --> 05:56.827
Church is an entry point from Brooklyn.

05:56.830 --> 05:58.957
There's a dive there
where the cabbies stop for coffee

05:58.960 --> 06:00.609
before the overnight shift.

06:00.620 --> 06:02.781
Explains how he got a cab.

06:05.750 --> 06:08.617
This guy is definitely not disorganized.

06:19.580 --> 06:22.788
Rachel Holman's change-of-address card.

06:22.790 --> 06:25.452
She'd just moved in.
Hadn't even filled it out yet.

06:25.460 --> 06:27.451
So she probably didn't know her neighbors

06:27.460 --> 06:29.451
and they weren't likely
to check in on her.

06:29.460 --> 06:31.826
Nope, and I also found this.

06:33.290 --> 06:35.576
It's a printout of AA meetings
in the area.

06:35.580 --> 06:36.990
She was starting a new life.

06:38.290 --> 06:40.667
Hey, you guys, check this out.

06:45.380 --> 06:47.496
The cops' theory is that she was home.

06:47.500 --> 06:50.116
That the UnSub broke in through
the front window and surprised her.

06:50.120 --> 06:53.453
But, look,
this is the gunshot to the chest.

06:53.460 --> 06:55.826
This is the knife to the head.

06:56.830 --> 06:59.242
So then after she was shot,

06:59.250 --> 07:01.241
she tried to run away from him,
toward the door.

07:01.250 --> 07:02.376
Exactly.

07:02.380 --> 07:04.996
He was already in the apartment
when she got home.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.413
The hallway is the only room in
the apartment with no windows.

07:08.420 --> 07:11.787
No one could see him,
so he just waited patiently.

07:13.330 --> 07:18.825
All right. So, she comes home,
and she opens the door.

07:18.830 --> 07:20.957
She walks in the hallway.

07:22.120 --> 07:27.069
She walks down and then,
bam, he shoots her right here.

07:27.080 --> 07:30.664
But she tries to run away,
and he's on her.

07:30.670 --> 07:32.661
So, why didn't he just shoot her again?

07:32.670 --> 07:35.070
Why stab her and break the blade off
in her head?

07:35.080 --> 07:36.661
Well, there are a number of possibilities.

07:36.670 --> 07:38.991
Through the ear
is the softest path to the brain.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.571
Snapping the handle's also common
in prison shankings.

07:41.580 --> 07:45.118
Break it off,
other guy can't pull the blade out.

07:45.120 --> 07:46.872
What's the other possibility?

07:46.880 --> 07:49.701
Lawrence Bittaker and Roy Norris
drove ice picks

07:49.710 --> 07:52.531
into their victims' heads
and broke off the handle.

07:52.540 --> 07:56.032
It's possible our UnSub
is sort of a serial killer groupie.

07:56.040 --> 07:59.453
So is this guy an ex-con or some
nut-job with an Amazon account?

07:59.460 --> 08:02.247
This particular UnSub
presents a mixed profile.

08:02.250 --> 08:04.957
No offense, but, then what good is it?

08:05.540 --> 08:09.112
The profile's just a starting point
for narrowing down the suspects.

08:09.120 --> 08:11.998
For instance, the fact that the UnSub
shoots his victims first,

08:12.000 --> 08:13.877
it suggests that he wants
a quick and effective means

08:13.880 --> 08:15.324
of controlling the situation.

08:15.330 --> 08:18.914
It's possible that he feels
he can't overpower his victims.

08:18.920 --> 08:21.616
It could be that he has a physical problem

08:21.620 --> 08:24.282
or that he's not confident
just because he's small.

08:24.290 --> 08:26.997
We now know
he has a high degree of organization.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.072
That, coupled with the fact
that he hunts at night,

08:30.080 --> 08:32.708
means he probably has a steady job.

08:33.580 --> 08:38.779
So, we're looking for a small,
angry, white guy with a day job?

08:38.790 --> 08:41.327
-Maybe it_'s Wilson.

08:41.330 --> 08:42.536
Cut it.

08:42.540 --> 08:45.418
No, no, it's all right, it's all right.
You're right.

08:45.420 --> 08:50.119
There's a lot we still don't know,
but we do know this,

08:50.120 --> 08:54.409
these are not blitz attacks.
They're too controlled.

08:54.420 --> 08:57.457
These are absolutely executions.

08:57.460 --> 08:58.950
An UnSub's signature

08:58.960 --> 09:02.498
is his own extremely rare combination
of MO and ritual.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.821
An UnSub kills to satisfy an inner need

09:04.830 --> 09:06.912
and will continue killing
until that inner need,

09:06.920 --> 09:09.536
which is based on a ritual,
is lived out perfectly.

09:09.540 --> 09:12.202
Because reality never lives up to fantasy,

09:12.210 --> 09:14.451
this becomes an impossibility.

09:14.460 --> 09:18.874
In other words, he's not gonna stop
killing until we catch him.

09:18.880 --> 09:22.828
Okay, hit the streets
and keep your head on a swivel.

09:22.830 --> 09:25.162
Thank you very much.

09:25.170 --> 09:26.910
Hi. Jennifer Jareau,
we spoke on the phone.

09:26.920 --> 09:28.160
-Detective Bennett.
-Agent Hotchner.

09:28.170 --> 09:29.956
Hello.

09:29.960 --> 09:31.871
So, I spoke to your point man.

09:31.880 --> 09:35.077
I reiterated how important it is to keep
the crime scene details under wraps,

09:35.080 --> 09:37.321
but it would go a long way
if it came out of your mouth, too.

09:37.330 --> 09:38.456
You got it.

09:38.460 --> 09:39.666
If this guy is who we think he is,

09:39.670 --> 09:42.662
we're talking terror like New York
hasn't seen since Son of Sam.

09:57.080 --> 09:58.707
May I help you?

10:04.830 --> 10:06.457
Are you okay?

10:43.830 --> 10:45.786
So, this is where terror starts.

10:45.790 --> 10:47.872
-How'd they find him?
-The night janitor.

10:47.880 --> 10:49.165
He see anything?

10:49.170 --> 10:51.741
No, but he remembered a parishioner
who was here earlier.

10:51.750 --> 10:53.615
-So we have a potential witness.
-Right there.

10:53.620 --> 10:54.746
This lady?
-Mmm-hmm.

10:54.750 --> 10:56.240
-Elle.
-Yeah.

10:58.540 --> 11:01.953
First public killing. Getting bolder, huh?

11:06.620 --> 11:11.319
Didn't let his surroundings alter
his method. He's meticulous.

11:11.330 --> 11:14.709
Presentation's every bit
as important as the kill.

11:16.210 --> 11:19.168
As soon as the police asked me
if I'd seen anything,

11:19.170 --> 11:20.740
I had a sickly feeling.

11:20.750 --> 11:23.116
-So you saw him?
-Not his face.

11:23.120 --> 11:26.578
He had a hood on,
and he kept his head down.

11:26.580 --> 11:28.741
But something about his behavior
unsettled you?

11:28.750 --> 11:30.411
I'm sorry. I should have known.

11:30.420 --> 11:34.322
There is no way that someone
could know something like this.

11:34.330 --> 11:37.037
It almost felt like he couldn't hear me.

11:37.040 --> 11:39.668
Like he was in his own world, you know?

11:39.670 --> 11:43.117
-You spoke to him?
-I just asked if he was okay.

11:43.120 --> 11:45.918
-And he didn't speak?
-He didn't even look up.

11:45.920 --> 11:48.161
I couldn't stop watching his hands.

11:49.170 --> 11:54.574
They were moving like he was playing
a piano or fingering a rosary maybe...

11:55.830 --> 11:57.536
He could have killed me.

11:57.540 --> 12:01.078
Unless he's not killing at random.

12:01.080 --> 12:04.117
And whatever these people have
in common's what got them killed.

12:12.710 --> 12:17.454
I'm sorry. Would it be possible to
maybe slide that thing out of his ear?

12:23.000 --> 12:27.039
I thought maybe he was uncomfortable
being in this parish.

12:27.040 --> 12:31.454
-Why would he be uncomfortable?
-Because of all that business.

12:31.460 --> 12:34.202
A year ago,
the rector was indicted for pedophilia.

12:34.210 --> 12:36.576
A lot of people stopped worshiping here,

12:36.580 --> 12:40.038
but Father Breeman was tried in
a court of law and found innocent.

12:40.040 --> 12:42.110
It's not my place to question that.

12:42.120 --> 12:45.533
He's not using just any knife.
It's made of flint.

12:45.540 --> 12:46.780
As in stone?

12:46.790 --> 12:50.419
In Egyptian mythology, flint was the
symbol for protection and retribution.

12:50.420 --> 12:51.956
With hieroglyphics, they used to depict

12:51.960 --> 12:53.109
-dangerous animals...
-Excuse me.

12:53.120 --> 12:55.611
...like scorpions and snakes
being cut with flint knives

12:55.620 --> 12:58.202
in order to render them powerless.

13:15.000 --> 13:18.663
-Anything strike you as strange?
-Well, blood's all on the inside.

13:24.750 --> 13:27.207
Font of all knowledge. Check my flow.

13:27.210 --> 13:28.495
I need you to check all the victims

13:28.500 --> 13:30.616
and see if any were ever charged
with a crime.

13:30.620 --> 13:33.783
Okay. You want to time me or
should I just dazzle you off the clock?

13:35.380 --> 13:39.248
Okay, Kaveh Surrani.
Vehicular manslaughter.

13:39.250 --> 13:42.162
Tried and found not guilty July 2002.

13:42.170 --> 13:45.378
Rachel Holman. Convicted of
cocaine possessmn, 2004.

13:45.380 --> 13:47.371
Oh, baby girl, just say no.

13:47.380 --> 13:48.995
No acquittals?

13:49.000 --> 13:51.036
No, wait. Hold on. Same case.

13:51.040 --> 13:52.917
She was also up on charges
for administering

13:52.920 --> 13:55.957
a fatal close of heroin to her boyfriend.

13:55.960 --> 13:59.748
Jury found her not guilty.
Can we go three for three?

13:59.750 --> 14:04.528
Yahtzee. Our cabbie, Walter Derbin.
Spousal battery. Bastard.

14:04.540 --> 14:06.826
-But he was innocent?-If you want to call it that.

14:06.830 --> 14:09.037
Charges were dropped mid-trial,
four months ago.

14:09.040 --> 14:10.246
You're a genius.

14:10.250 --> 14:12.161
You're just saying that 'cause it's true.

14:12.170 --> 14:13.319
Thanks.

14:13.330 --> 14:14.911
The victim was blindfolded first,

14:14.920 --> 14:16.876
the blood would have flowed
over the blindfold.

14:16.880 --> 14:19.166
He puts it on after he kills them.

14:19.170 --> 14:22.242
All three charged with a felony,
all three found innocent.

14:22.250 --> 14:24.411
And that didn't show up
on your man's radar?

14:24.420 --> 14:26.661
Acquittals? No.

14:26.670 --> 14:30.208
-Why is it important?
-Because we have a new profile.

14:33.290 --> 14:35.611
We now believe these killings
aren't random.

14:35.620 --> 14:38.453
We might be dealing with a vigilante.

14:38.460 --> 14:42.248
UnSub first shoots his victims
in order to subdue them.

14:42.250 --> 14:47.916
Flint knife then provides both an
efficient kill and symbolic retribution.

14:47.920 --> 14:53.074
Finally, the victim is blindfolded,
like the statue of Lady Justice.

14:54.330 --> 14:58.915
This particular UnSub,
he displays both a heightened, he's...

14:58.920 --> 15:03.539
It's actually almost a poetic sense
of right and wrong.

15:03.540 --> 15:05.747
Serial vigilantes are extremely rare.

15:05.750 --> 15:07.911
The exaggerated drama of these killings

15:07.920 --> 15:10.707
suggests that they're somehow personal.

15:11.580 --> 15:15.949
_He or someone close _to him _
was likely the Victim of a Violent crime.

15:15.960 --> 15:20.329
His first killing was possibly
against his original attacker.

15:20.330 --> 15:23.413
And since then he's developed
an overblown sense of justice

15:23.420 --> 15:25.957
in order to justify
that killing to himself.

15:25.960 --> 15:28.747
Because he chooses
the imagery of Lady Justice,

15:28.750 --> 15:30.570
it's possible we're dealing with someone

15:30.580 --> 15:34.164
who_w_orks_in or around
the criminal justice system.

15:34.170 --> 15:37.913
Lawyer, paralegal, bailiff, even a judge.

15:37.920 --> 15:40.616
We'll crosscheck unsolved murders

15:40.620 --> 15:46.115
against suspects in assault cases
and victims who work in the system.

15:46.120 --> 15:47.496
Whatever the UnSub's job,

15:47.500 --> 15:50.207
he's someone who's a cog in the machine.

15:50.210 --> 15:52.531
He's overworked, undervalued.

15:53.710 --> 15:56.110
He's used to not being noticed.

15:56.120 --> 16:00.113
His sense of theatrics is a way
to enhance his own self-esteem.

16:00.120 --> 16:03.669
Convince himself he has a higher purpose,

16:03.670 --> 16:07.208
but he also knows
that people look right through him.

16:19.420 --> 16:22.617
Being faceless is his best defense
against detection.

16:23.750 --> 16:26.207
He's everyone.

16:26.210 --> 16:28.952
One last thing,
we need you to close ranks.

16:28.960 --> 16:31.747
The more details slip out,
the more he'll feed off it.

16:31.750 --> 16:32.876
We don't want him believing

16:32.880 --> 16:35.166
he's captured the public's fear
or imagination.

16:35.170 --> 16:36.910
Too late.

16:36.920 --> 16:39.536
The afternoon edition's
leading with the vigilante story.

16:39.540 --> 16:41.576
-How did they get it?
-I don't know.

16:43.460 --> 16:47.908
You were worried about this guy
becoming another Son of Sam.

16:47.920 --> 16:52.459
Now we might be dealing with a
vigilante folk hero like Bernhard Goetz.

16:57.540 --> 17:01.704
So you know there was a big hole in
the profile you presented back there.

17:01.710 --> 17:03.996
Can you pass the moo shu, please?

17:04.000 --> 17:05.740
What's the hole?

17:05.750 --> 17:08.412
I left out the possibility
our UnSub might be a cop.

17:08.420 --> 17:10.411
Well, they do know the system.

17:10.420 --> 17:12.570
They're definitely
overworked and underpaid.

17:12.580 --> 17:14.286
They see so much injustice every day

17:14.290 --> 17:16.326
they can easily take matters
into their own hands.

17:16.330 --> 17:18.161
When someone like our victim is killed,

17:18.170 --> 17:22.288
police refer to the murder
as a public service murder.

17:22.290 --> 17:25.612
You know how many rapists I saw walk
during my Sex Crime clays?

17:25.620 --> 17:28.077
And either the victims,
they didn't want to press charges,

17:28.080 --> 17:31.868
or the juries they said
that she was asking for it.

17:31.880 --> 17:33.700
It was enough to make you explode.

17:33.710 --> 17:36.952
Well, it's a long way from feeling like
that and actually committing murder.

17:36.960 --> 17:38.951
-Don't you think?
-Oh, not really.

17:38.960 --> 17:40.951
Excuse me, could I get a fork, perhaps?

17:40.960 --> 17:42.166
Su_re.

17:43.670 --> 17:45.570
Did you know that experts credit Confucius

17:45.580 --> 17:47.571
with the advent of the chopstick?

17:47.580 --> 17:49.491
He equated knives with acts of aggression.

17:49.500 --> 17:50.876
You don't know how to use them, do you?

17:50.880 --> 17:54.532
It's like trying to forage for dinner
with a pair of number two pencils.

17:54.540 --> 17:56.246
Okay, here let me help you.

17:56.250 --> 17:58.457
Oh, the rubber band trick.
-Yeah, the rubber band trick.

17:58.460 --> 18:01.577
Well, New York City cops do have
a lot of pressure on them.

18:01.580 --> 18:03.320
Every move they make gets scrutinized.

18:03.330 --> 18:06.572
One of the first cases of
criminal profiling happened

18:06.580 --> 18:10.459
when a New York City cop
asked a criminal psychiatrist friend

18:10.460 --> 18:12.075
to help with the Mad Bomber case.

18:12.080 --> 18:14.822
The Mad Bomber was a major
inspiration for the Unabomber.

18:14.830 --> 18:17.617
He eluded cops in New York
for 16 years, starting in 1940,

18:17.620 --> 18:19.781
but he kept his promise
and never set off a single bomb

18:19.790 --> 18:21.109
during the Second World War.

18:21.120 --> 18:25.784
Psychiatrist James Brussels,
he developed a profile so accurate,

18:25.790 --> 18:28.418
he predicted that
when they caught the Bomber,

18:28.420 --> 18:31.821
he'd be wearing a double-breasted suit
and it would be buttoned.

18:31.830 --> 18:34.663
You guys, we're here in New York

18:34.670 --> 18:36.786
and even when we're not talking
about our case,

18:36.790 --> 18:38.951
we end up talking about another profiler.

18:38.960 --> 18:42.919
You're right.
So, Elle, are you seeing anyone?

18:45.750 --> 18:50.449
Gideon, why didn't you tell the cops
that it might be one of their own?

18:51.210 --> 18:55.874
If we're gonna catch the guy, we need
all the help the cops can give us.

18:56.710 --> 18:59.873
Last thing I wanna do
is accuse one of them of murder.

19:12.290 --> 19:13.609
Murder.

19:13.620 --> 19:14.826
Kill.

19:21.880 --> 19:24.280
How's it going there?
-Awesome.

19:25.290 --> 19:26.575
Gideon.

19:27.540 --> 19:29.076
It's absolutely incredible,

19:29.080 --> 19:32.493
1.3 billion people
stay nourished using these things.

19:32.500 --> 19:34.411
Yeah. Okay. I got it.

19:36.080 --> 19:37.991
He just took out a cop-killer.

19:53.380 --> 19:55.325
His name's Shawn Cooley.

19:55.330 --> 19:59.289
One year ago he killed two
Port Authority cops and he walked,

19:59.290 --> 20:00.917
because the only witness against him

20:00.920 --> 20:04.458
was shot six times outside his apartment.

20:04.460 --> 20:07.497
Might be worth having your men
re-canvass this morning.

20:07.500 --> 20:10.822
People are more likely to talk in the day.

20:10.830 --> 20:12.036
They feel safer.

20:12.040 --> 20:13.200
I'm already on it.

20:13.210 --> 20:15.417
More bad news.

20:15.420 --> 20:17.115
It's the same reporter every time.

20:17.120 --> 20:20.112
Lance Wagner.
He's practically deifying him.

20:20.120 --> 20:22.782
I'm not even happy with the results
when God plays God.

20:22.790 --> 20:24.075
You know, a few of the men were talking

20:24.080 --> 20:26.878
about making him
a wish list of other dirtbags.

20:26.880 --> 20:30.327
"Someday a real rain will come and
wash all the scum off the streets."

20:30.330 --> 20:31.706
Taxi Driver.

20:31.710 --> 20:33.075
This town loves a psychopath.

20:33.080 --> 20:35.036
Why hasn't he contacted the press yet?

20:35.040 --> 20:37.031
Reid's right.

20:37.040 --> 20:39.326
He's got the symbolism,
the inflated sense of duty.

20:39.330 --> 20:43.118
-He should be seeking out acclaim.
-Maybe it's not about acclaim with him.

20:43.120 --> 20:45.327
He's on a mission.
Maybe it's about the work.

20:45.330 --> 20:48.322
Yeah, but the last two cases were
a cop-killer and a pedophile priest.

20:48.330 --> 20:51.037
-Those are higher-profile cases.
-He's getting more confident.

20:51.040 --> 20:54.919
He's growing into his role
as the city's judge and executioner.

20:54.920 --> 20:58.162
I'll check the press archives
for controversial acquittals.

20:58.170 --> 21:00.320
Maybe we can target the victim
before the UnSub.

21:00.330 --> 21:02.742
Oh, good.

21:02.750 --> 21:06.208
Hey, guys, listen to
what came off the tip hotline.

21:07.080 --> 21:09.378
I got a tip. Let the guy be.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.912
How come
the NYPD wants to catch this guy?

21:12.920 --> 21:16.538
Are you jealous
he's doing the job better than you?

21:16.540 --> 21:19.111
-It goes on for half an hour.
-He's a hero.

21:19.120 --> 21:22.032
The exact same thing happened with
the Goetz New York subway shooting

21:22.040 --> 21:23.746
-in the early '805.
-You weren't even born.

21:23.750 --> 21:24.990
I read a lot.

21:28.580 --> 21:29.911
Hey. Talk to me, baby.

21:29.920 --> 21:31.205
Who do you love?

21:31.210 --> 21:32.450
Well, that depends on
what you're giving me.

21:32.460 --> 21:34.371
Don't be such a man.

21:34.380 --> 21:36.530
I ran the names of the five victims
like you asked.

21:36.540 --> 21:40.078
No overlap in arresting officers,
public defenders, or district attorney.

21:40.500 --> 21:42.377
-Do I sense a "but?"
-Small "but."

21:42.380 --> 21:44.666
That's not what I was jonesing for.

21:44.670 --> 21:46.456
Mmm. You're killing me with entendres,

21:46.460 --> 21:49.827
but each one was processed
at the Manhattan Criminal Courthouse

21:49.830 --> 21:51.206
at 100 Centre Street.

21:51.210 --> 21:53.781
Do you have any idea how many cases
run through there every year?

21:53.790 --> 21:59.319
122,998, but, at least,
we've eliminated four other boroughs.

21:59.330 --> 22:02.322
Yeah, great. All right.
It's a start. Thanks.

22:02.330 --> 22:03.911
Hmm. Ta.

22:04.620 --> 22:06.110
Do you have any idea how many cases...

22:06.120 --> 22:09.374
122,998 cases a year.

22:09.380 --> 22:11.280
We'll check it out.

22:11.290 --> 22:13.417
Maybe there's someone with a history
of erratic behavior

22:13.420 --> 22:15.320
who worked in the building.

22:15.330 --> 22:19.164
Crime groupies.
Security guard that fits the profile.

22:19.170 --> 22:21.240
Get with JJ. See what you can make of
her case list.

22:21.250 --> 22:23.491
-Okay.
-I'll go with you.

22:31.920 --> 22:33.660
Ever crossed your mind?

22:33.670 --> 22:36.571
-Taking the law into my own hands?
-Not the law, justice.

22:36.580 --> 22:38.878
What's this about

22:38.880 --> 22:40.700
It's just a question.

22:40.710 --> 22:42.496
I guess I think
ifI ever let my mind go there,

22:42.500 --> 22:44.161
then the UnSubs would be getting
into my head

22:44.170 --> 22:45.956
instead of me getting into theirs.

22:45.960 --> 22:48.702
That wouldn't be a good idea,
now would it?

22:52.000 --> 22:55.743
The cops have already been down here
asking their questions.

22:55.750 --> 22:57.991
I just wanted to give you a description
of someone,

22:58.000 --> 23:00.161
see if he sounds familiar.

23:01.170 --> 23:03.161
He's quiet, he...

23:03.170 --> 23:05.957
Body language gives the impression
he's seen too much.

23:05.960 --> 23:09.703
Work in this building long enough,
we all get that way.

23:11.120 --> 23:12.951
You might not notice him at first
but when you do,

23:12.960 --> 23:15.281
you realize
he's heard everything around him.

23:15.290 --> 23:17.281
He might have had a personal brush
with crime.

23:17.290 --> 23:19.076
When it happened,
he talked about it all the time,

23:19.080 --> 23:21.241
but now you realize
he hasn't mentioned it in quite a while.

23:21.250 --> 23:24.162
And when the subject of the vigilante
comes up, he expresses his support,

23:24.170 --> 23:26.957
but it's not something he would
bring up in conversation himself.

23:26.960 --> 23:28.416
Well, if people are being honest with you,

23:28.420 --> 23:30.741
that's most of the people
in this building.

23:30.750 --> 23:33.571
-How old are you?
-24.

23:33.580 --> 23:35.070
I'll give you six years.

23:35.080 --> 23:38.072
That point, a tiny part of your brain
will be asking

23:38.080 --> 23:41.493
if what this guy's doing
isn't the right way to go.

23:58.830 --> 24:01.116
-Anything

24:01.120 --> 24:02.246
No.

24:04.080 --> 24:05.616
What happened in Iowa?

24:09.420 --> 24:14.665
It was one of the first cases
Hotch and I worked together.

24:14.670 --> 24:18.322
Small town, two boys had
been murdered, same signature.

24:19.460 --> 24:23.533
Profile led us to the local 4-H leader.

24:23.540 --> 24:26.077
We went to interview him, the guy,
he was suicidal.

24:26.080 --> 24:28.162
He had a shotgun. Our guns were drawn.

24:28.170 --> 24:32.413
And at some point,
he turns the shotgun on Hotch,

24:32.420 --> 24:34.320
but instead of firing,
Hotch talks him down.

24:34.330 --> 24:35.877
The guy surrenders.

24:35.880 --> 24:37.495
Sounds like pretty good work.

24:39.120 --> 24:42.704
At trial, the guy's wife gave him an alibi
for both murders.

24:42.710 --> 24:45.452
Small town, they all knew each other.
Jurors believed her.

24:47.210 --> 24:49.610
Eventually they got him
when he killed another boy.

24:53.830 --> 24:55.206
Any luck?

25:02.620 --> 25:04.827
This guy's not doing us any favors.

25:04.830 --> 25:08.243
His access is unbelievable.
He's practically scooping us.

25:12.380 --> 25:15.577
The FBI needs help, and they get you
to do their bidding?

25:15.580 --> 25:18.117
I am an FBI Special Agent.

25:18.120 --> 25:20.327
The rest of the team is too busy.
They're out on the field.

25:20.330 --> 25:23.379
Yeah, and they're doing
a bang-up job, too.

25:30.880 --> 25:34.611
Look, the fact is, you've scooped
every other reporter in New York.

25:34.620 --> 25:36.997
You've even managed to be ahead
of the cops a few times.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.070
A good crime reporter needs
to be better than the police.

25:39.080 --> 25:40.286
You got less to go on.

25:40.290 --> 25:41.609
Well, that's why Agent Gideon was hoping

25:41.620 --> 25:44.202
you'd accept this invitation to help.

25:44.210 --> 25:45.950
-Jason Gideon?
-Mmm-hmm.

25:47.960 --> 25:50.667
-He used to be one of the best.
-He still is.

25:50.670 --> 25:52.706
Yeah, he had, kind of, a famous meltdown.

25:52.710 --> 25:54.871
And a whole string of successes
since he's returned.

25:54.880 --> 25:57.280
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Meltdowns make better copy.

25:57.290 --> 25:59.747
Well, maybe you can take that up
with him, yourself.

25:59.750 --> 26:02.378
You know, if you decide to come in.

26:03.250 --> 26:06.162
So, how did you put together
the vigilante angle so quickly?

26:06.170 --> 26:08.286
I covered the original trials
of all the victims.

26:08.290 --> 26:09.450
Must have a good memory.

26:09.460 --> 26:12.327
A lot of killers can't remember details
from their own crimes.

26:12.330 --> 26:14.571
Some cases just stick right in your brain.

26:14.580 --> 26:15.877
Tell us about the victims.

26:15.880 --> 26:18.417
All right, well, this girl,
she was just a waste case.

26:18.420 --> 26:22.379
The jury bought into the whole
addiction-as-disease BS.

26:22.380 --> 26:25.247
And this old guy, he was a thug.

26:25.250 --> 26:28.913
He beat his wife, but the case fell apart
because she wouldn't testify.

26:28.920 --> 26:31.616
-Surrani?
-He drank and drove.

26:31.620 --> 26:33.247
It was a tragedy,

26:33.250 --> 26:35.616
but it was the kind of thing that could
happen to anybody, so...

26:35.620 --> 26:37.918
So, who do you think we're looking for

26:37.920 --> 26:40.536
My guess is he's a crime victim.

26:40.540 --> 26:43.498
-Probably something violent.
-But you do think he's a hero?

26:43.500 --> 26:46.879
Well, you know, this city
makes you swallow a lot of crap.

26:46.880 --> 26:49.667
It's hard not to feel for someone
who won't take it any more.

26:49.670 --> 26:51.991
These haven't been released
to the press. They're pretty grim.

26:52.000 --> 26:55.492
Well, I've seen plenty of crime scenes.

26:55.500 --> 26:57.741
-Right.
-Yeah.

26:57.750 --> 26:59.286
Huh?

26:59.290 --> 27:01.326
We're stuck on the ear.

27:01.880 --> 27:05.077
Is it for killing efficiency or symbolism?

27:07.540 --> 27:10.498
Why would you stab someone
through the ear into their brain?

27:15.710 --> 27:16.950
What's going on here?

27:16.960 --> 27:18.575
The profile leads us to think that

27:18.580 --> 27:20.457
he works close
to the criminal justice system.

27:20.460 --> 27:22.917
-What do you think?
-Oh, no, no.

27:22.920 --> 27:25.878
You didn't bring me in here
because you wanted my help.

27:25.880 --> 27:29.077
Profile suggests this guy'd
contact the media. He hasn't.

27:29.080 --> 27:31.412
And we thought the killer
wouldn't need to contact the press

27:31.420 --> 27:32.739
if he were the press.

27:32.750 --> 27:35.617
You're single-handedly turning
this psychopath into a folk hero.

27:35.620 --> 27:36.780
So what happened?

27:36.790 --> 27:38.451
You get your men killed on the job

27:38.460 --> 27:40.325
and you think everybody else
must be a killer, too?

27:40.330 --> 27:42.321
-Watch your mouth.
-It's okay, Hotch.

27:43.670 --> 27:44.819
Not our guy.

27:44.830 --> 27:48.573
Damn right. I didn't kill anybody.
What about you?

27:48.580 --> 27:52.323
Wagner. You're right.
You're not the killer.

27:52.330 --> 27:53.570
Mmm-hmm.

27:54.210 --> 27:57.373
Everything you feel is vicarious.
You don't have it in you to act.

27:59.080 --> 28:01.878
This psycho's the last chance for you.

28:01.880 --> 28:03.666
You've screwed up other jobs.
You drank too much.

28:03.670 --> 28:05.490
You probably have
a broken marriage or two.

28:05.500 --> 28:08.242
You're actually hoping
he doesn't get caught for a while.

28:08.250 --> 28:10.115
That part of you knows
that's twisted and pathetic,

28:10.120 --> 28:12.782
but, hey, just reporting the news, right?

28:37.460 --> 28:38.609
Hey.

28:39.500 --> 28:40.660
Hey!

29:02.250 --> 29:04.070
The reporter is not our vigilante.

29:04.080 --> 29:05.786
Yeah, we know. How do you know?

29:05.790 --> 29:07.451
There was just another shooting
in Central Park.

29:07.460 --> 29:09.371
You say shooting,
what about the rest of the signature?

29:09.380 --> 29:12.372
Officers heard the shot,
but he ran off before they got there.

29:13.580 --> 29:16.117
The victim was an undercover cop.

29:17.080 --> 29:18.786
I think you're looking for me.

29:20.790 --> 29:22.997
-Put the gun on the ground!
-On your knees!

29:23.000 --> 29:25.457
-On your knees right now!
-Drop the gun!

29:25.460 --> 29:29.032
Get down! Don't move!

29:29.040 --> 29:31.281
No, you don't understand.

29:31.290 --> 29:34.748
I did this all for you.
We're in this together.

29:41.460 --> 29:42.700
Name's Will Sykes.

29:42.710 --> 29:44.780
He's a security guard
at a boutique in SoHo.

29:44.790 --> 29:47.873
He was a mugging victim last year.
Spent two days in intensive care.

29:47.880 --> 29:49.324
Fits the profile.

29:49.330 --> 29:53.164
-How's it going in here?
-He just confessed to all the murders.

29:54.290 --> 29:58.454
-So, what were you doing in the park?
-It's full of animals.

29:58.460 --> 30:01.873
Muggers, scum, drug dealers.

30:01.880 --> 30:04.246
I knew one of them
would try to prey on me.

30:04.250 --> 30:07.413
That's not your usual method.

30:07.420 --> 30:09.957
I mean, you target them.
You don't let them target you.

30:09.960 --> 30:12.281
I made that point.
Now I'm making this one.

30:12.290 --> 30:13.666
Which is?

30:14.830 --> 30:19.039
If you hunt us on the street,
you will die the way you lived.

30:22.540 --> 30:24.496
So, why turn yourself in now?

30:24.500 --> 30:27.992
I can't change this city without help.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.707
People need to be inspired.

30:30.710 --> 30:33.998
They need to see me.
They need to hear my voice.

30:35.540 --> 30:37.826
Can you tell me about the cab driver,
Derbin?

30:37.830 --> 30:40.492
He was a thug. A wife beater.

30:40.500 --> 30:42.115
And the priest?

30:43.210 --> 30:46.702
What's to know? He preyed on young boys.

30:46.710 --> 30:48.871
Is that why you stabbed him in the groin?

30:48.880 --> 30:50.825
It's what he deserved.

30:53.580 --> 30:54.990
-Thank you.
-Mmm-hmm.

31:01.330 --> 31:03.878
Why would he confess to murders
he didn't commit?

31:03.880 --> 31:05.666
Because he has narcissistic delusions.

31:05.670 --> 31:08.036
He wants the glory. He wants to be a star.

31:08.040 --> 31:11.703
He went into the park hoping that
somebody would mess with him.

31:11.710 --> 31:14.110
He killed your undercover cop,
but not the others.

31:14.120 --> 31:15.610
So, where does that leave us?

31:15.620 --> 31:18.828
We know our UnSub has
a heightened sense of right and wrong.

31:18.830 --> 31:23.244
If he knew that he inspired a would-be
vigilante to murder an undercover cop,

31:23.250 --> 31:24.660
he might feel remorse.

31:24.670 --> 31:26.069
Do you think you might be able
to mend fences

31:26.080 --> 31:28.162
with the reporter, Wagner?

31:28.170 --> 31:30.456
If it played to his ego, yeah.

31:30.460 --> 31:31.950
Well, we might be able
to draw the UnSub out.

31:31.960 --> 31:33.746
That's a good one.

31:47.960 --> 31:49.996
Wagner said, this morning,
that the cop's blood

31:50.000 --> 31:52.571
is all over the vigilante's hands.

31:52.580 --> 31:55.037
How did JJ get him to cooperate?

31:56.620 --> 31:59.453
UnSub might feel a need to be there,

31:59.460 --> 32:03.032
physically mourn for what he caused.

32:03.040 --> 32:06.828
If that article lures him, Wagner gets
to claim he caught a murderer.

32:06.830 --> 32:08.878
It's the ultimate scoop.

32:09.750 --> 32:12.241
I briefed your men.

32:12.250 --> 32:13.740
If the UnSub's there, he'll be alone,

32:13.750 --> 32:16.571
out of place, not speaking to anyone else,

32:16.580 --> 32:18.821
probably not even making eye contact.

32:20.080 --> 32:23.993
Hopefully, he'll panic,
draw attention on himself.

32:27.000 --> 32:30.663
I can never get that sound out of my head.

32:30.670 --> 32:33.571
It wakes me in the middle of the night.

32:33.580 --> 32:36.037
If there was any justice,

32:36.040 --> 32:38.952
cop-killers would have to hear it
for an eternity.

32:43.330 --> 32:44.490
Hotchner.

32:44.500 --> 32:46.661
Hey, Hotch. Hotch, it's Morgan.

32:46.670 --> 32:49.787
Thank you. Listen, something's funlq, man.

32:49.790 --> 32:52.918
I'm here trying to get transcripts
from the victims' original trials.

32:52.920 --> 32:55.741
I thought maybe there could have
been a disturbance at the courthouse,

32:55.750 --> 32:57.240
or maybe the UnSub
even made himself known.

32:57.250 --> 32:59.161
-You know what I mean?-Yeah.

32:59.170 --> 33:00.319
Okay, well here's the thing.

33:00.330 --> 33:03.072
There are no records available yet
from the cabbie's trial.

33:03.080 --> 33:05.162
The clerk told me
that your average court reporter

33:05.170 --> 33:07.616
_ is three-to-six months
behind in transcribing his notes.

33:08.000 --> 33:10.491
That means that anyone who knows
the details of that case

33:10.500 --> 33:11.740
had to have been in the courtroom.

33:11.750 --> 33:13.320
Court reporters
take their work home with them.

33:13.330 --> 33:15.457
They get paid overtime.
They take their notes in court

33:15.460 --> 33:16.609
and finish transcribing them at night.

33:16.620 --> 33:17.780
You know what Bennett said about

33:17.790 --> 33:21.078
not being able to get the sound
of bagpipes out of her head.

33:21.080 --> 33:23.207
Maybe that's why the UnSub stabs the ears.

33:23.210 --> 33:24.996
Killers often harm their victims in ways

33:25.000 --> 33:26.820
that they themselves have been harmed.

33:26.830 --> 33:29.378
A court reporter is by definition
a faceless cog in the machine.

33:29.380 --> 33:31.746
He sits there, day in, day out,
transcribing testimony.

33:31.750 --> 33:35.459
Well, what if the voices wouldn't stop
when you left the courtroom?

33:35.460 --> 33:39.749
The witness in the church said that the
UnSub was doing a piano-like motion.

33:39.750 --> 33:40.990
Or transcribing.

33:41.000 --> 33:43.412
Killing's a good way
to get the voices to stop, huh?

33:44.540 --> 33:45.666
Holla.

33:45.670 --> 33:47.285
I need the name of the court stenographer

33:47.290 --> 33:49.281
in each of the victims' original trials.

33:52.120 --> 33:54.247
Same one every time. Marvin Doyle.

33:54.250 --> 33:55.660
Crosscheck him against crime records.

33:55.670 --> 33:58.116
See if he was ever the victim
of a Violent crime.

33:58.120 --> 33:59.701
No, not him.

34:00.080 --> 34:02.878
His parents,
killed in an attempted robbery, '04.

34:02.880 --> 34:04.700
That's his stressor. Is he still working?

34:05.500 --> 34:07.536
100 Centre, Courtroom 103.

34:07.540 --> 34:08.996
We got him.

34:13.750 --> 34:15.911
Marvin Doyle. Is that him?

34:16.710 --> 34:18.575
Doyle called in sick.

34:27.120 --> 34:29.782
-We were in this courtroom yesterday.
-He saw us.

34:29.790 --> 34:32.827
Tell your judge I need a warrant.
Take that.

34:39.210 --> 34:41.826
Marvin Doyle? FBI. Open up.

34:49.120 --> 34:50.371
Clear!

34:53.670 --> 34:54.876
Clear.

35:00.540 --> 35:02.872
Trying to keep the voices out.

35:10.540 --> 35:12.917
Soundproofed the entire place.

35:20.040 --> 35:22.372
He ripped the speakers out of
the television and the radio.

35:22.380 --> 35:27.158
And here is a life insurance check
for $250,000.

35:27.170 --> 35:29.957
It's two years old. He didn't cash it.

35:31.580 --> 35:33.707
Won't accept blood money.

35:41.710 --> 35:45.919
Here's a box full of flint knives.
There's got to be 100 of them.

35:49.120 --> 35:51.918
Guys, come take a look at this.

35:53.500 --> 35:56.742
It's a stenography machine,
but look at the keys.

35:56.750 --> 35:58.661
They're all worn out.

35:59.750 --> 36:02.162
It's like he was trying to transcribe
the voices in his head

36:02.170 --> 36:03.785
but couldn't keep up.

36:03.790 --> 36:05.610
It looks like hieroglyphics.

36:05.620 --> 36:06.826
It's called steno.

36:06.830 --> 36:09.788
It's basically a phonetic series
of syllables.

36:09.790 --> 36:11.530
No court reporter
takes notes the same way,

36:11.540 --> 36:13.997
so no one can translate them
but the reporter himself.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.412
He's getting paid overtime
to study potential victims.

36:16.420 --> 36:18.877
He knows we're on to him.
He's racmg us now.

36:18.880 --> 36:21.826
Someone in these boxes is targeted to die.

36:23.380 --> 36:27.373
We need to get inside his head and
figure out who, so we can stop him.

36:27.380 --> 36:29.450
Let's go. Start fishing.

36:35.790 --> 36:36.996
You know, this is a lot of boxes,

36:37.000 --> 36:38.661
how are we supposed to narrow it down?

36:38.670 --> 36:41.821
Check and see if it ended in acquittal.
If it didn't, toss it aside.

36:41.830 --> 36:43.457
It has to be a capital case.

36:43.460 --> 36:45.325
He's escalating.
The more brutal the better.

36:45.330 --> 36:46.706
Why not go by most recent?

36:46.710 --> 36:48.325
Judging by his elaborate filing system,

36:48.330 --> 36:50.616
Doyle, obviously,
has obsessive-compulsive disorder.

36:50.620 --> 36:52.372
People with OCD often finish tasks

36:52.380 --> 36:54.075
and then go back to the beginning
and start over.

36:54.080 --> 36:55.536
So he continually goes
through the transcripts

36:55.540 --> 36:57.576
and the first one to trigger him
becomes his next victim.

36:57.580 --> 36:58.706
Here's one.

36:58.710 --> 37:01.110
This is a liquor store owner
who was shot with his own gun.

37:01.120 --> 37:02.781
Flip to when they present the defense.

37:02.790 --> 37:04.451
-Did the defendant testify?
-No.

37:04.460 --> 37:06.325
Stick with the ones
where the accused took the stand.

37:06.330 --> 37:07.490
This is personal. He hears their voices.

37:07.500 --> 37:08.706
Okay.

37:08.710 --> 37:12.612
Doyle's victims all claimed to be
a type of victim themselves.

37:12.620 --> 37:14.702
First two threw themselves
on the mercy of the court,

37:14.710 --> 37:16.575
pleading alcohol and drug-dependency.

37:16.580 --> 37:19.378
The priest said he was a victim,
victim of recent hysteria.

37:19.380 --> 37:20.495
Look for key phrases.

37:20.500 --> 37:22.115
Victim, mercy, anything that signifies

37:22.120 --> 37:23.417
they thought their crime
wasn't their fault.

37:23.420 --> 37:25.285
I think I might have one, guys.
Ted Elmore.

37:25.290 --> 37:26.666
He shot and killed both his parents

37:26.670 --> 37:28.956
after claiming self-defense
for years of physical abuse.

37:28.960 --> 37:30.075
Doyle lost his own parents.

37:30.080 --> 37:32.878
Hearing someone get away with killing
their own, that would haunt him.

37:52.120 --> 37:54.532
-Hello.
-Is Ted Elmore there?

37:54.540 --> 37:57.452
-Not right now. Can I take a message

37:57.460 --> 37:59.075
This is his wife. Who's this?

37:59.080 --> 38:01.241
My name is Jason Gideon, I'm with the FBI.

38:18.750 --> 38:21.571
Honey, the FBI is on the phone.

38:24.790 --> 38:28.374
Mrs Elmore

38:28.380 --> 38:29.608
Come on.

38:29.960 --> 38:31.700
Let's go.
OFFICER2: Move!

38:34.000 --> 38:35.820
All right, move in.

38:40.960 --> 38:42.200
He's in there.

38:44.080 --> 38:45.490
I think I can talk him out.

38:45.500 --> 38:46.956
I have snipers up high.

38:46.960 --> 38:50.953
If they get a clean shot,
they have my order to take it.

38:50.960 --> 38:53.611
Well, we might be able to reason.

38:53.620 --> 38:56.032
We rushed him.

38:56.040 --> 38:59.498
He doesn't want to
have an innocent hostage.

38:59.500 --> 39:01.411
He has an exaggerated sense
of right and wrong.

39:01.420 --> 39:03.285
And so do I.

39:03.290 --> 39:06.032
Talking's worth a shot.

39:06.040 --> 39:07.576
I'm coming with you.

39:15.580 --> 39:19.414
-Shut up!
-He didn't do anything to you.

39:20.620 --> 39:22.827
Tell her how you lied.

39:22.830 --> 39:27.608
Tell her how you killed your parents
and pretended they'd been hurting you.

39:27.960 --> 39:29.666
They did hurt me.

39:32.330 --> 39:33.536
I'll kill him.

39:33.540 --> 39:36.111
Then you wouldn't get to hear the truth.

39:37.670 --> 39:42.573
If he admits the truth,
the voices'll stop, right?

39:42.580 --> 39:44.207
They always lie.

39:44.210 --> 39:46.110
Do you have the shot?

39:50.000 --> 39:51.319
Negaﬁve.

39:52.460 --> 39:54.917
Let us interrogate him.

39:54.920 --> 39:58.492
Put the gun down.
We're the FBI. We'll get the truth.

39:59.540 --> 40:02.828
Marvin, I'm going to put my gun away.

40:05.250 --> 40:07.571
We'll do this together, okay?

40:20.750 --> 40:22.570
Tell him the truth.

40:24.620 --> 40:28.829
-Tell him how you lied on the stand.
-They did hurt me.

40:31.500 --> 40:34.207
Don't listen to him, Marvin.

40:34.210 --> 40:37.168
If he dies, they'll go away.

40:37.170 --> 40:39.536
What do you think, they won't come back?

40:39.540 --> 40:41.201
Waverly, Iowa, 1999.

40:41.210 --> 40:44.282
A man kills two boys, only to
walk away free and kill another one.

40:44.290 --> 40:46.611
-Stop.
-Haskins, Georgia, last year.

40:46.620 --> 40:49.612
Three white guys. Three white guys
kill a black teenager, just because.

40:49.620 --> 40:52.953
Four witnesses see it, the jury
finds them not guilty, just because.

40:52.960 --> 40:55.576
The first two boys were 14 years old.
The third was only 12.

40:55.580 --> 40:57.161
-Shut up!
-It doesn't stop.

40:57.170 --> 40:59.570
Diallo, Blake, Simpson, T. Cullen Davis.

40:59.580 --> 41:02.378
You can't kill fast enough to keep up.

41:05.000 --> 41:06.991
They killed my parents.

41:07.710 --> 41:08.995
I know.

41:10.000 --> 41:12.662
-I'm so tired.
-Marvin, listen to me.

41:15.080 --> 41:19.323
Why don't you just give me the gun,
and I promise you,

41:20.540 --> 41:24.283
I will get you a place to rest.

41:26.040 --> 41:27.826
Are you clear now?

41:31.790 --> 41:32.950
You.

41:35.920 --> 41:37.205
-Qh!

42:32.380 --> 42:34.666
Gandhi said,

42:34.670 --> 42:38.117
"Better to be_violent if there's violence
in our hearts

42:38.120 --> 42:42.238
"than to put on the cloak of
non-violence to cover impotence."

42:45.420 --> 42:46.956
Gandhi also said,

42:46.960 --> 42:50.782
"I object to violence,
because when it appears to do good,

42:50.790 --> 42:53.076
"the good is only temporary.

42:53.080 --> 42:55.958
"The evil it does is permanent."

42:59.460 --> 43:00.666
He got what he deserved.

43:00.920 --> 43:02.911
He only did what the rest of us
wish we could do.

43:03.250 --> 43:05.115
I felt safer when he was alive.

43:05.120 --> 43:07.998
This is why we need gun control.

43:08.580 --> 43:10.912
The guy's a murderer.
He got his own death penalty.

43:10.920 --> 43:12.376
I say he's a hero.

43:12.620 --> 43:16.078
They only killed him because they
were afraid no jury would convict him.
