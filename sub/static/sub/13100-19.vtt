[instrumental music]

00:11.500 --> 00:13.792
- Name?
- Harry. Harry Sanders.

00:13.875 --> 00:14.958
And you're a telepath?

00:15.042 --> 00:16.625
Sure.
What's the job pay?

00:16.708 --> 00:19.167
Well, it's not a job,
it's more like an adventure.

00:19.250 --> 00:21.042
A chance to help fight
the bad guys.

00:21.125 --> 00:23.542
Good. Look, are we talking
hourly or weekly salary

00:23.625 --> 00:25.000
because I got expenses
to cover?

00:25.083 --> 00:27.208
Well, one thing at a time.

00:27.292 --> 00:29.875
If you're a telepath,
are you Psi Corps?

00:29.958 --> 00:31.167
No, they missed me.

00:31.250 --> 00:33.042
No. The Psi Corps doesn't
miss anybody.

00:33.125 --> 00:35.125
Well, some things just fall
through the cracks.

00:35.208 --> 00:36.750
Psi Corps
doesn't have any cracks.

00:36.833 --> 00:39.417
I escaped, okay?
Now where do I sign?

00:39.500 --> 00:41.917
- What am I thinking?
- I don't work for free.

00:42.042 --> 00:44.375
- What am I thinking?
- Right.

00:49.250 --> 00:52.125
Got it. And I think
you're real cute, too.

00:52.208 --> 00:53.583
'Look, I really need
this job.'

00:53.667 --> 00:55.125
But you're not a telepath.

00:55.208 --> 00:56.667
I can learn.
I'm a quick study.

00:56.750 --> 00:58.125
- Out.
- I'll be an intern.

00:58.208 --> 00:59.708
- I work cheap.
- Out!

00:59.792 --> 01:03.417
Great. See? It's not what you
can do it's who you know.

01:03.500 --> 01:04.875
Typical.

01:06.875 --> 01:08.417
(John)
'So how's the recruiting going?'

01:08.500 --> 01:09.708
(Susan)
'Slowly.'

01:09.792 --> 01:11.042
We're still sorting through
the files

01:11.125 --> 01:12.667
and conducting interviews.

01:12.750 --> 01:14.125
I hate being
this open about it.

01:14.208 --> 01:16.500
I agree, but I don't see
any other way to do it.

01:16.583 --> 01:18.083
We need as many telepaths
as we can get

01:18.167 --> 01:19.708
if we're going to
take on the Shadows.

01:19.792 --> 01:21.667
Unfortunately, every time
we tell them about that part

01:21.750 --> 01:23.208
most of them quit instantly.

01:23.292 --> 01:26.000
Well, there is
another possibility.

01:26.083 --> 01:27.833
Franklin was running
an underground railroad

01:27.917 --> 01:30.667
for telepaths escaping
Psi Corps a while back.

01:30.750 --> 01:33.083
He might be able to help us
track down some of those people.

01:33.167 --> 01:35.917
[sighs]
Knowing Stephen,
he's probably wiped his files

01:36.000 --> 01:38.250
in order to keep anyone
from misusing them.

01:38.333 --> 01:39.542
But it's worth a try.

01:39.625 --> 01:40.917
He's still on walkabout

01:41.000 --> 01:43.333
so finding him is gonna be
tough but doable.

01:43.417 --> 01:44.958
And for all its size

01:45.042 --> 01:47.542
it's not like anybody
can hide out here for very long.

01:52.583 --> 01:53.542
[sighs]

01:53.625 --> 01:54.500
[beeps]

01:54.583 --> 01:55.875
Yeah, listen, central.

01:55.958 --> 01:57.625
I've gone over these cables
half dozen times

01:57.708 --> 01:59.417
I can't find the problem.

01:59.500 --> 02:02.583
(male #1 on radio)
'We're still reading
a dead power relay in Grey 16.'

02:02.667 --> 02:04.083
Yeah, well, I don't care
what you're reading.

02:04.167 --> 02:06.208
I'm telling you
that they're all working.

02:06.292 --> 02:07.458
(male #1)
'Then keep looking.'

02:07.542 --> 02:08.833
[beeps]

02:11.167 --> 02:12.625
Alright.

02:14.500 --> 02:17.125
Well, now there's your problem.

02:17.208 --> 02:19.042
Wonder how the hell did that..

02:20.333 --> 02:21.958
Aah!

02:22.042 --> 02:23.625
Aah!

02:23.708 --> 02:24.917
Aah!

02:29.625 --> 02:31.542
(female narrator)
The Babylon project was our

02:31.625 --> 02:34.125
last best hope for peace.

02:34.208 --> 02:35.917
[theme music]

02:37.708 --> 02:39.458
It failed.

02:54.500 --> 02:56.250
But in the year
of the Shadow War

02:56.333 --> 02:57.625
it became something greater.

02:58.667 --> 03:00.708
Our last best hope..

03:00.792 --> 03:02.375
...for victory.

03:06.583 --> 03:08.917
The year is 2260.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.208
The place..

03:10.292 --> 03:12.083
...Babylon 5.

03:14.792 --> 03:17.708
[music continues]

03:34.625 --> 03:37.667
[music continues]

03:57.375 --> 03:59.750
[dramatic music]

04:07.417 --> 04:09.083
(Rathenn)
'Thank you for coming, Delenn.'

04:09.167 --> 04:12.083
The loss of Ranger One
was a great blow to us.

04:12.167 --> 04:15.375
He spoke of you often,
you know.

04:15.458 --> 04:17.375
Always with great reverence.

04:17.458 --> 04:19.667
Did he say anything
before he left?

04:19.750 --> 04:23.417
He...gave me his thanks.

04:23.500 --> 04:26.417
It was all he had to give.

04:26.500 --> 04:27.833
Delenn.

04:29.375 --> 04:32.125
I finished
going over his room.

04:32.208 --> 04:34.208
I found only this.

04:38.292 --> 04:41.125
[instrumental music]

04:41.208 --> 04:44.500
(Rathenn)
'He had very few possessions.'

04:44.583 --> 04:48.000
To be with him was
to have the strangest feeling.

04:48.083 --> 04:50.375
As though he were only
visiting this life

04:50.458 --> 04:54.667
and did not want to be
overly burdened by it.

04:54.750 --> 04:57.292
I'll see to it this is sent on
to his family, Rathenn.

04:57.375 --> 04:59.167
Thank you.

04:59.250 --> 05:02.208
Could you please take this back
to my ship, Lennier?

05:02.292 --> 05:04.208
Of course.

05:06.042 --> 05:07.833
With the loss of Ranger One

05:07.917 --> 05:12.042
there is one last issue
to be taken care of, Delenn

05:12.125 --> 05:13.958
that of a replacement.

05:14.042 --> 05:16.000
The Rangers need a leader

05:16.083 --> 05:19.958
someone to guide and inspire
them in the coming days.

05:20.042 --> 05:21.708
It is a great responsibility.

05:21.792 --> 05:22.917
I know.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.542
But you have
my absolute confidence.

05:24.625 --> 05:25.917
If there is anything
I can do--

05:26.000 --> 05:29.167
I was thinking more of you.

05:29.250 --> 05:31.875
The rangers would support it.

05:31.958 --> 05:35.583
Actually, I don't think they
would rally behind anyone else.

05:35.667 --> 05:38.375
But this is where the Rangers
have been trained.

05:38.458 --> 05:40.750
My place is on Babylon 5.
I cannot--

05:40.833 --> 05:44.542
The Rangers were here
because he was here.

05:44.625 --> 05:47.292
Where you are,
the Rangers will be.

05:48.708 --> 05:52.042
We are coming into
a critical time, Delenn.

05:52.125 --> 05:54.583
They will need you.

05:54.667 --> 05:57.292
Please, say yes.

06:02.625 --> 06:04.292
[gun cocks]

06:05.042 --> 06:06.167
Morning, chief.

06:06.250 --> 06:08.083
- Hey, Zack.
- Sorry to be late.

06:08.167 --> 06:09.750
Uh, I got held up
down in Grey Sector.

06:09.833 --> 06:11.167
Got a weird report.

06:12.833 --> 06:14.083
Is that what I think it is?

06:14.167 --> 06:16.292
Smith and Wesson
.38 caliber revolver.

06:16.375 --> 06:18.125
Used to belong to my grandmother
back when she was working

06:18.208 --> 06:19.250
for the Boston P.D.

06:19.333 --> 06:21.542
A slug thrower.

06:21.625 --> 06:22.667
A slug thrower.

06:22.750 --> 06:24.625
Hey, um, can I, uh..

06:24.708 --> 06:26.208
Yeah, sure.

06:27.333 --> 06:29.208
Oh, she's a beaut.

06:29.292 --> 06:30.958
Now, they still make ammo
for these things?

06:31.042 --> 06:32.583
Yeah, not as much
as they used to

06:32.667 --> 06:35.458
since Earthforce went to
all PPGS for side arms.

06:35.542 --> 06:37.125
You want something
that's gonna burn through flesh

06:37.208 --> 06:38.958
'without punching
a hole in the hull.'

06:39.042 --> 06:41.083
Back home, it's still used
for private security

06:41.167 --> 06:42.708
target practice.

06:42.792 --> 06:45.375
- Why'd you dig it out?
- Oh, I don't know.

06:46.833 --> 06:48.667
Guess since we cut off
ties to Earth

06:48.750 --> 06:50.250
I've been missing it a little.

06:50.333 --> 06:53.250
But this baby...is a solid piece

06:53.333 --> 06:54.958
of my family's history.

06:55.042 --> 06:58.292
So, what is this weird report
in Grey Sector?

06:58.375 --> 07:00.833
Oh, yeah. I don't know
what to make of this one.

07:00.917 --> 07:03.375
They had some dead power relays
in there last night

07:03.458 --> 07:05.542
they sent maintenance down
to check it out.

07:05.625 --> 07:06.875
- Did they fix it?
- Yeah.

07:06.958 --> 07:08.583
You're right,
that is unusual.

07:08.667 --> 07:10.583
[chuckles]
Well, not only that.

07:10.667 --> 07:13.417
The guy who did
the work...disappeared.

07:13.500 --> 07:15.833
What do you mean disappeared?
This is a closed station.

07:15.917 --> 07:18.125
- Where can you go?
- Yeah, that's what I said.

07:18.208 --> 07:20.667
They found his gear,
but no trace of the guy.

07:20.750 --> 07:22.250
'You want me to look into it?'

07:22.333 --> 07:24.000
No. I'll do it.

07:24.083 --> 07:26.042
I like mysteries,
but I hate Grey Sector.

07:26.125 --> 07:28.375
I swear it's like
the Centauri triangle in there.

07:28.458 --> 07:31.083
There's always
some damn thing going wrong.

07:31.167 --> 07:33.750
- I'll see you later.
- Yeah, I'll see you.

07:36.417 --> 07:39.250
[indistinct chattering]

07:41.875 --> 07:44.917
[dramatic music]

08:08.458 --> 08:10.792
(Stephen)
'What are you doing here?'

08:10.875 --> 08:12.625
Stephen?

08:18.833 --> 08:20.458
Are you alright?

08:20.542 --> 08:22.208
Give me some definitions
of alright

08:22.292 --> 08:24.583
and I'll see what I can do.

08:24.667 --> 08:26.333
Are you sick?

08:26.417 --> 08:28.125
I'm not sick.

08:30.375 --> 08:33.042
- Stim withdrawal.
- But I-I don't understand.

08:33.125 --> 08:34.917
You were fine before.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.292
With some drugs, the..

08:36.375 --> 08:38.875
The effects of withdrawal
are immediate.

08:38.958 --> 08:40.542
But with stims,
it's-it's..

08:40.625 --> 08:42.708
It's a little different.

08:42.792 --> 08:44.083
It saturates your bloodstream

08:44.167 --> 08:45.708
and they stay
in your system longer.

08:45.792 --> 08:47.375
[clearing throat]

08:47.458 --> 08:48.875
It takes a while
to flush it all out

08:48.958 --> 08:50.917
but once it's gone, it..

08:52.833 --> 08:54.750
What are you doing here?

08:54.833 --> 08:56.667
Um..

08:56.750 --> 08:58.500
We need your help.

08:58.583 --> 09:00.875
I can't go back. I gotta,
I gotta work this out.

09:00.958 --> 09:03.625
I-I know that,
and I respect that.

09:03.708 --> 09:05.958
But we need the information
that you gathered on telepaths

09:06.042 --> 09:08.792
when you were running
the underground railroad.

09:08.875 --> 09:11.083
We need to find them
so that we can put together

09:11.167 --> 09:12.583
a tactical core group.

09:13.917 --> 09:16.792
I purged the information
from my main computer

09:16.875 --> 09:18.625
but I have a backup.

09:18.708 --> 09:20.583
I figured it might
come in handy one day.

09:20.667 --> 09:22.958
Where is it?

09:23.042 --> 09:24.750
Stephen?

09:24.833 --> 09:28.333
I need to be alone, Susan.

09:28.417 --> 09:30.375
Alright?

09:30.458 --> 09:31.958
'I can't do what I got to do'

09:32.042 --> 09:36.083
if you and Garibaldi
are always following me around.

09:36.167 --> 09:39.042
So I'm going to give you what
you want under one condition.

09:40.875 --> 09:43.000
Don't send anybody else
after me.

09:44.917 --> 09:47.292
- I can't guarantee that.
- Yes, you can!

09:49.208 --> 09:50.417
That's the price.

09:50.500 --> 09:52.458
Now you take it
or you leave it.

09:55.250 --> 09:58.250
Stephen...what if
you get into trouble?

09:58.333 --> 10:00.375
I'm already in trouble.

10:01.750 --> 10:03.083
The only thing I can do now

10:03.167 --> 10:05.125
is to keep walking
until I meet myself

10:05.208 --> 10:07.458
and somehow work this out.

10:13.917 --> 10:16.667
Access my personal computer

10:16.750 --> 10:19.167
data's in a hidden folder,
code name Harriett.

10:19.250 --> 10:22.333
Now everything you need
is right there.

10:22.417 --> 10:25.000
Thank you.

10:25.083 --> 10:27.083
Goodbye, Susan.

10:27.167 --> 10:29.792
And don't come back

10:29.875 --> 10:31.667
No matter what.

10:33.625 --> 10:36.167
[instrumental music]

10:46.125 --> 10:47.625
This was the last place
you heard from him?

10:47.708 --> 10:49.333
Yes, sir, he said that
he couldn't see anything wrong

10:49.417 --> 10:51.042
and then the power grid
came back on.

10:51.125 --> 10:53.083
We waited for him to
check back in, but he didn't.

10:53.167 --> 10:55.417
And after a few hours
we called security.

10:55.500 --> 10:57.042
Anybody check this out?

10:57.125 --> 10:58.833
Yeah, we tubed down
to the level below

10:58.917 --> 11:00.375
in case he fell
through a bad panel

11:00.458 --> 11:01.583
nada.

11:01.667 --> 11:03.542
The cover was back in place
so he'd finished

11:03.625 --> 11:05.708
doing whatever it was
he was doing.

11:05.792 --> 11:07.167
And nobody saw anything?

11:07.250 --> 11:09.375
This whole sector's
mainly industrial stuff.

11:09.458 --> 11:13.042
'I'm telling you it's like he
just vanished into thin air.'

11:13.125 --> 11:16.208
Thin air.
Why is it always thin air?

11:16.292 --> 11:18.250
Never fat air, chubby air

11:18.333 --> 11:21.458
mostly fit, could stand
to lose a few pounds air?

11:21.542 --> 11:24.292
I'm sorry, sir,
but that's not my department.

11:24.375 --> 11:26.208
Have you got any ideas?

11:26.292 --> 11:28.375
Well, aside from
a two-week vacation

11:28.458 --> 11:30.833
in the Mars pleasure dome,
not a one.

11:30.917 --> 11:32.583
Now you're sure
you checked out the area?

11:32.667 --> 11:35.167
Absolutely. We went through
all 29 Grey levels.

11:35.250 --> 11:37.500
You mean 30. There's 30 levels
in Grey Sector.

11:37.583 --> 11:38.875
Nope. 29.

11:38.958 --> 11:41.208
- Well, the schematics--
- Say 30, I know.

11:41.292 --> 11:42.750
It's a mistake
in the blueprints.

11:42.833 --> 11:45.250
You know how they rushed
to get this place finished.

11:45.333 --> 11:47.917
Nobody ever caught it because
not many people get down here.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
Take my word for it,
I went down every floor

11:50.083 --> 11:53.833
of this place myself
and counted. It's 29 for sure.

11:56.208 --> 11:57.417
I think it's a great idea.

11:57.500 --> 11:58.625
You are the natural choice

11:58.708 --> 11:59.958
to take over
as head of the Rangers.

12:00.042 --> 12:01.375
It's the logical choice.

12:01.458 --> 12:03.750
I do not know if it will be
the popular choice.

12:03.833 --> 12:05.958
Why not?
Who'd object?

12:06.042 --> 12:09.167
If I'm lucky, perhaps no one.
If not..

12:09.250 --> 12:11.750
I've decided to hold
the initiation ceremony here

12:11.833 --> 12:13.333
if that meets
with your approval.

12:13.417 --> 12:17.167
Oh, not a problem.
But this is a little public.

12:17.250 --> 12:19.708
I mean until now
the Rangers have only

12:19.792 --> 12:21.083
operated behind the scenes.

12:21.167 --> 12:23.000
That role will change
soon enough.

12:23.083 --> 12:24.625
Before that happens,
they should receive

12:24.708 --> 12:26.750
some of the recognition
they deserve.

12:26.833 --> 12:28.167
Alright.

12:28.250 --> 12:32.000
I'll have Mr. Garibaldi arrange
a security team just--

12:32.083 --> 12:33.750
[beeps]

12:33.833 --> 12:35.208
Sheridan, go.

12:35.292 --> 12:36.708
(Susan)
'Captain, I've got
the information'

12:36.792 --> 12:38.500
'we needed on the telepaths.'

12:38.583 --> 12:40.833
Good, I'll be right there.

12:40.917 --> 12:42.667
Look, I'll catch up
to you later, hmm?

12:42.750 --> 12:45.083
And again, congratulations.

12:45.167 --> 12:46.792
Thank you.

12:50.250 --> 12:52.875
(Neroon)
'Congratulations, Delenn.'

12:54.792 --> 12:58.083
Power beckons, and who among us
is strong enough

12:58.167 --> 13:00.500
to ignore its siren song?

13:00.583 --> 13:01.875
Neroon.

13:01.958 --> 13:04.250
A brilliant strategy, Delenn.

13:04.333 --> 13:06.708
I had not thought you capable
of such ambition.

13:06.792 --> 13:09.000
Clearly, I was mistaken.

13:09.083 --> 13:10.708
What are you talking about?

13:10.792 --> 13:11.958
The Rangers are commissioned

13:12.042 --> 13:15.042
after a thousand
years of silence.

13:15.125 --> 13:18.042
The religious caste begins
constructing new warships

13:18.125 --> 13:21.792
without the knowledge
or consent of the warrior caste.

13:21.875 --> 13:23.625
(Delenn)
'You chose not to act.'

13:23.708 --> 13:24.875
Someone had to.

13:24.958 --> 13:26.417
Perhaps.

13:26.500 --> 13:28.917
Which is why we let you
have them in the beginning.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.417
Even allowed Sinclair
to train them

13:31.500 --> 13:33.750
even though it meant
diluting their purity

13:33.833 --> 13:38.083
by allowing humans to join
alongside our own people.

13:38.167 --> 13:41.833
We were quite tolerant
of your activities.

13:41.917 --> 13:43.208
But now their training
is complete.

13:43.292 --> 13:44.917
They require new leadership.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.542
By right of tradition

13:46.625 --> 13:50.167
the warrior caste should be
given command of the Rangers.

13:50.250 --> 13:54.458
That was the law
as set down by Valen.

13:54.542 --> 13:56.417
Three castes

13:56.500 --> 13:59.583
worker, religious, warrior.

13:59.667 --> 14:02.625
They build, you pray

14:02.708 --> 14:04.333
we fight.

14:04.417 --> 14:06.750
You violated that law
when the warrior caste

14:06.833 --> 14:08.667
became dominant
in the Grey council.

14:08.750 --> 14:11.083
But the Grey council
no longer exists.

14:11.167 --> 14:15.500
You disbanded it.
So what do we have now, Delenn?

14:15.583 --> 14:18.208
You have undergone
the transformation

14:18.292 --> 14:20.917
promised by Valen,
broken the council

14:21.000 --> 14:23.583
'and created
a vacuum of power.'

14:23.667 --> 14:27.917
And now, as an eminent leader
in the religious caste

14:28.000 --> 14:31.333
you plan to take command
of a military force

14:31.417 --> 14:34.500
and fill that vacuum yourself.

14:34.583 --> 14:36.833
I have no desire
to rule our people.

14:36.917 --> 14:39.542
(Neroon)
'I wish I could
believe you, Delenn'

14:39.625 --> 14:41.333
but I don't.

14:41.417 --> 14:44.583
A religious zealot
propelled by prophecy

14:44.667 --> 14:47.583
into a position of military
and political power?

14:47.667 --> 14:49.792
Always a bad idea.

14:51.417 --> 14:53.667
Out of respect,
I give you this opportunity

14:53.750 --> 14:56.458
to walk away from
the path you have taken.

14:56.542 --> 14:58.792
Refuse the position
of Ranger One

14:58.875 --> 15:00.583
and turn control
of the Rangers

15:00.667 --> 15:04.625
over to the warrior caste
where it belongs.

15:04.708 --> 15:06.542
Or?

15:06.625 --> 15:09.583
I am sworn to stop you, Delenn

15:09.667 --> 15:14.125
by any and all means necessary.

15:14.208 --> 15:16.292
(Lennier)
'Delenn?'

15:16.375 --> 15:18.542
Ah, there you are.

15:21.083 --> 15:23.167
Is everything alright?

15:25.750 --> 15:28.292
[intense music]

15:40.042 --> 15:41.167
Grey 2.

15:42.458 --> 15:45.667
One, two, three.

15:45.750 --> 15:47.292
[beeps]

15:53.917 --> 15:55.833
Grey 3.

15:55.917 --> 15:59.417
One, two, three.

15:59.500 --> 16:00.833
[beeps]

16:00.917 --> 16:02.625
Three seconds.

16:04.625 --> 16:07.917
I cannot believe that Neroon
would actually threaten you.

16:08.000 --> 16:09.375
He's a member of
the Grey council.

16:09.458 --> 16:11.875
Was.
The council is no more.

16:11.958 --> 16:14.125
He can do as he sees fit.

16:14.208 --> 16:15.667
This should come
as no surprise.

16:15.750 --> 16:18.500
We knew the warrior caste
was unhappy with our activities.

16:18.583 --> 16:21.542
Unhappy? Delenn, he's planning
to kill you.

16:21.625 --> 16:23.708
That is one interpretation.

16:23.792 --> 16:26.708
He said he would use
any and all means necessary.

16:26.792 --> 16:28.458
I respectfully suggest
that he intends to go

16:28.542 --> 16:29.833
far beyond harsh language.

16:29.917 --> 16:32.833
Lennier, no Minbari
has killed another

16:32.917 --> 16:34.458
in a thousand years.

16:34.542 --> 16:36.708
Yes, but if
the Grey council is gone

16:36.792 --> 16:39.833
and the rules have changed
what else has changed?

16:39.917 --> 16:42.375
'You will tell the captain
about this, I assume.'

16:42.458 --> 16:43.708
No.

16:43.792 --> 16:45.583
This is an internal
problem, Lennier.

16:45.667 --> 16:48.167
If we cannot handle it on our
own, then we shouldn't be here.

16:48.250 --> 16:50.750
So, I want your word

16:50.833 --> 16:52.417
that you will not
tell him about this.

16:52.500 --> 16:54.833
- Delenn, I--
- Your word.

17:00.625 --> 17:03.250
Good.
Now come..

17:03.333 --> 17:04.708
We have much work
ahead of us

17:04.792 --> 17:06.875
to prepare for the ceremony.

17:11.042 --> 17:12.375
Grey 16.

17:13.417 --> 17:14.833
[door closes]

17:17.292 --> 17:20.500
One, two, three.

17:20.583 --> 17:22.000
[beeps]

17:24.875 --> 17:26.750
Grey 17.

17:29.375 --> 17:33.500
One, two, three.

17:35.333 --> 17:38.667
Four, five, six.

17:38.750 --> 17:40.417
[beeps]

17:42.375 --> 17:44.917
[intense music]

17:57.458 --> 17:59.042
Grey 16.

17:59.125 --> 18:00.792
One, two.

18:00.875 --> 18:02.042
Emergency stop.

18:02.125 --> 18:03.875
[beeps]

18:03.958 --> 18:05.667
Open tube doors.

18:05.750 --> 18:08.208
(automated voice)
'This is not a valid
level designation.'

18:08.292 --> 18:09.500
'Safety procedures require--'

18:09.583 --> 18:10.792
Security override.

18:10.875 --> 18:12.833
Unlock tube doors,
allow manual open.

18:15.958 --> 18:18.542
[music continues]

18:31.292 --> 18:32.792
[door closes]

18:42.500 --> 18:44.542
[clattering]

18:58.125 --> 18:59.417
[slams door]

19:01.875 --> 19:04.417
[dramatic music]

19:20.375 --> 19:21.667
[chuckles]

19:24.458 --> 19:27.375
You shouldn't be here.

19:27.458 --> 19:29.125
You're in trouble.

19:30.667 --> 19:31.917
Oh!

19:36.750 --> 19:38.792
[groaning]

19:38.875 --> 19:40.167
Ohh.

19:40.250 --> 19:41.292
[beeps]

19:41.375 --> 19:43.458
Garibaldi to station house.

19:44.708 --> 19:47.542
Ga.. Gar..

19:47.625 --> 19:49.625
Gar..

19:49.708 --> 19:50.833
Ohh.

19:52.583 --> 19:54.167
Told you. Ha ha!

19:54.250 --> 19:57.500
Told you. Ha ha ha.

20:01.667 --> 20:03.042
[instrumental music]

20:03.125 --> 20:05.750
- Hello, Lennier.
- Marcus.

20:09.333 --> 20:11.792
I've never seen
your quarters before.

20:11.875 --> 20:13.708
Very restrained.

20:13.792 --> 20:15.708
It's the best
Ivanova could find

20:15.792 --> 20:17.875
given how tight
we are for space.

20:17.958 --> 20:19.875
It's, uh, enough
for my needs.

20:19.958 --> 20:22.458
Any more would be
a distraction.

20:22.542 --> 20:24.917
I'm trying to avoid
breaking a promise

20:25.000 --> 20:26.875
by breaking a promise.

20:26.958 --> 20:29.375
I promised Delenn that
I would not speak of this

20:29.458 --> 20:31.333
to the captain
or let him know.

20:31.417 --> 20:33.167
She did not mention you by name

20:33.250 --> 20:34.542
but that was implicit.

20:34.625 --> 20:36.458
If I tell the others
in the chain of command

20:36.542 --> 20:38.083
then Sheridan will find out

20:38.167 --> 20:39.792
and I will have broken
the promise.

20:39.875 --> 20:42.208
'But if I break
my promise by telling you'

20:42.292 --> 20:43.792
'since you are not
in the chain of command'

20:43.875 --> 20:45.458
he may not
find out about this

20:45.542 --> 20:47.167
and I will not have
broken the promise.

20:47.250 --> 20:48.917
I'm in awe, Lennier.

20:49.000 --> 20:50.792
The way you can take
a straightforward

20:50.875 --> 20:52.458
logical proposition and turn it

20:52.542 --> 20:55.458
inside out
so that in the end

20:55.542 --> 20:57.708
it says what you want it to say

20:57.792 --> 20:59.792
instead of what it
actually means.

20:59.875 --> 21:02.500
Did this come naturally
or-or did you, um

21:02.583 --> 21:04.917
attend some special
martial arts class

21:05.000 --> 21:06.458
for the philosophically
inclined?

21:06.542 --> 21:10.542
Marcus, I think Delenn's life
may be in jeopardy.

21:10.625 --> 21:13.000
'One of our own, a former member
of the Grey council'

21:13.083 --> 21:15.958
has challenged her right
to lead the Rangers.

21:16.042 --> 21:19.500
I think he may resort
to violence to stop her.

21:19.583 --> 21:21.208
Warrior caste?

21:21.292 --> 21:23.333
Typical.

21:23.417 --> 21:25.333
But I was taught that Minbari

21:25.417 --> 21:27.542
do not kill Minbari.

21:27.625 --> 21:29.667
Correct, and given
their positions

21:29.750 --> 21:31.833
it's even that much
more unthinkable.

21:31.917 --> 21:33.375
If he harms her

21:33.458 --> 21:34.542
if a Minbari from one caste

21:34.625 --> 21:36.458
even tries to kill another then

21:36.542 --> 21:39.958
the shock and anger will lead
to retribution back home.

21:40.042 --> 21:42.583
It could even cause
a civil war between the castes.

21:42.667 --> 21:44.792
(Marcus)
'And the same would apply
if you went after him.'

21:44.875 --> 21:47.542
So you're looking for
a non-Minbari to stop him.

21:47.625 --> 21:50.250
- Yes.
- He's probably gone hiding.

21:50.333 --> 21:52.375
Can you find him
before the ceremony?

21:52.458 --> 21:54.000
It will be difficult.

21:54.083 --> 21:56.375
He won't appear again
until he's ready to move

21:56.458 --> 21:58.792
but, yes, it can be done.

22:00.208 --> 22:02.375
Marcus, you need
only delay him

22:02.458 --> 22:04.250
until the ceremony
is complete.

22:04.333 --> 22:06.542
Once it's done
it cannot be undone.

22:06.625 --> 22:08.958
Try to avoid
confronting him directly.

22:09.042 --> 22:11.500
He is one of the best
of the warrior caste.

22:11.583 --> 22:13.833
He's trained at
killing your people.

22:13.917 --> 22:15.958
He's very good
at what he does.

22:16.042 --> 22:19.125
Just tell me when and where.
Leave the rest to me.

22:21.875 --> 22:24.333
[panting]

22:24.417 --> 22:26.833
[coughs]

22:28.583 --> 22:31.625
[dramatic music]

22:46.250 --> 22:48.083
[continues panting]

23:04.333 --> 23:06.208
I don't suppose this is
the best time to point out

23:06.292 --> 23:09.000
you're...all under arrest.

23:11.417 --> 23:13.958
Consider..

23:14.042 --> 23:15.708
...the hand.

23:15.792 --> 23:17.833
Hmm.

23:17.917 --> 23:20.833
Veins, capillaries

23:20.917 --> 23:23.667
muscles, cells

23:23.750 --> 23:27.542
moons, stars, planets

23:27.625 --> 23:29.458
galaxies.

23:29.542 --> 23:34.875
All trapped inside
ephemeral, translucent flesh.

23:34.958 --> 23:37.167
[chuckles]

23:37.250 --> 23:39.500
The palm.

23:39.583 --> 23:41.917
We have lines

23:42.000 --> 23:44.792
we have signs

23:44.875 --> 23:46.333
we have shapes

23:46.417 --> 23:48.083
equations.

23:50.375 --> 23:52.750
All creation..

23:54.083 --> 23:55.958
...in a hangnail.

23:57.292 --> 23:59.375
My name is Jeremiah.

23:59.458 --> 24:03.250
Welcome to the end
of the world.

24:10.917 --> 24:13.833
(John)
How many more did you say
we've got coming in?

24:13.917 --> 24:19.000
(Delenn)
Quite a few, I'm afraid.
It's necessary for the ceremony.

24:19.083 --> 24:23.000
But, uh, we have a few minutes
before the next shuttle.

24:28.083 --> 24:29.708
Ooh.

24:29.792 --> 24:32.875
So many faces
I haven't seen in so long.

24:32.958 --> 24:34.625
Hm.

24:34.708 --> 24:36.958
It brings back
a lot of memories.

24:38.875 --> 24:40.417
You know

24:40.500 --> 24:44.208
you've never talked much
about your life back home.

24:45.958 --> 24:49.583
You never even talk about,
uh, your family.

24:49.667 --> 24:52.833
It would be difficult
to explain to a non-Minbari.

24:54.792 --> 24:56.792
After I was born

24:56.875 --> 24:59.958
my mother entered
the sisters of Valeria.

25:00.042 --> 25:01.917
I have seen her
only twice since.

25:02.042 --> 25:03.292
Oh, sorry.

25:03.375 --> 25:04.458
No.

25:04.542 --> 25:06.333
No, it's a great honor.

25:06.417 --> 25:09.292
I miss her greatly,
but it is her wish.

25:10.750 --> 25:12.208
And your father?

25:13.667 --> 25:16.917
He passed beyond
the veil 10 years ago.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.708
To see us making war
against your people

25:19.792 --> 25:22.417
broke his heart.

25:22.500 --> 25:24.417
The thing I remember
about him..

25:26.250 --> 25:28.375
When I was a child

25:28.458 --> 25:30.750
he would take me
with him to temple.

25:30.833 --> 25:32.250
He carried me
on his shoulder

25:32.333 --> 25:34.125
so that I could
see everything.

25:35.708 --> 25:40.250
One day I came outside with him
to go to temple and..

25:40.333 --> 25:43.375
And he said,
"I'm sorry, Delenn

25:43.458 --> 25:46.083
but you are too big now
for me to carry you."

25:47.958 --> 25:52.125
I realized then that my father
would never again

25:52.208 --> 25:54.000
carry me in his arms.

25:55.792 --> 25:57.125
I felt such loss.

25:58.375 --> 26:01.792
And I knew for
the first time

26:01.875 --> 26:04.250
that someday
I would lose him.

26:06.125 --> 26:08.792
Then I looked in his eyes

26:08.875 --> 26:11.750
and I saw that he was
thinking the same thing.

26:13.500 --> 26:16.625
I don't think
I...ever loved him more

26:16.708 --> 26:18.750
then at that moment.

26:20.708 --> 26:22.750
[instrumental music]

26:28.292 --> 26:30.042
(Jeremiah)
You see, my friend

26:30.125 --> 26:33.250
the universe is sentient

26:33.333 --> 26:36.708
aware, alive.

26:36.792 --> 26:38.500
Now the Minbari
understand this.

26:38.583 --> 26:40.333
[laughs]
Oh, yes.

26:40.417 --> 26:42.000
They understand completely.

26:42.083 --> 26:44.542
That is why they nearly
defeated us

26:44.625 --> 26:46.042
in the war, you know.

26:46.125 --> 26:49.708
Because they are closer
to the truth than we are.

26:49.792 --> 26:52.458
The truth strengthens us

26:52.542 --> 26:56.500
ennobles us, sets us free.

26:56.583 --> 26:58.500
Speaking of getting free

26:58.583 --> 27:00.292
there has to be
a way out of here.

27:00.375 --> 27:02.292
(Jeremiah)
'Pressure doors
are welded shut'

27:02.375 --> 27:04.000
'the tube is disabled.'

27:04.083 --> 27:06.458
We, uh, tap into
the recycling system

27:06.542 --> 27:09.750
and purify it.
We're all recycled, you know.

27:09.833 --> 27:12.875
Just, uh, molecules and atoms

27:12.958 --> 27:14.833
born in the stars and, uh

27:14.917 --> 27:17.792
recycled into
carbon based life, hmm?

27:17.875 --> 27:21.458
Why do you think we have spent
millions of years

27:21.542 --> 27:23.458
trying to understand the stars

27:23.542 --> 27:26.917
the moons, and-and-and
the universe itself, hmm?

27:27.000 --> 27:32.167
Hmm? Ha, well, because
we are the universe.

27:32.250 --> 27:34.375
The universe made manifest.

27:34.458 --> 27:37.250
It-it broke itself into pieces

27:37.333 --> 27:40.083
to examine every aspect
of its being.

27:40.167 --> 27:43.125
We try to understand it
because in so doing

27:43.208 --> 27:46.208
well, we will
understand ourselves.

27:46.292 --> 27:48.917
So we-we have come here

27:49.042 --> 27:50.917
and we've isolated ourselves

27:51.000 --> 27:55.667
in order to attain
a purity of thought

27:55.750 --> 27:58.917
because purity of form
and purity of intent

27:59.000 --> 28:03.708
purity of execution.
That-that is the only way.

28:05.167 --> 28:08.792
The only way the door will open.

28:08.875 --> 28:10.542
The door?

28:12.125 --> 28:14.417
[instrumental music]

28:35.208 --> 28:36.583
[door opens]

28:40.208 --> 28:43.208
(Marcus)
So you must be Neroon.

28:48.958 --> 28:50.708
You shouldn't
get involved in things

28:50.792 --> 28:54.625
that don't concern you.
My quarrel is with Delenn.

28:54.708 --> 28:56.917
Then your quarrel is with me.

28:57.875 --> 29:01.083
Do you have any idea who I am?

29:01.167 --> 29:03.000
I do.

29:03.083 --> 29:07.125
But the only way you will
get to her is through me.

29:07.208 --> 29:09.083
denn-shah.

29:09.167 --> 29:11.292
To the death.

29:11.375 --> 29:13.000
[metal clanking]

29:13.083 --> 29:16.625
During the war,
I killed 50,000 of you.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.583
What's one more?

29:21.292 --> 29:23.000
[metal clanking]

29:23.083 --> 29:26.250
Not bad for a beginner.

29:26.333 --> 29:27.542
Last chance.

29:27.625 --> 29:30.833
I was taught the pike
by Durhann, himself.

29:30.917 --> 29:32.792
Really? So was I.

29:36.958 --> 29:38.750
[grunting]

29:38.833 --> 29:40.750
You're a fool.

29:40.833 --> 29:44.958
But if this is what you wish
it shall be.

29:45.042 --> 29:46.625
To the death!

29:48.833 --> 29:50.625
[instrumental music]

29:58.208 --> 29:59.625
Any problems?

29:59.708 --> 30:01.458
None that I've heard about.

30:03.000 --> 30:06.000
Where's Marcus?
I thought for sure he'd be here.

30:06.083 --> 30:08.042
I don't know.
Something must have come up.

30:08.125 --> 30:10.875
[metal clanking]

30:10.958 --> 30:12.958
[grunting]

30:24.625 --> 30:27.208
[music continues]

30:37.125 --> 30:40.125
One day the universe
will truly understand itself

30:40.208 --> 30:42.417
and at that moment,
it will transcend itself.

30:42.500 --> 30:44.750
It will become something else
something even greater

30:44.833 --> 30:46.875
another, another big bang!

30:46.958 --> 30:49.917
Only this time, this time
consciously directed

30:50.000 --> 30:51.458
because this time
the universe

30:51.542 --> 30:54.167
will know exactly
what it's doing.

30:54.250 --> 30:57.708
Right now it-it-it kills
everything it makes.

30:57.792 --> 30:59.750
Everything it designs dies.

30:59.833 --> 31:02.083
It's-it's a serious design flaw
to say the least.

31:02.167 --> 31:04.958
But next time, oh,
next time it'll be perfect.

31:05.042 --> 31:07.292
We-we will be perfect.

31:13.708 --> 31:17.333
Uh..
Michael, right?

31:17.417 --> 31:18.958
May I call you Michael?

31:19.042 --> 31:21.458
Uh, people like you, Michael

31:21.542 --> 31:23.000
people like you
suffer from the fact

31:23.083 --> 31:24.750
that you do not remember

31:24.833 --> 31:27.125
having been part of
the universe.

31:27.208 --> 31:29.958
You're, uh, sort of
left out of the cosmic loop

31:30.042 --> 31:31.292
so to speak.

31:31.375 --> 31:33.958
Uh, you know,
driven mad by the silence

31:34.042 --> 31:35.625
the terrible isolation.

31:35.708 --> 31:38.125
But you see, we-we remember.

31:38.208 --> 31:41.500
We remember the universe.
We feel the connection.

31:41.583 --> 31:42.833
[retching]

31:42.917 --> 31:45.583
Uh, are-are you alright?

31:45.667 --> 31:47.208
(Michael)
No.

31:47.292 --> 31:49.292
Ever since you shot me
with that tranq

31:49.375 --> 31:51.167
I've been having these cramps.

31:52.708 --> 31:54.042
They're getting worse.

31:54.125 --> 31:56.708
Find Ezekial. Bring him here.

31:56.792 --> 31:58.542
[panting]

31:58.625 --> 32:01.375
Now, now, now,
it's-it's going to be alright.

32:01.458 --> 32:02.708
It's going to be
alright, Michael.

32:02.792 --> 32:04.333
We'll take care of you.
Don't worry.

32:04.417 --> 32:06.750
Hyaa!

32:06.833 --> 32:09.375
Now, you show me
the door out of here

32:09.458 --> 32:12.042
or your feet are the only things

32:12.125 --> 32:15.250
you're gonna see for
the rest of your crummy life.

32:15.333 --> 32:16.750
Got it?

32:19.708 --> 32:21.250
Good.

32:21.333 --> 32:23.875
[dramatic music]

32:32.417 --> 32:35.833
This is foolish.
A waste of material.

32:35.917 --> 32:39.167
is invoked,
I cannot surrender but you..

32:39.250 --> 32:41.458
...you are not Minbari.

32:41.542 --> 32:44.167
'Step aside, and I will pretend
that you ran away'

32:44.250 --> 32:46.875
changed your mind.
No one will know.

32:46.958 --> 32:50.708
Unh! I am a Ranger!

32:50.792 --> 32:54.375
We walk in the dark places
no others will enter.

32:54.458 --> 32:58.417
We stand on the bridge
and no one may pass.

32:58.500 --> 33:02.250
We live for the one.
We die for the one!

33:05.875 --> 33:07.917
[metal clanking]

33:09.625 --> 33:11.417
[grunting]

33:19.792 --> 33:22.125
I've just broken
two of your ribs.

33:23.500 --> 33:26.167
Sorry, make that three.

33:29.000 --> 33:32.042
Why? Why all of this?

33:32.125 --> 33:34.417
Pride? Duty?

33:34.500 --> 33:35.792
You've been trained well

33:35.875 --> 33:38.083
but you must've known
you couldn't win.

33:38.167 --> 33:39.625
So why do it?

33:41.583 --> 33:43.125
F-for her.

33:44.542 --> 33:46.708
[sniffles]

33:46.792 --> 33:48.333
We live for the one.

33:49.958 --> 33:51.958
We die..

33:52.042 --> 33:53.458
...for the one.

33:55.167 --> 33:58.417
Isil'Zha, sendi..

34:00.083 --> 34:02.125
In Valen's name..

34:04.375 --> 34:06.750
[intense music]

34:18.417 --> 34:20.375
This belonged to
the worker who disappeared.

34:20.458 --> 34:23.125
- You do this?
- Oh, no.

34:23.208 --> 34:26.125
We do not believe
in violence.

34:26.208 --> 34:28.250
Somebody does.

34:28.333 --> 34:30.417
He must have gotten
in here somehow

34:30.500 --> 34:31.958
so there must be
a way out.

34:32.042 --> 34:33.542
Which way?

34:33.625 --> 34:37.167
Oh, you still do not
understand, do you?

34:39.750 --> 34:43.292
Perhaps that is why
I am here.

34:43.375 --> 34:46.917
To-to help you understand.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.167
Yes.

34:49.250 --> 34:50.333
Yes.

34:50.417 --> 34:53.500
It's my time, I suppose.

34:53.583 --> 34:55.500
Time to..

34:55.583 --> 34:56.792
...to move on.

34:58.083 --> 35:01.208
I am as pure as I am

35:01.292 --> 35:03.292
ever going to be.

35:03.375 --> 35:04.667
Oh, what are you..

35:04.750 --> 35:06.583
[screeching]

35:06.667 --> 35:08.792
What the hell is that?

35:08.875 --> 35:13.125
Listen, listen, if the only way
out is-is to find a

35:13.208 --> 35:15.708
a purity of-of purpose,
a purity of thought

35:15.792 --> 35:20.208
a purity of belief.
You see that, that is the door.

35:20.292 --> 35:24.208
The door of the mind.
The way. The way out.

35:24.292 --> 35:27.500
But you see, the body, the body
must also have a way out

35:27.583 --> 35:29.583
uh, a way out
that is equally pure.

35:29.667 --> 35:32.167
[screeching]

35:32.250 --> 35:34.625
Start making sense.
Now!

35:34.708 --> 35:36.500
I am.

35:36.583 --> 35:40.042
Now...if we are the universe

35:40.125 --> 35:41.875
then the universe
must consume us

35:41.958 --> 35:45.708
in an act of
absolute-absolute purity.

35:45.792 --> 35:49.542
Now, within the universe,
we have a perfect predator.

35:49.625 --> 35:51.708
No instinct, no thought

35:51.792 --> 35:54.958
except for the hunt.

35:55.042 --> 35:57.375
Living perfection.

35:57.458 --> 35:59.542
When it is our time

35:59.625 --> 36:01.458
we choose to return
to the universe

36:01.542 --> 36:05.792
through that perfection,
through-through the zarg.

36:05.875 --> 36:07.042
- Zarg?
- Yes.

36:07.125 --> 36:08.708
You have a zarg in here?
Are you nuts?

36:08.792 --> 36:10.250
That's one of the most
dangerous aliens

36:10.333 --> 36:11.458
in the whole sector.

36:11.542 --> 36:13.417
[screeching]

36:16.625 --> 36:18.333
Come on.

36:18.417 --> 36:20.042
(Rathenn)
'As it was done long ago'

36:20.125 --> 36:23.042
so now we name
she who will lead us.

36:23.125 --> 36:27.208
So among the Rangers,
let her be known as entil..

36:34.792 --> 36:37.917
- Is this part of the ceremony?
- I don't know.

36:43.167 --> 36:44.375
[clangs]

36:45.708 --> 36:47.750
There is now blood between us

36:47.833 --> 36:50.500
and there is blood between
the warrior caste

36:50.583 --> 36:52.917
and the humans.

36:53.000 --> 36:56.292
I do not think
they would die for me

36:56.375 --> 36:59.375
but they would die..

36:59.458 --> 37:01.125
...for you..

37:02.792 --> 37:05.208
...Entil'Zha.

37:10.875 --> 37:13.958
[crowd whispering]

37:18.083 --> 37:20.167
[screeching]

37:40.583 --> 37:42.000
[groaning]

37:42.083 --> 37:43.750
[grunting]

37:43.833 --> 37:45.167
[screeching]

37:45.250 --> 37:48.083
I think I hurt it,
but it just made it mad.

37:48.167 --> 37:50.667
Damn it! If I just
had something, anything.

37:52.708 --> 37:54.542
Wait a minute.

37:56.958 --> 37:59.500
[intense music]

38:13.333 --> 38:14.583
Marcus.

38:14.667 --> 38:17.708
I don't see why
you are fighting this, Michael.

38:17.792 --> 38:19.750
To be consumed by the universe

38:19.833 --> 38:21.750
in one of its most
perfect forms

38:21.833 --> 38:25.083
well, that's the highest destiny
one can achieve.

38:25.167 --> 38:26.500
Oh, yeah?

38:26.583 --> 38:27.917
Well, then why the hell
are you in here with me

38:28.000 --> 38:29.625
instead of out there
with that thing?

38:29.708 --> 38:31.208
[screeching]

38:34.167 --> 38:36.292
Well, um, you see, I've..

38:36.375 --> 38:41.250
I-I-I've decided that I'm not
sufficiently transcendent yet.

38:41.333 --> 38:43.333
[screeching]

38:43.417 --> 38:45.417
Well, then you better get your
transcendent butt behind me

38:45.500 --> 38:47.542
and hope his works out
because we only got one chance

38:47.625 --> 38:50.208
assuming this doesn't
kill us before it does.

38:56.333 --> 38:57.917
[gunshots]

39:00.167 --> 39:01.833
[groaning]

39:05.125 --> 39:07.208
Don't even think about it.

39:12.833 --> 39:14.333
Now..

39:14.417 --> 39:17.417
...we are going to find
a way out of here, aren't we?

39:17.500 --> 39:19.208
I hate Grey Sector.

39:22.083 --> 39:23.167
[instrumental music]

39:24.667 --> 39:27.333
This should never have been
allowed to happen

39:27.417 --> 39:28.917
not for my sake.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.833
If not for yours,
then who else?

39:31.917 --> 39:34.125
He could have been killed.

39:34.208 --> 39:38.833
Delenn, all we know
is that we will die.

39:38.917 --> 39:40.917
It is only a matter
of how, when

39:41.000 --> 39:43.417
and whether or not
it is with honor.

39:43.500 --> 39:46.125
He did what any of us
would have done.

39:46.208 --> 39:48.000
Respectfully, Delenn, I think

39:48.083 --> 39:49.833
this is the one thing
about your position

39:49.917 --> 39:52.292
you do not yet understand.

39:52.375 --> 39:56.167
You cherish life.
Life is your goal.

39:56.250 --> 39:58.458
But for the greater part
to live

39:58.542 --> 40:01.625
some must die or be harmed
in its defense and yours.

40:01.708 --> 40:03.542
There is no other way.

40:03.625 --> 40:05.625
Now, the doctors say
that Marcus will recover

40:05.708 --> 40:08.542
and that is what matters.
He unders..

40:10.375 --> 40:12.208
Have you come to finish
what you started?

40:12.292 --> 40:15.542
If I had wished him dead,
he would be dead.

40:15.625 --> 40:17.333
Then why did you stop short?

40:17.417 --> 40:19.833
That is between the two of us.

40:19.917 --> 40:24.208
I would speak to him alone
one warrior to another.

40:24.292 --> 40:27.333
- Then I will go.
- He will not hear you.

40:27.417 --> 40:29.542
Then I will speak briefly.

40:40.833 --> 40:44.000
you said.

40:44.083 --> 40:46.667
To the death.

40:46.750 --> 40:49.708
And death there was.

40:49.792 --> 40:51.958
The death was mine.

40:53.542 --> 40:58.250
To see a human
invoke the name of Valen

40:58.333 --> 41:00.625
to be willing to die
for one of my kind

41:00.708 --> 41:05.333
when I was intent
upon killing one of my own

41:05.417 --> 41:08.625
the rightness
of my cause disappeared.

41:10.833 --> 41:12.958
Strange..

41:13.042 --> 41:15.208
...that a human
in his last moments

41:15.292 --> 41:18.542
should be more
of a Minbari than I.

41:18.625 --> 41:22.708
Perhaps it is true
what Delenn said.

41:22.792 --> 41:25.708
That we are not
of the same blood

41:25.792 --> 41:28.958
but we are of
the same heart.

41:35.667 --> 41:37.792
(Marcus)
'The next time..'

41:39.458 --> 41:42.042
[instrumental music]

41:45.333 --> 41:47.333
The next time..

41:48.583 --> 41:51.417
...you want a revelation..

41:53.792 --> 41:57.083
...could you
possibly find a way..

41:58.375 --> 42:00.458
...that isn't..

42:00.542 --> 42:02.250
...quite so..

42:02.333 --> 42:05.083
...uncomfortable.

42:05.167 --> 42:08.208
[Neroon laughing]

42:14.000 --> 42:15.292
Captain..

42:15.375 --> 42:17.542
...you wouldn't believe
the day I've had.

42:17.625 --> 42:20.292
The day you've had?
We had an assault on Marcus.

42:20.375 --> 42:22.000
Someone got into
the Ranger ceremony..

42:22.083 --> 42:23.792
could've killed Delenn.

42:23.875 --> 42:25.958
And where were you?

42:26.042 --> 42:29.792
Okay. Well, first there was this
missing maintenance man.

42:29.875 --> 42:31.875
Only, he wasn't missing,
he was killed by a zarg.

42:31.958 --> 42:33.458
But I'm getting
ahead of myself.

42:33.542 --> 42:35.542
That was after I found out
that the entire 17th floor

42:35.625 --> 42:37.958
of Grey Sector
had completely disappeared.

42:38.042 --> 42:39.458
Well, not disappeared exactly.

42:39.542 --> 42:41.583
This weird cult had
taken over the place, see.

42:41.667 --> 42:43.583
And there was a dummy that shot
tranqs out of its eyes.

42:43.667 --> 42:46.375
It was very strange. But it was
all supposed to be perfect.

42:46.458 --> 42:48.833
'That was the thing about it.
And there wasn't a way out.

42:48.917 --> 42:50.750
But there was,
except it was spiritual

42:50.833 --> 42:52.375
and you had to die
a perfect death.

42:52.458 --> 42:54.958
That's where the zarg came in
and either it was gonna kill me

42:55.042 --> 42:57.500
or I was gonna kill it and--

42:57.583 --> 42:59.333
Am I going too fast for you?

43:04.792 --> 43:07.250
