00:00.553 --> 00:02.454
<i>Previously on</i>
<i>The Borgias...</i>

00:02.522 --> 00:05.390
<i>They settled</i>
<i>like crows around me -</i>

00:05.458 --> 00:08.125
<i>praying for my death.</i>

00:08.194 --> 00:10.529
Cardinal Orsini,
Cardinal De Luca.

00:10.630 --> 00:12.432
I came as soon as I heard.

00:12.499 --> 00:15.801
<i>My father lives. You failed.</i>

00:15.869 --> 00:17.369
Where are these
allies, Cesare?

00:17.471 --> 00:18.604
Who are our friends?

00:18.672 --> 00:20.339
<i>Without him,</i>
<i>what becomes of us?</i>

00:20.406 --> 00:21.607
<i>You should go.</i>
<i>It's not safe here.</i>

00:21.674 --> 00:23.208
<i>I'm to be your husband.</i>

00:23.276 --> 00:24.342
<i>Yes, but you're not yet.</i>

00:24.443 --> 00:25.844
I will send for you.

00:25.911 --> 00:27.679
What is this?
This is your freedom.

00:27.747 --> 00:30.249
Don't forget who put
it in your hands.

00:30.317 --> 00:32.218
Guards!

00:32.286 --> 00:33.820
Did you do this?
No.

00:33.888 --> 00:35.288
All this has done
is move things along

00:35.356 --> 00:37.257
a little faster than
we'd anticipated.

00:37.324 --> 00:38.658
Now I require
your assistance.

00:38.726 --> 00:40.360
And if I refuse?

00:40.428 --> 00:44.231
<i>Your cousin Catherina will</i>
<i>not be denied this chance.</i>

00:44.299 --> 00:46.566
<i>He will die.</i>
<i>As will they all die.</i>

00:47.869 --> 00:49.503
All is well here?
No.

00:49.571 --> 00:51.505
There is a plot to
kill your family.

00:51.573 --> 00:52.740
<i>When?</i>

00:52.808 --> 00:54.142
<i>Tonight. Now.</i>

00:59.315 --> 01:01.617
<i>All the snakes</i>
<i>in Rome have slid forth.</i>

01:01.685 --> 01:05.588
Who is to protect
this family if not you?

01:05.656 --> 01:07.290
<i>Ascanio betrayed us.</i>

01:07.358 --> 01:09.192
<i>Then we will</i>
<i>have to find another way.</i>

01:09.260 --> 01:10.560
The cardinals?

01:10.628 --> 01:12.161
<i>No, their families.</i>

01:12.229 --> 01:14.398
<i>Orsini. Vitelli.</i>
<i>Baglioni.</i>

01:14.466 --> 01:15.666
<i>They hate each other.</i>

01:15.733 --> 01:18.469
They hate
the Borgias more.

01:18.537 --> 01:19.770
<i>Open your eyes.</i>

01:19.872 --> 01:21.139
We're not safe.

01:21.206 --> 01:23.041
We are at war.

02:59.447 --> 03:01.649
Della Rovere's escape

03:01.750 --> 03:05.687
was orchestrated
by whom?

03:05.754 --> 03:08.657
<i>Of that,</i>
<i>I must plead ignorance.</i>

03:12.429 --> 03:16.198
We are in a snake pit,

03:16.266 --> 03:21.036
surrounded by venom
and smiling vipers,

03:21.104 --> 03:25.008
and our son
pleads ignorance?

03:26.745 --> 03:29.581
Maybe it was you, hm?

03:29.682 --> 03:31.216
Ow.

03:35.354 --> 03:37.756
Let me.

03:40.993 --> 03:45.663
Maybe you helped him to
live to see another day.

03:47.299 --> 03:50.034
The day perhaps when
your beloved father

03:50.102 --> 03:52.237
breathes
his last.

03:52.304 --> 03:53.771
If you believe that,
Father,

03:53.839 --> 03:57.408
then you have lost
all faith in me.

03:57.476 --> 04:02.647
We have lost faith in
everyone, everything,

04:02.715 --> 04:06.919
even the hand
that guides us.

04:06.987 --> 04:09.421
Surely not in
your own family?

04:09.489 --> 04:12.758
Our family.

04:12.826 --> 04:15.862
That...

04:15.930 --> 04:18.865
bosom of trust
and tranquillity.

04:21.970 --> 04:24.038
No.

04:24.106 --> 04:29.277
We feel safe in
the arms of our family.

04:29.345 --> 04:32.981
But as for that
nest of vipers -

04:33.049 --> 04:34.883
called the College
of Cardinals -

04:34.951 --> 04:36.418
we shall cleanse them.

04:36.519 --> 04:38.687
Purge it.

04:38.755 --> 04:43.158
As we ourselves
have been purged.

04:50.365 --> 04:54.134
So, Brother,
who called us here?

04:54.202 --> 04:56.236
This letter.

04:56.337 --> 04:58.438
Unsigned.

04:58.506 --> 05:01.174
It promised sport against
the Borgia family.

05:01.242 --> 05:03.243
And what if a Borgia
wrote it?

05:03.311 --> 05:05.679
Too clever surely -
even for them.

05:05.746 --> 05:09.617
Can you think of a better way
to draw out their enemies?

05:27.301 --> 05:28.969
Who's there?

05:30.271 --> 05:33.207
Vitelli.

05:33.274 --> 05:38.179
Paulo Orsini -
and Roberto.

05:38.280 --> 05:41.982
When did you take
to writing letters?

05:42.050 --> 05:45.086
We didn't.

05:45.187 --> 05:46.821
You were summoned too?

05:46.889 --> 05:48.890
Vitelli.

05:51.060 --> 05:52.527
Prospero Colonna.

05:52.595 --> 05:54.962
We were summoned
here by the Orsini?

05:55.030 --> 05:57.899
<i>You were summoned by me.</i>

05:57.966 --> 06:00.101
And you are?

06:00.169 --> 06:04.072
I am the black heart
of a Borgia nightmare.

06:04.139 --> 06:06.841
I speak with Catherina
Sforza's voice

06:06.909 --> 06:09.677
and she invites
you all to join her

06:09.745 --> 06:12.347
in a confederacy
of hatred.

06:12.414 --> 06:13.715
A hatred
of the Sforza?

06:13.782 --> 06:15.984
We all sign up
to that.

06:16.051 --> 06:17.652
And she would
call you fool.

06:17.719 --> 06:19.220
She would remind you
of the days

06:19.288 --> 06:20.921
when families ruled
this papacy of ours.

06:21.023 --> 06:22.723
<i>Roman families.</i>

06:22.791 --> 06:26.827
Sforza, Colonna, Vitelli -

06:26.928 --> 06:28.662
Orsini.

06:31.266 --> 06:33.234
Bury your enmities,

06:33.302 --> 06:37.272
bury them until the
Borgia snake is lanced.

06:37.339 --> 06:39.373
And she has the
power to do that?

06:39.441 --> 06:41.209
With your help.

06:43.646 --> 06:47.482
And then, we can happily
hate each other again.

06:49.752 --> 06:51.185
She will drink to that.

06:53.389 --> 06:55.223
Think of Rome

06:55.290 --> 06:59.159
as a spider's web,
my son.

06:59.227 --> 07:06.833
Each family has its silken
thread attached to an egg

07:06.901 --> 07:10.003
that is planted
within these walls.

07:10.070 --> 07:13.373
Orsini. Baglioni.
Vitelli. Colonna.

07:13.441 --> 07:18.044
And each one of those
diaphanous threads

07:18.112 --> 07:24.984
go back through their families
to the tarantula of Forli.

07:25.051 --> 07:32.257
The great Arachne,
Catherina Sforza.

07:32.325 --> 07:38.497
And every egg wears
a cardinal's hat

07:38.565 --> 07:43.669
and a smile of
obedience and piety.

07:43.737 --> 07:50.477
And plots to murder you,
your mother, your sister.

07:50.545 --> 07:57.017
And the plot to murder
your beloved brother...

07:57.085 --> 07:59.052
...succeeds.

07:59.120 --> 08:01.955
Unforgiveable,
surely.

08:04.592 --> 08:10.096
So if you are
to gain our love again,

08:10.164 --> 08:14.434
we would have you trace
those silken threads -

08:15.503 --> 08:19.506
back to the families
outside these walls.

08:19.574 --> 08:24.612
And let us deal with
the cardinals within.

08:28.116 --> 08:29.517
<i>And then</i>
<i>I never saw her again.</i>

08:32.453 --> 08:33.955
We're being followed.

08:34.056 --> 08:35.121
Warn him off.

08:35.190 --> 08:36.390
Yes, my lord.

08:36.457 --> 08:38.793
You! Be wise
and go home now.

08:38.894 --> 08:40.395
I am never wise.

08:40.462 --> 08:42.798
Hey!

08:44.067 --> 08:45.701
Go!

09:02.087 --> 09:04.155
My Lord Vitelli.

09:04.222 --> 09:05.556
My Lord Borgia.

09:05.623 --> 09:07.591
You are in
quite the hurry.

09:07.658 --> 09:09.259
We were accosted.

09:09.327 --> 09:13.730
Rome is a lethal place
at times like these.

09:13.831 --> 09:15.598
Who bears you
a grudge?

09:15.666 --> 09:18.434
I know not.

09:18.536 --> 09:21.638
My whole family
was assaulted.

09:21.706 --> 09:25.175
And but for the actions
of my brave manservant,

09:25.276 --> 09:28.078
my mother, sister,
and nephew

09:28.146 --> 09:30.080
would lie like carrion
in the streets.

09:30.148 --> 09:32.149
Yes, I heard as much.

09:32.217 --> 09:34.151
You also heard who set
the dogs upon them?

09:34.219 --> 09:36.186
No, I don't trust rumour.

09:36.254 --> 09:39.257
Catherina Sforza,
it is rumoured.

09:39.324 --> 09:42.827
It is also rumoured
that she had help.

09:42.928 --> 09:44.161
From whom?

09:44.229 --> 09:46.364
Who covets
the papal crown?

09:46.465 --> 09:48.466
The great
Roman families:

09:48.567 --> 09:53.538
Colonna, Orsini, Baglioni...

09:53.606 --> 09:55.173
Vitelli.

09:56.975 --> 09:59.878
A dangerous accusation,
my lord.

09:59.945 --> 10:01.612
And one that would need evidence.
Indeed.

10:02.982 --> 10:04.549
Micheletto -
call the night watch.

10:04.617 --> 10:08.353
There was some unpleasantness
in the streets.

10:08.421 --> 10:11.556
And so I shall escort the good
Lord Vitelli safely home.

10:20.534 --> 10:22.468
Rodrigo.

10:22.569 --> 10:24.036
No, no.
It's no good.

10:24.138 --> 10:25.572
Come here.

10:25.639 --> 10:27.473
It's no good!

10:44.758 --> 10:46.725
My love...

10:46.793 --> 10:49.195
it happens to every man
once in a while.

10:49.262 --> 10:50.262
Not to me.

10:50.330 --> 10:52.331
To <i>every</i> man.

10:52.399 --> 10:54.667
Why, have you
known so many?

10:56.002 --> 10:58.471
No.
I'm sorry.

10:58.538 --> 10:59.839
Forgive me.
Forgive me.

10:59.940 --> 11:01.774
Come here.

11:03.176 --> 11:06.579
We have never been
unmanned before.

11:06.646 --> 11:08.847
Maybe it's the poison.

11:10.383 --> 11:12.551
Hm?

11:14.120 --> 11:17.189
I mean, we want you.

11:17.257 --> 11:18.958
We desire you.

11:21.762 --> 11:24.330
You are tired.

11:24.431 --> 11:26.833
You've been
through too much.

11:26.900 --> 11:28.568
We have been
tired before.

11:30.571 --> 11:33.306
We have never been
undone before.

11:37.311 --> 11:38.744
Perhaps it's age.

11:41.348 --> 11:45.317
You are the most vigorous
man I have ever known.

11:45.385 --> 11:47.486
"Was," perhaps.

11:47.553 --> 11:50.388
You are.
And this will pass.

11:56.495 --> 11:59.397
Believe me,
it will pass.

12:13.813 --> 12:15.847
<i>Cardinal Orsini!</i>

12:17.650 --> 12:19.150
Sh, sh, sh.

12:19.218 --> 12:21.618
You could hear
a pin drop, Micheletto.

12:21.686 --> 12:23.520
If I had a pin.

12:24.889 --> 12:26.956
Do you have a pin,
Cardinal?

12:27.024 --> 12:28.892
No, my Lord,
I have no pin.

12:28.959 --> 12:31.494
<i>But you have relatives here.</i>

12:31.562 --> 12:34.096
Could you introduce me
to them?

12:34.164 --> 12:37.533
The Lords Paulo, Roberto Orsini:
Lord Cesare Borgia.

12:37.601 --> 12:41.703
At your service.

12:41.771 --> 12:43.539
May I join you?

12:43.607 --> 12:45.307
Be our guest.

12:45.375 --> 12:47.175
You were here for the game,
I would hazard.

12:48.911 --> 12:52.014
The pope falls ill.
The game begins.

12:52.082 --> 12:56.319
Who will succeed him?
An Orsini?

12:56.386 --> 13:00.356
A Colonna?
A D'Este?

13:00.457 --> 13:02.525
Or, would anyone dare
bet on another Spaniard?

13:05.162 --> 13:07.164
But the pope lives.
<i>Indeed.</i>

13:07.231 --> 13:10.000
The game is over.
For now.

13:10.068 --> 13:13.170
So then why do you still
linger here in Rome?

13:13.271 --> 13:15.372
We like the ruins.

13:15.440 --> 13:17.074
You prefer them to your
castle in Bracciano?

13:17.142 --> 13:18.976
We like that too.

13:19.043 --> 13:21.345
But you must confer with
your cousin, the cardinal.

13:21.413 --> 13:23.213
Which is difficult
in Bracciano.

13:23.281 --> 13:25.015
His business
is in Rome.

13:25.116 --> 13:28.051
Yes, he serves the pope,
in Consistory.

13:28.119 --> 13:29.987
Does that service include

13:30.054 --> 13:32.456
the attempted assassination
of his family?

13:32.524 --> 13:34.491
Be careful, my lord.

13:34.559 --> 13:36.927
I am -
most careful.

13:36.995 --> 13:39.930
I gutted those
incompetent dogs.

13:40.031 --> 13:42.532
Sent by
Catherina Sforza?

13:42.600 --> 13:44.301
By you?

13:44.369 --> 13:46.169
Or by a great
combination of both?

13:51.709 --> 13:56.113
But the pope survived,
thanks be to God.

13:56.180 --> 13:58.081
Here, take it down.

14:12.763 --> 14:17.166
So, be careful with your
calumnies and your accusations.

14:17.234 --> 14:20.536
Rome is a city of rumour.

14:20.604 --> 14:24.940
And you had a brother,
who was murdered.

14:25.007 --> 14:28.643
And rumour has it that
the culprit still lives.

14:28.711 --> 14:30.311
He has yet to be found.

14:30.412 --> 14:31.746
Ah.

14:31.813 --> 14:35.816
Well, perhaps he's here.

14:35.884 --> 14:38.585
Are you accusing me?

14:38.686 --> 14:39.720
Or me?

14:57.940 --> 15:00.308
Come father, come!

15:00.376 --> 15:02.177
Where we going?

15:02.245 --> 15:03.912
That's the mystery. Come!

15:03.980 --> 15:05.947
Ooh!
Come!

15:09.853 --> 15:11.120
Father!

15:11.221 --> 15:14.190
Hold on!

15:14.258 --> 15:15.692
Hold me, Father -

15:15.760 --> 15:17.227
promise you'll hold me!

15:17.294 --> 15:19.495
I...I...

15:23.200 --> 15:25.301
No!
Father!

15:25.369 --> 15:26.869
Juan!

15:30.040 --> 15:33.976
Cesare, Holy Father,
your loving son.

15:38.982 --> 15:40.783
Our only son.

15:43.754 --> 15:47.691
Catherina Sforza
seeks out allies.

15:47.792 --> 15:50.460
Ah.

15:50.528 --> 15:54.631
You've come to talk
to us about spiders.

15:54.699 --> 15:56.700
In an alliance against us -
With whom?

15:56.768 --> 15:59.803
All of them:
the great Roman families.

15:59.905 --> 16:02.239
Hm.

16:02.340 --> 16:06.844
So it is time to act.

16:06.912 --> 16:11.782
To snip those silken threads
from their source.

16:11.883 --> 16:14.918
The great Arachne.

16:14.986 --> 16:20.491
And to give her a lesson
in the elegance of revenge.

16:20.559 --> 16:22.159
Can revenge
be elegant?

16:22.227 --> 16:24.829
Oh, yes.
And eloquent.

16:24.897 --> 16:27.999
We shall begin
with words.

16:28.066 --> 16:31.269
An inquisition,
within these walls.

16:31.370 --> 16:34.072
They will all
cry innocent.

16:34.140 --> 16:38.043
We will have one
interrogate the other.

16:38.144 --> 16:40.279
Interrogate.

16:41.681 --> 16:43.782
And of what do
we accuse them?

16:43.850 --> 16:47.319
Of a hand
in the conspiracy.

16:47.387 --> 16:54.059
To murder our sacred person,
and of our family.

16:54.127 --> 16:56.161
The murder
of your beloved son.

17:00.833 --> 17:05.270
You surpass yourself,
Cesare.

17:05.371 --> 17:07.806
I have a lot
to atone for.

17:09.309 --> 17:10.742
Mm.

17:10.810 --> 17:13.612
We shall start with
he who is closest

17:13.680 --> 17:16.915
to the tarantula
of Forli:

17:17.016 --> 17:19.818
Cardinal Sforza.

17:23.122 --> 17:24.801
Holiness,
I swear by the living God

17:24.857 --> 17:26.959
that I am innocent
in this matter.

17:27.026 --> 17:31.296
I have long forsaken
all ties with my family.

17:31.397 --> 17:33.432
I am a nameless orphan,

17:33.499 --> 17:35.366
in the service of God,
my pope,

17:35.434 --> 17:37.702
and the Borgia family.

17:37.769 --> 17:42.540
You would rather be
a Borgia than a Sforza?

17:42.608 --> 17:44.476
In everything but name,
I already am.

17:44.577 --> 17:48.847
And you wish to prove
to us your innocence?

17:48.948 --> 17:51.016
Your Holiness, I must.

17:53.553 --> 17:56.726
Then find for us

17:59.084 --> 18:01.084
those responsible.

18:01.662 --> 18:03.029
Who else then lies
under suspicion?

18:03.096 --> 18:04.330
Everyone.

18:04.398 --> 18:05.665
Anybody who wears
a red hat.

18:05.733 --> 18:07.100
Interrogate them all.

18:09.570 --> 18:11.104
I am hardly
an inquisitor.

18:11.172 --> 18:13.539
Then become one.

18:13.607 --> 18:16.208
We will cleanse
this Vatican of ours

18:16.276 --> 18:18.811
of anyone who even thinks
to question our fitness

18:18.879 --> 18:20.747
for this most
holy of offices.

18:20.815 --> 18:23.650
Is thought to be
a crime now?

18:25.654 --> 18:28.056
Begin with De Luca.

18:28.123 --> 18:31.760
Threaten him with loss
of office and banishment and -

18:33.563 --> 18:35.964
...he will sing madrigals.

18:36.032 --> 18:37.499
And if he doesn't?

18:37.567 --> 18:39.501
Take him to
the Castel Sant Angelo.

18:39.569 --> 18:42.304
Acquaint him with
the instruments of torture.

18:42.371 --> 18:44.573
You cannot torture
a prince of the church.

18:44.674 --> 18:46.141
I know that.
You know that.

18:46.208 --> 18:48.777
But imagination is
a great persuader.

18:48.844 --> 18:50.412
He saw Savonarola burn.

18:52.548 --> 18:55.785
He'll soon begin to sing -
if he hasn't already -

18:55.886 --> 18:58.854
like a nightingale.

18:58.956 --> 19:00.623
And then?

19:00.691 --> 19:04.961
Then -seize his estates,
strip his red hat.

19:05.029 --> 19:07.897
Banish him
to some hermitage.

19:07.965 --> 19:10.967
And arrest all those
he has implicated.

19:11.035 --> 19:15.137
And start
the process again.

19:15.205 --> 19:18.074
We are in a new world,
Cardinal.

19:33.189 --> 19:35.056
You were married before.

19:35.157 --> 19:36.791
Indeed, my love.

19:36.892 --> 19:39.294
The whole world
knows that.

19:39.361 --> 19:43.331
And yet this child is
not your husband's.

19:43.432 --> 19:46.067
True.

19:46.135 --> 19:48.403
The whole world
knows that too.

19:50.906 --> 19:55.543
If we are to be married,
and happily my love,

19:55.644 --> 19:59.246
we must have no secrets.

19:59.314 --> 20:01.816
Then I have a confession to
make to you, Lucrezia Borgia.

20:01.917 --> 20:04.185
I'm listening.

20:04.253 --> 20:06.621
I saved myself
for marriage.

20:06.689 --> 20:09.457
Ah!
Thank God.

20:09.558 --> 20:11.960
So you are all mine.

20:12.027 --> 20:13.695
You misunderstand me.

20:13.762 --> 20:16.864
I am that most
un-Italian thing.

20:16.932 --> 20:17.732
A virgin.

20:17.833 --> 20:19.167
Oh.

20:19.268 --> 20:23.137
Well, we can soon
put that to rights.

20:23.205 --> 20:25.407
I made a vow
to Saint Agnes.

20:25.474 --> 20:27.642
The patron saint
of purity.

20:27.710 --> 20:30.512
The first woman that
I'd lie with would be my wife.

20:30.580 --> 20:32.280
Well lie with me.

20:32.348 --> 20:35.917
I will be your wife.

20:36.018 --> 20:37.919
Yes, but you are not yet.

20:40.056 --> 20:42.457
Ah.

20:42.525 --> 20:44.726
We must wait then.

20:45.862 --> 20:51.199
Yes, we must wait.

20:51.300 --> 20:53.435
And until that night,

20:53.502 --> 20:56.838
all this beauty
will be just a promise.

20:59.174 --> 21:01.809
Perhaps the poison
is still within you.

21:01.877 --> 21:04.478
Perhaps it strikes
at the root of you.

21:04.546 --> 21:08.048
The doctor said
that the poison is gone.

21:08.116 --> 21:09.650
Perhaps it's
God's punishment:

21:09.751 --> 21:14.688
your lack of vigour.

21:14.756 --> 21:18.125
Or maybe His blessing.

21:18.193 --> 21:22.830
In the past we have striven
to subdue our passions.

21:25.500 --> 21:27.934
Maybe now
we can succeed.

21:33.842 --> 21:36.144
How can we love when
the very air we breathe

21:36.211 --> 21:38.713
is poisoned with
venom and hatred?

21:38.781 --> 21:41.482
And trust no one -
but you?

21:44.620 --> 21:47.488
And we could not protect you
when the assassins struck.

21:47.555 --> 21:49.223
You can't blame
yourself for that.

21:49.324 --> 21:51.024
We are God's
minister on Earth;

21:51.125 --> 21:52.559
He has abandoned us.

21:55.797 --> 21:57.064
If we cannot keep you safe,

21:57.132 --> 21:59.766
we would rather
give up our calling.

22:01.336 --> 22:04.137
Life without the papacy;
what a thought.

22:04.205 --> 22:06.907
But how would you
spend your days?

22:06.974 --> 22:08.275
Tending your vines?

22:08.343 --> 22:12.747
Yes!
Oh!

22:12.814 --> 22:16.017
We would sit together in
the garden in the evening

22:16.085 --> 22:18.286
and watch our
grandchildren grow.

22:18.354 --> 22:20.488
A garden?
We'd have a garden?

22:20.556 --> 22:23.659
Mm.
Flowers, a beehive -

22:25.962 --> 22:28.029
Beehive.

22:28.130 --> 22:30.031
-a soft spring well.

22:30.099 --> 22:32.033
Then we would find peace.

22:35.839 --> 22:39.208
With all that we have, all the
trappings of office and power,

22:39.276 --> 22:44.680
we cannot protect you,
our family.

22:44.748 --> 22:47.583
We would rather be a
peasant in a garden

22:47.650 --> 22:50.486
with a pitchfork -

22:50.553 --> 22:53.421
if that would
keep you safe.

23:01.630 --> 23:04.865
Cardinal De Luca.

23:04.933 --> 23:07.067
<i>I would speak</i>
<i>with you.</i>

23:08.571 --> 23:11.706
He heard every word,
the Holy Father.

23:11.774 --> 23:14.675
Every word, every plot,
every insinuation.

23:14.743 --> 23:18.346
He must know what happens
on the illness of a pope.

23:18.414 --> 23:19.647
He plotted so himself.

23:19.715 --> 23:21.750
This is not just
any ordinary pope.

23:21.817 --> 23:23.457
This is a pope whose
son has been murdered

23:23.486 --> 23:25.153
and whose family almost
died at the same blade.

23:25.254 --> 23:26.755
He will take action.

23:26.823 --> 23:28.156
So tell me,
what must I do?

23:30.093 --> 23:32.595
First,
you must confess.

23:32.663 --> 23:33.596
Well,
I admit it then.

23:33.664 --> 23:36.266
I am guilty.
Of what?

23:37.568 --> 23:40.436
Of avarice -
for advancement.

23:40.537 --> 23:42.238
For, dare I say,
the throne of St. Peter.

23:42.305 --> 23:44.173
Well, that may
not be enough.

23:45.942 --> 23:48.343
Am I guilty of more?

23:50.413 --> 23:52.547
Who murdered
the son?

23:54.584 --> 23:58.253
The world awaits
news on that.

23:58.354 --> 23:59.621
There was a plot

23:59.689 --> 24:01.723
led by Catherina Sforza
and Della Rovere

24:01.791 --> 24:03.925
to rid the earth
of the Borgia family.

24:03.993 --> 24:06.361
The plotters are
in the Vatican walls.

24:09.099 --> 24:12.101
I am a cleric,
Cardinal.

24:12.202 --> 24:13.803
I am adept at strategy;

24:13.871 --> 24:17.207
perhaps arranging votes
on conclave, on committee.

24:17.275 --> 24:19.142
As to my expertise
in murder,

24:19.210 --> 24:23.113
I would plead
incompetence.

24:23.180 --> 24:26.149
You are the cousin
to Catherina Sforza.

24:26.217 --> 24:28.985
The finger of such an accusation
must surely fall on you.

24:29.053 --> 24:30.453
Indeed it does.

24:30.554 --> 24:31.721
Which may well explain

24:31.789 --> 24:34.857
my sense of urgency
in this matter.

24:34.924 --> 24:38.827
When the Holy Father was ill,
he heard no words of mine.

24:41.398 --> 24:43.833
And what are my options?

24:43.900 --> 24:45.701
Confession.

24:45.769 --> 24:48.171
To a crime I would never
even dream of committing?

24:48.238 --> 24:50.873
Then name those who would.
The plotters.

24:50.974 --> 24:53.709
And who are they?

24:53.777 --> 24:56.279
Orsini, Versucci, Colonna.
Pick who you will.

24:56.347 --> 24:58.615
It doesn't matter.
They all wanted him dead.

25:00.551 --> 25:01.952
I could never.

25:02.019 --> 25:05.221
Yes, I know; the very
thought seems outrageous.

25:05.289 --> 25:08.992
But we must learn how
outrage becomes normality.

25:24.509 --> 25:27.644
This Vatican of ours
has changed...

25:27.712 --> 25:29.646
...forever.

25:32.817 --> 25:35.819
Follow me.

25:35.887 --> 25:37.587
Follow you where?

25:39.257 --> 25:41.391
Into the future.

25:47.031 --> 25:48.632
Am I, a prince of the church,

25:48.700 --> 25:50.367
to be to put to the rack?

25:50.435 --> 25:52.269
The very thought appalls me.

25:52.337 --> 25:54.771
But there are others
less delicate than I.

25:57.308 --> 25:58.909
So perhaps these
instruments of torture

25:58.977 --> 26:01.211
may act as an aid
to contemplation.

26:04.483 --> 26:06.584
Cardinal Sforza,
Cardinal Sforza,

26:06.685 --> 26:08.118
Cardinal Sforza, please!

26:08.186 --> 26:09.653
Please, Cardinal Sforza!

26:09.721 --> 26:11.222
Please,
Cardinal Sforza!

26:11.289 --> 26:12.957
Cardinal Sforza!

26:13.058 --> 26:14.658
Sforza!

26:18.296 --> 26:22.465
NO!
Sforza!

26:31.242 --> 26:34.411
May I enter?

26:34.479 --> 26:37.047
Will modesty allow it?

26:37.148 --> 26:39.416
Please.

26:43.354 --> 26:46.223
Little Giovanni.

26:46.324 --> 26:48.259
He's a virgin.

26:48.327 --> 26:51.295
He will punish me cruelly.

26:51.363 --> 26:53.398
He will
make me wait.

26:55.267 --> 26:56.902
Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh.

26:56.969 --> 26:59.604
I have had word from my uncle,

26:59.705 --> 27:02.608
King Ferdinand of Naples.

27:02.675 --> 27:04.243
Observe.

27:04.310 --> 27:08.180
The sleep of the innocent.

27:08.248 --> 27:10.583
You have come to
kiss him good night?

27:12.686 --> 27:15.154
Or to kiss me?

27:20.027 --> 27:25.884
My uncle's letter
mentioned him: the child.

27:28.202 --> 27:30.136
The child?

27:30.204 --> 27:32.606
Neither mine nor
your husband's.

27:32.674 --> 27:35.075
What of it?

27:38.947 --> 27:42.349
My uncle has expressed his
disquiet at the thought of...

27:42.417 --> 27:43.718
The thought of?

27:43.785 --> 27:45.186
The thought of a child
without legitimacy

27:45.287 --> 27:46.921
in the palace of Naples.

27:46.989 --> 27:49.624
Well, you and your uncle will
have to agree to disagree then.

27:49.725 --> 27:51.859
Of course.

27:51.927 --> 27:54.529
You would never -
Who negotiates your dowry?

27:57.533 --> 27:59.201
My brother.

28:01.537 --> 28:05.340
Well, then I must go
to him and insist that -

28:05.408 --> 28:08.109
Perhaps I should broach
the matter with him.

28:08.210 --> 28:10.612
You?

28:10.679 --> 28:13.081
My brother's passions
can be intense

28:13.149 --> 28:15.384
where issues of family
are concerned.

28:16.352 --> 28:27.728
[♪]

28:36.138 --> 28:38.072
Oh.

29:02.764 --> 29:04.666
Why have you forsaken me?

29:06.503 --> 29:08.103
Why have you
forsaken me?

29:12.609 --> 29:15.377
You are in the house of lies.

29:15.445 --> 29:18.514
The devil's house?

29:18.581 --> 29:20.282
Think of them
as your friends.

29:22.019 --> 29:23.853
The rack?

29:23.921 --> 29:25.321
The iron maiden?

29:28.492 --> 29:31.127
They have a message
for you.

29:31.195 --> 29:33.296
You have used them,
I am sure.

29:33.397 --> 29:35.498
I have suffered on them.

29:35.566 --> 29:39.402
Your inquisitor believes
that they elicit the truth.

29:39.470 --> 29:42.272
They do not.

29:42.340 --> 29:45.042
A man will say anything
on the rack to make it end.

29:47.879 --> 29:49.213
Then why am I here?

29:49.314 --> 29:51.215
To learn to lie.

29:51.316 --> 29:53.584
To say whatever is needed.

29:53.652 --> 29:56.153
To avoid their embrace.

29:58.723 --> 30:00.691
You are to
negotiate my dowry, Brother.

30:00.792 --> 30:02.426
With his uncle.

30:02.493 --> 30:04.328
The King of Naples; yes.

30:04.395 --> 30:08.699
So must I trade one
love for another?

30:10.969 --> 30:12.236
Leave us.

30:12.304 --> 30:13.704
My lord.

30:15.006 --> 30:17.408
Do you mean me for him?

30:20.846 --> 30:22.246
That too.

30:22.314 --> 30:26.316
What do you mean?

30:26.384 --> 30:28.686
I mean my son,
Giovanni.

30:28.754 --> 30:32.156
His presence in Naples
might be unwelcome.

30:32.257 --> 30:33.691
Ah.

30:33.758 --> 30:35.859
I could have seen
that coming.

30:35.927 --> 30:37.795
The King of Naples feels

30:37.862 --> 30:39.763
that one cannot carry
into one marriage

30:39.831 --> 30:41.598
baggage from the last.

30:41.666 --> 30:42.966
Is your son
baggage to you?

30:43.033 --> 30:44.434
No.

30:44.501 --> 30:46.569
He's the light
of my life.

30:46.637 --> 30:50.172
Well, you could insist.
I will, as must you.

30:51.574 --> 30:53.675
But you must
make the case

30:53.743 --> 30:57.879
for the son of a stable
boy in a royal household.

30:57.947 --> 31:00.883
Listen.

31:00.984 --> 31:02.885
You are Lucrezia Borgia.

31:02.986 --> 31:06.121
You are the
scandal of Italy.

31:06.189 --> 31:07.956
You are also
the envy of Italy.

31:08.024 --> 31:10.893
And soon to be
a princess of Aragon.

31:10.960 --> 31:12.862
Whoever gets in the
way of your happiness

31:12.929 --> 31:14.864
will meet my wrath.

31:19.236 --> 31:22.172
We are the unholy family.

31:31.348 --> 31:34.183
Let him know that.

31:36.987 --> 31:39.155
I fear he knows already.

31:40.691 --> 31:44.528
He will love you,
he will serve you,

31:44.595 --> 31:47.097
and if Naples dares to
take your son from you,

31:47.198 --> 31:48.599
I promise...

31:48.666 --> 31:50.801
it will never know peace again.

31:52.870 --> 31:55.105
Can I get help, please?

31:56.441 --> 31:58.208
Help now!

31:58.276 --> 31:59.543
<i>Yes, my lord!</i>

32:07.519 --> 32:09.920
Did you sleep?

32:24.003 --> 32:25.838
But I dreamed,
Cardinal.

32:25.906 --> 32:29.108
You dreamt without sleeping?

32:29.209 --> 32:31.177
Now that is miraculous.

32:31.245 --> 32:34.080
Call it a waking dream.

32:37.351 --> 32:39.119
Tell me.

32:41.222 --> 32:43.223
I dreamed of
a vast conspiracy

32:43.291 --> 32:45.759
encircling our
beloved Vatican.

32:45.827 --> 32:48.362
It has its roots in
the hills of the Romagna,

32:48.429 --> 32:49.829
in the great families

32:49.897 --> 32:52.131
that would claim
St. Peter's as their own.

32:54.068 --> 32:55.602
And its tendrils spread

32:55.670 --> 32:59.039
like writhing serpents
through the streets of Rome,

32:59.106 --> 33:05.378
breaking inside the
Vatican walls...

33:05.445 --> 33:12.251
where it becomes a
many-headed hydra

33:12.318 --> 33:16.688
and each head wears
a cardinal's hat.

33:16.756 --> 33:18.756
Why don't you
tell me more?

33:23.362 --> 33:25.029
Lucrezia?

33:25.097 --> 33:26.297
<i>Is that my brother?</i>

33:26.365 --> 33:27.732
Yes.

33:27.799 --> 33:29.100
<i>The brother</i>
<i>who loves me?</i>

33:29.167 --> 33:30.568
The same.

33:30.635 --> 33:32.670
<i>Come in then.</i>
<i>See my wedding gown.</i>

33:35.941 --> 33:37.876
God, um -
Come closer, Brother.

33:40.646 --> 33:42.514
My gown.

33:42.615 --> 33:44.148
Do you approve?

33:46.318 --> 33:49.153
The gold is
um... divine.

33:59.364 --> 34:01.999
I - I should leave, Sis -
Why?

34:02.100 --> 34:03.700
Am I ugly,
Brother?

34:03.768 --> 34:08.871
The man who makes that claim
will lose his tongue.

34:08.973 --> 34:11.341
My foot.

34:11.442 --> 34:14.143
It is ungainly?

34:14.245 --> 34:15.579
Too large, perhaps?

34:15.647 --> 34:17.981
Your foot
is beautiful.

34:18.049 --> 34:19.583
You can't tell
from there.

34:19.650 --> 34:21.052
Feel it.

34:32.130 --> 34:33.530
Is this a game?

34:33.632 --> 34:34.931
It is a game

34:35.000 --> 34:38.703
of want
and wanting.

34:41.273 --> 34:44.909
The toes are
splayed a little.

34:46.879 --> 34:48.239
God has made better feet,
I'm sure.

34:48.248 --> 34:50.616
Not that I have found.

34:50.684 --> 34:52.117
You are a connoisseur
of feet.

34:52.185 --> 34:54.320
Yes. And I have found
none better.

34:58.157 --> 35:00.726
My calf.

35:00.794 --> 35:03.695
Is it elegant?

35:03.763 --> 35:08.867
Is it smooth?

35:08.935 --> 35:10.635
What is this game, Sis?

35:13.005 --> 35:16.808
My betrothed
will not bed me.

35:16.876 --> 35:19.143
He will not touch me.

35:19.211 --> 35:20.812
He is a virgin.

35:20.913 --> 35:22.614
You have the means

35:22.681 --> 35:24.616
to change that history,
I'm sure.

35:24.717 --> 35:27.652
Are you sure?

35:27.720 --> 35:31.189
That this body has
the necessary charms?

35:38.163 --> 35:40.198
I am certain.

35:40.299 --> 35:43.268
He has made a vow
to St. Agnes,

35:43.336 --> 35:45.804
the patron saint
of purity -

35:45.871 --> 35:49.174
to remain chaste
until married.

35:49.242 --> 35:51.643
Unwise.

35:56.149 --> 35:59.284
I am a Borgia.

35:59.385 --> 36:02.487
And I feel unloved.

36:02.588 --> 36:05.089
Positively foolish.

36:08.094 --> 36:11.363
You look but don't touch.

36:17.002 --> 36:18.169
<i>My lady.</i>

36:18.237 --> 36:19.938
Ah!

36:20.005 --> 36:22.307
<i>My lady, your fitting.</i>

36:22.374 --> 36:25.476
That will be the dressmakers
to fit my wedding dress.

36:28.447 --> 36:31.082
You must leave us, Brother.
Yes...

36:31.150 --> 36:33.084
For delicacy's sake.

36:33.152 --> 36:35.119
Yes, of course.

36:39.791 --> 36:41.859
Come in!

36:44.463 --> 36:46.530
There was a conspiracy,
Holy Father,

36:46.598 --> 36:51.969
devised by the mistress
of Forli, Catherina Sforza.

36:52.037 --> 36:53.871
But it is a conspiracy
so vast

36:53.939 --> 36:56.408
that we have no doubt
that she had help.

36:56.509 --> 36:58.777
From within these walls?

36:58.845 --> 37:01.913
Indeed.

37:01.981 --> 37:03.949
And have no doubt,
Holy Father,

37:04.017 --> 37:06.018
that he that denies such
a conspiracy existed

37:06.086 --> 37:08.120
was part of the
conspiracy himself.

37:14.094 --> 37:16.763
We had feared
as much.

37:16.831 --> 37:19.266
A vast many-headed
hydra,

37:19.333 --> 37:21.768
spreading from the
families of the Romagna

37:21.836 --> 37:25.705
and each head wears
a cardinal's hat.

37:33.948 --> 37:36.016
The end was plain:

37:36.083 --> 37:39.518
the murder of you
and your entire family.

37:39.586 --> 37:42.054
In the instance of
your most sacred person,

37:42.122 --> 37:43.789
it almost succeeded.

37:44.791 --> 37:48.027
In the instance of your
beloved son, Juan Borgia,

37:48.094 --> 37:50.062
it succeeded
only too well.

37:52.666 --> 37:55.867
<i>And the conspirators?</i>

37:55.935 --> 37:58.703
Are they amongst us here?

37:58.804 --> 38:00.138
They are, Holy Father.

38:01.841 --> 38:03.208
And most shamefully,

38:03.276 --> 38:05.577
I must count myself
amongst their number.

38:07.914 --> 38:09.448
Your honesty is noted.

38:09.516 --> 38:12.318
<i>But you must name names,</i>
<i>Cardinal.</i>

38:16.990 --> 38:19.992
Cardinal Francesco
Todeschini Piccolomini.

38:20.093 --> 38:21.327
Liar!

38:21.395 --> 38:23.062
Accuse yourself,
De Luca

38:23.130 --> 38:26.165
and that perfidious
Orsini!

38:26.233 --> 38:28.868
Cardinal Giovanni
Battista Orsini.

38:28.936 --> 38:30.537
These are false
accusations coming from -

38:30.605 --> 38:32.339
Cardinal Rocca Colonna.

38:33.407 --> 38:35.408
Julius Versucci!

38:35.476 --> 38:38.278
I have been party to no
conspiracy, Your Holiness!

38:55.230 --> 38:57.899
Those cardinals,

38:57.966 --> 39:03.138
those who have betrayed
our sacred trust -

39:03.205 --> 39:06.975
will be stripped
of their offices and titles,

39:07.042 --> 39:09.043
their properties
confiscated

39:09.111 --> 39:11.646
and returned to our
Holy Mother Church.

39:13.382 --> 39:16.418
They will be forbidden entry
through the gates of Rome,

39:16.485 --> 39:22.256
and live under censure
for the rest of their days.

39:25.760 --> 39:28.361
Is this why
you would speak with me?

39:28.462 --> 39:30.730
I who was once you.

39:30.798 --> 39:33.199
You who will become me.

39:33.301 --> 39:36.036
Should I resign myself?

39:36.103 --> 39:38.071
To being a mistress
discarded?

39:38.138 --> 39:39.538
I should be hating you,

39:39.606 --> 39:41.574
not providing
a sympathetic ear.

39:41.675 --> 39:43.209
Advise me then.

39:45.579 --> 39:47.913
Is there another?

39:49.016 --> 39:50.983
Not that I know.

39:51.051 --> 39:52.919
Perhaps it is you,
then.

39:54.255 --> 39:58.525
Something has
changed between us.

39:58.593 --> 40:00.394
I have felt it
for some time.

40:02.396 --> 40:04.197
Does he still love you?

40:05.699 --> 40:07.199
I hope.

40:08.769 --> 40:12.905
Perhaps you'll find,
as I have that...

40:12.972 --> 40:14.373
love deepens,

40:14.441 --> 40:16.308
regardless of whether
you share the same bed.

40:19.379 --> 40:22.180
You mean I may find it
is truly over between us?

40:23.916 --> 40:25.616
Perhaps.

40:25.684 --> 40:28.286
Then you must
state your terms.

40:28.354 --> 40:31.856
Negotiate your exit.

40:31.923 --> 40:34.458
What would you have from him,
if not his passion?

40:38.230 --> 40:40.665
A palace like yours.

40:40.732 --> 40:42.033
That's easy.

40:42.134 --> 40:43.301
The cardinals are
falling like flies.

40:43.369 --> 40:45.403
And...

40:45.504 --> 40:47.238
a cardinal's hat.

40:47.339 --> 40:48.773
For you?

40:48.840 --> 40:50.475
Have you no shame?

40:52.411 --> 40:53.944
For my brother.

40:55.747 --> 40:58.782
Do you think
she'd be happy here?

40:58.884 --> 41:01.919
La Farnese?

41:01.987 --> 41:04.522
So she's to be
banished from your life then?

41:04.589 --> 41:08.993
No.

41:09.061 --> 41:14.032
But a little distance
might be beneficial...

41:14.099 --> 41:15.767
between us.

41:15.835 --> 41:19.070
Have you told
her that?

41:19.171 --> 41:22.507
I did mention it.

41:22.608 --> 41:26.944
And?

41:27.012 --> 41:29.680
She was upset,

41:29.748 --> 41:31.582
but the tears
didn't last long.

41:31.650 --> 41:33.118
I mean,
I think she was...

41:35.087 --> 41:39.591
relieved, maybe,
to be released from us.

41:39.659 --> 41:41.527
Everything has its end.

41:48.702 --> 41:50.803
Whose palace
was this?

41:50.871 --> 41:52.238
Oh...

41:52.306 --> 41:55.909
one of the cardinals
who betrayed me.

41:55.977 --> 41:58.278
It'll take more than
a palace to keep her happy.

41:58.346 --> 42:00.313
Have you spoken
to her?

42:00.381 --> 42:02.616
She told me
that your vigour

42:02.683 --> 42:03.883
had somewhat
diminished.

42:05.386 --> 42:07.620
I told her I couldn't
imagine such a thing.

42:07.722 --> 42:10.189
As I said before,

42:10.257 --> 42:11.891
it's a blessing
in disguise.

42:13.294 --> 42:14.861
Why do you laugh?

42:16.363 --> 42:19.232
Because my life without you

42:19.300 --> 42:21.434
has turned out to be another
blessing in disguise.

42:29.944 --> 42:33.513
We are both blessed then.

42:33.581 --> 42:35.415
Together we're cursed.

42:35.483 --> 42:36.917
Hm...

42:36.984 --> 42:39.352
But apart,

42:39.453 --> 42:41.554
at least I'm at peace.

42:57.806 --> 43:00.441
My God, what a bed.

43:00.508 --> 43:02.009
It would fit
the whole Consistory.

43:03.645 --> 43:05.479
Perhaps it did.

43:06.915 --> 43:08.449
What?

43:08.550 --> 43:10.618
This is a rare pleasure.

43:10.686 --> 43:13.087
Alone together.

43:17.326 --> 43:20.729
We find ourselves becoming
a little agitated.

43:24.634 --> 43:26.202
You should call the guard.

43:26.303 --> 43:28.204
We lack the voice.

43:32.376 --> 43:34.311
Cappretino.

43:35.847 --> 43:37.848
Little goat.

43:37.916 --> 43:40.217
It's been a long time
since you called me that.

43:40.285 --> 43:41.765
Well, every now and
then I whisper it.

43:45.490 --> 43:47.725
But rarely.

43:53.765 --> 43:56.800
Ah no, no,
no, no, no.

43:56.868 --> 43:59.302
You lack the vigour,
remember?

44:04.942 --> 44:07.310
It would appear
no longer.

44:13.217 --> 44:16.420
So the cause was not
the poison, my love.

44:16.521 --> 44:17.921
It would appear not.

44:20.224 --> 44:22.392
You know...

44:22.493 --> 44:25.329
We feel safe with you.

44:29.801 --> 44:32.770
As if we've come home.

44:34.505 --> 44:38.675
These offices
I relinquish willingly.

44:38.743 --> 44:41.845
These estates
I place in the care

44:41.913 --> 44:44.014
of our Holy Mother Church.

44:49.154 --> 44:52.023
This hat...

44:52.090 --> 44:56.594
I now return to the hands
that blessed me with it.

44:59.097 --> 45:01.032
In nomine Patris et Fillii
et Spiritus Sancti.

45:01.099 --> 45:02.233
Amen.

45:02.334 --> 45:06.671
But I would ask
one last blessing

45:06.739 --> 45:08.573
before I leave our
beloved Vatican forever.

45:11.544 --> 45:13.878
Confession.

45:13.946 --> 45:16.380
I would confess to
the pope's ear alone,

45:16.448 --> 45:18.216
and be absolved
of my heinous sins

45:18.283 --> 45:19.984
by the successor
to St. Peter.

45:20.052 --> 45:21.987
Now?
Yes.

45:22.055 --> 45:23.489
This is most irregular.

45:23.556 --> 45:26.124
The business of defrocking
alone will take hours...

45:26.192 --> 45:27.493
Your Holiness,

45:27.560 --> 45:28.894
I have been asked to
effect my retirement

45:28.962 --> 45:31.430
with maximum
and unseemly haste.

45:31.498 --> 45:33.465
I have complied.

45:33.533 --> 45:37.036
If my request is granted,
I will be gone forever.

45:37.103 --> 45:38.971
You need never set
eyes on me again.

45:39.039 --> 45:40.272
Well...

45:40.373 --> 45:41.540
Please...

45:43.010 --> 45:44.610
Please.

45:49.216 --> 45:50.616
We grant this blessing.

45:50.684 --> 45:52.051
<i>No!</i>

45:52.119 --> 45:54.453
With the utmost efficacy.

45:56.022 --> 45:58.890
Cardinal Sforza,
take our place.

46:17.577 --> 46:23.081
Bless me, Your Holiness,
for I have sinned.

46:23.182 --> 46:25.450
And my sins are many.

46:25.517 --> 46:29.520
But the greatest
of them...

46:29.588 --> 46:31.456
is this murder.

46:31.523 --> 46:32.757
Murder?

46:32.824 --> 46:36.527
I must protest
against this outrage!

46:38.297 --> 46:41.299
This hat is red as a
symbol of our willingness

46:41.367 --> 46:45.469
to spill our blood in defence
of our Holy Mother Church!

46:45.537 --> 46:46.938
Whose murder?

46:47.039 --> 46:48.639
A murder yet...

46:48.740 --> 46:49.907
to be committed!

46:57.683 --> 47:01.552
For which the whole world
will grant me forgiveness!

47:07.492 --> 47:10.661
And I return it willingly

47:10.729 --> 47:13.030
since there is
nothing of value -

47:14.399 --> 47:18.869
No residue of honour,
of goodness,

47:18.937 --> 47:21.672
of sanctity
left to defend!

47:28.313 --> 47:29.480
Ah!

47:33.552 --> 47:34.852
Ah!

47:34.920 --> 47:37.288
There will be
rejoicing in the Heavens

47:37.356 --> 47:40.925
as Hell welcomes you
with open arms...

47:45.998 --> 47:47.599
May it lie in the filth

47:47.666 --> 47:50.502
which will be
its deserved home!

47:53.306 --> 47:56.008
I'll gladly die with you.

48:08.189 --> 48:09.223
Ah!

48:12.828 --> 48:15.196
As you sink
into the darkness -

48:15.264 --> 48:17.064
call out His name,

48:17.166 --> 48:19.267
see if He replies.

48:19.335 --> 48:25.307
Or if you must
hear the eternal silence.

48:26.776 --> 48:28.243
Next!

48:28.311 --> 48:30.146
Cardinal Colonna!

48:31.748 --> 48:33.483
This is one endless
confession.

48:38.655 --> 48:46.327
[♪]

48:47.163 --> 48:49.397
Close the door.

49:00.710 --> 49:02.811
God must want us to live.

49:02.879 --> 49:12.621
