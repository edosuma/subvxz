WEBVTT

00:03.904 --> 00:06.716
- Are you sure you want to poke the bear?
- I want to rip his heart out.

00:06.740 --> 00:09.743
All-new episodes
of Proven Innocent Fridays.

00:09.777 --> 00:11.545
And check out
our other hit shows...

00:11.579 --> 00:14.315
The Resident, 9-1-1, and Empire.

00:14.348 --> 00:15.916
Only on Fox.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.752
Previously on Proven Innocent...

00:18.786 --> 00:20.588
- You played me.
- Baby.

00:20.621 --> 00:21.631
Why'd you have to ruin this?

00:21.655 --> 00:22.623
Heather Dupinski...

00:22.656 --> 00:23.924
She connected all of us.

00:23.957 --> 00:25.359
There was something
really special

00:25.393 --> 00:26.927
when we first started hanging.

00:26.960 --> 00:29.797
If you had new evidence
of her guilt, then you would win

00:29.830 --> 00:31.031
in a landslide.

00:31.065 --> 00:32.533
You mean,
recharge her for murder?

00:32.566 --> 00:34.635
You can tell me.
I won't say anything.

00:34.668 --> 00:36.604
The night that-that Rosemary
was killed,

00:36.637 --> 00:38.939
everybody's looking for her,
except for Madeline.

00:38.972 --> 00:40.016
My lawyer actually thinks
I'm gonna have

00:40.040 --> 00:41.342
a shot at getting out of here.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.344
Do you really see us together
out there?

00:44.612 --> 00:46.180
Yeah, I do.

01:01.862 --> 01:02.996
No!

01:13.207 --> 01:16.076
Morning.

01:19.180 --> 01:21.349
Hey. You okay?

01:21.382 --> 01:23.851
I'm fine.

01:23.884 --> 01:25.386
Just got a little lonely
up there.

01:25.419 --> 01:28.055
I'm sorry.

01:35.696 --> 01:38.199
Did you call your P.O.
last night?

01:38.232 --> 01:40.334
Tell her you were gonna spend
the night here?

01:40.368 --> 01:42.736
- Not yet.
- Wren.

01:42.770 --> 01:44.438
Chill. I will, I promise.

01:44.472 --> 01:46.374
I don't want you getting
your parole revoked.

01:46.407 --> 01:48.876
There's no way
I'm going back there.

01:48.909 --> 01:51.679
I enjoyed last night
way too much.

01:53.781 --> 01:56.317
It was nice finally getting
to take our time, right?

02:02.223 --> 02:04.158
Crap.

02:04.192 --> 02:05.859
I got to get up.

02:05.893 --> 02:08.262
So do you, right?

02:08.295 --> 02:09.729
Don't you have
some job interviews?

02:09.763 --> 02:11.465
I'm not really interested

02:11.499 --> 02:13.301
in the jobs the halfway house
is offering.

02:13.334 --> 02:16.237
Wren, you have to work
as a condition of your parole.

02:16.270 --> 02:19.773
I know, but I just...
I don't know.

02:19.807 --> 02:21.875
Why don't you come work with me?

02:21.909 --> 02:24.077
Yeah, we're looking
for a new office clerk.

02:24.111 --> 02:26.046
No. I-I don't want
any special favors.

02:26.079 --> 02:28.482
Well, I do.

02:28.516 --> 02:30.117
So come work at IDG.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.819
You'll be great.

02:31.852 --> 02:34.054
You sure you're ready
to mix those worlds?

02:34.087 --> 02:37.090
Introducing your coworkers to
your secret ex-con girlfriend?

02:37.124 --> 02:38.426
Really?

02:38.459 --> 02:40.794
Really.

02:40.828 --> 02:42.129
Yes, really.

02:42.162 --> 02:44.031
Nope.

02:44.064 --> 02:45.132
Stop.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.634
I have to go to work.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.369
We have to go to work.

02:52.640 --> 02:53.907
Get up.

03:00.681 --> 03:03.517
Well there's something
that's gotten a lot easier.

03:03.551 --> 03:04.785
Making coffee.

03:04.818 --> 03:06.287
Yep, it's just
a push of a button.

03:06.320 --> 03:08.822
Also, we've got flavored creamer
and Stevia.

03:08.856 --> 03:10.157
There's snacks and pop.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.959
Morning.

03:11.992 --> 03:13.994
Easy Boudreau. Wren Grant.

03:14.027 --> 03:16.264
So you're the lawyer
who stole her away from me.

03:16.297 --> 03:18.599
You remember me telling you
about Wren?

03:18.632 --> 03:20.200
Yeah. Your prison buddy,

03:20.234 --> 03:22.403
slash protector,
slash confidant.

03:22.436 --> 03:23.704
Slash very good friend.

03:29.310 --> 03:32.179
This must be our newest
ex-con law clerk.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.714
You guys have had others?

03:33.747 --> 03:35.316
We still do.

03:35.349 --> 03:37.618
A lot of our clients
have trouble finding jobs

03:37.651 --> 03:40.388
even though they've been
exonerated, so they work here.

03:40.421 --> 03:41.655
True story.

03:41.689 --> 03:43.324
I'm Bodie Quick.

03:43.357 --> 03:44.757
- You want the "Quick" tour?
- Sure.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.333
You must be
Lieutenant Commander Tate.

03:52.366 --> 03:53.701
And you must be Madeline Scott.

03:53.734 --> 03:55.369
That I am.

03:55.403 --> 03:57.070
And I'd guess
you're Easy Boudreau.

03:57.104 --> 03:58.506
You'd guess right.

03:58.539 --> 04:00.508
Let's find a place
where we can talk.

04:00.541 --> 04:03.143
Her name is Rachel Clarke.

04:03.176 --> 04:06.079
A seaman in the Naval Special
Warfare Preparatory School.

04:07.381 --> 04:08.849
She looks badass.

04:08.882 --> 04:11.719
She was. Is.

04:11.752 --> 04:13.220
The prep school
is the first stop

04:13.253 --> 04:15.222
for any sailor who wants
to become a SEAL.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.534
And Rachel would've been one
of the first females accepted

04:17.558 --> 04:20.060
into BUD/S... Navy SEAL school.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.894
Instead she was convicted
of murder.

04:21.928 --> 04:24.231
Four years ago
she was court-martialed

04:24.264 --> 04:25.766
for murdering
her naval instructor,

04:25.799 --> 04:27.301
Petty Officer Chris Moore.

04:27.335 --> 04:30.037
Two Silver Stars, Purple Heart.

04:30.070 --> 04:31.572
Moore was highly decorated.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.607
Beyond that, he was the base
admiral's son-in-law.

04:33.641 --> 04:36.043
I don't need to tell you
this was a huge case.

04:36.076 --> 04:39.780
But you're here, so I'm guessing
you think the Navy got it wrong?

04:39.813 --> 04:41.615
Well, Clarke was at the top
of her class.

04:41.649 --> 04:43.126
The embodiment
of military excellence.

04:43.150 --> 04:44.418
Never disciplined once.

04:44.452 --> 04:46.186
She was the perfect candidate.

04:46.219 --> 04:48.789
- What do you think happened?
- I think Clarke was railroaded.

04:48.822 --> 04:51.725
The Navy isn't too excited
to have a female SEAL.

04:51.759 --> 04:54.328
They had an unsolved murder
and they pinned it on her.

05:09.176 --> 05:11.945
We have a staff meeting,
Mr. Bellows.

05:14.648 --> 05:17.385
If you don't mind me asking,
what is all this?

05:17.418 --> 05:19.453
Case files from the original
Scott trial.

05:19.487 --> 05:21.254
And why is it all here?

05:21.288 --> 05:22.956
I have it brought up
on occasion.

05:22.990 --> 05:25.459
When the mood strikes.

05:25.493 --> 05:28.195
You see, Isabel,
it always comes down to this

05:28.228 --> 05:31.298
No matter how we build it,
without the murder weapon

05:31.331 --> 05:33.300
that was used
against Rosemary Lynch,

05:33.333 --> 05:37.137
any new case against
Madeline Scott is a nonstarter.

05:38.138 --> 05:39.607
Where are you with Levi?

05:39.640 --> 05:41.241
I've gained his trust,

05:41.274 --> 05:43.811
but I'm not sure he has
anything relevant to say.

05:45.646 --> 05:48.516
He did mention Cathedral Cove.

05:48.549 --> 05:50.117
What about it?

05:50.150 --> 05:52.185
The night of Rosemary's murder,

05:52.219 --> 05:54.822
Levi said that everyone went
looking for her.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.289
Everyone except for Madeline.

05:56.323 --> 05:58.759
- Yes, and...?
- And he said that Cathedral Cove

05:58.792 --> 06:01.128
was Madeline and Rosemary's
favorite place.

06:01.161 --> 06:03.096
That they'd sit out there
for hours.

06:03.130 --> 06:05.365
What if, while everyone
was out looking for Rosemary,

06:05.399 --> 06:07.701
Madeline was at the cove?

06:07.735 --> 06:10.671
Potentially disposing
of the murder weapon?

06:10.704 --> 06:13.006
It's a possibility.

06:15.008 --> 06:17.478
You know, I've considered
dredging Quarry Lake

06:17.511 --> 06:19.980
in the past. It's-it's
a massive undertaking.

06:20.013 --> 06:23.551
But if I were to limit
the size of the scope

06:23.584 --> 06:26.887
to a small cove...

06:52.045 --> 06:54.682
I've been prepping to be
a Navy SEAL since I was ten.

06:54.715 --> 06:58.218
I saw these heroes on TV,
all of 'em brave men.

06:58.251 --> 07:00.087
And I wanted that, too.

07:00.120 --> 07:01.798
But because I was born a woman,
I've been through more crap

07:01.822 --> 07:03.557
than you could possibly imagine.

07:03.591 --> 07:04.958
Her reviews were stellar

07:04.992 --> 07:06.494
since she first became
a candidate.

07:06.527 --> 07:08.228
Future couldn't have been
brighter.

07:08.261 --> 07:09.429
They said you lost control.

07:09.463 --> 07:11.031
You snapped and killed Moore.

07:11.064 --> 07:13.000
- That's a lie.
- But you did have a fight

07:13.033 --> 07:15.268
with him the night
that he was murdered.

07:15.302 --> 07:16.970
And the case file said
you were drinking.

07:17.004 --> 07:19.740
I'd just finished PT

07:19.773 --> 07:22.075
and I was just trying to unwind.

07:22.109 --> 07:24.612
And maybe I did have
one too many.

07:24.645 --> 07:26.379
But then Moore got all up
in my face

07:26.413 --> 07:28.124
with the whole
"girls can't be SEALs" thing.

07:28.148 --> 07:31.118
And we argued, but that was it.

07:31.151 --> 07:32.352
The murder weapon was found

07:32.385 --> 07:33.887
in your wall locker
the next morning.

07:33.921 --> 07:37.725
The day before
we had an inspection.

07:37.758 --> 07:39.636
They dug through
every square inch of my locker.

07:39.660 --> 07:41.228
And there was no gun.

07:41.261 --> 07:43.897
So, what... I got into some
little pissing match with Moore

07:43.931 --> 07:46.433
at the bar,
drove drunk into town,

07:46.466 --> 07:48.736
found someone to sell me
an unlicensed firearm,

07:48.769 --> 07:50.738
drove back to base, shot him,

07:50.771 --> 07:52.606
and then after all that, what...

07:52.640 --> 07:55.609
Threw the weapon into my
wall locker and went to sleep?

07:55.643 --> 07:57.945
So, obviously, you think
the gun was planted.

07:57.978 --> 08:00.147
- Hell yeah, I think it was.
- Why?

08:00.180 --> 08:01.582
Because I stood out.

08:01.615 --> 08:04.317
My dad was in the Army.

08:04.351 --> 08:06.086
I know all about "the club."

08:06.119 --> 08:07.855
But if the Navy wanted you out,

08:07.888 --> 08:10.090
they could've just made up
an excuse to kick you out.

08:10.123 --> 08:12.359
Framing you for murder
is really extreme.

08:12.392 --> 08:14.361
The admiral's son-in-law
was dead.

08:14.394 --> 08:16.163
All right?

08:16.196 --> 08:17.765
They, they needed
to arrest someone.

08:17.798 --> 08:19.332
So why not have it be me?

08:19.366 --> 08:21.669
There's actually
a more logical explanation.

08:21.702 --> 08:22.903
Which is?

08:22.936 --> 08:24.705
The real murderer framed you.

08:26.740 --> 08:28.609
On this week's.

08:28.642 --> 08:30.277
Until Proven Innocent,

08:30.310 --> 08:33.145
we will tell the story
of Rachel Clarke.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.815
One of the few female SEAL
candidates

08:34.847 --> 08:37.284
in the history of this country.

08:37.317 --> 08:39.186
To get as far as Rachel did,

08:39.219 --> 08:42.722
she had to be sound
in both body and mind.

08:42.756 --> 08:45.458
But the Navy said she snapped.

08:45.492 --> 08:47.360
That she lost it.

08:47.394 --> 08:48.796
How did it happen?

08:48.829 --> 08:51.298
This is a story about secrets.

08:51.331 --> 08:54.668
Did Rachel have something
terrible stirring inside of her?

08:54.702 --> 08:56.369
Or is the real secret

08:56.403 --> 08:59.339
about why an innocent woman

08:59.372 --> 09:02.042
was cut down before
she was given a chance

09:02.075 --> 09:04.411
to truly fulfill
her dream in life?

09:07.047 --> 09:08.949
- Typical.
- What?

09:08.982 --> 09:10.517
I'm just reading
Rachel's psych report

09:10.550 --> 09:11.919
from after her arrest.

09:11.952 --> 09:14.287
They called her
"confrontational."

09:14.321 --> 09:16.857
I guess if you're an aggressive
man, you're just a good sailor.

09:16.890 --> 09:19.159
But if you're a woman,
you're crazy and prone to snap.

09:19.192 --> 09:20.560
The Navy is making strides.

09:20.594 --> 09:23.030
But, yeah,
we still got a ways to go.

09:37.444 --> 09:39.713
This is Moore's house.

09:39.747 --> 09:41.749
It's a nice neighborhood.

09:41.782 --> 09:44.184
That's the Navy. Provides
everything a sailor needs.

09:44.217 --> 09:45.953
Well, not for Moore and Clarke.

09:45.986 --> 09:49.990
So the report said
Moore was killed in his bedroom.

09:52.425 --> 09:53.827
What about that house?

09:53.861 --> 09:56.363
They have a pretty good view
of Moore's place.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.532
Let's knock on a couple doors,
ask some questions.

10:02.703 --> 10:05.438
Let me handle this.

10:05.472 --> 10:07.007
Is there a problem,
Petty Officer?

10:07.040 --> 10:09.076
Sir, I'm placing you
under arrest for trespassing.

10:10.177 --> 10:11.879
I'm an officer with JAG.

10:11.912 --> 10:14.481
Sir, ma'am, please turn around.

10:14.514 --> 10:16.583
Like hell.
We're not trespassing.

10:16.616 --> 10:17.918
Ma'am, be quiet. Turn around.

10:17.951 --> 10:19.219
I will not ask you again.

10:19.252 --> 10:21.955
Relax. This is not our turf.

10:25.292 --> 10:27.172
Takes me back to my high school days.
Let's go.

10:34.167 --> 10:36.603
Each of you are in violation
of Chapter 18.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.405
U.S. Code 1382

10:38.438 --> 10:41.608
Trespass on a
military installation.

10:41.641 --> 10:44.511
You were permitted egress to
speak to Defendant Rachel Clarke

10:44.544 --> 10:47.047
at the prison facility
and access to DSO North.

10:47.080 --> 10:49.182
- That was all.
- It was all my fault, Admiral.

10:49.216 --> 10:50.459
And you will be disciplined,
Commander.

10:50.483 --> 10:51.885
Are you kidding me?

10:51.919 --> 10:53.320
We looked at a house.

10:53.353 --> 10:54.955
This is a military facility,
Ms. Scott.

10:54.988 --> 10:57.257
You don't look at a damn thing
unless I expressly say so.

10:57.290 --> 10:59.335
So, you're telling me we're not
allowed to reinvestigate?

10:59.359 --> 11:01.294
Because, based on this report,

11:01.328 --> 11:02.939
it looks like this case
was barely investigated

11:02.963 --> 11:04.664
- at all.
- Excuse me?

11:04.698 --> 11:06.066
- Madeline.
- Ms. Scott,

11:06.099 --> 11:07.600
as the commander of this base,

11:07.634 --> 11:09.602
I am the Convening Authority
of Courts-Martial.

11:09.636 --> 11:12.605
It is my duty to review
all investigations

11:12.639 --> 11:15.108
and to approve or disapprove
of any and all convictions.

11:15.142 --> 11:16.877
I did that in the Clarke case.

11:16.910 --> 11:18.611
Her case was open-and-shut.

11:18.645 --> 11:20.814
Never liked that phrase,
"open-and-shut."

11:20.848 --> 11:22.892
Always makes me feel
like someone's hiding something.

11:22.916 --> 11:25.152
Not that anyone did that
in Rachel Clarke's case,

11:25.185 --> 11:26.653
but based on this arrest

11:26.686 --> 11:28.121
and exchange
we're currently having,

11:28.155 --> 11:30.858
it seems no one is interested
in us reinvestigating.

11:30.891 --> 11:32.059
What are you talking about?

11:32.092 --> 11:34.094
The initial crime scene canvass
is incomplete.

11:34.127 --> 11:36.529
No one spoke to the sailor
who lived behind Moore.

11:36.563 --> 11:38.607
That's the first I've heard
of this. Who is this sailor?

11:38.631 --> 11:40.300
Admiral...

11:40.333 --> 11:42.669
you're the victim's
father-in-law.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.704
There's an obvious conflict
of interest here.

11:44.738 --> 11:46.573
I suggest you recuse yourself

11:46.606 --> 11:48.175
and let us do our job.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.546
Ms. Scott, Mr. Boudreau,

11:53.580 --> 11:55.048
if you follow the rules,

11:55.082 --> 11:56.750
you can investigate
anything you want.

11:56.784 --> 11:58.318
But understand this

11:58.351 --> 12:01.054
You are only welcome here
by my good graces.

12:01.088 --> 12:03.056
- Are we clear?
- Yes, sir.

12:04.491 --> 12:07.694
Crystal. Sir.

12:12.565 --> 12:15.002
I've slept with two other guys
since you, Bodie.

12:15.035 --> 12:16.837
What?

12:16.870 --> 12:18.671
Seriously?

12:21.041 --> 12:23.811
Who? No, you know what,
I don't even want to know.

12:23.844 --> 12:25.712
Was it that guy... the-the guy

12:25.745 --> 12:28.248
from homicide? The guy
with muscles on top of muscles?

12:28.281 --> 12:29.716
I don't think
I can take that guy.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.919
It was nobody.

12:33.420 --> 12:35.022
But...

12:35.055 --> 12:38.058
I like that you got all spun out
thinking it was.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.761
That is seriously cruel.

12:41.795 --> 12:43.931
You know what?
You're a terrible person

12:43.964 --> 12:46.566
who I want to have sex with
immediately.

12:46.599 --> 12:49.102
I've had enough of your jokes,
Bodie.

12:50.904 --> 12:52.239
No joking?

12:53.573 --> 12:55.408
I'm dead serious about you.

12:56.910 --> 12:58.745
I want to do this. I-I mean...

12:58.778 --> 13:00.580
I mean you and me.

13:00.613 --> 13:03.083
For real.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.555
Do you even know
what that means?

13:08.588 --> 13:10.123
Yeah.

13:11.158 --> 13:13.126
I think.

13:13.160 --> 13:16.096
Real means no games.

13:16.129 --> 13:19.933
No secrets, no manipulation.

13:19.967 --> 13:22.202
You can't ask me
for any more info.

13:22.235 --> 13:24.804
I'm either your source,
or I'm your...

13:26.806 --> 13:27.941
girlfriend.

13:27.975 --> 13:29.442
But I can't be both.

13:51.698 --> 13:53.967
All right, man.

13:54.001 --> 13:56.469
You got skills like my son.
What's your name... Ronaldo?

13:56.503 --> 13:58.438
My name is Cole, sir.

13:58.471 --> 14:00.573
- We're looking for your dad.
- Is he in trouble?

14:00.607 --> 14:01.808
No, not at all.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.443
We just want to talk to him.
Is he home?

14:03.476 --> 14:04.677
He's inside.

14:04.711 --> 14:06.713
My wife and I had just divorced.

14:06.746 --> 14:08.815
I was pulling double duty a lot
that year.

14:08.848 --> 14:10.783
It's possible

14:10.817 --> 14:13.020
that investigators came
by the house, but I wasn't home.

14:13.053 --> 14:16.990
But either way, I didn't see
or hear anything that night.

14:17.024 --> 14:18.258
Nothing at all?

14:18.291 --> 14:20.193
Not a thing.

14:21.528 --> 14:23.630
They found the gun
in Clarke's locker.

14:23.663 --> 14:25.098
She snapped.

14:25.132 --> 14:27.500
Couldn't take the heat.
It happens sometimes.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.202
We all know she did it.

14:29.236 --> 14:31.504
Now, if you'll excuse me,

14:31.538 --> 14:34.274
that's all I have to say
on the matter.

14:34.307 --> 14:36.209
Ensign Bennett
said Rachel snapped, too.

14:36.243 --> 14:37.710
And he barely knew her.

14:37.744 --> 14:39.755
Why does everyone keep giving us
the exact same answer?

14:39.779 --> 14:41.848
You're gonna get a lot of that.
Nobody wants to talk

14:41.881 --> 14:43.183
because the punishment
is severe.

14:43.216 --> 14:44.517
Bye, guys.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.886
Unless you're outside
the chain of command.

14:46.920 --> 14:48.555
Hey, Cole?

14:50.590 --> 14:53.793
Do you remember the night one
of your neighbors was killed?

14:53.826 --> 14:54.761
Yes, ma'am.

14:54.794 --> 14:56.063
Did you see anything?

14:58.031 --> 14:59.909
I-It's all right, hon.
You're not in any trouble.

14:59.933 --> 15:01.701
I promise.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.203
You can talk to us.

15:04.237 --> 15:06.739
I woke up 'cause I heard
a loud bang,

15:06.773 --> 15:08.341
like a gunshot.

15:08.375 --> 15:10.610
So I looked out the window.

15:10.643 --> 15:13.146
I saw someone come out
of the house.

15:13.180 --> 15:14.581
What did this person look like?

15:14.614 --> 15:16.183
He was tall.

15:16.216 --> 15:17.584
"He"?

15:19.219 --> 15:22.389
Are you sure that you saw a man,
not a woman?

15:22.422 --> 15:24.557
I'm sure. I even told my dad,

15:24.591 --> 15:26.002
but he said
I must've made a mistake.

15:26.026 --> 15:27.760
What the hell are you doing?

15:27.794 --> 15:30.063
How dare you speak to him
without my permission?

15:30.097 --> 15:31.398
Cole, get inside.

15:31.431 --> 15:32.966
Go get washed up for dinner.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.934
I'm sorry, sir,
you need to leave.

15:34.968 --> 15:37.070
Your son just told us
that he saw a man

15:37.104 --> 15:38.281
leaving Moore's house
that night.

15:38.305 --> 15:40.740
No, he didn't.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.976
Do not come back here.

15:44.978 --> 15:47.514
Looks like we have a witness.

15:52.619 --> 15:54.321
The prosecution argued

15:54.354 --> 15:57.124
that Seaman Clarke snapped and
killed Chief Petty Officer Moore

15:57.157 --> 16:00.293
in a fit of rage.
But an eyewitness saw a man...

16:01.961 --> 16:03.930
leaving Moore's house
the night of the murder.

16:03.963 --> 16:06.799
Where was this eyewitness at
Seaman Clarke's original trial?

16:06.833 --> 16:08.635
He was told not to testify
by his father.

16:08.668 --> 16:10.137
He was eight years old
at the time.

16:10.170 --> 16:12.272
So, not exactly reliable...

16:12.305 --> 16:13.940
You can't judge his veracity

16:13.973 --> 16:15.208
without meeting him.

16:15.242 --> 16:16.676
We're requesting a subpoena.

16:16.709 --> 16:18.411
Ms. Scott,
don't interrupt me again.

16:18.445 --> 16:19.822
That may work for you
in civilian court,

16:19.846 --> 16:21.214
but if you do it here,

16:21.248 --> 16:23.016
you'll find yourself
on the curb.

16:24.684 --> 16:26.453
Apologies, Your Honor.

16:26.486 --> 16:29.422
This court does not believe
an eight-year-old boy's account

16:29.456 --> 16:30.790
of the events of that night

16:30.823 --> 16:32.301
would have changed
the jury's verdict.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.961
How can you decide that without
even hearing his testimony?

16:34.994 --> 16:37.030
Ms. Scott,
the murder weapon was found

16:37.064 --> 16:38.831
in Seaman Clarke's wall locker.

16:38.865 --> 16:41.668
Everyone keeps saying that
as if that settles it.

16:43.436 --> 16:46.139
Apologies
for interrupting again.

16:46.173 --> 16:49.976
You are not suggesting
that Seaman Clarke was framed,

16:50.009 --> 16:52.845
- are you?
- That's exactly what we're arguing, Your Honor.

16:52.879 --> 16:54.681
Or we'd at least like
the opportunity

16:54.714 --> 16:56.549
to explore that in a new trial.

16:56.583 --> 17:00.053
Ms. Scott, Mr. Boudreau,

17:00.087 --> 17:02.122
we are not inclined to set aside

17:02.155 --> 17:04.090
the findings of this court
based on what

17:04.124 --> 17:05.858
you've brought us so far.
Bring us something

17:05.892 --> 17:07.993
more concrete beside
an eight-year-old witness,

17:08.027 --> 17:09.262
and we'll consider it.

17:09.296 --> 17:10.829
We'll give you three days.

17:10.863 --> 17:12.832
Three days? Your Honor...

17:12.865 --> 17:14.101
In that case, Your Honor,

17:14.134 --> 17:15.667
we'd ask you
to order prosecution

17:15.702 --> 17:17.470
to turn over
any discovery material

17:17.503 --> 17:20.473
they'd be obligated to give us
in the event of a new trial.

17:20.507 --> 17:23.443
The discovery
will be turned over forthwith.

17:23.476 --> 17:25.288
What is the difference
between a warrant officer

17:25.311 --> 17:26.646
and a petty officer?

17:26.679 --> 17:28.415
Is it-is it, like, personality?

17:28.448 --> 17:30.183
Guys, focus.

17:30.217 --> 17:31.718
We need to find
an alternate suspect,

17:31.751 --> 17:33.729
or our client will continue
to spend the rest of her days

17:33.753 --> 17:35.054
- in the brig.
- Okay.

17:35.088 --> 17:36.089
Found something.

17:36.123 --> 17:37.724
So, the Navy's theory
of the case

17:37.757 --> 17:40.026
was that Rachel had a knockdown
with Moore

17:40.059 --> 17:42.162
- just before she killed him, right?
- Correct.

17:42.195 --> 17:44.364
So, if Moore had
had a brutal fight with someone

17:44.397 --> 17:45.832
just days
before he was murdered,

17:45.865 --> 17:48.067
that person should also be ID'd
as a suspect.

17:48.101 --> 17:49.936
Yeah. Were they?

17:49.969 --> 17:53.506
Naval incident report,
25 September at 2200 hours.

17:53.540 --> 17:56.876
"Chief Petty Officer Moore
arrested after an altercation.

17:56.909 --> 17:58.511
"Treated for lacerations.

17:58.545 --> 18:00.880
Multiple sutures."
No charges followed.

18:00.913 --> 18:03.049
And that incident report
was not included in discovery

18:03.082 --> 18:05.918
at Clarke's original trial
even though it was requested.

18:05.952 --> 18:08.155
They buried it.

18:08.188 --> 18:09.589
Ooh, a naval cover-up.

18:09.622 --> 18:11.424
"I guess they just

18:11.458 --> 18:12.792
couldn't handle the truth."

18:12.825 --> 18:15.094
I've heard a lot of Jack
Nicholson impressions in my day.

18:15.128 --> 18:17.029
That was the worst one.

18:17.063 --> 18:19.666
This report may not prove
that Rachel's innocent,

18:19.699 --> 18:22.068
but it does prove
she was royally screwed over.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.870
So, we need to find out
who fought Moore,

18:23.903 --> 18:25.138
slap him with a subpoena,

18:25.172 --> 18:26.839
then we'll have
reasonable doubt.

18:28.074 --> 18:29.876
- Except...
- This file has been redacted.

18:29.909 --> 18:30.977
There it is.

18:31.010 --> 18:33.513
All mentions of the person
who fought Moore

18:33.546 --> 18:35.682
have been blacked out.

18:35.715 --> 18:38.185
Okay. Bodie and I will go talk
to Clarke's instructors.

18:38.218 --> 18:39.852
I'll get Tate. We'll go to court

18:39.886 --> 18:42.222
and petition to get
this report unredacted.

18:42.255 --> 18:45.392
The incident report,
illegally withheld from defense,

18:45.425 --> 18:46.969
indicates that
Chief Petty Officer Moore

18:46.993 --> 18:48.295
had a brutal fight with someone

18:48.328 --> 18:49.996
just days
before he was murdered.

18:50.029 --> 18:52.932
We demand that the court
grant our motion

18:52.965 --> 18:54.801
for an unredacted copy
of this report.

18:54.834 --> 18:57.737
Before you proceed any further,
Ms. Scott,

18:57.770 --> 19:01.107
has Commander Tate advised you
that the burden of proof

19:01.140 --> 19:02.309
lies with the defense?

19:02.342 --> 19:03.576
He has, Your Honor.

19:03.610 --> 19:05.745
Were you also aware
that the trial court

19:05.778 --> 19:09.216
ruled the report be suppressed
and redacted and therefore

19:09.249 --> 19:11.251
is not illegally withheld?

19:13.853 --> 19:16.489
That's not
in defense counsel's file.

19:16.523 --> 19:19.158
That's because the matter
was ex parte and sealed.

19:19.192 --> 19:21.728
Determined to have
no bearing on this case.

19:21.761 --> 19:23.129
May I ask why?

19:23.162 --> 19:25.665
If I told you that, Counselor,
it would defeat the purpose.

19:25.698 --> 19:28.768
You do know what
"classified" means, don't you?

19:28.801 --> 19:29.936
I do.

19:31.538 --> 19:33.940
- Let's go! Up the ropes! Move!
- Let's go!

19:33.973 --> 19:35.141
Up and over! I want ten!

19:35.174 --> 19:37.344
Knees up!

19:37.377 --> 19:39.346
Excuse me.

19:39.379 --> 19:41.748
Ezekiel Boudreau, Bodie Quick.

19:41.781 --> 19:43.216
Chief David Wyatt.

19:44.251 --> 19:45.952
We represent Rachel Clarke.

19:45.985 --> 19:47.587
We'd like to ask you
a few questions.

19:47.620 --> 19:49.622
Clarke?
Thought JAG locked her up.

19:49.656 --> 19:52.492
They did. We believe
she was wrongly convicted.

19:52.525 --> 19:54.427
From your cadet evaluation file,

19:54.461 --> 19:56.372
it seems you believe
Rachel didn't do it, either.

19:56.396 --> 19:58.298
Nothing but the truth.

19:58.331 --> 20:00.933
She was a squared away sailor.
Guts, determination.

20:00.967 --> 20:02.435
Solid attitude.

20:02.469 --> 20:04.003
Sounds like Arnold
from Commando.

20:04.036 --> 20:06.506
He was Army. And on steroids.

20:06.539 --> 20:08.675
So, why'd you change your mind
at her trial?

20:08.708 --> 20:10.148
Sounds like
you wanted her locked up.

20:10.176 --> 20:12.479
I did. Like I said,
nothing but the truth.

20:12.512 --> 20:14.113
She snapped, killed Moore.

20:14.146 --> 20:16.082
Just like that?

20:17.116 --> 20:19.185
Martin Anderson.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.454
These are
Rachel Clarke's lawyers.

20:21.488 --> 20:24.190
Chris Moore was my best friend.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.958
What Clarke did to him,

20:25.992 --> 20:27.627
she could have done
to any one of us.

20:27.660 --> 20:28.895
Why's that?

20:28.928 --> 20:30.663
As instructors,
we push these cadets

20:30.697 --> 20:31.998
to their breaking point.

20:32.031 --> 20:33.666
And then we push harder.

20:33.700 --> 20:35.902
Any specific reason Clarke
would snap and kill Moore?

20:35.935 --> 20:37.970
Maybe 'cause
she had a crush on him.

20:38.004 --> 20:39.472
And nothing happened.

20:39.506 --> 20:41.674
He was happily married,
had a kid.

20:41.708 --> 20:43.543
I think it all got to her head.

20:45.278 --> 20:46.855
She could've dropped out,
but she went psycho

20:46.879 --> 20:48.315
and she killed Chris instead.

20:48.348 --> 20:49.649
There is some doubt about that.

20:49.682 --> 20:50.883
Not for us.

20:57.023 --> 20:58.090
Keep your voice down.

20:58.124 --> 20:59.926
What, did you think
I wouldn't find out?

20:59.959 --> 21:01.528
I have customers.

21:01.561 --> 21:04.331
What's the matter, Linda?
Can't function without a fix?

21:04.364 --> 21:05.644
Hey, you got a problem, Heather?

21:08.401 --> 21:09.502
Did you follow me?

21:09.536 --> 21:10.737
It's all true, isn't it?

21:10.770 --> 21:12.171
The secret clique.

21:12.204 --> 21:13.806
I mean, why else
would you be mad that...

21:13.840 --> 21:15.107
that Linda's talking?

21:16.142 --> 21:18.511
You know, you were pretty cute

21:18.545 --> 21:20.179
in high school, Levi.

21:20.212 --> 21:22.715
Lots of us girls
had crushes on you.

21:22.749 --> 21:25.151
I mean, Linda here had
a huge crush on you.

21:25.184 --> 21:26.285
Didn't you, Linda?

21:26.319 --> 21:27.520
Shut up, Heather.

21:27.554 --> 21:30.122
But things got tougher
in college?

21:30.156 --> 21:32.425
You just kept coming back
and hanging out

21:32.459 --> 21:34.961
with all of us high schoolers
like a loser.

21:34.994 --> 21:37.196
How come?

21:37.229 --> 21:38.731
Yeah.

21:38.765 --> 21:41.300
Because you were obsessed
with Rosemary.

21:41.334 --> 21:43.269
It was so embarrassing.

21:43.302 --> 21:45.705
Rosemary and I used to laugh
about it.

21:45.738 --> 21:46.806
Back off.

21:46.839 --> 21:49.742
You used to laugh at him, too,
Linda. Remember?

21:49.776 --> 21:52.311
He was just a big joke.

21:52.345 --> 21:54.981
You're pathetic.

21:55.014 --> 21:57.116
That's why you killed Rosemary.

21:58.818 --> 22:00.587
Why don't you tell him
about Sparrow Ridge?

22:00.620 --> 22:02.154
Why don't you shut the hell up?

22:03.490 --> 22:05.210
Is that what you called
the clique, Heather?

22:06.292 --> 22:07.494
What's Sparrow Ridge?

22:07.527 --> 22:09.462
Must tie into what happened
to Rosemary.

22:09.496 --> 22:12.164
I mean, why else would you lie
on the stand

22:12.198 --> 22:13.918
and testify that my sister
and I killed her?

22:16.803 --> 22:19.739
What's Sparrow Ridge, Heather?

22:21.273 --> 22:24.176
Hi. Can I help you?

22:24.210 --> 22:25.578
I'm looking for Madeline Scott.

22:25.612 --> 22:27.313
Right this way.

22:27.346 --> 22:28.381
Elaine.

22:28.415 --> 22:30.950
Hello, Madeline. Commander Tate.

22:30.983 --> 22:32.284
We found what you're
looking for.

22:32.318 --> 22:34.454
You got us
the unredacted report.

22:34.487 --> 22:36.732
The congresswoman has pull
on the Armed Services Committee.

22:36.756 --> 22:38.858
You might need some of that

22:38.891 --> 22:40.493
when you see
who the redacted person is.

22:48.167 --> 22:50.102
I assumed that Moore
was duking it out

22:50.136 --> 22:51.538
with another drunken sailor.

22:51.571 --> 22:53.372
He was. Just so happens

22:53.406 --> 22:55.374
that drunken sailor
was an admiral.

22:55.408 --> 22:58.511
Well, now we know why
Dunlap was stonewalling us.

22:58.545 --> 22:59.979
So what's next?

23:00.012 --> 23:02.415
Grill the hell out of him.

23:07.687 --> 23:09.489
We read the
incident report about

23:09.522 --> 23:11.166
the vicious fight
between you and Chief Moore

23:11.190 --> 23:12.492
the week before his murder.

23:12.525 --> 23:13.960
That's classified.

23:13.993 --> 23:14.961
Not anymore.

23:14.994 --> 23:16.729
You two went at it pretty hard.

23:16.763 --> 23:18.865
Maybe Rachel Clarke
wasn't the one who snapped.

23:18.898 --> 23:20.242
- That's it. I've heard enough.
- Yeah, you must've been

23:20.266 --> 23:21.801
really furious with him.

23:21.834 --> 23:24.170
So, when Rachel and Moore
had that fight at the bar,

23:24.203 --> 23:27.006
you took advantage of the optics
and you framed Rachel.

23:31.444 --> 23:34.180
We need an answer, sir.

23:34.213 --> 23:36.282
Or my next phone call
will be to D.C.

23:49.128 --> 23:50.630
What's this?

23:50.663 --> 23:52.499
Copy of the letter
I wrote to SecDef,

23:52.532 --> 23:54.400
saying how honored I was
to potentially have

23:54.433 --> 23:56.903
the first female SEAL
under my command.

23:56.936 --> 23:58.270
Why would I frame her?

23:58.304 --> 24:01.273
As for my fight
with Chief Moore,

24:01.307 --> 24:04.110
it was about his relationship
with my daughter.

24:04.143 --> 24:06.879
He was drinking heavily
and they had just had a baby.

24:06.913 --> 24:08.648
I tried talking to him.

24:08.681 --> 24:12.084
But he got belligerent,
and it got ugly.

24:12.118 --> 24:14.554
I didn't want our private matter
to go public.

24:14.587 --> 24:17.056
It would have brought shame
to this base and to my family.

24:17.089 --> 24:18.591
That's why I had it redacted.

24:18.625 --> 24:20.226
Sorry to hear that, Admiral.

24:20.259 --> 24:21.861
Me too.

24:21.894 --> 24:23.863
But it doesn't mean
you didn't kill him.

24:25.397 --> 24:28.000
I was a fan of Seaman Clarke.
She had potential.

24:28.034 --> 24:31.237
But while she was using her
skills to murder my son-in-law,

24:31.270 --> 24:33.148
I was attending a banquet
with the Joint Chiefs.

24:33.172 --> 24:36.075
It's all on the record.

24:36.108 --> 24:38.277
So I-I hate to disappoint you,

24:38.310 --> 24:41.080
but I'm not your killer.

24:41.113 --> 24:43.616
The Pentagon confirmed
the admiral's alibi.

24:43.650 --> 24:45.051
So he didn't murder Moore.

24:45.084 --> 24:47.554
Rachel, the admiral said Moore's
marriage was in trouble.

24:47.587 --> 24:49.622
Your other instructor suggested

24:49.656 --> 24:51.734
there was a relationship brewing
between the two of you.

24:51.758 --> 24:53.769
I wasn't sleeping with him,
if that's what you're asking.

24:53.793 --> 24:55.227
He was my instructor.

24:55.261 --> 24:57.163
We're just trying to help you.

24:57.196 --> 24:59.932
If there's anything you want
to tell us, now's the time.

25:05.838 --> 25:08.240
I sit in this cell every day

25:08.274 --> 25:10.009
wondering how I got here.

25:10.042 --> 25:12.144
Who betrayed me and why?

25:12.178 --> 25:13.946
And is it because I'm a woman?

25:13.980 --> 25:16.916
And I feel so frustrated,
because I'm a fighter.

25:16.949 --> 25:19.518
And I can't fight back,
and I feel so...

25:19.552 --> 25:22.454
Powerless. I get it.

25:22.488 --> 25:24.624
Being in the Navy
is so much harder

25:24.657 --> 25:26.793
for a woman than for a man.

25:26.826 --> 25:29.762
The slightest infraction
is magnified.

25:29.796 --> 25:31.063
What happened?

25:33.199 --> 25:35.635
Moore and I were friends,
but that's all.

25:35.668 --> 25:37.303
We spoke a few times

25:37.336 --> 25:38.781
about things he didn't want
to tell his wife,

25:38.805 --> 25:40.239
but I didn't mention it
to anybody

25:40.272 --> 25:41.841
because fraternization
is frowned upon.

25:41.874 --> 25:43.309
And by fraternization

25:43.342 --> 25:45.477
- you mean...?
- Any personal relationship

25:45.511 --> 25:46.746
between officers and enlisted,

25:46.779 --> 25:49.548
including talking,
is prohibited.

25:49.582 --> 25:52.218
It would have destroyed
my chances at becoming a SEAL.

25:52.251 --> 25:54.520
Why didn't you bring this up
at your original trial?

25:54.553 --> 25:56.155
I didn't see the point.

25:56.188 --> 25:58.224
And then, after my trial
was over, it was too late.

25:58.257 --> 26:01.027
But... the truth is,

26:01.060 --> 26:04.897
Moore wasn't exactly
the most stable person.

26:04.931 --> 26:06.999
He told me
he was having nightmares.

26:09.568 --> 26:11.137
About what?

26:11.170 --> 26:14.006
He wouldn't say,
but this one time,

26:14.040 --> 26:16.508
I found him drunk in his office,
and he was really upset.

26:16.542 --> 26:19.612
And he kept ranting
about someone named Fahdi.

26:19.646 --> 26:21.047
Who's that?

26:21.080 --> 26:22.649
I don't know.

26:22.682 --> 26:24.727
But he kept on saying
that it shouldn't have happened

26:24.751 --> 26:27.854
and that he didn't deserve
to live.

26:27.887 --> 26:30.389
After that,
I just kept my distance.

26:33.459 --> 26:36.763
So Moore and Rachel
did have a relationship.

26:36.796 --> 26:38.731
Platonic,
but still more secrets.

26:38.765 --> 26:40.499
You know the question
we have to ask now.

26:40.532 --> 26:42.234
Who the hell is Fahdi?

26:43.602 --> 26:46.839
Margaret Atwood said,
"The best way to keep a secret

26:46.873 --> 26:49.575
is to pretend there isn't one."

26:49.608 --> 26:52.812
Sometimes secrets can have
dire consequences.

26:52.845 --> 26:54.781
The military, for example,

26:54.814 --> 26:57.784
uses secrets to protect
the chain of command.

26:57.817 --> 27:00.452
The fear is
if the truth is told,

27:00.486 --> 27:02.689
everything will fall apart.

27:02.722 --> 27:04.290
But what happens...

27:04.323 --> 27:06.659
if you're the weak link
in that chain?

27:06.693 --> 27:09.628
Who's there to protect you?

27:09.662 --> 27:11.130
I'm sorry.

27:11.163 --> 27:12.364
I didn't mean to interrupt.

27:12.398 --> 27:13.632
No, it's okay.

27:13.666 --> 27:15.167
You looked curious.

27:15.201 --> 27:16.645
Maddie says that what you do
for the firm here

27:16.669 --> 27:19.438
is really important.
Getting the word out.

27:19.471 --> 27:21.640
Telling the stories.

27:21.674 --> 27:23.409
So, what's your story?

27:23.442 --> 27:25.577
Sorry, I'm not one
of your sympathetic,

27:25.611 --> 27:27.613
wrongfully accused clients.

27:27.646 --> 27:29.581
I did the crime, I did the time.

27:29.615 --> 27:31.117
Which was...?

27:31.150 --> 27:32.852
Armed robbery of a liquor store.

27:32.885 --> 27:34.754
The clerk got hurt.

27:34.787 --> 27:36.823
I was just some young kid
on a joyride,

27:36.856 --> 27:39.158
and it cost me 20 years
of my life.

27:39.191 --> 27:42.528
Ten of those years
were with my best friend.

27:42.561 --> 27:44.096
You guys got close.

27:46.598 --> 27:48.467
How much of that story
do you know?

27:50.202 --> 27:53.372
Obviously not enough.

27:59.712 --> 28:01.547
Sorry to interrupt your trip.

28:01.580 --> 28:04.650
My conference finished early.

28:04.683 --> 28:07.787
And it sounded
like you wanted to talk.

28:07.820 --> 28:09.889
So, how's the campaign going?

28:09.922 --> 28:11.323
Good.

28:11.357 --> 28:13.225
The numbers are healthy.

28:13.259 --> 28:15.061
You better be careful, Gore.

28:15.094 --> 28:16.495
You may actually win this thing.

28:17.663 --> 28:19.531
So what can I do you for?

28:21.801 --> 28:23.970
I'm finally gonna do it,
Clifford.

28:24.003 --> 28:27.339
I'm gonna dredge
the quarry lake.

28:28.507 --> 28:31.210
You're still obsessed
with Madeline Scott.

28:31.243 --> 28:32.678
I'm obsessed with justice.

28:32.711 --> 28:35.614
Right.

28:37.016 --> 28:38.717
Well...

28:38.751 --> 28:41.253
this isn't my office anymore,
it's yours,

28:41.287 --> 28:43.722
so I'll just say what I said
to you way back then.

28:43.756 --> 28:46.826
It's a mistake, a boondoggle.

28:46.859 --> 28:48.928
It's different...
This time I know where to look.

28:48.961 --> 28:51.263
- Do you?
- A specific cove.

28:51.297 --> 28:53.332
Madeline's favorite place
at the quarry.

28:53.365 --> 28:55.902
If you do this,
it will come out.

28:55.935 --> 28:57.669
The media will be all over you

28:57.703 --> 28:59.405
for going after
that Scott girl again.

28:59.438 --> 29:00.940
I realize.

29:00.973 --> 29:03.442
And if you don't find anything,

29:03.475 --> 29:05.044
you'll be crucified.

29:05.077 --> 29:06.846
You can forget
about becoming A.G.

29:06.879 --> 29:09.415
It's a gamble. I know that.

29:09.448 --> 29:11.617
But you always told me
to trust my instincts.

29:11.650 --> 29:13.652
When it comes to the law,

29:13.685 --> 29:15.087
there is no one better than you.

29:15.121 --> 29:17.389
But Madeline Scott
is another matter.

29:17.423 --> 29:20.092
She's your great white whale,

29:20.126 --> 29:21.861
the one that got away,

29:21.894 --> 29:25.231
and the harder you hunt for her
the more desperate you seem.

29:25.264 --> 29:28.034
She's guilty, Clifford.

29:28.067 --> 29:30.837
To see her living in freedom

29:30.870 --> 29:34.373
and helping other people
escape justice...

29:35.774 --> 29:37.209
It's not right.

29:37.243 --> 29:39.411
Well, what do you want
from me, Gore...

29:39.445 --> 29:41.513
My blessing?

29:43.916 --> 29:46.618
I wish you well
in everything you do.

29:46.652 --> 29:48.320
I always will.

29:48.354 --> 29:50.522
But I'm no longer your boss,
and I'm not

29:50.556 --> 29:54.326
in a position to save you
from your mistakes anymore.

30:10.776 --> 30:12.644
Hey. Can we come in?

30:13.980 --> 30:15.982
Yeah, come on in.

30:20.987 --> 30:22.955
Who's your little friend?

30:22.989 --> 30:26.258
Bodie, meet Nathan.

30:26.292 --> 30:28.160
Nice to meet you.

30:28.194 --> 30:29.761
Nice to meet you, too, sir.

30:29.795 --> 30:32.064
Have a seat.

30:32.098 --> 30:34.066
Can I get you a dry martini

30:34.100 --> 30:37.236
or a orange juice
or chocolate milk?

30:37.269 --> 30:38.837
I'll take the chocolate milk.

30:41.040 --> 30:42.909
My God.

30:44.743 --> 30:47.279
I'm no doctor, but...

30:48.847 --> 30:51.283
he seems
a little old to be my son.

30:51.317 --> 30:52.718
Yeah, he's mine.

30:53.986 --> 30:55.854
Nathan's my nephew.

30:57.756 --> 31:00.859
My sister's been hooked
on opioids.

31:00.893 --> 31:03.038
So I've been fostering him
for her while she cleans up.

31:03.062 --> 31:04.931
Which will never happen.

31:04.964 --> 31:07.633
It's been, two years,

31:07.666 --> 31:10.202
um, headed towards permanent.

31:11.703 --> 31:14.706
It's why I've been afraid
to give this a real shot.

31:14.740 --> 31:16.943
This is me.

31:16.976 --> 31:18.945
Not hiding anything.

31:20.546 --> 31:22.548
You still want to do this?

31:28.287 --> 31:30.556
Yeah, sure, I mean...

31:31.958 --> 31:33.960
I really want to hide
these weapons

31:33.993 --> 31:36.062
before he kills himself, okay?
Can I just...?

31:36.095 --> 31:37.663
Hey, hey.

31:44.370 --> 31:46.905
Here's Moore's
deployment record.

31:46.939 --> 31:50.142
There's no mention of anyone
named Fahdi in Moore's jacket.

31:50.176 --> 31:53.479
What if Fahdi's not a person?

31:56.215 --> 31:58.050
Follow me.

31:59.952 --> 32:02.121
I'll cross-reference
all the incident reports

32:02.154 --> 32:04.790
on file for any mention of...

32:04.823 --> 32:06.392
There.

32:06.425 --> 32:09.028
A naval investigation
into a Taliban massacre

32:09.061 --> 32:12.064
at the Fahdi District
in Kabul Province.

32:12.098 --> 32:14.366
Fahdi District.

32:14.400 --> 32:15.968
Search the naval records,

32:16.002 --> 32:17.903
see which units were deployed
to that region.

32:20.772 --> 32:23.209
Chief Moore's SEAL team
was assigned to that A.O.

32:23.242 --> 32:24.719
We're gonna to need to talk
to the other members

32:24.743 --> 32:27.646
- of Moore's unit.
- One step ahead of you.

32:27.679 --> 32:29.881
Here's the unit's
deployment records.

32:35.587 --> 32:38.124
CPO Wyatt, you spoke
to my colleagues earlier

32:38.157 --> 32:40.126
and didn't mention that you,
Anderson, and Moore

32:40.159 --> 32:41.960
were in the same SEAL squad.

32:41.994 --> 32:43.229
So?

32:43.262 --> 32:45.164
So, what happened in Fahdi?

32:47.666 --> 32:50.602
I don't have
to tell you anything.

32:50.636 --> 32:52.904
You do, CPO Wyatt.
That's an order.

32:52.938 --> 32:54.473
It's a matter of public record.

32:54.506 --> 32:56.475
The Taliban murdered a family.

32:56.508 --> 32:58.944
Just another day in paradise.

32:58.977 --> 33:00.646
Rachel said that,
before his death,

33:00.679 --> 33:03.815
Moore was suffering from
something that seemed like PTSD.

33:03.849 --> 33:05.984
And it was getting worse.

33:06.018 --> 33:08.820
She said he kept saying,
"It shouldn't have happened."

33:08.854 --> 33:10.856
What was Moore talking about?

33:10.889 --> 33:13.759
What did he do?

33:13.792 --> 33:15.694
Look, there's a reason
you didn't mention

33:15.727 --> 33:17.829
that the three of you
were in the same squad.

33:17.863 --> 33:19.198
Why does it matter?

33:19.231 --> 33:21.867
I can't imagine the pressure
that you guys are under.

33:21.900 --> 33:23.001
I've never deployed.

33:23.035 --> 33:24.036
You're damn straight.

33:24.070 --> 33:25.704
But I do know what it feels like

33:25.737 --> 33:28.140
to spend every day
living in a place

33:28.174 --> 33:31.077
where even the air feels
like it's trying to kill you.

33:31.110 --> 33:33.612
That's enough
to make anyone snap.

33:33.645 --> 33:36.648
Rachel said that Moore
should talk to someone about it.

33:38.217 --> 33:40.319
Something terrible
happened at Fahdi,

33:40.352 --> 33:41.887
didn't it?

33:41.920 --> 33:43.655
Talk to us, Wyatt.

33:43.689 --> 33:46.658
I can help, but only
if you tell us what happened.

33:56.335 --> 33:58.704
Moore, Anderson, and I
were about to clear

33:58.737 --> 34:01.073
a known insurgent's house.

34:02.708 --> 34:05.877
Before we breached the door,
we...

34:05.911 --> 34:07.546
heard a loud bang.

34:07.579 --> 34:10.014
It sounded like gunfire,
so we returned.

34:11.949 --> 34:14.320
When we finally entered,
there were no guns.

34:14.353 --> 34:16.655
Just a...

34:16.688 --> 34:18.724
dead family.

34:18.757 --> 34:21.059
Women and children.
Shot to death.

34:23.829 --> 34:25.964
The loud bang must've been a...

34:25.996 --> 34:29.067
car backfire or something.

34:30.601 --> 34:32.304
Moore and I wanted
to report it to command,

34:32.338 --> 34:35.641
but Anderson insisted that
we would be court-martialed.

34:35.674 --> 34:36.842
It was a mistake.

34:38.076 --> 34:40.078
There was something else.

34:43.181 --> 34:46.083
An old man
was still in the house.

34:46.118 --> 34:48.554
He was alive.

34:50.255 --> 34:53.225
We could've saved him, I think.

34:53.259 --> 34:55.893
But Anderson shot him,

34:55.927 --> 34:57.329
killed him,

34:57.363 --> 35:00.098
just to make sure
there were no witnesses.

35:02.634 --> 35:05.103
Made a promise that day to never
speak about what happened.

35:05.137 --> 35:07.706
Moore was gonna talk to somebody
about what happened at Fahdi,

35:07.739 --> 35:09.617
and you and Anderson killed him
to keep him quiet.

35:09.641 --> 35:10.776
No, I...

35:10.809 --> 35:12.211
It was not me.

35:12.244 --> 35:15.581
M... Moore was like my brother.

35:17.115 --> 35:18.850
It had to have been Anderson

35:18.884 --> 35:20.452
who killed Moore, not Rachel.

35:20.486 --> 35:23.289
When everyone told me
she snapped, I believed it.

35:23.322 --> 35:25.191
I didn't know Moore
was gonna talk about Fahdi

35:25.224 --> 35:28.260
or that Anderson was planning
to do something about it.

35:28.294 --> 35:29.695
I would have stopped him.

35:29.728 --> 35:31.663
I didn't know.

35:34.600 --> 35:36.568
Say we believe you.

35:36.602 --> 35:38.970
You still need to make amends.

35:39.004 --> 35:42.073
You need to tell a judge
what happened.

35:43.942 --> 35:46.512
You can give Rachel Clarke
her life back.

35:52.851 --> 35:54.420
We heard a gunshot.

35:54.453 --> 35:55.797
We believed we were
being fired at.

35:55.821 --> 35:56.788
And you returned fire?

35:56.822 --> 35:58.089
Damn right.

35:58.123 --> 36:00.259
People die.

36:00.292 --> 36:03.762
Sometimes
those people are civilians.

36:03.795 --> 36:05.497
So, in the heat of battle,
bullets flying,

36:05.531 --> 36:07.233
everyone is fair game?

36:07.266 --> 36:08.200
I didn't say that.

36:08.234 --> 36:09.611
But if you have
to ask the question,

36:09.635 --> 36:11.102
you're gonna hate the answer.

36:11.136 --> 36:14.440
Yes. If it brings us one step
closer to ISIS or the Taliban.

36:14.473 --> 36:16.242
And after the shooting stops,

36:16.275 --> 36:18.477
when the situation is secure?

36:18.510 --> 36:20.679
It's never secure,
not over there.

36:20.712 --> 36:22.324
But you would agree
that the shooting death

36:22.348 --> 36:24.416
of an unarmed civilian after

36:24.450 --> 36:26.352
an engagement ends
is unacceptable?

36:26.385 --> 36:29.120
Without knowing the specifics,
I can't answer that question.

36:29.154 --> 36:30.989
How about these specifics

36:31.022 --> 36:34.159
An old man, wounded...
But not mortally...

36:34.192 --> 36:36.161
Lies on the floor in a house

36:36.194 --> 36:38.096
where the rest of his family
has died.

36:38.129 --> 36:40.266
But, thanks to you, that man,

36:40.299 --> 36:43.235
a witness to an unlawful kill,
is now dead.

36:48.173 --> 36:50.008
I don't know
what you're talking about.

36:50.041 --> 36:51.786
Chief Anderson, the only reason
that this hearing

36:51.810 --> 36:54.946
is even taking place
is that Chief Wyatt,

36:54.980 --> 36:56.648
who was in your squad,

36:56.682 --> 36:58.717
provided this court
with a statement.

36:58.750 --> 37:01.086
You shot an elderly man
in cold blood.

37:01.119 --> 37:02.721
And this is the gun

37:02.754 --> 37:06.692
that was used to kill
Chief Petty Officer Moore.

37:07.993 --> 37:10.629
Fancy. And untraceable.

37:10.662 --> 37:14.366
CPO Wyatt has confirmed that
you are the owner of this gun.

37:14.400 --> 37:18.570
Looks like you got it on your
last deployment, didn't you?

37:25.744 --> 37:28.046
I ask that this court
direct Chief Anderson

37:28.079 --> 37:30.048
to tell us how his weapon

37:30.081 --> 37:33.051
ended up in Seaman Clarke's
wall locker.

37:37.889 --> 37:39.758
What happened to you

37:39.791 --> 37:42.260
was a true injustice.

37:42.294 --> 37:44.262
On behalf of the U.S. Navy,

37:44.296 --> 37:46.698
it is my honor to reinstate you

37:46.732 --> 37:48.667
as Petty Officer Third Class.

37:52.871 --> 37:54.649
Now, let's see what I can do
about getting you readmitted

37:54.673 --> 37:55.874
to SEAL 101.

37:55.907 --> 37:57.443
Thank you, sir.

38:11.890 --> 38:13.959
Thank you

38:13.992 --> 38:16.227
for your service.

38:33.011 --> 38:35.981
You murdered Rosemary!

38:36.014 --> 38:37.282
You're lying, Madeline.

38:37.315 --> 38:39.485
I don't know
what you want me to say.

38:39.518 --> 38:40.619
How about starting

38:40.652 --> 38:42.721
with the truth?
No one believes you!

38:42.754 --> 38:44.423
Stop saying that!

38:44.456 --> 38:45.591
It's time to tell

38:45.624 --> 38:48.026
the truth.

38:54.299 --> 38:55.266
It's me.

38:55.300 --> 38:56.668
Do it.

38:56.702 --> 38:59.137
Dredge the lake.

39:05.777 --> 39:07.979
So, Wren...

39:09.781 --> 39:11.750
She's great, right?

39:11.783 --> 39:13.785
Smart.

39:17.956 --> 39:19.925
I know you, Maddie.

39:19.958 --> 39:23.729
I know she means more to you
than just a friend.

39:24.830 --> 39:26.965
Yeah.

39:26.998 --> 39:28.834
Okay.

39:30.636 --> 39:33.104
She's...

39:33.138 --> 39:34.372
Your girlfriend.

39:36.341 --> 39:37.809
I like her.

39:37.843 --> 39:39.220
Why didn't you ever tell me
about her?

39:39.244 --> 39:40.345
It's not like that. I...

39:40.378 --> 39:41.647
My best friend didn't tell me

39:41.680 --> 39:44.315
about a relationship
she's been in for over a decade.

39:44.349 --> 39:46.518
You're right. I shouldn't
take that personally.

39:55.494 --> 39:58.630
When it first started, it
just made things a lot easier.

39:58.664 --> 40:00.532
When I got out,

40:00.566 --> 40:04.035
it made things
really complicated.

40:04.069 --> 40:06.071
I still like guys.

40:07.072 --> 40:08.440
But I love Wren.

40:10.075 --> 40:11.943
And I don't know
what that means.

40:11.977 --> 40:13.812
I don't know if she's my person.

40:13.845 --> 40:15.113
If we split up,

40:15.146 --> 40:16.548
I don't know
if I would date men.

40:16.582 --> 40:18.550
Do I date women?

40:18.584 --> 40:20.385
Do I want to get married?

40:20.418 --> 40:22.053
I...

40:22.087 --> 40:23.722
I don't know.

40:23.755 --> 40:25.724
And I'm not ready
to answer questions about it.

40:25.757 --> 40:27.225
I'm just not.

40:27.258 --> 40:29.260
That's okay.

40:31.997 --> 40:35.133
It's Levi.

40:35.166 --> 40:37.402
Hey, Lev.

40:37.435 --> 40:38.970
Can you slow down?

40:39.004 --> 40:40.872
You're going where?

40:40.906 --> 40:42.007
Hold on.

40:42.040 --> 40:43.942
Don't go anywhere.
I-I'll be right there.

41:13.304 --> 41:15.273
How'd you find this place?

41:15.306 --> 41:18.276
Linda said they used
to meet outside of La Grange.

41:18.309 --> 41:20.111
Said something
about Sparrow Ridge,

41:20.145 --> 41:22.781
so I looked it up
on the Internet.

41:40.799 --> 41:42.133
You're better at this

41:42.167 --> 41:43.501
than I'm comfortable with.

41:47.105 --> 41:50.141
You do know breaking
and entering is a crime, right?

41:50.175 --> 41:52.343
Yeah, not when it's been
condemned for a decade.

41:52.377 --> 41:54.379
Well, even then.

42:00.218 --> 42:01.720
Hey.

42:01.753 --> 42:03.955
Check this out.

42:19.370 --> 42:21.206
- All right.
- After you.

42:23.842 --> 42:25.911
Careful.
There's stairs right there.

43:18.730 --> 43:21.066
Linda Barrett.

43:21.099 --> 43:23.769
Heather Dupinski.

43:23.802 --> 43:26.037
Rosemary Lynch.

44:07.645 --> 44:09.647
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH.

44:11.683 --> 44:13.728
You've seen the fight
for justice on Proven Innocent.

44:13.752 --> 44:16.121
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

44:18.690 --> 44:21.392
Rule number one
if you want to stay alive.

44:21.426 --> 44:23.294
Don't lie to your doctor.

44:26.497 --> 44:29.567
- Profits over patients, again.
- You save your morality lesson.

44:29.600 --> 44:30.936
You have to save him!

44:30.969 --> 44:33.004
Be careful.

44:33.038 --> 44:35.073
- You tried to kill him.
- I had no choice!

44:39.044 --> 44:40.445
Shall we?

44:43.314 --> 44:46.351
The Resident,
all new, Mondays at 800 on Fox.

44:49.955 --> 44:51.790
As they began
their hours of duty...

44:53.191 --> 44:55.994
it was a bell
that started it off.

44:57.162 --> 44:59.697
Each alarm was sounded
by a bell...

44:59.731 --> 45:02.467
that called them to place
their lives in jeopardy...

45:02.500 --> 45:05.570
for the good
of their fellow man.

45:05.603 --> 45:08.206
When the alarm had come
to an end,

45:08.239 --> 45:10.976
the bell rang,
to signal that end.

45:11.009 --> 45:13.378
9-1-1? What is your emergency?

45:13.411 --> 45:18.683
9-1-1. All new,
