00:02.001 --> 00:05.403
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family</i>
<i>who lost everything...</i>

00:05.505 --> 00:07.496
<i>and the one son</i>
<i>who had no choice...</i>

00:07.607 --> 00:09.598
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

00:15.115 --> 00:16.742
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

00:19.052 --> 00:21.282
<i>Michael was surprised to find the house...</i>

00:21.388 --> 00:23.856
<i>still a mess a week</i>
<i>after the fumigation.</i>

00:23.957 --> 00:28.690
You still haven't put this stuff back yet?
You've got to be the laziest person in the world.

00:28.795 --> 00:31.889
If you weren't all the way on the other side
of the room, I'd slap your face.

00:31.998 --> 00:35.434
- I asked you to clean this up.
- Yeah, and you also asked me
to call the fumigators...

00:35.535 --> 00:37.696
and you haven't even thanked me
for doing that.

00:37.804 --> 00:40.967
<i>Michael</i> had <i>asked her</i>
<i>to do this, but that was long before...</i>

00:41.074 --> 00:43.634
<i>he began hiding his fugitive father</i>
<i>in the attic.</i>

00:43.743 --> 00:47.611
What? Uh- Oh, God.

00:47.714 --> 00:50.706
Polly, cover your mouth!

00:50.817 --> 00:54.719
<i>Luckily, Michael was notified in time.</i>

00:54.821 --> 00:58.120
<i>Well, we had a deal, you know. I'd pay</i>
<i>for everything, and you'd clean the house.</i>

00:58.224 --> 01:01.057
- And you've only done it once.
- <i>She hadn't even done it that time...</i>

01:01.161 --> 01:04.289
<i>but instead, intercepted</i>
<i>her mother's housekeeper...</i>

01:04.397 --> 01:06.763
- <i>as she was arriving for work.</i>
- <i>Can I take you the rest of the way?</i>

01:06.866 --> 01:11.394
- <i>Mrs.</i>- <i>Mrs.</i>-
- Oh, I have to make one quick stop first.

01:11.504 --> 01:15.998
<i>Almost done. Yours or mister's?</i>

01:16.109 --> 01:18.134
Mister's.

01:18.244 --> 01:21.077
<i>Lupe never accepted a ride from Lindsay again.</i>

01:21.181 --> 01:25.140
<i>Well, I'm sorry, Michael,</i>
<i>but Tobias moving out hasn't been easy.</i>

01:25.251 --> 01:27.276
For any of us.

01:27.387 --> 01:29.617
You didn't even notice he'd gone,
did you?

01:29.722 --> 01:31.917
I did notice we'd stopped TiVoing
<i>The Christopher Lowell Show.</i>

01:32.025 --> 01:35.654
- What happened?
- <i>I tried to give it one last chance.</i>

01:35.762 --> 01:38.822
- Like what you see?
- <i>I've been looking for those.</i>

01:38.932 --> 01:41.594
- You're gonna stretch them out.
- That's all you can say?

01:41.701 --> 01:44.932
Well, excuse me for liking the way
they shape my junk.

01:45.038 --> 01:47.438
I don't know why, but that's it.

01:47.540 --> 01:51.340
You can pack your junk
and get out.

01:51.444 --> 01:54.004
You're kicking me out?
At the beginning of pilot season?

01:54.114 --> 01:58.483
You're not gonna make it as an actor,
and we're not gonna make it as a couple.

01:58.585 --> 02:01.611
<i>With nowhere to go,</i>
<i>Tobias went to the studio...</i>

02:01.721 --> 02:05.054
<i>where he'd occasionally worked</i>
<i>as a security guard and took up residence...</i>

02:05.158 --> 02:09.116
<i>in the apartment of Detective Frank Wrench,</i>
<i>on the set of the television show...</i>

02:09.229 --> 02:11.356
Wrench.

02:11.464 --> 02:14.490
<i>I'm really sorry to hear that.</i>
<i>How's Maeby taking it?</i>

02:14.601 --> 02:18.196
- Well, she's really hard to read.
- You haven't told her yet.

02:18.304 --> 02:20.864
Well, she was so excited the hot water
in the shower was lasting longer.

02:20.974 --> 02:23.807
How could I have the heart to tell her
it's because her father moved out?

02:23.910 --> 02:27.141
Tobias moved out?

02:27.247 --> 02:30.978
- Did he take the good video camera with him?
- <i>That's touching.</i>

02:31.084 --> 02:34.178
- What do you need the camera for?
- I'm making a magic video.

02:34.287 --> 02:36.915
I'm gonna tape myself
doing tricks around the office.

02:37.023 --> 02:41.255
I'm calling it <i>Tricks</i>-
Let me finish- <i>around the Office.</i>

02:41.361 --> 02:43.852
I figured out a way to
make money while I'm working.

02:43.963 --> 02:47.228
That <i>is</i> what we call working. Something
you might wanna try next time you're at the office.

02:47.333 --> 02:51.030
<i>You've been missing things lately.</i>
<i>I'm gettin'real tired of it.</i>

02:51.137 --> 02:53.731
<i>Incidentally, today we're having a big vote</i>
<i>on that building renovation.</i>

02:53.840 --> 02:56.673
- I need you there to help me vote it in.
- Fine. I'll vote...

02:56.776 --> 02:58.676
as long as
you give me the camera.

02:58.778 --> 03:01.611
I think we all know
that George Michael was using it last.

03:01.714 --> 03:05.810
<i>A fact the family had discovered</i>
<i>when they'd gathered to watch a home video.</i>

03:05.919 --> 03:09.252
Was that a 40th anniversary party, huh?
Didn't cost us a thing.

03:09.355 --> 03:12.290
Is that Qusay Hussein
at the omelet bar?

03:12.392 --> 03:15.452
Look at this. If these guys move,
they don't get paid.

03:17.197 --> 03:20.098
<i>It seems that as a 13-year-old,</i>
<i>George Michael had been...</i>

03:20.200 --> 03:22.862
<i>heavily influenced</i>
<i>by the</i> Star Wars <i>films...</i>

03:22.969 --> 03:26.461
<i>and had endeavored to</i>
<i>re-create his favorite moments.</i>

03:26.573 --> 03:29.736
- You're not my father! You'll never be!
- I spent $2.1 million...

03:29.842 --> 03:32.310
<i>of good company money</i>
<i>and end up with this?</i>

03:32.412 --> 03:34.710
<i>You cut off my hand!</i>
<i>Worth every penny.</i>

03:34.814 --> 03:38.306
Even you have to admit that
that was the lamest thing ever put on tape.

03:38.418 --> 03:41.683
<i>Not so. Buster</i>
<i>had once videotaped himself...</i>

03:41.788 --> 03:45.656
<i>re-creating moments from his</i>
<i>then favorite film,</i> Chicago.

03:45.758 --> 03:50.388
<i>He also liked</i> Star Wars.

03:52.332 --> 03:55.301
His self-esteem is low enough as it is,
and I have no idea why.

03:55.401 --> 03:58.564
<i>I mean, he's such a great kid, and</i>
<i>everybody loves him. He's George Michael!</i>

03:58.671 --> 04:03.768
<i>Truthfully, that's why I'm not that crazy</i>
<i>about that Ann, but he'll move on.</i>

04:03.876 --> 04:07.812
Unless he knocks her up like you did
with his mother. Plus, she's religious.

04:07.914 --> 04:10.906
If that one gets pregnant,
it stays pregnant.

04:11.017 --> 04:14.851
Believe me. I dated a chick like that
once in high school.

04:14.954 --> 04:17.081
No, I didn't.

04:17.190 --> 04:20.956
<i>I gotta work</i>
<i>on that boy's self-esteem.</i>

04:21.060 --> 04:24.325
<i>Michael went to do so,</i>
<i>only to hear Ann beating him to it.</i>

04:24.430 --> 04:26.489
- <i>I want you to do it.</i>
- <i>I don't think I'm ready.</i>

04:26.599 --> 04:28.863
- <i>Of course you are.</i>
- <i>I'm gonna lose it before I start.</i>

04:28.968 --> 04:31.300
Don't start!

04:31.404 --> 04:35.773
Smoking. It's a killer. That Sammy Davis Jr.
Should still be performing.

04:35.875 --> 04:38.867
- What's going on?
- Ann thinks I should run
for student body president.

04:38.978 --> 04:41.446
- That's a great idea.
- Well, I don't have a chance.

04:41.547 --> 04:44.482
- They only vote for the cool kids.
- But everyone loves you.

04:44.584 --> 04:46.848
You are George Michael!
Who's cooler than you?

04:49.255 --> 04:51.485
Plus, you would be following
in your old man's footsteps.

04:51.591 --> 04:53.684
- You were student body president?
- Oh-ho.

04:53.793 --> 04:56.125
- It was close.
- So you lost.

04:56.229 --> 04:57.992
- Who remembers?
- I know I would remember.

04:58.097 --> 05:00.156
Ann, if my dad says
that he won, then he won.

05:00.266 --> 05:02.700
<i>Didn't say I won.</i>
<i>Said I can't remember.</i>

05:02.802 --> 05:07.136
But now that we're thinking about it, I seem
to remember the other guy won the title...

05:07.240 --> 05:10.209
although there were plenty in the school
who wanted to overturn the decision.

05:10.310 --> 05:14.838
I said, "Let's- Do not- Let's not
put the school through that."

05:14.947 --> 05:17.415
Haven't thought about that for years.
Good memory.

05:17.517 --> 05:21.476
<i>Well, anyway, I'll help you run your campaign</i>
<i>and make your commercial for election day.</i>

05:21.587 --> 05:24.112
Well, that's great.
The important thing is...

05:24.223 --> 05:29.923
to raise the old self-esteem and not
to rush a physical relationship.

05:30.029 --> 05:33.362
- Those are really the two important things.
- <i>No. We're both waiting.</i>

05:33.466 --> 05:37.835
- Good.
- And then that first time,
after waiting and waiting-

05:37.937 --> 05:41.202
It's gonna be so awesome, because it's not
just gonna be my love and George Michael's...

05:41.307 --> 05:43.275
but God's love as well.

05:43.376 --> 05:47.005
- God, it's gonna be incredible.
- <i>All right. I'll do it. I'm in.</i>

05:47.113 --> 05:49.343
- Campaign?
- I'm pumped.

05:49.449 --> 05:52.543
<i>As George Michael was</i>
<i>on the path to higher self-esteem...</i>

05:52.652 --> 05:55.485
<i>Buster was losing</i>
<i>what little he had.</i>

05:55.588 --> 05:57.522
I can't put the aorta in
with this thing.

05:57.623 --> 06:00.490
<i>Oh, stop complaining.</i>

06:00.593 --> 06:04.859
- Buster!
- I'm sorry I'm an inconvenience to you, Mother.

06:04.964 --> 06:09.594
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh!

06:09.702 --> 06:12.865
<i>As Lupe felt sorry...</i>

06:12.972 --> 06:17.875
<i>for Buster's loss of a hand,</i>
<i>Lindsay felt sorry for her loss of Lupe.</i>

06:31.257 --> 06:34.954
<i>Lindsay had cleaned one room</i>
<i>and now had a garbage problem.</i>

06:35.061 --> 06:38.462
<i>And while looking for a spot to stash the refuse...</i>

06:38.564 --> 06:40.464
<i>She came upon an old friend.</i>

06:40.566 --> 06:44.161
I haven't seen this in ages. EBay.

06:44.270 --> 06:47.171
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>it was a new friend to George Sr.</i>

06:47.273 --> 06:50.299
Polly!

06:50.410 --> 06:55.040
<i>Back at the office, Michael came</i>
<i>to regret having given Gob the video camera.</i>

06:55.148 --> 06:57.309
Well, I certainly
appreciate your decision...

06:57.417 --> 07:00.079
but if my brother was here,
we could've voted this thing through.

07:00.186 --> 07:04.384
What's this?
A stuffy office meeting?

07:04.490 --> 07:08.984
Well, maybe it's time
for a little... <i>Office Magic.</i>

07:09.095 --> 07:14.431
- What's "office magic"?
<i>- Sometimes it's as simple as turning 10:45...</i>

07:14.534 --> 07:18.470
in the morning into lunchtime!

07:18.571 --> 07:21.836
- Okay.
- Why does lunch have to be so dull?

07:21.941 --> 07:26.139
Maybe you'd
prefer some chicken instead!

07:26.245 --> 07:29.806
All right. Let's cut.
Take five, everybody.

07:29.916 --> 07:33.147
- No, no. We're not takin' five.
Hey, is this guy with you?
- Yeah, he's an actor.

07:33.252 --> 07:36.278
Well, you know, I thought
he was an investor. He voted against me...

07:36.389 --> 07:38.949
which is the vote I asked you
to be here for, so-

07:39.058 --> 07:42.858
You know what? I don't know why, but that's it.
I don't think I can work with you anymore.

07:42.962 --> 07:45.453
- You kind of have to, guy. I'm the president.
- No. I'm the president.

07:45.565 --> 07:49.399
No. You lost the presidency, just like you did
in high school when you refused to play dirty.

07:49.502 --> 07:51.970
- Worked when I ran.
- We're talkin' about the office here, okay?

07:52.071 --> 07:54.062
I do all the work. I've been helping you.
That's over now.

07:54.173 --> 07:58.007
Sorry to hear you say that, Michael,
'cause it just cost you your job.

07:58.110 --> 08:00.874
- I'm serious. It's over.
- How do you call Security on this thing?

08:00.980 --> 08:04.040
- You hit pound-zero-zero to operate the system.
- Pound is tic-tac-toe, right?

08:04.150 --> 08:06.846
- Yeah. Pound is right-
- When I keep hitting that, the other thing flashes.

08:06.953 --> 08:09.387
- Hit pound and then zero-zero.
- I do. I know.

08:09.489 --> 08:12.390
Tell you what. You don't need to learn
the system, because you're out of here.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.983
You're fired.

08:15.094 --> 08:16.994
Have Security send a man up.

08:17.096 --> 08:19.496
You've got the wrong guy.

08:19.599 --> 08:22.591
<i>Uh, no, you don't,</i>
<i>but you don't have to do this.</i>

08:22.702 --> 08:26.433
<i>But the guard had recently</i>
<i>lost halfhis tie to</i> Office Magic.

08:26.539 --> 08:29.406
- Oh, I don't mind.
- Get this. You getting this?

08:29.509 --> 08:32.409
Cheat out.
You have to cheat out a little bit.

08:32.511 --> 08:35.174
- Oh, hey.
- What was that all about?

08:35.280 --> 08:38.114
Your uncle doesn't
not-work here anymore.

08:38.217 --> 08:42.517
- So I guess your mom told you
about your dad moving out, huh?
- No, she did not tell me that.

08:42.621 --> 08:44.852
- Oh.
- But she doesn't tell me anything.

08:44.957 --> 08:48.017
- Neither of them do.
- Sorry. Guess I shouldn't have said anything.

08:48.127 --> 08:51.290
Maybe I should just start
keeping some secrets of my own.

08:51.397 --> 08:53.456
Why aren't you at school right now?

08:53.566 --> 08:56.057
Marry me.

08:56.168 --> 08:59.069
I'm so sorry.
I forgot who I was talking to.

08:59.171 --> 09:02.766
I was just using your copier
to make some campaign posters.

09:02.875 --> 09:05.639
Well, then, by all means,
let me help you out.

09:05.745 --> 09:08.543
I mean, I don't even know why I'm doing it.
He's gonna win by a landslide.

09:08.648 --> 09:11.139
- That's what I was tellin' him.
- How do you know Steve Holt?

09:11.250 --> 09:13.650
- Are you in A.A.?
- I was talkin' about George Michael.

09:13.753 --> 09:15.983
He's running for student body president.
Who's Steve Holt?

09:16.088 --> 09:19.057
He's just the hottest guy in school.
And he's won three years in a row-

09:19.158 --> 09:21.058
every year after his first junior year.

09:21.160 --> 09:23.390
So, then, he's more popular
than George Michael?

09:23.496 --> 09:27.899
Well, that's like comparing apples
and some fruit nobody's ever heard of.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.491
He might even finish
after the Indian kid.

09:30.603 --> 09:34.039
I guess I gotta get down to the school
and see if I can stop him from signing up, huh?

09:34.140 --> 09:38.008
Yes. You have to. And do you think you could
put up a couple of these when you're there...

09:38.110 --> 09:41.170
'cause I was really not
in the mood to go down there.

09:41.280 --> 09:45.080
<i>Michael went to take care ofhis son...</i>

09:45.184 --> 09:48.915
<i>as Lucille discovered that hers</i>
<i>was already being taken care of.</i>

09:49.021 --> 09:54.049
Mother!
- And yet you're too good
to polish the candlesticks?

09:54.160 --> 09:56.754
- You're fired!
- You can't fire me. I'm your son.

09:56.862 --> 09:59.660
- I'm firing you!
- I was firing Lupe!

09:59.765 --> 10:01.494
Well, that makes more sense.

10:05.137 --> 10:07.867
- <i>Lindsay came upon Lupe, who'djust been fired.</i>
- I no clean for family anymore.

10:07.974 --> 10:11.705
Can't you at least
come over and DustBuster or something?

10:11.811 --> 10:15.338
- I no does Buster anymore.
- Fine.

10:15.448 --> 10:19.441
I'll DustBuster! God.

10:19.552 --> 10:21.782
- Hello?
- Hey. I can't talk loudly.

10:21.887 --> 10:24.788
I'm in the bathroom of the <i>Wrench</i> set,
and they've started shooting.

10:24.890 --> 10:29.020
Also, I don't think this is a real toilet.

10:29.128 --> 10:32.996
So I just wanted to check on Maeby
and tell you that I haven't landed a part yet...

10:33.099 --> 10:36.830
but despite what you may think,
my talent shall win out.

10:36.936 --> 10:40.736
Well, Maeby's fine. We've been looking
for a cleaning lady, so if you hear of one-

10:40.840 --> 10:43.570
Shh- Shh.
- <i>... dirty cop,</i>
<i>so Frank Wrench is gonna clean ya.</i>

10:43.676 --> 10:46.611
<i>- Why is this door locked?</i>
<i>- Cut!</i>

10:46.712 --> 10:49.806
- <i>Is somebody using the set bathroom?</i>
- I gotta go.

10:49.915 --> 10:53.715
<i>Michael arrived at school</i>
<i>to talk his son out of running for office.</i>

10:53.819 --> 10:56.845
It took me all day, but I got the 10 signatures.
I'm running for student body president.

10:56.956 --> 11:02.519
- Listen, George Michael-
- <i>We're gonna use your idea</i>
<i>and highlight being chaste.</i>

11:02.628 --> 11:05.927
I just meant you two shouldn't-
You're not gonna put up this poster, are you?

11:07.533 --> 11:09.626
It's really gonna appeal
to the Christian crowd.

11:09.735 --> 11:12.431
I couldn't have done this without you guys.
I'm gonna win this thing.

11:12.538 --> 11:16.998
Four more years! Four more years!

11:17.109 --> 11:19.577
Four more years!
Four more years!

11:19.679 --> 11:22.580
<i>And Gob showed up at his mother's.</i>

11:22.682 --> 11:25.845
- Well, guess who's been fired.
- Michael fired you?

11:25.951 --> 11:29.682
No. I fired him. As a result,
I'm no longer welcome in the office.

11:29.789 --> 11:32.758
What a coincidence.
I just fired my housekeeper...

11:32.858 --> 11:35.258
but I've already found a replacement.

11:35.361 --> 11:38.125
It's a robot.

11:38.230 --> 11:42.599
- I hate it. I miss Lupe.
- No. I won't let you go down that road.

11:42.702 --> 11:45.796
I want you to be strong, and you don't
need the comfort of an immigrant...

11:45.905 --> 11:48.567
in Mother's old stirrup pants
to make you feel that way.

11:49.642 --> 11:51.542
Oh.

11:51.644 --> 11:55.136
Ohh, you're hungry.

11:55.247 --> 11:58.910
<i>Lindsay was about</i>
<i>to find a replacement for Lupe as well.</i>
- Who is it?

11:59.018 --> 12:02.146
The new housekeeper. The agency sent me over.

12:02.254 --> 12:04.313
I'm sorry. I didn't call any-

12:04.423 --> 12:09.656
Oh, allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Phyllidia Featherbottom...

12:09.762 --> 12:14.665
and I can cook and I can clean
and I can take care of the little ones.

12:14.767 --> 12:19.568
I can also sing a song or two,
if it comes in handy.

12:19.672 --> 12:24.041
When you put a squirt
of frosting on your throat

12:24.143 --> 12:26.111
Before we take
our medications

12:26.212 --> 12:30.808
<i>Tobias had gained access to</i>
<i>the studio's wardrobe and makeup department.</i>

12:30.916 --> 12:33.214
<i>He was eager</i>
<i>to both see his daughter...</i>

12:33.319 --> 12:37.255
<i>and prove to his wife</i>
<i>that he had what it took to be an actor.</i>

12:37.356 --> 12:42.157
- <i>It was the exact plot of the film</i> Mrs. Doubtfire.
- In the most delicious way

12:42.261 --> 12:46.425
<i>There was also</i>
<i>some Mary Poppins in there.</i>
- Let's get this house cleaned.

12:46.532 --> 12:49.695
Hey. Lindsay,
the place looks fantastic.

12:49.802 --> 12:54.796
- What? Did you pay somebody to do this?
- Oh, I've no need for payment.

12:54.907 --> 12:57.535
The love of the family
is more than enough.

12:57.643 --> 13:00.669
I'm sorry.
This is Mrs. Featherbottom.

13:00.780 --> 13:03.613
From Blackstone.
I'm charmed, I'm sure.

13:03.716 --> 13:07.015
Ooh!

13:07.119 --> 13:09.485
Back to work.

13:09.588 --> 13:12.216
- I think he misses his daughter.
- That's convenient...

13:12.324 --> 13:15.555
considering you didn't even have the courage
to tell Maeby that he'd moved out.

13:15.661 --> 13:18.129
I'm sorry.
I'm not the perfect parent, like you.

13:18.230 --> 13:21.393
I'm not that perfect. I pushed George Michael
into running for office...

13:21.500 --> 13:24.401
and I think he's gonna
get crushed by this kid Steve Holt.

13:24.503 --> 13:27.904
<i>Yeah. I'd vote for Steve.</i>
<i>Too bad Dad's on the lam.</i>

13:28.007 --> 13:32.706
You could finally use some of his dirty tricks
to get George Michael elected.

13:32.812 --> 13:35.212
<i>As it happens,</i>
George Sr. Had come to...

13:35.314 --> 13:39.011
<i>in the attic, and perhaps it was the effect</i>
<i>oflosing his one friend</i>-

13:39.118 --> 13:42.144
- Polly?
- <i>or the lingering effects of the fumigation</i>-

13:42.254 --> 13:45.087
<i>or perhaps it really was</i>
<i>divine intervention</i>-

13:45.191 --> 13:48.991
<i>but he'd had a profound realization.</i>

13:52.164 --> 13:55.725
<i>Unfortunately, the timing</i>
<i>of the enlightenment wasn't ideal for Michael.</i>

13:55.835 --> 13:59.896
- That's why I need your help.
- "Our Heavenly Father let his son die...

14:00.005 --> 14:02.405
so that our sins
could be absolved."

14:02.508 --> 14:06.569
- Great. So you're a Christian now.
- "We must all seek forgiveness."

14:06.679 --> 14:09.170
Well, I'll call the warden for you.
You can ask him yourself.

14:09.281 --> 14:14.742
Well, I think that's for fresh crimes.
Besides, you've always tried to lead a clean life.

14:14.854 --> 14:20.190
You and Gob were like
those biblical brothers, Gallant and, um-

14:20.292 --> 14:22.283
"Goofuth."

14:22.394 --> 14:25.625
<i>Michael realized he</i> had <i>lived like Gallant...</i>

14:25.731 --> 14:28.291
<i>and ifhe wanted</i>
<i>to help his son's election...</i>

14:28.400 --> 14:30.527
<i>he would have to find...</i>
<i>Goofuth.</i>

14:30.636 --> 14:33.230
- Been lookin' all over for you, pal.
- If you came to grovel...

14:33.339 --> 14:35.307
for the job of president,
you're too late.

14:35.407 --> 14:40.401
- My brother already fired me.
- Listen, I'm really sorry that I got upset with you...

14:40.512 --> 14:43.916
you know, and I never meant to, um-
I didn't even mean to fire you.

14:43.916 --> 14:45.941
You know, and I never meant to, um-
I didn't even mean to fire you.

14:46.051 --> 14:50.420
You know? I just got so frustrated,
and, Gob, you are my brother.

14:50.522 --> 14:54.253
- Of course I'm gonna support you.
- Well...

14:54.360 --> 14:56.419
now I feel bad for firing you.

14:56.528 --> 14:59.964
Listen, George Michael is running
for student body president...

15:00.065 --> 15:01.965
and I have a feeling
he's gonna get slaughtered.

15:02.067 --> 15:05.002
The guy he's running against
is basically a young you.

15:05.104 --> 15:10.406
Wow. It won't be easy
to win a race against myself.

15:10.509 --> 15:13.342
- Of course, if anyone can do it, I can.
- That's right.

15:13.445 --> 15:16.937
- I wish I was 15 years younger.
- He doesn't need to beat him.

15:17.049 --> 15:20.507
- He just needs to beat the Indian kid.
- If I do this, you'll rehire me?

15:20.619 --> 15:23.383
- Of course I will.
- The mere fact that you think you can...

15:23.489 --> 15:26.617
says to me
that I shouldn't let you.

15:26.725 --> 15:30.923
Course,
we both need the work.

15:31.030 --> 15:32.998
Robot'll get it.

15:33.098 --> 15:35.692
Where the hell is my maid?
Robot!

15:35.801 --> 15:39.259
<i>But the robot was busy elsewhere.</i>

15:42.408 --> 15:46.003
What do you expect, Mother? I'm half machine!

15:47.479 --> 15:50.073
I'm a monster!

15:58.557 --> 16:01.651
<i>Michael brought Gob in</i>
<i>to consult on his son's campaign.</i>

16:01.760 --> 16:04.991
Focus on the video and shy away
from the virgin thing.

16:05.097 --> 16:07.964
Oh, we should definitely
sacrifice the whole virgin thing.

16:08.067 --> 16:10.058
<i>And I got the perfect way.</i>

16:10.169 --> 16:14.299
We hand out rubbers that say,
"We salute George Michael."

16:14.406 --> 16:17.500
- We're not supposed to have help.
- I don't wanna make Steve look bad.

16:17.609 --> 16:20.669
Yeah, I just don't want my son to be
embarrassed up there. Let's not play too dirty.

16:20.779 --> 16:24.579
- Uh, good point, two percent.
- Two percent, huh? Is that how little I lost by?

16:24.683 --> 16:26.651
- Lost by? That's all you got.
- Not really important.

16:26.752 --> 16:30.654
<i>Well, if your son wants more than two percent,</i>
<i>he's gonna have to go after Steve Holt.</i>

16:30.756 --> 16:34.487
<i>So I want you to tell me every awful rumor</i>
<i>you've ever heard about this kid.</i>

16:34.593 --> 16:37.027
I can't support this,
and neither can the Christian kids...

16:37.129 --> 16:39.825
- that were gonna make you president.
- Uh-

16:39.932 --> 16:42.833
<i>Ann? I think</i>
<i>she's really upset about this.</i>

16:42.935 --> 16:46.268
She'll forgive ya.
You're George Michael.

16:46.372 --> 16:49.273
<i>Meanwhile...</i>

16:49.375 --> 16:51.343
<i>Maeby was meeting</i>
<i>her new singing nanny.</i>

16:51.443 --> 16:54.207
Now. Take your Fun-fun.

16:54.313 --> 16:58.682
This is my mom's, and it's fen-phen,
and it's been banned by the F.D.A.

16:58.784 --> 17:03.278
Oh! Well.
You should always read the label

17:03.389 --> 17:06.915
<i>You should always read it well</i>
<i>in the most delicious way</i>

17:07.026 --> 17:09.085
- Mr. Fingerbottom?
- Mrs.

17:09.194 --> 17:11.424
<i>Right. Mrs.</i>
<i>I should really get going.</i>

17:11.530 --> 17:15.125
No, no, no, no, no.
Sit back. What's the rush? Please.

17:15.233 --> 17:17.964
I wanna hear about you.
Tell me about your family.

17:18.069 --> 17:22.632
I'm sure wherever your father is right now,
she loves you very, very much.

17:22.741 --> 17:25.767
Not enough to be honest
with me.

17:28.380 --> 17:30.746
<i>And after a few days, Gob was ready...</i>

17:30.849 --> 17:33.079
<i>to unveil</i>
<i>George Michael's new message.</i>

17:33.185 --> 17:35.983
<i>Drought, starvation</i>-

17:36.088 --> 17:40.286
These are the things my family
has had to deal with for generations...

17:40.392 --> 17:43.327
although, fortunately,
not since we moved to Corona del Mar.

17:43.429 --> 17:47.126
<i>Go home, you terrorist!</i>

17:47.232 --> 17:49.962
How stupid do you have to be
to say something like that?

17:50.069 --> 17:53.470
- You're not wanted here!
- Gob.

17:53.572 --> 17:56.439
- Michael.
- You got George Michael's tape?

17:56.542 --> 18:00.444
Yeah. I gave it to the tech guy.
Don't worry. It's very tastefully done.

18:00.546 --> 18:03.447
Sure you didn't make that video in a cave?

18:03.549 --> 18:06.279
<i>- Perennial candidate Steve Holt!</i>
<i>- Soon it was time...</i>

18:06.385 --> 18:08.444
<i>for Steve Holt to play his video...</i>

18:08.554 --> 18:11.819
<i>which had been produced</i>
<i>by his new campaign manager, Ann Veal.</i>

18:11.924 --> 18:16.156
- Hi. I'm Steve Holt.
<i>- Evil!</i>

18:16.261 --> 18:19.492
This kid's popular?

18:19.598 --> 18:22.123
Looks like a chick I did
once in high school.

18:22.234 --> 18:24.293
Get a haircut!

18:24.403 --> 18:27.429
Recently, I've been dealing with the fact
that I've never known my father...

18:27.539 --> 18:31.134
<i>but I finally found a new Father.</i>

18:31.243 --> 18:34.110
You're probably wondering
what these footsteps are.

18:34.213 --> 18:39.515
Well, this is my second take. It's kind of
like a second chance at making good.

18:42.287 --> 18:45.518
<i>Yeah. Okay. We need</i>
<i>to pull the videotape.</i>

18:45.624 --> 18:47.990
- My tape?
- Why?
- I've made a huge mistake.

18:48.093 --> 18:52.029
<i>But it was too late</i>
<i>to do anything about it.</i>

18:52.131 --> 18:56.500
Steve Holt is a bastard.
He doesn't even know who his real father is.

18:56.602 --> 19:01.335
What else don't we know
about Steve Holt?

19:01.440 --> 19:04.705
George Michael Bluth
is a cool guy.

19:04.810 --> 19:08.075
His dad is a powerful executive
working for this man.

19:08.180 --> 19:12.082
The girls like him just fine.
Young and old. It doesn't matter.

19:12.184 --> 19:15.244
- In the dark.
- That's why you had me do that?

19:15.354 --> 19:18.585
<i>George Michael</i>
<i>had never been more embarrassed.</i>

19:18.690 --> 19:21.352
<i>Until this part.</i>

19:21.460 --> 19:23.519
I couldn't find another tape.

19:29.801 --> 19:32.827
I like Steve's more.

19:32.938 --> 19:35.998
Guess I underestimated
the religious vote.

19:36.108 --> 19:39.271
- So Steve won?
- No. Steve dropped out of the race.

19:39.378 --> 19:41.938
He says he wants to spend some time
trying to find his real father.

19:42.047 --> 19:45.346
Rav Nadir, the Indian kid,
he got 97% of the vote.

19:45.450 --> 19:50.046
Well, that leaves three percent.
You did better than I did when I ran.

19:50.155 --> 19:52.851
I tied with Bart Simpson
and "School Sucks."

19:52.958 --> 19:54.983
I'm really sorry, buddy.
Believe it or not, I did this...

19:55.093 --> 19:57.425
because I didn't want you
to feel bad about yourself.

19:57.529 --> 20:00.259
Hey, it's Star Dork.

20:00.365 --> 20:03.391
Hey, he knows you now.
I'm really sorry, buddy.

20:03.502 --> 20:07.438
It's just a drag. I mean, I'm pretty sure
my girlfriend's gone forever...

20:07.539 --> 20:09.564
and I never wanted
to do this in the first place.

20:09.675 --> 20:15.079
George Michael, was that really you
doing those lightsaber moves?

20:15.180 --> 20:18.377
- You were incredible.
- I've only gotten better.

20:18.483 --> 20:21.077
You're still doin' that?

20:21.186 --> 20:25.953
<i>So, you wanna grab a curtain rod</i>
<i>and go over to my place?</i>

20:26.058 --> 20:29.118
Wow. I'd love that.
Thanks, Ann.

20:29.228 --> 20:32.322
You really make me
feel good about myself.

20:35.067 --> 20:39.299
Gotta do something
about that kid's self-esteem.

20:39.404 --> 20:41.838
<i>On the next</i> Arrested Development.

20:44.042 --> 20:46.738
