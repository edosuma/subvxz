00:30.614 --> 00:34.351
We have
been hiding among you for generations.

00:34.384 --> 00:35.987
We are everywhere.

00:36.020 --> 00:38.823
We bag your groceries,
we teach your children,

00:38.856 --> 00:41.725
we fight your wars,

00:41.759 --> 00:45.029
always beneath your notice,
always searching.

00:46.798 --> 00:49.867
Tonight, we finally claim
what's rightfully ours,

00:49.901 --> 00:54.671
power, unholy and unspeakable.

00:54.704 --> 00:56.640
Power that had been hidden
from us

00:56.673 --> 00:59.409
beneath a house of lies,

00:59.442 --> 01:04.346
power to remake this weak world
in our image,

01:04.381 --> 01:09.452
power to cheat death
and live forever in darkness.

01:09.486 --> 01:11.956
We are the divide.

01:11.989 --> 01:14.391
We carry on.

01:17.795 --> 01:18.896
Feels like I'm
back in high school

01:18.930 --> 01:20.865
with you driving me around.

01:20.898 --> 01:22.800
Josie,
I still drive you around everywhere.

01:22.834 --> 01:26.369
No,
sometimes the Castillos pick me up.

01:26.403 --> 01:28.005
Just don't call
me five minutes after I leave

01:28.039 --> 01:30.373
asking me to come back
and get you.

01:30.407 --> 01:31.541
That only happened twice.

01:31.575 --> 01:33.510
Because you
only went to a party twice.

01:34.812 --> 01:36.379
Are you sure
I'm still goin' the right way?

01:36.413 --> 01:38.448
Yeah, this is right.

01:38.481 --> 01:40.517
The house is
really high up here.

01:40.550 --> 01:41.819
I love it.

01:41.853 --> 01:42.820
Don't you ever get scared?

01:42.854 --> 01:43.955
I know I'd be.

01:43.988 --> 01:45.122
Nah.

01:45.156 --> 01:45.990
It's so hard to find this place,

01:46.023 --> 01:48.125
I don't think it's even
on any map.

01:48.159 --> 01:50.460
It's not on my GPS.

01:50.493 --> 01:52.529
Is their daughter
in your Mustard Seed's troop?

01:52.562 --> 01:54.397
Not yet, next year.

01:55.699 --> 01:58.735
Oh, you're still going
to be a troop leader next year?

01:59.502 --> 02:00.805
Yeah, why wouldn't I?

02:00.838 --> 02:02.639
Honey, you're
surrounded by a bunch of 10-year-olds

02:02.672 --> 02:03.473
when you're there.

02:04.474 --> 02:05.575
Thanks, mom.

02:05.609 --> 02:06.844
I don't mean to be
harsh, but I just...

02:06.878 --> 02:08.211
What?

02:08.246 --> 02:09.847
Weren't you invited
to some Christmas party tonight?

02:09.881 --> 02:10.747
Oh.

02:12.116 --> 02:13.751
Yeah, I was, but...

02:13.784 --> 02:16.720
The Castillos
asked me to babysit, so.

02:16.754 --> 02:17.855
I thought all
your friends would be there.

02:17.889 --> 02:19.090
Are you sure
I didn't miss the turn?

02:19.123 --> 02:20.523
No, it's up a little further.

02:20.557 --> 02:22.492
And only Kate, but...

02:22.525 --> 02:25.863
It's fine though, I... I'd
honestly rather be babysitting.

02:25.897 --> 02:27.765
That's what I'm worried about.

02:27.798 --> 02:29.432
What do you mean?

02:29.466 --> 02:32.003
Josie, I feel like you aren't...

02:32.036 --> 02:33.971
I don't know,
making the most of your life.

02:34.005 --> 02:35.306
You think
partying would fix that?

02:35.339 --> 02:37.909
No, but I just
wish you'd let yourself have fun

02:37.942 --> 02:39.542
every once in a while.

02:39.576 --> 02:41.178
And with people your own age.

02:41.212 --> 02:42.847
I have fun when
I'm at Mustard Seeds.

02:42.880 --> 02:45.582
It's... I just...
the house is up ahead.

02:45.615 --> 02:48.618
Look, mom, I appreciate you
worrying about me,

02:48.652 --> 02:50.788
but I'm fine.

02:50.821 --> 02:51.956
I promise.

02:51.989 --> 02:54.658
Okay, if you say so.

02:54.691 --> 02:55.659
Well, keep me updated

02:55.692 --> 02:56.693
on when you think the parents
will be home.

02:56.726 --> 02:57.762
I hope it's not too late.

02:57.795 --> 02:58.863
It shouldn't be.

02:58.896 --> 03:00.563
Love you, be safe.

03:00.597 --> 03:02.033
Always am.

03:02.066 --> 03:04.035
I love you, too.

03:04.068 --> 03:05.069
Bye.

03:18.682 --> 03:24.621
1, 2, 3, 4,

03:24.654 --> 03:28.759
5, 6, 7,

03:28.793 --> 03:32.229
8, 9, 10!

03:32.263 --> 03:34.231
Ready or not, here I come!

03:36.901 --> 03:39.136
Sophia.

03:58.923 --> 04:00.825
Sophia!

04:27.717 --> 04:29.920
Oh, Sophia!

05:00.751 --> 05:01.684
Ha!

05:02.719 --> 05:03.653
Shit.

Jeez.

07:18.489 --> 07:19.423
Hello?

07:19.456 --> 07:21.825
<i>Josie, you comin' or what?</i>

07:21.859 --> 07:23.027
<i>Everyone's here!</i>

07:23.060 --> 07:25.062
Oh, um, no.

07:25.095 --> 07:26.197
Uh, no, not tonight.

07:26.230 --> 07:28.299
<i>Not tonight?</i>

07:28.332 --> 07:31.969
<i>This is the Christmas party,
it only comes once a year.</i>

07:32.002 --> 07:33.337
Uh, a babysitting gig came up.

07:33.370 --> 07:34.638
<i>Babysitting?</i>

07:34.672 --> 07:38.275
<i>Josie, Keith Calhoun has been
asking about you all night!</i>

07:38.309 --> 07:40.110
- <i>Get over here!</i>
- I know, I know, but, um...

07:40.144 --> 07:41.879
<i>But what?</i>

07:41.912 --> 07:43.347
I... I can't.

07:43.380 --> 07:44.481
<i>Holy hell, Josie,</i>

07:44.515 --> 07:46.884
<i>if only there was a camp badge
for getting laid.</i>

07:46.917 --> 07:47.985
<i>You gotta grow up sometime.</i>

07:48.018 --> 07:49.853
Hey, sorry, Kate, I gotta go.

07:49.887 --> 07:51.188
<i>You wanna spend
the rest of your life as a baby...</i>

08:17.147 --> 08:19.316
I don't know
where Sophia could be.

08:19.350 --> 08:23.053
I mean I've searched
like every inch of this house

08:23.087 --> 08:25.289
except for the one spot
where Sophia knows

08:25.322 --> 08:27.057
that she's never allowed
to hide,

08:27.091 --> 08:29.260
'cause it's so dangerous.

08:32.162 --> 08:36.900
And I know that Sophia
would never break any rules,

08:36.933 --> 08:39.470
she's a little angel.

08:39.503 --> 08:41.238
- Oh!
- Aah!

08:41.272 --> 08:43.107
You can't hide in there,
little monster,

08:43.140 --> 08:45.509
- you could have suffocated!
- I know.

08:45.542 --> 08:46.910
I tricked you, Josie.

08:46.944 --> 08:49.146
Alright, come on.

08:51.115 --> 08:53.117
Come on,
let's get out of here.

08:55.386 --> 08:59.356
Plus, it's not fair,
you were totally cheating.

08:59.390 --> 09:01.859
And whoa-ho!

09:01.892 --> 09:03.060
What are these?

09:03.093 --> 09:05.496
My ninja swords for protection.

09:05.529 --> 09:07.298
Well, you have me for that.

09:07.331 --> 09:09.833
And besides,
if you hurt yourself with these,

09:09.867 --> 09:11.235
then all our fun would be over.

09:12.569 --> 09:14.305
Think I can hit the bull's-eye
from here?

09:14.338 --> 09:16.140
No way.

09:16.173 --> 09:17.308
Watch this.

09:33.991 --> 09:35.492
Oh.

09:35.526 --> 09:38.629
Okay, just don't... don't
tell your parents about that.

09:38.662 --> 09:41.498
Okay.

09:46.603 --> 09:48.505
I'm the hide-and-seek king.

09:48.539 --> 09:52.042
Huh, no one's better
at hide-and-seek than me.

09:52.076 --> 09:54.611
Where is this pizza guy?

09:54.645 --> 09:58.148
Can we play
again after pizza, mom?

09:58.182 --> 09:59.116
Mom?

10:00.284 --> 10:02.152
I'm your friend Josie, silly.

10:04.254 --> 10:07.391
One more time after pizza,
promise?

10:08.459 --> 10:09.593
Alright.

10:09.626 --> 10:12.930
Cross my heart and hope to die,
Mustard Seed's honor.

10:15.499 --> 10:16.433
Pizza's here.

10:25.042 --> 10:25.909
Oh, shoot,
I did not mean to scare you.

10:25.943 --> 10:28.979
Wow, you guys are home
like super early.

10:29.012 --> 10:30.981
- The party was...
- Not cool enough, apparently.

10:31.715 --> 10:33.217
Hey, Mrs. Castillo.

10:35.252 --> 10:37.287
You're not pizza.

10:37.321 --> 10:39.356
Well,
you're not exactly pizza either.

10:39.390 --> 10:41.058
Am I right, Jen?

10:41.091 --> 10:42.092
Come here.

10:43.360 --> 10:46.263
Mmm, muah.

10:46.296 --> 10:48.165
- How was she?
- She was great.

10:48.198 --> 10:50.300
We played hide-and-go-seek, we...

10:50.334 --> 10:53.103
I almost suffocated.

10:53.137 --> 10:54.571
Wha...

10:54.605 --> 10:56.940
Oh, who's ready to rock out
with their cunt...

10:56.974 --> 10:57.908
Patch!

10:59.676 --> 11:01.345
Oh, shit, sorry.

11:02.546 --> 11:04.081
What are we drinkin'?

11:04.114 --> 11:06.083
Your options are coffee
or coffee.

11:07.418 --> 11:08.385
Oh, hey.

11:08.419 --> 11:10.053
Hey, Sadie.

11:10.087 --> 11:11.021
It's been forever, right?

11:11.054 --> 11:13.056
Like graduation?

11:13.090 --> 11:14.091
Why haven't I seen you?

11:14.124 --> 11:16.560
- I've just been busy I guess.
- I don't know.

11:16.593 --> 11:18.395
I... I follow you
on Instagram though.

11:18.429 --> 11:22.666
Josie Jane, you still doin'
the babysitter thing?

11:22.699 --> 11:24.701
Um, just while I'm getting
my degree in teaching,

11:24.735 --> 11:25.736
primary education.

11:25.770 --> 11:27.671
Wait, you're in college?

11:27.704 --> 11:29.740
I thought
you're like 16 or something.

11:29.774 --> 11:32.376
Patch, we were friends
in high school.

11:32.409 --> 11:34.478
Elementary school.

11:34.511 --> 11:35.679
She knows I'm kidding.

11:35.712 --> 11:38.148
You know, I'm kidding,
right, Josie?

11:38.182 --> 11:39.750
I mean just 'cause she dresses
like a 12-year-old...

11:39.784 --> 11:41.251
Patch, stop it!

11:41.285 --> 11:42.586
Two hours into the party

11:42.619 --> 11:46.223
and the boys are suddenly seized
by some amazing idea

11:46.256 --> 11:48.959
for a new track, so here we are.

11:50.194 --> 11:52.296
Man, you guys are brutal.

11:52.329 --> 11:54.131
And now, Sadie's gonna show me
her designs.

11:54.164 --> 11:55.232
- Yes.
- Oh, for your store?

11:55.265 --> 11:56.166
You're... you're doing it?

My parents only made me go
the one year.

12:38.342 --> 12:39.743
How many years
did you have to go?

12:39.777 --> 12:41.512
Um, uh, pretty much
every summer,

12:41.545 --> 12:44.081
for like 10 years,

14:04.227 --> 14:05.897
8, 1000.

14:05.930 --> 14:07.230
What's wrong with your Wi-Fi?

14:07.264 --> 14:07.731
Oh, one thing at a time, ladies.

Oh!

Sophia, run.

What do you want?

This one thinks
she can demand answers.

15:55.639 --> 15:57.574
Walk in there with the others,

You disobey,
I hurt your child.

16:16.660 --> 16:17.762
Oh, my God.

16:20.965 --> 16:22.666
No, no, no, no!

16:23.567 --> 16:24.568
No!

16:26.703 --> 16:28.305
What do you want?

16:28.338 --> 16:29.874
Not you.

16:29.907 --> 16:30.842
Sadie!

16:39.750 --> 16:41.718
I will kill you.

16:41.753 --> 16:44.321
She's not on the list,
she doesn't matter.

16:44.354 --> 16:46.958
You're not on the list,
you don't matter.

17:03.440 --> 17:04.540
Your friends are dead.

17:06.877 --> 17:09.346
Because I've chosen,
as is my right,

17:09.378 --> 17:11.515
to spare them
what is to come next.

17:15.385 --> 17:17.319
We carry on.

18:25.422 --> 18:28.960
Sophie, it's gonna be okay.

18:28.993 --> 18:31.394
- I promise.
- Liar!

18:31.428 --> 18:34.131
You cannot promise her that.

18:38.836 --> 18:40.503
Can you please just let us talk?

18:40.537 --> 18:41.806
Silence!

18:54.986 --> 18:56.686
Stand down!

18:56.720 --> 18:58.455
Stand down.

19:02.927 --> 19:06.130
You could have ruined
everything.

19:06.163 --> 19:09.033
We do things in order.

19:11.002 --> 19:12.502
Take him.

20:00.051 --> 20:01.484
I have money.

20:01.518 --> 20:02.652
I can get you whatever you want.

20:06.623 --> 20:10.161
I severed your phone lines,
your alarms, your internet.

20:10.194 --> 20:12.063
I've disabled
all your fancy cars.

20:13.965 --> 20:15.266
You're cut off!

20:16.968 --> 20:18.035
Adrift.

20:20.938 --> 20:22.073
Who are you?

20:22.106 --> 20:23.107
What do you want?

20:23.140 --> 20:26.509
We are what comes next.

20:27.812 --> 20:30.982
We are not interested
in your money.

20:31.015 --> 20:33.616
It means nothing to us.

20:33.650 --> 20:35.552
You mean nothing to us.

20:35.585 --> 20:37.989
Just a means to an end.

20:41.959 --> 20:43.194
We carry on.

20:45.229 --> 20:47.530
Understand this!

20:47.564 --> 20:50.768
There's nothing you can do,
nothing you can say,

20:50.801 --> 20:55.139
there are no words,
no prayers, pleads

20:55.172 --> 20:57.074
that are gonna stop
what's about to unfold here,

20:57.108 --> 20:58.009
Rick Castillo.

21:00.911 --> 21:04.081
But you don't understand just
how much money I can get you.

21:14.591 --> 21:17.694
No, wait, listen, I can pay...

21:24.268 --> 21:26.971
Listen, we have another
cell phone upstairs.

21:27.004 --> 21:29.006
You can use that access
to all of our accounts ev...

21:29.040 --> 21:31.142
Oh!

21:31.175 --> 21:33.643
There are some things
money can't buy.

21:36.713 --> 21:37.982
Understand?

21:44.355 --> 21:46.290
Upstairs in the bedroom,
just get it.

21:46.323 --> 21:47.892
You can...
Ow!

21:49.260 --> 21:51.829
Do you still think we're after
your money, Big Rick?

21:51.862 --> 21:54.165
Now, shut up,
nobody's goin' anywhere.

22:26.696 --> 22:28.099
You have a job to do.

22:57.761 --> 22:58.963
Tell me, Rick,

23:00.865 --> 23:02.933
how long have you lived
in this house?

23:02.967 --> 23:05.169
About 10 years.

23:09.739 --> 23:11.308
10 years, huh?

23:17.781 --> 23:19.283
In those 10 years...

23:25.189 --> 23:27.391
...you seen anything
that looks like this?

23:32.129 --> 23:33.063
A box?

23:38.402 --> 23:41.906
We have some jewelry boxes
and a safe.

23:41.939 --> 23:46.477
This is why we mark our bodies,
reshape ourselves.

23:48.179 --> 23:50.247
People like you are content

23:50.281 --> 23:53.117
to live in the image
of their silent God!

24:02.493 --> 24:05.462
And just like Him,

24:07.464 --> 24:09.300
you don't listen.

24:23.247 --> 24:26.884
I didn't ask if you brought
something into this house.

24:26.917 --> 24:29.153
I asked if you discovered it.

24:31.188 --> 24:32.456
I'm... I'm sorry.

24:32.489 --> 24:35.526
No, we never discovered
anything here.

25:42.059 --> 25:45.195
You know who once
lived and died in these walls?

25:45.229 --> 25:50.401
No, it...
it was uh, empty for years before us.

25:50.434 --> 25:51.502
Decades probably.

25:51.535 --> 25:53.404
Ever wonder why that is, Rick?

25:56.206 --> 25:58.175
What the...

26:00.911 --> 26:02.479
What was that?

26:02.513 --> 26:04.214
- What?
- That noise!

26:04.248 --> 26:06.617
You're losing control
of the situation.

26:06.650 --> 26:08.118
You would spill the blood
of the father...

26:08.152 --> 26:10.587
There is somebody else
in this house.

26:19.330 --> 26:20.397
No, that's us.

26:25.302 --> 26:26.937
We have begun.

26:28.605 --> 26:30.341
There's no one else here

26:30.374 --> 26:33.010
and you are wasting
precious time.

26:36.313 --> 26:37.548
Why are you...

26:39.049 --> 26:41.518
No more words.

26:43.287 --> 26:44.922
Take them down, all of them.

26:46.924 --> 26:48.258
You ain't over me.

27:27.564 --> 27:30.567
Sophia, do you wanna know
a secret?

27:33.704 --> 27:35.339
Open your eyes, Sophia.

27:38.475 --> 27:41.578
Open your eyes now!

27:44.581 --> 27:46.383
I'm the devil.

28:49.313 --> 28:50.147
That's it?

28:53.050 --> 28:57.354
Think about this house
and what it means.

28:57.387 --> 28:59.556
Did this room call to you
or did you just start

28:59.590 --> 29:01.592
with the first room
that you saw?

29:01.625 --> 29:04.495
The box will call to you.

29:04.528 --> 29:06.396
Are you listening?

29:06.430 --> 29:09.233
Think blueprints,
think locations

29:09.266 --> 29:12.536
that were marked in these walls.

29:12.569 --> 29:15.105
Those locations are finite.

29:15.138 --> 29:18.308
As finite as the true universe.

29:18.342 --> 29:23.413
In a finite universe,
all mystery is extinct.

29:23.447 --> 29:24.581
Listen.

29:24.615 --> 29:27.084
Does the box call to you now?

30:26.577 --> 30:27.644
Here?

31:33.911 --> 31:35.612
Why are you stopping?

31:38.783 --> 31:42.185
Yeah, she bit your hand,
and you almost killed her,

31:43.855 --> 31:45.923
and now,
you wanna finish the job.

31:52.429 --> 31:53.697
What is your name?

31:55.632 --> 31:56.667
Boy.

31:57.969 --> 32:01.238
Hmm, an old-school breed.

32:01.271 --> 32:03.273
You listen to me, Boy.

32:03.306 --> 32:07.377
It is never productive
to live outside the task.

32:07.411 --> 32:08.980
That family downstairs,

32:09.013 --> 32:11.615
they will all be destroyed
tonight.

32:11.648 --> 32:15.419
We will feed them to this house.

32:15.452 --> 32:17.922
That's why we need to find
the box.

32:19.556 --> 32:21.759
What does it say in here?

32:26.596 --> 32:29.967
We are what comes next.

32:30.001 --> 32:31.869
This world is ours to destroy.

32:33.570 --> 32:36.707
With the tools of man
and the blood of our enemy.

32:36.740 --> 32:38.608
We are what comes next.

32:38.642 --> 32:41.745
This world is ours to remake
for our own.

32:41.779 --> 32:44.281
No law but our will.

32:44.314 --> 32:46.450
No God but our desire.

32:46.483 --> 32:47.919
We are what comes next.

32:49.286 --> 32:50.888
We are the divide.

32:54.591 --> 32:55.860
But the f...

32:55.893 --> 32:58.462
The only way
that family dies

32:58.495 --> 33:02.399
is with their blood spilling
from the black masks.

33:02.432 --> 33:05.569
That is the ritual,
that's how it works.

33:09.040 --> 33:10.741
This is our time.

33:13.310 --> 33:19.282
So go find the box now
or this is all for nothing.

34:02.994 --> 34:04.361
<i>What's this?</i>

34:05.997 --> 34:07.631
They were yelling
about a pizza guy before,

34:07.664 --> 34:08.966
that's all this is.

34:38.228 --> 34:40.730
No, stay hidden.

34:40.764 --> 34:42.399
I'll get rid of him.

35:09.026 --> 35:13.630
Of course,
it's black, definitely and...

35:13.663 --> 35:15.565
- Well, the house?
- No, it's older.

35:22.539 --> 35:24.108
Oh, hey, call you back.

35:24.141 --> 35:25.042
Ugh, so sorry.

35:25.076 --> 35:27.477
I... I got lost tryin'
to find this place

35:27.510 --> 35:29.046
all the way up here.

35:29.080 --> 35:30.147
Tried to call
like a thousand times,

35:30.181 --> 35:31.715
but I... I guess your phones
are out or somethin'.

35:32.783 --> 35:35.619
Obviously, this is free.

35:35.652 --> 35:37.587
Also, I got some coupons here
for you somewhere.

35:37.621 --> 35:38.421
We don't need any.

35:38.455 --> 35:39.589
No, no, no,
these are really good.

35:39.623 --> 35:40.490
Hang on.

35:40.523 --> 35:42.159
Hope I didn't leave 'em
in my ride.

35:42.193 --> 35:45.029
These are like BOGO you know,
buy one, get one free.

35:51.668 --> 35:54.872
Uh, everything okay in there?

35:57.507 --> 35:58.109
Remodeling.

35:58.142 --> 35:59.743
Ah!

35:59.777 --> 36:01.045
A late-night remodeling.

36:02.046 --> 36:03.580
Decent.

36:03.613 --> 36:04.547
Decent.

36:09.619 --> 36:11.155
Oh, ah, ha, found 'em!

36:11.188 --> 36:14.058
Okay, again, so sorry.

36:14.091 --> 36:17.929
Look, if uh, Mr. Lawrence Eddie
didn't find out about this,

36:17.962 --> 36:20.231
I'd really...
Whoa, dude!

36:20.264 --> 36:22.499
What is that?

36:22.532 --> 36:23.868
Is that Rick Castillo?

36:23.901 --> 36:24.969
Does he live here?

36:26.703 --> 36:29.240
Oh man, shut up right now, uh...

36:29.273 --> 36:29.941
This is like a life goal.

36:29.974 --> 36:32.810
I'm... uh, I'm more than a fan.

36:32.843 --> 36:35.478
I'm literally like a student
of his entire career.

36:35.512 --> 36:38.515
Mr. Castillo is not at home,
it is late.

36:38.548 --> 36:42.619
I'm sure you can understand
how he would like his privacy.

36:42.652 --> 36:44.255
Oh, uh, yeah.
So sorry.

36:44.288 --> 36:46.456
Uh, have a terrific night
and everything!

36:52.129 --> 36:55.699
Dude, can you guess
where I'm standing right now?

36:55.732 --> 36:56.700
Why would you assume

36:56.733 --> 36:58.970
that means I'm standing
on top of something?

37:00.037 --> 37:01.839
He's talking too much.

37:05.810 --> 37:08.079
Just... just stop.

37:08.112 --> 37:09.280
Okay, you're never gonna get it,
okay?

37:09.313 --> 37:11.048
I'll just tell you.

37:11.082 --> 37:15.618
I am currently
at Rick Castillo's front yard,

37:15.652 --> 37:16.686
for real.

37:16.720 --> 37:20.590
The biggest music producer
in the world lives here.

37:20.623 --> 37:23.894
No, I didn't actually meet him.

37:26.629 --> 37:27.664
...one-eyed lady.

37:28.933 --> 37:30.001
Hey, can I call you back?

37:40.011 --> 37:41.112
Oh.

37:47.650 --> 37:49.020
Uh...

37:51.255 --> 37:52.790
Oh, hey there, I was just...

37:52.823 --> 37:54.091
Why are you still here?

37:55.760 --> 37:58.062
- Uh, what?
- Answer the question.

37:58.095 --> 37:59.263
Uh...

37:59.296 --> 38:02.233
Why are you taking
pictures of this house?

38:03.834 --> 38:06.636
Answer the question!

38:08.806 --> 38:12.043
Look, I gotta...
I got some more pies to deliver.

38:21.118 --> 38:22.787
Okay.

38:22.820 --> 38:24.855
Okay, I just wanna say...

38:36.033 --> 38:37.700
Still adjusting.

38:50.314 --> 38:51.916
Not cool, lady.

38:51.949 --> 38:53.884
Why did I have to sacrifice
my good eye?

38:53.918 --> 38:54.952
Not cool.

38:55.953 --> 38:56.887
Finish him.

38:58.055 --> 39:00.825
Rick Castillo's my hero,
alright?

39:00.858 --> 39:02.093
I'm sorry.

39:40.798 --> 39:43.134
You said
you were gonna handle it.

39:43.167 --> 39:44.969
There's people that know
he's here.

39:47.304 --> 39:48.839
I handled it.

40:39.390 --> 40:40.457
What's happening?

40:40.491 --> 40:41.292
Who's shooting?

40:41.325 --> 40:42.159
It was the pizza guy.

40:42.193 --> 40:43.160
We have to hurry,
they're all outside,

40:43.194 --> 40:45.896
and listen, I found the phone,
but it's dead.

40:45.930 --> 40:47.932
Forget the phone,
take Sophia first.

40:47.965 --> 40:49.233
- Go out back and we can...
- Right, I'll...

40:49.266 --> 40:50.367
No.

40:50.401 --> 40:51.368
No, wait,
we won't get past them,

40:51.402 --> 40:52.970
- they're all out front.
- How many are up there?

40:53.003 --> 40:53.671
I think three.

40:53.703 --> 40:55.105
They don't know that I'm here.

41:02.546 --> 41:03.514
Hide, put the tape back.

41:03.547 --> 41:04.949
There's definitely chargers
there upstairs.

41:04.982 --> 41:06.083
Okay, I'll find something.

41:06.116 --> 41:07.284
I promise I will help.

41:07.318 --> 41:09.019
Don't leave.

41:09.053 --> 41:10.120
Okay.

41:10.154 --> 41:12.089
Okay, Sophia, listen,
they can't know I was here,

41:12.122 --> 41:13.190
okay?

41:13.224 --> 41:14.358
I want you to put your hands
right behind your back

41:14.391 --> 41:16.427
like you're still tied, okay?

41:16.460 --> 41:18.262
Nothing will stop me
from coming back for you.

41:24.535 --> 41:26.736
I'll be back, I promise.

42:56.627 --> 42:58.896
You were right, Boy.

42:58.929 --> 43:00.464
We have mice.

43:05.569 --> 43:08.038
Who are you?

43:08.072 --> 43:09.940
I'm just the babysitter.

43:09.973 --> 43:11.075
Did you get her?

43:11.108 --> 43:13.043
Yeah, it's the damn babysitter.

43:13.077 --> 43:14.478
Weren't you supposed
to have taken care

43:14.511 --> 43:15.946
of the babysitter?

43:18.682 --> 43:20.384
I thought
that was the babysitter.

43:20.417 --> 43:23.320
Does that look
like a babysitter?

43:23.354 --> 43:24.888
What does a babysitter
look like?

43:24.922 --> 43:26.090
Like this!

43:26.123 --> 43:27.091
Please.

43:41.238 --> 43:42.239
Stop.

43:47.378 --> 43:49.346
What's the condition
of the mother?

43:49.380 --> 43:51.248
She's still breathin'.

43:51.281 --> 43:53.384
Cranial hemorrhaging.

43:53.417 --> 43:54.351
She's definitely dying.

43:54.385 --> 43:56.420
We need to get this done
before that happens.

43:58.589 --> 44:01.291
Well, if it happens,
we have a backup.

44:03.560 --> 44:05.062
We carry on.

44:10.401 --> 44:12.369
Your babysitter blood
is a poor substitute

44:12.403 --> 44:14.405
of the mother's.

44:16.273 --> 44:18.409
But I won't tell her
if you won't.

44:24.248 --> 44:25.215
You won't get away with this.

44:30.587 --> 44:31.488
Did you...

44:33.056 --> 44:35.359
Did you just say something
to me, little mouse?

44:41.398 --> 44:43.700
I thought
I heard you say something.

44:49.573 --> 44:50.407
No?

44:52.709 --> 44:54.945
I didn't think so.

45:01.018 --> 45:02.019
Okay.

45:31.315 --> 45:34.384
We carry on.

45:40.825 --> 45:44.762
This world is ours to destroy.

45:46.663 --> 45:52.636
With the tools of man
and the blood of our enemy.

45:52.669 --> 45:55.539
We are what comes next.

45:55.572 --> 45:59.243
This world is ours to remake
as our own.

45:59.276 --> 46:01.612
No law but our will.

46:01.645 --> 46:04.314
No God but our desire!

46:05.616 --> 46:09.653
We are the divide.

46:54.665 --> 46:55.666
Josie.

46:57.501 --> 46:58.770
Oh, oh, oh, my gosh!

47:00.437 --> 47:02.172
Are you dead?

47:02.673 --> 47:04.776
So sorry.

47:04.809 --> 47:06.143
I'm sorry.

47:07.711 --> 47:09.613
About what?
About not being dead?

47:11.148 --> 47:13.617
I was such a bitch to you
in high school.

47:14.651 --> 47:15.552
What?

47:15.586 --> 47:18.388
You were just so uncool.

47:20.424 --> 47:25.128
You still are,
but that was so shitty of me.

47:27.698 --> 47:31.134
I mean we were best friends
in junior high.

47:31.168 --> 47:32.402
Elementary.

47:39.509 --> 47:40.912
But it's okay, Sadie,
we just...

47:40.945 --> 47:43.280
we just took different paths.

47:43.313 --> 47:44.748
But hey, do you... do you think
that you can reach

47:44.782 --> 47:46.450
that letter opener for me?

47:47.651 --> 47:48.585
It's just...
it's right over there

47:48.619 --> 47:49.620
on that table.

47:49.653 --> 47:51.688
If you could just grab it
and put it in my hands

47:51.722 --> 47:55.592
that'd be really nice
or um, cool.

47:55.626 --> 47:56.560
Okay.

47:59.630 --> 48:01.732
Come on, Sadie, you can do this.

48:02.767 --> 48:03.835
Come on, Sadie.

48:05.469 --> 48:07.671
Come on, Sadie, please,
you can do this.

48:09.406 --> 48:10.407
Come on, Sadie.

48:11.375 --> 48:12.309
Oh, come on.

48:13.310 --> 48:14.277
Please.

48:29.726 --> 48:32.462
Please, just put it in my hand.

48:41.738 --> 48:43.340
Oh, my gosh, Sadie.

48:43.373 --> 48:44.307
Sadie?

48:59.957 --> 49:01.658
I need you to drive this
into the woods

49:01.692 --> 49:02.927
and leave it there.

49:02.960 --> 49:04.695
Get back as fast as you can.

49:05.963 --> 49:09.901
Anybody stops you,
anybody sees you.

49:44.367 --> 49:46.403
Your mess is all cleaned up.

49:46.436 --> 49:47.004
<i>Stand guard.</i>

49:47.038 --> 49:49.306
<i>No more interruptions.</i>

51:22.867 --> 51:23.835
If you were gonna hit me,

51:23.868 --> 51:25.970
you would have already done it,
little girl.

51:29.706 --> 51:32.043
That's how I know
you're not gonna do it now.

51:44.454 --> 51:45.790
Put that down.

51:45.823 --> 51:46.824
Stay back!

51:47.624 --> 51:49.593
Put that down.

51:49.626 --> 51:50.962
Give me your hands.

51:51.896 --> 51:53.164
Sit tight and shut up,

51:53.197 --> 51:55.632
you might actually see
another sunrise.

51:56.666 --> 51:57.802
You're a lying sack of crap.

51:57.835 --> 51:58.903
Maybe.

52:03.908 --> 52:05.142
First...

52:07.144 --> 52:09.046
You're gonna
have a really long night.

52:10.781 --> 52:12.515
I'm gonna make a woman
out of you.

52:21.926 --> 52:24.061
You think you can take me, huh?

52:26.831 --> 52:29.133
Oh, think you could do me
some damage?

52:31.668 --> 52:32.970
I'll... I'll stop you.

52:33.004 --> 52:34.471
No!

52:36.007 --> 52:38.475
What happens after you hit me
with that, huh?

52:38.508 --> 52:40.044
What do you think?

52:40.077 --> 52:41.012
One tap.

52:42.479 --> 52:45.415
That's it, lights out,
end of my story?

52:47.818 --> 52:48.819
To get at me with that

52:48.853 --> 52:51.454
you're gonna have
to hit me again,

52:51.488 --> 52:56.227
and again, and again,
and again, and again!

52:56.260 --> 52:59.729
Till my head is a bloody pulp!

52:59.764 --> 53:01.799
You think you're made for that?

53:04.135 --> 53:06.636
Because if my head's
not a bloody pulp,

53:06.670 --> 53:07.905
I'm gonna keep gettin' up

53:07.939 --> 53:09.807
and I'd keep comin' for you
with this!

53:11.175 --> 53:13.543
That's the difference
between us.

53:13.576 --> 53:14.812
I will.

53:14.845 --> 53:16.180
I will stop you.

53:22.652 --> 53:23.620
Look at you.

53:26.690 --> 53:27.992
You're a spoiled child.

53:30.527 --> 53:34.198
When I was a child
I was raised to hurt people.

53:34.231 --> 53:36.167
I liked hurting people.

53:38.202 --> 53:40.737
I still like hurting people.

53:41.973 --> 53:43.808
You understand?

53:45.943 --> 53:51.215
I bet you've never hurt anybody
in your whole life.

53:52.850 --> 53:55.186
I'm willing to bet my blood
on it.

54:00.958 --> 54:01.993
God.

54:02.026 --> 54:06.197
You can't do nothin',
because you ain't nothin'.

54:07.765 --> 54:10.835
This was always gonna
happen here, babysitter.

54:12.870 --> 54:15.572
Now, give me your hands!

54:20.311 --> 54:21.979
You're right.

54:27.952 --> 54:31.122
My whole life
I've never hurt anybody.

54:31.155 --> 54:32.790
Not even to defend myself.

54:33.824 --> 54:34.657
Not even a little.

54:37.627 --> 54:39.196
Not even once.

54:50.374 --> 54:51.909
But I am ready to try.

55:44.795 --> 55:47.965
You're a weak little girl,
just like the rest.

56:21.731 --> 56:23.968
Never underestimate
a Mustard Seed.

57:05.910 --> 57:08.212
Your parents need a timeout.

57:14.051 --> 57:19.023
But you and me, Sophia,
we're gonna stay up all night

57:19.056 --> 57:21.158
and greet the new world.

58:54.251 --> 58:55.185
No!

58:55.219 --> 58:57.988
No!

58:58.022 --> 58:58.989
No!

01:00:14.164 --> 01:00:15.666
Harder they fall.

01:00:22.573 --> 01:00:25.542
Sophia, you ever lay awake
at night,

01:00:25.576 --> 01:00:27.077
because you're scared
of the big bad monster

01:00:27.111 --> 01:00:28.112
under the bed?

01:00:33.183 --> 01:00:34.985
Wanna see what lives
under the monster's bed?

01:00:35.018 --> 01:00:37.254
Get away from her,
you psycho.

01:02:15.787 --> 01:02:17.721
What happened to the other one?

01:02:17.755 --> 01:02:19.490
Did you betray him, too?

01:02:21.725 --> 01:02:23.360
Babysitter.

01:02:25.262 --> 01:02:26.196
She's here.

01:02:56.159 --> 01:02:58.462
Where are you going?

01:02:58.495 --> 01:03:01.598
♪ We hike, and we camp,
and we do good deeds ♪

01:03:01.632 --> 01:03:04.234
♪ This is the song
of the Mustard Seeds ♪

01:03:05.803 --> 01:03:09.072
♪ We hike, and we camp,
and we do good deeds ♪

01:03:09.106 --> 01:03:12.010
♪ This is the song
of the Mustard Seeds ♪

01:03:22.854 --> 01:03:24.221
Josie?

01:03:28.692 --> 01:03:30.093
Josie.

01:03:31.361 --> 01:03:33.798
You lose somethin',
little mouse?

01:03:33.831 --> 01:03:36.801
Looks like your mom's
worried about you.

01:03:36.834 --> 01:03:38.770
How do you think she'd feel
if she found out

01:03:38.803 --> 01:03:41.204
that her little mouse is dead?

01:04:01.525 --> 01:04:04.762
I am not gonna chase you,
babysitter,

01:04:04.796 --> 01:04:06.430
because I don't have to.

01:04:07.598 --> 01:04:12.169
You got nowhere to run,
nowhere to hide.

01:04:12.202 --> 01:04:15.907
You don't matter.

01:04:15.940 --> 01:04:20.377
I order you to come down
here now.

01:04:20.410 --> 01:04:22.746
If you're not in front of me
in three seconds,

01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:27.885
I will go down below
and I will destroy that family.

01:04:27.919 --> 01:04:29.787
And it'll be all your fault.

01:04:29.821 --> 01:04:31.622
- So little mouse, get...
- No, you won't.

01:04:33.223 --> 01:04:34.658
'Cause I've got your box.

01:04:36.727 --> 01:04:38.695
You give it to me

01:04:40.397 --> 01:04:44.201
or I will kill
that entire family!

01:04:44.234 --> 01:04:45.736
But you can't, right?

01:04:45.770 --> 01:04:48.171
'Cause I've got
your stupid masks.

01:05:16.333 --> 01:05:18.168
What are you doin' out
of your chair?

01:05:21.773 --> 01:05:23.206
Brave girl.

01:05:26.510 --> 01:05:28.745
Bad things happen down there.

01:05:32.817 --> 01:05:35.552
Little mouse!

01:05:37.354 --> 01:05:39.924
I have the girl here with me.

01:05:39.957 --> 01:05:46.363
Understand this, little mouse,
you are nothing but alone.

01:05:46.396 --> 01:05:49.399
Your police,
they're not coming for you.

01:05:49.433 --> 01:05:52.703
Your mommy
is not coming for you.

01:05:52.736 --> 01:05:56.908
Father, Sons, Holy Ghosts,

01:05:56.941 --> 01:06:01.813
your silent God
doesn't care about you.

01:06:01.846 --> 01:06:05.482
No one cares about you,
you're all alone.

01:06:05.515 --> 01:06:08.920
Your world ends now!

01:06:08.953 --> 01:06:12.790
Sophia,
come find me if you can.

01:06:15.692 --> 01:06:18.729
The only thing coming for you,
little mouse,

01:06:18.763 --> 01:06:20.965
is the end of your world.

01:06:22.365 --> 01:06:24.001
I promise

01:06:24.035 --> 01:06:27.038
with all my heart, mind,
and might.

01:06:27.071 --> 01:06:29.372
I know where you're hiding,
little mouse.

01:06:29.406 --> 01:06:31.976
To always be prepared,
carry the burden,

01:06:32.009 --> 01:06:33.276
fix the broken.

01:06:33.310 --> 01:06:35.612
Nothing any of you did here
matter.

01:06:35.645 --> 01:06:37.280
Protect the preyed upon.

01:06:37.314 --> 01:06:40.450
I will still open the door
tonight.

01:06:40.484 --> 01:06:41.618
And be strong.

01:06:41.651 --> 01:06:45.589
And what comes through that door
will remake this world.

01:06:45.622 --> 01:06:46.924
Brave.

01:06:46.958 --> 01:06:49.426
Starting with the annihilation
of this family.

01:06:49.459 --> 01:06:50.460
Honest and true.

01:06:50.494 --> 01:06:53.965
And there's not a thing
you can do to stop it.

01:06:53.998 --> 01:06:56.333
In all that I do.

01:06:56.366 --> 01:06:57.869
Little mouse.

01:07:05.777 --> 01:07:07.511
Let her go!

01:07:09.013 --> 01:07:11.648
Do you know the agony I can
deliver to this child here?

01:07:11.681 --> 01:07:13.650
- 10 seconds!
- What?

01:07:13.683 --> 01:07:16.087
These are your carotid arteries,
they carry oxygen to your brain.

01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:16.921
If I puncture them both,

01:07:16.954 --> 01:07:18.756
your brain goes dark
in 10 seconds.

01:07:18.790 --> 01:07:19.589
You don't wanna kill me.

01:07:19.623 --> 01:07:21.424
Well,
I don't want to kill anyone!

01:07:21.458 --> 01:07:22.794
Which is why
I'm giving you one chance,

01:07:22.827 --> 01:07:23.895
but only one!

01:07:25.997 --> 01:07:27.799
You let her go,
you put down your knife,

01:07:27.832 --> 01:07:29.733
and you lay face down
or I bleed you out.

01:07:29.767 --> 01:07:32.335
Not a single word,
not a single syllable!

01:07:32.369 --> 01:07:35.572
You do as I say or you die.

01:07:35.605 --> 01:07:36.673
Run.

01:07:36.706 --> 01:07:39.076
Ready or not, make your choice.

01:07:41.078 --> 01:07:42.345
Oh, little m...

01:07:43.380 --> 01:07:44.115
Run, Sophia!

01:07:44.148 --> 01:07:46.117
10!

01:07:46.150 --> 01:07:48.052
9!

01:07:48.085 --> 01:07:49.987
8!

01:07:50.021 --> 01:07:51.022
7!

01:07:52.156 --> 01:07:53.323
6!

01:07:54.091 --> 01:07:55.059
5!

01:07:56.127 --> 01:07:58.062
4!

01:08:00.097 --> 01:08:01.631
3!

01:08:01.665 --> 01:08:02.632
No!

01:08:06.603 --> 01:08:07.805
We carry on.

01:08:43.975 --> 01:08:44.975
Josie.

01:08:46.475 --> 01:08:48.078
It's okay, it's all over.

01:08:58.856 --> 01:09:04.627
Power, unholy and unspeakable.

01:09:04.661 --> 01:09:08.832
Power to remake this weak world
in our image,

01:09:08.866 --> 01:09:12.770
Power to cheat death
and live forever.

01:09:12.803 --> 01:09:13.871
We're safe now.

01:09:13.904 --> 01:09:14.738
In darkness.

01:09:14.772 --> 01:09:16.538
Mustard Seed's honor.

01:09:16.573 --> 01:09:19.176
We are the divide.

01:09:19.210 --> 01:09:21.578
We carry on.

01:09:41.886 --> 01:09:46.886
