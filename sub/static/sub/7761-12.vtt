- * ONE, TWO, THREE,
FOUR, FIVE, SIX *

00:12.580 --> 00:13.647
* SHAKE IT, DUDE

00:13.681 --> 00:21.622
*

00:35.369 --> 00:38.839
- * CUE THE PULSE TO BEGIN

00:38.872 --> 00:46.280
*

00:46.314 --> 00:50.151
* CUE THE PULSE TO BEGIN

00:50.184 --> 00:53.587
* CUE THE PULSE TO BEGIN

00:53.621 --> 00:58.192
* CUE THE PULSE TO BEGIN

00:59.360 --> 01:01.629
[indistinct chatter]

01:01.662 --> 01:03.431
- HE'S NOT GETTING
INTO ANY MORE FIGHTS, IS HE?

01:03.464 --> 01:05.599
- OH, NO, NOTHING LIKE THAT.

01:05.633 --> 01:07.701
HUNTER HAS SHOWN
REMARKABLE PROGRESS.

01:07.735 --> 01:09.737
- THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR.

01:09.770 --> 01:11.305
- YES, HE'S EXTREMELY BRIGHT.

01:11.339 --> 01:12.840
- WELL, THAT RUNS
IN THE FAMILY.

01:12.873 --> 01:16.577
- HOWEVER, HE'S NOT
THE MOST DISCIPLINED STUDENT,

01:16.610 --> 01:19.213
AND HE HAS A TENDENCY
TO BE A BIT OF A...

01:19.247 --> 01:21.515
- SMART-ASS?

01:21.549 --> 01:23.384
RUNS IN THE FAMILY TOO.

01:23.417 --> 01:26.254
- BUT YOU'RE TO BE COMMENDED
FOR DOING AN EXCELLENT JOB.

01:26.287 --> 01:28.856
- AH, THANK YOU, MS. CROWE.

01:28.889 --> 01:31.859
- THANK YOU.

01:31.892 --> 01:33.361
DID YOU HEAR THAT?
THAT'S THE FIRST TIME A TEACHER

01:33.394 --> 01:35.196
HAS EVER GIVEN ME
AN "EXCELLENT."

01:35.229 --> 01:37.131
- [chuckles]

01:38.499 --> 01:41.202
- EXCUSE US.

01:41.235 --> 01:42.470
ARE YOU HUNTER'S PARENTS?

01:42.503 --> 01:43.537
- YES, THAT'S RIGHT.

01:43.571 --> 01:45.406
- WE'RE CALLIE'S FOLKS.

01:45.439 --> 01:47.241
- UH, CALLIE...

01:47.275 --> 01:48.876
- OUR KIDS
ARE SEEING ONE ANOTHER.

01:48.909 --> 01:51.279
- YES, OF COURSE,
THE FAMOUS CALLIE.

01:51.312 --> 01:53.347
- STEVE LEESON.
- AMBER MORGAN-LEESON.

01:53.381 --> 01:56.384
- BEN BRUCKNER.
- MICHAEL NOVOTNY-BRUCKNER.

01:56.417 --> 01:59.353
- HUNTER ALWAYS SPEAKS OF YOU
BOTH WITH SUCH ADMIRATION.

01:59.387 --> 02:00.921
- HE DOES?
- WELL, YOU KNOW HOW KIDS ARE.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.656
THEY'LL NEVER TELL YOU
TO YOUR FACE.

02:02.690 --> 02:04.225
- YEAH.
- MM.

02:04.258 --> 02:05.426
- CALLIE'S LIKE
A LITTLE SCHOOLGIRL

02:05.459 --> 02:07.261
EVERY TIME
SHE MENTIONS HIS NAME.

02:07.295 --> 02:09.630
- SHE IS A SCHOOLGIRL.
[laughter]

02:09.663 --> 02:11.365
- YOU SHOULD BE VERY PROUD.
HE'S A VERY NICE YOUNG MAN.

02:11.399 --> 02:13.634
- I THINK HE'D PREFER
"COOL DUDE."

02:13.667 --> 02:14.768
- [chuckles]

02:14.802 --> 02:16.404
LISTEN, UH, WE WOULD LOVE

02:16.437 --> 02:17.905
TO GET TOGETHER
WITH YOU GUYS.

02:17.938 --> 02:20.241
- THAT'D BE GREAT.
- I'LL BE IN TOUCH.

02:20.274 --> 02:21.442
WE'LL PLAN AN EVENING.
- TERRIFIC.

02:21.475 --> 02:23.277
- OKAY.
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

02:23.311 --> 02:26.146
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
- BYE-BYE.

02:34.322 --> 02:37.391
- HOW DOES THAT FEEL?

02:37.425 --> 02:39.693
- IT'D BE A LOT BETTER
WITH POPPERS.

02:39.727 --> 02:41.662
- TRY TO DESCRIBE
THE SENSATION.

02:41.695 --> 02:46.200
- IT FEELS AS IF SOMEONE
IS ROTATING MY ARTIFICIAL BALL.

02:47.901 --> 02:49.703
- [sighs]
PLEASE.

03:01.782 --> 03:04.218
YOU'VE PUT ON SOME WEIGHT.

03:04.252 --> 03:05.953
- I REALIZE TO YOU
THAT'S A GOOD THING.

03:05.986 --> 03:08.489
TO ME, IT'S A DISASTER.

03:08.522 --> 03:11.459
- YOU CAN DRESS NOW.

03:14.262 --> 03:15.496
- SO WHAT'S THE VERDICT?

03:15.529 --> 03:17.331
- ARE YOU STILL
EXPERIENCING FATIGUE?

03:17.365 --> 03:18.766
- NOT AS MUCH.

03:18.799 --> 03:19.833
- HOW'S YOUR SEX DRIVE?

03:19.867 --> 03:21.335
- WITH BOTH HANDS ON THE WHEEL.

03:21.369 --> 03:22.870
- MM-HMM.

03:22.903 --> 03:25.773
OF COURSE, UM,
WE CAN'T BE CERTAIN

03:25.806 --> 03:26.974
THAT EVEN WITHIN A MONTH
OR A YEAR

03:27.007 --> 03:28.609
THAT THE CANCER
WON'T REOCCUR.

03:28.642 --> 03:31.379
BUT THE, UH, SONOGRAM
AND THE BLOOD TESTS

03:31.412 --> 03:33.614
SHOW NO SIGNS OF SPREADING.

03:33.647 --> 03:35.716
- HOW LONG TILL
I CAN RESUME A NORMAL LIFE,

03:35.749 --> 03:37.017
DOING RECREATIONAL DRUGS

03:37.050 --> 03:39.887
AND CONSUMING VAST AMOUNTS
OF ALCOHOL?

03:39.920 --> 03:41.722
GOING TO THE GYM?

03:41.755 --> 03:43.491
- I DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM
WITH SOME LIGHT STRETCHING

03:43.524 --> 03:44.858
AND MILD CARDIO.

03:44.892 --> 03:46.994
- DOC, I'M A FAG.

03:47.027 --> 03:48.862
I DON'T GO TO THE GYM
TO BE HEALTHY.

03:48.896 --> 03:50.598
I GO THERE TO LOOK GOOD.

03:50.631 --> 03:53.033
LIGHT STRETCHING AND MILD CARDIO
AREN'T GOING TO CUT IT.

03:53.066 --> 03:55.002
- BRIAN, YOU'VE HAD CANCER.

03:55.035 --> 03:58.272
YOUR BODY'S BEEN THROUGH A
SERIES OF RADIATION TREATMENTS.

03:58.306 --> 04:01.875
I SUGGEST YOU TAKE IT EASY,
GIVE YOURSELF TIME TO RECOVER.

04:01.909 --> 04:04.645
AFTER ALL, YOU'RE, UH,
NOT 21 ANYMORE.

04:09.850 --> 04:12.019
- THIS IS
A FUCKING CATASTROPHE.

04:12.052 --> 04:14.388
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED
TO JEFFREY PENDERGRASS?

04:14.422 --> 04:16.490
- HE FELT
HE DIDN'T HAVE THE SUPPORT

04:16.524 --> 04:19.427
OF CERTAIN INFLUENTIAL MEMBERS
OF THE COMMUNITY

04:19.460 --> 04:21.028
AND THAT,
WITHOUT THEIR BACKING,

04:21.061 --> 04:23.364
HE COULDN'T SUCCESSFULLY
MEET THE GOALS.

04:23.397 --> 04:24.832
- SO HE TOOK OFF,

04:24.865 --> 04:26.834
WITH PRACTICALLY EVERY CENT
WE MANAGED TO RAISE.

04:26.867 --> 04:28.369
- BASTARD!
- WE AGREED TO PAY

04:28.402 --> 04:29.537
ALL HIS EXPENSES.

04:29.570 --> 04:31.772
- INCLUDING HOTEL SUITE,
CHAMPAGNE,

04:31.805 --> 04:33.574
AND THE KICK-OFF PARTY
AT BABYLON?

04:33.607 --> 04:35.409
- WHICH IT BARELY MANAGED
TO COVER, ACCORDING TO HIM.

04:35.443 --> 04:38.979
- UGH, I GUESS BRIAN
HAD HIS NUMBER ALL ALONG.

04:39.012 --> 04:40.448
- OKAY, SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

04:40.481 --> 04:42.650
- THERE'S ONLY ONE THING
WE CAN DO--

04:42.683 --> 04:45.786
CANCEL THE LIBERTY RIDE,
REFUND EVERYONE'S MONEY.

04:45.819 --> 04:47.721
- HOW CAN YOU REFUND IT
IF YOU HAVEN'T GOT IT?

04:47.755 --> 04:49.957
- HOW MUCH ARE WE IN THE HOLE?

04:49.990 --> 04:52.660
- ALMOST $25,000.

04:52.693 --> 04:55.863
[all groan]

04:55.896 --> 04:57.665
- CONGRATULATIONS,
EVERYONE,

04:57.698 --> 05:00.368
ON BEING THE FIRST CHARITY RIDE
TO PEDAL BACKWARDS.

05:00.401 --> 05:01.935
- LOOK, LIBERTY HOUSE
IS DEPENDING ON US.

05:01.969 --> 05:04.004
WITHOUT THIS RIDE, THEY'LL BE
FORCED TO CLOSE THEIR DOORS.

05:04.037 --> 05:07.741
- THEN WE HAVE NO CHOICE
BUT TO GO AHEAD WITH IT.

05:07.775 --> 05:11.612
- AND HOPE THAT WE FIND
MORE PLEDGES AND SPONSORS.

05:13.981 --> 05:16.417
- IT'S AWFULLY SWEET OF YOU,
TEDDY, TO TAKE ME TO LUNCH.

05:16.450 --> 05:18.552
- WELL, I FIGURED YOU COULD USE
SOME CHEERING UP.

05:18.586 --> 05:21.455
- I HAVE TO ADMIT,
IT HASN'T BEEN EASY.

05:21.489 --> 05:23.557
AFTER ALL,
HOW MANY TIMES IN LIFE

05:23.591 --> 05:25.626
DO YOU GET TO LIVE OUT
A FANTASY?

05:25.659 --> 05:28.829
YOU KNOW,
HAVE A SECRET AFFAIR

05:28.862 --> 05:32.366
WITH A FAMOUS FOOTBALL STAR,

05:32.400 --> 05:35.436
HAVE HIM RIDE YOUR BACK END
THREE TIMES A WEEK

05:35.469 --> 05:37.971
WITH HIS ROCK-HARD,
10-INCH BATTERING RAM

05:38.005 --> 05:42.743
UNTIL YOUR SCREAMS OF ECSTASY
FILL AN ENTIRE STADIUM?

05:42.776 --> 05:44.845
TO LIE THERE SPENT,

05:44.878 --> 05:48.115
EXHAUSTED, INSENSATE?

05:48.148 --> 05:50.451
AND THAT'S ONLY HALFTIME.
[chuckles]

05:50.484 --> 05:53.387
- NOT OFTEN.
SO WHAT ARE YOU IN THE MOOD FOR?

05:53.421 --> 05:55.389
- I COULD DO
WITH A CHINESE CHICKEN SALAD...

05:55.423 --> 05:58.992
AND WITHOUT ANY MORE TALK
OF DREW BOYD.

05:59.026 --> 06:00.561
- [sighs]

06:00.594 --> 06:02.129
IN THAT CASE,

06:02.162 --> 06:05.766
YOU MAY WANT TO AVOID
MAJOR THOROUGHFARES.

06:09.102 --> 06:11.605
ALL FORMS
OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION,

06:11.639 --> 06:14.608
BETTER SHOPS
AND DEPARTMENT STORES.

06:14.642 --> 06:16.510
I'D ALSO STAY AWAY
FROM PUBLICATIONS

06:16.544 --> 06:20.013
SUCH AS NEWSPAPERS
AND MAGAZINES FOR, UH...

06:20.047 --> 06:22.616
OH, UH, A YEAR OR SO.

06:22.650 --> 06:27.421
AND, UH, DON'T LOOK UP.

06:27.455 --> 06:30.023
- [sighs]

06:30.057 --> 06:34.795
[whining]
GOUGE MY EYES OUT NOW.

06:34.828 --> 06:37.465
- POOR THING.

06:41.569 --> 06:45.573
[indistinct chatter]

06:45.606 --> 06:48.676
- YOU LOOK
ABSOLUTELY RADIANT, MEL.

06:48.709 --> 06:50.511
- LIKE A BOTTICELLI MADONNA.

06:50.544 --> 06:52.913
- I WAS THINKING MORE LIKE
A RINGLING BROTHERS ELEPHANT.

06:52.946 --> 06:56.183
- THIS MUST BE THE HAPPIEST TIME
OF YOUR LIFE.

06:56.216 --> 06:57.518
- MUST BE.

06:57.551 --> 06:59.520
- HI, EVERYONE.

06:59.553 --> 07:01.188
- HEY, LINDSAY.

07:01.221 --> 07:04.692
- SORRY I'M LATE.
- LAST-MINUTE AUERBACH SALE?

07:04.725 --> 07:06.660
- YOU WANT SOME FRUIT PUNCH?

07:06.694 --> 07:09.863
I'VE ALSO GOT GINGER ALE
OR VANILLA SOY DRINK.

07:09.897 --> 07:11.532
- I WISH THEY'D LOWER
THE DRINKING AGE TO FIVE.

07:11.565 --> 07:12.933
I COULD SURE USE A SCOTCH.

07:12.966 --> 07:14.802
- CONGRATULATIONS ON THE SHOW
AT THE GALLERY.

07:14.835 --> 07:16.937
- HEY, IT'S BEEN ALL OVER
THE PAPERS.

07:16.970 --> 07:18.539
- THAT MUST'VE BEEN
A REAL THRILL,

07:18.572 --> 07:20.941
WORKING WITH A FAMOUS ARTIST
LIKE SAM AUERBACH.

07:20.974 --> 07:23.076
- YOU CAN'T IMAGINE
HOW ATTENTIVE SHE WAS,

07:23.110 --> 07:26.446
TENDING TO HIS EVERY NEED.

07:35.589 --> 07:37.257
- WAS THAT REMARK
REALLY NECESSARY?

07:37.290 --> 07:40.494
- HMM? WHAT REMARK?
- YOU KNOW WHAT REMARK--

07:40.528 --> 07:42.229
ABOUT MY ATTENDING
TO HIS EVERY NEED.

07:42.262 --> 07:43.964
- IT'S TRUE, ISN'T IT?

07:43.997 --> 07:46.967
IN FACT, I'M SURPRISED
YOU EVEN BOTHERED TO COME.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.136
- WHY WOULDN'T I?
- NOT A MAN IN SIGHT...

07:49.169 --> 07:50.504
JUST US DYKES.

07:50.538 --> 07:51.839
- LOOK, I TOLD YOU
HOW SORRY I AM,

07:51.872 --> 07:53.173
THAT IT WAS A MISTAKE.

07:53.206 --> 07:55.709
- ACTUALLY, YOU SAID
IT WAS A GOOD THING.

07:55.743 --> 07:57.144
- I NEVER SAID
IT WAS A GOOD THING.

07:57.177 --> 07:59.112
- THAT IT GAVE YOU A CHANCE
TO CONTRAST AND COMPARE

07:59.146 --> 08:02.115
AND COME TO THE CONCLUSION
THAT, GIVEN THE CHOICES,

08:02.149 --> 08:03.283
YOU STILL PREFER ME.

08:03.316 --> 08:04.618
- THAT PART IS TRUE.

08:04.652 --> 08:05.853
- WELL, IT ISN'T TRUE FOR ME.

08:05.886 --> 08:07.721
I KNOW WHICH TEAM I PLAY ON.

08:07.755 --> 08:09.590
IT'S NOT A CHOICE
OR A PREFERENCE.

08:09.623 --> 08:12.059
IT'S WHO I AM.
IT'S WHO I'VE ALWAYS BEEN--

08:12.092 --> 08:13.761
A RUG-MUNCHER,
A MUFF-DIVER,

08:13.794 --> 08:15.863
A CUNT-LAPPER, A BULL,
A LEZZIE, A DYKE.

08:15.896 --> 08:17.297
- WHAT DO YOU THINK I AM?

08:17.330 --> 08:18.766
- DON'T ASK ME TO MAKE UP
YOUR MIND FOR YOU.

08:18.799 --> 08:19.933
YOU HAVE TO DO THAT
ALL BY YOURSELF.

08:19.967 --> 08:21.669
- I'M A LESBIAN.

08:21.702 --> 08:23.737
- NOT IF YOU'RE HAVING SEX
WITH A MAN, HONEY...

08:23.771 --> 08:26.139
WHILE I'M PREGNANT, YET.

08:26.173 --> 08:30.510
I DON'T KNOW WHICH BETRAYAL
TO NEVER FORGIVE YOU FOR FIRST.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.150
- BAD TIMING?
- NO.

08:37.184 --> 08:39.086
WE WERE JUST HAVING
A DISCUSSION.

08:39.119 --> 08:40.287
- YOU DON'T HAVE
TO EXPLAIN IT TO ME.

08:40.320 --> 08:41.789
I'VE HAD THREE.

08:41.822 --> 08:43.023
THERE'S NOTHING
LIKE A GOOD PREGNANCY

08:43.056 --> 08:44.958
TO TURN YOU
INTO A RAVING BITCH.

08:52.666 --> 08:53.901
- THIS GUY PENDERGRASS
SKIPPED TOWN,

08:53.934 --> 08:55.335
LEAVING THE CENTER
HIGH AND DRY?

08:55.368 --> 08:56.904
- THAT'S ABOUT
THE LONG AND SHORT OF IT.

08:56.937 --> 08:59.172
- YEAH, MORE THE SHORT OF IT,
AS IN CASH.

08:59.206 --> 09:01.108
- I WONDER WHAT HAPPENED.

09:01.141 --> 09:02.910
- WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING
AT ME FOR?

09:02.943 --> 09:04.177
- IT DOESN'T MATTER--
WE'RE STILL GOING TO TRAIN,

09:04.211 --> 09:06.079
AND WE'RE STILL
GOING TO RIDE.

09:06.113 --> 09:07.848
- YOU COMING IN WITH US?

09:07.881 --> 09:09.983
- OH, BRIAN'S DOCTOR CAUTIONED
HIM TO TAKE IT EASY.

09:10.017 --> 09:11.318
- MEANING WHAT--

09:11.351 --> 09:13.921
GETTING LAID THREE TIMES A WEEK
INSTEAD OF FOUR?

09:13.954 --> 09:15.656
- MORE LIKE SEVEN
INSTEAD OF NINE.

09:15.689 --> 09:17.057
- YEAH, SOME RECUPERATION.

09:17.090 --> 09:18.959
- TOO BAD
YOU CAN'T GO WITH US.

09:18.992 --> 09:20.728
- EVEN IF HE WAS
IN PEAK CONDITION,

09:20.761 --> 09:23.931
I DOUBT BRIAN WOULD BE DONATING
HIS BACKSIDE FOR CHARITY.

09:23.964 --> 09:25.799
- IT'S NOT JUST A CHARITY.

09:25.833 --> 09:27.935
WE ALL KNOW SOMEONE,
OR AT LEAST HEARD OF SOMEONE,

09:27.968 --> 09:30.070
WHO SPENT HIS LAST DAYS
AT LIBERTY HOUSE.

09:30.103 --> 09:32.940
SOMEDAY IT MIGHT BE ONE OF US.

09:32.973 --> 09:34.675
- NOT AS LONG AS I'M AROUND.

09:34.708 --> 09:37.210
- THE POINT IS, WE ALL DESERVE
TO DIE WITH DIGNITY

09:37.244 --> 09:39.212
AND A FRIEND BY OUR SIDE.

09:39.246 --> 09:41.081
- I'M SURE EVEN BRIAN
WOULD AGREE WITH THAT.

09:41.114 --> 09:42.249
- HMM.

09:45.653 --> 09:47.721
- SEE YA.
- BYE, BRIAN.

09:47.755 --> 09:49.089
- SEE YA.

09:49.122 --> 09:51.258
- [clears throat]

09:53.193 --> 09:56.296
- WHAT'S UP?

09:56.329 --> 09:59.833
- THIS BIG, BLACK S.U.V.
HAS BEEN CIRCLING THE BLOCK.

09:59.867 --> 10:02.269
IT KEEPS STOPPING
IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE.

10:02.302 --> 10:03.971
CHRIST, NOW IT'S PARKING.

10:04.004 --> 10:07.374
- SO?
- WELL, I DON'T LIKE IT.

10:07.407 --> 10:11.144
I DON'T LIKE IT AT ALL.

10:11.178 --> 10:14.882
YOU DON'T SUPPOSE VIC
HAD A SECRET LIFE, DO YOU?

10:14.915 --> 10:16.383
YOU KNOW, LIKE,
MAYBE HE WORKED FOR THE CIA

10:16.416 --> 10:19.119
OR THE MAFIA
OR SOME FOREIGN GOVERNMENT,

10:19.152 --> 10:22.155
AND NOW THAT HE'S GONE,
THEY DECIDED TO RUB US OUT?

10:25.158 --> 10:27.895
- NO.

10:27.928 --> 10:31.198
- WELL, I HAVE TO GO TO WORK,
AND I'M AFRAID TO GO OUT THERE.

10:31.231 --> 10:34.301
- YOU USE THE BACK WAY.
I'LL DISTRACT THEM.

10:34.334 --> 10:36.436
- GOOD IDEA.

10:36.469 --> 10:40.974
- BUT I'M TELLING CARL
ABOUT THIS, JUST IN CASE.

11:11.004 --> 11:12.973
- IF YOU'RE PLANNING
TO ACCOST ME,

11:13.006 --> 11:15.776
YOU SHOULD KNOW, THEY DON'T
CALL US SCREAMING FAGGOTS

11:15.809 --> 11:17.177
FOR NOTHING.

11:17.210 --> 11:18.946
AND IF YOU'RE HOPING TO SCORE,

11:18.979 --> 11:21.081
YOU'RE GOING ABOUT IT
ALL WRONG.

11:24.818 --> 11:27.855
- GET IN.

11:27.888 --> 11:30.223
- I DON'T ACCEPT RIDES
FROM STRANGERS...

11:30.257 --> 11:31.959
PARTICULARLY THOSE
WHO DON'T SHOW UP

11:31.992 --> 11:33.360
OR AT LEAST CALL.

11:33.393 --> 11:36.163
- GET IN.

11:49.176 --> 11:51.378
- NICE OIL TANKER.

11:51.411 --> 11:54.114
SO WHAT BRINGS YOU
TO QUEERSVILLE?

11:54.147 --> 11:56.349
- MY GAME'S BEEN SHIT.
- MM? TALK TO YOUR COACH.

11:56.383 --> 11:57.951
- I CAN'T SLEEP.
- TAKE A XANAX.

11:57.985 --> 12:00.854
- I'M DRINKING TOO MUCH.
- BUY MORE BEER NUTS.

12:03.190 --> 12:05.759
- I MISS YOU.

12:07.394 --> 12:10.263
- YOU DO?

12:13.934 --> 12:15.769
- CAN WE GO TO THE MOTEL?

12:15.803 --> 12:18.839
- YEAH.

12:18.872 --> 12:20.841
UM...NO.

12:20.874 --> 12:24.044
NO, I-I CAN'T GO BACK THERE.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.512
- I THOUGHT YOU LOVE
WHEN I FUCK YOU.

12:25.545 --> 12:28.548
- I DO LOVE
WHEN YOU FUCK ME.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.250
THIS ISN'T THE ATKINS DIET.

12:30.283 --> 12:32.986
YOU KNOW, MAN CAN'T LIVE
ON MEAT ALONE...

12:33.020 --> 12:36.289
AT LEAST THIS MAN CAN'T.

12:42.595 --> 12:45.298
- ALL RIGHT, WE'LL GO OUT.

12:47.200 --> 12:50.303
- YOU MEAN IT?

12:55.075 --> 12:56.409
CAREFUL.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.311
WHAT IF SOMEBODY SEES US?

12:58.345 --> 13:00.981
- THEY CAN'T.

13:01.014 --> 13:03.183
[knocks on window]

13:03.216 --> 13:05.552
REMEMBER?

13:05.585 --> 13:08.455
- [chuckles]

13:18.331 --> 13:22.335
[moaning]

13:24.938 --> 13:28.441
- YOU HAVE NICE LIPS,
REALLY SOFT.

13:28.475 --> 13:32.245
- THANKS. YOU TOO.

13:32.279 --> 13:34.581
- THEY'RE THE FIRST THING
I NOTICED ABOUT YOU.

13:34.614 --> 13:37.117
- YEAH?
- YEAH.

13:37.150 --> 13:39.052
WHAT WAS THE FIRST THING
YOU NOTICED ABOUT ME?

13:39.086 --> 13:42.055
- HMM...YOUR NOSE.
[laughs]

13:42.089 --> 13:45.025
- YOU LIAR.

13:48.996 --> 13:51.965
THESE.

14:02.442 --> 14:06.213
- DID I ALSO MENTION
YOU HAVE A REALLY CUTE ASS?

14:06.246 --> 14:09.149
[both laughing]

14:30.437 --> 14:32.105
DO YOU HAVE A CONDOM?

14:32.139 --> 14:35.108
- HUH?
- A CONDOM.

14:35.142 --> 14:36.509
- I KNOW WHAT IT IS.

14:36.543 --> 14:37.978
- WELL, IF YOU DON'T,
I APPROPRIATED SOME

14:38.011 --> 14:40.948
FROM MY BROTHER.

14:42.715 --> 14:43.984
- YOU REALLY WANT TO?

14:44.017 --> 14:47.520
- WELL, DON'T YOU?

14:47.554 --> 14:50.991
- SURE.

14:51.024 --> 14:53.994
IT'S JUST THAT...

14:54.027 --> 14:57.197
BEFORE WE DO...

14:57.230 --> 15:01.001
THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU SHOULD KNOW.

15:02.702 --> 15:06.273
I'M POSITIVE.

15:06.306 --> 15:09.142
- POSITIVE?

15:09.176 --> 15:10.210
YOU MEAN...

15:10.243 --> 15:13.013
- I HAVE H.I.V.

15:13.046 --> 15:15.682
- SHIT.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

15:15.715 --> 15:18.185
- I'M NOT SICK OR ANYTHING.

15:18.218 --> 15:20.287
IT'S JUST...

15:20.320 --> 15:22.555
THERE...

15:22.589 --> 15:25.558
INSIDE ME.

15:25.592 --> 15:29.096
- HOW DID YOU GET IT?

15:29.129 --> 15:33.466
WAS IT A TRANSFUSION
OR FROM DOING DRUGS?

15:37.204 --> 15:39.639
- IT'S OKAY.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME.

15:39.672 --> 15:42.742
DOES ANYONE ELSE
AT SCHOOL KNOW?

15:42.775 --> 15:45.112
- UH, NO.

15:45.145 --> 15:49.316
- I PROMISE
I WON'T TELL ANYONE.

15:49.349 --> 15:51.384
I'M SORRY.

15:51.418 --> 15:55.088
- YEAH.

15:55.122 --> 15:58.491
I GUESS I BETTER GO.

16:04.097 --> 16:07.634
- WAIT.

16:07.667 --> 16:10.637
MY PARENTS WON'T BE HOME
FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS.

16:10.670 --> 16:14.341
- BUT I THOUGHT--
- WELL...

16:14.374 --> 16:17.144
WE HAVE THESE, DON'T WE?

16:17.177 --> 16:21.114
AS LONG AS WE USE ONE,
THEN IT'S SAFE, RIGHT?

16:49.409 --> 16:51.511
- [sighs]

16:51.544 --> 16:53.113
I THOUGHT WE AGREED
YOU WERE GOING TO AVOID

16:53.146 --> 16:56.516
ALL MAJOR THOROUGHFARES,
STORES, AND PUBLICATIONS.

16:56.549 --> 16:58.318
- I KNOW.
- YOU HAVE TO BE STRONG, EM.

16:58.351 --> 16:59.786
OKAY?
SITTING HERE, PINING AWAY,

16:59.819 --> 17:01.788
SIPPING ICE CREAM SODAS
IS NO SOLUTION.

17:01.821 --> 17:04.157
YOU NEED TO SHIFT YOUR FOCUS.

17:04.191 --> 17:06.293
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

17:10.563 --> 17:13.266
- GOD, I WISH THERE WAS A
MEETING YOU COULD GO TO TONIGHT.

17:13.300 --> 17:15.602
- WELL, I CAN'T.

17:15.635 --> 17:17.270
DREW'S TAKING ME OUT...

17:17.304 --> 17:19.072
ON A REAL DATE.

17:19.106 --> 17:20.540
I'M FINALLY GOING TO SEE
SOMETHING BESIDES THE CEILING

17:20.573 --> 17:23.843
OF ROOM 12
AT THE HACIENDA MOTEL.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.578
- I THOUGHT YOU AND HE
BROKE UP.

17:25.612 --> 17:27.747
- HE MISSED ME.

17:27.780 --> 17:29.816
ISN'T THAT AMAZING?

17:29.849 --> 17:33.086
THIS MAN, WHO ONLY DAYS AGO
WAS IN THE CLOSET

17:33.120 --> 17:34.721
DEEPER THAN
A LIME-GREEN LEISURE SUIT,

17:34.754 --> 17:39.592
HAS DECIDED TO GO OUT
BECAUSE, UM...

17:39.626 --> 17:42.462
BECAUSE OF ME.

17:42.495 --> 17:44.364
WELL...

17:44.397 --> 17:46.199
I BETTER GET READY.

17:46.233 --> 17:49.369
I'M GOING TO GET A MANICURE
AND A FACIAL.

17:49.402 --> 17:50.570
AND WHO KNOWS?

17:50.603 --> 17:53.106
AFTER, UH,
PAINTING THE TOWN MAUVE,

17:53.140 --> 17:55.175
WE MIGHT JUST END UP
AT BABYLON.

17:55.208 --> 17:57.177
[chuckles]

17:57.210 --> 18:00.347
BYE, MEL.
- OH.

18:09.222 --> 18:11.324
- YOU PLANNING ON HAVING
THAT BABY HERE?

18:11.358 --> 18:13.126
- HUH?

18:13.160 --> 18:15.195
- YOU'VE BEEN SITTING THERE
SINCE BREAKFAST.

18:15.228 --> 18:17.330
HERE'S LUNCH.

18:17.364 --> 18:21.201
- OH, I DIDN'T ORDER THIS.
- I KNOW.

18:21.234 --> 18:25.138
I'M JUST PRACTICING BEING
A LOVING, ATTENTIVE GRANDMA.

18:25.172 --> 18:26.506
- THANKS, DEB.

18:31.178 --> 18:32.379
- NOW I'M GOING TO PRACTICE

18:32.412 --> 18:36.216
BEING A NOSY,
MEDDLESOME GRANDMA.

18:36.249 --> 18:39.819
SOMETHING WRONG, HONEY?
- NO, IT'S NOTHING.

18:39.852 --> 18:43.390
- NOT WITH A PUNIM LIKE THAT.
- HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT WORD?

18:43.423 --> 18:45.425
- YOU LIVE LONG ENOUGH,
EVERYBODY'S JEWISH.

18:50.563 --> 18:52.232
NOTHING'S WRONG
WITH THAT BABY?

18:52.265 --> 18:54.367
- THE BABY'S OKAY.
I'M OKAY.

18:54.401 --> 18:57.270
IT'S NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT.

19:00.673 --> 19:03.643
IT'S LINDSAY AND ME.

19:03.676 --> 19:05.912
WE'RE IN TROUBLE, DEB,
REAL TROUBLE.

19:05.945 --> 19:10.450
- STOP RIGHT THERE.
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW...

19:10.483 --> 19:14.287
'CAUSE WHATEVER IT IS,
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

19:14.321 --> 19:18.525
WHAT MATTERS IS,
YOU'RE ABOUT TO HAVE A BABY.

19:18.558 --> 19:21.194
AND THAT'S ALL THAT COUNTS.

19:21.228 --> 19:24.264
SO IT'S UP TO YOU
TO MAKE THINGS WORK.

19:24.297 --> 19:26.733
SO YOU JUST CHEW ON THAT,

19:26.766 --> 19:28.668
ALONG WITH YOUR CHICKEN SALAD,

19:28.701 --> 19:32.171
WHILE I GRAB YOU A PIECE
OF KEY LIME.

19:35.908 --> 19:38.845
- [sighs]

19:41.848 --> 19:45.485
- AS I SAID, MR. REMSON,
WE'RE A MODEST FACILITY,

19:45.518 --> 19:46.886
TENDING TO THE FINAL NEEDS

19:46.919 --> 19:50.290
OF THOSE FOR WHOM MEDICATIONS
SUCH AS ENDOVIR

19:50.323 --> 19:53.293
HAVE PROVED INEFFECTIVE
OR SIMPLY TOO LATE.

19:53.326 --> 19:56.429
I COUNT MYSELF
AMONG THE FORTUNATE ONES.

19:56.463 --> 19:58.431
- YOU'RE DOING
A HELL OF A JOB HERE.

19:58.465 --> 19:59.866
I'M SURE IT'S NOT EASY.

19:59.899 --> 20:02.602
- THE HARDEST PART
IS NOT BEING ABLE TO DO MORE.

20:02.635 --> 20:05.338
WE'VE ALREADY HAD TO SEND
A COUPLE OF OUR SICKEST CLIENTS

20:05.372 --> 20:06.906
TO THE COUNTY HOSPITAL

20:06.939 --> 20:08.841
SIMPLY BECAUSE WE NO LONGER
HAVE THE STAFF

20:08.875 --> 20:11.644
OR CAPABILITY OF TENDING
TO THEIR NEEDS.

20:11.678 --> 20:13.980
- IT'S A SHAME.
- IT'S MONEY.

20:14.013 --> 20:16.383
STATE FUNDING
HAS BEEN REDUCED.

20:16.416 --> 20:18.785
PRIVATE DONATIONS
HAVE ALL BUT DRIED UP,

20:18.818 --> 20:19.852
DUE TO THE MISCONCEPTION

20:19.886 --> 20:22.322
THAT NO ONE DIES OF AIDS
ANYMORE.

20:22.355 --> 20:25.858
- WELL, I HOPE YOU MANAGE
TO FIND THE NECESSARY FUNDS.

20:25.892 --> 20:28.595
- IT MAY BE TOO LATE FOR THAT.

20:28.628 --> 20:31.998
LIKE OUR CLIENTS,
WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

20:32.031 --> 20:34.601
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I HAVE TO GO BACK TO WORK.

20:34.634 --> 20:37.570
THERE ARE ONLY TWO OF US.

20:42.375 --> 20:44.677
- I SUPPOSE YOU'RE GOING
TO HIT ME UP NOW.

20:44.711 --> 20:46.346
AND AFTER WHAT
I'VE JUST SEEN,

20:46.379 --> 20:48.415
IT'S GOING TO BE VERY HARD
TO SAY NO.

20:48.448 --> 20:51.484
- IT'S A WORTHY CAUSE.
- THEY'RE ALL WORTHY CAUSES.

20:51.518 --> 20:53.353
- ALL I'M ASKING
IS FOR YOU TO SPONSOR

20:53.386 --> 20:55.021
ONE RIDER
IN THE LIBERTY RIDE.

20:55.054 --> 20:57.023
- THAT'S IT?
- THAT'S IT.

20:57.056 --> 20:59.392
- WELL, I SUPPOSE
WE CAN HANDLE THAT.

20:59.426 --> 21:01.894
- HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT?
- $100,000.

21:01.928 --> 21:04.531
LOOK, IT'S NO MORE THAN YOU'D
SPEND FOR AN AD IN A MAGAZINE,

21:04.564 --> 21:06.799
AND THINK OF THE GOODWILL
YOU'LL BE GENERATING.

21:06.833 --> 21:09.569
IT'S MORE THAN ANY CAMPAIGN
THAT I COULD COME UP WITH.

21:09.602 --> 21:11.638
AS FOR THE RIDER
YOU'LL BE SPONSORING,

21:11.671 --> 21:15.675
HE'S AN AMAZING ATHLETE
AND A RENOWNED HUMANITARIAN.

21:19.446 --> 21:22.382
- WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING--
BRAIN SURGERY?

21:22.415 --> 21:24.784
- FAR MORE DELICATE.

21:24.817 --> 21:28.521
THIS IS A VERY RARE COMIC
FROM THE '50s.

21:28.555 --> 21:31.658
AND YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO LET
THE ACID FROM YOUR FINGERS

21:31.691 --> 21:35.061
TOUCH THE PAPER.

21:35.094 --> 21:36.663
THERE.

21:36.696 --> 21:38.665
THE OPERATION IS A SUCCESS.

21:38.698 --> 21:42.335
MICHAEL NOVOTNY, DOCTOR
OF COMICOLOGY, TRIUMPHS AGAIN.

21:42.369 --> 21:43.703
- FREAK SHOW.

21:43.736 --> 21:45.938
[phone rings]
- WOULD YOU GET THAT?

21:45.972 --> 21:49.342
AND TELL WHOEVER IT IS
THAT THE DOCTOR IS IN.

21:49.376 --> 21:52.078
[phone rings]

21:52.111 --> 21:54.080
- HELLO?

21:54.113 --> 21:56.549
UH, SURE.
HOLD ON.

21:56.583 --> 21:58.685
IT'S MR. LEESON...

21:58.718 --> 21:59.952
CALLIE'S DAD.

21:59.986 --> 22:01.921
- OH.

22:03.856 --> 22:05.558
STEVE? HI.

22:05.592 --> 22:07.827
IT WAS NICE MEETING YOU
AND AMBER THE OTHER NIGHT.

22:07.860 --> 22:10.963
BEN AND I ARE REALLY LOOKING
FORWARD TO GETTING TOGETHER.

22:10.997 --> 22:12.365
TONIGHT?

22:12.399 --> 22:13.566
WELL, I'LL HAVE TO CHECK
WITH BEN,

22:13.600 --> 22:14.601
BUT I'M SURE IT'LL BE OKAY.

22:14.634 --> 22:17.737
WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE TO MEET?

22:17.770 --> 22:21.708
THAT'D BE FINE.
HOW ABOUT 8:00?

22:21.741 --> 22:23.710
SEE YOU THEN.

22:23.743 --> 22:24.977
- WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

22:25.011 --> 22:26.479
- WE'D BETTER GO HOME
AND DUST.

22:26.513 --> 22:29.482
YOUR IN-LAWS-TO-BE
ARE COMING OVER.

22:29.516 --> 22:31.984
[techno music]

22:32.018 --> 22:34.721
- * I'M GONNA TAKE YOU

22:34.754 --> 22:35.855

* TAKE YOU TO THE TOWER

22:43.195 --> 22:45.732
* YOU'LL BE A GOD

22:45.765 --> 22:47.400
* A GOD LIKE AN ANCIENT GREEK

22:47.434 --> 22:49.602
* I'M GONNA TAKE YOU
OVER THE MOUNTAIN *

22:49.636 --> 22:51.003
* TAKE YOU OVER THE MOUNTAIN

23:10.523 --> 23:14.894
[both grunting, gasping]

23:14.927 --> 23:18.498
- OF ALL THE TIMES
WE'VE FUCKED...

23:18.531 --> 23:19.766
AND BY NOW,
I'D SAY THAT WE WERE

23:19.799 --> 23:22.569
WELL INTO
THE QUADRUPLE DIGITS...

23:22.602 --> 23:24.036
[groans]

23:24.070 --> 23:27.540
THAT HAS TO RANK
IN THE TOP FIVE.

23:27.574 --> 23:31.110
- GOOD.
THAT'LL BE $1,000, PLEASE.

23:31.143 --> 23:34.180
- THAT'S QUITE AN INCREASE
FROM THE TWO BITS

23:34.213 --> 23:36.916
YOU WERE CHARGING
WHEN WE MET.

23:36.949 --> 23:39.786
- TO EXPERIENCE PERFECTION
IS A PRIVILEGE

23:39.819 --> 23:41.954
REGARDLESS OF THE PRICE.

23:41.988 --> 23:44.791
- BESIDES, I NEED YOU TO SPONSOR
ME FOR THE LIBERTY RIDE.

23:44.824 --> 23:46.092
- I'M SORRY, SUNSHINE.

23:46.125 --> 23:48.561
I'M ALREADY SPONSORING
SOMEONE ELSE.

23:48.595 --> 23:49.996
ME.

23:50.029 --> 23:51.831
- WHAT?

23:51.864 --> 23:53.833
- I'M DOING THE RIDE.

23:53.866 --> 23:55.935
- YOU CAN'T DO THE RIDE.

23:55.968 --> 23:57.937
YOU'VE BARELY RECOVERED.

23:57.970 --> 24:01.107
THE DOCTOR TOLD YOU TO TAKE IT
EASY, AND AT YOUR AGE--

24:01.140 --> 24:05.845
- AT MY AGE,
I CAN MAKE UP MY OWN MIND.

24:05.878 --> 24:09.616
- YOU HATE BICYCLING.
YOU DESPISE CAMPING OUT.

24:09.649 --> 24:11.718
YOU DETEST
ANY AND ALL FORMS OF CHARITY.

24:11.751 --> 24:13.119
YOU LOATHE
THE GAY AND LESBIAN CENTER

24:13.152 --> 24:15.555
AND EVERYONE
ASSOCIATED WITH IT.

24:15.588 --> 24:18.591
SO GIVE ME ONE--
JUST ONE GOOD REASON WHY.

24:18.625 --> 24:21.260
- I WANT TO.

24:21.293 --> 24:25.698
- WELL, YOU CAN'T.

24:25.732 --> 24:28.601
YOU HAVEN'T TRAINED.
YOU'RE NOT IN SHAPE.

24:28.635 --> 24:29.969
THERE'S NO WAY YOU'D MAKE IT
OUT OF TORONTO,

24:30.002 --> 24:33.105
MUCH LESS THE 322 MILES
BACK TO PITTSBURGH.

24:33.139 --> 24:36.576
- YOUR PROPHECIES OF DOOM
ONLY INCITE ME MORE.

24:36.609 --> 24:37.910
- I'M JUST BEING REALISTIC.

24:37.944 --> 24:41.147
- WELL, WE DREAMERS
HAVE NO TIME FOR THAT.

24:43.883 --> 24:46.252
WHEN'S THE NEXT SPIN CLASS?
- TOMORROW.

24:46.285 --> 24:48.020
- HMM.

24:48.054 --> 24:50.256
WITH A LITTLE PRACTICE,

24:50.289 --> 24:52.892
I'LL FLY LIKE THE WIND.

24:54.894 --> 24:56.863
- UGH.

24:56.896 --> 24:59.799
- [clears throat]

25:04.236 --> 25:07.607
THE SALMON WAS DELICIOUS.

25:07.640 --> 25:09.075
- THANKS.

25:09.108 --> 25:11.778
I TRIED TO COOK IT THE WAY
YOU LIKE, ALMOST RARE.

25:11.811 --> 25:14.313
WOULD YOU LIKE SOME MORE?
- NO, THANKS.

25:14.346 --> 25:15.782
- HERE, LET ME.
- NO, NO, NO.

25:15.815 --> 25:18.651
YOU COOKED, I'LL CLEAN UP.

25:20.086 --> 25:22.789
THE PREMIUM FOR
THE VARIABLE ANNUITY ARRIVED,

25:22.822 --> 25:25.224
WE BOTH HAVE TO WRITE CHECKS.

25:25.257 --> 25:27.159
AND THE TERMITE INSPECTOR'S
COMING TOMORROW.

25:27.193 --> 25:29.161
- IT NEVER STOPS, DOES IT?
- WHAT?

25:29.195 --> 25:30.963
- THE HOUSE,
KEEPING THINGS IN ORDER.

25:30.997 --> 25:32.832
IF IT ISN'T ONE THING,
IT'S ANOTHER.

25:32.865 --> 25:35.334
- WE DON'T WANT
THE FOUNDATION TO ROT.

25:35.367 --> 25:36.769
- NO, WE DON'T.

25:36.803 --> 25:39.639
- THEN WE HAVE
TO TAKE CARE OF IT.

25:39.672 --> 25:42.575
AFTER ALL, IT'S OUR HOME.

25:45.111 --> 25:47.179
SUSANNAH CALLED,

25:47.213 --> 25:50.717
ABOUT THOSE TICKETS
TO THE EVGENY KISSIN RECITAL.

25:50.750 --> 25:52.218
SHE WANTED TO KNOW IF WE'RE
STILL PLANNING ON GOING

25:52.251 --> 25:53.586
WITH HER AND TESS.

25:53.620 --> 25:54.721
I SAID, OF COURSE.

25:54.754 --> 25:57.690
- OH, MEL.

25:58.991 --> 26:00.927
- [sighs]

26:00.960 --> 26:02.729
JUST STOP IT.

26:02.762 --> 26:05.131
STOP IT!

26:05.164 --> 26:08.067
- WHAT?

26:08.100 --> 26:10.336
I JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU
A HUG AND A KISS.

26:10.369 --> 26:14.607
- WELL, I DON'T WANT YOU
GIVING ME A HUG OR A KISS.

26:14.641 --> 26:16.709
BUT I THOUGHT--
I MEAN...

26:16.743 --> 26:18.344
THAT EVERYTHING
WAS GOING TO BE OKAY.

26:18.377 --> 26:21.814
- HOW COULD EVERYTHING
BE OKAY?

26:21.848 --> 26:23.950
I'M JUST TRYING TO MAINTAIN
SOME SENSE OF ORDER,

26:23.983 --> 26:26.919
JUST HOLD THINGS TOGETHER.

26:29.188 --> 26:32.959
- I SEE.

26:32.992 --> 26:36.228
I ACTUALLY THOUGHT
YOU DECIDED TO FORGIVE ME.

26:36.262 --> 26:39.732
- YOU MUST EXPECT MIRACLES
OR AMNESIA.

26:39.766 --> 26:41.834
WELL, I'M SORRY I CAN'T
GIVE YOU WHAT YOU WANT.

26:41.868 --> 26:44.003
BUT THAT'S PAR
FOR THE COURSE, ISN'T IT?

26:44.036 --> 26:45.872
- WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

26:45.905 --> 26:48.741
- THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO

26:48.775 --> 26:51.911
THAT'LL EVER MAKE YOU
FEEL COMPLETELY HAPPY.

26:51.944 --> 26:53.412
YOU'LL ALWAYS
FEEL UNSATISFIED,

26:53.445 --> 26:55.047
AND I'LL ALWAYS
FEEL LIKE I'M NOT ENOUGH.

26:55.081 --> 26:56.716
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.

26:56.749 --> 26:58.117
- OH, BULLSHIT!
OF COURSE IT IS.

26:58.150 --> 26:59.986
OTHERWISE, NONE OF THIS
WOULD'VE HAPPENED.

27:00.019 --> 27:03.723
- MEL!
[sighs]

27:03.756 --> 27:07.193
- OOH!
- MEL?

27:07.226 --> 27:09.395
ARE YOU OKAY?

27:09.428 --> 27:12.164
- SOMETHING FEELS WRONG.
- OH, GOD.

27:12.198 --> 27:15.167
[dance music]

27:15.201 --> 27:23.175
*

27:31.050 --> 27:32.785
- DUDE, THAT IS TOTALLY
DREW BOYD.

27:32.819 --> 27:34.754
OH, MY GOD.

27:34.787 --> 27:36.188
- * HAIL TO THE KING

27:36.222 --> 27:38.190
[overlapping exclamations]

27:38.224 --> 27:41.694
* HAIL TO THE KING

27:41.728 --> 27:45.765
* HAIL TO THE KING

27:45.798 --> 27:48.034
* HAIL TO THE KING
- * THERE'S ONLY ONE KING

27:48.067 --> 27:53.205
* COME ON AND BE MY QUEEN
- * HAIL TO THE KING

27:53.239 --> 27:55.441
- * THERE'S ONLY ONE KING
- * HAIL TO THE KING

27:55.474 --> 28:00.446
- * COME ON AND BE MY QUEEN
- * HAIL TO THE KING

28:00.479 --> 28:03.115
- * THERE'S ONLY ONE KING
- * HAIL TO THE KING

28:03.149 --> 28:04.784
- * COME ON AND BE MY QUEEN

28:04.817 --> 28:07.453
- DREWSIE, YOU KNOW, UM,
BRIAN AND TED, OF COURSE.

28:07.486 --> 28:10.790
THIS IS, UH,
MICHAEL AND BEN AND JUSTIN.

28:10.823 --> 28:11.958
- HI, GUYS.

28:11.991 --> 28:13.926
- CLOSE YOUR MOUTHS, BOYS.

28:13.960 --> 28:17.997
DROOL'S GETTING ON THE FLOOR.
SOMEONE COULD SLIP.

28:18.030 --> 28:20.800
SO, UM, IT'S MY BABY'S
FIRST TIME AT BABYLON,

28:20.833 --> 28:23.836
SO LET'S SHOW HIM A GOOD TIME.

28:23.870 --> 28:26.372
COME ON, HONEY, LET'S, UH--
LET'S GO EXERCISE OUR THIGHS

28:26.405 --> 28:28.875
A DIFFERENT WAY TONIGHT.

28:28.908 --> 28:30.476
*

28:30.509 --> 28:34.346
- * HAIL TO THE KING

28:34.380 --> 28:37.950
*

28:37.984 --> 28:41.253
* HAIL TO THE KING

28:41.287 --> 28:45.357
* HAIL TO THE KING

28:45.391 --> 28:49.028
* HAIL TO THE KING

28:49.061 --> 28:52.965
* HAIL TO THE KING

28:52.999 --> 28:56.435
* HAIL TO THE KING

28:56.468 --> 29:00.439
*

29:00.472 --> 29:03.910
* HAIL TO THE KING

29:03.943 --> 29:07.279
* HAIL TO THE KING

29:07.313 --> 29:09.315
*

29:09.348 --> 29:11.150
- ANOTHER BEER?

29:11.183 --> 29:12.518
- HUH?

29:12.551 --> 29:14.887
- YOU WANT ANOTHER BEER?

29:14.921 --> 29:17.056
- UH, THANKS, BUT I HAVEN'T
FINISHED THIS ONE YET.

29:17.089 --> 29:20.026
- THANK YOU.

29:35.908 --> 29:39.311
- DO YOU HAPPEN TO NOTICE
ANYTHING PECULIAR?

29:39.345 --> 29:41.147
- LIKE WHAT?

29:41.180 --> 29:43.149
- LIKE THIS IS ONE
OF PITTSBURGH'S

29:43.182 --> 29:47.353
MOST FAMOUS RESTAURANTS,
YET WE'RE THE ONLY ONES HERE.

29:49.455 --> 29:53.025
- MUST BE A SLOW NIGHT.
YOU GOING TO FINISH THAT?

29:53.059 --> 29:55.962
- UH, NO, NO.

30:03.102 --> 30:05.171
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU SAID
WE WERE GONNA GO OUT,

30:05.204 --> 30:08.040
THIS ISN'T EXACTLY
WHAT I IMAGINED.

30:08.074 --> 30:10.376
- WHAT DID YOU IMAGINE?

30:10.409 --> 30:13.345
- FOR ONE THING, PEOPLE.

30:16.148 --> 30:18.851
DID YOU BUY THIS PLACE OUT...

30:18.885 --> 30:22.288
SO WE WOULDN'T
BE SEEN TOGETHER?

30:24.090 --> 30:26.325
- I DON'T LIKE THE ATTENTION,
THAT'S ALL.

30:26.358 --> 30:28.460
IT'S HARD TO HAVE A MEAL
OR EVEN A CONVERSATION

30:28.494 --> 30:30.129
WITH FANS COMING UP
EVERY TWO MINUTES

30:30.162 --> 30:32.965
ASKING FOR AN AUTOGRAPH.

30:32.999 --> 30:36.268
TRUST ME.
IT'S BETTER THIS WAY.

30:39.005 --> 30:41.073
IT'S GOOD YOU SAVED ROOM
FOR DESSERT.

30:41.107 --> 30:42.641
THEY'VE GOT
A KILLER CHOCOLATE CAKE,

30:42.674 --> 30:45.377
MUST BE A FOOT HIGH.

30:45.411 --> 30:48.114
I'LL NEED AN EXTRA-LONG WORKOUT
AFTER THAT.

30:48.147 --> 30:50.182
- [forced chuckle]

30:57.423 --> 31:00.626
- JUST DON'T SWEAR OR FART
OR MAKE STUPID JOKES, OKAY?

31:00.659 --> 31:03.162
AND DON'T DO ANY BETTE DAVIS
IMPRESSIONS.

31:03.195 --> 31:04.630
- [as Bette Davis]
WHEN HAVE I EV-AH

31:04.663 --> 31:06.632
DONE A BETTE DAVIS
IMPRESSION?

31:06.665 --> 31:08.234
- [laughs]
- BEN!

31:08.267 --> 31:10.502
WE PROMISE
WE WON'T EMBARRASS YOU, PAL.

31:10.536 --> 31:14.040
[knock at door]
- THAT'S THEM.

31:16.275 --> 31:17.910
- STEVE, AMBER.

31:17.944 --> 31:19.378
- COME ON IN.
CAN I TAKE YOUR COATS?

31:19.411 --> 31:22.114
- UH, NO, THANKS.
[clears throat]

31:22.148 --> 31:25.051
WE'RE NOT STAYING.

31:27.686 --> 31:29.288
- IF WE HADN'T GONE
THROUGH HER JOURNAL,

31:29.321 --> 31:30.656
WE NEVER WOULD HAVE KNOWN.

31:30.689 --> 31:32.524
- CONSIDERING WHAT KIDS
ARE UP TO THESE DAYS,

31:32.558 --> 31:35.561
YOU DO WHATEVER YOU HAVE TO.

31:35.594 --> 31:37.696
- YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW UPSET WE WERE.

31:37.729 --> 31:39.398
- ARE!

31:39.431 --> 31:43.402
- YOUR SON MAY HAVE EXPOSED
OUR DAUGHTER TO AIDS.

31:43.435 --> 31:46.138
- HUNTER DOESN'T HAVE AIDS.
HE'S H.I.V.-POSITIVE.

31:46.172 --> 31:47.406
- WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES IT MAKE?

31:47.439 --> 31:49.408
- VERY BIG DIFFERENCE.
I OUGHT TO KNOW.

31:49.441 --> 31:51.443
I HAPPEN TO BE
H.I.V.-POSITIVE TOO.

31:51.477 --> 31:54.413
- WE'RE VERY AWARE
OF SAFE SEX,

31:54.446 --> 31:56.315
AND WE'VE INSTRUCTED HUNTER
TO BE AS WELL.

31:56.348 --> 31:59.151
- I WORE A CONDOM.

31:59.185 --> 32:02.388
- I'M GLAD THAT YOU CAN BE
SO MATTER-OF-FACT ABOUT IT.

32:02.421 --> 32:05.224
- BUT YOU STILL
SHOULD'VE TOLD US.

32:05.257 --> 32:06.592
- IF MICHAEL AND I
KNEW IN ADVANCE

32:06.625 --> 32:08.360
THAT HUNTER AND CALLIE
WERE GOING TO HAVE SEX,

32:08.394 --> 32:09.962
WHICH, FOR THE RECORD,
WE DIDN'T,

32:09.996 --> 32:11.030
WE WOULD'VE DISCUSSED IT.

32:11.063 --> 32:12.198
HOWEVER,
THE IMPORTANT THING

32:12.231 --> 32:13.632
IS THEY BOTH
ACTED RESPONSIBLY.

32:13.665 --> 32:16.302
- WHAT THE HELL DO THEY KNOW?
THEY'RE 16!

32:16.335 --> 32:18.204
- MORE THAN YOU!

32:21.207 --> 32:24.043
- WE DON'T WANT HIM
SEEING CALLIE AGAIN.

32:24.076 --> 32:25.177
- NO FUCKING WAY!

32:25.211 --> 32:26.578
- CALM DOWN.
- THAT'S FINAL.

32:26.612 --> 32:29.081
- FUCK THIS SHIT!
- HUNTER, THAT'S ENOUGH!

32:29.115 --> 32:32.518
- EXCUSE YOURSELF.

32:32.551 --> 32:34.653
GO ON.

32:37.756 --> 32:39.258
[door slams]

32:39.291 --> 32:41.593
- WE'RE SORRY ABOUT HUNTER,

32:41.627 --> 32:45.097
BUT WE HAVE TO PROTECT CALLIE.

32:45.131 --> 32:48.367
- HOW DID HE GET IT ANYWAY?

32:51.703 --> 32:53.372
- THAT'S A PRIVATE MATTER.

32:53.405 --> 32:55.474
- [chuckles]
- HE HAD SEX WITH OUR DAUGHTER.

32:55.507 --> 32:57.543
I THINK WE HAVE
A RIGHT TO KNOW.

32:57.576 --> 33:00.479
- WHY DON'T YOU TELL THEM?
GO ON, TELL THEM EVERYTHING!

33:00.512 --> 33:03.115
OR WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO?

33:11.690 --> 33:13.092
- HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

33:13.125 --> 33:15.227
- I'M FINE.
HOW'S THE BABY?

33:15.261 --> 33:17.563
- THE BABY'S FINE TOO,
FOR NOW.

33:17.596 --> 33:19.765
- THANK GOD.

33:19.798 --> 33:21.367
- WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?

33:21.400 --> 33:22.768
- YOU WENT INTO EARLY LABOR.

33:22.801 --> 33:25.771
PROBABLY BROUGHT ON
BY STRESS.

33:25.804 --> 33:27.773
WHAT DID I TELL YOU
ABOUT TAKING IT EASY?

33:27.806 --> 33:29.441
- I KNOW, I KNOW.
- OBVIOUSLY, YOU DON'T.

33:29.475 --> 33:30.709
OR YOU WOULDN'T BE HERE.

33:30.742 --> 33:32.444
WELL, THIS TIME,
YOU'RE GOING TO LISTEN.

33:32.478 --> 33:34.280
IF YOU DELIVER
TOO PREMATURELY,

33:34.313 --> 33:36.182
THERE COULD BE
SERIOUS COMPLICATIONS.

33:36.215 --> 33:38.517
- ARE YOU TRYING TO SCARE ME?
- YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT I AM.

33:38.550 --> 33:41.420
- WE'VE MANAGED TO STOP
THE LABOR WITH DRUGS,

33:41.453 --> 33:43.122
BUT FOR THE REMAINDER
OF THE PREGNANCY,

33:43.155 --> 33:44.423
YOU'RE NOT TO LEAVE
YOUR BED

33:44.456 --> 33:45.791
EXCEPT FOR A TRIP
TO THE BATHROOM.

33:45.824 --> 33:48.194
NO EXTENDED WALKING,
NO LIFTING,

33:48.227 --> 33:51.530
NO PHYSICAL EXERTION
OF ANY KIND.

33:51.563 --> 33:52.664
DO I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR?

33:52.698 --> 33:54.633
- [sighs]

33:56.235 --> 33:58.404
- KEEP HER IN BED.
DON'T LET HER OUT.

33:58.437 --> 34:00.272
- I'LL STRAP HER TO IT
IF I HAVE TO.

34:00.306 --> 34:02.108
- YOU MIGHT.

34:02.141 --> 34:03.809
YOU'RE VERY LUCKY
TO HAVE SUCH A DEVOTED PARTNER.

34:03.842 --> 34:08.814

OH, YEAH, WELL,
THAT'S A LOT OF PIGS.

36:14.706 --> 36:16.808
WELL, IF SHE WANTS A CAKE
IN THE SHAPE OF A PIG,

36:16.842 --> 36:18.577

THANKS.
[beep]

36:24.983 --> 36:26.552
HELLO?

36:26.585 --> 36:28.220
- EMMETT.
- YEAH.

36:28.254 --> 36:31.957
- IT'S SIERRA.

36:31.990 --> 36:34.926
WE HAVE TO TALK.

36:36.462 --> 36:37.829
- W-WE, UH, WE DO?

36:37.863 --> 36:40.766
- RIGHT AWAY.
TODAY.

36:45.537 --> 36:48.474
- THERE YOU GO.

36:51.877 --> 36:54.446
- [clears throat]

36:54.480 --> 36:57.449
- EMMETT, I DON'T THINK
I'VE EVER BEEN SO UPSET.

36:57.483 --> 36:59.718
- I CAN IMAGINE.

36:59.751 --> 37:04.356
- I FELT THE BEST WAY
TO DEAL WITH THE SITUATION

37:04.390 --> 37:07.459
IS FOR US TO SIT DOWN TOGETHER
AND DISCUSS IT.

37:07.493 --> 37:09.595
THAT SEEMS PERFECTLY--
[clears throat]

37:09.628 --> 37:10.796
REASONABLE.

37:10.829 --> 37:12.364
- I WAS IN THE SHOWER
THIS MORNING

37:12.398 --> 37:15.867
WHEN DREW GOT THE CALL.

37:15.901 --> 37:17.669
- WHAT CALL?

37:17.703 --> 37:19.738
- FROM OUR WEDDING PLANNER.

37:19.771 --> 37:23.375
SHE WAS RUSHED TO THE HOSPITAL.
HER APPENDIX BURST.

37:23.409 --> 37:27.346
SHE'S GOING TO BE
OUT OF COMMISSION FOR MONTHS.

37:27.379 --> 37:29.615
- OH. OH.
[chuckles]

37:29.648 --> 37:31.550
THAT'S A--[clears throat]
SHAME.

37:31.583 --> 37:34.486
- IT'S WORSE THAN A SHAME.
IT'S AN ABSOLUTE DISASTER.

37:34.520 --> 37:37.823
DREW AND I
CAN'T POSTPONE OUR WEDDING,

37:37.856 --> 37:42.528
SO I'VE DECIDED
I WANT YOU TO DO IT.

37:46.798 --> 37:48.500
I REALIZE
I'VE CAUGHT YOU OFF GUARD,

37:48.534 --> 37:50.035
THAT YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY,

37:50.068 --> 37:52.504
BUT PLEASE, EMMETT,
SAY YES.

37:52.538 --> 37:56.308
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS TO ME.

37:56.342 --> 37:58.043
- UH-UH, WHAT ABOUT DREW?

37:58.076 --> 38:01.413
I MEAN, SOMETHING TELLS ME
HE WOULDN'T WANT ME TO, UM--

38:01.447 --> 38:04.916
- I KNOW SOMETIMES
HE CAN BE A BIT GRUFF.

38:04.950 --> 38:09.455
OH, EMMETT, IF YOU ONLY
KNEW HIM LIKE I DO.

38:09.488 --> 38:13.659
OF COURSE, HE'S GORGEOUS
AND STRONG AND ATHLETIC.

38:13.692 --> 38:19.064
BUT HE'S ALSO KIND
AND LOVING...

38:19.097 --> 38:21.700
AND HONEST.

38:21.733 --> 38:22.934
HE'S...

38:22.968 --> 38:25.937
WELL, MY HERO.

38:25.971 --> 38:29.808
AND WE NEED A WEDDING
THAT'S WORTHY OF A HERO.

38:29.841 --> 38:32.544
YOU KNOW,
MY MOTHER USED TO TELL ME

38:32.578 --> 38:36.548
THAT THE WAY TO HAVE
A PERFECT MARRIAGE

38:36.582 --> 38:39.084
IS TO START OFF
WITH A PERFECT WEDDING.

38:39.117 --> 38:43.922
AND I JUST KNOW YOU'LL GIVE US
THAT PERFECT START.

38:45.991 --> 38:48.894
[bell ringing]

38:50.729 --> 38:52.631
- HEY, YO, WHAT TIME IS IT, MAN?
WHAT TIME IS IT?

38:52.664 --> 38:55.434
- HEY.

38:55.467 --> 38:56.702
HEY.

38:56.735 --> 38:57.903
I WAITED FOR YOU
OUTSIDE THE CAFETERIA.

38:57.936 --> 38:59.438
WHERE WERE YOU?

38:59.471 --> 39:01.840
- OH, I HAD TO STUDY
FOR THE CHEM FINAL.

39:01.873 --> 39:05.477
- YOU MISSED A GREAT LUNCH,
MYSTERY MEAT.

39:07.613 --> 39:11.983
DID YOUR PARENTS TELL YOU
ABOUT THE TALK?

39:12.017 --> 39:15.654
IT WAS TWISTED.

39:15.687 --> 39:18.857
SO WHAT DID THEY SAY?

39:18.890 --> 39:22.761
CALLIE?

39:22.794 --> 39:25.731
- THEY SAID YOU TOLD THEM
THAT YOU WERE A...

39:25.764 --> 39:27.866
A PROSTITUTE...

39:27.899 --> 39:29.768
THAT YOU HAD SEX WITH MEN,

39:29.801 --> 39:33.872
THAT THAT'S HOW YOU GOT IT.

39:33.905 --> 39:35.907
IS IT TRUE?

39:41.713 --> 39:42.914
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

39:42.948 --> 39:44.750
- HOW DO YOU TELL
YOUR GIRLFRIEND

39:44.783 --> 39:48.019
THAT YOU USED TO FUCK GUYS
FOR A LIVING?

39:48.053 --> 39:50.789
YOU'D NEVER TALK TO ME AGAIN.

39:50.822 --> 39:55.627
YOU'RE BARELY TALKING
TO ME NOW.

39:55.661 --> 39:57.496
- THEN YOU'RE GAY?

39:57.529 --> 39:59.831
- I THOUGHT I WAS.

39:59.865 --> 40:05.704
- ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT IS--
IS YOU WITH ALL THOSE MEN.

40:05.737 --> 40:08.507
THEM DOING THINGS TO YOU.

40:08.540 --> 40:09.941
YOU DOING THINGS TO THEM.

40:09.975 --> 40:12.177
- I DON'T DO IT ANY MORE.

40:12.210 --> 40:14.913
I SWEAR.

40:14.946 --> 40:19.417
- LOOK, I'VE GOT TO GET BACK
TO CLASS.

40:38.704 --> 40:40.606
- WE JUST HEARD
THAT REMSON PHARMACEUTICALS

40:40.639 --> 40:43.074
IS SPONSORING THE RIDE
TO THE TUNE OF 100 Gs.

40:43.108 --> 40:44.943
- OH.

40:44.976 --> 40:46.845
WILL WONDERS NEVER CEASE?

40:46.878 --> 40:48.547
- WE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING,
OF COURSE.

40:48.580 --> 40:50.549
- HAVING BEEN TRAINED
NEVER TO DIVULGE INFORMATION

40:50.582 --> 40:51.717
UNDER PENALTY OF DEATH,

40:51.750 --> 40:53.218
BUT IT HAS THE FINGERPRINTS

40:53.251 --> 40:55.687
OF ONE BRIAN KINNEY
ALL OVER IT.

40:55.721 --> 40:57.689
- NOW YOU CAN FORGET
ABOUT THE RIDE.

40:57.723 --> 40:59.758
- TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.

40:59.791 --> 41:02.160
YOU NEED YOUR REST.
GO TAKE A NAP.

41:02.193 --> 41:05.897
- YOU WANT TO CUT MY MEAT UP
FOR ME TOO?

41:05.931 --> 41:09.134
- OH, GOT TO GO.
- GOT TO TRAIN.

41:19.010 --> 41:20.712
- FRESHEN YOUR HEMLOCK?

41:20.746 --> 41:22.514
- WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
I WANT TO KILL MYSELF?

41:22.548 --> 41:26.885
- THE LOOK ON YOUR FACE,
FOR ONE THING.

41:26.918 --> 41:29.254
- MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE.

41:29.287 --> 41:31.256
[groans]

41:31.289 --> 41:33.258
- WELL...

41:33.291 --> 41:35.026
THERE IS AN ALTERNATIVE
TO GOING OUT

41:35.060 --> 41:37.863
IN A BLAZE OF GLORY,

41:37.896 --> 41:42.167
AND THAT'S GIVING THEM ALL
THE BIG "FUCK YOU."

41:52.911 --> 41:55.547
YOU KNOW THAT, UM,

41:55.581 --> 41:58.016
I ALWAYS SAY
IT WAS 'CAUSE OF ME

41:58.049 --> 42:00.652
THAT VIC SURVIVED
THOSE LAST FOUR YEARS.

42:00.686 --> 42:02.754
'CAUSE I BATHED HIM,
I FED HIM.

42:02.788 --> 42:06.024
- WIPED HIS ASS.

42:06.057 --> 42:08.326
- YEAH, RIGHT.

42:08.359 --> 42:14.299
- BUT THE TRUTH IS, VIC
FOUGHT LIKE A SON OF A BITCH.

42:14.332 --> 42:16.935
EVERY TIME
A NEW INFECTION HIT,

42:16.968 --> 42:18.704
OR SOME NEW MED
WOULD MAKE HIM FEEL WORSE

42:18.737 --> 42:22.674
THAN WHAT IT WAS
SUPPOSED TO BE CURING,

42:22.708 --> 42:24.843
HE WOULD...

42:24.876 --> 42:29.114
DIG DOWN INTO SOME
UNFATHOMABLE PLACE IN HIMSELF...

42:30.882 --> 42:33.184
AND SAY,
"I'M NOT GIVING UP YET,

42:33.218 --> 42:36.154
SO FUCK OFF."

42:44.830 --> 42:47.699
NOW, UH...

42:47.733 --> 42:51.002
YOU CAN GIVE ME MY TIP.

43:01.847 --> 43:03.749
- THANKS FOR HELPING ME
DRAG THIS DOWN, MICHAEL.

43:03.782 --> 43:05.350
- YES, THANK YOU, MICHAEL.

43:05.383 --> 43:07.686
- HEY, THIS IS MY KID TOO.
IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO HIM--

43:07.719 --> 43:08.854
- NOTHING'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

43:08.887 --> 43:10.355
I'M FINE.
WE'RE FINE.

43:10.388 --> 43:11.757
- THERE ARE A LOT OF WOMEN
WHO HAVE TO DO THIS

43:11.790 --> 43:13.258
AT THE END
OF THEIR PREGNANCY.

43:13.291 --> 43:15.727
- YET ANOTHER REASON
WHY I'M GLAD I'M A GUY.

43:15.761 --> 43:17.829
- STILL,
THERE ARE MANY PLEASURES.

43:17.863 --> 43:20.966
- ALONG WITH THE PAIN.

43:20.999 --> 43:24.602
- THERE.
ALL RIGHT, GET IN.

43:30.876 --> 43:33.845
- AND STAY IN.

43:33.879 --> 43:36.281
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING ELSE...

43:36.314 --> 43:38.383
CALL ME.

43:38.416 --> 43:41.987
OR BETTER YET,
I'LL CALL YOU...

43:42.020 --> 43:44.690
IN ABOUT AN HOUR.

43:53.899 --> 43:56.735
- OY, HE'S NEVER GOING
TO LEAVE ME ALONE, IS HE?

43:56.768 --> 43:59.270
- [chuckles]
PROBABLY NOT.

43:59.304 --> 44:01.272
- THEN THERE'S DEBBIE.
- WHERE'RE YOU GOING?

44:01.306 --> 44:02.841
- TO GET A BOTTLE OF WATER.
- I'LL GET IT.

44:02.874 --> 44:04.009
THE DOCTOR SAID
YOU'RE NOT TO MOVE.

44:04.042 --> 44:05.811
CHRIST, DON'T YOU LISTEN
TO ANYBODY?

44:05.844 --> 44:07.445
- IT'S JUST IN THE KITCHEN.

44:07.478 --> 44:09.280
- YOU CAN GO TO THE BATHROOM,
AND THAT'S IT.

44:09.314 --> 44:13.318
UNTIL THE BABY'S BORN,
I'M YOUR ARMS AND LEGS.

44:22.260 --> 44:25.163
- SO, I GUESS WE'RE STUCK.

44:25.196 --> 44:29.100
- YOU IN BED,
US WITH EACH OTHER.

44:29.134 --> 44:32.170
- FUNNY, ISN'T IT?

44:32.203 --> 44:35.140
- ACHINGLY.

44:36.842 --> 44:41.112
I'LL GET YOU YOUR WATER.

44:49.888 --> 44:51.790
- [over TV] A FINE MIST
THAT WON'T WEIGH HAIR DOWN

44:51.823 --> 44:53.959
SO EVEN FINE
OR THINNING HAIR LOOKS--

44:53.992 --> 44:57.195
- EVERY 3,000 MILES,
IF YOU WANT YOUR CAR TO RUN--

44:57.228 --> 44:59.097
- HEY, SPORT.

44:59.130 --> 45:01.366
I WAS WONDERING
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU.

45:01.399 --> 45:04.402
PEEL OFF THOSE PANTS
AND LET'S START THE CLOCK.

45:04.435 --> 45:08.106
- SORRY I'M LATE.
I WAS WITH SIERRA.

45:08.139 --> 45:09.808
I'M AFRAID YOU'RE
GOING TO HAVE TO DEAL

45:09.841 --> 45:11.977
WITH A VERY DISTRAUGHT FIANCEE
WHEN YOU GET HOME.

45:12.010 --> 45:16.147
- YOU DIDN'T TELL HER?
- NO, NO, OF COURSE NOT.

45:16.181 --> 45:18.416
I LEAVE THAT UP TO YOU.

45:18.449 --> 45:20.952
I JUST TOLD HER
I COULDN'T PLAN YOUR WEDDING.

45:20.986 --> 45:23.889
- OH. THAT.

45:27.025 --> 45:29.094
- SO, UM...

45:29.127 --> 45:30.829
WHEN ARE YOU
GOING TO TELL HER?

45:30.862 --> 45:33.131
- ABOUT WHAT?

45:33.164 --> 45:34.900
- ABOUT YOU.

45:34.933 --> 45:38.536
ABOUT ME.

45:38.569 --> 45:40.538
SHE LOVES YOU, YOU KNOW?

45:40.571 --> 45:44.409
MORE THAN LOVES YOU--
WORSHIPS YOU, ADORES YOU,

45:44.442 --> 45:47.012
BELIEVES IN YOU.

45:47.045 --> 45:49.414
YOU KNOW HOW HURT,
HOW DEVASTATED SHE'D BE

45:49.447 --> 45:52.250
IF SHE EVER FOUND OUT?

45:52.283 --> 45:55.286
- WHY WOULD SHE EVER FIND OUT?

45:55.320 --> 45:58.189
WHY SHOULD ANYBODY?

45:58.223 --> 46:02.260
- 'CAUSE IT'S THE TRUTH?
- OH, THE TRUTH IS...

46:02.293 --> 46:06.865
I HAVE NOTHING TO GAIN
AND EVERYTHING TO LOSE.

46:06.898 --> 46:10.401
YOU SEE, I'M AN INDUSTRY--

46:10.435 --> 46:14.005
DREW BOYD, INC.

46:14.039 --> 46:16.474
A LOT OF PEOPLE MAKE MILLIONS
OF DOLLARS OFF OF ME.

46:16.507 --> 46:18.209
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN

46:18.243 --> 46:20.278
IF THIS WERE TO GET OUT?

46:20.311 --> 46:22.914
I'D LOSE MY FRIENDS,
MY TEAMMATES,

46:22.948 --> 46:26.184
MY FANS, MY ENDORSEMENTS.

46:28.519 --> 46:30.288
BUT MOST OF ALL,

46:30.321 --> 46:35.226
I'D LOSE THE THING THAT
I LOVE MOST IN THIS WORLD...

46:35.260 --> 46:38.196
PLAYING FOOTBALL.

46:40.331 --> 46:43.301
BESIDES, I LOVE SIERRA.

46:43.334 --> 46:47.305
I WANT A WIFE AND KIDS,
JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.

46:47.338 --> 46:48.506
- AND WHAT ABOUT US?

46:48.539 --> 46:51.109
- NOTHING HAS TO CHANGE.

46:51.142 --> 46:52.477
AND NOBODY NEEDS TO KNOW.

46:52.510 --> 46:56.982
IT'S NONE
OF THEIR GODDAMN BUSINESS.

47:01.552 --> 47:06.491
- YOU KNOW, EVERYTHING YOU SAID
MADE PERFECTLY GOOD SENSE...

47:06.524 --> 47:09.460
AND I'M SURE MOST PEOPLE
WOULD AGREE WITH YOU.

47:09.494 --> 47:14.199
WHY TELL ANYONE,
WHY LOSE EVERYTHING,

47:14.232 --> 47:18.503
WHEN IT CAN BE
YOUR LITTLE SECRET?

47:18.536 --> 47:23.341
BUT YOU SEE, IT WAS,
UH, DIFFERENT FOR ME.

47:23.374 --> 47:26.377
EVERYONE COULD TELL
WHO I WAS FROM THE START,

47:26.411 --> 47:29.347
WHICH, BELIEVE ME,
DIDN'T MAKE MY LIFE ANY EASIER.

47:29.380 --> 47:32.383
I'VE BEEN BEATEN UP,
CURSED AT,

47:32.417 --> 47:36.021
SPIT ON FROM DAY ONE,

47:36.054 --> 47:39.991
WHICH IN A WAY,
WAS WORTH IT...

47:41.426 --> 47:45.330
BECAUSE I'VE NEVER
HAD TO LIVE A LIE.

47:46.664 --> 47:51.569
AND I'M NOT ABOUT
TO START NOW,

47:51.602 --> 47:54.505
NOT FOR YOU,

47:54.539 --> 47:57.442
NOT FOR ANYONE.

48:03.214 --> 48:05.083
[smooches]

48:07.585 --> 48:11.356
[sniffles]

48:21.166 --> 48:23.401
- WHAT GIRL'S GONNA WANT ME
WHEN SHE FINDS OUT

48:23.434 --> 48:27.338
WHAT I'VE GOT
AND HOW I GOT IT?

48:27.372 --> 48:30.341
- YOU'LL FIND SOMEONE.
YOU'LL SEE.

48:30.375 --> 48:32.577
- JUST LIKE MICHAEL AND I
FOUND EACH OTHER.

48:32.610 --> 48:36.481
- IT'S DIFFERENT
WITH A GUY AND A GIRL.

48:36.514 --> 48:40.551
I MEAN, SOMEDAY
SHE'LL WANT TO HAVE KIDS.

48:40.585 --> 48:42.287
I CAN NEVER DO THAT.

48:42.320 --> 48:44.555
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.
THEY'RE WORKING ON THAT.

48:44.589 --> 48:46.057
- I NEVER SHOULD'VE TOLD HER.

48:46.091 --> 48:47.625
THAT WAY, NO ONE
EVER WOULD'VE KNOWN.

48:47.658 --> 48:49.327
- NO, YOU DID THE RIGHT THING,

48:49.360 --> 48:53.231
THE HONORABLE THING--
TELLING HER THE TRUTH.

48:55.200 --> 48:57.168
- NO ONE'S EVER
GOING TO LOVE ME.

48:57.202 --> 49:00.338
- OH...

49:00.371 --> 49:03.741
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
WE LOVE YOU...

49:03.774 --> 49:06.477
WHETHER YOU'RE POSITIVE
OR NOT...

49:06.511 --> 49:09.214
WHETHER YOU'RE GAY
OR NOT.

49:09.247 --> 49:12.217
- AND OTHERS WILL TOO.

49:14.752 --> 49:17.422
- [crying]

49:19.357 --> 49:22.227
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
BABYLON?

49:22.260 --> 49:24.229
- HOPEFULLY, I'LL HAVE
THE STRENGTH FOR ONE QUICK SPIN

49:24.262 --> 49:25.663
AROUND THE FLOOR.

49:25.696 --> 49:28.099
- WELL, DON'T MAKE NOISE
WHEN YOU COME IN.

49:28.133 --> 49:32.503
I HAVE TO GET UP EARLY
TO GO TO SPIN CLASS.

49:32.537 --> 49:35.773
- YOU YOUNGSTERS, I DON'T KNOW
WHERE YOU GET YOUR STRENGTH.
