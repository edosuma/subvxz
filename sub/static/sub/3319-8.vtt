00:02.350 --> 00:06.223
I guess my favorite
childhood memory

00:06.310 --> 00:07.442
Really?
You lived there?

00:07.529 --> 00:09.531
Well, not on purpose.

00:09.618 --> 00:13.448
It was more of a...
border crossing situation.

00:13.535 --> 00:16.103
Did you lose your passport?

00:16.190 --> 00:18.235
No, we had plenty of passports.

00:19.497 --> 00:20.281
Our luggage was the problem.

00:20.368 --> 00:22.283
Anyway, eventually,

00:22.370 --> 00:23.980
we made it back into the States.

00:24.067 --> 00:26.765
At night.

00:26.852 --> 00:29.029
In a row boat.

00:29.116 --> 00:31.161
Wow.
Yeah.

00:31.248 --> 00:33.642
Heck of a way to spend
your fifth birthday.

00:33.729 --> 00:34.991
Also the night
I learned to swim.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.040
Anyway, what's your
favorite childhood memory?

00:40.127 --> 00:42.738
Um...

00:42.825 --> 00:46.916
Oh, you know what?
Got to meet Bo Jackson.

00:47.003 --> 00:48.700
I didn't... didn't
really meet him.

00:48.787 --> 00:50.180
Uh, my dad and I were invited

00:50.267 --> 00:52.008
to stand on the sidelines
at a Raider game.

00:52.095 --> 00:53.923
And Bo got chased out of bounds
and ran right into me.

00:54.010 --> 00:55.446
Broke my collarbone.

00:55.533 --> 00:56.969
Nice.

00:57.057 --> 01:00.277
I like to call it
"a football injury"

01:00.364 --> 01:02.584
Don't you like your dinner?

01:02.671 --> 01:04.019
Oh, yeah, it's fine.

01:04.107 --> 01:06.240

I'm not much of an eater.

01:09.852 --> 01:13.421
my college roommate is getting
married next month in Big Sur.

01:13.508 --> 01:15.031
And...

01:15.118 --> 01:17.555
I was thinking maybe
you'd like to go with me.

01:20.254 --> 01:21.777
Really?

01:21.864 --> 01:22.995
Yeah.

01:23.083 --> 01:27.783
So, like... kind of a...

01:27.870 --> 01:31.265
overnight sort of deal?

01:31.352 --> 01:33.049
Yeah, yeah.
It would be a weekend.

01:33.136 --> 01:36.966
At a hotel.

01:37.053 --> 01:38.663
I know we're trying
to take this slow,

01:38.750 --> 01:40.361
but, um...
I don't think I can get them

01:40.448 --> 01:41.666
to postpone the wedding

01:41.753 --> 01:44.191
and I'd really like
to go with you.

01:44.278 --> 01:45.366
No, no, no.
It sounds nice.

01:45.453 --> 01:50.197
Kind of a... romantic getaway.

01:53.287 --> 01:54.940
Uh... so is that a yes?

01:55.027 --> 01:58.857
Yeah, sure.
I'd love to.

02:30.062 --> 02:32.543
The second it came
out of my mouth.

02:32.630 --> 02:36.286
So, any food allergies
I should let them know about?

02:36.373 --> 02:39.855

It's 20 after 9:00.

03:23.115 --> 03:27.468
It was very nice.

sensibilities

03:51.187 --> 03:51.709

granddaughter?

03:51.796 --> 03:55.235
I'm good.

into bed with him right away.

I don't sleep with him,

09:19.646 --> 09:21.299
the more nervous I am
about sleeping with him.

09:21.386 --> 09:24.128

with him for the weekend,

09:30.700 --> 09:33.921
without being at least partially
drunk and/or high.

three months to open the present

and die alone.

11:23.987 --> 11:26.468
Unless it's against
your better judgment.

11:26.555 --> 11:28.731
Okay.

11:28.818 --> 11:30.559
I love you.I love you, too.

11:30.646 --> 11:32.126
Go wait in the car,
I'll be right out.

11:32.213 --> 11:35.477
Thanks for letting me
have this time with him.

11:35.564 --> 11:37.174
Oh, happy to do it.

11:37.261 --> 11:39.699
Just don't feed him
a lot of crap.I won't.

11:39.786 --> 11:41.744
No scary movies.Of course not.

11:41.831 --> 11:43.572
I don't want him
around your friends.Got it.

11:43.659 --> 11:46.880
Okay, have fun.How?

11:49.491 --> 11:50.971
Anything happens to Roscoe,

11:51.058 --> 11:52.537
I'm going to hunt you down
and kill you.

11:52.624 --> 11:54.626
Could have just said "bye."

11:56.019 --> 11:58.587
Oh, hey.
You must be "Big Sur."

11:58.674 --> 12:01.242
Uh, yeah, I guess.

12:01.329 --> 12:03.244
All right. Up top.

12:03.331 --> 12:05.028
We're tunnel buddies.

12:05.115 --> 12:06.595
"Tunnel buddies"?

12:06.682 --> 12:08.249
Yeah, I'm Christy's ex.

12:08.336 --> 12:10.860
Makes us...
tunnel buddies.

12:10.947 --> 12:13.515
Oh. Oh.

12:13.602 --> 12:15.125
No, I see.

12:15.212 --> 12:17.649
Actually, we're not
"buddies" just yet.

12:17.737 --> 12:20.261
She and I are taking it slow.

12:20.348 --> 12:21.523
Wow. Really?

12:21.610 --> 12:26.136
I hit that
the first night.

12:29.574 --> 12:30.401
Well, it was
so nice to meet you.

12:30.488 --> 12:33.709
Likewise.

12:33.796 --> 12:35.711
Oh, Big Sur--

12:35.798 --> 12:40.020
when it does happen,
you're going to love it.

12:40.107 --> 12:41.499
Love. It.

12:46.896 --> 12:48.202
[knocking]

12:48.289 --> 12:50.334
CHRISTY:
Could somebody get the door?

12:50.421 --> 12:52.075
BONNIE:
Hang on!

12:56.384 --> 12:57.211
Hello.

12:57.298 --> 12:58.473
Oh, look at you.

12:58.560 --> 13:00.127
Like a puppy.

13:00.214 --> 13:02.651
Come on in.
Come on.

13:05.436 --> 13:07.264
I'm Bonnie,
Christy's mom.

13:07.351 --> 13:09.223
Oh, pleasure to meet you.
Adam Henchy.
I know.

13:09.310 --> 13:10.528
Christy, he's here,
he's adorable,

13:10.615 --> 13:12.661
I can't believe
you waited.

13:12.748 --> 13:14.968
I'm almost done packing
I'll be right there.

13:15.055 --> 13:16.143
Oh, no hurry.

13:16.230 --> 13:17.274
You're talking to my mother--

13:17.361 --> 13:18.972
believe me there's a hurry.

13:19.059 --> 13:21.757
Let me introduce you
to the rest of the family.

13:21.844 --> 13:23.803
This is Christy's
daughter, Violet.

13:23.890 --> 13:24.978
Violet, yes.
Finally.

13:25.065 --> 13:26.762
I've heard so
much about you.

13:26.849 --> 13:28.372
Hey.

13:28.459 --> 13:30.766
Don't take it personal.
She's not very nice.

13:30.853 --> 13:34.030
And this is her
boyfriend, Luke.
Hi.

13:34.117 --> 13:35.553
Oh, good luck
this weekend.

13:35.640 --> 13:37.817
I am pulling for you.

13:39.906 --> 13:42.691
Don't stand too close,
he'll impregnate you.

13:42.778 --> 13:45.259
So, Adam,
big trip, huh?

13:45.346 --> 13:46.651
Uh, yeah.

13:46.738 --> 13:47.957
My college roommate's
getting married.

13:48.044 --> 13:49.393
That's not what
I'm talking about.

13:49.480 --> 13:52.092
What are you talking about?

13:52.179 --> 13:54.659
You know what
I'm talking about.

13:54.746 --> 13:58.185
I don't want to talk about
what you want to talk about.

13:58.272 --> 14:00.187
She's going to tell
me everything

14:00.274 --> 14:00.578
when she gets
back anyway.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.278
Christy, help!

14:04.365 --> 14:06.454
Whatever she said,
I'm sorry.

14:06.541 --> 14:07.672
It was nice to meet you.

14:07.759 --> 14:07.847
Just keep walking.Okay.

14:10.501 --> 14:11.502
Ladies first.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.161
You bring your bathing suit?

14:18.248 --> 14:21.121
Huh? What? No.

14:26.169 --> 14:27.736
Oh, damn, I'm nervous.

14:27.823 --> 14:30.043
About what?

14:30.130 --> 14:32.436
Really?
You're going to make me say it?

14:32.523 --> 14:36.440
No.
I'm just as nervous.

14:36.527 --> 14:38.616
Well, I find that if
you talk about your fears,

14:38.703 --> 14:40.357
you take away
their power.

14:40.444 --> 14:41.532
Yeah, I find that, too.

14:41.619 --> 14:43.186
All right,
well, then,

14:43.273 --> 14:44.840
let's just put
everything on the table, yeah?

14:44.927 --> 14:46.276
We've been seeing each
other for three months,

14:46.363 --> 14:48.017
and sometime tonight,

14:48.104 --> 14:49.584
we are going to have
sex for the very first time.

14:49.671 --> 14:53.109
Woo! There.
I said it.

14:53.196 --> 14:57.026
I feel better.
How about you?

14:57.113 --> 14:57.679
Oh, yeah.

15:06.601 --> 15:08.385
Beautiful wedding, huh?Yeah.

15:08.472 --> 15:09.647
You know, they met
on a dating website.

15:09.734 --> 15:11.649
No kidding.
Yep.

15:11.736 --> 15:14.870
First date, they fell
into bed with each other

15:14.957 --> 15:18.395
and they've been all over each
other ever since.

15:18.482 --> 15:21.224
That explains why she grabbed
his ass at the altar.

15:21.311 --> 15:22.573
Right.

15:22.660 --> 15:26.621
So, what do you
feel like doing?

15:26.708 --> 15:29.058
Really?

15:29.145 --> 15:30.668
You're going
to make me say it?

15:39.112 --> 15:39.764
I'll be right back.

15:39.851 --> 15:42.115
Okay.

15:46.902 --> 15:49.296
My friends really liked you.

15:49.383 --> 15:50.732
I liked them, too.Yeah?

15:50.819 --> 15:53.778
Uh, what'd you think
of the band?

15:53.865 --> 15:55.824
They were okay.

15:55.911 --> 15:58.348
Where'd you learn
to dance like that?

15:58.435 --> 16:00.307
Oh, believe it or not--
Boy Scout camp.

16:00.394 --> 16:01.612
Really?

16:01.699 --> 16:03.397
That's right, yeah.

16:03.484 --> 16:04.876
One of my Scout Leaders
used to dance on Broadway.

16:04.964 --> 16:07.575
He taught us guys everything.

16:07.662 --> 16:09.664
The Waltz, the Salsa, the Tango.

16:09.751 --> 16:11.753
Some of the parents
actually got really upset.

16:11.840 --> 16:15.975
Kind of like Footloose.

16:20.936 --> 16:23.460
How you-how you doing in there?

16:23.547 --> 16:25.071
Almost.Oh, you know.

16:25.158 --> 16:28.248
I think there's
a full moon tonight.

16:28.335 --> 16:31.251
[shrieks]

16:31.338 --> 16:32.904
Christy!

16:32.992 --> 16:36.386
Oh. Hey.

16:36.473 --> 16:37.648
What are you doing?Um...

16:37.735 --> 16:40.869
I'm running away.

16:40.956 --> 16:42.523
Why?

16:42.610 --> 16:46.179
I'm just not ready
to have sex with you.

16:46.788 --> 16:49.182
Get in here.

16:49.269 --> 16:51.227
Are you out of your mind?

16:51.314 --> 16:53.186
Uh, maybe. Yeah.

16:53.273 --> 16:55.753
Why didn't you
just say something?

16:55.840 --> 17:01.977
Oh, I thought it'd
be easier to just...

17:02.064 --> 17:03.587
crawl through
the bathroom window,

17:03.674 --> 17:07.765
shimmy down a drainpipe
and take a bus home.

17:07.852 --> 17:10.159
You thought that'd be easier?

17:10.246 --> 17:11.943
Oh, come on,
don't make me defend it.

17:12.031 --> 17:14.685
All right, fine.
Just tell me the truth.

17:14.771 --> 17:16.339
Is the problem me?

17:16.425 --> 17:18.559
Is it that you just don't
want to be with me?

17:18.646 --> 17:20.996
No, you're terrific.

17:21.083 --> 17:22.998
The problem is me.

17:23.085 --> 17:25.566
I'm just too scared.

17:25.653 --> 17:28.656
Oh, Christy.
Come here.

17:28.743 --> 17:30.527
There's nothing
to be scared of.

17:30.614 --> 17:31.920
Yeah, there is.

17:32.007 --> 17:34.140
Name three things.

17:35.619 --> 17:38.622
Number one--
you see me naked

17:38.709 --> 17:41.930
and there's a couple of tattoos
that will need explaining.

17:42.017 --> 17:43.627
Number two--

17:43.714 --> 17:46.108
should we start out
simple, guy on top,

17:46.195 --> 17:49.155
or do we go straight
for Cirque du Soleil?

17:49.242 --> 17:50.330
Number three-- sounds.

17:50.417 --> 17:51.853
Should they be real,

17:51.940 --> 17:53.855
or should they be,
"Ooh, baby, ooh, baby"?

17:53.942 --> 17:55.944
Number four--Oh-oh, that's fine.

17:56.031 --> 17:57.685
Just wanted three.

17:57.772 --> 17:59.426
No, no, no, no.
I'm just getting started.

17:59.513 --> 18:01.167
Ooh, here's a good one--
what if you can't do it?

18:01.254 --> 18:03.038
Who ends up crying in
the shower, me or you?

18:03.125 --> 18:06.824
Probably me.

18:06.911 --> 18:10.045
I'm telling you,
we're doomed.

18:10.132 --> 18:11.481
Wow.

18:11.568 --> 18:14.528
I've disappointed
a few women in my life,

18:14.615 --> 18:15.833
but this is my first
Doomsday scenario.

18:15.920 --> 18:19.707
Listen.

18:19.794 --> 18:23.580
The reason I'm not ready
to have sex with you

18:23.667 --> 18:25.930
is because I'm still
figuring out who I am,

18:26.017 --> 18:29.717
and until I do...

18:31.675 --> 18:34.939
I don't think I can be
in a relationship.

18:35.026 --> 18:37.594
So, what does that mean?

18:39.292 --> 18:42.121
It means
we take a break.

18:42.208 --> 18:43.470
[sighs]

18:43.557 --> 18:46.342
So, what, we'll just be,
like, friends?

18:46.429 --> 18:49.302
Yeah. Friends.

18:49.389 --> 18:50.999
Oh, God.

18:51.086 --> 18:53.741
How do I always wind up being
friends with hot chicks?

18:53.828 --> 18:56.135
Unbelievable.

18:56.222 --> 18:57.788
I'm sorry.

18:57.875 --> 19:02.489
That's okay.

19:02.576 --> 19:05.927
[breathes deeply]

19:06.014 --> 19:08.277
All right, friend.

19:08.364 --> 19:09.931
What do you say,
you hungry?

19:10.018 --> 19:11.976
Want to get some
room service?

19:12.063 --> 19:15.415
No, actually,
I'm not hungry at all.

19:15.502 --> 19:18.853
Yeah, well, I'm starving.

19:18.940 --> 19:22.726
Hi, could you connect me
with room service, please?

19:22.813 --> 19:26.991
Oh, Adam, don't use food
to cover up your feelings.

19:27.078 --> 19:30.125
Shut up.

19:37.654 --> 19:38.438
[knocking]

19:40.483 --> 19:42.398
Hello, Christy.

19:42.485 --> 19:46.620
Oh, hi.

19:46.707 --> 19:48.230
What a surprise.

19:48.317 --> 19:49.753
We need to talk.

19:49.840 --> 19:51.625
We do?

19:51.712 --> 19:53.714
Yes, we do.

19:53.801 --> 19:54.976
May I come in?

19:55.063 --> 19:56.978
Yeah, sure.

19:57.065 --> 19:58.501
BONNIE:
I was wrong.

19:58.588 --> 19:59.328
I'd like to have sex
in a hotel bathrobe.

20:04.159 --> 20:06.814
Mom, this is
"Clowdia."

20:06.901 --> 20:08.119
Gabriel's wife.

20:08.207 --> 20:11.166
Oh, well.

20:11.253 --> 20:12.298
Isn't it, uh,
nice to meet you.

20:15.344 --> 20:17.781
Hello.

20:17.868 --> 20:18.956
Got your back.

20:23.526 --> 20:27.095
So... what's up?

20:27.182 --> 20:29.402
I confronted Gabriel
about the affair.

20:29.489 --> 20:30.446
Really?

20:30.533 --> 20:34.058
What did he say?

20:34.145 --> 20:35.538
He denied it.

20:35.625 --> 20:36.974
He said it was
all in my imagination

20:37.061 --> 20:39.281
because I have
a drinking problem.

20:39.368 --> 20:42.502
And...
do you believe him?

20:44.373 --> 20:47.898
I do, I'm a mess.

20:47.985 --> 20:49.813
Yes, you are!

20:49.900 --> 20:52.338
Can you help me?

20:52.425 --> 20:54.035
Yes, I can!

20:54.122 --> 20:55.645
Wait, why me?

20:55.732 --> 20:57.299
Gabriel said you're
a huge alcoholic

20:57.386 --> 20:58.518
and it wrecked your life.

20:58.605 --> 21:01.172
He's right again!

21:01.260 --> 21:03.349
Bring it on in, sloppy.

21:03.436 --> 21:05.220
BONNIE:
Aw, I wanted to hit her.
