( moaning )

01:56.910 --> 02:00.311
( screaming )

02:12.030 --> 02:13.622
OH, WHOA.

02:13.730 --> 02:14.549

02:14.660 --> 02:16.025

02:16.130 --> 02:17.927
OH, I KNOW.

02:18.030 --> 02:21.261
YOU WENT A LITTLE
"SHOWGIRLS" ON ME THERE.

02:21.370 --> 02:24.533
NOT THAT
I'M COMPLAINING.

02:29.140 --> 02:30.869
HAPPY AN NIVERSARY,
BABY.

02:30.980 --> 02:32.311
( giggling )

02:32.420 --> 02:33.819
SAME TIME NEXT YEAR ?

02:33.920 --> 02:35.547
YOU KIDDING ?

02:35.650 --> 02:36.912
I GOT NEEDS.

02:37.020 --> 02:39.409
I BETTER WAKE UP IN THE MORNING
WITH YOU ALL OVER ME.

02:39.520 --> 02:41.852
I HOPE YOU DON'T THINK
I'M WAITING 'TIL MORNING.

02:43.960 --> 02:45.848
LET'S GO SHOWER.

02:49.870 --> 02:52.191
GIVE ME A MINUTE.

02:52.300 --> 02:54.689
THIS FEELS TOO NICE.

02:54.800 --> 02:57.166
JUST DON'T
COOK YOURSELF.

03:03.010 --> 03:06.571
( heavy breathing )

03:19.860 --> 03:20.497
( glass breaking )

03:20.600 --> 03:21.692
( screaming )

03:23.670 --> 03:25.319
HONEY ?

03:26.500 --> 03:28.559
ANNIE,
ARE YOU OKAY ?

03:35.840 --> 03:37.705
ANNIE ?!

03:38.780 --> 03:39.610
ANNIE ?!

03:39.720 --> 03:40.778
ANNIE ?!

03:42.590 --> 03:46.788
OH MY GOD, ANNIE,
OH MY GOD !

03:52.360 --> 03:54.089
I'M REALLY
GONNA MISS YOU.

03:54.200 --> 03:55.224
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
WE'VE BEEN APART

03:55.330 --> 03:56.763
FOR ANY REAL
LENGTH OF TIME.

03:56.870 --> 03:58.019
NOT THAT LONG.

03:58.130 --> 03:59.961
KEITH, THREE MONTHS
IS A LONG TIME.

04:00.070 --> 04:02.937
DAVID, WE WERE SPLIT UP FOR
LIKE, WHAT, EIGHT MONTHS.

04:03.040 --> 04:05.634
WE WEATHERED THAT.

04:07.810 --> 04:10.301
OH GOD, YOU'RE GONNA GET
HIT ON BY REALLY HOT GUYS

04:10.410 --> 04:11.672
IN EVERY CITY.

04:11.780 --> 04:14.146
COME ON, IT'S BEEN OKAY
FOR BOTH OF US

04:14.250 --> 04:15.319
TO HAVE AN OCCASIONAL
RANDOM FUCK HERE,

04:15.420 --> 04:16.944
WHAT'S GONNA
BE SO DIFFERENT ?

04:17.050 --> 04:19.314
YOU'RE GONNA MEET SOME
COOLER, SMARTER, HOTTER GUY

04:19.420 --> 04:22.082
WHO'S A LOT EASIER TO
GET ALONG WITH THAN I AM.

04:22.190 --> 04:23.521
I COULD DO
THAT HERE.

04:23.630 --> 04:25.689
YEAH, THANKS, THAT
MAKES ME FEEL A LOT BETI'ER.

04:25.790 --> 04:28.156
AND BESIDES, WE'RE GONNA
BE ABLE TO BUY A FUCKING HOUSE

04:28.260 --> 04:29.466
WITH THE MONEY
I'M MAKING.

04:29.570 --> 04:31.197
WITH A POOL AND A HOT TUB
AND A STEAM SHOWER.

04:31.300 --> 04:33.666
AND ROOM FOR KIDS.

04:33.770 --> 04:35.658
YEAH, ALL OF WHICH YOU'LL
BE SHARING WITH THE COOLER,

04:35.770 --> 04:38.659
SMARTER, HO'I'I'ER GUY
YOU'RE GONNA MEET ON TOUR.

04:38.770 --> 04:41.534
DON'T YOU KNOW
I AIN'T LOOKING ?

04:41.640 --> 04:45.041
I AM SE'I'I'LED DOWN,
I FOUND WHAT I WANT.

04:45.150 --> 04:47.277
BESIDES, THIS'LL
BE GOOD FOR US.

04:47.380 --> 04:50.645
HOW WILL THIS
BE GOOD FOR US ?

04:50.750 --> 04:52.752
IT'LL SHOW YOU,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY.

04:52.860 --> 04:54.418
C'MON, DAVID,
WHAT DOES IT TAKE ?

04:54.520 --> 04:55.316
DON'T BE
SO INSECURE.

04:55.420 --> 04:56.648
I LOVE YOU.

04:58.360 --> 04:59.850
I'M NOT INSECURE.

04:59.960 --> 05:02.326
IF YOU WANT ME NOT TO DO
ANYTHING WHILE I'M GONE,

05:02.430 --> 05:03.522
JUST ASK ME.

05:03.630 --> 05:04.699
REALLY ?

05:04.800 --> 05:07.291
YEAH, AS LONG AS YOU
DON'T DO ANYTHING EITHER.

05:08.170 --> 05:09.364
JUST BE SAFE.

05:09.470 --> 05:10.664
OF COURSE
I'M GONNA BE SAFE.

05:10.770 --> 05:12.408
I'M SAFE WITH
EVERYBODY, BUT YOU.

05:12.510 --> 05:13.704
YEAH, BUT BE
EXTRA SAFE.

05:13.810 --> 05:15.675
EVEN WITH BLOW JOBS
YOU HAVE TO USE A CONDOM.

05:15.780 --> 05:16.405
( laughing )

05:16.510 --> 05:17.670
EXCUSE ME, BUT...

05:17.780 --> 05:19.179
DID YOU USE A CONDOM
WITH THAT PLUMBER ?

05:19.280 --> 05:20.474
NO, BUT THAT
WAS DIFFERENT.

05:20.580 --> 05:22.218
WE HADN'T MADE UP
THE RULES YET.

05:22.320 --> 05:23.912
AND NO SEX WITH ANYBODY
MORE THAN ONCE.

05:24.020 --> 05:25.578
WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.

05:25.690 --> 05:26.679
KEITH !

05:26.790 --> 05:27.779
DAVID !

05:27.890 --> 05:28.857
( buzzer )

05:28.960 --> 05:30.325
THERE'S MY CAR.

05:30.430 --> 05:31.681
HOW DO I LOOK ?

05:31.790 --> 05:33.894
SO FUCKING HOT
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.468
AWW, I'M GONNA
MISS YOU.

05:40.400 --> 05:42.265
I FEEL LIKE
I'M GONNA CRY.

05:42.370 --> 05:44.838
SO... CRY.

05:47.440 --> 05:49.203
CALL ME
EVERY NIGHT.

05:49.310 --> 05:51.039
OKAY.
STARTING TONIGHT.

05:51.150 --> 05:52.139
ALRIGHT, I WILL.

05:52.250 --> 05:53.945
( buzzer )

05:54.050 --> 05:56.348
ALRIGHT, BITCH,
CALM DOWN !

06:01.690 --> 06:05.057
BUSH JUST LIES
AND NO ONE CARES.

06:06.830 --> 06:09.298
NATE, YOU GOT FUCKING
OATMEAL ON MY PRINT !

06:09.400 --> 06:10.719
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

06:10.830 --> 06:12.661
HEY, NOT IN FRONT
OF MAYA, OKAY ?

06:12.770 --> 06:14.237
ASSHOLE.

06:14.340 --> 06:15.568
THIS IS REALLY
IMPORTANT TO ME.

06:15.670 --> 06:17.262
YES, NATE, THEY'RE
FOR CLAIRE'S CRIT.

06:17.370 --> 06:19.167
MOM, DON'T SAY "CRIT".

06:19.270 --> 06:22.706
IT SOUNDS WEIRD
COMING FROM YOU.

06:22.810 --> 06:25.040
WHAT, YOU TRYING TO BE
LIKE A MODEL OR SOMETHING ?

06:25.150 --> 06:27.368
NO, I'M NOT
SELLING ANYTHING.

06:27.480 --> 06:29.141
ISN'T THAT WHAT
YOU SHOULD BE DOING,

06:29.250 --> 06:30.444
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO SELL OUT

06:30.550 --> 06:31.983
TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER
AS FAST AS YOU CAN,

06:32.090 --> 06:34.308
BEFORE YOUR LIFE JUST
TOTALLY BLOWS UP IN YOUR FACE,

06:34.420 --> 06:36.752
BECAUSE IT WILL.

06:45.170 --> 06:47.229
IT JUST DOESN'T STOP,
DOES IT ?

06:47.340 --> 06:48.739
IT GETS BETI'ER...

06:48.840 --> 06:51.138
BUT IT NEVER
GOES AWAY, NO.

06:53.040 --> 06:54.701
MAYBE YOU SHOULD TRY
TO MEET SOMEONE NEW.

06:54.810 --> 06:56.971
MOM, I DON'T
WANT TO MEET--

06:57.080 --> 06:58.377
WHAT, DATE ?

06:58.480 --> 07:00.072
I DON'T WANT TO BE WITH
ANYBODY RIGHT NOW, I CAN'T.

07:00.180 --> 07:02.740
EVEN IF IT'S
JUST SEX, THEN.

07:02.850 --> 07:04.818
SEX CAN BE
VERY HEALING.

07:04.920 --> 07:07.957
MOM, IT'S OKAY FOR US TO BE
CELIBATE IF WE WANT TO.

07:08.060 --> 07:09.527
THANK YOU, CLAIRE.

07:09.630 --> 07:12.121
THEN MAYBE YOU
SHOULD GET A JOB.

07:12.230 --> 07:13.788
LOOK, I'VE BEEN
TRYING, ALRIGHT ?

07:13.900 --> 07:15.356
IT'S NOT THAT EASY
THESE DAYS.

07:15.460 --> 07:16.791
AND BESIDES, WHO'S SUPPOSED
TO TAKE CARE OF MAYA ?

07:16.900 --> 07:18.492
US, HER FAMILY.

07:18.600 --> 07:21.160
I THINK IT'S BEST IF I LOOK
AFTER MY DAUGHTER RIGHT NOW.

07:21.270 --> 07:22.430
THANK YOU.

07:22.540 --> 07:23.564
DON'T YOU THINK
WHAT'S BEST FOR MAYA

07:23.670 --> 07:25.661
IS TO HAVE
A HEALTHY FATHER ?

07:25.770 --> 07:29.206
MOM, ALL I DO IS THINK ABOUT
WHAT'S BEST FOR MAYA, OKAY ?

07:45.630 --> 07:46.722
A BEREAVEMENT GROUP ?

07:46.830 --> 07:47.922
MOM...

07:48.030 --> 07:49.588
I WAS A PROFESSIONAL GRIEF
COUNSELOR FOR THREE YEARS,

07:49.700 --> 07:51.565
I KNOW WHAT A LOAD
OF CRAP THIS IS.

07:51.670 --> 07:53.399
WHEN YOU LOSE SOMEONE
IT ACTUALLY HELPS

07:53.500 --> 07:54.762
TO SPEND TIME
WITH OTHERS

07:54.870 --> 07:56.701
WHO ARE GOING THROUGH
THE SAME EXPERIENCE.

07:56.810 --> 07:57.868
YEAH ?

07:57.970 --> 07:59.164
IF IT'S SO GREAT, WHY DIDN'T
YOU GO WHEN DAD DIED ?

07:59.270 --> 08:00.703
I DID.

08:01.640 --> 08:02.800
YOU DIDN'T
TELL US THAT.

08:02.910 --> 08:05.447
I WENT ONCE A WEEK
FOR SEVERAL NTHS.

08:05.550 --> 08:07.245
WHY DIDN'T
YOU TELL US ?

08:07.350 --> 08:08.874
ONE OF US COULD
HAVE GONE WITH YOU.

08:08.980 --> 08:10.743
I FELT LIKE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
WRONG TO BURDEN MY CHILDREN.

08:10.850 --> 08:13.216
MAYBE I COULD
HAVE USED IT TOO.

08:13.320 --> 08:15.550
WHY IS THIS FAMILY
SO REPRESSED ?

08:15.660 --> 08:19.380
I CAN TELL YOU FROM
EXPERIENCE, NATE,

08:19.490 --> 08:21.128
YOU'RE NOT SIMPLY GONNA
WAKE UP ONE MORNING

08:21.230 --> 08:23.425
AND FIND IT'S ALL OVER,
YOU HAVE TO GRIEVE.

08:23.530 --> 08:25.088
LOOK, I KNOW THAT,
I HAVE GRIEVED.

08:25.200 --> 08:27.430
I'VE DONE BIG
GRIEVING, OKAY ?

08:27.540 --> 08:31.704
I JUST FEEL LIKE I'M...
STUCK IN THIS QUICKSAND

08:31.810 --> 08:34.074
AND THERE'S SOMETHING BIGGER
THAN ME THAT'S HOLDING ME BACK.

08:40.920 --> 08:43.480
IT JUST DOESN'T
MAKE SENSE.

08:43.590 --> 08:46.047
SOMETHING AS
STUPID AS THAT.

08:47.290 --> 08:49.178
FALLING IN THE SHOWER.

08:50.090 --> 08:51.887
IT WAS MY FAULT.

08:52.630 --> 08:55.155
NO, NO,
OF COURSE NOT.

08:55.260 --> 08:56.659
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

08:56.770 --> 08:59.466
NO, I DRAGGED HER
OUT TO THE HOT TUB,

08:59.570 --> 09:03.700
MADE HER DRINK TEQUILA,
GOT HER ALL DIZZY.

09:05.810 --> 09:07.277
IT WAS
OUR ANNIVERSARY.

09:07.380 --> 09:11.146
MR. THORNTON, I THINK
YOUR WIFE WAS VERY MUCH IN LOVE

09:11.250 --> 09:14.970
AND DID ALL THOSE THINGS BECAUSE
SHE ENJOYED DOING THEM WITH YOU.

09:18.190 --> 09:19.851
WHY DID THIS HAPPEN ?

09:21.520 --> 09:23.852
OUT OF NOWHERE,
FOR NO REASON ?

09:25.430 --> 09:27.728
I WAS A GOOD HUSBAND.

09:27.830 --> 09:33.336
I LOVED HER,
I TOOK CARE OF HER.

09:33.440 --> 09:36.295
NOW WHY IS GOD
PUNISHING ME ?

09:36.400 --> 09:40.075
I DON'T THINK GOD PUNISHES
PEOPLE LIKE THAT, MR. THORNTON.

09:40.180 --> 09:44.549
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

09:44.650 --> 09:46.845
( sobbing )

09:47.520 --> 09:48.373
HELLO, RUTH.

09:48.480 --> 09:49.378
HELLO, BECKY.

09:49.480 --> 09:50.742
PAJAMAS.

09:50.850 --> 09:52.784
YES, IT'S HARD TO GET THEM
LONG ENOUGH FOR GEORGE.

09:52.890 --> 09:54.414
HE'S SUCH
A LARGE MAN.

09:54.520 --> 09:56.181
NOTHING WRONG
WITH THAT.

09:56.290 --> 09:57.325
NO, NO, I'M NOT
COMPLAINING.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.421
HOW ARE THINGS
WITH HAKIM ?

09:59.530 --> 10:01.555
HE GOT BACK TOGETHER
WITH HIS WIFE.

10:01.660 --> 10:02.820
OH, NO...

10:02.930 --> 10:05.421
YEAH, I GUESS I WAS JUST
A PRETTY TOY TO HIM.

10:05.530 --> 10:07.293
$22.40.

10:07.400 --> 10:09.038
I'M SO SORRY.

10:09.140 --> 10:10.630
I'M NOT.

10:10.740 --> 10:11.809
I LEFI' A BAG OF BURNING
DOG SHIT ON HIS FRONT PORCH

10:11.910 --> 10:13.537
AS A LITTLE
PARTING GIFI'.

10:13.640 --> 10:15.870
MOVIN' ON.

10:18.780 --> 10:22.841
YOU KNOW,
GEORGE HAS A SON.

10:23.690 --> 10:24.782
HE GOT A JOB ?

10:24.890 --> 10:26.755
I BELIEVE HE'S
INDEPENDENTLY WEALTHY.

10:26.860 --> 10:29.010
WHAT'S HIS NAME ?

10:29.120 --> 10:29.859
KYLE.

10:29.960 --> 10:32.690
HE'S ABOUT 40,
RATHER BOYISH.

10:32.800 --> 10:35.098
DOES HE HAVE
A MUSTACHE ?

10:35.200 --> 10:36.497
I LIKE A MUSTACHE.

10:36.600 --> 10:39.319
NO, BUTI BELIEVE
HE'S CAPABLE OF GROWING ONE.

10:39.430 --> 10:41.762
WHY IS HE
STILL SINGLE ?

10:41.870 --> 10:44.009
HE'S A VERY
COMPLEX MAN.

10:44.110 --> 10:47.534
I LIKE A MAN WHO
CAN KEEP ME GUESSING.

10:47.640 --> 10:50.677
MAYBE I'LL HAVE YOU
BOTH OVER TO DINNER.

10:52.680 --> 10:54.375
I'LL CALL YOU.

10:56.850 --> 10:58.386
SHALL WE START ?

10:58.490 --> 10:59.684
ANYONE ?

10:59.790 --> 11:02.156
THEY REMIND ME OF
KATY GRANNAN'S EARLIER WORK.

11:03.990 --> 11:05.855
YES, THEY CERTAINLY DO.

11:06.590 --> 11:07.852
I LIKE THEM.

11:07.960 --> 11:10.224
THEY'RE REALLY SIMPLE,

11:10.330 --> 11:14.130
UNPRETENTIOUS, PRETI'Y.

11:14.240 --> 11:16.561
LIKE CLAIRE HERSELF.

11:16.670 --> 11:19.559
I WONDER THOUGH...

11:19.670 --> 11:21.877
IF THEY'RE A LITTLE
TOO STAGED.

11:21.980 --> 11:24.448
MAYBE.

11:24.550 --> 11:27.075
ARE THEY STAGED,
CLAIRE ?

11:27.180 --> 11:28.738
WELL, YEAH.

11:28.850 --> 11:30.215
IT'S KIND OF HARD TO TAKE
A CANDID SELF-PORTRAIT.

11:30.320 --> 11:33.414
NOT JUST STAGED, BUT...

11:33.520 --> 11:35.317
STAG EY.

11:35.420 --> 11:37.024
MAYBE THEY'RE
A LITTLE STIFF.

11:37.130 --> 11:38.859
DEAD.

11:38.960 --> 11:40.757
THAT'S WHAT
I LIKE ABOUT THEM.

11:40.860 --> 11:45.399
THIS GIRL
WHO'S LIKE DEAD,

11:45.500 --> 11:48.663
AND BEYOND EVERYTHING,

11:48.770 --> 11:52.365
BEYOND HUNGER,
BEYOND SEX,
BEYOND BOREDOM.

11:52.470 --> 11:55.075
AND REALLY,

11:55.180 --> 11:58.809
IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL
TO BE IN THAT STATE.

11:58.910 --> 12:02.619
LIKE, NOTHING
CAN REACH HER.

12:02.720 --> 12:04.312
NOTHING CAN
GET TO HER.

12:05.750 --> 12:08.412
SEE, I WOULDN'T SAY DEAD,
I WOULD SAY EMPTY.

12:08.520 --> 12:10.829
YEAH, DEFINITELY EMPTY.

12:10.930 --> 12:13.023
WAS THAT YOUR
INTENTION, CLAIRE ?

12:13.130 --> 12:14.825
NO.

12:14.930 --> 12:17.728
I WAS TRYING TO CAPTURE
THE STILLNESS I SOMETIMES FEEL.

12:17.830 --> 12:19.525
REALLY.

12:19.630 --> 12:20.961
NOT EMPTINESS ?

12:21.070 --> 12:21.661
APATHY ?

12:21.770 --> 12:22.759
NO.

12:22.870 --> 12:24.201
STILLN ESS.

12:24.310 --> 12:25.709
OKAY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN THIS PICTURE ?

12:25.810 --> 12:27.437
NOTHING.

12:27.540 --> 12:28.575
BEING STILL.

12:28.680 --> 12:30.409
WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING AT ?

12:30.510 --> 12:31.647
WHAT ARE YOU
THINKING ?

12:31.750 --> 12:33.274
NOTHING.

12:33.380 --> 12:37.248
OKAY, SEE, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE ACTUALLY THINKING

12:37.350 --> 12:38.578
SOMETHING DEEP.

12:38.690 --> 12:40.510
OKAY, LET ME
ASK YOU THIS--

12:40.620 --> 12:42.417
AND FEEL FREE
TO ROLL YOUR EYES,

12:42.520 --> 12:45.284
BUT DO YOU REALLY WANT
TO PERPETUATE THE IDEA OF WOMAN

12:45.390 --> 12:46.948
AS A VACANT VESSEL ?

12:47.060 --> 12:48.596
IS THIS MORE
LESBIAN STUFF ?

12:48.700 --> 12:52.067
YES, I HAVE TO MEET MY QUOTA
SO I GET MY TOASTER OVEN.

12:52.170 --> 12:54.263
OKAY, I'M NOT TRYING
TO PERPETUATE ANYTHING.

12:54.370 --> 12:55.234
I DON'T HAVE
AN AGENDA.

12:55.340 --> 12:57.262
I SHOOT FROM A MORE
INSTINCTUAL PLACE.

12:57.370 --> 12:59.099
AN EMPTY PLACE ?

12:59.210 --> 12:59.904
I'M NOT EMPTY !

13:00.010 --> 13:01.671
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

13:01.780 --> 13:03.771
SO MAYBE WITH YOUR NEXT WORK
WE CAN SEE SOMETHING

13:03.880 --> 13:05.802
THAT ACTUALLY
IS INSIDE YOU.

13:14.760 --> 13:17.285
( doorbell )

13:21.760 --> 13:23.523
MAY I HELP YOU ?

13:23.630 --> 13:27.361
OH, I'M JUST
LOOKING FOR RICO.

13:27.470 --> 13:29.062
FEDERICO ?

13:30.310 --> 13:32.039

13:39.280 --> 13:40.542
HEY, IT'S ME.

13:40.650 --> 13:42.140

you called.

13:42.250 --> 13:44.138
I HATED THE WAY
WE LEFT THINGS THIS MORNING.

13:44.250 --> 13:46.286
How did
we leave things ?

13:46.390 --> 13:48.415
AWIQNARD.

13:48.520 --> 13:49.987
OH.

13:50.090 --> 13:51.785
I WAS JUST CALLING TO REMIND
YOU TO PAY THE CABLE BILL.

13:51.890 --> 13:53.050
I LEFT IT
ON MY DESK.

13:53.160 --> 13:55.856
OKAY...

13:55.960 --> 13:58.292
SO HOW'S IT GOING ?

13:58.400 --> 13:59.526
OH, IT'S GREAT.

13:59.630 --> 14:01.097
WE GOT OUR
OWN SUSHI CHEF.

14:01.200 --> 14:03.600
I'M EATING YELLOWTAIL, IT IS
OUT OF THIS FUCKING WORLD.

14:03.710 --> 14:05.837
I'M DRINKING
LU KEWARM COFFEE

14:05.940 --> 14:07.999
AND DRIVING A BODY BACK
TO THE FUNERAL HOME.

14:08.110 --> 14:11.500
I'M HAVING
AN AWFUL DAY.

14:11.610 --> 14:13.168
WHY ?

14:13.280 --> 14:15.043
I told you.

14:15.150 --> 14:17.209
THE WAY YOU LEFT THIS MORNING,
IT JUST SEEMED SO...

14:17.320 --> 14:18.412
WHATEVER.

14:18.520 --> 14:20.181
HONEY,

14:20.290 --> 14:22.679
YOU'RE JUST FEELING
NEEDY RIGHT NOW.

14:22.790 --> 14:23.825
"HONEY ?"

14:23.930 --> 14:25.352
WHEN DO YOU EVER
CALL ME "HONEY" ?

14:25.460 --> 14:27.792
BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT THEM TO
KNOW YOU'RE TALKING TO A GUY ?

14:27.900 --> 14:29.322
JESUS, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST CALL ME "DARLENE" ?

14:29.430 --> 14:32.319
I GOTTA GO,
THEY'RE STARTING THE MOVIE.

14:32.430 --> 14:34.034
WHAT MOVIE ?

14:34.140 --> 14:35.767

HORROR FLICK

14:35.870 --> 14:37.235
THEY WANT CELESTE

14:37.340 --> 14:38.307
I LOVE YOU !

14:38.410 --> 14:39.559
Gotta go.

14:48.850 --> 14:50.715

14:50.820 --> 14:52.082
WHAT ARE YOU

14:52.190 --> 14:53.555
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE ?!

14:53.660 --> 14:56.925
WELL, OBVIOUSLY YOU WEREN'T
GONNA COME TO SEE ME.

14:57.030 --> 14:59.089
COME ON, MARIA'S
WATCHING NICOLE TODAY.

14:59.190 --> 15:01.454
LET'S GO TO
MAGIC MOUNTAIN.

15:01.560 --> 15:02.891
( laughing )

15:03.000 --> 15:04.092
ARE YOU STONED ?

15:04.200 --> 15:04.928
SO?

15:05.030 --> 15:06.099
I DON'T HAVE
TO WORK TODAY.

15:06.200 --> 15:07.497
YOU CAN'T COME
IN HERE STONED !

15:07.600 --> 15:08.737
YOU CAN'T COME
IN HERE AT ALL !

15:08.840 --> 15:10.330
C'MON, YOU DON'T
LIKE ME ANYMORE ?

15:10.440 --> 15:11.907
OF COURSE I LIKE YOU,
IT'S JUST--

15:12.010 --> 15:14.706
I WANT YOU TO
TAKE ME TO DINNER.

15:14.810 --> 15:16.778
I GOT
A NEW DRESS.

15:16.880 --> 15:18.905
IT'S VERY SHORT.

15:19.010 --> 15:22.810
NO, SOPHIA, NO,
SOPHIA, NO !

15:22.920 --> 15:25.241
YOU GOT
THE WRONG IDEA.

15:32.260 --> 15:35.229
I SPENT ALL DAY
ALONE YESTERDAY.

15:35.330 --> 15:39.926
I WAS SO SAD,
I CRIED LIKE THREE TIMES.

15:41.470 --> 15:43.233
I MISS YOU.

15:44.670 --> 15:47.207
YOU'RE IMPORTANT
TO ME, RICO.

15:47.310 --> 15:49.938
YOU MAKE
MY LIFE BETTER.

15:50.580 --> 15:53.014
WHOA.

15:53.120 --> 15:55.076
WHOA, SOPHIA...

15:55.180 --> 15:56.875
I'M SORRY IF I DID
SOMETHING WRONG, BUT--

15:56.990 --> 15:58.719
YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG,
IT'S JUST...

15:58.820 --> 16:01.311
I CAN'T HELP IT
THAT I LIKE YOU.

16:03.990 --> 16:06.481
YOU'RE THE BEST THING
THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME.

16:11.530 --> 16:14.237
I GUESS
I SHOULD GO.

16:18.340 --> 16:21.503
MAYBE I CAN GET OFF
EARLY TONIGHT.

16:23.710 --> 16:25.200
UH, SORRY.

16:25.310 --> 16:26.379
NO, NO, YOU'RE NOT
INTERRUPTING ANYTHING.

16:26.480 --> 16:31.486
SOPHIA MORALES,
THIS IS NATE FISHER.

16:31.590 --> 16:32.614
NICE TO MEET YOU.

16:32.720 --> 16:34.119
YOU TOO.

16:35.360 --> 16:36.850
DO YOU NEED
ANYTHING ?

16:36.960 --> 16:40.191
I WAS JUST GONNA
PLAY SOME DOOM.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.865
( whispering )
Um, pick me up
at seven ?

16:43.970 --> 16:46.621
Okay, okay.

16:51.070 --> 16:52.537
( door closing )

16:54.710 --> 16:56.200
IT'S NOT
WHAT YOU THINK.

16:56.310 --> 16:58.699
RICO, I DON'T CARE.

16:58.810 --> 17:04.840
(video game sounds )

17:04.950 --> 17:09.580
( female on radio )
studios in Los Angeles,
this is Market Place.

17:16.660 --> 17:19.493
( male on radio )
patrolling for petro.

17:23.910 --> 17:25.537
More than on
any other land.

17:25.640 --> 17:27.471
No wonder about 40--

17:29.280 --> 17:31.373
HEY, I CAN'T BELIEVE
SOMEONE FINALLY STOPPED.

17:31.480 --> 17:32.401
WHAT'S WRONG ?

17:32.510 --> 17:33.818
I RAN OUT OF GAS.

17:33.920 --> 17:35.478
I KNOW, SO LAME.

17:35.580 --> 17:36.615
NO.

17:36.720 --> 17:38.517
IT'S HAPPENED TO ALL
OF US AT LEAST ONCE.

17:38.620 --> 17:41.009
YEAH, IT'S JUST I'M SUPPOSED
TO HELP MY GRANDMA TODAY.

17:41.120 --> 17:44.453
SHE BROKE HER HIP AND SHE
CAN'T MAKE IT UP STAIRS,

17:44.560 --> 17:46.687
SO, I TOLD HER I'D MOVE HER BED
DOWNSTAIRS INTO THE DEN

17:46.790 --> 17:50.089
AND I KNOW SHE'S JUST
SI'ITING THERE WAITING FOR ME.

17:50.200 --> 17:53.021
I'M SORRY, IT'S JUST
ONE OF THOSE DAYS.

17:53.140 --> 17:55.165
BELIEVE ME, I KNOW
WHAT THAT'S LIKE.

17:55.270 --> 17:58.364
ANY CHANCE YOU COULD GIVE ME
A LIFT TO THE NEXT GAS STATION ?

17:58.470 --> 18:01.030
I WOULDN'T EVEN ASK,
I JUST...

18:01.140 --> 18:03.904
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO DO.

18:04.010 --> 18:07.218
SURE, GET IN.

18:07.320 --> 18:10.619
WOW, THANK YOU
SO MUCH.

18:12.220 --> 18:14.279
IfM JAKE._
( engine starting )

18:14.390 --> 18:15.414
DAVID.

18:15.520 --> 18:18.751
DAVID, YOU JUST
SAVED MY LIFE.

18:24.730 --> 18:26.527
THIS IS SO MUCH FUN !

18:26.630 --> 18:28.689
I HAVEN'T BEEN
ON A CAMPUS IN YEARS.

18:29.470 --> 18:30.869
HI.

18:33.710 --> 18:36.531
OH, LET'S WRAP HIM UP
AND TAKE HIM HOME.

18:36.640 --> 18:38.198
NOW WHAT ?

18:38.310 --> 18:40.619
YOU'RE BEING WILDLY
INAPPROPRIATE, AS USUAL,

18:40.720 --> 18:44.212
AND, AS USUAL, I'M FEELING
IRRITATED AND RESENTFUL.

18:44.320 --> 18:47.448
WELL, THAT'S YOUR SHIT.

18:53.090 --> 18:55.126
OH, IS RICHARD BRAUN
TEACHING HERE ?

18:55.230 --> 18:57.323
YEAH, MY COGNITIVE
PSYCH CLASS.

18:57.430 --> 19:00.024
YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN ALL
THAT COGNITIVE CRAP, DO YOU ?

19:00.130 --> 19:02.667
YOU HAVE TO DIG
THROUGH THE PAST.

19:02.770 --> 19:05.967
JUST KNOWING WHERE BEHAVIOR
COMES FROM DOESN'T CHANGE

19:06.070 --> 19:07.276
THE BEHAVIOR.

19:07.380 --> 19:08.870
IT DOESN'T CHANGE
ANYTHING, EXCEPT...

19:08.980 --> 19:10.504
YOU KNOW WHERE
THE BEHAVIOR COMES FROM.

19:10.610 --> 19:14.546
YOU KNOW, RICKY BRAUN HAS
THE MOST UNUSUALLY SHINY PENIS.

19:14.650 --> 19:16.242
I WENT ON THIS
RETREAT WITH HIM

19:16.350 --> 19:18.386
AND WHEN HE'D GET OUT
OF THE HOT TUB,

19:18.490 --> 19:21.118
THE WATER WOULD JUST
BEAD UP ON HIS SCHLONG.

19:21.220 --> 19:23.927
DO YOU SUPPOSE
HE KEPT IT OILED ?

19:24.030 --> 19:25.725
I DON'T KNOW, MOM,
AND I DON'T CARE.

19:25.830 --> 19:26.979
HE'S A GOOD TEACHER.

19:27.090 --> 19:29.058
HE'S AN EXHIBITIONIST
AND AN IDIOT.

19:29.160 --> 19:31.822
THEN MAYBE YOU SHOULD
TEACH THE CLASS.

19:31.930 --> 19:33.295
HERE ?

19:33.400 --> 19:35.664
NO, THANK YOU, DARLING,
I'M NOT THAT DESPERATE.

19:35.770 --> 19:37.431
THIS HAPPENS TO BE
AN EXCELLENT PROGRAM.

19:37.540 --> 19:41.032
IT DOESN'T MA'ITER WHERE YOU'RE
DOING YOUR TRAINING, SWEETHEART.

19:41.140 --> 19:43.131
YOU'RE GONNA BE
A TERRIFIC THERAPIST.

19:43.250 --> 19:45.673
YOU REALLY HAVE THIS
UNCANNY UNDERSTANDING

19:45.780 --> 19:50.410
OF INTERPERSONAL DYNAMICS,
WHICH YOU'VE ALWAYS HAD.

19:50.520 --> 19:53.887
YOU JUST HAVE A PROBLEM APPLYING
THE PRINCIPLES TO YOUR OWN LIFE,

19:53.990 --> 19:56.083
WHICH IS SO
OFTEN THE CASE.

19:56.190 --> 19:57.487
I WAS WONDERING WHEN
THE INSULT WOULD COME.

19:57.590 --> 19:59.854
C'MON, WE'RE
EXACTLY THE SAME.

19:59.960 --> 20:02.428
WHO'S A BIGGER
TRAIN WRECK THAN I ?

20:04.930 --> 20:07.239
SO, HOW'S IT GOING
WITH OLIVIER ?

20:07.340 --> 20:09.797
HE'S A VERY
PASSIONATE MAN.

20:09.900 --> 20:13.631
HE'S A LOT OF FUN IF YOU
DON'T TAKE HIM TOO SERIOUSLY.

20:13.740 --> 20:17.301
AND HE IS COMPLETELY SUPPORTIVE
OF MY DECISION TO HAVE

20:17.410 --> 20:19.571
VAGINAL REJUVENATION SURGERY.

20:19.680 --> 20:20.715
OH, MOM.

20:20.820 --> 20:22.310
DARLING, I'VE HAD
A COUPLE OF CHILDREN.

20:22.420 --> 20:25.218
YOU, ESPECIALLY,
TOOK YOUR TOLL.

20:25.890 --> 20:27.084
I MEAN, C'MON.

20:27.190 --> 20:28.987
NO ONE WANTS TO FUCK
A GLASS OF WATER,

20:29.090 --> 20:30.921
IF YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M SAYING.

20:35.330 --> 20:37.093
SPEAKING OF CHILDREN,

20:37.200 --> 20:39.623
ARE YOU STILL INTERESTED
IN HAVING ONE ?

20:42.000 --> 20:43.194
I THINK SO.

20:43.310 --> 20:45.631
YOU THINK SO.

20:45.740 --> 20:48.231
AND IS JOE THE MAN YOU
WANT TO HAVE THEM WITH ?

20:48.340 --> 20:50.706
I THINK HE IS, YEAH.

20:50.810 --> 20:52.300
YOU THINK HE IS ?

20:53.850 --> 20:55.511
HOW'S THE SEX ?

20:56.850 --> 20:58.647
IT'S FINE.

20:59.250 --> 21:01.912
IT'S CREATIVE.

21:02.020 --> 21:03.749
IT'S INTERESTING.

21:03.860 --> 21:05.020
OH, DEAR GOD.

21:05.130 --> 21:06.279
YOU HAVE
TO DUMP HIM.

21:06.390 --> 21:09.029
MOM, LAST MONTH WHEN
I BROUGHT HIM TO DINNER,

21:09.130 --> 21:10.563
YOU SAID
HE WAS THE ONE !

21:10.670 --> 21:12.592
I KNOW, BUT I DIDN'T REALIZE
AT THE TIME THAT THE SEX

21:15.000 --> 21:16.297
THAT'S NOT GOOD.

21:16.400 --> 21:19.062
SEX IS SOMETHING
YOU SHOULD FEEL,

21:19.170 --> 21:21.070
NOT SOMETHING
YOU SHOULD THINK.

21:21.180 --> 21:22.499
YEAH, WELL,
I HAVE TO THINK,

21:22.610 --> 21:24.077
TO KEEP FROM BEHAVING
IN A COMPULSIVE

21:24.180 --> 21:25.272
AND DESTRUCT IVE MANNER,

21:25.380 --> 21:26.642
THANKS TO MY EARLY
EXPOSURE TO COMPULSIVE

21:26.750 --> 21:29.275
AND DESTRUCT IVE SEXUAL ENERGY,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

21:29.380 --> 21:30.938
I THOUGHT YOU JUST SAID
THAT POURING OVER THE PAST

21:31.050 --> 21:32.449
IS NOT IMPORTANT.

21:32.550 --> 21:34.108
CHANGE THE BEHAVIOR.

21:34.220 --> 21:36.415
I HAVE CHANGED
THE BEHAVIOR.

21:36.520 --> 21:38.454
WELL, THEN WHAT ARE
YOU COMPLAINING ABOUT ?

21:38.560 --> 21:42.018
THIS IS PROBABLY
THE HEALTHIEST RELATIONSHIP

21:42.130 --> 21:43.961
THAT I HAVE
EVER BEEN IN.

21:44.070 --> 21:46.026
I'M NOT
GONNA DUMP HIM.

21:46.130 --> 21:48.269
AS A MATTER OF FACT,

21:48.370 --> 21:50.634
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
MOVING IN TOGETHER.

21:50.740 --> 21:53.868
HA, NOW THAT'S
THE BRENDA I KNOW.

21:53.980 --> 21:56.005
( laughing )

21:56.110 --> 21:59.705
I HATE YOUR NEW HAIR.

21:59.810 --> 22:02.745
I COULD FEEL THE GENTLE
ROCKING OF THE TRAIN

22:02.850 --> 22:04.181
AS WE STARTED TO MOVE.

22:04.290 --> 22:07.817
AND HE WAS SO HANDSOME, SI'ITING
THERE AGAINST THE WINDOW,

22:07.920 --> 22:09.615
SMILING AT ME.

22:09.720 --> 22:13.451
WHEN I WOKE UP I COULD HARDLY
BELIEVE I WAS THIS OLD LADY

22:13.560 --> 22:15.653
IN BED ALL BY MYSELF.

22:15.760 --> 22:20.129
WHAT'S ODD IS I HAD COMPLETELY
FORGO'ITEN ABOUT THAT TRIP.

22:20.230 --> 22:23.461
IT WAS SO LONG AGO.

22:25.970 --> 22:29.428
I HAVE SO MANY MEMORIES
OF MY TIME WITH WALTER

22:29.540 --> 22:32.646
THAT I CAN'T EVEN
REMEMBER THEM ALL !

22:34.380 --> 22:37.076
MEMORIES ARE NICE,
AREN'T THEY, ELLEN ?

22:37.180 --> 22:38.818
MMM-HMM.

22:41.290 --> 22:43.019
THEIR ATM IS DOWN.

22:43.760 --> 22:44.829
REALLY ?

22:44.930 --> 22:47.854
I'VE GOT NO CASH SO I TRIED
TO USE MY CREDIT CARD

22:47.960 --> 22:50.667
TO GET A GAS CAN
AND A COUPLE GALLONS OF GAS,

22:50.770 --> 22:53.659
BUT OF COURSE I'M WAY OVER
MY LIMIT SO HE WOULDN'T TAKE IT.

22:53.770 --> 22:57.137
I BEGGED HIM, PLEASE,
AND HE LAUGHS IN MY FACE.

22:57.240 --> 22:59.629
HOW HUMILIATING
IS THAT ?

22:59.740 --> 23:00.729
I'M SORRY.

23:00.840 --> 23:02.102
MAN.

23:02.210 --> 23:04.405
I MUST HAVE BEEN LIKE, A SERIOUS
ASSHOLE IN A PREVIOUS LIFE.

23:04.510 --> 23:06.978
I DON'T THINK
IT WORKS THAT WAY.

23:07.080 --> 23:08.172
THINGS JUST HAPPEN.

23:08.280 --> 23:11.044
AT LEAST I STOLE
A PACK OF GUM.

23:11.150 --> 23:13.687
YOU STOLE THAT ?

23:13.790 --> 23:15.382
I FIGURED
HE DESERVED IT.

23:15.490 --> 23:17.082
YOU WANT A PIECE ?

23:22.300 --> 23:23.699
( laughing )

23:23.800 --> 23:25.927
NOW YOU'RE
MY ACCOMPLICE.

23:27.030 --> 23:28.463
SHIT.

23:30.140 --> 23:32.233
WHAT'S WRONG ?

23:32.340 --> 23:34.535
MY POOR GRAN DMA'S
STILL WAITING FOR ME.

23:34.640 --> 23:36.471
I'D CALL HER,
BUT SHE'S DEAF.

23:36.580 --> 23:38.002
SHE NEVER
HEARS THE PHONE.

23:38.110 --> 23:40.613
WHY DON'T YOU LET ME BUY
THE GAS CAN AND GAS, OKAY ?

23:40.720 --> 23:41.379
NO WAY.

23:41.480 --> 23:42.469
REALLY,
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

23:42.580 --> 23:44.081
I'M GOING TO.

23:47.050 --> 23:50.156
ONLY IF YOU TAKE ME TO AN ATM
SO I CAN PAY YOU BACK.

23:50.260 --> 23:52.751
OKAY.

23:56.300 --> 23:59.724
AN APPLE, SOME SHARP CHEDDAR
AND A HUNK OF CRUSTY BREAD.

23:59.830 --> 24:02.731
AND SOMEHOW, IT ALL TASTES
JUST A LITTLE BIT BE'ITER

24:02.840 --> 24:07.868
WHEN YOU CUT IT WITH YOUR
GRANDFATHER'S POCKET KNIFE.

24:07.980 --> 24:12.098
I'VE BEEN THINKING WE SHOULD
INVITE KYLE OVER FOR DINNER.

24:14.880 --> 24:15.778
WHY ?

24:15.880 --> 24:17.438
SO HE CAN MEET
MY FRIEND, BECKY,

24:17.550 --> 24:19.939
WHO'S QUITE ADORABLE
IN HER OWN WAY AND...

24:20.050 --> 24:21.586
QUITE SINGLE.

24:21.690 --> 24:24.250
RUTH, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING ?

24:24.360 --> 24:25.827
I'M TRYING TO
ARRANGE A DINNER.

24:25.930 --> 24:28.990
I CAN MAKE
MY VEGETABLE LASAGNA,
YOU LIKE THAT.

24:29.100 --> 24:30.522
AND BECKY
SAID SHE WOULD--

24:30.630 --> 24:32.188
YOU'RE MEDDLING.

24:32.300 --> 24:34.734
I DON'T THINK IT'S MEDDLING
TO SIMPLY INTRODUCE TWO PEOPLE.

24:34.840 --> 24:36.796
WHEN ONE OF THEM
HAPPENS TO BE MY SON

24:36.900 --> 24:39.960
WHO LEAVES BOXES OF SHIT
ON OUR DOORSTEP,

24:40.070 --> 24:41.628
OH YES,
THAT'S MEDDLING.

24:41.740 --> 24:44.743
BUT DON'T YOU
WANT TO HELP HIM ?

24:44.850 --> 24:48.513
I ONLY AGREED TO MEET WITH HIM
BECAUSE I WANTED YOU TO SEE

24:51.120 --> 24:52.985
IF I'D HAD ANY IDEA--

24:57.160 --> 24:58.388
CHRIST.

24:58.490 --> 25:00.287
LOOK...

25:00.390 --> 25:03.564
JUST LEAVE IT ALONE,
RUTH, OKAY ?

25:03.670 --> 25:05.422
YOU DEAL WITH YOUR
MESSED-UP CHILDREN

25:05.530 --> 25:07.498
AND I'LL DEAL
WITH MINE.

25:09.670 --> 25:11.467
I DON'T CARE FOR
THAT TONE, GEORGE.

25:11.570 --> 25:15.404
I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED
IN YOU, RUTH.

25:15.510 --> 25:18.047
VERY.

25:22.720 --> 25:25.018
WHEN YOU LOSE
SOMEBODY YOU LOVE,

25:25.120 --> 25:27.111
YOU TRULY HAVE LOST
A PART OF YOURSELF.

25:27.220 --> 25:29.688
BECAUSE YOU'VE SHARED
A LIFETIME WITH THIS PERSON

25:29.790 --> 25:31.985
IT'S ONLY NATURAL
TO HAVE MOMENTS

25:32.090 --> 25:34.991
WHEN YOU'RE FEELING
COMPLETELY LOST--

25:35.100 --> 25:36.658
WHAT IF YOU HAVEN'T ?

25:36.760 --> 25:39.399
WELL, IF YOU
DON'T FEEL LOST--

25:39.500 --> 25:41.764
NO, I DIDN'T GET TO SHARE
A LIFETIME WITH HER.

25:45.170 --> 25:48.139
I'M SORRY, I'VE BEEN LISTENING
TO YOUR STORIES AND THEY'RE...

25:50.410 --> 25:53.140
THEY'RE REALLY UPSETTING TO ME
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE THAT.

25:55.680 --> 25:57.511
I DON'T HAVE
A LIFETIME OF MEMORIES.

25:57.620 --> 25:59.542
WE WERE JUST
GETTING STARTED,

26:02.560 --> 26:04.585
JUST WORKING
THINGS THROUGH.

26:05.890 --> 26:08.324
AND, UH,
NOW I HAVE A...

26:08.430 --> 26:10.091
HAVE A TWO-YEAR-OLD
DAUGHTER

26:11.630 --> 26:14.531
WHO DOESN'T
HAVE A MOTHER...

26:14.640 --> 26:18.508
AND SO SHE HAS TO GET
EVERYTHING FROM ME

26:18.610 --> 26:20.999
BECAUSE I'M
ALL THERE IS.

26:21.110 --> 26:22.998
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO WITH THAT.

26:30.820 --> 26:32.981
MOST OF THE TIME
I JUST...

26:34.190 --> 26:35.680
I JUST FEEL NUMB,

26:40.900 --> 26:43.721
AND THEN SOMETIMES
I FEEL JUST...

26:45.330 --> 26:47.059
JUST TERRIFIED.

26:49.100 --> 26:50.658
THEN SOMETIMES
I JUST FEEL SO ANGRY,

26:50.770 --> 26:53.739
BUT THEN I DON'T WANT
TO BE THIS BI'ITER GUY,

26:53.840 --> 26:56.274
SO, I TRY TO
DEAL WITH IT

26:56.380 --> 26:57.529
BECAUSE I DON'T
WANT MY DAUGHTER

26:57.650 --> 26:59.606
TO HAVE TO LIVE
WITH THAT POISON.

27:01.550 --> 27:03.745
I TRY AND
BE THANKFUL.

27:03.850 --> 27:06.284
I TRY SO HARD
TO BE THANKFUL.

27:08.560 --> 27:12.223
AND I AM THANKFUL, I'M THANKFUL
I HAVE A BEAUTIFUL CHILD

27:12.330 --> 27:13.820
THAT LISA GAVE ME.

27:18.770 --> 27:20.123
AND SOME DAYS,

27:20.230 --> 27:22.369
SOME DAYS I JUST FEEL
LIKE I'M GOING CRAZY,

27:22.470 --> 27:24.267
LIKE I'M LITERALLY
LOSING MY MIND--

27:24.370 --> 27:26.668
( fire alarm )

27:26.770 --> 27:27.930
THAT'S THE FIRE ALARM.

27:28.040 --> 27:29.769
PROBABLY JUST
A FALSE ALARM,

27:29.880 --> 27:32.678
BUT JUST TO BE SAFE WE'RE
GONNA WALK DOWN THE HALLWAY

27:32.780 --> 27:34.748
AND OUT INTO
THE PARKING LOT.

27:34.850 --> 27:37.148
IS EVERYONE READY ?

27:42.490 --> 27:44.082
THANKS FOR
THE GAS, MAN.

27:45.930 --> 27:48.819
THIS IS ONE INCREDIBLY
SHITTY DAY FOR ME,

27:48.930 --> 27:52.798
BUT YOU ARE LIKE THE COOLEST
GUY I EVER MET, DAVID.

27:54.770 --> 27:56.738
NOW WE JUST GO'ITA
HIT THAT ATM.

27:57.770 --> 28:00.034
THEY'RE USUALLY
ALL OVER.

28:03.880 --> 28:05.700
YOU WANT
SOME WATER ?

28:05.810 --> 28:08.745
NO THANKS.

28:11.390 --> 28:12.982
ARE YOU GAY ?

28:14.460 --> 28:17.281
UH... YES.

28:17.390 --> 28:18.584
I THOUGHT SO.

28:18.690 --> 28:20.226
YOU LOOK GAY.

28:20.330 --> 28:21.957
OH.

28:22.060 --> 28:25.769
NO, I MEAN
YOU COULD BE.

28:26.900 --> 28:29.562
I WAS HOPING
YOU WERE GAY.

28:29.670 --> 28:32.764
I MEAN, I FIGURE
YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND,

28:32.870 --> 28:35.805
YOU'RE TOO
CUTE NOT TO.

28:35.910 --> 28:39.778
BUT WHAT IF I COULD
BE YOUR GUY ON THE SIDE,

28:39.880 --> 28:42.019
WHO UNDERSTANDS YOU

28:42.120 --> 28:45.647
AND LOVES YOU
UNCONDITIONALLY

28:45.750 --> 28:48.913
AND PRETTY MUCH LIVES
JUST TO PLEASE YOU.

28:50.190 --> 28:52.420
DO YOU WANT ME
TO TAKE MY PANTS OFF ?

28:52.530 --> 28:54.521
( music )

28:54.630 --> 28:56.495
HELLO ?

28:56.600 --> 28:58.022
DO YOU WANT
SOME WATER OR NOT ?

28:58.130 --> 29:00.837
NO, THANKS,
I'M FINE.

29:00.940 --> 29:02.532
DUDE, WHERE'D YOU GO ?

29:02.640 --> 29:04.699
I'M A LITTLE
PREOCCU PIED.

29:04.810 --> 29:06.869
I'M HAVING ONE
OF THOSE DAYS TOO.

29:06.970 --> 29:09.473
WELL, HEY,
SAY NO MORE.

29:18.150 --> 29:19.640
I SMELL SMOKE.

29:19.750 --> 29:21.081
DOES ANYONE ELSE
SMELL SMOKE ?

29:21.190 --> 29:22.953
OKAY, EVERYONE,
FALSE ALARM.

29:23.060 --> 29:24.823
WE CAN ALL
GO BACK IN.

29:24.930 --> 29:28.798
( chattering )

29:39.710 --> 29:42.406
* IT'S MY LIFE

29:42.510 --> 29:45.968
* DON'T YOU FORGET

29:46.080 --> 29:47.911
SO DID YOU GROW UP
IN LA. ?

29:48.020 --> 29:50.511
YEAH, ONE OF
THE RARE NATIVES.

29:50.620 --> 29:52.485
WHAT ABOUT YOU ?

29:52.590 --> 29:55.309
I WAS BORN IN
ST. GEORGE, BERMUDA.

29:55.420 --> 29:56.910
WOW.

29:57.020 --> 29:58.487
NOT AS EXCITING
AS IT SOUNDS.

29:58.590 --> 29:59.887
IT WAS A NAVAL
AIR STATION.

29:59.990 --> 30:01.890
YOUR DAD WAS
IN THE NAW ?

30:02.000 --> 30:04.798
AT FIRST AND THEN HE WORKED
FOR A FOOD SERVICE COMPANY

30:04.900 --> 30:06.128
THAT SUPPLIED THE NAW.

30:06.230 --> 30:07.697
I USED TO FANTASIZE
ABOUT RUNNING AWAY

30:07.800 --> 30:09.267
AND JOINING THE NAW.

30:09.370 --> 30:11.838
MOSTLY I JUST PICTURED MYSELF
WALKING DOWN THE GANGWAY

30:11.940 --> 30:14.670
IN MY SAILOR UNIFORM, LIKE
GENE KELLY IN "ON THE TOWN".

30:14.780 --> 30:17.237
WHO ?

30:17.340 --> 30:20.605
NEVER MIND.

30:20.710 --> 30:22.746
THE NAW SUCKS.

30:22.850 --> 30:25.648
WHEN I WAS LI'ITLE,
AS SOON AS I'D MAKE FRIENDS,

30:25.750 --> 30:26.978
MY DAD WOULD
HAVE TO MOVE.

30:27.090 --> 30:28.751
SO I WAS ALWAYS
THE NEW KID.

30:28.860 --> 30:30.953
YEAH, I KNOW
HOW THAT FEELS.

30:31.060 --> 30:32.687
I WAS NEVER
THE NEW KID.

30:32.790 --> 30:35.020
I WAS JUST
THE ODD KID.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.661
I THINK THERE'S
ONE IN THERE.

30:42.770 --> 30:44.658
WHAT ?

30:44.770 --> 30:46.101
ATM ?

30:46.210 --> 30:47.837
OH, COOL.

30:47.940 --> 30:50.306
* DON'T YOU FORGET...

31:03.860 --> 31:05.225
HEY.

31:08.060 --> 31:09.948
OKAY, THIS
IS THE DEAL.

31:10.060 --> 31:11.322
WE WALK IN THERE,

31:11.430 --> 31:13.261
YOU GET AS MUCH CASH
AS YOU CAN WITH YOUR ATM CARD.

31:13.370 --> 31:16.294
IF YOU TRY ANYTHING, I MEAN
IF YOU EVEN BREATHE IN A WAY

31:16.400 --> 31:19.938
THAT I DON'T LIKE,
I WILL SHOOT YOU IN THE SPINE.

31:21.640 --> 31:23.198
UNDERSTAND ?

31:50.400 --> 31:53.301
( beeping )

31:55.340 --> 31:57.979
I DON'T THINK YOU CAN
WITHDRAW 500--

31:58.080 --> 31:59.945
YEAH, YOU CAN,
DO IT.

32:00.050 --> 32:02.371
I DON'T EVEN HAVE
500 IN MY ACCOUNT.

32:03.280 --> 32:04.212
HOW MUCH ?

32:04.320 --> 32:05.548
MAYBE FOUR.

32:05.650 --> 32:07.083
DO FOUR.

32:15.360 --> 32:16.657
LET'S GO.

32:22.000 --> 32:23.297
( coughing )

32:23.400 --> 32:24.628
NICE TRY.

32:30.340 --> 32:33.343
WOW, I REALLY HIT
YOU HARD, DIDN'T I ?

32:35.250 --> 32:36.012
YEAH.

32:36.120 --> 32:37.849
I'M SORRY, BRO.

32:37.950 --> 32:39.486
IT JUST, IT FELT
SO FUCKING GOOD !

32:39.590 --> 32:41.353
GOD, I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
I WAS GONNA DO THAT.

32:41.460 --> 32:42.950
I JUST FUCKING,
I JUST DID IT !

32:43.060 --> 32:44.721
LOOK, YOU GOT YOUR MONEY,
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE.

32:44.830 --> 32:46.525
AW, DON'T BE
ANGRY, DAVID.

32:46.630 --> 32:47.881
COME ON,
GET IN THE VAN.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.729
I'M NOT GOING
ANYWHERE WITH YOU.

32:49.830 --> 32:51.263
OH, HEY, YOU'RE NOT
GONNA DUMP ME

32:51.370 --> 32:52.769
AFTER OUR FIRST FIGHT,
ARE YOU ?

32:52.870 --> 32:54.235
WE'RE BEST FRIENDS
FOREVER.

32:54.340 --> 32:56.638
NOW GET IN THE VAN BEFORE
I KICK YOUR MOTHERFUCKING ASS.

33:13.690 --> 33:15.487
LET'S GO, COWBOY.

33:15.590 --> 33:17.319
WHERE ?

33:17.420 --> 33:19.650
THAT WAY.

33:23.800 --> 33:25.267
HEY.

33:27.570 --> 33:29.060
WIPE YOUR FACE.

33:44.020 --> 33:45.487
AHH.

33:56.260 --> 33:58.490
DO YOU WANT ME TO TAKE
YOU BACK TO YOUR CAR ?

33:59.830 --> 34:01.331
I DON'T HAVE A CAR.

34:02.270 --> 34:04.329
WHERE I PICKED YOU UP.

34:04.440 --> 34:05.338
( laughing )

34:05.440 --> 34:07.135
THAT WASN'T MY CAR,
I DON'T HAVE A CAR.

34:07.240 --> 34:09.333
WHERE WOULD
I GET A CAR ?

34:09.440 --> 34:12.170
SO...

34:12.280 --> 34:14.111
WHERE AM I
TAKING YOU ?

34:14.220 --> 34:17.371
WELL, IT'S DEFINITELY
PARTY TIME.

34:17.480 --> 34:20.415
THERE ARE THESE GUYS I KNOW
IN LONG BEACH THAT DEAL METH.

34:20.520 --> 34:23.648
HAVE FUN ALL TWEAK-END
LONG, YOU KNOW.

34:23.760 --> 34:26.081
OH, NO, NO, WE'LL DO IT
OLD SCHOOL TONIGHT.

34:26.190 --> 34:27.225
MACARTHUR PARK.

34:27.330 --> 34:29.525
HEAD ON DOWN
TO THE CRACK GALLERY.

34:29.630 --> 34:30.892
JESUS.

34:31.000 --> 34:34.026
YOU CAN JUST
TAKE THE VAN--

34:34.140 --> 34:36.335
NO, I'M DRINKING,
YOU HAVE TO DRIVE.

34:36.440 --> 34:39.466
FRIENDS DON'T LET
FRIENDS DRIVE DRUNK.

34:39.570 --> 34:41.401
HOW DO I GET THERE ?

34:41.510 --> 34:44.343
JUST HEAD
TOWARDS DOWNTOWN.

34:46.350 --> 34:48.079
NO, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING ?!

34:48.180 --> 34:49.943
I'M GETTING
ON THE FREEWAY.

34:50.050 --> 34:52.382
STAY OFF
THE FUCKING FREEWAY !

34:52.490 --> 34:54.913
JUST GO,
GET ONTO ALVARADO.

34:55.020 --> 34:56.783
OKAY, CALM DOWN !

34:56.890 --> 34:58.050
I DON'T LIKE
THE FREEWAY.

34:58.160 --> 34:59.855
I HAD AN ACCIDENT
ON THE FREEWAY.

34:59.960 --> 35:01.188
MY FATHER
WAS KILLED.

35:01.300 --> 35:02.597
RIGHT AFTER
WE MOVED HERE.

35:02.700 --> 35:03.689
I'M SORRY.

35:03.800 --> 35:05.028
ON THE WAY
TO THE DODGER GAME.

35:05.130 --> 35:06.392
WE WERE JUST TALKING
AND THEN BAM !

35:06.500 --> 35:08.468
PLOWED INTO THE BACK
OF THIS TRUCK.

35:10.900 --> 35:12.367
I'M REALLY SORRY.

35:12.470 --> 35:16.577
WHEN THE CAR FINALLY
STOPPED MOVING, HE JUST...

35:16.680 --> 35:18.648
WASN'T THERE ANYMORE.

35:22.880 --> 35:24.381
WHAT HAPPENED ?

35:25.990 --> 35:28.083
HE WENT THROUGH
THE WINDSHIELD.

35:28.190 --> 35:30.556
HE NEVER WORE
HIS SEAT BELT.

35:30.660 --> 35:34.221

43:04.680 --> 43:07.399
HOW CAN YOU

43:07.510 --> 43:09.478
BECAUSE YOUR

43:11.990 --> 43:14.185
I MADE ALL THAT UP,
MY FATHER'S NOT DEAD,

43:14.290 --> 43:17.111
HE'S DOING TIME SOMEWHERE

SOMETIMES I WALK
