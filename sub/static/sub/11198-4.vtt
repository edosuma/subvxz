It's SG-1's IDC, sir.
Receiving audio, sir.

On speaker.

<i>(O'Neill) Close quarters withdrawal.

00:25.000 --> 00:28.720
Acknowledged, Colonel.
We'll be ready. Just give us the word.

00:28.800 --> 00:31.000
Watch your friendlies. Safeties off.

00:31.080 --> 00:33.840
Clean targets. Clean backgrounds.

<i>(O'Neill) Teal'c, let's go!
Base, this is it. We're on our way.</i>

00:39.800 --> 00:41.360

01:14.840 --> 01:16.920
Med team, get in there.

01:19.120 --> 01:21.120
Teal'c?

01:22.160 --> 01:24.160
Come on.

01:25.800 --> 01:28.440
<i>- (man) I'm not getting a pulse.
- (Fraiser) Start CPR.</i>

01:28.520 --> 01:32.520
Give me one milligram epi.
Prepare to intubate.

02:57.040 --> 02:59.760
You had us all very worried.

02:59.840 --> 03:01.960
That was not my intention.

03:02.040 --> 03:05.640
The staff blast hit you
directly in the symbiote pouch.

03:05.720 --> 03:09.080
- If you weren't on tretonin...
- I would be dead.

03:10.880 --> 03:13.080
lronic.

03:13.760 --> 03:16.080
Well, you're not out of the woods yet.

03:17.360 --> 03:19.000
Woods?

03:19.080 --> 03:21.360
You have more healing to do.

03:22.280 --> 03:28.080
The staff blast passed through the empty
symbiote pouch and damaged your spine.

03:28.160 --> 03:31.200
In the past, I could have let
your symbiote regenerate it.

03:31.280 --> 03:34.760
With work, you should be able
to make a full recovery.

03:38.640 --> 03:41.680
- Teal'c?
- The Jaffa that wounded me?

03:42.480 --> 03:46.360
Died. His symbiote
was damaged beyond repair.

03:49.240 --> 03:52.880
Look, I know this is hard for you...

03:54.240 --> 03:57.040
but you're very lucky to be alive.

03:58.720 --> 04:01.400
Colonel O'Neill planted my radio
in the underbrush

04:01.480 --> 04:04.440
and began broadcasting
to create a distraction.

04:04.520 --> 04:07.440
The Jaffa fell for this and
half of them left the temple.

04:07.520 --> 04:09.720
We engaged the rest and escaped.

04:09.800 --> 04:12.880
Were you able to ascertain
who these Jaffa were loyal to?

04:12.960 --> 04:16.360
The forehead tattoos were of
various System Lords, mainly Baal.

04:16.440 --> 04:19.640
- Baal?
- His empire has expanded fast.

04:19.720 --> 04:25.280
No surprise to us, since he now controls
the United Alliance of the System Lords,

04:25.360 --> 04:27.960
something we're responsible for.

04:28.040 --> 04:30.400
To level the playing field against Anubis.

04:30.480 --> 04:33.000
So, in a way, we did it to ourselves.

04:33.080 --> 04:35.160
<i>- Sir.
- (Hammond) How is he?</i>

04:35.240 --> 04:39.040
It's gonna be a long road back,
but he should get there.

04:39.120 --> 04:42.560
I boosted his tretonin dosage
to stem off any residual infection.

04:42.640 --> 04:44.920
- Can we see him?
- Yeah.

04:50.240 --> 04:53.360
My son? Why do you ask?

04:53.440 --> 04:57.000
I just thought you'd be sick of
"How're you feeling?" again.

04:57.080 --> 04:58.320
Indeed.

04:58.400 --> 05:00.560
No, I was just thinking about him.

05:00.640 --> 05:04.600
Rya'c is with Bra'tac.
They are attempting to recruit rebel Jaffa.

05:04.680 --> 05:09.120
I have not heard from them,
and do not expect to for some time.

05:09.200 --> 05:11.200
What's with the, uh...?

05:13.520 --> 05:15.480
O'Neill.

05:15.560 --> 05:19.840
I believe his offer of coloured gelatin
was his attempt to sympathise.

05:19.920 --> 05:22.480
Ah, well, he's thoughtful that way.

05:22.560 --> 05:24.600
There's no need.

05:24.680 --> 05:26.680
I blame only myself.

05:27.320 --> 05:30.400
- How is it your fault?
- I fell behind.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
- I was...
- Covering us.

05:38.160 --> 05:39.640
Teal'c?

05:39.720 --> 05:42.960
I wish to be alone, Daniel Jackson.

05:50.400 --> 05:52.400
OK.

05:53.640 --> 05:55.640
OK.

05:59.440 --> 06:02.240
<i>(distant male voice) No! Master!</i>

06:17.120 --> 06:19.480
<i>(Carter) So they fly
halfway across the galaxy,</i>

06:19.560 --> 06:21.720
in a highly advanced spaceship,

06:21.800 --> 06:24.680
but don't use their technology
to take over the planet.

06:24.760 --> 06:28.120
You know what their weakness
turned out to be? Water.

06:28.200 --> 06:32.800
Why go to all the trouble to invade
a planet that's two-thirds water?

06:32.880 --> 06:35.200
Not to mention the rain!

06:35.280 --> 06:38.120
Why do you watch those movies?
All you do is cut 'em up.

06:38.200 --> 06:45.320
Don't you occasionally like to see if
they're getting it anywhere close to right?

06:45.840 --> 06:47.440
Hello?!

06:47.520 --> 06:50.360
- What?
- Are you OK?

06:50.440 --> 06:52.560
Ever feel you forgot something important?

06:52.640 --> 06:55.840
- What do you mean?
- Well...

06:55.920 --> 06:59.440
I can remember almost everything
from before I died,

06:59.520 --> 07:02.360
but I can't remember anything
from when I was ascended.

07:02.440 --> 07:04.920
Lately something's been nagging at me.

07:05.000 --> 07:09.000
Something specific.
I just can't pin it down.

07:09.960 --> 07:11.600
Very good, Teal'c.

07:11.680 --> 07:13.680
OK, you're done.

07:16.520 --> 07:18.320
Teal'c!

07:26.000 --> 07:30.760
- Looks like you're doing better.
- There is such a thing as overdoing it.

07:32.080 --> 07:36.440
Teal'c, it is possible to aggravate
your condition by pushing too hard.

07:41.520 --> 07:43.520
Leave me be.

07:44.880 --> 07:48.320
<i>(recalls male voice) No! Master!</i>

07:52.080 --> 07:54.400
Daniel?

07:55.760 --> 07:58.560
Any technical anomalies
during an incoming wormhole

07:58.640 --> 08:03.720
are noted in this box and cross-referenced
and detailed here. It's pretty dry.

08:03.800 --> 08:07.520
- The mission files cover points of interest.
- I've been over those.

08:07.600 --> 08:11.200
- If I knew what you were looking for...
- We wouldn't be doing this.

08:11.280 --> 08:13.280
Why do you think the answer's here?

08:13.360 --> 08:16.560
I have a feeling it has something
to do with an incoming wormhole.

08:16.640 --> 08:20.840
I was hoping that looking at some of
this stuff might jog my memory somehow.

08:20.920 --> 08:23.440
It must be tough.

08:23.520 --> 08:28.360
The hardest part is not knowing
whether or not I chose to be here like this.

08:28.440 --> 08:32.240
Whether I could be doing
more good if I was still...

08:32.320 --> 08:34.240
Ascended?

08:34.320 --> 08:36.480
Yeah.

08:39.880 --> 08:44.560
Well, this should be everything
you need. Good luck.

08:44.640 --> 08:46.640
Thanks.

08:59.120 --> 09:01.520
That's the last of
the physical examination.

09:01.600 --> 09:06.520
You have just lifted and pulled more
weight than anyone on this base ever has.

09:06.600 --> 09:09.680
Alien technology notwithstanding.

09:14.160 --> 09:15.960
Teal'c?

09:16.040 --> 09:18.840
I'm clearing you for active duty.

09:21.280 --> 09:23.480
I am not ready.

09:34.440 --> 09:38.040
- Still nothing?
- I've broadened my search

09:38.120 --> 09:41.840
to include outgoing wormholes
and unauthorised activations.

09:41.920 --> 09:45.160
I still have no idea what I'm looking for.

09:45.240 --> 09:49.440
Maybe if you stop thinking about it
it'll come to you.

09:51.760 --> 09:53.600
Take a break.

09:53.680 --> 09:56.280
Fraiser says Teal'c needs a little pep talk.

09:56.360 --> 09:59.040
I've been practising in front of a mirror.

09:59.120 --> 10:01.400
- Not peppy enough?
- Not really.

10:09.360 --> 10:11.360
Don't give me the eyebrow.

10:11.440 --> 10:16.920
Something's bothering you. Something
was bothering you before this injury.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.480
- We're pretty sure we know what it is.
- Then there is no mystery.

10:20.560 --> 10:23.440
Yeah, but the point is,
you have to talk about it.

10:26.280 --> 10:31.560
<i>OK, you don't have to talk about it,
but you'll feel better if you do.</i>

10:33.680 --> 10:37.640
You know, forget that crap.
I'm your commanding officer.

10:37.720 --> 10:40.840
And you must be kept informed
of my fitness.

10:40.920 --> 10:44.280
Fraiser says you're ready for duty now.
Is that true?

10:45.280 --> 10:47.680
I have been dishonest with you.

10:47.760 --> 10:48.880
Oh?

10:48.960 --> 10:53.280
It is unacceptable. All Jaffa children
know this without being told.

10:53.360 --> 10:57.480
They are born with the knowledge.
It will not be tolerated.

10:58.520 --> 11:01.120
- What?
- Kek.

11:03.840 --> 11:07.240
- "Death." You mean "death"?
- Weakness.

11:08.560 --> 11:12.440
We use one word for both. For if one
is weak, one may as well be dead.

11:13.920 --> 11:16.440
You're talking about the tretonin.

11:16.520 --> 11:20.560
I believed it to be the answer of liberation
for all Jaffa from the Goa'uld

11:20.640 --> 11:22.640
and the reliance on symbiotes.

11:22.720 --> 11:25.440
But as soon as I began to take it
things changed.

11:25.520 --> 11:28.480
I felt my capability
was being compromised.

11:28.560 --> 11:35.000
But I said nothing, hoping the effects were
temporary and my strength would return.

11:35.080 --> 11:37.240
It did not.

11:38.880 --> 11:40.360
OK...

11:40.440 --> 11:46.120
- Forgive me, O'Neill. I should have...
- No. There's nothing to forgive.

11:47.920 --> 11:53.080
You're still twice as strong as I'll ever be,
and you've got two good knees.

11:53.160 --> 11:56.200
Then the answer to your question is no.

11:56.280 --> 11:59.080
I do not feel that I am fit for duty.

11:59.160 --> 12:01.200
OK.

12:01.280 --> 12:03.840
I can accept that. For now.

12:18.080 --> 12:21.400
- Not exactly peppy.
- What did you want me to say to the guy?

12:21.480 --> 12:24.280
He's lost his confidence.
He wants you to reinstill some.

12:24.360 --> 12:28.480
If he really has lost his mojo,
nothing I can say will get it back for him.

12:28.560 --> 12:33.200
- It's all in his head.
- If he doesn't think he's ready, he's not.

12:43.520 --> 12:47.280
Without a symbiote,
kelno'reem is unnecessary.

12:47.360 --> 12:50.080
- I have discontinued the practice.
- Yeah.

12:50.160 --> 12:53.920
<i>I know you don't need to kelno'reem
any more, but just indulge me.</i>

12:54.000 --> 12:57.080
Humans meditate even though
they still require REM sleep.

12:57.160 --> 13:00.400
- I think this thing I can't remember...
- Daniel Jackson.

13:00.480 --> 13:04.840
For a successful kelno'reem, there is
one element required above all others.

13:04.920 --> 13:07.560
- What?
- Silence.

13:08.120 --> 13:10.160
Right.

13:19.240 --> 13:21.720
<i>(recalls male voice) No! Master!</i>

13:21.800 --> 13:23.560
<i>Master, no!</i>

13:23.640 --> 13:27.040
<i>(sobbing) Master! No, master!</i>

13:40.240 --> 13:42.040
Kree! Ha'shak!

13:44.720 --> 13:46.600
Leave him alone.

13:48.880 --> 13:51.720
No! Master!

13:51.800 --> 13:53.640
<i>Master, no!</i>

13:53.720 --> 13:56.920
<i>Master! No, master!</i>

13:59.200 --> 14:02.000
- Rya'c?
- Yeah.

14:02.080 --> 14:04.720
Yeah, I saw him and Bra'tac.

14:04.800 --> 14:06.800
I think they're in danger.

14:06.960 --> 14:10.120
Are you familiar with
the ambush of Kresh'ta?

14:10.200 --> 14:12.400
The Jaffa rebel tribes.
I read the report.

14:12.480 --> 14:15.640
106 warriors slaughtered.
Only you and Bra'tac survived.

14:15.720 --> 14:19.840
You sustained both of your lives
by passing a symbiote between you.

14:19.920 --> 14:23.600
There is something
that is not in the report.

14:24.440 --> 14:27.640
As I lay near death, I began to dream.

14:29.080 --> 14:32.200
You used your abilities and appeared
to me in that dream.

14:34.600 --> 14:37.800
- I did?
- Indeed.

14:37.880 --> 14:42.760
When I had recovered you appeared to me
again, and that is when I knew.

14:44.040 --> 14:47.640
You had stayed with me
and watched over me for three days.

14:47.720 --> 14:51.960
And that is the reason I am eternally
grateful to you, Daniel Jackson.

14:52.040 --> 14:56.200
And why I wholeheartedly
believe you concerning Rya'c.

14:56.280 --> 14:59.800
- So you believe me too?
- The things I've heard sitting here?!

14:59.880 --> 15:02.240
If this happened before
you retook human form,

15:02.320 --> 15:06.200
then whatever supply of tretonin
Bra'tac had would be depleted by now.

15:06.280 --> 15:08.520
That is why we must act immediately.

15:08.600 --> 15:11.600
Daniel, you thought all this
had to do with gate records.

15:11.680 --> 15:14.080
Perhaps you knew to look for a location.

15:14.160 --> 15:17.440
I've been through those records.
I haven't found anything.

15:17.520 --> 15:20.800
Teal'c, is there anything familiar
about the planet?

15:20.880 --> 15:22.880
There is not.

15:23.880 --> 15:27.880
General Hammond, I request
that we send for Rak'nor immediately.

15:27.960 --> 15:30.360
<i>- Do it.
- (Carter) Yes, sir.</i>

16:12.280 --> 16:14.640
You grow more and more weak each day.

16:14.720 --> 16:17.320
You worry too much for me, Rya'c.

16:17.400 --> 16:19.400
Tend to your own labour.

16:25.480 --> 16:27.480
A kek ha'shak! Ya duru!

16:45.280 --> 16:47.920
If you do not work,

16:48.000 --> 16:50.000
you will die.

16:51.800 --> 16:54.600
They do not work hard enough.

16:54.680 --> 16:59.120
No rescue is forthcoming...
and your supply of tretonin runs low.

16:59.200 --> 17:01.360
Rya'c!

17:01.440 --> 17:02.600
Kree-ga!

17:05.960 --> 17:11.920
We will not be able to maintain
our workload. They will execute us next.

17:12.000 --> 17:12.960
Kree!

17:17.079 --> 17:18.480
Kek.

17:28.480 --> 17:33.840
Have faith. I will ration
my tretonin, until a rescue.

17:41.840 --> 17:43.080
Kek.

17:48.760 --> 17:50.760
Kol'va!

18:08.880 --> 18:10.880
Is any of this familiar to you?

18:10.960 --> 18:15.480
A planet with two moons, a naqahdah
refinery near some sort of dry dock

18:15.560 --> 18:17.680
with a mother ship under construction?

18:17.760 --> 18:20.760
I know the planet of which you describe.
Erebus.

18:20.840 --> 18:25.240
According to Greek mythology,
Erebus is where condemned souls pass.

18:25.320 --> 18:29.400
It is aptly named. The planet is used
for the construction of Ha'tak vessels

18:29.480 --> 18:32.000
and the purification
of naqahdah to build them.

18:32.080 --> 18:34.080
Only Jaffa prisoner labour is used.

18:34.160 --> 18:37.800
They can withstand the heat and
toxic gases of the blast furnaces

18:37.880 --> 18:40.160
fed by underground volcanic systems.

18:40.240 --> 18:44.200
- Eventually, even the Jaffa succumb.
- I am aware of such places.

18:44.280 --> 18:48.720
Jaffa prisoners, unwilling to serve their
Goa'uld masters, are worked to death.

18:48.800 --> 18:52.000
The perfect place to recruit rebels.
Something's gone wrong.

18:52.080 --> 18:54.120
The planet was recently taken by Baal.

18:54.200 --> 18:57.680
If Bra'tac and Rya'c were there then,
perhaps they were trapped.

18:57.760 --> 18:59.840
- Then they are lost.
- Why?

18:59.920 --> 19:02.600
- The Stargate on Erebus is impenetrable.
- How so?

19:02.680 --> 19:07.760
A force field much like your iris blocks it,
making rescue through it impossible.

19:07.840 --> 19:09.640
Someone must get through.

19:09.720 --> 19:12.800
We believe a signal is used
to power down the force field.

19:12.880 --> 19:15.760
But we have no way of knowing
what that signal is.

19:18.480 --> 19:19.640
Now!

19:35.760 --> 19:37.080
<i>(beeps)</i>

19:52.560 --> 19:54.760
I was there. I saw the whole thing happen.

19:54.840 --> 19:59.240
Nothing I could do - just watch,
powerless to interfere.

20:00.640 --> 20:03.480
- Come on, it has to be there.
- Just give me a minute.

20:03.560 --> 20:07.840
I never thought of checking
the Alpha site gate records.

20:07.920 --> 20:11.080
A coded energy signal
was received and recorded

20:11.160 --> 20:13.200
through the gate three months ago.

20:13.280 --> 20:16.320
No one was able to determine
its origin or its purpose.

20:16.400 --> 20:19.920
That is the deactivation code Bra'tac sent
before he was captured.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.480
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

20:21.560 --> 20:25.920
I can synthesise this. If it is the code,
I can get us through the gate.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.480
And I can provide details of their defences
and the lay of the land.

20:34.280 --> 20:35.960
O'Neill.

20:36.960 --> 20:40.680
I must tell you that I believe
I may be a liability on this mission.

20:40.760 --> 20:42.360
I don't.

20:42.440 --> 20:45.680
If I should die,
it is my wish that you watch over Rya'c.

20:46.720 --> 20:50.160
Let's see it doesn't come to that, all right?

20:50.240 --> 20:53.840
<i>(technician over PA)
Chevron six encoded.</i>

20:57.840 --> 21:00.560
<i>- It's his son.
- Chevron seven locked.</i>

21:04.440 --> 21:06.840
All right, let's do this.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.000
Sending signal now.

21:30.200 --> 21:31.840
Clear.

21:31.920 --> 21:34.120
OK, so... that happened.

21:35.040 --> 21:39.360
SG-3, secure these guys,
then establish your perimeter.

21:39.440 --> 21:41.440
Daniel.

22:11.320 --> 22:13.760
Master Bra'tac.

22:13.840 --> 22:16.800
It is difficult to ration
that which you do not have.

22:18.320 --> 22:21.720
- If only you had not seen.
- I have seen.

22:22.720 --> 22:25.960
Now tell me the truth. I'm not a child.

22:27.720 --> 22:29.720
The tretonin is gone.

22:30.640 --> 22:35.000
Then you will die, and all your words
of faith will have been for nothing.

22:35.080 --> 22:38.080
No, Rya'c, not for nothing. For you!

22:39.800 --> 22:41.640
You might survive.

22:43.960 --> 22:46.640
How long can you live without tretonin?

22:47.640 --> 22:49.640
As long as I have to.

23:20.960 --> 23:22.960
Penhall.

23:24.600 --> 23:26.800
Trade. Give me that thing.

23:31.520 --> 23:34.080
No sign of Bra'tac.

23:36.560 --> 23:38.960
Wait a minute. I've got Rya'c.

23:47.000 --> 23:51.480
If we eliminate that guard position,
we can create a blind spot.

24:00.200 --> 24:03.320
Infiltration is the best option, O'Neill.

24:05.960 --> 24:08.480
All right, it'll be dark in an hour.

24:08.560 --> 24:11.480
Everybody, get comfortable.

24:31.200 --> 24:33.200
Go.

24:48.360 --> 24:50.600
<i>- They're in.
- (commander, via earpiece) Jaffa, hol!</i>

24:52.480 --> 24:55.400
<i>- Jaffa!
- Come on, come on.</i>

24:58.840 --> 25:00.080
<i>Rin nok!</i>

25:00.160 --> 25:02.840
- What's this?
- He's dressing the warrior down.

25:02.920 --> 25:06.240
"Do the bidding of Baal. Shut up."

25:06.320 --> 25:09.440
- "Shut up"?!
- I'm paraphrasing.

25:09.520 --> 25:12.720
<i>Kel mar tokeem. Tal ma kree.</i>

25:13.560 --> 25:15.040
<i>Meg tal.</i>

25:15.120 --> 25:19.320
"You're poisoned. You're cursed by
the wearer of horns. You're sloppy."

25:19.400 --> 25:22.520
<i>- Oracca aseemu.
- Oh, for crying out loud!</i>

25:24.560 --> 25:26.640
<i>- Hol mel!
- Damn it.</i>

25:26.720 --> 25:29.440
- I think they've been made.
- Just hold on.

25:49.360 --> 25:51.680
- Rya'c.
- Father.

25:51.760 --> 25:56.280
I'm sorry. Master Bra'tac said
you would come, but I did not believe.

25:56.360 --> 26:01.040
- How is he?
- He still lives, but I fear not for long.

26:02.760 --> 26:05.160
Tek matte.

26:06.600 --> 26:08.960
Old friend.

26:11.320 --> 26:14.160
- Rak'nor.
- Tek matte, Master Bra'tac.

26:16.080 --> 26:18.560
There is enough for both of us.

26:23.960 --> 26:26.040
You cannot hide here for long.

26:26.120 --> 26:28.720
It will take time for him
to regain his strength.

26:28.800 --> 26:32.640
- Then we will carry him.
- We came to take you and Bra'tac away.

26:33.720 --> 26:36.880
What about them?
What about all the others?

26:36.960 --> 26:39.280
There are too many.

26:39.920 --> 26:42.320
- They can fight.
- And they will die.

26:42.800 --> 26:45.720
If they stay, they will die.

26:54.680 --> 26:58.520
Teal'c! You've been made.
Get outta there. Get outta there!

26:58.600 --> 27:00.840
<i>Teal'c!</i>

27:05.480 --> 27:06.800
Kree chok!

27:17.400 --> 27:19.840
Hold your fire. Hold your fire!

27:19.920 --> 27:22.720
<i>(Jaffa commander shouting orders)</i>

27:33.720 --> 27:35.720
<i>(whip lashing)</i>

27:44.920 --> 27:46.920
<i>(man groaning)</i>

27:49.720 --> 27:52.360
- Sir.
- Just hold your position.

27:53.560 --> 27:55.560
<i>(whip lashing/man groaning)</i>

27:57.760 --> 28:02.680
- We're just gonna sit here?
- Yes! We're just gonna sit here.

28:02.760 --> 28:05.360
Till we can find another way in.

28:32.120 --> 28:34.720
Rya'c. You are still alive.

28:36.040 --> 28:38.760
Yes, Father.

28:38.840 --> 28:40.920
That is all that matters.

28:42.600 --> 28:44.800
What of Bra'tac?

28:45.680 --> 28:48.960
The tretonin has helped.

28:49.040 --> 28:51.840
What of you, Father? Can you walk?

28:53.440 --> 28:55.720
Not at the moment.

28:57.640 --> 28:59.800
You must.

28:59.880 --> 29:02.720
Those who cannot work are killed.

29:02.800 --> 29:07.880
You must not lose your faith, Rya'c.
Rak'nor and I did not come alone.

29:10.960 --> 29:14.000
Even now, a rescue is under way.

29:21.000 --> 29:25.160
Search patrol went off in that direction,
heading for the Stargate.

29:25.240 --> 29:29.240
They don't believe Teal'c and Rak'nor
were working alone.

29:29.320 --> 29:33.440
- This is my fault.
- How's that?

29:33.520 --> 29:36.320
I should have done something
when I had the chance.

29:36.400 --> 29:38.520
When I had the power.

29:39.400 --> 29:44.840
I think we've already established
that wouldn't have worked out either.

29:44.920 --> 29:47.120
Nope, it's time for plan B.

29:48.080 --> 29:52.120
- We have a plan B?
- No, but it's time for one.

29:52.200 --> 29:56.360
We've already determined
there are too many guards for us.

29:56.440 --> 29:59.080
We need a distraction.

30:00.320 --> 30:03.560
- Grenades?
- Think bigger.

30:03.960 --> 30:06.040
Claymores?

30:08.840 --> 30:11.160
Much bigger.

30:21.160 --> 30:23.360
<i>(footsteps approaching)</i>

30:46.360 --> 30:49.360
Major, target TRP-1 .

30:57.240 --> 30:59.720
His strength still grows.

31:00.640 --> 31:02.720
Good.

31:02.800 --> 31:06.200
Rya'c, you and Rak'nor
must spread the word.

31:06.280 --> 31:11.240
If we wish for our rescue to be successful,
the others must be prepared to fight.

31:11.320 --> 31:15.280
- How will they know when?
- When the time is right they will know.

31:15.360 --> 31:17.080
Indeed.

31:18.080 --> 31:20.440
Can you fight?

31:21.240 --> 31:25.120
- I am not the Jaffa I once was.
- No!

31:25.200 --> 31:26.960
<i>- (Teal'c) Rya'c...
- (Rya'c) No.</i>

31:27.040 --> 31:29.880
You are Teal'c.
There is no greater warrior.

31:29.960 --> 31:32.560
Rya'c!

31:32.640 --> 31:36.800
I am... weak.

31:37.720 --> 31:39.640
No... Father, please.

31:39.720 --> 31:42.000
Rya'c!

31:42.080 --> 31:45.880
No matter what...
you must survive.

31:45.960 --> 31:48.040
You must survive.

31:50.120 --> 31:52.880
Or I have come for nothing.

31:55.080 --> 31:56.880
Now go.

32:15.240 --> 32:19.880
Once this panel goes it'll take seconds
for the anti-gravity platform to shut down.

32:36.360 --> 32:38.360
It has been difficult.

32:39.280 --> 32:42.040
For both of us.

32:42.120 --> 32:44.120
You are feeling better.

32:45.840 --> 32:48.640
You will not be rid of me so easily.

32:50.240 --> 32:53.640
When the time comes
I will be ready, old friend.

32:53.720 --> 32:56.320
As will I.

32:56.400 --> 32:58.400
I am not so sure.

33:00.040 --> 33:05.120
This tretonin seems to have
had an effect on your memory.

33:05.200 --> 33:07.480
Why would you say such a thing?

33:07.560 --> 33:12.600
You've forgotten that a warrior's strength
comes from his heart and his mind.

33:14.800 --> 33:18.760
You have had a physical advantage
over me for a long time,

33:18.840 --> 33:23.520
and yet I have never
lost a sparring match to you.

33:23.600 --> 33:28.600
Because for years, old man,
I have let you win.

33:33.920 --> 33:35.560
Better.

33:36.520 --> 33:37.600
<i>(chuckles)</i>

33:37.680 --> 33:39.680
Much better.

34:00.040 --> 34:02.080
<i>(footsteps approaching)</i>

34:10.199 --> 34:12.199
This could be a problem.

34:33.719 --> 34:35.920
This is not your work station.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.400
Take him.

34:55.800 --> 34:59.240
If you do not work, then you will die!

34:59.320 --> 35:02.560
This one does not know
where his work station is.

35:06.480 --> 35:10.000
But he is young... and still able to work.

35:15.160 --> 35:17.240
You dare to speak to me?

35:18.480 --> 35:20.960
Only to ask that I take his place.

35:24.480 --> 35:26.280
So be it.

35:28.560 --> 35:30.720
No! No!

35:40.640 --> 35:42.640
You are barely able to stand.

35:42.720 --> 35:46.920
You would not have lasted another day.
It was a good trade.

35:52.080 --> 35:55.880
<i>- (O'Neill) Carter, what's the hold-up?
- We're a go in 30 seconds, sir.</i>

35:55.960 --> 35:58.640
Assume we do not have 30 seconds.

36:02.120 --> 36:05.920
You were once the first prime of Apophis.

36:06.000 --> 36:09.560
Now you're nothing
but a weak, pathetic shol'va.

36:12.120 --> 36:14.120
<i>(Bra'tac) Do not look away.</i>

36:14.200 --> 36:16.960
Be strong for him.

36:17.040 --> 36:23.000
What better way for Teal'c to die than
to be looking upon the face of his son?

36:31.960 --> 36:32.720
<i>(alarm)</i>

36:32.800 --> 36:34.800
<i>(explosion)</i>

37:03.240 --> 37:05.240
<i>(powering down)</i>

37:08.400 --> 37:10.800
<i>(horn sounds)</i>

37:17.000 --> 37:19.440
Kree! Trey lon tonok!

37:31.760 --> 37:33.160
Fire!

37:41.320 --> 37:44.400
Take them now!

38:04.920 --> 38:07.200
Come on, boys, have at 'em.

38:50.840 --> 38:52.360
Wait!

39:14.080 --> 39:16.080
Father!

39:20.880 --> 39:22.880
<i>(Stargate alarm)</i>

39:29.920 --> 39:31.480
Welcome back, SG-1 .

39:31.560 --> 39:35.680
The camp has been liberated. All the
prisoners relocated to the Alpha site.

39:35.760 --> 39:37.960
They are anxious to join the rebellion.

39:38.040 --> 39:41.240
Then my mission has been a success.

39:41.920 --> 39:46.880
Hammond of Texas,
I find myself once more in your debt.

39:47.640 --> 39:50.160
I think it's Dr Jackson you owe
on this one.

39:52.160 --> 39:54.480
Indeed.

40:01.720 --> 40:08.360
Kelno'reem is unnecessary.
Although it does make me feel... better.

40:11.880 --> 40:18.080
Colonel O'Neill has officially informed me
that I have my "mojo" back.

40:20.200 --> 40:23.040
<i>I guess I should be thanking you, actually.</i>

40:23.120 --> 40:26.800
You see, I used to...
I used to feel like I didn't belong.

40:26.880 --> 40:28.880
Anywhere, really.

40:30.880 --> 40:34.080
I think I thought that this ascension
thing would change that.

40:34.160 --> 40:39.400
Now I'm realising that
the sacrifices were far too great...

40:40.960 --> 40:44.520
and my life here is too important
to just leave behind.

40:44.600 --> 40:47.440
I guess what I'm trying to say is that...

40:47.520 --> 40:52.360
for the first time in my life
I feel like I'm a part of something.

40:53.360 --> 40:55.360
Something important.

40:56.280 --> 40:58.680
As do I.
