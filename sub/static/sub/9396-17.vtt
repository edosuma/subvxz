<i>Previously on</i> One Tree Hill:

00:03.636 --> 00:05.035
-Take off the wedding ring.
-What?

00:05.105 --> 00:07.665
-Let them think you're a couple.
-But we're not a couple.

00:07.741 --> 00:09.003
<i>Are you a couple in real life?</i>

00:09.075 --> 00:10.975
<i>-Actually--</i>
<i>-You know, the music never lies.</i>

00:11.044 --> 00:13.069
Somebody bashed in
my car windshield last night.

00:13.146 --> 00:15.239
I mean, could things get any worse?

00:17.917 --> 00:19.282
You wanna ask me that again?

00:19.352 --> 00:21.320
I fell in love with Keith for real.

00:21.388 --> 00:23.413
I want him to know who you really are.

00:24.691 --> 00:27.159
I'm sorry. She left.

00:30.730 --> 00:31.890
I didn't do anything.

00:31.965 --> 00:33.762
You sick bastard.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.628
I found out about your arrangement
and I went to Jules.

00:36.703 --> 00:38.694
And I threatened to tell the truth.

00:38.772 --> 00:40.171
My dad got that job...

00:40.240 --> 00:41.571
in California.

00:41.641 --> 00:43.541
We're moving next week.

00:43.610 --> 00:45.077
What are we gonna do?

00:45.145 --> 00:46.578
<i>I don't want to go.</i>

00:53.253 --> 00:54.379
What are you doing here?

00:54.454 --> 00:56.445
Go get Haley. She's your wife.

01:41.868 --> 01:43.995
<i>Charles Bukowski once wrote.:</i>

01:44.671 --> 01:47.834
<i>''There will always be something</i>
<i>to ruin our lives.</i>

01:47.907 --> 01:51.001
<i>''It all depends on what</i>

01:52.245 --> 01:55.112
<i>''We are always ripe</i>

01:55.648 --> 01:58.947
Well, well, well. Isn't this the picture
of a perfect family?

02:00.019 --> 02:01.543
What are you doing here, Nicki?

02:01.621 --> 02:04.283
You mean, why am I not in Seattle? Right.

02:04.591 --> 02:06.752
Some skank writes
a random city on a napkin...

02:06.826 --> 02:08.794
and I catch the first flight out.

02:08.862 --> 02:11.126
No. We had a court hearing
a few weeks ago...

02:11.197 --> 02:13.859
and imagine my surprise
when you didn't show up.

02:13.933 --> 02:17.369
I guess you didn't have
your mail forwarded to Seattle.

02:17.537 --> 02:19.095
So since you didn't show...

02:19.172 --> 02:21.470
the judge granted me
sole custody of my daughter...

02:21.541 --> 02:25.068
which, for the brunette-impaired, means
that Jenny comes home to Mommy.

02:25.712 --> 02:27.111
You're lying.

02:27.180 --> 02:28.909
That's cute. She talks for you.

02:29.182 --> 02:31.742
But I have a feeling that
a judge would have a problem...

02:31.818 --> 02:36.346
awarding custody to a high-school dropout
who kidnapped his baby anyway.

02:36.556 --> 02:39.491
How do judges feel about women
who abandon their children?

02:39.559 --> 02:42.653
I don't know.
There was no one in court to ask.

02:42.762 --> 02:45.230
So she's mine now. Hand her over.

02:45.465 --> 02:48.525
Forget it. She'll never be yours.

02:49.335 --> 02:50.768
I don't even believe you anyway.

02:50.837 --> 02:53.601
You can not believe me all the way to jail
if you want.

02:53.673 --> 02:55.732
She fights for you, too.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.202
Fine.

02:59.646 --> 03:01.705
We'll let the police deal with it.

03:03.483 --> 03:04.916
See you soon, bunny.

03:25.638 --> 03:26.900
Don't go.

03:30.376 --> 03:32.344
I just needed to say it.

03:33.980 --> 03:35.607
You have to stay.

03:36.382 --> 03:39.545
We're finally friends again,
and now I'm leaving.

03:46.392 --> 03:49.589
I really liked being
the girl behind the red door.

04:15.655 --> 04:16.713
Mom.

04:18.257 --> 04:19.781
What are you doing here?

04:19.858 --> 04:21.656
I was waiting for Keith.

04:22.462 --> 04:23.986
He never came home?

04:24.330 --> 04:25.695
I guess not.

04:26.933 --> 04:29.458
Yeah, he wasn't
at Jules' apartment either.

04:29.535 --> 04:31.332
Any idea where else he might be?

04:32.438 --> 04:36.169
If I had two guesses,
they'd both be at a bar getting drunk.

04:37.744 --> 04:40.269
Why didn't you just tell me
what was going on?

04:40.346 --> 04:41.643
'Cause I knew you'd tell Keith.

04:42.982 --> 04:45.746
And I thought moving in with Dan...

04:45.885 --> 04:49.412
was the only way to get him
to leave Keith alone.

04:49.589 --> 04:51.113
You should have told me.

04:51.457 --> 04:53.015
I'm sorry I hurt you.

04:55.328 --> 04:57.728
You have no idea how hard this has been.

04:59.132 --> 05:00.656
I have an idea.

05:02.035 --> 05:05.664
So how did you find out
about Dan's arrangement with Jules?

05:05.738 --> 05:07.501
What arrangement with Jules?

05:09.142 --> 05:10.507
What arrangement?

05:12.178 --> 05:14.942
Dan paid Jules to be with you.

05:16.482 --> 05:19.508
So both of you knew about it
and you said nothing?

05:25.325 --> 05:27.259
Keith, wait.

05:28.928 --> 05:30.520
Let's talk about this.

05:31.164 --> 05:34.725
Everyone I thought I cared about
lied to me.

05:36.202 --> 05:38.295
What's there to talk about?

06:09.702 --> 06:12.136
I'm not gonna need
a ride home after school.

06:12.205 --> 06:14.230
I'm going to dinner with Peyton.

06:14.807 --> 06:16.240
How romantic.

06:16.309 --> 06:19.039
Is Velma picking you up
in the Mystery Machine?

06:19.979 --> 06:21.776
She's not gay, Felix.

06:21.848 --> 06:23.748
Everyone at school thinks she is.

06:23.883 --> 06:27.046
Yeah, because you painted ''dyke''
on her locker!

06:30.790 --> 06:32.485
Practically wrote itself.

06:32.725 --> 06:34.352
-That's not funny.
-Look, whatever.

06:34.427 --> 06:36.554
She's always jealous of me
hanging around Brooke.

06:36.629 --> 06:39.359
-And you know she has a crush on you.
-That's not true.

06:39.432 --> 06:41.297
Why did we leave our last school, Anna?

06:41.367 --> 06:43.858
Because once the rumors started,
we couldn't stop them.

06:43.936 --> 06:46.302
And no one cared if they weren't true.

06:46.372 --> 06:48.237
You cried every day, remember?

06:48.408 --> 06:50.273
Yes, Felix, I remember.

06:50.510 --> 06:52.444
And I wasn't gonna let that happen again.

06:52.512 --> 06:54.639
I knew if I painted ''dyke''
on Peyton's locker...

06:54.714 --> 06:56.272
everyone would think she was gay.

06:56.349 --> 06:58.340
That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

06:58.418 --> 06:59.817
I was friends with her.

06:59.886 --> 07:03.117
Really? I haven't seen you guys
hanging out as much since then.

07:04.690 --> 07:07.659
You see, Anna? You're so predictable.

07:10.430 --> 07:13.524
One well-placed rumor,
and you go running off scared.

07:13.966 --> 07:15.297
Besides...

07:17.170 --> 07:18.933
better her than you.

07:37.056 --> 07:39.081
Little formal for work, don't you think?

07:40.626 --> 07:42.218
Did you set me up?

07:44.030 --> 07:46.590
Jules, the wedding,
was it just all a big lie?

07:46.966 --> 07:49.127
What? Of course not.

07:50.236 --> 07:53.399
We're brothers, Keith.
I would never do anything to hurt you.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.668
Especially with the woman
you're gonna marry.

07:59.178 --> 08:02.375
I'm sorry. I can't keep going.
It's just too good.

08:02.982 --> 08:04.313
What can I say?

08:05.184 --> 08:06.776
Of course I set you up.

08:07.553 --> 08:08.747
How could you do that?

08:08.821 --> 08:11.517
I just pictured you screwing
my wife over and over again...

08:11.591 --> 08:15.220
thought about the heart attack it gave me,
and after that, it was easy.

08:15.294 --> 08:16.488
Where is she?

08:17.296 --> 08:18.695
I honestly don't know.

08:21.300 --> 08:24.030
Check in the yellow pages
under ''W'' for whore.

08:24.504 --> 08:27.564
No, wait. She's not that bright.
You better check under ''H.''

08:42.255 --> 08:43.654
Get off him.

08:43.856 --> 08:45.016
Come on.

08:47.460 --> 08:48.620
Hey, calm down, man.

08:48.694 --> 08:50.059
Get off me.

08:55.067 --> 08:57.160
By the way, you're fired, too.

08:57.937 --> 08:59.564
Do you believe that guy?

09:07.046 --> 09:08.673
Congratulations, Dan.

09:10.216 --> 09:12.343
I got nothing left to lose.

09:13.586 --> 09:14.848
But you do.

09:16.322 --> 09:17.812
Remember that.

09:29.201 --> 09:32.500
I can't believe this is almost
our last time walking to class together.

09:32.572 --> 09:35.370
I can't believe I'm getting weepy
about walking to class.

09:35.441 --> 09:39.104
I feel like somebody needs to yell out,
''Dead girl walking.''

09:40.446 --> 09:42.107
Band geek staring.

09:43.916 --> 09:45.042
God.

09:45.284 --> 09:49.345
I can't imagine what it would be like
to not have you to talk to every day.

09:49.722 --> 09:53.681
I'm gonna get you a webcam.
That way it'll be like you're living with me.

09:55.795 --> 09:59.231
Or I could just live with you.

10:00.700 --> 10:02.668
-You could.
-Yeah.

10:03.235 --> 10:05.328
You can. You spend most of your time
at my house anyway.

10:05.404 --> 10:07.201
This is such a good idea. I'm so excited.

10:07.273 --> 10:09.104
I'm gonna go find a phone
and call my mom.

10:09.175 --> 10:10.904
Why not just use your cell?

10:11.611 --> 10:13.875
My parents put me on
that pay-as-you-go plan.

10:13.946 --> 10:15.470
I haven't paid.

10:16.315 --> 10:17.543
Then go.

10:18.017 --> 10:19.041
Go!

10:23.389 --> 10:26.153
Hi. I have to tell you something.

10:26.225 --> 10:28.819
AII right, tell me on the way to class.
I'm running late.

10:28.894 --> 10:31.658
-It's gonna upset you.
-That seems to be the trend this week.

10:31.731 --> 10:34.666
Are you leaving town
or here to steal a baby?

10:35.968 --> 10:38.698
Felix is the one
who spray-painted your locker.

10:41.040 --> 10:43.474
You know, I'm really not all that surprised.

10:43.576 --> 10:46.067
I thought I saw him
goose-stepping down the hall.

10:46.379 --> 10:47.846
I'm really sorry.

10:48.180 --> 10:51.274
Anna, you're not the one
who owes me an apology.

10:52.618 --> 10:55.781
I wouldn't hold your breath.
Felix isn't the remorseful type.

10:56.288 --> 10:58.313
He owes you an apology, too.

10:58.724 --> 11:01.420
He might have spray-painted ''dyke''
on my locker...

11:01.494 --> 11:03.359
but he was talking about you.

11:03.996 --> 11:06.021
He might not know that, but you do.

11:07.133 --> 11:08.259
I know.

11:37.963 --> 11:39.123
Haley, come on already.

11:39.198 --> 11:41.325
We're gonna be late
for our own wedding reception.

11:41.400 --> 11:43.095
Okay, just give me two more minutes.

11:43.169 --> 11:45.399
Babe, this shower massager
has three speeds.

11:45.471 --> 11:47.666
Yeah, and you have one: slow.

11:48.307 --> 11:50.741
Quit complaining. I need the extra time.

11:50.810 --> 11:53.244
Besides, people expect
the bride to look beautiful.

11:53.312 --> 11:55.075
Yeah? What about me?

11:56.582 --> 11:59.210
Don't be silly.
No one would ever expect that of you.

11:59.285 --> 12:01.446
Okay. That does it.

12:07.293 --> 12:09.659
If we're gonna be late,
we're gonna have fun doing it.

12:09.729 --> 12:10.991
Give me that shower massager.

12:22.641 --> 12:26.270
Mom, I wanna stay with Peyton.
I don't wanna leave school right now.

12:27.213 --> 12:29.909
That is ridiculous.
You and Dad are never even home.

12:29.982 --> 12:31.916
No. Mom.

12:32.985 --> 12:35.385
You look about as happy as I do.

12:35.955 --> 12:37.149
You okay?

12:38.090 --> 12:40.718
I'll be fine.
I just have some things going on.

12:40.793 --> 12:42.693
Nothing I can't handle.

12:43.863 --> 12:45.922
Because it's totally unfair.

12:46.432 --> 12:47.558
Yes, it is.

12:47.633 --> 12:50.033
-Have you told her how you feel?
-No.

12:50.836 --> 12:52.599
Anyway, she's moving.

12:54.073 --> 12:56.337
At least she'd know. That's something.

12:56.742 --> 12:59.734
You're encouraging me
to hit on your brother's girlfriend?

12:59.812 --> 13:01.905
Yeah, I like you better.

13:04.850 --> 13:06.909
I barely even knew her last year.

13:07.319 --> 13:10.220
And now I can't imagine
life around here without her.

13:10.289 --> 13:11.813
No, I hate you.

13:12.491 --> 13:14.015
She's so sweet.

13:14.527 --> 13:16.290
-They said no.
-Why?

13:16.362 --> 13:19.195
Because this week
they've decided to be parents.

13:19.331 --> 13:22.061
They said that since
you have no adult supervision...

13:22.134 --> 13:24.068
it would be the same
as having me stay alone.

13:24.136 --> 13:25.194
Are you kidding?

13:25.271 --> 13:27.671
Charlie Brown has more
parental supervision than you.

13:27.740 --> 13:30.800
-Yeah, they also think--
-What?

13:32.845 --> 13:35.245
They think you're a bad influence on me.

13:36.448 --> 13:38.609
Unbelievable.
Have your parents even met you?

13:38.684 --> 13:40.151
Only briefly.

13:41.120 --> 13:43.145
I can't believe
they won't let me stay with you.

13:43.222 --> 13:46.123
My mom is being such a major...

13:47.293 --> 13:48.419
bitch.

13:48.828 --> 13:51.854
If it isn't the other woman
and my favorite travel agent.

13:51.931 --> 13:53.694
Any other places
you'd like to recommend?

13:53.766 --> 13:55.427
Yeah. Far away from me.

13:55.501 --> 13:58.561
Unless you'd like your next period
to come out of your nose.

14:00.573 --> 14:03.565
So, I showed up at Jake's this morning
with Tree Hill's finest...

14:03.642 --> 14:05.974
and guess what, no Jake, no baby.

14:06.345 --> 14:08.973
-Where the hell are they?
-Phoenix.

14:09.148 --> 14:13.175
Are you even sure Jenny is your daughter?
Because she doesn't look like a bitch.

14:13.252 --> 14:16.653
We'll see who the bitch is
once Jake spends some time in jail.

14:16.889 --> 14:18.186
It'll still be you.

14:18.891 --> 14:21.359
-Look, I'm tired of these games.
-Then leave.

14:21.427 --> 14:25.693
You don't even care about Jenny, okay?
You're just doing this to get back at Jake.

14:26.632 --> 14:30.534
You know, only someone
without a mother could think that.

14:31.103 --> 14:32.468
You know, you'd better leave...

14:32.538 --> 14:35.701
before Jenny knows
what it feels like to be motherless.

14:35.774 --> 14:38.072
Wait, she already does.

14:42.081 --> 14:45.881
Tell Jake that the longer he hides,
the worse it's gonna be for him.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.155
Don't let her get to you, Peyton.

14:51.223 --> 14:53.919
No judge is gonna side
with that psychopath over Jake.

14:53.993 --> 14:55.688
Looks like they already did.

14:55.961 --> 14:58.623
I don't even think Jake's
going to court to challenge it.

14:58.697 --> 15:00.665
You think he's gonna run again?

15:01.634 --> 15:02.862
He might.

15:02.935 --> 15:05.369
If he thinks that Jenny
will wind up with Nicki.

15:06.205 --> 15:08.673
-Damn it, I hate Mondays.
-Come on.

15:10.542 --> 15:12.009
You wanted to see me?

15:18.884 --> 15:21.182
Mr. Tagarro, close the door, please.

15:21.253 --> 15:23.744
It's the one without ''dyke'' painted on it.

15:43.676 --> 15:44.904
<i>Haley, what's wrong?</i>

15:49.415 --> 15:50.677
My parents.

15:50.749 --> 15:53.616
-What happened? Are they all right?
-Yeah, they're fine.

15:54.019 --> 15:55.919
I'm just being stupid.

15:56.922 --> 15:58.014
When they were here...

15:58.090 --> 16:00.354
I spent all my time
at Lucas' house or with you...

16:00.426 --> 16:03.793
and now that they're gone,
I just wish I could see them again.

16:03.862 --> 16:06.888
Haley, they're in Georgia.
I'd hardly say they're gone.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.900
Well, they're not here.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.561
My house isn't even my house anymore.

16:11.637 --> 16:14.401
It's like my whole family
just packed up and left...

16:14.473 --> 16:16.168
before my high school graduation.

16:16.241 --> 16:18.266
Not your whole family, Hales.

16:18.344 --> 16:20.744
You still have me. I'm not going anywhere.

16:21.246 --> 16:24.875
And your house is here, too.
It's just smaller and a lot more...

16:25.317 --> 16:26.682
apartmenty.

16:28.020 --> 16:30.682
Yeah, I know. I just....

16:31.290 --> 16:34.123
I don't mean to be such a baby about this.

16:34.226 --> 16:36.194
I just really miss them.

16:43.635 --> 16:46.433
Pack your bag. We're going to Atlanta.

16:47.172 --> 16:49.163
-Yeah, right.
-I'm serious.

16:49.742 --> 16:52.267
We can't do that.
We're broke and we have to go to school.

16:52.344 --> 16:54.574
I'm sure I could scrounge up
enough money for gas.

16:54.646 --> 16:55.704
And screw school.

16:55.781 --> 16:58.579
You're a year ahead of everybody
and there's no way I'll flunk.

16:58.650 --> 17:00.208
I married my tutor.

17:00.552 --> 17:03.282
That's really sweet. It's not that big a deal.

17:04.022 --> 17:05.923
Yes, it is, all right?

17:06.959 --> 17:08.118
Now, listen.

17:08.193 --> 17:12.289
I may not always be able to give you
everything you want, but I can do this.

17:12.798 --> 17:15.130
Come on. Let's go see our family.

17:16.702 --> 17:17.999
Thank you.

17:18.203 --> 17:21.172
You know, as long as I have you,
I have everything I want.

17:21.240 --> 17:22.570
But we're still going.

17:37.256 --> 17:39.315
You brought it on yourself, Felix.

17:39.591 --> 17:42.219
I can't believe you.
Do you know how bad this is?

17:42.294 --> 17:44.558
Mom and Dad will have
to buy the school a new wing...

17:44.630 --> 17:45.790
to get me out of this.

17:45.864 --> 17:48.992
You are missing the whole point.
Everything is always about you.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.831
You never stop to think
about other people.

17:50.903 --> 17:51.892
And you do?

17:51.970 --> 17:54.461
Did you consider what would happen
to me when you turned me in?

17:54.540 --> 17:55.564
You totally screwed me over...

17:55.641 --> 17:57.199
when I was the only one
looking out for you.

17:57.276 --> 17:58.675
You were looking out for yourself.

17:58.744 --> 18:01.577
You couldn't handle anyone thinking
your sister was a lesbian.

18:01.647 --> 18:03.945
Whatever. The whole thing
would have blown over...

18:04.016 --> 18:06.177
if you would've just
kept your big mouth shut.

18:06.985 --> 18:09.510
No one's gonna even care
when they find out I did it.

18:11.623 --> 18:13.022
Even Brooke?

18:35.481 --> 18:36.846
Can I help you with something?

18:36.915 --> 18:38.507
Hi, I'm Charlotte.

18:38.584 --> 18:40.814
My parents are looking at the house.

18:40.886 --> 18:43.150
It's cute, I guess, for the sticks.

18:43.622 --> 18:44.987
The sticks?

18:45.924 --> 18:49.360
You live here. Right. Must be a huge drag.

18:49.428 --> 18:53.296
Like, what do you do for fun
without cute boys or good parties?

18:53.565 --> 18:55.499
Well, well.

18:55.734 --> 18:59.363
We have a nightly banjo duel,
and then there's the cousin swap...

18:59.438 --> 19:02.168
and on Friday nights
we all take baths together.

19:02.641 --> 19:05.474
Look, I'm really sorry.
I didn't mean to insult you.

19:05.544 --> 19:07.739
I guess I'm just bitter about this move.

19:08.113 --> 19:09.774
Yeah, I know the feeling.

19:14.987 --> 19:17.353
Maybe Tree Hill's not so bad after all.

19:20.192 --> 19:21.716
Well, see you.

19:24.029 --> 19:25.155
Who was that?

19:26.765 --> 19:28.130
The new me.

19:36.241 --> 19:38.607
-Any word from Keith?
-No.

19:42.381 --> 19:44.508
You think he's gonna be okay?

19:45.984 --> 19:47.576
Not for a while.

19:49.855 --> 19:51.288
Keith was right.

19:52.191 --> 19:53.852
I should have told him.

19:54.493 --> 19:56.654
You thought you were
looking out for him, Lucas.

19:56.728 --> 19:58.628
Your heart was in the right place.

19:59.264 --> 20:02.665
It might take some time,
but eventually he'll understand that.

20:04.570 --> 20:06.697
So, when are you moving home?

20:10.809 --> 20:12.037
I'm not.

20:12.711 --> 20:14.178
Like hell you're not.

20:14.780 --> 20:17.442
What reason on earth
could you have for staying?

20:17.516 --> 20:20.212
If Dan could do this to his own brother...

20:20.719 --> 20:22.744
who knows what else he could be up to.

20:24.122 --> 20:27.523
I'm his one weakness. I gotta stay.

20:37.736 --> 20:40.170
<i>Hi, you've reached the Scotts.</i>
<i>My wife and I are--</i>

20:40.239 --> 20:42.230
<i>Your wife?</i>
<i>What, do you, like, own me now?</i>

20:42.341 --> 20:44.502
<i>Yeah, I do. So stop cutting me off.</i>

20:44.910 --> 20:48.846
Hi. This is Nathan and Haley Scott.
Please leave a message, or not.

20:49.081 --> 20:50.810
That's the worst thing I've ever heard.

20:50.882 --> 20:53.817
-Shut up. It rhymed. I like it.
<i>-Message has been erased.</i>

20:53.885 --> 20:55.512
Fine, let's just do one together, okay?

20:55.587 --> 20:58.556
Wait a minute. Isn't that something
only really cheesy couples do?

20:58.624 --> 21:01.388
Yeah, well, we are
a really cheesy couple, mister.

21:01.493 --> 21:02.790
-Good point.
-Okay.

21:02.861 --> 21:05.455
-Hi, you've reached Haley.
-And Nathan. I live here, too.

21:05.530 --> 21:08.192
Yes, Nathan lives here, too,
because we're married.

21:08.267 --> 21:11.395
And we can't get to the phone right now
because we're....

21:11.470 --> 21:12.835
Having sex.

21:13.505 --> 21:16.736
-I mean, we're having really hot sex.
-Okay.

21:18.810 --> 21:20.539
We're still on. Leave a message.

21:20.612 --> 21:23.172
And we'll get back
to you when we're done.

21:38.130 --> 21:40.792
This is crazy. I don't want
to get anybody else in trouble.

21:40.866 --> 21:42.026
I should just go.

21:42.334 --> 21:45.360
Jake, you need to be smart about this.
And running isn't smart.

21:45.437 --> 21:47.234
You need legal help. Settle it that way.

21:47.306 --> 21:49.433
Especially if Nicki's already done that.

21:50.575 --> 21:52.065
I can't afford a lawyer.

21:52.144 --> 21:54.169
I can. I got a great attorney.

21:54.546 --> 21:56.207
I can't ask you to do that.

21:56.682 --> 21:58.650
You're not. I'm offering.

22:02.521 --> 22:03.647
Thanks.

22:03.722 --> 22:05.781
I mean, I appreciate it...

22:05.857 --> 22:08.985
but cost aside,
there's no guarantee that I'll win.

22:09.061 --> 22:11.757
It's true. But at least this way
you get a chance.

22:11.830 --> 22:14.230
-Let me make a call.
-Okay.

22:14.800 --> 22:16.927
So that's great news.

22:21.139 --> 22:24.267
But if there's even a chance
that Nicki could get custody of Jenny...

22:24.343 --> 22:25.503
I can't take it.

22:32.117 --> 22:34.085
Keith, I'm so sorry.

22:35.587 --> 22:37.054
Yeah, me, too.

22:37.356 --> 22:38.823
Wait. Please.

22:39.358 --> 22:41.986
Karen, haven't you already done enough?

22:42.127 --> 22:43.594
I wanna help.

22:44.730 --> 22:47.665
I didn't know about Jules
until right before the wedding.

22:47.733 --> 22:52.102
And the only reason I know anything
is because I was worried about Lucas.

22:52.404 --> 22:56.431
So Andy and I hired a private investigator
to look into Dan.

22:57.509 --> 23:00.205
I had no idea
that he was involved with Jules.

23:00.278 --> 23:02.212
It doesn't really matter anymore.

23:02.581 --> 23:04.708
-Does it?
-Of course it does.

23:06.351 --> 23:08.342
If she truly loves you...

23:09.821 --> 23:11.584
couldn't you still love her?

23:13.658 --> 23:15.125
I don't know.

23:18.397 --> 23:21.525
I guess I'd at least like a chance to....

23:24.469 --> 23:27.233
I guess I'd at least
like to find out the truth.

23:32.477 --> 23:35.071
Her real name is Emily Chambers.

23:36.782 --> 23:40.684
Everything in that file is what
the investigator found out about her.

23:45.690 --> 23:46.850
Emily.

23:52.197 --> 23:54.461
Dan is a monster.

23:56.334 --> 23:58.131
But he gave me Lucas.

23:58.804 --> 24:01.329
And despite his worst intentions...

24:01.873 --> 24:04.603
I have the one person
I love most in the world.

24:06.778 --> 24:08.405
Maybe you can, too.

24:19.524 --> 24:21.924
You know, TV might be more entertaining.

24:22.994 --> 24:25.292
There's nothing on TV I want to see.

24:27.332 --> 24:28.697
Talk to me.

24:31.837 --> 24:34.499
My whole world's
being ripped away from me.

24:34.573 --> 24:36.200
So is Jake's.

24:37.075 --> 24:38.406
And yours.

24:40.912 --> 24:43.847
AII I can do is sit here
and watch it happen.

24:47.252 --> 24:50.653
Tell you what, let's change that.
I'll kill Nicki for you.

24:51.556 --> 24:54.787
No, really. At least that way,
Jake would stay here...

24:54.860 --> 24:57.852
I'd be sent to a prison in North Carolina
and be close to you...

24:57.929 --> 25:01.228
and Felix could come
and give me multiple conjugals.

25:03.768 --> 25:04.996
That was a joke.

25:07.339 --> 25:10.604
Brooke, you know how they say,
''Misery loves company.''

25:11.610 --> 25:14.272
There's something
I got to tell you about Felix.

25:21.253 --> 25:22.413
We are finished.

25:22.487 --> 25:24.079
-Let me explain.
-No.

25:24.155 --> 25:26.851
I cannot believe you would be
such a hateful scumbag...

25:26.925 --> 25:30.759
as to write ''dyke'' anywhere,
let alone on my best friend's locker.

25:30.829 --> 25:32.296
Brooke, wait.

25:32.464 --> 25:33.954
I am so glad I am moving.

25:34.032 --> 25:37.001
I had no idea I was
a Grand Wizard's next-door neighbor.

25:37.068 --> 25:40.060
And you actually had me starting to think
you were a decent guy.

25:40.138 --> 25:42.504
I was trying to protect my sister, Brooke.

25:42.574 --> 25:44.405
Like I did at the night at the dance...

25:44.476 --> 25:46.444
when Peyton and I argued
and you dumped me.

25:46.511 --> 25:49.173
-I wasn't thinking.
-Well, what a surprise.

25:49.447 --> 25:52.177
I was in a dark place
and I took it out on Peyton. I'm sorry.

25:52.250 --> 25:54.013
Yeah, you're right. You are sorry.

25:54.085 --> 25:57.577
So why don't you crawl back
into your dark, little place and die there?

26:16.074 --> 26:17.939
Coming in to say goodbye?

26:18.710 --> 26:20.974
Actually, I think I'm gonna stay.

26:21.880 --> 26:23.211
At least for now.

26:25.050 --> 26:27.245
Look, as messed up as it was...

26:27.319 --> 26:29.514
you did keep your promise
to leave Keith alone.

26:29.588 --> 26:31.419
So I need to keep mine.

26:32.190 --> 26:36.126
And you're also paying
for my HCM medicine...

26:36.194 --> 26:39.493
and since I really don't want
to die anytime soon...

26:39.898 --> 26:41.229
I need it.

26:42.734 --> 26:44.201
What about your mom?

26:45.503 --> 26:49.599
She's not too happy
with me right now, I think.

26:50.775 --> 26:54.302
Besides you, I'm currently
her least favorite person.

26:55.480 --> 26:57.345
I'm sure that's not true.

26:58.016 --> 26:59.950
But I'm thrilled to have you.

27:03.388 --> 27:04.582
Thanks.

27:33.351 --> 27:35.342
<i>Nathan, I'm slipping.</i>
<i>You're gonna drop me.</i>

27:35.420 --> 27:38.912
<i>Drop you? lf I wanted to,</i>
<i>I could shoot you like a three-pointer.</i>

27:38.990 --> 27:41.220
<i>-Want me to try?</i>
<i>-Don't you dare.</i>

27:41.292 --> 27:43.624
<i>Well, we're gonna do this the right way.</i>

27:43.928 --> 27:46.897
Now, since I couldn't get
the fancy honeymoon suite...

27:46.965 --> 27:48.455
I figured I could, you know...

27:48.533 --> 27:51.434
at least carry you across
our one-bedroom threshold.

27:54.172 --> 27:55.537
Oh, my God!

27:56.274 --> 27:57.764
I wanted everything to be perfect.

27:57.842 --> 28:00.470
I know you didn't get your dream wedding
or dream honeymoon.

28:00.545 --> 28:03.605
-I got my dream guy.
-Yeah, you did get that.

28:13.425 --> 28:15.222
Honeymoon suite, huh?

28:16.961 --> 28:19.054
Listen, we don't have to do anything,
all right?

28:19.130 --> 28:20.722
That's not why I married you.

28:21.900 --> 28:23.367
You gotta be kidding me.

28:30.909 --> 28:33.036
What have I got myself into?

28:48.860 --> 28:50.521
I'm here for Haley Scott.

28:51.730 --> 28:53.061
Haley who?

28:54.999 --> 28:56.398
Haley James.

28:57.168 --> 28:58.499
Are you on the list?

29:01.106 --> 29:02.664
I'm her husband.

29:48.119 --> 29:50.519
That's great. You have to tell her I said hi.

29:54.893 --> 29:57.794
Nathan. Oh, my God.
What are you doing here?

30:07.238 --> 30:09.001
I wanted to see you.

30:10.441 --> 30:12.102
I needed to see you.

30:13.678 --> 30:16.010
I'm so glad you did. I miss you.

30:18.983 --> 30:23.249
Listen, I asked you to marry me
because I want to spend my life with you.

30:23.321 --> 30:24.982
I still want that.

30:27.692 --> 30:30.126
-I love you, Haley.
-I love you, too.

30:30.195 --> 30:32.720
So I came here for you,
and I'll be here no matter what.

30:32.797 --> 30:34.788
I'll go with you on the tour.
I'll wait for you.

30:34.866 --> 30:36.766
Whatever you want me to do.

30:36.835 --> 30:38.735
I'm not giving up on us.

30:40.038 --> 30:42.029
I'm not giving up on our marriage.

30:46.778 --> 30:48.769
I don't know what to say.

30:53.117 --> 30:57.178
No, Chris and I aren't together.
I promise you, it's never been about that.

31:02.794 --> 31:04.091
You're not wearing your ring.

31:06.364 --> 31:07.729
I love you.

31:08.600 --> 31:09.692
I do.

31:11.903 --> 31:15.100
But I feel like
maybe we rushed things a little bit.

31:15.173 --> 31:17.539
Maybe I rushed things a little bit.

31:17.609 --> 31:20.703
We're so young,
and I wasn't ready for all this.

31:20.879 --> 31:22.972
You and the music...

31:24.415 --> 31:26.713
and now it's all happening at once...

31:27.919 --> 31:29.716
and it's really hard.

31:31.689 --> 31:34.749
I don't know if I can be
who you need me to be.

31:34.959 --> 31:36.950
AII I want you to be is my wife.

31:38.296 --> 31:40.264
Is that too much to ask?

31:44.235 --> 31:45.634
We're ready.

31:49.007 --> 31:50.474
I have to go.

31:54.579 --> 31:57.742
God. Can you just wait here
and I will meet you after the show...

31:57.815 --> 32:01.410
and then we can talk. I don't even....

32:05.390 --> 32:07.620
I'm really happy that you came.

32:11.696 --> 32:13.061
I love you.

32:18.836 --> 32:22.067
<i>Please welcome back.:</i>
<i>Haley James!</i>

32:58.343 --> 33:01.073
Mom and Dad are sending me
to military school.

33:01.512 --> 33:04.379
At least there won't be any lesbians
to scare you.

33:04.582 --> 33:06.447
Brooke dumped me, too.

33:09.420 --> 33:12.856
You know, no matter
where we moved or how we fit in...

33:12.924 --> 33:15.916
you always had my back,
and I always had yours. AIways.

33:17.495 --> 33:18.792
Now you turn your back on me...

33:18.863 --> 33:21.195
because I wrote ''dyke''
on some stupid chick's locker?

33:21.265 --> 33:22.732
She's not stupid.

33:23.267 --> 33:26.498
Peyton has been more of a friend to me
than you have.

33:26.571 --> 33:29.369
And she didn't do anything
to deserve you tagging her locker.

33:29.440 --> 33:31.635
-Who cares?
-I care.

33:32.443 --> 33:34.104
It's a hate crime.

33:34.946 --> 33:38.347
-It's just a word.
-It's not just a word.

33:38.549 --> 33:40.073
It's who I am.

33:45.857 --> 33:47.848
Peyton isn't gay, Felix.

33:48.826 --> 33:49.918
I am.

33:50.595 --> 33:53.189
So you want to spray-paint
''dyke'' somewhere?

33:53.331 --> 33:55.959
Do it on my walls. Spray it on me.

33:57.402 --> 33:58.926
What are you talking about?

33:59.003 --> 34:01.301
You know what I'm talking about.

34:02.073 --> 34:03.472
The rumors.

34:04.008 --> 34:05.771
They weren't rumors.

34:07.111 --> 34:08.510
They aren't.

34:09.480 --> 34:10.879
Shut up, Anna.

34:10.947 --> 34:13.280
No, I won't shut up.

34:13.684 --> 34:15.708
You think I've been running from this?

34:15.786 --> 34:18.949
I haven't. I have been carrying it around.

34:19.724 --> 34:22.386
And if you think what you've been doing
is protecting me...

34:22.460 --> 34:23.859
then you're wrong.

34:23.928 --> 34:27.329
You have been making me
afraid to be who I am.

34:28.699 --> 34:30.996
Well, I won't be afraid anymore.

34:33.237 --> 34:35.137
Now you know the truth.

34:35.606 --> 34:36.833
I'm gay.

34:45.315 --> 34:47.511
So do you still have my back?

35:06.537 --> 35:08.528
I'm sorry about you and Felix.

35:14.378 --> 35:15.640
You okay?

35:18.049 --> 35:22.452
It's just every time I see something
in Tree Hill, it's probably the last time.

35:22.520 --> 35:26.115
So I feel like I have to take
mental pictures of everything, you know?

35:28.559 --> 35:32.495
Make sure you make me look good
when you take my picture.

35:34.799 --> 35:37.199
So what are you gonna miss
most about me?

35:38.035 --> 35:39.263
I can only choose one thing?

35:39.337 --> 35:41.703
Yes, and it has to be something good.

35:41.772 --> 35:45.572
Not how much you'll miss
hanging out with me or how hot I am.

35:47.078 --> 35:49.308
-Neither one of those, huh?
-No.

35:49.380 --> 35:50.608
Damn it.

35:51.983 --> 35:54.281
I'd miss the girl behind the red door.

36:01.893 --> 36:03.121
Come on.

36:18.442 --> 36:21.172
This is all my stuff. I don't understand.

36:21.445 --> 36:23.845
I had my mom talk to your parents...

36:23.915 --> 36:27.112
and they said you could stay here
till the summer.

36:28.119 --> 36:32.886
They didn't want to, Brooke,
but my mom can be really convincing.

36:34.492 --> 36:36.255
You did this for me?

36:37.295 --> 36:39.525
I wasn't ready to lose you yet.

36:43.467 --> 36:45.697
So, you gonna stay or what?

36:48.105 --> 36:49.732
Yeah, of course.

36:53.711 --> 36:55.770
I wasn't ready to be lost.

36:56.614 --> 36:57.945
Thank you.

37:15.666 --> 37:18.658
So much for painting
happy, little trees, huh?

37:19.403 --> 37:21.667
I think you might want
to start locking your door...

37:21.739 --> 37:24.230
if a man with a baby
can take you by surprise.

37:25.309 --> 37:27.436
If every surprise
is this man with this baby...

37:27.511 --> 37:29.638
then the door stays unlocked.

37:30.748 --> 37:32.716
I was worried you skipped town again.

37:32.783 --> 37:34.512
No, I want to stay.

37:35.219 --> 37:38.985
Look, I said when I came back in town,
I wasn't gonna run anymore. I meant it.

37:39.056 --> 37:42.355
If Nicki's ready to fight for custody,
then so am I.

37:44.195 --> 37:46.425
What if she shows up tonight?

37:46.564 --> 37:48.259
I locked the door, just in case.

37:50.067 --> 37:53.161
Look, Peyton, I know this is hard.

37:53.237 --> 37:55.865
I'm sorry you have to deal with this.
It's just...

37:55.940 --> 37:58.033
the last time I left town,
it was me and Jenny.

37:58.109 --> 38:02.910
And now it's me, Jenny and you.

38:14.492 --> 38:16.824
<i>You guys have been great.</i>
<i>Chris Keller's up next.</i>

38:40.918 --> 38:43.386
-Dinner's in ten minutes.
-Okay.

38:45.022 --> 38:48.014
Thank you, Karen.
You know you saved my life, right?

38:48.526 --> 38:50.619
Don't thank me yet, Brooke.

38:51.128 --> 38:52.390
Sit down.

38:55.533 --> 38:59.993
Now, I know your parents
are a lot more hands-off.

39:02.273 --> 39:04.036
But I'm not gonna make it easy on you...

39:04.108 --> 39:06.770
and sometimes
you're not gonna like me for it.

39:06.844 --> 39:09.813
When you're in my house,
you live by my rules.

39:10.014 --> 39:12.209
There will be no staying out all night...

39:12.283 --> 39:15.309
no boys sleeping over, no....

39:18.823 --> 39:20.882
It's just like having a real mom.

39:27.064 --> 39:29.328
-AII right.
-Okay.

39:42.480 --> 39:44.380
Keith, are you leaving?

39:46.717 --> 39:47.877
Look...

39:49.487 --> 39:53.253
I know I made the wrong decision
in not telling you about Jules and Dan.

39:53.791 --> 39:55.281
And I'm sorry.

39:56.260 --> 39:58.660
But you got to know Jules loves you.

40:02.166 --> 40:03.690
You mean Emily?

40:06.504 --> 40:08.836
You should've told me the truth, Luke.

40:09.039 --> 40:11.064
I've always been honest with you.

40:14.145 --> 40:16.113
I thought we meant more to each other.

40:18.916 --> 40:20.781
But maybe I was wrong.

40:24.388 --> 40:25.912
Keith, where are you going?

40:27.224 --> 40:28.589
Don't know.

40:29.527 --> 40:30.824
You coming back?

40:33.063 --> 40:35.190
For the first time in my life...

40:35.966 --> 40:39.129
I don't know if I have anything
to come back for.

41:51.408 --> 41:53.035
Good show, Haley.

43:32.209 --> 43:33.198
