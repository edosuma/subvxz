(Male announcer)
Previously on <i>Hell's Kitchen...</i>

00:04.271 --> 00:06.241
Chef Ramsay surprised
the final five.

00:06.341 --> 00:08.225
There's your kitchens!

00:08.325 --> 00:09.425
[Horn playing <i>la cucaracha]</i>

00:09.446 --> 00:11.825
Are you kidding me?
Catering trucks?

00:12.025 --> 00:13.260
(Announcer)
With a signature lunch
challenge...

00:13.360 --> 00:14.776
Your favorite dish
belongs to...

00:14.876 --> 00:16.207
(Announcer)
Gail's steak salad...

00:16.408 --> 00:17.930
Well done!
Really good.

00:18.030 --> 00:19.090
(Announcer)
Was a clear favorite.

00:19.190 --> 00:20.390
Thanks, guys.

00:20.390 --> 00:21.901
(Announcer)
While Russell's
grilled octopus...

00:22.201 --> 00:23.401
You did
not like this dish.

00:23.431 --> 00:24.899
(Announcer)
Was a clear disaster.

00:24.994 --> 00:26.528
Russell's
Mr. fancy pants.

00:26.596 --> 00:27.730
It was nice to see him
come in dead last,

00:27.797 --> 00:29.331
that's for sure.

00:29.399 --> 00:30.833
(Announcer)
But at dinner service...

00:30.900 --> 00:32.034
Jillian,
they're overcooked.

00:32.101 --> 00:33.602
<i>Start the tea again.</i>

00:33.670 --> 00:35.070
(Announcer)
Russell redeemed himself...

00:35.138 --> 00:35.838
<i>They have</i>
<i>no color on that side.</i>

00:35.905 --> 00:38.407
The pan's not hot enough.

00:38.475 --> 00:39.875
On the fish station.

00:39.943 --> 00:41.210
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Scallops cooked perfectly.</i>

00:41.277 --> 00:42.177
(Announcer)
Nona, on the other hand,

00:42.245 --> 00:43.479
had a sub-par performance.

00:43.546 --> 00:45.447
Crunchy spaghetti.
Come on!

00:45.515 --> 00:47.950
(Announcer)
While challenge winner Gail
failed again.

00:48.017 --> 00:49.351
Where's the garnish?

00:49.419 --> 00:50.652
Oops. Not ready yet.

00:50.720 --> 00:52.054
(Announcer)
And again...

00:52.122 --> 00:53.555
Gail is just completely
non-communication.

00:53.623 --> 00:55.023
(Announcer)
And again...

00:55.091 --> 00:56.125
Hard, undercooked,
and stone cold.

00:56.192 --> 00:57.659
This is not normal.

00:57.727 --> 00:59.962
It's like a joke, like
you've just been punked.

01:00.029 --> 01:01.397
(Announcer)
But it was Trev's mangling
of the meat...

01:01.464 --> 01:03.165
Put your finger on that.
They're overcooked.

01:03.233 --> 01:05.634
(Announcer)
That pushed Chef Ramsay
over the edge.

01:05.702 --> 01:07.269
It's like you're
doing it on purpose!

01:07.337 --> 01:08.670
I'm done.
Good luck.

01:08.738 --> 01:09.838
Superstars.

01:09.906 --> 01:11.673
(Announcer)
And right out the door.

01:11.741 --> 01:13.041
We are [Bleep].

01:13.109 --> 01:14.610
(Announcer)
At elimination time,

01:14.677 --> 01:16.912
the Chefs had lots
of choices, but chose...

01:16.980 --> 01:19.348
Gail and Trev.

01:19.416 --> 01:21.383
(Announcer)
But Chef Ramsay had a message
for Jillian.

01:21.451 --> 01:23.118
Listen
to me carefully...

01:23.186 --> 01:24.486
You gotta pull it back.
I didn't like what I saw.

01:24.554 --> 01:26.188
I know
I disappointed you.

01:26.256 --> 01:28.023
I disappointed myself.

01:28.091 --> 01:29.925
(Announcer)
In the end,
early favorite Gail...

01:29.993 --> 01:31.660
I thought that you were
going to go a lot further.

01:31.728 --> 01:33.595

<i>I feel like I'm</i>
<i>white as a ghost right now.</i>

02:56.846 --> 02:59.047
How does it feel
to be in the final four?

02:59.115 --> 03:01.116
Wow.

03:01.184 --> 03:03.552
I made it
to the final four.

03:03.620 --> 03:05.721
And it's
so close to the end.

03:05.788 --> 03:07.289
And it's just like,
oh, man.

03:07.357 --> 03:08.757
Time for a cigarette.

03:08.825 --> 03:10.459
Ooh, I wanna go
out there with you.

03:10.527 --> 03:12.528
Hell yeah, I wanna make it
into the final three.

03:12.595 --> 03:14.897
So I just have to come back
tomorrow, and keep fighting,

03:14.964 --> 03:16.732
and just hope that
I do better tomorrow

03:16.799 --> 03:18.500
than I did today.

03:18.568 --> 03:19.968
I have to have a [Bleep]
stellar performance tomorrow,

03:20.036 --> 03:21.603
or I'm gonna get put up.

03:21.671 --> 03:24.740
Did you think coming in here,
the first dinner service,

03:24.807 --> 03:26.408
that it would be us four?

03:26.476 --> 03:28.877
I never thought Trev
would make it this far.

03:32.582 --> 03:34.149
At this point right now,

03:34.217 --> 03:35.784
I think my biggest
competition's myself.

03:35.852 --> 03:37.986
Basically Trevor
is way over his head,

03:38.054 --> 03:39.821
and I don't think
Nona's there either.

03:39.889 --> 03:41.423
But I think Nona's
better than Jillian.

03:41.491 --> 03:42.991
Jillian had a lot
of bad services lately.

03:43.059 --> 03:45.394
So it's like
she's falling apart.

03:45.461 --> 03:46.395
<i>(Jillian)</i>
<i>Good night, monkey.</i>

03:57.574 --> 04:02.244
(Announcer)
Nona, Russell, Trev, and Jillian

04:02.312 --> 04:04.146
designed by Chef Ramsay.

04:04.213 --> 04:06.715
But they are about to face
their most difficult one yet.

04:06.783 --> 04:07.783
Morning.

04:07.850 --> 04:09.351
(All)
Morning, Chef.

04:09.419 --> 04:10.719
Okay, now that we're
down to our final four,

04:10.787 --> 04:12.087
I'm gonna
pair you up, yes?

04:12.155 --> 04:13.855
(All)
Yes, Chef.

04:13.923 --> 04:16.524
Trev and Jillian, one team.
Russell and Nona, one team.

04:16.593 --> 04:17.793
Yes, Chef.

04:17.860 --> 04:19.293
<i>And I would just</i>
<i>like you</i>

04:19.362 --> 04:20.796
to come up with
one great dish together.

04:20.863 --> 04:22.264
(All)
Yes, Chef.

04:22.332 --> 04:23.932
(Announcer)
What the Chefs don't know

04:24.000 --> 04:25.734
is that this cooking assignment
is a mere distraction.

04:25.802 --> 04:29.805
30 minutes,
starting from now.

04:29.872 --> 04:31.039
Oh, yeah.

04:31.107 --> 04:32.374
(Announcer)
And while they're busy

04:32.442 --> 04:33.609
preparing their dishes...

04:33.676 --> 04:35.377
(Russell)
What do you wanna do?

04:35.445 --> 04:36.745
(Announcer)
In the red kitchen,
Chef Ramsay is busy

04:36.813 --> 04:37.713
preparing
their next challenge:

04:37.780 --> 04:39.181
Taste it, now make it.

04:42.151 --> 04:45.020
Each of the Chefs will have
to recreate Chef Ramsay's dish

04:45.088 --> 04:48.023
by completely
relying on their palate.

04:49.959 --> 04:51.860
Chef Ramsay believes
that a great Chef

04:51.928 --> 04:53.962
should be able to identify
the key ingredients

04:54.030 --> 04:55.797
of any dish
simply by tasting it.

04:55.865 --> 04:57.032
Okay, good.

04:57.100 --> 04:58.700
Bring them
down over here.

04:58.768 --> 05:00.902
(Announcer)
And he's going to use the dishes

05:00.970 --> 05:02.704
created by the final four
to demonstrate.

05:02.772 --> 05:06.241
Okay,
Trev and Jillian first.

05:06.242 --> 05:08.443
Uh, we did a little bit
of--don'

05:08.511 --> 05:09.678
yeah, I'm gonna
let the taste

05:09.746 --> 05:10.879
do the talking.

05:10.947 --> 05:13.382
Clearly, lamb cutlets.

05:13.449 --> 05:15.450
In here, we have...

05:15.518 --> 05:17.452
Pear, red pepper...

05:17.520 --> 05:19.221
Yes, Chef.

05:19.288 --> 05:22.791
Lambazine seasoned with cinnamon?

05:22.859 --> 05:24.860
Yep.
Wow, he's good.

05:24.927 --> 05:26.628
Dude, this guy's palate
is ridiculous.

05:26.696 --> 05:28.230
Russell and Nona.

05:28.297 --> 05:30.399
I wouldn't even have
been able to do that.

05:30.466 --> 05:34.169
And I made the [Bleep].

05:34.237 --> 05:36.571
That's a rib eye.

05:36.639 --> 05:38.640
Uh, there's
a little kick

05:38.708 --> 05:41.376
right...
At the beginning.

05:41.444 --> 05:42.644
<i>[Snaps]</i>
<i>That is not lime.</i>

05:42.712 --> 05:44.579
It's lemon.
Yep.

05:44.647 --> 05:45.714
<i>Yeah, and</i>
<i>it's not creme fraiche.</i>

05:45.782 --> 05:46.715
Mascarpone?

05:46.783 --> 05:47.883
Yep.
Yes, Chef.

05:47.950 --> 05:49.785
<i>Delicious.</i>

05:49.852 --> 05:51.953
Chef is definitely in the elite
of super tasters.

05:52.021 --> 05:54.089
Another delicious dish.

05:54.157 --> 05:56.291
Thank you, Chef.

05:56.359 --> 05:57.392
<i>But get prepared now</i>

05:57.460 --> 05:59.061
for your real challenge.

05:59.128 --> 06:01.430
(Nona)
What?

06:01.497 --> 06:03.365
What do you mean,
that's not our challenge?

06:03.433 --> 06:05.867
Now, for your
next challenge....

06:05.935 --> 06:08.603
<i>I want you to taste a dish</i>
<i>that I've just cooked.</i>

06:08.671 --> 06:11.039
Once you've tasted it,
you're gonna recreate it.

06:11.107 --> 06:13.208
Ooh.

06:13.276 --> 06:14.876
<i>Now the person that comes</i>
<i>closest to recreating this dish</i>

06:14.944 --> 06:15.844
wins the challenge.

06:15.912 --> 06:17.579
<i>45 minutes.</i>

06:17.647 --> 06:20.449
<i>Starting from...Now.</i>

06:20.516 --> 06:22.317
(Announcer)
With no information

06:22.385 --> 06:24.586
about the ingredients
or recipe,

06:24.654 --> 06:26.621
and only one
sample dish to reference,

06:26.689 --> 06:28.457
each Chef must
recreate the dish

06:28.524 --> 06:30.592
from sight,
smell, and taste.

06:30.660 --> 06:32.561
I'm trying to, like, pick out
different things

06:32.628 --> 06:34.496
that I know
are definitely in here.

06:34.564 --> 06:36.398
But at the same time,
I'm also kind of like...

06:36.466 --> 06:38.600
Ah, it's so good.

06:38.668 --> 06:40.635
Close your eyes.
Taste, taste, taste.

06:40.703 --> 06:43.171
I eat pork all the time.

06:43.239 --> 06:44.940
There's not a shadow
of a doubt in my mind

06:45.007 --> 06:46.775
that I'm eating pork
right now.

06:46.843 --> 06:49.211
Right away,
I pick veal right up.

06:49.278 --> 06:51.012
I'm very confident
in my palate.

06:51.080 --> 06:52.047
I definitely think
I can recreate the dish.

06:57.553 --> 07:00.522
When I pulled veal,
Trev pulled veal.

07:00.590 --> 07:03.325
And so I'm like,
"okay, so he's watching me."

07:03.392 --> 07:06.328
And so then I go
and I grab pork...

07:06.395 --> 07:08.130
Just to [Bleep] With him.
[Laughing]

07:10.600 --> 07:12.300
Hee, hee, hee.

07:12.368 --> 07:14.002
Let's go,
let's go, let's go.

07:14.070 --> 07:14.870
Have some options
up your sleeve, yes?

07:14.937 --> 07:16.071
(All)
Yes, Chef.

07:16.139 --> 07:17.272
(Announcer)
Nona and Russell

07:17.340 --> 07:18.573
have decided on veal,

07:18.641 --> 07:20.375
while Jillian
has selected pork.

07:20.443 --> 07:22.577
Meanwhile,
Trev is undecided

07:22.645 --> 07:24.112
but is playing it smart.

07:24.180 --> 07:26.047
He said,
"give yourself options,"

07:26.115 --> 07:27.582
so I was doing two of
everything that I was unsure of.

07:30.820 --> 07:32.587
I did one pork and one veal.

07:32.655 --> 07:35.090
I did sweet potatoes
and I did the carrots.

07:35.158 --> 07:37.192
Everybody's looking for
any advantage they can get.

07:37.260 --> 07:39.060
Let's good, guys, yeah?
Make it count, yes.

07:39.128 --> 07:40.729
The only thing
I could taste in the puree

07:40.797 --> 07:42.130
was star anise.

07:42.198 --> 07:43.498
I couldn't taste
if it was carrots,

07:43.566 --> 07:44.866
butternut squash, or yams.

07:44.934 --> 07:46.301
So I have to just
go with my gut.

07:48.805 --> 07:51.640
(Announcer)
Russell decides to go
with a yam puree,

07:51.707 --> 07:53.175
as do Nona and Jillian.

07:53.242 --> 07:55.577
Trev, once again,
hedges his bets.

07:55.645 --> 07:56.812
I was stuck on the puree.

07:56.879 --> 07:58.313
I mean, I've made both,

07:58.381 --> 08:00.215
but this was
a natural sweetness.

08:00.283 --> 08:02.517
And I was certain
it was [Bleep] Carrot.

08:02.585 --> 08:04.119
So I went with it.

08:04.187 --> 08:05.787
<i>Last 15 minutes.</i>

08:05.855 --> 08:07.556
Don't even
think about plating up

08:07.623 --> 08:08.723
till at least
three minutes to go, yes?

08:08.791 --> 08:10.192
(All)
Yes, Chef.

08:10.259 --> 08:11.893
(Announcer)
The final four have all chosen

08:11.961 --> 08:13.495
celery root and cabbage
to garnish the main components

08:13.563 --> 08:15.564
of Chef Ramsay's dish.

08:15.631 --> 08:17.999
But while everyone else used
bacon to accent the cabbage,

08:18.067 --> 08:19.768
Nona tastes something else.

08:19.836 --> 08:23.405
When I taste, I'm trying
to feel the texture,

08:23.472 --> 08:25.640
and I knew it was pancetta.

08:25.708 --> 08:27.042
(Announcer)
Now that Nona's content

08:27.109 --> 08:28.810
with her pancetta,

08:28.878 --> 08:30.512
the Chefs must
decode the final element

08:30.580 --> 08:34.182
of Chef Ramsay's dish--
the sauce.

08:34.250 --> 08:37.018
Ooh, I think
I know what the sauce is.

08:37.086 --> 08:39.087
It was, like,
a brown gravy truffle sauce.

08:39.155 --> 08:40.688
A little chicken stock.

08:40.756 --> 08:42.823
And I swear, it tasted
exactly like the one

08:42.892 --> 08:44.392
that Chef Ramsay made.

08:44.460 --> 08:46.428
(Announcer)
The Chefs have all chosen

08:46.495 --> 08:48.263
the same base
for their sauce.

08:48.331 --> 08:51.633
But Trev, as usual,
isn't done yet.

08:51.701 --> 08:55.537
I'm really working
on that sauce.

08:55.605 --> 08:56.171
That sweetness
you're only gonna get

08:56.239 --> 08:57.372
by using wine.

08:57.440 --> 08:58.974
So I added that to--bam.

08:59.041 --> 09:01.176
All right,
got the sweetness.

09:01.244 --> 09:02.677
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Three minutes to go!</i>

09:02.745 --> 09:04.512
Start putting
<i>the food on the plate.</i>

09:07.383 --> 09:09.217
I'm eating the pork,
I'm eating the veal,

09:09.285 --> 09:10.418
I'm eating the pork,
I'm eating the veal.

09:10.486 --> 09:12.153
They're close
in flavor and texture.

09:12.221 --> 09:13.121
It's hard
to [Bleep] Differentiate.

09:13.189 --> 09:16.458
Ten, nine, eight...

09:16.525 --> 09:19.594
So I made a snap judgment
and I went with the pork.

09:19.662 --> 09:21.429
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

09:21.497 --> 09:23.198
And serve!

09:23.266 --> 09:24.933
Ooh, that was fun.

09:25.001 --> 09:26.534
Ah, I forgot the puree.

09:26.602 --> 09:27.435
It's sitting right there.
Ah, [Bleep].

09:27.503 --> 09:29.905
Gah, great.

09:29.972 --> 09:31.506
The [Bleep] Puree.

09:31.574 --> 09:35.043
There I go again,
rushing and not thinking,

09:35.111 --> 09:36.177
and [Bleep].

09:38.114 --> 09:39.814
Okay, Jillian.

09:39.882 --> 09:41.249
<i>Let's go with you</i>
<i>first, please.</i>

09:41.317 --> 09:42.651
Ladies first.
Yes, Chef.

09:42.718 --> 09:44.219
Thank you very much.
Okay, what is it?
Chef.

09:44.287 --> 09:47.222
A roasted pork loin
with brown truffle gravy

09:47.290 --> 09:49.357
and sweet potatoes.

09:49.425 --> 09:51.059
Pork's cooked nicely.

09:51.127 --> 09:52.460
Thank you, Chef.

09:52.528 --> 09:53.929
Thank you. Mm-hmm.
<i>Thank you, Chef.</i>

09:53.996 --> 09:56.131
He didn't say anything
bad about my plate,

09:56.198 --> 09:57.499
so at least
my [Bleep] Tastes good.

09:57.566 --> 09:59.434
Nona.

09:59.502 --> 10:01.903
Describe the dish, please.

10:01.971 --> 10:03.438
I have a pan-seared veal,

10:03.506 --> 10:06.007
<i>and I have</i>
<i>cabbage with pancetta.</i>

10:06.075 --> 10:07.776
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>
And for the puree,

10:07.843 --> 10:08.944
I have sweet potatoes

10:09.011 --> 10:10.378
<i>with star anise.</i>

10:10.446 --> 10:11.880
Nice.

10:11.948 --> 10:13.848
Chef isn't
saying anything.

10:13.916 --> 10:15.784
He's just like,
"yeah, nice. Mm, mm."

10:15.851 --> 10:17.185
Mm. Yeah.

10:17.253 --> 10:18.787
So what is it?

10:18.854 --> 10:20.155
Nice, thank you.
<i>Thank you.</i>

10:20.222 --> 10:21.856
Russell.

10:21.924 --> 10:23.558
<i>It's a pan-roasted</i>
<i>veal loin.</i>

10:23.626 --> 10:26.161
Napa cabbage with
a little bit of bacon,

10:26.228 --> 10:28.663
and sweet potato puree with
a little bit of star anise.

10:28.731 --> 10:30.999
And then, you know,
I just seasoned it.

10:31.067 --> 10:32.934
My plate looks
exactly like Chef Ramsay's.

10:33.002 --> 10:34.936
Everything looks spot on.

10:35.004 --> 10:36.871
Trev. Thank you.
And what is it?

10:36.939 --> 10:38.640
Pork loin.
Pork loin.

10:38.708 --> 10:39.874
Over a bed of
the Napa cabbage.

10:39.942 --> 10:41.676
Mm-hmm.

10:41.744 --> 10:43.912
<i>And I did a port wine</i>

10:43.980 --> 10:46.848
dark chicken sauce for it.

10:46.916 --> 10:48.383
The sauce is delicious.

10:48.451 --> 10:50.151
Thank you.
Why port wine?

10:50.219 --> 10:52.087
I tasted a little sweetness
on the one that you gave us,

10:52.154 --> 10:54.022
so I was trying
to search for that.

10:54.090 --> 10:55.156
Yeah, interesting.

10:55.224 --> 10:56.558
<i>Where is your puree?</i>

11:08.938 --> 11:10.005
You made it
and you didn't put it on.

11:10.072 --> 11:10.872
I--yeah.

[Bleep].

11:12.174 --> 11:14.075
Yeah, I know.

11:14.143 --> 11:15.844
Why'd you make
a stunning puree like that

11:15.911 --> 11:16.778
and then not
put it on the plate?

11:16.846 --> 11:18.113
Spaced out.

11:18.180 --> 11:21.049
You would've been
the only one right.

11:21.117 --> 11:22.851
For me to [Bleep]
Up something as stupid

11:22.918 --> 11:23.985
as forgetting
to plate something,

11:24.053 --> 11:25.787
it's just--
it's unacceptable.

11:25.855 --> 11:27.856
But at least nobody else
got the carrot puree.

11:27.923 --> 11:29.457
Okay, fascinating.

11:29.525 --> 11:31.026
<i>The one thing you all had,</i>

12:06.629 --> 12:07.862
Star anise and a little
bit of cream sauce.

12:07.930 --> 12:09.064
Star anise.

12:09.131 --> 12:10.765
And you put star anise
in yours?

12:10.833 --> 12:12.434
Yeah, I boiled it off
with star anise.

Okay. Congratulations
to you both.

Inside the cabbage,
there is bacon, Russell.

Nona, inside your cabbage,
there is pancetta.

16:56.581 --> 16:58.415
back in <i>Hell's Kitchen,</i>

16:58.483 --> 17:01.752
Jillian and Trev are working
on a strategy of their own.

17:01.820 --> 17:03.554
Bet that Nona
and [Bleep] Russell

17:03.621 --> 17:04.855
don't show up for
two or three days now.

17:04.923 --> 17:06.156
Let them get put up
for elimination tonight,

17:06.223 --> 17:07.925
even if they do good.
[Giggles]

17:07.992 --> 17:10.461
Boo-yah-shaka!

17:10.528 --> 17:13.664
Ah, that's my I like it.

17:13.732 --> 17:15.365
Jillian and I
have already decided

17:15.433 --> 17:16.599
we don't want
these two here anymore.

17:16.667 --> 17:18.702
And we'd like to see us,
the underdogs,

17:18.770 --> 17:20.537
take it away
from the privileged.

17:27.545 --> 17:28.912
<i>(Jillian)</i>
<i>Here they come.</i>

17:28.980 --> 17:30.447
<i>What up?</i>
<i>Hi, guys.</i>

17:30.515 --> 17:34.852
Hey, it's
the pretty girls.

17:34.919 --> 17:37.888
[Chuckles]

17:37.956 --> 17:40.991
I really, really
wanted to take Jillian,

17:41.059 --> 17:43.994
'cause I know that she's been
pretty down and out lately.

17:44.062 --> 17:48.165
But picking Russell was more
strategy than really anything.

17:48.233 --> 17:49.967
'Cause if he goes with me,

17:50.034 --> 17:53.370
then that means
I'm not on his target list.

17:53.438 --> 17:54.471
Did you all
have fun today?

17:54.539 --> 17:55.439
Yeah, [Bleep] Loads.

17:55.507 --> 17:57.708
[Scoffs]

17:57.776 --> 17:59.076
<i>Yeah, well,</i>
<i>be unhappy with yourself.</i>

17:59.144 --> 18:00.844
Don't be a bitch to us.

18:00.912 --> 18:02.679
Jillian,
she's got a bad attitude.

18:02.747 --> 18:04.314
I feel like she's
wasting all of our time.

18:04.382 --> 18:05.682
She needs to go home.

18:05.750 --> 18:07.084
Right, let's go,
guys, yes?

18:07.152 --> 18:08.318
Get on your stations.
Yes, Chef.

18:08.386 --> 18:11.021
Except you, Jillian.

18:11.089 --> 18:12.890
I want two minutes
with you, let's go.

18:15.126 --> 18:16.226
Oh, [Bleep].

18:16.294 --> 18:17.261
It's not looking good

18:17.328 --> 18:18.495
for Jillian right now.

18:18.563 --> 18:20.597
I don't know
what he goona say.

18:20.665 --> 18:22.032
I have no idea.

18:22.100 --> 18:24.368
I already know
I sucked last service.

18:24.435 --> 18:26.804
But I know that,
any given second,

18:26.871 --> 18:28.806
Chef could tap you on
the shoulder and say, "go home."

18:28.873 --> 18:30.374
That makes me scared
as [Bleep].

18:30.441 --> 18:31.441
Sit down.

18:38.604 --> 18:41.172
(Announcer)
Hell's Kitchen is moments away
from opening.

18:41.240 --> 18:43.975
Right, let's go, guys, yes?
Get on your stations.

18:44.043 --> 18:45.877
(Announcer)
But one Chef...
Except you, Jillian.

18:45.945 --> 18:47.012
<i>I want</i>
<i>two minutes with you.</i>

18:47.079 --> 18:48.580
(Announcer)
Is wondering whether

18:48.647 --> 18:49.581
she'll make it
to dinner service.

18:49.648 --> 18:51.149
My stomach's in knots.

18:51.217 --> 18:53.051
I've never worked this h my l,

18:53.119 --> 18:54.853
and to get sent home now,

18:54.920 --> 18:57.255
that would just be
a straight kick in the face.

18:57.323 --> 18:58.289
Close the door.

18:58.357 --> 18:59.691
Okay, sit down.

19:01.694 --> 19:03.161
When you
first arrived here,

19:03.229 --> 19:05.830
you were not
100% certain of yourself.

19:05.898 --> 19:09.334
And I looked at you
as a bit of an underdog.

19:09.402 --> 19:10.702
Then you worked
bloody hard.

19:10.770 --> 19:13.571
<i>And you proved me wrong.</i>

19:13.639 --> 19:16.474
But the last
two dinner services...

19:16.542 --> 19:19.611
You seem that you have
lost your confidence.

19:19.678 --> 19:21.379
Why?

19:21.447 --> 19:23.114
I don't know.
When I suck, like,

19:23.182 --> 19:25.417
I get--I think I'm,
like, harder on myself

19:25.484 --> 19:27.152
than everyone else.

19:27.219 --> 19:29.454
'Cause I get so pissed
at myself when I [Bleep] Up.

19:31.424 --> 19:35.160
You are a strong,
determined girl

19:35.227 --> 19:37.695
with a great future.

19:37.763 --> 19:40.031
<i>But you've gotta stop</i>
<i>beating yourself up</i>

19:40.099 --> 19:41.466
at the first mistake.

19:41.534 --> 19:43.234
<i>And what</i>
<i>you've got to learn...</i>

19:43.302 --> 19:44.869
To fight back,

19:44.937 --> 19:46.638
you've got to find
that inner strength

19:46.705 --> 19:48.540
<i>that you can be</i>
<i>as good as anyone</i>

19:48.607 --> 19:50.708
that's in Hell's Kitchen
currently

19:50.776 --> 19:51.976
<i>if you bounce back.</i>

19:52.044 --> 19:53.211
Yes, Chef.

19:53.279 --> 19:54.879
You can do it.
Okay, Chef.

19:54.947 --> 19:57.215
We're opening in 15,
yes.

19:57.283 --> 19:59.684
Thank you, Chef.

19:59.752 --> 20:02.053
Talking to Chef Ramsay
is the pep talk I needed.

20:02.121 --> 20:05.523
To hear Chef Ramsay
be like, "you're good,

20:05.591 --> 20:07.058
you just need to focus."

20:07.126 --> 20:09.127
Like, it--it means
the world to me.

20:09.195 --> 20:11.463
Tonight is my night.

20:11.530 --> 20:13.565
He's chosen me
to be here for a reason,

20:13.632 --> 20:14.966
and I have to show him why.

20:15.034 --> 20:18.069
Okay, James.
Yes, Chef?

20:18.137 --> 20:20.071
Open Hell's Kitchen.
Let's go.

20:30.616 --> 20:32.217
Welcome to Hell's Kitchen.

20:32.284 --> 20:33.718
I'm gonna start
with the lobster spaghetti.

20:33.786 --> 20:35.186
I'll get the halibut.

20:35.254 --> 20:36.621
I'll take everything
on page one.

20:36.689 --> 20:39.023
<i>Everything</i>
<i>on page one.</i>

20:39.091 --> 20:41.693
(Announcer)
After two terrible
dinner services...

20:41.760 --> 20:43.695
Let's start
right from the very top.

20:43.762 --> 20:45.230
<i>One turbot salad,</i>
<i>two spaghetti, three scallop.</i>

20:45.297 --> 20:46.998
(All)
Yes, Chef.
<i>Good, let's go.</i>

20:47.066 --> 20:48.700
(Announcer)
Chef Ramsay is counting on

20:48.767 --> 20:51.169
the final four
to finally deliver.

20:51.237 --> 20:52.937
Walking right now
with spaghetti.

20:53.005 --> 20:53.838
I'm really pumped
for service tonight.

20:53.906 --> 20:55.473
We've got a lot to prove,

20:55.541 --> 20:57.408
and I am absolutely
going to show Chef

20:57.476 --> 20:58.776
that I can kick ass.

20:58.844 --> 20:59.911
Nona.
Yes?

20:59.979 --> 21:02.080
Nice color pasta.
Yes, Chef!

21:02.148 --> 21:04.015
<i>I want a scallop garnish.</i>
<i>Let's go.</i>

21:04.083 --> 21:05.183
Scallop garnish
right now, Chef.
Let's go.

21:08.988 --> 21:10.788
<i>Jillian...</i>

21:10.856 --> 21:12.790
That's delicious.
Thank you, Chef.

21:12.858 --> 21:13.925
Aw, man.

21:13.993 --> 21:15.426
I'm like, "hell yeah."

21:15.494 --> 21:17.662
I knew it tasted good,
'cause id it.

21:17.730 --> 21:19.130
<i>Russell, two scallops,</i>
<i>let's go.</i>

21:19.198 --> 21:20.198
Scallops in the window.

21:20.266 --> 21:21.733
I'm ready for service.

21:21.800 --> 21:23.568
You gotta stay
calm, cool, and collective,

21:23.636 --> 21:25.503
and push the food out;
That's the key to the night.

21:25.571 --> 21:26.905
<i>Scallops cooked</i>
<i>perfectly, let's go.</i>
Yes, Chef.

21:26.972 --> 21:28.173
I'm getting nervous.

21:28.240 --> 21:29.274
We've never kicked off
service like this.

21:29.341 --> 21:31.075
<i>Service, please.</i>

21:31.143 --> 21:32.310
It's good.

21:32.378 --> 21:33.978
Keep it going, guys, yes?

21:34.046 --> 21:35.914
This is night and day
from our last service.

21:35.981 --> 21:38.116
(All)
Yes, Chef!

21:38.184 --> 21:39.817
Coming with the risotto.

21:42.721 --> 21:44.989
This is
[Bleep] Me off.

21:46.892 --> 21:49.260
Stop!

21:49.328 --> 21:51.429
Come here, you.

21:51.497 --> 21:53.164
Come here.

21:53.232 --> 21:55.767
And you, as well.

21:55.834 --> 21:57.335
Have a [Bleep]
Good taste.

21:59.438 --> 22:01.573
Awesome.
It's [Bleep] Great.

22:01.640 --> 22:04.409
I love what's
happening right now.

22:04.476 --> 22:06.978
What's the first thing
that comes to your mouth?

22:07.046 --> 22:09.013
(Russell)
Pepper.

22:09.081 --> 22:12.517
Yeah, can we have some
risotto with the pepper, please?

22:12.585 --> 22:15.220
Re-fire.

22:15.287 --> 22:17.455
Three stunning risottos,
away.

22:17.523 --> 22:18.623
Yes, Chef.

22:18.691 --> 22:21.826
Sucks, sucks, sucks.

22:21.894 --> 22:22.994
Three minutes
out on that risotto.

22:23.062 --> 22:24.696
Scallops.

22:24.763 --> 22:25.863
[Indistinct]

22:27.933 --> 22:30.168
That is raw!

22:30.236 --> 22:31.869
Russell...
Yo?

22:33.639 --> 22:36.241
Yo? Yeah?
Oh, yo, hey. Yeah.

22:36.308 --> 22:37.976
Raw!

22:38.043 --> 22:40.245
That [Bleep] Is raw!

22:40.312 --> 22:41.279
[Bleep].

22:41.347 --> 22:42.647
[Scoffs]

22:42.715 --> 22:44.582
Mr. I-can-cook-a-scallop
like-nobody's-business

22:44.650 --> 22:45.950
puts up cold scallops.

22:46.018 --> 22:47.585
One minute on a scallop.

22:47.653 --> 22:49.320
Apparently,
you're not all that

22:49.388 --> 22:50.622
and a bag of chips
after all, are you?

22:50.689 --> 22:52.557
I don't wanna
lose the momentum now!

22:52.625 --> 22:54.559
'Cause everyone will start
[Bleep] Nodding off.

22:54.627 --> 22:56.227
This is not good.
We started off great.

22:56.295 --> 22:58.096
I don't know what happened;
It just went downhill.

22:58.163 --> 22:59.230
Go, go.
Scallop garnish, please.

22:59.298 --> 23:01.266
Coming with risotto.

23:01.333 --> 23:02.300
Garnish coming.

23:05.838 --> 23:06.871
Good.
Service, please.

23:06.939 --> 23:08.306
Let's go!

23:08.374 --> 23:09.807
(Announcer)
Nona and Russell have rebounded

23:09.875 --> 23:11.376
on the appetizers.

23:11.443 --> 23:13.044
You know where
you're going, yes?

23:13.112 --> 23:14.579
It's really good,
I love scallops.

23:14.647 --> 23:16.681
Coming with risotto.
Service, please.

23:16.749 --> 23:18.082
(Announcer)
And food is now
leaving the kitchen

23:18.150 --> 23:19.751
in a continual flow.

23:19.818 --> 23:21.319
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Service.</i>
It's good.

23:21.387 --> 23:22.053
(Announcer)
And as the team moves on

23:22.121 --> 23:23.254
to entrees...

23:23.322 --> 23:25.123
Entree, two Wellington,
three beef.

23:25.190 --> 23:26.391
<i>Let's go, two Wellington in.</i>
Yes, Chef.

23:26.458 --> 23:35.767
(Announcer)
The pressure shifts

23:35.834 --> 23:37.201
(all)
Yes, Chef.

23:37.269 --> 23:38.069
<i>Serving Wellingtons</i>
<i>all day.</i>

23:38.137 --> 23:39.370
All [Bleep] Meat!

23:39.438 --> 23:42.140
[Clanging]
Whoops!

23:42.207 --> 23:43.141
Come on, Trev,
stay in control.

23:43.208 --> 23:44.475
Yes, Chef.

23:44.543 --> 23:46.411
<i>Don't panic.</i>
Okay.

23:46.478 --> 23:48.012
Right off the bat, it was meat,
meat, meat, meat, meat.

23:48.080 --> 23:49.347
That's all it was.

23:49.415 --> 23:50.948
I'm shaking in my boots.
I'm nervous as hell.

23:51.016 --> 23:52.517
That's the only thing
going through my head.

23:52.584 --> 23:54.218
Checking
the first welly.

24:01.327 --> 24:03.895
<i>Trev...</i>

24:03.962 --> 24:05.496
Just calm down!

24:05.564 --> 24:07.965
Use your carving knife.

24:08.033 --> 24:10.201
It's serrated,
so it's hard on there.

24:10.269 --> 24:11.669
<i>Watch, watch, watch.</i>

24:11.737 --> 24:13.271
Find your mark,
fingers down...

24:13.339 --> 24:15.406
Gently on the [Bleep] Pastry.
Perfect.

24:15.474 --> 24:18.643
Yeah, I wanna see
your delicate touch again.

24:18.711 --> 24:20.678
Find your mark...

24:20.746 --> 24:23.348
Hold the pastry down,
let the knife do the work.

24:23.415 --> 24:24.849
Okay.
Perfect, let's go.

24:24.917 --> 24:26.050
Oh, my God.

24:26.118 --> 24:27.685
I don't understand
why Chef

24:27.753 --> 24:29.587
is over there
doing the meat for Trev.

24:29.655 --> 24:32.056
No oil in the pan.
You end up scorching the meat.

24:32.124 --> 24:33.591
Leave the oil in there.
It has to work, yes?

24:33.659 --> 24:34.792
It's like training wheels

24:34.860 --> 24:36.394
with the little freakin'

24:36.462 --> 24:38.730
boink, boink, boink, boink
on his bicycle.

24:38.797 --> 24:39.697
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Stay in control.</i>

24:39.765 --> 24:41.966
You got it.

24:42.034 --> 24:43.134
(Gordon)
Trev!

24:43.202 --> 24:44.836
Don't throw it
in there.

24:44.903 --> 24:46.671
Don't throw it in,
we'll just stay calm.

24:46.739 --> 24:48.639
When you throw in
a steak like that,

24:48.707 --> 24:50.108
I can tell you're panicking.
Outside, 30 seconds.

24:50.175 --> 24:51.242
Just out
that side door now,

24:51.310 --> 24:52.443
and fill up your lungs,
let's go.

24:54.146 --> 24:55.480
Close the [Bleep] Door.

24:55.547 --> 24:57.315
Big deep breath.
Calm, 30 seconds.

24:57.383 --> 24:59.817
Trev got kicked out

24:59.885 --> 25:01.486
and he had to go
take a deep breath,

25:01.553 --> 25:02.353
and I was just
kind of snickering.

25:02.421 --> 25:03.788
He looked hilarious.

25:03.856 --> 25:05.390
I can't help but laugh.

25:07.059 --> 25:09.794
Back out,
30 seconds, let's go.

25:09.862 --> 25:11.562
(Trev)
One, two, three, four,

25:11.630 --> 25:13.564
five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten.

25:13.632 --> 25:14.899
Come on, you know
how [Bleep] Counting goes.

25:14.967 --> 25:16.334
There you go.

25:16.402 --> 25:18.169
It's embarrassing.
It really is.

25:20.973 --> 25:23.741
Ready?

25:23.809 --> 25:24.675
Let's go, big boy.

25:27.513 --> 25:28.913
Stop panicking.
Calm.

25:28.981 --> 25:30.982
Busy, calm.
That's it, yeah?

25:31.049 --> 25:32.550
In the zone, yes?
Look at me in the eyes.

25:32.618 --> 25:33.718
In the [Bleep] Zone.
Zone.

25:33.786 --> 25:35.119
Let's go.

25:35.187 --> 25:36.387
Wipe down.
Wipe down.

25:36.455 --> 25:37.655
Let's go.
Garnish, please.

25:37.723 --> 25:39.090
Garnish coming
right now, Chef.

25:39.158 --> 25:41.192
Finally. Service.

25:41.260 --> 25:42.960
(Announcer)
Trev's meat cooked by
Chef Ramsay...

25:43.028 --> 25:44.228
<i>Beautiful sear</i>
<i>on that meat.</i>

25:44.296 --> 25:45.730
(Announcer)
Has met Chef Ramsay's approval,

25:45.798 --> 25:47.498
and now he's hoping
Trev's time-out

25:47.566 --> 25:48.933
will help him
to cook more calmly...

25:49.001 --> 25:50.868
<i>Trev, don't panic.</i>

25:50.936 --> 25:52.570
(Announcer)
And successfully deliver
his own entrees.

25:52.638 --> 25:54.138
Three Wellington,
one salmon, yes?

25:54.206 --> 25:55.106
(All)
Yes, Chef.

25:55.174 --> 25:56.073
All right, let's go,

25:56.141 --> 25:57.041
let's get this done.

25:57.109 --> 25:58.109
Let's go.

25:58.177 --> 25:59.510
I just need to stay focused.

25:59.578 --> 26:01.279
That's all I need to do.

26:01.346 --> 26:04.649
<i>I got one</i>
<i>Wellington here.</i>

26:04.716 --> 26:06.117
I got three Wellington,
one salmon,

26:06.185 --> 26:07.084
and I got one Wellington here.

26:07.152 --> 26:08.953
Who's got confused?

26:09.021 --> 26:10.721
Where's the other
two Wellingtons, buddy?

26:10.789 --> 26:12.256
Oh, I got confused.
<i>Trev!</i>

26:12.324 --> 26:13.491
Do you wanna go home?
<i>No, Chef!</i>

26:13.559 --> 26:17.962
[Suspenseful music]

26:18.030 --> 26:21.098
Ugh! Come here.
Come here, come here.

26:21.166 --> 26:22.433
<i>I said, "come here!"</i>

26:28.244 --> 26:30.401
(Announcer)
It's just over an hour
into dinner service.

26:30.601 --> 26:31.801
I've got 3 Wellington, 1 salmon

26:31.881 --> 26:32.781
and I got
one Wellington here.

26:32.849 --> 26:34.182
(Announcer)
And even after

26:34.250 --> 26:35.650
a personal tutorial
from Chef Ramsay

26:35.718 --> 26:37.152
on the meat station,

26:37.220 --> 26:38.820
Trev has managed
to mess up again...

26:38.888 --> 26:40.055
Where's the other
two Wellingtons, buddy?

26:40.122 --> 26:41.523
Oh, right here.
I got confused.

26:41.591 --> 26:43.191
(Announcer)
Stalling all the entrees.

26:43.259 --> 26:44.793
Trev, come here.
Come here.

26:44.861 --> 26:46.127
Me here. Out!

26:46.195 --> 26:47.462
<i>[Bleep] Out.</i>

26:47.530 --> 26:49.197
<i>[Bleep] Out.</i>
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

26:49.265 --> 26:50.966
All on his own.
Close the [Bleep] Door!

26:51.033 --> 26:54.536
Son of a bitch.

26:54.604 --> 26:55.937
I knew it was three.

26:56.005 --> 26:57.539
They were made,
they were cooked,

26:57.607 --> 26:58.306
they were ready,
they were perfect.

26:58.374 --> 26:59.508
I just space-cadeted

26:59.575 --> 27:01.243
because I didn't
set myself up properly.

27:01.310 --> 27:02.677
Three Wellington,
one salmon.

27:02.745 --> 27:04.212
Unbelievable!
Cooked perfectly!

27:04.280 --> 27:06.014
<i>Think!</i>
Come on, Trev.

27:06.082 --> 27:08.850
Get this together,
drive it home, get it done.

27:08.918 --> 27:12.120
Let's go.

27:12.188 --> 27:13.655
Slow down.
Yes, Chef.

27:13.723 --> 27:15.423
<i>Three Wellington,</i>
<i>one salmon.</i>

27:15.491 --> 27:17.392
Salmon's in the window,
you bring more Wellington.

27:17.460 --> 27:20.228
That tells me
you're not concentrating.

27:20.296 --> 27:22.097
Hey, slow down. Concentrate.
Okay.

27:22.164 --> 27:23.765
<i>All the way.</i>

27:26.302 --> 27:28.136
Service, please.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

27:28.204 --> 27:29.871
(Announcer)
The complete order

27:29.939 --> 27:30.772
has finally made it
out to the dining room.

27:30.840 --> 27:32.707
It's so good.

27:32.775 --> 27:34.743
(Announcer)
And now Chef Ramsay
is looking to Russell...

27:34.810 --> 27:36.378
Halibut, halibut sauce.

27:36.445 --> 27:38.179
(Announcer)
To keep the entrees moving.

27:38.247 --> 27:41.116
Russell,
I've got two halibut, yes?

27:41.183 --> 27:43.251
One's maximum color,
one's done perfectly.

27:43.319 --> 27:45.620
It's on the same table.

27:45.688 --> 27:47.389
You've got one
exactly the same as that?

27:47.456 --> 27:48.790
Yes, Chef. Yes, Chef.
Let's go.

27:48.858 --> 27:50.959
I made one mistake.
I did one halibut bad.

27:51.027 --> 27:52.460
He said it's not good enough,

27:52.528 --> 27:53.495
and I made him another one.

27:53.563 --> 27:55.297
No big deal.

27:57.266 --> 27:58.767
Russell.

27:58.834 --> 28:01.670
It's undercooked!

28:01.737 --> 28:04.306
It's raw!
[Bleep], come on!

28:04.373 --> 28:05.941
Get it back in!
Yes, Chef.

28:06.008 --> 28:08.276
He wants to show
that he's superman

28:08.344 --> 28:10.211
and he was trying to fly
something out

28:10.279 --> 28:11.246
that wasn't gonna fly;
He should've known better.

28:11.314 --> 28:13.081
[Bleep]. How?

28:13.149 --> 28:14.683
(Trev)
We don't need
a guy like that in charge.

28:14.750 --> 28:15.951
Can you fix it?
Yep.

28:16.018 --> 28:17.152
<i>I need</i>
<i>two minutes on that.</i>

28:17.219 --> 28:18.687
And I guess if
I have to be the guy,

28:18.754 --> 28:19.454
if I have to start
raising my voice,

28:19.522 --> 28:20.755
I'll do it.

28:20.823 --> 28:22.524
All right,
we're pushing it.

28:22.592 --> 28:23.858
We got two minutes.
What's the next ticket?

28:23.926 --> 28:24.893
Let's get that
rocking for garnish.

28:24.961 --> 28:26.261
<i>All garnish</i>
<i>to the window.</i>

28:26.329 --> 28:27.262
<i>Jillian, please.</i>
Garnish coming.

28:27.330 --> 28:29.230
Go, thank you.

28:29.298 --> 28:31.800
<i>Halibut, you're walking?</i>
Yep, halibut walking.

28:31.867 --> 28:33.301
<i>Thank you.</i>

28:33.369 --> 28:34.636
Thank you.

28:34.704 --> 28:36.338
Steaks following.

28:36.405 --> 28:38.340
Halibut's
perfectly cooked.

28:38.407 --> 28:40.475
Thank you.
Let's go, guys.

28:40.543 --> 28:42.077
(Announcer)
The final four have found
their groove.

28:42.144 --> 28:44.079
The lamb is excellent.

28:44.146 --> 28:45.981
(Announcer)
And entrees are leaving
the kitchen rapidly.

28:46.048 --> 28:47.349
Garnish to the window.
Garnish to the window.

28:49.185 --> 28:50.518
<i>Jillian...</i>
Yes, Chef!

28:50.586 --> 28:52.454
That's delicious.
Thank you, Chef.

28:52.521 --> 28:54.689
That pep talk from Chef Ramsay
before service,

28:54.757 --> 28:56.291
that got me pumped.

28:56.359 --> 28:58.059
Mash tasted delicious.
Let's go.

28:58.127 --> 28:59.127
Thank you, Chef.

28:59.195 --> 29:01.463
Chef Jillian in the house!

29:01.530 --> 29:03.331
We're almost there!

29:03.399 --> 29:05.200
Lats,
we got this.

29:05.267 --> 29:07.068
(Announcer)
With the finish line in sight...

29:07.136 --> 29:08.269
I think the last two
are gonna rely on me.

29:08.337 --> 29:09.337
<i>All I need is your salmon.</i>

29:09.405 --> 29:11.172
<i>(Russell)</i>
<i>I got you.</i>

29:11.240 --> 29:12.741
(Announcer)
It's up to enemies Trev
and Russell to work together.

29:12.808 --> 29:13.875
How long on a salmon?
Is it fired?

29:13.943 --> 29:15.143
It's gonna be
in a minute here.

29:15.211 --> 29:17.445
Well...It's not fired.

29:17.513 --> 29:19.481
Every time
Chef calls an order,

29:19.548 --> 29:21.016
you gotta wait until he fires it
before you can start cooking.

29:21.083 --> 29:22.617
I'd just be
prepared for it.

29:22.685 --> 29:24.319
Hold on, bro,
let me just take care of...

29:24.387 --> 29:25.987
That's fine.

29:26.055 --> 29:27.889
I'm trying to be
a step ahead of the game.

29:27.957 --> 29:29.257
Russell should be
working on the next one

29:29.325 --> 29:34.162
while thinking a couple
of more tickets ahead of time.

29:34.230 --> 29:35.163
<i>Two minutes to the window!</i>

29:35.231 --> 29:38.566
It's not even fired yet.

29:38.634 --> 29:41.436
It's not even fired.
I knew it.

29:41.504 --> 29:43.638
Hey, you asked me how long.
I gave you a time.

29:43.706 --> 29:45.573
Don't just sit there and say,
"I knew it."

29:45.641 --> 29:46.841
<i>(Jillian)</i>
<i>Don't yell, guys. Come on.</i>

29:46.909 --> 29:48.109
Okay, Trevor.

29:48.177 --> 29:49.911
If you tell me
to fire something,

29:49.979 --> 29:51.379
and then it's not fired
and it makes me look bad,

29:51.447 --> 29:52.781
you know
what's gonna happen.

29:52.848 --> 29:54.783
I'm gonna stick this size 12
so far up your [Bleep],

29:54.850 --> 29:56.151
dude, you're gonna be spitting
shoelaces for, like, a week.

29:56.218 --> 29:58.253
Dude, seriously.

29:58.320 --> 30:00.355
I'm not trying to [Bleep] You
over, Russ. Whatever.

30:00.423 --> 30:01.489
<i>(Russell)</i>
<i>Just shut up.</i>

30:01.557 --> 30:02.791
Come on, don't argue.

30:02.858 --> 30:04.526
Just be quiet
and let's finish.

30:04.593 --> 30:06.261
Those two fight so much.

30:06.328 --> 30:08.229
Russell's a bully,
and Trev's just [Bleep] Around,

30:08.297 --> 30:09.798
acting like
the [Bleep] Idiot.

30:09.865 --> 30:10.732
You guys wanna fail,
then fail.

30:10.800 --> 30:12.167
But not me.

30:12.234 --> 30:13.702
Come on, guys.
One halibut, one risotto.

30:13.769 --> 30:15.870
Salmon and a beef next.

30:15.938 --> 30:18.373
Let's go, let's go,
let's go.

30:18.441 --> 30:19.374
Halibut's in the window.

30:19.442 --> 30:23.378
There you go.

30:23.446 --> 30:24.813
Service, please.

30:24.880 --> 30:26.314
Another 30 seconds
on the risotto.

30:26.382 --> 30:27.582
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Come on, Nona.</i>

30:27.650 --> 30:29.184
Go, come back
for the risotto.

30:29.251 --> 30:30.952
(Announcer)
Chef Ramsay has sent the halibut

30:31.020 --> 30:32.353
out to the dining room
with the hopes

30:32.421 --> 30:33.588
that the risotto
will soon follow.

30:33.656 --> 30:35.123
Your risotto should
just be a few minutes.

30:35.191 --> 30:36.991
Okay. Can I just
smell your food?

30:37.059 --> 30:38.927
(Announcer)
but as the customer grows hungrier...

30:38.994 --> 30:40.729
Come on, Nona, let's go!
Yes, Chef.

30:40.796 --> 30:42.530
(Announcer)
Chef Ramsay grows impatient.

30:42.598 --> 30:44.132
<i>Risotto, please.</i>
Yes, Chef.

30:44.200 --> 30:46.134
Risotto.

30:46.202 --> 30:49.604
It's not even green.

30:51.140 --> 30:52.674
Oh, my God!

30:54.376 --> 30:56.711
Stop.
Come on.

30:56.779 --> 30:58.780
Yeah.
Let's go, you.

I'm not running away, Chef.

<i>Taste.</i>
<i>(Jillian)</i>
<i>No flavor.</i>

31:04.487 --> 31:05.620

31:05.688 --> 31:07.021
Again? I'm like,

31:07.089 --> 31:08.356
how do you [Bleep] Up
risottos twice?

31:08.424 --> 31:10.024
Bland!
Yes, Chef.

31:10.092 --> 31:11.960
On the back of it
being bland,

31:12.027 --> 31:13.728
it's [Bleep] Burned on
the bottom of the [Bleep] Pan.

31:13.796 --> 31:14.763
Aw, man.

31:14.830 --> 31:16.197
This is such a shame!

31:16.265 --> 31:17.398
Chef was pissed.
Is that your best?

31:17.466 --> 31:19.067
No, it's not my best.

31:19.135 --> 31:20.502
Well, [Bleep] Give me
your best or get out!

31:29.812 --> 31:31.750

Over two hours
into dinner service,

the final four--Jillian,
Nona, Russell, and Trev--

are just one
and a half tables away...

31:38.503 --> 31:40.270
From completing
dinner service.

Stop.
Come on.

31:50.949 --> 31:52.649

31:52.717 --> 31:54.451
Is that your best?
No, it's not my best.

31:54.519 --> 31:56.253
Well, [Bleep]
Give me your best.

31:56.321 --> 31:59.356
I knew it wasn't right,
and I sent it anyway.

31:59.424 --> 32:01.558
There's no excuse for it.

32:01.626 --> 32:03.193
Let's go.
How long on the regroup?

32:03.261 --> 32:06.597
It'll be
re-fire.

41:42.920 --> 41:44.253
(Announcer)
The final four are in

41:44.321 --> 41:45.888

dinner service of the season...

41:45.956 --> 41:47.557
Listen to me!
It's not good enough!

41:47.624 --> 41:49.959
You're not
gonna [Bleep] Screw me!

41:50.027 --> 41:52.395
(Announcer)
Not just because Chef Ramsay
is all over them...

41:52.463 --> 41:54.097
You're doing
the sides first,

41:54.164 --> 41:54.764
<i>and we're forgetting</i>
<i>the entrees!</i>

41:54.832 --> 41:56.432
Entrees first!

(Announcer)
But the Chefs
are all over each other.

41:58.535 --> 42:00.103

It's coming!

42:01.939 --> 42:04.207
Russ is a thug. He's a jocko.
He's a meathead.

42:04.274 --> 42:06.976
(Announcer)
Everybody is determined
to be in the final two.

42:07.044 --> 42:09.479
This is my t,
and I'm gonna [Bleep] Shine.

42:09.546 --> 42:10.880
(Announcer)
But their lack
of sportsmanship...

42:10.948 --> 42:11.981
Did you
hear what I said?

42:12.049 --> 42:14.050
Yes, Chef.
Your halibut is raw!

over the edge.

42:17.721 --> 42:19.455

Quit it.

42:19.523 --> 42:21.190
Come here, you.
You're [Bleep] Out.

42:21.258 --> 42:23.493
<i>Get out!</i>

42:23.560 --> 42:24.794
<i>Get out of here.</i>

42:24.862 --> 42:27.296

one crazy night...

42:29.666 --> 42:31.167

42:31.235 --> 42:33.069
You don't gotta yell.
I'm trying to help you out.

42:33.137 --> 42:34.904
You're the one that's yelling
at me, Jillian.

42:34.972 --> 42:36.339
(Announcer)
And makes it
