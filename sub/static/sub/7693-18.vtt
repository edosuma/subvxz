WEBVTT

00:07.508 --> 00:08.709
HEY, COULD I USE THIS?

00:08.709 --> 00:11.212
I NEED A PLACE TO STORE
MY TOENAIL CLIPPINGS.

00:12.583 --> 00:14.415
YOU SAVE YOUR TOENAILS?

00:14.415 --> 00:17.548
OF COURSE.
THEY'RE NATURE'S TOOTHPICKS.

00:17.548 --> 00:21.052
YOU DON'T EVEN WANT TO KNOW
WHAT HE FLOSSES WITH.

00:21.052 --> 00:22.753
YOU REALLY DON'T.

00:25.256 --> 00:27.698
HEY, GET AWAY FROM THAT.
IT'S NOT EMPTY!

00:27.698 --> 00:30.531
THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF
METALLIC NANOBOTS IN THERE!

00:30.531 --> 00:32.031
WELL, THEN,
WHY CAN'T I SEE THEM?

00:32.031 --> 00:34.435
BECAUSE THEY'RE
MICROSCOPICALLY SMALL.

00:34.435 --> 00:37.408
BUT YOU'RE MICROSCOPICALLY
SMALL AND I CAN STILL SEE YOU!

00:37.408 --> 00:41.542
NANOBOTS ARE SO TINY,
THEY'RE INVISIBLE TO
THE HUMAN EYE.

00:41.542 --> 00:44.575
HERE, I'LL SHOW YOU.
PUT THESE ON.

00:46.317 --> 00:47.748
WHOA!

00:47.748 --> 00:50.551
THEY FUNCTION LIKE
MINI-DOCTORS INSIDE
THE HUMAN BODY.

00:50.551 --> 00:53.254
WHEN PATIENTS SWALLOW THEM,
THEY'LL SEEK AND DESTROY

00:53.254 --> 00:55.626
ANY DISEASED CELLS
OR FOREIGN MATTER.

00:55.626 --> 01:00.761
OOH. I GOT A TENNIS BALL
AND A MINI STATUE OF LIBERTY
SOMEWHERE IN MY GUT.

01:00.761 --> 01:02.563
IT'S TIME TO SWALLOW
A SEARCH PARTY.

01:02.563 --> 01:05.336
NO! THOSE ARE VALUABLE.

01:05.336 --> 01:07.698
COME ON, LEO, WE DON'T WANT
TO STEP ON BROKEN GLASS.

01:07.698 --> 01:09.370
WHAT BROKEN GLASS?

01:09.370 --> 01:11.602
GIMME!

01:14.645 --> 01:16.107
RIGHT.

01:18.649 --> 01:20.711
OH HO HO, MAN!

01:20.711 --> 01:22.553
THOSE LITTLE GUYS
SURE RUN FAST!

01:22.553 --> 01:25.186
IF WE LOSE THESE,
MR. DAVENPORT WILL KILL US.

01:25.186 --> 01:28.389
GREAT! ONCE AGAIN, I HAVE
TO CLEAN UP YOUR MESS.

01:28.389 --> 01:30.090
JUST DON'T STEP ON THEM.
 HEY, DUDE, I GOT THIS.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.363
I'LL JUST GRAB A PAPER
TOWEL AND PICK 'EM UP.

01:32.363 --> 01:33.624
ADAM!

01:33.624 --> 01:36.467
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
BETTER GET THE VACUUM INSTEAD.

01:36.467 --> 01:38.369
STOP!
 I HEAR YA.

01:38.369 --> 01:39.730
BETTER GRAB THE MOP.

01:42.603 --> 01:45.636
THE WORLD'S FIRST BIONIC
SUPER-HUMANS.

01:45.636 --> 01:49.740
THEY'RE STRONGER THAN US,
FASTER, SMARTER.

01:49.740 --> 01:52.283
THE NEXT GENERATION
OF THE HUMAN RACE IS...

01:52.283 --> 01:54.245
LIVING IN MY BASEMENT?

01:54.245 --> 01:55.246

02:33.224 --> 02:35.226
STANDING IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE HALLWAY?

02:35.226 --> 02:36.827
I DON'T KNOW, BUT I THINK
IT MEANS WE GET

02:36.827 --> 02:39.330
SIX MORE WEEKS OF WINTER.

02:39.330 --> 02:43.294
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
INTRODUCING THE PRINCIPAL,

02:43.294 --> 02:46.667
A FOUR-FOOT-ELEVEN SPITFIRE
FROM PORTLAND, MAINE,

02:46.667 --> 02:50.371
TERRI PERRY!

02:55.676 --> 02:58.349
JUST THOUGHT I'D SPICE UP
THE MORNING ANNOUNCEMENTS.

02:58.349 --> 03:00.311
TAKES ME BACK TO MY DAYS
OF PLAYING SEMIPRO BALL

03:00.311 --> 03:01.852
IN ROMANIA.

03:01.852 --> 03:04.615
HERE YA GO, KID.
SOUVENIR.

03:06.757 --> 03:10.561
I'M SURE YOU'RE ALL WONDERING
WHY DEWEY THE DINGO IS HERE.

03:10.561 --> 03:12.523
EVERY YEAR BEFORE
THE BIG HOMECOMING GAME

03:12.523 --> 03:15.266
AGAINST THE DEERFIELD HIGH
LEAPIN' LLAMAS,

03:15.266 --> 03:17.568
SOME PUNK MANAGES
TO STEAL DEWEY.

03:17.568 --> 03:18.829
NO MATTER WHERE I PUT IT,

03:18.829 --> 03:20.931
THEY ALWAYS FIND A WAY
TO GET IT.

03:20.931 --> 03:22.473
MAYBE YOU SHOULD TRY
WEARING IT.

03:22.473 --> 03:24.635
THAT'LL KEEP PEOPLE AWAY.

03:24.635 --> 03:26.437
DO YOU REALLY WANT
TO GO THERE,

03:26.437 --> 03:28.509
SUZY SKINNY JEANS?

03:28.509 --> 03:31.942
ANYWHO, TO MAKE CERTAIN
THEY DON'T TAKE HIM THIS YEAR,

03:31.942 --> 03:34.385
I'M ASSIGNING
ROUND-THE-CLOCK SHIFTS.

03:34.385 --> 03:36.917
RIGHT. I'M GONNA GO
HIT THE HOT TUB.

03:36.917 --> 03:39.950
HEARD A COUPLE OF THINGS
POP WHEN I RAN OUT HERE.

03:42.623 --> 03:45.426
( scoffs )
TWO-MAN SHIFTS,
AND SHE PAIRED ME WITH YOU.

03:45.426 --> 03:46.427
MMM.

03:46.427 --> 03:49.900
GREAT. SO WE GOT ONE MAN.
WHO'S THE OTHER ONE?

03:54.265 --> 03:55.666
WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE?

03:55.666 --> 03:57.308
DOMINO DOMINATION?

03:57.308 --> 03:59.270
I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT DOMINOS,

03:59.270 --> 04:02.313
BUT IF IT MEANS GYM CLASS
IS CANCELED, I'M ALL FOR IT.

04:02.313 --> 04:03.944
OH, HEY, CAITLIN.

04:03.944 --> 04:06.277
ARE YOU DOING
THE DOMINO DOMINATION?

04:06.277 --> 04:07.718
"DOING"? NO.

04:07.718 --> 04:12.553
ANNIHILATING
EVERY COMPETITOR THAT
COMES MY WAY? YES!

04:14.254 --> 04:15.556
YOU MAY NOT KNOW THIS,
BUT I COME FROM

04:15.556 --> 04:18.358
FOUR GENERATIONS
OF DOMINO-DROPPERS.

04:18.358 --> 04:20.731
AND THAT'S SOMETHING
YOU'RE PROUD OF?

04:22.293 --> 04:24.735
I GOT STUCK WITH
SECOND PLACE LAST YEAR.

04:24.735 --> 04:26.567
IF IT HAPPENS AGAIN,
I'LL HAVE TO SHAVE MY HEAD,

04:26.567 --> 04:28.439
MOVE TO THE DESERT,
AND HOPE THE COYOTES

04:28.439 --> 04:30.841
WILL ACCEPT ME
AS ONE OF THEIR OWN.

04:30.841 --> 04:34.445
THAT'S SOMETHING A STABLE
PERSON WOULD SAY.

04:34.445 --> 04:37.408
SO, HOW DO THESE
COMPETITIONS WORK?

04:37.408 --> 04:40.551
YOU GET POINTS FOR
NUMBER OF DOMINOS TOPPLED
AND ORIGINALITY.

04:40.551 --> 04:43.314
MY DESIGNS ARE
SUPER ORIGINAL 'CAUSE, WELL,

04:43.314 --> 04:45.456
THERE'S ONLY ONE ME!

04:45.456 --> 04:47.558
AMEN TO THAT!

04:48.789 --> 04:50.491
DO YOU GUYS WANT
TO DO IT WITH ME?

04:50.491 --> 04:53.794
MY TEAMMATES JUST BAILED.
THEY COULDN'T HANDLE
THE PRESSURE.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.626
( laughingly )
THE PRESSURE OF DOMINOS?

04:55.626 --> 04:57.698
HA HA HA!

04:57.698 --> 04:59.400
SORRY.

04:59.400 --> 05:03.033
I JUST WISH I DIDN'T HAVE
TO SET IT ALL UP BY MYSELF.

05:03.033 --> 05:05.075
WELL, HEY,
WE'LL HELP YOU.
THAT SOUNDS FUN.

05:05.075 --> 05:07.378
UH, NO IT DOES NOT.
AND WHO IS "WE"?

05:07.378 --> 05:10.811
OKAY, COME ON, LEO,
WHAT ELSE DO YOU HAVE
GOING ON TODAY?

05:10.811 --> 05:13.944
ANYTHING. I HAVE
ANYTHING ELSE GOING ON.

05:15.716 --> 05:17.087
FINE. I'LL DO IT.

05:17.087 --> 05:18.689
GREAT.

05:18.689 --> 05:21.522
ON ONE CONDITION.

05:21.522 --> 05:24.695
I GET TO BE THE ONE WHO
KNOCKS OVER THE FIRST DOMINO.

05:24.695 --> 05:26.427
YOU CAN'T BE THE TIPPER!

05:26.427 --> 05:28.359
THE TIPPER
GETS ALL THE GLORY.

05:28.359 --> 05:30.531
I'M ALWAYS THE TIPPER!

05:30.531 --> 05:33.764
WELL, GIVE MY BEST
TO THE COYOTES.

05:35.466 --> 05:37.408
FINE!

05:37.408 --> 05:38.969
YOU CAN BE THE TIPPER!

05:41.412 --> 05:42.773
IT WILL BE TEAM LEO.

05:42.773 --> 05:44.375
I WILL BREAK YOU IN HALF.

05:44.375 --> 05:45.846
TEAM CAITLIN IT IS.

05:48.519 --> 05:49.720
THIS IS A WASTE OF TIME.

05:49.720 --> 05:52.383
I COULD BE DOING
MY HOMEWORK!

05:52.383 --> 05:54.425
I KNOW, AND I COULD BE
STANDING IN FRONT OF A MIRROR,

05:54.425 --> 05:56.887
SQUISHING MY FACE TO SEE
HOW I'LL LOOK WHEN I'M OLD.

05:56.887 --> 05:59.530
OOH! THIS IS A WEEK
BEFORE MY 53rd BIRTHDAY.

06:01.962 --> 06:03.864
I'M GOING TO THE BATHROOM.
WATCH THE DINGO.

06:03.864 --> 06:07.097
WELL, HURRY BACK OR YOU WON'T
GET TO SEE MY BIRTHDAY PRESENT.

06:07.097 --> 06:08.799
FACELIFT!

06:10.100 --> 06:12.573
EXCUSE ME.
UH, I'M NEW HERE.

06:12.573 --> 06:14.805
IS THERE A TRICK
TO THE VENDING MACHINE?

06:14.805 --> 06:16.707
MY TRAIL MIX GOT STUCK.
 AH.

06:16.707 --> 06:19.149
TRAIL MIX. GOOD CALL.
IT'S IN SEASON.

06:19.149 --> 06:21.652
I'M ADAM.
 GRIFFIN.

06:21.652 --> 06:25.085
WELL, GRIFFIN,
I FIND THE EARTHQUAKE
METHOD WORKS BEST.

06:25.085 --> 06:26.487
SEE, IT STARTS
WITH A RUMBLE,

06:26.487 --> 06:28.459
THEN A BIG SHAKE...

06:29.960 --> 06:31.422
THEN A PAUSE,

06:31.422 --> 06:32.563
THEN AN AFTERSHOCK...

06:34.965 --> 06:36.527
AND BAM!

06:37.828 --> 06:40.571
8.0 ON
THE DELICIOUS SCALE.

06:41.602 --> 06:44.034
ADAM, WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE DINGO?

06:44.034 --> 06:46.607
I DON'T KNOW. I WAS HELPING
THE NEW KID, GRIFFIN, WITH
THE VENDING MACHINE.

06:46.607 --> 06:48.839
WHAT? THERE IS NO
NEW KID NAMED GRIFFIN.

06:48.839 --> 06:51.011
HE LIED TO YOU!

06:51.011 --> 06:54.044
HE MUST HAVE
BEEN FROM DEERFIELD.
HE STOLE THE DINGO!

06:54.044 --> 06:55.886
HE LIED TO ME?

06:55.886 --> 06:58.589
WELL, THAT DOESN'T SOUND
LIKE GRIFFIN AT ALL!

06:58.589 --> 07:00.020
GREAT.

07:00.020 --> 07:01.552
NOW I HAVE TO GO GET
THE DINGO BACK

07:01.552 --> 07:02.823
BEFORE PERRY FINDS OUT.

07:02.823 --> 07:05.596
ONCE AGAIN, I HAVE TO
CLEAN UP YOUR MESS.

07:05.596 --> 07:07.598
WAIT, NO. I'LL
SNEAK INTO DEERFIELD
AND GET IT BACK.

07:07.598 --> 07:09.660
MY FRIEND GRIFFIN
GOES THERE. HE CAN
HELP ME OUT.

07:14.204 --> 07:16.737
YOU GUYS ARE DOING
A GREAT JOB.

07:16.737 --> 07:18.909
JUST ONE QUICK QUESTION--

07:18.909 --> 07:21.041
ARE YOU TRYING TO RUIN
MY LIFE?

07:21.041 --> 07:23.644
TO BE HONEST, YOUR LIFE
WAS KIND OF A MESS

07:23.644 --> 07:25.075
BEFORE WE GOT HERE.

07:25.075 --> 07:28.448
( mocking laughter )

07:28.448 --> 07:30.781
I SPECIFICALLY TOLD YOU
THE SPACES MUST BE

07:30.781 --> 07:32.623
HALF AN INCH
TO TWO-THIRDS APART.

07:32.623 --> 07:34.785
MORE THAN THAT,
AND THE TOPPLE IS GONE.

07:34.785 --> 07:37.958
WE'LL HAVE NO TOPPLE!

07:37.958 --> 07:40.791
OKAY. CAITLIN,

07:40.791 --> 07:44.895
I KNOW THIS IS ONLY
THE 83rd TIME YOU'VE
MADE US START OVER,

07:44.895 --> 07:47.498
BUT WE'VE BEEN WORKING
FOR HOURS.

07:47.498 --> 07:48.799
HOW 'BOUT A BREAK?

07:48.799 --> 07:51.471
WINNERS DON'T TAKE
BREAKS, BREE! UGH!

07:53.073 --> 07:55.676
UH, WE'RE IN
A DOMINO COMPETITION.

07:55.676 --> 07:58.579
I'M PRETTY SURE NO ONE
HERE IS A WINNER.

07:59.650 --> 08:02.152
THAT'S IT!
TAKE A LAP, LEO.

08:02.152 --> 08:05.616
THIS MIGHT BE THE FIRST TIME
I ACTUALLY ENJOY RUNNING.

08:08.559 --> 08:10.961
ISN'T THIS
THE BEST TIME EVER?

08:10.961 --> 08:14.595
IF I SAY NO,
CAN I TAKE A LAP TOO?

08:14.595 --> 08:16.697
HEH HEH HEH HEH.

08:22.202 --> 08:24.605
GO LLAMAS! CA-CA! CA-CA!

08:26.637 --> 08:29.109
ADAM, HAVE YOU FOUND
THE DINGO YET?

08:29.109 --> 08:30.881
NO. I'VE CHECKED EVERYWHERE
BUT THE LOCKER ROOM.

08:30.881 --> 08:32.813
IT'S GOT TO BE
IN HERE SOMEWHERE.

08:32.813 --> 08:36.616
OKAY, BUT BE DISCREET.

08:36.616 --> 08:37.618
RIGHT.

08:43.953 --> 08:47.728
THAT'S ON ME FOR THINKING
YOU KNOW WHAT "DISCREET" MEANS!

08:50.631 --> 08:53.604
( gasps ) DEWEY!

08:53.604 --> 08:55.135
SHH! SOMEONE'S COMING!

09:02.773 --> 09:04.845
WHEW, THAT WAS CLOSE.

09:04.845 --> 09:06.116
D'OH!

09:10.050 --> 09:12.022
MNH-MNH, MNH-MNH!

09:12.022 --> 09:13.724
UH-HUH.

09:13.724 --> 09:15.255
UH-HUH.

09:15.255 --> 09:17.758
OOP! NO! NAAAAGGHHH!

09:17.758 --> 09:21.231
JUST... TELL ME
WHERE IT GOES!

09:22.292 --> 09:23.894
WOW!

09:23.894 --> 09:26.637
I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT
I AM REALLY IMPRESSED

09:26.637 --> 09:29.239
BY THE WAY THAT YOU'VE ALL
WORKED SO HARD

09:29.239 --> 09:34.775
TO METICULOUSLY CRAFT
SUCH BEAUTIFUL WORKS OF ART.

09:34.775 --> 09:37.577
STARTING CHECK!
STARTING CHECK!

09:37.577 --> 09:40.210
( laughing )

09:40.210 --> 09:42.913
WELL, MY WORK HERE IS DONE.

09:42.913 --> 09:45.956
HAPPY BUILDING,
DOMI-NOBODIES.

09:48.759 --> 09:50.721
CAITLIN, I AM STARVING.

09:50.721 --> 09:52.623
CAN WE PLEASE STOP
FOR A SNACK?

09:52.623 --> 09:55.595
OH, SURE, LEO.
LET ME TELL YOU
TONIGHT'S SPECIAL.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.898
WE HAVE A LOVELY
CHILEAN SEA BASS

09:57.898 --> 10:01.632
WITH A DELICIOUS SIDE
OF GET BACK TO WORK!

10:02.873 --> 10:04.635
SHE IS IMPOSSIBLE.

10:04.635 --> 10:06.907
I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE.

10:06.907 --> 10:08.038
I'M QUITTING.

10:08.038 --> 10:09.710
WE CAN'T QUIT NOW.

10:09.710 --> 10:13.143
I'M A TIP-TOP TIPPER,
AND I NEED TO TIP.

10:13.143 --> 10:16.616
THEN WHY DON'T WE
FORM OUR OWN TEAM?

10:16.616 --> 10:17.818
YOU COME UP WITH A DESIGN,

10:17.818 --> 10:19.389
AND I'LL SET IT UP
WITH MY SUPER SPEED.

10:19.389 --> 10:21.321
AND YA STILL GET TO TIP.

10:21.321 --> 10:22.923
OKAY, I'LL DO IT.

10:22.923 --> 10:27.227
BUT YOU HAVE TO TELL
SEÑORITA STRAITJACKET.

10:27.227 --> 10:28.929
DEAL.

10:28.929 --> 10:32.763
CAITLIN, WE NEED TO TALK.

10:32.763 --> 10:35.666
OKAY, AS LONG AS IT'S
NOT ABOUT FOOD OR A BREAK

10:35.666 --> 10:38.168
OR ME TREATING YOU
LIKE HUMANS.

10:38.168 --> 10:40.771
LOOK, THIS ISN'T
WORKING OUT,

10:40.771 --> 10:43.914
SO LEO AND I ARE
FORMING OUR OWN TEAM.

10:43.914 --> 10:45.946
WHAT? BUT--!

10:45.946 --> 10:48.348
( comical nonsense sounds )

10:49.649 --> 10:50.851
OKAY.

10:52.823 --> 10:54.785
I RESPECT YOUR DECISION.

10:54.785 --> 10:56.727
MAY THE BEST MAN WIN.

10:57.888 --> 11:00.230
ARE YOU TRYING
TO BREAK MY HAND?

11:00.230 --> 11:02.763
NO.
IS IT WORKING?

11:07.738 --> 11:09.039
( gasps )

11:09.039 --> 11:11.371
DON'T BE SCARED.
IT'S NOT A REAL DINGO.

11:11.371 --> 11:15.746
IT'S ME, YOUR BROTHER ADAM,
IN A DINGO COSTUME.

11:15.746 --> 11:19.379
GREAT, YOU GOT IT BACK,
BUT WHY ARE YOU WEARING IT?

11:19.379 --> 11:21.912
CHASE, YOU CAN'T
HAVE A DINGO COSTUME
AND NOT PUT IT ON.

11:21.912 --> 11:23.714
IT'S AN UNWRITTEN RULE,

11:23.714 --> 11:25.716
SORT OF LIKE HOW
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WASH
YOUR LEGS OR FEET

11:25.716 --> 11:28.058
BECAUSE THE SHOWER WATER
TRICKLES DOWN.

11:28.058 --> 11:29.890
Principal Perry:
YEAH, OKAY, BYE!

11:29.890 --> 11:31.361
PERRY'S COMING!

11:33.063 --> 11:35.866
I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE
WITH THE PRINCIPAL
OVER AT DEERFIELD.

11:35.866 --> 11:37.868
HE SAID THAT SOMEONE
STOLE THEIR LLAMA.

11:37.868 --> 11:39.730
I HOPE NONE OF YOU
WERE DUMB ENOUGH
TO DO THAT

11:39.730 --> 11:41.301
BECAUSE IT
WOULD BE ILLEGAL,

11:41.301 --> 11:43.133
AND I CAN'T HAVE
JOHNNY LAW

11:43.133 --> 11:45.906
BREATHING DOWN
MY NECK AGAIN!

11:45.906 --> 11:47.107
AGAIN?

11:47.107 --> 11:49.740
LET'S JUST SAY I'M ON
A LOT OF LISTS.

11:51.812 --> 11:55.385
ADAM, PLEASE TELL ME
YOU DID NOT BRING
THEIR LLAMA HERE.

11:55.385 --> 11:58.718
OF COURSE NOT.

11:58.718 --> 11:59.890
I BROUGHT IT HERE.

12:09.499 --> 12:11.932
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU STOLE
A LLAMA AND BROUGHT IT HERE.

12:11.932 --> 12:13.764
WELL, I COULDN'T
BRING IT TO SCHOOL,

12:13.764 --> 12:15.165
IT'S THE FIRST PLACE
THEY'D LOOK.

12:15.165 --> 12:17.167
PLUS, I WANTED
TO SHOW IT THE HOUSE.

12:17.167 --> 12:19.439
THE POOR GUY'S STUCK
OUTDOORS ALL DAY.

12:20.510 --> 12:22.372
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

12:22.372 --> 12:24.244
I WANTED TO TEACH
THOSE DEERFIELD JERKS

12:24.244 --> 12:27.117
THAT IF THEY STEAL FROM US,
THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES.

12:27.117 --> 12:31.021
SO YOU TAUGHT THEM
A LESSON ABOUT STEALING
BY STEALING?

12:31.021 --> 12:34.124
I SEE YOUR POINT.
I STOLE THEIR IDEA.

12:35.385 --> 12:37.227
UH! GROSS!

12:37.227 --> 12:38.488
AH.

12:38.488 --> 12:40.190
YEP, HE'S A LICKER,

12:40.190 --> 12:41.461
LIKE ME.

12:44.264 --> 12:45.365
OH, NO.

12:45.365 --> 12:46.967
IT'S OUR TURN
TO WATCH THE DINGO.

12:46.967 --> 12:49.139
PRINCIPAL PERRY THOUGHT
WE DID SUCH A GOOD JOB,

12:49.139 --> 12:51.441
SHE REWARDED US BY
GIVING US ANOTHER SHIFT!

12:51.441 --> 12:55.275
AH. SHE'S ALWAYS
THINKING OF US.
WHAT A GIVER.

12:55.275 --> 12:58.508
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?
I CAN'T DEAL WITH THE LLAMA

12:58.508 --> 13:00.080
AND GO WATCH THE DINGO.

13:00.080 --> 13:01.952
HEY, NO WORRIES.
I'LL WATCH THE LLAMA.

13:01.952 --> 13:05.315
I WANT TO SEE WHAT
HE LOOKS LIKE IN SOCKS.

13:05.315 --> 13:07.818
NO, NO WAY,
BECAUSE IT ALWAYS
STARTS OUT WITH SOCKS,

13:07.818 --> 13:10.821
AND THEN IT ENDS UP
WITH A LLAMA IN SKI PANTS
ON A TRAMPOLINE,

13:10.821 --> 13:12.292
AND NO ONE WANTS TO SEE THAT.

13:12.292 --> 13:15.265
EVERYBODY WANTS TO SEE THAT.

13:15.265 --> 13:17.868
ALL THE SAME,
WE'RE NOT DOING IT.

13:17.868 --> 13:20.871
GO TAKE CARE OF THE DINGO,
AND I'LL FIX THIS.

13:20.871 --> 13:22.432
FINE.

13:22.432 --> 13:24.534
JUST LET ME SAY GOODBYE
TO LORENZO LLAMA.

13:26.877 --> 13:29.980
WHO'S A GOOD BOY?
YOU'RE A GOOD BOY.

13:29.980 --> 13:31.241
MWAH.

13:31.241 --> 13:34.044
MMM. TASTES LIKE CHICKEN.

13:34.044 --> 13:35.585
GO!

13:40.450 --> 13:42.052
THE NANOBOTS!
BAD LLAMA!

13:42.052 --> 13:43.453
BAD LLAMA!

13:46.126 --> 13:48.198
OKAY, IF YOU AND I ARE
GONNA BE SPENDING

13:48.198 --> 13:51.101
ANY KIND OF TIME TOGETHER,
YOU'RE GONNA NEED A MINT.

13:54.364 --> 13:55.835
IS IT READY?

13:55.835 --> 13:57.537
YEAH. HERE'S THE DESIGN.

13:57.537 --> 13:59.609
BETTER HURRY.
DINNER BREAK'S ALMOST OVER.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.172
GOT IT.

14:09.619 --> 14:11.081
WHOA.

14:11.081 --> 14:12.883
FIVE THOUSAND DOMINOS
IN THREE SECONDS.

14:12.883 --> 14:15.285
DOMIN HOLLA'!

14:15.285 --> 14:17.928
DOMI-NO-YOU-DIDN'T.

14:20.130 --> 14:21.431
( gasps )

14:22.632 --> 14:25.135
I'M A PRETTY PRINCESS
AND PEOPLE LOVE ME.

14:25.135 --> 14:27.537
I'M A PRETTY PRINCESS
AND PEOPLE LOVE ME.

14:27.537 --> 14:28.598
HEY, CAITLIN.

14:28.598 --> 14:30.600
I WAS GONE FOR A HALF HOUR.

14:30.600 --> 14:32.872
HOW DID YOU SET ALL THESE UP?

14:32.872 --> 14:34.574
IT'S AMAZING HOW MUCH
YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH

14:34.574 --> 14:37.407
WHEN YOU'RE NOT
OUT OF YOUR MIND.

14:39.109 --> 14:40.550
I'M GONNA LOSE.

14:40.550 --> 14:41.982
OUI, MADAME.

14:41.982 --> 14:43.353
I'M FINISHED.

14:43.353 --> 14:44.354
FINI.

14:44.354 --> 14:46.616
MY LIFE IS OVER.

14:46.616 --> 14:50.020
I ONLY TOOK
ONE YEAR OF FRENCH.
LET'S KEEP IT SIMPLE.

14:53.493 --> 14:55.926
HOW'S IT GOING?
WHAT'S UP, MAN?

14:57.667 --> 15:00.330
( gasps )
I CAN'T DO THAT!

15:00.330 --> 15:02.332
YOU NAUGHTY DINGO, YOU!

15:03.633 --> 15:05.335
ADAM, WE GOT
A BIG PROBLEM!

15:05.335 --> 15:06.906
WE? IT'S NOT MY FAULT

15:06.906 --> 15:09.209
YOUR HAIRCUT MAKES YOU
LOOK LIKE A LADY GOLFER.

15:10.610 --> 15:12.082
WHAT? NO!

15:12.082 --> 15:14.244
THE LLAMA ATE
ALL OF THE NANOBOTS.

15:14.244 --> 15:17.047
THEIR BIOLOGY'S DIFFERENT.
THERE'S NO TELLING
HOW IT'LL REACT.

15:17.047 --> 15:19.119
WHY WAS THE DEERFIELD LLAMA

15:19.119 --> 15:21.491
OUTSIDE
STRADDLING MY HATCHBACK?

15:23.693 --> 15:25.956
HE'S FULL OF HIGHLY
UNSTABLE NANOBOTS,

15:25.956 --> 15:28.098
AND YOU BROUGHT HIM HERE?

15:28.098 --> 15:30.300
BET YOU WISH WE STUCK
TO SKI PANTS NOW.

15:35.035 --> 15:36.936
IT'S OKAY.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.438
I SPEAK LLAMA.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.940
WHEN HE SPITS,
IT JUST MEANS HE LIKES ME.

15:42.712 --> 15:45.645
FYI, IF I SPIT ON YOU,
IT DOES NOT MEAN I LIKE YOU.

15:47.147 --> 15:49.279
OH WHOA!
HE'S GETTIN' FRISKY.

15:49.279 --> 15:50.950
BETTER GRAB MY LASSO.

15:50.950 --> 15:53.123
WORKED A COUPLE OF RODEOS
DURING COLLEGE.

15:53.123 --> 15:55.655
NOBODY COULD
STAY ON ME FOR MORE
THAN THREE SECONDS.

15:58.588 --> 16:00.730
ADAM, WE HAVE
TO DO SOMETHING.

16:00.730 --> 16:03.133
HEY, LORENZO ATE
THE NANOBOTS ON YOUR WATCH.

16:03.133 --> 16:05.165
THIS IS YOUR PROBLEM.

16:05.165 --> 16:08.368
ALL RIGHT. ANYBODY
WHO DOESN'T WANT TO END UP
FACEDOWN AND HOGTIED,

16:08.368 --> 16:10.040
OUT OF MY WAY!

16:11.401 --> 16:13.673
YEEHAW!

16:18.448 --> 16:22.212
GET OVER HERE!
COME ON! I GOT YA!

16:22.212 --> 16:23.583
OHH!

16:23.583 --> 16:25.655
WE GOT A FIGHTER!

16:25.655 --> 16:27.057
AH!

16:27.057 --> 16:30.190
( audibly struggling )
QUIT FIGHTING!

16:31.721 --> 16:35.565
HE FOUGHT HARD, BUT ONCE
I GOT HIS HEAD IN A LEG LOCK,

16:35.565 --> 16:37.267
IT WAS PRETTY MUCH OVER.

16:38.698 --> 16:40.670
KEEP AN EYE ON HIM, BOYS.

16:40.670 --> 16:43.103
HE'LL MISS ME.
THEY ALWAYS DO.

16:46.536 --> 16:48.508
DO YOU KNOW HOW EXPENSIVE
THOSE NANOBOTS ARE?

16:48.508 --> 16:49.709
WE GOTTA GET THEM OUT.

16:49.709 --> 16:51.481
WELL, HOW DO YOU
DO IT ON HUMANS?

16:51.481 --> 16:53.313
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO EXTRACT
THEM INDIVIDUALLY,

16:53.313 --> 16:55.245
BUT WITH THIS MANY,
IT COULD TAKE DAYS!

16:58.148 --> 17:01.621
( trilling sound )

17:01.621 --> 17:04.094
OH, NO. OH, NO, A BUNCH
OF THEM ARE GATHERING

17:04.094 --> 17:05.595
IN THE SALIVARY GLANDS.

17:05.595 --> 17:08.027
THEY'RE PREPARING
TO ACTIVATE.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.028
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

17:09.028 --> 17:11.101
IT MEANS THAT THE NEXT
TIME HE SPITS...

17:13.333 --> 17:16.066
IT'LL LEAVE A MARK.

17:18.508 --> 17:20.770
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

17:20.770 --> 17:22.811
IT'S TIPPIN' TIME.

17:26.816 --> 17:29.048
Adam: INCOMING!

17:33.553 --> 17:35.825
NO!

18:25.305 --> 18:29.108
( applause )

18:35.815 --> 18:38.588
( screams and shouting )

18:40.620 --> 18:42.622
ADAM, WE HAVE
TO DO SOMETHING.

18:42.622 --> 18:44.123
HURRY, HELP ME THINK.

18:44.123 --> 18:47.497
WOW. THAT'S SOMETHING
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SAY.

18:50.530 --> 18:53.703
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?
IT'S NOT LIKE I CAN JUST
PULL AN IDEA OUT OF MY HEAD

18:53.703 --> 18:55.235
WITH A GIANT IDEA MAGNET.

18:55.235 --> 18:56.506
( girl screams )

18:56.506 --> 18:58.508
MAGNET! YES!

18:58.508 --> 19:00.210
THE NANOBOTS ARE METALLIC.

19:00.210 --> 19:02.172
WE CAN USE A MAGNET TO PULL
THEM OUT OF THE LLAMA.

19:02.172 --> 19:05.715
ADAM, YOU ARE A GENI--

19:05.715 --> 19:07.177
THAT WAS A GOOD IDEA.

19:11.251 --> 19:12.482
( low tone )

19:12.482 --> 19:14.854
OKAY, HOLD UP THE MAGNET.
I'LL GUIDE YOU.

19:17.527 --> 19:20.590
( whirring sound )

19:20.590 --> 19:22.832
OKAY, THEY'RE GATHERING
IN THE FEMUR.

19:22.832 --> 19:25.235
GOT IT. AND A FEMUR
WOULD BE A...?

19:25.235 --> 19:27.267
LEG. MOVE IT UP.

19:27.267 --> 19:29.439
OKAY, BUT I DON'T SEE
HOW THIS IS HELPING.

19:32.272 --> 19:34.474
NO, ADAM, THE LLAMA LEG.

19:35.705 --> 19:37.247
NOW, BANK LEFT.

19:37.247 --> 19:39.649
NO, LEFT. LEFT!

19:39.649 --> 19:40.850
MY LEFT OR LLAMA LEFT?

19:40.850 --> 19:42.912
THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT
YOU'RE DOING LEFT!

19:45.415 --> 19:48.318
YOU'RE GETTING CLOSER.
CLOSER.

19:48.318 --> 19:50.360
NOW MOVE UP.

19:50.360 --> 19:53.192
PULL UP! PULL UP!

19:54.764 --> 19:57.297
( llama belches )

19:57.297 --> 19:58.698
NICE!

19:58.698 --> 20:00.800
ADAM, THANK YOU.
YOU TOTALLY BAILED ME OUT.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.532
GOOD NEWS!

20:02.532 --> 20:05.235
DEERFIELD JUST WANTS
THEIR LLAMA BACK,
NO QUESTIONS ASKED.

20:05.235 --> 20:06.906
MUSCLES, LADY-LOCKS,
GET ON IT.

20:09.939 --> 20:12.782
HE WON'T BUDGE.
I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING
WRONG WITH HIM.

20:12.782 --> 20:16.215
OH, NO. MAYBE WE DIDN'T
GET ALL THE NANOBOTS OUT.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.918
QUIT STALLING!
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH--

20:23.222 --> 20:25.625
DOES THAT MEAN HE LIKES YOU?

20:36.406 --> 20:38.007
CONGRATULATIONS, GUYS.

20:38.007 --> 20:40.510
I WAS A JERK. YOU
TOTALLY DESERVED TO WIN.

20:40.510 --> 20:42.842
HEY, SECOND PLACE
IS NOTHING TO SNEEZE AT.

20:42.842 --> 20:45.545
YEAH, BUT IT'S NOT
AS GOOD AS FIRST.

20:47.377 --> 20:50.580
NO, LEO'S RIGHT.
I DESERVED TO LOSE.

20:52.552 --> 20:56.386
ACTUALLY, CAITLIN,
WE HAVE A CONFESSION TO MAKE.

20:56.386 --> 20:57.587
NO WE DON'T!

20:59.389 --> 21:01.291
( sighs )
LEO AND I CHEATED.

21:01.291 --> 21:02.562
I KNEW IT! I KNEW IT!

21:02.562 --> 21:04.834
CHEATERS! THEY CHEATED!

21:04.834 --> 21:07.797
HEY, HEY!
PRETTY PRINCESS,
PRETTY PRINCESS!

21:09.599 --> 21:11.301
LOOK, WE'RE REALLY SORRY.

21:11.301 --> 21:13.643
IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO
TO MAKE IT UP TO YOU?

21:13.643 --> 21:15.945
WELL... NATIONALS
ARE NEXT MONTH.

21:15.945 --> 21:18.478
THEY'RE IN OMAHA,
SO MY MOM WILL HAVE
TO DRIVE US.

21:18.478 --> 21:19.779
HER CAR'S A 2-SEATER,

21:19.779 --> 21:24.414
BUT I'M SURE YOU CAN FIT FOUR
IF WE ALL SNUGGLE REAL TIGHT.

21:25.555 --> 21:28.287
YOU'LL LIKE MY MOM.
SHE'S A LOT LIKE ME...

21:28.287 --> 21:30.390
BUT WAY MORE INTENSE!

21:31.691 --> 21:32.862
HEY!

21:32.862 --> 21:35.525
GET BACK HERE!

21:35.525 --> 21:38.468
