23:22.368 --> 23:23.903
‐ I thought it was falling off.

23:23.969 --> 23:25.271
‐ Well, this suite
is a lot nicer

23:25.304 --> 23:26.772
than the one we had
last time.

23:26.805 --> 23:28.841
‐ Well, remember, last time
there was a wedding here.

23:28.874 --> 23:31.143
That's why Daddy had them
put us on the other side,

23:31.176 --> 23:32.778
so you guys wouldn't
be up all night.

23:32.811 --> 23:35.281
‐ Oh, yeah.
The wedding.

23:35.314 --> 23:37.082
‐ Yeah, I remember
I lost my ski

23:37.116 --> 23:39.351
and Dad had to piggyback me
down the hill.

23:39.385 --> 23:40.719
‐ That wasn't here.
That was Wolf Creek.

23:40.753 --> 23:42.721
‐ Yes, it was.
It was still Colorado.

23:42.755 --> 23:43.756
God.
‐ Oh...

23:43.789 --> 23:46.458
remember when Mom brought
a whole suitcase

23:46.492 --> 23:48.794
of just cheese and bread?

23:48.827 --> 23:50.229
[laughter]
‐ Oh, yeah!

23:50.262 --> 23:52.898
‐ And her fondue pot.
‐ Her fondue pot!

23:52.932 --> 23:56.068
‐ Dad will eat anything
dipped in fondue.

23:56.101 --> 23:58.704
‐ And you forgot all
of our skis too.

24:00.940 --> 24:03.309
‐ $10,000.

24:03.342 --> 24:05.911
‐ That's his retainer?
He must be good.

24:05.945 --> 24:07.246
‐ Well, Beverly Hills.

24:07.279 --> 24:08.747
You know they know
about divorce.

24:08.781 --> 24:10.549
‐ I can't believe you had
to go all the way to L. A.

24:10.582 --> 24:12.251
to get a lawyer.
‐ All the way to L. A.

24:12.284 --> 24:14.586
to have Dan refuse
to pay him!

24:15.821 --> 24:18.657
He did pay for me and the kids
to go to Colorado.

24:18.691 --> 24:20.759
‐ Is that where you were?
Nice!

24:20.793 --> 24:22.094
‐ Why did he do that?

24:22.127 --> 24:24.063
‐ He felt bad.
He was ashamed.

24:24.096 --> 24:25.764
‐ Well, he should be.

24:25.798 --> 24:28.400
‐ I think he's having second
thoughts about the divorce.

24:28.434 --> 24:29.868
He says I have to get
a lawyer,

24:29.902 --> 24:31.603
but then he makes it impossible
to find one,

24:31.637 --> 24:33.339
and then he won't pay
the one I find

24:33.372 --> 24:35.941
even though he knows he'll be
reimbursed by the court.

24:35.975 --> 24:37.443
‐ He put you
in a mental hospital.

24:37.476 --> 24:39.478
‐ He was angry,
and I was angry.

24:39.511 --> 24:41.246
I mean,
he knows he overreacted.

24:41.280 --> 24:42.948
‐ He said that?
‐ No, he's Dan.

24:42.982 --> 24:44.283
He's not gonna admit
he was wrong,

24:44.316 --> 24:46.452
but he‐‐he sent us to
Keystone.

24:46.485 --> 24:48.687
‐ Well, I don't know
if that's exactly‐‐

24:48.721 --> 24:49.755
‐ Look at these two.

24:49.788 --> 24:53.258
You got separated and now
you're back together.

24:53.292 --> 24:55.294
‐ Yeah, we did,
but neither one of us

24:55.327 --> 24:56.862
ever actually hired a lawyer.

24:56.895 --> 24:58.263
‐ What about the Kanins?

24:58.297 --> 25:00.265
Dana took the kids
to her parents

25:00.299 --> 25:02.935
while Paul moved out,
now look at them.

25:02.968 --> 25:04.303
They're back together.

25:04.336 --> 25:05.704
‐ No one is saying
it can't happen.

25:05.738 --> 25:10.476
Just,
while Dan makes up his mind,

25:10.509 --> 25:11.710
you have to think
about yourself.

25:11.744 --> 25:13.946
‐ Look, if he's really
on the fence,

25:13.979 --> 25:16.281
then show him
what he's losing.

25:16.315 --> 25:18.384
Show him what a life
without you looks like.

25:18.417 --> 25:21.120
‐ New interests, new people.

25:21.153 --> 25:22.054
‐ A job.

25:22.087 --> 25:23.956
Money you don't have
to beg him for.

25:23.989 --> 25:25.290
‐ Have some fun.
‐ Be classy.

25:25.324 --> 25:26.291
‐ Loosen up!
‐ Go back to school.

25:26.325 --> 25:28.360
‐ Reinvent yourself,
become a brunette.

25:28.394 --> 25:30.029
Go blonder!
‐ Learn how to budget.

25:30.062 --> 25:31.830
‐ Become a completely
different person.

25:31.864 --> 25:34.500
Oh, and what about jogging?
Should we all do that?

25:34.533 --> 25:36.502
Should we jog?
[laughter]

25:36.535 --> 25:40.472
‐ I'm sorry, but there is
a whole big world out there.

25:40.506 --> 25:42.474
That is all we're saying.

25:42.508 --> 25:44.676
You don't have to be unhappy
if you don't want to be.

25:44.710 --> 25:47.246
‐ We want the old happy
Betty back.

25:47.279 --> 25:49.314
We love her.

25:49.348 --> 25:51.150
‐ [chuckles]

25:51.183 --> 25:54.486
Thank you for loving her.

25:54.520 --> 25:57.523
I used to work all the time
when you were little.

25:57.556 --> 25:59.258
Before we had anything,

25:59.291 --> 26:03.262
I was a babysitter,
a salesgirl,

26:03.295 --> 26:05.531
I was a waitress,
and a teacher.

26:05.564 --> 26:07.166
‐ Can I have one of these?

26:07.199 --> 26:09.668
‐ Those are for after dinner.

26:09.701 --> 26:10.636
Yes.

26:10.669 --> 26:12.771
‐ So what kind of job
are you gonna get?

26:12.805 --> 26:13.906
‐ I don't know.

26:13.939 --> 26:16.742
Something where I could
talk to people would be fun.

26:16.775 --> 26:18.343
What do you guys think
I should do?

26:18.377 --> 26:20.546
‐ Teach my class.
‐ I would love that.

26:20.579 --> 26:22.181
‐ Or you could do parties.

26:22.214 --> 26:26.218
Your parties are the most
fun ones out of everybody's.

26:26.251 --> 26:27.953
Can I have a Pudding Pop too?

26:27.986 --> 26:30.756
‐ Okay.
‐ Let's go.

26:31.557 --> 26:33.392
‐ Wait up!

26:35.627 --> 26:37.930
‐ "Dear Bets,
I wanted to let you know

26:37.963 --> 26:40.232
"in advance of the hearing
on the 16th

26:40.265 --> 26:43.202
"that my intention is to go
for a bifurcated divorce.

26:43.235 --> 26:46.138

to the property disposition,

and work out the property
settlement later.

27:15.968 --> 27:17.669

When?

27:17.703 --> 27:19.605
‐ Well, I don't know,
but that's what it means.

27:19.638 --> 27:23.442
Now Betty, I have left you
at least seven messages

27:23.475 --> 27:25.777
over this past week.
I even called Dan's lawyer

27:25.811 --> 27:27.779
to see if he knew what
was happening with you.

27:27.813 --> 27:31.450
I didn't expect him to call me
back, but neither did you.

27:31.483 --> 27:32.818
Not even once.

27:32.851 --> 27:34.786
‐ I mean, I'm sorry
about that, but I‐‐

27:34.820 --> 27:37.089
‐ I even thought about flying
down there, but you know what?

27:37.122 --> 27:39.625
I don't think you actually want
me to represent you, Betty.

27:39.658 --> 27:41.460
In fact, I don't think
you want a lawyer at all.

27:41.493 --> 27:42.961
‐ [chuckles]

27:42.995 --> 27:44.463
I don't want a divorce,

27:44.496 --> 27:46.265
so of course
I don't want a lawyer.

27:46.298 --> 27:48.967
‐ As of now, I am no longer
your attorney of record.

27:49.001 --> 27:51.637
My retainer hasn't been paid
by either Dan or you,

27:51.670 --> 27:54.039
but more than that,
I can't help someone

27:54.072 --> 27:57.342
who won't listen to me
or can't.

27:59.044 --> 28:00.846
‐ Thank you very much
for all of your help.

28:00.879 --> 28:04.049
I know you think
if you don't play,

28:04.082 --> 28:06.451
you can't lose, Betty,

28:06.485 --> 28:08.654

Why isn't he representing you?

29:24.997 --> 29:26.765
‐ He quit.

29:28.166 --> 29:29.301

jewelry store used to be?
