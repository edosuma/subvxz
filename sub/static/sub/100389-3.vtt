Are those protein balls?
Can I have one?

07:21.839 --> 07:24.172
No, absolutely not.
I need them for my show.

07:24.255 --> 07:25.506

-Yes!

07:25.589 --> 07:29.297
I would like to go over
the rescue mission,

07:29.381 --> 07:33.547
how we're gonna get every one
of the 5,000 souls off the ship.

07:33.631 --> 07:37.005
So, imagine that
this protein ball is Earth,

07:37.089 --> 07:39.756
and this protein ball
is a rescue shuttle.

07:39.839 --> 07:42.047
So then, Earth
and the rescue shuttle

07:42.130 --> 07:43.297

07:49.798 --> 07:51.172
Hey, brains trust. Use your mind

it's another thing.

07:53.798 --> 07:56.297
See? She can do it.
Hey, welcome back, Iris.

07:56.381 --> 08:01.464
We are gonna circle round
like this. Hold Earth.

08:01.547 --> 08:03.923
And then, we're gonna
come around closer,

08:04.005 --> 08:07.214
and then, eventually,
brush against Earth. Correct?

08:07.297 --> 08:09.923
Well, we'll be half a million
kilometers away.

08:10.005 --> 08:13.255
Yes, so close and yet,
absolutely nowhere near.

08:13.339 --> 08:15.464
Close enough
for a space shuttle.

08:15.547 --> 08:17.964
But... science!

08:18.047 --> 08:20.714
We're only gonna be this close
to Earth

08:20.798 --> 08:22.506

08:22.589 --> 08:24.255
Forty-eight hours

08:25.547 --> 08:28.589
(YELLING) Goddamnit Iris!
Stop being so negative!

08:28.673 --> 08:30.172
(YELLING) Technically,
that was just the truth!

08:30.255 --> 08:32.464
(SUBDUED) But yes, you did
sort of say it in a minor key.

08:32.547 --> 08:35.506
Now, each rescue shuttle
can only hold ten people,

08:35.589 --> 08:38.881
so... we're gonna need
more than one shuttle.

08:38.964 --> 08:40.464
-Because there are actually...
-JUDD: Actually--

08:40.547 --> 08:41.756
...more than ten passengers

08:41.839 --> 08:43.005
-onboard this ship.
-JUDD: Onboard--

08:43.089 --> 08:45.673
T-minus, that's exactly
what I'm talking about.

08:45.756 --> 08:47.756
T-minus? What is that,
your rap name?

08:47.839 --> 08:49.923
Is this what depression
looks like, Iris?

08:50.005 --> 08:52.547
'Cause if so, get that stuff
away from me.

08:52.631 --> 08:55.297
But also, uh,
get me 500 rescue shuttles.

08:55.381 --> 08:59.047
I don't know about y'all,
but I am feeling jazzed.

08:59.130 --> 09:01.005
Teamwork is fun.

09:01.089 --> 09:02.798
SUSAN: If he wants 500 ships,

09:02.881 --> 09:04.798
he needs to change
his attitude.

09:04.881 --> 09:06.839
I have a thick skin, Rav.

09:06.923 --> 09:09.089
I mean,
I fought in the Huawei Wars,

09:09.172 --> 09:11.923
but that man, I'm telling you,
he is one seriously...

09:12.005 --> 09:14.005
-Is that here? Is that outside?
-That's the vigil.

09:14.089 --> 09:15.673
It's Earth-based families
of the passengers.

09:15.756 --> 09:18.047
That's us, is it?
That's our tiny vigil? I--

09:18.130 --> 09:20.589
Yeah.
Also, there's been a surge in--

09:20.673 --> 09:22.130
don't worry about it.
It's not your area.

09:22.214 --> 09:24.047
If it's on Avenue 5,
it is my area.

09:24.130 --> 09:25.923
Susan, I happen to know
that Mr. Judd

09:26.005 --> 09:27.547
respects you vehemently.

09:27.631 --> 09:28.714
Alan, what's my area?

09:28.798 --> 09:30.547
There's been a surge
in complaints about towels.

09:30.631 --> 09:32.089
Some are just dirty,
others are being fashioned

09:32.172 --> 09:35.381
into obscene parts
of the human anatomy.

09:35.464 --> 09:37.214
-That's not my area.
-Yeah, I thought not.

09:37.297 --> 09:39.381
Towels? On behalf of NASA,

09:39.464 --> 09:42.214
let me say, "Seriously?"
(LAUGHS)

09:42.297 --> 09:45.422
Okay, I should go.
Bye-bye for now, Susan.

09:45.506 --> 09:47.005
Susan's fucking funny,
isn't she?

09:47.089 --> 09:48.756
Isn't Susan fucking funny?

09:48.839 --> 09:51.506
So, what we're gonna do
is you're gonna let out

09:51.589 --> 09:53.631
all this toxicity
between you two.

09:53.714 --> 09:57.339
Then, we're gonna trap it
in here, and then let it go.

09:57.422 --> 09:59.673
Like a beautiful
poison butterfly.

10:00.506 --> 10:02.839
Okay. Who goes first?

10:02.923 --> 10:05.005
-I'll go. (CLEARS THROAT)
-Oh, sure. Okay.

10:05.756 --> 10:09.547
Oh, lord! Am I married to this?

10:09.631 --> 10:12.631
Stan, baby, you look amazing.
I love those glasses.

10:12.714 --> 10:14.422
You look very clever.

10:14.506 --> 10:17.631
When I put mine on,
I just look like a welder.

10:17.714 --> 10:19.005
Oh, hi, Ryan.

10:20.005 --> 10:23.673
Hey, Rav. I am feeling
really undervalued

10:23.756 --> 10:26.756
by your decision
to imprison me in space.

10:26.839 --> 10:28.714
Rav had no clue
this was gonna happen.

10:28.798 --> 10:31.047
Uh, it's her job,
so she should have had a clue.

10:31.130 --> 10:32.464
DOUG:
Jeez, give her some time.

10:32.547 --> 10:33.464
(LAUGHTER)

10:33.547 --> 10:35.255
So, I look him in the eye,
best I can.

10:35.339 --> 10:37.130
You know, given the...
and I say,

10:37.214 --> 10:38.923
"You'll never get me
inside that helmet."

10:39.005 --> 10:40.547
(AUDIENCE GASPING)

10:43.089 --> 10:44.547
Ah.

10:44.631 --> 10:46.214
Just wait for that one to go.

10:48.339 --> 10:51.130
I have exciting news.

10:51.214 --> 10:52.798
You know I told you that
it was gonna be--

10:52.881 --> 10:55.923
it was gonna be three years.
It's not. It's six months.

10:56.005 --> 10:57.255
Are you drinking again?

10:57.339 --> 10:59.881
No, this is tomato juice.

10:59.964 --> 11:03.089
It's mostly tomato juice.
It's dynamite for the prostate.

11:03.172 --> 11:04.506
Anyway, you should be hearing--

11:04.589 --> 11:05.881
RYAN: (DELAYED) It's six months.

11:05.964 --> 11:08.005
-Wait, six months?
-There we go.

11:08.089 --> 11:11.089
I only have a couple more years
before everything falls apart...

11:11.172 --> 11:12.964
-MATT: Good.
-...and I'm stuck here with you.

11:13.047 --> 11:15.005
-Your biological clock
is ticking.
-MIA: Yes!

11:15.089 --> 11:16.798
-She's a little self-absorbed
for kids.
-MATT: Good!

11:16.881 --> 11:20.172
-Oh, oh, oh, and yet, I am stuck
with a 36-year-old one.
-Good.

11:20.255 --> 11:22.839
One who could get himself
adopted anytime.

11:22.923 --> 11:26.172
Six months is still too long.
Eight weeks was too long.

11:26.255 --> 11:29.172
Oh, for fuck's sake, Stan.
It's basic physics.

11:29.255 --> 11:31.923
You've worn the same pair
of jeans for longer than that.

11:39.089 --> 11:41.673
Shoehorns.
Pretty funny, aren't they?

11:41.756 --> 11:44.089
She doesn't think they are.
Um...

11:44.172 --> 11:46.839
-CRIS: Oh! There he is.
-There she is!

11:46.923 --> 11:48.506
Oh, Stan, our husband's
in space.

11:48.589 --> 11:49.673
(STAN CHUCKLES)

11:49.756 --> 11:53.255
-You two look so amazing.
-CRIS: You're drinking.

11:53.339 --> 11:55.214
Yeah, he just said
that he's got a bad prostate,

11:55.297 --> 11:56.964
and he's self-medicating
with vodka.

11:57.047 --> 11:59.381
-He also said that
it's gonna be six months.
-Not quite what I said, Stan,

11:59.464 --> 12:00.589
-is it?
-CRIS: Six months?

12:00.673 --> 12:03.673
Your marriage is like
the fucking Hindenburg, Rav!

12:03.756 --> 12:05.089
Just a flaming dirigible

12:05.172 --> 12:07.506
with dead Nazis falling out
of the bottom.

12:07.589 --> 12:10.005
(CRYING)

12:10.089 --> 12:11.464
RYAN: Oh, for fuck's sake,

12:11.547 --> 12:13.130
-Stan. It's basic physics.
-BOTH: Oh!

12:13.214 --> 12:14.547
I do understand the physics,
Ryan.

12:14.631 --> 12:15.589
Maybe I'd change my jeans

12:15.673 --> 12:16.839
if you were here
to do the washing.

12:16.923 --> 12:17.923
Have you finished?

12:18.005 --> 12:19.547
CRIS: This has to be
the last trip, Ryan.

12:19.631 --> 12:21.381
RYAN: Let's not do
the eight-week thing again.

12:21.464 --> 12:23.047
You don't mind the money,
let's be honest.

12:23.130 --> 12:24.881
They're miserable.
Everyone hates them.

12:24.964 --> 12:27.172
They wish
they'd never been born.

12:27.255 --> 12:29.172
(SOBBING)
I can't do this anymore!

12:29.255 --> 12:30.881
MATT: (HYSTERICAL)
What are you gonna do now, Rav?

12:30.964 --> 12:32.756
How are you gonna fix this now?

12:34.130 --> 12:36.506
-(PDA BEEPING)
-Now send.

12:36.589 --> 12:37.756
What?

12:37.839 --> 12:39.297
MATT: And that's it, sent.
All good.

12:39.381 --> 12:41.381
What are you--
What, you sent that to Rav?

12:42.089 --> 12:43.547
Ah, I gotta go.

12:43.631 --> 12:45.839
They found a rat
in the clementines.

12:47.172 --> 12:48.881
-(SIGHS)
-Hey, Martina, the rat's back.

12:51.047 --> 12:52.714
IRIS: We need more money
than there is money--

12:52.798 --> 12:54.047
-How many times--
-Twenty-seven.

12:54.130 --> 12:56.172
How many times have you said
that and I got the money?

12:56.255 --> 12:58.464
Twenty-seven.
But this is the first time

12:58.547 --> 13:00.756
five thousand human lives
have been on the line.

13:00.839 --> 13:03.172
I think. Wait.
No, yeah, it is.

13:03.255 --> 13:06.172
We need people to care.
We need a vigil.

13:07.172 --> 13:08.673
Th-- There is a vigil.

13:09.839 --> 13:13.464
Oh. Ah, that is sad.
For the wrong reason.

13:14.673 --> 13:16.255
Remember that vigil
for the children who died

13:16.339 --> 13:18.631
in the French famine.
Uh... La Famine?

13:18.714 --> 13:19.798
Très  tragic.

13:19.881 --> 13:21.798
We need to shit on that vigil.
How do we do that?

13:21.881 --> 13:23.005
I don't know. How do we do that?

13:23.089 --> 13:25.172
No, I'm asking you, Iris.
How do we do that?

13:26.297 --> 13:27.631
Actors.

13:27.714 --> 13:29.422
To play real people.

13:29.506 --> 13:31.297
Oh, but that would be very...

13:31.381 --> 13:33.214
-dishonest.
-Mm.

13:33.297 --> 13:36.297
-Unless it worked.
-I'll hire the actors now.

13:36.381 --> 13:38.464
They gotta be sad looking
and non-union.

13:38.547 --> 13:40.255
One thing usually means
the other.

13:50.673 --> 13:52.047
RYAN: (AMERICAN ACCENT)
There she is.

13:52.130 --> 13:53.172
(CHUCKLING) Oh, boy.

13:53.255 --> 13:56.255
RYAN: I was expecting you
about half a bottle ago.

13:56.339 --> 13:58.964
This isn't a cabin,
it's a basketball court.

13:59.047 --> 14:00.047
Mind if I, uh...

14:00.130 --> 14:02.172
-No, you can help yourself.
-KAREN: Wow.

14:02.255 --> 14:04.964
Oh, this is how
the other half lives.

14:05.047 --> 14:07.964
And dies. This room
belonged to dead Mary.

14:08.047 --> 14:09.255
-Oh.
-She's gonna be coming around

14:09.339 --> 14:10.464
in about 25 minutes.

14:10.547 --> 14:13.506
Yeah, this is our, uh,
Executive Stargazer Suite.

14:13.589 --> 14:15.089
Beautiful.

14:15.172 --> 14:18.339
Curious. This... This is just
a little porny.

14:18.422 --> 14:19.714
Well, we could get rid of that,

14:19.798 --> 14:21.673
you know,
if you were to move in.

14:21.756 --> 14:24.547
This is an accommodation fitting

14:24.631 --> 14:27.214
for the Passenger
Liaison Officer.

14:27.297 --> 14:30.839
Okay. I mean, that sounds
a little like salty talk.

14:30.923 --> 14:33.172
No, I just mean
you speak passenger.

14:33.255 --> 14:34.923
I mean,
you solve their problems,

14:35.005 --> 14:36.506
whereas Matt just...

14:36.589 --> 14:38.464
turns them into balloon animals.

14:38.547 --> 14:40.631
I think we should formalize
that role.

14:41.381 --> 14:42.881
Oh. Okay.

14:42.964 --> 14:45.631
You would be
Passenger Liaison Officer.

14:45.714 --> 14:47.673
-KAREN: It's interesting.
-RYAN: Fantastic.

14:47.756 --> 14:49.422
KAREN:
You want me to come over there?

14:49.506 --> 14:53.547
Yeah. This is a, uh,
2024 Pinot Meunier.

14:53.631 --> 14:56.172
-Excellent year.
-Hottest year on record.

14:56.255 --> 14:58.381
The fish in our pond
boiled to death.

14:58.464 --> 15:01.506
Let's drink to the fish.
Let's drink like fish.

15:01.589 --> 15:03.464
Let's just drink.

15:03.547 --> 15:05.464
Okay, look,
I should make it clear

15:05.547 --> 15:08.923
that coitus is not on the menu.

15:09.005 --> 15:12.506
That's a very odd menu,
but sure, absolutely.

15:14.047 --> 15:15.130
KAREN: Great.

15:17.130 --> 15:18.631
(ENGLISH ACCENT)
Tickle my ring piece,

15:18.714 --> 15:21.881
that is absolutely exquisite.

15:21.964 --> 15:24.089
-(CHUCKLING) What is that?
-What's what?

15:24.172 --> 15:26.923
Does drinking champagne
turn you British?

15:27.005 --> 15:29.506
What you mean? You--
But you know.

15:29.589 --> 15:31.673
I mean, you knew, didn't you?

15:32.673 --> 15:33.881
What? You are British?

15:33.964 --> 15:36.255
You're from actual Britland?

15:36.339 --> 15:38.005
Oh! No.

15:39.172 --> 15:41.339
I get so confused.
I'm sorry.

15:41.422 --> 15:44.130
I just get-- I'm sorry.
I really am sorry.

15:44.214 --> 15:46.923
Whoa. That's three sorries.
You really are British.

15:47.005 --> 15:49.255
I'm pretending to be American
to one lot of people.

15:49.339 --> 15:52.089
I'm pretending to be a captain
to another lot of people.

15:52.172 --> 15:54.756
-I'm pretending to care--
-What? Sorry, what?

15:54.839 --> 15:56.673
Shit, I've done it again,
haven't I?

15:56.756 --> 15:59.089
Done what-- what have you done?
I don't really--

15:59.172 --> 16:01.339
-Nothing.
-Okay.

16:01.422 --> 16:03.839
You said pretending
to be captain?

16:03.923 --> 16:04.881
Yeah.

16:04.964 --> 16:07.005
Okay, where is the real captain?

16:08.130 --> 16:09.214
He's... out there.

16:09.297 --> 16:12.089
-About ten minutes behind Mary.
-No, no, no. No. No.

16:12.172 --> 16:13.673
-I mean, yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Uh-uh. No.

16:13.756 --> 16:14.839
That's not happening.

16:14.923 --> 16:16.297
-Not funny. Not funny.
-Karen. This is-- Listen.

16:16.381 --> 16:17.714
You know what?
You need to shut up!

16:17.798 --> 16:18.881
Okay. Shutting up.

16:19.673 --> 16:21.589
Oh, no. This is so-- You--

16:21.673 --> 16:23.964
We're--
And you're a lying D-head!

16:24.047 --> 16:27.923
I was hired to be like
a ceremonial captain. Okay?

16:28.005 --> 16:30.756
What? What does that mean?
So you're an actor. Yeah?

16:30.839 --> 16:33.297
Oh, okay. Right,
in the last ten seconds,

16:33.381 --> 16:35.714
you just changed continents
and careers.

16:35.798 --> 16:37.798
No, actually, my first career
was in the wine trade.

16:37.881 --> 16:40.339
So, we're just up here
in this giant tin can

16:40.422 --> 16:42.089
with a boozehound driving!

16:42.172 --> 16:43.756
To be fair, most actors
are boozehounds.

16:43.839 --> 16:45.089
Oh, big fat Buddha.

16:45.172 --> 16:47.464
I am hyper-effing-ventilating
here.

16:47.547 --> 16:48.964
-(SIGHS)
-What are you doing now?

16:49.047 --> 16:51.881
I need to invert
because I do not wanna pass out

16:51.964 --> 16:57.089
before I finish yelling at you,
you mother-effing C-sucker!

16:57.172 --> 16:58.714
When other people find out
about this...

16:58.798 --> 17:00.589
No, they're not going--
Oh, "cock." Got it.

17:00.673 --> 17:02.547
They're not going to find out.
That's the whole point.

17:02.631 --> 17:03.839
-That's--
-Okay, yeah.

17:03.923 --> 17:06.964
Because your head is gonna be
on a spike in the Atrium.

17:07.047 --> 17:08.798
Oh, wind your neck in, will you?

17:08.881 --> 17:11.506
Look, who do you think
people want to see in charge?

17:11.589 --> 17:13.130
They wanna see a captain
or a vintner?

17:13.214 --> 17:14.881
I think a captain, don't you?

17:14.964 --> 17:18.673
The point is, we are trapped
here on a branded dildo

17:18.756 --> 17:20.798
hurtling through space,
full of panicky animals

17:20.881 --> 17:22.839
who are gonna start painting
the wall with their turds

17:22.923 --> 17:26.964
and eating each other's feet
unless I show leadership,

17:27.047 --> 17:29.130
and I need you
to help me do that.

17:31.130 --> 17:32.464
Give me one of those.

17:34.923 --> 17:37.589
Okay. I also get this cabin,
right?

17:37.673 --> 17:38.881
The cab-- Oh, absolutely.

17:38.964 --> 17:41.214
I was actually-- I was gonna
give you a--

17:41.297 --> 17:43.214
an envelope
with a mini bar key in it.

17:43.297 --> 17:47.464
I was-- which is by the way,
not so mini. (CHUCKLES)

Are you enjoying this, Rav?

18:01.923 --> 18:03.839
Two words. Worm holes.

18:03.923 --> 18:05.631
If they exist,
they can be created.

18:05.714 --> 18:08.255
I miss drizzle.
I miss dogs barking.

18:08.339 --> 18:10.881
I miss toilet paper
without a J on it.

18:11.005 --> 18:13.255
Yeah, I can get myself adopted
anytime!

18:13.339 --> 18:16.881
(SOBBING)
I can't do this anymore!

18:17.589 --> 18:19.839
I can't do this anymo--

18:23.005 --> 18:26.214
Chief Passenger Liaison Officer
on duty.

18:29.839 --> 18:32.506
So. Screwing the stowaway now,
huh?

18:32.589 --> 18:35.005
-No, I am not. Not-- What?
-(PURRING)

18:35.089 --> 18:36.381
-What is that? I--
-(JUDD CHUCKLES)

18:36.464 --> 18:38.839
No, Karen is helping
with passenger services.

18:38.923 --> 18:40.005
Right. "Karen."

18:40.089 --> 18:41.714
I bet you're feeling
pretty pleased with yourself.

18:41.798 --> 18:43.839
-No. I'm not.
-Well, you shouldn't.

18:43.923 --> 18:45.381
'Cause I've never seen
that woman happy.

18:45.464 --> 18:46.923
Well, that has nothing to do
with me.

18:47.005 --> 18:50.214
(CHUCKLING) Yeah, I believe you,
Mr. Bad in Bed.

18:51.673 --> 18:53.798
Well, I really enjoyed
this little talk,

18:53.881 --> 18:55.089
but I'm off to the bridge now.

18:55.172 --> 18:57.631
Ooh, when the bridge
comes a-rockin',

18:57.714 --> 18:59.089
don't come a-knockin'.

18:59.172 --> 19:02.047
See you and the little fuckatee
later. (CHUCKLING)

Hey, Cyrus.

19:04.714 --> 19:07.589
My knight in shining shorts.
What do you got?

19:07.673 --> 19:09.881
You're gonna love this.
Uh, slight snag.

19:09.964 --> 19:13.798
I didn't factor in
the ship's extra weight.

19:13.881 --> 19:16.464
Those 500 extra lottery winners.

19:16.547 --> 19:17.881
You're gonna number-fuck us,
aren't you?

19:17.964 --> 19:19.214
RYAN: You didn't factor...

19:19.297 --> 19:21.172
meaning you didn't count.
Just to be clear.

19:21.255 --> 19:25.297
Right. Yeah. So, my numbers
are actually adding  six months.

19:25.381 --> 19:27.255
Six months more
than the six months

19:27.339 --> 19:28.381
that you estimate.

19:28.464 --> 19:30.798
Six months in addition
to the three years.

19:30.881 --> 19:33.756
Um, you're saying the voyage
is now gonna take

19:33.839 --> 19:37.422
three and a half years,
just so we're appallingly clear.

19:37.506 --> 19:38.673
-Yep.
-RYAN: "Yep"?

19:38.756 --> 19:41.464
You can't say "yep."
This isn't a time for "yep."

19:41.547 --> 19:43.339
Uh, "yes." Affirmative.

19:43.422 --> 19:45.839
Cyrus, you're like Santa Claus
with a sack full of shit.

19:45.923 --> 19:48.673
Do you have any options
that you can suggest?

19:48.756 --> 19:50.673
Well, there's the one.

19:50.756 --> 19:51.923
You know what I'm talking about.

19:52.005 --> 19:53.172
I know you know
what I'm talking about.

19:53.255 --> 19:55.839
No. I don't-- I'm not fluent
in facial expressions.

19:55.923 --> 19:57.714
-You should try words.
-Okay, okay.

20:00.255 --> 20:01.923
It could be shorter...

20:02.964 --> 20:07.130
if we lose
those extra 500 people.

20:08.506 --> 20:09.714
Lose?

20:09.798 --> 20:13.130
They're not a set of keys,
you fucking psychopath.

20:14.964 --> 20:17.172
Oh, Captain,
we have a laundry issue.

with such epaulettes,

20:20.381 --> 20:21.714
you look remarkably rattled.

20:21.798 --> 20:24.047
Well, now, Karen.
Today may be the day

20:24.130 --> 20:27.381

I don't like the way

Is it a big number?

20:32.631 --> 20:34.047

-Mm-mm.

No. F me. F me with a... CB.

-No, hours.

Are we gonna do this
every time?

20:42.422 --> 20:44.297
-Yes! Three and a half years!
-Okay.

20:45.214 --> 20:46.464
When are you gonna tell them?

20:46.547 --> 20:48.589
I'm not. That's the point,
Karen. You're gonna tell them.

20:48.673 --> 20:50.506
You're gonna do the telling
and the selling.

20:50.589 --> 20:53.506
And what the fuck is a CB?

20:53.589 --> 20:56.089
Oh, um, uh, cheese baguette.

20:56.172 --> 20:59.339
Okay. Well, this is classic
passenger liaison, Karen.

20:59.422 --> 21:01.631
You've gotta go out there,
and you've gotta liaise them

21:01.714 --> 21:04.130

27:11.172 --> 27:13.631
it's just that Judd wanted
hot crew,

27:13.714 --> 27:16.964
and there's just no intersection
in that Venn diagram.

27:17.047 --> 27:18.673
Yeah, just you and me, Billie.

27:18.756 --> 27:20.255
Another miscalculation.

27:20.339 --> 27:21.589
Does Judd know about this?

27:21.673 --> 27:23.923
Does he strike you
as a details kind of guy?

27:25.255 --> 27:26.964
Okay, he can never know.

27:27.047 --> 27:28.839
He cannot know.
Everybody get that?

27:28.923 --> 27:32.923
Judd must operate
on a never-need-to-know basis.

27:33.005 --> 27:33.964
Okay?

27:34.047 --> 27:35.798
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Passengers on the bridge.

27:35.881 --> 27:37.381
(AMERICAN ACCENT)
Welcome to the bridge.

27:40.881 --> 27:43.881
(SIGHS) It's gonna be fine.
It's all gonna be fine.

27:46.464 --> 27:48.255
Our course home has been set.

27:49.214 --> 27:51.047
There's a lot of people
counting on us

27:51.130 --> 27:52.255
to get them there.

27:53.297 --> 27:55.130
Sarah, lights.

28:03.381 --> 28:04.839
(ENGLISH ACCENT)
Are they still fucking there?

28:04.923 --> 28:05.964
BILLIE: Yep.
