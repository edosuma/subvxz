02:24.412 --> 02:25.489
Sofia?

02:25.513 --> 02:27.915
Sofia.

02:30.384 --> 02:32.429
Are you...
Are you friends with Sofia?

02:32.453 --> 02:34.198
Sofia... no, no.

02:34.222 --> 02:35.765
No... no English.

02:39.260 --> 02:40.570
I don't... I don't understand.

02:42.963 --> 02:44.674
Uh, okay. All right.

03:11.225 --> 03:13.761
Where are we going?

03:17.298 --> 03:21.778
Mabel. La Tía Mabel.

03:21.802 --> 03:25.482
What?
La Tía Mabel.

03:25.506 --> 03:27.341
Your bell?

03:29.377 --> 03:33.357
I don't... Uh, um...

03:33.381 --> 03:42.366
No habla español.

03:44.958 --> 03:47.371
It's hard to focus.
I'm so scared right now.

04:26.734 --> 04:30.103
Is this your buddy?
Is this your friend?

05:00.601 --> 05:02.879
Guess what.
You're not special.

05:02.903 --> 05:04.348
In the U.S. alone,

05:04.372 --> 05:06.516
there are 4.2 million
recreational artists,

05:06.540 --> 05:11.220
800,000 art students,
and 3 million professionals.

05:11.244 --> 05:15.224
That's 8 million people
infected with the disease

05:15.248 --> 05:19.219
that some optimistically call
"the creative type."

05:21.389 --> 05:23.199
They wake up every morning, and
when they look in the mirror,

05:23.223 --> 05:25.369
they feel special.

05:25.393 --> 05:28.204
They think they have
a story worth telling.

05:28.228 --> 05:31.174
Most of them go on and write,
paint, play, sing the story,

05:31.198 --> 05:33.410
and then they publish it
on endless blogs.

05:33.434 --> 05:36.346
The world tells them,
"Trust yourself,"

05:36.370 --> 05:38.582
and "You are different."

05:38.606 --> 05:40.584
But only 15% of them
will get a job

05:40.608 --> 05:42.386
that they feel worthy
of their talent.

05:42.410 --> 05:45.254
A mere 2% will achieve
any sort of visibility.

05:45.278 --> 05:48.057
And less than .2%
will get famous,

05:48.081 --> 05:51.495
only to be forgotten in
an average time of three years.

05:51.519 --> 05:53.697
Before traveling
to Argentina that winter,

05:53.721 --> 05:55.432
I was among these
8 million people.

05:55.456 --> 05:57.367
I met Sofia for the first time

05:57.391 --> 06:00.404
when she left a comment
on my most famous viral video...

06:00.428 --> 06:02.171
"Dancing Tomatoes."

06:02.195 --> 06:04.774
She wrote,
"Your work is so shallow,

06:04.798 --> 06:07.444
it's the perfect metaphor
for a decadent world."

06:07.468 --> 06:09.437
I was instantly
attracted to her.

06:15.242 --> 06:17.887
If he buys this,
we're finally set, Alex.

06:17.911 --> 06:20.356
No more of this
struggling artist bullshit.

06:20.380 --> 06:21.991
We need this, man.

06:22.015 --> 06:24.193
Alex, I need you to focus, okay?

06:24.217 --> 06:26.029
It's definitely
a big opportunity,

06:26.053 --> 06:28.565
but just pitch the show
with a lot of confidence

06:28.589 --> 06:30.834
and you'll be fine.
Say yes.

06:30.858 --> 06:32.669
Yes. Yes.
That's it.

06:32.693 --> 06:34.604
Come on.

06:34.628 --> 06:36.039
You just really need
to focus, that's all.

06:37.898 --> 06:40.076
Look, I brought the tomatoes
in case you want to use them.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.611
Here.

06:41.635 --> 06:45.214
You know, he might want
to see them or something.

06:45.238 --> 06:47.407
All right, man. Let's go.
Let's do this. Come on.

06:49.677 --> 06:51.755
Why are we doing this?
That's the main question, right?

06:51.779 --> 06:54.390
I want to respect
the artistic process.

06:54.414 --> 06:56.392
I want to do more than, like,
a funny video or, like,

06:56.416 --> 06:58.495
a dancing thing, you know?

06:58.519 --> 07:00.229
I know what I don't want to do.

07:00.253 --> 07:02.031
I have a long list
of things that I hate.

07:02.055 --> 07:03.900
It doesn't have to be
overly negative, of course.

07:03.924 --> 07:08.705
How many viewers does your
tomatoes video have up to now?

07:08.729 --> 07:10.440
Uh, it's like 2 million.

07:10.464 --> 07:11.741
But it's been online
for three years.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.677
And how much money
have you made?

07:13.701 --> 07:15.378
It's online.
Nada?

07:15.402 --> 07:16.946
Zip?
Zero?

07:16.970 --> 07:19.716
In the old days,
fame came with fortune.

07:19.740 --> 07:21.851
Internet fame costs you money.

07:21.875 --> 07:23.887
You're paying for
other people to enjoy.

07:23.911 --> 07:25.421
I'm glad you brought it up,

07:25.445 --> 07:26.823
'cause he and I
talk about this all the time.

07:26.847 --> 07:29.025
Do you know about
what our brand is?

07:29.049 --> 07:30.860
Energy Yogurt...
I assume it's yogurt.

07:30.884 --> 07:32.395
Yeah.

07:32.419 --> 07:34.931
We're gonna sign a contract,
you and me.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.866
I can get it ready for you
in a couple of weeks.

07:36.890 --> 07:38.367
The point is,
is that you're gonna have

07:38.391 --> 07:40.537
complete artistic freedom, okay?

07:40.561 --> 07:42.606
The only thing we're gonna do
is we're gonna change out

07:42.630 --> 07:45.709
the tomatoes for strawberries,
bananas, and kiwis

07:45.733 --> 07:46.943
just to get a range.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.578
I Fe...

07:48.602 --> 07:50.379
I feel like we're talking
about two different things here.

07:50.403 --> 07:52.381
Uh, well, let's be
honest here, Patrick.

07:52.405 --> 07:54.183
Alex.
Yeah, whatever.

07:54.207 --> 07:57.521
You can milk the tomatoes now
and get the money

07:57.545 --> 07:59.856
or you can watch
how people forget about it

07:59.880 --> 08:01.858
and go on
to the next stupid thing.

08:01.882 --> 08:04.060
Now, do you want
to put it to work for you

08:04.084 --> 08:07.497
or do you want
to let it go to waste?

08:48.762 --> 08:51.340
Yo!
Just a minute.

08:51.364 --> 08:53.342
Come on.
There's a fucking line.

09:12.686 --> 09:16.165
Hey!
Tomato guy, whoo!

09:48.021 --> 09:51.367
This is an automated security
alert from East Borough Bank.

09:51.391 --> 09:53.837
A purchase superior to $1,000

09:53.861 --> 09:55.672
has been charged
to your credit card...

09:55.696 --> 09:57.573
Oh, no.

09:57.597 --> 10:02.111
An American Airlines ticket
to Buenos Aires, Argentina.

10:02.135 --> 10:04.047
If you did not make
this transaction,

10:04.071 --> 10:06.650
please contact us immediately.

10:06.674 --> 10:09.209
Have a great day.

10:15.515 --> 10:18.194
Hey. What's up?
You won't believe what happened.

10:18.218 --> 10:19.829
I've been invited
to talk about my work

10:19.853 --> 10:22.165
in Buenos Aires... tomorrow.

10:22.189 --> 10:23.867
I'd love to see you.

10:23.891 --> 10:26.293

to grab a coffee or something.

Hi, Sofia.

12:01.421 --> 12:02.899
I'm writing this e-mail
from the phone of a guy

12:02.923 --> 12:05.458
who offered his help.

12:07.560 --> 12:10.697
I just got all my stuff stolen
when I was looking for a hotel.

12:13.633 --> 12:16.345
I'll be sitting on the corner
of Humboldt and Paraguay.

12:16.369 --> 12:18.872
I have no money and no way
to get back to you.

12:20.874 --> 12:22.251
I know this is the last message

12:22.275 --> 12:24.077
you were expecting
to get from me.

12:28.515 --> 12:29.859
I promise it will be
the last one

12:29.883 --> 12:32.161
if you don't show up.

12:32.185 --> 12:33.362
I'll be waiting.

12:33.386 --> 12:35.722
Yours, Alex.

14:07.280 --> 14:10.426
Fundamental dynamics
of our eye contact.

14:10.450 --> 14:12.095
The dynamics of our eye contact

14:12.119 --> 14:15.398
started 8,000 years ago
in the interior of the sun.

14:15.422 --> 14:17.733
Millions of photons were trapped
in its core for centuries,

14:17.757 --> 14:20.836
and, much later, we were born
and everything else happened.

14:20.860 --> 14:22.671
Then in a solar storm
eight minutes

14:22.695 --> 14:24.540
before I saw her
for the first time

14:24.564 --> 14:26.109
that summer night,
some of those photons

14:26.133 --> 14:28.444
traveled 91.4 million miles
through space

14:28.468 --> 14:29.778
and bounced into the moon,

14:29.802 --> 14:32.248
reaching my pupils
1.3 seconds later.

14:32.272 --> 14:34.350
Only then, a portion
of those particles

14:34.374 --> 14:35.851
reflected back to Sofia.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.520
And so, we could look each other

14:37.544 --> 14:39.188
in the eyes for the first time.

14:39.212 --> 14:41.581
But the fact of the matter
is that I looked away.

14:43.550 --> 14:46.562
Hi.

14:46.586 --> 14:49.332
Hi.

14:49.356 --> 14:54.437
Are you okay?

14:54.461 --> 14:57.530
I'm okay.

15:01.234 --> 15:04.413
Eh, why would you call me
in a situation like this?

15:04.437 --> 15:06.182
What about the people
you came to see?

15:06.206 --> 15:09.252
I-I-I lost all my stuff.

15:09.276 --> 15:11.054
And I-I didn't have
anyone else's e-mail,

15:11.078 --> 15:12.521
so I'm sorry.
I'm not...

15:12.545 --> 15:16.759
Did he mention Mabel?
Mabel? What, uh...

15:16.783 --> 15:19.762
Did Victor ask you something
about my aunt Mabel?

15:19.786 --> 15:21.330
Yeah, Victor...
That's that guy?

15:21.354 --> 15:24.733
That's that... that...
Who is that guy?

15:24.757 --> 15:26.869
It's my boyfriend, okay?

15:26.893 --> 15:28.037
Listen...
Your boyfriend?

15:28.061 --> 15:29.538
Okay, what did you say?

15:29.562 --> 15:31.774
Well, I didn't...
I didn't know what to say.

15:31.798 --> 15:33.576
I thought he was talking
about a fucking bell.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.344
That... he... you...
You have a boyfriend?

15:35.368 --> 15:36.946
I can't believe
that you didn't tell me...

15:36.970 --> 15:38.714
Okay, lower your voice.
That you have a boyfriend.

15:38.738 --> 15:41.017
Shh. Lower your voice.

15:41.041 --> 15:44.053
Listen carefully. I don't know
you and you don't know me, okay?

15:44.077 --> 15:45.521
Clearly.

15:45.545 --> 15:46.755
Tomorrow, you will
make some phone calls

15:46.779 --> 15:50.159
and sleep somewhere else.

15:50.183 --> 15:54.097
What's that?

15:54.121 --> 15:55.564
It's my little bag of shit

15:55.588 --> 15:57.866
that they let me keep
for emotional value.

15:57.890 --> 15:59.102
I-I don't...
I-I-I can't believe

15:59.126 --> 16:00.569
that you lied to me...
I didn't.

16:00.593 --> 16:02.038
About having a boyfriend.
You didn't?

16:02.062 --> 16:03.506
I didn't lie.

16:03.530 --> 16:04.940
What are you talking about?
I didn't lie.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.275
This is my real life.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.111
It's not the Internet.
What?

16:08.135 --> 16:10.079
The Internet is real life.
We've been chatting for months.

16:10.103 --> 16:12.415
I sent you a picture
of my dick 24 hours ago.

16:12.439 --> 16:14.483
What do you expect
out of that picture?

16:14.507 --> 16:15.718
What did I expect?

16:15.742 --> 16:17.086
Five-star hotel
and a loving girlfriend?

16:17.110 --> 16:20.889
I was in a club
in a bathroom in a stall.

16:20.913 --> 16:23.359
And there was a dude
pounding on the door.

16:23.383 --> 16:25.228
Okay, listen.
Okay, yeah, I'm sorry.

16:25.252 --> 16:28.664
Listen. You are my cousin
that I've never seen before.

16:29.722 --> 16:32.868
Aunt Mabel's nephew. Okay?

16:32.892 --> 16:34.270
You can spend the night here

16:34.294 --> 16:39.042
as long as you
play along with this.

16:39.066 --> 16:41.377
Okay?
Okay.

16:41.401 --> 16:47.650
Okay, I have no, uh...
I have no other options, so...

16:47.674 --> 16:49.609
It will be fine.

17:02.122 --> 17:04.166
Hey. Alex?

17:04.191 --> 17:07.103
I'm Flor. Nice to meet you.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.073
Sofia told me about your loss.

17:10.097 --> 17:11.940
I'm so sorry.

17:11.964 --> 17:13.876
She told me
that you live in New York.

17:13.900 --> 17:16.712
I have never been there,
but it must be awesome.

17:16.736 --> 17:20.215
My loss?
Yeah, the robbery, Alex?

17:20.240 --> 17:22.942
Right.

17:27.714 --> 17:31.260
What time is it?
It's, um, 12:50.

17:31.284 --> 17:33.829
You know, I can tell the time
without looking.

17:33.853 --> 17:36.732
I can feel it, you know?
It just happens.

17:36.756 --> 17:39.868
Oh, Alex, if I say
your name a lot, like,

17:39.892 --> 17:42.895
it's just
a memory technique I use.

18:00.012 --> 18:01.514
No, gracias.

18:04.251 --> 18:06.085
What?

18:10.257 --> 18:12.268
Alex, could you move
a little bit?

18:12.292 --> 18:13.536
'Cause we need more room here.

18:13.560 --> 18:15.595
Yes, yes, yes.

18:19.199 --> 18:20.443
Alex, I'm so sorry.

18:20.467 --> 18:22.111
No, no, no.

18:22.135 --> 18:25.138
Alex, I'm sorry.
Go back to sleep.

18:32.212 --> 18:34.390
Alex, I'm sorry.
This is your house, too, okay?

18:34.414 --> 18:35.691
It's not my house.

18:35.715 --> 18:37.025
You can sleep
until the hour you want.

18:37.049 --> 18:38.694
I'm awake. I'm awake.
Come, please.

18:38.718 --> 18:41.521
No, no, no,
I'm not gonna go back to sleep.

18:48.361 --> 18:50.273
Oh. Oh.

18:50.297 --> 18:51.574
I'm sorry.

18:51.598 --> 18:53.176
Why are you sorry?
I-I'm very sorry.

18:53.200 --> 18:54.577
Because you were sleeping.

18:54.601 --> 18:56.035
I don't even know
where I am right now.

19:00.407 --> 19:02.275
She has reason.

19:12.685 --> 19:15.331
A fire.

19:15.355 --> 19:19.835
Fire? Were we starting a fire?
A fire, help.

19:19.859 --> 19:21.504
Help, you, eh?

19:21.528 --> 19:22.938
You here, okay?
You here, you help.

19:22.962 --> 19:25.541
Okay, Victor, okay.
Alex, please go with him.

19:25.565 --> 19:27.176
Go.
Just a minute.

19:27.200 --> 19:29.111
Gonna start a fire somewhere?
Eh, no, you just...

19:29.135 --> 19:31.347
Go. Okay? Go.

19:31.371 --> 19:33.940
Go, go.

19:42.715 --> 19:44.384
What?

19:56.429 --> 19:58.674
Listen, I'm from New Jersey.

19:58.698 --> 20:01.677
I have never done anything...
I have no idea what I'm doing.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.403
Okay? No idea.

20:38.905 --> 20:41.149
Um, Alex?

20:41.173 --> 20:44.577
Um, hola.
Could you come for a second?

20:47.780 --> 20:52.094
Um... I looked up
the U.S. Embassy number

20:52.118 --> 20:54.597
for you to report
your passport missing.

20:54.621 --> 20:57.766
Oh. Thank you.
No, you're welcome.

20:57.790 --> 21:00.769
You know, it's important
that we call now.

21:00.793 --> 21:03.606
Want me to call? You know,
they can steal your identity.

21:03.630 --> 21:05.173
You know that?
That that happens?

21:05.197 --> 21:06.275
Yeah, you know what,
I thought about that.

21:06.299 --> 21:08.176
I'll just do it,
but I don't think

21:08.200 --> 21:09.712
there's any, like,
tremendous rush.

21:09.736 --> 21:12.080
No, really, I read it,
and there was this guy

21:12.104 --> 21:13.582
that was raped in jail

21:13.606 --> 21:15.718
for a crime
that he didn't commit.

21:15.742 --> 21:17.686
Sure, but here's the thing.
What?

21:17.710 --> 21:22.858
Um, I saw with my own eyes
the guy...

21:22.882 --> 21:24.593
They were kids who robbed me.

21:24.617 --> 21:26.362
And I just don't... I think
they were interested in my cash.

21:26.386 --> 21:27.530
I don't think
they wanted my passport.

21:27.554 --> 21:28.897
You can never know. Really.

21:28.921 --> 21:31.023
I know you can never know...

21:44.303 --> 21:45.781
Thank you, Flor.

21:45.805 --> 21:47.550
You call from my phone,
of course.

21:47.574 --> 21:50.218
No, no. What we'll do
is we'll do it later, though.

21:50.242 --> 21:51.654
I don't...

21:55.915 --> 21:58.861
Yeah, I can't...
I can't hear anything.

21:58.885 --> 22:00.162
Let's just call later.

22:00.186 --> 22:02.230
Because it's tricky
to get reception.

22:02.254 --> 22:03.599
You see this bow?
Uh-huh.

22:03.623 --> 22:05.368
You get reception here.
Wait.

22:05.392 --> 22:07.169
Lost or stolen passports...

22:07.193 --> 22:08.937
Choose from the following
options.

22:08.961 --> 22:11.674
Please say "robbery"
if your passport was stolen.

22:11.698 --> 22:14.543
Or say "lost" if your passport
is just missing.

22:14.567 --> 22:17.045
Robbery.
You chose stolen passport.

22:17.069 --> 22:19.715
Please say "violent robbery"
if your life was in peril.

22:19.739 --> 22:22.385
Or say "non-violent"...
Non-violent.

22:22.409 --> 22:24.019
You chose non-violent.

22:24.043 --> 22:25.754
Please wait on the line.

22:25.778 --> 22:27.356
Please state your name
after the beep

22:27.380 --> 22:28.924
as a signature of your testimony

22:28.948 --> 22:31.159
and your passport
will be invalidated.

22:33.620 --> 22:35.431
Um...

22:35.455 --> 22:37.600
Uh, you know what?
I don't know which...

22:37.624 --> 22:39.201
'cause I have a hyphenated...
What do you mean?

22:39.225 --> 22:40.703
I don't, um...
Alex, say your name.

22:40.727 --> 22:42.337
Alex Taylor.

22:42.361 --> 22:44.673
Your former passport
is now invalidated.

22:44.697 --> 22:48.176
Please enter the contact
number in Buenos Aires.

22:51.604 --> 22:53.649
Thank you. You will be
contacted with the date

22:53.673 --> 22:55.518
and instructions
for your appointment.

22:55.542 --> 22:57.520
Have a nice day.
Okay.

22:57.544 --> 22:58.887
They'll call us
with appointment day.

22:58.911 --> 23:00.689
Oh, good. When?

23:00.713 --> 23:02.691
I don't know. They didn't say.

23:02.715 --> 23:05.093
So maybe I could just stay
with you for a couple days?

23:05.117 --> 23:06.895
Until...
Non-violent?

23:06.919 --> 23:08.531
From your e-mail, I thought

23:08.555 --> 23:10.433
they put a gun to your head
when they robbed you.

23:10.457 --> 23:12.868
Well, it was intimidating
on a conceptual level, I mean...

23:12.892 --> 23:14.503
Well, assuming violence

23:14.527 --> 23:16.371
just because you're
in South America is so racist.

23:16.395 --> 23:18.273
No, you know what?
It was violent.

23:18.297 --> 23:20.467
It was more violent
than I remembered it.

23:32.111 --> 23:33.746
What?

23:38.350 --> 23:41.697
You're staying.
I am? I am.

23:41.721 --> 23:44.256
Yes.

24:01.941 --> 24:03.519
What are you doing?

24:03.543 --> 24:09.424
Oh, um, well,
I have no summer clothes,

24:09.448 --> 24:12.928
so I'm improvising.

24:12.952 --> 24:14.997
Let me help you.

24:15.021 --> 24:17.524
Could you stand up?
Yeah.

24:21.393 --> 24:23.596
Thanks.
You're welcome.

24:26.132 --> 24:27.943
So are those
your paintings, too?

24:27.967 --> 24:31.213
Oh, yeah, well,
it's Victor's work.

24:31.237 --> 24:33.315
I'm his assistant.

24:33.339 --> 24:37.686
I help him mix the paint.

24:37.710 --> 24:39.555
You know, they're about
the human figure

24:39.579 --> 24:42.591
as a trigger
for, uh, pictorial dialogue.

24:42.615 --> 24:46.562
Sounds... sounds neat.
Sounds really neat.

24:46.586 --> 24:48.330
So let me... I'm just gonna...

24:48.354 --> 24:50.432
I mean, maybe it's just me,
I don't know.

24:50.456 --> 24:53.736
I just notice a real, uh...

24:53.760 --> 24:56.772
tension between Victor
and Sofia.

24:56.796 --> 25:00.576
Oh, yeah, we're all under
a lot of stress these days.

25:00.600 --> 25:02.711
We have a lot of work to finish.

25:02.735 --> 25:05.781
Two days to go, and then we are
out of here for two weeks.

25:05.805 --> 25:08.150
Victor's gonna be part
of a group exhibition

25:08.174 --> 25:10.710
and the winner
will get a grant for life.

25:12.679 --> 25:16.759
Word is Victor's gonna get it,
but he's nervous.

25:16.783 --> 25:20.186
He says the other guy,
Zarazola, is an asshole.

25:22.121 --> 25:25.200
My friend worked in his studio,

25:25.224 --> 25:29.538
and he asked her to blow him.

25:29.562 --> 25:32.040
And she did.

25:32.064 --> 25:33.709
Do you love it here?

25:33.733 --> 25:36.178
Yeah.

25:36.202 --> 25:40.348
So, you're leaving
with Victor for two weeks?

25:40.372 --> 25:42.184
Uh-huh.

25:42.208 --> 25:44.176
Huh.

26:37.730 --> 26:39.775
I'm sorry.

26:39.799 --> 26:41.877
Uh, I didn't mean to interrupt.

26:41.901 --> 26:44.046
No, no, it's okay.

26:44.070 --> 26:46.214
I just needed a pause, you know?

26:46.238 --> 26:47.916
A break.
Yeah, no, I'm not judging you.

26:47.940 --> 26:50.052
Everyone procrastinates.
It's fine.

26:50.076 --> 26:52.020
What is "procrastinate"?

26:52.044 --> 26:54.857
Well, um, procrastination is

26:54.881 --> 26:56.759
when you, uh, do something,

26:56.783 --> 27:00.028
uh, like, uh, play the guitar

27:00.052 --> 27:04.867
to avoid doing something else,
like your work.

27:04.891 --> 27:07.069
Mm.
Mm.

27:07.093 --> 27:08.503
I'm not doing that.
No?

27:08.527 --> 27:11.707
No. I'm working.
Okay. Clearly.

27:11.731 --> 27:14.342
Clearly.

27:14.366 --> 27:18.180
Were you stalking me?
Was I stalking you?

27:18.204 --> 27:20.148
Hmm, yes.

27:20.172 --> 27:21.016
No.

27:21.040 --> 27:22.317
No?
No.

27:22.341 --> 27:24.186
Sure?
I'm pretty sure.

27:24.210 --> 27:28.256
Mm, okay.

27:28.280 --> 27:32.560
Don't, um... don't let me
stop you from playing horribly.

27:32.584 --> 27:33.495
Okay.
Yeah, yeah.

27:33.519 --> 27:36.198
Okay.
Continue.

27:36.222 --> 27:38.691
Listen.
I'm listening.

27:41.227 --> 27:42.938
I can't now.
It's good.

27:42.962 --> 27:44.539
No, it's... keep going.
No, no, somebody...

27:44.563 --> 27:47.710
You got to learn...
You got to start somewhere.

27:47.734 --> 27:49.411
Alex? Are we doing the show?

27:49.435 --> 27:51.413
Man, I need to know.
Yes. Yes.

27:51.437 --> 27:53.716
Yeah, we're doing the...
Yes, we're gonna do the show.

27:53.740 --> 27:55.250
Are you seriously
in Argentina, man?

27:55.274 --> 27:56.852
Listen, I'll be back
in a few days, okay?

27:56.876 --> 28:00.522
I'm... I'm... I'm...
In the meantime, e-mail.

28:00.546 --> 28:02.057
E-mail is better.

28:02.081 --> 28:03.892
Write me, 'cause I can't
hear a word you're saying.

28:03.916 --> 28:07.362
Alex, Alex. Can you hear me?
Are you there?

28:07.386 --> 28:09.732
Josh.

28:09.756 --> 28:11.399
Josh, Josh, Josh, hello?

28:11.423 --> 28:13.960
Buddy?
Hello?

28:21.901 --> 28:24.279
Alex, maybe
if everything goes well

28:24.303 --> 28:26.648
with the paintings,
Victor and I will tour

28:26.672 --> 28:29.184
and we could visit you
in New York.

28:29.208 --> 28:30.385
Oh, it's, uh...

28:30.409 --> 28:33.579
Sofia, could you pass the salad?

28:42.121 --> 28:44.399
Are you going to the, uh,
exhibition with them?

28:44.423 --> 28:46.334
No. I'm staying here.
Oh, you are?

28:46.358 --> 28:48.895
Mm-hmm.

28:52.899 --> 28:54.342
Victor doesn't like the U.S.A.

28:54.366 --> 28:56.544
because he's a Peronist,
you know?

28:56.568 --> 28:58.580
Have you heard... Peronism?
No.

28:58.604 --> 29:00.983
He thinks that
it's an imperialistic country

29:01.007 --> 29:02.717
and that it will fall.

29:02.741 --> 29:04.319
Oh.

29:04.343 --> 29:06.354
Well, you know, yeah.
I mean, I...

29:06.378 --> 29:09.691
Listen, I, yeah, I'm against
all military action,

29:09.715 --> 29:12.227
but I think every country
has its... misery.

29:12.251 --> 29:14.029
I think America's in the
spotlight, of course, because...

29:14.053 --> 29:16.164
You know,
I'm more like an anarchist

29:16.188 --> 29:18.757
because I don't believe
in state that much.

29:26.398 --> 29:27.910
Spotlight?

29:27.934 --> 29:29.544
Yeah, I said spotlight.

29:29.568 --> 29:32.038
Um, why?
America.

29:37.209 --> 29:39.187
America is all the continent.

29:39.211 --> 29:41.223
What does that mean?
All the continent?

29:41.247 --> 29:43.549
No...

30:09.041 --> 30:10.886
What? What?

30:10.910 --> 30:14.756
I think he's saying that you
collaborated with Guantanamo.

30:14.780 --> 30:16.591
Guantanamo. Sí.

30:16.615 --> 30:17.492
Yeah.
No.

30:17.516 --> 30:18.827
In its construction?

30:18.851 --> 30:20.228
I think there's, um,

30:20.252 --> 30:21.997
a lot that's getting
lost in translation.

30:22.021 --> 30:25.224
No, no, no, he didn't say that.
He didn't say that.

30:34.566 --> 30:36.678
What's going on?
Help... Help me.

30:36.702 --> 30:40.072
Victor.

30:50.249 --> 30:53.495
You know, I left
my social class back in 2009

30:53.519 --> 30:56.055
when I finished high school.

31:28.887 --> 31:30.398
It's good to debate ideas.

31:30.422 --> 31:32.334
Don't you think?

31:32.358 --> 31:35.103
In my house, I could never
talk about my anarchism

31:35.127 --> 31:37.763
without my father going insane.

32:23.042 --> 32:26.054
Are you... is that...
Is everything...

32:26.078 --> 32:27.722
Is it because of what
I said about America?

32:27.746 --> 32:29.357
Is that the problem?

32:29.381 --> 32:31.693
No, what do you mean?
Well, what do you mean?

32:31.717 --> 32:35.197
What do you mean?
America?

32:35.221 --> 32:38.390
Yeah.

32:45.564 --> 32:48.234
Yeah, I'll have some.

33:15.227 --> 33:17.039
What is this?

33:17.063 --> 33:18.873
This?
What is that?

33:20.266 --> 33:23.178
That tells me nothing.

33:23.202 --> 33:25.013
Well, I don't know
how to say it in English.

33:25.037 --> 33:26.881
It's chinchulines.

33:26.905 --> 33:28.550
Is it a tapeworm?

33:28.574 --> 33:30.485
Why don't you eat?

33:30.509 --> 33:31.586
'Cause it looks horrible.

33:31.610 --> 33:33.755
You have to. Do you want this?

33:33.779 --> 33:35.914
Yeah, I'll take salad, yeah.

33:48.594 --> 33:53.741
So, how are you doing, cousin?

33:53.765 --> 33:58.413
I'm good. I think
I'm adjusting really well.

33:58.437 --> 34:00.248
Okay.
And everyone likes me.

34:00.272 --> 34:01.416
Yes.

34:01.440 --> 34:03.185
I feel like...
We should toast.

34:03.209 --> 34:05.853
Mm-hmm.
To Aunt Mabel.

34:05.877 --> 34:08.414
What do you think?

34:15.587 --> 34:18.190
We're going out?
We're going out there?

34:29.467 --> 34:31.803
What's going on?

34:33.572 --> 34:36.275
Is he burning paintings?

35:01.300 --> 35:03.369
Victor!

35:07.239 --> 35:08.583
Oh!

35:12.878 --> 35:14.356
I'm sorry.

35:14.380 --> 35:16.924
Holy shit.

35:16.948 --> 35:18.726
I'm sorry.
It's not funny.

35:20.118 --> 35:22.554
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

35:54.220 --> 35:58.065
I-I-I hate
to ask you guys to do this,

35:58.089 --> 36:01.569
but can we have
a conversation in English?

36:01.593 --> 36:05.039
This is a fucking nightmare.

36:09.968 --> 36:11.613
Yes.

36:11.637 --> 36:14.416
You know, when...
When he started showing

36:14.440 --> 36:17.385
in my mom's gallery,

36:17.409 --> 36:20.355
I used to write essays
for the exhibition's catalogues,

36:20.379 --> 36:23.891
and just writing for him
was a nightmare.

36:23.915 --> 36:25.860
I quit.

36:25.884 --> 36:30.064
It was the only way
I could be his girlfriend.

36:30.088 --> 36:33.034
I don't know how you do it.

36:33.058 --> 36:35.461
All that work gone to waste.

36:37.463 --> 36:39.841
Well, you know what?
I'm leaving tomorrow.

36:39.865 --> 36:41.609
So I wish you good luck.

36:41.633 --> 36:43.245
What do you mean, leaving?
¿Qué?

36:43.269 --> 36:46.248
And then you work, your trabajo?

36:47.506 --> 36:50.017
We can't do new work
in two days.

36:50.041 --> 36:51.353
What about the exhibition?

36:51.377 --> 36:53.821
Flor, I don't think it's cool

36:53.845 --> 36:55.423
that you quit
when things get rough.

36:55.447 --> 36:57.191
But you said
that you quit before.

36:57.215 --> 36:59.727
Yes, but it's different.

36:59.751 --> 37:01.229
I'm... I'm his girlfriend.

37:01.253 --> 37:06.858
Well, I guess I'm not,
so I'm leaving tomorrow.

37:12.898 --> 37:15.100
Morning.
Morning.

37:17.703 --> 37:20.348
Where's the rooster?

37:20.372 --> 37:23.050
You don't need a rooster
to lay eggs.

37:23.074 --> 37:24.386
You don't?

37:24.410 --> 37:27.322
The hens just do it fine
by themselves.

37:27.346 --> 37:28.923
I can't believe
I didn't know that.

37:28.947 --> 37:30.758
Hmm.

37:30.782 --> 37:34.996
Listen, uh, the situation
got complicated last night.

37:35.020 --> 37:37.265
Yeah.
Yes.

37:37.289 --> 37:38.766
Yeah.
Hmm.

37:38.790 --> 37:43.338
Um, you know, you won't
have any trouble from me.

37:43.362 --> 37:44.839
No, no, mm.

37:44.863 --> 37:48.376
I know I told you
that you could stay here, but...

37:48.400 --> 37:50.578
Wait.
It's really difficult.

37:50.602 --> 37:52.380
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

37:52.404 --> 37:55.717
You know, he burned those
paintings on purpose, right?

37:55.741 --> 38:00.154
Yes, but, um, that's not
your problem.

38:00.178 --> 38:02.690
I mean, maybe if Victor
wasn't in the picture,

38:02.714 --> 38:05.393
things would be different.

38:05.417 --> 38:08.663
But I'm sorry.
You have to go.

38:08.687 --> 38:10.264
Start thinking
of friends of friends.

38:10.288 --> 38:13.200
You can't...
You can't just do that.

38:13.224 --> 38:17.038
You can't just use me
when it's convenient for you.

38:17.062 --> 38:18.540
But what do you mean "use you"?

38:18.564 --> 38:20.708
You're here
because you need my help.

38:20.732 --> 38:23.745
Really?

38:23.769 --> 38:26.738
You sure I'm not here
because you want to upset him?

38:29.274 --> 38:31.710
I have no choice. I-I'm sorry.

39:20.792 --> 39:23.204
You can't just fabricate
a full-time project.

39:23.228 --> 39:24.706
He said it himself.
But...

39:24.730 --> 39:26.207
His... No, his work was trash,
so he burned it.

39:26.231 --> 39:27.942
That's the concept.
It's genius.

39:27.966 --> 39:29.243
It doesn't work that way.
Why doesn't it work that way?

39:29.267 --> 39:30.712
You used to write his essays.

39:30.736 --> 39:32.447
You can justify anything.

39:32.471 --> 39:34.115
Are you telling me
that you would rather

39:34.139 --> 39:36.551
spend weeks up there with Victor

39:36.575 --> 39:37.852
pissing and moaning
around the house?

39:37.876 --> 39:39.521
I've seen that dynamic, okay?

39:39.545 --> 39:40.922
I know what that looks like.

39:40.946 --> 39:42.557
So?

39:42.581 --> 39:43.925
So...
So.

39:43.949 --> 39:45.427
So all we have to do
is convince him

39:45.451 --> 39:47.361
that it's a good idea.

39:47.385 --> 39:50.064
All of us working for him?
Yeah.

39:50.088 --> 39:52.791
He'll love that, for sure.

40:42.741 --> 40:46.244
I'll talk to him.

40:51.950 --> 40:54.195
He's hard to get, you know,
sometimes,

40:54.219 --> 40:56.864
because he's a genius.

40:56.888 --> 40:59.625
Yeah, I'm sure that's it.

41:00.526 --> 41:04.038
Alex...

41:04.062 --> 41:06.908
if this works, would you mind

41:06.932 --> 41:13.180
if I don't tell my parents
that it was your idea?

41:13.204 --> 41:17.051
Your... your par...
your parents?

41:17.075 --> 41:18.553
Yeah, no, that's fine.
Yeah, yeah, totally.

41:18.577 --> 41:20.855
'Cause, you know,
sometimes it's hard

41:20.879 --> 41:23.424
for them to understand
what I'm doing here.

41:23.448 --> 41:27.529
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

41:27.553 --> 41:31.432
You're so fucking cool,
you know? Thank you.

41:31.456 --> 41:35.269
That's a very thoughtful thing
for you to say.

41:35.293 --> 41:37.438
He's in.

42:03.889 --> 42:06.267
What'd he say?

42:06.291 --> 42:08.727
Like this.

42:59.077 --> 43:01.656
Hey, so, uh, Victor was saying

43:01.680 --> 43:04.525
that since fragments
are accidents

43:04.549 --> 43:07.061
we shouldn't try
to understand it

43:07.085 --> 43:10.531
because, you know, accidents
mustn't be comprehended.

43:10.555 --> 43:12.199
Okay. Bueno.

43:12.223 --> 43:14.368
Just tell us
how he wants it, okay?

43:14.392 --> 43:18.840
Okay, so, um, just group
them by color and size.

43:18.864 --> 43:21.466
Okay?

43:27.906 --> 43:31.943
I love her so much.
Just so much.

43:44.022 --> 43:46.701
I'm an addict!

43:46.725 --> 43:48.335
It's all I can think about.

43:48.359 --> 43:50.537
You can't just
take it away from me.

43:50.561 --> 43:51.873
It's unfair.

43:51.897 --> 43:53.507
You have to, like,
wean me off of it.

43:53.531 --> 43:56.010
You are in rehab here. Okay?

43:56.034 --> 43:58.412
And you will not tweet, period.

43:58.436 --> 44:01.282
Yeah, that's my point.
I'm down here.

44:01.306 --> 44:03.384
I'm in the jungles
of South Africa.

44:03.408 --> 44:04.752
South Africa.
And I can't...

44:04.776 --> 44:06.053
I can't even tweet about it.

44:06.077 --> 44:07.855
I'm like a "Swiss
Family Robinson" member.

44:07.879 --> 44:10.591
I'm so proud. Look at you.

44:10.615 --> 44:12.193
A changed man.

44:12.217 --> 44:15.029
Just keep these memories
and feelings for yourself, okay?

44:15.053 --> 44:16.530
Oh.
Oh.

44:16.554 --> 44:19.224
Oh.

44:31.236 --> 44:34.248
He's a real man's man.

44:34.272 --> 44:35.216
He reminds me of my dad.

44:35.240 --> 44:37.551
Shh.

44:37.575 --> 44:38.585
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

44:38.609 --> 44:39.854
Shh, shh, shh.

44:39.878 --> 44:41.422
What is he?
He's like 65, right?

44:41.446 --> 44:42.890
No.
I'm just saying.

44:42.914 --> 44:45.592
No.

44:45.616 --> 44:47.895
He could be your grandfather.

44:47.919 --> 44:49.163
No.

44:49.187 --> 44:50.431
Easily.

44:50.455 --> 44:53.868
My father. No.
You just said it.

44:53.892 --> 44:56.427
You can't take it back.

45:25.857 --> 45:28.093
Bueno.

45:33.198 --> 45:35.709
Is everything...
Is everything all right?

45:35.733 --> 45:38.245
Yes, yes.
Perfectly fine.

45:38.269 --> 45:39.747
We will do the last one.

45:39.771 --> 45:42.850
When we finish with these two,
we will be done.

45:42.874 --> 45:44.685
Thank you so much, Alex.

45:44.709 --> 45:47.354
Yeah, no, it's fun.
I'm having fun with it.

45:47.378 --> 45:49.256
It's good.

45:58.957 --> 46:01.568
He's saying that he's happy
that you're happy.

46:01.592 --> 46:03.370
Like, we're all happy.

46:03.394 --> 46:06.707
Good. That's good. You ready?

46:06.731 --> 46:10.277
Yes.

46:10.301 --> 46:12.971
No sé.

46:32.891 --> 46:35.169
I wanted to give you something.

46:35.193 --> 46:39.540
It's a little reward
for adapting here.

46:39.564 --> 46:41.108
I think I'm doing
a pretty good job.

46:41.132 --> 46:42.743
I'm enjoying the unplugged life.

46:42.767 --> 46:45.246
Mm-hmm. Where is it?

46:45.270 --> 46:48.115
It's here.

46:48.139 --> 46:53.420
And this.

46:53.444 --> 46:55.689
What is this?

46:55.713 --> 46:58.993
Is this what I think it is?

46:59.017 --> 47:01.062
Oh, my gosh. That's so cool.

47:01.086 --> 47:02.729
You like it?

47:02.753 --> 47:06.033
Well, it was my father's.

47:06.057 --> 47:08.535
And this, too.
He was an architect.

47:08.559 --> 47:11.096
And he spent hours
and hours drawing.

47:13.631 --> 47:15.709
Oh, my gosh.

47:15.733 --> 47:16.944
Wow, look at this.

47:16.968 --> 47:18.279
You're just gonna
give this to me?

47:18.303 --> 47:19.680
Yes.
Are you sure?

47:19.704 --> 47:22.149
Yes, I am sure.
Of course, it's a present.

47:22.173 --> 47:24.852
Thank you.
A reward.

47:24.876 --> 47:26.553
What's that?

47:26.577 --> 47:30.091
I keep it.

47:30.115 --> 47:31.692
Thank you so much.
This is...

47:31.716 --> 47:33.360
You're welcome.

47:33.384 --> 47:34.896
This is really cool.

47:34.920 --> 47:38.123
I haven't drawn in ages.
I can't wait.

49:23.228 --> 49:24.571
The self.

49:24.595 --> 49:26.540
In "Camera Lucida,"
published in 1980,

49:26.564 --> 49:28.175
Roland Barthes describes

49:28.199 --> 49:30.777
how our personality splits
in front of the camera,

49:30.801 --> 49:32.779
unfolding our various selves.

49:32.803 --> 49:34.281
Like Roland,
I suddenly felt like

49:34.305 --> 49:36.350
I was three different people
at the same time.

49:36.374 --> 49:37.884
One, the one I thought I was.

49:37.908 --> 49:40.254
Two, the one I wanted Sofia
to think I was.

49:40.278 --> 49:43.090
And three, the one I feared
Sofia saw in me.

49:43.114 --> 49:45.092
All three combined
in the same body

49:45.116 --> 49:47.328
posing in front
of the camera about to snap.

49:47.352 --> 49:48.762
The timer was ticking.

49:48.786 --> 49:50.597
I wanted Sofia's idea of me
to be

49:50.621 --> 49:52.499
the self I thought I was,
or in all honesty,

49:52.523 --> 49:54.901
the self I thought
I could potentially become.

49:54.925 --> 49:58.005
But a feeling of inauthenticity
started to rush in.

49:58.029 --> 50:00.007
I tried to fight it,
compensating with a pose

50:00.031 --> 50:03.044
that would avoid the idea
I feared Sofia had of me,

50:03.068 --> 50:04.411
but it was too late.

50:04.435 --> 50:06.137
That afternoon,
the picture was taken.

50:30.395 --> 50:33.631
Is that coke?
No, it's MDMA.

50:40.305 --> 50:42.349
You guys are...
You guys are doing ecstasy?

50:42.373 --> 50:43.717
You guys are gonna do ecstasy?

50:43.741 --> 50:45.519
No, MDMA.
Yeah, it's the same thing.

50:45.543 --> 50:47.488
No, it's not.
Are we in 1996?

50:47.512 --> 50:49.090
Yes, we are.
We are?

50:49.114 --> 50:50.424
Yes.
I thought there was

50:50.448 --> 50:53.827
something interesting
about this place.

50:53.851 --> 50:56.363
Come on.
Lick your finger.

50:56.387 --> 50:57.498
No. I'm not gonna do it.

50:57.522 --> 50:59.166
Come on.
No.

50:59.190 --> 51:02.369
Well, I don't want you
to be sober when I'm high, okay?

51:02.393 --> 51:06.540
Come on.

51:06.564 --> 51:09.110
Here.

51:09.134 --> 51:10.744
Be careful, be careful,
be careful. I don't want...

51:10.768 --> 51:12.379
No, no, no, no, no.
I don't want to do that much.

51:12.403 --> 51:13.680
Be careful. Be careful.

51:13.704 --> 51:15.082
Yeah, I don't...
I don't like drugs.

51:15.106 --> 51:16.683
Be careful, be careful.
I don't like drugs.

51:27.785 --> 51:29.620
Oh, my God.

51:34.225 --> 51:38.405
That's the most amazing thing
I've ever seen.

51:38.429 --> 51:41.675
Is she the only one
that does that?

51:48.105 --> 51:51.652
Hi. Hi.

51:51.676 --> 51:57.191
Oh, no.

52:18.536 --> 52:26.387
You should see your face.
Yeah.

52:26.411 --> 52:28.722
You should see your face now.
And you would know.

52:28.746 --> 52:34.261
Yeah, I think I feel something.

52:34.285 --> 52:35.396
Something?

54:00.037 --> 54:02.249
Hey.

54:02.273 --> 54:06.186
Hey.

54:06.210 --> 54:10.223
Are you okay?

54:10.247 --> 54:13.284
I'm fine. Just go.

54:16.687 --> 54:19.223
No, you don't look fine.

54:25.730 --> 54:32.413
You are sweet, you know?

54:32.437 --> 54:38.385
Everything is
so complicated and...

54:38.409 --> 54:41.346
simple at the same time.

54:44.415 --> 54:46.327
Simple?
Mm-hmm.

54:46.351 --> 54:49.830
Sí.

54:49.854 --> 54:55.726
Sí.
Yeah.

55:02.032 --> 55:04.545
Sofia, I'm so sorry.

55:04.569 --> 55:07.113
I was like... I'm high.
I feel terrible.

55:07.137 --> 55:10.150
I'm sorry 'cause, you know,
I think we are friends.

55:10.174 --> 55:12.218
And I value you so much.

55:12.242 --> 55:14.355
And I-I'm sorry.
Please...

55:14.379 --> 55:18.359
Please forgive me, 'cause
I didn't know what I was doing.

55:18.383 --> 55:20.585
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

55:24.221 --> 55:27.000
English.

55:27.024 --> 55:29.035
You should speak in English
'cause Alex is here.

55:39.437 --> 55:42.106
I think you guys need
to, um, talk.

55:45.042 --> 55:46.820
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

55:46.844 --> 55:50.090
You guys were talking, and I
rushed in and made this scene.

55:50.114 --> 55:51.658
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

55:51.682 --> 55:54.719
Flor, Flor, Flor. Flor.

56:26.784 --> 56:30.087
Come with me.

57:18.235 --> 57:22.449
No. No.

57:22.473 --> 57:25.752
Ah.

59:28.232 --> 59:31.077
Hey. They called.

59:31.101 --> 59:36.717
You won't have the appointment
in the embassy for another week.

59:36.741 --> 59:39.319
They give you an exact date?

59:39.343 --> 59:42.412
Yes. Friday the 14th.

59:51.922 --> 59:56.102
Something wrong?

59:56.126 --> 01:00:02.008
Well, by now you should have
a very good picture.

01:00:02.032 --> 01:00:05.211
I don't understand. Um...

01:00:05.235 --> 01:00:07.948
What?

01:00:07.972 --> 01:00:09.850
I don't get you.

01:00:09.874 --> 01:00:15.922
I don't get how one second
everything can be fine

01:00:15.946 --> 01:00:18.191
and then...

01:00:18.215 --> 01:00:19.860
What are you talking about?
You can't just...

01:00:19.884 --> 01:00:21.027
No, no, no, no.
You can't just...

01:00:21.051 --> 01:00:22.562
Wait, wait.
No! No.

01:00:22.586 --> 01:00:23.897
What are you expecting
from the situation?

01:00:23.921 --> 01:00:25.231
I don't understand.

01:00:25.255 --> 01:00:28.434
You can't just live
these two lives

01:00:28.458 --> 01:00:30.737
and then not take responsibility

01:00:30.761 --> 01:00:32.272
when something happens.

01:00:32.296 --> 01:00:33.774
Two lives?
Two lives... a life here...

01:00:33.798 --> 01:00:36.242
Talking to a guy
on the Internet is not a life.

01:00:36.266 --> 01:00:38.578
You're not part of this life.
I'm... All right.

01:00:38.602 --> 01:00:41.047
Well, what the fuck
do you call this?

01:00:41.071 --> 01:00:43.483
Right now. I-I'm here.

01:00:43.507 --> 01:00:44.818
This is happening.
Yes.

01:00:44.842 --> 01:00:46.552
Okay, so what do you call that?

01:00:46.576 --> 01:00:48.488
I don't know. What do you want?

01:00:48.512 --> 01:00:50.356
I don't understand.
I'm trying to speak to you.

01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:52.693
What do you want?

01:00:52.717 --> 01:00:54.060
How... How do I
get out of here?

01:00:54.084 --> 01:00:56.496
How do I fucking
get out of here?

01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:58.064
What?
Where are you going to, Alex?

01:00:58.088 --> 01:01:00.100
I don't care where
I'm gonna fucking go, okay?

01:01:00.124 --> 01:01:03.236
I have... You know what?
You think I have to be here?

01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:05.005
I mean, I have options, okay?

01:01:05.029 --> 01:01:06.873
I am here because
I want to be here.

01:01:06.897 --> 01:01:08.208
Okay.
Okay.

01:01:08.232 --> 01:01:09.776
Go. Use your options,
I'm watching.

01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:11.444
Go. Go.

01:01:11.468 --> 01:01:14.214
I'll fucking swim.
I'll swim out of here.

01:01:14.238 --> 01:01:15.548
Okay.

01:01:15.572 --> 01:01:16.582
All right,
I'll swim away from here.

01:01:16.606 --> 01:01:17.684
Nice, nice.
I'll swim.

01:01:17.708 --> 01:01:21.688
Swim, swim. Swim away. Go. Go.

01:01:21.712 --> 01:01:24.181
I'm gonna go get my shit.
Okay.

01:01:35.259 --> 01:01:37.527
Take my hand.
No, I'm good.

01:02:07.724 --> 01:02:10.928
Yeah?
We have to wait.

01:02:29.013 --> 01:02:30.824
It's really awkward
running into your ex here.

01:02:34.084 --> 01:02:36.196
Well, I can't blame him.
I mean...

01:02:57.441 --> 01:03:02.046
Uh...
It's wine.

01:03:09.386 --> 01:03:12.498
What's he... what is he saying?

01:03:12.522 --> 01:03:16.602
If you're my boyfriend.

01:03:16.626 --> 01:03:20.764
No. No, she's all yours.

01:03:34.711 --> 01:03:36.189
It's not coming.

01:03:36.213 --> 01:03:38.748
We better go back, okay?

01:03:58.802 --> 01:04:01.948
You have to choose.

01:04:01.972 --> 01:04:04.317
What?

01:04:04.341 --> 01:04:07.587
We have two options.

01:04:07.611 --> 01:04:12.758
Tonight, I go to sleep
in my room.

01:04:12.782 --> 01:04:14.194
We wake up tomorrow.

01:04:14.218 --> 01:04:18.364
We have breakfast.
And we become friends.

01:04:18.388 --> 01:04:21.334
Or we have sex now

01:04:21.358 --> 01:04:24.604
and we become lovers
for the next week.

01:04:24.628 --> 01:04:26.539
Until you leave.

01:04:26.563 --> 01:04:29.599
But we won't see
each other again.

01:04:34.638 --> 01:04:36.983
How long do I have to decide?

01:04:37.007 --> 01:04:46.016
Five, four, three, two, one.

01:04:54.224 --> 01:04:56.702
This is what you want?
Yes.

01:04:56.726 --> 01:04:59.263
Yes?
Yeah.

01:05:04.868 --> 01:05:07.047
I've never had sex
in English before.

01:05:07.071 --> 01:05:08.548
Oh, God.

01:05:08.572 --> 01:05:11.408
It's like being
in a porn movie from...

01:05:14.378 --> 01:05:17.323
Do you want to fuck me?

01:05:17.347 --> 01:05:20.217
Yes.
Yes.

01:05:22.786 --> 01:05:25.165
Words don't have
the same semantic importance.

01:05:25.189 --> 01:05:27.067
It's like being someone else.

01:05:27.091 --> 01:05:31.095
Oh, that's a very
interesting point, culturally.

01:05:35.532 --> 01:05:39.436
You're doing...
You're doing great.

01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:42.048
Dude, Energy Yogurt
wants to write checks.

01:05:42.072 --> 01:05:44.017
Are you sitting down?

01:05:44.041 --> 01:05:47.020
$20 grand for you,
$20,000 for me.

01:05:47.044 --> 01:05:49.022
I'm sending you
a preliminary contract.

01:05:49.046 --> 01:05:51.224
Sign it and get it
back to me ASAP.

01:05:51.248 --> 01:05:53.750
Love you, man. Josh.

01:06:19.609 --> 01:06:25.258
♪ Twice I've turned
my back on you ♪

01:06:25.282 --> 01:06:28.428
So you've been working on it
for over a year.

01:06:28.452 --> 01:06:30.196
Yes.

01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:32.432
Has it always been
about the same thing?

01:06:32.456 --> 01:06:34.367
Well, it changed when I met you.

01:06:37.094 --> 01:06:38.038
Okay.

01:06:38.062 --> 01:06:40.206
So I inspired your thesis,

01:06:40.230 --> 01:06:44.110
which is based on
how Internet videos

01:06:44.134 --> 01:06:46.179
destroyed real art.

01:06:46.203 --> 01:06:49.082
No. You didn't inspire it.

01:06:49.106 --> 01:06:50.516
You're so narcissistic.

01:06:50.540 --> 01:06:52.552
Oh.

01:06:52.576 --> 01:06:56.556
I can't work
with a single subject

01:06:56.580 --> 01:06:59.859
because sociology works
with immersion patterns

01:06:59.883 --> 01:07:01.094
and constants, you know?

01:07:01.118 --> 01:07:02.695
Wow.
I don't know why,

01:07:02.719 --> 01:07:07.933
nowadays, everybody thinks
they have a novel in them

01:07:07.957 --> 01:07:10.736
or a music album or a movie.

01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:13.206
Everybody wants to be an artist.

01:07:13.230 --> 01:07:16.342
And we are left
with noise, you know?

01:07:16.366 --> 01:07:20.446
Like, more artists
than audiences.

01:07:20.470 --> 01:07:24.384
And art loses
its intrinsical value.

01:07:27.777 --> 01:07:29.989
Was that your whole thesis?
No.

01:07:30.013 --> 01:07:31.524
Was that it?
No.

01:07:31.548 --> 01:07:33.326
Did you just...
You just memorize it

01:07:33.350 --> 01:07:35.595
and recite it back to me?

01:07:35.619 --> 01:07:38.198
It could be, you know.
I hope you wrote that down.

01:07:38.222 --> 01:07:40.333
So I'm not alone.
I'm not alone, then.

01:07:40.357 --> 01:07:44.370
So... So, you think we should
just do nothing?

01:07:44.394 --> 01:07:49.375
No. I mean, it's about
taking responsibility.

01:07:49.399 --> 01:07:54.771
Maybe doing things but without
showing them to people.

01:08:13.022 --> 01:08:14.900
No!

01:08:33.377 --> 01:08:34.987
Are you ready?

01:08:35.011 --> 01:08:36.589
I guess.

01:08:36.613 --> 01:08:38.591
I don't know what
I'm supposed to be ready for.

01:08:38.615 --> 01:08:41.694
For a ritual.

01:08:41.718 --> 01:08:43.196
Okay.

01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:45.064
I'll be the shaman.

01:08:45.087 --> 01:08:48.201
And this is a funeral.

01:08:48.225 --> 01:08:54.540
You have to bury the tomatoes
here at the beach

01:08:54.564 --> 01:08:57.277
as an offering to the river.

01:08:57.301 --> 01:08:59.444
This is gonna be hard,
because I'm a Taurus.

01:08:59.469 --> 01:09:01.747
I'm less receptive
to black magic.

01:09:01.770 --> 01:09:03.582
What do you think this is?

01:09:03.607 --> 01:09:06.319
Some sort of mystical bullshit?

01:09:06.343 --> 01:09:10.423
It's about tricking
your unconscious mind

01:09:10.447 --> 01:09:13.359
with a performance,

01:09:13.383 --> 01:09:16.220
like behavioral science.

01:09:19.689 --> 01:09:21.834
Okay. Well, can
I say something or...?

01:09:21.858 --> 01:09:26.037
Yes, of course.
But dig the holes first.

01:09:26.062 --> 01:09:28.865
Okay.

01:09:31.901 --> 01:09:35.715
Okay, you have to start,

01:09:35.738 --> 01:09:37.716

01:09:37.741 --> 01:09:47.760
Mm-hmm.
"In body and soul"...

01:09:47.783 --> 01:09:49.694
in body and soul...

01:09:49.719 --> 01:09:53.366
"I will bury
these tomatoes..."

01:09:53.390 --> 01:09:55.835
I will bury these tomatoes...

01:09:55.859 --> 01:09:58.771
"and with them"...
and with them...

01:09:58.795 --> 01:10:02.708
"all the
visual pollution..."

01:10:02.732 --> 01:10:05.177
all the visual pollution...

01:10:05.201 --> 01:10:08.714
"I contributed
to the Internet."

01:10:08.738 --> 01:10:10.983
I contributed to the Internet.

01:10:11.007 --> 01:10:16.689
Okay.

01:10:16.713 --> 01:10:20.393
Amen.

01:10:20.417 --> 01:10:26.499
Amen.

01:10:26.523 --> 01:10:29.702
Now and go and bathe yourself
in the river.

01:10:29.726 --> 01:10:34.464
And then we shall have sex
over the corpses.

I'm ticklish.

01:12:31.948 --> 01:12:35.094
How can you be ticklish
with this tattoo?

01:12:35.118 --> 01:12:36.862
What's the "N"?

01:12:36.886 --> 01:12:39.999
The "N" for north.

01:12:40.023 --> 01:12:43.403
North, oh.
All right.

01:12:43.427 --> 01:12:45.538
What's the "P"?

01:12:45.562 --> 01:12:47.607
The "P" is Paraná.

01:12:47.631 --> 01:12:49.709
Paraná, the river,
the big river.

01:12:49.733 --> 01:12:54.614
Here, it divides
the town in two.

01:12:54.638 --> 01:12:56.248
What about the "D"?

01:12:56.272 --> 01:13:00.753
The "D" is Durazno.

01:13:00.777 --> 01:13:03.989
It's the river by the house.

01:13:04.013 --> 01:13:06.659
It's like peach in English.

01:13:06.683 --> 01:13:11.531
So we were in the Peach River?
Yes, the Peach River.

01:13:11.555 --> 01:13:15.000
I think I'm done.

01:13:15.024 --> 01:13:17.336
Do you like it?

01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:20.072
Yeah, I love it.

01:13:20.096 --> 01:13:21.674
Oh, shit.

01:13:21.698 --> 01:13:23.008

01:13:23.032 --> 01:13:25.044
It's not that...
It's not that big a deal.

01:13:25.068 --> 01:13:28.514
Never mind.
What?

01:13:28.538 --> 01:13:31.350

No.

Yeah.
No!

01:13:33.877 --> 01:13:35.020
Yeah, it's okay. Hold on.

01:13:35.044 --> 01:13:37.156
No.
No, it's all right.

01:13:37.180 --> 01:13:39.492
No, no, stop, stop.
I got it. I got it.

01:13:39.516 --> 01:13:41.160
Are you fucking kidding me, man?

01:13:41.184 --> 01:13:41.994
Please tell me you're kidding.

01:13:42.018 --> 01:13:43.596
Josh. I'm living...

01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:46.766
I'm living things, man,
that are inspiring.

01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:48.367
Okay, I can't come home now.

01:13:48.391 --> 01:13:50.169
I'm in love with this girl.

01:13:50.193 --> 01:13:51.771
Alex.
And, uh...

01:13:51.795 --> 01:13:54.106
You can't do this to me.
Just sell my shit on eBay.

01:13:54.130 --> 01:13:56.175
And you just keep it.
Just keep the money.

01:13:56.199 --> 01:13:58.878
Reverse Engineering Sofia.

01:13:58.902 --> 01:14:00.245
Reverse engineering
is the process

01:14:00.269 --> 01:14:01.914
of disassembling an object

01:14:01.938 --> 01:14:04.517
to analyze its components
and understand its principles.

01:14:04.541 --> 01:14:06.486
Up to this point,
I knew that Sofia

01:14:06.510 --> 01:14:08.320
once had a father
who was an architect,

01:14:08.344 --> 01:14:10.022
that she had an island
in El Tigre,

01:14:10.046 --> 01:14:11.891
where she spent her
childhood vacations,

01:14:11.915 --> 01:14:13.192
and that the family
stopped visiting

01:14:13.216 --> 01:14:15.194
when her father died.

01:14:15.218 --> 01:14:16.896
I knew that that summer
she decided

01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:18.197
to spend three months
on the island,

01:14:18.221 --> 01:14:19.832
which happened to coincide

01:14:19.856 --> 01:14:21.934
with the all-time low
of her relationship with Victor.

01:14:21.958 --> 01:14:23.402
I knew there was a beach,

01:14:23.426 --> 01:14:26.906
a swamp, a chicken,
a river, and a boat.

01:14:26.930 --> 01:14:28.508
There was Flor

01:14:28.532 --> 01:14:30.743
and the thesis Sofia
was writing for over a year now,

01:14:30.767 --> 01:14:32.277
unable to finish.

01:14:32.301 --> 01:14:34.880
In my imagination,
all these were spare parts that,

01:14:34.904 --> 01:14:36.215
thoroughly analyzed,

01:14:36.239 --> 01:14:38.551
could reconstruct
a truth about Sofia.

01:14:38.575 --> 01:14:40.385
They could give me a map.

01:14:40.409 --> 01:14:43.913
But map and territory are known
to be very different things.

01:15:09.472 --> 01:15:11.851
The fuck?
I don't know.

01:15:11.875 --> 01:15:16.188
What time is it?
Go to the living room, Alex.

01:15:16.212 --> 01:15:18.691
Go to the living room.

01:15:18.715 --> 01:15:21.117
Why? What?

01:16:17.306 --> 01:16:19.018
What's going on?
Nothing.

01:16:19.042 --> 01:16:21.353
No, I think
I deserve an explanation.

01:16:21.377 --> 01:16:23.512
Yes, give me a minute, Alex.

01:16:25.849 --> 01:16:28.017
What's going on?

01:16:32.188 --> 01:16:34.891
Is he making fun of me?
No.

01:17:16.399 --> 01:17:19.278
Tell me he's giving you
an explanation right now.

01:17:19.302 --> 01:17:20.946
No, no, 'cause you know what?

01:17:20.970 --> 01:17:23.382
I saved his ass a minute ago.
Let's not forget that.

01:17:23.406 --> 01:17:25.942
Give me a minute, please.

01:17:30.079 --> 01:17:34.760
Hey, hey.
What happened?

01:17:34.784 --> 01:17:36.195
Horrible.
It was awful.

01:17:36.219 --> 01:17:38.530
So, what? He lost?
We don't even know.

01:17:38.554 --> 01:17:39.932
'Cause there were some rumors

01:17:39.956 --> 01:17:42.401
that because he presented
all this new work

01:17:42.425 --> 01:17:43.936
he might not get it.

01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:45.838
And he exploded
in the middle of the exhibition.

01:17:45.862 --> 01:17:47.964
No.
Yes.

01:18:05.882 --> 01:18:07.592
And then he just walked out
with all the paintings?

01:18:07.616 --> 01:18:09.561
Yes, and on the way back,
he started saying

01:18:09.585 --> 01:18:11.663
that he was in love with me
and that he...

01:18:11.687 --> 01:18:13.265
What?! No.
Yes.

01:18:13.289 --> 01:18:15.000
He wants to have kids with me.
He wanted to have kids.

01:18:15.024 --> 01:18:16.501
I don't even want to have kids,
you know?

01:18:16.525 --> 01:18:18.694
Of course, you're young.

01:19:19.789 --> 01:19:22.701
Hey.
Hey.

01:19:22.725 --> 01:19:24.770
So?
So what?

01:19:24.794 --> 01:19:26.438
So wh...?
What?

01:19:26.462 --> 01:19:27.739
So what?

01:19:27.763 --> 01:19:29.341
I-I just can't...

01:19:29.365 --> 01:19:32.544
I just can't believe
how manipulative he is.

01:19:32.568 --> 01:19:34.113
He sabotages

01:19:34.137 --> 01:19:35.580
his own art exhibition again.
Lower your voice.

01:19:35.604 --> 01:19:36.515
And we're supposed
to pick up the pieces?

01:19:36.539 --> 01:19:38.017
Shh!

01:19:38.041 --> 01:19:39.551
Did you know that
he was hitting on Flor?

01:19:39.575 --> 01:19:41.353
On the way back?
Okay. Who are you now?

01:19:41.377 --> 01:19:44.189
The morality police?
You are not in a position...

01:19:44.213 --> 01:19:45.524
No.

01:19:45.548 --> 01:19:48.994
You need to tell him about us.

01:19:49.018 --> 01:19:50.395
You don't have the right

01:19:50.419 --> 01:19:52.031
to make me feel bad
about the situation.

01:19:52.055 --> 01:19:54.457
I'm not being
a bad person, okay?

01:20:22.251 --> 01:20:25.030
Hola.

01:20:25.054 --> 01:20:27.123
Hola.

01:20:30.393 --> 01:20:32.428
I don't want to be here anymore.

01:20:36.065 --> 01:20:39.344
Me neither.

01:21:35.624 --> 01:21:37.536
Alex.

01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:40.105
Can I see your drawings?

01:21:40.129 --> 01:21:42.531
Sure.

01:22:07.723 --> 01:22:10.259
You're talented, you know?

01:22:35.384 --> 01:22:38.454
Let's go.
Let's go outside.

01:22:51.867 --> 01:22:55.304
Let's get those.

01:23:14.223 --> 01:23:15.500
The fuck is he talking about?

01:23:15.524 --> 01:23:18.070
He's just pissed
because I'm helping you.

01:23:18.094 --> 01:23:19.371
He's pissed because
you're helping me?

01:23:19.395 --> 01:23:21.540
Yes.

01:23:21.564 --> 01:23:24.609
I'm so fed up
with this bullshit.

01:23:24.633 --> 01:23:26.611
All right, what is it, man?
What is it now, buddy?

01:23:26.635 --> 01:23:29.105
What do you need?

01:23:33.442 --> 01:23:35.711
Do you

01:23:40.616 --> 01:23:43.086
He's asking if you like chicken.

01:23:45.221 --> 01:23:47.756
What?

01:24:01.537 --> 01:24:02.947
What... what's going on?

01:24:02.971 --> 01:24:05.317
He wants you to kill
a chicken with him.

01:24:05.341 --> 01:24:07.843
What?!

01:24:11.414 --> 01:24:14.326
Are you fucking insane?

01:24:14.350 --> 01:24:16.528
I've never killed anything
before in my life.

01:24:16.552 --> 01:24:20.022
I'm not gonna start with a...
Put it back, man.

01:24:29.932 --> 01:24:31.634
Victor!

01:24:33.402 --> 01:24:35.680
I'm not gonna kill the chicken!
I'm not gonna kill the chicken!

01:25:06.735 --> 01:25:10.273
I don't understand
what you're saying, man.

01:25:26.589 --> 01:25:29.225
Leave her alone.

01:25:32.861 --> 01:25:35.298
Just leave her alone, man.

01:25:38.401 --> 01:25:41.804
Hey! Motherfucker!

01:25:44.473 --> 01:25:47.443
What is that?

01:25:50.746 --> 01:25:53.525
Just settle down, okay?

01:25:53.549 --> 01:25:56.685
Everything's gonna be all right.

01:25:59.588 --> 01:26:02.601
Hey!
Sofia!

01:26:02.625 --> 01:26:05.728
Son of a bitch!

01:26:08.764 --> 01:26:11.300
Okay.

01:26:16.872 --> 01:26:18.583
Put it down, man.

01:26:18.607 --> 01:26:20.943
Put it down.

01:26:27.283 --> 01:26:31.220
I don't speak Spanish!

01:26:36.792 --> 01:26:40.028
Here.

01:26:44.867 --> 01:26:46.778
There you go.

01:26:46.802 --> 01:26:48.771
In your native tongue.

01:26:57.246 --> 01:27:04.929
What? What?

01:27:14.430 --> 01:27:16.932
Sofia?

01:27:19.201 --> 01:27:22.471
My computer is private, okay?

01:27:25.274 --> 01:27:27.552
What?

01:27:27.576 --> 01:27:29.321
Emma fell into the river,

01:27:29.345 --> 01:27:33.549
and she didn't know how to swim,
so I went after her.

01:27:43.058 --> 01:27:45.928
Out. Get out.

01:28:06.949 --> 01:28:08.727
Who was that guy?
How many...

01:28:08.751 --> 01:28:10.329
How many guys are you fucking
around with on the Internet?

01:28:10.353 --> 01:28:13.064
A hundred. Leave me alone.
You're stuck here.

01:28:13.088 --> 01:28:14.866
You're stuck here.
You're stuck with these people.

01:28:14.890 --> 01:28:15.867
Let's get the fuck
out of here, okay?

01:28:15.891 --> 01:28:17.336
No. Where?

01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:18.603
We just need to get
the fuck out of here.

01:28:18.627 --> 01:28:20.104
Where?

01:28:20.128 --> 01:28:21.239
I don't know.
It doesn't matter where we go.

01:28:21.263 --> 01:28:23.041
Where are we going, Alex?

01:28:23.065 --> 01:28:26.411
Did you get all this wrong?
We won't be together.

01:28:26.435 --> 01:28:28.613
No, you're so afraid
of doing anything

01:28:28.637 --> 01:28:30.048
that you make this fucking...

01:28:30.072 --> 01:28:33.251
This mess instead
of facing your shit.

01:28:33.275 --> 01:28:36.020
You're lying to yourself.

01:28:36.044 --> 01:28:40.224
I'm lying. And you?

01:28:40.248 --> 01:28:42.327
Tell me the truth.

01:28:42.351 --> 01:28:44.062
What are you doing here?

01:28:44.086 --> 01:28:46.622
In Argentina?

01:28:50.526 --> 01:28:54.706
I needed to see you.

01:28:54.730 --> 01:28:58.066
And the interview?

01:29:01.269 --> 01:29:03.348
See?

01:29:03.372 --> 01:29:06.017
At least my lies are more
sophisticated than yours.

01:29:06.041 --> 01:29:08.987
Oh, f...

01:29:09.011 --> 01:29:12.857
Why do you do that?
You're such a child.

01:29:12.881 --> 01:29:15.760
You always have to say something
clever or witty or funny

01:29:15.784 --> 01:29:17.762
instead of showing me
who you really are.

01:29:17.786 --> 01:29:20.565
Who the fuck are you?

01:29:20.589 --> 01:29:23.702
Show me who you are
for two seconds.

01:29:23.726 --> 01:29:26.204
I'm sorry.

01:29:26.228 --> 01:29:28.564
I'm sorry.

01:30:11.740 --> 01:30:14.419
Alex, where are you going?

01:30:14.443 --> 01:30:15.754
I'm leaving.

01:30:15.778 --> 01:30:17.922
I'm leaving, too, okay?

01:30:17.946 --> 01:30:20.759
I-I want to leave.
Can I go with you?

01:30:20.783 --> 01:30:22.260
I don't... Sure.
Yes?

01:30:22.284 --> 01:30:25.597
Okay, the next boat is at 7:45.
All right.

01:30:25.621 --> 01:30:30.502
That's in... that's in 22
minutes. Okay?

01:30:30.526 --> 01:30:31.870
I'll get my stuff.

01:30:31.894 --> 01:30:33.938
Will you wait?
Yes.

01:30:33.962 --> 01:30:35.073
Yes?
Mm-hmm.

01:30:35.097 --> 01:30:37.008
Okay.

♪ Twice I turned

Okay.
I'll go that way.

01:31:14.236 --> 01:31:16.715
Okay.
They are black and yellow.

01:31:16.739 --> 01:31:18.249
Remember.

01:31:18.273 --> 01:31:21.209

Energy and spending.

01:33:12.354 --> 01:33:15.066
In 1946, George Patail wrote,

01:33:15.090 --> 01:33:17.736
"A living organism ordinarily
receives more energy

01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:20.238
than is necessary
for maintaining life.

01:33:20.262 --> 01:33:22.240
If the excess cannot
be completely absorbed

01:33:22.264 --> 01:33:25.043
in its growth, it must be spent.

01:33:25.067 --> 01:33:29.380
Willingly or not,
gloriously or catastrophically."

01:33:29.404 --> 01:33:31.282
It's a matter of metabolism.

01:33:31.306 --> 01:33:33.017
All the experiences
I had that summer,

01:33:33.041 --> 01:33:34.986
all these images
I received every day,

01:33:35.010 --> 01:33:36.520
were looking for a way out.

01:33:36.544 --> 01:33:38.156
Somehow.

01:33:38.180 --> 01:33:41.192
So I went on and painted, wrote,
played, sang my story,

01:33:41.216 --> 01:33:43.427
then published it
on endless blogs.

01:33:43.451 --> 01:33:44.896
Places where fruits dance

01:33:44.920 --> 01:33:47.932
or something equally
trivial is expressed.

01:33:47.956 --> 01:33:50.225
As I said, metabolism.

01:33:55.563 --> 01:33:59.778
Alex.

01:33:59.802 --> 01:34:03.882
Are you okay?

01:34:03.906 --> 01:34:05.784
What are you doing here?

01:34:05.808 --> 01:34:10.354
Victor left.

01:34:10.378 --> 01:34:11.723
So?

01:34:11.747 --> 01:34:14.783
And you were
right about everything.

01:34:17.052 --> 01:34:18.362
Well, good.
I'm glad I could help.

01:34:18.386 --> 01:34:19.563
I have to go.
I have my appointment.

01:34:19.587 --> 01:34:20.932
Hey.

01:34:20.956 --> 01:34:23.668
It's not easy
for me to admit things,

01:34:23.692 --> 01:34:25.536
so you have to give me
some credit, okay?

01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:27.706
Congratulations.

01:34:27.730 --> 01:34:30.408
What do you want me to say?

01:34:30.432 --> 01:34:33.235
I want you to come back with me.

01:34:35.637 --> 01:34:37.281
What do you mean?

01:34:37.305 --> 01:34:40.084
To the island, today.

01:34:40.108 --> 01:34:46.324
You can work on your drawings,
and I can finish my writing.

01:34:46.348 --> 01:34:50.853
You have to see how beautiful
is the winter there.

01:35:08.470 --> 01:35:11.406
Welcome!

01:35:16.411 --> 01:35:19.690
Mr. Taylor, are you aware
of the situation...

01:35:19.714 --> 01:35:22.160
The serious situation
that you're in?

01:35:22.184 --> 01:35:24.028
You don't have any documents.

01:35:24.052 --> 01:35:26.765
You lost your passport
or you were robbed.

01:35:26.789 --> 01:35:30.334
I don't know. These questions
will be answered to me.

01:35:30.358 --> 01:35:35.706
Okay? Any misled information,
you're going to jail.

01:35:35.730 --> 01:35:38.877
And not in the United States.

01:35:38.901 --> 01:35:41.880
Mr. Taylor, what do you do?
I'm a filmmaker.

01:35:41.904 --> 01:35:43.882
Excuse me?
I'm a filmmaker.

01:35:43.906 --> 01:35:45.917
Can you be
more specific, please?

01:35:45.941 --> 01:35:47.551
I do animation.

01:35:47.575 --> 01:35:51.255
I'm... I have this project
that I'm planning on doing

01:35:51.279 --> 01:35:52.656
when I get back to New York.

01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:53.925
Yeah, I saw that.

01:35:53.949 --> 01:35:57.195
Um, I'm actually
working on a, um...

01:35:57.219 --> 01:35:59.864
This is what
I've been working on.

01:35:59.888 --> 01:36:01.165
You don't have to get nervous.

01:36:01.189 --> 01:36:02.700
I-I'm sorry.

01:36:02.724 --> 01:36:04.335
Okay, let's look at this.
So, yeah, that's...

01:36:04.359 --> 01:36:06.370
I'm gonna turn that
into an animation project

01:36:06.394 --> 01:36:08.239
in New York and animate that.

01:36:08.263 --> 01:36:12.010
Mm-hmm.

01:36:12.034 --> 01:36:16.547
I'm not interested in what
you're planning to do.

01:36:16.571 --> 01:36:20.384
Tell me... What did you do back
when you were in New York?

01:36:20.408 --> 01:36:23.221
Give me something now or you're
gonna be in a lot of trouble.

01:36:23.245 --> 01:36:24.923
Give me something
I can work with.

01:36:24.947 --> 01:36:27.591
Um, I-I-I-I made a short film.

01:36:27.615 --> 01:36:29.193
You made a short film.
Yep.

01:36:29.217 --> 01:36:32.063
Okay, let's get that.
Three years ago.

01:36:32.087 --> 01:36:36.367
Um, uh...

01:36:36.391 --> 01:36:39.437
Uh, well, the film was called
"Dancing Tomatoes."

01:36:39.461 --> 01:36:40.905
"Dancing Tomatoes."

01:36:40.929 --> 01:36:42.040
And it got a lot of attention,
yeah.

01:36:42.064 --> 01:36:44.542
It, um, it, uh, it was a...

01:36:44.566 --> 01:36:46.210
You're not pulling my leg,
are you?

01:36:46.234 --> 01:36:48.212
I couldn't if I tried.

01:36:48.236 --> 01:36:50.882
"Dancing Tomatoes."

01:36:50.906 --> 01:36:52.750
Just a second.

01:36:52.774 --> 01:36:55.820
"Dancing
Tomatoes."

01:36:55.844 --> 01:36:57.421
You Googling it?

01:36:57.445 --> 01:36:59.157
Well, the United States,

01:36:59.181 --> 01:37:02.060

with an idea like that?

01:37:28.210 --> 01:37:29.888
Yeah, pass, please.
