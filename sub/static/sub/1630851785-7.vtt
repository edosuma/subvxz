WEBVTT

00:05.135 --> 00:07.050
where he tear off the hair
of Chuck Norris' chest.

00:07.094 --> 00:08.269
- The best part--
- I see--

00:08.312 --> 00:09.705
- Pay attention.
- I see it.

00:09.748 --> 00:10.923
- No, 'cause you
on your phone.

00:10.967 --> 00:12.664
- I saw.
That guy kicked that guy.

00:12.708 --> 00:14.057
That guy is Bruce Lee.

00:14.101 --> 00:15.493
He revolutionized
karate flicks, man.

00:15.537 --> 00:17.191
Check it out.

00:17.234 --> 00:19.149
- Where are the dragons?
I thought there'd be dragons.

00:19.193 --> 00:21.499
- Ain't no dragons.
It's just a metaphor.

00:23.632 --> 00:25.068
Josh, could you watch
this movie with me

00:25.112 --> 00:26.287
before I kill our son?

00:26.330 --> 00:27.723
We got a bigger problem

00:27.766 --> 00:29.942
than Shahzad's
horrible taste in movies.

00:29.986 --> 00:33.207
I just found this strange hat
in our daughter's room,

00:33.250 --> 00:36.079
and I know it doesn't belong
to anyone who lives here.

00:36.123 --> 00:37.994
That's where my hat went.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.083
- Oh, it's yours?
- Yeah.

00:40.127 --> 00:41.998
Oh. Huh.

00:42.042 --> 00:45.088
- What?
It's how we rock 'em now.

00:45.132 --> 00:47.612
Nice try.

00:47.656 --> 00:51.225
You've offended me
and my family.

01:00.234 --> 01:02.279
- Heads up.
- Can you knock?

01:02.323 --> 01:04.673
- My bad.

01:04.716 --> 01:08.111
- The dads know about you
and your secret boyfriend.

01:08.155 --> 01:10.244
- Why did you tell them?
- I didn't.

01:10.287 --> 01:11.984
Dad found his hat
in your bedroom.

01:12.028 --> 01:13.551
Just come clean.

01:13.595 --> 01:15.510
- No, I'm not talking to them
about dating.

01:15.553 --> 01:17.294
They're so cringe.

01:17.338 --> 01:19.296
If I need advice,
I'll just call Mom.

01:19.340 --> 01:22.125
- Yeah, you're
with that strategy.

01:29.654 --> 01:31.134
Good morning.

01:31.178 --> 01:33.441
- Hey.
Good morning, Ma.

01:33.484 --> 01:34.964
Oh, is that for me?

01:35.007 --> 01:36.966
- Yeah, I made you
some eggs and coffee.

01:37.009 --> 01:40.187
Oh, what a pleasant surprise.

01:40.230 --> 01:42.841
Wow.
How nice.

01:44.060 --> 01:45.583
You must want something.

01:45.627 --> 01:47.281
- I need some advice
on how to talk to Amira

01:47.324 --> 01:49.109
about the birds and the bees.

01:49.152 --> 01:51.633
I don't want you to be no
great-grandmother no time soon.

01:51.676 --> 01:54.766
- Well, the Bible says
fornication is a sin.

01:54.810 --> 01:56.986
But nobody don't read no Bible.

01:57.029 --> 02:00.032
So my advice to you is shut
your mouth and say nothing.

02:00.076 --> 02:01.817
- Ma, come on, now,
you know I can't do that.

02:01.860 --> 02:03.035
That's my daughter.

02:03.079 --> 02:04.385
Well, then do it your way,

02:04.428 --> 02:06.343
but the more you tell her
not to have sex,

02:06.387 --> 02:07.736
the more she's gonna want to.

02:07.779 --> 02:09.172
That's why preachers' kids

02:09.216 --> 02:10.739
are the freakiest ones
in the church.

02:10.782 --> 02:12.001
- Damn.
- Mm-hmm.

02:12.044 --> 02:13.698
I should've went
to church more.

02:20.357 --> 02:23.143
- Okay, so remember to speak
in general terms.

02:23.186 --> 02:27.103
We're just two dads talking
to their two kids about sex.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.539
Yeah, but why both kids, man?

02:28.583 --> 02:30.150
Shahzad ain't the one
hiding hats.

02:30.193 --> 02:32.021
- No, no, no,
we got to talk to both of them

02:32.064 --> 02:34.415
so it seems natural
and we're not focused on Amira.

02:34.458 --> 02:37.026
- Dig, man. That do sound
like a good idea, hot shot.

02:37.069 --> 02:38.854
You be reading them
parenting books, right?

02:38.897 --> 02:40.682
- Uh-huh, yeah.

02:42.423 --> 02:44.294
Hey, Look who it is--

02:44.338 --> 02:46.296
Amira!
Hi.

02:46.340 --> 02:48.037
- Come on in. Sit down.
- Come on.

02:48.080 --> 02:49.517
What's going on?

02:49.560 --> 02:51.780
Did something happen
to Mom or Grandma?

02:51.823 --> 02:53.434
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
That's not--

02:53.477 --> 02:55.044
- Sit down.
- That is not what we're--

02:55.087 --> 02:56.611
- We just want to
sit down and talk.

02:56.654 --> 02:58.308
- Take a seat.
Relax. Relax.

02:58.352 --> 02:59.962
Ain't nothing bad happening.
We just want to talk.

03:00.005 --> 03:02.399
- Carrot, if you want.
- Hey, where's Shahzad?

03:02.443 --> 03:04.401
- He had to stay after school.
- Oh.

03:04.445 --> 03:05.881
Oh, yeah, the basketball team

03:05.924 --> 03:08.710
made the playoffs,
so he's at practice.

03:12.627 --> 03:15.934
- Hey, Shahzad,
you have a second?

03:15.978 --> 03:17.414
Hi, Rain.

03:17.458 --> 03:20.069
- Um, how many girlfriends
have you had?

03:20.112 --> 03:21.853
Uh...

03:21.897 --> 03:24.421
just one,
but I don't really know

03:24.465 --> 03:26.075
if you can call her
a girlfriend.

03:26.118 --> 03:27.946
She wouldn't tell me
her middle name.

03:27.990 --> 03:29.861
- Could you remove--

03:29.905 --> 03:32.429
Oh.

03:32.473 --> 03:34.257
- Sorry.
- Thanks.

03:34.301 --> 03:36.085
Yeah, it was just a fling.

03:36.128 --> 03:38.566
We were only together
for about a couple weeks.

03:38.609 --> 03:40.568
So you guys hooked up?

03:40.611 --> 03:43.701
- I mean, I wouldn't
necessarily say we hooked up.

03:43.745 --> 03:45.616
Third base?

03:45.660 --> 03:48.445
Second? First?

03:48.489 --> 03:50.273
At any point,
were you ever on the field?

03:50.317 --> 03:54.277
- We definitely made out.
Why are you asking me this?

03:54.321 --> 03:56.279
- I'm trying to prove
my hypothesis.

03:56.323 --> 03:57.715
Which is?

03:57.759 --> 04:00.414
- That you never been
inside a woman.

04:00.457 --> 04:02.894
Kiss me.

04:02.938 --> 04:04.374
What?

04:04.418 --> 04:06.942
Just do it, Shahzad.

04:10.728 --> 04:13.253
- Perfect.
- Wow, really?

04:13.296 --> 04:17.257
- Yeah, now I know for sure
that you're a virgin.

04:17.300 --> 04:20.172
Don't act so sad about it.
I'm one, too.

04:20.216 --> 04:21.739
But I want to get sex
out of the way

04:21.783 --> 04:23.306
before I leave for college.

04:23.350 --> 04:25.526
You're the perfect candidate
to do it with.

04:25.569 --> 04:27.310
I know you'll be gentle
and discreet.

04:27.354 --> 04:28.746
Wait.

04:28.790 --> 04:31.314
You want to have sex
with me right now?

04:31.358 --> 04:33.838
- Not now.
We have practice.

04:33.882 --> 04:37.712
But, yeah, I want to have sex.
That's the important part.

04:37.755 --> 04:39.061
Are you interested or not?

04:39.104 --> 04:42.543
- Yes, absolutely.
100%, I'm in.

04:42.586 --> 04:44.327
Well, I'm not in yet.

04:44.371 --> 04:46.938
- Calm down, Shahzad.
It's just sex.

04:54.990 --> 04:57.514
- This weekend.
- Got ya.

05:01.779 --> 05:03.303
Whoo!

05:03.346 --> 05:05.348
I'm gonna have sex.

05:10.353 --> 05:11.920
So?

05:11.963 --> 05:13.661
- Uh, we just wanted to have
a little check-in.

05:13.704 --> 05:15.010
About?

05:15.053 --> 05:17.926
- You know,
relationships and stuff.

05:17.969 --> 05:19.362
You know, you're young.

05:19.406 --> 05:20.755
You might have
a lot of questions

05:20.798 --> 05:23.279
about relationships and stuff.

05:23.323 --> 05:25.368
- So this is you guys
trying to give me the sex talk.

05:25.412 --> 05:27.675
- No, hold up. Don't be saying
the word "sex" like that.

05:27.718 --> 05:30.068
- Mom already gave me
the talk, remember?

05:30.112 --> 05:32.854
You skipped it because you said
the diagrams were too scary.

05:32.897 --> 05:34.551
They were very graphic.

05:34.595 --> 05:36.553
Hmm, speak for yourself.

05:36.597 --> 05:39.121
Those graphics did the job
when you in the pen.

05:39.164 --> 05:40.688
- I don't want to hear
any of this.

05:40.731 --> 05:42.167
- No, no, no.
- No, no, wait, wait, wait.

05:42.211 --> 05:43.995
- Amira. Amira.
- Wait, wait, wait.

05:44.039 --> 05:45.997
Listen to me.

05:46.041 --> 05:49.392
You'll end up in a situation
where you'll meet a boy.

05:49.436 --> 05:52.090
Mm, maybe he likes to wear
Yankee fitted caps and--

05:52.134 --> 05:53.962
- Or--yeah.
- We just want you to know

05:54.005 --> 05:57.574
we here if you need somebody
to rat to, talk to, you know?

05:57.618 --> 06:00.055
- Actually, um,
I do have some questions.

06:00.098 --> 06:01.404
All right. Here we are.

06:01.448 --> 06:02.971
That's what
we were looking for.

06:03.014 --> 06:05.190
- We got a few answers.
- Yeah, let 'em rip.

06:05.234 --> 06:07.410
- Come on.
- Let's rip, let's chat.

06:07.454 --> 06:10.021
- Okay,
so I was wondering, um--

06:10.065 --> 06:12.328
they call it a "blow job,"
you know?

06:12.372 --> 06:15.244
But where do you blow?
Is it the little tiny hole?

06:15.287 --> 06:16.854
Like an oboe?

06:16.898 --> 06:19.770
Also, if you swallow,
do you become pregnant?

06:19.814 --> 06:21.511
No answer?

06:21.555 --> 06:23.513
Also, I read a great
"Teen Vogue" article

06:23.557 --> 06:25.428
on prostate stimulation.

06:25.472 --> 06:27.299
Okay, well,
I'll send you guys the article,

06:27.343 --> 06:28.692
and you can tell me
your thoughts.

06:28.736 --> 06:31.042
Thanks so much, okay.

06:31.086 --> 06:32.392
Bye.

06:36.134 --> 06:39.137
- Oh, my God,
she sent the article.

06:39.181 --> 06:41.705
- Do you know about this?
- Don't say nothing!

06:43.403 --> 06:46.231
- Wait.
What is milking?

06:46.275 --> 06:48.712
- No, just leave this
right here.

06:56.938 --> 06:59.157
- Hey, did you get everything
on the list I sent you?

06:59.201 --> 07:01.856
- All I got--Forget that list.
All I got is binoculars.

07:01.899 --> 07:03.292
Excuse me,
you dropped something.

07:03.335 --> 07:05.076
A conversation.
Can I pick up on it?

07:05.120 --> 07:06.774
- What about the disguises
and the rope?

07:06.817 --> 07:08.471
- No, listen,
we agreed to follow Amira

07:08.515 --> 07:10.125
to see who she's meeting,
and that's it.

07:10.168 --> 07:13.302
- Yeah, well, if he gets
handsy, I got a stun gun.

07:13.345 --> 07:15.086
- See, you getting overzealous
with it.

07:15.130 --> 07:16.827
Stun gun? Really, Josh?
Come on, man.

07:16.871 --> 07:18.873
This was supposed to be
just an intel mission, man,

07:18.916 --> 07:20.309
- nothing else.
- Oh wait, hold on.

07:20.352 --> 07:22.006
She's coming.

07:22.050 --> 07:24.705
- Oh. Bye, Dad.
- All right, bye.

07:24.748 --> 07:26.881
- Hey, where you going?
- Out.

07:26.924 --> 07:29.492
- With who?
- A friend.

07:29.536 --> 07:32.060
Love you.
Bye.

07:32.103 --> 07:34.236
- Love you.

07:38.153 --> 07:39.284
It's go time.

07:51.383 --> 07:54.604
- Amira's on the move.
I repeat, on the move.

07:58.826 --> 08:03.439
- Yeah, I see. I see her.
She's walking fast.

08:05.006 --> 08:06.921
- Where are you, though?
- I'm right here.

08:06.964 --> 08:09.619
- Jesus Christ, man.
- I'm right here.

08:09.663 --> 08:12.013
- Put your phone--
- I don't--why am I talking--

08:12.056 --> 08:13.841
- I got my phone away.
Let's follow.

08:13.884 --> 08:16.452
- Can we go? Are you ready?
- Yeah.

08:20.978 --> 08:22.545
- She said she was going
to meet a friend,

08:22.589 --> 08:24.242
but she didn't say who.

08:24.286 --> 08:26.680
- Did you ask her who?
- Oh, I'm not gonna do that.

08:26.723 --> 08:28.551
That's a violation
of her privacy.

08:28.595 --> 08:32.729
- No, this is violation
of her privacy.

08:32.773 --> 08:34.339
- Hi.
- What's up?

08:34.383 --> 08:35.384
Javi?

08:37.429 --> 08:39.562
- They just might be talking
about some tutoring stuff.

08:41.738 --> 08:44.698
- Yeah, yeah, if he needs help
in kissing class.

08:51.443 --> 08:53.794
You know how Dominicans are.

08:58.450 --> 09:00.322
Dominicans are
very loving people.

09:00.365 --> 09:02.411
You know how the French do
the two kisses on the cheeks?

09:02.454 --> 09:03.978
Where you think
they got that from?

09:04.021 --> 09:06.589
- Dominicans.
- She lied to me.

09:06.633 --> 09:08.722
It makes me wonder, what else
is she lying about, you know?

09:08.765 --> 09:10.767
We should follow them
and see where they go next.

09:10.811 --> 09:12.203
- Josh, I'm gonna
ask you something.

09:12.247 --> 09:14.075
- What?
- What has gotten into you?

09:14.118 --> 09:16.381
Maybe we should just trust
in my mother's advice

09:16.425 --> 09:18.209
and say nothing, okay?

09:18.253 --> 09:20.516
Be like Bruce Lee.
Be like water.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.431
Not like Jim Kelly.

09:22.474 --> 09:25.521
You come straight out
of a comic book, Mr. Han-man.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.218
- Okay, all right,
let's go home.

09:27.262 --> 09:28.872
- Let's go on home, man.
- Let's go home.

09:28.916 --> 09:31.875
- Let's go home.
- Let's go.

09:31.919 --> 09:33.224
- They all right.
Let's--

09:33.268 --> 09:35.226
You know what, Josh?
God damn it.

09:40.536 --> 09:42.233
Hey, how you doing?

09:42.277 --> 09:44.279
Um, I'd like to have a room,
please--king-size bed.

09:44.322 --> 09:46.150
- How long?
- Cal King.

09:46.194 --> 09:47.630
I heard it's longer.

09:47.674 --> 09:49.632
- No. How long do you want
the room for?

09:49.676 --> 09:51.895
20 minutes, 40 minutes,
an hour?

09:53.505 --> 09:54.898
- One hour.
- Mm.

09:54.942 --> 09:56.944
Look at you.

09:56.987 --> 10:00.425
- Here you go.
- Uh-uh. Cash only.

10:00.469 --> 10:03.428
- Who carries cash anymore?
- They do.

10:06.693 --> 10:08.477
- Come on, son,
I'm on my lunch break.

10:08.520 --> 10:10.566
I got 35 minutes on my meter.

10:13.264 --> 10:15.353
Think we lost them?

10:16.703 --> 10:18.661
They're still following us.

10:23.100 --> 10:25.276
Whatchu wanna do?

10:26.974 --> 10:29.063
You know what would really
make their heads explode?

10:29.106 --> 10:31.065
- We're going in here.
- You're crazy.

10:38.115 --> 10:40.074
Let's check it out.

10:42.903 --> 10:45.209
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

10:45.253 --> 10:46.558
Three Xs.

10:48.604 --> 10:51.694
This is a sex shop.
Now we got to do something.

10:51.738 --> 10:53.870
- I thought Roberta said
to say nothing.

10:53.914 --> 10:55.611
- Yeah,
she said, "Say nothing."

10:55.655 --> 10:57.961
She ain't say nothing about,
"Don't do nothing."

10:58.005 --> 11:00.703
- What is that?
- I don't know what that is.

11:00.747 --> 11:02.487
Look like a fist.
I don't know what it is.

11:12.672 --> 11:16.023
- This is not the kind
of father that I wanted to be--

11:16.066 --> 11:17.807
hiding behind
a vibrating horse,

11:17.851 --> 11:21.550
watching my daughter browse
in a sex shop.

11:21.593 --> 11:24.118
- You watch your mouth.
Do you understand me?

11:24.161 --> 11:25.772
Don't you ever mention vibrate

11:25.815 --> 11:28.165
while our daughter
is browsing a sex shop, never.

11:28.209 --> 11:31.560
- What happened
to our sweet little girl?

11:31.603 --> 11:34.258
Something really changed,
like, three years ago.

11:34.302 --> 11:35.651
- So what you trying to say--

11:35.695 --> 11:37.479
Amira's wilin' out
because of me?

11:37.522 --> 11:41.004
- No, no. I mean, just Shay
and I, we worked really hard

11:41.048 --> 11:43.180
to set boundaries for her,
and you come into her life,

11:43.224 --> 11:45.139
and you let her think she can
get away with anything.

11:45.182 --> 11:47.750
- That's just another fancy way
of saying it's my fault, okay?

11:47.794 --> 11:49.752
Maybe you didn't raise
her right.

11:49.796 --> 11:51.362
Okay, I've seen "Caligula,"

11:51.406 --> 11:54.583
and everybody on that ship
daddy was white.

11:54.626 --> 11:56.585
- If you two aren't gonna ride
the horsey,

11:56.628 --> 11:58.282
would you please move away
from my store?

11:58.326 --> 11:59.936
- Sorry about that.
- You're creeping people out.

11:59.980 --> 12:01.938
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

12:01.982 --> 12:03.679
Sorry.

12:03.723 --> 12:05.289
I think we can both agree

12:05.333 --> 12:07.335
we haven't always been
the best role models.

12:07.378 --> 12:08.945
Well, I will admit, you know,

12:08.989 --> 12:10.599
I wasn't no angel
when I was her age.

12:10.642 --> 12:12.383
I spent a lot of time
in stairwells.

12:12.427 --> 12:14.951
- Really? I was always
under the bleachers.

12:14.995 --> 12:16.648
It's like
the white man's stairwell.

12:16.692 --> 12:18.825
- Well, no wonder
she got daddy issues.

12:18.868 --> 12:21.218
Most people got one bad daddy.
She got two.

12:23.873 --> 12:26.789
- Oh, no, here they come.
Go, go, go, go...

12:26.833 --> 12:29.400
Oh, my God.

12:29.444 --> 12:31.228
They are so lame.

12:31.272 --> 12:32.969
Are they just gonna follow us
around all day,

12:33.013 --> 12:35.972
or are they gonna make a move?

12:36.016 --> 12:39.149
I mean, it's kind of cool.

12:39.193 --> 12:41.630
It's like we're in a spy movie
or something.

12:44.459 --> 12:45.982
I know how to end this.

12:46.026 --> 12:47.201
Come on.

12:51.814 --> 12:54.599
- At least we're trying.
I mean, this shit is hard.

12:54.643 --> 12:56.297
I wish Shay was here to help.

12:56.340 --> 12:58.125
- Shay was just like Amira
when she was young, man.

12:58.168 --> 12:59.822
Had that
little rebellious stage,

12:59.866 --> 13:02.825
but thank God
everything worked out.

13:02.869 --> 13:06.220
- Wait, if Shay
was just like Amira,

13:06.263 --> 13:08.744
that makes you Javi.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.224
Shit, you right.

13:10.267 --> 13:11.834
- They just went
in the pharmacy.

13:11.878 --> 13:14.619
- We got to stop them now.
Come on.

13:14.663 --> 13:16.447
Go, go, go, go, go.

13:31.506 --> 13:33.377
Are you sure this is cool?

13:33.421 --> 13:35.640
- Oliver's parents are in Dubai
or Hong Kong.

13:35.684 --> 13:37.512
Trust me, it's gonna be okay.

13:44.345 --> 13:45.868
- Welcome
to The Smush House, guys.

13:45.912 --> 13:48.262
It's $15 for her,
$30 for you, cash only.

13:48.305 --> 13:49.872
No Venmo?

13:49.916 --> 13:51.874
- Do I look like a congressman
from Florida?

13:51.918 --> 13:53.789
Ugh, fine.

13:55.922 --> 13:59.664
- All right, have fun smushin',
you crazy kids.

13:59.708 --> 14:03.016
- You had cash this whole time?
- Yep.

14:08.630 --> 14:12.068
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

14:12.112 --> 14:13.940
Excuse me, ma'am, do you guys

14:13.983 --> 14:17.508
have ultra-ribbed magnum
Consent-ex condoms, please?

14:17.552 --> 14:21.599
- Let me check. Do we have
Consent-ex condoms back there?

14:21.643 --> 14:23.427
Y'all getting rubbers?

14:23.471 --> 14:25.299
It's Taser time.

14:41.924 --> 14:43.578
- I told you not to
bring that thing.

14:45.362 --> 14:47.843
Oh, my God

14:47.887 --> 14:49.801
Hey.

14:49.845 --> 14:52.979
- Well, I hope you proud
of yourself, Amira.

14:54.806 --> 14:58.027
Your little jokes and antics
could've got this man hurt.

14:58.071 --> 14:59.724
You followed us.

14:59.768 --> 15:01.552
- Yeah, that's why
we were messing with y'all.

15:01.596 --> 15:03.337
- Hey, if you were truthful
about who you were meeting,

15:03.380 --> 15:04.860
none of this
would have ever happened.

15:04.904 --> 15:07.776
- I was truthful.
Javi is my friend.

15:07.819 --> 15:09.691
- Mm-mm.
That's a lie of omission.

15:09.734 --> 15:11.519
Tray's my friend,
but I don't kiss him.

15:11.562 --> 15:13.564
- Go to sex shops
or buy condoms.

15:13.608 --> 15:15.044
Javi's more than a friend.

15:15.088 --> 15:16.959
- Can you guys stop
treating me like a baby?

15:17.003 --> 15:19.875
To me, you are my baby, okay?

15:19.919 --> 15:22.095
I just found out about you
three years ago.

15:22.138 --> 15:25.489
So, to me, in my mind,
that makes you three.

15:25.533 --> 15:26.969
I'm not three.

15:27.013 --> 15:29.406
I'm 17, and I'm about
to go to college.

15:29.450 --> 15:32.018
Amira, I know you 17,

15:32.061 --> 15:34.803
but I just got here.

15:34.846 --> 15:36.936
I feel like you leaving
the nest already.

15:38.807 --> 15:41.375
That's all.

15:41.418 --> 15:44.247
- Listen, everything's
gonna be okay.

15:44.291 --> 15:46.380
Look, I have two great dads
who taught me

15:46.423 --> 15:48.686
to never let me
blow up my life.

15:51.298 --> 15:53.387
Come here.

15:53.430 --> 15:56.738
- Hey, that's what
I like to see.

16:00.872 --> 16:03.005
- Nuh-uh.
- I got it.

16:03.049 --> 16:05.051
Oh, whoa, whoa.

16:06.574 --> 16:08.141
- What, you got to pee?
- No.

16:08.184 --> 16:09.751
- The Taser make you
feel that way.

16:09.794 --> 16:11.622
- No, it's worse.
I can't find my phone.

16:11.666 --> 16:14.016
Oh, I got you, Dad.

16:14.060 --> 16:17.715
Here, let me check
your location.

16:17.759 --> 16:20.892
- Upper East Side?
What's my phone doing up there?

16:20.936 --> 16:22.503
That's not your phone.

16:22.546 --> 16:24.896
That's Shahzad.
Your phone's in the pharmacy.

16:24.940 --> 16:27.421
- I did not know Shahzad kicked
it on the Upper East Side.

16:27.464 --> 16:29.118
That's because he doesn't.

16:29.162 --> 16:31.729
- The only thing that's up
there is The Smush House.

16:31.773 --> 16:33.079
- What the hell
is a smush house?

16:33.122 --> 16:34.863
- It's dope--
that's where people

16:34.906 --> 16:37.213
in Amira's school
go to take drugs and have sex.

16:37.257 --> 16:38.562
Oh.

16:38.606 --> 16:40.825
- We've never been.
I've just heard.

16:40.869 --> 16:42.479
- We got to go up there
right now.

16:42.523 --> 16:44.046
- Are you about to do
to Shahzad

16:44.090 --> 16:45.221
what you just did to me?

16:45.265 --> 16:46.570
- Yes.
- Absolutely.

16:46.614 --> 16:48.268
- Awesome.

16:48.311 --> 16:51.140
I'll call an Uber.
We'll get there so much faster.

17:01.933 --> 17:04.675
Man, I've seen crack houses

17:04.719 --> 17:06.416
with more supervision
than this.

17:06.460 --> 17:09.419
- Yeah. I can't believe
that kid didn't take Venmo.

17:09.463 --> 17:12.422
- You never brought my daughter
here before, right?

17:12.466 --> 17:13.902
Never, sir.

17:13.945 --> 17:17.253
- Y'all not smushing?
- Hell, no.

17:17.297 --> 17:19.125
- Let me tell you
something, man.

17:19.168 --> 17:21.910
I swore I would never
go back to jail.

17:21.953 --> 17:23.912
But for my daughter, I will.

17:23.955 --> 17:25.740
- Are we clear?
- Yes, sir.

17:25.783 --> 17:27.481
- You swear
on your mother's life?

17:27.524 --> 17:29.787
- I swear.
- Let's go.

17:33.878 --> 17:36.142
Wait, you're leaving already?

17:36.185 --> 17:40.059
- Yeah, turns out
I'm not really a cuddler.

17:40.102 --> 17:42.104
Thanks again
for the help, Shahzad.

17:42.148 --> 17:44.106
It was better
than I thought it'd be.

17:44.150 --> 17:46.369
- Well, can I at least
get a hug?

17:54.464 --> 17:57.119
- Rain?
- Nice, dude.

17:57.163 --> 18:00.514
- Wait, she's fully clothed,
and you're naked in bed?

18:00.557 --> 18:03.125
- Please tell me
you kept your socks on,

18:03.169 --> 18:06.172
'cause you're
not ready for love.

18:11.829 --> 18:13.831
You didn't listen, did you?

18:18.619 --> 18:21.752
What part of "do nothing"
didn't you understand?

18:21.796 --> 18:24.146
- I should've listened
to you, Ma.

18:24.190 --> 18:27.149
Turns out one was a prankster,
and one's was a freak.

18:27.193 --> 18:29.412
Tray, they're growing up.

18:29.456 --> 18:32.589
They do things that you
better off not knowing about.

18:32.633 --> 18:34.722
Why you think I never asked
why you spent

18:34.765 --> 18:37.681
so much time with Maxine
in the projects' stairwell?

18:39.379 --> 18:40.858
You knew about that?

18:40.902 --> 18:44.688
- Everybody in the projects
knew about that!

18:44.732 --> 18:46.473
You have a very distinct moan.

18:46.516 --> 18:49.606
- Yeah, Ma, but I kept
my socks on, so it don't count.

18:49.650 --> 18:52.000
- Well, that's good,
because back then,

18:52.043 --> 18:54.742
you were not ready for love.

18:54.785 --> 18:56.439
And, also,

18:56.483 --> 19:00.400
that's why we don't talk
about things like this.

19:02.184 --> 19:04.926
Which one of my grandbabies
is a freak?

19:04.969 --> 19:07.972
- We not gonna talk about it.
- I bet it was Shahzad.

19:09.365 --> 19:11.193
Not just a freak.

19:11.237 --> 19:13.717
He's a witty-bitty
bing-bong freak.

19:13.761 --> 19:15.458
Oh.

19:30.691 --> 19:33.824
- Hey, you're that--
- Yep.

19:33.868 --> 19:35.609
Have a nice day.

19:35.652 --> 19:37.524
Yeah, enjoy your lunch.

19:37.567 --> 19:39.221
I always do.

19:39.265 --> 19:41.092
- Mm-hmm.
