02:12.750 --> 02:13.750

02:15.458 --> 02:16.458

02:17.583 --> 02:18.583

02:20.208 --> 02:21.208

02:22.750 --> 02:23.750

02:41.666 --> 02:42.708
Xiaoyun,

02:42.833 --> 02:44.083
are your parents fighting again?

02:46.833 --> 02:47.583
No.

02:49.416 --> 02:51.541
I could hear them shouting.

02:52.125 --> 02:54.083
Why don't I talk to them?

02:54.875 --> 02:56.041
Aunt Zhang,

02:56.041 --> 02:57.375
everything's fine.

02:57.666 --> 02:58.666
Xiaoyun...

03:19.583 --> 03:20.583
95

03:22.166 --> 03:23.250

03:25.291 --> 03:26.875

03:36.458 --> 03:38.583

03:49.916 --> 03:50.833
Hello,

03:52.166 --> 03:53.083
is this the police?

04:38.250 --> 04:47.541
Nation T

04:50.625 --> 04:51.333
Mr. Jiang,

04:52.291 --> 04:55.291
have you marked all the memories you wish to delete?

04:55.750 --> 04:56.875
Yes.

04:58.833 --> 05:00.000
Have a seat.

05:08.791 --> 05:09.750
Relax,

05:10.291 --> 05:12.000
we will now begin removing your memories.

05:35.916 --> 05:38.791
Midnight Rain

05:49.833 --> 05:50.791
Mr. Jiang,

05:51.750 --> 05:54.166
did you experience any discomfort, anger,

05:54.166 --> 05:56.750
or any other noticeable sensation?

05:59.875 --> 06:00.000
I can't remember.

06:00.000 --> 06:00.958
I can't remember.

06:01.083 --> 06:03.666
Congratulations, your memories were successfully removed.

06:04.208 --> 06:05.000
Mr. Jiang,

06:05.000 --> 06:07.416
we need a blood sample for DNA matching.

06:12.833 --> 06:14.958
This acts as the password for retrieving your memories.

06:18.500 --> 06:20.166
Why do I feel like

06:21.000 --> 06:23.583
I can still recall so much of my memories?

06:23.916 --> 06:26.041
Many people have misconceptions.

06:26.125 --> 06:28.125
It isn't simply about the removal of memories.

06:28.583 --> 06:30.000
It's that in these memories,

06:30.125 --> 06:32.416
your perspective changes from participant to spectator,

06:32.583 --> 06:34.500
thus severing the emotional ties.

06:35.208 --> 06:36.541
This key is yours.

06:37.166 --> 06:39.291
If you'd like to restore your memories,

06:39.500 --> 06:40.958
please bring this.

06:44.916 --> 06:47.125
Are there this many people everyday?

06:47.291 --> 06:49.916
We have 17 Master of Memory Centers worldwide.

06:50.041 --> 06:51.625
This is the only one in Asia.

06:51.625 --> 06:53.875
So every extracted memory in Asia

06:54.375 --> 06:55.958
is stored right here.

06:55.958 --> 06:57.250
You can imagine

06:57.500 --> 06:59.666
just how many people's memories are here.

07:03.541 --> 07:06.000
Mr. Jiang, have you been working on a new novel?

07:06.916 --> 07:07.375
Ah, yes.

07:07.541 --> 07:08.916
I've read all your works.

07:09.125 --> 07:10.250
My favorite is "Silent Bird".

07:10.500 --> 07:11.958
Now that it's become a TV series

07:12.000 --> 07:13.625
everybody in the office is watching it.

07:15.208 --> 07:16.166
You're good to go.

07:17.708 --> 07:18.958
Rest assured,

07:19.041 --> 07:20.375
our customer service is handled one-on-one

07:20.625 --> 07:22.250
and we have strict confidentiality rules.

07:23.458 --> 07:24.583
So,

07:26.666 --> 07:29.916
the contents of my memories are absolutely secure?

07:30.125 --> 07:31.041
Of course.

07:31.375 --> 07:32.708
There's no machine in the world

07:32.708 --> 07:34.666
that can read the contents of your memory chip.

07:35.875 --> 07:36.791
My apologies.

07:37.083 --> 07:38.041
-Not at all. -Please follow me.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.583
What's wrong with you?

07:41.250 --> 07:42.000
Call security.

07:42.458 --> 07:44.041
Go restore your memories.

07:44.583 --> 07:46.500
-Give me her memories. -Calm down.

07:46.875 --> 07:47.708
Give me.

07:48.083 --> 07:48.916
Don't worry.

07:49.000 --> 07:49.875
Get away from me!

07:51.416 --> 07:52.708
Restore her memories.

07:53.208 --> 07:53.958
Now!

07:54.375 --> 07:56.166
What are you doing, put the gun down!

08:10.291 --> 08:11.708
Get your memories back.

08:16.833 --> 08:17.833
Get them back.

08:18.875 --> 08:21.000
You already had your chance.

08:24.500 --> 08:25.916
Please.

08:30.625 --> 08:31.875
It's too late.

08:33.750 --> 08:36.083
This was already my second procedure.

08:41.500 --> 08:43.791
Those memories are gone forever.

09:00.541 --> 09:01.666
That's alright,

09:02.375 --> 09:04.000
you can have mine.

09:31.958 --> 09:33.625
I signed the divorce agreement,

09:33.750 --> 09:35.000
I made no changes.

09:35.125 --> 09:36.333
Sign it.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.708
If you want to review the division of assets

09:40.708 --> 09:42.416
feel free to read it again.

09:44.291 --> 09:46.583
As for this apartment, I'm planning on selling it.

09:46.750 --> 09:47.708
We split 50/50.

09:48.250 --> 09:50.416
I already have an agent working on it.

09:55.041 --> 09:55.833
What?

09:56.333 --> 09:57.916
Wasn't divorce your idea?

10:00.166 --> 10:01.875
Can you wait a moment?

10:03.125 --> 10:04.541
There's something I want to tell you.

10:06.750 --> 10:07.625
Go ahead.

10:12.125 --> 10:13.833
I want to speak to my husband.

10:15.625 --> 10:17.291
Technically, I still am.

10:18.916 --> 10:21.500
You're not acting like my husband at all.

10:22.833 --> 10:24.041
Let me ask you,

10:25.791 --> 10:28.291
do you remember where you proposed to me?

10:28.791 --> 10:29.875
And where we went for our honeymoon?

10:29.875 --> 10:30.000
I proposed to you on the rooftop.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.791
I proposed to you on the rooftop.

10:33.083 --> 10:34.708
We were poor then

10:35.125 --> 10:36.833
and couldn't afford a honeymoon.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.416
I can remember these clearly.

10:40.708 --> 10:42.416
What the surgery removed are

10:43.291 --> 10:44.833
specific details and emotions.

10:50.625 --> 10:52.500
In any case,

10:54.250 --> 10:55.500
if you don't get your memories back,

10:55.500 --> 10:56.958
I'm not signing this.

11:17.875 --> 11:18.833
Mr. Jiang,

11:18.833 --> 11:20.208
we will begin restoring your memories.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.041
Excuse me,

11:36.041 --> 11:37.541
I've kept you two waiting.

11:38.875 --> 11:39.750
Mr. Jiang,

11:39.791 --> 11:41.291
I'm prescribing you sleeping pills.

11:41.541 --> 11:43.250
This will help you enter deep sleep.

11:43.750 --> 11:44.791
Normally,

11:44.791 --> 11:46.458
it will take 2 or 3 sleep cycles

11:46.541 --> 11:49.000
to re-activate your memories,

11:49.291 --> 11:50.750
that is, to restore them.

11:51.333 --> 11:53.083
But I must warn you.

11:53.083 --> 11:55.291
Using this method to restore your memories,

11:55.500 --> 11:57.000
once 72 hours have passed,

11:57.250 --> 11:58.958
those memories will be permanent.

11:59.500 --> 12:00.000
Do you mean to say,

12:00.000 --> 12:01.583
Do you mean to say,

12:01.875 --> 12:04.333
if I want to remove these memories again,

12:05.041 --> 12:06.625
I'd need another operation

12:06.750 --> 12:07.833
within 72 hours?

12:08.083 --> 12:08.750
To be specific,

12:08.791 --> 12:12.416
the 72 hours begins once your memory starts to restore itself.

12:12.708 --> 12:14.000
Also, the next operation wouldn't be an extraction,

12:14.166 --> 12:15.500
it would be a permanent deletion.

12:15.708 --> 12:16.916
With current technology,

12:17.083 --> 12:19.208
it's impossible to store the memories a second time.

12:20.083 --> 12:21.166
During this time,

12:21.208 --> 12:23.125
Mr. Jiang, you can think everything through.

12:23.208 --> 12:25.458
If you'd like to proceed with the surgery

12:25.625 --> 12:26.916
please let us know in advance.

12:30.125 --> 12:31.791
-Then I'll -Feng,

12:37.291 --> 12:39.416
Can you wait for your memories to come back

12:39.833 --> 12:41.458
before making a decision?

13:17.916 --> 13:19.625
I was about to order delivery.

13:22.875 --> 13:24.250
I brought food for you,

13:25.291 --> 13:26.000
medicine,

13:26.333 --> 13:27.083
books,

13:27.333 --> 13:28.458
and some clean clothes.

13:28.583 --> 13:29.416
Thanks.

13:29.791 --> 13:30.000
I saw her.

13:30.000 --> 13:30.833
I saw her.

13:31.333 --> 13:32.916
She's fine, don't worry.

13:40.791 --> 13:41.500
Hello?

13:42.791 --> 13:43.791
Huilan

13:46.583 --> 13:48.375
I just wanted him to know I'm OK.

13:54.958 --> 13:56.083
If you do this,

13:56.166 --> 13:57.625
then what's the point of hiding?

14:21.041 --> 14:22.250
You're right.

14:27.333 --> 14:28.833
Thank you for all your help.

14:29.083 --> 14:30.000
But there are some things that

14:30.000 --> 14:30.541
But there are some things that

14:30.625 --> 14:32.666
I have to clear up with him in person.

14:33.125 --> 14:34.083
OK, I'll come with you.

14:34.458 --> 14:35.541
Don't.

14:36.333 --> 14:38.041
I can handle this myself.

15:34.041 --> 15:37.000
You've really mixed my memories up.

15:37.041 --> 15:37.833
Mr. Jiang,

15:37.875 --> 15:39.625
we've all signed confidentiality agreements.

15:39.750 --> 15:41.375
We don't know the contents of your memories.

15:41.416 --> 15:42.416
Which is to say,

15:42.458 --> 15:44.583
we are responsible for safekeeping your memory chip,

15:44.666 --> 15:45.958
but not for its contents.

15:46.458 --> 15:48.083
Well, memories must at least be sequential, right?

15:48.333 --> 15:51.041
They can't just be random fragments with no context.

15:51.125 --> 15:54.166
Didn't I say it takes 3 days to fully restore your memories?

15:54.291 --> 15:57.083
Maybe in a few days, you'll have the context to make sense of it.

15:57.500 --> 15:58.750
Mr. Jiang, how about I...

15:59.541 --> 16:00.000
If it's our problem, we will take responsibility.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.666
If it's our problem, we will take responsibility.

16:01.666 --> 16:04.208
But all your suspicions now have no basis.

16:04.583 --> 16:05.916
It's pure speculation.

16:06.125 --> 16:07.458
I've done my research.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.833
This surgery hasn't been approved in several countries.

16:09.833 --> 16:12.750
That must mean there are problems with it.

16:19.291 --> 16:20.291
Mr. Jiang,

16:20.791 --> 16:22.708
are you familiar with plastic surgery

16:22.791 --> 16:24.583
and its history of development?

16:25.416 --> 16:26.666
I'll tell you.

16:27.333 --> 16:30.000
Many soldiers returned from World War I with facial injuries.

16:30.000 --> 16:30.500
Many soldiers returned from World War I with facial injuries.

16:30.666 --> 16:32.875
Plastic surgery at the time

16:32.875 --> 16:35.000
was not simply about facial reconstruction,

16:35.000 --> 16:36.958
it was about rebuilding self-confidence

16:37.125 --> 16:39.291
to help return people to their normal lives.

16:39.291 --> 16:40.250
Nowadays,

16:40.416 --> 16:42.333
plastic surgery has transitioned from fixing problems

16:42.541 --> 16:44.291
to enhancing beauty features.

16:44.333 --> 16:46.583
Everybody can become more beautiful.

16:46.666 --> 16:47.791
Why are you telling me this?

16:48.125 --> 16:49.250
Allow me to finish.

16:50.041 --> 16:52.958
But if the purpose of the surgery is now beauty,

16:53.125 --> 16:54.916
it opens another possibility:

16:55.041 --> 16:56.500
helping criminals to hide their identities

16:56.500 --> 16:58.250
and escape the law.

16:59.041 --> 17:00.000
Do you believe this is fair?

17:00.000 --> 17:00.250
Do you believe this is fair?

17:01.666 --> 17:04.375
Our surgery is no different from plastic surgery.

17:04.666 --> 17:06.250
One is for physical defects.

17:06.375 --> 17:08.250
The other is for emotional trauma.

17:08.625 --> 17:11.250
The original motivations of these surgeries are good.

17:11.291 --> 17:14.416
But the key lies in the user's intentions.

17:14.625 --> 17:15.916
What are you saying?

17:17.125 --> 17:18.291
What I'm saying is,

17:18.833 --> 17:21.583
how would I know whether you've stored sentimental memories

17:21.708 --> 17:23.375
or memories of murder?

17:25.875 --> 17:26.833
What did you say?

17:26.875 --> 17:27.250
Please

17:27.250 --> 17:28.333
leave.

17:32.375 --> 17:33.291
Help!

17:33.791 --> 17:35.000
Police!

17:44.708 --> 17:46.208
I got injured falling off my bike.

17:46.833 --> 17:48.041
It's obviously from Dad hitting you.

17:48.041 --> 17:49.333
-Don't talk nonsense. -Please lie down.

17:49.375 --> 17:50.541
It will only get worse.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.958
These are the medical records you wrote for Li Huilan.

17:52.958 --> 17:54.250
Can you confirm?

17:56.333 --> 17:57.666
I don't need to see it.

17:57.666 --> 17:59.000
Last year, June 9th.

17:59.000 --> 18:00.000
Two rib fractures,

18:00.000 --> 18:00.625
Two rib fractures,

18:01.291 --> 18:02.666
left arm radial fracture,

18:02.666 --> 18:04.833
multiple soft tissue contusions.

18:05.291 --> 18:06.083
Yes,

18:06.500 --> 18:07.875
sign here.

18:09.500 --> 18:11.541
You remember it so clearly.

18:12.541 --> 18:14.041
Shanshan, I must apologize

18:14.041 --> 18:15.125
for asking you to come in.

18:15.250 --> 18:16.291
No problem.

18:22.083 --> 18:22.833
Officer Shen,

18:22.916 --> 18:24.208
if that's all, I'll be on my way.

18:24.208 --> 18:25.666
I'm meeting my agent to see apartments.

18:25.833 --> 18:27.458
OK, we're finished here.

18:29.166 --> 18:30.000
Oh, Officer Shen.

18:30.000 --> 18:30.083
Oh, Officer Shen.

18:31.125 --> 18:32.708
Could you get me a visitor's pass?

18:33.875 --> 18:36.291
I want to see her husband's sentencing.

18:37.500 --> 18:38.833
I'll see what I can do.

18:38.958 --> 18:40.041
Thanks.

18:44.833 --> 18:45.916
Walk her out.

18:47.083 --> 18:48.458
Come on, walk her out.

18:49.125 --> 18:49.791
Shanshan,

18:49.791 --> 18:50.750
so you're buying an apartment?

18:50.958 --> 18:52.208
My agent scheduled some viewings.

18:52.708 --> 18:55.750
I actually know of a few good places.

18:55.833 --> 18:56.500
Really?

18:56.625 --> 18:57.500
OK.

18:59.708 --> 19:00.000
What is it?

19:00.000 --> 19:00.500
What is it?

19:00.500 --> 19:01.583
Did you find something?

19:02.791 --> 19:03.458
Officer,

19:03.875 --> 19:05.541
has the killer been found yet?

19:05.916 --> 19:06.583
None of your business.

19:06.625 --> 19:07.250
Sit back down.

19:12.375 --> 19:14.166
But Officer, I know some information.

19:14.375 --> 19:15.583
What do you know?

19:16.416 --> 19:17.250
Tell me.

19:17.666 --> 19:19.083
Well...did this woman

19:19.083 --> 19:21.458
run away from home for awhile before she died?

19:21.458 --> 19:22.833
Please see yourself out.

19:23.208 --> 19:24.208
Don't mind me.

19:25.666 --> 19:28.416
She was staying with the killer.

19:29.083 --> 19:29.875
You witnessed this?

19:34.083 --> 19:36.000
Do you know what you're talking about?

19:39.375 --> 19:40.666
Officer, here's what happened.

19:42.250 --> 19:43.750
I recently went to

19:43.750 --> 19:46.583
the Master of Memory Center to do a memory surgery.

19:46.583 --> 19:48.833
But once I retrieved my memories back,

19:48.833 --> 19:51.750
I can now clearly see this woman's murder.

19:52.083 --> 19:53.791
So bigshot author,

19:53.916 --> 19:56.416
you must know who the killer is then.

19:56.666 --> 19:58.041
I don't know

19:58.250 --> 20:00.000
if you'll understand what I'm saying.

20:00.000 --> 20:00.875
if you'll understand what I'm saying.

20:03.291 --> 20:04.708
In the memories,

20:04.833 --> 20:07.125
I'm the killer.

20:12.291 --> 20:14.250
There's a greenhouse,

20:14.250 --> 20:16.083
I can't tell where it is.

20:17.875 --> 20:19.166
Her face has scars,

20:19.250 --> 20:21.625
but she's not at all scared of the killer.

20:22.041 --> 20:23.875
They seem pretty close.

20:29.083 --> 20:30.000
Can you think of any specific details about the killer?

20:30.000 --> 20:33.458
Can you think of any specific details about the killer?

20:35.541 --> 20:37.166
I only just restored these memories.

20:38.041 --> 20:39.375
It might need some time.

20:39.416 --> 20:41.416
So, you really don't know anything.

20:41.750 --> 20:42.750
What do you expect us to do?

20:42.958 --> 20:44.416
How can you say that?

20:44.708 --> 20:47.791
I can see the killer drown Li Huilan in the bathtub.

20:49.875 --> 20:51.208
You saw that.

20:51.958 --> 20:53.083
I did.

20:54.708 --> 20:55.833
Are you sure?

20:56.833 --> 20:57.916
I saw it with my own eyes.

20:58.083 --> 20:59.375
With your own eyes.

21:00.125 --> 21:01.500
In my memories.

21:02.791 --> 21:03.791
OK bigshot author,

21:04.541 --> 21:06.416
please stop wasting our time.

21:06.583 --> 21:08.625
If you need inspiration, go watch the news.

21:08.875 --> 21:10.291
I'm telling the truth!

21:13.916 --> 21:15.041
Take a break.

21:17.291 --> 21:18.916
Wait for your family to come post bail.

21:19.625 --> 21:21.625
Why won't you believe me?

21:21.750 --> 21:23.541
It's a big greenhouse, should be easy to spot.

21:23.666 --> 21:24.375
OK.

21:25.416 --> 21:26.958
Also there's a number of wood carvings inside.

21:27.125 --> 21:28.833
One is unfinished.

21:31.041 --> 21:34.041
You can investigate Huilan's close friends.

21:34.625 --> 21:35.625
Mr. Jiang,

21:35.625 --> 21:37.625
you really are an excellent storyteller.

21:54.583 --> 21:56.041
Hello, is this the police?

21:57.541 --> 21:58.791
I'm at Seawall Village, Twenty...

21:59.666 --> 22:00.000
Mom, what are you doing?

22:00.000 --> 22:00.583
Mom, what are you doing?

22:00.583 --> 22:01.791
No police.

22:02.208 --> 22:04.625
It'll be too embarassing if this gets out.

22:05.958 --> 22:07.333
Honey!

22:07.791 --> 22:09.875
-Open the door! -Go away, my sister doesn't want to see you.

22:09.875 --> 22:11.125
Honey, I was wrong.

22:11.375 --> 22:12.500
Come back home.

22:13.458 --> 22:14.291
Honey,

22:14.416 --> 22:16.000
I'm holding a knife,

22:16.416 --> 22:17.916
if you don't come out,

22:18.041 --> 22:20.041
I'll chop my own finger off.

22:21.458 --> 22:22.458
Honey!

22:23.708 --> 22:24.583
Honey,

22:26.250 --> 22:26.958
3

22:27.416 --> 22:28.291
2

22:29.083 --> 22:30.000
-Sister, don't go. -1

22:30.000 --> 22:30.166
-Sister, don't go. -1

22:30.166 --> 22:30.833
Sister,

22:37.375 --> 22:38.333
Sister,

22:38.625 --> 22:40.125
Are you sure?

22:45.000 --> 22:45.958
Mom,

22:46.833 --> 22:48.791
I know I've been bad.

22:49.333 --> 22:51.458
I will change.

22:56.625 --> 22:57.541
Mom.

23:01.541 --> 23:02.916
Let's go home,

23:09.166 --> 23:10.541
Why aren't you coming?

23:13.083 --> 23:13.750
Behave yourself.

23:13.750 --> 23:14.416
Let's go.

23:29.541 --> 23:30.000
Please slow down.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.083
Please slow down.

23:33.916 --> 23:34.666
I'm begging you.

23:34.666 --> 23:35.875
I was wrong, I'm sorry.

23:35.916 --> 23:36.625
Let him off the car.

23:36.625 --> 23:38.041
At least let him off the car.

23:38.666 --> 23:39.708
Car! Car!

23:40.541 --> 23:42.500
-Will you listen to me? -I will, I will.

23:42.500 --> 23:43.958
Yes, yes, whatever you say.

24:04.833 --> 24:06.625
You treated me like garbage.

24:06.708 --> 24:08.083
You left me no choice.

24:09.250 --> 24:10.375
No choice!

24:10.500 --> 24:11.541
No choice!

24:11.708 --> 24:13.458
Today, in front of your family,

24:13.500 --> 24:14.708
in front him,

24:14.750 --> 24:16.833
I was kneeling on the ground and you wouldn't even look at me.

24:17.916 --> 24:19.541
Are you happy now?

24:19.666 --> 24:21.083
Happy?

24:24.833 --> 24:25.833
Answer me,

24:27.083 --> 24:29.291
do you dare to leave me again?

24:30.375 --> 24:32.375
Do you dare?

24:32.458 --> 24:33.541
Speak!

24:52.500 --> 24:53.708
Whose file do you want?

24:54.041 --> 24:55.375
Li Huilan.

24:56.250 --> 24:57.291
Sir,

24:57.291 --> 24:59.375
you don't really believe Jiang Feng?

24:59.708 --> 25:00.000
Huilan wasn't even drowned to death.

25:00.000 --> 25:01.708
Huilan wasn't even drowned to death.

25:03.375 --> 25:04.375
Don't forget,

25:04.500 --> 25:07.041
he even assaulted the director of that center.

25:07.041 --> 25:09.666
Maybe that surgery really did mess him up.

25:10.125 --> 25:11.958
Do you consider Jiang a well-known author?

25:11.958 --> 25:12.791
Yes.

25:12.958 --> 25:14.000
Alright.

25:14.125 --> 25:16.958
Then why would a well-known author come to the police

25:16.958 --> 25:18.500
and spread lies?

25:18.500 --> 25:20.666
Publicity, to create some buzz.

25:21.458 --> 25:23.750
Everybody famous does that now.

25:23.875 --> 25:26.583
If not entertainment headlines, they'll try for the front page.

25:26.625 --> 25:27.916
He must be releasing a new book.

25:27.958 --> 25:29.125
When's the new book coming out?

25:29.541 --> 25:30.000
I don't know.

25:30.000 --> 25:30.458
I don't know.

25:30.750 --> 25:32.083
-I'm looking for Officer Shen -I didn't

25:32.083 --> 25:33.625
Sir, excuse me.

25:33.791 --> 25:35.125
Please wait outside a moment.

25:35.333 --> 25:36.416
-Just a minute. -Officer Shen

25:36.416 --> 25:37.500
Officer Shen,

25:37.541 --> 25:39.458
Mr. Jiang wants to see you.

25:40.458 --> 25:42.000
I know.

25:44.916 --> 25:46.000
Give him some.

25:46.000 --> 25:47.083
I know.

25:51.041 --> 25:52.541
According to you,

25:52.541 --> 25:54.625
this person not only killed Li Huilan,

25:54.791 --> 25:57.000
he also killed another woman.

25:57.125 --> 25:59.625
So he's a serial killer.

26:00.791 --> 26:01.791
Yes.

26:02.208 --> 26:05.083
But you said earlier that Huilan was drowned to death.

26:05.541 --> 26:08.166
Now you're saying there were two murders.

26:08.750 --> 26:10.125
Still working on the story's ending?

26:10.125 --> 26:11.875
I'm telling the truth.

26:11.958 --> 26:13.083
What's the phone number?

26:14.000 --> 26:16.833
You should have seen Huilan's home phone number.

26:17.166 --> 26:18.166
What is it?

26:20.583 --> 26:21.875
You can't remember any of it?

26:21.916 --> 26:22.916
Let me think.

26:26.583 --> 26:28.041
9

26:28.250 --> 26:29.833
914

26:30.375 --> 26:31.291
Is that the ending?

26:31.291 --> 26:32.958
I can't be sure.

26:32.958 --> 26:34.583
What day did you have the surgery?

26:34.583 --> 26:35.583
Friday,

26:36.500 --> 26:38.416
it was the day of the shooting.

26:44.250 --> 26:44.750
How about this,

26:44.750 --> 26:45.500
I

26:45.833 --> 26:46.833
I'll go home and think it over.

26:46.958 --> 26:48.500
Once things are clearer, I'll let you know.

26:48.500 --> 26:49.875
Lei, detain him.

26:52.458 --> 26:54.833
I came to provide leads for you.

26:54.833 --> 26:56.916
Do you believe what I'm saying or not?

26:56.916 --> 26:59.125
-Of course not. -I believe you.

26:59.791 --> 27:00.000
That's why I suspect you have a connection with this case.

27:00.000 --> 27:02.291
That's why I suspect you have a connection with this case.

27:02.708 --> 27:04.041
Try to understand.

27:05.500 --> 27:06.625
Sir,

27:06.625 --> 27:08.541
he's clearly talking nonsense.

27:09.125 --> 27:10.500
Why are we keeping him?

27:11.708 --> 27:14.583
Look at Li Huilan's home phone number.

27:17.958 --> 27:19.041
Read it out loud.

27:19.375 --> 27:22.000
0909914

27:22.666 --> 27:23.666
914

27:24.541 --> 27:25.208
Sir,

27:25.500 --> 27:26.958
it's just a coincidence

27:38.958 --> 27:40.625
I'll be damned, somebody's here.

27:41.250 --> 27:43.583
Bro, what brought you here?

27:48.666 --> 27:50.083
First time here?

27:53.625 --> 27:55.083
First time?

27:55.875 --> 27:58.375
Then I should educate you a bit.

27:58.666 --> 28:00.000
What if somebody bullies you next time around?

28:00.000 --> 28:01.375
What if somebody bullies you next time around?

28:01.375 --> 28:02.333
Right?

28:04.208 --> 28:06.041
Do you know what that's for?

28:06.500 --> 28:08.875
Those handcuffs are for drug addicts.

28:09.000 --> 28:10.708
Once they're here, those kids

28:10.791 --> 28:12.750
will do anything to hurt themselves.

28:12.791 --> 28:13.916
All sorts of crazy ideas.

28:13.916 --> 28:15.875
Smashing themselves against the bars,

28:15.875 --> 28:18.000
swallowing rings.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.916
One time I met a woman in South City,

28:19.916 --> 28:21.291
it was unbelievable.

28:21.708 --> 28:24.291
She hid some needles in her hair and swallowed them.

28:24.291 --> 28:25.500
Scared the hell out of the police.

28:26.041 --> 28:27.041
This crappy place

28:27.041 --> 28:28.625
has all kinds of people.

28:29.250 --> 28:30.000
Robbers, prostitutes,

28:30.000 --> 28:31.375
Robbers, prostitutes,

28:31.416 --> 28:32.500
clients of prostitues,

28:32.500 --> 28:34.250
brawlers, arsonists,

28:34.333 --> 28:35.708
thieves, etc.

28:35.958 --> 28:36.958
Bro,

28:36.958 --> 28:40.166
you still haven't told me why you're here.

28:41.708 --> 28:42.666
Assault.

28:43.791 --> 28:45.125
Assault?

28:45.583 --> 28:47.291
Must be you got assaulted.

28:48.375 --> 28:50.083
You're not the type, I have a good sense.

28:50.083 --> 28:51.916
You don't have that look in your eye.

28:53.291 --> 28:54.750
What look?

29:01.875 --> 29:04.208
Have you ever looked into the eyes of a killer?

29:12.833 --> 29:14.083
Ignoring me?

29:14.083 --> 29:16.958
I don't feel like talking to you either, it's too one-sided.

29:20.291 --> 29:21.208
Stop.

29:21.291 --> 29:22.458
Zoom in.

29:26.916 --> 29:28.125
That's Jiang Feng.

29:29.041 --> 29:30.000
Who's that?

29:30.000 --> 29:30.416
Who's that?

29:30.875 --> 29:32.000
Zoom in.

29:33.083 --> 29:34.625
He's picking something up.

29:37.583 --> 29:40.083
It looks that way.

29:42.083 --> 29:43.750
I'll pay the Master of Memory Center a visit.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.125
Call me if there's anything.

29:49.458 --> 29:50.291
Print this.

29:55.250 --> 29:56.166
What are you doing?

29:56.250 --> 29:58.500
I was worried after your call, so I came over.

29:58.916 --> 30:00.000
I'm fine, you should go.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.125
I'm fine, you should go.

30:02.708 --> 30:05.000
Even like this, you still say you're fine?

30:05.000 --> 30:06.416
I said I'm fine.

30:06.416 --> 30:08.833
Just leave me be. Go.

30:09.166 --> 30:11.208
I can't let you go on like this.

30:11.208 --> 30:12.291
Let's go.

30:12.291 --> 30:13.333
Go where?

30:16.416 --> 30:16.958
Quick, get out.

30:17.208 --> 30:18.625
My husband will be back anytime.

30:23.458 --> 30:24.541
It's none of your business.

30:25.125 --> 30:25.958
Just go.

30:25.958 --> 30:26.750
Hurry.

30:32.333 --> 30:32.916
Go!

30:33.500 --> 30:34.291
Open the door!

30:34.708 --> 30:36.250
Open the door!

30:37.625 --> 30:39.791
Bitch, open the door!

30:53.708 --> 30:55.083
Why did you lock the door?

30:55.958 --> 30:57.250
For security.

31:21.416 --> 31:22.666
Who was here?

31:28.583 --> 31:29.833
Stop hitting me.

31:30.375 --> 31:31.625
Stop hitting me.

31:36.833 --> 31:38.833
Where?

31:53.416 --> 31:54.833
I didn't mean it.

32:05.541 --> 32:07.291
Is he still alive?

32:08.791 --> 32:10.333
I didn't mean it.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.125
I didn't mean it.

32:12.125 --> 32:13.625
He's not dead.

32:26.041 --> 32:27.333
Leave him.

32:27.500 --> 32:29.083
Come with me.

32:36.125 --> 32:37.333
I can't leave.

32:39.875 --> 32:42.583
If I go, what about my daughter?

32:54.166 --> 32:55.458
No police.

32:57.500 --> 32:59.333
Last time I left home,

32:59.791 --> 33:00.000
he was questioned by his supervisor.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.416
he was questioned by his supervisor.

33:03.291 --> 33:05.125
If I disappear again,

33:07.083 --> 33:08.375
he'll lose his job.

33:11.375 --> 33:12.666
I'm fine.

33:14.375 --> 33:16.125
It's already been 10 years,

33:17.500 --> 33:19.041
nothing's going to happen.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.583
It's been 10 years

33:24.083 --> 33:25.166
and he hasn't changed.

33:25.208 --> 33:27.125
What can you expect from him?

33:29.708 --> 33:30.000
Don't be like this.

33:30.000 --> 33:30.791
Don't be like this.

33:32.416 --> 33:34.000
It's weird.

33:34.291 --> 33:36.583
He's scum, he'll never cherish you.

33:37.875 --> 33:39.375
Stop saying these things.

33:40.916 --> 33:42.833
Don't you feel it's strange for you to talk like this?

33:46.625 --> 33:48.000
You're scaring me.

33:48.750 --> 33:50.250
Sorry, please leave.

33:55.333 --> 33:56.958
Leave him.

33:57.416 --> 33:58.791
Come with me.

34:04.666 --> 34:06.000
Leave him.

34:06.541 --> 34:07.500
OK?

34:08.541 --> 34:10.333
Stop dreaming.

34:11.333 --> 34:13.250
I'll never loved you.

34:15.041 --> 34:17.458
You make me sick.

36:30.416 --> 36:31.833
You scared me.

36:31.833 --> 36:33.000
You're crying.

36:33.333 --> 36:34.250
Nightmare?

36:34.583 --> 36:35.625
What was it?

36:35.791 --> 36:36.916
Tell me.

36:39.083 --> 36:40.125
Step away from him.

36:40.833 --> 36:42.083
Move aside.

36:42.333 --> 36:43.000
Just caring for him.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.000
Over to the wall.

36:46.416 --> 36:47.583
Officer Lei,

36:48.583 --> 36:49.958
I saw some more things.

36:50.291 --> 36:52.583
I saw the killer push Li Huilan down the stairs.

36:53.000 --> 36:55.708
The strange thing was that afterwards, it seemed like

36:56.083 --> 36:57.958
she couldn't see clearly.

36:58.708 --> 36:59.625
OK.

36:59.625 --> 37:00.000
I'll pass this along.

37:00.000 --> 37:00.708
I'll pass this along.

37:00.708 --> 37:03.041
Do you guys still not believe me?

37:04.291 --> 37:05.250
I have a question.

37:06.250 --> 37:07.208
Is this you?

37:08.041 --> 37:09.541
Picking something up?

37:10.625 --> 37:13.625
That day, I dropped my memory chip's key.

37:13.750 --> 37:15.208
Do you remember this person?

37:20.166 --> 37:20.916
OK

37:21.291 --> 37:22.333
Why?

37:22.458 --> 37:23.833
From the camera footage,

37:23.916 --> 37:25.875
you both were retrieving things at the same time.

37:27.541 --> 37:28.375
Officer,

37:28.583 --> 37:29.416
Officer,

37:29.875 --> 37:30.000
I'm hungry, is there afternoon tea?

37:30.000 --> 37:31.791
I'm hungry, is there afternoon tea?

37:31.833 --> 37:33.625
Want to stick around for a midnight snack?

37:36.208 --> 37:37.750
Officer Lei,

37:39.041 --> 37:40.958
send somebody to protect my wife.

37:41.291 --> 37:41.875
Why?

37:43.083 --> 37:45.750
If the killer now has my memories,

37:45.791 --> 37:47.958
my wife is in grave danger.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.083
Just think,

37:50.083 --> 37:51.250
the other two victims

37:51.250 --> 37:53.333
were both very close with the killer.

37:55.958 --> 37:56.875
Give me a minute.

37:57.583 --> 37:58.166
Officer Lei

37:58.166 --> 37:58.833
Sir

37:58.958 --> 38:00.000
Officer Lei!

38:00.000 --> 38:00.041
Officer Lei!

38:00.625 --> 38:01.875
Sir, how come you're not back?

38:01.958 --> 38:03.208
I'm still at the Master of Memory.

38:03.375 --> 38:04.416
Any new developments?

38:04.416 --> 38:06.333
Jiang Feng thought of some more things.

38:06.333 --> 38:07.875
It really does seem relevant to the case.

38:08.250 --> 38:10.458
He said Huilan couldn't see clearly.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.833
Remember the autopsy report mentioned

38:12.833 --> 38:14.500
that Huilan had severe myopia.

38:14.500 --> 38:15.750
This is a crucial detail.

38:15.833 --> 38:16.791
Come out now,

38:16.791 --> 38:18.375
let's meet at Huilan's house.

38:18.708 --> 38:19.583
OK.

38:22.833 --> 38:23.333
Bro,

38:23.750 --> 38:25.416
you asked him to protect your wife.

38:25.416 --> 38:27.666
Why not just ask him to let us out of here?

38:46.625 --> 38:47.583
Sir,

38:47.750 --> 38:49.875
any relevant evidence has already been collected.

38:50.125 --> 38:51.625
Why are we here?

38:51.833 --> 38:53.791
Then tell me, what evidence is relevant?

38:56.000 --> 38:58.875
Even the most ordinary items at the scene

38:59.000 --> 39:00.000
could have served a specific purpose during the incident.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.708
could have served a specific purpose during the incident.

39:01.875 --> 39:03.083
How many times have I said,

39:03.208 --> 39:06.458
don't label things relevant or not so lightly.

39:06.708 --> 39:07.500
Understood.

39:07.625 --> 39:08.500
You understand what?

39:08.666 --> 39:10.000
What are we here for?

39:11.166 --> 39:12.250
I don't know.

39:12.625 --> 39:14.500
Go look upstairs.

39:55.166 --> 39:55.958
Sir,

39:56.083 --> 39:57.166
look, I found something.

39:57.958 --> 39:58.791
Sir,

40:00.666 --> 40:01.458
Sir, look.

40:01.500 --> 40:02.291
Get out of my way.

40:09.333 --> 40:10.958
Is everything alright?

40:13.958 --> 40:14.958
Lei

40:17.458 --> 40:18.500
Sir

40:49.500 --> 40:51.500
Officers, how many times do I need to be questioned?

40:52.041 --> 40:53.166
I do have a life.

40:54.125 --> 40:54.916
Ms. Zhang,

40:54.916 --> 40:55.875
I apologize.

40:56.250 --> 40:57.625
When we re-examined the testimonies,

40:57.625 --> 40:59.000
we found some issues.

40:59.625 --> 41:00.000
Can we trouble you for a minute?

41:00.000 --> 41:01.041
Can we trouble you for a minute?

41:02.625 --> 41:03.833
According to your statement,

41:03.833 --> 41:06.333
you knocked on Li Xiaoyun's door at

41:06.333 --> 41:08.125
9:01 PM.

41:08.500 --> 41:10.583
Xiaoyun responded that everything was fine.

41:11.500 --> 41:13.625
But according to our police records,

41:13.708 --> 41:17.125
Xiaoyun called the police at 9:03 PM.

41:17.625 --> 41:19.250
That's only a two minute gap.

41:19.291 --> 41:20.791
I'm absolutely certain about it.

41:20.833 --> 41:22.916
I arrived at her house at 9:01 PM.

41:23.083 --> 41:24.833
How can you remember it so precisely?

41:25.125 --> 41:26.375
Simple.

41:26.625 --> 41:29.125
Every night I watch the TV show, "Silent Bird".

41:29.458 --> 41:30.000
That day, I could hear them fighting.

41:30.000 --> 41:31.541
That day, I could hear them fighting.

41:31.750 --> 41:33.916
The show hadn't ended, so I didn't go immediately.

41:34.375 --> 41:36.666
Besides, they fight all the time.

41:36.666 --> 41:37.666
This show,

41:37.791 --> 41:40.958
they play the next episode's trailer at 8:59.

41:41.166 --> 41:42.666
At 9:00, it goes to commercials.

41:42.958 --> 41:44.916
As soon as the trailer ended, I went over.

41:45.583 --> 41:48.208
You can see their door is just a few steps away.

41:48.583 --> 41:50.583
One minute at the most.

41:56.083 --> 41:57.166
That hurts.

41:57.625 --> 42:00.000
When Huilan left home, do you know where she went?

42:00.000 --> 42:00.458
When Huilan left home, do you know where she went?

42:00.625 --> 42:02.291
I don't know.

42:03.000 --> 42:04.166
But during that time,

42:04.166 --> 42:06.750
their daughter went to and from school as usual,

42:06.958 --> 42:08.000
like nothing had happened.

42:08.208 --> 42:10.541
Then Xiaoyun must have known her mom's whereabouts.

42:11.125 --> 42:12.791
I couldn't possibly know that.

42:13.041 --> 42:15.541
But during the time her mom was away,

42:15.666 --> 42:19.083
There were two times that I saw somebody drive her home.

42:19.833 --> 42:20.875
What's strange is that

42:20.875 --> 42:23.375
each time the car stopped far away.

42:23.500 --> 42:25.458
Xiaoyun walked the rest of the way home.

42:27.000 --> 42:28.125
Also,

42:28.500 --> 42:30.000
I once overheard Xiaoyun and her dad arguing.

42:30.000 --> 42:31.625
I once overheard Xiaoyun and her dad arguing.

42:32.083 --> 42:33.375
Li Hang asked Xiaoyun,

42:33.500 --> 42:34.666
do you know where Mom is?

42:35.083 --> 42:36.708
Guess what she said.

42:37.000 --> 42:37.916
What did she say?

42:38.333 --> 42:39.916
That little girl said,

42:40.208 --> 42:41.625
Why do you care?

42:42.083 --> 42:43.416
She'd be better dead

42:43.416 --> 42:45.333
than with you.

43:05.041 --> 43:06.250
Let me ask you something.

43:08.500 --> 43:10.375
I don't know anything, don't bother.

43:11.208 --> 43:15.333
That woman you mentioned, why did she swallow needles?

43:16.583 --> 43:17.750
What do you think?

43:17.875 --> 43:19.291
Medical release.

43:22.250 --> 43:23.750
If you harm yourself,

43:23.750 --> 43:25.166
the police are afraid of you dying.

43:25.166 --> 43:27.125
They'll definitely send you to the hospital.

43:30.291 --> 43:32.166
So, what are you hiding?

43:35.750 --> 43:38.375
I'm not hiding anything.

43:55.875 --> 43:57.458
I can give you money.

43:57.583 --> 43:58.875
I want out.

43:59.125 --> 44:00.000
Sir,

44:00.000 --> 44:00.125
Sir,

44:01.791 --> 44:02.875
wake up.

44:06.291 --> 44:07.375
What time is it?

44:09.041 --> 44:10.666
7:05

44:24.791 --> 44:25.625
Sir,

44:25.958 --> 44:27.833
have you considered getting a new car?

44:35.500 --> 44:36.916
There's tape on there for protection.

44:37.791 --> 44:39.458
Even if it's swallowed, it won't kill you.

44:41.166 --> 44:44.375
You can later vomit or grab it out.

44:45.875 --> 44:48.416
As long as they believe you're not faking it,

44:48.416 --> 44:50.208
they'll definitely send you to the hospital.

44:53.583 --> 44:54.416
Bro,

44:55.041 --> 44:57.250
you haven't told me how much you're paying.

45:10.208 --> 45:12.583
How much money for you to swallow this?

45:13.666 --> 45:14.958
Me?

45:15.958 --> 45:17.625
Are you crazy?

45:20.125 --> 45:20.875
Stop

45:20.875 --> 45:22.000
stop joking around.

45:28.125 --> 45:29.125
Police!

45:38.333 --> 45:39.500
What are you doing?

45:40.000 --> 45:41.708
He swallowed a razor.

45:46.625 --> 45:47.750
Move aside,

45:50.083 --> 45:51.791
Damn it, he swallowed a razor.

45:51.875 --> 45:53.375
Spit it out, spit it out.

45:53.708 --> 45:54.833
What are you doing?

45:57.458 --> 45:58.375
Open the door!

45:58.750 --> 45:59.958
Open it now!

46:00.250 --> 46:01.166
Open the door!

46:14.541 --> 46:15.291
Daichen

46:15.333 --> 46:15.916
Stop him.

46:15.958 --> 46:16.958
Feng

46:17.500 --> 46:18.500
How come you're out?

46:18.833 --> 46:20.125
I'm applying for your bail.

46:20.500 --> 46:21.916
Sorry, you can't leave.

46:22.166 --> 46:23.000
Don't let them go.

46:23.041 --> 46:23.958
Listen to me.

46:24.208 --> 46:26.166
These next few days, beware of any strangers.

46:26.333 --> 46:26.958
What strangers?

46:27.041 --> 46:27.791
What are you talking about?

46:27.791 --> 46:28.416
Jiang Feng.

46:28.416 --> 46:30.000
Let me go, let go me.

46:30.000 --> 46:30.208
Let me go, let go me.

46:30.416 --> 46:32.333
Let him go, I already paid his bail.

46:32.500 --> 46:33.708
You have the wrong person.

46:38.208 --> 46:38.916
-Don't move. -Feng

46:39.708 --> 46:42.666
You're under arrest for assaulting a police officer.

46:43.291 --> 46:44.833
Why are you arresting him again?

46:45.041 --> 46:47.041
I just paid his bail.

46:47.125 --> 46:48.250
Move, don't try anything.

46:48.375 --> 46:49.416
Who are you?

46:49.916 --> 46:50.625
Go.

46:50.750 --> 46:51.875
He's my husband.

46:52.041 --> 46:52.916
Officer,

46:54.250 --> 46:57.166
my husband is normally a very gentle man.

46:58.041 --> 46:59.875
I don't know what's gotten into him recently.

47:00.916 --> 47:02.500
But believe me,

47:02.541 --> 47:04.291
he's not a criminal.

47:07.625 --> 47:09.458
You should get that injury looked at.

47:09.750 --> 47:12.583
Kim, send her to Dr. Chen.

47:12.583 --> 47:14.125
It's just a scratch.

47:14.250 --> 47:15.750
We have our procedures,

47:15.916 --> 47:17.708
as a family member, please understand.

47:25.208 --> 47:27.083
Say, if you had just waited 10 more minutes,

47:27.250 --> 47:29.416
your wife could have bailed you out.

47:32.000 --> 47:33.166
I believe you.

47:33.750 --> 47:35.333
I went to the Master of Memory Center.

47:35.750 --> 47:37.208
They're very uncooperative,

47:37.958 --> 47:39.500
insisting on a warrant.

47:39.500 --> 47:40.875
Here's the thing,

47:41.041 --> 47:43.916
applying for a warrant would take 10-15 days.

47:44.250 --> 47:47.166
So I can't investigate who you swapped memories with.

47:47.166 --> 47:48.041
How's my wife?

47:48.041 --> 47:49.083
You tell me.

47:50.208 --> 47:51.958
You only have 72 hours,

47:52.416 --> 47:53.500
right?

47:54.083 --> 47:55.125
On the bright side,

47:55.250 --> 47:58.041
maybe the killer hasn't noticed the swap.

47:58.458 --> 48:00.000
So we have to stay one step ahead,

48:00.000 --> 48:00.875
So we have to stay one step ahead,

48:01.416 --> 48:02.666
and uncover his identity.

48:02.791 --> 48:04.708
Then go investigate.

48:09.625 --> 48:11.791
Your wife was explaining to me

48:12.208 --> 48:15.666
how kind and gentle of a person you normally are.

48:17.041 --> 48:19.875
Everything you've done today,

48:19.875 --> 48:21.583
is that really you?

48:34.125 --> 48:37.375
Your memories are our only hope for breaking this case.

48:37.458 --> 48:39.166
I need your full cooperation.

48:39.500 --> 48:40.833
Give me more clues

48:40.833 --> 48:42.208
so that I can find the killer.

48:42.208 --> 48:44.458
Only then can you and your wife be safe.

48:44.666 --> 48:46.458
OK, I'll do whatever you say.

48:50.833 --> 48:51.583
Does it hurt?

48:52.000 --> 48:52.833
I'm fine.

48:55.083 --> 48:55.833
Thanks.

48:55.833 --> 48:57.041
You're welcome.

48:57.500 --> 48:59.500
I'm just helping out Officer Shen.

49:00.458 --> 49:01.875
I'm Chen Shanshan.

49:01.875 --> 49:03.416
Just call me Shanshan.

49:04.625 --> 49:05.208
I'm Daichen.

49:05.208 --> 49:06.375
Zhang Daichen.

49:07.083 --> 49:08.750
It's on your medical record.

49:10.583 --> 49:12.500
This is a very deep wound.

49:12.541 --> 49:14.208
Officer Shen told me everything.

49:17.416 --> 49:19.666
My husband didn't do it on purpose.

49:20.708 --> 49:22.208
He didn't mean it.

49:22.208 --> 49:24.041
but you must look after yourself.

49:29.791 --> 49:30.000
Jiang Feng,

49:30.000 --> 49:30.750
Jiang Feng,

49:35.541 --> 49:37.833
don't worry about a thing.

49:38.083 --> 49:39.000
Relax.

49:39.250 --> 49:41.541
Focus on remembering details.

49:44.458 --> 49:48.041
See if you can stay conscious while asleep.

49:52.708 --> 49:54.416
How can I do that?

49:54.583 --> 49:55.791
Try this.

49:56.041 --> 49:57.375
Before you sleep,

49:57.375 --> 49:59.375
keep telling yourself,

49:59.583 --> 50:00.000
I'm dreaming.

50:00.000 --> 50:00.458
I'm dreaming.

50:00.583 --> 50:01.291
I'm dreaming.

50:01.625 --> 50:02.875
It's that simple.

50:03.625 --> 50:05.000
Just relax,

50:05.000 --> 50:06.291
get comfortable.

50:06.708 --> 50:07.625
Sleep.

50:34.166 --> 50:35.583
Who was here?

50:41.541 --> 50:42.750
Who?

50:43.541 --> 50:44.458
Speak.

50:45.041 --> 50:47.041
There really was nobody here.

50:54.041 --> 50:55.125
Sorry,

50:55.833 --> 50:58.208
I really didn't know who to call,

50:58.375 --> 51:00.000
so I called you.

51:00.000 --> 51:00.375
so I called you.

51:06.750 --> 51:08.041
Who was here?

51:11.458 --> 51:12.250
Here,

51:15.625 --> 51:16.791
don't be scared.

52:48.166 --> 52:49.833
Did Dad do this?

52:57.583 --> 52:58.958
Go.

53:08.166 --> 53:10.375
It'll only be trouble if you stay.

53:21.666 --> 53:24.625
I'll wait for you to go before calling the police.

54:12.291 --> 54:14.125
Let her go, let go.

55:45.291 --> 55:46.416
Officer Shen

55:47.833 --> 55:48.833
Officer Shen

55:49.583 --> 55:50.541
Officer Shen

55:54.625 --> 55:55.750
Jiang Feng

55:58.041 --> 55:59.166
Jiang Feng

56:01.291 --> 56:02.291
Jiang Feng

56:04.625 --> 56:05.750
Jiang Feng

56:07.833 --> 56:08.958
Jiang Feng

56:11.166 --> 56:12.291
Jiang Feng

56:22.500 --> 56:23.791
I understand now.

56:24.125 --> 56:26.125
You said certain things appear blurred,

56:26.250 --> 56:27.666
and certain areas you can't enter.

56:27.875 --> 56:29.916
That's because you are in a person's memory.

56:30.291 --> 56:32.708
If he didn't see something, then you can't either.

56:33.000 --> 56:35.875
Places he didn't go, you can't go either.

56:38.666 --> 56:41.541
Tell me, what kind of person would carry white gloves?

56:41.541 --> 56:42.958
There are lots of possibilities.

56:43.125 --> 56:45.708
Then what does the goldfish floating in mid-air represent?

56:46.041 --> 56:48.583
Clearly that's a supernatural occurrence.

56:48.666 --> 56:51.333
It's your memories getting mixed with your dreams.

56:51.375 --> 56:52.250
No.

56:52.583 --> 56:54.416
The doctor told me earlier,

56:54.500 --> 56:55.791
these are memories being restored,

56:55.916 --> 56:57.333
not dreams.

56:58.458 --> 57:00.000
Regarding Xiaoyun and the killer,

57:00.000 --> 57:00.583
Regarding Xiaoyun and the killer,

57:00.583 --> 57:02.458
what's their relationship?

57:04.041 --> 57:05.291
They know each other.

57:05.458 --> 57:08.416
But Xiaoyun didn't see the murder happen.

57:08.708 --> 57:11.166
She believes the killer is there to help her mom.

57:13.250 --> 57:15.208
There's one thing I haven't figured out.

57:15.416 --> 57:18.291
In the memory, I'm so violent towards Huilan,

57:18.291 --> 57:19.583
yet,

57:20.041 --> 57:22.208
the moment she died,

57:22.208 --> 57:24.458
I experienced a very bizarre emotion.

57:24.541 --> 57:25.750
What emotion?

57:27.458 --> 57:28.875
I felt happy for her.

57:36.083 --> 57:37.041
Right, also,

57:37.958 --> 57:40.875
the last call from Huilan's home is to the killer.

57:49.958 --> 57:50.750
Dr. Chen

57:51.291 --> 57:52.666
I brought you some medicine.

57:54.541 --> 57:56.375
This is great for minimizing scars.

57:56.458 --> 57:57.500
For you.

57:58.125 --> 57:59.166
I can't just accept this.

57:59.458 --> 58:00.000
It's OK.

58:00.000 --> 58:00.500
It's OK.

58:01.666 --> 58:03.000
Sorry, please come in.

58:05.750 --> 58:06.791
Take a seat.

58:10.666 --> 58:12.000
Would you like a drink?

58:12.458 --> 58:13.250
Anything's fine.

58:17.375 --> 58:20.291
It's so hot today, and you came all this way to bring me medicine.

58:21.000 --> 58:22.583
You really didn't have to.

58:23.125 --> 58:25.083
It's nothing, it was on the way.

58:26.000 --> 58:29.125
Actually, I wanted to ask you something.

58:30.833 --> 58:31.541
So,

58:31.666 --> 58:33.875
I have a spare concert ticket

58:34.291 --> 58:35.958
and I can't find anybody to come with me.

58:36.291 --> 58:37.666
Would you be interested?

58:42.333 --> 58:43.583
Of course.

58:43.916 --> 58:45.041
But‚

58:46.708 --> 58:47.458
How about this,

58:47.750 --> 58:48.958
I'll leave you my card.

58:49.083 --> 58:50.166
My number is on there.

58:50.750 --> 58:51.958
If you change your plans

58:52.041 --> 58:53.916
or if something happens to your wound,

58:53.916 --> 58:55.041
call me anytime.

58:55.375 --> 58:56.458
OK, thank you.

58:57.125 --> 58:58.125
Then, I'll be on my way.

58:58.250 --> 58:59.666
-I still need to stop by the hospital.

59:07.916 --> 59:08.875
Sir

59:09.208 --> 59:10.375
Not so loud.

59:11.416 --> 59:12.291
Sorry.

59:12.958 --> 59:14.208
Sorry, sorry.

59:15.083 --> 59:16.000
Hello Xiaoyun,

59:16.750 --> 59:19.375
we have some questions, is now a good time?

59:19.875 --> 59:21.833
A police officer is talking to you.

59:27.250 --> 59:28.625
Don't be nervous.

59:28.625 --> 59:30.000
We just want to confirm some details.

59:30.000 --> 59:31.458
We just want to confirm some details.

59:33.708 --> 59:34.916
Xiaoyun,

59:35.208 --> 59:38.333
where did your mom go during the time she left home?

59:39.708 --> 59:41.208
Young lady, don't lie.

59:41.500 --> 59:44.166
How could your mom leave without telling you?

59:44.708 --> 59:47.000
Also, I heard during that time,

59:47.125 --> 59:48.333
somebody was sending you home.

59:48.625 --> 59:49.916
Who was that?

59:51.125 --> 59:52.791
I was riding in a classmate's car.

59:53.625 --> 59:54.458
Classmate.

59:55.000 --> 59:56.500
Then, which classmate?

59:57.041 --> 59:57.958
What's his name?

59:57.958 --> 59:59.125
Bring me to him.

1:00:00.208 --> 1:00:01.166
Mister,

1:00:01.708 --> 1:00:03.416
are you asking these questions

1:00:03.416 --> 1:00:05.208
in an official police capacity?

1:00:05.875 --> 1:00:07.041
Coming here to find me,

1:00:07.041 --> 1:00:08.500
does the station know about this?

1:00:09.083 --> 1:00:10.833
You should be well aware

1:00:11.166 --> 1:00:12.291
that I'm a minor.

1:00:14.000 --> 1:00:15.000
Why the attitude?

1:00:16.750 --> 1:00:18.375
What, you're scaring people.

1:00:18.583 --> 1:00:20.333
I definitely think she's suspicious.

1:00:21.666 --> 1:00:24.083
What do you think about her relationship with her mom?

1:00:24.791 --> 1:00:26.625
I think it's fine.

1:00:28.791 --> 1:00:29.958
Then why do you think

1:00:31.083 --> 1:00:33.708
she's covering up for her mom's killer?

1:00:37.833 --> 1:00:39.041
I know.

1:00:39.375 --> 1:00:41.958
Xiaoyun probably had enough of her parent's bickering.

1:00:42.916 --> 1:00:46.708
So she kills her mom and then frames her dad.

1:00:49.791 --> 1:00:51.125
Lawyer Li

1:00:51.333 --> 1:00:53.125
Yes, yes, I think it's strange too.

1:00:53.166 --> 1:00:54.500
Jiang Feng is not at all

1:00:54.791 --> 1:00:57.041
Yes, there must be a mistake.

1:01:03.750 --> 1:01:05.041
Oh, really?

1:01:05.875 --> 1:01:08.041
That's great, that's a relief to hear.

1:01:15.875 --> 1:01:16.500
Sir,

1:01:17.041 --> 1:01:18.750
I can't figure this out.

1:01:18.916 --> 1:01:21.708
Do you think it's more likely that Xiaoyun's covering up for the killer,

1:01:21.708 --> 1:01:24.000
or that Jiang Feng's brain got messed up?

1:01:27.375 --> 1:01:28.791
He's coming.

1:01:41.125 --> 1:01:42.416
Li Hang,

1:01:43.250 --> 1:01:45.958
we have some more questions about the events that night.

1:01:45.958 --> 1:01:47.583
Your cooperation is appreciated.

1:01:50.833 --> 1:01:52.041
I'm talking to you.

1:01:52.416 --> 1:01:53.583
Look at me.

1:01:57.875 --> 1:01:58.833
Li Hang,

1:01:58.916 --> 1:02:00.000
can you tell us the sequence of events that night?

1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:02.708
can you tell us the sequence of events that night?

1:02:05.791 --> 1:02:07.041
I got drunk,

1:02:07.333 --> 1:02:08.625
I hit her,

1:02:09.666 --> 1:02:11.250
then she died.

1:02:13.250 --> 1:02:14.875
Can you be more specific?

1:02:15.791 --> 1:02:18.875
I've said everything that needs to be said.

1:02:20.541 --> 1:02:21.708
Then say it again.

1:02:22.208 --> 1:02:23.375
I've already pleaded guilty.

1:02:23.375 --> 1:02:26.375
So, you're certain it was you who killed Huilan?

1:02:26.666 --> 1:02:27.708
Otherwise?

1:02:38.083 --> 1:02:41.000
Do you know about your daughter's friends at school?

1:02:48.250 --> 1:02:49.500
During that time,

1:02:49.500 --> 1:02:52.750
did you see somebody drive her back from school?

1:02:56.000 --> 1:02:57.041
Answer.

1:03:00.375 --> 1:03:02.166
She makes her own decisions.

1:03:13.958 --> 1:03:15.791
Did you really kill your wife?

1:03:31.333 --> 1:03:32.916
Does it matter?

1:03:35.666 --> 1:03:37.708
She's already dead.

1:04:25.375 --> 1:04:27.500
Grab me two painkillers.

1:04:42.375 --> 1:04:44.208
Painkillers

1:04:51.958 --> 1:04:54.041
Sleeping pills

1:05:19.041 --> 1:05:20.166
Go.

1:07:15.291 --> 1:07:18.916
This is every recent female domestic about case.

1:07:20.583 --> 1:07:23.250
I don't think she's the type to call the police.

1:07:23.541 --> 1:07:25.583
This is another Li Huilan.

1:07:26.375 --> 1:07:30.000
They don't feel that their husband's violent behavior is a crime.

1:07:30.000 --> 1:07:30.458
They don't feel that their husband's violent behavior is a crime.

1:07:36.958 --> 1:07:37.958
Also,

1:07:38.250 --> 1:07:40.666
their two personalities are very similar,

1:07:41.750 --> 1:07:44.666
but the killer's behavior with them is totally different.

1:07:46.083 --> 1:07:48.541
With one, it's slipping drugs behind her back.

1:07:48.541 --> 1:07:51.791
The other, it's using a weapon and killing face to face.

1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:55.708
Based on the crimes, it doesn't seem like the same person.

1:07:59.958 --> 1:08:00.000
Do you think you have more than one person's memories?

1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:02.750
Do you think you have more than one person's memories?

1:08:03.250 --> 1:08:04.416
Or maybe,

1:08:04.666 --> 1:08:06.291
he has split personality disorder?

1:08:11.125 --> 1:08:12.583
Any information from Xiaoyun?

1:08:13.583 --> 1:08:16.500
She said nobody else was there that night.

1:08:16.625 --> 1:08:17.708
Impossible.

1:08:18.375 --> 1:08:19.500
She's lying.

1:08:20.375 --> 1:08:22.416
Why not just bring her over and let me confront her?

1:08:22.625 --> 1:08:24.666
It's not that easy.

1:08:26.208 --> 1:08:27.625
She's a minor.

1:08:28.375 --> 1:08:30.000
To override her testimony,

1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:30.166
To override her testimony,

1:08:30.208 --> 1:08:32.083
I need to go through her guardian,

1:08:32.333 --> 1:08:34.250
her school's legal representative.

1:08:34.375 --> 1:08:37.208
I'd also have to contact the juvenile protection agency.

1:08:37.208 --> 1:08:38.708
What is this?

1:08:38.708 --> 1:08:41.750
Didn't you say you hadn't found Huilan's last phone call?

1:08:42.916 --> 1:08:44.250
I haven't verified it yet.

1:08:45.041 --> 1:08:47.250
You've clearly found it, why lie to me?

1:08:47.333 --> 1:08:49.000
I have to use my own judgment.

1:08:49.125 --> 1:08:50.625
Whose number is this?

1:08:50.958 --> 1:08:53.416
Can't you just call and figure that out?

1:08:54.000 --> 1:08:55.708
Do I report to you?

1:08:57.625 --> 1:08:58.916
What are you hiding?

1:09:00.125 --> 1:09:02.833
My wife is in danger out there.

1:09:04.333 --> 1:09:05.375
What are you doing?

1:09:06.416 --> 1:09:08.166
Please escort Mr. Jiang back.

1:09:10.083 --> 1:09:11.333
Mr. Jiang, let's go.

1:09:19.416 --> 1:09:21.083
Hello, welcome.

1:09:23.083 --> 1:09:24.000
Hello

1:09:25.041 --> 1:09:25.958
Daichen,

1:09:26.625 --> 1:09:27.291
you came.

1:09:27.791 --> 1:09:28.625
Here's your bag.

1:09:28.625 --> 1:09:29.375
Thank you.

1:09:37.208 --> 1:09:38.000
Officer Lei,

1:09:38.125 --> 1:09:39.791
the hospital called.

1:09:39.791 --> 1:09:42.083
They didn't find a razor in Gu Haibo's stomach.

1:09:42.458 --> 1:09:43.166
Got it.

1:09:43.250 --> 1:09:44.166
Go.

1:09:55.083 --> 1:09:56.500
Shanshan, could I ask a favor?

1:09:56.541 --> 1:09:57.666
You're close with Officer Shen.

1:09:57.708 --> 1:09:59.250
Could you ask him

1:09:59.500 --> 1:10:00.000
when my husband can be released?

1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:01.666
when my husband can be released?

1:10:03.541 --> 1:10:04.500
I'll try.

1:10:05.583 --> 1:10:06.208
Thanks.

1:10:06.208 --> 1:10:07.333
You're welcome.

1:10:13.250 --> 1:10:15.208
Actually, I haven't been to a concert in ages.

1:10:15.500 --> 1:10:16.291
After our marriage,

1:10:16.458 --> 1:10:18.458
I've made fewer new friends.

1:10:18.833 --> 1:10:21.041
You know, I used to be a writer too.

1:10:21.208 --> 1:10:23.208
It's a pity I stopped.

1:10:23.583 --> 1:10:25.500
It would be wonderful if you resumed writing.

1:10:25.791 --> 1:10:26.458
I will.

1:10:26.541 --> 1:10:27.041
Anyways,

1:10:27.041 --> 1:10:28.541
it's never too late to write a book.

1:11:08.958 --> 1:11:09.583
Officer,

1:11:10.083 --> 1:11:11.083
I'd like some water.

1:11:53.541 --> 1:11:55.166
Don't do anything crazy.

1:12:22.666 --> 1:12:23.541
Don't move.

1:12:23.625 --> 1:12:25.166
You'll only make the wound larger.

1:12:25.208 --> 1:12:26.958
I'm giving you a shot of tranquilizer.

1:12:38.416 --> 1:12:39.000
Don't move.

1:12:39.375 --> 1:12:41.125
You have two choices.

1:12:41.333 --> 1:12:43.875
I kill him and you kill me,

1:12:43.916 --> 1:12:46.541
or you put the gun down and everybody lives.

1:12:48.791 --> 1:12:49.541
OK.

1:12:49.958 --> 1:12:51.291
Take it easy.

1:12:52.625 --> 1:12:54.083
I'm putting the gun down.

1:12:57.375 --> 1:12:58.625
Move it further away.

1:13:05.416 --> 1:13:06.041
Is that enough?

1:13:06.041 --> 1:13:08.250
Cuff your hand with his.

1:13:09.583 --> 1:13:10.375
OK.

1:13:17.833 --> 1:13:19.791
Give him the shot of tranquilizer.

1:13:20.750 --> 1:13:21.791
Do it.

1:13:37.208 --> 1:13:37.958
Alright.

1:13:38.416 --> 1:13:40.708
Put the scissors down, OK?

1:13:43.833 --> 1:13:44.500
Freeze!

1:13:46.291 --> 1:13:47.041
Freeze!

1:14:24.666 --> 1:14:25.333
Hello?

1:14:25.541 --> 1:14:26.500
Daichen

1:14:27.458 --> 1:14:28.375
Feng

1:14:28.708 --> 1:14:29.958
What happened to your voice?

1:14:30.916 --> 1:14:31.416
Hello?

1:14:31.750 --> 1:14:32.625
You're out?

1:14:33.083 --> 1:14:34.541
Don't worry about that for now.

1:14:34.583 --> 1:14:35.458
Where are you?

1:14:35.625 --> 1:14:37.250
Wanxiang Concert Hall.

1:14:37.750 --> 1:14:39.000
Who are you with?

1:14:40.625 --> 1:14:42.333
A friend, what's the matter?

1:14:42.750 --> 1:14:43.791
Just stay there.

1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:45.041
Wait for me.

1:14:46.458 --> 1:14:47.416
Hello?

1:14:47.625 --> 1:14:48.708
Hello?

1:14:54.833 --> 1:14:55.875
What is it?

1:14:57.583 --> 1:14:58.625
Nothing.

1:15:21.541 --> 1:15:22.750
What's the status now?

1:15:26.333 --> 1:15:27.958
You're not pursuing Jiang Feng?

1:15:28.083 --> 1:15:29.125
Why are you here?

1:15:29.250 --> 1:15:30.000
Sir,

1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:30.333
Sir,

1:15:30.375 --> 1:15:31.958
I've found a breakthrough.

1:15:32.416 --> 1:15:33.541
What breakthrough?

1:15:34.000 --> 1:15:34.875
I ask you,

1:15:35.583 --> 1:15:38.541
how do you think the killer and the victims are connected?

1:15:39.291 --> 1:15:39.916
Lovers.

1:15:39.916 --> 1:15:40.625
Wrong.

1:15:40.708 --> 1:15:42.625
Actually, let me phrase it differently.

1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:46.125
The killer and the victims' husbands,

1:15:46.125 --> 1:15:47.291
how are they related?

1:15:47.333 --> 1:15:48.208
Love rivals.

1:15:48.250 --> 1:15:49.166
Wrong again.

1:15:50.875 --> 1:15:52.416
OK, let me ask,

1:15:53.208 --> 1:15:54.666
if one day you're married,

1:15:54.750 --> 1:15:55.833
you come home,

1:15:55.958 --> 1:15:58.250
and you discover your wife cheating with somebody,

1:15:58.625 --> 1:15:59.875
What would you do?

1:16:01.958 --> 1:16:02.750
Castrate him.

1:16:02.750 --> 1:16:04.166
What if you couldn't?

1:16:07.791 --> 1:16:08.916
So, I think

1:16:08.916 --> 1:16:11.291
there's another possibility regarding

1:16:11.291 --> 1:16:13.041
the killer and the victims' relationship.

1:16:14.750 --> 1:16:16.416
Best Friend!

1:16:23.833 --> 1:16:24.833
Sir,

1:16:25.875 --> 1:16:28.875
could the killer be a woman?

1:16:33.375 --> 1:16:34.708
I brought you food,

1:16:36.500 --> 1:16:37.000
medicine,

1:16:37.000 --> 1:16:37.583
books,

1:16:37.583 --> 1:16:38.833
-and some clean clothes. -Thanks.

1:16:46.208 --> 1:16:47.500
Grab me two painkillers.

1:16:51.708 --> 1:16:53.250
Who was here?

1:16:58.625 --> 1:16:59.708
Leave him.

1:17:06.333 --> 1:17:07.958
You want me to leave my husband?

1:17:08.333 --> 1:17:09.791
Don't you get it?

1:17:11.625 --> 1:17:13.166
He's scum.

1:17:13.666 --> 1:17:15.458
Stop dreaming.

1:17:16.625 --> 1:17:18.000
I'll never love you.

1:17:20.125 --> 1:17:21.833
You make me sick.

1:17:22.125 --> 1:17:24.083
Medical Gloves?? Doctor.

1:17:40.916 --> 1:17:42.125
Daichen,

1:17:42.125 --> 1:17:43.708
why don't I wait for him with you?

1:17:43.708 --> 1:17:44.791
OK.

1:18:12.833 --> 1:18:13.750
Hello?

1:18:14.791 --> 1:18:15.916
Hello?

1:18:18.458 --> 1:18:19.875
Is everything alright?

1:18:20.333 --> 1:18:22.083
Yes, probably wrong number.

1:18:25.708 --> 1:18:26.625
Daichen,

1:18:26.958 --> 1:18:29.625
I'll introduce you to a great doctor at our hospital.

1:18:30.708 --> 1:18:31.291
Feng

1:18:31.375 --> 1:18:32.250
Let's go.

1:18:32.625 --> 1:18:33.625
This is Shanshan.

1:18:33.625 --> 1:18:34.583
Sorry.

1:18:35.833 --> 1:18:36.458
Daichen

1:18:36.750 --> 1:18:37.750
Shanshan, I'll call you later.

1:18:38.000 --> 1:18:39.333
Let's go, don't say anything.

1:18:39.333 --> 1:18:40.458
What are you doing?

1:18:41.333 --> 1:18:42.500
Where are we going?

1:18:43.583 --> 1:18:44.583
Let's go.

1:18:49.375 --> 1:18:51.458
Where are you going? The exit's not here.

1:18:51.458 --> 1:18:53.000
Didn't I tell you not to say anything?

1:18:54.250 --> 1:18:55.791
What's with your attitude?

1:18:56.166 --> 1:18:57.791
Where on earth are you going?

1:18:58.458 --> 1:18:59.875
Let me go.

1:19:00.500 --> 1:19:01.583
Let's go.

1:19:07.875 --> 1:19:09.375
Why did you call me?

1:19:10.583 --> 1:19:12.083
How do you have my phone number?

1:19:12.625 --> 1:19:14.583
Can somebody tell me what's going on?

1:19:16.333 --> 1:19:19.083
You're hurting me, let go.

1:19:19.500 --> 1:19:20.583
Jiang Feng,

1:19:21.041 --> 1:19:22.458
you're scaring me.

1:19:24.458 --> 1:19:25.166
Jiang Feng

1:19:25.166 --> 1:19:26.916
Can't you see she doesn't want to go with you?

1:19:26.916 --> 1:19:28.541
Stop or I'll call the police.

1:19:29.583 --> 1:19:30.000
Jiang Feng,

1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:30.333
Jiang Feng,

1:19:30.625 --> 1:19:31.916
Jiang Feng, stop.

1:19:32.458 --> 1:19:33.625
Jiang Feng, let go of me.

1:19:33.625 --> 1:19:35.041
Stay away from her.

1:19:35.458 --> 1:19:37.166
Let go of me.

1:19:40.333 --> 1:19:40.958
Are you OK?

1:19:40.958 --> 1:19:43.791
I'm your husband, why don't you believe me?

1:19:46.041 --> 1:19:48.625
How can I believe you when you're acting like this?

1:19:48.625 --> 1:19:50.291
What's going on with that phone call?

1:19:50.458 --> 1:19:51.958
What on earth are you hiding?

1:19:52.208 --> 1:19:52.791
Daichen

1:19:52.791 --> 1:19:55.541
Please leave, I'm going to call the police.

1:19:57.750 --> 1:19:58.833
What are you doing?

1:20:03.958 --> 1:20:04.875
Ladies,

1:20:04.875 --> 1:20:06.666
is this man bothering you?

1:20:07.375 --> 1:20:08.250
This is my wife,

1:20:08.250 --> 1:20:09.666
it's a personal matter.

1:20:10.500 --> 1:20:11.625
Is that so?

1:20:15.125 --> 1:20:16.375
He has a knife.

1:20:18.208 --> 1:20:19.375
What's in your pocket?

1:20:19.625 --> 1:20:20.916
Show me your hands.

1:20:20.916 --> 1:20:22.083
Show them.

1:20:24.500 --> 1:20:25.666
Let go.

1:20:25.875 --> 1:20:27.041
Let go of me.

1:20:30.250 --> 1:20:31.416
Call the police.

1:20:32.458 --> 1:20:34.166
Let go of me.

1:20:44.416 --> 1:20:45.375
Officer Lei,

1:20:47.291 --> 1:20:49.041
when can Jiang Feng leave?

1:20:49.958 --> 1:20:51.375
You think it's my decision?

1:20:52.000 --> 1:20:53.375
Just go home and wait.

1:20:56.041 --> 1:20:57.500
Roughly how long?

1:20:57.958 --> 1:20:59.708
He's not leaving tonight.

1:21:08.791 --> 1:21:10.083
It shouldn't be too long.

1:21:10.083 --> 1:21:11.666
Go back home and rest.

1:21:12.291 --> 1:21:13.291
Go home.

1:21:28.708 --> 1:21:29.500
Daichen,

1:21:30.000 --> 1:21:31.250
don't worry.

1:21:31.750 --> 1:21:32.500
Look,

1:21:32.500 --> 1:21:33.458
I didn't get hurt,

1:21:33.958 --> 1:21:35.250
and I'm not pressing charges.

1:21:35.708 --> 1:21:37.500
He'll be out in a few days.

1:21:38.333 --> 1:21:39.083
Thanks.

1:21:39.750 --> 1:21:41.916
Why don't we browse the flower market tomorrow?

1:21:42.166 --> 1:21:43.333
Get your mind off this.

1:21:49.291 --> 1:21:50.000
That's alright.

1:21:50.833 --> 1:21:52.250
With so much going on,

1:21:52.416 --> 1:21:53.833
I'm not in the mood.

1:22:02.000 --> 1:22:03.291
You're out of control.

1:22:03.750 --> 1:22:04.916
You're being too reckless.

1:22:04.916 --> 1:22:06.666
Why cover up for Chen Shanshan?

1:22:07.500 --> 1:22:10.500
I can't find any direct evidence that implicates her.

1:22:10.875 --> 1:22:12.791
Just wait for my memory to come back,

1:22:12.791 --> 1:22:15.208
I'll definitely find something that proves it's her.

1:22:18.250 --> 1:22:19.666
If we wait until then,

1:22:19.750 --> 1:22:23.166
I worry that these memories will be permanently with you.

1:22:24.166 --> 1:22:24.625
Is it worth it?

1:22:24.625 --> 1:22:26.916
Is letting the killer go unpunished worth it?

1:22:27.875 --> 1:22:30.000
Is having my wife and I live in constant fear worth it?

1:22:30.000 --> 1:22:30.625
Is having my wife and I live in constant fear worth it?

1:22:40.875 --> 1:22:42.083
Jiang Feng,

1:22:43.583 --> 1:22:45.958
for the sake of catching a monster,

1:22:46.458 --> 1:22:48.666
we can't risk creating another one.

1:23:02.041 --> 1:23:04.416
The look in my wife's eyes today,

1:23:06.166 --> 1:23:08.500
it was like she was staring at a monster.

1:23:42.708 --> 1:23:45.458
To Jiang Feng.

1:23:54.333 --> 1:23:57.583
Because I'm undergoing memory surgery,

1:23:57.583 --> 1:23:58.541
so,

1:23:59.125 --> 1:24:00.000
I don't know what I'll be like after.

1:24:00.000 --> 1:24:00.708
I don't know what I'll be like after.

1:24:00.958 --> 1:24:01.833
I'm leaving a

1:24:02.458 --> 1:24:04.083
I'm leaving a record, a backup.

1:24:06.875 --> 1:24:08.208
This place is

1:24:10.708 --> 1:24:13.500
where you met Daichen for the first time.

1:24:15.750 --> 1:24:17.375
I remember it was a windy day,

1:24:17.708 --> 1:24:19.458
the wind sent my manuscript flying.

1:24:19.458 --> 1:24:22.333
Then, she was standing there

1:24:22.708 --> 1:24:24.958
and couldn't stop smiling at me.

1:24:27.458 --> 1:24:30.000
Are you two paying cash or getting a mortgage?

1:24:30.000 --> 1:24:31.083
Are you two paying cash or getting a mortgage?

1:24:32.375 --> 1:24:33.291
Mortgage.

1:24:33.916 --> 1:24:35.500
May I ask your occupations?

1:24:35.666 --> 1:24:36.583
Writers.

1:24:36.583 --> 1:24:38.541
He writes novels, I write travel books.

1:24:38.708 --> 1:24:40.000
"Midnight Rain", have you heard of it?

1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:41.041
He wrote it.

1:24:43.125 --> 1:24:45.791
After so many years writing, I've finally won this award.

1:24:46.208 --> 1:24:47.166
I'm so happy.

1:24:47.500 --> 1:24:49.125
I'd like to thank my wife, Zhang Daichen.

1:24:50.000 --> 1:24:51.500
She's done so much for me.

1:24:51.916 --> 1:24:53.541
Without her, I wouldn't be here today.

1:24:53.583 --> 1:24:55.708
So this award is yours too.

1:24:55.958 --> 1:24:57.375
Again, thank you everybody. Thank you.

1:24:57.375 --> 1:24:58.083
Daichen,

1:24:58.625 --> 1:25:00.000
thank you for taking care of Feng.

1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:00.458
thank you for taking care of Feng.

1:25:00.708 --> 1:25:02.208
Mother, you're too polite.

1:25:02.333 --> 1:25:03.416
It's my duty.

1:25:04.833 --> 1:25:06.291
I don't mean to intrude,

1:25:06.833 --> 1:25:08.250
regarding children,

1:25:08.625 --> 1:25:11.250
men can wait, but women really can not.

1:25:12.208 --> 1:25:15.833
Any later will be considered late-stage birth.

1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:17.791
Then it could be very dangerous.

1:25:18.416 --> 1:25:19.833
-I don't mean to frighten you. -Daichen,

1:25:19.875 --> 1:25:23.416
Louis said his company is publishing some travel books next year.

1:25:24.041 --> 1:25:25.375
Want to give it a shot?

1:25:27.125 --> 1:25:28.833
It's been years since I've last written.

1:25:28.833 --> 1:25:29.666
I can't do it.

1:25:29.833 --> 1:25:30.000
How about this,

1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:30.500
How about this,

1:25:30.500 --> 1:25:32.041
I have a good friend, Ada.

1:25:32.208 --> 1:25:34.083
She also writes in this genre.

1:25:34.416 --> 1:25:35.875
Very talented.

1:25:35.875 --> 1:25:37.833
How about I introduce you two?

1:25:38.666 --> 1:25:39.625
Sure.

1:25:41.833 --> 1:25:43.625
Don't worry.

1:25:44.083 --> 1:25:46.500
The fertility issues could stem from her physical condition.

1:25:46.958 --> 1:25:49.291
I'll give you another medicine to try.

1:25:53.958 --> 1:25:55.541
Do you know

1:25:57.208 --> 1:25:59.250
how much medicine I take everyday?

1:25:59.958 --> 1:26:00.000
How many injections?

1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:01.666
How many injections?

1:26:07.500 --> 1:26:09.291
You don't know, do you?

1:26:12.125 --> 1:26:14.041
Because everyday around this time,

1:26:14.375 --> 1:26:17.791
I get up myself to take the medicine and injections.

1:26:21.333 --> 1:26:22.416
I know, I know.

1:26:22.666 --> 1:26:23.958
What do you know?

1:26:24.791 --> 1:26:26.666
Besides, it's not you who has to suffer.

1:26:26.666 --> 1:26:27.291
Then

1:26:27.625 --> 1:26:29.958
then let's not suffer anymore.

1:26:31.375 --> 1:26:32.833
Let's forget about it, OK?

1:26:56.791 --> 1:26:57.916
Still up?

1:27:00.416 --> 1:27:02.375
Do you remember one year,

1:27:02.708 --> 1:27:05.291
Ada and I went to India?

1:27:08.375 --> 1:27:09.833
She wrote a book.

1:27:10.458 --> 1:27:11.208
Look.

1:27:11.250 --> 1:27:12.416
Look.

1:27:12.958 --> 1:27:17.250
New Age Publishers bestseller.

1:27:17.250 --> 1:27:20.500
Oriental Post, travel book of the year.

1:27:21.541 --> 1:27:23.333
So great.

1:27:27.875 --> 1:27:29.958
What are you doing? Why aren't you talking?

1:27:30.041 --> 1:27:31.833
Am I interrupting your writing?

1:27:32.166 --> 1:27:32.958
Then again,

1:27:33.250 --> 1:27:35.041
if you weren't writing books,

1:27:35.333 --> 1:27:37.916
how could we afford such a beautiful apartment?

1:27:38.416 --> 1:27:40.875
Everybody says I'm so blessed.

1:27:48.750 --> 1:27:49.916
Tell me,

1:27:53.958 --> 1:27:56.291
if I wrote this book

1:28:02.833 --> 1:28:05.041
would I do worse than her?

1:28:15.583 --> 1:28:17.291
Talk to me.

1:28:25.083 --> 1:28:26.791
Stop looking at that.

1:28:29.875 --> 1:28:30.000
I'm asking you,

1:28:30.000 --> 1:28:31.625
I'm asking you,

1:28:33.166 --> 1:28:35.875
if I didn't marry you back then,

1:28:40.208 --> 1:28:43.166
what would I be like now?

1:29:21.416 --> 1:29:23.750
The face isn't so wide,

1:29:23.750 --> 1:29:25.125
it should be thinner.

1:29:26.416 --> 1:29:28.625
There's a mole on the side of her face, here.

1:29:34.375 --> 1:29:35.750
I won't go with you.

1:29:36.458 --> 1:29:38.083
Here are your personal belongings.

1:29:38.333 --> 1:29:40.375
Call me if anything happens.

1:29:42.875 --> 1:29:43.958
Be careful.

1:29:51.916 --> 1:29:52.791
Daichen,

1:29:53.083 --> 1:29:54.625
you changed your mind?

1:29:55.541 --> 1:29:56.666
-Come back soon. -Thanks.

1:29:57.291 --> 1:29:58.916
Officer Shen gave me a call this morning.

1:29:59.041 --> 1:30:00.000
Jiang Feng will be out this afternoon.

1:30:00.000 --> 1:30:00.541
Jiang Feng will be out this afternoon.

1:30:00.541 --> 1:30:01.333
So,

1:30:01.916 --> 1:30:04.875
I wanted to pick out some flowers to decorate the house.

1:30:09.416 --> 1:30:10.458
Daichen,

1:30:10.916 --> 1:30:14.041
your husband is involved in that domestic violence case, you know?

1:30:14.750 --> 1:30:16.625
I heard a bit about that.

1:30:18.000 --> 1:30:21.416
I was the first to report Huilan's case to the police.

1:30:22.041 --> 1:30:23.708
I wanted to help her so badly,

1:30:24.041 --> 1:30:26.333
but in the end, I had to respect her own wishes.

1:30:27.500 --> 1:30:28.416
Who could have known,

1:30:28.958 --> 1:30:30.000
the next time I saw her, she was dead.

1:30:30.000 --> 1:30:32.541
the next time I saw her, she was dead.

1:30:34.250 --> 1:30:35.875
So I told myself,

1:30:36.666 --> 1:30:40.375
if I'm going to save somebody, I'll see it to the end.

1:30:40.583 --> 1:30:42.833
Even if it's beyond my professional duties.

1:30:43.208 --> 1:30:44.916
As long as I can help,

1:30:45.458 --> 1:30:46.833
I'll do anything I can.

1:30:47.041 --> 1:30:47.875
Daichen,

1:30:48.166 --> 1:30:49.083
don't blame me.

1:30:49.083 --> 1:30:50.125
Shanshan,

1:30:51.166 --> 1:30:52.250
actually

1:30:52.458 --> 1:30:53.958
my husband these past few days,

1:30:54.125 --> 1:30:56.250
even I have trouble recognizing him.

1:30:57.583 --> 1:30:59.083
But you must believe me,

1:31:01.375 --> 1:31:03.583
he really is a good person.

1:31:06.833 --> 1:31:09.166
Huilan used to tell me the same thing.

1:31:11.416 --> 1:31:12.583
Oh right, Daichen.

1:31:12.875 --> 1:31:14.916
My old family home is nearby,

1:31:14.958 --> 1:31:16.625
I need to get something, want to come?

1:31:17.333 --> 1:31:18.041
OK.

1:31:18.208 --> 1:31:19.208
-Let's go. -OK.

1:31:26.916 --> 1:31:27.500
Come in.

1:31:28.500 --> 1:31:29.125
Careful.

1:31:29.250 --> 1:31:30.000
Thanks.

1:31:33.208 --> 1:31:34.625
This is where you grew up?

1:31:34.791 --> 1:31:36.708
It looks like nobody has lived here for awhile.

1:31:48.250 --> 1:31:48.833
Daichen,

1:31:50.000 --> 1:31:51.208
have a look at the backyard.

1:31:51.333 --> 1:31:52.416
Ah, I'm coming.

1:32:13.916 --> 1:32:14.708
Mr. Jiang,

1:32:14.791 --> 1:32:16.125
we can begin.

1:32:41.916 --> 1:32:43.041
Go.

1:32:50.500 --> 1:32:52.333
This isn't so scary now, right?

1:32:53.916 --> 1:32:56.041
Do you still dare to leave me?

1:32:59.541 --> 1:33:00.000
Wait.

1:33:00.000 --> 1:33:00.583
Wait.

1:33:02.625 --> 1:33:03.958
Mr. Jiang, what is it?

1:33:09.916 --> 1:33:10.750
Jiang Feng, what are you doing?

1:33:10.750 --> 1:33:11.750
Officer Lei,

1:33:12.875 --> 1:33:14.916
One of the victims

1:33:14.916 --> 1:33:16.250
is the killer's mother.

1:33:18.375 --> 1:33:20.416
I was seeing a memory from many years ago,

1:33:20.500 --> 1:33:21.750
from when the killer was just a child.

1:33:21.750 --> 1:33:22.291
OK,

1:33:22.291 --> 1:33:23.250
I'll let Shen know immediately.

1:33:34.291 --> 1:33:35.166
Hello, Feng.

1:33:35.291 --> 1:33:36.958
Hello, Daichen, where are you?

1:33:38.541 --> 1:33:40.416
I'm at Shanshan's house.

1:33:40.666 --> 1:33:41.750
Why did you go there?

1:33:43.166 --> 1:33:44.791
She's showing me her family's greenhouse.

1:33:45.375 --> 1:33:46.291
Greenhouse.

1:33:46.750 --> 1:33:47.916
Quick, get out of there.

1:33:49.375 --> 1:33:50.958
Hello?

1:33:55.708 --> 1:33:57.083
Jiang Feng and I are coming to find you.

1:33:59.208 --> 1:34:00.000
OK.

1:34:00.000 --> 1:34:00.166
OK.

1:34:00.166 --> 1:34:02.375
OK, I'll tell Jiang Feng.

1:34:06.541 --> 1:34:07.416
Daichen,

1:34:07.541 --> 1:34:08.750
please trust me.

1:34:08.875 --> 1:34:10.666
I have my reasons for doing this.

1:34:16.375 --> 1:34:17.416
Sir, where to?

1:34:17.875 --> 1:34:18.916
Get out, this is mine.

1:34:19.000 --> 1:34:20.666
Sir, where are you going?

1:34:22.416 --> 1:34:24.416
I'm at Seawall Village, #28. I'd like...

1:34:25.166 --> 1:34:26.666
-Seawall Village -Can you get out?

1:34:27.125 --> 1:34:28.416
Seawall Village, #28.

1:34:29.666 --> 1:34:30.000
Xiaoyun,

1:34:30.000 --> 1:34:30.500
Xiaoyun,

1:34:30.500 --> 1:34:32.000
your aunt's coming to pick you up.

1:34:32.250 --> 1:34:33.250
I told her,

1:34:33.375 --> 1:34:35.916
I'll send you to and from school these next few days.

1:34:35.916 --> 1:34:37.041
OK?

1:34:38.500 --> 1:34:39.208
Right,

1:34:39.666 --> 1:34:40.791
let me ask you something.

1:34:41.166 --> 1:34:43.916
Just who was at your home that night?

1:34:46.208 --> 1:34:46.625
Uncle,

1:34:46.625 --> 1:34:47.375
Where is Shen Hanqiang?

1:34:47.375 --> 1:34:48.125
Not here.

1:34:48.333 --> 1:34:50.041
I need money from him, I'm out.

1:34:50.625 --> 1:34:51.625
I'll lend you some.

1:34:51.625 --> 1:34:52.625
OK.

1:34:56.458 --> 1:34:57.416
Xiaoyun,

1:34:58.166 --> 1:34:59.291
have you ridden this car before?

1:35:10.166 --> 1:35:11.250
Xiaoyun,

1:35:11.500 --> 1:35:12.583
can you tell me

1:35:13.125 --> 1:35:14.500
just who you're covering up for?

1:35:16.500 --> 1:35:17.541
Lei,

1:35:19.625 --> 1:35:21.625
where'd you get this picture?

1:36:04.166 --> 1:36:05.208
Where's my wife?

1:36:06.333 --> 1:36:07.083
Jiang Feng,

1:36:07.583 --> 1:36:08.958
you must remain calm.

1:36:09.666 --> 1:36:11.958
What you're about to see, don't overreact.

1:36:13.666 --> 1:36:15.083
Tell me, where is my wife?

1:36:15.916 --> 1:36:16.833
Jiang Feng,

1:36:18.083 --> 1:36:19.291
you were right.

1:36:19.916 --> 1:36:21.125
Chen Shanshan is the killer.

1:36:23.208 --> 1:36:25.583
But I never believed she would attack a pregnant woman.

1:36:28.375 --> 1:36:29.541
What do you mean pregnant?

1:36:30.041 --> 1:36:31.666
You don't know that your wife is pregnant?

1:36:32.166 --> 1:36:33.791
Can you wait a moment?

1:36:34.208 --> 1:36:35.291
There's something I want to tell you.

1:36:36.083 --> 1:36:36.791
Jiang Feng,

1:36:37.041 --> 1:36:38.458
Jiang Feng, you must stay calm.

1:36:38.458 --> 1:36:40.041
If you don't get your memories back,

1:36:40.500 --> 1:36:41.666
I'm not signing this.

1:36:42.500 --> 1:36:43.500
Jiang Feng,

1:36:44.791 --> 1:36:46.000
listen to me,

1:36:47.708 --> 1:36:48.916
your wife's death,

1:36:49.083 --> 1:36:51.000
Shanshan will pay the price for this.

1:36:51.833 --> 1:36:53.000
Take it easy.

1:37:05.000 --> 1:37:05.916
Price.

1:37:07.541 --> 1:37:08.958
What price?

1:37:11.083 --> 1:37:12.791
A 10 year sentence?

1:37:14.500 --> 1:37:16.458
20 years, life?

1:37:19.125 --> 1:37:20.291
Jiang Feng,

1:37:20.500 --> 1:37:23.041
I know for the sake of pregnancy,

1:37:23.916 --> 1:37:25.333
you two have suffered so much.

1:37:28.583 --> 1:37:29.833
But she's already gone.

1:37:30.041 --> 1:37:32.083
Is there any meaning if you do this?

1:37:41.500 --> 1:37:43.000
How do you know what we suffered through?

1:37:51.125 --> 1:37:52.083
Who is that?

1:37:53.458 --> 1:37:55.000
I'll pay the Master of Memory Center a visit.

1:38:03.375 --> 1:38:04.458
Minor.

1:38:04.916 --> 1:38:05.416
Hello?

1:38:07.166 --> 1:38:09.958
We can't let another Li Huilan happen.

1:38:09.958 --> 1:38:12.291
Can you go hide out with Daichen for now?

1:40:01.833 --> 1:40:02.750
What is it?

1:40:04.166 --> 1:40:05.125
Let me see.

1:40:09.083 --> 1:40:10.791
Why won't you divorce him?

1:40:12.208 --> 1:40:13.583
You wouldn't understand.

1:40:13.916 --> 1:40:16.583
I can't stand to see him hit you again.

1:40:25.500 --> 1:40:27.166
At least I still have you.

1:40:29.541 --> 1:40:30.000
Too bad he's not dead.

1:40:30.000 --> 1:40:31.625
Too bad he's not dead.

1:40:40.333 --> 1:40:42.166
Don't say things like that.

1:40:46.916 --> 1:40:48.250
I'm sorry.

1:40:50.666 --> 1:40:52.666
I don't want to see him beat you anymore.

1:41:17.208 --> 1:41:18.166
Daichen,

1:41:18.166 --> 1:41:19.458
Daichen, he's awake.

1:41:23.166 --> 1:41:25.083
Feng,

1:41:27.791 --> 1:41:29.208
Easy now.

1:41:33.208 --> 1:41:34.083
Feng

1:41:34.833 --> 1:41:36.208
Daichen, you're OK.

1:41:49.500 --> 1:41:52.041
Ever since I woke up, he's been standing there.

1:42:04.041 --> 1:42:05.041
Don't be afraid.

1:42:19.416 --> 1:42:21.041
So close.

1:42:21.833 --> 1:42:24.541
If he had fired the gun, it'd all be over.

1:42:26.958 --> 1:42:28.833
So close.

1:42:32.208 --> 1:42:34.916
I never meant to cause you and your child trouble.

1:42:36.541 --> 1:42:39.166
I know for the sake of pregnancy,

1:42:39.166 --> 1:42:41.916
how much medicine, how many injections you took.

1:42:42.458 --> 1:42:43.708
Now it's done.

1:42:45.250 --> 1:42:46.333
Finally, you've succeeded.

1:42:46.333 --> 1:42:47.583
Shut up.

1:42:48.125 --> 1:42:49.083
Feng,

1:42:49.333 --> 1:42:50.291
Feng,

1:42:50.291 --> 1:42:51.708
Feng, are you OK?

1:42:54.208 --> 1:42:54.791
Shanshan!

1:42:54.958 --> 1:42:55.625
Shanshan!

1:42:56.250 --> 1:42:59.083
-Shanshan! -The plan was for

1:42:59.083 --> 1:43:00.000
Chen Shanshan to kill your wife,

1:43:00.000 --> 1:43:01.083
Chen Shanshan to kill your wife,

1:43:01.375 --> 1:43:02.916
you'd take my gun

1:43:03.583 --> 1:43:04.833
and kill Chen Shanshan.

1:43:05.416 --> 1:43:06.833
To stop you,

1:43:07.000 --> 1:43:08.083
I'd accidentally kill you.

1:43:08.083 --> 1:43:10.125
You see, it was the only way.

1:43:10.750 --> 1:43:12.125
You monster.

1:43:12.875 --> 1:43:13.916
-Daichen -Shen Hanqiang

1:43:18.958 --> 1:43:19.916
You want to kill him,

1:43:21.250 --> 1:43:22.583
you'll have to kill me first.

1:43:25.458 --> 1:43:26.291
Get out of the way.

1:43:32.250 --> 1:43:35.166
If you really have my husband's memories,

1:43:39.875 --> 1:43:42.000
you won't shoot.

1:43:49.000 --> 1:43:51.166
You really think I won't do it?

1:44:18.708 --> 1:44:21.500
If I didn't marry you back then,

1:44:25.916 --> 1:44:28.500
what would I be like now?

1:44:30.708 --> 1:44:34.000
Actually, I know how much you've sacrified for me.

1:44:37.416 --> 1:44:40.166
It's not that I don't want children,

1:44:43.583 --> 1:44:47.083
I just don't want to see you suffer anymore.

1:44:57.500 --> 1:44:58.958
Come with me, OK?

1:44:59.375 --> 1:45:00.000
Stop dreaming.

1:45:00.000 --> 1:45:01.125
Stop dreaming.

1:45:02.500 --> 1:45:04.416
I'll never love you.

1:45:06.708 --> 1:45:09.041
You make me sick.

1:45:16.333 --> 1:45:17.250
Sir,

1:45:18.833 --> 1:45:22.041
please put your hands where I can see them.

1:45:45.541 --> 1:45:46.708
Sir,

1:45:47.958 --> 1:45:49.750
it's all over.

1:46:34.583 --> 1:46:36.041
What? Why are you awake?

1:46:36.041 --> 1:46:36.916
Easy, easy.

1:46:37.541 --> 1:46:38.250
Easy.

1:46:39.083 --> 1:46:39.958
Does it hurt?

1:46:50.625 --> 1:46:52.041
Thank you.

1:46:54.083 --> 1:46:55.500
Why are you thanking me?

1:47:05.333 --> 1:47:06.416
I'm sorry.

1:47:09.083 --> 1:47:12.875
I don't think I'll be able to get our memories back.

1:47:22.541 --> 1:47:23.791
Nice to meet you.

1:47:25.458 --> 1:47:27.000
I'm Zhang Daichen,

1:47:28.875 --> 1:47:30.000
your wife.

1:47:30.000 --> 1:47:30.375
your wife.

1:47:32.041 --> 1:47:33.666
Nice to meet you.

1:47:36.000 --> 1:47:36.625
I don't understand.

1:47:36.625 --> 1:47:37.791
Say it again.

1:47:38.791 --> 1:47:40.416
Really? English?
