WEBVTT

00:05.005 --> 00:10.051
The Empire has doubled
our work quotas and cut our rations.

00:10.344 --> 00:14.430
Without your food drop,
the weakest among us will starve.

00:14.598 --> 00:16.849
Stay strong, my friend.
We'll be there soon.

00:16.934 --> 00:19.602
You have our deepest gratitude,
Phoenix Squadron.

00:26.402 --> 00:29.904
Our underground network is standing
by at the drop zone to distribute...

00:29.988 --> 00:31.614
The transmission is being jammed.

00:32.908 --> 00:34.992
Looks like the Empire
came out to welcome us.

00:38.455 --> 00:43.084
Attention, rebel convoy.
This system is under Imperial control.

00:43.168 --> 00:46.129
Stand down or be destroyed.

00:46.213 --> 00:48.423
What a surprise. Agent Kallus.

00:48.507 --> 00:50.550
I'll give him this, he's persistent.

00:50.634 --> 00:52.218
Phoenix Leader, your pilots ready?

00:52.386 --> 00:54.595
As ready as we'll ever be,
Captain Syndulla.

00:54.680 --> 00:56.848
All fighters, attack formation.

00:59.643 --> 01:01.144
Deploying fighters.

01:05.941 --> 01:07.650
Just handle those TIEs,
Phoenix Leader.

01:07.735 --> 01:09.736
We'll cover you, Ghost. Start your run.

01:12.823 --> 01:14.907
Zeb, bandit at 270.

01:15.909 --> 01:18.077
I see him. Karabast!

01:18.162 --> 01:20.037
Ezra, coming in at point three.

01:22.791 --> 01:24.834
Kanan, two marks at 185.

01:33.677 --> 01:35.928
This is Transport 1.
We're taking heavy fire!

01:36.013 --> 01:38.181
Stay on course, Transport 1.

01:38.348 --> 01:40.933
Concentrate your fire on that transport.

01:41.018 --> 01:43.269
That cargo will not get past us.

01:49.359 --> 01:50.610
Losing forward deflectors!

01:50.694 --> 01:52.195
We're almost through!

01:56.784 --> 01:57.784
We're not gonna make it!

01:57.868 --> 01:58.910
-We're not gonna make it!
-No!

01:58.994 --> 02:00.036
-Captain Syndulla!
-No!

02:02.706 --> 02:05.792
We lost the transport.
We lost the transport.

02:14.176 --> 02:16.177
All ships, abort! Abort!

02:22.434 --> 02:23.559
We have to get out of here!

02:27.898 --> 02:29.148
We lost Phoenix Leader.

02:29.233 --> 02:30.566
They're cutting us to pieces!

02:30.651 --> 02:33.402
Set heading 267. All ships, jump now!

02:41.912 --> 02:43.704
We must finish this mission.

02:43.789 --> 02:46.165
lf we try again with
our two remaining transports,

02:46.250 --> 02:48.668
I know I can get at least one through.

02:48.752 --> 02:49.836
We don't have much time.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.547
The people of Ibaar won't last
another rotation without our help.

02:52.631 --> 02:57.510
I agree we must try, but our entire
fleet is no match for that blockade.

02:57.594 --> 02:59.428
There is an alternative.

02:59.513 --> 03:03.307
I've been in contact with an engineer
who has no love for the Empire

03:03.392 --> 03:07.019
and who claims to have built a
prototype heavy assault starfighter,

03:07.104 --> 03:08.354
a blockade buster.

03:08.438 --> 03:10.147
What's the problem? Let's get it.

03:10.232 --> 03:13.943
Shipmaster Quarrie
will only discuss his ship in person

03:14.444 --> 03:15.987
on the planet Shantipole.

03:16.113 --> 03:17.071
Shantipole?

03:17.155 --> 03:19.657
Every pilot in the galaxy
knows that's a one-way trip.

03:19.783 --> 03:20.741
Hera will go.

03:20.826 --> 03:21.868
Kanan, no.

03:21.952 --> 03:24.871
I... I've got to lead
the next run on the blockade.

03:24.955 --> 03:28.666
lf that fighter gives us a better chance
to help Ibaar, we have to get it.

03:28.750 --> 03:31.878
And no one else is volunteering to go,
but I know you will.

03:31.962 --> 03:33.462
What do you say, Commander?

03:48.979 --> 03:51.731
I can't believe you volunteered me
for this reckless mission.

03:51.815 --> 03:54.609
After what happened,
the fleet needs me now more than ever.

03:54.693 --> 03:56.527
True, the fleet needs a solution,

03:56.612 --> 03:59.113
but one that neither
you nor Agent Kallus are able to see.

03:59.197 --> 04:01.824
Are we talking in riddles now? ls that it?

04:01.909 --> 04:04.410
Fine. You want me
to spell it out for you?

04:04.494 --> 04:06.120
We can't beat that blockade,

04:06.204 --> 04:08.748
not without a better ship,
with better firepower,

04:08.832 --> 04:10.917
and the best pilot at the controls.

04:11.168 --> 04:14.253
Even if this ship
turns out to be everything we hope it is,

04:14.338 --> 04:16.589
I still might not make it back
in time to help.

04:16.673 --> 04:17.840
Then you better hurry.

04:26.391 --> 04:28.976
So, I guess that makes me copilot.

04:31.772 --> 04:34.732
I called it,
I'm in the chair, I'm copilot.

04:36.735 --> 04:38.694
Kanan, would you tell him
I'm copiloting?

04:39.071 --> 04:42.323
You're co-irritating me, both of you.
Now strap in.

04:42.407 --> 04:45.493
We've got to pick up the last of
the supplies, with or without Hera.

04:58.674 --> 05:01.717
Well, I did a little research
on why it's so hard to land here.

05:01.802 --> 05:02.802
And?

05:02.886 --> 05:05.638
The upper atmosphere is tricky.

05:05.722 --> 05:07.181
Tricky how?

05:07.265 --> 05:08.265
You can get through it,

05:08.350 --> 05:11.018
but your craft never seems
to maintain its power.

05:11.103 --> 05:12.979
What does that mean?

05:13.063 --> 05:14.230
I don't know what that means.

05:14.314 --> 05:18.734
It means no power,
no flying, just falling.

05:18.986 --> 05:21.654
Could've mentioned this
before I got on board!

05:21.738 --> 05:23.114
You wouldn't have come!

05:59.151 --> 06:01.360
Wait. Was that a ship? That was a ship!

06:01.445 --> 06:02.778
That was your imagination.

06:05.949 --> 06:07.533
There! The landing field.

06:07.617 --> 06:09.118
ls that your imagination?

06:09.202 --> 06:10.244
You better hope not.

06:11.621 --> 06:12.663
Brace for landing!

06:30.140 --> 06:31.474
Am I dead?

06:31.850 --> 06:33.642
I don't smell dead.

06:38.690 --> 06:39.815
Zeb!

06:43.695 --> 06:45.571
Zeb, get to the back of the ship!

06:55.749 --> 06:57.166
Who are you?

06:57.834 --> 07:00.503
You're Quarrie, right?
Captain Rex sent us.

07:01.546 --> 07:03.339
You're here about my ship.

07:05.258 --> 07:08.260
Any landing you can walk away from
is a good one.

07:08.345 --> 07:11.680
After a good landing,
you can still fly the ship.

07:12.224 --> 07:15.768
Yeah. You know this is
a terrible place for ships.

07:15.852 --> 07:18.270
But the perfect place to test them.

07:18.355 --> 07:21.107
lf it can fly here, it can fly anywhere.

07:21.399 --> 07:24.693
And it's also the last place
the Empire would look.

07:25.862 --> 07:27.738
Come. Let's get out of this wind.

07:40.752 --> 07:43.587
Pardon the mess.
I don't get many visitors.

07:44.756 --> 07:46.507
Most of 'em crash.

07:47.175 --> 07:49.009
There she is.

07:49.386 --> 07:51.053
What do you think?

07:51.221 --> 07:53.889
I call it the Blade Wing.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.267
That's a ship?

07:56.351 --> 07:57.685
ls it upside down?

07:57.769 --> 07:59.895
Looks like it's been through
a garbage masher.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.815
This is one of my
most advanced designs.

08:02.899 --> 08:05.818
Fast, agile, a narrow attack profile.

08:05.902 --> 08:07.736
And it packs a punch.

08:08.071 --> 08:11.490
High intensity blasters, ion cannons,

08:11.575 --> 08:13.742
and proton torpedoes.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.788
Great. I can't wait to take it out.

08:17.873 --> 08:19.498
The fleet really needs this.

08:19.875 --> 08:21.417
The fleet?

08:21.710 --> 08:25.087
What makes you think
she's yours just for the taking?

08:30.719 --> 08:34.346
I can't believe that old carp
isn't gonna let you fly his ship.

08:34.431 --> 08:37.016
You ask me, he's been
out of the water too long.

08:37.100 --> 08:39.018
I can't fix the Phantom,

08:39.102 --> 08:41.187
not with the spare parts
we have on board.

08:41.271 --> 08:44.148
And more good news.
Our comm system's fried.

08:44.232 --> 08:46.025
We can't contact the Ghost.

08:47.027 --> 08:49.236
So we're stuck here. Perfect.

08:50.071 --> 08:54.200
I noticed your aft stabilizer is cracked.

08:54.284 --> 08:55.618
What else you need?

08:55.785 --> 08:59.538
Power bus relay, a flux converter,
some plasma conduit.

08:59.748 --> 09:01.624
BG will get you sorted.

09:03.126 --> 09:04.210
Thank you.

09:04.628 --> 09:07.796
Look. lf I don't fly your ship, who will?

09:07.923 --> 09:10.799
I've waited a long time
for the right pilot.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.093
I can wait longer.

09:23.271 --> 09:24.271
Report.

09:24.356 --> 09:27.942
We have cut all remaining
rations from the Ibaarian people.

09:28.026 --> 09:29.944
There are a few holdouts
in the mountains

09:30.028 --> 09:32.279
who have been in contact
with the rebel fleet.

09:32.614 --> 09:36.408
Have no fear, Commander.
Their spirit will break soon enough.

09:36.493 --> 09:38.244
What of the rebel fleet?

09:38.328 --> 09:39.787
They will return.

09:39.871 --> 09:43.249
They can't resist
helping people in need,

09:43.500 --> 09:46.460
which will be
the last mistake they make.

09:50.799 --> 09:54.009
You know, you didn't have to
drag us all the way out here.

09:54.094 --> 09:56.136
Could've just transmitted
the plans to Rex.

09:56.346 --> 10:00.474
Why would I hand over my ship
to just any pilot?

10:01.059 --> 10:05.187
Would "any pilot" risk their life
to come to this death trap?

10:05.355 --> 10:08.065
Perhaps not. So why did you?

10:08.441 --> 10:11.485
I was a little girl
when the Clone War came to Ryloth.

10:11.569 --> 10:13.153
My mother hid us below ground,

10:13.238 --> 10:15.906
but I'd peek out
when the Republic ships flew over

10:15.991 --> 10:18.117
as they fought to liberate my world.

10:18.368 --> 10:21.036
I dreamt of nothing more
than to be up there with them.

10:21.413 --> 10:24.081
So, you left your family to fight?

10:24.165 --> 10:26.375
I left my family so I could fly.

10:26.501 --> 10:28.043
As a combat pilot.

10:28.586 --> 10:31.880
lf we want freedom,
we must make difficult choices.

10:31.965 --> 10:35.426
I chose to leave my family,
I chose to learn to fly,

10:35.510 --> 10:39.722
and then I chose to use that
ability to help others in need.

10:40.265 --> 10:43.142
But it's all rooted
in something I can't explain.

10:43.351 --> 10:45.227
A need to be up there.

10:45.895 --> 10:49.440
Because even when
there are explosions all around me,

10:49.524 --> 10:51.567
and things are at their worst,

10:52.485 --> 10:54.778
I feel like I'm at my best.

10:57.282 --> 10:59.158
We've wasted enough time.

10:59.409 --> 11:01.827
There are beings in need of help,

11:01.911 --> 11:05.039
and my ship is in need of a pilot.

11:24.017 --> 11:26.977
I don't understand why we're loading
the Ghost up with the food supplies.

11:27.062 --> 11:28.687
Well, I thought Hera
would be back by now.

11:28.772 --> 11:29.730
But when she went out there,

11:29.814 --> 11:31.982
there was never a guarantee
she'd be back in time.

11:32.067 --> 11:33.525
-So we're making the run.
-Wait.

11:33.610 --> 11:35.778
We're transporting
the supplies in the Ghost?

11:35.862 --> 11:38.280
That'll make us
the Empire's primary target.

11:38.365 --> 11:40.491
Yeah, but the Ghost
is smaller and faster,

11:40.575 --> 11:43.327
so, with any luck,
we'll just slip right by.

11:43.411 --> 11:44.828
You actually believe that?

11:44.913 --> 11:46.914
It makes me feel better when I say it.

11:46.998 --> 11:48.791
Besides, we gotta feed those people.

11:48.958 --> 11:50.417
Now are you in?

12:02.764 --> 12:05.391
You're lucky to have her as your pilot.

12:05.475 --> 12:07.434
How many times have you flown it?

12:07.685 --> 12:09.937
Me? I don't fly.

12:10.021 --> 12:11.397
Too dangerous.

12:11.481 --> 12:14.316
But theoretically, it should fly.

12:14.442 --> 12:15.692
Theoretically?

12:17.112 --> 12:21.198
Better to be down here
wishing I was up there

12:21.282 --> 12:23.992
than up there crashing back down here.

12:24.828 --> 12:27.913
lf that ship crashes,
I'll toss you over the side,

12:27.997 --> 12:29.665
and see how well you fly!

12:41.886 --> 12:43.011
Hera!

12:52.730 --> 12:53.730
-Yes!
-Yes!

13:02.240 --> 13:04.450
Let's see what this beast can do.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.497
Definitely not a freighter.

13:23.178 --> 13:24.178
That's it.

13:38.776 --> 13:40.277
Masterful.

13:41.029 --> 13:42.571
Commencing weapons test.

13:50.705 --> 13:53.707
I was kind of hoping your ship packed
more of a punch, Quarrie.

13:53.791 --> 13:57.252
Did you pull the big lever on the right?

13:57.337 --> 13:59.254
-No.
-Try again.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.226
Yay, I told you.

14:28.952 --> 14:31.370
Your ship certainly has
the firepower we need,

14:31.454 --> 14:33.872
but the targeting system
could use some work.

14:33.957 --> 14:35.374
I've got some ideas.

14:35.458 --> 14:38.627
No, no. That's my ship, young one.

14:38.711 --> 14:41.088
Just what do you think you're doing?

14:41.172 --> 14:44.716
Never get between a Mandalorian
and a weapons package.

14:50.348 --> 14:53.267
It's Kanan. He'll want to hear
about our success.

15:02.819 --> 15:05.737
It has the speed,
maneuverability and weaponry.

15:05.822 --> 15:07.948
This ship is exactly
what the rebellion needs.

15:08.032 --> 15:09.283
That's great news, Hera.

15:09.367 --> 15:10.993
Kanan, they're starting.

15:11.494 --> 15:12.869
What's going on?

15:12.996 --> 15:16.373
The Ibaarians contacted us.
They're at their breaking point.

15:17.417 --> 15:18.875
We can't wait any longer.

15:18.960 --> 15:21.587
Sato's ordered the second
attack on the blockade.

15:24.924 --> 15:27.718
We need to get moving. The second
attack is about to commence.

15:27.802 --> 15:29.261
Well, we've got a problem.

15:29.345 --> 15:33.307
The energy drain from the multi-cannon
firing system killed the hyperdrive.

15:33.391 --> 15:35.017
ln Basic, please.

15:35.518 --> 15:38.020
The weapons work,
but we've got no lightspeed.

15:38.187 --> 15:40.230
Well, that has been a problem.

15:40.315 --> 15:42.065
It's been a problem?

15:42.150 --> 15:43.692
You... You mean you knew about this?

15:43.776 --> 15:45.986
What did you expect for a prototype?

15:46.070 --> 15:49.197
There are all sorts of
adjustments that need to be made.

15:49.282 --> 15:53.160
For instance, I don't even
like this paint job so much...

15:53.870 --> 15:55.245
Come here, fish face.

15:55.413 --> 15:57.247
-I want to see if you can fly.
-What the...

15:57.457 --> 15:59.541
Hang on. Hang on, Zeb. Easy.

16:02.962 --> 16:05.255
There must be a way to solve this.

16:05.632 --> 16:09.301
It's a shame I had BG
install that other hyperdrive

16:09.385 --> 16:10.469
on the Phantom.

16:10.553 --> 16:11.595
You what?

16:11.679 --> 16:14.431
I don't like seeing a ship that can't fly.

16:14.515 --> 16:16.516
During the repairs, I upgraded it,

16:16.601 --> 16:18.644
because if you don't have a hyperdrive,

16:18.728 --> 16:20.228
you can't fly far.

16:21.606 --> 16:24.566
You beautiful, crazy Mon Calamari!

16:25.693 --> 16:27.778
That's the answer to our problem.

16:29.197 --> 16:31.156
What? What's the answer?

16:36.412 --> 16:39.164
Sir, enemy ships
are approaching from sector nine.

16:39.248 --> 16:40.540
Scan the rebel ships.

16:40.625 --> 16:43.669
The one which carries the relief
supplies will be our primary target.

16:43.753 --> 16:45.712
Initiating scan now, sir.

16:57.058 --> 16:58.600
Command ship, I'll follow your lead.

16:58.685 --> 17:01.311
Hopefully we can break through their
line and make a run for the surface.

17:01.521 --> 17:03.188
Whose idea was this again?

17:06.943 --> 17:09.903
Sir, comscan has identified
the Corellian VCX

17:09.987 --> 17:11.530
as the supply transport.

17:11.614 --> 17:12.948
Of course.

17:13.449 --> 17:16.451
Commander, focus all fire on the Ghost.

17:25.002 --> 17:26.253
Fighter incoming.

17:28.339 --> 17:30.257
Rex, keep those TIEs off our back!

17:31.175 --> 17:32.300
Workin' on it!

17:44.480 --> 17:46.982
Better pick up the pace.
The cruisers are closing the gap!

17:55.324 --> 17:56.324
We're cut off!

17:58.119 --> 18:00.829
I'm gonna swing around
and try from another direction.

18:00.913 --> 18:02.080
Stay on course, Ghost.

18:02.165 --> 18:03.999
I'll knock that cruiser out of your way.

18:07.044 --> 18:08.587
Turn me loose, Phantom.

18:08.671 --> 18:10.547
Say hello to Kallus for me.

18:10.631 --> 18:13.008
We will. lf there's anything left of him.

18:21.309 --> 18:23.518
Sir, rebel reinforcements have arrived.

18:23.603 --> 18:27.022
One shuttle and one ship
of unknown design.

18:27.231 --> 18:29.649
I would hardly call that reinforcements.

18:35.156 --> 18:36.990
You boys better give me some room.

18:37.074 --> 18:38.283
You heard the captain.

18:40.953 --> 18:42.996
Sabine, we'll get one shot at this.

18:43.080 --> 18:44.748
Then it's a good thing you trust me.

18:54.217 --> 18:56.468
Sir, the unidentified ship
is taking the lead.

18:56.719 --> 18:59.721
It's moving into attack position
off our starboard side.

19:02.058 --> 19:04.059
Steady. Steady!

19:05.895 --> 19:07.229
A little closer.

19:08.606 --> 19:09.606
Fire!

19:17.907 --> 19:19.741
That's impossible.

19:23.037 --> 19:24.663
We're clear! Going in.

19:24.747 --> 19:27.040
We'll hold off any pursuit
once you've made the jump out.

19:27.458 --> 19:29.876
We'll meet you back at the rendezvous.

19:34.131 --> 19:35.131
Okay.

19:35.216 --> 19:37.717
So, maybe it's not
such a hunk of junk after all.

19:42.306 --> 19:43.807
We're over the drop zone now.

19:43.891 --> 19:45.100
Releasing cargo.

19:50.314 --> 19:52.107
We've recovered the drop.

19:52.191 --> 19:55.026
Thank you, Phoenix Squadron.
You've saved us.

19:55.111 --> 19:56.278
You've saved us all.

19:56.904 --> 19:58.280
You're welcome.

20:07.665 --> 20:10.041
We have confirmation
the drop was successful.

20:10.126 --> 20:11.626
Let's go home, Phoenix Squadron.

20:34.692 --> 20:39.362
It seems Senator Organa has found
a ship works sympathetic to our cause,

20:39.447 --> 20:42.699
and willing to manufacture
more of these B-wings in secret.

20:42.783 --> 20:45.327
Project Shantipole will continue

20:45.411 --> 20:47.913
under my supervision, of course.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.916
There are many adjustments
that need be made.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.084
Quarrie, thanks to you and your ship,

20:53.169 --> 20:54.920
we helped many people today.

20:55.212 --> 20:58.256
I just hammered it together, young pilot.

20:59.133 --> 21:01.009
You made it soar.

21:01.177 --> 21:02.177
Indeed.

21:02.261 --> 21:05.805
Your heroics are unparalleled,
Captain Syndulla.

21:05.890 --> 21:08.516
That is why I agree
with Kanan's recommendation.

21:08.601 --> 21:10.018
Your recommendation?

21:10.102 --> 21:11.269
What have you done now?

21:11.354 --> 21:13.063
Just listen to the commander.

21:13.147 --> 21:15.565
You are to be promoted
to Phoenix Leader.

21:15.650 --> 21:19.069
Our fighter pilots
will benefit greatly from your expertise.

21:22.615 --> 21:24.991
Good job, Captain Hera.
