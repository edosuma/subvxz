FOR ANOTHER MISSION.

37:04.763 --> 37:07.225
HE DESERVED JUSTICE.

37:07.225 --> 37:08.647
THEN HE GOT OFF.

37:08.647 --> 37:10.729
SO SOMEBODY
HAD TO PUNISH HIM, RIGHT?

37:12.060 --> 37:15.484
I GOT CYRUS' ADDRESS
FROM MY SISTER'S FILES.

37:15.484 --> 37:16.855
I WENT THERE.

37:19.117 --> 37:20.859
I'D NEVER DONE ANYTHING
BEFORE.

37:22.240 --> 37:24.663
I WAS ALWAYS TOO SCARED --
NOT LIKE LINDA.

37:26.325 --> 37:30.499
AND FOR ONCE IN MY LIFE,
I...TOOK ACTION.

37:36.174 --> 37:37.586
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

37:39.298 --> 37:41.380
I'M NOT SORRY HE'S DEAD.

37:50.148 --> 37:51.440
HEY.
HI.

37:51.440 --> 37:54.232
IF WE HURRY,
WE CAN STILL GO DO THAT THING.

37:55.654 --> 37:57.105
LET'S DO IT.

37:58.196 --> 38:00.399
UH, HEY, YOU COOL
CATCHING A CAB?

38:00.399 --> 38:02.361
KATE AND I...
HAVE AN APPOINTMENT.

38:02.361 --> 38:03.452
OF COURSE.

38:03.452 --> 38:05.404
CONGRATULATIONS,
BY THE WAY.

38:06.905 --> 38:08.747
OH. SHE TOLD YOU?

38:08.747 --> 38:10.118
I'M VERY HAPPY FOR YOU.

38:11.500 --> 38:12.911
THANKS, PAL.

38:23.131 --> 38:25.474
I CAN GIVE YOU SOMETHING
FOR THAT, YOU KNOW.

38:25.474 --> 38:27.015
NO, YOU CAN'T.

38:28.727 --> 38:30.479
BUT I KNOW WHO CAN.

38:33.772 --> 38:35.934
HERE WE GO.

38:36.985 --> 38:38.357
I CAN'T DO THIS.

38:38.357 --> 38:39.898
YOU'RE BACKING OUT?

38:39.898 --> 38:42.401
NO!
NO. NOT AT ALL.

38:42.401 --> 38:44.363
I JUST CAN'T DO IT
HERE --

38:44.363 --> 38:47.245
IN THE JUDGE'S CHAMBERS
ON A THURSDAY,

38:47.245 --> 38:50.579
AND THEN GO...
ORDER TAKEOUT OR SOMETHING.

38:50.579 --> 38:53.251
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE IT,
YOU KNOW, PAINLESS.

38:53.251 --> 38:55.163
I KNOW. I KNOW.

38:55.163 --> 38:57.295
AND WHEN YOU WANTED
TO DO IT RIGHT AWAY,

38:57.295 --> 38:58.877
I WAS -- I WAS STOKED
ABOUT THAT.

38:58.877 --> 39:01.339
BUT WHEN IT KEPT
GETTING PUSHED BACK,

39:01.339 --> 39:03.552
I THOUGHT
THAT MAYBE IT WAS A SIGN.

39:03.552 --> 39:05.263
A SIGN?

39:05.263 --> 39:07.175
THAT WE'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO
DO IT LIKE THIS.

39:09.347 --> 39:11.349
LOOK...

39:11.349 --> 39:13.311
WHEN WE GOT MARRIED
THE FIRST TIME,

39:13.311 --> 39:16.354
WE ELOPED BECAUSE YOUR DAD
HATED MY GUTS,

39:16.354 --> 39:18.687
AND WE DIDN'T MAKE
A BIG DEAL OUT OF IT.

39:18.687 --> 39:22.531
MAYBE WE DIDN'T
TAKE IT SERIOUSLY ENOUGH.

39:22.531 --> 39:25.404
AND MAYBE
SOME OF THAT SENTIMENT

39:25.404 --> 39:28.326
SEEPED ITS WAY
INTO OUR MARRIAGE.

39:28.326 --> 39:29.908
I DON'T KNOW.

39:29.908 --> 39:32.661
ALL I KNOW IS...

39:32.661 --> 39:35.704
I WANT TO MARRY YOU
IN A CHURCH,

39:35.704 --> 39:37.496
WITH A PRIEST,

39:37.496 --> 39:42.050
IN FRONT OF OUR FRIENDS
AND FAMILY.

39:42.050 --> 39:45.173
AND I WANT A BIG PARTY
WITH A CRAPPY DEEJAY,

39:45.173 --> 39:47.345
AND I WANT TO DANCE
THE FUNKY CHICKEN,

39:47.345 --> 39:50.429
AND I WANT
A BIG, LONG ENGAGEMENT.

39:50.429 --> 39:51.810
AND I WANT TO REGISTER

39:51.810 --> 39:54.312
BECAUSE I WANT
A NEW BLENDER.

39:54.312 --> 39:55.564
OURS SUCKS.

39:55.564 --> 39:58.517
OKAY.

39:58.517 --> 40:00.479
WE'LL REGISTER
FOR A DAMN BLENDER.

40:00.479 --> 40:03.021
Daniel: "STICKS AND STONES
MAY BREAK MY BONES,

40:03.021 --> 40:06.074
BUT WORDS WILL NEVER HURT ME."

40:07.826 --> 40:10.028
OR WILL THEY?

40:10.028 --> 40:12.410
THE SAME AREAS OF THE BRAIN
GET ACTIVATED

40:12.410 --> 40:15.454
WHEN WE EXPERIENCE
SOCIAL REJECTION

40:15.454 --> 40:17.796
OR THE BETRAYAL
OF A LOVED ONE

40:17.796 --> 40:20.418
AS WHEN WE SPILL HOT COFFEE
ON OUR ARM.

40:20.418 --> 40:25.504
IN OTHER WORDS, EMOTIONAL PAIN
HURTS THE SAME AS PHYSICAL PAIN.

40:25.504 --> 40:28.637
SCIENCE HAS DEVELOPED DRUGS
THAT CAN ALLEVIATE

40:28.637 --> 40:31.309
AND, IN SOME CASES,
ELIMINATE OUR PHYSICAL PAIN,

40:31.309 --> 40:34.352
AND SOME OF THOSE SAME DRUGS
ARE NOW PROVING HELPFUL

40:34.352 --> 40:37.055
IN ELIMINATING
OUR EMOTIONAL PAIN.

40:37.055 --> 40:39.728
SO THE PRESCRIPTION FOR A BROKEN
HEART MIGHT ACTUALLY BE

40:39.728 --> 40:41.900
"TAKE TWO TYLENOL
AND CALL ME IN THE MORNING."

40:41.900 --> 40:44.272
[ LAUGHTER ]

40:44.272 --> 40:47.776
BUT IS NUMBING OUR PAIN
ALWAYS A GOOD THING?

40:49.618 --> 40:54.913
THE MORE WE KNOW PAIN,
IN ALL ITS VARYING FLAVORS,

40:54.913 --> 40:57.035
THE MORE WE CAN APPRECIATE
THE SENSATIONS

40:57.035 --> 40:59.037
AND THE FEELINGS THAT WE LIKE.

40:59.037 --> 41:00.749
THAT'S THE NATURE OF CONTRAST.

41:00.749 --> 41:04.583
IF WE NEVER FELT BITTERNESS
OR ANGER,

41:04.583 --> 41:08.256
THEN WE -- WE WOULDN'T
DEEPLY APPRECIATE OUR HAPPINESS.

41:08.256 --> 41:12.891
AND IF WE NEVER KNEW FEAR,
THEN WE COULDN'T ADMIRE COURAGE.

41:12.891 --> 41:16.765
SO MAYBE TO MORE FULLY ENJOY
THE BEAUTY IN OUR LIVES,

41:16.765 --> 41:21.479
WE MUST FIRST ACKNOWLEDGE
AND EMBRACE OUR PAIN.
