WEBVTT

00:04.421 --> 00:07.048
[Whispers] Hey. Come on in.

00:07.048 --> 00:08.843
-Hey.
-Oh, hey.

00:08.843 --> 00:10.344
What's going on in there?

00:10.344 --> 00:12.471
Uh, just a little thing I
started, Poster Friday's.

00:12.471 --> 00:14.890
Social, some drinks.
Put up a poster right?

00:14.890 --> 00:16.684
So the kids can't see us
having a few drinks.

00:16.684 --> 00:18.686
I have to start doing
a better job keeping track

00:18.686 --> 00:20.521
of what's going on
socially around here.

00:20.521 --> 00:23.064
Yeah, yeah. Oh, I don't
think that's a good idea Robert.

00:23.064 --> 00:25.901
-Everybody's having fun and...
-Yeah.

00:25.901 --> 00:28.570
You're the Vice Principal
though, right?

00:28.570 --> 00:30.948
-Yeah. I get it.
-Yeah.

00:30.948 --> 00:32.950
I'm technically their boss,
right? So...

00:32.950 --> 00:34.660
-True.
-Who'd want to drink
with their boss?

00:34.660 --> 00:36.954
-Exactly.
-So, guess that's what I get

00:36.954 --> 00:38.747
-for joining the administration.
-Exactly.

00:38.747 --> 00:40.374
-Excuse me Robert.
-Oh hey, sir.

00:40.374 --> 00:42.710
Hey, listen if you see Trudy,
let Trudy know.

00:42.710 --> 00:44.545
-If...what?...
-Thanks.

00:44.545 --> 00:47.715
-[cheers from inside classroom]

01:01.979 --> 01:06.984
-Hey! Bill, check this out.
-What's this?

01:06.984 --> 01:10.111
It's Paul Dwyer, he teaches at
my school and he's stripping.

01:10.111 --> 01:12.113
-The Manaconda?
-That's him!

01:12.113 --> 01:14.491
Yeah? How can you tell?
His face is all covered up.

01:14.491 --> 01:16.869
'Cause I teach with him
every day Bill. I know
what he looks like.

01:16.869 --> 01:20.163
This guy thinks he's Mr.
Perfect. And he's a stripper!

01:20.163 --> 01:22.624
I don't know if that's him.
Maybe you should just ask him.

01:22.624 --> 01:25.002
-Instead of jumping
to conclusions.
-Ask him?

01:25.002 --> 01:27.004
You think he's gonna
admit to it? Mr. Charity here.

01:27.004 --> 01:28.296
How many nicknames do you
have for this guy?

01:28.296 --> 01:29.464
Mr. Perfect, Mr. Charity.

01:29.464 --> 01:31.592
-Manaconda.
-Mr. D.

01:31.592 --> 01:34.511
No, not for long. Okay? I'm
gonna go to the strip joint.

01:34.511 --> 01:36.680
And I'm going to record him
stripping.

01:36.680 --> 01:38.849
You cannot record video
at a strip club.

01:38.849 --> 01:40.935
I'm not going to set up
a tripod, Bill.

01:40.935 --> 01:42.853
I'm going to be discreet.
Come with me.

01:42.853 --> 01:44.312
No, I don't watch men undress.

01:44.312 --> 01:46.941
Don't tell me you've never
stumbled upon gay porn.

01:46.941 --> 01:49.693
And then accidentally watched
it for a few seconds.

01:49.693 --> 01:51.653
-Like how many seconds?
-Three minutes.

01:51.653 --> 01:54.406
-Nope.
-Me neither.

01:55.866 --> 01:57.743
Good luck with this.

01:59.494 --> 02:04.041
More, two, two minutes,
then I realized what it was.

02:05.834 --> 02:09.964
Hello Trudy. I know you hate
Secre... this particular day.

02:09.964 --> 02:15.844
But we did want to express how
much we appreciate everything
that you do around here.

02:15.844 --> 02:18.138
-Thank you, sir.
-And if I could just add...

02:18.138 --> 02:20.515
-No, you could not.
-Okay.

02:20.515 --> 02:23.184
Happy Secretary's Day Trudy.

02:23.184 --> 02:26.688
Did you guys plan anything
for her special day?

02:31.610 --> 02:33.612
Absolutely not.

02:33.612 --> 02:36.490
Well that's crazy!
This is Secretary's Day.

02:36.490 --> 02:42.162
It's a very important day
for a very important part
of any office.

02:42.162 --> 02:46.792
I mean, I don't know that many
secretaries, but I know you are
so good at your job.

02:46.792 --> 02:50.004
So I gonna to make your
Secretary's Day the best

02:50.004 --> 02:52.756
Secretary's Day in the history
of Secretary's Days.

02:52.756 --> 02:56.551
[laughs] All right,
I'll be back. Whoo!

02:58.345 --> 03:00.097
Let's go.

03:03.934 --> 03:06.020
Hey, Wayne,
have you seen Bobbi?

03:06.020 --> 03:08.063
Do I look like
I've seen Bobbi?

03:08.063 --> 03:10.398
What does that even mean?
How would you look if
you've seen Bobbi?

03:10.398 --> 03:14.695
-Like this.
-Oh, that's the "I've
seen Bobbi" look?

03:14.695 --> 03:17.072
-I've seen someone.
-All right.

03:17.072 --> 03:19.158
I need to find Bobbi because I
need to get my five dollars in

03:19.158 --> 03:21.535
-for this weeks lottery pool.
-How did you find out
about that?

03:21.535 --> 03:24.038
I am always in that.

03:24.038 --> 03:26.957
The more people that find
out about that, the less
money there is to win.

03:26.957 --> 03:29.126
Wayne, there's 35 million
dollars up for grabs.

03:29.126 --> 03:31.003
There's enough money
for everybody.

03:31.003 --> 03:32.546
You guys don't want to know
what I would do

03:32.546 --> 03:36.133
-if I won that kind of money.
-No.

03:37.384 --> 03:39.053
[whispers] Sorry.

03:40.762 --> 03:42.931
You know how many panda
bears I would buy Wayne?

03:42.931 --> 03:44.975
-Fifty-three.
-What?

03:44.975 --> 03:47.728
Are you gonna tell me where
Bobbi is or not?

03:47.728 --> 03:51.398
[Malik] She's with the team.
The racketcock's until 7:00.

03:51.398 --> 03:54.776
-What team?
-You know the team,
The racketcocks.

03:54.776 --> 03:56.653
It's called badminton.
And they're shuttlecocks.

03:56.653 --> 03:58.613
-Yes, same thing.
-[Gerry] No.

03:58.613 --> 04:01.158
Okay, look, I gotta leave.
I need you to do me a favor.

04:01.158 --> 04:04.119
-Okay. Sure.
-I need you to give Bobbi
five dollars from me.

04:04.119 --> 04:06.329
-I give to Boobi.
-You to sign my name
on the lottery sheet.

04:06.329 --> 04:08.040
-[Malik] I do all the time.
-Don't forget.

04:08.040 --> 04:09.332
-[Malik] I won't!
-Okay.

04:09.332 --> 04:12.669
If you are for serious
about pandas...

04:13.503 --> 04:15.630
...Malik knows a guy.

04:17.883 --> 04:20.594
Yeah, I don't...
I don't need a panda.

04:20.594 --> 04:23.471
-Five dollars.
-[Gerry] Yeah, yeah.

04:26.058 --> 04:28.268
-Hey, Paul.
-Gerry.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.353
What are you up to tonight?

04:30.353 --> 04:33.356
I got a lot of marking to do,
so I'll probably just hang
and do that.

04:33.356 --> 04:36.443
Yeah? Anything else
hanging tonight?

04:36.443 --> 04:39.446
-Excuse me?
-Are you hanging with anyone
else tonight?

04:39.446 --> 04:41.240
No, when I'm marking I just
gotta be by myself.

04:41.240 --> 04:43.658
Mmm, not me man.
Speeds up the process

04:43.658 --> 04:45.368
when I have other people
around when I'm marking.

04:45.368 --> 04:47.328
-How's that?
-Invite some friends over,
have a few drinks.

04:47.328 --> 04:49.957
Pass out some stuff to mark,
it's done, quick.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.541
-Are they teachers?
-No.

04:51.541 --> 04:53.127
So, how do they know
what they're marking?

04:53.127 --> 04:54.669
'Cause they're adults,
they're not stupid.

04:54.669 --> 04:57.256
They can mark high school stuff.
It's not hard.

04:57.256 --> 05:00.801
And plus, it frees up my time,
for maybe another job if I want.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.719
Hey, well teaching's a full
time job for me.

05:02.719 --> 05:06.640
-So I'll see you later, Gerry.
-[to himself] Or tonight.

05:08.142 --> 05:13.105
Obviously a stripper.
[chuckles]

05:13.105 --> 05:17.276
-Hey, guys.
-Hi, Gerry.

05:17.276 --> 05:20.403
Tonight... you lose
your virginity.

05:20.403 --> 05:23.364
-Thanks Gerry, but I like women.
-Not with me.

05:23.364 --> 05:25.284
With girls. We're going
to a strip joint.

05:25.284 --> 05:27.494
Oh no, no, no, no thanks.
Not really my scene.

05:27.494 --> 05:30.164
-I'm more of a sci-fi fan.
-Dwyer is a stripper.

05:30.164 --> 05:32.916
And you know who goes to strip
joints to see male strippers?

05:32.916 --> 05:35.376
Hundreds of women,
looking for their Simon.

05:35.376 --> 05:37.336
-Dwyer's a stripper?
-Yes.

05:37.336 --> 05:38.922
I didn't know that.

05:38.922 --> 05:41.258
Has everybody in the school
been talking about this?

05:41.258 --> 05:43.468
-They know this?
-No. It's a secret life.

05:43.468 --> 05:47.472
That I uncovered,
'cause he wears a mask,
'cause he is "The Manaconda"!

05:47.472 --> 05:49.016
-Look at that.
-Manaconda?

05:49.016 --> 05:52.227
-That's his name.
-Great name.

05:52.227 --> 05:55.689
What? No, that's not Dwyer.

05:55.689 --> 05:59.109
-That is Dwyer.
-No, Dwyer's got
a different chin.

05:59.109 --> 06:01.569
-No, Simon.
-It does look like Dwyer's lips.

06:01.569 --> 06:03.697
That's Dwyer's little moustache
for sure.

06:03.697 --> 06:06.491
That's Dwyer.
And he's stripping on the side.

06:06.491 --> 06:08.535
And we gotta
catch him in the act.

06:08.535 --> 06:11.621
Because he's not being a very
good role model, okay?

06:11.621 --> 06:14.749
-I don't know, Gerry, who cares?
-We can't have a guy stripping
when he's a teacher.

06:14.749 --> 06:18.628
Now, are you in or not?
Think of the girls.

06:18.628 --> 06:22.841
Okay, I'm in.
But we can't hurt Paul.

06:22.841 --> 06:26.345
When we go, you can't be doing
all this. You gotta be cool.

06:26.345 --> 06:29.890
-Okay.
-Just, act like you belong.

06:29.890 --> 06:33.810
-What should I wear?
-I don't know,
wear your lab coat.

06:33.810 --> 06:36.437
Get on stage. Wear nothing
under it, that'd be fun.

06:36.437 --> 06:39.024
Maybe they'll call you up,
maybe there's an amateur night.

06:43.402 --> 06:46.365
[laughs] No, no, no, no!

06:46.365 --> 06:50.535
[Lisa] Hey, Trudy.
Okay.

06:50.535 --> 06:53.663
Robert, today
is Secretary's Day,

06:53.663 --> 06:55.707
so I need you to go get
me some coffee.

06:55.707 --> 06:57.416
That's not Trudy's job today.

06:57.416 --> 07:00.921
Okay, sir, I will do it today
since it is Secretary's Day.

07:00.921 --> 07:04.925
You guys are too much.
If I don't have to get Mr.
Callaghan's coffee

07:04.925 --> 07:08.095
then I have nothing to do today.
Maybe I should just go home.

07:08.095 --> 07:11.348
Yes you should Trudy, because
today, Robert is my secretary.

07:11.348 --> 07:13.892
Okay, sir.

07:13.892 --> 07:17.729
[laughs] Yay!
Happy Secretary's Day, Trudy.

07:17.729 --> 07:20.023
Isn't that charming.

07:20.023 --> 07:24.194
Ms. Mason, is that what you
think I do here at the school?

07:24.194 --> 07:27.281
No, it was just a sweet thing
that the kids put together.

07:27.281 --> 07:29.908
How about you guys go
back to lunch?

07:29.908 --> 07:31.993
Okay, good job.
Really good job.

07:31.993 --> 07:33.787
I think you should leave too.

07:33.787 --> 07:36.456
Oh, okay, I don't get it Trudy.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.417
It was just a really sweet thing
they put together.

07:38.417 --> 07:39.709
I thought it was adorable.

07:39.709 --> 07:42.045
You know what?
I'm a little busy here.

07:42.045 --> 07:46.591
It may surprise you to know
that I have some non-coffee
related work to do, okay?

07:46.591 --> 07:48.385
Okay, I am so sorry.

07:48.385 --> 07:51.346
Look, let's do
a real celebration.

07:51.346 --> 07:54.599
I'll get the staff together,
we can all have some drinks.

07:54.599 --> 07:56.935
We'll take you out
and we'll celebrate.

07:56.935 --> 07:59.438
They're not going to put on
a play are they?

07:59.438 --> 08:01.481
No, no play. Just drinks.

08:01.481 --> 08:04.525
Fine, but only because
I really like drinks.

08:04.525 --> 08:06.778
Yeah, I know.

08:06.778 --> 08:08.155
Okay.

08:10.698 --> 08:13.868
[up-tempo music playing]

08:13.868 --> 08:16.246
Okay, we gotta be discreet.
We'll probably be the only
guys in here.

08:16.246 --> 08:18.832
Lay low. Got it.

08:27.757 --> 08:29.550
Hold on.

08:29.550 --> 08:32.762
Well, looks like we weren't the
only guys with this idea, Gerry.

08:32.762 --> 08:36.599
-Oh, my God.
-Got some competition
for these ladies.

08:36.599 --> 08:40.479
-Where are the ladies?
-No.

08:43.940 --> 08:46.485
I think these guys
want to fight us.

08:46.485 --> 08:47.902
They've been staring at us
since we got in here.

08:47.902 --> 08:49.946
Trust me, they don't
want to fight us.

08:49.946 --> 08:52.782
-When do the women get here?
-Look, there's no women okay?

08:52.782 --> 08:56.203
I didn't know, it's a gay strip
club. I didn't know that.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.413
-You tricked me, Gerry.
-I didn't trick you.

08:58.413 --> 09:00.457
I honestly didn't know.
All right?

09:00.457 --> 09:03.293
We're here, we'll find Dwyer,
they'll think we're a couple.
It doesn't matter.

09:03.293 --> 09:05.753
-I like that they'll
think we're a couple.
-Ah, of course you do.

09:05.753 --> 09:08.006
It means they see our
friendship in the way we
carry ourselves.

09:08.006 --> 09:10.509
Yes, they do.
What are you doing?

09:10.509 --> 09:12.719
Well, well. Dance?

09:12.719 --> 09:15.263
-We're dating.
-[Gerry sighs]

09:15.263 --> 09:17.474
Okay, well if you
change your mind...

09:17.474 --> 09:19.600
-[Simon] I like meat?
-[blows a kiss]

09:19.600 --> 09:22.521
The nerve of that guy, talking
to me right in front of you.

09:22.521 --> 09:25.190
Okay, you don't have to fake
it that much. All right?

09:25.190 --> 09:27.567
You're just mad because
he liked me more.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.444
Agh! I'm not mad, Simon.

09:29.444 --> 09:31.446
He came to you 'cause
he's a skinny stripper.

09:31.446 --> 09:34.115
Skinny stripper, skinny guy.
He knows I'm out of his league.

09:34.115 --> 09:36.535
-He's not going
to try to get me.
-[Simon] Hmmm.

09:36.535 --> 09:41.456
Oh, get out of here. He's with
me and we don't want any dances.

09:41.456 --> 09:43.624
I'm detecting
a little jealousy.

09:43.624 --> 09:45.752
Don't worry, 'cause guess who
I'm leaving here with tonight?

09:45.752 --> 09:47.379
-Oh, boy.
-You.

09:47.379 --> 09:49.089
Simon!

09:49.089 --> 09:51.925
The reason they're coming to you

09:51.925 --> 09:55.429
is because they think you will
pay them to dance for you.

09:55.429 --> 09:58.765
That's why they're not coming
to me, 'cause they think
that's what you will do.

09:58.765 --> 10:01.893
You will pay. If I wanted
these guys coming up to me,

10:01.893 --> 10:03.811
I would get them
coming up to me.

10:03.811 --> 10:06.814
-Okay, let's see.
-I don't need to prove
it to you.

10:06.814 --> 10:09.443
-Step out.
-If I step out, they're
going to come to me.

10:09.443 --> 10:11.736
And they're going to
think I want dances,
and I don't want that.

10:11.736 --> 10:13.821
-But I could if I wanted.
-Step out.

10:13.821 --> 10:15.115
-I could step out.
-Step out.

10:15.115 --> 10:17.909
Just gotta come out
a little bit.

10:17.909 --> 10:20.078
Get away from you.
Hello.

10:20.078 --> 10:21.621
Sir.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.123
He didn't hear me.

10:26.543 --> 10:29.670
All right, they've
got straight-dar.

10:29.670 --> 10:31.339
Face it, Gerry.
I've got what it takes

10:31.339 --> 10:33.467
to make men want me
to pay them to dance for me.

10:33.467 --> 10:35.676
Gettin' a drink.

10:38.930 --> 10:41.433
I'm sorry it's just
the two of us.

10:41.433 --> 10:44.727
I guess it was too last minute
to get anyone else out.

10:44.727 --> 10:47.063
That's all right,
don't worry about it.

10:47.063 --> 10:49.274
I'm having a grand old time,

10:49.274 --> 10:52.611
sitting at a bar,
drinking with you, alone.

10:52.611 --> 10:55.447
-Yeah.

10:55.447 --> 10:59.576
So, the Xavier volleyball team
is doing really well this year.

10:59.576 --> 11:02.787
-Are they?
-Yeah.

11:02.787 --> 11:05.624
Maybe we should just
get the bill.

11:05.624 --> 11:08.543
-You called?
-[Trudy laughs] Oh, Bill.

11:08.543 --> 11:10.753
-Bill, bill. A little humor.
-[Lisa laughs]

11:10.753 --> 11:13.089
[Trudy] Good one. This is very
nice, what's this all about?

11:13.089 --> 11:16.176
I figured you guys were
regulars and you gotta work
with my roommate so...

11:16.176 --> 11:18.136
-[Trudy laughs] Oh.
-I got you a round
of drinks on me.

11:18.136 --> 11:20.514
-That's very sweet, Bill.
-Thank you, that's who I am.

11:20.514 --> 11:22.849
[Trudy] Mmm.

11:22.849 --> 11:26.186
All right, well I'll let you
get back to the rest of your
evening.

11:26.186 --> 11:29.272
-[Lisa mouths] Stop it.
-But also, also
I was wondering...

11:29.272 --> 11:31.441
-What are you guys talking
-about? Volleyball.

11:31.441 --> 11:33.860
Volleyball,
that's a weird choice.

11:33.860 --> 11:35.862
Usually people just, like,
complain about their co-workers.

11:35.862 --> 11:38.948
Or talk about, like, who's
hooked up and who's single.

11:38.948 --> 11:42.785
-And who's not single and...
You guys are both single, right?
-Yeah, yeah. We are.

11:42.785 --> 11:46.289
Yeah? Okay.
Worth knowing. Good to know.

11:46.289 --> 11:48.749
[laughs] Well I have a
story about Callaghan.

11:48.749 --> 11:52.546
And a certain English teacher
who no longer works at Xavier.

11:52.546 --> 11:54.548
-Nooo.
-Ta-da.

11:54.548 --> 11:57.258
-I'm all ears.
-See, I'm very good at
starting conversations.

11:57.258 --> 11:59.052
-Maybe I could
show you sometime.
-No, Bill.

11:59.052 --> 12:01.429
That's okay, thank you.
I want to hear this story.

12:01.429 --> 12:03.764
All right, well,
enjoy the free drinks.

12:03.764 --> 12:05.350
-[mouths] Thanks.
-[Trudy] You are all ears.

12:05.350 --> 12:07.644
I didn't want to say anything,
but you kind of are.

12:07.644 --> 12:11.147
-Anyway, Callaghan...
-Hey Bobbi, it's Gerry.

12:11.147 --> 12:14.401
Listen, I just want you to know
I gave Malik my five dollars

12:14.401 --> 12:16.110
for this week's
lottery pool. Okay?

12:16.110 --> 12:17.571
I forgot to see you,

12:17.571 --> 12:19.447
I don't want to miss
that in case we win.

12:19.447 --> 12:22.534
So I'm officially leaving you
a message and here's Simon.

12:22.534 --> 12:25.203
He's my witness, just to
confirm. Tell Bobbi I left
the money with Malik.

12:25.203 --> 12:27.455
Hi Bobbi! You'll never believe
where Gerry took me.

12:27.455 --> 12:29.957
[Gerry] What are you doing?
Anyway, thank you Bobbi.

12:29.957 --> 12:31.292
I just want to confirm.

12:31.292 --> 12:33.545
I, Gerry Duncan, am officially

12:33.545 --> 12:35.129
in this week's
staff lottery pool.

12:35.129 --> 12:37.215
I will sign the sheet
when I get back okay.

12:37.215 --> 12:39.842
I just, I don't want to miss it.
All right?

12:39.842 --> 12:42.303
Oh, God, that's a relief
'cause I never want
to miss that. Right?

12:42.303 --> 12:43.680
What happens if we win?

12:43.680 --> 12:45.098
No, if we won
and you weren't in it,

12:45.098 --> 12:46.765
we couldn't be friends anymore.

12:46.765 --> 12:48.393
-And why is that?
-Money changes people.

12:48.393 --> 12:50.895
-I'd be better than you.
-Is Manaconda working tonight?

12:50.895 --> 12:54.733
Yeah, he is. Not on stage
tonight, he's working VIP.

12:54.733 --> 12:57.736
Twenty bucks a song,
worth every penny.

12:57.736 --> 13:00.614
Okay, do they play the whole
song? Or do they cut it off
halfway?

13:00.614 --> 13:02.781
I hate when they cut it
off and you're right
in the middle of it.

13:02.781 --> 13:05.577
-Did you guys want a drink?
-Okay, yeah, let's get a drink.

13:05.577 --> 13:08.913
-Umm, do you have any coolers?
-What kind?

13:10.665 --> 13:15.420
What?! Are you serious?
That's strawberry, banana, kiwi!

13:15.420 --> 13:18.965
Light! I've never seen light.

13:18.965 --> 13:20.717
I like this place.

13:20.717 --> 13:24.887
Here's one. Who would you
rather, Malik or Simon?

13:24.887 --> 13:28.182
-Who would I rather what?
-Oh, my God, seriously?

13:28.182 --> 13:30.393
-Oh, you mean like...?
-Yeah, uh-huh.

13:30.393 --> 13:34.188
-Neither, they're both friends.
-Come on, everybody's your
friend.

13:34.188 --> 13:35.774
You must have some heat
with somebody.

13:35.774 --> 13:39.277
No, not at work.
That would just be so...

13:39.277 --> 13:42.071
-Oh that'd be wrong.
-All right, what about Gerry?

13:42.071 --> 13:45.742
No! God, just a friend.
He's just my friend.

13:45.742 --> 13:50.079
Come on sweetie, there
must be somebody that
you'd like to take a run at.

13:50.079 --> 13:52.582
-[Trudy] Mmm.
-You guys want anything else?

13:52.582 --> 13:56.127
Um, yes. We would like
another round.

13:56.127 --> 13:58.004
And you think about your answer
while I'm gone.

13:58.004 --> 14:00.881
-[Lisa] I will think.
-[Bill] Okay.

14:00.881 --> 14:03.134
Sounds like you guys are
having a great time.

14:03.134 --> 14:06.763
Oh, I am so relieved,
she just hated me this morning.

14:06.763 --> 14:09.724
Well, I would like to think
that my charming service

14:09.724 --> 14:11.017
and delicious drinks helped.

14:11.017 --> 14:14.688
Oh, yeah, you're a big hit...
With Trudy.

14:14.688 --> 14:16.939
Just Trudy? Anybody else at
this table who thinks I'm great?

14:16.939 --> 14:18.733
-You know what?
I think there is.
-Is there?

14:18.733 --> 14:20.652
-Mmm-hmm.
-All right.

14:20.652 --> 14:22.445
He's picking up the drinks
right now.

14:22.445 --> 14:25.281
-Well played.
-[Lisa laughs]
I thought so, too.

14:25.281 --> 14:28.201
-All right.
-I'm on fire.

14:29.994 --> 14:32.955
[dance music playing]

14:34.874 --> 14:37.627
Hey. Where'd you get that?

14:37.627 --> 14:39.462
Oh, some guy just
threw it in my pocket.

14:39.462 --> 14:40.755
He said that's
what they do here.

14:40.755 --> 14:43.758
-Cool. Blend in.
-Blending in. Nice!

14:43.758 --> 14:46.177
Oh! Don't tap your foot
in the bathroom.

14:46.177 --> 14:48.596
-Sends the wrong message.
-Noted.

14:48.596 --> 14:52.517
Listen, Dwyer's in there,
I'm going to go in, get a dance.

14:52.517 --> 14:55.102
Take the mask off,
videotape it and we got it.

14:55.102 --> 14:59.106
Cool. And even if it's not
Dwyer, still had a fun night.

15:00.692 --> 15:03.152
-Wait here.
-Okay.

15:08.199 --> 15:10.993
[Manaconda] Have a seat,
handsome.

15:10.993 --> 15:13.287
And get ready to experience...

15:14.706 --> 15:17.792
The secrets of ancient Egypt.

15:17.792 --> 15:20.211
The secrets of the pyramids.

15:20.211 --> 15:23.381
Okay, yeah, yeah, I'm ready.
Blah, blah.

15:23.381 --> 15:26.967
[Manaconda] Are you ready
for the King Tut strut?

15:26.967 --> 15:30.471
Yeah, I'm ready Paul.
Like, are you really
continuing this? Seriously?

15:30.471 --> 15:33.140
-I'm Manaconda.
-Yeah and you know who I am, so.

15:33.140 --> 15:36.352
-Todd?
-No, what are you doing?

15:36.352 --> 15:39.397
-Give it up, I'm onto you.
-Ready for the dance?

15:39.397 --> 15:41.816
Yeah, I'm ready for the dance.
You're really committing
to this, aren't you?

15:41.816 --> 15:43.902
Are you ready to take it
to another level?

15:43.902 --> 15:46.529
Yeah, let's take it up, Paul,
let's do it down.

15:46.529 --> 15:48.782
When are you going to stop?
Okay, you're really? Okay.

15:48.782 --> 15:51.785
You know what? That's enough,
that's enough. Okay Paul.

15:51.785 --> 15:54.036
-I get it. All right, I get it.
-Excuse me?

15:54.036 --> 15:56.915
You're... [clears throat]

15:56.915 --> 16:01.252
-Lawrence!
-Simon!

16:01.252 --> 16:04.505
-Lawrence!
-Simon!

16:04.505 --> 16:06.800
Where is he? He's usually
pretty quick.

16:06.800 --> 16:08.885
I know, I just saw him out
there when I came in.

16:08.885 --> 16:11.011
-The guy with the striped shirt?
-Yeah. He was out front there.

16:11.011 --> 16:13.681
It's about time man!
Get this guy out of here.

16:13.681 --> 16:15.725
You don't need to wear a mask.
Look at you, you're beautiful.

16:15.725 --> 16:18.311
-I know I'm beautiful.
-Thank you.

16:22.482 --> 16:25.652
-[Simon]I knew it wasn't Dwyer.
-[Gerry] Shut up, Simon.

16:27.278 --> 16:30.030
[Simon] Bye, Manaconda.

16:35.286 --> 16:36.996
Did we win any
money this week?

16:36.996 --> 16:40.082
No, we didn't win anything
this week. But, not all is lost.

16:40.082 --> 16:42.251
I got this really funny
message from Gerry.

16:42.251 --> 16:44.545
Begging me to make sure I
got the money for the list.

16:44.545 --> 16:47.507
It was ridiculous, it went
on for, like, five minutes.

16:47.507 --> 16:50.885
-On and on, begging and...
-Does he know that we lost?

16:50.885 --> 16:53.053
-[Bobbi] No, not yet.
-All right, let's not tell him.

16:53.053 --> 16:56.015
Let's pretend we won the whole
thing, the jackpot.

16:56.015 --> 17:00.186
Oh, no, that's really mean,
I absolutely love it. Okay.

17:00.186 --> 17:03.564
Ah, okay. Oh! Five...

17:03.564 --> 17:07.318
Thirteen... 45...
Oh, my God!

17:07.318 --> 17:10.780
-[Callaghan] Oh!
-[Bobbi] We won you guys!
We won the lottery.

17:10.780 --> 17:13.366
I can't believe it!
I can't believe we won!

17:13.366 --> 17:16.703
-[Gerry cheers] We won!
-Thirty-five million dollars!

17:16.703 --> 17:18.872
-You got my message, right?
-No, I didn't get any message.

17:18.872 --> 17:22.208
I left a message, you got it!
You shut up, you got my message!

17:22.208 --> 17:24.752
-[Callaghan] No, oh no!
-[Gerry] Doesn't matter,
I was with Simon.

17:24.752 --> 17:27.296
-[Bobbi] We won!!
-[Gerry] No way!

17:27.296 --> 17:29.423
You've got to get
your money in, you'd be
a millionaire!

17:29.423 --> 17:32.176
-[Bobbi] Yeah, you have to put
your name on the list!
-We won? We won?

17:32.176 --> 17:34.261
-We won?
-Oh no, wait, hold on a second.

17:34.261 --> 17:36.347
-Finally. Yes!
-[Bobbi] Wayne, just hold on.

17:36.347 --> 17:39.308
-Finally, I quit you savages.
-[Bobbi] No... just...

17:39.308 --> 17:41.561
Sayonara suckers!

17:41.561 --> 17:45.189
No more gross Bobbi's voice
piercing my ears.

17:45.189 --> 17:48.442
No more Callaghan showing
up in my dreams at night.

17:48.442 --> 17:51.070
And you! The devil.

17:51.070 --> 17:55.992
No more weasel eyes piercing
through my skull.

17:55.992 --> 17:58.118
-[Bobbi] Wayne, Wayne! Wayne!
-[Leung] Your fat this and that.

17:58.118 --> 18:02.790
We were just playing a little
joke on Gerry, we didn't win
the lottery.

18:02.790 --> 18:04.834
[Bobbi] We didn't...

18:04.834 --> 18:08.922
[Gerry] What kind of joke is
that? And you were in on this?

18:08.922 --> 18:10.506
What are you doing?

18:12.341 --> 18:15.469
-What an idiot.
-[Bobbi] Oh, boy.

18:15.469 --> 18:18.222
-You think that's funny?
-Well, it was.

18:18.222 --> 18:20.808
-Well, that was funny.
-Gerry.

18:20.808 --> 18:23.770
I forgot to give Boobi your
money. I owe you five dollars.

18:27.314 --> 18:32.319
So I'm up five dollars,
you're all down five dollars,
so I'm the winner.

18:32.319 --> 18:33.863
Good meeting you Wayne.

18:36.532 --> 18:38.576
I hear there's an opening
in the library.

18:41.245 --> 18:42.789
I'd like to apply.

18:44.707 --> 18:48.294
Hey, Trudy, got you
a chai mocha latte,

18:48.294 --> 18:51.089
nonfat, no whip with sprinkles.

18:51.089 --> 18:54.216
Oh, thank you. What a nice
way to start a Monday.

18:54.216 --> 18:56.510
And this one is for you
to bring to Callaghan.

18:56.510 --> 19:00.014
[Lisa laughs nervously]

19:00.014 --> 19:02.141
It was a joke, this is for me.

19:02.141 --> 19:05.227
[Trudy laughs]
Isn't that a hoot?

19:05.227 --> 19:07.563
-[Lisa laughs] Yeah.
-Listen.

19:07.563 --> 19:10.149
I couldn't help but notice
that Bill was checking you out.

19:10.149 --> 19:13.569
Oh, well he checks out
everything with legs.

19:13.569 --> 19:17.865
-He's kind of a hound.
-Yeah, he's a smokin' hot hound.

19:17.865 --> 19:19.617
I'm just saying, I thought
it was interesting.

19:19.617 --> 19:23.162
Well, he's just not
really my type.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.873
Well, you know, sometimes the
one's that aren't your type

19:25.873 --> 19:28.876
-turn out to be the most fun.
-Yeah, I guess so.

19:28.876 --> 19:31.879
Hey, we should all
go out again soon...

19:31.879 --> 19:33.881
To Barrels, drinking.
I had a lot of fun.

19:33.881 --> 19:36.759
Yeah, let's do that again.
I'll tell you what,
I'll call you.

19:36.759 --> 19:39.345
-Really?
-Keep your phone
close by, turned on.

19:39.345 --> 19:41.514
I will, okay.
Enjoy your coffee.

19:41.514 --> 19:44.350
I will. Wow.

19:46.060 --> 19:49.063
-Gotta go to class.
-See you later.

19:49.063 --> 19:51.774
Gerry, what did you end up
doing this weekend?

19:53.359 --> 19:57.947
Uh, uh, I just got caught
up on stuff. That's all.

19:59.448 --> 20:01.951
-[Dwyer] Ahh!
-[Gerry] Oh.

20:01.951 --> 20:04.871
[Dwyer] Gotta loosen
it up a bit.

20:04.871 --> 20:06.998
-Hurt your back?
-Oh, yeah.

20:06.998 --> 20:09.625
-Okay, see you later.
-This is what I was
talking about.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.878
-Yeah.
-[Dwyer] That's what my
students were talking about.

20:11.878 --> 20:15.214
[Dwyer laughs]

20:16.465 --> 20:19.343
[Dwyer] Let me take it easy.

20:19.343 --> 20:21.721
You know, he did look like
Manaconda from this angle.

20:21.721 --> 20:24.015
From this angle, he looked
a lot like Manaconda.

20:30.771 --> 20:33.691
Mr. Duncan, I have never had any
problems with Stephan at home.

20:33.691 --> 20:36.777
He's really advanced, he started
walking at eight months.

20:36.777 --> 20:38.946
Well now he's 12 and everybody
in the school can walk.

20:38.946 --> 20:42.200
So, now I just have to get him
to pay attention when he's in...

20:42.200 --> 20:45.327
-Class. What are you doing?
-I saw you at Woody's on Friday.

20:45.327 --> 20:47.413
Okay, I'm talking to a parent
right now, Norman.

20:47.413 --> 20:49.999
I gotta go. We can just
finish this later on.

20:49.999 --> 20:52.292
Pretty crazy place. Huh, Gerry?

20:52.292 --> 20:53.920
Look, I thought I had a friend
there, that I knew.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.504
So that's why...
It was a mistake.

20:55.504 --> 20:57.173
Oh, you thought you knew
somebody.

20:57.173 --> 20:58.716
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Yes.

20:58.716 --> 21:01.385
That's how it starts Gerry.
That's how it starts.

21:01.385 --> 21:04.263
Bouncer, bartender, door guys.

21:04.263 --> 21:08.184
Cowboys with six shooters.
Pow, pow.

21:08.184 --> 21:10.561
Wednesday's hump day.
See you there, Gerry.

21:10.561 --> 21:13.147
No, you won't.

21:13.147 --> 21:16.817
Oh, sorry, George.
Hey, guys.

21:16.817 --> 21:18.819
I will.

21:18.819 --> 21:21.781
♪ Awesome, awesome
awesome, awesome ♪
