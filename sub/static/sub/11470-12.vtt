00:01.800 --> 00:03.484
<i>Previously on</i> Manhattan...

00:03.560 --> 00:05.324
I gave you the velocity distribution problem

00:05.440 --> 00:08.170
because I think you're the only man
here who's capable of solving it.

00:08.360 --> 00:10.806
You are a once-in-a-generation mind.

00:11.080 --> 00:13.845
There's a problem with Thin Man.
So what are we gonna do about it?

00:13.920 --> 00:17.447
The plan is to prove implosion
works before the plutonium arrives.

00:17.520 --> 00:19.249
To put everybody around you in jeopardy?

00:19.320 --> 00:20.526
Sorry to hear about Glen.

00:20.600 --> 00:22.807
Went to go do admin
work for Oppenheimer?

00:22.880 --> 00:25.167
Helen, there's something I need to ask you.

00:25.240 --> 00:26.480
Oh, shit.

00:26.640 --> 00:28.005
Are you...

00:29.400 --> 00:31.607
- This is just work.
- Of course it is.

00:31.680 --> 00:34.524
I need you to put some papers
into their house.

00:34.600 --> 00:36.762
To make it look like Lancefield hid them.

00:36.840 --> 00:38.444
I don't even know who I'm talking to.

00:39.080 --> 00:41.970
<i>So you're framing them for something.</i>

00:43.520 --> 00:45.887
Dr. Akley. I apologize.

00:45.960 --> 00:48.167
It's about a problem we've been
working on in implosion.

00:48.240 --> 00:50.766
Implosion is Frank Winter country
and the border is closed.

00:50.880 --> 00:52.609
I believe your border is wide open.

Christ.

01:23.200 --> 01:24.770
You spooked me.

01:25.600 --> 01:27.284
I thought everyone
had cleared out for the night.

01:27.360 --> 01:29.727
"Boldly they rode and well,

01:31.000 --> 01:32.968
"Into the jaws of Death,

01:34.560 --> 01:36.403
"Into the mouth of Hell."

01:36.960 --> 01:38.644
You know that one?

01:39.600 --> 01:40.806
No, sir.

01:42.280 --> 01:46.080
Will you let me know
if you see anything out of the ordinary?

01:47.000 --> 01:48.570
Nothing's amiss here.

01:50.080 --> 01:51.605
Thank you, Edgar.

03:01.280 --> 03:03.408
Reed.
What time is it?

03:07.920 --> 03:10.571
It's late as far as the javelina are concerned.

03:14.520 --> 03:16.602
You're in the doghouse, huh?

03:17.320 --> 03:18.765
I warned you.

03:19.280 --> 03:21.408
Secrets have a way of coming out.

03:24.400 --> 03:25.481
Get dressed.

03:26.920 --> 03:28.809
We're going for a drive.

04:25.680 --> 04:28.524
I wouldn't know a javelina
if it ran right past me.

04:28.640 --> 04:31.325
It won't.
They can sniff you out from 100 yards.

04:31.800 --> 04:33.882
So how are we supposed to shoot one?

04:34.000 --> 04:36.367
We're not shooting wild pigs, Charlie.

04:36.440 --> 04:39.364
They taste like shit and they look
too ugly to put on a wall.

04:45.320 --> 04:46.731
Dr. Akley?

04:46.840 --> 04:50.083
A combat historian I know
found out a fascinating detail

04:50.160 --> 04:52.367
about our American G.I.s on the front line.

04:52.760 --> 04:53.921
Is that right?

04:54.000 --> 04:57.163
We're fighting an army
convinced it is a master race

04:57.480 --> 04:59.528
destined to dominate all of mankind,

04:59.600 --> 05:02.922
an army that puts your women
and children in concentration camps.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.525
But do you know

05:05.800 --> 05:08.929
what four in five of our soldiers do

05:09.000 --> 05:11.890
when given the chance to fire
at these wretched people?

05:12.560 --> 05:14.483
They intentionally miss.

05:14.680 --> 05:17.684
80% of our soldiers

05:18.120 --> 05:22.489
can't bear the idea of shooting someone,
even their worst enemy.

05:23.200 --> 05:24.804
I doubt I'd be able to.

05:26.200 --> 05:28.521
And yet you shot me in the back.

05:31.040 --> 05:32.121
Sir,

05:33.000 --> 05:34.729
whatever you heard...

05:35.200 --> 05:38.886
Charlie, you know how long
we've been working on the gun model?

05:40.240 --> 05:41.287
Almost a year.

05:41.440 --> 05:42.646
Seven hundred years.

05:42.720 --> 05:45.644
The Chinese invented
firearms in the 13th century.

05:45.720 --> 05:47.370
We've been refining them ever since.

05:47.440 --> 05:49.841
Thin Man is just the next evolutionary stage,

05:49.920 --> 05:52.446
so why are you trying to sabotage her?

05:53.960 --> 05:55.086
Sir,

05:55.560 --> 05:58.245
Thin Man was never gonna work.

05:59.720 --> 06:02.724
With the plutonium that
they are making at Site X,

06:02.840 --> 06:04.410
Thin Man will predetonate.

06:04.560 --> 06:06.767
The spontaneous fission rate is too high.

06:06.920 --> 06:09.400
- That might be true.
- No, sir, it is true.

06:10.080 --> 06:12.890
But, Charlie, we're not
using the plutonium at Site X.

06:12.960 --> 06:14.485
I was there. I saw the factory.

06:14.600 --> 06:17.490
What you saw at Site X was a pilot plant
designed to work out the kinks.

06:17.600 --> 06:19.090
I wasn't in Washington, D.C. this week.

06:19.200 --> 06:21.965
I was in Washington State
touring the new reactor

06:22.080 --> 06:24.242
that will make
the weapons-grade plutonium.

06:24.800 --> 06:26.609
The Army calls it Site W.

06:27.160 --> 06:30.209
But why would we think that
their plutonium would be any cleaner?

06:30.280 --> 06:32.886
Because Enrico Fermi
personally designed the reactor.

06:33.160 --> 06:35.049
I have the fission rates on my desk.

06:35.160 --> 06:38.004
It's as good as cyclotron plutonium.
It's as good as pure.

06:38.760 --> 06:40.683
You've been manipulated

06:40.920 --> 06:43.287
by a brilliant but misguided man.

06:43.840 --> 06:47.925
Frank Winter is using you
to destroy Thin Man.

06:49.040 --> 06:51.691
Did Frank know about Site W?

06:51.760 --> 06:54.604
He has the same security clearance
as I do, at least for now.

06:55.400 --> 06:56.731
But why wouldn't he have told me?

06:56.800 --> 07:02.489
Charlie, I don't care if implosion
wins this war or Thin Man.

07:03.560 --> 07:06.370
I don't care if Hitler swallows a shotgun!

07:07.160 --> 07:11.210
Every man on this Hill
is fighting the same war

07:11.280 --> 07:15.330
except Frank, who's too busy
fighting for his own place in history!

07:15.480 --> 07:19.963
Tell me, whose idea was it
to hijack Thin Man in the first place?

07:20.800 --> 07:24.282
Whose idea to try and dupe
the most powerful army in the world?

07:24.360 --> 07:26.203
- Yours?
- No.

07:27.040 --> 07:29.247
Was it Frank's brilliant idea
to send Helen Prins over

07:29.320 --> 07:31.891
- to spy on Thin Man as well?
- She wasn't involved.

07:32.320 --> 07:35.324
Frank's had you on her strings
since the minute you got here.

07:36.840 --> 07:39.161
He used her to squeeze
the plutonium out of you.

07:39.560 --> 07:42.006
He sent her to Site X in order to tempt you.

07:42.560 --> 07:45.006
What about Tom Lancefield?
Is he mixed up in all this?

07:50.680 --> 07:52.091
Lancefield found out.

07:53.800 --> 07:55.689
Frank said we had to get rid of him.

07:58.520 --> 08:00.045
Jesus, Charlie.

08:01.480 --> 08:03.960
Sir, I am so sorry.

08:09.040 --> 08:10.371
It's okay.

08:12.440 --> 08:13.771
It's okay.

08:15.800 --> 08:18.804
Right now, we have to figure out
a way to keep you safe.

08:20.120 --> 08:22.521
Last night,
I pulled every requisition

08:22.600 --> 08:24.648
that's come out of my office
in the last two months.

08:24.720 --> 08:28.611
Every order co-opting our resources
for use on implosion.

08:28.680 --> 08:31.445
Your signature is on all of them.
Plain as day.

08:32.440 --> 08:33.726
Jesus.

08:33.919 --> 08:36.491
The Army uses the same ammo
for decent, misguided men

08:36.559 --> 08:37.890
as it does for spies.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.162
You're implicated in a conspiracy

08:41.240 --> 08:45.802
to sabotage the most expensive and
the most secret project in military history.

08:45.920 --> 08:50.050
And if it comes out, you're the only one
that it will trace back to.

08:50.440 --> 08:51.965
And meanwhile,

08:52.280 --> 08:55.602
the man who's truly responsible for all this
could get away soot-free.

09:50.720 --> 09:55.044
How long does it take Dr. Oppenheimer
to walk 300 feet from his office?

09:58.120 --> 09:59.167
Where is he?

09:59.520 --> 10:02.649
Well, they have central AC
and no dust storms at the White House,

10:02.720 --> 10:05.883
so you can hardly blame
the man for extending his stay.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.331
Don't worry.

10:07.400 --> 10:09.004
I'll take notes.

10:09.480 --> 10:12.723
Gentlemen, we've just gotten word
that more than a gram of plutonium

10:12.840 --> 10:16.128
will be shipping imminently
from the graphite reactor at Site X.

10:16.200 --> 10:17.201
How imminently?

10:17.280 --> 10:18.520
Within a week.

10:18.840 --> 10:21.889
Well, don't forget the postal service
doesn't deliver on Sundays.

10:23.400 --> 10:27.246
Solid plutonium buttons will be traveling
by train in a sealed titanium case.

10:27.320 --> 10:28.651
Carried by whom?

10:29.160 --> 10:31.527
That's need-to-know information.

10:31.960 --> 10:33.769
The last time we shipped plutonium,

10:33.840 --> 10:37.481
a sweaty-palmed junior professor
nearly got himself killed at a truck stop,

10:37.560 --> 10:40.006
so forgive me if I'd like
a little background on the person

10:40.080 --> 10:43.641
we're entrusting with 100 times as much
of the scarcest resource on the planet.

10:45.360 --> 10:48.489
He's a heavily-armed lieutenant in
Tennessee's 5th Ranger Battalion,

10:48.840 --> 10:51.241
the most combat-ready unit
in the United States Army.

10:51.600 --> 10:53.045
That good enough for you?

10:54.280 --> 10:58.968
The train from Knoxville to Santa Fe
takes 34 and a quarter hours.

10:59.160 --> 11:02.721
Two-thirds of the 50 stops
appear on every world map.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.604
And do you know where
the highest concentrations

11:04.680 --> 11:07.001
of German nationals in
this country happen to live?

11:07.080 --> 11:09.048
The Santa Fe Railroad sold them

11:09.120 --> 11:12.044
a few hundred thousand acres
of farmland at the turn of the century.

11:12.680 --> 11:16.401
We need soldiers in
army trucks, aerial support.

11:16.480 --> 11:20.610
We need a convoy that can protect itself
in case it falls under enemy attack.

11:20.680 --> 11:23.365
That operation will delay
the shipment by weeks.

11:24.120 --> 11:28.762
If we fumble this ball,
we won't be looking at delays.

11:28.880 --> 11:30.723
The game will be over.

11:31.600 --> 11:32.726
Glen?

11:34.640 --> 11:36.404
It's a reasonable point.

11:36.920 --> 11:39.161
This week, I found out
that a subordinate of mine

11:39.240 --> 11:42.323
was stealing Thin Man secrets
from under my nose, a man that I trusted.

11:42.400 --> 11:47.930
Now imagine if a traitor like Tom Lancefield
were to catch wind of our shipping plans.

11:48.720 --> 11:51.929
Now I think that it's time
that we all faced reality.

11:52.880 --> 11:54.882
There are spies on this Hill.

12:02.520 --> 12:04.090
Helen, I'm busy.

12:05.280 --> 12:06.441
With what?

12:09.640 --> 12:11.768
- Not now.
- Okay, when?

12:13.960 --> 12:15.086
Dr. Prins.

12:15.520 --> 12:17.682
Just the physicist I wanted to see.

12:24.880 --> 12:26.644
How was your trip, sir?

12:28.720 --> 12:30.802
I wanna tell you something, Helen.

12:31.400 --> 12:35.007
Whatever the reason that Charlie
recruited you into Thin Man,

12:35.080 --> 12:36.969
I'm lucky to have you on my team.

12:37.480 --> 12:38.481
Oh...

12:38.880 --> 12:41.645
Thank you, sir. I'm so glad to be here.

12:45.840 --> 12:47.763
You ever hear that old song,

12:47.880 --> 12:50.406
<i>I'm Gonna Dance Wit De Guy Wot Brung Me?</i>

12:52.480 --> 12:53.481
No.

12:56.280 --> 12:58.851
I know that Frank brought you to this dance,

12:58.920 --> 13:01.605
and I know you feel loyal to him.

13:02.560 --> 13:04.961
For whatever reason,
he inspires that in people.

13:05.040 --> 13:07.281
Oh, sir, I'm very grateful.

13:07.360 --> 13:09.010
He inspired it in me.

13:09.240 --> 13:12.403
Did you know that Frank gave me
my first job out of graduate school?

13:12.520 --> 13:15.922
- Really?
- Even back then, he had a unique mind.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.082
He was brilliant. He was iconoclastic.

13:18.160 --> 13:20.049
I looked up to him.

13:22.880 --> 13:25.281
And then he picked a squabble
with the department chair,

13:25.360 --> 13:27.727
and, uh, I leapt to his defense and

13:28.680 --> 13:32.480
next thing I know, Frank's AWOL
and I'm left flapping in the Chicago wind.

13:32.560 --> 13:35.530
It taught me a valuable
lesson about politics.

13:36.240 --> 13:38.004
And about Frank.

13:39.400 --> 13:42.085
Well, he's not the easiest guy to work with.

13:42.800 --> 13:45.724
Great men are not always good men.

13:49.680 --> 13:50.966
There's a storm coming.

13:51.040 --> 13:53.771
Now, Charlie won't admit it,

13:55.680 --> 13:57.808
but I think you're involved in this mess.

13:58.920 --> 14:00.570
I'm gonna protect Charlie.

14:01.480 --> 14:03.130
I'd like to protect you.

14:03.520 --> 14:06.490
But I can't help you unless
I know that I can trust you.

14:07.240 --> 14:09.242
Let me ask you something.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.571
Did you even know
what you were getting involved in?

14:18.200 --> 14:20.521
Sir, I was coerced.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.401
<i>Speeches will be limited to five minutes</i>

14:28.480 --> 14:31.962
<i>so that we may hear from as
many candidates as possible.</i>

14:44.920 --> 14:46.843
Well, she has got my vote.

14:48.080 --> 14:49.809
- Who does?
- Mrs. Winter.

14:50.240 --> 14:53.130
It's about time we had
a fresh face on the town council.

14:53.760 --> 14:56.127
Colonel's gonna wish he were
back in the Solomon Islands.

14:56.200 --> 14:57.531
Do you think you could
get me a meeting with her?

14:57.600 --> 14:59.602
I have a few issues
I'd like to talk to her about.

14:59.760 --> 15:02.331
The new George Zucco
picture came out in November,

15:02.400 --> 15:04.448
and they still haven't
shown it in the theater here.

15:04.520 --> 15:07.922
Oh, and Jeannie is very concerned
about the curfew in the women's dorm.

15:08.040 --> 15:09.644
Whoa, whoa. Hey, Frank.

15:11.600 --> 15:12.806
Where is everybody?

15:12.960 --> 15:15.327
I'm starting to feel like the 10th little Indian.

15:16.800 --> 15:17.961
No idea.

15:18.120 --> 15:21.010
Well, if this were a movie,
one of us would be the killer.

15:21.640 --> 15:23.290
Frank!

15:26.520 --> 15:27.931
It doesn't make any sense.

15:28.480 --> 15:30.642
Charlie has as much to lose as we do. More.

15:31.120 --> 15:33.885
I don't know if he told Akley
or if somebody else did,

15:34.360 --> 15:35.646
but Akley knows.

15:36.280 --> 15:39.329
He's got Charlie in his corner,
he now thinks he has me.

15:39.640 --> 15:42.325
He's lining you up
to take the fall for everything.

15:43.120 --> 15:45.691
Let's get ahead of this.
We'll sound the alarm on Thin Man.

15:45.760 --> 15:47.000
No, we need proof.

15:47.280 --> 15:50.762
Well, we'll show them that
Baritol can vary the burn rates

15:50.840 --> 15:52.126
and how to consolidate the shock waves.

15:52.240 --> 15:54.971
It's just a theory.
We need a gram of plutonium from Site X

15:55.040 --> 15:57.725
to prove Thin Man won't work
and implosion will.

15:57.800 --> 15:58.881
I know some people at Site X.

15:58.960 --> 16:00.769
I could probably get them
to rush the shipment.

16:00.840 --> 16:02.444
You don't have the authority for that.

16:02.520 --> 16:05.490
I'll just tell them I'm acting
on Akley's orders.

16:05.960 --> 16:07.166
You lie to the Army,

16:07.240 --> 16:10.005
it won't make a difference
what the testing shows.

16:10.080 --> 16:12.845
You'll be damaged goods
for the rest of this war.

16:13.800 --> 16:15.370
Gertrude.

16:18.800 --> 16:20.131
Gertrude.

16:22.040 --> 16:24.042
Is the Colonel here, yet?

16:24.520 --> 16:26.010
<i>Shall I show you how to</i>

16:26.080 --> 16:28.082
<i>use the intercom again, Mr. Babbit?</i>

16:28.400 --> 16:32.041
I think Heinrich Himmler loves me
more than this intercom.

16:33.360 --> 16:34.521
Gertrude.

16:35.520 --> 16:36.726
Gertrude.

16:38.280 --> 16:39.566
<i>Sir, you have a visitor.</i>

16:39.720 --> 16:41.245
Send the Colonel in.

16:47.640 --> 16:50.041
Never was one for fruit salad
on my dress shirts.

16:50.560 --> 16:52.324
Or marching for that matter.

16:52.400 --> 16:54.846
Sorry, I won't be but a minute.

16:55.080 --> 16:56.161
Paul.

16:58.360 --> 17:01.330
I heard they moved you in
with Oppenheimer's rock collection.

17:01.720 --> 17:04.963
How do calcite and pyrite
fare as office mates?

17:06.160 --> 17:08.481
They're quieter than the janitorial staff.

17:13.480 --> 17:15.482
Glen, I need a transfer.

17:17.319 --> 17:21.483
I can supervise production in Site X.
Or I can man one of the teams in Manhattan.

17:21.880 --> 17:24.884
I thought you were committed to implosion.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.082
Whoever we once worked for,

17:27.400 --> 17:29.402
Frank has become someone else.

17:30.520 --> 17:31.521
What happened?

17:31.600 --> 17:34.171
I accepted his demands.
I put my complete faith in him.

17:34.360 --> 17:37.364
And what do I get in return? I'm made a fool.

17:37.520 --> 17:40.569
He trusted Helen.
He even trusted Charlie Isaacs.

17:41.120 --> 17:42.406
But not me.

17:42.960 --> 17:44.610
You're not the only one.

17:44.680 --> 17:46.284
He didn't tell you, either?

17:48.560 --> 17:51.723
You know, I thought
maybe that's why you left.

17:52.480 --> 17:54.608
You brought him here in the first place.

17:55.120 --> 17:57.043
And this is how he repays you.

17:59.880 --> 18:01.882
I'll see what I can do about the transfer.

18:01.960 --> 18:04.440
That bastard Akley won't have me, either.

18:06.840 --> 18:09.207
No good deed on this Hill goes unpunished.

18:09.280 --> 18:11.248
I even had the gall to say
that I can't be trusted.

18:11.360 --> 18:12.885
Even after I...

18:13.360 --> 18:14.486
Even after you what?

18:14.600 --> 18:16.887
Even after I told him the truth

18:18.560 --> 18:20.164
about Frank and Isaacs.

18:20.720 --> 18:21.881
You told Akley?

18:24.640 --> 18:26.802
What does Isaacs have that I don't?

18:37.000 --> 18:39.162
- Switchboard.
- I need an outside line.

18:39.240 --> 18:40.924
Washington, DC. The White House.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.684
I need to speak to Robert Oppenheimer.

18:42.840 --> 18:45.207
<i>- Identification number?</i>
- G-11 .

18:45.520 --> 18:46.646
<i>One moment.</i>

18:50.240 --> 18:52.004
<i>The call could not be completed.</i>

18:52.480 --> 18:55.165
Then put me through to
the Pentagon switchboard.

18:55.240 --> 18:57.925
<i>Sir, you do not have
authorization to call off the Hill.</i>

18:58.000 --> 19:01.800
That's ridiculous. G-11.
I've got tier one security clearance.

19:01.960 --> 19:04.850
<i>I'm sorry, your clearance
has been downgraded.</i>

19:04.920 --> 19:07.526
What? By whose order?

19:07.640 --> 19:10.689
<i>I do not have authorization
to share that information.</i>

19:17.440 --> 19:22.480
<i>To ensure a wider representation
among our rapidly expanding population,</i>

19:22.560 --> 19:27.566
<i>the town council has seen fit
to expand our ranks for the coming term.</i>

19:27.800 --> 19:30.883
<i>Today we'll be hearing
from several candidates.</i>

19:30.960 --> 19:32.200
<i>Mr. Epstein.</i>

19:36.720 --> 19:38.722
<i>Friends, neighbors,</i>

19:39.400 --> 19:42.688
<i>our way of life on this
happy Hill is under attack.</i>

19:43.400 --> 19:45.721
<i>And we all know who is to blame.</i>

19:45.960 --> 19:47.371
<i>Dairy cows.</i>

19:47.600 --> 19:50.365
<i>That's why all our milk
tastes like sagebrush.</i>

19:50.720 --> 19:53.883
<i>Maybe if President Roosevelt
had a baby to feed, he'd realize...</i>

19:53.960 --> 19:56.406
<i>I was bird-watching. I wasn't lurking.</i>

19:56.760 --> 20:00.401
<i>And for my opponent to suggest
that I'm some kind of Peeping Tom</i>

20:00.480 --> 20:03.211
<i>is, frankly, outrageous.</i>

20:14.760 --> 20:18.242
Glen, how's it feel to finally be able
to move freely between buildings?

20:18.360 --> 20:21.250
Can we review your concept
on the plan we discussed?

20:22.880 --> 20:25.247
The, eh, plutonium transport.

20:25.520 --> 20:27.409
I think we can strong-arm the Army

20:27.480 --> 20:30.211
into releasing a convoy in the next few days.

20:30.600 --> 20:32.887
Leave those with my girl. I'll get back to you.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.970
Honestly, Glen, I don't think that
what we discussed is sufficient.

20:36.120 --> 20:38.282
We have to consider
more extreme measures.

20:38.440 --> 20:41.330
Even if it means pushing
the delivery back a few more weeks.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.048
<i>And finally we have Mrs...</i>

20:50.120 --> 20:53.283
<i>Excuse me, Dr. Liza Winter.</i>

21:07.040 --> 21:08.246
<i>Hello.</i>

21:10.520 --> 21:13.888
<i>Some of you may know me
from my work at the medical clinic.</i>

21:14.240 --> 21:17.244
<i>Or as the wife of one of
the group heads in the tech area.</i>

21:19.240 --> 21:23.370
<i>But I suspect I am best known for
throwing a tantrum in the military offices</i>

21:23.480 --> 21:26.848
<i>and an unauthorized
bonfire in my own backyard.</i>

21:29.840 --> 21:30.966
<i>You see,</i>

21:32.720 --> 21:34.324
<i>I have a condition.</i>

21:35.240 --> 21:37.686
<i>Don't worry, it's not contagious.</i>

21:38.320 --> 21:42.370
<i>My doctor tells me that
I have a neurotic character.</i>

21:43.520 --> 21:46.524
<i>Which, when properly medicated,
as it is now,</i>

21:46.600 --> 21:49.683
<i>is no more neurotic
than any other in this room.</i>

21:50.880 --> 21:55.886
<i>And now I can see that you are wondering
why I'm sharing this information with you.</i>

21:59.120 --> 22:02.841
<i>I don't believe in keeping secrets anymore.</i>

22:04.880 --> 22:08.885
<i>You see, I've lived on this Hill
for over a year, and I've been watching</i>

22:09.000 --> 22:12.482
<i>how the Army deploys information control</i>

22:14.080 --> 22:16.731
<i>to erode our community.</i>

22:18.040 --> 22:19.246
<i>Colonel,</i>

22:19.560 --> 22:22.245
<i>you have packed 4,000 civilians</i>

22:22.960 --> 22:25.691
<i>into an army base zoned for 400.</i>

22:25.800 --> 22:29.566
<i>You have asked us to live
without bathtubs and stoves,</i>

22:30.080 --> 22:32.970
<i>reliable electricity, fresh produce,</i>

22:33.080 --> 22:34.570
<i>and that's fine.</i>

22:34.640 --> 22:36.005
<i>I think we all agree</i>

22:36.080 --> 22:39.323
<i>we're happy to make those sacrifices
of modern conveniences</i>

22:39.400 --> 22:41.243
<i>if it's gonna help us win this war.</i>

22:41.480 --> 22:43.847
<i>But our boys overseas, they are fighting</i>

22:44.200 --> 22:48.410
<i>and they are dying
to defend our constitutional rights.</i>

22:49.520 --> 22:51.887
<i>Now is the time for someone to explain</i>

22:51.960 --> 22:55.931
<i>precisely what rights we have
when we live within these fences</i>

22:56.080 --> 23:00.290
<i>and what recourse we have if we feel
those rights have been abridged.</i>

23:00.760 --> 23:07.086
<i>I believe that the war for American values
is being waged right here on this Hill.</i>

23:07.720 --> 23:09.722
<i>I believe transparency</i>

23:10.440 --> 23:13.603
<i>is the lifeblood of democracy.</i>

23:16.280 --> 23:18.282
<i>I'm asking for your vote.</i>

23:22.400 --> 23:24.846
You and your wife in the same day.

23:24.920 --> 23:26.081
Lucky me.

23:26.160 --> 23:29.369
Site X was supposed to be
shipping the plutonium this month.

23:29.800 --> 23:32.087
I need you to tell me
when it's scheduled to arrive.

23:32.160 --> 23:34.288
You don't have the clearance
for that information anymore.

23:34.360 --> 23:36.408
Then get Secretary Stimson on the phone.

23:36.480 --> 23:38.801
It was his office that
downgraded your clearance.

23:38.880 --> 23:42.726
Apparently you pissed on the wrong
fire hydrant this time, Dr. Winter.

23:44.760 --> 23:48.321
I know that plutonium is ready.
I talked to Tennessee weeks ago.

23:48.440 --> 23:49.487
I can't help you.

23:51.120 --> 23:52.360
Thin Man won't work.

23:54.040 --> 23:55.041
What?

23:55.640 --> 23:58.120
Twenty years from now,
every government on this planet

23:58.200 --> 24:00.487
will know how to design a bomb,

24:00.600 --> 24:03.001
but they won't be able to build it

24:03.080 --> 24:05.845
because purifying plutonium to a base level

24:06.120 --> 24:09.567
takes more manpower and resources
than building the pyramids.

24:10.040 --> 24:14.728
Thin Man needs fuel that's 100 times
more pure than even we can make.

24:15.520 --> 24:17.682
It is completely impossible.

24:20.240 --> 24:22.288
That's a troubling theory.

24:23.360 --> 24:27.888
Just as it was troubling to hear
your other 15 theories over the past year

24:28.000 --> 24:29.843
for why your model is better than Akley's.

24:29.960 --> 24:31.689
This isn't a theory.

24:32.160 --> 24:35.004
When the plutonium arrives, it will be a fact.

24:35.200 --> 24:36.929
Thin Man will predetonate.

24:42.120 --> 24:45.329
You're talking about work
that isn't yours, Frank.

24:45.560 --> 24:47.881
About a group that isn't yours.

24:48.880 --> 24:51.611
How did you come to know
something like that?

24:54.080 --> 24:55.570
I have it on good authority.

24:57.280 --> 25:01.410
No one knows the penalties for violating
compartmentalization better than you.

25:01.560 --> 25:04.291
G-2 has been in this office
almost every day asking me

25:04.360 --> 25:07.569
whether you or your friends
are Commies or spies.

25:07.720 --> 25:10.644
If you feel something needs to be reported,

25:10.760 --> 25:14.401
I suggest we get them in here
before you say another word.

25:32.760 --> 25:34.842
- Gertrude.
<i>- Yes, sir?</i>

25:36.040 --> 25:37.883
Get me an outside line.

25:48.920 --> 25:51.366
<i>A reminder. All residents are expected to</i>

25:51.440 --> 25:53.522
<i>make their best effort to conserve water.</i>

25:53.600 --> 25:56.285
<i>The military appreciates your cooperation.</i>

26:46.560 --> 26:47.766
Hello.

26:49.480 --> 26:50.447
Hello.

26:50.520 --> 26:53.444
I'm sorry, but I think this is my house.

26:54.480 --> 26:57.484
They told us we were taking over 128B.

26:58.520 --> 27:00.045
I'm Evelyn.

27:01.000 --> 27:03.480
My husband and I
just drove in from Berkeley.

27:04.040 --> 27:06.691
We're so relieved to finally be here.

27:08.760 --> 27:11.161
Looks like they left in kind of a hurry.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.365
What's wrong with you?

27:17.360 --> 27:18.361
Wake up.

27:25.840 --> 27:27.490
Damn it.

27:29.520 --> 27:34.082
He can split the atom,
but ask the man to tie a Half Windsor...

27:34.160 --> 27:35.161
Mmm.

27:37.880 --> 27:39.211
I can fix my own tie.

27:39.280 --> 27:41.806
You know, Elsa picked out
Albert's clothes for him

27:41.880 --> 27:43.723
until the day she died.

27:44.040 --> 27:47.249
Men like you shouldn't
waste your brains on apparel.

27:47.400 --> 27:48.561
Honey,

27:48.760 --> 27:50.171
I'm not Albert Einstein.

27:50.240 --> 27:51.287
No,

27:51.720 --> 27:53.768
he didn't liberate Europe.

27:54.880 --> 27:56.644
Can I ask you something?

27:57.200 --> 27:58.440
Anything.

27:58.960 --> 28:03.568
You know, General Eisenhower
might win this war without us.

28:04.800 --> 28:06.609
We might not even need the gadget.

28:06.680 --> 28:08.364
There's always the Japanese.

28:08.720 --> 28:10.882
Anyway, I was just thinking, um,

28:11.680 --> 28:13.762
maybe we should just go back to Chicago.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.490
Honey.

28:16.560 --> 28:18.801
You are sweet, but we both know

28:18.880 --> 28:22.726
they're going to call you to Washington,
and you can't refuse the President.

28:22.800 --> 28:26.247
Imagine all the dinner invitations.
I'm exhausted just thinking about it.

28:26.400 --> 28:28.289
- I don't know about that.

28:28.840 --> 28:31.366
I wish you weren't so modest,

28:31.480 --> 28:32.641
at least with me.

28:48.760 --> 28:50.125
Dr. Akley.

28:50.760 --> 28:52.524
There's a call for you.

28:53.840 --> 28:55.649
Director of Operations at Site X.

28:55.720 --> 28:58.724
He says he needs to speak
with you immediately.

29:07.200 --> 29:09.441
Mrs. Isaacs. ls he here?

29:16.640 --> 29:19.849
What the hell are you doing here?
Someone will see you.

29:21.680 --> 29:23.682
- Meet me at the armory in 30 minutes.
- Fine.

29:23.760 --> 29:25.569
You gonna leave me sitting on
my ass like you did yesterday?

29:25.640 --> 29:27.005
You need to leave.

29:28.840 --> 29:30.126
It's true.

29:31.160 --> 29:33.083
You've been listening to Akley.

29:33.160 --> 29:35.003
I've been listening to reason.

29:35.080 --> 29:36.605
- What did you tell him?
- Nothing.

29:36.680 --> 29:38.250
Nothing he didn't already know.

29:38.360 --> 29:39.361
Ch.

29:39.880 --> 29:41.962
I never should have knocked on your door.

29:42.040 --> 29:45.408
I guess Reed Akley's figured out
a way to rewrite the laws of physics.

29:45.480 --> 29:47.687
Prevent Thin Man
from blowing up in his face.

29:47.760 --> 29:50.525
Actually, he has.
It's a new reactor up in Washington.

29:50.640 --> 29:53.530
- I think you've heard of it.
- What, Site W plutonium?

29:53.960 --> 29:55.166
That's his magic bullet?

29:55.240 --> 29:58.210
The only thing Site W has
on Site X is a river view.

29:58.680 --> 30:00.125
A factory is a factory.

30:00.200 --> 30:02.328
They'll never make plutonium
Thin Man can use.

30:02.400 --> 30:05.722
- Akley told me you'd say that.
- Oh, Jesus. You can't trust him, Charlie.

30:05.840 --> 30:07.001
Oh, but I can trust you?

30:07.120 --> 30:08.804
Implosion works. We both know that.

30:08.920 --> 30:11.002
Implosion works in theory.

30:11.640 --> 30:14.769
You have no idea what we'll find out
when the plutonium arrives.

30:16.680 --> 30:18.045
Listen to me.

30:18.360 --> 30:21.762
Akley manipulated the Secretary
into suspending my security clearance.

30:21.880 --> 30:25.362
But you, you can push operations
to get that plutonium here immediately.

30:25.480 --> 30:26.606
Right.

30:26.880 --> 30:29.247
- Because it's always up to me.
- Wha...

30:29.320 --> 30:32.642
Every detonator, every requisition,
every inch of Primacord,

30:32.720 --> 30:35.200
they all trace back to me. Why is that?

30:35.280 --> 30:38.807
We're talking about winning a world war.
You're thinking about signatures on forms?

30:38.880 --> 30:41.611
- You set me up.
- God, I should have known it.

30:41.880 --> 30:45.441
I should have known you would fold
at the very first sign of resistance.

30:45.880 --> 30:47.803
Get the hell out of my house.

30:50.560 --> 30:52.005
Yeah, you're right.

30:52.560 --> 30:55.769
I should give you time
to say goodbye to your wife.

30:55.840 --> 30:58.320
'Cause when the Army
and G-2 find out about this,

30:58.400 --> 31:00.721
they'll be knocking on your door.

31:00.920 --> 31:02.809
But not for the first time, right, Charlie?

31:02.920 --> 31:03.921
You lied about Babbit.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.729
- You lied about Richard Lavro.
- You forced me to lie.

31:05.840 --> 31:06.841
Do you...

31:06.920 --> 31:08.968
Do you really think they'll care?

31:16.160 --> 31:17.571
You know what I think?

31:19.320 --> 31:22.608
You've compromised every
member of your group.

31:22.760 --> 31:24.250
You alienated your mentor.

31:24.920 --> 31:29.084
A year in this desert
has driven your wife insane.

31:30.280 --> 31:34.285
So your name has to be on the bomb
or you did it all for nothing.

31:35.920 --> 31:41.131
I am not gonna be the last casualty
of Frank Winter's ego.

32:01.320 --> 32:03.926
Abby, I don't know what you heard, but...

32:04.000 --> 32:05.570
I heard plenty.

32:07.040 --> 32:08.690
I made a mistake.

32:12.520 --> 32:14.648
I listened to the wrong man.

32:15.680 --> 32:19.287
Dr. Akley gave me an opportunity

32:19.360 --> 32:22.091
and I betrayed his trust.

32:22.280 --> 32:23.327
But,

32:25.080 --> 32:27.162
he's given me a second chance.

32:27.920 --> 32:29.160
A clean slate.

32:29.840 --> 32:32.081
There's no such thing as a clean slate.

32:32.600 --> 32:33.681
For any of us.

32:34.080 --> 32:35.320
There is.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.810
I lost my bearings for a little while, that's all.

32:40.800 --> 32:42.290
There's no difference.

32:43.320 --> 32:44.367
What?

32:45.680 --> 32:48.889
Between Frank Winter and Reed Akley.
That's not a choice.

32:49.360 --> 32:50.646
One tried to destroy our marriage,

32:50.720 --> 32:52.484
the other dragged us into
this trap in the first place.

32:52.560 --> 32:54.528
- I'm not sure which is worse.
- Abby.

32:54.680 --> 32:57.411
You are a pawn

32:57.480 --> 32:59.289
in some kind of political game.

32:59.360 --> 33:01.362
And you made me a pawn, too.

33:01.520 --> 33:04.490
I framed a man and his wife, my friend.
And for what?

33:04.600 --> 33:08.400
I told you, I listened to the
wrong person, but I'm fixing it.

33:08.480 --> 33:11.848
But the man I married had his own mind.
What happened to him?

33:14.560 --> 33:16.085
What happened to you?

33:17.800 --> 33:21.122
When was the last time that
you told me that you loved me?

33:21.720 --> 33:23.722
You barely touched me in months.

33:27.200 --> 33:29.009
I'm going home, Charlie.

33:29.120 --> 33:31.327
You can't. The Army won't allow it.

33:31.400 --> 33:34.529
I looked into it.
There's one way that they will.

33:35.720 --> 33:36.846
What Way?

33:40.320 --> 33:41.970
If we're divorced.

33:49.280 --> 33:52.887
The problem is that neither Clark Kent
nor Bruce Wayne has a sense of humor.

33:52.960 --> 33:55.645
I know their parents died,
and that's really sad, but...

33:55.760 --> 33:57.888
Honestly, even I get
tired of superhero orphans.

33:57.960 --> 33:59.246
Exactly.

33:59.320 --> 34:01.482
They should make a comic book about you.

34:01.600 --> 34:03.364
You already have an origin story, right?

34:03.440 --> 34:04.441
I do?

34:04.600 --> 34:06.682
- Remember how the Flash got his powers?
- Yeah.

34:06.760 --> 34:09.239
He inhaled heavy water vapors
in the laboratory.

34:09.440 --> 34:11.761
Didn't you inhale something, too?

34:13.480 --> 34:15.527
I do have an origin story.

34:28.440 --> 34:30.362
- Dr. Babbit?
- Sorry to interrupt.

34:31.600 --> 34:33.329
Oh, God, are you two...

34:34.280 --> 34:36.362
No. I need your help.

34:43.440 --> 34:46.967
There he is.
I've been looking over all your concerns.

34:47.040 --> 34:52.967
Now, our muzzle velocity
is 910 meters per second.

34:54.199 --> 34:58.569
Barrel pressure is sitting in the range
of 75,000 pounds per square inch.

34:58.640 --> 34:59.766
- But we can do better.
- Sir...

34:59.840 --> 35:03.481
If we extend the barrel, the plutonium
can reach a higher rate of speed,

35:03.560 --> 35:06.131
but there are only
two airplanes on the planet

35:06.200 --> 35:08.089
that can clear the ground
with an 8,000-pound bomb.

35:08.160 --> 35:10.640
- Neither can accommodate a longer barrel...
- Dr. Akley.

35:11.320 --> 35:14.005
- What is it?
- I can't continue on the project.

35:16.000 --> 35:18.002
I've thought long and hard.

35:20.200 --> 35:22.487
- Today is my last day.
- Charlie.

35:31.920 --> 35:34.127
- It's not accepted.
- Sir, I appreciate your generosity...

35:34.200 --> 35:37.044
My generosity is the only thing standing

35:37.120 --> 35:40.010
between you and a firing squad.

35:40.560 --> 35:42.164
Under the circumstances,

35:42.240 --> 35:45.244
I don't think two weeks notice
is a hell of a lot to ask.

35:45.320 --> 35:49.530
If you have to report me to Oppenheimer,
I understand, but I am done.

35:52.440 --> 35:53.521
Just like that?

35:55.040 --> 35:56.929
I wish I'd done it six months ago.

35:58.840 --> 36:02.606
What about our boys in uniform?
70,000 of them headed for Europe.

36:02.880 --> 36:06.441
- You don't care what happens to them?
- You'll have to finish without me.

36:07.320 --> 36:08.401
I can't.

36:10.880 --> 36:12.086
Charlie,

36:12.800 --> 36:15.849
we are gonna beat
Werner Heisenberg, the two of us.

36:16.720 --> 36:18.882
Why the hell do you think
I recruited you in the first place?

36:19.400 --> 36:21.687
<i>A New Approach to Nuclear Cosmology.</i>

36:22.200 --> 36:25.727
You changed the way
we think about the universe,

36:25.800 --> 36:28.929
the way we think about
the creation of the elements.

36:29.240 --> 36:31.402
You can fix Thin Man.

36:33.400 --> 36:35.164
I thought Thin Man wasn't broken.

36:36.120 --> 36:39.044
It's not. It just needs some modifications.

36:43.160 --> 36:44.366
You knew.

36:44.800 --> 36:46.040
What?

36:46.640 --> 36:49.769
You knew Thin Man was going to fail.

36:49.960 --> 36:51.803
Jesus, Charlie.

36:52.600 --> 36:55.410
- There's no certainties in nuclear science.
- You knew.

36:55.560 --> 36:57.767
You knew and you kept it a secret.

36:58.520 --> 37:01.603
The plutonium from Site W,
it's no different from Site X plutonium, is it?

37:01.680 --> 37:03.569
- Of course, it is.
- Prove it.

37:04.280 --> 37:05.281
Charlie...

37:05.360 --> 37:07.442
You said you had the fission rates
on your desk. Show them to me.

37:07.520 --> 37:10.842
Even if you had the clearance,
you have to trust me.

37:10.920 --> 37:12.365
I don't.

37:13.160 --> 37:16.289
Admit that you're lying
or I walk out that door.

37:19.120 --> 37:22.090
I can't fix this on my own.

37:22.160 --> 37:24.447
- But the two of us together...
- My God.

37:25.560 --> 37:27.847
Charlie, don't walk away from me
when I'm talking to you!

37:27.920 --> 37:30.161
Charlie, don't walk out that door!

37:39.400 --> 37:40.447
You're clear. Go ahead.

37:40.520 --> 37:44.081
Yeah. We're here to pick up
a delivery for Dr. Oppenheimer.

37:49.200 --> 37:50.247
Dr. Sinclair.

37:54.360 --> 37:56.362
Did you have any trouble
finding our little Hill?

37:56.840 --> 38:00.003
I had trouble finding a taxi in
Santa Fe that would pick up a negro.

38:00.680 --> 38:01.841
Is that all you brought?

38:02.520 --> 38:04.841
1.12 grams of plutonium.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.490
Plus every stitch of clothing I own.

38:06.840 --> 38:08.842
I left Tennessee as soon as you called.

38:09.320 --> 38:11.368
Where is Dr. Oppenheimer?

38:11.720 --> 38:14.690
Don't worry.
He'll catch wind of this soon enough.

38:14.760 --> 38:16.410
You said you were calling on his authority

38:16.520 --> 38:18.443
and that he would find me
a permanent position here.

38:18.520 --> 38:21.205
Dr. Sinclair, you have
a bright future on the Hill.

38:22.320 --> 38:24.004
And that makes one of us.

38:24.560 --> 38:26.369
Wait, what about me?

38:37.680 --> 38:39.330
Dr. Winter.

38:40.600 --> 38:43.524
- I hear they're making a movie.
- I'm sorry?

38:43.720 --> 38:47.645
A nervous-looking fellow was here.
He asked me to return that to you.

38:48.960 --> 38:50.450
Oh, thank you.

39:35.400 --> 39:37.129
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:39.800 --> 39:41.370
What you doing here?

39:42.120 --> 39:43.121
Um...

39:44.480 --> 39:46.448
I had nowhere else to go.

39:47.760 --> 39:50.206
I'm the one who told Frank
about you and Akley.

39:50.280 --> 39:51.441
I know.

39:56.800 --> 39:59.804
But you didn't tell Akley about me.

40:00.760 --> 40:03.604
I forced you into this in the first place.

40:04.560 --> 40:06.449
I made my own choices.

40:09.080 --> 40:10.764
What happens next?

40:11.560 --> 40:13.210
There is no next.

40:14.040 --> 40:17.283
In 24 hours, I'll be off this Hill
one way or the other.

40:24.680 --> 40:26.887
Do you have a place to sleep?

41:13.560 --> 41:14.800
Charlie.

41:25.640 --> 41:26.801
Frank.

41:38.960 --> 41:40.325
Did Isaacs send you?

41:42.080 --> 41:43.127
No.

41:45.520 --> 41:47.124
What do you want?

41:49.720 --> 41:52.291
The only thing that any of us wants.

41:53.840 --> 41:55.842
What do you want from me?

41:56.320 --> 41:57.651
Your help.

41:58.880 --> 42:00.211
With Thin Man.

42:04.600 --> 42:06.250
Thin Man is dead.

42:08.320 --> 42:10.721
Then we'll bring it back to life.

42:11.360 --> 42:13.169
You'll imagine a way.

42:14.920 --> 42:17.287
You did the best you could, Reed.

42:18.720 --> 42:20.768
But your bomb won't run on imagination.

42:25.840 --> 42:27.569
You don't have to do this.

42:28.680 --> 42:32.685
Just talk to Oppenheimer.
Tell him why the gun model won't work.

42:33.840 --> 42:37.686
By the time the plutonium gets here,
you will look like a goddamn hero.

42:38.280 --> 42:39.611
It's already here.

42:40.440 --> 42:42.090
<i>It's in the metallurgy lab.</i>

42:43.120 --> 42:45.521
<i>Oppenheimer's office arranged
an accelerated delivery.</i>

42:45.600 --> 42:48.524
<i>It appears you still have a friend on this Hill.</i>

42:51.400 --> 42:53.402
We both have blood on our hands.

42:54.840 --> 42:57.605
If the Army finds out what happened here,

42:58.320 --> 43:00.846
you and I are gonna end up
in the brig together.

43:02.880 --> 43:06.089
But not if we make a unified front.

43:09.280 --> 43:11.965
This project won't survive without us.

43:14.600 --> 43:16.807
So we talk to Robert tonight,

43:17.920 --> 43:19.206
together.

43:21.160 --> 43:23.811
We let him know that implosion
is the only way forward.

43:33.000 --> 43:34.684
You'd work with me?

43:35.640 --> 43:38.849
If it gets us there before the Germans,
I will work for you.

43:45.320 --> 43:47.926
Reed, in a few months,
this won't be about burn rates

43:48.000 --> 43:50.287
and shock waves and supercompression.

43:51.320 --> 43:54.608
It'll be about advising
the Army and the White House

43:54.680 --> 43:58.685
on how to use the most powerful weapon
in the history of mankind.

44:01.680 --> 44:06.208
And I think you and I both know
I don't belong in a room with the President.

44:09.040 --> 44:10.201
Come on.

44:11.200 --> 44:12.850
Let's go to the metallurgy lab.

44:13.640 --> 44:14.687
Frank.

44:18.160 --> 44:20.128
What would you have done

44:21.960 --> 44:24.486
if you thought that
implosion might not work?

44:26.400 --> 44:27.731
Let it go.

44:28.880 --> 44:31.963
Six months from now,
all anyone's gonna remember

44:33.520 --> 44:35.045
is that we built it.

45:04.120 --> 45:05.281
Reed!

45:07.920 --> 45:09.001
Reed!
