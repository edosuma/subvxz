"Edge City"

00:48.948 --> 00:50.867
Another one coming down.

00:50.908 --> 00:52.118
Hang on.

01:38.122 --> 01:41.959
THE MASK

01:53.638 --> 01:56.015
I got those...

01:56.099 --> 01:57.308
concert tickets you wanted.

01:57.391 --> 01:58.811
You're kidding!

01:58.894 --> 02:00.687
For Friday night?

02:00.771 --> 02:03.649
Stanley, this is great.

02:04.525 --> 02:06.317
What time do I pick you up?

02:06.401 --> 02:08.318
Here's the thing.

02:08.402 --> 02:12.115
My best girlfriend is here
and she'd die to go to this...

02:12.198 --> 02:14.952
so could we get an extra ticket
for her?

02:16.578 --> 02:20.332
They're sold out. That means
there's no more.

02:22.209 --> 02:24.585
I can't let her sit home all alone.

02:26.129 --> 02:28.632
I'll tell you what.

02:28.715 --> 02:30.175
Go with your friend.

02:31.009 --> 02:33.762
I couldn't do that.

02:33.846 --> 02:35.222
No, come on.

02:36.640 --> 02:38.850
Stanley, you are the nicest guy.

02:38.933 --> 02:41.018
Really, you are.

02:41.102 --> 02:44.940
- Isn't he the nicest guy?
- The best.

02:48.861 --> 02:51.697
That was the most sickening display

02:51.739 --> 02:55.284
- I've ever seen.
- I disagree.

02:55.367 --> 02:56.952
I'm wearing her down.

02:57.035 --> 03:00.331
Buddy, you need a little
change of pace.

03:00.415 --> 03:03.375
Tonight, I'll take you
on a love safari.

03:03.417 --> 03:06.879
Deep into the darkest heart
of the urban jungle.

03:06.962 --> 03:08.964
Tell me more, bwana.

03:09.047 --> 03:12.885
The Coco Bongo Club.
Hottest new joint in town.

03:12.926 --> 03:15.429
Only the crême de la crême
need apply.

03:16.722 --> 03:18.766
- How do we get in?
- Are you kidding?

03:18.849 --> 03:21.185
Leave it to me.
Trust me, buddy.

03:21.226 --> 03:23.479
This will be the perfect...

03:23.562 --> 03:25.898
night on the town.

03:38.411 --> 03:40.580
Hold the phone.

03:40.622 --> 03:43.792
Killer at three o'clock.

04:12.112 --> 04:14.907
Stand back and observe.

04:18.910 --> 04:20.411
Where do I open an account?

04:20.452 --> 04:22.247
New accounts,right here.

04:22.330 --> 04:24.790
You're lucky, I was on my way out--

04:24.873 --> 04:26.500
Hold this for me, please?

04:26.583 --> 04:28.795
I'll hold anything you want.

04:31.297 --> 04:33.258
Can you help me?

04:58.659 --> 05:00.077
So...

05:00.995 --> 05:03.329
what kind of account do you want?

05:03.413 --> 05:07.709
Well, I'm not sure exactly. I'm
just terrible with things like that.

05:08.710 --> 05:11.087
That's an interesting tie, Mister...

05:11.171 --> 05:13.549
Ipkiss, Stanley Ipkiss.

05:13.632 --> 05:15.217
Tina Carlyle, it's a pleasure.

05:15.301 --> 05:17.011
Pleasure's all mine.

05:17.678 --> 05:19.013
May l?

05:19.597 --> 05:20.431
What?

05:20.514 --> 05:22.349
I'm such a mess.

05:23.184 --> 05:25.018
Oh, of course.

05:26.436 --> 05:28.355
That's what they're there for.

05:30.983 --> 05:33.652
As I was saying, that tie...

05:33.736 --> 05:37.740
reminds me of those,
what do you call it, ink blot tests.

05:37.823 --> 05:40.743
- A Rorschach test.
- Right.

05:40.826 --> 05:42.995
It sort of looks like...

05:44.205 --> 05:45.915
a young woman riding bareback.

05:45.998 --> 05:48.000
Sort of...

05:48.084 --> 05:49.627
Lady Godiva or something.

05:51.045 --> 05:52.546
Of course.

05:52.630 --> 05:56.092
What do you see, Mr. Ipkiss?

05:58.302 --> 06:00.096
I don't know.

06:12.358 --> 06:14.111
Bright colors...

06:14.194 --> 06:15.695
It's a power tie.

06:15.779 --> 06:17.614
Supposed to make you feel...

06:17.697 --> 06:19.741
powerful.

06:19.825 --> 06:21.243
Does it work?

06:25.871 --> 06:29.542
Now, how about that account?

06:29.583 --> 06:30.751
We have...

06:30.835 --> 06:32.920
several different plans.

06:33.003 --> 06:34.296
Savings.

06:38.926 --> 06:39.927
Checking.

06:40.010 --> 06:41.554
Savings and checking.

06:41.637 --> 06:43.890
Savings and CD's.

06:43.974 --> 06:45.267
Checking and CD's.

06:45.350 --> 06:48.270
Savings, checking and CD's.
T-Bills.

06:48.311 --> 06:51.189
Or we can throw your money
in a big mattress.

06:56.695 --> 06:59.365
Now, I have some forms
for you to fill out.

07:05.786 --> 07:11.208
That's it, sweetheart.
Now just a little bit to the right.

07:11.292 --> 07:13.210
Keep it down back there.

07:14.755 --> 07:15.964
We'll try.

07:16.047 --> 07:19.217
- What do you think?
- Layout's not bad. But...

07:19.301 --> 07:22.179
the motion detectors are a pain.

07:22.262 --> 07:24.514
But you can pull this off, right?

07:24.598 --> 07:27.517
You talking to the Doctor.

07:27.601 --> 07:29.520
I do have one question.

07:29.604 --> 07:31.397
Which is?

07:31.481 --> 07:33.983
What's Niko have to say about this?

07:34.066 --> 07:35.609
Nothing.

07:36.693 --> 07:39.529
- This isn't his grift.
- Get real, man.

07:39.613 --> 07:41.490
Everything is his grift.

07:41.531 --> 07:45.786
He owns you, he owns this club,
he owns this whole stinking town.

07:45.869 --> 07:49.247
Things change.

07:49.331 --> 07:53.168
You mess with Niko, you end up
taking a dirt nap.

07:54.711 --> 07:57.005
He's the only one who's napping...

07:59.175 --> 08:01.844
and I'm about to give him
a serious wake-up call.

08:01.886 --> 08:04.013
But we need cash...

08:04.097 --> 08:06.349
so first we take the bank...

08:06.432 --> 08:07.892
then we take Niko...

08:07.975 --> 08:10.227
and then, my friend,
school is out.

08:11.394 --> 08:14.690
And this whole city is our playground.

08:20.780 --> 08:22.990
Bub, watch where you're going!

08:39.006 --> 08:40.174
Hang on, hang on!

08:41.551 --> 08:43.510
Don't get your panties in a twist.

08:43.592 --> 08:45.805
What the hell is it?

08:45.888 --> 08:48.015
I don't know...

08:48.099 --> 08:50.309
about seven hundred bucks, eh?

08:51.644 --> 08:54.105
Now, what can I do for you, bub?

08:54.188 --> 08:56.149
I'm here for the Civic.

08:56.232 --> 09:00.070
The brake drums are shot
and you need a new transmission.

09:00.112 --> 09:01.822
What?!

09:01.905 --> 09:03.906
All I wanted was an oil change.

09:03.990 --> 09:08.161
Lucky we caught these problems
before they caused serious trouble.

09:09.203 --> 09:12.123
Sign right here, and press down hard.

09:13.332 --> 09:15.793
- There's no price.
- There will be.

09:16.919 --> 09:19.380
I've no car.
I need a car tonight.

09:21.758 --> 09:23.885
Bring around the loaner.

09:23.968 --> 09:25.803
The loaner?

09:25.887 --> 09:27.972
The loaner?

09:57.335 --> 09:59.588
It's a classic.

10:10.349 --> 10:13.143
Gals, meet my buddy Stanley Ipkiss.

10:13.185 --> 10:16.606
Humungo in the banking business.

10:16.648 --> 10:18.817
- Not really.
- Let's get in this joint.

10:21.235 --> 10:23.862
How you doing, buddy?

10:23.945 --> 10:26.697
- It's Charlie!
- How you doing?

10:26.781 --> 10:29.326
- How you doing, my friend?
- Long time no see.

10:29.410 --> 10:31.995
Good to see you.

10:32.079 --> 10:33.831
Come on, gals.

10:33.914 --> 10:35.958
See you on the inside.

10:45.218 --> 10:47.303
This is a mistake.

10:50.265 --> 10:53.226
You crossed the rope.
Never cross the rope.

10:53.309 --> 10:56.437
- My friends are inside.
- Lose him.

10:56.520 --> 10:58.230
This isn't fair.

10:58.313 --> 10:59.566
Watch it, I'm a bleeder.

10:59.649 --> 11:02.819
Put me down now, or I am
never coming back here.

11:13.245 --> 11:15.206
Jeez.

11:29.052 --> 11:31.181
Mr. Ipkiss!

11:31.264 --> 11:32.974
Hi.

11:34.726 --> 11:35.894
Are you okay?

11:35.977 --> 11:37.562
Me?

11:37.645 --> 11:38.897
I'm great..

11:38.980 --> 11:39.898
Really good.

11:39.981 --> 11:42.233
I never felt better, really.

11:42.275 --> 11:44.319
I'm just...

11:44.402 --> 11:45.653
catching some air.

11:45.737 --> 11:47.572
Your car, sir.

11:48.573 --> 11:49.991
That's not my car.

11:50.075 --> 11:51.659
It matches the ticket.

11:55.663 --> 11:57.207
Alright...

11:57.248 --> 11:59.293
I'll take it.

12:00.460 --> 12:03.171
But I am very angry!

12:04.714 --> 12:06.257
Believe this?

12:07.425 --> 12:09.886
You drive in in a Porsche...

13:54.033 --> 13:55.534
Hey, Mister!

13:58.829 --> 14:00.207
Hold on!

14:01.208 --> 14:03.460
I know CPR!

14:41.415 --> 14:42.416
Hey, you!

14:42.457 --> 14:45.002
What are you doing down there?

14:46.878 --> 14:49.673
I'm just looking for...

14:51.007 --> 14:52.634
my mask!

14:53.844 --> 14:55.429
I got it.

15:04.397 --> 15:07.816
Do you have any idea what time it is?

15:07.899 --> 15:09.609
Actually, no.

15:11.736 --> 15:13.947
My new carpet!

15:14.030 --> 15:17.827
Well ,this is coming right out
of your security deposit.

15:18.785 --> 15:19.911
You know...

15:19.995 --> 15:21.121
What?

15:25.041 --> 15:26.042
Nothing.

15:26.126 --> 15:29.504
Well, that's what you are, Ipkiss,
a big nothing.

15:33.718 --> 15:37.638
Aren't you due at the lab
to get your bolts tightened?

15:39.307 --> 15:41.434
I should have said that.

15:48.775 --> 15:50.777
Hey, you.

15:50.860 --> 15:52.694
Milo!

15:52.778 --> 15:56.364
No jumping up allowed.
It's against doggie ordinance.

16:21.683 --> 16:22.851
What do you want?

16:22.935 --> 16:24.727
You want me to throw that?

16:24.811 --> 16:26.394
I'm very tired.

16:26.478 --> 16:29.231
I'll throw it one time.

16:29.314 --> 16:32.318
I won't throw it with you
attached to it.

16:35.947 --> 16:37.615
You ready?

16:37.698 --> 16:39.242
Get it.

16:39.325 --> 16:40.493
Ipkiss!

16:40.535 --> 16:42.829
Turn down those cartoons!

16:42.912 --> 16:45.374
Alright, Mrs. Peenman!

16:51.088 --> 16:54.174
Dr. Neuman, you say that everybody
wears a mask?

16:54.216 --> 16:55.968
That's correct.

16:56.051 --> 16:59.011
We all wear masks,
metaphorically speaking.

16:59.095 --> 17:02.099
We suppress the id,
our darkest desires...

17:02.182 --> 17:05.143
and adopt a more socially
acceptable image.

17:05.226 --> 17:09.480
The book is "The Masks We Wear"
by Dr. Arthur Neuman.

17:09.564 --> 17:11.315
Thank you for being here.

17:15.904 --> 17:17.698
What's the matter with you?

17:17.739 --> 17:18.906
What is it?

17:20.409 --> 17:22.243
What are you looking for?

17:22.327 --> 17:25.289
You like this thing? You like it?

17:26.790 --> 17:29.126
"The Masks We Wear".

17:32.087 --> 17:33.464
"That's correct.

17:33.547 --> 17:37.134
We all wear masks,
metaphorically speaking".

17:45.476 --> 17:47.311
Yeah, right.

18:27.810 --> 18:29.520
Smoking!

18:31.523 --> 18:33.608
It's party time.

18:33.691 --> 18:35.068
P-A-R-T-Y

18:35.151 --> 18:38.278
Why? Because I gotta.

18:45.370 --> 18:47.038
MANAGER

18:47.122 --> 18:48.873
QUIET PLEASE

19:21.823 --> 19:24.117
Snooze!

19:48.558 --> 19:52.562
Look, ma, I'm road kill!

20:01.572 --> 20:04.867
- Get out of the road!
- I think he wants to communicate.

20:06.368 --> 20:07.703
squeeze me gently

20:25.678 --> 20:26.638
Hey, mister...

20:26.721 --> 20:28.681
you got the time?

20:28.765 --> 20:31.352
As a matter of fact, I do, Cubbie!

20:35.356 --> 20:36.732
Look at that!

20:36.774 --> 20:40.903
Time to honk your nose and pull
your underwear over your head.

20:47.577 --> 20:49.161
Come on!

20:55.960 --> 20:59.171
Step right up here, don't be shy!

20:59.255 --> 21:00.423
Nobody likes...

21:00.464 --> 21:02.801
a bashful leather head.

21:02.843 --> 21:03.927
Move it!

21:04.010 --> 21:06.387
For my first trick...

21:07.430 --> 21:09.807
I'll do something for you, son.

21:12.893 --> 21:17.357
We have a giraffe. There you go, son.
Now get out of here, you bother me.

21:19.526 --> 21:21.486
Now...

21:22.486 --> 21:24.488
Sorry, wrong pocket.

21:24.572 --> 21:25.865
For you...

21:27.199 --> 21:28.868
a little body English.

21:32.664 --> 21:35.125
A French poodle.

21:37.169 --> 21:39.421
The dog was rabid, had to put it down.

21:40.714 --> 21:43.633
At last but not least, my favorite.

21:55.186 --> 21:57.271
A Tommy gun.

22:09.576 --> 22:11.536
This is incredible.

22:11.578 --> 22:14.206
With these powers I could be...

22:16.959 --> 22:19.170
a superhero.

22:19.212 --> 22:21.339
I'd fight crime,
protect the innocent...

22:21.380 --> 22:25.051
work for world peace.

22:25.134 --> 22:26.718
But first...

22:27.928 --> 22:29.929
RIPLEY'S AUTO FINISHING

22:33.183 --> 22:36.603
Hold onto your lug nuts...

22:36.686 --> 22:39.689
it's time for an overhaul.

23:25.611 --> 23:27.613
It was a dream.

23:29.407 --> 23:31.618
It was a dream.

23:35.455 --> 23:37.498
I must lay off the cartoons.

23:48.760 --> 23:52.555
Lt. Kellaway. You know anything
about the disturbance last night?

23:54.223 --> 23:56.267
Disturbance?

23:56.350 --> 23:59.604
Some prowler broke in
and attacked Mrs. Peenman.

23:59.645 --> 24:01.148
Attacked?

24:01.190 --> 24:02.858
You didn't hear anything?

24:02.941 --> 24:07.236
She unloaded a couple of rounds
of buckshot 5 feet from here.

24:07.320 --> 24:09.405
Look at the floor.

24:09.489 --> 24:11.949
He put that right in my floor,
then he jumped out...

24:12.033 --> 24:15.495
the window. Officer,
are you writing notes?

24:15.578 --> 24:17.372
This is...

24:17.456 --> 24:18.624
impossible.

24:18.665 --> 24:21.543
Those pyjamas are impossible.
This happened.

24:22.878 --> 24:25.297
See, I have...

24:25.339 --> 24:27.507
an inner ear problem.

24:29.092 --> 24:31.804
- Sometimes I can't hear anything.
- Is that so?

24:35.057 --> 24:39.478
Here's my card. If you recall
anything unusual about last night...

24:39.520 --> 24:42.105
anything at all, call me.

24:42.188 --> 24:43.815
You bet. Thank you.

24:43.856 --> 24:45.983
And good luck...

24:46.735 --> 24:48.320
cracking the case.

25:01.543 --> 25:04.045
Oh, my God, I'm late!

25:05.213 --> 25:07.297
Keys, keys...

25:07.381 --> 25:09.174
Where's the keys?

25:10.467 --> 25:11.510
Damn.

25:12.553 --> 25:14.429
Get the keys.

25:14.512 --> 25:15.680
Find them.

25:19.184 --> 25:20.894
Get the keys.

25:28.902 --> 25:31.614
I am so late.

25:33.408 --> 25:35.743
Good boy.

25:35.827 --> 25:39.080
Come on, Milo. Give them to me.
Drop it.

26:10.361 --> 26:13.573
I want a proctologist standing by.

26:13.656 --> 26:15.658
The best one you can find.

26:15.742 --> 26:18.579
Can you tell me what happened?

26:18.621 --> 26:22.415
- No, you can quote me.
- Looks like some Mob tactic.

26:22.457 --> 26:26.794
She broke the case. Come on,
get these rubbernecks out of here.

26:35.762 --> 26:39.432
Where were you last night?
We looked all over for you.

26:39.474 --> 26:42.435
Did you happen to look outside,
in the gutter?

26:42.477 --> 26:44.062
Did you check the paper?

26:44.145 --> 26:45.939
Your girlfriend got a great review.

26:46.022 --> 26:48.067
Bombshell Explodes at Coco Bongo

26:48.150 --> 26:50.986
You're 50 minutes late.
That's like stealing.

26:51.028 --> 26:55.782
I'm sorry, Mr. Dickey. It'll never
happen again. I've been a jerk.

26:55.824 --> 26:58.618
If you weren't busy oogling
girlie pictures...

26:58.701 --> 27:00.995
you might get some work done.

27:01.079 --> 27:04.875
Sir. She's a perspective
client of Stanley's.

27:04.959 --> 27:06.377
Really?

27:10.922 --> 27:13.133
The next time she comes in...

27:13.216 --> 27:14.676
send her to my office.

27:17.012 --> 27:17.972
You bet.

27:22.685 --> 27:25.229
Gee, I wish "my" daddy
owned a bank.

27:25.312 --> 27:28.565
Then I could be a rich
little creep too.

27:28.648 --> 27:30.525
You think she'll ever come back?

27:30.608 --> 27:34.196
Oh, man, forget her. Listen to me.

27:34.280 --> 27:37.908
Girls like her always look for
the BBD: Bigger Better Deal.

27:37.992 --> 27:40.244
You don't know that.

27:40.327 --> 27:43.372
She's an artist. She's...

27:43.456 --> 27:45.666
- sensitive.
- Forget her.

27:45.708 --> 27:49.837
She'll rip out your heart,
put it in a blender and hit "frappe".

27:49.879 --> 27:53.758
You don't need her.
You need somebody down to earth.

27:53.841 --> 27:57.928
Somebody with some integrity.
Somebody with...

27:58.012 --> 27:59.262
red hair...

27:59.345 --> 28:01.222
full, pouting lips...

28:01.264 --> 28:03.601
a white blouse, green jacket...

28:03.684 --> 28:04.935
and a name tag.

28:05.019 --> 28:07.271
You really narrowed it down.

28:07.354 --> 28:09.523
Too bad she's already taken.

28:11.567 --> 28:14.028
Hello there, may I be of assistance?

28:14.111 --> 28:16.155
Stanley Ipkiss?

28:19.159 --> 28:21.787
Hi! I'm Peggy Brandt
from the Tribune.

28:24.414 --> 28:27.708
I canceled my subscription because
they kept stealing--

28:27.750 --> 28:30.628
No, actually, I want to ask you
a few questions.

28:30.711 --> 28:33.380
Really? About what?

28:33.422 --> 28:37.134
Ripley Auto Finishing.
You're a customer, aren't you?

28:40.137 --> 28:41.388
Me?

28:42.264 --> 28:44.433
I don't even have a car.

28:44.517 --> 28:47.145
You know, 'cause they pollute.

28:47.229 --> 28:49.689
You don't own an '89 Civic?

28:52.025 --> 28:53.944
Oh, that car, yeah.

28:56.947 --> 28:58.532
It's coming back to me.

28:58.615 --> 29:01.076
Miss... What was your name?

29:01.118 --> 29:02.411
Peggy Brandt.

29:03.579 --> 29:04.704
Wait a minute.

29:04.788 --> 29:06.498
Peggy Brandt?

29:06.581 --> 29:08.082
Of "Ask Peggy"?

29:09.750 --> 29:10.918
That's right.

29:11.001 --> 29:13.921
You printed one of my letters
last year.

29:13.963 --> 29:16.465
Remember? "Nice Guys Finish Last."

29:17.676 --> 29:19.052
You're Mister Nice Guy?

29:20.303 --> 29:25.767
Do you realize how much mail
we got about that letter?

29:25.851 --> 29:29.187
100's of women are looking
for a guy like you.

29:31.273 --> 29:33.443
Really?

29:33.484 --> 29:36.654
You know how hard it is to find
a decent man in this town?

29:36.737 --> 29:39.448
Most think monogamy is a kind of wood.

29:44.244 --> 29:47.205
Why are you covering this story?

29:47.289 --> 29:51.001
Because "Dear Peggy" pays dick.
I'm starving to death.

29:51.084 --> 29:53.253
I'm looking to become a real reporter.

29:53.336 --> 29:57.340
When you were at Ripley Auto
did you see anything suspicious?

29:57.424 --> 29:58.633
Anything?

29:58.675 --> 30:00.677
I won't make trouble for you.

30:00.719 --> 30:02.263
I just want the truth.

30:03.723 --> 30:07.602
God, I wish I knew the truth.
You know, I really do.

30:10.771 --> 30:13.482
If you think of anything...

30:13.523 --> 30:15.400
this is my number.

30:16.151 --> 30:17.278
This is my...

30:17.361 --> 30:19.781
you know, personal number.

30:21.991 --> 30:24.452
100's of women are looking
for a guy like me?

30:24.535 --> 30:25.870
Sure.

30:27.037 --> 30:28.830
I'm one of them.

30:36.839 --> 30:39.175
120 yards.

30:44.846 --> 30:45.972
Hello, Dorian.

30:49.519 --> 30:51.896
Thanks for dropping by.

30:51.979 --> 30:56.275
Next time, call.
Leave the delivery boys at home.

31:17.797 --> 31:19.882
The cops...

31:19.966 --> 31:23.803
tried to shut the club
down this morning.

31:23.886 --> 31:28.558
They say you've been using the place
to run your own small-time scams.

31:28.599 --> 31:31.144
When I hear things like that...

31:31.227 --> 31:34.690
I start losing my concentration.

31:34.773 --> 31:37.401
My game...

31:37.484 --> 31:40.612
it goes straight to hell.

31:42.781 --> 31:45.325
You could too.

31:46.952 --> 31:48.996
205 yards.

31:49.079 --> 31:51.164
I'm fed up with you...

31:52.039 --> 31:53.499
but....

31:53.583 --> 31:55.251
I'll cut you a break.

31:56.919 --> 31:59.881
One week to get out of town.

31:59.964 --> 32:02.049
After that...

32:02.133 --> 32:06.764
I'll use your empty little skull
to break in my new nine iron.

32:47.012 --> 32:48.640
Are you okay?

32:48.681 --> 32:51.267
Your car, sir.

32:54.813 --> 32:56.772
I am now.

33:14.373 --> 33:17.000
Tina, come on.

33:18.128 --> 33:19.712
You can't.

33:20.672 --> 33:22.215
You can't.

33:25.885 --> 33:27.262
Go on.

33:28.847 --> 33:31.390
I don't believe it.

33:51.161 --> 33:53.037
Stupid.

33:54.873 --> 33:56.749
She would never...

34:22.777 --> 34:24.695
No way!

34:53.306 --> 34:55.141
Hold on, Sugar.

34:55.226 --> 34:58.437
Daddy's got a sweet tooth tonight.

35:15.078 --> 35:17.705
Somebody,stop me.

35:22.670 --> 35:25.422
Can't make the scene
if you don't have the green.

35:25.506 --> 35:27.675
I better make a little stop.

35:34.516 --> 35:37.978
EDGE CITY POWER
"SERVICE WORTH WAITING FOR"

35:38.019 --> 35:39.688
How's it going, Freeze?

35:39.771 --> 35:41.272
It's looking good here.

35:41.355 --> 35:45.609
You're on your own. I must
go downstairs, make sure I'm seen.

35:45.693 --> 35:46.735
Do it.

35:46.819 --> 35:50.322
The doctor is about to operate.

36:13.638 --> 36:16.307
Sorry, fellas. Waste not, want not.

36:27.486 --> 36:28.819
Cops!

36:39.581 --> 36:42.292
Not on the list, not in the club.

36:59.059 --> 37:00.477
How do?

37:06.484 --> 37:07.777
You on the list?

37:07.860 --> 37:13.031
No, but I believe my friends are.
Perhaps you know them?

37:13.073 --> 37:14.783
Franklin, Grant...

37:14.825 --> 37:16.118
and Jackson.

37:22.290 --> 37:26.002
That's it! No one gets in.

37:29.798 --> 37:33.428
Now we present the most beautiful
flower of the Congo Bongo...

37:33.511 --> 37:35.638
Miss Tina Carlyle.

37:50.445 --> 37:51.696
Beautiful.

37:53.406 --> 37:56.408
Love makes me treat you...

37:56.491 --> 37:59.911
The way that I do
Gee, baby...

37:59.953 --> 38:03.291
ain't I good to you

38:03.332 --> 38:06.419
There's nothing too good...

38:06.502 --> 38:09.046
for a boy that's so true

38:09.130 --> 38:13.259
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you

38:13.342 --> 38:16.846
I bought you a fur coat
for Christmas

38:16.929 --> 38:19.475
A diamond ring...

38:19.516 --> 38:21.351
a Cadillac car...

38:21.435 --> 38:24.521
And everything

38:24.605 --> 38:27.356
Love makes me treat you...

38:27.440 --> 38:29.816
the way that I do

38:29.858 --> 38:32.778
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you

38:34.739 --> 38:37.950
Love makes me treat you...

38:38.034 --> 38:40.286
the way that I do

38:40.369 --> 38:43.372
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you

38:44.957 --> 38:48.002
There's nothing too good...

38:48.044 --> 38:50.964
for a man so true

38:51.048 --> 38:53.717
Gee,baby, ain't I good to you

38:55.302 --> 39:00.515
I know how to make a man happy
I'll treat you right

39:03.393 --> 39:05.687
- Why are you here?
- There's trouble.

39:05.729 --> 39:07.314
You better come upstairs.

39:08.564 --> 39:10.149
Come on, let's go.

39:15.822 --> 39:18.659
They got me paying taxes...

39:18.742 --> 39:20.536
for what I gave to you

39:20.577 --> 39:24.540
Gee, baby, ain't I good to you

39:45.102 --> 39:47.813
Let's rock this joint.

41:00.553 --> 41:01.971
Smoking.

41:05.017 --> 41:06.435
What happened?

41:09.646 --> 41:11.855
Someone hit the joint before us.

41:13.440 --> 41:14.817
Get that, Doc.

41:16.193 --> 41:18.320
Suck on that.

41:24.536 --> 41:26.329
Son of a bitch!

41:29.499 --> 41:31.084
Who did this, man?

41:31.167 --> 41:32.877
Who?!

41:33.796 --> 41:35.089
Him!

41:35.172 --> 41:37.758
That's the guy.

41:37.842 --> 41:40.136
The guy dancing with Tina?

41:40.177 --> 41:42.012
He's dead meat.

41:42.054 --> 41:43.222
Come on.

42:24.930 --> 42:26.724
I want this place cleared now.

42:43.574 --> 42:47.870
Club's closed. Move it!
You think I'm joking? Come on, move it!

42:47.953 --> 42:49.998
Party's over, let's go!

42:50.707 --> 42:52.041
Get out of here.

42:53.626 --> 42:54.585
Get lost!

42:55.961 --> 42:57.797
Okay, Twinkle Toes.

42:57.838 --> 43:00.299
Where is my money, tell me now.

43:06.348 --> 43:09.934
You've got 17.5 %  in T-bills
amortized over the fiscal year.

43:09.975 --> 43:11.227
8 %  in stocks and bonds.

43:11.310 --> 43:13.854
Carry the 9, divide by the GNP...

43:13.938 --> 43:17.483
Fortunately, funeral bouquets
are deductible.

43:18.359 --> 43:20.028
Ice this deadbeat.

43:26.492 --> 43:27.409
Shoot him!

43:32.832 --> 43:33.749
Thanks.

43:41.466 --> 43:44.010
You got me, partner.

43:56.022 --> 43:58.858
Hold me close,Red.

43:58.941 --> 44:00.818
It's getting dark.

44:05.949 --> 44:08.702
Tell Auntie Em to let Old Yeller out.

44:12.914 --> 44:15.959
Tell Tiny Tim I won't be coming home
this Christmas.

44:20.673 --> 44:22.800
Tell Scarlet I do give a damn.

44:27.346 --> 44:28.264
Pardon me.

44:36.980 --> 44:38.565
Thank you.

44:40.358 --> 44:41.610
You love me.

44:41.693 --> 44:44.696
You really love me.

44:50.453 --> 44:52.747
You're not going anywhere.

44:59.170 --> 45:00.755
Drop it, Tyrel!

45:05.760 --> 45:07.178
Drop it.

45:09.846 --> 45:13.350
You got a warrant?
Or did you come for a nightcap?

45:14.643 --> 45:17.354
What I got is probable cause.

45:17.437 --> 45:19.774
Your boys knocked over Edge City Bank.

45:19.857 --> 45:21.692
Easy. You're giving me a woody.

45:21.776 --> 45:24.403
And one was wearing a big,
green mask.

45:24.445 --> 45:27.073
For once, you're right.

45:27.156 --> 45:29.575
Except it wasn't one of my boys.

45:29.617 --> 45:33.246
Maybe if you tried a little
actual police work...

45:33.287 --> 45:34.706
Cuff him.

45:34.790 --> 45:38.334
We got a stiff upstairs.
It's a guy from the heist.

45:38.417 --> 45:41.254
Call that high-priced
lawyer of yours.

45:41.295 --> 45:43.631
We'll go downtown for a chat.

45:43.714 --> 45:45.591
Get him out of here.

46:05.696 --> 46:08.782
I know you're in there.

46:11.659 --> 46:13.161
Police!

46:15.079 --> 46:16.497
Open up!

46:16.581 --> 46:19.292
Oh, my God.

46:22.004 --> 46:25.466
I know you're in there!

46:32.096 --> 46:33.222
Open up!

46:33.306 --> 46:37.227
Come on, I'm getting blisters
on my fingers.

46:41.440 --> 46:42.482
Stop it.

46:43.566 --> 46:44.859
I'm coming, okay.

46:44.901 --> 46:47.445
I'll be right there.

46:51.533 --> 46:53.827
Let's go, move it!

46:53.869 --> 46:55.829
Alright!

47:01.543 --> 47:03.170
Hi, Lieutenant.

47:03.212 --> 47:06.925
This isn't the best time right now.
I just--

47:07.008 --> 47:08.927
Won't you come in?

47:11.804 --> 47:13.222
Where were you last night?

47:14.181 --> 47:15.890
Here, mostly.

47:15.932 --> 47:16.891
Something wrong?

47:16.974 --> 47:18.976
What do you know about The Mask?

47:19.060 --> 47:21.146
"Mask?"

47:21.230 --> 47:22.898
Don't insult my intelligence.

47:22.981 --> 47:26.777
He robs the bank you work in,
then I find this in the Coco Bongo.

47:26.860 --> 47:29.488
There can't be 2 idiots
with these pajamas.

47:31.865 --> 47:34.076
May I see those pajamas?

47:36.371 --> 47:37.956
Those pajamas?

47:38.039 --> 47:40.917
Those pajamas...

47:42.210 --> 47:43.378
were stolen.

47:43.419 --> 47:46.089
Somebody stole your pajamas?

47:51.385 --> 47:55.681
What is this city coming to...

47:55.764 --> 48:00.978
when a man's pajama drawer is
no longer safe!

48:06.234 --> 48:07.777
Look at that guy.

48:07.861 --> 48:11.030
- Nobody's that fast at my bank.
- I'll say.

48:13.825 --> 48:16.286
That's one hell of a rubber mask.

48:16.369 --> 48:17.662
Lab reports?

48:17.745 --> 48:22.292
We got fingerprints from currency,
but nothing matches Tyrel's men.

48:22.375 --> 48:23.918
He beat them to the punch.

48:23.960 --> 48:28.798
Get the bank employee files and run
down the prints on a guy named Ipkiss.

48:28.882 --> 48:31.383
You figure it was an inside job?

48:31.467 --> 48:35.054
I need some prints to lock
this whack job up till doomsday.

48:37.515 --> 48:39.559
50 grand...

48:39.601 --> 48:44.230
to whoever finds that green bastard
before the cops.

48:44.314 --> 48:47.650
I want you to get the word out
to every street hustler...

48:47.734 --> 48:50.488
every low life in this town.
Understand?

48:50.571 --> 48:53.699
I want him here tomorrow, alive.

48:55.533 --> 48:56.951
You still here?

48:56.993 --> 48:58.953
Come on, let's go.

49:04.042 --> 49:05.753
What are you looking at?

49:05.836 --> 49:06.921
You.

49:06.962 --> 49:08.589
You're losing it.

49:08.672 --> 49:12.425
I'm not losing anything...

49:12.509 --> 49:14.344
except maybe some extra baggage.

49:14.427 --> 49:16.012
What's that mean?

49:18.348 --> 49:21.685
You didn't fight much last night
when that freak kissed you.

49:21.769 --> 49:25.022
Did it look like I had much
of a choice?

49:26.232 --> 49:27.816
Maybe you did...

49:30.193 --> 49:32.821
maybe you didn't. Who knows, right?

49:34.531 --> 49:35.825
I'll tell you one thing.

49:36.992 --> 49:40.287
It's going to be payback for anybody
who crosses me.

49:50.923 --> 49:54.510
We have a crisis here and you
stroll in an hour late?

49:54.593 --> 49:56.554
If I must put up with--

49:56.637 --> 49:59.431
Back off, monkey boy...

49:59.515 --> 50:03.184
or I'll tell your dad you treat
this place like your piggy bank.

50:03.268 --> 50:05.187
Or we should call the IRS...

50:05.229 --> 50:08.482
and arrange a vacation for you
at Club Fed?

50:11.652 --> 50:13.571
That'll be all.

50:17.324 --> 50:18.576
Genius.

50:18.659 --> 50:22.330
That was genius. Buddy, I have chills.

50:22.414 --> 50:26.251
God! What side of whose bed
did you wake up on, man?

50:26.334 --> 50:27.752
I'm not sure.

50:28.795 --> 50:31.213
I haven't exactly been myself lately.

50:31.297 --> 50:33.340
You don't look real fabulous.

50:33.382 --> 50:35.384
Really, do I look bad?

50:36.635 --> 50:40.181
Don't worry. This'll put the color
back in your cheeks.

50:40.222 --> 50:44.560
2 tickets to the charity ball
at the Coco Bongo Club, Saturday.

50:44.602 --> 50:47.104
Anybody who's anybody will be there.

50:47.188 --> 50:49.064
Want to be my date?

50:55.530 --> 50:58.033
Wait just a minute.

50:58.116 --> 51:01.453
- Why are you here?
- I wanted to thank you.

51:02.621 --> 51:05.500
I don't have much to open an account
with anymore.

51:05.583 --> 51:08.919
What about the club?
You were doing great.

51:08.960 --> 51:11.837
It's not your problem.
I'll be okay.

51:11.921 --> 51:13.631
Come here.

51:18.427 --> 51:21.807
You didn't stop by just to see me,
did you?

51:24.100 --> 51:25.727
It's okay, tell me.

51:28.396 --> 51:31.066
The guy they say robbed this place...

51:31.149 --> 51:33.985
- The Mask?
- I think he was at the club.

51:34.986 --> 51:36.322
Really?

51:36.405 --> 51:38.991
They say he's pretty...

51:39.075 --> 51:40.200
weird looking.

51:43.453 --> 51:44.913
Yeah, but...

51:44.996 --> 51:47.374
you should see him dance.

51:49.126 --> 51:52.587
Did anyone find out who he is?

51:52.671 --> 51:54.798
Why, you interested?

51:56.675 --> 51:58.802
Just curious, I guess.

52:00.929 --> 52:04.391
I better be going.

52:04.474 --> 52:06.436
Thanks for everything.

52:08.104 --> 52:09.689
You'd like to see him again?

52:15.819 --> 52:17.362
I wouldn't mind.

52:17.446 --> 52:20.073
I know him, you know.

52:20.157 --> 52:21.784
You do?

52:21.868 --> 52:24.996
We're old college buddies,
him and me.

52:26.372 --> 52:29.750
It's funny you mention
he dances because...

52:33.170 --> 52:36.924
I taught him a couple of
dance moves myself.

52:37.008 --> 52:40.136
Think you could have him
meet me tonight?

52:40.219 --> 52:42.305
Maybe I could work something out.

52:42.388 --> 52:45.308
- How about at Landfill Park?
- Sunset.

52:45.391 --> 52:47.267
- Perfect.
- Super.

52:48.602 --> 52:52.106
Thanks, Stanley.
You really are a nice guy.

52:58.988 --> 53:01.199
This is an interesting place.

53:01.282 --> 53:04.452
Looks like fourth-
or fifth-century Scandinavian.

53:04.535 --> 53:08.916
Possibly a representation of one
of the Norse night gods, maybe Loki.

53:11.751 --> 53:13.586
Loki?

53:13.669 --> 53:15.087
Who is Loki?

53:15.171 --> 53:17.632
The Norse god of mischief.

53:17.715 --> 53:22.678
Supposedly he caused such trouble that
Odin banished him from Valhalla forever.

53:24.722 --> 53:27.433
Then he could have banished him
into that mask.

53:27.517 --> 53:30.561
I'm talking about mythology,
Mr. Ipkiss.

53:30.645 --> 53:32.563
This is a piece of wood.

53:33.564 --> 53:35.108
but your book...!

53:35.191 --> 53:38.695
My book is about
masks as a metaphor.

53:38.779 --> 53:41.865
A metaphor,not to be taken literally.

53:41.949 --> 53:43.867
You suffer from a mild delusion.

53:47.037 --> 53:48.455
Alright.

53:51.917 --> 53:53.584
I'll prove it to you.

53:54.794 --> 53:58.339
But I am not responsible
for the consequences.

53:58.422 --> 54:02.301
Just sit back and enjoy the ride,
Mr. Expert.

54:02.385 --> 54:05.429
You don't scare me.
Go right ahead.

54:06.765 --> 54:08.725
See you.

54:33.833 --> 54:38.255
You said Loki was a night god.
Maybe it works at night.

54:38.338 --> 54:43.802
I should warn you that I don't work
personally with really sick people.

54:43.886 --> 54:47.306
There are private institutions
for those things.

54:47.347 --> 54:51.352
I can arrange for a safe environment
for you tonight, if you want.

54:55.482 --> 54:57.275
I must see Tina.

54:58.484 --> 55:00.152
But what can I do?

55:00.986 --> 55:03.113
Do I go as myself...

55:03.155 --> 55:04.782
or The Mask?

55:06.242 --> 55:10.371
If I tell you, you promise
to leave my office right now?

55:17.002 --> 55:18.879
Go as yourself...

55:18.962 --> 55:21.216
and as The Mask.

55:21.257 --> 55:25.637
Because they are both
one and the same beautiful person.

55:27.222 --> 55:30.600
Got the cross-check on
the fingerprints. It's Ipkiss.

55:30.683 --> 55:31.975
I'm looking at him.

55:32.059 --> 55:34.520
Keep the SWAT team standing by.

55:34.561 --> 55:38.274
If he's half as bad as they say,
we'll have a full dance card.

55:38.358 --> 55:40.110
Pickle relish?

55:40.193 --> 55:43.113
- Get in the car.
- But I ordered onion rings.

55:47.367 --> 55:49.577
LANDFILL PARK

56:11.057 --> 56:12.725
What are you doing here?

56:15.562 --> 56:19.482
I wanted to make sure that you
2 got together all right.

56:19.566 --> 56:21.360
That's nice.

56:21.444 --> 56:24.780
I hardly ever stop by here.

56:24.864 --> 56:26.991
It's hard to believe it was...

56:27.074 --> 56:28.242
a garbage heap.

56:30.578 --> 56:35.540
It's really beautiful
right around sunset.

56:35.623 --> 56:39.586
The methane emissions
really pick up the colors.

56:39.669 --> 56:41.087
All those...

56:41.171 --> 56:43.756
pinks and greens.

56:50.013 --> 56:53.267
My friend will be along here
any minute. I better go.

56:55.144 --> 56:56.937
Stanley, wait.

57:03.194 --> 57:04.904
Hello, cherie.

57:04.987 --> 57:07.032
We meet again!

57:07.115 --> 57:08.408
Is it fate?

57:08.492 --> 57:11.451
Is it meant to be?
It is written in the stars...

57:11.493 --> 57:13.995
that we are destined to fraternize?

57:14.037 --> 57:16.915
I'd like to think so.

57:21.085 --> 57:25.716
Kiss me, my dear, and I will reveal
my croissant.

57:25.800 --> 57:30.596
I will spread your p t . I will dip
my ladle in your vichyssoise.

57:35.184 --> 57:37.145
She's so coy.

57:37.187 --> 57:39.189
I love it.

57:45.152 --> 57:48.739
Our love is like a red, red rose.

57:48.823 --> 57:51.367
And I am a little thorny.

57:51.450 --> 57:53.994
Je t'adore! Je t'adore!

57:54.036 --> 57:56.163
Shoot the window. I don't care!

57:58.124 --> 58:00.835
This is Kellaway.
I need back-up.

58:02.378 --> 58:03.712
Cigarette?

58:15.559 --> 58:18.102
Now, like Napoleon...

58:18.185 --> 58:21.648
I will divide and conquer.

58:22.566 --> 58:24.734
Police!

58:26.069 --> 58:27.028
Merde.

58:27.070 --> 58:29.489
Freeze.

58:32.783 --> 58:34.160
Put your hands up.

58:34.243 --> 58:36.496
But you told me to freeze.

58:36.538 --> 58:39.749
Alright, alright, unfreeze.

58:40.584 --> 58:42.878
You're under arrest.

58:42.961 --> 58:45.714
It wasn't me.

58:45.755 --> 58:48.258
It was the one-armed man.

58:49.134 --> 58:50.926
Alright, I confess.

58:50.968 --> 58:54.347
I did it, you hear?
And I'm glad, glad, I tell you!

58:55.765 --> 59:00.061
What are they going to do to me, Sarge?
What are they going to do?

59:00.145 --> 59:03.440
Sorry, son, that's not my department.

59:03.523 --> 59:04.733
Search him.

59:07.945 --> 59:10.406
Where's a camcorder when you need one?

59:15.535 --> 59:18.872
It's going to be a long night.
My wife'll kill me.

59:18.955 --> 59:22.584
- What is it?
- Cops got Ipkiss at Landfill Park.

59:22.626 --> 59:26.296
Let me cover it. I need this story.
You go home to Claire.

59:26.379 --> 59:28.548
I don't know. Ramsey said--

59:28.632 --> 59:30.884
I will take care of Ramsey.

59:30.967 --> 59:32.677
Thanks a million, I owe you one.

59:33.845 --> 59:36.306
Really big sunglasses, nerf ball...

59:36.389 --> 59:38.810
Bike horn...

59:38.851 --> 59:41.729
Small-mouthed bass...
bowling pin...

59:44.357 --> 59:45.399
mouse-trap...

59:45.483 --> 59:47.110
rubber chicken...

59:47.151 --> 59:50.279
- Little to the left. That's it.
- I don't know.

59:50.321 --> 59:52.323
Funny eyeball glasses...

59:52.406 --> 59:54.700
I've never seen those in my life.

59:54.784 --> 59:56.952
- bazooka.
- I have a permit for that.

59:58.036 --> 59:59.955
- Picture of Kellaway's wife...
- What?

01:00:00.705 --> 01:00:02.165
CALL ME LOVER!

01:00:02.249 --> 01:00:04.292
Margaret! Son of a bitch!

01:00:04.376 --> 01:00:08.673
I figured you had a sense of humor.

01:00:08.756 --> 01:00:09.966
you married her!

01:00:12.468 --> 01:00:15.096
That's got to hurt.

01:00:15.179 --> 01:00:16.472
Get him!

01:00:39.996 --> 01:00:42.540
It's over. Raise your hands...

01:00:42.623 --> 01:00:44.667
or we'll fire.

01:00:48.171 --> 01:00:49.338
Hit it!

01:01:10.235 --> 01:01:14.238
They call me Cuban Pete
I'm the king of the rumba beat

01:01:14.322 --> 01:01:15.865
When I play the maracas

01:01:15.948 --> 01:01:17.700
I go chick-chicky boom

01:01:18.951 --> 01:01:20.411
Yes, I'm Cuban Pete

01:01:20.495 --> 01:01:22.748
I'm the craze of my street

01:01:22.831 --> 01:01:26.960
When I start to dance everything goes
Chick-chicky boom, chick-chicky boom

01:01:27.044 --> 01:01:29.171
The senoritas sing...

01:01:29.254 --> 01:01:31.507
and they swing

01:01:31.590 --> 01:01:33.509
It's very nice

01:01:33.550 --> 01:01:34.675
Full of spice

01:01:35.718 --> 01:01:39.932
They dance and bring a happy ring
Never a care

01:01:40.015 --> 01:01:43.936
Singing a song
All the day long

01:01:46.605 --> 01:01:50.359
If you like the beat
Take a lesson from Cuban Pete

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:52.694
I'll teach you to
chick-chicky boom

01:01:54.780 --> 01:01:56.782
He's a modest guy

01:01:56.865 --> 01:01:59.159
Although he's the hottest guy

01:01:59.243 --> 01:02:03.122
In Havana

01:02:03.205 --> 01:02:05.249
Si, senorita, I know...

01:02:05.332 --> 01:02:07.918
that when I chicky boom

01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:11.255
It's very nice
so full of spice

01:02:11.296 --> 01:02:13.465
I place my hand on your hip

01:02:13.549 --> 01:02:16.260
And if you will give me your hand

01:02:16.301 --> 01:02:20.264
Then we shall try
Just you and I

01:02:21.557 --> 01:02:24.269
- Not bad.
- Shut up and help me down.

01:02:24.310 --> 01:02:27.981
I'll teach you to chick-chicky boom
Chick-chicky boom

01:02:49.668 --> 01:02:52.004
Dance and I'll blow your brains out.

01:02:56.426 --> 01:02:57.760
Give me that thing.

01:02:59.304 --> 01:03:00.430
See you!

01:03:00.472 --> 01:03:04.684
There! Let's get him.
Snap out of it. This dance is over!

01:03:04.767 --> 01:03:07.188
Let's go! Follow me, officers!

01:03:13.026 --> 01:03:17.154
He's down the alley. Follow me.
Come on. Grab your gun.

01:03:38.219 --> 01:03:39.804
Stanley, get in!

01:03:41.138 --> 01:03:42.181
There!

01:03:44.308 --> 01:03:46.477
Halt, or I'll shoot!

01:03:48.436 --> 01:03:49.646
Shoot! Shoot!

01:03:51.731 --> 01:03:53.316
Seat belts.

01:03:57.529 --> 01:03:58.696
I missed him.

01:03:59.864 --> 01:04:02.534
Come on, we all missed him.

01:04:05.578 --> 01:04:08.541
THE MASK ROBS BANK

01:04:08.582 --> 01:04:10.376
I saw it.

01:04:11.252 --> 01:04:13.045
I saw everything.

01:04:14.004 --> 01:04:16.382
What's happening to you, Stanley?

01:04:18.759 --> 01:04:20.718
It's crazy.

01:04:25.057 --> 01:04:27.893
I'm losing control.

01:04:27.977 --> 01:04:30.062
When I put that mask on...

01:04:30.146 --> 01:04:32.231
I can do anything.

01:04:32.272 --> 01:04:35.191
Be anything.

01:04:38.279 --> 01:04:40.531
It's wrecking my life.

01:04:40.573 --> 01:04:44.618
My life is wrecked. Wrecked.

01:04:46.162 --> 01:04:49.206
I don't know what's happening to you...

01:04:50.624 --> 01:04:52.961
but I do know this:

01:04:54.628 --> 01:04:57.465
that letter you sent my column...

01:04:57.548 --> 01:05:00.509
that was from a guy with more guts...

01:05:01.510 --> 01:05:03.387
and more heart...

01:05:03.471 --> 01:05:06.807
than any of the creeps
I've met in this city.

01:05:06.891 --> 01:05:09.936
Whatever that mask is...

01:05:10.020 --> 01:05:11.396
you don't need it.

01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:13.689
You...

01:05:14.523 --> 01:05:16.901
Stanley Ipkiss...

01:05:16.942 --> 01:05:20.237
are already all you'll ever need to be.

01:05:24.493 --> 01:05:26.619
Gosh, Peg...

01:05:28.370 --> 01:05:30.122
do you really mean that?

01:05:31.582 --> 01:05:33.793
Actually...

01:05:33.876 --> 01:05:34.960
no.

01:05:35.044 --> 01:05:36.629
What?

01:05:38.673 --> 01:05:41.635
Where were you? I've been vamping
for 20 minutes.

01:05:42.677 --> 01:05:43.637
Is this him?

01:05:43.678 --> 01:05:45.680
You got the 50 thou'?

01:05:46.681 --> 01:05:48.725
Give her the money.

01:05:51.937 --> 01:05:53.271
Right.

01:05:53.313 --> 01:05:56.024
With the mask on, he turns
into that green thing.

01:05:59.109 --> 01:06:00.945
What are you doing?

01:06:01.028 --> 01:06:06.200
Sorry. You really are a great guy,
I just can't lose my condo.

01:06:06.283 --> 01:06:09.329
It's so hard to find an apartment
in this city.

01:06:14.251 --> 01:06:15.877
You said you wouldn't hurt him!

01:06:19.005 --> 01:06:20.173
I lied.

01:06:39.568 --> 01:06:41.153
Tell me.

01:06:41.236 --> 01:06:42.696
How's this mask work?

01:06:42.737 --> 01:06:45.615
I don't know. You just...

01:06:46.741 --> 01:06:47.868
put it on.

01:07:00.631 --> 01:07:01.883
Boss...

01:07:02.758 --> 01:07:04.343
be careful, huh?

01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:26.407
What a rush.

01:07:27.784 --> 01:07:31.621
You okay?

01:07:32.705 --> 01:07:34.707
I'm better than ever, you idiot.

01:07:36.292 --> 01:07:38.961
What do we do with Ipkiss?

01:07:41.255 --> 01:07:43.257
The police want the mask.

01:07:43.299 --> 01:07:46.302
We'll give them The Mask.

01:07:56.437 --> 01:07:58.815
The money better be here...

01:07:58.898 --> 01:08:01.484
or you can lp-kiss your ass good-bye.

01:08:48.823 --> 01:08:49.948
Get over there.

01:09:01.837 --> 01:09:04.965
Can't believe it. Hardened cops
dancing in the street...

01:09:05.006 --> 01:09:07.509
and broadcast on the 11 o'clock news.

01:09:07.593 --> 01:09:10.388
- The SWAT team was offered Vegas.
- I'm history.

01:09:10.471 --> 01:09:14.475
The Captain'll have my badge
for breakfast with a pension on top.

01:09:14.558 --> 01:09:18.144
It's not all your fault.
Something will turn up.

01:09:18.227 --> 01:09:21.898
Sure, Ipkiss will fall
right into my lap.

01:09:28.654 --> 01:09:30.573
Get him off of me!

01:09:35.621 --> 01:09:36.872
Wait!

01:09:36.955 --> 01:09:38.707
I can explain everything.

01:09:38.792 --> 01:09:42.587
You can explain everything?
Explain this!

01:09:43.837 --> 01:09:47.175
Get him up! Let's go!
I got a cell for you, pal.

01:10:10.824 --> 01:10:12.283
Forget about me, buddy.

01:10:12.367 --> 01:10:14.661
Find a new place to live.

01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:19.499
I'll be in here for a long, long time.

01:10:32.762 --> 01:10:34.596
You, with the face.

01:10:35.597 --> 01:10:37.224
You got a visitor.

01:10:46.359 --> 01:10:48.945
- Why?
- Is it true?

01:10:50.905 --> 01:10:52.323
You're The Mask.

01:10:52.407 --> 01:10:55.619
Yeah, but don't tell anybody.
If I get...

01:10:55.661 --> 01:10:58.705
a good lawyer and a deal...

01:10:58.788 --> 01:11:00.957
I'll be out in about 10,000 years.

01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:03.293
It's risky, coming here.

01:11:03.334 --> 01:11:05.879
Your boyfriend might be upset.

01:11:07.505 --> 01:11:11.635
He'll be at the charity ball tonight.

01:11:11.677 --> 01:11:13.970
Like what? The Lambada?

01:11:14.053 --> 01:11:18.224
This is serious. There must be a way
to stop him.

01:11:18.308 --> 01:11:20.435
How does it work?

01:11:21.227 --> 01:11:22.645
I don't know.

01:11:23.481 --> 01:11:26.025
It's like...

01:11:26.108 --> 01:11:29.487
it brings your innermost desires
to life.

01:11:29.570 --> 01:11:31.863
If deep down inside...

01:11:33.239 --> 01:11:36.326
you're a bit repressed and
hopelessly romantic...

01:11:36.367 --> 01:11:38.496
you become some sort of...

01:11:38.537 --> 01:11:41.248
a love-crazy wild man.

01:11:41.332 --> 01:11:43.334
And if you're like Dorian?

01:11:43.417 --> 01:11:46.212
Then we're all in big trouble.

01:11:46.295 --> 01:11:49.256
And if I were you,
I'd get out of town. Fast.

01:11:52.176 --> 01:11:53.427
Thanks.

01:11:54.386 --> 01:11:55.513
For what?

01:11:55.554 --> 01:11:57.848
Lots of things.

01:12:01.519 --> 01:12:04.062
Sharing a sunset with me.

01:12:04.145 --> 01:12:09.360
For being the only guy who treated me
like a person, not...

01:12:09.443 --> 01:12:10.569
a party favor.

01:12:13.948 --> 01:12:16.700
For being any kind of romantic...

01:12:16.784 --> 01:12:18.619
even a hopeless one.

01:12:24.417 --> 01:12:26.169
You're welcome.

01:12:26.253 --> 01:12:28.880
That night at the club I knew...

01:12:28.964 --> 01:12:31.925
I'd found someone special.

01:12:34.552 --> 01:12:37.262
The Mask.

01:12:37.345 --> 01:12:40.266
It was the guy inside The Mask.

01:12:40.349 --> 01:12:43.936
It was you all along.

01:12:49.316 --> 01:12:51.986
Lady, time's up.

01:12:52.069 --> 01:12:53.989
Could I have just...

01:12:54.072 --> 01:12:55.949
one more minute?

01:12:57.909 --> 01:13:00.287
I've got to disappear for a while now.

01:13:00.328 --> 01:13:03.999
Don't know where but I'll let you know
as soon as I can.

01:13:48.460 --> 01:13:50.670
Somebody help me!

01:13:55.509 --> 01:13:57.177
Guard, guard!

01:13:57.260 --> 01:14:00.514
A woman's being chased in the alley.

01:14:00.597 --> 01:14:02.516
She needs help.

01:14:02.599 --> 01:14:05.310
Sure. Keep it down.

01:14:05.393 --> 01:14:08.146
Serve and protect, man!

01:14:28.584 --> 01:14:31.003
Good boy. Come on.

01:14:33.131 --> 01:14:35.298
Jump up. Can you jump up?

01:14:37.008 --> 01:14:39.971
Remember how I taught you not to
jump up on people? Forget that.

01:14:40.054 --> 01:14:42.056
Come on! Get up here.

01:14:44.308 --> 01:14:46.185
Get up. Get up here!

01:14:47.061 --> 01:14:49.646
Get up. Get up here. That's it.

01:14:49.688 --> 01:14:52.190
You can do it.
Come on. Come on!

01:14:55.862 --> 01:14:57.363
Put some effort into it!

01:15:14.380 --> 01:15:16.883
Baby, there you are.

01:15:16.924 --> 01:15:18.801
I was worried about you.

01:15:18.885 --> 01:15:22.929
- You talk to the cops?
- Only to see what Ipkiss told them.

01:15:23.013 --> 01:15:27.059
That's right, you and Stanley.
You two are getting awfully close.

01:15:28.186 --> 01:15:30.229
Bet you helped him with the bank job.

01:15:30.313 --> 01:15:33.107
- That's ridiculous.
- Oh, is it?

01:15:34.442 --> 01:15:36.944
Look what I found in her car.

01:15:38.779 --> 01:15:40.073
Going away alone, baby?

01:15:44.286 --> 01:15:46.413
Boys, I want you to...

01:15:46.497 --> 01:15:48.957
get her something pretty to wear.

01:15:51.293 --> 01:15:54.086
We're going to a party tonight.

01:15:54.128 --> 01:15:56.881
We'll have one hell of a time, right?

01:15:58.424 --> 01:15:59.926
Get out of my sight.

01:16:01.135 --> 01:16:02.553
Jump up.

01:16:02.637 --> 01:16:03.846
Get up. Come on.

01:16:05.765 --> 01:16:08.601
Come on, Milo. Jump, please.

01:16:08.643 --> 01:16:10.813
Do it for Daddy.

01:16:14.566 --> 01:16:16.401
That's it!

01:16:17.778 --> 01:16:20.447
God, I can't believe it.

01:16:21.907 --> 01:16:24.619
Good boy. Good boy.

01:16:28.205 --> 01:16:29.623
See that man over there?

01:16:29.665 --> 01:16:31.291
He's got keys.

01:16:33.043 --> 01:16:34.877
Go get those keys.

01:16:34.961 --> 01:16:37.588
Go get them. Go get the keys.

01:16:40.008 --> 01:16:40.968
That's it.

01:16:42.344 --> 01:16:43.387
The key.

01:16:49.309 --> 01:16:51.520
No, not the cheese, the keys.

01:16:53.814 --> 01:16:55.733
Drop the cheese...

01:16:57.152 --> 01:16:58.611
and get the keys.

01:16:58.695 --> 01:17:01.280
Over there, over there.

01:17:19.423 --> 01:17:21.842
Oh, man. Come on.

01:17:21.884 --> 01:17:24.304
Come here. Good boy. That's a good boy.

01:17:25.472 --> 01:17:28.141
Give it, give me the keys.
Give me the keys.

01:17:28.224 --> 01:17:30.894
Come on, drop it, drop it.

01:17:30.977 --> 01:17:33.104
It's sundown.

01:17:33.187 --> 01:17:35.022
It's almost time.

01:17:37.274 --> 01:17:39.193
I wouldn't, darling.

01:17:40.445 --> 01:17:41.696
DANGER
EXPLOSIVES

01:17:41.738 --> 01:17:44.699
Wouldn't want to start the
celebration early.

01:18:29.495 --> 01:18:30.579
Hold it!

01:18:30.621 --> 01:18:32.414
I am warning you...

01:18:32.498 --> 01:18:34.749
I am seriously stressed out here.

01:18:34.791 --> 01:18:36.000
Easy.

01:18:36.084 --> 01:18:38.002
Come on.

01:18:38.086 --> 01:18:39.419
Don't be an idiot.

01:18:39.462 --> 01:18:44.092
You're in a police station. There is no
way you'll walk out of here like this.

01:18:45.593 --> 01:18:47.262
You're know, you're right.

01:18:49.931 --> 01:18:52.767
- Absolutely right.
- What are you doing?

01:18:54.060 --> 01:18:55.688
You'll take me out...

01:18:55.771 --> 01:18:57.523
as your prisoner.

01:18:57.606 --> 01:19:00.317
Put it on! Put it on!

01:19:01.902 --> 01:19:03.154
Come on.

01:19:03.237 --> 01:19:05.948
- I'm really very sorry about this.
- I'm sure.

01:19:08.993 --> 01:19:10.787
You got the wrong guy.

01:19:10.829 --> 01:19:12.289
It's a bum rap.

01:19:12.330 --> 01:19:14.039
I got my rights.

01:19:14.123 --> 01:19:16.082
Where are you taking Ipkiss?

01:19:16.166 --> 01:19:19.210
Ixnay! Ehay's otgay an ungay.

01:19:19.294 --> 01:19:22.755
I get it. Pig Latin, right?

01:19:22.839 --> 01:19:24.800
Eesay ouyay aterlay.

01:19:26.135 --> 01:19:27.344
Come on!

01:19:35.019 --> 01:19:37.605
Sit back and relax.

01:19:39.983 --> 01:19:42.486
I must change for the party.

01:19:52.578 --> 01:19:54.997
TONIGHT, CASINO

01:19:58.042 --> 01:20:00.669
WAR ORPHANS FUND

01:20:14.518 --> 01:20:15.477
I need cigarettes.

01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:17.854
- Which brand?
- It doesn't matter, I don't smoke.

01:20:17.938 --> 01:20:20.731
But for you, I would shoot
the Surgeon General.

01:20:22.107 --> 01:20:24.109
Mayor Tilton, may we have a word?

01:20:24.193 --> 01:20:28.573
I always have time for the press
and my loyal constituents.

01:21:04.651 --> 01:21:07.362
Let me out of these cuffs,
you drive like a maniac.

01:21:07.404 --> 01:21:09.823
Sorry, we're late for the ball.

01:21:09.907 --> 01:21:12.535
Alice and the rabbit'll be
disappointed.

01:21:12.618 --> 01:21:14.245
Now you're being cynical.

01:21:17.205 --> 01:21:18.290
Who are you?

01:21:18.373 --> 01:21:21.376
I'm just an ex-employee...

01:21:21.460 --> 01:21:24.045
who's come for his back pay.

01:21:24.129 --> 01:21:26.506
Or should I say payback?

01:21:30.260 --> 01:21:31.678
Kill him.

01:21:50.823 --> 01:21:52.158
Come on.

01:22:14.180 --> 01:22:15.640
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:22:15.681 --> 01:22:17.767
I will be the host...

01:22:17.850 --> 01:22:19.894
for the rest of the evening.

01:22:30.614 --> 01:22:32.990
Get your dog away from me.

01:22:34.325 --> 01:22:36.409
Sorry, he seems to be attracted to you.

01:22:36.493 --> 01:22:39.579
Where's everyone?
Something's not kosher.

01:22:39.663 --> 01:22:40.873
- Exactly.
- Watch it!

01:22:40.957 --> 01:22:42.166
Sorry.

01:22:42.250 --> 01:22:43.709
I must lock you in.

01:22:45.211 --> 01:22:47.421
Use the radio.

01:22:47.505 --> 01:22:50.842
You know, call for back-up
or something.

01:22:53.094 --> 01:22:56.723
This could be dangerous.
Stay here and be a good boy.

01:22:57.850 --> 01:23:00.602
Daddy has to go kick some ass.

01:23:05.314 --> 01:23:06.774
He's a dead man.

01:23:06.858 --> 01:23:09.694
Down! Get down!

01:23:10.737 --> 01:23:13.532
Take it easy, I got the point.

01:23:25.168 --> 01:23:26.086
Blow it!

01:23:34.178 --> 01:23:36.180
Bastard.

01:23:36.263 --> 01:23:37.930
What's the matter, darling?

01:23:38.014 --> 01:23:40.099
This is your big production number.

01:23:40.183 --> 01:23:42.561
And you know it's important...

01:23:42.603 --> 01:23:44.980
to go out with a big bang.

01:23:54.281 --> 01:23:55.782
Why are you here?

01:23:55.824 --> 01:23:59.328
Take this gun and start
sneaking people out the back.

01:24:03.373 --> 01:24:04.666
Step back.

01:24:04.750 --> 01:24:08.128
- Do you know who I am?
- A dead man if you don't step back.

01:24:08.212 --> 01:24:10.129
What about some respect?

01:24:10.213 --> 01:24:13.008
- What kind of thug are you?
- All set, Dorian.

01:24:14.968 --> 01:24:16.762
That's it.

01:24:18.096 --> 01:24:20.098
This party's over...

01:24:20.182 --> 01:24:22.100
in 10 minutes.

01:24:23.977 --> 01:24:26.147
This is the moment when a man...

01:24:26.231 --> 01:24:28.483
shows what he's really made of.

01:24:29.859 --> 01:24:30.819
Crap.

01:24:30.902 --> 01:24:32.695
Drop it.

01:24:45.165 --> 01:24:46.792
Smart dog.

01:24:53.090 --> 01:24:56.678
Boss, look who decided to crash
the party.

01:24:56.761 --> 01:24:59.055
How's it going?

01:24:59.139 --> 01:25:00.974
Bring him up here!

01:25:02.100 --> 01:25:04.394
Wait! No!

01:25:04.477 --> 01:25:08.064
This is no time for last requests.

01:25:08.148 --> 01:25:10.651
But all I wanted was a kiss.

01:25:10.734 --> 01:25:13.070
A kiss?

01:25:13.154 --> 01:25:15.114
Just one...

01:25:15.197 --> 01:25:17.197
Iast kiss.

01:25:17.281 --> 01:25:19.158
I can't shut it off.

01:25:20.367 --> 01:25:22.953
There's always time...

01:25:24.454 --> 01:25:26.916
for one last kiss.

01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:34.090
From the real Dorian.

01:25:35.300 --> 01:25:37.719
The one I used to love.

01:25:39.095 --> 01:25:41.182
Nobody ever kissed me
like Dorian Tyrel.

01:25:42.308 --> 01:25:43.225
Romeo!

01:25:43.309 --> 01:25:45.394
This place will blow!

01:25:45.478 --> 01:25:47.730
Just wait!

01:25:52.233 --> 01:25:54.194
I've decided...

01:26:02.577 --> 01:26:04.913
to give her one last thrill.

01:26:15.758 --> 01:26:17.259
Get it!

01:26:34.318 --> 01:26:35.860
Run, Milo!

01:26:39.405 --> 01:26:41.992
Stanley, hurry!

01:26:42.076 --> 01:26:43.661
Don't worry.

01:26:43.744 --> 01:26:45.538
It's all over now.

01:26:56.465 --> 01:26:57.466
Got you.

01:27:10.104 --> 01:27:11.690
I'll take you apart.

01:27:11.773 --> 01:27:16.026
I hope you can enjoy the victory
with one freaking eye!

01:27:33.919 --> 01:27:35.588
Good doggie.

01:27:35.671 --> 01:27:36.630
Good doggie.

01:27:56.401 --> 01:27:57.360
I'm winning!

01:28:21.426 --> 01:28:22.552
JACKPOT

01:28:35.857 --> 01:28:37.858
Oh, my God!

01:28:37.942 --> 01:28:40.110
This must be a new breed.

01:28:40.194 --> 01:28:41.696
Easy, boy!

01:28:45.575 --> 01:28:46.618
Good boy!

01:29:17.524 --> 01:29:19.317
Did you miss me?

01:29:27.076 --> 01:29:28.161
I guess not!

01:29:35.293 --> 01:29:38.629
Now, you have to ask yourself
one question:

01:29:38.713 --> 01:29:41.257
"Do I feel lucky?"

01:29:41.340 --> 01:29:42.300
Well...

01:29:45.052 --> 01:29:46.679
do you...

01:29:46.762 --> 01:29:48.389
punks?

01:30:22.673 --> 01:30:25.968
That's a spicy meatball.

01:30:33.852 --> 01:30:35.312
How do?

01:30:41.735 --> 01:30:44.279
This guy's incorrigible.

01:31:12.183 --> 01:31:14.394
You were good, kid, real good...

01:31:14.477 --> 01:31:18.063
but as long as I'm around
you'll be second-best.

01:31:38.876 --> 01:31:40.961
Police! Hands up!

01:31:42.255 --> 01:31:44.799
Officers, arrest those men.

01:31:44.883 --> 01:31:47.469
I've always wanted to say that.

01:31:50.513 --> 01:31:51.639
Come on.

01:31:53.015 --> 01:31:54.391
Give me that gun.

01:32:00.189 --> 01:32:03.317
He stole all our jewelry.
Take me to headquarters...

01:32:03.400 --> 01:32:05.360
Stop that man!

01:32:08.363 --> 01:32:09.740
I've got you now.

01:32:09.781 --> 01:32:11.910
Watch it, Chunky!

01:32:11.951 --> 01:32:14.913
- Mayor Tilton, I'm so--
- What's wrong with you?

01:32:14.996 --> 01:32:16.748
That man is The Mask.

01:32:16.789 --> 01:32:20.877
No. Dorian Tyrel was The Mask.
I saw it with my own eyes.

01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:23.087
This man here saved our lives.

01:32:23.129 --> 01:32:26.215
- With a little help.
- You're a real hero.

01:32:27.091 --> 01:32:28.802
It's nothing...

01:32:28.885 --> 01:32:30.929
any American with...

01:32:30.970 --> 01:32:34.265
balls of steel wouldn't do
for his community.

01:32:34.307 --> 01:32:36.434
Come on.

01:32:38.769 --> 01:32:40.896
Mayor Tilton, did you see that dog?

01:32:40.979 --> 01:32:43.858
Leave the dog alone.

01:32:43.942 --> 01:32:46.611
I want you in my office
first thing tomorrow.

01:32:46.694 --> 01:32:49.823
- Yes, Your Honor.
- That doesn't sound good at all.

01:32:49.906 --> 01:32:53.451
No, it doesn't.
What would sound good to you?

01:32:53.535 --> 01:32:55.787
- Breakfast.
- Shut up!

01:33:15.307 --> 01:33:17.267
Sure you know what you're doing?

01:33:19.686 --> 01:33:21.604
I'm sure.

01:33:21.688 --> 01:33:23.648
Then do what you must.

01:33:36.870 --> 01:33:39.080
Sure you won't miss this guy?

01:33:39.164 --> 01:33:42.501
When he's gone, all that's left is me.

01:34:26.922 --> 01:34:29.007
Smoking!

01:40:57.900 --> 01:41:00.444
THE MASK
