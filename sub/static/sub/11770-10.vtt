by
HOME BOX OFFICE

00:05.867 --> 00:09.833
A Division of TIME WARNER
ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY, L.P.

00:13.933 --> 00:16.967
It's something a Kentucky farmer
says she's never seen before.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.833
A hand taking newborn puppies
under her wing.

00:19.867 --> 00:22.967
SO, GUESS WHO CANCELED
LUNCH WITH ME AGAIN ?

00:23.000 --> 00:24.300
SUSIE GREENE.

00:24.333 --> 00:25.200
REALLY ?

00:25.233 --> 00:26.400
YEAH, AND THIS TIME,

00:26.433 --> 00:29.700
THE EXCUSE WAS SHE HAD
TO GO TO THE DENTIST.

00:29.733 --> 00:30.900
SO, SHE HAD TO GO
TO THE DENTIST.

00:30.933 --> 00:32.233
OKAY, THAT'S BULLSHIT.

00:32.267 --> 00:36.033
THAT'S LIKE THE ADULT EQUIVALENT
OF THE DOG ATE MY HOMEWORK.

00:36.067 --> 00:37.533
I'M NOT MAKING
ANYMORE DATES WITH HER.

00:37.567 --> 00:38.900
SHE'S DONE IT
TO ME BEFORE.

00:38.933 --> 00:40.500
I MEAN, IF SHE DOESN'T
WANT TO GO TO LUNCH,

00:40.533 --> 00:41.967
WHY DOESN'T SHE JUST SAY,
YOU KNOW WHAT,

00:42.000 --> 00:44.200
I'D RATHER NOT GO
TO LUNCH WITH YOU ?

00:44.233 --> 00:46.467
WELL, MAYBE SHE WAS
TELLING THE TRUTH.

00:46.500 --> 00:48.033
I DON'T THINK SO.

00:48.067 --> 00:50.100
( coughing )

00:50.133 --> 00:52.667
LISTEN, ARE YOU GOING
TO YOUR OFFICE TOMORROW ?

00:52.700 --> 00:54.933
CAN YOU DO ME
A FAVOR ?

00:54.967 --> 00:56.067
MAYBE.

00:56.100 --> 00:57.400
CAN'T YOU JUST
SAY YES ?

00:57.433 --> 00:58.467
NO.

00:58.500 --> 00:59.500
WHAT KIND OF FAVOR
AM I GONNA ASK YOU

00:59.533 --> 01:00.400
THAT YOU WOULDN'T
SAY YES TO ?

01:00.433 --> 01:01.700
WHAT DO YOU WANT ?

01:01.733 --> 01:04.733
WELL, I JUST SAW THE OSTEOPATH
TODAY ABOUT MY COUGH

01:04.767 --> 01:07.767
AND HE TOLD ME I SHOULD
GET SOME COLON CLEANSE.

01:07.800 --> 01:10.367
IT'S ACTUALLY CALLED
COLON CLEANSE.

01:10.400 --> 01:12.667
IT HELPS
THE WHOLE SYSTEM

01:12.700 --> 01:14.600
AND HE SAID IT WILL FLUSH,
LITERALLY FLUSH IT OUT.

01:14.633 --> 01:16.867
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE
TO DO WITH A COUGH ?

01:16.900 --> 01:18.067
I DON'T
UNDERSTAND THAT.

01:18.100 --> 01:21.067
BUT HE SAYS IT'LL
KNOCK IT OUT LIKE THAT.

01:21.067 --> 01:23.600
SO, PLEASE, WILL YOU
DO THAT FOR ME ?

01:23.633 --> 01:25.133
ALRIGHT.

01:25.167 --> 01:26.433
Speaking of good eating,

01:26.467 --> 01:28.767
here's Andy Portico with
this week's restaurant review.

01:28.800 --> 01:30.067
Andy ?

01:30.067 --> 01:32.067
OH, ANDY PORTICO'S
REVIEWING A NEW RESTAURANT.

01:32.067 --> 01:33.867
Today I'll be talking about
stuffing your face again.

01:33.900 --> 01:36.200
I don't think I've eaten as
badly since I was in the army

01:36.233 --> 01:37.467
and at least then
I had my youth.

01:37.500 --> 01:38.833
ASSHOLE.

01:38.867 --> 01:40.433
... people could've learned
something from army food.

01:40.467 --> 01:41.367
OH MY GOD.

01:41.400 --> 01:43.100
I'd rather eat
"C" Rations...

01:43.133 --> 01:44.200
THIS GUY IS
SO BRUTAL.

01:44.233 --> 01:45.700
than the swill they serve
in this place.

01:45.733 --> 01:48.467
It's a criminal enterprise,
not a restaurant

01:48.500 --> 01:49.633
and all these people
should be...

01:49.667 --> 01:51.733
THIS PLACE IS GONNA
BE CLOSED IN TWO DAYS.

01:51.767 --> 01:53.100
ALL BECAUSE OF THIS.

01:53.133 --> 01:54.900
HE'S COMING TO THE OPENING
NEXT WEEK.

01:54.933 --> 01:56.067
REALLY ?
YEAH.

01:56.067 --> 01:57.467
BUT YOU REPAIRED
ALL THE...

01:57.500 --> 01:59.233
ALL THE DIGGING, YEAH,
SHH, QUIET.

01:59.267 --> 02:03.633
I'm gonna have to give it
a big two thumbs down.

02:03.667 --> 02:05.067
WHAT A SURPRISE !

02:05.100 --> 02:06.733
I'm Andy Portico,
thanks for watching.

02:06.767 --> 02:08.067
ISN'T THAT CLEVER ?

02:08.067 --> 02:08.633
YEAH.

02:08.667 --> 02:10.333
THE THUMBS DOWN.

02:10.367 --> 02:13.733
IT'S REAL ORIGINAL,
THE THUMBS DOWN.

02:15.100 --> 02:17.367
I MEAN, IT'S REALLY AWFUL
THAT THIS GUY'S, YOU KNOW,

02:17.400 --> 02:19.500
HE'S CONTROLLING THE FATE
OF OUR RESTAURANT PRACTICALLY.

02:19.533 --> 02:21.300
I KNOW, IT'S SO SUBJECTIVE,
ISN'T IT ?

02:21.333 --> 02:22.367
IT'S TERRIBLE.

02:22.400 --> 02:23.500
HOW DOES HE DECIDE ?

02:23.533 --> 02:25.667
GUY COULDN'T
GET DATES.

02:25.700 --> 02:28.333
HE TAKES IT OUT ON
THE REST OF THE WORLD.

02:28.367 --> 02:31.500
I COULDN'T GET DATES, YOU DON'T
SEE ME TAKING IT OUT ON ANYBODY.

02:31.533 --> 02:32.933
OH, REALLY ?
YEAH.

02:32.967 --> 02:34.600
I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THAT.

02:34.633 --> 02:37.200
BUT, LISTEN, DON'T YOU KNOW
SOMEBODY WHO KNOWS HIM ?

02:37.233 --> 02:38.467
COULD PUT
IN A GOOD WORD.

02:38.500 --> 02:39.533
YOU KNOW,
JEFF'S DAUGHTER

02:39.567 --> 02:41.467
ACTUALLY GOES TO
THE SAME SCHOOL AS HIS SON.

02:41.500 --> 02:43.900
OH, THAT'S
A START, RIGHT ?

02:43.933 --> 02:46.067
AH, JEFF'S NOT
GONNA SAY ANYTHING.

02:46.067 --> 02:48.467
( coughing )

02:49.067 --> 02:50.467
GOODNIGHT.

02:50.500 --> 02:53.300
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU KISSING ME
GOODNIGHT FOR WITH THAT COUGH ?

02:53.333 --> 02:55.733
CAN YOU GET
THE LIGHTS PLEASE ?

02:57.567 --> 02:59.433
YOU KNOW HOW BOOKSTORES
MAKE YOU FEEL STUPID ?

02:59.467 --> 03:00.867
YEAH.

03:00.900 --> 03:03.233
WELL, HEALTH FOOD STORES
REALLY MAKE ME FEEL UNHEALTHY.

03:03.267 --> 03:05.233
HEY, WHAT'S THIS BULLSHIT,
BY THE WAY ?

03:05.267 --> 03:07.600
SUSIE MAKING UP THIS STORY
ABOUT GOING TO THE DENTIST.

03:07.633 --> 03:09.367
SHE HAD A DENTIST
APPOINTMENT.

03:09.400 --> 03:12.367
WELL, 'CAUSE CHERYL DOESN'T
BELIEVE A WORD OF IT.

03:12.400 --> 03:13.767
I WAS WITH HER.

03:13.800 --> 03:15.233
YEAH, SHE KEEPS BREAKING
THESE APPOINTMENTS WITH CHERYL.

03:15.267 --> 03:17.700
I WAS WITH HER,
WHAT DO YOU WANT ?

03:17.733 --> 03:19.100
I CAN'T FIND
THIS COLON CLEANSER.

03:19.133 --> 03:20.267
ASK SOMEBODY.

03:20.300 --> 03:22.433
WE'VE BEEN UP AND DOWN
THE STORE 10 TIMES.

03:22.467 --> 03:23.800
ASK SOMEBODY,
THAT'S WHY.

03:23.833 --> 03:25.600
YEAH ?
EXCUSE ME.

03:25.633 --> 03:27.600
I'M LOOKING FOR
A COLON CLEANSER.

03:27.633 --> 03:29.400
OH, ADAM ?

03:29.433 --> 03:30.567
WHERE'S THE COLON
CLEANSE ?

03:30.600 --> 03:31.367
THE WHAT ?

03:31.400 --> 03:32.700

03:32.733 --> 03:35.867
COLON CLEANSE IS AISLE "G",
IT'S RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

03:35.900 --> 03:37.067
OH, OKAY.

03:37.067 --> 03:39.367
IT'S JUST RIGHT AROUND
THE CORNER, RIGHT THERE.

03:39.400 --> 03:42.567
IT'S FOR MY WIFE,
IT'S FOR MY WIFE.

03:50.400 --> 03:52.133
WHO'S THAT GUY ?

03:52.167 --> 03:54.233
I DON'T KNOW.

03:54.267 --> 03:57.133
BOY, DOES HE
LOOK FAMILIAR.

03:58.633 --> 04:00.300
DOES HE NOT LOOK
FAMILIAR TO YOU ?

04:00.333 --> 04:01.967
WHO'S THAT ?

04:02.067 --> 04:04.367
I KNOW THAT.

04:05.200 --> 04:07.233
THE CHEF,
THAT'S OUR CHEF.

04:07.267 --> 04:09.067
OUR CHEF'S BALD.

04:10.533 --> 04:12.767
THAT'S THE CHEF.

04:14.967 --> 04:16.533
HEY !

04:18.300 --> 04:21.100
HEY, LARRY.

04:21.133 --> 04:22.667

04:22.700 --> 04:24.533
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

04:26.633 --> 04:28.100

04:29.567 --> 04:31.167
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU DIDN'T WANT...

04:31.200 --> 04:32.567
WELL, YEAH, I DID, UH...

04:32.600 --> 04:33.833
CAME INTO
THE INTERVIEW.

04:33.867 --> 04:34.867
YES.

04:34.900 --> 04:38.633
I JUST ASSUMED
AND I WAS RIGHT THAT

04:38.667 --> 04:40.867
YOU WERE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE
WHO FIND THAT MEN

04:40.900 --> 04:42.867
WHO ENHANCE THEIR APPEARANCE
ARE WRONG AND STUPID

04:42.900 --> 04:45.433
SO, I TOOK
MY TOUPEE OFF.

04:45.467 --> 04:49.200
YOU CAME IN BALD
JUST TO GET THE JOB ?

04:51.333 --> 04:53.300
I'M SORRY
I DECEIVED YOU.

04:53.333 --> 04:56.767
I HOPE THIS DOESN'T, YOU KNOW,
AFFECT, YOU KNOW...

04:56.800 --> 04:59.100
WELL, I'M SORRY,
BUT IT WILL.

04:59.133 --> 05:01.667
YOU GOT HIRED
UNDER FALSE PRETENSES.

05:01.700 --> 05:03.200
BUT IT HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH MY FOOD THOUGH.

05:03.233 --> 05:04.733
I KNOW, BUT I DON'T
TRUST YOU.

05:04.767 --> 05:06.067
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT ?

05:06.100 --> 05:08.200
NO, I'M SORRY.

05:08.233 --> 05:11.167
YOU OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED
OF YOURSELF, LET'S GO.

05:16.633 --> 05:18.233
I MEAN, WHAT WAS
HE THINKING ?

05:18.267 --> 05:20.200
THAT FOR THE NEXT
FIVE YEARS,

05:20.233 --> 05:21.367
WAS HE GONNA COME
INTO WORK EVERYDAY

05:21.400 --> 05:22.867
AND LEAVE THE TOUPEE
AT HOME ?

05:22.900 --> 05:24.067
YEAH, RIGHT.

05:24.067 --> 05:24.967
JUST WEAR IT
ON WEEKENDS.

05:25.067 --> 05:26.800
LIVE A DOUBLE LIFE.

05:26.833 --> 05:28.400
UNBELIEVABLE.

05:28.433 --> 05:29.633
HE HAD NO PLAN.

05:29.667 --> 05:31.067
HE HAD A GOOD PLAN.

05:31.067 --> 05:32.100
HE KNEW HOW
TO GET HIRED.

05:32.133 --> 05:34.567
OH, LIKE YOU WOULDN'T
HIRE A FAT GUY, HUH ?

05:34.600 --> 05:37.300
YOU DON'T HAVE A PROCLIVITY
FOR FAT PEOPLE ?

05:37.333 --> 05:39.933
I THINK YOU GOT A STRONG
PROCLIVITY FOR FAT PEOPLE.

05:39.967 --> 05:42.233
IF A FAT GUY CAME IN,
YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO HIRE HIM ?

05:42.267 --> 05:44.533
YOU WOULD'VE BEEN
ALL OVER THAT FAT GUY.

05:44.567 --> 05:46.633
YOU WOULD'VE LOVED
THAT FAT GUY, DON'T TELL ME.

05:46.667 --> 05:48.367
ALL THINGS BEING EQUAL,
I'D HIRE THE FAT GUY.

05:48.400 --> 05:49.633
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

05:49.667 --> 05:51.500
AND, BY THE WAY, IT'S NOT
LIKE I DON'T HIRE OTHER PEOPLE

05:51.533 --> 05:53.100
WHO AREN'T BALD, OKAY ?

05:53.133 --> 05:54.400
I DON'T HAVE
A BALD MANAGER.

05:54.433 --> 05:56.167
I DON'T HAVE
A BALD LAWYER.

05:56.200 --> 05:58.067
YEAH, YOU HAVE
A BALD ACCOUNTANT,

05:58.067 --> 06:01.800
A BALD UROLOGIST,
A BALD TRAVEL AGENT.

06:01.833 --> 06:04.067
YOU HAVE FAR MORE
BALD PROFESSIONALS

06:04.067 --> 06:05.067
THAN THE AVERAGE PERSON.

06:05.100 --> 06:06.833
OKAY, SO I DO,
SO, SO WHAT ?

06:06.867 --> 06:08.500
WELL, I JUST
WANT YOU TO NOTICE.

06:08.533 --> 06:10.067
OKAY, I NOTICE,
IT'S DULY NOTED.

06:10.067 --> 06:11.833
ALRIGHT, I KNEW YOU'D SAY
DULY NOTED, TOO.

06:11.867 --> 06:13.267
OH, DID YOU,
OH, YOU'RE SO SMART.

06:13.300 --> 06:14.300
I KNEW.

06:14.333 --> 06:16.300
YOU KNOW EVERYTHING
I SAY BEFORE I SAY IT.

06:16.333 --> 06:17.433
BEFORE YOU SAY IT.

06:17.467 --> 06:18.333
OH, WHAT A GENIUS
YOU ARE.

06:18.367 --> 06:19.700
OH, WHAT A GENIUS
YOU ARE.

06:19.733 --> 06:20.700
OH, YOU KNEW I WAS GONNA
SAY TO THAT, TOO ?

06:20.733 --> 06:21.633
I KNEW YOU WERE
GONNA SAY THAT, TOO.

06:21.667 --> 06:22.767
OH, I KNEW YOU WERE
GONNA SAY THAT.

06:22.800 --> 06:25.267
I KNEW YOU WERE
GONNA SAY THAT.

06:26.067 --> 06:27.067
AW, JEEZ.

06:27.067 --> 06:28.067
ALRIGHT, LISTEN,

06:28.067 --> 06:29.733
WE ARE IN SO MUCH
TROUBLE HERE, OH MY GOD.

06:29.767 --> 06:31.500
I GOT TO TELL
THESE INVESTORS NOW...

06:31.533 --> 06:34.067
WHAT JUST HAPPENED,
WE HAVE NO CHEF.

06:34.067 --> 06:35.500
THIS JUST STINKS.

06:35.533 --> 06:37.233
YEAH, WOW,
YOU GOT TO TELL THEM.

06:37.267 --> 06:38.767
I'LL BE THERE WITH YOU,
BUT YOU GOT TO TELL THEM.

06:38.800 --> 06:40.900
WE OPEN IN FOUR DAYS,
NO CHEF.

06:40.933 --> 06:43.067
AND YOU'RE GONNA TELL THEM
YOU JUST FIRED OUR CHEF

06:43.067 --> 06:44.700
BECAUSE HE WEARS
A TOUPEE.

06:44.733 --> 06:46.500
LISTEN, I GOT TO GO
TO SAMMY'S SCHOOL,

06:46.533 --> 06:48.567
DROP OFF HER LUNCH, AND THEN
I'LL TAKE YOU TO YOUR OFFICE.

06:56.400 --> 06:57.900
I DON'T UNDERSTAND,
YOUR DAUGHTER GOES HERE ?

06:57.933 --> 06:58.967
I SEE OLDER KIDS.

06:59.067 --> 07:00.767

07:00.800 --> 07:04.667
OH, OH DEAR,

07:04.700 --> 07:07.467
POOR KID LOST HIS HAIR,
HE'S GETTING CHEMO.

07:07.500 --> 07:09.733
NO, NO, HE'S NOT GOING
THROUGH CHEMOTHERAPY.

07:09.767 --> 07:12.567
ANOTHER KID IN CLASS IS

07:12.600 --> 07:14.433
IN THE SENIOR CLASS,
AS A SHOW OF SOLIDARITY,

07:14.467 --> 07:15.467
HAVE SHAVED
THEIR HEADS.

07:15.500 --> 07:17.800
YEAH.

07:20.767 --> 07:22.833
THAT'S REALLY
SOMETHING.

07:22.867 --> 07:24.800

MAYBE...

07:24.833 --> 07:26.867
MAYBE ONE DAY
I'LL GET A CHANCE TO DO

07:26.900 --> 07:29.067
SOMETHING GOOD FOR
SOMEBODY LIKE THAT.

07:29.100 --> 07:30.433
IT'S REALLY
TOUCHING.

07:30.467 --> 07:32.667
YOU'VE ALREADY GOT LIKE KIND
OF A HEAD START ACTUALLY.

07:34.667 --> 07:36.700
HA, FUNNY.

07:39.933 --> 07:41.900
WHAT'S ALL THIS ?

07:41.933 --> 07:44.400

07:55.633 --> 07:57.667
HAVE YOU EVER TALKED TO HIM
ABOUT THE RESTAURANT ?

07:57.700 --> 07:59.500
NO, I WOULDN'T DARE.

07:59.533 --> 08:02.200
I USED TO LOVE
PLAYING DODGE BALL.

08:02.233 --> 08:03.233
YOU LIKE
PLAYING DODGE BALL ?

08:03.267 --> 08:04.333

08:09.600 --> 08:10.467
I'M NOT GONNA
ASK THEM.

08:10.500 --> 08:11.800

08:57.067 --> 08:57.833

08:57.867 --> 08:58.667
IT'S BULLSHIT !

08:58.700 --> 08:59.367
HIT THE GROUND.

08:59.400 --> 09:00.300
GET OUT OF THERE !

09:00.333 --> 09:01.367

09:15.700 --> 09:19.467
WHAT THE FUCK ?

09:21.100 --> 09:23.067
SORRY.

09:24.500 --> 09:27.133
HOW COULD THIS
POSSIBLY HAPPEN ?

09:27.167 --> 09:28.967
WHAT WERE YOU DOING PLAYING
DODGE BALL WITH ANDY PORTICO ?

09:29.067 --> 09:31.100
ADULTS WERE PLAYING,
OKAY ?

09:31.133 --> 09:32.900
IT WAS
A PARENTS/KIDS GAME.

09:32.933 --> 09:33.967
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU,
WHAT ARE YOU,

09:34.067 --> 09:35.200
WHAT ARE YOU SWINGING
SO HARD FOR ?

09:35.233 --> 09:36.500
WHAT, YOU'RE INJURING HIM,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?

09:36.533 --> 09:38.100
I GOT INVOLVED
IN THE GAME.

09:38.133 --> 09:39.900
HE WAS ACTING LIKE A BIT OF
AN ASSHOLE, TOO, BY THE WAY.

09:39.933 --> 09:41.300
IT WASN'T
ALL MY FAULT.

09:41.333 --> 09:43.233
WHAT ABOUT
THE COOK ?

09:43.267 --> 09:46.167
WE OPEN IN THREE DAYS,
WE DON'T HAVE A CHEF.

09:46.200 --> 09:48.067
WELL, THE GUY
WAS FULL OF SHIT.

09:48.067 --> 09:50.067
HE TRIED TO PASS HIMSELF OFF
AS BALD AND HE WASN'T BALD.

09:50.100 --> 09:51.367
WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO DO ?

09:51.400 --> 09:53.267
SO, BIG DEAL, SO, HE WEARS
A TOUPEE WHEN HE'S NOT HERE.

09:53.300 --> 09:54.467
WHO CARES ?

09:54.500 --> 09:57.167
'CAUSE HE'S LIAR,
THE GUY'S A BALD-FACED...

09:57.200 --> 09:59.500
LITERALLY,
A BALD-FACED LIAR.

09:59.533 --> 10:01.767
WE'VE GOT MORE
PROBLEMS THAN THAT.

10:01.800 --> 10:03.767
WE HAVE
LOST INVESTORS.

10:03.800 --> 10:04.733
TED'S GONE.
HUGH'S GONE.

10:04.767 --> 10:06.233
TED DANSON
IS GONE.

10:06.267 --> 10:08.833
OKAY, BUT I MADE UP THAT MONEY,
YOU KNOW THAT, SO WHAT IS SO ?

10:08.867 --> 10:11.267
WE ARE TRYING TO
OPEN A RESTAURANT.

10:11.300 --> 10:14.400
YOU'VE GOT TO PULL US
OUT OF THIS MIRE

10:14.433 --> 10:15.733
THAT WE ARE
WALLOWING IN.

10:15.767 --> 10:17.800
WHAT ABOUT THE MUCK,
ARE WE IN ANY MUCK ?

10:17.833 --> 10:19.233
WE ARE, OH,
WE'RE IN A BIG MUCK.

10:19.267 --> 10:21.067
WE DON'T HAVE A CHEF.

10:21.100 --> 10:23.467
WELL, IF WE'RE IN MIRE, I WOULD
ASSUME THAT WE'RE ALSO IN MUCK.

10:23.500 --> 10:25.067
USUALLY ONE IS
IN MUCK AND MIRE.

10:25.100 --> 10:26.867
AND HE JUST SAID
I WAS IN A MIRE.

10:26.900 --> 10:28.467
AND I WAS JUST
TRYING TO ASCERTAIN

10:28.500 --> 10:29.867
WHETHER OR NOT MUCK
WAS INVOLVED AS WELL.

10:29.900 --> 10:30.767
YOU WERE TRYING
TO ASCERTAIN ?

10:30.800 --> 10:31.767
YES.

10:31.800 --> 10:33.533
LET'S NOT CHANGE
THE SUBJECT BECAUSE I...

10:33.567 --> 10:34.767
ASCERTAIN.

10:34.800 --> 10:36.867
YOU KNOW, ALL OF
THIS IS MOOT

10:36.900 --> 10:39.800
BECAUSE AFTER WHAT
HE DID TO PORTICO, OKAY,

10:39.833 --> 10:41.933
HE'S GONNA
SLAUGHTER US, OKAY ?

10:41.967 --> 10:44.200
HE'S GONNA PUT HIS THUMBS
THROUGH THE TABLE.

10:44.233 --> 10:46.167
APOLOGIZE TO PORTICO.

10:46.200 --> 10:47.633
OH, YOU KNOW,
I'LL APOLOGIZE.

10:47.667 --> 10:48.633
IT'S NOT GONNA,
IT'S NOT GONNA...

10:48.667 --> 10:50.933
APOLOGIZE TO PORTICO,
THAT'S IT.

10:50.967 --> 10:52.133
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL,
LARRY ?

10:52.167 --> 10:54.933
I'M SORRY,
I'M SORRY.

10:54.967 --> 10:57.600
ALRIGHT, I'LL GO APOLOGIZE,
LET'S TALK ABOUT A NEW CHEF.

10:57.633 --> 10:59.300
EVERYBODY'S GOT A...

10:59.333 --> 11:01.333
YOU KNOW, TED KNEW
ANOTHER GUY, NEVERMIND.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.833
( knocking )

11:09.867 --> 11:12.167
OH, LARRY.

11:12.200 --> 11:13.400
ANDY.

11:13.433 --> 11:15.567
YEAH, YOU KNOW, I'D GET UP
AND SHAKE YOUR HAND

11:15.600 --> 11:18.733
EXCEPT I DON'T REALLY HAVE
ANY HANDS TO SHAKE, YOU KNOW ?

11:18.767 --> 11:20.267
OH MY GOSH.

11:20.300 --> 11:23.100
WELL, THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU BREAK YOUR THUMBS.

11:23.133 --> 11:25.533
OH, GOD ALMIGHTY.

11:25.567 --> 11:26.533
AND I'M A FUCKING
MUPPET.

11:26.567 --> 11:28.600
I'M SO SORRY, ANDY.

11:28.633 --> 11:30.067
I'M SORRY, TOO.

11:30.067 --> 11:33.067
WE WERE PLAYING A GAME AND I,
WE WERE INTO IT AND--

11:33.067 --> 11:35.767
AND YOU THREW THE THING LIKE IT
WAS A FUCKING HYDROGEN BOMB.

11:35.800 --> 11:37.967
I JUST, YOU KNOW,
I HADN'T PLAYED IN A LONG TIME

11:38.067 --> 11:39.500
AND I WAS
HAVING FUN AND...

11:39.533 --> 11:44.367
WELL, I WON'T BE ABLE TO REVIEW
THE RESTAURANT, OF COURSE.

11:44.400 --> 11:46.500
WHY NOT ?

11:46.533 --> 11:49.233
BECAUSE I CAN'T DO
THUMBS UP, THUMBS DOWN.

11:49.267 --> 11:50.500
THAT'S MY WHOLE
GIMMICK.

11:50.533 --> 11:53.067
I CAN'T DO THE SHOW FOR
TWO MONTHS, WHAT AM I GONNA DO ?

11:53.100 --> 11:54.067
I CAN'T DO THIS...

11:54.067 --> 11:55.200
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T...

11:55.233 --> 11:57.467
BECAUSE I CAN'T
DO MY SHTICK.

11:57.500 --> 12:00.133
OH, WHAT A SHAME.

12:00.167 --> 12:01.167
YEAH, WELL.

12:01.200 --> 12:04.533
I CAN'T DO
THUMBS UP, THUMBS DOWN.

12:04.567 --> 12:06.067
YOU CAN'T
GO LIKE THIS.

12:06.100 --> 12:07.100
I CAN'T GO
LIKE THIS.

12:07.133 --> 12:08.900
FROM A STUPID
DODGE BALL GAME.

12:08.933 --> 12:11.633
FROM A STUPID
DODGE BALL GAME.

12:11.667 --> 12:13.767
WELL, IN ANY EVENT,
IT'S A SHAME THAT

12:13.800 --> 12:15.733
YOU'RE GONNA MISS
THE OPENING OF THE RESTAURANT.

12:15.767 --> 12:17.200
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
BE ABLE TO REVIEW IT.

12:17.233 --> 12:18.967
AND, WHAT AM I TALKING
ABOUT OPENING ?

12:19.067 --> 12:21.667
THERE'S NO OPENING ANY WAY
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A CHEF.

12:21.700 --> 12:22.700
YOU LOST YOUR CHEF ?

12:22.733 --> 12:23.967

12:48.967 --> 12:49.900

IN A WORD FOR YOU.

12:51.767 --> 12:52.833

12:52.867 --> 12:54.667

CREDIBILITY WITH HIM.

12:54.700 --> 12:57.533
WELL, THIS IS, I DON'T

12:57.567 --> 12:58.767

14:10.700 --> 14:13.367
AND THAT PROBLEM
IS WITH SALMON.

14:13.400 --> 14:16.967
I WON'T BUY IT,

14:17.067 --> 14:18.367

14:22.800 --> 14:24.233
WELL, WE WON'T
HAVE SALMON, RIGHT ?

14:24.267 --> 14:26.167

SALMON'S OUT.

14:27.567 --> 14:28.567
PLENTY OF FISH

WHO NEEDS IT ?

14:29.267 --> 14:32.067

14:32.067 --> 14:34.567
I CAN'T STAND
CAPERS EITHER.

14:34.600 --> 14:35.600
I DON'T LIKE THEM.

14:35.633 --> 14:37.267
IF I SEE ONE CAPER
IN THE KITCHEN,

14:37.300 --> 14:39.067
THERE'S GOING
TO BE BIG PROBLEM.

14:39.100 --> 14:40.167
UH-HUH, OKAY.

16:02.733 --> 16:05.767
IT TAKES TWO MINUTES.

16:05.800 --> 16:08.333
I JUST DON'T WANT ANOTHER
FALLING OUT WITH HER.

16:28.533 --> 16:30.500
LISTEN TO HOW LOW
MY VOICE IS TODAY.

16:30.533 --> 16:34.500
OH, HEY,

16:34.533 --> 16:36.667
I'M STARTING TO GET
STOMACH CRAMPS.

16:36.700 --> 16:37.633
DOWN, DOWN.

16:37.667 --> 16:39.067

COLON CLEANSE.

16:39.067 --> 16:39.967
HEAR THAT NOTE ?

16:40.067 --> 16:41.067

16:41.067 --> 16:43.867
OUTSTANDING.

16:43.900 --> 16:46.933
AND THEY ARE MILES.

16:46.967 --> 16:49.700
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK
THIS IS GONNA LAST ?

16:49.733 --> 16:52.633
I THINK I HAVE TO FIND
A BATHROOM PRETTY SOON.

16:52.667 --> 16:54.633
IT'S REALLY, LIKE...

16:54.667 --> 16:56.167
HEY, WHAT'S THE DEAL HERE,

16:56.200 --> 16:58.567

SUPPOSED TO TAKE ?

17:02.067 --> 17:03.067

17:03.067 --> 17:05.933

17:05.967 --> 17:07.600

17:44.367 --> 17:46.233
I GOT TO GO,

18:20.633 --> 18:21.767

18:21.800 --> 18:22.933
IT'S AN--

18:22.967 --> 18:24.533
THEY NEED TO TURN IT
OFF OR SOMETHING.

18:24.567 --> 18:26.233
TURN OFF
YOUR CAR WASH !

18:26.267 --> 18:28.933
I CAN'T HEAR A WORD
YOU'RE SAYING.

18:28.967 --> 18:30.833
TURN OFF
YOUR CAR WASH !

18:30.867 --> 18:31.967
ALRIGHT, WHAT ARE
THEY SAYING ?

18:32.067 --> 18:34.567

18:34.600 --> 18:38.267

18:55.433 --> 18:57.933
I'M JUST SAYING
SUSIE'S CRAZED, MAN.

18:57.967 --> 18:59.267
SHE HUNG UP
ON CHERYL.

18:59.300 --> 19:02.600
A CAR WASH, WHO GETS
STUCK IN A CAR WASH ?

19:02.633 --> 19:04.067
IT'S THE TRUTH.

19:04.100 --> 19:05.300
WE WERE STUCK
IN A CAR WASH.

19:05.333 --> 19:06.600
YOU WEREN'T
STUCK IN A CAR WASH.

19:06.633 --> 19:08.367
THE CAR GOT STUCK
IN ONE SPOT

19:08.400 --> 19:10.533
AND SHE GOT OUT
AND SHE WAS SOAKING WET.

19:10.567 --> 19:11.733
THAT'S WHY
SHE CANCELED.

19:11.767 --> 19:12.500
YOU'RE TELLING ME
THE TRUTH ?

19:12.533 --> 19:13.133
I'M TELLING YOU
THE TRUTH.

19:13.167 --> 19:14.800
I BELIEVE YOU.

19:14.833 --> 19:16.333
BUT, SUSIE'S NEVER
GONNA BELIEVE ANY OF THIS.

19:16.367 --> 19:17.567
WELL, WHATEVER,
YOU KNOW.

19:17.600 --> 19:20.567
SO, LET ME ASK YOU.

19:20.600 --> 19:23.067
ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT
ANYTHING THAT YOU WANT

19:23.067 --> 19:24.167
TO PUT DOWN
ON THE TABLE,

19:24.200 --> 19:26.533
LIKE, BEFORE
PEOPLE COME IN ?

19:26.567 --> 19:28.067
WHEN THEY FIRST
SIT DOWN ?

19:28.067 --> 19:32.067
DO YOU WANT TO HAVE LIKE BREAD
OR SOMETHING OR BREADSTICKS ?

19:32.067 --> 19:33.633
UM, OLIVES.

19:33.667 --> 19:34.967
LIKE A PICKLE.

19:35.067 --> 19:37.400
OLIVES, NO, I'M SORRY
FOR INTERRUPTION BUT IS NOT--

19:37.433 --> 19:39.467
THEY ARE REALLY
RIDICULOUS, OLIVES.

19:39.500 --> 19:40.867
WHAT DO YOU
DO WITH PIT ?

19:40.900 --> 19:43.333
EVER, NEVER, YOU CAN
DO NOTHING WITH PIT.

19:43.367 --> 19:44.200
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

19:44.233 --> 19:45.867
NO, OLIVES,
I'M SORRY...

19:45.900 --> 19:47.867
PUT IN A PIT PLATE
OR AN ASH TRAY OR SOMETHING.

19:47.900 --> 19:49.067
A PIT PLATE,
ASH TRAY, PIT,

19:49.100 --> 19:51.967
WHY DON'T YOU JUST CALL IT
A GARBAGE PLATE ?

19:52.067 --> 19:53.267
OKAY.

19:53.300 --> 19:55.267
YEAH, HE'S RIGHT.

19:55.300 --> 19:57.600
THE PERSONALITY
ON THIS GUY, HUH ?

19:57.633 --> 19:58.700
HE'S A PIECE OF WORK.

19:58.733 --> 19:59.700
OKAY.

19:59.733 --> 20:04.000
CARROT STICKS,
CELERY.

20:04.033 --> 20:06.133
WHAT ABOUT LEMON,
LEMON IN THE WATER ?

20:06.167 --> 20:07.033
THAT'S GOOD.

20:07.067 --> 20:09.167
MOTHERFUCKING
COCKSUCKER ASSHOLE !

20:17.700 --> 20:22.133
I'M STARTING TO THINK
THAT THAT'S INVOLUNTARY.

20:22.167 --> 20:24.933
VIOLA, EVERYTHING
IS FINISHED NOW.

20:24.967 --> 20:26.733
IT'S PERFECT,
IT'S FANTASTIC, OKAY ?

20:26.767 --> 20:28.133
I JUST WANT TO SAY
ONE THING THAT'S,

20:28.167 --> 20:30.467
I AM SO HUMBLED
TO BE WORKING

20:30.500 --> 20:32.433
IN SUCH A RESTAURANT
OF QUALITY, HUH ?

20:32.467 --> 20:33.667
IT'S FANTASTIC.

20:33.700 --> 20:34.900
OH, IT'S AN HONOR.

20:34.933 --> 20:37.467
BYE BYE, I SEE YOU
TOMORROW, YES ?

20:37.500 --> 20:39.133
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

20:41.433 --> 20:43.267
WHAT DO THEY CALL THAT,
TOURETTE'S ?

20:43.300 --> 20:44.300
TOURETTE'S SYNDROME.

20:44.333 --> 20:45.233
WOW.

20:45.267 --> 20:46.533
HE'S GOT
TOURETTE'S SYNDROME.

20:46.567 --> 20:48.667
PORTICO.

20:48.700 --> 20:51.100
PORTICO.

20:51.133 --> 20:55.067
PORTICO.

20:55.100 --> 20:56.067
PORTICO.

20:56.100 --> 20:58.733
FUCKING PORTICO !

20:58.767 --> 21:00.067
THAT PRICK,
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

21:00.067 --> 21:01.533
HE'S LAUGHING
RIGHT NOW.

21:01.567 --> 21:03.200
THAT MOTHERFUCKER.

21:03.233 --> 21:05.967
YOU BELIEVE THAT GUY WOULD DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT ON PURPOSE ?

21:06.067 --> 21:07.200
OF COURSE HE WOULD.

21:07.233 --> 21:10.300
THE JOKE'S ON US 'CAUSE
WE NEED TO FIND ANOTHER CHEF.

21:10.333 --> 21:11.333
YEAH, WE GOT
TO LET HIM GO.

21:11.367 --> 21:13.267
WE OPEN TOMORROW,
YOU WANT TO LET HIM GO ?

21:13.300 --> 21:14.733
IT, NO, BUT IT
WOULD BE DIFFERENT

21:14.767 --> 21:17.167
IF THE KITCHEN WASN'T, DIDN'T
LOOK OUT ONTO THE DINING ROOM.

21:17.200 --> 21:18.700
IF IT WAS A,
YOU KNOW...

21:18.733 --> 21:20.233
HE'S ON, PRACTICALLY
ON STAGE OVER THERE.

21:20.267 --> 21:22.367
IT'S THE DESIGN
OF THIS ROOM.

21:22.400 --> 21:23.533
IT'S LIKE A FLOOR SHOW.

21:23.567 --> 21:25.300
WE'RE GONNA BE KNOWN
AS THE RESTAURANT,

21:25.333 --> 21:27.200
THE CHEF THAT SWEARS.

21:27.233 --> 21:30.600
THIS IS A NIGHTMARE,
THIS'LL RUIN US.

21:30.633 --> 21:32.433
WE'RE GONNA BE A LAUGHING STOCK
IF WE ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN.

21:32.467 --> 21:33.333
ARE YOU KIDDING ME ?

21:33.367 --> 21:34.433
WE HAVE TO GET
RID OF HIM.

21:34.467 --> 21:36.067
NO.

21:36.067 --> 21:36.867
WHAT DO YOU
MEAN NO ?

21:36.900 --> 21:37.933
WE CAN'T FIRE HIM.

21:37.967 --> 21:38.900
WHY ?
WHY ?

21:38.933 --> 21:40.767
HE'S A SURVIVOR.

21:44.733 --> 21:48.067
AND THEN I CALLED MARTINES,
YOU KNOW THAT'S THE RESTAURANT

21:48.067 --> 21:49.433
WHERE HE USED
TO WORK IN NEW YORK.

21:49.467 --> 21:51.067
OKAY.

21:51.100 --> 21:54.700
AND THEY TOLD ME THAT
THEIR KITCHEN WAS IN THE BACK.

21:56.067 --> 21:58.100
SO, THE CURSING
DIDN'T BOTHER ANYBODY.

21:58.133 --> 21:59.133
THERE WAS
TOO MUCH NOISE.

21:59.167 --> 22:00.367
THE ONLY PEOPLE
WHO COULD HEAR HIM

22:00.400 --> 22:01.667
WERE THE PEOPLE WHO
WORKED IN THE KITCHEN.

22:01.700 --> 22:03.933
BUT OUR KITCHEN'S
RIGHT IN THE FRONT.

22:03.967 --> 22:04.967
HE'S GONNA
BE RIGHT THERE.

22:05.067 --> 22:06.333
HE'S GONNA BE
CURSING UP A STORM.

22:06.367 --> 22:08.333
PEOPLE COULD BE
EATING THEIR DINNER.

22:08.367 --> 22:10.200
OH MY GOD.

22:10.233 --> 22:12.467
AND, OF COURSE,
YOU COULDN'T FIRE HIM.

22:12.500 --> 22:14.467
YEAH, I'M NOT GONNA
FIRE A SURVIVOR.

22:14.500 --> 22:15.867
NO, YOU COULDN'T
DO THAT.

22:15.900 --> 22:19.700
WHOA, WOW,
LOOK AT YOU !

22:19.733 --> 22:21.933
IS IT TOO
"KNOTTS LANDING" ?

22:21.967 --> 22:26.300
I KNOW IT'S A TV SHOW BUT I
DON'T GET THE REFERENCE AT ALL.

22:26.333 --> 22:28.133
ANYWAY,
BUT YOU LIKE IT ?

22:28.167 --> 22:29.467
YEAH, IT LOOKS GREAT.

22:29.500 --> 22:30.067
IT'S NOT TOO DRESSY ?

22:30.067 --> 22:31.067
NO, I LIKE IT.

22:31.067 --> 22:35.133
UM, WELL, MAYBE
HE WON'T CURSE TONIGHT.

22:35.167 --> 22:36.433
HE CAN'T CONTROL IT.

22:36.467 --> 22:37.700
NOTHING CAN
CONTROL IT.

22:37.733 --> 22:40.567
I'VE SEEN HIM TWICE
AND HE'S CURSED BOTH TIMES.

22:40.600 --> 22:43.100
I MEAN, THE ONLY THING
I DON'T GET IS

22:43.133 --> 22:45.067
WHY HE DOESN'T
CURSE IN FRENCH.

22:45.067 --> 22:47.500
WHY IS HE CURSING
IN ENGLISH ?

22:47.533 --> 22:49.067
THAT MOTHERFUCKER,
WHERE DID HE GET THAT FROM ?

22:49.100 --> 22:50.067
I DON'T KNOW.

22:50.067 --> 22:51.667
( French accent )
COCKSUCKER.

22:51.700 --> 22:53.300
STOP IT, HE DOES
NOT SAY COCKSUCKER.

22:53.333 --> 22:54.367
HE DOES.

22:54.400 --> 22:56.067
ALL IN ENGLISH,
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

22:56.100 --> 22:58.400
AREN'T THERE OBSCENITIES IN
FRENCH THERE THAT HE COULD SAY ?

22:58.433 --> 23:01.967
LISTEN, CAN I JUST TELL YOU,
BEFORE WE EVEN GET THERE,

23:02.067 --> 23:05.933
THAT I AM NOT LOOKING FORWARD
TO RUNNING INTO SUSIE GREEN.

23:05.967 --> 23:07.567
SUSIE GREEN, YEAH.

23:07.600 --> 23:09.233
SHE HATES ME.

23:09.267 --> 23:10.733
SHE REALLY
HATES ME NOW.

23:10.767 --> 23:11.967
SHE WON'T EVEN
TALK TO ME.

23:12.067 --> 23:15.300
YOU KNOW, I MEAN,
WHAT AM I GONNA DO ?

23:15.333 --> 23:17.133
UH, I WOULDN'T
EVEN GO IF I WERE YOU.

23:17.167 --> 23:18.400
IT'S TOO AWKWARD.

23:18.433 --> 23:21.433
YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.

23:21.467 --> 23:22.900
MAYBE I'LL JUST
SIT IN THE CAR.

23:22.933 --> 23:23.733
AW, YEAH.

23:23.767 --> 23:24.767
HOW ABOUT THAT ?

23:24.800 --> 23:26.067
REALLY, THAT'S WHAT
YOU SHOULD DO.

23:26.067 --> 23:29.167
ALRIGHT, LET'S
GET OUT OF HERE.

23:29.200 --> 23:30.800
( giggling )

23:41.367 --> 23:42.967
OH, GEEZ.

23:43.067 --> 23:44.067
WHOA !

23:44.100 --> 23:45.133
WOW.

23:45.167 --> 23:46.367
WOW.

23:48.200 --> 23:49.367
LOOK AT THAT.

23:49.400 --> 23:50.500
SEE, THERE'S
A ROOM OVER THERE.

23:50.533 --> 23:51.400
YEAH, THIS IS
PRETTY BIG.

23:51.433 --> 23:52.767
YEAH.

23:52.800 --> 23:54.500
PRETTY GOOD.

23:54.533 --> 23:55.833
I AM VERY IMPRESSED.

23:55.867 --> 23:56.267
HUH ?

23:56.300 --> 23:57.733
YEAH.

23:57.767 --> 23:59.667
NOT BAD.
NOT BAD.

23:59.700 --> 24:01.900
SEE, SEE, THE BELL,
NOW, WATCH THIS.

24:01.933 --> 24:03.767
WOW.

24:03.800 --> 24:05.067

24:12.500 --> 24:14.167
HI, JEFF,

MY INVESTOR FRIENDS.

24:17.300 --> 24:18.433
WOW, HI.

24:18.467 --> 24:21.600

24:23.767 --> 24:24.533
WHAT DO YOU THINK ?

24:24.567 --> 24:26.700
I AM VERY IMPRESSED.

24:26.733 --> 24:28.100
SHE'S A LITTLE
KNOCKED OUT, I THINK.

24:28.133 --> 24:29.267
I AM.

24:29.300 --> 24:31.333
THIS IS NOT
WHAT I EXPECTED.

24:31.367 --> 24:32.733
WELL, WE COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT
WITHOUT THE BIG GUY HERE.

24:32.767 --> 24:33.900
IS THAT RIGHT ?

24:33.933 --> 24:35.067
