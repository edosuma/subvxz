00:32.015 --> 00:34.517
Gosh, go home, harold.

00:34.552 --> 00:37.020
I'm not done yet.

00:37.055 --> 00:42.025
Harold, you hear me? You should've
gone home already. I'm not done yet.

00:42.525 --> 00:46.362
For cryin' out loud.
This ain't so difficult.

00:50.283 --> 00:54.738
I'm not done yet!

00:56.740 --> 01:00.126
Harold, it's past
your bedtime.

01:00.161 --> 01:03.530
It's okay. And the doctors
will be worried about you.

01:03.565 --> 01:06.633
You did a good job today.
Now you go home. Come on.

01:08.620 --> 01:11.905
Thirty-seven, forty-five,

01:11.940 --> 01:14.491
sixty-three, seventy-one,

01:14.526 --> 01:17.494
eighty-six, ninety-two.

01:58.234 --> 02:00.737
What the hell?

02:08.745 --> 02:10.747
Geez!

02:14.601 --> 02:18.221
Oh, my god!

02:18.256 --> 02:22.142
Oh, my god!
Oh!

02:22.177 --> 02:26.012
I'll get help!
Oh!

02:46.983 --> 02:49.485
Officer! Officer!

02:49.520 --> 02:51.821
Go on, sir.
This don't involve you.

02:51.856 --> 02:55.241
There's a woman inside.
She's bleeding. She's...

03:00.079 --> 03:01.865
my god.

03:03.833 --> 03:05.518
That's her!

03:05.553 --> 03:09.088
That's the girl i saw.

04:13.586 --> 04:17.206
Hey, scully!
Take a look at this.

04:20.476 --> 04:22.478
What am i looking at?

04:22.513 --> 04:25.314
The pin setter. See the
way it's wedged and broken?

04:25.349 --> 04:27.533
Yeah.

04:27.568 --> 04:32.938
Mr. Pintero said that would only happen if
considerable weight was placed on it from above.

04:32.973 --> 04:35.891
- This is where you saw the body?
- Yes, ma'am.

04:35.926 --> 04:39.278
She was caught up in the
machinery. Her neck was cut.

04:39.778 --> 04:42.114
And the blood from the victim
was pooling where?

04:42.149 --> 04:43.649
Right here.

04:43.684 --> 04:47.786
But both the body and the blood
were gone when you returned?

04:47.821 --> 04:52.391
Yeah! But like, like i said,
the woman in the parking lot...

04:52.426 --> 04:55.077
was the same woman that you saw
caught up in the machinery?

04:55.112 --> 04:57.763
That's right.

05:12.511 --> 05:14.346
Look, i'm not
making this up.

05:14.381 --> 05:18.183
No one's suggesting that you are, mr.
Pintero. I saw the look on her face.

05:19.735 --> 05:22.004
Can i ask you a favor?
Can i get a soda?

05:22.039 --> 05:25.741
A cola? Something like that? Sure, yeah.

05:30.112 --> 05:32.114
What is that "look," scully?

05:32.149 --> 05:35.117
I would've thought that after four years,
you'd know exactly what that "look" was.

05:35.152 --> 05:37.119
You don't believe in ghosts?

05:37.154 --> 05:40.622
You're saying that what this
man saw was the victim's ghost?

05:40.657 --> 05:43.042
Sounds more like
a disembodied soul.

05:43.077 --> 05:45.544
Which is just another name
for a ghost.

05:45.579 --> 05:49.048
Except according to mr. Pintero,
this one was trying to communicate.

05:49.083 --> 05:52.051
She was speaking to him as if she
was trying to tell him something.

05:52.551 --> 05:56.055
It sounds more like a
death omen. A death omen?

05:56.090 --> 06:00.793
Yeah. It's a spirit being that
arrives as a harbinger of death.

06:09.368 --> 06:13.455
This is the third reported sighting
in as many weeks. And as many murders.

06:13.490 --> 06:16.959
Each time the victim appearing near the crime
scene trying to communicate, to say something.

06:16.994 --> 06:21.313
Communicate what? I don't
know yet, but... thank you.

06:21.348 --> 06:24.316
If you hold on a second,
i may have an answer for you.

06:30.973 --> 06:33.976
Hey! What are you doin'?

06:36.779 --> 06:39.064
"She is me."

06:39.099 --> 06:44.470
- What?
- Written onto the wax. "She is me." look at this.

06:49.658 --> 06:53.028
Three victims.
All women.

06:53.063 --> 06:57.649
All approximately the same age,
height, weight, hair and eye color.

06:57.684 --> 07:02.154
All attacked within the same
six-block area of each other.

07:02.189 --> 07:04.656
Our f.b.i.
Profiling model...

07:05.157 --> 07:08.710
suggests a white male,
late 20s, early 30s.

07:08.745 --> 07:12.364
His victims were probably
strangers to him.

07:12.865 --> 07:15.701
Symbols representing
other women in his life.

07:15.736 --> 07:19.021
Perhaps all women.

07:19.056 --> 07:23.976
- Hey, you, in the back? Are we boring you?
- No, not at all.

07:24.011 --> 07:26.879
Because if you have nothing
to contribute to this profile...

07:26.914 --> 07:30.365
i do have something to add. I think that
following the f.b.i. Model in this case,

07:30.866 --> 07:32.367
will not only fail
to turn up the killer,

07:32.868 --> 07:35.304
but will undoubtedly lead
to more victims and more deaths.

07:35.339 --> 07:38.140
You want to tell us who you
are and what you base that on?

07:39.825 --> 07:43.162
I'm special agent mulder. This is
agent scully. We're from the f.b.i.

07:43.197 --> 07:45.998
We're here following up a lead
that seems to have been dropped.

07:46.033 --> 07:48.450
A statement made by the
proprietor of the bowling alley...

07:48.485 --> 07:50.169
the guy who claims
he saw the victim.

07:50.204 --> 07:52.337
No, no, not the victim.
Her apparition.

07:52.372 --> 07:56.675
What the irish call a fetch. What
is more commonly known as a wraith.

07:56.710 --> 07:59.261
Oh! Okay.

07:59.296 --> 08:03.565
- Were there any written messages in any of these other cases?
- Written messages?

08:03.600 --> 08:08.220
Do the words, "she is me"
have any meaning to you?

08:08.255 --> 08:09.838
You mean penny timmons'
last words.

08:09.873 --> 08:11.824
Those were her dying words?

08:12.324 --> 08:15.627
According to a 911 call we
received... who made that call?

08:15.662 --> 08:17.846
- A nut.
- What do you mean?

08:18.347 --> 08:22.835
There were no dying words. Penny
timmons' larynx was severed.

08:22.870 --> 08:26.088
She couldn't cry for help even
if there was help to cry for.

08:26.123 --> 08:30.025
And no one followed up on this lead? No.

08:30.060 --> 08:35.097
- I'll have someone get you the number and you can follow up.
- I'd appreciate that.

08:37.883 --> 08:39.885
People? People?

08:39.919 --> 08:43.621
Listen up now. I brought some
folks who want to talk with you.

08:43.657 --> 08:46.491
Nurse innes,
could you gather the group?

08:46.526 --> 08:49.211
All right, everyone, let's go.
You know the drill.

08:49.246 --> 08:53.966
Get your seats.
Group seating. Go on in.

08:55.300 --> 09:00.205
Harold? Come on.
Harold.

09:05.994 --> 09:10.232
- Good morning, everybody.
- Good morning, mr. Alpert.

09:10.267 --> 09:13.936
I brought visitors today.
They're investigating a crime.

09:15.871 --> 09:20.259
It's okay. They just want
to ask you a few questions.

09:20.294 --> 09:23.078
Hi. I wanted to ask...

09:23.113 --> 09:27.082
if anybody used the pay phone
in the hallway on friday night?

09:27.117 --> 09:29.451
Because somebody called the
police and reported a murder.

09:32.704 --> 09:35.257
Sloppy joe night.

09:36.541 --> 09:38.794
That was sloppy joe night.

09:38.829 --> 09:41.413
Ooh! That was me.
I did it.

09:41.448 --> 09:46.285
I admit it. I did it. I'm
just a human being after all.

09:46.320 --> 09:48.870
Chuck, tell the truth.

09:52.174 --> 09:55.177
Nah. I'm sorry.

09:55.212 --> 09:57.012
I didn't mean it.

09:57.047 --> 10:02.517
I lied. I lied, but
i'm just a human being.

10:02.552 --> 10:07.205
Has anyone
used the pay phone...

10:07.240 --> 10:10.442
to call the police?

10:12.477 --> 10:14.479
Anybody recognize this woman?

10:23.338 --> 10:26.041
That's the lady
that got murdered.

10:26.076 --> 10:28.193
Yeah, she's the one.
i recognize her.

10:28.228 --> 10:32.163
I know her.
She was murdered.

10:32.198 --> 10:35.817
And does anybody recognize
this man?

10:35.852 --> 10:39.070
- Oh, yes. Yes, he did it.
- He did it.

10:39.105 --> 10:43.308
- He's the murderer. - He's a
very funny man. - He smiles a lot.

10:43.343 --> 10:45.710
Uh...

10:47.545 --> 10:49.464
The quiet man in the back.
Harold spuller.

10:49.964 --> 10:51.716
The only one who didn't
raise his hand. Yeah.

10:51.751 --> 10:53.968
Has he ever been a problem? Harold?

10:54.003 --> 10:57.722
No! He has a tendency
to get a little worked up.

10:57.757 --> 11:00.108
Do you think i can talk to him? Yeah, sure.

11:00.143 --> 11:01.609
All right.

11:18.843 --> 11:20.712
I think i found
something here, mulder.

11:20.747 --> 11:25.366
In these photos taken
by the forensics team,

11:25.401 --> 11:29.370
the third victim, her left hand,
that band of pale skin?

11:29.405 --> 11:31.773
It looks like she wore a ring on
that hand. A wedding ring, yeah.

11:31.808 --> 11:34.526
Yeah, but
she wasn't married.

11:34.561 --> 11:37.629
So what, he stole her ring? No, not at all.

11:37.664 --> 11:39.848
He switched it.

11:39.883 --> 11:43.284
And in all the other murders,
he repeated the same ritual.

11:43.319 --> 11:45.503
Changing the ring
on each of the victims.

11:45.538 --> 11:48.306
Nice catch, scully.

11:48.807 --> 11:51.810
Any idea about
the psychology at work?

11:51.845 --> 11:55.113
There's something called ego dystonia,
a form of obsessive compulsive disorder,

11:55.148 --> 11:58.833
where a person has the persistence
and inescapable impulses...

11:58.868 --> 12:01.336
to change things,
to organize, to reorganize.

12:01.371 --> 12:04.572
But it's not ordinarily something
that escalates to a murderous impulse.

12:04.607 --> 12:08.526
Not ordinarily, unless there was
a more complex psychology at work...

12:08.561 --> 12:11.029
like pronounced
mental illness.

12:11.064 --> 12:14.349
You really think that the killer is a
patient here? I'm not sure the killer is here.

12:14.849 --> 12:18.636
But the person that made that phone call
is. I think his name is harold spuller.

12:18.671 --> 12:22.140
Did he cop to making the
call? No. He's about to.

12:27.328 --> 12:31.699
I don't know anything.

12:31.734 --> 12:35.587
I didn't do anything.
Leave me alone.

12:35.622 --> 12:37.922
You made that phone call,
didn't you, harold?

12:37.957 --> 12:40.358
No.

12:40.393 --> 12:43.144
Did you say the words,
"she is me"?

12:43.179 --> 12:45.797
No.

12:45.832 --> 12:48.099
Have you ever heard
those words?

12:49.450 --> 12:50.752
No!

12:53.121 --> 12:55.790
Have you ever seen a ghost,
harold?

12:59.144 --> 13:01.779
No. No.

13:01.814 --> 13:05.083
No! No! No! No!

13:05.118 --> 13:08.987
No! No! No! No!
No, no, no, no, no!

13:09.022 --> 13:13.992
Harold, down. No, no, no,
no, please leave me alone.

13:14.027 --> 13:17.295
Don't, harold. Leave me
alone! No, no, no, no!

13:17.330 --> 13:19.464
No, no, no, no, no!
Harold, listen to me.

13:19.499 --> 13:24.552
When you're right,
you're right.

13:24.587 --> 13:30.175
Seventeen, thirty, thirty-seven,
forty-five, fifty-three.

13:36.064 --> 13:39.567
Harold spuller suffers from
pervasive developmental disorder...

13:39.602 --> 13:41.569
where they're sometimes
called atypical autism.

13:41.604 --> 13:46.074
He has spent his entire life in and
out of facilities just like this one.

13:46.574 --> 13:49.327
He has been medicated, he
has received shock therapy,

13:49.362 --> 13:51.312
and aside from
his other disabilities,

13:51.347 --> 13:55.300
he has been diagnosed with severe ego
dystonic obsessive compulsive disorder,

13:55.800 --> 13:58.503
which would explain the
switching of the victims' rings.

13:58.538 --> 14:02.156
So why all of a sudden?
You mean what made him snap?

14:02.191 --> 14:05.643
I think his outburst clearly showed a
frustrated impulse towards violence...

14:05.678 --> 14:07.645
when he was put in
a challenging situation.

14:08.146 --> 14:11.149
That outburst didn't come until after
i'd asked him if he'd ever seen a ghost.

14:11.184 --> 14:13.134
Mulder,
the man is disturbed.

14:13.635 --> 14:17.438
You could see the pressure building in
him from the moment the interview began.

14:17.473 --> 14:19.190
Yeah.

14:19.225 --> 14:22.610
Why are you now so unconvinced that harold
spuller is the man we came looking for?

14:22.645 --> 14:24.963
I'm sure harold spuller's the
man that made that phone call.

14:24.998 --> 14:28.466
But what led us to him,
it still remains unexplained.

14:28.501 --> 14:31.002
- "She is me"? - Mm-hmm.
And the other apparitions.

14:31.502 --> 14:33.388
Like the one mr. Pintero saw
at the bowling alley.

14:33.423 --> 14:36.524
I think i have an idea about
that, if not an explanation.

14:36.559 --> 14:39.327
Harold spuller is at
this facility voluntarily,

14:39.362 --> 14:41.329
which means he can come
and go as he pleases.

14:41.364 --> 14:46.584
To kill those women, or
to hold down a job or both.

14:48.002 --> 14:50.471
Oh, scully.

14:50.506 --> 14:53.474
Yeah, it's okay.
You sure?

14:53.509 --> 14:55.476
Yeah, it's just...
i'm fine.

14:55.511 --> 14:57.979
I just need to find
a washroom.

15:49.797 --> 15:52.166
Scully?

15:54.118 --> 15:57.622
Scully, you in there?

16:02.994 --> 16:05.480
Yeah.

16:06.981 --> 16:11.102
They found another victim. A
college student with her throat cut,

16:11.137 --> 16:14.472
just about half a block
from here.

16:37.613 --> 16:40.115
Her name was lauren heller,
age 21. she was single.

16:40.616 --> 16:44.620
Apparently she was on her way home from
a bar that she part-timed at after school.

16:44.655 --> 16:47.122
She had a ring on her left hand.
It was switched to her right hand.

16:47.157 --> 16:49.608
The pinkie finger.

16:49.858 --> 16:53.529
She was dead less than
an hour when she was found.

16:55.164 --> 16:57.499
That would rule out harold
spuller as the killer.

16:57.534 --> 16:59.701
No, actually it doesn't.
Harold's not at the home.

16:59.736 --> 17:02.755
He's nowhere to be found. His nurse
locked him in his room after we left,

17:02.790 --> 17:05.156
but he managed
to escape unnoticed.

17:09.128 --> 17:11.597
I don't imagine
he'd be too hard to find.

17:11.632 --> 17:13.232
Yeah, but we should be
the ones to find him.

17:13.732 --> 17:16.852
If only to find out
what "she is me" means.

17:16.887 --> 17:19.771
Mulder...

17:19.807 --> 17:22.273
What?

17:22.309 --> 17:24.777
I think i'm gonna let you
take care of that.

17:24.811 --> 17:28.730
I, uh, i think i'm gonna
get this checked out.

17:28.765 --> 17:30.482
Just, you know,
just to be safe.

17:30.517 --> 17:34.186
You want me to drive you?
No, no, no. I'm fine, really.

17:34.221 --> 17:38.690
I've had the doctors keep a close
watch, and this is just a precaution.

17:38.725 --> 17:42.294
You're sure?
I'm fine.

17:42.329 --> 17:44.596
Bye.

17:50.102 --> 17:54.540
Nine, seventeen,
twenty-six, thirty-two...

18:37.149 --> 18:43.522
No.

18:46.675 --> 18:49.895
I just want
to be left alone.

19:44.666 --> 19:47.002
We've spoken about your fear.

19:47.037 --> 19:52.157
You've been afraid to express
it to others. To agent mulder.

19:52.192 --> 19:55.227
- This is different.
- How?

19:57.729 --> 20:02.734
Several months ago, i was
diagnosed with a cancerous mass.

20:02.769 --> 20:05.737
A nasal pharyngeal tumor
that cannot be operated on,

20:06.238 --> 20:10.292
and cannot be treated
by conventional medicine.

20:10.327 --> 20:12.044
I'm sorry.

20:12.079 --> 20:15.797
I don't mean for this
to sound too dire.

20:15.832 --> 20:21.803
My health has been good. I have
been checked up on a weekly basis.

20:21.838 --> 20:23.754
You've kept working?

20:23.789 --> 20:26.640
Yes.

20:26.675 --> 20:29.142
It's been important to me.

20:29.177 --> 20:31.144
Why?

20:34.648 --> 20:36.950
Why? Um...

20:40.921 --> 20:44.925
agent mulder
has been concerned.

20:46.927 --> 20:50.430
He's been supportive
through this time.

20:50.465 --> 20:54.534
Do you feel that you owe it
to him to continue working?

20:54.569 --> 20:56.903
No.

20:59.106 --> 21:03.894
I guess i never realized...

21:03.929 --> 21:07.397
how much i rely on him
before this.

21:10.901 --> 21:13.403
His passion.

21:17.908 --> 21:21.211
He's been a great source of
strength that i've drawn on.

21:23.563 --> 21:26.683
What happened last night,
dana?

21:32.189 --> 21:34.691
I saw something.

21:37.194 --> 21:42.199
And i don't know
what to trust.

21:42.234 --> 21:44.201
If i saw it because
of the stress?

21:44.236 --> 21:49.706
Because the image
had been suggested to me?

21:49.741 --> 21:52.542
Or if it was a suggestion
of my own fears?

21:52.577 --> 21:55.712
Your fear of failing him?

22:01.535 --> 22:03.537
Maybe.

22:05.038 --> 22:07.541
What did you see?

22:09.042 --> 22:13.046
I saw a woman who
had recently been murdered.

22:15.048 --> 22:18.552
But i saw her.

22:21.054 --> 22:23.940
It appeared as if she was
trying to tell me something.

22:23.975 --> 22:28.311
Do you know what?
No.

22:31.615 --> 22:33.717
Are you sure?

22:46.947 --> 22:51.118
Hey, you're back. Yeah. I'm
looking for harold spuller.

22:51.153 --> 22:53.403
Harold?
What for?

22:53.438 --> 22:57.841
Suspicion of murder. You think
harold killed those women?

22:57.876 --> 22:59.876
You obviously don't think so,
huh?

22:59.911 --> 23:02.729
Harold's worked for me
for ten years.

23:02.764 --> 23:05.732
He might be crazy,
but he couldn't kill anyone.

23:05.767 --> 23:08.168
He's a sweet kid. Yeah.
You know where he is now?

23:08.203 --> 23:12.989
He was here this morning when i arrived,
arranging the shoes. He has a key?

23:13.024 --> 23:16.593
No, he's got some damn way of gettin' in
through an abandoned building next door.

23:21.531 --> 23:23.950
Did you ever get
lane six working?

23:23.985 --> 23:27.170
No. Not since
i saw the girl.

23:39.566 --> 23:41.384
Harold?

23:59.286 --> 24:00.954
Harold?

24:04.841 --> 24:08.812
Harold, i just want
to talk to you.

24:11.865 --> 24:13.867
Harold?

24:14.367 --> 24:19.372
She is me. She is me.
She is me. She is me.

24:24.129 --> 24:26.596
She is me. She is me.

24:26.631 --> 24:28.665
Harold?

24:28.700 --> 24:31.334
She is me. She is me.
She is me.

24:31.369 --> 24:35.121
She is me. She is me.
She is me. She is me.

24:39.376 --> 24:42.328
Eight, seventeen,
thirty, thirty-seven.

24:42.363 --> 24:44.330
I wanna make this clear
from the start.

24:44.365 --> 24:48.051
My client is suffering from a mental
disorder which impairs his judgment.

24:48.086 --> 24:51.454
He will not answer any questions
regarding his guilt or innocence.

24:51.489 --> 24:54.057
I'd be real happy if
he'd quit talking right now.

24:54.092 --> 24:58.445
Anytime harold becomes upset
or unwilling to cooperate,

24:58.480 --> 25:01.698
this interrogation
will end.

25:01.733 --> 25:02.949
Detective hudak?

25:02.984 --> 25:05.635
Tell me why you did it,
harold, huh? Come on.

25:05.670 --> 25:07.237
Tell me why
you killed those women.

25:07.272 --> 25:11.808
What did i just say?
This is totally unacceptable.

25:11.843 --> 25:15.028
I am prepared to tell my client
not to cooperate.

25:15.063 --> 25:18.314
Harold, you knew those women
who were murdered, didn't you?

25:21.119 --> 25:24.621
That's why you're scared.

25:24.656 --> 25:27.373
You're afraid they've
come back to visit you.

25:30.960 --> 25:33.129
Penny timmons.

25:33.164 --> 25:35.932
Eight, seventeen, thirty,

25:35.967 --> 25:39.436
thirty-seven, forty-five,
fifty-three, seventy-one,

25:39.471 --> 25:43.273
eighty, ninety-two, ninety-nine,
one-oh-eight. Mrs. Schipiro.

25:43.308 --> 25:45.158
Fourteen, twenty-nine,

25:45.193 --> 25:50.029
thirty-eight, fifty-seven,
seventy-one, seventy-nine, eighty-eight,

25:50.064 --> 25:52.348
one hundred and one,
one hundred and seventeen.

25:52.383 --> 25:54.567
Michelle chamberlain.

25:54.602 --> 25:56.619
Seventeen, thirty-two,

25:56.654 --> 25:59.823
forty-nine, sixty-nine,
seventy-eight,

25:59.858 --> 26:01.458
eighty-seven, ninety-nine.

26:01.493 --> 26:04.561
What was her shoe size?

26:04.596 --> 26:07.330
- Six-and-a-half.
- There you have it.

26:07.365 --> 26:09.999
- This is not a confession.
- He killed them.

26:10.034 --> 26:13.002
- Harold, listen. I'm advising you not to respond...
- he stalked them, fixated...

26:13.037 --> 26:18.408
nor to cooperate with
this investigation any further!

26:18.443 --> 26:21.911
Harold, there are people that think
you murdered these women. I'm not one.

26:21.946 --> 26:23.780
But i need your help
for me to prove that.

26:26.049 --> 26:27.917
You think you can do that?

26:30.236 --> 26:33.022
I think you can.

26:37.277 --> 26:40.363
Mr. Pintero, i'd like to search
the building for any ways in or out,

26:40.398 --> 26:43.366
that harold might have of
the bowling alley. Sure.

26:43.401 --> 26:45.368
Thanks.

26:46.870 --> 26:48.872
You okay, harold?

26:48.907 --> 26:52.375
The shoes are out of order,
mr. Pintero. I'm sorry.

26:52.876 --> 26:56.880
Hey, it's okay, buddy.
Don't you worry about it.

26:56.915 --> 27:00.383
You get this straightened out with these
folks, then come back and keep me in line.

27:00.884 --> 27:03.386
Okay, mr. Pintero.

27:10.628 --> 27:13.596
I wanna know why the hell we're
being led around like this?

27:13.631 --> 27:17.600
I'm hoping it will become clear to
us when we find it. Is that right?

27:18.101 --> 27:22.972
He's gonna show us something that's
gonna exonerate him? I think so.

27:27.894 --> 27:29.896
Here.

27:29.931 --> 27:32.699
Here what?

27:36.986 --> 27:42.308
My god, they're all here.
Every victim.

27:42.343 --> 27:45.144
This proves nothing.
- He fixated on them.

27:45.179 --> 27:48.114
I see hundreds of scorecards
up here.

27:48.149 --> 27:50.266
Thousands of names.
Choose a name.

27:51.651 --> 27:53.920
Pick a name.
Pick any name up there.

27:56.239 --> 27:58.124
Fred graham.

27:58.159 --> 28:01.578
Seventeen, forty-two,
sixty-seven, eighty-eight,

28:01.613 --> 28:04.230
one hundred and seven,
one hundred and twenty-two,

28:04.265 --> 28:06.966
one hundred and thirty-one,
one hundred and sixty-six,

28:07.001 --> 28:11.471
- one hundred and seventy-eight, two
hundred and one. - Two hundred game. Not bad.

28:11.938 --> 28:13.855
You're saying he has all
these scores in his head?

28:13.890 --> 28:16.141
Including the victims.

28:17.359 --> 28:21.629
You said this proves
his innocence. How?

28:21.664 --> 28:24.649
I'm not sure exactly,
but i think that... no!

28:25.467 --> 28:27.002
No!

28:32.674 --> 28:36.127
No, no, no!

28:38.063 --> 28:42.083
Breathe!

28:42.118 --> 28:45.587
One, two, three,
four, five. Breathe.

28:46.087 --> 28:49.874
He just keeled. Fell right
over. I've done all i can.

28:55.947 --> 28:57.699
Must've been a heart attack.

29:26.561 --> 29:29.130
Hey, scully.
Is it too late?

29:29.165 --> 29:30.965
No. What are you doing,
mulder?

29:31.000 --> 29:35.320
I need your help on something. I
needed your medical expertise. On what?

29:35.355 --> 29:38.223
Harold spuller. Oh!

29:38.258 --> 29:41.509
I'm sorry. I didn't even ask
you. What did your doctor say?

29:41.544 --> 29:44.379
I'm fine.
Good.

29:44.414 --> 29:46.297
What's up, mulder?

29:46.332 --> 29:49.801
Angie pintero, the bowling
alley guy? He's dead.

29:49.836 --> 29:55.173
How? Natural causes. Congestive
heart failure. Just keeled over.

29:55.208 --> 29:57.842
That's what you need my
medical opinion on? No.

29:57.877 --> 30:01.613
Harold spuller had a premonitory
vision of his boss's death.

30:01.648 --> 30:04.399
I don't understand.
Harold saw an apparition.

30:04.434 --> 30:06.751
What may have been angie
pintero's disembodied soul...

30:07.252 --> 30:09.254
at the moment of
or just prior to his death.

30:09.289 --> 30:12.123
How do you know? Because i was
standing right there when he saw it.

30:12.158 --> 30:14.742
But you didn't see it yourself? No.

30:14.777 --> 30:16.611
Why?

30:16.646 --> 30:18.546
I don't have that facility.

30:19.047 --> 30:21.883
That kind of connection to the victims
that would have made such a vision possible.

30:21.918 --> 30:24.219
What's harold spuller's
connection?

30:24.254 --> 30:26.971
I don't know its exact nature, but i think
it has something to do with his autism.

30:27.006 --> 30:30.692
That harold experienced a profound
attachment to these victims,

30:30.727 --> 30:32.727
but because of his disability,
was unable to express...

30:32.762 --> 30:34.729
the depth and power
of those relationships.

30:35.230 --> 30:39.801
So somehow a psychic or preconscious bond
was formed that went beyond the temporal.

30:40.301 --> 30:42.303
Whoa, wait a minute. So harold
knew the people that were killed?

30:42.338 --> 30:45.023
Yeah, from the bowling alley.
Going back seven years.

30:45.058 --> 30:47.158
Even if what you're saying
is true,

30:47.193 --> 30:49.661
harold wasn't the only one who
claims to have seen these apparitions.

30:49.696 --> 30:53.314
No. But he does have something in common
with those who've had the visions...

30:53.349 --> 30:55.150
that is quite powerful
in its own right.

30:55.185 --> 30:57.902
Which is what?
They were all dying.

30:57.937 --> 31:03.274
Um, one of emphysema, one of
cancer and, uh, now angie pintero.

31:03.309 --> 31:05.527
Harold spuller's dying too?

31:05.562 --> 31:09.330
Well, that's what i need
your medical opinion on.

31:09.365 --> 31:13.902
- Well, what if he isn't?
- I would be very surprised.

31:13.937 --> 31:17.105
What is a death omen if not
a vision of our own mortality?

31:17.140 --> 31:20.425
And who among us would most
likely be able to see the dead?

31:22.844 --> 31:26.564
Harold's at the resident home
right now.

31:26.599 --> 31:29.150
I'll meet you there.

31:54.459 --> 31:56.461
Harold?

32:11.976 --> 32:15.980
Agent mulder will be sending
a doctor to examine you.

32:18.483 --> 32:21.819
well, you're back. It's gonna
be all right now, harold.

32:21.854 --> 32:25.790
They just want us to keep you
here for a little checkup.

32:25.825 --> 32:29.294
There's nothing to worry about.
Thanks, officers.

32:34.632 --> 32:37.569
All right, chuck.

32:37.604 --> 32:41.356
Go to bed. You can see
harold in the morning.

32:48.029 --> 32:52.467
See? Everyone's so glad
to see you back, harold.

32:52.967 --> 32:54.852
You'll be able to talk
to chuck in the morning.

32:54.887 --> 32:57.906
You still have to take
your meds though, harold.

32:58.356 --> 33:00.158
Keeps you flyin'
straight and level.

33:00.193 --> 33:04.996
Eighty, eighty-eight,
ninety-two, ninety-nine.

33:05.031 --> 33:08.499
Come on. It's the way
we always do it.

33:08.534 --> 33:12.020
Seventy-eight, eighty-seven.

33:12.055 --> 33:14.839
Attaboy.
Good stuff.

33:14.874 --> 33:17.058
Hi.
Lucas brought him back.

33:17.093 --> 33:20.161
Is he acting up?
- No!

33:20.196 --> 33:22.013
I think he's just
a little scared.

33:22.513 --> 33:24.766
I've been tryin' to get him
to take his meds.

33:24.801 --> 33:27.852
Fourteen, twenty-nine,
thirty-seven.

33:27.887 --> 33:32.640
Why don't you let me sit with
him for a bit? Okay, sure.

33:42.850 --> 33:44.352
Take your poison, harold.

33:44.387 --> 33:46.988
Go on.

33:49.324 --> 33:53.628
What've you got
to live for now, huh?

33:54.946 --> 33:56.948
What did you tell them,
harold?

33:56.983 --> 34:00.685
Fifty-nine. Did you tell them
about your little girlfriends?

34:02.637 --> 34:04.639
Huh?

34:04.674 --> 34:07.925
Did you tell them how you were in love? No!

34:07.960 --> 34:09.944
Did you show them
your pictures?

34:09.978 --> 34:11.813
No.

34:15.065 --> 34:18.052
What do you think those
girls thought of you, harold?

34:20.021 --> 34:22.023
Do you think
they loved you back?

34:24.243 --> 34:27.411
No one could love you,
harold.

34:27.447 --> 34:29.246
Look at yourself.

34:29.282 --> 34:34.502
They looked at you
and saw an ugly toad, a retard.

34:42.560 --> 34:44.429
Agent mulder. Thanks for
accommodating us again.

34:44.464 --> 34:48.399
Not a problem. We're all
concerned for harold. I understand.

34:48.434 --> 34:50.935
You're bringing a doctor?
Agent scully's a doctor.

34:50.969 --> 34:54.806
If you could arrange to have harold's
medical records made available...

35:05.450 --> 35:08.469
Oh!
What's happened to you?

35:08.504 --> 35:11.055
Oh!
Don't touch that.

35:11.090 --> 35:13.708
Don't touch that.
It's just a cut.

35:28.890 --> 35:32.160
He just went wacko.

35:32.195 --> 35:34.996
I was tryin' to get him to take
his meds and he went berserk.

35:35.031 --> 35:38.216
He jumps me, he starts pounding
me like he wants to kill me.

35:38.251 --> 35:40.435
Did he say anything?

35:40.935 --> 35:44.439
No, he just started screaming
like a lunatic.

35:44.939 --> 35:48.409
Something's gone wrong with him.
I think he's lost it for good.

35:48.444 --> 35:52.146
I'll be damned if i'm gonna
take care of him anymore.

35:52.181 --> 35:55.450
I think you should get this
cut on your head looked at.

35:55.485 --> 35:59.070
Maybe just give me a few minutes
to get my nerves back.

36:02.957 --> 36:05.960
Okay, everybody,
everything's fine now.

36:05.995 --> 36:08.880
Come on, back to bed. That's
right, dear. Go on now.

36:09.380 --> 36:12.884
We'll see you in the morning.
Night-night, everybody.

36:14.385 --> 36:18.022
What can i do to help? Call the
police. Ask for detective hudak.

36:18.523 --> 36:21.242
Tell him what happened. Tell him to look
for harold down at the bowling alley.

36:21.277 --> 36:24.612
Are they gonna arrest him? I don't
see that there's any way around that.

36:24.647 --> 36:26.597
I'm sorry.

36:30.334 --> 36:34.138
Maybe you were wrong. Well, that's
a superficial head wound, scully.

36:34.173 --> 36:36.541
He didn't mean to kill her
or maim her.

36:37.041 --> 36:38.509
That's not the work
of a murderer if you ask me.

36:39.010 --> 36:42.563
Then why would he do it? Maybe harold
is sicker than we thought he was.

36:42.598 --> 36:45.933
Maybe. We won't know
until we can examine him.

36:47.735 --> 36:49.871
I think there's someone
you can talk to about it.

36:49.906 --> 36:54.158
Why don't you talk to his roommate, and
i'll see what i can do about finding harold.

37:14.979 --> 37:16.981
Oh, hi.

37:17.016 --> 37:20.485
Is your name chuck?
Yes. Yes, it is.

37:20.520 --> 37:24.989
Chuck forsch.
F-o-r-s-c-h.

37:25.024 --> 37:27.492
Chuck forsch.

37:27.527 --> 37:32.997
Do you share this room with
harold? Yes, he's my friend.

37:35.233 --> 37:36.984
Do you know
where he is?

37:37.019 --> 37:39.203
He's dying, isn't he?

37:39.238 --> 37:43.474
Harold is dying.
Why do you say that?

37:43.509 --> 37:47.628
Nurse innes. She's, she's
trying to poison him.

37:47.663 --> 37:50.798
Who told you that?
Harold.

37:51.299 --> 37:54.802
He said she told him she was
putting poison in his meds.

37:54.837 --> 37:58.507
Harold hasn't been taking
his medication? I don't know.

37:58.542 --> 38:02.944
I don't know everything.
I'm only a human being.

38:02.979 --> 38:06.731
But i do know that...
that harold's my friend.

38:06.766 --> 38:09.434
He wouldn't hurt anybody.

38:09.469 --> 38:14.906
You know, he really loved them.

38:14.941 --> 38:17.142
Who?

38:29.921 --> 38:34.426
Harold,
he gave them to me.

38:34.461 --> 38:36.928
He was afraid.

38:40.949 --> 38:43.501
Does anybody else know
about these pictures, chuck?

38:44.769 --> 38:46.104
Nurse innes.

38:58.266 --> 39:00.135
How are you feeling?

39:00.170 --> 39:02.537
I'm, you know, shaky.

39:02.572 --> 39:05.006
Understandable.

39:05.041 --> 39:08.543
Working with these people, it
starts driving you crazy too.

39:08.578 --> 39:11.463
I'm just looking
forward to going home.

39:11.963 --> 39:14.699
- Will your family be a comfort?
- I live alone.

39:14.734 --> 39:17.018
No children?

39:17.053 --> 39:19.471
Just the one my husband
ran off with.

39:24.276 --> 39:28.463
Nurse innes, i'm afraid i'm going to have
to ask you to step out into the hallway.

39:46.481 --> 39:48.533
Stay where you are!

39:49.701 --> 39:51.886
Drop it!

39:51.921 --> 39:54.689
Let it go!

40:09.070 --> 40:11.656
She's alive. Let's get a paramedic in here.

40:11.691 --> 40:13.358
Yeah.

40:13.393 --> 40:16.378
You're cut.
Yeah, she attacked me.

40:23.051 --> 40:25.770
You might wanna bag that. I'm
pretty sure it's the murder weapon.

40:30.358 --> 40:34.863
She had been taking harold's
meds... clonazepam and clozapine...

40:34.898 --> 40:38.700
the unregulated effects of which are
violence and unpredictable behavior.

40:38.735 --> 40:40.702
Yeah, but why did you
even suspect her?

40:40.737 --> 40:42.704
I went in to talk
to harold's roommate,

40:43.204 --> 40:44.906
and he said that harold thought
she had been poisoning him.

40:45.407 --> 40:48.910
So i went in to confront her
and she just went off.

40:48.945 --> 40:51.413
Why do you think she killed
those women? I don't know.

40:51.448 --> 40:54.916
I mean, maybe in some drug-addled
way, she was trying to kill happiness.

40:55.417 --> 40:58.420
Harold's happiness.
His love for those women.

40:58.455 --> 41:02.424
Maybe trying to destroy something
she thought she'd never have again.

41:02.924 --> 41:05.427
"She is me."
I don't know.

41:05.462 --> 41:07.679
Have they found harold?
Yeah.

41:07.714 --> 41:10.782
They found him in an alley a few blocks
from here, face down on the pavement.

41:10.817 --> 41:13.718
They worked on him for 20 minutes,
but he couldn't be revived.

41:13.753 --> 41:18.156
What happened? Well, preliminary
diagnosis is apnea: Respiratory failure.

41:18.191 --> 41:21.359
As a result of what? The paramedics
are at a loss to explain that.

41:21.394 --> 41:23.962
But if what you're saying is true, that
harold stopped taking his medication,

41:24.462 --> 41:26.464
then that could have been
a factor in his death.

41:26.499 --> 41:29.951
At least in the visions that he was
seeing. Harold spuller wasn't dying.

41:30.452 --> 41:33.338
He was killed as a result of what
that woman took away from him.

41:33.373 --> 41:37.025
Is that your
medical opinion?

41:37.060 --> 41:40.362
- I saw something, mulder.
- What?

41:42.330 --> 41:44.332
The fourth victim.

41:44.367 --> 41:47.335
I saw her in the bathroom
before you came to tell me.

41:47.370 --> 41:49.537
Why didn't you tell me?

41:49.572 --> 41:51.906
Because i didn't want
to believe it.

41:51.941 --> 41:54.242
Because i don't
want to believe it.

41:54.277 --> 41:58.413
Is that why you came down here?
To prove that it wasn't true?

41:58.448 --> 42:01.015
No. I came down here
because you asked me to.

42:01.050 --> 42:03.351
Why can't you be honest
with me?

42:03.386 --> 42:06.354
What do you want me to say?
That you're right?

42:06.389 --> 42:09.107
That i believe it, even if i
don't? Is that what you want?

42:09.142 --> 42:14.379
- Is that what you think i want to hear?
- No.

42:14.414 --> 42:18.800
You can believe what you want to believe,
but you can't hide the truth from me.

42:19.300 --> 42:21.302
Because if you do,
then you're working against me.

42:21.337 --> 42:23.188
And yourself.

42:25.073 --> 42:29.527
I know what
you're afraid of.

42:29.562 --> 42:31.329
I'm afraid
of the same thing.

42:33.748 --> 42:36.251
The doctor said i was fine.

42:38.236 --> 42:40.238
I hope that's the truth.

42:42.674 --> 42:44.676
I'm going home.

44:32.566 --> 44:35.369
I made this.
