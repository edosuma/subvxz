He usually takes care of me.

00:13.580 --> 00:16.481
Oh, no, I'm afraid Dennis quit.
He quit?

00:16.549 --> 00:20.610
Yeah, apparently he had one
regular customer that was
driving him crazy.

00:20.687 --> 00:23.622

00:26.993 --> 00:31.760
Dennis quit.
Yes, we are looking for another
shirt just like this.

00:31.831 --> 00:34.197
Y-You want the same shirt?
Identical, yeah.

00:34.267 --> 00:37.828
Same color, same pattern.
16-inch neck, 33-inch sleeve.

00:37.904 --> 00:42.068
Okay, but you already have one

No, yeah, this, uh, this was

I'm not a big fan of Number 6.
Do you have any that are
inspected by Number 8?

Okay, um, the customer's
always right.

Look at this.

01:30.123 --> 01:32.523
Look, she's an artist.

01:32.592 --> 01:35.186
Oh, I've been admiring
her work for years.

01:35.261 --> 01:38.992

There's a tear, right there.
[Sighs] And look at this.

This sleeve is all wrong.
It's completely crooked.

01:50.276 --> 01:54.007
Well, maybe she had a bad day.
No, that's not possible.

Mrs. Hammond, I need
to hear this again, please.

04:01.874 --> 04:05.207
Now, you came home and you
found your husband on the floor
about an hour ago.

04:05.278 --> 04:07.269
Yes.
And he'd been stabbed.

04:07.347 --> 04:09.406
- Yes.
- It's not funny.

04:09.482 --> 04:11.450
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's not funny.

04:11.517 --> 04:15.112
Inspector Number 8 was very
important to me because no
matter how bad things got,

04:15.188 --> 04:17.349
I knew I could
always count on her.

04:17.423 --> 04:20.392
Mr. Monk, you understand
you're talking about someone
you have never even met...

04:20.459 --> 04:23.327
who works in a factory somewhere
who inspects shirts!

04:23.396 --> 04:26.331
She's my soul mate.
You don't even know
if it's a man or a woman.

04:26.399 --> 04:29.527
I love her.
I think she's in trouble.

04:29.602 --> 04:32.400
Okay, maybe she's retired.
Maybe there's a new Number 8.

04:32.472 --> 04:34.463
No, it's not possible.

04:34.540 --> 04:36.667
She would never retire.
She loves her work.

04:36.743 --> 04:38.677
Look at this shirt.
Now, Inspector Number 5,

04:38.745 --> 04:41.737

because he stopped caring years ago.

04:41.814 --> 04:43.805

Oh, yeah. I'm sorry.

something else.

- No. Monk met the killer's mother.

- She's a shirt inspector.
- She swears he's innocent.

Captain, what do you

26:23.515 --> 26:25.949
It means that your boss scared
somebody.

26:53.411 --> 26:55.402

Too beautiful.

26:55.480 --> 26:58.210
Sometimes I wish she had a big
old fat hairy wart right here.

26:58.283 --> 27:00.717
Or maybe- maybe here.

27:00.785 --> 27:03.618
Everyone, um, could you just come
around here for a moment please?

27:03.688 --> 27:06.213
Thank you. Yes, put that down.
That's okay. Do that later.

27:06.291 --> 27:10.284
Thank you. I just want to say
a few quick words.

27:12.964 --> 27:14.989
This has been a terrible day
for us today.

<i>except, of course,</i>
<i>when she was driving us nuts.</i>
<i>[Laughs]</i>

27:31.282 --> 27:33.876
But I can feel her here.

27:33.952 --> 27:37.547
<i>L- l-I can feel her spirit,</i>
<i>her soul.</i>

27:37.622 --> 27:43.390
Can you feel that? And I know
she's going to be with us
tomorrow night at the show.

27:43.461 --> 27:47.795
So let's not let her down.
Huh?

What?

29:00.205 --> 29:03.834
Have you forgot that when it
comes to my art, I'm a total monster?

29:03.908 --> 29:06.570
I mean, just look at yourself.
Look. You're a mess.

29:06.644 --> 29:09.841
I mean, look here.
Look at this. Look at the collar.

29:09.914 --> 29:13.475
Look, it's all twisted.
And-And-And all these wrinkles
on the dress.

29:13.551 --> 29:17.282
<i>I mean, look, sweetheart.</i>
Natalie, do you have
the case file?

29:17.355 --> 29:19.823
What?
The case file. Give it to me.

<i>I'd rather put you in a burlap</i>

29:26.865 --> 29:29.993
Her body is all contorted.

29:30.068 --> 29:33.765
But the collar and her buttons
are perfectly straight.

29:33.838 --> 29:36.830
After he killed her,
he straightened them out.

29:36.908 --> 29:39.103
He couldn't help himself.

29:39.177 --> 29:41.611
He's the guy.
Who's the guy?

29:44.115 --> 29:47.141
Julie, we have to go right now.
Why?

29:47.218 --> 29:49.448
I can't tell you now.
Not here.

29:49.521 --> 29:51.716

Hey! What?
[Sighs]

29:55.026 --> 29:58.257
Look, what's going on?
She's taking Julie home.

29:58.329 --> 30:01.765
Well, why on earth
would she do that?

30:01.833 --> 30:06.099
Because I told her that you
killed Clea Vance a year ago.

30:07.806 --> 30:12.368
And I'm betting that you killed
Natasia Zorelle last night.

30:12.443 --> 30:16.812
Who else would have straightened
the clothes on Clea Vance's body?

30:16.881 --> 30:19.475
Oh, and why would I do
something like that?

30:21.753 --> 30:23.880
I would have.
Is that it?

30:23.955 --> 30:28.187
I straightened out the clothes?
[Scoffs]
I mean, that's not evidence.

30:28.259 --> 30:30.318
That-That's a hunch.

30:30.395 --> 30:34.388
That's all it is so far.

30:34.465 --> 30:37.059
You trust your instincts,
don't you?

30:37.135 --> 30:39.069
Oh, yes.

30:39.137 --> 30:42.334
And would it be the same
infallible instinct that you used...

30:42.407 --> 30:45.467
when you picked out
that jacket?

30:45.543 --> 30:49.411
Or when you did those buttons
right up to the top on your shirt,
eh?

30:49.480 --> 30:53.314
[Scoffs] What about
the evidence, Mr. Monk?

30:53.384 --> 30:56.319
What about-
You've heard of D.N.A., right?

30:56.387 --> 30:58.617
I mean, does that
ring a bell here? Hmm?

30:58.690 --> 31:01.784
D.N.A., yes.
The fibers, the hair
and the blood.

31:01.860 --> 31:06.126
They all belonged to that boy,
Pablo Ortiz, who's in jail.

31:06.197 --> 31:10.463
It couldn't have been me.
Just not possible.

31:12.237 --> 31:14.467
You're right.

31:14.539 --> 31:17.531
It's not possible.

31:17.609 --> 31:19.702
But you did it.

31:29.554 --> 31:31.613
Gordo, thanks
for getting here so fast.

31:31.689 --> 31:33.680
Sure, what's going on?
Get a load of this.

31:33.758 --> 31:37.592
Okay, there was a fashion show
upstairs in the ballroom.
I remember, last year.

31:37.662 --> 31:40.961
And one of the models,
as you know, showed up drunk.

31:41.032 --> 31:44.832
Clea Vance.
Exactly. So drunk,
according toJulian Hodge,

31:44.903 --> 31:46.894
that she almost
ruined his show.

31:46.971 --> 31:50.031
He was furious. I think
he followed her down here.

31:50.108 --> 31:52.099
They argued.
He lost control.

31:52.176 --> 31:55.634
He killed her. He beat her
to death right here.
Julian Hodge?

31:55.713 --> 31:59.843
What about the evidence?
He planted it. He framed Pablo Ortiz.

31:59.918 --> 32:02.409
Is that possible?
How could he plant
all that evidence...

32:02.487 --> 32:04.580
and clean up every
trace of himself?

32:04.656 --> 32:06.715
Actually he didn't.
He missed something.
Check this out.

32:06.791 --> 32:10.124
There was a health
inspection the day before.
They hung that flypaper in the corner.

32:10.194 --> 32:14.756
- How'd we miss it?
- We just found it this morning
behind that radiator.

32:14.832 --> 32:18.962
It must have fallen back there
during the fight. And, look, there's
three or four hairs stuck to it.

32:19.037 --> 32:22.200
And they can't be from Clea Vance
because she had long hair.

32:22.273 --> 32:26.642
They must belong toJulian Hodge,
the real killer.
This is the proof we need.

32:26.711 --> 32:28.770
How soon can you do a test
on those?
I'll get right on it.

32:28.846 --> 32:31.781
Good work.

Howard is one of our

Oh. How do you do?

37:56.374 --> 38:00.174
He's been examining some
evidence that we just uncovered
in the Clea Vance case.

38:00.244 --> 38:02.269
What, new evidence?

38:02.346 --> 38:05.144
That's right.
Four strands of human hair found
at the scene of the crime.

38:05.216 --> 38:07.446
For the record, Gordo,
is this your report?

38:07.518 --> 38:10.043
For the record, yes, it is.
Uh-huh.

38:10.121 --> 38:13.522
- And you examined these hair samples
that we found earlier today?
- <i>I did.</i>

38:13.591 --> 38:18.619
- And were you able to match these
hairs to any individual?
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

38:18.696 --> 38:22.291
- And for the record, who do
these hairs belong to?
- Pablo Ortiz.

but you're under arrest.

Accessory to murder
and falsifying evidence.
What?

38:41.819 --> 38:44.754
Here's what I couldn't
figure out.

38:44.822 --> 38:47.586
If you were guilty, how
could all the evidence
point somewhere else?

38:47.658 --> 38:50.559
There could be only
one possible answer.

38:50.628 --> 38:52.892
There was something wrong
with the evidence.

38:52.963 --> 38:58.128
<i>We did some digging, Gordo.</i>
<i>You did make a lot of money this year,</i>
<i>but it wasn't in real estate.</i>

38:58.202 --> 39:00.261
Here's what happened.

39:00.338 --> 39:03.535
<i>When you did the forensic work</i>
<i>on the Clea Vance murder,</i>

39:03.607 --> 39:08.237
<i>you realized all the evidence</i>
<i>pointed toJulian Hodge.</i>

39:08.312 --> 39:11.543
<i>You decided to cash in.</i>

39:11.615 --> 39:14.516
<i>You made Hodge an offer</i>
<i>he was in no position to refuse.</i>

39:14.585 --> 39:17.713
<i>For a price, you'd bury</i>
<i>the evidence against him.</i>

39:17.788 --> 39:21.280
<i>There was only one problem.</i>

39:21.359 --> 39:24.817
You had to close the case.
You needed a fall guy.

39:24.895 --> 39:27.830
Hodge remembered a young
delivery boy named Pablo Ortiz,

39:27.898 --> 39:29.889
a poor kid, barely spoke
any English.

39:29.967 --> 39:31.958
He was a perfect patsy.

39:32.036 --> 39:35.062
Hodge got Natasia to help him.
She called the police...

39:35.139 --> 39:37.869
and accused Ortiz
of stalking her roommate.

39:37.942 --> 39:40.376
<i>The police arrested Pablo.</i>

39:40.444 --> 39:43.242
<i>They took hair and blood samples</i>
<i>and sent them to you</i>- 

39:43.314 --> 39:45.578
<i>And the rest was easy.</i>

39:45.649 --> 39:48.516
<i>All you had to do</i>
<i>was re-label them.</i>

39:51.989 --> 39:54.321
- Pablo never had a chance.
- You can't prove any of this.

39:54.392 --> 39:57.452
We don't have to.
You proved it for us
five minutes ago...

39:57.528 --> 40:02.227
when you swore that these hair samples
belonged to Pablo Ortiz.

40:02.299 --> 40:04.767
So you planted that hair
to test him?

40:04.835 --> 40:07.633
Well, yeah.

40:07.705 --> 40:10.936
Whose hair was it?
It was mine.

40:11.008 --> 40:13.806
Natalie pulled it out
with a tweezer.
She just yanked it out.

40:13.878 --> 40:16.506
What was I supposed to do?
You could have cut them
like I told you to.

40:16.580 --> 40:18.912
We needed the follicles.
No, we didn't need the follicles...

40:18.983 --> 40:21.577
because we knew he wasn't
going to test anything.

40:21.652 --> 40:24.621
That was the whole point.
It's embarrassing.
Okay, don't be such a baby.

40:24.688 --> 40:26.781
Hang on. Hang on!

40:26.857 --> 40:30.315
I forgot what we were doing.
Oh, yeah, we're arresting you two.

40:30.394 --> 40:33.830
You know the drill, Gordo.

40:35.833 --> 40:37.994
So, it's true what they say, huh?

40:38.068 --> 40:40.969
You can never judge a person
by how they dress.

40:41.038 --> 40:44.496
Well, you know what?
Let me tell you what
you're gonna be wearing.

40:44.575 --> 40:46.907
I hope you like orange.
It's a little jumpsuit thing.

40:46.977 --> 40:49.537
It has a number right here.
You can wear it anywhere, really-

40:49.613 --> 40:51.706
Indoors, walking around the yard-

40:58.923 --> 41:02.381
[Sobbing]

41:02.460 --> 41:05.952
[Speaking Spanish]

41:06.030 --> 41:09.659
[Gate Buzzer Buzzes]
Mama.

41:11.936 --> 41:16.532
Thank you, Mr, Monk.
How can I repay you,
Mr. Monk?

41:16.607 --> 41:21.601
I have no money.
Now that you mention it,
it is only 2:30.

41:21.679 --> 41:26.742
If we left now, you could be
back at work at 3:15,
put in a couple of hours,

41:26.817 --> 41:29.377
inspect, what, 90,
maybe a hundred shirts.

41:29.453 --> 41:33.583
But I took the day off.
No, no, no, no.
You don't wanna do that.

41:33.657 --> 41:37.388
No. You're Inspector Number 8.
You have a lot of people
depending on you.

41:37.461 --> 41:40.521
Mr. Monk, I'm sure
they would like to visit.
You know? Catch up.

41:40.598 --> 41:44.534
Yeah, there's plenty of time
for that. They got the whole
weekend for that.

41:44.602 --> 41:46.536
Unless you wanna work
on Saturday.

41:46.604 --> 41:49.300
[Speaking Spanish] Saturday?
[Speaks Spanish]

41:49.373 --> 41:51.364
<i>Shh.</i>

41:51.442 --> 41:54.138
<i>Overtime?</i>
<i>You like overtime?</i>

41:55.305 --> 42:01.492
