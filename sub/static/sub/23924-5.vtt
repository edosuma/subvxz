Mmm.
Maybe <i> I</i> could help.

10:03.363 --> 10:04.677
Ew.

10:04.769 --> 10:06.727
Riches. Riches.

10:06.796 --> 10:10.513
Now, how do I open the door
to the riches of the ancients?

10:10.582 --> 10:13.013
Place the Gorzoth there.

10:13.083 --> 10:14.489
- Yes.
- Or

10:14.606 --> 10:16.536
how about a visit
to the gift shop?

10:16.605 --> 10:18.888
Key chain? T-Shirt?
Corn dog?

10:18.957 --> 10:21.591
What? No, you idiot.
I want riches.

10:21.660 --> 10:23.652
Riches! Riches!

10:23.861 --> 10:26.895
It worked. The riches,
they're in here.

10:26.964 --> 10:29.544
Huh?
Hey, it's just a bunch of heads.

10:29.613 --> 10:33.731
But in ancient times, heads
were considered very valuable.

10:34.678 --> 10:37.295
Master, your money's no good here.

10:37.364 --> 10:40.317
Well, if you insist.
One jar of pickles...

10:40.386 --> 10:43.028
That will be... 25 heads.

10:43.097 --> 10:45.706
At last, the Gorzoth!
