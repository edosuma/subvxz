I'’m just glad you
decided to give him up.

01:08.329 --> 01:09.678
Give him up?

01:09.721 --> 01:11.114
We had two dates,
ten years ago.

01:11.158 --> 01:13.551
It was hardly
an investment.

01:13.595 --> 01:17.555

two of you would click.

to get hitched,

it'’d be someone
like Marci...

never have you.

I genuinely wish
you happiness.

grateful that I have you.

06:12.023 --> 06:13.460
Me too.

06:13.503 --> 06:16.854
And that I was there to take
you in all those years ago,

06:16.898 --> 06:19.901
because it was my brother'’s
dying wish to take you away

06:19.944 --> 06:24.340
from that horrible
woman he married.

06:24.384 --> 06:27.038
But apparently
that wasn'’t enough

06:27.082 --> 06:29.867
to make you care
about me or him,

06:29.911 --> 06:33.218
the way you always leave
whenever the hell you want to,

06:33.262 --> 06:35.873

and I got, umm,

06:37.919 --> 06:39.094
caught in traffic...

06:39.137 --> 06:42.489
An errand?
What errand?

06:42.532 --> 06:46.362
I had to get some fabric
from the garment district.

06:46.406 --> 06:48.146
Did I send you there?

06:48.190 --> 06:52.150
Did I tell you
to get fabrics?

06:52.194 --> 06:55.980
No, it'’s for me.

06:56.024 --> 06:57.591
I'’m making
myself a dress.

06:57.634 --> 06:59.157
A dress, what for?

06:59.201 --> 07:01.421
Who are you
trying to impress?

07:01.464 --> 07:05.120
I hope you'’re not
acting up again.

07:05.163 --> 07:07.165
I'’m not.

07:07.209 --> 07:11.300
You always lie, so why
am I wasting my time?

07:11.343 --> 07:14.477
Just finish
the alterations.

07:14.521 --> 07:17.132
Go!

07:17.437 --> 07:20.483
Yes, Auntie.

07:53.560 --> 07:56.519
And be back before the
five o'’clock fitting!

07:56.563 --> 07:58.695

I'’m sorry.

08:44.524 --> 08:48.136
Hey, it'’s
Marci, right?

08:48.179 --> 08:50.355
I'’m so sorry,
I'’m drawing a blank?

08:50.399 --> 08:51.705
It'’s Jenna.

08:51.748 --> 08:53.533
I work for Aunt Daisy.

08:53.576 --> 08:54.708
Your wedding dress.

08:54.751 --> 08:56.013
Oh my gosh, yes!

08:56.057 --> 08:57.711
Yes, of course.

08:57.754 --> 08:59.974
If you could'’ve seen how many
compliments I got on the day.

09:00.017 --> 09:01.279
Thank you.

09:01.323 --> 09:03.064
It was our pleasure,
of course.

09:03.107 --> 09:08.286
Um, so how did
the wedding go?

09:08.330 --> 09:11.289
Umm, oh it
was great.

09:11.333 --> 09:13.378
Yeah, I don'’t know
where to begin.

09:13.422 --> 09:14.554
It was good!

09:16.686 --> 09:18.209
How'’s Glenn?

09:18.253 --> 09:19.559
That'’s his
name, right?

09:19.602 --> 09:20.560
Yeah.

09:20.603 --> 09:22.039
He'’s fine, he's good.

09:22.083 --> 09:23.519
Good.

09:23.563 --> 09:26.174
Honestly, before him I never
imagined myself as a bride.

09:26.217 --> 09:28.045
I had kind of
given up on the whole

09:28.089 --> 09:31.483
traditional marriage thing,
you know what I mean?

09:31.527 --> 09:33.094
Not really.

09:33.137 --> 09:36.401
I'’ve always imagined I'd
meet the perfect man and,

09:36.445 --> 09:38.403
you know, have
a dream wedding.

09:38.447 --> 09:40.449
But I don'’t get the chance
to meet many single guys,

09:40.492 --> 09:42.277
especially in
my profession.

09:42.320 --> 09:44.496
Well if you can break
away from your schedule,

09:44.540 --> 09:46.673
my friend Chelsea
- my maid of honor -

09:46.716 --> 09:49.632
is throwing Glenn and I
a little honeymoon luau.

09:49.676 --> 09:51.591
There will be lots
of single guys there!

09:51.634 --> 09:54.419
I could introduce you!

09:54.463 --> 09:56.291
Yeah!

10:13.830 --> 10:15.092
Oh!

10:16.180 --> 10:17.573
You scared me.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.314
The only reason
a woman exercises

10:19.357 --> 10:22.404
is she'’s trying to get
over a man, or land one.

10:22.447 --> 10:25.537
And we definitely know
it'’s not the former.

10:25.581 --> 10:28.671
So, what'’s the story?

10:28.715 --> 10:32.501
I'’m just, just trying
to stay healthy.

10:32.544 --> 10:34.372
We sit hunched over
at our desks all day

10:34.416 --> 10:36.679
and the last
thing I want is--

10:36.723 --> 10:40.291
--is to become
like me. Hmm?

10:40.335 --> 10:41.684
I didn'’t say that.

10:41.728 --> 10:42.772
Yeah.

10:42.816 --> 10:44.382
You think you can
just find a man

10:44.426 --> 10:46.341
and get me out
of your life

10:46.384 --> 10:49.866
and take this house
away from me, huh?

10:49.910 --> 10:51.476
You'’ll always
be in my life.

10:51.520 --> 10:55.176
I bet you'’re counting
the days until I'’m not,

10:55.219 --> 10:57.787
but guess what missy?

10:57.831 --> 11:01.269
My genes, all the women
on your father'’s side

11:01.312 --> 11:05.621
always live to be
octogenarians, okay?

11:05.665 --> 11:08.842
Well then, I
should be thankful.

11:08.885 --> 11:10.713
Except you'’re too
much like your mother,

11:10.757 --> 11:16.197
too confused in your head,
so I wouldn'’t count on it.

11:16.240 --> 11:20.201
Face it, nobody would
ever put up with you.

11:20.244 --> 11:23.465
Especially a man.

11:23.508 --> 11:27.904
The only thing that you
can count on is your work.

11:27.948 --> 11:31.865
So change your clothes
and get back to it.

11:40.961 --> 11:42.745
So I was at
the gym today

11:42.789 --> 11:47.837
and I ran into the girl who
helped make my wedding dress.

11:47.881 --> 11:50.710
I thought you said
she was kind of old.

11:50.753 --> 11:53.451
No, not Mrs. Kravitz,

11:53.495 --> 11:55.976
her niece who works
with her, Jenna.

11:56.019 --> 11:57.717
She'’s about our age.

11:57.760 --> 12:00.371
She'’s really nice, so I invited
her to the party on Saturday.

12:00.415 --> 12:02.156
Cool.

12:02.199 --> 12:06.726
She'’s kind of shy, so I thought
about introducing her to Scott.

12:06.769 --> 12:07.552
Really?

12:07.596 --> 12:09.206
Yeah.

12:09.250 --> 12:13.602
You know, someone like him might
help her break out of her shell.

12:13.645 --> 12:18.215
You'’re just asking for trouble
if you want my humble opinion.

12:18.259 --> 12:20.914
Speaking of which, did
your mom make it home okay?

12:20.957 --> 12:22.742
Yeah.

12:22.785 --> 12:24.744
Did she say anything?

12:24.787 --> 12:27.355
About your dad
not showing up?

12:27.398 --> 12:29.661
Nope...

12:29.705 --> 12:32.882
Hey, it'’s his loss.

12:32.926 --> 12:36.233
Yeah, his loss...

12:38.627 --> 12:40.934
You know maybe if I had just
forgiven him for cheating

12:40.977 --> 12:45.547
and gotten my mom
to follow suit, but...

12:46.853 --> 12:51.031
but he just
devastated her.

12:54.861 --> 12:57.951
We are not
your parents.

12:57.994 --> 13:00.562
I love you.

13:02.433 --> 13:03.913
I love you too.

13:17.709 --> 13:21.539
Face it, nobody would
ever put up with you!

13:21.583 --> 13:24.673
Especially a man.

13:24.716 --> 13:26.893
You'’re too much
like your mother,

13:26.936 --> 13:30.331
you'’re too
confused in your head.

13:30.374 --> 13:33.856
You being you...

13:33.900 --> 13:37.381
You can'’t get me
out of your life!

14:24.472 --> 14:25.908
Why thank you, Glenn.

14:25.952 --> 14:29.651
It'’s good to see
you again as well.

14:29.694 --> 14:32.697
Just a few
more curls...

14:32.741 --> 14:35.613
and then we'’re perfect.

14:38.878 --> 14:43.012
Yes, that'’s right...

14:43.056 --> 14:48.365
the 12th, it'’ll be
ready, don'’t you worry...

14:51.760 --> 14:53.022
Okay...

14:54.676 --> 14:57.722
That sounds fine.

14:57.766 --> 15:00.160
We'’ll see you then, okay?

15:00.203 --> 15:01.944
Buh-bye.

15:23.139 --> 15:25.533
You made it!

15:25.576 --> 15:27.448
I did, yeah.

15:27.491 --> 15:28.536
It took some convincing,

15:28.579 --> 15:30.059
but Auntie finally
gave me the day off.

15:30.103 --> 15:31.495
Auntie?

15:31.539 --> 15:34.672
You call her Auntie?
That is so regal.

15:34.716 --> 15:36.500
Yeah, I guess.

15:36.544 --> 15:38.154
It'’s just what I've
always called her.

15:38.198 --> 15:40.809
The bartender is making
a helluva daiquiri.

15:40.852 --> 15:42.071
Can I get you one?

15:42.115 --> 15:42.985
A wine, please.

15:43.029 --> 15:44.465
Strawberry'’s the best.

15:44.508 --> 15:46.641
I'’m getting you a
strawberry one. Come on!

15:46.684 --> 15:49.122
Cute dress!
Where'’s that from?

15:49.165 --> 15:52.429
I did it
myself last night.

15:52.473 --> 15:56.520
Now that is certainly a
talent that I would love.

15:56.564 --> 15:57.086
Cheers.

15:57.130 --> 15:59.132
Cheers.

15:59.175 --> 16:00.524
So, I know
you'’re single

16:00.568 --> 16:03.005
and I think I found
the perfect guy for you.

16:03.049 --> 16:04.006
Really?

16:04.050 --> 16:05.573
Yes!

16:05.616 --> 16:07.662
His name is Scott, he was
Glenn'’s best man at our wedding.

16:07.705 --> 16:11.057
He'’s super cute,
the life of the party.

16:11.100 --> 16:13.450
He'’s standing
right behind you.

16:19.065 --> 16:20.980
He seems busy.

16:21.023 --> 16:22.894
I'’ll give you a proper
introduction later.

16:22.938 --> 16:24.548
Okay.

16:24.592 --> 16:26.115
That was Chelsea, right?

16:26.159 --> 16:27.769
She was with you when you
came in for your measurements.

16:27.812 --> 16:30.990
Yeah, but she'’s
totally not into him.

16:32.078 --> 16:34.602
It'’s so nice of her
to throw this party.

16:34.645 --> 16:37.126
Her house is beautiful.

16:37.170 --> 16:39.824
You all seem so close.

16:41.913 --> 16:43.176
Oh!

16:43.219 --> 16:44.873
I need to go
say hi to someone.

16:44.916 --> 16:46.744
Are you okay
here for a minute?

16:46.788 --> 16:47.745
I'’ll be fine.

16:47.789 --> 16:49.921
Okay, I'’ll just
be a minute.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.778
Don'’t I know you
from somewhere?

17:20.821 --> 17:21.605
I--

17:21.648 --> 17:23.172
The dressmaker!

17:23.215 --> 17:25.087
Yeah.

17:25.131 --> 17:27.655
How'’s married life?

17:27.698 --> 17:30.919
You know, it'’s not exactly
what I thought it would be.

17:30.962 --> 17:33.704
You two seem so
perfect together.

17:33.748 --> 17:35.228
Sometimes I feel like
we'’re putting on a front

17:35.271 --> 17:37.099
for our friends
and family.

17:37.143 --> 17:40.059
That we'’re not
really soul mates.

17:40.102 --> 17:42.191
I'’m so sorry to hear.

17:42.235 --> 17:44.889
You know, I think
about the moment we met.

17:44.933 --> 17:48.676
Maybe we missed
an opportunity.

17:48.719 --> 17:51.113
I'’ve been hurt
in the past

17:51.157 --> 17:54.073
when I tried to
get close to someone.

18:00.601 --> 18:03.995
I'’ll never hurt you.

18:04.039 --> 18:05.649
Then how
would this work?

18:05.693 --> 18:07.216
Anyone that might
detract from us,

18:07.260 --> 18:10.176
you'’ll just have
to do some things.

18:10.219 --> 18:13.527
Unpleasant things.

18:13.570 --> 18:15.529
Do you think you
can do that for us?

18:15.572 --> 18:17.270
I do.

18:23.014 --> 18:25.756
Do you need a top up?

18:25.800 --> 18:28.107
Uh, no thank you.

18:28.150 --> 18:33.286
So, how do you know the
lovely wedded couple?

18:33.329 --> 18:34.896
I'’m friends
with Marci.

18:34.939 --> 18:36.202
I'’m Jenna.

18:36.245 --> 18:38.856
Oh, you'’re the girl
from the golf course.

18:38.900 --> 18:41.294
Marci told
me about you.

18:41.337 --> 18:44.079
She was not kidding.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.647
What did she say?

18:46.690 --> 18:48.736
That there was this
woman I should meet,

18:48.779 --> 18:51.826
who'’s smart
and attractive.

18:51.869 --> 18:57.353
But that she needed a
little help believing that.

18:57.397 --> 19:02.532
So uh, do you
want me to help you

19:02.576 --> 19:07.015
so you can understand just
how attractive you really are?

19:08.277 --> 19:10.932
I think I'’ll
go find Marci.

19:10.975 --> 19:11.889
Now.

19:13.369 --> 19:16.067
It was nice
meeting you...

19:16.111 --> 19:18.069
we'’ll talk later.

21:34.205 --> 21:35.903
What?

21:35.946 --> 21:39.036
What is it you
wanted to show me?

21:39.080 --> 21:40.342
It'’s in here.

21:42.866 --> 21:44.912
We won'’t be
long, honey.

21:44.955 --> 21:47.306
We can'’t ignore
our guests.

21:47.349 --> 21:50.004
Come on, this is
what newlyweds do!

21:50.047 --> 21:51.397
We'’re on our honeymoon.

22:26.997 --> 22:28.390
Hey, I was
looking for you.

22:28.434 --> 22:30.305
I was looking for
you too, actually.

22:30.349 --> 22:31.915
Really?

22:31.959 --> 22:37.181
Yeah, I feel like I was rude
earlier and I'’m sorry if I was.

22:37.225 --> 22:38.618
Not at all.

22:38.661 --> 22:40.446
I can handle rejection.

22:40.489 --> 22:43.231
Did I reject you?

22:43.274 --> 22:45.581
You walked away, so...

22:45.625 --> 22:49.977
Technically you never asked me
a question I could say no to.

22:50.020 --> 22:52.371
What are you
doing right now?

22:52.414 --> 22:55.417
I was umm, thinking
about leaving.

22:55.461 --> 22:57.245
Me too.

22:57.288 --> 22:59.595
Wanna get out
of here together?

22:59.639 --> 23:02.163
No.

23:02.206 --> 23:06.210
Now that'’s a
rejection, right?

23:06.254 --> 23:08.604
Why don'’t you
follow me to my place?

23:08.648 --> 23:10.084
Okay.

23:26.927 --> 23:28.319
Hey!

23:28.363 --> 23:29.233
Here we are.

23:29.277 --> 23:30.278
Okay.

23:31.497 --> 23:34.325
And right through here.

23:34.369 --> 23:35.501
After you.

23:35.544 --> 23:36.458
Thank you.

23:36.502 --> 23:38.199
You got it.

23:42.116 --> 23:43.944
All right, you ready?

23:48.688 --> 23:50.472
Here we are.

23:50.516 --> 23:52.387
Chateau Scott.

23:54.128 --> 23:56.260
This way.

23:59.525 --> 24:01.875
You umm, have
a nice place.

24:01.918 --> 24:03.485
Very manly.

24:03.529 --> 24:07.489
Some are not
into my taste.

24:07.533 --> 24:11.493
Well, I hate
judgmental people.

24:11.537 --> 24:14.148
Me too.

24:14.191 --> 24:17.020
Please, a wine
would be fine.

24:17.064 --> 24:19.588
You'’ll like this,
trust me.

24:25.551 --> 24:26.465
What is it?

24:26.508 --> 24:28.249
It'’s bourbon.

24:28.292 --> 24:30.164
For Glenn'’s bachelor
party, we toured some

24:30.207 --> 24:33.515
Kentucky distilleries
and this was my favorite.

24:33.559 --> 24:36.692
Anything less harsh?

24:36.736 --> 24:39.216
Usually I'’d
consider this a sin,

24:39.260 --> 24:44.613
but it'’ll help take the
initial sting out for a rookie.

24:44.657 --> 24:46.528
Well, I hope I'’m
not offending you.

24:46.572 --> 24:50.445
No, it'’s fine.

24:53.709 --> 24:57.234
It'’s good.

24:57.278 --> 24:59.585
Dad said it would
put hair on your chest.

25:01.587 --> 25:03.458
Hey...

25:06.592 --> 25:10.030
Do you feel like
playing a game?

25:10.073 --> 25:11.597
I'’m horrible at games.

25:11.640 --> 25:13.294
No, no.

25:13.337 --> 25:14.513
This way.

25:16.340 --> 25:19.213
This is a game
where even if you lose,

25:19.256 --> 25:21.389
we both can still win.

25:21.432 --> 25:25.175
See, it'’s not
just about

25:25.219 --> 25:27.264
being the one to not
knock over the tower,

25:27.308 --> 25:31.007
because certain
pieces have a dare.

25:31.051 --> 25:32.966
A challenge for the players.

25:33.009 --> 25:34.358
For example...

25:38.711 --> 25:43.324
Player One, please remove
one piece of clothing.

25:44.717 --> 25:47.371
You think you
can handle this?

25:50.418 --> 25:53.813
I think I'’ll need
another first.

25:53.856 --> 25:55.684
No ice.

25:55.728 --> 25:57.164
Okay...

26:20.579 --> 26:21.623
Cheers.

26:21.667 --> 26:23.103
Cheers.

26:56.571 --> 26:57.746
So?

26:57.790 --> 27:00.314
Jenna?

27:00.357 --> 27:01.794
You never
answered my question.

27:01.837 --> 27:03.273
Can you handle this?

27:03.317 --> 27:04.797
The game?

27:04.840 --> 27:06.625
It'’s just...

27:06.668 --> 27:11.325
I'’ve never done
anything like this before.

27:11.368 --> 27:12.718
Don'’t worry.

27:12.761 --> 27:15.677
We'’re just having
a little bit of fun.

27:21.727 --> 27:23.250
Now...

27:24.381 --> 27:25.731
Ladies first.

27:37.830 --> 27:39.440
Read it.

27:41.834 --> 27:45.794
Player One must
kiss another Player.

27:45.838 --> 27:49.232
Oh no, darn the luck.

27:49.276 --> 27:51.278
I guess that
has to be me.

27:56.283 --> 27:57.763
Close your eyes.

27:57.806 --> 27:59.503
I won'’t bite.

27:59.547 --> 28:01.505
Unless you ask me to.

28:14.867 --> 28:15.781
What?

28:15.824 --> 28:18.653
What happened?
What'’s wrong?

28:18.697 --> 28:20.699
I think I need to leave.

28:20.742 --> 28:21.787
I think I'’ve done enough.

28:21.830 --> 28:22.657
I need to leave.

28:22.701 --> 28:23.702
Whoa, wait.

28:23.745 --> 28:24.485
Did I do something
to offend you?

28:24.528 --> 28:26.226
I said I need to leave!

28:26.269 --> 28:27.357
Dammit.

28:27.401 --> 28:28.707
Hey, Jenna!

28:50.859 --> 28:53.819
Help!
Help me!

29:05.918 --> 29:07.223
Hello?

29:07.267 --> 29:08.877
He wouldn'’t let me leave!

29:08.921 --> 29:10.792
I wanted to go, but he
wouldn'’t let me leave.

29:10.836 --> 29:12.098
Jenna?

29:12.141 --> 29:13.795
Jenna, slow down.
Who wouldn'’t let you go?

29:13.839 --> 29:15.231
Scott!

29:15.275 --> 29:16.319
Where are you now?

29:16.363 --> 29:17.843
In my car.

29:17.886 --> 29:19.235
You'’re safe?

29:19.279 --> 29:20.846
I think.

29:20.889 --> 29:22.761
I don'’t think he followed me.

29:22.804 --> 29:24.763
Okay, I want you to
come over to my house.

29:24.806 --> 29:25.764
Okay.

30:03.932 --> 30:05.586
Other side.

30:24.431 --> 30:25.736
Here.

30:27.869 --> 30:29.523
Thank you.

30:31.046 --> 30:34.397
Do you want to
talk about it?

30:34.441 --> 30:38.749
I'’m just so embarrassed.

30:38.793 --> 30:40.403
I was so stupid.

30:40.447 --> 30:41.927
No.

30:41.970 --> 30:43.580
Don'’t be, this
isn'’t about you.

30:43.624 --> 30:45.017
This is about him.

30:45.060 --> 30:47.846
I know I shouldn'’t have,
but I went over to his place

30:47.889 --> 30:50.936
after the barbecue
thinking we'’d just...

30:50.979 --> 30:53.764
relax and have a drink.

30:53.808 --> 30:55.114
You know, it was
innocent enough

30:55.157 --> 30:58.987
until he wanted
to play this game.

30:59.031 --> 31:02.034
This game where if
you remove a block--

31:02.077 --> 31:03.992
I know that game.

31:04.036 --> 31:05.951
That stupid-ass ploy.

31:05.994 --> 31:09.693
He'’s been doing
that since college.

31:09.737 --> 31:11.347
I can'’t believe
he'’s still doing that.

31:11.391 --> 31:16.831
And I had to kiss him, but
when I did and pulled away,

31:16.875 --> 31:19.965
he said, that'’s not
the rules of the game.

31:20.008 --> 31:24.621
Why are you being so
weird and such a prude?

31:24.665 --> 31:28.887
Why are you
being so uptight?

31:28.930 --> 31:32.020
Hey, it'’s okay.

31:33.108 --> 31:36.720
The game saved me.

31:36.764 --> 31:39.898
If it hadn'’t fallen over when
we struggled and distracted him,

31:39.941 --> 31:42.988
I don'’t know what
would have happened.

31:43.031 --> 31:45.033
You have to go
to the police.

31:45.077 --> 31:46.426
But he'’s your friend.

31:46.469 --> 31:47.906
No friend of
mine does this.

31:47.949 --> 31:51.692
He needs to get
what he deserves.

31:51.735 --> 31:55.043
I'’m so sorry
I suggested that

31:55.087 --> 31:58.046
the you two of
you should go out.

32:00.744 --> 32:02.921
That'’s Glenn.

32:02.964 --> 32:05.662
He was returning
some party rentals.

32:11.799 --> 32:15.672
Oh my god,
what happened?

32:21.635 --> 32:23.158
Someone beat up her up.

32:23.202 --> 32:25.813
I can see that.

32:25.856 --> 32:28.685
Scott beat her up.

32:28.729 --> 32:30.687
Are you serious?

32:30.731 --> 32:34.735
They went out tonight
and he assaulted her.

32:34.778 --> 32:37.129
Okay, I know Scott, he would
not do something like that.

32:37.172 --> 32:39.174
Well then how do
you explain it?

32:39.218 --> 32:41.089
There must be some
other explanation.

32:41.133 --> 32:42.612
It just doesn'’t
make any sense.

32:42.656 --> 32:44.049
It'’s not that
far fetched.

32:44.092 --> 32:45.528
You know how
aggressive he gets.

32:45.572 --> 32:46.747
He probably
drank too much.

32:46.790 --> 32:48.140
Aggressive doesn'’t
mean violent!

32:48.183 --> 32:50.011
So you want to blame her?
Blame the victim?

32:50.055 --> 32:51.230
No, I am not
saying that!

32:51.273 --> 32:52.709
Then what'’re you saying?

32:52.753 --> 32:54.624
Just let me
go talk to him.

32:54.668 --> 32:55.712
No!

32:55.756 --> 32:57.932
He can'’t know
that she'’s here.

32:57.976 --> 33:00.630
He'’ll start stacking
up the sandbags

33:00.674 --> 33:03.677
and she'’s already worried
about pressing charges.

33:03.720 --> 33:05.548
Just...

33:13.948 --> 33:16.429
He doesn'’t
believe me.

33:16.472 --> 33:18.039
He'’s angry...

33:18.083 --> 33:19.084
No.

33:21.042 --> 33:22.739
When someone is so
close to someone,

33:22.783 --> 33:26.047
it'’s hard to
face the truth.

33:26.091 --> 33:28.223
I hope so.

33:28.267 --> 33:30.182
Come here.

33:34.925 --> 33:36.797
It'’s okay.

35:26.950 --> 35:28.169
What'’s this?

35:31.129 --> 35:33.000
Can'’t sleep?

35:33.043 --> 35:38.788
I was looking for a
glass for some water.

35:38.832 --> 35:42.096
Are you feeling better?

35:42.140 --> 35:44.707
I think I'’m
gonna leave.

35:44.751 --> 35:46.013
It'’s...

35:46.056 --> 35:48.146
it'’s in the middle
of the night.

35:48.189 --> 35:51.932
I have work,
a lot of work.

35:51.975 --> 35:53.673
I think you need to
take care of yourself.

35:53.716 --> 35:55.196
Work will help.

35:55.240 --> 35:57.372
Yes, I think
it'’ll help.

35:57.416 --> 35:59.635
You need
to be in bed.

35:59.679 --> 36:01.071
That'’s okay.

36:01.115 --> 36:02.856
Thanks for everything.

36:02.899 --> 36:05.250
Okay, well...

36:05.293 --> 36:08.035
let me know if
you need anything!

36:20.830 --> 36:23.050
Where have you been
all day and night?

36:23.093 --> 36:24.225
With friends.

36:24.269 --> 36:26.793
Ha! You don'’t have
any friends.

36:26.836 --> 36:28.447
I do, too.

36:28.490 --> 36:30.275
If you stopped criticizing me
for once and actually asked me

36:30.318 --> 36:32.668
about my life, then
maybe you'’d know.

36:32.712 --> 36:34.192
Oh, I know.

36:34.235 --> 36:36.237
I know, you'’re
doing it again.

36:36.281 --> 36:38.370
Otherwise why'’re you
dressed like that?

36:38.413 --> 36:39.980
I'’m not doing anything!

36:40.023 --> 36:40.981
It'’s just a dress.

36:41.024 --> 36:42.983
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

36:43.026 --> 36:45.986
What'’re all these
bruises from?

36:46.029 --> 36:47.727
Who is it?

36:47.770 --> 36:49.032
I don'’t know what
you'’re talking about.

36:49.076 --> 36:51.992
Is it one
of my clients?

36:52.035 --> 36:54.212
Just leave me alone!

36:54.255 --> 36:58.912
You don'’t
fool me, missy!

36:58.955 --> 37:03.003
You better watch out because
you'’re skating on thin ice!

37:10.880 --> 37:13.927
Alright, I'’m coming,
I'’m coming.

37:18.932 --> 37:21.108
Damn, man...

37:24.807 --> 37:26.896
You wanna tell me
about last night?

37:26.940 --> 37:28.724
Good morning
to you, too.

37:28.768 --> 37:31.161
What the hell are
you talking about?

37:31.205 --> 37:32.728
Jenna?

37:32.772 --> 37:35.253
Oh, yikes.

37:38.212 --> 37:40.127
So you guys did
get together?

37:40.170 --> 37:41.955
Not really.

37:41.998 --> 37:43.870
What'’s not really?

37:43.913 --> 37:45.872
She came over,
had a drink,

37:45.915 --> 37:47.961
I tried to get her
to play the game,

37:48.004 --> 37:49.919
she kinda freaked
out and left...

37:49.963 --> 37:51.791
What would cause
her to freak out?

37:51.834 --> 37:53.445
Hell if I know.

37:53.488 --> 37:56.317
We'’re making out, suddenly
she got cold feet and ran away.

37:56.361 --> 37:57.492
That'’s it?

37:57.536 --> 37:59.494
Yeah, that'’s it.

37:59.538 --> 38:01.801
What'’s all this about?

38:01.844 --> 38:04.717
She came over to our place
after she left here last night.

38:04.760 --> 38:06.806
Somebody really
did a number on her.

38:06.849 --> 38:08.111
That'’s horrible.

38:08.155 --> 38:10.288
Yeah, she said
you did it.

38:10.331 --> 38:12.855
What?

38:12.899 --> 38:15.162
I mean she'’s
lying, making it up.

38:15.205 --> 38:16.946
I barely laid
my hands on her.

38:16.990 --> 38:18.208
Laid your hands?

38:18.252 --> 38:19.775
No, not like that.

38:19.819 --> 38:21.342
We were going
at it, making out.

38:21.386 --> 38:22.909
When she stood up,
I grabbed her hand,

38:22.952 --> 38:25.738
she pulled it away, knocked
over the game and then she left.

38:25.781 --> 38:27.348
That was it.

38:27.392 --> 38:30.133
C'’mon man, you know I
couldn'’t do something like that.

38:30.177 --> 38:31.787
Right?

38:31.831 --> 38:34.312
Yeah.

38:34.355 --> 38:36.923
I didn'’t know I had
to convince you, buddy.

38:36.966 --> 38:38.794
You should see
the bruises.

38:38.838 --> 38:42.102
It was somebody
else, not me.

38:42.145 --> 38:44.887
Is Marci believing
this garbage?

38:44.931 --> 38:47.847
You should probably keep
your distance, all right?

38:47.890 --> 38:50.763
Jenna'’s not sure if she
wants to file a report.

38:50.806 --> 38:52.417
And you just want me
to wait until she does?

38:52.460 --> 38:55.071
No way.
She'’s lying!

38:55.115 --> 38:56.290
What'’re you gonna do?

38:56.334 --> 38:57.944
I won'’t let her
get away with it.

38:57.987 --> 38:59.902
I'’ll fight it.

39:06.909 --> 39:09.259
Jenna, you have
a visitor!

39:09.303 --> 39:10.870
Okay...

39:13.176 --> 39:15.004
Glenn?

39:20.096 --> 39:21.446
Hey...

39:23.186 --> 39:24.492
Why are you lying?

39:24.536 --> 39:26.276
Why are you saying
those things about me?

39:26.320 --> 39:27.800
I'’m not.

39:27.843 --> 39:28.975
You know what you did!

39:29.018 --> 39:30.324
I didn'’t touch you!

39:30.368 --> 39:31.804
Oh yeah?

39:31.847 --> 39:33.849
Then how do
you explain this?

39:33.893 --> 39:35.416
Maybe you did
it yourself!

39:35.460 --> 39:37.200
Oh sure, blame the victim.

39:37.244 --> 39:39.420
That'’s what you
men always do...

39:39.464 --> 39:41.814
If you don'’t quit
claiming this BS,

39:41.857 --> 39:45.513
I will sue you for
defamation and for slander!

39:45.557 --> 39:48.429
If you don'’t leave,
I'’m calling the police!

39:48.473 --> 39:50.518
Go ahead, I have
nothing to hide.

39:50.562 --> 39:53.956
Then the world will see what
a complete psycho you are!

39:54.000 --> 39:55.523
What'’s going on?

39:55.567 --> 39:57.351
Nothing.

39:57.395 --> 39:58.526
Nothing, I'’m outta here.

40:00.528 --> 40:04.140
I warned you,
I warned you.

40:04.184 --> 40:08.101
But you don'’t listen, you go
behind my back and do things...

40:08.144 --> 40:10.016
And now this.

40:10.059 --> 40:11.539
More trouble.

40:11.583 --> 40:13.976
You'’re just like your mother.

40:14.020 --> 40:16.892
I told my brother, I
- watch out for her.

40:16.936 --> 40:21.244
But he went ahead and
married her anyway.

40:21.288 --> 40:23.421
And then she killed him...

40:23.464 --> 40:27.425
she killed him...

40:27.468 --> 40:30.645
Daddy deserved it.

40:30.689 --> 40:32.430
What did you say?

40:32.473 --> 40:37.957
He was a monster,
just like you!

40:38.000 --> 40:41.308
Don'’t you dare talk about
your father that way...

40:41.351 --> 40:43.266
Mama and me, we
barely got away

40:43.310 --> 40:46.052
and then she died and
all I had left was you.

40:46.095 --> 40:48.315
But you'’re no better!

40:48.358 --> 40:51.623
Am I supposed to stand
here and take this?

40:51.666 --> 40:53.494
From an ugly, pitiful,

40:53.538 --> 40:55.975
ungrateful little
child like you?

40:56.018 --> 40:57.977
Who has nothing!

40:58.020 --> 41:00.153
Who is worthless!

41:00.196 --> 41:02.285
And now you'’re bringing
evil on this house...

41:02.329 --> 41:03.635
I won'’t have it.

41:03.678 --> 41:06.072
I want you out now!

41:06.115 --> 41:09.162
Go!

41:09.205 --> 41:12.382
You can die in the
street just like

41:12.426 --> 41:16.952
that piece of trash
you called Mama!

42:01.170 --> 42:02.389
Stop!

42:02.432 --> 42:04.522
Stop it!
Stop it!

45:05.398 --> 45:09.532
I can't thank you enough
for being here today.

45:09.576 --> 45:12.535
It means the world to us.

45:12.579 --> 45:16.322
But now we
must be going.

45:16.365 --> 45:19.847
He's sweeping me off
to Hawaii for two weeks.

45:19.891 --> 45:25.374
Yes, it's all very much
a dream come true.

45:30.292 --> 45:32.642
You ready honey?

45:32.686 --> 45:35.428
Yes, yes I am.

45:36.908 --> 45:40.476
There'’s no need
to be nervous.

45:40.520 --> 45:42.783
Who said anything
about being nervous?

46:21.256 --> 46:23.345
I love you.

46:23.389 --> 46:24.825
I love you.

46:24.869 --> 46:28.960
I love you!

48:54.975 --> 48:56.498
Hey.

48:58.848 --> 49:00.415
I didn'’t expect
you home so soon.

49:00.459 --> 49:01.895
You talked about a
day full of errands.

49:01.939 --> 49:02.983
I know.

49:03.027 --> 49:05.029
I was in the
middle of it.

49:05.072 --> 49:09.033
I just-- I just feel terrible
about Jenna and Scott.

49:09.076 --> 49:12.123
Listen, why don'’t I take
you out to an early dinner?

49:12.166 --> 49:15.822
We can just talk
about everything.

49:15.865 --> 49:17.955
That actually sounds great.

49:17.998 --> 49:19.478
Hey, I got this.

49:19.521 --> 49:21.828
You go do what
you need to do.

49:21.871 --> 49:24.613
Okay, thank you.

50:24.978 --> 50:26.066
What'’s this?

50:26.110 --> 50:27.111
You tell me.

50:27.154 --> 50:28.808
Are you going on a
sleepover somewhere?

50:28.851 --> 50:30.070
Do not make a
joke about this!

50:30.114 --> 50:30.940
About what?

50:30.984 --> 50:32.072
I don'’t know
what this is.

50:32.116 --> 50:33.117
This?
This is lipstick.

50:33.160 --> 50:34.640
On your pillow.

50:34.683 --> 50:37.512
And this is not my color.
I would not wear this shade.

50:37.556 --> 50:40.820
There'’s some cheap
scent on these sheets.

50:40.863 --> 50:42.169
Can you explain
this please?

50:42.213 --> 50:43.562
I can'’t.

50:43.605 --> 50:45.651
And I don'’t like
what you'’re implying.

50:45.694 --> 50:48.784
Listen, I know we'’re going
through this thing and you may

50:48.828 --> 50:49.959
have grown up with
some trust issues--

50:50.003 --> 50:51.265
Oh, that'’s not fair!

50:51.309 --> 50:52.788
But I didn'’t expect to
be accused of cheating

50:52.832 --> 50:54.616
in our first month
of marriage.

50:54.660 --> 50:56.792
Especially since I
didn'’t do anything!

50:56.836 --> 50:58.098
You know what?

50:58.142 --> 51:00.318
Let'’s not worry about
going out tonight.

51:00.361 --> 51:02.668
I'’ll find my own dinner.

52:01.074 --> 52:02.641
Ow!

52:57.870 --> 52:59.785
Come in, it'’s open.

53:01.830 --> 53:03.267
Hey sweetie!

53:03.310 --> 53:05.051
If you'’re here to see
if I'’m free for lunch,

53:05.094 --> 53:06.618
I don'’t think I
can sneak away.

53:06.661 --> 53:08.663
I have a client coming.

53:09.751 --> 53:12.232
Yeah, I bet you'’ve done enough
sneaking around all week.

53:12.276 --> 53:13.625
Excuse me?

53:18.282 --> 53:21.198
You found it,
thank god!

53:21.241 --> 53:22.808
I thought that
I lost this.

53:22.851 --> 53:24.897
I was dreading saying
anything to you.

53:24.940 --> 53:26.942
I found it in
Glenn'’s pants.

53:26.986 --> 53:28.117
What? That'’s weird.

53:28.161 --> 53:29.293
Is it?

53:29.336 --> 53:31.251
Were you at our
house yesterday?

53:31.295 --> 53:33.427
With Glenn?

53:33.471 --> 53:36.387
Are you really suggesting that
I'’m having an affair with Glenn?

53:36.430 --> 53:38.215
With my best
friend'’s husband?

53:38.258 --> 53:39.303
You tell me.

53:39.346 --> 53:41.261
I know you still
had a thing for him.

53:41.305 --> 53:42.871
No, I haven'’t.

53:42.915 --> 53:44.133
I handed him off to you.

53:44.177 --> 53:45.352
Oh, handed him off?

53:45.396 --> 53:47.049
Like sloppy seconds?

53:47.093 --> 53:50.836
You better take a breath,
before I really get upset.

53:52.054 --> 53:54.318
Recognize those?

53:54.361 --> 53:56.494
I found them in our bed.

53:56.537 --> 53:57.886
Where were
you yesterday?

53:57.930 --> 53:59.236
I don'’t know
what'’s going on here.

53:59.279 --> 54:00.846
Answer the question.

54:00.889 --> 54:02.413
If you think that I would risk
our friendship for an affair

54:02.456 --> 54:03.849
with Glenn, that
says a lot--

54:03.892 --> 54:05.720
Answer the question!

54:06.721 --> 54:08.288
You need to leave.

54:12.074 --> 54:15.295
Come back when you become
a little more rational.

54:18.733 --> 54:20.387
I think I am
quite rational!

54:20.431 --> 54:22.128
What are the odds
that another woman

54:22.171 --> 54:25.958
has the same earring
and underwear?

54:26.001 --> 54:28.395
Maybe your husband
has a panty fetish.

54:28.439 --> 54:30.484
And maybe he'’s a thief!

55:13.353 --> 55:14.354
Hey...

55:14.398 --> 55:15.529
Hi.

55:15.573 --> 55:17.226
Please come in.

55:19.446 --> 55:20.926
You didn'’t have
to do this.

55:20.969 --> 55:23.102
It'’s just a
small thanks.

55:32.459 --> 55:35.854
So after I stormed
out of Chelsea'’s place,

55:35.897 --> 55:37.899
I gave Glenn a
chance to come clean,

55:37.943 --> 55:40.206
but he denied it.

55:40.249 --> 55:42.077
So I asked him to leave.

55:42.121 --> 55:43.514
And he did...

55:45.080 --> 55:47.605
The wedding just
seems so distant now,

55:47.648 --> 55:53.132
with everything
that'’s happened.

55:53.175 --> 55:55.221
You know, it'’s not
much of a consolation,

55:55.264 --> 56:01.140
but I'’m really grateful
that we became friends.

56:01.183 --> 56:02.315
Me, too.

56:07.364 --> 56:09.496
I can'’t stop
thinking about my mom...

56:09.540 --> 56:12.238
for the past 20 years she
knew my dad was cheating on her,

56:12.281 --> 56:13.848
but she didn'’t do
anything about it.

56:13.892 --> 56:16.155
She couldn'’t leave
and I thought,

56:16.198 --> 56:19.158
what self-respect
does she have?

56:19.201 --> 56:22.422
But now that I'’m
in this situation,

56:22.466 --> 56:24.468
I don'’t know what
I'’m gonna do.

56:24.511 --> 56:27.471
Do you think you could
ever trust him again?

56:27.514 --> 56:30.865
I know I couldn'’t.

57:13.299 --> 57:16.258
My darling Glenn, I guess it
was only a matter of time.

57:16.302 --> 57:18.957
After our fun little afternoon
escapade at your house,

57:19.000 --> 57:20.611
we were bound
to be discovered.

57:20.654 --> 57:23.135
But now that we are,
we can tell Marci

57:23.178 --> 57:25.267
how much we'’ve been in
love since grad school.

57:25.311 --> 57:27.618
No more hiding, no
more sneaking around.

57:27.661 --> 57:30.359
It'’s our time.

57:30.403 --> 57:32.361
With all the love
in my heart,

57:32.405 --> 57:34.276
Eternally yours,
Chelsea.

57:34.320 --> 57:35.321
What the hell?

57:37.541 --> 57:39.412
What are you doing
in my house?

57:39.456 --> 57:40.631
On my computer?

57:40.674 --> 57:42.110
Marci!

57:42.154 --> 57:43.460
She sent me.

57:43.503 --> 57:44.983
You were sleeping
with Glenn.

57:45.026 --> 57:46.375
And she wanted
hard evidence.

57:46.419 --> 57:47.986
So she sent me.

57:48.029 --> 57:49.161
Bull.

57:49.204 --> 57:50.641
I'’m calling
the police.

58:50.178 --> 58:52.006
Smile!

59:22.036 --> 59:24.430
Be right there.

59:43.754 --> 59:45.582
Chelsea?

59:50.282 --> 59:52.763
Chels?

59:58.725 --> 01:00:00.597
Chelsea?

01:00:09.257 --> 01:00:11.433
No foreplay?

01:00:11.477 --> 01:00:14.393
I'’m glad you finally got
tired of playing hard to get.

01:00:58.393 --> 01:01:00.700
A Detective Moreno
called me?

01:01:00.744 --> 01:01:02.223
You Glenn Cooper?

01:01:02.267 --> 01:01:04.486
Right this way, please.

01:01:17.325 --> 01:01:18.457
Hey.

01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:19.719
Hi there.

01:01:19.763 --> 01:01:21.547
Thanks for coming.

01:01:21.590 --> 01:01:23.636
There is no next of kin,
but you were listed

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:25.943
on his cell phone
under favorites.

01:01:25.986 --> 01:01:27.858
Can you tell me
what this is about?

01:01:27.901 --> 01:01:30.774
Your friend is dead.

01:01:30.817 --> 01:01:32.297
Here?

01:01:33.341 --> 01:01:35.169
Where'’s Chelsea?

01:01:35.213 --> 01:01:36.867
I'’m afraid
she'’s dead, too.

01:01:43.525 --> 01:01:45.310
I don'’t understand.

01:01:45.353 --> 01:01:47.834
Can I get you some
water or something?

01:01:47.878 --> 01:01:49.662
This is gonna
destroy Marci.

01:01:49.706 --> 01:01:50.968
Marci?

01:01:51.011 --> 01:01:52.447
Yeah, she'’s my wife.

01:01:52.491 --> 01:01:56.321
She'’s Chelsea's
best friend.

01:01:56.364 --> 01:01:58.323
Can you tell me
what happened?

01:01:58.366 --> 01:02:01.543
It looks like Ms. Allen
invited Mr. Harrison over

01:02:01.587 --> 01:02:04.851
for some adult activities.

01:02:04.895 --> 01:02:06.592
There was an altercation.

01:02:06.635 --> 01:02:09.813
He stabbed her
and she shot him.

01:02:09.856 --> 01:02:13.686
Their relationship,
was it volatile?

01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:16.602
I didn'’t even know
they had a relationship.

01:02:16.645 --> 01:02:18.647
I mean, he was
always hitting on her

01:02:18.691 --> 01:02:21.215
and she wanted
nothing to do with it,

01:02:21.259 --> 01:02:24.392
or at least
she acted that way.

01:02:24.436 --> 01:02:26.568
She had texted him
to come over here.

01:02:26.612 --> 01:02:30.790
She had even composed
a love letter to him.

01:02:30.834 --> 01:02:33.575
That doesn'’t
make any sense.

01:02:33.619 --> 01:02:36.622
This whole thing, it
just doesn'’t make sense!

01:02:39.016 --> 01:02:40.278
I'’m sorry.

01:02:40.321 --> 01:02:41.627
I'’m sorry, I have to go.

01:02:41.670 --> 01:02:43.368
Yeah.

01:02:43.411 --> 01:02:47.938
When I'’m finished here, I'd like
to come by and talk some more.

01:02:47.981 --> 01:02:50.941
And your wife.

01:03:14.965 --> 01:03:18.229
You always know
how to kill a mood.

01:03:27.978 --> 01:03:30.458
Ashes to ashes...

01:03:30.502 --> 01:03:33.853
flush to flush.

01:03:33.897 --> 01:03:35.942
Bye daddy.

01:03:44.342 --> 01:03:47.649
Honey, the
detective'’s here.

01:03:49.390 --> 01:03:51.784
I'’ll be there
in a minute.

01:03:57.834 --> 01:04:00.314
Can I get
you something?

01:04:00.358 --> 01:04:01.968
I'’m fine, thanks.

01:04:15.895 --> 01:04:18.985
I appreciate you sitting
down with me like this.

01:04:19.029 --> 01:04:22.380
Whatever we
can do to help.

01:04:22.423 --> 01:04:25.383
Have either of you

01:04:25.426 --> 01:04:27.472
ever known them
to be violent?

01:04:27.515 --> 01:04:28.865
No.

01:04:28.908 --> 01:04:31.911
Nothing like this.

01:04:31.955 --> 01:04:32.999
Tell him.

01:04:33.043 --> 01:04:35.741
Tell me what?

01:04:37.351 --> 01:04:37.917
Scott was--

01:04:37.961 --> 01:04:39.440
Marci!

01:04:39.484 --> 01:04:41.442
Let her speak.

01:04:45.490 --> 01:04:48.928
Scott had an
incident last week.

01:04:48.972 --> 01:04:50.669
He beat up a woman
that we know.

01:04:50.712 --> 01:04:51.713
He denied it.

01:04:51.757 --> 01:04:53.411
Was this reported?

01:04:53.454 --> 01:04:56.022
No, she was
struggling with that

01:04:56.066 --> 01:04:57.763
after he came
and threatened her.

01:04:57.806 --> 01:04:59.939
So no, she did
not report it.

01:05:03.725 --> 01:05:06.990
All right, so
who is this she?

01:05:27.010 --> 01:05:30.056
We'’re here to help, so if
you have any more questions.

01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:32.145
I appreciate it.

01:05:32.189 --> 01:05:34.669
I'’ll just see
myself out.

01:05:41.154 --> 01:05:44.027
I can'’t believe
this is happening...

01:05:44.070 --> 01:05:45.811
Neither can I...

01:05:45.854 --> 01:05:48.031
I lost a best man and
you lost a best friend.

01:05:48.074 --> 01:05:50.990
Yeah, who was cheating
on me with my husband.

01:05:51.034 --> 01:05:53.601
We were not
having an affair!

01:05:53.645 --> 01:05:54.994
What do I have to
do to prove that?

01:05:55.038 --> 01:05:57.997
Yeah well, explain the
lipstick and the sheets.

01:05:58.041 --> 01:05:59.999
And the earring
and the panties.

01:06:00.043 --> 01:06:02.697
Maybe it was a joke or
they were pranking us?

01:06:02.741 --> 01:06:06.571
If it was a stupid prank,
she would have told me

01:06:06.614 --> 01:06:10.140
when I went to confront her...

01:06:10.183 --> 01:06:13.534
You'’re right.

01:06:13.578 --> 01:06:17.974
I just don'’t want to
go through this alone.

01:06:18.017 --> 01:06:20.585
I promise you this...

01:06:23.849 --> 01:06:27.026
We can get through this,
we can clear up this up.

01:06:27.070 --> 01:06:30.203
Together.

01:06:30.247 --> 01:06:34.903
Just let me be with you.

01:06:34.947 --> 01:06:37.645
I love you.

01:07:22.212 --> 01:07:23.691
Good morning.

01:07:23.735 --> 01:07:24.736
Good morning.

01:07:24.779 --> 01:07:26.085
You'’re Jenna Kravitz?

01:07:26.129 --> 01:07:27.478
Yeah.

01:07:27.521 --> 01:07:29.088
Detective Moreno.

01:07:29.132 --> 01:07:30.655
Everything alright?

01:07:30.698 --> 01:07:33.527
Yeah, yeah, I was just
rushing to answer the door.

01:07:33.571 --> 01:07:34.876
Ah.

01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:38.141
Well, I'’m here to talk
about Scott Harrison.

01:07:38.184 --> 01:07:39.664
Mind if I come in?

01:07:39.707 --> 01:07:40.882
Oh yeah!

01:07:40.926 --> 01:07:42.884
Thank you.

01:07:47.672 --> 01:07:49.717
Thank you for coming out
here today, Detective,

01:07:49.761 --> 01:07:53.547
but I'’m not
filing a report.

01:07:53.591 --> 01:07:56.246
So something happened
between you and Mr. Harrison?

01:07:56.289 --> 01:07:59.118
I'’d rather not
talk about it.

01:08:00.250 --> 01:08:05.124
Security footage in front of his
place shows you crying for help.

01:08:05.168 --> 01:08:07.474
Look, I don'’t care
whether you file or not,

01:08:07.518 --> 01:08:12.044
I just need to
know what happened.

01:08:12.088 --> 01:08:16.265
He made an inappropriate
advance and when I said no,

01:08:16.309 --> 01:08:20.095
he went into a
rage and attacked me.

01:08:20.139 --> 01:08:21.836
I think he was
frustrated about

01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:24.622
what happened
earlier in the day.

01:08:24.665 --> 01:08:26.885
What was that?

01:08:26.928 --> 01:08:30.193
This woman, Chelsea, had
rejected him at her party

01:08:30.236 --> 01:08:32.716
and I don'’t think it
was the first time.

01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:35.023
Maybe mine was one
too many for him.

01:08:35.067 --> 01:08:38.201
So he took it out on me.

01:08:50.865 --> 01:08:54.826
So Scott and this Chelsea,
they have a history?

01:08:54.868 --> 01:08:56.828
Oh yes!

01:08:56.871 --> 01:08:58.656
I haven'’t been
friends with them long,

01:08:58.698 --> 01:09:00.962
but they seem to have
this weird game going on.

01:09:01.006 --> 01:09:02.877
I think she really
enjoys toying with him.

01:09:02.921 --> 01:09:06.751
I don'’t think she realizes
how much it drives him crazy.

01:09:06.794 --> 01:09:10.581
So you haven'’t heard?

01:09:10.624 --> 01:09:12.191
Heard what?

01:09:12.234 --> 01:09:15.151
I'’ve been stuck in here
the last few days working.

01:09:25.073 --> 01:09:27.075
I think that went
well, don'’t you?

01:09:27.118 --> 01:09:30.862
Despite the fact that you
were being such a snoop!

01:10:01.893 --> 01:10:03.155
How you doing?

01:10:03.199 --> 01:10:04.200
I'’m good...

01:10:07.725 --> 01:10:11.642
Is this some sort of joke?

01:10:11.685 --> 01:10:15.080
What are you doing here?

01:10:18.736 --> 01:10:19.998
No! No! No!

01:10:41.019 --> 01:10:41.933
Hey.

01:10:41.976 --> 01:10:43.891
I'’m sorry to bother you.

01:10:43.935 --> 01:10:46.764
No, it'’s no bother.

01:10:46.807 --> 01:10:48.461
I'’m assuming you
talked to the police?

01:10:48.505 --> 01:10:50.071
Yes.

01:10:50.115 --> 01:10:51.943
Listen, I'’m sorry but...

01:10:51.986 --> 01:10:55.773
I had to say
something because,

01:10:55.816 --> 01:10:57.992
well, two people
are dead...

01:10:58.036 --> 01:10:59.907
No, it'’s okay.

01:10:59.951 --> 01:11:01.300
I would have done
the same thing.

01:11:01.344 --> 01:11:04.216
Frankly, I'’m more
worried about you.

01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:06.436
I mean, Chelsea was
your best friend.

01:11:06.479 --> 01:11:08.394
I'’m still trying to
make sense of it all.

01:11:08.438 --> 01:11:09.787
Nothing makes sense to me.

01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:11.484
Me neither.

01:11:11.528 --> 01:11:14.313
And I don'’t know about you, but
I keep having these nightmares.

01:11:14.357 --> 01:11:17.447
I keep thinking about Scott
and how that could'’ve been me.

01:11:17.490 --> 01:11:19.318
You know, he
could'’ve killed me.

01:11:19.362 --> 01:11:21.364
Listen Jenna, he'’s gone.

01:11:21.407 --> 01:11:23.235
He'’s not gonna
hurt you again, okay?

01:11:23.279 --> 01:11:26.412
I just wish these
feelings would go away.

01:11:26.456 --> 01:11:28.066
Do you want me
to come over?

01:11:28.109 --> 01:11:30.286
It would do me
some good to get out.

01:11:30.329 --> 01:11:32.288
As long as it
doesn'’t cause any trouble.

01:11:32.331 --> 01:11:33.811
Trouble?

01:11:33.854 --> 01:11:35.813
Yeah, for you and Glenn.

01:11:35.856 --> 01:11:38.163
I know he'’s mad at me
about what I said about Scott.

01:11:38.206 --> 01:11:39.338
No, don'’t worry
about him.

01:11:39.382 --> 01:11:40.861
This will just be
between you and I.

01:11:40.905 --> 01:11:42.863
He'’s got enough
on his mind.

01:11:42.907 --> 01:11:43.864
Good.

01:11:43.908 --> 01:11:46.345
Oh, and before I forget,

01:11:46.389 --> 01:11:48.304
why don'’t you bring
your wedding dress?

01:11:48.347 --> 01:11:49.609
My wedding dress?

01:11:49.653 --> 01:11:51.524
Yeah, it'’s for the
preservation process.

01:11:51.568 --> 01:11:53.221
It'’s part of the package.

01:11:53.265 --> 01:11:55.049
Auntie told me
to remind you...

01:11:55.093 --> 01:11:57.835
Right, okay sure.

01:11:57.878 --> 01:11:59.445
See you soon.

01:11:59.489 --> 01:12:01.229
Okay, bye.

01:12:11.544 --> 01:12:14.155
Let me take that.

01:12:14.199 --> 01:12:16.462
I'’ve set us up in here.

01:12:23.513 --> 01:12:24.905
Is your aunt around?

01:12:24.949 --> 01:12:26.167
I would like to thank her.

01:12:26.211 --> 01:12:27.430
Oh, she'’s out.

01:12:27.473 --> 01:12:29.562
Her weekly bridge game.

01:12:29.606 --> 01:12:31.303
A friend comes
and picks her up.

01:12:31.347 --> 01:12:32.304
Oh.

01:12:32.348 --> 01:12:33.479
Yeah... tea?

01:12:33.523 --> 01:12:35.351
Tea is fine.

01:12:40.181 --> 01:12:41.574
It'’s a beautiful set.

01:12:41.618 --> 01:12:44.272
It'’s Auntie's.
Like everything.

01:12:54.152 --> 01:12:56.546
So, how'’s
Glenn doing?

01:12:59.026 --> 01:13:02.160
As good as anyone can in
this situation, I guess.

01:13:02.203 --> 01:13:04.205
And you?

01:13:05.206 --> 01:13:06.469
Not as well.

01:13:08.906 --> 01:13:12.388
You know, I must admit
I was a bit surprised

01:13:12.431 --> 01:13:14.390
that he moved
back in with you

01:13:14.433 --> 01:13:17.044
after our conversation
the other day.

01:13:17.088 --> 01:13:19.046
How did you
know about that?

01:13:19.090 --> 01:13:23.007
Uh, you mentioned it
on the phone earlier.

01:13:23.050 --> 01:13:25.313
I did?

01:13:27.533 --> 01:13:30.188
My head has just
been really twisted.

01:13:33.104 --> 01:13:35.193
So how are you
and Glenn doing?

01:13:35.236 --> 01:13:37.282
Well, he'’s swears that
nothing is going on,

01:13:37.325 --> 01:13:40.372
so I'’m starting
to believe him.

01:13:40.416 --> 01:13:43.506
And given the fact that Scott
and Chelsea were found together,

01:13:43.549 --> 01:13:45.595
there has to be another
explanation, right?

01:13:45.638 --> 01:13:49.468
Maybe she was sleeping
with both of them?

01:13:49.512 --> 01:13:52.253
I don'’t think so...

01:13:52.297 --> 01:13:55.256
Your best friend dies and
you just give him a free pass?

01:13:55.300 --> 01:13:58.912
I'’m not giving
him a free pass.

01:14:02.133 --> 01:14:04.352
Can I just be honest?

01:14:04.396 --> 01:14:06.354
That is
completely misguided.

01:14:06.398 --> 01:14:08.139
You can'’t let him back in,

01:14:08.182 --> 01:14:11.142
or you'’ll lose 20 years
just like your poor mama.

01:14:11.185 --> 01:14:14.406
Thank you for
your concern.

01:14:14.450 --> 01:14:18.497
I thought this visit was
about you and your fears?

01:14:18.541 --> 01:14:21.500
Oh, yes.

01:14:21.544 --> 01:14:24.503
Thank you so much.

01:14:28.246 --> 01:14:30.422
What? What'’s wrong?

01:14:31.423 --> 01:14:33.381
Nothing.

01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:44.392
Your perfume?

01:14:44.436 --> 01:14:47.395
It'’s very distinctive.

01:14:47.439 --> 01:14:49.006
What is it?

01:14:49.049 --> 01:14:52.400
Sue-nelle.
I'’ve used it for years.

01:14:52.444 --> 01:14:55.316
Oh...

01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:58.232
Thank you very much for
the tea, that was lovely

01:14:58.276 --> 01:15:00.626
but I have to go.

01:15:00.670 --> 01:15:02.454
You'’re leaving?

01:15:02.498 --> 01:15:04.238
But I'’m not done talking.

01:15:04.282 --> 01:15:05.631
I haven'’t told you
about all my problems.

01:15:05.675 --> 01:15:07.677
I know, there'’s
just some...

01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:10.027
some arrangements
that I have to make.

01:15:10.070 --> 01:15:11.550
Well you can'’t leave.

01:15:11.594 --> 01:15:16.207
I'’m not done talking and
you'’re being quite rude.

01:15:16.250 --> 01:15:19.123
I have to go...

01:15:19.166 --> 01:15:22.474
So you can ruin
everything?

01:15:22.518 --> 01:15:24.171
What are you
talking about?

01:15:24.215 --> 01:15:27.697
You were never good
enough for Glenn...

01:15:29.394 --> 01:15:30.961
It was you...

01:15:31.004 --> 01:15:34.573
Shhh, just go to sleep.

01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:41.014
Good girl.

01:16:37.723 --> 01:16:40.204
Oh, look!

01:16:40.247 --> 01:16:42.423
It'’s your lover.

01:16:42.467 --> 01:16:44.730
That'’s okay...

01:16:44.774 --> 01:16:46.471
he'’s mine!

01:16:52.172 --> 01:16:53.783
Leave a message!

01:16:53.826 --> 01:16:56.350
Call me as soon
as you get this.

01:17:28.339 --> 01:17:30.471
No, it'’s not ready!

01:18:33.796 --> 01:18:35.798
Marci?

01:18:35.841 --> 01:18:37.190
Glenn?

01:18:37.234 --> 01:18:38.496
I'’m here!
I'’m here!

01:18:38.539 --> 01:18:40.803
I'm here, I'’m gonna
get you out!

01:18:43.936 --> 01:18:45.764
It'’ll be okay, Glenn.

01:18:45.808 --> 01:18:48.462
It'’ll be okay.

01:18:52.423 --> 01:18:56.514
Looks like somebody needs
some more of Auntie'’s medicine.

01:18:56.557 --> 01:18:58.516
Oh don'’t worry,
he'’ll be alright.

01:18:58.559 --> 01:19:03.390
I'’ll make sure he gets
a happily ever after.

01:19:03.434 --> 01:19:04.740
Bye-bye.

01:19:49.001 --> 01:19:51.482
Okay, come on.

01:20:00.621 --> 01:20:01.971
Bye-bye, Marci.

01:20:33.959 --> 01:20:35.918
Marci?

01:20:38.616 --> 01:20:40.661
What the hell?

01:20:41.706 --> 01:20:43.403
Oh good, you'’re
finally getting up.

01:20:43.447 --> 01:20:45.884
We have a big
night ahead.

01:20:45.928 --> 01:20:47.755
Where'’s Marci?

01:20:47.799 --> 01:20:49.061
What did you do to her?

01:20:49.105 --> 01:20:51.411
Sadly, she'’s gone.

01:20:51.455 --> 01:20:52.978
What?

01:20:53.022 --> 01:20:55.067
The loss of her best friend and
the inability to reconcile

01:20:55.111 --> 01:20:58.592
with her estranged husband
led her to take her own life.

01:21:32.583 --> 01:21:34.585
Please somebody help me!

01:21:34.628 --> 01:21:36.456
Anybody, help!

01:21:36.500 --> 01:21:37.718
It'’s just us.

01:21:37.762 --> 01:21:39.503
Nobody can hear
you way out here.

01:21:39.546 --> 01:21:44.029
But don'’t worry, I've
taken care of everything.

01:21:44.073 --> 01:21:46.162
Just like we planned.

01:21:46.205 --> 01:21:48.033
I didn'’t plan
anything with you.

01:21:48.077 --> 01:21:50.122
Of course you did.

01:21:50.166 --> 01:21:54.474
You think I could'’ve put
all this together on my own?

01:22:00.611 --> 01:22:02.526
I love you.

01:22:02.569 --> 01:22:05.572
I want you
to be my first.

01:22:05.616 --> 01:22:11.448
I want to be your wife and I
know you want to be my husband.

01:22:11.491 --> 01:22:14.930
You'’re crazy.

01:22:14.973 --> 01:22:17.845
Why do men always say that?

01:22:17.889 --> 01:22:20.805
Men always demand so much
and then when you show them

01:22:20.848 --> 01:22:23.982
just how much you love
them, they call you crazy!

01:22:24.026 --> 01:22:26.811
I don'’t know how you could think
I would agree to all of this--

01:22:26.854 --> 01:22:28.421
Because you love me!

01:22:28.465 --> 01:22:30.815
You told me how much you want
us to live a life together.

01:22:30.858 --> 01:22:32.817
Okay?

01:22:32.860 --> 01:22:34.123
Just wait.

01:22:34.166 --> 01:22:35.994
I'’ll be back in jiff!

01:22:50.052 --> 01:22:51.705
Oh, stop!

01:22:51.749 --> 01:22:53.620
Stop!

01:22:53.664 --> 01:22:55.666
Stop, you gotta stop!

01:22:56.275 --> 01:22:57.973
Geez, are you okay?

01:22:58.016 --> 01:22:59.583
You gotta take me
down this hill.

01:22:59.626 --> 01:23:02.586
I gotta call the police,
my husband'’s in trouble.

01:23:02.629 --> 01:23:04.240
Just down this hill.

01:23:06.068 --> 01:23:08.853
I hope you'’re ready for me!

01:23:11.203 --> 01:23:19.429
♪ Wedding March

01:23:19.472 --> 01:23:20.604
This is insane!

01:23:20.647 --> 01:23:23.172
Shhh... it'’s starting.

01:23:23.215 --> 01:23:24.912
We do.

01:23:24.956 --> 01:23:26.566
Can we please stop this?

01:23:26.610 --> 01:23:28.133
It'’s okay to be nervous.

01:23:28.177 --> 01:23:30.657
Everybody gets nervous.
It'’s just pre-wedding jitters.

01:23:30.701 --> 01:23:32.050
This isn'’t jitters!
I don'’t want this!

01:23:32.094 --> 01:23:33.921
But you said that you loved me.

01:23:33.965 --> 01:23:35.749
I never said that!

01:23:35.793 --> 01:23:37.229
I love Marci.

01:23:37.273 --> 01:23:39.101
Don'’t say her name.

01:23:39.144 --> 01:23:40.667
I could never love
someone like you!

01:23:40.711 --> 01:23:41.886
Don'’t say such things!

01:23:41.929 --> 01:23:43.627
Marci is my wife!

01:23:43.670 --> 01:23:46.021
Stop! Stop!

01:23:46.064 --> 01:23:48.501
Not you, not some
pathetic dressmaker!

01:24:09.957 --> 01:24:11.133
Easy.

01:24:11.176 --> 01:24:13.004
I thought you
were different.

01:24:13.048 --> 01:24:15.006
I thought things
would be different.

01:24:15.050 --> 01:24:17.052
But you'’re
ruining everything!

01:24:17.095 --> 01:24:18.879
I didn'’t mean to, okay?

01:24:18.923 --> 01:24:20.968
You just need some help.

01:24:21.012 --> 01:24:22.535
I need you.

01:24:22.579 --> 01:24:24.798
I love you.

01:24:24.842 --> 01:24:29.238
But you tied me up, you'’re
forcing me to marry you.

01:24:29.281 --> 01:24:31.849
Do you know what it'’s like
to know that there'’s someone

01:24:31.892 --> 01:24:35.070
out there you love but
doesn'’t love you back?

01:24:35.113 --> 01:24:36.854
I can'’t live that way.

01:24:43.208 --> 01:24:44.731
We can talk about this.

01:24:44.775 --> 01:24:46.211
But you made your choice.

01:24:46.255 --> 01:24:47.995
In fact, you made
it quite clear.

01:24:48.039 --> 01:24:49.606
Just calm down, okay?

01:24:49.649 --> 01:24:50.911
Maybe I can learn
to love you.

01:24:50.955 --> 01:24:52.565
That'’s not love!

01:24:52.609 --> 01:24:54.132
I'’m sorry, Glenn.

01:24:54.176 --> 01:24:56.700
It'’s just the way
it has to be.

01:24:56.743 --> 01:24:58.919
No, please!

01:25:04.621 --> 01:25:06.579
If you say anything...

01:25:09.713 --> 01:25:11.193
Okay?

01:25:23.770 --> 01:25:25.598
What do you want?

01:25:29.907 --> 01:25:31.256
What do you want?

01:25:38.307 --> 01:25:39.830
Marci?

01:25:41.223 --> 01:25:42.615
She'’s coming.

01:25:45.662 --> 01:25:46.967
Get out of here!

01:25:50.145 --> 01:25:51.276
It'’s okay.

01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:53.757
We'’re alone now,
it'’s just us.

01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:55.280
Now, where were we?

01:25:58.892 --> 01:26:00.807
Where is she?

01:26:00.851 --> 01:26:02.200
I don'’t know what
you'’re talking about.

01:26:02.244 --> 01:26:04.115
Maybe this will
draw her out.

01:26:09.773 --> 01:26:11.122
It'’s over.

01:26:11.166 --> 01:26:12.906
I'’ve called the police,
they'’re on their way.

01:26:12.950 --> 01:26:15.996
Auntie said it'’d never
happen, but it did.

01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:17.998
I'’ve had my
great love story.

01:26:18.042 --> 01:26:20.827
What're you talking about?
He never loved you!

01:26:20.871 --> 01:26:23.221
For a little
while, he did.

01:26:23.265 --> 01:26:25.832
And you can never take
that away from me...

01:26:51.162 --> 01:26:52.163
Marci!

01:27:00.998 --> 01:27:02.869
Where is she?

01:27:07.091 --> 01:27:08.179
She was right here!

01:27:08.223 --> 01:27:09.136
Glenn...

01:27:09.180 --> 01:27:10.355
Come on, we'’ve gotta get out.

01:27:10.399 --> 01:27:11.356
Oh my god...

01:27:39.428 --> 01:27:41.256
How are you
feeling, honey?

01:27:41.299 --> 01:27:43.649
Just happy to be home.

01:27:45.216 --> 01:27:46.435
You know, after
we got married,

01:27:46.478 --> 01:27:48.828
I never carried you
across the threshold.

01:27:48.872 --> 01:27:50.134
Really?

01:27:55.182 --> 01:27:57.228
You know, ancient
cultures believed

01:27:57.272 --> 01:27:59.970
it would prevent bad
luck and evil spirits.

01:28:00.013 --> 01:28:02.102
Oh really?

01:28:02.146 --> 01:28:04.975
Well I guess
we'’d better do it.

01:28:18.118 --> 01:28:21.034
Yeah, you'’ve gotta
turn and look at her.

01:28:21.470 --> 01:28:24.386
Yeah, ugh.

01:28:24.429 --> 01:28:27.258
Karen, I need the fifty mil.

01:28:27.302 --> 01:28:31.131
Karen, snap out of it.
I need the fifty mil.

01:28:34.221 --> 01:28:36.223
All right, let'’s go again.

01:28:36.267 --> 01:28:38.443
Lots and lots of love now.

01:28:40.227 --> 01:28:42.317
Like that!
