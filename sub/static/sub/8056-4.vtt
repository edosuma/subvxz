00:01.204 --> 00:02.471
Gentlemen.

00:02.604 --> 00:04.971
Wildeness weekend is upon us.

00:05.804 --> 00:07.171
There will be no video games.

00:07.205 --> 00:09.540
There will be
no Internet pads.

00:09.574 --> 00:11.692
This weekend
you have two parents:

00:11.726 --> 00:14.411
Me and Mother Nature.

00:14.446 --> 00:16.146
And I...

00:16.181 --> 00:18.582
am Mother Nature's brother:

00:18.616 --> 00:19.566
Brother nature.

00:19.617 --> 00:21.018
But you can call me Andy.

00:21.052 --> 00:23.220
Or brother nature.

00:23.254 --> 00:24.254
Your call.

00:24.554 --> 00:26.187
- Thank you, Andy.
- Brother nature.

00:26.354 --> 00:27.887
For the last three years

00:28.051 --> 00:31.319
I have served as troop leader
of the Pawnee Rangers.

00:31.353 --> 00:33.354
This is our handbook.

00:35.357 --> 00:37.492
I wrote the whole thing myself.

00:37.526 --> 00:39.194
Okay, it's time
to give out the badges.

00:39.212 --> 00:40.479
Um, let's see.

00:40.513 --> 00:42.697
Emily, you get the badge
for most community service.

00:43.883 --> 00:47.169
To Casey,
the best penguin blog badge.

00:48.237 --> 00:49.204
To Abigail,

00:49.238 --> 00:51.223
flyest hairstyle.

00:51.257 --> 00:53.592
And Ann gets the badge
for second-flyest hairstyle.

00:53.643 --> 00:55.393
Oh!
I wasn't competing for that.

00:55.428 --> 00:56.511
I'll say.

00:56.546 --> 00:57.896
Five years ago,

00:57.930 --> 01:00.715
a plucky fifth-grader wanted
to join the Pawnee Rangers,

01:00.750 --> 01:03.585
but their executive council said
what obnoxious jerks always say.

01:03.619 --> 01:05.352
"No. This is males-only.

01:05.387 --> 01:06.688
Go start your own club."

01:06.722 --> 01:08.390
She couldn't.

01:08.424 --> 01:10.242
So I did.

01:10.276 --> 01:11.559
We're called
the Pawnee Goddesses,

01:11.577 --> 01:14.029
and we're freakin' awesome.

01:14.063 --> 01:16.064
Hey, Ron, whose club
do you think is better,

01:16.099 --> 01:17.398
yours or mine?

01:17.416 --> 01:19.000
The answer is mine.
Say mine is better.

01:19.035 --> 01:20.435
It's not a competition.

01:20.470 --> 01:22.070
Oh, but it is.

01:22.105 --> 01:24.206
Your club made it a competition
when they kept girls out.

01:24.240 --> 01:26.108
Oh, my stars.

01:26.142 --> 01:27.575
I'm just a little lady.

01:27.593 --> 01:31.012
My fragile constitution cannot
handle the fearsome outdoors.

01:31.047 --> 01:33.281
I have no problem
with strong women, Leslie.

01:33.316 --> 01:34.916
Who's Leslie?

01:34.934 --> 01:37.385
My name is Annabelle Vandergraf,

01:37.419 --> 01:39.254
and, y'all,

01:39.288 --> 01:40.438
I just fall to pieces

01:40.473 --> 01:42.257
when the sun shines

01:42.275 --> 01:44.359
on my hair--ed.

01:44.393 --> 01:48.029
However, the Pawnee Rangers
were founded because some boys

01:48.064 --> 01:50.198
want to go out into nature

01:50.233 --> 01:52.267
and learn
traditional survival skills

01:52.301 --> 01:54.136
without being distracted
by girls.

01:54.170 --> 01:58.039
Well, my awesome goddesses
don't want to be distracted by losers.

01:58.074 --> 01:59.540
Say my club is better, Ron.

01:59.575 --> 02:00.308
Say it.

02:00.343 --> 02:01.293
My club is better.

02:01.327 --> 02:02.460
Say it.

02:02.495 --> 02:04.045
Come on. Say it's better.

02:04.080 --> 02:05.163
Say it.

02:05.214 --> 02:06.381
Say it's better.
Say my club is better.

02:06.415 --> 02:07.382
Say it. Give it up.

02:07.416 --> 02:08.383
Whose club is better? Mine.

02:08.417 --> 02:09.383
Say it. You know it.

02:09.418 --> 02:11.119
Say it.

02:11.154 --> 02:12.387
On principal,
I never say anything

02:12.421 --> 02:15.423
that another person is obviously
trying to get me to say.

02:15.458 --> 02:17.659
My first wedding ceremony
took two hours,

02:17.693 --> 02:21.129
because after the priest said
"Repeat after me"

02:21.164 --> 02:24.065
I fell silent.

Nothing is wrong,
just do your job.

03:10.446 --> 03:13.615
And they would
never cancel <i>Game of Thrones.</i>

03:13.649 --> 03:14.716
It's a crossover hit.

two gifts.

Go ahead. Open 'em.

03:55.424 --> 03:56.391
What is this?

03:56.409 --> 03:58.443
That is a canvas sheet,

03:58.494 --> 04:01.246
the most versatile object
known to man.

04:01.280 --> 04:03.598
It can be used
to make tents, backpacks,

04:03.633 --> 04:05.100
shoes, stretchers,

04:05.134 --> 04:06.501
sails, tarpaulins,

04:06.519 --> 04:09.554
and I suppose, in the most
dire of circumstances,

04:09.605 --> 04:12.207
it can be a surface
on which to make

04:12.241 --> 04:13.191
"art."

04:13.225 --> 04:14.476
What's the second gift?

04:14.510 --> 04:17.345
The second gift
is the box itself.

04:17.363 --> 04:20.214
You have 10 minutes
to assemble a shelter

04:20.249 --> 04:22.984

loosely structured craft time?

some cornhusk dolls for everyone

I like you, Mr. Swanson,
it's just...

08:53.288 --> 08:55.272
All we do is sit in silence
and eat beans.

08:55.323 --> 08:58.192
Those beans were a reward.

08:58.226 --> 08:59.193
Well, see, the thing is

08:59.227 --> 09:00.527
this club is for girls only.

09:00.561 --> 09:02.863
Maybe you should start
your own club, for boys.

09:02.897 --> 09:03.931
Get back to your canvas box.

09:03.965 --> 09:06.083
We'll discuss this no further.

09:06.117 --> 09:08.035
And I'll thank you
to keep the ruckus down

09:08.069 --> 09:10.570
so my boys can
focus on solitude.

09:10.588 --> 09:12.406
- I'm sorry, Darren.
- Let's go.

09:15.110 --> 09:17.261
So, treat yourself day
is just a day

09:17.295 --> 09:20.464
where you go to the spa
and then the mall?

09:21.683 --> 09:22.983
I knew you wouldn't get it.

09:23.018 --> 09:25.386
Well, I'm a relaxation novice.

09:25.420 --> 09:26.387
Give me some guidance.

09:26.421 --> 09:28.188
Listen to me, Ben-to box,

09:28.223 --> 09:30.224
the point of this
is to pamper yourself.

09:30.258 --> 09:32.493
Just relaaax, man.

09:32.527 --> 09:33.527
I can't.

09:33.561 --> 09:35.262
Something about
the sound of harps

09:35.280 --> 09:37.898
that makes me nervous.

09:37.932 --> 09:39.233
Oh, my God!

09:39.267 --> 09:40.651
- Hi, Donna.
- Hey.

09:40.702 --> 09:42.636
Relaxation lesson number one:

09:42.671 --> 09:44.304
Acupuncture.

09:44.339 --> 09:46.640
It's great for your back,
and your rear.

09:46.675 --> 09:49.476
Needles in your face,
pleasure in your base.

09:52.881 --> 09:54.648
- I know.
- That's my boss.

09:54.666 --> 09:56.316
Hey, Chris.

09:56.351 --> 09:59.586
Uh, I would like you
to meet my daughter, Millicent.

09:59.621 --> 10:01.338
Wow.

10:01.372 --> 10:02.489
Jerry, great job.

10:02.523 --> 10:03.857
I'm your dad's boss.

10:03.892 --> 10:05.792
And his much-younger friend.

10:05.827 --> 10:07.227
Pleasure to meet you.

10:07.262 --> 10:08.378
Isn't she beautiful?

10:08.429 --> 10:11.164
I say she looks
like my wife, Gayle,

10:11.182 --> 10:13.267
and Gayle agrees.

10:13.301 --> 10:15.435
So, anyway,
we were gonna go to lunch, so--

10:15.470 --> 10:18.338
I retroactively accept
your original offer.

10:18.873 --> 10:19.556
Let's go!

10:19.557 --> 10:20.857
Ladies, I just wanted

10:20.892 --> 10:23.644
to thank you for not cheering
when I sent Darren away.

10:23.678 --> 10:25.979
Ms. Knope,
wasn't Darren just asking

10:26.014 --> 10:27.547
for the same equality
that you and the goddesses

10:27.582 --> 10:30.584
wanted five years ago?

10:30.618 --> 10:31.818
In a sense,

10:31.852 --> 10:33.453
but it's a little bit
more complicated than--

10:33.488 --> 10:34.988
Wasn't your answer
the very same thing

10:35.023 --> 10:37.291
that the ranger council
said to you?

10:37.325 --> 10:38.292
"Stick to your own kind"?

10:38.326 --> 10:40.711
Who wants
homemade peanut brittle?

10:40.745 --> 10:43.597
Ms. Perkins, please,
we're in the middle of a debate.

10:43.631 --> 10:45.198
Sorry.

10:45.216 --> 10:46.333
Come on, goddesses.

10:46.367 --> 10:48.368
We just struck
a huge blow for equality

10:48.386 --> 10:50.037
by proving that
we were better than them.

10:50.071 --> 10:51.071
I disagree.

10:51.105 --> 10:52.639
What about a public forum?

10:52.674 --> 10:54.474
You always say that
there's no better solution

10:54.509 --> 10:55.759
for a hot-button issue

10:55.810 --> 10:58.228
than a good ol'-fashioned
public forum.

10:58.262 --> 10:59.229
Great idea, Lauren.

10:59.263 --> 11:00.547
What was that?

11:00.565 --> 11:03.183
I said,
"great idea, Lauren."

11:03.217 --> 11:04.601
I've taught them too well.

11:04.652 --> 11:07.821
I've created a mob of
little Leslie Knope monsters.

11:07.855 --> 11:09.089
I'm so proud.

11:09.123 --> 11:10.157
And a little annoyed.

11:10.191 --> 11:11.908
But mostly proud.

11:11.943 --> 11:13.243
70/30.

11:13.277 --> 11:15.245
Just relax and don't move.

11:15.279 --> 11:17.264
Okay. Ah...

11:17.298 --> 11:19.433
This is the most

11:19.467 --> 11:22.369
stressed-out I've ever been

11:22.403 --> 11:23.470
in my life.

11:23.504 --> 11:24.955
Ben, listen.

11:25.006 --> 11:26.807
I'm gonna talk to you
about things you like

11:26.841 --> 11:28.008
to take your mind
off the needles, okay?

11:29.043 --> 11:31.578
Accounting.

11:31.596 --> 11:32.779
Trigonometry.

11:32.814 --> 11:33.914
Stamps, probably.

11:33.948 --> 11:35.148
More of a rare coins guy.

11:35.183 --> 11:36.616
Help me. Help me!

11:36.651 --> 11:40.320
There is nothing that I like
more than running for charity.

11:40.355 --> 11:42.639
You know, last summer
I did a 50-mile bike ride

11:42.690 --> 11:44.591
- for the red cross.
- Yes, she did.

11:44.609 --> 11:45.925
Millicent Gergich,

11:45.943 --> 11:48.061
biking for charity is <i>literally</i>

11:48.095 --> 11:49.646
one of my interests on Facebook.

11:50.732 --> 11:52.783
I can't believe
how alike we are.

11:52.817 --> 11:55.235
I know, it's like
we're literally the same person.

11:58.156 --> 12:01.241
We are having a moment.

12:02.443 --> 12:03.710
Attention, everyone.

12:03.745 --> 12:05.812
Welcome to wonder weekend's

12:05.847 --> 12:08.331
first-ever public forum.

12:08.383 --> 12:10.000
Our topic today?

12:10.051 --> 12:11.418
Should the amazing goddesses

12:11.452 --> 12:14.688
take pity on the once-powerful
Pawnee Rangers,

12:14.722 --> 12:18.392
and let them into our
clearly superior organization?

12:18.426 --> 12:20.427
Ron, your opening statement.

12:22.997 --> 12:24.514
This forum,
like all public forums,

12:24.565 --> 12:25.599
is a waste of time.

12:25.633 --> 12:27.034
Thank you.

12:27.068 --> 12:28.235
Powerful stuff.

12:28.269 --> 12:30.854
Okay. Let's open up
the floor to debate.

12:30.905 --> 12:32.322
Who-- yes, Abigail.

12:32.356 --> 12:35.475
Isn't it like <i>Brown vs.
The Board of Education?</i>

12:35.493 --> 12:37.577
Separate but equal
is never really equal.

12:37.612 --> 12:38.712
We should let the boys in.

12:38.746 --> 12:40.363
Mmm, interesting. Casey?

12:40.415 --> 12:41.665
I disagree.

12:41.699 --> 12:44.251
I think there's a benefit
to educating the genders separately.

12:44.285 --> 12:46.253
I see where
you're coming from.

12:46.287 --> 12:47.821
Let's hear from a ranger.

12:47.839 --> 12:49.923
Anyone? Darren?

12:49.957 --> 12:52.392
It's cold
and dirty out here.

12:52.427 --> 12:54.561
And you guys have candy.

12:54.595 --> 12:56.046
I want the candy.

12:56.597 --> 12:58.899
The goddesses are making
some well-informed statements,

12:58.933 --> 13:00.434
but the most compelling point

13:00.468 --> 13:02.469
is from Darren, about the candy.

13:02.503 --> 13:05.172
We have amazing candy in there.

13:05.706 --> 13:07.207
Welcome to Nirvana,

13:07.241 --> 13:08.975
the Plaza at Eagleton.

13:09.009 --> 13:10.544
There's a reflecting pool
out back,

13:10.578 --> 13:12.779
there's an old-timey train
that runs through the mall,

13:12.814 --> 13:15.048
and three Burberrys.

13:15.083 --> 13:16.817
If you tell your friend,
"hey, meet me at Burberry,"

13:16.851 --> 13:19.453
they gotta specify which one.

13:19.487 --> 13:20.821
Let's hit it.

13:22.206 --> 13:23.189
I really want this dress,

13:23.207 --> 13:25.025
and I like this crystal beetle,

13:25.059 --> 13:28.545
but it's expensive
and there's no use for it.

13:28.579 --> 13:30.030
Donna Meagle?

13:30.064 --> 13:31.898
Treat yourself.

13:31.933 --> 13:34.134
Velvet slippies,
cashmere socks,

13:34.168 --> 13:36.219
velvet pants,
cashmere turtle.

13:36.254 --> 13:38.004
I'm a cashmere-velvet
candy cane.

13:38.039 --> 13:40.540
Treat yourself.

13:40.575 --> 13:42.109
I mean, this is insane.

13:43.394 --> 13:44.978
Jerry, a word?

13:45.012 --> 13:46.079
Of course.

13:46.114 --> 13:48.315
I had an amazing lunch.

13:48.349 --> 13:50.600
I've already passed
the kale salad I had.

13:50.651 --> 13:51.651
But, even better?

13:51.686 --> 13:53.570
Your daughter
was delightful company.

13:53.604 --> 13:55.272
Now, I don't want to put you

13:55.323 --> 13:56.907
in an awkward position, but--

13:56.941 --> 13:58.692
You would like
to date my daughter.

13:58.726 --> 13:59.893
Yes!
But you are her father.

13:59.911 --> 14:01.661
And that is a sacred thing.

14:01.696 --> 14:03.864
I would like to spend
the next 2 to 4 days with you

14:03.898 --> 14:05.231
so you can get
to know me better,

14:05.249 --> 14:06.700
to find out if I'm
the kind of person

14:06.734 --> 14:08.418
who's good enough
for your daughter.

14:08.452 --> 14:09.836
Then, you can come with us

14:09.871 --> 14:11.204
on our first 3 to 6 dates--

14:11.238 --> 14:12.205
Chris,
I appreciate the gesture,

14:12.240 --> 14:13.740
it's very nice,

14:13.758 --> 14:15.342
but, Milly,
she's a grown woman,

14:15.376 --> 14:16.877
and of course I trust her.

14:16.911 --> 14:18.678
And I trust you.

14:18.713 --> 14:19.980
Jerry.

14:20.014 --> 14:21.014
Thank you.

14:26.187 --> 14:27.354
Mmm.

14:27.388 --> 14:28.922
Boys, I'm trying
to teach you something

14:28.940 --> 14:32.425
about nature and self-reliance.

14:32.460 --> 14:35.028
Nothing beats hard work
and determination.

14:35.062 --> 14:36.530
Is this
the Pawnee goddesses?

14:36.564 --> 14:37.531
I've got
the puppies you ordered.

14:37.565 --> 14:38.532
Oh!

14:38.566 --> 14:40.200
The puppies
for the puppy party

14:40.234 --> 14:41.401
that we're having
in our cabin?

14:41.435 --> 14:42.402
Those puppies?

14:42.436 --> 14:43.403
What?

14:43.437 --> 14:44.671
Noo!

14:49.626 --> 14:52.045
Man, did you buy anything
for yourself today?

14:52.079 --> 14:53.296
Yeah, I got this
pack of socks.

14:53.331 --> 14:54.297
Plain white socks?

14:54.332 --> 14:55.498
That's not a treat!

14:55.550 --> 14:56.499
Donna!

14:56.551 --> 14:57.918
Get me away from him.

14:57.952 --> 15:00.053
Look. Maybe this is our
version of treat yourself day

15:00.087 --> 15:01.555
and he needs to do his version.

15:01.589 --> 15:02.806
What are you talking about?

15:02.840 --> 15:05.225
Wyatt, if you could blow
big money on one thing--

15:05.259 --> 15:06.726
not sock money--

15:06.761 --> 15:09.496
what would it be?

15:13.801 --> 15:15.302
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

15:15.336 --> 15:16.770
This is a whole new
level of nerd.

15:16.804 --> 15:18.605
You're right.
This is ridiculous.

15:18.639 --> 15:19.606
What am I doing?

15:19.640 --> 15:20.607
Wait. No, no, no, no.

15:20.641 --> 15:22.192
I mean that
in a good way, Ben.

15:22.243 --> 15:23.526
Listen to me,

15:23.578 --> 15:25.612
you're part of the
treat yourself team now, okay?

15:25.646 --> 15:27.514
If that costume
somehow makes you happy,

15:27.548 --> 15:29.416
you're gonna buy it.

15:29.450 --> 15:31.534
And you're gonna wear it
out of the store, okay?

15:31.586 --> 15:32.535
You're gonna treat yourself.

15:32.587 --> 15:33.553
Yeah, you know what?

15:33.588 --> 15:34.621
I'm gonna do that.

15:34.655 --> 15:36.155
I'm gonna--

15:36.173 --> 15:37.857
I'm gonna treat myself.

15:37.892 --> 15:39.893
Thanks, you guys.

15:41.529 --> 15:44.631
Thank you.

15:44.665 --> 15:46.499
I really needed this.

15:48.102 --> 15:52.038
I'm gonna treat myself.

15:52.073 --> 15:54.808
Uh-oh. Batman's crying.

15:54.842 --> 15:57.043
I am a goddess.

15:57.078 --> 15:59.696
A glorious female warrior.

15:59.730 --> 16:01.448
I am a goddess.

16:01.482 --> 16:04.017
A glorious female warrior.

16:04.051 --> 16:06.236
Queen of all that I survey.

16:06.287 --> 16:09.456
Queen of all that I survey.

16:09.490 --> 16:11.691
Enemies of fairness
and equality,

16:11.726 --> 16:13.576
hear my womanly roar.

16:13.628 --> 16:16.997
Enemies of fairness
and equality,

16:17.031 --> 16:19.699
hear my womanly roar.

16:25.339 --> 16:26.706
Congratulations,
you are now goddesses.

16:26.724 --> 16:28.541
Oh, my God!

16:29.560 --> 16:31.544
Now, have yourselves

16:31.562 --> 16:32.545
a puppy party.

16:34.000 --> 16:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

16:41.221 --> 16:42.956
Oh, boy.

16:46.821 --> 16:47.856
Hey.

16:47.916 --> 16:49.717
Can I sit down?

16:51.652 --> 16:54.788
Look, I didn't mean
for this to happen.

16:54.822 --> 16:57.791
I have a lot of respect
for the Pawnee Rangers,

16:57.825 --> 17:00.294
even if they were jerks
five years ago.

17:00.328 --> 17:02.229
You're not a jerk.

17:02.263 --> 17:04.998
You're a good troop leader.

17:05.032 --> 17:07.634
Not for these times I'm not.

17:07.669 --> 17:10.237
It's taken me a while
to see this,

17:10.271 --> 17:12.906
but these kids...

17:12.941 --> 17:15.041
I don't understand 'em.

17:15.076 --> 17:17.344
And they certainly
don't understand me.

17:17.377 --> 17:18.912
That's not true.

17:18.946 --> 17:20.614
No, it is.

17:20.647 --> 17:21.647
And it's okay.

17:21.683 --> 17:23.617
People change.

17:23.651 --> 17:25.685
Their interests change.

17:25.720 --> 17:28.655
It's the way of the world.

17:28.690 --> 17:31.908
When did kids get
so interested in fun?

17:33.962 --> 17:35.412
Ah...

17:35.463 --> 17:38.715
I'm gonna turn in.

17:38.750 --> 17:41.535
You were right, by the way.

17:41.569 --> 17:43.470
Your group is better.

17:49.811 --> 17:51.411
What's wrong?
Out with it.

17:51.446 --> 17:54.948
I was... seeing a woman,

17:54.983 --> 17:57.150
uh, for a while, and then

17:57.185 --> 17:59.353
we stopped seeing each other.

17:59.387 --> 18:01.855
Uh, pretty recently.

18:01.889 --> 18:04.274
That's why you've been
off your game.

18:04.325 --> 18:06.076
Sorry, dog.

18:06.110 --> 18:07.461
You're a catch, Wyatt.

18:07.495 --> 18:09.396
You're gonna be okay.

18:09.430 --> 18:10.931
There's chickenheads
everywhere, Ben.

18:10.965 --> 18:12.332
Chickenheads all around
this mall.

18:12.367 --> 18:14.334
You're gonna find one,
and you're gonna be great.

18:14.369 --> 18:15.335
But, for now,
why don't you let it out?

18:15.370 --> 18:17.371
Treat yourself
to a good cry.

18:19.090 --> 18:20.407
One question, though.

18:20.441 --> 18:22.292
Yeah?

18:22.343 --> 18:25.912
Why so serious?

18:28.299 --> 18:29.266
Wait, I got something.

18:29.300 --> 18:30.267
Oh!

18:30.301 --> 18:32.319
Cool! Awesome! Nice!

18:32.353 --> 18:34.054
Thanks, D-money.

18:34.088 --> 18:35.288
What kind of bait
did you use?

18:35.323 --> 18:37.808
I bought this mackerel
at the supermarket.

18:37.859 --> 18:39.092
I've been standing in the water

18:39.110 --> 18:40.093
with the fish on my hook

18:40.111 --> 18:42.029
for 30 minutes.

18:42.063 --> 18:44.064
I saw it on an episode
<i>I Love Lucy.</i>

18:44.098 --> 18:45.399
Pathetic? Maybe.

18:45.433 --> 18:47.300
But, feels pretty good
to have a bunch of little boys

18:47.335 --> 18:48.902
be super into me.

18:48.936 --> 18:49.903
That came out wrong.

18:49.937 --> 18:51.405
Ron!

18:51.439 --> 18:52.989
Come fish with us!

18:53.041 --> 18:54.908
That's okay.

18:54.942 --> 18:56.827
Seems like you have
things under control.

18:56.878 --> 18:57.944
Come on!

18:57.962 --> 18:59.379
Come do that thing
where you catch one

18:59.414 --> 19:00.547
with your hands!

19:00.581 --> 19:02.516
I've seen him do it,
it's incredible.

19:02.550 --> 19:03.517
Ron, come on!

19:03.551 --> 19:05.752
We need you
to help us have fun!

19:05.786 --> 19:07.454
First annual Leslie Knope

19:07.488 --> 19:09.673
remote control speedboat race!

19:12.527 --> 19:13.510
See ya Monday.

19:22.603 --> 19:23.687
Jerry.

19:23.738 --> 19:24.804
Where did you come from?

19:24.822 --> 19:26.807
Listen,
as I said earlier,

19:26.841 --> 19:29.159
I want keep everything
above board in regards

19:29.193 --> 19:30.544
to my relationship
with your daughter.

19:30.578 --> 19:33.747
And, as you know, Millicent
and I went out last night.

19:33.781 --> 19:35.449
And... it went terrific.

19:35.483 --> 19:36.533
Chris, that's great,

19:36.584 --> 19:37.534
but you really don't
have to do this.

19:37.585 --> 19:39.536
Again, the date was amazing,

19:39.587 --> 19:42.172
we had sparkling conversation,

19:42.206 --> 19:43.924
and, full disclosure,

19:43.958 --> 19:45.625
she did spend the night
at my house.

19:45.659 --> 19:47.127
Have a great day, Jerry.

19:54.168 --> 19:55.368
What are you doing here?

19:55.403 --> 19:56.803
We're here for the club.

19:56.837 --> 19:58.054
That was last week.

19:58.106 --> 19:59.606
The ad says today.

19:59.640 --> 20:00.640
Ad?

20:04.512 --> 20:06.012
"Are you tough as nails?

20:06.047 --> 20:07.697
" Would you rather sleep
on a bed of pine needles

20:07.732 --> 20:09.082
"than a mattress?

20:09.117 --> 20:10.917
"Do you find
video games pointless

20:10.952 --> 20:13.353
"and shopping malls stupid?

20:13.387 --> 20:15.322
"Do you march to the beat
of your own drummer?

20:15.356 --> 20:18.325
"Did you make the drum yourself?

20:18.359 --> 20:21.411
"If so, you might just have
what it takes to be

20:21.462 --> 20:23.079
"a Swanson.

20:23.131 --> 20:25.882
"Pawnee's most hardcore
outdoor club starts today.

20:25.917 --> 20:28.935
Boys and girls welcome."

20:31.139 --> 20:32.105
Swansons!

20:32.140 --> 20:34.407
Are you prepared
for whatever lies ahead?

20:34.442 --> 20:35.442
Yes, sir.

20:35.476 --> 20:36.560
Before we proceed,

20:36.594 --> 20:39.712
do any of have any
dietary restrictions?

20:39.730 --> 20:41.681
Correct, you do not.

20:41.715 --> 20:43.250
First outing is right now.

20:43.284 --> 20:44.484
I will be teaching you

20:44.519 --> 20:47.103
to dig a proper trench.

20:47.155 --> 20:48.955
Does that sound like
something you want to do?

20:48.990 --> 20:51.424
Yes, sir.

20:51.459 --> 20:53.493
This will be
no fun at all.

20:56.659 --> 20:59.893
<i>The Town of Pawnee invites you
to stay tuned for more Parks & Rec.</i>

21:00.059 --> 21:02.393
<i>And to try our delicious local corn.</i>

21:04.626 --> 21:06.427
The Internet's not working.

21:06.461 --> 21:07.428
Ben!

21:07.462 --> 21:08.563
We need your help.

21:08.597 --> 21:09.630
Guys, I've told you
how to do it.

21:09.665 --> 21:10.915
You just unplug the router

21:10.966 --> 21:12.583
and then you plug it
back in again.

21:15.971 --> 21:17.255
Guess I'll do it.

21:22.343 --> 21:23.494
Still not working.

21:23.628 --> 21:25.112
Well,
give it a minute. God.

21:27.916 --> 21:29.283
Okay, it's working.
