00:08.000 --> 00:10.241
WASHINGTON, DC

00:10.250 --> 00:12.912
At the end of
his two-year killing spree,

00:12.920 --> 00:14.239
seven women were dead.

00:14.250 --> 00:15.239
J. MILLER BOOKSTORE

00:16.670 --> 00:18.456
He made a name for himself.

00:19.080 --> 00:20.206
Literally.

00:20.580 --> 00:22.286
He sent out written communication

00:22.290 --> 00:24.781
identifying himself
as the Keystone Killer.

00:26.580 --> 00:30.949
These letters, all of which were
accompanied by a word search puzzle,

00:32.250 --> 00:33.956
were part of his game.

00:33.960 --> 00:36.747
Like Son of Sam, he taunted the police.

00:36.750 --> 00:39.321
He fueled
the media's fascination with him.

00:39.750 --> 00:41.456
As you'll see in the book,

00:41.460 --> 00:45.169
he left specific crime scene details
in the word puzzles.

00:46.580 --> 00:50.209
And then, 18 years ago,
he just stopped killing.

00:51.620 --> 00:54.418
Now, one of the
Philadelphia P.D.'s theories was

00:54.420 --> 00:57.241
that he was in jail
on an unrelated charge.

00:57.830 --> 01:00.708
But this is a man who craves attention.

01:00.710 --> 01:03.747
He could not remain
a faceless prisoner for so long.

01:04.420 --> 01:06.320
Another theory was
that he had simply moved away

01:06.330 --> 01:09.788
and he continued killing in another city
or another country.

01:09.790 --> 01:12.497
But the FBI's ViCAP program tracks murders

01:12.500 --> 01:15.992
and murderers all around the world
and they turned up nothing.

01:16.880 --> 01:20.031
This intricate knot
was part of his sngnature.

01:20.040 --> 01:22.827
It's a signature
we have never seen repeated.

01:22.830 --> 01:26.664
Another theory was that he had died,
which is the only explanation

01:26.670 --> 01:30.208
for why a compulsive psychopath
would stop killing.

01:30.960 --> 01:34.373
But I never believed he was
a psychopath who had to do this.

01:35.170 --> 01:39.072
I believe he is a narcissistic sociopath
who chooses to.

01:40.790 --> 01:42.746
This is his last victim.

01:42.750 --> 01:46.038
Amy Jennings. She was 23.

01:46.040 --> 01:49.248
Her infant son was in the next room
when she was killed.

01:52.500 --> 01:56.379
So even if he thinks he's finished,

01:57.500 --> 01:59.377
he still has a debt to pay.

02:02.210 --> 02:04.576
Thank you, Mr. Ryan. Thank you, sir.

02:07.880 --> 02:09.529
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

02:11.170 --> 02:13.161
You look comfortable up there.

02:13.460 --> 02:16.167
Why don't you come back to the BAU
for a guest lecture?

02:16.170 --> 02:19.378
-I'm retired, remember?
-Hell of a way to relax.

02:20.290 --> 02:23.168
323 pages on the one that got away.

02:23.170 --> 02:24.740
He hasn't gotten away.

02:25.710 --> 02:27.917
And you didn't count
that eight-page prologue.

02:27.920 --> 02:30.662
What happened to Florida

02:30.670 --> 02:32.376
No, Florida's too humid.

02:32.920 --> 02:36.617
Aanay, I'd miss the seasons.
So I'm in Philadelphia now.

02:37.210 --> 02:39.872
You're in Philadelphia for the "seasons"?

02:39.880 --> 02:43.418
You think I'm, what, dysfunctional

02:43.830 --> 02:48.039
You want to eat where the killer eats,
sleep where he sleeps?

02:48.040 --> 02:50.247
Maybe I'm addicted to Pat's Steaks.

02:50.500 --> 02:54.118
Maybe I'm holding out hope that the
Eagles will turn it around next season.

02:54.120 --> 02:56.327
Remember weapons of mass destruction?

02:56.330 --> 02:58.571
What are you saying

02:58.580 --> 03:02.038
I'm saying sometimes we get it wrong.
You ever consider that?

03:02.620 --> 03:04.417
I've considered everything.

03:07.380 --> 03:11.498
So, how are things at BAU

03:11.960 --> 03:16.329
Everything changes, everything stays
the same. You know how it is.

03:16.330 --> 03:17.786
-Miss me?
-No.

03:17.790 --> 03:20.281
-Just here to buy a book, then, huh

03:20.290 --> 03:23.453
Profilers, they fascinate me.

03:23.460 --> 03:26.281
Sorry to interrupt,
but this is for you.

03:28.750 --> 03:30.035
-Thanks.
-Sure.

03:33.170 --> 03:35.707
-Fan mail.
-Fan mail. How do you like that?

03:40.710 --> 03:43.167
Wait a minute. Hey, who gave this to you?

03:43.170 --> 03:45.491
I don't know. Guy in a blue jacket.

03:45.750 --> 03:47.035
Hey, hey, wait.

03:47.500 --> 03:50.207
That's not the guy. Hey, it's not the guy.

03:51.790 --> 03:52.996
What's going on?

03:53.580 --> 03:55.992
Sorry, sir. Misunderstanding.

04:00.670 --> 04:03.787
"Who in his mind
has not probed the black water?

04:04.580 --> 04:07.117
"We're like two volumes
of the same book, Max.

04:07.120 --> 04:09.497
"Why don't we add a few more chapters?"

04:09.880 --> 04:14.078
-Is this from him -Son of a bitch was right here.

04:15.580 --> 04:16.877
You still think I'm after a ghost?

04:18.080 --> 04:21.413
Lock this place down.
No one leaves until I talk to him.

04:55.750 --> 04:57.615
Norman Maclean wrote,

04:57.620 --> 05:00.327
"It is those we live with and love
and should know who elude us."

05:00.330 --> 05:01.410
F.B.I., Behavioral Analysis Unit
QUANTICO, VIRGINIA

05:03.880 --> 05:04.995
So they've been here all night?

05:05.000 --> 05:06.206
Apparently.

05:06.210 --> 05:08.371
Where else would any of us
be on a Saturday night?

05:08.380 --> 05:10.416
It's not like we have lives or anything.

05:10.420 --> 05:11.569
Speak for yourself.

05:11.580 --> 05:13.992
Guys, we are about to meet Max Ryan,

05:14.000 --> 05:16.537
the guy responsible
for catching the Boise child killer.

05:16.540 --> 05:19.452
-Have you ever talked to him before?
-He's pretty intense, brusque.

05:19.460 --> 05:22.782
-Not much of a bedside manner.
-Sound like anyone else we know?

05:22.790 --> 05:24.576
I heard he was forced
into early retirement.

05:24.580 --> 05:25.877
No, he chose to retire.

05:25.880 --> 05:27.950
He's written a new book
on the Keystone Killer case.

05:27.960 --> 05:30.611
He moved to Philadelphia
to be closer to the crime scenes.

05:30.620 --> 05:33.168
-That's retirement?
-Well, BAU-style.

05:39.210 --> 05:41.110
John Steinbeck, East of Eden.

05:41.920 --> 05:45.458
Story of good and evil, love and hate.

05:45.460 --> 05:48.452
There's been some new activity
on the Keystone Killer case.

05:48.460 --> 05:49.609
New?

05:49.620 --> 05:52.168
-He was at Max's lecture last night.
-What?

05:52.500 --> 05:53.615
He got away?

05:53.620 --> 05:56.248
Would we have woken you up
if we caught him?

05:58.920 --> 06:01.571
He handed this letter
to the security guard.

06:01.580 --> 06:04.413
And he included
two driver's licenses with it.

06:05.170 --> 06:07.991
One is from his last victim.
-Last known victim.

06:08.460 --> 06:11.998
Amy Jennings, strangled in 1987.

06:12.250 --> 06:14.741
"Wool socks."

06:17.040 --> 06:18.871
You see something?

06:19.330 --> 06:24.279
Yeah. What is the significance
of "black bra" and "grey wool socks"?

06:24.290 --> 06:26.451
That's what Amy Jennings was wearing
when we found her.

06:26.460 --> 06:28.951
That's a lot of detail
to remember for 20 years.

06:28.960 --> 06:30.780
The Green River Killer couldn't remember

06:30.790 --> 06:33.111
where the bodies were buried,
much less what they were wearing.

06:33.120 --> 06:34.667
Well, some UnSubs take pictures.

06:34.670 --> 06:38.572
Print them themselves so they can
manipulate the scene, bring it to life.

06:38.580 --> 06:40.116
That would explain the level of detail.

06:41.500 --> 06:44.788
Does "no fight" and "rear window" have
anything to do with the Jennings case?

06:44.790 --> 06:47.327
No. He entered in through the front door.

06:47.330 --> 06:50.618
There's ample evidence
that Amy fought him very hard.

06:50.620 --> 06:52.497
No, he's referring to a new victim there.

06:52.500 --> 06:54.957
Carla Bromwell.

06:54.960 --> 06:57.667
Yeah, there's a "C Bromwell" here
in the puzzle.

06:58.170 --> 07:01.537
Philly P.D. went to the address
on the license a little while ago.

07:01.540 --> 07:03.030
Found her suffocated with a plastic bag.

07:03.040 --> 07:04.280
Suffocated?

07:04.290 --> 07:06.872
His previous victims were strangled.
His MO's different.

07:06.880 --> 07:08.450
He hasn't been killing all along, has he?

07:08.460 --> 07:10.166
It would've been difficult
to tie these new murders

07:10.170 --> 07:12.411
to the Keystone Killer,
what with the change of methodology

07:12.420 --> 07:14.035
and the time that's elapsed between kills.

07:14.040 --> 07:16.497
If he had been active, I would have known.

07:16.500 --> 07:19.742
It's not entirely impossible
for an UnSub to switch his MO.

07:19.750 --> 07:22.378
The Zodiac Killer went from
stabbing people to shooting them.

07:22.380 --> 07:24.029
Yes, but he wanted to take the credit.

07:24.040 --> 07:26.417
This bastard didn't do anything in secret.

07:26.420 --> 07:29.787
I'd say good morning,
but it's still dark outside.

07:30.710 --> 07:32.610
-Who's this?
-Carla Bromwell.

07:32.620 --> 07:34.702
Gideon, can you put on the news?

07:35.790 --> 07:39.783
The Philadelphia Police were notified
late last night of a letter

07:40.080 --> 07:42.457
that was hand-delivered
to this news station.

07:42.460 --> 07:46.453
Apparently, it was written
by the infamous Keystone Killer,

07:46.460 --> 07:49.532
_ who's wanted in connection
WIth the murders of seven women

07:49.540 --> 07:51.667
back in the late 19805.

07:51.670 --> 07:54.491
He also included a photograph of a woman.

07:54.500 --> 07:59.073
She appears to be dead in the photo,
suffocated with a plastic bag.

07:59.920 --> 08:03.879
Now, subsequently, police discovered
a body in the Overbrook area,

08:03.880 --> 08:07.077
but they are not confirming
that it's the woman in this picture.

08:07.790 --> 08:10.782
-He works fast.
-That's an understatement, huh?

08:11.330 --> 08:13.787
Meet you on the plane in 30 minutes?

08:13.790 --> 08:15.371
I'm coming with you.

08:16.960 --> 08:18.609
I'm not asking, Jason.

08:26.540 --> 08:28.747
Philly P.D. confirmed
that Carla Bromwell's been dead

08:28.750 --> 08:29.910
less than 12 hours.

08:29.920 --> 08:31.114
She was 47.

08:32.170 --> 08:34.456
-Victims are getting older.
-That is unusual.

08:34.460 --> 08:36.416
Victimology rarely changes.

08:36.420 --> 08:38.240
Her hands and feet
were bound with Flex-cufs.

08:38.250 --> 08:40.115
Flex-cufs

08:40.540 --> 08:43.953
That's what they said. They're waiting
at the crime scene for you.

08:43.960 --> 08:46.667
-Thank you, sweetheart.
-Here if you need me.

08:46.920 --> 08:50.117
So, older victims and a different mode
of binding and killing.

08:50.120 --> 08:52.497
Maybe the note just means
we have a copycat on our hands.

08:52.500 --> 08:56.288
A copycat who just happens to
have Amy Jennings' driver's license?

08:56.920 --> 09:00.287
No. No, it's the Keystone Killer.

09:09.960 --> 09:12.201
How are we supposed to work with him?

09:12.920 --> 09:15.662
Gideon, he's not even an active agent.

09:16.620 --> 09:19.999
He's here because he knows this case
better than any of us.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.707
We're leading the investigation.
He's only consulting.

09:22.710 --> 09:24.610
Anyone tell him that?

09:43.380 --> 09:46.998
FBI? Detective Charles Santangelo,
Philly P.D.

09:47.420 --> 09:48.956
Agents Gideon and Greenaway.

09:48.960 --> 09:50.530
You actually think
the Keystone Killer did this?

09:50.540 --> 09:51.700
Yes, we do.

09:52.620 --> 09:54.668
-Agent Ryan.
-Detective.

09:54.670 --> 09:56.615
Should have guessed
you'd show up sooner or later.

09:56.620 --> 09:57.951
He's consulting with us.

09:57.960 --> 09:59.871
CSI's done processing the body?

09:59.880 --> 10:02.371
-Yeah. We'll get out of your way.
-Thanks.

10:04.670 --> 10:06.160
This is his eighth victim.

10:06.170 --> 10:09.992
There's no bruising on the wrists,
ankles or neck.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.321
Just a good-sized blunt force head wound.

10:12.330 --> 10:14.321
Yeah, probably a surprise attack.

10:14.330 --> 10:16.207
Well, the puzzle said "no fight."

10:16.210 --> 10:18.075
I know what the puzzle said.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.668
Head wound is extensive.

10:22.670 --> 10:24.991
-Level of violence is escalating.
-Yeah.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.663
This bedroom is in the front of the house,

10:28.670 --> 10:31.036
and the puzzle mentioned a rear window.

10:31.040 --> 10:33.497
-Maybe he left a print.
-No way.

10:34.880 --> 10:37.166
Well, I think
I'm going to check it out anyway.

10:37.170 --> 10:38.285
You do what you want to do,

10:38.290 --> 10:40.667
but believe me, you're wasting your time.

10:43.670 --> 10:46.571
-Elle's good at this, Max.
-Did I say she wasn't?

10:49.000 --> 10:52.458
I haven't had a feeling like this
around a dead body in 18 years.

10:52.460 --> 10:55.202
I remember what you said to me
on my first day.

10:55.210 --> 10:58.373
"Don't lose your objectivity.
This isn't personal."

10:58.670 --> 11:00.661
Yeah, well, maybe not for you.

11:09.710 --> 11:11.666
We are aware of the media reports,

11:11.670 --> 11:13.410
however, we cannot confirm at this time.

11:13.420 --> 11:14.990
Is it the Keystone Killer?

11:15.000 --> 11:17.958
The FBI will be making
a formal statement later on today.

11:17.960 --> 11:20.611
We received more information
from the murderer than the police.

11:20.620 --> 11:23.498
-What's going on?
-We have a right to the truth.

11:23.500 --> 11:26.742
The Philadelphia Police have to finish
investigating this crime scene

11:26.750 --> 11:28.035
before we can make a statement.

11:28.040 --> 11:29.871
All of your questions
will be answered at that time,

11:29.880 --> 11:32.576
so please be patient.
That's all I can say.

11:32.580 --> 11:35.117
Ma'am, when can we
expect that statement today?

11:35.120 --> 11:36.997
Do you know anything about motive?

11:37.750 --> 11:41.072
-What do you think of Ryan?
-He hasn't changed much.

11:41.080 --> 11:43.162
I think we can learn a lot from him.

11:43.170 --> 11:45.491
What could you possibly learn
that you don't already know?

11:45.500 --> 11:47.912
Hotch, repetitive thinking
is a death knell for the brain.

11:47.920 --> 11:51.458
For complete brain usage,
diverse stimulation is the key.

11:53.580 --> 11:54.820
Look at this.

11:59.620 --> 12:01.668
Let's go show this to everyone.

12:05.790 --> 12:07.246
Found another note.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.319
Let me see that.

12:10.920 --> 12:13.115
"In order
for the light to shine so brightly,

12:13.120 --> 12:14.872
"the darkness must be present."

12:14.880 --> 12:17.280
He's quoting Sir Francis Bacon now.

12:17.290 --> 12:21.249
-Yeah. I use this specific quote in my...
-In your book, on page 184.

12:22.330 --> 12:24.412
I read it on the plane.

12:24.420 --> 12:26.490
And you remember
the page number of the quote?

12:26.500 --> 12:27.660
Don't ask.

12:27.670 --> 12:30.116
He says to expect another gift
in two days.

12:30.120 --> 12:33.078
-A gift?
-Calls his victims gifts.

12:33.080 --> 12:35.662
-Gifts for whom?
-For me.

13:16.040 --> 13:19.669
PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA

13:24.040 --> 13:25.496
A lot of things have changed
in 20 years,

13:25.500 --> 13:27.786
including the age
of the Keystone Killer's victims.

13:27.790 --> 13:30.577
He's older. His victims are older.
Makes sense to me.

13:30.580 --> 13:32.878
Most UnSubs have
specific fantasies.

13:32.880 --> 13:35.531
It's as if they're killing the same person
over and over again.

13:35.540 --> 13:37.997
This man clearly had a preference
for young brunettes,

13:38.000 --> 13:39.285
and now he's switched to older women.

13:39.290 --> 13:40.496
Well, what does that mean?

13:40.500 --> 13:43.742
Ted Bundy only killed women
that looked like his fiance.

13:43.750 --> 13:47.163
But then he devolved and he brutally
attacked a house full of sorority sisters

13:47.170 --> 13:49.320
that looked nothing like
his previous victims.

13:51.920 --> 13:55.572
His final victim was a 12-year-old girl.

13:55.580 --> 13:58.037
When police found the van
that he used to kill her,

13:58.040 --> 14:01.578
the amount of blood revealed
that he had lost complete control.

14:01.580 --> 14:05.493
It was that de-evolution
that eventually led to hIs capture.

14:05.500 --> 14:07.786
He could be de-evolving into a frenzy.

14:07.790 --> 14:09.246
So you mean he's about to mess up?

14:09.250 --> 14:11.286
The Keystone Killer's
de-evolution is only a theory.

14:11.290 --> 14:12.780
We need to be prepared for anything.

14:12.790 --> 14:16.374
And if he is in a frenzy, there's no
telling how quickly he'll fall apart.

14:16.380 --> 14:18.450
Or how many more victims
he'll take with him.

14:18.460 --> 14:21.281
So, we're going to go over
everything we know, old and new,

14:21.290 --> 14:24.282
and hopefully find him
before we find another body.

14:25.210 --> 14:27.667
We'll start with
Agent Ryan's original profile.

14:27.670 --> 14:29.535
Max, you want to present it?

14:29.920 --> 14:30.989
No.

14:35.500 --> 14:38.071
We're looking for a white male
in his late forties.

14:38.080 --> 14:39.206
The controlled crime scenes,

14:39.210 --> 14:41.246
the meticulousness _
and his collection of trophies

14:41.250 --> 14:43.457
suggests a possible military background.

14:43.460 --> 14:46.167
We believe he's been living
in the same geographic area

14:46.170 --> 14:47.706
his entire adult life...

14:53.830 --> 14:56.162
Ithought
you were going to present the profile.

14:56.170 --> 14:57.740
Team can handle it.

14:59.040 --> 15:00.109
The team.

15:01.290 --> 15:03.918
We used to work solo
when this all started.

15:05.250 --> 15:06.740
Well, we were wrong.

15:07.420 --> 15:09.741
You don't worry about too many cooks?

15:10.500 --> 15:11.615
Nope.

15:17.290 --> 15:20.919
He used a quote, Jason.
He used a quote from my book.

15:21.830 --> 15:25.459
So? Maybe it's a coincidence.

15:28.290 --> 15:31.373
We've both been doing this too long
to believe that.

15:37.460 --> 15:39.872
All right, let's focus on the
differences in the crimes.

15:39.880 --> 15:41.108
What's he doing that's new?

15:41.120 --> 15:44.169
Well, his latest victim
was hit in the head. That's new.

15:44.170 --> 15:47.788
In the word puzzle he said
she didn't fight, so why hit her?

15:48.250 --> 15:50.536
Scare her

15:51.120 --> 15:52.246
Well, he never did that before.

15:52.250 --> 15:54.787
And a blow that hard wouldn't
scare her. It would probably just...

15:54.790 --> 15:56.326
It'd probably just
knock her unconscious.

15:56.330 --> 15:57.661
In order to control her?

15:57.670 --> 16:00.787
Well, he switched
from using rope to Flex-cufs.

16:00.790 --> 16:03.031
The intricate_knot
was part of his Signature.

16:03.040 --> 16:05.873
Flex-cufs are easier.
Probably saved him time.

16:05.880 --> 16:07.165
No, no, no, no. It's more than that.

16:07.170 --> 16:10.037
The rope was meticulously tied.
It was intimate.

16:10.040 --> 16:11.200
Completely unnecessary.

16:11.210 --> 16:13.917
And he abandoned the rope
and the use of his bare hands,

16:13.920 --> 16:17.458
which makes his kills less personal
and less controlling.

16:19.750 --> 16:22.822
Okay. Seriously, guys,
let's just abandon all this.

16:22.830 --> 16:24.707
Let's just treat him
like he's a new offender.

16:24.710 --> 16:25.779
He isn't.

16:26.580 --> 16:27.911
Guys, I have a name.

16:30.540 --> 16:33.748
"Nibrahs." That's a name

16:34.080 --> 16:36.116
It's backwards. S. Harbin.

16:36.120 --> 16:38.372
There's a Scott Harbin _
on Ryan's original suspect list.

16:38.380 --> 16:40.029
It's not Scott Harbin.

16:40.960 --> 16:44.327
Harbin went to jail in 1988
for stabbing a guy

16:44.330 --> 16:46.707
while he was trying to escape
during a home invasion.

16:46.710 --> 16:47.950
The guy later died.

16:47.960 --> 16:50.872
Harbin didn't even know there was _
anyone at home at the time he broke in.

16:50.880 --> 16:53.246
-How long did he get?
-Thirty years.

16:53.250 --> 16:55.320
So, that makes him
a little more than halfway done.

16:55.330 --> 16:56.661
Unless he's been paroled.

16:56.670 --> 16:58.661
No. No, that's too easy.

16:58.670 --> 17:02.379
I interviewed Harbin, twice.
He's a pervert.

17:02.380 --> 17:04.826
He's a small-time burglar
with a fetish for lingerie.

17:04.830 --> 17:08.288
I mean, he's a creep,
but he is not the Keystone Killer.

17:09.540 --> 17:12.782
Believe me, our guy has not been in jail
all these years.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.410
All right, I'm going to call Garcia.

17:15.420 --> 17:16.876
See what she can dig up on this guy.

17:16.880 --> 17:18.245
He's not the guy!

17:29.290 --> 17:31.747
-Jason, what are we doing here

17:31.750 --> 17:33.957
Well, is Ryan interested
in catching the Keystone Killer

17:33.960 --> 17:35.780
or just proving he's right?

17:43.290 --> 17:46.703
Scott Harbin was paroled three months ago.

17:46.710 --> 17:48.029
Oh, yeah

17:48.040 --> 17:51.282
Yeah, looks like it. And, hey, guess what?

17:51.290 --> 17:54.703
Bad boy missed his last appointment
with his parole officer.

17:54.710 --> 17:56.575
Well, that right there makes him
a wanted man, doesn't it?

17:56.580 --> 17:57.660
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

17:58.080 --> 17:59.991
And I have an address on him.

18:00.960 --> 18:02.575
You are amazing.

18:02.580 --> 18:04.241
You have no idea.

18:10.170 --> 18:11.819
FBI! SWAT!

18:12.500 --> 18:14.377
Stop! I said stop!

18:16.290 --> 18:18.918
Okay, okay!
All right, all right, all right.

18:18.920 --> 18:20.490
-Are you Scott Harbin

18:20.500 --> 18:23.617
-Scott Harbin?
-Yeah, that's Scott Harbin.

18:23.620 --> 18:25.827
-Hey! Ryan.
-Come on.

18:26.790 --> 18:28.166
You got old.

18:28.790 --> 18:30.200
Haven't we all?

18:31.710 --> 18:34.076
-You missed an appointment, Scott.
-Oh.

18:34.080 --> 18:36.321
They send the FBI now
for parole violations?

18:36.330 --> 18:38.116
Yeah, we were in the neighborhood.

18:38.120 --> 18:39.326
Excuse me, fellas.

18:46.420 --> 18:47.614
Thanks.

18:50.460 --> 18:51.666
-Hotch?
-Yeah.

18:51.670 --> 18:52.955
Look at that.

18:52.960 --> 18:55.246
Socks three inches, undenNear six inches.

18:55.250 --> 18:56.660
They teach you that at basic training.

18:56.670 --> 18:59.491
Ryan thought
he might have a military background.

19:00.710 --> 19:01.916
Hey, Morgan!

19:02.580 --> 19:05.037
What's the chance he labels his secrets?

19:11.380 --> 19:14.281
-What do you think?
-I don't know.

19:15.710 --> 19:18.747
He does seem to be a guy
who needs to be in control.

19:20.120 --> 19:21.951
He's definitely obsessive.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.991
Everything has its place.

19:26.120 --> 19:28.668
Probably comes
from years of solitude, huh?

19:29.080 --> 19:30.411
And a strict upbringing.

19:30.420 --> 19:33.321
I mean, this is a guy
who likes to be alone.

19:33.330 --> 19:35.958
Sharing a jail cell
must've been a nightmare.

19:36.620 --> 19:38.030
Are you finished?

19:39.880 --> 19:42.781
What, did I make you angry

19:43.500 --> 19:45.456
What, you're going to hurt me?

19:45.460 --> 19:46.825
I'm not stupid.

19:46.830 --> 19:50.038
No, you wouldn't hurt me here.

19:50.290 --> 19:51.496
You'd wait.

19:51.500 --> 19:54.037
Sneak up behind me
and hit me over the head

19:54.040 --> 19:55.780
just when I'm not looking.

19:56.620 --> 19:58.451
What's the matter, Scotty?

19:58.790 --> 20:02.078
Can't deal with a woman
who's not afraid of you?

20:14.500 --> 20:15.990
Hey, Morgan.

20:16.380 --> 20:17.449
Yo.

20:19.500 --> 20:21.536
Think he makes his own movies?

20:22.080 --> 20:25.322
Well, if he's the control freak
Ryan thinks he is, why wouldn't he?

20:25.330 --> 20:26.820
Where are the tapes?

20:34.750 --> 20:37.207
-You okay

20:39.500 --> 20:40.819
Got a little hot.

20:40.830 --> 20:43.537
-Did I say anything that wasn't true?
-No.

20:48.290 --> 20:50.201
Well, then, I guess I'm fine.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.991
-Hear that?
-Yeah.

21:04.920 --> 21:06.376
I got it. I got it.

21:07.830 --> 21:09.411
Oh, man. Give me a hand.

21:09.420 --> 21:11.035
-What?
-Give me a hand.

21:11.380 --> 21:12.574
What the hell?

21:16.750 --> 21:18.286
Hey! Little help!

21:18.710 --> 21:20.826
-No!No!No!
-It's okay. It's okay.

21:22.380 --> 21:23.529
We're with the FBI.

21:23.540 --> 21:25.701
Get an ambulance right now! Move!

21:25.710 --> 21:27.530
I'm on it. Call EMT.

21:34.830 --> 21:36.036
Roger that.

21:37.580 --> 21:38.706
Yeah. Here he comes.

21:38.710 --> 21:42.032
I'll bring him out
and then I'll call you back.

21:45.880 --> 21:46.949
Scott Harbin.

21:46.960 --> 21:50.327
Single, obsessive, military background.
Fits your profile.

21:50.330 --> 21:53.458
But he keeps his victim in his house

21:53.460 --> 21:54.575
Ryan.

21:57.170 --> 21:58.876
It's got your name on it.

22:02.210 --> 22:05.919
_ "Isn't Scott Harbin
an inelegant creature? A monster.

22:06.170 --> 22:09.879
"There is no light with him.
No balance. He is pure evil.

22:10.290 --> 22:12.611
"Balance is what gives one mercy.

22:12.620 --> 22:15.919
"You'll be reminded
of my brand of mercy tomorrow, Max."

22:15.920 --> 22:17.069
What does that mean?

22:17.080 --> 22:20.117
Scott Harbin's a predator,
just not the one we're looking for.

22:20.120 --> 22:22.247
Cordon off the area.
At least a six-block radius.

22:22.250 --> 22:23.820
Someone must have seen this guy.

22:28.880 --> 22:30.074
Well, that's got to be a first.

22:30.080 --> 22:31.877
A killer actually leading us
to another killer.

22:31.880 --> 22:34.451
Come on, we all know
they make the best profilers.

22:34.460 --> 22:35.700
They admire each other's work.

22:35.710 --> 22:37.371
Yeah, but usually from afar.

22:37.380 --> 22:38.870
Well, at least we got Harbin
off the street.

22:38.880 --> 22:40.029
All right. Let's review.

22:40.040 --> 22:42.372
What do we know about the Keystone Killer?

22:42.380 --> 22:45.076
Well, we know
that he's not dead or in jail.

22:45.080 --> 22:48.243
-Enjoys the taunting, the game.
-And he's in complete control.

22:48.250 --> 22:50.536
He strangled seven women in the 1980s,

22:50.540 --> 22:53.782
stopped for 18 years and then
began again, suffocating them.

22:53.790 --> 22:56.953
I mean, 10% of all violent crimes
are caused by strangulation.

22:56.960 --> 22:59.997
It only takes 11 pounds of pressure
to fully incapacitate your victim.

23:00.000 --> 23:03.379
And if you hang on for at least
50 seconds, they'll never recover.

23:03.380 --> 23:04.495
But when you suffocate someone

23:04.500 --> 23:06.456
you actually have less control
over their death.

23:06.460 --> 23:07.779
And it's actually more passive

23:07.790 --> 23:11.328
because the killer
doesn't feel the life leaving the body.

23:11.330 --> 23:13.821
You know, he's changed
almost everything that he does.

23:13.830 --> 23:15.707
Why, why, why, why?

23:15.710 --> 23:17.746
I mean,
what's he getting out of this new MO?

23:17.750 --> 23:19.536
What is his payoff?

23:19.540 --> 23:22.953
You got Carla Bromwell.
She sustains a significant head injury.

23:22.960 --> 23:26.111
Blitz attacks suggest disorganization,
no self-confidence.

23:26.120 --> 23:29.453
This is a guy who walks into
seven victims' homes prior to this.

23:29.460 --> 23:31.416
There was no forced entry
at any of the scenes.

23:31.420 --> 23:33.615
Where's the loss of confidence?

23:33.620 --> 23:36.202
He would never change
the way he kills by choice.

23:36.210 --> 23:37.370
What?

23:37.380 --> 23:38.995
Well, we've been operating
under the assumption

23:39.000 --> 23:41.161
that he purposely changed his MO.

23:41.830 --> 23:43.821
You say he changed
because he had to change?

23:43.830 --> 23:46.958
He knocked her unconscious,
and it wasn't to scare her.

23:47.330 --> 23:50.379
Because he couldn't control her
phy5ically while she's awake.

23:50.380 --> 23:53.497
-He could be incapacitated.
-At least partially.

23:53.500 --> 23:55.491
-Maybe an injury.
-Or a stroke.

23:55.500 --> 23:58.037
Either way, you're going to have to
have medical records. Agreed?

23:58.040 --> 23:59.701
Yeah. So what are we talking about?

23:59.710 --> 24:03.032
This had to have happened after
the middle of 1988 in Philadelphia?

24:03.040 --> 24:05.668
To somebody who fits
the rest of the profile.

24:05.960 --> 24:08.110
That's a lot of hospital records.

24:08.790 --> 24:10.530
Call our girl Friday.

24:10.540 --> 24:11.700
Okay.

24:13.210 --> 24:15.747
We're releasing a profile
of the man we're looking for.

24:15.750 --> 24:18.071
We're hoping that
someone out there seeing this

24:18.080 --> 24:20.958
will recognize some of the elements.

24:20.960 --> 24:24.168
He is most likely a white male
in his late forties

24:24.170 --> 24:27.162
with a military background
and well-educated.

24:27.170 --> 24:29.786
He has a need for power and control,

24:29.790 --> 24:33.112
so he probably has a job
with some type of authority.

24:33.120 --> 24:36.874
You've just described half of the men
living in Philadelphia.

24:36.880 --> 24:38.871
-How does that help us?
-If you'd let me finish...

24:38.880 --> 24:42.702
The killer wrote in his last letter
that he'd strike again within two days.

24:42.710 --> 24:44.371
How close are you to an arrest?

24:44.380 --> 24:48.328
I'm not at liberty to discuss the
progress of this ongoing investigation.

24:48.330 --> 24:50.537
My name is Philip Bromwell.

24:52.210 --> 24:54.610
My sister, Carla, was murdered yesterday

24:55.250 --> 24:58.879
by a man you people
should have stopped 18 years ago.

24:58.880 --> 25:02.418
Are you "at liberty" to explain

25:02.420 --> 25:05.116
how I'm supposed to tell our mother
about this?

25:07.960 --> 25:11.669
I am very sorry
for your loss, Mr. Bromwell.

25:11.670 --> 25:14.036
Please know that we do have
the very best team assembled

25:14.040 --> 25:15.280
to handle this.

25:15.290 --> 25:18.748
Isn't Special Agent Ryan
working with the FBI again?

25:18.750 --> 25:20.957
He was unable to solve the murder before.

25:20.960 --> 25:23.030
What makes you think he's capable now?

25:23.040 --> 25:26.919
Agent Ryan was one of
a number of men working on this case.

25:27.620 --> 25:30.703
There is no blame to be put
on any one man or division.

25:34.460 --> 25:37.202
I'd hate to be standing out there
in front of those jackals.

25:37.210 --> 25:39.667
Well, JJ, she can hold her own.

25:39.670 --> 25:42.207
You're all better at the press thing
than we ever were.

25:42.210 --> 25:44.997
Well, we have a lot more of it
to deal with now.

25:47.330 --> 25:49.116
They need someone to blame.

25:50.790 --> 25:52.075
I guess it's me.

25:52.710 --> 25:54.701
Are you okay with that?

25:54.710 --> 25:57.827
Well, the fact is,
I haven't been able to solve the case.

25:57.830 --> 25:59.491
So I'm an easy target.

25:59.790 --> 26:00.950
But if I...

26:02.420 --> 26:06.072
If we do close it, that'll all go away.

26:07.500 --> 26:10.788
And you think you'll be able to

26:12.830 --> 26:14.570
Well, I won't have any choice.

26:14.580 --> 26:16.207
But don't you want to?

26:16.210 --> 26:19.168
I mean, don't you get to a certain point
where you want to relax?

26:19.170 --> 26:21.616
Maybe spend some time with your family?

26:21.620 --> 26:22.666
Family?

26:24.040 --> 26:27.783
I lost that a long time ago.
I haven't even seen them in years.

26:31.540 --> 26:32.996
As far as relaxing,

26:33.790 --> 26:35.917
the BAU doesn't employ too many agents

26:35.920 --> 26:39.788
with a relaxing kind of mentality,
do they?

26:43.080 --> 26:46.038
Well, we've got some records
to go through.

27:05.210 --> 27:07.872
Hi. What's up?

27:17.080 --> 27:19.571
Something debilitating enough
to lose strength permanently.

27:19.580 --> 27:21.377
I'm still thinking stroke.

27:22.620 --> 27:25.578
You know, Ryan's profile
puts the UnSub in his late twenties.

27:25.580 --> 27:27.411
Isn't that too young for a massive stroke?

27:27.420 --> 27:29.570
Technically, you're never too young
for a stroke.

27:29.580 --> 27:31.070
80% of strokes are ischemic.

27:31.080 --> 27:33.958
The other 20% are hemorrhagic,
which usually result in death.

27:33.960 --> 27:36.576
Ischemic_ strokes occur _
when plaque bUIlds up in the arteries,

27:36.580 --> 27:39.117
causing restricted vessels
to be blocked by a blood clot.

27:39.120 --> 27:41.873
Okay, but doesn't it take years
for that type of plaque to build up?

27:41.880 --> 27:43.074
Typically.

27:43.080 --> 27:45.116
Well, then, like I said, he was too young.

27:45.120 --> 27:47.532
Did you know that stroke victims
who play virtual reality games

27:47.540 --> 27:50.612
show significant advances in recovery
than those who don't?

27:50.620 --> 27:52.531
Now, here's somebody. In 1987 he was 30,

27:52.540 --> 27:54.246
single, dishonourable discharge.

27:54.250 --> 27:55.990
That's a good start. What was the injury?

27:56.000 --> 27:59.538
Broken neck.
Intense physical therapy for nine years.

27:59.540 --> 28:01.826
-What's he been doing since?
-Oh, never mind.

28:01.830 --> 28:04.492
The guy moved to the Florida Keys.
He's a scuba instructor.

28:04.500 --> 28:06.240
He's got the right idea.

28:07.250 --> 28:09.912
Come on. _ _
There's got to be something in here.

28:15.040 --> 28:16.371
Taking a break?

28:17.290 --> 28:20.077
Is there anything worse
than cop shop coffee?

28:20.750 --> 28:22.957
Day-old cop shop doughnuts?

28:23.880 --> 28:27.031
You know, at home I actually have to
make the coffee bad now to enjoy it.

28:27.040 --> 28:28.996
Yeah, I've had what you make.

28:29.540 --> 28:31.451
You're saying
you did that to me on purpose?

28:31.460 --> 28:33.496
Well, what are friends for?

28:33.500 --> 28:37.163
Remember that Boise child murderer?

28:37.790 --> 28:39.371
How could I forget him?

28:39.380 --> 28:41.996
The lead city detective,
Griffin was his name, right?

28:42.000 --> 28:43.160
Yeah.

28:43.170 --> 28:45.991
I remember, we got there,
that man was nearly suicidal.

28:46.000 --> 28:48.286
Well, he had kids dropping
around him like flies.

28:48.290 --> 28:49.416
You told him feeling guilty

28:49.420 --> 28:51.820
when a series of crimes is occurring
that you can't stop,

28:51.830 --> 28:53.411
natural response.

28:53.420 --> 28:56.742
Important thing, not to let yourself
become another victim.

28:56.750 --> 28:59.287
-Hey, this is different.
-Rea|ly?

28:59.710 --> 29:00.745
Really.

29:01.830 --> 29:05.823
You see, Jason, somewhere,
I think in my subconscious,

29:05.830 --> 29:08.287
I hoped that writing this book
would draw him out.

29:08.290 --> 29:10.281
That he missed the attention.

29:10.290 --> 29:14.283
And maybe...
Maybe I wanted to play his game.

29:15.620 --> 29:18.999
-You had no idea he'd kill again.
-No, but he did.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.207
And now there's_another woman
out there in danger.

29:21.210 --> 29:25.988
Max, you know this man
better than he knows himself.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.116
You always have.
Now you've got an advantage.

29:28.120 --> 29:31.203
You got a team of the most incredible
agents in the world out there.

29:31.210 --> 29:33.280
And you're standing here alone.

29:33.540 --> 29:36.247
If you let us, we'll help you find him.

29:50.830 --> 29:53.207
Elle is running down injuries
on college campuses.

29:53.210 --> 29:55.496
The guy's well-read.
He may have been a professor.

29:55.500 --> 29:58.788
There are just too many hospitals,
clinics, long-term care facilities.

29:58.790 --> 30:00.781
We'd be sifting through records for weeks.

30:00.790 --> 30:02.166
Oh, come on. There's got to be some way

30:02.170 --> 30:03.319
to narrow down the search, right?

30:03.330 --> 30:04.536
Well, we've ruled out a stroke

30:04.540 --> 30:07.373
and half the hospitals don't even say
how the accident occurred.

30:07.380 --> 30:08.779
Accidents?

30:08.790 --> 30:12.078
In America, someone's involved in
a car accident once every 10 seconds.

30:12.080 --> 30:15.243
Car accidents with injuries
would all be reported by the police.

30:15.250 --> 30:18.117
We profiled him driving a late-model
American-made sedan.

30:18.120 --> 30:20.668
All right, so how about I get Garcia
to check Philly P.D. records

30:20.670 --> 30:22.240
_ _ for accidents
involvmg American-made sedans

30:22.250 --> 30:23.410
and serious injury?

30:23.420 --> 30:25.490
-It's a long shot.
-It's a shot.

30:26.380 --> 30:30.328
Start with 1988. If it was an accident,
it stopped him in his tracks.

30:34.380 --> 30:36.666
I need a list, sweetness.

30:36.670 --> 30:40.822
Sugar, you're in luck.
Lists are my speciality. Go.

30:40.830 --> 30:43.537
All right. Philadelphia. 1988.

30:43.540 --> 30:46.202
I need all caraccidents
resulting in injuries.

30:48.040 --> 30:50.167
Wow, there's a lot of them.

30:50.170 --> 30:52.377
Guess friends
let friends drive drunk back then.

30:52.380 --> 30:56.783
Okay, got injuries.
Thirty-six in a 12-month period.

30:56.790 --> 30:59.202
-How many were American-made cars?
-Almost all of them.

30:59.210 --> 31:03.533
Except only five were serious enough
to send the drivers to the hospital.

31:03.540 --> 31:05.167
Let's hear it for American-made safety.

31:06.380 --> 31:07.574
Tell me who the drivers were.

31:07.580 --> 31:10.879
Okay, one happened on I-95 by the airport.

31:11.120 --> 31:17.411
Ambulance picked up the other driver
outside of 3245 Anders Street.

31:17.420 --> 31:18.569
Ow.

31:18.580 --> 31:20.411
Broken back. That's not good.

31:20.420 --> 31:22.376
Wait, Anders Street...

31:22.380 --> 31:25.031
3200 block of Anders?

31:26.250 --> 31:27.990
That's where Carla Bromwell lived.

31:28.000 --> 31:32.209
Well, that driver's name is Walter Kern,
currently 48 years old,

31:32.210 --> 31:35.998
and still residing
in the City of Brother and Sisterly Love.

31:36.580 --> 31:38.912
If he's 48, that would've put him
in his late twenties

31:38.920 --> 31:40.535
at the time of the killings.

31:41.290 --> 31:43.076
Just like Ryan predicted.

31:43.710 --> 31:46.076
Walter Kern had a military background.

31:46.790 --> 31:50.328
ROTC in high school.
Four years in the Air Force.

31:50.330 --> 31:53.538
Hospital records show that
he lost mobility in his right side

31:53.540 --> 31:56.498
due to severed nerve damage
to his spinal cord.

31:56.500 --> 31:58.240
He never got the strength back.

31:58.250 --> 32:00.320
Kern's been a county worker,
claims adjuster,

32:00.330 --> 32:04.118
and get this, he installed
home alarms with Scott Harbin.

32:04.120 --> 32:05.701
Takes one to know one.

32:05.710 --> 32:08.201
All those jobs
allowed him access to people's homes.

32:08.210 --> 32:10.610
Explains why
there's no sign of forced entry.

32:10.620 --> 32:13.077
He had a legitimate reason
to knock on the door.

32:13.080 --> 32:15.617
Women felt comfortable letting him inside.

32:15.620 --> 32:19.738
He got a degree in criminology
from Villanova in 1988.

32:19.750 --> 32:22.071
I wonder if he murdered anyone on campus.

32:22.080 --> 32:24.958
That certainly explains
his knowledge of law enforcement.

32:24.960 --> 32:27.281
This looks like our guy.
Anybody got a current address?

32:27.290 --> 32:30.202
575 Wight Street, Southeast Philadelphia.

32:30.210 --> 32:32.667
I got you, you son of a bitch.

32:33.120 --> 32:35.327
We got him. Let's go bring him in.

33:05.080 --> 33:07.036
-Hey, Walter. Come on in.
-Hi.

33:21.830 --> 33:23.036
How can I help you, gentlemen?

33:23.040 --> 33:24.450
I'm Special Agent Jason Gideon.

33:24.460 --> 33:26.826
This is Special Agent Max Ryan
with the FBI.

33:26.830 --> 33:29.913
-Can we speak with Walter Kern?
-He's not here right now.

33:29.920 --> 33:31.569
Do you know where he is?

33:31.580 --> 33:34.117
-Is something wrong

33:37.540 --> 33:42.034
What are you going to do

33:43.210 --> 33:44.245
Why?

33:44.710 --> 33:46.325
Put on these cuffs.

33:46.920 --> 33:48.069
Do it.

33:51.460 --> 33:52.609
Now!

33:57.210 --> 34:00.327
Walter's at the Pinewood Community
Center working with the Boy Scouts.

34:00.330 --> 34:02.161
He volunteers as one of the leaders.

34:02.170 --> 34:04.206
Would it be possible for us
to search the house, ma'am?

34:04.210 --> 34:06.166
Hotch, he's at
the Pinewood Community Center.

34:06.170 --> 34:07.410
What for?

34:07.420 --> 34:08.876
We've been called in to investigate

34:08.880 --> 34:11.496
the murders of several women
here in Philadelphia.

34:11.500 --> 34:13.570
That's why we need to talk to him.

34:13.580 --> 34:17.573
That is the craziest thing
I've ever heard.

34:23.380 --> 34:26.497
And I'm going to have to
ask you to leave. Now.

34:28.750 --> 34:30.706
Does your husband have an area
here in the house

34:30.710 --> 34:32.325
that you're never supposed to go into?

34:32.330 --> 34:34.742
A place that you're not supposed to see?

34:36.210 --> 34:38.246
Walter has a darkroom.

34:38.250 --> 34:40.206
If he knew you were in there,

34:40.620 --> 34:43.919
would he become so angry
that you fear he could hurt you?

34:46.830 --> 34:51.824
He just doesn't want me
to ruin his pictures, that's all.

34:51.830 --> 34:54.287
Mrs. Kern, has your husband ever suffered

34:54.290 --> 34:56.372
from long periods of depression?

34:58.290 --> 35:02.112
Yes, after his car accident.

35:02.120 --> 35:05.704
And did he suddenly just snap
out of it, for no apparent reason?

35:10.210 --> 35:11.780
What does all this mean?

35:11.790 --> 35:14.076
Could you show us the room, Mrs. Kern?

35:24.580 --> 35:25.706
It's clear.

35:41.040 --> 35:43.782
Looks like he collected every article
written about him.

35:45.500 --> 35:46.819
He's got your book.

35:48.880 --> 35:50.996
Damn it, I signed it.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.161
Hotch was entirely correct
about the photography.

35:53.170 --> 35:55.877
This cellar's
where he develops his photographs.

35:57.290 --> 35:58.746
What's that

35:58.750 --> 36:01.378
There's a chapter
on every woman he's killed.

36:04.920 --> 36:08.572
These entries are detailed enough
to let him relive the kills for years.

36:08.580 --> 36:10.992
He has candid photographs
of the victims at the park,

36:11.000 --> 36:13.241
grocery store, outside of church.

36:13.250 --> 36:15.115
Driver's license, clothing, jewelry.

36:15.120 --> 36:17.247
Those chapters in the back.
They're not finished.

36:17.250 --> 36:19.741
These photographs
are at least 20 years old.

36:19.750 --> 36:22.492
I mean, look at the hairstyles,
the clothing.

36:38.620 --> 36:41.373
His recent themes of communication
have been about "old friends,"

36:41.380 --> 36:42.495
"unfinished business."

36:42.500 --> 36:44.912
His car accident was in
the Fairmount district of Philadelphia.

36:44.920 --> 36:46.785
That's exactly where Carla Bromwell lived.

36:46.790 --> 36:48.826
He was on the way to kill her
when he had his accident.

36:48.830 --> 36:50.491
_ _ It's not about _ _
finding a new type of Victim.

36:50.500 --> 36:51.876
It's about a specific target.

36:51.880 --> 36:54.201
Because he was such a perfectionist,
and is a perfectionist,

36:54.210 --> 36:55.825
he had to finish
what he started years ago.

36:55.830 --> 36:57.661
Oh, these aren't new victims, Max.

36:57.670 --> 37:00.286
They were already targeted.
Right from day one.

37:00.290 --> 37:02.110
Who's in that last chapter?

37:06.000 --> 37:07.956
What's wrong with you, Walter?

37:08.380 --> 37:11.998
I've known you and Anne for years.
You're good people.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.786
Lay down on your back.

37:14.710 --> 37:17.031
Speak again and I will kill you.

37:28.960 --> 37:31.531
We believe Walter Kern
is in Sylvia Gooden's home now.

37:31.540 --> 37:33.667
Hotch confirmed he left
the community center hours ago

37:33.670 --> 37:35.240
and Kern's car's parked on the next block.

37:35.250 --> 37:36.786
I want Walter Kern alive.

37:36.790 --> 37:38.166
I'll stand by for the word.

37:38.170 --> 37:39.614
Good. Let's move out.

37:39.620 --> 37:42.282
-I'll call you when we've secured Kern.
-Yeah.

38:01.670 --> 38:04.958
Please don't.

38:04.960 --> 38:08.168
I need to do this. I can't stop it.

38:30.920 --> 38:33.161
No!No!No!

38:37.380 --> 38:39.280
No! No!

38:40.120 --> 38:41.667
It'll be over soon.

38:44.750 --> 38:47.036
Back up! Don't move!
Don't move! Don't move!

38:47.040 --> 38:48.917
-Get off her!
-Don't move! Don't move!

38:48.920 --> 38:50.740
On your knees! Down! Don't move!

38:50.750 --> 38:52.286
Ow! Watch my arm!

38:52.290 --> 38:53.746
Don't move!

38:53.750 --> 38:55.661
Watch it!

38:55.670 --> 38:56.876
Easy!
-You're going to be all right.

38:56.880 --> 38:58.700
-Just breathe deep. Take it easy.
-I'm not resisting.

38:58.710 --> 39:01.531
We got her. Sylvia Gooden's alive.
We got her.

39:01.540 --> 39:03.496
Gideon! I need your cuffs, man.

39:03.500 --> 39:06.412
You're going to be fine. It's over.
You're going to be fine.

39:06.420 --> 39:08.035
Why don't you do this?

39:09.120 --> 39:12.578
That's enough. Now get up.

39:12.580 --> 39:14.616
Up!
GIDEON: You're going to be okay.

39:14.620 --> 39:15.996
You're all right.

39:17.040 --> 39:21.488
Just breathe. Just breathe.
Just breathe. Just breathe.

39:32.750 --> 39:34.706
-You got him?
-Yeah, I got him.

39:35.250 --> 39:38.708
You know you've enjoyed this ride
as much as I have, Max.

39:38.710 --> 39:41.372
Well, I sure am enjoying this part of it.

39:42.920 --> 39:44.956
We are inseparable, you and me.

39:45.750 --> 39:50.244
Let's just test that theory, huh?
Get him out of here.

39:58.380 --> 40:00.416
Abraham Lincoln once said,

40:00.420 --> 40:03.321
"In the end, it's not the years
in your life that count.

40:03.330 --> 40:05.036
"It's the life in your years."

40:05.830 --> 40:07.536
Did Jason ever tell you about the time

40:07.540 --> 40:10.577
that he found the Director's itinerary
in a bomber's car?

40:10.580 --> 40:12.878
What -Max, come on. Come on.

40:12.880 --> 40:15.667
Well, let me fill you in, then.

40:15.670 --> 40:18.161
We had this bomber case.
It was one of Jason's first.

40:18.170 --> 40:20.741
So we had him go over
and search the bomber's car,

40:20.750 --> 40:22.911
which was in the Quantico garage.

40:23.330 --> 40:25.992
Except for me and the guys
had planted this piece of paper

40:26.000 --> 40:27.991
that had all these times and locations

40:28.000 --> 40:31.413
of where the FBI Director
was going to be over the next 48 hours.

40:31.420 --> 40:33.911
Aanay, Jason takes one look
at this piece of paper,

40:33.920 --> 40:36.320
and before we could stop him,
he takes off,

40:36.330 --> 40:39.743
runs up 25 flights of stairs
to the Director's office...

40:39.750 --> 40:40.956
Get out of here.

40:40.960 --> 40:44.168
...barges in, interrupting a meeting
with the Attorney General himself.

40:44.170 --> 40:45.239
Yeah, yeah!

40:46.210 --> 40:47.996
The Director didn't
find it very funny.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.537
And he was the only one who didn't.

40:51.250 --> 40:54.413
What else you got No family.

40:55.540 --> 40:56.700
Who's that?

40:57.790 --> 40:59.075
Ryan.

40:59.080 --> 41:02.322
I mean, technically he's retired,
but he hasn't seen his kids in years.

41:02.330 --> 41:04.787
Divorce is not uncommon in the BAU.

41:06.120 --> 41:09.499
You know the other night
when you called

41:09.500 --> 41:11.536
Did you think it was weird
that we all just

41:11.540 --> 41:14.418
were able to drop everything
and go to the office?

41:14.420 --> 41:18.413
That we're all available to you
anytime you call, day or night?

41:19.500 --> 41:22.572
-No, not really.
-How do you do it?

41:23.540 --> 41:29.490
How do you do this job
and still have a wife and a baby?

41:30.460 --> 41:35.238
Well, when I'm with them, I try
to focus 100% of my attention there.

41:36.330 --> 41:39.242
And then when I'm with you guys,
I try to do the same thing.

41:39.250 --> 41:43.163
It's about priorities, Elle. It's about
setting them and keeping them.

41:45.790 --> 41:48.998
I'm just so scared I'm going to
turn into that guy over there.

41:49.000 --> 41:51.491
Look up and see that
my life has passed me by

41:51.500 --> 41:53.456
while I was chasing monsters.

41:55.120 --> 41:58.533
It's hard.
This job will eat you up if you let it.

41:59.330 --> 42:00.661
So what do I do?

42:01.290 --> 42:03.417
Find a way not to let it.
