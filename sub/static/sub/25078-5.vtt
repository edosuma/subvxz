00:42.200 --> 00:46.330
A third of the land
on our planet is desert.

00:55.591 --> 00:58.678
These great scars
on the face of the Earth

00:58.803 --> 01:00.597
appear to be lifeless,

01:00.722 --> 01:03.851
but surprisingly none are.

01:10.400 --> 01:13.571
In all of them life manages somehow

01:13.654 --> 01:16.408
to keep a precarious hold.

01:37.433 --> 01:39.977
Not all deserts are hot.

01:40.395 --> 01:43.982
50 mile-an-hour winds
blowing in from Siberia

01:44.107 --> 01:48.154
bring snow to the Gobi Desert
in Mongolia.

02:14.018 --> 02:17.564
From a summer high
of 50 degrees centigrade

02:17.689 --> 02:21.777
the temperature in midwinter
can drop to minus 40,

02:21.903 --> 02:25.991
making this one
of the harshest deserts of all.

02:34.960 --> 02:40.049
Few animals can survive
these extreme changes.

02:46.432 --> 02:48.893
Wild Bactrian camels,

02:49.018 --> 02:51.646
one of the rarest mammals
on the planet.

02:51.772 --> 02:54.483
And perhaps the hardiest.

02:55.693 --> 02:58.238
Their biggest problem
is the lack of water,

02:58.363 --> 03:00.073
particularly now, in winter,

03:00.198 --> 03:03.619
when the little there is
is locked up as ice.

03:10.669 --> 03:14.841
Surprisingly, snow here never melts.

03:15.049 --> 03:19.847
The air is just too cold
and too dry for it to do so.

03:25.020 --> 03:28.774
The sun's rays turn it
straight into vapor.

03:28.858 --> 03:30.902
It evaporates.

03:38.911 --> 03:42.040
But it is the only source
of water,

03:42.123 --> 03:45.169
so Bactrian camels eat it.

03:46.045 --> 03:47.505
Elsewhere in the world

03:47.630 --> 03:54.221
a camel at a waterhole can drink
as much as 200 liters during a single visit.

03:56.182 --> 03:59.686
Here the strategy is to take little and often.

03:59.811 --> 04:01.230
And with good reason,

04:01.355 --> 04:05.109
for filling the stomach
with snow could be fatal.

04:10.658 --> 04:12.702
The camels must limit themselves

04:12.827 --> 04:16.790
to the equivalent
of just 10 liters a day.

04:33.393 --> 04:36.313
Winter is the time
for breeding.

04:40.944 --> 04:45.366
This extraordinary performance
is a male Bactrian camel's way

04:45.491 --> 04:48.953
of attracting the attention
of a passing female.

04:51.039 --> 04:55.544
In summer the camels can't stray
far from waterholes.

04:55.837 --> 04:59.382
But now, with mouthfuls
of snow lying everywhere

04:59.466 --> 05:02.887
they can travel widely
in search of mates.

05:06.975 --> 05:13.191
Today less than a thousand of these desert
specialists remain in the wild.

05:13.316 --> 05:18.822
The Gobi, hostile though it is,
is their last stronghold.

05:25.122 --> 05:28.459
There's no other desert
quite like the Gobi,

05:28.584 --> 05:31.713
but why is this place a desert?

05:33.006 --> 05:36.260
There is one simple
and massive cause -

05:36.385 --> 05:37.887
the Himalayas.

05:42.476 --> 05:46.606
Clouds blowing from the south
hit this gigantic barrier.

05:46.731 --> 05:48.149
As they're forced upwards

05:48.274 --> 05:51.695
so they empty their moisture
on the mountain slopes,

05:51.778 --> 05:55.616
leaving little for the land
on the other side.

06:00.163 --> 06:04.502
From the space
deserts are very conspicuous.

06:06.880 --> 06:11.844
Dunes of sand hundreds of miles long
streak their surface.

06:16.641 --> 06:19.812
With no cloak of vegetation
to conceal them

06:19.937 --> 06:24.609
strange formations are exposed
in the naked rock.

06:30.283 --> 06:34.204
Africa's Sahara is
the largest desert of all.

06:34.329 --> 06:36.665
It's the size
of the United States

06:36.749 --> 06:41.880
and the biggest source of sand
and dust in the entire world.

07:21.844 --> 07:25.223
Sandstorms like these
appear without warning

07:25.307 --> 07:30.355
and reduce visibility for days
over areas the size of Britain.

07:39.324 --> 07:45.080
Dromedaries, single-humped camels,
take these storms in their stride.

07:48.167 --> 07:52.756
The heaviest sand rises only
a few meters above the ground,

07:52.881 --> 07:58.305
but the dust can be blown
5,000 meters up into the sky.

08:03.352 --> 08:07.274
The ferocious wind,
armed with grains of sand,

08:07.399 --> 08:11.237
is the agent that shapes all deserts.

08:20.289 --> 08:27.339
Reptiles have armored scaly skins
that protect them from the stinging grains.

08:29.425 --> 08:34.556
For insects the bombardment
can be very severe indeed.

08:36.392 --> 08:39.604
The only escape
is below the surface.

08:56.624 --> 09:00.838
As the winds rise and fall, swallow and eddy

09:00.963 --> 09:04.509
so they pile the sand into dunes.

09:08.180 --> 09:12.351
These sand scenes can be
hundreds of miles across.

09:16.648 --> 09:21.529
In Namibia the winds have built
some of the biggest dunes in the world.

09:29.247 --> 09:33.502
Star dunes like these
can be 300 meters high.

09:33.585 --> 09:38.424
Grains, swept up the flanks,
are blown off the crests of the ridges

09:38.508 --> 09:41.261
so it's only the tops
that are moving.

09:48.144 --> 09:54.485
The main body of these dunes
may not have shifted for 5,000 years.

10:05.790 --> 10:12.298
Few rocks can resist the continuous
blast of the sand carrying wind.

10:12.465 --> 10:17.429
These outcrops are standing
in Egypt's White Desert.

10:17.805 --> 10:20.767
But they will not do so
for much longer.

10:22.268 --> 10:24.771
They're being inexorably
chiseled away

10:24.855 --> 10:27.942
and turned into more sand.

11:07.197 --> 11:14.581
Now lumps of heavily eroded rocks
have been marooned in a sea of sand.

11:31.560 --> 11:35.231
These jagged pyramids
a hundred meters tall

11:35.356 --> 11:38.985
were once part
of a continuous rocky plateau.

11:39.110 --> 11:43.741
The blasting sand will eventually
eliminate them altogether.

11:52.042 --> 11:58.550
The relentless power of the wind ensures
that the face of a desert is continually changing.

11:58.634 --> 12:02.054
But there is one constant presence -

12:09.855 --> 12:11.774
the desert sun.

12:26.417 --> 12:30.004
The sun's heat and power
to evaporate water

12:30.130 --> 12:36.304
has had a profound effect on the bodies
and habits of everything that lives here.

12:40.058 --> 12:43.604
This sun potentially is a killer.

12:44.939 --> 12:49.027
And the red kangaroos
must acknowledge that.

12:50.153 --> 12:52.406
Right now, while the sun is low,

12:52.531 --> 12:55.785
there's no immediate cause
for concern.

12:56.369 --> 12:59.581
But this situation won't last long.

13:00.374 --> 13:06.882
Australia is the world's most arid continent
with blistering daytime temperatures.

13:13.848 --> 13:19.939
Every hour the temperature rises
by five degrees centigrade.

13:26.530 --> 13:30.952
Soon the heat will reach
a critical point.

13:40.422 --> 13:46.638
Any kangaroo out in the open
is in serious danger of overheating.

13:52.103 --> 13:58.527
In the full sun the temperature
on the ground soars to 70 degrees.

14:02.782 --> 14:08.539
By midday the radiation is
so intense they must take shelter.

14:28.896 --> 14:32.526
In the shade they're shielded
from much of the sun's energy

14:32.651 --> 14:35.613
but their body temperature
can still rise.

14:38.324 --> 14:41.995
So they lick saliva
on to their forearms

14:42.079 --> 14:46.167
where there is a network of blood vessels
close to the surface of the skin

14:46.251 --> 14:50.965
and, as the saliva evaporates,
their blood is cooled.

14:53.593 --> 14:58.390
This thermal image shows
just how effective the process is.

14:58.515 --> 15:02.603
The blue areas on the body
are the cooler parts.

15:11.406 --> 15:15.202
As the saliva dries
it has to be replaced

15:15.327 --> 15:19.624
and this is a real drain
on the kangaroo's body fluids.

15:29.969 --> 15:33.933
Even in the shade
the earth is baking hot

15:34.558 --> 15:38.062
so the kangaroos dig away
the warmed topsoil

15:38.146 --> 15:41.400
to get at the cooler ground beneath.

16:03.968 --> 16:08.641
By staying in the shade and licking
to control their body temperature

16:08.766 --> 16:11.978
kangaroos manage to get
through the hottest part of the day

16:12.103 --> 16:13.730
without heat stroke.

16:14.690 --> 16:17.234
But for the majority
of desert animals

16:17.318 --> 16:20.822
this strategy would not be
enough for survival.

16:43.975 --> 16:48.981
The extraordinary ears
of the fennec foxes of Africa radiate heat

16:49.106 --> 16:52.568
but the animals have
another way of keeping cool.

17:02.205 --> 17:04.583
They spend their days underground

17:04.708 --> 17:07.752
and only emerge at sunset.

17:19.809 --> 17:23.188
Darkness brings huge changes.

17:23.313 --> 17:28.236
In the Sahara the temperature can drop
as much as 30 degrees during the night,

17:28.361 --> 17:33.117
so it's cool enough to allow
these desert fox cubs to play.

17:40.751 --> 17:43.379
All sorts of creatures now appear

17:43.504 --> 17:46.758
including some really unexpected ones.

17:49.720 --> 17:52.014
Toads have permeable skins

17:52.098 --> 17:56.102
and would quickly die from desiccation
out in the daytime heat.

17:56.186 --> 17:58.814
It's only now that
they can leave shelter.

18:01.818 --> 18:03.778
The same is true for scorpions,

18:03.903 --> 18:07.533
even though their shells
are actually watertight.

18:19.672 --> 18:23.594
In fact, most small desert
creatures are nocturnal.

18:23.719 --> 18:25.930
So it's only now
that you can judge

18:26.055 --> 18:29.309
just how much life
there can be in the desert.

18:30.227 --> 18:36.025
But moisture, lost even at night,
has to be replaced sometime somehow

18:36.150 --> 18:40.823
and that problem dominates
the lives of all desert dwellers.

18:49.041 --> 18:51.377
The Atacama in Chile.

18:51.460 --> 18:55.006
This is the driest desert
in the world.

18:56.633 --> 18:59.678
Some parts may not see rain
for fifty years

18:59.762 --> 19:01.139
and with such a record

19:01.222 --> 19:05.060
you'd expect the place
to be completely barren.

19:10.024 --> 19:14.404
These are South America's camels,
guanacos.

19:15.865 --> 19:18.201
They're very good
at conserving moisture

19:18.326 --> 19:21.705
but they nonetheless
need a regular supply of water.

19:34.720 --> 19:38.016
They get it partly
from cactus flowers

19:38.099 --> 19:41.770
but that explanation
raises another question.

19:44.023 --> 19:47.611
How do the cacti
survive without rain?

19:54.411 --> 19:59.750
Hot winds suck all the moisture
from the surface of the land.

20:01.127 --> 20:06.258
Clearly there must be something else
that takes the place of rain.

20:07.551 --> 20:13.600
The secret is a cold sea current
that runs parallel to the land.

20:30.579 --> 20:34.000
The cold water cools
the moist warm air above it

20:34.125 --> 20:37.170
and that produces banks of fog.

21:00.406 --> 21:07.581
At the same time wind blowing
on to the shore sweeps the fog inland.

21:22.391 --> 21:27.230
Before long the cacti
are dripping with dew.

21:35.740 --> 21:37.742
The fog is so regular

21:37.868 --> 21:41.455
that moisture loving lichens
are able to grow on the cacti

21:41.580 --> 21:44.918
and they absorb liquid
like a sponge.

21:47.379 --> 21:50.132
In the land of almost no rain

21:50.257 --> 21:56.056
these precious drops are life-savers
for many different creatures.

22:04.650 --> 22:10.615
Further inland the air remains so warm
that its moisture does not condense

22:10.698 --> 22:15.371
so this slender strip of desert
is virtually the only part of the Atacama

22:15.496 --> 22:17.540
where life can exist.

22:22.171 --> 22:23.631
Without the fog,

22:23.881 --> 22:26.592
this land, too, would be empty.

22:40.317 --> 22:43.529
The guanacos make
the most of the dew

22:43.655 --> 22:46.491
but it will not remain
for long.

22:47.200 --> 22:50.121
In an hour or two
the sun will have burnt it off

22:50.246 --> 22:52.832
and dry the surface of the cacti.

23:01.718 --> 23:07.224
The Sonoran desert in Arizona
is not quite so dry as the Atacama -

23:07.350 --> 23:09.561
some rain does fall.

23:10.395 --> 23:12.105
But it is infrequent

23:12.189 --> 23:13.690
and when it does arrive

23:13.774 --> 23:17.654
animals and plants have
to be ready to make the most of it.

23:19.114 --> 23:20.866
And it's coming.

23:29.543 --> 23:31.712
When the summer monsoon blows in

23:31.837 --> 23:35.383
the giant saguaros,
one of the biggest of all cacti,

23:35.466 --> 23:38.220
are ready to take
full advantage of it.

24:12.469 --> 24:19.144
After a rainstorm the saguaro's long shallow
root system sucks up the water

24:19.227 --> 24:24.317
and the pleats on its trunk
enable it to expand rapidly.

24:32.243 --> 24:37.666
When full, a saguaro stem can store
up to five tons of water

24:37.791 --> 24:42.296
and that's enough to see it
through many months of drought.

24:46.510 --> 24:52.225
The trunks of these huge plants
provide homes for the gila woodpecker.

24:54.269 --> 25:00.944
But birds are not the only animals
to benefit from the presence of the cacti.

25:17.297 --> 25:19.257
During four weeks of the summer

25:19.382 --> 25:25.056
the saguaros bloom at night
to attract visitors.

25:28.059 --> 25:31.355
The pollen and nectar
with which these flowers are loaded

25:31.480 --> 25:35.777
attract long-nosed and long-tongued bats.

25:51.003 --> 25:56.176
The bats left Mexico a few days earlier
to escape the heat of summer

25:56.301 --> 26:00.557
and are on their way north
to the southern United States.

26:02.392 --> 26:06.522
To get there, they have
to cross the Sonoran desert.

26:12.321 --> 26:14.448
But the desert is so big

26:14.573 --> 26:18.203
that for most of the year
they would be unable to cross it.

26:18.328 --> 26:20.706
Now, with the saguaro in bloom,

26:20.831 --> 26:23.626
they can refuel on the way.

26:33.471 --> 26:37.476
So the saguaro's success
in developing a way to store water

26:37.601 --> 26:45.402
is now crucial to most of the animals
that live or even travel through this land.

27:24.198 --> 27:28.912
The scarcity of rain determined
the shape of this icon of the desert

27:29.037 --> 27:31.081
but water, scarce thought it is,

27:31.207 --> 27:35.378
has also, like the wind,
shaped the land itself.

27:52.565 --> 27:54.443
In the deserts of Utah

27:54.568 --> 28:00.283
ancient rivers flowing across sandstone country
steadily widen their canyons

28:00.408 --> 28:06.833
until now the land between them
has been reduced to spires and pinnacles.

28:36.451 --> 28:41.708
With little or no soil to retain
the water on the surface of the land

28:41.833 --> 28:44.961
life here is scarce indeed.

28:46.588 --> 28:48.632
And when resources are limited,

28:48.758 --> 28:51.344
conflict is never far away.

29:01.982 --> 29:04.693
These are Nubian ibex

29:04.818 --> 29:07.613
and they are squaring up
for a duel.

29:13.871 --> 29:15.331
And when trouble starts,

29:15.456 --> 29:20.963
a smart ibex knows that the best thing
to do is to gain higher ground.

29:38.317 --> 29:41.612
These are actually
subordinate male ibex,

29:41.738 --> 29:44.241
but their fights
are nonetheless serious.

29:44.324 --> 29:49.580
Losing one might mean
never getting the chance to breed ever.

30:11.940 --> 30:15.486
When competitors are evenly
matched as they are here,

30:15.611 --> 30:18.615
duels can last for an hour.

30:38.430 --> 30:42.769
In this heat the effort
is truly exhausting.

30:44.604 --> 30:51.112
But victory here will gain important
ranking points on a male's way to the top.

31:22.400 --> 31:24.068
There's so much at stake

31:24.193 --> 31:26.488
that not all play fair.

31:41.756 --> 31:44.176
The battle has produced the winner,

31:44.301 --> 31:48.347
but the ultimate prize
is not his yet.

31:51.810 --> 31:56.107
That currently belongs
to the dominant male ibex.

31:58.276 --> 32:02.364
His rank earns him the loyalty
of a harem of females

32:02.489 --> 32:06.119
and they follow him closely
as he travels across this desert

32:06.244 --> 32:08.413
searching for food and water.

32:10.582 --> 32:13.669
He doesn't have to waste time
looking for mates -

32:13.794 --> 32:15.380
they're his for the taking,

32:15.505 --> 32:20.386
so he can concentrate with them
on keeping fit and healthy.

32:35.737 --> 32:38.824
Lizards are desert specialists.

32:41.911 --> 32:45.749
But here, their numbers
are extraordinary.

32:51.172 --> 32:57.430
These crevices in South Africa contain
the highest density of lizards in the world.

33:07.275 --> 33:10.946
They're called flat lizards
for obvious reasons,

33:11.071 --> 33:16.077
and they flaunt their multi-colored
bellies in territorial disputes.

33:18.538 --> 33:20.040
He's made his point,

33:20.165 --> 33:23.086
and now it's time
to find some food.

33:24.921 --> 33:26.465
As the day warms up,

33:26.590 --> 33:28.842
the lizards move away
from their cracks

33:28.968 --> 33:31.637
and head down
to the bottom of the gorge.

33:32.889 --> 33:35.100
Their goal is the river.

33:37.519 --> 33:39.939
There is no food at the edge,

33:40.064 --> 33:43.777
but this desert river
holds a secret.

33:50.285 --> 33:55.833
Each day blackfly rise
from turbulent stretches of the river.

33:55.916 --> 33:58.795
This is what the lizards
have come for.

34:13.938 --> 34:16.065
The black fly never land,

34:16.190 --> 34:19.862
so the lizards have to leap
for their food.

34:32.126 --> 34:38.551
In one day each of these acrobatic
little lizards may catch 50 flies.

34:48.730 --> 34:51.065
There are plenty of flies
to go round,

34:51.190 --> 34:54.652
even with hundreds of lizards
competing for them.

35:08.545 --> 35:14.802
Away from these rapids flat lizard populations
are found in much smaller numbers.

35:14.928 --> 35:19.934
But here one unusual abundance
has produced another.

35:30.988 --> 35:33.992
Deserts are created by the lack of water,

35:34.117 --> 35:38.414
but what actually kills animals
here is not heat or thirst,

35:38.539 --> 35:40.500
but lack of food.

35:58.938 --> 36:03.068
So how on earth does
a plant-eater this size

36:03.194 --> 36:08.992
survive in a place apparently
totally devoid of vegetation?

36:15.250 --> 36:19.380
Elephants in Namibia
are the toughest in Africa.

36:19.505 --> 36:21.465
And they need to be.

36:38.569 --> 36:41.823
What little food exists
is so dispersed

36:41.948 --> 36:44.994
that these elephants walk
up to 50 miles a day

36:45.119 --> 36:50.876
as they travel up the dry river channels
searching for something to eat.

37:05.560 --> 37:09.815
At times the task
looks truly helpless.

37:44.565 --> 37:48.319
Elephants may seem out of place
in this landscape,

37:48.444 --> 37:51.114
but they're not the only ones.

38:07.551 --> 38:11.305
Amazingly, lions live here, too.

38:15.852 --> 38:19.940
In savannah country huge herds
of games support prides

38:20.066 --> 38:22.652
containing 20 lions or more.

38:22.777 --> 38:26.657
But to live here
lions have had to change their habits -

38:26.782 --> 38:28.492
prides are much smaller

38:28.617 --> 38:31.663
and their home ranges
are very much bigger.

38:32.664 --> 38:35.125
And there's an added problem -

38:36.460 --> 38:40.048
their food is always on the move.

38:48.683 --> 38:50.101
Like the elephants,

38:50.227 --> 38:55.191
the lions must travel great distances
to find enough to live on.

39:10.417 --> 39:13.212
But lions can't go everywhere -

39:13.338 --> 39:17.676
they won't attempt to cross
this field of sand dunes

39:17.801 --> 39:19.720
and the oryx know it.

40:19.667 --> 40:23.755
The lions must wait for the oryx
to leave the safety of the dunes,

40:23.880 --> 40:26.842
which eventually they must
to find food and water.

40:26.967 --> 40:29.428
And then the lions
will ambush them.

41:35.215 --> 41:39.637
The elephants have found
some of their favorite food.

41:46.229 --> 41:49.274
Grasses are the staple diet
of all elephants,

41:49.399 --> 41:52.778
but this herd concentrates
on digging up the roots,

41:52.903 --> 41:57.033
which have more nutrition
and moisture than the stems.

41:57.158 --> 41:58.577
It's the sort of behavior

41:58.702 --> 42:02.915
that can make all the difference
in a place of serious shortages.

42:03.624 --> 42:07.421
Yet all this can change
in an instant.

42:24.566 --> 42:29.363
The fortunes of many deserts
are ruled by distant rains.

42:29.489 --> 42:34.870
This water fell as rain
in mountains more than a hundred miles away.

42:40.377 --> 42:42.254
It's known as a flash flood

42:42.379 --> 42:46.718
and called that because the water
may run for just a single day.

42:46.843 --> 42:51.557
It's an event that only happens
once or twice a year at the most.

43:12.373 --> 43:16.795
The sandy riverbed acts like
a giant strip of blotting paper

43:16.920 --> 43:20.216
sucking up the water
as soon as it appears.

43:29.727 --> 43:33.190
But every square meter of soil
moistened by this river

43:33.315 --> 43:37.820
will increase the chances
of survival for those that live here.

43:43.452 --> 43:46.831
Waterholes are filled
temporarily.

43:51.503 --> 43:55.008
Elsewhere in Africa
elephants drink every day,

43:55.133 --> 43:56.676
but the lack of water here

43:56.801 --> 44:03.518
means that desert elephants can only
refill their tanks once every four or five days.

44:04.644 --> 44:08.941
Within a week the flash flood
has produced a flush of green,

44:09.066 --> 44:13.363
more than enough to draw
the oryx out of the dunes.

44:15.240 --> 44:19.328
It's a rare chance for them
to build up their food reserves.

44:27.964 --> 44:32.511
The flood has made life easier
for the lions, too.

44:34.889 --> 44:39.978
The flesh of this oryx will keep
the family going for a week at the most.

44:40.103 --> 44:42.564
But for a while
the hunting will be easier,

44:42.690 --> 44:45.818
now that river channel
has turned green.

44:49.781 --> 44:52.618
The good times
for lions and oryx are brief,

44:52.785 --> 44:54.787
but these are the short moments

44:54.912 --> 44:59.042
that make it possible to live
in deserts the year round.

45:04.799 --> 45:07.886
Death Valley is the hottest
place on Earth.

45:08.011 --> 45:12.267
Yet even this furnace
can be transformed by water.

45:22.863 --> 45:27.910
A single shower can enable seeds
that have lain dormant for 30 years or more

45:28.035 --> 45:30.163
to burst into life.

45:38.548 --> 45:42.970
And there hasn't been a bloom
like this one for a century.

45:55.193 --> 45:58.864
The periods of boom
in Death Valley are short.

45:58.989 --> 46:03.244
But they're just frequent enough
to keep life ticking over.

46:11.796 --> 46:16.427
A sudden flush of vegetation is
what every desert dweller waits for,

46:16.552 --> 46:19.847
and when it happens
they must make the most of it.

46:40.330 --> 46:42.666
There is no other species
on the planet

46:42.791 --> 46:49.758
that responds as quickly and as dramatically
to the good times as the desert locust.

46:50.092 --> 46:55.223
Eggs that have remained in the ground
for 20 years begin to hatch.

47:07.863 --> 47:09.991
The young locusts
are known as hoppers,

47:10.116 --> 47:12.452
for at this stage
they're flightless.

47:12.702 --> 47:19.293
They find new feeding grounds
by following the smell of sprouting grass.

47:25.134 --> 47:29.097
Normally it takes four weeks
for hoppers to become adults,

47:29.222 --> 47:31.725
but when the conditions
are right as now

47:31.850 --> 47:35.605
their development switches
to the fast track.

47:40.611 --> 47:43.823
As the vegetation in one place
begins to run out

47:43.948 --> 47:47.494
the winged adults release pheromones -
scent messages,

47:47.619 --> 47:51.165
which tell others in the group
that they must move on.

48:03.137 --> 48:04.723
And when groups merge,

48:04.848 --> 48:07.101
they form a swarm.

48:29.711 --> 48:33.841
An adult locust eats
its entire body weight every day,

48:33.966 --> 48:39.514
and a whole swarm can consume
literally hundreds of tons of vegetation.

48:41.058 --> 48:43.352
They have to keep on moving.

48:44.812 --> 48:47.023
The swarm travels
with the wind -

48:47.107 --> 48:50.527
it's the most energy-saving
way of flying.

48:54.115 --> 48:59.663
Following the flow of wind means that they're
always heading toward areas of low pressure,

48:59.789 --> 49:05.170
places where wind meets rain
and vegetation starts to grow.

49:07.089 --> 49:08.090
As they fly,

49:08.215 --> 49:10.885
swarms join up with other swarms

49:11.010 --> 49:14.973
to form gigantнннic plagues
several billions strong

49:15.098 --> 49:17.643
and as much as 40 miles wide.

49:19.687 --> 49:24.276
They will consume every edible thing
that lies in their path.

49:37.625 --> 49:41.797
This is one of planet Earth's
greatest spectacles.

49:41.922 --> 49:43.883
It's rarely seen on this scale

49:44.008 --> 49:46.052
and it won't last long.

49:46.177 --> 49:47.846
Once the food is gone,

49:47.971 --> 49:53.895
the steady roar of a billion beating
locust wings will once again be replaced

49:54.020 --> 49:58.692
by nothing more
than the sound of the desert wind.
