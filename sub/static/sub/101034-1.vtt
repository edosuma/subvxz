07:24.930 --> 07:28.200

08:57.900 --> 08:59.023
just gotta break him in a little bit.

08:59.023 --> 09:00.053

09:29.440 --> 09:30.853
- [Chad] Couldn't do any worse than that.

09:30.853 --> 09:32.127

She's good, she's just

11:37.420 --> 11:38.790
- Looks like someone had a good night.

11:38.790 --> 11:40.093
- She's such a slut.

11:43.188 --> 11:45.855
(ominous music)

11:55.960 --> 11:57.763
- [Maggie] So you don't remember anything?

11:59.340 --> 12:00.173
- Nothing.

12:01.527 --> 12:03.103
I wasn't even drunk.

12:04.960 --> 12:07.433
I had like two beers and then,

12:09.800 --> 12:10.980

12:10.980 --> 12:11.863

12:12.999 --> 12:14.243
- Two nights ago.

12:23.053 --> 12:23.886

12:32.950 --> 12:35.683
it was that one guy, Keegan.

12:37.085 --> 12:38.503
The quarterback.

12:42.450 --> 12:44.763
- And you're sure you
don't wanna go to the cops?

12:46.360 --> 12:47.610
- What are they gonna do?

12:49.560 --> 12:50.393
I don't...

12:51.720 --> 12:53.933
Remember anything.

12:56.420 --> 12:58.480
I'm just gonna be another drunk girl

12:58.480 --> 13:00.690

13:08.832 --> 13:10.700
they don't get in trouble.

13:13.152 --> 13:16.378
- Guys like this, they haven't met us.

14:10.800 --> 14:13.590
This is Maggie's cousin
we're talkin' about.

14:13.590 --> 14:15.920
Are we gonna let her handle
this shit on her own?

14:15.920 --> 14:17.300
Or are we gonna fight with our sister?

14:17.300 --> 14:19.760
- [All] Defend our sister!

14:19.760 --> 14:21.750
- That's what I wanna fuckin' here.

14:21.750 --> 14:22.830
These preppy fucks.

14:22.830 --> 14:27.633
They think that they can
take, and take, and take!

14:28.823 --> 14:30.120
Well let's see if they can take

14:30.120 --> 14:31.410

15:38.850 --> 15:41.600
- Round of shots for everyone in leather.

15:41.600 --> 15:43.793
We like whiskey and we ain't fancy.

15:45.180 --> 15:48.080
- Look at these dykes
with all that leather,

15:48.080 --> 15:50.400
they shoulda stayed in the closet.

15:50.400 --> 15:51.740

16:02.090 --> 16:04.460
Oh, yeah, well, you are

16:04.460 --> 16:07.889
Must be why you're such a little dick.

16:07.889 --> 16:09.510
Get the fuck up.

16:09.510 --> 16:11.750
That wasn't very nice now, was it, huh?

- [Bartender] Come on, ladies,

16:16.510 --> 16:17.872
take it outside.
(bikers loudly shouting)

16:17.872 --> 16:18.705
- Enough.

16:20.750 --> 16:22.950
He musta tripped and fell.

16:22.950 --> 16:24.170
You got a real slippery floor,

16:24.170 --> 16:26.023
you wanna put a sign up for that?

16:27.510 --> 16:28.360
Right, Nona?

16:28.360 --> 16:32.003
- Yeah, (softly chuckles) just dangerous.

16:33.490 --> 16:34.323
- Yeah.

16:35.220 --> 16:36.993
Escort this gentleman out the bar.

16:38.140 --> 16:39.340
Run along now, princess.

16:51.600 --> 16:52.433
You Mary?

16:53.690 --> 16:55.543
- It's fine, she doesn't bite.

16:56.730 --> 16:57.763
- That is a lie.

16:58.710 --> 16:59.543
You all right?

17:01.250 --> 17:02.083
- Yeah, fine.

17:04.119 --> 17:05.670
- It's all right if you're not.

17:09.109 --> 17:09.967
I'm Trigga.

17:12.925 --> 17:13.758
- Mary.

17:31.577 --> 17:32.410
- That's them?

17:33.704 --> 17:36.180
All right, let's get
her outta here, come on.

17:36.180 --> 17:37.830
Nona can handle these boys, okay?

17:49.799 --> 17:51.433
- [Biker Girl] Hey,
what's up, how are you?

17:51.433 --> 17:52.266
- Hello.
- Hi.

17:52.266 --> 17:53.610
- [Biker Girl] Sorry, (softly chuckles)

17:53.610 --> 17:56.410
I see you're panthers, you're
football players, or what?

18:10.027 --> 18:11.603
- Hey, man, beer, please.

18:15.780 --> 18:16.830
- Buy a girl a drink?

18:18.530 --> 18:19.580
- Uh...

18:21.100 --> 18:21.970
- Yeah, yeah--
- Yeah--

18:21.970 --> 18:23.660
- I'll take that as a yes.

18:23.660 --> 18:24.553
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.320
My name's Maggie, you would be?

18:29.320 --> 18:30.483
- I'm sorry, I'm Brian.

18:32.320 --> 18:34.850
You're Maggie, like the cartoon, Maggie.

18:34.850 --> 18:36.970
- No, no, like Maggie, like my name

18:36.970 --> 18:38.520
is just fucking Maggie, Maggie.

18:39.910 --> 18:42.173
You gonna get me that drink?

18:42.173 --> 18:44.993
- Yeah, one more beer, please.

18:47.510 --> 18:48.343
Thank you.

18:50.572 --> 18:51.750
- Wanna go hang out with your friends?

18:51.750 --> 18:53.233
- No, no, no, no, please, no.

18:54.880 --> 18:56.290
They're not my friends.

18:56.290 --> 18:58.160
- Those guys right there
in the exact same shirts,

18:58.160 --> 18:58.993
they're not your friends?

18:58.993 --> 18:59.826
- Yeah, no, they're not my friends.

18:59.826 --> 19:02.560
We're just in the football
team, but that's about it.

19:02.560 --> 19:04.870
I barely even talk to them.

19:04.870 --> 19:05.703
- Huh.

19:07.150 --> 19:08.443
- Where are you from?

19:09.730 --> 19:13.960
- I am from the other side of the river.

19:13.960 --> 19:14.793
- Me too.

19:16.800 --> 19:18.103
- Really?
- Yeah.

19:21.432 --> 19:23.633
- What are you doing here?

19:24.870 --> 19:26.160
- Well, you know that saying,

19:26.160 --> 19:28.060
do something that scares you everyday?

19:31.440 --> 19:32.893
- Yeah, yeah, I do.

19:38.191 --> 19:39.592
- So you're a freshman?

19:39.592 --> 19:40.425
- Yeah.

19:41.875 --> 19:43.423
Off to a great start.

19:46.260 --> 19:48.660
I take it you didn't do
the whole college thing.

19:49.640 --> 19:50.640
- I never needed to.

19:51.759 --> 19:53.890
Worked at my dad's bike
shop when I was a kid,

19:53.890 --> 19:54.893
I always had a job.

19:57.170 --> 19:59.083
- My first job was at a froyo stand.

20:00.260 --> 20:02.073
- Nothin' wrong with that.

20:02.073 --> 20:03.693
Fuckin' love froyo.

20:07.420 --> 20:08.253
- So did I.

20:09.683 --> 20:11.933
- Gettin' behind the
curtain ruin it for you?

20:13.810 --> 20:15.303
- Creeper of a boss.

20:16.870 --> 20:18.763
- Same shit at the bike shop.

20:20.100 --> 20:22.843
- No way, people gave you shit?

20:25.660 --> 20:27.193
- I wasn't always like this.

20:29.240 --> 20:30.640
My daddy used to hire these guys

20:30.640 --> 20:32.813
to come in during the
summer to help him out.

20:35.257 --> 20:36.793
They were relentless.

20:38.700 --> 20:39.913
But I took care of them.

20:41.340 --> 20:44.713
Once my dad was gone, shop was mine.

20:47.870 --> 20:49.433
- Did he pass away?

20:51.630 --> 20:52.580
- Moved to Florida.

20:53.485 --> 20:56.652
(both softly chuckle)

20:59.989 --> 21:01.763
- So you own a bike shop,

21:03.040 --> 21:04.819
that's how all this started?

21:04.819 --> 21:06.851
- You mean the gang?

21:06.851 --> 21:07.684
Kinda.

21:09.900 --> 21:11.913
Some girls came to me in a tough spot.

21:13.007 --> 21:14.143
Needed some help.

21:16.080 --> 21:18.990
We're a bunch of bitches
with some shit in common.

21:18.990 --> 21:19.823
- What's that?

21:21.390 --> 21:23.603
- Same shit you have
in common with us now.

21:29.660 --> 21:31.890
- So you go where you're needed.

21:31.890 --> 21:32.990
- Something like that.

21:35.700 --> 21:37.000
- You're like superheroes.

21:38.166 --> 21:40.263
- We're pretty fuckin' far from heroes.

21:43.477 --> 21:48.477
(muffled rock music)
(patrons loudly cheering)

21:50.560 --> 21:51.973
- You enjoy football?

21:53.030 --> 21:53.933
- I guess,

21:55.350 --> 21:56.283
first year,

21:57.210 --> 21:59.393
this point I'm just doin' it
for the scholarship, you know?

21:59.393 --> 22:00.610
- Oh, what, you don't
wanna be in crippling debt

22:00.610 --> 22:01.470
like the rest of us?

22:01.470 --> 22:04.850
- Listen, I have my whole
life to be in crippling debt.

22:04.850 --> 22:05.853
I'm a lit major.

22:07.790 --> 22:09.950
- You look a little old to be a freshman.

22:09.950 --> 22:14.423
- Yeah, there might have
been a gap year, or two.

22:16.780 --> 22:18.113
Mom got sick so,

22:19.026 --> 22:20.930
had to take care of her.
- Wait until

22:20.930 --> 22:22.447
she got better and then--

22:24.232 --> 22:25.065
- No.

22:27.040 --> 22:28.057
- Oh, I'm...

22:29.740 --> 22:30.853
Shit, I'm sorry, I--

22:30.853 --> 22:32.293
- It's fine, it's fine.

22:37.120 --> 22:40.300
- Actually, the same thing
happened to me when I was 15.

22:43.640 --> 22:47.347
And then I found these girls and now,

22:48.780 --> 22:49.843
they're my family.

22:51.130 --> 22:54.610
- Well, least you have someone.

22:54.610 --> 22:57.060
- I mean, you have these amazing,

22:57.060 --> 22:58.646
amazing fellas, they're just

22:58.646 --> 23:00.090
(tongue softly clicks)
- Oh, yes, yeah, yeah,

23:00.090 --> 23:01.180
frat stars.
- Keepers.

23:01.180 --> 23:03.630
- Too fabulous.
(Maggie softly laughs)

23:03.630 --> 23:06.945
Yeah, no thanks.

23:06.945 --> 23:07.840
- Are you sure, 'cause we can go--

23:07.840 --> 23:11.327
- I'm positive, I am--
- Sing, and, hey.

23:11.327 --> 23:12.837
- Hey, we're gonna really
get the party started,

23:12.837 --> 23:14.763
you're ready to party, right?

23:15.960 --> 23:17.974
- Yeah--
- We will be ready.

23:17.974 --> 23:18.974
- All right.

23:20.215 --> 23:21.453
That is for you.

23:23.290 --> 23:24.411
- Thank you.

23:24.411 --> 23:26.153
- We got some horny ones tonight, huh?

23:26.153 --> 23:27.393
- Fuck yeah.
(women softly howl)

23:27.393 --> 23:28.522
- I gotta go.
- What?

23:28.522 --> 23:30.972
She just, spot the good stuff.

23:30.972 --> 23:32.680
- I just think it's a better idea

23:32.680 --> 23:34.370
that you go right now.

23:36.883 --> 23:40.680
This is my number--
- Are you, are you kidding me?

23:40.680 --> 23:42.530
- No, not at all, you should call me.

23:44.320 --> 23:45.153
- Okay.
- Let's get this

23:45.153 --> 23:46.193
after party started!

23:46.193 --> 23:48.247
(softly howling)
- Hell yeah!

23:48.247 --> 23:51.414
(all loudly howling)

23:52.554 --> 23:54.186
Let's get 'em, bitches!

23:54.186 --> 23:57.853
(crowd hooting and howling)

24:01.161 --> 24:03.661
- [Biker Girl] Down the hatch!

24:06.913 --> 24:11.913
(muffled hard rock music)
(crowd softly hooting)

24:35.190 --> 24:37.100
- Where's our fourth one at?

24:37.100 --> 24:39.743
- He had nothing to do with it, I checked.

24:42.349 --> 24:43.623
- It's not your call to make.

24:44.511 --> 24:48.440
- Trig, I checked, he had
absolutely nothing to do with it.

24:49.850 --> 24:51.500
- It's still not your call, babe.

24:57.072 --> 24:59.739
(ominous music)

25:31.760 --> 25:33.093
Mary, come here.

25:36.178 --> 25:37.345
Should be you.

25:39.650 --> 25:40.483
You should have the honor

25:40.483 --> 25:43.400
of kickin' this thing off, come on.

25:50.812 --> 25:53.562
- [Mary] I just pull the trigger?

25:54.478 --> 25:59.145
- You just pull that trigger,
and we'll handle the rest.

26:01.396 --> 26:03.093
(gun loudly fires)

26:03.093 --> 26:04.044
- [Chad] What the fuck?

26:04.044 --> 26:04.877
- [Nona] That's fuckin' right!

26:04.877 --> 26:06.460
- [Biker] Get down there, come on.

26:06.460 --> 26:08.658
- [Nona] Stay the fuck down, you whore!

26:08.658 --> 26:12.241
(bikers softly snickering)

26:13.726 --> 26:15.888
- [Keegan] What the fuck?

26:15.888 --> 26:16.787
Fuck.
- Get here, fuck,

26:16.787 --> 26:17.620
gonna get it on.

26:19.181 --> 26:20.059
- [Tanner] What the fuck--

26:20.059 --> 26:24.447
- [Nona] Shut your
fuckin' mouth, cum stain!

26:24.447 --> 26:26.595
- [Biker] Cum stain.

26:26.595 --> 26:28.852
(bikers softly snickering)

26:28.852 --> 26:29.685
- Fuck.
- Get here,

26:29.685 --> 26:30.518
fuck, gonna get it on.

26:30.518 --> 26:32.200
- You fuckin' pieces of shit

26:33.150 --> 26:35.860
should consider yourselves
real fuckin' lucky.

26:35.860 --> 26:37.170
- What the fuck?

26:37.170 --> 26:39.008
- [Maggie] Keep your mouth shut.

26:39.008 --> 26:42.520
- 'Cause I mighta just killed ya.

26:42.520 --> 26:45.520
You have the one that you
victimized to thank for that.

26:45.520 --> 26:48.909
(ominous music)

26:48.909 --> 26:51.490
(bikers softly snickering)

26:51.490 --> 26:54.107
Yeah, it's all coming
back to you now, huh?

26:54.107 --> 26:56.118
- Look, look, I don't know what she told--

26:56.118 --> 26:56.951
(loudly thuds)

26:56.951 --> 27:00.289
- [Trigga] See, our girls here
don't really like bullshit.

27:00.289 --> 27:02.740
So you better keep your
fuckin' mouth shut.

27:02.740 --> 27:06.242
(Keegan softly groaning)

27:06.242 --> 27:08.731
- What the fuck is goin' on?

27:08.731 --> 27:11.481
(chilling music)

27:12.700 --> 27:14.523
- Maybe it's better this way though.

27:16.110 --> 27:18.810
Maybe this way you'll have
something to remember.

27:18.810 --> 27:20.150
Next time you see a girl at one

27:20.150 --> 27:22.640
of your lame-ass parties or in a bar,

27:22.640 --> 27:23.913
that you think is weak,

27:26.780 --> 27:28.930
well, you'll remember tonight.

27:28.930 --> 27:30.263
You'll remember the pain.

27:36.140 --> 27:37.820
In the spirit of generosity,

27:37.820 --> 27:40.773
I'm gonna give you guys
a little head start.

27:42.050 --> 27:43.573
Five seconds oughta do it.

27:44.569 --> 27:45.402
Four,

27:49.304 --> 27:50.137
three,

27:55.220 --> 27:56.053
two.

27:59.220 --> 28:02.102
You boys thought you were gonna
have some fun tonight, huh?

28:02.102 --> 28:03.104
- [Keegan] You're fuckin' crazy!

28:03.104 --> 28:05.483
- (loudly cackling) You got that right!

28:09.898 --> 28:14.898
(skin softly sizzling)
(Chad loudly screams)

28:16.036 --> 28:18.860
(skin softly sizzling)
(Tanner loudly grunts

28:18.860 --> 28:20.110
- [Keegan] What the fuck?

28:22.090 --> 28:24.443
- [Trigga] This one's all yours, Mary.

28:27.577 --> 28:31.703
- You fucking bitch, you
fuckin' lying-- (softly groans)

28:31.703 --> 28:36.079
(skin softly sizzling)
(Keegan loudly screaming)

28:36.079 --> 28:38.246
- [Trigga] That's my girl!

28:39.100 --> 28:42.433
(bikers loudly howling)

28:46.594 --> 28:47.427
Dark Moon!

28:50.192 --> 28:55.192
(engines softly rustling)
(ominous music)

29:06.526 --> 29:07.657
- [Maggie] He's a fucking bleeder, man.

29:07.657 --> 29:09.486
- He's a fuckin' squealer too.

29:09.486 --> 29:10.640
- That was so hot.
- How about that?

29:10.640 --> 29:11.996
That get your blood pumpin', or what?

29:11.996 --> 29:14.373
- I mean, it always does,
fuck, it's been so long.

29:14.373 --> 29:16.620
- I can't wait to see
them shit their J-Crews

29:16.620 --> 29:18.220
when we go back for the next round.

29:18.220 --> 29:19.560
Gotta get the fourth one too, right?

29:19.560 --> 29:21.844
- Trigg, we got 'em,
why are we going back?

29:21.844 --> 29:23.397
- Come on.

29:23.397 --> 29:26.529
- [Nona] Mary, so what'd you
think of your first ride?

29:26.529 --> 29:28.393
- She liked it, didn't you, Mary?

29:29.523 --> 29:30.475
- [Mary] I fuckin' loved it.

29:30.475 --> 29:31.723
- How'd it make you feel?

29:31.723 --> 29:32.728
- [Mary] Great.

29:32.728 --> 29:34.840
- Nah, come on, I want more than that.

29:34.840 --> 29:36.467
How'd it really fuckin' make you feel?

29:36.467 --> 29:38.870
- It made me feel amazing.

29:38.870 --> 29:40.323
It made me feel right!

29:40.323 --> 29:41.156
- [Trigga] Yeah?

29:41.156 --> 29:42.750
- Like I'm done putting
up with their shit.

29:42.750 --> 29:45.167
- [Trigga] That's more like it, what shit?

29:45.167 --> 29:47.317
- "Don't wear that, Mary,
you'll look like a slut!"

29:47.317 --> 29:48.447
"Don't be a prude, Mary."

29:48.447 --> 29:50.057
"Oh, it's just a phase, Mary."

29:50.057 --> 29:52.480
"Smile, smile, smile!"

29:52.480 --> 29:53.820
- [Trigga] Who are you fucking done with?

29:53.820 --> 29:57.200
- All of them, every last
one of these assholes!

29:57.200 --> 29:59.720
The pickup lines, the ass grabs!

29:59.720 --> 30:00.864
- Fuck that!

30:00.864 --> 30:02.900
- [All] Fuck that!

30:02.900 --> 30:04.350
- What are you gonna do about it?

30:04.350 --> 30:05.620
- They wanna hurt me?

30:05.620 --> 30:07.420
I'd like to see them try.

30:07.420 --> 30:09.580
I'm gonna make them bleed!

30:09.580 --> 30:11.756
- What do we say to that, Dark Moon?

30:11.756 --> 30:13.186
- [All] Fuck yeah!

30:13.186 --> 30:16.026
- Yeah, that's fuckin' right!

30:16.026 --> 30:16.986
You want in?

30:16.986 --> 30:18.230
- [Mary] Fuck, yeah.

30:18.230 --> 30:19.734
- You know what that means, ladies.

30:19.734 --> 30:21.197
(bikers loudly cheering)

30:21.197 --> 30:24.390
- [All] Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary!

30:24.390 --> 30:25.307
Mary, Mary!

30:26.246 --> 30:27.663
Mary, Mary, Mary!

30:28.786 --> 30:32.369
(students softly laughing)

30:33.863 --> 30:38.863
- Oh my god.
(chattering and giggling)

30:42.921 --> 30:45.948
- Get the fuck up, get the fuck up.

30:45.948 --> 30:47.031
- Guys, guys,

30:51.047 --> 30:52.420
all right, show's over,

30:52.420 --> 30:54.643
everybody back to class now, goddammit.

30:59.168 --> 31:02.480
(locker loudly slams)

31:02.480 --> 31:04.190
I hope that's the last time I have

31:04.190 --> 31:06.750
to make you fuckers run after practice.

31:06.750 --> 31:07.850
What the hell's wrong with you?

31:07.850 --> 31:11.170
- Well, we had a long
night last night, Coach.

31:11.170 --> 31:12.003
You know how it goes.

31:12.003 --> 31:12.836
- Yeah, I know how it goes.

31:12.836 --> 31:14.136
I never let it get in the way of my game

31:14.136 --> 31:16.200
and I expect the same outta you.

31:16.200 --> 31:17.070
- Yes, sir.

31:17.070 --> 31:17.903
- What was that?

31:17.903 --> 31:18.950
- I said, yes, sir, Coach.

31:18.950 --> 31:22.259
- Good, 'cause we're tryin'
to win a fuckin' championship

31:22.259 --> 31:25.410
and if you guys fuck it up
for the rest of the team,

31:25.410 --> 31:26.283
you're gonna pay.

31:31.333 --> 31:34.091
(locker loudly slams)

31:34.091 --> 31:35.744
- Fuckin' burn!

31:35.744 --> 31:37.860
- Think mine's infected.

31:37.860 --> 31:40.080
I need to see a doctor.

31:40.080 --> 31:40.913
- Yeah?

31:40.913 --> 31:43.433
And have everybody read
Suck My Pussy on your ass?

31:44.810 --> 31:45.643
Fuck!

31:46.599 --> 31:49.693
All from that stupid
little bitch at that party.

31:49.693 --> 31:51.910
Wasn't even a good fuck.

31:51.910 --> 31:53.927
- [Chad] Waste of a goddamn
pill is what it was.

31:53.927 --> 31:55.090
- [Tanner] Well, it coulda been worse.

31:55.090 --> 31:56.250
She coulda turned us in.

31:56.250 --> 31:58.537
- Fuck that, "Coulda been worse."

32:00.610 --> 32:03.143
No, I wanna make somebody
pay for this shit.

32:04.000 --> 32:06.330
- [Chad] I don't think
that's a good idea, man.

32:06.330 --> 32:08.983
- What, you scared of
some cunts on two wheels?

32:10.050 --> 32:11.320
- [Chad] I'm not scared of shit.

32:11.320 --> 32:13.520
- Good, 'cause those bitches don't know

32:13.520 --> 32:14.637
what's coming to 'em.

32:15.640 --> 32:16.473
Let's go.

32:29.247 --> 32:32.830
(dial tone softly ringing)

32:37.574 --> 32:40.170
- [Voicemail] Your call
has been forwarded--

32:41.916 --> 32:45.249
(birds softly chirping)

32:49.480 --> 32:50.313
- You nervous?

32:52.830 --> 32:53.663
- Yeah.

32:56.690 --> 32:58.830
I didn't think those
assholes were ever gonna get

32:58.830 --> 33:00.030
what was coming to them.

33:01.780 --> 33:02.780
- Sure we'd get 'em.

33:06.360 --> 33:07.510
- Is this what you did?

33:09.298 --> 33:10.548
When, you know.

33:17.359 --> 33:18.192
- No.

33:19.260 --> 33:21.370
By the time I met these girls, he was...

33:25.010 --> 33:25.860
He was long gone.

33:38.191 --> 33:39.500
You know, you don't have to do anything

33:39.500 --> 33:41.981
you don't wanna do, right?

33:41.981 --> 33:45.064
(light tribal drums)

34:01.340 --> 34:02.890
- You ready to join our family?

34:05.217 --> 34:06.133
- Yes.

34:10.790 --> 34:12.283
- The same leather vest.

34:13.190 --> 34:14.290
This will be your cut.

34:15.199 --> 34:16.953
It's a symbol of what we are.

34:17.800 --> 34:19.223
What we mean to each other.

34:20.210 --> 34:24.000
Anyone wearing this cut
is one of your sisters.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.263
And you're one of theirs.

34:26.130 --> 34:27.322
You understand?

34:28.219 --> 34:29.053
- [Mary] Yes.

34:30.500 --> 34:33.620
- This cut will become
part of who you are.

34:33.620 --> 34:35.322
Your identity from this point on.

34:36.262 --> 34:38.400
You can forget about your old family

34:38.400 --> 34:40.563
'cause we are your sisters now!

34:42.060 --> 34:43.803
You forget about your old school.

34:44.800 --> 34:46.382
We're your education now.

34:47.469 --> 34:48.543
Through thick and thin.

34:49.980 --> 34:50.943
You're one of us.

34:52.150 --> 34:54.199
So it's time to leave the old you behind.

35:09.301 --> 35:11.028
Who are we?

35:11.028 --> 35:12.937
- [Bikers] Dark Moon!

35:12.937 --> 35:14.084
- [Trigga] Who are we?

35:14.084 --> 35:16.175
- [Bikers] Dark Moon!

35:16.175 --> 35:19.508

35:31.097 --> 35:34.514

35:36.929 --> 35:38.596

(loudly shouting battle cry)

35:44.916 --> 35:48.083
(all loudly cheering)

35:49.183 --> 35:52.944

35:52.944 --> 35:56.111
(all loudly cheering)

36:12.364 --> 36:14.781

36:28.680 --> 36:32.340

38:18.295 --> 38:19.745
- Told you it'd beat the bar.

38:20.790 --> 38:23.973
- I don't know, man, I
mean, Monty's has alcohol.

38:27.470 --> 38:29.440
This place is lookin' up though.

38:29.440 --> 38:31.503
- I thought I'd be able
to change your mind.

38:34.016 --> 38:36.450
(softly coughing)

38:36.450 --> 38:37.587
Wow, gimme.

38:39.180 --> 38:41.540
Quite the tough guy, huh?
- Whoa, hey,

38:41.540 --> 38:43.680
I never claimed to be the tough guy.

38:43.680 --> 38:44.513
- That's true.

38:45.920 --> 38:47.533
- This place is amazing, though.

38:49.670 --> 38:52.193
- Yeah, this is where
I come to just kinda,

38:53.140 --> 38:54.970
like veg out, you know?

38:54.970 --> 38:55.803
- Yeah.

38:57.960 --> 39:00.294
Have you been coming here for a long time?

39:00.294 --> 39:03.490
- Since I was a kid.

39:03.490 --> 39:05.140
Real young, when my mom was sick.

39:06.340 --> 39:08.370
I mean, life changed after that and,

39:08.370 --> 39:09.870
I just always, I came up here.

39:10.849 --> 39:12.199
And then Trigga took me in.

39:13.160 --> 39:15.510
She didn't care who I
was or where I came from.

39:18.790 --> 39:20.790
- Sometimes it's all you need, you know?

39:22.060 --> 39:23.810
Someone that makes you feel special

39:24.918 --> 39:29.313
and just changes your whole
outlook on life, you know?

39:29.313 --> 39:31.730
(soft music)

39:33.200 --> 39:34.033
Look,

39:36.380 --> 39:39.161
Maggie, there's something
I need to tell you.

39:39.161 --> 39:41.703
- No, we can talk about that later.

39:42.920 --> 39:46.342
'Cause right now I'm gonna
get you really fucked up.

39:46.342 --> 39:47.175
- Really?

39:47.175 --> 39:50.617
- 'Cause I am talking
out of this world, just

39:51.665 --> 39:54.267
(both softly mimicking explosion) Okay?

39:54.267 --> 39:55.100
- Okay, okay, and how do you
plan on getting me there?

40:09.475 --> 40:10.308
Wow.

40:11.196 --> 40:12.029
- Yeah.

40:13.706 --> 40:17.033
And if you like that, you're
gonna love what comes next.

40:17.033 --> 40:19.831
- Oh, what's next?

40:19.831 --> 40:22.248
(soft music)

40:37.467 --> 40:38.300
- Brian.

40:41.584 --> 40:42.417
- What?

40:45.925 --> 40:48.170
Hey, I'll stop if you don't

40:48.170 --> 40:51.698
feel comfortable.
- No,

40:51.698 --> 40:52.531
I want to.

40:54.160 --> 40:55.729
- [Brian] You sure?

40:55.729 --> 40:56.562
- Yeah.

40:58.209 --> 41:00.626
(soft music)

41:32.285 --> 41:35.973
- So, I've been doing a lot of thinking.

41:37.580 --> 41:40.870
I think this place might beat the bar.

41:40.870 --> 41:45.257
- (softly laughing) It
better fucking beat the bar.

41:53.240 --> 41:55.500
- Look, there's something
I need to tell you,

41:55.500 --> 41:57.193
that I was trying to tell you before.

41:59.050 --> 42:02.539
I kinda followed you guys to
the quarry the other night.

42:02.539 --> 42:03.770
- What do you mean you kinda followed us?

42:03.770 --> 42:05.930
How the hell do you
kind of follow someone?

42:05.930 --> 42:06.853
- I mean, I didn't mean to.

42:06.853 --> 42:09.550
I mean, I meant to, I just
didn't know that you guys were--

42:09.550 --> 42:11.210
- Were beating the shit
out of your friends?

42:11.210 --> 42:13.250
- They're not my friends.

42:13.250 --> 42:15.757
I know why you guys did what you did.

42:17.760 --> 42:18.660
- You knew what happened?
(ominous music)

42:18.660 --> 42:19.700
- No, no, no, I--

42:19.700 --> 42:20.533
- You actually knew?

42:20.533 --> 42:22.020
- No, I just, I just found out.

42:22.020 --> 42:23.600
I didn't know about it before.

42:23.600 --> 42:24.800
That's why I called you.

42:25.890 --> 42:26.763
I didn't know.

42:27.900 --> 42:30.600
Look, what I'm trying to say is

42:30.600 --> 42:34.883
I know why you guys did what
you did, you're right, okay?

42:35.720 --> 42:38.570
I saw Mary that night, and she was drunk.

42:38.570 --> 42:41.310
I tried to help her, I
asked if she needed help.

42:41.310 --> 42:43.480
I never thought that they were gonna...

42:45.649 --> 42:48.066
(soft music)

42:50.760 --> 42:52.910
You gave those assholes
what they deserved.

42:55.550 --> 42:56.743
Keegan wants payback.

42:59.265 --> 43:01.650
- Look, I don't want you
getting caught up in this.

43:03.394 --> 43:05.923
- I just don't want you to get hurt.

43:06.828 --> 43:09.495
(ominous music)

43:29.620 --> 43:32.090
- [Brian] So, I'll see you tomorrow?

43:32.090 --> 43:34.190
- [Maggie] I mean, if you're lucky, maybe.

43:39.150 --> 43:40.900
- [Brian] Can't wait.

43:44.605 --> 43:47.272
(ominous music)

43:54.290 --> 43:55.123
- Yo, Brian?

43:57.440 --> 44:00.038
We're going out to Monty's
tonight for a few drinks.

44:00.038 --> 44:01.773
You know, find a few bitches.

44:02.790 --> 44:03.623
You wanna come?

44:04.485 --> 44:05.800
- No, man, uh...

44:09.910 --> 44:12.260
Gotta stay in and study.

44:12.260 --> 44:14.853
- You got a little time to
come out and play, don't you?

44:18.930 --> 44:20.243
- Suit yourself, pussy.

44:29.660 --> 44:30.710
- I just wanna let you know

44:30.710 --> 44:33.960
that we do take these
allegations very, very seriously.

44:33.960 --> 44:37.853
But what you're saying is
hearsay, it's conjecture.

44:39.180 --> 44:41.163
You say you saw some pill bottles.

44:41.163 --> 44:42.823
How do you know it wasn't Advil?

44:43.870 --> 44:44.870
- It was not Advil.

44:44.870 --> 44:46.340
- [Administrator] That's
what you say though,

44:46.340 --> 44:47.730
that's your opinion.

44:47.730 --> 44:50.250
- [Coach] Sorry I'm late, what'd I miss?

44:50.250 --> 44:52.000
- Absolutely nothing, we're actually

44:52.000 --> 44:53.900
just wrapping up right now, so--

44:53.900 --> 44:54.950
- These guys did it, all right?

44:54.950 --> 44:56.653
They drugged a girl and they raped her.

44:56.653 --> 44:57.486
You're just gonna let
them get away with it?

44:57.486 --> 45:00.360
- You know what, I resent
that implication, son.

45:00.360 --> 45:02.470
You better watch yourself.

45:02.470 --> 45:03.303
Look,

45:04.210 --> 45:05.370
I believe

45:06.590 --> 45:10.130
that you think that you
actually saw something.

45:10.130 --> 45:11.390
You know, a bottle--

45:11.390 --> 45:12.250
- I don't believe it--

45:12.250 --> 45:14.150
- [Coach] Don't fuckin' interrupt him.

45:15.070 --> 45:16.870
- But here's the thing, Mr. Cattrel,

45:17.720 --> 45:20.703
no one has stepped forward,
there's been no victim.

45:21.860 --> 45:24.763
There's nothing here, okay?

45:25.980 --> 45:27.670
- If there's no case, then why is he here?

45:27.670 --> 45:30.573
- You have no case.

45:31.946 --> 45:34.613
(ominous music)

45:36.113 --> 45:37.976
- This is the clutch.
- Yes.

45:37.976 --> 45:40.630
- This is the throttle.
- Yes, right.

45:40.630 --> 45:41.500
- And this is the brake.

45:41.500 --> 45:42.622
- Yeah, but that's just the front brake

45:42.622 --> 45:43.570
'cause the back brake's down there,

45:43.570 --> 45:46.260
opposite side from the
gear change lever, right?

45:46.260 --> 45:47.530
- Fuck.

45:47.530 --> 45:48.363
- What?

45:48.363 --> 45:50.830
- How do you remember all this stuff?

45:50.830 --> 45:52.130
- You'll get it, trust me.

45:53.341 --> 45:55.708
(engine softly revving)

45:55.708 --> 45:59.060
(both softly giggling)

45:59.060 --> 46:01.610
- Man, I really love it here.

46:01.610 --> 46:02.443
- Yeah.

46:04.310 --> 46:05.822
So, where were we?

46:05.822 --> 46:08.130
- You were gonna let me ride it out.

46:08.130 --> 46:09.208
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

46:09.208 --> 46:10.148
- Was I?
- Mm-hm.

46:10.148 --> 46:13.896
- All right.
(Mary softly giggles)

46:13.896 --> 46:16.563
(ominous music)

46:27.530 --> 46:28.440
- [Trigga] Hey.

46:28.440 --> 46:29.273
- Hey.

46:32.871 --> 46:34.921
Looks like you guys were havin' some fun.

46:39.150 --> 46:39.983
- Yeah,

46:41.340 --> 46:42.173
I am.

46:44.042 --> 46:45.242
Your cousin's lovin' it.

46:46.360 --> 46:48.020
- I'm sure she is.

46:48.020 --> 46:50.890
- Wait till we get those
fuckers right, right?

46:50.890 --> 46:52.893
- We got 'em, Trig, we're good.

46:54.001 --> 46:56.090
- When'd you get a fucking conscience?

46:56.090 --> 46:58.213
There's no mercy for those
fuckers, you forget that?

47:08.850 --> 47:10.440
- I'm getting real fuckin' tired

47:10.440 --> 47:13.220
of havin' to keep meeting
you guys after practice.

47:13.220 --> 47:15.460
I got called to the
fucking president's office

47:15.460 --> 47:17.340
and your names came up.

47:17.340 --> 47:18.380
- What are you talking about, Coach?

47:18.380 --> 47:21.350
- You're too fuckin' dumb
to play stupid with me.

47:21.350 --> 47:23.630
You guys had some fun
with a drunk freshman

47:23.630 --> 47:25.310
and now somebody's pissed off.

47:25.310 --> 47:26.860
- Look, Coach, what you gotta understand

47:26.860 --> 47:27.693
about that bitch is--

47:27.693 --> 47:29.740
- Save it, I already took care of it.

47:29.740 --> 47:31.230
But that's not what I'd be worried about

47:31.230 --> 47:32.730
if I were you fuckers.

47:32.730 --> 47:34.140
You got somebody talkin'

47:34.140 --> 47:36.163
and I think you know exactly who it is.

47:41.470 --> 47:42.460
- We'll handle it.

47:42.460 --> 47:44.540
- [Coach] See that you do.

47:44.540 --> 47:47.460
- Coach, we're good on this though, right?

47:47.460 --> 47:48.293
With the girl?

47:48.293 --> 47:49.320
- Yeah, you're good.

47:49.320 --> 47:52.870
I just told 'em how you boys
were dedicated to football.

47:52.870 --> 47:55.090
- Thanks, Coach, we owe you.

47:55.090 --> 47:56.440
- Damn right you do, I'm not saying

47:56.440 --> 47:58.420
you little fuckwads can't have fun.

47:58.420 --> 48:01.023
But be a little bit more
fuckin' discrete next time.

48:05.382 --> 48:08.049
(ominous beats)

48:21.158 --> 48:23.400
(softly knocking)
- Guys?

48:23.400 --> 48:25.070
- [Keegan] Havin' some trouble?

48:25.070 --> 48:26.400
- Yeah, dude, my keys don't work.

48:26.400 --> 48:28.600
- Well, that's because this
house is for football players.

48:28.600 --> 48:30.180
Gotta be a football player to live here.

48:30.180 --> 48:31.900
See, we all thought you were on our team,

48:31.900 --> 48:34.881
but we all trust each other,
got each other's backs.

48:34.881 --> 48:37.512
You know, on and off the field.

48:37.512 --> 48:38.990
So we don't have any room on this team

48:38.990 --> 48:40.870
for anyone we don't trust.

48:40.870 --> 48:42.000
Ain't that right, boys?

48:42.000 --> 48:43.040
- [Both Boys] Sure is.

48:43.040 --> 48:45.070
- Look, dude, I have no
idea what's goin' on.

48:45.070 --> 48:47.920
- Why don't we help him
get his stuff packed up?

48:47.920 --> 48:49.991
We'll give him a nice, big farewell.

48:49.991 --> 48:51.531
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hm.

48:51.531 --> 48:56.531
(chilling music)
(Brian loudly grunts)

48:57.289 --> 48:59.081
(Brian loudly grunts)
See, fellas,

48:59.081 --> 49:01.603
Brian here's got his
own little biker bitch.

49:03.740 --> 49:06.543
Is that why you tried
to snitch on us, huh?

49:07.530 --> 49:09.440
You stickin' it to this cunt?

49:09.440 --> 49:11.228
Or is she givin' it to you?

49:11.228 --> 49:12.940
(Brian softly groans)

49:12.940 --> 49:14.690
- What'd you say, you fuckin' snitch?

49:14.690 --> 49:15.980
- Hey.
(Brian softly whispers)

49:15.980 --> 49:17.989
Now, we can't understand you.

49:17.989 --> 49:21.757
- Pussy. (loudly spits)

49:21.757 --> 49:26.757
(loudly smacking)
(ominous music)

49:28.850 --> 49:30.233
- Hey, look up.

49:33.740 --> 49:35.890
If you ever try to pull
that shit on us again,

49:35.890 --> 49:37.452
I will end you.

49:37.452 --> 49:40.779
And you can tell those cunts
we're coming for them too.

49:40.779 --> 49:43.446
(ominous music)

49:48.409 --> 49:51.909
(muffled hard rock music)

50:05.393 --> 50:08.039
- Dude, what the fuck?

50:08.039 --> 50:10.376
- Oh my god, Brian.

50:10.376 --> 50:11.900
You okay?

50:11.900 --> 50:13.527
Oh my god, gimme that.

50:15.870 --> 50:17.420
- Listen to me, listen to me,

50:17.420 --> 50:18.645
those guys do not give a fuck about

50:18.645 --> 50:20.379
what those idiots did to me--
- They did this to you?

50:20.379 --> 50:22.170
They fucking did this--
- Ahh, fuck, fuck, fuck,

50:22.170 --> 50:24.450
listen to me, listen to me, listen to me.

50:24.450 --> 50:26.480
Keegan is coming for you.

50:26.480 --> 50:27.460
I don't know what he's planning.

50:27.460 --> 50:30.450
He's planning something big, okay?

50:30.450 --> 50:32.340
- [Trigga] He can't be here.

50:32.340 --> 50:34.260
- He's hurt, okay, we
have to fucking help him.

50:34.260 --> 50:35.340
- He can't stay here.

50:35.340 --> 50:36.233
- Where is he supposed to go?

50:36.233 --> 50:37.930
- That is not our problem.

50:37.930 --> 50:40.060
- This happened to him
because he was trying to help!

50:40.060 --> 50:41.750
- And you are puttin' us all in danger

50:41.750 --> 50:42.590
by keeping him here.
- Danger?

50:42.590 --> 50:44.283
He can barely fucking breathe!

50:44.283 --> 50:46.510
- He was trying to help me.

50:46.510 --> 50:48.790
- We don't fuckin' know that.

50:48.790 --> 50:49.830
We don't know he's not fuckin' lyin'.

50:49.830 --> 50:52.230
- What the fuck is your problem?

50:52.230 --> 50:54.053
- You don't fucking remember
what they did to her?

50:54.053 --> 50:55.640
- They did to her, not him,

50:55.640 --> 50:57.480
he had nothing to do with this!

50:57.480 --> 50:59.470
- He's not so fuckin' different.

50:59.470 --> 51:00.563
None of 'em are.

51:01.490 --> 51:05.283
- Oh my god, you actually
believe that, don't you?

51:05.283 --> 51:08.360
It's us against the whole goddamn world?

51:08.360 --> 51:10.470
- Fuck has the world
ever done for us, huh?

51:10.470 --> 51:13.240
- I didn't sign on for
a war with the world.

51:13.240 --> 51:14.133
- You ride with your sisters!

51:14.133 --> 51:16.593
- And I will fucking die with them!

51:17.590 --> 51:18.720
But I am not getting dragged

51:18.720 --> 51:21.400
down your goddamn rabbit hole, Trig.

51:21.400 --> 51:24.380
I love you, Trig, and you know that.

51:24.380 --> 51:26.683
But this anger, this hate,

51:27.540 --> 51:28.570
you gotta get a handle on it,

51:28.570 --> 51:31.443
not just for us, but for you.

51:32.870 --> 51:33.929
- We don't fucking--
- Trig!

51:33.929 --> 51:35.329
Don't you fucking touch him.

51:36.830 --> 51:39.030
- Now we know where
your fucking loyalty is.

51:40.054 --> 51:43.363
Get the fuck outta
here, take him with you.

51:46.986 --> 51:47.819
- Trig.

51:51.549 --> 51:53.110
Fine, come on.

51:53.110 --> 51:55.777
(ominous music)

52:21.401 --> 52:23.734
- There she is, right there.

52:25.110 --> 52:27.651
We'll come back here tomorrow night,

52:27.651 --> 52:29.568
and we'll fuck them up.

52:36.924 --> 52:40.754
(soft music)
- Maggie.

52:40.754 --> 52:41.587
Maggie.

52:43.325 --> 52:44.158
- Fuck!

52:51.815 --> 52:55.640
It's just, I've never seen
her this mad before, ever.

52:55.640 --> 52:57.800
I mean, she's not fucking calm,

52:57.800 --> 53:00.230
but this is war to her, okay?

53:00.230 --> 53:01.573
This is fucking war.

53:02.810 --> 53:04.300
People are gonna get hurt.

53:04.300 --> 53:06.170
- I know, and this is not something

53:06.170 --> 53:07.910
we can control anymore, Maggie,

53:07.910 --> 53:09.600
let's just--
- What are you talking about?

53:09.600 --> 53:11.290
- The only way we stand a chance is

53:11.290 --> 53:12.240
if we leave town.
- I can't.

53:12.240 --> 53:15.016
- This is not your fight anymore.

53:15.016 --> 53:18.793
All this hate, it's just
gonna get everyone killed.

53:21.373 --> 53:22.206
- Brian,

53:25.082 --> 53:26.617
this is my family.

53:29.940 --> 53:32.360
- I just don't want you to get hurt.

53:34.320 --> 53:35.533
There's no winning here.

53:36.440 --> 53:39.350
Trigga's gonna take you
and the whole gang down.

53:40.500 --> 53:42.120
I'm not gonna let that happen.

53:42.120 --> 53:43.493
I care about you too much.

53:47.133 --> 53:49.323
Let's just leave,
please, let's just leave.

53:52.488 --> 53:54.554
- I don't know, man.

53:54.554 --> 53:57.304
(ominous music)

54:18.120 --> 54:19.313
- Make me feel lucky.

54:21.137 --> 54:22.063
Lucky to have you.

54:25.100 --> 54:26.300
- I'm worried about you.

54:28.720 --> 54:29.553
- Me, why?

54:31.540 --> 54:34.093
- I'm scared all of this has gone too far.

54:35.190 --> 54:36.380
- Us?

54:36.380 --> 54:37.213
- No.

54:38.850 --> 54:41.223
This fight, these guys.

54:42.140 --> 54:44.323
Why can't we just let it go?

54:44.323 --> 54:46.373
- 'Cause it's more complicated than that.

54:47.770 --> 54:50.200
- I know what you've all done for me

54:50.200 --> 54:51.553
and I'm so grateful.

54:54.386 --> 54:56.900
But is this where you wanna be?

54:56.900 --> 54:58.163
With all this violence?

54:59.350 --> 55:04.253
You love Maggie so much
and you both are so close.

55:05.420 --> 55:08.893
But you're letting this fight ruin that.

55:10.140 --> 55:11.890
And I can't let you do that for me.

55:12.920 --> 55:14.370
- Well, it's not all for you.

55:15.962 --> 55:17.810
It's for all of us.

55:17.810 --> 55:21.803
Forever we get told what
we can or we can't do.

55:23.040 --> 55:26.483
Forever we get raped and
we're told it's our fault.

55:28.450 --> 55:29.300
I'm done with it.

55:31.410 --> 55:34.393
We gotta stand up and
say enough is enough.

55:42.241 --> 55:44.908
(ominous music)

55:47.150 --> 55:51.010
- Fuck, dude, like, I don't
think this is a good idea.

55:51.010 --> 55:53.510
- You can come with us or not.

55:53.510 --> 55:57.140
But if you don't, once I clean
up those sluts, you're next.

55:57.140 --> 55:59.807
(ominous music)

56:29.378 --> 56:32.461
(muffled whimpering)

56:38.689 --> 56:41.371
- [Maggie's Voice] Please, no--

56:41.371 --> 56:42.204
Off me.

56:43.322 --> 56:46.655
(Maggie's voice softly whimpering)

56:46.655 --> 56:51.655
No! (softly whimpers)

56:56.882 --> 57:00.132
(drums softly beating)

57:04.484 --> 57:09.484
(heavy bass guitar)
(drums softly beating)

57:36.232 --> 57:38.613
(Trigga grunts)
(Keegan grunts)

57:38.613 --> 57:40.313
- Suck my dick, bitch.

57:40.313 --> 57:41.313
- [Nola] No!

57:43.621 --> 57:45.623
- Fuck, yeah!
- No!

57:45.623 --> 57:50.368
(men grunting)
(Mary grunting)

57:50.368 --> 57:54.285
(bat softly clatters on floor)

57:58.958 --> 57:59.791
No, no!

58:00.706 --> 58:04.676
(shotgun softly clatters on floor)

58:04.676 --> 58:07.926
(Keegan loudly grunts)

58:16.094 --> 58:18.677
(somber music)

58:28.510 --> 58:31.843
(Trigga softly sobbing)

58:33.580 --> 58:34.480
- [Tanner] Keegan!

58:35.461 --> 58:36.934
- Get up!

58:36.934 --> 58:38.073
- Chad!
- Come on!

58:38.073 --> 58:39.031
- Let's get outta here.

58:39.031 --> 58:40.553
- [Tanner] Let's get the fuck outta here.

58:40.553 --> 58:43.136
(somber music)

58:46.997 --> 58:50.664
(motorbike loudly rustling)

59:01.094 --> 59:03.261
- They fucking killed her.

59:06.091 --> 59:07.674
I'm gonna kill 'em.

59:12.217 --> 59:15.967
Are you fucking with me
or are you with them?

59:17.436 --> 59:20.831
- I will ride with you,
I will fight with you.

59:20.831 --> 59:23.498
And I will fucking die with you.

59:24.553 --> 59:25.636
I'm with you.

59:26.878 --> 59:29.461
(somber music)
