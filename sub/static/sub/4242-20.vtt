WEBVTT

00:00.358 --> 00:01.568
<i>So here's what's you missed
<i>Kurt pulled</i></i>

00:01.569 --> 00:03.779
<i>a last-minute switcheroo
for Carmen Tibideaux</i>

00:03.780 --> 00:05.665
<i>and nailed his NYADA audition,
while Rachel</i>

00:05.666 --> 00:07.216
<i>tried her old "Don't Rain
on My Parade" standby</i>

00:07.217 --> 00:08.117
<i>which we've all heard now,
like, a bajillion times,</i>

00:08.202 --> 00:09.669
<i>and she totally choked.</i>

00:09.736 --> 00:11.370
<i>Bieste admitted that
her husband Cooter hit her,</i>

00:11.371 --> 00:13.764
<i>but she lied and said she left
him, when actually, she stayed.</i>

00:13.840 --> 00:16.075
<i>Puck isn't graduating, which he
pretends not to care about...</i>

00:16.076 --> 00:17.434
I'm too stupid. <i>but a while
back, he told everybody</i>

00:17.511 --> 00:18.744
<i>that graduating high school
was something</i>

00:18.745 --> 00:20.246
<i>he was really
looking forward to.</i>

00:20.247 --> 00:22.265
<i>The Glee Club's been ignoring
Tina all year long.</i>

00:22.349 --> 00:23.916
Tina won't mind being recast.
No, she won't.

00:23.917 --> 00:25.817
<i>Actually, she kind of got
ignored last year, too.</i>

00:25.852 --> 00:27.053
<i>Actually, Tina's sort of been
ignored the whole time</i>

00:27.054 --> 00:28.304
<i>and she's been
in the New Directions!</i>

00:28.305 --> 00:30.389
<i>since, like forever.</i>

00:30.390 --> 00:31.924
<i>The first time she got a solo,
she insisted she was bad</i>

00:31.925 --> 00:33.425
<i>and forced Mr. Shue
to give the song to Rachel,</i>

00:33.426 --> 00:34.810
<i>and ever solo since, she's
either gotten booed</i>

00:34.811 --> 00:36.312
<i>or started crying
uncontrollably.</i>

00:36.313 --> 00:37.863
<i>No one noticed that she went
from dressing punk</i>

00:37.864 --> 00:39.315
<i>to dressing Goth to dressing
like a go-go dancer</i>

00:39.316 --> 00:40.582
<i>in '60s Swinging London.</i>

00:40.617 --> 00:41.541
<i>She even got Mike Chang
into college,</i>

00:41.568 --> 00:43.069
<i>and she hardly got a thank you.</i>

00:43.070 --> 00:44.287
<i>Sometimes people don't even
seem to know her name.</i>

00:44.288 --> 00:45.705
Girl Chang...
Tina Blowin' Wang...

00:45.706 --> 00:47.206
Asian Horror Movie!

00:47.207 --> 00:49.207
<i>And that's what
you missed on</i> Glee.

00:50.894 --> 00:54.546
Porcelain, Weezy,
you created a monster.

00:56.767 --> 01:00.268
They're calling Jessie
St. James a visionary,

01:00.320 --> 01:02.221
and lauding Vocal Adrenaline

01:02.222 --> 01:04.322
for their ongoing
commitment to diversity.

01:04.391 --> 01:06.659
But Jessie St. James was against
Unique performing

01:06.660 --> 01:08.077
as his true magical self.

01:08.078 --> 01:10.246
No, we were the ones who
convinced him to do that.

01:10.247 --> 01:11.446
Well, then, you only have
yourselves to blame.

01:11.448 --> 01:13.616
And the liberal media.

01:13.700 --> 01:14.866
Not really.
It was your idea.

01:14.901 --> 01:15.993
I have no memory of that.

01:16.036 --> 01:17.536
In any case, Unique is now

01:17.537 --> 01:19.922
a show choir celebrity.

01:20.006 --> 01:22.124
He/She will trounce us
at Nationals,

01:22.125 --> 01:24.418
and I will lose my Cheerios!
to Coach Roz Washington.

01:24.428 --> 01:26.178
I will not let that happen.

01:26.179 --> 01:28.914
We have but
one choice left to us:

01:28.915 --> 01:31.425
It's time to fight fire

01:31.468 --> 01:36.255
with the flaming flames
of additional flamey gay fire.

01:38.692 --> 01:40.976
Porcelain, you will
wear this flapper dress

01:40.977 --> 01:43.446
and perform at Nationals
as Porcelina.

01:43.530 --> 01:45.764
You already have the lady
gait and the lady voice,

01:45.816 --> 01:48.234
and you'll have to start
smoking, though,

01:48.235 --> 01:49.435
because this dress
is a size two.

01:49.486 --> 01:50.569
Okay, just because I'm gay
does not mean

01:50.570 --> 01:52.070
I like to dress up like a woman.

01:52.072 --> 01:53.038
Oh, come on.

01:53.039 --> 01:54.440
What about Halloween, Kurt?

01:55.709 --> 01:58.035
Trick or treat!
Ba-da bing!

01:58.044 --> 01:59.611
Ay, what's a guy gotta do

01:59.612 --> 02:02.248
to get a candy situation
up in here, huh?

02:02.299 --> 02:04.333
Okay, that was a
Halloween costume,

02:04.334 --> 02:07.002
and it is a far cry from starting out
on the stage at Nationals in a dress.

02:07.053 --> 02:08.794
Which is absolutely
out of the question.

02:08.839 --> 02:10.589
Well, then, the
New Directions! will lose.

02:10.590 --> 02:12.391
Hate to say it, kiddo,

02:12.459 --> 02:15.845
but if we want to beat Vocal
Adrenaline at Nationals,

02:15.846 --> 02:17.262
it's tuckin' time.

You've reaed the
office of Carmen Tibideaux,

05:12.939 --> 05:14.573
Dean of Vocal Performance,
at the New York Academy

05:14.574 --> 05:15.658
of Dramatic Arts.

05:15.659 --> 05:17.493
Please leave a message
after the tone.

05:18.995 --> 05:21.380
Hi, Madame Tibideaux, this is
Rachel Berry calling.

05:21.448 --> 05:24.450
I understand that
14 messages is a lot,

05:24.451 --> 05:25.868
but I just wanted to make sure

05:25.869 --> 05:27.503
that you got the muffin basket
that I sent

05:27.504 --> 05:30.506
as well as the invitation to
come and see my show choir

05:30.507 --> 05:32.207
perform at our Nationals
in Chicago.

05:32.208 --> 05:36.128
Every year, the judges give out
an award for an MVP,

05:36.129 --> 05:37.346
and I would really love it

05:37.347 --> 05:38.681
if you could be there
to watch me win.

05:38.682 --> 05:41.266
If anything, just to show you

05:41.267 --> 05:43.018
that what happened at
my audition was a fluke

05:43.019 --> 05:45.504
and that I do have the talent
and the ability

05:45.505 --> 05:47.172
to study with you
next year at NYADA.

05:47.173 --> 05:50.693
I... I understand that asking
you to make the trip is a lot,

05:50.694 --> 05:52.394
but I'm just...
I'm really not ready

05:52.395 --> 05:54.146
to give up on my dream, so...

05:54.147 --> 05:56.649
Thank you very much.

06:04.324 --> 06:05.991
Nationals.

06:08.378 --> 06:09.628
Okay, song selection:

06:09.696 --> 06:11.863
We'll be kicking off our
"Vintage" theme

06:11.864 --> 06:13.048
with the legendary
Jim Steinman's

06:13.133 --> 06:15.084
"Paradise by
the Dashboard Light."

06:15.168 --> 06:16.459
Rachel will do the solo,
"It's All Com..."

06:16.503 --> 06:18.203
"...Coming Back to Me Now."

06:18.204 --> 06:19.212
One of Celine Dion's most
powerful ballads,

06:19.222 --> 06:20.889
inspired by <i>Wuthering Heights.</i>

06:20.974 --> 06:22.558
And we'll be working in
a new Treble Tones number,

06:22.559 --> 06:24.876
utilizing the talents of our
featured performer,

06:24.877 --> 06:26.261
Porcelina Hummel.

06:26.346 --> 06:27.813
Not gonna happen,
Dragon Lady.

06:27.880 --> 06:29.055
Oh, you'll do
as you're told, he/she.

06:29.065 --> 06:30.599
We will be performing

06:30.600 --> 06:32.401
"What A Feeling,"
from <i>Flashdance,</i>

06:32.402 --> 06:34.570
and I'm familiar with the
choreography, of course,

06:34.571 --> 06:36.187
because I was Jennifer Beals'
dance double.

06:36.206 --> 06:37.355
And on that note,

06:37.390 --> 06:38.607
please look under your seats.

06:43.329 --> 06:44.580
Space helmets.

06:44.581 --> 06:46.915
Welding helmets
and leg warmers?!

06:47.000 --> 06:49.451
Best way to get props
is to use props.

06:49.502 --> 06:50.753
I am your father.

06:50.754 --> 06:52.120
Uh, Darth Vader.

06:52.122 --> 06:53.204
Is that a movie?

06:53.239 --> 06:54.790
A healthy dose of props,

06:54.874 --> 06:57.000
and our plucky transsexual
Porcelina,

06:57.043 --> 06:58.126
and you are over the top.

06:58.178 --> 07:00.412
Aren't props a little cheesy?

07:00.413 --> 07:03.132
Guys, I've asked for Sue's
help because she's a winner,

07:03.216 --> 07:05.634
and I'm not ashamed to admit
this... I want to win.

07:05.719 --> 07:07.686
But there's not one
person in that audience

07:07.687 --> 07:09.555
who will think we're
anything but underdogs

07:09.606 --> 07:11.106
who would be lucky to
place in Nationals.

07:11.191 --> 07:12.758
We didn't even make
the top ten last year.

07:12.759 --> 07:16.862
We've got one last week to come
together and shake things up.

07:16.929 --> 07:19.264
If there's anyone here
who is not up for trying

07:19.265 --> 07:20.699
and working their butts off,

07:20.700 --> 07:21.867
you should just get up
right now and leave.

07:23.620 --> 07:25.154
Whoa, whoa, Tina,
where you going?

07:25.238 --> 07:26.872
You guys don't need me...
carry on.

07:26.939 --> 07:28.448
Tina, you don't understand.
I need this.

07:28.458 --> 07:29.775
Because you blew an audition?

07:29.776 --> 07:31.326
That's not a reason for you

07:31.377 --> 07:32.611
to get a solo at Nationals.

07:32.662 --> 07:33.879
Maybe the rest of us
would like one, too.

07:33.946 --> 07:35.538
I wouldn't mind
another one

07:35.582 --> 07:36.799
before I get deported.

07:36.800 --> 07:38.500
I want one.
Even though I can't sing.

07:38.551 --> 07:39.751
Tina, Rachel is a senior.

07:39.786 --> 07:40.753
So are you, but you can bet

07:40.754 --> 07:41.720
the only thing you'll be doing

07:41.721 --> 07:42.879
is a dance break with Brittany.

07:42.922 --> 07:44.289
Other people matter.

07:44.340 --> 07:45.891
Tina, you may not always
get all the solos,

07:45.892 --> 07:46.966
but you are a key player.

07:47.010 --> 07:48.510
I put you in charge
of costumes.

07:48.561 --> 07:50.295
Wow! Like that's some prize.

07:50.363 --> 07:51.563
You want props
to move around?

07:51.631 --> 07:53.999
Well, I'm a human prop,
and I'm sick of it!

07:54.067 --> 07:55.725
Take a lap and cool down,
Asian Number One.

07:55.769 --> 07:57.770
My name is Tina.

07:57.771 --> 07:59.137
Tina Cohen Chang!

08:04.277 --> 08:05.577
Isn't she the one
who used to stutter?

08:05.578 --> 08:07.312
You're being selfish.

08:07.313 --> 08:08.313
How come when Rachel complains

08:08.314 --> 08:09.314
about not getting enough solos,

08:09.315 --> 08:10.365
she's "claiming her stardom,"

08:10.366 --> 08:11.324
but when I do it,
it's selfish.

08:11.334 --> 08:12.501
You're a junior.

08:12.502 --> 08:13.702
You'll get your
change next year.

08:13.703 --> 08:15.487
This is the seniors'
moment to shine.

08:15.538 --> 08:19.007
I'm really
disappointed in you.

08:19.008 --> 08:21.827
Tina, look, I understand
that you feel like

08:21.878 --> 08:23.595
your voice is being stifled
right now, in the Glee Club.

08:23.663 --> 08:24.963
I mean, I have no idea
why you would choose

08:24.964 --> 08:26.548
this moment specifically
to make a stink about it

08:26.633 --> 08:29.000
but I want you to know
that you are being heard.

08:29.001 --> 08:31.386
Which is why I'm willing
to offer you $50

08:31.471 --> 08:32.855
just to let this all go
until after Nationals.

08:34.440 --> 08:36.441
Do you have any idea how
important Nationals is to me?

08:36.442 --> 08:37.893
I mean, if I can convince
Carmen Tibideaux

08:37.894 --> 08:39.311
to come and
watch us perform,

08:39.312 --> 08:41.513
then it's basically like
a do-over for my NYADA audition,

08:41.514 --> 08:44.349
which means that my entire future
depends on us being amazing,

08:44.350 --> 08:46.034
which means that everyone
needs to do their part.

08:46.119 --> 08:47.861
Their part
to make you look good.

08:47.904 --> 08:51.990
I have sat, for three years,
in the back of that choir room,

08:52.041 --> 08:54.409
holding Mike's hand or
crying or smiling and swaying,

08:54.494 --> 08:57.296
while everyone else was
out there singing solos.

08:57.363 --> 08:59.832
Maybe I say something,
most of the time I don't,

08:59.833 --> 09:01.216
team player all the way.

09:01.217 --> 09:03.919
I am tired of being silent.

09:04.003 --> 09:05.838
I am one of the original
Glee Club members,

09:05.889 --> 09:07.840
and I was singing "Sit Down
You're Rockin' the Boat"

09:07.891 --> 09:09.308
when Finn and Puck were
still throwing Slushees at us.

09:09.309 --> 09:10.726
So when is it my turn?

09:10.810 --> 09:13.846
Do you have any idea how
difficult it is to be me?

09:13.847 --> 09:16.515
Do you have a Facebook
account or Twitter account?

09:16.516 --> 09:17.932
Yes. Do you have
time to watch Bravo

09:17.934 --> 09:20.068
or read a book or buy laces

09:20.069 --> 09:21.144
for your incredibly
high comical boots.

09:21.187 --> 09:23.105
Okay? I don't.

09:23.106 --> 09:24.656
It's exhausting being me.

09:24.657 --> 09:26.057
I get up at 5:00
in the morning

09:26.058 --> 09:27.192
just to get all
of this prepared,

09:27.193 --> 09:28.443
in case a solo
is thrown my way.

09:28.528 --> 09:31.280
I have the entire Sondheim,
Hamlisch, Lloyd-Webber,

09:31.364 --> 09:32.664
Elton John songbooks
memorized,

09:32.732 --> 09:34.232
including every single
Katy Perry hit, as well.

09:34.233 --> 09:37.035
And I do all of this while
keeping my boyfriend interested

09:37.069 --> 09:38.170
and physically satisfied

09:38.171 --> 09:39.755
and being the captain
of 16 clubs

09:39.756 --> 09:41.573
and keeping a 3.86 GPA.

09:41.624 --> 09:43.708
I could do all of that.
And you will.

09:43.743 --> 09:45.093
Next year.

09:45.094 --> 09:47.579
You'll have your
chance next year.

09:47.630 --> 09:51.183
All I want is, for one moment,
to feel like you...

09:51.184 --> 09:53.886
be up on that stage and get one
of the standing ovations

09:53.887 --> 09:55.137
you're so used to getting.

10:03.529 --> 10:05.197
I mean, I'm behind you 100%.

10:05.264 --> 10:06.865
Being gay doesn't mean
you're a cross-dresser.

10:06.866 --> 10:08.317
I mean, that's just silly.

10:08.401 --> 10:10.769
Oh, you did not just text me
that, Michael Robert Chang.

10:10.820 --> 10:12.537
Is that Tina?

10:12.538 --> 10:13.872
Hey, Tina.
What are you doing here?

10:13.940 --> 10:16.124
Fulfilling my duties
as costume coordinator

10:16.125 --> 10:17.376
and text-fighting with Mike,
who says

10:17.377 --> 10:18.577
my outburst in
Glee Club was unreasonable.

10:18.578 --> 10:19.577
Well, we're getting a hot
pretzel later,

10:19.579 --> 10:21.129
if you want to join us.

10:21.214 --> 10:22.714
Can't.
Have to go find gown fabric

10:22.715 --> 10:24.115
that doesn't clash with
the high yellow undertones

10:24.116 --> 10:25.500
of Rachel Berry's complexion.

10:25.501 --> 10:26.668
Oh...

10:30.173 --> 10:32.758
I can do everything
Rachel Berry can.

10:35.962 --> 10:37.679
Oh, my God!
Tina! Tina!

10:37.680 --> 10:39.297
Tina! Oh, my God! Oh, oh, oh!
Get her, get her, get her!

10:39.298 --> 10:40.298
Tina, are you okay?

10:40.299 --> 10:41.600
Can you hear me?
Look at me.

10:41.601 --> 10:43.643
Oh, my God, this is
like <i>Days of our Lives.</i>

10:43.653 --> 10:44.769
Can you hear me?

10:44.771 --> 10:46.021
Lost...
It's me...

10:46.105 --> 10:47.105
Kurt.
Rachel, it's me.

10:47.156 --> 10:48.690
Did you just
call me Rachel?

10:50.076 --> 10:51.660
Rachel, Kurt and I just saw you

10:51.661 --> 10:52.861
fall into the fountain.

10:52.862 --> 10:54.079
We think you may have
hit your head.

10:54.146 --> 10:55.530
We need to get you back
to the Glee Club, ASAP.

10:55.581 --> 10:57.666
Why?

10:57.667 --> 10:58.984
And we need to get
your solo ready,

10:58.985 --> 11:00.202
so you can win us
a national championship.

11:05.591 --> 11:08.794
Oh, my God...
I'm Rachel Berry.

11:10.886 --> 11:12.203
Rachel, I know you're
under a lot of pressure,

11:12.204 --> 11:13.304
but I need you
to come with me

11:13.305 --> 11:14.389
to Between the Sheets
after school.

11:14.390 --> 11:15.540
I'm in desperate need
of sheet music,

11:15.541 --> 11:16.808
and you're the only one
who can help me.

11:16.809 --> 11:18.009
If you want to run into your

11:18.010 --> 11:19.210
old pal Chandler,
far be it from me

11:19.211 --> 11:20.395
to stand in your way.

11:20.396 --> 11:21.513
We've been through this
a million times.

11:21.514 --> 11:22.647
It was just
a few text messages...

11:22.648 --> 11:23.815
Oh, hey there, Hobbit.

11:23.816 --> 11:24.899
Can't wait to
hear your solo

11:24.900 --> 11:26.401
in Glee Club today.

11:26.402 --> 11:28.603
Hope you don't choke like
you did in your NYADA audition.

11:28.604 --> 11:31.773
Rachel, I don't want to put
any more pressure on you,

11:31.774 --> 11:33.408
but winning at Nationals will
be the most important thing

11:33.409 --> 11:35.076
that will ever happen to me
in my entire life.

11:35.077 --> 11:36.494
I mean, you'll
basically be performing

11:36.495 --> 11:38.563
for every handi-capable kid
in the entire world.

11:38.564 --> 11:40.832
Mercedes?
Mmm, praise.

11:40.833 --> 11:42.667
Rachel, after your
solo, I have to bail

11:42.668 --> 11:44.118
Lord Tubbington
out of jail.

11:44.119 --> 11:46.737
He tried to sell my
iPhone for drugs.

11:46.738 --> 11:48.172
Brittany?

11:48.173 --> 11:51.075
Rachel, can I talk
to you for a second?

11:52.911 --> 11:54.412
I know that
drama school auditions

11:54.413 --> 11:55.713
are a year away for me,

11:55.714 --> 11:57.765
and I know that I'm
kind of a long shot,

11:57.766 --> 11:59.017
but I was
wondering if maybe

11:59.018 --> 12:00.251
you could give me
some pointers.

12:00.252 --> 12:01.436
That's enough, Tina.

12:01.437 --> 12:03.438
You can hawk
your chop suey recipes

12:03.439 --> 12:06.024
after Rachel shows us her solo
for Nationals.

12:06.025 --> 12:07.609
Sue, that's
incredibly racist.

12:07.610 --> 12:08.926
I can't be racist, William,

12:08.927 --> 12:11.079
as I am 1/16
Native American.

12:11.080 --> 12:13.982
My Comanche name
is Cheerleads With Wolves.

12:13.983 --> 12:15.867
Okay, guys,
Nationals is coming up,

12:15.868 --> 12:17.452
and it's all riding

12:17.453 --> 12:19.153
on the shoulders
of Rachel Berry.

12:19.154 --> 12:20.989
Rachel, why don't you come
up and show us what you got.

12:20.990 --> 12:23.241
Mr. Shue, can I have
a couple days to think about it?

12:23.242 --> 12:24.275
Could I get a second

12:24.276 --> 12:25.410
to talk to my fiancée?

12:25.411 --> 12:27.111
Sure.

12:27.112 --> 12:28.296
Rachel, this isn't you.

12:28.297 --> 12:29.881
The Rachel that I
fell in love with

12:29.882 --> 12:32.216
just nods to the band,
then starts wailing.

12:32.217 --> 12:34.285
Look, I know you got
a lot on your plate,

12:34.286 --> 12:36.254
with New York and planning
our wedding and whatnot,

12:36.255 --> 12:38.172
but you're at your best
when you're under pressure.

12:38.173 --> 12:40.291
Now, turn around
and show us

12:40.292 --> 12:41.843
how you're going to
win us Nationals.

12:41.844 --> 12:43.811
And afterwards, we're
going to make out

12:43.812 --> 12:46.898
because your boobs look slightly
bigger today for some reason.

16:13.472 --> 16:15.506
Hey, Tina, can I talk to you?

16:15.507 --> 16:16.808
I wanted to say
you're always

16:16.809 --> 16:18.342
so good in my musical numbers.

16:18.343 --> 16:20.352
Your oohs and aahs
are always on pitch,

16:20.412 --> 16:22.680
and your light sashaying makes
my tour de force performances

16:22.681 --> 16:24.398
even more spine-tingling,
if that's even possible.

16:24.399 --> 16:26.234
I appreciate it, and you.

16:26.235 --> 16:27.785
Rachel, I can't tell you
how long

16:27.786 --> 16:29.370
I've waited
to hear you say that.

16:29.371 --> 16:30.688
Just because you're

16:30.689 --> 16:32.156
a little more
in the background this year,

16:32.157 --> 16:34.125
don't doubt
your talent, Tina.

16:34.126 --> 16:35.793
Next year is all you.

16:35.794 --> 16:38.195
It's finally your chance
to shine.

16:41.216 --> 16:42.800
I couldn't believe it
when I heard that your

16:42.801 --> 16:44.836
NYADA audition
didn't go well.

16:44.837 --> 16:46.804
You're...
you're always so amazing.

16:46.805 --> 16:48.873
I wish Madame Tibideaux
agreed with you.

16:48.874 --> 16:51.542
So change her mind. I've tried.
She won't even return my calls.

16:51.543 --> 16:53.144
That's not the Rachel Berry
I know.

16:53.145 --> 16:54.929
If I were you,
I'd drive

16:54.930 --> 16:57.265
to wherever she is and I'd stay

16:57.266 --> 17:00.268
until I convinced Ms. Tibideaux
to give me another shot.

17:00.269 --> 17:01.769
I can't believe
how supportive you are

17:01.770 --> 17:03.721
when half the time,
I can't even be bothered

17:03.722 --> 17:05.690
to thank you for your tremendous
supporting performances.

17:05.691 --> 17:07.391
It's not completely selfless.

17:07.392 --> 17:09.076
You're our secret weapon,
Rachel Berry,

17:09.077 --> 17:11.112
and by helping you,
I help us all.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.917
Oh, my God, Tina! Are you okay?
Get her! Get her! Get her!

17:16.919 --> 17:19.753
Tina. Oh, my God, are you okay?
Ooh! Ooh, ooh!

17:19.755 --> 17:21.172
Ugh.

17:21.173 --> 17:23.708
Did she have to take in the
bolt of fabric with her?

17:23.709 --> 17:26.377
That silk charmeuse is worth,
like, 25 bucks a yard.

17:32.568 --> 17:34.219
A-five, six, seven, eight.

17:34.220 --> 17:36.288
Mask, mask, helmet down.

17:36.289 --> 17:38.406
Pivot, pivot.

17:38.407 --> 17:40.242
Jump, mask, boys.

17:40.243 --> 17:43.060
A-one, two, three,
four, five, six.

17:43.079 --> 17:45.213
Burn! Burn!

17:45.214 --> 17:46.581
Burn! Come on!

17:46.582 --> 17:47.716
Let it burn!

17:47.717 --> 17:49.084
Set this joint on fire!

17:49.085 --> 17:52.304
Come on, burn the joint down!

17:52.305 --> 17:54.055
Okay, cut the music.
Stop! Stop.

17:54.056 --> 17:57.175
This is an unmitigated disaster.

17:57.176 --> 17:59.628
Jennifer Beals
is spinning in her grave.

17:59.629 --> 18:04.065
Gentlemen, I asked for a cascade
of sparks timed to the rhythm.

18:04.066 --> 18:06.968
- I can't see through this helmet.
- I took mine off.

18:06.969 --> 18:09.037
Metal sparks in your face is how you get freckles.
Is this even legal?

18:09.038 --> 18:10.355
Yeah,
shouldn't we be in

18:10.356 --> 18:11.639
some sort of grinding union?
Wanky.

18:11.640 --> 18:12.774
Sue, they're right.

18:12.775 --> 18:14.576
They can't pick up
advanced choreography

18:14.577 --> 18:16.661
when they're weighed down
by helmets and metal grinders.

18:16.662 --> 18:18.947
Grind, grind, pivot, kick,
pivot, spin, flip, split.

18:18.948 --> 18:20.499
What's complicated
about that?

18:20.500 --> 18:22.200
These props were supposed
to add to the routine,

18:22.201 --> 18:23.502
not be the routine.

18:23.503 --> 18:25.337
Well, maybe
you're right, William.

18:25.338 --> 18:27.506
Maybe basic
sheet metal work

18:27.507 --> 18:30.509
is just too much for
your 12th place choir.

18:30.510 --> 18:32.827
Porcelain, thoughts?

18:32.828 --> 18:35.046
I'm not doing a drag number.

18:35.047 --> 18:36.598
We need a new approach.

18:36.599 --> 18:38.266
I have an idea.

18:39.936 --> 18:41.853
This is the
teachers' lounge.

18:41.854 --> 18:43.555
It is our sacred space.

18:43.556 --> 18:45.190
Britt and I are gay
and Mercedes is black,

18:45.191 --> 18:47.058
so kicking us out
would be a hate crime.

18:47.059 --> 18:48.343
Well, I'm not totally
gay, but I think

18:48.344 --> 18:49.811
that trees are born the
same way as babies,

18:49.812 --> 18:50.979
so kicking me out

18:50.980 --> 18:52.113
would be
kind of mean.

18:52.114 --> 18:53.448
Yeah. Thanks.

18:54.617 --> 18:56.034
I'm eating my chicken, ladies.

18:56.035 --> 18:57.685
You're still wearing
your wedding ring.

18:57.686 --> 18:58.954
And I saw you

18:58.955 --> 19:00.789
last night
at the 7:00 p.m. showing

19:00.790 --> 19:02.857
of <i>21 Jump Street...</i>
with Cooter.

19:02.858 --> 19:04.626
Cooter was in <i>21 Jump Street?</i>

19:04.627 --> 19:06.294
I didn't know
he was an actor.

19:06.295 --> 19:07.462
You told us
you were leaving him.

19:07.463 --> 19:08.630
You lied to us.

19:08.631 --> 19:10.248
I know how this looks,

19:10.249 --> 19:12.417
but you just don't understand
how complicated

19:12.418 --> 19:14.169
adult relationships can be.

19:14.170 --> 19:15.720
I mean, he hit you
and you stayed.

19:15.721 --> 19:17.806
What's complicated
about that?

19:17.807 --> 19:20.425
I'm very sorry if this
is confusing for you,

19:20.426 --> 19:22.093
but what's the world worth

19:22.094 --> 19:23.979
if people don't get
a second chance?

19:23.980 --> 19:25.981
Wait, so you're saying
he changed?

19:25.982 --> 19:29.734
Well, he knows now that if he
treats me bad again, I am out.

19:29.735 --> 19:31.987
You're so selfish!

19:31.988 --> 19:34.356
You're selfish for
making me feel this way,

19:34.357 --> 19:36.157
and I hate feeling
like this.

19:36.158 --> 19:37.892
You know you
push my buttons!

19:44.200 --> 19:45.367
I don't know.

19:45.368 --> 19:46.734
Can people change that fast?

19:46.735 --> 19:48.286
I mean, most guys I know
don't even know how

19:48.287 --> 19:50.071
- to change their own underwear.
- I couldn't really

19:50.072 --> 19:51.957
figure that out, so I just
stopped wearing any at all.

19:51.958 --> 19:53.574
I think you need
to get out of the house,

19:53.575 --> 19:54.759
if only for a weekend.

19:54.760 --> 19:56.077
Come with us
to Nationals.

19:56.078 --> 19:57.712
You have two
chaperones already.

19:57.713 --> 19:59.464
I don't even know
if I'm welcome

19:59.465 --> 20:01.182
back in Chicago
after I body-slammed

20:01.183 --> 20:02.767
Refrigerator Perry
in a bar fight.

20:02.768 --> 20:04.302
We care about you, Coach.

20:04.303 --> 20:05.971
We just want to see you safe.

20:05.972 --> 20:10.758
Thank you, girls,
but I can take care of myself.

20:13.529 --> 20:15.480
Please ignore the
stench of mildew

20:15.481 --> 20:16.865
and jock strap

20:16.866 --> 20:19.067
and focus your attention
on the screen.

20:19.068 --> 20:19.901
Porcelina?

20:21.570 --> 20:23.989
Yesterday, I snuck into
a Vocal Adrenaline rehearsal,

20:23.990 --> 20:26.274
and what I saw
is not for the faint of heart.

20:26.275 --> 20:27.409
Lights.

20:33.332 --> 20:34.833
Why is this
in black and white?

20:34.834 --> 20:36.084
Because I worship <i>The Artist.</i>

20:36.085 --> 20:37.502
Look at that.

20:37.503 --> 20:39.804
Unlike you misfit,
ragtag stumblebums,

20:39.805 --> 20:43.224
each member of Vocal Adrenaline
is in perfect sync.

20:43.225 --> 20:45.493
Not a step out of place.

20:45.494 --> 20:47.562
Okay, watch this closely, guys.

20:47.563 --> 20:48.980
It's called the Human Centipede.

20:48.981 --> 20:50.732
It's the newest, hardest

20:50.733 --> 20:52.300
show choir dance move
ever invented.

20:52.301 --> 20:53.868
Incredible.

20:53.869 --> 20:55.803
That actually really
doesn't look that hard.

20:55.804 --> 20:57.305
And the cherry on top

20:57.306 --> 21:00.475
of the Vocal Adrenaline sundae
is their secret weapon, Unique.

21:00.476 --> 21:02.577
Look at him/her.

21:02.578 --> 21:04.746
Poised, confident.

21:04.747 --> 21:07.415
Pretty as a picture
with a booty that won't quit.

21:07.416 --> 21:08.867
It's the Unique factor

21:08.868 --> 21:10.785
that gives Vocal Adrenaline
its edge.

21:13.205 --> 21:15.256
Isn't Rachel our
Unique factor?

21:15.257 --> 21:16.657
Not even close.

21:16.658 --> 21:17.792
I'm not saying
that Mrs. Focker

21:17.793 --> 21:19.094
doesn't deserve a solo,

21:19.095 --> 21:20.712
but every show choir
in the country

21:20.713 --> 21:22.964
- has a little girl with a big nose.
- Okay, Sue.

21:22.965 --> 21:26.167
High school judges
are proven idiots.

21:26.168 --> 21:30.138
They love props, and Unique
is the ultimate prop.

21:30.139 --> 21:31.306
Do you seriously think
that we need

21:31.307 --> 21:32.891
a guy to dress in drag to win?

21:32.892 --> 21:34.743
- No.
- Yes.

21:34.744 --> 21:37.645
It's the only way.

21:44.537 --> 21:46.521
Sounded pretty good to me.

21:46.522 --> 21:48.540
I'm singing into the notes,
not through them,

21:48.541 --> 21:50.542
but I'll get it.

21:50.543 --> 21:52.627
It never stops
for you, does it?

21:52.628 --> 21:54.195
Well, I let myself
get overconfident once,

21:54.196 --> 21:56.064
and I'm not
going to let it happen again.

21:57.366 --> 21:59.634
Have you heard back
from Carmen Tibideaux yet?

21:59.635 --> 22:02.587
I just have to accept the
fact that I'm not going to.

22:02.588 --> 22:04.005
I've e-mailed her
and called her,

22:04.006 --> 22:06.141
and there's nothing left
that I can do.

22:06.142 --> 22:09.677
You could go see her.
It's what you suggested I do in

22:09.678 --> 22:11.279
the body-swapping
dream I had about us.

22:11.280 --> 22:14.065
When I fell in the fountain at
the mall and hit my head.

22:14.066 --> 22:16.267
It was like <i>Freaky Friday.</i>
I was you, and you were me,

22:16.268 --> 22:19.053
and Kurt was Finn, and he wanted
to have sex with me, as you.

22:19.054 --> 22:20.405
That's very disturbing.

22:20.406 --> 22:22.323
But then you, as Tina,
told me, as Rachel,

22:22.324 --> 22:23.858
"Go see Carmen Tibideaux in
person

22:23.859 --> 22:25.393
and not take no for an answer."

22:25.394 --> 22:26.778
Okay, I'm very confused.

22:26.779 --> 22:29.697
But the advice I gave myself in
your dream was good.

22:29.698 --> 22:32.450
I did some research.

22:32.451 --> 22:35.170
Carmen Tibideaux is teaching
a master class at Oberlin.

22:35.171 --> 22:38.072
If we go right now,
we can still catch her.

22:38.073 --> 22:39.374
I could drive.

22:39.375 --> 22:40.742
You would do that for me?

22:42.678 --> 22:44.629
Why? I mean, all that stuff
you said.

22:44.630 --> 22:45.913
I mean, you weren't wrong.

22:45.914 --> 22:48.683
Look, everyone is important,

22:48.684 --> 22:51.519
and I'm very sorry if I made you
feel like a supernumerary.

22:51.520 --> 22:52.637
I'm sorry.

22:52.638 --> 22:55.023
Everyone has their part
to play, right?

22:55.024 --> 22:57.058
Maybe this is mine.

22:59.111 --> 23:00.145
Thank you.

23:02.815 --> 23:04.232
You do know that next year,

23:04.233 --> 23:05.567
you're going to be
the lead female vocalist.

23:05.568 --> 23:09.487
And it's a lot of pressure,
but I'm not worried.

23:11.240 --> 23:12.657
Oh, no, please don't cry.

23:12.658 --> 23:14.409
You need to drive
Is your Hyundai gassed-up?

23:14.410 --> 23:16.211
Since Porcelain refuses
to be a team player

23:16.212 --> 23:17.662
and dress up like a lady,

23:17.663 --> 23:20.131
we're gonna have
to up our prop game.

23:20.132 --> 23:22.783
I've ordered 18 little people,
one for each of you.

23:22.784 --> 23:24.302
Wait. Little people?

23:24.303 --> 23:25.753
Munchkins.
I found 'em online, William.

23:25.754 --> 23:27.505
And don't worry,
I got a mix of race

23:27.506 --> 23:29.957
and ethnicities so you can keep up
with your little diversity charade.

23:29.958 --> 23:32.310
I can't dance with a little
person. I can hardly walk.

23:32.311 --> 23:33.961
There's that can don't attitude,
Quinn.

23:33.962 --> 23:37.065
Sue, I think maybe we are going
a little too far with the props.

23:37.066 --> 23:39.567
Let's just spend some time working
on choreography for "Dash Board."

23:39.568 --> 23:41.802
Sure, if you want to lose.

23:41.803 --> 23:43.354
Puck?

23:44.773 --> 23:45.573
Hello...

23:45.574 --> 23:46.441
My eyes are burning.

23:46.442 --> 23:47.609
Look at those legs.

23:47.610 --> 23:49.861
I am strangely
turned on right now.

23:49.862 --> 23:52.197
Please only address me
by my stage name... Lola.

23:52.198 --> 23:54.082
Puckerman, I respect your
commitment to winning,

23:54.083 --> 23:56.751
but without a doubt, you are the
ugliest woman I have ever seen.

23:56.752 --> 23:58.620
For a second there, I thought
you were Beiste's sister.

23:58.621 --> 23:59.787
It's not about being pretty.

23:59.788 --> 24:01.089
It's about someone in here
having the balls

24:01.090 --> 24:03.091
to do what he has to do
to put us over the top.

24:03.092 --> 24:04.759
Well, you know, if this is gonna
work, you're gonna have

24:04.760 --> 24:05.760
to shave off all of
your body hair.

24:05.761 --> 24:06.794
Enough!

24:06.795 --> 24:07.962
Sue, look, I really appreciate

24:07.963 --> 24:09.514
all the help
you've been giving us

24:09.515 --> 24:10.965
but I am done with all
this props madness.

24:10.966 --> 24:12.600
All we're doing for the
next three hours

24:12.601 --> 24:14.352
is learning choreography
for "Dash Board."

24:14.353 --> 24:16.187
Puck, go change.

24:16.188 --> 24:17.889
You cannot see
something like that.

24:17.890 --> 24:20.942
William, I'm oddly aroused by
your sudden forcefulness,

24:20.943 --> 24:23.194
and I will let you
handle this rehearsal,

24:23.195 --> 24:25.196
however, I feel it
necessary to warn you:

24:25.197 --> 24:27.615
I prepaid for
the little people.

24:29.902 --> 24:32.820
It's the darkest day in Ohio
since Ernest Byner. Boy, how the

24:32.821 --> 24:34.038
mighty have
truly fallen, huh?

24:34.039 --> 24:35.907
Take a good look
at him, boys.

24:35.908 --> 24:39.294
This empty, useless shell of a
man you see before you used

24:39.295 --> 24:41.028
to be the Noah Puckerman,

24:41.029 --> 24:42.863
the guy they named the Dumpster
out by the smoking lounge

24:42.864 --> 24:44.966
after 'cause he had dumped
more dweebs in it

24:44.967 --> 24:45.866
than any ten dudes
combined.

24:45.867 --> 24:47.252
Keep rocking that mullet, Ricky,

24:47.253 --> 24:49.554
Maybe it a few years it will
come back in style.

24:49.555 --> 24:52.473
And today he finally succumbed
to the toxic fumes of Glee Club

24:52.474 --> 24:55.226
and came to school wearing a fricking dress.
Are you looking

24:55.227 --> 24:57.812
to pick a fight? 'Cause there's
three of you and one of me,

24:57.813 --> 24:59.931
so you're gonna you'd need
about two more guys

24:59.932 --> 25:01.683
to make it a fair fight,
you fricking loser.

25:01.684 --> 25:02.901
Oh, I'm a loser?

25:02.902 --> 25:04.569
Did I tell you I got
into Ohio State?

25:04.570 --> 25:05.987
Yeah, I'm gonna
play hockey there.

25:05.988 --> 25:08.055
What's your plan
after graduation?

25:08.056 --> 25:11.225
Oh, that's right,
you aren't graduating.

25:11.226 --> 25:13.027
Face it, Puck,
you're the guy

25:13.028 --> 25:15.613
we all used to make fun
of when we were freshman.

25:15.614 --> 25:17.165
The one who used to hang out
hung out in front of the 7-11

25:17.166 --> 25:18.583
picking up on high school girls
after graduating.

25:18.584 --> 25:20.285
In two months you'll
be buying

25:20.286 --> 25:22.287
my little brother beer
and just begging him

25:22.288 --> 25:24.923
to take you to a party.
You're a Lima loser.

25:24.924 --> 25:27.008
I'm going to rip that mullet off
your head.

25:27.009 --> 25:29.460
You want to fight, fine.
But not here.

25:29.461 --> 25:30.678
Out by your Dumpster.

25:30.679 --> 25:32.797
See, I don't want
to get in trouble.

25:32.798 --> 25:34.766
'Cause unlike you,
I got a lot to lose.

25:42.792 --> 25:44.492
How's the wedding
planning going?

25:44.493 --> 25:47.429
Kind of slow lately, but we
still have the same plan:

25:47.430 --> 25:49.631
win Nationals, come back,
graduate, and then

25:49.632 --> 25:51.833
just have a nice little church
wedding performed

25:51.834 --> 25:53.835
by a rabbi with our
nearest and dearest.

25:53.836 --> 25:56.722
And hopefully nobody will get
tragically injured this time.

25:56.723 --> 25:59.174
You think we're gonna win
Nationals?

25:59.175 --> 26:01.810
You know, our first Regionals
and last year,

26:01.811 --> 26:03.979
I had this feeling, like
we were just gonna win.

26:03.980 --> 26:05.513
But this year, nothing.

26:05.514 --> 26:07.866
I just really, really,
want to win, though.

26:07.867 --> 26:09.818
If not for us,
then for Mr. Schue.

26:11.204 --> 26:15.073
What if we go all this way,
and Carmen just says no?

26:15.074 --> 26:16.358
She won't.
She might.

26:16.359 --> 26:18.293
I don't have a back up plan,
all right?

26:18.294 --> 26:20.045
And I don't want to waste
lose a year

26:20.046 --> 26:21.213
of my ingenue eligibility.

26:21.214 --> 26:22.497
You always make it
so hard,

26:22.498 --> 26:24.333
but you were born under
a blessed gold star.

26:24.334 --> 26:25.634
Everyone knows it.

26:25.635 --> 26:27.803
I don't know if I think
that way anymore.

26:27.804 --> 26:30.305
I mean, think of most
of the adults we know, okay?

26:30.306 --> 26:33.058
I bet you that things used to
go their way all the time,

26:33.059 --> 26:34.559
and then one day,
just, they didn't.

26:34.560 --> 26:36.211
And now they
have a job they hate

26:36.212 --> 26:38.313
and they live a life that
they don't even recognize.

26:38.314 --> 26:40.933
And I bet you that they don't
even bother to dream anymore.

26:40.934 --> 26:41.934
That's not everyone.

26:41.935 --> 26:43.185
Yeah, but most people.

26:46.906 --> 26:50.325
No. Okay. I'm not going
there yet.

26:50.326 --> 26:52.560
Carmen is going to say yes.

26:52.561 --> 26:54.613
There's the Rachel Berry
we all know and love.

26:56.449 --> 26:58.233
Yeah, I'm really glad
we're doing this together.

26:58.234 --> 27:00.168
Thank you.

27:00.169 --> 27:01.703
Can you do me one favor?

27:01.704 --> 27:04.589
Before you graduate,
can we sing together?

27:04.590 --> 27:07.843
I would love that.

27:17.253 --> 27:19.521

a change of clothes

27:19.522 --> 27:20.722

27:20.723 --> 27:22.424
But hey, maybe while
you're in there,

27:22.425 --> 27:23.892
you'll find your garbage father.

27:23.893 --> 27:26.094
How's he doing,
by the way?

27:26.095 --> 27:28.196
You know, I tried his microbrew.
It sucked.

27:29.399 --> 27:31.817
Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!

27:31.818 --> 27:33.035
Game on.

27:37.740 --> 27:38.606

Take him down!

Hit him!

27:52.805 --> 27:55.307
Hit him! Hit him!

28:02.899 --> 28:05.350
Let's just make this easy.
Hop in there yourself.

28:05.351 --> 28:06.468

28:17.780 --> 28:21.116

28:30.927 --> 28:32.594
Ah, you want some more,
there, Nancy?

28:35.548 --> 28:37.349
Whoa! Whoa, dude.
What the hell you doing, man?

28:37.350 --> 28:38.717
I'm not a loser!

28:38.718 --> 28:40.969
Drop it!
Get over here!

28:40.970 --> 28:41.836
Drop it!

28:44.390 --> 28:47.192
The show's over!
Everybody go home!

28:47.193 --> 28:49.844
Get out of here!

28:51.364 --> 28:52.647
Except for you.

28:52.648 --> 28:54.282
Come on!

28:56.486 --> 28:58.370
A knife?!

28:58.371 --> 29:00.572
It's rubber. It's just a prop
from <i>West Side Story.</i>

29:00.573 --> 29:01.873
What the hell are you thinking?!

29:01.874 --> 29:03.325
You could get expelled for this!

29:03.326 --> 29:04.626
It doesn't matter.
I'm flunking out!

29:04.627 --> 29:05.860
You've got a record!

29:05.861 --> 29:07.329
You could get
arrested for assault!

29:07.330 --> 29:08.530
I don't care!

29:08.531 --> 29:10.048
Well, you damn well should care!

29:10.049 --> 29:11.416
I'm nothing!

29:13.052 --> 29:15.087
Don't you get it?!
I'm nothing!

29:15.088 --> 29:17.806
I'm the school joke!
A failure!

29:19.592 --> 29:21.643
You don't know what it's like
to be worthless,

29:21.644 --> 29:23.178
where nothing you do matters!

29:23.179 --> 29:25.931
I feel that way every day
of my life!

29:25.932 --> 29:27.715
Every damn day!

29:27.716 --> 29:30.352
You know how many
football games or concerts

29:30.353 --> 29:33.522
my mom's been to in the last four years?
None. Not one.

29:33.523 --> 29:36.274
My dad's been AWOL since
I was ten years old,

29:36.275 --> 29:39.611
which is fine because all he ever
did was tell me I was garbage!

29:39.612 --> 29:41.446
And he must be really
proud of himself

29:41.447 --> 29:42.897
'cause that's exactly
how I turned out!

29:47.403 --> 29:49.037
I'm sorry.

29:49.038 --> 29:51.289
I'm sorry.

29:51.290 --> 29:53.241
Come here.

29:53.242 --> 29:56.595
I'm sorry!

29:56.596 --> 30:00.465
You know, you and me,
we're badasses.

30:00.466 --> 30:04.970
Nobody thinks
anything hurts us, but it does.

30:04.971 --> 30:07.088
It does. It's okay.

Thank you, Madame Tibideaux.

Thank you.

Madame Tibideaux, hello.
I'm sorry to interrupt,

30:55.910 --> 30:57.127
but it's me, Rachel Berry.

30:58.129 --> 30:59.763
I'm sorry.
I realize that I've

30:59.764 --> 31:01.381
been a little persistent,
but I'm just...

31:01.382 --> 31:05.614
I am a very busy woman.

31:06.721 --> 31:08.421
Every moment I spend deleting

31:08.422 --> 31:10.307
yet another one of your
voicemails

31:10.308 --> 31:12.309
about lost hopes and dreams

31:12.310 --> 31:14.311
takes time away
from another student.

31:14.312 --> 31:17.030
What makes you think you
are entitled

31:17.031 --> 31:20.433
to any more attention than
other hundreds of people I see

31:20.434 --> 31:21.935
with the same hopes
and dreams?

31:21.936 --> 31:24.437
No. I'm so sorry. I don't mean
to take time away from them.

31:24.438 --> 31:26.240
But you do.

31:26.241 --> 31:27.774
And I'm tired of it.

31:27.775 --> 31:29.827
Ms. Tibideaux, I know
exactly how you feel.

31:29.828 --> 31:31.712
Rachel Berry is
a pain in the ass.

31:31.713 --> 31:34.047
What she wants, she gets.

31:34.048 --> 31:36.783
And I've spent a lot of time
resenting her for it.

31:36.784 --> 31:39.953
But the fact is, she gets
it because she's exceptional.

31:39.954 --> 31:41.839
Not just the voice,
which is sick,

31:41.840 --> 31:44.091
but the focus, the drive.

31:44.092 --> 31:46.310
How often do you come across
the real deal?

31:46.311 --> 31:48.846
The "real deal" that couldn't
remember the words to the song?

31:48.847 --> 31:51.298
Which was as rare as a Bigfoot sighting.
She had an off day,

31:51.299 --> 31:52.599
and that decides
her entire future?

31:52.600 --> 31:54.768
Ms. Tibideaux, I realize
that I'm asking you

31:54.769 --> 31:56.803
to take me into special
consideration.

31:56.804 --> 31:59.323
but let me ask you.
You've had an amazing career,

31:59.324 --> 32:01.158
did you get there
by playing by it safe?

32:03.995 --> 32:06.613
Please, we're performing
our Nationals in Chicago,

32:06.614 --> 32:08.615
and we saw that you're gonna
be singing there

32:08.616 --> 32:10.000
at the Lyric Opera.

32:10.001 --> 32:12.152
And before you close the door,
I just,

32:12.153 --> 32:14.922
I need you to hear me sing.
I have to.

32:14.923 --> 32:17.457
There's nothing that
I'm as good at

32:17.458 --> 32:21.011
or as passionate about or that
brings me that much joy.

32:21.012 --> 32:22.930
And I think that
that sets me apart.

32:26.134 --> 32:29.269
And I think it's time for you
and your friend to go.

32:31.522 --> 32:34.308
Okay, but I just want you
to know that...

32:34.309 --> 32:36.676
I'll see you again next year.

32:36.677 --> 32:38.695
And every year after
that until I get in.

32:38.696 --> 32:41.398
Didn't I read somewhere
that you

32:41.399 --> 32:42.983
auditioned for Juilliard
four times?

32:46.854 --> 32:48.455
Thank you.

33:00.385 --> 33:01.885
Hey, baby.

33:01.886 --> 33:03.387
I got us a couple of pies.

33:03.388 --> 33:05.305
Hawaiian, your favorite.

33:08.209 --> 33:10.894
I'm sorry, Shannon.

33:10.895 --> 33:12.963
You know how sorry I am.

33:12.964 --> 33:15.766
Listen, guy
from Michigan

33:15.767 --> 33:18.551
has been poaching every
kid I took a sniff of

33:18.552 --> 33:20.654
and everyone's on my ass

33:20.655 --> 33:23.824
and, if I'm being
totally honest...

33:25.994 --> 33:28.829
I'm always feeling like
I'm disappointing you.

33:30.531 --> 33:34.734
And... it doesn't matter.

33:34.735 --> 33:36.336
You know why?

33:36.337 --> 33:39.373
'Cause I know I can't
lose my cool anymore,

33:39.374 --> 33:41.091
and I won't.

33:41.092 --> 33:42.476
I promise.

33:44.929 --> 33:47.014
Oh, come on, baby, sit
down. We're celebrating.

33:47.015 --> 33:50.050
You remember that, uh, that
bear of a lineman I told you

33:50.051 --> 33:51.885
I was hot on from
Newton South?

33:51.886 --> 33:53.937
Got him to sign on
the dotted line!

33:57.191 --> 33:58.976
Come on, baby.

34:01.429 --> 34:02.763
You got my word.

34:12.040 --> 34:15.625
What, are you gonna stab me?

34:15.626 --> 34:16.775
Not with that one.

34:16.777 --> 34:18.128
It's fake.

34:18.129 --> 34:19.963
Maybe the big one
in the kitchen.

34:19.964 --> 34:23.783
The one I've been sleeping
with at night under my pillow.

34:23.784 --> 34:26.453
Oh, God.

34:26.454 --> 34:28.422
Baby, I'm so sorry.

34:30.391 --> 34:32.559
I mean, how did we let it
get so out of hand?

34:32.560 --> 34:33.527
I'm out.

34:35.596 --> 34:37.848
I got shame about what
happened between us,

34:37.849 --> 34:41.268
but I leave that here
with my ring and with you.

34:41.268 --> 34:43.853
Oh, please, please.

34:43.855 --> 34:47.190
Don't... don't leave me, okay?

34:47.190 --> 34:51.110
You can't hate me anymore
than I already hate myself.

34:51.112 --> 34:52.779
I don't hate you!

34:52.780 --> 34:54.447
That's the awful part of it.

34:54.449 --> 34:55.831
I love you!

34:55.833 --> 34:59.453
But what does that say
about what I think of me?

35:03.257 --> 35:06.343
What are you gonna do, huh,
just walk out on me?

35:06.344 --> 35:09.346
Who's going to love you
the way I loved you, Shannon?

35:09.347 --> 35:11.798
Who's going to love you now?

35:13.935 --> 35:15.802

37:42.950 --> 37:45.418
Just trying out a song
for Nationals.

37:45.419 --> 37:47.120
I gotta win at something.

37:47.121 --> 37:49.506
Well, you may not know it,
but you already have.

37:49.507 --> 37:51.424
I talked to
Mrs. Doosenberry.

37:51.425 --> 37:54.294
She's gonna let you have
another go at that test.

37:54.295 --> 37:56.179
Why? She hates me.

37:56.180 --> 37:57.830
Hated your attitude.

37:57.831 --> 37:59.666
But I told her
how you wiggled

37:59.667 --> 38:02.001
into a skirt for the
good of your team.

38:02.002 --> 38:03.503
She's into that?

38:03.504 --> 38:04.804
Oh, should've known
Doosenberry was a lady-lover

38:04.805 --> 38:06.673
when she didn't climb
aboard the Puck wagon.

38:06.674 --> 38:10.360
No, when you did that, you showed
that you cared about something.

38:10.361 --> 38:14.013
Something way bigger
than just you.

38:14.014 --> 38:15.982
That's all she ever
wanted from you.

38:15.983 --> 38:18.451
That's all any of us
teachers ever wanted.

38:18.452 --> 38:21.488
So, you're gonna
retake the exam

38:21.489 --> 38:23.990
next week, and I'm gonna
help you through it.

38:23.991 --> 38:26.693
Why would you do that,
help me like that?

38:26.694 --> 38:31.248
Because, Noah, you will never
know how much you've helped me.

38:32.633 --> 38:34.251
You are loved, punkin.

38:34.252 --> 38:36.369
You are not alone.

38:44.475 --> 38:45.642
Aah, I pricked my thumb!

38:45.643 --> 38:47.477
Okay, Costume Committee?

38:47.478 --> 38:48.845
Sucks.

38:48.846 --> 38:50.096
Why do we have
to do all the work?

38:50.097 --> 38:51.481
Quinn says
it's because we're the newbies,

38:51.482 --> 38:53.182
- and we gotta pay our dues.
- Whatever.

38:53.183 --> 38:56.069
It's ridick the seniors treat us
like plebes.

38:56.070 --> 38:57.987
I mean, this is Rachel
Berry's dress, right?

38:57.988 --> 38:59.639
She should sew it herself.

38:59.640 --> 39:02.475
Rachel is probably practicing
her songs right now,

39:02.476 --> 39:03.809
over and over again,

39:03.810 --> 39:05.612
until her vocal chords bleed.

39:05.613 --> 39:07.614
And none of us would
be going to Chicago

39:07.615 --> 39:09.549
if not for her commitment
to Glee Club,

39:09.550 --> 39:11.000
so show some respect.

39:11.001 --> 39:12.952
While we're acting like
shrubbery in the background?

39:12.953 --> 39:15.455
Put in the work...

39:15.456 --> 39:17.123
be a good team player,

39:17.124 --> 39:18.824
and you'll get your solos.

39:18.825 --> 39:20.293
And maybe next year
it'll be

39:20.294 --> 39:22.795
as part of a group
that won Nationals.

39:22.796 --> 39:24.830
And this costume
is yours, Sugar,

39:24.831 --> 39:26.799
but I'm happy
to be sewing it.

39:26.800 --> 39:29.018
Because the truth is,

39:29.019 --> 39:32.722
it takes a lot of crystals
to make something shine.

39:39.563 --> 39:42.231
Now, that's great, and then
we shift to the Trouble Tones

39:42.232 --> 39:44.150
for Gaga's "Edge of Glory,"
which is up-tempo.

39:44.151 --> 39:46.786
I like this.
This will work.

39:46.787 --> 39:49.739
William, I can taste
your Axe Body Spray.

39:50.958 --> 39:51.958
Hey, you.

39:51.959 --> 39:54.577
Going somewhere, Shannon?

39:54.578 --> 39:56.913
I'd like to be a chaperone
for Nationals.

39:56.914 --> 39:59.165
I'll pay my own way
and I'll sleep on the bus.

39:59.166 --> 40:01.367
You don't have to
sleep on the bus.

40:01.368 --> 40:03.252
I'm sure we
can make room.

40:03.253 --> 40:05.004
I booked an executive
maternity suite.

40:05.005 --> 40:07.307
Sharing it wouldn't be fair
to the baby.

40:07.308 --> 40:09.509
You can bunk with me and Emma.

40:09.510 --> 40:13.313
So you packed a bag on the off-chance
you'd be coming to Chicago?

40:13.314 --> 40:17.183
I left him.

40:25.058 --> 40:26.609
Welcome aboard, Shannon.

40:29.196 --> 40:32.031
If it wasn't for Tina, I would never
have gone to see Carmen Tibideaux.

40:32.032 --> 40:34.334
Yeah, she's like
an offensive lineman.

40:34.335 --> 40:35.752
She always in the trenches,

40:35.753 --> 40:37.787
picking up blitzers so the
quarterback can lead the drive.

40:37.788 --> 40:40.590
Sorry, you lost me at
"offensive lineman,"

40:40.591 --> 40:43.209
but I'm sure whatever
you said was really nice.

40:43.210 --> 40:46.262
All right, there's no other option
but just to exceed all expectations.

40:46.263 --> 40:48.014
We have to win
at Nationals.

40:48.015 --> 40:49.265
There's no alternative.

40:49.266 --> 40:50.633
You know, you really
are our "Unique Factor."

40:50.634 --> 40:52.435
Ah, it's

40:52.436 --> 40:54.804
"You know, I did hundreds
and hundreds of movies.

40:54.805 --> 40:57.523
Now, two mice jumped
into a bucket of cream and..."

40:57.524 --> 40:59.091
No, no, I think we all are.

40:59.092 --> 41:00.810
I mean, in a sea full of kids

41:00.811 --> 41:02.928
who are just desperately
clinging to their own kind,

41:02.929 --> 41:04.230
we're different.

41:04.231 --> 41:07.400
We took the time
to get to know each other

41:07.401 --> 41:09.369
and reach out
and accept one other.

41:09.370 --> 41:11.604
That's our "Unique Factor."

41:11.605 --> 41:13.823
And that's what I love about us.

41:13.824 --> 41:15.708
Yeah, me, too.
