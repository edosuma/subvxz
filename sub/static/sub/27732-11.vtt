WEBVTT

00:42.959 --> 00:45.462
-No!

00:54.387 --> 00:55.555
How's he doing?

00:56.097 --> 01:01.728
He's a mess. He's got multiple lacerations
to the face, torso, arms and legs.

01:01.811 --> 01:04.689
He's lost a lot of blood.
Can't even guess the internal injuries.

01:06.733 --> 01:08.485
No!

01:11.029 --> 01:12.655
What the hell happened to him?

01:13.156 --> 01:14.616
He killed a bunch of people.

01:15.658 --> 01:16.785
That's what he does.

01:17.452 --> 01:20.330
Yeah? Somebody might have
returned the favor.

01:20.413 --> 01:22.832
-Whoa! Whoa!
-Hey, hey. Easy, easy, easy.

01:25.919 --> 01:27.587
Scale of one to ten,
what's your pain level?

01:32.342 --> 01:33.593
No!

01:37.931 --> 01:40.225
-Can someone remove these cuffs?
-The cuffs stay on.

01:40.308 --> 01:42.310
-I need two bags of saline.
-Got it.

01:43.269 --> 01:44.270
BP's 80 over 50.

01:44.354 --> 01:47.148
Resting heart rate is 120.
Give me 50 micrograms of phentermine.

01:47.232 --> 01:49.484
Someone close these curtains, please.
Surgery prep.

03:14.068 --> 03:15.653
Amy, it's Curtis.

03:26.664 --> 03:27.749
Where's Frank?

03:30.168 --> 03:31.085
Curtis.

03:32.170 --> 03:33.254
Curtis, where is he?

03:34.255 --> 03:37.008
What happened

03:38.009 --> 03:39.010
Curtis.

03:43.056 --> 03:44.140
Is he dead?

03:44.933 --> 03:45.767
No.

03:47.685 --> 03:49.145
Okay, well, then why is he--

03:49.229 --> 03:50.813
I don't know what happened.

03:51.356 --> 03:53.650
Frank went in there,
and the shit hit the fan--

03:53.733 --> 03:55.693
Okay, so what

03:57.737 --> 03:58.988
The police got him.

04:00.406 --> 04:01.991
They put him in an ambulance.

04:04.494 --> 04:05.495
That's...

04:05.578 --> 04:07.705
Okay.

04:08.498 --> 04:12.043
How bad Was he...

04:12.126 --> 04:14.420
-Curtis, what happened to him?
-I don't know.

04:14.504 --> 04:16.256
-Was it Billy?
-I don't know.

04:16.339 --> 04:17.924
Well, you must know something.

04:18.007 --> 04:22.804
I know I killed a man and shot others.
That's what I know.

04:23.721 --> 04:26.891
I've held men as they were dying,
many men...

04:27.809 --> 04:32.397
but never one that I put there myself,
not one with my bullet still in him.

04:34.857 --> 04:37.277
I never realized
how different it would feel.

04:49.539 --> 04:52.959
With our rock-bottom
prices and 100 percent financing...

04:53.793 --> 04:56.045
...known as
the Punisher was arrested today

04:56.129 --> 04:59.507
in what appears to be a massive shoot-out
at a warehouse in Queens.

04:59.590 --> 05:02.176
Reports are coming in
of several fatalities.

05:02.260 --> 05:04.137
Castle was taken into police custody

05:04.220 --> 05:07.390
and is being treated for injuries
at Sacred Saints Hospital.

05:07.473 --> 05:11.394
No further details about the incident
or his condition are available at--

05:13.521 --> 05:14.689
We have to get him out.

05:14.772 --> 05:16.482
-Now.
-Amy, don't.

05:16.566 --> 05:18.693
Look, if he's at the hospital,
that means he's hurt.

05:19.235 --> 05:20.361
Forget the cops.

05:20.445 --> 05:23.740
Curtis, every hit man in town
is gonna go after that five million.

05:23.823 --> 05:27.410
-We have to help him.
-Amy, helping him is what put us here.

05:27.994 --> 05:29.370
And what are we gonna do, huh?

05:29.454 --> 05:32.373
Run down to the hospital
with guns blazing to bust him out?

05:33.750 --> 05:34.751
It's done.

05:37.420 --> 05:38.463
I'm done.

05:41.007 --> 05:42.258
So that's it, huh?

05:43.217 --> 05:44.635
That's all you're gonna do?

05:46.846 --> 05:50.475
I'm gonna take a shower.
That's what I'm gonna do.

07:04.966 --> 07:06.801
And you are loved.

07:08.302 --> 07:09.220
Finish this.

07:10.263 --> 07:11.472
Come home to me.

07:25.236 --> 07:26.487
Pilgrim residence.

07:27.488 --> 07:30.032
-Eliza.
-Hello, John.

07:31.784 --> 07:35.705
Could I speak with Rebecca, please?
I've missed her previous calls.

07:35.788 --> 07:37.665
Yes, we've been trying to reach you.

07:38.583 --> 07:39.584
Is something wrong?

07:41.794 --> 07:45.131
Rebecca's resting right now, John,
but if you stay by the phone...

07:45.214 --> 07:47.133
Then who just called me?

07:47.758 --> 07:48.843
That was me.

07:48.926 --> 07:52.054
I promised Rebecca
I'd try and get hold of you.

07:53.306 --> 07:55.558
She was worried about you.

07:56.142 --> 07:57.935
-We all were.
-Yeah, well, um...

07:59.645 --> 08:00.771
I'm all right.

08:01.564 --> 08:03.191
Stay by the phone then, John.

08:04.066 --> 08:05.693
I will. I'm not going anywhere.

08:06.819 --> 08:08.112
Are you all right, John?

08:11.449 --> 08:13.701
Yeah, I just need to hear her voice.

08:16.871 --> 08:17.872
Yeah.

08:20.833 --> 08:24.086
Being away makes you understand
you're not as strong as you think.

08:26.380 --> 08:27.673
I'll wait.

08:28.591 --> 08:29.717
All right, John.

08:56.911 --> 09:00.081
Injury prevention
coordinator, call 2345.

09:00.164 --> 09:03.000
Injury prevention coordinator,
call 2345.

09:04.168 --> 09:05.461
Hello.

09:05.545 --> 09:08.923
Ma'am, this area is restricted.
Hospital staff and police only.

09:09.006 --> 09:12.260
Yeah, I'm Karen Page.
I work with Nelson and Murdock.

09:12.343 --> 09:14.303
They're Mr. Castle's lawyers of record.

09:14.845 --> 09:16.764
Uh, I have strict orders.

09:17.265 --> 09:18.266
All right.

09:18.933 --> 09:23.604
Uh, Officer Smith, you know
what else is strict? The Bill of Rights.

09:24.146 --> 09:25.439
Especially the Sixth Amendment,

09:25.523 --> 09:28.067
which establishes a defendant's right
to the assistance of counsel.

09:29.360 --> 09:31.904
Furthermore, neither the federal
nor the state government

09:31.988 --> 09:34.657
may deprive a person
of their legal rights. That's due process.

09:35.908 --> 09:37.827
Look, the only reason that I'm saying this

09:37.910 --> 09:40.997
is so that you realize that by keeping
me from conferring with my client,

09:41.080 --> 09:43.749
we're risking a mistrial
and Frank Castle walking free.

09:44.292 --> 09:45.585
Now, I am sure

09:45.668 --> 09:49.589
that your coworkers at the precinct
would not appreciate that, now would they?

09:50.590 --> 09:51.799
No, I guess not.

09:54.427 --> 09:57.597
-All right, just go. Just go.
-Thank you. Thank you very much.

09:59.390 --> 10:01.100
She's good. It's his lawyer.

11:23.641 --> 11:26.143
Frank? Hey.

11:30.564 --> 11:32.108
How are you feeling?

11:35.111 --> 11:37.321
It's kind of familiar, isn't it?

11:40.741 --> 11:41.742
So, um...

11:44.078 --> 11:45.621
I watched the news.

11:47.289 --> 11:50.000
I'm assuming this has something
to do with Billy Russo.

11:52.628 --> 11:55.047
What

11:58.926 --> 11:59.927
Frank?

12:02.847 --> 12:04.223
You should walk away.

12:06.559 --> 12:09.019
What

12:10.354 --> 12:11.689
You know better than that.

12:13.899 --> 12:16.527
Besides, I don't really think
you want me to go.

12:17.319 --> 12:18.195
Look, it's a...

12:19.071 --> 12:20.281
It's a tough situation.

12:20.865 --> 12:22.658
It's nothing we haven't dealt with before.

12:23.200 --> 12:25.035
We just have to figure out
what to do about it.

12:28.831 --> 12:29.874
I did it.

12:32.084 --> 12:35.463
Karen... I killed three women.

12:41.886 --> 12:43.012
Maybe I could help.

12:47.725 --> 12:49.351
Yeah, you're not gonna fix this.

12:50.644 --> 12:51.645
Okay?

12:52.229 --> 12:54.273
Doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter what you did.

12:55.149 --> 12:56.942
It doesn't change how I feel about you.

12:59.153 --> 13:00.154
It should.

13:02.823 --> 13:04.158
It doesn't.

13:27.973 --> 13:29.391
Make sure you tag all those,

13:29.475 --> 13:31.894
and make sure
nobody goes up there, indefinitely.

13:32.728 --> 13:35.105
Special Agent in Charge Madani.

13:36.106 --> 13:37.441
Quite something, huh?

13:37.525 --> 13:39.902
-Thanks for letting me in.
-Well, I wanted you to see this.

13:39.985 --> 13:41.695
See what all your bullshit led to.

13:42.279 --> 13:44.156
It seems Castle forgot his code, huh?

13:45.491 --> 13:47.493
Castle came in via an underground tunnel.

13:48.077 --> 13:51.956
We found a ton of evidence...
and some dead bodies.

13:52.039 --> 13:55.709
Castle took out several men wearing masks
just like this one.

13:58.629 --> 14:01.674
Well, we both know someone else
who wore a mask like that.

14:01.757 --> 14:03.342
Castle came here after Russo.

14:03.425 --> 14:07.304
Yeah, probably. But the weird thing is,

14:07.388 --> 14:09.849
it looks like they knew he was coming
and they didn't kill him.

14:09.932 --> 14:11.976
We found rock salt, rubber bullets.

14:12.726 --> 14:14.687
Castle is beat half to death.

14:18.524 --> 14:20.234
Russo wanted Castle to suffer.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.028
I don't give a damn
what any of them wanted.

14:23.654 --> 14:26.407
I've got three dead women
who had nothing to with any of this shit.

14:34.081 --> 14:35.249
Come with me.

14:45.384 --> 14:47.845
There was three dead
unarmed women laying there.

14:49.471 --> 14:50.639
Shot to hell.

14:51.181 --> 14:53.851
Their bodies are on the way
to the hospital morgue right now.

14:53.934 --> 14:57.813
Castle came up here like a madman
and shot the shit out of this place.

14:59.148 --> 15:02.192
Best guess is Russo was up here
using the women for cover,

15:02.276 --> 15:03.736
and Castle just...

15:04.445 --> 15:08.240
-shot right through 'em.
-No, that's not how Frank operates.

15:08.324 --> 15:11.994
We arrested him standing over their bodies
with the gun still in his hand.

15:12.828 --> 15:16.040
Now, he may not have planned on it,
but he did it.

15:16.749 --> 15:18.334
And he ain't saying different.

15:21.337 --> 15:22.421
What is he saying?

15:23.005 --> 15:24.965
-He ain't saying shit.
-But nothing about Russo?

15:25.049 --> 15:27.134
About what happened

15:30.054 --> 15:31.847
How you feeling right now, Dinah?

15:37.394 --> 15:38.395
Awful.

15:41.690 --> 15:42.691
Sick.

15:45.277 --> 15:46.904
Does that make you happy?

15:52.201 --> 15:53.744
Would you let me talk to him?

15:54.536 --> 15:58.332
-Why would I do that?
-He might speak to me.

15:59.667 --> 16:00.668
And what?

16:01.210 --> 16:03.921
-Get your story straight?
-Okay, I guess I deserve that.

16:04.004 --> 16:08.133
Maybe I could get him to give us Russo.
We could finish this once and for all.

16:08.217 --> 16:11.303
-And you'll give Russo to me?
-Yes. You have my word.

16:17.059 --> 16:17.893
Uh...

16:19.103 --> 16:21.939
What the hell? Can't hurt.

16:23.565 --> 16:27.027
I'll call the hospital,
tell 'em to let you in.

16:38.747 --> 16:40.916
Hey, sleepyhead.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.793
-Hi.

17:08.736 --> 17:11.155
Frank! Hey, hey.

17:11.238 --> 17:12.448
-Wait...
-It's okay.

17:12.531 --> 17:14.116
God damn.

17:14.199 --> 17:15.909
What's that all about, huh?

17:16.869 --> 17:19.121
This dream is always the goddamn same.

17:20.664 --> 17:21.665
Christ.

17:29.631 --> 17:31.008
We just loved doing that.

17:34.636 --> 17:35.971
Maria and the kids...

17:38.599 --> 17:40.851
They're there, but I can't reach 'em.
You know, I...

17:44.521 --> 17:47.524
I can't tell them
that the monster's coming.

17:49.234 --> 17:54.782
Day they died, I told Maria
that I was done, that I wasn't going back.

17:57.117 --> 17:58.911
I'd just got home the night before.

18:00.996 --> 18:04.249
And when I woke up, I saw her face.
It just came at me.

18:04.333 --> 18:06.168
But, like, the second it did, I knew...

18:08.837 --> 18:09.922
it was right.

18:14.426 --> 18:17.096
It was like this...

18:17.596 --> 18:21.225
this weight got...
got lifted off my shoulders, you know?

18:21.308 --> 18:23.977
For both of us, you know?
She knew it was right. The kids, too.

18:24.061 --> 18:26.105
I was just ready, you know? It was time.

18:27.439 --> 18:30.651
I just... I wanted to be with them.

18:30.734 --> 18:32.569
But that day, we went to that park,

18:32.653 --> 18:34.655
and the kids were too old
for that stupid carousel,

18:34.738 --> 18:36.532
but that day they just laughed, you know?

18:39.076 --> 18:40.285
They were laughing.

18:41.411 --> 18:43.747
We were all laughing like idiots.
And then...

18:45.541 --> 18:48.043
And that laughter,
it stuck with me, you know?

18:49.211 --> 18:51.046
After I lost them, it would just...

18:52.589 --> 18:54.299
It would echo, you know? It was...

18:54.675 --> 18:55.592
over and over.

18:55.676 --> 18:57.636
And it wasn't just in my dreams.
It was, like...

18:58.554 --> 19:00.389
It was in my heart, you know?
And I just...

19:00.472 --> 19:01.598
I wanted to hold onto it.

19:01.682 --> 19:04.101
I wanted to live in it
and just hear that laughter, but...

19:06.145 --> 19:08.147
Thing is, I can't hear it anymore.

19:09.648 --> 19:13.152
It's all I had. It's gone. It's gone.

19:13.777 --> 19:15.279
You know, and all I have is...

19:16.238 --> 19:19.158
the looks on their faces after the bullets
ripped through their bodies.

19:19.241 --> 19:21.869
You see, the thing is, Karen,
is they had time, yeah?

19:22.536 --> 19:25.205
They didn't die straight away.
They had time.

19:26.707 --> 19:28.959
My son, Frankie, you know, he...

19:29.042 --> 19:31.461
he tried to be brave,
he tried to fight, but...

19:32.254 --> 19:34.590
My daughter, too.
They just looked at me like...

19:36.091 --> 19:37.426
like, "Why, Daddy?"

19:37.968 --> 19:40.554
They didn't understand.
Like, "Why "

19:41.722 --> 19:43.348
I think about those women, you know?

19:44.933 --> 19:46.560
What were their faces like, you know?

19:46.643 --> 19:49.313
What were they thinking about
when my bullets, my bullshit, when it...

19:49.730 --> 19:51.899
ripped right through them
and ended everything they had--

19:51.982 --> 19:53.525
Frank, no, you didn't know.

19:53.609 --> 19:56.028
-You didn't know they were there.
-It's not that I didn't know.

19:58.238 --> 20:01.116
I didn't care. I didn't care.

20:02.159 --> 20:04.912
Right then, I would've killed
anything that got in my way.

20:09.291 --> 20:11.251
You know what that means, right?

20:14.087 --> 20:15.505
Now I'm the monster.

20:17.216 --> 20:18.217
Yeah.

20:19.551 --> 20:23.013
If any of those pieces of shit
that I killed, if they deserved to die...

20:24.723 --> 20:25.766
so do I.

20:49.665 --> 20:51.667
...nurse to the ER, stat.

20:51.750 --> 20:53.752
Any available cardiac care nurse
to the ER, stat.

20:59.132 --> 21:00.425
Afternoon, Officer.

21:00.509 --> 21:05.138
Dr. Mason sent me down to perform
a neurological exam on, uh, Frank Castle.

21:05.973 --> 21:08.267
-Is he down here?
-Yeah.

21:08.809 --> 21:12.062
You look too young to be a nurse,
if you don't mind me saying.

21:12.145 --> 21:15.148
Mind

21:15.732 --> 21:18.277
But I am registered and everything.

21:18.944 --> 21:20.946
-Mary Morrison.
-All right, got ya.

21:21.947 --> 21:25.075
So, this guy,
is he dangerous or something?

21:25.158 --> 21:27.035
Nah. He's beat to shit.

21:27.619 --> 21:28.787
And he's cuffed, but--

21:28.870 --> 21:32.916
Right. What's he gonna do, right

21:35.085 --> 21:37.004
Now, can I get this done, please?

21:38.422 --> 21:39.798
Yeah, you can go. Come on.

21:46.388 --> 21:47.389
She's good.

21:53.020 --> 21:54.521
You need to leave.

21:54.604 --> 21:57.024
I'm here to perform an exam,
and he has to get naked.

21:57.107 --> 21:58.317
Jesus Christ.

21:58.400 --> 22:00.360
What -Who are you?

22:00.902 --> 22:05.699
Uh, I'm Karen Page, and I'm guessing
that you're not a nurse. Who are you?

22:07.326 --> 22:09.161
-Frank?
-Nobody. She's nobody.

22:09.244 --> 22:10.329
Yeah, that's right.

22:10.412 --> 22:12.039
I'm the nobody who came to get you out.

22:12.122 --> 22:13.957
-God damn it.
-Thanks a bunch.

22:14.624 --> 22:16.335
-You look awful.

22:16.418 --> 22:18.503
Can you, like, move or anything?

22:18.587 --> 22:20.505
No? Well, it doesn't matter.
You're gonna have to.

22:20.589 --> 22:22.382
Hey. God damn it.

22:24.384 --> 22:25.385
Listen to me, Frank.

22:25.469 --> 22:27.220
We have to get out of here
before they come.

22:27.304 --> 22:29.014
-You need to leave now.
-Who's "they"?

22:29.097 --> 22:31.516
"They" is every hit man in New York.

22:31.600 --> 22:33.518
There's a five million dollar bounty
on our heads,

22:33.602 --> 22:35.771
and it's pretty easy to collect
with you cuffed to a bed.

22:35.854 --> 22:37.481
Is that true

22:37.564 --> 22:39.983
Well, shit.
Looks like the gang's all here.

22:40.067 --> 22:41.318
-Karen.
-Dinah.

22:41.401 --> 22:43.111
Madani, you need to get her out of here.

22:43.195 --> 22:44.905
She's in danger.
She needs to be protected.

22:44.988 --> 22:46.865
Is this from the man
in the black hat again?

22:46.948 --> 22:49.951
No, apparently they need protection
from every hit man in New York.

22:50.035 --> 22:51.620
Or so she says. Whoever she is.

22:51.703 --> 22:54.623
She is Frank's new little helper.
You should watch your purse with her.

22:54.706 --> 22:57.542
-Look, why are hit men after you?
-It's a long story. I don't--

22:57.626 --> 23:00.462
God. She'll tell you the whole thing
once you get out of here.

23:00.545 --> 23:02.881
-It is not safe for you to be here.

23:02.964 --> 23:04.758
Well, I'm not leaving without you.

23:04.841 --> 23:05.842
Can't you just, like,

23:05.926 --> 23:08.220
wave your stupid badge around
or something

23:08.303 --> 23:09.262
No, I can't.

23:10.347 --> 23:13.558
Well, he's gonna get killed either here or
in jail. Either one, he doesn't deserve.

23:13.642 --> 23:15.977
-Will you please help me get him out?

23:16.061 --> 23:18.188
I wanna help, but we can't
just walk him out like this.

23:18.271 --> 23:20.399
Didn't I ask you to stay with Curtis

23:21.149 --> 23:22.401
-What did I say to you?
-Madani.

23:22.484 --> 23:23.777
How's our boy doing?

23:25.695 --> 23:27.656
-I see you, Dinah...

23:30.951 --> 23:33.161
...no matter how many locks
you put on your door.

23:33.245 --> 23:34.454
And I see Frank,

23:34.538 --> 23:36.665
no matter how many cops
you surround him with.

23:39.167 --> 23:40.919
Are you gonna visit him every day?

23:42.295 --> 23:43.713
Like you visited me?

23:45.757 --> 23:48.260
So why don't you come down here, Billy

23:48.969 --> 23:50.345
Can he hear me?

23:50.887 --> 23:51.888
Yes.

23:54.850 --> 23:56.435
How's it feel, Frankie?

23:58.562 --> 24:00.939
To be locked up in a cage like an animal?

24:03.400 --> 24:05.068
To be confined to a room

24:05.152 --> 24:07.904
with nothing but your miserable thoughts
to comfort you?

24:09.197 --> 24:11.074
Nothing temporary about that pain.

24:12.325 --> 24:14.202
It's like a waking death.

24:14.744 --> 24:17.789
Like you're burning in hell. Yeah.

24:19.624 --> 24:22.252
Yeah, you're your own devil now,
Frankie boy.

24:24.296 --> 24:26.173
And you are no better than me.

24:27.632 --> 24:28.633
Are you done, Bill?

24:28.717 --> 24:30.510
No, you, you're done!

24:33.054 --> 24:36.433
And every day, you'll remember
that I'm the one that put you there.

24:37.726 --> 24:40.187
Isn't that just how it goes?

24:41.938 --> 24:43.064
I win, Frank.

24:45.400 --> 24:46.401
I win.

25:08.882 --> 25:10.800
You put him exactly where we planned.

25:11.384 --> 25:13.053
Yeah, well...

25:16.806 --> 25:18.558
Sometimes that's just not enough.

25:18.642 --> 25:21.394
What else is there

25:22.979 --> 25:25.106
Well, the thing about getting
what you wanted is that...

25:26.733 --> 25:28.527
sometimes it's a disappointment.

25:29.236 --> 25:33.490
The getting it is the thing.
And then afterwards, you feel kinda...

25:34.824 --> 25:35.825
hollow.

25:37.160 --> 25:39.079
I wanted to make you happy...

25:39.621 --> 25:42.290
to find some release
so we could move forward.

25:42.374 --> 25:44.543
But I guess I'm not getting
what I want either.

25:46.795 --> 25:51.132
It was a dark thing... that we did.

26:00.934 --> 26:02.143
How do you feel?

26:02.978 --> 26:06.064
I mean, those women, they're...
they're dead because of you.

26:11.778 --> 26:13.196
I didn't know them.

26:16.283 --> 26:20.579
They died hard, Krista.

26:23.873 --> 26:25.417
Are you blaming me for...

26:31.840 --> 26:34.342
I'm afraid that one day you will blame me.

26:38.888 --> 26:41.808
You wanted to know how to get Castle
where you wanted him.

26:43.393 --> 26:46.104
I did that. For you. For us.

26:47.188 --> 26:50.442
I'd do anything for us to be happy.

26:53.528 --> 26:56.489
I think we both deserve
to be happy together.

27:01.119 --> 27:03.955
But we need to leave before they find you.

27:04.039 --> 27:05.373
The police still want you.

27:05.915 --> 27:08.960
And we have to go
and leave everything we've done behind.

27:13.465 --> 27:14.549
Are you sure?

27:15.967 --> 27:16.843
Hmm.

27:18.386 --> 27:22.557
Are you sure that you want to give up
everything that you've built?

27:23.391 --> 27:24.934
Everything that you worked so hard for?

27:27.437 --> 27:28.563
Are you sure?

27:31.274 --> 27:32.275
For me?

27:34.694 --> 27:35.862
What are you saying?

27:40.033 --> 27:41.743
I'm saying...

27:45.288 --> 27:46.998
I'm saying it's not too late.

27:47.916 --> 27:49.417
Nobody knows who you are.

27:50.502 --> 27:51.544
I would know.

27:53.338 --> 27:56.633
My whole life, I've felt like...
I've felt alone.

27:57.967 --> 27:59.010
But not now.

28:01.304 --> 28:02.931
You and I together, we...

28:04.641 --> 28:06.017
we can have anything.

28:06.851 --> 28:09.604
Yes.

28:10.730 --> 28:12.315
Yes. Yes.

28:17.320 --> 28:18.697
You make me happy.

28:21.074 --> 28:22.450
You make me so happy.

28:38.800 --> 28:39.801
All finished.

28:41.052 --> 28:42.095
How's he doing?

28:43.680 --> 28:46.182
Uh, he's a very sick man.

28:46.266 --> 28:48.226
-Yeah, no shit.
-Yeah.

28:50.353 --> 28:53.022
-My next lucky customer.

29:02.866 --> 29:03.992
This is new.

29:05.326 --> 29:07.996
Those women,
I don't figure Frank for that.

29:09.456 --> 29:10.540
But you don't...

29:12.041 --> 29:15.503
You don't have doubts, do you

29:16.171 --> 29:19.966
No, I'm here because this is
as much my mess as it is his.

29:21.718 --> 29:23.553
I'm the one who brought him back.

29:26.639 --> 29:30.643
I don't know. Maybe I'm just looking
for ways to let us off the hook...

29:32.145 --> 29:33.146
But?

29:34.397 --> 29:37.025
Come on, I hear a "but."

29:37.108 --> 29:41.279
But there are a whole load of things
at the crime scene that don't add up.

29:43.406 --> 29:44.866
And Billy calling like that.

29:45.533 --> 29:48.620
I mean, maybe if there was some way
to see the bodies...

29:48.703 --> 29:49.829
So what's stopping you?

29:49.913 --> 29:53.166
This is Mahoney's case. He let me
talk to Frank because it suited him.

29:53.249 --> 29:55.001
There's no way
he'll let me do anything else.

29:56.127 --> 29:57.420
I wouldn't if I was him.

29:58.797 --> 29:59.923
Look...

30:00.006 --> 30:02.801
Look, if there's even the slightest chance
that Frank didn't do this,

30:02.884 --> 30:03.968
we have to check that out.

30:04.052 --> 30:06.513
We need to be sure.

30:07.388 --> 30:09.682
I mean, Frank seems pretty sure in there.

30:11.267 --> 30:13.186
What if I could get you in the morgue?

30:14.938 --> 30:16.272
Take a look at the bodies.

30:18.817 --> 30:20.527
How the hell are you gonna manage that?

30:46.469 --> 30:47.470
John.

30:49.848 --> 30:50.932
What happened?

30:53.560 --> 30:55.728
-John...
-What happened?

30:57.230 --> 30:59.357
She went peacefully last night.

31:00.400 --> 31:02.527
-Please, John, let us pray together.
-Stop. Stop.

31:02.610 --> 31:03.945
Last night

31:06.573 --> 31:07.490
Come home to me.

31:09.993 --> 31:11.870
She brought me back. There's...

31:12.912 --> 31:15.248
What's that? John.

31:19.002 --> 31:20.003
Oh, John.

31:20.086 --> 31:22.714
No. She was here.

31:36.811 --> 31:37.854
Hey, Ed.

31:41.566 --> 31:43.610
Things just got a whole lot brighter
down here.

31:43.693 --> 31:45.069
How's my favorite investigator?

31:45.153 --> 31:46.779
Actually, in need of a favor.

31:47.697 --> 31:50.408
-Oh, this is Homeland SAC Dinah Madani.
-Hi.

31:50.491 --> 31:52.452
-She's a friend of mine.
-Homeland, huh?

31:52.952 --> 31:55.121
Well, a treasure to meet you.

31:58.541 --> 32:00.668
You come to see the ME?
'Cause he's not here right now.

32:00.752 --> 32:02.962
No, please.
I came for information straight up.

32:03.046 --> 32:04.631
So I came to you.

32:04.714 --> 32:06.841
You know more about what happens
here than anyone else.

32:08.968 --> 32:11.179
Look, I was kind of hoping
that we could view

32:11.262 --> 32:13.514
the bodies of the three
female victims that came in

32:13.598 --> 32:15.224
from the Frank Castle shoot-out
last night.

32:15.308 --> 32:16.768
They haven't been processed, right?

32:16.851 --> 32:19.437
No, they're on the docket
for first thing tomorrow.

32:20.146 --> 32:23.024
-That's kind of a tall order, Karen.
-Yeah, I know. I'm sorry, but...

32:23.858 --> 32:25.485
Look, Ed, I'd owe you big time.

32:28.988 --> 32:30.031
How big?

32:34.994 --> 32:36.788
Okay. Yup.

32:37.497 --> 32:38.623
-Really?
-Mmm-hmm.

32:54.055 --> 32:56.307
They were all brought in
first thing this morning.

32:56.391 --> 32:57.642
Messy. Not nice at all.

32:57.725 --> 32:58.768
You examined them?

32:59.394 --> 33:01.604
Sure did. Same as everyone down here.

33:02.146 --> 33:04.190
Always good to know everything
you can know, you know?

33:04.273 --> 33:05.441
Do you mind if I take a look?

33:05.525 --> 33:08.653
Actually... Ed, why don't you tell us
what you saw?

33:09.612 --> 33:12.031
-You squeamish?
-I'll get by.

33:14.075 --> 33:14.993
All righty then.

33:18.371 --> 33:20.164
All three died by gunshot wound.

33:20.248 --> 33:23.543
This one had three, right?
Any of them could have been fatal.

33:23.626 --> 33:25.920
At that range, it was gonna be hard
for anyone to survive.

33:26.004 --> 33:27.463
Uh, sorry...

33:27.547 --> 33:28.965
What do you mean by "that range"?

33:30.049 --> 33:33.011
Uh, well, see, they... they still have...

33:33.803 --> 33:36.723
gunpowder grains around the entry sites.

33:36.806 --> 33:38.099
-See?
-Yeah.

33:38.182 --> 33:42.478
So the shooter was only a few feet
from the victims.

33:46.024 --> 33:48.151
What was the trajectory
of the entry wounds?

33:48.234 --> 33:50.361
The exit wound
was straight through, right?

33:50.445 --> 33:51.821
Parallel to the ground.

33:51.904 --> 33:55.450
Looks to me like someone stood
right in front of this girl

33:55.533 --> 33:56.659
and unloaded right into her.

34:00.872 --> 34:02.749
And that's the same with all three?

34:02.832 --> 34:04.083
Yeah.

34:04.959 --> 34:07.045
Okay. Then I've seen enough.

34:30.151 --> 34:32.653
The way they were shot doesn't fit.
They were executed,

34:32.737 --> 34:34.197
not caught in the crossfire.

34:34.781 --> 34:36.824
Okay, tell me that means
Frank didn't kill them.

34:36.908 --> 34:37.909
Yes.

34:59.180 --> 35:01.390
Anything else
I could help you pretty ladies with?

35:01.474 --> 35:06.187
Uh... No, Ed. Thank you.
Really, you've been great.

35:07.563 --> 35:10.149
Thanks for your help. Um...

35:10.233 --> 35:12.235
You should work with the police more.

35:12.318 --> 35:15.279
I've tried several times. You know...

35:15.363 --> 35:17.115
I mean, at the end of the day, um...

35:18.157 --> 35:21.744
they wouldn't hire me.
People... think I'm a little strange.

35:21.828 --> 35:25.873
They call me Creepy Ed. They think I can't hear 'em, but I can.

35:25.957 --> 35:29.252
-Thanks. We've got to get...
-My senses are acute.

35:29.836 --> 35:31.254
-You know--
-Karen.

35:42.515 --> 35:43.850
You don't like that, huh?

35:46.310 --> 35:49.730
I mean, unless we're having sex or...

35:51.440 --> 35:52.942
it's causing you pain.

35:54.735 --> 35:57.113
Remember when I asked you
about your dreams?

35:57.738 --> 35:59.782
-Yeah?
-It's the same thing.

36:01.409 --> 36:04.245
But I hated that,
because I didn't remember.

36:05.621 --> 36:08.124
I hate that I do. I'm gonna make tea.

36:08.207 --> 36:10.042
Hey, hey. Whoa, whoa. Sit down.

36:12.753 --> 36:15.548
You know everything about me.

36:16.591 --> 36:20.469
I mean, you got the files,
the lawyers, cops...

36:21.470 --> 36:22.638
everything I ever did.

36:23.264 --> 36:26.642
Pretty much anything I ever...
I ever felt.

36:30.021 --> 36:31.063
But you, I...

36:35.109 --> 36:37.987
I really don't know anything.

36:38.946 --> 36:40.448
I told you to ask once.

36:41.032 --> 36:43.701
Yeah. Yeah, and you told me...

36:44.660 --> 36:47.079
You told me that you fell as a kid.

36:47.163 --> 36:48.247
I did.

36:48.331 --> 36:50.124
Yeah, but that's like me...

36:50.958 --> 36:53.169
That's like me telling you
that I hurt my shoulder.

36:54.587 --> 36:57.256
There's the fact,
and then there's what it means.

36:58.299 --> 37:02.678
And whatever those scars mean to you,
they led us here, to me, to you...

37:03.346 --> 37:04.764
to everything we've done.

37:09.560 --> 37:10.853
We killed people.

37:13.689 --> 37:14.732
Together.

37:16.067 --> 37:16.901
We killed people

37:16.984 --> 37:21.030
as sure as if you were standing next to me
and pulling the trigger.

37:26.077 --> 37:27.495
I did that to save you.

37:28.913 --> 37:30.289
Yeah.

37:31.749 --> 37:33.501
And why is that so important?

37:38.547 --> 37:39.840
Because I love you.

37:45.012 --> 37:47.640
And you love me
because you think that I need saving.

37:51.727 --> 37:52.853
Who was KM?

37:54.981 --> 37:56.857
-Hmm?
-In my file...

37:59.151 --> 38:00.611
you said that I was like him.

38:04.615 --> 38:05.700
Yes and no.

38:07.201 --> 38:08.703
Did you love him, too?

38:10.288 --> 38:11.289
Yes.

38:20.339 --> 38:21.882
He was my father.

38:23.217 --> 38:27.680
He was a soldier in the army.
Two tours of Vietnam.

38:28.723 --> 38:32.184
And afterwards, he... struggled.

38:34.937 --> 38:37.273
He loved us. He tried. But there was...

38:38.858 --> 38:40.151
no one there to help him.

38:40.234 --> 38:43.195
And I was just a kid,
so I didn't know how to reach him.

38:45.448 --> 38:47.575
One night, I woke up
to him yelling at my mother.

38:48.367 --> 38:50.953
And I learned later
that she wanted a divorce.

38:53.331 --> 38:55.291
I should have stayed in my room, but...

38:56.334 --> 38:57.209
he was crying,

38:57.293 --> 39:00.588
so I just wanted to make everything okay
and make him feel better.

39:07.136 --> 39:10.556
He picked me up, hugged me...

39:13.225 --> 39:15.186
told me he loved me more than anything.

39:17.063 --> 39:22.818
And he said... if he can't have me,
then neither could she.

39:34.663 --> 39:36.374
And he jumped out the window.

39:39.335 --> 39:40.795
He died. I lived.

39:44.382 --> 39:45.591
He needed help.

39:46.926 --> 39:50.888
He needed someone to save him,
but there was no one there.

39:53.849 --> 39:56.227
And now, I have my scars
and I have my memories.

40:00.022 --> 40:02.817
Rebecca was like a daughter to me.

40:04.777 --> 40:06.320
And you are like a son.

40:08.531 --> 40:11.826
The pain you feel, I feel.

40:13.619 --> 40:15.121
She was my wife.

40:18.374 --> 40:20.501
I should have been there, not here.

40:21.210 --> 40:23.045
I know the promise you made Rebecca.

40:23.129 --> 40:27.258
She knew you would've been with her
if not for your work here.

40:28.717 --> 40:34.265
She wanted the last thing
that she saw in this world to be me.

40:34.348 --> 40:35.891
You mustn't blame yourself.

40:36.517 --> 40:41.981
These people who are trying to harm us,
they are why you weren't with Rebecca.

40:42.523 --> 40:46.777
This man, this Castle, he is the reason.

40:46.861 --> 40:48.028
Yeah?

40:51.740 --> 40:53.617
He never did anything to me.

40:56.036 --> 40:59.748
Your fight is for more than yourself.

41:00.458 --> 41:04.962
It's for a way of life,
a future for you and your boys.

41:06.297 --> 41:08.090
My boys need me home.

41:08.716 --> 41:10.509
But they need you certain, John.

41:11.010 --> 41:15.181
Not home full of regrets and fears
or resentments.

41:15.681 --> 41:19.143
Anderson and I will protect them,
just as we protect our own son, David,

41:19.226 --> 41:21.687
no matter what comes next.

41:22.521 --> 41:25.441
But the hopes of all of us...

41:26.025 --> 41:30.738
Rebecca, Michael, Lemuel,
they still depend on you!

41:31.322 --> 41:32.865
Your work here...

41:33.449 --> 41:35.659
it must be finished!

41:36.202 --> 41:37.411
You understand that?

41:40.789 --> 41:44.502
Yeah, I understand. I understand.

41:46.462 --> 41:50.716
God is testing you, John,
like he tested Abraham.

41:53.177 --> 41:55.596
He's using my boys to test my loyalty.

41:56.639 --> 41:58.057
That's God doing that?

41:59.808 --> 42:01.519
Call it a final test

42:01.602 --> 42:02.895
-of your faith.

42:04.605 --> 42:08.108
Abraham proved he was capable
of great sacrifice,

42:08.192 --> 42:12.863
and for that,
his family prospered long after him.

42:17.618 --> 42:19.328
I'm sure yours will, too.

42:44.979 --> 42:47.314
Whoa. You're early.

42:48.524 --> 42:51.902
I happened to catch the express.
Record time.

42:51.986 --> 42:52.861
All right.

42:53.445 --> 42:54.488
How's he been?

42:55.239 --> 42:59.034
Quiet as a mouse.
Half dead by the sound of it.

43:00.536 --> 43:01.954
-Good to know.
-Yeah.

43:03.080 --> 43:04.331
All right. Have a good one.

43:21.515 --> 43:22.683
Hey, Castle.

43:27.146 --> 43:28.439
Smile.

43:30.107 --> 43:30.941
No?

43:31.525 --> 43:33.360
-All right.

43:35.112 --> 43:38.907
A little before and after, you know?
Something for the scrapbook.

43:39.658 --> 43:44.538
Five million bucks.
That's a lot of overtime, Frank.

43:45.748 --> 43:48.876
It'd save the system
the trouble of putting you on trial.

43:49.501 --> 43:52.755
Not to mention the fact
that you killed my cousin.

43:53.922 --> 43:58.427
You cut one Irishman, and we all bleed.
Know what I'm saying?

43:59.261 --> 44:00.262
Any last words?

44:04.725 --> 44:05.684
Shit.

44:05.768 --> 44:06.852
No! Hey!

44:06.935 --> 44:09.688
-No! No! No! Hey! Hey! Hey!

44:10.189 --> 44:11.398
Hey!

44:12.858 --> 44:15.486
Hey, you touch her, I'll kill you!
You hear me?

44:15.569 --> 44:16.779
-Little bitch.
-Piece of shit!

44:16.862 --> 44:19.490
-Hey! Hey!

44:20.866 --> 44:23.077
-Hey! Hey, God damn it! She's just a kid!

44:23.160 --> 44:25.871
Look at me! Look at me!
I'm right here! Kill me!

44:25.954 --> 44:29.583
Hey! Let her go!
God damn it! You let her go!

44:29.667 --> 44:31.585
-Jesus Christ!
-You okay?

44:34.254 --> 44:35.506
-Jesus Christ.
-You okay?

44:35.589 --> 44:37.383
-God damn you!

44:37.466 --> 44:39.385
I told you to stay away! I told you!

44:41.929 --> 44:43.681
You mother scratcher!

44:48.769 --> 44:49.770
What was that, huh?

44:49.853 --> 44:52.648
You were just gonna let him do it

44:52.731 --> 44:55.192
Frank, you didn't do it.
You didn't kill those women.

44:55.275 --> 44:56.360
What are you talking about?

44:56.443 --> 44:57.986
They were dead
before you arrived.

44:58.070 --> 45:00.614
-Billy set you up.
-You're not the monster. You never were.

45:00.698 --> 45:03.992
This is all great, but it helps
absolutely nothing right now, okay?

45:04.535 --> 45:06.203
That was a cop
that just tried to kill him.

45:06.286 --> 45:08.497
And then me. I mean, what's next, a nurse?

45:08.580 --> 45:10.582
Why don't you get those keys
and get these cuffs off?

45:10.666 --> 45:12.042
I'm gonna go take care of him.

45:12.126 --> 45:13.752
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

45:13.836 --> 45:15.921
-Get the keys. I'll take care of it.
-You need a plan.

45:16.004 --> 45:17.798
You have to listen to us, okay?

45:20.259 --> 45:22.761
I need the two of you to walk out, okay?

45:22.845 --> 45:24.596
Please, just give us a second alone.

45:25.556 --> 45:27.641
Madani, please, just one second.

45:30.978 --> 45:32.396
Can I ask you something?

45:34.356 --> 45:38.152
That Matt Murdock,
does he know you're here?

45:44.825 --> 45:47.661
-Yeah, that's what I thought.
-What does that have to do with this?

45:47.745 --> 45:49.455
Come on, Karen. He's good.

45:50.038 --> 45:51.707
Don't throw that away for me.

45:58.547 --> 45:59.548
Hey.

46:00.674 --> 46:02.509
You gotta walk away now, Karen.

46:06.138 --> 46:10.517
Come on, Karen. Look, I know you.
All right? You're brave. You're strong.

46:10.601 --> 46:13.520
But you are so goddamn stubborn,
and you will throw everything away for me,

46:13.604 --> 46:14.855
and I cannot let that happen.

46:14.938 --> 46:17.316
So, it's okay for them to risk everything,
but not me?

46:17.399 --> 46:19.193
Karen, don't do that. Look, they...

46:19.693 --> 46:22.362
That kid needs me
to stay alive, all right?

46:22.446 --> 46:25.783
Eff Madani. Madani, she's as batshit
and lost as I am.

46:25.866 --> 46:27.576
I mean, she's lost, Karen.
It's not the same.

46:27.659 --> 46:29.119
What if there's a better way?

46:30.078 --> 46:32.331
What if there is

46:32.414 --> 46:34.500
No. No, there's no...

46:34.583 --> 46:37.294
-There's no warm, cozy ending. Not for me.
-Frank, listen to me.

46:37.377 --> 46:39.463
You can't keep loving people
in your dreams.

46:43.509 --> 46:45.719
There's no light at the end of the road.
There's no light.

46:45.803 --> 46:47.137
-There could be if you let it.
-No.

46:47.221 --> 46:49.389
-You could choose to love...
-I don't want that. I can't.

46:49.473 --> 46:51.183
-...someone else instead of another war.
-No.

46:53.727 --> 46:54.770
I don't want to.

46:56.939 --> 46:58.315
You know something? That...

46:59.650 --> 47:02.152
That kid out there, she got people
that want to kill her.

47:02.820 --> 47:04.279
Serious people, Karen.

47:06.031 --> 47:08.575
So that means I'm gonna go and find them
and I'm gonna kill them.

47:08.659 --> 47:10.118
-I'm gonna murder them, Karen.
-Yeah.

47:10.202 --> 47:12.538
I'm gonna do that to keep her alive,
because that's my life.

47:12.621 --> 47:14.540
That's what I do.
You wanna be a part of that?

47:15.999 --> 47:19.002
Hang on. Just... God.

47:27.219 --> 47:30.389
Karen, I can't tell you how much
it means to me that you came here.

47:31.640 --> 47:32.641
You sat with me.

47:33.225 --> 47:34.643
So make it mean something.

47:53.412 --> 47:56.164
I gotta walk out of here,
and you can't do it with me.

47:59.960 --> 48:00.878
Just...

48:07.634 --> 48:13.140
You guys are the cutest.
I'm almost jealous.

48:14.016 --> 48:18.353
But, uh, do you mind if we continue
this heart-to-heart once we're outta here?

48:59.811 --> 49:00.854
What the hell is going on?

49:19.247 --> 49:21.249
Tell me you've still got eyes on Castle.

49:21.333 --> 49:23.377
As soon as you can,
you need to get him back. Okay?

49:23.460 --> 49:24.962
-Yeah.
-All right?

49:25.045 --> 49:27.547
-They just wheeled him out.
-Wherever they take him,

49:27.631 --> 49:29.925
-you follow. Hear me?
-Loud and clear. Loud and clear.

50:06.420 --> 50:07.629
I can't believe this.

50:09.756 --> 50:11.008
How did this happen?

50:14.052 --> 50:16.847
I don't know.

50:19.391 --> 50:21.268
All units. All units.

50:21.810 --> 50:24.563
Frank Castle has escaped.
All exits, I want 'em covered.

50:24.646 --> 50:27.607
-Just keep it cool.
-Elevators, rooftops, stairwells.

50:27.691 --> 50:30.777
No one leaves this hospital.
You understand? No one.

50:51.798 --> 50:52.799
Karen?

50:56.094 --> 50:57.471
What happened to your shoes?

51:00.098 --> 51:01.808
I gave 'em away for a worthy cause.

51:12.611 --> 51:13.820
Good luck, Frank.

51:22.120 --> 51:23.205
Freeze!

51:23.288 --> 51:24.664
-Freeze, God damn it!
-Shit!

51:25.665 --> 51:28.376
Now, drop your weapon. Drop it!

51:29.836 --> 51:31.379
Drop the belt, Frank. You, too.

51:32.464 --> 51:34.466
Drop it!
Don't test me, you son of a bitch.

51:35.008 --> 51:36.927
I shoot you now,
nobody's gonna bat an eye.

51:37.469 --> 51:38.678
Drop it, Madani.

51:43.725 --> 51:46.186
Don't try no shit.
And put one on your wrist.

51:48.063 --> 51:49.147
Mahoney, just listen.

51:49.731 --> 51:53.235
I've been listening to you way too much.
Put one on your wrist.

51:56.696 --> 51:58.615
-Get in the ambulance.
-Need to calm down.

51:58.698 --> 52:01.660
Step up. Step up now, God damn it.

52:02.828 --> 52:04.454
I'm gonna fry your ass for this.

52:11.211 --> 52:13.296
You're not the only one
who gets to be crazy.

52:18.593 --> 52:20.303
-No.
