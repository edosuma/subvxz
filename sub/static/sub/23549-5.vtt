WEBVTT

00:07.320 --> 00:09.320
[breathing heavily]

00:12.360 --> 00:13.480
[grunts]

00:21.680 --> 00:22.880
[sighs]

00:27.200 --> 00:28.400
[grumbles]

00:32.119 --> 00:33.120
[grunts]

00:34.840 --> 00:36.000
Shaman.

00:37.240 --> 00:39.480
'Tis I, Raxion, master of the Guard.

00:39.560 --> 00:41.640
I know who it is.

00:41.720 --> 00:43.800
What do you want, Raxion?

00:45.360 --> 00:46.440
[Raxion chuckles]

00:48.880 --> 00:51.880
There have been sightings
verified by our trackers.

00:52.480 --> 00:54.920
We have some gods in the area. Mmm.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.520
I felt them.

00:56.600 --> 00:58.640
Oh, of course you did. Mmm.

00:58.720 --> 00:59.720
[sniffles]

01:03.960 --> 01:05.400
And are you ready?

01:06.680 --> 01:08.000
Always.

01:10.160 --> 01:11.280
[sighs]

01:17.600 --> 01:18.680
Really?

01:20.320 --> 01:21.320
[spits]

01:32.480 --> 01:33.560
[Tripitaka] What would happen

01:33.640 --> 01:36.320
if the demons got ahold of the knowledge
in the sacred scrolls?

01:37.400 --> 01:39.560
[Monkey] The scrolls are written
in the ancient language.

01:40.320 --> 01:43.720
Demons can't decode it, only gods.

01:44.840 --> 01:48.680
The scholar knew how to read it.
He taught me when I was young.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.080
Good for you, monk.

01:53.520 --> 01:56.080
[sighs] And you still are young.

02:00.400 --> 02:01.720
[owl hooting]

02:02.360 --> 02:03.320
[Pigsy grunts]

02:03.400 --> 02:05.160
[slurps] Oh!

02:06.080 --> 02:10.000
I'm so hungry I could kill you all
just to have this to myself. [chuckles]

02:11.039 --> 02:12.600
Oh, I miss good food.

02:14.040 --> 02:15.560
What have you done to those potatoes?

02:16.400 --> 02:19.480
-Your knife skills are tragic.
-Real gods don't cook.

02:19.560 --> 02:21.800
-Real gods brush their hair.
-Do they?

02:22.640 --> 02:23.640
It's humor.

02:25.200 --> 02:27.760
So your hair's unkempt,
which is the opposite of having--

02:27.840 --> 02:29.480
Do real gods brush their hair or not?

02:31.960 --> 02:33.960
[music playing]

02:38.200 --> 02:40.080
[Sandy] Why do I hear music?

02:40.160 --> 02:41.600
It's coming from over there.

02:44.040 --> 02:46.080
-[Pigsy] Sandy!
-Hurry up!

02:48.440 --> 02:50.160
[music continues playing]

02:50.840 --> 02:51.840
What is that?

02:57.880 --> 03:01.360
No, no, no, no. Stay here.
You're not so good in conflict situations.

03:04.200 --> 03:05.280
What's happening?

03:19.320 --> 03:20.360
Monkey?

03:23.760 --> 03:27.000
[Raxion] Ah, there's the third one.

03:29.040 --> 03:31.560
Oh, the big boss will be over the moon!

03:32.880 --> 03:35.320
Let's speed it up.
It's too cold to fart around.

03:37.640 --> 03:40.920
Whoa, these gods are a good catch.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.960
Right, load 'em up so we can get back
and put 'em to work.

03:54.080 --> 03:55.600
[blows kisses]

04:09.640 --> 04:13.200
[shaman] We are going to help each other.

04:17.480 --> 04:18.560
You...

04:19.560 --> 04:23.480
You can read the language
of the sacred scrolls.

04:28.600 --> 04:34.760
You will translate them for us,
here in the breaking ground.

04:36.720 --> 04:38.560
Three at once. [clicks tongue]

04:39.120 --> 04:41.680
We may be in the running
for a bonus this month, shaman.

04:44.440 --> 04:45.920
Let's crank 'em up, hey?

04:47.080 --> 04:50.080
The mind of a god
is a magnificent creation.

04:50.600 --> 04:52.120
The only way
to get them to do what we want

04:52.200 --> 04:55.160
is to make them think
it is all their own idea.

04:58.960 --> 05:00.920
They all know the same tavern.

05:01.480 --> 05:04.520
They all know the tavern owner, Monica.

05:04.600 --> 05:06.720
So they can all play together, then.

05:08.240 --> 05:12.360
Everyone's happy. Everyone's settled in.

05:13.040 --> 05:15.120
Everyone's ready to play.

05:22.240 --> 05:23.960
[Monica] Welcome, everyone!

05:24.040 --> 05:26.520
Don't you all look smart and lovely.

05:26.600 --> 05:29.440
Monica's night of fun is about to begin.

05:29.520 --> 05:31.600
First up, who's hungry?

05:33.080 --> 05:34.440
New guests.

05:36.760 --> 05:42.040
Eat up and settle in
for the funnest night of your lives.

05:42.120 --> 05:46.600
Um, excuse me, I can't actually pay.
I don't have any gold.

05:49.120 --> 05:50.800
Not needed tonight.

05:50.880 --> 05:53.800
It's all included.
All you can eat, and it's all free.

05:54.600 --> 05:55.520
Didn't you know that?

05:57.320 --> 06:02.720
All you have to do is have fun
and eat and drink and play some games.

06:03.440 --> 06:04.560
Do you like games?

06:05.920 --> 06:07.760
-I do.
-Me, too.

06:07.840 --> 06:11.200
Super-duper.
As long as you play, you can eat.

06:11.280 --> 06:14.600
If you want more, just yell out for it.

06:14.680 --> 06:16.560
[utensils clanging]

06:31.880 --> 06:33.920
You have to be here somewhere.

06:37.560 --> 06:38.720
Monkey!

06:39.880 --> 06:41.080
Sandy!

06:41.960 --> 06:44.320
Pigsy! [gasps]

06:55.600 --> 06:57.200
First round!

06:57.280 --> 07:00.760
-Up for grabs, two bags of gold...
-[crowd exclaims]

07:00.840 --> 07:02.920
...and a wagon full of town goodies.

07:03.920 --> 07:04.920
Are we ready?

07:05.000 --> 07:06.520
[crowd laughing]

07:07.480 --> 07:09.920
[Monica] Are our eyes wide open?

07:10.640 --> 07:11.800
Yes!

07:12.400 --> 07:15.160
Are our minds ready?

07:16.200 --> 07:17.720
-Yes!
-Yes.

07:19.720 --> 07:20.720
Wait.

07:21.400 --> 07:23.680
Wait, what do we do?
I don't know this game.

07:23.760 --> 07:26.480
What are the rules? Explain the rules!

07:29.160 --> 07:32.960
It's a memory game, so just write down
the things you can remember.

07:34.560 --> 07:35.600
But I don't have a pen.

07:38.360 --> 07:39.480
Got it.

07:40.960 --> 07:43.360
-Got it?
-Oh, I've got it.

07:43.440 --> 07:46.080
I've got a great memory.
We're gonna own this.

07:48.240 --> 07:51.880
You have 30 seconds. Make them count.

07:51.960 --> 07:54.560
-Let's have some focus.
-[shaman] Focus...

07:55.360 --> 07:56.680
[crowd laughing]

07:56.760 --> 07:57.680
Go!

07:58.440 --> 07:59.440
[Monica] Translate.

07:59.520 --> 08:04.160
Translate from god language to ours
whatever you remember.

08:06.400 --> 08:09.080
-What are you doing? Hurry up.
-I'm thinking.

08:26.560 --> 08:29.040
Oh, why are they always so slow?

08:29.120 --> 08:31.440
We'll be at it for centuries!

08:32.880 --> 08:33.880
Have a look at this one.

08:35.520 --> 08:37.600
Come on, sunshine, get a move on.

08:38.400 --> 08:40.320
Our boss is expecting you.

08:42.240 --> 08:43.360
It's not working.

08:43.440 --> 08:44.800
[shaman] No.

08:44.880 --> 08:47.080
[Raxion] Hmm. What's wrong with him?

08:48.040 --> 08:51.560
These gods all know how to translate
the ancient language, don't they?

08:51.640 --> 08:55.320
-This one is strong. He hasn't moved.
-Hmm.

08:55.400 --> 08:58.000
-A reject, perhaps.
-Hardly.

09:00.200 --> 09:03.000
[shaman] I think he needs
to be pushed a little further.

09:03.880 --> 09:05.200
We have some others ready.

09:05.280 --> 09:07.760
These gods can be
broken down a little more...

09:09.040 --> 09:10.480
extremely.

09:10.560 --> 09:11.560
[Raxion] Mmm.

09:13.440 --> 09:15.560
Got a delivery to the Jade Mountain.

09:17.360 --> 09:20.000
There's some gods, broken, ready to go.

09:20.880 --> 09:23.680
You need to have a cart here by dusk.
You got that?

09:23.760 --> 09:25.760
[clears throat]
Or need me to write it down?

09:25.840 --> 09:27.440
[scoffs and chuckles]

09:32.800 --> 09:35.680
Bonus cards. What are you waiting for?

09:50.200 --> 09:53.640
There are prizes for speed and accuracy
tonight too, you know?

09:56.160 --> 09:58.520
Do I have to stand here and watch you?

10:00.560 --> 10:03.360
I don't care. It's stupid.

10:03.440 --> 10:04.920
Do you even know how to do this?

10:05.000 --> 10:07.240
[scoffs] Of course.

10:07.320 --> 10:11.720
Monkey, I'm sure you've got
beautiful handwriting.

10:12.720 --> 10:13.800
Hmm?

10:19.880 --> 10:23.960
Uh... it's this way.

10:31.960 --> 10:33.080
Where are you going, mister?

10:49.440 --> 10:50.640
Do I know you?

10:50.720 --> 10:52.400
I know a lot of gods.

10:53.040 --> 10:54.160
Hmm.

10:59.920 --> 11:01.960
-And you can read this?
-Mmm-hmm.

11:04.440 --> 11:07.080
-Who taught you?
-The Master.

11:08.960 --> 11:10.280
The Master?

11:14.560 --> 11:16.000
The Jade Mountain.

11:20.840 --> 11:24.120
You were there.
We trained together with the Master.

11:25.120 --> 11:26.200
Lior.

11:27.640 --> 11:31.720
Yes. I know you, Monkey,
but that time has gone.

11:33.880 --> 11:35.200
Come. Play.

11:38.280 --> 11:41.280
You have to play. Trust me on this.

11:41.960 --> 11:43.040
Why?

11:44.200 --> 11:48.360
Well, that's why we're here.
It's what we do.

11:49.080 --> 11:51.160
We translate the sacred scrolls.

11:57.880 --> 11:59.400
[shaman] He's still blocking.

12:00.360 --> 12:01.520
Astounding.

12:02.520 --> 12:04.040
His mind is strong.

12:04.120 --> 12:06.800
We need results,
or we need to dispose of him.

12:06.880 --> 12:08.640
That's the directive
from our trusted leader.

12:08.720 --> 12:11.280
If these gods don't earn their place,
then they're out.

12:11.360 --> 12:14.200
Don't tell me how to do my job, Raxion.

12:14.280 --> 12:16.440
It's not you who will suffer
if this stuffs up.

12:19.160 --> 12:20.240
[sighs]

12:21.240 --> 12:22.520
What is that?

12:23.480 --> 12:25.800
-Game changer.
-Yeah!

12:28.920 --> 12:31.560
Pushes the god to go deeper
into their own mind.

12:31.640 --> 12:32.600
[groans]

12:34.120 --> 12:35.480
He will play.

12:38.120 --> 12:39.920
They always play.

12:44.720 --> 12:45.720
[grunts]

12:52.600 --> 12:53.640
[grunting]

13:07.040 --> 13:09.800
Watch him. Learn from him.

13:12.200 --> 13:13.720
Go, go, go!

13:17.640 --> 13:20.720
[whispering] I need to get back there.
To the Jade Mountain.

13:21.440 --> 13:24.040
I'm sorry for what happened to you,
Monkey.

13:24.120 --> 13:25.600
We all are.

13:25.680 --> 13:26.880
How long have you been here?

13:28.120 --> 13:30.560
Excuse me,
don't mean to break up the party,

13:30.640 --> 13:34.080
but you can't win unless you play.

13:35.600 --> 13:38.400
Now, I know you know the answer.

13:39.320 --> 13:42.640
Pick up your pen and write it down.

13:43.560 --> 13:44.600
Neatly.

13:52.160 --> 13:55.760
I'm waiting, and I will wait all day.

13:55.840 --> 13:57.000
I'll show him.

13:57.760 --> 13:58.760
I'll show him.

14:04.240 --> 14:06.680
Just do it. The Master taught us all.

14:06.760 --> 14:08.320
Listen to your friend.

14:08.400 --> 14:10.720
If we don't play the game, we will lose.

14:11.480 --> 14:12.520
I don't want to lose.

14:13.880 --> 14:14.880
[Monkey] Lior,

14:16.360 --> 14:17.600
what is this place?

14:17.680 --> 14:22.240
I don't know. But this is how you survive.

14:53.960 --> 14:55.640
The ancient language.

15:34.280 --> 15:35.280
[Sandy] I...

15:36.720 --> 15:37.720
[grunts]

15:37.800 --> 15:39.080
What's wrong with you?

15:39.160 --> 15:41.480
My hand's... stuck.

15:41.560 --> 15:43.080
[Tripitaka] Monkey! Please!

15:43.160 --> 15:44.400
[Monica] Three!

15:46.000 --> 15:48.640
[Tripitaka] Sandy! Pigsy! Wake up!

15:50.760 --> 15:51.600
Monkey.

15:52.640 --> 15:53.840
[Monica] Two!

15:53.920 --> 15:55.520
Monkey, please.

15:56.360 --> 15:57.280
Did you hear that?

15:57.840 --> 15:58.840
[Monica] One!

15:58.920 --> 16:00.160
Go! Go! Go!

16:07.880 --> 16:12.320
[shaman] You are one of the most
consistent gods I've ever seen, Lior.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.840
Clever, but a follower.

16:14.920 --> 16:16.920
A natural fact-checker.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.800
You will do well at the Jade Mountain.

16:22.000 --> 16:22.960
[Raxion] Load 'em up.

16:23.040 --> 16:24.040
[sighs]

16:26.560 --> 16:28.440
I'll be gone for two days.

16:30.040 --> 16:32.400
Will I tell 'em we've got
some good ones in there?

16:32.480 --> 16:35.680
The new three are viable
as they are powerful.

16:35.760 --> 16:37.000
[Raxion] Mmm-hmm.

16:37.080 --> 16:38.440
I must return.

16:39.120 --> 16:42.400
The fantasy needs
to be maintained impeccably.

16:42.480 --> 16:43.440
Mmm-hmm.

16:44.760 --> 16:46.480
Where has your friend gone?

16:52.640 --> 16:56.240
Fun, fun, fourth round.

16:57.000 --> 16:59.520
Fun, fun, fourth round!

17:01.240 --> 17:02.280
[clears throat]

17:02.360 --> 17:04.640
Where is Lior? He was just here.

17:04.720 --> 17:07.079
He went home. He was tired.

17:07.960 --> 17:10.440
Boring old Lior needed a little nap.

17:12.240 --> 17:15.880
I need you to step up in this round.
Do you think you can?

17:15.960 --> 17:17.160
[Pigsy] Don't be shy.

17:17.240 --> 17:20.280
Mate, I used to be shy,
and look at me now.

17:20.359 --> 17:22.440
-Learn to be like me. Okay?
-Don't you want to stay here?

17:22.520 --> 17:24.280
-Yes!
-It's not hard. I'm sure...

17:24.359 --> 17:26.040
-Just pick up a pen! Start making...
-...if you just picked up...

17:26.119 --> 17:27.240
-...the stripes on the page.
-[Sandy] Take this one.

17:27.319 --> 17:29.040
-[Pigsy] Look, how many facts?
-If you put it on your parchment...

17:29.120 --> 17:30.640
-One? Two?
-...I'm sure it will come back.

17:30.720 --> 17:31.600
I can't!

17:35.000 --> 17:36.320
[sighs]

17:37.760 --> 17:40.680
I don't know how to read
the gods' language.

17:40.760 --> 17:42.080
I never learned.

17:43.080 --> 17:44.640
I thought it was stupid.

18:12.720 --> 18:15.200
No one has come or gone through that door
since we've been here.

18:18.520 --> 18:19.840
There's something out there...

18:20.920 --> 18:22.400
and I need to see it.

18:36.280 --> 18:37.840
What have they done to you?

18:50.520 --> 18:51.640
Where's Pigsy?

18:59.520 --> 19:01.000
[straining]

19:01.720 --> 19:02.760
[voice distorting] Where are you going?

19:05.640 --> 19:07.760
You need to win!

19:08.640 --> 19:09.760
Monkey.

19:11.560 --> 19:12.600
I'm leaving.

19:12.680 --> 19:16.000
I'm innocent.
I need to go back and find him.

19:17.640 --> 19:18.880
I need to know the truth.

19:18.960 --> 19:20.320
Find who?

19:20.400 --> 19:21.320
[Tripitaka] Sandy!

19:22.480 --> 19:23.640
Wake up!

19:29.720 --> 19:30.800
[gasps]

19:31.520 --> 19:32.640
Not good.

19:51.720 --> 19:53.160
[Raxion] Hmm.

19:55.320 --> 19:56.520
[font goon] A message from the shaman.

20:00.240 --> 20:01.960
The breaking ground's been breached.

20:04.760 --> 20:06.720
Well, what are you doing?
Stay here and protect this lot.

20:06.800 --> 20:08.160
I'll take care of it.

20:09.560 --> 20:11.640
Monkey? Monkey, wake up.

20:11.720 --> 20:13.440
[Pigsy] Where are we?

20:13.520 --> 20:14.600
You were captured by demons.

20:14.680 --> 20:17.160
[groans] It's a prison.

20:17.240 --> 20:20.720
Where's Monica? Where's the tavern?

20:20.800 --> 20:22.640
You were being forced to translate.

20:22.720 --> 20:24.200
[Pigsy] It was all in our minds.

20:24.280 --> 20:27.960
We were playing a game.
Except Monkey. He wanted to leave.

20:28.040 --> 20:32.040
He wanted to go back
to find out the truth.

20:32.800 --> 20:34.000
Back where?

20:35.480 --> 20:37.200
You must play.

20:37.280 --> 20:39.600
You have to play. You have to be broken...

20:39.680 --> 20:45.000
[voice distorting] Come and sit down!
Come and eat! You must have fun!

20:45.080 --> 20:48.360
Come back. Please, come back.

20:48.440 --> 20:49.720
[gasps]

20:49.800 --> 20:51.160
[grunts]

20:52.040 --> 20:53.440
[shaman] Don't go out there.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.800
[Monkey] I don't take orders from a demon.

21:08.520 --> 21:11.240
You can go too deep into your own mind.

21:12.040 --> 21:15.320
There is a point of no return.

21:15.400 --> 21:16.880
Come back with me.

21:17.560 --> 21:20.640
There is much that can be offered to you
if you will help us.

21:20.720 --> 21:22.800
I don't think so. [scoffs]

21:22.880 --> 21:25.600
[Tripitaka] Come back, please!
We need you.

21:26.600 --> 21:28.720
The little monk knows the truth.

21:29.840 --> 21:31.680
I was trapped for 500 years.

21:32.720 --> 21:35.480
I will never be trapped again.

21:35.560 --> 21:38.840
[Tripitaka] Monkey King,
we have to go. Now!

21:40.760 --> 21:42.400
You are the Monkey King?

21:44.040 --> 21:46.920
The one and only.

22:07.360 --> 22:08.960
-[Pigsy] Monkey!
-[Sandy] Is he...

22:13.280 --> 22:14.560
Lock this down, shaman.

22:15.200 --> 22:16.040
He's breathing.

22:16.720 --> 22:17.720
It's too late.

22:18.600 --> 22:20.280
[Tripitaka] What did you do to him?

22:21.960 --> 22:24.040
He did it to himself.

22:25.040 --> 22:27.160
-He would not listen.
-Where is he?

22:32.440 --> 22:34.480
He's going into his past.

22:57.280 --> 22:59.280
[Tripitaka] I can get him back.

22:59.360 --> 23:02.160
I broke him out of a rock
that held him for 500 years.

23:02.840 --> 23:04.440
I'll find a way.

23:04.520 --> 23:06.200
I will get him back.

23:07.640 --> 23:09.480
[theme music playing]
