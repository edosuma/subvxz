00:01.282 --> 00:02.782
Previously on "The Originals"...

00:02.812 --> 00:04.434
Till death do us part.

00:04.464 --> 00:07.136
She admitted it herself.
Davina Claire is a murderer.

00:07.166 --> 00:09.583
Kill a witch, you lose your
place among the witches.

00:09.585 --> 00:12.252
For what you've done,
you need to be shunned.

00:12.893 --> 00:14.164
Oh...

00:17.509 --> 00:19.176
I hope you don't mind.

00:19.378 --> 00:22.578
I helped myself to the
Mikaelson family blood stash.

00:22.915 --> 00:25.498
- How do you feel?
- Amazing.

00:25.885 --> 00:28.868
The Serratura creates
an impenetrable boundary.

00:29.146 --> 00:32.088
Nothing living or dead can pass through.

00:32.090 --> 00:34.702
May the ghosts of our
fallen keep you company.

00:34.732 --> 00:37.457
Aya. Aya!

00:40.093 --> 00:43.800
Tristan de Martel guided this
organization for centuries.

00:44.290 --> 00:47.760
He was a radical thinker,
a decisive leader,

00:47.790 --> 00:51.374
and to each of us here
tonight, both mentor and friend.

00:51.376 --> 00:55.745
He was, in a word, irreplaceable.

00:56.719 --> 00:58.744
To Tristan de Martel.

01:02.206 --> 01:04.793
Though we grieve his loss,
I will not allow that defeat

01:04.822 --> 01:06.478
to hamper our cause.

01:06.508 --> 01:09.176
We will stand united in
the face of this tragedy

01:09.178 --> 01:10.892
of singular mind

01:12.397 --> 01:14.931
and of singular heart.

01:15.383 --> 01:17.339
To that end, I've asked our witch Ariane

01:17.369 --> 01:19.776
to conduct an assessment.

01:21.000 --> 01:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:29.832 --> 01:32.154
Tell me, Ariane, when you looked

01:32.184 --> 01:36.403
into their hearts, what did you see?

01:36.405 --> 01:40.190
Was it loyalty or something else?

01:40.192 --> 01:42.325
Before each of you lies a card,

01:42.327 --> 01:44.828
a divination of your truest self.

01:44.830 --> 01:46.579
If your intentions are pure,

01:46.581 --> 01:49.032
you should not fear what it shows.

01:58.210 --> 02:00.010
A loyal knight.

02:15.777 --> 02:17.610
I owe no allegiance to you.

02:17.612 --> 02:18.862
Uh!

02:22.684 --> 02:24.844
I will not tolerate anyone conspiring

02:24.874 --> 02:26.974
to use our present circumstances

02:27.481 --> 02:30.301
as an opportunity for a power grab.

02:31.493 --> 02:34.544
And you, Marcel Gerard,

02:34.997 --> 02:38.465
do you seek to betray
me for power, as well?

02:38.467 --> 02:42.168
I'm hurt that you even have to ask.

03:00.281 --> 03:03.356
These are uncertain times.

03:03.358 --> 03:06.181
We need to be certain of each other.

03:06.211 --> 03:07.678
Despite what Elijah Mikaelson

03:07.708 --> 03:10.168
may have us believe, the prophecy

03:10.198 --> 03:13.138
of his demise is all too real,

03:14.054 --> 03:16.002
and a threat to our sire

03:16.004 --> 03:18.338
is a threat against us.

03:18.583 --> 03:20.757
I, for one, am committed

03:20.759 --> 03:23.676
to ensuring our continued survival...

03:27.966 --> 03:31.101
By whatever means necessary.

03:36.759 --> 03:39.726
Hi. Do you have any angelica flower?

03:42.842 --> 03:44.036
Ok. I know I've been shunned,

03:44.066 --> 03:47.434
but you can at least look at me.

03:52.644 --> 03:56.409
Hello. I'm in the market for some angelica.

03:58.238 --> 04:00.080
Perhaps you've heard of it. No?

04:00.082 --> 04:01.531
Ok. Follow-up question...
Do you happen to have

04:01.533 --> 04:03.450
any kind of comment box
or complaint hotline?

04:03.452 --> 04:05.252
Because I got a few thoughts
on your customer service

04:05.254 --> 04:07.504
that, trust me, you do
not want to end up on yelp.

04:07.506 --> 04:09.706
Josh, let's just go.

04:09.708 --> 04:12.292
Ok. Fine, but you know
what? I'm taking these.

04:24.973 --> 04:26.640
Where the bloody hell is she?

04:27.287 --> 04:29.726
I assume we are talking about Camille.

04:29.947 --> 04:31.811
Just refresh my memory, Niklaus.

04:32.341 --> 04:33.652
Was I the one who impulsively

04:33.682 --> 04:35.014
handed her a daylight ring?

04:36.312 --> 04:37.317
Oh, no. That's right. It was you.

04:37.319 --> 04:38.498
She left, didn't she?

04:38.528 --> 04:40.854
Shocking turn of events.

04:41.694 --> 04:43.857
Yes, so why don't you go and find her?

04:43.859 --> 04:45.742
I shall deal with the growing nightmare

04:45.744 --> 04:47.616
of our family's potential extinction.

04:47.646 --> 04:49.612
Yes, always the diligent defender,

04:49.614 --> 04:51.731
despite the fact the threat
has somewhat subsided,

04:51.733 --> 04:53.799
what with Tristan de Martel now

04:53.829 --> 04:55.235
literally sleeping with the fishes.

04:55.237 --> 04:57.454
A darker threat remains.

04:57.456 --> 04:58.412
Now something out there

04:58.442 --> 04:59.711
is capable of killing us.

04:59.741 --> 05:01.246
We should probably find it.

05:01.276 --> 05:02.297
I'd love to.

05:02.327 --> 05:04.683
However, I got Camille into this mess.

05:04.918 --> 05:07.164
She left around sunrise.

05:08.587 --> 05:10.750
My guess is that she needed some air.

05:10.752 --> 05:12.219
I couldn't sleep.

05:12.221 --> 05:14.129
I saw her leave from my balcony.

05:14.797 --> 05:18.130
So, um, I was wondering,

05:18.160 --> 05:20.432
if maybe it was ok if Hope and I

05:20.462 --> 05:22.712
stay here for a few days.

05:22.714 --> 05:25.298
Of course you may.

05:29.866 --> 05:31.387
Forgive me.

05:34.658 --> 05:37.466
Hayley, this family comes
with many, many hardships,

05:37.496 --> 05:40.413
but there is at least one benefit.

05:41.109 --> 05:43.917
You will always have a home here.

05:49.420 --> 05:51.329
I sincerely hope you're
calling from somewhere

05:51.359 --> 05:53.526
far, far away.

05:53.528 --> 05:55.194
I think we both know I won't leave

05:55.196 --> 05:57.396
until this prophecy is averted.

05:57.398 --> 05:59.532
Somewhere out there is an elusive weapon

05:59.534 --> 06:01.270
capable of killing an Original.

06:01.804 --> 06:03.786
I'm calling to suggest we pool our efforts

06:03.788 --> 06:04.904
to find it.

06:05.256 --> 06:07.479
I don't play well with others.

06:08.290 --> 06:10.232
Lucien's witch Alexis left her clues

06:10.262 --> 06:12.679
in a rather cryptic puzzle.

06:13.316 --> 06:15.014
What if I told you I had the means

06:15.016 --> 06:16.806
to put it together?

06:21.976 --> 06:23.879
Davina, I called, like, a billion times.

06:23.909 --> 06:25.447
It's kind of enough to make a guy feel...

06:25.477 --> 06:28.061
I don't know... shunned or something.

06:28.356 --> 06:29.562
Sorry. Too soon?

06:29.564 --> 06:31.236
Josh, I'm sorry I haven't called you back.

06:31.266 --> 06:32.515
It's just things have been really...

06:32.517 --> 06:35.018
Really, yeah, awful. No kidding.

06:35.020 --> 06:36.603
The thing is, this is
kind of the whole reason

06:36.605 --> 06:38.321
you have friends, so you don't have to do

06:38.323 --> 06:40.395
the terrible parts alone.

06:42.515 --> 06:44.916
Whoa. Hey, should I be worried

06:44.946 --> 06:47.730
or, like, really excited right now?

06:50.714 --> 06:51.914
Hello, Joshua.

06:52.673 --> 06:54.721
Ms. Claire, I assume you know who I am.

06:54.723 --> 06:57.724
I suggest you get in.
We've much to discuss.

06:57.884 --> 07:00.148
I'll call you later, I promise.

07:23.906 --> 07:25.273
Cami?

07:25.303 --> 07:27.092
Damn, girl, you look amazing.

07:27.122 --> 07:30.673
You know, I feel amazing.

07:31.858 --> 07:33.426
Hey, 4 Tequila shots stat,

07:33.428 --> 07:36.154
and don't be afraid to move that sweet ass.

07:37.711 --> 07:39.382
Real nice.

07:39.384 --> 07:41.434
She works hard, you know.

07:41.464 --> 07:42.802
Oh, yeah?

07:42.804 --> 07:44.771
How about you, gorgeous?
You work hard, too?

07:44.773 --> 07:48.833
Sure. As a matter of fact, right now,

07:48.863 --> 07:51.227
it's hard work resisting the urge

07:51.229 --> 07:54.227
to rip your throat out with my teeth.

07:55.434 --> 07:57.867
Heh. You're gonna find an ATM,

07:57.869 --> 08:00.453
and you're going to
max out your daily limit

08:00.455 --> 08:02.955
and leave that nice, underpaid bartender

08:02.957 --> 08:05.430
the biggest tip she's ever seen.

08:05.460 --> 08:07.010
Then you're gonna meet me in the alley

08:07.012 --> 08:09.379
out back so we can have some real fun,

08:09.381 --> 08:11.214
and turn your hat around.

08:11.216 --> 08:13.383
You're an adult.

08:19.191 --> 08:20.723
These are for you from the guy

08:20.725 --> 08:22.275
at the end of the bar.

08:22.277 --> 08:24.978
He was pretty insistent.

08:31.502 --> 08:34.008
As you know from your own experience,

08:34.038 --> 08:36.405
any vampire who seeks true power

08:36.610 --> 08:38.447
will inevitably require the aid of a witch.

08:38.477 --> 08:40.582
We Strix are no exception.

08:41.351 --> 08:43.395
However, I have found that witches for hire

08:43.426 --> 08:46.890
can only be trusted so far, and so...

08:47.433 --> 08:48.921
meet the Sisters,

08:49.385 --> 08:51.609
wayward souls with an
extraordinary capacity

08:51.639 --> 08:53.422
for magic.

08:53.424 --> 08:54.392
Of course, when I found them, they were

08:54.422 --> 08:56.509
nothing but orphans and outcasts

08:56.539 --> 08:59.590
belonging nowhere and with no one

08:59.620 --> 09:02.849
until they found a home here with us.

09:03.321 --> 09:05.485
So the Strix have their own personal coven.

09:06.451 --> 09:08.293
Think of them as consultants

09:08.323 --> 09:10.239
held on retainer.

09:10.241 --> 09:12.497
If your 9 covens are a burning candle,

09:12.527 --> 09:15.695
what you see before you is a 5 alarm fire.

09:15.895 --> 09:18.103
In fact, they are the
only coven in the world

09:18.133 --> 09:21.217
capable of casting this...

09:29.511 --> 09:31.728
The spell to raise the dead.

09:33.835 --> 09:35.315
How did you know?

09:35.317 --> 09:38.234
About your dogged desire
to bring back Kol Mikaelson?

09:38.710 --> 09:40.269
That's what they're for.

09:40.271 --> 09:42.844
The Sisters search the
unknown and reveal to me

09:42.874 --> 09:45.756
anything that may be of use,

09:46.191 --> 09:48.556
for instance,

09:48.586 --> 09:51.697
the leverage I need to make you my ally.

09:51.799 --> 09:53.171
What do you want from me?

09:53.201 --> 09:55.039
I'll make certain you're granted the power

09:55.069 --> 09:56.791
to bring back your precious Kol.

09:56.821 --> 09:59.622
In exchange, you will take a vow of fealty

09:59.624 --> 10:01.708
and become one of my Sisters.

10:01.710 --> 10:03.728
It's all rather
straightforward, I assure you.

10:03.908 --> 10:06.296
Each of them faced a similar choice.

10:06.298 --> 10:07.580
That which you most wish for

10:07.582 --> 10:09.415
is within your grasp.

10:09.417 --> 10:10.794
The question is,

10:10.824 --> 10:15.338
are you willing to pay the price?

10:21.346 --> 10:22.729
Thank you for the drink.

10:22.731 --> 10:24.547
Well, you seemed rather thirsty.

10:24.577 --> 10:25.577
Mm.

10:27.892 --> 10:29.352
You would've torn him apart

10:29.354 --> 10:30.903
whether you meant to or not, probably

10:30.905 --> 10:32.800
doing the world a favor
in the process, but...

10:32.830 --> 10:33.990
I'm a vampire now, Klaus.

10:33.992 --> 10:35.762
Isn't that what we do?

10:36.090 --> 10:38.266
We hunt. We feed. We kill.

10:38.296 --> 10:39.327
We might want to keep

10:39.357 --> 10:40.980
our voices down just a little bit.

10:41.010 --> 10:43.471
Why? Can't we just compel anyone

10:43.501 --> 10:44.917
to do anything we want?

10:44.919 --> 10:46.274
Isn't that what you do all the time?

10:46.304 --> 10:48.888
What I do and what you
do are not the same thing.

10:48.890 --> 10:50.590
Now, I know our little
chats may have you feeling

10:50.592 --> 10:51.615
like you're quite the expert,

10:51.645 --> 10:53.960
but you're not equipped
to live in this world.

10:59.632 --> 11:02.218
Maybe you're right.

11:03.234 --> 11:04.993
My emotions are all over the place.

11:05.023 --> 11:07.946
I feel like someone turned up the volume

11:07.976 --> 11:10.098
on my life and I can't hear myself think,

11:10.128 --> 11:11.578
and everything feels so good,

11:11.580 --> 11:12.969
but it's all happening all at once.

11:12.999 --> 11:16.778
So let me help you, and I promise

11:16.808 --> 11:20.396
you will live a life others only dream of.

11:21.049 --> 11:23.488
Besides, if you're gonna learn,

11:23.490 --> 11:25.889
you may as well learn from the best.

11:38.979 --> 11:41.216
So it's really just a
simple suspension spell.

11:41.246 --> 11:42.717
The poison stops my heart,

11:42.719 --> 11:44.803
and the spell keep me from dying for good.

11:44.805 --> 11:48.055
Cool. Yeah. Now I'm totally on board,

11:48.085 --> 11:49.691
uh, just except for the part about

11:49.693 --> 11:51.898
the poison, your heart,
and whatever you said

11:51.928 --> 11:52.942
at the end there about dying.

11:52.972 --> 11:55.822
Josh, the witches won't even look at me,

11:55.852 --> 11:57.270
let alone help me.

11:57.300 --> 11:59.172
If I'm gonna find out if
that spell really works,

11:59.202 --> 12:00.869
I need to go to the only witch I trust,

12:00.871 --> 12:02.059
and that would be Kol.

12:02.089 --> 12:03.994
Hmm, your dead boyfriend
who currently resides

12:04.024 --> 12:05.607
in spooky witch purgatory along with

12:05.609 --> 12:08.171
all the other dead spirits who shunned you.

12:08.201 --> 12:10.160
Sure. What could possibly go wrong?

12:10.190 --> 12:12.781
Relax. I'm just gonna pop
over and pop back. Easy.

12:12.783 --> 12:15.460
All I need to do is channel your power.

12:15.490 --> 12:17.757
No. Uh, uh. No, no, no.

12:17.787 --> 12:19.370
You see this foot, Davina?

12:19.372 --> 12:21.122
This is me putting it down for once,

12:21.124 --> 12:23.708
ok, for your own good.

12:23.710 --> 12:27.078
- Oh...Easy.
- Oy.

12:27.450 --> 12:30.594
Uh, and you already took the poison,

12:30.624 --> 12:31.935
didn't you?

12:33.292 --> 12:34.525
Uh...

12:34.555 --> 12:36.914
Huh. Ok. For the record,
if you looked up "uncool"

12:36.944 --> 12:37.920
in the dictionary, there would just be

12:37.950 --> 12:41.085
a tiny, little drawing of
what's happening right now.

12:42.801 --> 12:44.562
What do I need to do?

13:03.770 --> 13:05.750
Whatever happens, don't let go, ok?

13:06.665 --> 13:08.970
You're my link to the living.

13:42.085 --> 13:43.938
Josh?

13:56.983 --> 13:59.670
We've searched for a seer for decades.

14:00.072 --> 14:03.122
Ultimately, we made a
rather startling discovery.

14:03.743 --> 14:08.128
Ariane, come forward, please.

14:15.137 --> 14:18.672
This is your secret weapon?

14:20.760 --> 14:23.233
She's untrained, of course,

14:23.263 --> 14:24.799
but she's shown a spark of talent

14:24.829 --> 14:28.249
which, in itself, is unbelievably rare.

14:28.251 --> 14:30.919
And what do you want from me?

14:30.921 --> 14:32.971
Witches like Ariane spend years absorbing

14:32.973 --> 14:35.223
all manner of information.

14:35.436 --> 14:37.342
They see patterns in the chaos in part

14:37.344 --> 14:39.477
because they view history as a whole.

14:39.479 --> 14:42.513
Sadly, we don't have that kind of time.

14:43.182 --> 14:44.732
Water will act as a conductor,

14:44.734 --> 14:46.768
allowing me to enter your mind

14:46.770 --> 14:49.687
to know everything you know to see

14:49.689 --> 14:51.773
and understand everything
that you've learned

14:51.775 --> 14:54.442
in a thousand years.

14:54.444 --> 14:57.445
Think of it as a crash
course into your mind,

14:57.447 --> 14:59.414
garnering just enough information

14:59.416 --> 15:03.201
to answer the only question that matters.

15:19.903 --> 15:22.353
What do you want to
take, your little knight?

15:22.355 --> 15:24.272
What about horsey?

15:29.696 --> 15:32.330
Bunny it is. Let's go.

15:52.204 --> 15:53.259
Ah!

15:53.289 --> 15:54.703
Stop it! Let go of me!

15:54.705 --> 15:56.621
Easy now. Easy now. Don't take off my head.

15:57.376 --> 15:58.244
Kol?

15:58.274 --> 16:01.242
Come on. You don't
recognize this roguish grin?

16:01.244 --> 16:03.361
I guess my true face is just too handsome.

16:03.363 --> 16:06.448
Heh. You certainly
sound like Kol Mikaelson.

16:06.450 --> 16:09.117
Oh, Davina Claire...

16:09.119 --> 16:12.337
Oh, you are a sight for
bleary and battered eyes.

16:12.652 --> 16:14.227
You're also stark raving mad.

16:14.257 --> 16:15.623
Oh, do you have any idea what would happen

16:15.625 --> 16:17.292
if the ancestors found you here?

16:20.067 --> 16:22.714
Come on. We can't stay here.

16:33.107 --> 16:36.011
Waah! Aagh!

16:46.377 --> 16:48.239
Did you see it, the weapon?

16:48.241 --> 16:50.597
All you family has endured,

16:50.627 --> 16:53.044
and yet the worst is still to come.

16:53.046 --> 16:56.047
An unending darkness lies before you,

16:56.049 --> 16:58.015
a lone figure...

17:00.270 --> 17:02.103
A pale horse,

17:02.105 --> 17:04.605
a flame that will burn you all.

17:19.632 --> 17:22.656
Don't move and don't make a sound.

17:24.210 --> 17:27.078
No one can help you. Do you understand?

17:28.414 --> 17:31.082
Young, healthy,

17:31.084 --> 17:35.002
a tad unsophisticated, but not bad.

17:36.183 --> 17:38.673
Listen to the heartbeat.

17:39.065 --> 17:41.309
It will tell you when to stop.

17:43.886 --> 17:45.457
Cami.

17:46.377 --> 17:48.172
Camille.

17:48.202 --> 17:50.318
- Enough!
- I'm sorry.

17:50.320 --> 17:51.358
Are you, of all people, offering me

17:51.388 --> 17:53.388
a lesson in restraint?

17:55.842 --> 17:57.608
Leave now.

17:57.943 --> 18:01.779
Forget my face and that
of my mouthy, blond friend.

18:03.533 --> 18:04.813
Oh...

18:06.870 --> 18:09.954
We should go. You're not yourself.

18:09.956 --> 18:12.290
I am myself, and I'm not finished,

18:12.292 --> 18:14.125
and, by the way, I resent the critique.

18:14.127 --> 18:15.493
I spent the last two years listening

18:15.495 --> 18:17.378
to every malicious thing you've ever done.

18:17.380 --> 18:20.369
How many hundreds of people
have you killed, Klaus?

18:20.399 --> 18:21.732
Actually, I measure the number

18:21.734 --> 18:23.206
in the hundreds of thousands,

18:23.236 --> 18:25.163
leaving me no hope of absolution.

18:26.776 --> 18:28.873
It's not a fate I wish for you.

18:28.875 --> 18:30.651
You don't get it.

18:30.681 --> 18:33.377
I've always tried to get
you to be something else,

18:33.379 --> 18:35.746
something more human, and I was wrong.

18:35.748 --> 18:40.580
You are exactly what you're meant to be,

18:40.610 --> 18:42.970
and now I'm just like you.

18:44.507 --> 18:48.559
You're still learning what you are.

18:48.561 --> 18:49.789
This...

18:50.637 --> 18:53.147
It's not you, Camille.

18:56.486 --> 18:58.395
You're right.

19:09.115 --> 19:10.675
It's better.

19:29.259 --> 19:30.423
Thank you.

19:30.954 --> 19:33.989
Ah! I'm sorry. I am such a klutz.

19:34.019 --> 19:35.628
No. No. It's fine.

19:35.658 --> 19:37.578
Cami, it's really great to see you.

19:37.608 --> 19:39.020
How... how are things?

19:39.050 --> 19:41.144
You know, same old same old. You?

19:41.174 --> 19:43.090
Can't complain, back on the job,

19:43.934 --> 19:45.464
which I have the strangest feeling

19:45.494 --> 19:47.327
is somehow thanks to you.

19:47.460 --> 19:49.451
You're a good cop, Will.

19:49.481 --> 19:52.532
Clearly, I'm not the only one who knows it.

19:52.534 --> 19:55.467
Ok. Ha! Full disclosure...

19:56.563 --> 19:58.872
This wasn't a total accident.

19:58.874 --> 20:00.987
I need a favor. Do you have a second?

20:01.017 --> 20:04.744
Yeah. Yeah. Want to take a walk?

20:09.971 --> 20:11.523
Are you gonna tell me what's going on?

20:11.553 --> 20:13.436
Bottom line, you don't belong here.

20:13.438 --> 20:15.689
Luckily, the ancestors
aren't big pub goers,

20:15.691 --> 20:18.413
more of the graveyard
and goat sacrifice types.

20:18.443 --> 20:19.476
We should be all right here till we can

20:19.478 --> 20:22.031
figure out how to get you back.

20:37.529 --> 20:38.944
I see.

20:39.275 --> 20:40.947
You preferred the other look more.

20:40.949 --> 20:43.283
No. I'm... I'm sorry. It's not that.

20:43.285 --> 20:45.195
I know it's you.

20:45.225 --> 20:47.370
It's just, you're so different.

20:47.372 --> 20:49.876
I'm still adjusting, not to mention

20:49.906 --> 20:52.824
we're in a freaky ghost land, so...

20:55.013 --> 20:58.882
I have an idea. Close your eyes.

21:02.341 --> 21:05.177
Think back to the last
night we were together,

21:05.207 --> 21:07.324
our last dance.

21:24.488 --> 21:28.187
God, I missed you, and for the record,

21:28.217 --> 21:30.118
I like this face just fine.

21:31.411 --> 21:33.350
- Really?
- Mm.

21:38.023 --> 21:39.689
Kol. What's happening to you here?

21:39.691 --> 21:42.442
It's nothing, really.

21:43.739 --> 21:45.779
You shouldn't have come here, Davina.

21:45.781 --> 21:47.914
There's a darkness to this place.

21:47.916 --> 21:50.083
Kol, I had to find you.

21:50.085 --> 21:52.836
I think I found a way to bring you back.

22:08.065 --> 22:10.637
It was under the
floorboards, like you said.

22:10.639 --> 22:12.355
What is all this, anyway?

22:12.357 --> 22:14.149
Oh, you know how it is.
Things go wrong with a guy,

22:14.179 --> 22:15.757
and he still has a bunch of your stuff.

22:15.787 --> 22:19.467
Oh, these are gonna come in really handy.

22:19.497 --> 22:21.698
Why am I doing everything you say?

22:21.700 --> 22:24.074
This is crazy... breaking
and entering, grand larceny.

22:24.104 --> 22:25.896
You're doing it because
I asked you so nicely.

22:25.897 --> 22:28.430
- But why...
- Because I can't go in myself.

22:28.460 --> 22:30.327
But why are you doing this?

22:30.357 --> 22:31.541
Because I have been the victim

22:31.543 --> 22:33.460
in someone else's story one too many times.

22:33.462 --> 22:34.761
I want back what's mine,

22:34.763 --> 22:37.052
and now I have the power to take it.

22:37.831 --> 22:40.772
I admit, even given
your new outlook on life,

22:40.802 --> 22:43.586
I'm surprised at your
willingness to compel,

22:43.588 --> 22:46.806
past protestations of
free will and all that.

22:46.808 --> 22:51.093
What can I say? I've changed.

22:51.744 --> 22:53.060
You're a fast learner, Camille...

22:53.090 --> 22:57.016
I'll give you that... But don't push it.

23:01.277 --> 23:03.242
Sorry to break it to you, luv.

23:03.272 --> 23:05.077
It's a fake.

23:05.753 --> 23:08.911
Looks like someone's trying
to put one over on you.

23:09.224 --> 23:13.293
You're lying. Why? Don't you get it?

23:13.323 --> 23:16.619
You can live again.
Isn't that what you want?

23:20.574 --> 23:23.209
More than anything, Davina Claire,

23:23.385 --> 23:24.718
but do you have any idea

23:24.748 --> 23:27.246
how dangerous that spell is?

23:27.276 --> 23:29.397
I haven't seen anything
even remotely like it

23:29.427 --> 23:30.596
since...

23:33.960 --> 23:35.888
the Strix coven.

23:37.813 --> 23:40.643
This is their work, isn't it?

23:42.090 --> 23:44.097
Please tell me you haven't
done something foolish.

23:44.099 --> 23:46.588
They can give me power, Kol, real power.

23:46.618 --> 23:47.720
I can bring you back.

23:47.750 --> 23:50.120
Find another way, luv, not with them.

23:50.122 --> 23:53.623
Nothing is worth what they'll make you do.

23:55.254 --> 23:57.293
The ancestors,

23:58.456 --> 24:00.620
they're close.

24:14.729 --> 24:17.480
Go! Go! Walk in the bar!

24:59.024 --> 25:00.390
You have no right.

25:00.392 --> 25:02.275
Those dark objects are my family's legacy.

25:02.277 --> 25:03.860
Well, that's funny
because I seem to remember

25:03.862 --> 25:06.192
my brother Kol making them,
so perhaps they've been

25:06.222 --> 25:08.198
my family's legacy all along.

25:08.979 --> 25:12.090
Give them back, or I will take them back,

25:12.120 --> 25:14.204
and I swear you will regret this moment.

25:14.206 --> 25:16.768
The only thing I regret
is failing to realize

25:16.798 --> 25:18.541
how far you've spun out of control,

25:18.543 --> 25:20.710
and you can forget about leaving.

25:20.712 --> 25:24.047
She was right, wasn't she, Aurora?

25:24.288 --> 25:25.965
She did this to turn you against me,

25:25.967 --> 25:27.417
to rob me of the one advantage

25:27.419 --> 25:29.419
I have over her... my humanity,

25:29.421 --> 25:31.421
and me like this, it's a problem for you,

25:31.423 --> 25:34.480
isn't it, not the darkness,
that you find intriguing,

25:34.510 --> 25:35.675
the fact that I am out of control.

25:35.677 --> 25:38.228
I'm out of your control,
and you hate it, don't you?

25:38.258 --> 25:41.499
You have spent 10 centuries
getting the entire world

25:41.529 --> 25:43.066
to tremble at your name when really,

25:44.068 --> 25:46.402
you are the one who's terrified, Klaus.

25:46.404 --> 25:48.988
You are a scared, little kid

25:48.990 --> 25:51.157
convinced he'll be tossed aside

25:51.159 --> 25:54.077
the second he isn't needed.

25:54.863 --> 25:56.696
Ha! Let go of me.

25:56.698 --> 25:59.582
You can't just force
her to stay here, Klaus.

26:01.036 --> 26:02.619
Finally, someone who's on my side.

26:02.621 --> 26:04.170
Oh, don't get me wrong.

26:04.172 --> 26:05.588
I remember when I
turned, and you, for sure,

26:05.590 --> 26:07.423
shouldn't have a box
of witch crap right now,

26:07.425 --> 26:10.343
but you can't hold her hostage, either.

26:10.345 --> 26:11.314
Let me talk to her.

26:11.344 --> 26:12.526
I hardly thing now is the time

26:12.556 --> 26:14.264
for a women's empowerment meeting.

26:14.266 --> 26:16.785
She died, Klaus, because she got caught up

26:16.815 --> 26:19.602
in the Mikaelson world just like me,

26:20.108 --> 26:23.800
just like Jackson, so, yeah,

26:23.830 --> 26:25.604
she and I have ‭a few
things to talk about.

26:25.634 --> 26:27.527
Niklaus...

26:32.234 --> 26:33.866
A word.

26:43.793 --> 26:45.299
Now, where did you cross over?

26:45.329 --> 26:46.496
The church... Saint Anne's.

26:46.498 --> 26:47.747
All right. You keep going,
no matter what happens.

26:47.749 --> 26:51.000
If I fall behind, don't look back.

26:51.716 --> 26:53.419
Hello, Davina.

27:00.304 --> 27:01.274
I thought the pale horse

27:01.304 --> 27:03.377
might be something biblical or even tied

27:03.407 --> 27:04.835
to one of the equestrian constellations.

27:04.837 --> 27:08.960
There's Pegasus, perhaps even Equuleus.

27:08.990 --> 27:10.328
Neither of those sounds like a weapon

27:10.358 --> 27:12.158
unless they plan to bore us to death.

27:12.160 --> 27:14.494
You know, it would be nice if, just once,

27:14.496 --> 27:16.913
the witches bloody well
said what they mean.

27:16.915 --> 27:20.500
Camille has just turned, Niklaus.

27:21.053 --> 27:22.452
Leave her be.

27:27.313 --> 27:29.292
You think I should abandon her, then?

27:29.294 --> 27:30.710
She's already served as a pawn

27:30.712 --> 27:32.095
in Aurora's games.

27:32.097 --> 27:34.013
Her distance would be a mercy.

27:34.015 --> 27:39.045
I need you. A storm is coming.

27:41.272 --> 27:43.139
Look. I know it may not
seem like it right now,

27:43.141 --> 27:44.218
but what you're going through,

27:44.248 --> 27:46.164
it does get better, and there are people

27:46.194 --> 27:47.493
around you that are willing

27:47.495 --> 27:49.529
to get you to that part.

27:51.961 --> 27:52.866
Cami.

27:52.868 --> 27:55.084
Yes. That's very sweet, Hayley,

27:55.381 --> 27:57.370
and I think you should
take your own advice.

27:57.978 --> 28:00.506
I mean, that is why you
wanted to speak to me,

28:00.508 --> 28:02.175
right, to get some words of wisdom

28:02.177 --> 28:04.427
from the Mikaelson family therapist?

28:04.629 --> 28:05.962
I say admit it.

28:05.964 --> 28:08.548
It's not grief. It's relief.

28:08.550 --> 28:10.383
What did you just say?

28:10.385 --> 28:12.668
Oh, come on. It's just us girls.

28:12.670 --> 28:14.837
You don't have to deny it. It's obvious.

28:14.839 --> 28:16.889
You're in love with Elijah,

28:16.891 --> 28:20.009
and now that Jackson's gone, you're free.

28:20.011 --> 28:25.264
It must be nice, like a weight lifted.

28:26.178 --> 28:27.316
Hmm.

28:32.616 --> 28:34.023
You're going through a really hard time

28:34.025 --> 28:39.362
right now, Cami, but you are never

28:39.392 --> 28:42.331
ever to speak to me of my husband again.

28:42.333 --> 28:44.617
Do you understand me?

28:47.921 --> 28:49.172
I...

28:51.376 --> 28:54.594
I don't know what's wrong with me.

28:54.596 --> 28:56.929
Why would I say that?

28:56.931 --> 28:59.715
You're manic. It's part of it.

29:03.021 --> 29:06.222
I think I wanted to make you feel

29:06.224 --> 29:10.276
pain like I do, and so I said

29:10.278 --> 29:15.292
an evil, unfair thing,
an untrue thing, Hayley.

29:15.322 --> 29:18.117
Forget it. You're not you.

29:19.320 --> 29:21.037
I thought I could handle this.

29:21.039 --> 29:24.546
You can. You will.

29:25.471 --> 29:27.493
You just need time.

29:28.905 --> 29:31.881
I think maybe I should go home.

29:41.266 --> 29:42.925
No one can help you now,

29:42.927 --> 29:45.178
certainly not the spirit of a dead vampire.

29:45.180 --> 29:47.513
All right. ‭That's
about enough out of you.

29:48.816 --> 29:50.300
Kol!

29:51.319 --> 29:53.286
Aah!

30:04.782 --> 30:06.866
Nngh...

30:14.592 --> 30:16.842
Now I'm gonna make you suffer

30:16.844 --> 30:20.296
the way you made me suffer.

30:21.516 --> 30:23.299
- Leave...
- Uh!

30:23.301 --> 30:24.850
Now.

30:26.690 --> 30:27.637
Uh...

30:30.180 --> 30:33.309
I can help you cross back,
but we have to go now.

30:36.221 --> 30:37.897
Where is Camille?

30:37.899 --> 30:39.365
She went home.

30:39.367 --> 30:42.868
She needed some time,
and, yes, I let her go.

30:43.345 --> 30:44.704
I know you think you're helping,

30:44.706 --> 30:46.289
but all you're doing is pissing her off,

30:46.291 --> 30:48.324
and that's the last thing
that she needs, trust me.

30:48.326 --> 30:50.042
I really don't think th...

30:50.044 --> 30:52.128
Listen, Klaus.

30:52.130 --> 30:54.797
The Cami that you knew is gone,

30:54.799 --> 30:56.165
and whoever she's gonna be is something

30:56.167 --> 30:58.801
that she has to figure out by herself.

31:02.583 --> 31:04.257
I just wanted to keep her safe.

31:04.259 --> 31:06.225
Yeah? Well, guess what.

31:06.227 --> 31:08.427
The people you think you're keeping safe...

31:08.429 --> 31:10.896
Elijah, Rebekah, even Hope...

31:10.898 --> 31:13.683
sometimes you do them more harm than good.

31:18.273 --> 31:20.189
What?

31:20.191 --> 31:22.775
What you just said,

31:22.777 --> 31:25.911
keeping Rebekah safe.

31:25.913 --> 31:31.033
I know what the weapon
is. I made it myself.

31:45.899 --> 31:47.376
Go. I'll handle them,

31:47.406 --> 31:48.919
at least buy you a minute or two.

31:50.117 --> 31:51.833
No. We're not leaving without him.

31:51.835 --> 31:54.586
He can't come where we're going, not yet.

31:54.588 --> 31:56.204
If we leave now, we can come back.

31:56.206 --> 31:57.589
No. No.

31:57.591 --> 31:59.174
If you don't go now, we're both lost.

31:59.176 --> 32:01.626
Besides, this way, you owe me one,

32:01.628 --> 32:02.928
and don't think for a second

32:02.930 --> 32:05.797
I won't aim to collect.

32:05.799 --> 32:07.716
Go. Go!

32:11.055 --> 32:14.189
All right. Let's see what you've got.

32:30.374 --> 32:33.458
It's too late. My link to Josh is broken.

32:35.245 --> 32:38.130
I know you're scared, but
you have to concentrate.

32:41.075 --> 32:43.051
Focus on what you love most.

32:43.053 --> 32:45.554
Recall the thing that
makes you want to live.

32:45.973 --> 32:48.562
Fight with that in mind.

32:49.277 --> 32:51.643
Kol, I swear I'll come back for you.

32:57.754 --> 32:59.735
All of my efforts to protect

32:59.737 --> 33:01.653
and provide comfort for my family...

33:01.655 --> 33:03.271
Klaus, you're not making any sense.

33:03.273 --> 33:05.240
The pale horse, it isn't a constellation,

33:05.242 --> 33:06.508
nor is is a biblical verse.

33:06.538 --> 33:09.277
It's a... a trinket I
made when we were children,

33:09.279 --> 33:11.696
a toy carved from kindling
which I gave to Rebekah

33:11.698 --> 33:16.118
in the hopes of easing her fears.

33:16.565 --> 33:18.170
I collected the firewood myself.

33:18.172 --> 33:21.289
It was fallen branches
from everywhere, and...

33:25.122 --> 33:27.212
The horse was made of the white oak.

33:30.401 --> 33:32.134
That weapon is here.

33:40.194 --> 33:43.779
Josh, you awake?

33:43.781 --> 33:48.033
It's both the blessing
and curse of his kind.

33:48.356 --> 33:49.734
Why did you help me?

33:49.736 --> 33:53.205
Because Aya wanted you saved.

33:54.578 --> 33:56.458
Wait.

33:57.742 --> 33:59.214
Aya said that the witches of your coven

33:59.244 --> 34:00.656
were granted the power to have

34:00.686 --> 34:02.998
your greatest heart's desire.

34:03.303 --> 34:05.217
Did you make that deal?

34:05.219 --> 34:10.222
Yes, and I will answer
your real question, as well.

34:10.893 --> 34:12.757
It was worth it.

34:20.266 --> 34:22.150
This doesn't make any sense.

34:22.152 --> 34:24.235
It was here. I saw it.

34:26.190 --> 34:27.405
When?

34:27.407 --> 34:29.491
This afternoon, I swear.

34:29.493 --> 34:30.909
Oh, I believe you.

34:30.911 --> 34:33.360
We're just here a little too late.

34:33.362 --> 34:35.746
And Rebekah was so afraid
of the coming storm,

34:35.748 --> 34:39.201
I told her the brave
knight would protect her.

34:39.914 --> 34:41.786
Look, Cami. I know it may not feel like it

34:41.788 --> 34:43.121
right now, but what you're going through...

34:43.123 --> 34:44.456
I thought the pale horse

34:44.458 --> 34:45.841
might be something biblical or even tied

34:45.842 --> 34:47.792
to one of the equestrian constellations,

34:47.822 --> 34:49.344
perhaps even Equuleus.

34:49.346 --> 34:51.379
Neither of those sounds like a weapon.

34:51.380 --> 34:53.098
There is only one other person capable

34:53.100 --> 34:54.549
of deciphering the witch's riddle,

34:54.551 --> 34:56.967
the very person with
whom I shared my memories

34:56.969 --> 35:00.690
of that night... my trusted therapist.

35:23.890 --> 35:25.760
You, uh... You drink now?

35:25.762 --> 35:28.442
Um, I guess getting shunned

35:28.472 --> 35:30.465
is a slippery slope.

35:32.290 --> 35:33.434
Josh, I know I didn't give you

35:33.436 --> 35:34.969
much of a choice today...

35:34.971 --> 35:38.272
Any choice, just to be clear.

35:38.274 --> 35:39.345
But thank you.

35:39.375 --> 35:40.792
You've always been there for me,

35:40.794 --> 35:41.731
and sometimes I forget

35:41.761 --> 35:43.962
just how much that means.

35:49.186 --> 35:51.251
Yep. You know, when Aiden died,

35:51.253 --> 35:53.887
there were days when I
would sit in Jackson Square

35:55.140 --> 35:57.964
just daring myself to take this ring off,

35:57.994 --> 36:00.377
to give up, and I think part of me

36:00.379 --> 36:03.330
knew that I was never gonna be that happy

36:03.332 --> 36:05.549
ever again.

36:10.473 --> 36:15.092
If there was any way to bring Aiden back,

36:15.094 --> 36:19.179
I would, no matter what.

36:22.289 --> 36:24.164
If there's even chance for you to be

36:24.194 --> 36:26.710
with the guy you want to be with...

36:29.493 --> 36:32.243
You got to do it.

36:38.000 --> 36:41.285
I'm guessing you might be
a little bit mad right now,

36:41.287 --> 36:43.459
but, trust me, you have
nothing to worry about.

36:43.489 --> 36:45.156
I just want back what's mine,

36:45.158 --> 36:46.429
starting with my dark objects,

36:46.459 --> 36:48.209
and I figured I needed
to get your attention.

36:48.211 --> 36:50.178
So do I have it?

36:51.182 --> 36:54.348
In point of fact, you do.

36:55.057 --> 36:58.102
Good. Then we'll be in touch.

37:17.443 --> 37:19.957
You found it...

37:25.544 --> 37:27.799
Which means you've come to kill me.

37:29.390 --> 37:32.587
We both know I have no
more answers to give you,

37:33.789 --> 37:36.841
and you cannot allow me to
live with what I've seen...

37:39.847 --> 37:42.513
The things you keep hidden.

37:54.690 --> 37:56.444
I am released.

38:28.189 --> 38:31.112
I haven't seen you around in a bit.

38:31.114 --> 38:33.531
Ah, seems like we've both been busy.

38:35.325 --> 38:36.868
So what you been up to?

38:36.870 --> 38:38.482
Been doing a lot of thinking

38:38.512 --> 38:41.822
about what's important... friends.

38:42.534 --> 38:44.242
Friends are important,

38:44.634 --> 38:47.328
which is why I wanted to talk to you...

38:48.949 --> 38:51.112
about the Strix...

38:52.203 --> 38:53.467
and what we're gonna do about the fact

38:53.469 --> 38:55.920
that Davina just became
one of their witches.

40:17.387 --> 40:19.220
I don't know what to say.

40:23.860 --> 40:27.663
Elijah, I've spent the last 24 hours

40:27.693 --> 40:31.899
being so angry

40:31.901 --> 40:34.185
at Tristan,

40:34.187 --> 40:37.104
at your family, at you...

40:41.828 --> 40:46.968
At Jackson, even, for
always being so brave.

40:52.680 --> 40:55.673
But then I realize that I'm not angry.

41:00.463 --> 41:02.179
I'm just guilty.

41:27.181 --> 41:30.708
I wanted to blame you,

41:31.237 --> 41:34.795
blame anyone...

41:38.084 --> 41:43.754
Oh, but the truth is that my husband died

41:44.385 --> 41:46.140
because he loved me...

41:51.147 --> 41:53.514
And loving any of us is a death sentence,

41:53.516 --> 41:55.316
isn't it?
