JOHNSON: <i>Previously,
on</i> Masters of Sex...

00:15.074 --> 00:17.512
I am talking about intimacy.

00:17.513 --> 00:18.748
JOHNSON: <i>Daddy?</i>

00:18.749 --> 00:19.884
What are you doing here, honey?

00:19.884 --> 00:21.554
Is Mom here?

00:21.555 --> 00:22.756
Does this look like a place
your mother would come?

00:22.757 --> 00:24.258
That is what we refer to as lost wages.

00:24.259 --> 00:26.229
You're a secretary. You're not a lawyer.

00:26.230 --> 00:28.400
Have you ever heard of a woman my age

00:28.401 --> 00:30.805
taking classes or going back to school?

00:30.806 --> 00:32.776
Are those my first patients of the day?

00:32.777 --> 00:34.980
No, that's the homosexual and his wife.

00:34.981 --> 00:37.151
Our supposedly homosexual
patient happened to achieve

00:37.152 --> 00:38.821
an erection last night with his wife!

00:38.822 --> 00:41.226
Because he was listening to you.

00:41.227 --> 00:43.263
This needs to be a study.
Art, how do you feel

00:43.264 --> 00:44.600
about laying the groundwork?

00:44.601 --> 00:46.402
I'm going to meet Mr. Clavermore.

00:46.403 --> 00:48.006
- Shh.
- NANCY: I turned it off.

00:48.007 --> 00:49.308
We can make a fresh start,

00:49.309 --> 00:51.780
the two of us together
at our own clinic.

00:51.781 --> 00:52.782
In New York.

00:52.783 --> 00:54.318
Louise.

00:54.319 --> 00:55.955
I shouldn't have just
showed up like this.

00:55.956 --> 00:58.360
Just not everyone here knows
that I attend AA meetings.

00:58.361 --> 01:00.264
This isn't about AA.

01:00.265 --> 01:02.636
LOUISE: <i>My husband was
paralyzed from the waist down,</i>

01:02.637 --> 01:06.042
<i>and I was just hoping you
could explain all this to me.</i>

01:06.043 --> 01:07.712
NANCY: <i>You know that right now,</i>

01:07.713 --> 01:09.215

02:52.857 --> 02:54.391
I've typed up the notes
that Bill and I took

02:54.392 --> 02:56.597
over the course of our
treatment in Topeka.

02:56.598 --> 02:59.101
These have already been sent
to our lawyer, of course.

02:59.102 --> 03:00.705
So what happens next?

03:00.706 --> 03:02.307
A cease and desist letter
was sent this morning.

03:02.308 --> 03:04.211
We believe, based on the evidence...

03:04.212 --> 03:08.186
Sorry I'm late. I must
have lost track of time.

03:08.187 --> 03:10.892
No problem at all. We were
just getting started.

03:10.893 --> 03:12.929
So we believe that we're
looking at a case

03:12.930 --> 03:14.866
of copyright infringement,

03:14.867 --> 03:17.171
possibly patent infringement as well.

03:17.172 --> 03:19.910
NANCY: So, uh, any sex clinic
whose work happens to be

03:19.911 --> 03:22.949
inspired by Masters and Johnson
is committing a crime?

03:22.950 --> 03:25.287
Oh, inspiration is different than theft.

03:25.288 --> 03:26.924
The Toplins' intake questionnaire

03:26.925 --> 03:29.395
was nearly word-for-word
the same as ours,

03:29.396 --> 03:31.867
as was their protocol for
ejaculatory incompetence.

03:31.868 --> 03:33.971
Why didn't they just
rephrase the questions

03:33.972 --> 03:35.373
and alter the protocols?

03:35.374 --> 03:36.877
We will have a cease and desist letter

03:36.878 --> 03:38.581
sent to the Toplins as soon as possible.

03:38.582 --> 03:41.887
We already discussed that.
Bram sent one this morning.

03:41.888 --> 03:43.791
- You spoke to Bram?
- Called him first thing.

03:43.792 --> 03:46.062
NANCY: A lot of this hasn't even
been published yet, has it?

03:46.063 --> 03:48.233
The sensate instructions,
the questionnaire,

03:48.234 --> 03:49.603
none of that is in your book.

03:49.604 --> 03:51.072
Correct.

03:51.073 --> 03:52.508
ART: You're wondering how they got it.

03:52.509 --> 03:53.911
NANCY: It's obvious how they got it.

03:53.912 --> 03:55.748
You left it on the bureau last night.

03:55.749 --> 03:57.184
NANCY: a pair of
charlatans, two therapists

03:57.185 --> 03:59.422
posing as patients to
steal our material.

03:59.423 --> 04:02.060
Which means we need stricter
screening procedures

04:02.061 --> 04:03.898
for all potential new patients,

04:03.899 --> 04:06.737
and our lawyer advised us

04:06.738 --> 04:09.976
to get signed copies of this

04:09.977 --> 04:12.415
from all staff members by
the beginning of next week.

04:12.416 --> 04:13.884
That includes Guy and Lester.

04:13.885 --> 04:15.387
A non-disclosure agreement?

04:15.388 --> 04:17.124
Is that really necessary?

04:17.125 --> 04:18.827
JOHNSON: Well, the last thing
we want is somebody coming

04:18.827 --> 04:20.397
to work at the clinic, and then leaving

04:20.398 --> 04:24.171
with our work and starting
a rival business.

04:24.172 --> 04:27.178
No. No, of course that makes sense.

04:29.684 --> 04:32.354
I'm surprised the phone
didn't wake you this morning.

04:32.355 --> 04:33.924
My parents called at 6:00

04:33.925 --> 04:36.663
to give their customary
eight-hours notice.

04:36.664 --> 04:39.335
They're coming to St. Louis,
staying through the weekend,

04:39.336 --> 04:41.974
and for some reason,
my father is insisting

04:41.975 --> 04:45.180
that they stay in a hotel,
so at least it won't be

04:45.181 --> 04:47.453
a problem for us to stay
in the house together.

04:48.655 --> 04:50.357
Good.

04:50.358 --> 04:52.161
I know what you're going to say. I...

04:53.965 --> 04:55.969
JOHNSON: Mmm.

04:57.338 --> 05:01.078
Ohh. (SIGHS)

05:01.079 --> 05:03.116
You should've woken me before
you left this morning.

05:03.117 --> 05:06.456
(SIGHS) Neither of us got
any sleep last night.

05:06.457 --> 05:08.092
Mmm.

05:08.093 --> 05:10.263
I thought it was best if one
of us got an extra few hours.

05:10.264 --> 05:11.800
But we had a meeting
at 9:00 this morning.

05:11.801 --> 05:13.302
I'm still in yesterday's clothes.

05:13.303 --> 05:15.006
Didn't you get my note?
I told you not to worry

05:15.007 --> 05:17.478
about the meeting, I'd handle it.

05:17.479 --> 05:19.783
Mmm. And you spoke to Keller without me.

05:19.784 --> 05:22.020
I thought it was important
to get the legal process

05:22.021 --> 05:24.224
started immediately.
Is there anything else

05:24.225 --> 05:25.995
that I've done wrong that
you want to tell me about?

05:25.996 --> 05:28.132

05:28.133 --> 05:31.305

05:31.306 --> 05:33.977

they could had easily inferred

05:33.978 --> 05:35.180
that we were sleeping together.

05:35.181 --> 05:36.483
We are.

05:36.484 --> 05:39.490
What is it that we're hiding exactly?

05:40.725 --> 05:43.597
You don't have a wife anymore, Bill.

05:43.598 --> 05:46.235
I don't have a husband.

05:46.236 --> 05:48.106
Have we just gotten so
used to keeping secrets,

05:48.107 --> 05:51.113
that we've forgotten that
we don't have to anymore?

05:53.885 --> 05:55.955
Mmm.

05:55.956 --> 06:00.532
Things are just... moving very quickly.

06:06.209 --> 06:08.881
Take all the time you need.

06:08.882 --> 06:10.885
Go home, take a shower.

06:10.886 --> 06:15.594

06:40.211 --> 06:42.280
I'm filling in. Louise hasn't shown up

06:42.281 --> 06:44.051
to any meetings this week.

any personal information

it, which I don't.

on the thrusting just a tad.

a sidewalk after all.

me about those forms.

07:16.751 --> 07:19.756
Virginia said she didn't need
them signed until next week.

07:19.757 --> 07:22.595
Okay, now, let's switch
to female superior.

07:22.596 --> 07:25.601
We won't have the forms
signed ever, Nancy.

07:25.602 --> 07:27.237
We can't.

07:27.238 --> 07:28.306
As soon as we put pen to paper, we're...

07:28.307 --> 07:30.644
- Shh, shh, stop.

07:30.645 --> 07:32.948
I think Monday morning will
give us plenty of time

07:32.949 --> 07:34.952
to look over the forms.

07:34.953 --> 07:36.623
This position, you'll notice,

07:36.624 --> 07:39.027
allows for better stimulation
of the clitoris.

07:39.028 --> 07:42.167
We'll have to, um, shift
things around though.

07:42.168 --> 07:44.839
The conversation we talked about having

07:44.840 --> 07:48.212
with Mr. Drag next week, for example,

07:48.213 --> 07:51.519
about his treatment plan?

07:51.520 --> 07:53.790
Why don't you go ahead and
talk to him about it today?

07:53.791 --> 07:56.896
I still have some concerns about...

07:56.897 --> 07:59.067
the treatment plan as we discussed it.

07:59.068 --> 08:00.537
Such as?

08:00.538 --> 08:01.973
Such a...

08:01.974 --> 08:04.144
That's right, look into
each other's eyes.

08:04.145 --> 08:06.649
Share the moment together. That's right.

08:06.650 --> 08:11.659
Such as the fact that Bill and Virginia

08:11.660 --> 08:15.801
might object to the number
of follow-up appointments

08:15.802 --> 08:17.303
that we would like to schedule.

08:17.304 --> 08:19.809
I-I think you're being overly sensitive.

08:19.810 --> 08:22.380
I'm sure that Bill and Virginia
would happily defer to us

08:22.381 --> 08:25.621
when it comes to the day-to-day
management of the case.

08:40.518 --> 08:42.422
<i>You can get changed and join us outside.</i>

08:45.093 --> 08:47.532
Don't forget, we deserve this.

08:50.070 --> 08:52.207
Uh, anyway,

08:52.208 --> 08:56.449
the woman I've discussed
in these meetings before...

08:56.450 --> 08:59.455
for months now, I've done
everything I can to resist her.

08:59.456 --> 09:02.293
I have put up every imaginable barrier,

09:02.294 --> 09:05.299
but somehow...

09:05.300 --> 09:10.310
uh, all the defenses that I had
so carefully constructed...

09:11.914 --> 09:15.988
they all just, uh... just collapsed.

09:15.989 --> 09:19.194
I mean, in an instant.

09:19.195 --> 09:21.933

09:21.934 --> 09:25.072
well, I guess I've fallen off the wagon.

BRENDA: And I don't
know what to tell you.

09:31.754 --> 09:35.126
The people in this room,
we're all alcoholics.

09:35.127 --> 09:37.765
That's what we're here to discuss.

09:37.766 --> 09:41.573
Your problem seems to be about...
some woman.

09:41.574 --> 09:43.208
But is-is there a difference?

09:43.209 --> 09:45.213
I mean, I mean, isn't
addiction addiction?

09:46.717 --> 09:47.751
Who would like to share?

09:47.752 --> 09:50.256
Look, I-I'm sorry, but...

09:50.257 --> 09:51.759
I have sat here week after week,

09:51.760 --> 09:53.897
listening to everyone else's problems,

09:53.898 --> 09:55.767
and to be honest, that
meant weeks of listening

09:55.768 --> 09:58.072
to a lot of self-pitying stories,

09:58.073 --> 10:00.009
belly-achers blaming everyone else

10:00.010 --> 10:01.579
for their problems.

10:01.580 --> 10:04.619
Greta, it was your sister
that got the ballet lessons,

10:04.620 --> 10:05.821
and that's why you grew up to drink

10:05.822 --> 10:07.458
half a bottle of Jim Beam every night.

10:07.459 --> 10:09.094
We don't use other members' testimonies.

10:09.095 --> 10:12.133
If only Alan's wife didn't
snore like a terrier,

10:12.134 --> 10:14.538
you know, he would never have
turned to mixing Canadian Club

10:14.539 --> 10:16.341
with sleeping pills in the first place.

10:16.342 --> 10:18.713
It's the same, isn't it? You feel bad,

10:18.714 --> 10:20.784
so you drink to... to numb the pain,

10:20.785 --> 10:22.688
and then when it wears
off, lo and behold,

10:22.689 --> 10:25.159
you feel even worse, so
it's back to the bottle.

10:25.160 --> 10:28.967
And then the cycle
goes on and on and on.

10:28.968 --> 10:30.804
Because it's not the drinking!

10:30.805 --> 10:32.474
Or... or... or the pills or the whatever

10:32.475 --> 10:34.712
that you're addicted to... not really,

10:34.713 --> 10:38.053
I suppose any more than it is
that I'm addicted to Virginia.

10:40.425 --> 10:42.326
Well...

10:42.327 --> 10:45.767
what we need, what we crave...

10:45.768 --> 10:47.538
is the feeling bad part,

10:47.539 --> 10:51.547
the blaming and... and the guilt
and... and the shame and...

10:53.617 --> 10:58.025
we only feel like ourselves...

10:58.026 --> 11:02.968
we only know who we are...

11:02.969 --> 11:06.408
when we feel worthless.

11:11.152 --> 11:13.355

dinner at the Marmaduke.

11:16.062 --> 11:18.165
Your mother wanted to spend
the afternoon shopping,

11:18.166 --> 11:20.035
and you know how I get
around department stores.

11:20.036 --> 11:24.277
Yes, like it's the Bataan Death March.

11:24.278 --> 11:26.415
Actually, um, I was wondering

11:26.416 --> 11:28.353
if I could have a moment of your time.

11:30.056 --> 11:32.261
Yes, of course. Sit.

11:43.751 --> 11:45.286
I've have to level with you, honey.

11:45.287 --> 11:47.323
We didn't come here just to see Lisa...

11:47.324 --> 11:49.495
although we did bring
plenty of presents,

11:49.496 --> 11:52.166
don't you worry about that.

11:52.167 --> 11:54.972
I suppose it clicked
for me when I saw you

11:54.973 --> 11:56.809
at that seminar last week.

11:56.810 --> 11:59.180
Here I am, searching high and low

11:59.181 --> 12:01.886
to find the secret of
fixing my marriage,

12:01.887 --> 12:06.094
when the answer has been
in front of me all along.

12:06.095 --> 12:08.031
You came for... treatment?

12:08.032 --> 12:09.400
That's why I booked the hotel room,

12:09.401 --> 12:11.037
because I thought your
mother and I would need

12:11.038 --> 12:14.945
a place to work on the
assignments and such.

12:14.946 --> 12:17.784
And obviously, we would want
to see one of your colleagues.

12:17.785 --> 12:19.822
I understand this is not a subject

12:19.823 --> 12:21.826
you want to be discussing
with your parents.

12:21.827 --> 12:23.395
Yes, I would certainly recommend

12:23.396 --> 12:26.101
that somebody else oversee the case.

12:26.102 --> 12:28.840
I'm sor... I'm so surprised

12:28.841 --> 12:31.747
that you got Mom to go along with this.

12:34.318 --> 12:36.021
She has no idea.

12:36.022 --> 12:37.791
If I'd have told her,
she wouldn't have come.

12:37.792 --> 12:40.463
When were you planning
on breaking the news?

12:40.464 --> 12:43.636
Actually, I was hoping
that you would consider

12:43.637 --> 12:45.607
introducing the idea to her first.

12:45.608 --> 12:48.780
You want me to talk
Mom into sex therapy?

12:48.781 --> 12:52.053
I would never ask this of
you, Gini, except that...

12:52.054 --> 12:55.060
Except you are.

12:57.230 --> 13:01.404
Well, I thought today was a
very productive session.

13:01.405 --> 13:04.912
Frankly, I'm not sure I'd be
achieving the same results

13:04.913 --> 13:07.116
with Bill and Virginia.

13:07.117 --> 13:09.955
Look, those two, they're the greatest.

13:09.956 --> 13:14.665
They're the Fred and Ginger
of sexual dysfunction,

13:14.666 --> 13:18.973
but ever since you came on board,

13:18.974 --> 13:21.812
you've blown the whole thing wide open.

13:21.813 --> 13:25.553
Until next week?

13:25.554 --> 13:28.392
Actually, there's something I was hoping

13:28.393 --> 13:30.797
to bring up with you.

13:30.798 --> 13:33.736
It's somewhat... well...

13:33.737 --> 13:35.173
it's... it's delicate.

13:39.649 --> 13:43.188
Nancy and I have a proposal for you,

13:43.189 --> 13:46.529
an idea for a book.

13:46.530 --> 13:48.398
A book, I see.

13:48.399 --> 13:51.271
We've just begun a major new
study on homosexuality.

13:51.272 --> 13:52.841
We've already seen dozens of subjects.

13:52.842 --> 13:54.277
We plan to bring in hundreds more

13:54.278 --> 13:55.279
by the time all is said and done.

13:55.280 --> 13:56.782
When you say "we,"

13:56.783 --> 13:59.955
who exactly are we talking about?

13:59.956 --> 14:01.224
Nancy and me.

14:01.225 --> 14:02.461
Dr. Masters and Mrs. Johnson,

14:02.462 --> 14:03.963
they're not involved in the study?

14:03.964 --> 14:05.533
They've left much of the nitty-gritty

14:05.534 --> 14:07.069
to the two of us.

14:07.070 --> 14:08.806
Based on my work at
the Kinsey Institute,

14:08.807 --> 14:10.375
I am something of a
specialist in the subject.

14:10.376 --> 14:12.714
So they know about this book idea?

14:12.715 --> 14:15.687
We haven't formally broached
the subject yet, no,

14:15.688 --> 14:17.824
but I have every reason to
assume they'll be supportive.

14:17.825 --> 14:19.761
Even if I believe you,
I'm in the business

14:19.762 --> 14:21.064
of selling books.

14:21.065 --> 14:22.701
"Masters and Johnson," that's a name

14:22.702 --> 14:25.607
the consumer has come to know and trust.

14:25.608 --> 14:27.711
"Dreessen and Leveau?"

14:27.712 --> 14:29.915
That just sounds like a
Dutch guy and a Frenchman

14:29.916 --> 14:33.624
with a personal injury practice.
With all due respect.

14:35.360 --> 14:38.298
What if I could promise you
that was about to change?

14:38.299 --> 14:40.537
Nancy and I are opening our own practice

14:40.538 --> 14:42.908
in New York City.

14:42.909 --> 14:44.478
I live in New York City.

14:44.479 --> 14:46.314
I know you do.

14:46.315 --> 14:48.452
We already have office space
secured on the Upper East Side.

14:48.453 --> 14:52.126
How many wealthy, well-connected
Manhattanites are suffering

14:52.127 --> 14:53.496
from sexual dysfunctions
and would be eager...

14:53.497 --> 14:56.100
Do you know where you'll be living yet?

14:56.101 --> 14:59.307
Because there are openings
in my building all the time.

14:59.308 --> 15:00.577
Best location in the city.

15:00.578 --> 15:02.514
Five-minute walk to Times Square.

15:02.515 --> 15:06.555
So... are you saying yes to the book?

15:06.556 --> 15:10.898
I'm saying I'm confident
we can work something out.

15:13.035 --> 15:16.642
In the meantime, if we could,
you know, keep this between us.

15:16.643 --> 15:18.647
Mum's the word.

15:22.087 --> 15:23.656
JOHNSON: <i>Do you have a moment?</i>

15:23.657 --> 15:26.829
I've just spoken with a
potential new client.

15:26.830 --> 15:28.064
Is that right?

15:28.065 --> 15:31.304
Yes, he and his wife are in their 60s.

15:31.305 --> 15:34.945
Evidently, their sex life has
dwindled in recent years,

15:34.946 --> 15:38.519
and he's hoping to
rekindle the lost passion.

15:38.520 --> 15:41.458
Well, they'll have to
make an appointment.

15:41.459 --> 15:42.994
There isn't an opening for months.

15:42.995 --> 15:45.800
I want to move them to
the front of the line.

15:45.801 --> 15:47.671
So these are VIPs, I gather.

15:47.672 --> 15:50.510
They're my parents.

15:50.511 --> 15:52.947
I didn't know your parents
were having trouble.

15:52.948 --> 15:55.620
Neither did I, till last week,

15:55.621 --> 15:58.659
when I ran into my father
at that singles seminar.

15:58.660 --> 16:01.230
He's dissatisfied in the marriage.

16:01.231 --> 16:03.101
According to him, my mother is no longer

16:03.102 --> 16:05.305
interested in sex at all.

16:05.306 --> 16:06.942
Mm. I have to say,

16:06.943 --> 16:08.813
I'm impressed your mother
would even entertain

16:08.814 --> 16:11.418
the idea of treatment. Seems unlike her.

16:11.419 --> 16:13.422
That's because it is unlike her.

16:13.423 --> 16:14.825
He hasn't told her a thing about it.

16:14.826 --> 16:17.029
He expects me to convince her.

16:17.030 --> 16:19.167
Uh, you said no, I hope.

16:20.269 --> 16:21.638
Oh, Virginia, you can't get

16:21.639 --> 16:23.141
in the middle of your parents' marriage.

16:23.142 --> 16:25.145
What choice do I have? They came to me.

16:25.146 --> 16:27.149
He came to you.

16:27.150 --> 16:28.519
And even if you did convince her,

16:28.520 --> 16:30.557
who's gonna take the case?
Art and Nancy?

16:32.160 --> 16:34.965
Oh, no, no. No, I can't
treat your parents.

16:34.966 --> 16:37.403
- Why not?
- Because they're your parents.

16:37.404 --> 16:39.508
My mother would never talk to strangers

16:39.509 --> 16:42.045
about the intimate details of
her marriage. You know that.

16:42.046 --> 16:43.549
And you think she'd be more comfortable

16:43.550 --> 16:45.185
sharing those details with me?

16:45.186 --> 16:48.358
Don't fight me on this, Bill, please.

16:48.359 --> 16:50.563
Help me.

16:50.564 --> 16:52.332
I can't just stand back and watch

16:52.333 --> 16:55.507
my parents' marriage fall apart.

16:59.347 --> 17:01.852
If they both agree, then...

17:01.853 --> 17:03.489
Well, I'm seeing them both tonight,

17:03.490 --> 17:04.723
so hopefully, I can find a moment

17:04.724 --> 17:07.498
to take my mother aside.

17:10.403 --> 17:13.141
You're coming over later, though, right?

17:13.142 --> 17:17.148
Uh... actually, I'm, uh...

17:17.150 --> 17:19.887
I'm concerned about a
patient, Louise Bell.

17:19.888 --> 17:21.357
She came in for treatment last week.

17:21.358 --> 17:23.529
Uh, her husband had spinal injury.

17:23.530 --> 17:27.402
Mm-hmm, well, I went to a
meeting this afternoon,

17:27.403 --> 17:32.379
and no one has seen her in days,
so I thought I would just,

17:32.380 --> 17:35.553
you know, drop by her house,
see that she's all right.

17:35.554 --> 17:38.391
Because you're still
going to AA meetings.

17:38.392 --> 17:40.863
Occasionally. I find they help.

17:40.864 --> 17:42.233
With what?

17:44.037 --> 17:47.944
No, I-I'm trying to understand.

17:47.945 --> 17:50.483
And that's exactly what
I'm doing as well,

17:50.484 --> 17:52.922
trying to understand.

You're gonna want to
sign up for that one.

18:05.346 --> 18:07.584
Well, it meets Wednesday nights,

18:22.815 --> 18:25.553
finish the drive in the morning.

18:25.554 --> 18:28.391
Just so we're clear, when
you said that Albany was

18:28.392 --> 18:31.130
"a hop, skip, and jump"
away, what you meant was

18:31.131 --> 18:34.069
a three-hour flight followed
by a six-hour drive

18:34.070 --> 18:35.740
into the middle of nowhere.

18:35.741 --> 18:38.077
For your information,
Albany is often compared

18:38.078 --> 18:40.081
to the great cities of Europe.

18:40.082 --> 18:41.486
Not favorably, but still.

18:44.290 --> 18:48.197
So, this case of yours
tomorrow, you gonna win?

18:48.198 --> 18:49.534
It doesn't matter either way.

18:49.535 --> 18:50.970
You can't mean that.

18:50.971 --> 18:53.642
Won't your client be in
trouble if you lose?

18:53.643 --> 18:55.145
It's a test case.

18:55.146 --> 18:57.282
My client intentionally set
fire to the American flag

18:57.283 --> 18:58.852
to challenge the statute.

18:58.853 --> 19:01.290
But what if the court doesn't
overturn the statute?

19:01.291 --> 19:03.962

She had sex, Doc.

She had sex, I didn't have anything.

Now, what did we decide
about New England?

20:59.060 --> 21:00.863
they are potential clients.

21:44.418 --> 21:46.254
I don't know who the father is.

21:49.060 --> 21:51.598
So it... it could be mine?

21:51.599 --> 21:55.539
Chances are just as
good that it's Bruce's,

21:55.540 --> 21:58.912
or Randy's, or... someone else's.

21:58.913 --> 22:00.716
I'm gonna speak to Barton tomorrow,

22:00.717 --> 22:03.956
ask for the name of a doctor
who can perform the procedure.

22:09.233 --> 22:11.370
Or we could keep it.

22:11.371 --> 22:12.706
Look, maybe it isn't mine.

22:12.707 --> 22:15.144
I-I'm willing to live with that chance.

22:15.145 --> 22:19.720
I don't need to look at a child
and see my... my father's ears,

22:19.721 --> 22:21.090
my grandmother's chin.

22:21.091 --> 22:22.893
What about seeing Bruce's eyes,

22:22.894 --> 22:26.166
or Randy's dimples?

22:26.167 --> 22:29.005
Hey, look, we said that
going to New York,

22:29.006 --> 22:30.542
this was our chance to start over,

22:30.543 --> 22:32.345
just the two of us. This... this is the...

22:32.346 --> 22:35.853
it's the last thread tying
us to our old life,

22:35.854 --> 22:40.061
our old marriage, our old selves.

22:40.062 --> 22:42.198
Someday soon, we will have our own,

22:42.199 --> 22:43.702
and there will not be any question,

22:43.703 --> 22:45.371
and you'll see your father's ears

22:45.372 --> 22:47.710
and... and your grandma...

22:47.711 --> 22:50.883
grandmother's chin.

22:50.884 --> 22:52.486
And that this will all
have been worth it.

22:52.487 --> 22:56.495
I-I just... I promise. Okay?

23:06.682 --> 23:08.686
Wasn't sure when you'd be coming.

23:13.395 --> 23:15.131
You smell like a tavern.

23:15.132 --> 23:16.801
I've just been to four of them.

23:16.802 --> 23:18.972
Not to drink. I was looking for Louise.

23:18.973 --> 23:21.076
HARRY: <i>Is that Bill?</i>

23:21.077 --> 23:23.982
They insisted on coming
back for a nightcap.

23:23.983 --> 23:26.421
EDNA: <i>You are joining
us, aren't you, Bill?</i>

23:26.422 --> 23:29.226
Oy.

23:29.227 --> 23:32.065
EDNA: You missed a
delicious dinner tonight.

23:32.066 --> 23:35.472
Those lamb chops, didn't they
just melt in your mouth?

23:35.473 --> 23:37.342
Mm.

23:37.343 --> 23:39.447
I still think Lisa would have done fine.

23:39.448 --> 23:41.985
Children do not belong in restaurants.

23:41.986 --> 23:44.590
I think it's a sign of the
times that so many parents

23:44.591 --> 23:48.030
don't seem to know that.
Maybe they just don't care.

23:48.031 --> 23:49.935
How are your kids, Bill?

23:51.639 --> 23:54.477
My kids? Uh, they're... they're fine.

23:54.478 --> 23:57.950
Didn't Jenny just win a
prize at camp this week?

23:57.951 --> 24:00.856
Uh, yes, yes, she...

24:00.857 --> 24:04.930
she took home the blue
ribbon in the science fair.

24:04.931 --> 24:06.734
EDNA: The science fair?

24:06.735 --> 24:10.442
Oh, looks like you have
a tomboy on your hands.

24:10.443 --> 24:14.182
Uh, Jenny made a diorama
of the moon landing.

24:14.183 --> 24:15.986
I bet she wasn't the only one.

24:15.987 --> 24:17.288
(LAUGHS) No.

24:17.289 --> 24:18.992
No, it was a very popular
theme this year.

24:18.993 --> 24:21.864
I sure there will be quite a few
Neil Armstrongs at Halloween.

24:21.865 --> 24:24.637
There was that one photo they
keep showing in the paper

24:24.638 --> 24:27.008
of the astronauts planting the flag.

24:27.009 --> 24:29.012
Yes, that was beautiful, wasn't it?

24:29.013 --> 24:30.515
HARRY: I thought it was
just about the, uh,

24:30.516 --> 24:34.022
saddest damn thing I'd ever seen.

24:34.023 --> 24:36.393
What in the world are you
talking about, Harry?

24:36.394 --> 24:40.368
Well, all around 'em, there
was nothing but black,

24:40.369 --> 24:42.372
and they were wearing those helmets too,

24:42.373 --> 24:45.412
so where their faces should have been,

24:45.413 --> 24:47.382
there's just more black,

24:47.383 --> 24:50.254
like, uh, they were lost

24:50.255 --> 24:52.926
or... invisible.

24:52.927 --> 24:54.930
Are you all right, Daddy?

24:54.931 --> 24:57.001
Harry, I think you've had
enough to drink tonight.

24:57.002 --> 24:58.739
I'm fine.

25:01.411 --> 25:04.850
It's getting late anyhow.

25:04.851 --> 25:06.954
Do you mind giving me a hand

25:06.955 --> 25:08.658
with the dishes before you go?

25:08.659 --> 25:11.063
Sure, sweetheart.

25:18.178 --> 25:20.182
(KITCHEN DOOR CLOSING)

25:23.889 --> 25:28.197
I'm sure Gini mentioned that,
uh, I came in to see her.

25:28.198 --> 25:30.201
- Uh, yes. Yes, she did.

25:30.202 --> 25:31.938
I didn't even think I was
gonna get up the nerve

25:31.939 --> 25:35.110
to ask her for help, but...

25:35.111 --> 25:38.586
just been so down in the dumps
about it, our marriage.

25:40.055 --> 25:42.960
Honest to God, Bill,
I don't know anymore

25:42.961 --> 25:45.465
whether it hurts more to stick together

25:45.466 --> 25:48.738
or hurts more to...

25:48.739 --> 25:50.743
throw in the towel.

25:58.759 --> 26:00.595
Ugh.

26:00.596 --> 26:03.568
I'm so sorry you walked into that.

26:03.569 --> 26:04.937
Didn't you speak to your mother?

26:04.938 --> 26:06.574
I tried to.

26:06.575 --> 26:09.279
I told her how concerned
I was about my father.

26:09.280 --> 26:13.086
She told me I was just being dramatic.

26:13.087 --> 26:15.559
So, what are you gonna do?

26:15.560 --> 26:17.796
I don't know. (BREATHES IN)

26:17.797 --> 26:21.805
But let's not talk about it tonight.

26:23.742 --> 26:26.647
Okay.

26:26.648 --> 26:31.658
I-I would like to talk about us, though.

26:34.464 --> 26:37.636
Exactly... what this is.

26:37.637 --> 26:40.642
I would like to talk about that too.

26:40.643 --> 26:45.251
But... first I need this.

27:43.635 --> 27:45.170
There are hippies everywhere.

27:45.171 --> 27:46.741
I thought you knew about a shortcut.

27:46.742 --> 27:48.578
This is the shortcut.

27:48.579 --> 27:49.913
Can we turn around?

27:49.914 --> 27:51.015
It's one-way.

27:56.160 --> 27:57.863
Maybe someone can tell
me what's going on.

27:57.864 --> 27:59.065
Libby, stay in the car.

27:59.066 --> 28:02.005
I'll be right back.

Hi. Excuse me, do any
of you happen to know

28:10.956 --> 28:12.626
why traffic is at a standstill?

28:12.627 --> 28:14.630
Is there some kind of accident up ahead?

28:14.631 --> 28:16.567
There are no accidents.

We're all part of the

28:19.406 --> 28:21.075

28:23.682 --> 28:25.552
Albany?

28:25.553 --> 28:28.190
- (LAUGHS) Nah, man.
- Nah.

28:28.191 --> 28:31.262
Nobody here is going to Albany.

28:31.263 --> 28:32.833
(GROANS)

28:32.834 --> 28:34.703
I mean, I knew there was
a concert happening,

28:34.704 --> 28:38.276
but the advertisements said it
was a "weekend in the country."

28:38.277 --> 28:41.382
It sounds less like a getaway and
more like the Second Coming.

peace, love, and music."

28:44.724 --> 28:46.259
Have they seen the weather forecasts?

28:46.260 --> 28:49.901
More like 72 hours of thunder,
lightning, and humidity.

28:52.440 --> 28:55.144

You guys know why they
call it The Show Me State?

you here of all places?

29:45.345 --> 29:46.747
Oh, slim, it turns out.

I don't know why she wouldn't
want to show them off.

conversation about Daddy.

31:59.680 --> 32:01.717
Oh, are you still on about that?

32:01.718 --> 32:03.487
I'm worried about him.

32:03.488 --> 32:06.760
In fact, I'm worried about both of you.

about your marriage.

I'm sorry, I must have heard you wrong.

32:14.577 --> 32:15.978
I thought you said my marriage.

32:19.286 --> 32:21.490
spark missing.

- (LAUGHS)
- And he would like you

32:22.860 --> 32:24.496
to consider treatment.

32:24.497 --> 32:26.433
Your father's lost his mind.

32:26.434 --> 32:27.702
Is he wrong?

32:27.703 --> 32:29.439
I mean, do you find yourself...

32:29.440 --> 32:32.010
sexually satisfied?

32:32.011 --> 32:33.947
Some of us are trying to eat here.

32:33.948 --> 32:35.985
I don't think that you realize

32:35.986 --> 32:40.461
how seriously Daddy
is taking this issue.

32:40.462 --> 32:43.132
If something doesn't change...

32:43.133 --> 32:46.172
I'm afraid your marriage is on the line.

32:46.173 --> 32:47.240
(SCOFFS)

32:47.241 --> 32:49.646
At least he's being honest,

32:49.647 --> 32:51.717
willing to admit that
there's a problem here,

32:51.718 --> 32:54.255
instead of just burying
his head in the sand.

32:56.259 --> 33:00.100
I guess he told you
about Colleen Goddard.

33:00.101 --> 33:04.709
Since he's being so
honest about everything.

33:04.710 --> 33:07.114
Oh.

33:07.115 --> 33:09.185
He didn't bring up Colleen.

33:12.960 --> 33:15.498
Who is that?

33:15.499 --> 33:17.835
Do you remember that dumpy dry cleaner's

33:17.836 --> 33:19.539
off Bradbury Road?

33:19.540 --> 33:22.512
Her husband owned it.
She was the tailor.

33:22.513 --> 33:24.416
For the longest time, I was worried

33:24.417 --> 33:26.420
that your father was yoyo dieting,

33:26.421 --> 33:29.659
because he was constantly
having his trousers

33:29.660 --> 33:32.732
taken in, then out.

33:32.733 --> 33:36.440
And then I found a note
she'd written him.

33:36.441 --> 33:39.244
And he didn't deny it.

33:39.245 --> 33:42.284
After that, he didn't even bother hiding

33:42.285 --> 33:43.888
what was happening anymore.

33:46.059 --> 33:48.229
He kept seeing her?

33:48.230 --> 33:49.632
For six more years.

33:49.633 --> 33:51.637
Six years?

33:53.373 --> 33:55.043
You just stayed with him?

33:55.044 --> 33:57.949
How was I supposed to
leave him with a baby?

33:57.950 --> 34:01.557
I couldn't afford to have
my child raised by sitters.

34:04.597 --> 34:06.833
We got past it.

34:06.834 --> 34:11.610
Then we had some happy years.

34:11.610 --> 34:13.746
And this is exactly why
I did not want to have

34:13.748 --> 34:15.583
this conversation with you.

34:15.585 --> 34:17.522
I can understand that
hearing this could be

34:17.523 --> 34:20.194
very upsetting to you, sweetheart.

34:23.701 --> 34:27.239
Not at all.

34:27.241 --> 34:29.478
Obviously, I feel sorry

34:29.480 --> 34:33.386
that you had to go through
such a painful experience,

34:33.387 --> 34:36.158
but I can also separate whatever...

34:36.159 --> 34:41.068
personal feelings I might have
from my clinical understanding.

34:41.069 --> 34:43.840
I have spoken to hundreds of clients

34:43.841 --> 34:45.643
with stories just like yours...

34:45.645 --> 34:49.117

keep my job with Herb,

48:15.764 --> 48:19.336
They're not small.
They're... they're... reasonable.
