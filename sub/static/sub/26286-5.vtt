00:01.535 --> 00:03.204
Previously on This Is Us...

00:03.237 --> 00:04.905
GROSS: Your father's a veteran.
He served in Vietnam.

00:04.938 --> 00:06.006
Did he see combat?

00:06.040 --> 00:07.675
I don't know.

00:07.708 --> 00:08.809
ZOE: Some of these men
have to still be alive.

00:08.842 --> 00:10.244
We can find them.

00:10.278 --> 00:11.479
See if they know
your dad's story.

00:11.512 --> 00:12.646
RANDALL:
Why doesn't somebody

00:12.680 --> 00:14.848
call the city or Parks and Rec,
fix this place up?

00:14.882 --> 00:16.584
The city doesn't care
about our problems,

00:16.617 --> 00:18.819
but if you think
you can do better,

00:18.852 --> 00:20.054
talk to Councilman Brown.

00:20.088 --> 00:21.489
If this councilman
won't do his job,

00:21.522 --> 00:22.856
then maybe I can.

00:22.890 --> 00:24.525
I think I'm gonna run
against him.

00:24.558 --> 00:27.495
I got fired today, Randall.

00:27.528 --> 00:28.929
I take medication
for depression.

00:28.962 --> 00:31.165
Without it,
life gets pretty scary.

00:31.199 --> 00:33.101
Kate's never seen me
that way, though.

00:33.134 --> 00:34.335
I hope she never has to.

00:34.368 --> 00:37.071
How you feeling?

00:37.105 --> 00:38.939
Fine. Did we get any eggs?

00:38.972 --> 00:40.708
We got eight.

00:42.143 --> 00:43.744
:
So good, you did so good.

00:46.314 --> 00:50.017
* Nobody ever loved me
like she does... *

00:50.050 --> 00:51.919
BOY: There's something very
important I forgot to tell you.

00:51.952 --> 00:54.455
Don't cross the streams.

00:54.488 --> 00:56.757
Why? Let's just say
it would be bad.

00:56.790 --> 00:58.559
What do you mean by "bad?"

00:58.592 --> 01:01.028
DAD: Well, I don't know what to
do with either of you anymore.

01:01.061 --> 01:02.763
The hysteria, the moods!

01:02.796 --> 01:04.698
MOM: Oh, I think that
I'm entitled to a little mood

01:04.732 --> 01:06.134
every now and then, don't you?

01:06.167 --> 01:07.701
Yeah, that's right,
that's right,

01:07.735 --> 01:09.803
just-just run to her house.

01:09.837 --> 01:11.472
She's all shiny and new,

01:11.505 --> 01:12.873
but before you know it
she's gonna turn real.

01:12.906 --> 01:15.276
God knows you can't handle real!

01:15.309 --> 01:17.911
* Don't let me down... *

01:17.945 --> 01:22.616
Toby, honey,
it's freezing in here.

01:22.650 --> 01:25.085
Why is your fan on?

01:26.954 --> 01:30.724
Oh, sweetie, your fingernails.

01:30.758 --> 01:33.661
Just bitten them
right down to the nubs.

01:36.096 --> 01:38.166
Everything is gonna be okay.

01:40.301 --> 01:43.103
* I'm in love
for the first time *

01:46.106 --> 01:49.843
* And I know it's gonna last *

01:51.945 --> 01:53.481
* It's a love... *

01:53.514 --> 01:56.417
Okay, little eggies.

01:56.450 --> 01:57.985
Now I know Dr. Jasper

01:58.018 --> 01:59.520
put Daddy's best swimmers
inside of you.

01:59.553 --> 02:01.422
They're gonna be
all up in your bidness,

02:01.455 --> 02:04.658
trying to get you
to fertilize, so...

02:04.692 --> 02:08.529
today we find out
if you let them.

02:08.562 --> 02:11.098
Kate, it's time.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.666
Dr. J said she'd call at 11:00.

02:12.700 --> 02:14.468
* Don't let me down... *

02:14.502 --> 02:17.137
-Okay, all right.

02:17.171 --> 02:19.507
Hello?

02:19.540 --> 02:23.311
Yes, Dr. Jasper, hi.

02:23.344 --> 02:25.679
Okay. Well, how many?

02:25.713 --> 02:28.782
So that's three chances
to get pregnant?

02:28.816 --> 02:31.118
Tobe, it's 12:01.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.120
She said she'd call
in the morning

02:33.153 --> 02:34.822
to tell us if the embryos
were viable.

02:34.855 --> 02:36.390
It's, like, officially the
afternoon, so what does it mean?

02:36.424 --> 02:38.526
What is she trying to tell us
by not telling us something?

02:38.559 --> 02:39.960
Does she not have good news? Is
that why? She's afraid to call.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.329
I don't know. She's gonna call
when she calls.

02:42.930 --> 02:44.332
-Oh, no.
-Yeah.

02:44.365 --> 02:45.533
-Oh, no, I can't do it.
-It's okay.

02:45.566 --> 02:46.534
No, I'm nervous,
I can't, I'm...

02:46.567 --> 02:47.535
-No, you go ahead.

02:47.568 --> 02:49.970
All right. Okay. Hello?

02:50.003 --> 02:54.808
Yeah, this is she, he,
yeah, it's Toby.

02:54.842 --> 03:00.648
* Don't let me down *

03:00.681 --> 03:06.086
* Don't let
me down *

03:06.119 --> 03:09.857
* Don't let me down... *

03:09.890 --> 03:14.362
* One singular sensation.

03:17.565 --> 03:19.667
One embryo, Tobe.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.235
We've got one shot.

03:21.269 --> 03:23.604
*

03:31.445 --> 03:33.747
Is anyone gonna fix
this friggin' thing?

03:33.781 --> 03:35.349
The cable bill.

03:35.383 --> 03:37.251
Thank you. Yes, Kev,
I will call the super again.

03:37.285 --> 03:39.887
"Well, that's quite all right,
Mrs. Sycamore."

03:39.920 --> 03:41.522
REBECCA:
What's that, hon?

03:41.555 --> 03:42.923
It's a line
from the school play he's in.

03:42.956 --> 03:44.692
-You Can't Take It with You.
-Oh.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.059
Hey, can you take it with you
into the shower, Kev?

03:46.093 --> 03:47.361
We're gonna be late
for the prom.

03:47.395 --> 03:48.862
Prom's not for three hours,
Randall.

03:48.896 --> 03:50.698
Which is about how long
it takes you to do your hair.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.433
-And I exit.

03:52.466 --> 03:55.202
Are the girls gonna come here
to take their pictures?

03:55.235 --> 03:57.237
We're going to take pictures
at Allison's, actually.

03:57.271 --> 03:59.139
Apparently her dad's obsessed
with documenting

03:59.172 --> 04:01.442
every single moment
of her life, so...

04:01.475 --> 04:04.412
All right.

04:04.445 --> 04:08.115
Well, I'll be sure
to get lots of copies then.

04:08.148 --> 04:12.019
Yeah, well, have fun, dude.
Live large.

04:15.589 --> 04:16.957
I already asked.

04:16.990 --> 04:18.492
She said she doesn't want
to come with us. Just leave it.

04:20.461 --> 04:24.432
Now I got to go turn myself
from Urkel to Stefan.

04:29.002 --> 04:29.970
-Hey, question.
-Hey.

04:30.003 --> 04:31.405
You first.

04:31.439 --> 04:34.274
Okay. Hoop earrings.
"Hey, how you doing?"

04:34.308 --> 04:38.746
Or power necklace.
"What's up?"

04:38.779 --> 04:40.581
I like them hoochie hoops.

04:40.614 --> 04:42.483
"Hoochie?" Okay, necklace.

04:42.516 --> 04:44.485
You ready to crush
this interview?

04:44.518 --> 04:46.654
I am coming home
with no less than

04:46.687 --> 04:48.255
-a six-figure offer.
-Mm-hmm.

04:48.288 --> 04:51.158
I spoke with the CEO on
the phone for an hour yesterday.

04:51.191 --> 04:52.593
-Yes, ma'am.
-Meeting with
department heads today.

04:52.626 --> 04:55.429
Okay? Not gonna jinx it.

04:55.463 --> 04:57.465
-You go.
-Um, let's see.

04:57.498 --> 05:00.267
Tie, right

05:00.300 --> 05:03.103
Uh, tie's too formal
and you should show some neck.

05:03.136 --> 05:05.673
What do you mean,
like, like this?

05:05.706 --> 05:08.008
Mm-hmm. Oh, God.

05:08.041 --> 05:10.678
-It's the first official day
of my campaign.

05:10.711 --> 05:12.813
I'm doing it, Beth. Uh-huh.

05:12.846 --> 05:15.282
Running for city council
of Philadelphia's 12th district.

05:15.315 --> 05:18.118
Am I a resident there? No.

05:18.151 --> 05:19.653
But am I technically
allowed to run

05:19.687 --> 05:21.221
because I put my name
on William's lease

05:21.254 --> 05:23.290
when he moved in with us?
You damn skippy.

05:23.323 --> 05:25.192
You damn skippy.

05:25.225 --> 05:26.894
I'm having my first meet
and greet in a down-home joint

05:26.927 --> 05:28.529
my birth father
probably knew and loved

05:28.562 --> 05:32.900
in the city where he lived...

05:32.933 --> 05:35.703
You cannot cry
on the campaign trail.

05:35.736 --> 05:38.138
-I'm not gonna.
-No, you're an emotional man,
Randall.

05:38.171 --> 05:39.507
You talk about fathers, you cry.

05:39.540 --> 05:40.741
You talk about daughters,
you cry.

05:40.774 --> 05:42.510
Okay, you talk about the little
round boy on the corner

05:42.543 --> 05:44.311
who tried to sell lemonade
in the winter...

05:44.344 --> 05:45.979
All his lemonade froze, Beth.

05:46.013 --> 05:47.815
Yeah, well he was stupid, baby.

05:47.848 --> 05:52.219
Now look, you have a big open
heart and I love that about you,

05:52.252 --> 05:54.588
okay, but these people
do not want to see

05:54.622 --> 05:55.689
a rich man from Alpine

05:55.723 --> 05:57.691
crying when he talks to them.

05:57.725 --> 05:58.992
Understood.

05:59.026 --> 06:01.328
Yeah. All right.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.030
I'll get there as soon as I can.

06:03.063 --> 06:05.232
Hey, remember what we said.

06:05.265 --> 06:07.835
If after five minutes,
five days, five weeks,

06:07.868 --> 06:09.870
if you're not feeling this,
I drop out.

06:09.903 --> 06:12.773
Knock them dead, Councilman.

06:12.806 --> 06:14.708
You take no prisoners, baby.

06:14.742 --> 06:19.079
Go on now, go on now. Mm!

06:22.416 --> 06:24.852
Is this crazy, huh?

06:24.885 --> 06:26.286
Driving all the way to Baltimore

06:26.319 --> 06:28.121
to meet some dude
that my dad served with?

06:28.155 --> 06:30.223
I mean, this guy, Robinson,
right, he's a complete unknown.

06:30.257 --> 06:32.359
So how do I introduce you,
anyway?

06:32.392 --> 06:33.961
Documentarian girlfriend,
does that work?

06:33.994 --> 06:36.730
You introduce me as Zoe,
human being,

06:36.764 --> 06:42.035
who is a documentarian
who you happen to be dating.

06:42.069 --> 06:45.473
It's kind of a mouthful,
but we'll go with it.

06:45.506 --> 06:48.909
Oh, damn.
I forgot my silk pillowcase.

06:48.942 --> 06:50.578
No, you didn't. Really?

06:50.611 --> 06:52.780
Well,
turn it around, you know,

06:52.813 --> 06:55.115
because Zoe Baker cannot sleep
on cheap hotel bedding.

06:55.148 --> 07:00.053
No.  No, that's, uh...

07:00.087 --> 07:04.224
Forget it.
Baltimore, baby.

07:04.257 --> 07:05.959
Baltimore, baby.

07:08.428 --> 07:10.030
Here's to you, Mr. Robinson.

07:17.104 --> 07:19.106
I am really too tired
for this today.

07:19.139 --> 07:22.009
Mom, you're constantly in bed.

07:22.042 --> 07:24.478
I need new school clothes.

07:24.512 --> 07:27.114
-Shh. It's okay, it's okay.

07:27.147 --> 07:30.317
Please, don't cry.
Please, please.

07:30.350 --> 07:33.186
: Can't I just have
one damn day?

07:33.220 --> 07:36.289
Please, stop crying.

07:36.323 --> 07:40.027
Toby, you don't need a blazer.

07:40.060 --> 07:42.596
Yeah, I do. Look.

07:42.630 --> 07:46.033
"'Cause I don't get no respect.
No respect at all."

07:46.066 --> 07:50.437
Are-are you doing
Rodney Dangerfield?

07:50.470 --> 07:52.706
Dad lets me watch Johnny Carson.

07:52.740 --> 07:56.644
"Me and my wife were happy
for 20 years. Then we met."

07:59.980 --> 08:01.749
Oh, Toby.

08:05.085 --> 08:08.455
Oh, Toby.

08:08.488 --> 08:13.026
Come on. Let's see if we can
find you some shirts.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.369
Hi.

08:22.402 --> 08:24.304
Hey, there's my maybe-mama.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.874
Morning maybe-daddy.

08:26.907 --> 08:28.809
Okay, I don't want to jinx us,
but I think I'm pregnant.

08:28.842 --> 08:31.712
-The test results are
coming back today.

08:31.745 --> 08:33.881
I'm going with pregnant.
What do you think?

08:33.914 --> 08:35.883
Today is nothing but good news.

08:35.916 --> 08:37.718
What time is the doctor supposed
to call with the results?

08:37.751 --> 08:38.719
-4:00.

08:38.752 --> 08:40.187
-4:00.
-Yeah.

08:40.220 --> 08:41.589
Right. So here's
what we're gonna do.

08:41.622 --> 08:43.323
We are gonna
keep ourselves busy.

08:43.356 --> 08:44.858
I'm gonna go to work,
you're gonna go to work

08:44.892 --> 08:48.228
and nobody is gonna take
a home pregnancy test.

08:48.261 --> 08:50.397
Okay.

08:50.430 --> 08:52.399
-Kate, say why.
-Okay.

08:52.432 --> 08:54.768
Because at this stage
it's just not accurate

08:54.802 --> 08:56.503
and it causes emotional chaos.

08:56.536 --> 08:59.039
-We want...

08:59.072 --> 09:01.374
-calm.
-Calm.

09:01.408 --> 09:03.510
All right, see you soon.

09:03.543 --> 09:04.678
I can't wait eight hours.

09:04.712 --> 09:06.513
You'll pass the time easy.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.048
It'll take you at least two
hours to get ready for your gig.

09:08.081 --> 09:10.550
Well, three if I do my nails
before my lashes.

09:10.584 --> 09:12.085
Yeah, the gigs will get better.

09:12.119 --> 09:14.287
All right,
we meet back here at 4:00

09:14.321 --> 09:15.522
to get the results together.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.290
Okay.

09:17.324 --> 09:19.126
-Okay.
-Hey, babe.

09:19.159 --> 09:20.193
Yeah

09:20.227 --> 09:22.229
Thanks for being my rock.

09:22.262 --> 09:24.665
Always.

09:31.338 --> 09:33.540
-Surprise!
Miguel.

09:33.573 --> 09:36.476
Yeah, I was driving by a-a yard
sale and-and there it was.

09:36.509 --> 09:38.779
I know that your old piano used
to be the center of your house,

09:38.812 --> 09:40.547
so I thought that maybe
you all could use something

09:40.580 --> 09:42.049
that says home.

09:42.082 --> 09:45.118
Yeah, or-or we can take it away.

09:45.152 --> 09:47.921
I mean, two of us'll probably
drop dead, but we could...

09:47.955 --> 09:49.890
No, no, no.
Come on in, of course.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.291
-I'm just so surprised.
-Great, okay.

09:51.324 --> 09:52.492
-All right, come on, guys.
-Just... ah.

09:52.525 --> 09:53.894
Help me swing it around
this way.

09:53.927 --> 09:57.631
Great, now this place
is smaller.

10:00.801 --> 10:02.770
-Still.

10:02.803 --> 10:04.104
Let me
take a look at it.

10:04.137 --> 10:06.039
Thank you.
-Yeah.

10:08.041 --> 10:11.344
Oh, my goodness. Wow.

10:13.781 --> 10:15.916
-Hmm.

10:15.949 --> 10:17.584
KEVIN:
No girlfriend.

10:17.617 --> 10:19.853
-No.
-No. Okay, how about,
how about friends

10:19.887 --> 10:22.089
with mind-blowing benefits
that are close enough

10:22.122 --> 10:23.924
to share some questionable
beef jerky at a gas station

10:23.957 --> 10:25.292
while on a road trip together?

10:25.325 --> 10:27.027
-I'm gonna hit the ladies' room.
-Okay.

10:27.060 --> 10:28.461
-Okay.
-Yep.

10:28.495 --> 10:29.830
-Thank you.
-See you in a bit.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.199
Pardon me.

10:32.232 --> 10:34.201
-All right.

10:34.234 --> 10:36.336
-Good. Good...
-Good.

10:36.369 --> 10:38.806
And... you got no Hi

10:38.839 --> 10:40.607
-No.
-Ugh!

10:40.640 --> 10:42.943
Perfect.
-Bathroom was out of order.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.144
Hang on, ma'am,
I'll be right with you.

10:44.177 --> 10:46.313
KEVIN:
Oh, no, we're together.

10:46.346 --> 10:48.949
Yeah, take those.
And then, do you like, um...

10:48.982 --> 10:50.951
do you like generic Twizzlers?

10:50.984 --> 10:53.320
Harder to digest,
the more I like them.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.992
RANDALL:
All right, people. Our goal

10:59.026 --> 11:01.361
is to have a lot of Pearson
signs leaving this place today,

11:01.394 --> 11:03.663
along with a lot
of changed minds. Yeah?

11:03.697 --> 11:05.098
Where are the owners?
Owners here?

11:07.034 --> 11:09.903
Hello. How you doing, sir?

11:09.937 --> 11:11.972
-Honored to meet you, sir.
-Yeah.

11:12.005 --> 11:14.808
-Albert Jones, my wife Doris.

11:14.842 --> 11:17.177
I can't thank you all enough
for hosting today.

11:17.210 --> 11:19.246
Fixtures of the neighborhood
like yourselves

11:19.279 --> 11:21.882
supporting change, it's more
meaningful than you know.

11:21.915 --> 11:24.484
What we support
is you paying up-front.

11:24.517 --> 11:27.387
Oh, yes, ma'am. I can, uh,
got my checkbook right here.

11:27.420 --> 11:28.822
DORIS:
Mm-hmm.

11:28.856 --> 11:31.024
RANDALL:
You guys enjoying yourselves?

11:31.058 --> 11:32.993
Randall Pearson,
nice to meet you.

11:33.026 --> 11:36.529
Let me know if I can
do anything for you. Okay.

11:36.563 --> 11:38.665
Enjoying the food? Right on.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.667
How you doing, ma'am?
Randall Pearson.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.669
-No ma'am, Pearson.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.772
I'm running for councilman
for the 12th District.

11:44.805 --> 11:47.707
Oh, I don't know nothing about
that. You in line for food?

11:47.741 --> 11:49.676
No, ma'am, I didn't mean
to interrupt you.

11:49.709 --> 11:52.679
You go right ahead. Oh, man.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.915
Hey, how you doing, big man?
Randall Pearson. You are?

11:54.948 --> 11:56.216
Hungry as a horse. Smells good.

11:56.249 --> 11:59.152
Right on. Hope you enjoy.

12:02.422 --> 12:04.424
-Hey, ChiChi.

12:04.457 --> 12:08.628
Take a look at this flyer,
and tell me, where is my name?

12:08.661 --> 12:11.531
Right... there.

12:11.564 --> 12:14.935
In the fine print,
like a pharmaceutical warning.

12:14.968 --> 12:17.237
-You asked me to fill the place.

12:17.270 --> 12:21.374
I filled the place.
The rest is up to you.

12:21.408 --> 12:24.912
* You just want
somebody new... *

12:34.087 --> 12:35.956
ALAN: For God's sakes, Toby,
don't start.

12:35.989 --> 12:37.991
This has been coming
for a long time.

12:38.025 --> 12:39.993
-You'll spend
the weekends with me.

12:40.027 --> 12:43.096
I know, Dad. I'm fine.

12:43.130 --> 12:46.066
You're a good kid, Toby.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.968
But there's so much
of her in you,

12:48.001 --> 12:49.602
it scares the hell out of me.

12:49.636 --> 12:51.438
This sad-sack thing
that comes over you,

12:51.471 --> 12:54.674
you better find a way
to get a handle on it.

12:54.707 --> 13:00.180
Because this crap simply
will not fly when you're grown.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.820
-Hi, hi.

13:06.854 --> 13:10.590
Yeah, uh, look, it-it's,
this is a funny story.

13:10.623 --> 13:14.127
I-I did-- I did something
a little...

13:14.161 --> 13:17.364
My, uh, my wife was having a
hell of a time getting pregnant,

13:17.397 --> 13:20.633
and our-our doctor said
that my antidepressants

13:20.667 --> 13:22.202
were killing my sperm.

13:22.235 --> 13:24.004
She also said that the IVF
we were gonna do had,

13:24.037 --> 13:27.875
like, a 90% chance of failing,
and my guys needed to be strong

13:27.908 --> 13:29.609
in case we had
to try again naturally.

13:29.642 --> 13:31.879
-Mm, sir, I don't think
we can help you...
-So,

13:31.912 --> 13:35.515
so, uh, I-I went off my meds,
and today, I find out

13:35.548 --> 13:37.817
if I can go back on them,
and if I can go back on them,

13:37.851 --> 13:39.786
then I need to go back on them,
like, right away, right now.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.321
Toot sweet,
you know what I mean?

13:41.354 --> 13:43.623
You need to go back
on your meds properly.

13:43.656 --> 13:46.226
Call your doctor, sir, today.

13:46.259 --> 13:48.461
Is there someone
that can pick you up?

13:48.495 --> 13:50.297
Uh...

13:50.330 --> 13:54.501
Well, yeah, uh, no,
she can't know. She can't know.

13:54.534 --> 13:56.436
*

14:02.209 --> 14:04.811
I'm the singing Adele-o-gram.

14:04.844 --> 14:07.680
Uh, I was booked
for a birthday party.

14:07.714 --> 14:09.883
Oh, right.
Uh, he'll be right out.

14:09.917 --> 14:12.152
-Thank you.

14:12.185 --> 14:14.554
Oh, my God.

14:14.587 --> 14:16.389
Amaze.

14:16.423 --> 14:17.590
-Oh.

14:17.624 --> 14:19.392
-Yeah. Hi.
-I'm John.

14:19.426 --> 14:20.727
So, everyone's waiting
in the conf.

14:20.760 --> 14:23.196
This is gonna be so epic.

14:23.230 --> 14:24.898
Ooh, so epic.

14:24.932 --> 14:27.734
Okay.

14:27.767 --> 14:29.436
What's up with you, tweaker?

14:29.469 --> 14:30.537
It's my first time meeting
Allison's parents.

14:30.570 --> 14:32.105
Oh, y-you're good, man.

14:32.139 --> 14:33.840
You're a parents' dream:
straight As,

14:33.873 --> 14:35.842
good manners,
no idea how to have sex.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.878
Shut up.
You look like a bellhop.

14:38.912 --> 14:41.381
Well, how nice everyone looks.

14:41.414 --> 14:43.683
H-Hi, Mrs. Walsh.
Uh, I'm Randall.

14:43.716 --> 14:46.419
And this is Kevin, my brother.
And that's Sophie.

14:46.453 --> 14:47.787
Well, come in.

14:50.123 --> 14:51.858
Randall, give me a hug.

14:54.061 --> 14:55.728
It's so good
to finally meet you.

14:55.762 --> 14:58.665
Allison, they're here!

15:02.135 --> 15:04.104
Wow.

15:04.137 --> 15:06.273
Y-You look amazing.

15:06.306 --> 15:08.541
So do you.

15:08.575 --> 15:09.742
Thanks.

15:09.776 --> 15:11.811
-Yeah.

15:15.782 --> 15:19.219
Hello there, Randall.

15:19.252 --> 15:21.588
I've heard so much a...

15:28.761 --> 15:31.731
I'm sorry, I can't do this.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.666
ALLISON:
Dad!

15:35.602 --> 15:37.837
Randall, I'm so sorry.

15:42.675 --> 15:44.744
I'm Randall Pearson,
and I'm running for councilman

15:44.777 --> 15:48.448
for the 12th District.

15:48.481 --> 15:51.251
All right.

15:51.284 --> 15:54.154
Say, can, um... can we get
a round of applause

15:54.187 --> 15:56.156
for Doris and Al's hospitality,

15:56.189 --> 15:58.158
and the best damn ribs
I've ever had?

15:58.191 --> 16:00.293
-All right.

16:00.327 --> 16:01.694
Thank you all very much.

16:01.728 --> 16:04.331
Now, um, they've made it
very clear to me

16:04.364 --> 16:06.599
that while they may be
hosting today,

16:06.633 --> 16:08.301
I have not won their support.

16:08.335 --> 16:10.137
Not yet. And that's fine.

16:10.170 --> 16:11.938
I get it. I do.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.340
'Cause, uh, most of y'all
are probably wondering

16:13.373 --> 16:14.874
who the hell I am,
all of a sudden, right?.

16:14.907 --> 16:16.109
-Yeah...

16:16.143 --> 16:17.710
RANDALL:
Okay, I got a laugh.

16:17.744 --> 16:19.779
I like that, keep them coming.

16:19.812 --> 16:20.947
:
Hey.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.815
For the last decade,

16:22.849 --> 16:26.153
I've been living in Alpine,
New Jersey, raising a family.

16:26.186 --> 16:30.157
But my father William lived six
blocks from here for 20 years.

16:30.190 --> 16:32.625
And he cared for the people
in his building.

16:32.659 --> 16:34.327
He fought
for their quality of life

16:34.361 --> 16:37.030
by speaking up
to management, often.

16:37.064 --> 16:38.531
Was kind of like
that, uh, mosquito

16:38.565 --> 16:40.500
in your ear
you can never quite catch?

16:40.533 --> 16:42.135
Another laugh.

16:42.169 --> 16:43.536
That's cool.

16:43.570 --> 16:47.640
Anyway, um, when he died,

16:47.674 --> 16:50.710
my wife Beth and I-- hey, wife--

16:50.743 --> 16:52.345
we decided to take up
his mantle,

16:52.379 --> 16:54.881
and we bought the building
and I became a landlord.

16:54.914 --> 16:56.883
And I fixed what was broken
as fast as I could.

16:56.916 --> 17:00.720
And then I saw the neighborhood:
the broken streetlights,

17:00.753 --> 17:03.356
the rising crime, and I decided
I wanted to fix that, too.

17:03.390 --> 17:05.425
Thought this wasn't
gonna be a speech.

17:05.458 --> 17:07.494
-Yeah.
-Right.
-RANDALL: You're right,
you're right.

17:07.527 --> 17:10.063
Get to the point, Pearson. Okay.

17:10.097 --> 17:12.065
Um...

17:12.099 --> 17:14.667
You all have been
under the same leadership

17:14.701 --> 17:17.704
for-for a very long time
with a man that many of you

17:17.737 --> 17:19.572
-think of as a friend.
-Hea friend.

17:19.606 --> 17:21.774
-Been a friend for 30 years.
-Yes, ma'am.

17:21.808 --> 17:23.376
-I know that you are...
-I don't know
what you're talking about.

17:23.410 --> 17:25.412
I know you're comfortable
with Sol Brown. Right?

17:25.445 --> 17:27.247
-Yeah.
-So comfortable,

17:27.280 --> 17:28.681
that when he lets you down,

17:28.715 --> 17:30.250
you may be willing
to look the other way.

17:30.283 --> 17:31.851
-MAN: Go home!

17:31.884 --> 17:33.052
-WOMAN: Yeah!
-Okay.

17:33.086 --> 17:35.888
You are not from here, honey.

17:35.922 --> 17:37.557
Listen, 33% of your businesses

17:37.590 --> 17:39.592
have been boarded up
in the last ten years.

17:39.626 --> 17:42.962
40% of your children don't have
a place to go after school.

17:42.995 --> 17:46.466
Kids are walking home in the
dark, they're getting hurt.

17:46.499 --> 17:49.769
Please. Ma'am, will you just
take a poster on your way out?

17:49.802 --> 17:53.206
: And I'd really love
to hear your concerns...

17:53.240 --> 17:56.609
*

17:56.643 --> 18:01.548
KATE: * Everybody loves
the things you do *

18:01.581 --> 18:04.751
* From the way you talk

18:04.784 --> 18:07.554
* To the way you move...

18:07.587 --> 18:09.422
Hey, Dr. Weiss, it's Toby Damon.

18:09.456 --> 18:11.057
I know I've missed
a couple of sessions,

18:11.090 --> 18:12.592
but if you can give me
a call back right away,

18:12.625 --> 18:13.926
that'd be great. Thanks. Bye.

18:13.960 --> 18:15.762
* Everybody here
is watching you *

18:15.795 --> 18:18.665
* 'Cause you feel like home *

18:18.698 --> 18:21.801
* You're like a dream
come true *

18:21.834 --> 18:27.307
* But if by chance
you're here alone *

18:27.340 --> 18:32.145
* Can I have a moment

18:32.179 --> 18:34.847
* Before I go?

18:34.881 --> 18:37.184
Miguel, I'm so sorry.

18:37.217 --> 18:38.918
I-I've almost got it, I swear.

18:38.951 --> 18:40.953
Honestly, you don't
have to fix our fridge.

18:40.987 --> 18:44.757
No, I... I do. I do, Rebecca.

18:44.791 --> 18:47.026
* I used to know

18:47.059 --> 18:50.163
* You look like a movie

18:50.197 --> 18:53.333
* You sound like a song

18:53.366 --> 18:57.470
* My God, this reminds me

18:57.504 --> 19:01.107
* Of when we were young

19:01.140 --> 19:04.444
* Let me photograph you
in this light *

19:04.477 --> 19:07.647
* In case it is the last time

19:07.680 --> 19:12.352
* That we might be exactly
like we were *

19:12.385 --> 19:14.454
* Before we realized

19:14.487 --> 19:15.655
* We were scared...

19:15.688 --> 19:19.292
So you're Jack Pearson's son.

19:19.326 --> 19:22.662
* It was just like a movie

19:22.695 --> 19:26.966
* It was just like a song

19:26.999 --> 19:30.069
* When we were young.

19:41.748 --> 19:44.317
TOBY:
Josie, don't go.

19:44.351 --> 19:45.318
I'm going through a rough patch.

19:45.352 --> 19:46.653
If...

19:46.686 --> 19:49.356
All you do is play your Xbox
for hours on end online.

19:49.389 --> 19:51.157
Hey, hey, hey. Hey, look.
I'll-I'll get,

19:51.190 --> 19:53.993
-I'll get back on the meds.
-Look, we gave it a shot.

19:54.026 --> 19:57.730
Okay? Maybe it's just
not meant to be, with us.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.503
Hey, can I ask you something?

20:03.536 --> 20:05.171
What the hell
are you doing here?

20:05.204 --> 20:07.274
Right now, I'm waiting
for the elevator.

20:07.307 --> 20:09.276
I have to be home at 4:00.

20:09.309 --> 20:12.279
No, I'm saying you're, like,
seriously talented.

20:12.312 --> 20:14.381
Like, you should be
on The Voice.

20:14.414 --> 20:16.716
Yeah. Yeah, well.

20:16.749 --> 20:18.918
Yeah, no, this pays the bills.

20:18.951 --> 20:20.420
It pays the gas bill.

20:20.453 --> 20:22.689
Let's be honest,
it pays half the gas bill.

20:22.722 --> 20:26.393
Well, you're amazing.

20:26.426 --> 20:29.262
-So...
-Here's the thing.

20:31.764 --> 20:35.435
When sad things happen to me,

20:35.468 --> 20:38.638
I tend to shut music
out of my life.

20:38.671 --> 20:40.807
A lot of sad things have
happened to me,

20:40.840 --> 20:45.445
which is why I'm nearly 40,
singing Adele-o-grams.

20:45.478 --> 20:47.614
Fits and starts, right?

20:49.516 --> 20:52.084
Well, I hope
things stay happy, then.

20:52.118 --> 20:54.020
Me, too.

21:16.709 --> 21:19.078
* Head and in

21:19.111 --> 21:21.648
* To my heart

21:21.681 --> 21:24.451
* Gonna find

21:24.484 --> 21:26.386
* The strength...

21:56.015 --> 21:59.786
And, uh,
this one is a Purple Heart,

21:59.819 --> 22:01.287
which I got in exchange

22:01.320 --> 22:05.492
-Oh, wow.

22:05.525 --> 22:07.427
Yeah. Your father...

22:10.062 --> 22:14.701
You want to join me
in a nip of bourbon, son?

22:14.734 --> 22:17.570
Um... I would love to,
but I can't, I'm sober.

22:17.604 --> 22:21.240
-Oh. Well, good for you.
-Thank you.

22:21.273 --> 22:25.712
Yeah. My, uh,

22:25.745 --> 22:28.848
my dad suffered as well
with alcohol, so...

22:28.881 --> 22:30.850
-Huh.
-Yeah. I was, I was thinking,

22:30.883 --> 22:35.254
um, maybe it had something
to do with the war, you know?

22:35.287 --> 22:38.725
His way of coping with what
he'd seen over there.

22:38.758 --> 22:41.127
As a mechanic.

22:47.400 --> 22:51.904
How deep you want
to go here, son?

22:51.938 --> 22:55.174
Well, I'm here, right?

22:55.207 --> 22:58.578
Your father was not a mechanic.

22:58.611 --> 23:03.416
He was a Staff Sergeant
with Alpha Company's 3rd Squad.

23:03.450 --> 23:06.352
Uh, squad leader, in fact.

23:06.385 --> 23:10.523
And in October 1971,

23:10.557 --> 23:13.292
your dad saved my life.

23:19.065 --> 23:22.234
You two make an adorable couple.

23:22.268 --> 23:24.637
-Oh, we're not serious.

23:24.671 --> 23:28.875
So you just casually
went on a long road trip

23:28.908 --> 23:30.910
to track down
his father's war buddy?

23:30.943 --> 23:35.047
I have some hang-ups with men.

23:35.081 --> 23:37.283
And he's the first
pure alabaster one

23:37.316 --> 23:38.718
I've dated seriously,

23:38.751 --> 23:41.387
-so... Yeah.
-Ah.

23:41.420 --> 23:44.390
Today at the gas station,

23:44.423 --> 23:47.660
the cashier didn't realize
we were together,

23:47.694 --> 23:50.597
and, um, she was rude to me.

23:50.630 --> 23:52.899
Not in the obvious way,
just, uh...

23:52.932 --> 23:54.100
I got it.

23:54.133 --> 23:56.435
Mm, and, Kevin, he was...

23:56.469 --> 23:57.837
He didn't get it?

23:57.870 --> 24:00.507
He didn't even see it.

24:00.540 --> 24:03.275
And it's the little things,
you know, like, this morning,

24:03.309 --> 24:05.444
I forgot my pillowcase

24:05.478 --> 24:08.447
and I realized he thinks I sleep
with a special pillowcase

24:08.481 --> 24:10.517
because I'm fancy.

24:10.550 --> 24:12.251
:
Oh, Lord.

24:12.284 --> 24:14.153
-No.

24:14.186 --> 24:16.489
When I start explaining
that I need a silk pillowcase

24:16.523 --> 24:19.125
for my hair,
then where does it end?

24:19.158 --> 24:21.193
There's always gonna
be something, right?

24:21.227 --> 24:23.029
And do I really want
to spend my time

24:23.062 --> 24:24.997
trying to explain
what it's like to be black

24:25.031 --> 24:27.634
to a white movie star?

24:27.667 --> 24:29.268
Sounds exhausting.

24:29.301 --> 24:32.605
Little bit.

24:32.639 --> 24:35.808
Well, it seems to me,

24:35.842 --> 24:38.878
you need to decide
what you can handle.

24:38.911 --> 24:41.447
And if he's worth it to you.

24:41.480 --> 24:44.717
Hm.

24:44.751 --> 24:47.353
Let's get to this key lime pie.

24:52.058 --> 24:55.628
Well, that was
an unmitigated disaster.

24:55.662 --> 24:58.064
Five people stayed behind
to talk to you.

24:58.097 --> 25:00.232
They work here, Beth.

25:00.266 --> 25:02.669
-Oh.
-I don't get it, babe.

25:02.702 --> 25:05.004
Every day I hear a new complaint

25:05.037 --> 25:07.039
about quality of life
in this district,

25:07.073 --> 25:09.976
and in the next breath they say,
"I'm voting for Sol Brown."

25:10.009 --> 25:11.377
What's that supposed to tell me?

25:11.410 --> 25:12.812
ALBERT:
Go back where you belong.

25:12.845 --> 25:15.347
What's that, now?

25:15.381 --> 25:17.483
-I'm sorry, I didn't catch that.
-BETH: Hey, babe.

25:17.516 --> 25:19.986
I said go back where you belong.

25:20.019 --> 25:24.591
Hmm. Where I belong, huh?

25:24.624 --> 25:27.594
And where exactly
is that, Mr. Jones?

25:27.627 --> 25:29.596
Oh, please, you tell me

25:29.629 --> 25:31.831
because you would be answering
the great mystery of my life,

25:31.864 --> 25:33.199
I tell you that.

25:35.367 --> 25:37.169
Look, all due respect, sir,

25:37.203 --> 25:38.771
this is a community
of good people

25:38.805 --> 25:40.607
who have been totally abandoned,

25:40.640 --> 25:42.675
and I can't fathom why
they're not furious about it.

25:42.709 --> 25:45.511
Because they know the man
who's failing them?

25:45.544 --> 25:48.447
When did complacency
become the best option here?

25:48.480 --> 25:51.117
Blind loyalty the better way?

25:51.150 --> 25:53.285
Man, get the hell on
out of my restaurant.

25:53.319 --> 25:54.621
DORIS:
Albert, come on, now.

25:54.654 --> 25:56.255
Who do you think you are,
coming down here

25:56.288 --> 25:58.257
and wagging your finger
in our faces?

25:58.290 --> 25:59.959
In 2003,

25:59.992 --> 26:02.929
after owning this place
for 21 years,

26:02.962 --> 26:05.131
working our fingers to the bone,

26:05.164 --> 26:08.534
new landlord comes strolling up
in here with his white collar

26:08.567 --> 26:12.071
and his white agenda
to move black folks out.

26:12.104 --> 26:15.775
He raises the rent by a half,
and just like that we were done.

26:17.343 --> 26:18.978
Doris sat down on the floor
right there

26:19.011 --> 26:21.614
where you're standing,
and she sobbed.

26:21.648 --> 26:23.983
New councilman heard our story,

26:24.016 --> 26:27.720
a skinny young cat
named Sol Brown.

26:27.754 --> 26:31.323
He took the landlord
to a Phillies game.

26:31.357 --> 26:34.093
Something was decided, I don't
know what, and I don't...

26:34.126 --> 26:37.129
I don't much care,
'cause the next day

26:37.163 --> 26:39.265
the landlord
came back up in here,

26:39.298 --> 26:41.333
raised the rent
a reasonable rate,

26:41.367 --> 26:44.136
sat down,
we broke bread together,

26:44.170 --> 26:47.573
and 15 years later,
we still here.

26:47.606 --> 26:49.341
:
So, no.

26:49.375 --> 26:52.144
We don't owe Sol Brown
our loyalty.

26:55.381 --> 26:59.518
We owe him our lives.

27:01.721 --> 27:05.357
Am I clear?

27:05.391 --> 27:06.558
Yes, sir.

27:18.404 --> 27:21.507
Sweetie, uh, your brother

27:21.540 --> 27:25.044
is-is really worried about you.

27:25.077 --> 27:27.179
He-he said that you
talked on the phone

27:27.213 --> 27:29.481
and that you said
some pretty scary things.

27:29.515 --> 27:32.051
Have you been outside at all?

27:36.555 --> 27:38.624
Toby, Josie's been gone
for months.

27:38.657 --> 27:42.361
-Y-You really need to get up.
-I can't.

27:42.394 --> 27:46.165
Yes, you can. I did.

27:46.198 --> 27:51.003
With the help of a ten-year-old
boy who did impressions.

27:53.706 --> 27:57.176
Listen to me, the joy in you

27:57.209 --> 27:59.846
is as much a part of you
as this sadness.

27:59.879 --> 28:03.315
Do you hear me?

28:03.349 --> 28:05.217
I do think the medication

28:05.251 --> 28:07.086
and our sessions
are having an effect, Toby.

28:07.119 --> 28:09.255
I concur, Doc Feelgood.

28:09.288 --> 28:11.557
Now, if we could only find
somebody who wanted to date

28:11.590 --> 28:14.226
a guy who looks like
he swallowed the Unabomber.

28:14.260 --> 28:18.130
Is that something
that you'd like to attack?

28:20.266 --> 28:22.268
WOMAN:
And so I said to myself,

28:22.301 --> 28:24.203
"Tanya,
you have lost the weight,

28:24.236 --> 28:26.773
"and now you can help others

28:26.806 --> 28:28.941
be skinny like you."

28:28.975 --> 28:32.344
Oh, thank you, guys. Thank you.

28:32.378 --> 28:34.113
So, who would like
to share first?

28:34.146 --> 28:36.749
Come on. Come on,
come on, come on.

28:36.783 --> 28:38.084
WOMAN:
Seriously, man?

28:38.117 --> 28:39.585
You've been hogging this
for a hour.

28:39.618 --> 28:41.954
What are you even talking about?
What time is it?

28:41.988 --> 28:44.857
3:45.

28:44.891 --> 28:49.128
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

28:49.161 --> 28:50.963
KEVIN: So, you're saying
my old man was in charge

28:50.997 --> 28:52.464
-ROBINSON: Yep.

28:52.498 --> 28:53.900
-And they all loved him.
-All right.

28:53.933 --> 28:55.902
-That sounds about right.

28:55.935 --> 28:57.703
Man. You know, I always knew

28:57.736 --> 28:59.271
there was more to his story
than he let on.

28:59.305 --> 29:01.874
You know? Even as a kid,
like, I would ask him questions

29:01.908 --> 29:05.778
or a war movie would come on,
you know, and, um...

29:05.812 --> 29:09.048
I don't know,
something would come over him,

29:09.081 --> 29:11.383
you know, l-like, uh...

29:11.417 --> 29:12.985
like, as if he was haunted.

29:13.019 --> 29:17.456
Well, he wasn't haunted
when I got pulled out.

29:17.489 --> 29:20.893
I, uh, tried writing him.

29:20.927 --> 29:23.062
-Never heard back.
-Hmm.

29:23.095 --> 29:26.532
And then, you know, time.

29:27.666 --> 29:30.903
-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

29:30.937 --> 29:32.738
And, uh, these guys here,

29:32.771 --> 29:34.974
you know,
might they know something?

29:35.007 --> 29:38.244
Uh, him there,
that's-that's Townie.

29:38.277 --> 29:41.580
I heard he passed from cancer
about, uh, ten years ago.

29:41.613 --> 29:44.951
And that's Murphy.
Died in-country.

29:44.984 --> 29:47.653
And, uh, that man,
I don't know him.

29:47.686 --> 29:49.788
-No.

29:49.822 --> 29:51.757
It says "Pearson"
on this guy's shirt.

29:51.790 --> 29:54.360
I'm pretty sure that's my uncle
that died in the war.

29:54.393 --> 29:56.762
-Hmm.
-My dad never talked
about him much,

29:56.795 --> 29:59.331
uh, so...
You ever cross paths with him?

29:59.365 --> 30:00.699
No, no.

30:02.835 --> 30:07.173
Look, son,
I-I know you come a long way,

30:07.206 --> 30:11.143
and I'm sorry I don't have
the answers you're looking for.

30:11.177 --> 30:14.981
But in my experience
with this particular war,

30:15.014 --> 30:18.784
sometimes the answers
are so dark

30:18.817 --> 30:21.353
you're better off
not having them.

30:32.364 --> 30:35.367
-Fixing your fridge.

30:35.401 --> 30:38.470
I'm almost done. Hey, Randall.

30:38.504 --> 30:41.407
Why are you home so early?
Prom that boring?

30:41.440 --> 30:43.409
Never made it there.

30:43.442 --> 30:45.844
Her dad freaked out
when he saw me.

30:45.878 --> 30:48.780
-So...

30:51.250 --> 30:53.852
You know I was born
in Puerto Rico?

30:53.886 --> 30:57.723
I, uh, came here to Pittsburgh
when I was eight years old.

30:57.756 --> 31:00.893
And I was determined

31:00.927 --> 31:03.062
to not have an accent

31:03.095 --> 31:05.264
'cause I was gonna be starting
at a new school.

31:05.297 --> 31:09.101
So I studied
every American TV show.

31:09.135 --> 31:12.404
I repeated every line from every
commercial all summer long.

31:12.438 --> 31:15.241
And the second...

31:15.274 --> 31:17.409
I walked into class
on the first day,

31:17.443 --> 31:19.611
before I could even say a word,

31:19.645 --> 31:22.915
those kids,
they gave me a nickname:

31:22.949 --> 31:26.685
Ricky Ricardo. Who's Cuban.

31:30.589 --> 31:33.359
I started entering every room

31:33.392 --> 31:35.928
saying, "Lucy, I'm home."

31:38.097 --> 31:41.633
But you are stronger than I was.

31:41.667 --> 31:44.436
-Even at that age, Randall.
-Thanks.

31:44.470 --> 31:47.073
But I'm-I'm tired,
so I'm gonna go to bed.

31:53.345 --> 31:54.913
I-I feel like my brain's
gonna explode, you know?

31:54.947 --> 31:56.782
I feel like I learned
a lot today,

31:56.815 --> 31:58.750
but at the same time, I feel
like I didn't learn anything.

31:59.918 --> 32:02.654
You order room service?

32:02.688 --> 32:05.091
Uh, delivery for Kevin Pearson?

32:05.124 --> 32:06.725
Oh, that's for you.

32:06.758 --> 32:08.560
Oh.

32:08.594 --> 32:09.695
I got the best one I could find.

32:12.198 --> 32:15.234
You got me a pillowcase?

32:15.267 --> 32:17.469
Yeah. It seemed really important
to you, so...

32:20.106 --> 32:22.241
Um, Kevin...

32:22.274 --> 32:25.444
Yeah.

32:25.477 --> 32:28.314
The reason I need
the silk pillowcase

32:28.347 --> 32:30.649
is because it keeps
my hair from drying.

32:30.682 --> 32:34.620
And today, at the gas station,

32:34.653 --> 32:37.689
the clerk was racist.

32:37.723 --> 32:39.925
You're kidding me.
What'd she say to you?

32:39.958 --> 32:43.762
She didn't say anything, but she
assumed we weren't together.

32:43.795 --> 32:46.598
And she was sharp with me
because she was bothered

32:46.632 --> 32:49.635
by a black person invading
a white person's space.

32:51.403 --> 32:53.972
Why are you just now
telling me this?

32:56.508 --> 33:00.379
Because I think, God help me,

33:00.412 --> 33:04.316
I think you just might
be worth it.

33:15.594 --> 33:17.963
REBECCA: You know,
when I was three years old,

33:17.996 --> 33:22.368
my mom sang me this lullaby, and
once was all I needed to hear it

33:22.401 --> 33:25.337
before I could sing it back.

33:25.371 --> 33:27.706
Music was always in me.

33:29.941 --> 33:35.081
And I put it aside
lots of times.

33:35.114 --> 33:39.251
Out of fear and sadness,

33:39.285 --> 33:42.921
and lots of reasons.

33:45.757 --> 33:49.228
It's funny. When Miguel
brought the piano here today,

33:49.261 --> 33:51.530
you said it made the room
look a lot smaller.

33:51.563 --> 33:55.267
And to me,
it felt so much bigger.

33:55.301 --> 33:57.903
'Cause music has
always represented

33:57.936 --> 34:02.108
this huge, empty room
that I could just walk right in

34:02.141 --> 34:04.710
and let myself pour out.

34:15.321 --> 34:19.225
* All through the night

34:19.258 --> 34:22.228
* I'll be awake *

34:22.261 --> 34:25.897
* And I'll be with you... *

34:25.931 --> 34:28.234
Can you sing that back to me?

34:28.267 --> 34:30.436
Come on.

34:35.307 --> 34:37.243
I can't.

34:39.478 --> 34:43.982
Okay. It's okay.

34:44.015 --> 34:47.486
You're not ready.

34:47.519 --> 34:51.290
But one day, I know you're gonna
sit back down at this piano

34:51.323 --> 34:53.992
and start singing again.

34:56.495 --> 34:58.096
'Cause it's gonna be a place

34:58.130 --> 35:00.466
where you can put
all of that sadness.

35:03.001 --> 35:06.672
And because it's what
you're meant to do.

35:31.497 --> 35:36.302
* Everybody knows
what they want to be *

35:38.804 --> 35:40.772
* Lately, I've been
feeling like *

35:40.806 --> 35:44.710
* Everyone knows but me

35:44.743 --> 35:49.848
* Been keeping my head down

35:49.881 --> 35:51.950
* For too long

35:51.983 --> 35:56.021
* Now

35:56.054 --> 35:58.023
-* There were...

35:58.056 --> 36:00.392
-Hey.
-Oh, God, hey. Hi, hi.

36:00.426 --> 36:03.495
I am so sorry.
I know I'm late. Hi.

36:05.931 --> 36:08.033
The doctor already called.

36:12.170 --> 36:15.073
It worked, baby.

36:17.876 --> 36:19.978
-I'm pregnant.

36:20.011 --> 36:22.348
:
Yes. Yes.

36:28.387 --> 36:33.024
Okay. Okay. Yeah, yeah.

36:43.068 --> 36:46.071
Hey. Toby, it's okay.

36:46.104 --> 36:49.741
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

36:49.775 --> 36:52.611
It's okay.

36:59.551 --> 37:00.619
Give yourself a break.

37:00.652 --> 37:02.454
It was your first day, you know?

37:02.488 --> 37:05.357
You know more now. Seen more
faces, heard more voices.

37:05.391 --> 37:06.858
Yeah. Screaming at me.

37:06.892 --> 37:09.961
Well. Complacent people
don't scream, baby.

37:09.995 --> 37:11.597
I said that, huh?

37:11.630 --> 37:14.533
Yes, you did.
And you'll never say it again.

37:14.566 --> 37:17.803
They grew up with the man, Beth.

37:17.836 --> 37:20.038
They are him, he's them.

37:20.071 --> 37:21.807
I'm gonna have to find
a different way.

37:22.941 --> 37:24.810
-Yo. Baby.
Hmm.

37:24.843 --> 37:27.746
Your interview. I didn't ask
you. Tell me, tell me, please.

37:27.779 --> 37:29.815
What's there to say, you know?

37:29.848 --> 37:32.217
-I was a boss.
-Yes. Of course you were.

37:32.250 --> 37:34.320
So when they make you this job
offer, you're gonna take it?

37:34.353 --> 37:36.588
All right, we'll see
about the offer, okay?

37:36.622 --> 37:38.324
We'll see what happens
when the deal comes in.

37:38.357 --> 37:39.958
Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am.

37:39.991 --> 37:42.461
-Yes. I love you.

37:42.494 --> 37:43.595
Drive safe.

37:43.629 --> 37:46.598
Hey, at least you didn't cry.

37:46.632 --> 37:49.034
-See you.

37:53.171 --> 37:55.341
BETH: Yeah, and the Hexpods
in New York

37:55.374 --> 37:56.842
really inspired me.

37:56.875 --> 37:58.109
I feel like we can
do something similar here,

37:58.143 --> 37:59.978
just improve upon the idea.

38:00.011 --> 38:04.249
Well, your last boss, Bill,
couldn't rave about you more.

38:04.282 --> 38:06.184
That must've been hard
parting ways.

38:06.217 --> 38:09.455
We don't see a lot of résumés
with 12 years at one place.

38:09.488 --> 38:12.190
Yeah. Oh, gosh.

38:12.223 --> 38:14.259
I was there for a long time,
but you know,

38:14.292 --> 38:19.130
budget cuts, and um...
but, um, yeah.

38:19.164 --> 38:21.600
Bill and I practically started
that company together.

38:21.633 --> 38:24.169
I was just a kid.

38:24.202 --> 38:26.271
Wide-eyed, and-and,

38:26.304 --> 38:30.909
uh, committed to serving
the underserved.

38:34.913 --> 38:36.882
Sorry.

38:36.915 --> 38:39.050
It's still a little raw.

38:39.084 --> 38:41.286
Um, what was I saying?

38:41.319 --> 38:44.356
Um... yes.

38:44.390 --> 38:46.525
So, I was there for a while,

38:46.558 --> 38:49.361
and, um, I, uh...

38:52.831 --> 38:54.933
Beth, are you all right?

39:00.672 --> 39:03.308
Could you give me...
could you give me a minute?

39:03.341 --> 39:05.877
-Of course.
-Okay, thank you.

39:05.911 --> 39:08.013
Thank you.

39:10.281 --> 39:12.250
KATE:
I think it's been five weeks

39:12.283 --> 39:14.219
since he's been off of them.

39:15.353 --> 39:17.389
I know, Dr. Weiss.

39:17.423 --> 39:19.190
Okay.

39:19.224 --> 39:21.727
Thank you. Bye.

39:21.760 --> 39:25.263
* I lost you a while ago

39:25.296 --> 39:27.365
* But still

39:27.399 --> 39:29.501
-* I don't know why *

39:29.535 --> 39:31.837
I just spoke to the doctor.
They want you

39:31.870 --> 39:34.205
to come in tomorrow and talk
about adjusting your meds.

39:36.207 --> 39:41.012
* I can't say your name *

39:41.046 --> 39:45.517
-* Without a crow flying by...

39:45.551 --> 39:47.052
I didn't know
what to do with him.

39:47.085 --> 39:48.554
-It's okay. You were right

39:48.587 --> 39:50.355
to bringing him here, all right?
You go ahead

39:50.388 --> 39:51.923
and tale the limo home. I'm
gonna take care of him, okay?

39:51.957 --> 39:53.759
-Okay.
-Come on, Kevin.
I got you, buddy.

39:53.792 --> 39:55.561
-I hope you feel better.
-Come on.

39:55.594 --> 39:57.729
Watch the steps.

39:57.763 --> 39:59.264
Hey, it's Miguel.

39:59.297 --> 40:01.299
-REBECCA: No.

40:01.332 --> 40:03.301
Miguel...

40:03.334 --> 40:04.936
...you fixed the fridge.

40:04.970 --> 40:06.938
Yeah, um,

40:06.972 --> 40:09.741
listen, Kevin's here.

40:09.775 --> 40:13.278
He's fine, but he's had
a little too much to drink.

40:13.311 --> 40:15.981
-Okay. I'm on my way.
-No, no, no, no. It's okay.

40:16.014 --> 40:19.217
I've got him, and he's sleeping,
so, um...

40:19.250 --> 40:21.386
he's fine here, really.

40:21.419 --> 40:23.421
Oh.

40:23.455 --> 40:26.458
Miguel...

40:26.492 --> 40:28.293
thank you...

40:28.326 --> 40:31.597
for all you're doing to help.

40:31.630 --> 40:33.932
You're too good to us.

40:33.965 --> 40:36.401
-We don't deserve you.

40:36.434 --> 40:38.904
JACK:
Hey, Miguel,

40:38.937 --> 40:40.772
you gonna act out
the plays for me,

40:40.806 --> 40:42.508
or can I maybe see the TV, too?

40:42.541 --> 40:44.576
Here.

40:44.610 --> 40:46.411
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

40:46.444 --> 40:49.347
* With gatting guns
and paint... *

40:49.380 --> 40:51.149
-Yeah.

40:51.182 --> 40:52.618
-Oof.
-Yeah, I know.

40:52.651 --> 40:54.085
-Yeah.

40:54.119 --> 40:56.522
Hey, you shouldn't pay
for that scam.

40:56.555 --> 40:59.290
-No. Jack Pearson don't die.

40:59.324 --> 41:00.992
Yeah.

41:01.026 --> 41:04.095
Hey, but seriously, man...

41:04.129 --> 41:07.633
I get hit by a bus,
you'll look out for 'em, right?

41:07.666 --> 41:12.704
* Oh, my brother, be careful

41:12.738 --> 41:17.509
* You are drifting away

41:20.211 --> 41:25.350
* Throw me a rope

41:25.383 --> 41:30.856
-* On the rolling tide...

41:30.889 --> 41:32.958
-Hi.
-Hi.

41:36.494 --> 41:39.464
You have to understand
the Jack I knew

41:39.497 --> 41:43.168
wanted everything from that war
behind him.

41:43.201 --> 41:45.303
But who's to say
he wouldn't have wanted you

41:45.336 --> 41:47.172
to know his story?

41:47.205 --> 41:52.678
* The way you made it

41:52.711 --> 41:55.681
* That's the way it will be... *

41:55.714 --> 41:58.049
I hope these help.

41:59.517 --> 42:01.853
Thank you.

42:04.923 --> 42:10.028
* The way you made it

42:10.061 --> 42:16.568
* That's the way it will be. *
