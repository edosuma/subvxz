00:12.250 --> 00:15.440
I'm really looking forward
to your lumber party.

00:16.770 --> 00:18.730
It's not a lumber party.

00:18.730 --> 00:21.250
It's a slumber party.

00:24.130 --> 00:27.100
Wait. You guys are having a party?

00:27.130 --> 00:29.200
Oh, yeah.
How rude of me.

00:29.230 --> 00:32.270
I really should have
not invited you sooner.

00:34.100 --> 00:36.370
Ooh, can I be not invited, too?

00:36.410 --> 00:38.340
Sure.
Yes!

00:42.050 --> 00:44.210
Well,

00:44.250 --> 00:48.120
yours won't be the only
sleepover in the neighborhood.

00:48.150 --> 00:50.220
Olive and I are having a
slumber party that night, too,

00:50.250 --> 00:53.190
and you're not invited to ours.

00:53.220 --> 00:55.120
Party? What party?

00:55.160 --> 00:56.330
We're not having a party.

00:58.060 --> 00:59.390
It's okay, Olive.

00:59.430 --> 01:04.370
You don't have to keep our
secret party a secret anymore.

01:04.400 --> 01:06.440
The cat's out of the bag.

01:06.470 --> 01:08.300
What secret?

01:08.340 --> 01:11.370
What party? What cat?
I am very confused.

01:13.080 --> 01:16.250
You get used to it.

01:16.280 --> 01:21.050
Anyway, our party is going to be a
gazillion times more fun than yours.

01:21.080 --> 01:25.350
I doubt it. We're having mani-pedis,
facials, and a crepe bar.

01:28.020 --> 01:31.090
Well, we've got cats in bags.

01:33.100 --> 01:34.200
We should probably go check on them.

01:34.230 --> 01:36.430
How long have they been in the bags?

01:36.431 --> 01:36.469

Whoo!

02:33.290 --> 02:35.090
Fletcher!

02:35.120 --> 02:40.030
I have an opportunity for you
that will change your life.

02:40.060 --> 02:41.430
But I like my life.

02:43.300 --> 02:44.500
Why?

02:46.440 --> 02:49.300
Good point. Go on.

02:49.340 --> 02:53.110
Last night I came up
to do a comic book, ar idea

02:53.140 --> 02:54.980
and since you're a great artist,

02:55.010 --> 02:56.310
I want you to draw it for me.

02:56.350 --> 02:58.180
What's the idea?

02:58.210 --> 03:00.180
I just told you.
To do a comic book.

03:00.220 --> 03:03.150
Boom!
Right there! Llars,

03:04.390 --> 03:06.120
That's the whole idea?

03:06.160 --> 03:08.060
What about characters?
Plot lines?

03:08.090 --> 03:11.360
Sure, I guess we could add some of those.

03:11.390 --> 03:14.100
So what do you say?
You in, partner?

03:14.130 --> 03:16.930
No thanks.
To collaborate.

03:16.970 --> 03:18.230
I'm a lone wolf.

03:23.010 --> 03:25.070
Well, I was a lone wolf.

03:36.150 --> 03:39.290
Niya, come to my sleepover party!

03:39.320 --> 03:42.990
Megan, come to my sleepover party!

03:43.030 --> 03:45.430
Svetlana, come to my...

03:49.130 --> 03:50.400
What I was trying to say was...

03:56.040 --> 03:57.140
Here!

04:00.280 --> 04:04.050
You know what?
I'll just text you the deets.

04:04.080 --> 04:05.950
Chyna, you're having a party?

04:05.980 --> 04:07.320
What time should I be there?

04:07.350 --> 04:10.990
Sorry, Fletcher.
This is an all girls party.

04:11.020 --> 04:13.160
Duh, why do you think I want to go?

04:17.089 --> 04:21.029
Listen, Chyna, I have bad news.

04:21.060 --> 04:22.930
I can't make your sleepover.

04:22.970 --> 04:24.970
What? Why not?

04:25.000 --> 04:28.200
I, uh, have a dentist appointment.

04:29.410 --> 04:31.370
In the middle of the night?

04:31.410 --> 04:34.980
Is your dentist a vampire?

04:35.010 --> 04:38.410
Yeah, and you do not want to
go there with bleeding gums.

04:40.180 --> 04:42.050
Olive, what's really going on here?

04:43.190 --> 04:45.050
The truth is

04:45.090 --> 04:48.120
I've never slept anywhere
outside my house. Ever.

04:48.160 --> 04:51.160
Not even when I had my appendix out.

04:51.190 --> 04:53.330
You were awake during surgery?

04:53.360 --> 04:54.960
Yeah, it was painful,

04:55.000 --> 04:57.330
but at least I could tell
them how to do it right.

04:58.470 --> 05:01.100
Come on, Olive, you have to come!

05:01.140 --> 05:04.070
My party won't be as much fun without you.

05:04.110 --> 05:08.340
That's true.
I am fun at a party.

05:08.380 --> 05:11.410
And if it makes you more comfortable,
bring something from home.

05:22.090 --> 05:26.030
When I said, "Bring something from
home," I meant like a pillow.

05:26.960 --> 05:28.360
I did bring a pillow.

05:30.400 --> 05:33.100
You're staying over for one night.

05:33.140 --> 05:35.140
How many of your clothes did you pack?

05:35.170 --> 05:36.440
All of them.

05:37.970 --> 05:39.210
Why?

05:39.240 --> 05:41.310
I don't know what I'm
going to wear tomorrow.

05:41.340 --> 05:45.210
I don't choose my outfit the night
before like some obsessive freak.

05:47.320 --> 05:49.080
Be careful with that.

05:49.120 --> 05:51.150
That bag has my breakfast!

05:51.190 --> 05:55.320
I like to eat this really rare, special
cereal that you guys don't have.

05:57.260 --> 05:58.430
Corn Flakes?

06:00.430 --> 06:03.230
I think we have Corn Flakes.

06:03.270 --> 06:05.130
No, I've seen your cabinets,

06:05.170 --> 06:07.900
and you only have
Honey Crusted Sugar Loops,

06:07.940 --> 06:09.240
Donut Crisp, Sugar Frosted Sugar Cubes,

06:09.270 --> 06:14.040
Cap'n Choc-o-Lard, Candy Cane
Crunch, and High Fructose-ios.

06:14.080 --> 06:18.180
Those are my dad's.
I don't eat that unhealthy junk.

06:18.210 --> 06:20.950
I usually just have leftover pie.

06:22.390 --> 06:26.290
Anyway, you can put your
sleeping bag right here.

06:26.320 --> 06:28.390
You want me to sleep on the floor?

06:34.130 --> 06:37.130
Olive, your bed weighs a ton!

06:37.170 --> 06:41.400
Don't complain. We still have to carry
up my headboard and nightstand.

06:49.380 --> 06:52.250
Hey Cameron, I've been thinking,

06:54.280 --> 06:56.180
and I want to help you
with your comic book.

06:57.350 --> 06:59.250
I thought you didn't like that idea.

06:59.290 --> 07:02.390
Are you kidding?
Pictures and words?

07:03.190 --> 07:05.090
Groundbreaking.

07:05.130 --> 07:07.900
Okay, but it might be hard to work here.

07:07.930 --> 07:10.270
My sister's having a bunch
of girls over tonight.

07:10.300 --> 07:13.970
Really?
Is that tonight?

07:14.000 --> 07:18.010
I'm willing to put up with
them and work here anyway.

07:18.040 --> 07:21.210
Good, because I came up
with an awesome superhero.

07:21.240 --> 07:24.180
Iron Man!

07:24.210 --> 07:28.350
Uh, I'm pretty sure there
already is an Iron Man.

07:28.380 --> 07:31.050
Not the guy in the suit made of iron,

07:31.090 --> 07:33.360
a guy with a suit made of irons!

07:33.390 --> 07:37.090
He'll have irons for hands
and an ironing board cape,

07:37.130 --> 07:40.160
and of course his tights.
No wrinkles at all.

07:42.270 --> 07:44.130
I'm having trouble picturing it.

07:44.170 --> 07:46.130
But if I could see you in this outfit,

07:46.170 --> 07:48.040
I could draw it perfectly.

07:48.070 --> 07:49.940
But where are we going to find tights?

07:49.970 --> 07:52.110
Ooh, I know! Chyna's room!
I'll go get them!

07:53.340 --> 07:55.380
No need.
Already wearing 'em!

07:59.120 --> 08:01.020
But you didn't know I was coming over.

08:02.950 --> 08:04.290
You didn't call first?

08:06.090 --> 08:07.220
No.

08:08.890 --> 08:11.090
Okay, we got your bed set up.

08:11.130 --> 08:13.900
Is the room ready for you to sleep in?

08:18.300 --> 08:21.140
No, no, no! Why are yout will
be painting my walls? Painting.

08:21.170 --> 08:25.870
Because color can have a powerful
effect on mood and behavior.

08:25.910 --> 08:27.840
Green is soothing.

08:27.880 --> 08:31.050
I can't sleep in a room that's purple.

08:33.150 --> 08:36.850
Olive, how many times have I
told you not to paint my walls?

08:36.890 --> 08:38.919
Once.
I'm saying it right now.

08:38.960 --> 08:40.990
Do not paint my walls!

08:41.020 --> 08:46.190
See, I think a lot of this hostility
is coming from the purple.

08:46.230 --> 08:49.330
I can't have wet paint everywhere
when everybody shows up.

08:51.870 --> 08:53.200
Where is everybody?

08:57.240 --> 09:01.240
Hmm. I'm getting a video chat
request from "Prettier Than U."

09:03.050 --> 09:05.050
<i>Hey, Chyna!</i>

09:07.250 --> 09:10.250
I just wanted to check in and see
how your slumber party's going.

09:10.290 --> 09:14.160
<i>Are you</i>
<i>raising the roof?</i>

09:14.190 --> 09:18.830
<i>No, but that's</i> <i>the only
renovation</i> <i>we haven't done.</i>

09:20.900 --> 09:23.900
Is that a chocolate fountain?

09:23.930 --> 09:27.270
Niya! She's supposed
to be at my party.

09:27.300 --> 09:31.110
Oh, yeah, a few of your Ant
friends are over here.

09:31.140 --> 09:33.070
Like, all of them.

09:35.850 --> 09:37.050
Hello!

09:39.980 --> 09:42.150
<i>Well, not all of them.</i>

09:42.180 --> 09:46.290
<i>Olive's here</i> <i>and we're
having</i> <i>a great time.</i>

09:46.320 --> 09:50.160
<i>Chyna,</i> <i>these paint
fumes</i> <i>are making me...</i>

09:59.870 --> 10:02.520
Okay, green is not always soothing.

10:09.650 --> 10:11.310
So you didn't like Iron Man,

10:11.310 --> 10:14.160
but I think I came up with
another great superhero idea.

10:14.190 --> 10:16.390
Okay. Can't wait.

10:16.430 --> 10:18.260
Hey, listen, while you're changing,

10:18.290 --> 10:19.460
I'm going to check on the girls.

10:19.500 --> 10:22.160
Make sure no one was
injured in a pillow fight.

10:23.270 --> 10:24.970
No, I'm ready!

10:30.510 --> 10:33.210
Your superhero is a guy in a shirt?

10:35.110 --> 10:38.150
No. This is my
mild-mannered alter ego.

10:38.180 --> 10:41.080
You've heard of Batman.
You've heard of Spider-Man.

10:41.120 --> 10:43.250
Well, say hello to.

10:43.290 --> 10:44.590
Man Man!

10:47.190 --> 10:49.360
So he has the powers of a man?

10:51.290 --> 10:54.160
Yeah, but that man belongs to a gym.

10:56.600 --> 10:59.430
Now how am I supposed to
compete with Lexi's party?

10:59.470 --> 11:03.100
She's got big crowds, chocolate
fountains, and mani-pedis.

11:03.140 --> 11:05.370
I've got wet paint and vomit!

11:09.450 --> 11:11.210
Wait.
Where did you get that?

11:11.250 --> 11:14.180
Oh.
Your dad lent it to me.

11:14.220 --> 11:17.250
Of course, he's making me paint
the garage this weekend.

11:18.390 --> 11:21.090
This whole night is a disaster.

11:21.120 --> 11:24.190
Calm down, Chyna.

11:24.230 --> 11:28.160
Look at the green.
Look at the green.

11:29.470 --> 11:31.330
That's it!

11:31.370 --> 11:33.200
The green!

11:36.340 --> 11:40.140
This is awesome! It's like all
these people are at your party.

11:40.180 --> 11:41.540
Except they're not.

11:43.210 --> 11:46.180
I just used my computer
to replace the green wall

11:46.220 --> 11:48.380
with this old movie footage I found online.

11:48.420 --> 11:52.420
It's time to call Lexi
and make her green with envy.

11:52.450 --> 11:55.120
You mean green with calmness.

11:55.160 --> 11:58.330
I say we make her purple with
discomfort, but it's your call.

12:01.160 --> 12:02.530
Hi, Chyna.
I knew it was you

12:02.560 --> 12:07.100
because you're the only
one not at my party.

12:07.140 --> 12:12.110
<i>What? Sorry,</i> <i>I can barely
hear you</i> <i>over the noise.</i>

12:12.140 --> 12:16.310
<i>Guys, keep it down.</i>
<i>I'm video chatting.</i>

12:18.280 --> 12:20.480
<i>Brendan, you're so crazy!</i>

12:22.220 --> 12:24.120
Who are all those people?

12:24.150 --> 12:26.520
Oh, friends of mine.
You don't know them.

12:26.560 --> 12:29.190
I have a lot of cool friends.

12:29.220 --> 12:31.230
Speaking of cool friends,
I'm kind of chilly.

12:31.260 --> 12:32.530
Can I borrow this green hoodie?

12:32.560 --> 12:34.230
No, no, no, Olive...

12:40.240 --> 12:41.500
What happened to Olive?

12:42.470 --> 12:44.510
Um, I haven't seen her.

12:49.440 --> 12:52.380
That party looks awesome.

12:52.410 --> 12:54.550
Is that a young Jim Belushi?

12:54.580 --> 12:57.150
Paisley, didn't I tell you?

12:57.190 --> 12:59.420
"If you don't have anything mean to say,

12:59.450 --> 13:02.120
"don't say
anything at all."

13:02.160 --> 13:05.260
Besides, our party is way better.

13:05.290 --> 13:07.530
We're having crepes
and getting mani-pedis.

13:11.430 --> 13:17.040
Really? Well,
we are having sushi

13:17.070 --> 13:20.510
and getting our hair done
by a world-renowned stylist.

13:20.540 --> 13:23.280
What? Great!

13:23.310 --> 13:26.210
I just got chocolate on my pajamas!

13:26.250 --> 13:28.480
A little club soda should
get that stain right out.

13:30.490 --> 13:32.290
Dab. Don't rub.

13:35.190 --> 13:39.230
Anyway, as you can see, we're
obviously having a fabulous time.

13:41.530 --> 13:44.530
Oh, the sushi chef is here!
Gotta go!

13:51.310 --> 13:52.440
I don't know what it is,

13:52.470 --> 13:54.240
but suddenly I have all these great ideas!

13:54.280 --> 13:57.450
It's like I have superpowers.
Maybe I can fly.

13:58.350 --> 14:00.250
No!

14:11.390 --> 14:14.360
Please tell me this is not a
sugar induced hallucination.

14:17.370 --> 14:19.230
Hello, ladies.

14:30.880 --> 14:35.780
Oh, Brendan, where did you
learn to dance like this?

14:35.820 --> 14:39.820
From your father, the honorable ambassador

14:39.960 --> 14:41.780
to Argentina?

14:45.130 --> 14:47.030
What was that?

14:47.060 --> 14:48.800
I changed the footage.

14:48.830 --> 14:51.830
Nothing kicks a party
up a notch like penguins!

14:56.000 --> 14:59.720
Yeah. I don't think Lexi's going to
be impressed by a mother penguin

14:59.800 --> 15:02.740
spitting up a half-digested
herring into its baby's mouth.

15:03.210 --> 15:04.880
We'll see, won't we?

15:10.850 --> 15:11.950
No answer.

15:11.990 --> 15:13.750
Hmm.
I wonder where they are.

15:15.020 --> 15:16.720
Go away, Cameron.

15:16.760 --> 15:19.730
If you wore the tights,
I do not want them back.

15:21.700 --> 15:23.660
Lexi?
Aha!

15:23.700 --> 15:25.900
I knew something weird was going on here.

15:25.930 --> 15:27.940
Where are all your guests?

15:28.770 --> 15:30.770
Um...

15:30.810 --> 15:33.040
I sent them off on a scavenger hunt.

15:33.080 --> 15:35.880
Is one of the things you
have to find an ugly hat?

15:38.050 --> 15:39.750
Yes.

15:40.120 --> 15:41.120
Olive's in the lead.

15:41.950 --> 15:44.720
Yes!

15:44.750 --> 15:46.790
Well, maybe we can at
least get our hair done

15:46.820 --> 15:48.790
by your world renowned stylist.

15:48.820 --> 15:52.890
Unless he was slaughtered by
the ninja or Jim Belushi.

15:54.160 --> 15:56.860
No, he's here.

15:56.900 --> 15:58.130
I'll just

15:58.930 --> 15:59.930
go get him.

16:01.800 --> 16:04.210
Olive, why don't you entertain our guests?

16:14.120 --> 16:16.120
So, which of these is
our million dollar idea?

16:16.150 --> 16:17.950
None of them!

16:18.990 --> 16:20.720
Seriously?

16:21.820 --> 16:22.990
Pool Boy?

16:25.130 --> 16:26.730
Dare Deviled Egg?

16:28.900 --> 16:30.130
Spider Manatee?

16:31.900 --> 16:34.170
And worst of all, Iron Man.

16:35.870 --> 16:38.040
I mean, a superhero who irons?

16:38.070 --> 16:39.970
That's my mom!

16:41.180 --> 16:42.910
So then what do you suggest?

16:42.950 --> 16:45.710
Maybe we should do
some focus group testing.

16:45.750 --> 16:49.050
I'll go see if I can find
some girls ages 11 to 17.

16:50.820 --> 16:52.050
Guys, it's an emergency!

16:52.090 --> 16:54.190
I need someone to do our hair!
Do you know anyone?

16:55.090 --> 16:57.020
That's it!

16:57.060 --> 17:00.760
This looks like a job for The Stylist!

17:03.030 --> 17:05.770
You don't have anything on under there.

17:05.800 --> 17:07.800
I know. This is how
stylists wear their shirts.

17:30.030 --> 17:32.060
So, do you guys know anyone or not?

17:37.130 --> 17:41.840
Ha! I knew it!
This sleepover is a big lie.

17:41.870 --> 17:43.940
You don't have a hair stylist.

17:43.970 --> 17:46.070
Don't be so sure about that, citizen.

17:48.180 --> 17:50.780
The Stylist is here!

17:52.080 --> 17:54.880
Fletcher?
He's not a stylist.

17:54.920 --> 17:58.090
That's right, I'm The Stylist.

17:59.990 --> 18:03.960
Fighting crime and dry,
hard to manage hair.

18:24.810 --> 18:26.810
You are now safe, citizen.

18:26.850 --> 18:29.920
From the front and the back.

18:31.690 --> 18:34.820
Wow, a shark!
I love it!

18:34.860 --> 18:37.860
I just hope my head doesn't
get caught in a fishing net.

18:39.160 --> 18:41.830
It's happened before.

18:45.930 --> 18:47.900
How is Fletcher doing that?

18:47.940 --> 18:49.040
He's an artist.

18:49.070 --> 18:50.770
Hair is just another medium.

18:52.170 --> 18:53.970
A sports car!

18:56.040 --> 18:59.680
Who else has hair that needs justice?

18:59.710 --> 19:03.080
No one. Come on, girls.
This party stinks.

19:03.120 --> 19:05.090
Let's go back to my place.

19:10.890 --> 19:12.930
Paisley! Now!

19:12.960 --> 19:17.870
No. I'm staying!
This party is fun.

19:17.900 --> 19:21.940
Lexi, if you want, you can stay
and have fun with the rest of us.

19:21.970 --> 19:24.870
Fun?
Your stylist is Fletcher,

19:24.910 --> 19:26.770
the sushi chef is fake,

19:26.810 --> 19:29.840
and that nightclub was just a
trick using this green wall.

19:29.880 --> 19:33.710
Ooh! I could give you a hairstyle
with devil horns. It'll be hot.

19:36.720 --> 19:38.720
Get this off me!

19:38.750 --> 19:41.660
You're going to wrinkle my pajamas.

19:41.690 --> 19:43.990
Did someone say wrinkle?

19:46.160 --> 19:50.100
This sounds like a job for Iron Man!

19:52.130 --> 19:55.000
Hey, bro. You got a little
Candy Cane Crunch right there.

19:55.040 --> 19:56.700
Oh, thanks.

20:13.050 --> 20:15.120
Not like that, like this.

20:32.970 --> 20:35.040
Last night was so much fun!

20:35.080 --> 20:37.210
I actually slept outside my house!

20:39.010 --> 20:40.980
Good for you, Olive.

20:41.020 --> 20:43.880
Hey, where are all the other girls?

20:45.120 --> 20:48.160
They kind of all left
in the middle of the night.

20:48.190 --> 20:50.820
I would've too, but I live here.

20:51.890 --> 20:54.200
Why? What happened?
I was asleep.

20:54.230 --> 20:57.030
Yeah, but not in bed.

21:00.940 --> 21:03.040
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

21:04.770 --> 21:07.110
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

21:07.140 --> 21:10.040
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

21:11.010 --> 21:13.050
Cock-a-doodle-doo!

21:32.070 --> 21:33.830
I don't do all that stuff in my sleep.

21:33.870 --> 21:35.200
Yes. Yes, you do.

21:36.940 --> 21:38.770
You do all sorts of crazy stuff.

21:38.810 --> 21:40.980
You even made me this sweater.
You sleep-knit!

21:43.010 --> 21:46.880
Now that you mention it, I do
sometimes wake up with a new blanket.

21:47.880 --> 21:50.750
Anyway, breakfast?

21:50.790 --> 21:52.020
Sure.

21:52.050 --> 21:55.760
What kind of milk do you
take on your Corn Flakes?

21:58.030 --> 21:59.860
1%? 2%?

21:59.890 --> 22:01.860
Soy milk?
Lactose-free?

22:01.900 --> 22:03.860
Chocolate?
Strawberry?

22:03.900 --> 22:06.170
Or hand-squeezed goat milk?

22:08.070 --> 22:09.900
Do you have skim?

22:11.070 --> 22:13.070
Skim?

22:13.720 --> 22:15.840
Who brings skim milk to a party?

22:16.040 --> 22:17.240
