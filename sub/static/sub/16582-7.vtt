WEBVTT

00:00.020 --> 00:01.626
Previously on "Graves"...

00:01.667 --> 00:03.666
I'm so glad we found each other, Olivia.

00:03.667 --> 00:06.666
Olivia, stop! Come on, let me ex...

00:06.667 --> 00:10.666
I just want to be anyone
else for one fucking moment.

00:10.667 --> 00:12.256
The Rockefellers want a mediation.

00:12.257 --> 00:14.045
What haven't you told us, honey?

00:14.046 --> 00:16.666
Mrs. Graves, you have a son

00:16.667 --> 00:18.666
- with unsolved issues of his past.
- This one's for you.

00:18.667 --> 00:21.666
This is Martin
Treadwell's first release request

00:21.667 --> 00:23.666
since his attempt
on the president's life.

00:23.667 --> 00:26.666
Why would I worry? It's
not like this hasn't stuck to me.

00:26.667 --> 00:28.204
Sammy, I like you.

00:28.205 --> 00:29.666
Are you okay?

00:29.667 --> 00:31.667
Yeah.

00:39.073 --> 00:41.929
This is all new territory for me.

00:42.968 --> 00:44.667
Brand-new.

00:47.667 --> 00:49.666
What?

00:50.688 --> 00:54.152
Nothing.

00:54.667 --> 00:55.953
I just...

00:57.667 --> 00:59.666
I like the way you look at me.

00:59.667 --> 01:02.667
It's like you found
a unicorn or something.

01:06.667 --> 01:08.666
- Isaiah.
- Oh, shit!

01:08.667 --> 01:11.666
- Kitchen, now.
- I'll sneak out.

01:11.667 --> 01:13.667
- Good idea.
- Okay.

01:15.000 --> 01:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:24.667 --> 01:26.666
We should have gone to the coffee shop.

01:26.667 --> 01:30.057
Oh, a little trust, sir.

01:30.667 --> 01:33.666
You know, a latchkey kid learns
to either cook or starve,

01:33.667 --> 01:35.667
so my mom taught me on the weekends.

01:43.667 --> 01:44.666
Mmm.

01:44.667 --> 01:46.666
You know, of all
the French mother sauces,

01:46.667 --> 01:48.667
I think hollandaise is my favorite.

01:49.667 --> 01:52.667
- Turn that up.
- Oh, sure.

01:53.667 --> 01:55.666
...construction to go through his lands.

01:55.667 --> 01:59.666
After two decades of legal challenges,
a federal appellate court

01:59.667 --> 02:02.666
has ruled that Route 124,
the Richard Graves Highway,

02:02.667 --> 02:05.666
named in honor of New Mexico's
former governor and president,

02:05.667 --> 02:08.666
can begin construction through
the Hennepaw tribal lands

02:08.667 --> 02:10.666
using the government's
eminent domain powers.

02:10.667 --> 02:12.666
This ruling has barred
any further appeal.

02:12.667 --> 02:15.666
You got a highway named after you.
Congratulations.

02:15.667 --> 02:17.666
I never asked for it.

02:17.667 --> 02:19.666
How do you and your
people feel about this action?

02:19.667 --> 02:22.666
The American government
authorized this highway

02:22.667 --> 02:24.666
to trespass on tribal territory

02:24.667 --> 02:27.666
in clear violation
of our existing US treaties.

02:27.667 --> 02:29.666
This is an act of war.

02:29.967 --> 02:31.666
Pratt.

02:31.667 --> 02:35.324
- Pratt. I know that name.
- Oh. Well...

02:36.667 --> 02:38.950
- Oh, my God, sir.
- What?

02:38.951 --> 02:41.666
40 years ago,
as a US federal prosecutor,

02:41.667 --> 02:45.666
Richard Graves prosecuted and
convicted Harlan Pratt for murder

02:45.667 --> 02:48.666
following a fire at the
Albuquerque federal building.

02:48.667 --> 02:52.666
Pratt's alleged arson was
responsible for two deaths.

02:53.058 --> 02:55.666
Harlan Pratt's son, okay, Russell,

02:55.667 --> 02:58.133
is an activist member
of the Hennepaw tribe.

02:58.134 --> 03:01.666
The Pratt conviction
galvanized support for Graves.

03:01.667 --> 03:02.839
The conviction...

03:04.194 --> 03:06.073
Read on.

03:06.993 --> 03:09.666
The Pratt case was widely
seen as a political move

03:09.667 --> 03:12.666
by then Prosecutor Graves who,
when running for governor,

03:12.667 --> 03:14.312
rode the conviction to a victory.

03:14.313 --> 03:17.107
Most see the questionable
conviction on weak evidence

03:17.108 --> 03:20.666
as essential to what would
become his eventual presidency.

03:20.667 --> 03:22.666
Harlan Pratt alleged
he'd been railroaded,

03:22.667 --> 03:26.666
claims that went unheard as Pratt
hanged himself in his jail cell

03:26.667 --> 03:28.667
just four days before his appeal.

03:33.667 --> 03:35.666
That guy on the news...

03:35.667 --> 03:37.666
Russell Pratt, sir.

03:37.667 --> 03:39.667
That's Harlan's son.

03:41.667 --> 03:43.499
Find him.

04:31.366 --> 04:33.365
So I got your letter.

04:33.667 --> 04:36.666
Thank you for coming

04:36.667 --> 04:38.666
to meet me before the hearing tomorrow.

04:39.445 --> 04:41.666
We actually met before
once when I was five

04:41.667 --> 04:45.666
and then in, like, hundreds of
nightmares over the last 23 years.

04:45.667 --> 04:48.379
So I want you to know
that I did want to see you

04:48.380 --> 04:49.666
before I sat in front
of the parole board

04:49.667 --> 04:51.666
to make sure that you never,

04:52.067 --> 04:53.973
ever get out of here.

04:58.667 --> 05:00.563
Why?

05:01.943 --> 05:04.666
There is no answer that I can give you

05:04.667 --> 05:06.666
that would make any kind of sense.

05:07.581 --> 05:10.666
What I know now is that Richard Graves

05:10.667 --> 05:14.666
was a great president and the
sick young man who shot him...

05:14.667 --> 05:16.183
My father. Shot my father.

05:16.184 --> 05:19.666
Who shot your father
is not someone I recognize.

05:19.667 --> 05:22.666
But the hardest part
about what I've done

05:22.667 --> 05:25.248
has been all the collateral damage.

05:27.667 --> 05:29.368
Especially my mom.

05:30.224 --> 05:31.856
And now she's dying.

05:33.239 --> 05:35.229
And I need to say good-bye,

05:36.120 --> 05:39.666
to explain that this
has not been her fault

05:39.667 --> 05:42.503
and that I'm so sorry.

05:50.667 --> 05:52.666
That will never happen.

06:00.103 --> 06:02.666
Ms. Graves acted without hesitation

06:02.981 --> 06:06.666
when she poured bleach on
your late father's portrait?

06:06.667 --> 06:07.666
Yes.

06:07.667 --> 06:09.666
She said that I had hurt
something that she loved,

06:09.667 --> 06:12.254
so she was going to hurt
something that I loved.

06:12.255 --> 06:14.666
And what exactly did she love?

06:15.703 --> 06:19.666
Well, I had slipped and accidentally
spilled a glass of red wine

06:19.667 --> 06:21.985
on a photo of her and Justin Timberlake.

06:21.986 --> 06:23.666
That was a gift from Justin

06:23.667 --> 06:25.666
when I did "The Mickey Mouse
Club" at the White House.

06:25.667 --> 06:27.666
The wine glass shattered.

06:27.667 --> 06:30.667
I needed surgery on my thumb
to repair the nerve damage.

06:32.052 --> 06:35.642
Still hurts when it rains
or if I push a button.

06:35.667 --> 06:38.332
And what about the incident at your home

06:38.333 --> 06:40.666
in Aspen, Christmas 2013?

06:41.190 --> 06:42.666
We were arguing on the way there.

06:43.043 --> 06:45.666
Olivia kicked me out
of the car and took off.

06:46.127 --> 06:48.666
- And where did you go?
- I walked.

06:49.343 --> 06:51.260
About four miles or so.

06:51.667 --> 06:54.666
It was snowing. Blizzard, actually.

06:54.997 --> 06:57.182
After a mile, my legs gave out.

06:57.667 --> 06:59.363
An Amish family found me.

06:59.364 --> 07:02.666
Hypothermia, frostbite, of course.

07:02.667 --> 07:05.667
Both thumbs basically useless.

07:06.533 --> 07:08.533
Rehab helps.

07:11.667 --> 07:14.666
Ultimately, Your Honor,
my client alleges

07:14.667 --> 07:18.666
that Olivia Graves was
pathologically incapable

07:18.834 --> 07:21.666
of true human intimacy

07:21.667 --> 07:25.049
because it was impossible
for her to feel empathy

07:25.074 --> 07:26.666
or to feel love.

07:26.667 --> 07:30.666
Mr. Rockefeller assumed
that these were emotions

07:30.667 --> 07:32.666
that she never learned.

07:32.667 --> 07:34.255
You are out of line, Gloria.

07:34.256 --> 07:35.988
- Maggie.
- Mrs. Graves.

07:35.989 --> 07:38.667
- We need a break right now.
- Ahem.

07:40.667 --> 07:44.667
Judge, give me a moment, please.

08:08.667 --> 08:11.667
Mr. Pratt, may we come in?

08:33.667 --> 08:35.666
My grandfather wants
to know why you're here.

08:35.667 --> 08:39.150
The highway through the reservation.

08:39.150 --> 08:41.205
The Richard Graves Highway.

08:41.206 --> 08:43.148
A final insult to my family.

08:43.173 --> 08:47.666
I didn't name that road, but
I want to help you stop it.

08:48.169 --> 08:49.488
Out of guilt?

08:49.489 --> 08:52.123
No, the highway's wrong.

08:52.667 --> 08:55.666
Breaks at least two US treaties.

08:55.667 --> 08:58.158
1868 for starters.

08:58.159 --> 09:01.666
Now, I broke them both drilling for oil.

09:01.667 --> 09:03.666
You broke just about everything.

09:04.667 --> 09:06.666
I can't do anything about the past,

09:06.667 --> 09:09.666
but I can do something about the future.

09:09.667 --> 09:13.666
Now, look, the US government
is a careless giant.

09:14.235 --> 09:16.666
I can talk to it

09:17.035 --> 09:20.594
because I was once a giant.

09:22.311 --> 09:24.666
Go and don't come back.

09:24.667 --> 09:27.666
You know, just because
they can't see past the past

09:27.667 --> 09:29.666
doesn't mean that
we can't still help them.

09:29.667 --> 09:32.666
Do you remember Moscow, sir?

09:32.667 --> 09:34.666
Gorbachev, he didn't want
to come to the table,

09:34.667 --> 09:36.666
so you twisted every arm
that held him up

09:36.667 --> 09:38.667
until they snapped at the elbow.

09:40.085 --> 09:41.666
Exactly.

09:41.897 --> 09:44.666
Exactly, Isaiah.

09:44.667 --> 09:48.666
You're getting it now, this path I'm on.

09:48.667 --> 09:51.899
A second chance. Yes, Isaiah.

09:51.924 --> 09:53.667
That's right.

10:05.157 --> 10:07.666
- It's me.
- Olivia, thank God.

10:07.667 --> 10:09.666
I'm so happy to hear your voice.

10:09.667 --> 10:11.666
I've been calling you, texting you.

10:11.667 --> 10:13.666
I wanted to answer, I swear I did.

10:13.667 --> 10:15.666
I spoke to my family back in Mexico.

10:15.667 --> 10:18.666
They warned me to stay away.

10:19.381 --> 10:21.666
Okay, does family mean drug people?

10:21.667 --> 10:23.666
Olivia...

10:23.667 --> 10:25.666
Yeah, see, that's weird.

10:25.974 --> 10:27.666
God, I'm a president's daughter.

10:27.667 --> 10:30.666
- You're a drug dealer.
- We are who we are.

10:30.909 --> 10:34.666
And I don't care what anybody
says, you are what I want.

10:35.365 --> 10:37.666
But how can you be so sure about us?

10:38.206 --> 10:40.666
I mean, Jesus, I don't even
know if I'm capable of love.

10:40.667 --> 10:42.666
Of course you are.

10:42.667 --> 10:45.666
Love is understanding. It is acceptance.

10:45.889 --> 10:49.085
And that is what you've shown me since
the moment we met at your ranch.

10:49.950 --> 10:51.666
Who knows what we are,

10:51.667 --> 10:55.666
but I will take the risk if you will.

11:03.667 --> 11:06.666
Working the phones, it's
the perfect next step, sir.

11:06.667 --> 11:09.666
- Jesus, it's another goddamn voice mail.
- Okay.

11:09.667 --> 11:11.980
W., Graves here.

11:11.981 --> 11:13.666
Listen, I need to talk to you.

11:13.667 --> 11:16.666
I'm having a hell of a time
down here over a highway.

11:16.667 --> 11:20.666
Kissinger, why, you old creep.

11:20.667 --> 11:22.939
Give a shout. I need to talk to you.

11:22.940 --> 11:25.666
Baker, Graves here.

11:25.667 --> 11:28.666
How you doing, James?
Please call me back. Bye-bye.

11:28.667 --> 11:32.666
You know, I really have a lot
of respect for James Baker,

11:32.667 --> 11:36.666
but he's not as connected
as he used to be.

11:36.667 --> 11:38.667
As in at all.

11:40.667 --> 11:41.942
I know what we do.

11:41.943 --> 11:43.873
Drive, we're going into town.

12:02.667 --> 12:06.667
It's like a convention for the
depressed by association.

12:10.312 --> 12:12.666
- Hmm, kill that smile.
- What?

12:12.667 --> 12:15.033
Every phone in here has a direct line

12:15.034 --> 12:17.242
to the loony bin down the road.

12:18.667 --> 12:21.667
Is everybody staying here visiting
someone at the insane asylum?

12:23.206 --> 12:25.102
Or they're about to check in.

12:25.127 --> 12:27.100
Fuck, fuck, let's talk marketing.

12:27.101 --> 12:30.666
You feeling down?
Do you know a convicted felon?

12:30.667 --> 12:35.140
Do you... do you enjoy the dulcet tones

12:35.141 --> 12:38.666
of desperate weeping
and psychotic screams?

12:39.931 --> 12:41.904
You are so offensive

12:42.667 --> 12:46.666
and yet somehow it's endearing.

12:46.667 --> 12:48.667
That's basically me in a nutshell.

12:50.667 --> 12:51.666
I'm Tasha.

12:51.667 --> 12:53.667
Jeremy.

12:55.667 --> 12:56.713
Mm.

12:58.054 --> 12:59.667
So who do you know on the inside?

13:00.667 --> 13:03.666
Do you remember that greengrocer

13:03.667 --> 13:07.667
from Ann Arbor, poisoned
all the ears of corn?

13:08.667 --> 13:10.320
The fucking Cornhusker?

13:10.992 --> 13:13.171
Always hated that name.

13:13.718 --> 13:16.666
Jesus. So many died.

13:16.667 --> 13:19.666
There was, like, the four
generations of that family

13:19.667 --> 13:21.666
at their big picnic reunion thing.

13:21.667 --> 13:23.051
Gone.

13:23.939 --> 13:28.667
That grocer is my sweet,
churchgoing dad.

13:31.667 --> 13:34.666
You know, my father murdered thousands.

13:34.667 --> 13:37.666
I mean, not directly, but still a
shitload of blood on his hands.

13:37.991 --> 13:40.423
You know, the fucked-up thing is

13:41.211 --> 13:45.666
Dad was on a day-to-day
basis a great dad.

13:46.303 --> 13:50.666
Sure, when he wasn't
poisoning people's corn.

13:51.263 --> 13:52.666
Yeah.

13:57.111 --> 13:59.666
With all the respect
in the world, Mr. President,

13:59.667 --> 14:02.666
I mean, what part of the title

14:02.667 --> 14:05.666
Deputy Assistant
Secretary of Transportation

14:05.667 --> 14:08.666
suggests to you that
I have any decision-making

14:08.667 --> 14:10.666
or changing powers?

14:10.667 --> 14:13.666
Don't bullshit me. You know
how to make decisions.

14:13.667 --> 14:16.666
You make a decision,
people jump on board.

14:16.667 --> 14:18.197
Yeah, the president's made some calls.

14:18.198 --> 14:19.666
Calls to some very important people.

14:19.667 --> 14:23.127
But clearly you understand
how the system works

14:23.128 --> 14:25.666
and we're under a bit of a time crunch.

14:25.667 --> 14:27.666
Now, I want to get this done fast.

14:27.667 --> 14:31.173
I don't want that
goddamn road in my name.

14:31.174 --> 14:35.666
People driving down the Richard
Graves Highway to Hell.

14:35.667 --> 14:38.666
The highway is a massive job creator

14:38.667 --> 14:40.666
and I can assure you, sir,

14:40.667 --> 14:43.666
that the Hennepaw
will be fairly compensated.

14:43.667 --> 14:45.666
It's eminent domain.

14:45.667 --> 14:50.666
We've eminent domained
an entire population

14:50.667 --> 14:52.293
out of their own country.

14:52.294 --> 14:56.666
And now we're chipping away
at what little they have left.

14:57.020 --> 14:59.023
Is that right, Nurbin?

14:59.333 --> 15:00.333
Is it?

15:03.964 --> 15:07.105
Make the call now.

15:08.322 --> 15:09.666
Well, shit.

15:09.667 --> 15:13.666
Ms. Graves, in February of 2013,

15:13.667 --> 15:16.666
did you intentionally
drive your Range Rover

15:16.667 --> 15:19.907
into Mr. Rockefeller's Aston Martin?

15:21.667 --> 15:22.666
Yes.

15:22.667 --> 15:25.666
And then in May of that same year,

15:25.667 --> 15:29.666
did you throw a priceless
Ming vase at my client

15:30.004 --> 15:33.666
because he declined your offer
to be intimate with you

15:33.969 --> 15:36.667
in a certain very painful position?

15:39.510 --> 15:40.666
Yes.

15:41.029 --> 15:42.666
And just last year,

15:42.667 --> 15:46.117
did you storm into
a boardroom in a negligee...

15:46.118 --> 15:49.666
Yes, okay? Yes, Gloria Allred.

15:49.667 --> 15:51.666
Yes to all of it.

15:51.667 --> 15:54.666
Judge, can I have a minute
to confer with my client?

15:54.667 --> 15:55.666
No, thank you, Jacob.

15:55.667 --> 15:57.667
- Okay, what are you doing?
- Ending this.

16:02.667 --> 16:05.138
Jesus, I mean, from the
moment I met you, Billy,

16:05.139 --> 16:06.948
I thought we were right for each other.

16:07.667 --> 16:11.399
Because we came from the
same place, the same things.

16:11.424 --> 16:14.666
We understood each other
like soldiers in a foxhole

16:14.667 --> 16:18.666
who get home from it all and realize
that they don't have anything in common.

16:18.667 --> 16:22.666
Neither of us really wanted this.

16:23.241 --> 16:25.041
It felt expected.

16:25.984 --> 16:27.666
And maybe you're right.

16:27.667 --> 16:30.135
Maybe I was incapable
of loving my husband.

16:30.136 --> 16:33.667
But loving him or anyone was
never really expected of me.

16:36.154 --> 16:38.050
But that's starting to change

16:40.018 --> 16:41.444
because you know what?

16:43.706 --> 16:45.666
Little Livy burned up in a fire

16:45.667 --> 16:47.998
and the soon to be ex-Mrs. Rockefeller

16:47.999 --> 16:49.666
is fucking a Mexican drug dealer

16:49.667 --> 16:53.666
for whom love is expected
and probably required.

16:54.425 --> 16:56.077
I'll sign whatever you want.

16:56.078 --> 16:57.666
And I don't want a penny of his money.

16:57.667 --> 17:00.666
Just be happy.

17:00.849 --> 17:02.667
Okay?

17:15.666 --> 17:17.666
The highway's a done deal.

17:19.246 --> 17:23.665
It'll pass right through your land, yes,

17:23.666 --> 17:26.665
but now with a higher payment.

17:26.666 --> 17:28.666
Twice as much.

17:43.989 --> 17:46.667
You say you want to help,
but you don't know how.

17:47.786 --> 17:50.666
If you are willing, I will show you.

18:00.667 --> 18:02.667
We drink the tea to summon the spirit.

18:04.667 --> 18:08.667
If you are true, the Creator
will show you the way.

18:10.667 --> 18:12.667
Oh.

18:13.667 --> 18:15.125
Thank you.

18:15.667 --> 18:17.667
Ooh, smells delicious.

18:19.667 --> 18:21.666
Oh, bitter. Funny.

18:21.667 --> 18:23.666
That's definitely not a chamomile.

18:23.667 --> 18:25.929
Is it a Chinese oolong, maybe?

18:26.667 --> 18:28.666
Interesting, though.

18:28.667 --> 18:30.666
Ooh, definitely nauseous.
That's curious.

18:30.667 --> 18:32.666
- Peyote.
- What?

18:32.667 --> 18:34.666
Jesus, peyote?!

18:34.667 --> 18:36.452
Sir, that's a schedule one narcotic.

18:36.453 --> 18:39.666
Of course. What the hell else
did you think this was about?

18:39.667 --> 18:41.666
Oh, my God!

18:41.667 --> 18:43.666
Mom? Mom, where...

18:43.667 --> 18:46.666
Oh, my God. Mom, breathe.

18:46.667 --> 18:48.666
Mom, come here. Just sit down.

18:48.667 --> 18:50.666
Keep breathing. Just breathe.

18:53.667 --> 18:56.666
Just like you always taught me.

19:00.667 --> 19:02.666
Okay. It's okay.

19:02.667 --> 19:05.666
I just think I ate something
that didn't agree with me.

19:05.667 --> 19:10.203
Or learning who your daughter really
is made you literally nauseous.

19:10.204 --> 19:11.666
Don't say things like that, Olivia.

19:11.667 --> 19:15.666
God damn it, I hate when you do that.
I know who you really are.

19:15.667 --> 19:18.666
Okay.

19:18.667 --> 19:19.667
I'm sorry.

19:21.667 --> 19:23.035
Well, you're a mess.

19:32.973 --> 19:35.666
Did I push you into that marriage?

19:36.330 --> 19:39.667
I mean, ish.

19:42.466 --> 19:44.465
Tell me how to help you.

19:44.667 --> 19:47.229
If I want something

19:47.230 --> 19:49.578
and it's important to me,

19:51.113 --> 19:53.113
then that has to be okay.

19:54.667 --> 19:57.667
Because otherwise
I'm never gonna be happy.

19:59.667 --> 20:01.667
I need to be free.

20:04.667 --> 20:05.991
Look...

20:08.667 --> 20:10.666
I know I was a total bitch about it,

20:10.667 --> 20:14.666
but I think you're gonna
be a kick-ass senator.

20:16.667 --> 20:20.666
So call that woman
in the sensible skirts...

20:20.667 --> 20:22.666
...and you tell her

20:22.667 --> 20:25.666
that your answer is hell fucking yes.

20:27.248 --> 20:29.666
Fight the man, Maggie.

20:35.667 --> 20:37.666
Hi.

20:37.667 --> 20:39.666
It wasn't oolong, Sammy.

20:39.667 --> 20:40.666
I mean, I only had a couple sips,

20:40.667 --> 20:42.666
but still it's a schedule one narcotic.

20:42.667 --> 20:45.666
I mean, I'll never pass
a high security clearance

20:45.667 --> 20:48.219
if I ever want to work
at the state department.

20:48.220 --> 20:49.666
I barely recognize myself, you know?

20:49.667 --> 20:52.921
I mean, I'm cuddling with this goat

20:53.667 --> 20:55.666
who seems to be okay with it, you know?

20:55.667 --> 20:57.666
Wait, wait, wait. A goat?

20:57.667 --> 20:59.666
Wait, what are you talking about?
Where are you?

20:59.667 --> 21:02.666
I don't know.

21:02.667 --> 21:07.666
I mean, maybe I could drop
a pin and you could come?

21:28.667 --> 21:31.132
Harlan Pratt.

21:32.667 --> 21:33.666
I knew you'd come.

21:39.667 --> 21:42.666
Sometimes the battle is already lost.

21:42.667 --> 21:46.666
Sometimes it's just standing on the side
of what is right that is important.

21:59.667 --> 22:01.667
Treadwell.

22:20.667 --> 22:22.667
I still can't believe this.

22:26.486 --> 22:28.895
I'm really sad, Sammy.

22:30.667 --> 22:32.572
Truth is,

22:33.667 --> 22:35.878
you should be sad, too.

22:36.667 --> 22:37.667
Why?

22:41.667 --> 22:43.666
You know why.

22:43.951 --> 22:46.666
Iz, just lay back down and we'll
wait this out together, okay?

22:46.667 --> 22:48.632
- Together?
- Yeah.

22:49.667 --> 22:51.667
We're never gonna be together.

22:54.138 --> 22:56.165
What?

22:56.166 --> 22:58.666
Iz, you're tripping.

22:59.137 --> 23:00.667
You don't get it.

23:02.097 --> 23:03.666
What... what is there to get?

23:03.667 --> 23:05.666
I thought we were just having fun.

23:05.667 --> 23:08.817
- I don't...
- Exactly, yeah, fun.

23:09.513 --> 23:11.512
We're never really gonna be together.

23:11.801 --> 23:13.666
I'm gonna be a congressman

23:13.667 --> 23:17.666
or a secretary of state
or even president, Sammy.

23:17.667 --> 23:20.666
All this, all this on you, the tattoos,

23:20.667 --> 23:24.666
you know, the piercings,
the life you've lived,

23:24.948 --> 23:27.667
the conservative world I live in.

23:28.826 --> 23:30.666
Come on.

23:33.810 --> 23:35.666
Are you serious right now?

23:36.220 --> 23:38.667
You know, what would people say?

23:43.667 --> 23:46.667
Here, keep drinking this
until you stop spinning.

23:48.667 --> 23:50.666
Wait, wait. Where are you going?

23:50.667 --> 23:51.667
Fuck you.

24:11.667 --> 24:15.666
This is the best mental hospital

24:15.667 --> 24:19.666
serial killer dad visit ever.

24:19.667 --> 24:21.219
Oh, man.

24:23.667 --> 24:26.666
Okay, so you seriously...

24:26.667 --> 24:28.666
you never knew who your dad was?

24:29.246 --> 24:30.246
Nope.

24:31.459 --> 24:32.714
Wow.

24:33.667 --> 24:35.666
I mean, yeah, I guess
I didn't always think

24:35.667 --> 24:37.960
my dad was a narcissistic
asshole either.

24:40.667 --> 24:42.666
So you're the angry man-child.

24:42.667 --> 24:44.666
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought
we'd been introduced.

24:44.667 --> 24:46.666
Yeah, that's me.

24:47.001 --> 24:49.666
"You will not be punished
for your anger,

24:50.241 --> 24:52.235
you will be punished by your anger."

24:52.236 --> 24:55.667
Come on, don't fucking
quote Buddha. God.

25:00.386 --> 25:02.385
You know, our fathers,

25:03.023 --> 25:05.666
they do what they can
with what they're given.

25:05.766 --> 25:07.667
You don't actually believe that, do you?

25:09.667 --> 25:10.666
I have to.

25:11.363 --> 25:12.666
Why?

25:12.667 --> 25:16.667
Because if it's not them, it's us.

25:18.667 --> 25:22.666
Do what's right tomorrow at
the Treadwell parole thing.

25:22.667 --> 25:24.666
Okay.

25:24.667 --> 25:26.666
Yeah, you want to tell me
what the hell that is?

25:28.317 --> 25:30.062
Whatever you need it to be.

25:36.928 --> 25:40.666
Russell, your father

25:40.667 --> 25:42.666
was a good man.

25:42.943 --> 25:45.070
You need to know this.

25:45.667 --> 25:50.330
And as far as the
government and this road,

25:50.355 --> 25:52.354
I have no power.

25:52.667 --> 25:56.154
But I can offer you something.

25:57.003 --> 25:58.666
I will stand with you

25:59.889 --> 26:02.091
against the giant.

26:09.667 --> 26:13.666
Freedom, kid... the absence of fear.

26:26.667 --> 26:28.666
In 1872,

26:28.667 --> 26:32.667
we consigned the Hennepaw
to this reservation.

26:33.667 --> 26:35.666
We took their land.

26:35.667 --> 26:38.666
We broke what spirit they had left.

26:38.667 --> 26:43.209
Now we're about to break
our last promise.

26:43.210 --> 26:47.666
So now I ask the government,

26:47.667 --> 26:49.666
which I once ran,

26:50.241 --> 26:53.666
to please take my goddamn name

26:53.667 --> 26:57.666
off this road and stop it.

27:09.667 --> 27:11.666
Despite peaceful
protests by the former president,

27:11.667 --> 27:14.666
construction will move
forward as planned.

27:14.667 --> 27:16.666
The one concession
the government has made

27:16.667 --> 27:19.666
is that they will remove
his name from the highway.

27:32.667 --> 27:34.666
I don't know how to spin this one.

27:34.667 --> 27:36.666
Margaret, your husband
looks like he's gone

27:36.667 --> 27:37.666
left-wing radical with what he's doing.

27:37.667 --> 27:39.666
I don't need you to tell me
what my husband's doing.

27:39.667 --> 27:41.666
You're here to advise me
what to do next.

27:41.667 --> 27:44.666
Tell me the right person
is standing beside me, Annie.

27:44.667 --> 27:47.667
- She is.
- Good.

27:48.667 --> 27:50.666
Here's what's gonna happen.

27:50.667 --> 27:52.666
Have Lawrence call Martin Bashir.

27:52.667 --> 27:56.666
Make Martin think it's his idea to do
a profile piece for "America 360."

27:56.667 --> 27:59.666
We are gonna manage the message
up until the exact moment

27:59.667 --> 28:02.116
I'm standing at a podium
to announce, understood?

28:02.136 --> 28:02.977
Uh-huh.

28:03.002 --> 28:05.666
You've been telling me for weeks now
this train has got to leave the station.

28:05.667 --> 28:07.590
Fine, we're leaving.

28:08.333 --> 28:10.332
And I'm driving.

28:23.405 --> 28:26.032
This guy's a monster, okay?

28:26.057 --> 28:28.666
He's a sick man who gave up his rights

28:28.667 --> 28:31.937
the moment he even thought about
pointing a gun at my father.

28:32.667 --> 28:34.666
The fact that I was just a little boy,

28:34.667 --> 28:38.162
that I witnessed it,
that's just collateral damage.

28:38.667 --> 28:41.666
His mother shouldn't die
thinking that what he did

28:41.667 --> 28:43.060
was in any way her fault.

28:43.400 --> 28:44.844
She did nothing wrong.

28:45.313 --> 28:48.312
So let him tell her that.

28:48.884 --> 28:50.667
Let him give her some peace.

28:51.667 --> 28:52.770
Ahem.

28:53.667 --> 28:57.666
And then stick a fucking needle
in his arm, please.
