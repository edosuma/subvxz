00:18.084 --> 00:20.419

    those bracelets on you?

            [sighs]

00:37.103 --> 00:38.670
     We got maurice owens,
        so that's good.

00:38.672 --> 00:40.272
       - If you'd waited,
    we'd have him for a hell

00:40.274 --> 00:41.573
  Of a lot more than bribery.

00:41.575 --> 00:43.742
        - Yeah, I know,
        but it was time,

00:43.744 --> 00:46.211
        Don't you think?
  - Yeah, you made your point.

00:46.213 --> 00:48.647
        You're the boss,

00:48.649 --> 00:51.316
         Until the tide
         washes you out

00:51.318 --> 00:54.053
       And they bring in
       your replacement.

00:54.055 --> 00:56.288
    - How's detective sumner
    fitting into your unit?

00:56.290 --> 00:59.324
        - Why don't you
       ask her yourself?

00:59.326 --> 01:01.126
  - She's not working for me,

01:01.128 --> 01:02.528
         If that's what
       you're getting at.

01:02.530 --> 01:06.432
      She's just a friend.
    Question: Jay halstead.

01:06.434 --> 01:08.200
    You know anything about

01:08.202 --> 01:09.501
     This restraining order
          against him?

01:09.503 --> 01:12.171
    - I go after criminals,
           not cops.

01:12.173 --> 01:13.505
    - That deal has changed.

01:20.280 --> 01:21.480
           You know,
   recently my doctor put me

01:21.482 --> 01:24.850
      And when I asked him
 how long I had to stay on it,

01:24.852 --> 01:26.251
            He said
    for the rest of my life.

01:26.253 --> 01:28.253
  - I'm not big on analogies.

01:28.255 --> 01:30.355
- Think of our new relationship
       like my new diet.

01:30.357 --> 01:33.625
       It goes on forever
         until you die.

01:33.627 --> 01:36.161
         - What happens
      if you die first...

01:40.767 --> 01:43.402
         From that diet
    your doctor put you on?

01:50.143 --> 01:52.544
            - You do
     what I tell you to do,

01:52.546 --> 01:54.613
       Or we'll take away
          your badge,

01:54.615 --> 01:55.781
       And you'll go back
           to prison.

01:55.783 --> 01:57.382
     You have five minutes
         to let me know

01:57.384 --> 01:59.351
           Which way
     you want to play this.

02:04.491 --> 02:06.391
       - Hey, you finish
        the report yet?

02:06.393 --> 02:08.827
        - How many years
 until you actually contribute

02:08.829 --> 02:10.262
        To one of these?
  - I told you what to write,

02:10.264 --> 02:14.366
           Didn't I?
 - Yup. How's this look so far?

02:16.136 --> 02:18.704
So anything we should take away
       from our sergeant

02:18.706 --> 02:20.339
   Being arrested last night?

02:20.341 --> 02:21.640
          - No, it was
      a misunderstanding.

02:21.642 --> 02:23.475
     - He was put in cuffs
    for a misunderstanding?

02:23.477 --> 02:26.278
      - They released him.
       It was a mistake.

02:26.280 --> 02:28.147
    Just finish the report.

02:28.149 --> 02:29.615
     [cell phone vibrates]

02:29.617 --> 02:32.451
           - Al, no.

02:32.453 --> 02:33.685
       Give me my phone.

02:33.687 --> 02:35.554
          - You know,
 you should celebrate the ease

02:35.556 --> 02:37.823
     With which you procure
          such images,

02:37.825 --> 02:41.693
I used to dry out wet <i> penthouses</i>
   that I found in the woods.

02:41.695 --> 02:43.328
     - Well, that's gross.

02:43.330 --> 02:45.264
  Listen, those are wendy, al.

02:45.266 --> 02:48.400
      You're not supposed
         to see those.

02:48.402 --> 02:50.169
         - Your fiancee
        sends you these?

02:50.171 --> 02:52.804
       - Okay, all right.
       What--what--what--

02:52.806 --> 02:54.506
      What if you lose it?
   - You can't see her face.

02:54.508 --> 02:56.708
    Nobody'd know it's her.
        - But you would.

02:56.710 --> 02:58.744
           - [sighs]
      we got into a fight.

02:58.746 --> 03:02.381
        This is her way
     of making it up to me.

03:02.383 --> 03:03.849
       Give me my phone.

03:08.288 --> 03:09.421
        [static hisses]

03:09.423 --> 03:12.858
       - B2113, come in.
          - Go ahead.

03:12.860 --> 03:15.961
 - Multiple reports of gunfire
  at 17th and morgan viaduct.

03:15.963 --> 03:18.397
Shots came from the first floor.

03:18.399 --> 03:20.232
            - 10-4.
           En route.

03:24.271 --> 03:27.272
      [people chattering]

03:27.274 --> 03:28.540
      - Out the back door.

03:32.812 --> 03:34.980
    - Let's see what we got.

03:36.482 --> 03:38.850
   - Don't go away on us yet.

03:38.852 --> 03:42.254
      - Hit in the chest.
 Bullet just missed the heart.

03:42.256 --> 03:44.389
      - Any other victims?
       - Just a witness.

03:45.692 --> 03:47.392
       - Can you tell me
         what happened?

03:47.394 --> 03:49.228
      How many were there?

03:49.230 --> 03:51.563
    - Hang on there, buddy.
        Try to breathe.

03:51.565 --> 03:54.333
          - Hey, lexi.
      Do you remember us?

03:54.335 --> 03:56.001
   We met a couple times down
        at the district.

03:56.003 --> 03:58.270
      I'm officer burgess.
    This is officer atwater.

03:58.272 --> 03:59.571
      - You guys know her?
         - Yeah, yeah.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.306
         She's the kid
   of one of our detectives.

04:01.308 --> 04:03.008
   - Mind if we talk to her?

04:03.010 --> 04:05.444
           - Thanks.

04:05.446 --> 04:07.713
      Honey, are you okay?

04:07.715 --> 04:09.481
      - I saw the shooter.

04:11.317 --> 04:12.851
           - My baby.

04:12.853 --> 04:15.254
        What did they do
          to my baby?

04:15.256 --> 04:16.521
            My baby!
           [sobbing]

04:16.523 --> 04:17.956
        - Let's get her
          out of here.

04:24.998 --> 04:27.432
         - She's okay.
      She's just in shock.

04:27.434 --> 04:30.369
       - Care to explain
what happened to you last night?

04:30.371 --> 04:31.370
      - I got it handled.

04:31.372 --> 04:32.704
        - Everyone knows
        you got pinched.

04:32.706 --> 04:34.473
             - And?

04:35.441 --> 04:38.277
   Hey, how you doing, kiddo?

04:38.279 --> 04:39.778
       - Hi, uncle hank.

04:41.681 --> 04:43.582
           - My god.

04:45.351 --> 04:49.488
              Hey.
      - I'm so sorry, dad.

04:49.490 --> 04:52.324
        - What happened?
      - I was at a party.

04:52.326 --> 04:55.360
         - Until dawn?
   Does mom know you're here?

04:55.362 --> 04:56.361
            - Yeah.
       - What did you do?

04:56.363 --> 04:57.429
         You sneak out?
          - Sergeant.

04:57.431 --> 04:59.931
         - Someone here
   from gang unit to see you.

04:59.933 --> 05:01.400
    It's about the shooting
           in pilsen.

05:01.402 --> 05:02.634
          - All right,
      I'll be right down.

05:02.636 --> 05:03.935
           All right,
     why don't you take her

05:03.937 --> 05:06.505
   For a cup of hot chocolate
         or something?

05:06.507 --> 05:08.907
          - It's okay.
   Hey, she doesn't testify.

05:08.909 --> 05:10.075
           - I know.
         - To anything.

05:10.077 --> 05:11.977
           I mean it.

05:11.979 --> 05:13.512
          - I got it.

05:15.481 --> 05:17.849
          - All right.
           All right.

05:29.529 --> 05:29.761
               .

05:29.763 --> 05:33.432
    He's a low-level runner
          for the gang

05:33.434 --> 05:34.666
      The "g" park lords.

05:34.668 --> 05:37.936
       We're running into
 a p.C.P. Operation in pilsen.

05:37.938 --> 05:39.805
      - What is he, c.I.?
             - No.

05:39.807 --> 05:41.773
    We just got eyes on him.

05:41.775 --> 05:44.109
 Lords have been making a push
   into latin gang territory,

05:44.111 --> 05:45.811
       So the shooting's
       probably a message

05:45.813 --> 05:47.713
       To the black gangs
    to keep off their turf.

05:47.715 --> 05:49.414
       - What's this got
         to do with us?

05:49.416 --> 05:50.916
     - I heard the witness
       was brought here.

05:50.918 --> 05:53.085
     - There is no witness.

05:53.087 --> 05:55.654
        - That's funny.

05:55.656 --> 05:57.422
       Two other officers
      said that there was,

05:57.424 --> 06:00.726
     And that her last name
          was olinsky.

06:02.061 --> 06:04.930
    Look, I understand, man.

06:04.932 --> 06:08.567
        - Look, you know
as well as I do these witnesses

06:08.569 --> 06:10.802
        Who come forward
       in gang shootings

06:10.804 --> 06:12.404
    Become walking targets.

06:12.406 --> 06:14.806
- Detective, we've been working
     this case for months.

06:14.808 --> 06:17.743
  How long you've been working
         on this case.

06:17.745 --> 06:19.945
   What I'm telling you is--
        - alvin. Alvin!

06:23.550 --> 06:28.854
Intelligence is gonna run point
       on this shooting.

06:28.856 --> 06:30.789
     - You can't take this
  investigation away from me.

06:30.791 --> 06:33.925
         - I just did.
    - 'cause of one witness?

06:33.927 --> 06:35.026
       Commander perry--

06:35.028 --> 06:36.995
         - I will talk
      to commander perry.

06:50.476 --> 06:52.644
   Just let me handle it, al.
            - Yeah.

06:55.882 --> 07:00.685
   - What was that all about?

07:00.687 --> 07:02.187
      - Call everybody in.

07:02.189 --> 07:04.923
       We got a gang hit
           to solve.

07:07.927 --> 07:10.796
      - I only met russell
        a couple times.

07:10.798 --> 07:13.198
    He's a really nice guy.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.734
     He offered to walk me
         to the train.

07:15.736 --> 07:17.569
         - Did you know
     that he was in a gang?

07:17.571 --> 07:21.072
  - He was always cool to me.

07:21.074 --> 07:24.176
       - So what happened
         in the alley?

07:24.178 --> 07:26.611
     - Um, the guy came up.

07:26.613 --> 07:29.881
        Russell and him
        started arguing.

07:29.883 --> 07:32.017
         - About what?

07:32.019 --> 07:35.053
   - He told russell, "you're
  in the wrong neighborhood."

07:35.055 --> 07:37.222
            The guy
    was totally gakked out.

07:37.224 --> 07:39.958
  - Did you get a name, or...

07:39.960 --> 07:43.495
       - I heard russell
        call him calaca?

07:43.497 --> 07:45.697
            - Okay.
    Come on, let's go home.

07:45.699 --> 07:46.765
           Let's go.
            Come on.

07:46.767 --> 07:47.966
    - She's just walking me
          through it.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.067
       - You got a name,
          didn't you?

07:49.069 --> 07:51.236
     Did you get your name?

07:51.238 --> 07:52.804
            Come on.
     Let's get out of here.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.539
             - Bye.

07:57.844 --> 08:00.679
   - Calaca means "skeleton"
          in spanish.

08:00.681 --> 08:01.947
           My money's
     on the latin priests.

08:01.949 --> 08:03.782
    That's the kind of name
     they give their boys.

08:03.784 --> 08:05.817
    - Neighbors don't claim
     to have seen anything.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.486
         - And there's
  no security cameras either.

08:07.488 --> 08:08.987
   - Shift's already started.
        Where you been?

08:08.989 --> 08:11.189
   The report you requested,
           sergeant.

08:11.191 --> 08:12.557
          A breakdown
   of all drug-related busts

08:12.559 --> 08:14.125
       In the pilsen area
     in the last 12 months.

08:14.127 --> 08:15.794
      - How many files did
    you have to go through?

08:15.796 --> 08:18.530
- All right, now give me a list
  of all gang-affiliated males

08:18.532 --> 08:20.665
      In the neighborhood
that were arrested with a weapon

08:20.667 --> 08:22.868
            Who were
     between 5'2" and 6'3".

08:22.870 --> 08:26.137
        - Gunman's 5'9".
- You can never be too careful.

08:28.908 --> 08:30.709
           All right,
     let's find this calaca

08:30.711 --> 08:33.678
      And get a confession
so lexi doesn't have to testify.

08:33.679 --> 08:35.914
    Use any means necessary.

08:35.916 --> 08:37.916
    - How you even associate
       with these people

08:37.918 --> 08:38.783
        I have no idea.

08:38.784 --> 08:40.085
       - Russell's mom--

08:40.087 --> 08:43.688
      She screamed so loud
       when she saw him.

08:43.690 --> 08:45.824
 - You know, you're just lucky
         it wasn't you.

08:45.826 --> 08:47.893
       - What if russell
        doesn't make it?

08:47.895 --> 08:48.793
       - He's in a gang.

08:48.795 --> 08:51.863
   That's the price you pay.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.532
        Stay right here.
           All right?

08:53.534 --> 08:55.967
          Don't move.

08:55.969 --> 08:58.970
         Hey, atwater.

08:58.972 --> 09:00.238
          - What's up?

09:00.240 --> 09:01.973
   - Let me see your notepad.

09:04.677 --> 09:07.078
             Yeah.

09:07.080 --> 09:10.982
        If anyone asks,
you lost your crime scene notes.

09:10.984 --> 09:13.218
         - I could get
 in some pretty serious trouble

09:13.220 --> 09:14.886
         If the courts
    come looking for those.

09:14.888 --> 09:17.122
  - Yeah, that's your problem.

09:17.124 --> 09:20.091
        Come on, honey.
            Come on.

09:20.093 --> 09:22.761
    - I didn't see anything.

09:22.763 --> 09:25.664
      - It was your house.
      How's that possible?

09:25.666 --> 09:29.668
  Kenneth, now's not the time
          to get shy.

09:29.670 --> 09:34.172
     - I was in my bedroom
          with a girl.

09:34.174 --> 09:36.274
       - You always hang
       with gangbangers?

09:36.276 --> 09:38.276
  - Well, it's not like that.
     It's the neighborhood.

09:38.278 --> 09:41.613
      Everybody's welcome.

09:41.615 --> 09:45.116
 - Russell had 20 wicky sticks
    on him when he was shot.

09:45.118 --> 09:46.651
       Now, don't tell me
        you didn't know

09:46.653 --> 09:48.887
        There were drugs
         at your party.

09:48.889 --> 09:51.756
    - Russell sells us weed
           sometimes.

09:51.758 --> 09:53.992
          But p.C.P.?
    No, not that I ever saw.

10:00.333 --> 10:02.601
            - Okay.

10:04.704 --> 10:06.071
          - This kid's
      as soft as a daisy.

10:06.073 --> 10:08.940
 There's no way he's affiliated
          with a gang.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.308
     - Maybe russell's mom
        knows something.

10:10.310 --> 10:11.943
          - Is no one
   gonna talk about the fact

10:11.945 --> 10:13.845
    That voight got arrested
          last night?

10:13.847 --> 10:16.181
     - He was put in cuffs
       once before by me.

10:16.183 --> 10:17.983
           He got out
     of those pretty easy.

10:17.985 --> 10:19.884
      Why should this time
       be any different?

10:19.886 --> 10:21.086
       - Wait, so let me
       get this straight.

10:21.088 --> 10:23.855
        The rule of law
    doesn't apply to voight?

10:23.857 --> 10:25.223
       Just so I'm clear.

10:25.225 --> 10:28.393
      - Just do your job.

10:28.395 --> 10:30.729
 - So what's the scoop, sarge?
   - Yeah, what's the scoop?

10:30.731 --> 10:32.631
   - If voight got arrested,
     what were the charges?

10:32.633 --> 10:34.933
 - Yeah, they're not gonna take
 the unit from him, will they?

10:34.935 --> 10:38.737
 - You're like two washerwomen
     from the old country.

10:38.739 --> 10:41.072
Why don't you take your laundry
       down to the river?

10:41.074 --> 10:42.907
         - Hey, listen.
         Come with me.

10:42.909 --> 10:45.076
       We need her today.
        - What about me?

10:45.078 --> 10:46.911
       - You don't really
        have the curves

10:46.913 --> 10:47.912
   I'm looking for, atwater.

10:47.914 --> 10:50.949
          Sorry, man.

10:50.951 --> 10:53.652
            - Well,
 now that you're partnerless--

10:53.654 --> 10:55.687
      - Sarge, not today.
    Can't I just ride alone?

10:55.689 --> 10:57.989
        - Hey, peterson,
      found you a partner

10:57.991 --> 11:01.860
   Until matthewson gets back
         from furlough.

11:01.862 --> 11:03.962
      Have a blessed day.

11:10.436 --> 11:12.704
             Hank.
           - Not now.

11:12.706 --> 11:14.839
        - Lexi olinsky.

11:14.841 --> 11:17.876
       Now you got time.

11:17.878 --> 11:19.911
         I was talking
      to the desk sergeant

11:19.913 --> 11:22.180
       Over at the 27th.

11:22.182 --> 11:24.315
        Detective stark
      was seen questioning

11:24.317 --> 11:26.151
     The other two uniforms
         at the scene.

11:26.153 --> 11:27.452
    Thought you should know.

11:27.454 --> 11:29.054
        Try to stay out
      of handcuffs today.

11:29.056 --> 11:32.223
  It's getting hard to explain
        to the kiddies.

11:34.960 --> 11:37.195
      - Okay, we've known
          for a while

11:37.197 --> 11:38.997
    That the latin priests--
      they use white kids,

11:38.999 --> 11:41.766
       Steal smart phones
  up and down michigan avenue

11:41.768 --> 11:44.235
   All the way from mag mile
   to millennium park, right?

11:44.237 --> 11:46.905
     - Yeah, yeah, I mean,
especially from female tourists.

11:49.108 --> 11:50.308
    I could play a tourist.

11:50.310 --> 11:51.476
        - You could play
          the tourist.

11:51.478 --> 11:53.912
   Can't get anything by you.
            - Okay.

11:53.914 --> 11:57.048
   So, all right, why are we
  targeting the latin priests?

11:57.050 --> 11:59.250
 - Well, it looks like the guy
  that shot russell thompson,

11:59.252 --> 12:02.487
 Now, if these guys were never
     big players in pilsen,

12:02.489 --> 12:04.289
         They just had
      the cell phone ring.

12:04.291 --> 12:05.790
           It's still
     their bread and butter

12:05.792 --> 12:07.325
        Even if they are
       moving into p.C.P.

12:07.327 --> 12:09.360
    Cracking the cell phone
   operation to get to him--

12:09.362 --> 12:11.129
       It's a long shot,
       but at this stage,

12:11.131 --> 12:12.864
        Anything to keep
    al's daughter out of it

12:12.866 --> 12:15.734
     Is worth looking into.
            - Yeah.

12:15.736 --> 12:19.270
   - So put a tracker in it.

12:19.272 --> 12:20.739
       Be gentle with it.

12:20.741 --> 12:22.907
            Please.

12:22.909 --> 12:24.209
    - Welcome to undercover.

12:24.211 --> 12:27.011
     - Welcome to the bigs.

12:27.013 --> 12:29.848
         - That's cute.
  You think I'm here for you?

12:29.850 --> 12:30.882
          - [chuckles]

12:30.884 --> 12:33.251
            Come on.
     Let's go get changed.

12:43.028 --> 12:44.863
       - Lonnie rodiger's
          credit card.

12:44.865 --> 12:47.332
        - Yeah, I know.
  Working on the court order.

12:47.334 --> 12:50.902
    - Another hit came back
from a humboldt park home depot.

12:50.904 --> 12:54.339
He purchased a two-person tent,
   kerosene lamp, bug spray.

12:54.341 --> 12:55.774
    - So he's going camping.

12:55.776 --> 12:57.542
        - And some rope
         and duct tape.

13:05.518 --> 13:07.152
       - How's he doing?

13:07.154 --> 13:09.487
  - They won't really tell me,

13:09.489 --> 13:12.924
     And I get the feeling
      that can't be good.

13:12.926 --> 13:14.492
     - Russell ever mention
        having a problem

13:14.494 --> 13:16.494
  With someone called calaca?

13:16.496 --> 13:20.165
       - I've never heard
       that name before.

13:20.167 --> 13:23.234
  - How long has russell been
    running with the lords?

13:23.236 --> 13:25.236
     - He had drugs on him,
           didn't he?

13:27.339 --> 13:29.140
            T-mac--

13:29.142 --> 13:31.576
         I told russell
     to stay away from him.

13:31.578 --> 13:33.011
            - T-mac?

13:33.013 --> 13:36.414
       - Tamarcus pierce.
     Russell worships him.

13:36.416 --> 13:39.918
   Thugs like that have a way
 of dragging the young ones in.

13:54.366 --> 13:57.035
         - Shots fired.
         Harrison park.

13:57.037 --> 14:00.004
      - 10-4, responding.

14:01.373 --> 14:04.442
        [siren wailing]

14:09.615 --> 14:11.983
    They were killed nearby
        and dumped here.

14:11.985 --> 14:13.418
          I recognize
       a couple of them.

14:13.420 --> 14:15.987
      They're all members
     of the latin priests.

14:15.989 --> 14:18.857
       - Retaliation hit
          for russell.

14:18.859 --> 14:22.060
        - This just went
 from a gang hit to a gang war.

14:29.935 --> 14:30.168
               .

14:30.170 --> 14:34.105
           Displayed
       on a soccer field.

14:34.107 --> 14:36.174
   It was a reprisal shooting
     for russell thompson,

14:36.176 --> 14:38.309
             Member
      of the g-park lords.

14:38.311 --> 14:41.613
- Russell was a low-level runner
       for t-mac pierce.

14:41.615 --> 14:43.181
      - I remember t-mac.

14:43.183 --> 14:45.250
    Yeah, we used to answer
    domestic violence calls

14:45.252 --> 14:46.918
          All the time
        at his mother's.

14:46.920 --> 14:49.120
      His stepfather beat
      the crap out of him.

14:49.122 --> 14:50.154
    - What are you wearing?

14:50.156 --> 14:51.956
         - I'm supposed
        to be a tourist.

14:51.958 --> 14:54.158
        - It's working.
      - I brought her up.

14:54.160 --> 14:57.462
     I figured we could use
   all the help we could get.

14:57.464 --> 15:00.298
   - All right, t-mac pierce.
     It's a place to start.

15:00.300 --> 15:01.966
      - What about calaca?
         - You tell me.

15:01.968 --> 15:03.134
      - I've got word out
        to all my c.I.S.

15:03.136 --> 15:05.970
  - Priests probably have him
           in hiding.

15:05.972 --> 15:07.205
- Well, maybe t-mac knows where.

15:07.207 --> 15:08.606
   He had no problem finding
        four of his pals

15:08.608 --> 15:11.242
        And putting lead
         in their head.

15:11.244 --> 15:14.412
       Ruzek, my office.

15:23.255 --> 15:25.323
      - What's up, sarge?

15:25.325 --> 15:28.226
  - Who gave you the authority
   to call up a uniform, hmm?

15:28.228 --> 15:30.128
    - Sir, lexi said calaca
     was the one that shot

15:30.130 --> 15:31.663
    Russell thompson, right?

15:31.665 --> 15:33.197
         He's hooked up
    with the latin priests.

15:33.199 --> 15:35.199
            They're
    in the cell phone game.

15:35.201 --> 15:37.669
I think that this is a good way
     for us to get to him.

15:37.671 --> 15:40.204
           The phones
 are largely stolen from women.

15:40.206 --> 15:43.174
   I think she can handle it,
           sergeant.

15:43.176 --> 15:45.209
          It's just--

15:45.211 --> 15:47.545
   We got to play every angle
        on this, right?

15:47.547 --> 15:50.181
     Let me play this one.

15:50.183 --> 15:52.016
       It's for olinsky.

15:54.119 --> 15:55.687
           - Beat it.
     - Sergeant, I really--

15:55.689 --> 15:59.324
   - I didn't say no, did I?

16:05.431 --> 16:06.998
            Remember
     when we first started

16:07.000 --> 16:08.333
    And I told you sometimes
         you might have

16:08.335 --> 16:11.102
       To do some things
         off the books?

16:11.104 --> 16:16.007
      - Yeah, I remember.
   - That only applied to me.

16:16.009 --> 16:18.643
       What did halstead
       come to you about?

16:28.487 --> 16:30.755
 - This'll only take a minute.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.534
             - Oh--

16:43.536 --> 16:45.336
        - You scope out
     your next victim yet?

16:45.338 --> 16:47.105
         - I don't know
   what you're talking about.

16:47.107 --> 16:48.740
 - Maybe you can alibi him out
      after this one too.

16:48.742 --> 16:50.641
  - Just get off my property!
     - Yeah, call the cops.

16:50.643 --> 16:55.346
 - He bought duct tape and rope
   up the street last night.

16:55.348 --> 16:57.115
          You remember
   how they found ben corson?

16:57.117 --> 16:58.316
- What, are you monitoring him?

16:58.318 --> 17:00.184
   - Your son is a pedophile
         and a killer!

17:00.186 --> 17:02.253
            - Leave.

17:18.303 --> 17:21.204
        - What was that?
         - Just drive.

17:32.484 --> 17:36.154
  - Hey, how about next time,
  I get to pick the team, huh?

17:36.156 --> 17:37.321
        How about that?

17:37.323 --> 17:38.790
         - What's wrong
     with the blue jackets?

17:38.792 --> 17:40.324
         They're, like,
       my favorite team.

17:40.326 --> 17:42.226
    Besides, think you look
         kind of cute.

17:42.228 --> 17:45.229
    That little fanny pack's
   kind of the cherry on top.

17:45.231 --> 17:46.831
           [chuckles]

17:59.545 --> 18:01.212
             - Hey!

18:01.214 --> 18:04.449
            Really?
         Super awesome.

18:04.451 --> 18:05.616
          - Nice work.

18:05.618 --> 18:07.718
          Bait taken.

18:07.720 --> 18:09.720
          Go, jackets.

18:09.722 --> 18:13.157
         - Go, jackets.

18:13.159 --> 18:14.258
          - You've got
       to be kidding me!

18:14.260 --> 18:16.561
      Are you kidding me?
         You're nothing

18:16.563 --> 18:18.296
   But a big fat, lazy slob.
           - Shut up!

18:18.298 --> 18:20.264
     - That's what you are.
     You know that, right?

18:20.266 --> 18:22.333
        I can't believe
   it's your brilliant idea.

18:22.335 --> 18:25.870
     - Go ahead, alphonse.
   Burn your own house down!

18:25.872 --> 18:27.705
   - Sir, put the flare down.

18:27.707 --> 18:29.273
           - Look...
           [panting]

18:29.275 --> 18:33.511
           What this
   horrible person did to me.

18:33.513 --> 18:34.745
    - Sir, whatever you do,

18:34.747 --> 18:36.814
    Do not remove the knife
        from your neck.

18:36.816 --> 18:38.282
       Ma'am, stand back!

18:38.284 --> 18:39.617
             Ma'am!
  - We should call for backup.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.419
     - You'll be in flames
            by then.

18:41.421 --> 18:43.421
            [grunts]

18:46.358 --> 18:48.192
             - No.
            - Ma'am!

18:48.194 --> 18:51.395
     Drop the knife, ma'am.
             - Ugh!

18:55.701 --> 18:58.402
 - At least call an ambulance,
           peterson.

19:00.305 --> 19:04.175
           - Minute?

19:04.177 --> 19:08.146
      - Russell thompson--
         he just died.

19:08.148 --> 19:09.714
     - Sorry to hear that.

19:09.716 --> 19:11.916
      - Olinsky's daughter
   saw the guy who shot him.

19:11.918 --> 19:14.552
           Right now,
   she's our only eyewitness.

19:14.554 --> 19:16.888
       She mis-remembered
         a few things.

19:16.890 --> 19:19.323
           - Save it.

19:19.325 --> 19:21.692
  When I heard the only other
witness was alvin's little girl,

19:21.694 --> 19:23.528
       My heart dropped.

19:23.530 --> 19:26.330
      Last time I saw her,
    she was about yay high,

19:26.332 --> 19:29.333
     And she's just running
      up and down the hall

19:29.335 --> 19:32.937
 In these little pink overalls
         and pigtails.

19:35.741 --> 19:38.342
       If you don't catch
   the shooter without lexi,

19:38.344 --> 19:40.278
          We're gonna
        have to use her.

19:40.280 --> 19:43.281
     - I'm not comfortable
           with that.

19:43.283 --> 19:45.516
       - That's too bad,

19:45.518 --> 19:48.419
      'cause there's been
         a development.

19:50.656 --> 19:52.857
        [knock on door]

19:57.262 --> 19:59.297
            - Hank.

19:59.299 --> 20:00.798
      - Just checking in.

20:00.800 --> 20:04.335
        - I doubt that.

20:04.337 --> 20:05.536
             - Hey.

20:07.340 --> 20:10.374
    - Lexi, why don't you go
         to your room?

20:10.376 --> 20:12.476
        - How's russell?

20:15.480 --> 20:16.881
      He's dead, isn't he?

20:16.883 --> 20:19.250
        - Is that true?

20:19.252 --> 20:20.251
          - Afraid so.

20:20.253 --> 20:22.753
     - Oh, god, I knew it.

20:22.755 --> 20:24.355
  Are you gonna catch the guy
         who shot him,

20:24.357 --> 20:25.723
   The one I told you about?

20:25.725 --> 20:28.626
 - Didn't your mother tell you
      to go to your room?

20:28.628 --> 20:31.629
           Right now.
           - Come on.

20:33.232 --> 20:36.400
     - You have to get him.

20:39.438 --> 20:42.373
          - All right.
        What's going on?

20:42.375 --> 20:45.276
- The two officers on the scene
     before our two guys--

20:45.278 --> 20:47.545
  Stark had them file a report
   with the state's attorney.

20:47.547 --> 20:51.015
 - They were doing their jobs.
   - I can find them myself.

20:51.017 --> 20:53.651
    - Alvin, it's too late.
- She can't testify, all right?

20:53.653 --> 20:55.386
      A subpoena will put
    a bull's-eye out on her.

20:55.388 --> 20:57.722
    - Not if we find calaca
  and get a confession first.

20:57.724 --> 21:00.391
           - Captain,
    we got t-mac in pocket.

21:00.393 --> 21:03.661
   - I'm going with you, man.
   - No, you're staying here.

21:03.663 --> 21:04.996
          Did lexi say
       she knows calaca?

21:04.998 --> 21:06.731
           - She said
  she's never seen him before.

21:06.733 --> 21:08.733
   - Well, so he doesn't know
      where you guys live.

21:08.735 --> 21:10.568
       - That's the hope.

21:10.570 --> 21:13.871
          - Stay here.
      Protect your family.

21:15.574 --> 21:16.974
          - [whispers]
             yeah.

21:16.976 --> 21:19.043
        Yeah, all right.
           All right.

21:19.045 --> 21:21.279
         [radio beeps]
        - I'm on my way.

21:30.289 --> 21:31.889
           - Stairs!

21:34.026 --> 21:36.027
       - I got two here!

21:36.029 --> 21:37.061
           It's okay.
           It's okay.

21:37.063 --> 21:39.764
            - Clear!
            - Clear!

21:39.766 --> 21:40.965
       - Check the back.

21:41.933 --> 21:43.834
            - Clear!
      - Where's tamarcus?

21:43.836 --> 21:46.037
        - How many times
  do I have to tell you people

21:46.039 --> 21:47.838
  Tamarcus does not live here?

21:47.840 --> 21:51.742
      - Where's tamarcus?
      - Hold on, hold on.

21:51.744 --> 21:53.477
      We're not gonna hurt
         your brother.

21:53.479 --> 21:56.347
   Can you tell me, sweetie,
          where he is?

21:56.349 --> 21:58.082
           It's okay.

21:58.084 --> 21:59.583
            Come on.

21:59.585 --> 22:01.085
          Where is he?

22:01.087 --> 22:03.020
     Where's your brother?

22:03.022 --> 22:05.589
          - Upstairs.

22:05.591 --> 22:07.358
          - Very good.

22:07.360 --> 22:09.026
           - Lindsay.

22:21.840 --> 22:24.909
      [automatic gunfire]

22:33.051 --> 22:33.484
               .

22:33.486 --> 22:35.486
      [automatic gunfire]

22:38.890 --> 22:41.959
           [gunfire]

22:46.431 --> 22:49.133
       - Runner outside.
             T-mac!

22:51.870 --> 22:54.939
     - What the--I got him.
      You stay with them.

23:08.488 --> 23:13.057
 Real low-grade to be shooting
      at cops over, t-mac.

23:13.059 --> 23:14.892
        - Hipsters like
      what hipsters like.

23:14.894 --> 23:17.395
        - You ever heard
of a latin priest called calaca?

23:17.397 --> 23:19.163
  - Guess I ain't the only one
        looking for him.

23:19.165 --> 23:20.965
  - You're just gonna take out
      his crew one by one

23:20.967 --> 23:22.800
      Until you find him.

23:22.802 --> 23:24.635
       That's your plan?

23:24.637 --> 23:26.437
    You're gonna pull back.

23:26.439 --> 23:29.673
          Let us find
       calaca ourselves.

23:31.543 --> 23:34.545
           - [sighs]

23:34.547 --> 23:36.580
            No, man.

23:36.582 --> 23:38.983
       Calaca's gonna get
      what he got coming.

23:42.587 --> 23:46.056
          - What now?

23:46.058 --> 23:48.459
    - Those arrest reports.
             - Mm.

23:48.461 --> 23:50.661
     - I also did a search
    on t-mac's mom's house.

23:50.663 --> 23:54.632
  The entire thing was bought
 with cash linked to narcotics.

23:54.634 --> 23:57.701
   You ever heard of an asset
   forfeiture seizure order?

24:02.507 --> 24:04.442
    - I'm supposed to guess
         what that is?

24:04.444 --> 24:10.147
 - Property forfeiture document
   freshly signed by a judge.

24:10.149 --> 24:12.850
 You bought your mother's house
        with drug money.

24:15.787 --> 24:17.121
        - You can't take
       my mother's home.

24:17.123 --> 24:19.223
      - Well, federal law
          says we can.

24:19.225 --> 24:20.991
           You know,
the neighborhood's gentrifying.

24:20.993 --> 24:22.560
            Hipsters
     are having babies now.

24:22.562 --> 24:25.963
     They'd love the place.

24:25.965 --> 24:29.099
        Maybe find drugs
         in the walls.

24:29.101 --> 24:30.134
         - Okay, stop.

24:30.136 --> 24:31.969
            [sighs]

24:33.672 --> 24:36.707
      - You tell your boys
to call it off with the priests.

24:36.709 --> 24:40.244
      I want calaca alive,

24:40.246 --> 24:42.980
    Or your mama's gonna be
 living out of a shopping cart.

25:07.072 --> 25:08.572
     - Make--make a right.

25:08.574 --> 25:10.941
            - Here?
            - Yeah.

25:10.943 --> 25:12.643
- Where is this little bastard?

25:12.645 --> 25:14.044
         - [chuckling]
          we're close.

25:14.046 --> 25:15.946
          These kids,
        they make, like,

25:15.948 --> 25:18.215
       100 bucks a phone
     stealing these things.

25:18.217 --> 25:22.186
  The priests make triple that
 when they sell them overseas.

25:22.188 --> 25:25.256
       [phone vibrating]

25:27.125 --> 25:28.225
              Oop.

25:28.227 --> 25:32.029
          [chuckling]
          my fiancee.

25:32.031 --> 25:36.066
   - Um, when's the wedding?

25:36.068 --> 25:38.802
        - I don't know.
   It can't come soon enough.

25:38.804 --> 25:40.671
 - Eager to tie the knot, huh?

25:40.673 --> 25:41.839
      - No, I'm just sick
          of planning.

25:41.841 --> 25:43.841
   It's like all wendy and I
        ever talk about

25:43.843 --> 25:45.142
     Is wedding organizing.

25:45.144 --> 25:46.644
             - Ah.

25:46.646 --> 25:48.579
  - You ever send racy photos
      to your boyfriends?

25:48.581 --> 25:51.982
    The look olinsky gave me
  when he caught sight of one,

25:51.984 --> 25:54.318
   It's like I'm larry flynt
         or something.

25:54.320 --> 25:56.954
           [chuckles]

25:56.956 --> 25:58.856
    - Um, the kid should be
         in that house.

25:58.858 --> 25:59.924
            - Yeah?
            - Yeah.

25:59.926 --> 26:03.227
   - We may have gotten a hit
  on calaca from the hotline.

26:03.229 --> 26:05.629
      Somebody who matches
 his description was just seen

26:05.631 --> 26:07.965
      Leaving a barbershop
        on south racine.

26:07.967 --> 26:10.301
    - It's owned by an uncle
  of one of the latin priests.

26:10.303 --> 26:13.170
         - I completed
  those breakdowns, sergeant.

26:13.172 --> 26:15.005
     - I need more detail.

26:15.007 --> 26:17.007
      Halstead, my office.

26:21.813 --> 26:24.048
           I told you
  to let the rodiger thing go.

26:24.050 --> 26:25.950
  - I have for the most part.

26:25.952 --> 26:27.251
    - If you're not straight
            with me,

26:27.253 --> 26:28.319
      I can't protect you.

26:28.321 --> 26:30.087
         - Protect me?

26:30.089 --> 26:32.222
  Weren't you just in custody?

26:32.224 --> 26:34.158
          Who are you
        to give advice?

26:34.160 --> 26:35.593
        - Don't push me.

26:35.595 --> 26:39.930
         I will run you
  out of this unit like that.

26:44.269 --> 26:46.604
 - I think lonnie's gonna kill
          another kid.

26:46.606 --> 26:50.608
     - You got eyes on you,
           halstead.

26:50.610 --> 26:52.710
   I've warned you all I can.

27:13.698 --> 27:15.899
             - Hi.
             - Hi.

27:15.901 --> 27:17.935
     - He's your grandson?

27:17.937 --> 27:20.704
     - No, but I treat him
           like one.

27:20.706 --> 27:22.806
    - You know he's a thief?

27:22.808 --> 27:27.111
          - He's been
     stealing phones again.

27:27.113 --> 27:29.980
    - You're aware of this?
     - He's got a problem.

27:29.982 --> 27:31.348
   - I don't have a problem.

27:31.350 --> 27:34.284
    - And the chicago police
      are not at our door.

27:34.286 --> 27:37.821
         You give them
     everything you stole.

27:37.823 --> 27:42.026
     He steals these things
  for the stupid video games.

27:42.028 --> 27:43.360
    - Ma'am, we have reason
           to believe

27:43.362 --> 27:46.397
         He sells these
     to the latin priests.

27:46.399 --> 27:48.866
       - Well, he may be
        a troublemaker,

27:48.868 --> 27:52.369
    But he doesn't associate
          with gangs.

27:52.371 --> 27:54.838
          - The gangs.

27:54.840 --> 27:57.441
