01:52.196 --> 01:56.032
Have you heard of the penguin,
who crossed the Mojave Desert?

01:56.325 --> 02:01.412
It is a true story. The
would not only cross the desert.

02:01.747 --> 02:04.499
It was late summer
in a Pinto from a 976th

02:04.750 --> 02:09.294
Pinto began
that sounds very strange.

02:09.630 --> 02:14.550
Imagine how nervous he was.
"No, no, no, gi, gi, gi."

02:14.885 --> 02:20.348
-Was it the car or the penguin?
"It was a penguin.

02:20.682 --> 02:25.394
He drives into a garage.
He says to the mechanic:

02:25.729 --> 02:29.065
How's it going, bro?
Can you help me?

02:29.358 --> 02:36.239
The mechanic says, "Absolutely, obtuse,
but I have a little busy right now. "

02:36.657 --> 02:42.578
"There is an ice cream parlor on the other
side of the street. "He goes in there.

02:42.955 --> 02:46.082
Jumps up on a chair and ordering
a cup of vanilla ice cream.

02:46.375 --> 02:50.503
There is a problem.
He has flippers.

02:50.796 --> 02:55.258
He can not stay in one place.
He looks at her vanilla ice cream. . .

02:55.592 --> 03:01.055
"Shit." He dives into it.
He swims around in the ice.

03:01.390 --> 03:05.017
He has ice everywhere.
He is famished.

03:05.310 --> 03:08.896
He eats ice
and walk across the street to the mechanic.

03:09.148 --> 03:14.068
"What do you think?"
The mechanic looks at him and says:

03:14.403 --> 03:17.280
"It looks like you've sucked
a seal. "

03:17.531 --> 03:23.536
"Nej, nej, nej, det er is.
Det er bare is." Er du med?

03:26.373 --> 03:30.543
Det er en sand historie.
Den er sand, men ikke morsom.

03:34.882 --> 03:36.883
Wyatt, vi er nogle gader væk.

03:37.134 --> 03:40.720
Trey og Franco tager bagsiden.
Jeg og Dave forsiden.

03:40.971 --> 03:46.225
De svin har intet at miste,
så vær forsigtige.

03:52.274 --> 03:55.526
Wyatt, now we are promoting.

04:32.105 --> 04:36.359
-Who? What do l?
-Police.

04:36.693 --> 04:40.196
-Hvad fanden vil l?
-Hvad vi vil?

04:40.447 --> 04:43.991
You could start with opening
door before we kick it.

04:44.243 --> 04:48.120
Hids jer ikke op.
l er på et farligt sted.

04:48.413 --> 04:51.624
Det gør vel ikke noget, at man
spørger, hvem man åbner for.

04:51.875 --> 04:55.878
Nu ved du det . Luk op!

04:56.129 --> 04:59.924
Okay, bitch, du får det, som du vil.

05:00.217 --> 05:04.011
Lad mig få se legitimation først.

05:04.304 --> 05:10.393
Okay, Yo-Yo. There you have it.
How does it look?

05:39.089 --> 05:43.259
Code Red. A cop shot.
Gunfire 1 -0-8.

05:57.316 --> 05:59.191
I got you.

06:08.327 --> 06:10.578
Come on, you devil.

06:17.002 --> 06:22.923
En betjent er skudt.

06:27.846 --> 06:33.684
Hold ud, Dave.
En betjent er skudt.

06:35.145 --> 06:39.857
Du må ikke dø, Dave.
Hold ud.

06:41.276 --> 06:46.030
-Sorry.
-Shut up.

06:46.365 --> 06:48.908
Sorry.

07:53.807 --> 07:56.392
Hold ud, Trey. De kommer.

07:56.643 --> 08:01.480
Bastards!
l have killed Reno.

08:03.066 --> 08:06.902
Det kræver mange flere af jer
for at dræbe mig.

08:12.075 --> 08:14.118
Skiderikker!

09:00.707 --> 09:03.584
Se på mig, din djævel.

09:06.213 --> 09:08.506
Look at me.

10:02.811 --> 10:06.855
-Fatter you doing here?
-What do we know?

10:07.190 --> 10:13.362
In addition to them here, we've grandmother
and his mother, younger brother and his sister.

10:16.366 --> 10:20.286
-What is the white powder?
-Fire extinguisher.

10:20.579 --> 10:25.666
This sounds a little absurd, but with
tanks on fire damage-

10:26.001 --> 10:30.921
And the powder, it looks as though
they poured gasoline on him, lit-

10:31.256 --> 10:37.553
-og så slukkede ham. Så gentog
de det mindst to gange til.

10:39.681 --> 10:44.560
-Who owns the place?
-A Malcolm Varanato.

10:44.936 --> 10:50.774
-Do you think Malcolm Varnado?
"Yeah, you know him?

10:51.151 --> 10:54.945
He is a journalist in Picayune.
His older brother Weddo-

10:55.238 --> 10:57.990
-Is one of the largest
drug dealers in New Orleans.

10:58.241 --> 11:05.164
-Hvad betyder det?
-Det her er lidt for stort for os.

11:15.050 --> 11:19.678
Jeg læser det nu, Mike.

11:20.013 --> 11:22.431
Kom ind.

11:22.641 --> 11:26.977
Jeg skider på, hvad l har hørt.
Sandheden kan ikke stemmes frem.

11:27.312 --> 11:32.149
Overdriver jeg? Kom herover
og tag med os ud på gaden.

11:33.360 --> 11:38.238
Det var jo trist. Ring tilbage,
hvis du vil tage det op igen.

11:43.787 --> 11:51.168
I wish that one day
permit hunting politicians.

11:51.628 --> 11:55.881
-How you doing, Pete?
-Good. Thank you peeped.

11:56.174 --> 12:00.260
-Hvad sker der?
-Et par ting.

12:00.553 --> 12:04.348
-Du må gøre mig tjeneste.
-Okay, hvad er det?

12:04.641 --> 12:08.477
Journalist-in Picayune.
-Weddos little brother.

12:08.770 --> 12:12.898
He is on the warpath.

12:13.233 --> 12:18.278
He takes them before us, we are fortunate
if we not only find snippets.

12:21.032 --> 12:28.455
Det minder mig om tjenesten, ja.
Drabsafdelingen vil have en fra krim-

12:28.915 --> 12:34.002
-To help them, and. . .
your name was mentioned.

12:35.839 --> 12:40.134
Sure.
That sounds fine.

12:40.468 --> 12:43.846
One more thing.

12:52.063 --> 12:57.025
Johnny Trans advokat hævder,
at du forsøgte at dræbe ham.

13:00.405 --> 13:05.367
I disarmed him.
He had a scale of 1 5 cm.

13:05.702 --> 13:08.579
He got off lightly.

13:08.830 --> 13:11.665
I've seen the pictures. It looked
as though a bomb had hit him.

13:11.916 --> 13:15.461
-Is that why I'm here?
-Yes, that's it.

13:15.754 --> 13:20.799
Fire klager på en måned og
ildkampen. Du er ved at miste grebet.

13:21.134 --> 13:26.930
-You blame me for Dave and Trey?
-No, what happened in the house afterwards?

13:29.017 --> 13:34.354
The internal public interrogating the boys.
Do not you think they want to know-

13:34.731 --> 13:39.526
-hvem der skød en fyr på nært hold
og havde et tomt våben i hånden?

13:41.029 --> 13:44.865
Det kræver ikke et geni
at forstå, hvad der skete.

13:59.297 --> 14:04.384
Jeg ved, hvad du kæmper med.

14:06.429 --> 14:10.557
Jeg har selv været der.
Det ved du.

14:13.645 --> 14:19.316
But you continue
similarly. . .

14:21.110 --> 14:24.530
. . . You will never
get back again.

14:33.081 --> 14:37.793
-Was that all?
-Yes, that was it.

15:51.451 --> 15:54.328
Hello. How's it going, bro?

15:55.330 --> 15:59.750
Colin, what the hell are you doing here?

16:00.043 --> 16:03.462
Er det sådan, du hilser på folk?

16:03.755 --> 16:07.883
How long have you been in town?

16:08.176 --> 16:13.889
Where's wife and Jacob?
-At her parents.

16:14.307 --> 16:18.477
-Come on, we grab a beer.
"It has been a hard day.

16:18.770 --> 16:23.565
I go to bed.

16:23.900 --> 16:30.489
-Okay, we drink here.
-Wait a minute. . . Okay, one drink.

16:30.907 --> 16:33.825
-You give.
-This is how it sounds.

16:38.247 --> 16:41.208
Two Jamie, darling.

16:44.170 --> 16:48.632
-Var stormen virkelig så slem?
-Ja, for fanden.

16:48.967 --> 16:53.220
Where dams burst,
it looks like a bomb crater.

16:53.471 --> 16:56.348
The whole area is gone.

16:56.599 --> 17:02.229
The worst thing was seeing people wade
over the corpses-

17:02.605 --> 17:05.440
-As if they were not there.

17:07.986 --> 17:14.992
Please know that I appreciate
you got my grandfather out.

17:16.703 --> 17:20.705
I drove past a house the other day
which was completely wiped out.

17:21.708 --> 17:25.167
-How is he?
-Good.

17:25.461 --> 17:28.547
He has moved in with
his sister in Algiers.

17:28.798 --> 17:33.343
And you?
-A little here and there, you know.

17:35.096 --> 17:38.849
I said from before you
immediately after Fallujah.

17:39.142 --> 17:42.477
I got a job at a security company.

17:43.521 --> 17:47.524
-Which team?
-Spartan.

17:48.568 --> 17:55.407
-They paid well.
-You must survive to get the salary.

17:55.825 --> 18:00.996
And it says one who chose
to become a cop in the city.

18:01.289 --> 18:07.335
This is gonna be soon as Baghdad.
Thank you.

18:07.754 --> 18:12.632
-Why are you now?
-I do not know.

18:13.801 --> 18:18.680
I travel from town again.
I do not know if I come back.

18:18.973 --> 18:22.642
I would see you one last time.

18:22.935 --> 18:28.065
One last time? Where you going?
The big sleep?

18:30.151 --> 18:33.153
Have you ever done anything. . .

18:34.238 --> 18:38.283
. . . You really want
that you could have done about?

18:38.576 --> 18:43.747
-You know that.
-Have you been able to make amends?

18:44.040 --> 18:47.292
No, it can not.

18:50.713 --> 18:53.799
That was what I thought.

19:00.515 --> 19:04.226
Yes. Now? No, Lewis.

19:04.519 --> 19:07.729
No, it does not work.

19:07.980 --> 19:10.941
We meet at the boardwalk.

19:15.029 --> 19:19.241
I have to go.
I'll meet someone.

19:19.492 --> 19:22.661
Are you saying that kind of
so just to go?

19:22.954 --> 19:26.873
I was about to forget it. I
a birthday gift to Jacob.

19:27.125 --> 19:31.753
It's the new movie with carat tiger.
I bought it in Bangkok.

19:32.004 --> 19:36.758
-It is not out yet. Watch it.
-Colin!

19:37.927 --> 19:41.847
What gives?

19:42.140 --> 19:45.767
"It was good to see you.
-Colin!

20:00.491 --> 20:03.952
You said that you would have
a license, not a passport.

20:04.203 --> 20:08.331
-Yes, a Californian.
"It's okay.

20:14.172 --> 20:17.007
I lists behind you.

20:19.302 --> 20:24.347
Okay. You grasped it, Lewis?
Do it and came over here again.

20:27.268 --> 20:31.730
Now it takes only a moment.
Are you ready?

20:35.109 --> 20:37.694
One, two. . .

20:52.084 --> 20:53.960
Damn!

21:12.104 --> 21:15.232
It will hurt a little.

21:20.655 --> 21:23.323
I have not done anything.

21:24.951 --> 21:28.370
I knew him not once.

21:31.374 --> 21:33.667
I have not done anything.

21:51.435 --> 21:54.396
What are you doing? Stop!

22:40.067 --> 22:44.237
Lewis, it's Tom again.
I would just buzz.

22:44.530 --> 22:47.824
Sonny asked me to call you-

22:48.075 --> 22:51.661
-To hear if you could look into
the studio as soon as you can.

22:51.912 --> 22:55.206
Hope you are well. See you.

22:57.043 --> 23:00.337
This is ridiculous.

23:04.216 --> 23:07.260
Crowe!

23:13.267 --> 23:17.729
I do not think it succeeds.
He does not step on it.

23:20.316 --> 23:25.528
Let me get some guys and see
what I can dig up.

23:25.905 --> 23:30.575
What do you say, Renko?
Come on. See you, boss.

23:57.269 --> 24:03.358
You know what, Sonny?
I was suddenly a strange insight.

24:03.734 --> 24:07.404
You and I resemble each other enough
more than you thought.

24:07.696 --> 24:11.950
Listen here. We are both artists.

24:12.243 --> 24:17.497
We may well have chosen
working with different mediums. . .

24:17.873 --> 24:20.959
. . . Or canvases, if you want.

24:21.210 --> 24:24.712
But we want both the same.

24:24.964 --> 24:31.052
We will communicate our innermost
thoughts and feelings.

24:31.429 --> 24:33.972
Not true? What?

24:35.099 --> 24:37.225
Not true?

24:37.435 --> 24:45.358
Say it again, Sonny. Where were
your friend Lewis meet him?

24:45.818 --> 24:52.031
He had to recover a debt.
He brides be back now.

24:52.450 --> 24:56.911
-Where is he now?
-I have no idea. Maybe something went wrong.

24:57.204 --> 25:02.333
He's maybe gone out with his girl.
I do not know. I swear.

25:02.710 --> 25:08.506
-We are back where we started.
-I try.

25:10.718 --> 25:17.849
Må jeg stille et spørgsmål? Har du
hørt myten om Baba Yaga?

25:28.152 --> 25:30.361
Nej!

26:03.187 --> 26:07.607
Will, jeg har tjekket
de seneste numre på mobilen.

26:07.900 --> 26:11.945
They all go to the same two numbers,
again and again.

26:12.238 --> 26:17.617
Prøv at spore dem. Det giver
nok ingenting, men man ved aldrig.

26:36.345 --> 26:41.724
-Sean Riley? Kommissær Will Genz.
-Hyggeligt at møde dig.

26:42.101 --> 26:45.979
-Hvem leder efterforskningen?
-Det burde være mig.

26:46.272 --> 26:50.984
-Beklager, Trahan har sendt mig.
-Det ved jeg. Tak, fordi du kom.

26:51.318 --> 26:55.113
-Vi tror, du kan hjælpe os.
-Hvad har l?

26:55.406 --> 26:58.533
Now I'll show you.

26:58.784 --> 27:01.286
-Is there more?
-Much more.

27:01.537 --> 27:06.082
Mo, kom med op på taget.

27:08.586 --> 27:10.461
Genz.

27:12.590 --> 27:14.757
Jeg kommer med det samme.

27:14.925 --> 27:19.053
Pressen er her.
Vis ham det. Jeg kommer om lidt.

27:25.394 --> 27:29.230
Vil l undskylde os et øjeblik?

27:29.481 --> 27:36.029
Vi tror, at det her er ejeren.
Beaumont.

27:37.781 --> 27:42.285
-Is it Sonny?
"Yeah, you know him?

27:42.620 --> 27:47.290
Ja, En småfusker. Forfalsker
id-kort, pas, kreditkort osv.

27:47.625 --> 27:52.587
-Det forklarer det, vi fandt dernede.
-Jeg læste om Weddos lillebror.

27:52.921 --> 27:58.509
Er det samme fremgangsmåde?
Tænde, slukke, tænde dem igen?

27:58.886 --> 28:03.598
-Kan Weddo være indblandet?
-Tænker du anderledes?

28:03.891 --> 28:06.684
I think not.

28:06.935 --> 28:11.481
But I do not know anyone who would
dare to stand up against him.

28:11.815 --> 28:16.527
-What are you looking for?
-Sonny handled with a Lewis.

28:16.862 --> 28:20.865
Can you see it there
at Sonnys right place?

28:21.158 --> 28:26.996
If this is Lewis, he has
also. It was their dog, Bonny.

28:27.373 --> 28:32.210
Har denne fyr og Lewis
ens puddeltatoveringer?

28:33.420 --> 28:37.632
Det lyder fjollet,
men du skulle have mødt hunden.

28:37.925 --> 28:41.969
Det var som pudlernes filmstjerne.
Ligesom Lassie.

28:42.262 --> 28:47.225
Den kunne tælle med poten
og danse som en ballerina.

28:47.559 --> 28:51.688
A very special animals.

28:52.022 --> 28:55.650
-All the witnesses were H. l.S.
-What?

28:55.901 --> 28:58.486
-Remember not a damn thing.
-Yes, this was about.

28:58.737 --> 29:03.783
The guy downstairs fake ID, then. . .

29:04.118 --> 29:08.371
The door was kicked.
They did not respond.

29:10.124 --> 29:16.462
They kill three down and pulls Sonny
up and the kid up here to grilling.

29:16.839 --> 29:20.550
They torture the kid in front of him.

29:20.843 --> 29:25.513
When they finished, they set fire
to them and let them burn in the wind.

29:25.848 --> 29:31.018
-What can I help you?
-Introduce us Weddo. . .

29:31.353 --> 29:36.190
. . . Sonnys family and friends
and anyone who knows something.

29:38.360 --> 29:42.655
I'll see what I can do.
I am running.

29:47.119 --> 29:51.289
Since you went in, were you looking for something.

29:51.623 --> 29:57.503
Yes, bullets. . . Wayward bullets.
There was none.

29:57.880 --> 30:02.300
I do not know if you saw hits.
That kind of takes talent.

30:04.303 --> 30:08.556
So you checked the envelopes.
Gunners stood very close, right?

30:08.849 --> 30:13.895
-They know each other from before.
"Yeah, something like that.

30:14.229 --> 30:17.732
I know some who to talk to.

30:33.540 --> 30:37.043
There he is.
Wait until you meet this genius.

30:38.754 --> 30:41.422
Mel.

30:41.673 --> 30:46.010
-Hi.
"I have a question. Come straight.

30:46.303 --> 30:50.056
Come and talk to me.

30:50.349 --> 30:56.103
Do not do it. . . Taking a step to
I turn the rest of your teeth out.

30:56.480 --> 30:58.773
Come here! Melvin!

30:59.024 --> 31:01.234
Your bugger.

31:21.463 --> 31:24.048
What the hell!

31:24.299 --> 31:27.969
-Good hit.
-What is this?

31:28.220 --> 31:32.515
Credit Card Forgery?
I thought you were too stupid to do so.

31:32.850 --> 31:37.478
I am too. . . I have not
confessed shit. It's father's card.

31:37.813 --> 31:41.816
Rajeev Magambie? Laver du sjov?

31:42.109 --> 31:44.777
Mors fyr.

31:44.987 --> 31:50.491
Do you know
it is a federal crime?

31:50.868 --> 31:55.746
Say what you will. I give you that.
I'll do anything.

31:56.081 --> 31:59.876
-Your boyfriend Lewis?
-Sonny intermediary contact.

32:00.168 --> 32:03.921
It has not helped us.
And the other guy he works with?

32:04.214 --> 32:10.344
I do not know. Last time I saw
them, there was also a white guy.

32:10.721 --> 32:13.222
A madman from The Channel.

32:13.473 --> 32:17.977
-Have you a name?
-Conner, something like that.

32:18.270 --> 32:21.355
-Colin?
-Yes, Colin.

32:24.610 --> 32:27.570
Come, we will leave.

32:28.780 --> 32:32.158
You're lucky today.

32:38.874 --> 32:42.251
Mo, hvad foregår der?

32:42.544 --> 32:46.797
Har du sporet Sonnys mobil?
Vent lidt.

32:47.090 --> 32:49.342
Give me the address.

32:51.595 --> 32:55.097
Fandens også! Sean.

32:55.390 --> 33:00.061
-Døren var åben.
-Du skræmte livet af mig.

33:00.395 --> 33:04.523
Where you going, Stac?

33:04.816 --> 33:07.985
Rejsetasken. Hvor skal du hen?

33:09.071 --> 33:13.032
"I plan to visit mom on weekends.
-You are lying.

33:13.325 --> 33:16.452
-Rend mig!
-Er det din bil udenfor?

33:16.703 --> 33:20.206
You have everything you own in it.
Where you going?

33:20.499 --> 33:23.209
Why you ask?

33:25.462 --> 33:30.383
Where's Colin?
-I have not seen him for two years.

33:33.929 --> 33:37.682
-Where you meet him?
-I will not.

33:37.975 --> 33:42.812
I would never ever
see him again.

33:44.189 --> 33:49.860
-Two years? What the hell is this so?
"It is mine. I've earned them.

33:50.237 --> 33:55.157
I want to get away from here and stay clean.
I'm moving to Florida.

33:55.492 --> 33:59.161
-Jeg vil høre sandheden!
-Jeg skal ikke møde ham!

33:59.413 --> 34:02.540
I'll call back.

34:06.712 --> 34:09.338
You must believe me.

34:10.424 --> 34:14.802
"I hope you realize that it's true.
-I swear.

34:18.514 --> 34:21.559
I saw Colin on the street
a few nights ago.

34:22.601 --> 34:26.813
He was drunk and stoned.

34:27.107 --> 34:32.777
He fablede that he would flee.

34:33.155 --> 34:37.408
He freaked out, started to cry
and gave me money and said:

34:37.701 --> 34:42.455
Ask not please them
and-ride from the city.

34:51.339 --> 34:54.507
Sagde han, hvor han tog hen?

34:56.011 --> 34:59.346
Yes, he said,
that he would meet with you.

35:10.650 --> 35:14.320
-What was it about?
-What has your guy been?

35:14.613 --> 35:16.822
We have traced one of the tracks.

35:17.074 --> 35:20.993
The bills are in one place
near MLK.

35:44.851 --> 35:49.939
-You did not speak much in the car.
-Sorry, I have a lot to think about.

35:50.315 --> 35:53.192
-Like what, Colin?
-What?

35:53.443 --> 35:59.657
He is your friend, right? Is he
on the bucket? Who is after him?

36:00.033 --> 36:03.869
Do you feel outside? I know
not what he's doing, okay?

36:04.162 --> 36:07.123
He attracts trouble
like a magnet.

36:07.374 --> 36:11.085
-How long have you known him?
Whole-life.

36:11.378 --> 36:14.672
Every time I come into something
He stood in the middle of it.

36:14.923 --> 36:19.510
We go back to what Stacey said.
Did he do it?

36:19.845 --> 36:23.848
-Did you get him?
-Yes, yesterday evening.

36:24.141 --> 36:27.893
And you had not thought you
to say something?

36:28.186 --> 36:31.605
-What would he do?
-I do not know.

36:31.898 --> 36:36.735
You'll be the first to hear it,
when I find out.

36:37.028 --> 36:41.824
-Should we do it here?
-After you, sir.

37:15.734 --> 37:18.152
There you can see.

37:21.072 --> 37:26.118
Hello, boys.
Take it easy, tough guys.

37:26.453 --> 37:30.122
It was rude not to knock.
Take it easy.

37:30.415 --> 37:34.877
It can be very uncomfortable
very quickly if we do not relax.

37:37.464 --> 37:39.882
L understand that?

39:20.358 --> 39:22.609
Damn!

39:35.332 --> 39:39.293
-Do you not! Stand!
-Wait, Sean!

39:39.627 --> 39:43.797
Stand, cop.
Stupid pussy cop!

39:44.090 --> 39:47.301
-Put the weapon from you!
-Shut up, loser!

39:47.552 --> 39:50.888
-You are a fucking bitch.
-Put the weapon from you!

39:51.181 --> 39:57.269
Go to hell, idiot!
I'll kill her! I warn you!

39:57.645 --> 40:00.898
Vær stille, skat.

40:01.149 --> 40:04.985
-Læg våbenet fra dig.
-Vil du se det?

40:05.278 --> 40:08.822
I'll kill her on the spot.
She dies for your sake!

40:09.115 --> 40:12.618
Her brain mass
will flow out.

40:44.109 --> 40:48.028
What happened?

40:48.279 --> 40:52.199
-Something went badly wrong.
-What do you mean?

40:52.409 --> 40:55.369
I want details!

40:55.578 --> 40:59.915
Journalists reported
a kind of shootout.

41:01.042 --> 41:06.130
All are dead, Crowe.
Renko, Cole. The whole gang.

41:09.717 --> 41:13.053
How the hell is this possible?

41:22.689 --> 41:27.276
-Hello?
-Is that all you have to say, Raymond?

41:27.569 --> 41:31.572
I'm done waiting. It is
firm is also, I understood.

41:31.865 --> 41:37.828
-I have at least track them.
"It's why we're still talking.

41:38.204 --> 41:43.000
You do not threaten me.
I'm with. Give me a little more time.

41:43.334 --> 41:46.462
You must accept the fact-

41:46.754 --> 41:51.258
And deliver what you promised.
You knew the risks.

41:51.551 --> 41:56.513
Vi har arbejdet sammen længe nu.
Du kan nok overbevise firmaet om. . .

41:56.848 --> 42:01.602
Stop, Raymond.
Jeg kan ikke klare at høre på dig.

42:01.936 --> 42:05.105
-Jeg beder dig om at. . .
-Det er nok. Det er, hvad det er.

42:05.356 --> 42:08.400
Nothing has changed.
You have time until midnight.

42:08.610 --> 42:12.154
-Midnight tomorrow.
-Wait Richter.

42:12.405 --> 42:17.659
-Das korovai.
-For fanden, vent! Richter!

42:23.458 --> 42:31.673
Griff, you and Dekker have to find out
what went so fucking wrong!

42:32.133 --> 42:35.093
Come on, boys.

42:45.313 --> 42:47.648
Hello, darling.

42:47.857 --> 42:51.151
-Are you okay?
-Yes, fine.

42:51.444 --> 42:56.365
Mostly thanks to him here.
Sean, my beautiful wife Beth.

42:56.699 --> 42:59.284
-Hi, Beth.
-Nice to meet you.

42:59.494 --> 43:04.206
My Princess Sarah. . .
And here is little Mad Max.

43:06.668 --> 43:08.752
Pic. . .

43:09.003 --> 43:12.047
Come on, Dad, I will show you something.

43:12.340 --> 43:17.594
-Kom ind.
-Sean, du bliver til middag.

43:21.224 --> 43:24.893
-Tak, det var lækkert.
-lngen årsag.

43:27.647 --> 43:31.275
Er det kun mig, der synes,
at de er meget stille?

43:31.568 --> 43:36.697
-Hvordan mødtes l?
-En af dine versioner, eller sandheden?

43:37.031 --> 43:42.452
Vi mødtes ved universitetet. Jeg løb
tør for benzin, og han reddede mig.

43:42.829 --> 43:46.373
Lucky-ass.
-Yes, no?

43:46.583 --> 43:50.002
Is there a Mrs. Riley?

43:50.253 --> 43:54.381
"Yes, sometime.
-Any kids?

43:54.674 --> 43:58.135
We had a son. His name was Jacob.

43:59.721 --> 44:07.144
He was six when he got leukemia.
Eighteen months later he died.

44:09.063 --> 44:12.232
She left me behind.

44:12.483 --> 44:17.571
She could probably not endure,
I reminded her of him.

44:19.949 --> 44:23.368
"I apologize.
-No, leave them alone.

44:23.620 --> 44:31.376
Usually I find something
to avoid appearing pathetic.

44:32.795 --> 44:37.049
I said for the rest,
what wonderful family l have?

44:37.342 --> 44:40.719
lsær your little princess.

44:41.012 --> 44:45.682
Sarah, what do poor fellow.
Come on, champ.

44:46.726 --> 44:51.396
-You will not be the princess.
-He looks like his father.

44:51.731 --> 44:56.777
This benefits you receive?
Now we find a fireman's uniform.

44:57.987 --> 45:00.697
Thank you.

45:03.368 --> 45:07.454
It's a nice neighborhood.

45:09.749 --> 45:14.795
-What?
"I'm sorry.

45:15.171 --> 45:20.217
-I let you down.
-Nonsense.

45:20.551 --> 45:25.472
You responded that all
others would have done.

45:25.807 --> 45:29.059
You went to them as if
you had the odds on your side.

45:29.310 --> 45:33.230
It is not the same.
There is a difference.

45:37.026 --> 45:42.364
When you came around the corner today
so you me.

45:42.740 --> 45:48.370
You did not men with weapons.
You saw only your happy family.

45:49.414 --> 45:55.335
I do not have it to lose.
It's the difference.

45:59.507 --> 46:03.719
There is a blessing in everything.

46:04.011 --> 46:07.931
My father was a preacher.

46:09.350 --> 46:14.187
Was there anything he learned, so it was
that everything had a meaning.

46:14.480 --> 46:17.357
Do you believe it?

46:17.608 --> 46:24.656
What sense is there in
to a 4-year-old to suffer for two years?

46:25.074 --> 46:29.119
-Is there a sense in that?
-Think about what happened today.

46:29.412 --> 46:33.373
If things had gone differently,
As I lay dead on the street now.

46:33.666 --> 46:38.170
"It was intended that I should live.
"It is easy to say now.

46:38.463 --> 46:41.923
Are they not possible,
that what happened your family

46:42.216 --> 46:44.634
-Not only was
a random accident?

46:44.886 --> 46:50.223
-There is perhaps a higher meaning?
-What do you mean?

46:50.558 --> 46:54.561
I do not believe in miracles.
I'm not a saint.

46:54.854 --> 46:59.775
Today, you were a saint
for me and my family.

47:01.778 --> 47:05.280
Okay, it's late.

47:05.531 --> 47:09.075
You must believe what you want
I think what I want.

47:09.368 --> 47:12.788
"It's okay.
-What?

47:13.039 --> 47:17.125
What kind of a mine?
Want to drag me to church?

47:17.418 --> 47:21.630
-What about on Sunday?
-No.

47:22.924 --> 47:27.886
It's late. I gotta get
my keys, and you must sleep.

47:56.999 --> 48:01.503
Yes. Nobody problems.
What happens?

48:03.047 --> 48:05.382
Where?

48:06.259 --> 48:09.344
I'm on the road.

48:32.118 --> 48:37.163
-Hi, how are you?
-Are you sure it's her?

48:37.498 --> 48:43.545
You see, what that means? It
is not about Weddo, but about Colin.

48:43.880 --> 48:47.132
Could you trace the other numbers
Sonny on mobile?

48:47.383 --> 48:50.760
Cards on fupadresser.

48:51.053 --> 48:56.808
Look at the journalist's conversation lists on
same number pops up somewhere.

48:57.143 --> 49:02.063
-Do you think it's Colin?
-I must run.

49:07.320 --> 49:11.948
-What have we here, Sean?
"It does not look good.

49:12.283 --> 49:15.869
-Do we know who it is?
-Her name is Stacey.

49:16.120 --> 49:22.042
We questioned her yesterday. She can
be linked to a possible suspect.

49:22.418 --> 49:29.966
A possible? Then
suspicion rate higher now, right?

49:30.384 --> 49:34.471
I'm sorry to say this, but I
was called by management.

49:34.805 --> 49:40.977
The press put pressure on them
regarding the exchange of fire yesterday.

49:42.355 --> 49:46.650
-They're after you.
-They will probably not sacrifice me?

49:46.943 --> 49:52.614
"It looks like this.
-How much time do I have?

49:52.990 --> 49:56.910
Until tomorrow.

49:57.203 --> 50:00.705
-Are there other ways?
-I think not.

50:00.957 --> 50:03.917
Damn.
I need your help.

50:04.210 --> 50:08.505
Do you think that the techniques can accelerate
identification of the exchange of fire?

50:10.091 --> 50:13.593
-Sean. . .
-Come on, Pete.

50:13.886 --> 50:17.389
I will do what I can.

50:24.480 --> 50:30.026
I thought I was smart.
Colin phoned him many times.

50:30.403 --> 50:34.656
-Why a journalist?
"It must be something big.

50:34.949 --> 50:39.202
-He has nothing on those chasing him.
-What they do not want out.

50:39.495 --> 50:44.332
We must find him before they do it.
We are shown below.

52:04.205 --> 52:07.874
Tell what you know.
You know everyone here.

52:08.084 --> 52:11.294
-Is l lost?
Run-on.

52:11.545 --> 52:16.049
-Have you bought it mail order?
-Would you look at it?

52:16.383 --> 52:19.594
I would like.

52:39.990 --> 52:44.869
-What the hell is happening?
-Who am l?

52:45.204 --> 52:48.289
Remove the caps.

52:59.844 --> 53:04.430
-Can you recognize me, white?
-Yes, I know who you are.

53:04.765 --> 53:10.270
Then we go straight to the point.
I want to know what l know.

53:10.646 --> 53:16.568
-Are you making fun?
-Do I look like a comedian?

53:18.654 --> 53:21.698
Someone killed my family.

53:21.949 --> 53:24.742
Grilled my brother alive.

53:24.994 --> 53:32.208
It took the only good,
the only pure, I've had.

53:33.377 --> 53:37.255
We do not know a damn thing.

53:37.548 --> 53:41.426
Wait. You have misunderstood.

53:41.719 --> 53:45.597
"It's not about you.
"It's not about Malcolm.

53:45.890 --> 53:49.934
No, but on his job.

53:50.269 --> 53:55.023
Your brother was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

53:55.316 --> 54:01.487
I know what you want. I had done
the same, but it is not the solution.

54:01.906 --> 54:08.161
-What is a good solution?
-Let us do our work.

54:08.537 --> 54:14.876
Tracking people is what we are good at.
We find the bastard.

54:15.294 --> 54:21.507
He is right. We are your best bet
to convict them before leaving.

54:26.680 --> 54:28.848
Okay. . .

54:29.099 --> 54:36.189
We follow your rules, but I will
be a shadow that waits.

54:36.607 --> 54:42.904
Det her vil ikke bare drive over.
Den skiderik skal bøde for det.

54:45.783 --> 54:49.202
Jeg er med.

55:00.965 --> 55:05.218
-Are we back where we started?
-Let me see if the FBI has matched. . .

55:05.552 --> 55:09.097
Hurry. Will speak
on the phone with them now.

55:09.348 --> 55:14.435
-What did l learn?
-Lngenting. Nobody knows anything.

55:14.770 --> 55:19.232
-De har identificeret den brændte.
-Lewis Gunther.

55:19.525 --> 55:23.152
-Hvad er deres forbindelse?
-Lewis var Sonnys fyr.

55:23.445 --> 55:27.448
-Og de her?
-Det er lidt mærkeligt.

55:27.741 --> 55:32.912
All lD-papers are fake.

55:33.247 --> 55:39.043
Nothing internet nonsense. Things high
quality. I thought they were real.

55:39.420 --> 55:43.381
Look at the beautiful over here.

55:44.466 --> 55:48.303
It is here you will find interesting.

55:48.595 --> 55:53.266
They dug them out of the shoulder.
They thought it was kulrester.

55:57.021 --> 56:00.481
-What is it?
-Shrapnel.

56:00.774 --> 56:07.155
I thought so too.
Watch it here.

56:14.079 --> 56:17.081
Techniques think it is from
a 3-0-8 or even higher.

56:17.333 --> 56:21.669
One of the cool room has a
Cyrillic tattoo on the arm-

56:21.962 --> 56:27.342
And something resembling burns
from white phosphorus on the whole back.

56:27.718 --> 56:31.387
-War Injuries.
"It looks like this.

56:31.638 --> 56:35.224
That explains a lot.

56:35.517 --> 56:41.022
l yesterday during the shooting.
Their weapons, tactics. . .

56:41.357 --> 56:48.654
-Former. soldiers?
-More than that. They are professionals.

56:50.491 --> 56:55.536
-Det er jo alle tiders.
-Hvad foregår der?

56:55.871 --> 56:59.957
Hvad er du rodet ind i?

57:07.132 --> 57:11.677
Colin tries
contact Weddos little brother.

57:12.012 --> 57:16.140
Those who are after Colin, finds him
first. Colin finds out.

57:16.433 --> 57:20.770
So he freak out and look
have to disappear.

57:21.105 --> 57:24.524
But without lD
get fairly close.

57:24.775 --> 57:27.693
So he contacts Sonny.
They do also.

57:27.945 --> 57:32.281
How they found out
whom Colin had to contact?

57:32.616 --> 57:36.744
-You can see his interview lists.
-How?

57:37.037 --> 57:41.707
You said they are good. He committed
maybe a mistake when he bought the phone.

57:42.042 --> 57:46.129
The credit card he used,
or an alias, they have gotten in.

57:46.422 --> 57:49.590
They found at least out of it.

57:49.842 --> 57:54.303
It took us from the Australian
the parking lot.

57:56.223 --> 58:01.811
When reopened Rays? The club
've been closed since the storm.

58:02.146 --> 58:07.650
I worked with a murder opposite
two weeks ago. Since there was closed.

58:08.026 --> 58:10.194
Wait a minute.

58:12.114 --> 58:16.200
What do you think of
when you hear my name?

58:17.619 --> 58:21.956
I thought so. Was that why
you are not told about your son?

58:22.291 --> 58:25.960
Or whether that Renee had left you?

58:26.211 --> 58:32.258
I'm very sorry. I would
wish I could have assisted you.

58:33.510 --> 58:40.433
-What would you have done?
-Something. Anything.

58:40.851 --> 58:46.856
I never helped you.
I've never reciprocated you.

58:47.232 --> 58:51.444
-Overgiv dig til mig.
-Glem det, Sean.

58:51.778 --> 58:56.073
You can not save me this time.

58:56.366 --> 58:59.285
If you continue, you will not
could save yourself.

58:59.536 --> 59:04.415
-Tell me where you are.
-You're not listening.

59:04.750 --> 59:08.794
-Unleash it.
-Colin!

59:09.087 --> 59:13.257
I must tell you about Stacey.
Damn!

59:18.055 --> 59:25.478
It is over five years ago.
What does the napkin in his pocket?

59:27.814 --> 59:30.066
Damn!

59:42.704 --> 59:45.039
Sorry.

59:48.252 --> 59:51.295
As leader after l?

59:53.382 --> 59:57.260
-Stacey O'Neill.
-Never heard of her.

59:57.553 --> 01:00:00.054
Should I?

01:00:02.558 --> 01:00:08.229
Sorry. I am assistant Riley,
this stuff is assistant Genz. And you are?

01:00:08.564 --> 01:00:11.857
Raymond Crowe, hello.

01:00:14.194 --> 01:00:17.488
We are looking for a girl.

01:00:17.739 --> 01:00:21.867
A friend says she worked
as a dancer here last week.

01:00:22.828 --> 01:00:26.497
Did she? It was strange.

01:00:26.790 --> 01:00:30.668
As you see, we build on
and we have no employees.

01:00:30.961 --> 01:00:34.255
Is she in trouble?

01:00:36.049 --> 01:00:38.968
It may well say.

01:00:44.808 --> 01:00:49.228
You'll excuse me.
I have much to do.

01:00:49.563 --> 01:00:53.190
I know that l have busy
renovation-

01:00:53.483 --> 01:00:57.570
-But I can tie her
to this nightclub.

01:00:58.614 --> 01:01:02.908
I just keep my job.
Do you understand?

01:01:03.243 --> 01:01:08.122
Yes, and I try to do mine.
Do you understand?

01:01:10.083 --> 01:01:14.337
Make it something
if I give you some advice?

01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:21.886
If I were you, I'd be
very careful with this stuff.

01:01:23.221 --> 01:01:29.977
A man who makes the kind
can find anything.

01:01:33.315 --> 01:01:37.318
Serves you right in.

01:01:39.154 --> 01:01:42.406
One can also see it like this.

01:01:42.658 --> 01:01:48.954
If I were him, I would fear to
what I could find.

01:01:54.419 --> 01:01:57.630
Nice to meet.
Here's my card.

01:01:58.924 --> 01:02:05.262
If you or one of your friends
will talk. . . do not hesitate.

01:02:07.099 --> 01:02:12.603
I am sure that we meet,
policewoman Riley.

01:02:22.447 --> 01:02:28.202
"It's him, right?
-Jo.

01:02:29.204 --> 01:02:32.415
Wait. What was it about?

01:02:32.708 --> 01:02:37.128
So you know how the big
Satan stared at you?

01:02:37.421 --> 01:02:39.714
I think I made them angry?

01:02:39.965 --> 01:02:43.968
Is it your plan to excite
assassins?

01:02:44.219 --> 01:02:48.806
Fine. I stand by.
I want to be grandpa again.

01:02:49.099 --> 01:02:55.062
Yes, damn it. . .
Colin, I know where he is.

01:03:25.886 --> 01:03:30.473
-Where are we?
-Colin's grandfather's house. We played here.

01:03:30.766 --> 01:03:33.559
Colin!

01:03:37.689 --> 01:03:47.364
Col!

01:03:49.868 --> 01:03:52.453
Colin!

01:03:53.538 --> 01:03:57.166
Colin, can you hear me?
That's me.

01:03:59.711 --> 01:04:02.713
Colin?

01:04:02.964 --> 01:04:04.799
Col?

01:04:08.929 --> 01:04:12.515
Pipes you do not.
Do not blink once.

01:04:14.810 --> 01:04:18.854
Turn you on. Slowly.

01:04:19.147 --> 01:04:23.359
Colin, that's me.
What are you doing?

01:04:24.945 --> 01:04:28.572
-Who is he?
-My partner. Forget him.

01:04:28.865 --> 01:04:32.910
Du må fortælle,
hvad der foregår.

01:04:34.621 --> 01:04:37.998
I thought you had grasped it.

01:04:40.418 --> 01:04:46.298
I asked you the tray out.
Listening not, you must take the consequences.

01:04:46.675 --> 01:04:51.512
Go to hell!
Everything here is your responsibility.

01:04:51.847 --> 01:04:56.350
-Will you arrest me?
-You are lucky if I do not.

01:04:56.643 --> 01:04:59.937
They would love it. Lock me up
in a cage and make it easy for them.

01:05:00.188 --> 01:05:05.651
-Who are you talking about?
-Puppet Master that keeps the strings.

01:05:05.986 --> 01:05:10.698
The drugs have ravaged you,
so you can not see clearly anymore.

01:05:11.032 --> 01:05:13.826
I just need. . . Damn.

01:05:15.370 --> 01:05:18.747
I will just go away from here.

01:05:18.999 --> 01:05:22.376
If you do not shut me in,
I can not help you.

01:05:24.588 --> 01:05:27.756
The company I work for-

01:05:28.008 --> 01:05:31.135
-Let me work hard for
a mysterious client based in LA.

01:05:32.762 --> 01:05:36.473
A loathsome task.

01:05:37.434 --> 01:05:41.937
It was totally crazy.
You can not imagine it.

01:05:44.399 --> 01:05:49.445
The last job broke me.

01:05:49.779 --> 01:05:56.619
The mysterious client would ensure
some interest in a war zone.

01:05:57.037 --> 01:06:02.333
It was not a dangerous operation,
and so. . . names.

01:06:02.667 --> 01:06:07.046
-What would they gain by that?
-For God's sake!

01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:12.176
They do not want
the war ends.

01:06:16.556 --> 01:06:22.686
Colin, what are you wearing them?

01:06:23.104 --> 01:06:27.358
-What do you have?
-I have a videotape.

01:06:29.569 --> 01:06:33.906
I stole it. I have supervisory
Movies battles and interrogations.

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:39.453
Jeg har ting, der kan sænke alle,
der har haft med Spartan at gøre.

01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:44.291
Do away with it.
Put it on the internet.

01:06:44.584 --> 01:06:48.796
Er du dum i hovedet?
Det er min eneste chance.

01:06:49.130 --> 01:06:53.467
Det er min eneste sikkerhed.
Derfor gik jeg til journalisten.

01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:59.306
Han kendte en fra justitsministeriet,
som skulle anholde mig.

01:06:59.641 --> 01:07:06.647
Det handler kun om, at du vil
redde dig selv. Du er skidedum.

01:07:07.065 --> 01:07:11.193
Ved du, hvad du har gjort?
Ved du det?

01:07:11.486 --> 01:07:16.824
-Jeg tog en kopi, hvis nu. . .
-En masse uskyldige er døde.

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:21.954
I have not forced anyone
for anything. Everyone knew the risks.

01:07:22.288 --> 01:07:27.042
Gjorde Stacey det?
De dræbte hende.

01:07:27.377 --> 01:07:31.213
De dræbte din pige.
De brændte hende levende.

01:07:31.506 --> 01:07:34.341
Hvad fanden snakker du om?

01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:41.849
Du lyver.

01:07:42.142 --> 01:07:46.103
Sean, du lyver om hende!
Hun fejler ikke noget.

01:07:46.438 --> 01:07:48.897
You lie!

01:07:55.613 --> 01:08:00.159
Crowe er med på båndet, ikke?
Han arbejder for Spartan.

01:08:00.493 --> 01:08:04.079
Er Crowe ikke med på båndet?

01:08:07.042 --> 01:08:13.213
Hvordan kender du til det navn?
Sig, hvor du hørte det navn.

01:08:24.059 --> 01:08:26.518
Af sted!

01:08:42.868 --> 01:08:45.453
Lader.

01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:05.390
Taget!

01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:29.790
There is a window in the kitchen behind me.

01:09:48.143 --> 01:09:51.353
Out the window all together.
Come on!

01:09:54.983 --> 01:09:58.485
Colin, what do we do?
Col!

01:10:03.616 --> 01:10:07.286
I'm with you. Come on!

01:10:20.133 --> 01:10:22.801
The back of the house!

01:10:43.156 --> 01:10:46.825
-Colin, come on.
-Sorry.

01:10:47.118 --> 01:10:51.371
"I talked all about a reserve plan.
-What the hell are you doing? Come!

01:10:51.664 --> 01:10:56.335
Skynd dig så langt væk som muligt.

01:11:40.797 --> 01:11:45.425
Hvor er videobåndet?

01:11:53.977 --> 01:11:57.271
Det er her.

01:12:51.034 --> 01:12:54.077
Eksplosionen ødelagde
huset totalt.

01:12:54.329 --> 01:12:57.622
Myndighederne har
ingen kommentarer i øjeblikket.

01:12:57.874 --> 01:13:02.085
Kilder siger, at der var soldater
på stedet, før brandvæsenet ankom.

01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:04.838
Man ved ikke,
om der var nogen i huset.

01:13:05.048 --> 01:13:07.716
Politiet har talt med naboer-

01:13:07.967 --> 01:13:11.887
-for at finde ud af, hvad der skete
i det rolige og næsten øde område.

01:13:13.931 --> 01:13:16.933
Mr. Richter.
What can I help you?

01:13:17.185 --> 01:13:22.939
Du kan lyse min dag op ved
at fortælle, at du har gode nyheder.

01:13:23.316 --> 01:13:27.694
Det er ikke midnat endnu.
Jeg har stadig lidt tid.

01:13:27.987 --> 01:13:34.451
-Kan jeg sige, at du har det?
-Jeg ved, hvor det er.

01:13:34.827 --> 01:13:39.247
-Do svidaniya, Raymond.
-Mr Richter. . .

01:13:55.681 --> 01:14:00.352
Mon admits that at least one cop
were involved in the shooting today.

01:14:00.686 --> 01:14:06.858
He is believed to be investigated
interference in two other episodes.

01:14:07.235 --> 01:14:10.946
We follow the sequence of events
throughout the evening.

01:14:17.412 --> 01:14:20.497
Damn!

01:14:51.404 --> 01:14:54.990
Did the officer directly to O'Neill?

01:14:55.283 --> 01:14:59.286
Yes, it was Colin's grandfather's house.

01:14:59.579 --> 01:15:04.875
Find out as much as possible
about this person.

01:15:05.251 --> 01:15:11.506
This disaster is completed. . .
End it tonight.

01:15:22.852 --> 01:15:27.105
Sean, take phone
if you're there.

01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:32.527
lnternefterforskerne has escaped me
and you were already decamped.

01:15:32.862 --> 01:15:37.199
We can find out anything,
but you must talk to me.

01:15:37.492 --> 01:15:42.496
Do not do anything stupid
you will regret.

01:15:42.872 --> 01:15:46.333
Sean, call me.

01:15:49.337 --> 01:15:51.296
Damn!

01:16:10.024 --> 01:16:14.277
Not them. . . them there.

01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:21.034
Hvordan vidste l, at lasten skulle
fragtes gennem denne sektor?

01:16:21.452 --> 01:16:23.828
-Hvordan vidste l det?
-Jeg vidste det ikke.

01:16:24.038 --> 01:16:28.875
Hvad sker der?
Vi har jo talt om det her.

01:16:29.210 --> 01:16:32.504
-L should not do it here.
-What should I do?

01:16:32.755 --> 01:16:36.216
Cole, talk to him.

01:16:36.509 --> 01:16:41.555
l have to do it
in the right way.

01:16:43.975 --> 01:16:48.144
-What the hell are you doing?
-Make sure to get him away.

01:16:49.689 --> 01:16:52.524
Can you help me?

01:16:55.111 --> 01:16:59.698
Stop!
Fortæl, hvordan l vidste det.

01:17:06.831 --> 01:17:09.040
Sluk for det der.

01:17:16.007 --> 01:17:19.968
Your door was kicked.

01:17:20.261 --> 01:17:25.098
-Kaptajn. . .
-Hvad er det her?

01:17:25.433 --> 01:17:29.311
-Jeg kan forklare det.
-Hvad har du gang i?

01:17:29.604 --> 01:17:34.149
If they want to crucify me
let them do it.

01:17:34.483 --> 01:17:40.363
-Let me take the idiot first.
-Do you want to end up like your dad?

01:17:40.740 --> 01:17:45.660
"I warned you against this.
"It is not you. I have proof.

01:17:45.995 --> 01:17:51.124
Fatter you what I've been
through in order to protect you.

01:17:51.459 --> 01:17:58.298
-Are you so blind?
"I'm the suspect away. . .

01:17:58.716 --> 01:18:04.220
-. . . Because we stand here and talk.
-You are not the town's only cop.

01:18:04.597 --> 01:18:10.310
-What do you mean?
-What do you think?

01:18:10.645 --> 01:18:14.272
You know why I'm here?

01:18:14.565 --> 01:18:17.942
Will you arrest me?

01:18:19.945 --> 01:18:25.533
-Let me finish this.
"I know how to end things.

01:18:28.454 --> 01:18:32.040
Do not you think
that pigs deserve it?

01:18:32.333 --> 01:18:39.339
It is precisely the case.
We need not decide.

01:18:42.843 --> 01:18:45.845
You're done with this case.

01:19:11.997 --> 01:19:14.916
Do you remember me?

01:19:23.217 --> 01:19:29.013
Look at all this.
I'm impressed.

01:19:29.348 --> 01:19:32.809
This is Tora Bora, right?

01:19:37.815 --> 01:19:44.904
I've been there with Mr. Dekker
and Cole. They were inseparable.

01:19:45.322 --> 01:19:48.032
Can you remember the Cole?

01:19:51.245 --> 01:19:56.916
We found it here. Thank you.

01:19:57.293 --> 01:20:02.422
-I want to know if there are copies.
-Jack yourself up yours

01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:09.596
What a language. I got a glimpse
Your last mental status.

01:20:11.307 --> 01:20:15.268
I read everything about you and your son.

01:20:15.561 --> 01:20:22.734
Frygteligt. Kæmper du stadig
med at besøge hans grav?

01:20:23.152 --> 01:20:27.739
Jeg blev faktisk rørt,
da jeg læste om det.

01:20:29.867 --> 01:20:33.077
Jeg slår dig sgu ihjel.

01:20:35.039 --> 01:20:36.998
Jer alle sammen.

01:20:40.878 --> 01:20:45.548
We are wasting time here. I want to see if
Griff was more fortunate with the other.

01:21:02.149 --> 01:21:07.403
-He wakes. Beautiful knife.
-Fuck you.

01:21:12.952 --> 01:21:19.332
It is a sweet boy.
It is he really.

01:21:20.918 --> 01:21:25.255
Or should I say "was".

01:21:25.548 --> 01:21:27.924
This must be old.

01:21:28.801 --> 01:21:32.387
Taken before becoming dull
and lost hair.

01:21:33.556 --> 01:21:39.435
ln the cancer ate him up.
He cried a lot?

01:21:41.272 --> 01:21:47.777
He did so safely.
He cried enough both day and night.

01:21:49.822 --> 01:21:52.282
-Yes.
-What?

01:21:55.244 --> 01:21:59.122
Yes, he was crying all the time.

01:22:04.879 --> 01:22:08.590
You know why I was
so proud of him?

01:22:10.175 --> 01:22:13.094
He never begged for his life.

01:22:13.345 --> 01:22:18.933
Not a single time. That is more
than I can say about your friend Cole.

01:22:22.021 --> 01:22:25.648
A real tough guy.

01:22:25.941 --> 01:22:31.154
He begged for his life and pissed in
pants before I killed him.

01:23:02.144 --> 01:23:04.479
Come on, you bastard.

01:24:06.792 --> 01:24:12.088
Hello? Is that you, Sean?
Where's Will?

01:24:12.423 --> 01:24:16.551
-Is he not with you?
-Someone raided the place.

01:24:16.885 --> 01:24:19.762
-What happened?
-There has not been anything to him.

01:24:20.014 --> 01:24:24.434
-What happens? Here's blood.
-Nothing happens.

01:24:24.727 --> 01:24:29.397
Say the hell not such to me!
What happened to him?

01:24:29.732 --> 01:24:33.735
Listen here.
Take the kids to the neighbor.

01:24:34.028 --> 01:24:40.575
-Jeg lover, at Will kommer i aften.
-Hvad vil du gøre, Sean?

01:24:42.661 --> 01:24:46.289
Hvad det kræver.

01:25:09.146 --> 01:25:15.860
Har du hørt historien om Baba Yaga?
Hvorfor skulle du have gjort det?

01:25:17.446 --> 01:25:21.199
Where I come from, Little Odessa,
all know her.

01:25:22.284 --> 01:25:25.536
Baba Yaga was a witch.

01:25:25.829 --> 01:25:31.292
She flew around on her broom and
looking for disobedient boys and girls.

01:25:31.627 --> 01:25:34.337
Når hun havde fundet dem,
listede hun ind til dem-

01:25:34.588 --> 01:25:37.465
-og slog dem hårdt over knoerne.

01:25:38.550 --> 01:25:45.515
Når børnene så de blå mærker,
vidste de, at hun var der.

01:25:45.933 --> 01:25:50.603
Så ville de ikke være ulydige igen.

01:25:51.814 --> 01:25:58.277
Efter Bosnien
følte jeg mig fortabt.

01:25:58.654 --> 01:26:03.908
I could not get a job.

01:26:04.284 --> 01:26:10.081
The job I got was as a night watchman
the municipal morgue.

01:26:10.499 --> 01:26:17.171
My friends thought it was crazy, so they
started calling me Baba Yaga.

01:26:17.548 --> 01:26:23.386
They seemed enough, it was fun when I
swept the floor with my broom.

01:26:23.762 --> 01:26:27.807
I decided
to pay them a visit.

01:26:28.100 --> 01:26:31.060
I beat them over the knuckles.

01:26:31.353 --> 01:26:35.731
I cut the heads off them.

01:26:36.024 --> 01:26:38.734
My friends made me just a joke.

01:26:38.944 --> 01:26:42.280
You and your friends
trying to crucify me.

01:26:42.531 --> 01:26:46.534
I do not know what you're talking about.
I have nothing to do with it.

01:26:49.705 --> 01:26:53.082
Wait! Listen now!
I have kids.

01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:59.463
-Have you?
-I have a wife, a little boy. . .

01:27:00.799 --> 01:27:04.468
. . .og en lille pige.
Gør ikke det her.

01:27:06.638 --> 01:27:10.266
Syntes l ikke, at det var vigtigt?

01:27:10.559 --> 01:27:15.271
Call Dekker. The game is over.
l must download family.

01:27:15.606 --> 01:27:20.693
No! If l touches my family
I'll kill you!

01:27:27.993 --> 01:27:31.913
Nevermind. It's him.

01:27:32.206 --> 01:27:34.582
Jeg ville netop ringe.

01:27:34.791 --> 01:27:38.169
Dekker? Dekker? Fandens.

01:27:44.468 --> 01:27:46.844
Den ringer.

01:28:45.112 --> 01:28:48.823
Crowe, vi smutter.

01:29:09.011 --> 01:29:11.053
Come on!

01:29:24.109 --> 01:29:26.944
-Tag den her på.
-Glem det.

01:29:28.322 --> 01:29:31.157
Tag den nu på!

01:29:34.828 --> 01:29:37.288
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

01:29:47.716 --> 01:29:51.093
Shut them out!

01:30:10.739 --> 01:30:12.907
Af sted!

01:30:37.557 --> 01:30:41.268
-Will, han flygter.
-Han er væk.

01:30:41.561 --> 01:30:44.188
We will block the road.

01:31:00.330 --> 01:31:03.332
Damn!

01:31:18.598 --> 01:31:20.808
Come on!

01:33:16.383 --> 01:33:18.676
Strømer!

01:33:23.557 --> 01:33:28.185
Do you want me?
Do you love it?

01:33:43.451 --> 01:33:46.161
So come and get me.

01:34:22.991 --> 01:34:25.701
Open your eyes.

01:34:27.495 --> 01:34:30.539
Open your damn eyes.

01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:40.382
I told you
that it would go like this.

01:34:45.013 --> 01:34:47.431
Do it with him.

01:34:52.854 --> 01:34:55.606
Do it with him!

01:34:56.524 --> 01:35:00.444
Skyd ham, for helvede!

01:35:51.454 --> 01:35:54.623
Er det ham?

01:36:14.310 --> 01:36:18.480
Can you recognize me white?

01:36:20.650 --> 01:36:25.696
Folk siger, at jeg ligner
min lillebror, bare flottere.

01:36:28.283 --> 01:36:31.952
Tror du, at du er
kvarterets styggeste?

01:36:32.245 --> 01:36:37.499
Det her er New Orleans.
Du har ikke set noget endnu.

01:36:37.834 --> 01:36:40.961
Få ham ind i bilen.

01:36:42.130 --> 01:36:44.590
Wait!

01:36:44.758 --> 01:36:49.303
Here is how can l do to me.
Let me go.

01:36:51.890 --> 01:36:55.225
Assholes!

01:37:48.363 --> 01:37:50.906
Wish you something, honey.

01:37:58.540 --> 01:38:01.959
Happy birthday
princess.

01:38:05.588 --> 01:38:09.007
We will have cupcakes.

01:38:09.217 --> 01:38:15.264
-Hey, where are you going?
"I just wanted to deliver. . .

01:38:15.640 --> 01:38:22.187
This is for Sara. It is a
pet cats and dogs.

01:38:22.605 --> 01:38:27.818
-She will probably love it.
"I'm not so good at such things.

01:38:30.989 --> 01:38:34.908
Thank you. I do not know what I
else to say. Many thanks.

01:38:35.201 --> 01:38:39.788
Mrs. Genz, remember me, your husband?

01:38:40.123 --> 01:38:45.377
-Vi var lige ved at gå...
-Så havde du fået med den her.

01:38:45.712 --> 01:38:48.964
It's my turn.

01:38:49.215 --> 01:38:51.258
-Where am I lucky.
-Yes, sir.

01:38:51.467 --> 01:38:55.053
I will let you have peace.
I would just drop it there.

01:38:55.305 --> 01:39:00.893
-Will not you stay?
-No, I'm little. . . busy.

01:39:02.770 --> 01:39:06.982
-You can come back later.
-Yes.

01:39:07.317 --> 01:39:10.611
Okay, I'll follow you out.

01:39:12.447 --> 01:39:17.492
-She's back.
-Better, stronger and faster.

01:39:20.830 --> 01:39:27.044
-Is everything okay?
"I'm still a little shaken.

01:39:28.504 --> 01:39:31.423
I know.

01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:39.181
"I thought it was over.
"But it was not.

01:39:39.599 --> 01:39:44.686
You're doing it.
It takes just a little time.

01:39:49.567 --> 01:39:55.113
I will go.
And you must enter them.

01:39:55.490 --> 01:40:00.535
-What are you so afraid of?
-That one.

01:40:00.828 --> 01:40:04.456
-Sissy.
-Yes you are right.

01:40:04.749 --> 01:40:08.168
Do not worry, partner.
