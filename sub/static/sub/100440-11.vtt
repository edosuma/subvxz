00:34.469 --> 00:35.687
Where...

00:35.731 --> 00:38.299
the hell am I?

00:40.344 --> 00:42.520
Hello?!

00:45.741 --> 00:48.483
I was just like you.

00:49.484 --> 00:51.268
20 minutes ago.

00:51.312 --> 00:54.663
Woke up here in shock,
no idea where I was.

00:55.707 --> 00:57.709
I came over, gave you a nudge.

00:59.363 --> 01:02.105
But you were busy producing
a puddle of drool.

01:02.149 --> 01:04.977
Honestly, who am I to interrupt?

01:08.720 --> 01:11.114
Gray.

01:11.158 --> 01:12.855
It's an interesting choice.

01:12.898 --> 01:15.814
It's supposed to be
psychologically oppressive.

01:16.859 --> 01:18.382
But I like gray.

01:18.426 --> 01:19.514
So there.

01:25.607 --> 01:27.652
I know you.

01:28.697 --> 01:30.090
You're The Merchant.

01:30.133 --> 01:32.657
You tried to kill Desi.

01:32.701 --> 01:35.095
Who?

01:35.138 --> 01:36.444
Listen, I'm...

01:36.487 --> 01:38.620
I'm genuinely sorry.

01:38.663 --> 01:40.448
I...

01:40.491 --> 01:43.799
I-I meet a lot of people
in my line of work.

01:43.842 --> 01:45.453
So...

01:45.496 --> 01:47.498
if you wouldn't mind
being a bit more specific.

01:49.413 --> 01:52.721
Where the hellare we?!

01:52.764 --> 01:54.375
I have no idea.

01:54.418 --> 01:55.376
You're a liar!

01:55.419 --> 01:56.725
What do you wantfrom me?

01:58.422 --> 02:00.381
Uh...

02:00.424 --> 02:02.296
I want you to let go.

02:02.339 --> 02:04.298
Please.

02:05.560 --> 02:08.563
Clearly, you and I are
in the same predicament.

02:08.606 --> 02:11.392
It's just I'd say I'm
handling it a bit better.

02:11.435 --> 02:13.568
Eh? Without all the
grabbing and shouting

02:13.611 --> 02:16.658
and toxic masculinity.

02:21.880 --> 02:23.273
This coming from the man

02:23.317 --> 02:25.188
who murdered a woman
in a soccer stadium.

02:26.233 --> 02:27.886
Was that you?

02:27.930 --> 02:30.541
On the soccer pitch.

02:30.585 --> 02:32.978
Oh, right.

02:33.022 --> 02:35.720
You're that teenager
from the, um...

02:35.764 --> 02:38.506
from the Falcon organization.

02:39.550 --> 02:40.551
Fal...

02:40.595 --> 02:42.988
Phoenix... Foundation.

02:43.032 --> 02:46.035
You're the criminally insaneweasel
on the run from Codex.

02:46.078 --> 02:47.384
I don't like that word.

02:47.428 --> 02:49.560
What, "weasel"?"Insane."

02:49.604 --> 02:52.302
It's a simple word
stupid people use

02:52.346 --> 02:53.714
when they can't face
the complexities

02:53.738 --> 02:54.783
of the human psyche.

02:54.826 --> 02:57.873
"Sociopath"...
There's another one.

02:57.916 --> 02:59.396
It's like, "Everyone, calm down.

02:59.440 --> 03:01.746
Stop trying to label me."

03:01.790 --> 03:05.010
What was the last thing
that you remember?

03:05.054 --> 03:07.622
I was drinking a cup of tea,

03:07.665 --> 03:08.753
oolong,

03:08.797 --> 03:11.626
in a Shanghai cafe.

03:11.669 --> 03:13.889
Everything went dark.

03:13.932 --> 03:16.457
I woke up, I was being
transported somewhere,

03:16.500 --> 03:18.023
then held.

03:20.025 --> 03:21.375
I really don't know.

03:21.418 --> 03:23.072
I just...

03:23.115 --> 03:26.031
found myself coming to here.

03:27.555 --> 03:28.860
You?

03:28.904 --> 03:31.341
I was in China, tracking you.

03:31.385 --> 03:33.038
Oh, were you?

03:33.082 --> 03:36.433
Well, serves you right, then,
doesn't it?

03:36.477 --> 03:38.914
You're bleeding, by the way.

03:45.312 --> 03:46.878
Oh, look.

03:46.922 --> 03:49.185
I've got one, too.
Twinsies.

03:50.969 --> 03:52.710
There's something sewn in

03:52.754 --> 03:54.495
under the skin.Please.

03:54.538 --> 03:56.584
Please stop poking it.

03:56.627 --> 03:59.064
It's a planted port.

03:59.108 --> 04:01.589
Oh, you mean
there's an IV in here?

04:01.632 --> 04:03.591
Yeah.

04:03.634 --> 04:06.811
Yeah, that explains
why we're so disoriented.

04:07.943 --> 04:10.337
We've been drugged.

04:11.381 --> 04:12.730
Judging by the stitches,

04:12.774 --> 04:14.906
I'd say we've been here a week.

04:14.950 --> 04:17.518
I don't...

04:17.561 --> 04:19.433
I don't want to be in this cell.

04:19.476 --> 04:21.957
I really...

04:22.000 --> 04:25.352
I really don't want
to be in this cell.

04:27.354 --> 04:30.661
Yeah, well, neither do I.

04:30.705 --> 04:34.622
And I got a bad
feelingnobody's coming for us.

04:34.665 --> 04:38.539
Which means our only hope
of getting out of here...

04:38.582 --> 04:40.584
is each other.

04:43.326 --> 04:45.285
♪

05:12.616 --> 05:14.575
Got it.

05:14.618 --> 05:16.054
Got what?

05:16.098 --> 05:18.622
Oh, t... I told you
to stop poking that.

05:18.666 --> 05:19.841
That's just...

05:19.884 --> 05:21.364
Try...

05:21.408 --> 05:23.279

05:23.323 --> 05:25.629

05:29.111 --> 05:30.721
Keeping hold of that, are we?

05:30.765 --> 05:32.723
Never know.
Might come in handy.

05:36.031 --> 05:37.337
No, I kn...

05:37.380 --> 05:38.425
I know who you are.

05:38.468 --> 05:39.730
You're that bloke

05:39.774 --> 05:41.602
that makes things
out of things, right?

05:41.645 --> 05:43.299
You're like,

05:43.343 --> 05:45.214
"I-I got a toothbrush,

05:45.257 --> 05:47.782
"I got some bubblegum, some
duct tape and some earwax,

05:47.825 --> 05:49.218
"and, hey, hey, presto,
I just made

05:49.261 --> 05:50.524
an aeroplane."

05:52.874 --> 05:54.658
Let go of me!
I don't speak crazy!

05:54.702 --> 05:56.399
Get him off me!
Get him off me!

05:56.443 --> 05:58.183
Get him off me! Calm down! Calm down!

05:58.227 --> 05:59.247
I can't calm down! Just...

05:59.271 --> 06:01.143
listento my voice, okay?

06:01.186 --> 06:03.624
- I find it irritating.
- Please be quiet.

06:05.669 --> 06:07.236
My name is Angus.

06:07.279 --> 06:08.629
What's your name?

06:14.330 --> 06:17.289
What are you trying to do, get
me to laugh myself to death?

06:17.333 --> 06:20.031
That's terrible, that is.

06:20.075 --> 06:23.600
What, they named you after beef?

06:23.644 --> 06:26.647
Pretty sureit's Scottish.

06:30.738 --> 06:33.610
My name's Clive.

06:33.654 --> 06:35.525
It's not an alias.

06:35.569 --> 06:38.702
Well, Clive, just...

06:38.746 --> 06:40.225
make sureto breathe deep...

06:40.269 --> 06:42.750
Why don't you shut up and
let me listen to the birds?

06:44.404 --> 06:46.754
I like listening to the birds.

06:49.365 --> 06:50.671
What birds?

06:50.714 --> 06:52.673
Shh.

06:52.716 --> 06:55.110
Listen to that.
You hear that?

06:57.199 --> 06:59.984
That's a reed parrotbill.

07:03.205 --> 07:04.728
And the other one, the...

07:04.772 --> 07:06.164
That's a bunting.

07:07.209 --> 07:08.384
That'sa Tibetan bunting.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.477
I think we're still in China.

07:22.093 --> 07:23.704
Birds migrate,

07:23.747 --> 07:26.271
but there is a way to confirm
if what you're saying is true.

07:32.887 --> 07:34.062
What are you doing?

07:36.673 --> 07:37.848
Shh!

07:47.118 --> 07:48.337
Oi. N-No, no, no.

07:50.557 --> 07:52.080
Oh, that's incredible.

07:52.123 --> 07:55.170
This pipe most likely runs
throughout the entire prison.

07:55.213 --> 07:56.301
So...

07:56.345 --> 07:58.173
if I create a seal between

07:58.216 --> 07:59.609
my ear and this hole...

07:59.653 --> 08:02.612
No. No,
it's incredibly unhygienic.

08:02.656 --> 08:05.223
Your face is right next
to that bucket of wee.

08:09.140 --> 08:10.707
Speaking Mandarin.

08:10.751 --> 08:12.100
I told you.

08:12.143 --> 08:13.188
I told you, didn't I?

08:13.231 --> 08:15.320
So we arein China.

08:15.364 --> 08:17.148
When are they coming for you?

08:17.192 --> 08:18.846
Who?

08:18.889 --> 08:20.108
The Phoenix people.

08:20.151 --> 08:21.588
Yeah, they're not coming.

08:23.241 --> 08:24.416
Great.

08:26.462 --> 08:28.203
So what now?

08:28.246 --> 08:30.161
Why don't we talk
about the people

08:30.205 --> 08:32.337
who did this to us?

08:32.381 --> 08:34.078
Let's talk about Codex.

08:34.122 --> 08:36.167
What, you think this is Codex?

08:36.211 --> 08:38.953
How else do you explain the
twoof us in a cell together?

08:38.996 --> 08:41.346
I shut down their
match fixing operation.

08:41.390 --> 08:43.174
You lost a lot of money
for them.

08:43.218 --> 08:45.350
Our common enemy is Codex.

08:45.394 --> 08:47.439
Yeah, but I paid them back
since then, didn't I?

08:47.483 --> 08:48.615
And I've kept

08:48.658 --> 08:50.617
in their good graces.

08:50.660 --> 08:53.358
This is not Codex.

Hook, line and sinker.

Yeah. Yeah.

weather effects yesterday.

09:53.680 --> 09:55.246
Almost there.

with someone emotionally.

09:58.423 --> 09:59.511
Good for you.

10:04.212 --> 10:07.911
Exactly how much moneydid
you spend on this circus?

10:07.955 --> 10:09.826
Well,

10:09.870 --> 10:11.611
if Codex find a way to wipe out

10:11.654 --> 10:13.395
a quarter of the
Earth's population,

10:13.438 --> 10:16.398
I don't think I'm gonna care
too much about my bank balance.

Every time I think
we've knocked them back,

10:22.012 --> 10:24.449
they seem to come
back at us stronger.

10:24.493 --> 10:26.408
We need intel. We need...

10:26.451 --> 10:27.931
we need to get ahead of them.

10:27.975 --> 10:30.368
Because, without that,

Merchant in China? Yeah.

Techs found

11:39.307 --> 11:41.526
something unexpected.

11:41.570 --> 11:45.617
Encrypted messages sent
from The Merchant to Codex.

11:45.661 --> 11:47.421
MacGYVER: That doesn't make any sense.
After he lost

11:47.445 --> 11:49.621
Codex all that money in Milan,
they wanted him dead.

11:49.665 --> 11:51.643
Yeah, swapping messages
indicates that they've kissed

11:51.667 --> 11:53.625
and made up. That means...

11:53.669 --> 11:54.907
The Merchant possibly knows more

11:54.931 --> 11:56.454
about Codex
than we first thought.

Like the location
of their new headquarters.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.807
We're not gonna be able
to decrypt those messages.

12:00.850 --> 12:02.417
I've been working
on Major Frost's phone

12:02.460 --> 12:04.811

who took himor where he is.

12:21.653 --> 12:22.785
Right?

12:22.829 --> 12:24.023
So we can use that
to our advantage.

12:24.047 --> 12:25.440
Of course.

12:25.483 --> 12:27.485
Messing with him is part
of the interrogation.No.

12:27.529 --> 12:28.965
We don't interrogate him.

12:29.009 --> 12:30.488
We help him.

12:30.532 --> 12:31.751
Look, The Merchant may sound

12:31.794 --> 12:33.154
like a derangedchat show host, but

12:33.187 --> 12:34.797
he's highly intelligent,

12:34.841 --> 12:37.060
manipulative...
and trained by Codex.

12:37.104 --> 12:39.541
Traditional interrogationwon't work on him.

12:39.584 --> 12:41.848
Exactly what do you have
in mind?

12:43.893 --> 12:46.591
Uh, why are wein the storage bay?

12:46.635 --> 12:48.942
This is where we play
laser tag and defuse bombs.

12:48.985 --> 12:51.727
Right. We canput the, uh...

12:51.771 --> 12:53.773
cell block here,

12:53.816 --> 12:57.994
hallway here, a little bit
of, uh, fake sunlight.

12:58.038 --> 12:59.430
This'll be perfect.

12:59.474 --> 13:01.432
You want to build a prison?

13:01.476 --> 13:04.958
A prison set...
for our beautiful con.

13:05.001 --> 13:06.524
The Merchant isn'tgoing to wake up

13:06.568 --> 13:07.850
in the Phoenixinterrogation room.

13:07.874 --> 13:10.093
He's going to wake upin
a cell somewhere else.

13:10.137 --> 13:11.747
Yes. In China.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.749
With me as his cellmate.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.316
Social engineering.

13:15.359 --> 13:17.535
We gain his trust,
get him to talk a little bit.

13:17.579 --> 13:19.581
Perhaps he even gives up
the, uh,

13:19.624 --> 13:21.104
location of Codex without him

13:21.148 --> 13:22.845
even realizing it.

13:22.889 --> 13:27.719
I'll be the Phoenix agent
who pursues him, and once

13:27.763 --> 13:30.418
we are trapped together,
I'll become his confidant.

13:30.461 --> 13:32.463
It should be me.

13:35.249 --> 13:37.569
The Merchant needs to believe
that his cellmate is an ally.

13:37.599 --> 13:40.297
And Codex's master planwas designed by...

13:40.341 --> 13:42.517
my mother.

13:42.560 --> 13:44.867
And... my aunt
runs the place, so,

13:44.911 --> 13:46.869
Codex is practically
the family business.

13:46.913 --> 13:48.479
No, Mac.

13:48.523 --> 13:51.918
You've been through
a lot lately, and, um...

13:51.961 --> 13:55.008
this hits a bit close to home.Exactly.

13:55.051 --> 13:56.792
It'll make it more convincing.

13:56.836 --> 13:59.490
Look, I've run this con before
with MI6.

14:00.535 --> 14:02.102
I have experience.

14:02.145 --> 14:03.364
Ican handle this.

14:03.407 --> 14:04.756
You're not strong enough.

14:04.800 --> 14:06.889
Look, forgive me, but

14:06.933 --> 14:08.345
after everything you've
been through recently,

14:08.369 --> 14:10.371
I just don't think
that you have the...

14:10.414 --> 14:11.763
Don't have the what?

14:11.807 --> 14:15.202
The mental stability
that this requires.

14:20.294 --> 14:21.773
You're right.

14:23.471 --> 14:25.536
I'm not sleeping, and I can't
stop thinking about Codex,

14:25.560 --> 14:27.200
or the people
that they want to sacrifice.

14:28.955 --> 14:30.870
Or the people that
I've lost, so...

14:30.913 --> 14:33.829
Let me use it, please.

14:35.483 --> 14:36.939
If The Merchant's emotional
intelligence is as high

14:36.963 --> 14:38.375
as you say,
then he's gonna look at me,

14:38.399 --> 14:39.966
and he's gonna see
a kindred spirit.

14:40.009 --> 14:42.969
Someone who's pushed to the
edge, just trying to survive.

14:54.458 --> 14:56.460
You'll need to look the part.

14:58.201 --> 15:00.595
We'll suggest
you two were drugged,

15:00.638 --> 15:02.249
which will account
for the lost time,

15:02.292 --> 15:03.598
and provide physical evidence

15:03.641 --> 15:05.382
that'll seem too insane to fake.

15:05.426 --> 15:08.995
When we abducted him, we found
anti-anxiety medication.

15:09.038 --> 15:11.780
Withholding that will
throw him off his game.

15:11.823 --> 15:13.434
Bozer will head up
production design.

15:13.477 --> 15:15.958
Layer the dirt on those walls.
This is all about the details.

15:16.002 --> 15:17.786
Where's my rodent guy?

15:17.829 --> 15:19.875
We'll need the proper lighting
and atmosphere.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.877
This rig will use nanoparticlesto compress

15:21.921 --> 15:23.899
what happens to sunlightas
it passes through the Earth's

15:23.923 --> 15:26.969
atmosphere over six miles
down into a few feet.

15:27.013 --> 15:29.078
We'll have surveillance,
but you'll be in close quarters

15:29.102 --> 15:32.192
with The Merchant, so
that means no comms. You need

15:32.235 --> 15:34.063
to establish a rapport.

15:34.107 --> 15:36.196
Normally, I'd say use

15:36.239 --> 15:38.328
emotive mirroring, active listening,

15:38.372 --> 15:40.156
but we're short on time, so,

15:40.200 --> 15:41.636
get him to tell you his name.

15:41.679 --> 15:43.116
All right.

16:02.918 --> 16:05.007
Hello, Clive.

16:05.051 --> 16:07.357
They messed you up
pretty good, huh?

16:07.401 --> 16:10.534
Did you find out where we are?

16:10.578 --> 16:11.927
Who they are?

16:11.971 --> 16:13.711
What-what they want from us?

16:15.757 --> 16:18.716
We're being heldby China's Ministry

16:18.760 --> 16:21.937
of State Security.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.983
The secret police.

16:24.026 --> 16:26.855
Yeah. They think
we're Western spies.

16:26.898 --> 16:29.031
Well, you area Western spy.

16:29.075 --> 16:31.077
Yeah.

16:31.120 --> 16:34.036
Well... I was.

16:34.080 --> 16:36.038
How so?

16:36.082 --> 16:39.085
I defected from the Phoenix.

16:39.128 --> 16:41.652
And I've been tracking you

16:41.696 --> 16:44.394
because I need your help...

16:44.438 --> 16:46.701
making contact with Titan.

16:52.098 --> 16:54.448
And why on earth would you wantto do that?

16:54.491 --> 16:57.799
So that I can join Codex.

16:57.842 --> 17:00.062
He pushed it.
That was too early.

17:00.106 --> 17:02.064
No, no, no, he's good.
He's gonna bite.

17:02.108 --> 17:04.762
Listen to me. Level with me.

17:04.806 --> 17:06.460
The Phoenix Foundation...

17:06.503 --> 17:08.244
They're really not coming
for you?

17:10.159 --> 17:12.031
Definitely not.

17:13.989 --> 17:16.600
Well, I can't tell you
how happy that makes me.

17:16.644 --> 17:18.994
But you know, there's
an easy-peasy solution

17:19.038 --> 17:20.952
to all of this, right?

17:20.996 --> 17:22.693
You make stuff out of stuff.

17:22.737 --> 17:23.955
That's what you do.

17:23.999 --> 17:26.001
So anyway, hypothetically,

17:26.045 --> 17:28.003
you could get us out
of this jail cell.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.092
Uh-oh. TAYLOR:
No, it's all right.

17:30.136 --> 17:30.962
We expected that. Stand by.

17:31.006 --> 17:32.138
MacGYVER:
Yeah, I...

17:32.181 --> 17:34.488
I might be ableto make what we need to

17:34.531 --> 17:37.143
pick that lock, break it
or something, yeah.

17:37.186 --> 17:39.580
Listen, when the
guards come back

17:39.623 --> 17:41.060
to interrogate one of us,

17:41.103 --> 17:43.149
if we distract them,
I could lift a stun gun.

17:46.935 --> 17:48.980
MacGYVER:
If you can lift the stun gun,

17:49.024 --> 17:51.809
I think we have all that we
needto get out of here, but...

17:51.853 --> 17:52.984
then what?

17:53.028 --> 17:54.290
Where do we go?

17:54.334 --> 17:56.075
Very good.

17:56.118 --> 17:58.164
Steering the conversation
back to the intel.

18:00.905 --> 18:02.864
You break us out of this prison,

18:02.907 --> 18:06.085
I'll take you to Titan
personally.

18:06.128 --> 18:08.130
We have a deal.

18:32.111 --> 18:33.895
One, two, three.

18:33.938 --> 18:35.026
Parrotbill.

18:37.072 --> 18:39.205
Four, five.

18:39.248 --> 18:40.728
Bunting.

18:42.338 --> 18:44.819
One, two, three. Parrotbill.

19:06.232 --> 19:07.842
What the devil
is Clive playing at?

19:07.885 --> 19:08.973
The kind of stuff

19:09.017 --> 19:11.411
you dowhen you're crazy banana pants?

19:11.454 --> 19:12.736
What are we gonna do
about the stun gun?

19:12.760 --> 19:14.283
The Merchant mentionedlifting it,

19:14.327 --> 19:16.167
but he's gonna know
pretty soonif it's a fake.

19:16.198 --> 19:17.610
Which is why it won't be.
DESI: We're gonna give

19:17.634 --> 19:19.419
a real weapon
to the Downton Abbeyreject

19:19.462 --> 19:20.744
in there? MATTY: No, we're not gonna

19:20.768 --> 19:22.857
do that,
because that's too dangerous.

19:22.900 --> 19:25.294
Look, The Merchant thinks that
Mac's gonna help him escape.

19:25.338 --> 19:26.774
He won't hurt him.

19:26.817 --> 19:29.211
It's a risk
we're gonna have to take.

19:29.255 --> 19:31.344
Right.

19:31.387 --> 19:34.129
Time for sunset.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.391
But it's only beena few hours

19:35.435 --> 19:36.827
in that cell since sunrise.

19:36.871 --> 19:39.526
Yes, well, I'm throwing
off his circadian rhythms,

19:39.569 --> 19:41.049
adding a lightning storm

19:41.092 --> 19:44.792
and dosing his dinner with his

19:44.835 --> 19:46.576
anti-anxiety medication.

19:46.620 --> 19:49.797
The benzo hit should
triggerfeelings of tranquility,

19:49.840 --> 19:51.755
and make him trust Maceven more.

19:51.799 --> 19:55.455
Something about youplaying God is...
terrifying.

19:55.498 --> 19:56.891
Well, it is a chess match.

19:56.934 --> 19:58.477
We have to do whatever
we can to make sure

19:58.501 --> 20:00.895
that Mac is not the pawn.

20:14.778 --> 20:16.345
I can't bear awkward silences.

20:18.173 --> 20:21.132
Listen, why don't you tell me
a little bit about yourself?

20:21.176 --> 20:24.832
I'm just interested to know... what
makes the Boy Wonder tick?

20:26.181 --> 20:27.922
Seriously, what...?

20:29.184 --> 20:30.968
What are your hopes?
What are your dreams?

20:31.012 --> 20:33.144
To get you to stop talking.

20:33.188 --> 20:35.886
Just tell me one thing.

20:35.930 --> 20:37.714
Why do you want to meet Titan?

20:38.802 --> 20:41.805
Why would you want to go
face-to-face

20:41.849 --> 20:45.113
with the architect
of Codex's doomsday plans?

20:45.156 --> 20:48.116
She's my aunt.

20:48.159 --> 20:50.161
Like hell she is.

20:57.038 --> 20:58.822
You're telling the truth?

20:58.866 --> 21:00.911
I really wish I wasn't.

21:00.955 --> 21:03.479
So it's a family matter.

21:06.177 --> 21:08.092
Well, what do

21:08.136 --> 21:09.659
your parents say? Do they know?

21:10.704 --> 21:12.706
Siblings?

21:15.752 --> 21:18.233
I see. None of those.

21:18.277 --> 21:21.018
So...

21:21.062 --> 21:23.456
you're all alone in the world.

21:25.806 --> 21:27.677
I wouldn't say that.

21:27.721 --> 21:29.853
Listen,
family's important, but...

21:29.897 --> 21:31.333
Even if you don't get along.

21:31.377 --> 21:33.030
But when they're gone,

21:33.074 --> 21:36.033
well, it's like you're-you're
the last of your kind.

21:36.077 --> 21:38.732
Literally. You're like
an endangered species.

21:39.994 --> 21:42.475
It's just you,

21:42.518 --> 21:45.304
left to wander the wilderness

21:45.347 --> 21:48.698
until you finally die
and become extinct.

21:49.743 --> 21:51.484
I want to pull Macout of there.

21:51.527 --> 21:53.268
It's too soon.
They're building trust.

21:53.312 --> 21:54.985
No, he's losing control
of the conversation.

21:55.009 --> 21:56.271
Give us the room.

22:01.581 --> 22:03.713
You said you did this op at MI6.

22:04.758 --> 22:06.020
I did.

22:06.063 --> 22:07.456
And?

22:07.500 --> 22:09.066
It was successful.

22:11.025 --> 22:12.896
Until it wasn't.

22:12.940 --> 22:14.613
I locked one of our best
operational officers in

22:14.637 --> 22:16.683
with a terrorist in the hope
of getting some intel

22:16.726 --> 22:19.033
on an upcoming attack.

22:19.076 --> 22:20.121
What happened?

22:20.164 --> 22:22.602
My officer's jugular
was sliced open

22:22.645 --> 22:24.168
with a shard of broken glass.

22:24.212 --> 22:26.388
We...

22:26.432 --> 22:28.042
we missed it.

22:28.085 --> 22:30.392
And now we're gonna put a
weaponin The Merchant's hands.

22:30.436 --> 22:32.829
But we managed to getenough
intel to stop the attack.

22:32.873 --> 22:35.354
Taylor, I know you well enough
now to know.

22:35.397 --> 22:37.094
You're worried.

22:37.138 --> 22:41.011
Which is why I want to
pull Macout of there.

22:41.055 --> 22:43.492
She told me about
you once, you know.

22:43.536 --> 22:45.146
'Course, I didn't
know at the time

22:45.189 --> 22:47.017
that youwere the famous nephew.

22:47.061 --> 22:48.323
What do you mean?

22:48.367 --> 22:49.933
Auntie Gwen.

22:49.977 --> 22:51.674
Oh, uh, um, we're not close

22:51.718 --> 22:52.999
or any...
Actually, she doesn't like...

22:53.023 --> 22:54.460
Actually, she wants to kill me.

22:54.503 --> 22:55.896
What did she say?

22:55.939 --> 22:57.352
Well, as you know,
she's so dedicated

22:57.376 --> 22:59.334
to saving the world from itself.

22:59.378 --> 23:02.990
I was curious to find out why.

23:03.033 --> 23:04.948
So I asked her.

23:04.992 --> 23:07.429
And she told me.

23:07.473 --> 23:10.693
She said... and I quote...

23:10.737 --> 23:13.783
"I want my nephew to have
a long and beautiful life.

23:13.827 --> 23:16.482
"And I want that
for his children

23:16.525 --> 23:19.006
and for his
children's children."

23:19.049 --> 23:19.920
Me?

23:19.963 --> 23:22.226
Me? I'm all about survival.

23:22.270 --> 23:24.751
Is that how you got back
with Codex,

23:24.794 --> 23:25.926
back in their...

23:25.969 --> 23:27.971
good graces?

23:30.757 --> 23:31.975
Well, I mustn't lie.

23:32.019 --> 23:34.456
I've got a certain skill set
that they need,

23:34.500 --> 23:38.155
and that's reserved me a seatin
the doomsday bunker, luckily.

23:40.070 --> 23:43.030
Did you hear that?

23:43.073 --> 23:44.466
They have a doomsday bunker.

23:44.510 --> 23:45.685
Already on it.

23:45.728 --> 23:47.271
Tracking all shipments
from the past year

23:47.295 --> 23:50.994
of materials needed to build
afortified underground structure.

23:51.038 --> 23:52.648
Good job, Mac.

23:52.692 --> 23:54.824
Old Clive is giving up
valuable intel,

23:54.868 --> 23:56.565
and he doesn't even realize it.

23:56.609 --> 23:58.001
A doomsday bunker?

23:58.045 --> 24:00.134
How long do we have
to get into that thing?

24:02.963 --> 24:04.573
Time-out.

24:05.618 --> 24:07.837
Why?

24:07.881 --> 24:11.101
Why now? Why-why do you...

24:11.145 --> 24:13.930
want to join Codex now?

24:28.815 --> 24:32.166
My whole life,
I've been a Boy Scout.

24:34.560 --> 24:37.911
Trying to make my... saintly

24:37.954 --> 24:39.913
dead mom proud.

24:39.956 --> 24:42.263
But now that I know
the truth about her

24:42.306 --> 24:46.049
and both of my parents
are dead...

24:48.138 --> 24:49.923
I feel...

24:49.966 --> 24:51.968
free.

24:54.188 --> 24:57.713
Free to choosethe path
of science and reason.

24:57.757 --> 25:00.716
And the whole...

25:00.760 --> 25:04.328
"Codex planningon killing
billions of people"?

25:05.373 --> 25:07.549
Your friends.

25:07.593 --> 25:09.986
Phoenix.

25:10.030 --> 25:12.859
Your girlfriend.

25:14.861 --> 25:16.993
What, that doesn't bother you?

25:17.037 --> 25:19.169
Sometimes, to do what's right,

25:19.213 --> 25:22.129
you have to sacrifice
the things you love.

25:23.173 --> 25:25.219
Is that part of the act?

25:25.262 --> 25:27.221
Well, let's hope so.

25:27.264 --> 25:28.788
Enough with the sharing.

25:29.876 --> 25:32.269
Let's set this breakout
in motion, hmm?

25:37.579 --> 25:39.015
Uh, just...

25:46.545 --> 25:48.024
Thing is,
I haven't learned Mandarin

25:48.068 --> 25:49.915
since the last time you were
in here, so I've got no idea

25:49.939 --> 25:51.854
what you're talking about.

25:52.855 --> 25:54.814
Thanks.

25:54.857 --> 25:56.835
I take it you guys ran withthe
whole prison breakout thing,

25:56.859 --> 25:58.078
came up with a plan? Yeah.

25:58.121 --> 25:59.272
Bozer's waiting in the lab
to brief you.

25:59.296 --> 26:01.255
Mac, mate, are you okay?

26:01.298 --> 26:02.343
Yeah, I'm fine.

26:02.386 --> 26:04.693
Ready for a few more cutsand bruises.

26:17.140 --> 26:18.533
Well, well, well.

26:18.577 --> 26:22.189
You seem to be rather
goodat withstanding torture.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.062
So do you.

26:26.106 --> 26:28.587
Mm. Mm-hmm.

26:28.630 --> 26:30.589
Anyhoo,

26:30.632 --> 26:31.938
got you a little gift, didn't I?

26:31.981 --> 26:34.505
Yeah.

26:34.549 --> 26:37.726
Saw it in the windowand I thought of you.

26:37.770 --> 26:38.727
Oh, bloody hell.

26:38.771 --> 26:40.511
It works.Shocking.

26:41.556 --> 26:43.297
All right. This time.

26:43.340 --> 26:45.821
Oh! Watch out, watch out.

26:45.865 --> 26:47.040
It is sensitive.

26:49.042 --> 26:51.566
Well, this is
a charged moment, isn't it?

26:55.048 --> 26:56.658
Sorry, I couldn't resist.

26:56.702 --> 26:58.355
You're no fun at all.

27:12.326 --> 27:15.198
Maybe you could explain to
mehow destroying our only weapon

27:15.242 --> 27:16.722
is gonna get us out of here.

27:16.765 --> 27:19.463
Gas cartridge plus needle...

27:19.507 --> 27:22.771
equals lock pick gun.

27:22.815 --> 27:24.860
A weapon is no use to us

27:24.904 --> 27:26.949
if we can't get out of here.

27:26.993 --> 27:28.734
Yeah, but a lock pickisn't gonna help us

27:28.777 --> 27:30.431
take out the guards, is it?

27:30.474 --> 27:32.999
No reason we can't have both.

27:34.304 --> 27:36.698
Now, most projectile stun guns,

27:36.742 --> 27:40.267
they have a direct
contact backup feature

27:40.310 --> 27:43.226
in case the cartridges
have been deployed.

27:44.184 --> 27:46.752
And you're arming me.

27:46.795 --> 27:49.145
Is that wise?

27:49.189 --> 27:50.862
You're an opportunist
who wants to capitalize

27:50.886 --> 27:53.193
on bringing me to Titan.

27:53.236 --> 27:55.674
I think it makes sense.

27:55.717 --> 27:58.024
Let's just call it trust, shall we?

27:59.678 --> 28:02.463
Pretty impressive skills, by the way.

28:03.638 --> 28:06.946
Gonna need those
as we cross into Zavkhan.

28:06.989 --> 28:09.949
He just dropped the name of
a remote province in Mongolia.

28:09.992 --> 28:11.124
I can cross-reference that

28:11.167 --> 28:13.082
with fallout shelter
material shipments

28:13.126 --> 28:14.736
and construction activity.

28:14.780 --> 28:16.477
Could give us a solid
location on Codex.

28:16.520 --> 28:19.262
Sir, there's a linein the
transcript from earlier

28:19.306 --> 28:21.284
that voice recognitionlogged as
inaudible... I'm busy right now.

28:21.308 --> 28:22.938
I checked the video,
just to cover our bases,

28:22.962 --> 28:25.747
and I found this.

28:25.791 --> 28:28.141
One, two, three, parrotbill...

28:28.184 --> 28:30.796
four, five...

28:30.839 --> 28:31.797
bunting.

28:31.840 --> 28:33.494
Cut the lines!

28:33.537 --> 28:35.235
The Internet!
The satellite!

28:35.278 --> 28:36.976
Cut the connection!
Seal us off now!

28:37.019 --> 28:39.108
What is it? What? What?
The Merchant is onto us.

28:39.152 --> 28:40.588
I don't know by how much,

28:40.631 --> 28:41.870
but he at least suspectsthat
he's been in a simulation.

28:41.894 --> 28:43.504
The intel he sent us is a trap.

28:43.547 --> 28:44.897
Okay, okay.
Just take a breath.

28:44.940 --> 28:45.898
Phoenix's network is protected

28:45.941 --> 28:48.422
by a sandboxed API, VPN, IDS.

28:48.465 --> 28:50.380
We should be o... What?

28:50.424 --> 28:51.860
Oh, this is never good. What is it?

28:51.904 --> 28:53.098
Someone got through
and pinged us.

28:53.122 --> 28:54.733
The Merchant sucked us
into this whole

28:54.776 --> 28:56.169
stun gun thing to get

28:56.212 --> 28:58.780
our focus away from
the real risk, the fake intel.

28:58.824 --> 28:59.888
Looks like someone beat
our network.

28:59.912 --> 29:01.217
My money's on Codex.

29:01.261 --> 29:02.610
He used us

29:02.653 --> 29:03.654
to send them an SOS.

29:03.698 --> 29:05.178
"Zavkhan" and "bunker"

29:05.221 --> 29:06.483
are trigger words.

29:06.527 --> 29:07.852
Anyone searchingfor those
words on the Internet

29:07.876 --> 29:09.269
will send an alarmto Codex.

29:09.312 --> 29:10.725
Anyone who sees the
networkwill know it's us.

29:10.749 --> 29:12.074
He's too valuable
of an asset to them.

29:12.098 --> 29:13.490
They're not gonna give him up.

29:13.534 --> 29:15.454
But if they have our location...
Codex is coming.

29:21.847 --> 29:24.545
♪

29:24.588 --> 29:27.591
Ten minutes ago,
someone searched keywords,

29:27.635 --> 29:30.072
triggering a distress beacon
in Los Angeles.

29:30.116 --> 29:32.074
We believe it to be
an asset of ours

29:32.118 --> 29:34.120
known simply as "The Merchant."

29:34.163 --> 29:39.081
We believe that he's being
heldby the Phoenix Foundation.

29:39.125 --> 29:41.997
Now, Titan wants him alive,

29:42.041 --> 29:45.131
by any means necessary.

29:45.174 --> 29:46.741
Are we clear?

29:46.785 --> 29:48.177
Yes, ma'am.

29:48.221 --> 29:49.526
Load up.

29:51.050 --> 29:54.836
I want to tell you something
in all honesty, which is

29:54.880 --> 29:56.727
a rare commodity; I mean,
it's an undervalued trait

29:56.751 --> 29:58.013
in today's society.

29:58.057 --> 29:59.425
Can't you just say
somethingwithout a preamble?

29:59.449 --> 30:01.843
Well, I can, but
I discovered years ago

30:01.887 --> 30:05.673
the pretty words make my
personality more palatable.

30:05.716 --> 30:07.762
Strange as it may sound,

30:07.806 --> 30:09.851
I actually have
high hopes for you.

30:09.895 --> 30:12.027
More than that,
I have faith in you.

30:12.071 --> 30:14.377
You will be free.

30:14.421 --> 30:17.772
I think you're gonna
make a great leader.

30:17.816 --> 30:20.122
And I think you're gonna
save an awful lot of people.

30:20.166 --> 30:22.777
At least I hope so.

30:22.821 --> 30:24.039
For both our sakes.

30:26.085 --> 30:27.869
All right, so... chance.

30:27.913 --> 30:28.977
Wait for 'em to go by again,

30:29.001 --> 30:30.959
then we take 'em by surprise.Okay.

30:32.178 --> 30:34.876
What are you doing?

30:34.920 --> 30:37.226
It's over.Bravo. Truly.

30:37.270 --> 30:40.055
Truly. Miss you already.
What are you doing?

30:40.099 --> 30:41.990
This isn't part of the plan.
He was about to give up...

30:42.014 --> 30:43.885
No, he made us hours ago.

30:43.929 --> 30:45.887
The info he gave you was a trap

30:45.931 --> 30:48.716
to send an SOS to Codex.
They're coming.

30:50.936 --> 30:53.721
All right, do we have
a black site ready?

30:53.764 --> 30:55.438
We need to transport
The Merchant out of here.

30:55.462 --> 30:57.657
Yeah, we're working on it,
butwe need a solid extraction plan

30:57.681 --> 30:59.007
in case we run into Codexon the way.

30:59.031 --> 30:59.988
Backup.
Why can't we call for backup?

31:00.032 --> 31:02.338
No.
Codex has infiltrated

31:02.382 --> 31:04.079
every level of
the government everywhere.

31:04.123 --> 31:05.230
We'd be calling in
reinforcements

31:05.254 --> 31:06.492
for them, not us. We're on our own.

31:06.516 --> 31:09.084
Oh, hello, Desiree.
Lovely to see you again.

31:09.128 --> 31:10.757
Don't you talk to her. She's lovely.
I can see why you're so devoted.

31:10.781 --> 31:12.740
Oh!

31:12.783 --> 31:13.959
Where's the Codex bunker?

31:14.002 --> 31:17.136
Tell me, or I swear to God... Calm down!

31:17.179 --> 31:19.094
Get off me.

31:19.138 --> 31:21.270
You are letting him
get to you. Calm down!

31:21.314 --> 31:22.619
I don't care. Get off me.

31:22.663 --> 31:23.707
Put him over there.

31:30.236 --> 31:33.195
Put chucklehead herein the war
room, with guards.

31:33.239 --> 31:34.980
Chucklehead? Really?

31:35.023 --> 31:36.416
You two. Ow!

31:36.459 --> 31:38.984
Make sure you lock
this building down

31:39.027 --> 31:40.507
while we come up with a plan.

31:45.120 --> 31:46.165
I'm good.

31:46.208 --> 31:47.644
I'm not.

31:51.779 --> 31:53.433
I'm sorry.

31:53.476 --> 31:55.130
It's been a rough
couple of days.

31:55.174 --> 31:57.021
I'm not allowed to lose my
cool every once in a while?

31:57.045 --> 31:59.830
Oh, you can. Just doesn't mean
it's not hard to watch.

31:59.874 --> 32:01.832
It's a part of an act.

32:01.876 --> 32:03.965
"Sacrifice the things you love."

32:04.009 --> 32:07.186
That's a confor The Merchant.

32:07.229 --> 32:09.318
Well, I believed you.

32:11.581 --> 32:14.628
I am losing my grip on which
version of you is real.

32:14.671 --> 32:17.936
The one who loves you is real.

32:22.114 --> 32:24.072
You can't just...

32:25.291 --> 32:27.554
We're in the middle...

32:30.339 --> 32:33.299
You love me?

32:36.128 --> 32:37.477
Well, cut it out.

32:37.520 --> 32:39.000
Ow.

32:39.044 --> 32:40.828
I'm sorry.

32:59.586 --> 33:01.544
Let's rendezvous
in the tech room

33:01.588 --> 33:03.131
after we lock the rest
of this place down.

33:03.155 --> 33:06.158
Hopefully, Matty has atransport
plan for The Merchant.

33:08.203 --> 33:10.205
Okay.

33:12.642 --> 33:15.167
Look at him,
he's just sittingin the war room,

33:15.210 --> 33:17.038
staring at us.

33:17.082 --> 33:20.041
I don't want to see his stupidface
any longer than I have to.

33:25.612 --> 33:27.005
We've got

33:27.048 --> 33:28.678
a black site in Tujungathat
will hold for the night.

33:28.702 --> 33:32.445
All right, people,
this is goingto be Convoy Security 101.

33:32.488 --> 33:33.620
Motion on the roof.

33:33.663 --> 33:35.361
They're here.

33:36.405 --> 33:38.059
I recognize her.

33:38.103 --> 33:40.366
Last time we met, she was
pointing a shotgun at me.

33:40.409 --> 33:42.518
Looks like they're gonna work their way
down from the roof. TAYLOR: All right,

33:42.542 --> 33:44.022
everyone, take positions.

34:10.135 --> 34:12.528
Find The Merchant.

34:12.572 --> 34:14.574
I'll take her.

34:20.145 --> 34:21.711
You have no idea

34:21.755 --> 34:24.192
how badly I wanted
to punch somebody today.

34:30.242 --> 34:32.157
On your left! Move, move! Get down!

34:40.121 --> 34:41.601
Cover me! Covering you!

34:41.644 --> 34:43.429
Move around the corner!

34:43.472 --> 34:45.953
Grenade! MAN: Go, go, go!

34:47.650 --> 34:48.651
Get down!

34:56.790 --> 34:58.705
Let's go! Go!

35:39.006 --> 35:40.964
Shame.

35:44.316 --> 35:46.100
What's this?

35:50.104 --> 35:52.367
Titan wants you to call her.

35:52.411 --> 35:54.413
Right.

36:02.247 --> 36:03.726
Hel-Hello?

36:03.770 --> 36:05.293
You're welcome.

36:05.337 --> 36:06.816
Oh, thank you.

36:06.860 --> 36:10.385
Thank-thank you so, so much.
Thank you.

36:10.429 --> 36:11.647
What'd you tell them?

36:11.691 --> 36:12.971
Oh, I didn't tell them anything.

36:12.996 --> 36:14.276
Well, I didn't
tell them anything

36:14.302 --> 36:15.521
they didn't know already.

36:15.564 --> 36:17.305
And-and obviously,
anything I did say

36:17.349 --> 36:20.613
to hedge my loyalty
to Codex, well,

36:20.656 --> 36:23.224
th-that was an act.
But you know that.

36:23.268 --> 36:25.226
Good.

36:25.270 --> 36:27.228
Listen, I-I know

36:27.272 --> 36:28.510
that we've had our
differences in the past.

36:28.534 --> 36:30.144
I just wanted to thank you

36:30.188 --> 36:31.754
for seeing your way
clear to, um...

36:33.278 --> 36:35.454
I think she rang off.

36:37.195 --> 36:39.327
Phew.

36:39.371 --> 36:41.373
Why aren't we moving?

36:46.334 --> 36:47.466
No.

36:47.509 --> 36:49.381
No, no, no.

36:49.424 --> 36:51.296
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

36:51.339 --> 36:53.341
You see, our Phoenix TAC team...

36:53.385 --> 36:55.387
The finest in the world,
might I add...

36:55.430 --> 36:57.258
Stopped your real saviors

36:57.302 --> 36:59.608
long before they ever hit
the ground.

36:59.652 --> 37:02.307
All the fighting, the gunfire.

37:04.134 --> 37:07.137
All right, team. All clear.

37:12.708 --> 37:13.927
Yes, well,

37:13.970 --> 37:16.234
good old Boze here, he staged

37:16.277 --> 37:17.496
that for your benefit

37:17.539 --> 37:19.933
using fake rounds
and blood squibs.

37:20.977 --> 37:22.414
But why?

37:22.457 --> 37:23.457
Why?

37:25.808 --> 37:27.549
That's why.

37:30.596 --> 37:32.032
The number he gave us

37:32.075 --> 37:33.618
links to a modem
on a protected network.

37:33.642 --> 37:36.384
Could it lead to the location
of Codex's new headquarters?

37:36.428 --> 37:38.778
It's buried under a few layers,
so it'll take some time.

37:38.821 --> 37:40.562
But I'll find 'em.

37:45.872 --> 37:47.874
Checkmate.

38:10.723 --> 38:12.899
Give it a rest, Riley.

38:12.942 --> 38:15.945
We got The Merchant, the intel

38:15.989 --> 38:17.599
and a handful
of Codex operatives.

38:17.643 --> 38:19.166
Take the night off.

38:19.209 --> 38:20.602
Oh, this isn't about Codex.

38:20.646 --> 38:22.561
I'm doing something
way more stressful.

38:22.604 --> 38:24.432
Apartment hunting.

38:24.476 --> 38:25.694
You're moving?

38:25.738 --> 38:27.261
You don't like my old room
at Mac's?

38:27.305 --> 38:28.456
Look, I know
that place is haunted,

38:28.480 --> 38:30.090
but that stupid priest
was supposed

38:30.133 --> 38:31.570
to take care of it.

38:31.613 --> 38:33.311
No, I...

38:33.354 --> 38:36.314
I just want to give Mac and
Desi the space they deserve.

38:36.357 --> 38:37.706
That's all.

38:37.750 --> 38:40.753
Is that whatyou're telling yourself?

38:43.408 --> 38:45.366
I don't know what
you're talking about.

38:55.376 --> 38:57.335
Don't make me say it.

38:57.378 --> 38:59.337
I won't.

38:59.380 --> 39:01.556
But...

39:01.600 --> 39:03.993
I'm here if you want to talk.

39:07.214 --> 39:09.477
Good night, Riley.

39:41.553 --> 39:44.338

40:07.187 --> 40:09.189
♪

40:17.502 --> 40:19.547
Earlier...

40:19.591 --> 40:21.201
what you said about
me being free

40:21.244 --> 40:23.464
and saving everyone,
what did you mean?

40:23.508 --> 40:26.859
Look, I'm knackered.

40:26.902 --> 40:28.469
Come and see me tomorrow.

40:28.513 --> 40:31.429
Nobody's coming for you, Clive.

40:31.472 --> 40:32.517
Ever.

40:38.392 --> 40:41.526
You know, you're just as trapped as I am.

40:41.569 --> 40:43.571
You just don't realize it.

40:45.007 --> 40:48.489
By your loyalties.

40:48.533 --> 40:52.667
You think that there'sonly
Phoenix and Codex.

40:52.711 --> 40:54.321
But there isn't.

40:58.543 --> 41:02.242
And what else is there?

41:07.508 --> 41:08.814
You.

41:11.381 --> 41:12.576
Let's forget our littlechess match

41:12.600 --> 41:14.515
for a minute, shall we?

41:14.559 --> 41:16.474
And let's pretend thatl
do actually care about

41:16.517 --> 41:18.780
the billions of innocent
soulson this planet.

41:18.824 --> 41:21.522
Well, they're gonna need
someonethat doesn't take sides.

41:21.566 --> 41:24.699
Someone who makesthe hard choices.

41:26.745 --> 41:28.747
I really believedthat person was you.

41:31.184 --> 41:32.707
But you're not ready.

41:32.751 --> 41:34.622
Is that so?

41:34.666 --> 41:37.146
Well, you know that storyl
told you about your aunt?

41:37.190 --> 41:39.845
Yeah, I made that up.

41:41.847 --> 41:45.546
And the reasonyou fell for it...

41:45.590 --> 41:48.593
is you wantedto believe it so badly.

41:50.682 --> 41:54.468
And it moved you,
and that's why you're weak.

41:54.512 --> 41:57.645
You're pretty soft yourself.

41:57.689 --> 41:59.667
When I fed you that lie
about wanting to join Codex,

41:59.691 --> 42:01.257
you lapped it up.

42:04.130 --> 42:06.567
Of course.

42:06.611 --> 42:09.222
You were lying.

42:09.265 --> 42:11.137
Sure.

42:15.271 --> 42:17.273
I was just like you.
