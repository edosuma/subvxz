Come on, Joe.
Buff that sucker.

00:02.990 --> 00:04.120
What'd I teach you?
(spits)

00:06.070 --> 00:07.000
(chuckles)
Sanitary.

00:07.190 --> 00:09.930
Is Joe applying for a job
in a train station in 1940?

00:09.930 --> 00:12.420
Just teaching him a few things
every man should know.

00:12.430 --> 00:13.900
Someone has
to get in there early,

00:13.900 --> 00:15.490
or sometimes the kid
turns out funny.

00:17.220 --> 00:18.320
Knock, knock.

00:18.450 --> 00:19.320
Hey, Phil.
Hey, guys.

00:19.500 --> 00:21.230
Phil, in here!

00:21.230 --> 00:23.130
PHIL: You ready
to tackle your website?

00:23.130 --> 00:24.290
I know I'm here a little early.

00:24.300 --> 00:25.380
I thought I was gonna be...

00:26.870 --> 00:28.510
Do you recognize that?

00:28.510 --> 00:30.140
Are you kidding?
I love your sauce.

00:30.140 --> 00:31.540
Some of it fell out
of my burrito last night,

00:31.540 --> 00:32.729
and I licked it
right off the remote.

00:32.740 --> 00:35.300
That's Auntie Alice's new sauce!

00:35.310 --> 00:37.410
She stole my recipe!

00:37.410 --> 00:38.910
I know.

00:38.920 --> 00:41.990
I am the crazy Colombian
that always loses her temper

00:41.990 --> 00:44.320
and needs to be calmed down
by the white people.

00:44.320 --> 00:46.580
No! I don't think
you're being crazy enough.

00:46.590 --> 00:48.990
I'm not a violent man, but
I know how nuts it can make you

00:48.990 --> 00:51.550
to create something special
only to have it stolen from you.

00:51.560 --> 00:55.490
Do you remember
a hit song called "Happy?"

00:55.500 --> 00:57.270
Yeah, it was
like a couple of years ago

00:57.270 --> 00:59.100
with the clapping and the hat.

00:59.100 --> 01:00.560
A couple of years ago, huh?

I really like this girl,

just so much pressure

Is there something wrong
with your air vents?

02:19.420 --> 02:21.420
No, Cam breathes through
his nose when he hides.

02:21.420 --> 02:24.250
A promposal?
To who? Laurie Vock?

02:24.250 --> 02:25.980
Oh, no.
She's Ian Jacobs' girl.

02:25.990 --> 02:27.860
Melanie Rylance?
You have to be careful with her.

02:27.860 --> 02:29.630
She has more cold sores
than Abby Burmeister.

02:29.630 --> 02:31.200
But seriously, Luke,
everything you say here

02:31.200 --> 02:32.790
is completely confidential.

02:32.800 --> 02:34.630
Oh, you know, they are looking
for chaperones for prom,

02:34.630 --> 02:36.330
and I thought maybe we could...

02:36.330 --> 02:37.960
No, we have tickets to the
opening of "Cabaret" that night.

02:37.970 --> 02:39.540
I'm not missing it
so I can tell some teenage girl

02:39.540 --> 02:40.800
to keep her dress on.

02:40.800 --> 02:42.200
I spent my own prom doing that.

02:42.210 --> 02:44.480
Okay, can I just point out
the absurdity

02:44.480 --> 02:48.970
that you ask this uncle to
advise you and not this uncle,

02:48.980 --> 02:51.980
who hung a Valentine's banner
outside of his office

02:51.980 --> 02:53.340
that said, "Mitchell,

02:53.350 --> 02:55.050
you're the best husband,
father, and lover."

02:55.050 --> 02:57.280
Didn't love all three of those
being rolled into one sentence.

02:57.290 --> 02:58.560
Sounded a little Ozark-y.

02:58.560 --> 03:00.290
No, Cam. Stop.
What?

03:00.290 --> 03:01.630
Luke's just looking
for an adviser

03:01.620 --> 03:02.820
who's a little more understated

03:02.830 --> 03:04.230
and a little less, you know...

03:04.230 --> 03:06.230
David Stuart.

Oh, I get it.

03:07.560 --> 03:09.490
He's quite gay.
Yes, I got it.

03:09.500 --> 03:10.870
Okay, well, you know what?

03:10.870 --> 03:12.240
I would hate to muck up
your promposal

03:12.240 --> 03:13.840
with my flair and panache.

03:13.840 --> 03:16.170
I'm sure the lucky girl
will swoon with delight

03:16.170 --> 03:17.470
when you use a mustard bottle

03:17.470 --> 03:19.470
to write "Wanna go?"
on her turkey burger.

03:19.480 --> 03:21.410

Hello?

03:21.410 --> 03:23.000
CLAIRE: There's an intruder
in the house.

03:23.010 --> 03:24.140
What?!

03:24.150 --> 03:25.720
But you have
nothing to worry about

03:25.720 --> 03:28.520
with Pritchett's
Guardian 3000 Closet,

03:28.520 --> 03:30.520
which doubles as
a military-grade panic room.

03:30.520 --> 03:32.590
So no intruder?
No!

03:32.590 --> 03:34.560
I'm just so excited
about this idea.

03:34.560 --> 03:35.890
I'm debuting it
next week at ClosetCon.

03:35.890 --> 03:37.050
What do you think?

03:37.060 --> 03:38.830
I think I'm studying for finals.

03:38.830 --> 03:40.730
Can't you scare the crap
out of a focus group?

03:40.730 --> 03:43.070
(doorbell rings)
Like I'm gonna share
my best closet idea

03:43.070 --> 03:44.430
with a room full of strangers

03:44.430 --> 03:46.560
four days before
the most hotly anticipated

03:46.570 --> 03:48.270

in North America.

04:05.690 --> 04:07.460
Sha-Na-nope.

04:09.960 --> 04:11.760
(computer beeps)
Hey, Jerry.

04:11.760 --> 04:15.290
For some reason,
I'm locked out of my computer.

04:15.300 --> 04:16.570
Apparently, someone tried

04:16.570 --> 04:19.070
to access my e-mail
before I got in.

04:19.070 --> 04:20.540
(sighs)

04:20.540 --> 04:24.640
Someone hell-bent
on leaking company secrets.

04:24.640 --> 04:29.070
It is four days until C-Con, and
Pritchett's Closets has a mole.

04:29.080 --> 04:31.280
No one is above suspicion.

04:31.280 --> 04:36.780
Margaret, where were you
this morning at 9:45 a.m.?

04:36.790 --> 04:38.560
MARGARET:
I'm so sorry I was late.

04:38.560 --> 04:40.260
I was at Overeaters Anonymous.

04:40.260 --> 04:42.830
I woke up
next to the ice cream again.

04:42.830 --> 04:44.630
So not Margaret.

04:51.630 --> 04:54.660
I know
who that locker belongs to.

04:54.670 --> 04:58.000
I can't believe you're asking
that cheap Ho to the prom.

04:58.010 --> 05:00.180
Cam!
Sarah Ho!

05:00.180 --> 05:02.850
She gave me a $5 gift card
for Teacher Appreciation Day.

05:02.850 --> 05:04.910
(birds cooing)
What's with the birds?

05:04.910 --> 05:06.480
Oh, these are
just some turtledoves

05:06.480 --> 05:08.410
for Manny's promposal.

05:08.420 --> 05:09.750
You're joking.

05:09.750 --> 05:11.680
You felt so slighted
over Luke asking me

05:11.690 --> 05:13.460
that you foisted yourself
on Manny?

05:13.460 --> 05:15.760
There was no foisting.

05:15.760 --> 05:17.360
I asked Manny if he needed help.

05:17.360 --> 05:20.160
He was too proud to admit
that he did, so here we are.

05:20.160 --> 05:22.090
Is it possible there's something
deeper going on with you

05:22.100 --> 05:23.470
around this whole prom area?

05:23.470 --> 05:25.440
Is it possible
you're second-guessing

05:25.440 --> 05:27.100
your no-frills approach?

05:27.100 --> 05:29.300
Especially compared
to turtledoves, backup dancers,

05:29.310 --> 05:32.510
and dry ice so Manny can appear
in a cloud of mist.

05:32.510 --> 05:33.810
A cloud of mist?

05:33.810 --> 05:35.210
Like in a movie?

05:35.210 --> 05:37.340
Is our thing
gonna seem lame now?

05:37.350 --> 05:38.650
Steady.

05:38.650 --> 05:40.620
Now, now.
I'm sure your thing is fine.

05:40.620 --> 05:42.520
What did
your little locker note say?

05:42.520 --> 05:43.790
"Go to the gym."

05:43.790 --> 05:45.020
Intriguing.

05:45.020 --> 05:46.550
What delights
await her in the gym?

05:46.560 --> 05:48.860
Another note telling her
to go to the parking lot.

05:48.860 --> 05:52.000
Well, I should help Manny
set up.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.160
Should I be worried?

05:53.160 --> 05:54.790
Don't freak me out right now,
okay?

05:54.800 --> 05:57.030
Okay. All right.
It's fine.
Just fine.

05:57.030 --> 06:00.130
You don't have to use it,
but at least you'll have it.

06:01.800 --> 06:04.500
Hello, Auntie Alice.

06:04.510 --> 06:07.240
Or should she say Auntie Malice?

06:07.240 --> 06:09.640
No, Gloria's right.
It's Alice.

06:09.650 --> 06:11.980
I didn't know you were in today.

06:11.980 --> 06:13.580
You're in...
Trouble!

06:13.580 --> 06:15.210
Is he okay?

06:15.220 --> 06:17.220
You stole my sauce!
What?

06:17.220 --> 06:20.360
Uh, I'm sorry.
Maybe you don't hear so good.

06:20.360 --> 06:24.260
She said, "You... stole...

06:24.260 --> 06:26.600
her... sauce."

06:28.900 --> 06:30.070
Wow.

06:30.070 --> 06:31.430
That's spicy.

06:31.430 --> 06:32.930
That's not the sauce she stole.

06:32.940 --> 06:34.700
That's her Volcano sauce.

06:34.700 --> 06:36.430
In her ad, one drop

06:36.440 --> 06:39.740
turns a hockey rink
into a swimming pool.

06:39.740 --> 06:43.610
It's her new sauce, the one
that tastes just like mine.

06:43.610 --> 06:45.740
How are you going
to explain that?

06:45.750 --> 06:47.720
Yeah, we want answers
and a little bread.

06:47.720 --> 06:51.390
Your fight's not with me.

06:51.390 --> 06:53.960
I'm not really Auntie Alice.

06:53.960 --> 06:55.890
Oh, come on.

06:55.890 --> 06:58.250
Your cute face is in the bottle!

06:58.260 --> 07:03.090
Auntie Alice is a brand that was
created by a big corporation.

07:03.100 --> 07:05.300
So they were the ones
who stole my sauce?

07:05.300 --> 07:07.600
They steal
all kinds of products.

07:07.600 --> 07:10.030
And they have an army of lawyers

07:10.040 --> 07:12.880
just ready to crush
anyone who challenges them.

07:12.880 --> 07:14.080
So we just have to take it?

07:14.080 --> 07:15.310
Ow!

07:15.310 --> 07:17.440
It's in my eye!
Oh!

07:17.450 --> 07:21.380
Please don't repeat any of this,
or I could lose my job.

07:21.380 --> 07:24.450
I'm still paying off
my improv classes.

07:24.450 --> 07:26.920
How is this food?!

07:26.920 --> 07:28.980
This will
probably be yours someday,

07:28.990 --> 07:30.820
so no reason
you shouldn't learn to do this.

07:30.830 --> 07:32.660
Does Manny
know how to change oil?

07:32.660 --> 07:34.120
Bath oils.
What?

07:34.130 --> 07:35.260
Bath oil?

07:35.260 --> 07:36.420
There's my guy.

07:36.430 --> 07:37.730
Let me grab the dipstick.

07:37.730 --> 07:38.960
This stick?

07:38.970 --> 07:41.340
Ow!

07:43.770 --> 07:45.900
Manny. Okay.
I just briefed the team.

07:45.910 --> 07:48.110
Dry ice is ready.
Bow ties are on the birds.

07:48.110 --> 07:49.470
Save it, Cam.

07:49.480 --> 07:50.780
Megan already said yes
to Shawn Reeves.

07:50.780 --> 07:52.120
He asked her last period.

07:52.120 --> 07:53.450
Oh, I'm so sorry, Manny.

07:53.450 --> 07:54.920
Can't really blame her.

07:54.920 --> 07:56.690
I mean, you try saying no
to Shawn Reeves

07:56.690 --> 07:59.020
with his weatherman smile
and his exotic Canadian accent.

07:59.020 --> 08:01.150
Well, there must be
someone else you can ask.

08:01.160 --> 08:03.590
No, that's okay.
There's always next year.

08:03.590 --> 08:05.590
At least this way I can see
the opening of "Cabaret."

08:05.600 --> 08:07.500
Oh, please.
It's just "Cabaret."

08:07.500 --> 08:09.630
It's been revived more times
than Dick Cheney.

08:09.630 --> 08:12.090
Okay.
You're not missing your prom.

08:12.100 --> 08:13.800
Cam...
I'm getting the feeling

08:13.800 --> 08:16.030
this is much more important
to you than it is to me.

08:16.040 --> 08:18.640
Well, maybe because
I didn't get to go to mine.

08:18.640 --> 08:20.100
Oh. I'm sorry.

08:20.110 --> 08:21.680
Yeah, it's a painful story.
(chuckles)

08:21.680 --> 08:23.620
I get it. Some things
are better left unsaid.

08:23.620 --> 08:25.110
Her name was Tina Day.

08:25.110 --> 08:27.510
We were just friends,
but I was so into asking her,

08:27.520 --> 08:30.320
I rented a white stallion
and a suit of armor.

08:30.320 --> 08:32.659
I wanted it to be a whole
"knight and Day" theme.

08:32.659 --> 08:34.059
(chuckles)
Hm.

08:34.059 --> 08:36.230
I was promposing
before it was even a thing.

08:36.230 --> 08:37.890
I rode up her driveway,

08:37.890 --> 08:40.059
and I could see
when she opened the door

08:40.059 --> 08:42.120
through the little slits
in my helmet

08:42.130 --> 08:43.360
what her answer was gonna be.

08:43.370 --> 08:45.170
She wanted
a traditional prom night

08:45.170 --> 08:48.400
with a guy
she could lose her virginity to.

08:48.400 --> 08:50.970
I couldn't blame her.

08:50.970 --> 08:52.970
I wanted the same thing.

08:52.980 --> 08:54.380
(chuckles)
(sighs)

08:54.380 --> 08:55.910
There's always Melanie Rylance,

08:55.910 --> 08:57.370
but you wouldn't want me
to ask someone...

08:57.380 --> 08:59.320
Delta, ready the dancers
and dove cannon.

09:00.650 --> 09:02.150
Poor lady.

09:02.150 --> 09:04.410
I feel terrible for screaming
at her like that.

09:04.420 --> 09:05.420
I blame myself.

09:05.420 --> 09:07.350
I blame yourself, too.

09:07.360 --> 09:08.660
I'm sorry.

09:08.660 --> 09:11.090
I'm just kind of
going through something.

09:11.090 --> 09:13.590
I got bumped from Lily's
career day this morning

09:13.600 --> 09:15.400
by a periodontist.

09:15.400 --> 09:18.230
That's right... My job is
less interesting that root rot.

09:18.230 --> 09:20.400
Who cares about a bunch
of third graders?

09:20.400 --> 09:23.060
You love
being a real-estate agent.

09:23.070 --> 09:25.270
First of all, I'm not
just a real-estate agent.

09:25.270 --> 09:27.000
I'm a Realtor.

09:27.010 --> 09:30.050
I'm a member of a national
association, a brotherhood,

09:30.050 --> 09:31.950
sworn to
the Realtor Code of Ethics!

09:31.950 --> 09:34.380
That's what this "R" stands for.

09:34.380 --> 09:36.440
Though, lately, it feels
like it stands for "regret."

09:36.450 --> 09:38.910
I know everything there is
to know about real estate,

09:38.920 --> 09:40.380
and nobody seems to care.

09:40.390 --> 09:41.790
Maybe I have the most boring
job in the world.

09:41.790 --> 09:43.120
No, Phil.

09:43.130 --> 09:46.430
Closets is the most boring job
in the world.

09:46.430 --> 09:47.800
(gasps)

09:47.800 --> 09:49.530
Ay, poor thing.

09:49.530 --> 09:51.590
She has to take the bus.

09:51.600 --> 09:52.890
Let's offer her a ride.

09:52.900 --> 09:54.030
Yes, yes.

09:54.040 --> 09:55.640
(car alarm chirps)

09:59.610 --> 10:00.810
A Maserati?

10:00.810 --> 10:02.910
She lied to us!

10:02.910 --> 10:04.940
(engine revs)

10:04.950 --> 10:07.450
iSeguila!
ISeguila!

10:07.450 --> 10:08.820
No,
that means "follow her."

10:08.820 --> 10:10.290
Oh.

10:14.490 --> 10:17.390
(cellphone rings)

10:17.390 --> 10:19.120
Hello?
ALEX: Hey, Mom.

10:19.130 --> 10:20.730
How do you turn on the
sprinklers for the front lawn?

10:20.730 --> 10:24.630
Uh, it's a little control box
by the front door.

10:24.630 --> 10:26.090
Why?
No reason.

10:26.100 --> 10:27.900
Look, now that I've got you
on the phone,

10:27.900 --> 10:30.770
I'm thinking it might be time to
upgrade our Internet security.

10:30.770 --> 10:32.100
Thoughts?

10:32.110 --> 10:33.480
Get rid of the Post-it note
on your laptop

10:33.480 --> 10:34.780
with your password on it.

10:34.780 --> 10:37.810
Why are you so worried
about security?

10:37.810 --> 10:39.770
It's my first ClosetCon
as C.E.O.,

10:39.780 --> 10:42.580
and I am dealing
with corporate espionage.

10:42.590 --> 10:44.090
Well, if you're so worried
about it,

10:44.090 --> 10:45.320
why don't you just call Grandpa?

10:45.320 --> 10:47.120
Do you know how that would look?

10:47.120 --> 10:48.620
I mean, it's bad enough
to go to the person

10:48.620 --> 10:50.190
who had your job before you,

10:50.190 --> 10:52.320
but when that person is Daddy...

10:52.330 --> 10:56.030
Honey, closet people
are ruthless.

10:56.030 --> 10:57.990
They'd eat me alive.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.670
Or maybe the world isn't filled
with heartless monsters.

11:00.670 --> 11:01.740
(knock on door)

11:03.470 --> 11:04.970
Hi.
My phone is wet.

11:04.970 --> 11:06.330
Can you call my mom?

11:07.680 --> 11:08.810
Hey, guys.
Sorry I'm late.

11:08.810 --> 11:10.270
I just got off the horn

11:10.280 --> 11:12.380
with Rick Friedman
over at Shelf Involved.

11:12.380 --> 11:14.110
That poor guy.

11:14.120 --> 11:18.150
Someone there has given away
corporate secrets. (scoffs)

11:18.150 --> 11:19.710
Makes me so glad

11:19.720 --> 11:22.650
that we just upgraded
our whole security system.

11:22.660 --> 11:25.730
I mean, we got hidden cameras
around this place

11:25.730 --> 11:28.030
that I don't even know about.
(chuckles)

11:29.730 --> 11:32.890
So, we got a cake
for Margaret's birthday.

11:32.900 --> 11:34.360
Mm-hmm.

11:34.370 --> 11:35.970
Fun.

11:35.970 --> 11:37.870
How you doing, Ben?
(gulps)

11:37.870 --> 11:39.170
(chuckles nervously)
Me?

11:39.180 --> 11:40.310
I'm good.
I am good.

11:40.310 --> 11:41.510
I am chill.

11:41.510 --> 11:43.210
I'm gonna go
to the bathroom, so...

11:45.050 --> 11:46.680
It's not really my birthday.

11:46.680 --> 11:48.840
I just wanted cake.

11:48.850 --> 11:51.410
I eat garbage
because I am garbage.

11:51.420 --> 11:54.160
(cellphone rings)

11:54.160 --> 11:55.830
Hey, Dad. Hi.

11:55.830 --> 11:57.530
Um, listen.
Can I call you back?

11:57.530 --> 11:59.060
JAY: Just wanted to confirm
we're on for dinner at...

11:59.060 --> 12:01.160
Oh, got another call.
One sec.

12:01.160 --> 12:03.590
Yeah, I think she's onto us.

12:03.600 --> 12:06.000
Yeah, a lot of mole talk.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.200
I think we just need
to calm things d...

12:08.200 --> 12:09.430
What?

12:09.440 --> 12:11.280
You're talking to her right now?

12:11.280 --> 12:13.500
Yeah, okay, bye.

12:13.510 --> 12:14.850
So, we're on for tonight?

12:14.850 --> 12:16.200
Sure.
Great.

12:16.210 --> 12:17.710
And, hey,
you sound a little tense.

12:17.710 --> 12:19.770
Don't let the job
make you crazy, huh?

12:19.780 --> 12:22.610
You go that route, soon you're
seeing plots everywhere.

12:22.620 --> 12:23.750
Great tip, Dad.

12:23.750 --> 12:24.950
Aah!

12:24.950 --> 12:26.080
You're spying for my dad!

12:26.090 --> 12:27.790
What? No!
Yes. I'm sorry.

12:27.790 --> 12:29.030
I don't know why I agreed.

12:29.030 --> 12:30.690
I just look up to your dad
so much.

12:30.690 --> 12:32.390
I can't believe
he doesn't trust me.

12:32.400 --> 12:34.030
Why did he put me
in charge, then?

12:34.030 --> 12:35.230
I don't know,
but I can find out.

12:35.230 --> 12:36.720
I'll double-agent.

12:36.730 --> 12:38.360
I've been working this game
since my parents' divorce.

12:38.370 --> 12:40.070
I was the only 10-year-old
in Great Neck

12:40.070 --> 12:41.800
with no bedtime
and Diners Club card.

12:41.800 --> 12:43.730
Fine. Don't make any plans
for tonight.

12:43.740 --> 12:45.280
You're coming to dinner
with me.
All right.

12:45.280 --> 12:47.540
Um, can we stop by my house
to change my shoes?

12:47.540 --> 12:49.740
I didn't make it up here
on the first try.

12:49.750 --> 12:51.050
(scoffs)

12:57.090 --> 12:58.790
All right,
the dove cannon's loaded,

12:58.790 --> 13:00.390
the dancers are stretching,
the dry ice is billowing.

13:00.390 --> 13:01.260
The moment you get her outside,
I will cue the team.

13:01.260 --> 13:02.430
Oh, there she is.

13:02.430 --> 13:04.090
Okay. Go.

13:04.090 --> 13:05.150
All right, team.
Look alive.

13:05.160 --> 13:06.450
We are hot.
We are hot.

13:06.460 --> 13:08.090
Hey, Melanie.
Listen...
Manny.

13:08.100 --> 13:09.300
Do you want to go
to prom with me?

13:09.300 --> 13:11.000
Uh, sure.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.470
(chuckles)

13:12.470 --> 13:14.400
Oh, hey.

13:14.400 --> 13:15.430
You got a second?

13:15.440 --> 13:16.740
Yeah.

13:16.740 --> 13:17.980
Yeah, I'm second.
You're first.

13:17.980 --> 13:19.500
I get it.
You win everything.

13:19.510 --> 13:21.180
That seems like something
I'm gonna hear about later.

13:21.180 --> 13:23.110
I need help
with Luke's promposal, okay?

13:23.110 --> 13:25.640
Can you go to the gym, wait for
Sarah, and then hand her this?

13:25.650 --> 13:27.750
Okay, this is
what I've been reduced to?
Yeah.

13:27.750 --> 13:30.590
Delivering an [sniffs]
unperfumed envelope
like a common bellhop?

13:30.590 --> 13:32.490
Fine.
Thank you. Okay.

13:32.490 --> 13:34.920
Stand down, everybody.

13:34.920 --> 13:37.250
Little Bear's gone rogue.

13:37.260 --> 13:39.930
Wait.

13:39.930 --> 13:41.460
Grayson! Hey.
(laughs)

13:41.460 --> 13:43.020
Hey, Coach.
Hey.

13:43.030 --> 13:45.860
Don't suppose you're planning
on asking anyone to prom.

13:45.870 --> 13:48.610
Um, I don't think we're allowed
to go with teachers.

13:48.610 --> 13:50.500
That's not what...

13:50.510 --> 13:53.480
So, this is the house
that stolen sauce built.
(doorbell rings)

13:53.480 --> 13:56.480
I'm so angry that
I don't even know what
I'm gonna say to her!

13:56.480 --> 13:58.280
Ah, so, this is the house

13:58.280 --> 13:59.820
that the stolen sauce built!

13:59.820 --> 14:03.150
Oh, I know what you're thinking,
but this isn't my house.

14:03.150 --> 14:05.650
I just come here
to get my paycheck.

14:05.650 --> 14:06.980
Grandma, my shower's broken.

14:06.990 --> 14:08.460
I'm gonna use the one
in the guesthouse.

14:08.460 --> 14:09.730
Whoa.

14:09.730 --> 14:11.200
Please be my new piano teacher.

14:12.290 --> 14:14.290
(sighs) Fine.

14:14.300 --> 14:15.700
I'm Auntie Alice.

14:15.700 --> 14:17.700
Auntie Thief and Auntie Liar.

14:17.700 --> 14:18.970
Yeah, yeah.

14:18.970 --> 14:21.300
I'm sure
we can work something out.

14:21.300 --> 14:22.960
Who's your patent lawyer?

14:22.970 --> 14:23.870
I don't have one.

14:23.870 --> 14:25.330
I know.

14:25.340 --> 14:28.040
I patented your sauce
this morning.

14:28.040 --> 14:31.710
Have a good trip home, kids.

14:31.710 --> 14:34.810
I am so sorry, Phil,
that I wasted your whole day,

14:34.820 --> 14:37.350
but I am more sorry of
what I'm gonna do to your car!

14:37.350 --> 14:39.080
Gloria, we're above that.

14:39.090 --> 14:40.560
But not everyone would be.

14:40.560 --> 14:42.560
You should put that beauty
in your garage.

14:42.560 --> 14:44.930
I don't have one.
Oh, really?

14:44.930 --> 14:47.400
Just out of curiosity,
do you not have a garage

14:47.400 --> 14:49.170
because you converted it
into the guesthouse

14:49.170 --> 14:51.000
where your grandson's
currently showering?

14:51.000 --> 14:52.400
What's your game, mister?

14:52.400 --> 14:54.100
I just find it interesting
that you have

14:54.100 --> 14:56.530
a fully plumbed stand-alone
dwelling on your property.

14:56.540 --> 14:58.170
That's none of your business.

14:58.170 --> 15:00.540
Even more peculiar, your
grandson appears to live here,

15:00.540 --> 15:04.070
but judging by his T-shirt,
he goes to Eden Mills High,

15:04.080 --> 15:06.580
an elite public school 12 miles
outside of your district.

15:06.580 --> 15:09.080
Oh, maybe with the money
you saved on private schools,

15:09.090 --> 15:11.520
you paid for the new two-sided
brick fireplace I saw,

15:11.520 --> 15:13.220
which hasn't been legal
since 1988.

15:13.220 --> 15:14.250
Go, Phil, go!

15:14.260 --> 15:16.060
Pull the sauce, Big Al,

15:16.060 --> 15:19.630
or Monday morning, the city's
here with a bulldozer,

15:19.630 --> 15:22.430
and your grandson goes to
a school with a metal detector.

15:22.430 --> 15:24.460
How do you know all this?

15:24.470 --> 15:27.110
What are you... some kind
of real-estate agent?

15:27.110 --> 15:29.460
No.
He's a Realtor.

15:29.470 --> 15:31.930
There is a difference somehow!

15:33.610 --> 15:35.280
(doors open)

15:35.280 --> 15:36.550
Oh, hey, kids.

15:36.550 --> 15:38.250
Actually, I'm waiting for Sarah,

15:38.250 --> 15:40.450
so if I could have the room
for just a... a minute.

15:40.450 --> 15:42.220
Thank...
Okay, funny.

15:42.220 --> 15:44.750
Whoever turned out the lights,
please turn them back on.

15:44.750 --> 15:46.880
They're not working.
Might be a fuse.

15:46.890 --> 15:47.930
(cellphone rings)

15:47.930 --> 15:49.080
Oh, um...

15:49.090 --> 15:50.420
Mitchell, we have a problem.

15:50.430 --> 15:52.230
MITCHELL:
No, we don't.

15:52.230 --> 15:56.100
I mean,
unless you're busy that night.

15:56.100 --> 15:58.430
Are... Are you
asking me to prom?

15:58.430 --> 16:01.060
Well, you know,
they need chaperones.

16:01.070 --> 16:03.010
Mitchell, this is the
sweetest thing you've
ever done for me.

16:03.010 --> 16:04.940
I-I don't know
if I've mentioned it,

16:04.940 --> 16:06.610
but I never got
to go to my own prom.

16:06.610 --> 16:08.580
It's come up.

16:08.580 --> 16:10.150
What about Luke's promposal?

16:10.150 --> 16:12.250
Well, your husband, who
couldn't plan anything romantic

16:12.250 --> 16:13.650
with a gun to his head,

16:13.650 --> 16:16.320
may have pulled off
two promposals at once.

16:16.320 --> 16:18.150
Mm-hmm.
Hey.

16:18.150 --> 16:20.480
Do you have any idea
who put that note in my locker

16:20.490 --> 16:21.930
asking me to be
a part of this thing?

16:21.930 --> 16:23.920
Oh, yeah, it was my uncle.

16:23.930 --> 16:26.800
It's pretty clever
how he turned out the lights.

16:26.800 --> 16:30.400
I said, "Turned out the lights"!

16:31.970 --> 16:34.440
Oh, my God!
Yes!

16:34.440 --> 16:37.310
Oh! That's so sweet.
I...

16:37.310 --> 16:39.310
And I can't believe
I'm finally going to prom.

16:39.310 --> 16:40.980
I can't believe
I finally have a happy memory

16:40.980 --> 16:42.710
in a high-school gym.
(laughs)

16:42.710 --> 16:44.340
CLAIRE: Joe did that to you?
JAY: Yeah.

16:44.350 --> 16:46.180
Slammed a car hood on it.
Why?

16:46.180 --> 16:47.540
I owed him money.

16:47.550 --> 16:49.650
It slipped while I was
teaching him to check oil.

16:49.650 --> 16:51.710
Well, that's pretty advanced
for a 3-year-old.

16:51.720 --> 16:53.360
What can I say?
I believe in my kids.

16:53.360 --> 16:55.890
Thank you. Mmm.
Mm.

16:55.890 --> 16:58.320
Looks good.
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

16:58.330 --> 17:00.800
Very nice.

17:00.800 --> 17:02.460
Let's quickly go over the plan.

17:02.460 --> 17:04.130
My dad's gonna be here
any minute.
Mm-hmm.

17:04.130 --> 17:05.630
We're doing this in stages.

17:05.630 --> 17:08.160
One finger means you text him

17:08.170 --> 17:09.670
"We're closing
the blinds division."

17:09.670 --> 17:11.230
Our biggest earner?

17:11.240 --> 17:12.980
He's gonna lose it if I tell
him we're shuttering blinds.

17:12.980 --> 17:16.650
Two fingers, we're partnering
with Rod Bushmill.

17:16.650 --> 17:19.050
That sleazebag represents
everything your father

17:19.050 --> 17:21.390
spent an entire career
fighting against.

17:21.390 --> 17:25.010
Three fingers,
we're not going to ClosetCon.
Wha...

17:25.020 --> 17:27.530
Are you trying to teach
your father a lesson
or crush his soul?

17:27.530 --> 17:29.650
Just business, kid.

17:29.660 --> 17:31.490
Monster.

17:31.490 --> 17:33.690
Looks good.
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

17:33.700 --> 17:35.900
(cellphone vibrates)
(sighs)

17:35.900 --> 17:38.770
So... with all this prom stuff
coming up,

17:38.770 --> 17:40.500
is your house
as topsy-turvy as ours is?

17:40.500 --> 17:42.160
Not really.
Manny's taking this girl.

17:42.170 --> 17:43.830
She's nothing special,
but solid.

17:43.840 --> 17:44.940
Mm.
Reliable.

17:44.940 --> 17:46.410
A lot like our blinds division.

17:46.410 --> 17:47.450
You know...
Not sexy, but...

17:47.450 --> 17:49.000
No, Dad.
No shop talk.

17:49.010 --> 17:51.170
You've had enough of that
for a lifetime.

17:54.350 --> 17:56.450
(cellphone vibrates)
Wow, your phone
is really blowing up tonight.

17:56.450 --> 17:57.710
Mm.

17:57.720 --> 17:58.790
Two old-fashioneds.

17:58.790 --> 17:59.860
Thank you.
Oh, thank you.

17:59.860 --> 18:01.390
Okay. Here.

18:01.390 --> 18:03.730
You know what else seems
old-fashioned to me nowadays?

18:03.730 --> 18:05.930
Mm?
Integrity.

18:05.930 --> 18:07.960
Maybe because I spent my career

18:07.960 --> 18:09.620
fighting the sleazeballs
in our industry.

18:09.630 --> 18:11.190
You know...
The Rod Bushmill types.

18:11.200 --> 18:12.370
Rod's a sweetheart.

18:12.370 --> 18:13.870
He bought me lunch last week.

18:13.870 --> 18:15.310
We got to talking
about whether or not we...

18:15.310 --> 18:17.530
(scoffs)
What am I doing?

18:17.540 --> 18:19.110
Jibber-jabbering
about work.
Mm.

18:19.110 --> 18:23.580
So, that little
grease monkey Joe is 3.

18:23.580 --> 18:25.880
Hard to believe.
3.

18:25.880 --> 18:30.580
They grow up so fast.
(cellphone vibrates)

18:30.590 --> 18:32.090
Got to be nice, though, Dad,

18:32.090 --> 18:34.160
knowing that your company
is in good hands

18:34.160 --> 18:35.930
and you can stay home
all day long and just
play with your kid.

18:35.930 --> 18:37.250
Have you lost your mind?

18:37.260 --> 18:38.890
Well, not <i> all</i> day, obviously.

18:38.890 --> 18:40.550
3-year-olds are nothing
but bipolar germ buckets.

18:40.560 --> 18:41.990
You're skipping out
on ClosetCon?

18:42.000 --> 18:43.470
Who told you that?
Ben.

18:43.470 --> 18:45.000
That little weasel
told me everything.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
Listen, I can tolerate
shutting down the blinds,

18:47.000 --> 18:49.800
even Rod Bushmill, but not
showing up for ClosetCon,

18:49.810 --> 18:51.410
you're asking
not to be taken seriously.

18:51.410 --> 18:53.140
My God, Claire!

18:53.140 --> 18:56.070
We're one strong season
away from being invited

18:56.080 --> 18:58.650
to Expo Internationale
du Closets!

18:58.650 --> 19:00.450
(sighs)

19:00.450 --> 19:01.690
Why are you looking at me
like that?

19:01.690 --> 19:03.580
'Cause I'm not doing
any of those things.

19:03.590 --> 19:06.520
I told that little weasel Ben
to text you those things

19:06.520 --> 19:09.420
when I found out
that he was spying for you.

19:09.430 --> 19:12.090
And, by the way,
it doesn't feel very nice

19:12.090 --> 19:14.290
to know that you don't think
that I can run your company.

19:14.300 --> 19:15.700
That's not why I did it.

19:15.700 --> 19:17.700
I thought maybe you could
use a little support.

19:17.700 --> 19:20.970
You're staring down the barrel
of your first ClosetCon.

19:20.970 --> 19:22.340
So you spied on me?

19:22.340 --> 19:23.770
I mean, you could have
given me a call.

19:23.770 --> 19:25.470
And tell you that you're
not doing your job?

19:25.470 --> 19:27.370
That would have
gone over fine with you.

19:31.010 --> 19:32.870
Need any help?

19:32.880 --> 19:33.910
No!
No.

19:35.350 --> 19:36.480
I mean, look at us.

19:36.490 --> 19:37.950
Why can't we both admit

19:37.950 --> 19:39.680
that we could use
each other's help right now?

19:39.690 --> 19:41.860
Are we too proud
to even do that?

19:41.860 --> 19:42.960
I'll admit it if you will.

19:42.960 --> 19:45.130
Fine. On 3.

19:45.130 --> 19:46.730
1...2... 3.

19:46.730 --> 19:48.500
Will you crack my lobster?
I want to come back to work.

19:48.500 --> 19:49.970
What?!
Damn it!

19:49.970 --> 19:51.300
Oh, my God.
You want to come back to work?

19:51.300 --> 19:52.970
I miss it, okay?

19:52.970 --> 19:54.870
You know how it is when you
have closets in your blood.

19:54.870 --> 19:57.110
I'm going crazy in retirement.

19:58.070 --> 19:59.300
Why are you smiling at me
like that?

19:59.310 --> 20:00.910
Because we're so similar.

20:00.910 --> 20:02.510
Do you know how many times
I've wanted to call you

20:02.510 --> 20:04.140
to ask for your help or advice,

20:04.150 --> 20:06.250
but I was afraid
I would look weak?

20:06.250 --> 20:07.880
(sighs)

20:07.880 --> 20:09.380
Here.
You crack this.

20:09.390 --> 20:11.990
Give me that.
I'll open these things.

20:11.990 --> 20:16.160
Well, Dad, what do you think
about coming back to work...

20:16.160 --> 20:18.230
I don't know...
One or two days a week?

20:18.230 --> 20:21.270
What I was thinking was,
I'd have a staff of five.
Mm-hmm.

20:21.270 --> 20:22.990
My own building.
What?

20:23.000 --> 20:24.830
And I report to no one.

20:24.830 --> 20:26.330
(chuckles)
I'm kidding.

20:26.340 --> 20:28.370
I'll put a desk
in the copy room.

20:28.370 --> 20:31.540
And, by the way, I've
known you for a long time.

20:31.540 --> 20:34.450
The last thing you need to
worry about is looking weak.

20:34.450 --> 20:37.540
♪♪

20:37.550 --> 20:39.850
MITCHELL: <i>It's not always easy
to ask for what you want,</i>

20:39.850 --> 20:41.720

<i>or a little help...</i>

20:45.790 --> 20:47.790
<i>or a little respect.</i>

20:47.790 --> 20:50.960
So, I admire you
for asking...
I don't.

20:50.960 --> 20:52.760
We both know why they're asking.

20:52.760 --> 20:55.890
No, you may not use our upstairs
apartment for an after party.

20:55.900 --> 20:57.030
- (groans)
- Oh.

20:57.030 --> 20:58.130
Lame.

20:58.600 --> 20:59.700
You look ravishing, my sweet.

20:59.700 --> 21:01.160
We said no talking.

21:07.110 --> 21:08.250
Come on. Come on.
I'm thirsty.

21:08.240 --> 21:09.470
I'll tell you
when you're thirsty.

21:09.480 --> 21:10.750
Come on.
Let me feel that power.

21:10.750 --> 21:12.110
Come on.
Make that leather sing!

21:12.110 --> 21:13.410
All right. Come on.
Get on your bike.

21:13.420 --> 21:14.790
Back up.
Get on your bike. Come on.

21:14.780 --> 21:15.910
They can't hit you
if they can't reach you.

21:15.920 --> 21:17.420
My pants are falling.

21:17.420 --> 21:18.720
Well, pull 'em up.

21:18.720 --> 21:19.890
Pull 'em up high
to your nipples.

21:19.890 --> 21:21.230
That prevents a low blow.

21:21.230 --> 21:22.450
What's a low blow?

21:22.460 --> 21:23.960
Fantastic.

21:23.960 --> 21:26.130
I have to emcee
a poetry retrospective tomorrow,

21:26.130 --> 21:27.930
and this shawl collar's
got more wrinkles

21:27.930 --> 21:29.730
than last night's
"Downton Abbey."

21:29.730 --> 21:31.230
<i>That</i> is.
