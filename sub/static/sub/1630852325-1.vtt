That's not dehydration.

19:32.404 --> 19:35.908
- I think Tanya and Arthur
were boyfriend and girlfriend.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.376
- Yeah.
If it's for Arthur,

19:37.476 --> 19:38.844
I'd believe
anything about Tanya.

19:38.911 --> 19:40.412
Do you think she loves him?

19:40.512 --> 19:42.047
Definitely not.

19:43.682 --> 19:44.249
This is it.

19:46.718 --> 19:48.420
Bye, Jeevan.

19:53.525 --> 19:55.360
- I'll wait until you get
in the door.

20:00.666 --> 20:01.900
<i>Hi, you've reached Laura.</i>

20:02.000 --> 20:03.869
<i>I can't answer</i>
<i>the phone right--</i>

20:16.381 --> 20:18.951
Don't you have a key?

20:19.051 --> 20:23.922
- Tanya has it.
- Fucking Tanya.

20:24.022 --> 20:25.857
Okay,
what about your neighbors?

20:27.693 --> 20:29.194
My dad hates the neighbors.

20:29.261 --> 20:31.463
What about those neighbors?

20:31.563 --> 20:33.532
- They're really old.
- Okay.

20:33.599 --> 20:35.300
Kirsten, please tell me
one person in the world

20:35.400 --> 20:38.804
who cares about you and I
will take you to them, please.

20:38.904 --> 20:40.105
Arthur.

20:43.742 --> 20:45.210
I'm really cold.

20:48.880 --> 20:49.815
Come on.

20:49.915 --> 20:52.484
Come run an errand with me.

20:54.086 --> 20:56.321
I can't leave you here.
Come on. Let's go.

21:00.492 --> 21:01.260
All right, come on.

21:11.837 --> 21:15.173
- Miranda, is that you?
Miranda Carroll.

21:15.274 --> 21:16.074
<i>Clark?</i>

21:16.141 --> 21:19.611
<i>How--how are you</i>
<i>calling this phone?</i>

21:19.678 --> 21:22.247
- I wanted to tell you
this directly.

21:22.314 --> 21:26.652
Um, Arthur has died.

21:26.752 --> 21:30.255
I--I'm so sorry.
He--he--he--um,

21:30.322 --> 21:35.427
he had a heart attack
on stage tonight, doing "Lear."

21:37.996 --> 21:41.033
Um, I mean, I don't know

21:41.133 --> 21:43.835
how much you've been
in touch lately or--

21:46.371 --> 21:49.541
Miranda?

21:49.641 --> 21:52.010
What did you say?

21:52.110 --> 21:54.546
Miranda?

21:55.814 --> 21:58.817
<i>- In the U.S., the FAA has not</i>
<i>set any travel restrictions</i>

21:58.884 --> 22:00.519
<i>into or out of the country.</i>

22:02.721 --> 22:04.823
<i>...or ahead of it,</i>
<i>no one's certain.</i>

22:04.890 --> 22:08.560
<i>But the holiday travel season</i>
<i>is likely to remain--</i>

22:08.660 --> 22:10.529
- Looks like your flight's
safe.

22:13.131 --> 22:15.067
- Yeah.
You should sleep another hour.

22:15.167 --> 22:17.369
We don't have
to leave until 7:00.

22:19.638 --> 22:23.175
I'm not coming.

22:23.241 --> 22:25.911
It's your friend's funeral.

22:26.011 --> 22:28.413
I just can't take
two weeks off.

22:29.881 --> 22:32.250
No, you're right.

22:39.591 --> 22:40.359
It's my burden.

22:40.425 --> 22:44.596
I can't share my weight
every time.

22:49.868 --> 22:51.703
I accept this.

23:14.359 --> 23:16.395
No fucking thank you.

23:16.461 --> 23:18.597
<i>This thing is a lot bigger</i>

23:18.697 --> 23:20.132
<i>than the major governments</i>
<i>expected.</i>

23:20.232 --> 23:23.268
<i>This is not</i>
<i>the boy cries wolf.</i>

23:23.368 --> 23:24.936
<i>This is the wolf.</i>

23:33.945 --> 23:35.647
Do you have money?

23:35.747 --> 23:36.648
Of course.

23:36.748 --> 23:41.119
- You don't have a job.
- Okay, but I have money.

23:41.219 --> 23:43.288
- What's it like
having a brother?

23:45.590 --> 23:47.826
It's annoying.

23:47.926 --> 23:50.061
Why?

23:50.128 --> 23:52.497
- Because brothers and sisters
know you too well.

23:55.100 --> 23:57.302
- Was that your sister
on the phone?

23:57.803 --> 24:01.840
Yeah.

24:01.940 --> 24:03.575
What did she say?

24:09.314 --> 24:12.417
Jeevan, what did she say?

24:13.985 --> 24:17.989
- Do you like Yoo-Hoo?

24:18.089 --> 24:19.825
- She talked for way
longer than that.

24:19.925 --> 24:22.627
No, I mean the drink.

24:22.694 --> 24:25.530
Come on.
Come on, it's the best.

24:27.365 --> 24:28.300
Is that chocolate milk?

24:28.366 --> 24:31.269
'Cause I'm not allowed
to have sugar.

24:31.336 --> 24:33.972
Even on a sleepover,
I can't break the rule.

24:44.316 --> 24:48.053
- Jeevan.

24:48.153 --> 24:48.620
Jeevan.

24:49.821 --> 24:52.157
Jeevan.

24:55.727 --> 24:57.796
- What?

25:04.169 --> 25:07.372
- Now is usually when I--

25:07.472 --> 25:13.078
when I would have
a panic attack, but I--

25:13.178 --> 25:15.413
I did that already back there.

25:21.520 --> 25:22.721
It's kind of like
I planned it.

25:27.025 --> 25:30.161
Okay. Come on. Let's go.

25:30.228 --> 25:31.730
We need way
more stuff than this.

26:09.601 --> 26:11.536
Uh, we don't take check.

26:11.603 --> 26:13.805
- Yeah, I mean, are people
really

26:13.905 --> 26:15.707
paying for their groceries
with checks still?

26:17.375 --> 26:19.544
When they're fake. yeah.

26:23.081 --> 26:24.716
Yeah. Okay.

26:33.425 --> 26:36.561
Never any doubt.

26:45.670 --> 26:47.172
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

26:47.272 --> 26:51.776
Uh, hey, excuse me?

26:51.843 --> 26:54.279
Is this because of that thing?

26:55.847 --> 26:56.681
Uh, the flu?

26:59.451 --> 27:03.355
Uh, should I go somewhere?

27:14.299 --> 27:15.767
You should go home.

27:22.140 --> 27:23.642
- Is everyone still
feeling okay?

27:26.344 --> 27:29.280
Yeah? Any coughing?
Any sore throats?

27:29.347 --> 27:32.717
Anyone feeling hot?
No?

27:32.817 --> 27:34.786
Okay, that's great.
That's great.

27:34.853 --> 27:36.388
Now listen, all of your parents
are getting really,

27:36.488 --> 27:38.857
really good treatment
right now.

27:38.957 --> 27:41.226
Okay? You guys stay warm.

27:41.326 --> 27:42.560
I'll see you.

27:52.971 --> 27:55.040
Fuck.

27:59.177 --> 28:01.746
- Tell them to keep their masks
on as much as they can.

28:01.846 --> 28:03.048
Who did you call?

28:03.148 --> 28:06.084
- My ex-husband. You?

28:06.184 --> 28:09.154
- One of my brothers won
a Pulitzer when he was 23.

28:09.220 --> 28:10.689
I picked the one
who owes me 18 grand

28:10.755 --> 28:12.157
and eats cereal for dinner.

28:12.223 --> 28:13.758
- Which one is that? Frank?
- Jeevan.

28:13.858 --> 28:14.826
Mm.

28:17.062 --> 28:19.664
- Hey. Anyone heard
anything else from the CDC?

28:19.731 --> 28:21.866
Our doors are not closing,
people!

28:22.867 --> 28:24.102
- They said the tamivir
shipment was sent

28:24.202 --> 28:25.670
to the east tower.

28:25.737 --> 28:28.106
Something about
a new shipping process.

28:28.206 --> 28:30.075
What?

28:30.175 --> 28:31.910
Hey, Terrence.
Who did you call?

28:32.010 --> 28:35.013
Oh, I just tweeted, "Bye."

28:35.080 --> 28:37.082
Dodson thought
tamivir would work.

28:37.182 --> 28:39.918
- At least he died hopeful.
- Would you want to know

28:40.018 --> 28:42.954
if tamivir
doesn't work if you were dying?

28:43.054 --> 28:43.688
You want that hope.

28:43.755 --> 28:48.626
- Can someone help me?
Anyone?

28:48.727 --> 28:51.362
Hey. I'm--I'm sorry
to bother you guys.

28:51.429 --> 28:53.398
Where do I take her?

28:53.465 --> 28:56.301
- Come with me.
I'll be right back.

29:17.589 --> 29:19.390
<i>- Why did you say that</i>
<i>to that man?</i>

29:23.995 --> 29:26.131
Jeevan?

29:27.799 --> 29:30.268
Why did you
tell him to go home?

29:33.805 --> 29:35.573
When are you gonna
take me home?

29:35.640 --> 29:37.342
My parents don't know
where I am.

29:37.442 --> 29:40.779
- Look, Kirsten, I know--

29:40.845 --> 29:44.349
I know this is
all a little scary, okay?

29:45.683 --> 29:47.919
But they're saying
that there's a--

29:47.986 --> 29:49.687
a health scare coming, okay,

29:49.788 --> 29:52.257
and people are supposed
to get inside.

29:52.323 --> 29:56.427
And the problem is we--

29:56.494 --> 30:00.431
we can't reach anyone
who knows you even exist.

30:00.498 --> 30:02.033
That's not fair!

30:05.970 --> 30:07.872
- If you want to go back
to your house,

30:07.972 --> 30:10.542
you want to try and get in,
we'll call a cab.

30:10.642 --> 30:12.377
We'll figure it out.

30:15.814 --> 30:18.883
Or you--you can spend the night
at my brother's apartment.

30:18.983 --> 30:21.820
I'm not allowed
to say you have to

30:21.886 --> 30:24.889
'cause that's kidnapping,
I think.

30:27.225 --> 30:29.360
And people should choose
for themselves what they want.

30:31.496 --> 30:33.898
- I'm eight.
- I know, but--

30:47.478 --> 30:48.847
You have to choose.

31:02.227 --> 31:05.330
Okay.

31:05.396 --> 31:07.765
I'll go home.

31:13.838 --> 31:15.039
Okay.

31:21.746 --> 31:24.949
- You got enough money
for a cab?

31:25.049 --> 31:28.286
- Yeah.
It was nice to meet you.

31:28.386 --> 31:30.221
Yeah.

31:43.401 --> 31:45.270
Hey, Kirsten.

31:51.743 --> 31:52.076
Uh, yeah, it's really weird.

31:52.143 --> 31:55.113
Your--

31:55.213 --> 31:56.114
your parents
just messaged me.

31:56.214 --> 31:58.917
I messaged them earlier.
I think they just got it.

32:02.086 --> 32:06.391
Uh, yeah. Turns out their car
got stuck in Lake Forest.

32:08.259 --> 32:11.462
So--

32:11.562 --> 32:14.165
so, yeah, they want you
to come with me

32:14.265 --> 32:16.501
and--and stay the night
at Frank's.

32:19.003 --> 32:21.639
It turns out they know
Frank from--from work things,

32:21.739 --> 32:25.843
so they're cool with it.

32:31.449 --> 32:33.351
Also, I was wrong.

32:33.451 --> 32:36.120
The world's not ending.

32:38.022 --> 32:41.492
So that's cool.

32:44.195 --> 32:47.265
- Okay.
- Okay.

32:50.969 --> 32:52.370
Okay.

32:56.975 --> 32:58.876
You're gonna steer, okay?
I'll push.

32:58.977 --> 33:00.611
- Okay.
- You got it?

33:00.678 --> 33:02.213
- Yeah.
- Okay.

33:03.715 --> 33:06.718
Frank's gonna be excited.

33:36.180 --> 33:38.249
<i>- Hello, you've reached</i>
<i>Frank Chaudhary.</i>

33:38.349 --> 33:40.518
<i>Please leave a message</i>
<i>and I'll get back to you.</i>

33:54.032 --> 33:55.033
Jeevan.

34:05.276 --> 34:07.278
- Just wait here, okay?
- Okay.

34:28.199 --> 34:29.867
Hello?

34:48.753 --> 34:50.988
No. Don't open the door.

34:53.958 --> 34:56.894
I'll call an ambulance for you.

34:56.961 --> 34:58.629
I'll have an ambulance come.

34:59.931 --> 35:03.067
- Don't open it, man.

35:03.134 --> 35:08.506
- I've got a kid with me.
- I have to get to the--

35:13.344 --> 35:14.278
Okay, come on. Let's go.

35:14.345 --> 35:16.914
- What was wrong with him?
- Don't look at him.

35:16.981 --> 35:18.182
Let's just go.

35:25.590 --> 35:27.425
We're going for that door.

35:28.960 --> 35:30.862
Just watch out for the ice.

35:38.436 --> 35:39.103
All right. It's to the left.

35:41.172 --> 35:41.539
All right.
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

35:41.639 --> 35:44.142
Okay, okay.

35:48.346 --> 35:54.819
Hi. Uh, I'm the brother
of Frank Chaudhary

35:54.886 --> 35:57.522
who lives on the 42nd floor,
I think.

35:57.622 --> 36:02.493
And this is his niece.

36:02.560 --> 36:05.229
Our niece. Both our niece.
Kirsten.

36:07.331 --> 36:08.733
- I gotta call up.
- Yeah, that's fine.

36:08.833 --> 36:10.501
I mean, he knows we're coming.

36:10.568 --> 36:13.838
And we got some things for--
for his Christmas party.

36:13.905 --> 36:16.207
- Good evening, Mr. Chaudhary.
I've got a Jeevan down here.

36:16.307 --> 36:18.643
Says he's your brother.
He's with your niece.

36:18.709 --> 36:20.545
Want to come up.
They've got some items

36:20.645 --> 36:21.646
- for your Christmas party.
- Hey, Frank.

36:21.712 --> 36:23.748
Hi, Uncle Frank.

36:33.357 --> 36:35.826
- Freight elevator's that way.
- All right, thank you.

36:46.404 --> 36:50.174
- Hold that, please!

36:50.241 --> 36:52.677
Oh! Oh.
I'm so sorry.

36:52.743 --> 36:55.246
This thing is huge.

36:55.346 --> 36:56.614
Can I squeeze in with you guys?

36:56.714 --> 36:58.049
It's really full.

36:58.115 --> 37:00.518
Uh, I think if I just
kinda angle it,

37:00.585 --> 37:02.787
- I can squeeze the thing--
- It's fuckin' full!

37:13.264 --> 37:16.701
It was really full.

37:16.767 --> 37:17.802
- Frank, open the door, Frank.

37:17.902 --> 37:19.804
- Hold on!
- Come on!

37:19.904 --> 37:24.141
- Hold on!
- Open it!

37:24.242 --> 37:26.644
Jeev.

37:26.744 --> 37:27.979
Little white girl.

37:28.079 --> 37:31.582
- Okay, it's all coming in.
Back up.

37:31.649 --> 37:33.618
Frank, this is Kirsten.
Kirsten, Frank.

37:33.718 --> 37:35.253
- Hi.
- Hi.

37:35.319 --> 37:36.387
Do you know what's happening?

37:36.454 --> 37:37.622
No, what's happening?

37:37.722 --> 37:38.489
Have you spoken to Siya?

37:38.589 --> 37:40.324
- No, I've been working.
What are you do--

37:40.424 --> 37:42.393
- No. I don't need all this.
- Back up!

37:42.460 --> 37:43.995
- I need to get it in.
- I don't need it!

37:44.095 --> 37:45.062
- I got groceries.
- The world's ending, Frank!

37:45.129 --> 37:46.330
Okay? It's actually ending.

37:46.430 --> 37:47.832
Sorry. I--I lied.

37:47.932 --> 37:49.267
It's--it's ending.

37:50.768 --> 37:52.103
I spoke to Siya
at the hospital.

37:52.169 --> 37:53.504
- How--how do you
know my brother?

37:53.604 --> 37:54.572
- Now she's not answering
her phone.

37:54.639 --> 37:55.239
We met at the play.

37:57.308 --> 37:58.776
She told me that this thing,

37:58.843 --> 38:01.178
this flu, it's--
it's--it's mutated.

38:01.279 --> 38:02.513
- I appreciate you
bringing me stuff.

38:02.613 --> 38:03.481
- And that this--
- This is not

38:03.581 --> 38:05.283
a storage facility.
You know my neighbors--

38:05.349 --> 38:07.451
No one knows anything, Frank.

38:07.518 --> 38:08.853
- Just sit down.
Just calm down.

38:08.953 --> 38:11.188
Just--just breathe. Breathe.

38:14.091 --> 38:17.028
- Yeah, I think--
it's the flu!

38:17.128 --> 38:19.530
- The flu?
The flu made you buy groceries?

38:35.179 --> 38:38.282
- I did see.
- But then turn on the TV

38:38.349 --> 38:41.052
for one minute, and--and maybe
you'll see that--

38:43.654 --> 38:46.123
What is that?

38:46.190 --> 38:48.693
I think it's that.

39:19.657 --> 39:21.325
We have to go get Siya.

39:25.363 --> 39:28.165
She told me to come get you.

39:32.002 --> 39:34.338
And to build a barricade.

39:49.387 --> 39:50.121
<i>Hey.</i>

39:50.221 --> 39:53.758
<i>I'm glad you guys</i>
<i>are together.</i>

39:53.858 --> 39:55.359
<i>It's quiet here now.</i>

39:55.426 --> 39:58.129
<i>I love you.</i>

40:09.073 --> 40:10.908
<i>I love you. Miss you. Bye.</i>

42:15.900 --> 42:17.601
Let's get to the lake.

42:59.777 --> 43:04.315
<i>Hello, I'm Jeevan Chaudhary.</i>

43:04.415 --> 43:05.382
<i>And you're Kirsten--</i>

43:05.449 --> 43:07.051
<i>- Raymonde.</i>
<i>- Raymonde--</i>

43:29.340 --> 43:30.841
Kirsten!

43:32.443 --> 43:33.844
We're rehearsing again.

43:33.944 --> 43:36.847
- Okay.
I'll be there in a minute.

43:36.947 --> 43:39.650
- See you over there.
- Okay.
