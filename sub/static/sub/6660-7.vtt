00:04.784 --> 00:06.877
So vice president Meyer
is under pressure today, Rod.

00:06.878 --> 00:08.378
<i>That's right, Vic.
She fired one of her</i>

00:08.379 --> 00:10.380
<i>secret service men
because he smiled.</i>

00:10.381 --> 00:12.751
<i>He wasn't fired, he was reassigned.</i>

00:12.752 --> 00:15.020
<i>This doesn't look good for the VP's
chief of staff Amy Brookheimer.</i>

00:15.021 --> 00:18.391
Amy, you listening
to Crock FM right now?

00:18.392 --> 00:20.328
Yeah, that's exactly
what I'm doing.

00:20.329 --> 00:23.898
Well, don't sweat it.
I can still bust some moves in this town.

00:23.899 --> 00:25.366
Bust some moves?
Really, Mike?

00:25.367 --> 00:27.935
I have a black belt
in Mike Kwan Do.

00:27.936 --> 00:30.004
All right, sir, no.

00:30.005 --> 00:32.272
Okay, okay.
Hey, hey, easy, dough boy.

00:32.273 --> 00:33.406
Hands off the suit.

00:33.407 --> 00:36.375
<i>Uh-oh, blame me
Brookheimer.</i>

00:36.376 --> 00:38.577
<i>Stop laughing there, Vic. That's treason.</i>

00:38.578 --> 00:40.745
- Hello?
- Dan.

00:40.746 --> 00:44.014
You must have a huge schadenboner
over this Amy flack.

00:44.015 --> 00:47.182
Oh, I take no pleasure in my
colleague's very public, brutal...

00:47.183 --> 00:49.384
I'm trying to watch TV.
Would you please move?

00:49.385 --> 00:51.721
And probably career-ending
humiliation, Jonah.

00:51.722 --> 00:55.292
God, she is gonna go
ape-shit menstrual over this.

00:55.293 --> 00:57.829
Hey, I'm on the phone with AT&T.
Can you stop shouting "menstrual"?

00:57.830 --> 01:00.331
<i>Yeah, you know, she'll probably
go a little menstrual.</i>

01:00.332 --> 01:03.668
Yeah, she probably will.
Although, when you think about it,

01:03.669 --> 01:06.104
- it's actually kind of worse for you.
- Is that right?

01:06.105 --> 01:09.074
Well, the VP'S office
is a cataclysm on spin cycle.

01:09.075 --> 01:11.443
And then you got that
pregnancy rumor flying around

01:11.444 --> 01:13.746
like the contents
of a broken fucking condom.

01:13.747 --> 01:17.249
It's gonna be last in and first out and
you're a dead Dan walk... what the fuck?

01:17.250 --> 01:19.418
This is going in with the dirty dishes,
man.

01:19.419 --> 01:24.289
For fuck's sake. If this is broken,
I'm adding it to your fucking rent.

01:24.290 --> 01:27.691
<i>Please call in on this one.
Should Amy Brookheimer go?</i>

01:29.000 --> 01:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:40.039 --> 01:42.808
But the bottom line is,
you keep the streets safe,

01:42.809 --> 01:44.443
I'll keep your budget safe.

01:44.444 --> 01:47.246
Well, I was gonna say that
brings a smile to my face,

01:47.247 --> 01:49.081
but that would be safe,
wouldn't it, ma'am?

01:49.082 --> 01:51.551
That's very funny, Bill.
You're fired.

01:51.552 --> 01:54.320
I'm kidding. I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

01:54.321 --> 01:56.456
Hey, ma'am, it's leave o'clock.

01:56.457 --> 01:58.558
Okay, yes. I'm afraid
I have to go, gentlemen.

01:58.559 --> 02:00.660
Thank you so much.

02:00.661 --> 02:02.828
Let's be cheerful out there.

02:02.829 --> 02:05.731
<i>Mike, this is not a story.</i>

02:05.732 --> 02:08.333
<i>Collins made a bunch of faces,
he was reassigned.</i>

02:08.334 --> 02:11.035
That shouldn't be news.
How in the hell did this happen?

02:11.036 --> 02:13.238
It's the secret service,
for Christ's sake.

02:13.239 --> 02:15.240
"Secret" as in shut the fuck up.

02:15.241 --> 02:17.643
And "service" as in
you work for me, okay?

02:17.644 --> 02:18.977
So why don't you
shut the fuck up?

02:18.978 --> 02:21.012
We have an enemy
and I want a name

02:21.013 --> 02:22.948
and a severed head
that answers to that name,

02:22.949 --> 02:25.150
or would if it
could still talk.

02:25.151 --> 02:27.519
All right, I'm gonna
be in my office.

02:27.520 --> 02:29.521
Alone!

02:29.522 --> 02:32.157
Ooh, Gary, did the veep

02:32.158 --> 02:34.159
just bitch-slap you
with a door?

02:34.160 --> 02:36.261
She didn't mean that.
She's got a lot on her mind today.

02:36.262 --> 02:38.163
Oh, yeah, you mean
like firing Amy?

02:38.164 --> 02:41.366
Or someone who's undermining the
president by back-channeling Macauley.

02:41.367 --> 02:44.635
- That's bullshit.
- Okay, I need to tell you guys something.

02:44.636 --> 02:46.137
Oh, what, is she out
of hand sanitizer again?

02:46.138 --> 02:48.339
I can't say this.
I can't tell you this.

02:48.340 --> 02:49.806
Gary, why are you talking
in cliffhangers?

02:49.807 --> 02:53.410
Selina's had a miscarriage.

02:53.411 --> 02:56.581
Well, this is good for us.

02:56.582 --> 02:59.117
- Nicely done, Dandroid.
- How is she?

02:59.118 --> 03:01.719
Free from a major fucking
political headache, I'd say.

03:01.720 --> 03:03.487
That's deep space cold, Dan.

03:03.488 --> 03:05.289
Explains why you piss
liquid nitrogen.

03:05.290 --> 03:07.257
Okay, Ted.
I'll call you back, then.

03:07.258 --> 03:09.226
So that's...

03:09.227 --> 03:11.095
What?
What's going on?

03:11.096 --> 03:15.934
Uh, I was telling the guys
about my riding mower I got.

03:15.935 --> 03:18.070
Wow, Gary.

03:18.071 --> 03:21.473
That was quick.
Look at that.

03:21.474 --> 03:23.942
Okay, everybody.
Please come into my office.

03:23.943 --> 03:27.379
White House is in the house.
* Everybody say way-o! *

03:27.380 --> 03:29.649
The skyscraper of shit
has arrived.

03:29.650 --> 03:31.784
Madam Vice President,
top story today

03:31.785 --> 03:33.886
is that viral sensation
that's sweeping the nation.

03:33.887 --> 03:35.555
What are you talking about?

03:35.556 --> 03:37.256
- May I?
- No, you may not.

03:37.257 --> 03:39.692
Okay.

03:41.562 --> 03:44.897
It's tagged
"Selina Sell-Outta."

03:44.898 --> 03:48.368
<i>Selina Meyer, has this
veep lost control?</i>

03:48.369 --> 03:50.904
<i>- Are, are, are.
- She says she's an environmentalist,</i>

03:50.905 --> 03:52.706
<i>but she vetoes
environmental protection.</i>

03:52.707 --> 03:55.408
<i>She sets up a clean jobs
task force</i>

03:55.409 --> 03:58.044
<i>that includes not one,
but two oil men.</i>

03:58.045 --> 03:59.378
I'm gonna tell you the truth.

03:59.379 --> 04:01.213
<i>What is the mental
state of a veep</i>

04:01.214 --> 04:02.914
<i>that fires a man for smiling?</i>

04:05.284 --> 04:07.151
- I love this part.
- Could you...

04:07.152 --> 04:09.153
I am Selina Meyer.

04:09.154 --> 04:13.925
And I don't have any idea
what's going on in my office.

04:13.926 --> 04:16.961
All right, pack up your limbs
and get the fuck out, Jonah.

04:16.962 --> 04:19.196
- Get him out.
- Hey, don't shoot the messenger.

04:19.197 --> 04:21.430
- Is punching allowed?
- Oh, you wouldn't stand a chance.

04:21.432 --> 04:23.100
I have a much longer reach.

04:23.101 --> 04:26.637
- Did everybody get a chance to see this?
- No!

04:26.638 --> 04:28.873
I mean, how are we gonna
shut this negativity down?

04:28.874 --> 04:31.576
<i>- Amy, what are we gonna do?
- Yeah, well, it's inaccurate.</i>

04:31.577 --> 04:34.513
Technically, the secret
service guy was reassigned.

04:34.514 --> 04:37.416
Yeah, and technically
we didn't put two oil guys

04:37.417 --> 04:39.919
- on clean jobs task force.
- Oh, yeah, I see.

04:39.920 --> 04:42.655
And technically this is
a fully functioning office, too.

04:42.656 --> 04:45.125
Well, that secret service
clown has obviously leaked us.

04:45.126 --> 04:46.660
That's right, Mike.
Good. You know what?

04:46.661 --> 04:48.696
You're gonna have to go
talk to him, okay?

04:48.697 --> 04:51.331
You are the closest to normal we've
got going in this office right now.

04:51.332 --> 04:52.999
Thanks, I think.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.667
<i>Okay, there's a White House
request to publish</i>

04:54.668 --> 04:56.535
all the secret service
office personnel records.

04:56.536 --> 04:58.971
Are you kidding me?
They want our records now?

04:58.972 --> 05:01.106
What are we gonna do?
What?

05:01.107 --> 05:03.942
Well, we have to release those.
And that has got me thinking

05:03.943 --> 05:06.678
why not release
all of our fucking records?

05:06.679 --> 05:08.946
- Full disclosure.
- Are you serious?

05:08.947 --> 05:10.381
Yeah, publish everything.

05:10.382 --> 05:12.783
All of our emails,
all of our phone records.

05:12.784 --> 05:14.585
Right, right, 'cause they won't
have time to read everything.

05:14.586 --> 05:15.954
I mean, you can't
read everything.

05:15.955 --> 05:17.088
I don't read half the stuff
I'm supposed to.

05:17.089 --> 05:19.891
So by showing that
we have nothing to hide,

05:19.892 --> 05:22.027
then we can actually
hide some stuff.

05:22.028 --> 05:23.762
Dan, what do you
think about this?

05:23.763 --> 05:26.465
I just think that this could
blow up in all of our faces.

05:26.466 --> 05:28.367
Just because this isn't
your baby, you don't...

05:28.368 --> 05:31.704
- God, I am so sorry.
- Oh, it's fine. It's fine.

05:31.705 --> 05:33.839
I mean, it was like a heavy period.
Don't worry about it.

05:33.840 --> 05:35.607
<i>All right, you know what,
guys? We're doing this.</i>

05:35.608 --> 05:37.776
I've made the decision
that we are going to

05:37.777 --> 05:40.311
release all of our
correspondence.

05:40.312 --> 05:42.947
Full disclosure
is now the name of the game.

05:42.948 --> 05:45.182
Mike will fill you in
on the rest of it.

05:45.183 --> 05:46.950
- Right, Mike?
- Yes, ma'am.

05:46.951 --> 05:49.953
Okay.
Thank you.

05:49.954 --> 05:54.258
All right, obviously it is not
gonna be full disclosure.

05:54.259 --> 05:57.862
Okay? It's gonna be partial
disclosure light.

05:57.863 --> 06:00.498
We don't want to have
a paper trail

06:00.499 --> 06:01.800
on clean jobs.

06:01.801 --> 06:04.703
There can be no...
Are you writing that down?

06:04.704 --> 06:07.606
Why would you be
writing that down?

06:07.607 --> 06:11.944
Nothing about Sidney Purcell having
access to clean jobs, all right?

06:11.945 --> 06:13.912
We have to check
Sue's calendar, make sure

06:13.913 --> 06:17.716
there are no meetings there
that I did-didn't have.

06:17.717 --> 06:19.884
The accidentally racist
brochure that we had to shred.

06:19.885 --> 06:21.653
Oh, we're gonna redact
that for sure.

06:21.654 --> 06:24.289
But the thing is,
is that I still think

06:24.290 --> 06:26.024
there needs to be something
embarrassing in there.

06:26.025 --> 06:27.325
- You know what I mean?
- Sure.

06:27.326 --> 06:28.726
So it doesn't look
as if we've just airbrushed

06:28.727 --> 06:29.994
the nipples out of
this fucking thing.

06:29.995 --> 06:32.129
No, that's really good.
And it makes... yeah.

06:32.130 --> 06:36.167
Massages at the residence.
The press will obsess about those.

06:36.168 --> 06:39.337
- Massages? What massages?
- Your back facials.

06:39.338 --> 06:41.673
- Oh.
- Back facials? What?

06:41.674 --> 06:43.809
Yeah, I get back acne.
Backne.

06:43.810 --> 06:46.112
Okay, okay.
I think we can live with that.

06:46.113 --> 06:47.680
Shall we release the logs
from the residence?

06:47.681 --> 06:50.183
Uh, yeah, sure.
We can do that.

06:50.184 --> 06:51.919
- Okay?
- Okay.

06:51.920 --> 06:54.020
Got a plan.
Oh, Dan.

06:54.021 --> 06:56.155
Can I talk to you
just for a quick sec?

06:56.156 --> 06:58.157
- Yeah.
- You want me to stay?

06:58.158 --> 06:59.591
Did I ask you to stay?

07:00.460 --> 07:02.995
Thank you.

07:04.864 --> 07:09.601
Um, Dan, listen, do I have anything
that I need to be worried about?

07:09.602 --> 07:11.936
Just a random example might be

07:11.937 --> 07:15.406
anything about the Macauley
amendment you need...

07:15.407 --> 07:17.241
- No. No, ma'am.
- No?

07:17.242 --> 07:20.812
Because if anyone
thought this office

07:20.813 --> 07:24.048
had anything to do
with that amendment,

07:24.049 --> 07:27.151
which went against the
president's wishes and policy,

07:27.152 --> 07:29.553
that would be completely wrong

07:29.554 --> 07:32.790
and it would be
curtains for everyone.

07:32.791 --> 07:34.091
Yes, ma'am.

07:34.092 --> 07:37.395
I mean, I don't know what
you did or didn't do,

07:37.396 --> 07:39.830
but I do know that I can't know

07:39.831 --> 07:41.565
what you know
or you don't know.

07:41.566 --> 07:44.102
- You know?
- I know.

07:44.103 --> 07:46.070
Okay, good.

07:47.173 --> 07:50.109
Oh, fuck.

07:50.110 --> 07:52.744
Uh, you okay, ma'am?

07:52.745 --> 07:55.113
Yeah, Ame, listen.

07:55.114 --> 07:57.917
I'm sorry I snapped
at you there.

07:57.918 --> 08:00.052
I thought you were
about to fire me.

08:03.524 --> 08:05.825
I'm sorry to hear

08:05.826 --> 08:09.296
that you lost... that you're
no longer pregnant.

08:09.297 --> 08:11.732
Oh, yeah, thanks.

08:12.834 --> 08:14.501
Um, here's the deal, though.

08:14.502 --> 08:16.670
On top of everything else,

08:16.671 --> 08:19.873
I think that Ted is
getting ready to dump me.

08:21.975 --> 08:23.943
What is that...

08:23.944 --> 08:26.312
nodding thing supposed to mean?

08:26.313 --> 08:28.313
No, no, my...

08:28.314 --> 08:29.681
processing information.

08:29.682 --> 08:32.116
The nod of my head
is like I'm buffering.

08:32.116 --> 08:35.854
Oh, well, once you're
done buffering,

08:35.855 --> 08:39.390
what is it that
you're thinking?

08:39.392 --> 08:42.394
I don't know.
Maybe the thrill is gone.

08:42.395 --> 08:43.695
What do you mean?

08:43.696 --> 08:46.699
Like the thrill of the whole
power thing wore off.

08:46.700 --> 08:50.002
And now he just doesn't
like what's un...

08:50.003 --> 08:51.270
Doesn't like what?

08:51.271 --> 08:53.272
He just doesn't...
doesn't really...

08:53.273 --> 08:57.511
Okay, I think you'd better
get out of my office.

09:00.248 --> 09:02.150
- See, I didn't mean that...
- It's okay.

09:02.151 --> 09:03.718
- It's fine.
- Okay.

09:03.719 --> 09:04.986
Just...

09:09.859 --> 09:12.261
<i>Let me see this.</i>

09:12.262 --> 09:14.896
Look, I can still
read the names, okay?

09:14.897 --> 09:17.166
You've got to put black
marker over all the words.

09:17.167 --> 09:19.334
Abby, you may have
to pull an all-nighter

09:19.335 --> 09:21.103
with the IDGN number redacting

09:21.104 --> 09:23.339
if you're behind on
the IDGN number redacting.

09:23.340 --> 09:25.774
Okay, folks, 12 hours.
Let's make it happen.

09:25.775 --> 09:27.843
We can do this.

09:32.916 --> 09:34.550
I'll get it.

09:36.119 --> 09:39.222
<i>Thank you all for coming
on such short notice.</i>

09:39.223 --> 09:40.823
I know, who'd have thought
transparent government

09:40.824 --> 09:42.492
would take up so much
of your field of vision?

09:42.493 --> 09:45.261
Have at it.

09:45.262 --> 09:47.597
- Get it while it's hot.
- You got that?

09:47.598 --> 09:50.066
You good?

09:54.471 --> 09:57.506
Cup of Joe for the guys.
Man, I need it.

09:57.507 --> 10:00.676
I could pass out right now.

10:00.677 --> 10:03.045
You said this was
a homeland security issue.

10:03.046 --> 10:06.615
It's exactly that. It's a very
homeland security angle... issue.

10:06.616 --> 10:08.284
It's imperative
to me being here.

10:08.285 --> 10:09.919
You ever been in
the line of fire, Mike?

10:09.920 --> 10:12.522
Yes, sir.
Went to Iraq with the veep.

10:12.523 --> 10:14.424
Presented a Thanksgiving
turkey.

10:14.425 --> 10:17.226
I was there.
No fire as I recall.

10:17.227 --> 10:19.595
No, but the line was there.

10:19.596 --> 10:21.297
Whew.
Do you mind?

10:21.298 --> 10:26.135
So how's the place been over
at Arlington Cemetery going?

10:26.136 --> 10:28.538
- I hear it's pretty nice there.
- It's nothing to smile about.

10:28.539 --> 10:31.240
I'm also looking after my uncle.
He has dementia.

10:31.241 --> 10:32.842
Does he ever say
anything funny?

10:32.843 --> 10:34.510
What do you want,
Mr. McLintock?

10:34.511 --> 10:37.413
Just want to make sure
you're doing okay, Martin.

10:37.414 --> 10:38.481
You think
I'm the whistle-blower.

10:38.482 --> 10:40.783
Whistle-blowing makes
it sound patriotic.

10:40.784 --> 10:42.618
I was fucking
transferred for nothing.

10:42.619 --> 10:46.355
No, you were transferred for
being jocular and overfamiliar.

10:46.356 --> 10:48.591
Security guys are supposed
to be like wallpaper.

10:48.592 --> 10:50.993
They're not supposed to be
grinning like some ape.

10:58.536 --> 11:00.838
Okay.

11:03.241 --> 11:05.376
The "Times" are saying
we're trying to hide stuff

11:05.377 --> 11:07.011
by causing a deluge.

11:07.012 --> 11:09.481
They're calling it
an e-nami.

11:09.482 --> 11:11.617
Is anybody picking
up on the back facials?

11:11.618 --> 11:14.019
The press was supposed to pick
on those damn back facials.

11:14.020 --> 11:16.954
- No.
- Hey, gimme a "J"!

11:18.190 --> 11:20.958
<i>Hi, everybody.</i>

11:22.160 --> 11:23.527
So no apologies?

11:23.528 --> 11:25.328
For what?

11:25.329 --> 11:27.330
Oh, for what? Oh.

11:27.331 --> 11:30.033
"Washington Post."
Page 17.

11:30.034 --> 11:32.969
<i>You've disclosed an email
containing birthday gift</i>

11:32.970 --> 11:35.871
suggestions for an unnamed
White House aide.

11:35.872 --> 11:37.673
<i>"Suggestion number one...</i>

11:37.674 --> 11:40.176
A cake in the shape
of a dick."

11:42.679 --> 11:45.548
<i>"Suggestion number two...
A smart new hat</i>

11:45.549 --> 11:49.084
- in the shape of a dick."
- Oh, that made it in there!

11:49.085 --> 11:51.653
<i>Everybody knows this is me, guys.</i>

11:51.654 --> 11:53.889
- Oh, everybody? Really?
- Yes, everybody.

11:53.890 --> 11:56.458
There are 3,000 people on
the White House payroll, Jonah.

11:56.459 --> 11:58.594
Who's the VP liaison, Amy?

11:58.595 --> 12:02.131
I'm going into coffee shops,
I'm going into meetings,

12:02.132 --> 12:04.133
and people are looking
at me and whispering.

12:04.134 --> 12:06.602
<i>And they are whispering "Dick Cake."</i>

12:06.603 --> 12:08.904
West Wing, Jonah.

12:08.905 --> 12:12.241
No, who is DC?

12:12.242 --> 12:13.876
Uh, Dick Cake.

12:13.877 --> 12:16.145
Oh, for fuck's sake.
Is this Ryan?

12:16.146 --> 12:18.748
- Oh, no, no, no!
- What?

12:18.749 --> 12:20.650
Every time Ted stayed
overnight at the residence

12:20.651 --> 12:23.988
- has been fully disclosed.
- Oh, Ted's gonna love that.

12:23.989 --> 12:27.625
Some of the bloggers are linking Ted's
overnighters to the pregnancy rumors.

12:27.626 --> 12:31.162
What?
Oh, come on.

12:31.163 --> 12:34.265
Mike, can't you make me
not have been pregnant?

12:34.266 --> 12:35.966
- God!
- You see?

12:35.967 --> 12:39.870
This is what happens when you tell
the truth. Nothing good comes of it.

12:39.871 --> 12:42.172
Okay, I'm gonna get you
a cup of rose hip tea.

12:42.173 --> 12:45.375
Keith at Reuters says secret
service story, it's out there.

12:45.376 --> 12:46.943
- Right now?
- Yeah.

12:46.944 --> 12:49.245
<i>It seems the veep's office
has compounded the problem</i>

12:49.246 --> 12:52.014
<i>by insulting the man
and calling him an ape.</i>

12:52.015 --> 12:54.416
<i>Who's responsible for this
deranged campaign?</i>

12:54.417 --> 12:56.252
<i>Mike McLintock, press officer?</i>

12:56.253 --> 12:59.021
<i>Chief of staff Amy Brookheimer,
or Selina Meyer herself?</i>

12:59.022 --> 13:01.657
<i>Of course, she bears
ultimate responsibility.</i>

13:07.130 --> 13:09.097
Potus will not like this.

13:09.098 --> 13:11.700
This is gonna cause
a total potal meltdown.

13:11.701 --> 13:13.768
All right, get him
out of here, Dan.

13:13.769 --> 13:16.270
Yeah, why don't you run along and
see if you can suck your own cake?

13:16.271 --> 13:18.506
Oh, that's clever, Dan.

13:18.507 --> 13:20.775
Did you say those things, Mike?

13:20.776 --> 13:23.310
Ace play, Shakespeare.
Really.

13:23.311 --> 13:25.045
When in doubt,
call a vet an ape.

13:25.046 --> 13:27.714
Remind me, who did you
blackmail to get this job?

13:27.715 --> 13:30.717
All right, you know what?
Let's get in my office right now.

13:30.718 --> 13:32.653
- Your tea is almost ready.
- Thank you.

13:38.059 --> 13:41.796
Yet again we find
ourselves in an office

13:41.797 --> 13:45.366
that is completely
non-fucking-functioning.

13:45.367 --> 13:47.302
So what are we gonna do?

13:48.805 --> 13:52.174
Exactly.
We are gonna fire someone.

13:52.175 --> 13:55.010
That's right.
Does anybody have a better idea?

13:56.279 --> 13:59.614
All right, so...

13:59.615 --> 14:02.183
Who is it gonna be, huh?

14:03.752 --> 14:06.854
- Sue.
- Oh, Sue.

14:06.855 --> 14:08.355
That's funny, you guys.

14:08.356 --> 14:11.291
<i>But seriously,
Sue's not important enough.</i>

14:11.292 --> 14:12.992
Who is?

14:16.464 --> 14:18.766
Oh, I know.

14:18.767 --> 14:20.935
You three are important enough.

14:20.936 --> 14:23.838
Ma'am, I just want to say I
promise to do everything I can

14:23.839 --> 14:26.208
to fix Amy's botched
full disclosure policy

14:26.209 --> 14:27.976
and Mike's security blunder.

14:27.977 --> 14:31.013
Hey, suck-up isn't
gonna fix a fuck-up, Dan.

14:31.014 --> 14:32.782
All right?
You're not exempt.

14:34.618 --> 14:35.852
- Gary.
- Hmm?

14:35.853 --> 14:37.420
I need some sort
of discreet place

14:37.421 --> 14:39.790
where I can have a
rendezvous with Ted, please.

14:39.791 --> 14:41.591
- Where nobody goes.
- Yes, ma'am.

14:41.592 --> 14:44.327
Thank you. All right.

14:44.328 --> 14:47.163
You may leave my office now.

14:49.399 --> 14:51.801
<i>- Shut?
- Of course shut!</i>

14:53.603 --> 14:55.938
Oh, lord.

14:55.939 --> 14:58.441
Ooh, did you put a dash of...

14:58.442 --> 15:00.075
Honey in the rose hip?
Yes, ma'am.

15:00.076 --> 15:02.478
I put a little Fig Newton
there for you as well.

15:02.479 --> 15:06.215
- Oh, outstanding, Gary.
- Yeah.

15:15.326 --> 15:18.228
What?
Okay, I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

15:18.229 --> 15:20.031
- Another one.
- I understand.

15:20.032 --> 15:22.867
- Press is up my ass.
- Oh, so, okay, great.

15:22.868 --> 15:24.936
Then you know exactly
what my world is like.

15:24.937 --> 15:28.740
No, bullshit. I don't have a
Mike, an Amy, or fucking Dan.

15:28.741 --> 15:30.675
Oh, do you want them?
You can have them.

15:30.676 --> 15:32.978
I'll give you a fucking deal on all
three of them, too, if you want.

15:32.979 --> 15:34.880
That's a nice way
to treat people.

15:34.881 --> 15:37.449
- Well, that's how I feel.
- Here we go.

15:37.450 --> 15:39.251
<i>You don't have to be snarky about this.</i>

15:39.252 --> 15:41.453
Oh, my fucking lord!

15:41.454 --> 15:43.489
You really need
to calm down, okay?

15:43.490 --> 15:46.558
You need to respect
Gary's stuff here.

15:46.559 --> 15:48.895
<i>- Sorry, Gary.
- That's okay.</i>

15:48.896 --> 15:50.563
Look, this is
my fucking private life.

15:50.564 --> 15:53.166
- No, I know.
- I thought I was fucking you in private.

15:53.167 --> 15:56.937
Ted, come on.
I love to fuck you in private.

15:56.938 --> 15:59.139
Hey, you know what?
Thanks for returning my call.

15:59.140 --> 16:01.842
The message was, "please
don't fucking call me again."

16:01.843 --> 16:03.877
So why don't you just take
your beak and shove it up

16:03.878 --> 16:06.280
some corpse's ass, okay,
you vulture motherfucker?

16:06.281 --> 16:08.582
- Was that a journalist?
- Yes.

16:08.583 --> 16:10.718
- Oh, God!
- What?

16:10.719 --> 16:14.654
What are you doing, Ted?
You can't tell him to fuck his mother.

16:14.655 --> 16:16.823
- Her mother, actually.
- What the hell?

16:16.824 --> 16:18.858
- They...
- Come on, use your head.

16:18.859 --> 16:22.462
You're just making it worse.
Get yourself together.

16:22.463 --> 16:25.030
Selina, I need some air.

16:25.031 --> 16:26.632
And we need to talk.

16:35.141 --> 16:36.942
Uh, Gary?

16:36.943 --> 16:39.611
Yes, ma'am?

16:41.214 --> 16:43.749
- I'm gonna go.
- Okay. Okay.

16:43.750 --> 16:46.619
- I want you to stay here.
- Okay.

16:46.620 --> 16:48.955
I need you to end it with Ted.

16:48.956 --> 16:52.225
- Okay. What?
- Yeah, I want you to let him go.

16:52.226 --> 16:54.393
But you need to do it
very sensitively.

16:54.394 --> 16:57.729
And just make sure there
aren't any repercussions

16:57.730 --> 16:59.532
or anything like that, okay?

16:59.533 --> 17:03.235
Um, with all
due respect, ma'am,

17:03.236 --> 17:05.471
wouldn't it be better
if it came from you?

17:05.472 --> 17:07.673
- Mmm, uh-uh.
- No?

17:07.674 --> 17:11.743
No, because I can't run the
risk of talking to him again

17:11.744 --> 17:14.914
because I think that he
is about to dump me.

17:14.915 --> 17:18.750
So I'm not gonna be the dumpee.

17:18.751 --> 17:22.755
I'm gonna be the dumper.

17:22.756 --> 17:26.025
Okay?
He's gonna be the dumpee.

17:26.026 --> 17:27.693
So, you've got to go do that.

17:27.694 --> 17:30.462
Okay.

17:30.463 --> 17:33.198
Okay.
Okay.

17:33.199 --> 17:36.635
Oh, um, your house is so nice.

17:36.636 --> 17:38.504
Oh, thank you.
Thank you so much.

17:38.505 --> 17:40.739
It's really sweet
for you to say that.

17:40.740 --> 17:43.142
Okay.

17:52.586 --> 17:54.753
- She can go off, can't she?
- Yeah.

17:54.754 --> 17:57.189
- Yeah, sorry about that.
- That's okay.

17:57.190 --> 17:59.191
That's okay.

17:59.192 --> 18:01.427
So maybe it's a good thing.

18:03.930 --> 18:06.031
What?
What's a good thing?

18:06.032 --> 18:09.001
That she doesn't want
to see you anymore.

18:20.580 --> 18:23.349
Oh, ma'am. You've been
off radar for over an hour.

18:23.350 --> 18:25.384
Oh, did I miss anything?

18:25.385 --> 18:27.953
Did the president ride through
on a lion or something?

18:27.954 --> 18:31.323
No, but you need to do a drop-in
on the gaming association in 303.

18:31.324 --> 18:34.794
All right. I don't want to end up
with a horse's head in my bed.

18:34.795 --> 18:37.963
Though there's room
for one now.

18:40.433 --> 18:41.967
I just want to know.

18:41.968 --> 18:44.604
I hope you find out first.
I really do.

18:44.605 --> 18:46.806
Hey, you know what?
I get fired, it's a big fucking deal.

18:46.807 --> 18:48.074
For you, it's early retirement.

18:48.075 --> 18:49.876
Ah, that was fun.

18:49.877 --> 18:52.479
I just had a senior attorney
completely trash my yard.

18:52.480 --> 18:54.648
- You okay?
- Yeah, let me get you some coffee.

18:54.649 --> 18:56.249
What happened, buddy?
You want to talk about it?

18:56.250 --> 18:59.086
He completely tore it up.
I was afraid he was gonna cut my...

18:59.087 --> 19:01.188
Wait a second.
Did you just call me buddy?

19:01.189 --> 19:03.523
You don't listen to me.
You never listen to me. What's going on?

19:03.524 --> 19:05.625
<i>- Nothing.
- You want something from me.</i>

19:05.626 --> 19:08.295
You want me to tell you
who's getting fired.

19:08.296 --> 19:09.329
Come on, we just want
to know what she's thinking.

19:09.330 --> 19:11.097
I'm not gonna tell you
anything.

19:11.098 --> 19:13.433
All right, you know what?
Forget about the specifics.

19:13.434 --> 19:15.835
Let's pretend there's
a female farmer

19:15.836 --> 19:19.505
and she's got a horse,
a sheep, and a pig, okay?

19:19.506 --> 19:21.874
Who does she get rid of?

19:21.875 --> 19:24.009
The pig.

19:24.010 --> 19:25.443
Shit. Wait.
Who is that?

19:25.444 --> 19:28.680
Oh, come on.
Work it out.

19:28.681 --> 19:30.515
Why should I help you guys?

19:30.516 --> 19:33.785
- Gary, the veep needs her lunch.
- I'm on it.

19:33.786 --> 19:37.289
I'd rather be a pig than an
ass-monkey up on his high horse.

19:37.290 --> 19:39.024
There, that's three
animals for you.

19:45.398 --> 19:47.632
Did you just sidle?

19:47.633 --> 19:50.468
I don't think I've ever
seen you sidle.

19:50.469 --> 19:53.571
Look, Selina wants
to fire somebody.

19:53.572 --> 19:55.572
Obviously, I don't want
it to be me.

19:55.573 --> 19:57.107
But honestly,
I don't want it to be you.

19:57.108 --> 20:00.243
Oh, go on. Looking forward to
you selling this one to me.

20:00.244 --> 20:02.978
We should form a suicide pact.
All right?

20:02.979 --> 20:05.714
If she tries to fire me,
you walk and vice versa.

20:05.715 --> 20:07.649
She's not gonna fire
both of us.

20:07.650 --> 20:09.251
That would look like a crisis.

20:09.252 --> 20:12.120
Therefore, she can
fire neither of us.

20:12.121 --> 20:14.656
One condition...
I watch you die first

20:14.657 --> 20:18.159
and I get to stab you
repeatedly to make sure.

20:19.629 --> 20:22.197
McLintock wants in
on the suicide pact.

20:22.198 --> 20:25.067
- What?
- Yeah. A classic move.

20:25.068 --> 20:27.437
I did one of these
back in the '90s

20:27.438 --> 20:29.072
when I worked for
congressman Hartigan.

20:29.073 --> 20:31.809
Why would we let you
in on our suicide pact?

20:31.810 --> 20:33.911
Because three
is better than two.

20:33.912 --> 20:36.413
Not with testicles.

20:41.286 --> 20:45.355
I came across a little email

20:45.356 --> 20:48.057
from you to Macauley's
chief of staff.

20:48.058 --> 20:49.459
I don't know what
you're talking about.

20:49.460 --> 20:51.360
You don't know about an email
that basically confirms

20:51.361 --> 20:54.397
you had talks
with senator Macauley?

20:54.398 --> 20:56.967
What exactly did
this email say?

20:56.968 --> 20:58.902
Oh, just something like,

20:58.903 --> 21:01.605
"the senator says,
'thanks, buddy.'"

21:01.606 --> 21:03.474
Well, that's hardly
incriminating.

21:03.475 --> 21:05.409
There's probably more
where that came from.

21:05.410 --> 21:08.245
I'm getting really good
at dacting.

21:08.246 --> 21:09.847
Do you mean un-redacting?

21:09.848 --> 21:13.084
- Taking the black off.
- Yeah, yeah.

21:13.085 --> 21:15.686
Hey, so goofball here
can get in on the suicide pact.

21:15.687 --> 21:17.656
Well, great.
The more the merrier.

21:17.657 --> 21:20.025
Team Suicide.

21:20.026 --> 21:23.596
So what happened with
your Hartigan suicide pact?

21:23.597 --> 21:26.633
Oh, we got fired.

21:26.634 --> 21:29.202
Okay, kittens.
Time to get drowned. Let's go.

21:29.203 --> 21:31.138
- Ma'am.
- Yeah.

21:33.040 --> 21:35.108
Gary, where were you
and Selina at lunchtime today?

21:35.109 --> 21:37.910
- We were at my place.
- That's not protocol.

21:37.911 --> 21:40.680
Don't be jealous that
we've taken that step, Sue.

21:40.681 --> 21:42.081
I'm closer to her than you are.

21:42.082 --> 21:43.615
What?

21:43.616 --> 21:45.116
Gary, this is not
a competition.

21:45.117 --> 21:47.018
Too late.
What's her shoe size?

21:47.019 --> 21:49.687
- Seven.
- Seven and a half.

21:49.688 --> 21:51.489
Okay, who are the two cousins
she never wants to see?

21:51.490 --> 21:53.993
Beverly and Michael.

21:53.994 --> 21:56.662
<i>- Oh, got lucky there.
- Here's the deal, Sue.</i>

21:56.663 --> 21:58.598
You can't win, all right?

21:58.599 --> 22:01.167
Basically,
I'm infallible, okay?

22:01.168 --> 22:05.072
Like when you bought pregnancy tests
for the veep wearing your staff ID?

22:06.741 --> 22:08.509
Infallible like that, Gary?

22:10.546 --> 22:13.548
Gary, look, a staffer
at the "Post" told me.

22:13.549 --> 22:16.984
The guy at the drugstore saw
the badge and sold the story.

22:16.985 --> 22:20.021
Sorry, Gary.

22:20.022 --> 22:22.757
Which is why if one
of us goes, we all go.

22:25.528 --> 22:28.730
Huh. Okay.
Then you're all...

22:28.731 --> 22:31.532
Which is why that
was just a hypothetical.

22:31.533 --> 22:34.369
That's the exact word
that I'd use for this, Mike.

22:34.370 --> 22:36.337
High-pathetic.

22:36.338 --> 22:40.007
Dan, are you telling me that if I
fired either one of these bozos,

22:40.008 --> 22:42.342
- you would have resigned?
- No, ma'am.

22:42.343 --> 22:44.920
I was never really committed
to this as an idea.

22:44.921 --> 22:46.221
Right, yeah.

22:46.222 --> 22:47.880
This was a big mistake.
Kind of a joke, really.

22:47.881 --> 22:50.149
Thanks, guys.

22:50.150 --> 22:54.219
Mike, you can't even announce
a suicide pact correctly.

22:54.220 --> 22:56.888
<i>Dan folded pretty quick.</i>

22:56.889 --> 22:59.258
Yeah, come in.

23:00.794 --> 23:02.828
Oh, Gary, I need advil.

23:02.829 --> 23:05.897
I've got a headache
the size of Nebraska.

23:05.898 --> 23:08.900
- I'm afraid I can't do that, ma'am.
- What is this?

23:08.901 --> 23:12.037
I have loved this job more
than I've loved life itself.

23:12.038 --> 23:14.606
- Uh-huh.
- Well, equally, 'cause it's been my life.

23:14.607 --> 23:17.576
- And my feelings for you...
- Okay.

23:17.577 --> 23:19.111
Gary, what is this?

23:19.112 --> 23:20.947
It's my letter of resignation.

23:20.948 --> 23:23.116
Okay, Gary, come on.

23:23.117 --> 23:24.584
Is this because your pass
was seen at the drugstore?

23:24.585 --> 23:28.322
- You knew?
- Is that how the pregnancy story got out?

23:28.323 --> 23:31.024
I mean, seriously.
I am not gonna let go

23:31.025 --> 23:33.260
the one person
in this core group

23:33.261 --> 23:35.495
that actually gives
a shit about me.

23:35.496 --> 23:37.864
Okay, Gary, get a hold of yourself.
I mean, ser...

23:37.865 --> 23:40.800
Who dumped Ted for me today.
Thank you, by the way, for doing that.

23:40.801 --> 23:42.535
It was really nice of you.
I appreciate that.

23:42.536 --> 23:45.437
My God, resignation completely
rejected, all right?

23:45.438 --> 23:47.906
- Would you please get me some ibuprofen?
- I'm your rock.

23:47.907 --> 23:49.675
- Okay, but I need ibuprofen.
- Okay.

23:49.676 --> 23:54.213
All right, suicide pact
finished, okay?

23:54.214 --> 23:56.883
- You can get out.
- Okay.

23:59.053 --> 24:01.154
Uh, except you, Ame.

24:01.155 --> 24:03.256
- Ma'am?
- Mm-hmm.

24:06.594 --> 24:09.196
- Just have a seat.
- Please, you have to...

24:09.197 --> 24:12.032
Amy, just sit down, okay?
Just sit down.

24:13.969 --> 24:16.637
Um, what are we
gonna do with you?

24:16.638 --> 24:19.106
What does that mean?

24:19.107 --> 24:21.475
I think you kind of know
what it means, right?

24:22.577 --> 24:24.211
How are we gonna fix this?

24:26.347 --> 24:28.614
Okay, um...

24:30.450 --> 24:32.718
Um, okay, okay.

24:32.719 --> 24:35.021
We could do a piece

24:35.022 --> 24:39.226
in a sympathetic women's magazine
about the loss of the baby.

24:39.227 --> 24:42.763
Buy you some time
and some goodwill.

24:42.764 --> 24:45.232
No, you're right.
We can't do that.

24:45.233 --> 24:47.468
Um...

24:51.174 --> 24:55.076
So why don't...

24:56.345 --> 24:59.781
we say some of us
mishandled things

24:59.782 --> 25:03.418
because you were pregnant?

25:03.419 --> 25:06.688
I mean... no, no.
No, stupid idea.

25:06.689 --> 25:09.358
Okay.

25:09.359 --> 25:12.861
Or, we...

25:12.862 --> 25:14.830
Could say

25:14.831 --> 25:18.134
the pregnancy test was for me.

25:19.970 --> 25:24.540
Oh, you mean that would be why you
reassigned the secret service guy?

25:24.541 --> 25:27.944
'Cause you were feeling
too much pressure.

25:27.945 --> 25:30.713
Baby on board.
That kind of thing?

25:30.714 --> 25:32.081
Is that what you mean?

25:32.082 --> 25:34.650
Yeah, we could mention that.

25:34.651 --> 25:37.420
Okay, well, it's like
the old Amy talking there.

25:37.421 --> 25:41.557
I mean, I can't tell you
what to do.

25:41.558 --> 25:44.193
It's kind of a personal thing.

25:44.194 --> 25:46.496
But it's really good
to hear you're thinking.

25:46.497 --> 25:50.333
I need something for my head.

25:56.373 --> 25:58.307
There have been rumors
flying around

25:58.308 --> 26:01.110
about a pregnancy in the vice
president's office.

26:01.111 --> 26:03.078
<i>- Yeah, I had heard.
- Yeah, well,</i>

26:03.079 --> 26:05.047
the baby was mine.

26:05.048 --> 26:06.949
Was yours?

26:06.950 --> 26:09.017
Yes, I had a miscarriage.

26:09.018 --> 26:11.753
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- Mmm.

26:11.754 --> 26:15.456
I just wanted to explain
the state of mind I was in

26:15.457 --> 26:18.827
when I made the decision
to reassign Mr. Collins.

26:18.828 --> 26:21.562
- I see.
- Knockity knock knock knock.

26:21.563 --> 26:23.964
Janet, hey.
I didn't know you were here.

26:23.965 --> 26:25.232
Hey, Amers,
going on a muffin run.

26:25.233 --> 26:27.734
Can I interest you in
a blueberry bran muffin?

26:27.735 --> 26:29.602
- Anybody?
- I couldn't. Do you?

26:29.603 --> 26:32.372
- No, I'm fine. Thanks.
- Okay. No problem.

26:32.373 --> 26:35.375
I will stand down.
Peep you later.

26:35.376 --> 26:38.278
- What?
- Peep you later.

26:38.279 --> 26:41.015
Okay, thank you, Mike.

26:42.318 --> 26:45.020
Do you think you're ready
to be back at work?

26:45.021 --> 26:47.122
Sure.
Sure, yeah.

26:47.123 --> 26:48.623
<i>- Hey.
- Hi.</i>

26:48.624 --> 26:51.059
Hi. Sorry to interrupt.

26:51.060 --> 26:53.895
We're getting a little
lunch from the deli.

26:53.896 --> 26:55.730
Wondered if you wanted anything
special from the menu.

26:55.731 --> 26:57.566
Thanks, buddy.

26:57.567 --> 27:00.968
Dan is so good.
He's come such a long way.

27:00.969 --> 27:02.403
Would you like Dan
to get you anything?

27:02.404 --> 27:04.939
An iced tea would be great.

27:04.940 --> 27:06.774
You know what?
That sounds really good.

27:06.775 --> 27:08.843
- Make that two.
- Two iced teas.

27:08.844 --> 27:10.812
Thanks.
Oh, and not from here.

27:10.813 --> 27:13.047
From the place that we like
eight blocks away.

27:13.048 --> 27:14.114
Sure, okay.

27:14.115 --> 27:16.016
Is he the father?

27:16.017 --> 27:18.353
Oh, no, no.

27:18.354 --> 27:20.454
Father, no.

27:21.856 --> 27:23.824
He can't.
