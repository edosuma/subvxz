THE DRAGON: In a land of myth
and a time of magic,

00:05.631 --> 00:10.678
the destiny of a great kingdom rests
on the shoulders of a young boy.

00:10.761 --> 00:13.681
His name, Merlin.

00:18.686 --> 00:19.770
Morgana.

00:19.854 --> 00:22.273
You don't know how much I regret
everything that I've done.

00:23.482 --> 00:26.777
The mandrake pierces
the very recesses of the soul,

00:26.861 --> 00:31.532
twisting the unconscious to the very
image of fear and dread.

than it's been for years.

00:37.788 --> 00:40.291
An assault of Camelot
cannot be undertaken lightly.

00:40.625 --> 00:43.586
You forget,
we have an ally in the court.

00:45.630 --> 00:47.590
So you believe we have a traitor
in Camelot.

00:47.965 --> 00:51.260
-Merlin suspects me.
-Well, then we must stop him.

00:53.888 --> 00:57.600
When Cenred marches on Camelot,
he will find a kingdom without a leader.

00:59.018 --> 01:00.061
(SHOUTS)

02:08.086 --> 02:11.132
- I didn't think you'd answer my call.
-Merlin.

02:11.215 --> 02:14.552
| could not resist a dragon lord.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.679

-The Serket's poison is powerful.

02:31.527 --> 02:34.739
| have given you an enchantment
that will help you heal.

02:35.740 --> 02:37.950
But it will take time.

02:41.746 --> 02:43.789
-Where is that half-wit?
-Merlin?

02:43.873 --> 02:48.044
I've got no socks, no breeches,
and an archery session to go to. Merlin!

02:48.127 --> 02:50.629
| thought he was with you, sire.

02:50.713 --> 02:52.131
Don't try and cover for him.

02:52.214 --> 02:54.717
He didn't come home last night.
| can't find him.

02:54.800 --> 02:57.887
When you do, you can tell him,
he's the target.

You shouldn't have let me sleep.

04:42.533 --> 04:45.244
| had no choice, young warlock.

04:45.327 --> 04:50.291
The venom was too strong.
Even for your great powers.

| don't have time.
| need to get back to Camelot.

04:55.838 --> 04:58.215
The kingdom is in danger.

05:00.217 --> 05:01.760
And it was my fault.

05:02.553 --> 05:04.221
| should've listened to you.

05:04.930 --> 05:08.767
- I should never have trusted Morgana.
-You did what you felt was right.

05:09.101 --> 05:11.103
And that shows great courage.

05:12.188 --> 05:13.814
But trust,

05:14.398 --> 05:16.317
is a double-edged sword.

05:17.485 --> 05:21.197
| thought, if she has magic, I thought,

05:22.239 --> 05:25.367
-we were the same.
-In some ways you are.

05:26.452 --> 05:27.495
No.

05:29.038 --> 05:30.372
I'll never be like her.

05:30.456 --> 05:33.751
You have learnt
an important lesson, Merlin.

05:34.460 --> 05:38.422
Your determination to see
goodness in people,

05:38.506 --> 05:40.591
will be your undoing.

05:42.301 --> 05:45.304
But I fear that your futures

05:45.387 --> 05:47.973
are now joined forever.

05:49.058 --> 05:52.520
She is the darkness to your light.

05:58.692 --> 06:03.697
You're not yet fully recovered, Merlin,
and it's more than three days' walk.

I've no intention of walking.

-Thank you.

06:39.733 --> 06:43.070
- Won't forget this.
-Be careful, young warlock.

06:43.153 --> 06:47.408

You must be strong.

Morgana is in league with Morgause.
She's plotting against Uther.

07:26.989 --> 07:30.034
She's responsible for his visions.
Come on, hurry up.

It was an enchantment, sire.

08:47.986 --> 08:49.947
You need to rest.

09:03.627 --> 09:04.920
Please drink this, sire.

09:08.507 --> 09:10.217
It will help you to sleep.

09:25.315 --> 09:27.151
We must tell Uther
what Morgana has done.

09:28.068 --> 09:29.445
Are you mad?

09:29.528 --> 09:33.741
He'd have both our heads if we made such
accusations. He'd look on it as treason.

09:33.824 --> 09:34.950
We can't just let her get away with it.

09:35.284 --> 09:38.120
He dotes on her every word, Merlin.

09:39.496 --> 09:40.581
If he knew...

09:40.664 --> 09:42.541
You've seen how blind he is
to her faults.

09:44.710 --> 09:47.421
Besides, the root is gone now.

09:47.880 --> 09:50.507
-It can do no more harm.
-No, you don't understand.

-Well...
-Merlin.

Ah, yes. I can see that you've got
all the makings of a great king.

-Much better.

12:00.554 --> 12:02.764
We found the source of his sickness.

12:03.265 --> 12:04.725
He was being enchanted.

Enchanted?

12:09.313 --> 12:10.480
You need not worry, my lady.

12:11.315 --> 12:12.941
He'll make a full recovery.

tried to poison his beloved ward.

-Cenred, sire.

13:17.547 --> 13:20.133

-How many men?

Twenty thousand, maybe more.

-Then we must find a way to appease him.

That's not what my father would do.
He wouldn't bow to our enemies.

Forgive me, sire, we are outnumbered
two to one.

13:35.983 --> 13:39.444
What concessions will Cenred insist on?
What territories will he demand?

13:39.528 --> 13:43.073
We do not have to give him anything,
but it could buy us valuable time...

13:43.156 --> 13:44.282
It shows weakness, Gaius.

13:47.619 --> 13:49.705
There's only one course of action
open to us.

13:53.542 --> 13:55.544
We must prepare the city for siege.

13:56.336 --> 13:57.504

The castle is our strongest weapon.
No army has ever taken Camelot.

-What?

21:02.846 --> 21:04.180
It's time.

21:20.363 --> 21:22.365
| promise I will not let you down.

22:31.935 --> 22:33.102
Sorry.

22:35.355 --> 22:37.815
It's not like you to get nervous,
is it, Merlin?

22:39.025 --> 22:41.444
-I'm not nervous.
-No?

22:45.114 --> 22:46.616
Because I trust in your destiny.

22:49.494 --> 22:51.287
Have you been on the cider?

22:58.711 --> 23:00.296
It is your fate.

23:01.548 --> 23:03.466
To be the greatest king that
Camelot's ever known.

23:05.802 --> 23:07.971
And your victory today
will be remembered,

23:09.931 --> 23:11.391
by every age.

23:12.475 --> 23:14.269
Till the end of time.

23:23.820 --> 23:25.405
Just trust in yourself.

23:36.791 --> 23:40.086
There are times, Merlin,
when you display a sort of,

23:40.920 --> 23:42.255
| don't know what it is.

23:44.632 --> 23:46.092
| don't know what to say...

23:47.885 --> 23:49.178
It's not wisdom.

23:57.186 --> 24:01.190
But, yes. That's what it is.

24:05.528 --> 24:08.781
Don't look so pleased. The rest
of the time, you're a complete idiot.

24:38.019 --> 24:39.812
For the love of Camelot!

24:39.896 --> 24:42.482
ALL: For the love of Camelot.

25:16.808 --> 25:18.434
(SHOUTING) Fire!

25:19.060 --> 25:21.854
(ALL SHOUTING)

26:15.324 --> 26:16.826
Hold the line.

26:19.829 --> 26:21.831
You need to go back, sire.

26:30.423 --> 26:31.466
Gaius!

26:32.467 --> 26:33.968
One of us needs to keep an eye on her.

26:34.343 --> 26:36.679
-Don't worry, I am.
-You mustn't let her out of your sight.

26:40.641 --> 26:42.185
| need to get back to Arthur.

27:41.035 --> 27:43.538
Father!

27:47.750 --> 27:49.418
-What are you doing?
-You're not well.

27:49.502 --> 27:51.420
This is my kingdom!

27:58.594 --> 28:00.721
Pull back! Retreat!

28:09.605 --> 28:11.107
(CASTING SPELL)

29:06.495 --> 29:07.622
(LOUD CLANGING)

29:26.515 --> 29:28.643
You must get back to the battle with us
in the lower town.

29:28.726 --> 29:30.102
It's already lost, Father.

29:30.186 --> 29:31.771
-And the citadel?
-Safe for now.

29:31.854 --> 29:33.064
It must stay that way.

29:33.147 --> 29:35.274
You've got to trust me, Father.
| know what I'm doing.

29:35.358 --> 29:36.400
(GROANING)

29:37.485 --> 29:38.861
You must rest, sire.

29:38.945 --> 29:41.530
When you are well again, you'll still
have a kingdom, I promise you that.

29:48.329 --> 29:49.830
The lower town is ours.

29:49.914 --> 29:51.624
Then we'll hardly fill
the pages of history.

29:52.291 --> 29:54.001
What of the citadel itself?

29:54.794 --> 29:56.712
Their defenses are strong.

29:57.380 --> 29:59.382
Time for you to deliver
your side of the bargain.

29:59.465 --> 30:01.258
Patience, Cenred.

30:01.342 --> 30:03.052
You will not be disappointed.

30:15.356 --> 30:17.108
-Where's Gaius?
-I don't know.

30:22.405 --> 30:23.572
Morgana's disappeared.

30:48.514 --> 30:50.182
(GRUNTING)

31:07.658 --> 31:10.870
Enough of your games, Morgause.
What has happened to your traitor?

31:11.787 --> 31:14.290
For such a great king,
you have very little patience.

31:14.498 --> 31:16.125
The time for patience is over.

31:17.084 --> 31:18.627
You need not worry much longer.

31:19.211 --> 31:21.213
No army can fight on two fronts.

31:21.797 --> 31:24.133
Not even the knights of Camelot.

32:22.149 --> 32:23.317
Take him to hospital.

32:25.528 --> 32:26.570
Merlin!

32:28.030 --> 32:30.991
-Where the hell have you been?
-Nowhere.

32:31.075 --> 32:33.035
Starting to make a habit of this.
What's your excuse this time?

32:34.036 --> 32:36.413
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

32:36.497 --> 32:38.791
Come on, Merlin,
you can do better than that.

33:57.328 --> 33:59.955
You need to warn Gaius,
tell him to seal off the hospital.

34:05.211 --> 34:06.629
Merlin, do as I say.

34:10.799 --> 34:12.051
| have to get out there.

34:12.134 --> 34:15.554
No, sire. You're still weak from the
medicine I gave you. I told you that...

34:15.638 --> 34:18.056
| cannot watch my kingdom fall
and do nothing.

34:18.139 --> 34:19.766
Arthur will defend it.

34:21.768 --> 34:22.811
Gaius.

34:25.438 --> 34:29.400
You need to seal off the hospital.
The castle is under attack from within.

34:29.485 --> 34:31.320
-What are you talking about?
-Morgana.

34:31.402 --> 34:33.906
She's summoned an army of the dead.
They're everywhere.

34:33.989 --> 34:35.114
Where are you going?

34:36.699 --> 34:38.494
To try and stop her.

35:18.117 --> 35:19.285
On me!

35:28.168 --> 35:30.838
-We can't fight a battle on two fronts.
-Keep still.

35:31.880 --> 35:33.465
| don't know how much longer
we can hold the citadel.

35:33.549 --> 35:35.009
We need to my father to safety.

35:35.092 --> 35:37.803
How?
We no longer control the lower town.

35:37.886 --> 35:39.054
There's no escape, Arthur.

35:45.769 --> 35:47.521
You should leave now,
while you still can.

35:48.230 --> 35:49.648
Morgana, please, I beg you.

35:49.732 --> 35:51.400
(RUMBLING)

35:56.739 --> 35:59.283
Women and children are dying.
The city will fall.

35:59.742 --> 36:00.826
Good.

36:01.910 --> 36:03.203
No, you don't mean that.

36:04.246 --> 36:05.539
| have magic, Merlin.

36:07.249 --> 36:09.168
Uther hates me and everyone like me.

36:09.251 --> 36:11.128
Why should I feel
any differently about him?

36:11.587 --> 36:13.547
You of all people
could change Uther's mind.

36:13.630 --> 36:16.675
But doing this, using magic like this
will only harden his heart.

36:16.759 --> 36:20.679
You don't have magic, Merlin.
How could you hope to understand?

36:20.763 --> 36:22.806
| do understand, believe me.

36:27.311 --> 36:29.646
If I had your gifts,
| would harness it for good.

36:29.730 --> 36:30.939
That's what magic should be for.

36:31.023 --> 36:32.441
That's why you were born
with these powers.

36:32.524 --> 36:34.610
You don't know what it's like
to be an outsider.

36:35.694 --> 36:38.447
To be ashamed of how you were born.
To have to hide who you are.

36:40.908 --> 36:43.535
Do you think I deserve to be executed
because of who I am?

36:45.662 --> 36:46.705
No.

36:49.291 --> 36:50.626
It doesn't have to be like this.

36:53.545 --> 36:55.172
We can find another way.

36:57.299 --> 36:58.675
There is no other way.

37:12.523 --> 37:14.566
(BOTH GRUNTING)

37:16.819 --> 37:19.029
What are you going to do? Kill me?

37:19.446 --> 37:20.656
You don't think I can?

37:23.575 --> 37:24.993
If you're going to do it, make it quick.

37:28.747 --> 37:29.957
(GASPS)

38:29.349 --> 38:30.684
(SPEAKING A SPELL)

38:40.402 --> 38:41.570
(SPEAKING A SPELL)

39:59.982 --> 40:02.234
Your traitor has failed us,
just as I knew they would.

40:02.818 --> 40:04.736
-I'm calling off the siege.
-You can't.

40:04.820 --> 40:08.031
| cannot take the city unaided.
That was not our bargain.

40:08.115 --> 40:11.410
-You have failed me, Cenred.
- would rather fail you, Morgause,

40:11.493 --> 40:13.495
than watch thousands of men die.

40:29.845 --> 40:32.264
-Sire.
-What is it?

40:32.347 --> 40:35.017
| need to tell you
something about Morgana.

40:35.100 --> 40:37.853
-It's all right. I know what happened.
-You do?

40:41.231 --> 40:43.400
In my time, we've won many battles,

40:44.234 --> 40:45.861
but none so important as this.

40:46.903 --> 40:50.115
Every man, every woman and child,

40:50.198 --> 40:52.284
has performed their heroic best.

40:52.367 --> 40:55.370
And I thank you, and I salute you all.

40:57.039 --> 41:00.542
Even before the battle, we knew
there was a traitor in our midst.

41:03.295 --> 41:05.881
One who was almost the undoing of us.

41:07.049 --> 41:10.385
However, we have to thank the one person

41:11.261 --> 41:12.596
who outwitted them.

41:13.805 --> 41:17.392
And who almost singlehandedly
turned the battle,

41:18.352 --> 41:19.561
the Lady Morgana.

41:26.193 --> 41:28.987
For it was she who
bravely entered the vault,

41:29.446 --> 41:31.907
found the magical vessel
and destroyed it.

41:34.034 --> 41:35.494
We must be vigilant.

41:37.287 --> 41:41.249
We must stand firm
against the dark forces of magic.

41:41.667 --> 41:43.251
And ensure,

41:43.752 --> 41:44.795
that they never,

41:45.295 --> 41:47.339
penetrate our walls again.

42:02.562 --> 42:04.606
Why is Uther so blind
to her true nature?

42:06.108 --> 42:07.109
| don't know, Merlin.

42:09.277 --> 42:10.320
It's a mystery.

42:11.822 --> 42:14.116
But Morgana will try again.

42:15.534 --> 42:18.453
-I'll be ready for her.
-You must be careful.

42:20.372 --> 42:22.749
-I'm not afraid of her, Gaius.
-You should be.

42:25.168 --> 42:27.462
No, all I feel for her is,

42:28.296 --> 42:29.381
sad.

42:32.342 --> 42:35.303
She's become so bitter, so full of hate.

42:38.432 --> 42:40.308
Don't let that happen to you, Merlin.

42:44.479 --> 42:46.148
Nothing could ever make me that angry.

42:46.857 --> 42:48.066
ARTHUR: Merlin!

42:50.819 --> 42:52.487
Get your lazy backside out here.

42:54.322 --> 42:55.323
On second thoughts...

43:00.871 --> 43:02.080
Merlin.

43:02.873 --> 43:03.915
Boo!

43:05.041 --> 43:07.335
GAIUS: It seems you have
unleashed a goblin.

43:08.170 --> 43:10.839
That's not Gaius.
He's been possessed by a goblin.

43:14.301 --> 43:16.762
-I'm going to the tavern.
-You never go to the tavern.

43:16.845 --> 43:19.014
(ALL CHEERING)

43:19.097 --> 43:20.265
(PASSING WIND)

43:20.348 --> 43:22.225
Tell me you didn't think that was funny?

43:22.309 --> 43:23.894
(BURPING LOUDLY)

43:23.977 --> 43:27.689
Your magic may be powerful,
but I have an advantage.

43:27.981 --> 43:30.484
-What's that?
-I can hurt you,

43:30.567 --> 43:34.362
whereas you cannot hurt me
without hurting Gaius.
