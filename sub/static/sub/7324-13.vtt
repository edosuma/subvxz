I DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU DO IT.

07:51.201 --> 07:52.773
AND THEN WITH THE KIDS, TOO?

07:52.773 --> 07:56.076
MM. WELL... (chuckles) YOU'LL
FIND OUT SOON ENOUGH, RIGHT?

07:56.076 --> 07:57.548
(laughs)

07:57.548 --> 07:59.910
OH, BESIDES, YOU AND DEREK
WILL BE FINE.

07:59.910 --> 08:01.982
YOU TWO ARE PERFECT.

08:01.982 --> 08:04.985
♪♪♪

08:07.588 --> 08:09.590
ALL ELLIS IS SAYING

08:09.590 --> 08:11.592
IS THAT SHE WANTS YOU
TO USE YOUR FULL POTENTIAL.

08:11.592 --> 08:13.524
MM-HMM.
OH, HI, HONEY.

08:13.524 --> 08:14.525
HI.

08:14.525 --> 08:17.197
LIKE THAT CLINICAL TRIAL
YOU USED TO TALK ABOUT.

08:17.197 --> 08:18.869
I'M ABOUT TO HAVE
A CHILD, RICHARD.

08:18.869 --> 08:20.701
I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR A CLINICAL TRIAL.

08:20.701 --> 08:22.533
I THINK YOU SHOULD
FIND IT.

08:22.533 --> 08:25.676
I THINK IT'LL DO YOU GOOD.

08:25.676 --> 08:28.679
(indistinct conversations)

08:29.840 --> 08:31.612
GOOD MORNING.

08:31.612 --> 08:32.913
MM.

08:32.913 --> 08:37.217
(indistinct conversations
continue)

08:37.217 --> 08:38.589
A CLINICAL TRIAL--

08:38.589 --> 08:40.050
THIS ELEVATOR
IS NOT WORKING.

08:40.050 --> 08:42.252
OH.

08:42.252 --> 08:44.625
WHAT AN ASS.

08:44.625 --> 08:45.926
(indistinct conversations)

08:45.926 --> 08:47.928
WE BROUGHT YOU A COKEHEAD
FOUND IN AN ALLEY.

08:47.928 --> 08:50.931
PRESUMED OVERDOSE.
TRIED NARCAN. NO RESPONSE.

08:50.931 --> 08:53.634
HAD TO SHOCK HER ONCE
IN THE FIELD AT 300.

08:53.634 --> 08:55.666
B.P. IS 80 OVER 60.

08:55.666 --> 08:58.739
SATs 96 ON 100%.

08:58.739 --> 09:01.311
ALL RIGHT. ON MY COUNT.

09:01.311 --> 09:02.973
ONE...
(monitor beeping erratically)

09:02.973 --> 09:05.646
STOP. V-FIB.
CHARGE THE PADDLES TO 300.

09:05.646 --> 09:06.747
(beeping continues)
CLEAR!

09:06.747 --> 09:08.278
(paddles thunk)

09:08.278 --> 09:10.851
(beeping stops)
THERE WE GO.

09:10.851 --> 09:12.082
READY?
ON MY COUNT.

09:12.082 --> 09:13.654
ONE, TWO...

09:13.654 --> 09:16.026
THREE.

09:16.026 --> 09:17.688
AVERY, SHE'S ALL YOURS.

09:17.688 --> 09:19.660
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET
A TOX SCREEN, AN E.K.G.,

09:19.660 --> 09:21.331
A C.B.C., A C.M.P.,
AND AN X-RAY NOW.

09:21.331 --> 09:23.333
(woman) RIGHT AWAY, DOCTOR.

09:39.650 --> 09:40.811
(Ellis) WELL, IT'S
A STROKE OF LUCK, ACTUALLY.

09:40.811 --> 09:42.152
I'M DOING A SURGERY TODAY,

09:42.152 --> 09:43.583
AND I'M PLANNING TO USE
THE NEW GREY TECHNIQUE.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.856
SO RATHER THAN
A BORING PRESS INTERVIEW,

09:45.856 --> 09:48.158
WHY DON'T YOU COME ON UP
TO THE GALLERY,

09:48.158 --> 09:49.690
TAKE A FEW SHOTS OF
THE TECHNIQUE IN ACTION...
(camera shutter clicking)

09:49.690 --> 09:51.692
AND, UH, WE'LL TALK AFTER?

09:51.692 --> 09:53.023
I'LL SEE YOU IN THE O.R.

09:53.023 --> 09:54.194
(woman) GREAT. SOUNDS GOOD.
THANK YOU.

09:54.194 --> 09:55.365
(man) ALL RIGHT.

09:55.365 --> 09:56.697
(man) OKAY, THANKS.

09:56.697 --> 09:58.068
THAT WAS BRILLIANT.

09:58.068 --> 10:00.300
WHY SETTLE FOR ANOTHER
BORING PRESS RELEASE, RIGHT?

10:00.300 --> 10:02.302
(laughs)
SO CAN I SCRUB IN?

10:02.302 --> 10:04.705
I WOULD LOVE TO SEE
THE PROCEDURE DONE FIRSTHAND.

10:04.705 --> 10:06.276
WHY? YOUR FOCUS IS CARDIO.

10:06.276 --> 10:07.738
YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET
A CARDIO FELLOWSHIP

10:07.738 --> 10:09.609
SCRUBBING IN
ON YOUR MOTHER'S WHIPPLE.

10:09.609 --> 10:10.681
(elevator bell dings)

10:10.681 --> 10:12.182
THAT'S TRUE.

10:12.182 --> 10:15.385
CRISTINA YANG IS DOING
A SOLO AORTIC ANEURYSM TODAY.

10:15.385 --> 10:18.048
I--THAT CAME IN LAST NIGHT,
AND HAD I BEEN HERE--

10:18.048 --> 10:19.319
YEAH, BUT YOU WEREN'T

10:19.319 --> 10:20.651
BECAUSE YOU WERE TOO BUSY
GETTING ENGAGED.

10:20.651 --> 10:23.253
SO NOW THAT THAT'S OVER,
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

10:23.253 --> 10:25.796
DO YOU WANT TO DO
AN AORTIC ANEURYSM?

10:25.796 --> 10:26.757
YES.

10:26.757 --> 10:27.998
DO YOU WANT ME
TO ASK DR. TORRES

10:27.998 --> 10:29.199
TO GIVE IT TO YOU?

10:29.199 --> 10:32.162
NO, MOTHER.
I CAN GET IT MYSELF.

10:32.162 --> 10:33.734
THERE YOU GO.

10:33.734 --> 10:36.136
(indistinct conversations)

10:36.136 --> 10:37.768
(sighs)

10:37.768 --> 10:39.269
DR. BAILEY.
(elevator bell dings)

10:39.269 --> 10:41.211
I AM STOKED
FOR OUR WHIPPLE TODAY.

10:41.211 --> 10:42.272
ARE YOU STOKED?

10:42.272 --> 10:43.944
WE, UH...

10:43.944 --> 10:45.345
(sighs) NO, WE'RE NOT...

10:45.345 --> 10:47.117
YOU GOTTA SPEAK UP.

10:47.117 --> 10:49.049
WE'RE NOT DOING
A WHIPPLE TODAY.

10:49.049 --> 10:51.021
I HAD IT TAKEN FROM ME.

10:51.021 --> 10:52.953
MANDY. NO.

10:52.953 --> 10:54.424
PLEASE DON'T CALL ME MANDY.

10:54.424 --> 10:55.826
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS.

10:55.826 --> 10:57.657
YOU CAN'T LET PEOPLE
WALK ALL OVER YOU.

10:57.657 --> 10:58.989
YOU GOTTA STAND UP
FOR YOURSELF.

10:58.989 --> 11:00.831
NOT IF IT'S ELLIS GREY,
I DON'T.

11:00.831 --> 11:02.362
ELLIS IS OPERATING?

11:02.362 --> 11:04.835
COME ON.

11:04.835 --> 11:06.136
THE NEXT BEST THING
TO OPERATING

11:06.136 --> 11:07.938
IS WATCHING ELLIS GREY
DO IT.
(sighs)

11:07.938 --> 11:10.170
WE GOTTA GET IN
ON THAT SURGERY, MANDY.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.671
REMEMBER WHAT WE SAY?

11:11.671 --> 11:13.774
I DON'T REMEMBER
WHAT WE SAY.

11:13.774 --> 11:15.105
WE CREATE...

11:15.105 --> 11:17.147
OH, WE CREATE
OUR OWN DESTINY.

11:17.147 --> 11:18.779
OUR OWN DESTINY.
THAT'S RIGHT. COME ON.

11:18.779 --> 11:20.110
(elevator bell dings)
CHOP, CHOP.

11:20.110 --> 11:23.113
(siren wailing)

11:23.113 --> 11:26.116
(indistinct conversations)

11:27.858 --> 11:28.819
HI THERE.

11:28.819 --> 11:30.360
OH, GOD.

11:30.360 --> 11:31.862
UGH. WHAT NOW?

11:31.862 --> 11:33.293
WELL, YOU O.D.'ed,

11:33.293 --> 11:36.026
YOUR HEART STOPPED,
BUT YOU'RE STABLE.

11:36.026 --> 11:37.828
CAN I GET A NAME, PLEASE?

11:37.828 --> 11:39.069
OH, SO YOU CAN CALL
THE COPS?

11:39.069 --> 11:41.071
NAH, I JUST NEED
ANYTHING REALLY,

11:41.071 --> 11:43.073
SO WE DON'T MIX UP YOUR PEE
WITH SOMEBODY ELSE'S.

11:43.073 --> 11:44.935
YOU HAVE MY PEE?

11:44.935 --> 11:46.737
YEAH. YOU WERE KINDA GIVING IT
AWAY FOR A WHILE THERE.

11:46.737 --> 11:48.238
(laughs) SPECTACULAR.

11:48.238 --> 11:49.910
(chuckles)

11:49.910 --> 11:51.311
NAME?

11:51.311 --> 11:53.243
LUCILLE.
OKAY.

11:53.243 --> 11:54.785
BALL.

11:54.785 --> 11:57.117
(laughs)

11:57.117 --> 11:58.718
YOU'RE A FUNNY LADY.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.951
WELL, THAT'S HOW
I MAKE MY LIVING.

12:00.951 --> 12:02.923
ALL RIGHT, MS. BALL.

12:02.923 --> 12:04.724
WE ARE GONNA GET YOU
WORKED UP

12:04.724 --> 12:07.798
AND SEND YOU ON YOUR WAY.

12:07.798 --> 12:09.259
HEY, WHERE AM I?

12:09.259 --> 12:11.932
UH, SEATTLE GRACE HOSPITAL.

12:11.932 --> 12:13.463
(chuckles)

12:13.463 --> 12:15.966
OH, GOD.

12:15.966 --> 12:17.737
AAH!

12:17.737 --> 12:18.738
DON'T PUSH.

12:18.738 --> 12:19.910
AAH!

12:19.910 --> 12:21.141
THERESA, DON'T PUSH.

12:21.141 --> 12:22.843
AAH!
KEPNER, WHAT'S HAPPENING?

12:22.843 --> 12:25.145
SHE'S DILATED AND EFFACED.
THE BABY STARTED CROWNING

12:25.145 --> 12:26.316
AND THEN JUST STOPPED.

12:26.316 --> 12:27.477
OKAY, MOVE.

12:27.477 --> 12:28.819
AAH!

12:28.819 --> 12:30.320
THERESA, YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

12:30.320 --> 12:31.882
AAH!

12:31.882 --> 12:33.954
OH.

12:33.954 --> 12:35.325
OHH!

12:35.325 --> 12:37.828
OKAY, KEPNER, ORDER UP
A 3-D ULTRASOUND, STAT,

12:37.828 --> 12:39.830
AND PREP AN O.R.
FOR A CRASH C-SECTION.

12:39.830 --> 12:42.332
AND PAGE MY HUSBAND.
(April) RIGHT AWAY.

12:42.332 --> 12:44.464
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

12:44.464 --> 12:45.966
WHAT HAPPENED?

12:45.966 --> 12:47.798
HE DETACHED THE CONNECTOR
TO THE ARTIFICIAL LUNG,

12:47.798 --> 12:48.768
AND I HAD TO
CLAMP OFF THE CANNULA

12:48.768 --> 12:49.940
TO STOP THE BLEEDING.

12:49.940 --> 12:51.441
I TOLD YOU THIS WAS
A BAD IDEA.

12:51.441 --> 12:53.143
ALL RIGHT. LET'S BOOK AN O.R.
LET'S GET IT HOOKED BACK UP.

12:53.143 --> 12:54.805
NO, IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.
HE HAS TO GO BACK ON ECMO.

12:54.805 --> 12:55.946
I-IT'S NOT WORKING,
SO HE'S WORSE?

12:55.946 --> 12:57.177
HOLD ON.
EVERYBODY, STOP.

12:57.177 --> 12:58.448
LOOK AT HIS SATs.

12:58.448 --> 13:01.511
93?
HE'S NEVER BEEN ABOVE 79.

13:01.511 --> 13:02.913
HIS RESPIRATORY RATE'S GOOD

13:02.913 --> 13:05.455
RILEY, I-IS IT HARD FOR YOU
TO BREATHE AT ALL?

13:05.455 --> 13:06.917
NO, I CAN BREATHE.

13:06.917 --> 13:08.188
OKAY, HOLD ON.

13:08.188 --> 13:10.790
YOU BLOW IN THIS, OKAY?

13:10.790 --> 13:12.022
(beeping continues)

13:12.022 --> 13:13.964
OH.
WOW.

13:13.964 --> 13:14.965
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

13:14.965 --> 13:16.126
HE'S BREATHING
BETTER THAN HE SHOULD BE.

13:16.126 --> 13:17.397
HE'S BREATHING BETTER
THAN HE EVER HAS.

13:17.397 --> 13:19.970
SO HE CAN USE IT
UNTIL HE GETS THE TRANSPLANT?

13:19.970 --> 13:21.371
WE NEED TO RUN MORE TESTS,
BUT...

13:21.371 --> 13:23.073
FROM THE SOUND OF HIS LUNGS,

13:23.073 --> 13:25.375
IT'S POSSIBLE HE MAY NOT
EVEN NEED A TRANSPLANT.

13:25.375 --> 13:26.977
(chuckles)

13:26.977 --> 13:28.308
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
WELL, YOU KNOW, WE HAVE TO--

13:28.308 --> 13:29.840
ARE YOU SERIOUS?!
WE HAVE TO SEE
THE TESTS, BUT--

13:29.840 --> 13:30.810
OH, THANK YOU! OH!

13:30.810 --> 13:32.913
I LOVE YOU! I LOVE YOU!

13:32.913 --> 13:33.884
I THINK I DO, TOO.

13:33.884 --> 13:36.216
(laughs) OH.

13:36.216 --> 13:38.248
(both laugh)

13:38.248 --> 13:40.090
OKAY.

13:40.090 --> 13:41.922
WAIT. WHAT?

13:41.922 --> 13:44.124
BUT WHY? WHY CAN'T YOU
DO THE SURGERY?

13:44.124 --> 13:46.897
UH, THE CHIEF OF SURGERY,
ELLIS GREY,

13:46.897 --> 13:49.829
WILL BE DOING THE--IT.

13:49.829 --> 13:51.101
UH, I MEAN, I CAN.

13:51.101 --> 13:53.133
I WOULD. SHE JUST...

13:53.133 --> 13:55.465
THERE'S PROTOCOLS,
AND SHE--

13:55.465 --> 13:58.038
(sighs) THINK OF IT
AS A HUGE UPGRADE.

13:58.038 --> 14:00.040
YOU JUST GOT HANDED
THE KEYS TO A JAGUAR

14:00.040 --> 14:02.512
AND YOU'VE BEEN DRIVING,
LIKE, A CIVIC.

14:02.512 --> 14:03.874
(elevator bell dings)

14:03.874 --> 14:05.315
A GOOD CAR.
A SOLID, DEPENDABLE CAR.

14:05.315 --> 14:06.376
BUT DR. GREY--

14:06.376 --> 14:07.918
HELLO, ALEX.

14:07.918 --> 14:10.420
MR. TAYLOR, MRS. TAYLOR,
I'M DR. GREY.

14:10.420 --> 14:13.153
I'LL BE DOING YOUR
PANCREATICODUODENECTOMY TODAY.

14:13.153 --> 14:16.056
I'LL GRAFT WITH A SECTION
OF YOUR INTERNAL ILIAC VEIN--

14:16.056 --> 14:17.857
A NEW TECHNIQUE
OF MY INVENTION.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.559
BY FORGOING THE USE
OF THE JUGULAR,

14:19.559 --> 14:21.491
YOU'LL HAVE NO VISIBLE SCARING
ON THE NECK.

14:21.491 --> 14:22.993
OH, WELL, THAT'S NICE--

14:22.993 --> 14:25.335
I'LL GLADLY HAVE YOU
SIGN THESE CONSENT FORMS.

14:25.335 --> 14:27.197
IT'S A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.
I'LL SEE YOU AFTER WE'RE DONE.

14:27.197 --> 14:28.368
(whispers) JAGUAR.

14:28.368 --> 14:29.599
(normal voice) DOC--
DR. GREY.

14:29.599 --> 14:31.942
ANY CHANCE I COULD
SCRUB IN WITH YOU?

14:31.942 --> 14:35.875
ALEX, OF COURSE.
LOVE TO HAVE YOU.

14:35.875 --> 14:36.947
SEE?

14:36.947 --> 14:39.109
YOU HAVE TO SPEAK UP
FOR YOURSELF.

14:39.109 --> 14:41.081
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

14:41.081 --> 14:43.914
C-CAN YOU EXPLAIN ANYTHING
THAT WOMAN JUST SAID?

14:43.914 --> 14:44.884
(elevator bell dings)

14:44.884 --> 14:46.116
YOU KNOW, I-I, UH,

14:46.116 --> 14:48.418
EXCUSE ME.

14:48.418 --> 14:50.060
UH...

14:50.060 --> 14:51.291
HERE YOU GO, SIR.

14:51.291 --> 14:53.293
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

14:53.293 --> 14:55.125
(people speaking indistinctly)

14:55.125 --> 14:57.127
YOUR HEART STOPPED AGAIN.

14:57.127 --> 14:59.129
BECAUSE OF ALL THE COCAINE
YOU'VE ENJOYED,

14:59.129 --> 15:01.031
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED
A SURGICAL IMPLANT--

15:01.031 --> 15:02.332
AN A.I.C.D. PACEMAKER.

15:02.332 --> 15:04.975
IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS
ABOUT THIS PROCEDURE,

15:04.975 --> 15:07.307
HERE'S
AN INFORMATIVE BROCHURE.

15:07.307 --> 15:09.679
(beeping continues)

15:09.679 --> 15:11.441
SHE'S A RAY OF SUNSHINE.

15:11.441 --> 15:14.084
SHE IS.

15:14.084 --> 15:15.545
I'M GONNA
GO OUT ON A LIMB

15:15.545 --> 15:17.617
AND ASSUME THAT YOU DON'T
HAVE ANY INSURANCE.

15:17.617 --> 15:19.049
SO IS THERE SOMEBODY
MAYBE I CAN CALL--

15:19.049 --> 15:21.051
PARENTS, SOMEBODY?

15:21.051 --> 15:22.953
NO. PARENTS ARE DEAD.

15:22.953 --> 15:24.094
I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

15:24.094 --> 15:25.595
IS IT FROM DISEASE,
FAMILY HISTORY?

15:25.595 --> 15:27.097

YES. SHE KNOWS
WHAT SHE'S DOING.

23:35.745 --> 23:36.786
WELL, JUST TELL HER.

23:36.786 --> 23:39.188
(door hisses open)

23:39.188 --> 23:40.620
(Jackson) YANG, WAIT.

23:40.620 --> 23:42.622
WHEN IN THE HELL ARE YOU GONNA
GIVE LUCILLE BALL HER A.I.C.D.?

23:42.622 --> 23:44.123
YOU HAVE TO DO IT.
I'VE GOT SURGERY.

23:44.123 --> 23:45.655
I DON'T THINK SO.
YOU DID THE CONSULT.

23:45.655 --> 23:46.756
WHERE'S YOUR WIFE?
WHAT?

23:46.756 --> 23:47.997
SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO PLACE
A PACEMAKER IN OUR O.D. GIRL

23:47.997 --> 23:49.559
HOURS AGO...
HEY.

23:49.559 --> 23:50.800
AND NOW SHE'S TRYING
TO PAWN IT OFF ON ME.
HEY.

23:50.800 --> 23:51.761
I HAVE A SURGERY.

23:51.761 --> 23:53.202
YOU'RE THE CARDIO CONSULT.
YOU DO IT.

23:53.202 --> 23:54.564
AVERY CAN DO IT.

23:54.564 --> 23:55.735
I CAN'T SPARE AVERY.

23:55.735 --> 23:56.706
I'M NOT GIVING UP
THIS SURGERY

23:56.706 --> 23:58.167
TO STICK A PACEMAKER
IN A JUNKIE.

23:58.167 --> 23:59.669
TELL YOUR WIFE TO HAVE
MEREDITH WEBBER--

23:59.669 --> 24:01.210
YANG, JUST BACK OFF!

24:01.210 --> 24:03.513
(bystanders gasp)

24:04.944 --> 24:08.077
(indistinct conversations)

24:12.582 --> 24:16.686
(indistinct conversations
continue)

24:16.686 --> 24:18.057
(panting)

24:18.057 --> 24:20.089
(exhales deeply)

24:20.089 --> 24:23.092
(people speaking indistinctly)

24:24.734 --> 24:26.936
I'M SORRY. I JUST...

24:26.936 --> 24:29.869
I JUST GOT REALLY...
(sighs)

24:29.869 --> 24:33.072
WELL,
YOU WON'T NEED STITCHES...

24:33.072 --> 24:35.474
THIS TIME.

24:35.474 --> 24:37.106
I THOUGHT IT WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE GETTING BETTER.

24:37.106 --> 24:38.848
OR ARE YOU GONNA HIT
ANOTHER INTERN?

24:38.848 --> 24:41.811
NO.

24:41.811 --> 24:42.952
(sighs) WHY DO YOU
KEEP HELPING ME?

24:42.952 --> 24:46.616
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
REPORT ME?

24:50.489 --> 24:52.962
BECAUSE I'M A DOCTOR.

24:54.924 --> 24:57.166
PLEASE DON'T TELL MY WIFE.

24:59.799 --> 25:01.500
WELL, YOU CAN FINISH
THE REST OF THIS.

25:01.500 --> 25:03.132
I HAVE SURGERY.

25:04.233 --> 25:05.635
(door opens)

25:05.635 --> 25:07.036
(indistinct conversations)

25:07.036 --> 25:08.578
(camera shutter clicks)

25:08.578 --> 25:09.879
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

25:09.879 --> 25:11.010
(Ellis) SUCTION HERE.

25:11.010 --> 25:12.542
(suction gurgles)

25:12.542 --> 25:14.544
SO JUNE SOUNDS GOOD.
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT WHERE?

25:14.544 --> 25:17.617
OH, M-MEREDITH AND I
THOUGHT ABOUT, UH, HAWAII.

25:17.617 --> 25:18.788
THAT MIGHT BE COOL.

25:18.788 --> 25:20.149
YOU KNOW, HAVE EVERYONE
COME OUT AND--

25:20.149 --> 25:21.821
REALLY,
A DESTINATION WEDDING?

25:21.821 --> 25:24.123
(laughs) ALEX,
I'M RUNNING A HOSPITAL.

25:24.123 --> 25:26.756
I CAN'T JUST DASH OFF
TO--

25:26.756 --> 25:28.728
RETRACT THAT, PLEASE.
CLAMP.

25:28.728 --> 25:30.730
YOU'LL DO IT HERE.
I'LL BOOK THE RAINIER CLUB.

25:30.730 --> 25:31.901
IT'S GORGEOUS.

25:31.901 --> 25:33.933
(chuckles)
THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

25:33.933 --> 25:35.104
(suction gurgling)

25:35.104 --> 25:36.866
WHAT THE HELL
AM I LOOKING AT?

25:36.866 --> 25:39.739
THE ILIAC VEINS
ARE COMPLETELY THROMBOSED,

25:39.739 --> 25:41.040
BOTH OF THEM.

25:41.040 --> 25:43.873
UNUSABLE.
COMPLETELY UNUSABLE.

25:43.873 --> 25:46.015
DID YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS?

25:46.015 --> 25:47.546
UH, NO.

25:47.546 --> 25:49.619
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

25:49.619 --> 25:51.821
OKAY.
CHANGE OF PLANS.

25:51.821 --> 25:53.322
WE'LL USE THE RENAL VEIN.

25:53.322 --> 25:54.854
DAMN IT.

25:54.854 --> 25:57.727
SOMEONE PAGE DR. BAILEY,
PLEASE.

25:57.727 --> 25:59.829
I WANT HER IN HERE NOW.

25:59.829 --> 26:02.031
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

26:02.031 --> 26:03.733
WHY AREN'T YOU DOING
A TEVAR?

26:03.733 --> 26:05.034
I'M DOING A DIRECT APPROACH.
IT'S COOLER.

26:05.034 --> 26:06.766
A TEVAR IS SAFER.
IT'S FAR LESS INVASIVE.

26:06.766 --> 26:08.097
YOU GO IN THROUGH
THE FEMORAL,

26:08.097 --> 26:09.799
YOU DON'T HAVE TO CRACK
THE CHEST.

26:09.799 --> 26:11.100
I ALREADY ORDERED
THE GRAFT.

26:11.100 --> 26:14.043
YOU TWO MIGHT HAVE WORKED OUT
YOUR SURGICAL PLAN BEFORE THIS.

26:14.043 --> 26:17.006
I DID, AND MY SURGICAL PLAN
DIDN'T INCLUDE THIS NIMROD.

26:17.006 --> 26:18.708
NO, IT JUST INCLUDED
HACKING UP THE PATIENT

26:18.708 --> 26:19.949
LIKE A PSYCHOPATH.

26:19.949 --> 26:21.651
GIRLS, DON'T MAKE ME COME
OVER THERE AND DO IT MYSELF.

26:21.651 --> 26:23.112
SHUT UP AND WORK.

26:23.112 --> 26:24.914
(Cristina and Meredith)
10-BLADE.

26:24.914 --> 26:26.085
AVERY.

26:26.085 --> 26:27.286
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

26:27.286 --> 26:29.889
I'M, UM, BOOKING AN O.R.

26:29.889 --> 26:31.921
I'M GONNA TAKE MY--THAT GIRL
UP FOR HER PACEMAKER.

26:31.921 --> 26:32.892
WHY?

26:32.892 --> 26:34.223
SOMEBODY MADE OFF WITH
AN ARMLOAD OF DRUGS

26:34.223 --> 26:36.696
FROM THE DISPENSARY--
CODEINE, MORPHINE, DEMEROL.

26:36.696 --> 26:37.967
OKAY, WHY--

26:37.967 --> 26:39.669
'CAUSE THE DISPENSARY
WAS ACCESSED

26:39.669 --> 26:40.900
WITH YOUR I.D. CARD.

26:40.900 --> 26:42.601
THAT'S WHY.

26:42.601 --> 26:45.635
OH, DAMN IT.

26:48.808 --> 26:50.980
(people speaking indistinctly)

26:50.980 --> 26:52.682
BUT YOU KNEW THE PATIENT
HAD THROMBOSIS?

26:52.682 --> 26:54.714
I...
(suction gurgling)

26:54.714 --> 26:56.716
(lowered voice) I HAD... I DID.
(Ellis) SPEAK UP.

26:56.716 --> 26:58.617
IN THE LEGS... YES.

26:58.617 --> 27:00.950
UM, DID YOU LOOK
AT HIS CHART?

27:00.950 --> 27:02.121
OF COURSE I LOOKED
AT HIS CHART.

27:02.121 --> 27:03.322
BUT THERE WAS NO INDICATION

27:03.322 --> 27:04.694
THAT THE THROMBOSIS
WAS THIS BAD.

27:04.694 --> 27:05.855
WHY WASN'T IT IN HIS CHART?

27:05.855 --> 27:08.257
BECAUSE I HAD CHOSEN

27:08.257 --> 27:10.359
TO USE THE JUGULAR.

27:10.359 --> 27:13.002
THEY WERE
IN THE MEDICAL RECORDS.

27:13.002 --> 27:14.834
AND YOU DIDN'T TELL ME

27:14.834 --> 27:16.966
BECAUSE I'D OPTED
TO NOT CUT THE MAN'S THROAT?

27:16.966 --> 27:18.337
WELL, THAT'S...
IT'S A GOOD PLAN--

27:18.337 --> 27:19.839
BUT I ENDED UP CUTTING
HIS THROAT ANYWAY.

27:19.839 --> 27:21.340
MY PROCEDURE'S A WASH,

27:21.340 --> 27:24.213
AND THE PATIENT'S BEEN UNDER
FAR LONGER THAN IS OPTIMAL.

27:24.213 --> 27:27.847
THAT'S WHY
I PICKED THE JUGULAR.

27:27.847 --> 27:30.019
IS THAT RIGHT...
(whispers) DR. BAILEY?

27:30.019 --> 27:33.382
IS THAT WHY YOU PICKED IT?

27:33.382 --> 27:34.754
(normal voice)
ALEX, WHERE'S MY GRAFT?

27:34.754 --> 27:37.056
HERE'S THE GRAFT.

27:37.056 --> 27:39.729
I'M JUST SUTURING.

27:39.729 --> 27:40.890
WHOA.

27:40.890 --> 27:43.332
OH, MY GOD.

27:43.332 --> 27:46.035
I MIGHT HAVE NICKED
THE CAROTID.

27:46.035 --> 27:48.337
YOU PEOPLE
ARE TRYING TO KILL ME.

27:48.337 --> 27:52.772
(reporters
speaking indistinctly)

27:52.772 --> 27:54.403
DID YOU GET
THE WHOLE TUMOR?

27:54.403 --> 27:55.775
I TOLD YOU.

27:55.775 --> 27:57.747
I'M NOT ASKING FOR MYSELF.

27:57.747 --> 27:59.108
I'M ASKING WHAT I SHOULD
TELL THE MOTHER--

27:59.108 --> 28:01.911
JUST GO.
I WILL TALK TO HER MYSELF.

28:01.911 --> 28:04.083
SO WE'LL TALK ABOUT
THE PRESCHOOL--

28:04.083 --> 28:05.314
IT'S GONNA BE LATE.

28:05.314 --> 28:07.817
I'M GONNA STAY AND LOOK INTO
THIS CLINICAL TRIAL.

28:07.817 --> 28:08.918
THAT'S GREAT.

28:08.918 --> 28:11.320
ONE MORE REASON FOR YOU
TO STAY OUT OF THE HOUSE.

28:11.320 --> 28:13.022
(foot pedal clanks)

28:13.022 --> 28:15.795
THAT'S FINE.

28:15.795 --> 28:18.297
IT'S FINE. MAYBE YOU'LL BE MORE
INTERESTED ONCE THE BABY COMES.
RIGHT.

28:18.297 --> 28:19.969
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE DIFFERENT
WHEN THE BABY COMES.

28:19.969 --> 28:21.801
WELL, A GIRL CAN HOPE.
NOTHING'S GONNA CHANGE.

28:21.801 --> 28:23.072
WHAT DO YOU THINK
IS GONNA CHANGE?

28:23.072 --> 28:24.373
DO YOU EVEN WANT A BABY?
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

28:24.373 --> 28:26.175
I'M NOT TA--
YES, I WANT A BABY.

28:26.175 --> 28:29.939
NO, I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT
A BABY. THIS BABY, WITH ME.

28:32.411 --> 28:33.913
DO YOU LOVE ME?

28:38.047 --> 28:39.849
DO YOU?

28:39.849 --> 28:42.852
OF COURSE I LOVE YOU.

28:42.852 --> 28:45.354
CAN YOU SAY IT
WITHOUT LOOKING AT THE FLOOR?

28:45.354 --> 28:46.896
(clears throat)

28:46.896 --> 28:49.028
(chuckles)

28:51.500 --> 28:53.302
(door opens)

29:00.970 --> 29:03.112
LESS THAN THREE MINUTES
OF CIRCULATORY ARREST LEFT.

29:03.112 --> 29:04.814
YOU GO OVER THAT,
AND THE ORGANS START DYING.

29:04.814 --> 29:06.075
IF WEBBER
HADN'T TAKEN SO LONG...

29:06.075 --> 29:07.947
I TOOK THE TIME IT NEEDED.
TWO MINUTES.

29:07.947 --> 29:09.819
DONE. GO BACK ON BYPASS.
(woman) YES, DOCTOR.

29:09.819 --> 29:11.881
OH, GOT A LEAK.

29:11.881 --> 29:13.222
OKAY, I'LL FIND IT.
I'LL THROW A STITCH.

29:13.222 --> 29:14.523
NO, IT'S TOO RISKY.
THE LEAK IS BEHIND THE HEART.

29:14.523 --> 29:15.885
YOU NEED TO DO
AN INTERNAL GRAFT.

29:15.885 --> 29:17.226
WILL YOU SHUT UP?
I WILL FIND IT.

29:17.226 --> 29:18.287
DR. TORRES?

29:18.287 --> 29:21.190
WEBBER'S RIGHT, YANG.

29:21.190 --> 29:23.132
HER WAY IS SAFER.
LET HER DO IT.

29:23.132 --> 29:25.364
5-0 PROLENE.

29:25.364 --> 29:27.236
MOVE YOUR HANDS.

29:27.236 --> 29:28.938
MOVE YOUR HANDS, PLEASE.

29:28.938 --> 29:31.941
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

29:34.143 --> 29:35.304
OH--

29:35.304 --> 29:37.106
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
MOVE YOUR HANDS.

29:37.106 --> 29:39.148
I GOT IT.
I FOUND THE LEAK.

29:39.148 --> 29:41.180
UH, GIVE ME A CLAMP.
2-0 PROLENE. I GOT IT.

29:42.982 --> 29:45.154
(indistinct conversations)

29:45.154 --> 29:46.816
HAVE YOU SEEN MY WIFE?

29:46.816 --> 29:48.157
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I HAVE.

29:48.157 --> 29:50.019
SHE JUST THREATENED
TO QUIT.

29:50.019 --> 29:51.190
DO ME A FAVOR.

29:51.190 --> 29:52.892
WASH YOUR LAUNDRY AT HOME,
NOT IN MY O.R.

29:52.892 --> 29:54.193
WELL, OH, THERE'S TWO SIDES
TO EVERY STORY--

29:54.193 --> 29:55.895
YEAH, I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN YOUR SIDE.

29:55.895 --> 29:58.227
DEREK, RICHARD AND I HAD
VERY HIGH HOPES FOR YOU,

29:58.227 --> 29:59.528
BUT YOU HAVE BEEN NOTHING
BUT A DISAPPOINTMENT.

29:59.528 --> 30:01.130
YOU DON'T PUBLISH,
YOU DON'T TEACH,

30:01.130 --> 30:02.301
YOUR ATTITUDE IS TERRIBLE.

30:02.301 --> 30:03.432
THE RESIDENTS HAVE
A NICKNAME FOR YOU,

30:03.432 --> 30:05.034
AND IT IS NOT FLATTERING.

30:05.034 --> 30:06.275
WHAT DO THEY CALL ME?

30:06.275 --> 30:07.907
GET IT TOGETHER,

30:07.907 --> 30:09.909
BECAUSE IF IT COMES DOWN TO
A CHOICE BETWEEN YOU AND HER,

30:09.909 --> 30:12.411
YOU NEED TO BE VERY CLEAR
WHICH ONE OF YOU I WILL CHOOSE.

30:12.411 --> 30:15.414
(indistinct conversations
continue)

30:15.414 --> 30:18.087
(woman speaks indistinctly
over p.a.)

30:18.087 --> 30:21.991
TRUST ME, YOU TWO DON'T
WANT TO BE THE NEXT SHEPHERDS.

30:21.991 --> 30:23.292
SO I START TO DO
THE REPAIR--

30:23.292 --> 30:25.224
AND SHE JUST STUCK
HER HAND IN?
YES!

30:25.224 --> 30:27.426
WAIT. WHAT HAPPENED?
YANG'S A FREAKIN' MANIAC.

30:27.426 --> 30:29.298
SHE'S DANGEROUS.

30:31.430 --> 30:33.132
MY PATIENT'S FINE.

30:33.132 --> 30:35.334
AWAKE, GREAT VITALS,
IF YOU WERE INTERESTED.

30:35.334 --> 30:37.406
WELL, THAT'S GREAT,
'CAUSE O.D. GIRL BOLTED.

30:37.406 --> 30:41.040
YOU HAD NO BUSINESS
SHOVING IN THERE.

30:41.040 --> 30:43.042
YOU HAD NO BUSINESS
IN THAT O.R.

30:43.042 --> 30:44.373
I WASN'T ABOUT TO LET
THAT GUY DIE

30:44.373 --> 30:45.614
WATCHING YOU JACK AROUND
WITH THE INTERNAL GRAFT.

30:45.614 --> 30:47.276
THAT WAS THE RIGHT TECHNIQUE.

30:47.276 --> 30:48.847
DR. TORRES SPECIFICALLY--

30:48.847 --> 30:50.349
DR. TORRES
ONLY SIDED WITH YOU

30:50.349 --> 30:51.850
BECAUSE YOU'RE
THE CHIEF'S LITTLE GIRL.

30:51.850 --> 30:54.253
SHE'S A PATHETIC LACKEY.

30:54.253 --> 30:57.927
WELL, WE'D ALL BE WORKING UNDER
DR. PRESTON BURKE RIGHT NOW,

30:57.927 --> 31:01.130
BUT YOU SCREWED US OUT OF
THAT OPPORTUNITY, LITERALLY.

31:01.130 --> 31:03.262
WHAT EXACTLY
DID YOU DO TO HIM?

31:03.262 --> 31:05.534
BECAUSE HE LEFT THE STATE
TO GET AWAY FROM YOU.

31:05.534 --> 31:07.066
GOOD ONE.

31:07.066 --> 31:08.297
IF YOU WANT TO GET PERSONAL,

31:08.297 --> 31:09.868
WHY DON'T YOU ASK
PRINCE CHARMING

31:09.868 --> 31:12.401
WHAT HE AND THE VIRGIN MARY
LIKE TO DO IN HIS OFFICE?
WHAT?

31:12.401 --> 31:15.574
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

31:15.574 --> 31:18.047
WHAT...

31:18.047 --> 31:19.348
SHE'S A LUNATIC.
WHAT--WHAT--WHAT IS SHE
TALKING ABOUT?

31:19.348 --> 31:21.050
YOU CAN'T BELIEVE
A WORD SHE SAYS.

31:21.050 --> 31:22.952
SHE'S JUST... COME ON!

31:22.952 --> 31:24.413
APRIL?

31:24.413 --> 31:25.384
(crying) I'M...

31:25.384 --> 31:27.256
I'M SORRY. I'M S--

31:27.256 --> 31:30.119
I'M SORRY. I...

31:30.119 --> 31:31.290
OH, GOD.

31:31.290 --> 31:32.591
OH, JUST SHOOT ME NOW.

31:32.591 --> 31:34.093
(door closes)

31:34.093 --> 31:36.125
OH, GOD.

31:36.125 --> 31:38.427
(door opens)

31:38.427 --> 31:40.299
(door closes)
