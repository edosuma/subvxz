06:04.488 --> 06:05.621
Got it?

06:05.689 --> 06:06.856
What took you so long?

06:06.923 --> 06:08.658
I stopped to get some extra liquor.

06:08.726 --> 06:10.760
You should've let me know.

06:10.828 --> 06:13.462
I didn't know I was supposed to be on call.

06:13.530 --> 06:16.632
You're always supposed to be on call.

06:16.700 --> 06:20.302
Sorry, Ms. Fryser.

06:20.370 --> 06:22.671
That's all right, sweetheart.

06:22.673 --> 06:24.892
You're so terrific in the sack

06:24.960 --> 06:27.361
that it almost justifies
the excessive salary

06:27.428 --> 06:29.096
that I have to pay you.

06:47.449 --> 06:49.851
By the way, captain...

06:49.918 --> 06:52.387
Try and give us the smoothest
possible trip, will you?

06:52.454 --> 06:53.855
We don't want any of our

06:53.923 --> 06:56.057
prospective buyers getting seasick.

06:56.125 --> 06:57.125
Yes, ma'am.

06:57.126 --> 07:02.196
Sick people do not buy property.

07:02.264 --> 07:05.635
I'll cut between the waves.

07:05.702 --> 07:09.505
You do that.

07:09.573 --> 07:10.940
I'm sure you remember, by the way,

07:11.008 --> 07:12.575
that I'm paying you damn good money

07:12.643 --> 07:15.528
to rent this boat, captain.

07:15.595 --> 07:18.822
I'm sure that if I forget,
you'll remind me.

07:22.368 --> 07:24.604
Oh, well, it looks like our guests

07:24.672 --> 07:28.608
are finally arriving.

07:28.676 --> 07:30.877
Sure a nice boat, isn't it?

07:35.516 --> 07:40.053
We went on a bigger one
to Mexico that time.

07:40.120 --> 07:42.925
Yeah, but we paid for that trip.

07:47.295 --> 07:50.965
Two-bit cruise down the coast to
look at overpriced swampland.

07:51.032 --> 07:53.267
You always said you wanted
a home on the ocean.

07:53.335 --> 07:55.436
Yeah, I said a lot of things.

08:05.966 --> 08:07.086
You coming?

08:07.133 --> 08:10.402
Yeah, yeah, all right.

08:10.470 --> 08:13.505
You win. We'll go for a boat ride.

08:22.465 --> 08:27.821
Here's a $10. Keep the change.

08:27.888 --> 08:32.073
But, lady, the fare's $9.80.

08:32.142 --> 08:33.775
don't mention it.

08:49.344 --> 08:50.577
What are you doing?

08:50.646 --> 08:52.246
The letter said everything was free.

08:52.313 --> 08:55.783
I'm writing down all our expenses
so we can be reimbursed.

09:15.104 --> 09:16.605
Umm...

09:16.673 --> 09:19.508
Before I board your ship,
may I ask you a question?

09:19.575 --> 09:21.176
Yes, ma'am.

09:21.243 --> 09:23.745
I just want to make certain
that I'm under no obligation

09:23.813 --> 09:27.317
to buy any of your property,
in case I change my mind.

09:27.384 --> 09:28.584
It's not my property, lady.

09:28.652 --> 09:32.522
I just get you there and get you back.

09:32.589 --> 09:33.923
Thank you.

09:33.990 --> 09:36.559
Let's get this circus on the road.

09:36.627 --> 09:38.494
Hi. Are you Ms. Ellis? Yes.

09:38.562 --> 09:41.698
I'm Marilyn Fryser, I'm the
president of Dreamland Shores.

09:41.765 --> 09:44.600
Come and meet some people. This is Mr.
and Mrs. Lawson.

09:44.668 --> 09:45.835
Hello.

09:45.902 --> 09:48.839
And this is Larry Graham.

09:48.906 --> 09:51.408
I think we have everybody on-board now.

10:33.920 --> 10:35.621
Think that'll please the bitch?

10:35.689 --> 10:37.390
Ever see anything that did?

10:37.457 --> 10:39.124
What a rip-off.

10:39.192 --> 10:41.293
She'll bring a boatload of slobs down here

10:41.361 --> 10:45.197
and convince them it's paradise.

10:45.265 --> 10:48.368
It wouldn't be so bad around here
if it was close to something.

10:48.436 --> 10:50.203
A road, a town, anything.

10:50.271 --> 10:52.071
What about diamond Springs?

10:52.139 --> 10:53.707
Sure, that's practically next door.

10:53.775 --> 10:55.776
All you do is walk 2 miles to the river

10:55.843 --> 10:57.878
and swim upstream another 10.

10:57.945 --> 11:00.414
You ought to read the
contract she makes them sign.

11:00.481 --> 11:02.048
The jerks that buy this swampland

11:02.116 --> 11:04.217
can't even sell it for 2 years.

11:04.285 --> 11:07.186
Dreamland shores won't be here in 2 years.

11:24.956 --> 11:27.392
Why don't you try some of
the meatballs over there?

11:27.459 --> 11:32.998
They are really tasty.

11:33.065 --> 11:34.767
Are you ladies having a good time?

11:34.834 --> 11:35.967
Lovely.

11:36.035 --> 11:38.236
Just marvelous, thank you.

11:38.304 --> 11:40.906
It'd be wonderful. Everything is so fresh.

11:40.973 --> 11:42.307
It's unbelievable.

11:42.375 --> 11:43.742
Everything all right here?

11:43.810 --> 11:46.812
It's great.

11:46.880 --> 11:48.881
You won't believe how difficult it was

11:48.948 --> 11:51.350
for me to convince Larry
to come this weekend.

11:51.419 --> 11:53.052
Mr. Thompson? Yes.

11:53.120 --> 11:54.754
Have you taken some good pictures?

11:54.822 --> 11:58.491
I think I have some dandies.

11:58.559 --> 12:00.693
Excuse me.

12:00.761 --> 12:03.129
Where are those 2 guys that you hired?

12:03.196 --> 12:05.598
I suppose they finished
their work and they left.

12:05.666 --> 12:07.133
Left?

12:07.200 --> 12:10.337
Well, you can tell them that they're fired.

12:10.405 --> 12:13.073
Speaking of that, why don't
you try a little of that

12:13.141 --> 12:16.844
old-world charm that you're
so famous for on our guests?

12:16.912 --> 12:19.362
I'm not running a charity organization.

12:24.252 --> 12:26.269
I've always wanted to live near the water.

12:26.338 --> 12:27.805
It's beautiful here, isn't it?

12:27.872 --> 12:29.540
Yes, it is lovely.

12:55.034 --> 12:57.737
How are you doing?

12:57.804 --> 12:59.805
Fine. Charlie, right?

12:59.873 --> 13:01.374
Right.

13:01.441 --> 13:03.376
Good, Charlie.

13:03.443 --> 13:04.844
What are you doing?

13:04.911 --> 13:09.382
Trying to figure out what
everybody's doing here?

13:09.449 --> 13:11.050
Here to buy land. What else?

13:11.118 --> 13:12.753
Not everyone.

13:12.820 --> 13:14.554
Our average is 1 out of 3 people

13:14.622 --> 13:17.824
come along just for the ride.

13:17.892 --> 13:19.860
You should be more careful who you invite.

13:19.927 --> 13:21.828
We sure would like to,

13:21.896 --> 13:24.481
but we get stuck with that
statistic no matter what.

13:28.068 --> 13:30.970
What about this group?

13:31.039 --> 13:34.008
Think you can figure out who'll
be the buyers and who aren't?

13:34.075 --> 13:35.355
Not exactly.

13:35.377 --> 13:40.748
But I think I've got you figured out.

13:40.816 --> 13:42.383
Tell me.

13:42.451 --> 13:44.251
Not only could you not afford a lot,

13:44.319 --> 13:46.120
but I think you'd have a hell of a time

13:46.187 --> 13:49.524
swinging for the boat ride.

13:49.591 --> 13:53.929
Am I right?

13:53.996 --> 13:56.131
Cheers.

13:56.198 --> 13:57.215
Excuse me.

14:06.426 --> 14:08.260
Have you had enough?

14:08.327 --> 14:09.728
Enough what?

14:09.796 --> 14:11.496
Party bullshit.

14:11.565 --> 14:15.035
I know what you mean.

14:15.102 --> 14:20.040
Why don't we take a look around?
See if this place is for real.

14:20.107 --> 14:22.776
I don't think your wife would like that.

14:22.843 --> 14:26.780
Uh, we have different interests.

14:26.847 --> 14:29.082
I'm sure you do.

14:29.149 --> 14:30.836
How about it?

14:35.323 --> 14:37.658
Yes, Mr. Stratton is the vice president

14:37.726 --> 14:40.761
of international management consultants.

14:40.829 --> 14:43.731
I've worked for him about 20 years.

14:43.799 --> 14:46.634
His personal executive secretary,

14:46.702 --> 14:48.202
you understand.

14:48.269 --> 14:52.741
It's quite a responsibility.

14:52.809 --> 14:55.543
Cheap scotch. I think its all a come-on.

14:55.612 --> 14:57.679
So what? It's free, isn't it?

14:57.747 --> 15:02.584
That's what velma and I like the most.

15:02.652 --> 15:05.754
That's a long time to be with one company.

15:05.822 --> 15:08.624
Not when you consider all the
benefits that can accrue...

15:08.691 --> 15:11.192
Gifts, bonuses, retirement pension.

15:11.260 --> 15:14.229
No wonder you're looking
into land investments.

15:14.296 --> 15:18.001
I wouldn't say that I'm exactly
looking for investments.

15:18.068 --> 15:19.502
Now, don't you worry.

15:19.569 --> 15:21.938
Nobody is going to hustle
you into buying anything.

15:22.006 --> 15:25.004
Dreamland Shores sells itself.

15:28.445 --> 15:29.812
Mmph!

15:29.880 --> 15:31.581
That's not what we came out here for.

15:31.649 --> 15:33.949
Come on.

15:34.017 --> 15:37.720
I must be crazy or something.
I just met you an hour ago

15:37.788 --> 15:40.539
and here I am out in the
woods playing hot fingers.

15:40.607 --> 15:42.474
Loosen up.

15:42.542 --> 15:44.944
Let me go!

15:45.012 --> 15:47.313
Look, I just got out of one married man.

15:47.381 --> 15:50.583
Not with me.

15:50.651 --> 15:53.486
It'll be one of the big
disappointments in my life.

15:53.554 --> 15:55.739
Where you going?

15:55.807 --> 15:57.174
Let go!

15:57.241 --> 15:58.375
Come on.

15:58.442 --> 16:00.277
You know what it's all about, baby.

16:00.344 --> 16:02.896
Let me go, you son of a bitch!

16:02.964 --> 16:07.184
Relax, relax.

16:07.251 --> 16:09.586
That's it.

16:09.654 --> 16:11.789
I just want to get to know you, that's all.

16:11.856 --> 16:13.490
Ok.

16:18.781 --> 16:21.366
We're gonna be good friends. Aah!

16:21.434 --> 16:22.867
Shit!

16:22.935 --> 16:25.337
Ohh! Ohh!

16:33.312 --> 16:34.979
Excuse me.

16:35.047 --> 16:37.949
I was going to ask you if you'd
like to join the entertainment,

16:38.017 --> 16:40.384
but I see you found your own.

16:40.452 --> 16:44.555
Yeah, we were just looking around.

16:44.623 --> 16:47.871
Yeah, we were just looking around.

17:52.527 --> 17:55.184
If you're looking for the
party, it's right down there.

17:58.933 --> 18:03.360
I'm not much for parties.
Besides, I want to talk to you.

18:05.240 --> 18:07.508
It's Dan, isn't it?

18:07.576 --> 18:09.543
What do you want to talk about?

18:09.611 --> 18:13.147
Here. This place.

18:13.215 --> 18:14.615
Dreamland shores.

18:14.682 --> 18:17.017
Look, lady, I told you,
I'm just the boat driver.

18:17.085 --> 18:18.752
I get you here and I get you back.

18:18.820 --> 18:20.489
I don't sell the land, all right?

18:20.556 --> 18:22.924
Exactly, so you shouldn't
care one way or another.

18:22.992 --> 18:26.194
I don't. I don't give a damn.

18:26.262 --> 18:30.098
You see, I want to open a small business.

18:30.166 --> 18:35.337
Maybe an agency for domestic help.

18:35.404 --> 18:38.440
But it's going to take all
the savings I've got,

18:38.508 --> 18:39.941
so I've got to make certain

18:40.009 --> 18:42.611
that I make the best investment possible.

18:42.678 --> 18:44.812
I don't have any opinions about that.

18:44.880 --> 18:46.981
Well, but you'd be honest with me.

18:47.049 --> 18:49.417
Like, this land they're trying to sell us,

18:49.485 --> 18:54.223
is it a good thing?

18:54.291 --> 18:55.491
Or not?

18:55.559 --> 18:57.193
Lady, if you want advice,

18:57.261 --> 18:59.295
would you ask somebody else, please?

19:16.563 --> 19:19.679
I just had a pretty rough
time of it myself.

19:22.704 --> 19:26.573
And I guess if I weren't so
sick of the whole routine,

19:26.641 --> 19:29.677
I'd probably be doing what
you're doing right now.

19:29.744 --> 19:32.279
I beg your pardon?

19:32.347 --> 19:37.618
All this self-pity,
"nobody-gives-a-damn" attitude.

19:37.686 --> 19:39.520
What?

19:39.587 --> 19:43.223
The booze.

19:43.291 --> 19:44.458
Right.

19:50.097 --> 19:52.434
You know, umm when I met you on the boat,

19:52.501 --> 19:55.036
I didn't like you very much.

19:55.103 --> 19:58.139
That's not exactly a surprise.

19:58.207 --> 19:59.974
I don't know.

20:00.042 --> 20:03.611
I guess I thought you were one
of those macho, phony types,

20:03.679 --> 20:06.711
the kind whose brains fall out
every time he unzips his fly.

20:10.185 --> 20:15.690
Say, what is this, group therapy?

20:15.758 --> 20:17.859
Maybe.

20:17.926 --> 20:23.198
I can't afford to make
a mistake, that's all.

20:23.266 --> 20:25.100
I lied to them back there before.

20:25.168 --> 20:27.370
I told them I had a good job,

20:27.437 --> 20:33.041
been working for the same man for 20 years.

20:33.109 --> 20:36.278
The truth of it is, he fired me.

20:36.346 --> 20:40.769
All I've got is severance
pay and references.

20:44.120 --> 20:47.289
I've got a job that pays $30,000 a year,

20:47.357 --> 20:51.895
I own a 2-bedroom condominium,
I've got a $10,000 sports car,

20:51.963 --> 20:54.297
I've got a wife and I got a 4-year-old kid

20:54.365 --> 20:55.665
who thinks I'm god.

20:55.733 --> 20:57.033
How's that?

20:57.101 --> 21:00.536
That's terrific. That's fabulous.

21:00.604 --> 21:02.638
Look, I was just trying to tell you that

21:02.706 --> 21:04.908
I changed my mind about not liking you.

21:04.976 --> 21:08.879
That's all.

21:08.946 --> 21:11.748
Forget it.

21:11.815 --> 21:14.050
I'm a bad investment.

21:14.118 --> 21:17.921
And why do you say that?

21:17.989 --> 21:22.526
Because the...

21:22.594 --> 21:27.511
$30,000-a-year job went
in the toilet last year.

21:29.101 --> 21:33.170
And the sports car needs an overhaul.

21:33.238 --> 21:36.240
And my wife is an ex-wife,

21:36.308 --> 21:39.911
who's suing me for back support.

21:39.978 --> 21:45.133
My kid won't even talk to me on the phone.

21:45.200 --> 21:49.804
What about your condominium?

21:49.872 --> 21:52.374
Plastic,

21:52.441 --> 21:57.279
like everything else.

21:57.346 --> 21:58.380
Shall we?

21:58.447 --> 22:02.617
Ok.

22:02.686 --> 22:07.089
If it was my money and I was
going to buy this land,

22:07.157 --> 22:12.394
first, I'd make sure they struck oil on it,

22:12.461 --> 22:16.015
and then I'd still think twice.

22:16.082 --> 22:20.385
Does that answer your question?

22:20.453 --> 22:22.421
Ok.

22:22.489 --> 22:25.925
Dan.

22:25.993 --> 22:29.028
You got a button off your shirt.

22:29.196 --> 22:32.838
If you got time, I always
carry a needle and thread.

22:35.703 --> 22:37.671
I don't need any buttons.

22:58.293 --> 23:00.727
This building here is gonna be torn down.

23:00.795 --> 23:02.763
And the dreamland shores beach club

23:02.830 --> 23:04.831
is gonna be constructed in its place.

23:04.899 --> 23:07.768
It'll be the most beautiful
and modern club imaginable,

23:07.835 --> 23:09.770
with every possible convenience.

23:09.837 --> 23:12.373
If we all get into the tram,
now, where Charlie is,

23:12.440 --> 23:15.108
we'll be off on our little tour.

23:21.716 --> 23:23.084
Here we go.

23:28.591 --> 23:29.824
<i>NOW, DON'T FORGET,</i>

23:29.892 --> 23:32.394
<i>IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT ANYTHING,</i>

23:32.461 --> 23:33.828
<i>JUST SHOUT THEM OUT.</i>

23:33.896 --> 23:35.129
<i>WE'RE VERY INFORMAL HERE</i>

23:35.198 --> 23:37.599
<i>AND THIS TOUR IS STRICTLY
FOR YOUR PLEASURE.</i>

23:44.907 --> 23:47.342
<i>I THINK ALL OF YOU BOATING
ENTHUSIASTS WILL BE</i>

23:47.410 --> 23:49.877
<i>INTERESTED IN THESE
PRESENTLY-AVAILABLE LOTS,</i>

23:49.945 --> 23:51.279
<i>WHICH, AS YOU CAN SEE,</i>

23:51.347 --> 23:55.102
<i>ARE CONVENIENTLY LOCATED
RIGHT NEXT TO THE MARINA.</i>

23:58.054 --> 24:00.789
<i>ALL OF THE HOUSE LOTS YOU SEE HERE</i>

24:00.857 --> 24:04.327
<i>WILL BE SOLD ON A FIRST
COME, FIRST SERVED BASIS.</i>

24:04.394 --> 24:07.430
<i>IF YOU SEE A LOT THAT APPEALS TO YOU,</i>

24:07.497 --> 24:09.265
<i>JUST TELL CHARLIE OR ME</i>

24:09.333 --> 24:14.303
<i>AND WE'LL GIVE YOU FIRST REFUSAL.</i>

24:14.371 --> 24:16.038
Larry, what do you think?

24:16.106 --> 24:19.742
It's not what I think, it's
what daddy thinks, isn't it?

24:19.809 --> 24:23.212
Honey, you know my father
only wants to help us...

24:23.280 --> 24:24.481
Both of us.

24:24.549 --> 24:27.217
He'd help us a lot more
if he'd leave us alone.

24:27.285 --> 24:31.888
Then maybe he'd be satisfied
with what I could give you.

24:31.956 --> 24:34.725
<i>YOU WILL NOTICE THAT WE
HAVE CAREFULLY PRESERVED</i>

24:34.792 --> 24:40.697
<i>THE NATURAL BEAUTY OF DREAMLAND SHORES.</i>

24:40.765 --> 24:46.503
<i>YOU'LL BE ABLE TO TAKE LONG WALKS
INTO THESE SECLUDED AREAS.</i>

24:46.804 --> 24:50.724
<i>BIRDS AND BUTTERFLIES
AND FRAGRANT FLOWERS.</i>

24:50.791 --> 24:53.292
<i>FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE GOLF ENTHUSIASTS,</i>

24:53.360 --> 24:55.496
<i>YOU'LL PROBABLY WANT TO BE SITUATED</i>

24:55.564 --> 24:57.798
<i>OVERLOOKING THE 18-HOLE GOLF COURSE,</i>

24:57.866 --> 25:00.535
<i>WHICH WILL SOON BE UNDER CONSTRUCTION.</i>

25:00.602 --> 25:03.337
<i>AFTER WE STOP AT OUR PICNIC
AREA FOR REFRESHMENTS,</i>

25:03.405 --> 25:06.373
<i>WE'LL GO ON AND LOOK AT SOME
OF THE INLAND PROPERTIES.</i>

25:06.441 --> 25:08.976
<i>HERE WE ARE.</i>

25:09.044 --> 25:13.147
Be careful getting out, now.

25:13.214 --> 25:15.082
Now, if we're really lucky,

25:15.150 --> 25:17.351
we may get some glimpses of some of

25:17.419 --> 25:20.555
the fascinating wildlife
that's in this area.

25:20.622 --> 25:23.290
Do you know there are 100
different kinds of birds here?

25:23.358 --> 25:25.092
There are? Yes.

25:25.160 --> 25:30.032
I've seen over 50 myself.

25:30.099 --> 25:32.434
Charlie?

25:32.501 --> 25:35.503
You want to help me with
the sandwiches, darling?

25:35.571 --> 25:36.704
Would you like a plate?

25:36.772 --> 25:40.242
Thank you.

25:40.310 --> 25:42.644
It almost looks like those romantic places

25:42.711 --> 25:44.913
you used to see in old movies.

25:44.981 --> 25:48.016
What does your husband
think about the idea?

25:48.084 --> 25:49.318
He's not very interested.

25:49.385 --> 25:51.553
Oh, what a shame.

25:51.620 --> 25:56.308
But your husband seems to be.

25:56.375 --> 26:01.480
Then I took one of those long, slow looks.

26:01.548 --> 26:03.717
You know the kind you
take on a rainy weekend

26:03.784 --> 26:09.455
when he's home playing
goody-goody family man?

26:09.523 --> 26:12.859
I got up one day, got dressed

26:12.927 --> 26:18.364
and told the bastard to
go back to his wife.

26:18.432 --> 26:19.766
You know something?

26:19.834 --> 26:24.537
From then on, it was just
like a breath of fresh air.

26:24.605 --> 26:29.375
I cashed in my fur coat and all
the other little knick-knacks

26:29.443 --> 26:32.947
and decided to buy myself a piece
of something really legitimate...

26:33.014 --> 26:34.448
Like a house.

26:34.515 --> 26:38.318
I could go to bed when
I wanted to go to bed.

26:38.386 --> 26:43.624
That's why I'm here.

26:43.691 --> 26:45.860
Although, you know,

26:45.927 --> 26:48.984
I really don't know what's so
great about owning a house.

26:53.235 --> 26:55.035
Thomas, what are you doing?

26:55.103 --> 26:57.304
Looking, just looking.

26:57.372 --> 26:59.740
You're trying to find fault, aren't you?

26:59.808 --> 27:02.509
You don't trust anybody.

27:02.577 --> 27:04.779
Most people are dishonest.

27:04.846 --> 27:07.382
Lets get back to the others.

27:07.449 --> 27:12.087
In a minute, in a minute.

27:12.155 --> 27:14.856
Look at this, Mary! It's a water pipe!
It isn't even connected!

27:14.924 --> 27:16.324
It's a fraud, just like I said.

27:16.392 --> 27:18.894
These people are dishonest.
This is a fraud!

27:18.961 --> 27:21.863
Trust people? I tell you, you
can't trust anybody, Mary.

27:21.931 --> 27:25.133
You can't trust anybody.

27:25.201 --> 27:26.968
I hope you've learned your lesson.
Look!

27:28.004 --> 27:29.270
What's that sound?

27:29.338 --> 27:32.608
Who cares?
I found what I was looking for.

27:32.775 --> 27:35.844
Listen, Thomas, it's all around us.

27:36.312 --> 27:37.736
Mary, will you leave...

27:40.684 --> 27:46.538
Oh, my god.

27:46.606 --> 27:47.973
Run, Mary, run!

28:00.087 --> 28:02.438
Help, Mary, help!

28:02.505 --> 28:06.408
Help, Mary, help me!

28:20.708 --> 28:23.943
Ahh!

28:24.011 --> 28:26.646
Oh, my god!

28:34.555 --> 28:36.506
<i>OVER THERE, ABOUT 50 YARDS,</i>

28:36.574 --> 28:39.309
<i>WILL BE OUR COMMUNITY RECREATION CENTER.</i>

28:39.377 --> 28:42.012
<i>IT WILL HAVE A COMPLETE
WORKSHOP AND HOBBY ROOM.</i>

28:42.080 --> 28:44.214
<i>THERE WILL BE A THEATER, A BOWLING ALLEY,</i>

28:44.282 --> 28:47.418
<i>POOL TABLES, SAUNAS, EVERY CONVENIENCE.</i>

28:47.486 --> 28:49.754
The Lawsons.
Where are the Lawsons?

28:49.821 --> 28:52.357
They ducked out back at the picnic area.

28:52.424 --> 28:54.225
Why didn't you say something?

28:54.293 --> 28:56.827
After listening to you on
that bullhorn for 2 hours,

28:56.896 --> 29:00.198
I was ready to duck out myself.

29:00.266 --> 29:01.866
Keep moving, Charlie.

29:01.934 --> 29:05.904
There's a lot more to see, everybody.

29:09.825 --> 29:11.492
What's that noise?

29:18.333 --> 29:21.703
Seems to be coming from over there.

29:21.771 --> 29:23.305
It's nothing to worry about.

29:23.372 --> 29:25.473
It's probably some of
our pumping equipment.

29:25.541 --> 29:28.543
Marilyn, there's no pump. We'd
better get back to that boat.

29:28.611 --> 29:30.545
Shut up.

29:30.613 --> 29:34.183
There's nothing to worry about, everybody.

29:34.250 --> 29:37.069
<i>WHEN YOU COMPARE ALL THE
BENEFITS OF DREAMLAND SHORES</i>

29:37.137 --> 29:39.939
<i>TO OTHER LAND INVESTMENTS
YOU MAY HAVE SEEN,</i>

29:40.006 --> 29:41.640
<i>I'M CERTAIN YOU WILL REALIZE</i>

29:41.707 --> 29:43.909
<i>WHAT A WONDERFUL VALUE WE HAVE HERE.</i>

29:51.867 --> 29:54.537
Oh, my god! Look!

29:54.605 --> 29:56.339
That's Pete, one of our workers.

29:56.407 --> 29:57.773
My god! What happened?

29:57.841 --> 29:58.941
Take it easy.

30:04.715 --> 30:08.184
Holy Jesus.

30:08.252 --> 30:12.722
Hey, we'd better go look for the Lawsons.

30:12.789 --> 30:15.858
Who'll go with me? Larry?

30:15.926 --> 30:17.953
No, I'm not going out there.

30:22.165 --> 30:25.235
No, not me. I'm an old man.

30:25.302 --> 30:26.754
We only came because it was free.

30:26.822 --> 30:28.689
We take these tours all the time.

30:28.757 --> 30:31.258
But nothing ever happened like this before.

30:31.326 --> 30:33.661
It's ok, Harry.

30:33.729 --> 30:36.764
Joe, I'll go with you.

30:36.832 --> 30:38.866
All right.

30:38.934 --> 30:41.301
We'll meet you back at the boat.

31:06.328 --> 31:07.829
Mr. Lawson!

31:32.822 --> 31:38.428
Mr. Lawson!

31:38.495 --> 31:42.565
Joe.

31:42.632 --> 31:45.818
Oh, my god.

31:47.337 --> 31:50.189
Ahh!

31:50.256 --> 31:51.454
Ahh!

31:55.295 --> 31:56.549
Ahh!

32:03.820 --> 32:05.588
Oh, my god.

32:05.655 --> 32:10.894
What the hell are they?

32:10.962 --> 32:15.065
That's my boat.

32:15.133 --> 32:16.133
Dan!

32:34.902 --> 32:38.304
Oh, my god.

32:38.373 --> 32:40.675
Let's pick them up at the beach!

32:49.551 --> 32:51.202
Get up!

33:03.548 --> 33:04.765
Ahh!

33:10.556 --> 33:12.123
Aahh!

33:28.257 --> 33:30.426
We're never gonna get out of here.

33:30.493 --> 33:32.428
Why is this happening?

33:41.988 --> 33:44.489
Larry.

33:44.557 --> 33:47.561
I can't believe this.

33:47.628 --> 33:48.788
God.

34:00.291 --> 34:03.760
They don't like fire. That's for sure.

34:03.827 --> 34:06.963
All we have to do is keep
this damn fire going.

34:13.237 --> 34:17.274
They just couldn't be.

34:17.341 --> 34:19.376
Joe?

34:19.443 --> 34:22.146
Ants.

34:22.213 --> 34:24.081
Why don't we go into the old beach house?

34:24.149 --> 34:26.382
We'll be safe inside there.

34:26.451 --> 34:29.887
Without that fire, those things would
be inside with us in 2 minutes.

34:29.955 --> 34:34.158
Goddammit, why do you shoot
down everything that I say?

34:34.225 --> 34:37.661
You never did like working for
me just because I'm a woman.

34:37.728 --> 34:39.429
They're waiting.

34:39.496 --> 34:43.801
They're out there waiting
until the fire dies.

34:43.869 --> 34:46.670
Can't you hear them?

34:46.737 --> 34:48.839
Where did they come from?

34:48.907 --> 34:51.542
How the hell did they get that size?

35:27.748 --> 35:32.051
What are you thinking?

35:32.119 --> 35:34.153
I'm thinking of a way out.

35:40.460 --> 35:44.265
All we wanted was to enjoy
what was left of our life.

35:47.134 --> 35:48.868
Is that bad?

35:55.308 --> 35:58.578
Hey, how about some candy?

35:58.645 --> 36:03.350
It's good. It'll make you feel better.

36:03.418 --> 36:06.353
Come on.

36:06.421 --> 36:08.455
It's yours if you want it.

36:29.744 --> 36:32.045
Better get some more wood for that fire.

36:32.113 --> 36:36.635
You're not gonna need any wood.

37:12.905 --> 37:13.905
Charlie?

37:13.940 --> 37:16.141
Yeah?

37:16.209 --> 37:19.211
The tent and the workers...

37:19.279 --> 37:21.213
I didn't bring them. How did they get here?

37:21.281 --> 37:24.650
A river north of here about 2 miles.

37:24.718 --> 37:27.386
We've a got boat on that
river, a small boat!

37:27.454 --> 37:31.156
You expect us to walk 2
miles through that jungle?

37:31.224 --> 37:33.792
Oh no, we're gonna stay right
here until help comes!

37:33.860 --> 37:35.327
When the hell is that gonna be, Marilyn?

37:35.395 --> 37:37.028
Look, as soon as they
know that we're missing,

37:37.096 --> 37:38.530
they'll send a search party!

37:38.598 --> 37:40.832
I am not gonna leave dreamland shores!

37:40.900 --> 37:46.139
You can stay here and be
buried on dreamland shores.

37:46.206 --> 37:48.275
That fire goes out,

37:48.342 --> 37:50.151
I'm gonna be someplace else.

37:54.782 --> 37:59.185
Well, do you want to try
for the river or not?

37:59.253 --> 38:03.709
It's unanimous, Joe. We're
all too scared to vote.

38:06.427 --> 38:07.927
No!

38:07.995 --> 38:10.397
No, they'll kill us.!

38:10.464 --> 38:13.199
Larry, why don't you
just wait for them here!

38:18.190 --> 38:21.525
Charlie, we're not leaving!

38:21.593 --> 38:24.061
I'm gonna stay here and
you're gonna stay with me.

38:24.129 --> 38:25.529
We'll go into the beach house.

38:25.597 --> 38:26.998
You're crazy, Marilyn!

38:27.065 --> 38:28.465
We've gotta go!

38:28.533 --> 38:32.519
Marilyn!

38:32.587 --> 38:33.587
Marilyn!

38:46.251 --> 38:50.322
Oh! Aah!

38:50.390 --> 38:51.723
Ahh!

38:56.829 --> 38:57.829
Keep going!

39:21.855 --> 39:25.024
Come on.

39:25.092 --> 39:28.194
Oh, god!

39:28.261 --> 39:30.863
Keep going.

39:30.931 --> 39:32.832
The beach house is full of them!

39:33.000 --> 39:34.922
Dozens of giant ants!

39:39.907 --> 39:41.257
Hurry up.

39:51.368 --> 39:53.203
Come on, hurry up.

40:01.529 --> 40:03.263
There!

40:20.048 --> 40:21.448
I can't keep up!

40:21.516 --> 40:22.916
Let's go this way.

40:35.965 --> 40:39.233
Careful, now. don't stumble.

40:56.552 --> 40:59.177
Don't worry, sweetie,
we'll be safe in there.

41:03.793 --> 41:04.793
Larry!

41:11.634 --> 41:13.235
Ahh!

41:13.303 --> 41:17.639
What? Larry, wait!

41:17.707 --> 41:18.907
Oh!

41:18.975 --> 41:20.242
My ankle!

41:25.715 --> 41:27.983
Agh!

41:28.051 --> 41:29.291
Larry!

41:36.194 --> 41:39.229
Oh, please, don't leave me!

41:39.297 --> 41:43.866
Larry!

41:58.199 --> 42:00.433
Come on. Let's go.

42:00.501 --> 42:01.801
Come on!

42:11.763 --> 42:14.281
Charlie! Charlie!

42:22.757 --> 42:23.757
Oh, god!

42:24.059 --> 42:26.677
Oh, god, no, please!

42:26.745 --> 42:28.345
Go!

43:09.222 --> 43:11.890
The rain stopped.

43:11.958 --> 43:13.659
It's a good omen.

43:29.460 --> 43:31.694
All right?

43:31.761 --> 43:34.330
There it is. There's the boat.

43:45.309 --> 43:48.744
Joe!

43:48.812 --> 43:52.299
We're coming through.

43:52.367 --> 43:54.018
We lost the old couple.

44:00.359 --> 44:03.995
Hang on.

44:04.062 --> 44:05.196
What about Christine?

44:05.263 --> 44:08.665
No, she didn't make it.

44:08.733 --> 44:10.368
Come on. I'm not going with you.

44:10.435 --> 44:12.003
Get in the boat.

44:12.070 --> 44:13.971
Charlie's dead. I want to stay with him.

44:14.039 --> 44:16.073
Get in the goddamn boat!

44:21.913 --> 44:23.648
Ok, Joe, let's go.

44:45.738 --> 44:48.573
Get your fingers out of the way. Move them.

44:59.119 --> 45:01.470
You're working for me, remember?

45:01.538 --> 45:04.390
I'm still in charge here.

45:04.457 --> 45:09.895
Would you like to row?

45:09.962 --> 45:11.330
Very funny.

46:40.639 --> 46:44.192
See? I told you we'd be safe.

46:44.260 --> 46:45.994
They're gone now.

47:11.655 --> 47:13.156
So quiet.

47:13.224 --> 47:15.591
God, why is it so quiet?

47:15.659 --> 47:18.561
We got away from them. We
left them all back there.

47:18.628 --> 47:21.464
We did, didn't we? Joe? Dan?

47:21.531 --> 47:24.800
I don't know.

47:24.869 --> 47:27.737
Thank god we're safe.

47:27.804 --> 47:29.405
Charlie never got away from them.

47:29.473 --> 47:33.493
We'll never get away from them.

47:33.561 --> 47:36.429
This has turned out to be one
hell of a free vacation.

47:43.137 --> 47:45.339
I loved Christine, you know.

47:56.985 --> 48:01.355
I hope that nice old couple got away.

48:01.423 --> 48:04.091
What were their names?

48:04.159 --> 48:08.028
Harry and velma.

48:08.096 --> 48:11.131
I wish I hadn't seen Charlie die like that.

48:17.073 --> 48:20.308
What was I supposed to do?

48:20.376 --> 48:21.536
She ran off.

48:21.544 --> 48:23.278
I turned around and she was gone.

48:23.345 --> 48:25.173
I went to look for her.

48:29.802 --> 48:31.720
Nobody's blaming you, Larry.

48:31.788 --> 48:34.589
We're not saying it's your fault.

48:34.657 --> 48:37.659
You think I saw the ants
kill her, don't you?

48:37.727 --> 48:41.363
Go ahead and say it! Go on!

48:41.431 --> 48:43.398
Why would we think that?

49:22.205 --> 49:24.608
Mr. Stratton always liked a cup of nice

49:24.676 --> 49:27.678
hot tea at the end of a hard day,

49:27.746 --> 49:32.182
with a slice of orange peel.

49:32.250 --> 49:37.421
I took very good care of him.

49:37.489 --> 49:39.656
I started there as a file clerk.

49:39.724 --> 49:43.527
And after all those years,
do you know how they gave me

49:43.595 --> 49:47.998
my notice of termination?

49:48.065 --> 49:50.567
It was a little piece of paper...

49:50.635 --> 49:54.037
A memo.

49:54.105 --> 49:55.506
"Dear Ms. Ellis,

49:55.573 --> 49:57.074
"this is to inform you

49:57.142 --> 49:59.143
"that your services are no longer required

49:59.211 --> 50:03.615
"and your employment is hereby terminated.

50:03.683 --> 50:06.951
You will receive the usual severance pay,

50:07.019 --> 50:09.544
as is customary with this firm.

50:13.759 --> 50:16.327
Mr. Stratton didn't even sign it.

50:29.158 --> 50:30.524
I've never done anything like this,

50:30.592 --> 50:32.927
never taken any chances,

50:32.995 --> 50:35.429
never done anything dangerous.

50:35.497 --> 50:38.732
It's not fair that this
should happen to me.

50:38.800 --> 50:40.266
Oh, Larry,

50:40.334 --> 50:41.968
if it's any consolation,

50:42.036 --> 50:44.933
none of us are enjoying this
boat ride anymore than you are.

50:48.592 --> 50:51.995
Main part of the river looks
like it comes from that way.

51:04.075 --> 51:06.944
It's to the left. We should go left.

51:07.011 --> 51:10.931
I'm glad somebody's sure.

51:10.998 --> 51:13.300
Either way, just as long as we keep moving.

51:13.367 --> 51:15.868
It's my life, goddammit! Go left!

52:58.687 --> 53:00.253
Congratulations, Larry.

53:00.321 --> 53:02.522
You're also a dynamite navigator.

53:02.591 --> 53:03.624
Go to hell.

53:03.692 --> 53:08.095
Shut up, you two.

53:08.162 --> 53:12.332
Why don't you all shut up?

53:12.400 --> 53:14.468
We can get around it.

53:14.535 --> 53:17.471
If you say so, Larry. You're the navigator.

53:25.246 --> 53:30.283
Can you move it?

53:30.351 --> 53:31.685
Why don't we walk it around?

53:31.753 --> 53:33.120
I don't want to portage it.

53:33.187 --> 53:38.008
How can we get past that?

53:38.076 --> 53:40.210
Dan! Dan!

53:48.835 --> 53:51.904
Get them away!

53:51.972 --> 53:53.572
Dan!

55:06.728 --> 55:09.030
Larry, I'm...

55:09.098 --> 55:13.201
I'm sorry about the navigator
crack, if it matters.

55:13.269 --> 55:16.404
It doesn't.

55:16.472 --> 55:18.672
Ok. Forget it.

55:18.739 --> 55:20.741
We're all on edge.

55:20.809 --> 55:22.609
We say things we don't mean.

55:22.677 --> 55:25.011
Yeah, well, tell that bitch, don't tell me.

56:04.718 --> 56:06.318
Look out!

56:12.858 --> 56:14.358
Help me!

56:14.426 --> 56:15.927
Help me!

56:58.286 --> 57:03.207
God help me!

57:03.274 --> 57:06.509
We'll be fine along the beach.

57:06.577 --> 57:11.448
Watch that tree!

57:11.515 --> 57:12.515
Ok.

57:19.858 --> 57:25.178
Oh!

57:25.246 --> 57:29.817
Let's continue upstream.

57:29.885 --> 57:32.019
We'll just follow the river.

58:16.630 --> 58:18.497
Hold it!

58:18.566 --> 58:20.833
What? What is it?

58:20.901 --> 58:23.269
Ahh...

58:23.336 --> 58:25.104
Nothing.

58:25.172 --> 58:29.340
Thought I heard something.

58:29.408 --> 58:31.476
Listen! Wait a minute.

58:31.544 --> 58:33.879
I told you that this river
didn't lead anywhere.

58:33.947 --> 58:36.615
You should have listened to me, dammit!

58:36.683 --> 58:38.450
I don't care what the rest of you do.

58:38.517 --> 58:40.619
I am gonna go in this direction!

58:40.687 --> 58:42.120
Marilyn! Marilyn!

58:44.807 --> 58:48.510
Ahh!

59:07.313 --> 59:08.947
It's all right.

59:17.739 --> 59:19.310
What do we do now?

59:23.879 --> 59:29.082
Obviously, they can kill
us any time they want to.

59:29.150 --> 59:31.919
They just don't seem to want to right now.

59:31.987 --> 59:35.255
Why not?

59:35.323 --> 59:37.558
Can't you tell?

59:37.626 --> 59:38.859
What do you mean?

59:38.927 --> 59:40.694
I mean, they don't want us to go that way

59:40.762 --> 59:43.030
and they don't want us to
go back the way we came.

59:50.371 --> 59:55.108
That only leaves one way... upstream.

59:55.176 --> 59:58.445
Oh, my god! They're herding us like cattle!

01:00:27.024 --> 01:00:28.024
Ahh!

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.317
God, where'd they come from?

01:00:53.083 --> 01:00:55.383
Let's get the hell out of here.

01:01:48.404 --> 01:01:52.900
Oh, my god!
It's civilization!

01:01:56.445 --> 01:01:58.629
Where are we?

01:01:58.697 --> 01:02:01.232
Is there a town near here?

01:02:01.299 --> 01:02:05.202
You folks look like you've been
out in that storm all night.

01:02:05.270 --> 01:02:07.472
It wasn't the storm that bothered us.

01:02:07.539 --> 01:02:12.760
There's a real horror show
coming upriver behind us.

01:02:12.827 --> 01:02:14.862
Giant ants, big as you are.

01:02:14.929 --> 01:02:17.965
They've already killed killed some people.

01:02:18.032 --> 01:02:20.634
Phoebe will call the sheriff.

01:02:20.701 --> 01:02:24.103
Have you seen them?

01:02:24.171 --> 01:02:28.107
Phoebe! Call the sheriff!

01:02:28.309 --> 01:02:30.209
Phoebe's a very good wife.

01:02:46.310 --> 01:02:50.613
Giant ants. That's hard to believe.

01:02:50.681 --> 01:02:53.083
Never thought I'd live to see the day.

01:02:53.150 --> 01:02:55.851
What are you gonna do, sheriff?

01:02:55.919 --> 01:02:57.320
Well...

01:02:57.388 --> 01:02:59.622
First thing, I'm gonna
get you people situated.

01:02:59.690 --> 01:03:01.191
Then I'll get some deputies

01:03:01.258 --> 01:03:04.327
and go back to the river
and start searching.

01:03:04.395 --> 01:03:06.729
I told you, those things
are vicious as hell.

01:03:06.797 --> 01:03:09.030
A couple of deputies
won't do you much good.

01:03:09.099 --> 01:03:11.066
I got a whole town if I need it.

01:03:11.134 --> 01:03:13.102
I don't know how many
of them are out there.

01:03:13.169 --> 01:03:14.503
don't worry about it.

01:03:14.571 --> 01:03:20.476
Any ants come this way,
we'll take care of them.

01:03:20.543 --> 01:03:22.745
The sugar refinery.

01:03:22.812 --> 01:03:26.881
On the way back, I better alert them.
They're so close to the river.

01:03:26.949 --> 01:03:28.883
You folks don't have to worry anymore.

01:03:28.951 --> 01:03:31.220
All you have to do is rest,

01:03:31.287 --> 01:03:33.455
unwind and we'll get you cleaned up.

01:03:53.726 --> 01:03:56.427
I radioed one of my deputies
to make arrangements.

01:03:56.495 --> 01:03:58.729
I hope this place is nice
enough for you folk.

01:03:58.797 --> 01:04:03.134
That's very kind of you, sheriff.

01:04:03.202 --> 01:04:05.036
Sheriff, I'd like to make a phone call.

01:04:05.104 --> 01:04:07.906
My friend at the state capital
could get help here fast.

01:04:07.973 --> 01:04:10.708
Sure, go ahead.

01:04:10.776 --> 01:04:13.044
What I really want to do is go home.

01:04:13.112 --> 01:04:16.397
As soon as we get the main highway
open, you can all be on your way.

01:04:16.465 --> 01:04:18.199
don't tell me your problems, Harrison,

01:04:18.267 --> 01:04:19.933
and I won't tell you mine.

01:04:20.001 --> 01:04:22.136
I want that shipment of sugar in my town

01:04:22.204 --> 01:04:24.572
by day after tomorrow or you can forget it.

01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:27.175
Mayor, you got some customers here.

01:04:27.242 --> 01:04:30.278
Be with you in a minute.
Long-distance phone.

01:04:30.345 --> 01:04:33.998
Yeah, I'd like to place a
person-to-person call to Mr. John Amstead

01:04:34.066 --> 01:04:36.518
in the state attorney's
office at the capital.

01:04:36.585 --> 01:04:38.936
Any more problems, you
call me at once, you hear?

01:04:39.004 --> 01:04:42.372
Anson Parker. He owns the motel.
He's also our mayor.

01:04:42.439 --> 01:04:44.040
Very wealthy.

01:04:44.108 --> 01:04:47.510
don't take 3 days to drive those
rigs from your place to mine.

01:04:47.578 --> 01:04:49.412
It's a lousy 800 miles.

01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:51.631
Tell the men to drive all
night if they have to.

01:04:51.699 --> 01:04:56.569
Remember that sugar refinery
we passed on our way here?

01:04:56.637 --> 01:04:58.838
Something funny.

01:04:58.906 --> 01:04:59.939
Funny?

01:05:00.007 --> 01:05:01.808
Yeah.

01:05:01.876 --> 01:05:04.878
When we were back at
that old couple's house,

01:05:04.945 --> 01:05:06.680
the woman said something to me

01:05:06.747 --> 01:05:09.082
that just didn't make sense, that's all.

01:05:09.150 --> 01:05:10.650
What did she say?

01:05:10.718 --> 01:05:13.386
She said, "whatever you do,

01:05:13.453 --> 01:05:16.232
don't let them take you
to the sugar refinery."

01:05:17.758 --> 01:05:21.061
Isn't that crazy?

01:05:21.128 --> 01:05:24.064
There's no way to get a call through?

01:05:24.131 --> 01:05:27.800
Dammit, don't you have
some emergency lines?

01:05:27.867 --> 01:05:30.385
It's none of your business
what I'm doing with the sugar.

01:05:30.453 --> 01:05:32.788
Our refinery is turning out all it can,

01:05:32.856 --> 01:05:36.926
full blast and we need more.

01:05:36.993 --> 01:05:42.664
Ok. Fine. Bye-bye.

01:05:42.732 --> 01:05:44.399
Sorry.

01:05:44.467 --> 01:05:46.618
A little business problem.

01:05:46.686 --> 01:05:49.088
You must have come up
from dreamland shores.

01:05:49.155 --> 01:05:52.474
How did you know we came
from dreamland shores?

01:05:52.542 --> 01:05:55.244
Fix these people up with
something real nice, mayor.

01:05:55.312 --> 01:05:56.678
The best in the house.

01:05:56.746 --> 01:05:58.447
Y'all just sign the register, please?

01:05:58.514 --> 01:06:00.182
I guess I've done all that I can.

01:06:00.250 --> 01:06:01.951
I'll go back to the river and look for...

01:06:02.018 --> 01:06:03.986
What you were talking about.

01:06:04.054 --> 01:06:05.254
A problem, sheriff?

01:06:05.322 --> 01:06:07.022
I'll tell you later when I've more time.

01:06:07.090 --> 01:06:08.991
If I find anything, I'm gonna let you know.

01:06:09.059 --> 01:06:11.460
You'll find something.

01:06:11.527 --> 01:06:13.996
You know, I think you're right.

01:06:21.270 --> 01:06:24.638
Is there any place around
here I can rent a car?

01:06:24.706 --> 01:06:26.674
A couple of blocks up the street.

01:06:26.742 --> 01:06:28.776
Good, we're gonna want to get home.

01:06:28.844 --> 01:06:31.946
Why don't you guys get
some rest for a while?

01:06:32.014 --> 01:06:33.147
I'll sleep to that.

01:06:33.215 --> 01:06:36.517
All I need is a hot bath.

01:06:36.585 --> 01:06:38.386
If you fellows have any problems,

01:06:38.453 --> 01:06:40.154
just tell them to call me.

01:06:40.222 --> 01:06:45.843
Yeah, we'll do that. Thanks.

01:06:45.911 --> 01:06:47.478
Finish your phone call?

01:06:47.545 --> 01:06:51.315
No, all the lines are down
because of the storm.

01:06:51.383 --> 01:06:53.584
That's odd, the mayor was
talking long-distance.

01:06:53.652 --> 01:06:56.620
How do you suppose they
got his call through?

01:07:44.018 --> 01:07:45.518
Driver's license?

01:07:45.586 --> 01:07:50.406
Yes, we need it to verify that
you're a qualified driver.

01:07:50.474 --> 01:07:52.541
I lost it. What about you?

01:07:52.609 --> 01:07:53.543
I don't have anything.

01:07:53.611 --> 01:07:57.546
Look, Miss, the mayor said if we
had any trouble, you could call him.

01:07:57.614 --> 01:08:01.968
Well, I will need a name.
You didn't lose that, did you?

01:08:02.035 --> 01:08:04.070
Joseph morrison.

01:08:04.138 --> 01:08:07.273
And your local address, Mr. morrison?

01:08:07.340 --> 01:08:09.809
We don't have a local address,

01:08:09.877 --> 01:08:11.644
just the motel where we're staying.

01:08:11.711 --> 01:08:13.279
I see.

01:08:13.346 --> 01:08:15.714
Look honey, will you just call
the mayor and get us a car?

01:08:15.783 --> 01:08:17.783
Well, I'm supposed to follow the rules.

01:08:17.850 --> 01:08:20.652
Couldn't you bend the rules a little bit?

01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:23.255
Maybe I can process the
application a different way.

01:08:23.323 --> 01:08:25.323
Right. Can you come back later?

01:08:25.390 --> 01:08:26.524
How much later?

01:08:26.591 --> 01:08:28.227
Tomorrow.

01:08:28.295 --> 01:08:30.645
Tomorrow?

01:08:30.714 --> 01:08:32.631
It's the best I can do.

01:08:53.669 --> 01:08:57.201
That's the only car rental agency in town.

01:09:01.410 --> 01:09:04.812
That son of a bitch lied to us.

01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:07.247
Said they were going downriver
and look for the ants.

01:09:42.617 --> 01:09:43.883
Let's go.

01:09:54.729 --> 01:09:57.998
Careful.

01:09:58.065 --> 01:09:59.333
Didn't see us.

01:10:16.533 --> 01:10:19.335
I hope that's the last
we see of that place.

01:10:26.793 --> 01:10:28.594
What are you looking for?

01:10:28.662 --> 01:10:31.130
I'm looking for a gun.

01:10:31.197 --> 01:10:33.966
Not that we'd be that lucky.

01:10:34.034 --> 01:10:37.236
<i>THIS HIPPIE LIFE</i>

01:10:37.303 --> 01:10:41.574
and maps of Florida

01:10:41.642 --> 01:10:45.210
and some road flares.

01:10:45.278 --> 01:10:47.747
Well, at least we're set
if the car breaks down.

01:11:00.276 --> 01:11:02.911
Oh, shit.

01:11:02.979 --> 01:11:06.782
God.

01:11:06.784 --> 01:11:08.366
Get down, everybody.

01:11:42.251 --> 01:11:43.300
Get them!

01:11:43.368 --> 01:11:46.370
don't let them get away!

01:11:53.044 --> 01:11:55.512
Hey, don't shoot. We're
peaceful, honest to god.

01:11:55.580 --> 01:11:59.983
All right?

01:12:00.051 --> 01:12:01.218
Go on.

01:12:09.327 --> 01:12:11.662
All right.

01:12:11.730 --> 01:12:13.830
Can't you guys take a joke?

01:12:33.550 --> 01:12:36.653
Take it easy.

01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:40.473
Run!

01:12:40.541 --> 01:12:41.541
Dan!

01:12:47.381 --> 01:12:49.616
Go! Run!

01:12:49.683 --> 01:12:54.370
No, don't fire!

01:12:54.437 --> 01:12:56.505
We have enough here to begin with.

01:12:56.573 --> 01:12:58.141
Pick him up.

01:13:10.170 --> 01:13:13.473
We have a chance if we can get to the river

01:13:13.540 --> 01:13:16.708
and find a boat and get
help for the others.

01:13:30.490 --> 01:13:32.190
Just keep moving.

01:14:24.009 --> 01:14:26.110
There's enough sugar there to feed an army

01:14:26.178 --> 01:14:30.915
and they turn out that much every day.

01:14:30.982 --> 01:14:32.433
Keep moving!

01:14:57.441 --> 01:14:58.441
Ow!

01:17:17.595 --> 01:17:21.465
Ahh!

01:17:21.532 --> 01:17:24.835
Please, there's nothing to fear, nothing.

01:17:24.902 --> 01:17:29.305
Come along. Nothing to fear.

01:17:29.373 --> 01:17:33.509
Please, come on.

01:17:36.147 --> 01:17:38.514
Isn't she beautiful?

01:17:38.582 --> 01:17:41.951
She's fantastic.

01:17:42.019 --> 01:17:43.587
She needs us.

01:17:43.589 --> 01:17:45.789
That's why it has to be this way,

01:17:45.857 --> 01:17:49.192
why we must obey.

01:17:49.260 --> 01:17:53.384
We have no choice.
She makes us do it.

01:17:56.083 --> 01:17:59.852
At first, uh, people don't understand.

01:17:59.919 --> 01:18:02.988
They must be forced into submission.

01:18:13.766 --> 01:18:17.836
After their indoctrination,
they realize that the ants

01:18:17.904 --> 01:18:23.041
only want us to take care
of them and to feed them.

01:18:23.109 --> 01:18:25.010
Every week, the people must be brought

01:18:25.077 --> 01:18:27.711
back here to be indoctrinated again.

01:18:32.018 --> 01:18:33.685
She's the only one that can do it.

01:18:33.753 --> 01:18:35.454
She's the queen ant.

01:18:41.561 --> 01:18:43.812
You see how easy it is.

01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:46.381
Once you feel her energy,
then you'll understand

01:18:46.448 --> 01:18:49.317
that we can all work together.

01:18:49.385 --> 01:18:52.119
We can all do what the ants want us to.

01:18:52.188 --> 01:18:54.355
Work for them, feed them.

01:18:54.423 --> 01:18:57.592
That's the way it should
be, for they are superior.

01:19:06.251 --> 01:19:08.953
Since you are our guests,

01:19:09.020 --> 01:19:12.022
won't you take the front
of the line, please?

01:19:12.091 --> 01:19:13.091
No!

01:20:05.109 --> 01:20:10.213
Keep your hands off me, you son of a bitch!

01:20:15.353 --> 01:20:17.437
Joe!

01:20:17.505 --> 01:20:19.373
Put them here with the others.

01:20:20.457 --> 01:20:21.834
- Stop it!
- Quiet down!

01:20:25.795 --> 01:20:29.164
No! No! Please!

01:20:29.232 --> 01:20:33.869
No, let me go! Please!

01:20:33.937 --> 01:20:35.871
Let me out of here.

01:21:08.020 --> 01:21:11.222
don't you see? We mustn't disobey them.

01:21:11.290 --> 01:21:15.092
We must take care of them
and we must help them.

01:21:20.332 --> 01:21:22.901
Keep the line moving.

01:21:39.969 --> 01:21:43.538
Get him out of there!

01:21:53.898 --> 01:21:56.333
You can't!

01:23:01.849 --> 01:23:04.817
Take the women down to the river!

01:23:04.885 --> 01:23:07.753
Go on! Get the hell out of here!

01:24:16.254 --> 01:24:19.523
Uh.

01:24:31.068 --> 01:24:33.570
Joe!

01:24:33.638 --> 01:24:35.305
Oh, god! Joe!

01:25:44.358 --> 01:25:47.159
Where is he? Where is he?

01:25:54.567 --> 01:25:55.567
No!

01:26:02.275 --> 01:26:05.677
Get in the boat.

01:26:05.744 --> 01:26:08.413
Get her in the boat!

01:26:08.481 --> 01:26:09.647
Joe!

01:26:09.715 --> 01:26:11.216
Dan!

01:26:49.338 --> 01:26:51.011
Joe!
