\hNARRATOR: Tonight on
The Curse of Oak Island...

00:02.132 --> 00:04.660
Are you ready to put some coil
to the soil, mate?

00:04.660 --> 00:06.000
-MICHAEL J.: I’m ready.
-Let’s go for it.

00:06.000 --> 00:07.528
(chuckles):
Oh, what have we got here?

00:07.528 --> 00:10.660
-Oh, yeah.
-GARY: Ooh! Look at that, mate.

00:10.660 --> 00:12.132
-Is that something?
-GARY: Wow.

00:12.132 --> 00:13.396
That is spectacular.

00:13.396 --> 00:16.660
-SPENCE: Why does it have
these angles?
-Does it cry "ship"?

00:16.660 --> 00:18.264
It could easily be
part of a ship.

00:18.264 --> 00:19.660
Well, how about that?
(chuckles)

00:19.660 --> 00:21.726
-TEDFORD: Hey, Craig!
-CHARLES: I think
they might have it.

00:21.726 --> 00:23.462
-TEDFORD: There it is.
-TERRY: Oh!

00:23.462 --> 00:25.000
What the...? Check that out!

00:25.000 --> 00:28.363
That’s a phenomenon right there.

00:29.462 --> 00:33.132
NARRATOR:
There is an island
in the North Atlantic

00:33.132 --> 00:36.000
where people
have been looking for

00:36.000 --> 00:40.000
an incredible treasure
for more than 200 years.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.528
So far, they have found
a stone slab

00:42.528 --> 00:45.759
with strange symbols
carved into it...

00:46.000 --> 00:49.000
...man-made workings
that date to medieval times,

00:49.000 --> 00:54.264
and a lead cross
whose origin may be connected

00:54.264 --> 00:55.330
to the Knights Templar.

00:55.330 --> 00:57.726
To date, six men have died

00:57.726 --> 01:00.264
trying to solve the mystery.

01:00.264 --> 01:05.660
\hAnd according to legend,
one more will have to die

01:05.660 --> 01:10.330
before the treasure
can be found.

01:13.660 --> 01:16.528
♪ ♪

01:20.726 --> 01:23.396
TERRY:
A-13 is underway.

01:23.396 --> 01:27.528
Hoping to connect into
the same structure that gave us

01:27.528 --> 01:29.066
-all that compressed air.
-Yep.

01:29.066 --> 01:31.000
NARRATOR:
An especially hopeful day

01:31.000 --> 01:32.528
has begun on Oak Island

01:32.528 --> 01:35.000
for brothers
Rick and Marty Lagina,

01:35.000 --> 01:36.726
their partner Craig Tester

01:36.726 --> 01:38.726
and members of their team
as they

01:38.726 --> 01:42.000
begin drilling a borehole
known as A-13.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.330
TERRY:
Game on, Charles.

01:43.330 --> 01:44.495
-CHARLES: Game on.
\h-TERRY: A chamber

01:44.495 --> 01:47.000
-could lay beneath.
\h-NARRATOR: It is their belief

01:47.000 --> 01:49.132
that they may be
within striking distance

01:49.132 --> 01:51.660
of something
that has eluded searchers

01:51.660 --> 01:54.198
for 227 years:

01:54.198 --> 01:58.132
the legendary
Money Pit treasure vault.

01:58.132 --> 02:00.132
That was good.

02:00.132 --> 02:03.495
We are very close
to where we started

02:03.495 --> 02:07.660
to get all that air eruption
from what we thought was

02:07.660 --> 02:09.099
a subterranean chamber.

02:09.099 --> 02:13.066
-I-I think it’s got to be
a chamber or something.
-TERRY: Sure.

02:13.066 --> 02:14.132
CRAIG:
Something man-made.

02:14.132 --> 02:15.330
CHARLES:
It’s quite possible.

02:15.330 --> 02:16.264
But the only way we’re gonna

02:16.264 --> 02:19.000
find out,
we drill down and get to it.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.330
Yeah.

02:20.330 --> 02:23.396
So, what we’ve got here
on the screen...

02:23.396 --> 02:24.660
These, I’m almost very certain

02:24.660 --> 02:27.264
that they are
some sort of a tunnel.

02:27.264 --> 02:28.528
Interesting.

02:28.528 --> 02:30.066
NARRATOR:
One week ago,

02:30.066 --> 02:31.660
geophysicist Jeremy Church

02:31.660 --> 02:33.132
presented the team

02:33.132 --> 02:33.759
with seismic data...

02:33.759 --> 02:35.132
JEREMY:
So, if we go right in...

02:35.132 --> 02:38.066
NARRATOR: ...that revealed
a possible underground tunnel

02:38.066 --> 02:39.396
extending through the area

02:39.396 --> 02:42.594
that the team has dubbed
the C-1 cluster.

02:42.594 --> 02:44.396
It has to be from some sort

02:44.396 --> 02:45.330
of human activity.

02:45.330 --> 02:46.660
NARRATOR:
It has been in this same area

02:46.660 --> 02:50.726
that they recently detected
evidence of both silver and gold

02:50.726 --> 02:52.726
in numerous boreholes.

02:52.726 --> 02:54.000
JEREMY:
The other thing is

02:54.000 --> 02:57.726
this low-density
cave-type feature right here.

02:57.726 --> 02:59.528
I call it "the structure."

02:59.528 --> 03:01.660
NARRATOR:
However, Jeremy also noted

03:01.660 --> 03:04.000
a second compelling discovery.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.264
What size is that structure?
Just approximately.

03:07.264 --> 03:10.264
12 feet by 12 feet tops.

03:12.066 --> 03:14.000
Oh! Oh!

03:14.000 --> 03:16.066
-Oh!
-TERRY: Holy cow.

03:16.066 --> 03:17.198
We’ve never seen that before.

03:17.198 --> 03:18.264
-That’s unusual.
-Blowing water up.

03:18.264 --> 03:22.066
NARRATOR: When the team drilled
a borehole known as AB-13

03:22.066 --> 03:24.396
in the hopes
of locating the structure...

03:24.396 --> 03:28.000
-Oh, boy.
\h-NARRATOR: ...at a depth
\hof some 60 feet,

03:28.000 --> 03:29.594
massive amounts of air

03:29.594 --> 03:33.264
suddenly began shooting up
to the surface.

03:33.264 --> 03:34.396
Okay, guys.

03:34.396 --> 03:36.528
-Explain the air to me.
-TERRY: Okay, so,

03:36.528 --> 03:39.396
one thing’s for sure:
there’s a cavity.

03:39.396 --> 03:42.099
NARRATOR:
The mysterious burst of air

03:42.099 --> 03:44.264
offered evidence
of something Marty Lagina

03:44.264 --> 03:46.231
has long suspected.

03:46.231 --> 03:48.495
And this same phenomenon
would occur

03:48.495 --> 03:51.594
-for the famous offset chamber,
wouldn’t it?
-Exactly.

03:51.594 --> 03:53.660
NARRATOR:
A so-called offset chamber

03:53.660 --> 03:56.264
constructed away
from the original Money Pit

03:56.264 --> 03:59.594
where the elusive treasure vault
has been safely hidden

03:59.594 --> 04:03.132
for more than two centuries.

04:03.396 --> 04:04.660
CHARLES:
We got a core coming.

04:04.660 --> 04:09.132
NARRATOR:
Now as the team
drills Borehole A-13

04:09.132 --> 04:12.000
just two and a half feet
to the north...

04:12.000 --> 04:12.660
ADAM:
48.

04:12.660 --> 04:15.000
-CHARLES: 48.
-TERRY: Thank you.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.132
NARRATOR:
...if they can penetrate
the mysterious void

04:18.132 --> 04:20.000
or chamber once again

04:20.000 --> 04:21.264
and recover evidence

04:21.264 --> 04:23.066
of anything valuable
inside of it,

04:23.066 --> 04:27.396
they will dig a massive
ten-foot-wide steel-cased shaft

04:27.396 --> 04:32.198
in an effort to finally solve
the Oak Island mystery.

04:32.198 --> 04:35.198
The presence of air
trapped underground

04:35.198 --> 04:37.264
at relatively shallow depths

04:37.264 --> 04:41.396
indicates some sort of cavity,
cavern.

04:41.396 --> 04:42.528
Something that can trap air.

04:42.528 --> 04:45.462
So, that’s kind of
what we’re looking for.

04:45.462 --> 04:46.330
We’re getting loose already.

04:46.330 --> 04:47.462
I wonder if it’s gonna be
loose enough

04:47.462 --> 04:50.660
for us to run into a chamber
or a cavern.

04:51.198 --> 04:52.330
MARTY:
What it merits is

04:52.330 --> 04:54.726
\hsome delineation,
some more drilling

04:54.726 --> 04:58.396
around this air pocket
to see what the heck it is.

04:58.396 --> 05:00.462
TERRY:
Mother Nature’s finest.

05:00.462 --> 05:02.660
That’s how loose
I want to see it.

05:02.660 --> 05:07.660
Is that just indication
we’re close to a chamber?

05:07.660 --> 05:10.066
TERRY:
Well, if there’s an opening,

05:10.066 --> 05:12.528
that opening
is partially full of air,

05:12.528 --> 05:13.396
partially full of water.

05:13.396 --> 05:16.000
And that looseness
that’s created

05:16.000 --> 05:17.495
is gonna soften everything up

05:17.495 --> 05:19.000
and make everything all
the more saturated

05:19.000 --> 05:23.066
-and could lead to a chamber
or a cavern.
-Okay.

05:23.066 --> 05:26.396
TERRY:
Next two or three cores
will tell the tale.

05:26.396 --> 05:28.000
CRAIG:
All right. Continue on.

05:28.000 --> 05:32.132
NARRATOR:
While the drilling operation
continues at the Money Pit...

05:32.132 --> 05:35.396
GARY: There’s the first
spicy meatball coming up.

05:35.396 --> 05:39.132
NARRATOR:
...near the southern edge
of the triangle-shaped swamp...

05:39.132 --> 05:41.264
-We should pull up
some interesting stuff.
-PETER: Yeah.

05:41.264 --> 05:43.726
We’ll, uh, we’ll get in there
with you and keep an eye out.

05:43.726 --> 05:46.000
NARRATOR: Metal detection expert
Gary Drayton

05:46.000 --> 05:50.000
along with Rick and Marty’s
nephews Peter and David Fornetti

05:50.000 --> 05:53.594
search alongside heavy equipment
operator Billy Gerhardt

05:53.594 --> 05:58.396
for important clues that may
lie buried in the muck and mud.

05:58.396 --> 05:59.594
This is, like, the...

05:59.594 --> 06:03.396
the main triangle of activity
in the swamp.

06:03.396 --> 06:07.363
I’m hoping that Billy
and this long-range excavator

06:07.363 --> 06:10.066
is the difference this year
in this area.

06:10.066 --> 06:12.660
-PETER: Mm-hmm.
-And that’s what we’re doing.

06:12.660 --> 06:14.264
Getting boggy with it.

06:14.264 --> 06:15.528
(all laugh)

06:15.528 --> 06:17.528
NARRATOR:
Over the past several years,

06:17.528 --> 06:20.660
while searching this area,
which is just west

06:20.660 --> 06:23.264
of the potentially ancient
stone ship’s wharf,

06:23.264 --> 06:25.660
the team has discovered
compelling evidence

06:25.660 --> 06:28.528
that the swamp
was not only man-made

06:28.528 --> 06:30.132
but ingeniously designed

06:30.132 --> 06:32.396
to hide something
of great importance

06:32.396 --> 06:34.066
and possible value.

06:34.066 --> 06:38.264
These include pieces
of wooden cargo barrels,

06:38.264 --> 06:41.264
fragments of a ship

06:41.264 --> 06:42.660
and even seismic data

06:42.660 --> 06:45.660
that identified
a 200-foot-long object

06:45.660 --> 06:47.528
resembling the size and shape

06:47.528 --> 06:49.528
of an ancient treasure galleon.

06:49.528 --> 06:52.000
RICK:
Every time we do dig,

06:52.000 --> 06:53.000
we find things.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.264
We found the stone road.

06:54.264 --> 06:55.396
We found the stone path.

06:55.396 --> 06:59.660
We’re now digging
in the edge of the swamp road,

06:59.660 --> 07:01.627
and we’re finding artifacts.

07:01.627 --> 07:04.264
We can start putting
the puzzle pieces together,

07:04.264 --> 07:08.396
and hopefully, we’ll finally,
once and for all,

07:08.396 --> 07:11.132
understand what happened
in the swamp.

07:11.132 --> 07:12.528
GARY:
What’ve you got, Pete?

07:12.528 --> 07:16.330
-Is that something?
-GARY: Oh, yeah.

07:16.660 --> 07:19.528
Wow, that is spectacular.

07:19.528 --> 07:22.660
Definitely
an unusual-shaped piece.

07:22.660 --> 07:24.462
No idea what it is.

07:24.462 --> 07:27.132
Perhaps part of a tabletop.

07:27.132 --> 07:31.264
And look, you can see where this
has been beveled a little bit.

07:31.264 --> 07:33.330
This was... Had a specific use.

07:33.330 --> 07:37.000
You’d assume that something
like this would have been

07:37.000 --> 07:38.198
maybe inside a ship.

07:38.198 --> 07:40.000
-Yeah.
-Not part of an outside.

07:40.000 --> 07:43.363
But very, very cool piece.

07:43.363 --> 07:44.396
I love the shape.

07:44.396 --> 07:47.594
MARTY:
There’s a trapezoid piece
of wood from the swamp

07:47.594 --> 07:52.198
that’s absolutely, positively,
clearly shaped by human hands.

07:52.198 --> 07:53.396
There’s no doubt.

07:53.396 --> 07:54.330
Who knows what it was,

07:54.330 --> 07:56.132
but it might have been
from a bigger ship.

07:56.132 --> 07:57.396
We need to test this thing.

07:57.396 --> 08:00.000
I’m convinced
something happened here.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.198
Something pretty big.

08:02.198 --> 08:07.330
So, this is just another piece
that corroborates that.

08:10.396 --> 08:13.660
Piece just came out
of the bucket there that’s cut.

08:13.660 --> 08:15.759
GARY:
Oh, yeah, I see it.

08:18.396 --> 08:20.396
Good eye, Billy.

08:21.660 --> 08:24.396
Yeah, it’s tough to tell
whether it’s a piece

08:24.396 --> 08:26.660
of planking. I...

08:26.660 --> 08:28.132
If it was a barrel stave,

08:28.132 --> 08:30.396
it would be more curved but...

08:30.396 --> 08:33.000
Could have been like an oar
or a paddle.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.264
NARRATOR:
Part of an oar?
Could it be connected

08:36.264 --> 08:39.066
to ancient ship-related activity

08:39.066 --> 08:40.396
and offer more evidence

08:40.396 --> 08:43.396
that the swamp
was once an open harbor?

08:43.396 --> 08:46.528
-Another one
for the collection, for sure.
-Yeah.

08:46.528 --> 08:47.528
Good eye, Billy.

08:47.528 --> 08:49.000
We’ll put it with the rest

08:49.000 --> 08:51.132
-of the interesting wood.
-PETER: Sounds good.

08:51.132 --> 08:52.660
GARY:
Here we go. Next bucket up.

08:52.660 --> 08:57.231
NARRATOR:
As the investigation continues
at the swamp...

08:58.132 --> 08:59.528
SCOTT:
How we doing?

08:59.528 --> 09:01.396
TERRY:
Not bad. How you doing, Scott?

09:01.396 --> 09:04.528
NARRATOR:
...back in the Money Pit area,
Craig Tester

09:04.528 --> 09:06.000
and members of the team

09:06.000 --> 09:07.396
are approaching
their target depth

09:07.396 --> 09:10.396
of approximately 60 feet
in Borehole A-13,

09:10.396 --> 09:15.132
where they hope to encounter
a mysterious cavity or chamber.

09:15.132 --> 09:18.000
TERRY:
Starting to look maroon-ish.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.330
-Yeah.
-TERRY: Anyway,

09:19.330 --> 09:22.066
it’s pretty...
It’s maroon till, but...

09:22.066 --> 09:26.231
where’s our indication
of an open cavern?

09:26.231 --> 09:27.660
(loud whirring)

09:30.132 --> 09:31.528
(grinding)

09:33.000 --> 09:34.660
Hey, Craig!

09:34.660 --> 09:37.132
CHARLES:
Might have it.

09:45.396 --> 09:48.759
TEDFORD:
Hey, Craig! There it is.

09:50.363 --> 09:53.000
-It’s coming?
-I could see air coming out.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.726
NARRATOR:
While drilling Borehole A-13

09:55.726 --> 09:57.264
in the Money Pit area,

09:57.264 --> 09:59.264
the team has just encountered

09:59.264 --> 10:00.660
a burst of air at the surface,

10:00.660 --> 10:04.264
offering evidence that they
\hhave once again penetrated

10:04.264 --> 10:06.594
a mysterious cavern or chamber

10:06.594 --> 10:09.132
some 60 feet below ground.

10:09.132 --> 10:10.132
SCOTT:
It’s almost like

10:10.132 --> 10:12.000
there’s a bladder effect there
or something

10:12.000 --> 10:13.264
where you’re pushing
the water in

10:13.264 --> 10:14.264
and it’s compressing the air.

10:14.264 --> 10:16.132
When you break the rod,
it pushes it back out again.

10:16.132 --> 10:19.660
-It shouldn’t do that.
-TEDFORD: Yeah.

10:20.330 --> 10:23.264
TERRY:
Well, you can’t compress air,

10:23.264 --> 10:26.528
so maybe we got our cavern,
which is our bladder.

10:26.528 --> 10:28.132
Yep.

10:28.132 --> 10:30.264
RICK:
We certainly have an interest

10:30.264 --> 10:35.066
in the air bubble phenomenon
around Shaft 12

10:35.066 --> 10:37.132
indicating the possibility

10:37.132 --> 10:39.330
of an offset chamber
in that area.

10:39.330 --> 10:42.066
But there was definitely air
coming out when I was threading

10:42.066 --> 10:43.660
-on that last joint.
-Okay.

10:43.660 --> 10:46.132
RICK:
If it is and we confirm that,

10:46.132 --> 10:49.000
that may be the beginning point
of all the features

10:49.000 --> 10:51.528
that we see
around the C-1 cluster.

10:51.528 --> 10:54.462
That’s a phenomenon right there.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.264
It’s got to be a void.

10:56.264 --> 10:57.396
I would keep going.

10:57.396 --> 10:59.528
I mean,
’cause what’s in the core barrel

10:59.528 --> 11:01.594
is probably more important
to us.

11:01.594 --> 11:05.099
Just drive ahead
till you hit something hard.

11:05.099 --> 11:06.627
Okay.

11:07.132 --> 11:09.066
NARRATOR:
Is it possible

11:09.066 --> 11:10.396
that the team has drilled

11:10.396 --> 11:14.132
into an offset chamber connected
to the original Money Pit?

11:14.132 --> 11:18.198
And if so, could they have
finally pinpointed the source

11:18.198 --> 11:21.264
of the silver and gold
they detected earlier this year

11:21.264 --> 11:24.264
in the so-called C-1 cluster?

11:24.264 --> 11:26.000
-78, two.
-Oh, really?

11:26.000 --> 11:27.132
-It’s going in?
-Yeah.

11:27.132 --> 11:29.396
-Going...
Oh, going in there? Okay.
-ADAM: Yeah.

11:29.396 --> 11:34.264
RICK:
Empirical data like this
is what’s gonna drive us

11:34.264 --> 11:35.264
to the Bravo Tango call

11:35.264 --> 11:38.660
where we succeed,
where we are completely

11:38.660 --> 11:40.660
and utterly successful
in understanding

11:40.660 --> 11:45.462
who, what, when, where, why
about the Money Pit.

11:46.330 --> 11:48.231
Here it comes.

11:50.264 --> 11:51.660
ADAM:
82.

11:51.660 --> 11:54.264
TERRY:
Bottom is at 82. (grunts)

11:58.132 --> 12:02.231
Well, we got some fairly dense
material at the bottom.

12:02.231 --> 12:04.528
-CHARLES: I see that.
-TERRY: But a lot
of slush and murk

12:04.528 --> 12:05.660
up here in our recovery.

12:05.660 --> 12:09.132
I don’t think
that anything can open this up

12:09.132 --> 12:11.264
in a natural sense.
This has to be people

12:11.264 --> 12:14.132
with a will to dig
and open up a space.

12:14.132 --> 12:15.528
Oh!

12:15.528 --> 12:16.660
There we go.

12:16.660 --> 12:19.264
TERRY:
Ladies and gentlemen,

12:19.264 --> 12:20.462
what the heck?

12:20.462 --> 12:22.528
CRAIG:
Here’s another one right here.

12:23.396 --> 12:25.726
TERRY:
It almost looks like grass.

12:25.726 --> 12:28.198
Maybe eelgrass
or something washing in.

12:28.198 --> 12:29.264
NARRATOR:
Eelgrass?

12:29.264 --> 12:34.627
Found in the mysterious void
some 60 feet underground?

12:34.627 --> 12:37.132
Back in 1850,

12:37.132 --> 12:39.231
when members
of the Truro Company

12:39.231 --> 12:42.132
discovered the five
stone box drains at Smith’s Cove

12:42.132 --> 12:45.132
which converged
into a single flood tunnel

12:45.132 --> 12:46.264
leading toward the Money Pit,

12:46.264 --> 12:50.528
they found the drains covered
by layers of coconut fiber

12:50.528 --> 12:52.000
and eelgrass.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.132
These durable, organic materials

12:54.132 --> 12:56.396
worked
as a natural filtration system

12:56.396 --> 13:00.495
to keep sand and debris
out of the drains.

13:00.495 --> 13:01.726
Is it possible

13:01.726 --> 13:04.528
that the mysterious void
the team encountered

13:04.528 --> 13:06.528
was not
the long-sought treasure chamber

13:06.528 --> 13:10.396
but instead a flood tunnel
ingeniously designed

13:10.396 --> 13:12.132
to protect it?

13:12.132 --> 13:15.198
MARTY:
There is no aquifer at 55 feet.

13:15.198 --> 13:17.000
We hit some sort
of loose material

13:17.000 --> 13:19.528
that carried air,
and it wasn’t cribbed.

13:19.528 --> 13:23.627
That sort of sounds
like a flood tunnel to me.

13:24.264 --> 13:26.264
Baffling, that’s for sure.

13:26.264 --> 13:28.396
Baffling all the way around,
no question.

13:28.396 --> 13:31.528
NARRATOR:
Although the team
is disappointed

13:31.528 --> 13:34.264
\hwith the results
of Borehole A-13,

13:34.264 --> 13:37.132
the fact
that they have already detected

13:37.132 --> 13:38.000
treasure in this area

13:38.000 --> 13:40.132
and may have just encountered
a flood tunnel

13:40.132 --> 13:43.132
gives them hope
that they could still be close

13:43.132 --> 13:45.000
to the ultimate breakthrough.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.396
You know, we’re not done
exploring the area,

13:47.396 --> 13:50.528
but I think, you know,
we need to keep digging.

13:50.528 --> 13:53.231
-See what else is there.
-TERRY: Sounds good to me.

13:53.231 --> 13:55.198
CRAIG:
Let’s get going.

13:56.330 --> 13:59.759
NARRATOR:
The following morning...

14:00.396 --> 14:01.495
TEDFORD:
Yeah, baby.

14:01.495 --> 14:03.660
NARRATOR:
...while the drilling operation

14:03.660 --> 14:05.132
in the Money Pit continues...

14:05.132 --> 14:09.198
-I think today’s
gonna be good, mate.
-No doubt.

14:09.198 --> 14:11.132
NARRATOR:
At the southern edge

14:11.132 --> 14:13.528
of the triangle-shaped swamp,

14:13.528 --> 14:15.528
heavy equipment operator
Billy Gerhardt,

14:15.528 --> 14:17.660
metal detection expert
Gary Drayton

14:17.660 --> 14:19.528
and treasure hunter Michael John

14:19.528 --> 14:22.132
continue their search
for more clues

14:22.132 --> 14:24.198
and hopefully valuables.

14:24.198 --> 14:25.264
GARY:
All right, Billy.

14:25.264 --> 14:27.396
We’ll get stuck in, mate.
We’ll keep our eyes

14:27.396 --> 14:29.264
and the metal detector
to the ground

14:29.264 --> 14:31.000
-and see what we pull up.
-BILLY: Yep.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.363
-GARY: All right, mate.
-Good luck.

14:37.198 --> 14:38.396
(beeping)

14:38.396 --> 14:40.132
GARY:
Here. What we got here?

14:40.132 --> 14:41.330
What’s that?

14:41.330 --> 14:44.726
-Ooh, yeah. Look at that.
-MICHAEL J.: Wow.

14:44.726 --> 14:47.396
-That is definitely shaped.
-Yeah. No doubt.

14:47.396 --> 14:50.759
And I don’t think
it’s a barrel stave.

14:50.759 --> 14:51.726
The heck is it?

14:51.726 --> 14:55.000
To me, it looks
like probably a-a piece of oar

14:55.000 --> 14:56.264
-or a paddle or something.
-Yeah.

14:56.264 --> 14:59.660
NARRATOR:
Another piece of a possible oar?

14:59.660 --> 15:00.660
Could this artifact

15:00.660 --> 15:05.000
and the similar object
found one day ago be connected

15:05.000 --> 15:06.528
to the ship-related discoveries

15:06.528 --> 15:10.132
-the team has recovered
in the swamp?
-GARY: We recover

15:10.132 --> 15:13.660
a wide variety of pieces of wood
out of the swamp.

15:13.660 --> 15:19.000
Are we getting closer to finding
that ship in the swamp?

15:19.000 --> 15:19.660
One thing for sure,

15:19.660 --> 15:21.231
it’s definitely been shaped
by man.

15:21.231 --> 15:23.759
-Does it taper?
-GARY: Yeah, it tapers.
-MICHAEL J.: Yeah.

15:23.759 --> 15:25.264
All right, mate.
We’ll put this to one side

15:25.264 --> 15:28.528
-and let you
keep scooping, mate.
-BILLY: Yep.

15:30.099 --> 15:31.396
RICK:
We have found a number

15:31.396 --> 15:33.396
of what we believe to be
nautical items.

15:33.396 --> 15:37.528
We could possibly infer
that there might be

15:37.528 --> 15:40.132
or might have been at one point
a ship in the swamp.

15:40.132 --> 15:43.528
It’s hard to think
that it’s mere coincidence.

15:49.264 --> 15:54.132
That’s a little bit
of dimensional lumber here.

15:54.132 --> 15:55.066
MICHAEL J.:
Yeah.

15:55.066 --> 15:57.066
GARY:
Yeah, you see
those little scrapes

15:57.066 --> 16:00.396
that are taken out?
There’s a little concave area?

16:00.396 --> 16:02.594
That means it was cut
with an adze.

16:02.594 --> 16:06.528
Uh, to me,
it looks like it’s a piece

16:06.528 --> 16:09.132
-of, like, decking even.
-MICHAEL J.: Yeah.

16:09.132 --> 16:12.396
NARRATOR:
Another possible piece
of ship decking?

16:12.396 --> 16:16.132
And potentially shaped
by an adze?

16:16.132 --> 16:17.660
GARY:
Oh, look at that.

16:17.660 --> 16:21.528
\h-NARRATOR: Four weeks ago...
-GARY: Is it an old adze?

16:21.528 --> 16:23.660
-Could be.
-NARRATOR: While searching Lot 4

16:23.660 --> 16:25.660
on the western side
of the island,

16:25.660 --> 16:27.000
Gary and Rick Lagina

16:27.000 --> 16:29.726
discovered one
of these ancient cutting tools.

16:29.726 --> 16:32.264
One that Carmen Legge dated

16:32.264 --> 16:35.528
to between 1620 and 1740.

16:35.528 --> 16:38.528
This looks like it was adze-cut.

16:38.528 --> 16:39.660
NARRATOR:
Could that ancient tool

16:39.660 --> 16:43.528
have been used to shape
this wooden object?

16:43.528 --> 16:46.528
So, we’ve got the piece of wood
which was adze-cut,

16:46.528 --> 16:49.594
-and we’ve also found the adze.
-We have... Yeah.

16:49.594 --> 16:51.528
It’s brilliant.
You know what, mate?

16:51.528 --> 16:54.264
We got so many
fascinating pieces of wood

16:54.264 --> 16:57.132
-out of this area.
I’m gonna text Rick.
-Mm. Okay.

16:57.132 --> 17:00.726
-Get Rick over here,
\hcheck all this out.
-Check it out. Yeah.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.132
GARY: I mean,
this is getting interesting now,

17:03.132 --> 17:09.198
-isn’t it?
-MICHAEL J.: Yeah.

17:09.198 --> 17:11.198
-Hey, guys.
-Hey, Rick. How you doing, mate?
-How’re you doing, Rick?

17:11.198 --> 17:13.627
NARRATOR: At the southern
edge of the swamp,

17:13.627 --> 17:16.099
Rick Lagina arrives
after being alerted

17:16.099 --> 17:20.066
to several new and potentially
important discoveries

17:20.066 --> 17:21.363
and joins Gary Drayton,

17:21.363 --> 17:26.528
Michael John and Billy Gerhardt
to search for more.

17:26.528 --> 17:27.660
Because you’re not dancing,

17:27.660 --> 17:30.363
I’m assuming
you haven’t found you-know-what.

17:30.363 --> 17:34.000
No, mate. Unfortunately,
I haven’t got a wood dance yet.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.099
-(chuckles)
-If I did,

17:35.099 --> 17:36.330
it would be over some of these.

17:36.330 --> 17:38.396
If you had a wood dance,
you’d be exhausted

17:38.396 --> 17:41.495
-by now, Gary. Come on.
-(laughs) Yeah.
I’ll show you want we found.

17:41.495 --> 17:46.198
We found some really, really
\hinteresting pieces of wood.

17:46.198 --> 17:48.528
Check some of these out, mate.

17:48.528 --> 17:53.132
This, to me,
was one of the-the cooler ones.

17:53.198 --> 17:57.726
Almost looks like a piece
of decking or planking.

17:57.726 --> 17:59.264
And look, you see that?

17:59.264 --> 18:01.396
-RICK: Yeah.
-GARY: Almost
like it had been hit

18:01.396 --> 18:03.066
-by an adze.
-RICK: Yeah. Yeah.

18:03.066 --> 18:05.363
-Yeah.
-GARY: And remember,
mate, we found the adze

18:05.363 --> 18:06.627
-on Lot 4.
-Yep.

18:06.627 --> 18:08.264
GARY:
This... I mean, it’s heavy.

18:08.264 --> 18:09.363
If you feel the heft of that,

18:09.363 --> 18:13.264
-it’s a hard wood
by the feel of it.
-RICK: Mm-hmm.

18:13.264 --> 18:14.594
GARY:
And then there’s this one.

18:14.594 --> 18:17.066
That’s a little mystery object.

18:17.066 --> 18:19.231
-RICK: Hey, Bill.
-BILLY: Hey.

18:19.231 --> 18:21.000
RICK:
Look at all these.

18:21.000 --> 18:25.000
It kind of looks like
a barrel stave to me with that.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.759
Well, we thought barrel stave,

18:26.759 --> 18:30.495
but even if it was a top,
it goes in so thin.

18:30.495 --> 18:31.627
BILLY:
It’s tapered like an oar.

18:31.627 --> 18:33.627
You know an oar
is tapered like that?

18:33.627 --> 18:35.132
Like a broken paddle.

18:35.132 --> 18:36.495
Oh, a paddle.

18:36.495 --> 18:38.198
Yeah, that could be.

18:38.198 --> 18:41.726
Our only methodology here
is C-14 testing,

18:41.726 --> 18:43.594
so I would suggest this one.

18:43.594 --> 18:46.132
This one
because this is functional.

18:46.132 --> 18:49.198
This was designed
to-to serve a purpose.

18:49.198 --> 18:51.000
-Yeah.
-RICK: And this one,

18:51.000 --> 18:53.264
this one because of noticing
the adze marks.

18:53.264 --> 18:55.759
-GARY: Yeah.
\h-RICK: We have

18:55.759 --> 18:59.528
such a quantity of wood finds
from the swamp.

18:59.528 --> 19:02.132
As we look at the items
that have been found,

19:02.132 --> 19:05.363
any piece of wood
that is obviously shaped,

19:05.363 --> 19:10.330
whether there be dowels
\hor holes or saw marks,

19:10.330 --> 19:14.000
it demands for us to find
a consulting expert

19:14.000 --> 19:15.264
who can come in and tell us,

19:15.264 --> 19:18.132
"This is important
for this reason."

19:18.132 --> 19:19.528
The hope is that we

19:19.528 --> 19:22.330
maybe not find
the reason why it was used

19:22.330 --> 19:26.099
but really what is it

19:26.099 --> 19:28.231
and why is it there?

19:28.231 --> 19:29.264
GARY:
I’m hoping,

19:29.264 --> 19:31.099
Rick, that you guys can get

19:31.099 --> 19:33.198
a shipbuilding expert.

19:33.198 --> 19:36.066
Well, we do have
a marine archaeologist coming.

19:36.066 --> 19:37.000
Dr. Spence.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.132
World-renowned, world-class.

19:39.132 --> 19:42.099
So, we’re gonna do
exactly what you suggest:

19:42.099 --> 19:44.198
round up
all the things that even have

19:44.198 --> 19:46.627
a bit of suspicion
that they’re maritime-related,

19:46.627 --> 19:49.594
present them to him
and see what he has to say.

19:49.594 --> 19:50.396
Excellent.

19:50.396 --> 19:53.627
And this is the type of stuff
that hopefully will

19:53.627 --> 19:57.330
lead us to some of those
round things that I like.

19:57.330 --> 19:59.264
They’ve got to be here.

19:59.264 --> 20:00.099
Yeah.

20:00.099 --> 20:03.000
Keep it all,
wash it, catalog it.

20:03.000 --> 20:06.759
-And then the only thing to do
is keep going.
-Yeah. Okay.

20:06.759 --> 20:10.528
RICK:
Okay. Let’s do it.

20:16.099 --> 20:19.198
-NARRATOR:
The following morning...
-CHARLES: Did I tell you

20:19.198 --> 20:21.660
that when we get close to 50,
we got to give Craig a call?

20:21.660 --> 20:23.528
-No, no, I heard that. Yeah.
-CHARLES: Just to be...

20:23.528 --> 20:25.363
NARRATOR:
...while the drilling operation

20:25.363 --> 20:27.132
continues at the Money Pit...

20:27.132 --> 20:30.066
RICK:
So, gentlemen,
we welcome Dr. Lee Spence.

20:30.066 --> 20:35.132
-Very esteemed
in marine archaeological work.
\h-NARRATOR: In the war room,

20:35.132 --> 20:38.594
Rick, Marty, Craig
and other members of the team

20:38.594 --> 20:41.759
are meeting
with underwater archaeologist

20:41.759 --> 20:43.759
and author Dr. Lee Spence.

20:43.759 --> 20:46.000
RICK:
The reason
for Dr. Spence’s visit

20:46.000 --> 20:48.627
to the... to the war room,
of course, is these are

20:48.627 --> 20:52.066
items that have been found,
uh, this year.

20:52.066 --> 20:54.627
Now, they’re not
necessarily nautical,

20:54.627 --> 20:57.132
but we thought
you might like to take a look.

20:57.132 --> 20:58.627
But before you get into that,

20:58.627 --> 21:00.396
if you could just tell Marty
and Craig

21:00.396 --> 21:01.495
a little bit
about your background?

21:01.495 --> 21:04.396
Well, it’s something...
something I’ve done all my life.

21:04.396 --> 21:09.000
-I started finding shipwrecks
when I was 12.
-Wow.

21:09.000 --> 21:12.000
I became
one of the early pioneers

21:12.000 --> 21:13.528
of modern
underwater archaeology.

21:13.528 --> 21:15.627
And I say
"modern underwater archaeology"

21:15.627 --> 21:17.462
’cause the first
underwater archaeology

21:17.462 --> 21:20.462
that I’m aware of
was actually in the 1700s.

21:20.462 --> 21:24.495
You describe yourself
as a marine archaeologist

21:24.495 --> 21:27.264
more so than a treasure hunter.

21:27.264 --> 21:30.495
Well, that’s ’cause
the objective is the history.

21:30.495 --> 21:32.462
I absolutely love history.

21:32.462 --> 21:34.330
It’s very real to me.

21:34.330 --> 21:36.396
I think it’s very important.

21:36.660 --> 21:41.231
NARRATOR: With a career that has
so far spanned six decades,

21:41.231 --> 21:45.528
Dr. Spence has discovered
more than 100 shipwrecks,

21:45.528 --> 21:49.759
including
two American Civil War vessels,

21:49.759 --> 21:52.495
the SS Georgiana

21:52.495 --> 21:53.726
and the HL Hunley,

21:53.726 --> 21:57.759
a Confederate submarine
that was considered by experts

21:57.759 --> 22:01.495
to be one of the key
underwater archaeological finds

22:01.495 --> 22:03.330
of the 20th century.

22:03.330 --> 22:06.000
His exploration
of sunken galleons

22:06.000 --> 22:10.132
that dated to between
the 16th and 19th centuries

22:10.132 --> 22:12.528
has produced
more than $50 million

22:12.528 --> 22:16.000
in recovered artifacts
and treasure.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.495
The reason
why Dr. Spence was invited here

22:17.495 --> 22:21.363
was simply because he has
a lifetime of experience

22:21.363 --> 22:22.132
diving on wrecks.

22:22.132 --> 22:24.759
We’ve never had
that type of experience

22:24.759 --> 22:26.528
to underwater archaeology

22:26.528 --> 22:30.528
that Dr. Spence
brings to the table.

22:30.759 --> 22:32.594
MARTY:
We have assembled here

22:32.594 --> 22:34.627
what we think are the more
\hship-like, I’m gonna say,

22:34.627 --> 22:38.231
or more nautical things--
least to our untrained eye--

22:38.231 --> 22:39.660
-that we pulled out
of the swamp.
-SPENCE: Okay.

22:39.660 --> 22:41.495
And we’d really like
your opinion.

22:41.495 --> 22:43.528
And you could start
wherever you like.

22:43.528 --> 22:46.660
Let me start
with this one right here.

22:47.495 --> 22:49.495
You’ve got three holes here

22:49.495 --> 22:53.231
that probably once had nails
going through them.

22:53.231 --> 22:55.660
And I can think of...

22:55.660 --> 22:59.000
Maybe at one point,
there was a board right here.

22:59.000 --> 23:03.099
You have this curved edge here
like you would on a paddle,

23:03.099 --> 23:06.099
and it’s-it’s starting
to make the curve back up.

23:06.099 --> 23:09.231
So, it wouldn’t have had to
have been much wider than this.

23:09.231 --> 23:12.330
And they nailed this in,
attached a handle to it.

23:12.330 --> 23:15.198
-That’s likely a paddle, then.
-SPENCE: To make

23:15.198 --> 23:16.264
a paddle.

23:16.264 --> 23:17.264
MARTY:
Lee, take a look

23:17.264 --> 23:20.264
at this one. This was,
uh, clearly a worked piece.

23:20.264 --> 23:22.363
We did radio carbon-date
this one,

23:22.363 --> 23:24.066
and the results are right there.

23:24.066 --> 23:28.264
DOUG:
So, this came off the swamp,
found by Billy.

23:28.264 --> 23:31.132
SPENCE:
This is man-made.

23:31.759 --> 23:35.528
And they came up with some
real interesting possibilities

23:35.528 --> 23:38.726
as far as the dates go.

23:38.726 --> 23:40.000
I find this amazing.

23:40.000 --> 23:44.660
It dates between 1520 and 1674.

23:44.660 --> 23:46.660
I’m impressed with it.

23:46.660 --> 23:49.000
But does it cry "ship"?

23:49.099 --> 23:52.198
It could easily be
part of a ship.

23:52.198 --> 23:54.264
Very easily.

24:01.000 --> 24:05.000
-MARTY: Does it cry "ship"?
-SPENCE: It could easily be
part of a ship.

24:05.000 --> 24:05.660
Very easily.

24:05.660 --> 24:07.528
NARRATOR:
In the war room,

24:07.528 --> 24:11.396
world-renowned underwater
archaeologist Dr. Lee Spence

24:11.396 --> 24:13.132
has just corroborated

24:13.132 --> 24:16.099
that a piece of wood planking
recently found

24:16.099 --> 24:18.132
by the Oak Island team
in the swamp

24:18.132 --> 24:20.660
and which was carbon-dated
to the 16th century

24:20.660 --> 24:24.627
could be part
of a large sailing vessel.

24:24.660 --> 24:28.000
\hSuch an early piece
that you’re finding,

24:28.000 --> 24:30.264
I think this was worked.

24:30.264 --> 24:31.396
I’m sure you didn’t find

24:31.396 --> 24:34.528
the oldest piece
of worked wood on the island.

24:34.528 --> 24:37.363
And yet look how old
this probably is.

24:37.363 --> 24:39.660
-MARTY: Right.
\h-Interesting.

24:39.660 --> 24:42.396
-I’m impressed with it.
-MARTY: So, it... Really,

24:42.396 --> 24:43.660
to me, the most interesting item

24:43.660 --> 24:44.660
-is right here.
-SPENCE: Yeah.

24:44.660 --> 24:47.396
I think that could be,
\hlike, a belaying pin.

24:47.396 --> 24:48.495
If that’s what it was,

24:48.495 --> 24:50.528
it would be
for a very small sailboat

24:50.528 --> 24:53.363
’cause you wouldn’t have
big line on it,

24:53.363 --> 24:56.660
and you would lace it around
to hold it in place.

24:56.660 --> 24:59.660
Or it reminds me of a fid.

24:59.660 --> 25:03.396
It can be spelled P-H-I-D
or F-I-D.

25:03.396 --> 25:05.528
-MARTY: Mm-hmm.
-SPENCE: One with this diameter

25:05.528 --> 25:07.132
would be used for working

25:07.132 --> 25:08.660
a real heavy rope.

25:08.660 --> 25:10.330
You know, like anchor cable.

25:10.330 --> 25:11.528
-Oh.
-SPENCE: Either way,

25:11.528 --> 25:13.264
-it looks nautical to me.
-MARTY: Okay.

25:13.264 --> 25:14.528
That’s what I was trying to ask.

25:14.528 --> 25:17.132
What does it do to a rope?

25:17.132 --> 25:20.264
For a fid, you’re using it
to pry the line apart.

25:20.264 --> 25:22.660
-You know how you have
the rope twisted?
-RICK: Mm-hmm.

25:22.660 --> 25:24.231
SPENCE:
And it’s real tight,

25:24.231 --> 25:26.660
and you take it,
and you stick it between,

25:26.660 --> 25:28.099
and you separate the line

25:28.099 --> 25:30.363
so you can stick
another piece in

25:30.363 --> 25:32.396
-to splice it.
-I see.

25:32.396 --> 25:33.495
MARTY:
If this was a fid--

25:33.495 --> 25:37.396
and it... and it is rather large
at the end-- it would’ve been

25:37.396 --> 25:39.231
-a large line.
-SPENCE: Yes, it would be.

25:39.231 --> 25:41.660
Yes, and I think
it’s more likely a fid

25:41.660 --> 25:44.759
-than it is a belaying pin.
-MARTY: Mm-hmm.

25:44.759 --> 25:47.726
Okay. Well, that’s interesting.

25:47.726 --> 25:50.759
RICK:
When-when did it come into use?

25:50.759 --> 25:53.132
About as long
as they’ve had rope.

25:53.132 --> 25:54.660
-(all laugh)
-So,

25:54.660 --> 25:56.759
-thousands of years.
-RICK: Wow.

25:56.759 --> 25:59.396
NARRATOR:
A possible fid? A tool designed

25:59.396 --> 26:03.132
for maneuvering large ropes
on sailing vessels?

26:03.132 --> 26:05.264
Could this artifact be connected

26:05.264 --> 26:07.000
to the other
potential ship pieces

26:07.000 --> 26:11.660
and the massive stone wharf
that were found in the swamp

26:11.660 --> 26:13.396
and also help explain

26:13.396 --> 26:16.528
the 200-foot-long
galleon-shaped anomaly

26:16.528 --> 26:18.660
detected by seismic scanning

26:18.660 --> 26:21.660
back in 2018?

26:21.660 --> 26:23.660
This would’ve been used
on a big rope,

26:23.660 --> 26:26.264
which implies big ship
visiting at some point.

26:26.264 --> 26:30.000
-And to me,
that’s the most likely.
-MARTY: Mm-hmm.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.264
RICK:
The so-called fid...

26:32.264 --> 26:34.396
I thought
that was very interesting

26:34.396 --> 26:36.528
because that instrument
has been used

26:36.528 --> 26:38.264
for a very, very long time.

26:38.264 --> 26:41.660
What is a piece
of a sailing ship doing

26:41.660 --> 26:44.396
in the swamp? I don’t know.

26:44.396 --> 26:49.000
I do know it’s worth continuing
investigating this area.

26:49.000 --> 26:52.132
-SPENCE: Now, let’s see this.
-PETER: This one?

26:53.759 --> 26:56.264
This was in the swamp

26:56.264 --> 26:58.660
near swamp road,

26:58.660 --> 27:01.528
and it was around ten feet deep.

27:02.000 --> 27:03.132
SPENCE:
When I look at this,

27:03.132 --> 27:06.132
something that immediately jumps
to my mind...

27:06.132 --> 27:09.759
Why is...
Why does it have these angles?

27:10.528 --> 27:12.264
This piece is broken off here.

27:12.264 --> 27:14.132
This is not a nice cut.

27:14.132 --> 27:15.660
This is where it broke,

27:15.660 --> 27:19.000
and so this probably
continued on down farther.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.495
-Sure.
-SPENCE: I can also see

27:21.495 --> 27:22.660
this as a step,

27:22.660 --> 27:26.132
and you have a block of wood
down here,

27:26.132 --> 27:29.396
and you’re nailing the remainder
that’s broken off here.

27:29.396 --> 27:31.000
You’re nailing it in.
At some point,

27:31.000 --> 27:33.396
-this broke off.
\h\h-RICK: Broke.
\h-MARTY: Mm-hmm.

27:33.396 --> 27:35.528
And that would explain
why there are no nails.

27:35.528 --> 27:37.396
-Yes, it would.
-SPENCE: Yeah.

27:38.132 --> 27:40.660
Which of these
would you carbon-date?

27:40.660 --> 27:42.528
SPENCE:
I probably would do-do that,

27:42.528 --> 27:44.264
but the bad thing about that

27:44.264 --> 27:46.627
-is we really don’t know
what it is.
-RICK: Mm-hmm.

27:46.627 --> 27:48.264
MARTY:
But it’s clearly worked by man,

27:48.264 --> 27:50.660
so if it came back to 1200 AD,

27:50.660 --> 27:52.627
-that would be meaningful.
-Yeah. (chuckles) Yeah.

27:52.627 --> 27:56.528
MARTY:
It’s certainly gratifying
that Dr. Spence feels

27:56.528 --> 27:58.660
that several of the items
on the table

27:58.660 --> 28:00.396
are nautical in appearance.

28:00.396 --> 28:03.132
He says, "Yes, this could be
from a ship. This is even..."

28:03.132 --> 28:05.528
I think he might have even said
"likely from a ship."

28:05.528 --> 28:07.660
We need to test
this thing more, though,

28:07.660 --> 28:09.495
because it could have
more information

28:09.495 --> 28:11.660
based on what cultures did this.

28:11.660 --> 28:13.396
We need to follow this one
a little bit.

28:13.396 --> 28:14.528
Found it very interesting.

28:14.528 --> 28:19.132
Well, Lee, look, thank you.
That was extremely informative.

28:19.132 --> 28:20.000
It’s a fresh impression

28:20.000 --> 28:22.132
on things
we just didn’t think about,

28:22.132 --> 28:23.759
and that’s always very valuable.

28:23.759 --> 28:26.264
\hSo, I thank you again
on behalf of the team.

28:26.264 --> 28:28.396
SPENCE:
Thank you for inviting me here.

28:28.396 --> 28:29.660
-RICK: Thank you.
-PETER: Thank you.

28:29.660 --> 28:31.495
NARRATOR:
As Rick, Marty and Craig

28:31.495 --> 28:33.759
finish their meeting
in the war room...

28:33.759 --> 28:37.396
GARY: So, you ready to put
some coil to the soil, mate?

28:37.396 --> 28:38.759
MICHAEL J.:
I’m ready. I’m ready.

28:38.759 --> 28:41.396
NARRATOR:
Metal detection expert
Gary Drayton

28:41.396 --> 28:43.396
and treasure hunter Michael John

28:43.396 --> 28:45.264
arrive at Lot 32.

28:45.264 --> 28:48.396
Different lot, different
treasure hunting prospects,

28:48.396 --> 28:51.231
-mate. All the time.
-Yeah. Exactly.

28:51.231 --> 28:52.660
NARRATOR:
They are eager to search

28:52.660 --> 28:57.396
for new and hopefully valuable
clues and artifacts.

28:57.396 --> 29:00.132
I expect
there’s gonna be some signs...

29:00.132 --> 29:02.396
-Yeah.
-...of wharf activity

29:02.396 --> 29:04.132
-in this area.
-Yeah, that’s right.
Exactly. Yeah.

29:04.132 --> 29:09.132
And this could be
a golden opportunity for us.

29:09.132 --> 29:10.231
That’s right.

29:10.231 --> 29:11.264
GARY:
What have we got here?

29:11.264 --> 29:14.396
-NARRATOR: Just one week ago...
-Look at the size of that.

29:14.396 --> 29:16.264
NARRATOR:
...working with Marty Lagina,

29:16.264 --> 29:18.528
Gary uncovered a large spike

29:18.528 --> 29:21.528
that may date back
three centuries or more

29:21.528 --> 29:24.396
and which blacksmithing expert
Carmen Legge believes

29:24.396 --> 29:30.264
was used to anchor ships
to large boulders on the beach.

29:35.132 --> 29:36.528
Oh.

29:36.528 --> 29:38.660
NARRATOR:
And it was also on Lot 32

29:38.660 --> 29:41.660
that, one year ago,
the team found

29:41.660 --> 29:43.396
not only a large wharf spike

29:43.396 --> 29:47.132
but also a lead cargo bag seal.

29:47.132 --> 29:48.528
With there being a wharf here

29:48.528 --> 29:51.396
and the artifacts
we’ve already recovered, mate,

29:51.396 --> 29:55.660
-I want to know
what they were unloading here.
-Yes.

29:55.660 --> 29:58.660
And what connection
this area has to the Money Pit.

29:58.660 --> 30:02.132
I got a good feeling about
this lot, especially having

30:02.132 --> 30:03.660
-so many flags to go for.
-MICHAEL J.: Yes.

30:03.660 --> 30:06.528
-All right, mate.
You ready to get stuck in?
-I’m ready.

30:06.528 --> 30:07.660
Let’s go for it.

30:07.660 --> 30:10.726
RICK:
We have made
some significant discoveries

30:10.726 --> 30:14.660
on Lot 32. Uh,
close proximity to the ocean.

30:14.660 --> 30:16.660
One could suggest or speculate

30:16.660 --> 30:18.396
that people were in that area

30:18.396 --> 30:20.660
carrying a load
on and onto a wharf.

30:20.660 --> 30:24.000
If we find that they’re headed
in a certain direction,

30:24.000 --> 30:25.396
we can draw that line.

30:25.396 --> 30:28.099
So, every little clue
is important.

30:28.099 --> 30:32.330
-Ah, mate. Another good
two-way repeatable signal.
-(beeping)

30:45.660 --> 30:50.000
-Oh, still in the hole,
I believe.
-Yes, it is.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.495
Unless it’s on the edge.

30:51.495 --> 30:54.099
Come, baby. Be in there.

30:55.132 --> 30:56.528
-(beeping)
-Oh, look at how deep

30:56.528 --> 30:58.264
-that is, mate. Yeah.
-That’s deep. Yep.

30:58.264 --> 30:59.396
Like I always tell you, Michael.

30:59.396 --> 31:02.660
-Yeah.
-Deeper it is,
the older it normally is.

31:07.264 --> 31:09.132
-Well, mate,
we’ll see if we got it out.
-Sure.

31:09.132 --> 31:13.132
-(beeping)
-You have got it out.
-I did. Yeah.

31:16.528 --> 31:18.528
(beeping)

31:18.528 --> 31:19.264
There we go.

31:19.264 --> 31:21.627
Oh, I always get excited
\hwhen you see this edge.

31:21.627 --> 31:25.396
-You see that nice,
round edge there, mate?
-Yes.

31:26.660 --> 31:29.759
Is it a coin? Or is it a button?

31:39.000 --> 31:41.363
-GARY: You see that nice,
round edge there, mate?
-MICHAEL J.: Yeah.

31:41.363 --> 31:44.132
Is it a coin? Or is it a button?

31:44.132 --> 31:46.528
-MICHAEL J.: Let it be a coin.
-GARY: It’s a coin,

31:46.528 --> 31:48.363
-mate! It’s a coin!
-Yes! Yes.

31:48.363 --> 31:50.264
-Look at that.
\h-Oh, my gosh.

31:50.264 --> 31:54.528
NARRATOR: On Lot 32,
just west of the swamp,

31:54.528 --> 31:57.330
metal detection expert
Gary Drayton

31:57.330 --> 31:59.627
and treasure hunter Michael John

31:59.627 --> 32:03.066
have just made a potentially
valuable discovery.

32:03.066 --> 32:05.528
GARY:
Now, I don’t know how old, mate.

32:05.528 --> 32:07.759
And it is always tempting

32:07.759 --> 32:10.132
just to-to rub it,

32:10.132 --> 32:12.528
-but we can’t
just in case we damage it.
-Yeah. No.

32:12.528 --> 32:16.726
GARY:
Get this to Kelly in
the archaeology trailer, mate.

32:16.726 --> 32:18.000
He’ll do his business on this.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.495
-MICHAEL J.: Mm-hmm.
-But why I’m excited

32:19.495 --> 32:23.264
about this coin, mate. It looks
like an old British copper.

32:23.264 --> 32:25.627
And it wasn’t that long ago

32:25.627 --> 32:28.363
when it was Rick, Marty,

32:28.363 --> 32:30.264
uh, Dave and I.

32:30.264 --> 32:33.132
We were on that ridge
on the other side of the swamp.

32:33.132 --> 32:35.660
We pulled two coins up.
British coppers

32:35.660 --> 32:39.264
-from the 1600s, mate.
-Yeah. Oh.

32:39.264 --> 32:41.132
GARY:
That’s Charles II.

32:41.132 --> 32:46.363
-Come on.
-Yeah, that’s Charles.
And I can see a carolus.

32:46.363 --> 32:48.726
NARRATOR:
Four years ago

32:48.726 --> 32:50.000
on Lot 16

32:50.000 --> 32:52.462
in the same area where the team
has found evidence

32:52.462 --> 32:54.099
of cargo being transported

32:54.099 --> 32:55.462
between the swamp
and the Money Pit...

32:55.462 --> 32:59.000
\h-That’s way too early
for people to be here.
\h\h-NARRATOR: ...Gary,

32:59.000 --> 33:01.627
along with Rick, Marty
and Dave Blankenship,

33:01.627 --> 33:05.000
discovered
two 17th-century British coins.

33:05.000 --> 33:08.627
-It means something!
\h-That is fantastic.

33:08.627 --> 33:11.363
This has been taking a dirt nap

33:11.363 --> 33:13.495
for a very long time.

33:13.495 --> 33:15.396
NARRATOR:
Although the team
has found evidence

33:15.396 --> 33:18.198
\hdating as far back
as the 14th century

33:18.198 --> 33:21.627
of both French and Portuguese
activity on Oak Island,

33:21.627 --> 33:24.099
could this coin
offer possible evidence

33:24.099 --> 33:27.330
that a British operation
to hide valuables here

33:27.330 --> 33:29.396
took place sometime later?

33:29.396 --> 33:32.231
Perhaps in the 17th century?

33:32.231 --> 33:34.396
I can’t believe
how thin the-the coin is, man.

33:34.396 --> 33:37.231
Which is great for us.
The thinner it is,

33:37.231 --> 33:40.330
-the more chance
that it’s an older coin.
-MICHAEL J.: Yeah.

33:40.330 --> 33:43.066
-Dang, mate. This is brilliant.
-Yeah.

33:43.066 --> 33:45.528
Oh, fantastic.

33:45.528 --> 33:46.726
-You can’t beat it.
-Yeah.

33:46.726 --> 33:49.759
GARY:
This is the reason
why Michael John and I

33:49.759 --> 33:51.594
came back to Lot 32.

33:51.594 --> 33:52.396
The chance

33:52.396 --> 33:56.660
of holding a beautiful old coin
like this in our hands.

33:56.660 --> 34:00.000
Uh, this has got 1700s
written all over it,

34:00.000 --> 34:03.594
and I’m fairly certain
when this coin is cleaned up,

34:03.594 --> 34:06.396
there is gonna be a king on it.

34:06.396 --> 34:09.726
Oh, beautiful.
Love it.

34:09.726 --> 34:12.330
You can’t beat it.

34:18.528 --> 34:20.528
GARY:
What a sloppy mess, eh?

34:20.528 --> 34:23.759
NARRATOR:
While operations continue
at both the swamp

34:23.759 --> 34:26.132
and the Money Pit area...

34:27.264 --> 34:29.132
Every day could be the day,
Charles.

34:29.132 --> 34:31.363
-RICK: Afternoon, guys.
-CRAIG: Hi, guys.

34:31.363 --> 34:34.264
-Hello, guys.
-NARRATOR: Rick
and Marty Lagina,

34:34.264 --> 34:36.099
along with their partner,
Craig Tester,

34:36.099 --> 34:38.099
have gathered
members of the team

34:38.099 --> 34:41.264
in the war room
to hear a scientific report

34:41.264 --> 34:44.000
on two of their
most recent discoveries.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.198
These two items that
we have here, both, I think,

34:46.198 --> 34:47.495
we found quite interesting.

34:47.495 --> 34:48.396
They were retrieved

34:48.396 --> 34:50.759
from roughly ten feet down
in the swamp.

34:50.759 --> 34:53.066
NARRATOR:
The first of these artifacts

34:53.066 --> 34:54.132
was found one week ago

34:54.132 --> 34:56.330
near the southern edge
of the swamp.

34:56.330 --> 34:59.627
The second, discovered
in the same area this week,

34:59.627 --> 35:02.462
was identified
as possibly being part of a ship

35:02.462 --> 35:07.099
by renowned underwater
archaeologist Dr. Lee Spence.

35:07.099 --> 35:12.000
Marty, you are well aware
of the items in front of us.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.627
We have a little one.
It’s the one

35:13.627 --> 35:16.363
that Tom Nolan mentioned
had a rope burn on it.

35:16.363 --> 35:18.594
Yeah. Yes, I’m quite aware. Yes.

35:18.594 --> 35:21.198
RICK:
And then we have
this trapezoidal piece

35:21.198 --> 35:23.264
that we thought was very old,

35:23.264 --> 35:25.759
and I think
that was really the impetus

35:25.759 --> 35:28.759
for sending it in
for C-14 testing.

35:28.759 --> 35:29.660
But we have those results,

35:29.660 --> 35:31.363
\hand Dr. Spooner’s
intrigued by them,

35:31.363 --> 35:35.132
I believe. So, he’s gonna
tell us what his thoughts are.

35:35.132 --> 35:39.132
So, the swamp is critical.

35:39.660 --> 35:41.528
Uh, as I’ve said
so many times before,

35:41.528 --> 35:44.066
the swamp is a book.

35:44.066 --> 35:46.000
Because every time we dig there,

35:46.000 --> 35:49.660
there’s something very important
that we might find out.

35:49.660 --> 35:51.000
Not just about artifacts

35:51.000 --> 35:53.660
but also about what’s gone on
in the past.

35:53.660 --> 35:56.495
You know, so, we have two pieces
in front of us. Two...

35:56.495 --> 35:58.000
Two wood pieces
that I was very interested in

35:58.000 --> 36:01.495
and because Billy found them
at significant depth.

36:01.495 --> 36:05.528
So we know it’s
in an early chapter in the book.

36:05.528 --> 36:10.132
Um, both of them look
like nautical pieces to me.

36:10.132 --> 36:11.495
And the trapezoidal piece there,

36:11.495 --> 36:17.000
it dated out at, uh,
1683 to 1735.

36:22.198 --> 36:24.396
IAN: The trapezoidal piece,
it dated out

36:24.396 --> 36:26.528
at 1683 to 1735.

36:26.528 --> 36:29.462
NARRATOR:
In the Oak Island war room,

36:29.462 --> 36:31.528
geoscientist Dr. Ian Spooner

36:31.528 --> 36:35.726
is presenting a carbon-14 report
on two wooden artifacts

36:35.726 --> 36:36.660
recently found in the swamp

36:36.660 --> 36:41.000
that he believes could be parts
of an ancient sailing vessel.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.594
-Let’s stop on that one
for a minute...
-IAN: Yeah.

36:42.594 --> 36:44.726
...’cause I just want to say
something with that piece.

36:44.726 --> 36:47.000
We looked at that
with Dr. Spence

36:47.000 --> 36:48.396
in a... in a war room,

36:48.396 --> 36:51.000
and it reminded me of something.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.660
So Scott and I
took a-a road trip,

36:52.660 --> 36:54.627
and we went to the
Maritime Museum of the Atlantic.

36:54.627 --> 36:58.594
And this is
what it reminded me of.

36:58.594 --> 37:00.066
It’s one of the longboats

37:00.066 --> 37:02.462
that you would bring
provisions and whatnot in

37:02.462 --> 37:05.132
from a bigger ship to shore.

37:05.132 --> 37:07.627
And inside that

37:07.627 --> 37:10.132
is this.

37:10.594 --> 37:12.363
It’s like a bulkhead.

37:12.363 --> 37:14.198
-IAN: Bulkheads of the boat.
-DOUG: Yep.

37:14.198 --> 37:16.231
That’s what I think that is.

37:16.231 --> 37:18.759
-Yeah, I’d agree 100%.
-DOUG: So, that makes it
really interesting

37:18.759 --> 37:21.462
-because it is
something nautical...
-IAN: Right.

37:21.462 --> 37:25.264
...in our swamp.
Or-or it would appear to be.

37:25.264 --> 37:27.099
So, does that mean
that people are bringing

37:27.099 --> 37:29.000
small boats into the swamp?

37:29.000 --> 37:30.330
This may lend

37:30.330 --> 37:32.330
a little bit more credibility

37:32.330 --> 37:33.594
to that story.

37:33.594 --> 37:35.396
NARRATOR:
A fragment of a bulkhead

37:35.396 --> 37:39.066
or cargo hold
from a small sailing vessel?

37:39.066 --> 37:43.363
And dating back
to as early as 1683?

37:43.363 --> 37:44.594
During the colonial period

37:44.594 --> 37:48.264
between the late 15th
and 18th centuries,

37:48.264 --> 37:49.726
massive sailing vessels

37:49.726 --> 37:51.528
that were too big
to be docked at shore

37:51.528 --> 37:54.264
were often anchored
in deeper waters

37:54.264 --> 37:56.264
as smaller boats were utilized

37:56.264 --> 37:59.000
to carry cargo
to shipping wharfs.

37:59.000 --> 38:02.099
Since the team
has unearthed the stone wharf

38:02.099 --> 38:04.132
in the southeast corner
of the swamp,

38:04.132 --> 38:07.066
could Doug and Dr. Spooner
be correct

38:07.066 --> 38:09.132
that this artifact is evidence

38:09.132 --> 38:11.198
of such an operation
being conducted

38:11.198 --> 38:14.264
in the 17th century
on Oak Island?

38:14.264 --> 38:19.066
\hThe dates that seem to be
relevant more and more are

38:19.066 --> 38:21.396
mid-1600s to the late 1600s.

38:21.396 --> 38:25.198
Human beings were at that level
doing some work,

38:25.198 --> 38:27.726
some endeavor to hide something,

38:27.726 --> 38:30.198
save something, store something.

38:30.198 --> 38:35.000
I believe we must continue
to do the work necessary

38:35.000 --> 38:37.396
to come
to a further understanding

38:37.396 --> 38:38.495
of what the swamp can tell us

38:38.495 --> 38:43.198
in terms of what the original
depositional work was.

38:43.198 --> 38:44.726
How about the other one?

38:44.726 --> 38:47.198
The second sample,
I’ve never seen that before.

38:47.198 --> 38:48.099
I don’t know what it is.

38:48.099 --> 38:49.528
-But there’s a rope burn on it.
-SCOTT: Yeah.

38:49.528 --> 38:52.330
-RICK: Mm-hmm.
-IAN: So, again, we have

38:52.330 --> 38:55.726
dates that range
from 1680 to 1740.

38:55.726 --> 38:57.099
RICK:
Hmm. Interesting.

38:57.099 --> 39:02.000
IAN:
I’d say that those two
are very, very similar age

39:02.000 --> 39:04.396
but pre-searcher.

39:04.396 --> 39:06.264
Oh, absolutely.

39:06.462 --> 39:08.396
So, that’s sort of where
my story ends.

39:08.396 --> 39:11.363
The swamp
is still a very important place.

39:11.363 --> 39:14.495
I know we’ve done
a lot of looking and searching,

39:14.495 --> 39:17.759
\hbut there’s still areas that we
haven’t really touched too much.

39:17.759 --> 39:21.396
Well, for my part,
the dates are wonderful.

39:21.396 --> 39:24.330
They raise
all kinds of possibilities.

39:24.330 --> 39:26.396
And, okay,
there was a lot of activity

39:26.396 --> 39:28.726
between 1680 and 1750.

39:28.726 --> 39:30.660
Well, who were those people?

39:30.660 --> 39:33.264
Were they here looking
for something themselves?

39:33.264 --> 39:35.726
Or were they depositing,

39:35.726 --> 39:38.198
which would be more exciting?

39:38.198 --> 39:41.528
The swamp is more of a mystery
than it’s ever been.

39:41.528 --> 39:44.594
We found all kinds of things
that seem out of place

39:44.594 --> 39:46.528
and several pieces of wood

39:46.528 --> 39:49.528
that could have been used
on a ship.

39:49.528 --> 39:51.198
Now we have hard science

39:51.198 --> 39:53.198
from
many different methodologies

39:53.198 --> 39:57.726
that something significant
happened here in the late 1600s.

39:57.726 --> 40:01.660
The swamp continues,
really, to be enigmatic

40:01.660 --> 40:03.594
and a real puzzle.

40:03.594 --> 40:05.264
How about you, Rick?

40:05.264 --> 40:06.726
RICK:
Mine is simply this:

40:06.726 --> 40:11.066
that, you know, you’re
always looking for science

40:11.066 --> 40:13.330
to provide overlap information,

40:13.330 --> 40:16.132
and I think
we have it here today.

40:16.528 --> 40:18.231
I think these dates are

40:18.231 --> 40:19.660
interesting evidence
of activity,

40:19.660 --> 40:23.132
-but I-I want to know the why,
obviously.
-IAN: I do, too.

40:23.132 --> 40:25.660
So, that’s where I’m at.

40:25.660 --> 40:27.231
But we have to take every lesson

40:27.231 --> 40:29.660
\hwe learn in this room
and apply it out back,

40:29.660 --> 40:31.528
you know,
with the eyes and boots.

40:31.528 --> 40:35.462
This has been very informative
and-and, uh, and enlightening,

40:35.462 --> 40:38.363
so we appreciate it, certainly.

40:38.363 --> 40:39.330
Good.

40:39.330 --> 40:40.660
-MARTY: Works for me.
-RICK: Okay.

40:40.660 --> 40:43.528
-CRAIG: See you later.
-MARTY: See you the next time.

40:43.528 --> 40:47.528
NARRATOR:
At the close
of another incredible week,

40:47.528 --> 40:49.528
Rick, Marty,
Craig and their team

40:49.528 --> 40:51.726
have more scientific evidence

40:51.726 --> 40:54.330
that something
of great importance took place

40:54.330 --> 40:59.000
on Oak Island long before
the discovery of the Money Pit.

40:59.264 --> 41:01.594
But perhaps more importantly,

41:01.594 --> 41:04.330
they have evidence
that something

41:04.330 --> 41:06.528
so valuable was brought here,

41:06.528 --> 41:09.330
it inspired
the creation of a swamp

41:09.330 --> 41:10.330
to hide the evidence

41:10.330 --> 41:14.066
and a burial site
so ingeniously engineered

41:14.066 --> 41:19.066
that it has eluded seekers
for more than two centuries.

41:19.066 --> 41:21.132
The question now is

41:21.132 --> 41:23.528
how much longer
can it elude Rick,

41:23.528 --> 41:28.363
Marty
and the Fellowship of the Dig?

41:31.264 --> 41:34.132
\hNext time on
The Curse of Oak Island...

41:34.132 --> 41:37.396
-TERRY: Today could be the day.
-CHARLES: We got a core.

41:38.000 --> 41:39.528
GARY:
Oh, man. That’s cool.

41:39.528 --> 41:42.198
DAVID F.:
Were there certain boxes
that would have that type

41:42.198 --> 41:44.660
\h-of sheeting on it?
-Only for valuables.

41:44.660 --> 41:46.594
-Gary, what do you make of this?
-Oh, yeah.

41:46.594 --> 41:48.759
We’re looking for a ship.
That’s the type of find

41:48.759 --> 41:51.528
-you want to be pulling up.
\h-CLARKE: We know

41:51.528 --> 41:53.363
that Phips found silver
on the Concepción,

41:53.363 --> 41:54.330
and I believe

41:54.330 --> 41:56.198
some of the treasure
\hfrom the Concepción

41:56.198 --> 41:58.132
-was secreted to Oak Island.
-Wow.

41:58.132 --> 41:59.594
That is remarkable.
