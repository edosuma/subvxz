03:36.790 --> 03:40.223
- Contract 7510 for
three names, Dr. Marinus.

03:42.940 --> 03:46.020
- One of us must have
problems with our memory.

03:46.020 --> 03:49.923
I remember only two names were agreed.

03:50.780 --> 03:51.773
- He's your third.

04:01.831 --> 04:04.248
- I'm, I'm sorry, my friend.

04:06.100 --> 04:07.940
We've both made a mistake.

04:07.940 --> 04:09.540
- He was on the last three missions.

04:09.540 --> 04:12.633
He remembers the last one
and he remembers you as well.

04:16.835 --> 04:18.640
- How come Yuri's in London?

04:20.760 --> 04:21.593
He's Russian.

04:22.680 --> 04:24.900
He lives in Russia.

04:24.900 --> 04:27.030
And if we have a situation,

04:27.030 --> 04:30.439
then our Russian team
will have to handle it.

04:30.439 --> 04:34.120
So why the fuck did you bring him here?

04:34.120 --> 04:36.370
- He's a big name, he's also black.

04:36.370 --> 04:38.080
A black guy in a Russian town

04:38.080 --> 04:39.620
would attract too much attention.

04:39.620 --> 04:41.723
So we put him on the list.

04:44.041 --> 04:45.741
Is he still in training?

04:47.430 --> 04:50.584
- Used up on the way here. He's sleeping.

04:50.584 --> 04:51.834
- Oh, amateurs.

04:54.210 --> 04:55.971
What if he wakes up?

04:55.971 --> 04:58.633
here with us?

05:00.010 --> 05:01.980
- After you keep them
awake all the time, Mr. Ma-

05:01.980 --> 05:03.953
- Dr. Marinus.

05:05.690 --> 05:08.573
By creating exciting situations.

05:09.760 --> 05:13.533
We call it training situations.

05:14.620 --> 05:17.953
They don't make any sense but
it keeps the senses alive.

05:20.210 --> 05:22.033
Allows them to feel the water.

05:23.810 --> 05:25.823
Hear the sound of the street.

05:27.930 --> 05:31.013
Or even just the smoke of a cigarette.

05:37.760 --> 05:39.410
And then the brain does the rest.

05:45.057 --> 05:48.880
How quickly do you need it?

05:48.880 --> 05:50.880
Oh, I don't even have to heroes.

05:50.880 --> 05:54.767
I have one I'm seeing later.

05:54.767 --> 05:57.973
His mind is weak but stable.

05:59.170 --> 06:01.060
I had one but I don't
have an option right here.

06:01.060 --> 06:03.230
- Our colleagues in the East have someone.

06:03.230 --> 06:05.403
They'll send them to
the facility directly.

06:06.270 --> 06:08.990
- Without my first interview and approval?

06:08.990 --> 06:12.053
- Urgent situations need urgent solutions.

06:20.210 --> 06:23.650
- Ah, send Yuri to the facility.

06:23.650 --> 06:24.483
Peacefully.

06:26.940 --> 06:27.773
Quietly.

06:32.210 --> 06:35.370
Use your time and watch me working.

06:35.370 --> 06:37.818
And then maybe you can take some knowledge

06:43.490 --> 06:44.441
And next time

06:47.480 --> 06:48.780
don't bring any surprises.

08:19.891 --> 08:21.782
Are you okay?

08:41.784 --> 08:46.784
Thank you.

08:48.810 --> 08:50.070
Are you-
- My name

08:50.070 --> 08:52.680
is Dr. Daniel Marinus.

08:52.680 --> 08:55.133
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Cooper.

08:56.740 --> 08:57.640
- Nice to meet you

08:58.500 --> 08:59.333
- Please.

09:02.292 --> 09:07.080
Uh, I, I have your DNA
test results here with-

09:07.080 --> 09:08.360
- Yeah, about that

09:08.360 --> 09:11.270
Why did the laboratory share
that information with you?

09:11.270 --> 09:14.230
And why do you have those before I do?

09:14.230 --> 09:15.990
- All the data is the
property of the company.

09:15.990 --> 09:18.980
They can share it with whomever they want.

09:18.980 --> 09:21.823
You should read what
you sign more carefully.

09:23.440 --> 09:24.640
- Thanks for the advice.

09:25.610 --> 09:27.170
Can I have my results?
- I have a couple

09:27.170 --> 09:28.090
of questions first.

09:28.090 --> 09:31.340
The information that you provided us with

09:31.340 --> 09:34.503
to start the research is less than ideal.

09:36.350 --> 09:37.890
- And why is that a concern?

09:37.890 --> 09:39.910
- Mm, it's peculiar in this day and age

09:39.910 --> 09:43.027
not to have more information
about your background.

09:43.027 --> 09:43.970
- I thought the point of this service

09:43.970 --> 09:46.023
is to discover your background.

09:47.470 --> 09:49.680
- Um, you...

09:49.680 --> 09:51.413
You're a postman, right?

09:52.560 --> 09:53.660
What'd your mother do?

09:55.620 --> 09:57.350
- Why does that matter?
- I don't have time

09:57.350 --> 09:59.700
to explain my research to you, Mr. Cooper.

09:59.700 --> 10:03.080
Everything would go so much
easier if you were to cooperate.

10:03.080 --> 10:04.590
- I don't have to be here, you know.

10:04.590 --> 10:06.640
- You do if you want to see your results.

10:07.870 --> 10:09.880
- I'm sure a lawyer would disagree.

10:09.880 --> 10:11.880
- I'm sure I can afford a better lawyer.

10:15.770 --> 10:18.430
- My mother worked too many
jobs for me to keep track.

10:18.430 --> 10:19.967
She's a single mother and all that.

10:19.967 --> 10:22.460
- Ah, do you have any other
information about her life?

10:22.460 --> 10:24.460
Where she lived before?

10:24.460 --> 10:26.300
Would you consider asking her?

10:26.300 --> 10:28.230
- If I had any more
information on my mother,

10:28.230 --> 10:30.730
I wouldn't bother with
any of this bullshit.

10:30.730 --> 10:32.480
- Would you mind asking your mother

10:32.480 --> 10:34.333
if she wouldn't mind coming here?

10:36.030 --> 10:38.760
- My mother doesn't even know I'm here.

10:38.760 --> 10:40.660
And she wouldn't be happy if she knew.

10:43.480 --> 10:46.830
- Maybe I could ask your mother to come.

10:50.610 --> 10:51.508
- Excuse me?

10:53.340 --> 10:55.950
- Maybe she doesn't remember
where you come from.

10:55.950 --> 10:56.813
I know the type.

10:57.730 --> 11:00.570
Doesn't remember who
she was with last night.

11:00.570 --> 11:02.240
- With all due respect, Mr. Ma-

11:02.240 --> 11:03.073
- Doctor!

11:09.310 --> 11:11.390
- I think we're done here.

11:11.390 --> 11:13.040
If you aren't gonna give me my results,

11:13.040 --> 11:14.810
I'd like my money back.
- I'm sure that

11:14.810 --> 11:15.683
isn't necessary.

11:16.800 --> 11:19.300
I don't think you're quite
what we're looking for.

11:21.769 --> 11:23.053
Goodbye.

11:39.580 --> 11:41.663
Ah, he responded as expected.

11:43.067 --> 11:43.922
Follow him.

11:46.662 --> 11:48.003
What the hell was that?

11:49.650 --> 11:51.030
Why does that weirdo want to know

11:51.030 --> 11:53.113
anything about my mother?

11:54.840 --> 11:57.803
She hasn't left the sanitarium
since Dad went on the run.

11:59.510 --> 12:00.363
No explanation.

12:01.520 --> 12:02.353
No letter.

12:03.357 --> 12:05.823
He vanishes and she goes insane.

12:09.310 --> 12:10.403
What is it about me?

12:12.060 --> 12:14.053
Why do I always attract the lunatics?

12:17.000 --> 12:17.833
Lunatic or not,

12:18.990 --> 12:20.290
that guy seemed important.

12:21.980 --> 12:23.330
What does he know about me?

12:24.610 --> 12:25.833
Why am I special?

12:28.400 --> 12:29.233
What's this?

13:48.750 --> 13:52.010
Hey.
- Andrew, I was so worried.

13:52.010 --> 13:54.180
- Sorry, Mom. I was, I was a bit busy.

13:54.180 --> 13:55.380
What happened?

13:57.951 --> 13:59.310
- I was, um...

14:01.011 --> 14:03.340
I was looking
into this whole DNA thing.

14:03.340 --> 14:05.850
It sounds like a-
- Andrew,

14:05.850 --> 14:08.010
you need to drop it.
- Mom,

14:08.010 --> 14:10.970
they didn't find anyone
even remotely related to me.

14:10.970 --> 14:13.370
Someone somewhere should have
done this DNA thing by now.

14:13.370 --> 14:15.375
I think something happened to them.

14:15.375 --> 14:17.458
Don't be silly.

14:20.210 --> 14:23.120
- Mom, do you know something?

14:23.120 --> 14:25.470
There's nothing to know, Andy.

14:25.470 --> 14:28.230
My family doesn't want to speak to me.

14:28.230 --> 14:30.840
It's just you and me.

14:30.840 --> 14:33.740
- You're lying.
- Andrew.

14:33.740 --> 14:36.773
What has gotten into you?
- It's just this test, Mom.

14:38.502 --> 14:40.440
I wanted to know who I am.

14:40.440 --> 14:42.180
You don't need a city test

14:42.180 --> 14:43.380
to tell you who you are.

14:45.440 --> 14:46.273
- I know.

14:48.660 --> 14:49.493
I'm sorry, Mom.

14:50.810 --> 14:52.810
Promise me you will drop this.

15:01.350 --> 15:02.200
- I promise, Mom.

15:04.690 --> 15:07.553
Look, Mom, I have to go. I
have an early rise tomorrow.

17:59.817 --> 18:01.413
Listen, doctor.

18:01.413 --> 18:02.570
I don't know what scam you're pulling,

18:02.570 --> 18:03.507
but if you come near-

18:30.412 --> 18:32.085
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.

18:32.085 --> 18:33.175
That wasn't me.

18:33.175 --> 18:34.008
I'm sorry.

18:40.318 --> 18:41.930
I am, sir, this isn't me!

18:48.474 --> 18:51.028
I'm so sorry about this!

18:51.028 --> 18:52.695
- Guys, fair enough.

18:57.480 --> 18:59.830
How are you feeling, Mr. Cooper?

18:59.830 --> 19:02.720
- I have no idea why
you're so interested in me.

19:02.720 --> 19:05.550
- I'm sure you're slowly
starting to realize why.

19:05.550 --> 19:07.500
- I have no idea how I did any of that.

19:08.649 --> 19:10.060
I'm so sorry about your muscle.

19:10.060 --> 19:12.720
I swear I'll stand out
of your way from now on.

19:12.720 --> 19:14.830
- We wouldn't want that, would we?

19:16.943 --> 19:18.590
- Listen, I-
- We flagged

19:18.590 --> 19:22.433
certain characteristics
in your DNA profile.

19:23.450 --> 19:25.883
We wanted and we needed to be sure.

19:27.488 --> 19:29.330
- Are you sure that-
- That you

19:29.330 --> 19:31.660
are special, Andrew

19:32.560 --> 19:36.580
This is designed to
reveal certain qualities

19:36.580 --> 19:38.240
in people like you.

19:38.240 --> 19:39.690
- How does it work?
- I'm afraid I can't

19:39.690 --> 19:40.780
give you that kind of information

19:40.780 --> 19:43.386
unless you're prepared
to join the program.

19:43.386 --> 19:44.960
But I have good news.

19:44.960 --> 19:46.860
Your application has been fast-forwarded.

19:46.860 --> 19:50.370
No time for frivolities. We leave now.

19:50.370 --> 19:53.069
- I'm not going.
- I'm afraid I don't believe

19:53.069 --> 19:54.924
you have any choice.

20:13.390 --> 20:15.690
You can drop me off at the office.

20:15.690 --> 20:17.250
- What about me?
- Ernesto will take

20:17.250 --> 20:18.925
very good car of you.

20:20.793 --> 20:22.893
It's a pity you've decided not to join us.

20:23.812 --> 20:25.110
I was still thinking.

20:28.860 --> 20:31.180
Don't be surprised, Mr. Cooper.

20:31.180 --> 20:33.940
I told you, you're very special.

20:33.940 --> 20:35.964
We can't afford to lose you.

20:35.964 --> 20:37.920
- Well, what about my mother?

20:37.920 --> 20:39.850
- I can personally assure
you that your mother

20:39.850 --> 20:41.257
will be safe and secure.

20:54.038 --> 20:55.788
- Where are we going?

20:56.883 --> 20:58.694
And who were those people following me?

21:04.738 --> 21:06.320
He doesn't tell you anything, does he?

21:06.320 --> 21:08.873
You have the world's worst job, mate.

23:11.266 --> 23:13.210
- Good evening, Andrew.

23:13.210 --> 23:14.083
My name's Nadia.

23:15.800 --> 23:16.633
Come in.

23:18.203 --> 23:19.297
- Not sure I want to.

23:20.193 --> 23:21.360
- Why is that?

23:23.788 --> 23:26.318
- I have no idea what this place is,

23:26.318 --> 23:28.720
who you people are or
what you want from me.

23:28.720 --> 23:30.393
- This is a research facility.

23:33.460 --> 23:36.829
I'm responsible for the
smooth running of the facility

23:36.829 --> 23:37.662
and you...

23:43.288 --> 23:45.538
You're hear to participate.

23:46.607 --> 23:49.050
- What if I don't want to?

23:49.050 --> 23:50.450
- No one's holding you here.

23:51.400 --> 23:54.580
But if you do leave now,
there'll be no more help from us.

23:54.580 --> 23:56.180
You'll be left completely alone.

23:57.890 --> 24:00.560
- Will the men in black
leave me alone too?

24:00.560 --> 24:01.977
- Most definitely not.

24:07.291 --> 24:08.124
- Mom.

24:11.768 --> 24:13.425
It's okay, Mom. Listen, listen.

24:13.425 --> 24:16.070
You just have to go with them, okay?

24:16.070 --> 24:19.059
Some men came after me. I don't know who.

24:19.059 --> 24:19.892
Mom.

24:20.757 --> 24:21.590
Mom?

24:24.351 --> 24:25.305
Mom?

24:25.305 --> 24:27.210
- I'm going to need that.

24:27.210 --> 24:28.510
- What happened to my mom?

24:29.570 --> 24:32.170
- Dr. Marinus will take good care of her.

24:32.170 --> 24:34.710
She'll be able to call you
when she's in a safe place.

24:34.710 --> 24:37.060
- I'm not going anywhere
until I hear from her.

24:37.980 --> 24:38.813
- Suit yourself.

24:39.799 --> 24:41.330
I hope you brought a tent.

24:41.330 --> 24:42.830
It's supposed to rain tonight.

25:05.250 --> 25:07.010
Shaan, are you okay?
- Hey, my wife said

25:07.010 --> 25:09.050
that she can't reach
the rest of the family.

25:09.050 --> 25:10.570
- I know, Shaan. It's a tricky situation.

25:10.570 --> 25:12.540
- Now what will these people do with them

25:12.540 --> 25:13.590
when they find them?

25:13.590 --> 25:15.462
- It's hard to test. Your
children haven't been tested.

25:15.462 --> 25:16.493
- Are you trying to suggest that I should

25:16.493 --> 25:19.120
bring my kids here?
- No, of course not.

25:19.120 --> 25:20.450
Not yet.

25:20.450 --> 25:22.740
The best thing for you to do
is go through with the training

25:22.740 --> 25:23.710
and get stronger.

25:23.710 --> 25:24.960
Your children are safe.

25:24.960 --> 25:26.410
That's all we can do for now.

25:27.930 --> 25:29.210
Andrew.

25:29.210 --> 25:31.600
I'm so glad you changed your mind.

25:31.600 --> 25:32.919
Please go back to your room.

25:32.919 --> 25:34.836
I'll talk to you later.

25:36.150 --> 25:36.983
Follow me.

25:48.850 --> 25:49.683
Let's start.

25:54.150 --> 25:56.623
I need you to sign this.

26:00.310 --> 26:01.800
- What is it?

26:01.800 --> 26:03.800
- It's in case something happens to you.

26:04.800 --> 26:05.993
It's normal procedure.

26:11.283 --> 26:12.116
- Fine.

26:19.200 --> 26:20.770
Where's my mother?

26:20.770 --> 26:23.190
- Your mother is safe.
That's all I can tell you.

26:23.190 --> 26:26.480
- Another question-
- To more pressing issues.

26:26.480 --> 26:27.613
I need your phone.

26:28.960 --> 26:30.223
It's too easy to track.

26:39.960 --> 26:40.793
Good.

26:43.055 --> 26:44.191
Now...

26:46.210 --> 26:47.683
One last thing.

27:00.220 --> 27:01.650
You'll stay here.

27:01.650 --> 27:04.023
Someone will come and get
you when the dinner's ready.

27:42.855 --> 27:44.272
Andrew.

28:26.390 --> 28:27.223
- Hello?

28:52.246 --> 28:53.079
Mom.

28:56.389 --> 28:57.491
- Hey-
- Oh!

28:57.491 --> 28:58.829
What the?

28:58.829 --> 28:59.880
I, uh-
- Do you know what?

28:59.880 --> 29:01.640
I don't care. Nadia sent me.

29:01.640 --> 29:02.973
Dinner's ready. Let's go.

29:27.370 --> 29:28.203
He was upstairs.

29:29.330 --> 29:31.280
- What were you doing up there, Andrew?

29:31.280 --> 29:32.519
- I got lost.

29:35.400 --> 29:37.993
- What are you waiting for? Come eat.

29:43.210 --> 29:44.850
- Yeah.

29:44.850 --> 29:46.570
Hey, where's Dr. Marinus?

29:46.570 --> 29:48.850
I need to ask him a couple of questions.

29:48.850 --> 29:50.860
- He won't be available for a while.

29:50.860 --> 29:52.340
He's looking for others.

29:52.340 --> 29:53.313
- What others?

29:54.430 --> 29:56.830
- We'll get to the details later.

29:56.830 --> 29:59.740
- It's always later with
you people, isn't it?

29:59.740 --> 30:03.330
- I told you, all you get out
of this mysterious bullshit

30:03.330 --> 30:04.623
is people getting pissed.

30:07.210 --> 30:10.780
- Fine. What do you want to know?

30:10.780 --> 30:13.140
- Well, who are these people?

30:13.140 --> 30:15.800
- These people are the same as you,

30:15.800 --> 30:17.140
participants in the research

30:17.140 --> 30:18.640
we're conducting in this facility.

30:18.640 --> 30:20.640
- Does that mean you're gonna
conduct experiments on us?

30:20.640 --> 30:22.040
- Oh yes, she will.

30:22.040 --> 30:24.523
And she got pretty good at
it since we've got here too.

30:25.380 --> 30:26.213
- We?

30:27.630 --> 30:30.330
- My brother and I got
here the same way you did.

30:30.330 --> 30:31.990
Dr. Marinus brought us here.

30:31.990 --> 30:35.800
- Brother?
- Our parents adopted us.

30:35.800 --> 30:37.840
They were scientists from Russia.

30:37.840 --> 30:39.030
Unfortunately they decided to look

30:39.030 --> 30:40.923
into the same topic as Dr. Marinus.

30:41.780 --> 30:43.560
- We didn't know what to do.

30:43.560 --> 30:46.260
Before we knew it, half
the world was chasing us.

30:46.260 --> 30:47.200
If we was a foreign nester,

30:47.200 --> 30:49.210
we wouldn't have made it out here alive.

30:49.210 --> 30:50.860
- Our parents weren't that lucky.

30:53.890 --> 30:56.073
- So if you both got
here at the same time,

30:57.700 --> 30:59.100
how was it that you're in charge,

30:59.100 --> 31:00.910
and he's just like one of us?

31:00.910 --> 31:03.120
- I'm 15. Come on, man

31:03.120 --> 31:05.780
- There's no point in me
participating in the research.

31:05.780 --> 31:08.236
We found the limits of
my abilities very soon.

31:08.236 --> 31:09.700
- Abilities?

31:09.700 --> 31:12.010
- Dr. Marinus is continuing
the lifetime works

31:12.010 --> 31:15.180
of his mother and grandfather
into sensory receptors.

31:15.180 --> 31:17.260
The research started decades ago

31:17.260 --> 31:19.580
with a couple of conjoined twins.

31:19.580 --> 31:21.970
The way their brains
developed influenced the way

31:21.970 --> 31:24.633
their sensory receptors
received information.

31:26.310 --> 31:27.790
- In what way?

31:27.790 --> 31:29.763
- They were able to
recognize the information

31:29.763 --> 31:32.420
that other twins receptors were receiving

31:32.420 --> 31:34.083
without the appropriate stimuli.

31:35.250 --> 31:36.833
- What sort of information?

31:37.712 --> 31:39.350
- Little things at first.

31:39.350 --> 31:41.310
If one was eating or drinking,

31:41.310 --> 31:43.750
the other could taste it, for example.

31:43.750 --> 31:45.800
After decades of research, Dr. Marinus

31:45.800 --> 31:47.660
is capable of much more.

31:47.660 --> 31:49.290
- Like what?

31:49.290 --> 31:51.450
- He identified the gene responsible

31:51.450 --> 31:53.740
and the way it needs to be
altered for the individual

31:53.740 --> 31:56.670
to be capable of these
types of communication.

31:56.670 --> 31:58.420
That's how he was able to find you.

31:59.720 --> 32:01.017
- Are you saying that we-

32:01.017 --> 32:03.730
- Dr. Marinus has proven that all of you

32:03.730 --> 32:06.210
have above average abilities.

32:06.210 --> 32:08.840
- What kinds of abilities
are these exactly?

32:08.840 --> 32:13.840
- Your senses, sight,
taste, smell, hearing.

32:14.300 --> 32:15.943
We're all capable of
receiving more information

32:15.943 --> 32:17.630
than other people.

32:17.630 --> 32:19.623
And other things with training.

32:22.790 --> 32:24.090
- So can you explain to me

32:24.950 --> 32:27.900
why it was worth breaking into my home

32:27.900 --> 32:30.550
and trying to kidnap me and my family?

32:30.550 --> 32:33.250
- And what's going on with
the Agent Smiths out there?

33:02.930 --> 33:04.430
- Stick these on your temples.

33:13.370 --> 33:15.926
Yuri, would you please place
your hand on the table?

33:23.090 --> 33:24.590
See right now,

33:24.590 --> 33:26.329
I can see that your eyes have told you

33:26.329 --> 33:28.582
something dangerous is about to happen.

33:38.240 --> 33:40.790
See your brain reacted at least partially

33:40.790 --> 33:42.710
in a way that suggested
it was your own hand

33:42.710 --> 33:43.593
that got stabbed.

33:44.730 --> 33:46.790
As I said earlier, if
I'm able to influence

33:46.790 --> 33:48.730
what you think you are seeing,

33:48.730 --> 33:50.743
I'm able to influence your reactions.

33:52.430 --> 33:54.670
- And you think we can
do something like this?

33:54.670 --> 33:55.620
- Not yet.

33:55.620 --> 33:57.860
There are a couple of steps before that.

33:57.860 --> 34:00.000
First you need to unlock your receptors.

34:00.000 --> 34:03.150
Then you need to learn how
to receive information.

34:03.150 --> 34:05.250
And then maybe you'll be able to send some

34:06.920 --> 34:08.143
after a lot of training.

34:16.880 --> 34:19.107
You're late.
- No kidding.

34:19.107 --> 34:20.980
This place is like a maze.

34:20.980 --> 34:22.330
How can you even afford it?

34:23.180 --> 34:25.550
- While the others continue
with their given tasks,

34:25.550 --> 34:27.380
let me introduce you to the procedures

34:27.380 --> 34:29.990
you're going to go
through in this training.

34:29.990 --> 34:33.610
The first step is always
localization and identification

34:33.610 --> 34:35.230
which has already been
done by one of my agents

34:35.230 --> 34:37.710
in the field.
- What do you mean?

34:37.710 --> 34:39.393
- This may look familiar to you.

34:41.180 --> 34:44.305
There is another thing you
would have experienced.

34:46.280 --> 34:50.553
- Darling, you know I hate
it when you call me a thing.

34:54.678 --> 34:55.853
You were very far away.

34:56.900 --> 34:58.500
We needed to keep an eye on you.

34:59.900 --> 35:01.460
If you were any weaker, the agents

35:01.460 --> 35:03.060
would have been able to find you

35:03.970 --> 35:05.870
- Shall we start with the training?

35:05.870 --> 35:06.703
- Very well.

35:08.160 --> 35:09.430
Now that you're here and safe,

35:09.430 --> 35:11.460
we can start working on your abilities

35:11.460 --> 35:12.890
without the risk of becoming game

35:12.890 --> 35:15.350
to a group of highly
dangerous individuals.

35:15.350 --> 35:16.600
- Can you guarantee that?

35:19.603 --> 35:21.440
- I'm very happy to see you, Andrew.

35:24.060 --> 35:26.141
Now let me show you something.

35:38.940 --> 35:41.160
Your sensory receptors
are currently receiving

35:41.160 --> 35:43.783
information that I have
chosen for them to receive.

35:44.730 --> 35:46.623
None of this is real.

35:47.900 --> 35:50.243
I've created this situation for you.

35:52.830 --> 35:54.260
During your training,

35:54.260 --> 35:57.030
you must learn to recognize what is real

35:57.030 --> 35:59.930
and what I have chosen
for you to see or to feel.

36:02.428 --> 36:03.928
- Crazy, isn't it?

36:08.253 --> 36:10.342
- What do you expect me to do?

36:10.342 --> 36:12.533
Everything seems so real.

36:12.533 --> 36:15.270
- I know but it's crucial
that you train your senses

36:15.270 --> 36:16.793
to realize that it's not.

36:21.190 --> 36:23.030
- What do you usually do?

36:23.030 --> 36:24.780
- Everyone has a different process.

36:26.460 --> 36:29.220
- And everyone has a different test.

36:29.220 --> 36:32.020
You need to overcome what
your senses are telling you

36:32.020 --> 36:34.693
and focus on things that I can't cheat.

36:35.590 --> 36:37.083
Use your intuition.

36:38.810 --> 36:39.643
- That too.

36:53.316 --> 36:54.693
- Rebecca?

36:54.693 --> 36:56.413
- And you're Andrew, right?

36:59.120 --> 37:00.960
- Congratulations, Andrew.

37:00.960 --> 37:03.166
You've used your intuition.

37:03.166 --> 37:04.425
What?

37:04.425 --> 37:07.533
- Hey, what the fuck is this shit?

37:09.030 --> 37:10.140
What's going on?

37:10.140 --> 37:11.370
Hey, hey, hey, no. Fuck you, man.

37:11.370 --> 37:12.753
Leave me alone. Get away from me.

37:12.753 --> 37:14.892
Seriously, dude. Literally.

37:14.892 --> 37:15.956
- He's-
- No, no,

37:15.956 --> 37:17.766
none of this is real.

37:17.766 --> 37:18.599
- I think he's gonna throw him!

37:18.599 --> 37:20.168
- No, he can't get hurt.

37:22.349 --> 37:24.001
- No, no, leave me alone, man!

37:24.001 --> 37:25.883
- Shaan, calm down.
- I'll fuck you up!

37:25.883 --> 37:28.444
No, dude, please! Leave, leave me alone!

37:31.710 --> 37:32.933
- Ernesto, thank you.

37:40.951 --> 37:42.603
I think it's
time we took a break.

37:52.700 --> 37:53.800
Is he hurt?

37:54.700 --> 37:56.248
- Shaan is perfectly okay.

37:57.500 --> 38:00.970
The sedative is specifically
designed for these occasions.

38:00.970 --> 38:02.900
It's a normal part of the training.

38:02.900 --> 38:04.353
- Are you absolutely sure?

38:05.610 --> 38:06.860
- I spoke to Dr. Marinus.

38:08.210 --> 38:09.253
- Why isn't he here?

38:10.344 --> 38:12.944
- There are other issues
he's dealing with.

38:12.944 --> 38:15.694
All of you have proven to
have above average abilities.

38:17.470 --> 38:20.284
How many other 20-year-olds
run their kitchen like yours?

38:20.284 --> 38:21.900
- I don't know.

38:21.900 --> 38:25.433
- I've personally seen you
grocery shop by smell alone.

38:26.790 --> 38:28.250
- Is this a trick of the trade?

38:28.250 --> 38:29.890
- No, it's not.

38:29.890 --> 38:31.710
Your sense in smell
are extremely sensitive

38:31.710 --> 38:32.970
because your sensory receptors

38:32.970 --> 38:34.520
are receiving more information.

38:36.080 --> 38:37.323
The music you play.

38:39.470 --> 38:41.193
- I just copy the videos, I watch.

38:42.410 --> 38:44.230
- You do know it takes people years

38:44.230 --> 38:45.480
to do what you do, right?

38:46.690 --> 38:48.490
It's the same for every one of you.

38:48.490 --> 38:52.100
All of you have one or more
senses developed already.

38:52.100 --> 38:54.721
What we need to do is help
you develop the others.

38:54.721 --> 38:59.560
No, I mean,
there must be another way.

38:59.560 --> 39:01.923
The trainings is just too intense.

39:02.840 --> 39:04.430
- There isn't.

39:04.430 --> 39:06.693
It's the training and a lot of practice.

39:07.552 --> 39:10.823
Your abilities are there
like lead in a pencil.

39:12.030 --> 39:13.860
The only way of getting them out

39:13.860 --> 39:15.517
is by sharpening the pencil.

39:46.090 --> 39:47.093
It's your mother.

39:51.570 --> 39:52.987
- Mom.

39:52.987 --> 39:55.500
Hi.

39:55.500 --> 39:56.393
Are you okay?

39:58.330 --> 40:01.060
I'm fine. I'm so sorry
I dragged us into this.

40:01.060 --> 40:02.003
I didn't mean to.

40:03.210 --> 40:04.043
Yeah.

40:05.637 --> 40:08.290
I'm fine.

40:08.290 --> 40:09.690
Are they taking care of you?

40:12.015 --> 40:13.449
Good.

40:13.449 --> 40:14.282
Good.

40:16.206 --> 40:19.887
Do you know, I was just about
to practice a little violin.

40:19.887 --> 40:23.426
Sure, of course.

40:23.426 --> 40:24.677
Of course.

40:26.620 --> 40:27.960
Can you hear me?

40:27.960 --> 40:29.407
Yes, dear, I can.

40:34.010 --> 40:35.400
I'll be fine.

40:35.400 --> 40:37.793
I'll just listen to Andrew for a while.

40:39.840 --> 40:42.000
- Mom? Are you still there?

40:42.000 --> 40:43.870
Yes, yes.

40:43.870 --> 40:47.210
The nice man who watches
me went for a cigarette.

40:47.210 --> 40:49.630
Is there anyone with you over there?

40:49.630 --> 40:51.457
- No, Mom. It's just me.

40:52.370 --> 40:55.080
Andrew, listen to me.

40:55.080 --> 40:56.459
You need to leave.

40:56.459 --> 40:58.420
- What?
- Right now.

40:58.420 --> 41:00.198
- Mom, do you know about this?

41:00.198 --> 41:02.484
Mom?

41:02.484 --> 41:04.099
Mom?

41:04.099 --> 41:04.932
Mom?

41:06.106 --> 41:06.939
Shit.

41:11.513 --> 41:12.346
Mom.

41:14.572 --> 41:15.900
- You are late for training.

41:15.900 --> 41:16.813
Give me the phone.

41:18.780 --> 41:20.200
Andrew.

41:20.200 --> 41:21.033
- Shut up.

41:22.210 --> 41:23.351
- Andrew, give it to me.

41:27.244 --> 41:29.167
- Where is my mother?

41:29.167 --> 41:31.499
- I, I don't know.

41:31.499 --> 41:33.119
- You do.

41:33.119 --> 41:35.589
Where is my mother? What happened to her?

41:35.589 --> 41:37.765
- Andrew, I don't know.
- Don't lie to me!

41:37.765 --> 41:38.722
- No!

41:46.149 --> 41:48.066
Where did my mother go?

41:50.276 --> 41:51.424
- Andrew.

41:51.424 --> 41:53.994
- Get my mom out of there!

41:53.994 --> 41:54.827
- Andrew.

41:58.340 --> 41:59.863
You are late for training.

42:16.680 --> 42:17.513
- Yeah, man, there's a reason
- Okay?

42:17.513 --> 42:19.860
for that, Yuri, it's because
Quinn has been trained.

42:19.860 --> 42:21.970
- I'm just saying after all this time,

42:21.970 --> 42:23.820
you should be at least better at this.

42:23.820 --> 42:25.550
- It's just sometimes, I don't
see the point of anything.

42:25.550 --> 42:27.720
- Hand to eye coordination.

42:27.720 --> 42:29.790
That's the obvious answer.

42:29.790 --> 42:30.923
- I understand that.

42:31.970 --> 42:33.143
That might be the only thing around here

42:33.143 --> 42:34.450
that I understand.

42:34.450 --> 42:37.210
- Still, one would think
after all this time

42:37.210 --> 42:38.590
she'd at least learn something.

42:38.590 --> 42:41.650
- Not everyone is excited
to be here like you are.

42:41.650 --> 42:43.300
Some of us had lives.

42:43.300 --> 42:44.640
- I had a life. I had a family.

42:44.640 --> 42:46.490
- Yeah, in the middle of Russia.

42:46.490 --> 42:47.400
And with your complexion,

42:47.400 --> 42:50.340
I'm sure everyone was really
excited to have you there.

42:50.340 --> 42:51.830
- How dare you?

42:51.830 --> 42:53.751
- That's enough.

42:53.751 --> 42:55.010
- What?

42:55.010 --> 42:56.610
I'm just saying Rebecca
sucks at everything.

42:56.610 --> 42:57.740
- Excuse me?
- Now what could

42:57.740 --> 42:59.620
have possibly gone wrong?

42:59.620 --> 43:01.530
- We've been training with Rebecca forever

43:01.530 --> 43:03.730
and she's still can't
remember the simplest moves.

43:03.730 --> 43:06.880
- Yeah and you can't tell boiled
potatoes and apples apart.

43:06.880 --> 43:08.622
Stop being an asshole.

43:09.950 --> 43:12.570
Maybe you should work on cooperation more.

43:12.570 --> 43:13.640
- Why?

43:13.640 --> 43:16.040
Why work incorporation
when we can work together?

43:16.040 --> 43:18.800
- There are a lot of
people out there after you.

43:18.800 --> 43:21.200
Who knows what they have ready for you.

43:21.200 --> 43:23.249
You need to be able to trust each other.

43:33.870 --> 43:34.833
Enjoy, everybody.

43:39.860 --> 43:40.693
Andrew.

43:44.210 --> 43:45.860
How are you finding the training?

43:47.650 --> 43:48.483
- It's great.

43:50.150 --> 43:51.460
- Are you sure?

43:51.460 --> 43:53.710
You seem a little distracted.

43:53.710 --> 43:55.200
- I'm great.

43:55.200 --> 43:56.033
- That's great.

43:57.410 --> 43:58.910
What did you tell your mother?

44:00.310 --> 44:01.143
- Nothing.

44:03.720 --> 44:04.620
- That's not true.

44:08.570 --> 44:11.810
- She wanted to tell me something

44:11.810 --> 44:12.983
when the line cut.

44:15.005 --> 44:16.990
- What could your mother possibly know?

44:16.990 --> 44:18.745
- You don't have to lie to me.

44:18.745 --> 44:19.578
I saw...

44:25.573 --> 44:27.053
DNA test results.

44:27.930 --> 44:30.500
And how else would you explain no matches?

44:30.500 --> 44:31.393
- What does that have
to do with your mother?

44:31.393 --> 44:33.243
- There's only one explanation.

44:34.170 --> 44:36.230
The agents got to them first.

44:36.230 --> 44:37.880
She was the only one who escaped.

44:39.190 --> 44:40.140
- I don't know about that.

44:40.140 --> 44:42.690
What I do know is Dr.
Marinus isn't gonna let you

44:42.690 --> 44:44.270
talk to your mother again soon.

44:44.270 --> 44:46.563
He was very angry.
- Is she in danger?

44:47.510 --> 44:48.343
- I don't know.

44:49.806 --> 44:51.470
I haven't been able to speak to him since.

44:51.470 --> 44:52.637
- What kind of place are you running here?

44:52.637 --> 44:54.687
- The kind of place that keeps you alive.

44:55.670 --> 44:58.960
Listen, Andrew, we need
to be very careful.

44:58.960 --> 45:02.180
You and everyone else
here including myself,

45:02.180 --> 45:03.680
can probably receive information

45:03.680 --> 45:06.010
through non-sensory communication.

45:06.010 --> 45:07.410
If someone with more practice

45:07.410 --> 45:09.580
and stronger abilities
got their hands on this-

45:09.580 --> 45:11.087
- Is there someone like that that?

45:11.087 --> 45:12.310
- There has to be.

45:12.310 --> 45:14.950
They've been doing this
research for decades.

45:14.950 --> 45:17.650
All the people Dr. Marinus couldn't save,

45:17.650 --> 45:19.014
they must have gone somewhere.

45:20.650 --> 45:23.040
- So?
- The aim of the training

45:23.040 --> 45:24.900
is not just to be able to receive

45:24.900 --> 45:26.853
but to be able to send information.

45:27.830 --> 45:28.930
If they knew about us,

45:30.982 --> 45:34.560
they could make us see and
hear things that weren't real.

45:34.560 --> 45:36.370
They'd have complete control over us

45:36.370 --> 45:37.670
and we wouldn't even know.

45:39.005 --> 45:41.660
We have to be careful.

45:41.660 --> 45:43.160
- I'll be careful.

45:44.439 --> 45:47.111
Can I go to bed now? I'm tired.

46:35.862 --> 46:37.174
- Guys.

46:37.174 --> 46:40.030
How long has it been since
you spoke to anyone outside?

46:40.030 --> 46:41.540
- It's been a while.

46:41.540 --> 46:42.760
My wife must be worried sick.

46:42.760 --> 46:45.500
- I haven't spoken to
anyone since Wednesday.

46:45.500 --> 46:47.560
- I tried calling my friend yesterday.

46:47.560 --> 46:49.660
She said someone else is using the phone.

46:49.660 --> 46:51.803
I tried again this morning. Same.

46:53.140 --> 46:57.673
- Guys, I think it might be my fault.

46:59.280 --> 47:01.121
I was talking to my mom and I-

47:01.121 --> 47:02.697
- What did you do?

47:02.697 --> 47:04.943
- She asked me if I was alone.

47:06.014 --> 47:07.941
And then she was trying to warn me.

47:07.941 --> 47:08.840
- What are you talking about?

47:08.840 --> 47:10.640
- Nadia said she's gonna fix the phones.

47:10.640 --> 47:11.770
It's gonna take a couple of days.

47:11.770 --> 47:13.364
- A couple of days? That's just great.

47:13.364 --> 47:15.030
That's just great.
- No, I didn't mean

47:15.030 --> 47:17.430
to cause trouble.

47:17.430 --> 47:20.600
It's my mom but I think
she might know something.

47:20.600 --> 47:21.433
- Why would you think that?
- She does?

47:21.433 --> 47:24.000
- Of course she doesn't.
She's just an old lady.

47:24.000 --> 47:25.100
- What did she say, Andrew?

47:25.100 --> 47:28.597
- I don't know. She was trying to...

47:28.597 --> 47:29.983
The call dropped.

47:31.080 --> 47:33.510
And I think she was telling me...

47:33.510 --> 47:36.250
I think she was trying to warn me.

47:36.250 --> 47:38.101
She was telling me to leave.

47:46.940 --> 47:49.337
- Are you ready for the
next part of your training?

48:05.214 --> 48:06.047
- Yuri.

48:07.945 --> 48:08.778
Yuri.

49:24.849 --> 49:27.174
Yuri, what's the code?

50:13.246 --> 50:14.079
- Ah!

50:16.103 --> 50:17.910
- Nadia will be very proud

50:17.910 --> 50:20.623
that you've taken this
cooperation exercise to heart.

50:21.790 --> 50:24.410
It was a beautiful cooperation

50:24.410 --> 50:28.112
between Andrew's
situation and Yuri's eyes.

50:42.510 --> 50:43.890
- Are you seeing this?

50:43.890 --> 50:45.680
- I prefer not to
interfere with the program

50:45.680 --> 50:46.703
as planned for you.

50:48.060 --> 50:51.360
- He was, he was gonna pull
the trigger or something.

50:51.360 --> 50:53.900
- Physical damage doesn't
happen quite as you would expect

50:53.900 --> 50:55.587
when creating these situations.

50:55.587 --> 50:57.330
- But he will get hurt, right?

50:57.330 --> 50:59.160
- Theoretically, it
depends on the individual

50:59.160 --> 51:01.270
creating the situation.

51:01.270 --> 51:03.680
May is strong, but she cannot create

51:03.680 --> 51:05.830
an experience strong
enough to cause death.

51:07.690 --> 51:09.540
- Is there someone stronger than May?

51:10.820 --> 51:12.360
- There might've been.

51:12.360 --> 51:14.480
The research records
weren't kept quite as well

51:14.480 --> 51:15.480
as I would've liked.

51:22.317 --> 51:24.550
Help me!
- Stop!

51:24.550 --> 51:27.383
Help!

51:29.310 --> 51:30.643
- Panic won't help.

51:32.289 --> 51:34.084
You need to remember
that this is a situation

51:34.084 --> 51:37.049
- Help me, please!
- we created for you.

51:37.049 --> 51:39.910
And you know how to make sense of it.

51:39.910 --> 51:42.289
Don't focus on that.

51:42.289 --> 51:44.652
You can't trust what your
senses are telling you.

51:47.638 --> 51:49.659
- What happened?

51:49.659 --> 51:52.252
- I've made it a little easier for you.

51:52.252 --> 51:53.156
Look around.

51:56.490 --> 51:57.460
- It's night.

51:57.460 --> 51:59.627
- No it's not. It's light.

52:01.670 --> 52:03.770
- Don't focus on that.

52:03.770 --> 52:06.075
Think about what brought you here.

52:28.986 --> 52:30.063
- Andrew.

52:30.063 --> 52:31.615
Andrew!

52:34.449 --> 52:35.473
- What happened?

52:36.350 --> 52:37.650
- Nothing happened, Nadia.

52:38.710 --> 52:39.763
Everyone is tired.

52:41.790 --> 52:44.837
- Go. Rest before dinner.

52:54.440 --> 52:55.873
These look strong.

52:56.890 --> 52:59.900
- You and I both know
how fast that can change.

52:59.900 --> 53:03.590
- He is just-
- He is just talented.

53:03.590 --> 53:06.010
- He's been here days. Not even a month.

53:06.010 --> 53:07.601
And he's already created

53:10.330 --> 53:11.163
that.

53:12.090 --> 53:12.940
- Are you scared?

53:14.704 --> 53:16.567
No. Not you.

53:17.572 --> 53:19.460
You're jealous.

53:19.460 --> 53:21.070
He struggled with a few hallucinations-

53:21.070 --> 53:23.120
- He doesn't know what he's doing.

53:23.120 --> 53:25.050
He's going to hurt someone.

53:25.050 --> 53:26.140
- He's not that good.

53:27.740 --> 53:30.790
- Dr. Marinus promised us we'd be safe.

53:30.790 --> 53:31.633
Yuri and I.

53:32.480 --> 53:35.423
Don't break that promise.

53:53.636 --> 53:54.469
- Hello?

53:57.953 --> 53:58.786
Where are...

54:11.128 --> 54:12.322
I'm coming!

54:12.322 --> 54:13.711
I'm coming! Hold on!

54:13.711 --> 54:15.340
Hurry, open, May!

54:15.340 --> 54:17.360
May, aw, Jesus!

54:17.360 --> 54:19.860
Open up, May! Open the window!

54:21.618 --> 54:23.451
Hold on! Hold on, May!

54:24.307 --> 54:25.557
May, step away!

54:36.476 --> 54:38.112
- That'd be a pass.

54:38.112 --> 54:39.936
Not a bad time, either.

54:54.710 --> 54:56.690
- Unbelievable, man. This is so unfair.

54:56.690 --> 54:58.380
So unfair, like everyone has a go, right?

54:58.380 --> 55:00.000
And you can miss it sometimes.

55:00.000 --> 55:03.050
Give me another go. Come on, man.

55:03.050 --> 55:03.900
This is bullshit.

55:04.879 --> 55:06.316
Thanks.

55:18.550 --> 55:21.473
- Please, put the headphones in.

55:35.650 --> 55:37.870
Good afternoon, everyone.

55:37.870 --> 55:40.820
I would like to personally
congratulate you

55:40.820 --> 55:44.550
on completing the first
stage of our training

55:44.550 --> 55:47.630
and passing a very important test.

55:47.630 --> 55:51.980
It is very important for the
next steps of this program

55:51.980 --> 55:55.740
and for your survival
outside of this facility,

55:55.740 --> 55:58.850
to be able to recognize what your senses

55:58.850 --> 56:03.850
are telling you to see,
hear, feel, smell, or taste,

56:04.120 --> 56:08.390
is not compatible with
the reality around you.

56:08.390 --> 56:13.100
Every step on this journey makes it easier

56:13.100 --> 56:18.100
and safer for you to be
able to leave this facility.

56:18.120 --> 56:22.860
Please do your very best
to pass the next steps

56:22.860 --> 56:24.953
as well as you passed this one.

56:26.080 --> 56:30.110
I am aware that everyone's
abilities are on different levels

56:31.323 --> 56:36.323
and we are slowly recognizing
who is capable of what.

56:37.340 --> 56:40.490
I am very sad to inform you

56:40.490 --> 56:44.280
that Mr. Aria didn't
reach the results required

56:44.280 --> 56:45.280
on this test.

56:46.540 --> 56:48.780
Please, do not
- All right, yeah, let me

56:48.780 --> 56:50.503
- worry about him.
- listen to what he's saying.

56:50.503 --> 56:53.280
- He will be very well taken care of.

56:53.280 --> 56:54.580
- I'll do again!

56:54.580 --> 56:56.440
What's he saying?
- I will leave you now

56:56.440 --> 56:59.010
- Let me just do it again!
- in very good hands.

57:00.437 --> 57:02.360
Almost as good as mine.

57:02.360 --> 57:03.323
- What the hell?

57:07.168 --> 57:09.018
They can't expect us just to move on.

57:38.708 --> 57:40.708
- You seem disappointed.

57:45.230 --> 57:47.117
I prefer to be honest.

57:53.180 --> 57:54.580
- How do you know my mother?

57:57.170 --> 57:59.630
- Straight to the difficult questions.

57:59.630 --> 58:00.973
- I prefer to be honest.

58:06.980 --> 58:07.813
- I know her.

58:09.700 --> 58:10.850
I used to.

58:10.850 --> 58:12.606
- Is she okay?

58:12.606 --> 58:13.856
- I don't know.

58:15.028 --> 58:15.861
I hope so.

58:16.711 --> 58:18.140
But she and Dr. Marinus,

58:18.140 --> 58:19.580
they have history.

58:19.580 --> 58:21.820
- Why wouldn't she tell me?

58:21.820 --> 58:22.770
- To keep you safe.

58:24.610 --> 58:28.870
- She said, when I came
here, I called her.

58:28.870 --> 58:30.523
She told me to leave.

58:31.833 --> 58:34.317
- It's too late for that now.

58:34.317 --> 58:35.643
Marinus knows about you.

58:36.660 --> 58:38.210
- Is he the bad guy?

58:38.210 --> 58:39.810
- In your mother's story, he is.

58:40.900 --> 58:42.543
She thinks he's like his mother.

58:45.550 --> 58:47.063
- Why wouldn't she tell me?

58:48.210 --> 58:49.771
What's she afraid of?

58:53.667 --> 58:56.370
- Dr. Marinus' grandfather
started his research

58:56.370 --> 58:58.510
in concentration camps,

58:58.510 --> 59:00.700
cutting into the brains of conjoined twins

59:00.700 --> 59:03.870
until they were able to
do what he asked them to.

59:03.870 --> 59:06.070
They thought it was
because they were twins.

59:06.970 --> 59:09.200
They brought in so many more,

59:09.200 --> 59:11.450
thinking they'd be able
to do the same thing.

59:13.290 --> 59:17.023
I was the only one who survived for years.

59:18.740 --> 59:20.580
Until your father arrived.

59:31.820 --> 59:32.653
- Where is he?

59:34.280 --> 59:35.230
- I thought he died

59:36.200 --> 59:37.683
helping your mother escape.

59:38.860 --> 59:39.693
You can't leave.

59:42.820 --> 59:44.290
If you think Marinus is dangerous,

59:44.290 --> 59:46.500
you wouldn't stand a
chance against the others.

59:46.500 --> 59:47.980
- What others?

59:47.980 --> 59:50.053
Dr. Forrester and Dr. Kimura.

59:51.245 --> 59:53.595
They were the two main
scientists in the camps.

59:55.070 --> 59:56.800
When the war ended, they parted ways

59:56.800 --> 59:58.163
to remain inconspicuous.

59:59.800 --> 1:00:02.973
Dr. Kimura and his students
are much more traditional.

1:00:03.920 --> 1:00:05.740
In the concentration camp kind of sense.

1:00:05.740 --> 1:00:07.633
- Students? Are they trained.

1:00:09.426 --> 1:00:10.727
Are they as good as you?

1:00:10.727 --> 1:00:11.560
- No.

1:00:12.560 --> 1:00:13.460
Not as good as me.

1:00:14.910 --> 1:00:16.413
You don't need to worry about them.

1:00:17.539 --> 1:00:19.350
They would have to meet you,

1:00:19.350 --> 1:00:21.820
touch you to be able to do anything.

1:00:21.820 --> 1:00:22.970
- What about my mother?

1:00:24.950 --> 1:00:27.940
- Marinus knows not to get
on the wrong side of you.

1:00:27.940 --> 1:00:30.083
Would make his work much more difficult.

1:00:31.177 --> 1:00:33.770
- What about Shaan? What happens to him?

1:00:33.770 --> 1:00:35.380
- If he can't tell what's real,

1:00:35.380 --> 1:00:37.710
his gift will be a burden to him.

1:00:37.710 --> 1:00:40.260
He'll have to hide for
the rest of his life.

1:00:40.260 --> 1:00:41.560
- Why can't he stay here?

1:00:42.540 --> 1:00:44.540
- Nadia didn't it was safe for him here,

1:00:45.420 --> 1:00:49.400
which is funny because her
abilities are much more limited.

1:00:49.400 --> 1:00:50.523
She is safe here.

1:00:52.040 --> 1:00:53.567
And she's up to something.

1:00:54.530 --> 1:00:55.633
- It isn't safe.

1:00:57.120 --> 1:01:00.230
Why would I, why would anyone stay here?

1:01:02.010 --> 1:01:03.520
- Because if you stay,

1:01:03.520 --> 1:01:06.113
I will teach you the most amazing things.

1:01:09.520 --> 1:01:10.863
Let me show you something.

1:01:32.460 --> 1:01:33.901
- Oh, aw!

1:01:33.901 --> 1:01:35.800
Aw, aw! Was that-

1:01:35.800 --> 1:01:38.220
- Yes, that was your father.

1:01:38.220 --> 1:01:39.890
I know who he is and I
know how to find him,

1:01:39.890 --> 1:01:41.310
if he's still alive.
- And how do I know

1:01:41.310 --> 1:01:42.654
you aren't just making this up?

1:01:42.654 --> 1:01:43.807
- You don't.

1:01:43.807 --> 1:01:45.197
But I can teach you.

1:02:51.360 --> 1:02:52.310
- Where am I going?

1:02:53.350 --> 1:02:54.607
- You tell me.

1:02:54.607 --> 1:02:55.983
You're the one driving.

1:02:58.373 --> 1:03:00.123
- I though this was your situation.

1:03:00.960 --> 1:03:02.862
- I only created the world.

1:03:02.862 --> 1:03:04.603
You're the one moving freely

1:03:04.603 --> 1:03:06.813
because you always had a choice, Andrew.

1:03:09.640 --> 1:03:10.690
- This isn't freedom.

1:03:12.777 --> 1:03:14.370
- If you want to leave,

1:03:14.370 --> 1:03:16.180
just drop them at their destination.

1:03:16.180 --> 1:03:18.164
- What do you mean, dr...

1:03:18.164 --> 1:03:18.997
No!

1:03:24.597 --> 1:03:27.293
- I know you're exhausted
but we need to continue.

1:03:28.470 --> 1:03:30.473
Your father is waiting for you.

1:03:33.040 --> 1:03:34.090
He wants to know you.

1:03:36.520 --> 1:03:37.787
I can take you to him.

1:03:38.664 --> 1:03:40.214
But first you must do as I say.

1:03:41.966 --> 1:03:44.000
- This is unreal.

1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:46.883
You lie and you make
promises that you can't keep.

1:03:50.190 --> 1:03:51.170
This has to stop.

1:03:51.170 --> 1:03:53.170
More and more people will only get hurt.

1:03:54.660 --> 1:03:56.480
You can choose to stop this.

1:04:02.904 --> 1:04:04.254
- This is me and my sister.

1:04:05.698 --> 1:04:08.757
My parents knew not to quit like this.

1:04:08.757 --> 1:04:12.087
She didn't last long enough
for me to remember her.

1:04:15.990 --> 1:04:17.780
I never had a choice in this.

1:04:20.400 --> 1:04:21.703
- You aren't innocent.

1:04:22.747 --> 1:04:24.600
You hurt others.

1:04:24.600 --> 1:04:26.163
- Not if I could help it.

1:05:22.000 --> 1:05:23.373
How's everyone doing today?

1:05:24.250 --> 1:05:26.050
- I think I'll be able to swap soon.

1:05:27.050 --> 1:05:30.360
- Sending information is three
times as hard as we imagined.

1:05:30.360 --> 1:05:32.570
There's no point in rushing it.

1:05:32.570 --> 1:05:34.963
- Oh, I though you were
here to teach them.

1:05:36.330 --> 1:05:39.130
- Darling, would you please
stop with all the antagonizing.

1:05:39.130 --> 1:05:40.690
It's not helping morale.

1:05:40.690 --> 1:05:42.310
- But Dr. Mar-
- Dr. Marinus wouldn't be

1:05:42.310 --> 1:05:45.080
happy to know you're trying to
do things I strictly forbid.

1:05:56.943 --> 1:05:58.363
- Are you...

1:05:58.363 --> 1:05:59.933
Is everything okay?

1:06:02.750 --> 1:06:03.583
- Watch out.

1:06:05.350 --> 1:06:07.740
- Andrew? I need your help.

1:06:07.740 --> 1:06:09.749
Yuri's not in his room.

1:06:09.749 --> 1:06:10.582
- He...

1:06:14.657 --> 1:06:15.490
Yuri?

1:06:21.571 --> 1:06:22.404
Yuri?

1:06:29.809 --> 1:06:30.642
Yuri?

1:06:39.100 --> 1:06:39.933
Yuri?

1:06:44.116 --> 1:06:44.949
- Andrew.

1:06:47.104 --> 1:06:48.472
Put this in your mouth.

1:06:51.779 --> 1:06:52.612
Please.

1:07:07.316 --> 1:07:09.400
- What happened?
- Shh.

1:07:09.400 --> 1:07:10.477
She'll hear you.

1:07:11.803 --> 1:07:16.803
- Oh, oh, shit.

1:07:19.210 --> 1:07:21.943
Hey, I saw you in my room.

1:07:25.010 --> 1:07:26.110
Can you do that again?

1:07:27.960 --> 1:07:29.363
- Nadia's not gonna hurt us.

1:07:31.713 --> 1:07:33.630
- No she didn't, she...

1:07:35.972 --> 1:07:37.605
- She heard us.

1:07:38.723 --> 1:07:42.042
- Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

1:07:46.960 --> 1:07:49.400
- No time for explanations.
Get out of the van.

1:07:49.400 --> 1:07:50.643
This is the end of your training.

1:07:50.643 --> 1:07:51.726
May's coming.

1:08:03.227 --> 1:08:04.899
- Are you okay?

1:08:08.184 --> 1:08:10.943
I asked if you were okay.

1:08:13.085 --> 1:08:13.935
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1:08:14.980 --> 1:08:17.420
- Please, I, I wanted to speak to you

1:08:17.420 --> 1:08:19.853
about your DNA test results.

1:08:21.400 --> 1:08:23.030
There've been a number of issues.

1:08:23.030 --> 1:08:25.430
Unfortunately, we couldn't
find a match for you.

1:08:28.180 --> 1:08:29.520
- That sounds unlikely.

1:08:29.520 --> 1:08:32.200
- Oh, actually, it's more
common than you might think.

1:08:32.200 --> 1:08:35.440
Although our database is large,

1:08:35.440 --> 1:08:37.033
sometimes we do strike out.

1:08:38.174 --> 1:08:39.690
- What are you saying?

1:08:39.690 --> 1:08:41.370
- What we suggest in these cases

1:08:41.370 --> 1:08:42.930
is that we share your information

1:08:42.930 --> 1:08:45.100
with some other agencies.

1:08:45.100 --> 1:08:47.143
A waiver will be required.

1:08:57.820 --> 1:08:58.653
Perfect.

1:08:59.920 --> 1:09:01.407
We'll be in touch.

1:09:01.407 --> 1:09:02.240
Yeah.

1:10:13.330 --> 1:10:14.330
- May I come inside?

1:10:17.800 --> 1:10:19.970
I have a couple of questions.

1:10:19.970 --> 1:10:21.320
- What can I help you with?

1:10:27.510 --> 1:10:29.060
- Three bodies have been found shot dead

1:10:29.060 --> 1:10:30.763
on the side of the road.

1:10:33.557 --> 1:10:36.127
- What the hell do I have to do with that?

1:10:39.737 --> 1:10:42.193
- Can I show you some photographs?

1:10:53.380 --> 1:10:54.980
Why don't you get us some water?

1:11:26.140 --> 1:11:28.073
Do you recognize any of these people?

1:12:08.081 --> 1:12:12.067
- I've never seen any of them in my life.

1:12:12.067 --> 1:12:13.726
- Are you sure?

1:12:13.726 --> 1:12:15.240
Do you want me to show them again?

1:12:15.240 --> 1:12:17.260
- I'm sure I've never seen any of them.

1:12:19.570 --> 1:12:21.640
- That's very strange, Mr. Cooper,

1:12:21.640 --> 1:12:24.233
because your DNA's been
found all over that scene.

1:12:25.320 --> 1:12:27.369
- That's not possible. I have never...

1:12:29.750 --> 1:12:31.060
I should not be speaking to you.

1:12:31.060 --> 1:12:31.910
I need a lawyer

1:12:33.940 --> 1:12:34.773
- Mr. Cooper,

1:12:35.630 --> 1:12:37.970
you don't need a lawyer if you
haven't done anything wrong.

1:12:37.970 --> 1:12:39.990
- Something's not right.
Someone is trying to fr-

1:12:39.990 --> 1:12:42.140
- Frame you for a murder
you didn't commit?

1:12:44.430 --> 1:12:46.240
- I couldn't have done this!

1:12:49.852 --> 1:12:51.240
- This isn't the first
case I've seen like this

1:12:51.240 --> 1:12:53.190
in the last couple of months.

1:12:53.190 --> 1:12:55.170
People claiming they have no memory

1:12:55.170 --> 1:12:56.610
of what they did while they supposedly

1:12:56.610 --> 1:12:57.710
committed the murders.

1:12:59.950 --> 1:13:03.000
- Where have you been
for the last five hours?

1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:04.290
- Working. I was working.

1:13:04.290 --> 1:13:06.160
I went to a meeting in the afternoon

1:13:06.160 --> 1:13:07.763
for my DNA test results.

1:13:10.250 --> 1:13:11.829
- With this man?

1:13:17.597 --> 1:13:18.430
- Doctor!

1:13:21.058 --> 1:13:22.391
- What the fuck?

1:13:24.877 --> 1:13:27.443
- And what happened in that meeting?

1:13:29.910 --> 1:13:31.510
- He asked me to sign a release.

1:13:33.147 --> 1:13:35.537
- And that took five hours?

1:13:40.540 --> 1:13:42.580
We've been watching Dr. Marinus.

1:13:42.580 --> 1:13:43.760
His family have been involved

1:13:43.760 --> 1:13:45.510
in government research for decades.

1:13:47.652 --> 1:13:50.863
This is you arriving.

1:13:52.959 --> 1:13:55.940
And this is you leaving

1:13:55.940 --> 1:13:57.983
five hours later.

1:14:00.340 --> 1:14:02.480
- I don't know. What am I
supposed to have been invo...

1:14:02.480 --> 1:14:04.320
- Mr. Cooper, do you have any idea

1:14:04.320 --> 1:14:06.810
how they could have administered a drug?

1:14:06.810 --> 1:14:07.840
- No.

1:14:07.840 --> 1:14:09.080
- We have a couple of ideas

1:14:09.080 --> 1:14:10.980
when the former might have been taken.

1:14:15.550 --> 1:14:16.720
- Maybe, I...

1:14:18.120 --> 1:14:20.640
Wait, why, why are they doing this to me?

1:14:20.640 --> 1:14:21.473
Why me?

1:14:22.310 --> 1:14:23.143
- Random pick?

1:14:25.110 --> 1:14:26.460
Or they could be looking for people

1:14:26.460 --> 1:14:28.970
with some kind of predisposition.

1:14:28.970 --> 1:14:30.470
- What kind of predisposition?

1:14:32.530 --> 1:14:34.780
- Your father's.
- My father?

1:14:34.780 --> 1:14:36.363
I don't even know my father.

1:14:39.100 --> 1:14:41.530
- I imagine your mother
doesn't speak about him much.

1:14:41.530 --> 1:14:43.360
- I don't know anything about him.

1:14:43.360 --> 1:14:44.660
How could he be important?

1:14:45.780 --> 1:14:47.410
- Family history of mental illness

1:14:47.410 --> 1:14:48.913
has been a common denominator.

1:14:51.202 --> 1:14:54.900
I'm not like him.

1:14:54.900 --> 1:14:56.200
- That's not what I meant.

1:14:57.380 --> 1:15:00.610
We assume they're looking
for a genetic predisposition

1:15:00.610 --> 1:15:03.360
to react desirably with the
drug they're administering.

1:15:04.380 --> 1:15:07.090
Different brains react
differently to different drugs.

1:15:07.090 --> 1:15:09.567
They're looking for
very specific reaction.

1:15:09.567 --> 1:15:10.767
- What kind of reaction?

1:15:12.370 --> 1:15:15.120
- A distortion in sensory processing

1:15:15.120 --> 1:15:18.020
based on what the other
suspects have described.

1:15:18.020 --> 1:15:19.720
The drug allows the sensory receptors

1:15:19.720 --> 1:15:21.420
to completely overwhelm the brain.

1:15:23.360 --> 1:15:26.660
The hallucinations are
just an exaggerated version

1:15:26.660 --> 1:15:27.963
of what actually happened.

1:15:31.737 --> 1:15:34.063
- What do you want me to do?

1:15:35.532 --> 1:15:38.115
- I want you to think very hard

1:15:39.688 --> 1:15:41.755
about what you what you remember.

1:15:53.449 --> 1:15:55.032
- I fought someone.

1:15:58.235 --> 1:15:59.746
Let's go.

1:16:10.047 --> 1:16:10.880
Get in.

1:16:12.910 --> 1:16:14.046
- No.

1:16:14.046 --> 1:16:14.879
- Him?

1:16:19.440 --> 1:16:20.840
Based on his reputation,
I don't think the fight

1:16:20.840 --> 1:16:22.958
would have lasted too long.

1:16:24.224 --> 1:16:25.666
- I don't know, I mean,

1:16:25.666 --> 1:16:27.810
it all just seems a bit too much.

1:16:27.810 --> 1:16:30.593
- Please try to focus.

1:16:31.720 --> 1:16:34.750
The drug needs to be
re-administered regularly.

1:16:34.750 --> 1:16:37.700
They would have had to give
it to you multiple times.

1:16:37.700 --> 1:16:38.540
- What does this mean for me?

1:16:38.540 --> 1:16:41.500
I mean, I can't be held
responsible for this.

1:16:41.500 --> 1:16:42.880
Can I?
- Mr. Cooper,

1:16:42.880 --> 1:16:44.790
everything will be okay
as long as you cooperate

1:16:44.790 --> 1:16:48.610
- No, they, they've planted
all of this on me, I...

1:16:48.610 --> 1:16:49.903
I can't...

1:16:50.900 --> 1:16:53.100
I had nothing to do with this.

1:16:53.100 --> 1:16:53.933
- Mr. Cooper,

1:16:55.080 --> 1:16:57.390
I promise you, I'm on your side.

1:16:57.390 --> 1:17:00.519
You just have to tell me the
truth about what's happened.

1:17:00.519 --> 1:17:02.893
And then I can catch the
people that did this.

1:17:08.220 --> 1:17:09.580
Would you like some water?

1:17:09.580 --> 1:17:10.413
- No.

1:17:15.533 --> 1:17:17.494
- So what happened next?

1:17:24.986 --> 1:17:26.220
- Rebecca?

1:17:26.220 --> 1:17:27.053
I was on a bus.

1:17:28.570 --> 1:17:30.120
They were driving me somewhere.

1:17:38.040 --> 1:17:40.804
- Any idea how long you were driving for?

1:17:40.804 --> 1:17:42.221
- It felt like...

1:17:43.928 --> 1:17:45.095
I don't know.

1:17:46.352 --> 1:17:47.509
- Anything else?

1:17:56.359 --> 1:17:59.359
- There was some other people there.

1:18:11.511 --> 1:18:12.878
There was a woman.

1:18:18.469 --> 1:18:22.146
I think, I think she'd
been following me before.

1:18:22.146 --> 1:18:23.313
- Is this her?

1:18:27.621 --> 1:18:32.427
- Darling, you know I hate
it when you call me a thing.

1:18:32.427 --> 1:18:35.020
- Was she part of the experiment?

1:18:35.020 --> 1:18:36.503
- We don't know who she is.

1:18:38.310 --> 1:18:39.878
She works for Dr. Marinus.

1:18:44.284 --> 1:18:45.117
- Rebecca!

1:18:50.546 --> 1:18:52.379
Rebecca.
- No, help me!

1:18:55.301 --> 1:18:57.301
Help me, Andrew! Please!

1:19:01.927 --> 1:19:03.583
- I want this to be over.

1:19:07.970 --> 1:19:08.803
It's night.

1:19:09.954 --> 1:19:11.654
But why is it night?

1:19:11.654 --> 1:19:12.821
- No it's not.

1:19:14.320 --> 1:19:15.153
It's light.

1:19:18.290 --> 1:19:20.600
- Think about what brought you here.

1:19:20.600 --> 1:19:22.403
You have a job to do. Focus.

1:19:24.283 --> 1:19:26.533
- I think she was telling
me to do something.

1:19:29.890 --> 1:19:31.440
- Can you remember what it was?

1:19:32.373 --> 1:19:35.080
- I don't know. I haven't done anything.

1:19:35.080 --> 1:19:36.720
I haven't done anything.

1:19:38.880 --> 1:19:40.112
- You can trust me.

1:19:46.064 --> 1:19:49.087
- There was this orange room with a safe.

1:19:49.087 --> 1:19:54.087
The code was 5, uh, 7-5-1-0.

1:19:56.520 --> 1:19:57.353
There was a gun.

1:20:01.796 --> 1:20:04.213
- Did the gun look like this?

1:20:05.057 --> 1:20:06.553
Are you sure?

1:20:06.553 --> 1:20:07.386
- Mm-hmm.

1:20:08.607 --> 1:20:09.613
- Did you touch it?

1:20:12.000 --> 1:20:13.470
- I held it, yeah.

1:20:13.470 --> 1:20:15.233
But I haven't killed anyone.

1:20:17.340 --> 1:20:19.960
- Well that's what we're trying
to figure out, aren't we?

1:20:19.960 --> 1:20:22.630
- What do you mean? I
thought you were on my side?

1:20:22.630 --> 1:20:25.215
- Of course I am, Mr. Cooper.

1:20:25.215 --> 1:20:26.410
We can't just let you go.

1:20:26.410 --> 1:20:28.050
Can we?

1:20:28.050 --> 1:20:29.350
What if it repeats itself?

1:20:33.590 --> 1:20:34.423
Anything else?

1:20:39.040 --> 1:20:40.890
I promise you, Mr. Cooper,

1:20:40.890 --> 1:20:43.380
your life will be much, much easier

1:20:43.380 --> 1:20:44.830
if you decide to tell us the truth

1:20:44.830 --> 1:20:46.640
about what you remember.

1:20:46.640 --> 1:20:49.513
- I'm not saying anything
more unless I have a lawyer.

1:20:52.074 --> 1:20:53.483
- That won't be necessary.

1:21:11.743 --> 1:21:13.160
It's your mother.

1:21:14.950 --> 1:21:16.852
It's your mother.

1:21:20.517 --> 1:21:22.017
I need your phone.

1:21:24.250 --> 1:21:25.193
Andrew Cooper.

1:21:26.870 --> 1:21:28.070
Please call your mother.

1:21:30.042 --> 1:21:30.875
Mom.

1:21:31.980 --> 1:21:32.893
Yeah, I'm fine.

1:21:35.700 --> 1:21:37.830
Sorry I didn't respond.

1:21:41.700 --> 1:21:46.676
Mom, they didn't find anybody
even remotely related to me.

1:21:48.550 --> 1:21:49.800
- Put this in your mouth.

1:21:53.070 --> 1:21:54.270
Please.

1:21:54.270 --> 1:21:57.425
Different brains react
differently to different drugs.

1:21:58.800 --> 1:22:00.461
The drug allows the sensory receptors

1:22:00.461 --> 1:22:02.190
to completely overwhelm the brain.

1:22:02.190 --> 1:22:05.472
The hallucinations are
just an exaggerated version

1:22:05.472 --> 1:22:08.162
of what actually happened.

1:22:17.808 --> 1:22:18.641
- Ah!

1:22:21.675 --> 1:22:24.692
Jesus! Open up, May, open the window!

1:22:30.034 --> 1:22:33.046
I think we need to touch you
up a little bit more, don't we?

1:22:41.260 --> 1:22:43.930
Yes, Dr. Marinus, I
have decided to continue

1:22:43.930 --> 1:22:44.830
with the training.

1:22:49.110 --> 1:22:50.060
They're struggling.

1:22:51.000 --> 1:22:53.250
- You don't know what
struggling looks like.

1:22:53.250 --> 1:22:55.020
I've personally seen
the classified footage

1:22:55.020 --> 1:22:56.940
from the first experiments.

1:22:56.940 --> 1:22:58.540
- Back when the organization was overrun

1:22:58.540 --> 1:23:00.780
by defective Nazis, huh?

1:23:00.780 --> 1:23:03.047
I think we can do better, don't you?

1:23:03.047 --> 1:23:04.982
- Now then, get rid of Shaan.

1:23:08.730 --> 1:23:09.574
- Ernesto.

1:23:19.857 --> 1:23:22.127
- What's he saying?

1:23:22.127 --> 1:23:23.187
I'll go again!

1:23:23.187 --> 1:23:24.393
What's he saying?

1:23:25.550 --> 1:23:26.383
Let me just do it again!

1:23:26.383 --> 1:23:27.711
This is bullshit, man!

1:23:36.995 --> 1:23:39.620
- My brother and I got
here the same way you did.

1:23:39.620 --> 1:23:41.317
Dr. Marinus brought us here.

1:23:41.317 --> 1:23:42.150
- Brother?

1:23:43.422 --> 1:23:45.339
- You're so nice to me.

1:23:50.000 --> 1:23:51.263
Our parents adopted us.

1:23:52.421 --> 1:23:53.621
It's Stockholm syndrome.

1:23:58.540 --> 1:24:00.190
- Our client's targets are Quinn,

1:24:03.485 --> 1:24:04.318
Rebecca,

1:24:06.880 --> 1:24:07.713
and Yuri.

1:24:23.810 --> 1:24:25.489
- What are you doing?

1:24:25.489 --> 1:24:26.539
- Mr. Cooper, please.

1:24:29.040 --> 1:24:30.683
Investigation terminated.

1:24:32.040 --> 1:24:32.990
Ready when you are.

1:24:41.810 --> 1:24:42.960
- Good evening, Andrew.

1:24:44.490 --> 1:24:45.323
Nadia.

1:24:47.539 --> 1:24:49.220
How much does he know?

1:24:49.220 --> 1:24:51.050
He remembers everything.

1:24:51.050 --> 1:24:52.383
Recognizes everyone.

1:24:53.290 --> 1:24:54.123
Even me.

1:24:56.385 --> 1:24:59.233
- I'm afraid I have some
bad news, Mr. Cooper.

1:24:59.233 --> 1:25:01.278
Earlier today, you
committed three murders.

1:25:01.278 --> 1:25:02.628
- No, it's not possible.

1:25:14.457 --> 1:25:16.434
That's not possible.

1:25:16.434 --> 1:25:17.989
- Believe me, I was there.

1:25:21.606 --> 1:25:22.439
- No, I...

1:25:25.450 --> 1:25:26.950
- Would you like to hear more?

1:25:26.950 --> 1:25:28.450
No, no!

1:25:33.514 --> 1:25:36.850
- This drug, if administered correctly,

1:25:36.850 --> 1:25:39.600
allows us to take control
of your actions with ease.

1:25:39.600 --> 1:25:42.297
Maybe even make you feel like
a hero in your own story.

1:25:47.660 --> 1:25:49.730
You'll obey almost every command

1:25:49.730 --> 1:25:52.330
if introduced by an appropriate stimuli.

1:25:52.330 --> 1:25:56.250
I didn't,
I didn't do anything.

1:25:56.250 --> 1:25:58.647
- Forensic evidence
would suggest otherwise.

1:26:07.720 --> 1:26:09.020
- You can't do this to me.

1:26:10.090 --> 1:26:12.540
- Unfortunately, that's
exactly what we did.

1:26:12.540 --> 1:26:13.560
- But you just have to know the truth

1:26:13.560 --> 1:26:15.558
about what's happening to you.

1:26:15.558 --> 1:26:19.110
- I, I just, let me go, okay?

1:26:19.110 --> 1:26:21.173
I won't tell anyone.

1:26:21.173 --> 1:26:22.850
- I'm afraid that's not possible

1:26:22.850 --> 1:26:25.050
at this stage of your training.

1:26:27.824 --> 1:26:29.743
- I just wanna tell you.

1:26:29.743 --> 1:26:32.164
I don't want to work for you anymore.

1:26:47.560 --> 1:26:51.803
- Maybe you'd like a glass of water?

1:27:01.404 --> 1:27:04.154
- What about the facil, facility?

1:27:09.480 --> 1:27:10.780
- Take a seat, Mr. Cooper.

1:27:21.730 --> 1:27:22.823
- Why am I here then?

1:27:24.170 --> 1:27:26.420
We had to test if
your memories and recollections

1:27:26.420 --> 1:27:28.320
would lead anyone back to our program.

1:27:31.225 --> 1:27:34.480
- I, I didn't do anything though.

1:27:34.480 --> 1:27:36.730
- That doesn't mean you
won't speak about it.

1:27:46.223 --> 1:27:47.556
- It's working.

1:27:50.558 --> 1:27:53.280
- This will help you see
the world in a new light.

1:27:53.280 --> 1:27:56.033
After all, it did come from
LSD all those years ago.

1:28:29.115 --> 1:28:30.282
- Hey, Andrew!

1:28:32.040 --> 1:28:33.540
We did it.

1:28:33.540 --> 1:28:35.413
We've completed the training.

1:28:41.858 --> 1:28:43.570
We've come to the end.

1:28:43.570 --> 1:28:44.503
It was all a test.

1:28:49.570 --> 1:28:50.403
Look.

1:28:55.300 --> 1:28:57.010
They gave me this.

1:28:57.010 --> 1:28:59.329
This will unlock all of our abilities.

1:29:04.240 --> 1:29:06.823
We'll be like superheroes. You and me.

1:29:15.520 --> 1:29:17.163
We'll be like gods.

1:29:19.090 --> 1:29:20.113
All of this,

1:29:22.070 --> 1:29:23.340
all of this will be ours.

1:29:30.626 --> 1:29:31.543
You and me.

1:29:33.734 --> 1:29:36.567
If I can save them all,

1:29:37.861 --> 1:29:39.443
I'm the hero.
