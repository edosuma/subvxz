It just tells them
they're winning.

08:48.565 --> 08:50.298
Two -- never
turn your back on them.

That's when
they take advantage.

08:51.768 --> 08:53.701
And three -- always carry
a little black plastic bag.

08:53.770 --> 08:57.438
Uh, where did you
get all this from?

Blue, blue,
what did I just say?

09:08.851 --> 09:10.785
That's it, Gumball,
you're grounded.

09:10.853 --> 09:13.387
No, no, no! Do that, and they'll
never trust me again.

But...

09:55.898 --> 09:57.699
I am gonna let
one of you do it.

10:14.450 --> 10:16.850
You see, the best way
to deal with kids

10:16.920 --> 10:18.052
is to turn them against
each other

10:18.121 --> 10:19.921
until they've
worn themselves out.

10:19.989 --> 10:22.790
Richard, you --

10:22.858 --> 10:24.058
You did it.
