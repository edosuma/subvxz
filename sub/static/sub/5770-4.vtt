WHY WOULDN'T HE TELL YOU?

07:27.011 --> 07:28.360
'CAUSE I WAS SCARED,
SHAUNA.

07:28.404 --> 07:30.450
HE DIDN'T TELL ME
BECAUSE HE FEELS SORRY FOR ME

07:30.493 --> 07:32.713
BECAUSE I AM A PATHETIC SPINSTER
WITH NO PROSPECTS.

07:32.756 --> 07:35.367
THAT'S NOT TRUE!

07:37.326 --> 07:39.328
I THINK
SOMEONE NEEDS A HUG.

07:39.371 --> 07:40.503
SHE WAS IN A REALLY GOOD PLACE,
LIKE, TWO MINUTES AGO.

07:40.547 --> 07:42.287
I MEAN ME.

MISS I'LL-GET-BACK-TO-YOU

07:50.034 --> 07:51.296
GOT BACK TO ME.

07:51.340 --> 07:52.472
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

07:52.515 --> 07:53.951
PUFFING ON
MY ELECTRONIC QUITTER CIG,

07:53.995 --> 07:55.692
DRINKING AN ENERGY DRINK.

07:55.736 --> 07:57.172
THAT'S WEIRD. HEY, TELL ME
WHY I SHOULDN'T HANG UP

07:57.215 --> 07:59.000
ON YOU RIGHT NOW AND TALK

07:59.043 --> 08:02.307
BECAUSE YOU CAN TALK TO HIM
TONIGHT AT THE PARTY WITH ME?

08:02.351 --> 08:05.180
OH. YEAH.

08:05.223 --> 08:06.486
YOU GONNA BRING IT?

08:06.529 --> 08:09.271
YEAH, MY COSTUME IS GOING
TO BLOW YOUR MIND.

08:09.314 --> 08:11.578
OHH. OKAY. SEE YOU THERE.

08:14.232 --> 08:18.280

THAT BLOWS PEOPLE'S MINDS.

08:20.325 --> 08:21.762
DANNY.
DANNY, LOOK.

08:21.805 --> 08:22.806
THAT DMV CLERK
IS DRESSED UP

08:22.850 --> 08:24.329
AS A VAMPIRE
FOR HALLOWEEN.

08:24.373 --> 08:26.767
YEAH, I BET ON HALLOWEEN,
ACTUAL MONSTERS

08:26.810 --> 08:29.073
DRESS UP

08:29.117 --> 08:30.640
EH, DANNY?
MY JOKE, DANNY.

08:30.684 --> 08:31.815
WOULD YOU SHUT UP?
I'M TRYING TO STUDY.

08:31.859 --> 08:33.338
I THOUGHT THE WHOLE POINT
OF COMING

08:33.382 --> 08:35.036
TO LONG ISLAND WAS THE TEST
WAS MEANT TO BE EASY.

08:35.079 --> 08:37.038
IT'S STILL A TEST.
YOU CAN'T FLIRT

08:37.081 --> 08:38.343
AND SPRAY-TAN
YOUR WAY THROUGH IT.

08:38.387 --> 08:39.867
WHY ARE YOU SO MUCH ANGRIER
THAN USUAL?

08:39.910 --> 08:41.521
IT'S JUST A DRIVER'S LICENSE.

08:41.564 --> 08:43.261
YEAH, NO, IT'S NOT
A LICENSE TO DRIVE.

08:43.305 --> 08:44.436
IT'S A LICENSE
TO BE A MAN.

08:44.480 --> 08:46.787
A MAN GOES WHERE HE WANTS
WHEN HE WANTS.

08:46.830 --> 08:49.920
I HAVE A PICTURE IN MY HEAD
OF ME DRIVING THROUGH THE NIGHT,

08:49.964 --> 08:52.923
NOTHING BUT 1,000 MILES
OF DARK EMPTY AHEAD,

08:52.967 --> 08:55.578
AND, FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN MY LIFE, I'M FREE.

08:55.622 --> 08:57.449
WOW.

08:57.493 --> 08:59.843
SO WHY DO YOU WANT
TO GET YOUR LICENSE?

08:59.887 --> 09:03.325
TIRED OF CARRYING
MY PASSPORT AROUND TO BARS.

09:03.368 --> 09:06.284
IT'S SO BULKY.

09:06.328 --> 09:07.547
[Shauna]
HEY, BAD NEWS.

09:07.590 --> 09:09.200
THEY WERE OUT
OF ALL THE SEXY COSTUMES.

09:09.244 --> 09:10.419
THEY'RE THE FIRST TO GO.

09:10.462 --> 09:12.116
GOOD NEWS,
THEY STILL HAD

09:12.160 --> 09:13.335
A TON OF KIDS' COSTUMES.

09:13.378 --> 09:14.641
HOW IS THAT GOOD NEWS?

09:14.684 --> 09:17.295
ARE YOU KIDDING?
IT'LL BARELY COVER YOUR TORSO.

09:17.339 --> 09:18.775
WHICH IS HOT.

09:18.819 --> 09:21.169
OKAY, AS A NURSE,
THIS COSTUME OFFENDS ME.

09:21.212 --> 09:23.737
IT'S NOT SKIMPY OUTFITS
THAT MAKE NURSES SEXY.

09:23.780 --> 09:25.826
IT'S THE HELPING PEOPLE
THAT MAKE US SEXY.

09:25.869 --> 09:28.916
DR. LAHIRI, I BOUGHT
THE PERFECT COSTUME FOR YOU.

09:28.959 --> 09:31.179
MM-HMM.

09:31.222 --> 09:32.397
IS THAT
A FAT ALBERT COSTUME?

09:32.441 --> 09:34.225
LINUS.

09:34.269 --> 09:35.836
YOU KNOW, FROM IT'S THE GREAT
PUMPKIN, CHARLIE BROWN.

09:35.879 --> 09:37.620
SO HE'S NOT EVEN THE STAR
OF THE THING

09:37.664 --> 09:38.621
THAT YOU KNOW HIM FROM?

09:38.665 --> 09:40.057
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN IT?

09:40.101 --> 09:42.277
IT'S THE BEST.
IT'S HALLOWEEN,

09:42.320 --> 09:43.408
AND LINUS IS EXCITED
FOR THE GREAT PUMPKIN,

09:43.452 --> 09:44.888
WHO COMES EVERY YEAR
TO BRING TOYS

09:44.932 --> 09:46.063
TO ALL THE GOOD BOYS
AND GIRLS.

09:46.107 --> 09:48.283
WHY ARE YOU DESCRIBING
THIS CARTOON TO ME?

09:48.326 --> 09:49.458
I'M SORRY.
I'M JUST IN CRISIS RIGHT NOW.

09:49.501 --> 09:51.155
ALL RIGHT?
WHAT I REALLY NEED YOU TO DO

09:51.199 --> 09:52.722
IS TO TAKE THESE SCISSORS
AND CUT A CLEAVAGE HOLE

09:52.766 --> 09:54.594
IN MY CRAYON COSTUME.

09:54.637 --> 09:57.074
26 OUT OF 36.

09:57.118 --> 09:58.510

10:02.950 --> 10:04.038
LOOK, DANNY.

10:04.081 --> 10:05.256
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

10:05.300 --> 10:06.693
DID YOU EVEN READ THE BOOK?

10:06.736 --> 10:09.609
THOSE PRACTICE QUESTIONS
ARE TAKEN FROM REAL PAST EXAMS.

10:09.652 --> 10:12.133
LOGIC, A DASH OF LUCK,
AND, AS ALWAYS,

10:12.176 --> 10:13.395
A LITTLE BIT OF CHARM.

10:13.438 --> 10:15.266
YOU CHARMED
A SCANTRON SHEET?

10:15.310 --> 10:17.965
OH, DANNY, SHOULD WE

10:24.493 --> 10:25.450
WAIT, HOW MANY TIMES
HAVE YOU TAKEN THAT TEST?

10:25.494 --> 10:26.538
A FEW TIMES.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

10:26.582 --> 10:27.539
WE'RE ALL PULLING
