WEBVTT

00:01.160 --> 00:01.956
PREVIOUSLY ON
PRETI'Y LI'ITLE LIARS...

00:04.400 --> 00:07.267
THE MRI CONFIRMED
A PARTIAL TEAR OF
THE ROTATOR CUFF.

00:07.300 --> 00:09.439
WHAT ABOUT SWIMMING?
THERE'S A POSSIBILITY
OF SURGERY.

00:09.470 --> 00:12.439
THE OUTCOME IS UNPREDICT ABLE.
SO? UNPREDICT ABLE
CAN BE GOOD.

00:12.480 --> 00:14.368
Hanna: IT'S THE GUN--
AT LEAST I THINK IT IS.

00:14.410 --> 00:16.298
THAT GUN WAS USED
TO KILL DETECTIVE WILDEN,

00:16.350 --> 00:18.500
AND YOUR MOTHER'S FINGERPRINTS
ARE ON THE BULLETS.

00:18.550 --> 00:19.778
WE ENTERED A PLEA
OF NOT GUILTY,

00:19.820 --> 00:21.549
BUT THE JUDGE REFUSED
TO GRANT BAIL.

00:21.580 --> 00:23.582
I'M GONNA CONFESS TO
KILLING DETECTIVE WILDEN.

00:23.620 --> 00:26.180
YOU'RE GONNA HELP ME.
SUPPOSE I'M THE ONE WHO
ACTUALLY SET UP YOUR MOTHER.

00:26.220 --> 00:29.656
WHO ARE YOU? WHY ARE YOU HERE?
BECKE'I'I' FRYE. DISCOVERY
IN THE MARIN CASE.

00:29.690 --> 00:33.148
DO YOU KNOW WHAT'S IN THERE?
THAT IS ABOUT WILDEN
AND RADLEY AND TOBY'S MOM.

00:33.200 --> 00:35.054
WHAT DID THE DOCTOR SAY
ABOUT YOUR EYES?

00:35.100 --> 00:36.829
I'LL HAVE GOOD DAYS
AND BAD DAYS.

00:36.870 --> 00:39.589
ON YOUR DARKEST DAYS YOU KNOW
I'LL BE HERE FOR YOU.

00:39.640 --> 00:42.564
I'M NOT A SAINT.
JUST BECAUSE A MAN
HAS BEEN ORDAINED...

00:44.610 --> 00:46.134
IF YOU'RE SCARED
AND YOU NEED HELP,

00:46.180 --> 00:49.172
I'M HERE FOR YOU, WITHOUT
ANY COMPLICATIONS, OKAY?

00:49.210 --> 00:51.075
I'D LIKE TO SPEAK
TO A DETECTIVE.

00:51.110 --> 00:52.816
MONA VANDERWAAL IS AT
THE POLICE STATION.

00:52.850 --> 00:55.171
SHE JUST WALKED IN
AND CONFESSED TO KILLING WILDEN.

01:03.860 --> 01:05.828
WHY DID YOU KILL
DETECTIVE WILDEN?

01:05.860 --> 01:09.159
I ALREADY TOLD YOU.
IT WAS SELF-DEFENSE.

01:09.200 --> 01:11.464
THEN TELL ME ABOUT IT AGAIN.

01:13.340 --> 01:14.398
HE GRABBED ME.

01:15.740 --> 01:18.607
HE WAS GONNA KILL ME.
I FOUGHT BACK.

01:20.610 --> 01:23.170
AND YOU PULLED OUT A GUN
AND SHOT HIM THREE TIMES.

01:23.210 --> 01:27.146
NO. FOR THE FIFTH TIME,
I SHOT HIM TWICE.

01:30.350 --> 01:34.184
WHAT DID YOU HEAR WILDEN SAY
AT THE HALLOWEEN PARTY?

01:34.220 --> 01:36.723
HE WAS WORRIED
THAT GARRETT WAS GONNA
TELL THE TRUTH

01:36.760 --> 01:38.853
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
THE NIGHT ALISON DIED.

01:38.890 --> 01:40.448
GARRETT WAS KILLED
ON THE TRAIN,

01:40.500 --> 01:41.626
SO WHY DIDN'T YOU
GO TO THE POLICE?

01:41.660 --> 01:43.366
I WAS AFRAID I WAS
GONNA GET INTO TROUBLE.

01:43.400 --> 01:45.197
I HAD SNUCK OUT OF RADLEY
THAT NIGHT.

01:45.230 --> 01:48.233
YOU SNUCK OUT OF
A MENTAL INSTITUTION.

01:48.270 --> 01:50.135
MANY TIMES.

01:53.780 --> 01:55.634
LOOK...

01:55.680 --> 01:59.241
WILDEN WAS OBSESSED WITH
TRYING TO PIN ALISON'S MURDER
ON MY FRIENDS.

01:59.280 --> 02:00.918
SO YOU TRIED
TO BLACKMAIL HIM.

02:00.950 --> 02:04.386
YES.
BUT IT DIDN'T WORK.

02:07.260 --> 02:10.286
ONCE HE REALIZED
I KNEW HE KILLED GARRETT,

02:10.330 --> 02:12.548
HE BECAME ENRAGED.

02:12.600 --> 02:15.922
AND HE WOULDN'T LET GO.

02:15.960 --> 02:18.827
HE LEI-T ME WITH NO CHOICE.

02:18.870 --> 02:20.292
I HAD TO KILL HIM.

02:24.210 --> 02:26.371
YOU COULD HAVE
GOTTEN AWAY WITH THIS.

02:26.410 --> 02:27.809
WHY CONFESS NOW?

02:30.550 --> 02:33.178
I CAN'T LET MY BEST FRIEND'S MOM

02:33.220 --> 02:36.417
GO DOWN FOR A MURDER
SHE DIDN'T COMMIT.

02:39.460 --> 02:41.087
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

02:44.960 --> 02:47.690
( door opens, closes )

02:55.240 --> 02:57.401
HEY.
WHERE WERE YOU?

02:57.440 --> 03:01.399
I WENT BACK TO THE STATION
TO SEE WHAT ,I‘ﬁg'NLD FIND OUT.

03:01.440 --> 03:04.944
APPARENTLY Al-TER WE LEI-T
LAST NIGHT, MONA MADE
A FULL CONFESSION.

03:04.980 --> 03:07.210
DID YOU GIRLS
PUT HER UP TO THIS

03:07.250 --> 03:09.844
THINKING IT WOULD
SOMEHOW HELP ASHLEY?

03:09.890 --> 03:12.552
OF COURSE NOT. WE WOULD NEVER
DO ANYTHING THAT STUPID.

03:12.590 --> 03:14.353
I KNEW MONA WAS DEVIOUS,
BUT THIS IS BEYOND ANYTHING

03:14.390 --> 03:15.948
I EVER THOUGHT
SHE WAS CAPABLE OF.

03:15.990 --> 03:17.855
WHAT MAKES YOU SO SURE
THAT SHE DIDN'T DO IT?

03:17.890 --> 03:20.620
THINGS SHE SAID
IN HER CONFESSION CONTRADICT
SOME OF THE EVIDENCE.

03:22.330 --> 03:25.299
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHY MONA WOULD DO THIS?

03:25.330 --> 03:28.231
NO. NO, HONEST.

03:28.270 --> 03:31.831
I HOPE NOT,
BECAUSE IF YOU GIRLS
ARE INVOLVED IN ANY WAY,

03:31.870 --> 03:33.872
IT WILL REALLY HURT
YOUR MOTHER'S CASE.

03:40.880 --> 03:44.338
PLEASE TELL ME YOU HAD
NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS.

03:50.760 --> 03:53.320
* GOT A SECRET,
CAN YOU KEEP IT *

03:53.360 --> 03:55.920
* SWEAR THIS ONE
YOU'LL SAVE *

03:55.960 --> 03:58.360
* BETTER LOCK IT
IN YOUR POCKET *

03:58.400 --> 04:01.039
* TAKING THIS ONE
TO THE GRAVE *

04:01.070 --> 04:06.007
* IF I SHOW YOU THEN I'LL KNOW
YOU WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID *

04:06.040 --> 04:08.531
* 'CAUSE TWO CAN
KEEP A SECRET *

04:13.820 --> 04:14.514
HANNA WAS PLANNING
ON DOING WHAT?

04:16.050 --> 04:18.780
WHY DIDN'T SHE TELL US
ALL THIS LAST NIGHT?

04:18.820 --> 04:20.253
I DON'T--

04:21.820 --> 04:24.357
HUH? NO. NO, I'M--
I'M STILL HERE.

04:24.390 --> 04:26.620
I'M ON MY WAY, SPENCE,
I JUST--

04:26.660 --> 04:28.696
I HAD TO SAY BYE TO JAKE.

04:28.730 --> 04:31.028
WELL, AFTER EVERYTHING
THAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT,

04:31.070 --> 04:34.392
I DIDN'T WANT TO STAY ALONE.
MY DAD'S STILL IN SYRACUSE.

04:35.540 --> 04:37.405
WHAT? NO.

04:37.440 --> 04:39.032
HE SLEPT ON MY COUCH.

04:39.070 --> 04:40.833
SEE YOU SOON.

04:49.350 --> 04:51.386
HI.

04:51.420 --> 04:54.059
HEY. WAS THAT ABOUT MONA?

04:54.090 --> 04:56.957
OH. NO, THERE'S...
STILL NO UPDATE.

04:56.990 --> 04:58.924
UM, THAT WAS SPENCER.
I HAVE TO GO MEET HER.

04:58.960 --> 05:00.029
NOW?

05:00.060 --> 05:04.292
I THOUGHT WE COULD
GRAB SOME BREAKFAST
AT THE GRILLE.

05:05.100 --> 05:07.989
AHH. YOU KNOW,
I'D REALLY LOVE TO,

05:08.040 --> 05:11.669
BUT SHE'S HELPING ME CRAM
FOR THIS HISTORY TEST, SO...

05:11.710 --> 05:15.806
OKAY. WELL, CAN'T DO ANYTHING
WITHOUT A LITTLE CAFFEINE,
RIGHT?

05:15.840 --> 05:17.705
WE COULD STOP BY THE BREW
ON YOUR WAY OVER.

05:17.750 --> 05:20.548
MY TREAT.

05:20.580 --> 05:24.346
OKAY, YOU SLEPT
ON MY COUCH.
IT'S MY TREAT.

05:27.120 --> 05:29.827
Emily: I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO THINK.

05:29.860 --> 05:31.953
WELL, I TOTALLY BELIEVE
MONA COULD HAVE DONE IT.

05:31.990 --> 05:33.958
HELLO? SHE RAN HANNA OVER
WITH A CAR.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.766
I JUST CAN'T HELP BUT FEEL
THAT MONA'S GONNA SOMEHOW
DRAG US INTO THIS.

05:37.800 --> 05:39.836
CAN WE TAKE A MONA BREAK
FOR LIKE TWO SECONDS

05:39.870 --> 05:41.690
AND TALK ABOUT
YOUR BIRTHDAY?

05:41.740 --> 05:43.105
IT'S NOT UNTIL TOMORROW.

05:43.140 --> 05:45.358
WHO KNOWS, BY THEN I COULD BE
WEARING AN ORANGE JUMPSUIT.

05:45.410 --> 05:47.878
WELL, THEN WE NEED TO
MAKE TONIGHT EXT RA-SPECIAL.

05:47.910 --> 05:51.107
I GOT THE KEY TO
MY AUNT'S LAKE HOUSE.

05:51.150 --> 05:54.745
HOW ABOUT A QUITE NIGHT,
JUST THE TWO OF US?

05:57.090 --> 05:59.479
WHAT'S THIS?
AN EARLY BIRTHDAY GII-T.

06:04.690 --> 06:07.454
DOMINIC TRAINS A LOT
OF DIVISION ONE SWIMMERS.

06:07.500 --> 06:10.389
YEAH, AND A FEW
GOLD MEDALISTS, TOO.

06:10.430 --> 06:12.898
I MADE AN APPOINTMENT
FOR YOU TO MEET WITH HIM
IN PHILLY THIS AI-TERNOON.

06:12.940 --> 06:14.737
TODAY? WHY?

06:14.770 --> 06:17.159
BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO KNOW
WHAT YOUR OPTIONS ARE.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.929
PAIGE, I HAVE AN INJURY.
I CAN'T SWIM.

06:19.980 --> 06:23.871
RIGHT NOW. BUT NO ONE SAID
YOU COULD NEVER SWIM AGAIN.

06:23.910 --> 06:26.617
OR THAT YOU HAVE TO
GO TO COLLEGE NEXT YEAR.

06:26.650 --> 06:30.188
MY MOM AND I ARE LOOKING AT
THREE COLLEGES NEXT WEEKEND.

06:30.220 --> 06:33.951
STATE SCHOOLS THAT
YOU DON'T REALLY
WANT TO GO TO.

06:33.990 --> 06:36.049
OR...

06:36.090 --> 06:37.751
YOU COULD TAKE A YEAR OFF.

06:37.790 --> 06:41.499
AND TRAIN. AND SPEND
THE NEXT FOUR YEARS
DOING WHAT YOU LOVE

06:41.530 --> 06:44.169
WITH THE PERSON
THAT YOU LOVE.

06:44.200 --> 06:46.839
YOU'LL MEET WITH HIM,
RIGHT?

06:46.870 --> 06:47.962
YEAH.

06:49.740 --> 06:52.436
THANKS. SO, UH,

06:52.480 --> 06:55.529
IS YOUR DAD
COMING HOME TONIGHT?

06:55.580 --> 06:58.947
I JUST--I JUST WANT
TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE NOT
HOME ALONE AGAIN.

07:00.220 --> 07:02.643
UH, YEAH, HE GETS BACK IN
THIS AFTERNOON.

07:02.690 --> 07:05.215
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
A FAMILY MOVIE NIGHT TONIGHT.

07:05.250 --> 07:07.650
HMM.
Maggie: I WANTED YOU TO BE

07:07.690 --> 07:09.783
THE FIRST TO KNOW
I GOT INTO GRAD SCHOOL.

07:09.830 --> 07:12.185
I'M FINALLY GONNA GET
MY MASTERS IN EDUCATION.

07:12.230 --> 07:14.824
GREAT.
YEAH, IT'S NOT
COLUMBIA TEACHERS COLLEGE,

07:14.860 --> 07:16.521
BUT IT'S STILL
A REALLY GREAT PROGRAM

07:16.570 --> 07:18.868
AND THEY OFFERED ME A STIPEND
IF I TEACH ONE CLASS.

07:22.570 --> 07:24.106
THAN KS.

07:24.140 --> 07:26.529
ALL RIGHT, WELL,
I SHOULD PROBABLY GO.

07:26.580 --> 07:29.208
BUT THANK YOU MUCH AGAIN
FOR LAST NIGHT.

07:29.240 --> 07:30.605
ANYTIME.

07:32.580 --> 07:35.549
UH, BYE.

07:35.580 --> 07:39.482
Maggie: I MEAN,
UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON
IS IN THE TOP TEN.

07:39.520 --> 07:42.557
I'M--I'M SORRY,
DID YOU SAY UNIVERSITY
OF WASHINGTON?

07:42.590 --> 07:44.478
YEAH.

07:44.530 --> 07:46.157
AS IN SEATTLE,
WASHINGTON?

07:46.190 --> 07:48.499
YEAH. I KNOW IT'S NOT IDEAL.

07:48.530 --> 07:50.225
WELL, IDEAL WOULD BE
IN THIS AREA CODE.

07:50.270 --> 07:53.239
IT'S THE ONLY SCHOOL
THAT OFFERED ME MONEY.

07:53.270 --> 07:56.262
YOU'RE STILL GONNA
SEE MALCOLM, EZRA,
JUST NOT EVERY DAY.

07:56.300 --> 07:59.235
YOU MEAN NOT MOST DAYS.

07:59.270 --> 08:03.240
YOU'LL HAVE THE SUMMERS OFF,
AND HE'LL HAVE BREAKS TOO.

08:03.280 --> 08:07.239
I NEED TO DO THIS.
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR MY FUTURE.

08:07.280 --> 08:09.009
AND MALCOLM'S.

08:12.150 --> 08:16.257
NOBODY CONFESSES TO
A MURDER THEY DIDN'T COMMIT.

08:16.290 --> 08:18.986
I THINK MONA WAS JUST
TRYING TO HELP.

08:19.030 --> 08:20.622
YOU SEND CARE PACKAGES

08:20.660 --> 08:23.265
WITH FRESH SOAP AND NEW
UNDERWEAR IF YOU WANT TO HELP;

08:23.300 --> 08:25.791
YOU DON'T VOLUNTEER TO
SPEND YOUR LIFE IN PRISON.

08:25.830 --> 08:27.536
WHATEVER MONA
WAS TRYING TO DO,

08:27.570 --> 08:29.663
SHE CERTAINLY GOT
JUDGE REILLY'S ATTENTION.

08:29.710 --> 08:32.599
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
I JUST RECEIVED AN EMAIL.

08:32.640 --> 08:34.130
NOT ONLY ARE YOU
NOT BEING TRANSFERRED,

08:34.180 --> 08:35.932
BUT MONA'S CONFESSION
CREATED ENOUGH DOUBT

08:35.980 --> 08:39.006
THAT SHE'S FINALLY AGREED
TO SET BAIL FOR YOU.

08:39.050 --> 08:41.541
TH EY--THEY DROPPED
THE CHARGES?

08:41.580 --> 08:43.548
NO, NOT UNLESS
THEY FIND SOMETHING

08:43.590 --> 08:44.648
TO CORROBORATE
HER CONFESSION.

08:46.320 --> 08:49.551
SO THE TRIAL IS
STILL MOVING FORWARD.

08:49.590 --> 08:51.922
AS OF NOW, YES.
BUT AT LEAST YOU CAN
WAIT FOR IT

08:51.960 --> 08:53.928
FROM YOUR OWN HOME.

08:56.200 --> 08:58.760
OH. THERE IS ONE MORE THING.

08:58.800 --> 09:02.167
SINCE WILDEN WAS
A POLICE OFFICER, THE BAIL
IS SET HIGHER THAN USUAL.

09:02.200 --> 09:04.566
HOW HIGH?

09:05.970 --> 09:07.528
A MILLION DOLLARS.

09:20.390 --> 09:22.312
SO THAT'S THE FULL TOUR.

09:22.360 --> 09:24.225
THE POOL IS AMAZING.

09:24.260 --> 09:26.649
I MEAN, YOUR FACILITIES
ARE REALLY OUTSTANDING.

09:26.700 --> 09:30.192
FIVE MINUTES.
THEN I WANT YOU CHANGED
AND HITTING THE WEIGHTS.

09:30.230 --> 09:32.664
THERE'S NO SLACKIN' HERE.
I CAN SEE THAT.

09:32.700 --> 09:34.065
EVERYONE'S IN GREAT SHAPE.

09:34.100 --> 09:35.692
PLEASE.

09:37.240 --> 09:39.333
SO YOUR FRIEND MENTIONED
YOU WERE THINKING OF

09:39.370 --> 09:41.736
HOLDING OFF COLLEGE
FOR A YEAR TO TRAIN.

09:41.780 --> 09:43.372
UH, I'M CONSIDERING IT.

09:43.410 --> 09:45.674
PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT.

09:45.710 --> 09:48.144
LET ME TELL YOU A LITTLE
ABOUT HOW I RUN THINGS.

09:48.180 --> 09:49.681
WE WORK OUT
SIX DAYS A WEEK.

09:49.720 --> 09:52.109
FOUR HOURS IN THE POOL,
ONE HOUR OF WEIGHT TRAINING.

09:52.150 --> 09:55.688
I ALSO MONITOR WHAT YOU EAT,
DRINK, AND HOW MUCH YOU SLEEP.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.358
HAVE I SCARED YOU YET?

09:57.390 --> 10:00.120
NO. NO, I'VE WORKED REALLY HARD
THE LAST FOUR YEARS,

10:00.160 --> 10:02.628
BOTH WITH THE TEAM
AND ON MY OWN.

10:02.670 --> 10:04.626
THAT'S GREAT,
BUT THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE

10:04.670 --> 10:07.093
BETWEEN BEING
A TOP HIGH SCHOOL SWIMMER
AND A CHAMPIONSHIP SWIMMER.

10:07.140 --> 10:08.698
I KNOW THE DIFFERENCE.

10:08.740 --> 10:11.129
LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT
YOUR RECRUITING VIDEO.

10:17.880 --> 10:19.711
DAD, I KNOW
IT'S A LOT OF MONEY,

10:19.750 --> 10:23.049
BUT YOU ONLY HAVE TO
PUT UP TEN PERCENT OF
THE MILLION DOLLARS.

10:23.090 --> 10:25.183
( chatter)

10:25.220 --> 10:28.712
YOU'VE SEEN WHERE SHE IS!
WE CAN'T LEAVE HER IN THERE!

10:28.760 --> 10:30.022
(crying )

10:30.060 --> 10:31.687
WELL, TRY HARDER.

10:34.200 --> 10:36.156
HAN NA?

10:37.300 --> 10:38.995
YOU ALL RIGHT?

10:39.030 --> 10:40.634
YEAH, I'M FINE.

10:42.770 --> 10:44.408
I LEI-T YOU
A FEW MESSAGES.

10:44.440 --> 10:45.862
YEAH, I KNOW.

10:45.910 --> 10:47.798
IT'S JUST WITH
EVERYTHING GOING ON...

10:47.840 --> 10:50.673
OF COURSE.
I UNDERSTAND.

10:53.780 --> 10:56.442
I THINK ABOUT YOUR MOM
ALL THE TIME.

10:56.480 --> 10:59.187
I MEAN, I WISH
THERE WAS SOMETHING
I COULD DO TO HELP HER.

10:59.220 --> 11:03.327
SHE ACTS LIKE SHE CAN
HANDLE BEING IN THERE.

11:03.360 --> 11:06.158
BUT I KNOW SHE'S TRYING TO
PUT UP A FRONT TO PROTECT ME.

11:06.190 --> 11:09.796
SHE'S A STRONG WOMAN, HANNA.
SHE'LL GET THROUGH THIS.

11:13.000 --> 11:16.333
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
IF I WILL.

11:16.370 --> 11:18.429
THEY CAN LEAVE HER
IN THERE FOREVER,

11:18.470 --> 11:23.100
AND IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
MY DAD'S GONNA COME UP WITH
A HUNDRED GRAND ANYTIME SOON.

11:23.150 --> 11:25.300
WHAT DO YOU NEED
THAT KIND OF MONEY FOR?

11:25.350 --> 11:27.944
IT'S WHAT SHE NEEDS
TO POST BAIL.

11:27.980 --> 11:29.982
CALEB'S TRYING
TO SELL HIS CAR,

11:30.020 --> 11:32.955
BUT IT'S NOT GONNA BE
NEARLY ENOUGH.

11:35.490 --> 11:39.051
YOU NEED TO HAVE FAITH
THINGS WILL WORK OUT.

11:39.090 --> 11:40.899
OKAY?

11:42.300 --> 11:44.495
I DON'T NEED FAITH.

11:44.530 --> 11:46.225
I NEED MONEY.

11:48.300 --> 11:49.699
( sighs )

11:53.110 --> 11:55.078
HOW LONG ARE YOU
GONNA BE GONE FOR?

11:55.110 --> 11:57.977
SHOULDN'T TAKE ME
MORE THAN FOUR OR FIVE DAYS
TO FIND AN APARTMENT.

11:58.010 --> 11:59.477
I ALREADY HAVE
A FEW LEADS.

11:59.510 --> 12:01.819
MAYBE MALCOLM COULD
STAY HERE WITH ME.

12:01.850 --> 12:03.738
THAT WAY HE DOESN'T
MISS ANY SCHOOL.

12:03.790 --> 12:05.382
I'M LOOKING AT TICKETS
FOR A SATURDAY,

12:05.420 --> 12:07.752
SO IT'LL ONLY BE
A DAY OR TWO.

12:07.790 --> 12:09.781
I'D REALLY PREFER
IF HE DIDN'T MISS ANY.

12:13.530 --> 12:15.418
I'LL DROP HIM OFF HERE
ON MY WAY TO THE AIRPORT.

12:15.460 --> 12:16.893
THANK YOU.

12:19.870 --> 12:21.838
HAVE YOU TALKED TO HIM
ABOUT MOVING YET?

12:21.870 --> 12:23.838
NOT YET.

12:23.870 --> 12:26.236
IT'S NOT GONNA BE EASY
FOR HIM, LEAVING ROSEWOOD.

12:26.270 --> 12:27.771
HE'S REALLY COMFORTABLE
HERE.

12:27.810 --> 12:30.005
HE'S A REALLY TOUGH KID.
HE'LL ADAPT.

12:30.050 --> 12:32.302
YOU'RE GONNA BE
SO BUSY WITH SCHOOL,

12:32.350 --> 12:34.045
AND HE'S NOT GONNA
KNOW ANYBODY OUT THERE.

12:34.080 --> 12:36.014
HE'S GOOD AT MAKING NEW FRIENDS.

12:37.590 --> 12:41.185
HE COULD ALWAYS
STAY HERE WITH ME.

12:42.320 --> 12:44.550
I MEAN, I HAVE MORE
FREE TIME THAN YOU.

12:44.590 --> 12:46.854
I'M NOT GONNA
LEAVE MY SON BEHIND, EZRA.

12:46.900 --> 12:48.549
HE NEEDS TO BE
WITH HIS MOTHER.

12:48.600 --> 12:51.524
AND IT'S EQUALLY IMPORTANT
FOR HIM TO SPEND TIME
WITH HIS FATHER.

12:51.570 --> 12:54.266
YES, BUT I'M THE ONE
WHO'S BEEN THERE FOR HIM
FOR THE PAST SEVEN YEARS.

12:54.300 --> 12:56.291
AND WHOSE FAULT IS THAT?

12:58.070 --> 13:00.868
YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S BEST
MALCOLM COMES WITH ME
NEXT WEEKEND.

13:00.910 --> 13:04.346
I'LL TALK TO HIS TEACHERS,
MAKE SURE HE DOESN'T MISS
ANY ASSIGNMENTS.

13:04.380 --> 13:07.543
( door opens, closes )

13:07.580 --> 13:09.275
HANNA'S CONVINCED
MONA DID ALL THIS

13:09.320 --> 13:10.878
AS A WAY TO RIGHT
ALL THE WRONGS.

13:10.920 --> 13:14.879
WHEN HAS MONA EVER DONE ANYTHING
OUT OF THE GOODNESS
OF HER HEART?
WHAT HEART?

13:14.920 --> 13:17.559
SHE TOLD THE POLICE
THAT WE BULLIED HER ONCE.
SHE COULD DO IT AGAIN.

13:17.590 --> 13:20.150
WHAT, LIKE WE FORCED HER
TO CONFESS?
YEAH.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.156
AND SHE STILL HAS THAT PICTURE
THAT "A" SENT

13:22.200 --> 13:24.498
OF THE FOUR OF US STANDING
OUTSIDE OF WILDEN'S CAR
THAT NIGHT.

13:24.530 --> 13:26.327
YEAH, BUT MONA
WAS THERE, TOO.

13:26.370 --> 13:27.962
NOT ACCORDING
TO THE PICTURE.

13:36.480 --> 13:38.471
CHECK IT OUT.
YOU TOOK THIS?

13:38.510 --> 13:40.876
YEAH, I TOOK IT
AT A MEET LAST YEAR.

13:42.480 --> 13:43.845
SHE'S GONNA LOVE IT.

13:45.890 --> 13:47.312
OKAY, WE SHOULD GO.

13:47.360 --> 13:49.578
I TOLD PAIGE WE'D BE
AT HER AUNT'S HOUSE
IN LIKE 20 MINUTES.

13:49.620 --> 13:50.689
WITH EVERYTHING
THAT'S GOING ON,

13:50.730 --> 13:53.198
I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY SHE'S THROWING THIS PARTY.

13:53.230 --> 13:55.619
EMILY'S BEEN LIVING
LIKE A REFUGEE
FOR DAYS NOW.

13:55.660 --> 13:58.197
I THINK PAIGE JUST THOUGHT
SHE AT LEAST DESERVED
A PIECE OF CAKE.

13:58.230 --> 14:02.189
Jenna: SHANA, THEY KNOW
I'M HIDING SOMETHING.

14:02.240 --> 14:04.606
IF THE COPS REALLY THOUGHT THAT,
YOU'D STILL BE THERE
ANSWERING QUESTIONS.

14:04.640 --> 14:06.198
I SHOULD HAVE TOLD THEM
ABOUT ALISON.

14:06.240 --> 14:08.208
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.

14:08.240 --> 14:11.004
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS
NOT TO SAY ANYTHING
AT THIS POINT!

14:11.050 --> 14:14.019
JUST GIVE ME
A LITTLE MORE TIME
TO FIGURE OUT WHERE SHE IS.

14:14.050 --> 14:16.075
I DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME LEI-T.

14:16.120 --> 14:19.009
I'M NOT LEAVING YOUR SIDE
UNTIL I TAKE YOU BACK
TO PHILLY IN THE MORNING.

14:19.050 --> 14:20.654
OKAY?

14:20.690 --> 14:22.658
THIS'LL ALL BE OVER SOON.

14:39.910 --> 14:42.037
( door opens, closes )

14:51.150 --> 14:53.254
YOUR MOTHER HAS
A GUARDIAN ANGEL.

14:53.290 --> 14:55.986
MY BAIL WAS POSTED
ANONYMOUSLY.

14:56.020 --> 14:58.386
I GUESS THAT'S HOW YOUR DAD
GOT AROUND ISABELLE.

14:58.430 --> 15:00.455
WELL,
AT LEAST HE DID IT.

15:02.030 --> 15:03.588
OKAY, SO WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO DO FIRST?

15:03.630 --> 15:05.188
YOU WANNA TAKE A BATH?
DO YOU WANNA EAT?

15:05.230 --> 15:07.391
I GOT ALL YCAVT FAVORITES.

15:07.440 --> 15:09.032
( beeping )
WHAT'S THAT?

15:09.070 --> 15:10.435
THAT...

15:10.470 --> 15:12.404
TRACKS WHERE I AM.

15:12.440 --> 15:13.668
EVERY SECOND OF THE DAY.

15:13.710 --> 15:15.575
IT'LL BEEP LIKE THAT
ONCE IN A WHILE

15:15.610 --> 15:18.204
WHEN IT LINKS
TO THE SATELLITE,
BUT YOU'LL GET USED TO IT.

15:18.250 --> 15:21.447
YEAH. I ASSURE YOU
IT'S NOT SOMETHING
I'M GONNA GET USED TO.

15:21.480 --> 15:23.209
JUST REMEMBER,
YOU CAN'T LEAVE THE HOUSE

15:23.250 --> 15:26.048
UNLESS IT'S FOR A COURT DATE
OR A MEDICAL APPOINTMENT.

15:27.490 --> 15:30.687
YOU THINK THIS THING WILL
DETECT A SIP OF CHARDONNAY?

15:30.730 --> 15:34.097
THAT THING WILL DETECT
A WHIFF OF CHARDONNAY.

15:34.130 --> 15:36.451
LOOK, I KNOW THAT
THESE RULES ARE UPSETTING,

15:36.500 --> 15:39.594
BUT IT'S BETTER THAN
THE ALTERNATIVE, RIGHT?

15:39.630 --> 15:41.495
THIS IS TRUE.

15:41.540 --> 15:43.565
VERONICA, THANK YOU
FOR EVERYTHING.

15:43.610 --> 15:44.963
YOU'RE WELCOME.

15:45.010 --> 15:47.035
TRY TO RELAX,
GET SOME SLEEP.

15:47.080 --> 15:49.275
I'LL CALL YOU TOMORROW,
OKAY?
OKAY.

15:51.480 --> 15:54.040
SHOULD WE CALL DAD
AND THANK HIM?

15:54.080 --> 15:54.910
AI-TER WE EAT.

15:54.950 --> 15:57.180
I HAVEN'T HAD A DECENT MEAL
IN DAYS.

15:57.220 --> 16:00.212
YOU DIDN'T GET A TATTOO
WHILE YOU WERE IN THERE,
DID YOU?

16:01.690 --> 16:03.578
( both laugh )

16:03.630 --> 16:06.087
Dominic:
YOU'RE PULLING
TOO MUCH WATER.

16:08.100 --> 16:10.989
AND THAT FLIP TOE
IS TOO FAR FROM THE WALL.

16:13.040 --> 16:18.000
I WON THIS RACE.
IT WAS ACTUALLY
MY BEST TIME ALL SEASON.

16:18.040 --> 16:21.771
YOU'VE GOT SOME BAD HABITS
AND YOUR TECHNIQUE COULD
USE SOME IMPROVEMENT.

16:21.810 --> 16:24.142
BUT YOU GOT
A LOT OF POTENTIAL.

16:24.180 --> 16:25.738
IF YOU'RE WILLING TO COMMIT,
I CAN HELP YOU.

16:25.780 --> 16:28.078
REALLY?
YES.

16:28.120 --> 16:30.088
BUT WE NEED TO START
RIGHT AWAY.

16:30.120 --> 16:31.485
WE'RE ALREADY BEHIND.

16:31.520 --> 16:34.489
YEAH, JUST AS SOON
AS MY SHOULDER HEALS.

16:34.520 --> 16:37.751
HEALS?
PAIGE DIDN'T TELL YOU?

16:37.790 --> 16:41.089
I TORE MY ROTATOR CUFF
A FEW WEEKS AGO.

16:41.130 --> 16:42.791
I MIGHT NEED SURGERY.

16:42.830 --> 16:45.765
EMILY, WITH AN INJURY LIKE THAT,
I WOULDN'T PUT YOU IN THE POOL

16:45.800 --> 16:47.438
FOR AT LEAST SIX MONTHS.

16:47.470 --> 16:49.631
THAT'S EVEN IF
YOU DON'T HAVE SURGERY.

16:49.670 --> 16:51.763
BUT YOU CAN STILL
HELP ME, RIGHT?

16:51.810 --> 16:53.698
AI-TER LOSING
THAT MUCH TIME,

16:53.740 --> 16:56.106
I CAN'T PROMISE THAT
YOU'LL BE READY FOR
NEXT YEAR'S SCHOLARSHIPS.

16:56.140 --> 16:59.041
OH. WHAT DO YOU THINK
THE ODDS ARE?

16:59.850 --> 17:02.114
SLIM.

17:02.150 --> 17:03.310
AT BEST.

17:05.290 --> 17:07.155
EMILY, I'M SORRY.

17:07.190 --> 17:10.125
HAD YOUR FRIEND TOLD ME
HOW SERIOUS THE INJURY WAS,

17:10.160 --> 17:12.025
I COULD HAVE SAVED YOU
THE TRIP DOWN HERE.

17:14.230 --> 17:15.629
YEAH.

17:19.300 --> 17:23.703
AM I CRAZY, OR DID IT SOUND LIKE
JENNA WAS SAYING SHE KNOWS
ALISON'S ALIVE?

17:23.740 --> 17:25.162
THAT OR SHE KNOWS
WHO KILLED HER.

17:25.210 --> 17:27.269
EITHER WAY,
THIS COULD LEAD TO "A"

17:27.310 --> 17:28.709
AND WHO'S SETTING UP
HANNA'S MOM.

17:28.740 --> 17:31.402
YEAH, BUT JENNA'S NOT
JUST GONNA TELL US.

17:31.450 --> 17:34.419
WELL, SHE MIGHT
IF WE COULD PRY HER
AWAY FROM SHANA.

17:34.450 --> 17:36.418
JENNA'S REALLY VULNERABLE
RIGHT NOW,

17:36.450 --> 17:38.315
AND NOT JUST BECAUSE
SHE'S LOSING HER SIGHT AGAIN.

17:38.350 --> 17:39.817
HOW DOES THAT
EVEN HAPPEN, ANYWAY?

17:39.850 --> 17:42.182
ONE MINUTE YOU HAVE IT,
THE NEXT MINUTE, POOF,
IT'S GONE?

17:42.220 --> 17:45.678
WELL, TOBY SAID THAT
THAT OPERATION HAS
A REALLY LOW SUCCESS RATE,

17:45.730 --> 17:49.154
SO APPARENTLY SHE'S ONE OF
THE UNFORTUNATE ONES.

17:49.200 --> 17:50.827
HEY, HAS TOBY HAD
ANY LUCK IN NEW YORK?

17:50.870 --> 17:53.191
HE TRACED THAT NUMBER
BACK TO AN EMPTY APARTMENT,

17:53.240 --> 17:55.834
AND THE LANDLORD SAID THAT
IT WAS RENTED OUT TO A GIRL.

17:55.870 --> 17:57.758
HE WOULDN'T GIVE THE NAME,
BUT HE DID GIVE
A FORWARDING ADDRESS.

17:57.810 --> 18:00.779
TO WHERE?
A P.O. BOX IN PHILLY.

18:00.810 --> 18:03.472
HE'S ON HIS WAY BACK
FROM NEW YORK RIGHT NOW.

18:03.510 --> 18:04.772
HEY.

18:06.750 --> 18:08.513
GUYS, EM'S GONNA
BE HERE AT 6:30.

18:08.550 --> 18:09.847
WE GOTTA HURRY UP.

18:09.880 --> 18:12.781
OH, DID YOU INVITE
THE WHOLE SWIM TEAM?

18:12.820 --> 18:15.186
YEAH. BUT DON'T WORRY,
SHANA WON'T SHOW UP.

18:15.220 --> 18:16.084
I MADE IT CLEAR
SHE WAS UNWELCOME.

18:16.120 --> 18:18.179
COULD YOU CALL HER
AND MAKE IT UNCLEAR?

18:18.230 --> 18:19.879
WE KIND OF NEED HER TO COME.

18:19.930 --> 18:21.852
WHY?

18:21.900 --> 18:23.492
BECAUSE UNTIL
TOMORROW MORNING,

18:23.530 --> 18:26.124
WHEREVER SHANA GOES,
JENNA GOES.

18:30.910 --> 18:32.866
SO SORRY TO BOTH ER YOU
AT HOME WITH THIS.

18:32.910 --> 18:35.674
DON'T BE. I UNDERSTAND
HOW UPSETTING THIS IS.

18:35.710 --> 18:39.339
NOW, I KNOW A LOT
OF FAMILY LAWYERS,
BUT GREG IS THE BEST.

18:39.380 --> 18:41.746
DO YOU THINK
I HAVE A CHANCE?

18:41.780 --> 18:46.217
IT'S NOT MY AREA OF EXPERTISE,
BUT I KNOW IT WON'T BE EASY.

18:46.250 --> 18:48.286
WHY IS THAT?
FOR ONE,

18:48.320 --> 18:50.754
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN INVOLVED IN
YOUR SON'S LIFE UNTIL RECENTLY.

18:50.790 --> 18:54.294
THAT'S BECAUSE
I DIDN'T KNOW HE EXISTED
UNTIL RECENTLY.

18:54.330 --> 18:58.767
AND TWO, YOU AREN'T LISTED
AS THE FATHER ON HIS
BIRTH CERTIFICATE.

18:58.800 --> 19:02.167
SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,

19:02.200 --> 19:04.236
THAT I DON'T HAVE ANY RIGHTS?

19:04.270 --> 19:06.636
NOT UNTIL YOU
ESTABLISH PATERNITY.

19:06.670 --> 19:09.275
BUT GREG CAN HELP YOU WITH THAT.

19:10.580 --> 19:14.368
CAN HE HELP ME PREVENT MAGGIE
FROM MOVING TO SEATTLE?

19:14.420 --> 19:17.912
IT'S POSSIBLE...
BUT IT'LL BE A BATTLE.

19:17.950 --> 19:20.851
ONE THAT WILL TAKE
TIME AND MONEY

19:20.890 --> 19:24.826
AND BE AN EMOTIONAL STRAIN
ON YOU AND MAGGIE.

19:24.860 --> 19:27.454
ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANT TO PURSUE THIS?

19:27.560 --> 19:29.289
I'M SURE.

19:30.000 --> 19:32.491
( recorded music plays )

19:34.240 --> 19:35.696
NO, NO, THEY'RE NOT HERE YET,

19:35.740 --> 19:37.605
BUT I'LL TEXT YOU
WHEN THEY SHOW UP, OKAY?

19:37.640 --> 19:39.961
AND GIVE YOUR MOM
A "WELCOME HOME" HUG
FOR ME. BYE.

19:40.010 --> 19:42.205
HI.
HI. WHERE'S SPENCER?

19:42.240 --> 19:43.741
UM, I DON'T KNOW.

19:43.780 --> 19:46.806
LAST TIME I SAW HER
SHE WAS TRYING TO STOP
TOMMY HAYES

19:46.850 --> 19:48.272
FROM POWER-DIPPING
THE GUACAMOLE.

19:48.320 --> 19:49.947
HUH. HELP ME GET
EVERYBODY HIDDEN?

19:49.980 --> 19:51.948
EMILY JUST TEXTED
SHE'LL BE HERE IN A MINUTE.

19:51.990 --> 19:53.582
YEAH, OF COURSE.
OKAY, YOU GUYS,
LET'S GO HIDE.

19:53.620 --> 19:55.212
SHE'S ALMOST HERE.
EVERYBODY.

19:57.330 --> 19:58.627
( music off)

20:08.470 --> 20:11.303
( car approaches )
Paige: OKAY, GUYS.

20:11.340 --> 20:12.432
SHE'S HERE.
EVERYBODY GET READY.

20:12.470 --> 20:13.801
SOMEBODY GET THE LIGHTS.

20:16.340 --> 20:17.739
( knocking on door)

20:18.810 --> 20:20.641
HEY, BIRTHDAY GIRL.

20:23.820 --> 20:25.310
EVERYTHING OKAY?

20:25.350 --> 20:26.988
WHY DID YOU LIE TO DOMINIC?

20:27.020 --> 20:29.716
A||: SURPRISE!!!

20:29.760 --> 20:32.024
( music starts )

20:41.400 --> 20:41.866
( music, party chatter)

20:45.040 --> 20:47.679
HEY, PAIGE,
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
WANT TO KNOW

20:47.710 --> 20:49.769
THAT BRIDGET WOO
IS IN YOUR KITCHEN.

20:49.810 --> 20:52.278
SHE'S TRYING TO MAKE A BONG
OUT OF YOUR AUNT'S TEAPOT.

20:56.050 --> 20:59.611
SO, DID YOU KNOW
PAIGE WAS GONNA
PLAN ALL THIS?

20:59.650 --> 21:02.619
NO. SHE'S BEEN FULL
OF SURPRISES LATELY.

21:02.660 --> 21:05.026
YEAH, WELL I'VE GOT
ANOTHER ONE FOR YOU.

21:12.830 --> 21:14.559
TED. HI.

21:15.740 --> 21:17.367
HI.

21:17.410 --> 21:19.628
HOW DID YOU KNOW
I WAS HOME?

21:19.670 --> 21:22.377
WORD TRAVELS FAST IN ROSEWOOD.

21:22.410 --> 21:23.672
OH.

21:25.850 --> 21:29.775
I JUST WANTED TO STOP BY,
WELCOME YOU BACK.

21:29.820 --> 21:31.845
YOU BROUGHT PIE.

21:31.890 --> 21:33.653
THANK YOU.

21:33.690 --> 21:36.386
I TRIED VISITING YOU,
BUT THEY WOULDN'T LET ME IN.

21:36.420 --> 21:40.424
THEY WERE HONORING
MY REQUEST. I DIDN'T
WANT TO SEE ANYONE.

21:42.130 --> 21:44.564
I WAS ASHAMED.

21:44.600 --> 21:46.329
YOU SHOULDN'T BE.

21:46.370 --> 21:48.930
YOU DIDN'T DESERVE
TO GO THROUGH THIS.

21:48.970 --> 21:51.564
THE THOUGHT OF YOU
BEING IN THERE IS...

21:54.140 --> 21:57.541
LOOK, I KNOW YOU HAVE
A LOT OF CATCHING UP TO DO
WITH HANNA,

21:57.580 --> 22:01.516
BUT WHEN YOU SETTLE IN,
I'D LOVE TO TAKE YOU TO DINNER.

22:03.020 --> 22:05.045
IT'LL HAVE TO BE
IN MY KITCHEN.

22:06.490 --> 22:08.458
HOW DO YOU LIKE
MY NEW ACCESSORY?

22:09.460 --> 22:10.620
( both chuckle )

22:10.660 --> 22:12.981
ANYTHING LOOKS GOOD ON YOU.

22:16.730 --> 22:18.527
DO YOU WANT TO
STAY FOR SOME PIE?

22:20.070 --> 22:21.537
SURE.

22:27.010 --> 22:29.433
PAIGE SAID THAT COACH FULTON
WAS GONNA BE HERE.

22:29.480 --> 22:31.641
I HAVE TO SHOW MY FACE.
I NEED TO STAY ON
HER GOOD SIDE.

22:31.680 --> 22:34.569
IT WAS HARD ENOUGH
COMING BACK TO THIS TOWN.
IN THE FIRST PLACE,

22:34.620 --> 22:36.440
AND NOW I HAVE TO
BE AROUND THEM?

22:36.480 --> 22:38.710
AND ME.

22:38.750 --> 22:41.150
I'LL BE WITH YOU
THE WHOLE TIME.

22:41.190 --> 22:42.282
WE'LL BE IN AND OUT.

22:46.160 --> 22:47.559
( music, chatter)

22:59.170 --> 23:01.673
HEY.
ARE YOU OKAY?

23:02.910 --> 23:04.070
YEAH.

23:06.510 --> 23:08.068
NO.

23:09.650 --> 23:11.186
JAKE'S HERE.

23:11.220 --> 23:14.018
I LIED TO HIM ABOUT
WHAT I WAS DOING TONIGHT.

23:14.060 --> 23:15.755
OOH.
WELL, WHERE IS HE?

23:15.790 --> 23:19.556
HE'S OVER THERE WITH
THAT BLOND WITH GIRAFFE LEGS.

23:19.590 --> 23:22.093
I DON'T EVEN RECOGNIZE HER.
WHO IS THAT?

23:22.130 --> 23:24.098
SHE'S ON THE SWIM TEAM.

23:24.130 --> 23:25.427
HUH.

23:25.470 --> 23:28.439
THEY CERTAINLY LOOK COZY.

23:28.470 --> 23:30.506
YEAH, SHE'S TRYING
REAL HARD.

23:30.540 --> 23:33.907
CLEARLY HE'S ENJOYING IT.
LOOK AT HIM.

23:33.940 --> 23:35.498
WHY DON'T YOU GO OVER THERE
AND TALK TO HIM?

23:35.540 --> 23:39.169
WHAT? AND INTERRUPT
THE FLIRT FEST? NO.

23:39.210 --> 23:43.442
UM, ARE YOU FORGETTING
THAT HE SPENT LAST NIGHT
ON YOU COUCH?

23:43.490 --> 23:47.085
YEAH, BUT HE CAME
TO THE PARTY WITH HER.

23:48.220 --> 23:50.450
I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T
THAT INTO HIM.

23:50.490 --> 23:51.422
I'M NOT.

23:54.560 --> 23:55.720
THEY'RE HERE.

24:20.990 --> 24:24.482
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL DOMINIC
I WAS INJURED?

24:24.530 --> 24:26.725
I WANTED TO MAKE SURE
HE'D SEE YOU.

24:32.270 --> 24:34.636
YOU KNOW...

24:34.670 --> 24:38.106
FOR A MINUTE THERE
I ACTUALLY THOUGHT

24:38.140 --> 24:41.109
MAYBE THIS COULD
HAPPEN FOR ME.

24:41.140 --> 24:43.700
MAYBE THINGS COULD GO BACK
TO THE WAY THEY WERE.

24:43.750 --> 24:48.870
IF HE WON'T TRAIN YOU,
WE CAN FIND SOMEONE WHO WILL.

24:48.920 --> 24:51.582
HE'LL TRAIN ME.

24:51.620 --> 24:54.282
HE JUST DOESN'T THINK
I'LL BE READY IN TIME
TO GET A SCHOLARSHIP.

24:54.320 --> 24:57.050
WE CAN GET
ANOTHER OPINION.

24:59.330 --> 25:01.890
WHY ARE YOU PUSHING THIS
SO MUCH?

25:01.930 --> 25:04.899
I KNOW HOW BADLY
YOU WANT TO SWIM.

25:04.930 --> 25:07.763
OR YOU MEAN HOW BADLY
YOU WANT ME TO SWIM?

25:18.350 --> 25:21.649
WHAT DO YOU THINK'S
GONNA HAPPEN IF I DON'T
GO TO STANFORD WITH YOU?

25:26.650 --> 25:29.289
THREE THOUSAND MILES
IS A LONG WAY.

25:29.320 --> 25:32.050
FOUR YEARS IS A LONG TIME.

25:35.600 --> 25:37.966
A LOT CAN HAPPEN.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.093
(crying )

25:41.800 --> 25:43.939
WE HAVE TO FACE FACTS.

25:49.810 --> 25:52.677
WE'RE NOT GONNA
BE TOGETHER NEXT YEAR.

25:57.080 --> 25:59.548
( both crying )

26:08.130 --> 26:11.668
IS YOUR COACH HERE?
NOT YET.

26:11.700 --> 26:13.588
WOW, LOOK WHO'S
BACK IN TOWN.

26:13.640 --> 26:16.359
IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU,
JENNA.

26:16.400 --> 26:19.665
ARIA. SPENCER.

26:19.710 --> 26:22.270
ARE YOU HAVING PROBLEMS
WITH YOUR EYES AGAIN?

26:22.310 --> 26:23.948
I SEE EVERYTHING
THAT I NEED TO.

26:23.980 --> 26:25.948
IS THERE SOMETHING
YOU GUYS WANT?

26:25.980 --> 26:28.710
YEAH, WE'RE GETTING
THE TEAM TOGETHER FOR
A PHOTO FOR EMILY.

26:28.750 --> 26:30.377
SO CAN YOU COME OUTSIDE?

26:30.420 --> 26:33.583
WHEN EVERYONE ELSE IS THERE,
WE'LL COME OUT.

26:34.720 --> 26:35.812
OKAY.

26:35.860 --> 26:37.657
COOL.

26:39.930 --> 26:42.694
YOU KEEP AN EYE ON THEM
AND I'LL GET EVERYBODY OUTSIDE.

26:42.730 --> 26:43.924
OKAY.

26:45.930 --> 26:47.363
Ashley: WELL,
IF YOU MUST KNOW...

26:47.400 --> 26:50.233
HEY, DAD. I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU GOT MY EARLIER TEXT,

26:50.270 --> 26:53.364
BUT I JUST WANT TO
THANK YOU AGAIN FOR
HELPING MOM,

26:53.410 --> 26:56.038
SO CALL ME BACK
WHEN YOU GET THIS.

26:56.080 --> 26:57.741
I LOVE YOU. BYE.

26:59.150 --> 27:00.742
( phone rings )

27:06.750 --> 27:08.251
HEY.

27:08.290 --> 27:11.327
I'VE BEEN CALLING YOU ALL DAY.
ARE YOU OKAY?
I WILL BE.

27:11.360 --> 27:13.328
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THEY LET YOU GO.

27:13.360 --> 27:15.396
THEY NEED PROOF, HANNA,
BEFORE THEY CAN ARREST ME.

27:15.430 --> 27:17.990
PEOPLE MAKE FALSE
CONFESSIONS ALL THE TIME.

27:18.030 --> 27:20.021
MONA, WHY DID YOU DO THIS?

27:20.070 --> 27:22.391
SORRY, I CAN'T CHAT.
I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE ON THE PHONE.

27:22.440 --> 27:24.761
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE
YOUR MOM GOT OUT ON BAIL.

27:24.810 --> 27:27.267
YEAH. YEAH, SHE'S HOME, BUT--

27:27.310 --> 27:29.073
YOU'RE WELCOME.

27:29.110 --> 27:30.907
( disconnects )

27:43.360 --> 27:45.658
( music, chatter)

27:49.860 --> 27:51.760
HEY.

27:51.800 --> 27:52.698
JAKE.

27:52.730 --> 27:54.664
HI.

27:56.140 --> 27:58.438
FAMILY MOVIE NIGHT, HUH?
LOOK, YA KNOW,

27:58.470 --> 28:02.201
WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S
GOING ON, I TOTALLY SPACED
ABOUT EMILY'S PARTY.

28:02.240 --> 28:04.299
YEAH, ALL RIGHT.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIE.

28:04.350 --> 28:05.942
NO, I DIDN'T LIE.

28:05.980 --> 28:09.040
IT'S NOT LIKE
YOU HAD TO INVITE ME.
WE'RE NOT DATING.

28:09.080 --> 28:11.810
IT COMPLETELY
SLIPPED MY MIND. HONESTLY.

28:16.890 --> 28:20.678
SO... WHO'S BARBARELLA
OVER THERE?

28:23.030 --> 28:25.362
NAME'S KIM.
SHE'S PRETTY.

28:25.400 --> 28:28.289
IF YOU'RE INTO THE TALL,
STATUESQUE MODEL TYPE.

28:30.540 --> 28:31.962
YOU OKAY?

28:32.010 --> 28:34.433
YEAH. I'M PERFECT.

28:36.240 --> 28:39.471
LOOKS LIKE THE TWO OF YOU
HAVE BEEN HAVING A GREAT TIME
TOGETHER.

28:39.510 --> 28:43.116
WAIT. SO YOU DON'T WANT ME
TO GO THE PARTY WITH YOU,

28:43.150 --> 28:45.744
BUT YOU DON'T WANT ME TO GO
WITH ANYONE ELSE?

28:45.790 --> 28:48.486
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
YOU'RE NOT JEALOUS?

28:48.520 --> 28:51.125
WHY WOULD I BE?
WE'RE NOT DATING.

28:53.800 --> 28:55.859
YEAH, RIGHT.

28:55.900 --> 28:58.323
WE'RE JUST FRIENDS.

28:59.900 --> 29:01.868
( phone rings )

29:05.570 --> 29:08.437
I...NEED TO GO
FIND SPENCER.

29:11.180 --> 29:13.501
YEAH, I...

29:13.550 --> 29:15.871
SHOULD GET BACK TO KIM.

29:35.840 --> 29:38.866
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO
CAME TO SEE YOU HERE TONIGHT.

29:38.910 --> 29:42.903
THINK YOU CAN BACK INSIDE
AND AT LEAST PRETEND
TO HAVE A GOOD TIME?

29:47.920 --> 29:51.344
YEAH. I CAN DO THAT.

30:04.070 --> 30:06.891
WE'VE BEEN HERE
FOR OVER HALF AN HOUR.
CAN WE PLEASE LEAVE?

30:06.930 --> 30:08.488
I HAVEN'T SEEN COACH YET.

30:08.540 --> 30:12.237
YOUR TEAMMATES CAN TELL HER
THAT YOU STOPPED BY. PLEASE?

30:12.270 --> 30:13.908
PLEASE.
YEAH.

30:13.940 --> 30:15.771
OKAY. LET'S GO.

30:19.650 --> 30:22.073
JENNA. I NEED TO
TALK TO YOU BEFORE YOU LEAVE.

30:22.120 --> 30:24.588
ALONE.
ABOUT WHAT?

30:24.620 --> 30:26.918
ALISON.
JENNA, LET'S GO.

30:26.950 --> 30:28.588
I HEARD YOU TALKING ABOUT HER
AT SCHOOL TODAY.

30:28.620 --> 30:29.917
YOU WERE SPYING ON US?

30:29.960 --> 30:31.257
WE'RE OUT OF HERE.

30:31.290 --> 30:33.588
JENNA, WAIT.

30:33.630 --> 30:36.190
LOOK, I KNOW EXACTLY
HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT ME,

30:36.230 --> 30:37.595
BUT ALI WAS MY BEST FRIEND,

30:37.630 --> 30:39.860
SO IF YOU KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT HER,
YOU HAVE TO TELL ME.

30:39.900 --> 30:42.960
I DON'T HAVE TO
TELL YOU ANYTHING.
Paige: TIME FOR CAKE!

30:50.010 --> 30:51.443
Shana:
JENNA, WAIT!

30:56.980 --> 31:00.882
THAT WAS DELICIOUS.
DID YOU MAKE THAT YOURSELF?

31:00.920 --> 31:03.923
WITH SOME DIVINE
INTERVENTION.
BELMONT BAKERY.

31:06.130 --> 31:07.620
YOU WASH, I'LL DRY?

31:07.660 --> 31:10.629
YOU KNOW, I'M ACTUALLY
LOOKING FORWARD TO
DOING BOTH.

31:10.660 --> 31:12.366
AH.

31:12.400 --> 31:15.096
I SHOULD GET GOING.
LET YOU GET SOME REST.

31:15.140 --> 31:19.668
WELL, BEFORE YOU DO,
I THINK I OWE YOU
AN EXPLANATION.

31:19.710 --> 31:22.634
YOU DON'T OWE ME ANYTHING.

31:22.680 --> 31:25.547
I WANT TO EXPLAIN.

31:28.150 --> 31:30.277
WILDEN AND I
HAD A HISTORY.

31:31.690 --> 31:34.158
I DID SOME THINGS
I'M NOT PROUD OF.

31:35.560 --> 31:38.120
THINGS...HE KNEW ABOUT,

31:38.160 --> 31:40.253
AND HE...

31:40.290 --> 31:43.396
HE TRIED TO USE THEM
TO HURT ME AND HANNA.

31:43.430 --> 31:46.399
HE WAS A CORRUPT COP, ASHLEY.

31:46.430 --> 31:49.536
I SAW HIM...
THE NIGHT HE WAS MURDERED.

31:49.570 --> 31:50.662
WE HAD AN ARGUMENT.

31:50.700 --> 31:52.634
I KNOW YOU DIDN'T KILL HIM.

31:53.980 --> 31:56.676
NO, I DIDN'T. BUT--

31:56.710 --> 31:58.905
I COULD HAVE.

32:05.050 --> 32:07.086
EVERYONE HAS THEIR LIMITS.

32:14.330 --> 32:15.524
C'MERE.

32:27.540 --> 32:31.078
CAN I DROP OFF DINNER
FOR YOU AND HANNA
TOMORROW NIGHT?

32:33.210 --> 32:34.939
ONLY IF YOU STAY
AND EAT WITH US.

32:36.520 --> 32:38.488
IT'S A DATE.

32:38.520 --> 32:40.078
OKAY.

32:43.120 --> 32:45.623
OH. UM,
JUST DO ME A FAVOR.

32:47.090 --> 32:50.355
DON'T RUN. I'VE GOT A LOT
RIDING ON YOU.

32:56.370 --> 32:59.965
( door opens, closes )

33:02.110 --> 33:04.146
( chatter)

33:05.650 --> 33:06.548
HEY, HAVE YOU
SEEN SPENCER?

33:06.580 --> 33:09.140
YEAH, SHE WENT OUTSIDE
TO LOOK FOR JENNA.

33:10.780 --> 33:12.418
I'LL COME WITH YOU.
OKAY.

33:22.730 --> 33:24.129
SPENCER?

33:31.670 --> 33:34.230
HI.
HEY.

33:34.280 --> 33:36.100
ARE YOU HEADIN' OUT ALREADY?

33:36.140 --> 33:38.449
YEAH. GOTTA GET UP
EARLY TOMORROW.

33:38.480 --> 33:40.141
HMM.

33:40.850 --> 33:42.772
WHERE'S KIM?

33:42.820 --> 33:45.380
INSIDE. SAYING GOODBYE
TO A COUPLE OF PEOPLE.

33:45.420 --> 33:47.786
SHE'LL BE OUT
IN A MINUTE.

33:47.820 --> 33:49.185
Aria: AWESOME.

33:55.830 --> 33:57.422
OH, MY GOD!

33:57.460 --> 33:59.462
Aria: WHAT IS IT?

33:59.500 --> 34:01.468
SPENCER!!!

34:01.500 --> 34:03.036
OH, MY GOD!

34:08.610 --> 34:09.736
JENNA.

34:22.320 --> 34:24.379
Shana: JENNA! OH, MY GOD!

34:26.260 --> 34:27.818
I THOUGHT SHE WAS INSIDE!

34:27.860 --> 34:29.828
WHAT HAPPENED?

34:29.860 --> 34:31.225
Guy:
GET A PHONE!

34:31.270 --> 34:32.589
SHE'S NOT BREATHING!

34:37.500 --> 34:38.467
Shana: SHE CAN BARELY SEE.
THERE'S NO WAY SHE'D WALK

34:39.870 --> 34:42.100
ALL THE WAY OVER
TO THE LAKE ON HER OWN.

34:45.480 --> 34:47.698
DID SOMEBODY
PUSH HER IN?

34:47.750 --> 34:49.638
I THINK SOMEBODY
HIT HER FIRST.

34:49.680 --> 34:52.217
THERE WAS BLOOD ON
THE BACK OF HER HEAD.

35:10.270 --> 35:12.465
( siren wails )

35:12.510 --> 35:15.479
WHAT? IS SHE GONNA BE OKAY?

35:15.510 --> 35:17.876
WHAT HOSPITAL
DID THEY TAKE HER TO?

35:17.910 --> 35:19.275
( knock on door)

35:19.310 --> 35:21.517
I GOTTA GO. I'LL CALL YOU
IN THE MORNING.

35:22.650 --> 35:24.743
HEY. WHO YOU TALKIN' TO
SO LATE?

35:24.790 --> 35:27.145
OH. I WAS JUST WISHING EMILY
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

35:31.860 --> 35:35.626
LISTEN, I JUST
GOT OFF THE PHONE
WITH YOUR FATHER.

35:35.660 --> 35:38.527
I THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW:
HE DIDN'T PUT UP THE BAIL MONEY.

35:41.440 --> 35:43.192
IT WAS TED.

35:44.710 --> 35:45.859
TED.

35:49.280 --> 35:52.169
WOW. HE MUST...
REALLY LIKE YOU

35:52.210 --> 35:53.871
TO PUT UP
THAT KIND OF MONEY.

35:55.550 --> 35:57.415
I GUESS SO.

36:04.960 --> 36:07.554
SO WHAT'S GONNA
HAPPEN NEXT?

36:09.630 --> 36:12.827
WE CAN THINK ABOUT THAT
TOMORROW.

36:21.780 --> 36:24.943
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU WERE THE ONE WHO SAVED
JENNA MARSHALL.

36:24.980 --> 36:26.345
WHO WOULD DO THIS TO HER?

36:26.380 --> 36:28.473
WE DON'T ANYONE DID
FOR SURE.

36:31.890 --> 36:33.983
SHE HAD A GASH ON
THE BACK OF HER HEAD, PAIGE.

36:34.020 --> 36:36.454
SHE COULD HAVE FALLEN IN,
HIT HER HEAD ON A ROCK.

36:36.490 --> 36:40.449
I THINK SOMEONE WANTED TO MAKE
SURE WE DIDN'T FIND OUT
WHAT SHE KNOWS ABOUT ALISON.

36:47.870 --> 36:50.338
THANKS FOR COMING OVER.

36:50.370 --> 36:52.008
THAN KS.

36:52.040 --> 36:55.498
I KEEP THINKING
IF EMILY HAD PULLED
THAT GIRL OUT

36:55.540 --> 36:57.235
JUST A COUPLE OF SECONDS
LATER,

36:57.280 --> 36:59.271
SHE PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE HERE.

37:01.480 --> 37:03.243
I KNEW YOUR LIFE
WAS COMPLICATED,

37:03.280 --> 37:05.680
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW
IT WAS ANYTHING LIKE THIS.

37:11.360 --> 37:13.954
I'VE HAD A LONG HISTORY
WITH MONA AND JENNA.

37:17.500 --> 37:19.320
IF I EXPLAINED EVERYTHING,

37:19.370 --> 37:21.895
WE'D BE HERE
TILL I GRADUATED.

37:24.570 --> 37:27.368
I'M STARTING TO SEE WHY
YOU'RE SO ON EDGE
ALL THE TIME.

37:29.640 --> 37:31.505
I FEEL SAFE
WHEN I'M WITH YOU, THOUGH.

37:33.450 --> 37:37.318
AND I'M SORRY
IF I RUINED YOUR NIGHT
OR ANYTHING.

37:38.920 --> 37:40.785
KIM'S JUST A FRIEND,
ARIA.

37:44.790 --> 37:49.625
LOOK, I WAS REALLY GLAD
WHEN YOU STAYED OVER, AND...

37:49.660 --> 37:52.322
YEAH, I WAS PRETTY JEALOUS
TONIGHT.

37:54.070 --> 37:58.359
I-I JUST--I DON'T SEE
HOW I CAN INVOLVE ANYONE ELSE
IN MY LIFE RIGHT NOW,

37:58.410 --> 38:00.560
IT'S LIKE I'M EITHER
SPINNING IN CIRCLES

38:00.610 --> 38:03.272
OR I'M IN A CONSTANT
STATE OF FREE-FALL.

38:05.080 --> 38:09.312
MAYBE YOU CAN LET SOMEONE ELSE
HELP YOU NAVIGATE FOR A WHILE.

38:09.350 --> 38:11.716
SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

38:17.420 --> 38:19.422
OKAY, YEAH.

38:20.960 --> 38:22.689
MAYBE I COULD.

38:24.430 --> 38:26.364
YA KNOW, AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

38:28.470 --> 38:30.961
SO ON A SCALE
FROM ONE TO TEN,

38:31.000 --> 38:33.309
HOW JEALOUS
WERE YOU TONIGHT?

39:01.600 --> 39:02.737
EMILY.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.763
EM, ARE YOU ASLEEP?

39:21.150 --> 39:23.880
HEY. HAVE YOU
SEEN TOBY?

39:23.920 --> 39:27.481
HE'S WITH HIS PARENTS,
TALKING TO THE DOCTOR.

39:27.530 --> 39:30.021
I'M WAITING TO SEE HER.
SHE'S STILL NOT CONSCIOUS.

39:31.200 --> 39:33.998
HEY.
WHO DID THIS TO HER?

39:34.030 --> 39:36.999
ALL I KNOW IS NOTHING GOOD
EVERY COMES FROM BEING
AROUND YOU FOUR.

39:37.040 --> 39:39.600
PLEASE. SHANA--

39:39.640 --> 39:41.164
YOU COULD BE NEXT.

39:41.210 --> 39:43.678
OR ME.

39:43.710 --> 39:46.008
WAS IT ALI?

39:46.050 --> 39:49.076
ALISON? SHE'S DEAD.

39:53.120 --> 39:55.611
WELL, THEN WHO IS JENNA
SO AFRAID OF?

39:55.660 --> 39:57.457
SHANA!

39:59.060 --> 40:01.381
CECE DRAKE.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.992

41:43.900 --> 41:46.562
( slurring notes together )

41:56.240 --> 41:59.573
