00:00.835 --> 00:03.237
- Previously on The Strain...
- You find it

00:03.271 --> 00:04.472
a bit of an insult

00:04.505 --> 00:06.307
that you're being asked to be

00:06.340 --> 00:09.844
a baby vessel?
I want you to work for me,

00:09.878 --> 00:12.446
be my special liaison
between myself and the ward.

00:12.480 --> 00:14.515
- So you want me
to be the mouthpiece

00:14.548 --> 00:16.851
for your bullshit?
- Excuse me?

00:16.885 --> 00:20.354
- It seems your operation
has expanded.

00:20.388 --> 00:23.091
- Yeah, I got a new partner now.
You remember Creem?

00:23.124 --> 00:25.994
- If you could find a way
to put something poisonous

00:26.027 --> 00:28.596
into their blood,
you could take out thousands

00:28.629 --> 00:30.464
of strigoi and they wouldn't
know what hit them.

00:30.498 --> 00:32.667
- Over 2,000 of our brethren

00:32.701 --> 00:34.869
were poisoned. Tainted blood

00:34.903 --> 00:36.938
from one of our trucks.

00:36.971 --> 00:39.273
- These are all towns
in Pennsylvania.

00:39.307 --> 00:42.443

00:42.476 --> 00:46.014

01:35.396 --> 01:37.431
- I'm not hungry.

01:42.703 --> 01:45.907
- You know,

01:45.940 --> 01:49.043
this is the only normal hour

01:49.077 --> 01:52.580
of my day. If you could
at least pretend to...

01:52.613 --> 01:55.349
to have a good time...
- There's nothing normal

01:55.383 --> 01:58.719
about having armed guards
watching you eat.

02:03.291 --> 02:05.860
- You know what?
What do you want me to do?

02:05.894 --> 02:08.529
This is the safest room in the
whole goddamn city for humans.

02:08.562 --> 02:10.799
Do I ask anything
in return? No.

02:10.832 --> 02:13.201

where we just pretend that...

02:17.471 --> 02:19.440

02:19.473 --> 02:21.910
- Mr. Eichhorst.

02:23.778 --> 02:26.747
You-you know...
you know my wife, Selah?

02:26.781 --> 02:28.783
- Frau Desai,
of course.

02:30.418 --> 02:32.620
- I'll give you two some
privacy. - No, no, no.

02:32.653 --> 02:35.456
Please, stay.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.158
Don't mind me. Eat.

02:43.197 --> 02:45.099
I insist.

02:49.003 --> 02:50.905
I stopped
by your office

02:50.939 --> 02:54.642
and was surprised
you weren't there.

02:54.675 --> 02:57.345
I trust this means
everything is in order.

02:57.378 --> 02:59.680
- Yes, actually. It is.

02:59.713 --> 03:01.782
Ahem! The delivery room
is fully equipped.

03:01.816 --> 03:03.784
Staff all been briefed.

03:03.818 --> 03:05.920
We've taken
every possible measure

03:05.954 --> 03:08.456
to ensure the safety
and well-being of the mother.

03:08.489 --> 03:11.425
- Excellent.

03:11.459 --> 03:13.461
And afterwards?

03:15.629 --> 03:17.465
Ahem! Well, it's...

03:17.498 --> 03:19.767
as... as we discussed.

03:19.800 --> 03:23.271
- I'm not talking
about the baby, Mr. Desai,

03:23.304 --> 03:25.473
I am talking
about the mothers.

03:25.506 --> 03:27.341
Everything is going

03:27.375 --> 03:30.278
to change the moment
this first child is born.

03:30.311 --> 03:33.181
Surely, you have a plan

03:33.214 --> 03:35.716
for dealing
with their reactions.

03:35.749 --> 03:39.387
- Honestly, sir, I don't see
how it's gonna be so different.

03:39.420 --> 03:42.823
- Perhaps you should have
your wife explain it

03:42.857 --> 03:45.559
to you.

03:47.228 --> 03:50.231
Or perhaps I take
something important from you

03:50.264 --> 03:53.567
to help you
better understand.

03:53.601 --> 03:57.338
- That won't be necessary, sir.
- Good. Because I confess

03:57.371 --> 04:01.142
I'm more than a little
disappointed in your progress.

04:01.175 --> 04:03.177
- We're delivering
our first baby nine months

04:03.211 --> 04:05.179
almost to the day.

04:05.213 --> 04:07.882
I don't know how we could have
done it any faster or better.

04:07.916 --> 04:10.584
- No? Well...

04:12.686 --> 04:15.056
...what if you harvested

04:15.089 --> 04:17.058
the babies earlier?

04:17.091 --> 04:20.728
Say, seven or eight months
instead of nine?

04:20.761 --> 04:22.830
Perhaps even
as early as six

04:22.863 --> 04:25.266
provided it's
an acceptable size.

04:26.700 --> 04:29.070
- I think I'm going to leave--
- SIT!

04:31.205 --> 04:34.342
Then, if you shorten
the recovery time

04:34.375 --> 04:36.844
for the mothers,
each of them would produce

04:36.877 --> 04:40.181
nearly two babies per year
instead of one.

04:40.214 --> 04:43.084
That would almost double
your output, would it not?

04:45.086 --> 04:47.288
- It's highly optimistic

04:47.321 --> 04:50.024
and well outside
the margins for safety.

04:50.058 --> 04:51.825
- Yes.

04:57.598 --> 05:00.201
- But, yes,

05:00.234 --> 05:02.136
it's possible.

05:02.170 --> 05:04.572
- Shall I do more
of your thinking for you?

05:04.605 --> 05:06.975
- No, sir.
- Good.

05:07.008 --> 05:11.545

They've built up
all this infrastructure

29:18.725 --> 29:20.827
for The Partnership, but they
haven't been maintaining it.

29:20.860 --> 29:24.196
They stopped repurposing materials
and repairing vehicles.

29:24.230 --> 29:26.198
- Now they're rounding up
the workforce,

29:26.232 --> 29:29.902
shipping them out.
The question is where?

29:29.936 --> 29:31.904
- I don't know,

29:31.938 --> 29:33.940
but I can tell you one thing:

29:33.973 --> 29:35.975
I bet it doesn't look
exactly like this.

29:38.244 --> 29:40.513
- Yeah.

29:40.547 --> 29:42.915
- I followed 'em back
to an old NYPD armory.

29:42.949 --> 29:44.917
They've got two men
guarding the front door,

29:44.951 --> 29:47.119
it's reinforced steel,
and at least four more inside,

29:47.153 --> 29:49.121
maybe more.
- Armed?

29:49.155 --> 29:51.290
- Definitely. With all the stuff
they got in there,

29:51.323 --> 29:53.292
this will be
the score of the century.

29:53.325 --> 29:56.395
- So let's go take it.
What's the problem?

29:56.429 --> 29:58.397
- The problem is
they're ex-cops.

29:58.431 --> 30:00.399
I recognize 'em
from the neighborhood.

30:00.433 --> 30:02.769
One of 'em is
a beat cop named Flores;

30:02.802 --> 30:05.071
the other's a bitch-ass
lieutenant named Ricci.

30:05.104 --> 30:06.806
- How many total?
- Six.

30:06.839 --> 30:08.608
- Easy.

30:08.641 --> 30:10.910
We take out the guards,
go in through the front,

30:10.943 --> 30:12.912
hit 'em with everything
we got. I mean,

30:12.945 --> 30:15.448
they can't kill us all, right?
- You wanna bet? -That's right.

30:15.482 --> 30:17.316
- Look, they're ex-cops.

30:17.349 --> 30:19.486
That means they're highly
trained and armed to the teeth.

30:19.519 --> 30:21.588
We gotta be smart
about this.

30:21.621 --> 30:24.491
- So what's your plan?
- All right.

30:24.524 --> 30:28.160
We go in through this tunnel.
There's a section of ductwork

30:28.194 --> 30:31.397
that leads up and through the back wall.
- Hell with that. We're not

30:31.430 --> 30:33.466
crawling in on our bellies like
a bunch a goddamn cockroaches.

30:33.500 --> 30:35.735
When they came
into our place,

30:35.768 --> 30:38.270
they disrespected us.
- That's right.

30:38.304 --> 30:41.007
- We're going through
the front, like men.

30:41.040 --> 30:43.175
- That's right.
- Wanna bum-rush the front door?

30:43.209 --> 30:45.144
That's fine by me.

30:45.177 --> 30:46.946
But what are you gonna do
about the trip wire?

30:46.979 --> 30:50.016
- What trip wire?
- Exactly.

30:50.049 --> 30:51.918
We don't have any idea
what's waiting for us

30:51.951 --> 30:53.853
behind that front door. And
I don't wanna be the first one

30:53.886 --> 30:57.189
down that hallway. Do you?
- Not me. - Good point.

31:00.660 --> 31:02.662
- Anybody else
wanna volunteer?

31:02.695 --> 31:04.831
- Mm-mm.

31:10.737 --> 31:14.541
- All right. We'll go in
through the tunnel then. Shit!

31:14.574 --> 31:17.276
- Now, this is not
gonna be a cakewalk,

31:17.309 --> 31:19.612

31:19.646 --> 31:21.948

that killed Rafi.

31:32.191 --> 31:35.662

be the easiest way into the tunnel.
