00:00.156 --> 00:02.867
I'm here at Madison High
in Maplewood, New Jersey,

00:02.906 --> 00:05.156
where ninth grader Rachel Klein
isn't bringing

00:05.219 --> 00:07.523
just any date
to her school dance tonight.

00:07.593 --> 00:10.881
She is bringing singing
sensation ChaseDreams.

00:10.950 --> 00:12.416
<i>Chase posted he was coming</i>

00:12.485 --> 00:14.251
<i>to his 10 million followers</i>

00:14.320 --> 00:17.021
<i>so fans from all over the tristate area</i>

00:17.090 --> 00:19.556
<i>came out just to catch a glimpse.</i>

00:19.625 --> 00:22.559
And it looks like Chase
is pulling up now.

00:22.628 --> 00:24.895
The fans are going crazy.

00:24.964 --> 00:26.730
It's a little scary to be honest.

00:29.168 --> 00:31.402
He's walking in with his lucky date

00:31.471 --> 00:35.105
and what appears to be
an old Backstreet Boy.

00:35.173 --> 00:38.359
And now a second SUV has pulled up.

00:38.407 --> 00:40.840
Did Chase bring some celeb friends?

00:43.055 --> 00:46.357
Oh, no. Never mind. It's his parents.

00:46.393 --> 00:50.028
And it looks like they had him old.

00:52.204 --> 00:54.304
Thank you for coming.
This is will be such

00:54.373 --> 00:55.638
a special night for the students.

00:55.707 --> 00:57.707
Well, Chase is so happy to be here.

00:57.776 --> 00:59.009
Oh, my God, that reminds me.

00:59.077 --> 01:00.676
I gotta get him out of the wall.

01:00.745 --> 01:02.279
- What?
- Yeah, I knew the fans

01:02.347 --> 01:04.980
out front would be real crazy,
so I snuck him in

01:05.049 --> 01:06.715
through the ventilation system.

01:10.487 --> 01:11.820
I think a mouse bit me.

01:11.889 --> 01:13.588
That's Hollywood, baby!

01:13.657 --> 01:15.084
Oh, my God.

01:15.146 --> 01:16.631
Um, Streeter, when you said
you were gonna

01:16.701 --> 01:18.123
sneak him in I thought you meant like

01:18.178 --> 01:19.728
- through the back.
- Oh, this is what

01:19.797 --> 01:21.964
the hottest celebrities do.
They crawl through the walls,

01:22.033 --> 01:24.300
and then they have a decoy
come in the front.

01:24.368 --> 01:26.168
Speaking of which, great job, Lorraine.

01:26.237 --> 01:28.037
Hey, if you're happy, I'm happy.

01:28.105 --> 01:29.905
Isn't this unbelievable?

01:29.974 --> 01:32.074
I found her about two hours ago online.

01:32.143 --> 01:34.775
She is a handful, but they're
basically the same height.

01:34.844 --> 01:36.744
Okay, well thank you, Lorraine.

01:36.813 --> 01:39.080
You can just go ahead
and wait in the car.

01:39.149 --> 01:41.082
Are you sure you don't need
me to stick around

01:41.151 --> 01:44.352
and play other roles? I'm also an actor.

01:44.421 --> 01:46.921
- Oh, no.
- I do accents, impressions.

01:46.990 --> 01:48.990
I have some costumes in the car.

01:49.059 --> 01:52.260
That's okay. Thank you, Lorraine.

01:52.329 --> 01:56.864
Then good eve, my lords and ladies.

01:56.933 --> 01:59.033
- British.
- I could have sworn

01:59.102 --> 02:00.534
that was French, but then when she said

02:00.603 --> 02:02.036
British I was like, "Yep."

02:02.105 --> 02:04.072
Okay, well let's get you two lovebirds

02:04.140 --> 02:06.873
out on the dance floor 'cause
we gotta be out of here in...

02:06.942 --> 02:08.140
45.

02:08.210 --> 02:09.642
- Wait, we do?
- Yep.

02:09.711 --> 02:11.811
Chase got an invite to the launch party

02:11.880 --> 02:13.350
of Lil Wayne's new tequila.

02:13.375 --> 02:14.508
I really want to meet him.

02:14.576 --> 02:16.243
I mean, Chase wants to meet him.

02:16.311 --> 02:19.312
He can't even drink. He's 13.

02:19.381 --> 02:21.481
Ages are for regular people, okay?

02:21.550 --> 02:23.116
He's a singer.

02:23.185 --> 02:24.651
What are we talking about here?

02:24.719 --> 02:27.487
Oh, sorry. I gotta take this.
It's my agent.

02:27.556 --> 02:29.356
Cary, I've got some good news,

02:29.425 --> 02:30.857
and I've got some bad news.

02:30.926 --> 02:32.059
<i>The good news is</i>

02:32.127 --> 02:33.293
I submitted you for the lead

02:33.362 --> 02:34.661
in the next Marvel movie.

02:34.729 --> 02:36.329
What? That's...

02:36.398 --> 02:37.830
That's insane. Thank you, Skip.

02:37.899 --> 02:39.465
The bad news is

02:39.534 --> 02:41.801
they said that's not
the way it works, okay?

02:41.870 --> 02:43.670
They don't just take
submissions for that.

02:43.738 --> 02:45.071
Then why did you call me?

02:45.139 --> 02:46.238
I thought you called me.

02:46.307 --> 02:47.974
Good-bye, Skip.

02:48.043 --> 02:49.508
Okay, buh-bye.

02:49.578 --> 02:52.445
Ladies, can I interest you
in a new kitchen?

02:52.513 --> 02:54.346
Okay, okay, here's what we're gonna do.

02:54.415 --> 02:56.905
Chase and Rachel, you're gonna
dance to exactly five songs.

02:56.967 --> 02:58.017
While they're doing that,

02:58.086 --> 02:59.285
Streeter and I are gonna pass out merch.

02:59.353 --> 03:00.753
Oh, wait till you see what it is.

03:00.822 --> 03:03.656
- Streety crushed it.
- I bet he didn't.

03:03.725 --> 03:06.292
Then, Chase is gonna take
pictures for 20 minutes.

03:06.360 --> 03:08.894
Anybody who posts one should
use the same hashtag.

03:08.963 --> 03:10.862
- Chom.
- What?

03:10.931 --> 03:14.467
Chom. It's a combo of Chase and Prom.

03:14.535 --> 03:17.002
Okay or since it's not prom,

03:17.071 --> 03:19.871
- why don't we do #DreamDance?
- Boo.

03:19.940 --> 03:22.141
And when is he doing
his live performance?

03:22.210 --> 03:24.577
Oh, uh yeah, we got some
bummer news on that front.

03:24.645 --> 03:27.179
C.D. has to be in the studio
early tomorrow morning

03:27.248 --> 03:29.115
so he is on strict vocal rest.

03:29.183 --> 03:31.150
No singing. Not talking. All night.

03:31.219 --> 03:32.684
Then why did he come to this?

03:32.753 --> 03:34.487
No, no, no. No, it's gonna be great.

03:34.555 --> 03:36.222
He's gonna lip-sync.
No one's gonna be able to tell.

03:36.290 --> 03:37.689
Streeter said he figured
the whole thing out.

03:37.758 --> 03:39.024
Yeah, I'll take care of the singing.

03:39.093 --> 03:41.226
- Excuse me?
- Ah! God, who's that?

03:41.294 --> 03:43.729
That's Chase's date.
You rode here with her?

03:43.797 --> 03:45.664
Can we go dance now?

03:45.733 --> 03:48.767
Hang on, hang on.
Just, uh... we talked about the...

03:48.836 --> 03:51.236
Then we went through, um...

03:51.304 --> 03:52.537
Yeah, I think we're good.
Yeah, you can go.

03:52.606 --> 03:53.905
Go have fun.

03:53.974 --> 03:56.441
Come on. Go, go, go. Have fun quickly.

03:56.510 --> 03:58.309
Run, bitch!

03:58.378 --> 04:00.278
Sorry. Sorry, sorry.

04:00.347 --> 04:01.680
She's new.

04:04.251 --> 04:06.618
What up, Madison High!

04:06.687 --> 04:10.355
Is everyone having fun tonight?

04:10.423 --> 04:12.923
Special shout-out to Rachel
and ChaseDreams.

04:12.992 --> 04:15.259
- You guys having fun?
- Whoo!

04:15.327 --> 04:17.762
You know it! Keep going, everybody.

04:17.829 --> 04:20.230
Hey, thanks for being
my date tonight, Car.

04:20.298 --> 04:21.866
Yes, of course. Yeah.

04:21.934 --> 04:23.300
You want to hear something sad?

04:23.369 --> 04:27.104
This is my tenth
high school dance with a girl.

04:27.173 --> 04:28.673
Aw.

04:28.741 --> 04:30.908
I mean, at least you got
to go to dances.

04:30.977 --> 04:32.476
- I was already in New York.
- Oh, yeah.

04:32.545 --> 04:34.111
They didn't have dances at that school?

04:34.180 --> 04:35.579
No, we studied dance.

04:35.648 --> 04:38.615
We didn't, like, do dances at night too.

04:38.685 --> 04:40.951
Mm. What would you do?

04:41.020 --> 04:42.920
Drugs, Cary.

04:42.989 --> 04:46.255
Ah, yeah.

04:46.324 --> 04:48.457
Hey, cool hair.

04:48.526 --> 04:50.426
- You sing?
- No, I play soccer.

04:50.495 --> 04:52.896
Perfect. Okay, athletes
make the best singers.

04:52.964 --> 04:54.597
Meet me in the library in 20 minutes,

04:54.666 --> 04:56.532
and, uh, bring your ball.

04:58.536 --> 05:01.337
- Hi, you're a music manager?
- Yes.

05:07.979 --> 05:10.346
So, what did you think?

05:10.415 --> 05:12.882
I think you can make
an excellent veterinarian.

05:13.685 --> 05:15.518
Okay, here's a fun thing.

05:15.587 --> 05:17.653
Which one of these kids were you at 14?

05:17.723 --> 05:19.355
Oh, my God. Ooh, ooh, ooh.

05:19.424 --> 05:21.590
Oh... No brainer.

05:21.658 --> 05:24.226
- That one. Fun, confident.
- Yeah.

05:24.294 --> 05:26.461
Dress fully tucked up into her asshole.

05:26.530 --> 05:28.330
She's living.

05:28.398 --> 05:29.698
- Well, there's me.
- Aw.

05:29.767 --> 05:31.800
- That is definitely me.
- Oh, yeah.

05:31.869 --> 05:33.635
Oh, n... never mind.

05:33.704 --> 05:35.704
And, damn!

05:35.773 --> 05:37.706
Hi, I'm Elijah.

05:37.775 --> 05:39.374
Are you CaryDreams?

05:39.443 --> 05:41.210
- Uh...
- Yes.

05:41.278 --> 05:42.477
- Yes.
- Yes, he is.

05:42.546 --> 05:44.146
Do you want to dance?

05:46.450 --> 05:48.016
Sure. Yeah. Yeah, buddy.

05:48.085 --> 05:50.418
Just promise you'll never hurt me.

05:50.487 --> 05:52.855
Oh, uh, I promise.

05:55.024 --> 05:56.524
Hi. We have a problem.

05:56.593 --> 05:58.159
Ugh, what did Streeter do?

05:58.228 --> 05:59.661
Nope, it's your brother.

05:59.730 --> 06:01.863
He's in the bathroom
with some boys smoking.

06:01.931 --> 06:03.565
He is?

06:03.634 --> 06:05.567
Oh, sh...

06:05.636 --> 06:07.034
Thank you.

06:09.000 --> 06:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:19.949 --> 06:23.385
You know I want to be
in the industry too.

06:23.453 --> 06:25.820
- Like, an actor?
- No.

06:25.889 --> 06:27.555
I want to run Hollywood.

06:27.624 --> 06:29.956
I'm gonna sit on the top floor
of a very tall building

06:30.025 --> 06:31.759
and be in charge of everyone.

06:31.827 --> 06:32.959
Oh.

06:33.028 --> 06:34.361
Cool.

06:41.236 --> 06:43.236
Excuse me, sir. You have a phone call.

06:43.306 --> 06:46.873
It's 9-1... 1, yeah. They called you.

06:46.942 --> 06:48.575
- It's an emergency.
- Oh.

06:48.644 --> 06:50.143
- Thank you.
- Uh-huh.

06:50.212 --> 06:51.378
Sorry, Elijah.

06:53.449 --> 06:55.916
Very good lie. So real.

06:55.984 --> 06:58.018
I know. Sorry, I panicked.

06:58.086 --> 07:01.054
Okay, I gotta go do rounds.

07:01.123 --> 07:02.455
Just walk around the school
and make sure

07:02.524 --> 07:03.923
kids aren't having sex.

07:03.991 --> 07:07.059
Do you... wanna come?

07:07.128 --> 07:09.128
Oh. Yeah.

07:09.197 --> 07:11.263
Cool. I'm Jeremy by the way.

07:11.333 --> 07:12.565
Hey, Cary.

07:15.704 --> 07:18.204
Oh, my God. Chase, what are you doing?

07:18.272 --> 07:19.739
This is...

07:19.808 --> 07:20.940
Lorraine?

07:21.008 --> 07:22.642
G'day mate.

07:22.711 --> 07:24.143
Australian.

07:24.499 --> 07:26.631
Why are you not in the car?

07:26.678 --> 07:27.757
I was just telling these boys

07:27.826 --> 07:29.129
about my favorite acting role.

07:29.178 --> 07:31.812
I was an extra on the pilot of "ER."

07:31.875 --> 07:33.420
If I think about that
for too long I could cry.

07:33.489 --> 07:36.723
I was also this close
to being an Olympic skater.

07:36.796 --> 07:39.093
But my mom wouldn't buy me skates.

07:39.161 --> 07:41.161
Lorraine. Car. Now.

07:42.398 --> 07:44.831
I can't believe
you're the drama teacher.

07:44.900 --> 07:48.969
Ours was so old.
I was like, thir..ty. Oh.

07:49.037 --> 07:50.437
Whoa.

07:50.506 --> 07:53.273
Yeah. Our teachers were not old.

07:53.342 --> 07:55.475
- Oh, God.
- Let me guess.

07:55.543 --> 07:57.910
You were the lead in all your plays too?

07:57.979 --> 07:59.678
You know it. Yep.

07:59.747 --> 08:02.248
No, our theater program
was actually really good, so.

08:02.317 --> 08:03.782
Okay, no offense,

08:03.851 --> 08:06.219
but literally every
high school play is bad.

08:06.287 --> 08:08.321
Even the good high school plays are bad.

08:08.389 --> 08:10.356
No, no, I mean we did
"Fiddler on the Roof"

08:10.425 --> 08:11.757
and I think if I saw it now

08:11.826 --> 08:14.560
I would still think it was good.

08:14.629 --> 08:16.129
Did you play Tevye?

08:16.197 --> 08:18.331
- Yeah.
- So you were a gay child

08:18.399 --> 08:21.634
playing a 40-year-old Russian peasant?

08:21.702 --> 08:24.670
Yes, but... but I think I pulled it off.

08:24.739 --> 08:26.205
- You didn't.
- Oh, my God.

08:26.274 --> 08:28.039
No high school kid ever has.

08:28.102 --> 08:30.169
No, you're right. I had braces.

08:30.237 --> 08:31.804
What?

08:31.872 --> 08:33.739
- Hey, break it up.
- It's teachers!

08:33.808 --> 08:36.408
- It's Mark and Diane!
- Oh, sorry, guys.

08:36.476 --> 08:38.110
They're trying to have a baby.

08:38.179 --> 08:39.477
Oh, that's sweet.

08:39.947 --> 08:42.514
Sorry, I just need to know
where you are at all times

08:42.582 --> 08:44.183
- for your safety.
- But Rachel wanted...

08:44.251 --> 08:46.852
Shh, no talking. Just... just dance.

08:46.921 --> 08:49.088
The swag has arrived.

08:49.156 --> 08:50.889
"The swag baby, yeah."

08:50.958 --> 08:52.457
Why are you doing Austin Powers?

08:52.526 --> 08:53.726
What do you mean?

08:53.794 --> 08:55.260
Okay, let's just pass these out.

08:55.329 --> 08:58.030
What'd you get, like T-shirts or...?

08:58.099 --> 08:59.531
Are these surge protectors?

08:59.600 --> 09:00.799
Okay, here's the thing.

09:00.868 --> 09:02.367
So last week I was ordering

09:02.436 --> 09:04.436
10 surge protectors for my house,

09:04.504 --> 09:07.004
and I accidentally typed in 1,000.

09:07.073 --> 09:08.773
Why did you need ten for your house?

09:08.842 --> 09:10.375
Well, you can never have
too many surge protectors.

09:10.444 --> 09:12.344
I guess you can?

09:13.347 --> 09:17.482
Whatever, just go.
Pass... pass them out.

09:17.551 --> 09:20.918
So, Rachel, is it a dream come
true to be dancing with Chase?

09:20.987 --> 09:22.887
- Yeah, he's a great dancer...
- Okay, that's great

09:22.956 --> 09:24.422
'cause you have 20 more seconds.

09:24.491 --> 09:26.258
Chase makes your electric.
Hold on to that.

09:26.326 --> 09:28.126
Stay plugged in, all right?

09:28.194 --> 09:30.094
Chase wants you to have this
for your electric.

09:30.163 --> 09:31.630
What is this crap?

09:31.698 --> 09:33.531
Oh, bad boy.

09:33.600 --> 09:35.233
Meet me in the library in ten minutes.

09:35.302 --> 09:36.868
And stay mad.

09:37.836 --> 09:40.137
So were you out in high school?

09:40.205 --> 09:42.105
Um, yeah.

09:42.174 --> 09:44.908
- Tenth grade. You?
- Hm.

09:44.977 --> 09:48.904
Uh, senior year of, um, college.

09:48.943 --> 09:51.615
- Oh, ew.
- I know, I know, I know.

09:51.662 --> 09:53.967
- College?
- Yeah, it's very late.

09:54.006 --> 09:55.952
- But, um...
- No, to each their own.

09:56.021 --> 09:58.155
No judgement.

09:58.223 --> 09:59.590
Wait.

09:59.659 --> 10:01.124
What play are you guys doing?

10:01.193 --> 10:03.026
I don't want to tell you.

10:03.095 --> 10:07.798
I mean, it looks like "Grease" on Mars?

10:07.866 --> 10:10.901
- That's literally what it is.
- Are you serious?

10:10.969 --> 10:13.136
Every couple years the kids
beg me to do "Grease."

10:13.205 --> 10:16.072
So I've done "Grease" in World War II.

10:16.141 --> 10:18.165
- "Grease" in a women's prison.
- Oh.

10:18.230 --> 10:20.797
And now "Grease" on Mars, baby!

10:20.861 --> 10:22.112
You've done a great job.

10:22.181 --> 10:24.681
- Hey, break it up!
- It's teachers.

10:24.749 --> 10:27.284
- It's Tom and Lisa.
- Oh. Sorry.

10:27.352 --> 10:28.785
Are they trying to have a baby, too?

10:28.854 --> 10:30.620
- No, that one's an affair.
- Oh.

10:30.689 --> 10:33.123
What up, what up? Big announcement!

10:33.192 --> 10:35.826
ChaseDreams is now taking
photos for the next 20.

10:35.894 --> 10:38.428
Oh, don't forget to use the #DreamDance.

10:38.496 --> 10:39.830
I thought it was chom.

10:39.898 --> 10:41.531
That's what my surge protector says.

10:41.599 --> 10:43.133
- It does?
- Yeah.

10:43.202 --> 10:45.302
In really bad handwriting.

10:45.370 --> 10:47.737
What is that man doing tonight?

10:47.806 --> 10:52.141
Okay, kids. You are now...

10:52.210 --> 10:54.744
a boy band. Huh? Ha-ha!

10:54.813 --> 10:57.313
You're the bad boy, you're the hot one,

10:57.382 --> 10:59.515
you're the pirate, you're the gay guy.

10:59.584 --> 11:01.050
- You gay?
- No.

11:01.118 --> 11:03.152
- Any of you guys gay?
- No.

11:03.221 --> 11:04.520
Okay, congrats. You're the gay one.

11:04.589 --> 11:06.856
And you're...

11:06.924 --> 11:08.123
the dud. All right.

11:08.192 --> 11:10.025
Welcome to the first day

11:10.094 --> 11:11.627
of the rest of your life.

11:11.696 --> 11:13.963
And I will be right there by your side.

11:14.031 --> 11:15.998
When you laugh,

11:16.067 --> 11:17.367
I'll laugh.

11:17.435 --> 11:19.369
When you cry,

11:19.437 --> 11:21.337
I'll cry.

11:21.405 --> 11:23.305
And when you dance,

11:23.374 --> 11:26.976
I'll watch you dance.
So what do you say?

11:27.044 --> 11:28.244
- Pass.
- No thanks.

11:28.312 --> 11:29.611
I just want to go dance.

11:29.680 --> 11:31.247
Do any of you have any younger brothers?

11:31.315 --> 11:32.948
Okay, I've been asked to announce

11:33.017 --> 11:35.084
we have another celebrity here
taking pics.

11:35.152 --> 11:37.586
Apparently she was in "ER."

11:37.654 --> 11:39.688
It also says she can drive stick?

11:39.757 --> 11:41.887
God damn it.

11:43.094 --> 11:45.027
It's so pretty out here.

11:45.096 --> 11:47.897
Makes me wanna go to a football game.

11:47.965 --> 11:51.967
Makes you want to sit
and watch a full football game?

11:52.036 --> 11:54.069
No, no. I guess it just makes me wanna

11:54.138 --> 11:56.070
watch "Friday Night Lights."

11:57.440 --> 11:59.840
So how long have you lived out here?

11:59.910 --> 12:02.944
Uh, pretty much right
after NYU I got this job.

12:03.013 --> 12:05.947
I just never wanted to do
the whole working actor thing

12:06.016 --> 12:08.649
and still be waiting tables at age 30.

12:10.086 --> 12:11.485
Totally, yeah.

12:12.822 --> 12:16.690
Oh, no. Do you wait tables?

12:16.759 --> 12:19.327
- Yeah, yeah.
- Ah, shit.

12:19.396 --> 12:21.762
I didn't literally mean waiting tables.

12:21.822 --> 12:25.199
- That's just the cliché thing you say.
- No. No, no, no. It's fine.

12:25.268 --> 12:28.636
I'm literally living
the cliché thing you say, so...

12:33.208 --> 12:36.143
And action.

12:36.211 --> 12:38.711
Why are you not in the car?

12:38.780 --> 12:40.747
This young man wants to be an actor too.

12:40.816 --> 12:43.683
Anyway, I'll never forget
what Geena Davis said to me

12:43.752 --> 12:45.152
on the set of "Stuart Little."

12:45.220 --> 12:48.388
"Either you go or I go."

12:48.457 --> 12:51.927
Lorraine. I will give you
$100 if you go sit in the car.

12:51.952 --> 12:53.293
Whoa. That's ten times more

12:53.362 --> 12:54.727
than what I got paid to come here.

12:54.796 --> 12:56.263
You did this for $10?

12:56.332 --> 12:59.071
Well, $5 after taxes. $4 after my agent.

12:59.133 --> 13:02.269
$3 after my manager. So $3. $3.

13:04.238 --> 13:05.838
You should go to law school.

13:06.607 --> 13:09.808
You know, I think I could
actually live here.

13:09.877 --> 13:13.145
Whoa. This is moving a little fast.

13:13.214 --> 13:16.648
Oh. No, I didn't mean, um,

13:16.717 --> 13:19.118
- here here, I just meant...
- Dude.

13:19.187 --> 13:21.487
Chill.

13:21.555 --> 13:23.222
Okay.

13:26.694 --> 13:28.227
Uh, it's teachers.

13:28.236 --> 13:30.547
- You bitches!
- Oh, no.

13:30.680 --> 13:32.844
How? How could you do this to me?

13:32.891 --> 13:35.242
Elijah, go back to the dance, please.

13:35.313 --> 13:36.712
Stay out of this, Jeremy.

13:36.780 --> 13:38.214
Haven't you done enough for one night?

13:38.282 --> 13:41.058
Again, you need to call me
"Mr. Delongpre."

13:41.113 --> 13:42.254
And you...

13:42.332 --> 13:44.399
I told you my dreams.

13:44.467 --> 13:47.768
We danced together.
Did that mean nothing to you?

13:47.837 --> 13:49.170
I don't know how to answer that.

13:49.239 --> 13:50.604
Typical.

13:50.673 --> 13:53.207
Good-bye, Cary Dubek.

13:53.276 --> 13:56.411
But just tell me one more thing
before I go.

13:56.479 --> 13:59.447
Was that really 911
on the phone for you?

14:00.850 --> 14:02.282
No.

14:02.351 --> 14:04.418
Wow.

14:05.955 --> 14:07.455
What up, what up?

14:07.523 --> 14:09.389
It's the moment we've
all been waiting for.

14:09.459 --> 14:12.426
He's got hundreds of millions
of views on YouTube

14:12.495 --> 14:14.995
and tonight he's performing live

14:15.064 --> 14:17.030
with a song that made him famous.

14:17.099 --> 14:21.969
Give it up for ChaseDreams!

14:25.407 --> 14:28.108
- Sorry again he's lip-syncing.
- That's okay.

14:28.177 --> 14:30.344
Did the DJ have the right track
for him to sing to?

14:30.412 --> 14:32.112
I'm assuming so. Streeter said

14:32.181 --> 14:33.814
he was taking care of the singing.

14:35.084 --> 14:36.850
Oh, no.

14:36.918 --> 14:40.220

You guys have been so great.
I'm so happy to be here.

15:30.571 --> 15:33.139
But I have to go.
I'm gonna meet Lil Wayne.

15:33.207 --> 15:35.274
Can you believe it? Lil Wayne!

15:35.343 --> 15:38.411
Okay, well, I am so lucky. Thank you.

15:39.380 --> 15:41.447
Goodnight.

15:46.386 --> 15:48.053
How do you think that went?

15:48.121 --> 15:50.155
You told me you were gonna
have him lip-sync.

15:50.223 --> 15:51.389
- We did.
- I thought you meant

15:51.458 --> 15:52.624
to like a track.

15:52.693 --> 15:54.359
But we promised a live performance.

15:54.428 --> 15:55.827
- What?
- Hey, Brooke,

15:55.896 --> 15:57.128
- we're leaving now?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:57.197 --> 15:58.564
You're done. You can go sit in the car.

15:58.632 --> 16:00.532
- And don't talk.
- But I wanna dance.

16:00.601 --> 16:03.068
- These kids are fun.
- Oh, I'm sorry, bud.

16:03.136 --> 16:04.970
But, you know, you'll have
plenty of dances to go to

16:05.039 --> 16:06.838
- when you get to high school.
- I'm not going to high school.

16:06.907 --> 16:08.574
I already graduated on Streeter's phone.

16:08.642 --> 16:10.576
- Yeah.
- Oh, no, that was...

16:10.644 --> 16:12.077
- That was just the eighth grade.
- No.

16:12.145 --> 16:13.545
He went through
the whole high school too.

16:13.614 --> 16:15.346
I mean, this guy tore through the app.

16:15.415 --> 16:17.748
He's a smart little dude. Ah!

16:17.817 --> 16:20.118
Hey, why don't you go say
good-bye to your date,

16:20.187 --> 16:22.120
and then we'll meet Lil Wayne!

16:22.189 --> 16:24.422
No. No.

16:24.491 --> 16:26.757
He's not going to that.
He's staying here.

16:26.826 --> 16:29.360
Oh. No can do, chica.

16:29.429 --> 16:31.262
I mean, I burned a lot
of bridges to get that invite.

16:31.331 --> 16:33.764
So it'd be poor form
if he didn't show up.

16:33.833 --> 16:36.134
Well, he's not gonna show,
so why don't you do your job

16:36.203 --> 16:40.004
for the first time tonight
and figure it the fuck out!

16:40.073 --> 16:42.240
Whoa. Who's that?

16:42.309 --> 16:45.110
That's my sister.

16:45.178 --> 16:47.378
Yeah, Dur. I meant the guy in all white

16:47.447 --> 16:49.114
- with the Kangol.
- Oh, that's nobody.

16:49.182 --> 16:51.181
Okay, boss, I, uh, hear you.

16:51.250 --> 16:53.517
I admit I had a few missteps tonight.

16:53.586 --> 16:55.219
But I think there's one thing
that we can agree

16:55.287 --> 16:57.787
that I did not mess up
and that's Lorraine.

16:57.856 --> 17:00.157
Her entrance was perfect,
and she's been sitting out

17:00.226 --> 17:01.791
in the car all night just like
we asked her too.

17:01.860 --> 17:04.027
So... here's what we're gonna do.

17:04.096 --> 17:05.929
We're gonna have Lorraine
come to the tequila party,

17:05.998 --> 17:07.431
put on sunglasses and a hoodie,

17:07.500 --> 17:09.599
and Lil Wayne will never
notice, and then Chase

17:09.667 --> 17:11.367
can have his night off.

17:11.436 --> 17:12.935
Streeter, that's...

17:13.005 --> 17:15.339
That's an amazing idea.

17:15.406 --> 17:17.073
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

17:17.143 --> 17:19.843
You really... you saved the night.

17:19.911 --> 17:21.310
Thank you.

17:21.380 --> 17:23.946
No. Thank you.

17:24.016 --> 17:27.383
And I promise I will...

17:27.452 --> 17:29.352
I will not mess up again.

17:29.420 --> 17:32.656
- Okay? Okay.
- Okay.

17:32.724 --> 17:35.191
Take the night off.

17:35.260 --> 17:37.627
Uh-oh! Somebody's hooking up tonight!

17:39.364 --> 17:40.664
You really think that's gonna work?

17:40.732 --> 17:43.199
No, she's a 50-something-year-old woman.

17:43.268 --> 17:46.903
But this will buy us a few hours.

17:48.974 --> 17:51.941
Whoo! Driver take us to Lil Wayne.

17:55.313 --> 17:57.547
God, it's uncanny.

18:06.757 --> 18:08.524
Not to be too whatever,

18:08.593 --> 18:11.026
but it was nice
that you were here tonight.

18:11.095 --> 18:13.062
There's never any gay guys
at these dances.

18:13.130 --> 18:14.697
All the teachers are straight.

18:14.765 --> 18:16.232
Oh, yeah, that sucks.

18:16.301 --> 18:18.334
Well, the science teacher's
gay but he's 82.

18:18.403 --> 18:21.170
- Oh. Yeah.
- And the sex was terrible.

18:43.721 --> 18:46.479
So, this is where kids go

18:46.526 --> 18:47.916
after dances?

18:47.964 --> 18:49.424
I think just the losers.

18:49.471 --> 18:51.171
Well, where do the cool kids go?

18:51.239 --> 18:53.774
I don't know. I was a diner kid.

18:53.842 --> 18:55.842
Aw, right.

18:55.930 --> 18:57.744
It's so peaceful out here.

18:57.813 --> 19:00.714
Yeah. Makes me want to kill myself.

19:00.783 --> 19:04.718
What? No, it's nice. It's sweet.

19:04.787 --> 19:06.619
I wish I had the kind
of brain that could be happy

19:06.689 --> 19:10.256
living here, but then
I wouldn't be able to read.

19:10.325 --> 19:13.993
Jeremy lives out here, and he
has a normal brain, I think.

19:15.096 --> 19:18.298
Maybe I should just quit
and move somewhere like this.

19:19.534 --> 19:22.202
My life in New York is not that great.

19:22.270 --> 19:24.937
I'm a waiter and I basically
live in a closet.

19:25.006 --> 19:27.917
Okay, well I literally live in a closet,

19:27.988 --> 19:30.343
so let's not be rude.

19:30.412 --> 19:33.546
Also, Cary, being a waiter is temporary.

19:33.615 --> 19:35.481
What if it's not?

19:35.550 --> 19:38.284
I'm 28 and I just

19:38.353 --> 19:41.187
shot a commercial where I smell a fart.

19:41.989 --> 19:44.223
I feel like if I was gonna be
a famous actor

19:44.291 --> 19:46.325
it would have happened by now.

19:46.393 --> 19:48.861
Maybe I just missed my wave.

19:49.831 --> 19:51.630
Oh.

19:51.699 --> 19:54.934
- You are so dumb.
- What?

19:55.002 --> 19:57.265
- Chase is your wave.
- Ew, no.

19:57.312 --> 19:59.004
He could be.

19:59.073 --> 20:02.007
Cary, I'm gonna say this with love.

20:02.076 --> 20:04.744
You are not above all of this.

20:04.812 --> 20:07.446
- I know I...
- I just... I feel like you had

20:07.514 --> 20:09.715
this romantic vision
of how this whole thing

20:09.784 --> 20:12.417
was gonna play out for you,
and sometimes it just

20:12.486 --> 20:14.153
doesn't happen that way.

20:14.222 --> 20:16.888
It happens in a million weird ways.

20:16.957 --> 20:21.226
Maybe Chase is your weird way.

20:25.932 --> 20:29.468
- Oh, my God.
- What?

20:29.536 --> 20:30.935
Lil Wayne just posted a picture

20:31.004 --> 20:32.704
with Streeter and Lorraine.

20:32.773 --> 20:34.806
No.

20:34.875 --> 20:36.708
"I love ChaseDreams.

20:36.777 --> 20:41.413
This Lil dude wrinkly as hell. #chom"

20:41.482 --> 20:43.348
- Oh, my God.
- Well...

20:43.417 --> 20:45.484
Is Streeter actually a genius?

20:45.552 --> 20:47.686
Hey, are you guys with ChaseDreams?

20:47.755 --> 20:48.987
- Yes.
- Yeah.

20:49.055 --> 20:51.355
♪ And your keys, oh ♪

20:51.424 --> 20:56.126
♪ Your ring of keys ♪

20:56.195 --> 20:57.817
That was beautiful.

20:57.892 --> 20:59.716
But we can't really do anything.

20:59.787 --> 21:02.673
- Okay, so Sandy is a human?
- Yeah.

21:03.123 --> 21:05.803
Yeah, and then Danny's what?
He's an alien?

21:05.873 --> 21:08.381
- Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh, okay, yeah.

21:08.428 --> 21:10.606
And then instead of Rydell High
they go to...

21:10.629 --> 21:12.082
- Mars High.
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

21:12.121 --> 21:14.496
Well, yeah, seems like you
really cracked it.

21:14.629 --> 21:16.978
I love doing intros. Hi!

21:19.646 --> 21:22.380
Hello, welcome to The Other Show.

21:22.405 --> 21:23.715
- I'm Chris.
- I'm Sarah.

21:23.740 --> 21:25.831
And we're the creators of The Other Two

21:25.856 --> 21:27.925
and we're here talking
about episode five

21:27.950 --> 21:29.914
with Ken, and Helene and Drew.

21:29.939 --> 21:32.986
Well, and this episode
was directed by...

21:33.011 --> 21:37.521
- Oh, Mike Karnell, my husband.
- Wow, her husband, wow.

21:37.546 --> 21:40.548
- At the time he was your fiancé.
- That's true.

21:40.573 --> 21:42.771
Yeah, we shot this episode
days before your wedding.

21:42.772 --> 21:45.980
Shot this episode, left on the next day

21:45.981 --> 21:48.022
to go down to where we got married.

21:48.023 --> 21:49.396
Got married that following Sunday.

21:49.397 --> 21:51.793
- Consummated the marriage.
- The following Saturday. Cconsummated it.

21:51.818 --> 21:54.744
And then we went on a scout
on Thursday the next week.

21:54.769 --> 21:56.980
It's so pretty out here.

21:56.981 --> 21:59.855
Makes me want to go to a football game.

21:59.856 --> 22:04.103
Makes you want to sit and
watch a full football game?

22:04.104 --> 22:05.938
No, no, I guess it just makes me

22:05.939 --> 22:07.479
want to watch "Friday Night Lights."

22:07.480 --> 22:09.781
I feel like a lot of
the show is you trying

22:09.806 --> 22:12.164
to measure yourself
against your little brother

22:12.189 --> 22:14.766
or other people or am
I doing well enough

22:14.791 --> 22:17.104
or am I doing well enough fast enough?

22:17.105 --> 22:19.922
Isn't that the question we all
ask ourselves all the time?

22:19.947 --> 22:22.258
Yeah, hopefully going
back to the high school

22:22.283 --> 22:24.732
helped bring that to a boil, sort of,

22:24.757 --> 22:26.772
I guess especially for
your character, for Cary.

22:26.797 --> 22:28.396
And even for Brooke
since she didn't get to

22:28.397 --> 22:29.355
go to high school really,

22:29.356 --> 22:30.563
she didn't have a typical upbringing.

22:30.564 --> 22:32.646
But I went to dance
school and did drugs.

22:32.647 --> 22:34.715
But in the writer's
room, we would say like,

22:34.740 --> 22:37.479
okay and this scene will be on
the football field at night.

22:37.480 --> 22:38.855
And the writer's room would be like

22:38.856 --> 22:39.971
"For why, what happens there?"

22:39.996 --> 22:41.103
And we'd be like, we
don't know but there's

22:41.104 --> 22:43.401
a big wide shot of a football field.

22:43.426 --> 22:45.103
I mean, we did Fiddler
on the Roof and I think

22:45.104 --> 22:48.896
if I saw it now I would...
I would still think it was good.

22:48.897 --> 22:50.197
Did you play Tevye?

22:50.222 --> 22:51.374
Yeah.

22:51.399 --> 22:53.150
So you were a gay child playing

22:53.175 --> 22:55.297
a 40 year old Russian peasant?

22:56.048 --> 22:58.625
Yes, but I think I pulled it off.

22:58.650 --> 23:00.187
In the writer's room we
were talking a lot about

23:00.188 --> 23:03.313
like roles that you,
at the time, were like...

23:03.314 --> 23:05.187
"This is crazy that I was cast as this,

23:05.188 --> 23:06.752
"but I was actually very good."

23:06.777 --> 23:07.959
'Cause, no, you weren't.

23:07.998 --> 23:11.563
I still think I was
pretty good in everything,

23:11.564 --> 23:12.796
so that never happened to me.

23:12.821 --> 23:14.469
Well, you've done Broadway,
so you probably were good.

23:14.494 --> 23:18.686
I played... in ninth grade,
I played Daddy Warbucks...

23:18.711 --> 23:20.460
In ninth grade?

23:20.485 --> 23:23.063
In ninth grade I didn't
want to shave my head

23:23.064 --> 23:24.926
and so I was like
"I'll wear a bald cap",

23:24.951 --> 23:27.660
we glued it on so I
didn't, like you could feel

23:27.685 --> 23:30.103
the pressure, you could feel,
you didn't want to rip it.

23:30.104 --> 23:32.700
So I would... I did the whole play

23:32.725 --> 23:34.813
like I had a neck brace on.

23:34.814 --> 23:37.568
In the moment that year,
were you like...

23:37.593 --> 23:39.813
"I'm getting away with
this, this bald cap works."

23:39.814 --> 23:41.186
Or did you know this was pretty rough?

23:41.211 --> 23:42.958
I was terrific.

23:42.983 --> 23:44.563
Yeah, you were terrific,
you were terrific.

23:44.564 --> 23:45.855
At least I thought I was.

23:45.856 --> 23:47.313
I don't want to stop our conversation,

23:47.314 --> 23:48.843
but we do have a superstar in our midst.

23:48.868 --> 23:49.938
Because you won a very

23:49.963 --> 23:51.274
- important award in high school.
- Thank you, yep.

23:51.299 --> 23:53.407
- So just let's throw focus to her.
- What was the award?

23:53.432 --> 23:56.117
Well, in high school, in 1999,

23:56.142 --> 23:59.156
I won best actress in New Jersey.

23:59.181 --> 24:00.360
- Wow.
- Wow.

24:00.385 --> 24:02.287
- What Sarah?
- At a theater festival.

24:02.312 --> 24:04.688
Best actor in New Jersey
was also in our play,

24:04.689 --> 24:05.967
and so was the best supporting actress

24:05.992 --> 24:08.153
because our drama
teachers ran the festival.

24:08.178 --> 24:09.990
Okay, well this was
not told to me backstage.

24:10.015 --> 24:12.646
So I do think it was real,
I do think it was real.

24:12.647 --> 24:14.326
Edit out my set-up.

24:14.351 --> 24:16.927
This is not what was told to me.

24:16.952 --> 24:18.560
Cool hair, do you sing?

24:18.585 --> 24:19.871
No, I play soccer.

24:19.896 --> 24:22.342
Perfect, okay, athletes
make the best singers.

24:22.367 --> 24:24.358
Meet me in the library in 20 minutes,

24:24.383 --> 24:26.045
and bring your ball.

24:26.070 --> 24:27.980
I was telling you this story, which is,

24:27.981 --> 24:30.980
it was a very pivotal
moment in my deciding

24:30.981 --> 24:33.605
to dive deeper into being an actor.

24:33.606 --> 24:37.516
I played sports and
I was in plays in school,

24:37.541 --> 24:38.856
and I would do both.

24:38.857 --> 24:41.664
The varsity coach cornered
me in the locker room

24:41.728 --> 24:44.390
and he was like "Marino,"
and I was like "Yeah?".

24:44.415 --> 24:46.883
And he goes "You gonna
play basketball this year

24:46.908 --> 24:48.962
- "or do that fag acting?"
- Oh.

24:48.987 --> 24:50.772
And I was like...

24:51.001 --> 24:55.067
"I'm gonna do the acting"
and then that was it.

24:56.092 --> 24:59.090
I didn't play basketball
that next year, and I just...

24:59.115 --> 25:00.190
It was like...

25:00.215 --> 25:03.426
And I still remember that and that was,
you know, many, many years ago.

25:03.451 --> 25:05.285
- Yeah.
- But I remember that moment

25:05.310 --> 25:08.823
and the decision of being like...
We were talking about it.

25:08.848 --> 25:10.205
- Yeah, it's a thing about, yeah...
- It's a thing that drove...

25:10.230 --> 25:11.543
that, you have these moments

25:11.568 --> 25:13.104
- of people who inspire you...
- Yeah.

25:13.105 --> 25:15.563
Or people who say things
that like, infuriate you

25:15.564 --> 25:17.876
and motivate you to dig deeper into it.

25:17.901 --> 25:20.063
But that's cool that
that made you be like,

25:20.088 --> 25:21.147
- that didn't make you be like,
- I'm going acting.

25:21.172 --> 25:23.408
"Oh, I don't want to seem like
a fag, I'll do basketball.

25:23.433 --> 25:25.772
- You were like fuck him, I'm gonna...
- Exactly.

25:25.797 --> 25:27.658
I guess it's probably
cause you weren't gay.

25:27.683 --> 25:29.980
I was gay, so I'd be like
"No, I 'm playing basketball."

25:29.981 --> 25:32.200
I love basketball.

25:34.240 --> 25:35.572
- Fucking fag...
- I'm quiting.

25:36.647 --> 25:40.818
So, this is where kids go after dances?

25:40.843 --> 25:42.232
I think just the losers.

25:42.257 --> 25:44.103
Well, where do the cool kids go?

25:44.104 --> 25:46.730
I don't know, I was a diner kid.

25:46.731 --> 25:49.022
You guys have fun high
school dance stories?

25:49.023 --> 25:51.399
I only went to dances with gay men.

25:53.571 --> 25:55.007
Yeah, that sounds about right.

25:55.032 --> 25:57.484
So, yep, I went to
theater school, so did you.

25:57.509 --> 25:59.734
Went to dances with gay
men and I'm thriving.

25:59.759 --> 26:01.730
Right around the time
that we were going to prom,

26:01.731 --> 26:03.103
I had a high school boyfriend

26:03.104 --> 26:05.171
and we were very serious
about each other.

26:05.196 --> 26:08.009
And we both were like in musicals
and plays and whatever together.

26:08.034 --> 26:10.980
And we each wrote a song
for each other and

26:10.981 --> 26:12.454
then we snuck into a church and

26:12.479 --> 26:14.189
played them for each other and sobbed.

26:15.541 --> 26:16.555
That is...

26:16.588 --> 26:18.502
- That is adorable!
- Is he gay now?

26:18.527 --> 26:19.643
- No.
- Amazing.

26:19.668 --> 26:21.613
By the way, it sounds
like it's from "Dawson's Creek."

26:21.638 --> 26:24.385
I didn't kiss a boy
throughout all of high school

26:24.410 --> 26:26.803
cause I was in the closet obviously

26:26.828 --> 26:30.022
and then my first kiss
with a boy, I came out to

26:30.023 --> 26:32.438
one of my friends from high school
in my freshman year of college.

26:32.439 --> 26:35.234
I AOL instant messaged him
and I was like "I'm gay"

26:35.259 --> 26:37.104
and then he was like "Me too."

26:37.105 --> 26:39.499
And then so the next time
I was in my hometown,

26:39.524 --> 26:41.139
we met up, we were like, well...

26:41.164 --> 26:42.479
I don't think we're gonna be
together but should

26:42.480 --> 26:44.103
we kiss each other since
we've never kissed?

26:44.104 --> 26:46.849
So I made us drive to a half-built home.

26:46.874 --> 26:48.993
- What?
- It was half-built, I drove us there.

26:49.018 --> 26:51.061
And then I kind of location scouted,

26:51.086 --> 26:52.444
I was like, I think
this room's big enough,

26:52.469 --> 26:54.641
I can sit down onto a step.

26:54.666 --> 26:56.771
And we made out there and it was great.

26:56.772 --> 26:58.805
You produced your first kiss?

26:58.830 --> 27:00.104
Yeah, I did.

27:00.129 --> 27:01.420
I guess as an outro, I'll just say...

27:01.445 --> 27:03.104
Hi, Eric. That was a great night.

27:03.129 --> 27:05.898
And watch our next episode.
