LlCALSl: Lieutenant?
FANCY: Come on in, Janice.

00:28.384 --> 00:32.797
- You're being promoted.
- Oh, yeah? I'm getting my gold shield?

00:32.972 --> 00:36.804
- Congratulations.
- Thanks. This is for real?

00:36.976 --> 00:39.265
You're assigned to lntelligence.

00:39.436 --> 00:42.805
You won't be transferred
for three to four weeks.

00:42.981 --> 00:47.109
Any idea how this happened?
I've been in Anticrime three months.

00:47.277 --> 00:52.402
This was a contract from the Organized
Crime Unit, from lnspector Lastarza.

00:52.574 --> 00:55.740
You were effective in an
undercover assignment.

00:55.911 --> 00:58.745
You want to tell me
anything about that?

00:59.581 --> 01:02.202
I reported a corrupt solicitation.

01:02.375 --> 01:04.997
lnspector Lastarza
had me work for him.

01:05.170 --> 01:08.336
Did you know he's going
to work for the DEA?

01:08.506 --> 01:10.582
I heard rumors about that.

01:10.758 --> 01:15.088
I guess he wanted to make sure
your work was acknowledged.

01:15.262 --> 01:18.180
Personnel's idea was
that you work here...

01:18.391 --> 01:20.847
...while lntelligence reorganizes.

01:21.018 --> 01:22.761
Yeah. Sure.

01:22.979 --> 01:28.103
All cards on the table, you had a
personal relationship with John Kelly?

01:28.275 --> 01:31.026
Yes. That's been over for a while now.

01:31.195 --> 01:34.029
- No problem working with him?
- Not for me.

01:34.196 --> 01:38.610
- You might want to ask Detective Kelly.
- I will.

01:38.785 --> 01:40.577
Okay.

01:42.163 --> 01:45.449
Thanks. Talk about coming
from left field, huh?

01:45.624 --> 01:47.249
Yeah.

01:49.337 --> 01:52.670
MAN: Detective John Kelly--
DONNA: Can I help you?

01:52.840 --> 01:56.209
- Just Detective John Kelly.
- Is he expecting you?

01:56.386 --> 01:59.469
No, he's not.
He's a close, personal friend.

01:59.638 --> 02:04.882
I've got to talk to you on a personal
matter. The feces has hit the fan.

02:05.060 --> 02:08.725
Let's not voice- mail it though,
Charlie, okay?

02:08.896 --> 02:15.516
Some malevolent asshole
has sent these pictures to my wife.

02:15.696 --> 02:18.400
To Kitty, John.
Can you believe that?

02:18.574 --> 02:21.065
Who do you think might have done it?

02:21.243 --> 02:25.405
I have no grievances with anyone.
I stayed up and thought...

02:25.623 --> 02:29.239
...there might be someone
with grievances against me.

02:29.417 --> 02:34.292
These people I may have inadvertently
offended in business transactions.

02:34.463 --> 02:39.041
- Kited checks and things.
- Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

02:39.218 --> 02:41.424
Go ahead, sit down.

02:42.888 --> 02:46.673
- They sent these pictures to Kitty?
- Apartment on Fifth.

02:46.850 --> 02:48.226
What'd she say?

02:48.394 --> 02:53.019
She said,"How can you do this to us?"
Then she went to Mustique.

02:53.189 --> 02:57.981
She would not go there unless she
was grief- stricken and distraught.

02:58.153 --> 02:59.812
Say she was coming back?

02:59.988 --> 03:05.362
She'll learn to deal with this. We've
got to find the prick that did this.

03:05.535 --> 03:09.200
Who gets hurt here, John?
Not me. Kitty and Minette...

03:09.413 --> 03:14.324
...two of the most extraordinary
women to ever grace this planet.

03:14.503 --> 03:18.795
I can't help you officially, but
let's think. The people on this list--

03:18.964 --> 03:21.170
They're friends, that's what hurts.

03:21.341 --> 03:25.291
Let me tell you what I'm thinking.
They have no motive...

03:25.471 --> 03:29.303
...because if they break you up
they don't get any money.

03:29.475 --> 03:32.226
Has there been another
extortion attempt?

03:32.394 --> 03:37.636
John, I am trying to protect my ass
and my marriage.

03:37.858 --> 03:41.308
I am being totally honest with you.

03:41.486 --> 03:45.983
Which is why I don't think
it's anybody on the list.

03:46.157 --> 03:49.443
- Which leaves Minette, right?
- Minette?

03:54.207 --> 03:59.581
She ever ask you to leave your wife?
She talk about you guys splitting up?

03:59.754 --> 04:01.034
Minette?

04:01.839 --> 04:05.088
That bitch maneuvered
me into these photographs.

04:05.301 --> 04:08.753
She probably paid the
photographer with my money.

04:08.929 --> 04:12.298
I open up my heart
and allow her to make a home...

04:12.516 --> 04:15.090
...and she defecates in my broadloom.

04:15.269 --> 04:19.135
Well, the scales have fallen
from these eyes of mine.

04:19.355 --> 04:25.607
I am gonna put a 1 0- ton weight on that
worthless bag of gumbo, if I find her.

04:25.779 --> 04:29.029
- You're talking like an asshole.
- Listen to me!

04:29.199 --> 04:33.030
If I wasn't really rich,
I'd be an asshole.

05:33.718 --> 05:35.510
Good Time Charlie

05:54.822 --> 05:57.064
COSTAS: Taxi!
SlPOWlCZ: Sylvia.

05:57.367 --> 05:59.574
COSTAS:
Oh. Wait, wait!

06:00.287 --> 06:02.410
- What's going on?
- Nothing much.

06:02.580 --> 06:05.534
- I picked your dad a present.
- From Yanni's.

06:05.708 --> 06:10.168
It's a Greek shop. If he doesn't
like it, he can exchange it.

06:10.337 --> 06:12.460
I'm sure he will love it.

06:12.632 --> 06:16.795
- I got the receipt, so....
- That was very thoughtful of you.

06:16.968 --> 06:21.049
I gotta be in court tomorrow.
I thought I'd meet you here...

06:21.224 --> 06:23.263
- ...and we'd go over about 6.
- Okay.

06:23.433 --> 06:26.802
If you still have work,
meet me at the restaurant.

06:26.978 --> 06:31.687
I don't feature going in on my own.
First time meeting your family.

06:31.858 --> 06:37.529
Would you stop worrying? These are the
least formal people you will ever meet.

06:37.697 --> 06:42.773
Look, I've been thinking.
I'm not gonna dance.

06:42.952 --> 06:46.452
- Whatever you want.
- That gonna make everybody mad?

06:46.748 --> 06:51.990
Andy, this is a birthday party.
People are going to have fun.

06:52.169 --> 06:56.297
Now, whatever you want to do
will be fine.

06:56.966 --> 07:00.916
All right. I'll meet you here at 6.

07:01.929 --> 07:04.799
I'll break plates,
but I'm not gonna dance.

07:05.307 --> 07:07.346
Okay.

07:15.775 --> 07:17.483
- Hey, detective.
- Morning.

07:17.652 --> 07:19.526
- Can I talk to you?
- Sure.

07:19.695 --> 07:22.780
- I'm being promoted.
- Is that right?

07:22.948 --> 07:28.191
Lastarza's going to DEA. Guess he
wanted to take out an insurance policy.

07:28.579 --> 07:29.954
Good luck with that.

07:30.122 --> 07:34.202
I'm assigned to lntelligence,
but I'll be in the squad a month...

07:34.418 --> 07:37.419
...unless you object.
Fancy's gonna talk to you.

07:37.588 --> 07:39.046
How do you feel?

07:39.214 --> 07:43.543
I feel okay if you feel okay.
I don't have any problems with it.

07:43.719 --> 07:46.969
Well, I'll talk to him.
And congratulations.

07:47.138 --> 07:48.798
Thanks.

07:53.269 --> 07:57.018
- Hey, it's Mrs. Fancy. How you doing?
- Great, thanks.

07:57.190 --> 07:59.313
Lieutenant, your wife's here.

07:59.483 --> 08:02.852
- The girls are fine, Art.
- So, what's going on?

08:03.029 --> 08:05.520
I want to buy you an early lunch.

08:05.699 --> 08:09.565
- Let me make a few phone calls.
- Okay.

08:11.703 --> 08:14.907
Got it. No, what was
that first name again?

08:15.083 --> 08:19.827
Minette? 21 4 James Street. Got it.

08:20.754 --> 08:25.499
- That's Minette Coleman?
- Yeah, shooting homicide. White female.

08:25.675 --> 08:29.970
- That's Charlie Lear's mistress.
- Your friend that stole that train?

08:30.138 --> 08:32.890
- He was all pissed off at her.
- For what?

08:33.057 --> 08:36.889
- Somebody sent his wife pictures.
- Him and this Minette?

08:37.062 --> 08:38.804
That Minette.

08:41.357 --> 08:45.356
It's hard to figure he'd talk to you,
then whack this girl.

08:45.528 --> 08:48.861
- I know.
- Course, he did steal the F train.

08:50.741 --> 08:55.035
I saw a man leave her apartment
about two and a half hours ago.

08:55.204 --> 08:57.031
Can you describe him?

08:57.206 --> 09:01.039
I mostly saw him from the back.
He's 5' 1 0", brown hair.

09:01.252 --> 09:03.540
He had a camel's- hair coat on.

09:03.712 --> 09:06.334
He looked like a guy I'd seen before.

09:06.507 --> 09:11.169
When he was leaving, he was creating
a ruckus, muttering profanities.

09:11.344 --> 09:14.049
- You talk to him?
- No, no.

09:14.222 --> 09:18.469
In the next hour, I thought about
how I'd heard a car backfire...

09:18.644 --> 09:22.143
...a few minutes before
he left Minette's apartment.

09:22.314 --> 09:26.524
I thought I should check on Minette
and make sure she's okay.

09:26.693 --> 09:31.900
When she didn't answer, I felt I had
to call you guys, because she was home.

09:32.073 --> 09:35.488
- What do you do?
- I'm a night RN at St. Vincent's.

09:35.825 --> 09:40.452
- If you saw him, could you lD him?
- I don't know. I'd give it a whirl.

09:40.623 --> 09:43.493
- Thanks for your help.
- You have my numbers.

09:43.668 --> 09:45.494
Yeah, thanks.

09:48.798 --> 09:51.632
M. E. says she was
shot through the pillow.

09:51.799 --> 09:54.172
This guy described Charlie Lear.

09:54.427 --> 09:56.835
This just came in over the radio.

09:57.014 --> 10:02.055
Sanitation worker found a gun
in a dumpster three blocks over.

10:02.227 --> 10:04.054
Tell them we're on our way.

10:04.229 --> 10:07.847
Would your pal be bright enough
to toss his iron?

10:08.024 --> 10:10.860
If he had a gun,
wouldn't he be the type...

10:11.027 --> 10:15.439
...to shop at Barneys with
the butt sticking out of his waistband?

10:15.782 --> 10:18.569
You want to tell me what's going on?

10:18.742 --> 10:21.363
I'm pregnant, Art.

10:22.538 --> 10:27.033
- How did that happen?
- We both know how that happens.

10:27.209 --> 10:32.037
- The birth control failed?
- Yes, it failed.

10:33.173 --> 10:37.800
Dr. Sloan said a small percentage
of times something goes wrong.

10:37.969 --> 10:42.133
- I can't believe what I'm hearing.
- I thought you'd be happy.

10:42.306 --> 10:46.470
The doctor said you weren't
supposed to be pregnant again.

10:46.644 --> 10:48.851
He thinks it'll be all right.

10:49.063 --> 10:52.765
There's only a very small chance
there will be problems.

10:52.942 --> 10:55.065
A small chance.

10:56.029 --> 11:00.157
Arthur, everything doesn't
always go according to plan.

11:00.366 --> 11:02.773
Not everything goes by the book.

11:02.951 --> 11:06.616
- Did you do this on purpose?
- How can you ask me that?

11:06.789 --> 11:09.873
- So that's a no?
- That's a no.

11:10.041 --> 11:14.253
But if you're asking,
do I regret having a life inside me?

11:14.422 --> 11:16.793
The answer to that is no also.

11:17.840 --> 11:19.169
Can't you be happy?

11:19.342 --> 11:24.170
- That your life might be at risk?
- That we're gonna have another child.

11:32.480 --> 11:35.516
No, I'm not going in there with you.

11:36.484 --> 11:40.944
- Let's sit down and talk about this.
- No, Art, I'm going home.

11:41.113 --> 11:44.613
I don't want to sit with you
or have a meal with you.

11:44.784 --> 11:48.033
I don't want to look at you.
You break my heart.

12:01.257 --> 12:06.133
That gun we got from the dumpster
was registered to this Charlie.

12:06.304 --> 12:09.008
- Your friend?
- I put him in a lineup.

12:09.223 --> 12:12.390
- I couldn't get an lD.
- He's in interview?

12:12.560 --> 12:15.645
- Want me off this?
- Could knowing him help us?

12:15.813 --> 12:19.728
I think so. He's a flake,
but I can make sense out of him.

12:19.901 --> 12:23.981
- It's Sipowicz's case. Work it with him.
- Okay.

12:24.155 --> 12:25.352
- John.
- Yeah?

12:25.530 --> 12:29.030
- Janice Licalsi's getting her shield.
- She told me.

12:29.201 --> 12:32.071
Would you mind her working
in the squad?

12:32.246 --> 12:34.037
I don't foresee a problem.

12:34.206 --> 12:37.788
- Your personal relationship is settled?
- That's over.

12:37.960 --> 12:40.036
- Okay?
- Okay.

12:40.920 --> 12:45.250
That pistol we pulled out of the
dumpster is registered to you.

12:45.425 --> 12:47.915
The last time I saw that pistol...

12:48.136 --> 12:51.635
...was three months ago
in my underwear drawer.

12:51.807 --> 12:55.589
I wasn't lD'd, was I,
by these people in this lineup?

12:55.768 --> 12:59.350
- Where were you the last few hours?
- I wasn't lD'd.

12:59.522 --> 13:02.392
If I was,
I'll check into the puzzle house.

13:02.566 --> 13:06.351
- Where were you?
- I can tell you if I have to.

13:06.528 --> 13:12.114
This qualifies as a jam, Charlie.
I'd recommend that you tell us.

13:12.284 --> 13:16.578
I was at my other girlfriend's.
Claudia Lowe, she's a good kid.

13:16.746 --> 13:19.582
Claudia's trapped
in a loveless marriage.

13:19.750 --> 13:23.498
I'd appreciate it if you
would approach her discreetly.

13:23.670 --> 13:26.457
Does Claudia live with her husband?

13:26.632 --> 13:28.873
She does. He's not in town a lot.

13:29.051 --> 13:33.677
Sells sectional garage doors.
He's in Troy today. He may be back.

13:33.846 --> 13:37.678
- You got an address?
- Yeah. Yeah.

13:37.850 --> 13:42.180
She lives in Chelsea on 21 st Street.

13:42.897 --> 13:49.148
This is the phone number. You call it,
and then hang up. Then call it again.

13:49.319 --> 13:51.644
If someone answers and hangs up...

13:51.823 --> 13:55.570
...that's Claudia indicating
it is safe to come over.

13:55.743 --> 13:57.866
Sit down.

13:58.036 --> 14:03.196
I gotta go pick up Mike Trevor. He's
an alky. I pick him up every week.

14:03.459 --> 14:07.041
You take him to a meeting
or something pious like that?

14:07.212 --> 14:11.162
No. I take him to the Harvard Club
to get loaded.

14:12.008 --> 14:13.799
Are you a risk of flight?

14:14.135 --> 14:18.216
Look, you guys, I came in here.
I come under my own hook.

14:18.431 --> 14:22.595
I give up Claudia's name,
she's gonna say I'm not guilty.

14:22.769 --> 14:25.769
Now, I am very torn up
about this thing...

14:25.938 --> 14:28.689
...and I would like
to medicate my grief.

14:28.857 --> 14:32.143
You better make yourself
available to us.

14:32.319 --> 14:34.359
On my honor.

14:58.636 --> 15:00.047
Oops.

15:00.221 --> 15:02.344
I was expecting someone else.

15:02.515 --> 15:07.390
Yeah, I can see that. New York City
police detectives. Can we come in?

15:09.104 --> 15:11.939
CLAUDIA: What's this about?
I'm expecting someone.

15:12.107 --> 15:13.483
Charlie Lear?

15:13.651 --> 15:17.316
What's this have to do with Charlie?
Is he in trouble?

15:17.487 --> 15:21.781
Mrs. Lowe, what were you doing
between 9 and 1 1 this morning?

15:22.492 --> 15:25.114
- Watching TV, sleeping.
- Alone?

15:26.622 --> 15:29.408
This is about Charlie, isn't it?
Right.

15:29.624 --> 15:32.790
He gave you the number.
You used the signal.

15:32.961 --> 15:36.793
- Between 9 and 1 1?
- If Charlie says he was here, he was.

15:36.965 --> 15:40.914
No, that's not the way it works.
Do you say he was here?

- Sure, he was here.
- What time?

15:43.513 --> 15:48.507
I'm not positive. I was asleep.
I never looked at the clock.

15:48.685 --> 15:50.807
So he didn't use the phone.

15:50.978 --> 15:54.596
He might have.
I might have gone back to sleep.

15:54.773 --> 15:58.687
- What time did he leave?
- I'm not positive. I get up late.

15:58.860 --> 16:01.529

to know about this, does he?

in court Charlie was here?

- Yeah.

Shut the hell up. Shut up.
Come on, shut up.

33:41.339 --> 33:44.506
You want a refreshment of some kind?

33:44.675 --> 33:48.720
A little rub of the brush?

33:49.096 --> 33:51.717
I don't understand. What happened?

33:51.890 --> 33:55.058
No? What part don't you understand?

33:55.227 --> 34:00.054
I thought you had just one sip
for the toast, and that you were okay.

34:00.232 --> 34:06.104
I don't take a little Greek toast like
some kind of fag. I drink, I drink.

34:06.280 --> 34:08.235
So you bought a bottle?

34:08.406 --> 34:14.409
- What is this? A kind of interrogation?
- No, I just want to know what happened.

34:14.996 --> 34:18.199
I had a couple of drinks
is what happened.

34:18.373 --> 34:19.952
You were doing great.

34:20.125 --> 34:25.581
Look, I had the one drink, and
that was okay, so I had a second one.

34:25.755 --> 34:32.422
And I watched some TV, and the TV
pissed me off, so I took care of that.

34:32.597 --> 34:36.547
I did a repair job.
That was around the fourth drink.

- No.

- We got along okay.

37:02.948 --> 37:05.985
We appreciate you talking to us again.

37:06.910 --> 37:10.031
I will unofficially say
Charlie was with me...

37:10.206 --> 37:14.369
...but I will not confirm it.
I was hoping you'd understand that.

37:14.543 --> 37:20.996
How come you say Charlie was with you
when this other girl got murdered...

37:21.174 --> 37:25.124
- ...so we think you're lying?
- I was unclear on the time.

37:25.303 --> 37:31.057
Or you're sure he was with you, but got
a reason to make us think differently.

37:31.227 --> 37:35.058
- I don't understand.
- I wouldn't figure the reason is you...

37:35.229 --> 37:41.482
...because, you don't seem smart. Say
somebody paid you to have the reason.

37:41.653 --> 37:46.361
You got money problems, maybe your
old man's not selling garage doors...

37:46.532 --> 37:50.316
...so someone offers you money
to jam up Charlie Lear.

37:50.494 --> 37:54.243

- See, here is a case...

If this wasn't your idea...

37:58.460 --> 38:01.912

to tell your story.

Charlie here and keep him here.

back away from the story.
