WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:09.920
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:21.720 --> 00:23.440
I can't. Sorry.

01:35.120 --> 01:37.840
You're already up.
How are you? Feeling better?

01:38.440 --> 01:39.440
You look better.

01:40.160 --> 01:41.000
Yeah.

01:41.560 --> 01:43.400
Thank you. Thanks for asking.

01:45.720 --> 01:47.280
What a hard time.

01:48.320 --> 01:49.160
Yeah.

01:50.120 --> 01:53.720
Everyone thinks working at a vacation spot
is like being on vacation.

01:53.800 --> 01:55.760
But we have a lot of responsibilities.

01:56.640 --> 01:57.480
Of course.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.080
And don't add getting you up
to my list. Get up, sleepyhead.

02:01.160 --> 02:03.600
-No.
-Get up. Come on.

02:07.920 --> 02:09.480
<i>I didn't want to touch you</i>

02:09.560 --> 02:11.040
<i>You're special</i>

02:11.120 --> 02:14.080
<i>The song, with you, baby</i>
<i>For better or for worse</i>

02:14.160 --> 02:15.920
<i>I know how well you said</i>

02:16.000 --> 02:17.800
<i>We're just a game</i>

02:17.880 --> 02:20.920
<i>I was hoping you'd change the rules later</i>

02:21.000 --> 02:24.360
<i>You're with that other guy</i>
<i>He doesn't love you very much</i>

02:24.440 --> 02:27.360
<i>Sometimes I think he's going crazy</i>

02:27.440 --> 02:28.640
<i>I'm not wrong</i>

02:28.720 --> 02:30.440
<i>If you had considered me</i>

02:30.520 --> 02:33.840
<i>Something good could've happened</i>

02:33.920 --> 02:36.920
<i>And now I'm telling you it hurts</i>

02:37.000 --> 02:40.440
<i>How painful you're going with him</i>

02:40.520 --> 02:43.080
<i>How painful you're not seeing me</i>

02:43.680 --> 02:46.240
<i>How painful I didn't meet up with you</i>

02:48.640 --> 02:50.680
How painful that we're leaving

02:50.760 --> 02:54.360
because this was the Monzo Twins
exclusively for Ian Tech.

02:54.440 --> 02:55.800
Until next time, Techios.

02:55.880 --> 03:00.000
Don't forget to give me a like
and share for more Ian Tech.

03:03.120 --> 03:06.720
-You were great, man. Really.
-Now you hold up your end of our deal.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.040
Hold this.

03:13.680 --> 03:14.720
What are you doing?

03:20.640 --> 03:22.800
"Chocolate with almonds and raisins.<i>"</i>

03:22.880 --> 03:25.200
"Dark chocolate and blueberry truffles."

03:26.120 --> 03:27.680
"White chocolate bars<i>.</i>"

03:28.360 --> 03:31.080
"Chocolate truffles
with dulce de leche. 301."

03:31.160 --> 03:34.320
-What's this, man?
-Those are Steffi's favorite chocolates.

03:34.400 --> 03:36.440
And 301 is her room number.

03:37.160 --> 03:39.920
You should also leave
a note saying something like,

03:40.400 --> 03:43.040
"This is to sweeten your heart."
Something like that.

03:43.120 --> 03:46.800
Improvise. If you follow the steps,
you'll score several points.

03:46.880 --> 03:47.880
Great, man.

03:48.400 --> 03:51.560
If this works,
we can do another collab for Ian Tech.

03:51.640 --> 03:55.240
I'll put the video up today.
When you can, bring the drone to my room.

03:55.320 --> 03:57.000
-Yeah.
-You're great, boys.

03:57.080 --> 03:57.920
Let's see.

03:58.680 --> 03:59.560
He's awesome.

04:00.320 --> 04:03.000
There you are. I have bad news.

04:03.080 --> 04:06.600
The hotel staff
isn't respecting our contract,

04:06.680 --> 04:11.080
so we have until lunch to pack our bags.
We're leaving this afternoon.

04:15.600 --> 04:18.520
Sorry. I'm looking for Tony.
He said he was coming here.

04:18.600 --> 04:20.200
Weird. He hasn't been here.

04:21.440 --> 04:22.720
Is everything okay?

04:22.800 --> 04:25.080
-Problems with Matrix.
-Did something happen?

04:25.160 --> 04:27.280
She tore up the contract. They're leaving.

04:28.280 --> 04:30.000
What? I don't understand.

04:30.080 --> 04:33.640
I'll leave you alone. If you see Tony,
tell him I'm looking for him.

04:33.720 --> 04:35.040
Will I see you later?

04:35.120 --> 04:36.800
Okay, I'll find you later.

04:39.440 --> 04:40.280
What happened?

04:40.360 --> 04:42.840
-I hope I can fix it, but…
-But?

04:43.520 --> 04:46.200
But it seems the Monzo Twins have bailed.

04:47.920 --> 04:50.400
-I have bad news too.
-What?

04:50.480 --> 04:53.040
I don't think
we'll be able to pay the bank.

04:56.120 --> 04:56.960
Look at this.

04:59.920 --> 05:04.160
"Your payment has not been received."
"Please pay as soon as possible."

05:06.400 --> 05:09.120
-How much time do we have to pay?
-Very little.

05:11.360 --> 05:14.160
According to these numbers,
we could lose Cielo Grande.

05:15.480 --> 05:19.160
We only have four male competitors
and one female one for Summer Crush.

05:31.280 --> 05:33.800
Hi. Sorry for being late.

05:35.440 --> 05:36.280
Are you okay?

05:36.360 --> 05:39.280
Yeah, I'm a little worried
about some hotel stuff,

05:39.360 --> 05:40.960
but it's nothing we can't fix.

05:41.040 --> 05:44.120
I saw you carrying stuff
with your friends. Are they moving?

05:44.200 --> 05:47.960
Something like that, yeah.
We're kind of digging up the past.

05:48.040 --> 05:50.800
Yeah, Tony told me something like that.

05:55.320 --> 05:57.240
Are you saying I can't keep secrets?

05:57.320 --> 05:58.440
Kind of.

05:58.960 --> 06:00.200
Pedro, let's go.

06:16.240 --> 06:18.720
Hello.

06:20.640 --> 06:21.720
Hello.

06:26.680 --> 06:29.040
Can't interrupt in the middle of a song.

06:29.120 --> 06:32.480
-What can I help you with?
-Monzo Twins? Out. We're leaving.

06:33.640 --> 06:34.920
You're going?

06:35.000 --> 06:36.000
All right.

06:36.640 --> 06:38.120
I'll put you in the system.

06:43.280 --> 06:44.720
What time are you leaving?

07:07.400 --> 07:08.520
-Hi.
-What's up?

07:08.600 --> 07:11.000
Hi. Sorry, but breakfast is over.

07:11.080 --> 07:12.200
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

07:12.280 --> 07:14.240
Come on. Please make an exception.

07:14.320 --> 07:16.360
We need food to be able to function.

07:18.400 --> 07:19.280
It's okay, Nati.

07:19.360 --> 07:23.480
But considering they're leaving,
we shouldn't even wait on them.

07:23.560 --> 07:26.000
Sit down.
I'll see what's left in the kitchen.

07:26.080 --> 07:28.000
-Thanks, guys.
-You're the best.

07:28.080 --> 07:29.120
Really.

07:31.640 --> 07:34.360
-Isn't that great?
-Have you packed your bags, boys?

07:34.440 --> 07:35.760
Yeah.

07:35.840 --> 07:38.120
Well, kind of.
We want a better explanation.

07:38.200 --> 07:39.040
Both of us.

07:40.320 --> 07:41.560
Explanation. Okay.

07:43.040 --> 07:44.040
I'm so sorry,

07:44.120 --> 07:47.560
but these people are giving me a headache
with their back and forth.

07:47.640 --> 07:50.760
It's the best thing for you.
They can't treat us this way.

07:51.600 --> 07:52.840
-Strange.
-Yeah.

07:52.920 --> 07:54.800
They treat us wonderfully.

07:55.440 --> 07:58.920
Matrix, look. I just met
the love of my life. I can't leave now.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.080
Trust me. I know what I'm doing.

08:01.160 --> 08:02.800
Matrix, seriously.

08:03.320 --> 08:04.480
Fix the problem.

08:04.560 --> 08:08.720
You'd really make me incredibly happy.
I have to sweeten that heart.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.680
That's all right.

08:13.760 --> 08:17.960
The only thing that matters is
you're happy, hearts and all that.

08:18.720 --> 08:22.680
I'll try. I can't promise anything,
because these people are really difficult.

08:25.200 --> 08:27.360
-Matrix, one little thing.
-Yeah.

08:27.440 --> 08:30.160
I have a very special request

08:30.680 --> 08:33.480
for room 301.

08:33.560 --> 08:35.120
301, okay.

08:36.360 --> 08:37.200
"Chocolate,

08:37.720 --> 08:38.640
chocolate,

08:39.280 --> 08:40.280
chocolate,

08:41.080 --> 08:42.400
and chocolate."

08:43.520 --> 08:44.880
Consider it done.

09:12.360 --> 09:14.200
And then they broke their contract.

09:14.280 --> 09:17.360
August wanted to save Cielo Grande
with their posts, but now…

09:17.920 --> 09:19.520
I don't know.

09:20.760 --> 09:22.720
Maybe it's better they leave.

09:24.080 --> 09:26.920
If they treat you badly,
it's not gonna work.

09:28.280 --> 09:31.560
Tell me, what do you do besides working?

09:32.640 --> 09:36.200
Well, when I was 15,
I fell in love with a Mexican instructor

09:36.280 --> 09:39.400
who left me
in the friend zone and broke my heart.

09:41.040 --> 09:44.080
And I discovered
what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.

09:45.760 --> 09:48.480
This casual encounter must mean something.

09:51.560 --> 09:52.640
Maybe it's a sign.

09:53.760 --> 09:54.600
I don't know.

09:55.200 --> 09:57.640
-Obviously I'm not 15--
-But…

09:57.720 --> 09:59.000
But…

09:59.520 --> 10:02.640
But this is different.

10:02.720 --> 10:05.040
-We're working now.
-Working?

10:06.560 --> 10:09.320
Lovebirds, I'm recording.

10:20.320 --> 10:22.960
Yeah, we were this close,
but nothing happened.

10:23.040 --> 10:24.160
She turned away?

10:24.240 --> 10:27.240
-I don't know. Something like that.
-Did she say anything?

10:27.320 --> 10:29.840
Yeah, something,
but I don't remember what.

10:29.920 --> 10:33.280
Buddy, this could be
a typical case of the friend zone.

10:33.360 --> 10:35.000
What? No.

10:36.040 --> 10:38.880
What you've told me
is the first step, buddy. Denial.

10:38.960 --> 10:40.960
Then comes rage or anger,

10:41.040 --> 10:44.080
which is when you realize
that maybe you're in the zone.

10:44.160 --> 10:47.720
Then the third stage, and this is
where things get a little complicated,

10:47.800 --> 10:49.240
which is bargaining.

10:49.320 --> 10:51.080
-Bargaining?
-Yeah, buddy.

10:51.160 --> 10:53.160
Bargaining is when you're like…

10:54.000 --> 10:57.200
trying to make the person
you like want to go out with you.

10:57.280 --> 10:59.720
Want, no. Accept, which is different.

10:59.800 --> 11:02.880
-Know what the fourth stage is?
-There's a fourth stage?

11:02.960 --> 11:06.000
Yeah, buddy.
The fourth stage is terrible. Depression.

11:06.080 --> 11:10.760
It's when you find out there's
no way to get out of the friend zone.

11:10.840 --> 11:13.600
Finally, the last stage,
which I would say is the best.

11:13.680 --> 11:15.680
The best? Let's see. Tell me what it is.

11:15.760 --> 11:17.360
Acceptance, buddy.

11:17.440 --> 11:20.320
Acceptance is when
you're totally aware of your situation

11:20.400 --> 11:23.120
and you know
it's almost impossible to get out of it.

11:23.200 --> 11:26.960
-Charly, can't you see your theory is--
-Exactly what you're going through.

11:27.040 --> 11:29.480
No, it's crazy.
I'm not even at stage three.

11:30.080 --> 11:31.120
Excuse me.

11:31.640 --> 11:34.400
-We're here. Are we missing anything?
-No, nothing.

11:34.480 --> 11:36.200
Welcome. Is everything all right?

11:36.280 --> 11:39.960
I ask you to please come here
with my friend, the friend-zoned,

11:40.040 --> 11:41.400
or Julián,

11:42.040 --> 11:45.760
or with me until the last class, okay?
Okay, thanks. Let's go.

11:46.360 --> 11:47.400
Buddy, believe me.

11:47.480 --> 11:50.360
I know so much about
the friend zone I could give lessons.

11:50.440 --> 11:51.840
That's not a bad idea.

11:52.960 --> 11:56.720
Charly, about acceptance… That was a joke,
and you weren't serious, right?

12:18.600 --> 12:20.000
Are you gonna work or what?

12:24.960 --> 12:26.800
Hello. Hi.

12:27.920 --> 12:30.440
False alarm.
We're not leaving. We're staying.

12:30.520 --> 12:32.480
-You're staying.
-We're staying, yes.

12:32.560 --> 12:33.400
All right.

12:46.240 --> 12:48.160
Your rooms have been reassigned.

12:48.760 --> 12:50.040
What do you mean?

12:51.280 --> 12:53.880
-Reassigned.
-That can't be. We have a contract.

12:55.520 --> 12:57.360
Can you check, please?

12:58.520 --> 12:59.560
Thank you.

12:59.640 --> 13:00.760
I'll check, but…

13:11.400 --> 13:12.680
Toxic Garbage?

13:15.200 --> 13:17.080
I'm a fan of Toxic Garbage.

13:23.120 --> 13:24.680
There's nothing I can do.

13:26.800 --> 13:28.880
What if you call Luz?

13:31.560 --> 13:32.680
No way.

13:33.560 --> 13:34.600
Anyway…

13:36.680 --> 13:39.200
-Maybe, yeah. Now…
-Okay.

13:39.280 --> 13:40.720
-I'll call her now.
-Okay.

13:41.680 --> 13:44.640
-I'll let you know.
-Okay. All right.

13:45.240 --> 13:46.600
-Bye. Yeah.
-Bye.

13:58.280 --> 14:00.200
Look, that's the channel.

14:12.320 --> 14:13.400
This is the river.

14:14.320 --> 14:15.320
It's awesome.

14:17.960 --> 14:22.640
Look, I know
it's none of my business but you and Tony…

14:23.800 --> 14:26.080
No, it happened a long time ago.

14:27.680 --> 14:30.240
I was 15, and he was 19.

14:30.960 --> 14:31.880
I had a crush.

14:32.480 --> 14:35.040
And he saw me as a kid.

14:35.120 --> 14:37.560
Nothing happened,
and we ended up being friends.

14:37.640 --> 14:42.200
Well, just so you know,
he didn't come here in the best mood.

14:42.280 --> 14:46.240
But ever since he saw you,
he hasn't stopped smiling.

14:46.840 --> 14:50.080
Honestly, it's been a long time
since I've seen him so happy.

14:51.800 --> 14:53.800
-Really?
-Yeah.

14:58.320 --> 15:01.800
-Excuse me. Am I interrupting?
-You took a long time with your rope.

15:02.680 --> 15:05.360
Considering that rope was your job,

15:05.960 --> 15:08.040
I was hoping you'd thank me.

15:34.200 --> 15:35.640
Really good, Steffi.

15:49.320 --> 15:50.760
Watch out, Steffi.

15:50.840 --> 15:53.440
Remember what we always say.
One trick at a time.

15:53.520 --> 15:56.600
Don't think about the next trick
until you've landed.

16:00.800 --> 16:02.000
Well done.

16:12.680 --> 16:15.960
Perfect. The landing was
well controlled and it showed.

16:28.920 --> 16:31.960
Good. A lot of style.
Can you keep training?

16:32.040 --> 16:33.800
As you wish, Coach.

16:45.640 --> 16:46.840
Here's your juice.

16:48.600 --> 16:49.680
So Nati,

16:49.760 --> 16:52.360
how has it been going at Cielo?

16:52.440 --> 16:53.320
Great.

16:53.400 --> 16:54.560
-Really?
-Yeah.

16:54.640 --> 16:55.640
Something happen?

16:55.720 --> 16:57.280
Nothing special,

16:57.880 --> 16:59.880
but there are really interesting people.

17:06.320 --> 17:08.080
Excuse me. I'm looking for Luz.

17:08.160 --> 17:11.280
She's on the river
with Steffi Navarro. Can I help you?

17:11.360 --> 17:12.200
No.

17:12.880 --> 17:15.880
Yes. I have a request from Juan.

17:16.480 --> 17:17.600
Okay.

17:17.680 --> 17:19.880
-Chocolate.
-Let's see. Chocola…

17:20.880 --> 17:22.360
Yes, it's a lot of chocolate.

17:22.440 --> 17:25.120
It's a really important request
from Juan for Steffi.

17:25.760 --> 17:28.280
Okay, Nati, can you help with this?

17:28.360 --> 17:30.160
-Yes, I'll handle it.
-Perfect.

17:35.760 --> 17:37.360
Really good session.

17:37.440 --> 17:40.120
-I'll see you later.
-Yes, see you later.

17:40.200 --> 17:41.280
Bye.

17:47.200 --> 17:50.000
I noticed you were really
working on your technique.

17:50.080 --> 17:51.680
You should get some rest.

17:51.760 --> 17:52.840
See? I told you.

17:52.920 --> 17:57.440
This competition is perfect.
I can be active without risking too much.

17:58.040 --> 17:59.760
The perfect competition.

18:00.440 --> 18:01.320
What?

18:02.880 --> 18:05.400
Steffi, you know perfectly well
in this competition

18:05.480 --> 18:06.840
no one's at your level.

18:06.920 --> 18:08.240
And I don't need anyone.

18:08.320 --> 18:11.600
I came here to have fun.
Nothing and no one can take that from me.

18:12.200 --> 18:13.040
Okay.

18:13.120 --> 18:14.720
Then have fun.

18:16.720 --> 18:18.880
Anyone else? Anyone else signing up?

18:18.960 --> 18:21.960
Visiting the wake park
is an adventure only for the brave.

18:22.040 --> 18:23.160
Don't miss out.

18:23.240 --> 18:26.040
-You'll see, girls. You'll love it.
-It's really good.

18:26.120 --> 18:29.240
-I was thinking about what you said.
-Good exercise.

18:29.320 --> 18:32.160
No. What stage am I in
in your friend zone theory?

18:32.680 --> 18:34.640
I'd say you're in--

18:34.720 --> 18:36.760
You ate without me? You didn't wait?

18:36.840 --> 18:39.880
No, we're waiting.
And we ordered what you put in the chat.

18:39.960 --> 18:42.800
Yeah, reserved table.
And the food's already here.

18:42.880 --> 18:47.000
Awesome. After, we're going with Nati
to work in the storeroom. Coming?

18:47.080 --> 18:48.320
-Of course.
-Yeah.

18:48.400 --> 18:49.480
Sky Vibes at night?

18:49.560 --> 18:51.080
-Yes.
-Help me with the drinks?

18:51.840 --> 18:52.760
Let's go.

18:53.400 --> 18:57.160
-Luz, do you have a minute?
-What's up?

18:58.560 --> 19:00.240
What happened the other day

19:01.240 --> 19:02.400
wasn't good.

19:16.440 --> 19:19.160
<i>Neither lose, nor win</i>

19:19.240 --> 19:22.160
<i>Our strength is trying</i>

19:22.240 --> 19:23.600
<i>It is now</i>

19:24.160 --> 19:29.120
<i>It's risking embracing the truth</i>

19:29.960 --> 19:30.800
The truth?

19:31.800 --> 19:34.040
We could say "friendship"
instead of "truth."

19:34.640 --> 19:35.480
Let's see.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.320
<i>Neither lose, nor win</i>

19:39.400 --> 19:41.600
<i>Our strength is trying</i>

19:41.680 --> 19:43.040
<i>It is now</i>

19:43.120 --> 19:44.200
<i>It's risking</i>

19:44.280 --> 19:47.560
<i>Embracing friendship</i>

19:48.760 --> 19:49.920
-I love it.
-Yeah.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.840
Your song's turning out really good.

19:51.920 --> 19:52.880
Our song.

19:53.400 --> 19:54.520
You added a lot.

19:55.120 --> 19:57.600
It was an idea before,
and now it's so much more.

19:57.680 --> 19:59.920
We make a great team, don't we?

20:00.000 --> 20:00.840
Totally.

20:06.040 --> 20:07.040
"Warm Beauty."

20:09.080 --> 20:11.840
I was just thinking
that could be our next song.

20:11.920 --> 20:13.200
And what's it about?

20:14.600 --> 20:16.800
About emotions

20:16.880 --> 20:18.480
or the summer,

20:19.040 --> 20:22.480
or we could come up with it together.

20:22.560 --> 20:23.880
Yeah, I'd love to.

20:32.320 --> 20:35.040
She just apologized out of the blue?

20:37.040 --> 20:38.480
-Matrix?
-Yeah.

20:39.400 --> 20:40.520
All happy and easily,

20:40.600 --> 20:43.400
she said they're staying?
Like nothing happened?

20:44.960 --> 20:47.280
Yeah, I hope she keeps her word.

20:48.320 --> 20:51.880
She seems sorry,
but who knows? Anything could happen.

21:00.120 --> 21:02.560
Reception, two new rooms for competitors.

21:02.640 --> 21:04.560
Check with maintenance.

21:04.640 --> 21:07.040
<i>Copy. But not received, boss.</i>

21:07.600 --> 21:10.200
-What part?
<i>-I only heard the end.</i>

21:10.280 --> 21:12.000
<i>I had my headphones on.</i>

21:12.520 --> 21:16.240
Two new rooms for competitors.
Check with maintenance, please.

21:16.320 --> 21:17.800
<i>No worries, boss.</i>

21:20.720 --> 21:22.160
Good news.

21:22.240 --> 21:25.000
Two new participants.
And they left a message. Here.

21:25.080 --> 21:26.160
Call this number.

21:26.240 --> 21:29.360
An interested participant
needs more info about the event.

21:29.440 --> 21:31.640
-Great. I'll take care of it, man.
-Perfect.

21:31.720 --> 21:34.080
-I'll go get the new guests.
-Okay.

22:47.480 --> 22:51.160
WHO ARE YOU?

22:56.920 --> 22:58.400
And who are you?

23:15.960 --> 23:18.720
<i>Wind in my face without a care</i>

23:18.800 --> 23:21.400
<i>Mark my soul with sunshine</i>

23:21.480 --> 23:23.800
<i>The heat hits my palm softly</i>

23:23.880 --> 23:28.000
<i>I save the moment, I feel that calm</i>

23:28.840 --> 23:30.840
<i>I feel that calm</i>

23:32.280 --> 23:35.000
<i>Warm beauty</i>

23:35.080 --> 23:37.760
<i>That feeling</i>

23:37.840 --> 23:40.640
<i>Warm beauty</i>

23:40.720 --> 23:42.800
<i>An invitation</i>

23:42.880 --> 23:45.680
<i>I move through the waves</i>

23:45.760 --> 23:48.440
<i>That's my strength</i>

23:48.520 --> 23:51.480
<i>Warm beauty</i>

23:55.680 --> 23:57.120
-Good.
-Good.

23:57.200 --> 23:59.920
-It's coming.
-It needs something, but we're close.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.520
I thought of an ending.
Can you play the chords?

24:03.120 --> 24:03.960
Let's see.

24:05.520 --> 24:07.680
<i>Only connection</i>

24:08.520 --> 24:11.720
<i>Warm beauty</i>

24:11.800 --> 24:13.320
<i>An invitation</i>

24:15.080 --> 24:17.640
<i>Warm beauty</i>

24:18.640 --> 24:20.920
-I love it.
-Done. Yeah, that's it.

24:21.000 --> 24:23.160
-Great.
-We'll follow your lead, Nati.

24:23.240 --> 24:27.480
<i>We'll follow you, Nati, we'll follow you</i>
<i>We'll follow you, Nati, we'll follow you</i>

24:27.560 --> 24:29.720
<i>We'll follow you, Nati, we'll follow you</i>

24:29.800 --> 24:31.800
<i>We'll follow you, Nati, we'll follow you</i>

24:31.880 --> 24:33.880
<i>We'll follow you, Nati, we'll follow you</i>

24:38.680 --> 24:39.560
Testing.

24:40.080 --> 24:42.200
I can't believe
this equipment still works.

24:42.280 --> 24:44.040
Points for reusing it.

24:44.800 --> 24:47.680
We're gonna need some lights
to finish the stage.

24:48.400 --> 24:50.120
-Can we use this?
-What is that?

24:50.640 --> 24:52.440
The sails from the old boat.

24:52.520 --> 24:54.480
We could use them behind the stage.

24:54.560 --> 24:57.760
-Another point for reusing.
-Let's go.

24:57.840 --> 25:00.200
It's coming along.
It looks different already.

25:00.280 --> 25:03.680
Yeah. Less like a storeroom
and more like Sky Vibes.

25:07.640 --> 25:10.920
Remember recycled stuff goes there.

25:11.840 --> 25:14.400
I'll put it here, then.
Points for recycling.

25:14.920 --> 25:17.120
And what's that pile there for?

25:17.200 --> 25:19.280
It's for when we don't know what to do.

25:19.360 --> 25:21.720
Points for stuff
we don't know what to do with.

25:21.800 --> 25:23.480
-Us.
-Perfect.

25:23.560 --> 25:25.400
-We're a team!
-We're a team!

25:46.560 --> 25:48.600
-Nati, hi.
-Hi.

25:49.120 --> 25:50.680
It seems you have an admirer.

25:51.400 --> 25:52.840
-Chocolate?
-Yeah.

25:53.720 --> 25:55.600
-Thanks.
-You're welcome. Enjoy.

25:59.240 --> 26:00.760
I hate chocolate.

26:03.520 --> 26:08.080
"You've sweetened my heart."
"Now let me sweeten yours."

26:09.520 --> 26:11.840
"Forever thankful. Juan."

26:22.360 --> 26:24.360
Why are you here? Did anyone see you?

26:24.440 --> 26:27.080
No one saw me.
I wanted to talk to you for a minute.

26:27.800 --> 26:30.640
Okay. You can stay,
but I'm gonna take a bath.

26:30.720 --> 26:32.280
Go ahead. I'll wait for you.

26:33.120 --> 26:34.280
And that?

26:34.920 --> 26:35.760
Chocolate?

26:36.400 --> 26:37.800
Check out who sent it.

26:37.880 --> 26:39.120
Your buddy, Juan.

26:40.520 --> 26:41.400
It's all yours.

26:41.480 --> 26:44.600
-You know I don't like chocolate.
-What luck. I love it.

26:47.840 --> 26:50.200
All right, I'm gonna take a bath.
Be right back.

27:06.120 --> 27:08.440
How's everything? How'd today go?

27:08.520 --> 27:09.360
Good.

27:12.120 --> 27:14.480
These first few days have been great, huh?

27:16.520 --> 27:18.320
I like spending time with you.

27:19.200 --> 27:21.080
You're like the sister I never had.

27:21.760 --> 27:23.160
-Hi.
-Hi.

27:23.240 --> 27:24.120
Hi.

27:24.840 --> 27:26.440
-Hi.
-Gather around, please.

27:30.440 --> 27:31.720
We have good news.

27:31.800 --> 27:33.280
Good!

27:33.360 --> 27:36.200
Three new participants
and several inquiries.

27:36.280 --> 27:37.320
Seriously?

27:38.240 --> 27:41.440
Steffi's post yesterday
put the competition on people's radar.

27:42.040 --> 27:43.600
-Great!
-Way to go, Steffi.

27:43.680 --> 27:45.960
I also spoke with the Twins' agent.

27:46.040 --> 27:48.800
They're staying
and they're gonna mention Cielo Grande.

27:48.880 --> 27:49.960
We fixed that.

27:50.040 --> 27:53.440
-Good, Luz!
-Luz, you fixed it. Give yourself credit.

27:53.520 --> 27:54.680
Let's give Luz a hand.

27:54.760 --> 27:56.280
-Great, Luz!
-Well done!

27:56.360 --> 27:58.240
Thank you.

27:58.320 --> 28:01.520
We're also making
a ton of progress with Sky Vibes.

28:01.600 --> 28:03.520
In a few days, it'll be ready.

28:03.600 --> 28:06.840
Plus I have an idea for the opening.
Let's see what you think.

28:07.520 --> 28:08.480
Sky Vibes

28:08.560 --> 28:10.160
ready to vibrate.

28:10.240 --> 28:11.400
What? No.

28:11.480 --> 28:12.520
-No?
-No.

28:12.600 --> 28:15.000
Vibrate? They'll think
it's a massage chair.

28:17.520 --> 28:18.960
-Augusto, no.
-No.

28:19.040 --> 28:21.680
-Let's change it.
-All right. You're right.

28:25.920 --> 28:29.280
I don't think
I'm gonna have dinner. I can't.

28:30.520 --> 28:32.800
You shouldn't have eaten
so much chocolate.

28:32.880 --> 28:34.280
I didn't eat that much.

28:52.680 --> 28:54.240
Is this letter from Mom?

28:54.320 --> 28:55.600
What are you doing?

28:57.800 --> 28:59.800
There's a secret hidden at Cielo Grande?
