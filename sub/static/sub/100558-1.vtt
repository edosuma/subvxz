00:01.268 --> 00:05.971
(wine splashing)
(gentle hum)

00:08.943 --> 00:11.677
(glasses clink)

00:23.090 --> 00:25.657
(owl hooting)

00:31.198 --> 00:34.099
(chimes jingling)

00:36.871 --> 00:39.738
(gentle music)

00:39.740 --> 00:42.408
(woman sighs)

00:42.410 --> 00:43.509
- [Woman] No.

00:47.615 --> 00:49.481
- [Daughter] Hey, Mom.

00:49.483 --> 00:50.749
Come here.

00:50.751 --> 00:52.418
Don't worry about
that, I got it.

00:54.388 --> 00:55.888
- [Woman] Sure.

00:55.890 --> 00:58.323
- [Daughter] You know,
all you have to do is ask

00:58.325 --> 00:59.925
for a bit of help around here.

01:01.028 --> 01:03.062
Nothing to be ashamed
of, asking for help.

01:03.064 --> 01:04.563
- [Daughter] Yeah.

01:04.565 --> 01:07.766
Well, you know, I like to
get things done myself.

01:07.768 --> 01:09.635
- Well, I'm here.

01:10.704 --> 01:13.839
Look, what happened
next door to poor Barry,

01:13.841 --> 01:15.774
it just puts things
into perspective.

01:15.776 --> 01:18.510
- Yeah, well, I mean, Barry
had problems for years.

01:18.512 --> 01:19.978
He was getting on, honey.

01:19.980 --> 01:22.414
It's hardly surprising
it happened.

01:22.416 --> 01:27.019
- Yeah, well, all I'm saying
is you take it easy, all right?

01:27.021 --> 01:28.487
- Sure.

01:28.489 --> 01:30.722
- [Daughter] Hey, you
want this up on the line?

01:30.724 --> 01:32.524
- Yeah, if you want.

01:32.526 --> 01:35.294
Can you make sure you hang
it up nicely this time?

01:35.296 --> 01:36.562
The last time you hung it up,

01:36.564 --> 01:39.298
it was all creased and
I had to iron it all.

01:39.300 --> 01:40.365
- Sure, Mom.

01:47.308 --> 01:48.740
- Took me twice as long.

01:52.813 --> 01:53.645
(owl hooting)

01:53.647 --> 01:56.348
(ominous music)

02:13.067 --> 02:15.167
(soft screeching)

02:15.169 --> 02:17.736
(tense music)

02:33.754 --> 02:38.824
(chimes jingling)
(soft screeching)

02:43.998 --> 02:46.899
(soft screeching)

03:01.482 --> 03:04.349
(soft screeching)

03:22.303 --> 03:25.204
(soft screeching)

03:33.547 --> 03:36.448
(soft screeching)

03:44.058 --> 03:46.959
(loud screeching)

03:54.535 --> 03:57.169
(monster snarling softly)

03:57.171 --> 03:58.136
(screams)

03:58.138 --> 04:00.639
(monster screeching loudly)

04:00.641 --> 04:01.940
(groans)

04:01.942 --> 04:05.444
(screaming)
(monster growling loudly)

04:05.446 --> 04:08.347
(water splashing)

04:18.158 --> 04:21.360
(ominous music)

04:21.362 --> 04:22.261
Carol?

04:29.937 --> 04:30.836
Carol!

04:38.112 --> 04:39.011
Carol!

04:43.083 --> 04:46.718
(monster screeches softly)

04:57.231 --> 04:58.430
(gasps)

04:58.432 --> 05:01.333
(panting quickly)

05:31.598 --> 05:34.399
(floor creaking)

06:26.854 --> 06:29.921
(whimpering softly)

06:49.610 --> 06:52.744
(bullets clattering)

07:00.487 --> 07:03.522
(bullet clattering)

07:12.966 --> 07:16.134
(footsteps treading)

07:28.048 --> 07:31.783
(monster screeching loudly)

07:34.221 --> 07:36.955
(woman gasping)

07:41.595 --> 07:44.996
(monster snarls softly)

07:46.333 --> 07:48.433
(woman whimpering loudly)

07:48.435 --> 07:50.101
(monster screeches loudly)

07:50.103 --> 07:55.173
(woman screaming)
(gun firing)

08:03.951 --> 08:06.117
- Mom, just let me, okay?

08:06.119 --> 08:08.353
It's not a big deal.

08:08.355 --> 08:10.322
If Dad's sick, we're there.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.091
- I said no.

08:14.428 --> 08:17.395
I'm not having you all
drag yourselves down here.

08:18.932 --> 08:21.199
Your dad is fine, Rita.

08:21.201 --> 08:23.034
You need to listen to me.

08:24.705 --> 08:28.173
He's had these happen to
him the last few years.

08:28.175 --> 08:29.641
It's his pacemaker.

08:31.011 --> 08:34.145
Ever since they corrected it,
he's had these heart issues.

08:34.147 --> 08:37.415
- Mom, we're coming
tomorrow, okay?

08:37.417 --> 08:41.453
I don't care how big or small
the issue is, we're there.

08:41.455 --> 08:42.554
- You're being foolish.

08:42.556 --> 08:44.689
It'll take you half a day, Rita.

08:44.691 --> 08:45.891
- So?

08:45.893 --> 08:47.259
Alan's got that old truck.

08:47.261 --> 08:49.628
We can make a trip of
it, the kids and us.

08:50.964 --> 08:53.131
We're coming, all right?

08:53.133 --> 08:56.535
You're not sitting in
that house alone, no way.

08:57.671 --> 09:00.171
- You're just like your
father, you know that?

09:01.074 --> 09:02.107
I love you.

09:02.109 --> 09:03.308
- Love you too, Mom.

09:10.417 --> 09:14.052
(monster screeches softly)

09:14.054 --> 09:16.621
(tense music)

09:32.506 --> 09:34.439
- We're going, Alan, okay?

09:34.441 --> 09:35.874
We're going.

09:35.876 --> 09:37.642
- You don't need
to tell me twice.

09:38.612 --> 09:39.744
I'll ring work in the morning

09:39.746 --> 09:41.346
and we can head straight there.

09:42.449 --> 09:43.882
- It's my dad.

09:43.884 --> 09:45.650
I can't not be with him.

09:45.652 --> 09:46.551
- Hey.

09:47.721 --> 09:49.154
Come on.

09:49.156 --> 09:50.989
- [Rita] Do think
he's gonna be okay?

09:52.459 --> 09:56.127
- Your dad's been in and
out of there time and again.

09:56.129 --> 09:58.997
He probably knows
the nurses by name.

09:58.999 --> 10:00.065
He'll be fine.

10:01.568 --> 10:02.867
- We should tell the kids.

10:02.869 --> 10:04.436
- You leave the kids to me.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.939
You're gonna have
a long, hot bath.

10:09.810 --> 10:11.610
- You should clean
out that truck.

10:11.612 --> 10:13.211
The kids will have a fit.

10:13.213 --> 10:15.013
- Yeah, I was
thinking that myself.

10:16.950 --> 10:20.719
- Thank you for
being so supportive.

10:21.922 --> 10:23.421
- You don't have to say that.

10:31.832 --> 10:34.666
(birds chirping)

10:40.374 --> 10:42.207
Hey, I got those.

10:42.209 --> 10:43.074
- Thanks.

10:46.480 --> 10:48.513
- Don't go inside,
they're still going at it.

10:50.317 --> 10:53.218
- Look, should I just
say that he can't come?

10:53.220 --> 10:54.619
I don't wanna be
driving for hours

10:54.621 --> 10:56.621
with them screaming in
my ear the whole time.

10:56.623 --> 10:58.623
- Just tell them to break up.

10:58.625 --> 10:59.591
- Ben, don't.

10:59.593 --> 11:01.192
She's your sister.

11:01.194 --> 11:02.460
They're having a rough time.

11:02.462 --> 11:04.129
- Hell, everyone knows
the amount they argue.

11:04.131 --> 11:06.131
(chuckles)

11:06.133 --> 11:08.199
- Don't encourage him.

11:08.201 --> 11:09.067
- Yeah, Dad.

11:15.409 --> 11:17.242
- Hey, I'll get these.

11:17.244 --> 11:19.110
- Oh, I'm sorry, I should just

11:19.112 --> 11:20.712
put my granddad
on hold, shall I?

11:20.714 --> 11:22.580
- That's not what
I'm saying, Charlie.

11:22.582 --> 11:24.249
Stop putting words
into my mouth.

11:24.251 --> 11:26.584
Look, I'm just saying that
I had the weekend planned.

11:26.586 --> 11:28.586
I spent some money, no,
I wanted you to get it

11:28.588 --> 11:30.321
and appreciate it.
- Ty, I get it.

11:30.323 --> 11:33.124
You spent some money on a
fancy restaurant or whatever,

11:33.126 --> 11:36.194
but I have to go
with my family now.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.296
- Why don't you get it, Charlie?

11:38.298 --> 11:40.065
Why am I always the one trying?

11:45.972 --> 11:48.106
- Well, hello, little lady.

11:48.975 --> 11:50.008
Can I offer you a ride?

11:50.010 --> 11:51.543
- Oh, my god, stop.

11:51.545 --> 11:54.079
- You realize there's only
one bed in the back, right?

11:54.081 --> 11:56.548
- Actually, there's not
much room at Grandma's,

11:56.550 --> 11:58.683
so I was hoping you wouldn't
mind crashing in the back

11:58.685 --> 12:00.351
while we stay there?

12:00.353 --> 12:01.419
- Fine.

12:01.421 --> 12:02.287
- [Rita] Thank you, baby.

12:02.289 --> 12:04.022
(smacks lips)

12:04.024 --> 12:06.024
- Okay, he's coming with us.

12:06.026 --> 12:07.726
Please don't give us a lecture,

12:07.728 --> 12:10.995
and, no, we will not
screw in Gran's house.

12:10.997 --> 12:12.564
And, please, no sex talk.

12:13.900 --> 12:14.833
- Okay.

12:14.835 --> 12:16.868
Well, then, Ty, welcome.

12:18.004 --> 12:22.373
Everybody, hop on board
the van of wonders.

12:22.375 --> 12:23.575
- Jeez.

12:23.577 --> 12:25.610
- Is he gonna do that
the entire drive?

12:25.612 --> 12:26.845
(Rita laughs)

12:26.847 --> 12:28.146
- Come on.

12:28.148 --> 12:30.815
(gentle music)

12:49.536 --> 12:51.002
- [Tyler] Can still
make it worth our while.

12:51.004 --> 12:53.204
Can still make a
weekend out of it.

12:53.206 --> 12:56.741
It's about us two being
together now, right?

13:06.219 --> 13:07.418
- How long have we got?

13:07.420 --> 13:09.654
- Oh, about another
10 miles or so.

13:11.525 --> 13:13.124
- Want me to take over?

13:13.126 --> 13:14.292
- No, I'm good, buddy.

13:18.365 --> 13:19.297
- Is Mom, okay?

13:20.667 --> 13:24.669
I mean, obviously not, but how
is she doing, do you think?

13:24.671 --> 13:26.137
Like, in all seriousness.

13:27.541 --> 13:30.742
- Think the quicker she's
with your grandma, the better.

13:30.744 --> 13:31.910
She just worries.

13:31.912 --> 13:35.647
You know how your mom's like.

13:35.649 --> 13:37.649
- Do you think
Grandpa will be okay?

13:40.420 --> 13:41.886
- That's a tough one, buddy.

13:43.523 --> 13:44.422
I don't know.

13:45.525 --> 13:46.724
I don't have an answer.

13:48.461 --> 13:50.395
He's been in and out of
that hospital all year

13:50.397 --> 13:51.963
since he had the heart attack.

13:53.533 --> 13:54.432
It's...

13:56.269 --> 14:00.338
I hope so, but he isn't
getting any younger.

14:01.441 --> 14:02.340
Hey.

14:03.510 --> 14:04.742
Hey, come on.

14:04.744 --> 14:05.643
None of this.

14:06.746 --> 14:09.380
- [Ben] I just need
a second, that's all.

14:10.617 --> 14:11.516
- Okay.

14:13.420 --> 14:15.086
I'll get us in.

14:15.088 --> 14:16.855
You let us know
when you're ready.

14:18.859 --> 14:20.191
- [Tyler] Oh, hey,
Alan, quick question.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.359
Do we have any snacks?

14:21.361 --> 14:22.694
- Ty, we sure do.

14:24.698 --> 14:27.332
Okay, what you want, huh?

14:27.334 --> 14:30.301
(muffled speaking)

14:33.640 --> 14:37.108
- I don't get why people live
in random places like this.

14:37.110 --> 14:39.844
Like, what a way to live.

14:39.846 --> 14:42.247
- People like different
stuff, I guess.

14:45.452 --> 14:46.351
- Hey.

14:47.153 --> 14:48.219
You gonna tell them?

14:51.758 --> 14:53.858
- It's not the
right time, Charlie.

14:55.495 --> 14:56.561
And this clearly
isn't the right time

14:56.563 --> 14:58.529
to be talking about this.

14:58.531 --> 14:59.664
- I thought that's
the point of you

14:59.666 --> 15:01.266
coming back from college.

15:01.268 --> 15:03.468
Get it off your
chest, tell them.

15:04.671 --> 15:06.771
They gotta find out
sooner or later.

15:42.008 --> 15:43.241
(door thuds)

15:43.243 --> 15:45.009
- Sorry, I didn't
mean to wake you.

15:46.179 --> 15:47.111
- Are we leaving?

15:49.382 --> 15:51.883
Kids, you ready?

15:51.885 --> 15:52.784
- Let's go!

15:56.856 --> 15:59.524
(gentle music)

17:03.656 --> 17:05.957
You go inside, we'll
sort the bags out, okay?

17:07.360 --> 17:09.260
Kids, give me a
hand with the bags.

17:13.800 --> 17:16.534
(clock ticking)

17:22.442 --> 17:23.341
- Mom?

17:52.906 --> 17:53.805
Mom?

18:37.550 --> 18:38.516
- Where's Grandma?

18:42.388 --> 18:43.955
- She's not here.

18:43.957 --> 18:45.123
- Are you sure?

18:45.125 --> 18:46.224
- I've checked every room.

18:46.226 --> 18:47.325
I can't find her.

18:49.195 --> 18:51.629
- Maybe she's gone next
door to see Sanndra.

18:52.465 --> 18:53.297
- Okay.

18:53.299 --> 18:54.665
Well, can we go check?

18:55.802 --> 18:57.535
- [Alan] Kids, we're
going next door.

18:57.537 --> 18:59.036
Just stay here.

19:01.441 --> 19:04.175
(ominous music)

19:06.613 --> 19:09.480
(chimes jingling)

19:21.427 --> 19:23.828
- I just don't understand it.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.263
It's not like Mom.

19:36.376 --> 19:39.577
- Look, maybe everybody
leaves their doors open.

19:39.579 --> 19:41.045
We're not in the city.

19:41.047 --> 19:42.313
- It's not like that, Alan.

19:42.315 --> 19:44.348
People don't leave
their doors open.

19:47.654 --> 19:49.220
Sanndra, you here?

21:16.075 --> 21:19.076
Something's not right
here, I can feel it.

21:20.146 --> 21:23.347
- Look, let's just
go back to the house.

21:24.284 --> 21:25.916
Let's phone the local hospital.

21:25.918 --> 21:28.252
Maybe they've gone
to see your dad.

21:28.254 --> 21:29.854
- Alan, I just--
- Hey.

21:29.856 --> 21:30.755
Come on.

21:31.758 --> 21:32.657
Come on.

21:47.807 --> 21:50.007
- [Ben] Do you think
something's wrong?

21:50.009 --> 21:51.509
- [Charlie] No.

21:51.511 --> 21:53.377
No, I think Grandma left.

21:54.714 --> 21:57.348
- [Ben] Think she
left the door open?

21:57.350 --> 21:59.684
- [Charlie] If she was
in a rush, then sure.

22:00.787 --> 22:02.753
- And who would have driven her?

22:02.755 --> 22:04.188
- [Charlie] What do you mean?

22:04.190 --> 22:05.456
- Grandma doesn't drive.

22:07.360 --> 22:10.428
Hasn't for years, so who would
have taken her out of here?

22:14.400 --> 22:18.402
- In other news, Charlie says
you're gonna tell your folks

22:18.404 --> 22:20.504
that you got that girl
pregnant this weekend,

22:20.506 --> 22:22.206
one at Bafflin
College, congrats.

22:23.910 --> 22:24.809
- Really?

22:25.912 --> 22:27.078
- Shit, Ben--

22:27.080 --> 22:28.679
- Why are you telling
people, Charlie?

22:30.383 --> 22:33.150
- Ben, come on, don't
be like that, I--

22:33.152 --> 22:35.186
(sighs)

22:35.188 --> 22:37.688
(sighs)

22:37.690 --> 22:38.589
Nice one.

22:47.934 --> 22:49.533
(switch hook clacking)

22:49.535 --> 22:50.401
- [Rita] Nothing.

22:53.806 --> 22:54.322
- [Ben] Any news?

22:54.323 --> 22:54.839
- [Alan] Ben, can I
borrow your phone?

22:54.841 --> 22:56.340
I can't get a signal.

22:56.342 --> 22:57.274
- What's going on?

22:58.244 --> 22:59.210
- Not sure yet.

23:03.649 --> 23:04.615
Come on.

23:06.319 --> 23:09.487
(Alan sighs)

23:09.489 --> 23:11.756
Charlie, Ty, can you
check your phones?

23:11.758 --> 23:12.690
Are they working?

23:14.527 --> 23:15.726
- It's dead.

23:15.728 --> 23:17.361
- We're in the
middle of nowhere.

23:17.363 --> 23:19.563
Yeah, they don't normally
get a signal this far out.

23:19.565 --> 23:20.464
- Yeah.

23:22.368 --> 23:25.269
Me and your mum might
need to go into town.

23:25.271 --> 23:26.537
Just sit tight, okay?

23:27.607 --> 23:28.572
- Are you okay?

23:30.777 --> 23:32.143
Dad, what's going on?

23:32.145 --> 23:33.411
- Nothing's wrong.

23:33.413 --> 23:35.012
We need to get a signal.

23:35.014 --> 23:36.313
- [Ben] I'm coming with you.

23:36.315 --> 23:37.848
- No, just stay where you are.

23:37.850 --> 23:38.749
- No.

23:39.952 --> 23:40.851
I'm coming.

23:42.054 --> 23:42.953
- Let him come.

23:44.257 --> 23:47.224
Charlie, you stay here and
wait for Grandma to get back.

23:47.226 --> 23:48.125
- Sure.

23:57.904 --> 23:59.537
(engine whirs)

23:59.539 --> 24:00.771
- The battery's flat.

24:01.707 --> 24:03.307
I must have left the lights on.

24:05.111 --> 24:07.111
- You didn't leave
the lights on, Dad.

24:07.113 --> 24:10.581
- Well, then I don't know,
but the thing won't start.

24:11.918 --> 24:14.218
- Well, it was working
perfectly fine before.

24:16.622 --> 24:20.157
- Look, let's walk into
town, it's not far.

24:20.893 --> 24:21.792
Okay, let's go.

24:23.896 --> 24:25.162
Ty, can you do me a favor?

24:25.164 --> 24:26.163
- [Tyler] Of course.

24:26.165 --> 24:27.665
- Can you have a
look at the jeep

24:27.667 --> 24:29.266
and see if you can figure
out why it won't start?

24:29.268 --> 24:30.601
- On it.

24:30.603 --> 24:32.903
- Okay, we need to go into town.

24:32.905 --> 24:34.872
We'll be back within the hour.

24:34.874 --> 24:36.507
- And if Grandma gets back?

24:36.509 --> 24:38.576
- Just hang tight
with her, okay?

24:39.412 --> 24:40.377
- Sure.
- Ty.

24:40.379 --> 24:41.479
Push this over here, will you?

24:41.481 --> 24:42.913
- [Tyler] Sure.

24:42.915 --> 24:45.716
(birds chirping)

25:00.366 --> 25:01.866
- Bill's.

25:01.868 --> 25:03.234
He knows Nan, right?

25:03.236 --> 25:05.002
She sees him weekly?

25:05.004 --> 25:06.403
Maybe she sent him along.

25:06.405 --> 25:07.771
- No.

25:07.773 --> 25:09.073
Something's wrong.

25:09.075 --> 25:10.708
Something's off.

25:10.710 --> 25:12.409
Why are all the stores closed?

25:12.411 --> 25:14.778
- Rita, calm down, all right?

25:14.780 --> 25:17.982
I know you're panicked, but
there's gotta be a reason.

25:17.984 --> 25:18.883
- Hey, guys.

25:20.920 --> 25:22.319
The back entrance, come on.

25:30.396 --> 25:31.862
- Grandma's old car is dead.

25:35.635 --> 25:37.001
Any luck?

25:37.003 --> 25:38.402
- I don't get it.

25:41.974 --> 25:44.475
Never seen anything like it.

25:44.477 --> 25:46.143
It all seems fine down here.

25:47.280 --> 25:50.247
There's no issues with
the battery, the fuel.

25:52.385 --> 25:53.751
It's like it just gave up.

25:54.887 --> 25:56.253
- Well, there has to
be something, right?

25:56.255 --> 25:59.590
It can't just collapse and die.

25:59.592 --> 26:01.992
- Yeah, I just don't get it.

26:24.050 --> 26:24.949
- Bill?

26:27.019 --> 26:28.319
- Hello?

26:28.321 --> 26:29.320
Anyone here?

26:31.390 --> 26:32.289
- Bill!

26:46.806 --> 26:49.440
(uneasy music)

26:54.146 --> 26:56.880
(ominous music)

28:26.005 --> 28:26.970
What is it?

28:27.773 --> 28:28.672
- I...

28:30.342 --> 28:31.241
I...

29:20.259 --> 29:21.225
- Hey.

29:21.227 --> 29:22.459
Hey, you okay?

29:25.264 --> 29:26.230
(man gurgling)

29:26.232 --> 29:27.364
Hey, come on.

29:30.336 --> 29:31.401
- I'm sorry.

29:32.404 --> 29:34.238
- Sorry, what?
- They made something

29:36.208 --> 29:37.541
in the lab.

29:39.411 --> 29:42.312
It got out.

29:42.314 --> 29:44.181
- What got out?

29:44.183 --> 29:45.349
What got out?

29:48.988 --> 29:51.121
- You gotta get outta here.

29:52.758 --> 29:53.857
- You're okay.

29:53.859 --> 29:55.492
Hey, stay with me.

29:55.494 --> 29:56.827
Hey.

29:56.829 --> 29:57.661
Come on.

29:57.663 --> 29:58.495
Hey.

29:58.497 --> 29:59.863
Stay with me.

29:59.865 --> 30:02.599
You're gonna be okay.
(man gurgling)

30:02.601 --> 30:05.102
You're all right, man.

30:05.104 --> 30:06.336
- Go!

30:06.338 --> 30:07.504
Run!

30:07.506 --> 30:10.073
(man gurgles)

30:42.441 --> 30:44.908
(monster screeches softly)

30:44.910 --> 30:48.111
(footsteps pattering)

30:48.981 --> 30:52.583
(monster screeches softly)

30:58.424 --> 31:01.124
(ominous music)

32:12.798 --> 32:13.630
(jar crashes)

32:13.632 --> 32:16.133
(ominous music)

32:16.135 --> 32:19.703
(monster snarling softly)

32:31.884 --> 32:34.885
(glass clattering)

32:41.827 --> 32:44.261
(tense music)

32:44.263 --> 32:47.898
(monster screeches softly)

33:51.196 --> 33:54.765
(monster exhaling softly)

35:29.628 --> 35:30.460
(monster growls)

35:30.462 --> 35:33.363
(thrilling music)

36:05.564 --> 36:08.632
(whimpering softly)

36:31.957 --> 36:32.923
- Help.

36:32.925 --> 36:33.823
Help me.

36:37.095 --> 36:40.163
(whimpering softly)

36:44.436 --> 36:45.335
Help.

36:48.640 --> 36:51.374
(crying softly)

36:52.544 --> 36:53.443
Help me.

36:58.016 --> 36:58.915
- Grandma?

37:15.500 --> 37:16.633
- What is it?

37:19.938 --> 37:21.204
We found this.

37:28.013 --> 37:29.212
Alan, what is it?

37:30.048 --> 37:32.115
(tense music)

37:32.117 --> 37:34.784
- [Alan] Something's
seriously wrong here.

37:34.786 --> 37:36.519
We need to go leave, now.

37:41.059 --> 37:41.958
- [Rita] Alan.

37:43.962 --> 37:45.428
(gasps)

37:45.430 --> 37:46.563
- Oh, my god.

37:48.066 --> 37:50.133
(gasps)

37:51.970 --> 37:53.336
What could have done that?

37:54.906 --> 37:59.009
- I don't know, but we don't
wanna be here if it comes back.

38:00.612 --> 38:01.511
We gotta go.

38:03.148 --> 38:04.214
We gotta go.

38:06.685 --> 38:10.420
(Grandma whimpering softly)

38:12.024 --> 38:12.922
- Help me.

38:20.132 --> 38:20.964
(monster growling softly)

38:20.966 --> 38:23.033
(gasps)

38:31.810 --> 38:34.377
(tense music)

38:38.116 --> 38:41.184
(Charlie screaming)
(Grandma screaming)

38:41.186 --> 38:43.987
(monster growling)
(Charlie grunting)

38:43.989 --> 38:45.355
(Charlie groans)

38:45.357 --> 38:46.723
(Charlie screaming)

38:46.725 --> 38:49.259
(whimpering loudly)

38:49.261 --> 38:52.095
(monster growls)

38:53.131 --> 38:55.699
(Charlie crying loudly)
(monster growling)

38:55.701 --> 38:58.501
(Charlie screams)
Run, baby, run!

38:58.503 --> 38:59.836
Run!

38:59.838 --> 39:02.872
(Charlie grunts)

39:02.874 --> 39:04.174
Run, baby, run!

39:05.243 --> 39:07.844
(Charlie whimpering loudly)

39:07.846 --> 39:09.379
(monster howling)

39:09.381 --> 39:10.847
(Charlie screams)

39:10.849 --> 39:13.750
(thrilling music)

39:14.586 --> 39:17.554
(Charlie groaning)

39:26.932 --> 39:29.666
(door rattling)

39:33.372 --> 39:35.238
(screaming)

39:35.240 --> 39:38.808
(monster snarling loudly)

39:49.020 --> 39:51.254
(panting)

40:04.569 --> 40:09.639
(Charlie gasps)
(monster screeches loudly)

40:13.612 --> 40:16.479
(screams)

40:16.481 --> 40:19.048
(monster growling)

40:19.050 --> 40:24.120
- Run, Ty, run!

40:25.357 --> 40:26.656
- Charlie, what the
hell's going on?

40:26.658 --> 40:28.191
- Ty, run!

40:28.193 --> 40:29.325
- What's happening to you?

40:29.327 --> 40:31.828
- Go!
- Charlie, what's happening?!

40:31.830 --> 40:35.498
(monster screeches loudly)

40:36.435 --> 40:37.300
- Come on!

40:40.872 --> 40:43.907
(whimpering softly)

40:46.445 --> 40:49.846
(ominous music)

40:49.848 --> 40:51.481
- What is going on?

40:53.585 --> 40:54.451
Charlie.

41:10.669 --> 41:12.302
- Keys!

41:12.304 --> 41:13.970
Where are the keys?! Come on!

41:13.972 --> 41:15.839
Quick, come on, the keys!

41:15.841 --> 41:18.441
(keys jingle)
Oh!

41:18.443 --> 41:20.610
- Charlie, what the hell?

41:26.151 --> 41:28.284
Charlie, what's going on?

41:30.989 --> 41:31.888
- Get in!

41:32.991 --> 41:34.290
- Charlie.

41:34.292 --> 41:36.526
(screams)

42:48.199 --> 42:49.632
(screams)

42:49.634 --> 42:50.500
Charlie.

42:51.770 --> 42:52.635
Help me.

42:57.409 --> 42:58.675
Help me.

42:58.677 --> 42:59.943
Help.

42:59.945 --> 43:00.710
Help.

43:00.712 --> 43:02.045
Help me.

43:02.047 --> 43:07.116
(monster growls)
(Charlie screaming)

43:11.957 --> 43:14.624
- What do you think did this?

43:14.626 --> 43:15.625
Some beast?

43:16.728 --> 43:20.263
- I have no idea,
but whatever it is,

43:20.265 --> 43:23.099
to do that, it's gotta be huge.

43:25.103 --> 43:26.469
- We've gotta find my mom.

43:28.840 --> 43:31.908
(whimpering softly)

43:34.245 --> 43:35.211
(thuds loudly)
(Charlie gasps)

43:35.213 --> 43:37.780
(tense music)

43:47.592 --> 43:48.758
(monster snarls softly)

43:48.760 --> 43:51.661
(thudding loudly)

43:53.598 --> 43:57.166
(monster snarling softly)

44:18.923 --> 44:23.993
(whimpering softly)
(footsteps treading)

44:27.832 --> 44:32.902
(trailer rattling loudly)
(Charlie screaming)

44:46.351 --> 44:48.951
(monster howls)
(Rita gasps)

44:48.953 --> 44:50.119
- Oh, my god.

44:52.991 --> 44:56.392
- What the hell makes
a sound like that?

44:57.228 --> 44:58.127
- Charlie.

45:04.402 --> 45:06.235
- What happened here?

45:07.505 --> 45:11.174
(monster screeches softly)

45:12.277 --> 45:13.710
(monster screeches softly)

45:13.712 --> 45:16.446
(ominous music)

46:38.530 --> 46:41.130
(monster snarling softly)

46:41.132 --> 46:44.534
(monster snarls loudly)

46:57.015 --> 46:58.014
What is it?

47:46.064 --> 47:48.464
We can't leave them out there.

47:48.466 --> 47:49.899
What if they're alive?

47:49.901 --> 47:51.467
We gotta get them.

47:52.370 --> 47:54.937
- It's sonic radar.

47:55.874 --> 47:57.340
Okay?

47:57.342 --> 48:00.710
Whatever the hell
that thing is, right,

48:00.712 --> 48:02.411
it's making those noises

48:04.015 --> 48:08.584
and it's using the sound to
reflect it off everything, yeah,

48:09.888 --> 48:12.455
to you understand the
makeup of its surroundings.

48:14.292 --> 48:16.292
It can't see us.

48:19.130 --> 48:20.646
Okay?

48:20.647 --> 48:22.163
So it's listening
to our movements,

48:23.635 --> 48:25.635
waiting for us to make a noise.

48:29.474 --> 48:31.641
It's hunting us by sound.

48:37.048 --> 48:37.947
Okay?

48:46.424 --> 48:49.392
- Whatever the hell
that thing was,

48:52.530 --> 48:54.931
it was a face full of teeth.

49:03.541 --> 49:06.275
(ominous music)

49:11.816 --> 49:14.383
(lock clacks)

49:16.721 --> 49:19.455
(grunts softly)

49:22.827 --> 49:25.728
(window creaking)

49:28.533 --> 49:30.766
- [Charlie] Damn it.

49:30.768 --> 49:31.667
Damn.

49:39.410 --> 49:41.143
- I think it's gone.

49:42.180 --> 49:44.347
Now's our chance, okay?

49:44.349 --> 49:45.247
- What?

49:50.521 --> 49:52.355
- Now's our chance.

49:52.357 --> 49:53.856
I gotta get her outta there.

49:56.894 --> 49:58.127
- Dad, no.

49:58.129 --> 50:00.129
- [Rita] Alan, you can't
go out there, not yet.

50:01.466 --> 50:03.032
- We haven't got a choice.

50:05.103 --> 50:06.969
It could come back
at any second.

50:08.973 --> 50:10.573
- [Rita] Alan, please.

50:10.575 --> 50:11.941
Please?

50:11.943 --> 50:13.009
- Shh, okay?

50:17.315 --> 50:18.214
Okay?

50:19.951 --> 50:20.850
All right?

50:26.758 --> 50:29.492
(door creaking)

50:31.963 --> 50:34.363
(owl hoots)

50:47.278 --> 50:48.144
Stay.

51:22.814 --> 51:24.180
(Alan gasps)

51:24.182 --> 51:26.816
(somber music)

51:48.706 --> 51:51.574
(whimpers softly)

52:13.731 --> 52:14.797
- Dad.
- Shh.

52:17.034 --> 52:17.933
Shh.

52:18.836 --> 52:19.735
Shh.

52:22.140 --> 52:24.874
(ominous music)

53:11.155 --> 53:14.890
(monster screeching softly)

53:21.232 --> 53:22.198
There. Go.

53:22.200 --> 53:25.734
(monster screeching softly)

53:25.736 --> 53:26.802
Go!

53:26.804 --> 53:27.736
Now!

53:27.738 --> 53:29.004
(monster screeches softly)

53:29.006 --> 53:30.306
(screams)

53:30.308 --> 53:33.242
(screaming)

53:33.244 --> 53:35.811
(tense music)

53:46.591 --> 53:48.390
- [Charlie] Dad.

53:48.392 --> 53:50.893
(Charlie whimpering loudly)

53:50.895 --> 53:53.562
- [Rita] Ben, I need some help.

53:53.564 --> 53:56.265
I need some help.

53:56.267 --> 53:58.234
Let's get her upstairs.

54:01.839 --> 54:02.905
(Charlie coughing)

54:02.907 --> 54:03.906
Set her down.

54:03.908 --> 54:08.177
(Charlie whimpering softly)

54:08.179 --> 54:09.078
It's okay.

54:11.949 --> 54:13.515
We're gonna get some supplies.

54:20.224 --> 54:22.958
(ominous music)

54:32.737 --> 54:34.703
- You're gonna be okay.

54:36.307 --> 54:38.040
It'll be okay.

54:38.042 --> 54:39.208
- Ty is dead.

54:41.012 --> 54:43.746
(crying softly)

54:48.953 --> 54:50.452
- [Rita] Look at me, okay?

54:50.454 --> 54:52.254
You're gonna be okay.

54:56.794 --> 54:58.527
Look at me, you're
gonna be okay.

55:02.300 --> 55:03.465
Take these, okay?

55:08.139 --> 55:10.306
Bill had to know we came.

55:11.142 --> 55:13.876
(ominous music)

55:19.717 --> 55:23.285
(monster growling softly)

55:24.388 --> 55:28.457
(monster snarling softly)

55:28.459 --> 55:31.193
(crying softly)

55:32.963 --> 55:34.530
- Grandma's alive.

55:39.170 --> 55:40.469
- [Rita] It's okay.

55:40.471 --> 55:42.538
It's okay, it's gonna be okay.

55:42.540 --> 55:44.073
I'm here.

55:44.075 --> 55:46.075
What happened to
Grandma, Charlie?

55:50.581 --> 55:52.481
- She was in the barn.

55:54.685 --> 55:56.251
She was in danger.

55:57.988 --> 55:59.822
- What do you mean?

55:59.824 --> 56:02.725
(Charlie coughing)

56:15.106 --> 56:18.173
(whimpering softly)

56:24.548 --> 56:25.881
Water.

56:25.883 --> 56:27.116
Go get her some water.

56:31.522 --> 56:33.722
It's okay, it's gonna be okay.

56:33.724 --> 56:35.190
I'm here.

56:35.192 --> 56:36.425
Mom's here.

56:36.427 --> 56:38.060
It's gonna be okay.

56:58.649 --> 56:59.548
She's sleeping.

57:00.818 --> 57:02.117
She has something.

57:04.555 --> 57:06.288
I've never seen
anything like it.

57:08.692 --> 57:10.359
Some kind of virus.

57:15.099 --> 57:16.365
- Maybe from her wounds?

57:17.768 --> 57:19.868
- You wouldn't get that type
of virus from an infection

57:19.870 --> 57:21.570
from what's happened to her.

57:24.408 --> 57:26.141
(sighs)

57:26.143 --> 57:27.843
I don't know what it is.

57:29.880 --> 57:31.613
She needs to see a doctor.

57:33.451 --> 57:34.883
- Dad could still be alive.

57:36.854 --> 57:37.753
- I know.

57:44.094 --> 57:46.662
- We need to do something, Mom.

57:46.664 --> 57:49.998
- Charlie said Grandma was
at the end of the stalls

57:50.000 --> 57:52.501
in the stable in a room.

57:53.871 --> 57:56.505
If she's alive, we need
to get her outta there.

57:57.842 --> 58:02.678
- That thing out there,
how do we get past it?

58:05.616 --> 58:07.783
- Your dad said it was
depending on sound.

58:11.956 --> 58:17.025
If it can't see, it's waiting
on us to make mistakes, right?

58:20.531 --> 58:22.030
So we don't make a mistake.

58:24.034 --> 58:26.435
We get to where we
need in silence.

58:26.437 --> 58:30.372
We find them, we get them back
here, and we wait for help.

58:30.374 --> 58:32.140
- We can't just
sit here and wait.

58:33.644 --> 58:35.944
We've gotta get out of here.

58:35.946 --> 58:38.413
- Half of the family
are in bad shape.

58:39.917 --> 58:41.917
- I can go.

58:41.919 --> 58:43.452
I'm fine.

58:43.454 --> 58:46.255
I can run and keep
running until I get help.

58:46.257 --> 58:49.358
- What if there's more of them?

58:49.360 --> 58:52.261
We don't know what's out there.

58:52.263 --> 58:54.096
What if whatever the
hell that thing is

58:54.098 --> 58:57.299
is taking over town by town?

58:57.301 --> 58:58.734
It's not safe.

58:58.736 --> 59:01.136
- It's better than
waiting for it to get us.

59:03.073 --> 59:05.841
- Let's just find Grandma,

59:07.144 --> 59:08.810
then get Dad, okay?

59:15.252 --> 59:16.385
- That thing,

59:20.858 --> 59:22.991
what do you think it was?

59:25.930 --> 59:26.862
(sighs)

59:26.864 --> 59:28.130
- When I was a little girl,

59:30.501 --> 59:33.101
they told us to stay away
from the barracks nearby.

59:34.238 --> 59:36.171
They said it was a
contamination zone

59:37.408 --> 59:39.775
and that it was
off-limits to the public.

59:40.945 --> 59:43.078
- The place we drove
through on the way here?

59:44.148 --> 59:45.981
- It's been there
all my entire life.

59:47.551 --> 59:50.652
We all made up stories
about what goes on in there.

59:50.654 --> 59:52.220
- [Ben] Like what?

59:53.657 --> 59:55.290
- No one ever believed them

59:55.292 --> 59:58.660
'cause no one saw it and
nothing ever happened.

59:58.662 --> 1:00:00.862
- You can tell me just about
anything right now, Mom,

1:00:00.864 --> 1:00:02.664
and I won't think you're crazy.

1:00:04.735 --> 1:00:08.503
- They said that they made
military weapons in there.

1:00:12.309 --> 1:00:15.544
- Do you think that
thing was manmade?

1:00:16.847 --> 1:00:18.747
- Hybrid or something.

1:00:22.720 --> 1:00:25.287
- Why'd they let it out on us?

1:00:26.290 --> 1:00:27.689
- Or it escaped.

1:00:33.230 --> 1:00:35.030
I can't sit here any longer.

1:00:35.032 --> 1:00:36.498
I gotta go get Grandma.

1:00:36.500 --> 1:00:38.133
- [Ben] I'm not
leaving you alone.

1:00:38.135 --> 1:00:39.001
- No.

1:00:39.003 --> 1:00:40.168
Charlie needs you.

1:00:41.038 --> 1:00:42.838
- Dad and Grandma are out there,

1:00:42.840 --> 1:00:45.240
and you won't be able to
help them on your own.

1:00:45.242 --> 1:00:46.608
I'm coming, Mom.

1:00:46.610 --> 1:00:48.176
- No.

1:00:48.178 --> 1:00:50.646
Listen to me, for once
in your life, Ben.

1:00:50.648 --> 1:00:52.681
You're staying here, okay?

1:00:54.318 --> 1:00:55.484
Look after your sister.

1:01:11.869 --> 1:01:16.004
(Charlie coughing)
- Watch, you're gonna be okay.

1:01:16.006 --> 1:01:17.205
Look at me.

1:01:17.207 --> 1:01:18.140
Look at me.

1:01:18.142 --> 1:01:19.107
(Charlie whimpering loudly)

1:01:19.109 --> 1:01:21.009
You're gonna be fine.

1:01:21.011 --> 1:01:22.511
You're gonna be fine.

1:01:22.513 --> 1:01:26.181
(Charlie coughing)

1:01:26.183 --> 1:01:28.417
- What's happening to me?!

1:01:37.728 --> 1:01:41.129
(Ben whimpering softly)

1:01:50.207 --> 1:01:53.008
(water splashes)

1:01:55.279 --> 1:01:57.979
(ominous music)

1:02:00.551 --> 1:02:03.118
(tense music)

1:02:27.311 --> 1:02:28.310
Fuck.

1:02:28.312 --> 1:02:31.379
(whimpering softly)

1:02:34.184 --> 1:02:37.919
(Charlie whimpering softly)

1:04:13.383 --> 1:04:15.450
(gasps)

1:04:41.845 --> 1:04:42.744
- Mom.

1:04:54.358 --> 1:04:57.759
(monster snarls softly)

1:05:02.966 --> 1:05:06.701
(Grandma whimpering softly)

1:05:11.842 --> 1:05:13.408
- Please, help me.

1:05:15.412 --> 1:05:17.479
- How do I get this off?

1:05:19.516 --> 1:05:20.482
- Hurry up.

1:05:20.484 --> 1:05:21.616
- Shh.

1:05:21.618 --> 1:05:22.851
Shh.

1:05:22.853 --> 1:05:24.319
Shh.

1:05:24.321 --> 1:05:25.921
We gotta be quiet.

1:05:25.923 --> 1:05:27.389
Please, Mom, shh.

1:05:28.992 --> 1:05:30.358
It's gonna be okay.

1:05:30.360 --> 1:05:33.028
- Gonna be okay.
- Okay.

1:05:33.030 --> 1:05:36.598
(monster growling softly)

1:05:44.341 --> 1:05:49.411
(knife thuds)
(Charlie grunting)

1:05:55.118 --> 1:05:57.018
(knife thuds)

1:05:57.020 --> 1:05:58.987
(panting)

1:05:58.989 --> 1:06:01.990
(blood squirting)

1:06:01.992 --> 1:06:04.292
(groans softly)

1:06:04.294 --> 1:06:06.861
(tense music)

1:06:11.368 --> 1:06:13.435
(gasps)

1:06:32.789 --> 1:06:35.757
(monster growls softly)

1:06:39.196 --> 1:06:42.263
(whimpering softly)

1:06:53.877 --> 1:06:54.776
- Charlie.

1:06:59.149 --> 1:07:01.716
- I found something inside me.

1:07:04.554 --> 1:07:06.221
I gotta get it out.

1:07:07.257 --> 1:07:08.156
Come on.

1:07:10.560 --> 1:07:13.561
(Charlie groaning)

1:07:29.546 --> 1:07:33.114
(monster snarling softly)

1:07:37.087 --> 1:07:39.854
(crying softly)

1:07:50.434 --> 1:07:51.266
(water splashes)

1:07:51.268 --> 1:07:54.102
(gasping loudly)

1:08:05.148 --> 1:08:06.681
- Give me the knife.

1:08:06.683 --> 1:08:07.582
- No.

1:08:08.985 --> 1:08:11.052
- What the hell are you doing?

1:08:11.054 --> 1:08:13.288
- What is happening to me?

1:08:16.793 --> 1:08:20.195
Where are they all coming from?!

1:08:20.197 --> 1:08:21.096
Please.

1:08:24.901 --> 1:08:27.635
(crying softly)

1:08:31.174 --> 1:08:33.241
- We gotta get you help.

1:08:54.231 --> 1:08:57.298
(whimpering softly)

1:08:58.735 --> 1:09:02.137
(monster snarls softly)

1:09:15.385 --> 1:09:18.953
(monster snarling softly)

1:09:20.257 --> 1:09:21.389
(water splashes)
(Rita gasps)

1:09:21.391 --> 1:09:24.592
(monster snarls loudly)
(Rita screaming)

1:09:24.594 --> 1:09:26.427
(monster howling)
- Hey!

1:09:26.429 --> 1:09:29.264
(crying loudly)

1:09:29.266 --> 1:09:33.268
(Rita screams)
Come and get me!

1:09:37.974 --> 1:09:41.543
(monster snarls softly)

1:09:41.545 --> 1:09:44.546
(monster exhaling)

1:09:49.085 --> 1:09:52.987
(Ben whimpering softly)

1:09:52.989 --> 1:09:56.391
(monster growls softly)

1:10:00.130 --> 1:10:03.298
(Rita crying softly)

1:10:10.840 --> 1:10:13.508
- Get it off me, get it off me.

1:10:21.885 --> 1:10:23.885
(spiders clattering)
(Rita yelps)

1:10:23.887 --> 1:10:27.021
(Rita crying softly)

1:10:30.794 --> 1:10:31.626
Go.

1:10:31.628 --> 1:10:32.527
Go!

1:10:35.799 --> 1:10:37.699
- I love you.

1:10:37.701 --> 1:10:39.834
- I love you too, baby.

1:10:39.836 --> 1:10:42.370
(both crying)

1:11:38.995 --> 1:11:40.595
(horse shoes clanking)

1:11:40.597 --> 1:11:43.998
(monster snarls softly)

1:11:45.135 --> 1:11:48.670
(monster growling softly)

1:12:06.990 --> 1:12:08.323
(clapping loudly)

1:12:08.325 --> 1:12:12.060
(monster screeching loudly)

1:12:14.030 --> 1:12:15.730
- [Ben] No!

1:12:15.732 --> 1:12:17.932
(monster growling loudly)

1:12:17.934 --> 1:12:21.069
(splattering loudly)

1:12:27.644 --> 1:12:31.212
(monster growling loudly)

1:12:35.618 --> 1:12:38.786
(splattering loudly)

1:12:43.426 --> 1:12:46.494
(Ben crying softly)

1:12:50.967 --> 1:12:52.867
(shovel clanging)

1:12:52.869 --> 1:12:55.069
(screams)

1:12:57.807 --> 1:13:00.541
- Come get me!
(monster roars)

1:13:00.543 --> 1:13:04.078
(monster growling loudly)

1:13:06.383 --> 1:13:10.118
(monster screeching loudly)

1:13:16.359 --> 1:13:18.092

1:13:18.094 --> 1:13:21.562
(monster roaring loudly)

1:13:33.643 --> 1:13:36.444
(Rita screaming)

1:13:48.425 --> 1:13:51.993

(trailer rattling loudly)
(Rita crying loudly)
