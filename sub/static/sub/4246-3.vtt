WEBVTT

00:00.886 --> 00:02.686
You lost a big trial.

00:02.787 --> 00:04.487
This trial was lost, I didn't lose it.

00:04.488 --> 00:07.188
The Department has decided you need
to take a leave of absence.

00:07.189 --> 00:08.289
Previously on Scandal

00:08.290 --> 00:09.790
I just wanna know how
she did it, Olivia.

00:09.791 --> 00:11.090
<i>We won this case.</i>

00:11.091 --> 00:14.891
Quinn is going to live, and despite
popular opinion around here

00:14.892 --> 00:17.092
that is a good thing.

00:17.093 --> 00:19.793
Ready to work across the hall
from the Molotov mistress?

00:21.194 --> 00:22.894
- How are you?
- Fine

00:22.895 --> 00:25.095
Except my married ex-boyfriend
keeps calling me.

00:25.796 --> 00:26.896
I know you hate me,

00:26.983 --> 00:28.834
and I know you don't even wanna
be in the same room with me,

00:28.852 --> 00:32.503
but you have to forgive me.

00:32.522 --> 00:34.340
How's your pregnant wife?

00:34.374 --> 00:36.292
Tell me what to do,
and I'll do it.

00:36.326 --> 00:38.811
Let me go.

00:38.845 --> 00:39.879
<i>Red button.</i>

00:39.913 --> 00:41.096
Oh, come on, Senator.

00:41.131 --> 00:42.631
He was nowhere near
to pushing that...

00:42.666 --> 00:43.732
Our President was about to push

00:43.767 --> 00:44.850
that big, red,
scary-as-hell button

00:44.868 --> 00:46.151
and take us to war
in east Sudan

00:46.169 --> 00:48.153
on faulty,
irresponsible intelligence.

00:48.188 --> 00:49.187
<i>Which he quickly realized...</i>

00:49.205 --> 00:50.856
<i>And took</i>
<i>the appropriate steps...</i>

00:50.890 --> 00:52.107
<i>By firing</i>
<i>the C.I.A. director</i>

00:52.142 --> 00:53.926
<i>that he himself appointed</i>
<i>five minutes ago.</i>

00:53.960 --> 00:55.544
<i>What does it say for the people</i>
<i>that he surrounds himself with?</i>

00:56.478 --> 00:58.246
<i>This President's more in bed</i>
<i>with special interests</i>

00:58.280 --> 01:00.331
<i>than the last three</i>
<i>commanders in chief combined.</i>

01:00.365 --> 01:02.350
<i>Here we go.</i>
<i>Same old democrat partisan...</i>

01:02.384 --> 01:04.302
<i>Just look at the white house</i>
<i>logs, senator.</i>

01:04.336 --> 01:05.887
<i>They read like</i>
<i>a who's who of big pharma,</i>

01:05.938 --> 01:07.939
<i>N.R.A., insurance companies,</i>

01:07.973 --> 01:09.440
<i>oil tycoons</i>
<i>like Hollis Doyle</i>

01:09.475 --> 01:11.326
<i>are running around</i>
<i>like they own the place.</i>

01:11.360 --> 01:13.211
<i>Now I think the American people</i>
<i>deserve to know</i>

01:13.246 --> 01:14.379
<i>what is a man like that</i>

01:14.414 --> 01:16.198
<i>doing with nearly unlimited</i>
<i>access to the West Wing?</i>

01:16.932 --> 01:18.182
<i>And you'll get to respond</i>
<i>to that in a moment,</i>

01:18.217 --> 01:20.751
<i>Senator Gilbert,</i>
<i>after we take this short break.</i>

01:22.504 --> 01:26.624
Let me guess...some
third cousin died, then you went

01:26.658 --> 01:28.492
- out of the country.
- You're wearing pinstripes.

01:28.527 --> 01:30.011
Yeah, see, that doesn't explain

01:30.045 --> 01:31.612
the three years
of not returning my calls.

01:31.647 --> 01:33.798
- Pinstripes on prime time?
- Oh.

01:33.832 --> 01:36.416
You joined the fashion police.
That's where you've been.

01:36.450 --> 01:37.768
I don't care what you wear.

01:37.802 --> 01:39.219
Just know that no one will hear
a word you're saying

01:39.270 --> 01:40.954
when your suit is moving,
vibrating

01:40.989 --> 01:43.223
across their screen.
Also, you're sighing

01:43.258 --> 01:45.025
every time Senator Gilbert
speaks. Don't.

01:45.076 --> 01:46.793
It makes you seem
condescending and elitist,

01:46.845 --> 01:48.946
which frankly, doesn't exactly
matter, because I'm way

01:48.980 --> 01:50.447
- too distracted by the...
- Pinstripes. Yeah.

01:51.065 --> 01:52.615
So... am I in?

01:52.950 --> 01:55.051
Am I finally a client of
Olivia Pope and Associates?

01:55.903 --> 01:58.087
You agree I'm obviously in
need of your expertise.

01:58.121 --> 01:59.906
Good luck, Senator.

01:59.940 --> 02:01.424
You take care, Liv.

02:03.000 --> 02:09.074
Advertise your product or brand here

02:17.607 --> 02:19.392
I don't have cash on me.
I don't carry debit cards.

02:19.426 --> 02:21.527
If you're hoping for a ransom,
I don't have many friends.

02:21.561 --> 02:22.745
And if you're planning
on anything else,

02:22.779 --> 02:24.063
you should know that there are
security cameras

02:24.097 --> 02:25.548
trained on every inch
of this garage,

02:25.582 --> 02:27.416
and the police,
who I am dialing right now,

02:27.451 --> 02:29.068
will identify you
within minutes.

02:29.202 --> 02:31.020
There aren't any cameras,
Ms. Pope.

02:31.054 --> 02:32.855
In fact, this is the only part
of the building without cameras.

02:32.889 --> 02:34.757
That's why I'm here.
That's why I had...

02:34.791 --> 02:36.858
I-I'm sorry, okay?
I-I didn't mean to follow you

02:36.892 --> 02:38.010
or freak you out. It's just...
They're following me,

02:38.044 --> 02:39.561
and they're freaking <i>me</i> out,
and I-I didn't know

02:39.595 --> 02:40.979
where else to go,
and I know that you fix things

02:41.030 --> 02:42.948
and you solve problems, and I
got some problems, Ms. Pope...

02:42.982 --> 02:44.199
Some really,
really big problems.

02:44.233 --> 02:45.734
You need to get out of my car
<i>now!</i>

02:45.768 --> 02:47.285
Okay. I'm sorry.
My bad.

02:48.821 --> 02:49.938
They'll... they'll...
They'll kill me, Ms. Pope.

02:49.956 --> 02:51.907
You... you... let me explain.
You have to.

02:51.941 --> 02:53.158
They're following you, too!

02:53.209 --> 02:55.076
The government...
Th-they know everything.

02:55.110 --> 02:57.245
They know all about
the late-night phone calls

02:57.279 --> 03:00.415
from the West Wing!

03:02.705 --> 03:06.225
Sync and corrections by bellows

03:26.275 --> 03:28.159
I forgot how
tiny and cute they are...

03:28.194 --> 03:29.611
The baby clothes.

03:29.645 --> 03:31.246
Yeah.

03:33.082 --> 03:34.583
Feeling okay?

03:34.617 --> 03:36.334
Fine.

03:36.369 --> 03:37.619
Great, actually.

03:37.653 --> 03:39.087
'Cause if you're not sure...

03:39.121 --> 03:41.172
You can't cancel the hunt.

03:41.207 --> 03:42.624
I could, if you were ill.

03:42.658 --> 03:44.676
My pregnant wife
not feeling well.

03:44.710 --> 03:47.929
Never felt better.
The party loves when you hunt.

03:47.964 --> 03:50.048
Every year,
I have to spend a day

03:50.099 --> 03:51.883
- squatting in some weeds...
- A marsh.

03:51.934 --> 03:53.835
- Shooting helpless chickens...
- Ducks.

03:53.853 --> 03:56.337
- So the gun crazies can feel good...
- The good people of the N.R.A.

03:56.355 --> 03:58.356
- about some nut job...
- Citizen.

03:58.391 --> 04:00.775
Carrying a Kalashnikov assault
rifle in the back of his truck.

04:00.810 --> 04:02.477
Exercising the freedoms
afforded to him

04:02.511 --> 04:04.112
by the United States
constitution.

04:04.146 --> 04:05.313
You should go shoot the ducks.

04:05.347 --> 04:07.816
I should.
I'm an excellent shot.

04:07.850 --> 04:09.234
We have an enormous staff.

04:09.285 --> 04:11.202
I'm sure if you ask, someone
could fold those for you.

04:11.237 --> 04:14.022
It's a 32-piece antique
hand-embroidered layette

04:14.040 --> 04:15.523
with a personal note enclosed

04:15.541 --> 04:17.826
written by
Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth.

04:17.860 --> 04:19.577
Wow.

04:19.629 --> 04:22.363
Wow. I am folding
these baby clothes.

04:22.381 --> 04:25.000
You are <i>definitely</i>
folding those baby clothes.

04:33.476 --> 04:35.710
What?

04:35.728 --> 04:37.512
Nothing.

04:37.546 --> 04:42.350
It's just...

04:42.384 --> 04:43.885
This is nice.

04:45.888 --> 04:47.722
Yeah.

04:54.897 --> 04:56.731
Um...

04:56.749 --> 04:58.166
Oh, a double capp?

04:58.200 --> 05:00.068
Welcome back.

05:00.086 --> 05:02.120
And a half-caf, no foam,
one pump vanilla,

05:02.171 --> 05:03.338
extra hot soy latte.

05:03.372 --> 05:05.907
That's two pumps of vanilla,
<i>Lindsay.</i>

05:07.126 --> 05:08.076
She'll grow up and get
over it eventually.

05:08.094 --> 05:09.344
Just ride it out.

05:09.378 --> 05:11.079
They love to use what's
already in the room...

05:11.097 --> 05:13.048
Moldings, picture frames,
light fixtures,

05:13.082 --> 05:14.432
but now with this new program,
they don't need bugs,

05:14.467 --> 05:15.684
'cause we <i>are</i> the bugs...

05:15.718 --> 05:17.635
Our laptops, smartphones,
cell phones...

05:17.687 --> 05:19.587
Cell phones off. Everybody,
turn off your cell phones!

05:19.605 --> 05:21.723
They can track the signals.

05:21.757 --> 05:22.891
Why are you all just
standing there?

05:22.925 --> 05:25.060
What in the hell?
We eat on that table. Liv.

05:25.094 --> 05:26.394
This is Artie Hornbacher.

05:26.428 --> 05:28.446
Four hours ago, Artie stole this
from the N.S.A.

05:28.481 --> 05:30.982
You stole from
the National Security Agency?

05:31.033 --> 05:32.567
I'm not in this.
You're in this.

05:32.585 --> 05:34.686
- What is it? - It's called Thorngate.
It's everything.

05:34.720 --> 05:36.454
<i>Everything.</i> It blows
"we the people" to pieces.

05:36.489 --> 05:37.956
It removes the stars
and the stripes on the flag.

05:38.007 --> 05:39.140
Artie.

05:39.174 --> 05:40.892
- Sorry.
- He says he's got evidence

05:40.926 --> 05:42.494
the N.S.A.'s spying
on American citizens.

05:42.495 --> 05:43.628
What, like <i>spying</i> spying,

05:43.629 --> 05:46.698
like spying on American
citizens, here at home?

05:46.749 --> 05:47.849
That is everything.

05:47.883 --> 05:49.717
- I told you.
- Check him out.

05:50.736 --> 05:51.786
Arthur "Artie" Hornbacher...

05:51.821 --> 05:53.722
Low-level N.S.A.
Data entry specialist.

05:53.756 --> 05:55.807
Kept the same job, same
salary, for 16 years,

05:55.841 --> 05:57.609
which is either admirable
or pathetic,

05:57.660 --> 05:59.010
depending on your
definition of success.

05:59.044 --> 06:00.545
Easy menial job
which allows him time

06:00.579 --> 06:02.396
to follow his true passion
as an online crusader.

06:02.415 --> 06:04.048
- Against what?
- Every coffee chain in America.

06:04.100 --> 06:06.500
According to Artie,
the decaffeination process

06:06.518 --> 06:09.135
is a lie, and a coordinated
government/corporate deception.

06:09.671 --> 06:10.938
I was doing data entry,
same thing I always do,

06:10.972 --> 06:12.957
grouping batches by
source and entry point...

06:12.991 --> 06:15.259
Riyadh, Tel Aviv, Cairo,
Milan...

06:15.293 --> 06:16.894
But then this one batch...

06:16.945 --> 06:18.245
Suddenly, it's Columbus,
Philly, Portland.

06:18.280 --> 06:20.564
The addresses?
They're... they're all domestic.

06:20.598 --> 06:23.116
Do you know what that means?
Big brother. The eye in the sky.

06:23.134 --> 06:25.084
Millions of Americans are
being watched right now,

06:25.102 --> 06:26.070
and they have no idea.

06:26.121 --> 06:27.654
You told your supervisors
about this?

06:27.672 --> 06:28.972
Of course I did, repeatedly,

06:29.024 --> 06:30.190
and they said
they'd look into it,

06:30.225 --> 06:31.375
and then suddenly,
I'm being followed.

06:31.409 --> 06:34.144
So I took it, okay?
I took proof of Thorngate.

06:34.178 --> 06:35.962
- Maybe it was a mistake, but...
- Maybe?

06:35.996 --> 06:37.764
But I did it, so now
you have to hide me,

06:37.798 --> 06:39.399
because these people...
They won't just kill me.

06:39.433 --> 06:41.267
They'll make it look like
I never existed.

06:41.285 --> 06:43.837
He's also lactose-intolerant,
allergic to grass, honey,

06:43.871 --> 06:45.672
strawberries, peanuts,
is a type 1 diabetic,

06:45.690 --> 06:46.973
and believes that vaccines
are demonic.

06:47.007 --> 06:48.558
It's just a report
on border security.

06:48.592 --> 06:49.793
It's just the firewall.

06:49.844 --> 06:51.361
The N.S.A. protected
this program with everything

06:51.395 --> 06:53.546
in their arsenal, in case it
ever got stolen, like right now.

06:53.581 --> 06:54.965
Seriously, Liv,
he's certifiable.

06:54.999 --> 06:57.083
We can't take this guy on
as a client.

06:57.118 --> 06:58.385
Just 'cause he's weird
doesn't mean he's crazy.

06:58.419 --> 07:00.770
He thinks the N.S.A.'s
trying to kill him.

07:00.804 --> 07:02.689
- My story didn't make any
sense at first. - Still doesn't.

07:02.723 --> 07:04.540
- Everyone thought that
I was crazy, too. - Still do.

07:06.860 --> 07:10.013
Might be time to poke the hive.

07:14.733 --> 07:17.002
I know you by reputation.

07:17.036 --> 07:19.254
I'm happy to be able to
put a face to a name.

07:19.305 --> 07:21.056
Thanks for
seeing me on short notice.

07:21.090 --> 07:22.941
Of course.
Um, what can I help you with?

07:22.975 --> 07:25.460
- Just a few questions about Thorngate.
- Thorngate?

07:25.511 --> 07:27.862
Thorngate. I'm sorry. Am I supposed
to know what Thorngate is?

07:27.914 --> 07:30.065
I just learned about it myself
from Artie Hornbacher.

07:30.099 --> 07:32.334
Again, you've stumped me.
I feel like I'm failing a test here.

07:32.368 --> 07:33.935
Who is Artie Hornbacher?

07:33.970 --> 07:35.570
Just one of your
low-level employees.

07:35.621 --> 07:37.222
Complained to his bosses,
claiming your agency is

07:37.256 --> 07:39.591
using a program called
Thorngate to spy on Americans.

07:39.625 --> 07:40.825
Ring a bell?

07:40.843 --> 07:42.594
Wow. That would be something,
wouldn't it?

07:42.628 --> 07:45.430
Um, I'm not familiar with
this employee or this program,

07:45.464 --> 07:47.299
but I can assure you that
we take these accusations

07:47.333 --> 07:49.484
very seriously, and we
encourage our employees,

07:49.518 --> 07:51.686
from data entry
all the way to the top,

07:51.721 --> 07:54.289
to speak freely
if they witness any abuse

07:54.340 --> 07:57.791
or wrongdoings by their
colleagues here at the N.S.A.

07:57.826 --> 07:59.560
You know, let me check
with our oversight board

07:59.594 --> 08:00.978
and see if they've heard anything.

08:01.012 --> 08:02.813
Thanks, but I don't think
it's necessary.

08:02.847 --> 08:04.665
There's a 99% chance
Artie was a nut job,

08:04.749 --> 08:07.884
and you just gave me my last 1%.
Sorry to bother.

08:07.936 --> 08:08.903
No bother at all.

08:09.137 --> 08:11.154
Thanks, Corinne.
Very nice to meet you.

08:11.189 --> 08:12.456
Oh, my pleasure.

08:19.396 --> 08:20.847
Get him out.

08:20.881 --> 08:22.298
It's Olivia.
She says to get him out.

08:22.333 --> 08:24.050
- Let me talk to her.
- Where are we supposed to...

08:24.101 --> 08:25.969
This isn't a question, Abby.
It's an order.

08:26.003 --> 08:27.470
They knew he was data entry.
She didn't react.

08:27.488 --> 08:28.988
She didn't even blink
when I told her...

08:29.023 --> 08:30.023
I'm just asking whether...

08:30.074 --> 08:31.908
They know where he is!
They'll kill him.

08:31.942 --> 08:34.360
Tell huck to get our client
to safety right now!

08:43.393 --> 08:46.127
- Alissa, what are you doing?
- <i>You</i> are coming back to work,

08:46.161 --> 08:47.595
because if I have to fetch
Jane Powell

08:47.629 --> 08:50.615
another Chinese chicken salad
with no crunchies, no chicken,

08:50.649 --> 08:53.351
and dressing on the side,
I am <i>going to scream.</i>

08:53.385 --> 08:54.635
You miss me.

08:54.670 --> 08:56.487
I miss your lunch order
because it's simple

08:56.522 --> 08:58.139
and because Jane is
a horrible human being,

08:58.173 --> 08:59.574
who may, in fact,
be the pinnacle of everything

08:59.608 --> 09:01.159
that's wrong with the
American judicial system

09:01.193 --> 09:02.610
and who's telling
everyone who'll listen

09:02.628 --> 09:03.911
that you went totally
bonkers, by the way,

09:03.945 --> 09:05.997
so keep that in mind when...

09:08.600 --> 09:10.451
Oh, David.

09:10.486 --> 09:12.420
Look, I know it seems
like I've gone...

09:12.438 --> 09:14.622
All "Beautiful Mind"?
David.

09:14.656 --> 09:16.140
I can't go back
till I figure it out...

09:16.175 --> 09:20.310
How I lost this trial and how
Olivia Pope made it happen.

09:22.363 --> 09:24.197
You can walk me through it,
<i>once,</i>

09:24.232 --> 09:26.249
if you shave and put on pants.

09:26.300 --> 09:27.267
Okay, so hear me out...

09:27.301 --> 09:28.635
Pants.

09:31.655 --> 09:34.090
This is the least safe safe
house I've ever heard of.

09:34.124 --> 09:36.075
- Windows? - I've got a scrambler
jamming every frequency.

09:36.110 --> 09:37.460
There's no way
to see inside here.

09:37.494 --> 09:38.595
Except, of course,
using eyesight.

09:38.629 --> 09:40.446
- Okay, enough.
- It's decrypted.

09:40.480 --> 09:42.765
Let's see this thing.

09:44.902 --> 09:46.719
- Holy...
- I told you.

09:46.754 --> 09:48.754
- How does it work?
- Uh, give me a name.

09:48.772 --> 09:50.523
Someone you know.
Someone hard to crack.

09:50.558 --> 09:52.141
Cyrus Rutherford Beene.

10:01.718 --> 10:03.452
- Is that the...
- White House.

10:03.487 --> 10:05.121
- West Wing.
- 20 feet from the oval office.

10:05.172 --> 10:06.689
- The chief of staff.
- Nobody's safe.

10:06.723 --> 10:08.674
Is there audio?

10:11.227 --> 10:13.611
<i>...I know you know</i>
<i>how he hates to hunt.</i>

10:13.646 --> 10:15.013
<i>He hates it.</i>

10:15.047 --> 10:18.116
<i>He only does it to get a chance</i>
<i>to spend time with you.</i>

10:18.150 --> 10:20.785
<i>Make sure he knows</i>
<i>he doesn't have to</i>

10:20.803 --> 10:22.303
<i>gum up his boots to know</i>
<i>he has my support.</i>

10:22.338 --> 10:23.571
Let's see who else is there.

10:23.606 --> 10:24.989
There's another phone
signal I can pull up.

10:26.525 --> 10:29.360
<i>Still likes to golf, right?</i>

10:29.395 --> 10:31.329
<i>We oughta get him out</i>
<i>to Andrews more often.</i>

10:31.363 --> 10:33.314
- Shut it down. - <i>'Course
it ain't much to speak of,</i>

10:33.349 --> 10:34.266
<i>but I'm sure</i>
<i>the man could use a...</i>

10:34.299 --> 10:35.399
- Huck.

10:35.400 --> 10:37.135
<i>Long, frustrating walk to ease</i>
<i>his mind from time to time.</i>

10:37.169 --> 10:37.769
- Huck.

10:37.770 --> 10:39.370
I'm trying.

10:39.605 --> 10:40.571
What just happened?

10:41.974 --> 10:43.941
Wh-where'd it go?

10:43.975 --> 10:46.761
It self-destructed.
I can't bring it back up.

10:46.795 --> 10:48.880
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Come on.
Did you try the...

10:48.914 --> 10:50.714
It's dead. Okay,
if we want to see it again,

10:50.732 --> 10:52.432
I have to hack into
the N.S.A.'s firewall.

10:52.484 --> 10:53.467
How long would that take?

10:53.902 --> 10:55.169
Um... 22 days.

10:55.220 --> 10:56.353
22 days?!

10:56.387 --> 10:57.437
Artie, who else knows about this?

10:57.472 --> 10:58.939
I didn't tell anyone.
How could I?

10:58.973 --> 11:00.407
Well, then we're done here,
Artie. I can't help you.

11:00.458 --> 11:01.642
Wait. You said you were
gonna protect me.

11:01.676 --> 11:02.860
How can I?
Without Thorngate,

11:02.894 --> 11:04.161
you have no leverage,
nothing to bargain with.

11:04.195 --> 11:05.846
So tell me who else knows.

11:07.398 --> 11:09.866
Her name's Monica Ocampo.
She was on the development team.

11:09.901 --> 11:11.518
- Does she have access?
- Yes, but please,

11:11.552 --> 11:12.652
I don't want her to
come in any danger.

11:12.653 --> 11:13.437
She's a good person.

11:13.671 --> 11:14.654
Find her.

11:18.509 --> 11:19.559
Should I help?

11:19.593 --> 11:21.210
We're good.
Thanks, Lindsay.

11:32.622 --> 11:34.624
Bad optics for a senator
to be caught loitering.

11:34.642 --> 11:36.025
- Would you agree?
- Sorry I'm late.

11:36.060 --> 11:37.460
Enjoyed having you
in my ear last night.

11:38.095 --> 11:39.245
Tell me about Thorngate.

11:39.279 --> 11:40.880
Thorngate?

11:40.931 --> 11:42.014
You're on the senate
intelligence committee, Edison.

11:42.065 --> 11:43.432
Don't play dumb.

11:43.467 --> 11:44.800
And here I was
gonna ask you out.

11:44.835 --> 11:46.102
I got two tickets
to the National Ballet...

11:46.136 --> 11:48.170
Thorngate. I need to know
if I go public with this,

11:48.205 --> 11:49.922
whether you'll back me up,
verify its existence.

11:49.956 --> 11:52.408
- Olivia. - Our government
is spying on Americans.

11:52.426 --> 11:55.460
- Allegedly. - And your committee's
responsible for oversight.

11:55.461 --> 11:56.745
You took an oath to...

11:56.779 --> 11:58.797
My clearance level
is top secret.

11:58.831 --> 12:00.165
I took an oath to do
the exact opposite

12:00.216 --> 12:02.050
of what you're asking me to do.

12:02.068 --> 12:05.136
You always did
put your career above all.

12:05.171 --> 12:07.305
Takes one to know one.

12:09.458 --> 12:11.726
Liv. I don't know what
you're getting yourself into,

12:11.761 --> 12:14.212
but you don't want to
play games with the N.S.A.

12:14.246 --> 12:17.198
Their ball, their bat, their rules.

12:28.460 --> 12:30.728
- I'll take the lead on this one.
- Who made you boss?

12:30.762 --> 12:32.763
That tone... it's bad-cop tone.
It's ineffective.

12:32.814 --> 12:33.764
And since we're on the subject,
the way you've been

12:33.815 --> 12:35.316
badgering that kid,
pouncing on her...

12:35.350 --> 12:37.184
Lindsay Perkins is
a lying sociopath.

12:37.202 --> 12:38.319
Bad cop.

12:38.353 --> 12:40.654
You think I can't be good cop?

12:40.672 --> 12:42.340
Ha.
Oh, I can be good cop.

12:42.374 --> 12:45.592
Hell, I can be the sweet cop.

12:48.596 --> 12:51.934
Someone stole a little
something from the N.S.A.

12:53.768 --> 12:55.602
They think they may have
themselves a whistle-blower.

12:55.637 --> 12:56.653
Concerning what?

12:56.688 --> 12:57.589
Thorngate.

12:59.123 --> 13:00.524
Are we on top of this?

13:00.558 --> 13:01.692
There's a problem.

13:01.743 --> 13:02.959
There's always a problem.

13:03.011 --> 13:06.113
He's got himself some
interesting representation.

13:11.336 --> 13:13.870
Are we sure? This doesn't sound
like Liv's neighborhood.

13:13.905 --> 13:16.523
She's nosing around senators
on the intel committee.

13:26.366 --> 13:27.767
Senator Davis.

13:27.801 --> 13:29.001
Sir, Davis and Olivia...

13:29.036 --> 13:31.637
I don't need a history lesson.

13:43.467 --> 13:46.068
- Sir...
- I want this handled.

13:47.119 --> 13:48.386
I want the screws tightened
on this, Cy,

13:48.420 --> 13:49.687
and I want it done yesterday.

13:49.722 --> 13:52.824
You're ticking, sir.

13:52.858 --> 13:54.509
- What?
- You're ticking.

13:54.560 --> 13:56.594
You know how
I know you're ticking?

13:56.629 --> 13:58.413
Up until you saw this picture,
you've been happy.

13:58.464 --> 13:59.714
Lately, you've been happy.

13:59.765 --> 14:01.265
Don't get me wrong,
I've enjoyed it,

14:01.283 --> 14:03.718
not because of the happiness,
but because...

14:03.752 --> 14:05.620
It's been weird, like seeing
a grandma in a bikini

14:05.654 --> 14:07.472
or a democrat with a Bible.

14:07.506 --> 14:09.474
You're happy, but we both know

14:09.508 --> 14:11.326
that happy people are
rarely actually happy,

14:11.360 --> 14:14.078
unless they're morons.

14:14.113 --> 14:18.716
You are a brilliant man,
a Rhodes Scholar, and a PhD,

14:18.750 --> 14:19.883
which means
you're acting happy,

14:19.902 --> 14:21.435
because she won't take your calls,

14:21.487 --> 14:23.237
and you won't admit
that it bothers you

14:23.272 --> 14:25.072
and God knows what else that goes on

14:25.107 --> 14:28.659
with the Shakespearean drama
that is the women in your life.

14:28.693 --> 14:31.261
You're ticking, sir. You're a
bomb stuffed in a Teddy bear,

14:31.262 --> 14:32.663
waiting to explode.

14:32.697 --> 14:34.047
Tick.

14:34.082 --> 14:35.148
Tick.

14:35.183 --> 14:36.450
Tick.

14:36.484 --> 14:37.451
Tick.

14:37.485 --> 14:38.535
Stop it.

14:38.570 --> 14:40.604
How do I defuse the bomb, sir?

14:50.715 --> 14:52.432
Hello, sir.
Good evening.

14:52.466 --> 14:54.350
That remains to be seen, ma'am.

14:54.485 --> 14:57.069
You are so funny.

14:57.121 --> 14:59.505
Monica said he was funny.
Didn't she, Howard?

14:59.539 --> 15:00.306
Sure did.

15:00.357 --> 15:01.741
Anyhow, we just need the key.

15:01.775 --> 15:02.842
The key?

15:02.876 --> 15:04.427
To Monica's.
The surprise party?

15:12.953 --> 15:14.503
All I'm saying,
that wasn't good cop.

15:14.538 --> 15:15.737
That was some weird,
off-her-medications,

15:15.755 --> 15:17.089
emotionally unstable cop.

15:17.140 --> 15:20.109
Face it. I am a good cop,
you're a sore loser, and...

15:25.782 --> 15:28.000
Hello? Monica?

15:30.387 --> 15:32.171
You seeing what I'm seeing?

15:32.222 --> 15:33.606
Sleeping pills,
hastily written note...

15:33.640 --> 15:34.673
Classically staged suicide.

15:34.708 --> 15:35.791
No. Outside.

15:38.678 --> 15:39.895
Black sedan.

15:47.303 --> 15:49.321
Maybe Artie isn't
paranoid enough.

16:02.436 --> 16:04.453
I'll be there as soon as I can.

16:04.488 --> 16:06.372
Abby, see if you can
expedite Monica's autopsy.

16:06.406 --> 16:08.007
I want proof it wasn't a suicide.

16:08.041 --> 16:09.775
Tell Harrison to take the
partial license plate number

16:09.810 --> 16:11.010
and see where it goes.

16:11.044 --> 16:12.378
Pinning this murder
on the N.S.A. is

16:12.429 --> 16:15.531
how we corroborate
Artie's story.

16:15.549 --> 16:17.416
I'm on my way.

16:23.423 --> 16:26.342
Tom. Hal.

16:30.313 --> 16:31.614
Not bad, huh?

16:31.648 --> 16:34.100
Actually, fairly pathetic,
Mr. President.

16:34.134 --> 16:36.736
You talk a good game, Fitzy,

16:36.787 --> 16:37.903
but you couldn't hit
the side of a barn

16:37.938 --> 16:40.589
from the inside of a barn.
I swear.

16:40.607 --> 16:42.792
Doesn't look like I'll be
having duck for dinner.

16:42.826 --> 16:45.661
That's for sure.

16:45.695 --> 16:48.830
Okay, let's get ourselves
some coffee back at the lodge

16:48.864 --> 16:51.466
and give the President
a little time on his own.

16:52.184 --> 16:53.333
Time on my own?
What am I gonna do with that?

16:53.352 --> 16:55.436
To commune with nature, sir.

16:55.470 --> 16:57.488
I know how you enjoy that.

17:01.360 --> 17:04.679
Yeah, I'll see you guys in a bit.

17:04.713 --> 17:05.880
Where is she?

17:05.914 --> 17:08.249
Get out of the car.

17:08.282 --> 17:09.250
No.

17:09.284 --> 17:10.451
Get out of the car.

17:10.484 --> 17:11.801
No, and I don't appreciate
being summoned.

17:11.837 --> 17:14.320
- Get out of the car.
-Why? So you can shoot me?

17:14.339 --> 17:17.040
Get of out of the damn car, Olivia!

17:25.983 --> 17:28.134
Yeah, but Quinn's motive
was clear as day.

17:28.169 --> 17:29.736
Yeah, in the micro-sense,
you're right.

17:29.770 --> 17:30.954
Wait. Don't you have
to go to work?

17:30.988 --> 17:32.455
I called in sick again.
Lucky for us,

17:32.490 --> 17:34.240
Jane's a hypochondriac
and a bit of a racist,

17:34.258 --> 17:36.793
so when I say "cold,"
she hears "S A.R.S."

17:36.827 --> 17:38.178
Ah. You can
use that all winter.

17:38.212 --> 17:40.613
Anyway, that's why I focused
so heavily on the voice mail.

17:40.647 --> 17:41.931
That was a mistake.

17:41.966 --> 17:43.466
Wait. The voice mail where
Quinn viciously swore

17:43.501 --> 17:45.919
to gut him like a fish?
How is <i>that</i> a mistake?

17:45.953 --> 17:47.804
I'm saying, forget about all
that evidence, step back,

17:47.838 --> 17:50.306
what's the one thing we
know about Olivia Pope?

17:50.357 --> 17:52.692
Well, she's well-dressed,
she's a workaholic...

17:53.526 --> 17:55.627
Olivia Pope doesn't use
her magic for evil,

17:55.662 --> 17:57.012
she uses it for good.

17:57.063 --> 17:58.647
Olivia Pope doesn't move
heaven and earth

17:58.681 --> 18:00.749
and further corrupt
the justice system

18:00.800 --> 18:01.884
unless she knows
at the end of the day,

18:01.935 --> 18:04.119
she can put on the white hat
and ride out of town.

18:04.154 --> 18:07.539
Yes, but all the evidence
still points to Quinn Perkins.

18:07.574 --> 18:08.524
We're not talking about evidence.

18:08.558 --> 18:09.641
We're just talking about motive.

18:09.676 --> 18:11.276
Well, she had that, too.
She wanted revenge.

18:11.310 --> 18:14.396
Maybe the motive is bigger than
the revenge of a jilted lover.

18:14.447 --> 18:16.081
Maybe someone else
wanted Quinn's boyfriend

18:16.116 --> 18:18.817
and six other
Cytron employees dead?

18:28.076 --> 18:29.994
Tom and hal could've told me
where they were taking me.

18:30.028 --> 18:31.329
I could've dressed for it.

18:31.363 --> 18:32.413
Shut up.

19:14.972 --> 19:17.090
Where are we going?

19:17.124 --> 19:19.192
We are hunting.

19:19.226 --> 19:20.476
Do I get a gun?

19:20.494 --> 19:21.511
I'm not giving you a gun.

19:21.545 --> 19:22.878
That doesn't seem fair.

19:22.897 --> 19:24.213
Life isn't fair.

19:24.231 --> 19:25.732
What is your problem?

19:25.766 --> 19:27.066
What is my...

19:27.101 --> 19:28.568
I don't have a problem.

19:28.619 --> 19:30.519
Then why are secret service
agents physically removing me

19:30.537 --> 19:32.021
from my home
at 5:00 in the morning?

19:32.039 --> 19:33.673
Because they do what I say.

19:33.707 --> 19:35.175
I don't do what you say.

19:35.176 --> 19:36.425
Why are you helping
Artie Hornbacher?

19:36.426 --> 19:37.993
And I don't discuss
my clients with you.

19:38.111 --> 19:39.612
You don't discuss anything
with me anymore.

19:39.663 --> 19:41.163
Are you angry that I haven't
been taking your phone calls

19:41.198 --> 19:42.615
or because I'm helping
Artie Hornbacher?

19:42.666 --> 19:44.717
I an angry because you
are committing treason.

19:44.751 --> 19:46.969
I am angry that you're behaving
like a traitor to your country.

19:47.003 --> 19:48.136
To my country or to you?

19:48.154 --> 19:49.605
Oh, come on.
This isn't personal.

19:49.639 --> 19:51.607
I'm standing in the middle of
the forest in God knows where,

19:51.625 --> 19:53.292
so you can yell at me?
That feels personal.

19:53.326 --> 19:54.793
I do not care how it feels.

19:54.828 --> 19:56.595
You're harboring a fugitive.
It's criminal behavior.

19:56.630 --> 19:59.064
You and I both well know
what Thorngate is,

19:59.099 --> 20:00.850
what Thorngate does, and who
you are going to use it on.

20:00.884 --> 20:02.401
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

20:02.435 --> 20:03.986
You're using it
to spy on Americans.

20:04.020 --> 20:06.088
What we use it for is
highly classified,

20:06.122 --> 20:06.907
and it involves anti terrorism.

20:06.940 --> 20:08.040
They know about
the late-night phone calls.

20:08.041 --> 20:10.059
They know those calls
came from the white house.

20:14.781 --> 20:16.665
Where are you getting this?

20:16.700 --> 20:17.900
Your little
whistle-blower Artie,

20:17.934 --> 20:20.119
the guy who stole Thorngate
from the N.S.A.?

20:21.070 --> 20:22.470
I am pretty sure
the supreme court would consider

20:22.505 --> 20:25.473
this administration spying on
its citizens criminal behavior.

20:25.508 --> 20:27.075
I am protecting my country.

20:27.109 --> 20:29.711
You are dabbling
in national security issues.

20:29.745 --> 20:31.329
You're upsetting
the C.I.A.and N.S.A.,

20:31.363 --> 20:32.997
my guys at the state department,

20:33.032 --> 20:34.616
and you're using old boyfriends

20:34.650 --> 20:36.634
to dig up secrets on the
intelligence committee.

20:36.669 --> 20:37.986
I am not...

20:38.020 --> 20:41.539
Senator Davis was your
boyfriend from 2002 to 2006.

20:42.773 --> 20:44.007
You live together in Georgetown
and then New York.

20:44.042 --> 20:44.959
You had an engagement ring.

20:45.393 --> 20:47.094
And you were seen
with him yesterday,

20:47.128 --> 20:48.279
looking fairly cozy,
from what I hear.

20:48.313 --> 20:50.247
You two screwing again?

20:50.282 --> 20:52.099
Is he everything
you ever dreamed?

20:52.117 --> 20:53.367
Stop walking.

20:53.401 --> 20:56.136
<i>Stop...</i> Walking!

21:40.146 --> 21:42.081
I am not yours.

21:43.400 --> 21:46.902
I don't show up places
because you want me.

21:46.936 --> 21:49.238
I am not yours.

21:49.272 --> 21:51.290
This is over.

22:07.773 --> 22:09.024
I can't say how long.
Everybody's different.

22:09.058 --> 22:10.559
It's just a toxicology report.

22:10.593 --> 22:12.227
It's just sending blood
to a lab, right?

22:12.261 --> 22:14.212
Monica Ocampo
may no longer be with us,

22:14.247 --> 22:16.831
but she's still with us,
still in my care.

22:16.866 --> 22:19.634
Monica's autopsy will take
as long as Monica needs.

22:19.652 --> 22:21.503
I expect that's a courtesy

22:21.537 --> 22:24.539
you'll want for yourself
someday, Red.

22:26.625 --> 22:29.026
Monica was the only friend
I had in that place,

22:29.061 --> 22:30.511
maybe the only friend
I had in this city.

22:30.545 --> 22:32.113
They did this to her.
I know they did.

22:32.147 --> 22:33.264
There was a black sedan
on the scene.

22:33.315 --> 22:34.331
Someone was watching.

22:34.366 --> 22:36.717
I told you.
They'll do anything.

22:36.735 --> 22:38.686
I need to get out of here.
Please! I'm begging you!

22:38.720 --> 22:40.921
Snap out of it, Artie!
It's the N.S.A.

22:40.956 --> 22:42.339
operating with the full backing

22:42.374 --> 22:43.874
of the white house
and justice department.

22:43.909 --> 22:45.126
They'll find you.

22:45.160 --> 22:47.178
The only way to stop them
is to take this public.

22:47.212 --> 22:50.014
The scary guy hasn't even
de-encrypted the program yet!

22:50.048 --> 22:51.248
Let us worry about that.

22:51.249 --> 22:53.099
You worry about getting ready
for prime time.

22:53.233 --> 22:54.467
Quinn, buy Artie a suit...

22:54.501 --> 22:56.503
Slim fit, single-breasted,
2-button, Navy.

22:56.537 --> 22:57.954
I want him to look polished,

22:58.005 --> 22:59.305
not one colander hat shy
of a crazy person.

22:59.339 --> 23:01.508
Huck, <i>can</i> you do this?
How long?

23:01.542 --> 23:02.559
24 hours?

23:02.610 --> 23:04.510
I think so. Maybe.

23:04.528 --> 23:06.146
My producer Jack Lynn.

23:06.180 --> 23:09.232
Hi, Jack. Sorry.
No recording devices.

23:09.266 --> 23:11.735
- We off the record here?
- For now. And I need you to agree

23:11.769 --> 23:13.870
on a 24-hour embargo on anything
we discuss here today.

23:13.921 --> 23:16.639
- We don't even know...
- My client's life is at stake.

23:16.690 --> 23:18.408
If you can't agree to
an embargo... I like you, Kim.

23:18.442 --> 23:20.226
I came to you first,
because I think you're the best,

23:20.261 --> 23:21.361
but you're not the only game
in town.

23:21.395 --> 23:23.263
- Are we talking exclusive?
- Exclusive.

23:23.897 --> 23:25.297
We agreed on the embargo?

23:27.534 --> 23:28.701
The United States government

23:28.735 --> 23:30.152
is using an N.S.A. program
called Thorngate

23:30.187 --> 23:32.438
to spy on millions of American
citizens in their homes,

23:32.472 --> 23:33.906
in their cars,
and their offices.

23:33.940 --> 23:35.808
♪ Don't force it,
let it happen naturally ♪

23:36.542 --> 23:37.626
How?

23:37.660 --> 23:39.077
Why do you have
so many old watches?

23:39.111 --> 23:41.713
Don't touch my stuff.
Damn it.

23:41.747 --> 23:43.715
What de-encryption program
are you running?

23:43.733 --> 23:45.851
I've created an
accelerated G.P.U. on linux

23:45.885 --> 23:48.120
breaking 28.6 billion
passwords per second.

23:48.154 --> 23:49.487
With only three computers?

23:49.505 --> 23:50.956
We're never gonna get through
the encryption in time.

23:50.990 --> 23:53.592
I sent out a root kit virus
to over 5,000 bot-net computers.

23:53.626 --> 23:55.777
The whole city is crunching
numbers for me. Relax.

23:55.828 --> 23:57.429
Relax?
You don't finish, I'm dead.

23:57.463 --> 23:58.897
Do you know the kind of
things they do to a man?

23:58.931 --> 24:00.949
I heard by the end that
you're begging them to kill you.

24:00.983 --> 24:02.751
Oh, is that so?

24:06.104 --> 24:07.738
- What's this?
- What you asked for...

24:07.756 --> 24:08.606
Every black Lincoln

24:08.640 --> 24:11.108
with the letters "R" and "B"
on the plate.

24:11.126 --> 24:12.226
How about a "thank you"?

24:12.260 --> 24:13.277
Thank you.

24:13.312 --> 24:14.412
How about a phone number?

24:14.446 --> 24:15.796
How did you come
across the information

24:15.831 --> 24:17.365
that Thorngate was being used...

24:18.216 --> 24:19.399
<i>Is</i> being used
this very second.

24:19.433 --> 24:20.984
You just interrupted Kimberly.

24:21.002 --> 24:22.302
You <i>never</i> interrupt Kimberly.

24:22.353 --> 24:24.004
Wait. This interview's
with Kimberly Mitchell?

24:24.055 --> 24:25.388
The seething mouthpiece
of the government's

24:25.423 --> 24:27.374
propaganda machine?
Why not just turn me in?

24:27.425 --> 24:28.542
Artie, take a breath.

24:28.576 --> 24:29.776
Keep your head still.
Maintain eye contact.

24:29.827 --> 24:31.261
Just answer
what was asked of you.

24:31.295 --> 24:32.612
If you go off on a tangent,
it'll look unreliable.

24:32.647 --> 24:33.630
Let's try again.

24:33.664 --> 24:34.815
How did you come across
the information

24:34.849 --> 24:36.899
that Thorngate is being used
on American citizens?

24:36.933 --> 24:37.784
This guy is set to reveal

24:37.818 --> 24:39.852
our most highly classified
spyware on prime time?

24:39.887 --> 24:41.487
What happened to
containing this thing?

24:41.522 --> 24:42.505
Olivia's trying an end-around.

24:42.539 --> 24:44.590
Right out
of the do-gooder playbook...

24:44.724 --> 24:47.459
Grandstanding, "the public has
a right to know" Kumbaya fest.

24:47.494 --> 24:49.395
Think about it this way...
How much of your audience

24:49.429 --> 24:52.097
watches you at home with
their cell phones or laptops on?

24:52.148 --> 24:53.482
I would imagine
almost everyone.

24:53.500 --> 24:56.051
Well, then everyone should be
very concerned about this.

24:56.069 --> 24:57.236
He's ready.

24:57.270 --> 24:58.487
My legal options.

24:58.521 --> 25:00.822
They run the gamut
from gag orders

25:00.840 --> 25:02.141
to subpoenas
to seizing everything

25:02.175 --> 25:04.126
to detaining
and prosecuting in secrecy.

25:04.160 --> 25:06.445
Under various statutes
under the espionage act,

25:06.479 --> 25:08.547
PATRIOT Act,
National Security Act.

25:08.581 --> 25:10.015
Just depends on how aggressive
you want to be.

25:10.750 --> 25:13.752
I want you to unleash
a legal Tsunami.

25:13.786 --> 25:16.771
Don't just empty both barrels.
We go nuclear on this.

25:16.789 --> 25:19.074
You've got it?

25:19.108 --> 25:22.077
Got it. Put up a beautiful
struggle, but I cracked it.

25:22.111 --> 25:25.180
Good work, huck.

25:25.647 --> 25:26.964
What's going on?

25:26.999 --> 25:28.599
The network just got slapped

25:28.634 --> 25:30.201
with an injunction
by the justice department.

25:30.285 --> 25:31.636
If we go forward
with the broadcast,

25:31.670 --> 25:33.071
we could all get arrested
for treason.

25:47.686 --> 25:50.388
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

25:51.322 --> 25:53.323
I was trying to write a thank-
you note to queen Elizabeth.

25:53.374 --> 25:55.258
Do you have any idea
how difficult it is

25:55.293 --> 25:57.076
to write a thank-you note
to the queen?

25:57.095 --> 25:58.728
I felt like some yahoo
from podunk.

25:58.763 --> 26:01.815
I was terrified of starting
an international incident.

26:01.833 --> 26:06.103
God, I'm starving. This baby
is eating all of my food.

26:06.154 --> 26:08.221
Is this the duck you shot?

26:08.256 --> 26:11.425
I hope Mickey got a good photo
to show to the press corps.

26:11.459 --> 26:12.859
Mmm!

26:12.894 --> 26:13.877
Mmm!

26:15.746 --> 26:17.096
How was your day?

26:19.416 --> 26:20.683
Honey?

26:20.718 --> 26:22.619
Where's kip?

26:22.653 --> 26:24.654
What?

26:24.705 --> 26:26.155
Kip Provenza and Mary.

26:26.207 --> 26:27.991
The commerce secretary
and his wife who won't shut up.

26:28.042 --> 26:29.309
I thought we were
having them over

26:29.343 --> 26:30.776
for dinner
in the residence tonight.

26:30.794 --> 26:32.629
Oh, I just thought...

26:32.663 --> 26:33.997
What?

26:34.048 --> 26:36.749
It'd be nice to have it be
just the two of us for once

26:36.783 --> 26:38.334
since...

26:38.385 --> 26:39.669
Since what?

26:46.160 --> 26:47.343
Nothing.

27:06.225 --> 27:07.375
I don't buy it.

27:07.409 --> 27:09.043
- Which part?
- The part where you think

27:09.078 --> 27:11.229
a jilted girlfriend would
never go on a killing spree.

27:11.247 --> 27:13.465
'Cause let me tell ya...
Bitches be crazy.

27:13.499 --> 27:14.883
Look at what Cytron does.

27:14.917 --> 27:16.484
They have contracts
with casinos,

27:16.519 --> 27:17.935
offshore betting sites...

27:18.553 --> 27:19.804
Two words... fugue state.

27:19.838 --> 27:21.655
Construction companies,
probably mob-owned.

27:21.690 --> 27:24.258
These guys at Cytron
swam with sketchy.

27:24.292 --> 27:26.127
I bet there's tons of people out
there who wanted to hurt them.

27:26.178 --> 27:27.745
Fugue state.

27:27.779 --> 27:29.296
This is bigger than
Quinn Perkins.

27:29.331 --> 27:30.731
It's bigger than Olivia Pope.

27:31.266 --> 27:33.634
It's a cover-up, Alissa,
and hard as it is to admit,

27:33.668 --> 27:35.602
we were wrong about
almost everything.

27:35.637 --> 27:38.138
Okay. Fine. Maybe Quinn
didn't murder those people,

27:38.172 --> 27:40.957
but she did do something,
and without a doubt,

27:40.991 --> 27:43.193
somebody over at camp Pope
and associates knows something.

27:46.964 --> 27:48.297
We argue this in court,
we go up against

27:48.331 --> 27:49.966
the full legal might
of the federal government.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.517
Armies of lawyers,
bottomless resources.

27:51.568 --> 27:53.436
Meanwhile, we're all
in jail and Artie...

27:53.470 --> 27:55.505
God know where they'd
rendition the poor guy.

27:57.491 --> 27:59.675
We fight this with the
network, not in court.

27:59.709 --> 28:01.160
We stiffen their backbone,
appeal to their patriotic duty.

28:01.195 --> 28:02.795
Freedom of the press,

28:02.846 --> 28:04.564
unconstitutional intrusion
of the right to privacy.

28:04.615 --> 28:06.332
A man's cell phone
<i>is</i> his castle.

28:06.366 --> 28:08.117
Meanwhile, we need
those autopsy results,

28:08.151 --> 28:09.986
and that partial plate
off the black sedan.

28:10.020 --> 28:11.237
Thorngate is real
and a monstrosity.

28:11.271 --> 28:13.723
They don't muzzle us so easily.

28:18.495 --> 28:20.947
Tom.
Hal.

28:21.581 --> 28:23.798
What happened to my husband?

28:23.817 --> 28:25.200
Ma'am?

28:25.335 --> 28:27.369
Who did he talk to? What put
Fitz in such a terrible mood?

28:27.403 --> 28:29.554
Because when he left me
to go hunting, he was smiling,

28:29.589 --> 28:31.139
and when he came home,
he wasn't.

28:31.174 --> 28:33.542
I'm sure we don't know, ma'am.

28:34.076 --> 28:37.529
You can't say.
I understand.

28:37.563 --> 28:40.515
So... I am just going
to say some things,

28:40.549 --> 28:44.669
and when I am correct,
I'd like one of you to blink.

28:44.703 --> 28:47.455
That's all. Just flutter
your eyelashes for a girl.

28:47.473 --> 28:49.841
Ma'am.
The President of France.

28:49.875 --> 28:51.176
East Sudan.

28:51.210 --> 28:53.228
Hollis Doyle.

28:53.262 --> 28:55.864
That guy on fox news.

28:55.898 --> 28:57.615
His mother.

28:57.650 --> 28:59.834
Cyrus?

28:59.885 --> 29:02.937
Olivia Pope.

29:16.935 --> 29:18.952
Have a lovely day, gentlemen.

29:22.090 --> 29:23.774
I didn't say a word.

29:24.508 --> 29:26.826
No way in hell
are we airing this interview.

29:26.860 --> 29:27.961
I'm against it,

29:28.095 --> 29:30.046
and to say that my friends here
from the legal department

29:30.080 --> 29:31.297
are against it, well,

29:31.315 --> 29:33.015
that's just an exercise
in understatement.

29:33.066 --> 29:34.567
The government will back off,
Brad. I promise.

29:34.601 --> 29:35.851
You promise?

29:35.886 --> 29:38.654
This isn't some two-seconds-
of-nipple F.C.C. Fine

29:38.705 --> 29:39.839
we're risking.

29:39.873 --> 29:41.090
It's a federal injunction

29:41.141 --> 29:42.975
essentially handed down
personally

29:43.010 --> 29:44.777
by the justice department,
saying,

29:44.811 --> 29:46.745
"if you air this interview,
you're guilty of treason."

29:46.763 --> 29:48.380
And I'm saying
call their bluff.

29:48.398 --> 29:50.416
Generate so much public outrage
on Artie Hornbacher's behalf,

29:50.450 --> 29:52.584
that if the N.S.A. so much
as gives him a speeding ticket,

29:52.603 --> 29:53.736
they'll stage a coup.

29:53.770 --> 29:55.371
Based on one man's word?

29:55.405 --> 29:57.508
No, based on this.

29:59.059 --> 30:00.576
Huck?

30:00.610 --> 30:03.645
Go ahead
and bring up Thorngate.

30:05.665 --> 30:07.516
Is this some kind of joke?

30:07.550 --> 30:09.768
That's your wife Julie,
isn't it?

30:09.786 --> 30:13.188
My home system is encrypted.
This should not be possible.

30:13.239 --> 30:14.806
You want audio?
Please.

30:15.424 --> 30:18.142
<i>Anyway, you know how it is</i>
<i>after a baby.</i>

30:18.160 --> 30:19.561
<i>You know, I try being all sexy,</i>

30:19.595 --> 30:21.479
<i>but I still don't feel</i>
<i>like myself,</i>

30:21.513 --> 30:24.132
<i>and, well, he could try</i>
<i>a little harder, too.</i>

30:24.166 --> 30:25.900
<i>Can't remember the last time</i>
<i>he went to the gym.</i>

30:26.035 --> 30:27.719
Turn it off.
There's also a link

30:27.753 --> 30:29.671
to all e-mail accounts
associated with this address

30:29.722 --> 30:32.189
and access to each computer
search history.

30:32.207 --> 30:32.990
Shall we take a look?

30:33.008 --> 30:34.375
I said, turn it off.

30:34.409 --> 30:34.927
Huck.

30:34.961 --> 30:37.128
Brad, I know this is compelling
stuff, but we need... Shut up.

30:45.337 --> 30:46.670
Do it.

30:52.310 --> 30:54.061
I did okay, I guess, in life.

30:54.095 --> 30:56.597
Saw the Grand Canyon,
had sex with a woman,

30:56.631 --> 30:58.415
I saw "The Empire Strikes Back"
in the theater.

30:58.449 --> 31:00.150
After the interview,
you'll be a hero.

31:00.185 --> 31:01.952
Not for long. I mean,
I might be okay for a while,

31:01.986 --> 31:03.303
but this story will die down
soon enough,

31:03.355 --> 31:05.055
and then I'll be
looking over my shoulder

31:05.073 --> 31:05.623
for the rest of my life.

31:06.057 --> 31:07.057
At least when you die,
you'll have done something,

31:07.058 --> 31:08.892
something noble.
More than most can say.

31:08.926 --> 31:10.026
Noble hero, huh?

31:10.061 --> 31:11.411
Never thought about it
that way.

31:14.215 --> 31:16.800
Oh.

31:27.945 --> 31:29.112
The network's in.

31:29.146 --> 31:30.446
Artie's sitting down
with Mitchell tonight.

31:30.464 --> 31:31.581
She's willing to come to us,

31:31.615 --> 31:32.665
so coordinate with
their production team.

31:32.700 --> 31:34.050
We want to keep it
small and safe.

31:34.084 --> 31:35.785
Two camera ops at most,
one sound guy. Abby, what?

31:35.819 --> 31:37.920
Coroner finally got to
the autopsy report

31:37.954 --> 31:40.139
on Monica Ocampo. It wasn't
sleeping pills that killed her.

31:40.173 --> 31:43.492
- What was it? - She OD'd on 1,600
units of injectable Insulin.

31:45.779 --> 31:48.364
Harrison, where are we
with the plate match?

31:48.398 --> 31:50.632
Quinn and I have cross-referenced
the entire D.M.V. list.

31:50.650 --> 31:52.334
The car doesn't track back
to anyone at the N.S.A.

31:52.368 --> 31:53.735
or government for that
matter, but get this...

31:53.770 --> 31:55.137
It's registered
to a fake address

31:55.171 --> 31:57.589
under the name
of "Will B.Watching."

31:57.624 --> 31:59.641
Will B.Watching?
Is that some kind of joke?

32:02.945 --> 32:04.796
Huck, where's Artie?

32:04.831 --> 32:05.881
He's in the bathroom again.

32:05.899 --> 32:07.182
Break down the door.

32:07.216 --> 32:09.251
- What?
- <i>Break down the door!</i>

32:12.655 --> 32:13.872
Come on. Come on.
Come on.

32:13.923 --> 32:15.707
<i>He's also lactose intolerant,</i>

32:15.742 --> 32:17.142
<i>allergic to grass, honey,</i>
<i>strawberries, peanuts,</i>

32:17.176 --> 32:18.544
<i>is a type 1 diabetic...</i>

32:18.578 --> 32:20.596
<i>Believes that vaccines</i>
<i>are demonic.</i>

32:22.899 --> 32:24.366
Come on.

32:32.275 --> 32:33.692
Come on.

32:33.743 --> 32:35.077
<i>There was a black sedan</i>
<i>on the scene.</i>

32:35.111 --> 32:37.162
<i>Someone was watching.</i>
<i>I need to get out of here.</i>

32:41.016 --> 32:42.883
Got it. Let's go.

33:04.261 --> 33:05.561
How did this happen?

33:05.896 --> 33:07.446
He must've known. He must've
done his homework on us.

33:07.481 --> 33:10.082
Come on! You know
how this happened.

33:10.117 --> 33:11.984
Artie couldn't decrypt
Thorngate himself,

33:12.118 --> 33:13.435
so he found the one person
who could.

33:13.470 --> 33:14.536
Then he killed poor Monica,

33:14.571 --> 33:16.021
made it look like he
was being followed,

33:16.089 --> 33:18.424
all so that we'd help him buy
time and get what he needed.

33:18.458 --> 33:21.460
But as for why this happened?
You'd have to ask Olivia that,

33:21.494 --> 33:24.246
and that would be a waste of
time because she's off her game.

33:25.097 --> 33:27.482
Her gut is broken, and we have
no idea what she's thinking.

33:27.516 --> 33:28.483
What's going on with her?

33:28.517 --> 33:30.401
It was a mistake,

33:30.419 --> 33:32.003
and the first one I've seen
her make since I got here,

33:32.037 --> 33:33.104
so give her a break.

33:33.139 --> 33:34.305
- Second.
- What?

33:34.340 --> 33:35.490
Second mistake she's made.

33:39.561 --> 33:41.262
Bad cop.

33:48.670 --> 33:51.305
I tried everywhere.
I called everyone.

33:51.339 --> 33:53.290
I hacked into
the face recognition software

33:53.325 --> 33:55.226
used by capitol police.

33:55.260 --> 33:57.428
I checked every traffic
camera in the Tri-state area.

33:57.462 --> 33:59.680
- All dead ends.
- This isn't on you, huck.

33:59.714 --> 34:02.382
This is on me. This is my mistake.
I made the wrong call.

34:02.617 --> 34:04.184
Incoming!

34:10.291 --> 34:12.275
- Where is he?
- Who?

34:12.909 --> 34:14.594
Don't get cute.
You're in enough trouble.

34:14.628 --> 34:16.462
Harboring a fugitive,
obstructing justice,

34:16.496 --> 34:18.214
theft of classified intelligence.

34:18.232 --> 34:20.065
I'm so confused.
What are we talking about?

34:20.199 --> 34:22.534
The tv interview was canceled,
which means you lost him,

34:22.569 --> 34:24.402
which means, assuming
that Artie Hornbacher

34:24.437 --> 34:25.938
got his hands on Thorngate,

34:25.972 --> 34:27.106
our greatest weapon
in the war on terror

34:27.139 --> 34:28.974
is out to the highest
bidder as we speak.

34:29.025 --> 34:30.242
That's your problem.

34:30.393 --> 34:32.344
- Excuse me?
- Artie Hornbacher played us.

34:32.478 --> 34:34.362
For two days, he wagged our dog.
I'm not proud of that.

34:34.380 --> 34:36.197
But he played you for 16 years.

34:36.232 --> 34:38.100
Who knows what other secrets
he stole along the way,

34:38.134 --> 34:40.351
right out from under your nose.
What a great story...

34:41.085 --> 34:42.786
The kind of story that leads
to congressional hearings

34:42.821 --> 34:44.455
and mass firings
and books and movies.

34:44.489 --> 34:46.306
Juicy stuff.

34:47.643 --> 34:48.743
What do you want?

34:48.777 --> 34:50.712
12 hours to find and deliver Artie.

34:50.746 --> 34:52.080
Then we call it even.

35:02.057 --> 35:03.724
I'll give you till noon tomorrow.

35:03.959 --> 35:05.559
If I don't hear from you,
I'll be detaining your entire team

35:05.594 --> 35:08.128
for questioning, indefinitely.

35:16.220 --> 35:18.889
I want Senator Davis
off the Intel committee.

35:21.808 --> 35:22.892
Sir...

35:22.927 --> 35:24.210
I want him off.

35:30.568 --> 35:35.021
Many a man has been
undone by jealousy.

35:35.239 --> 35:37.390
How did you know she
wasn't taking my calls?

35:37.524 --> 35:39.041
What?

35:39.692 --> 35:42.544
Earlier you said Liv
wasn't taking my calls.

35:42.579 --> 35:44.129
How did you know?

35:59.146 --> 36:02.164
Well, at least we know
Thorngate really works.

36:02.899 --> 36:05.500
Just keeping America safe

36:05.535 --> 36:06.968
from the terrorists, sir.

36:07.036 --> 36:09.070
Liv's not a terrorist.

36:11.074 --> 36:13.575
I wasn't talking about her.

36:14.610 --> 36:17.178
She's not ticking. You are.

36:23.952 --> 36:25.553
I will have Senator Davis

36:25.587 --> 36:27.572
removed from the intel committee.

36:37.666 --> 36:39.684
You want something?

36:40.618 --> 36:42.102
I need to make some plans.

36:42.353 --> 36:44.070
What?

36:44.321 --> 36:46.623
For my future,
after your first term is done,

36:46.657 --> 36:48.007
because you're never gonna
make it to a second term.

36:48.042 --> 36:49.208
Clearly, you're
a once-around-the-ballroom

36:49.243 --> 36:50.593
kind of President.

36:50.628 --> 36:52.128
Mellie, I don't know
what you're talking about.

36:52.162 --> 36:54.147
Olivia Pope.

36:54.181 --> 36:56.182
I am talking about Olivia Pope.

36:56.216 --> 36:58.084
You took her hunting?

36:58.118 --> 37:00.169
Really, honey?

37:00.587 --> 37:02.355
She could be facing
federal prison.

37:02.389 --> 37:04.290
But you needed to spend a few
minutes with your girlfriend.

37:04.341 --> 37:06.108
That's...

37:06.143 --> 37:08.160
It's sweet...

37:08.195 --> 37:10.262
If it didn't mean the end
of your political career,

37:10.297 --> 37:12.248
because you won't make it
to a second term.

37:12.282 --> 37:16.736
I will make sure of it, because
I need to make some plans

37:16.770 --> 37:19.405
for my political future.

37:19.456 --> 37:24.392
And I do have a bright,
bright political future.

37:24.527 --> 37:27.011
The sweet lawyer who gave up
her career for her husband,

37:27.046 --> 37:28.413
suffered a miscarriage,

37:28.464 --> 37:31.066
then had a late-in-life baby
while first lady...

37:31.100 --> 37:33.351
That's <i>gold.</i>

37:33.402 --> 37:35.603
That's a future President.

37:35.621 --> 37:36.821
That's a hell of a second act,

37:36.856 --> 37:39.357
and America loves a second act.

37:39.392 --> 37:40.408
Mellie.

37:40.443 --> 37:42.560
- Get over her.
- Mellie.

37:42.595 --> 37:44.145
Get over her!

37:54.506 --> 37:57.775
You see her again,
I'll blow you away.

37:59.461 --> 38:02.029
And I'm an excellent shot.
Remember?

38:31.709 --> 38:33.559
Hello, Artie.

38:35.345 --> 38:37.046
Nice watch.

38:37.080 --> 38:39.699
Oh. Hey.

38:40.833 --> 38:42.935
Yeah, I just...
I just borrowed it.

38:47.874 --> 38:50.559
You got back in, cracked
Thorngate a second time.

38:50.610 --> 38:52.210
No small feat.

38:53.429 --> 38:55.881
I didn't need Thorngate to find you.

38:55.915 --> 38:57.683
The watch is old,
and it has radium in it,

38:57.717 --> 39:00.719
which is bad for you
and very easy to track.

39:00.753 --> 39:03.388
I warned you not to touch
my stuff, didn't I, Artie?

39:03.923 --> 39:06.391
We can split the money.
All right?

39:06.425 --> 39:08.476
You'd never have to work again.

39:08.511 --> 39:11.045
Oh, I like my work.

39:15.367 --> 39:17.185
Oh! Oh.

39:19.371 --> 39:22.006
Ohh.

39:30.164 --> 39:32.416
Tranquilizer should wear off
in a few minutes.

39:32.450 --> 39:34.785
We'll talk more then.

39:37.588 --> 39:40.190
Where's huck?

39:40.224 --> 39:41.891
I don't know, but we should
be buying him a drink.

39:41.909 --> 39:43.543
He saved our asses.

39:43.578 --> 39:45.595
Gotta admit, Artie was good.

39:46.130 --> 39:48.681
Every little detail
was played to perfection...

39:48.716 --> 39:50.967
The neuroses, the paranoia,
even the allergies.

39:51.001 --> 39:53.702
The man had hives on his neck.
I saw them.

39:53.720 --> 39:56.455
He was a lying mastermind.

39:56.507 --> 39:58.475
Takes one to know one,
<i>Lindsay.</i>

39:59.693 --> 40:00.694
Screw you.

40:01.428 --> 40:02.628
Excuse me?

40:02.663 --> 40:03.830
Oh, you didn't hear me?

40:04.464 --> 40:06.131
Go screw yourself.

40:06.166 --> 40:07.666
And when you're done with that,

40:07.717 --> 40:09.535
you can go straight to hell
and screw yourself there,

40:09.569 --> 40:10.836
'cause I don't want
to hear it anymore.

40:10.887 --> 40:12.271
I'm not a murderer
and I'm not a liar,

40:12.405 --> 40:13.839
and I'm not going anywhere.

40:13.890 --> 40:15.491
So the sooner you get
over it, the better.

40:15.525 --> 40:19.394
And I go by one name now,
and it's not <i>Lindsay.</i>

40:19.428 --> 40:21.680

40:21.731 --> 40:23.498
Ah.

40:23.533 --> 40:25.434
I'm Quinn, bitch.

40:28.404 --> 40:30.389
Ah!

40:32.642 --> 40:33.608
Buy me a drink?

40:35.311 --> 40:37.262
That's your line?
"Buy me a drink"?

40:37.296 --> 40:39.396
I'm unemployed. Come on.
One charity drink.

40:39.531 --> 40:40.181
You can write it off.

40:40.199 --> 40:42.717
I'm a good cause.
Hey. Uh, a Manhattan, please.

40:48.924 --> 40:50.891

41:00.435 --> 41:02.736
Was it you
who taught him to hunt?

41:02.770 --> 41:04.638
Didn't mean to sneak up on you.

41:04.673 --> 41:06.156
What are you doing here?

41:06.191 --> 41:08.576
You didn't hear?
I'm a client now.

41:08.610 --> 41:09.943
And how's that?

41:09.961 --> 41:11.745
Because the President
of the United States

41:11.779 --> 41:13.797
had me kicked off the senate
intelligence committee

41:13.832 --> 41:15.132
and is having my behavior

41:15.166 --> 41:17.251
"looked into"
by the ethics committee.

41:17.285 --> 41:19.253
And to my thinking,
it's because

41:19.287 --> 41:21.672
I was reckless enough
to talk to you.

41:21.723 --> 41:25.309
So... now I'm your client.

41:25.343 --> 41:26.644
Pro bono.

41:26.678 --> 41:29.129
Unless you have
a conflict of interest.

41:29.147 --> 41:32.266
You're not still tied to
the white house, are you?

41:32.300 --> 41:34.969
No. No ties.

41:43.811 --> 41:45.195
Hey.

41:45.247 --> 41:47.197
No more walking alone
to your car.

41:47.249 --> 41:49.483
Huck, you didn't...

41:49.501 --> 41:51.785
I didn't hurt him... much.

41:51.819 --> 41:53.504
Anyway, they have him now.

41:53.538 --> 41:56.373
Huck, if I opened a door
that you can't close...

41:56.424 --> 41:57.508
Doors are closed.

41:57.542 --> 41:59.860
I'm okay. I am.

41:59.894 --> 42:02.846
You don't worry about me.
I'm handling it.

42:07.852 --> 42:09.536
Thank you.

42:09.571 --> 42:12.673
No, thank you.

42:16.127 --> 42:17.377
Want a ride?

42:17.411 --> 42:19.296
Sure.

Huh.

Yeah.
