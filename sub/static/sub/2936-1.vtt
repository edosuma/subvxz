23:25.437 --> 23:27.770
You order beer or lemonade

23:27.979 --> 23:30.270
No one's serious at seventeen

23:30.437 --> 23:32.853

the intoxication of nature

23:41.354 --> 23:45.103

and lose your inhibitions.

23:45.354 --> 23:49.770

23:49.896 --> 23:52.103

23:52.229 --> 23:54.853
and tell everyone
how you fell in love

23:55.021 --> 23:56.561
and what a great summer you had.

23:56.729 --> 23:58.561
His beloved makes him a man.

23:58.854 --> 24:01.436
It's about becoming an adult.

24:01.604 --> 24:04.228

24:04.396 --> 24:06.561
being carefree, having freedom...

24:06.729 --> 24:08.020
happiness and joy.

24:08.646 --> 24:11.436
There's a neologism

24:11.687 --> 24:13.978
A reference to Robinson Crusoe.

but ultimately you're alone.

24:18.354 --> 24:19.561

by an unbroken circle,

24:23.562 --> 24:25.728

It's not just a poem
about meeting someone.

25:04.521 --> 25:05.520

to see if she's acting
on her own free will

47:46.437 --> 47:48.353
or with a pimp.

47:56.687 --> 48:01.353
Children can access internet porn.
They get ideas.

48:01.562 --> 48:03.186
Unless you use parental controls.

48:03.812 --> 48:06.645
Ever check her phone messages?

48:06.812 --> 48:07.811
No.

48:07.896 --> 48:10.353
OFFICER: Did you know about this?

48:22.937 --> 48:24.270
Did you know?

48:24.854 --> 48:25.853
No.

48:37.854 --> 48:39.853
- CLAIRE: Coming to Ben's party?
- Don't know.

48:40.229 --> 48:43.186
His parents are gone,
it's gonna be good.

48:43.604 --> 48:44.853
Yeah, maybe.

48:45.021 --> 48:46.603
Etienne will be there.

48:46.771 --> 48:49.145
Good time for me to make a move.

48:49.229 --> 48:50.228
Yeah.

48:50.479 --> 48:51.853
You can bring your guy.

48:51.937 --> 48:53.353
That's over.

48:54.062 --> 48:55.061
Shit!

48:55.271 --> 48:56.270
Are you sad?

48:56.479 --> 48:59.103
It's for the best.
Too much age difference.

49:01.687 --> 49:02.686
Leaving already?

49:02.854 --> 49:04.061
Yes. Your mother's home.

49:04.187 --> 49:05.228
What's up?

49:05.312 --> 49:06.853
It's not my business.

49:09.187 --> 49:10.228
What's with her?

49:10.396 --> 49:11.436
Don't know.

49:12.604 --> 49:13.728
See you tomorrow.

49:22.937 --> 49:24.353
Home already?

49:24.646 --> 49:26.811
Your sister and I need to talk.

49:29.062 --> 49:30.478
Come here, please.

49:41.854 --> 49:43.103
I know everything.

49:44.729 --> 49:46.020
About Lea.

49:47.562 --> 49:48.978
Stay put.

49:50.562 --> 49:51.936
The police came.

49:52.271 --> 49:53.936
Why didn't you tell me?

49:55.229 --> 49:56.228
Tell you what?

49:56.396 --> 49:57.478
Tell me what?

49:57.687 --> 49:59.061
What you're doing!

49:59.396 --> 50:00.811
Whoring!

50:00.896 --> 50:02.061
Whoring?

50:02.229 --> 50:03.478
Think it's funny?

50:06.437 --> 50:09.228
That man died, do you realise?

50:09.812 --> 50:11.228
Do you realise?

50:12.021 --> 50:13.061
(SOBBING) You sicken me!

50:13.729 --> 50:16.728
- Do you know how bad you've hurt me?
- (SCREAMING)

50:17.812 --> 50:19.186
Do you know?

50:19.354 --> 50:21.061
What's wrong with you?

50:21.479 --> 50:22.811
Have you gone crazy?

50:22.979 --> 50:24.145
Why'd you do it?

50:24.312 --> 50:26.478
You've broken my heart!

50:43.854 --> 50:45.186
Isabelle...

50:46.104 --> 50:47.145
Please.

50:47.812 --> 50:48.811
Isabelle.

50:52.354 --> 50:53.561
Forgive me.

50:53.937 --> 50:55.103
I'm sorry.

50:59.312 --> 51:00.561
What happened?

51:01.479 --> 51:03.561
(BOTH SOBBING)

51:06.104 --> 51:07.311
My baby!

51:15.146 --> 51:16.978
My little girl...

51:19.979 --> 51:21.061
Why?

51:28.062 --> 51:29.895
SYLVIE: Did you use condoms at least?

51:29.979 --> 51:31.020
ISABELLE: Yes.

51:35.771 --> 51:37.395
You swear you've quit?

51:38.687 --> 51:39.853
Yes.

51:47.604 --> 51:49.478
Bring the potatoes, Victor.

51:49.687 --> 51:50.978
Dinnertime, everyone.

51:58.979 --> 52:00.520
I've got good news.

52:00.687 --> 52:01.728
What?

52:01.854 --> 52:03.270
About winter vacation.

52:03.896 --> 52:04.936
You got it?

52:05.021 --> 52:07.061
Yep, the chalet's free.

52:07.229 --> 52:08.353
We're going skiing?

52:08.562 --> 52:10.561
You can retake the snowflake test!

52:11.479 --> 52:14.353
- I ski better than you.
- We'll see about that.

52:15.771 --> 52:17.436
Will you come with us?

52:20.062 --> 52:21.395
Of course,
why do you ask?

52:31.812 --> 52:33.811
What did I do wrong?

52:34.437 --> 52:36.228
Stop feeling guilty.

52:36.396 --> 52:37.603
But why?

52:37.771 --> 52:39.311
It's pointless.

52:39.646 --> 52:41.895
How could I miss the signs?

52:42.896 --> 52:45.478
Your daughter's such a pretty girl.

52:49.521 --> 52:50.811
What do you mean?

52:51.479 --> 52:54.061
It's no surprise she got offers.

52:55.187 --> 52:56.686
- Are you kidding?
- What?

52:56.854 --> 52:59.145
She's pretty, so she's a whore?

52:59.312 --> 53:01.145
That's not what I said.

53:01.312 --> 53:02.603
Don't talk shit.

53:05.812 --> 53:07.853
What did she tell you?

53:08.937 --> 53:10.895
Nothing. No explanation.

53:13.062 --> 53:16.311
The police say she needs time
to comprehend her actions.

53:19.104 --> 53:21.895
At least she quit when that man died.

53:22.437 --> 53:23.853
What if he hadn't died?

53:26.187 --> 53:28.311
She'd have continued, imagine!

53:29.771 --> 53:33.061
She needs more authority.
Maybe she should go to her dad's.

53:33.146 --> 53:35.645
We have enough trouble as it is.

53:36.646 --> 53:39.811
She'll give her statement tomorrow.

53:40.062 --> 53:42.853
You'll find a shrink
and go from there.

53:43.021 --> 53:44.645
No point being so dramatic.

53:45.021 --> 53:47.061
"Being so dramatic"?

53:47.354 --> 53:48.936
Do you realise what she's done?

53:49.062 --> 53:50.353
Of course I do.

53:50.562 --> 53:52.936
Give her some limits, punish her.

53:53.062 --> 53:55.270
She's grounded.
No computer, no phone.

53:55.812 --> 53:57.270
Does your son know?

53:57.437 --> 53:58.853
I suppose so.

53:59.062 --> 54:02.811
He saw the police
and heard me talking to Mouna.

54:03.479 --> 54:05.103
I'll talk to him tomorrow.

54:06.062 --> 54:07.103
Good.

54:11.812 --> 54:13.978
Think I'm in the mood?

54:14.104 --> 54:16.478
I just want to hold you.

54:18.021 --> 54:19.270
I'm sorry.

54:23.187 --> 54:25.478
ISABELLE: A man followed me after school.

54:25.771 --> 54:28.103
- He offered me money.
- Did you accept?

54:28.437 --> 54:29.645
No.

54:31.062 --> 54:34.436
He gave me his number
in case I changed my mind.

54:34.646 --> 54:37.186
0623214637.

54:42.229 --> 54:44.103
When did you call him?

54:44.854 --> 54:46.061
A week later.

54:47.187 --> 54:48.770
Where did you meet?

54:50.354 --> 54:52.811
Hotel Intercontinental at Opéra.

54:53.979 --> 54:55.020
Did you like it?

54:57.896 --> 54:59.270
Not at first.

55:01.396 --> 55:04.061
I was disgusted,
but wanted to try again.

55:04.354 --> 55:06.770
How did you try again?

55:07.896 --> 55:11.728
I saw a thing on TV
about students needing money.

55:13.979 --> 55:16.478
I got money in exchange for "favours"...

55:16.729 --> 55:19.228
I bought a second phone
and got started.

55:21.896 --> 55:22.978
Plan to continue?

55:24.104 --> 55:25.270
I don't know.

55:26.396 --> 55:27.978
It was an experience.

55:28.104 --> 55:29.478
A dangerous one.

55:29.812 --> 55:33.061
Johns can be violent.
No one protects you.

55:33.146 --> 55:34.853
Minors are easy prey.

55:35.729 --> 55:39.645
Prostitutes are frequently attacked,
raped, even murdered.

55:40.771 --> 55:43.603
Easy money is a downward spiral.

55:45.229 --> 55:47.353
Let's talk about Mr Georges Ferriere.

55:47.687 --> 55:49.811
Were you aware of anything?

55:49.979 --> 55:51.811
- His heart trouble?
- No.

55:52.229 --> 55:54.103
He was old, he took pills.

55:54.896 --> 55:56.103
What pills?

55:56.271 --> 55:57.811
I don't know. Viagra.

55:57.979 --> 55:59.686
Did you practise S&M?

56:00.104 --> 56:04.103
Risky erotic games?
Strangulation, handcuffs, brutality?

56:04.479 --> 56:05.811
No, it was normal.

56:08.354 --> 56:10.478
Why did you run away?

56:10.729 --> 56:12.561
I didn't know what to do.

56:15.271 --> 56:18.353
How long did you stay after he died?

56:18.562 --> 56:21.103
I don't know, I was in shock.
He was dead.

56:21.812 --> 56:23.186
You're sure he was dead?

56:23.354 --> 56:24.353
Yes.

56:25.271 --> 56:27.145
Had you ever seen a dead person?

56:27.312 --> 56:29.978
My grandfather,
but that was different.

56:30.937 --> 56:32.020
Did you take money?

56:33.396 --> 56:35.020
What we'd agreed upon.

56:36.312 --> 56:37.895
Are you keeping my money?

56:38.062 --> 56:39.686
You're a minor, your mother will.

56:43.604 --> 56:44.978
- Finish your yogurt?
- Yeah.

56:45.312 --> 56:47.061
Go get ready for bed.

56:50.229 --> 56:51.770
I'll leave you two alone.

56:51.937 --> 56:53.478
Stay, it's important.

56:58.187 --> 56:59.186
So...

57:00.604 --> 57:02.395
I asked at the hospital.

57:02.896 --> 57:04.811
They recommended someone very good.

57:04.896 --> 57:05.895
I'm not sick.

57:06.396 --> 57:08.395
But you need to talk to someone.

57:08.604 --> 57:10.061
I don't want to talk.

57:10.187 --> 57:13.311
After what happened,
therapy is mandatory.

57:13.479 --> 57:15.061
You can't force me.

57:15.229 --> 57:19.770
What do you prefer?
Therapy, or a mental institution?

57:24.687 --> 57:26.020
It's for your own good.

57:26.146 --> 57:28.270
It can't hurt to try.

57:30.437 --> 57:32.061
What about my money?

57:34.062 --> 57:35.853
I thought we might donate it

57:36.021 --> 57:37.436
to a charity.

57:37.646 --> 57:40.020
Like one that helps prostitutes.

57:40.146 --> 57:41.186
Great idea.

57:41.979 --> 57:42.978
Assholes!

57:59.812 --> 58:02.645
SYLVIE: It was a shock, I didn't understand.

58:03.062 --> 58:04.603
I still don't.

58:05.437 --> 58:07.853
She's always had whatever she wanted.

58:08.187 --> 58:09.936
I make a good living,

58:10.354 --> 58:12.478
I've always spoiled her.

58:12.687 --> 58:14.436
I give her money.

58:14.646 --> 58:16.853
She can buy anything she wants.

58:17.021 --> 58:18.186
Did you need money?

58:19.312 --> 58:20.353
No.

58:20.562 --> 58:21.686
Then why get paid?

58:21.854 --> 58:22.978
To know your worth?

58:23.729 --> 58:25.353
It was simpler, clearer.

58:25.771 --> 58:26.895
How can you say that?

58:27.062 --> 58:28.353
Let her speak.

58:29.896 --> 58:32.020
Were they older men?

58:32.437 --> 58:33.561
Obviously.

58:33.896 --> 58:34.895
Your father's age?

58:36.479 --> 58:37.478
Or yours.

58:41.479 --> 58:42.645
Tell me about him.

58:43.062 --> 58:44.436
Nothing to say.

58:45.354 --> 58:48.561
I can tell you
we separated seven years ago.

58:49.187 --> 58:50.603
He lives in Italy.

58:50.771 --> 58:53.561
He remarried and has a new baby.

58:53.729 --> 58:55.561
The kids see him on school breaks.

58:55.646 --> 58:56.645
Do you get along?

58:57.021 --> 58:58.603
Sure, he's my father.

58:59.062 --> 59:00.728
- Do you miss him?
- No.

59:01.104 --> 59:03.061
You have a right to be angry

59:03.187 --> 59:04.686
or sad.

59:05.896 --> 59:07.311
Do you get child support?

59:07.479 --> 59:10.478
Of course.
Everything's fine between us.

59:10.687 --> 59:11.936
Does he give you money?

59:12.646 --> 59:15.186
Yes, for my birthday and Christmas.

59:15.271 --> 59:16.978
- Enough?
- Yes.

59:17.187 --> 59:18.228
How much?

59:18.812 --> 59:22.353
500 at Christmas.
And for my birthday.

59:22.562 --> 59:23.978
This year he forgot.

59:24.104 --> 59:26.145
No, he sent me a cheque.

59:26.812 --> 59:28.061
You didn't tell me.

59:28.396 --> 59:30.020
Now, Isabelle,

59:30.146 --> 59:33.478
let's decide when to meet.

59:33.979 --> 59:36.853
Are you willing to come once a week?

59:38.146 --> 59:39.145
How much is it?

59:39.312 --> 59:40.311
70 euros.

59:40.479 --> 59:41.478
Is that all?

59:43.104 --> 59:44.311
That's my rate.

59:49.062 --> 59:52.478
I could pay with the money
from turning tricks.

59:52.854 --> 59:55.061
(LAUGHS) I don't think that's a good idea.

59:55.229 --> 59:56.936
I don't know, is it?

01:00:00.646 --> 01:00:01.728
Isabelle's right.

01:00:01.896 --> 01:00:03.228
It's her money.

01:00:04.062 --> 01:00:05.395
She earned it.

01:00:10.354 --> 01:00:12.228
- Hi, Isabelle.
- Hi, Peter.

01:00:14.396 --> 01:00:15.770
Hi, kids.

01:00:16.562 --> 01:00:18.020
Hi, Lucie.

01:00:20.729 --> 01:00:21.895
So?

01:00:22.396 --> 01:00:24.520
She seems fine, same as usual.

01:00:25.021 --> 01:00:26.311
What's she wearing?

01:00:27.812 --> 01:00:29.228
Hi, Isabelle.

01:00:29.354 --> 01:00:30.728
How are you, Vero?

01:00:30.937 --> 01:00:33.728
Tired, with Sophie teething.
But good.

01:00:33.937 --> 01:00:35.353
A bottle if she wakes up?

01:00:35.521 --> 01:00:37.561
Yes, it's all in the kitchen.

01:00:38.562 --> 01:00:39.645
Bye, Mum.

01:00:39.812 --> 01:00:41.020
Just heat it.

01:00:42.771 --> 01:00:44.145
She'll probably sleep.

01:00:44.312 --> 01:00:45.645
Wanna see my drawings?

01:00:45.812 --> 01:00:49.270
Don't pester Isabelle.
I want you in bed soon.

01:00:50.021 --> 01:00:52.936
- Help yourself if you're hungry.
- OK.

01:00:53.021 --> 01:00:55.603
Good luck.
We won't be late.

01:00:55.771 --> 01:00:56.936
Have fun.

01:01:20.229 --> 01:01:21.978
Password

01:01:49.604 --> 01:01:51.228
(BUZZING)

01:02:02.271 --> 01:02:04.603
Hello.

01:02:05.646 --> 01:02:07.020
I fell asleep.

01:02:07.187 --> 01:02:08.520
How'd it go?

01:02:09.437 --> 01:02:10.478
Fine.

01:02:10.562 --> 01:02:11.811
Did Sophie wake up?

01:02:12.021 --> 01:02:14.603
No, she's sleeping soundly.

01:02:15.021 --> 01:02:18.645
You came at 7:30.
That's six hours, right?

01:02:20.979 --> 01:02:23.353
Got money Peter? I only have 50.

01:02:24.521 --> 01:02:25.520
How much?

01:02:25.687 --> 01:02:26.686
10 euros.

01:02:29.396 --> 01:02:30.478
Thanks.

01:02:30.646 --> 01:02:32.270
Shall we, Isabelle?

01:02:37.104 --> 01:02:38.353
Peter, wait.

01:02:38.437 --> 01:02:39.478
What?

01:02:39.562 --> 01:02:40.978
I'll take her home.

01:02:41.604 --> 01:02:42.936
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

01:02:49.521 --> 01:02:52.061
Why didn't you want Peter to take me?

01:02:53.021 --> 01:02:54.728
I told you, he's up early.

01:02:54.937 --> 01:02:56.228
You don't trust me?

01:02:56.604 --> 01:02:58.020
Of course I do.

01:02:58.187 --> 01:02:59.520
Then you don't trust him.

01:02:59.687 --> 01:03:01.478
What are you on about?

01:03:02.354 --> 01:03:04.228
I know Mum told you everything.

01:03:04.479 --> 01:03:05.478
(CLEARS THROAT)

01:03:05.729 --> 01:03:08.145
I'm not the dangerous one.

01:03:09.229 --> 01:03:10.270
Meaning what?

01:03:20.979 --> 01:03:22.103
Hi.

01:03:23.396 --> 01:03:24.811
Hi! How's it going?

01:03:25.354 --> 01:03:26.395
I made 60 euros.

01:03:26.521 --> 01:03:27.603
What?

01:03:27.687 --> 01:03:28.770
Babysitting.

01:03:30.729 --> 01:03:31.770
Very funny.

01:03:33.562 --> 01:03:34.561
What are you watching?

01:03:34.729 --> 01:03:36.811
Nothing much, just crap.

01:03:37.771 --> 01:03:38.770
Waiting up for me?

01:03:38.979 --> 01:03:40.020
No.

01:03:41.937 --> 01:03:43.353
Is Mum in bed?

01:03:43.729 --> 01:03:46.603
Yes, she's exhausted.
It's tough right now.

01:03:46.771 --> 01:03:47.811
Why?

01:03:48.812 --> 01:03:51.561
Don't play innocent, you know why.

01:03:53.312 --> 01:03:54.311
What's with you?

01:03:54.396 --> 01:03:56.145
You make me laugh.

01:03:57.021 --> 01:03:58.186
I make you laugh?

01:03:59.354 --> 01:04:01.478
You remind me of a guy I slept with.

01:04:02.521 --> 01:04:03.686
A john.

01:04:16.312 --> 01:04:18.770
- What's this game, Isabelle?
- No game.

01:04:20.979 --> 01:04:23.436
Go easy on your mother, she's fragile.

01:04:23.896 --> 01:04:26.395
Talk to her, help her understand.

01:04:27.312 --> 01:04:28.686
It's hard for a mother.

01:04:28.896 --> 01:04:30.895
It's my business, my life.

01:04:31.396 --> 01:04:33.103
Make an effort, be nice.

01:04:33.271 --> 01:04:34.311
She's very upset.

01:04:35.729 --> 01:04:36.728
Are you?

01:04:36.937 --> 01:04:38.395
Yes, I'm upset, too.

01:04:38.562 --> 01:04:40.478
Doesn't matter, I'm not your dad.

01:04:40.646 --> 01:04:42.061
So what do you think?

01:04:44.479 --> 01:04:48.603
I think you're a teenager experimenting,

01:04:49.396 --> 01:04:52.145
testing her limits, transgressing.

01:04:52.729 --> 01:04:54.353
Ever slept with a whore?

01:04:55.271 --> 01:04:56.353
None of your business.

01:04:56.646 --> 01:04:59.061
Come on, tell me! I won't tell Mum.

01:04:59.229 --> 01:05:00.978
What's going on?

01:05:04.396 --> 01:05:05.770
We're just talking.

01:05:06.562 --> 01:05:07.978
Go to bed right now.

01:05:19.354 --> 01:05:20.353
Sorry, she...

01:05:20.521 --> 01:05:21.936
I know, be quiet.

01:05:24.937 --> 01:05:26.686
How about boarding school?

01:05:27.562 --> 01:05:28.686
I don't know.

01:05:30.771 --> 01:05:32.186
She's bad to the bone.

01:05:32.354 --> 01:05:33.978
What are you talking about?

01:05:34.729 --> 01:05:36.395
I saw how she looked at you.

01:05:36.562 --> 01:05:39.478
Relax, she's just being provocative.

01:05:41.312 --> 01:05:43.270
My own daughter disgusts me.

01:05:44.479 --> 01:05:46.728
You two need to have a long talk.

01:05:48.312 --> 01:05:49.603
Where are you going?

01:05:53.937 --> 01:05:55.353
What are you doing here?

01:05:56.187 --> 01:05:57.270
It's late.

01:06:00.562 --> 01:06:02.061
I've got an idea.

01:06:02.229 --> 01:06:03.228
What?

01:06:13.354 --> 01:06:17.353
How about a mother-daughter
shopping weekend in London?

01:06:17.979 --> 01:06:21.145
Peter's parents
could loan us their studio.

01:06:21.771 --> 01:06:23.395
We could see a musical.

01:06:24.729 --> 01:06:26.811
I hate musicals.

01:06:30.354 --> 01:06:32.811
What have we done to make you this way?

01:06:33.646 --> 01:06:35.061
I don't understand.

01:06:36.229 --> 01:06:38.395
We used to be close. We talked.

01:06:39.312 --> 01:06:41.645
- Is it because of Patrick?
- Course not.

01:06:44.312 --> 01:06:46.145
- What's the shrink say?
- Dumb stuff.

01:06:46.229 --> 01:06:47.228
Such as?

01:06:47.312 --> 01:06:48.770
None of your business.

01:06:50.896 --> 01:06:53.645
I was your age once,
I was wild, too.

01:06:54.021 --> 01:06:56.353
Yeah?
Were you a whore, too?

01:07:04.646 --> 01:07:05.645
I'm your mother.

01:07:05.812 --> 01:07:09.103
It's normal for me to worry
and try to fix things.

01:07:12.521 --> 01:07:14.353
I know about you and Peter.

01:07:16.396 --> 01:07:17.603
What do you mean?

01:07:20.062 --> 01:07:21.353
Are you sleeping together?

01:07:25.562 --> 01:07:28.353
If I said yes, what would that change?

01:07:30.104 --> 01:07:31.936
I'd know you trust me.

01:07:34.646 --> 01:07:36.353
You scare me, Isabelle.

01:07:49.437 --> 01:07:51.645
I liked making the appointments.

01:07:52.271 --> 01:07:54.395
Chatting on the Internet.

01:07:54.771 --> 01:07:56.353
Talking on the phone.

01:07:57.479 --> 01:07:58.811
Hearing their voices.

01:08:00.479 --> 01:08:02.061
Imagining things.

01:08:03.979 --> 01:08:05.145
Then going.

01:08:05.896 --> 01:08:07.478
Checking out the hotel.

01:08:08.521 --> 01:08:10.728
Wondering what he'd be like.

01:08:12.562 --> 01:08:13.978
It was like a game.

01:08:14.604 --> 01:08:15.811
A game

01:08:16.270 --> 01:08:17.560
that's dangerous.

01:08:17.895 --> 01:08:18.895
No.

01:08:19.895 --> 01:08:21.560
Well, a little.

01:08:23.229 --> 01:08:25.395
I didn't feel much during it.

01:08:27.979 --> 01:08:30.478
But when I thought about it at home

01:08:31.770 --> 01:08:33.228
or at school,

01:08:34.770 --> 01:08:36.645
I wanted to do it again.

01:08:37.895 --> 01:08:39.185
With someone else.

01:08:39.729 --> 01:08:41.645
Until that man died?

01:08:44.895 --> 01:08:45.935
Yes.

01:08:48.395 --> 01:08:49.603
Georges.

01:08:50.812 --> 01:08:53.770
You saw him several times,
this Georges?

01:08:54.645 --> 01:08:55.685
Yes.

01:08:56.687 --> 01:08:57.935
Why?

01:09:02.562 --> 01:09:04.020
He was nice.

01:09:06.770 --> 01:09:08.895
It was sweeter with him.

01:09:12.562 --> 01:09:14.728
He didn't want much, he'd just

01:09:17.562 --> 01:09:19.185
caress me,

01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:23.103
look at me.

01:09:28.104 --> 01:09:32.353
Except the last time.
He asked me to get on him.

01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:35.978
And he died.

01:09:44.395 --> 01:09:46.603
After that,
I didn't want to any more.

01:09:51.145 --> 01:09:52.810
I felt dirty.

01:09:53.229 --> 01:09:54.353
Dirty?

01:09:55.104 --> 01:09:56.186
Why?

01:10:00.354 --> 01:10:01.770
For killing him.

01:10:30.937 --> 01:10:32.186
What's up?

01:10:32.354 --> 01:10:33.936
I did it with Etienne.

01:10:34.104 --> 01:10:35.895
That's good news, isn't it?

01:10:36.396 --> 01:10:37.395
No.

01:10:38.229 --> 01:10:39.478
I was awful.

01:10:40.437 --> 01:10:41.895
He's avoiding me.

01:10:42.729 --> 01:10:44.978
Acting like nothing happened.

01:10:45.146 --> 01:10:46.811
Why, was it bad?

01:10:47.354 --> 01:10:49.103
It lasted three minutes.

01:10:49.437 --> 01:10:51.811
I felt nothing, I didn't know he came.

01:10:52.021 --> 01:10:53.728
It's no big deal.

01:10:53.937 --> 01:10:56.228
You've done it, you got it over with.

01:10:58.896 --> 01:11:00.395
Don't cry.

01:11:01.771 --> 01:11:04.145
The first time is always like that.

01:11:04.437 --> 01:11:06.811
How do you know?
You're still a virgin.

01:11:08.354 --> 01:11:09.645
You slept with your lawyer?

01:11:09.729 --> 01:11:10.728
No.

01:11:11.229 --> 01:11:12.270
No, but...

01:11:12.354 --> 01:11:14.228
I've read a lot about it.

01:11:14.354 --> 01:11:16.020
It's always the same.

01:11:20.104 --> 01:11:23.228
So, will Etienne be at Ben's party?

01:11:23.354 --> 01:11:24.561
Yes.

01:11:26.187 --> 01:11:27.978
I'll come with you.

01:11:30.187 --> 01:11:31.186
Thanks.

01:11:31.271 --> 01:11:32.436
It's OK.

01:11:36.062 --> 01:11:37.311
Mum's cool with it?

01:11:37.771 --> 01:11:39.686
Yeah, she talked to my shrink.

01:11:40.729 --> 01:11:43.103
- Who'll be there?
- Classmates.

01:11:46.437 --> 01:11:48.103
Do I look ugly?

01:11:49.271 --> 01:11:50.395
No, you're OK.

01:11:51.062 --> 01:11:52.061
No make-up?

01:11:52.437 --> 01:11:53.436
Should I?

01:11:53.896 --> 01:11:55.311
A little, yeah.

01:11:55.562 --> 01:11:57.728
Know what this girl in my class does?

01:11:57.812 --> 01:11:58.811
What?

01:11:58.896 --> 01:12:00.770
French kisses for 5 euros.

01:12:01.021 --> 01:12:02.311
That's cheap.

01:12:04.229 --> 01:12:05.270
Did you buy one?

01:12:05.354 --> 01:12:07.395
Heck no. I don't have to pay.

01:12:07.562 --> 01:12:08.978
No shame in it.

01:12:09.146 --> 01:12:10.811
Good way to learn.

01:12:13.604 --> 01:12:15.228
Know my friend Marco?

01:12:15.562 --> 01:12:16.895
I think so.

01:12:18.437 --> 01:12:20.020
He wants to do it with a girl.

01:12:20.187 --> 01:12:22.020
Forget it, he can't afford it.

01:12:22.229 --> 01:12:23.520
Didn't you stop?

01:12:25.771 --> 01:12:27.145
Yeah, I'm kidding.

01:12:33.271 --> 01:12:34.311
I'll get it.

01:12:34.687 --> 01:12:35.978
Don't say anything.

01:12:36.979 --> 01:12:37.978
Hi!

01:12:39.437 --> 01:12:40.436
Ready?

01:12:40.687 --> 01:12:41.686
Hi, ma'am.

01:12:41.771 --> 01:12:43.603
- How are you?
- Good, you?

01:12:43.687 --> 01:12:44.686
- Hello, Claire.
- Hello.

01:12:44.771 --> 01:12:46.811
Don't be late. Call if you need to.

01:12:47.021 --> 01:12:48.061
I will.

01:12:48.396 --> 01:12:50.020
- Have fun.
- Bye.

01:12:50.187 --> 01:12:51.936
Have fun, girls!

01:12:55.896 --> 01:12:58.728
It'll be fine.
You need to trust her.

01:12:59.354 --> 01:13:01.311
(♪ Dance music playing)

01:13:20.396 --> 01:13:21.436
Hey.

01:13:21.521 --> 01:13:22.561
Hi!

01:13:23.896 --> 01:13:24.895
Having fun?

01:13:24.979 --> 01:13:26.686
- Yeah, you?
- Yeah.

01:13:27.146 --> 01:13:28.353
Where you headed?

01:13:28.562 --> 01:13:29.686
Just around.

01:13:32.104 --> 01:13:34.103
(TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

01:14:31.437 --> 01:14:32.603
Hi, Isabelle.

01:14:33.729 --> 01:14:34.728
Hi.

01:14:35.521 --> 01:14:38.728
- Too hot for you, too?
- I just need air.

01:14:38.979 --> 01:14:40.186
Me, too.

01:14:41.271 --> 01:14:42.811
I think I drank too much.

01:14:45.521 --> 01:14:47.228
We never see you.

01:14:47.354 --> 01:14:48.436
Claire insisted.

01:14:49.521 --> 01:14:50.811
I'm glad.

01:14:54.354 --> 01:14:55.520
Want a smoke?

01:14:55.937 --> 01:14:56.936
Sure, thanks.

01:15:13.562 --> 01:15:15.770
What if I said I wanted to kiss you?

01:15:21.979 --> 01:15:23.603
Sorry, I'm a jerk.

01:15:27.646 --> 01:15:28.686
OK, kiss me.

01:15:31.062 --> 01:15:32.061
You sure?

01:15:33.896 --> 01:15:34.895

But I never dared.
