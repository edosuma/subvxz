00:04.467 --> 00:05.767

00:08.400 --> 00:09.200
- HEY.

00:09.200 --> 00:10.633

00:10.633 --> 00:12.567
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,
I'M CHEATING ON YOU?

00:12.567 --> 00:14.200
IS THAT IT?

00:14.200 --> 00:16.600
SHE MEANS NOTHING!

00:16.600 --> 00:17.933
YOU MISSED ME.
- [chuckling]

00:17.933 --> 00:19.867
- YOU MISSED ALL THAT FUN STUFF.

00:19.867 --> 00:22.267
- DADDY, WHAT DID YOU BRING US?

00:24.433 --> 00:26.767
- I BRING YOU?

00:26.767 --> 00:30.867
ALL RIGHT, WELL, LET'S SEE.

00:30.867 --> 00:34.567
I BROUGHT YOU SOMETHING.

00:34.567 --> 00:36.733
FOR MICHAEL,

00:36.733 --> 00:40.367
SOME LOVELY APRICOT SHAMPOO.

00:42.367 --> 00:44.167

THE ENCHANTED ISLE OF MARRIOTT.

01:02.633 --> 01:05.600
YOU HAVING TROUBLE
GETTING YOUR SHOES ON, ALLY?

01:05.600 --> 01:07.233
NOT ANYMORE.

01:08.667 --> 01:10.033
- RAY.

01:10.033 --> 01:13.200
- DON'T WORRY,
I DIDN'T FORGET YOU, MY DARLING.

01:13.200 --> 01:15.967
FOR MOMMY,
SOMETHING AS SWEET AS SHE IS,

01:15.967 --> 01:19.500
SOME FINE CANDY.

01:19.500 --> 01:21.767

01:21.767 --> 01:24.833
- YEAH, THAT'S PART
OF THE HOTEL'S TURNDOWN SERVICE.

01:24.833 --> 01:27.733
- WELL, TONIGHT YOU'RE GONNA
GET MY TURNDOWN SERVICE.

01:30.733 --> 01:34.167
- WELL, I GUESS MOMMY
DOESN'T WANT PEANUTS

01:34.167 --> 01:36.100
FROM THE SKY.

01:42.067 --> 01:43.633
- HI, EVERYBODY.

01:43.633 --> 01:45.167
- OH, THERE YOU ARE.

01:45.167 --> 01:46.667
- WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?

01:46.667 --> 01:51.000
- YEAH, YOU'RE JUST COMING
FROM ACROSS THE STREET.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.400
- YEAH, WELL,
I GOT CONFUSED

01:52.400 --> 01:54.500
AND WENT TO WHERE
I WISHED YOU LIVED.

01:59.933 --> 02:01.700
- ALL RIGHT, THEY'RE HERE,
LET'S DO THIS.

02:01.700 --> 02:03.767
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT,
WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER GUESTS?

02:03.767 --> 02:06.233
- WHAT OTHER GUESTS?
EVERYONE'S HERE.

02:06.233 --> 02:08.600
DO YOU HAVE THE MORTGAGE?
- YEAH, HERE WE GO.

02:08.600 --> 02:11.500
I'VE BEEN WAITING 30 YEARS
TO DO THIS.

02:16.233 --> 02:17.433
- THERE YOU GO.

02:17.433 --> 02:20.067
- THERE WE GO.
- OOH.

02:20.067 --> 02:21.900
- [chuckling]
YEAH.

02:21.900 --> 02:22.900
- OH-HO.

02:22.900 --> 02:23.900
- YAY.

02:23.900 --> 02:26.000
[applause]

02:26.000 --> 02:28.600
- THE HOUSE IS NOW PAID OFF.

02:28.600 --> 02:30.100
AND HERE'S
TO THE WONDERFUL PEOPLE

02:30.100 --> 02:31.300
AT LYNBROOK MORTGAGE,

02:31.300 --> 02:32.667
THANKS FOR THE CALENDARS,

02:32.667 --> 02:36.167
AND YOU CAN ALL KISS
MY GREAT AMERICAN ASS.

02:36.167 --> 02:37.400
- [laughs]

02:37.400 --> 02:38.700
- GRANDPA.
GRANDPA.

02:38.700 --> 02:41.700
- OH, OH, SORRY, KIDS.
DON'T SAY "ASS."

02:43.100 --> 02:45.900
HEY, THAT WAS FUN.
- YEAH.

02:45.900 --> 02:47.400
LET'S HAVE A REAL PARTY.

02:47.400 --> 02:49.567
MARIE,
GO GET OUR MARRIAGE LICENSE.

02:51.533 --> 02:54.800
- YOU KNOW, NOW THAT THE PLACE
IS ALL OURS,

02:54.800 --> 02:56.267
I CAN'T WAIT TO REDECORATE

02:56.267 --> 02:58.167
AND GET RID
OF SOME OF THAT OLD STUFF.

02:58.167 --> 03:00.600
SO LONG, FRANK.

03:00.600 --> 03:03.000
- ALL RIGHT.
CAN WE EAT, PLEASE?

03:03.000 --> 03:04.100
- YEAH, OKAY.
COME ON, KIDS.

03:04.100 --> 03:05.633
- MOM, DAD, CONGRATULATIONS.

03:05.633 --> 03:07.733
THE HOUSE BECOMES PART
OF YOUR ESTATE,

03:07.733 --> 03:10.900
WHICH, IN THE OLD COUNTRY,
WOULD BE PASSED DOWN

03:10.900 --> 03:13.600
TO THE FIRSTBORN SON.

03:13.600 --> 03:17.133
- IN THE OLD COUNTRY,
YOU'D BE WORKING IN THE CIRCUS.

03:19.933 --> 03:23.233
- MONKEY SUIT'S COMING OFF.

03:23.233 --> 03:24.733
- SO, MARIE,
WHAT HAPPENED?

03:24.733 --> 03:27.233
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA
HAVE A BIG PARTY TO CELEBRATE.

03:27.233 --> 03:29.600
- IT IS A PARTY.
I MADE BRUSCHETTA.

03:29.600 --> 03:32.600
- OH, WELL, I THOUGHT WHEN YOU
SAID YOU WERE HAVING A PARTY,

03:32.600 --> 03:33.633
THAT WOULD INCLUDE--

03:33.633 --> 03:35.100
I DON'T KNOW,
SOME FRIENDS.

03:35.100 --> 03:37.767
- OH, WHO HAS TIME
FOR FRIENDS?

03:37.767 --> 03:40.667
HAVE A DEVILED EGG, DEAR.

03:40.667 --> 03:42.733
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU
DON'T HAVE TIME FOR FRIENDS?

03:42.733 --> 03:45.433
- WELL, AFTER YOU
AND RAYMOND MOVED IN,

03:45.433 --> 03:48.833
I MEAN, I GUESS SOMEONE
HAD TO HELP YOU RAISE A FAMILY,

03:48.833 --> 03:50.067
SO WE HAD TO GIVE--

03:50.067 --> 03:52.833
WE JUST HAD TO
GIVE UP SOME THINGS.

03:52.833 --> 03:54.200
- YOUR SOCIAL LIFE?

03:54.200 --> 03:56.067
- WELL, WE STILL HAVE
A SOCIAL LIFE.

03:59.933 --> 04:01.867
- MA, ROBERT'S EATING
ALL THE DEVILED EGG,

04:01.867 --> 04:03.933
WON'T GIVE ME ANY.

04:03.933 --> 04:07.000
- THEY DON'T FEED US
ENOUGH IN THE CIRCUS.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.067
- YEAH, HA.

04:09.067 --> 04:10.067
- [laughs]

04:10.067 --> 04:11.667
[coughs]

04:15.533 --> 04:19.533
- HEY, DID MY FATHER
GIVE GEOFFREY SOME WINE TODAY?

04:20.633 --> 04:22.200
- NO, WHY?

04:22.200 --> 04:23.433
- 'CAUSE I WAS PUTTING HIM
TO BED,

04:23.433 --> 04:26.100
HE SAID,
"I LOVE YOU, MAN."

04:31.200 --> 04:34.967
PERHAPS YOU WOULD
LIKE SOME WINE.

04:34.967 --> 04:38.833
- HEY, LISTEN, YOU KNOW WHAT
YOUR MOM TOLD ME AT THAT PARTY?

04:38.833 --> 04:42.233
THEY DON'T HAVE ANY FRIENDS.

04:42.233 --> 04:45.000
- YOU SOUND SURPRISED.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.633
- WELL, IT'S KIND OF SAD.
IT'S KIND OF SAD.

04:47.633 --> 04:49.667
- WELL, IT'S NOT SAD
FOR THE PEOPLE

04:49.667 --> 04:52.067
WHO WOULD HAVE TO BE
THEIR FRIENDS.

04:53.667 --> 04:57.000
- EXCEPT WE HAVE
TO BE THEIR FRIENDS.

04:59.167 --> 05:01.500
- THAT IS A LITTLE SAD.
- YEAH.

05:01.500 --> 05:03.967
I MEAN, LOOK,
WE'RE THEIR WHOLE LIVES.

05:03.967 --> 05:07.833
AND IT OCCURRED TO ME
THAT IF THEY HAD MORE FRIENDS,

05:07.833 --> 05:10.300
WE'D HAVE LESS THEM.

05:13.133 --> 05:17.067
- HAVE YOU WORKED OUT
A BUDGET FOR THIS?

05:17.067 --> 05:19.100
- ALL RIGHT.
BREAK IT UP.

05:19.100 --> 05:20.500
- OH, WHAT?
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

05:20.500 --> 05:22.400
WE JUST SAW YOU.

05:22.400 --> 05:25.533
- WE JUST BROUGHT YOU
SOME LEFTOVERS.

05:25.533 --> 05:29.533
- THEY DON'T QUALIFY AS
LEFTOVERS IF THEY'RE STILL WARM.

05:29.533 --> 05:31.367
- LET'S WATCH SOME HIGHLIGHTS.

05:31.367 --> 05:34.233
- FRANK, YOU ALREADY
WATCHED THIS GAME.

05:34.233 --> 05:37.567
- SO I KNOW HOW GOOD
THE HIGHLIGHTS WILL BE.

05:37.567 --> 05:41.000
LET'S NOT RUIN THESE
BY TALKING.

05:42.300 --> 05:43.700
- [clears throat]

05:43.700 --> 05:47.700
SO, GOSH, MARIE,
IT MUST FEEL SO LIBERATING

05:47.700 --> 05:48.833
TO OWN THE HOUSE NOW, HUH?

05:48.833 --> 05:50.167
- YEAH.

05:50.167 --> 05:51.767
- GOSH, THINK OF ALL THE THINGS
YOU CAN DO NOW,

05:51.767 --> 05:54.067
LIKE, GOSH,
YOU COULD ENTERTAIN MORE.

05:54.067 --> 05:55.733
- HEY, WE JUST HAD A PARTY.

05:55.733 --> 05:58.033
WHAT ARE WE, STUDIO 54?

06:00.600 --> 06:03.967
- BUT, REALLY, YOU DESERVE
YOUR OWN SOCIAL LIFE, YOU KNOW?

06:03.967 --> 06:06.767
ESPECIALLY NOW THAT ALL
YOUR HOUSE OBLIGATIONS ARE OVER

06:06.767 --> 06:08.100
AND WE SEEM TO BE MANAGING.

06:08.100 --> 06:09.567
- MM-HMM.

06:09.567 --> 06:12.467
- NOW MIGHT BE THE PERFECT TIME
FOR YOU TO JUST SAY,

06:12.467 --> 06:14.400
"HI, NEIGHBOR."

06:17.600 --> 06:21.700
- I GOT ALL THE FRIENDS
I NEED RIGHT HERE.

06:21.700 --> 06:23.200
- YOU SEE, DEBRA?

06:23.200 --> 06:25.733
I MEAN, I WOULD LOVE
TO START ENTERTAINING AGAIN,

06:25.733 --> 06:27.000
BUT IF WE HAVE GUESTS,

06:27.000 --> 06:29.233
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO WITH THIS?

06:31.833 --> 06:33.333
- TELL THEM THAT YOU LOST A BET

06:33.333 --> 06:35.767
AND YOU GOT TO CLEAN
AND FEED HIM FOR ANOTHER YEAR.

06:41.933 --> 06:46.167
- COME ON, WE ALL KNOW THAT
FRANK CAN BE A LOT OF FUN.

06:46.167 --> 06:48.467
HEY, YOU KNOW WHO ELSE
IS A LOT OF FUN?

06:48.467 --> 06:49.967
THE MAUERS NEXT DOOR.
- MM-HMM.

06:49.967 --> 06:51.533
- I LIKE THE MAUERS, YEAH.
- YES.

06:51.533 --> 06:53.700
- NO CAN DO.

06:53.700 --> 06:54.900
- WELL, WHY NOT?

06:54.900 --> 06:56.600
- BECAUSE I MAY OR MAY NOT

06:56.600 --> 06:59.733
RECENTLY HAVE FLIPPED
ONE OF THEM THE BIRD.

07:02.900 --> 07:04.533
WHAT?

07:04.533 --> 07:08.633
HE WAS TRYING TO PUT A PIECE
OF GARBAGE IN OUR GARBAGE CAN.

07:08.633 --> 07:12.167
- WELL, THAT'S NO REASON
TO FLIP THEM A BIRD.

07:12.167 --> 07:15.700
- HEY, I CAN'T HAVE THE GARBAGE
MAN THINKING I DYE MY HAIR.

07:17.667 --> 07:21.767
- OH, SO THEN ALL THAT
IS NATURAL.

07:25.733 --> 07:28.933
- HEY, YOU KNOW WHO'S COOL?
THE STIPES.

07:28.933 --> 07:31.000
- YES, THE STIPES.
- YEAH.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.733
- WHO?
- YOU REMEMBER.

07:32.733 --> 07:36.400
THE--THOSE OLD, NICE PEOPLE
THAT ROBERT LIVED WITH

07:36.400 --> 07:38.100
THE FIRST TIME HE MOVED OUT?

07:38.100 --> 07:40.633
YEAH, IF THEY'RE STILL ALIVE,
THEY'RE VERY FRIENDLY.

07:42.600 --> 07:44.900
- I RAN INTO THE HUSBAND
IN A HARDWARE STORE,

07:44.900 --> 07:46.367
HE'S ACTUALLY NOT A JERK.

07:46.367 --> 07:48.000
- WELL, SEE,
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU GUYS

07:48.000 --> 07:49.767
WOULD HAVE A BLAST TOGETHER.

07:49.767 --> 07:51.200
- REALLY, PROBABLY WOULD.

07:51.200 --> 07:53.467
- BUT WHAT ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO DO WITH THESE STIPES?

07:53.467 --> 07:55.733
- I DON'T KNOW, YOU COULD...

07:55.733 --> 08:00.000
INVITE THEM OVER
FOR DINNER OR DRINKS.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.600
- YOU COULD PLAY
"GUESS WHAT I FORGOT."

08:14.700 --> 08:17.067
- WHAT ABOUT A BOARD GAME?

08:17.067 --> 08:19.567
- YES, YES, A BOARD GAME,
GREAT IDEA.

08:19.567 --> 08:22.000
- OH, THAT'S A GOOD IDEA,
DEBRA.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.800
FRANK, WE'RE HAVING COMPANY.

08:24.800 --> 08:27.500
- THEY BETTER LIKE SWEARING.

08:30.833 --> 08:34.267
- WELL, WHAT SHOULD WE DO?
SHOULD WE CALL THEM?

08:34.267 --> 08:36.400
- ONLY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

08:36.400 --> 08:37.400
[laughs]

08:37.400 --> 08:38.733
- YOU KNOW WHO HAS THEIR NUMBER?

08:38.733 --> 08:40.600
ROBERT, WHO LIVES IN YOUR HOUSE
RIGHT NOW.

08:40.600 --> 08:43.833
- OH, I HAVE SO MANY
MENU IDEAS.

08:43.833 --> 08:45.133
- YEAH, WE'RE ALL VERY EXCITED.

08:45.133 --> 08:46.267
OUT OF THE CHAIR, DAD.

08:46.267 --> 08:47.800
- YEAH, HEY.
- COME ON.

08:47.800 --> 08:49.200
- I JUST WANT TO WATCH--

08:49.200 --> 08:50.700
- YEAH, WELL, GO OUTSIDE.
MOM'S OUTSIDE.

08:50.700 --> 08:52.467
YOU'RE GONNA GO PLAY
WITH YOUR NEW FRIENDS.

08:52.467 --> 08:54.767
HERE HE COMES.
THERE HE GOES.

08:59.133 --> 09:01.333
YEAH.

09:01.333 --> 09:02.867
I KNOW THAT DANCE,

09:02.867 --> 09:07.333
THAT'S THE "I WANT
TO HAVE SEX WITH RAY" DANCE.

09:07.333 --> 09:12.300
AND HERE'S MY
"IF YOU INSIST" DANCE.

09:12.300 --> 09:14.333
WHAT ARE YOU--
DON'T LAUGH.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.267
- MMM.
- HEH, THIS IS FUN.

09:18.267 --> 09:19.833
THIS IS LIKE A DATE.

09:19.833 --> 09:23.633
- YEAH, EXCEPT ON A DATE,
YOU NEVER GOT TO LEVEL TWO.

09:23.633 --> 09:25.033
- [laughs]

09:25.033 --> 09:26.733
COME ON.
COME ON.

09:26.733 --> 09:28.067
- MMM.
- COME ON.

09:28.067 --> 09:29.067
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.

09:29.067 --> 09:30.200
- HI, DEARS!

09:30.200 --> 09:31.933
[all laughing]

09:31.933 --> 09:32.967
- COME ON, MOVE OVER.

09:32.967 --> 09:34.633
- YOU REMEMBER THE STIPES.

09:34.633 --> 09:36.867
- SEE, HARRY?
I TOLD YOU HE WAS HOME.

09:36.867 --> 09:37.867
- YEAH.

09:37.867 --> 09:40.533
- HOW MAY WE HELP YOU?

09:40.533 --> 09:42.467
- YOU KNOW, HARRY'S A BIG FAN
OF YOUR COLUMN,

09:42.467 --> 09:45.900
AND HE WOULDN'T LET UP
UNTIL WE SWUNG BY TO SAY HELLO.

09:45.900 --> 09:46.900
- HELLO.

09:46.900 --> 09:48.533
[all laughing]

09:48.533 --> 09:50.733
- SO, LISTEN,
IT'S SO NICE TO SEE YOU,

09:50.733 --> 09:52.133
THANKS FOR DROPPING BY.

09:52.133 --> 09:54.000
- HEY, RAY, I TOLD HARRY
YOU WOULD LET HIM

09:54.000 --> 09:56.067
SEE TOMORROW'S COLUMN TODAY.

09:56.067 --> 09:57.533
- YEAH, YOU KNOW
WHAT I'D REALLY LIKE,

09:57.533 --> 09:59.933
IF YOU'D TELL ME
TOMORROW'S SCORES.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.967
YEAH, THEN I COULD
MAKE SOME BETS.

10:01.967 --> 10:05.867
[all laughing]

10:05.867 --> 10:08.800
- MOM, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHY'D YOU BRING 'EM HERE?

10:08.800 --> 10:11.400
- WELL, THEY WANTED TO SEE YOU.

10:11.400 --> 10:14.500
- WELL, YEAH, BUT DEBRA AND I,
WE WERE--HAPPY.

10:15.967 --> 10:17.100
- JUST FIVE MINUTES, OKAY?

10:17.100 --> 10:18.600
- WELL, NO, MA.
NO. NO. NO.

10:18.600 --> 10:21.400
- WHY ARE YOU
MAKING SUCH A BIG FUSS OVER IT?

10:21.400 --> 10:23.333
OUR FRIENDS
WANTED TO SEE YOU.

10:23.333 --> 10:26.233
- I WANT THEM TO SEE YOU.

10:26.233 --> 10:28.533
- ALL RIGHT.
OKAY.

10:28.533 --> 10:30.333
I'M SORRY.

10:30.333 --> 10:33.433
I'M SORRY PEOPLE
LIKE YOU SO MUCH.

10:33.433 --> 10:35.967
I'M SORRY THAT I'M PROUD

11:53.100 --> 11:55.167
OUR SON WOULD LOVE THIS,

11:55.167 --> 11:57.267
HE'S A REGULAR SPORTS NUT.

11:57.267 --> 11:58.567

12:03.200 --> 12:04.533
BUT I SNEAK UP BEHIND HIM

12:04.533 --> 12:06.233
AND I KIND OF GOOSE HIM

13:05.267 --> 13:07.233
THE STIPES ARE OVER
VISITING YOUR PARENTS AGAIN.

13:07.233 --> 13:08.967
WE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE
IN CASE THEY DECIDE

13:08.967 --> 13:10.767
TO DROP BACK OVER.

13:10.767 --> 13:12.533

13:12.533 --> 13:14.000

13:15.700 --> 13:17.200
I'M TIRED.
CAN'T WE JUST HIDE?

13:17.200 --> 13:18.800
- NO, NO, NO.

13:18.800 --> 13:21.567
DON'T UNBUTTON YOUR SHIRT.
STOP IT, STOP IT, STOP IT.

13:21.567 --> 13:24.233
- YOU DON'T KNOW THAT THEY'RE
DEFINITELY GONNA COME OVER.

13:24.233 --> 13:25.767
- YEAH, YOU'D PROBABLY
LOVE IT IF THEY DID,

13:25.767 --> 13:27.767
YOU COULD DO A REVIVAL
OF YOUR ONE-MAN SHOW,

13:27.767 --> 13:31.067
"MY FAIR RAYMOND."

13:31.067 --> 13:33.333
- HEY, I WAS TRYING TO HELP OUT.

13:33.333 --> 13:34.667
THAT'S WHY I GOT STUCK THERE,

13:34.667 --> 13:36.267
AND WHERE'D YOU
DISAPPEAR TO ANYWAY?

13:36.267 --> 13:38.767
- I WAS IN BED.
IT WAS MIDNIGHT.

13:38.767 --> 13:40.967
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE
AN INTERMISSION.

13:40.967 --> 13:42.200
- WHAT?
WHAT, DO YOU--

13:42.200 --> 13:44.567
WHAT, YOU THINK I LIKED THAT?
COME ON.

13:44.567 --> 13:47.067
THOSE STIPES SMELL
LIKE THE ATTIC.

13:48.600 --> 13:50.733
- HEY, WHERE'S THE CANDY?
THE KIDS WANT SOME CANDY.

13:50.733 --> 13:53.467
- THE KIDS KNOW THEY'RE NOT
SUPPOSED TO HAVE CANDY AT NIGHT.

13:53.467 --> 13:55.100
- OKAY.

13:55.100 --> 13:57.100
I WANT CANDY.

14:00.533 --> 14:02.700
- IT'S ON TOP OF THE FRIDGE,
ROBERT.

14:02.700 --> 14:04.600
COME ON, COME ON, BUTTON UP.
WE GOT TO GET GOING.

14:04.600 --> 14:06.267
WE'LL CALL YOU

14:06.267 --> 14:07.867
- SO, HEY, RAY,
HOW COME YOU'RE NOT GOING OVER

14:07.867 --> 14:11.467
TO SEE YOUR NEW BEST FRIENDS,
THE STIPES, HUH?

14:11.467 --> 14:13.467
MOM WAS JUST GOING
ON AND ON ABOUT IT,

14:13.467 --> 14:15.500
HOW THEY LOVED YOUR STORIES.

14:15.500 --> 14:16.300
- SEE, RAY?

14:16.300 --> 14:17.733
- I WAS BEING POLITE.

14:17.733 --> 14:20.500
- YOU KNOW THEY
WERE MY FRIENDS FIRST.

14:20.500 --> 14:22.033
THEY WOULD'VE LOVED
MY STORIES TOO.

14:22.033 --> 14:23.900
I JUST HAPPENED TO BE
IN A SITZ BATH

14:23.900 --> 14:25.300
WHEN THEY CAME OVER.

14:25.300 --> 14:27.000
- ALL RIGHT.
ROBERT, WE WON'T BE LATE.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.100
COME ON.
WE GOT TO GO.

14:28.100 --> 14:29.333
- I'M NOT HUNGRY.
COME ON.

14:29.333 --> 14:31.067
I HAD BANANA SPLITS
AT THE OFFICE.

14:31.067 --> 14:34.433
- YOU GET BANANA SPLITS
AT THE OFFICE?

14:34.433 --> 14:37.833

14:44.033 --> 14:45.467
WE'RE GOING OUT, YOU UNDERSTAND?

14:45.467 --> 14:46.500
HI.

14:46.500 --> 14:49.533
- THERE HE IS,
THE MAN OF THE HOUR.

14:49.533 --> 14:50.367
- HI.

14:50.367 --> 14:51.533

14:51.533 --> 14:53.267
NO, I JUST--

14:53.267 --> 14:55.100

14:56.333 --> 14:59.467
I WANT YOU TO MEET OUR SON,
SETH.

14:59.467 --> 15:01.400

15:04.967 --> 15:06.633
- WE HAVE VERY SIMILAR
WRITING STYLES.

15:06.633 --> 15:09.233
- SETH'S A SPORTSWRITER TOO.
- OH.

15:09.233 --> 15:11.300
- WELL,
MOSTLY IN INTERNET CHAT ROOMS,

15:11.300 --> 15:15.033
AND I CALL IN
TO ALL THE SPORTS RADIO SHOWS.

15:15.033 --> 15:16.233
YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD ME.

15:16.233 --> 15:19.000

15:23.867 --> 15:25.200
- YES. YES.

15:25.200 --> 15:26.667
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

15:26.667 --> 15:28.267
- WE'RE JUST GOING
OUT TO DINNER,

15:28.267 --> 15:30.067
BUT YOU GUYS MAKE YOURSELF
AT HOME, YOU KNOW.

15:30.067 --> 15:32.133
MARIE KNOWS WHERE EVERYTHING IS.

15:32.133 --> 15:35.133
SHE PUT IT THERE, SO--

15:44.200 --> 15:45.267
- THANKS.
- THANKS.

15:45.267 --> 15:46.467
- EXCEPT YOU COULD BE

15:46.467 --> 15:49.367
A LITTLE MORE OBJECTIVE
ABOUT THE METS.

15:50.933 --> 15:52.567
- WHAT DO YOU--WHAT?
- RAY, RAY.

15:52.567 --> 15:55.567
- YOU SEEM TO HAVE A REAL AXE
TO GRIND THERE.

15:55.567 --> 15:57.500
- WELL...

15:57.500 --> 15:59.333
WAIT, LISTEN,
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THEY PAY ME

15:59.333 --> 16:02.400
TO WRITE MY OPINIONS,
NOT TO BE OBJECTIVE.

16:02.400 --> 16:05.767
YOU KNOW, I FIND THAT,
IN SPORTS WRITING,

16:05.767 --> 16:07.700
IF YOU PULL YOUR PUNCHES,

16:07.700 --> 16:09.533
YOU'RE GONNA END UP THE ONE
GETTING HIT.

16:09.533 --> 16:13.367
- OH.
NOW, THAT'S A PRO, SON.

16:13.367 --> 16:16.200
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE STILL
ON THAT INTERNET.

16:16.200 --> 16:19.100
- HEY.
I BOW TO THE MASTER.

16:19.100 --> 16:20.833
- RAY...
[laughs]

16:20.833 --> 16:22.300
- HEY, RITA, HARRY.

16:22.300 --> 16:24.033
SORRY I MISSED YOU LAST NIGHT.

16:24.033 --> 16:27.400
- HEY, RODNEY.
SO--

16:27.400 --> 16:29.733
RAY, TELL SETH THAT STORY
YOU WERE TELLING US

16:29.733 --> 16:32.833
ABOUT THE SQUIRREL THAT RAN UP
YOUR LEG AT THE KING DOME.

16:32.833 --> 16:34.633
- OH, THAT WAS SO FUNNY.

16:34.633 --> 16:37.800
- AH, YOU TOLD THEM THE SQUIRREL
STORY, HUH, RAY?

16:37.800 --> 16:41.200
YEAH, ISN'T
THAT CHUCK WILSON'S STORY?

16:41.200 --> 16:42.500
- THAT'S NOT
CHUCK WILSON'S STORY.

16:42.500 --> 16:44.933
- [whispering] YES, IT IS.
YEAH.

16:44.933 --> 16:47.300
- IT'S NOT.

16:47.300 --> 16:50.600
- I'LL TELL YOU A STORY.

16:50.600 --> 16:54.933
I WAS RECENTLY GORED
BY A BULL

16:54.933 --> 16:59.600
WHICH IS ABOUT 2,000 TIMES
LARGER THAN A SQUIRREL.

16:59.600 --> 17:01.967
YOU SEE, THEY WERE HAVING
AN ILLEGAL RODEO--

17:01.967 --> 17:04.033
- OH, HERE IT IS.

17:04.033 --> 17:06.033
RAYMOND, WOULD YOU MIND?

17:06.033 --> 17:07.333
- WHAT, YOU WANT
TO TAKE MY PICTURE?

17:07.333 --> 17:09.933
- YES.
- OKAY, YEAH.

17:09.933 --> 17:11.467
- HERE.

17:11.467 --> 17:14.733
RODNEY, WOULD YOU MIND
GETTING A PICTURE OF ALL OF US?

17:17.800 --> 17:19.367
- WHY WOULD I MIND?

17:19.367 --> 17:22.100
ADD A LITTLE INSULT
TO MY INJURY.

17:22.100 --> 17:24.367
- I WANT TO GET IN ON THIS.
COME ON, FRANK.

17:24.367 --> 17:25.800
- I'M IN,
BUT I'D BETTER SIT DOWN,

17:25.800 --> 17:29.067
UNLESS YOU WANT TO GET A SHOT
OF MY GARAGIOLA.

17:29.067 --> 17:32.167
- THIS IS PHENOMENAL.
I'M POSTING THIS ON MY WEB SITE.

17:32.167 --> 17:34.100
- HEY, YOU GOT US
IN FOCUS THERE?

17:34.100 --> 17:35.300
- I SURE DO.

17:35.300 --> 17:38.200
EVERYBODY, SAY "RAYMOND."

17:38.200 --> 17:40.700
all: RAYMOND.

17:40.700 --> 17:42.733
[camera shutter clicks]

17:42.733 --> 17:43.733
[door closes]

17:43.733 --> 17:45.667
- BEAUTIFUL.
- YEAH.

17:47.633 --> 17:48.733
HEY, WHERE'S DEB?

17:48.733 --> 17:50.067
- I HEARD THE GARAGE DOOR.

17:50.067 --> 17:51.100
- OH, NO.

17:51.100 --> 17:53.733
- OH, RAYMOND, STAY WITH US.

17:53.733 --> 17:56.267
YOU CAN SEE HER ANYTIME.

17:59.867 --> 18:01.300
- HEY, HEY, HEY,
WHERE YOU GOING?

18:01.300 --> 18:02.333
- I'M GOING TO EAT.

18:02.333 --> 18:03.433
I WOULD ASK YOU TO COME ALONG,

18:03.433 --> 18:04.767
BUT I SEE YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND

18:04.767 --> 18:06.633
AND THREE BOYFRIENDS
AND ANOTHER GIRLFRIEND.

18:06.633 --> 18:08.100
OH, COME ON.
LOOK, IT'S OKAY.

18:08.100 --> 18:09.633
THEY SAID I COULD
SEE OTHER PEOPLE.

18:09.633 --> 18:11.200
OKAY, ALL RIGHT, I'M SORRY,
STOP.

18:11.200 --> 18:12.667
- YOU HAVE A PROBLEM.
- GIVE ME YOUR KEYS.

18:12.667 --> 18:14.767
YOU CAN'T DRIVE
IN THIS CONDITION.

18:14.767 --> 18:16.033
WHAT--

18:16.033 --> 18:18.200
COME ON, I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM.

18:18.200 --> 18:19.500
- THIS CAN'T
KEEP HAPPENING, RAY.

18:19.500 --> 18:21.267
YOU HAVE A SICK CONNECTION
TO YOUR PARENTS.

18:21.267 --> 18:22.700
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?
IT IS SICK.

18:22.700 --> 18:24.433
- ALL RIGHT.
WE'VE ALREADY BEEN OVER THAT.

18:24.433 --> 18:25.967
- YEAH, BUT YOU'RE WORSE NOW.

18:25.967 --> 18:28.167
YOU DON'T GET ENOUGH
ATTENTION FROM YOUR PARENTS,

18:28.167 --> 18:29.833
SO YOU HAVE TO GET AN EXTRA SET?
YOU'RE SICK.

18:29.833 --> 18:32.000
- OKAY, I WON'T DO IT ANYMORE.
COME ON, I'M SORRY--

18:32.000 --> 18:33.367
[stammering]

18:33.367 --> 18:34.867
COME ON, LET'S GO.
WE'LL SNEAK OUT.

18:34.867 --> 18:35.867
WE'LL GO EAT.

18:35.867 --> 18:38.267
- HI, DEARS.

18:38.267 --> 18:40.167
- HI.

18:40.167 --> 18:41.500

18:41.500 --> 18:43.433
- EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?
- FINE. YEAH. YEAH.

18:43.433 --> 18:46.233
DID YOU FIND THAT AAA BOOKLET
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THERE, DEBRA?

18:46.233 --> 18:49.167
- YOU'RE SICK!

18:49.167 --> 18:51.233
- ALL RIGHT.
KEEP LOOKING.

18:51.233 --> 18:54.500
LISTEN, YOU KNOW,
I THINK YOU AND THE STIPES

18:54.500 --> 18:56.567
SHOULD GO TO YOUR HOUSE
MAYBE FOR THE REST OF THE NIGHT

18:56.567 --> 18:58.533
'CAUSE DEBRA AND I,
WE MADE PLANS TO GO OUT AND EAT.

18:58.533 --> 19:00.233
- OH, I KNOW, I KNOW,
BUT COULDN'T YOU JUST

19:00.233 --> 19:01.567
SPEND A FEW MINUTES WITH US?

19:01.567 --> 19:03.600
I MEAN, YOU HARDLY TALKED
TO SETH AT ALL.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.533
- WELL, MA,
I DON'T EVEN KNOW SETH, OKAY?

19:05.533 --> 19:06.833
I DON'T EVEN KNOW THE STIPES.

19:06.833 --> 19:08.500
THE STIPES ARE YOUR FRIENDS.

19:08.500 --> 19:11.000
WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO
AND BE WITH YOUR FRIENDS?

19:11.000 --> 19:12.600
- BECAUSE WE NEED YOU, RAYMOND.

19:12.600 --> 19:14.600
- WELL, WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU NEED ME?

19:14.600 --> 19:17.700
WHY?
DAD'S IN THERE, HE'S FUNNY.

19:17.700 --> 19:20.433
- NO, HE'S NOT.

19:20.433 --> 19:23.267
COULDN'T YOU COME IN
FOR JUST A FEW MINUTES?

19:26.233 --> 19:27.867
- NO, NO, NO.

19:27.867 --> 19:29.967
MA, IT'S ENOUGH, PLEASE.
IT'S ENOUGH.

19:29.967 --> 19:31.367
- OKAY, OKAY.
- YEAH.

19:31.367 --> 19:33.700
- IT'S FINE.
I UNDERSTAND.

19:33.700 --> 19:36.700
IT'S JUST THAT I--
I LIKE TO SEE YOU WITH THEM

19:36.700 --> 19:40.667
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, I DON'T GET
TO SEE YOU LIKE THAT ANYMORE.

19:40.667 --> 19:41.867
- WHAT?
LIKE WHAT?

19:41.867 --> 19:44.167
- WELL, WHEN YOU COME OVER
TO THE HOUSE NOW,

19:44.167 --> 19:46.300
IT'S JUST TO EAT
OR WATCH A GAME,

19:46.300 --> 19:51.700
AND IT'S DIFFERENT TO SEE YOU
EXCITED WHEN YOU'RE TALKING.

19:51.700 --> 19:54.067
I LIKE IT.

19:59.867 --> 20:02.900
- [sighs]

20:02.900 --> 20:04.267
OKAY.

20:04.267 --> 20:07.900
GUESS WE SHOULD ALL
GO BACK INSIDE.

20:07.900 --> 20:09.567
- REALLY?
YEAH?

20:09.567 --> 20:10.900
OKAY.
I GUESS IT'S OKAY.

20:10.900 --> 20:13.500
- OH, YOU'RE SUCH A GOOD SON.

20:13.500 --> 20:15.967
THANK YOU, HONEY.
- MM-HMM.

20:15.967 --> 20:18.067
- HE'S COMING BACK.

20:20.500 --> 20:23.267
- GOT TO GIVE THE PEOPLE
WHAT THEY WANT.

20:25.300 --> 20:27.700
- A COMMON MISCONCEPTION
IS THAT A BULL

20:27.700 --> 20:30.267
WILL CHARGE
WHEN SHOWN THE COLOR RED.

20:30.267 --> 20:31.933
ACTUALLY, IT'S MOTION--

20:31.933 --> 20:35.133

20:39.533 --> 20:40.900
- OH, YEAH.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

20:40.900 --> 20:42.000
- LATE FOR WHAT?

20:42.000 --> 20:43.333
- WE'RE TAKING YOUR PARENTS

20:43.333 --> 20:47.933
TO THE BIG SENIOR JAMBOREE
AT THE V.F.W.

20:47.933 --> 20:49.900
- WOW.

20:49.900 --> 20:52.000
WELL, THAT'S PERFECT.
THAT'S PERFECT FOR YOU.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.233
MA, YOU'LL HAVE FUN.

20:53.233 --> 20:54.833
YOU GO, YOU'LL HAVE FUN.
GO AHEAD.

20:54.833 --> 20:57.700
- YOU SHOULD GO TOO, RAY.

20:57.700 --> 20:58.733
- WHAT?

20:58.733 --> 21:00.333
- YEAH, YOU WERE
JUST TELLING YOUR MOM

21:00.333 --> 21:02.367
THAT YOU WANTED TO SPEND
MORE TIME WITH THEM.

21:02.367 --> 21:03.767
- YEAH, COME ON WITH US, RAY.

21:03.767 --> 21:07.600
THEY'RE GIVING

I MEAN, LOOK, NO.

21:09.067 --> 21:10.333
WE WANTED TO GO OUT TO EAT
YOU KNOW?

21:10.333 --> 21:11.800
RIGHT?
SO, NO.

21:11.800 --> 21:15.900
- BUT YOU GOT TO GIVE THE PEOPLE
WHAT THEY WANT.

21:15.900 --> 21:18.333
- COME ON, RAYMOND.
THERE'LL BE REFRESHMENTS.

21:18.333 --> 21:19.533
COME ON, COME ON.

21:19.533 --> 21:20.967
- [sighs]
HOW BAD IS THIS THING?

21:20.967 --> 21:22.267
- SOUNDS LIKE A NIGHTMARE TO ME.

21:22.267 --> 21:24.500
I'M NOT GOING.

21:24.500 --> 21:26.267
- BYE-BYE.

21:26.267 --> 21:29.033
- I HOPE YOU LIKE DANCING,
RAYMOND.

21:33.500 --> 21:34.833
