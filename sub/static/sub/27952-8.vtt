WEBVTT

00:06.131 --> 00:08.633
Oh, thanks, Nurse Alvarez.

00:08.717 --> 00:10.343
But are you sure it's not appendicitis?

00:10.427 --> 00:11.803
I searched WebMD,

00:11.886 --> 00:14.139
and they said it could be
all sorts of things, even cancer.

00:14.222 --> 00:16.391
Oh, god! Do you think I have cancer?

00:17.058 --> 00:19.686
It's not cancer, but your family
is still gonna be be very upset.

00:19.769 --> 00:20.603
It's gas.

00:21.646 --> 00:22.731
Are you sure?

00:22.814 --> 00:25.692
You had Cajun food at 3:00 a.m.
Yeah, I'm sure.

00:26.526 --> 00:28.194
Just take some antacid. You'll be fine.

00:28.611 --> 00:29.988
[chuckles softly]

00:37.996 --> 00:40.582
Hey, Doc, maybe I'm just
second-guessing myself,

00:40.665 --> 00:42.250
-but can I get a consult?
-[Leslie] Sure.

00:42.333 --> 00:44.627
Mrs. Homer came in
with some stomach pain.

00:44.711 --> 00:46.546
She had intestinal discomfort?

00:46.629 --> 00:48.715
Yeah, but she also ate two pounds
of blackened catfish.

00:48.798 --> 00:52.218
Penelope, have you learned anything at all
studying for your board exams?

00:53.094 --> 00:55.180
A nurse practitioner should know

00:55.263 --> 00:59.517
that appendicitis classically presents
as lower right quadrant pain.

00:59.934 --> 01:03.021
If her appendix ruptures, she could die.

01:03.438 --> 01:04.856
Or worse, sue me!

01:06.316 --> 01:09.944
I would be penniless.
I would lose my penny collection,

01:10.028 --> 01:12.155
and it's all your fault.

01:13.990 --> 01:14.991
[Mrs. Homer groans]

01:15.075 --> 01:17.452
I don't feel so good.

01:17.535 --> 01:18.745
On second thought,

01:18.828 --> 01:20.830
We should check
your appendix to make sure it doesn't...

01:20.914 --> 01:23.166
-[splats]
-[screams] ...rupture.

01:24.459 --> 01:25.502
[breathes heavily]

01:32.050 --> 01:33.927
[exhales]

01:34.010 --> 01:35.428
So, I had an anxiety attack.

nobody exploded for real, right?

02:30.775 --> 02:31.609
No.

02:31.693 --> 02:32.819
Oh, man!

02:34.404 --> 02:36.322
She did drop a monster belch
in the hallway.

02:36.406 --> 02:37.991
Nice.

02:38.324 --> 02:39.951
She never even came back in,

02:40.034 --> 02:42.078
but at that moment, I started to spiral,

02:42.162 --> 02:44.289
and my brain went
to the worst-case scenario.

02:44.372 --> 02:47.458
My worst-case scenario
is the world ending,

02:47.542 --> 02:49.419
and I have to eat my mother.

02:49.502 --> 02:50.420
Ew.

02:51.212 --> 02:54.007
And the whole time,
all she's talking about is,

02:54.090 --> 02:56.676
"You are still too skinny."

02:57.677 --> 02:58.845
So you get it.

03:00.847 --> 03:03.391
Once my brain goes there,
I can barely breathe.

03:04.267 --> 03:07.437
So, everybody here is familiar
with anxiety attacks, right?

03:07.520 --> 03:08.438
I don't get those.

03:08.521 --> 03:12.066
You never spiral
into intense feelings of fear

03:12.150 --> 03:15.028
accompanied by palpitations
and troubled breathing?

03:15.111 --> 03:17.071
Oh, yeah, I get those all the time.

03:18.948 --> 03:21.743
After mine, I'm just drenched in sweat.

03:21.826 --> 03:24.954
So to cover, I say,
"I just got some. Up top!"

03:25.038 --> 03:26.831
[laughs]

03:26.915 --> 03:29.542
Well, I always freak out during fireworks.

03:29.626 --> 03:30.752
-Yes.
-Yeah.

03:30.835 --> 03:32.962
Makes me feel
like I'm right back in combat.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.172
I know, right?

03:34.255 --> 03:36.174
The other day, a kid threw a snap at me.

03:36.257 --> 03:38.384
Before I knew it, I had him in a headlock.

03:38.718 --> 03:41.054
Now, the judge says
I gotta clean some parks.

03:43.223 --> 03:45.558
I just put my back against the wall

03:45.642 --> 03:48.311
and try to remind myself
that I am safe in my apartment.

03:49.479 --> 03:52.482
And then I remember how much I pay
for a one bedroom in Koreatown.

03:53.524 --> 03:55.902
Then the cycle just starts all over again.

03:57.320 --> 04:00.406
Grounding yourself is so important.

04:00.949 --> 04:02.533
Sit somewhere you feel safe.

04:03.952 --> 04:08.122
Focus on your breath
and think about what's real.

04:08.873 --> 04:11.167
All great coping mechanisms.

04:11.834 --> 04:12.919
Is something triggering you?

04:14.420 --> 04:15.922
That's just it. No.

04:16.005 --> 04:19.133
I mean, I have
these life-changing tests coming up,

04:19.217 --> 04:21.135
but I have that under control
because I have to.

04:21.219 --> 04:25.014
I've been working on it for two years now,
and it's all getting real real.

04:25.974 --> 04:28.518
Plus, I have a sexually-active
teenage daughter,

04:28.601 --> 04:31.562
a fragile, elderly mother,
and a son doing drugs.

04:31.646 --> 04:33.064
[breathes shakily]

04:33.147 --> 04:35.024
But I think I'm handling it well.

04:36.901 --> 04:38.861
Aw, honey, you're a mess.

04:38.945 --> 04:40.947
[laughs]

04:41.030 --> 04:44.242
Okay, maybe it is all getting to me,

04:44.617 --> 04:47.287
but I have found
some coping mechanisms that work.

04:50.081 --> 04:51.416
Alex, did you do your homework?

04:57.255 --> 04:58.756
This is my homework.

05:00.967 --> 05:03.219
I'm in high school.

05:03.303 --> 05:04.304
[gasps]

05:04.929 --> 05:08.558
I'm majoring in doobies
with a minor in Doritos.

05:11.352 --> 05:15.189
Ooh! I can turn this into a bong.

05:17.567 --> 05:19.068
Okay. [exhales]

05:20.987 --> 05:23.740
Relax. [breathes heavily]

05:23.823 --> 05:26.617
What's real? What's really happening?

05:32.623 --> 05:36.210
I'm literally about to do my homework.
You don't have to remind me.

05:36.294 --> 05:38.338
[hyperventilates]

05:38.421 --> 05:39.297
Are you okay?

05:40.298 --> 05:41.674
Why are you breathing so heavy?

05:44.135 --> 05:47.055
The ghost of your abuelito just passed
through me.

05:49.682 --> 05:50.600
That makes sense.

05:52.352 --> 05:55.188
Abuelita comes out of her curtain
all sweaty and says that too.

05:57.899 --> 06:00.526
No one says "doobie" anymore, stupid.

06:02.236 --> 06:03.780
You're the same age as me, stupid.

06:06.741 --> 06:08.785
I'm having a really rough time, Pam.

06:09.535 --> 06:12.163
The anxiety attacks are coming on
stronger and faster.

06:12.246 --> 06:16.042
Why don't we throw it out to the group
and see how everyone copes?

06:16.125 --> 06:19.170
I'm partial to red wine and denial.

06:21.089 --> 06:25.134
A Hungry-Man frozen dinner
and a hungry man from Tinder.

06:26.761 --> 06:29.389
Okay, none of those
are healthy coping  mechanisms.

06:29.472 --> 06:31.933
I need something stronger
than just grounding.

06:32.016 --> 06:33.559
My go-to is the stop sign.

06:33.643 --> 06:35.686
Like when I found out
that Gina was cheating on me,

06:35.770 --> 06:36.687
and I lost it.

06:36.771 --> 06:39.899
I found myself standing
over a pile of her clothes,

06:39.982 --> 06:41.609
ready to set them on fire.

06:41.943 --> 06:44.987
Well, I hope in that moment,
you asked yourself what was real.

06:45.071 --> 06:46.531
I did, and the answer was

06:46.614 --> 06:49.325
a can of gas in this hand
and a book of matches in the other.

06:51.285 --> 06:52.787
-But then...
-Ay, thank god!

06:54.080 --> 06:57.125
I pictured a big red stop sign,
and it made me think,

06:57.208 --> 07:00.378
"Do I really want to go all
Lisa 'Left Eye' Lopes on her stuff?"

07:04.215 --> 07:05.967
The answer was still yes, but I didn't.

07:07.844 --> 07:10.388
I am so glad you had a moment of clarity.

07:10.471 --> 07:14.350
Yeah, because I'm too pretty for jail.
[chuckles]

07:14.434 --> 07:16.227
I mean, look at this.

07:17.520 --> 07:20.356
I tried the stop sign the other day
when this thing happened with Mateo.

07:20.440 --> 07:21.274
Your boyfriend?

07:21.357 --> 07:23.067
If you're thinking
about checking his phone,

07:23.151 --> 07:24.569
that's a sign to check his phone.

07:24.652 --> 07:26.154
No, that's not it,

07:26.237 --> 07:28.489
and we're still trying
to figure out what we are.

07:29.031 --> 07:30.783
He's getting real comfortable, though.

07:30.867 --> 07:32.243
[sighs]

07:32.326 --> 07:34.328
I could just stay like this forever.

07:44.255 --> 07:47.383
I signed us up for joint checking.
It's called a handcuff account.

07:47.467 --> 07:48.509
[Penelope gasps]

07:50.761 --> 07:52.305
Oh, thanks.

07:53.222 --> 07:54.348
Hey, babe,

07:54.974 --> 07:56.851
you mind grabbing me something
from the fridge?

07:56.934 --> 07:57.810
Oh, wait.

07:58.644 --> 08:00.313
I can get it myself
'cause I live here now.

08:04.400 --> 08:08.070
Hey, what do you say we go have competent
but unspectacular sex?

08:13.576 --> 08:15.661
Not all techniques work for all people.

08:15.745 --> 08:17.872
Not all boyfriends work for all people.

08:17.955 --> 08:19.665
Oh, no, he's great.

08:19.749 --> 08:20.958
I mean, he's nice.

08:21.751 --> 08:23.461
You know, he's a really good guy.

08:24.670 --> 08:25.922
That bad, huh?

08:27.131 --> 08:29.133
Penelope, it does sound like

08:29.217 --> 08:32.470
you don't lean on your romantic partner
for emotional support.

08:32.553 --> 08:34.055
Romantic partner?

08:34.138 --> 08:37.266
More like "I need someone
to watch House Hunters with" partner.

08:38.809 --> 08:42.230
You should all have people you can turn to
in moments of emotional distress.

08:43.147 --> 08:45.274
Well, sometimes, I talk myself down.

08:46.025 --> 08:48.069
But when that doesn't work, I turn to...

08:48.152 --> 08:50.321
And I cannot believe
I'm about to admit this.

08:50.404 --> 08:51.364
...Schneider.

08:52.823 --> 08:54.158
You bone that dude?

08:54.242 --> 08:55.117
No!

08:59.163 --> 09:02.959
Look, I know it's hard to believe,
but Schneider is oddly calming.

09:03.167 --> 09:04.293
Like white noise.

09:05.419 --> 09:07.088
The whitest of noises.

09:08.548 --> 09:12.134
I know he's a privileged, hipster,
clueless man-baby

09:12.218 --> 09:14.512
who thinks he's Latino
but still pronounces the H in "hola,"

09:14.595 --> 09:15.429
but he gets me.

09:17.640 --> 09:19.225
We have a system, you know.

09:19.308 --> 09:22.562
When I start to spiral, I text him.
He talks me through it.

09:22.645 --> 09:24.855
Like the other day
when I was taking a practice test.

09:28.985 --> 09:30.152

-I got one more question left.
-No.

How cool is this?

Me taking my practice SAT test.

09:41.872 --> 09:43.249

09:43.332 --> 09:44.917

09:48.921 --> 09:50.756

It's an a capella singing group
that's all male...

10:00.766 --> 10:02.643
until I get there.

10:03.227 --> 10:05.896
I'm gonna go check my test scores.
I love tests!

10:07.189 --> 10:08.899
Wow! Okay. [laughs]

10:09.483 --> 10:12.570
Ooh, yes! I think I did pretty good too.

13:45.199 --> 13:46.408
And remember,

13:46.492 --> 13:51.831
anxiety is always rooted in something,
and it tends to run in families.

14:01.841 --> 14:04.218
Remember we went to the park last weekend,

14:04.301 --> 14:07.221
and there were so many mosquitoes
swarming everywhere?

14:07.304 --> 14:09.765
I think they had the Zikas.

14:10.391 --> 14:12.560
And now, we have the Zikas.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.312
Oh, okay, Mami, good night.

14:15.396 --> 14:18.858

on a kitchen cabinet,

14:21.443 --> 14:25.781
We should not have let her go to sleep.
If she has a concussion, she will die.

14:25.865 --> 14:26.907
I went to check on her.

14:26.991 --> 14:28.742

Too relaxed.

15:03.569 --> 15:05.154

15:06.780 --> 15:10.367
I wonder if meditation would help your mom
with her anxiety.

15:10.784 --> 15:12.161
It certainly helped you.

15:12.244 --> 15:14.330
Oh, believe me. I've tried,

15:14.413 --> 15:17.082

that I should pray instead.

Hey, prayer works.
I always get a good parking space.

15:22.129 --> 15:23.756
You know, prayer works for her.

15:25.007 --> 15:27.009

15:33.349 --> 15:38.395
Pero today, I need a little favor
from you, please.

15:39.396 --> 15:42.775
Give Lupita a little extra help.

15:43.651 --> 15:48.447
You know that Berto and I came
to this country in search of freedom

15:48.530 --> 15:51.617
and for our children
to pursue their dreams.

15:52.368 --> 15:54.620
And Lupita is doing this.

15:55.454 --> 15:57.623
I am so proud of her.

15:59.583 --> 16:03.420
Obviously, I cannot tell her.
Otherwise, she will get lazy.

16:05.297 --> 16:10.302
Pero please,
give her all the strength she needs

16:10.386 --> 16:11.720
to achieve her dream.

16:13.055 --> 16:14.139
You do this,

16:15.140 --> 16:17.476

for your kids.

Oh, no,
they don't know about my great shame.

16:40.582 --> 16:41.834
Hold on. What?

16:41.917 --> 16:44.169
They don't know
you have anxiety and depression?

16:44.253 --> 16:46.505
No, I don't wanna freak them out
like that.

16:56.890 --> 16:59.435
All right. Ha-ha! Hilarious. I get it.

16:59.518 --> 17:02.646
But I have the weight of this whole family
on my shoulders,

17:02.730 --> 17:05.774
and I need them to believe that
they're being raised by a stable person.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.651
Wait, Penelope.

17:08.485 --> 17:13.157
Having anxiety and depression
does not make you an unstable person,

17:13.741 --> 17:15.659
but it can be hereditary.

17:15.951 --> 17:19.371
Elena or Alex could be exhibiting signs,

17:19.455 --> 17:22.499
and it often starts around puberty.

17:22.583 --> 17:25.794
Ay, puberty! Between pimples,
and the horniness,

17:25.878 --> 17:28.005
and suddenly sprouting a mustache,

17:28.088 --> 17:30.549
and I can only imagine
what Alex is going through.

17:32.968 --> 17:37.347
And if Alex or Elena are exhibiting signs
of anxiety or depression,

17:37.431 --> 17:39.975
they might not want
to open up to you about it.

17:40.059 --> 17:40.893
Okay, you know what?

17:40.976 --> 17:43.062
Let's just leave my kids
out of this, okay?

17:43.145 --> 17:44.563
They need to know you're human.

17:44.646 --> 17:47.149
Do they? Really?
'Cause I'm their mom.

17:47.232 --> 17:50.110
And I don't want them worrying about
things they don't need to worry about.

17:50.194 --> 17:51.653
That's my job, right?

17:51.737 --> 17:54.114
I don't bring stress. I take away stress.

17:54.198 --> 17:56.533
And I have a very calming energy,

17:56.617 --> 17:59.703
and I make everyone around me
very happy, okay?
