Dad, what's a Muppet?

00:59.809 --> 01:01.936
Well, it's not quite a mop,

01:02.020 --> 01:03.855
and it's not quite a puppet,

01:03.938 --> 01:04.939
but, man...

01:05.023 --> 01:06.858
(laughing)

01:06.941 --> 01:08.610
So, to answer your question,
I don't know.

01:08.693 --> 01:11.071
BART: Why'd they make
that one Muppet out of leather?

01:11.154 --> 01:13.782
That's not a leather Muppet.
That's Troy McClure.

01:13.865 --> 01:17.494
Oh, back in the '70s, he was
quite the teen heartthrob.

01:17.577 --> 01:20.705
Yeah. Who'd have thought he'd
turn out to be such a weirdo?

01:20.789 --> 01:22.123
What are you talking about?

01:22.207 --> 01:24.125
You know--
his bizarre personal life.

01:24.209 --> 01:27.587
Those weird things they say
he does down at the aquarium.

01:27.670 --> 01:30.131
-Why, I heard...
-Oh, Homer, that's just an urban legend.

01:30.215 --> 01:32.675
People don't do that
type of thing with fish.

01:32.759 --> 01:34.636
Troy McClure's
a perfect gentleman

01:34.719 --> 01:37.388
like Bing Crosby or J.F.K.

01:37.472 --> 01:40.141
I wonder where Troy is now?

01:46.898 --> 01:49.150
TROY: Hey, these guys
are all over the road.

01:49.234 --> 01:50.568
-(siren blaring)
-(animal yelping)

01:55.281 --> 01:57.158
All right, Captain Rush-Rush.

01:57.242 --> 01:58.785
Out of the car. Ow!

01:58.868 --> 02:01.788
Oh, I'm seeing stars here.

02:01.871 --> 02:03.081
No, just one.

02:03.164 --> 02:04.749
Hi, I'm Troy McClure.

02:04.833 --> 02:06.209
You may remember me
from such films as

02:06.292 --> 02:08.169
<i>The Greatest Story Ever Hulaed</i>

02:08.253 --> 02:10.380
and <i>They Came</i>
<i>to Burgle Carnegie Hall.</i>

02:10.463 --> 02:12.340
Uh... 'fraid not.

02:12.423 --> 02:13.591
License, please.

02:15.385 --> 02:17.679
Says here you need
corrective lenses.

02:17.762 --> 02:19.806
Put those glasses on, mister.

02:19.889 --> 02:22.225
You wouldn't ask
a handsome man like me

02:22.308 --> 02:23.309
to wear glasses.

02:23.393 --> 02:25.979
It'd be a crime against nature.

02:26.062 --> 02:28.022
(groans)

02:28.106 --> 02:31.526
Gaa! Well, they do kind of
make you look like a nerd.

02:31.609 --> 02:35.029
Tell you what, just go down to the D.M.V.
tomorrow and try to pass that eye test.

02:35.113 --> 02:39.033
I'll tear up this ticket but I'm still
going to have to ask you for a bribe.

02:42.662 --> 02:45.540
Hello, Marge. Hello, Marge.

02:45.623 --> 02:47.792
How come no Chippendales dancers

02:47.876 --> 02:50.336
ever come in to renew
their licenses?

02:50.420 --> 02:51.796
They carpool.

02:51.880 --> 02:53.131
That's the problem.

02:55.008 --> 02:58.428
Hey, I came here
to get this revoked.

02:59.637 --> 03:00.555
Troy McClure?

03:00.638 --> 03:01.890
I thought he disappeared

03:01.973 --> 03:03.516
after that scandal
at the aquarium.

03:03.600 --> 03:06.477
Hey, I thought you said
Troy McClure was dead.

03:06.561 --> 03:09.731
No, what I said was he
sleeps with the fishes.

03:09.814 --> 03:11.941
-You see...
-Uh, Tony, please, no.

03:12.025 --> 03:14.152
I just ate a whole plate
of dingamagoo.

03:15.778 --> 03:18.823
Whoa! Troy McClure!

03:24.162 --> 03:25.997
Oh..! Hello, beautiful.

03:26.080 --> 03:29.375
John Law tells me I might need
to wear these glasses.

03:29.459 --> 03:32.754
You? Nonsense.
You're Troy McClure.

03:32.837 --> 03:36.216
I remember you from such
films as <i>Meet Joe Blow</i>

03:36.299 --> 03:39.552
and <i>Give My Remains</i>
<i>to Broadway.</i>

03:39.636 --> 03:41.304
Stars like you
don't need glasses.

03:43.348 --> 03:45.141
Yech!

03:45.225 --> 03:46.809
Now, Mr. McClure,

03:46.893 --> 03:48.394
would you like to take off
those glasses

03:48.478 --> 03:49.896
and read the top line?

03:51.981 --> 03:54.108
Uh... "W"

03:54.192 --> 03:55.777
seven...

03:55.860 --> 03:57.528
star, pound...

03:57.612 --> 03:58.821
duh...

03:58.905 --> 04:01.699
Look, Miss Bouvier.

04:01.783 --> 04:04.452
As an actor, I depend on
my remarkable looks.

04:06.579 --> 04:09.165
If you could find it
in your heart to pass me,

04:09.249 --> 04:11.167
I'm sure I could find
some way to repay you.

04:11.251 --> 04:12.961
(gulping)
Mubble.

04:13.044 --> 04:15.213
Say, by buying you dinner?

04:18.967 --> 04:21.219
That took a lot of class.

04:26.349 --> 04:28.893
All these celebrities on
the walls-- I just know

04:28.977 --> 04:31.396
a big star like you
is up there somewhere.

04:31.479 --> 04:34.565
Uh, yes, I'm over there.

04:34.649 --> 04:36.401
Selma (grunting):
Hmm...

04:36.484 --> 04:37.819
Hmm?

04:37.902 --> 04:39.862
Hm-mmm.

04:40.989 --> 04:42.573
-Ohm...
-(yowls)

04:44.450 --> 04:46.869
So, working at the D.M.V.
must be very interesting.

04:46.953 --> 04:50.248
Well, uh, I think I'm getting
repetitive stress disorder

04:50.331 --> 04:52.208
from scratching my butt all day.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.627
(clearing throat)

04:54.711 --> 04:57.672
Being a huge movie star
must be good, too.

04:57.755 --> 04:59.465
What are you
working on now?

04:59.549 --> 05:01.718
I've been reading
a lot of scripts lately.

05:01.801 --> 05:04.637
You know, it's a lot cheaper
than going to the movies.

05:09.392 --> 05:12.562
Well, thanks for holding up
your end of the bargain.

05:12.645 --> 05:13.855
I had a pretty good time.

05:13.938 --> 05:15.023
Yeah, me too.

05:15.106 --> 05:16.399
You need a ride somewhere?

05:16.482 --> 05:17.942
Hey, get a load of this.

05:18.026 --> 05:19.527
Troy McClure
and what looks like a date.

05:22.405 --> 05:23.781
Here you go, boys.

05:23.865 --> 05:25.616
A little something
for Page One.

05:30.204 --> 05:32.582
Hey, Homer, isn't this
your sister-in-law

05:32.665 --> 05:34.125
on a date
with Troy McClure?

05:34.208 --> 05:35.293
Troy McClure.

05:35.376 --> 05:36.919
He's a washed-up movie star.

05:37.003 --> 05:39.380
He could be dating
washed-up supermodels.

05:39.464 --> 05:41.049
Well, I don't know.

05:41.132 --> 05:43.051
Maybe those rumors
about his fish fetish

05:43.134 --> 05:44.469
weren't true after all.

05:44.552 --> 05:46.262
Ah, this changes
everything.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.473
I'd pay to see him
in a movie now.

05:48.556 --> 05:49.849
If only that
were possible.

05:53.936 --> 05:55.355
(phone ringing)

05:55.438 --> 05:57.648
<i>Troy, my man,</i>
<i>it's MacArthur Parker.</i>

05:57.732 --> 05:59.317
MacArthur Parker, the agent?

05:59.400 --> 06:01.069
MacArthur Parker, my agent?

06:01.152 --> 06:02.653
Just checking in, my friend.

06:02.737 --> 06:04.655
So, how's my favorite client?

06:04.739 --> 06:06.491
We haven't spoken
in eight years.

06:06.574 --> 06:09.535
Yes. So, I saw
the papers today, Troy.

06:09.619 --> 06:11.079
Looking good.

06:11.162 --> 06:12.497
That wholesome stuff
really helps

06:12.580 --> 06:14.123
when I'm trying
to find you work.

06:14.207 --> 06:16.417
You haven't found me work
in 12 years.

06:16.501 --> 06:18.753
Oh, you...
Uh, jury duty is work.

06:18.836 --> 06:21.089
And, listen,
you keep getting seen in public

06:21.172 --> 06:23.383
with human females,
and I can get you work

06:23.466 --> 06:24.842
in the entertainment industry.

06:26.719 --> 06:29.389
Hey...

06:32.016 --> 06:35.311
Hello, Selma Bouvier?
It's Troy McClure.

06:35.395 --> 06:37.021
You may remember me
from such dates

06:37.105 --> 06:38.564
as last night's dinner.

06:40.733 --> 06:44.237
That's right, boys,
Troy's back from the gutter

06:44.320 --> 06:46.656
and he's brought
someone with him.

06:46.739 --> 06:48.366
(theatrical laughter)

06:48.449 --> 06:50.076
That's too funny.

06:50.159 --> 06:52.662
I can't remember when I've heard
a funnier anecdote.

06:52.745 --> 06:54.539
Okay, now, you tell one.

06:54.622 --> 06:56.707
Well, not much happens to me,

06:56.791 --> 07:00.128
but I once had dinner
with a movie star,

07:00.211 --> 07:03.589
and it was the most wonderful
night of my life.

07:03.673 --> 07:05.883
Really?
Who was it, George Segal?

07:05.967 --> 07:07.343
I hear he plays the banjo.

07:09.095 --> 07:10.847
Um, yeah...

07:10.930 --> 07:12.140
(gasping)

07:12.223 --> 07:14.642
(crowd murmurs)

07:14.725 --> 07:17.520
Excuse me, I ordered a Zima,
not emphysema.

07:17.603 --> 07:19.730
Please, don't smoke
in our restaurant.

07:19.814 --> 07:22.442
We don't serve
contemporary California cuisine

07:22.525 --> 07:23.776
in your lungs.

07:26.404 --> 07:29.699
Troy, uh, I'm sorry
I ruined our evening.

07:29.782 --> 07:31.909
I have to go now.

07:31.993 --> 07:33.453
Oh, my God.

07:33.536 --> 07:35.746
(labored breathing)

07:35.830 --> 07:40.001
Oh, God, I'm such a fool.

07:40.084 --> 07:43.212
Got a light?

07:47.633 --> 07:50.511
(both coughing)

07:50.595 --> 07:52.847
Oh...

07:54.891 --> 07:57.101
Sounds like you're really
falling for him.

07:57.185 --> 07:59.896
What's the matter,
I'm not fun enough for you?

07:59.979 --> 08:02.482
Patty. Go on, Selma,
tell me more.

08:02.565 --> 08:05.735
I don't want to jinx it, Marge,
but this could be it.

08:05.818 --> 08:07.528
He asked me out again
this Friday.

08:07.612 --> 08:08.905
He's taking me
to a special screening

08:08.988 --> 08:09.864
of his latest film.

08:16.871 --> 08:19.916
You know,
smoke actually smells good

08:19.999 --> 08:21.834
when it's coming
out of you.

08:21.918 --> 08:22.919
Oh, I'm all out.

08:23.002 --> 08:25.505
Here. Try one of my cigars.

08:29.217 --> 08:30.384
Mmm.

08:33.429 --> 08:36.807
My God, it's like
five cigarettes at once!

08:36.891 --> 08:40.520
Oh. My head is swimming.

08:40.603 --> 08:41.979
That's not cigars, baby.

08:42.063 --> 08:44.065
That's love.

08:44.148 --> 08:45.983
(echoing movie dialogue)
No longer canst I

08:46.067 --> 08:48.152
conceal my love,
my wimpled turtledove.

08:48.236 --> 08:49.987
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

08:50.071 --> 08:52.323
O princess fair,
wilst thou grant me

08:52.406 --> 08:54.158
thine dainty hoof in marriage?

08:54.242 --> 08:57.578
Oh, Troy, I will!

09:01.165 --> 09:03.334
Mmm, mmm... Whoa.

09:03.417 --> 09:04.585
Just a second, baby.

09:05.962 --> 09:07.380
-Mmm, mmm...
-Mmm, mmm...

SELMA:
Make sure my iguana's okay.

09:49.338 --> 09:51.507
Selma, Jub Jub
is fantastic.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.884
He's everywhere
you want to be.

09:53.968 --> 09:55.761
Welcome to your
new home, baby.

09:55.845 --> 09:57.263
It's fantastic!

10:01.225 --> 10:02.768
Garbage collection is Monday.

10:02.852 --> 10:04.395
If you want to throw out a box,
you have to cut it up.

10:04.478 --> 10:05.813
It's so modern...

10:05.896 --> 10:07.315
it's ultramodern.

10:07.398 --> 10:09.650
Like living in
the not-too-distant future.

10:09.734 --> 10:11.777

10:11.861 --> 10:14.488

10:14.572 --> 10:16.324
Oh... okay.

10:16.407 --> 10:18.784

12:41.927 --> 12:45.264
Thank you.
It's great to be back.

12:45.347 --> 12:47.224
I just want to say,
I wouldn't be here

12:47.308 --> 12:49.643
without the support
of a very special lady,

12:49.727 --> 12:51.896
my always outrageous
fiancée, Selma.

12:51.979 --> 12:53.481
Take a bow, Sugar Beet.

12:53.564 --> 12:55.983
Oh, well. Thank you.

12:56.066 --> 12:57.735
Down in front!

13:00.946 --> 13:03.115
My good looks paid
for that pool,

13:03.199 --> 13:04.909
and my talent filled it
with water.

13:04.992 --> 13:06.952
Hi, I'm Troy McClure,
your future uncle.

13:07.036 --> 13:09.538
Hi. I remember you
from such filmstrips

13:09.622 --> 13:12.958
as <i>Locker Room Towel Fight:</i>
<i>The Blinding of Larry Driscoll.</i>

13:13.042 --> 13:16.337
You know, I was one of the first
to speak out against horseplay.

13:16.420 --> 13:18.756
-Uh-huh.
-Remember when we were kids,

13:18.839 --> 13:22.092
we used to dream
about our ideal husbands?

13:22.176 --> 13:26.764
Who knew the dream
would come true for one of us?

13:26.847 --> 13:29.558
Oh, come on.
Guess which one?

13:29.642 --> 13:32.144
I know, I know.
It's Selma, right?

13:32.228 --> 13:35.231
TROY (slurring words):
Yeah. It's a good idea, Homer,

13:35.314 --> 13:38.943
but they've already made some
movies about World War II.

13:39.026 --> 13:40.861
Ah, hell.

13:40.945 --> 13:42.947
Well, what about Dracula?

13:43.030 --> 13:45.825
Homer, I'm really touched
you invited me out on the town.

13:45.908 --> 13:48.619
You're going to be
a four-star brother-in-law.

13:48.702 --> 13:51.705
Troy, buddy, I got to know.

13:51.789 --> 13:53.332
What's a great guy like you

13:53.415 --> 13:55.668
want to marry a guy like Selma?

13:55.751 --> 13:58.212
-Come here, Homer.
-Okay.

13:58.295 --> 14:00.214
I'll let you in
on a little secret.

14:00.297 --> 14:02.216
(whispering)

14:02.299 --> 14:03.926
(laughing)

14:08.764 --> 14:11.725
And do you, Selma Bouvier
Terwilliger Bouvier

14:11.809 --> 14:13.644
take the fabulous
Troy McClure

14:13.727 --> 14:15.312
to be your lawful
wedded husband?

14:15.396 --> 14:18.649
-I already told you, yes.
-If anyone here knows why

14:18.732 --> 14:21.360
this couple should not be wed
in holy matrimony,

14:21.443 --> 14:25.698
let him speak now
or forever hold his peace.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.227
Now, smile.

14:55.311 --> 14:57.354
We're going to be

14:57.438 --> 14:58.314

15:04.695 --> 15:06.572
Hey, look what
I snagged, Marge--

15:06.655 --> 15:09.825
the candy bride and groom
from the wedding cake.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.785
(metallic crunching)

15:15.164 --> 15:16.457
Oh!

15:16.540 --> 15:19.293
Mmm... pointy.

15:19.376 --> 15:21.503
It was a beautiful wedding.

15:21.587 --> 15:23.964
I've never seen Selma happier.

15:24.048 --> 15:25.549
That reminds me.

15:25.633 --> 15:28.052
Troy said something interesting
last night at the bar.

15:28.135 --> 15:29.678
Apparently, he doesn't
really love Selma,

15:29.762 --> 15:31.847
and the marriage is just a sham
to help his career.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.474
Well, enough talk.
Let's snuggle.

15:33.557 --> 15:36.477
What? Oh, my God!

15:38.520 --> 15:40.481
HOMER: Marge, could you close
your eyes?

15:40.564 --> 15:42.775
I'm trying to sleep.

15:42.858 --> 15:44.234
There.

15:51.909 --> 15:54.244
This better be important.
It's my wedding night.

15:54.328 --> 15:55.663
I'm trying to sleep.

15:55.746 --> 15:57.289
Hey, sleep is for has-beens
my friend.

15:57.373 --> 15:59.875
and you're about to have
a very crowded schedule.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.252
This marriage scam is
paying off big time.

16:02.336 --> 16:04.254
-Phone for you.
-T. McC.

16:04.338 --> 16:06.799
Troy, darling, come to bed.

16:06.882 --> 16:08.968
I want to see
the Troy McClure I remember

16:09.051 --> 16:12.513
from such films
as <i>Make-Out King of Montana</i>

16:12.596 --> 16:14.682
and <i>The Electric Gigolo.</i>

16:14.765 --> 16:16.392
(low chuckling)

16:16.475 --> 16:18.268
Yeah, in a minute, darling.

16:18.352 --> 16:20.437
Well, she may be helping
my career

16:20.521 --> 16:22.564
but she's starting
to cramp my style.

16:22.648 --> 16:24.942
Oh, who cares?
The offers are rolling in.

16:25.025 --> 16:26.944
Paramount wants you
for a buddy comedy

16:27.027 --> 16:28.612
with Rob Lowe and Hugh Grant.

16:28.696 --> 16:31.865
-Those sick freaks?
-Okay, then get this.

16:31.949 --> 16:34.743
I think they want you
to play McBain's sidekick

16:34.827 --> 16:37.746
in, brace yourself,
the new McBain movie.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.915
McBain's sidekick? Hot damn!

16:39.999 --> 16:42.459
I'm going to Sea World!

16:42.543 --> 16:43.752
Selma...

16:43.836 --> 16:45.921
about you and Troy--

16:46.005 --> 16:49.800
we're not sure
he's... all he seems.

16:49.883 --> 16:50.843
Marge is right.

16:50.926 --> 16:52.386
He's wrong for you.

16:52.469 --> 16:54.638
Better you find out
sooner than later.

16:54.722 --> 16:56.598
Wrong for me? How?

16:56.682 --> 17:00.185
Oh, I get it.

17:00.269 --> 17:01.854
My sisters have come down

17:01.937 --> 17:03.814
with a case
of the green-eyed gazongas.

17:03.897 --> 17:06.025
I guess
I shouldn't be surprised.

17:06.108 --> 17:07.860
You're stuck
in a menial job

17:07.943 --> 17:09.737
you'll be doing ten
years after you die.

17:09.820 --> 17:11.196
And you're
tied down to a man

17:11.280 --> 17:13.407
who'd have to bathe
to be a slob.

17:13.490 --> 17:15.951
Selma, Troy doesn't
love you at all.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.911
He's only using you

17:17.995 --> 17:20.122
to squelch the rumors
about his bizarre personal life

17:20.205 --> 17:22.249
and further his career.

17:22.332 --> 17:25.461
(grumbles) You don't know
what you're talking about.

17:25.544 --> 17:27.629
I have to go now
and see Troy.

17:27.713 --> 17:29.882
(door opens, closes)

17:29.965 --> 17:31.633
(tires screech)

17:36.764 --> 17:39.767
Is this a sham marriage?

17:39.850 --> 17:41.852
Sure, baby,
is that a problema?

17:41.935 --> 17:45.272
You married me just
to help your career?

17:45.355 --> 17:46.940
You make it sound so sordid.

17:47.024 --> 17:48.400
Look, don't we have
a good time together?

17:48.484 --> 17:50.110
Yes, but--

17:50.194 --> 17:51.904
Don't you have everything
you ever wanted here--

17:51.987 --> 17:55.199
money, security, a big,
hot, flat rock for Jub Jub?

17:55.282 --> 17:57.910
But... don't you love me?

17:57.993 --> 18:01.163
Sure, I do, like I love Fresca.

18:01.246 --> 18:03.791
Isn't that enough?
The only difference

18:03.874 --> 18:05.793
between our marriage
and anyone else's is,

18:05.876 --> 18:07.753
we know ours is a sham.

18:07.836 --> 18:08.879
Are you gay?

18:08.962 --> 18:11.840
Gay? I wish.

18:11.924 --> 18:14.009
If I were gay,
there'd be no problem.

18:14.093 --> 18:16.970
No, what I have is
a romantic abnormality--

18:17.054 --> 18:19.556
One so unbelievable
that it must be hidden

18:19.640 --> 18:21.350
from the public at all costs.

18:21.433 --> 18:22.893
-You see--
-Stop.

18:22.976 --> 18:25.145
You're asking me to live a lie.

18:25.229 --> 18:27.272
I don't know
if I can do that.

18:27.356 --> 18:30.192
It's remarkably easy.

18:30.275 --> 18:34.613
Just smile for the cameras
and enjoy Mr. Troy's Wild Ride.

18:34.696 --> 18:36.615
You'll go to the right parties,
meet the right people.

18:36.698 --> 18:39.827
Sure, you'll be a sham wife,
but you'll be the envy

18:39.910 --> 18:42.079
of every other
sham wife in town.

18:42.162 --> 18:44.248
So, what do you say, baby?

18:46.166 --> 18:50.504
Tell me again
about Mr. Troy's Wild Ride.

18:58.178 --> 19:00.514
One day my lady Selma's
going to have a star

19:00.597 --> 19:01.849
right next to mine.

19:01.932 --> 19:02.975
So, watch out,

19:03.058 --> 19:04.977
Laszlo Panaflex.

19:05.060 --> 19:06.937
Yay! Yay! Yay!

19:07.020 --> 19:09.356
Tonight, all Hollywood's
wondering who'll be chosen

19:09.439 --> 19:11.400
to co-star
in the big new McBain picture,

19:11.483 --> 19:13.694
<i>McBain IV-- Fatal Discharge.</i>

19:13.777 --> 19:15.362
(rings)

19:15.445 --> 19:16.864
Oh, you watching?

19:16.947 --> 19:18.282
Mac, you gotta
get me that part.

19:18.365 --> 19:20.450
I will, but you got
to do something for me.

19:20.534 --> 19:23.120
Problem is, the big parts these days
are all going to family men.

19:23.203 --> 19:25.122
But I already
got married.

19:25.205 --> 19:26.790
Yeah, but for a role like this,
you got to pour it on.

19:26.874 --> 19:30.252
You and, uh, wife have
got to have a baby.

19:30.335 --> 19:32.129
A baby, eh?
What do I do?

19:32.212 --> 19:33.922
I'll send you over
a pamphlet.

19:34.006 --> 19:36.049
Listen, you can't buy
that kind of P.R.

19:36.133 --> 19:38.135
But you can get it for nothing
by having a baby,

19:38.218 --> 19:39.136
which by the way,
your insurance will cover,

19:39.219 --> 19:41.013
except for the deductible,

19:41.096 --> 19:42.514
which I'll reimburse you for
if you get the part,

19:42.598 --> 19:44.057
which you will,
if you have a baby.

19:44.141 --> 19:45.684
C'est Troy bien.

19:45.767 --> 19:48.145
Okay. Now listen.
Let's talk baby names.

19:48.228 --> 19:51.273
You can't use Montana,
Dakota or Florida.

19:51.356 --> 19:54.026
-They're taken.
-Mmm. Oregon?

19:54.109 --> 19:55.861
Oh, Pacific Northwest,
very hot.

19:57.988 --> 19:59.239
Having a child?

19:59.323 --> 20:01.074
That's a big step.

20:01.158 --> 20:03.368
You bet it is.
Think what it'll mean.

20:03.452 --> 20:06.079
Not just the McBain movie,
but maybe my own fragrance--

20:06.163 --> 20:07.581
Smellin' of Troy.

20:07.664 --> 20:11.752
It is probably
my last chance to be a mommy.

20:11.835 --> 20:14.671
-Cigarette, Mrs. McClure?
-You bet.

20:14.755 --> 20:17.257
From now on,
she's smoking for two.

20:21.428 --> 20:24.848
Ah, come here, Tiger.

20:24.932 --> 20:27.768
(sexy growl)

20:27.851 --> 20:29.937
Would you like some wine?

20:30.020 --> 20:31.647
Yes.

20:36.777 --> 20:38.570
(weak growl)

20:38.654 --> 20:41.240
Uh, why don't you
come over here

20:41.323 --> 20:44.326
and make yourself
more comfortable?

20:44.409 --> 20:47.246
No. Why don't you
come over here

20:47.329 --> 20:49.081
and make yourself
comfortable?

20:49.164 --> 20:50.707
I'm sorry.

20:50.791 --> 20:52.459
This whole concept's
foreign to me.

20:52.542 --> 20:54.294
Who knew a baby
would be so much work?

20:54.378 --> 20:58.090
Having a baby
isn't supposed to be work.

20:58.173 --> 21:00.259
It's supposed to be
an expression of the feelings

21:00.342 --> 21:03.053
we're supposed to have
for each other.

21:03.136 --> 21:06.348
Oh, like how we built
that snowman together

21:06.431 --> 21:07.975
in that Newport ad?

21:08.058 --> 21:11.019
Remember how alive with pleasure
they said we were?

21:18.068 --> 21:19.653
Look, I'm sorry.

21:19.736 --> 21:21.780
A loveless marriage
is one thing.

21:21.863 --> 21:23.407
We're not hurting anybody.

21:23.490 --> 21:26.159
But bringing a child
into a loveless family

21:26.243 --> 21:28.245
is something I just can't do.

21:28.328 --> 21:30.455
Oh, great. We'll adopt.

21:30.539 --> 21:32.124
I'll call my agent.

21:32.207 --> 21:33.542
He'll find some kid
who wants in on the deal.

21:33.625 --> 21:35.127
Good-bye, Troy.

21:35.210 --> 21:37.587
I'll always remember you...

21:37.671 --> 21:40.132
but not from your films.

21:48.765 --> 21:50.142
Come on, Jub Jub.

21:50.225 --> 21:51.810
Let's go home,

21:51.893 --> 21:54.438
and I'll microwave you
some nice roaches.

21:54.521 --> 21:56.148
(croaks)

22:01.778 --> 22:04.573
In a bold move that
has stunned Hollywood insiders

22:04.656 --> 22:07.242
newly divorced comeback kid,
Troy McClure

22:07.326 --> 22:09.036
has turned down
the supporting lead

22:09.119 --> 22:12.205
in <i>McBain IV</i> to direct and star
in his own pet project--

22:12.289 --> 22:16.209
<i>The Contrabulus Fabtraption</i>
<i>of Professor Horatio Hufnagel.</i>

22:16.293 --> 22:18.170
Will the gambit pay off?

22:18.253 --> 22:20.839
20th Century-Fox
is betting it will.
