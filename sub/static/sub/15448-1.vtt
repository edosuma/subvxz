00:17.499 --> 00:20.134
Disrobe, please,
and put this gown on.

00:20.201 --> 00:22.303
God,
it's cold in here.

00:22.370 --> 00:25.489
Now, fill this bottle.

00:25.557 --> 00:28.626
I-I don't think I can
fill the whole thing.

00:28.693 --> 00:31.729
You certainly
look like you can.

00:31.797 --> 00:34.181
Oh, thank you.

00:34.249 --> 00:36.684
I'll do the best I can.

00:36.751 --> 00:38.436
God, it's cold in here.

00:44.159 --> 00:45.759
I filled it up.

00:45.827 --> 00:47.245
That's a good boy.

00:47.313 --> 00:48.246
Thank you.

00:48.314 --> 00:50.014
Well, hand me the bottle.

00:50.082 --> 00:51.515
Could I hold onto it
a little longer?

00:51.583 --> 00:52.800
It keeps my hands warm.

00:54.737 --> 00:56.988
Hello?
Hello, is this x-ray?

00:57.056 --> 00:58.739
Step up here.
Stand still.

00:58.807 --> 01:02.594
Hold your breath,
and you will not speak.

01:02.661 --> 01:03.962
God, it's dark.

01:04.029 --> 01:06.447
Well, you're lucky,
'cause I'm ugly.

01:06.515 --> 01:09.416
Now, you will drink this down
without stopping.

01:15.474 --> 01:18.943
God, are you sure this isn't
the bottle I just filled?!

01:19.011 --> 01:22.430
No jokes, please.
All right, here we go.

01:23.965 --> 01:26.600
I'm upside down!
I'm turning upside down!

01:26.668 --> 01:28.102
Don't be alarmed.

01:28.170 --> 01:31.956
Now, I am just going
to insert this tube.

01:32.024 --> 01:33.424
Insert what tube?

01:33.492 --> 01:35.526
Don't insert-
I can't see! It's dark!

01:35.594 --> 01:38.279
Insert the tube where?
Where? Aah!

01:38.347 --> 01:41.549
That's where. Just let it
fill your lower abdomen.

01:41.617 --> 01:43.885
I can't hold it!
I can't hold it!

01:43.952 --> 01:46.220
Well, think of it
as a contest.

01:46.288 --> 01:49.273
I'm losing the contest!
I can't hold it!

01:49.341 --> 01:50.675
I tell you,
I can't hold it! Aah!

01:50.743 --> 01:55.096
<i>Aah! Ooh, schweinhund!</i>

01:55.163 --> 01:58.433
here's another fine mess
that I'm into, honey

01:58.500 --> 02:01.769
it's a little bit sad
and a little bit funny

02:01.836 --> 02:05.005
so listen if you want
to know the score

02:08.643 --> 02:13.247
it's a story that you've
probably heard before

<i>It's the same thing ali macgraw
had in love story.</i>

02:26.227 --> 02:28.429
No. What
you have is

02:28.497 --> 02:30.264
A toxic
blood disease.

02:30.332 --> 02:31.298
If I remember
correctly,

02:31.366 --> 02:34.301
Miss macgraw
had leukemia.

02:36.972 --> 02:39.841
Yeah, but I wind up
the same way...

02:39.908 --> 02:41.442
Dead.

02:41.510 --> 02:44.645
I didn't say that,
mr. Lawson.

02:44.713 --> 02:46.747
You didn't
have to say it.

02:48.617 --> 02:50.818
Don't be afraid
to say it, dr. Krugman.

02:50.886 --> 02:54.321
I've had the biopsies.

02:54.389 --> 02:56.824
Had the blood tests.

02:56.892 --> 02:58.759
I had the spinal taps.

03:00.228 --> 03:02.363
I've been to 3 doctors.

03:04.500 --> 03:06.200
How long have I got?

03:07.836 --> 03:09.704
It's really very
difficult to say.

03:12.273 --> 03:13.207
Try.

03:14.843 --> 03:17.578
It's difficult to say
because there's always a chance

03:17.646 --> 03:20.581
That there's some doctor
somewhere in some little lab

03:20.649 --> 03:23.183
Who may find a cure.

03:24.853 --> 03:27.722
Look, I'm not talking
about some miracle.

03:28.857 --> 03:32.393
Now, barring
some miracle...

03:33.862 --> 03:35.295
I'm a big man.

03:35.363 --> 03:37.798
I'm a strong guy,
you know what I mean?

03:37.866 --> 03:39.800
I can handle it.

03:39.868 --> 03:43.237
Now tell me...
How long have I got?

03:45.373 --> 03:46.473
I'd say you got a year.

03:46.542 --> 03:49.810
Oh, my god! No!

03:49.878 --> 03:51.846
I can't believe it!

03:54.382 --> 03:55.816
A year to live!

03:55.884 --> 03:58.252
I can't believe it!

04:00.822 --> 04:02.189
Oh, shit!

04:03.825 --> 04:06.493
What's the shortest?

04:06.562 --> 04:09.263
I've seen some cases
go in 3 months.

04:09.330 --> 04:11.699
Oh, shit!

04:15.837 --> 04:18.272
I got 3 months to live!

04:18.339 --> 04:21.175
You can say 3 months
if you choose

04:21.242 --> 04:25.212
To look at this thing
on its most negative level.

04:26.848 --> 04:30.284
That's where I choose
to look at it...

04:30.351 --> 04:33.287
At the most
negative level.

04:33.354 --> 04:35.289
That's where
I'm comfortable.

04:35.356 --> 04:37.224
The most negative level.

04:43.865 --> 04:45.800
I don't even feel sick.

04:45.867 --> 04:49.236
I feel sick, but I don't
feel like I'm dying.

04:50.872 --> 04:52.306
I feel lousy,

04:52.373 --> 04:55.242
But I don't feel
like I'm dying!

04:57.879 --> 05:00.748
People kept saying, "you're
losing so much weight.

05:00.816 --> 05:04.384
You look great."

05:04.452 --> 05:05.552
"god, you look great.

05:05.621 --> 05:07.421
You're losing
so much weight!"

05:10.826 --> 05:12.693
I do look good.

05:16.331 --> 05:18.265
Don't I look good?

05:18.333 --> 05:20.001
You look good.

05:20.068 --> 05:22.269
You look very good.

05:22.337 --> 05:24.271
I think
you're going through

05:24.339 --> 05:26.674
A period of remission.

05:26.742 --> 05:30.377
You know, people
frequently take on

05:30.445 --> 05:33.614
An almost
glowing quality...

05:33.682 --> 05:36.017
Just before they die.

05:40.522 --> 05:41.789
I don't understand

05:41.857 --> 05:45.292
Why you didn't call
your own doctor sooner.

05:45.360 --> 05:46.794
Surely,
you must have known

05:46.862 --> 05:49.396
That you were quite ill
for some time.

05:50.866 --> 05:54.802
I thought I discovered
a new way to lose weight-

05:54.870 --> 05:56.236
Throwing up.

05:57.873 --> 06:00.374
Throwing up's no good.
That's not good.

06:00.709 --> 06:02.593
You can't keep that up.

06:06.598 --> 06:08.699
It's gonna get worse,
isn't it?

06:08.767 --> 06:10.034
Yeah. Unfortunately,

06:10.101 --> 06:12.036
As the disease
progresses,

06:12.103 --> 06:14.638
The pain increases.

06:17.943 --> 06:19.043
I'm very curious.

06:19.110 --> 06:22.145
How do you
feel right now?

06:22.213 --> 06:25.549
I don't have
a headache today.

06:25.617 --> 06:27.651
I didn't have
one yesterday.

06:30.121 --> 06:32.556
My stomach is kind of bad.

06:32.624 --> 06:36.727
On a scale from 1 to 10,
it's about a 6.

06:36.795 --> 06:38.662
You rate the pain?

06:39.798 --> 06:41.065
That's interesting.

06:41.132 --> 06:42.499
That's really
interesting.

06:43.969 --> 06:45.502
You talk about pain...

06:46.638 --> 06:48.072
We had a guy-

06:48.139 --> 06:51.374
Came in this office
about 2-3 years ago...

06:55.814 --> 06:56.680
Never mind.

07:00.652 --> 07:04.688
Anyway, we have
wonderful drugs.

07:04.756 --> 07:07.691
We really have
miraculous drugs for pain.

07:09.594 --> 07:12.529
Really make you feel good.

07:12.597 --> 07:16.667
We'll give you
bone marrow injections,

07:16.735 --> 07:19.169
Perhaps tie off
some veins,

07:19.237 --> 07:20.570
And maybe...

07:20.639 --> 07:23.674
Maybe we'll remove
your spleen.

07:25.309 --> 07:26.677
No.

07:28.813 --> 07:31.682
No!

07:33.317 --> 07:36.253
You're not going
to remove nothing.

07:36.320 --> 07:39.757
I haven't had much dignity
in my life,

07:39.824 --> 07:43.260
But I'll have
some dignity in my death.

07:43.327 --> 07:46.263
I won't tell
anybody about this, see?

07:46.330 --> 07:49.266
I won't tell
my mother or my father.

07:49.333 --> 07:51.468
Not gonna tell
my little daughter julie.

07:51.536 --> 07:53.704
Nobody will know
that I'm going to die.

07:55.824 --> 07:56.757
Nobody!

07:56.825 --> 07:59.259
Damn! Sorry.

07:59.327 --> 08:01.328
You were saying.

08:01.396 --> 08:03.431
Just tell me one thing.

08:06.067 --> 08:08.936
What's it gonna be like
at the very end?

08:10.305 --> 08:13.006
Oh, well...

08:13.074 --> 08:15.543
You're really not
making it easy on me.

08:15.610 --> 08:18.361
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

08:19.898 --> 08:21.832
Ok. All right.

08:21.900 --> 08:23.834
In the final stages,

08:23.902 --> 08:26.003
You will be
hospitalized.

08:26.071 --> 08:27.838
You will experience

08:27.906 --> 08:31.842
A great deal of
shortness of breath,

08:31.910 --> 08:34.344
Severe cramps,

08:34.412 --> 08:37.847
And a great deal
of hemorrhaging.

08:37.916 --> 08:39.283
A great deal.

08:52.764 --> 08:55.866
You forgot to make
another appointment.

08:55.934 --> 08:56.800
Mr. Lawson!

08:57.936 --> 08:59.369
Mr. Lawson!

08:59.437 --> 09:02.940
here's another fine mess
I'm into, honey

09:03.008 --> 09:05.810
they won't cut me loose,
not for love nor money

09:05.877 --> 09:09.246
I'm a fighter, but
they got me on the floor

09:12.718 --> 09:16.253
don't believe
I'm gonna take this anymore

09:18.890 --> 09:22.960
here's another fine mess
I've stumbled into

09:23.028 --> 09:25.997
as sorry a state
as I've ever been to

09:26.064 --> 09:28.833
though it's difficult
for some to understand

09:28.900 --> 09:32.637
I'm gonna knuckle down
and take it like a man

09:32.704 --> 09:35.339
Pronounced dead by
a rotten corporation.

09:35.406 --> 09:39.259
I'm gonna knuckle down
and take it like a man

10:28.927 --> 10:31.561
Excuse me, excuse me.

10:31.629 --> 10:32.495
Excu-

10:35.300 --> 10:37.500
I got something
in my eye.

11:10.818 --> 11:12.486
Uggh.

11:43.718 --> 11:45.386
Hey!

11:45.453 --> 11:46.720
What did he die of?

11:46.787 --> 11:49.056
What, are you crazy?
Get out of here!

11:52.360 --> 11:53.593
Sir?

11:56.665 --> 11:59.066
Sir?

11:59.134 --> 12:01.769
Ma'am? Your beloved...

12:01.836 --> 12:03.070
What did he die of?

12:12.881 --> 12:15.115
You can have
a little dignity.

12:15.183 --> 12:16.583
I might have been
a customer!

12:16.651 --> 12:18.285
Yeah, in 2 seconds!

12:24.659 --> 12:27.260
Oh, god, the corpse
slammed against the door!

13:18.196 --> 13:19.529
Excuse me, kid.

13:19.597 --> 13:22.515
Do you know where
I can talk to a priest?

13:22.583 --> 13:25.318
I'm a priest.

13:26.471 --> 13:27.504
Oh.

13:27.571 --> 13:30.241
Really. I am.

13:30.308 --> 13:31.909
No, I believe you.
I think.

13:31.977 --> 13:33.893
It's on my
driver's license.

13:33.961 --> 13:35.412
That's all right.

13:35.480 --> 13:38.581
It's just that
you look so young.

13:38.649 --> 13:40.584
Young, yes.

13:40.651 --> 13:42.586
I made a decision
to serve god

13:42.653 --> 13:44.088
Right after I got
out of high school.

13:44.155 --> 13:46.406
Oh, that's nice.

13:46.474 --> 13:48.842
You got
the calling, huh?

13:50.495 --> 13:52.929
No, it's more
like a whisper.

13:52.997 --> 13:55.432
Nothing like
in the movies.

13:55.500 --> 13:57.000
I love movies.

13:59.004 --> 14:01.738
That's very interesting,
very interesting.

14:01.806 --> 14:06.710
Sir? If you'd like
an older priest...

14:06.778 --> 14:09.380
No, no, that's ok.

14:09.447 --> 14:12.616
Do they call you
"father," father-what?

14:12.683 --> 14:13.884
Benson.

14:13.952 --> 14:15.886
Father benson.

14:15.954 --> 14:18.889
I'd, uh...Like to make
a confession.

14:18.957 --> 14:19.890
Really?

14:19.958 --> 14:20.891
Yes.

14:20.959 --> 14:23.894
Gee, I haven't heard
many confessions.

14:23.962 --> 14:27.164
Matter of fact, you'd
be one of my first.

14:27.232 --> 14:28.432
Your first?

14:28.499 --> 14:30.567
In the field, I mean.

14:30.635 --> 14:34.405
We used to practice on
friends at the seminary.

14:34.472 --> 14:36.907
They all had such
crummy little sins.

14:36.975 --> 14:38.342
Barely worth confessing.

14:42.647 --> 14:45.082
Maybe you should
have a priest

14:45.150 --> 14:47.684
With a little
more experience.

14:47.752 --> 14:50.421
Father o'hara will be
here this afternoon.

14:50.488 --> 14:54.391
He's old.

14:56.494 --> 14:59.930
Look, I don't know
how to put this.

14:59.998 --> 15:03.867
This is going to be
my last confession.

15:03.935 --> 15:05.369
No!

15:05.437 --> 15:07.371
Yeah. You see,
I'm dying.

15:07.439 --> 15:08.305
No.

15:11.943 --> 15:16.380
You mean like-
in dead?

15:16.448 --> 15:17.381
Like in dead, yeah.

15:17.449 --> 15:18.983
Dying,
like in dead, right.

15:19.050 --> 15:22.919
Dying. Wow.

15:22.988 --> 15:27.358
A lot of people say
that father o'hara

15:27.425 --> 15:30.394
Looks just like
barry fitzgerald...

15:30.462 --> 15:31.895
You know, kindly,
twinkle in the eyes.

15:31.963 --> 15:36.033
I don't want to talk
to father o'hara.

15:36.101 --> 15:37.501
I want to talk to you.

15:37.568 --> 15:38.635
Me?

15:38.703 --> 15:41.271
Yes. I haven't got
that much time.

15:41.339 --> 15:44.841
I got to make
my confession now, ok?

15:46.644 --> 15:47.911
Certainly.

15:47.979 --> 15:48.845
Thank you.

15:49.981 --> 15:51.915
One other thing.
I have a hard time

15:51.983 --> 15:54.584
Calling you
"father," father.

15:54.652 --> 15:57.854
Call me dave,
if it is more comfortable.

15:58.990 --> 16:00.857
Dave. Thanks.

16:00.925 --> 16:02.292
After you...

16:03.428 --> 16:04.794
My son.

16:23.948 --> 16:26.816
Bless me, dave,
for I have sinned.

16:29.954 --> 16:30.887
Dave?

16:30.955 --> 16:34.558
Yes, I'm still here.

16:34.625 --> 16:37.127
Think I'd rather
call you "father."

16:37.195 --> 16:38.828
Fine.

16:40.465 --> 16:43.633
Bless me, father,
for I have sinned.

16:43.701 --> 16:47.003
How long has it been
since your last confession?

16:47.072 --> 16:50.840
Last confession
I made was...

16:50.908 --> 16:51.875
22 years ago.

16:51.943 --> 16:53.877
Boy, that's a long time.

16:53.945 --> 16:57.381
I was hoping one of us
would be good at this.

16:57.449 --> 16:58.882
What?

16:58.950 --> 17:00.250
I said-

17:03.888 --> 17:07.824
Why have you stayed
away from god's house?

17:07.892 --> 17:09.425
I don't know.

17:11.061 --> 17:14.763
I just stopped going
to church after I...

17:16.401 --> 17:18.835
I sort of
lost interest

17:18.903 --> 17:22.606
After I discovered
fu-sex.

17:22.673 --> 17:24.407
That's when
we lose them.

17:24.476 --> 17:25.909
I believe in god.

17:29.280 --> 17:32.583
Don't worry.

17:32.650 --> 17:35.319
We all lack faith
sometimes.

17:36.954 --> 17:40.924
Want me to tell
you something?

17:40.992 --> 17:42.626
Yeah.

17:42.693 --> 17:46.530
Every day...

17:46.598 --> 17:49.933
I have questioned
if I made the right decision,

17:50.001 --> 17:51.502
Becoming a priest.

17:51.569 --> 17:55.305
You see, becoming a priest,

17:55.373 --> 17:58.808
That can keep a person
from committing sin, sure,

17:58.876 --> 18:04.881
But it can't keep a person
from lusting after women,

18:04.949 --> 18:07.884
Craving alcohol,

18:07.952 --> 18:10.754
Dreaming of screwing
a business partner,

18:10.821 --> 18:12.822
Contemplating going out
every night-

18:12.890 --> 18:14.391
This is my dime.
Do you mind?

18:14.459 --> 18:15.392
I'm sorry.

18:15.460 --> 18:17.161
Thank you.

18:17.228 --> 18:19.829
Where was I?

18:19.897 --> 18:24.201
Um..."bless me."
that part.

18:24.269 --> 18:25.869
Oh, yeah.

18:25.936 --> 18:29.306
Bless me, father,
for I have sinned.

18:29.374 --> 18:30.807
Among
my grievous sins...

18:30.875 --> 18:34.578
Is jacking off
still a sin?

18:37.148 --> 18:38.882
I mean, now?

18:38.949 --> 18:40.884
Is that still your biggie?

18:40.951 --> 18:43.620
It is mine, man.

18:43.688 --> 18:48.091
Oh, I know.
I sell real estate.

18:48.159 --> 18:49.726
That's a sin?

18:50.861 --> 18:52.896
The way I sell it,
it is.

18:55.132 --> 18:57.834
Also...

18:57.902 --> 19:01.738
Also, I...

19:01.806 --> 19:04.974
Well, the whole time
I was married-

19:05.042 --> 19:07.444
When I should have
been a good father

19:07.512 --> 19:10.113
To my daughter-

19:10.181 --> 19:13.250
I was out copulating
around with other women.

19:19.257 --> 19:22.693
You...

19:22.760 --> 19:26.330
You committed adultery
during your marriage?

19:28.799 --> 19:29.999
Yes, I did.

19:31.168 --> 19:34.738
About...How many times?

19:36.807 --> 19:39.643
Well, let's see,
I was married 8 years.

19:43.581 --> 19:44.715
About 200 times.

19:44.782 --> 19:47.217
Jesus christ,
son of our lord,

19:47.285 --> 19:49.986
Blessed member
of the holy trinity.

19:50.054 --> 19:51.955
200 times?

19:52.022 --> 19:54.090
Wow! All right!

20:27.241 --> 20:28.608
How's it going?

20:28.676 --> 20:30.277
Fine.

20:30.345 --> 20:33.713
Where do they keep
the dying patients?

20:33.781 --> 20:35.648
Everywhere.

20:35.716 --> 20:38.452
I mean
the terminally ill.

20:38.519 --> 20:39.987
Do they keep them
in a special place?

20:40.054 --> 20:42.322
I don't know.
I ain't no doctor.

20:42.390 --> 20:43.823
I'm a singer.

20:43.891 --> 20:45.158
I just work here
part-time.

20:45.226 --> 20:48.328
you make me feel
like dancin'

20:48.396 --> 20:50.330
going to dance
the night away

20:50.398 --> 20:52.832
you make me feel
like dancin'

20:52.900 --> 20:55.118
going to dance
the night away

20:55.185 --> 20:57.120
That's real nice.

20:57.187 --> 20:59.122
Where are
the dying people?

20:59.189 --> 21:00.123
Why?

21:00.190 --> 21:02.359
'cause I'm dying myself!
Dead in a month.

21:02.426 --> 21:04.361
Don't touch the food.

21:04.428 --> 21:05.795
Oh, sorry.

21:05.863 --> 21:07.797
Check the third floor.

21:07.865 --> 21:09.799
Don't think any of
those folks are leaving.

21:09.867 --> 21:12.001
At least not through
the front door.

21:12.069 --> 21:13.002
Thanks.

21:13.070 --> 21:15.004
Can I use the stairs?

21:15.072 --> 21:16.306
Yeah, man.

21:16.374 --> 21:18.575
you make me feel
like dancin'

21:18.643 --> 21:20.910
going to dance
the night away

21:20.978 --> 21:27.517
Dr. Cambert, report to
intensive care immediately.

21:28.886 --> 21:30.019
What?

21:31.155 --> 21:33.757
Dr. Cambert...Never mind.

22:05.473 --> 22:06.973
Oh, my god.

22:07.041 --> 22:08.841
I'm not gonna end up
like that.

22:15.049 --> 22:16.983
Honey,
you can't come.

22:17.051 --> 22:19.219
I'm still in
intensive care.

22:19.287 --> 22:21.721
I sneaked out
to call you.

22:21.789 --> 22:24.724
Talk some of
that trash to me.

22:24.792 --> 22:26.726
I have an
important call.

22:26.794 --> 22:28.495
Buzz off, fella.

22:28.563 --> 22:30.997
Honey, you know
what I want.

22:31.065 --> 22:32.999
Talk that
lovey talk.

22:33.067 --> 22:35.001
Yeah, that's
good stuff.

22:35.069 --> 22:37.003
I hate to be rude, but
this really is important.

22:37.071 --> 22:38.505
Kiss my ass!

22:38.573 --> 22:40.507
Not you, honey.

22:40.575 --> 22:42.509
No, it's some guy.

22:42.577 --> 22:44.478
Oh, that's it!

22:44.545 --> 22:47.013
Don't make me
breathe too heavy!

22:47.081 --> 22:50.117
I don't get my pacemaker
till tomorrow.

22:50.184 --> 22:51.518
Yeah! What?

22:51.586 --> 22:53.753
Yeah, that's
the good part.

22:58.609 --> 23:00.410
I'll call you back.

23:02.546 --> 23:04.481
Thank you very much.

23:04.548 --> 23:05.915
You're welcome.

23:14.558 --> 23:16.426
Darlene, is marty there?

23:17.795 --> 23:18.995
Lunch?

23:19.062 --> 23:20.997
Hell, it's only 11:00.

23:21.064 --> 23:22.999
Where is he having lunch?

23:23.066 --> 23:25.502
I don't give a crap
what he said!

23:25.569 --> 23:27.804
Where is he?

23:27.872 --> 23:30.006
Darlene, I'll be dead
in 24 hours!

23:30.073 --> 23:32.942
Now where's
he having lunch?

23:34.812 --> 23:35.945
Casa ve-

23:38.549 --> 23:40.483
Marty, you're
my best friend,

23:40.550 --> 23:42.719
You're my lawyer,
and you're jewish,

23:42.786 --> 23:44.787
So you're
used to pain.

23:44.855 --> 23:47.289
I've got to talk.

23:47.357 --> 23:48.557
What about?

23:48.626 --> 23:49.826
About dying.

23:49.893 --> 23:50.994
Meaning what?

23:51.061 --> 23:54.363
Lying underground and
holding your breath forever.

23:54.431 --> 23:57.100
I know that. What's
this got to do with you?

23:57.167 --> 23:59.002
Everything!
I'm going to die!

23:59.069 --> 24:00.937
My doctor told me.

24:01.005 --> 24:03.940
They say anything
to keep you coming.

24:04.008 --> 24:05.441
No, marty.
Listen to me.

24:05.509 --> 24:08.410
I've got
a toxic blood disease.

24:08.478 --> 24:10.513
I've known for 3 months.

24:10.580 --> 24:12.015
My chest aches.

24:12.082 --> 24:13.516
Everything aches.

24:13.583 --> 24:16.185
I'm nauseous
all day and sick.

24:16.253 --> 24:18.187
Why didn't you tell me?

24:18.255 --> 24:19.689
I told you!

24:19.757 --> 24:22.258
Every time I'm in your office,
I throw up on your desk!

24:22.325 --> 24:23.526
Was that you?

24:23.593 --> 24:24.727
Yes!

24:25.863 --> 24:28.230
Marty, I'm going
to kill myself.

24:30.901 --> 24:33.036
Sonny, the enchilada
plate here-

24:34.371 --> 24:36.405
Did you hear what I said?
I'm going to kill myself!

24:40.878 --> 24:42.745
I really am.

24:45.115 --> 24:46.248
Sonny...

24:47.617 --> 24:50.153
You're the sweetest
guy I know.

24:50.220 --> 24:52.321
I'm so sorry.

24:52.389 --> 24:53.956
Forget it.

24:54.024 --> 24:55.958
It doesn't
bother me.

24:57.394 --> 24:58.828
That bothers me.

24:58.896 --> 25:00.763
I'm sorry, sonny.
I'm hungry.

25:00.831 --> 25:02.699
I haven't
eaten all day.

25:02.766 --> 25:05.768
Eat, if you can eat
when I'm dying.

25:05.836 --> 25:07.770
I don't have to.

25:07.838 --> 25:09.772
I have more time.

25:09.840 --> 25:11.273
True.

25:11.341 --> 25:12.775
Sonny.

25:12.843 --> 25:14.777
Jessie, julie...

25:14.845 --> 25:18.715
I will do anything
I can for them.

25:20.350 --> 25:21.784
What a guy.

25:21.852 --> 25:23.452
I appreciate it.

25:28.859 --> 25:30.292
Sonny.

25:30.360 --> 25:32.028
This is morbid,

25:32.096 --> 25:34.296
But we're
on the subject.

25:34.364 --> 25:36.298
In what manner...

25:36.366 --> 25:37.800
How do you-

25:37.868 --> 25:39.301
To do it?

25:39.369 --> 25:40.536
Yeah. How-

25:40.604 --> 25:42.304
I think...

25:42.372 --> 25:44.306
I think
sleeping pills.

25:44.374 --> 25:45.474
Ah!

25:47.111 --> 25:49.812
Most painless. Right?

25:49.880 --> 25:51.814
I don't have any,

25:51.882 --> 25:54.050
But I could
borrow some.

25:54.118 --> 25:55.317
Good.

25:55.385 --> 25:56.819
You got any?

25:56.887 --> 25:57.820
No.

25:57.888 --> 25:59.822
<i>I have sleep-eze.</i>

25:59.890 --> 26:01.758
<i>You can't o.D.
On sleep-eze.</i>

26:01.825 --> 26:05.361
You could, but
it would take 3,000.

26:05.428 --> 26:06.763
Yeah.

26:06.830 --> 26:07.930
Well...

26:12.836 --> 26:15.504
I'm gonna go by
and see mary ellen.

26:15.572 --> 26:18.507
But I'm not going
to tell her that-

26:18.575 --> 26:20.009
Oh, no.

26:20.077 --> 26:23.780
I'll just say I'll
be back sometime.

26:23.847 --> 26:26.048
Intelligent,
sensitive...

26:26.116 --> 26:28.517
That's what
we expect of you.

26:28.585 --> 26:31.520
You can't be dying, sonny!

26:31.588 --> 26:34.523
Don't tell me that!

26:34.591 --> 26:36.259
It can't be true!

26:36.326 --> 26:37.694
Honey, I'm...

26:42.332 --> 26:44.534
I'm sorry, baby.

26:44.602 --> 26:48.638
I shouldn't have
told you.

26:48.706 --> 26:51.007
Sonny, not now.

27:03.503 --> 27:05.071
Sonny!

27:05.139 --> 27:07.674
This could be
my last meal.

27:08.742 --> 27:11.194
Sonny, not now!

27:11.262 --> 27:13.429
Just making
a little joke.

27:13.497 --> 27:15.364
Well, it's
a terrible one!

27:16.767 --> 27:19.135
You're using your death.

27:20.271 --> 27:22.638
Yeah. You're right.

27:24.374 --> 27:26.876
I guess I was going
for a pity fuck.

27:30.881 --> 27:32.615
Sonny.

27:32.683 --> 27:38.321
Oh, my sweet sonny!

27:38.388 --> 27:40.056
Stupid idea.

27:42.159 --> 27:44.727
Oh, sonny,
what can I do

27:44.795 --> 27:47.697
To make you
feel better?

27:47.764 --> 27:49.598
I didn't think
you'd go for it.

27:49.666 --> 27:54.270
Oh, sonny,
I'll do anything!

28:27.270 --> 28:29.438
Noooo!

28:31.575 --> 28:33.510
Ha ha ha!

28:33.577 --> 28:34.944
Kitty, kitty.

28:35.012 --> 28:36.212
How was it in there?

28:36.279 --> 28:39.782
Hmm, felt good.

28:43.220 --> 28:45.821
Did you...

28:45.890 --> 28:48.624
Did you...You know?

28:50.310 --> 28:51.177
No.

28:54.948 --> 28:56.883
There was a moment there

28:56.950 --> 29:01.087
When you arched your back
and let out a little sigh...

29:01.155 --> 29:03.923
I thought maybe
you reached orgasm then.

29:06.226 --> 29:07.726
No.

29:07.795 --> 29:09.678
You know the moment
I'm talking about?

29:09.746 --> 29:13.016
When you had your back arched
and you-ohhh-let out-

29:13.083 --> 29:16.519
Sonny, I really don't
want a blow by blow

29:16.586 --> 29:18.221
Description of
our lovemaking.

29:18.289 --> 29:20.656
Takes everything
out of it.

29:20.724 --> 29:23.659
Yeah. Of course it does.

29:23.727 --> 29:25.895
Maybe you reached a climax
and didn't know it.

29:25.963 --> 29:28.331
Now, that's possible.

29:29.900 --> 29:31.734
No, it's not.

29:34.504 --> 29:35.905
Did you at least
like it?

29:35.973 --> 29:39.642
Well, of course
I liked it, sonny.

29:39.710 --> 29:41.711
I wouldn't do it
if I didn't like it.

29:43.113 --> 29:45.715
Yeah, that's the difference
between you and me.

29:45.783 --> 29:48.484
I've done it with people
I didn't like.

29:48.552 --> 29:50.720
I've done it with people
that nobody liked.

29:50.788 --> 29:52.638
Ohhhh!

29:55.275 --> 29:59.212
The least you could do
for a dying man is come.

29:59.279 --> 30:00.746
Oh, sonny!

30:00.814 --> 30:02.949
You don't let go.
You won't release.

30:03.016 --> 30:05.218
You've told me
that yourself.

30:05.285 --> 30:08.221
Oh, please, sonny.
What can I do?

30:08.288 --> 30:10.456
What any decent
woman would do.

30:10.523 --> 30:11.824
Lie to me!

30:11.892 --> 30:14.526
For goodness sakes,
I can't lie to you.

30:14.594 --> 30:16.729
That's why
you love me.

30:16.796 --> 30:18.231
That's the problem!

30:18.298 --> 30:20.532
That's always
been the problem!

30:20.600 --> 30:22.534
I love you more
than you love me!

30:22.602 --> 30:25.838
That's why you won't
move in with me!

30:25.906 --> 30:28.440
That's why you
won't come

30:28.508 --> 30:30.442
Or clean up
this kitchen!

30:30.510 --> 30:33.779
Sonny, why are you
doing this to me?

30:33.847 --> 30:35.381
Why are you saying
these things

30:35.449 --> 30:37.250
To make me
so unhappy?

30:37.317 --> 30:38.817
Because I'm unhappy!

30:39.253 --> 30:41.254
Seeing you is like...

30:41.321 --> 30:42.755
Being alone!

30:42.822 --> 30:44.156
Psss!

30:44.224 --> 30:46.759
Why do you keep
coming here?

30:46.826 --> 30:49.495
I say exactly
how I feel!

30:49.562 --> 30:51.497
Kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty.

30:51.564 --> 30:53.900
Why do you
come here?

30:53.967 --> 30:55.784
I gotta get
out of here.

30:55.852 --> 30:57.786
Where are you going?

30:57.854 --> 31:00.456
I got to see
julie before...

31:00.524 --> 31:01.891
Before what?

31:03.793 --> 31:06.729
Before she finds out
what happened.

31:06.796 --> 31:08.964
I thought
you hadn't decided

31:09.033 --> 31:11.234
If you would tell
julie or not.

31:11.301 --> 31:14.237
Look, I want to talk
to my daughter!

31:14.304 --> 31:17.240
Ok, all right.
Don't get mad.

31:17.307 --> 31:21.744
I just don't want you
to do anything crazy.

31:21.811 --> 31:23.246
Like what?

31:23.313 --> 31:25.048
I don't know.

31:25.115 --> 31:27.250
I just don't want you
to hurt yourself.

31:27.317 --> 31:29.252
Oh, don't be silly.

31:29.319 --> 31:31.254
What are you
talking about?

31:31.321 --> 31:33.256
Where's that gun
I gave you?

31:33.323 --> 31:34.257
Sonny!

31:34.324 --> 31:35.258
I'm just kidding.

31:35.325 --> 31:37.260
You're not funny!

31:37.327 --> 31:38.694
Yes, I am.

31:38.762 --> 31:39.762
Honey, I got to change.

31:39.829 --> 31:42.765
Julie doesn't like me
in ladies' clothes.

31:42.832 --> 31:44.767
Sonny, I...

31:44.834 --> 31:47.770
I hate
to let you go.

31:47.837 --> 31:49.205
Why?

31:50.574 --> 31:53.709
Am I gonna see you
back here tonight?

31:55.579 --> 31:56.946
Of course.

32:03.287 --> 32:04.720
Sonny...

32:04.788 --> 32:07.656
You promise you
won't do anything?

32:09.293 --> 32:10.726
Mary ellen...

32:10.794 --> 32:13.796
If I planned
to kill myself,

32:13.863 --> 32:15.598
Don't you think
I would tell you about it,

32:15.665 --> 32:21.571
So you would be riddled
with guilt and remorse?

32:21.638 --> 32:23.573
That's true.

32:26.210 --> 32:28.477
Sleeping pills?

32:28.544 --> 32:30.813
What do you need
sleeping pills for?

32:30.881 --> 32:33.149
Go on a good diet.

32:33.216 --> 32:34.917
Give up sugar
and caffeine.

32:34.985 --> 32:36.736
Don't lecture me!

32:36.803 --> 32:40.740
Don't lecture me from
classes that I paid for!

32:40.807 --> 32:42.742
I was trying
to help.

32:42.809 --> 32:45.745
You always relate
everything to money.

32:45.812 --> 32:47.980
A lesson I learned
from your lawyer.

32:48.048 --> 32:49.481
Get out!

32:49.550 --> 32:50.983
I'm sorry.

32:51.051 --> 32:53.185
I don't want to fight.

32:54.555 --> 32:55.421
What?

32:56.557 --> 32:58.758
I don't want
to fight with you!

32:58.825 --> 33:00.192
You don't?

33:00.260 --> 33:01.627
No!

33:02.763 --> 33:04.697
What's the matter,
wendell?

33:04.765 --> 33:06.699
I don't feel good.

33:06.767 --> 33:09.201
Try this, you'll
feel better.

33:09.269 --> 33:12.538
If you really
can't sleep,

33:12.606 --> 33:15.541
Why don't you borrow
some pills from your folks?

33:15.609 --> 33:17.310
They're
hypochondriacs.

33:17.377 --> 33:19.812
My folks are not
hypochondriacs!

33:19.879 --> 33:22.815
You always call them
hypochondriacs!

33:22.882 --> 33:25.818
They might have
some downers though.

33:25.885 --> 33:27.986
Why are you here?

33:28.054 --> 33:30.489
To discuss something
with julie.

33:30.557 --> 33:31.824
It's very important.

33:31.891 --> 33:33.992
Maybe I'll tell you.

33:34.060 --> 33:35.994
Will it depress me?

33:36.062 --> 33:37.496
God, I hope so.

33:37.564 --> 33:40.499
Would you save it
till tomorrow?

33:40.567 --> 33:42.501
Julie woke up
at 5:30 this morning

33:42.569 --> 33:45.238
Screaming that the shark
was after her again.

33:45.305 --> 33:48.006
I will never forgive you
for taking her to that movie.

33:48.074 --> 33:50.610
You know she's
afraid of the water.

33:50.677 --> 33:53.512
I'm sorry. She said
she wanted to see it.

33:53.580 --> 33:55.281
I was making her happy.

33:55.349 --> 33:57.516
She wanted to look
brave to you.

33:57.584 --> 33:59.017
You're so dumb.

33:59.085 --> 34:01.454
Don't say that!
I support you!

34:01.521 --> 34:03.456
The maid is napping.

34:03.523 --> 34:05.358
I support her!

34:05.425 --> 34:06.708
If you wake maria-

34:06.776 --> 34:08.193
We fired maria!

34:08.261 --> 34:09.962
It's another maria!

34:10.030 --> 34:11.463
Oh.

34:11.531 --> 34:13.966
Julie's screaming
woke her up, too.

34:14.034 --> 34:15.467
So maria started
screaming

34:15.534 --> 34:17.902
Because she thought it
was the border patrol.

34:20.040 --> 34:21.974
<i>Solamente cinco pesos.</i>

34:22.042 --> 34:24.476
<i>Con cinco pesos,
compra usted</i>

34:24.543 --> 34:26.846
<i>El bucket grande
de kentucky fried chicken.</i>

34:26.913 --> 34:29.414
<i>Y una botella
de coca-cola.</i>

34:30.583 --> 34:34.002
Jessie, you want to
hear about heartache?

34:34.070 --> 34:37.005
You want to hear
about heartbreak?

34:37.072 --> 34:38.674
You growing a beard?

34:38.741 --> 34:40.342
Yes, for 3 months.

34:40.409 --> 34:41.342
Why?

34:41.411 --> 34:43.612
Because
some mornings

34:43.679 --> 34:45.447
I don't have the
strength to shave.

34:45.514 --> 34:47.882
You should go
to a barber.

34:50.170 --> 34:52.603
You don't care
about me at all.

34:53.739 --> 34:56.442
Not since you
walked out that door.

34:56.510 --> 34:58.961
You threw me
out the door!

34:59.029 --> 35:00.729
With 2 hookers!

35:00.797 --> 35:02.898
One little mistake!

35:02.966 --> 35:06.068
I've paid
for it for 6 years.

35:06.135 --> 35:08.070
Out of
respect for you,

35:08.137 --> 35:11.707
The three of us

35:11.775 --> 35:13.075
Never laid
down on our bed.

35:14.377 --> 35:17.580
That's my date.
Please get out.

35:17.647 --> 35:18.747
No.

35:18.815 --> 35:19.682
Aaahh!

35:22.318 --> 35:24.086
Why don't
you drop dead?

35:24.153 --> 35:26.589
I'm working on it.

35:26.656 --> 35:28.423
<i>Buenos tardes.</i>

35:28.491 --> 35:30.092
<i>Tu es hermosa.</i>

35:30.159 --> 35:31.594
<i>Oh, grazie.</i>

35:31.661 --> 35:33.596
<i>Te es divinal.</i>

35:33.663 --> 35:34.597
<i>Ah, merci.</i>

35:34.664 --> 35:36.765
<i>Oh, merci.</i>

35:36.833 --> 35:38.100
<i>Una momento.</i>

35:38.167 --> 35:39.434
<i>¿si?</i>

35:39.502 --> 35:42.938
<i>No prestes au atencion
a ese schmuck.</i>

35:45.341 --> 35:47.442
Now, you be civil
or I'll kill you.

35:52.015 --> 35:56.051
I don't know how
to tell you this, but...

35:57.687 --> 36:00.122
I'm a dying man.

36:00.189 --> 36:01.757
<i>Senor,</i>

36:01.825 --> 36:03.492
<i>Yo no hablo ingles.</i>

36:05.629 --> 36:08.563
Son of a gun.
That's too bad.

36:08.632 --> 36:11.000
<i>Ok, vamanos.</i>

36:12.636 --> 36:15.570
I need to
talk to you.

36:15.639 --> 36:16.905
Let go.

36:16.973 --> 36:18.741
We need to talk.

36:18.808 --> 36:19.908
<i>Por favor,</i>

36:19.976 --> 36:22.577
<i>Esperas
en el auto.</i>

36:22.646 --> 36:23.912
Ok?

36:23.980 --> 36:25.080
<i>S'il vous plait?</i>

36:25.148 --> 36:26.381
Yeah. Ok.

36:26.449 --> 36:27.916
And fuck
the panama canal!

36:27.984 --> 36:29.084
Let go.

36:29.152 --> 36:31.754
<i>Are you going
to taco bell</i>

36:31.821 --> 36:33.588
For a cock fight?

36:33.657 --> 36:35.057
You are a racist ass.

36:35.125 --> 36:37.793
We're going to
a french restaurant.

36:37.861 --> 36:39.594
After that, we're
attending a seminar.

36:39.663 --> 36:41.263
Oh, boring, boring!

36:41.330 --> 36:42.765
Maybe to you, sonny,

36:42.832 --> 36:44.900
But I'm trying to
make my life better.

36:44.968 --> 36:47.169
It may not work,
but I'm trying.

36:47.236 --> 36:48.971
Where did you meet
this beaner?

36:49.039 --> 36:51.073
Beaner?

36:51.141 --> 36:53.742
I met this beaner in
the english class I teach.

36:53.810 --> 36:56.745
How nice. Teacher
takes out the student.

36:56.813 --> 36:58.147
A little tea
and sympathy-

36:58.214 --> 37:00.448
You're also
a sexist ass, too!

37:00.516 --> 37:01.884
You look 10 years
older than him!

37:01.951 --> 37:03.518
You look like
his chaperone!

37:03.586 --> 37:05.721
How dare you say that?
You're going with a girl

37:05.789 --> 37:07.556
Who probably still
wears a retainer!

37:07.623 --> 37:10.225
Listen to me!
I got to talk to you!

37:10.293 --> 37:11.727
If you don't get
out of my way,

37:11.795 --> 37:13.662
I'll give you
a karate chop.

37:13.730 --> 37:15.230
You wouldn't dare!

37:15.298 --> 37:17.032
You don't think so?

37:25.274 --> 37:26.709
Ok, sonny,

37:26.776 --> 37:29.144
Pull yourself
together now.

37:30.780 --> 37:32.147
Here we go.

37:37.787 --> 37:40.038
Are you going to go?

37:40.106 --> 37:41.039
Huh?

37:41.107 --> 37:43.042
Of course not.

37:43.110 --> 37:45.611
Last time you got up,
your chair was on fire.

37:45.679 --> 37:46.945
Don't yell!

37:47.013 --> 37:48.380
I'm not deaf!

37:49.515 --> 37:50.949
Oh, hello, dear.

37:51.017 --> 37:52.117
Hi, mom.

37:52.185 --> 37:53.618
Shave that thing off.

37:53.686 --> 37:55.620
I'm working on it.
I bought you some candy.

37:55.688 --> 37:56.789
Thank you.

37:56.856 --> 37:58.240
Hiya, pop.

38:01.310 --> 38:02.912
Hiya, pop!

38:02.979 --> 38:04.479
Who is it?

38:04.548 --> 38:06.582
It's your
only son.

38:06.650 --> 38:09.484
You never forget
the holy water.

38:09.553 --> 38:10.886
You hungry?

38:10.954 --> 38:12.922
I'm almost
out of milk.

38:12.989 --> 38:14.322
How's the art world?

38:14.390 --> 38:15.591
What?

38:15.659 --> 38:17.593
How's the art world?

38:17.661 --> 38:19.595
Boring, boring!

38:19.663 --> 38:23.599
What the hell else
can you do past 70?

38:23.667 --> 38:26.936
Sit and watch your
hands turn brown?

38:27.003 --> 38:28.938
I hope you can stay.

38:29.005 --> 38:31.540
We never talk.

38:31.608 --> 38:33.542
I can't stay long.

38:33.610 --> 38:36.244
Listen, I haven't
slept well lately.

38:36.312 --> 38:38.814
I need some
sleeping pills.

38:38.881 --> 38:40.316
Sleeping pills?

38:40.383 --> 38:43.052
We don't have
sleeping pills.

38:43.486 --> 38:45.054
You know damn well we got
enough sleeping pills

38:45.121 --> 38:48.924
To put the mormon
tabernacle choir in a coma.

38:50.126 --> 38:51.493
Help yourself, son.

38:52.629 --> 38:54.546
Thank you, pop.

38:54.613 --> 38:57.049
Take what you need,
but be careful.

38:57.116 --> 38:58.616
Don't take too many.

39:02.055 --> 39:03.989
Oh, god!

39:04.057 --> 39:05.423
A 9.

39:06.559 --> 39:08.493
Try those blue ones!

39:08.561 --> 39:10.996
They'll really put you
in la-la land.

39:11.064 --> 39:12.497
Wowee!

39:12.565 --> 39:14.499
I should
never have married

39:14.567 --> 39:16.501
An irishman
who drinks.

39:16.569 --> 39:18.436
Try finding one
who doesn't!

39:23.343 --> 39:24.442
My god!

39:27.580 --> 39:30.648
No wonder they put up
with each other.

39:32.418 --> 39:34.853
I don't like
this guy's colors.

39:34.921 --> 39:36.855
They're all the same.

39:36.923 --> 39:39.657
All day, I've been
painting 11, 11, 11.

39:41.094 --> 39:43.028
I'm sorry, ben.

39:43.096 --> 39:45.530
The store was
out of sad clowns.

39:51.121 --> 39:52.488
The blue ones...

39:53.623 --> 39:56.591
They'll really put
you in la-la land.

39:57.027 --> 39:58.961
Took place in south america

39:59.029 --> 40:02.297
In the rich wildlife area
along the kanani river,

40:02.365 --> 40:04.549
Creating
a vast man-made lake

40:04.617 --> 40:06.518
That flooded
the wildlife range.

40:06.585 --> 40:10.172
Pedro cabal
found this kinkajou

40:10.239 --> 40:12.557
Swimming over flooded treetops
that were once its home.

40:14.944 --> 40:17.529
Our orphaned baby otters
would have starved

40:17.596 --> 40:20.198
If we hadn't found them
near their den.

40:20.266 --> 40:21.800
I'll see
you two later.

40:21.867 --> 40:23.302
Good-bye, pop.

40:23.369 --> 40:24.403
Bye-bye, my boy.

40:24.470 --> 40:25.404
Good-bye, dear.

40:25.471 --> 40:26.571
Sure you're
not hungry?

40:26.639 --> 40:27.605
The meatloaf
is great.

40:27.941 --> 40:29.124
I'll have
to heat it up.

40:29.192 --> 40:30.726
Think you can
handle it, maureen?

40:30.794 --> 40:32.127
I didn't mean that.

40:32.195 --> 40:36.031
That's all right.
I'm...I'm not hungry.

40:36.099 --> 40:38.400
I'll see you later.

40:38.467 --> 40:39.334
Bye.

40:45.575 --> 40:48.877
With the ocelot safely back
at our camp compound,

40:48.945 --> 40:50.979
We patrol the lake
once more,

40:51.047 --> 40:53.282
Searching for signs of life.

40:53.349 --> 40:55.250
We had set up our base camp
on an island

40:55.318 --> 40:57.752
That gave us a good view
over much of the lake.

41:17.757 --> 41:19.058
I'm not paying
all kinds of money

41:19.125 --> 41:21.426
For my daughter
to learn smut.

41:21.494 --> 41:22.895
You're certainly not.

41:22.962 --> 41:26.065
Her bill hasn't
been paid in months.

41:30.469 --> 41:32.237
Nice outfit
for a striptease.

41:32.305 --> 41:33.605
It's from a
stage show.

41:33.673 --> 41:35.107
I saw it in the navy.

41:37.760 --> 41:41.429
Wear a coat over that.
Isn't it cold?

41:41.497 --> 41:43.231
It's 100 degrees out!

41:43.299 --> 41:45.734
I'd like to take off
this dumb hat.

41:45.802 --> 41:48.904
What's the matter?
It's cute.

41:48.972 --> 41:51.139
Why did we have to put
"daddy's girl" on it?

41:51.207 --> 41:53.575
Makes me sound like
a race horse.

41:53.643 --> 41:55.010
I'm not having
my daughter wear a hat

41:55.078 --> 41:56.444
That says "bitch" on it.

41:58.514 --> 42:01.182
Dad, why'd you bring me here?
I hate miniature golf.

42:01.250 --> 42:02.784
You loved it last time.

42:02.852 --> 42:05.120
That was 6 years ago.

42:06.689 --> 42:08.724
The game hasn't
changed that much.

42:08.791 --> 42:10.291
Castles are bigger.

42:10.359 --> 42:11.710
I've changed.

42:13.847 --> 42:15.280
I know you've changed.

42:15.348 --> 42:17.549
That's why I want
to talk to you.

42:17.617 --> 42:18.984
Sit down.

42:23.356 --> 42:26.825
Julie, I want to talk
to you about sex.

42:28.862 --> 42:32.297
If it's about sex,
I know plenty.

42:32.365 --> 42:34.299
Oh, you do?
Like what?

42:34.367 --> 42:37.702
I'm at the top of
my sex education class.

42:37.771 --> 42:39.838
I just got an "a" on
my paper on menstruation.

42:39.906 --> 42:41.640
How nice!

42:43.777 --> 42:45.394
How can I put
this delicately

42:45.461 --> 42:47.396
So you won't
be suspicious

42:47.463 --> 42:49.898
Of the opposite sex
for the rest of your life?

42:49.965 --> 42:51.400
You see,

42:51.467 --> 42:53.986
All boys,
and all men...

42:55.621 --> 42:57.555
Are rotten filthy beasts
who just want to get you

42:57.623 --> 43:00.092
In the sack and
then dump on you.

43:01.560 --> 43:04.696
That's the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

43:06.332 --> 43:08.033
Dad, why are you
telling me this?

43:09.803 --> 43:11.036
I'm going away
for a while.

43:14.073 --> 43:15.874
Maybe for
a long while.

43:17.777 --> 43:18.811
Julie...

43:18.878 --> 43:21.847
But I'm coming back.

43:23.933 --> 43:25.383
I am coming back.

43:28.804 --> 43:32.524
God damn it,
why are you wearing that?

43:32.591 --> 43:35.093
Why can't you
wear a coat over it?

43:35.161 --> 43:36.295
It's obscene!

43:36.362 --> 43:38.497
Take me home.

43:52.178 --> 43:53.745
I'm sorry
we had a fight.

43:56.549 --> 43:59.151
Me, too.

44:01.354 --> 44:03.355
Tell you what...

44:03.422 --> 44:05.958
Let's not be
mad at each other.

44:06.025 --> 44:08.126
Ever again.

44:08.194 --> 44:10.562
About today or anything
in the future.

44:10.629 --> 44:13.548
What do you mean?

44:13.616 --> 44:15.984
Well, in this old world,

44:16.052 --> 44:19.020
Sometimes things happen
we don't understand.

44:19.088 --> 44:20.922
You know?

44:20.990 --> 44:22.958
But years later when
we think about them,

44:23.025 --> 44:24.859
They make sense.

44:24.927 --> 44:28.279
I don't understand what
you're trying to say.

44:29.582 --> 44:30.883
That's good.

44:34.820 --> 44:35.888
Good-bye.

44:39.292 --> 44:40.893
Dad.
Yeah?

44:46.966 --> 44:48.967
Is this
a business trip?

44:49.035 --> 44:50.903
Yeah, it's
a business trip.

44:52.805 --> 44:55.407
Are you taking
mary ellen with you?

44:56.992 --> 44:57.992
No.

44:58.060 --> 45:00.428
Then who the hell's
gonna take care of you?

45:00.496 --> 45:02.130
Don't cuss!

45:02.198 --> 45:04.465
Wish I could go.

45:04.533 --> 45:05.967
Damn it,
don't say that.

45:06.035 --> 45:06.902
Why?

45:10.372 --> 45:12.240
Dad, what's wrong?

45:17.379 --> 45:19.314
Where are you going?

45:19.381 --> 45:21.817
Bakersfield.

45:24.887 --> 45:27.022
You sound funny.

45:27.323 --> 45:29.675
Like you're going
someplace awful.

45:29.742 --> 45:32.143
You ever been
to bakersfield?

45:35.597 --> 45:38.466
I know you haven't
felt well lately.

45:43.105 --> 45:46.041
You're going to
the hospital, aren't you?

45:46.108 --> 45:48.676
No! I'm not going
to the hospital.

45:49.946 --> 45:52.981
I'm not going
in the hospital.

45:53.049 --> 45:54.365
Swear to god?

45:54.433 --> 45:56.034
I swear to god.

45:56.102 --> 45:57.535
Cross your heart?

45:57.604 --> 45:59.537
Cross my heart.

45:59.606 --> 46:00.739
Hope to die?

46:03.542 --> 46:05.877
I hope to die.

46:05.945 --> 46:07.312
I'm glad.

46:09.949 --> 46:11.483
I'll miss you, julie.

46:13.453 --> 46:15.820
I'll miss you
more than anybody.

46:16.956 --> 46:20.892
You'll see me
when you get back.

46:20.960 --> 46:21.994
Yeah.

46:24.464 --> 46:25.830
I love you.

46:28.468 --> 46:29.901
You better go.

46:29.969 --> 46:30.835
Bye-bye.

46:41.314 --> 46:42.680
I love you.

46:48.504 --> 46:49.871
"wendell sonny lawson..."

46:51.840 --> 46:53.208
"love from mother."

46:58.047 --> 47:01.116
God, what an ass I had.

47:07.723 --> 47:10.208
You know, if I had been
4 seconds faster

47:10.275 --> 47:11.909
In the 100-yard dash,

47:11.977 --> 47:13.778
I would have been
all-american.

47:15.898 --> 47:17.466
Memories.

47:25.140 --> 47:28.109
Is this
the coward's way out?

47:28.177 --> 47:30.178
Of course.
That's why I picked it.

47:34.016 --> 47:36.117
Come on.

47:36.185 --> 47:38.386
Get on with it.

47:52.735 --> 47:54.202
That's a pretty one.

48:06.883 --> 48:10.968
God, sour-shit! Pah!
Shit! Ca-ca!

48:29.121 --> 48:31.155
God damn, they're right!

48:31.223 --> 48:32.957
You can't take just one.

48:45.871 --> 48:47.338
"lonely?

48:47.406 --> 48:49.340
"depressed?

48:49.408 --> 48:52.610
Contemplating suicide?"

48:52.678 --> 48:54.846
Ha ha ha!

48:54.914 --> 48:56.848
"don't do it.

48:56.916 --> 48:59.283
Dial 555-h-e-l-p."

49:02.588 --> 49:03.721
Why not?

49:06.859 --> 49:07.892
5-5-5...

49:10.195 --> 49:14.732
H-e-l-p.

49:16.535 --> 49:17.469
Hello.

49:17.536 --> 49:18.970
Hello. Help-

49:19.037 --> 49:21.138
Thank you for
calling help.

49:21.206 --> 49:22.640
Ma'am, listen,

49:22.708 --> 49:24.809
I'm doing
a terrible thing-

49:24.877 --> 49:26.811
To discuss problems
with you-

49:26.879 --> 49:28.980
I'm taking booze
and downers-

49:29.047 --> 49:30.982
All the lines are busy-

49:31.049 --> 49:32.484
It's very dangerous-

49:32.551 --> 49:34.819
This is a recording.

49:34.887 --> 49:35.920
Ma'am?

49:37.890 --> 49:38.756
Hello?

49:40.225 --> 49:41.092
Twat!

49:49.902 --> 49:54.105
I'm going to do it.

49:55.240 --> 49:57.108
God, what a mess!

49:59.411 --> 50:01.846
Look at all that color.

50:01.914 --> 50:04.782
It looks like
walt disney threw up.

50:17.229 --> 50:18.429
No.

50:47.976 --> 50:50.845
I never even had my own dog.

50:58.321 --> 51:00.121
It ain't working yet.

51:03.258 --> 51:04.793
Nothing's happening.

51:08.764 --> 51:10.598
Ha ha ha!

51:16.439 --> 51:17.806
A note.

51:19.442 --> 51:20.875
Oh, my god,

51:20.943 --> 51:22.811
I forgot the note.

51:24.947 --> 51:27.816
Who do I write the note to?

51:29.452 --> 51:31.386
Jessie.

51:31.454 --> 51:33.388
Uh...

51:33.456 --> 51:36.391
No, if I write it
to jessie,

51:36.459 --> 51:39.694
Mary ellen will be hurt.

51:40.863 --> 51:43.398
If I write it
to mary ellen,

51:43.466 --> 51:45.333
Jessie will be hurt.

51:46.469 --> 51:48.903
No matter who
I write it to,

51:48.971 --> 51:51.406
My mother
will be hurt.

51:51.474 --> 51:54.909
I could write it
to my father,

51:54.977 --> 51:57.846
But he probably
wouldn't read it.

52:02.918 --> 52:04.786
Who do I know...

52:07.423 --> 52:10.358
Who do I know
that's mature enough

52:10.426 --> 52:12.794
To handle
the suicide note?

52:21.937 --> 52:23.304
"dear..."

52:25.941 --> 52:27.308
"julie..."

52:31.614 --> 52:34.949
I'm so sorry.

52:35.017 --> 52:37.819
"daddy is so..."

52:39.955 --> 52:42.223
"so sorry."

53:16.208 --> 53:18.843
God damn son of a bitch.

53:18.911 --> 53:21.045
Hi.

53:21.113 --> 53:22.780
It's very interesting
the way you woke up cursing.

53:22.848 --> 53:25.083
A large percentage
of attempted suicides

53:25.150 --> 53:27.185
Wake up with
exclamations of hostility.

53:27.252 --> 53:29.253
Where am I?

53:29.321 --> 53:31.055
92% ask that.

53:31.123 --> 53:33.224
You're in la playa.

53:33.291 --> 53:34.992
The nut house?

53:36.128 --> 53:38.062
That's a cruel label.

53:38.130 --> 53:40.998
We prefer booby hatch.

53:42.134 --> 53:43.500
You a doctor?

53:43.568 --> 53:45.003
Oh, no.

53:45.071 --> 53:47.005
Me? No.

53:47.073 --> 53:48.439
I'm a patient.

53:50.076 --> 53:53.011
Marlon joseph borunki,
paranoid schizophrenic.

53:53.079 --> 53:55.013
Deep feelings
of inferiority

53:55.081 --> 53:57.515
Alternating with
delusions of grandeur.

53:57.583 --> 53:58.683
Hi.

53:58.751 --> 54:03.121
Sonny lawson.
Real estate.

54:03.188 --> 54:05.991
Didn't you used
to be on television

54:06.058 --> 54:09.027
Selling land
somewhere?

54:09.095 --> 54:10.795
I used to watch you.
Lake crest estates, right?

54:10.863 --> 54:14.132
You didn't buy a lot?
I swear there was a lake!

54:14.199 --> 54:17.135
I don't buy land
from television.

54:17.202 --> 54:20.138
I'm crazy, but
I'm not that crazy.

54:20.205 --> 54:22.140
A real tv star!

54:22.207 --> 54:23.875
How'd I get here?

54:23.943 --> 54:26.377
I can't get over it!

54:26.445 --> 54:28.713
Sonny lawson...What?

54:28.781 --> 54:30.715
How'd I get here?

54:30.783 --> 54:34.385
They transferred you
from the hospital.

54:34.453 --> 54:36.888
You tried
to kill yourself.

54:36.956 --> 54:39.057
Unsuccessfully,
needless to add.

54:39.125 --> 54:40.558
Aw, shit!

54:40.626 --> 54:43.261
Why did you
say it, dummy?

54:47.900 --> 54:50.835
I'm writing a book
on insanity.

54:50.903 --> 54:54.172
You should write
about something you know.

54:54.239 --> 54:55.840
I'm calling it,

54:55.908 --> 54:57.842
<i>Fruitcakes I have known.</i>

54:57.910 --> 55:01.345
There's 2 whole
chapters on suicide.

55:01.413 --> 55:04.899
Did you know
that 50% of all...

55:04.934 --> 55:07.368
F-f-female suicides
have bleached hair

55:07.436 --> 55:09.304
And a hysterectomy scar?

55:10.940 --> 55:12.756
Are you blue?
Depressed?

55:12.825 --> 55:14.358
Yeah.

55:14.426 --> 55:15.960
Oh.

55:16.028 --> 55:18.262
I thought
I'd wake up dead!

55:18.330 --> 55:20.364
They had no right
to stop me like that!

55:20.432 --> 55:21.866
Technically,
they did.

55:21.934 --> 55:24.869
It's against the law
to kill yourself.

55:24.937 --> 55:26.370
You're kidding?

55:26.438 --> 55:27.872
Are you kidding?

55:27.940 --> 55:29.373
Suicide's
a serious thing.

55:29.441 --> 55:31.375
I've never lied
to you, have I?

55:31.443 --> 55:32.376
No.

55:32.444 --> 55:33.610
See?

55:33.678 --> 55:36.881
Suicide is legislated
against in most states.

55:36.949 --> 55:40.885
It's all in
the appendix of my book.

55:40.953 --> 55:42.386
Dumb law.

55:42.454 --> 55:44.388
I agree with you.
It's very presumptuous

55:44.456 --> 55:46.257
To tell a person
how they can die

55:46.325 --> 55:47.825
Or even how
they can live.

55:47.893 --> 55:49.327
A dumb law!

55:49.394 --> 55:51.262
It's a dumb law!

55:52.898 --> 55:55.333
Sane people
make crazy rules.

55:55.400 --> 55:57.634
Do you like me?

55:59.238 --> 56:00.338
Sure.

56:00.405 --> 56:03.007
I don't know you
very well.

56:03.075 --> 56:05.843
Are you kidding?
I'm very superficial.

56:05.911 --> 56:07.345
You said it.

56:07.412 --> 56:09.780
I know!
Leave me alone!

56:17.422 --> 56:19.857
Are you rooming
here with me?

56:19.925 --> 56:20.925
Me?

56:20.993 --> 56:21.859
No.

56:23.495 --> 56:24.362
No.

56:29.001 --> 56:31.936
Actually, I'm in
the south wing.

56:32.004 --> 56:33.938
Ta-da!

56:34.006 --> 56:35.773
The south wing.

56:35.840 --> 56:37.775
With the
dangerous ones.

56:37.842 --> 56:38.876
You're dangerous?

56:38.944 --> 56:39.944
No.

56:40.012 --> 56:41.279
Yes!

56:41.346 --> 56:42.446
No.

56:42.514 --> 56:43.881
Don't listen to him.

56:43.949 --> 56:46.083
Actually, my father thought
I was very dangerous.

56:49.054 --> 56:50.388
Your father?

56:50.455 --> 56:52.390
Did he
put you here?

56:52.457 --> 56:53.891
No. Kind of.

56:53.959 --> 56:55.326
I strangled him.

56:58.463 --> 57:00.398
You mean...

57:00.465 --> 57:01.899
Like that?

57:01.967 --> 57:04.402
No. More like that.

57:04.469 --> 57:07.838
He was right about
me being dangerous.

57:10.993 --> 57:13.460
Doctors have different theories
about why I did it.

57:13.528 --> 57:15.196
Mother complex,
father complex.

57:15.263 --> 57:18.265
Feelings of inferiority,
suppressed rage.

57:18.333 --> 57:21.869
But I and I alone know
the reason that I did it.

57:24.506 --> 57:26.373
It was because...

57:28.010 --> 57:30.377
He was so polish.

57:34.282 --> 57:35.516
Polish?

57:37.853 --> 57:42.056
When I was a kid, I was
tormented with polish jokes.

57:42.124 --> 57:43.490
Oh, you know.

57:43.558 --> 57:45.426
Who was poland's
man of the year?

57:45.493 --> 57:48.162
Nobody.

57:48.230 --> 57:52.333
How do you sing the polish
national anthem?

57:52.400 --> 57:56.804
You don't sing it,
you fart it.

57:58.373 --> 58:01.442
How do you tell a polack's
identification?

58:01.509 --> 58:05.046
By the shit in his wallet.

58:13.155 --> 58:15.356
Kids can be very cruel.

58:15.423 --> 58:18.259
What kids?
My father told me those.

58:18.326 --> 58:20.995
He was always teasing me.

58:21.063 --> 58:26.533
He was a big, loud,
hairy, sweaty polack!

58:28.370 --> 58:31.105
He was covered
with sweat. Always.

58:31.173 --> 58:34.142
Only man I know who could
sweat while he was swimming.

58:34.209 --> 58:37.078
And I could never
have friends over

58:37.146 --> 58:39.747
Because he
challenged them

58:39.815 --> 58:41.649
To a nose-picking
contest...

58:41.716 --> 58:43.517
And he always won!

58:47.156 --> 58:49.590
Got a minute?

58:49.658 --> 58:51.592
Sure.

58:51.660 --> 58:54.428
Then I finally
brought home my...

58:54.496 --> 58:56.530
G...G...

58:58.400 --> 58:59.517
Girl.

59:00.652 --> 59:03.587
...Before I took
her out to dinner.

59:03.655 --> 59:06.590
I knew I shouldn't
have done it.

59:06.658 --> 59:10.594
He was sitting in his
favorite sweaty undershirt,

59:10.662 --> 59:12.096
Drinking beer,

59:12.164 --> 59:14.598
Eating chili
with his fingers,

59:14.666 --> 59:16.600
<i>And watching
celebrity bowling.</i>

59:16.668 --> 59:20.604
At first, he was nice,
we were talking nice,

59:20.672 --> 59:23.107
And then
he was so stupid!

59:23.175 --> 59:26.410
<i>He said how he
thought moby dick</i>

59:26.478 --> 59:28.812
Was a venereal disease.

59:28.880 --> 59:30.814
I told him in a nice way

59:30.882 --> 59:33.384
What a stupid idiot he was.

59:33.452 --> 59:36.753
Then he told her
that he thought

59:36.821 --> 59:38.456
She was
wasting her time

59:38.523 --> 59:42.560
With a loser like me.

59:42.627 --> 59:47.030
So I put my hands
around his 22-inch neck

59:47.099 --> 59:49.066
And I strangled him!

59:53.972 --> 59:56.407
We never went to dinner

59:56.475 --> 59:58.409
Because I strangled him.

59:58.477 --> 01:00:00.978
You say it
like you're proud!

01:00:01.045 --> 01:00:04.615
Well, you didn't have
the courage to do it.

01:00:04.682 --> 01:00:06.250
Stop it!

01:00:06.318 --> 01:00:07.884
No!

01:00:09.988 --> 01:00:13.857
I feel sick.
I feel sick.

01:00:13.925 --> 01:00:16.860
When I was a little kid,
my mother left us.

01:00:16.928 --> 01:00:19.363
Just left us.
I was a baby.

01:00:19.431 --> 01:00:21.365
She said, "bye! Bye!"

01:00:21.433 --> 01:00:24.801
I have always
respected her for that.

01:00:29.441 --> 01:00:33.810
Think this county will ever
switch to the metric system?

01:00:38.183 --> 01:00:40.251
I got to pee.

01:00:40.318 --> 01:00:44.321
100% of all new arrivals
have to pee.

01:00:44.389 --> 01:00:46.823
Don't get up.
Ta-da!

01:00:46.891 --> 01:00:48.825
I can't use that.

01:00:48.893 --> 01:00:50.827
Want a bigger one?

01:00:50.895 --> 01:00:51.828
No.

01:00:51.896 --> 01:00:53.830
I'll get the nurse.

01:00:53.898 --> 01:00:56.500
No! I can't pee
with a nurse around.

01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:03.274
9!

01:01:09.147 --> 01:01:11.415
I can't pee
with the door open.

01:01:16.271 --> 01:01:20.090
You know, you got a lot
of rules about peeing.

01:01:20.158 --> 01:01:21.525
Yeah, I know.

01:01:41.396 --> 01:01:42.596
Finished?

01:01:42.664 --> 01:01:43.531
Yeah.

01:01:43.598 --> 01:01:44.932
Mr. Lawson!

01:01:44.999 --> 01:01:46.434
That's all right,

01:01:46.501 --> 01:01:49.403
Having so many rules
about peeing.

01:01:49.471 --> 01:01:50.404
Thank you.

01:01:50.472 --> 01:01:52.573
You're welcome.
He pees a lot.

01:01:52.641 --> 01:01:55.075
Damn it, there's
nothing in there!

01:01:55.143 --> 01:01:57.077
Nothing in there to
stick or shove or cut!

01:01:57.145 --> 01:01:58.679
No way you could kill
yourself in there!

01:01:58.747 --> 01:02:00.047
They're
very thorough.

01:02:00.114 --> 01:02:01.415
That's so stupid!

01:02:01.483 --> 01:02:02.883
There's no razors.

01:02:02.951 --> 01:02:05.085
New shatterproof glass.
There's no mirrors.

01:02:05.153 --> 01:02:06.420
No mirror?

01:02:06.488 --> 01:02:08.088
There's no mirror
in here!

01:02:08.156 --> 01:02:11.291
There's no place you
could look at yourself!

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:16.597
You can't look
at yourself!

01:02:16.664 --> 01:02:17.664
I'm so sorry.

01:02:17.732 --> 01:02:20.234
I wish you
could hurt yourself.

01:02:22.737 --> 01:02:25.439
What are you doing?

01:02:25.507 --> 01:02:26.707
You're, uh...

01:02:28.443 --> 01:02:30.711
You're a fighter.

01:02:30.778 --> 01:02:33.447
You're cold?

01:02:35.250 --> 01:02:36.817
You're hitting me.

01:02:36.885 --> 01:02:38.919
You're trying
to suffocate!

01:02:38.987 --> 01:02:41.022
No, don't do that!
Know what happens?

01:02:41.089 --> 01:02:44.625
You pass out, breathe,
and get a headache.

01:02:44.692 --> 01:02:46.460
It doesn't work.

01:02:49.797 --> 01:02:50.731
See?

01:02:50.798 --> 01:02:52.066
No, it doesn't work.

01:02:52.134 --> 01:02:53.901
Shoot!

01:02:53.968 --> 01:02:55.302
You got
a headache, right?

01:02:55.370 --> 01:02:56.737
I got a headache.

01:02:56.804 --> 01:02:59.106
Told you.
Look, an electric bed.

01:02:59.174 --> 01:03:01.008
Stick your head in there

01:03:01.076 --> 01:03:03.511
And crack it
like a walnut. See?

01:03:03.578 --> 01:03:04.545
Oh!

01:03:06.081 --> 01:03:08.349
You're not so crazy.

01:03:10.085 --> 01:03:12.219
Tut, tut, tut,
marlon.

01:03:13.721 --> 01:03:16.023
Tut, tut, tut,
marlon.

01:03:16.091 --> 01:03:19.326
You've been making your
own visiting hours again.

01:03:19.394 --> 01:03:21.828
Get away from me
with that thing!

01:03:21.896 --> 01:03:23.431
Come with me,
mr. Lawson.

01:03:23.498 --> 01:03:26.934
Just think of it as
a polish dinner jacket.

01:03:27.001 --> 01:03:29.503
No...No, no!

01:03:29.571 --> 01:03:32.873
Don't say polish to him.
He's very sensitive. Aah!

01:03:32.941 --> 01:03:34.875
I got you!

01:03:34.943 --> 01:03:36.377
Don't hurt me.

01:03:36.445 --> 01:03:38.028
Get away,
you little dwarf!

01:03:38.096 --> 01:03:39.263
I usually escape

01:03:39.331 --> 01:03:41.599
Every Wednesday
and Friday, mr. Lawson.

01:03:41.667 --> 01:03:42.600
Sonny.

01:03:42.668 --> 01:03:44.802
Sonny!
He's my friend!

01:03:44.869 --> 01:03:46.804
Just a minute.

01:03:46.871 --> 01:03:48.872
He's my friend.
Wait a minute!

01:03:48.940 --> 01:03:50.308
He's my friend!

01:03:50.375 --> 01:03:51.809
Wait! Wait!

01:03:51.876 --> 01:03:53.244
Home, james.

01:03:54.413 --> 01:03:56.597
Oh, doctor, sonny
will try again.

01:03:56.664 --> 01:03:58.599
He likes to
get his way.

01:03:58.666 --> 01:04:00.601
Set your mind at
ease, mrs. Lawson,

01:04:00.668 --> 01:04:01.835
These rooms
were designed

01:04:01.903 --> 01:04:04.338
To house
attempted suicides.

01:04:04.406 --> 01:04:05.839
The windows
are barred.

01:04:05.907 --> 01:04:08.342
There are no cords or
sharp objects in the room.

01:04:08.410 --> 01:04:09.843
There's constant
surveillance.

01:04:09.911 --> 01:04:12.346
There's no way he could
hurt himself in here.

01:04:12.414 --> 01:04:13.698
I see.
Oh!

01:04:15.066 --> 01:04:16.066
Oh, shit!

01:04:16.134 --> 01:04:17.067
Oh, my god!

01:04:17.135 --> 01:04:19.002
Aaahhh!

01:04:22.841 --> 01:04:25.676
Gentlemen, out with
the old dangerous beds,

01:04:25.744 --> 01:04:28.178
In with the new safe beds!

01:04:28.247 --> 01:04:30.914
Out with the old
dangerous beds!

01:04:30.982 --> 01:04:35.119
Sonny, listen. I know you're
suffering from depression

01:04:35.186 --> 01:04:36.387
As much as your illness.

01:04:36.455 --> 01:04:38.088
Now, when your
depression goes away-

01:04:38.156 --> 01:04:39.790
Of course I'm depressed.

01:04:39.858 --> 01:04:42.593
I'm gonna shrivel up
and turn yellow.

01:04:42.661 --> 01:04:44.928
Think the idea of
looking like an old jap

01:04:44.996 --> 01:04:46.297
Makes me cheerful?

01:04:46.365 --> 01:04:48.499
Just calm down, ok?
It's all right.

01:04:48.567 --> 01:04:49.700
I don't want
to calm down.

01:04:49.768 --> 01:04:51.702
I don't want
to calm down!

01:04:51.770 --> 01:04:54.572
God knows I've only got a
couple more days to live.

01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:56.073
That's bullshit,
too, sonny.

01:04:56.141 --> 01:04:58.909
Your doctor said you're
not going to die right away.

01:04:58.977 --> 01:05:01.111
Sonny, why do you have
to rush everything?

01:05:01.179 --> 01:05:02.780
I don't want to rush
everything.

01:05:02.847 --> 01:05:04.615
The courts may decide
very soon

01:05:04.683 --> 01:05:06.584
That I'm not rational
enough to make decisions,

01:05:06.652 --> 01:05:08.152
And they'll assign
some turkey like you

01:05:08.219 --> 01:05:09.520
To make them for me.

01:05:09.588 --> 01:05:11.322
I don't deserve that,
sonny.

01:05:11.390 --> 01:05:12.490
I'm sorry.

01:05:12.557 --> 01:05:13.658
That's ok.

01:05:13.725 --> 01:05:14.692
Sorry.

01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:16.160
Ah, it's ok.

01:05:16.227 --> 01:05:18.529
I don't deserve
to die, either.

01:05:18.597 --> 01:05:19.630
No.

01:05:19.698 --> 01:05:21.599
I need to talk
to you alone, jessie.

01:05:21.667 --> 01:05:22.933
Sonny, I don't
think so.

01:05:23.001 --> 01:05:25.770
Please, jessie,
please. Please.

01:05:25.837 --> 01:05:27.871
Uh, that's ok,
that's ok.

01:05:27.939 --> 01:05:30.174
Look, sonny,
I'll, uh...

01:05:30.241 --> 01:05:33.177
I'll...I'll
wait down here.

01:05:33.244 --> 01:05:35.179
Listen,
I'm your friend.

01:05:35.246 --> 01:05:36.580
I love you.

01:05:36.648 --> 01:05:37.948
I'll do anything
for you.

01:05:38.016 --> 01:05:39.016
I'll be your slave,

01:05:39.083 --> 01:05:40.351
I'll get you girls.

01:05:40.419 --> 01:05:42.353
Oh, I'm sorry,
jessie. It's just-

01:05:42.421 --> 01:05:43.354
It's ok.

01:05:43.422 --> 01:05:45.389
I just can't sign
that release.

01:05:45.457 --> 01:05:47.157
It's ok, marty.

01:05:47.225 --> 01:05:49.660
Just, uh...

01:05:49.728 --> 01:05:51.895
Just wait down at
the end of the hall.

01:05:51.963 --> 01:05:53.364
And I love you, marty.

01:05:53.432 --> 01:05:55.065
Down here?

01:05:57.035 --> 01:05:58.669
Please.
Hmm?

01:05:58.737 --> 01:06:01.204
Will you go in the room
with me, jess?

01:06:01.272 --> 01:06:02.573
All right.

01:06:03.808 --> 01:06:06.309
Oh, hi.
How's it going?

01:06:06.377 --> 01:06:08.512
Good to see you, too.

01:06:09.781 --> 01:06:11.815
Hi, hi.
How's it going?

01:06:11.883 --> 01:06:14.751
Get me out of here!
I'm going wacko!

01:06:14.819 --> 01:06:16.787
Honey, I understand
what you're going-

01:06:16.855 --> 01:06:19.690
You won't understand until
you've been pronounced dead!

01:06:19.757 --> 01:06:21.558
I'm trying
to understand.

01:06:21.626 --> 01:06:23.326
You're doing
a lousy job.

01:06:23.394 --> 01:06:25.996
Sonny, I don't want to
see you kill yourself.

01:06:26.063 --> 01:06:27.598
It would be a burden

01:06:27.665 --> 01:06:31.334
I would carry for
the rest of my life.

01:06:31.402 --> 01:06:33.770
Don't you understand? If
I let you take your life,

01:06:33.838 --> 01:06:36.439
It would make
my life meaningless.

01:06:36.508 --> 01:06:39.342
Tell me
you understand that.

01:06:39.410 --> 01:06:40.343
Jessie.

01:06:40.411 --> 01:06:41.344
What?

01:06:41.412 --> 01:06:44.014
You're a selfish bitch.

01:06:44.081 --> 01:06:45.281
Jessie, I'm sorry.

01:06:45.349 --> 01:06:47.050
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:06:47.118 --> 01:06:49.820
You're just a wife,
not a selfish bitch.

01:06:49.888 --> 01:06:52.288
You are a sexist ass,
right to the last!

01:06:52.356 --> 01:06:53.824
I know, I'm sorry.

01:06:53.892 --> 01:06:57.227
I'm just trying
to be nice.

01:06:57.294 --> 01:06:59.696
Just trying to be nice,
that's all.

01:06:59.764 --> 01:07:02.032
Sonny, sonny.
Ha ha.

01:07:02.099 --> 01:07:03.634
Forget it.

01:07:03.701 --> 01:07:06.770
We've forgotten how
to be nice to each other.

01:07:06.838 --> 01:07:09.640
But we should try
harder, jessie.

01:07:09.707 --> 01:07:11.474
We should try to be
nice to each other.

01:07:11.543 --> 01:07:14.177
Let's try to be nice
to each other, ok?

01:07:14.245 --> 01:07:15.445
Sign me out of here.

01:07:15.513 --> 01:07:18.114
Oh, sonny. Come on!

01:07:18.182 --> 01:07:20.150
I've had
enough of this.

01:07:20.217 --> 01:07:23.420
Ok, maybe I can't
imagine how you feel,

01:07:23.487 --> 01:07:25.622
But can you imagine
how I feel?

01:07:25.690 --> 01:07:26.957
No.

01:07:27.025 --> 01:07:29.693
Sonny, suppose I wanted
to kill myself.

01:07:29.761 --> 01:07:31.628
Would you let me?

01:07:31.696 --> 01:07:33.997
You mean if you
were going to die?

01:07:34.065 --> 01:07:35.198
Yeah!

01:07:37.268 --> 01:07:39.970
Of course I would.

01:07:40.038 --> 01:07:42.172
You really would?

01:07:44.275 --> 01:07:47.110
Well, if you were
in a lot of pain.

01:07:47.178 --> 01:07:49.613
Aw, sonny.

01:07:53.284 --> 01:07:54.484
No.

01:07:56.287 --> 01:07:57.854
No, I wouldn't!

01:07:57.922 --> 01:08:00.490
I wouldn't, jessie,
I wouldn't.

01:08:00.558 --> 01:08:05.328
Oh, sonny.

01:08:05.396 --> 01:08:06.730
Oh, jessie.

01:08:13.171 --> 01:08:15.088
People tend
to coddle or cover up things

01:08:15.156 --> 01:08:16.657
When someone they love
is ill.

01:08:16.725 --> 01:08:17.991
Makes them feel better.

01:08:18.059 --> 01:08:20.093
Screw 'em.
Screw 'em.

01:08:20.161 --> 01:08:21.929
One of the worst
aspects of dying

01:08:21.996 --> 01:08:23.296
Is that you're so alone.

01:08:23.363 --> 01:08:24.564
Oh, god,
you're so alone.

01:08:24.631 --> 01:08:25.631
So alone.

01:08:25.700 --> 01:08:28.135
People are
unable or afraid

01:08:28.203 --> 01:08:30.136
To share your grief.

01:08:30.205 --> 01:08:33.140
They'll never be able to
imagine how alone you are.

01:08:33.207 --> 01:08:36.042
I don't have
to imagine it.

01:08:36.111 --> 01:08:38.045
I'm dying, too.

01:08:39.698 --> 01:08:41.131
You're dying, too?

01:08:41.198 --> 01:08:43.667
Yep. The doctors tell me
I can go any time.

01:08:43.734 --> 01:08:45.167
Just like that.

01:08:45.236 --> 01:08:49.473
Of course, they told me
that about 2 years ago.

01:08:49.541 --> 01:08:51.575
You seem so alive.

01:08:51.643 --> 01:08:52.943
Strange, isn't it?

01:08:53.011 --> 01:08:54.712
I'm not always this robust.

01:08:54.779 --> 01:08:57.781
Right now, I seem to be in
a period of total remission.

01:08:57.849 --> 01:09:00.082
Even played tennis today.

01:09:00.151 --> 01:09:01.585
Did you win?

01:09:01.653 --> 01:09:03.821
No, I played shitty.

01:09:03.889 --> 01:09:07.024
But then I also played
shitty when I was well.

01:09:09.027 --> 01:09:11.094
What the-what's
wrong with you?

01:09:11.162 --> 01:09:12.595
Heart trouble.

01:09:12.663 --> 01:09:15.533
Lots and lots
of heart trouble.

01:09:17.167 --> 01:09:20.603
I'm not taking your,
uh, therapy group.

01:09:20.671 --> 01:09:22.205
Some people
in my therapy group

01:09:22.273 --> 01:09:24.073
Are really close to
kicking the bucket.

01:09:24.142 --> 01:09:25.441
You're gonna love 'em.

01:09:25.509 --> 01:09:27.443
I'm committing
suicide, remember?

01:09:27.511 --> 01:09:30.446
You're sure having
a hard time doing it.

01:09:30.514 --> 01:09:32.115
That's because nobody
will leave me alone.

01:09:32.183 --> 01:09:34.117
Either that or you
really don't want to.

01:09:34.185 --> 01:09:35.417
I want to do it.

01:09:35.486 --> 01:09:37.287
I want to
commit suicide.

01:09:37.354 --> 01:09:38.921
I'm in love
with the idea

01:09:38.990 --> 01:09:40.256
Of killing myself.

01:09:40.323 --> 01:09:42.492
When I think about it,
I get a hard-on.

01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:45.328
I'm sure there's
a part of you

01:09:45.395 --> 01:09:47.397
That thinks of it
as a romantic notion.

01:09:47.464 --> 01:09:49.700
But there's another part
of you that feels guilty

01:09:49.767 --> 01:09:51.801
For taking your own life.

01:09:51.868 --> 01:09:53.770
That's psychological
bullshit.

01:09:53.837 --> 01:09:56.006
I don't feel guilty
about anything.

01:09:56.074 --> 01:09:59.076
Then why did your suicide
letter to your daughter

01:09:59.143 --> 01:10:01.111
Begin with an apology?

01:10:01.179 --> 01:10:03.446
"dear julie,
daddy is so sorry

01:10:03.514 --> 01:10:05.048
For what he's about to do-"

01:10:05.116 --> 01:10:07.784
Give me that,
you son of a bitch!

01:10:07.852 --> 01:10:10.954
How could you?
Damn it!

01:10:11.022 --> 01:10:13.790
Aw, shit!

01:10:13.858 --> 01:10:15.092
Feel better?

01:10:15.159 --> 01:10:16.026
No!

01:10:17.328 --> 01:10:19.262
You don't play fair!

01:10:19.731 --> 01:10:21.281
The stakes are high-
life and death.

01:10:21.349 --> 01:10:22.482
Want to
punch the scale?

01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:23.483
Yeah!

01:10:23.551 --> 01:10:24.684
No!

01:10:24.752 --> 01:10:25.719
Yeah!

01:10:27.121 --> 01:10:28.222
Shit!

01:10:29.557 --> 01:10:31.791
I mean they...
They shoot horses

01:10:31.860 --> 01:10:34.094
When they're miserable,
don't they?

01:10:37.866 --> 01:10:38.798
Ow!

01:10:38.867 --> 01:10:40.800
You see, I'm
terrified of pain.

01:10:40.869 --> 01:10:42.302
Pain hurts me.

01:10:42.370 --> 01:10:44.271
Sonny, what makes you
so convinced

01:10:44.339 --> 01:10:45.805
Your death is
going to be painful?

01:10:45.874 --> 01:10:48.675
Have you ever actually
seen someone die?

01:10:48.743 --> 01:10:50.110
Haircuts hurt me.

01:10:50.178 --> 01:10:52.246
People should
die at home.

01:10:52.313 --> 01:10:55.082
Well, that would be kind
of difficult with me.

01:10:55.149 --> 01:10:57.985
I mean, hustling
from my house

01:10:58.052 --> 01:10:59.353
To my
ex-wife's house

01:10:59.420 --> 01:11:00.820
To my
girlfriend's house.

01:11:00.889 --> 01:11:06.193
Hell, I'd be dying
in a taxicab.

01:11:06.261 --> 01:11:08.195
Are your parents
alive, sonny?

01:11:08.263 --> 01:11:09.129
No.

01:11:11.266 --> 01:11:12.699
Yeah!

01:11:12.767 --> 01:11:14.701
They're alive.

01:11:14.769 --> 01:11:16.703
I guess that's called
a freudian slip.

01:11:16.771 --> 01:11:18.671
Either that...
Or a boo-boo.

01:11:18.739 --> 01:11:19.806
Ha ha ha.

01:11:19.874 --> 01:11:23.476
Why don't you come to one
death therapy session?

01:11:23.544 --> 01:11:25.212
Just talking to people
like yourself

01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:27.714
Can make
death less scary.

01:11:27.782 --> 01:11:29.149
Maybe even meaningful.

01:11:30.785 --> 01:11:32.352
I don't think so, doc.

01:11:32.420 --> 01:11:34.687
Ok. I'll let you
out of here.

01:11:34.755 --> 01:11:38.191
But I want you to at least
read a pamphlet, ok?

01:11:38.259 --> 01:11:39.726
Ok.

01:11:39.794 --> 01:11:43.163
you are
my sunshine...

01:11:47.936 --> 01:11:49.736
Oh, oh!

01:11:49.804 --> 01:11:51.671
Boy, I tell
you something.

01:11:51.739 --> 01:11:53.140
You're the happiest
son of a bitch

01:11:53.207 --> 01:11:54.308
I've ever seen.

01:11:54.375 --> 01:11:56.609
You're jumping up and down
and whistling like that.

01:11:56.677 --> 01:11:58.178
I'm gonna die,
you're gonna die,

01:11:58.246 --> 01:12:00.013
And you're jumping up
and down whistling.

01:12:00.081 --> 01:12:01.281
I'm with you!

01:12:01.349 --> 01:12:02.282
Really?

01:12:02.350 --> 01:12:04.284
It's a good decision.

01:12:04.352 --> 01:12:06.286
You're a great salesman-
don't back out on me.

01:12:06.354 --> 01:12:08.221
I'm not
going anywhere.

01:12:20.768 --> 01:12:23.703
What did you
do to him?

01:12:23.771 --> 01:12:25.905
I liked him.

01:12:42.490 --> 01:12:43.624
Sonny!

01:12:46.527 --> 01:12:47.628
Hiya, sonny!

01:12:47.695 --> 01:12:48.962
Hi, marlon.

01:12:49.030 --> 01:12:50.797
How did
you escape?

01:12:50.865 --> 01:12:52.966
Oh, yeah.
I escaped!

01:12:53.034 --> 01:12:54.901
How'd you do it?

01:12:57.705 --> 01:12:59.139
I forgot.

01:12:59.206 --> 01:13:02.308
I forget things
when I do them.

01:13:02.376 --> 01:13:03.376
You're lucky.

01:13:03.444 --> 01:13:04.444
About what?

01:13:04.512 --> 01:13:05.445
Forgetting.

01:13:05.513 --> 01:13:06.947
I know.

01:13:07.015 --> 01:13:09.382
There's a lot of crazy
people around here.

01:13:11.519 --> 01:13:14.087
Did you hear
about the bed?

01:13:14.155 --> 01:13:16.289
I heard
what happened.

01:13:16.357 --> 01:13:18.458
It hurt my head.

01:13:18.526 --> 01:13:20.460
You shouldn't
listen to me.

01:13:20.528 --> 01:13:23.897
Out of the mouths of polacks
oft times comes ca-ca.

01:13:23.965 --> 01:13:25.732
Don't put yourself down
for being polish.

01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:27.467
One of my favorite
people is polish.

01:13:27.535 --> 01:13:28.869
Yeah, who?
You.

01:13:28.936 --> 01:13:31.872
Ohh. Ha ha ha ha.

01:13:31.939 --> 01:13:33.473
But it did hurt.

01:13:33.541 --> 01:13:34.607
Good.

01:13:34.676 --> 01:13:36.476
Not good.
I don't like pain.

01:13:36.544 --> 01:13:39.713
I want to die
without hurting myself.

01:13:39.781 --> 01:13:43.449
You got a lot
of rules about dying, too.

01:13:43.517 --> 01:13:45.819
I always thought
jumping out a window

01:13:45.887 --> 01:13:47.220
Would be
completely painless...

01:13:47.288 --> 01:13:48.321
Until you landed.

01:13:48.389 --> 01:13:50.090
Then it would be
very painful.

01:13:50.158 --> 01:13:52.592
You couldn't change
your mind once you started.

01:13:52.660 --> 01:13:54.194
No.
Geronimo!

01:13:55.897 --> 01:13:58.598
All the windows here
got bars on them.

01:13:58.666 --> 01:14:00.000
Except the tower.

01:14:00.068 --> 01:14:01.868
Tower?

01:14:01.936 --> 01:14:03.603
Where's the tower?

01:14:11.179 --> 01:14:13.046
Here it is!
The tower.

01:14:13.114 --> 01:14:14.614
I love high places.

01:14:14.682 --> 01:14:16.983
I'm not
crazy about them.

01:14:17.051 --> 01:14:18.685
It's got
a ledge, huh?

01:14:18.753 --> 01:14:20.353
Just like in
the movies.

01:14:20.421 --> 01:14:22.622
It'll give you
some place to stand on,

01:14:22.690 --> 01:14:24.624
And I can cheer you on.

01:14:24.692 --> 01:14:26.626
Ok, sonny...Jump!

01:14:26.694 --> 01:14:28.128
Don't be so anxious!

01:14:28.196 --> 01:14:31.297
I'm sorry. I thought
that's what you wanted.

01:14:31.365 --> 01:14:32.632
I am, but...

01:14:32.700 --> 01:14:34.634
It doesn't seem
high enough.

01:14:34.702 --> 01:14:36.136
Sure it's high enough.

01:14:36.204 --> 01:14:37.137
You sure?

01:14:37.205 --> 01:14:39.305
Only one way
to find out.

01:14:39.373 --> 01:14:41.374
Will you stop?
I'm gonna do it.

01:14:41.442 --> 01:14:44.244
I've got to work
up to it gradually.

01:14:44.311 --> 01:14:47.063
You'll never get hurt
if you crawl down.

01:14:47.131 --> 01:14:50.066
I'm the one
that's doing it.

01:14:50.134 --> 01:14:51.601
Ok.
You're very brave.

01:14:51.668 --> 01:14:52.702
I am brave.

01:14:52.769 --> 01:14:53.970
I gotcha.

01:14:54.038 --> 01:14:56.406
Let me look
before I go.

01:14:58.009 --> 01:14:59.692
It ain't high enough!

01:14:59.761 --> 01:15:01.194
Sure, it's high.

01:15:01.262 --> 01:15:02.129
Ahhh!

01:15:03.264 --> 01:15:06.633
Ahhh!

01:15:09.771 --> 01:15:11.704
It ain't
high enough.

01:15:11.773 --> 01:15:14.540
If I land
on my feet,

01:15:14.608 --> 01:15:16.542
I'll have
broken ankles

01:15:16.610 --> 01:15:18.711
And a toxic
blood disease.

01:15:18.780 --> 01:15:20.313
Wait a minute!

01:15:20.381 --> 01:15:21.899
Ahhhhh!

01:15:25.703 --> 01:15:27.654
I got an idea.

01:15:27.721 --> 01:15:30.157
I'll drop you
on your head.

01:15:30.224 --> 01:15:32.159
No, you'll
be a murderer.

01:15:32.226 --> 01:15:33.860
Oh, my god,
a murderer!

01:15:33.928 --> 01:15:36.830
What are you talking about?
I'm already a murderer.

01:15:36.898 --> 01:15:38.498
That's right.
You are a murderer.

01:15:38.565 --> 01:15:40.834
Are you sure you want
that kind of responsibility?

01:15:40.902 --> 01:15:43.303
Did you mean it
when you said you liked me?

01:15:43.370 --> 01:15:44.304
I like you!

01:15:44.371 --> 01:15:46.439
Then I want to help
my friend.

01:15:46.507 --> 01:15:47.941
Pull me in!

01:15:48.009 --> 01:15:50.277
Then can I drop you?
Yes!

01:15:50.344 --> 01:15:51.778
That's good.

01:15:51.846 --> 01:15:54.281
This is
going to be good.

01:15:54.348 --> 01:15:56.616
Now, let me
get your feet.

01:15:56.684 --> 01:15:58.118
Easy does it.
Don't worry.

01:15:58.186 --> 01:15:59.619
Do this slow.

01:15:59.687 --> 01:16:00.787
I understand.

01:16:00.855 --> 01:16:02.289
Let's not rush
into this.

01:16:02.356 --> 01:16:05.792
I'll let you go
whenever you tell me.

01:16:05.860 --> 01:16:08.128
Point your head down.

01:16:08.196 --> 01:16:10.630
Wait, I got
to get ready.

01:16:10.698 --> 01:16:12.132
Ok.

01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:13.133
Ok!

01:16:13.201 --> 01:16:14.301
All right.

01:16:14.368 --> 01:16:16.769
Let me know
when you're down.

01:16:16.838 --> 01:16:18.104
Oh, my god!

01:16:18.172 --> 01:16:19.272
No!

01:16:19.340 --> 01:16:20.941
Shall I let you go?

01:16:21.008 --> 01:16:22.592
No!

01:16:22.659 --> 01:16:24.360
Wait a minute.

01:16:24.428 --> 01:16:26.196
Why?

01:16:26.263 --> 01:16:28.315
Because it ain't
high enough!

01:16:28.382 --> 01:16:30.116
Good for me.

01:16:30.184 --> 01:16:32.385
It isn't
high enough!

01:16:32.453 --> 01:16:33.886
Pull me back.

01:16:33.954 --> 01:16:35.388
Pull me back up!

01:16:35.456 --> 01:16:36.606
I don't think so.

01:16:36.674 --> 01:16:38.491
God damn it,
pull me back!

01:16:38.559 --> 01:16:40.059
Ok! Ok!

01:16:40.228 --> 01:16:42.011
Why did you
pull me back?

01:16:42.079 --> 01:16:43.113
You said-

01:16:43.180 --> 01:16:45.315
I don't have enough
courage or guts.

01:16:45.382 --> 01:16:47.783
That's why you're here.
I can't do it alone.

01:16:47.851 --> 01:16:49.785
If you hadn't
pulled me back,

01:16:49.853 --> 01:16:51.121
I'd be dead now!

01:16:51.188 --> 01:16:52.155
I'm a failure!

01:16:52.223 --> 01:16:53.156
You said it!

01:16:53.224 --> 01:16:54.157
Shut up!

01:16:54.225 --> 01:16:55.825
I got an idea.

01:16:55.892 --> 01:16:56.993
Please tell me.

01:16:57.060 --> 01:16:58.060
I'll sit here.

01:16:58.129 --> 01:17:00.296
You get running
like a bull.

01:17:00.364 --> 01:17:02.298
I'll have
my back to you.

01:17:02.366 --> 01:17:03.833
You push me,
I'll go.

01:17:03.900 --> 01:17:05.835
What a good idea.
Thanks so much.

01:17:05.902 --> 01:17:08.238
It's been a pleasure
knowing you.

01:17:08.305 --> 01:17:10.306
You're my best friend.
Sorry.

01:17:10.374 --> 01:17:11.508
Yeah.

01:17:11.575 --> 01:17:13.743
I'm ready when
you are, sonny.

01:17:13.810 --> 01:17:14.744
Wait.

01:17:14.811 --> 01:17:16.429
Bless me, father...
Come on.

01:17:16.497 --> 01:17:18.131
On second thought.

01:17:18.199 --> 01:17:20.433
Ahhhh!

01:17:26.657 --> 01:17:28.124
You're right, sonny!

01:17:28.192 --> 01:17:30.426
It's not high enough!

01:17:34.731 --> 01:17:37.333
They mate
for life, you know.

01:17:37.401 --> 01:17:39.335
You're kidding.

01:17:39.670 --> 01:17:41.421
I wish I was dead.

01:17:41.488 --> 01:17:44.690
You would be, too,
if it wasn't for my dumb ideas.

01:17:44.758 --> 01:17:46.026
Don't put yourself down.

01:17:46.093 --> 01:17:47.227
You're right!

01:17:47.295 --> 01:17:50.964
Why waste time talking
about a piece of shit like me?

01:17:51.032 --> 01:17:52.865
Ooh, I almost forgot.

01:17:52.934 --> 01:17:54.867
I got you something.

01:17:54.936 --> 01:17:56.369
A present for you.

01:17:56.437 --> 01:17:58.871
That's very nice.
You didn't need to do that.

01:17:58.940 --> 01:18:00.807
Oh, I hope
you like it.

01:18:00.874 --> 01:18:01.808
Very sweet.

01:18:01.875 --> 01:18:03.709
You like the color?

01:18:03.777 --> 01:18:05.211
Yeah.

01:18:05.279 --> 01:18:06.212
Hanging.

01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:07.414
Yeah.

01:18:07.481 --> 01:18:09.549
And the beauty part is
you don't have to do anything.

01:18:09.616 --> 01:18:12.052
You just have to stand there.
I'll do the rest.

01:18:12.119 --> 01:18:14.054
I wonder if it hurts.

01:18:14.121 --> 01:18:16.389
You see,
hanging is very simple.

01:18:16.457 --> 01:18:18.724
It's clean,
neat, and economical.

01:18:18.792 --> 01:18:21.594
You don't spend
any money with a rope.

01:18:21.662 --> 01:18:23.930
It's just the cost
of the rope.

01:18:23.998 --> 01:18:25.398
That's why these things
become traditional.

01:18:25.466 --> 01:18:26.899
I wonder if it hurts.

01:18:26.968 --> 01:18:33.606
marlon. Marlon.
Shouldn't we have a horse?

01:18:33.674 --> 01:18:35.808
Wait a minute.
It's very simple.

01:18:35.876 --> 01:18:36.809
All right. What?

01:18:36.877 --> 01:18:38.845
I just step out
from under you,

01:18:38.912 --> 01:18:40.447
And you'll be hung.

01:18:40.514 --> 01:18:41.448
Don't you understand?

01:18:41.515 --> 01:18:43.016
yes. Uh...

01:18:43.084 --> 01:18:44.050
What?

01:18:44.118 --> 01:18:46.186
do it very slowly.

01:18:46.253 --> 01:18:48.088
Yeah. You want a horse?

01:18:48.155 --> 01:18:49.489
I said...Yes!

01:18:49.556 --> 01:18:52.792
A horse? A horse, a polack,
what's the difference?

01:18:52.860 --> 01:18:54.160
It's the same thing.

01:18:54.228 --> 01:18:56.863
You want a horse?
You got a horse.

01:18:57.999 --> 01:18:59.299
Just a minute.

01:18:59.367 --> 01:19:00.566
You'll be hung
in a moment.

01:19:00.634 --> 01:19:02.602
Ok. Here you go. Ok!

01:19:02.669 --> 01:19:05.938
Say good-bye to marlon!
So long!

01:19:06.007 --> 01:19:08.341
How are you feeling?
Is that ok?

01:19:08.409 --> 01:19:09.342
It hurts.

01:19:09.410 --> 01:19:10.377
What?

01:19:10.444 --> 01:19:11.411
It really hurts.

01:19:11.479 --> 01:19:12.945
You're resisting again.

01:19:13.014 --> 01:19:14.447
You know that?

01:19:14.515 --> 01:19:17.450
You sound just
like donald duck.

01:19:17.518 --> 01:19:19.652
Wait, you're
hurting my neck.

01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:21.638
I...Ooh...Oh!

01:19:21.705 --> 01:19:22.805
Ow!

01:19:22.873 --> 01:19:24.140
Owwww!

01:19:24.207 --> 01:19:26.142
Wait a minute!

01:19:26.209 --> 01:19:29.479
Don't ever
do that to me again!

01:19:29.546 --> 01:19:31.481
I was almost dead!

01:19:31.549 --> 01:19:32.982
One more minute,

01:19:33.050 --> 01:19:35.001
I would've
been dead!

01:19:35.069 --> 01:19:37.154
Let go of me,
you fool!

01:19:37.221 --> 01:19:38.821
Don't ever
stop like that!

01:19:38.889 --> 01:19:40.356
When you got me
like that,

01:19:40.424 --> 01:19:41.524
Don't ever stop.

01:19:41.592 --> 01:19:43.159
Do you understand?

01:19:43.226 --> 01:19:44.594
Yes, I understand.

01:19:47.080 --> 01:19:49.549
I don't think
you understand.

01:19:49.617 --> 01:19:52.519
I don't think you...

01:19:52.586 --> 01:19:54.888
Understand at all.

01:19:56.590 --> 01:20:00.527
I'll have to do
this thing myself.

01:20:00.594 --> 01:20:01.528
Marlon.

01:20:01.595 --> 01:20:04.030
What is it, sonny?

01:20:04.097 --> 01:20:05.164
Good-bye, marlon.

01:20:05.232 --> 01:20:06.198
What?
Good-bye!

01:20:06.266 --> 01:20:07.434
No, wait a minute!

01:20:07.501 --> 01:20:08.468
Wait for me!

01:20:08.536 --> 01:20:11.137
I'm a failure!

01:20:11.205 --> 01:20:13.139
You certainly are.

01:20:13.207 --> 01:20:15.141
But not for long.

01:20:15.209 --> 01:20:16.642
That man's nuts.

01:20:16.710 --> 01:20:17.743
Grab him!

01:20:30.291 --> 01:20:32.725
Aahhh!

01:20:32.793 --> 01:20:34.711
Sonny,
wait for me!

01:20:37.381 --> 01:20:38.381
Come back here!

01:20:38.849 --> 01:20:40.633
I certainly hope my father
likes it here.

01:20:40.701 --> 01:20:42.735
I'm sure he will.

01:20:42.803 --> 01:20:45.605
He seems like
a very nice man.

01:20:45.672 --> 01:20:48.141
Keep your hands
off of me, stubby!

01:20:50.728 --> 01:20:53.229
It sure seems nice here.

01:20:53.296 --> 01:20:54.831
Are there many,
uh, uh, cra-

01:20:54.898 --> 01:20:55.832
No, no, no.

01:20:55.899 --> 01:20:57.867
I would say merely
mildly irrational.

01:20:57.934 --> 01:20:59.869
I got one!
I got one!

01:20:59.936 --> 01:21:02.304
mr. Petersen has one.

01:21:02.373 --> 01:21:03.639
His expression.

01:21:07.411 --> 01:21:09.746
Yeh-hoo-hoo!

01:21:09.813 --> 01:21:11.080
Aah!

01:21:13.884 --> 01:21:15.017
Ohh!

01:21:15.085 --> 01:21:18.104
Aah!

01:21:20.207 --> 01:21:21.758
Whoa!

01:21:26.313 --> 01:21:27.864
Holy shit!

01:21:30.967 --> 01:21:31.934
Hi!

01:21:32.002 --> 01:21:34.003
Oh, no! Go away!

01:21:37.007 --> 01:21:38.441
Get off, off,

01:21:38.509 --> 01:21:40.109
Off, off, off.

01:21:40.176 --> 01:21:42.779
Get off!
I can't see!

01:21:42.846 --> 01:21:43.913
It's a challenge.

01:21:43.980 --> 01:21:45.681
Someone wants
to play chicken.

01:21:48.485 --> 01:21:49.585
Pull over!

01:21:49.653 --> 01:21:52.087
Guts is part
of learning to drive.

01:21:52.155 --> 01:21:53.623
Get out of the way!

01:21:56.092 --> 01:21:57.760
You turkey!

01:21:59.696 --> 01:22:01.263
Ooh, my goodness.

01:22:01.331 --> 01:22:03.032
Aah!

01:22:03.099 --> 01:22:04.099
Ahhh!

01:22:05.269 --> 01:22:06.135
It's a ramp!

01:22:08.389 --> 01:22:12.525
Ahhhh!
Ahhhh!

01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:18.281
That was terrific!

01:22:18.349 --> 01:22:19.549
Do it again!

01:22:19.617 --> 01:22:20.600
Bye, marlon.

01:22:20.668 --> 01:22:21.934
Ooh, sonny!

01:22:22.002 --> 01:22:23.302
Aah! Aah!

01:22:26.139 --> 01:22:27.473
What's happening?

01:22:27.541 --> 01:22:30.076
The polish assassin has just
escaped from that insane asylum.

01:22:30.143 --> 01:22:32.278
He's very dangerous.
He's a killer.

01:22:32.580 --> 01:22:33.262
What'd he look like?

01:22:33.331 --> 01:22:34.964
He's wearing white pants,
white shirt.

01:22:35.032 --> 01:22:36.800
Round face, bald.

01:22:39.970 --> 01:22:41.070
Ohh.

01:22:48.829 --> 01:22:51.431
Free!
The polish prince is free!

01:23:19.677 --> 01:23:20.693
Sweetheart,

01:23:20.761 --> 01:23:22.128
Can I get
you something?

01:23:23.264 --> 01:23:24.697
You got any water?

01:23:24.765 --> 01:23:26.532
Some water, um...

01:23:28.602 --> 01:23:30.470
Oh, a 10.

01:23:33.307 --> 01:23:34.424
Mary ellen,

01:23:34.492 --> 01:23:36.826
If you're going to make
glasses out of jelly jars,

01:23:36.894 --> 01:23:40.196
Can you at least
take the jelly out first?

01:23:40.264 --> 01:23:41.498
Never mind.

01:23:42.666 --> 01:23:44.967
Sonny, you should
be in a hospital,

01:23:45.035 --> 01:23:46.335
Shouldn't you?

01:23:46.404 --> 01:23:49.171
I'm not going to
hospitals anymore.

01:23:49.239 --> 01:23:50.523
I'm not going anywhere

01:23:50.591 --> 01:23:52.258
Where they
have any control

01:23:52.326 --> 01:23:55.361
Over your life...
Or your death.

01:23:59.566 --> 01:24:01.934
What are you
looking for?

01:24:03.069 --> 01:24:04.504
My clothes.

01:24:04.571 --> 01:24:05.938
Where are they?

01:24:07.775 --> 01:24:10.443
Here are your clothes.
I ironed 'em.

01:24:13.480 --> 01:24:15.348
It's not my clothes
I'm looking for,

01:24:15.416 --> 01:24:16.949
And you know it.

01:24:19.152 --> 01:24:20.886
I hid it.

01:24:22.122 --> 01:24:23.756
You're never
gonna find it.

01:24:23.824 --> 01:24:25.090
You're not
even warm.

01:24:25.158 --> 01:24:26.091
Aha!

01:24:26.159 --> 01:24:27.627
Exactly where I thought
it would be.

01:24:27.695 --> 01:24:29.762
Hidden under
the cat crap.

01:24:31.799 --> 01:24:33.132
I'm gonna call
the police.

01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:34.300
Don't touch
that phone.

01:24:34.368 --> 01:24:35.768
I'll shoot...

01:24:35.836 --> 01:24:37.770
Myself.

01:24:37.838 --> 01:24:39.339
That's right, baby.

01:24:39.406 --> 01:24:40.673
Put down that phone

01:24:40.741 --> 01:24:44.344
Or I'll splatter my brains
all over these walls.

01:24:44.411 --> 01:24:46.446
Of course, on these walls,
who would notice?

01:24:46.513 --> 01:24:50.082
Sonny, you
drive me crazy!

01:24:50.150 --> 01:24:52.418
You put a gun
to your head-

01:24:52.486 --> 01:24:54.220
Mary ellen,
will you stop?

01:24:54.287 --> 01:24:55.822
You put that thing
to your head.

01:24:55.889 --> 01:24:57.990
Come on, help me off
with my pants.

01:24:58.058 --> 01:24:59.325
You drive me crazy.

01:24:59.393 --> 01:25:01.361
Help me off with my pants!

01:25:01.428 --> 01:25:02.962
Sonny.
Yes.

01:25:03.029 --> 01:25:04.497
I feel that maybe

01:25:04.565 --> 01:25:07.734
If I'd done
something different.

01:25:07.801 --> 01:25:08.968
I don't know.

01:25:09.035 --> 01:25:12.538
If I'd have loved you
a little bit more...

01:25:14.140 --> 01:25:17.477
Maybe you
wouldn't be dying.

01:25:17.544 --> 01:25:19.311
Maybe it's
all my fault.

01:25:19.380 --> 01:25:21.247
Maybe I caused it.

01:25:21.314 --> 01:25:23.383
Oh, don't be silly,
mary ellen.

01:25:23.450 --> 01:25:25.385
You can't give somebody
a blood disease.

01:25:25.452 --> 01:25:26.819
That's a gift
from god.

01:25:26.887 --> 01:25:29.054
If I could've just...

01:25:29.122 --> 01:25:31.023
Loved you
a little bit more.

01:25:32.459 --> 01:25:33.726
Something.

01:25:33.794 --> 01:25:36.161
No, I don't think you could
have done anything, mary ellen.

01:25:36.229 --> 01:25:38.765
Well, maybe if you'd
just come one time.

01:25:40.467 --> 01:25:42.769
No, actually, you did
everything you could.

01:25:42.836 --> 01:25:43.770
I'm sorry.

01:25:43.837 --> 01:25:46.005
No, you did
everything you could.

01:25:46.072 --> 01:25:47.006
I didn't!

01:25:47.073 --> 01:25:48.240
You did, you did.

01:25:48.308 --> 01:25:49.375
No, I didn't.

01:25:49.443 --> 01:25:51.411
I got more out of
the relationship than you did.

01:25:51.478 --> 01:25:52.678
With all my bitching
and moaning,

01:25:52.746 --> 01:25:54.246
I got more out of
the relationship.

01:25:54.314 --> 01:25:57.717
Because I loved you,
I loved you completely,

01:25:57.785 --> 01:26:00.219
And you never did really
love me completely,

01:26:00.287 --> 01:26:02.822
And-and I was always
fascinated by that.

01:26:02.890 --> 01:26:04.557
You know what I mean?

01:26:04.625 --> 01:26:05.825
No.

01:26:05.893 --> 01:26:07.259
Well, it's like me.

01:26:07.327 --> 01:26:08.461
I mean, if you think about it,

01:26:08.529 --> 01:26:10.897
I think that's why
I just kept, you know,

01:26:10.964 --> 01:26:12.932
Hanging on and hanging on.

01:26:12.999 --> 01:26:14.834
Doesn't that
sound like me?

01:26:14.902 --> 01:26:16.969
Yeah, it does
sound like you.

01:26:17.037 --> 01:26:19.171
I'll tell you something else,
mary ellen...

01:26:19.239 --> 01:26:22.708
With all this shit...

01:26:22.776 --> 01:26:23.943
All this shit...

01:26:25.145 --> 01:26:26.913
You always
turned me on.

01:26:26.980 --> 01:26:28.747
Always.

01:26:28.816 --> 01:26:29.916
That's something,
isn't it?

01:26:29.983 --> 01:26:31.918
Yeah.

01:26:31.985 --> 01:26:36.088
Well, doesn't
that make you kind of...

01:26:36.156 --> 01:26:39.125
Understand
a little bit better

01:26:39.193 --> 01:26:41.994
What I want to do?
I mean...

01:26:42.062 --> 01:26:43.162
Suicide.

01:26:43.230 --> 01:26:46.532
I think I'm starting
to understand.

01:26:46.599 --> 01:26:48.767
I do.

01:26:48.836 --> 01:26:51.103
Maybe it means
I'm growing up.

01:26:51.171 --> 01:26:53.172
I guess I've
just been selfish,

01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:54.506
Wanting to
keep you around

01:26:54.574 --> 01:26:57.409
A little bit longer.

01:26:57.477 --> 01:26:59.745
But hell,

01:26:59.813 --> 01:27:02.048
Sonny, do what
you have to do.

01:27:04.818 --> 01:27:07.419
You mean
I can do it?

01:27:07.487 --> 01:27:09.055
I can kill myself?

01:27:12.326 --> 01:27:13.559
Aw...

01:27:14.728 --> 01:27:16.428
Oh, baby.

01:27:19.766 --> 01:27:21.700
But if you
really love me...

01:27:21.768 --> 01:27:23.970
Oh, sonny,

01:27:24.037 --> 01:27:25.771
God, you
drive me crazy!

01:27:25.839 --> 01:27:27.106
You're always
picking on me!

01:27:27.174 --> 01:27:29.308
I can't do
anything right!

01:27:29.376 --> 01:27:30.843
I got to go, baby.

01:27:30.911 --> 01:27:31.944
I can't let you go.

01:27:32.012 --> 01:27:34.713
I got to go off somewhere
and swallow lead.

01:27:34.781 --> 01:27:36.715
I have to tell you
something first.

01:27:36.783 --> 01:27:38.450
What, that you
screwed some guy?

01:27:38.518 --> 01:27:40.819
I don't care about that now.
I got a date with a.38.

01:27:40.888 --> 01:27:42.688
Who was it?
That guy on the honda?

01:27:42.756 --> 01:27:43.756
Oh, my god!
Don't tell me that!

01:27:43.823 --> 01:27:45.224
No, it's nothing
like that.

01:27:45.292 --> 01:27:48.694
I have to tell you...
The gun isn't loaded.

01:27:48.762 --> 01:27:49.695
What?

01:27:49.763 --> 01:27:51.397
I took all the bullets
out of it

01:27:51.464 --> 01:27:52.731
When you gave it to me.

01:27:52.799 --> 01:27:54.833
I thought somebody
would hurt themselves.

01:27:54.902 --> 01:27:56.335
That was
a stupid thing to do.

01:27:56.403 --> 01:27:57.970
You know I know how
to handle a gun.

01:27:58.038 --> 01:27:59.505
Ohh!

01:27:59.572 --> 01:28:02.808
Whoo ha ha ha! Ha!

01:28:02.876 --> 01:28:04.143
Sshhh!

01:28:04.211 --> 01:28:06.295
Well, I thought
I unloaded it.

01:28:06.362 --> 01:28:09.165
God damn! Everything
you do is half-assed.

01:28:09.232 --> 01:28:11.801
Ohh, sonny,
you get out of my house!

01:28:11.868 --> 01:28:13.302
Just get out of my house!

01:28:13.369 --> 01:28:15.037
I'm glad I didn't
kill myself here.

01:28:15.105 --> 01:28:17.639
It'd take 6 months
to find the body.

01:28:26.216 --> 01:28:28.483
He missed.

01:28:28.551 --> 01:28:30.119
Chickenshit.

01:28:31.487 --> 01:28:34.106
Sonny,
where you going?

01:28:34.174 --> 01:28:35.207
Wait!

01:28:43.850 --> 01:28:45.317
Aah!

01:28:45.385 --> 01:28:46.619
You dirty rat!

01:28:46.687 --> 01:28:48.554
Ohh! He's scared!

01:28:48.622 --> 01:28:50.623
You! I hope your nuts rust!

01:29:49.115 --> 01:29:51.884
and now

01:29:51.952 --> 01:29:54.786
the end is near

01:29:54.855 --> 01:29:58.090
and so I face

01:29:58.157 --> 01:30:01.994
the final curtain

01:30:02.061 --> 01:30:04.630
my friend

01:30:04.698 --> 01:30:07.566
I'll say it clear

01:30:07.634 --> 01:30:10.870
I'll state my case

01:30:10.937 --> 01:30:14.840
of which I'm certain

01:30:14.908 --> 01:30:17.342
I've lived

01:30:17.410 --> 01:30:20.663
a life that's full

01:30:20.731 --> 01:30:22.798
I traveled each

01:30:22.866 --> 01:30:27.169
and every highway

01:30:27.237 --> 01:30:29.972
and more

01:30:30.039 --> 01:30:32.675
much more than this

01:30:32.743 --> 01:30:34.677
I did it

01:30:34.745 --> 01:30:37.480
my

01:30:37.547 --> 01:30:39.081
way

01:30:40.216 --> 01:30:44.453
for what is a man?

01:30:44.521 --> 01:30:47.690
what has he got?

01:30:47.758 --> 01:30:50.959
if not himself

01:30:51.027 --> 01:30:53.462
then he has naught

01:30:53.530 --> 01:30:57.500
to say the things

01:30:57.567 --> 01:31:00.736
he truly feels

01:31:00.804 --> 01:31:04.006
and not the words

01:31:04.073 --> 01:31:07.343
of one who kneels

01:31:07.811 --> 01:31:10.562
the record shows

01:31:10.630 --> 01:31:14.216
I took the blows

01:31:14.284 --> 01:31:16.319
and did it

01:31:16.386 --> 01:31:19.689
my

01:31:19.756 --> 01:31:22.858
way!

01:31:29.999 --> 01:31:31.701
Here I come, lord.

01:32:01.214 --> 01:32:03.582
Why'd daddy do it?

01:32:03.650 --> 01:32:06.351
Julie. Shh.
Daddy's gone now.

01:32:06.419 --> 01:32:08.270
But he promised
he was coming back.

01:32:12.442 --> 01:32:13.593
You promised, dad.

01:32:13.660 --> 01:32:15.461
I hate you for this!
I hate you!

01:32:15.528 --> 01:32:17.696
I hate you! I hate you!
I hate you!

01:32:26.773 --> 01:32:28.841
I want to live!

01:32:30.343 --> 01:32:33.178
I want to live!

01:32:49.663 --> 01:32:51.697
I can never make it.

01:32:51.765 --> 01:32:53.799
Help me, lord.

01:32:53.866 --> 01:32:55.601
Please.

01:32:55.669 --> 01:33:00.071
I promise not to try
and kill myself anymore.

01:33:00.139 --> 01:33:04.810
Save me, and I swear
I'll be a better father.

01:33:04.877 --> 01:33:07.746
I'll be a better man.

01:33:07.814 --> 01:33:10.582
I'll be a better
everything!

01:33:10.650 --> 01:33:12.685
All I ask is,

01:33:12.752 --> 01:33:14.553
Make me a better swimmer!

01:33:17.290 --> 01:33:18.424
Oh, god!

01:33:19.626 --> 01:33:22.361
I can't do this to julie.

01:33:22.429 --> 01:33:24.280
We can't do this to julie.

01:33:30.403 --> 01:33:33.205
Oh, god, let me live,

01:33:33.272 --> 01:33:34.573
And I promise to obey

01:33:34.641 --> 01:33:37.876
Every one
of the 10 commandments.

01:33:37.944 --> 01:33:40.095
I shalt not kill.

01:33:40.163 --> 01:33:43.281
I shalt not
commit adultery.

01:33:43.349 --> 01:33:45.417
I shalt not...

01:33:45.484 --> 01:33:48.520
I...I...

01:33:48.588 --> 01:33:51.289
I'll learn
the 10 commandments!

01:33:51.357 --> 01:33:56.762
And then I'll obey
every fuckin' one of them!

01:33:56.830 --> 01:33:59.564
Just get me back
to the beach!

01:33:59.632 --> 01:34:01.666
I'll be honest in business!

01:34:01.735 --> 01:34:04.336
I promise not to sell
lakeside lots

01:34:04.403 --> 01:34:06.605
Unless there's
a lake around!

01:34:06.672 --> 01:34:09.108
I want to see
another sunrise.

01:34:09.175 --> 01:34:11.076
I want to see
another sunset.

01:34:14.647 --> 01:34:16.081
It was a mistake, god!

01:34:16.149 --> 01:34:17.916
I never really
wanted to kill myself.

01:34:17.984 --> 01:34:19.517
I just wanted
to get your attention!

01:34:21.387 --> 01:34:23.088
Help me make it.

01:34:23.156 --> 01:34:25.824
I'll give you 50%
of everything I make.

01:34:25.892 --> 01:34:27.626
50%, god!

01:34:27.693 --> 01:34:30.996
I want to point out
that nobody gives 50%!

01:34:31.064 --> 01:34:32.998
I'm talking gross, god!

01:34:42.041 --> 01:34:43.942
I think
I'm going to make it!

01:34:45.128 --> 01:34:47.696
You won't regret this, lord.

01:34:47.764 --> 01:34:50.566
I'll obey every commandment.

01:34:50.634 --> 01:34:52.868
I'll see my parents
more often.

01:34:52.935 --> 01:34:56.038
No more cheating
in business-

01:34:56.105 --> 01:34:58.740
Once I get rid of those
9 acres in the desert.

01:34:58.808 --> 01:35:04.146
And I'm gonna start
donating that 10% right away!

01:35:06.249 --> 01:35:09.885
I know I said 50%, lord,

01:35:09.952 --> 01:35:12.321
But 10% to start.

01:35:12.389 --> 01:35:14.523
If you don't want your 10%,

01:35:14.591 --> 01:35:16.892
Then don't take it!

01:35:16.959 --> 01:35:19.295
I know it was you
that saved me,

01:35:19.362 --> 01:35:22.364
But it was also you
that made me sick!

01:35:47.857 --> 01:35:50.459
No! Oh, no!

01:35:50.526 --> 01:35:51.760
God damn!

01:35:54.664 --> 01:35:55.764
No!

01:35:55.832 --> 01:35:56.832
Don't shoot me!

01:35:56.900 --> 01:35:59.868
Please,
I don't want to die!

01:35:59.936 --> 01:36:00.869
Aaahhh!

01:36:00.937 --> 01:36:03.072
Oh, no!

01:36:03.139 --> 01:36:05.207
Oh, god!

01:36:05.274 --> 01:36:07.242
You missed him, putz!

01:36:07.310 --> 01:36:09.078
Will you stop it?!

01:36:09.145 --> 01:36:10.278
Hold still!

01:36:11.748 --> 01:36:14.984
God damn you, marlon!
Don't shoot me!

01:36:18.505 --> 01:36:19.872
It's empty.

01:36:23.042 --> 01:36:24.509
You

01:36:24.577 --> 01:36:25.844
Silly

01:36:25.912 --> 01:36:27.346
Son of a bitch!

01:36:27.413 --> 01:36:28.347
What's the matter?

01:36:28.414 --> 01:36:29.848
You could
have killed me!

01:36:29.916 --> 01:36:30.849
I know!

01:36:30.917 --> 01:36:32.384
You could have shot me!

01:36:32.451 --> 01:36:33.418
Yes!

01:36:33.486 --> 01:36:34.686
You

01:36:34.754 --> 01:36:35.854
Fat,

01:36:35.922 --> 01:36:37.389
Round

01:36:37.456 --> 01:36:38.490
Polack!

01:36:38.557 --> 01:36:41.559
Oh, sonny,
you're so mean!

01:36:43.029 --> 01:36:45.797
You son of a gun!
You're so-you fink!

01:36:45.865 --> 01:36:47.465
I'm trying
to help you

01:36:47.533 --> 01:36:49.935
And you yell at me
foul names!

01:36:50.003 --> 01:36:51.236
Up yours!

01:36:51.304 --> 01:36:53.205
I'm not mad anymore.

01:36:53.273 --> 01:36:54.739
I had a flat tire.

01:36:54.807 --> 01:36:56.608
Gee, it was
hard to find you.

01:36:56.675 --> 01:36:57.876
Did you have
a nice swim?

01:36:57.944 --> 01:36:59.744
You know what?
I missed you.

01:36:59.812 --> 01:37:01.113
And I'm so sorry-

01:37:01.180 --> 01:37:02.714
Aaaahhhhh!

01:37:02.782 --> 01:37:05.183
Wait!
Sonny, wait!

01:37:07.704 --> 01:37:09.571
I don't want to die!

01:37:09.639 --> 01:37:11.373
Do you understand me?

01:37:11.441 --> 01:37:14.510
You've got to stop
trying to kill me!

01:37:14.577 --> 01:37:16.312
Do you understand me?

01:37:16.379 --> 01:37:17.313
I understand.

01:37:17.380 --> 01:37:19.014
I don't think you do.

01:37:19.081 --> 01:37:20.015
I do.

01:37:20.082 --> 01:37:22.017
The doctor was right
about me.

01:37:22.084 --> 01:37:23.485
That's why
I couldn't do it.

01:37:23.553 --> 01:37:25.187
'cause I really
don't want to die!

01:37:25.254 --> 01:37:27.589
But what about your fears
and your pain?

01:37:27.657 --> 01:37:29.525
I promised to help you
end all that.

01:37:29.592 --> 01:37:31.627
Will you forget
about that?!

01:37:31.695 --> 01:37:33.962
I don't think it's in
your best interest.

01:37:34.030 --> 01:37:36.097
I don't care
what you think!

01:37:40.503 --> 01:37:42.338
You don't
like me anymore.

01:37:45.742 --> 01:37:47.443
I like you, marlon.

01:37:49.245 --> 01:37:51.146
I like you.
I really do.

01:37:51.214 --> 01:37:52.147
You do?

01:37:52.215 --> 01:37:54.149
I do.

01:37:55.518 --> 01:37:57.453
But you got
to understand.

01:37:57.520 --> 01:37:59.187
Tell me
you understand.

01:38:00.890 --> 01:38:02.691
I understand.

01:38:04.394 --> 01:38:07.095
I love you, sonny.

01:38:07.163 --> 01:38:08.797
I really do.

01:38:08.865 --> 01:38:10.499
I love you, too, marlon.

01:38:10.567 --> 01:38:11.900
I love you, sonny.

01:38:11.968 --> 01:38:13.502
I love you, too, marlon.

01:38:40.129 --> 01:38:41.229
Surprise!

01:38:41.297 --> 01:38:44.433
Ah ha ha ha ha!

01:38:44.901 --> 01:38:47.052
God!

01:38:47.120 --> 01:38:48.987
Make me a better runner!

01:38:49.055 --> 01:38:50.022
Wait for my knife!

01:38:50.089 --> 01:38:52.924
God, god! 50%, god!

01:38:52.992 --> 01:38:56.028
Remember what I said?
50%!

01:38:56.095 --> 01:38:59.564
I'll give you 80, god.
I'll give you 80%!

01:38:59.632 --> 01:39:01.633
Gross! 80% gross!

01:39:01.700 --> 01:39:03.435
here's another fine mess

01:39:03.503 --> 01:39:05.003
I'm into, honey

01:39:05.071 --> 01:39:06.471
they won't cut me loose

01:39:06.539 --> 01:39:08.106
not for love nor money

01:39:08.174 --> 01:39:11.476
I'm a fighter, but they've
got me on the floor

01:39:11.544 --> 01:39:14.879
don't believe
I'm gonna take this anymore

01:39:14.947 --> 01:39:16.814
here's another fine mess

01:39:16.882 --> 01:39:18.616
I've stumbled into

01:39:18.684 --> 01:39:19.684
as sorry a state

01:39:19.752 --> 01:39:21.386
as I've ever been to

01:39:21.454 --> 01:39:24.622
though it's difficult
for some to understand

01:39:24.690 --> 01:39:28.060
I'm gonna knuckle down
and take it like a man

01:39:29.362 --> 01:39:31.729
wave good-bye

01:39:31.797 --> 01:39:33.365
don't try to talk

01:39:33.433 --> 01:39:35.067
what's there to say?

01:39:35.134 --> 01:39:36.368
the words are unimportant

01:39:36.436 --> 01:39:39.637
it's the feelings
we remember anyway

01:39:42.741 --> 01:39:45.243
wave good-bye

01:39:45.311 --> 01:39:46.411
don't make a scene

01:39:46.479 --> 01:39:48.447
just let it go

01:39:48.514 --> 01:39:49.948
don't smother
love and glory

01:39:50.015 --> 01:39:51.783
put an ending on our story

01:39:51.850 --> 01:39:55.220
we're riding
to that final round-up

01:39:55.288 --> 01:39:58.223
this is
where the old trail wound up

01:39:58.291 --> 01:40:00.058
here's another fine mess

01:40:00.126 --> 01:40:01.893
and not my choosin'

01:40:01.961 --> 01:40:02.927
we loved for a while

01:40:02.995 --> 01:40:05.130
you can't call that losin'

01:40:05.198 --> 01:40:08.233
if I knew our love
was gonna end this way

01:40:11.504 --> 01:40:15.940
I'd live it over
and I wouldn't change a day

01:40:20.413 --> 01:40:23.582
here's another fine mess
