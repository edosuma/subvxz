WEBVTT

00:04.138 --> 00:06.907
Damona, you know Irene
from human resources?

00:06.974 --> 00:08.209
Yeah. What's going on?

00:08.276 --> 00:09.710
Well, in accordance
with Welltopia policy

00:09.777 --> 00:11.712
governing
interoffice canoodling...

00:13.114 --> 00:14.782
You and I have
to report to HR.

00:14.848 --> 00:16.750
The recent change
in our relationship.

00:16.817 --> 00:18.719
Do we have
to do this here?

00:18.786 --> 00:20.554
(CHUCKLES)

00:20.621 --> 00:22.990
Damona, there's nothing
between us

00:23.057 --> 00:25.526
that I don't feel comfortable
sharing with Irene.

00:27.395 --> 00:29.663
Irene, let's just say
that things

00:29.730 --> 00:31.799
are getting pretty hot
and steamy between us.

00:31.865 --> 00:32.866
Ah...

00:32.933 --> 00:36.170
The phrase
"sexual intercourse"...

00:36.237 --> 00:38.005
(CHUCKLING)
Doesn't begin to cover it.
(CHUCKLES)

00:39.307 --> 00:40.874
So, you two are dating?

00:40.941 --> 00:42.710
Oh. Well...
Oh. Oh.

00:42.776 --> 00:45.045
Uh...no. You know what?
Psst.

00:45.113 --> 00:47.014
Put us down for
"it's complicated."

00:47.081 --> 00:49.150
Mmm-hmm.

00:49.217 --> 00:50.951
Which we watched
last night.

00:51.018 --> 00:54.422
Who knew the films
of Nancy Meyers
were such an aphrodisiac?

00:55.623 --> 00:57.325
That's a free tip
for you, Irene.

00:59.727 --> 01:00.861
Please make this end.

01:00.928 --> 01:02.830
Damona, it's important
for two professionals

01:02.896 --> 01:06.033
to follow protocol
and decorum in the workplace.

01:06.100 --> 01:07.501
Let's get some lunch.
Come on, sugar.

01:07.568 --> 01:10.138
I told you,
stop calling me "sugar."

01:10.204 --> 01:12.106
I told you to stop
tasting like it.

01:20.948 --> 01:22.216
Morning, gorgeous.

01:22.283 --> 01:23.517
Morning.

01:25.253 --> 01:29.022
Guess what?
I just made us a reservation

01:29.089 --> 01:31.725
for a romantic dinner
on Valentine's Day.

01:31.792 --> 01:34.195
Ah, it wasn't easy to get
a table at the last minute,

01:34.262 --> 01:36.430
but, for my princess,
I makes it happen.

01:36.497 --> 01:37.931
(CHUCKLES)
That's so sweet.

01:37.998 --> 01:42.203
So, two choices...do you want
to eat at 4:45 or 11:15?

01:42.270 --> 01:44.037
Sadly,
we can't do either.

01:44.104 --> 01:45.973
Before I knew you had gone
to such short lengths,

01:46.039 --> 01:48.909
I volunteered us to chaperone
the sweetheart dance
at Dave's school.

01:48.976 --> 01:50.411
The sweetheart dance?

01:50.478 --> 01:52.313
It was either that
or library duty.

01:52.380 --> 01:54.682
Oh, good call on the dance.
Books are for losers.

01:54.748 --> 01:56.350
(CHUCKLES)

01:56.417 --> 01:58.352
How do you spell
"infatuated"?

01:59.187 --> 02:00.921
What you writing there,
champ?

02:00.988 --> 02:03.023
A valentine for
a girl at school.

02:03.090 --> 02:04.425
Ooh!

02:04.492 --> 02:05.493
Who is she?

02:05.559 --> 02:07.295
Emma.
I really like her.

02:07.361 --> 02:10.731
She's the prettiest girl
in the whole wide class.

02:12.433 --> 02:14.335
So, are you gonna ask her
to the dance?

02:14.402 --> 02:16.704
I want to,
but I'm, kind of, scared.

02:16.770 --> 02:18.706
Oh-ho, buddy!

02:18.772 --> 02:21.875
You came to the right place,
'cause Dr. Love
is in the house.

02:21.942 --> 02:23.777
(CHUCKLES)

02:23.844 --> 02:26.247
Now, when it comes
to girls, just have to
remember the three c's...

02:26.314 --> 02:30.651
Confidence, coolness,
and always be closing!

02:31.419 --> 02:33.020
Closing what?
Okay...

02:33.086 --> 02:35.789
...that seems like
a natural stopping point.

02:35.856 --> 02:38.025
Dave, honey,
just be yourself.

02:38.091 --> 02:41.295
Yes, listen to your mother.
She knows.

02:43.063 --> 02:45.799
What's going on?
Dad's teaching me
how to ask out a girl.

02:45.866 --> 02:48.101
Did he tell you about
the three c's...

02:48.168 --> 02:50.804
Caution, conservative,
and chastity?

02:53.974 --> 02:55.843
(SIGHS)
If you listen to anyone,
listen to mom.

02:55.909 --> 02:56.910
Thank you, Mol.

02:56.977 --> 02:59.146
Then again,
look who she ended up with.

03:03.584 --> 03:05.185
Damona.
Huh?

03:05.253 --> 03:07.355
Could I tempt you to join me
for a libation this weekend?

03:07.421 --> 03:09.990
Just say "drink."
Ah.

03:10.057 --> 03:13.093
Wait. Now, you know
this weekend is
Valentine's Day.

03:13.160 --> 03:15.195
Oh, oh. No, well,
I wasn't suggesting
that we, you know.

03:15.263 --> 03:17.064
(MUMBLING)
I know you weren't.
Yeah. Good thinking.

03:17.130 --> 03:19.567
'Cause, you know, (SIGHS)
what with the ambiguous nature
of our relationship,

03:19.633 --> 03:22.436
the last thing we need
to deal with is VD.

03:22.503 --> 03:23.604
(CHUCKLES)

03:25.539 --> 03:28.141
Just say
"Valentine's Day"!

03:28.208 --> 03:29.209
Ah!

03:30.611 --> 03:32.713
So, I've made a little
tweak to the theme

03:32.780 --> 03:34.748
of my Valentine's Day party
this weekend.

03:34.815 --> 03:36.484
It's now a Presidents'
Day party.

03:36.550 --> 03:39.320
Oh, Jules,
did Topher stand you up?

03:39.387 --> 03:43.757
Well, yeah, he canceled
at the last minute.

03:43.824 --> 03:45.125
But this is way more
about me realizing

03:45.192 --> 03:47.361
that Valentine's Day
is a silly holiday.

03:47.428 --> 03:49.229
Why are we
honoring cupid?

03:49.297 --> 03:52.065
He's just
a fat flying baby.
Am I right?

03:52.132 --> 03:53.601
Really?

03:53.667 --> 03:55.369
Because yesterday,
you said it was
your favorite holiday,

03:55.436 --> 03:57.305
and you described
Cupid as both,

03:57.371 --> 04:00.808
adorable and within an
appropriate weight range.

04:02.142 --> 04:03.444
Oh, really?

04:03.511 --> 04:05.346
Is that what
I said yesterday?

04:05.413 --> 04:08.882
Well, I'm glad we have
the Memory Sheriff in town.

04:11.419 --> 04:12.986
So...

04:13.053 --> 04:14.988
(LAUGHING)
A Presidents' Day party.

04:15.055 --> 04:17.991
That doesn't sound...
Too romantic.

04:18.058 --> 04:19.760
No, it doesn't.
We could do that.

04:19.827 --> 04:21.729
Yes, I think...
I think one president

04:21.795 --> 04:24.432
we could honor
is James K. Polk.

04:26.934 --> 04:29.036
Millard Fillmore?

04:31.071 --> 04:34.342
Uh, you can "ba-rock"
my world.

04:34.408 --> 04:35.409
(CHUCKLES)

04:36.944 --> 04:39.146
Damona,
a sitting president?

04:39.212 --> 04:40.514
That's
just disrespectful.

04:48.556 --> 04:49.957
There he is.

04:50.023 --> 04:51.525
Come on, Dave.
Let's get to going.

04:52.225 --> 04:53.461
Hang on.

04:55.663 --> 04:57.965
Wait. Is that
Emma-bo-bemma?

04:58.031 --> 04:59.500
(CHUCKLES) Noice!

04:59.567 --> 05:02.370
(LAUGHS) Did you
ask her to the dance?

05:02.436 --> 05:05.138
I got too nervous.
I don't know how to do it.

05:05.205 --> 05:06.874
All right. Lesson one...

05:06.940 --> 05:08.942
Strut like a baller.

05:09.009 --> 05:10.277
Check it.

05:17.685 --> 05:19.019
All right,
let's see it.

05:32.232 --> 05:33.834
Okay, let's not roll
that one out just yet.

05:33.901 --> 05:37.638
Um... (CLICKS TONGUE)
Let's focus on the talk.

05:37.705 --> 05:40.374
Why don't you hit her with,
"Are you a parking ticket?

05:40.441 --> 05:43.043
"'Cause you got fine
written all over you."

05:44.412 --> 05:46.213
But, Dad,
I don't know how to...
Go.

05:47.781 --> 05:49.116
Excuse me, little boy.

05:49.182 --> 05:51.552
Oh! You are
a grown man.

05:51.619 --> 05:52.853
It was hard to tell.

05:53.454 --> 05:54.922
Still is.

05:54.988 --> 05:56.590
(SIGHS) Ross Kirkland,

05:56.657 --> 05:59.159
the valley's sleaziest
ambulance chaser.

05:59.226 --> 06:01.795
Ken Park, the valley's
tiniest doctor.

06:01.862 --> 06:04.932
Nice khakis.
Did you take those from an
abandoned blockbuster video?

06:04.998 --> 06:06.834
Oh, yeah?
Nice suit.

06:06.900 --> 06:09.537
Where'd you get it?
The haber-douchery
downtown?

06:09.603 --> 06:12.540
Handmade in Milan...
Clooney's guy.

06:12.606 --> 06:15.375
I guess being a scuzzy
personal-injury lawyer

06:15.443 --> 06:17.344
who destroys
hardworking doctors

06:17.411 --> 06:19.279
with frivolous
lawsuits pays well.

06:19.346 --> 06:20.748
Well, what you
call frivolous,

06:20.814 --> 06:23.584
I call being able to
afford my own island.

06:23.651 --> 06:25.519
(SCOFFS) Please.
You have an island?

06:25.586 --> 06:27.721
Kitchen island,
and it's huge.

06:27.788 --> 06:29.557
You could probably live on it
if you had to.

06:29.623 --> 06:31.058
I'm doing really well!

06:31.124 --> 06:33.360
(CASH REGISTER DINGS)
Oh, hmm.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.263
It's my island guy.

06:36.329 --> 06:37.865
Amir!

06:37.931 --> 06:39.867
Hey, quick question before
you install that thing...

06:39.933 --> 06:42.202
How many people
could sleep on it?

06:42.269 --> 06:44.438
Really?
Comfortably?

06:44.505 --> 06:46.707
Ha! (SOFTLY) Four.

06:46.774 --> 06:49.009
What if they were
under 5 feet tall?

06:49.076 --> 06:52.412
Eight people? Wow!
(CHUCKLES)

06:52.480 --> 06:56.049
Good luck suing
everyone in town,
Ross, except me,

06:56.116 --> 06:57.651
because we both know
what happened

06:57.718 --> 07:00.253
when you tried
to put your hand
in this cookie jar.

07:00.320 --> 07:01.889
You got burnt, son!

07:01.955 --> 07:03.724
Everybody knows
that was a bunk ruling.

07:03.791 --> 07:06.894
What I know is that a guy who
went to an online law school

07:06.960 --> 07:08.095
couldn't take me down.

07:08.161 --> 07:10.263
That law school is
difficult to get into!

07:10.330 --> 07:12.866
Only if you forget
your password!

07:14.502 --> 07:15.769
How dare you.

07:17.805 --> 07:19.439
Dad, she said yes!

07:19.507 --> 07:21.742
Yes! You did it!
My boy!

07:21.809 --> 07:24.244
Come on. Oh, wait.
Baller strut. Do it.

07:24.311 --> 07:25.679
(CHUCKLES)

07:27.815 --> 07:30.183
Guess who's got a date
for the big dance.

07:30.250 --> 07:32.620
(GASPS) Oh, my God,
that's great, honey!

07:32.686 --> 07:35.222
Yeah, dad told me some
really cool stuff to say.

07:35.288 --> 07:37.190
Was it, "I got to kick you
off school property

07:37.257 --> 07:39.159
"because you are smokin'?"

07:39.226 --> 07:40.260
No, I went parking ticket.

07:40.327 --> 07:41.895
Oh, that's a good one.
(CHUCKLES)

07:41.962 --> 07:43.597
(CELLPHONE CHIMES)

07:44.698 --> 07:46.534
What's wrong, sweetie?
Emma texted me.

07:46.600 --> 07:49.570
Mr. Kirkland says
she's not allowed to go
to the dance with me.

07:49.637 --> 07:51.939
Emma's dad
is Ross Kirkland?

07:52.005 --> 07:53.807
Yeah, and he hates you.

07:53.874 --> 07:55.543
To be fair,
a lot of people hate me.

07:55.609 --> 07:57.811
And I'm starting
to understand why!

08:02.082 --> 08:05.285
Allison, I think that was
directed at me.

08:13.060 --> 08:15.062
So, because you had to gloat
to Ross Kirkland,

08:15.128 --> 08:16.997
Dave lost his very first date?
(SIGHS)

08:17.064 --> 08:19.132
We just don't
like each other.

08:19.199 --> 08:22.069
We're like cats and dogs,
Hatfields and Mccoys,

08:22.135 --> 08:23.604
my stomach
and your lasagna.

08:25.573 --> 08:26.940
I thought you
loved my lasagna.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.308
Wake up, Allison.

08:28.375 --> 08:30.377
This isn't about you
and your garbage lasagna.

08:30.443 --> 08:32.880
It's about Dave.

08:32.946 --> 08:35.448
Why don't you call the guy
and try to make nice with him?

08:35.515 --> 08:36.984
(CHUCKLES) Believe me,
I'd do anything

08:37.050 --> 08:39.920
to take away
Dave's pain, except that.

08:39.987 --> 08:42.155
The guy tried
to sue me, Allison.

08:42.222 --> 08:44.024
He could've taken away
my livelihood,

08:44.091 --> 08:46.326
my reputation,
my Clippers tickets...

08:48.361 --> 08:50.463
Even though
we hardly ever go.
We should go more.

08:50.530 --> 08:53.233
I think they're playing
the Pelicans this weekend.

08:53.300 --> 08:54.935
What are we
doing Sunday?

08:55.002 --> 08:58.005
Chaperoning a dance
that you ruined for Dave!

08:58.071 --> 09:01.141
Oh, yeah. Come on. Come on.
He's 11. He'll be fine.

09:01.208 --> 09:03.811
Dave said to tell you he's not
coming down for dinner.

09:03.877 --> 09:06.680
He doesn't want to eat?
Oh, my God. This is worse
than I thought.

09:08.148 --> 09:10.383
No, he wants it brought up
to his room.

09:10.450 --> 09:12.285
And he wants extra
barbecue sauce...

09:12.352 --> 09:13.854
...doesn't matter
what we're having.

09:15.723 --> 09:18.191
Oh, and he does not
need silverware.

09:25.633 --> 09:28.836
Okay, you guys know Barry,
the hot guy from hot yoga?

09:28.902 --> 09:31.038
Well, he asked
me out this weekend!

09:32.840 --> 09:35.008
Yeah, we're going to
a cowboy-themed party.

09:35.075 --> 09:37.477
Ooh.
Are you gonna dress up?

09:37.544 --> 09:40.547
Damona, I dressed up
as Princess Leia

09:40.614 --> 09:41.949
to watch Star Wars...

09:44.284 --> 09:46.019
Alone...

09:46.086 --> 09:47.520
On my couch.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.456
(MOUTHING) Okay.

09:49.522 --> 09:52.793
Yeah, I think I'll throw
something together.
Okay.

09:52.860 --> 09:55.729
Anyway, this does mean
that I won't be able to go to
your Presidents' Day party.

09:55.796 --> 09:57.497
(CLICKS TONGUE)
Oh, that's okay.

09:57.564 --> 09:59.266
And guess what?
It might turn out to be

09:59.332 --> 10:01.702
a Valentine's Day party,
after all.

10:01.769 --> 10:04.337
Topher said there's
a slight chance he might
make an appearance!

10:04.404 --> 10:07.340
Oh!
I know! Yay!

10:07.407 --> 10:09.843
I mean, he told me not to get
my hopes up, but too late...

10:09.910 --> 10:11.611
...they're all the
way up here!

10:11.679 --> 10:13.647
Boy, I am fragile!

10:15.348 --> 10:18.318

This guy, Topher, has jerked
her around long enough.

10:18.385 --> 10:19.887
I'm gonna go tell her
he's a chump.

10:19.953 --> 10:22.055
She needs to end this.
No. No!
No, no, no.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.524
You can never tell a friend
that you don't like the
person they're dating.

10:24.591 --> 10:27.360
I don't know
if I can keep biting my
tongue about this guy.

10:27.427 --> 10:28.796
Okay, quick story...

10:28.862 --> 10:30.798
My friend, Tony was dating
this guy, Tony,

10:30.864 --> 10:33.500
who was always hitting
on guys behind Tony's back.

10:33.566 --> 10:37.170
So, this one time,
Tony and I were hanging out,
watching the Tonys,

10:37.237 --> 10:40.273
and I told Tony that
I did not like Tony.

10:40.340 --> 10:43.110
(CHUCKLING) Well,
now Tony and Tony are married,

10:43.176 --> 10:46.213
and since that day I have
not seen the Tonys.

10:48.481 --> 10:49.817
The guys,
not the awards.

10:49.883 --> 10:53.120
(CHUCKLING)
I would never miss those.

10:53.186 --> 10:55.655
There was nothing quick
about that damn story.

10:58.358 --> 11:00.127
You sure
about this?

11:00.193 --> 11:02.529
Trust me...you have to talk
to Emma face-to-face.

Forget about dad.

done for us? Ring it.

ate our house.

hates your dad.

11:38.065 --> 11:41.501
Emma, I know your
dad doesn't want us
to go to the dance together,

11:41.568 --> 11:43.536
but I needed to hear it
from you.

11:43.603 --> 11:45.105
Oh, okay.

11:45.172 --> 11:46.840
My dad doesn't want us to go
to the dance together.

know how I woke her up
this morning.

a Valentine's Day party.

Presidents' Day party now.

12:38.859 --> 12:40.293
Oh, right.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.395
That's why I got such a sweet
deal on my new mattress.

12:43.897 --> 12:47.100
Well, as I understand it,
it's because of some guy
named Topher,

12:47.167 --> 12:48.701

never been told

12:48.768 --> 12:50.437
there's a less douchey
way to shorten the
name, "Christopher."

been awkward.

Hey, did you know
there's a less douchey way
to shorten, "Christopher"?

13:02.182 --> 13:03.750
I didn't think
you were coming.

13:03.817 --> 13:06.553
Baby...all I have
is my word.

13:06.619 --> 13:07.888
And when that word
is "maybe,"

13:07.955 --> 13:09.722
you got to know
there's a chance I come.

13:10.223 --> 13:12.359
Aww!

you alone on Valentine's Day

No.
It's Valentine's Day.

I'll get you some cake.

my night guard here.

that, too.

don't say anything,

20:07.640 --> 20:08.708
Ah, thank you.

20:08.775 --> 20:10.877
But then mom told me
to just be myself.

20:10.943 --> 20:13.112
Ah, thank you.

20:13.179 --> 20:15.948
But then molly told me not to
listen to either one of you.

20:18.485 --> 20:20.152
So, I was standing there,
confused,

20:20.219 --> 20:22.655
when I saw another boy
about to dance with Emma.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.624
Then I was
consumed with rage.

20:24.691 --> 20:26.058
Then I blacked out.

20:26.125 --> 20:28.895
Next thing I know,
I'm dancing with Emma.
(CHUCKLES)

20:30.630 --> 20:32.399
This guy's an animal!
(CHUCKLES)

20:33.933 --> 20:35.802
What are you guys
doing home so early?

20:35.868 --> 20:37.604
Who's this?
Uh...

20:37.670 --> 20:39.105
Hi, sir.
I'm Ben.

20:39.171 --> 20:40.573
Uh, Ben...

20:40.640 --> 20:42.008
Ben Voyage.

20:43.543 --> 20:45.778
Ben Voyage?

20:45.845 --> 20:48.981
Why do you and Emma have
different last names?

20:49.048 --> 20:50.750
You're Ross
Kirkland's son?

20:50.817 --> 20:53.386
Uh, no, he's...

20:53.453 --> 20:54.921
Go, Ben. Run!

20:58.257 --> 20:59.225
(CHUCKLES)
