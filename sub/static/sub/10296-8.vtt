01:16.167 --> 01:21.968
Monday, 3:00,
 <i>People's Court.</i>

01:21.968 --> 01:27.434
3:30... <i>Wheel of Fortune.</i>

01:27.434 --> 01:30.734
4:00...

01:30.734 --> 01:32.901
my time.

01:34.267 --> 01:36.000
Hi, Mom. Where's Dad?

01:36.000 --> 01:37.567
He went to get a haircut.

01:37.567 --> 01:39.434
He didn't need a haircut.

01:39.434 --> 01:41.834
I know, but that's
where he and his friends

01:41.834 --> 01:44.067
like to sit around
and talk about

01:44.067 --> 01:47.200
all they could have been
in life,

01:47.200 --> 01:49.100
so it shouldn't be long. Why?

01:49.100 --> 01:53.100
He promised to give me
another driving lesson today...

01:53.100 --> 01:56.100
unless you'd like
to do it. Please?

01:56.100 --> 01:58.100
Well, what's wrong
with your father?

01:58.100 --> 02:01.133
He won't let me
adjust the seat,

02:01.133 --> 02:04.133
he keeps his foot
poised over the brake,

02:04.133 --> 02:05.734
and he yells,
"Red light!

02:05.734 --> 02:07.133
Stop! Stop! Stop!"

02:07.133 --> 02:09.633
when it's still
three blocks away.

02:09.633 --> 02:12.634
I just know my roots
are coming in gray.

02:12.634 --> 02:15.634
And you know what the most
irritating thing at all is?

02:15.634 --> 02:18.868
The way he spits
out the window.

02:18.868 --> 02:21.634
No, It's instead of
listening to real music,

02:21.634 --> 02:24.300
he cranks up
the oldies station.

02:24.300 --> 02:26.000
Well, don't worry
about it, honey.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.300
Tomorrow, you'll pass
your driving test

02:27.300 --> 02:29.801
and have
your very own license.

02:29.801 --> 02:34.567
RADIO:
 <i>* Rollin', rollin'  *</i>

02:34.567 --> 02:36.167
 <i>* Rollin' on the river--  *</i>

02:36.167 --> 02:38.100
Well, Daddy's home.

02:38.100 --> 02:42.601
I'll go get my jacket
and my earplugs.

02:42.601 --> 02:45.100
Peg, sell the house!

02:45.100 --> 02:46.334
Why, Al?

02:46.334 --> 02:49.667
Did you see a shirt
somewhere you'd like?

02:51.100 --> 02:55.400
Yes. It said,
"Congratulate me. Wife's dead."

02:57.601 --> 03:00.601
Down in the barbershop,
I got a tip on a horse.

03:00.601 --> 03:03.734
It's fate, Peg.
His name is "Dr. Footwear."

03:06.801 --> 03:09.968
Get it? "Dr. Footwear."

03:09.968 --> 03:11.334
I sell shoes.

03:13.634 --> 03:16.634
Anyhow, he's running
this Sunday at Arlington.

03:16.634 --> 03:18.634
The great part is...

03:18.634 --> 03:20.901
he's never won a race!

03:22.400 --> 03:24.734
Al, does this story
have a point, or does it just

03:24.734 --> 03:27.868
sort of go on endlessly,
like our marriage?

03:29.901 --> 03:31.367
Gee, Peg,
when you act like this,

03:31.367 --> 03:33.267
I just want to throw you
on the floor

03:33.267 --> 03:34.968
and make love to you.

03:34.968 --> 03:37.901
Either that
or just throw you on the floor.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.200
Let's get back
to the horse.

03:41.200 --> 03:43.033
They're holding him back
to run up the odds,

03:43.033 --> 03:44.100
which, this Sunday,

03:44.100 --> 03:46.100
will be a minimum
of 20 to 1.

03:46.100 --> 03:49.000
This is our chance
to really make it big.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.234
I've got to get
betting money.

03:50.234 --> 03:52.868
Is there anything that we have
we don't use anymore

03:52.868 --> 03:54.067
that we can sell?

03:54.067 --> 03:56.000
Yes, but who'd want
to buy your toothbrush?

03:58.400 --> 03:59.901
You're such
a big help, Peg.

03:59.901 --> 04:00.901
It's like that old saying,

04:00.901 --> 04:02.434
"Behind every empty
shell of a man

04:02.434 --> 04:04.067
is one of your relatives."

04:04.067 --> 04:06.067
Ready to take me
driving, Daddy?

04:06.067 --> 04:08.567
What's the big rush
about getting a license?

04:08.567 --> 04:10.033
I mean, do you think

04:10.033 --> 04:11.601
that driving a car
is glamorous?

04:11.601 --> 04:14.100
Well, it's not as glamorous
like hitching with pervos,

04:14.100 --> 04:16.267
but I still want to drive.

04:16.267 --> 04:17.634
Well, what about the bus?

04:17.634 --> 04:19.634
Yeah, that's great, Dad,
crammed together with

04:19.634 --> 04:22.801
a bunch of sweaty strangers
who don't speak any English

04:22.801 --> 04:28.100
except for, "Hey, Blondie,
look at this."

04:28.100 --> 04:31.100
Daddy just doesn't want
to pay the insurance, dear.

04:31.100 --> 04:33.000
Oh, no,
that's my pleasure, Peg,

04:33.000 --> 04:34.901
even though my rates
will skyrocket

04:34.901 --> 04:37.400
because you're underage,
and I'm paying a special rate

04:37.400 --> 04:40.334
for the Bumper Car Queen
over here.

04:40.334 --> 04:44.033
Well, I know why you don't
want me to drive,

04:44.033 --> 04:45.934
and it's not
the insurance.

04:45.934 --> 04:47.634
Your little girl
is growing up,

04:47.634 --> 04:49.567
and you can't bear
to let her go, huh?

04:53.033 --> 04:56.901
No, it's the insurance.

04:56.901 --> 04:58.901
Take her out, Al.

04:58.901 --> 05:00.901
Yeah, take her out,

05:00.901 --> 05:03.400
buy her clothes.
She needs books.

05:03.400 --> 05:05.267
Get her some medicine.

05:05.267 --> 05:07.133
When will it all end?

05:07.133 --> 05:09.400
Sure, sure,
I get one day off a week,

05:09.400 --> 05:13.400
and what  do I wind up doing?
Spending it with my family.

05:13.400 --> 05:14.334
Oh, God!

05:15.567 --> 05:17.601
Saturday, 11:00 p.m.,

05:17.601 --> 05:20.100
make love.

05:20.100 --> 05:22.901
11:05...

05:22.901 --> 05:26.901
Al goes to sleep.

05:26.901 --> 05:31.868
11:06, finish making love.

05:36.100 --> 05:39.100
Hi, Mom. If anything
should happen to me,

05:39.100 --> 05:40.334
don't believe that

05:40.334 --> 05:42.601
I jumped in front
of Kelly's car.

05:42.601 --> 05:44.801
She's been telling me
when she gets her license,

05:44.801 --> 05:46.100
I'm car meat.

05:46.100 --> 05:48.100
Oh, Bud, she's just
teasing you.

05:48.100 --> 05:49.701
The last time
she teased me like that,

05:49.701 --> 05:52.400
I woke up bald.

05:52.400 --> 05:54.300
Well, yeah,

05:54.300 --> 05:57.901
but then you got to be Kojak
for Halloween.

05:57.901 --> 06:00.901
Kelly's the worst driver
in the world.

06:00.901 --> 06:03.067
Daddy got a ticket.

06:03.067 --> 06:04.567
Hi, Kelly.

06:04.567 --> 06:05.434
Hi... car meat.

06:07.067 --> 06:08.567
Mom...

06:08.567 --> 06:11.868
Go out and play, Bud.

06:11.868 --> 06:13.834
Watch out for cars.

06:17.067 --> 06:19.067
I can't believe this.

06:19.067 --> 06:21.067
"Let's have kids."

06:21.067 --> 06:23.067
Now I get a ticket.

06:23.067 --> 06:25.901
Driving with
your shoes off, Al?

06:25.901 --> 06:28.767
No. We were stopped
for a busted tail-light,

06:28.767 --> 06:30.434
and then Dad got another ticket

06:30.434 --> 06:32.634
because his license
expired last month.

06:32.634 --> 06:36.400
Oh, Al, that means
it was your birthday last month.

06:36.400 --> 06:38.267
Happy birthday, honey.

06:40.834 --> 06:43.334
You know what
this means, Mom,

06:43.334 --> 06:45.033
is that Dad has to take

06:45.033 --> 06:46.334
his driving test
with me tomorrow.

06:46.334 --> 06:49.367
Oh, Daddy's growing up
so fast.

06:49.367 --> 06:50.901
Oh, get away from me.

06:50.901 --> 06:52.501
That's just what
I want to do tomorrow,

06:52.501 --> 06:54.834
spend the day at the DMV,
eight hours in line,

06:54.834 --> 06:57.767
with a bunch of foreigners
who smell like vegetables.

06:57.767 --> 07:00.801
Naturally, I'll be
in the wrong line.

07:00.801 --> 07:03.567
My line will be the one

07:03.567 --> 07:06.067
where they're barbecuing
the chihuahua.

07:06.067 --> 07:09.334
Mom, Kelly parked
on my skateboard.

07:09.334 --> 07:11.067
Oh, did I?

07:11.067 --> 07:13.567
Good thing
you weren't on it, huh?

07:13.567 --> 07:15.767
I'm going to go study.

07:15.767 --> 07:17.901
Can I quiz you, Kel?

07:17.901 --> 07:18.934
Sure.

07:18.934 --> 07:20.901
Where were you
last night?

07:20.901 --> 07:24.734
Ha ha ha! Car meat.

07:24.734 --> 07:26.300
What a day off, huh?

07:26.300 --> 07:29.300
Next, Steve and Marcie
will come over.

07:29.300 --> 07:31.200
[DOORBELL RINGS]

07:35.100 --> 07:36.100
Guess who!

07:36.100 --> 07:37.567
I give up.

07:37.567 --> 07:40.567
Al, did you know
your car has a busted taillight?

07:40.567 --> 07:44.000
And this is my family.
It's a great life, huh?

07:44.000 --> 07:45.501
They could pull you over

07:45.501 --> 07:47.000
and give you
a ticket for that.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.501
I think they just
give you a warning...

07:49.501 --> 07:51.868
unless they really
hate you.

07:51.868 --> 07:53.634
Get rid of them.

07:53.634 --> 07:55.133
Would you like
some coffee?

07:55.133 --> 07:57.133
Well, actually,
we can't stay long.

07:57.133 --> 07:58.868
Steve and I are going
to the nursery

07:58.868 --> 08:00.133
to pick up some petunia flats.

08:00.133 --> 08:01.634
Real cool, Steve.

08:01.634 --> 08:03.567
Well, it's not
the John Wayne movie

08:03.567 --> 08:05.167
your life is,

08:05.167 --> 08:06.667
but then again,
what is?

08:06.667 --> 08:09.667
Anyhow, your car
is blocking our driveway.

08:09.667 --> 08:11.501
I could probably
get around it,

08:11.501 --> 08:12.901
but I figure, why should I?

08:12.901 --> 08:14.300
Good parking makes
good neighbors, right, Al?

08:14.300 --> 08:16.868
You're not really
going to make me move my car

08:16.868 --> 08:18.767
for five feet, are you?

08:18.767 --> 08:23.067
Two feet, three inches, Al.

08:23.067 --> 08:25.901
Gee, Al, that's about
how far your underwear lands

08:25.901 --> 08:27.934
from the hamper.

08:27.934 --> 08:29.400
Well, you say "I do,"

08:29.400 --> 08:32.200
but you don't really
know what it means.

08:32.200 --> 08:34.200
What are you guys doing?

08:34.200 --> 08:36.200
Studying for
my driving test.

08:36.200 --> 08:38.234
Okay, Kel,
here's another one.

08:38.234 --> 08:40.234
You're walking
down the street,

08:40.234 --> 08:42.734
an old man
with a dollar

08:42.734 --> 08:44.734
pulls up beside you.

08:44.734 --> 08:47.734
You A) ignore him
and keep walking,

08:47.734 --> 08:50.133
B) call the police,

08:50.133 --> 08:54.834
or C) do what
you usually do?

08:58.234 --> 09:00.234
Mom, can we get Bud

09:00.234 --> 09:02.234
one of those
reflective collars?

09:02.234 --> 09:05.734
Like tiny little
bull's eyes in the night.

09:08.100 --> 09:11.534
So, you're finally getting
your license, huh?

09:11.534 --> 09:13.467
You're going
to love it, Kelly.

09:13.467 --> 09:15.434
Driving gives you
real independence.

09:15.434 --> 09:17.801
Yeah, I know
what you mean.

09:17.801 --> 09:20.434
You know, I was really
getting sick of

09:20.434 --> 09:22.067
that put-out- or-get-out stuff
you know?

09:24.267 --> 09:26.267
Yes, that too.

09:26.267 --> 09:28.267
But you know,

09:28.267 --> 09:30.767
a woman doesn't know
true equality

09:30.767 --> 09:32.300
till she has the freedom

09:32.300 --> 09:34.267
to come and go
as she pleases.

09:34.267 --> 09:35.501
And don't forget

09:35.501 --> 09:37.267
to flirt with
your driving instructor.

09:37.267 --> 09:39.267
Then if he makes
any advances,

09:39.267 --> 09:42.267
you can sue him
for sex discrimination.

09:42.267 --> 09:44.133
How I envy you!

09:44.133 --> 09:45.801
Hey, Steve?

09:45.801 --> 09:48.801
You know that
two feet, three inches?

09:48.801 --> 09:52.300
Well, it was just big enough
that a cop spotted me

09:52.300 --> 09:55.801
and gave me another ticket
for a broken tail-light.

09:55.801 --> 09:57.801
Well, I warned you, Al.

09:57.801 --> 09:59.167
You know, me and you

09:59.167 --> 10:01.734
just have to
go hunting one day.

10:01.734 --> 10:05.467
Yeah. I'll get you
a pair of antlers to wear.

10:05.467 --> 10:07.968
I thought we were going, Al.

10:07.968 --> 10:11.367
We'll make a day of it.

10:11.367 --> 10:14.601
Dad, are you sure you don't want
to study for your driving test?

10:14.601 --> 10:16.100
Driving test?

10:16.100 --> 10:17.501
Al got stopped earlier.

10:17.501 --> 10:19.133
He'd let
his license expire,

10:19.133 --> 10:22.067
so now he has to take
the test over again.

10:22.067 --> 10:25.634
And we know
how well Al did in school.

10:25.634 --> 10:28.367
He's a shoe salesman, you know?

10:28.367 --> 10:30.701
I know what you're
thinking, Steve,

10:30.701 --> 10:32.868
but you can't have her,
she's mine.

10:34.334 --> 10:37.634
Till deer season.

10:37.634 --> 10:39.133
Ooh.

10:39.133 --> 10:41.067
These tests are brutal.

10:41.067 --> 10:43.133
Ohh, here's one they'll never
get me on again.

10:43.133 --> 10:46.133
How many feet in advance
do you have to signal

10:46.133 --> 10:48.067
before making a turn

10:48.067 --> 10:49.267
in a business
or residential area?

10:49.267 --> 10:50.434
Who cares?

10:50.434 --> 10:52.367
A cop in a business
or residential area.

10:52.367 --> 10:53.667
Come on, Al,
take a guess.

10:53.667 --> 10:55.167
Two feet, three inches.

10:55.167 --> 10:57.067
BOTH: At least 100 feet.

10:57.067 --> 10:58.300
Very good.

10:58.300 --> 10:59.934
Maybe you'd
better study, Al.

10:59.934 --> 11:01.934
I've been driving
for 20 years.

11:01.934 --> 11:04.734
I don't have to study.

11:04.734 --> 11:06.000
I passed.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.868
I failed.

11:12.868 --> 11:15.667
Congratulations, Kelly.
I'm so proud of you.

11:15.667 --> 11:18.167
Peg, maybe you didn't hear me.

11:18.167 --> 11:21.167
I said, I failed
my written test.

11:21.167 --> 11:24.667
Well, I didn't say
I was proud of you.

11:24.667 --> 11:26.467
And, Mom, Dad got
another ticket

11:26.467 --> 11:27.701
for a broken tail-light

11:27.701 --> 11:30.701
and one for driving
without a license.

11:30.701 --> 11:34.734
Oh, I'm sorry, Al.
Now I'm proud of you.

11:34.734 --> 11:37.167
Yeah. This is
a great little town.

11:37.167 --> 11:39.067
Neighborhood's
burning down, no cops.

11:39.067 --> 11:40.901
Robberies every minute,
no cops.

11:40.901 --> 11:45.534
I start my car,
here comes the Bundy Squad.

11:45.534 --> 11:47.734
Daddy, this is so like you.

11:47.734 --> 11:49.767
I mean, here I've got
this great news,

11:49.767 --> 11:51.367
and you have to
rain on my parade.

11:51.367 --> 11:53.367
I mean, this is
the happiest day of my life.

11:53.367 --> 11:57.234
Well, I'm just glad I could be
a small part of it, pumpkin.

11:59.400 --> 12:02.334
What are you
so upset about, Al?

12:02.334 --> 12:03.934
Well, let's see,
I don't have a license.

12:03.934 --> 12:05.334
What does that mean?

12:05.334 --> 12:09.167
A) better Christmas
presents for everyone,

12:09.167 --> 12:11.767
B) the car will be
much roomier with me not in it,

12:11.767 --> 12:13.667
or C) the breadwinner
can't drive to work,

12:13.667 --> 12:15.000
so we'll all starve.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.934
So there's no problem

12:16.934 --> 12:19.100
with me using the car
during the week?

12:19.100 --> 12:20.868
No, no.
Go ahead. Take it.

12:20.868 --> 12:22.801
Just don't
get it dirty,

12:22.801 --> 12:24.334
because we'll be
living in it soon.

12:24.334 --> 12:25.567
Thanks, Dad.

12:25.567 --> 12:28.200
Al, you can always take
the test again Monday.

12:28.200 --> 12:29.734
You can make it
one weekend

12:29.734 --> 12:32.234
without a car.

12:32.234 --> 12:34.000
Well, I've got to get
to work tomorrow?

12:34.000 --> 12:35.534
How am I going to get there?

12:35.534 --> 12:38.934
Between Kelly and me,
there will be no problem.

12:40.067 --> 12:41.567
Well...

12:41.567 --> 12:43.567
a special thanks to everyone

12:43.567 --> 12:48.434
who didn't get up this morning
to drive me to work.

12:48.434 --> 12:51.801
That's my bike.
I reported it stolen.

12:54.567 --> 12:57.567
Well, I'll get arrested 
for that tomorrow.

12:57.567 --> 13:01.634
Today, I just get a ticket
for a broken tail-light.

13:01.634 --> 13:03.133
Peg, I can't believe this.

13:03.133 --> 13:04.634
I got so many tickets,

13:04.634 --> 13:08.133
I don't have any money left
to bet on that horse.

13:08.133 --> 13:09.667
Well, there's
no rush, honey.

13:09.667 --> 13:11.501
I'm sure
he'll still be running

13:11.501 --> 13:13.167
by the time
you get your license.

13:13.167 --> 13:14.534
Yuck it up, Peg.

13:14.534 --> 13:16.267
Will you get me
some juice, honey?

13:16.267 --> 13:18.267
I'm sorry, Al.
We're all out,

13:18.267 --> 13:21.767
and I was just too bored
to go to the store.

13:21.767 --> 13:24.767
Now I'm too tired.
I'm going out.

13:24.767 --> 13:26.968
Will you get me some juice?

13:26.968 --> 13:28.934
No, I'm too busy.

13:28.934 --> 13:30.434
Kelly...

13:30.434 --> 13:31.934
Oh, get real, Dad.

13:31.934 --> 13:33.868
Nobody drinks juice but you.

13:40.033 --> 13:41.868
Dad, being
without a license,

13:41.868 --> 13:45.200
does it make you feel
like less than a man?

13:47.067 --> 13:50.067
No, son, that's
your mother's job.

13:53.033 --> 13:57.033
Bud, there's this horse
that I want to bet on.

13:57.033 --> 14:00.567
How about lending me
a couple of bucks, pal?

14:06.334 --> 14:09.267
No juice, no license,
no horse...

14:10.834 --> 14:13.634
And thou.

14:13.634 --> 14:15.133
Hi, Al.

14:15.133 --> 14:17.634
Saw you peddling in
from work.

14:17.634 --> 14:19.901
You didn't study,
did you, Al?

14:19.901 --> 14:22.634
By the way, you know your bike's
got a broken tail-light?

14:22.634 --> 14:24.067
Get lost, Steve.

14:24.067 --> 14:25.601
Right back at you.

14:25.601 --> 14:29.100
Steve, wait a second!
I didn't recognize you.

14:29.100 --> 14:30.667
Come on in.

14:32.067 --> 14:33.601
What do you want?

14:33.601 --> 14:35.601
Well, we're neighbors.

14:35.601 --> 14:38.601
Can't two neighbors
just sit and talk?

14:38.601 --> 14:41.534
What do you want
to talk about?

14:41.534 --> 14:45.067
How would you like to increase
your money 20-fold?

14:45.067 --> 14:49.033
Already did. I bet you wouldn't
pass your driving test.

14:49.033 --> 14:51.534
That's a good one.

14:51.534 --> 14:53.033
No.

14:53.033 --> 14:56.033
I am the proud possessor
of some information

14:56.033 --> 15:00.033
that I could be persuaded
to sell to you for...

15:00.033 --> 15:02.334
twe... 50 bucks.

15:02.334 --> 15:03.467
Just what does

15:03.467 --> 15:05.334
the twe... 50 bucks
buy me, Al?

15:05.334 --> 15:06.968
It's the biggest
insider tip of all time.

15:06.968 --> 15:09.467
It's on the stock market.

15:11.534 --> 15:14.033
Well... I'll give you 25.

15:14.033 --> 15:17.033
Deal. I was only kidding.
It's really a horse.

15:17.033 --> 15:19.400
Give me my money back, Al.

15:19.400 --> 15:21.367
He's coming in
at 20 to 1.

15:21.367 --> 15:23.901
See, that's better
than a stock tip.

15:23.901 --> 15:25.834
Stock price doubles,
you just make 2 to 1.

15:25.834 --> 15:28.501
This is 20 to 1, Steve.
It's 20 to 1.

15:28.501 --> 15:30.200
His name is "Dr. Footwear."

15:31.767 --> 15:33.834
Get it?
"Dr. Footwear," see?

15:33.834 --> 15:37.067
I sell shoes.

15:37.067 --> 15:39.000
Anyway,
he's guaranteed to win.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.567
Nothing is guaranteed.

15:40.567 --> 15:43.000
Wrong. As long
as I live in this world,

15:43.000 --> 15:45.501
I'm guaranteed
to wallow in misery,

15:45.501 --> 15:47.367
but this horse
is going to win.

15:47.367 --> 15:49.467
All you have to do
is take me down there,

15:49.467 --> 15:50.667
and we'll both
take limos home.

15:50.667 --> 15:52.701
Well, what time
is the race?

15:52.701 --> 15:54.534
2:00.
Pick me up at noon?

15:54.534 --> 15:57.067
No can do. Marcie and I
are going to a baby shower.

15:57.067 --> 15:58.634
What?

15:58.634 --> 16:00.801
It's the boss'
daughter's baby.

16:00.801 --> 16:03.634
So you can't take me
to the track?

16:03.634 --> 16:05.133
Get lost.

16:05.133 --> 16:07.133
Well, enough
male bonding.

16:07.133 --> 16:09.133
I guess I'll...

16:09.133 --> 16:11.634
drive over
to the gas station.

16:11.634 --> 16:13.634
I don't really need gas.

16:13.634 --> 16:16.133
I just like to drive around.

16:16.133 --> 16:19.133
So, what are you
going to do, Al?

16:19.133 --> 16:22.901
Pop a few wheelies
in the living room?

16:22.901 --> 16:24.934
20 to 1, Steve!

16:24.934 --> 16:28.167
Who needs you?
I'll get there myself.

16:28.167 --> 16:30.167
20 to 1, that's $500.

16:30.167 --> 16:34.667
The family can buy a lot
of nice stuff for $500...

16:34.667 --> 16:38.167
Then again, so can I.

16:38.167 --> 16:40.167
All right, everybody!

16:40.167 --> 16:43.667
Announcement, announcement.

16:43.667 --> 16:45.167
Today at 2:00,

16:45.167 --> 16:48.167
I have a horse running
at Arlington.

16:48.167 --> 16:49.167
I will be there.

16:49.167 --> 16:50.501
The only question before us is

16:50.501 --> 16:53.067
which one of you dependents
is going to take me?

16:53.067 --> 16:55.667
Well, Al, all I have to do
is go for a manicure.

16:55.667 --> 16:58.701
They're having a special,
11 for the price of 10,

16:58.701 --> 17:00.868
but I should be back
in an hour.

17:00.868 --> 17:01.901
Kelly?

17:01.901 --> 17:04.867
Well, two guys
are fighting over me

17:04.867 --> 17:07.367
down by the train
tracks today.

17:07.367 --> 17:09.000
You know, it really
wouldn't look right

17:09.000 --> 17:10.367
if I wasn't there,

17:10.367 --> 17:13.200
but I'll be back
in plenty of time.

17:13.200 --> 17:14.634
Good.

17:14.634 --> 17:17.434
Now I'm going to say this slowly
so that you'll both understand.

17:17.434 --> 17:21.434
It is very important
that we get to the track.

17:21.434 --> 17:23.434
Promise me, promise me

17:23.434 --> 17:26.434
that you will be
back in time.

17:26.434 --> 17:28.133
Al, if it's
important to you,

17:28.133 --> 17:30.200
we will both be here.

17:30.200 --> 17:33.067
 <i>The horses are approaching</i>
 <i>the starting gate.</i>

17:33.067 --> 17:37.067
Hi, Al. I knew you were home.
I saw your bike out front.

17:37.067 --> 17:39.501
How come
you're not at the track?

17:39.501 --> 17:43.501
For the same reason I'm not out
with sleazy blondes.

17:43.501 --> 17:46.467
I'm married...
with children.

17:46.467 --> 17:49.334
Gee, I wish I knew
you were stuck here.

17:49.334 --> 17:51.133
We got out of
the baby shower early.

17:51.133 --> 17:53.067
Her water broke
and we headed for the hills.

17:53.067 --> 17:54.968
We were by the track,

17:54.968 --> 17:57.868
so I figured, what the hell,
I put down $100 on that horse.

17:57.868 --> 18:00.167
That's the biggest bet
I ever made in my life.

18:00.167 --> 18:03.000
At least we can listen
to it together.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.834
Steve, I got to tell you,
I got warned off that bet.

18:05.834 --> 18:08.834
Horse is going through
some tough personal problems,

18:08.834 --> 18:10.767
getting married
or something like that,

18:10.767 --> 18:13.767
so I'll tell you what.
I'm feeling guilty.

18:13.767 --> 18:16.067
I'll buy $25 of your bet
out of friendship.

18:16.067 --> 18:18.567
Lick my shoe...
out of friendship.

18:18.567 --> 18:20.667
 <i>And they're off!</i>

18:20.667 --> 18:22.667
Is that a "no," Steve?

18:22.667 --> 18:25.667
 <i>It'sBailey Boy in the lead,</i>
 <i>with Darling Kim second,</i>

18:25.667 --> 18:27.667
 <i>Mama's Problem third,</i>
 <i>then Satin Lover,</i>

18:27.667 --> 18:30.167
 <i>B-Movie, Floridora,</i>
 <i>and Prince Harris.</i>

18:30.167 --> 18:32.667
 <i>Bringing up the rear,</i>
 <i>it's Dr. Footwear.</i>

18:32.667 --> 18:34.167
I'm last?

18:34.167 --> 18:35.534
He's going to win.

18:35.534 --> 18:37.167
He's last, Al.
I didn't bet on him.

18:37.167 --> 18:39.133
 <i>Heading</i>
 <i>into the first turn,</i>

18:39.133 --> 18:42.133
 <i>it's Darling Kim,</i>
 <i>Bailey Boy, and Satin Lover.</i>

18:42.133 --> 18:44.133
 <i>Dr. Footwear is way behind.</i>

18:44.133 --> 18:45.634
He's way behind.

18:45.634 --> 18:47.100
He's going to win.
No, he's not!

18:47.100 --> 18:48.968
Steve, give me $25
of your bet right now,

18:48.968 --> 18:50.133
what do you say?

18:50.133 --> 18:51.434
O--

18:51.434 --> 18:53.133
 <i>And here comes Dr. Footwear</i>
 <i>on the outside!</i>

18:53.133 --> 18:55.133
Lick my shoe, Al.

18:55.133 --> 18:57.100
 <i>He's making a tremendous move!</i>

18:57.100 --> 18:58.534
 <i>Coming into</i>
 <i>the clubhouse turn,</i>

18:58.534 --> 19:00.133
 <i>it's Darling Kim,</i>
 <i>Satin Lover, and Dr. Footwear!</i>

19:00.133 --> 19:02.133
Come on,
Dr. Footwear!

19:02.133 --> 19:04.133
Trip and die,
Dr. Footwear!

19:04.133 --> 19:06.634
 <i>Now they're in</i>
 <i>the home stretch!</i>

19:06.634 --> 19:08.634
 <i>Neck and neck,</i>

19:08.634 --> 19:11.133
 <i>it's Darling Kim</i>
 <i>and Dr. Footwear!</i>

19:11.133 --> 19:13.167
 <i>At the finish line, it's...</i>

19:13.167 --> 19:15.167
 <i>Darling Kim by a nose!</i>

19:15.167 --> 19:18.167
Ah! Ha ha!
He did it! He did it!

19:18.167 --> 19:20.667
You lost, and I didn't!
Ha ha ha!

19:20.667 --> 19:22.167
 <i>Wait!</i>

19:22.167 --> 19:24.667
 <i>The steward's</i>
 <i>inquiry light is on.</i>

19:24.667 --> 19:26.133
He won.

19:26.133 --> 19:27.133
Forget it, Al.

19:27.133 --> 19:28.234
They never
disqualify a horse.

19:28.234 --> 19:30.300
No, they don't.
Give me 25 bucks of the bet.

19:30.300 --> 19:32.300
 <i>And they're taking down</i>
 <i>number eight.</i>

19:32.300 --> 19:33.667
 <i>Darling Kim is disqualified!</i>

19:33.667 --> 19:36.167
 <i>And the winner,</i>
 <i>paying 2290, is...</i>

19:36.167 --> 19:38.167
 <i>Dr. Footwear!</i>

19:38.167 --> 19:40.100
$2,290!

19:40.100 --> 19:43.100
I just won
over two grand.

19:43.100 --> 19:45.133
Al, I love you.

19:45.133 --> 19:47.133
And you owe me $25.

19:47.133 --> 19:49.634
I can't wait to tell Marcie.

19:49.634 --> 19:52.133
We can invest
in mutual bonds.

19:52.133 --> 19:54.701
Peg, you've got the greatest
husband in the world.

19:54.701 --> 19:59.667
Why? What happened to Al?

19:59.667 --> 20:03.567
Oh, hi, honey. I'm here.
Let's go to the track.

20:03.567 --> 20:05.634
Peg, what time is it?

20:05.634 --> 20:06.968
5 after 2:00.

20:06.968 --> 20:09.968
You know what time
the race was?

20:09.968 --> 20:13.133
2:00, but nothing
ever starts on time.

20:13.133 --> 20:15.234
Dad, you ready to go?

20:15.234 --> 20:16.667
Family, sit down.

20:18.501 --> 20:22.501
What I have to say
will be short and sweet.

20:22.501 --> 20:26.167
You stink.

20:26.167 --> 20:29.934
I left a knife fight
just to hear that?

20:29.934 --> 20:32.167
No, this too.

20:32.167 --> 20:36.167
Right now your daddy's
a little irritated

20:36.167 --> 20:40.534
because you cost your daddy
500 frigging dollars,

20:40.534 --> 20:42.601
but more important
than that--

20:42.601 --> 20:45.100
not more important than that,
but as important--

20:45.100 --> 20:47.767
you've shown me
how little you care.

20:47.767 --> 20:51.434
So tomorrow, when I go
to get my license--

20:51.434 --> 20:52.701
Who's taking you, Dad?

20:52.701 --> 20:57.133
I'll crawl on my face.

20:57.133 --> 20:59.133
And when I come home,

20:59.133 --> 21:02.133
your daddy is not
going to give you anything.

21:02.133 --> 21:05.133
Not a smile,
no money, no food.

21:05.133 --> 21:09.467
I'm not going to lift a finger
to help any of you,

21:09.467 --> 21:13.834
and I don't expect any of you
to lift a finger to help me.

21:13.834 --> 21:15.334
From now on,

21:15.334 --> 21:17.834
we have a new Bundy rule--

21:17.834 --> 21:20.434
every man for himself.

21:23.133 --> 21:26.100
Yeah, Mom, Al passed
his driving test.

21:26.100 --> 21:30.534
And then the instructor
drove over his foot.

21:30.534 --> 21:34.334
Yeah. Al's going to be stuck
around the house for a while.

21:34.334 --> 21:38.634
Drive? With that foot?

21:38.634 --> 21:40.033
Oh, you're so right, Mom.

21:40.033 --> 21:42.167
This is not going
to be easy for me.

21:42.167 --> 21:45.501
What's that ringing?

21:45.501 --> 21:47.234
That's just Al
with his bell.

21:47.234 --> 21:50.000
Daddy, you don't need
the car, do you?

21:53.567 --> 21:55.234
What, Al?

21:55.234 --> 21:57.734
Can you get me a beer?

21:57.734 --> 21:58.868
Hold on, Mom.

21:58.868 --> 22:02.100
I've got to get
something for Al.

22:02.100 --> 22:04.067
What? The garden is blooming?

22:04.067 --> 22:06.033
Tell me all about it.

22:08.334 --> 22:11.067
Don't you know
I'm sitting here in pain?

22:11.067 --> 22:13.067
Aaah! Geez!

22:13.067 --> 22:15.067
Hold on a second, Mom.

22:15.067 --> 22:16.634
I've got to
take this upstairs.

22:16.634 --> 22:17.834
I can't hear a thing.

22:17.834 --> 22:21.934
Al, hang this up
when I get upstairs.
