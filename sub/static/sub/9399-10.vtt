You got Jamie, right?

00:24.190 --> 00:27.318
Yeah, yeah. What happened?
Where are you?

00:27.394 --> 00:29.862
Oh, I got locked in the library
with Lindsey and Peyton.

00:29.929 --> 00:33.831
I missed the whole game. I'll fill you in on
all the gory details as soon as I get home.

00:33.900 --> 00:35.128
I'm on my way, okay?

00:35.201 --> 00:37.431
All right, well, I'm just about to
put Jamie to bed,

00:37.504 --> 00:39.665
and then I'm gonna take a quick shower.

00:39.739 --> 00:42.640
Oh, and Haley, I love you.

00:43.777 --> 00:46.177
- I love you, too.
- Bye.

00:48.114 --> 00:50.344
Do I really have to go to bed, Daddy?

00:50.417 --> 00:53.215
Yep. PJs, brush teeth, bed. Five minutes.

00:53.286 --> 00:56.119
- Come on, chop-chop.
- Do I have to wear PJs?

00:56.189 --> 00:57.781
Can't I sleep in this?

00:58.458 --> 01:01.222

02:35.355 --> 02:38.119
I happened to catch this new artist's

that just went completely viral online.

02:41.094 --> 02:44.325
Perhaps you know her? Mia Catalano?

02:45.098 --> 02:46.690
She's my artist, John.

02:49.235 --> 02:52.534
It's a pretty big office for such
a small label, don't you think?

02:52.839 --> 02:54.272
Well, I've got a good act.

02:54.340 --> 02:57.639

at your great big label.

Let me ask you something, Peyton.

03:13.426 --> 03:17.385
If a great song is recorded,
but nobody gets a chance to hear it,

03:17.463 --> 03:18.987
does it really exist?

so much better than the demo.

03:29.309 --> 03:30.606
- Mia...
- And you were so right.

03:30.677 --> 03:33.043
<i>Only Fooling Myself</i>
is definitely the single.

03:33.112 --> 03:35.603
Mia, I need to ask you a question, okay?

03:35.682 --> 03:38.583
Were you approached by
a record executive named John Knight?

03:38.651 --> 03:41.085
You mean that creepy old guy
who said he used to be your boss?

03:41.154 --> 03:44.954
- No wonder you left LA.
- No, no, this is serious. What did he say?

03:45.725 --> 03:47.852
Nothing.
He said he saw my MySpace video

03:47.927 --> 03:49.554
and that he wanted to hear
the whole record.

03:49.629 --> 03:51.221
Is that all he said?

03:52.532 --> 03:54.966
Mia, come on. What else did he say?

03:55.835 --> 03:57.496
He said I made a big mistake
in signing with you,

03:57.570 --> 04:00.266
and you don't have
the experience to launch me.

- Hey, why don't you go upstairs

07:11.497 --> 07:12.759

- Dan's up for parole?

07:27.447 --> 07:29.813
He pled guilty to second-degree murder.

07:29.882 --> 07:33.716
He served good time
and it's been about five years, so, yeah.

but it's not.

- Nothing.

07:58.344 --> 08:02.781
I just... I mean, I guess I knew
that she was getting attached.

08:03.249 --> 08:05.911
I was gonna say something to you, okay?
I was, but...

08:05.985 --> 08:09.250
I just need you to know that there is
nothing going on between us.

08:09.322 --> 08:11.085
Damn it, Nathan.

08:12.792 --> 08:17.729

I don't... I don't know how to...

Can you just go to Dan's hearing,

to deal with this later?

Okay.

Nathan.

08:56.669 --> 08:58.569
There better not be more.

09:06.479 --> 09:09.414
I will be damned if I let you
steal my artist, John.

09:09.482 --> 09:11.473
It's not stealing if she wants it to happen.

09:11.551 --> 09:12.916
Did she say that?

09:14.020 --> 09:17.114
What did you tell her?
A bunch of lies to make her feel that way?

09:17.189 --> 09:19.555
Like you did with that little actress
out in LA? How'd that go?

09:19.625 --> 09:22.150
Oh, admittedly,
that could have gone better.

09:22.628 --> 09:26.428
See, I heard you convinced her
to quit her hit TV show

09:26.499 --> 09:28.729
in order to tour for this record.

09:28.801 --> 09:30.860
But I guess your ghostwriter
and your cool producer

09:30.937 --> 09:32.404
didn't really work out, did they?

09:32.471 --> 09:37.033
Because now, thanks to you, she doesn't
have a music career or a TV show.

09:37.777 --> 09:40.644
John, you forget, I worked for you
for two years, okay?

09:40.713 --> 09:44.979
I watched you churn and burn all your
artists in your corporate greed machine.

09:45.217 --> 09:49.244
And I will not let that happen to Mia.
She deserves way better than that.

09:49.956 --> 09:51.548
Are you finished?

09:54.093 --> 09:55.993
That's a nice speech, Peyton.

09:56.562 --> 10:00.794
The only question is,
can you back it up? Huh?

10:01.667 --> 10:04.158
You got a lot of great albums on that wall.

10:04.403 --> 10:06.963
But the sad truth is, you wouldn't
have heard of half of them

10:07.039 --> 10:09.803
without the support of a major label.
I should know.

10:09.875 --> 10:11.706
I signed four of them.

10:12.178 --> 10:14.908
You know what? Mia's gonna make it.
We'll be just fine.

10:14.981 --> 10:16.573
Are you sure?

10:17.516 --> 10:19.381
Just look at that wall again.

10:19.585 --> 10:21.985
All those artists have two things
in common.

10:22.054 --> 10:24.648
Great songs and a major label.

10:26.525 --> 10:28.686
I'll be honest, I'd love to sign Mia.

10:28.761 --> 10:32.288
I wanna get her music out there
into the world, because it is great.

10:32.365 --> 10:33.832
She deserves to be heard

10:33.899 --> 10:36.891
and you do not have the resources
to do that yet.

10:36.969 --> 10:38.869
You're not even close.

10:40.673 --> 10:42.470
You're just gonna kill her.

You don't have a choice. I'm sorry.

was time to move on with her life.

- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

The man is a complete snake.
I've seen him do it a thousand times.

16:56.281 --> 16:58.545
He offers you the moon
and throws you out there

16:58.617 --> 17:01.882
and the second you fall short
he drops you just like that.

17:01.954 --> 17:03.387
Look, I don't care about him.

17:03.455 --> 17:06.288

No, we will. You're right. We will be okay.

17:07.859 --> 17:10.454
We'll be better than okay, and you know
why? Because I've got a plan.

then we'll do guerilla marketing,

Jamie looks at me as family.
I was just saying goodbye.

18:23.469 --> 18:27.269
No. You are not family.
I invited you into this home,

18:27.339 --> 18:29.603

most important things in my life.

I can promise you that.

18:46.592 --> 18:48.492

18:49.461 --> 18:50.587
Hmm.

He didn't tell you, did he?
God, that is so Nathan.

18:54.733 --> 18:59.830
Well, he did kiss me and he watched me
swim naked and he liked it.

19:00.105 --> 19:02.573
You see, he wanted me in that shower.

to face, but it's the truth.

We had a son, Lucas, but we never became
the family we should have been.

to influence his sons

27:24.109 --> 27:27.044
when they never even came to see him?

27:30.548 --> 27:32.311
Never even once.

27:37.022 --> 27:38.353
Thank you.

27:39.290 --> 27:40.655
Actually,

27:42.027 --> 27:47.488
it looks here that, Nathan,
you've been to visit your father recently.

27:50.235 --> 27:51.600
Is that true?

27:54.472 --> 27:55.530
Yes.

28:09.654 --> 28:11.281
What the hell?

28:12.090 --> 28:15.082
You went to go see Dan
and you didn't tell me. Why?

28:15.260 --> 28:17.956
'Cause I was done with him
and I wanted to tell him to his face.

28:18.029 --> 28:19.053
I didn't think it mattered.

28:19.130 --> 28:20.597
Well, it did matter.

28:20.665 --> 28:23.998
Just like getting up there and telling them
who he really is mattered.

28:24.202 --> 28:26.670
- Don't you get it?
- Get what?

28:26.738 --> 28:30.572
If they think you still need Dan
in your life, they might let him out.

28:32.744 --> 28:36.805
You know, it's not me I'm worried about.
Or you. It's Jamie.

28:37.882 --> 28:40.442
Dan's gonna try to get to him.
You know that.

28:41.419 --> 28:45.150
The only way to keep your family safe
is if Dan stays locked up.

<i>(THE FILM DID NOTGO ROUND</i> BY NADA
SURF PLAYING ON SOUNDTRACK)

28:51.696 --> 28:53.664
Can I ask you something?

28:55.800 --> 28:57.768
How'd you know who the guy was

28:57.936 --> 29:00.063
and what to do with Rachel?

29:00.839 --> 29:03.171
Let's just say I've been there.

29:03.408 --> 29:05.308
You mean you had a problem?

29:05.376 --> 29:06.468
No.

29:08.213 --> 29:10.238
I'm saying I'm an addict.

29:10.682 --> 29:12.309
A junkie, Brooke.

29:14.352 --> 29:17.913
You ever wonder why you never
see me take a drink behind the bar?

29:19.891 --> 29:22.018
Been sober eight years.

29:23.361 --> 29:24.953
How'd you make it back?

29:25.063 --> 29:27.554
Had a friend. He helped me.

29:27.665 --> 29:30.259
I'd be dead right now if it wasn't for him,
no question.

29:30.335 --> 29:32.030
He never gave up on me.

29:34.806 --> 29:38.606
See, Brooke, I can understand the whole
cutting off Rachel on the business side,

29:38.676 --> 29:40.667
but I'm struggling
with the whole friendship side.

29:40.745 --> 29:42.474
You don't know my mother.

29:42.881 --> 29:46.009
Victoria is relentless
when she wants something,

29:46.084 --> 29:48.985
and it's easier to just do it
than to fight her.

29:49.053 --> 29:51.317
You ever wonder where you'd be
if at some critical moment

29:51.389 --> 29:55.621
when you needed it the most,
your friends just weren't there for you?

29:58.129 --> 30:00.495
<i>I hate to see you go</i>

30:00.565 --> 30:02.396
Can she ever be okay again?

30:02.467 --> 30:04.298
I don't know. Maybe.

30:04.369 --> 30:09.602
You know, what Rachel needs right now
is to go to rehab.

30:10.708 --> 30:12.835
This is the place that helped me.

30:12.911 --> 30:15.607
They've got a facility here,
it's the best in the city.

30:19.050 --> 30:21.917
And I can take her there for you,
if you need me to.

30:22.887 --> 30:24.479
I need to do it.

30:26.124 --> 30:28.649
I have to step up for her. She needs me.

30:29.894 --> 30:33.352
In that case, I'm gonna go.

30:36.901 --> 30:40.132
Do not give up on her, Brooke.
You are better than that.

30:42.407 --> 30:46.275

31:34.626 --> 31:36.355
Oh, you know...

31:37.028 --> 31:38.791
Ain't nothing like an empty gym
when you wanna be

31:38.863 --> 31:40.660
alone with your thoughts, man.

31:43.034 --> 31:45.594
- What you doing here?
- The same.

31:48.606 --> 31:50.301
What's on your mind?

31:50.375 --> 31:54.368
Oh, man, just planning my big move
on your scoring title.

31:56.347 --> 31:59.839
Man, that... That last season you had.
Boy, that...

31:59.918 --> 32:02.216
That must have been something special.

32:03.488 --> 32:07.720
Truth be told,
I took it for granted a little bit.

32:07.792 --> 32:11.751
I mean, breaking all those records
and the scouts coming to see me play,

32:11.829 --> 32:13.490

32:15.166 --> 32:16.724
I wish I could go back.

32:17.535 --> 32:19.696
I'd appreciate it more.

32:22.607 --> 32:25.906

- Is that okay to say? 'Cause I...
- Sure.

32:31.449 --> 32:33.144

This is the best rehab facility in the city

33:06.184 --> 33:08.118
I don't care what it costs.

- Hey.

what happened today with Dan.

And I know you're always
looking out for Jamie, just...

34:07.712 --> 34:11.170
You gotta understand, I would never
let anything happen to him.

34:11.315 --> 34:12.782
Then go be his dad.

Work things out with your wife.

34:15.920 --> 34:17.547
It's really bad, man.

34:17.621 --> 34:19.089
Just talk to her, okay?

34:19.157 --> 34:22.524
And remember it might be better to save
your marriage than to be right on this one.

34:22.592 --> 34:24.117
Okay?

34:24.362 --> 34:27.228
I mean, besides, since Haley's gonna
be Lindsey's maid-of-honor,

34:27.297 --> 34:31.063
I'm really gonna need my best man
to be getting along with her.

34:33.538 --> 34:35.005
Wow.

Thanks, man,
I know that was supposed to be Keith.

34:40.143 --> 34:42.203
I'm honored.

Hey, Jim Jam. Time for bed, buddy.
Here we go.

35:07.472 --> 35:11.169
Want me to read you a story?
How about <i>Go, Dog. Go!</i>

35:11.242 --> 35:12.766
You like that one, right?

35:12.844 --> 35:14.334
Where's Daddy?

35:16.481 --> 35:20.008
Mommy and Daddy are just having
a little bit of a tough time right now.

35:20.084 --> 35:22.314
He's staying with Uncle Lucas.

35:22.820 --> 35:26.051
Is Daddy gonna be sad again?
Like last time?

35:26.424 --> 35:28.756
I don't think so. Hope not.

35:29.794 --> 35:33.127
Daddy stopped being sad when
Nanny Carrie came and lived with us.

35:33.297 --> 35:34.889
He liked Nanny Carrie.

35:35.233 --> 35:40.933
I know this is probably really hard for you
to understand 'cause you're so little.

35:42.039 --> 35:45.634
Nanny Carrie wasn't a very nice lady
and she needed to go away.

35:49.447 --> 35:52.109
I wish Nanny Carrie was my mama.

36:05.029 --> 36:06.087
So?

36:08.299 --> 36:10.324
Don't freak out, okay?

36:10.468 --> 36:12.368
But what if I told you
that <i>Only Fooling Myself</i>

36:12.436 --> 36:14.700

36:17.208 --> 36:20.268
Your record will be distributed nationally

36:20.344 --> 36:24.576
You will stay on Red Bedroom Records,
which John will now distribute worldwide.

36:24.649 --> 36:28.517
You have final say on touring,
image rights and album art,

36:28.586 --> 36:32.682
and you get to keep your publishing,
which means you own all your own songs.

36:33.090 --> 36:34.216
And?

36:34.292 --> 36:36.487
And we get to stay together as a team.

36:36.561 --> 36:39.587
- You did it!
- No, you did it with that performance!

36:39.664 --> 36:43.532
That was incredible. Dude, did you see
his face when you freaked out on him?

36:43.601 --> 36:47.401
It was awesome. He was practically
tripping over himself to give us this deal.

36:47.471 --> 36:50.998
You know, it wasn't that hard a
performance. I meant every word.

36:51.409 --> 36:54.173
Except the part when I called
you a sell-out, not that part.

36:55.813 --> 37:00.079
Well, I think you've gotta go home
and pack your bags now,

37:00.151 --> 37:02.551
'cause you're opening up
in Houston tomorrow.

37:02.620 --> 37:03.882
- What?
- Yeah, and for someone

37:03.955 --> 37:07.288
who I think that you know.
Have you heard of Ryan Adams?

37:07.358 --> 37:09.826
Oh, my God! That's amazing.

37:13.397 --> 37:15.388
Wait, what? What's wrong?

37:15.833 --> 37:19.360
Oh, it's just... It all happened so fast.

37:19.470 --> 37:21.904
I'm not sure I'm ready to say goodbye.

37:21.973 --> 37:23.565
No, you're ready.

37:25.176 --> 37:29.135
And it's not goodbye. This is just the
beginning of your dream come true.

37:30.381 --> 37:34.147
And I want you to know, I am really,
really proud to be a part of it.

37:34.785 --> 37:36.719
Now go out there and be great.

but before you say anything,
just know that it's my fault.

38:54.865 --> 38:56.662
I should have done something earlier.
I should have...

38:56.734 --> 38:58.565
I should have said something to you
from the start.

39:01.472 --> 39:03.702

No.

But she kissed me.

39:47.084 --> 39:50.110
HALEY: You looked me right in the eye
and you said that there's nothing else.

39:50.187 --> 39:52.280
You said, "There's nothing more."

39:52.356 --> 39:53.618
And I have been through
a lot with you, Nathan.

I've been through better and worse,
and sickness and health,

39:55.726 --> 39:57.216

It wasn't like that, okay? I wasn't into her.

swim naked not being into her?

such a weight around your neck.
