00:56.351 --> 00:57.694
I hate when the pools close.

00:57.819 --> 01:00.230
And it gets cold.

01:00.355 --> 01:02.999
And school starts.

01:03.124 --> 01:06.936
I don't feel like
starting high school.

01:07.061 --> 01:10.306
What'd you think about this summer?

01:10.431 --> 01:11.341
I don't know.

01:11.466 --> 01:12.442
It was good.

01:12.567 --> 01:15.545
As good as last summer.

01:15.670 --> 01:18.948
Well, it looks like tomorrow
will be a beautiful Labor Day

01:19.073 --> 01:21.217
with a slight chance
of rain overnight.

01:21.342 --> 01:23.753
But don't cancel your parade
or barbecue plans.

01:23.878 --> 01:26.073
It should clear up in the morning.

01:29.684 --> 01:31.094
Speaking of afternoons,

01:31.219 --> 01:35.553
here's a song to make yours
a more enjoyable one.

01:43.731 --> 01:45.675
Maggie, we should get to practice.

01:45.800 --> 01:48.578
I just feel like I should've
done more this summer.

01:48.703 --> 01:50.246
You did a lot.

01:50.371 --> 01:51.714
I mean fun stuff.

01:51.839 --> 01:53.329
Like...

01:56.044 --> 01:58.877
I don't know.

02:02.450 --> 02:04.360
You stole two beers today.

02:04.485 --> 02:07.852
Beth, stop trying to cheer me up.

02:58.940 --> 03:00.703
Let's step it up.
Come on.

03:03.311 --> 03:04.961
All right, bring it in.

03:12.053 --> 03:14.163
You're fucking fast.

03:14.288 --> 03:16.988
I guess so.

03:18.593 --> 03:20.069
I'm Janelle.

03:20.194 --> 03:21.337
Junior.

03:21.462 --> 03:25.308
Claudia.
Sophomore.

03:25.433 --> 03:27.710
I didn't see you in school last year.

03:27.835 --> 03:30.213
I just moved here
a couple months ago.

03:30.338 --> 03:31.438
Oh.

03:34.675 --> 03:36.700
Are you dating Sean Barber?

03:39.847 --> 03:42.091
I saw you both at a party last week.

03:42.216 --> 03:44.516
Oh, yeah.

03:45.086 --> 03:48.364
You didn't look like
you were having much fun.

03:48.489 --> 03:51.301
No, I just don't know anybody yet.

03:51.426 --> 03:54.003
I'm having friends stay over
at my house tonight

03:54.128 --> 03:55.571
if you want to come.

03:55.696 --> 03:56.939
It'll be fun.

03:57.064 --> 03:58.374
Yeah, it sounds nice.

03:58.499 --> 04:01.878
Beer or liquor?

04:02.003 --> 04:03.129
I don't know.

04:06.641 --> 04:07.750
You're dating a senior,

04:07.875 --> 04:10.366
and you don't know
if you're a beer or liquor girl?

04:12.046 --> 04:13.047
Wine?

04:25.626 --> 04:27.626
What time should I come over?

04:28.129 --> 04:29.205
Whenever.

04:29.330 --> 04:30.331
8:00 or 9:00.

04:31.299 --> 04:32.527
Okay.

04:36.838 --> 04:38.100
Bye.

05:27.588 --> 05:29.432
Hey, what are you doing here?

05:29.557 --> 05:31.467
Mom said you needed a ride.

05:31.592 --> 05:33.892
Oh, yeah.

05:34.295 --> 05:36.105
Can you give me a few minutes
to finish?

05:36.230 --> 05:37.140
Sure.

05:37.265 --> 05:39.665
Thanks, Scott.

06:55.610 --> 06:57.887
Will Rob Salvati please come
to the front of the store?

06:58.012 --> 06:59.021
Your mother is looking for you.

06:59.146 --> 07:01.444
Rob Salvati, please come
to the front of the store.

08:23.964 --> 08:25.761
So are we not hanging out tonight?

08:33.240 --> 08:35.351
I think I'm gonna go
to that sleepover.

08:35.476 --> 08:37.486
Oh, at Janelle's?

08:37.611 --> 08:39.889
You know her?

08:40.014 --> 08:41.311
Uh, not really.

08:42.950 --> 08:44.293
You going?

08:44.418 --> 08:45.328
Yeah.

08:45.453 --> 08:46.862
I think it might be nice
to start school

08:46.987 --> 08:48.798
with some new friends.

08:48.923 --> 08:51.721
I guess I could hang out
with my friends tonight too.

08:52.893 --> 08:53.951
Okay.

08:56.697 --> 08:59.308
Janelle's crowd isn't really
the best crowd.

08:59.433 --> 09:00.343
You know?

09:00.468 --> 09:03.112
Do you not want me to go?

09:03.237 --> 09:05.137
No, go.

09:05.606 --> 09:07.471
I'll find something else to do.

09:41.041 --> 09:42.752
I really want to see her again.

09:42.877 --> 09:43.786
Maybe you will.

09:43.911 --> 09:45.121
There's gonna be kids in our class

09:45.246 --> 09:46.956
from three other middle schools
on Monday.

09:47.081 --> 09:48.758
Yeah, but she'll probably
get picked off

09:48.883 --> 09:50.860
by a senior the first day.

09:50.985 --> 09:53.419
I'm sure she will.

09:56.857 --> 09:58.801
I want to show you a picture.

09:58.926 --> 10:01.537
This is a different girl?

10:01.662 --> 10:02.571
The one l-

10:02.696 --> 10:05.130
you know, in North Carolina.

10:10.004 --> 10:11.494
She's pretty.

10:15.109 --> 10:16.218
Slap!

10:16.343 --> 10:19.588
Should light that candle.

10:19.713 --> 10:22.238
Uh, I don't have anything
to light it with.

10:30.958 --> 10:32.034
You smoke?

10:32.159 --> 10:33.259
No.

10:33.527 --> 10:35.085
I used to like a guy who smoked.

10:37.965 --> 10:38.874
Keep it.

10:38.999 --> 10:40.476
I don't need it.

10:40.601 --> 10:41.877
Thanks.

10:42.002 --> 10:42.912
Emma!
Come here.

10:43.037 --> 10:45.403
Guess what Sara did.

10:49.810 --> 10:50.811
What?

10:54.949 --> 10:56.325
Thanks for waiting.

10:56.450 --> 10:58.008
No problem.

11:08.829 --> 11:11.741
I told my friends
you were going back to college,

11:11.866 --> 11:14.009
and Janelle Ramsey told me
to tell you

11:14.134 --> 11:15.478
that she wanted to sleep with you,

11:15.603 --> 11:17.079
but you always had a girlfriend.

11:17.204 --> 11:18.504
Wow.

11:18.873 --> 11:21.250
Well, tell her I'm available.

11:21.375 --> 11:22.918
She was just fucking around anyway.

11:23.043 --> 11:24.442
Figures.

11:26.380 --> 11:28.712
Mom said you're not going back
to Chicago.

11:31.452 --> 11:34.263
Getting dumped isn't a reason
to drop out of school.

11:34.388 --> 11:36.832
It actually is a reason.

11:36.957 --> 11:38.768
Not a good one.

11:38.893 --> 11:40.569
What are you gonna do
around here, anyway?

11:40.694 --> 11:42.355
Drink?

11:49.136 --> 11:51.313
Do you know what ever happened
to the Abbey twins?

11:51.438 --> 11:53.749
They graduated last year.

11:53.874 --> 11:57.520
I haven't really seen them
around this summer.

11:57.645 --> 12:00.389
But they liked you
back in high school.

12:00.514 --> 12:01.857
No, they didn't.

12:01.982 --> 12:03.726
Seriously.

12:03.851 --> 12:05.895
One of them, at least.

12:07.288 --> 12:08.312
Twins.

12:21.769 --> 12:22.711
Good work.

12:22.836 --> 12:25.314
Remember,
I need you all here no later

12:25.439 --> 12:27.683
than 8:30 tomorrow morning.

12:27.808 --> 12:29.084
It's an honor to be in the parade,

12:29.209 --> 12:32.922
and I want smiling,
well-rested faces.

12:33.047 --> 12:35.257
Just so you know,
you all are invited tonight,

12:35.382 --> 12:37.526
so just make sure
you bring something to sleep on,

12:37.651 --> 12:38.894
'cause my mom's a bitch,

12:39.019 --> 12:41.544
and she doesn't want us
sleeping on her furniture.

12:44.591 --> 12:47.069
Yay.
A sleepover.

12:47.194 --> 12:49.389
Maybe it'll be all right.

13:05.346 --> 13:06.889
Let's go over there.

13:07.014 --> 13:07.923
He's not that cute.

13:08.048 --> 13:10.346
Yes, he is.

13:23.797 --> 13:24.740
Hey, Cameron.

13:24.865 --> 13:25.774
Hey, Maggie.

13:25.899 --> 13:26.942
What's up?

13:27.067 --> 13:27.977
Nothing.

13:28.102 --> 13:30.479
Just gonna get ready
for our friend's sleepover.

13:30.604 --> 13:32.014
Cool.

13:32.139 --> 13:34.950
I haven't been to
a girls' sleepover in a while.

13:35.075 --> 13:37.119
You're welcome to come.

13:37.244 --> 13:40.189
Thanks, but that's probably
not allowed.

13:40.314 --> 13:42.373
Probably not.

13:53.260 --> 13:54.203
Can I have one?

13:54.328 --> 13:55.329
No.

14:03.937 --> 14:05.781
You two really shouldn't
be over here very long.

14:05.906 --> 14:07.316
Why not?

14:07.441 --> 14:10.001
I could get in trouble.

14:14.114 --> 14:16.258
All right, one cigarette.

14:16.383 --> 14:18.374
Then you got to go.

14:33.734 --> 14:36.178
What are you up to tonight?

14:36.303 --> 14:38.180
Probably going to a party.

14:38.305 --> 14:39.748
What kind of party?

14:39.873 --> 14:42.307
Just a swimming and drinking
kind of party.

14:48.415 --> 14:49.591
Oh, you two got to go.

14:49.716 --> 14:50.842
That's my parents.

14:52.419 --> 14:53.511
Bye.

14:57.624 --> 14:58.534
Where's the party?

14:58.659 --> 14:59.635
Uh...

14:59.760 --> 15:01.704
What's the address?

15:01.829 --> 15:04.006
I only know the street.

15:04.131 --> 15:07.231
I'll find it.

15:49.510 --> 15:52.755
The Grand Mosquita
is curious about your quest.

15:52.880 --> 15:54.623
How do we know it won't destroy us?

15:54.748 --> 15:56.716
You must believe us.

16:01.321 --> 16:04.199
Tell us where the treasure is.

16:04.324 --> 16:06.301
We are the true treasure,

16:06.426 --> 16:07.870
the daughters of Mosquita.

16:07.995 --> 16:10.205
Once you find the hidden chamber,

16:10.330 --> 16:12.541
we will be transformed
and made human.

16:12.666 --> 16:14.977
The monster will never allow it.

16:15.102 --> 16:17.446
Mosquita will not stand
in the way of our heart.

16:17.571 --> 16:20.382
Through its bite
it will spread its nectar,

16:20.507 --> 16:23.908
and we will be free to choose
a well-born mate.

17:26.839 --> 17:28.450
You've reached the Abbeys.

17:28.575 --> 17:29.485
We're not home...

17:29.610 --> 17:31.553
But if you leave a message,
we'll get back to you.

17:31.678 --> 17:32.940
Beep!

17:49.596 --> 17:50.506
Hey, Jen.

17:50.631 --> 17:52.708
Whose house you going to?

17:52.833 --> 17:54.676
Janelle Ramsey's.
Sleepover.

17:54.801 --> 17:56.812
We're going to Tom Higgins'.

17:56.937 --> 18:00.282
I guess guys don't call 'em
sleepovers.

18:00.407 --> 18:01.806
We do, but just not in public.

18:04.278 --> 18:07.055
Is it just Kelvin
Middle School kids there?

18:07.180 --> 18:08.223
I don't know.

18:08.348 --> 18:09.925
Janelle's got friends
from a couple different schools.

18:10.050 --> 18:11.059
Why?

18:11.184 --> 18:12.928
Rob's in love with this blonde girl

18:13.053 --> 18:15.353
he saw at Food-mart this afternoon.

18:15.589 --> 18:16.665
Well, stop by later.

18:16.790 --> 18:18.667
Maybe she'll be there.

18:18.792 --> 18:20.692
Thanks.

18:27.868 --> 18:30.546
You messed around with her,
didn't you?

18:30.671 --> 18:31.580
Yeah.

18:31.705 --> 18:34.650
So he was over at your house?

18:34.775 --> 18:37.719
His mom asked my mom
if he could stay at our house

18:37.844 --> 18:39.421
while they visited some aunt.

18:39.546 --> 18:43.759
I kissed her,
and we started making out.

18:43.884 --> 18:45.260
She a good kisser?

18:45.385 --> 18:46.295
Yeah.

18:46.420 --> 18:49.198
What happened?

18:49.323 --> 18:51.867
He just sat on my couch
eating cheese puffs

18:51.992 --> 18:54.203
while I kept trying to hold his hand.

18:54.328 --> 18:55.971
I think it would've gone further,

18:56.096 --> 18:57.306
but her mom came home.

18:57.431 --> 19:00.943
She realized that I had a boy
in the living room,

19:01.068 --> 19:03.412
so she actually closed the doors
to the den

19:03.537 --> 19:05.080
to give us some privacy.

19:05.205 --> 19:07.482
Then did anything happen?

19:07.607 --> 19:10.667
I finally gave up,
and we just watched cartoons.

19:14.748 --> 19:17.239
That was a pretty good afternoon.

21:12.999 --> 21:14.776
Has anybody seen Sandy?

21:14.901 --> 21:16.745
I think she went swimming
in the creek.

21:16.870 --> 21:18.347
She just wants to take
her clothes off

21:18.472 --> 21:20.372
in front of all of the guys.

21:21.341 --> 21:22.451
"Hey, boys!

21:22.576 --> 21:23.985
You can call me skinny-dipping
Sandy. "

21:25.612 --> 21:26.822
Rewind it.

21:26.947 --> 21:29.247
I got it.

21:33.720 --> 21:34.663
"Hey, boys!

21:34.788 --> 21:36.765
You can call me skinny-dipping
Sandy. "

21:40.894 --> 21:43.238
Maybe we should go look for her.

21:43.363 --> 21:44.539
Sandy's fine.

21:44.664 --> 21:46.241
She's probably hitting a home run

21:46.366 --> 21:48.276
with one of those guys
from cabin five.

21:48.401 --> 21:49.845
Or maybe third base.

21:49.970 --> 21:51.801
Probably a double header.

21:59.112 --> 22:01.842
Where are you going?

22:21.568 --> 22:23.668
Come on!

22:31.311 --> 22:32.587
I would.

22:32.712 --> 22:33.906
Yeah.

22:39.553 --> 22:42.063
This movie's not even fucking scary.

22:42.188 --> 22:43.098
Oh, shut up.

22:43.223 --> 22:45.214
You're so stupid.

22:51.731 --> 22:53.528
Yeah, we'll see.

22:57.771 --> 23:00.239
I miss you too.

23:09.282 --> 23:11.045
So stupid.

23:16.356 --> 23:17.380
Fuck you guys!

23:26.900 --> 23:30.078
He usually keeps
extra blankets in here, I think.

23:30.203 --> 23:31.703
Okay.

23:36.176 --> 23:37.719
My brother is such a pervert.

23:37.844 --> 23:39.721
Yeah, he is.

23:39.846 --> 23:40.755
Mandy!

23:40.880 --> 23:42.657
Could you come downstairs
for a second?

23:42.782 --> 23:44.259
Yeah, Mom, I'm coming!

23:44.384 --> 23:46.352
Ugh, I'll be right back.

24:55.488 --> 24:56.598
What are you doing?

24:56.723 --> 25:00.523
I just wanted to talk to you.

25:03.630 --> 25:04.927
Rob, right?

25:07.333 --> 25:08.243
If I yell for my mom,

25:08.368 --> 25:09.911
you're gonna be in a lot of trouble.

25:10.036 --> 25:11.536
Okay.

25:21.448 --> 25:23.006
If you want to sit down, you can.

26:14.968 --> 26:16.211
Go back downstairs.

26:16.336 --> 26:17.545
Why?

26:17.670 --> 26:19.433
Come on.

26:21.841 --> 26:23.818
Can I kiss you?

26:23.943 --> 26:25.035
No.

26:32.819 --> 26:36.164
Have you ever seen
a naked girl before?

26:36.289 --> 26:37.290
Yeah.

26:41.928 --> 26:43.405
Get my brother and your friends

26:43.530 --> 26:46.107
and go find some girls or something.

26:46.232 --> 26:49.133
Try to have some fun.

27:06.085 --> 27:09.330
So last Christmas, my parents
got me this mirror as a present.

27:09.455 --> 27:13.101
I totally froze up and thought
they knew what I was doing.

27:13.226 --> 27:14.569
They didn't?

27:14.694 --> 27:15.794
No.

27:15.929 --> 27:17.572
I just smiled and said thank you

27:17.697 --> 27:20.809
and told 'em I'd get
a lot of use out of it.

27:20.934 --> 27:23.144
My mom seemed really happy.

27:23.269 --> 27:25.547
Janelle, mirrors
are for snorting coke,

27:25.672 --> 27:27.162
not smoking pot.

27:34.447 --> 27:36.779
Like Jen's ever snorted coke.

27:39.953 --> 27:40.895
Me too.

27:41.020 --> 27:42.715
Sorry.

27:48.795 --> 27:50.805
Are you really friends with Janelle?

27:50.930 --> 27:53.160
Are you?

28:09.482 --> 28:10.859
Where's the bathroom?

28:10.984 --> 28:13.361
Um, it's right down the hallway,

28:13.486 --> 28:14.395
through Janelle's room.

28:14.520 --> 28:16.020
Okay.

28:27.834 --> 28:30.712
Let's get everyone to go to
one of the girls' sleepovers.

28:30.837 --> 28:32.413
You just want to see that girl again.

28:32.538 --> 28:35.216
No, I don't.

28:35.341 --> 28:36.774
We can go.

28:39.045 --> 28:40.889
Go, go, go, go!

28:41.014 --> 28:42.015
Go, go!

31:06.092 --> 31:09.837
Hey, um, is my sister Jen here?

31:09.962 --> 31:13.454
Yes, your sister Jen is here.

31:15.768 --> 31:16.911
Can I talk to her?

31:17.036 --> 31:18.037
Mm-hmm.

31:23.810 --> 31:24.852
Hey.

31:24.977 --> 31:26.554
See ya later, Scott.

31:26.679 --> 31:27.703
Yeah.

31:31.451 --> 31:33.695
Do you know
where the Abbey twins are?

31:33.820 --> 31:35.253
Seriously?

31:37.023 --> 31:38.266
Yeah.
Like, where do they work?

31:38.391 --> 31:40.301
They worked at the Dairy-O.

31:40.426 --> 31:42.337
Okay, so I can just go down-

31:42.462 --> 31:43.771
No, I told you they're
starting school.

31:43.896 --> 31:46.107
They left this weekend for U of M.

31:46.232 --> 31:47.375
Ann Arbor.

31:47.500 --> 31:50.731
Yeah, some freshman welcome
sleepover.

31:51.971 --> 31:52.981
Okay.

31:53.106 --> 31:54.015
Thank you, sister.

31:54.140 --> 31:55.216
I love you.

31:55.341 --> 31:56.951
I love you too, but you're weird.

31:57.076 --> 31:58.634
I know.

32:00.113 --> 32:01.456
Bye, Scott.

32:01.581 --> 32:04.281
Bye, Scott.

32:11.157 --> 32:12.900
This looks like the place.

32:13.025 --> 32:14.458
Yeah, it does.

32:15.795 --> 32:18.172
Hey, can I get in
that sleeping bag with you?

32:18.297 --> 32:21.198
You guys can sleep in it
together if you want.

32:38.117 --> 32:39.141
Hey, kids.

32:57.470 --> 32:58.546
Hey, pool girl.

32:58.671 --> 33:00.971
Pool boy.

33:04.477 --> 33:06.754
This party's over.

33:06.879 --> 33:09.040
Do you want to go swimming with us?

33:11.884 --> 33:13.044
Yeah.

33:23.329 --> 33:25.106
You can come with us.

33:25.231 --> 33:26.207
Our bikes.

33:26.332 --> 33:27.333
In the trunk.

34:17.315 --> 34:18.458
Hi, guys.

34:18.583 --> 34:21.083
Hi, Katie.

34:21.320 --> 34:22.496
I can't have guys over.

34:22.621 --> 34:23.965
I'm gonna get in trouble.

34:24.090 --> 34:26.400
What if we're quiet?

34:26.525 --> 34:28.369
You girls could come back
to my house.

34:28.494 --> 34:29.837
My parents won't know.

34:29.962 --> 34:31.512
We'll think about it.

34:35.601 --> 34:38.612
Could I come in for a minute
just by myself?

34:38.737 --> 34:40.137
Why?

34:43.009 --> 34:44.752
I'm looking for somebody,

34:44.877 --> 34:46.777
and I want to see if she's here.

34:48.481 --> 34:49.777
If you're quiet.

34:57.990 --> 34:59.719
Let's go back to my house.

35:15.207 --> 35:17.198
What am I doing?

35:21.914 --> 35:23.506
This is a great idea.

35:32.858 --> 35:33.868
I know.

35:33.993 --> 35:34.994
Oh, my gosh.

35:37.697 --> 35:38.606
Curled?

35:38.731 --> 35:39.707
My hair stopped being curly,

35:39.832 --> 35:41.976
Iike, around the time of,
like, third grade.

35:42.101 --> 35:44.212
I mean, like really.

35:44.337 --> 35:45.246
Not like it used to be.

35:45.371 --> 35:46.314
It was crazy.
I had a 'fro.

35:46.439 --> 35:47.515
My mom didn't want to-

35:47.640 --> 35:48.983
my mom never wanted to brush it,

35:49.108 --> 35:50.818
because I would scream at her.

35:50.943 --> 35:51.986
So when I got my first haircut,

35:52.111 --> 35:53.821
the lady's like,
"Do you ever brush your hair??"'

35:53.946 --> 35:56.157
And my mom's like, "No."

35:56.282 --> 35:58.079
My hair used to be, like, this long.

36:18.804 --> 36:19.747
Sorry, man.

36:19.872 --> 36:21.549
We had to.

36:21.674 --> 36:23.251
Fuckers.

36:23.376 --> 36:25.720
Rob, I didn't throw any.

36:25.845 --> 36:27.855
It's okay.

36:27.980 --> 36:30.505
Come on.
It was just a joke.

36:58.411 --> 37:01.711
Are you okay?

37:01.881 --> 37:03.075
Sort of.

37:09.355 --> 37:10.398
You know Janelle?

37:10.523 --> 37:11.932
Yeah.

37:12.057 --> 37:14.435
I'm visiting the party.

37:14.560 --> 37:15.660
Oh.

37:36.315 --> 37:38.659
Did you see that?

37:38.784 --> 37:41.484
No.
What?

37:42.054 --> 37:43.214
Never mind.

37:59.738 --> 38:00.648
Come on in.

38:00.773 --> 38:02.473
We're gonna play a game.

38:33.038 --> 38:35.015
You have to get in the water.

38:35.140 --> 38:36.539
No, I don't.

38:39.178 --> 38:41.088
Is he naked?

38:41.213 --> 38:43.090
- I don't know.
- Tell me if he is.

38:43.215 --> 38:44.614
I'm not getting in.

38:52.858 --> 38:53.768
I know you want to.

38:53.893 --> 38:54.802
Just go swim with him.

38:54.927 --> 38:56.871
I'm not swimming naked.

38:56.996 --> 38:57.905
You don't have to.

38:58.030 --> 39:00.107
Keep your suit on.

39:00.232 --> 39:02.359
- I don't know.
- Just go.

39:05.404 --> 39:07.047
Are you okay?

39:07.172 --> 39:09.436
Another beer and I'll be fantastic.

40:04.797 --> 40:06.097
Ohh!

40:06.365 --> 40:07.662
Great.

40:24.683 --> 40:26.833
Do you want to swim over there?

40:28.621 --> 40:30.213
What happens over there?

40:31.390 --> 40:32.391
We talk.

40:35.060 --> 40:36.370
Only if you want to.

40:36.495 --> 40:37.995
I do.

40:55.581 --> 40:57.725
Hey, you couldn't do it either.

40:57.850 --> 40:58.851
No.

41:06.425 --> 41:07.735
What grade are you in?

41:07.860 --> 41:10.738
I'll be a junior on Monday.

41:10.863 --> 41:12.797
Freshman.

41:16.769 --> 41:20.748
I left my own party
to come here tonight.

41:20.873 --> 41:22.216
That was your house?

41:22.341 --> 41:23.841
Yeah.

41:24.677 --> 41:26.720
My parents were gone.

41:26.845 --> 41:27.988
I just want to enjoy tonight,

41:28.113 --> 41:30.891
'cause it's gonna be
the last night of my life.

41:31.016 --> 41:32.017
I'm sorry.

41:55.107 --> 41:57.484
We're supposed to be at my
friend's sleepover right now.

41:57.609 --> 42:01.755
But we ditched it for your party.

42:01.880 --> 42:03.023
Really?

42:03.148 --> 42:04.648
Yeah.

42:06.185 --> 42:09.196
I actually liked
when my friends had sleepovers.

42:09.321 --> 42:10.345
Why?

42:11.256 --> 42:13.133
I don't know.

42:13.258 --> 42:14.602
I guess it's the kind of thing
you miss

42:14.727 --> 42:15.869
when you're too old to do it anymore.

42:15.994 --> 42:18.094
I guess.

42:18.630 --> 42:20.908
Well, seriously.

42:21.033 --> 42:22.476
There's something to be said
for all the cool stuff

42:22.601 --> 42:24.545
you get to do when you're a kid.

42:24.670 --> 42:25.946
You start showing up to keg parties

42:26.071 --> 42:28.549
and going skinny-dipping,

42:28.674 --> 42:30.150
you won't even remember
how amazing it is

42:30.275 --> 42:31.385
to play a board game on the floor

42:31.510 --> 42:33.287
of your friend's living room.

42:33.412 --> 42:34.989
Or a game of tag in the backyard?

42:35.114 --> 42:36.256
Yeah.

42:36.381 --> 42:37.891
I miss tag.

42:38.016 --> 42:41.595
What grade are you in again?

42:41.720 --> 42:43.420
Sorry.

42:43.989 --> 42:45.699
You're sweet.

42:45.824 --> 42:49.637
I don't want you to buy into all
the youthful adventure bullshit.

42:49.762 --> 42:50.938
Come on.
What's wrong with that?

42:51.063 --> 42:52.606
It's a myth.

42:52.731 --> 42:54.675
A myth of what?

42:54.800 --> 42:58.612
Being a teenager.

42:58.737 --> 43:00.381
They trick you into giving up
your childhood

43:00.506 --> 43:01.949
with all these promises of adventure.

43:02.074 --> 43:06.587
But once you realize
what you lost, it's too late.

43:06.712 --> 43:08.312
You can't get it back.

43:14.520 --> 43:16.283
Can I hold your hand?

43:18.724 --> 43:19.725
Okay.

43:29.568 --> 43:33.113
It feels like it's gonna rain.

43:33.238 --> 43:35.069
Yeah, it does.

43:37.743 --> 43:39.086
Whoo!

43:39.211 --> 43:40.711
Yeah!

43:40.946 --> 43:42.923
They're having
a drunken talent contest.

43:43.048 --> 43:44.625
Seriously?

43:44.750 --> 43:48.015
Yeah, and the winner gets
a bottle of vodka.

44:18.984 --> 44:21.009
Is there a spirit in this house?

44:29.595 --> 44:32.587
Are there any ghosts
in the house that can hear me?

44:36.435 --> 44:37.527
Wow.

44:39.137 --> 44:41.628
Spirit, why are you in this house?

44:43.175 --> 44:45.075
D-l-E-D

44:50.482 --> 44:52.382
H-E-R-E

44:57.890 --> 45:00.734
You died in this house?

45:00.859 --> 45:02.724
In my house?

45:04.363 --> 45:06.263
H-E-L-P

45:10.302 --> 45:11.402
M-E

45:11.770 --> 45:13.614
"Help me"?
How?

45:13.739 --> 45:16.083
I don't want to help it.

45:16.208 --> 45:17.184
I want it to go away.

45:17.309 --> 45:20.210
Be quiet, or you'll piss it off.

45:23.015 --> 45:24.491
What do we have to do?

45:24.616 --> 45:26.560
Tell us.

45:26.685 --> 45:29.785
B-A-S-E-M-E-N

45:34.893 --> 45:36.737
Basement?

45:36.862 --> 45:37.886
Oh, shit.

45:40.065 --> 45:41.975
You want us to come down
to the basement?

45:42.100 --> 45:44.000
I'm not going.

45:46.071 --> 45:48.972
You want two of us
to visit you in the basement?

45:50.142 --> 45:51.268
I'm scared.

45:52.244 --> 45:53.520
Who?

45:53.645 --> 45:55.545
A-N-D-Y

46:01.853 --> 46:03.130
I'll do it.

46:03.255 --> 46:04.398
I don't think you should.

46:04.523 --> 46:07.023
Who else?

46:08.026 --> 46:09.326
C...

46:09.861 --> 46:12.561
L-A-U-D-l-A

46:16.702 --> 46:17.911
Claudia.

46:18.036 --> 46:20.095
Are you gonna do it?

46:21.473 --> 46:24.718
I'll go by myself
if, uh, you're scared.

46:24.843 --> 46:27.311
No. I'll go too.

47:03.582 --> 47:06.693
Do you mind not standing
on my sleeping bag?

47:06.818 --> 47:08.183
Oh, I'm sorry.

47:14.793 --> 47:15.794
Hi.

47:16.628 --> 47:17.928
Hi?

47:18.697 --> 47:20.007
Scott?

47:20.132 --> 47:22.910
Scott Holland?

47:23.035 --> 47:23.944
What are you doing here?

47:24.069 --> 47:26.346
I was nearby.

47:26.471 --> 47:30.984
I was just visiting friends
over there at the dorms.

47:31.109 --> 47:34.009
Oh, really?

47:34.379 --> 47:37.124
What are you doing in here?

47:37.249 --> 47:38.859
I saw you and-

47:38.984 --> 47:40.027
Us?

47:40.152 --> 47:41.962
Both of you-outside.

47:42.087 --> 47:44.731
I saw you, and I thought I'd say hi.

47:44.856 --> 47:46.266
Well, it's nice to see you.

47:46.391 --> 47:47.868
It's a little strange
seeing you in here,

47:47.993 --> 47:50.103
but it's still nice.

47:50.228 --> 47:51.271
Thanks.

47:51.396 --> 47:53.774
It's good to see you too.

47:53.899 --> 47:55.342
You too.

47:55.467 --> 47:57.833
It's good to see you two.

48:05.644 --> 48:07.354
What are you really doing in here?

48:07.479 --> 48:11.358
Like I said, I saw you,
and I wanted to say hi.

48:11.483 --> 48:12.426
Really?

48:12.551 --> 48:13.460
Really, yeah.

48:13.585 --> 48:14.928
I'm just here visiting friends.

48:15.053 --> 48:17.564
I thought,
"Hey, there's the Abbey twins.

48:17.689 --> 48:19.350
Maybe they'll want to hang out."

48:21.827 --> 48:23.203
Hang out?

48:23.328 --> 48:25.138
Yeah, like see the town.

48:25.263 --> 48:26.628
Hang out.

48:28.166 --> 48:30.677
I think we're gonna call it a night.

48:30.802 --> 48:32.346
Come on.
Really?

48:32.471 --> 48:35.382
Yeah, really.

48:35.507 --> 48:36.950
Why don't we go for a little bit?

48:37.075 --> 48:39.086
We're not supposed to leave the gym.

48:39.211 --> 48:40.754
Who cares?

48:40.879 --> 48:42.676
They're watching doors.

48:47.085 --> 48:48.780
Now, that just makes it more fun.

50:51.176 --> 50:52.352
Do you think we're in trouble?

50:52.477 --> 50:54.240
- I doubt it.
- We're fine.

50:58.216 --> 51:00.794
So how was the rest
of high school for you guys?

51:00.919 --> 51:03.430
Um, good, I guess.

51:03.555 --> 51:04.664
Good.

51:04.789 --> 51:06.166
How about you?

51:06.291 --> 51:08.568
This is your last year
of college, right?

51:08.693 --> 51:12.539
Yeah, but I don't think
I'm going back to Chicago.

51:12.664 --> 51:14.508
You're not gonna finish?

51:14.633 --> 51:15.809
You're almost done.

51:15.934 --> 51:18.612
I don't know.

51:18.737 --> 51:20.347
I can't wait to be done with school.

51:20.472 --> 51:22.649
Four years.
That's it.

51:22.774 --> 51:24.503
Yeah, I used to like it more, but-

51:28.113 --> 51:29.656
You cold?

51:29.781 --> 51:30.941
Yeah.

51:33.685 --> 51:35.516
Thanks.

51:38.056 --> 51:41.168
When do you have to meet up
with your friends?

51:41.293 --> 51:42.954
Oh, there's no rush.

52:08.353 --> 52:10.830
Can I see your keychain?

52:10.955 --> 52:11.956
Why?

52:12.590 --> 52:14.990
It's the girl you slept with, right?

52:21.333 --> 52:22.833
Yeah.

52:23.068 --> 52:24.611
Let me see what she looks like.

52:24.736 --> 52:26.169
Okay.

52:35.447 --> 52:36.812
She's very pretty.

52:38.683 --> 52:39.843
She is.

53:02.440 --> 53:05.185
I never slept with her.

53:05.310 --> 53:06.920
I know.

53:07.045 --> 53:08.455
I could tell that you knew.

53:08.580 --> 53:10.056
That's why I'm telling you.

53:10.181 --> 53:11.681
Okay.

53:14.018 --> 53:17.030
You know, tonight
is the best night of the year

53:17.155 --> 53:18.179
to see a meteor.

53:19.257 --> 53:21.001
I haven't seen a single one.

53:21.126 --> 53:22.902
You have to know how to look.

53:23.027 --> 53:23.937
How?

53:24.062 --> 53:25.620
Come here.

53:27.031 --> 53:29.591
You lay down
with your feet pointed north.

53:31.770 --> 53:36.775
Now watch there,
and eventually you'll see one.

53:46.518 --> 53:48.611
Have you found
your supermarket girl?

53:50.355 --> 53:51.379
Not yet.

53:55.059 --> 53:56.770
You ever think about a person so much

53:56.895 --> 53:59.039
that you start to believe
that they might know

53:59.164 --> 54:00.507
that you're thinking about them?

54:00.632 --> 54:02.793
When I was a kid, maybe.

54:04.169 --> 54:07.347
Tell me about it.

54:07.472 --> 54:10.917
I was about 1 0 or 1 1, I think,
and I was on vacation

54:11.042 --> 54:12.485
with my friend John and his parents

54:12.610 --> 54:15.021
on Mackinac lsland.

54:15.146 --> 54:17.390
We saw these two girls
riding past us on their bikes,

54:17.515 --> 54:19.959
so me and John followed them.

54:20.084 --> 54:23.697
We stayed about 50 feet
behind them all afternoon

54:23.822 --> 54:27.500
until his dad found us
and made us leave on the boat.

54:27.625 --> 54:29.069
We never said a word to them,

54:29.194 --> 54:32.639
but the girl that was mine
kept looking at me and smiling.

54:32.764 --> 54:35.975
And for at least a week or two
after that

54:36.100 --> 54:37.777
when I was going to sleep,

54:37.902 --> 54:39.612
I'd think about her
and imagine that she knew

54:39.737 --> 54:41.614
how much I liked her.

54:41.739 --> 54:44.284
Did you ever see her again?

54:44.409 --> 54:45.509
No.

54:46.244 --> 54:48.235
She's like the girl
from the supermarket.

54:51.950 --> 54:53.577
I got to go.

54:56.120 --> 54:57.764
Have fun.

54:57.889 --> 54:59.789
I hope you find her.

55:19.644 --> 55:21.669
It's actually kind of cold down here.

55:31.489 --> 55:33.218
Let's sit here.

55:49.374 --> 55:50.617
So you look over my shoulder

55:50.742 --> 55:51.985
and tell me if you see the ghost,

55:52.110 --> 55:54.654
and I'll do the same for you.

55:54.779 --> 55:56.489
I have to trust you?

55:56.614 --> 55:57.638
That's bad.

56:53.838 --> 56:56.216
I want to kiss you.

56:56.341 --> 56:57.467
But I can't.

57:04.148 --> 57:06.860
Have you ever breathed through
another person before?

57:06.985 --> 57:08.194
What are you talking about?

57:08.319 --> 57:10.930
Breathing.
Not kissing.

57:11.055 --> 57:12.155
No.

57:12.757 --> 57:16.236
Open your mouth.

57:16.361 --> 57:18.329
Lean in closer to me.

57:20.198 --> 57:21.875
Just relax.

57:22.000 --> 57:23.490
Let me do it.

57:52.163 --> 57:53.494
You're fucking horrible.

58:09.747 --> 58:12.025
You have to share this with me.

58:12.150 --> 58:13.960
I can't drink anymore.

58:14.085 --> 58:17.430
We'll have it for breakfast.

58:17.555 --> 58:18.698
Okay.

58:18.823 --> 58:20.266
You promise?

58:20.391 --> 58:21.367
Yeah.

58:21.492 --> 58:22.857
Breakfast.

58:27.965 --> 58:29.976
Have you seen Beth?

58:30.101 --> 58:32.245
- Your friend?
- Yeah.

58:32.370 --> 58:33.997
I haven't seen her in a while.

58:36.741 --> 58:38.868
I'll be back, okay?

59:02.467 --> 59:05.011
I thought you might come here.

59:05.136 --> 59:07.313
It's kind of my last shot.

59:07.438 --> 59:08.615
You're being a dumb-ass, you know.

59:08.740 --> 59:10.183
This girl isn't just gonna disappear

59:10.308 --> 59:11.985
from the Earth when the sun comes up.

59:12.110 --> 59:13.620
Maybe she'll be in school.

59:13.745 --> 59:15.655
Or maybe she'll be at the parade.

59:15.780 --> 59:17.077
What if she's not?

59:20.351 --> 59:21.352
Oh, well.

59:42.440 --> 59:43.940
Shit.

01:00:19.377 --> 01:00:20.969
Bitch.

01:00:32.023 --> 01:00:33.991
That's not what I expected.

01:00:40.097 --> 01:00:41.641
What happened?

01:00:41.766 --> 01:00:42.742
It's nothing.

01:00:42.867 --> 01:00:43.868
Let me see.

01:00:44.969 --> 01:00:45.945
You cut yourself.

01:00:46.070 --> 01:00:47.747
It's fine.

01:00:47.872 --> 01:00:50.316
You should wash it out.

01:00:50.441 --> 01:00:51.601
I guess.

01:00:57.315 --> 01:01:00.682
Did you ever think that...

01:01:02.854 --> 01:01:04.554
What?

01:01:05.723 --> 01:01:07.213
Nothing.

01:01:17.001 --> 01:01:18.277
Hey, Jen.

01:01:18.402 --> 01:01:20.393
What the hell are you guys
doing out here?

01:01:22.607 --> 01:01:24.350
I don't know.

01:01:24.475 --> 01:01:25.952
What are you doing?

01:01:26.077 --> 01:01:29.689
We're going to some tunnels
one of the girls heard about.

01:01:29.814 --> 01:01:31.907
It's a make-out maze.

01:01:32.717 --> 01:01:33.741
Can we go?

01:01:34.619 --> 01:01:36.119
Um...

01:01:48.332 --> 01:01:49.642
Be careful, Ady.

01:01:49.767 --> 01:01:51.132
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:01:54.272 --> 01:01:55.515
Do you have any change on you?

01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:58.084
What, like a quarter?

01:01:58.209 --> 01:01:59.301
No, a penny.

01:02:11.255 --> 01:02:12.198
Splash!

01:02:12.323 --> 01:02:13.232
Was that a wish?

01:02:13.357 --> 01:02:14.867
Could be.

01:02:14.992 --> 01:02:16.969
I don't think swimming pools
have the same magical effects

01:02:17.094 --> 01:02:18.571
as a wishing well.

01:02:18.696 --> 01:02:21.164
You don't know very much.

01:02:27.204 --> 01:02:29.849
Tell me if it works out for you.

01:02:29.974 --> 01:02:31.818
I will.

01:02:31.943 --> 01:02:34.173
You came here to see us, didn't you?

01:02:37.882 --> 01:02:39.543
Tell the truth.

01:02:43.187 --> 01:02:44.188
Yeah.

01:02:55.900 --> 01:02:57.390
Why?

01:03:01.072 --> 01:03:03.082
I remember this moment.

01:03:03.207 --> 01:03:06.586
I remember talking to you both

01:03:06.711 --> 01:03:10.389
and thinking that I liked you.

01:03:10.514 --> 01:03:11.791
You had a crush on me?

01:03:11.916 --> 01:03:13.016
No.

01:03:13.317 --> 01:03:14.260
Yeah.

01:03:14.385 --> 01:03:16.863
I mean, both of you.

01:03:16.988 --> 01:03:17.989
I...

01:03:18.489 --> 01:03:20.199
I had a crush on both of you.

01:03:20.324 --> 01:03:22.034
You can't like both of us.

01:03:22.159 --> 01:03:24.337
You were always together.

01:03:24.462 --> 01:03:25.738
We talked as a group.

01:03:25.863 --> 01:03:27.640
It's totally possible.

01:03:27.765 --> 01:03:29.508
We're not the same person.

01:03:29.633 --> 01:03:31.944
Even if we both liked you,
we're not gonna triple date...

01:03:32.069 --> 01:03:34.213
Ménage à twin...

01:03:34.338 --> 01:03:35.481
Whatever.

01:03:35.606 --> 01:03:36.883
I know.

01:03:37.008 --> 01:03:38.417
I know.

01:03:38.542 --> 01:03:39.452
What did you expect?

01:03:39.577 --> 01:03:42.154
Some kind of fantasy twin blow job?

01:03:42.279 --> 01:03:45.544
No, I didn't expect that, but...

01:03:49.687 --> 01:03:53.065
I'm sorry.
I know this is weird.

01:03:53.190 --> 01:03:54.567
I've just been kind of a mess lately.

01:03:54.692 --> 01:03:57.236
And I saw this picture,

01:03:57.361 --> 01:03:59.372
and it reminded me
of the fact that there might be

01:03:59.497 --> 01:04:02.575
someone else out there
besides Kerri Sullivan

01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:06.329
who I like or have
some kind of connection with.

01:04:10.674 --> 01:04:12.301
I'm not stalking you.

01:04:14.211 --> 01:04:16.455
Legally, I'm pretty sure I'm not.

01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:17.990
I just like you.

01:04:18.115 --> 01:04:21.928
And as fourth-grade as that sounds,

01:04:22.053 --> 01:04:23.111
it's the truth.

01:04:33.697 --> 01:04:35.597
Buy us some beer and we're cool.

01:04:36.967 --> 01:04:38.400
Okay.

01:04:58.189 --> 01:04:59.213
Hi.

01:05:01.792 --> 01:05:03.987
I hope you weren't taking
advantage of my friend.

01:05:04.662 --> 01:05:05.762
No.

01:05:06.130 --> 01:05:08.997
Good, 'cause I was ready
to beat the shit out of you.

01:05:10.201 --> 01:05:12.192
You probably could.

01:05:17.308 --> 01:05:19.418
Hi, Maggie.

01:05:19.543 --> 01:05:21.534
Hi, Beth.

01:05:25.850 --> 01:05:27.477
This is my new boyfriend.

01:05:30.154 --> 01:05:31.678
I see that.

01:05:36.127 --> 01:05:37.492
He's a good kisser.

01:05:39.997 --> 01:05:41.897
Is he?

01:05:42.666 --> 01:05:44.166
Yeah.

01:05:45.503 --> 01:05:46.504
You kissed her?

01:05:54.345 --> 01:05:56.609
I'll let you try him out if you want.

01:05:58.382 --> 01:06:00.316
I don't know about that.

01:06:06.257 --> 01:06:07.281
Come sit here.

01:07:56.166 --> 01:07:58.344
What happened to your face?

01:07:58.469 --> 01:08:00.279
I got hit.

01:08:00.404 --> 01:08:01.904
Why?

01:08:02.573 --> 01:08:04.564
I kissed another girl's boyfriend.

01:08:08.379 --> 01:08:09.403
You did?

01:08:21.492 --> 01:08:23.002
You breaking up with me?

01:08:23.127 --> 01:08:25.118
Probably.

01:08:32.435 --> 01:08:35.337
Did you know that Janelle Ramsey
keeps a diary?

01:08:40.644 --> 01:08:43.703
Who the fuck wears Mickey Mouse
underwear anyway?

01:08:47.984 --> 01:08:49.212
I'm sorry.

01:08:49.987 --> 01:08:50.988
Yeah.

01:08:58.028 --> 01:09:01.573
Do you want to come inside?

01:09:01.698 --> 01:09:03.894
No, I feel like running.

01:09:12.910 --> 01:09:14.138
Come on.

01:09:20.417 --> 01:09:21.327
If I spend the night,

01:09:21.452 --> 01:09:24.011
it doesn't mean
that we're staying together.

01:09:25.589 --> 01:09:26.988
I know.

01:09:57.488 --> 01:09:59.046
Do you like me?

01:09:59.656 --> 01:10:01.356
What?

01:10:01.925 --> 01:10:03.402
Do you like Beth?

01:10:03.527 --> 01:10:06.189
Maggie, don't get weird.

01:10:08.432 --> 01:10:10.127
I think I just fucked up.

01:10:12.002 --> 01:10:13.469
Great.

01:10:14.104 --> 01:10:15.581
Beth.

01:10:15.706 --> 01:10:17.349
Wake up.

01:10:17.474 --> 01:10:19.032
We got to go.

01:10:34.591 --> 01:10:36.957
You guys want to hang out more?

01:10:40.531 --> 01:10:42.055
We could all go back to my house.

01:11:37.554 --> 01:11:38.831
Good luck.

01:11:38.956 --> 01:11:41.056
You too.

01:11:41.692 --> 01:11:43.319
Don't get lost.

01:12:46.356 --> 01:12:47.456
Hi.

01:12:48.025 --> 01:12:49.026
Hi.

01:12:51.562 --> 01:12:53.553
Do you want to sit with me?

01:12:55.065 --> 01:12:58.644
I actually have a girlfriend, so...

01:12:58.769 --> 01:12:59.869
Oh.

01:13:02.239 --> 01:13:04.230
I understand.

01:13:09.746 --> 01:13:12.891
I hope you find somebody
to sit with you.

01:13:13.016 --> 01:13:14.347
Thanks.

01:14:38.669 --> 01:14:40.967
It's too bad you never said
anything back then.

01:14:42.606 --> 01:14:44.106
Why?

01:14:44.541 --> 01:14:46.805
One of us had a big crush on you.

01:14:48.979 --> 01:14:49.988
One of you?

01:14:50.113 --> 01:14:52.047
Yeah, one of us.

01:14:54.284 --> 01:14:56.395
Well, which one of you liked me?

01:14:56.520 --> 01:14:59.498
Which one of us do you like?

01:14:59.623 --> 01:15:02.100
You can't say both.
It's not fair.

01:15:02.225 --> 01:15:03.769
Well, what if it's true?

01:15:03.894 --> 01:15:07.239
Then we're not interested,
no matter what.

01:15:07.364 --> 01:15:08.763
Okay.

01:15:17.307 --> 01:15:19.284
This is torture.

01:15:19.409 --> 01:15:20.899
Bathroom.

01:15:38.929 --> 01:15:40.973
Do you remember this moment?

01:15:41.098 --> 01:15:42.007
What about it?

01:15:42.132 --> 01:15:44.543
You said something crappy
about Kerri,

01:15:44.668 --> 01:15:47.579
and I got kind of upset.

01:15:47.704 --> 01:15:49.448
I'm sure I didn't mean to upset you.

01:15:49.573 --> 01:15:50.482
I know.

01:15:50.607 --> 01:15:53.752
It just seemed like you were
trying to tell me something,

01:15:53.877 --> 01:15:56.521
Iike you knew something
about her that I didn't know.

01:15:56.646 --> 01:15:59.858
Oh, I don't remember.

01:15:59.983 --> 01:16:02.361
Sometimes I just spit things out.

01:16:02.486 --> 01:16:04.630
I'm pretty intuitive.

01:16:04.755 --> 01:16:07.933
It's the twin thing, I guess.

01:16:08.058 --> 01:16:10.669
What did your intuition tell you?

01:16:10.794 --> 01:16:13.472
She probably wasn't right for you.

01:16:13.597 --> 01:16:14.689
But you know that.

01:16:18.368 --> 01:16:20.302
I should've dated one of you.

01:16:21.571 --> 01:16:22.881
Do you know how many guys

01:16:23.006 --> 01:16:25.884
have pulled this twin
fantasy bullshit?

01:16:26.009 --> 01:16:28.153
I really do like you.

01:16:28.278 --> 01:16:30.022
I don't get it.

01:16:30.147 --> 01:16:32.891
You're not a dumb person,
but you just sound so stupid.

01:16:33.016 --> 01:16:34.993
You think sleeping with me
and my sister

01:16:35.118 --> 01:16:37.929
would make you happy
and solve all your problems.

01:16:38.054 --> 01:16:39.612
It might.

01:16:44.594 --> 01:16:47.773
Seriously, Ady, I like you.

01:16:47.898 --> 01:16:50.242
Both of us.

01:16:50.367 --> 01:16:51.467
No.

01:17:13.356 --> 01:17:17.224
I guess it's bedtime.

01:19:41.438 --> 01:19:43.565
It's the boy from the supermarket.

01:19:44.341 --> 01:19:45.441
Hi.

01:19:50.780 --> 01:19:52.270
You having fun here?

01:19:54.084 --> 01:19:54.993
Yeah.

01:19:55.118 --> 01:19:56.618
You?

01:19:56.853 --> 01:19:58.353
Sure.

01:19:58.722 --> 01:19:59.798
Want one?

01:19:59.923 --> 01:20:01.447
No, thanks.

01:20:05.195 --> 01:20:08.995
You were totally
checking me out this afternoon.

01:20:19.476 --> 01:20:21.501
I love this place.

01:20:31.087 --> 01:20:32.597
What are you doing?

01:20:32.722 --> 01:20:35.987
It's so I can see you.

01:20:37.761 --> 01:20:40.205
You're not supposed to see
what you're doing here.

01:20:40.330 --> 01:20:41.763
It's supposed to be dark.

01:20:58.948 --> 01:21:00.648
Sorry.

01:21:01.151 --> 01:21:02.360
You didn't do anything wrong.

01:21:02.485 --> 01:21:05.597
I mean for not-

01:21:05.722 --> 01:21:07.246
I'm sorry.

01:21:21.704 --> 01:21:23.581
Did you kiss anybody?

01:21:23.706 --> 01:21:25.606
Almost.

01:21:25.975 --> 01:21:27.652
Was she cute?

01:21:27.777 --> 01:21:29.421
Yeah, she was.

01:21:29.546 --> 01:21:31.623
Any luck?

01:21:31.748 --> 01:21:32.848
No.

01:21:33.083 --> 01:21:34.726
You know, we're gonna be
the only freshmen

01:21:34.851 --> 01:21:38.129
who've never even kissed anybody.

01:21:38.254 --> 01:21:39.664
Oh, well.

01:21:39.789 --> 01:21:40.790
Yeah.

01:21:43.493 --> 01:21:46.860
So I guess you'll never know
which one of us liked you, huh?

01:21:53.770 --> 01:21:56.448
I guess not.

01:21:56.573 --> 01:21:58.097
I'm glad you came to see us.

01:21:59.776 --> 01:22:00.777
Me too.

01:22:04.881 --> 01:22:05.882
Bye.

01:22:06.616 --> 01:22:07.617
Bye.

01:23:37.473 --> 01:23:38.701
Breakfast?

01:23:59.729 --> 01:24:03.392
Anna wanted me to give you
her number.

01:24:05.034 --> 01:24:06.934
Thanks.

01:24:07.370 --> 01:24:10.715
Good luck figuring things out.

01:24:10.840 --> 01:24:12.740
Thanks.

01:24:14.210 --> 01:24:18.423
She wanted to know if you like her.

01:24:18.548 --> 01:24:21.759
She had the crush on me, right?

01:24:21.884 --> 01:24:23.384
Yeah.

01:24:24.254 --> 01:24:26.331
Well, tell her I like you both.

01:24:26.456 --> 01:24:27.616
And I'm sticking to it.

01:24:28.491 --> 01:24:29.868
Okay.

01:24:29.993 --> 01:24:32.470
I think you like me too.

01:24:32.595 --> 01:24:35.440
You'd just never admit it, right?

01:24:35.565 --> 01:24:37.089
I wouldn't admit it.

01:24:40.536 --> 01:24:41.646
Well, it was nice seeing you.

01:24:41.771 --> 01:24:42.772
Yeah.

01:24:52.949 --> 01:24:55.126
You're too good for Kerri Sullivan.

01:24:55.251 --> 01:24:56.275
Honestly.

01:24:57.754 --> 01:24:59.230
Thanks.

01:24:59.355 --> 01:25:02.133
Maybe I'll make it
to Chicago someday.

01:25:02.258 --> 01:25:04.002
What makes you think I'll be there?

01:25:04.127 --> 01:25:05.822
I'm pretty intuitive.

01:25:36.759 --> 01:25:38.603
You're gonna be so tired
in the morning.

01:25:38.728 --> 01:25:39.637
I know.

01:25:39.762 --> 01:25:42.512
I should get back before
everybody wakes up.

01:25:44.867 --> 01:25:47.017
Do you want to go down it once?

01:25:48.805 --> 01:25:50.515
I'm drunk.

01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:51.883
Me too.

01:25:52.008 --> 01:25:53.475
Come on.

01:26:24.273 --> 01:26:25.831
I want to kiss you.

01:26:31.514 --> 01:26:33.914
How about when we get to the bottom?

01:26:35.618 --> 01:26:37.017
Let's go.

01:26:56.272 --> 01:26:58.001
What are you doing?

01:26:59.442 --> 01:27:02.320
I don't know.

01:27:02.445 --> 01:27:04.345
I don't want to kiss you.

01:27:06.115 --> 01:27:07.116
Oh.

01:27:12.188 --> 01:27:15.851
I mean, I do, but not right now.

01:27:22.331 --> 01:27:24.959
I like you, and...

01:27:27.470 --> 01:27:30.439
It's not like everything
has to happen tonight.

01:27:33.142 --> 01:27:34.143
Okay.

01:27:42.051 --> 01:27:43.052
You go first.

01:28:12.215 --> 01:28:14.325
Did you find her?

01:28:14.450 --> 01:28:15.815
Yeah, I did.

01:28:19.055 --> 01:28:20.317
Did you see any meteors?

01:28:21.591 --> 01:28:22.990
It was too cloudy.

01:28:32.001 --> 01:28:34.492
Were you thinking about me
when I was gone?

01:28:36.572 --> 01:28:37.573
No.

01:28:43.913 --> 01:28:44.914
I was.

01:28:46.482 --> 01:28:47.992
I knew it.

01:28:48.117 --> 01:28:49.260
I could tell you knew.

01:28:49.385 --> 01:28:51.250
That's why I was telling you, stupid.
