MUCH MORE.

05:50.751 --> 05:53.020
SHE'S FALLEN IN LOVE
WITH YOU.

06:14.174 --> 06:15.776
THEN YOU'RE GOING
TO FREEZE THE FUDGE,

06:15.809 --> 06:17.911
THEN YOU'RE GOING
TO EXPLAIN TO HER

06:17.945 --> 06:20.080
AS GENTLY BUT FIRMLY
AS YOU CAN

06:20.113 --> 06:23.584
WHY IT CAN NEVER BE.

YOUR PANTS.

FIRST APPEAR?

FROM PULLING TOO HARD.

IT'S A CHANCRE.

A CASE OF SYPHILIS.

11:12.505 --> 11:15.108
- I ASKED YOU
TO NOT TURN ON THE LIGHT.

11:15.142 --> 11:16.710
[music stops]

11:16.744 --> 11:18.045
- HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO SEE YOU?

11:18.078 --> 11:19.847
- THAT'S THE POINT.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.314
- STILL PUFFY?
- [scoffs]

11:21.348 --> 11:23.917
PUFFY? YEAH, I'D BE THRILLED
WITH PUFFY.

11:23.951 --> 11:25.318
I'D REJOICE WITH SWOLLEN.

11:25.352 --> 11:27.855
COMPARED TO ME, THE ELEPHANT MAN
IS A SUPERMODEL.

11:27.888 --> 11:30.791
- ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE ALWAYS
CRANKY BEFORE YOU EAT.

11:30.824 --> 11:32.259
COME ON.
LET'S GO GRAB SOME DINNER.

11:32.292 --> 11:33.961
- WHAT, ME?

11:33.994 --> 11:37.798
GO OUT IN PUBLIC?
LIKE THIS?

11:37.831 --> 11:39.399
WHAT HAVE I DONE TO MYSELF?

11:39.432 --> 11:42.002
- YOU'VE HAD COSMETIC SURGERY.

11:42.035 --> 11:44.237
EVERYONE WHO'S HAD IT
GOES THROUGH THIS.

11:44.271 --> 11:47.207
BUT ONCE IT'S HEALED,
YOU'LL HAVE A FABULOUS NEW FACE.

11:47.240 --> 11:48.742
- I DON'T WANT
A FABULOUS NEW FACE.

11:48.776 --> 11:50.343
I WANT MY NOT-SO-FABULOUS
OLD FACE.

11:50.377 --> 11:51.945
- YOU DON'T MEAN THAT.

11:51.979 --> 11:54.081
- THIS IS THE WORST MISTAKE
I'VE EVER MADE.

11:54.114 --> 11:55.816
WHAT MAKES IT WORSER IS--

11:55.849 --> 11:57.017
IS THAT A WORD?

11:57.050 --> 11:59.953
- NO.

11:59.987 --> 12:01.822
- ALL I WANTED
WAS TO BE BEAUTIFUL.

12:01.855 --> 12:03.356
OR IF NOT BEAUTIFUL,
AT LEAST ALMOST BEAUTIFUL.

12:03.390 --> 12:06.259
IS THAT SO MUCH TO ASK?

12:06.293 --> 12:08.228
INSTEAD, I'M CONDEMNED

12:08.261 --> 12:12.299
TO SPEND THE REMAINDER
OF MY DAYS IN SHADOW...

12:12.332 --> 12:15.102
TRAVELLING
THROUGH THE SEWERS...

12:15.135 --> 12:18.238
LIKE THE PHANTOM
OF THE PITTSBURGH CIVIC OPERA.

12:18.271 --> 12:21.441
[dramatic opera music]

12:21.474 --> 12:23.977
[keys jingle]

12:24.011 --> 12:26.780
*

12:26.814 --> 12:29.182
- MORTGAGE.

12:29.216 --> 12:30.984
[keys tapping]

12:31.018 --> 12:32.052
PHONE BILL.

12:32.085 --> 12:34.454
- WHEW.
WHAT IS THIS $1,200?

12:34.487 --> 12:36.156
- OH, THE WATER HEATER
BROKE AGAIN,

12:36.189 --> 12:37.390
AND THE PLUMBER
SAID IT COULDN'T BE REPAIRED,

12:37.424 --> 12:38.859
SO I HAD TO HAVE IT
REPLACED.

12:38.892 --> 12:40.060
- DID YOU GET
OTHER ESTIMATES?

12:40.093 --> 12:42.195
- NO. THERE WASN'T TIME.

12:42.229 --> 12:43.530
HERE'S THE PREMIUM
FOR THE CAR INSURANCE.

12:43.563 --> 12:45.165
- WAIT--
WAIT A MINUTE.

12:45.198 --> 12:46.867
WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO PAY
FOR HALF THE WATER HEATER,

12:46.900 --> 12:49.036
CONSIDERING I NO LONGER
LIVE HERE OR TAKE BATHS HERE?

12:49.069 --> 12:50.470
- BUT YOUR CHILDREN DO,

12:50.503 --> 12:52.005
AND I PAY
FOR HALF OF YOUR APARTMENT

12:52.039 --> 12:53.340
AND I DON'T LIVE THERE.

12:53.373 --> 12:55.175
- I STILL DON'T THINK
IT'S FAIR.

12:55.208 --> 12:56.443
YOU DIDN'T EVEN CONSULT ME,
YET YOU EXPECT ME TO PAY.

12:56.476 --> 12:58.045
- OKAY.
TELL YOU WHAT.

12:58.078 --> 12:59.546
WHY DON'T I TAKE THEM
DOWN TO THE RIVER,

12:59.579 --> 13:01.181
WHERE I'LL WASH THEM,
AND WHILE I'M AT IT,

13:01.214 --> 13:02.883
I'LL BEAT THEIR CLOTHES
AGAINST THE ROCKS.

13:02.916 --> 13:04.952
- YOU ALWAYS
HAVE A SMART ANSWER.

13:04.985 --> 13:06.153
- WELL, THE STUPID ANSWER
WOULD BE,

13:06.186 --> 13:07.888
"FINE,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY."

13:07.921 --> 13:09.156
BUT YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO HEAR THAT FROM ME.

13:09.189 --> 13:10.590
- I'M STRETCHED
TO THE LIMIT AS IT IS.

13:10.623 --> 13:11.959
I'M SURE YOU CAN FIND
THE MONEY ELSEWHERE.

13:11.992 --> 13:13.426
- ANY BRIGHT IDEAS?

13:13.460 --> 13:16.563
- [scoffs]
GO BACK TO WORK.

13:16.596 --> 13:19.066
- GO BACK TO--
WHEN YOU HAD GUS,

13:19.099 --> 13:21.334
I MADE SURE THAT YOU
WERE AS COMFORTABLE AS POSSIBLE

13:21.368 --> 13:23.036
SO YOU COULD STAY HOME
WITH HIM.

13:23.070 --> 13:24.571
- THAT WAS A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES.

13:24.604 --> 13:25.939
- OH, HOW'S THAT?

13:25.973 --> 13:27.975
- WE WERE
STILL LIVING TOGETHER.

13:28.008 --> 13:31.511
AND WE STILL
LOVED EACH OTHER.

13:31.544 --> 13:34.214
I'LL PAY
FOR EVERYTHING ELSE...

13:34.247 --> 13:37.350
BUT NOT THE HEATER.

13:39.419 --> 13:40.888
- [scoffs]

13:48.295 --> 13:49.396
- MMM.

13:49.429 --> 13:51.865
- TASTE THIS.

13:56.503 --> 14:00.507
- THAT'S SUSPICIOUSLY GOOD.

14:00.540 --> 14:03.076
DID JULIA CHILD
LEAVE YOU HER COOKBOOK?

14:03.110 --> 14:05.212
- NO, MICHAEL
LENT ME ONE OF HIS.

14:05.245 --> 14:07.414
- THE LITTLE WIVES,
SWAPPING RECIPES.

14:07.447 --> 14:09.482
WHAT'S NEXT?
MATES?

14:09.516 --> 14:12.152
- I HAPPEN TO LIKE COOKING.

14:12.185 --> 14:14.888
IT MAKES ME FEEL GOOD
TO HAVE A HOME-COOKED MEAL.

14:14.922 --> 14:16.523
I EVEN THOUGHT, SILLY ME,

14:16.556 --> 14:18.992
THAT IT WOULD MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD
TO HAVE SOMEONE COOK FOR YOU.

14:19.026 --> 14:22.229
BUT IF A HOME-COOKED MEAL
IS SO UNAPPETIZING TO YOU,

14:22.262 --> 14:24.497
YOU ARE WELCOME
TO ORDER YOURSELF THAI FOOD

14:24.531 --> 14:26.099
FOR THE THIRD TIME
THIS WEEK.

14:26.133 --> 14:28.168
- I LOVE YOUR CREAM SAUCE.

14:28.201 --> 14:31.638
[slaps butt]

14:31.671 --> 14:36.276
- GUESS WHAT'S FOR DESSERT.

14:36.309 --> 14:39.646
- A PENICILLIN TART,
WITH SEASONAL BERRIES.

14:39.679 --> 14:41.982
- WHAT?

14:42.015 --> 14:44.284
- I SAID A PENICILLIN TART.

14:49.957 --> 14:53.460
- I HAVE SYPHILIS.

14:53.493 --> 14:55.462
- SYPHILIS?

14:55.495 --> 14:57.430
- IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

14:57.464 --> 15:00.067
- IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL?

15:00.100 --> 15:02.135
IT CAN CAUSE
HEART ABNORMALITIES,

15:02.169 --> 15:04.271
MENTAL DISORDERS,
BLINDNESS.

15:04.304 --> 15:06.273
- THANK YOU FOR
THE PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT,

15:06.306 --> 15:07.540
DR. TAYLOR,
BUT THE PATIENT'S

15:07.574 --> 15:12.145
ALREADY BEEN TREATED
AND CURED.

15:12.179 --> 15:14.481
ALL I HAVE TO DO NOW IS REFRAIN
FROM FUCKING YOUR BRAINS OUT

15:14.514 --> 15:16.216
FOR THE NEXT 48 HOURS.

15:16.249 --> 15:21.188
MAKE THAT 42.

15:21.221 --> 15:23.556
BY THE WAY,
YOU SHOULD GET YOURSELF TESTED.

15:23.590 --> 15:25.225
- DID YOU FUCK SOMEONE
WITHOUT A CONDOM?

15:25.258 --> 15:27.027
- NO.

15:27.060 --> 15:29.496
NEVER.
WORD OF HONOR.

15:29.529 --> 15:31.031
- THEN HOW'D YOU--

15:31.064 --> 15:33.967
- MUST HAVE BEEN SOMEONE
WHO SUCKED ME OFF.

15:34.001 --> 15:35.335
- [scoffs]

15:35.368 --> 15:36.703
I'M SURPRISED IT HASN'T
HAPPENED SOONER,

15:36.736 --> 15:38.305
CONSIDERING
WHERE YOUR DICK'S BEEN.

15:38.338 --> 15:39.606
- EXCUSE ME,
BUT YOU HAVEN'T EXACTLY

15:39.639 --> 15:42.075
BEEN A SAINT YOURSELF.

15:42.109 --> 15:43.610
IN FACT...

15:43.643 --> 15:46.613
I MIGHT HAVE EVEN
GOTTEN IT FROM YOU.

15:51.218 --> 15:54.121
WHEN'S DINNER?

15:57.357 --> 15:59.392
- YES, SHE ATE.

15:59.426 --> 16:02.595
NO, SHE'S NOT COLICKY.
YES.

16:02.629 --> 16:04.531
SHE'S SLEEPING
LIKE A BABY.

16:04.564 --> 16:06.133
- [chuckles]

16:06.166 --> 16:09.102
- LOOK, MEL,
I'VE GOT TO GO.

16:09.136 --> 16:11.004
YES, I PROMISE.

16:11.038 --> 16:14.341
IF THERE'S A PROBLEM,
I'LL CALL.

16:14.374 --> 16:16.209
CHRIST!
SHE CALLS EVERY FIVE MINUTES.

16:16.243 --> 16:18.545
- SHE'S A MOTHER.
- SHE'S A FUCKING CONTROL FREAK

16:18.578 --> 16:20.513
IS WHAT SHE IS.
- CAN I BE EXCUSED?

16:20.547 --> 16:22.115
- YOU DIDN'T EAT ANYTHING.
EAT.

16:22.149 --> 16:25.118
- NO CONTROL FREAKS HERE.

16:28.521 --> 16:30.223
ARE YOU OKAY?

16:30.257 --> 16:33.526
- AWESOME.

16:37.597 --> 16:39.666
- LOOK, YOUR PRINCIPAL
CALLED.

16:39.699 --> 16:42.035
- I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.
- WE KNOW.

16:42.069 --> 16:43.403
- HE WANTS US
TO COME TO A MEETING

16:43.436 --> 16:44.437
WITH SOME OF THE PARENTS.

16:44.471 --> 16:48.141
- ABOUT WHAT?

16:48.175 --> 16:50.143
- ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
AT THE SWIM MEET.

16:50.177 --> 16:52.512
- OH, FUCK!
- HEY, WH-WHOA, HOLD ON.

16:52.545 --> 16:54.514
- IT'S NOT NECESSARILY
A BAD THING.

16:54.547 --> 16:56.249
- AND HOW DO YOU
FIGURE THAT?

16:56.283 --> 16:58.585
- THERE'LL BE A HEALTH OFFICIAL
TO ANSWER QUESTIONS,

16:58.618 --> 17:01.454
PUT THEIR MINDS AT EASE,
AND HOPEFULLY,

17:01.488 --> 17:03.256
PUT AN END TO WHAT YOU'VE
BEEN GOING THROUGH.

17:03.290 --> 17:08.027
- LIKE ANYONE GIVES A SHIT
WHAT I'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH.

17:11.164 --> 17:12.332
I'M COMING TOO.

17:12.365 --> 17:15.168
- [sighs]
IT'S FOR PARENTS.

17:15.202 --> 17:18.071
- IT'S ABOUT ME, ISN'T IT?

17:18.105 --> 17:21.708
SO I HAVE A RIGHT
TO BE THERE.

17:24.711 --> 17:27.180
[dance music]

17:27.214 --> 17:29.449
- CHEERS!

17:29.482 --> 17:31.284
*

17:31.318 --> 17:33.686
- HI!
- NICE TO SEE YOU.

17:33.720 --> 17:39.159
*

17:39.192 --> 17:40.827
- THIS IS A DYKE BAR.

17:40.860 --> 17:42.562
WHY DID YOU BRING ME
TO A DYKE BAR?

17:42.595 --> 17:44.831
- THINK OF IT
AS YOUR OUT-OF-TOWN TRYOUT.

17:44.864 --> 17:46.199
YOU'RE CERTAINLY
NOT GOING TO FUCK ANYBODY

17:46.233 --> 17:47.634
IN HERE, ALL RIGHT?
- [scoffs]

17:47.667 --> 17:49.836
- SO IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE,

17:49.869 --> 17:53.106
OR WHAT ANYBODY THINKS.

17:53.140 --> 17:54.574
- HEY, YOU'RE RIGHT.

17:54.607 --> 17:56.176
NO ONE HERE KNOWS ME,
SO I'M SAFE.

17:56.209 --> 17:57.310
I'M ANONYMOUS.
- YEAH.

17:57.344 --> 17:59.446
- TEDDY!

17:59.479 --> 18:01.314
HEY, EM.

18:01.348 --> 18:02.315
- MOTHER OF CHRIST.

18:02.349 --> 18:04.451
- NO, HONEY,
JUST OF MICHAEL.

18:04.484 --> 18:06.253
WHAT ARE YOU BOYS
DOING HERE?

18:06.286 --> 18:08.221
DON'T TELL ME YOU'VE DEVELOPED
A TASTE FOR SNATCH?

18:08.255 --> 18:09.889
- I COULD ASK YOU
THE SAME THING.

18:09.922 --> 18:13.126
- I'M TAKING
YOUR SUGGESTION.

18:15.228 --> 18:17.730
- OHH!

18:17.764 --> 18:20.700
HOPE THE FISH BITE.

18:23.370 --> 18:27.274
- YOU LOOK PRETTY BEAT UP,
BABE.

18:28.508 --> 18:30.510
DID A MAN DO THAT TO YOU?

18:30.543 --> 18:34.614
- HUH?

18:34.647 --> 18:36.349
- TOO BAD I WASN'T AROUND
TO PROTECT YOU.

18:36.383 --> 18:38.218
BUT DON'T YOU WORRY,
KITTEN.

18:38.251 --> 18:40.620
THAT SWELLING'S
GOING TO GO DOWN,

18:40.653 --> 18:42.622
AND WHEN IT DOES,

18:42.655 --> 18:45.892
YOU'RE GOING TO BE
JUST AS PRETTY AS EVER.

18:45.925 --> 18:48.127
[slaps butt]

18:53.866 --> 18:57.237
- THAT...PERSON...

18:57.270 --> 18:59.372
THINKS I'M A LESBIAN.

18:59.406 --> 19:01.574
MY GOD.

19:01.608 --> 19:05.678
WHAT HAVE I DONE TO MYSELF?

19:05.712 --> 19:07.180
I'M GOING HOME.

19:07.214 --> 19:10.750
AND I'M NEVER
COMING BACK OUT!

19:13.886 --> 19:18.725
- SHE JUST HASN'T BEEN HERSELF
SINCE THE HOT FLASHES.

19:22.829 --> 19:24.831
- LOT OF GREAT-LOOKING GALS
HERE, WOULDN'T YOU SAY?

19:24.864 --> 19:27.434
- I SUPPOSE.

19:27.467 --> 19:30.937
I'M REALLY GLAD
YOU ASKED ME OUT, DEB.

19:30.970 --> 19:32.805
- LOOK AT HER.

19:32.839 --> 19:35.708
HUH? SHE'S...HANDSOME.

19:35.742 --> 19:37.944
ALL THOSE TATTOOS.

19:37.977 --> 19:41.281
- I WAS HOPING WE COULD
SPEND SOME TIME TOGETHER,

19:41.314 --> 19:44.484
JUST THE TWO OF US.

19:44.517 --> 19:47.587
- WHAT ABOUT HER,
STANDING THERE ALL BY HERSELF?

19:47.620 --> 19:50.723
I BET SHE'D LOVE IT IF SOMEONE
TOOK HER HAND AND SAID,

19:50.757 --> 19:52.559
"BUY YOU A BEER?"

19:52.592 --> 19:56.696
- YEAH, I HOPE SOMEONE DOES.

19:56.729 --> 19:59.299
- LORETTA, HONEY, ISN'T
THERE SOMEONE IN THIS PLACE

19:59.332 --> 20:02.469
THAT TICKLES YOUR...
FANCY?

20:02.502 --> 20:05.805
- THERE IS.

20:08.007 --> 20:11.978
BUY YOU A BEER?

20:12.011 --> 20:16.549
*

20:19.051 --> 20:21.854
- YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT ONE
OF THE BENEFITS OF MARRIAGE,

20:21.888 --> 20:24.257
BESIDES GETTING TO HAVE SEX
WITH THE SAME PERSON

20:24.291 --> 20:25.592
FOR THE REST
OF YOUR NATURAL-BORN LIFE...

20:25.625 --> 20:26.759
- [laughs]

20:26.793 --> 20:28.795
- WAS BEING ABLE
TO LET YOURSELF GO.

20:28.828 --> 20:30.597
- I'M SURE
YOU'LL BE PLEASED TO KNOW

20:30.630 --> 20:33.266
MICHAEL AND I STILL ENJOY
LOOKING GOOD FOR EACH OTHER.

20:33.300 --> 20:35.402
- YOU STILL LOOK?

20:35.435 --> 20:37.404
- NOT EVERYONE REGARDS
MARRIAGE AND MONOGAMY

20:37.437 --> 20:39.506
AS A DEATH SENTENCE.

20:39.539 --> 20:42.775
FOR SOME OF US, THEY'RE
SIMPLY A PART OF GROWING UP.

20:42.809 --> 20:45.412
- YOU MEAN, GIVING UP.

20:45.445 --> 20:47.614
SURRENDERING TO THE STRAIGHT
WORLD'S CONCEPTION

20:47.647 --> 20:49.749
OF WHAT IT MEANS
TO BE A MAN.

20:49.782 --> 20:53.386
- YOU CAN'T BE PETER PAN
FOREVER.

20:53.420 --> 20:56.789
- YOU CAN TRY.

20:56.823 --> 20:59.892
- THESE DAYS, I PREFER
SPENDING TIME IN A FAMILY ROOM,

20:59.926 --> 21:01.394
RATHER THAN A BACK ROOM.

21:01.428 --> 21:03.496
- AS OPPOSED TO "THOSE DAYS,"

21:03.530 --> 21:05.798
WHEN YOU PREFERRED
GETTING GANG-BANGED

21:05.832 --> 21:07.900
IN THE ORGY ROOM
OF THE LIBERTY BATHS?

21:07.934 --> 21:09.502
- LEAVE IT TO YOU
TO REMEMBER.

21:09.536 --> 21:10.770
- AND LEAVE IT TO YOU
TO FORGET,

21:10.803 --> 21:16.676
NOW THAT YOU'RE HIV
AND OH-SO P.C.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.812
- THERE YOU GO.

21:19.846 --> 21:23.049
GOT IT?

21:23.082 --> 21:24.551
- WELL, I MAY NOT
HAVE STOPPED MICHAEL

21:24.584 --> 21:27.654
FROM BECOMING ONE
OF THE STEPFORD FAGS,

21:27.687 --> 21:29.389
BUT AT LEAST
I SAVED JUSTIN

21:29.422 --> 21:31.591
FROM A FATE WORSE
THAN BEING A HETEROSEXUAL.

21:31.624 --> 21:33.826
- AND WHAT'S THAT?

21:37.029 --> 21:40.767
- AN IMITATION HETEROSEXUAL.

21:42.369 --> 21:44.003
- AREN'T YOU
GOING AFTER YOUR PREY?

21:44.036 --> 21:45.705
- I'D LOVE TO, PROFESSOR,

21:45.738 --> 21:48.074
BUT I'VE STILL GOT
ANOTHER 24 HOURS

21:48.107 --> 21:51.310
UNTIL THE SYPHILIS
CLEARS UP.

21:56.583 --> 21:58.718
- NOW, I'M SURE WE'LL BE BACK
BEFORE SHE WAKES UP.

21:58.751 --> 22:00.820
- YEAH, SO JUST, UH,
KEEP THE MONITOR WITH YOU

22:00.853 --> 22:03.456
AND, UH, MAKE YOURSELVES
AT HOME.

22:03.490 --> 22:04.857
- THANKS.

22:04.891 --> 22:06.959
- YOU HAVE
MY CELL PHONE NUMBER.

22:06.993 --> 22:08.495
JUST IN CASE.
- DON'T WORRY.

22:08.528 --> 22:11.431
- ALL RIGHT,
HAVE FUN, YOU TWO.

22:11.464 --> 22:14.801
- THANKS AGAIN.

22:18.538 --> 22:20.840
- OH, MY GOD.
[laughs]

22:20.873 --> 22:22.509
SHE'S SO CUTE.

22:22.542 --> 22:24.577
- SHE'S PRACTICALLY
TWICE AS BIG ALREADY.

22:24.611 --> 22:27.714
- EVER THINK
ABOUT HAVING ONE?

22:27.747 --> 22:30.049
- SOMETIMES.

22:30.082 --> 22:31.884
- SO WHAT'S STOPPING YOU?

22:31.918 --> 22:34.987
- I'M SORRY, DID I FORGET
TO MENTION WHO I LIVE WITH?

22:35.021 --> 22:38.991
- DID YOU EVER ASK HIM?
- HE WON'T EVEN GET A PUPPY.

22:39.025 --> 22:43.463
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MUCH
ITALIA MODA FURNITURE COSTS?

22:43.496 --> 22:45.665
ANYWAY, NOW IS NOT THE TIME

22:45.698 --> 22:48.801
TO HAVE A LIFE-ALTERING
DISCUSSION WITH HIM.

22:51.504 --> 22:54.774
AT LEAST UNTIL
HIS SYPHILIS CLEARS UP.

22:54.807 --> 22:57.076
- I KNOW LAST WEEK'S
INCIDENT AT THE SWIM MEET

22:57.109 --> 22:58.745
RAISED A LOT OF CONCERN
REGARDING YOUR CHILDREN'S

22:58.778 --> 23:00.413
HEALTH AND SAFETY.

23:00.447 --> 23:02.482
THAT'S WHY I'VE INVITED
DR. JUDITH DAVIDSON

23:02.515 --> 23:03.616
FROM THE PITTSBURGH
AIDS PROJECT

23:03.650 --> 23:04.784
TO SPEAK WITH US
THIS EVENING

23:04.817 --> 23:07.754
AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS
YOU MIGHT HAVE.

23:07.787 --> 23:12.191
- DR. DAVIDSON.
- THANK YOU, MR. EVERETT.

23:12.224 --> 23:14.160
UNFORTUNATELY,
THERE'S STILL A GREAT DEAL

23:14.193 --> 23:17.530
OF UNCERTAINTY
AND APPREHENSION ABOUT HIV,

23:17.564 --> 23:19.532
SO I WELCOME
THE OPPORTUNITY

23:19.566 --> 23:21.200
TO NOT ONLY
INFORM YOU OF THE FACTS,

23:21.233 --> 23:24.637
BUT TO HOPEFULLY
ALLEVIATE SOME OF YOUR FEARS.

23:24.671 --> 23:27.507
FIRST OFF,
LET ME ASSURE YOU

23:27.540 --> 23:30.777
THAT THE RISK
OF HIV TRANSMISSION

23:30.810 --> 23:32.579
FROM HUNTER'S INJURY
IN THE POOL

23:32.612 --> 23:34.981
IS NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE.

23:35.014 --> 23:38.985
IN FACT, IT WOULD REQUIRE
DIRECT BLOOD-TO-BLOOD CONTACT

23:39.018 --> 23:41.554
FOR THERE TO BE ANY SIGNIFICANT
DEGREE OF EXPOSURE.

23:41.588 --> 23:43.590
- THAT'S COMFORTING
TO HEAR, DOCTOR,

23:43.623 --> 23:46.926
BUT THAT'S NOT THE ONLY THING
HE'S EXPOSING OUR CHILDREN TO.

23:46.959 --> 23:49.596
THE KID IS A HUSTLER.
A MALE PROSTITUTE.

23:49.629 --> 23:51.698
- HOLD ON!
- DO YOU MIND IF I FINISH?

23:51.731 --> 23:53.199
- AS A MATTER OF FACT,
WE DO.

23:53.232 --> 23:55.201
- I'M SURE THAT I SPEAK
FOR EVERYONE HERE

23:55.234 --> 23:56.736
WHEN I SAY
WE DON'T WANT OUR KIDS

23:56.769 --> 23:58.671
AROUND SOMEONE
WITH HIS BACKGROUND.

23:58.705 --> 24:00.740
- WELL, YOU DON'T KNOW A DAMN
THING ABOUT HIS BACKGROUND.

24:00.773 --> 24:02.742
HOW HE WAS ABUSED
BY HIS MOTHER,

24:02.775 --> 24:04.544
HOW HE HAD TO ESCAPE
FROM A SERIES OF FOSTER HOMES,

24:04.577 --> 24:06.012
LITERALLY
SLEEP IN THE STREETS.

24:06.045 --> 24:07.480
- OR HOW HE HAD
TO REGAIN HIS HEALTH

24:07.514 --> 24:08.615
TO CATCH UP IN SCHOOL.

24:08.648 --> 24:09.682
- HEY, WHAT IS THIS,
THE PLOT

24:09.716 --> 24:11.217
TO A CHARLES DICKENS NOVEL?

24:11.250 --> 24:12.752
[laughter]

24:15.287 --> 24:18.691
- Y-YOUR CHILDREN
LEAD PRIVILEGED LIVES,

24:18.725 --> 24:22.595
AND YOU DARE TO LAUGH
AT MY SON'S MISFORTUNE.

24:24.764 --> 24:27.600
- IT'S OKAY, BEN.

24:27.634 --> 24:29.101
I'M GLAD
I CAME HERE TONIGHT,

24:29.135 --> 24:31.704
BECAUSE I LEARNED
SOMETHING TOO.

24:31.738 --> 24:35.842
NOW I KNOW HOW YOUR KIDS
GOT TO BE THE WAY THEY ARE.

24:35.875 --> 24:38.545
FROM YOU.

24:50.690 --> 24:53.025
- I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU CAN BE
SO CASUAL ABOUT IT.

24:53.059 --> 24:54.761
I'D FREAK OUT.

24:54.794 --> 24:56.896
- I DID AT FIRST, BUT...

24:56.929 --> 24:59.799
MY TEST CAME BACK NEGATIVE,
SO I GUESS EVERYTHING'S OKAY.

24:59.832 --> 25:01.868
- NEXT TIME,
YOU MIGHT NOT BE SO LUCKY.

25:01.901 --> 25:03.770
- I PROMISE
THAT I'LL BE SAFE.

25:03.803 --> 25:06.038
- I WISH YOU COULD
BE MORE THAN SAFE.

25:06.072 --> 25:08.040
I WISH YOU TWO WOULD...

25:08.074 --> 25:09.909
- SETTLE DOWN?

25:09.942 --> 25:12.679
GET MARRIED?
BE MONOGAMOUS?

25:12.712 --> 25:14.013
IT'S NEVER
GOING TO HAPPEN, DAPH.

25:14.046 --> 25:20.019
[baby crying]

25:20.052 --> 25:21.788
- OH. OH, OKAY.

25:21.821 --> 25:22.922
OH, MY GOD,
SHE'S BURNING UP.

25:22.955 --> 25:25.625
- WHAT? OH!

25:25.658 --> 25:27.326
I BETTER CALL MICHAEL.

25:27.359 --> 25:28.928
- OKAY, IT'S OKAY.

25:28.961 --> 25:30.763
IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY, SWEETHEART.

25:30.797 --> 25:34.333
[baby wailing]
IT'S OKAY.

25:34.366 --> 25:37.937
- FUCK, IT WENT STRAIGHT
TO VOICEMAIL.

25:37.970 --> 25:40.973
- UM...

25:42.675 --> 25:45.077
SHH.

25:46.212 --> 25:47.780
AWW.
[phone beeps]

25:47.814 --> 25:50.650
- [sighs]

25:50.683 --> 25:55.655
[mixed chatter]

25:55.688 --> 25:57.690
- [sighs]

25:57.724 --> 25:58.958
THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
AN INFORMATIVE MEETING,

25:58.991 --> 26:00.660
NOT A KANGAROO COURT.

26:00.693 --> 26:02.194
PLEASE ACCEPT MY APOLOGIES

26:02.228 --> 26:03.796
AND KNOW THAT NOT EVERYONE
FEELS THAT WAY.

26:03.830 --> 26:05.264
- OH, IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT,
MR. EVERETT,

26:05.297 --> 26:07.333
BUT THANKS FOR SAYING THAT.

26:07.366 --> 26:09.235
- HOWEVER, WE OBVIOUSLY
HAVE A MUCH BIGGER PROBLEM

26:09.268 --> 26:11.804
THAN I THOUGHT.

26:11.838 --> 26:13.740
IN LIGHT OF TONIGHT'S
REACTION,

26:13.773 --> 26:15.675
AND KNOWING THE OSTRACISM
YOU'VE HAD TO ENDURE,

26:15.708 --> 26:16.809
YOU MIGHT WANT
TO CONSIDER SENDING HUNTER

26:16.843 --> 26:17.810
TO ANOTHER SCHOOL.

26:17.844 --> 26:19.078
- I'M NOT LEAVING.

26:19.111 --> 26:20.847
- WE SHOULD AT LEAST CONSIDER

26:20.880 --> 26:22.248
WHAT MR. EVERETT
HAS TO SAY.

26:22.281 --> 26:24.851
- THEY CAN CALL ME
WHATEVER THEY WANT,

26:24.884 --> 26:26.619
NOT SIT NEAR ME.

26:26.653 --> 26:28.220
I DON'T CARE.

26:28.254 --> 26:32.591
THEY ARE NOT
GOING TO CHASE ME AWAY.

26:37.029 --> 26:40.967
[baby crying]

26:41.000 --> 26:42.234
- I GOT HERE
AS SOON AS I COULD.

26:42.268 --> 26:43.402
- WHERE'S GUS?

26:43.435 --> 26:44.971
- THANK GOD, DUSTY
COULD TAKE HIM.

26:45.004 --> 26:47.707
HOW IS SHE?
- OH, EARACHE WITH A FEVER.

26:47.740 --> 26:49.408
- MY POOR SWEETHEART.

26:49.441 --> 26:51.010
HAVE YOU BEEN WAITING LONG?

26:51.043 --> 26:52.645
- AN HOUR, AT LEAST.
IT'S INCREDIBLE.

26:52.679 --> 26:54.380
THEY SEE YOU SITTING HERE
WITH A SCREAMING INFANT,

26:54.413 --> 26:55.381
AND YOU THINK THEY'D
HAVE THE DECENCY--

26:55.414 --> 26:56.415
- WE JUST GOT THE MESSAGE.

26:56.448 --> 26:57.850
- YEAH, WHERE? IN BABYLON?

26:57.884 --> 26:59.652
- FUCK YOU.
- HEY, HEY. EASY, EASY.

26:59.686 --> 27:00.987
WE WERE AT HUNTER'S SCHOOL.
THERE WAS A PROBLEM.

27:01.020 --> 27:02.254
- YEAH, I'LL SAY
THERE'S A PROBLEM.

27:02.288 --> 27:03.856
- SHE'S BEEN WAITING
OVER AN HOUR.

27:03.890 --> 27:05.124
THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMEONE
TO TALK TO.

27:05.157 --> 27:06.392
- HOW COULD YOU LEAVE HER
LIKE THAT?

27:06.425 --> 27:07.393
AFTER ALL THE CRAP
YOU PUT US THROUGH.

27:07.426 --> 27:08.795
IT'S UNFORGIVABLE.

27:08.828 --> 27:10.062
- SHE WAS WITH
JUSTIN AND DAPHNE.

27:10.096 --> 27:11.063
- YEAH, WHAT THE HELL
DO THEY KNOW?

27:11.097 --> 27:12.398
- UH, ENOUGH TO CALL YOU.

27:12.431 --> 27:14.000
- YOU HAVE NO SAY IN THIS,
SO BUTT OUT.

27:14.033 --> 27:15.434
- EXCUSE ME?
- DON'T TALK TO HIM LIKE THAT.

27:15.467 --> 27:17.169
WE HAVE ANOTHER KID
WHO NEEDED OUR ATTENTION.

27:17.203 --> 27:18.404
- YEAH, I DON'T CARE
ABOUT YOUR OTHER KID RIGHT NOW.

27:18.437 --> 27:19.872
I CARE ABOUT THIS ONE,
MY DAUGHTER,

27:19.906 --> 27:21.140
WHO HAPPENS TO BE
IN A LOT OF PAIN.

27:21.173 --> 27:22.909
- I'M GOING TO FIND A NURSE.

27:22.942 --> 27:24.777
- ALL I KNOW IS THAT THE MINUTE
YOU HAVE HER, YOU TAKE OFF.

27:24.811 --> 27:26.178
WELL, WAIT TILL MY LAWYER
HEARS ABOUT THIS,

27:26.212 --> 27:28.180
BECAUSE THIS TIME,
THERE WILL BE NO SETTLING.

27:28.214 --> 27:29.749
WE'RE GOING TO GO TO COURT,

27:29.782 --> 27:30.917
AND I WILL MAKE SURE
THAT YOU LOSE CUSTODY.

27:30.950 --> 27:32.151
- YOU JUST TRY IT!

27:32.184 --> 27:33.285
- THE DOCTOR
WILL SEE YOUR BABY NOW.

27:33.319 --> 27:34.887
- IT'S ABOUT FUCKING TIME.

27:34.921 --> 27:36.055
- I'M SORRY,
BUT ONLY ONE OF YOU CAN GO.

27:36.088 --> 27:37.456
- OH. I'M GOING.
I'M HER MOTHER.

27:37.489 --> 27:38.758
- I'M GOING.
I'M HER FATHER.

27:38.791 --> 27:39.892
- YEAH, SOME FATHER.

27:39.926 --> 27:41.093
- YOU SAY THAT
ONE MORE TIME--

27:41.127 --> 27:42.094
- I'M GOING.

27:42.128 --> 27:43.295
YOU TWO CAN DUKE IT OUT,

27:43.329 --> 27:44.697
START WORLD WAR III
FOR ALL I CARE.

27:44.731 --> 27:48.200
MEANWHILE, OUR DAUGHTER
NEEDS ATTENTION.

27:53.372 --> 27:55.107
- * IT'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT

27:55.141 --> 27:57.043
* IT'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT

27:57.076 --> 27:59.946
* IT'S GONNA
BE ALL RIGHT NOW, BABY *

27:59.979 --> 28:01.814
- FLYING SOLO?

28:01.848 --> 28:03.049
- NOT EVERYONE'S
AS LUCKY AS YOU,

28:03.082 --> 28:07.186
TO BE IN A NON-RELATIONSHIP.

28:07.219 --> 28:10.056
- WHERE'S PITTSBURGH'S
VERY OWN EXTREME MAKEOVER?

28:10.089 --> 28:12.324
- OH, I TRIED TO CONVINCE HIM
TO MAKE AN APPEARANCE TONIGHT,

28:12.358 --> 28:14.193
BUT DISASTER STRUCK.

28:14.226 --> 28:16.328
HE SAW A LESBIAN
AND WENT BACK INTO HIS HOLE

28:16.362 --> 28:17.363
FOR ANOTHER SIX WEEKS.

28:17.396 --> 28:18.497
- [laughs]

28:18.530 --> 28:20.366
WELL, YOU CAN TELL THEODORE,

28:20.399 --> 28:23.269
UNLESS HE GETS HIS HOLE
BACK TO WORK MONDAY,

28:23.302 --> 28:26.072
HE'S FIRED.

28:26.105 --> 28:28.107
- I'LL BE SURE
TO GIVE HIM THE MESSAGE.

28:28.140 --> 28:30.810
- [sighs]
NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

28:30.843 --> 28:33.813
I HAVE ANOTHER
URGENT MESSAGE TO IMPART.

28:33.846 --> 28:38.484
- HALF-PRICE ADMISSION
FOR ALL BOTTOMS?

28:38.517 --> 28:42.354
- I HAVE SYPHILIS.

28:42.388 --> 28:46.358
- YOU HAVE--
- NEED I REPEAT?

28:46.392 --> 28:48.861
- WELL, THIS CERTAINLY
HASN'T BEEN YOUR YEAR,

28:48.895 --> 28:51.831
DICK-WISE.

28:51.864 --> 28:54.000
- IT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY
TO INFORM

28:54.033 --> 28:55.501
ALL OF MY FORMER RECEPTACLES

28:55.534 --> 28:57.837
SO THAT THEY
CAN GET TESTED.

28:57.870 --> 29:01.240
- WOULDN'T A FULL-PAGE AD
IN USA TODA BE MORE EFFICIENT?

29:01.273 --> 29:03.309
- I'VE ALWAYS PREFERRED
THE PERSONAL TOUCH.

29:03.342 --> 29:05.011
- IF YOU'D LAID OFF
THE PERSONAL TOUCH,

29:05.044 --> 29:09.015
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
TO START SPREADING THE NEWS.

29:12.484 --> 29:16.322
- HEY.
REMEMBER LAST WEDNESDAY?

29:16.355 --> 29:20.392
I HAVE SYPHILIS.

29:20.426 --> 29:21.994
- YOU REMEMBER LAST TUESDAY?
- YEAH.

29:22.028 --> 29:23.796
- YOU MIGHT WANT TO GET TESTED
FOR SYPHILIS.

29:23.830 --> 29:25.564
- FUCK. HEY, DO YOU REMEMBER
LAST WEEK IN THE BACK ROOM?

29:25.597 --> 29:26.933
- YEAH?
- WELL, WE MAY

29:26.966 --> 29:28.434
HAVE BEEN EXPOSED
TO SYPHILIS.

29:28.467 --> 29:29.535
- WELL, YOU MIGHT WANT
TO GET TESTED FOR SYPHILIS.

29:29.568 --> 29:31.003
- FUCK, NO!
WHAT?

29:31.037 --> 29:32.404
- HEY, DUDE,
YOU REMEMBER LAST TUESDAY?

29:32.438 --> 29:38.377
[mixed chatter]

29:44.483 --> 29:49.355
- FORTUNATELY FOR ME, I'VE BEEN
SPARED THAT NASTY RASH.

29:49.388 --> 29:52.324
- DUDE, REMEMBER, UH,
THAT LITTLE GET-TOGETHER WE HAD?

29:52.358 --> 29:53.960
- I THINK I GOT SYPHILIS.

29:53.993 --> 29:55.962
- I GOT SYPH.
- SYPH?

29:55.995 --> 29:57.096
- UNTIL NOW.

29:57.129 --> 30:01.033
[mixed chatter]

30:01.067 --> 30:02.368
[sighs]

30:10.943 --> 30:12.478
- OH, HOW IS SHE?

30:12.511 --> 30:14.313
- IS SHE OKAY?
- SHE'LL BE FINE.

30:14.346 --> 30:15.915
THEY GAVE HER
SOME BABY TYLENOL,

30:15.948 --> 30:17.183
WHICH NEEDS TO BE REPEATED
EVERY FOUR HOURS.

30:17.216 --> 30:18.584
- EVERY FOUR HOURS.

30:18.617 --> 30:20.052
- AND THEY PRESCRIBED
AMOXICILLIN TWICE A DAY.

30:20.086 --> 30:21.954
- WE'LL PICK THAT UP
AT THE PHARMACY.

30:21.988 --> 30:25.257
- OKAY, SWEETIE,
I'LL TAKE YOU HOME.

30:25.291 --> 30:27.126
- I WAS JUST ABOUT TO SAY
THE SAME THING.

30:27.159 --> 30:29.061
- WHY WOULD SHE GO WITH YOU?

30:29.095 --> 30:30.196
- BECAUSE IT'S STILL MY TIME.

30:30.229 --> 30:31.530
- I SAY YOU'VE
HAD ENOUGH TIME.

30:31.563 --> 30:32.965
- WE HAVE AN AGREEMENT.

30:32.999 --> 30:34.500
- AFTER YOU PRACTICALLY
ABANDONED HER?

30:34.533 --> 30:36.969
- WOULD YOU PLEASE CALM DOWN?
- I AGREE.

30:37.003 --> 30:38.971
- A SICK BABY NEEDS
TO BE WITH HER MOTHER.

30:39.005 --> 30:40.940
- I AM JUST AS CAPABLE
OF TAKING CARE OF HER AS YOU.

30:40.973 --> 30:43.075
- YOU'VE PROVEN THAT.

30:43.109 --> 30:45.077
- COME WITH DADDY, HONEYBUN.
- SHE'S COMING WITH ME.

30:45.111 --> 30:47.846
- WOULD YOU TWO STOP?

30:49.982 --> 30:51.350
- I DON'T THINK
EITHER ONE OF YOU

30:51.383 --> 30:53.085
GIVES A DAMN ABOUT
YOUR DAUGHTER'S WELFARE.

30:53.119 --> 30:54.887
ALL YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT
IS WHO HAS OWNERSHIP.

30:54.921 --> 30:56.956
- THAT IS NOT TRUE.
- HOW COULD YOU SAY THAT?

30:56.989 --> 31:00.092
- AND I'VE BEEN A PART OF IT.

31:00.126 --> 31:02.228
WELL, NO MORE.

31:02.261 --> 31:04.964
I'M WITHDRAWING FROM
THIS CUSTODIAL CIRCUS RIGHT NOW.

31:04.997 --> 31:07.033
JENNY REBECCA IS ALL YOURS.

31:07.066 --> 31:09.401
I JUST HOPE
YOU SPEND AS MUCH TIME

31:09.435 --> 31:13.872
THINKING ABOUT HER NEEDS
AS YOU DO ABOUT YOURS.

31:15.407 --> 31:18.444
- MR. MATTHEWS,
THE DOCTOR WILL SEE YOU NOW.

31:20.712 --> 31:26.885
[mixed chatter]

31:27.719 --> 31:31.423
- HEARTS.

31:31.457 --> 31:34.393
- AND MADE OUT
OF CHERRY JELL-O.

31:34.426 --> 31:36.395
- AND FLOWERS.
THEY'RE EDIBLE PANSIES.

31:36.428 --> 31:39.665
- NOT THE FIRST ONES IN HERE.
[laughs]

31:39.698 --> 31:42.168
WELL, Y-YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE GONE TO SO MUCH TROUBLE.

31:42.201 --> 31:45.304
- NOTHING'S TOO MUCH TROUBLE
FOR YOU, DEB.

31:45.337 --> 31:47.206
HEY, YOU WANT TO GO BACK
TO THAT BAR TONIGHT?

31:47.239 --> 31:49.675
I'M OFF AT 6:00.

31:49.708 --> 31:53.445
- IT'S NOT REALLY MY SCENE,
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

31:53.479 --> 31:55.547
- YEAH,
TOO CROWDED AND NOISY.

31:55.581 --> 31:57.483
I UNDERSTAND.

31:57.516 --> 32:00.352
HOW ABOUT WE GO TO A NICE,
QUIET PLACE AND WE CAN--

32:00.386 --> 32:02.488
- LORETTA...

32:02.521 --> 32:03.722
SIT.
[bell dings]

32:03.755 --> 32:05.057
- I'D LOVE TO,
BUT I GOT A COUPLE

32:05.091 --> 32:06.225
OF PINK PLATES COMING UP.

32:06.258 --> 32:08.227
- BETTY CAN SERVE THEM NOW.

32:08.260 --> 32:09.728
PLEASE SIT.
[bell dings]

32:09.761 --> 32:13.332
- YOUR ORDER'S UP.

32:16.468 --> 32:18.604
- LORETTA...

32:18.637 --> 32:20.973
I AM TRULY FLATTERED...

32:21.007 --> 32:23.175
AND HONORED...

32:23.209 --> 32:26.345
THAT YOU LIKE ME.

32:26.378 --> 32:29.615
- I MORE THAN LIKE YOU.

32:29.648 --> 32:33.052
- I KNOW.

32:33.085 --> 32:36.588
IT'S JUST THAT
THERE'S ONE LITTLE HITCH.

32:36.622 --> 32:38.624
I'M NOT GAY.

32:38.657 --> 32:41.093
ALTHOUGH, GOD KNOWS...
[laughs]

32:41.127 --> 32:43.629
COULD HAVE SPARED MYSELF
A LOT OF GRIEF IF I WAS.

32:43.662 --> 32:45.664
BUT, UH,
LET'S FACE IT, HONEY,

32:45.697 --> 32:47.333
AFTER HANGING OUT
HERE ALL THESE YEARS,

32:47.366 --> 32:48.600
IF IT STILL
HASN'T RUBBED OFF,

32:48.634 --> 32:51.237
I THINK WE CAN
SAFELY ASSUME THAT, UM,

32:51.270 --> 32:55.141
IT'S NOT GONNA.

32:55.174 --> 32:59.145
- I DIDN'T THINK
I WAS GAY AT FIRST EITHER.

32:59.178 --> 33:03.149
BUT THAT'S BECAUSE
I HADN'T MET THE RIGHT PERSON.

33:05.717 --> 33:10.122
- I HAVE MET
THE RIGHT PERSON.

33:10.156 --> 33:14.193
HIS NAME IS CARL HORVATH.

33:24.603 --> 33:25.771
- WELL, I'VE GOT
TO GO PICK UP THOSE ORDERS.

33:25.804 --> 33:28.407
- NO, LISTEN.
PLEASE.

33:28.440 --> 33:30.142
LISTEN.

33:30.176 --> 33:32.111
YOU DON'T REALLY LOVE ME.

33:32.144 --> 33:35.247
- WHY WOULDN'T I?

33:35.281 --> 33:38.517
YOU'RE WONDERFUL.

33:38.550 --> 33:42.254
- WELL, I'LL TAKE
THE COMPLIMENT.

33:42.288 --> 33:45.291
BUT YOU JUST THINK YOU DO.

33:45.324 --> 33:47.259
BECAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN YOUR LIFE,

33:47.293 --> 33:50.796
YOU'RE FINALLY EXPRESSING
THE REAL YOU.

33:50.829 --> 33:53.465
AND I AM THRILLED FOR YOU.

33:53.499 --> 33:55.667
TRULY, I AM.

33:55.701 --> 33:58.570
BUT YOU NEED TO LOVE SOMEONE
WHO CAN LOVE YOU BACK...

33:58.604 --> 34:03.375
THE WAY YOU DESERVE.

34:09.448 --> 34:11.617
- AAH!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

34:11.650 --> 34:13.419
- LETTING IN SOME SUNSHINE.

34:13.452 --> 34:14.753
- NO, LIGHT IS MY ENEMY.

34:14.786 --> 34:16.588
DARKNESS IS MY ONLY FRIEND.

34:16.622 --> 34:18.324
- HMM.
I'LL HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT.

34:18.357 --> 34:20.126
[objects thudding]

34:21.893 --> 34:23.562
- WHAT'S ALL THAT?

34:23.595 --> 34:26.365
- QUEER GUY IS ABOUT
TO WORK HIS FAIRY MAGIC.

34:26.398 --> 34:27.833
- THE LAST TIME
YOU WORKED YOUR FAIRY MAGIC,

34:27.866 --> 34:30.469
I ALMOST WOUND UP ENGAGED
TO TANYA THE TRUCKER.

34:30.502 --> 34:34.340
FIRST, WE NEED TO GET YOUR HAIR
BACK TO ITS NATURAL COLOR.

34:34.373 --> 34:37.343
WOULD YOU SAY "CHOCOLATE MOUSSE"
OR "AUTUMN IN UMBRIA"?

34:37.376 --> 34:40.179
- LOOK, EM, IT'S NO USE.

34:40.212 --> 34:42.581
I'M A CATERPILLAR WHO'S NEVER
GOING TO BE A BUTTERFLY.

34:42.614 --> 34:44.316
I'M JUST GOING TO BE
ONE OF THOSE OLD MEN

34:44.350 --> 34:45.784
WE ALWAYS MAKE FUN OF,

34:45.817 --> 34:47.786
THE ONES THAT ARE TRYING
TO LOOK YOUNG,

34:47.819 --> 34:50.589
WHO ARE ONLY
FOOLING THEMSELVES.

34:50.622 --> 34:52.258
- TEDDY,

34:52.291 --> 34:54.860
NO MATTER
WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE,

34:54.893 --> 34:56.462
THERE WILL ALWAYS
BE ONE PERSON

34:56.495 --> 35:01.133
WHO IS BLINDED
BY YOUR DAZZLING BEAUTY.

35:03.669 --> 35:05.904
WE'RE JUST GOING TO HELP
MOTHER NATURE ALONG.

35:05.937 --> 35:07.739
SO LET'S GET CRACKING,

35:07.773 --> 35:09.775
GIVE HER A LITTLE
PROD UP THE ASS.

35:09.808 --> 35:10.776
OKAY.

35:12.578 --> 35:14.213
- SO, WHAT HAPPENED?

35:14.246 --> 35:17.483
- MY PARENTS NEARLY SHIT.
- THEY DID?

35:17.516 --> 35:18.684
- WELL, LIKE, DUH.
YOU PRACTICALLY CALLED THEM

35:18.717 --> 35:21.353
A COUPLE OF FASCIST
HATE-MONGERS.

35:21.387 --> 35:22.521
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT CAN DO

35:22.554 --> 35:25.224
TO TWO LIFE-LONG
LIBERAL DEMOCRATS?

35:25.257 --> 35:28.360
- I WAS WORRIED
YOU MIGHT BE ANGRY.

35:28.394 --> 35:32.298
- ARE YOU KIDDING?
THEY SO DESERVED IT.

35:32.331 --> 35:36.368
I'M JUST SORRY
YOU HAD TO GO THROUGH THAT.

35:36.402 --> 35:39.705
BUT I'M--I'M GLAD
YOU DECIDED TO STAY.

35:39.738 --> 35:42.274
- YOU ARE?

35:45.344 --> 35:47.513
SO ARE YOU
DOING ANYTHING TONIGHT?

35:47.546 --> 35:49.548
WE COULD GO TO A MOVIE,
OR GET PIZZA,

35:49.581 --> 35:51.317
OR I COULD STEAL
YOUR FATHER'S CAR

35:51.350 --> 35:52.318
AND WE COULD DRIVE TO L.A.

35:52.351 --> 35:54.786
- [laughs]

35:54.820 --> 35:57.323
- I WAS JUST KIDDING.
- HEY, MATT.

35:57.356 --> 36:00.792
- HEY.

36:00.826 --> 36:03.262
WE'RE GOING TO THE MALL.
YOU WANT TO COME?

36:03.295 --> 36:06.298
- UM...SURE.

36:18.744 --> 36:20.679
- UH-HUH.

36:20.712 --> 36:22.714
WHAT A RELIEF.

36:22.748 --> 36:26.685
WELL, THANKS
FOR LETTING ME KNOW.

36:26.718 --> 36:28.287
THAT WAS MEL.
- MMM.

36:28.320 --> 36:30.289
- SHE WANTED
TO LET ME KNOW

36:30.322 --> 36:31.757
THAT OUR DAUGHTER
IS DOING FINE.

36:31.790 --> 36:33.459
- AH, THAT'S GOOD NEWS.

36:33.492 --> 36:34.993
- AND THAT I'M AN ASSHOLE.

36:35.026 --> 36:37.563
- [laughs]
SHE SAID THAT?

36:37.596 --> 36:39.898
- NO. I DID.

36:39.931 --> 36:41.700
- BUT YOU
WERE JUST LOOKING AFTER

36:41.733 --> 36:43.435
JENNY REBECCA'S
BEST INTERESTS.

36:43.469 --> 36:45.771
- ACTUALLY,
I WAS LOOKING AFTER MINE.

36:45.804 --> 36:48.874
INSTEAD OF THINKING ABOUT
WHAT WAS RIGHT FOR THE BABY,

36:48.907 --> 36:53.312
OR WHO SHE SHOULD BE WITH,
I WAS THINKING ABOUT ME.

36:53.345 --> 36:57.349
SO, I HAVE DECIDED
LINDSAY'S RIGHT.

36:57.383 --> 36:59.518
- UH, YOU'RE GOING
TO GIVE UP CUSTODY?

36:59.551 --> 37:02.288
- MM-MM.
I WOULD NEVER DO THAT.

37:02.321 --> 37:03.589
BUT I DO THINK THAT J.R.

37:03.622 --> 37:06.492
NEEDS TO SPEND MORE TIME
WITH HER MOTHER,

37:06.525 --> 37:10.462
INSTEAD OF PASSING
HER AROUND.

37:10.496 --> 37:13.932
SO WE NEED TO COME UP
WITH A NEW ARRANGEMENT,

37:13.965 --> 37:17.636
ONE THAT'S BEST FOR HER.

37:17.669 --> 37:22.741
- I THINK THAT'S A VERY WISE,
VERY LOVING DECISION.

37:22.774 --> 37:24.576
- [laughs]

37:26.412 --> 37:27.879
- NOW WHAT KIND
OF BEHAVIOR IS THAT

37:27.913 --> 37:30.048
FOR A PROPER MARRIED COUPLE?

37:30.081 --> 37:31.550
- IMPROPER.
- MMM.

37:31.583 --> 37:33.619
- UNDIGNIFIED.
- MMM-MM.

37:33.652 --> 37:35.421
FUN.

37:35.454 --> 37:37.423
- SINCE WHEN DO MARRIED PEOPLE
HAVE FUN?

37:37.456 --> 37:38.790
- YOU OUGHT TO TRY IT
SOME TIME.

37:38.824 --> 37:40.492
YOU MIGHT ENJOY IT.

37:40.526 --> 37:41.893
- GUYS, GUYS, GUYS,
GUYS, GUYS, HE'S HERE.

37:41.927 --> 37:42.894
HE'S HERE.

37:42.928 --> 37:44.396
- WHO'S HERE?

37:44.430 --> 37:45.964
- ALL RIGHT,
IT'S NOT DOLLY LEVI,

37:45.997 --> 37:47.366
IT'S ONLY TED.

37:47.399 --> 37:48.900
BUT I GOT HIM
OUT OF THE HOUSE.

37:48.934 --> 37:50.802
YOU SHOULD ONLY
KNOW WHAT IT TOOK.

37:50.836 --> 37:54.306
SO PRAISE HIM AND TELL HIM
HE LOOKS FABULOUS.

37:54.340 --> 37:57.843
GOT IT?

37:57.876 --> 38:00.446
- TED, YOU LOOK FABULOUS.

38:00.479 --> 38:02.714
TED, YOU LOOK FA--

38:02.748 --> 38:04.850
TED, YOU LOOK FABU--

38:04.883 --> 38:08.420
TED--
- HERE HE IS, HERE HE IS.

38:08.454 --> 38:11.089
- OH, MY GOD, HE REALLY
DOES LOOK FABULOUS.

38:11.122 --> 38:12.658
- THAT'S NOT TED.

38:12.691 --> 38:14.059
[door opening]

38:14.092 --> 38:17.563
THAT IS.

38:17.596 --> 38:18.930
- TED!
- WOW!

38:18.964 --> 38:21.400
- YOU LOOK
TEN YEARS YOUNGER.

38:21.433 --> 38:24.436
- WHAT A FANTASTIC JOB.

38:26.104 --> 38:27.806
- TED...

38:27.839 --> 38:30.442
YOU LOOK FABULOUS.

38:30.476 --> 38:31.610
- I DO?

38:31.643 --> 38:34.546
- WHAT DID I TELL YOU?

38:34.580 --> 38:36.882
- [exhales]

38:36.915 --> 38:40.452
- WELL, UH...
HEY, DRINKS ARE ON ME.

38:43.855 --> 38:47.092
- TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, HE
DOESN'T LOOK ALL THAT DIFFERENT.

38:47.125 --> 38:48.594
- I NEVER LOOKED AT HIM
ENOUGH TO KNOW.

38:48.627 --> 38:49.961
- THERE'S SOMETHING
AROUND THE EYES.

38:49.995 --> 38:54.433
HE LOOKS, UH...
RESTED, THAT'S IT.

38:54.466 --> 38:56.468
- IT DOESN'T MATTER THAT
HE DOESN'T LOOK ANY DIFFERENT.

38:56.502 --> 38:58.504
THE POINT IS,
HE THINKS HE DOES.

38:58.537 --> 39:00.606
IF TED CAN LOOK IN THE MIRROR
AND SEE A NEW MAN,

39:00.639 --> 39:03.975
A MAN WITH CONFIDENCE,
A MAN HE LIKES...

39:04.009 --> 39:08.580
WELL,
THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.

39:08.614 --> 39:11.016
[doorbell rings]
- GET READY, BABY,

39:11.049 --> 39:12.984
BECAUSE WHEN YOU
COME THROUGH THAT DOOR,

39:13.018 --> 39:17.122
YOU'RE GOING TO GET
SUCH A BIG SURP--

39:17.155 --> 39:20.158
SURPRISE.

39:20.191 --> 39:22.994
- GUESS YOU WEREN'T
EXPECTING ME.

39:23.028 --> 39:26.932
- I WAS JUST DOING
SOME IRONING.

39:36.775 --> 39:40.612
- I GUESS I GOT
A LITTLE CARRIED AWAY.

39:40.646 --> 39:43.515
IT'S THE FIRST TIME
THAT I WAS ABLE TO SHOW...

39:43.549 --> 39:44.750
ANOTHER WOMAN AFFECTION

39:44.783 --> 39:46.485
WITHOUT GETTING SLUGGED
BY DARRELL.

39:46.518 --> 39:48.153
- AND, GIRL,
YOU KEEP GOING.

39:48.186 --> 39:51.557
- I AM.
I'M LEAVING, DEB.

39:51.590 --> 39:53.659
THE DINER AND PITTSBURGH.

39:53.692 --> 39:55.494
- JUST 'CAUSE I SAID
THAT I COULDN'T BE

39:55.527 --> 39:57.663
THE GAL OF YOUR DREAMS
DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO GO.

39:57.696 --> 39:59.898
- I KNOW.
IT'S GOT NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU.

39:59.931 --> 40:02.100
- OH.
- NO, IT'S ME.

40:02.133 --> 40:05.937
WHEN I SEE SOMEONE
OR SOMETHING THAT I LIKE,

40:05.971 --> 40:09.941
I GET WHAT YOU
MIGHT CALL FIXATED.

40:11.209 --> 40:12.844
IT'S THE KIND
OF PERSON I AM.

40:12.878 --> 40:14.780
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN THAT WAY.

40:14.813 --> 40:16.848
EVER SINCE THE SHRIMP.

40:16.882 --> 40:18.183
- THE SHRIMP?

40:18.216 --> 40:19.851
- WHEN I WAS A GIRL,

40:19.885 --> 40:22.087
MY FOLKS USED TO TAKE ME
AND MY SISTER JANINE

40:22.120 --> 40:24.523
TO THE RAMADA
EVERY SUNDAY NIGHT

40:24.556 --> 40:26.592
FOR THE 8.95 SMORGASBORD,

40:26.625 --> 40:28.927
KIDS HALF-PRICE.

40:28.960 --> 40:31.697
THEY HAD EVERY KIND
OF FOOD YOU COULD IMAGINE.

40:31.730 --> 40:33.699
I WON'T GO THROUGH
THE ENTIRE MENU.

40:33.732 --> 40:35.200
- THANKS.

40:35.233 --> 40:38.704
- BUT I NEVER LOVED ANYTHING
AS MUCH AS THE SHRIMP.

40:38.737 --> 40:42.207
AND I KEPT GOING BACK
FOR MORE AND...

40:42.240 --> 40:44.543
MORE AND MORE AND...

40:44.576 --> 40:46.745
MY FOLKS SAID, "HEY, YOU KNOW,
TRY THE ROAST BEEF,

40:46.778 --> 40:49.748
"TRY THE CHICKEN CACCIATORE,
TRY THE STROGANOFF."

40:49.781 --> 40:53.118
AND I KNEW WHAT I LIKED
AND I STUCK TO IT.

40:55.020 --> 40:58.890
I KNOW IF I STAY HERE,
I'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO MOVE ON.

41:00.792 --> 41:03.629
I'LL JUST KEEP LOVING YOU.

41:03.662 --> 41:06.865
AND THAT WON'T DO EITHER OF US
MUCH GOOD.

41:09.935 --> 41:13.905
- I'M SURE, YOU KNOW,
IF YOU TRY THE ROAST BEEF,

41:13.939 --> 41:18.844
YOU'LL LIKE IT.

41:18.877 --> 41:22.881
- IT'S OKAY.
- SHIT.

41:27.085 --> 41:30.922
I'M THE ONE WHO'S
SUPPOSED TO BE COMFORTING YOU.

41:30.956 --> 41:34.626
- YOU ALREADY HAVE.

41:34.660 --> 41:38.163
I'M GOING TO BE
JUST FINE.

41:40.065 --> 41:43.168
- I DON'T HAVE
A SPECK OF DOUBT.

41:46.705 --> 41:49.675
- SINCE SHE WON'T BE COMING
TO MY APARTMENT ANY MORE...

41:49.708 --> 41:51.276
I THOUGHT YOU
COULD USE THEM.

41:51.309 --> 41:53.011
- YOU'RE NOT DOING THIS

41:53.044 --> 41:55.146
BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT
TO BE JENNY'S MOTHER,

41:55.180 --> 41:57.549
ARE YOU?

41:57.583 --> 42:00.218
- I'M MORE JENNY'S MOTHER NOW
THAN I EVER WAS,

42:00.251 --> 42:03.755
BECAUSE NOW I'M DOING
WHAT'S BEST FOR HER...

42:03.789 --> 42:06.725
NOT ME.

42:11.129 --> 42:14.065
- THANK YOU.

42:17.703 --> 42:22.073
- I HOPE YOU KNOW I NEVER
INTENDED FOR IT TO GET SO UGLY.

42:23.208 --> 42:24.643
- THAT'S HOW DIVORCES GO,

42:24.676 --> 42:26.177
ESPECIALLY WHEN
THERE ARE CHILDREN.

42:26.211 --> 42:29.948
I MEAN, WHY WOULD WE THINK
WE'D BE ANY DIFFERENT?

42:32.150 --> 42:35.954
- BECAUSE WE LOVED
EACH OTHER MORE?

42:40.959 --> 42:43.862
- BY THE WAY...

42:45.897 --> 42:49.334
IT'S FOR MY SHARE...
OF THE WATER HEATER.

42:49.367 --> 42:51.737
- [laughs]

42:55.774 --> 43:01.346
[mixed chatter]

43:01.379 --> 43:04.750
- [laughs]
AH, LIBERTY AVENUE.

43:04.783 --> 43:07.986
- IN ALL ITS GLORY.

43:08.019 --> 43:09.888
- MISS IT?

43:09.921 --> 43:13.158
- IT WAS MY LIFE
FOR A LONG TIME.

43:13.191 --> 43:15.694
EVERYWHERE I LOOK,
I STILL SEE ME...

43:15.727 --> 43:19.965
WALKING DOWN
THE STREET WITH BRIAN.

43:19.998 --> 43:21.967
HANGING OUT
WITH EMMETT AND TED.

43:22.000 --> 43:23.034
- THIS WAY.
THIS WAY.

43:23.068 --> 43:25.103
- CRUISING SOME HOT GUY.

43:25.136 --> 43:28.106
- AH.

43:28.139 --> 43:30.709
- BUT I'VE MOVED ON.

43:30.742 --> 43:35.847
SO, RATHER THAN MISSING
WHAT USED TO BE...

43:35.881 --> 43:40.351
I LOOK FORWARD
TO WHAT'S YET TO BE.

43:48.426 --> 43:51.062
- HUNTER?

43:51.096 --> 43:52.731
HUNTER?

43:52.764 --> 43:54.032
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

43:54.065 --> 43:55.333
- I GOT IT
FROM THAT TRICK LAST NIGHT.

43:55.366 --> 43:57.903
- RECONNECTING
WITH OLD FRIENDS.

43:57.936 --> 43:59.738
RENEWING SOCIAL TIES.

43:59.771 --> 44:00.739
WANT SOME?

44:00.772 --> 44:02.007
- NO, WE DO NOT.

44:02.040 --> 44:03.408
- COME ON, L-LET'S GO.

44:03.441 --> 44:05.176
- IT'S A SCHOOL NIGHT.

44:05.210 --> 44:07.913
- OOH! A SCHOOL NIGHT.
[laughs]

44:07.946 --> 44:10.415
- I'M NOT GOING BACK!
- HEY.

44:10.448 --> 44:13.084
YOU TOLD THE PRINCIPAL AND US
YOU HAD NO INTENTION OF LEAVING.

44:13.118 --> 44:15.186
- WELL, I CHANGED MY MIND.

44:15.220 --> 44:16.788
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE
BEEN THERE WITH PEOPLE

44:16.822 --> 44:19.057
WHO THINK
THEY'RE BETTER THAN ME.

44:19.090 --> 44:23.361
AT LEAST THESE GUYS...

44:23.394 --> 44:25.897
ACCEPT ME FOR WHO I AM.

44:25.931 --> 44:29.267
- WELL, IN CASE
YOU'VE FORGOTTEN, SO DO WE.

44:31.803 --> 44:35.206
NOW WE'RE GOING HOME.

44:35.240 --> 44:37.175
- HEY, BE SURE TO DO
WHAT YOUR DADDY SAYS.

44:37.208 --> 44:39.044
AND COLLECT UP FRONT.

44:39.077 --> 44:41.947
[laughs]

44:43.882 --> 44:46.217
[door opening]

44:51.089 --> 44:53.992
- HARD AT WORK?

44:56.027 --> 44:57.829
- HOW WAS BABYLON?

44:57.863 --> 45:00.498
- MM.
HARD AT PLAY.

45:00.531 --> 45:01.800
- WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HOME SO EARLY?

45:01.833 --> 45:03.201
IT'S ONLY 1:30.

45:03.234 --> 45:05.136
- MY ENFORCED CELIBACY IS OVER,
AND I WANTED YOU

45:05.170 --> 45:07.205
TO BE THE FIRST TO KNOW.
- [sighs]

45:07.238 --> 45:09.007
I'M TOUCHED.

45:09.040 --> 45:10.876
- WELL, YOU'LL BE A LOT MORE
THAN TOUCHED

45:10.909 --> 45:13.812
WHEN I'M DONE WITH YOU.

45:13.845 --> 45:16.748
- I HAVE WORK TO DO.

45:18.449 --> 45:20.218
- DO IT IN THE MORNING.

45:20.251 --> 45:23.154
I'M DOING IT NOW.

45:28.193 --> 45:32.363
HOW CAN YOU BE
SO FUCKING CASUAL?

45:32.397 --> 45:33.965
DON'T YOU EVER
GET TIRED OF IT?

45:33.999 --> 45:35.834
- [chuckles]

45:35.867 --> 45:40.371
TO GET TIRED OF SOMETHING
MEANS IT'S BECOME PREDICTABLE...

45:40.405 --> 45:42.240
UNSATISFYING...

45:42.273 --> 45:44.843
BORING.

45:44.876 --> 45:46.778
SORT OF LIKE WHERE I SUSPECT

45:46.812 --> 45:48.113
THIS CONVERSATION IS HEADED.

45:48.146 --> 45:50.181
- OR IT CAN MEAN
YOU'VE FOUND SOMETHING

45:50.215 --> 45:52.250
MORE SATISFYING,

45:52.283 --> 45:54.185
MORE MEANINGFUL.

45:54.219 --> 45:57.155
- [scoffs]

45:58.556 --> 46:02.293
AND WHAT WOULD THAT BE?

46:07.565 --> 46:11.136
I'M GOING TO TAKE A SHOWER.

46:11.169 --> 46:14.072
ARE YOU COMING TO BED?

46:14.105 --> 46:16.875
IN A WHILE.

46:16.908 --> 46:18.176
I HAVE SOME WORK TO FINISH.

46:18.209 --> 46:21.346
[dance music]

46:21.379 --> 46:25.183
- * SIAMESE TWINS
JOINED AT THE HEART *

46:25.216 --> 46:28.553
* NO SEPARATION

46:28.586 --> 46:32.157

46:35.326 --> 46:37.428

WHERE WE'VE BEEN *

46:53.879 --> 46:57.448
* FIGURE OUT WHAT LED
TO THE SHAPE WE'RE IN *

46:57.482 --> 47:01.086
