got nothing to be afraid of.

08:44.057 --> 08:47.292

10:50.416 --> 10:52.784

Cause of death,

And when he did,
he found religion.

11:33.993 --> 11:37.495
He left his life of crime,
and he went completely legit.

11:37.530 --> 11:39.063

seven years in prison.

11:39.098 --> 11:41.099
"Seven years"?

11:41.134 --> 11:44.235
Okay, so HPD thinks
he had a grudge.

11:44.270 --> 11:46.370
Well, considering the fact that
Kanuha's only been out of prison

11:46.405 --> 11:48.840
for six weeks, and then
the timing of this thing?

11:48.875 --> 11:50.808
A little suspicious.
What about HPD?

11:50.843 --> 11:52.243
Did they, uh,
get anything from this guy

11:52.278 --> 11:54.278
before he took off?

11:54.313 --> 11:55.880
Just a denial that he'd been
in contact with Akemoto

11:55.915 --> 11:57.281
at all in the last six weeks.
(cell phone chiming)

11:57.316 --> 11:58.983
STEVE:
All right, boys.

11:59.018 --> 12:01.352
Looks like we just found
our primary crime scene.

12:04.157 --> 12:07.358
(indistinct radio transmission)

12:10.563 --> 12:13.197
The van's registered
to Akemoto.

12:13.232 --> 12:15.233
CSU recovered a slug
from inside the vehicle.

12:15.268 --> 12:16.501
Lab's running ballistics.

12:16.536 --> 12:19.771
They also found a pair
of tire tracks nearby.

12:34.954 --> 12:37.488
All right, so, it looks like
Akemoto entered this location

12:37.523 --> 12:41.959
into his GPS, and got directions
from his shop in Waimalu.

12:41.994 --> 12:43.227
Okay, so...

12:43.262 --> 12:45.396
Kanuha, he lures

12:45.431 --> 12:46.798
<i>Akemoto out here.</i>

12:46.833 --> 12:48.866
<i>Calls him, tells him</i>
<i>that he needs help</i>

12:48.901 --> 12:50.802
<i>getting into his car.</i>
<i>Akemoto shows up.</i>

12:50.837 --> 12:53.137
<i>Kanuha kills him...</i>
<i>dumps him in the back</i>

12:53.172 --> 12:55.273
<i>of his car, takes off.</i>

12:55.308 --> 12:57.975
<i>Dumps him in Manoa where</i>
<i>he hopes no one will find him.</i>

12:58.010 --> 12:59.310
Well, we should
have some answers soon,

12:59.345 --> 13:01.546
'cause HPD impounded
Kanuha's car,

13:01.581 --> 13:03.381
and they're processing it now.

13:03.416 --> 13:05.983
Kono, where's Kanuha been living
since he got out of the joint?

13:06.018 --> 13:07.585
3118...

13:07.620 --> 13:09.153
Pukele Avenue.

13:09.188 --> 13:11.322
I got the address right here
on Akemoto's GPS.

13:11.357 --> 13:13.591
Kanuha lied to HPD

13:13.626 --> 13:16.394
about seeing Akemoto
since he's been out.

13:16.429 --> 13:18.797
Looks like it.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.199
If he lied to you about that,

13:21.234 --> 13:23.134
then what else
isn't he telling you?

13:23.169 --> 13:24.502
Bumpy, you got to
let us talk to him.

13:24.537 --> 13:25.603
If-if you think he's innocent

13:25.638 --> 13:27.305
and the Nation
can exonerate him,

13:27.340 --> 13:29.540
we need to hear
his side of the story.

13:29.575 --> 13:32.009
Commander McGarrett
gave his word

13:32.044 --> 13:34.145
that no one will step foot
on this land

13:34.180 --> 13:36.214

his guilt.

13:38.017 --> 13:39.483
I'm not "no one."

Keep them handy.

13:49.962 --> 13:52.230
Yes, sir.

13:52.265 --> 13:54.232
I'm not asking you
to trust a cop.

13:54.267 --> 13:57.235

at me for this murder,

14:40.613 --> 14:44.548

to distance myself from Akemoto.

14:44.583 --> 14:46.550

No.

15:07.373 --> 15:10.641
Kanuha, you got to understand
what this looks like.

15:10.676 --> 15:12.009
You just did
seven years in prison

15:12.044 --> 15:13.077
when your partner
didn't even do a day.

15:13.112 --> 15:15.212
You had to have been angry about that.
- Yeah.

15:15.247 --> 15:17.448
I was.

15:17.483 --> 15:19.650
For awhile.

15:19.685 --> 15:22.053

it could just as easily

15:22.088 --> 15:25.189
have been him in there
and me going free.

15:25.224 --> 15:28.459
Just the way things shook out.

15:28.494 --> 15:31.162
I didn't blame Akemoto
for what happened.

you're gonna be accused
of being a liar.

15:48.481 --> 15:50.348
Yeah, okay, thank you very much.

15:50.383 --> 15:52.717
Okay, the lab just finished

There was no traces of Akemoto's
blood or DNA in the trunk.

Plus, the tires on the car
don't match the tracks

15:57.790 --> 15:59.023
at the crime scene.

15:59.058 --> 16:00.358
Well, that doesn't
exonerate him.

16:00.393 --> 16:02.093
He could've stolen a car.
He could've borrowed a car.

16:02.128 --> 16:03.627
The-the problem is there's
still no hard evidence

16:03.662 --> 16:05.763

Akemoto's murder.

He's Kanuha's P.O.

He just came down here,
said he wanted to see you.

16:13.406 --> 16:15.106
When I heard about Kanuha, I...

16:15.141 --> 16:16.774
honestly, I couldn't believe it.

16:16.809 --> 16:19.210
The guy's been a model parolee
since he got out.

16:19.245 --> 16:21.145
All your model parolees,
Mr. Berris,

16:21.180 --> 16:23.514
do they run from the cops
and lie to them beforehand,

16:23.549 --> 16:25.249
stuff like that?
- No.

16:25.284 --> 16:27.251
They usually try and get
their lives back on track,

16:27.286 --> 16:29.253
which is exactly
what Kanuha was doing.

16:29.288 --> 16:31.022
He's been staying
away from trouble

16:31.057 --> 16:33.290
and hasn't missed a day of work
since he started.

16:33.325 --> 16:35.259
Where is he working?
Berris Hardware in Kapolei.

Berris Hardware?

16:37.196 --> 16:38.796
That's my brother's place.

16:38.831 --> 16:40.631
Kanuha was having
trouble finding work,

16:40.666 --> 16:42.333
so I asked my brother
for a favor.

16:42.368 --> 16:43.801
So far, no regrets.

16:43.836 --> 16:45.302
Let me ask you
something.

16:45.337 --> 16:47.638
Did Kanuha ever mention
Lance Akemoto?

16:47.673 --> 16:49.807
Yeah, the name came up
a few times.

16:49.842 --> 16:51.509
I got the feeling

16:51.544 --> 16:53.377
he harbored a little
resentment, sure.

16:53.412 --> 16:55.513
But he also talked about wanting
to get on with his life,

16:55.548 --> 16:56.680
and I believe
he was sincere.

16:56.715 --> 16:58.816
All right, so you think
he's innocent.

16:58.851 --> 17:00.217
Detective, I've been
doing this for awhile.

17:00.252 --> 17:01.519
And there are parolees

17:01.554 --> 17:03.454
that you just know
are going back inside.

17:03.489 --> 17:07.792
There are also a handful that...
you believe are gonna make it.

17:07.827 --> 17:09.560
Kanuha was one of them.

17:09.595 --> 17:11.228
That's all I'm saying.

22:06.859 --> 22:08.659
I don't think you understand
what's going on here.

22:08.694 --> 22:11.428
What I understand is that
on the other side of that gate

22:11.463 --> 22:13.897
is an ex-con and murder suspect
who, at the very least,

22:13.932 --> 22:15.866
evaded the police
and resisted arrest.

22:15.901 --> 22:17.501
And now those people
are protecting him.

22:17.536 --> 22:18.769
So tell me what I'm missing.

22:18.804 --> 22:20.571
What you're missing is
what this land means

22:20.606 --> 22:22.606
to these people--
it's all they have left.

22:22.641 --> 22:25.075
And any attempt to cross that
border will end in violence.

22:25.110 --> 22:26.610
STEVE: What
he's trying to say,

22:26.645 --> 22:27.678
sir...

22:27.713 --> 22:30.381
is that these people will die
to protect it, okay?

22:30.416 --> 22:31.482
Now, right now,

22:31.517 --> 22:32.550
we're in peaceful
negotiations.

22:32.585 --> 22:34.885
No one's gotten hurt.
No threats have been made.

22:34.920 --> 22:37.921
No one is in any danger.

22:37.956 --> 22:40.758
Now, do you really want to
explain to the attorney general

22:40.793 --> 22:43.027
why you took action
without provocation?

22:47.499 --> 22:48.899
(sighs quietly)

22:48.934 --> 22:50.801
I'll give you until sundown

22:50.836 --> 22:52.102
to resolve
the situation peacefully.

22:52.137 --> 22:53.804
After that, we're going in.

22:59.178 --> 23:01.745
DANNY: His mouth has not moved
in three and a half minutes.

23:01.780 --> 23:03.046
CHIN: You know,
maybe she's got him on hold.

23:03.081 --> 23:07.551
DANNY: No. No.
His nostrils are flaring.

23:07.586 --> 23:08.852
He's pacing like a maniac.

23:08.887 --> 23:10.654
And he just switched the
phone from his right hand

23:10.689 --> 23:13.190
to his left hand, which means
he wants to punch something.

23:13.225 --> 23:15.492
Well, you know your boy well.

23:15.527 --> 23:18.195
Governor says
it's out of her hands,

23:18.230 --> 23:20.964
and the marshals
are in charge now.

23:20.999 --> 23:22.499
Okay, well, you seem to
be taking that well.

23:22.534 --> 23:24.535
We got until sundown.
Let's work with that.

23:24.570 --> 23:25.970
Copy.

23:28.607 --> 23:30.007
(alarm blaring)
GROVER: Okay.

23:30.042 --> 23:32.676
Got your Jerry Alert--
what's up?

23:32.711 --> 23:35.112
Ah, so you're adding some
security to your bunker.

23:35.147 --> 23:36.647
What, this? Please.

23:36.682 --> 23:38.949
Everyone knows the best way
to store important items

23:38.984 --> 23:40.484
is to bury them underground.

23:40.519 --> 23:43.053
Yeah, I think I learned
that from the family dog.

23:43.088 --> 23:44.788
All right,
you mock me,

23:44.823 --> 23:46.690
but safes are
anything but secure.

23:46.725 --> 23:48.559
Allow me to demonstrate on one

23:48.594 --> 23:50.594
that happens to be
the exact same model

23:50.629 --> 23:53.997
as the one found
in Dylan Turner's home.

23:54.032 --> 23:56.066
Okay, I always love
a demonstration

23:56.101 --> 23:57.968
that starts with a
large metal hockey puck.

23:58.003 --> 23:59.803
When I started looking
into the robberies,

23:59.838 --> 24:02.206
I came across
a string of home invasions

24:02.241 --> 24:04.875
from all over the Island,
all which shared

24:04.910 --> 24:07.578
a similar M.O.--
three of the homes had safes,

24:07.613 --> 24:08.979
and in each case,

24:09.014 --> 24:10.848
the thief was able
to open the safe

24:10.883 --> 24:12.516
without damaging
the lock

24:12.551 --> 24:13.884
or leaving any fingerprints.

24:13.919 --> 24:16.620
A tough thing to do, unless...

24:16.655 --> 24:17.755
(clicking)

24:18.891 --> 24:21.859
...you have access
to a neodymium magnet.

24:21.894 --> 24:23.260
GROVER: Okay, so
where do you get

24:23.295 --> 24:25.028
one of these, uh, neo...

24:25.063 --> 24:26.029
Neodymium.

24:26.064 --> 24:27.231
Magnets, yeah.

24:27.266 --> 24:28.432
It's an industrial-strength
magnet,

24:28.467 --> 24:31.969
difficult to come by in a
strength powerful enough to move

24:32.004 --> 24:35.038
safe tumblers, unless you're
in the locksmith business.

24:35.073 --> 24:37.140
Oh, wait a minute--
Akemoto used to be

24:37.175 --> 24:40.611
in the locksmith
business for years.

24:40.646 --> 24:42.613
Okay, so what if Akemoto and
Kanuha were back in business.

24:42.648 --> 24:44.047
And then they get
into a disagreement

24:44.082 --> 24:45.282
and one turns on the other?

24:45.317 --> 24:47.551
Exactly what
I was thinking.

24:47.586 --> 24:49.887
That's nice work, Jerry.

24:49.922 --> 24:52.055
Oh, hey,
do either of you know who

24:52.090 --> 24:53.056
I turn expenses into?

24:53.091 --> 24:55.592
The safe and the magnet
weren't cheap-- cost me

24:55.627 --> 24:56.927
about $750 all in.

24:56.962 --> 24:58.228
You spent $750

24:58.263 --> 25:00.097
on a visual aid?

25:00.132 --> 25:02.599
Well, at least the sock
was mine.

25:02.634 --> 25:04.768
GROVER: Yeah,
so is the safe and that

25:04.803 --> 25:07.004
fancy-ass magnet-- why don't you
see if you can draw some money

25:07.039 --> 25:08.772
out of the bank
with that thing.

25:08.807 --> 25:10.774
KONO:
See you later, Jerry.

25:10.809 --> 25:13.110
(Grover chuckles)

25:13.145 --> 25:15.312
That's a great theory,
but do we have any evidence

25:15.347 --> 25:17.548
that Kanuha and Akemoto
were pulling jobs again?

25:17.583 --> 25:18.949
(line beeping)

25:18.984 --> 25:20.584
Kono?

25:29.161 --> 25:30.360
What did you do?

25:30.396 --> 25:32.095
Cutting off communications
helps to contain the situation.

25:32.130 --> 25:34.064
If you need to make a call,
we have a sat phone.

25:34.099 --> 25:35.866
You really think
this is the best way

25:35.901 --> 25:36.900
to resolves things peacefully?

25:36.935 --> 25:39.937
(horn honking)

25:47.846 --> 25:49.813
What's going on here?

25:49.848 --> 25:52.082
Sir, we told him he's not
allowed to cross over.

25:52.117 --> 25:54.084
I've got four ice chests
full of ono back there.

25:54.119 --> 25:55.953
If I don't go in,
my family doesn't eat.

25:56.855 --> 25:59.122
Tell your men
to let him through.

25:59.157 --> 26:00.891
This is a standoff, Lieutenant.

26:00.926 --> 26:01.959
They can't come and go
as they please.

26:01.994 --> 26:03.794
Turn him away.

26:03.829 --> 26:06.296
Hey. You don't get
to walk away from this.

26:06.331 --> 26:07.864
I can't let them
call the shots.

26:07.899 --> 26:10.233
In 15 minutes, we're cutting
the water and power as well.

26:10.268 --> 26:11.167
You said we had until sundown.

26:11.203 --> 26:13.103
I plan on keeping my word,
but until then,

26:13.138 --> 26:15.105
I have other options
and I'm going to use them.

26:15.140 --> 26:17.240
To do what-- provoke them?

26:17.275 --> 26:18.241
Make them give you

26:18.276 --> 26:20.243
the excuse you need
to throw them all in jail?

26:20.278 --> 26:22.245
I'm trying to get them to see
that protecting a murderer

26:22.280 --> 26:24.214
isn't worth it.

26:24.249 --> 26:25.248
That decisions like
this have consequences.

26:25.283 --> 26:26.717
Believe it or not,
Lieutenant,

26:26.752 --> 26:29.920
I do want a peaceful resolution.

26:38.030 --> 26:40.598
Still. I still can't
read your mind.

26:41.433 --> 26:43.000
Excuse me?

26:43.035 --> 26:44.268
You get that look

26:44.303 --> 26:47.004
on your face like I'm supposed
to know what you're thinking,

26:47.039 --> 26:48.205
but I-I-I don't.

26:48.240 --> 26:50.140
Huh. You know, it's funny.

26:50.175 --> 26:53.677
There's two things on this earth
that I am very grateful for.

26:53.712 --> 26:56.780
one is that you cannot read
my mind; the second is

26:56.815 --> 26:58.949
this seat belt right here.
Only two?

26:58.984 --> 27:00.651
Just two? Just--

27:00.686 --> 27:02.185
Not the birth of your
daughter or getting to know

27:02.220 --> 27:03.687
your beautiful little boy?

27:03.722 --> 27:04.955
Just me not having a superpower

27:04.990 --> 27:06.223
and your seat belt-- that's it?

27:06.258 --> 27:07.290
Right now, yeah.

27:07.325 --> 27:09.359
Well, be glad
you can't read mine.

27:09.394 --> 27:10.994
No, no,
I-I can read yours.

27:11.029 --> 27:12.095
Oh, you can read mine?
Oh, yeah.

27:12.130 --> 27:13.096
Yeah.
- What am I thinking?

27:13.131 --> 27:13.963
You're-you're hungry.

27:13.999 --> 27:16.266
Very hungry.
You're thinking about wings.

27:16.301 --> 27:18.368
Wondering if I have
my wallet in my pocket.

27:18.403 --> 27:20.003
You're also probably thinking

27:20.038 --> 27:22.839
about that new issue
of<i> Guns & Ammo</i>

27:22.874 --> 27:24.341
that you got in the mail
this morning, huh?

27:24.376 --> 27:26.777
Other than that, it's pretty
echo-y in there, I'm guessing.

27:26.812 --> 27:27.911
Used to when I met you,
you were funny.

27:27.946 --> 27:28.845
I actually thought
you were funny.

27:28.881 --> 27:30.714
You didn't,
you didn't say I was wrong.

27:30.749 --> 27:32.849
Okay, Daniel,

27:32.884 --> 27:35.118
if I could read your mind...

27:35.153 --> 27:36.853
Daniel...
If you could read my mind,

27:36.888 --> 27:39.956
you would know that I was
thinking that Lou was right.

27:39.991 --> 27:41.858
We should've just
rushed in there this morning,

27:41.893 --> 27:43.960
and the Feds wouldn't be doing
our job for us.

27:43.995 --> 27:46.930
You're wrong. We needed to show
them respect for their land.

27:46.965 --> 27:49.099
It was the only way we
could avoid people getting hurt.

27:49.134 --> 27:51.401
I don't know, I don't know.
It seems to me now a lot more

27:51.436 --> 27:53.336
people are gonna get hurt
and it's all over a fugitive.

27:53.371 --> 27:55.806
And Bumpy and his,
uh, group,

27:55.841 --> 27:56.873
they are the same people
that took over

27:56.908 --> 27:57.974
the palace a couple
of years ago.

27:58.009 --> 27:59.076
Anybody else you would label

27:59.111 --> 28:00.777
as stone-cold criminals.

28:00.812 --> 28:02.145
I don't see what the difference is.
(phone ringing)

28:02.180 --> 28:03.714
The difference is
it was their palace first.

28:03.749 --> 28:04.781
Kono, what
do you got?

28:04.816 --> 28:06.216
Dylan Turner

28:06.251 --> 28:07.350
just got back to Oahu.

28:07.385 --> 28:08.351
He was able to give us
a detailed list

28:08.386 --> 28:10.153
of all the items
that were stolen from his house.

28:10.188 --> 28:11.755
One of the items was a tablet

28:11.790 --> 28:13.857
with mobile broadband--
we were able to ping it

28:13.892 --> 28:14.858
and get you a location.

28:14.893 --> 28:15.893
Great, where is it?

28:24.236 --> 28:26.269
So, the manager I.D.'d a photo

28:26.304 --> 28:28.839
of Kanuha Noe, but he
rented a storage unit

28:28.874 --> 28:30.407
under a different name.

28:32.277 --> 28:33.844
Okay.

28:33.879 --> 28:36.847
Let's see what's behind
door number one.

28:39.050 --> 28:40.117
A room full of
stolen merch.

28:40.152 --> 28:42.019
Yep. Flat screen TV's.

28:43.889 --> 28:45.756
Wireless speakers.

28:45.791 --> 28:49.259
Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

28:49.294 --> 28:51.294
I always wanted one of these.

28:51.329 --> 28:53.363
You ain't gonna use that, are you?
- (buzzing)

28:53.398 --> 28:54.230
What if belonged to some

28:54.266 --> 28:56.366
big greasy biker
with hair on his back?

28:56.401 --> 28:57.200
I'm kind of a hairy man

28:57.235 --> 28:59.402
with a little bit of hair
on my back.

28:59.437 --> 29:01.038
See, that's just nasty.

29:02.574 --> 29:03.840
Y'all.

29:03.875 --> 29:05.375
(buzzing stops)

29:06.211 --> 29:08.178
Glock 29.

29:08.213 --> 29:09.213
Looks like we found
our murder weapon.

29:22.460 --> 29:23.292
CHIN:
<i>Kanuha,</i>

29:23.328 --> 29:25.061
we know you rented
the storage unit.

29:25.096 --> 29:27.130
And right now our lab's
(punches wall)

29:27.165 --> 29:29.199
running ballistics on the gun
we found inside to confirm

29:29.234 --> 29:31.034
it is the murder weapon!

29:31.069 --> 29:32.335
So you can stand there
and tell me you're innocent

29:32.370 --> 29:34.337
all day long,
but we both know you're lying!

29:34.372 --> 29:36.273
KANUHA:
All right, all right!

29:36.308 --> 29:38.575
(panting):
I stole all that stuff,

29:38.610 --> 29:41.878
including that gun,
but I didn't kill Akemoto.

29:41.913 --> 29:42.913
Why should I believe you?

29:42.948 --> 29:44.548
Because it's the truth.

29:44.583 --> 29:46.483
Here's the truth--
a man was murdered

29:46.518 --> 29:49.186
and you ran,
and every single thing

29:49.221 --> 29:51.054
that we've discovered since then
points to you

29:51.089 --> 29:52.589
as having pulled
the trigger!

29:52.624 --> 29:53.290
Kanuha.

29:54.492 --> 29:55.993
Come here.

29:58.096 --> 29:59.196
Look in my eyes.

30:00.365 --> 30:02.866
Tell me you didn't kill Akemoto.

30:02.901 --> 30:04.902
I didn't kill Akemoto.

30:07.539 --> 30:09.239
I believe him.

30:09.274 --> 30:11.341
I believe that you and your
partner were pulling jobs again.

30:11.376 --> 30:13.610
The two of you got into a
beef and then you shot him.

30:13.645 --> 30:15.111
No, no!

30:15.146 --> 30:16.947
Akemoto had nothing to do
with those robberies.

30:16.982 --> 30:18.014
You stole his tools,
he confronted you,

30:18.049 --> 30:19.049
and then you killed him!

30:19.084 --> 30:20.483
No, he loaned me that stuff.

30:20.518 --> 30:21.585
Please.

30:21.620 --> 30:23.520
Believe me--
I'm telling the truth.

30:23.555 --> 30:25.155
There's no way that gun's
the murder weapon,

30:25.190 --> 30:27.190
because I didn't kill Akemoto.

30:27.225 --> 30:29.960
Why didn't you tell me
about those robberies?

30:29.995 --> 30:31.428
I was afraid you'd give me up.

30:31.463 --> 30:34.231
And then you guys would try
to pin the murder on me.

30:34.266 --> 30:38.101
I've done a lot of bad things
in my life, but not this.

30:38.136 --> 30:40.170
I'm being set up!

30:41.973 --> 30:44.541
Chin,<i> hele mai.</i>

30:54.619 --> 30:56.586
He's lying to you.

30:56.621 --> 30:58.989
Just like he's been lying
from the start.

30:59.024 --> 31:03.193
I want you to know we have every
intention of handing him over.

31:03.228 --> 31:05.495
Our Nation will never
protect a criminal.

31:05.530 --> 31:09.032
But we agreed to hand him over
only after you proved

31:09.067 --> 31:11.534
he murdered Akemoto.

31:11.569 --> 31:13.937
You haven't done that yet.

31:13.972 --> 31:15.605
Until then,
I'm going to protect

31:15.640 --> 31:19.142
Kanuha and my people.

31:19.177 --> 31:21.211
MAN:
All right, let's keep moving.

31:22.247 --> 31:24.381
Everybody into the shelter.

31:29.454 --> 31:32.122
Kanuha confessed
to the robberies.

31:32.157 --> 31:33.456
Then where the hell is he?

31:33.491 --> 31:35.325
He's still maintaining
his innocence

31:35.360 --> 31:37.160
as far as the
murder goes.

31:37.195 --> 31:38.561
Let me get this straight.

31:38.596 --> 31:41.698
Those people are now
openly harboring a criminal?

31:41.733 --> 31:43.566
There's a big difference
between a thief and a murderer,

31:43.601 --> 31:46.002
as far as they're concerned.

31:46.037 --> 31:47.404
They will surrender him
right after

31:47.439 --> 31:49.339
we find out who
murdered Akemoto.

31:51.076 --> 31:52.475
Storming this
place right now

31:52.510 --> 31:55.178
is gonna get a lot of people
hurt on both sides.

31:55.213 --> 31:56.346
The sensible
play here is,

31:56.381 --> 32:00.183
is to hold off,
and close this case.

32:00.218 --> 32:02.018
I'm sending units
to take positions

32:02.053 --> 32:03.687
along this compound's perimeter.

32:03.722 --> 32:06.423
The Nation has less than an hour
before my men go in.

32:06.458 --> 32:08.191
And when they do...

32:08.226 --> 32:10.227
they'll only have
themselves to blame.

32:17.035 --> 32:18.234
Kono!

32:18.269 --> 32:19.402
Hey.
- Hey.

32:19.437 --> 32:21.338
I just got off the phone
with the lab.

32:21.373 --> 32:23.006
Ballistics got a hit
on the gun you found.

32:23.041 --> 32:24.474
They confirmed
it is the murder weapon.

32:24.509 --> 32:26.376
They also pulled
a partial print off of it

32:26.411 --> 32:27.610
that belongs to Kanuha.

32:27.645 --> 32:29.145
All right, there it is there.
We're done.

32:29.180 --> 32:31.448
But I'm not so sure
that Kanuha's our guy.

32:31.483 --> 32:32.416
Hear me out.

32:32.451 --> 32:34.150
While I was waiting
for ballistic results,

32:34.185 --> 32:35.352
I pulled
the surveillance footage

32:35.387 --> 32:36.453
from the storage facility.

32:36.488 --> 32:38.355
I was hoping to catch Akemoto
on camera to confirm

32:38.390 --> 32:40.390
he was involved
in the robberies.

32:40.425 --> 32:43.360
When I didn't,
I pulled the access records

32:43.395 --> 32:44.995
and I noticed that
someone typed in

32:45.030 --> 32:46.296
the unit's gate code
earlier today.

32:46.331 --> 32:47.764
Wait, hang on--

32:47.799 --> 32:50.367
Kanuha's been holed
up in his compound

32:50.402 --> 32:53.403
since last night and Akemoto's
been dead for two days.

32:53.438 --> 32:55.705
So who got into the unit?

32:55.740 --> 32:58.274
I'm thinking it was this guy--
Devon Berris.

32:58.309 --> 32:59.375
Traffic cam footage
shows his car

32:59.410 --> 33:01.244
pulling into the parking lot
of the storage facility

33:01.279 --> 33:03.580
a few minutes before
the gate code was entered.

33:03.615 --> 33:06.116
Berris, Berris-- as in, uh,
Kanuha's parole officer.

33:06.151 --> 33:08.184
Yeah, so Devon Berris
is John's brother.

33:08.219 --> 33:09.586
Right.
He owns a hardware store.

33:09.621 --> 33:11.021
Yeah, we know.
He, uh, he came by.

33:11.056 --> 33:12.122
Yeah, he gave him a job.

33:12.157 --> 33:13.757
Yeah, so I'm thinking
that Kanuha did

33:13.792 --> 33:15.658
a lot more than just work
at the store for him.

33:15.693 --> 33:16.593
What do you mean?

33:16.628 --> 33:18.261
If Devon Berris knew about

33:18.296 --> 33:19.295
Kanuha's storage facility,
Yeah?

33:19.330 --> 33:20.363
well, then he had to have known

33:20.398 --> 33:21.531
that he was back
in the robbery game.

33:21.566 --> 33:22.665
Wait, wait, you think
all three of them

33:22.700 --> 33:24.034
are in this together--

33:24.069 --> 33:25.702
Devon Berris, Kanuha, Akemoto?

33:25.737 --> 33:27.303
Maybe.

33:27.338 --> 33:28.805
Or maybe the brother
of a parole officer

33:28.840 --> 33:31.141
was taking advantage
of an ex-con.

33:31.176 --> 33:32.275
Steal for me or else.

33:32.311 --> 33:34.144
Or else I tell my brother
that you crossed the line

33:34.179 --> 33:35.345
and he puts you back in jail.

33:35.380 --> 33:37.814
Okay, fine, let's say I buy
all that-- why kill Akemoto?

33:37.849 --> 33:40.017
Let's go ask Devon Berris.

33:54.232 --> 33:56.233
(birds chirping in distance)

34:09.347 --> 34:11.348
(heavy whirring)

34:26.197 --> 34:27.597
What are they doing?

34:27.632 --> 34:29.199
It's aerial surveillance.

34:29.234 --> 34:31.534
They're preparing to move in.

34:31.569 --> 34:34.104
You could stop them
by giving up Kanuha.

34:34.139 --> 34:35.605
You know I can't do that.

34:35.640 --> 34:37.607
Excuse me, Chin.

34:37.642 --> 34:39.576
That gentleman...

34:39.611 --> 34:40.710
he asked to
speak to you.

34:40.745 --> 34:42.112
Says it's urgent.

34:42.147 --> 34:44.147
Thanks, Duke.

34:45.383 --> 34:47.217
How can I help you?
Lieutenant Kelly.

34:47.252 --> 34:48.351
I'm Devon Berris.

34:48.387 --> 34:50.253
I believe you've been in contact
with my brother John.

34:50.288 --> 34:52.188
You're Kanuha's boss.

34:52.223 --> 34:53.756
That's right.
I heard what was going on.

34:53.791 --> 34:55.191
I thought maybe I could help.

34:55.226 --> 34:56.159
How so?

34:56.194 --> 34:57.260
I think I can convince Kanuha

34:57.295 --> 34:59.496
to surrender.

34:59.531 --> 35:00.897
Look, I've gotten
to know Kanuha.

35:00.932 --> 35:02.465
He's not a killer.

35:02.500 --> 35:03.766
I just want to talk to him.

35:03.801 --> 35:05.835
Let him know that
he's got my full support.

35:05.870 --> 35:08.505
He needs to know that he's got
friends on the outside.

35:08.540 --> 35:10.206
Me, my brother--

35:10.241 --> 35:13.410
we'll make sure
he gets a fair shake.

35:15.847 --> 35:16.847
What do you think?

35:47.412 --> 35:48.912
Yeah, I need to be connected
to the U.S. marshal's outpost

35:48.947 --> 35:50.580
immediately, please.

35:50.615 --> 35:51.948
Yeah, I'll hold.

35:51.983 --> 35:53.850
Here's what
I don't get.

35:53.885 --> 35:55.518
When we got Kanuha
on those robberies,

35:55.553 --> 35:57.587
why didn't he give us
Devon Berris then?

35:57.622 --> 35:58.855
Because, just like
you and Kono said,

35:58.890 --> 36:00.490
the guy's been under
this other guy's thumb.

36:00.525 --> 36:01.391
He's too scared
to say anything.

36:01.426 --> 36:03.826
Yeah, I need
Lieutenant Chin Ho Kelly.

36:03.861 --> 36:05.328
This is Danny Williams, please.

36:15.807 --> 36:17.807
I want you to post two
men on every sniper.

36:17.842 --> 36:19.909
I want 'em to feel HPD
breathing down their necks.

36:19.944 --> 36:21.844
Copy that.
Lieutenant Kelly.

36:21.879 --> 36:23.580
Commander McGarrett
on the line for you.

36:25.316 --> 36:26.683
Hey, Steve.

36:26.718 --> 36:27.951
Yeah, Chin, listen,
we need everybody

36:27.986 --> 36:29.552
to stand down immediately,
all right?

36:29.587 --> 36:32.355
We're currently on the way
to question a new suspect,

36:32.390 --> 36:33.523
Devon Berris.

36:33.558 --> 36:35.325
Berris?

36:35.360 --> 36:37.393
We just let him
inside to see Kanuha.

36:37.428 --> 36:38.962
What?
He's there now?

36:38.997 --> 36:40.697
Yeah, he showed up
two minutes ago.

36:40.732 --> 36:42.365
(engine revs)

36:52.877 --> 36:53.810
What have you told them?

36:54.812 --> 36:57.313
I barely told them anything.

36:57.348 --> 36:58.481
And nothing about you.

36:58.516 --> 37:01.218
Good. Let's keep it that way.

37:02.020 --> 37:04.421
But they still think
I killed Akemoto.

37:05.790 --> 37:08.324
Except we both know
it was you, wasn't it?

37:08.359 --> 37:09.993
You were smart to keep
your mouth shut.

37:10.028 --> 37:11.594
Like anyone's gonna believe me.

37:11.629 --> 37:12.629
Yeah, you got that right.

37:12.664 --> 37:13.796
Why'd you do it?

37:13.831 --> 37:15.331
'Cause I had to.

37:15.366 --> 37:17.734
Couldn't trust your partner
to keep his mouth shut.

37:17.769 --> 37:19.402
You never should've told him.
He was my friend.

37:19.437 --> 37:21.638
He wasn't gonna say anything.

37:21.673 --> 37:22.606
You're wrong.

37:22.641 --> 37:24.474
He told me that he was gonna
go to HPD, okay?

37:24.509 --> 37:25.608
Both of us would've gone down.

37:25.643 --> 37:28.011
I did what
I had to do.

37:28.046 --> 37:29.646
Here's what's
gonna happen now.

37:29.681 --> 37:31.948
You're gonna tell them that
Akemoto approached you

37:31.983 --> 37:33.516
after you got out,

37:33.551 --> 37:35.885
talked you into
doing those robberies.

37:35.920 --> 37:36.986
They'll believe that.

37:37.021 --> 37:39.422
I mean, it was his equipment
that you used, right?

37:39.457 --> 37:42.025
Then you'll say that
you tried to walk away,

37:42.060 --> 37:43.459
but Akemoto wouldn't let you.

37:43.494 --> 37:44.627
There was a struggle.

37:44.662 --> 37:45.628
You grabbed the gun
in self-defense.

37:45.663 --> 37:47.964
I'll talk to my brother.

37:47.999 --> 37:49.766
Get him involved.

37:49.801 --> 37:50.900
You can plead down.

37:50.935 --> 37:52.802
He'll take care of you
on the inside.

37:52.837 --> 37:55.972
Line up a early release for,
uh, good behavior.

37:56.007 --> 37:57.574
Are you listening to me?

38:01.012 --> 38:03.680
He came to you, huh?
- What?

38:03.715 --> 38:06.683
Akemoto wanted you
to let me go, didn't he?

38:06.718 --> 38:08.051
He was trying
to help me.

38:08.086 --> 38:09.485
He felt guilty
for what happened

38:09.520 --> 38:10.887
all those years ago.

38:10.922 --> 38:12.789
And he was trying
to make it right.

38:12.824 --> 38:15.525
You think Akemoto
cared about you?

38:15.560 --> 38:17.593
He went on with his life
while you were rotting away--

38:17.628 --> 38:19.462
(shouts)

38:19.497 --> 38:21.931
(both grunting)

38:32.477 --> 38:33.543
Freeze!

38:33.578 --> 38:35.078
He attacked me.

38:35.113 --> 38:36.779
We know what you did,
Berris.

38:36.814 --> 38:38.881
CSU's processing the car
right now, and I'm betting

38:38.916 --> 38:41.484
they're gonna find
traces of blood in the trunk.

38:43.388 --> 38:45.355
It's over.

38:46.824 --> 38:49.592
Look at me!
Look at me!

38:50.428 --> 38:51.861
Put the gun down.
