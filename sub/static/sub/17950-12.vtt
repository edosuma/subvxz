05:09.677 --> 05:11.144

05:13.414 --> 05:16.216
MARTIN SHARKUS.

05:16.216 --> 05:19.387
THE MAN TOOK A SIMPLE MAC AND
CHEESE RECIPE--A FOOD I HATE--

[cackling]

05:57.491 --> 05:58.492

05:58.492 --> 06:00.428

06:06.800 --> 06:09.970
[cackling]

06:09.970 --> 06:11.439
YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:11.439 --> 06:14.141
I GET THAT.

06:14.141 --> 06:15.643
THAT'S A WRAP, EVERYBODY!

06:28.589 --> 06:30.858
AND NOW SHE'S BACK WITHOUT
SAYING, "LET'S GET TOGETHER."

06:30.858 --> 06:32.092
I'M MAD.

06:32.092 --> 06:33.894
YOUR DREAM IS TO KISS HER.

06:33.894 --> 06:36.296
SO GO PUT ON A NICE OUTFIT

TWEEN CHOICE PRESENTER FASHIONS

06:49.777 --> 06:51.545

OF EVER GETTING A GIRLFRIEND.

07:07.695 --> 07:09.262
- WAIT.
WHAT ABOUT THE JENNIFERS?

07:09.262 --> 07:10.864
- THAT WAS ONE DAY
WITH EACH OF THEM,

07:10.864 --> 07:13.734
AND ONE DATE DOES NOT COUNT
AS A GIRLFRIEND.

07:13.734 --> 07:14.868
- RIGHT.

07:14.868 --> 07:16.804
AND THEN THEY JUST DISAPPEARED.

07:16.804 --> 07:18.639
- [whispers] LIKE THEY WERE
GONE WITH THE WIND.

07:18.639 --> 07:20.073
[wind howling]

07:23.110 --> 07:26.113
[dance-pop music]

07:26.113 --> 07:33.153

07:34.822 --> 07:37.024
YOU'RE BACK!

07:37.024 --> 07:38.626
SORT OF.

07:38.626 --> 07:39.960

07:45.533 --> 07:47.300
JENNIFER STILL HAS
ONE MORE SCENE TO SHOOT

07:47.300 --> 07:48.936
WHERE SHE GETS HER TAIL BACK.

07:48.936 --> 07:53.273
- AND WE'RE SO SORRY FOR HOW WE
TREATED CARLOS ALL THOSE TIMES,

07:53.273 --> 07:54.975
SO WE'RE BACK FOR HIM TOO.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.243
- [gasps]

07:56.243 --> 07:57.778
all: THIS HIM?

07:57.778 --> 07:59.647
- AFTER BEING AWAY
FOR TEN MONTHS,

07:59.647 --> 08:01.615
IT MADE US REALIZE
THAT THERE'S NO ONE SWEETER--

08:01.615 --> 08:03.551
- OR CUTER THAN CARLOS.

08:03.551 --> 08:04.985
ISN'T THAT RIGHT,
CUTOUT JENNIFER?

08:06.720 --> 08:07.788
- UH...

08:07.788 --> 08:09.557
- BUT YOU CAN ONLY PICK
ONE OF US.

08:09.557 --> 08:11.659
- AND WE KNOW
THAT'S A TOUGH DECISION,

08:11.659 --> 08:14.461
SO WE'RE GONNA GIVE YOU TILL THE
END OF TWEEN CHOICE TO DECIDE.

08:14.461 --> 08:15.428
both: MM-HMM.

08:18.566 --> 08:20.167
- OH, THE JENNIFERS ARE BACK!

08:20.167 --> 08:21.569
all: AND THEY'RE NICE.

08:21.569 --> 08:23.136
- AND THEY WANT ME.

08:23.136 --> 08:26.139
I GUESS THIS IS THE NIGHT
ALL OUR DREAMS COME TRUE.

08:29.977 --> 08:31.879
- DID YOU GET 'EM?
DID YOU GET 'EM?

08:35.015 --> 08:36.016
YES!

08:36.016 --> 08:37.450

OF MEETING AUSTIN MAHONE

08:37.450 --> 08:39.386
WILL FINALLY COME TRUE.

08:39.386 --> 08:42.590
- YES, BUT IT WILL BE
A NIGHTMARE IF YOU LOSE THESE,

08:42.590 --> 08:44.357
BECAUSE THEY CANNOT BE REPLACED.

08:44.357 --> 08:47.327
- WHICH MEANS I WILL PUT THEM
IN A SAFE PLACE.

08:47.327 --> 08:48.962
- NO, I WILL.

08:48.962 --> 08:51.398
CAN'T YOU RISK YOU
LOSING MY TICKET TO AUSTIN.

08:51.398 --> 08:52.666
- OKAY.

SO ALTHOUGH IT FALLS
FROM THE SKY,

16:23.116 --> 16:25.618
IT MUST SIT STORED

19:41.981 --> 19:43.850
I BET YOU A SPY
COULD HELP US FIND IT.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.151
WE SHOULD GO FIND ALEXA.

19:45.151 --> 19:47.354
- ALEXA IS NOT A SPY.

19:47.354 --> 19:48.788
AND WE'RE STILL UP
FOR THREE AWARDS,

19:48.788 --> 19:51.258
SO PLEASE DO NOT LEAD US

OR IS IT KUNG CHEESE?

21:07.834 --> 21:09.402
CHEESE FU.

21:09.402 --> 21:11.538

24:21.360 --> 24:22.595

24:25.665 --> 24:26.966

24:39.979 --> 24:41.548
- HOW DID I FORGET THAT?

24:41.548 --> 24:44.083
- SORRY, MOM,
BUT NOTHING IS GONNA MAKE THIS

24:44.083 --> 24:45.585
A TWEEN CHOICE AWARD

25:40.239 --> 25:42.642
THIS WILL NEVER BE A VIP PARTY.

25:42.642 --> 25:45.511
[doorbell rings]

25:45.511 --> 25:48.514
YOU INVITED PALMWOODS TEENS?

WITH LUCY STONE.

26:04.230 --> 26:05.397
COMING UP.

26:05.397 --> 26:06.899
- IF JAMES WANTS TO KISS LUCY,

26:06.899 --> 26:08.635
HE NEEDS TO BE NEXT TO HER.

26:08.635 --> 26:09.802

26:22.649 --> 26:23.883

- IT'S THAT MOMENT ON THE BIG
SCREEN THAT CAPTURES OUR HEARTS

27:02.488 --> 27:05.491
UNTIL THE GIRL IN THE MOVIE

27:05.491 --> 27:08.027
LEAVES FOR EUROPE
WITHOUT SAYING GOOD-BYE.

27:08.027 --> 27:09.028

- SHH!

27:19.171 --> 27:21.440
- NO, BECAUSE
WHAT THE GUY DOESN'T KNOW

27:21.440 --> 27:23.609
WAS...

27:23.609 --> 27:26.078
SHE CAME BACK FOR HIM.

27:26.078 --> 27:27.914

27:34.420 --> 27:36.322

27:44.764 --> 27:45.932

27:45.932 --> 27:47.734
THE DREAM TEAM STILL HAS
ONE MORE DREAM

27:47.734 --> 27:49.601
TO MAKE COME TRUE.

27:49.601 --> 27:51.237
[cheers and applause]

27:54.140 --> 27:55.742
- AND THE ONLY DREAM LEFT IS...

27:55.742 --> 27:57.209
both: CARLOS.

27:57.209 --> 27:59.946
both: CARLOS' GIRLFRIEND DREAM.

27:59.946 --> 28:02.148
- WE'RE SICK OF BEING NICE,

28:02.148 --> 28:04.583
AND WE WANT AN ANSWER NOW.

28:04.583 --> 28:06.886
- SO WHO DO YOU WANT
TO BE YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

28:08.821 --> 28:11.490
- UH...

28:11.490 --> 28:12.491

28:19.365 --> 28:21.768

ON YOU SINCE YOUR FIRST ALBUM.

28:21.768 --> 28:23.335
- WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

28:23.335 --> 28:24.370
- I'M SHY.

28:24.370 --> 28:25.504
- YOU?

28:25.504 --> 28:27.874
- WHAT CAN I SAY?
I'M A SHY SPY.

28:35.882 --> 28:37.449
- LET'S GET OUT OF HERE,
JENNIFERS.

28:37.449 --> 28:40.086
- I THINK ONE "D"
IS IN THE VIP ROOM.

28:42.654 --> 28:43.990
- BUT I HAVE TO WARN YOU.

28:43.990 --> 28:45.624
IT'S NOT EASY DATING A SPY.

28:45.624 --> 28:47.193
YOU NEVER KNOW
WHEN YOU MIGHT GET CAUGHT

28:47.193 --> 28:48.861
IN THE MIDDLE
OF A DANGEROUS MISSION.

28:48.861 --> 28:50.196
- [whispers] I DON'T CARE.

28:50.196 --> 28:51.397
- UH, YEAH, PARDON ME.

28:51.397 --> 28:52.531
DID YOU SAY DANGEROUS?

28:52.531 --> 28:53.966

28:53.966 --> 28:56.168
I CAN'T FIND SHARKUS'
CHEESY HEADQUARTERS,

28:56.168 --> 28:57.269
AND I NEED YOUR HELP.

28:59.839 --> 29:01.808
[fingers snap]
- DREAM TEAM IS IN.

29:01.808 --> 29:03.209

[fingers snap]

29:10.582 --> 29:12.351

29:12.351 --> 29:14.821
- SO WHAT'S YOUR PLAN, SHARKUS?

29:14.821 --> 29:16.889
- WHY DON'T I LET
SHARKY THE SHARK TELL YOU?

29:18.590 --> 29:21.127
THAT'S RIGHT. YOU DON'T TALK.
YOU'RE A SHARK.

29:21.127 --> 29:25.197
WHEN YOUR COMMERCIAL AIRS

29:25.197 --> 29:28.935
I WILL TRANSMIT MY HYPNO BEAM

[explosion]

29:43.549 --> 29:45.684
[shimmering tones]

29:48.620 --> 29:49.655
- DO WE GET TO KISS AGAIN?

29:49.655 --> 29:50.923
- MAYBE LATER.

29:50.923 --> 29:54.460
- WHICH WHEN VIEWED
WEARING MY CHEESE-D GLASSES

29:54.460 --> 29:56.896
WILL MAKE THEIR HEADS EXPLODE!

29:56.896 --> 29:59.031

29:59.031 --> 30:00.933

- OUR NIGHT OF DREAMS IS
GONNA END IN A CHEESY NIGHTMARE.

30:13.512 --> 30:17.016
- AN EARLIER TEST I DID
PROVED ITS EFFECTIVENESS.

30:20.719 --> 30:23.589
THAT WAS THE GESTURE.
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO IT THEN.

30:23.589 --> 30:25.057
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO SLIDE THE PANEL--

30:25.057 --> 30:26.758
THAT WAS THE GESTURE!
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU--

30:26.758 --> 30:29.028
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?
