01:21.846 --> 01:24.349
"You cannot walk away from love."

01:25.100 --> 01:28.728
That was the advertisement
in a Baltimore newspaper.

01:29.771 --> 01:32.607
And that is how he found her.

01:33.942 --> 01:37.612
She was a young woman
in need of a husband.

01:38.071 --> 01:40.907
And he was a man who wanted a wife.

02:00.969 --> 02:02.887
Too late to talk sense to him now.

02:02.929 --> 02:05.265
You can't marry her, Luis.
You've never met her.

02:05.348 --> 02:09.352
I meet her today. The boat from America
comes at 6:00, we marry at 9:00...

02:09.477 --> 02:11.020
...by 10:00, I'm back at work.

02:11.438 --> 02:13.898
Ridiculous. This is ridiculous.

02:13.982 --> 02:18.486
A man needs a wife, isn't that what
you've been telling me? Well... I sent for one.

02:18.570 --> 02:19.571
From America.

02:19.654 --> 02:21.197
What does she look like?

02:22.824 --> 02:25.994
Comes a day in every man's life
when a band is playing...

02:26.077 --> 02:30.540
...and he's the only one who can hear it.
Today is your day.

02:31.041 --> 02:32.667
I love you, woman.

02:33.418 --> 02:34.919
She is not beautiful.

02:35.211 --> 02:37.339
She is not meant to be beautiful...

02:37.422 --> 02:40.675
...just kind, true and young enough
to bear children.

02:41.801 --> 02:46.640
Go on. The sun will be up any minute.
The boat will be coming in.

02:48.642 --> 02:52.812
But what about love, Luis?
Doesn't love come into this at all?

02:53.188 --> 02:55.357
Love is not for me, Alan.

02:55.523 --> 02:57.776
Love is for those people who believe in it.

02:59.235 --> 03:00.320
Let's go.

03:01.655 --> 03:04.908
Why are you laughing at me?
You've been laughing at me all morning.

03:04.991 --> 03:07.494
Never mind. You go! Go on!

04:25.030 --> 04:27.866
No, this is not a love story.

04:28.533 --> 04:33.204
Butitis a story aboutlove,
and the powerit has over ourlife.

04:34.122 --> 04:36.958
The power to heal or destroy.

04:46.217 --> 04:48.720
and this is where the story begins.

05:05.153 --> 05:06.196
Mr. Vargas?

05:08.490 --> 05:09.991
Luis Vargas?

05:11.660 --> 05:13.662
You don't recognize me, do you?

05:17.666 --> 05:19.084
Miss Russell?

05:20.335 --> 05:21.503
Yes.

05:25.006 --> 05:26.341
Julia Russell?

05:28.510 --> 05:30.178
But this, this picture--

05:30.220 --> 05:34.307
I've deceived you.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have.

05:35.183 --> 05:37.727
I was unsure. You see...

05:38.353 --> 05:42.148
...l didn't want you interested in me
just because I owned a pretty face.

05:43.692 --> 05:47.529
So I sent another woman's photograph
and not my own.

05:50.198 --> 05:52.033
I see.

05:52.283 --> 05:55.954
I hope you forgive me.
I meant to write many times. I tried.

05:56.204 --> 05:58.665
But my courage failed me. So l....

06:05.463 --> 06:06.798
And....

06:11.136 --> 06:14.639
Now I stand before you as I am,
and you know the worst.

06:14.973 --> 06:16.141
No, no.

06:17.309 --> 06:18.810
Not the worst at all.

06:20.478 --> 06:23.648
Only, not what I was expecting.

06:24.649 --> 06:27.819
If my deception has altered
your intentions...

06:27.986 --> 06:29.654
...if you're not satisfied--

06:29.696 --> 06:30.989
No, it isn't that.

06:31.031 --> 06:34.326
...l am determined to make my way back
to my home in Delaware.

06:34.409 --> 06:36.745
-If you say so, I will.
-Miss Russell....

06:38.496 --> 06:39.831
Miss Russell...

06:43.501 --> 06:45.295
...you have been honest with me.

06:46.004 --> 06:48.298
I will be honest with you, too.

06:50.300 --> 06:52.719
I will admit to a deception of my own.

06:56.598 --> 06:58.683
You are exactly the image
of your photograph.

06:58.808 --> 07:00.435
Yes, I am.

07:01.269 --> 07:03.938
But I wrote to you that I am a clerk...

07:03.980 --> 07:06.983
...in a coffee export house. I am not.

07:10.195 --> 07:11.655
I own the house.

07:12.447 --> 07:14.115
The business is my own.

07:19.412 --> 07:21.998
You did not want me
to be interested in you...

07:22.082 --> 07:24.834
...just because you owned
a pretty bank account.

07:26.336 --> 07:27.379
Yes.

07:31.049 --> 07:33.218
Then we have something in common.

07:34.636 --> 07:36.805
We are both not to be trusted.

07:41.434 --> 07:46.064
Of course, if my deception
has altered your intentions...

07:48.692 --> 07:52.362
...if you are not interested
in marrying a wealthy man....

07:53.279 --> 07:55.573
No, I think I could manage.

07:58.076 --> 08:00.996
If you could manage
a somewhat prettier wife.

08:03.623 --> 08:05.458
I'll make the effort.

08:20.765 --> 08:22.100
Miss Russell.

08:24.019 --> 08:25.353
Mr. Vargas.

08:26.855 --> 08:30.066
Now we have all the time in the world
to get to know each other.

08:30.900 --> 08:32.861
Well... No, not all the time.

08:35.196 --> 08:37.573
No, we are going to be married at 9:00.

08:39.491 --> 08:41.828
Well then, we'd better hurry.

08:53.673 --> 08:55.175
"Take this ring...

08:56.051 --> 08:57.886
"...as a sign of my love...

08:59.971 --> 09:01.389
"...and fidelity...

09:01.806 --> 09:03.141
"...to you."

09:27.666 --> 09:29.000
Music!

09:29.042 --> 09:30.377
Music!

09:39.511 --> 09:42.013
Ladies and gentlemen, a toast!

09:43.014 --> 09:46.142
To our groom and his beautiful...

09:46.393 --> 09:48.853
...enchanting bride!

09:53.942 --> 09:55.610
Will you dance with me?

09:55.902 --> 09:57.237
Dance?

09:59.197 --> 10:00.740
I don't dance.

10:01.324 --> 10:03.076
I say you do.

10:07.831 --> 10:12.210
May their life together be like this dance,
harmonious, smooth.

10:12.377 --> 10:15.255
Dance for life never ending and--

10:15.338 --> 10:17.215
Alan, enough is enough.

10:17.299 --> 10:18.591
I'm almost through.

10:18.675 --> 10:21.469
You're through now. Sit down.

11:11.811 --> 11:13.480
-Good luck to you.
-Thank you.

11:45.887 --> 11:47.597
Would you like to see the house?

11:47.681 --> 11:50.517
Oh, no. I can see it tomorrow.

11:54.437 --> 11:57.440
You must give me a few moments.
I'm shy of these things.

11:58.608 --> 12:03.196
I will give you as many moments,
days, nights as you need.

12:05.615 --> 12:07.492
When you want me to come to you...

12:08.326 --> 12:09.661
...l will.

12:10.870 --> 12:12.205
Not before.

12:17.585 --> 12:19.087
You would do that for me?

12:21.089 --> 12:22.757
If you say so, yes.

12:29.889 --> 12:31.224
Then...

12:31.933 --> 12:33.768
...l will say good night.

12:39.024 --> 12:40.984
The room is there, to the right.

12:41.943 --> 12:43.945
I think I'll find it.

13:56.977 --> 13:58.812
Awake at last.

14:00.855 --> 14:02.524
The day is half-gone.

14:05.318 --> 14:07.195
I'm sorry. I'm not dressed.

14:07.278 --> 14:10.073
I could wait outside,
but the coffee would get cold.

14:10.407 --> 14:11.825
No, it's all right.

14:12.325 --> 14:15.829
If someone brought me my coffee
every morning before I dressed...

14:15.954 --> 14:17.956
...l would be very happy.

14:18.540 --> 14:20.041
It would change the day.

14:20.125 --> 14:21.251
But...

14:21.960 --> 14:23.920
...you only drink tea.

14:23.962 --> 14:25.630
I do? No.

14:26.423 --> 14:30.260
When I wrote I worked in a coffee
company, you wrote back--

14:30.302 --> 14:31.970
That was my sister.

14:32.804 --> 14:37.309
She believed coffee to be a sinful
pleasure so I pretended to agree.

14:37.392 --> 14:41.604
She read all my letters to you,
so I could not always be truthful.

14:45.358 --> 14:49.362
All the more reason to forget them.
That's all behind you.

14:51.489 --> 14:53.199
What do you think?

14:54.868 --> 14:56.369
About what?

14:59.456 --> 15:01.708
Do you believe as my sister does...

15:02.417 --> 15:05.754
...that pleasure could ever be sinful?

16:04.187 --> 16:06.648
Why did you choose an American wife?

16:08.817 --> 16:11.027
Here, we are the past.

16:12.612 --> 16:14.447
There, you are the future.

16:16.866 --> 16:19.995
Why did you choose to leave it?

16:20.996 --> 16:23.164
To escape the future.

16:25.041 --> 16:27.502
To become someone else, I think.

16:30.714 --> 16:33.508
I am someone else with you.

16:35.885 --> 16:37.554
Someone more like...

16:38.388 --> 16:39.723
...myself.

16:57.991 --> 17:00.160
There, in his arms...

17:00.618 --> 17:02.620
...she became someone else.

17:04.372 --> 17:06.374
Someone more like herself.

19:20.136 --> 19:22.722
I'm telling you, I've never been happier.

19:23.431 --> 19:25.891
There's no such thing as happily married.

19:25.975 --> 19:28.811
It's an oxymoron, like "happily dead".

19:30.396 --> 19:33.983
I thought you'd be finding your way
back to the whores by now.

19:34.066 --> 19:35.901
Seeing a little "Creole" time.

19:35.943 --> 19:37.069
Not anymore.

19:37.194 --> 19:39.530
You've had her for yourself long enough.

19:39.613 --> 19:41.449
When do we get to see her again?

19:41.532 --> 19:43.451
We're going to the theatre next week.

19:43.534 --> 19:45.703
An American touring company
she wants to see.

19:45.745 --> 19:47.038
Why don't you join us?

19:54.920 --> 19:58.883
Soon comes the morning
when the knell is rung...

19:59.258 --> 20:01.427
...to take my living breath.

20:01.510 --> 20:03.763
Come, come, the night is almost done.

20:08.476 --> 20:10.061
Satan is near!

20:10.895 --> 20:12.855
The shrieking, grim and...

20:12.897 --> 20:16.192
...hideous brim of hell to uncover.

20:16.400 --> 20:19.236
Come, or you will share her wretched end.

20:19.570 --> 20:22.239
Hellhound! Abominable monster!

20:22.573 --> 20:24.742
Would that I had never been born!

20:29.580 --> 20:31.248
Wonderful. Wonderful.

20:31.582 --> 20:32.917
Disgusting.

20:33.584 --> 20:35.086
Cheap melodrama.

20:36.712 --> 20:41.342
Was it we who forced our way to you?
Who was it sent her to her ruin?

20:41.717 --> 20:43.010
I...

20:44.261 --> 20:45.596
...or you?

20:46.430 --> 20:49.934
What evil thing has risen from the ground?

20:50.434 --> 20:54.438
Father, let angels now have charge of me...

20:54.689 --> 20:57.525
...encamped around heavenly company.

20:57.858 --> 20:59.694
She is condemned to die.

21:01.112 --> 21:03.698
She is redeemed on high!

21:03.948 --> 21:05.783
Hither, to me!

21:16.961 --> 21:20.131
Julia, my dear, you look flushed.

21:20.715 --> 21:23.718
-Are you all right?
-Yes, it's the theatre.

21:24.010 --> 21:25.344
I love it...

21:25.636 --> 21:27.304
...even the cheap melodrama.

21:30.141 --> 21:31.308
Will you excuse me?

21:37.815 --> 21:39.900
Does she suffer from fevers?

21:40.484 --> 21:43.154
She suffers from a little too much rouge.

21:43.404 --> 21:46.907
Nonsense. A lady does not wear rouge.

21:47.241 --> 21:48.909
No, a lady doesn't.

21:49.243 --> 21:52.913
And a lady does not wander through
the theater alone, either.

21:54.915 --> 21:56.250
Excuse me.

22:00.838 --> 22:04.008
Perhaps you will find the second act
more appealing.

22:57.937 --> 23:00.940
Excuse me, sir!
The public is not allowed backstage.

23:01.023 --> 23:02.983
Don't touch me, sir.

23:03.067 --> 23:04.985
That is my wife, damn it!

23:05.069 --> 23:07.238
Luis, you've come to my rescue...

23:08.155 --> 23:09.490
...just like a play....

23:11.492 --> 23:13.327
What are you doing here?

23:13.494 --> 23:17.456
Isn't it exciting?
Look at all these mysterious contraptions.

23:17.665 --> 23:21.377
-Who was that man?
-What man? I was lost, that's all.

23:21.919 --> 23:23.587
You made my heart stop.

23:23.754 --> 23:26.716
Feel my heart. Feel how fast it's beating?

23:31.679 --> 23:32.680
Christ.

23:33.472 --> 23:35.224
You'll be the death of me.

23:38.853 --> 23:40.521
I hope so.

23:44.233 --> 23:45.693
Places, please.

23:45.860 --> 23:48.320
Ladies and gentlemen, places for act two.

23:56.579 --> 23:58.205
Take me home now.

24:08.883 --> 24:11.052
My own dearest sister.

24:11.218 --> 24:16.432
I can't understand why you treat me thus.
Itis many weeks now since you left.

24:17.016 --> 24:21.145
In all that time, no word from you
to tell me of your safe arrival...

24:21.354 --> 24:25.358
...whetheryou met Mr. Vargas,
whether the marriage has taken place.

24:25.691 --> 24:27.443
What am I to think?

24:27.943 --> 24:30.696
I have contacted the embassy in Havana...

24:30.905 --> 24:33.282
...and the authorities there in Santiago.

24:33.366 --> 24:36.160
I know how you feel about her, but...

24:36.786 --> 24:38.162
...you have to write.

24:40.665 --> 24:43.334
You have to,
before she has the police on us.

24:43.709 --> 24:46.045
You're right. I've been unkind to her.

24:46.504 --> 24:49.674
Although she has never been kind to me.

24:51.592 --> 24:53.636
Just do it.

24:55.179 --> 24:57.431
Do it, and then it's done.

24:57.515 --> 24:59.475
No, no, no!

25:01.852 --> 25:05.147
It's all right. It's me, Luis.

25:06.357 --> 25:07.692
You were dreaming.

25:09.652 --> 25:10.986
Are you all right?

25:15.324 --> 25:17.660
That's it.

25:17.994 --> 25:20.663
You were just dreaming.

25:23.499 --> 25:24.834
It's all right.

25:26.669 --> 25:28.462
It was just a dream.

25:28.796 --> 25:32.091
A bad one, that's all.

25:40.474 --> 25:41.642
It was just a dream.

25:42.018 --> 25:44.228
You okay? You need something?

25:44.311 --> 25:45.271
You.

25:46.105 --> 25:47.440
I'm sorry.

25:47.773 --> 25:49.942
You are here with me. Secure.

25:50.192 --> 25:51.986
You're all right.

25:52.445 --> 25:53.946
Will you stay?

25:54.113 --> 25:55.448
Of course.

25:56.657 --> 25:57.992
Of course.

25:59.785 --> 26:01.454
It's all right.

26:32.943 --> 26:35.071
Luis, don't go.

26:37.406 --> 26:40.076
How is the queen of the house
this morning?

26:44.830 --> 26:47.500
Look. See? I've done it.

26:49.418 --> 26:52.004
This is for the best. Thank you.

26:52.254 --> 26:56.050
-I'll have Sara post it this morning.
-No need. I can do it myself.

26:56.133 --> 26:58.135
I haven't addressed it.

26:58.219 --> 27:02.181
I have the address at the office.
Then it's on its way.

27:10.898 --> 27:12.692
What will you do today?

27:12.775 --> 27:16.112
I'm going to an English dressmaker
at the Plaza Vieja.

27:19.198 --> 27:20.366
You'll need money.

27:22.118 --> 27:24.829
Sign here, Señora.

27:26.455 --> 27:29.750
Is this for both your personal
and business account?

27:29.834 --> 27:31.377
Yes, thank you.

27:31.752 --> 27:34.755
I want my wife to have free use
of all my accounts.

27:35.172 --> 27:36.215
There you are.

27:36.298 --> 27:38.551
Should I sign using my Christian name?

27:39.010 --> 27:40.469
No, your married name.

27:40.761 --> 27:44.181
You must remember to repeat
the signature exactly...

27:44.515 --> 27:46.350
...each time you draw a check.

27:46.726 --> 27:48.394
I will try.

27:59.238 --> 28:00.906
Oh, man!

28:09.874 --> 28:12.251
So, Luis, is it love after all...

28:12.501 --> 28:14.462
...or is it just lust?

28:15.504 --> 28:16.922
Is there a difference?

28:17.214 --> 28:18.424
Oh, yes.

28:18.632 --> 28:22.261
To love someone is to give
and then want to give more.

28:22.887 --> 28:24.430
And lust?

28:24.889 --> 28:26.182
What is lust, Alan?

28:27.016 --> 28:30.144
Lust is to take and then take more.

28:30.478 --> 28:33.272
To devour, to consume.
No logic, no reason.

28:33.647 --> 28:36.484
So...give, take.

28:37.276 --> 28:38.652
Which is it?

28:39.111 --> 28:40.446
Both.

28:43.407 --> 28:45.409
I want to give her everything.

28:46.994 --> 28:49.288
And I want to take everything from her.

28:50.498 --> 28:53.793
Oh, Luis. You are a lost man.

28:54.335 --> 28:55.670
No, no.

28:57.713 --> 28:59.965
She is the one who seems to be lost.

29:00.549 --> 29:04.220
How, why, I don't know.
But that will change.

29:05.471 --> 29:07.306
I can change that.

29:14.188 --> 29:15.272
Mr. Vargas?

29:17.733 --> 29:19.985
Walter Downs.
I didn't mean to startle you.

29:20.277 --> 29:22.905
-That's okay.
-I was told I could find you upstairs.

29:22.947 --> 29:24.490
-How can I help?
-Small matter.

29:24.573 --> 29:27.493
Hardly worth your trouble.
I've been engaged by Miss Russell.

29:27.576 --> 29:28.703
You mean, Julia?

29:29.036 --> 29:31.372
No, Emily. Julia's sister.

29:31.622 --> 29:32.748
In Delaware.

29:32.832 --> 29:34.709
I'm a private investigator.

29:35.126 --> 29:37.003
Just recently arrived from Wilmington.

29:37.503 --> 29:42.091
I understand.
I know Miss Russell was distressed.

29:42.174 --> 29:45.136
But we've written to her several weeks ago.

29:45.553 --> 29:50.057
I'm sure when she receives the letter,
she will be much relieved.

29:50.099 --> 29:52.143
Then Miss Julia is all right?

29:52.518 --> 29:55.646
More than all right.
And more than Miss Julia.

29:56.063 --> 29:57.732
She's Señora Vargas, my wife.

29:57.815 --> 29:59.316
So you are married?

30:02.069 --> 30:04.196
-That's very good news.
-Happily married.

30:04.280 --> 30:05.823
Yes, I can see that.

30:05.906 --> 30:09.076
What a mystery a happy marriage is.

30:09.702 --> 30:12.121
The bloom in the cheek,
the spark in the eye.

30:12.997 --> 30:15.374
-It shows, I guess.
-Yes, indeed.

30:15.416 --> 30:17.626
Miss Russell will be pleased to hear of it.

30:18.252 --> 30:20.212
I'd appreciate if you'd tell her.

30:20.254 --> 30:21.547
I will, indeed.

30:23.257 --> 30:26.927
And I'll be even more convincing
when I've met your wife.

30:30.389 --> 30:31.557
Yes, yes.

30:32.433 --> 30:33.392
Why not?

30:36.520 --> 30:38.606
We will be home Sunday afternoon.

30:39.398 --> 30:41.192
You want to come by for a coffee?

30:41.567 --> 30:42.568
Yes, I will.

30:42.651 --> 30:46.030
And... please convey to your wife
how much I look forward to seeing her.

30:57.792 --> 30:59.960
Outside, please. On the terrace.

31:01.212 --> 31:02.546
Do as she says.

31:06.050 --> 31:07.843
Oh! Just in time.

31:08.678 --> 31:11.847
This is for Sunday paseo,
and this one for weekdays.

31:12.431 --> 31:14.433
Fine, fine.

31:15.601 --> 31:17.186
And the rest?

31:17.395 --> 31:19.271
This one I like.

31:20.022 --> 31:22.942
What do you mean?
There are seven days in a week.

31:24.068 --> 31:26.070
What about your trunk? Is there nothing in there?

31:26.153 --> 31:29.907
Nothing good. Anyway, I've lost the key.

31:29.991 --> 31:33.577
We'll get a locksmith.
It's an easy job. Actually...

31:33.828 --> 31:35.705
...l'll do it myself.

31:37.123 --> 31:39.959
No, I want to show you something. Come here.

31:41.252 --> 31:43.921
You must leave now.
I'm going to kiss my husband.

31:44.005 --> 31:46.507
Then we're going to take a bath.

32:03.566 --> 32:05.234
What do I smell?

32:05.943 --> 32:07.319
My perfume.

32:07.653 --> 32:08.779
No.

32:10.698 --> 32:12.033
A cigar.

32:13.659 --> 32:15.161
I tried one.

32:17.496 --> 32:18.956
One of my cigars?

32:19.790 --> 32:22.126
I wanted the taste of you in my mouth.

32:25.963 --> 32:27.965
You have no shame at all.

32:29.133 --> 32:31.427
Well, there is no shame in loving each other.

32:32.136 --> 32:34.138
Do you love me? Julia?

32:34.805 --> 32:36.474
Do you love me?

32:37.391 --> 32:39.602
Or are you not the loving kind?

33:19.684 --> 33:21.519
I forgot to tell you.

33:23.354 --> 33:25.856
We have a visitor coming on Sunday.

33:27.108 --> 33:28.526
We do?

33:29.568 --> 33:30.820
Yes...

33:30.945 --> 33:33.114
...a genuine private investigator...

33:34.740 --> 33:36.867
...all the way from Delaware.

33:38.494 --> 33:40.830
So, Emily sent him.

33:41.080 --> 33:43.874
Yeah. Detective Downs.

33:44.166 --> 33:46.335
Detective Downs, did you say?

33:46.419 --> 33:49.213
Don't worry,
he only needs to see that you're well...

33:49.922 --> 33:52.591
...and happy and truly my wife.

33:53.718 --> 33:58.055
-Then this nonsense is over.
-When will that damn bird stop screaming?

34:00.182 --> 34:01.350
Julia.

34:07.398 --> 34:10.067
Careful, it's coming.

34:24.373 --> 34:26.042
Oh, no.

34:30.755 --> 34:33.841
Don Luis, look. He's dead.

34:35.176 --> 34:36.635
He was just singing.

34:36.761 --> 34:39.096
He's not singing now, is he?

34:40.389 --> 34:43.141
Looks like he got his little neck broken.

34:44.185 --> 34:48.022
Take him away.
I don't want Julia to see him.

35:40.866 --> 35:43.327
How does a person die on this instrument?

35:45.871 --> 35:47.707
I believe that...

35:49.500 --> 35:52.336
...the turning of the wheel
breaks one's neck.

35:53.504 --> 35:55.172
And if it doesn't?

35:56.257 --> 35:58.092
Does one then strangle?

36:00.136 --> 36:01.387
Are you afraid?

36:04.849 --> 36:05.850
No.

36:06.600 --> 36:08.561
Julia is not afraid.

36:10.563 --> 36:12.023
But Bonny is.

36:13.733 --> 36:17.737
I don't understand. Who is Bonny?

36:22.700 --> 36:24.160
Who is Bonny?

36:26.837 --> 36:28.505
I'm looking for Mr. Vargas.

36:28.631 --> 36:30.924
That is a question
Luis would soon be asking.

36:36.930 --> 36:38.265
Mr. Vargas?

36:39.224 --> 36:40.559
My name is Russell.

36:41.393 --> 36:42.811
Emily Russell.

36:43.103 --> 36:44.938
I am Julia's sister.

36:46.398 --> 36:51.362
So you understand how upset I was
to receive this letter.

36:51.820 --> 36:52.988
Upset?

36:53.280 --> 36:57.451
But... I... I thought you would be pleased
to receive it.

36:58.953 --> 37:00.788
This letter, sir...

37:01.455 --> 37:04.625
...which was written in answer to the one I last sent here...

37:04.959 --> 37:07.294
...and which is signed in her name...

37:07.795 --> 37:09.797
...is not from Julia.

37:11.924 --> 37:14.009
Of course it is.

37:14.635 --> 37:15.844
I mailed it myself.

37:15.970 --> 37:18.013
This letter was not written by my sister.

37:18.055 --> 37:19.515
Miss Russell.

37:24.812 --> 37:27.314
I'm sorry.

37:27.481 --> 37:30.359
Don't be upset. I swear to you--

37:30.401 --> 37:32.569
Swear as much as you like.

37:36.240 --> 37:39.743
That is not Julia's handwriting.

37:40.286 --> 37:42.663
That is the handwriting of a stranger.

37:43.247 --> 37:45.082
A person unknown.

37:46.083 --> 37:47.584
At least to me.

38:16.655 --> 38:19.491
-Where is she?
-I was going to send for you.

38:19.575 --> 38:20.909
Where is she?

38:21.952 --> 38:23.787
Go away, go away. Now get out!

38:34.840 --> 38:36.008
Where did she go, Sara?

38:36.091 --> 38:40.095
I don't know. She sent me to
the post office. When I come back--

39:20.135 --> 39:23.263
She's not coming back, is she, Sara?

39:23.555 --> 39:25.015
She never was here.

39:27.101 --> 39:29.103
You've been married to a dream.

39:30.104 --> 39:32.356
A dream that stole your soul.

39:58.090 --> 40:00.384
Luis! What is it?

40:05.639 --> 40:10.394
Your wife appeared at five minutes to
three for a last-minute withdrawal.

40:10.728 --> 40:15.065
As you instructed,
I gave her full access to your accounts.

40:16.150 --> 40:18.193
Your balance at closing was...

40:18.694 --> 40:21.864
...51 American dollars and 40 cents
in one account...

40:22.031 --> 40:23.866
...ten dollars in the other.

40:29.371 --> 40:32.666
As I explained to your wife,
to help close both out completely...

40:32.708 --> 40:35.377
...your signature
would have been necessary.

40:41.050 --> 40:42.384
I'm sorry.

41:11.705 --> 41:13.040
Don Luis?

41:45.030 --> 41:47.366
God must have been angry with you
that day...

41:47.866 --> 41:50.869
...he let you look in that woman's face.

42:04.300 --> 42:06.969
I want her back. Sara...

42:09.555 --> 42:11.223
...l want her back.

42:14.143 --> 42:17.688
No, cariño. What for?

42:19.315 --> 42:21.775
What for you want her back again?

43:57.403 --> 43:59.572
No, this is not a love story.

44:01.407 --> 44:03.576
But it is a story about love.

44:06.078 --> 44:09.832
about those who give in to it,
and the price they pay.

44:13.377 --> 44:16.589
and those who run away from it
because they are afraid...

44:18.174 --> 44:21.510
...or because they do not believe
they are worthy of it.

44:24.221 --> 44:25.848
She ran away.

44:26.891 --> 44:28.184
He gave in.

44:28.601 --> 44:29.935
Mr. Vargas?

44:31.896 --> 44:33.564
Walter Downs.

44:36.859 --> 44:38.944
What a happy coincidence.

44:40.029 --> 44:41.363
Oh, yeah.

44:42.907 --> 44:44.575
I remember you.

44:50.498 --> 44:54.168
And the authorities here could do nothing?

44:57.338 --> 44:58.964
After all...

45:00.841 --> 45:02.468
...there was no crime.

45:03.844 --> 45:08.682
She was my wife.
She just took what I had given her.

45:11.435 --> 45:12.770
Your money.

45:14.855 --> 45:16.273
And your love.

45:19.068 --> 45:20.820
And you did not suspect?

45:25.950 --> 45:30.788
It seems that I know a lot less
about women than I thought I did.

45:31.789 --> 45:33.040
And I know too much.

45:33.457 --> 45:35.918
Consequently, I've not much use for them...

45:36.293 --> 45:38.254
...apart from the necessities.

45:38.712 --> 45:41.882
For real intercourse,
I prefer the company of men.

45:43.259 --> 45:44.593
Listen to me.

45:46.429 --> 45:48.097
Could you find her?

45:51.976 --> 45:53.269
Perhaps.

45:55.146 --> 45:57.940
But I am, at the moment...

45:58.065 --> 46:02.069
...engaged to find the real Julia,
the one you were meant to marry.

46:04.613 --> 46:06.282
Have you found her?

46:07.450 --> 46:09.452
Have you found her?

46:11.620 --> 46:12.955
Not yet.

46:12.997 --> 46:15.207
If you do... if you do...

46:15.458 --> 46:18.794
...she might lead you to the Julia I married.

46:20.254 --> 46:21.547
Perhaps.

46:22.673 --> 46:24.008
And vice versa.

46:26.886 --> 46:31.140
As much as you want I will pay,
if you can find her for me.

46:31.766 --> 46:33.601
That's all I want.

46:34.185 --> 46:37.188
Then I assume you have made up
your losses.

46:38.230 --> 46:41.066
As much as you want, I will pay, I said it.

46:41.442 --> 46:42.735
I will pay.

46:42.943 --> 46:45.237
Yes, I believe you would.

46:46.113 --> 46:48.073
And if I did find your Julia?

46:48.449 --> 46:50.910
If I brought her to you...

46:51.702 --> 46:53.454
...or you to her...

46:54.872 --> 46:57.541
...what good would it possibly do you?

46:58.250 --> 46:59.293
Money's gone.

47:01.212 --> 47:02.546
The love...

47:03.297 --> 47:04.590
...ruined.

47:06.008 --> 47:08.219
What could you possibly want with her?

47:10.387 --> 47:12.223
What could you possibly want?

47:18.521 --> 47:20.189
I want to kill her.

47:42.136 --> 47:44.596
Yes, I do recall this lady.

47:45.013 --> 47:47.349
Slim and dark and very....

47:48.183 --> 47:52.396
I remember, coming along the deck
and the breeze catching her skirt.

47:52.855 --> 47:54.356
She was coming towards me.

47:54.523 --> 47:59.236
She quickly held it down with her hand
and as she passed, she smiled.

48:00.154 --> 48:03.490
I believe she was traveling
with a troupe of American actors...

48:03.532 --> 48:04.742
...touring the island.

48:04.992 --> 48:07.161
Oh, yes, I remember.

48:07.536 --> 48:10.622
Because she rolled up some lettuce in her napkin.

48:11.373 --> 48:15.461
I thought it was strange.
She explained it was for her bird.

48:15.711 --> 48:17.713
She was traveling with a bird.

48:18.213 --> 48:21.133
Oh, yes. I remember her.

48:21.550 --> 48:24.011
A lady with a birdcage...

48:24.970 --> 48:27.014
...but this doesn't look like her.

48:27.598 --> 48:29.892
She was young and very pretty.

48:31.435 --> 48:32.936
Yes, that's her.

48:34.688 --> 48:37.441
and the real Julia never appears, because...

48:38.150 --> 48:39.318
...she is dead.

48:42.905 --> 48:44.865
-You mean murder.
-Yes.

48:46.450 --> 48:48.660
She could have had an accomplice.

48:48.869 --> 48:51.121
These women often have an accomplice.

48:51.330 --> 48:54.083
Someone she might use and then discard.

48:54.583 --> 48:58.921
Someone who might even now be
in pursuit of her, just as you and I are.

49:01.090 --> 49:02.674
This is where it happened.

49:03.342 --> 49:05.344
Here in Havana.

50:05.904 --> 50:08.198
This way, gentlemen. Welcome to Havana.

50:08.574 --> 50:11.076
Mr. Downs will be in room 37...

50:11.118 --> 50:14.788
...and Mr. Vargas will be just down the hall
in room 42.

50:17.040 --> 50:20.377
I'll hook myself up
with the local authorities...

50:21.170 --> 50:24.173
...and see if any dead bodies
have turned up recently.

50:24.590 --> 50:26.341
You're welcome to join me.

50:28.594 --> 50:30.554
No, thank you.

50:31.555 --> 50:35.851
Havana is a very accommodating city,
especially during Carnival.

50:36.226 --> 50:40.564
I suggest the Opera Restaurant.
It's just across the street.

50:42.733 --> 50:45.235
It's very popular with American tourists.

50:50.657 --> 50:53.702
Why don't you do something
pleasant tonight?

50:54.286 --> 50:58.791
Treat yourself to a good dinner,
a good cigar and a good whore?

50:59.917 --> 51:01.460
I prefer to be alone.

51:08.050 --> 51:10.719
So I'll leave you on your own, then.

52:12.030 --> 52:13.031
Here you are.

52:13.449 --> 52:16.994
Privacy, and a view of the room.
If you see anything...

52:17.327 --> 52:22.666
...or anyone who interests you, let me
know and I'll see what I can arrange.

52:40.434 --> 52:45.147
If I could have my coffee every morning
before I dressed, I would be very happy.

52:45.439 --> 52:47.399
It would change the day.

52:49.234 --> 52:50.903
I would be very happy.

52:50.944 --> 52:52.946
It would change the day.

52:54.323 --> 52:56.366
Then that is what you shall have.

52:56.450 --> 53:00.871
When we are married,
you shall have everything you wish.

53:01.997 --> 53:04.958
Married? Your wife might have
something to say about that.

53:05.584 --> 53:07.461
This way, Colonel, s'il vous plaît.

53:07.836 --> 53:10.339
S'il vous plaît indeed,
you silly mountebank.

53:10.506 --> 53:14.551
-You're about as French as my asshole!
-Edwin, curb your tongue.

53:24.978 --> 53:27.147
May I help you, sir?

53:28.148 --> 53:30.692
I thought I saw an old friend of mine.

53:31.151 --> 53:32.111
Colonel....

53:32.194 --> 53:33.654
-Colonel Worth?
-Yes.

53:33.737 --> 53:35.197
Oh, yes. This way.

53:35.322 --> 53:36.615
No, no, no.

53:37.408 --> 53:39.493
I wouldn't bother him now.

53:40.577 --> 53:42.204
Is he staying at the hotel?

53:42.287 --> 53:46.458
No, he's at home in Havana.
He lives at avenida Medios.

53:46.875 --> 53:49.378
I believe his fiancée is at the hotel.

53:50.754 --> 53:51.755
Fiancée?

53:51.839 --> 53:53.674
Yes, Miss Castle.

53:55.467 --> 53:57.010
Yes, yes.

53:57.761 --> 53:59.930
I see. Thank you.

54:23.370 --> 54:25.956
My dear, I don't have that kind of money.

54:26.039 --> 54:27.624
But, my dear, you do.

54:28.041 --> 54:31.336
Your annual expenditures
are $200,000, more or less.

54:32.629 --> 54:34.131
How do you know that?

54:34.214 --> 54:37.092
Because, under favorable conditions,
you could realize...

54:37.176 --> 54:41.889
...at least 1.5 million pounds of sugar
in good seasons.

54:41.972 --> 54:43.182
Five cents a pound--

54:43.265 --> 54:47.311
No, don't.
Don't make me talk about business now.

54:51.023 --> 54:53.358
I've been waiting for this all night.

55:02.826 --> 55:04.870
Now, don't watch.

55:05.287 --> 55:07.122
Be kind, my dove.

55:07.790 --> 55:09.124
Be kind to an old man.

55:09.166 --> 55:10.876
I am kind.

55:11.043 --> 55:12.795
Kind as I have ever been.

55:22.679 --> 55:24.848
Will you undo my dress, please?

55:25.682 --> 55:27.601
Oh, yes.

55:27.851 --> 55:29.770
Let me have thatpleasure.

55:34.983 --> 55:36.819
That's enough. Thank you.

55:37.277 --> 55:38.570
Thank you...

55:39.488 --> 55:41.532
...for a wonderful evening. Good night.

55:41.615 --> 55:42.866
-No.
-Yes.

55:42.950 --> 55:46.078
I'll behave. I'll only sit and watch you.

55:46.954 --> 55:48.288
You see...

55:48.872 --> 55:50.541
...l sit...

55:51.250 --> 55:52.459
...and I watch.

55:52.626 --> 55:54.795
Is that what you want?

55:56.255 --> 55:59.508
You are very tiresome and I am very tired.

56:00.718 --> 56:02.219
-Good night.
-No.

56:03.429 --> 56:06.598
-No.
-Good night. Yes.

56:06.640 --> 56:07.808
No.

56:08.475 --> 56:11.645
Mayn't I stay? Please, let me stay.

56:16.483 --> 56:18.986
Darling dove, I'm weeping.

56:19.528 --> 56:21.697
My heart is pudding.

56:24.366 --> 56:25.576
I'll go.

56:26.368 --> 56:28.871
But my pudding is all broken.

56:30.581 --> 56:31.790
Good night...

56:32.624 --> 56:34.376
...my little dove.

56:35.627 --> 56:36.962
Good night.

56:38.464 --> 56:40.632
"Parting is such sweet sorrow."

57:30.641 --> 57:32.643
It's only me, Julia.

57:36.397 --> 57:38.732
You haven't forgotten me, have you?

57:44.363 --> 57:45.864
Who's Billy?

57:47.866 --> 57:49.493
Just a fellow.

57:51.703 --> 57:54.331
There must be quite a few
fellows in your life.

57:55.958 --> 57:57.209
Billy...

57:58.168 --> 57:59.378
...me...

58:00.170 --> 58:01.505
...the Colonel.

58:02.464 --> 58:04.133
Did you marry all of them?

58:04.341 --> 58:07.010
-No, just you.
-Liar.

58:08.303 --> 58:09.680
Liar.

58:14.184 --> 58:15.477
Liar.

58:23.318 --> 58:25.195
Well, what is it, then?

58:25.320 --> 58:26.655
What is it?

58:27.656 --> 58:29.199
What are your plans for me?

58:30.033 --> 58:31.410
My plans?

58:32.953 --> 58:35.289
I just came here to kill you.

58:43.672 --> 58:45.174
My God.

58:48.677 --> 58:50.679
All right, do it.

58:58.896 --> 59:01.148
There. There's my heart. Don't hesitate.

59:01.648 --> 59:03.650
Your money's gone. Do it.

59:04.485 --> 59:05.652
Gone.

59:06.862 --> 59:08.614
Like the woman you murdered?

59:11.033 --> 59:12.034
What? No.

59:13.160 --> 59:18.791
You were with her on that boat!
You were seen together!

59:20.667 --> 59:23.712
-I wasn't alone.
-She told you all about me, didn't she?

59:23.962 --> 59:25.089
No!

59:25.756 --> 59:27.257
I told him!

59:27.800 --> 59:32.388
The next day, he told me she'd had
an accident and to take her place. So I did.

59:34.098 --> 59:35.474
Another man?

59:36.016 --> 59:37.351
Accomplice?

59:37.434 --> 59:39.228
Friend? Lover?

59:39.269 --> 59:40.604
An accomplice--

59:42.231 --> 59:45.692
You saw us together,
backstage, at the play.

59:46.819 --> 59:48.904
My friend, my accomplice and...

59:49.363 --> 59:51.740
...yes, yes, my lover.

59:52.199 --> 59:55.536
He was an actor, like myself.
Actors playing parts.

59:57.246 --> 01:00:00.999
I told him that night I didn't want
to go through with it. I couldn't--

01:00:01.834 --> 01:00:03.168
Why not?

01:00:03.419 --> 01:00:04.670
Because!

01:00:05.254 --> 01:00:07.172
Because I was....

01:00:07.506 --> 01:00:09.967
Damn it.
I was falling in love with my own husband.

01:00:10.050 --> 01:00:11.719
Again. Liar.

01:00:14.638 --> 01:00:18.308
I could have bought him off!
I could have kept him away!

01:00:18.559 --> 01:00:21.520
But you made me write her sister
and then it was all over!

01:00:21.812 --> 01:00:22.813
Whore!

01:00:23.230 --> 01:00:24.356
Thief!

01:00:25.941 --> 01:00:28.694
It's how I live. It's all I know.

01:00:28.777 --> 01:00:31.989
I took the money and I gave it to him.

01:00:34.241 --> 01:00:36.243
Then I ran.

01:00:41.999 --> 01:00:43.667
What does it matter?

01:00:43.876 --> 01:00:45.502
What does it matter?

01:00:45.544 --> 01:00:46.879
It's over.

01:00:49.465 --> 01:00:50.883
Whore!

01:00:50.924 --> 01:00:52.468
Liar! Thief!

01:00:52.551 --> 01:00:53.844
Yes!

01:00:54.011 --> 01:00:56.388
Don't you see...

01:00:57.056 --> 01:00:59.683
...that I cannot breathe without you?

01:00:59.767 --> 01:01:01.351
I cannot live without you!

01:01:01.477 --> 01:01:04.229
Don't you see that?
Don't you see how much I love you?

01:01:10.819 --> 01:01:13.030
I'm sorry.

01:01:49.066 --> 01:01:50.734
Where am l?

01:01:54.738 --> 01:01:56.073
Who are you?

01:02:00.119 --> 01:02:01.245
Really.

01:02:02.162 --> 01:02:03.789
My name is Bonny.

01:02:05.124 --> 01:02:06.583
Bonny Castle.

01:02:08.752 --> 01:02:10.254
Bonny Castle.

01:02:14.299 --> 01:02:16.427
Is that your Christian name?

01:02:16.969 --> 01:02:18.345
It would be...

01:02:19.054 --> 01:02:20.681
...if I were Christian.

01:02:21.473 --> 01:02:22.975
But I'm not.

01:02:24.727 --> 01:02:26.478
I was never baptized.

01:02:27.312 --> 01:02:29.022
I was a foundling.

01:02:31.608 --> 01:02:33.068
So was Billy.

01:02:43.954 --> 01:02:46.915
We were raised in an orphanage
outside of St. Louis.

01:02:48.667 --> 01:02:50.377
He gave me my name.

01:02:51.378 --> 01:02:54.298
He saw it on a picture postcard
from Scotland.

01:02:54.798 --> 01:02:59.386
It had a drawing on it,
of a "bonny castle", it said.

01:03:00.929 --> 01:03:04.058
When we were 14, we ran away together.

01:03:05.309 --> 01:03:08.896
Like brother, sister, father, daughter,
husband, wife.

01:03:09.813 --> 01:03:11.690
-He was my salvation.
-No.

01:03:16.445 --> 01:03:18.238
I don't want to know.

01:03:20.157 --> 01:03:21.325
Not now.

01:03:23.952 --> 01:03:27.956
You are Julia Russell
from Wilmington, Delaware.

01:03:30.376 --> 01:03:32.002
You were born...

01:03:32.544 --> 01:03:34.755
...the day you stepped off that boat...

01:03:35.839 --> 01:03:37.716
...and became my wife.

01:03:42.429 --> 01:03:43.972
But then...

01:03:44.056 --> 01:03:46.725
...l am not Julia Russell at all, am l?

01:03:49.770 --> 01:03:51.230
I'm simply your wife.

01:04:44.366 --> 01:04:46.368
-Who is it?
-I don't know.

01:04:46.702 --> 01:04:48.829
It's Edwin, my dear.

01:04:49.288 --> 01:04:51.290
Am I too early?

01:04:52.124 --> 01:04:53.792
Don't hurry.

01:04:54.376 --> 01:04:59.131
Nothing gives me more pleasure than
to wait for you outside your door.

01:05:00.382 --> 01:05:03.635
Unless, of course, you were to let me in.

01:05:18.150 --> 01:05:20.611
-Colonel Worth.
-Good God!

01:05:20.778 --> 01:05:23.614
-May I help you, sir?
-You are not dressed, sir.

01:05:24.239 --> 01:05:25.616
No, I am not.

01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:29.078
I am engaged at the moment
in a private function.

01:05:29.161 --> 01:05:32.581
A function for which clothes
are a hindrance, not a help.

01:05:32.664 --> 01:05:33.832
A private function?

01:05:34.041 --> 01:05:35.042
Yes, sir.

01:05:35.250 --> 01:05:37.628
With Bonny? A private function?

01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:39.588
Good God, man!

01:05:39.797 --> 01:05:42.966
But I am being rude. Please come in.

01:05:43.967 --> 01:05:45.552
No, sir. Are you mad?

01:05:45.636 --> 01:05:47.262
Mad? No.

01:05:48.138 --> 01:05:52.643
I am only curious to know
what your business is at my wife's door.

01:05:56.480 --> 01:05:57.940
Your wife?

01:05:59.191 --> 01:06:00.692
Did you say, "wife"?

01:06:01.151 --> 01:06:03.112
Edwin, be careful.

01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:05.280
He has a fearful temper.

01:06:06.865 --> 01:06:08.909
I beg your pardon, sir. I do.

01:06:09.785 --> 01:06:11.412
I beg your pardon.

01:06:11.954 --> 01:06:13.747
I am an old fool.

01:06:14.289 --> 01:06:15.916
I didn't know.

01:06:18.377 --> 01:06:19.420
I'm sorry.

01:06:26.427 --> 01:06:28.429
Good morning to you, sir.

01:06:29.471 --> 01:06:30.556
Good morning.

01:06:38.897 --> 01:06:40.065
You see?

01:06:41.859 --> 01:06:43.527
You have no past.

01:06:44.778 --> 01:06:47.114
It is gone. Finished.

01:06:47.781 --> 01:06:49.450
Disappeared.

01:06:51.952 --> 01:06:53.829
You have only me now.

01:07:14.725 --> 01:07:17.311
There you are. You weren't in your room.

01:07:18.062 --> 01:07:20.522
I have some very interesting news.

01:07:20.564 --> 01:07:22.066
So do l.

01:07:29.573 --> 01:07:31.241
"A woman's body found."

01:07:31.575 --> 01:07:34.036
"Foul play suspected." How's my Spanish?

01:07:37.247 --> 01:07:38.749
Julia Russell?

01:07:40.209 --> 01:07:43.545
Stabbed in the neck with a small knife,
then thrown overboard.

01:07:43.712 --> 01:07:47.049
Probably the work of a man,
but could've easily been a woman.

01:07:47.257 --> 01:07:50.219
The blade of the knife
was still in her throat.

01:07:52.262 --> 01:07:54.431
And so your wife...

01:07:55.015 --> 01:07:57.393
...is now officially a fugitive.

01:07:57.476 --> 01:08:00.270
Not only are we pursuing her,
but the police, too.

01:08:01.563 --> 01:08:03.565
Cheer up. This is good news.

01:08:03.649 --> 01:08:05.818
It won't be long until she's caught.

01:08:06.860 --> 01:08:07.861
She...

01:08:08.529 --> 01:08:10.197
...didn't do this.

01:08:14.034 --> 01:08:16.203
I believe you still love her.

01:08:20.416 --> 01:08:21.542
Of course.

01:08:21.875 --> 01:08:26.046
How could you hate her so much if you
did not still love her?

01:08:28.465 --> 01:08:31.635
Trust me, my friend.
There's no such thing as love.

01:08:31.844 --> 01:08:34.220
Only misguided feelings and emotions.

01:08:34.555 --> 01:08:37.265
It was my knife. He used my knife.

01:08:38.350 --> 01:08:41.645
-It wasn't me, I promise you.
-I believe you.

01:08:42.145 --> 01:08:44.398
No one else will believe I'm innocent.

01:08:44.481 --> 01:08:45.816
Listen to me.

01:08:45.899 --> 01:08:48.359
No one else matters. Not to me.

01:09:00.456 --> 01:09:02.124
What are you thinking?

01:09:03.375 --> 01:09:04.376
Of you.

01:09:12.468 --> 01:09:14.470
Welcome to Cardenas.

01:09:14.970 --> 01:09:18.932
Right this way. This is the entrance.
It's very elegant...

01:09:19.515 --> 01:09:21.685
...in a very good part of town.

01:09:22.144 --> 01:09:25.731
Mostly Americans and tourists
from the Continent.

01:09:26.648 --> 01:09:30.819
I think you'll find all the furnishings
you need included.

01:09:31.028 --> 01:09:32.654
a bedroom...

01:09:32.946 --> 01:09:35.616
...a sitting room, a very good kitchen.

01:09:39.203 --> 01:09:42.372
Here in Cardenas,
you are close to Havana...

01:09:42.538 --> 01:09:44.707
...but very far away.

01:09:45.376 --> 01:09:50.214
We are known for the waters
and for the healing powers of the sun.

01:10:25.741 --> 01:10:26.909
Vargas.

01:10:28.911 --> 01:10:30.245
What a happy accident.

01:10:30.579 --> 01:10:32.414
Yes, indeed.

01:10:34.124 --> 01:10:36.126
What brings you to Cardenas?

01:10:36.585 --> 01:10:38.712
Not a rest cure, I assure you.

01:10:39.588 --> 01:10:41.548
No, of course not.

01:10:41.924 --> 01:10:45.260
There were reports of a woman
answering a certain description.

01:10:45.594 --> 01:10:47.721
She was seen boarding an eastbound train.

01:10:48.013 --> 01:10:51.391
You haven't seen or heard anything,
have you?

01:10:52.267 --> 01:10:55.228
I've lost my taste for women
of that description.

01:10:55.938 --> 01:10:57.522
Glad to hear of it.

01:11:00.233 --> 01:11:02.069
Listen...

01:11:03.362 --> 01:11:05.030
...can I offer you a piñales?

01:11:05.239 --> 01:11:06.573
What's that?

01:11:07.032 --> 01:11:08.367
A drink.

01:11:10.327 --> 01:11:12.204
There's a cafe down the street.

01:11:16.875 --> 01:11:18.543
The sun is warm.

01:11:19.378 --> 01:11:22.089
Your face, for instance, is quite moist.

01:11:31.390 --> 01:11:35.352
The body was positively identified
by her sister.

01:11:35.727 --> 01:11:38.522
Very sad, but very accurate.

01:11:38.897 --> 01:11:42.025
Two moles high on the inner thigh...

01:11:42.859 --> 01:11:45.070
...and a gold crown on a back tooth.

01:11:45.404 --> 01:11:49.533
And on her left hand, a small, round scar.

01:11:50.367 --> 01:11:51.868
Very interesting.

01:11:54.121 --> 01:11:57.040
Will you excuse me?
I have to use the convenience.

01:11:57.332 --> 01:11:59.001
By all means.

01:12:01.003 --> 01:12:02.671
Do as you must.

01:12:35.495 --> 01:12:36.830
Julia?

01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:42.502
Come upstairs. We....

01:12:44.504 --> 01:12:45.839
Ah, Luis.

01:12:47.299 --> 01:12:48.967
I am disappointed.

01:12:51.678 --> 01:12:54.348
And yet full of admiration.

01:12:58.393 --> 01:12:59.728
Where is she?

01:12:59.811 --> 01:13:01.146
Who? No.

01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:03.231
-She's not here.
-You called her name.

01:13:03.315 --> 01:13:04.942
You have no business here.

01:13:05.317 --> 01:13:08.946
Downs, please. Be smart and leave.
Get out while you can.

01:13:09.321 --> 01:13:10.280
She's mine, Luis.

01:13:10.447 --> 01:13:12.491
Give her up, before it's too late.

01:13:13.158 --> 01:13:15.452
You are aiding a criminal!

01:13:16.036 --> 01:13:19.373
And you are close
to becoming one yourself.

01:13:19.456 --> 01:13:21.124
Come to your senses.

01:13:21.625 --> 01:13:24.628
You saw it. She's not here. Now, please.

01:13:24.962 --> 01:13:27.339
Don't lie to me, Mr. Vargas.

01:13:27.881 --> 01:13:29.716
I can smell her on you.

01:13:29.967 --> 01:13:33.428
Her perfume, stinking on your clothing.

01:13:33.971 --> 01:13:35.847
You just left her, didn't you?

01:13:35.931 --> 01:13:37.891
That's it. Get out.

01:13:40.143 --> 01:13:43.438
Did she throw her arms around you?
Embrace you, like this?

01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:46.817
Did she rub her cheek against yours,
like this?

01:13:47.150 --> 01:13:49.319
Did she kiss you on the mouth?

01:13:49.569 --> 01:13:52.406
If I kiss you now, will I taste her on you?

01:14:07.212 --> 01:14:08.922
You would do this for her?

01:14:10.966 --> 01:14:12.467
Wait!

01:14:12.593 --> 01:14:13.719
Wait.

01:14:14.928 --> 01:14:17.931
Speak of the devil, and she appears.

01:14:25.939 --> 01:14:28.108
My God. What have you done?

01:14:28.442 --> 01:14:30.110
What have you done?

01:14:30.402 --> 01:14:31.737
It's him.

01:14:32.571 --> 01:14:34.406
It's the detective.

01:14:35.949 --> 01:14:37.618
He came here for you.

01:14:46.668 --> 01:14:48.754
What are you doing? Don't touch him.

01:14:48.837 --> 01:14:50.547
Don't touch him!

01:14:58.013 --> 01:15:00.641
-Did he come here alone?
-Yes.

01:15:00.974 --> 01:15:02.643
No one saw him come in?

01:15:04.811 --> 01:15:06.313
I don't know.

01:15:06.647 --> 01:15:08.649
Christ, Julia.

01:15:09.483 --> 01:15:10.901
I've killed a man.

01:15:11.485 --> 01:15:13.737
You need to go to the train station.

01:15:13.987 --> 01:15:17.491
Buy two seats on the morning train east,
no matter where.

01:15:19.493 --> 01:15:23.205
I will contact the estate agent
and tell him we've changed our minds...

01:15:23.372 --> 01:15:25.749
...and there's been an emergency.

01:15:27.709 --> 01:15:29.002
Julia.

01:15:30.879 --> 01:15:32.339
Yes, what?

01:15:34.049 --> 01:15:35.968
I've just killed a man.

01:15:37.844 --> 01:15:39.680
And I just bought a hat.

01:15:43.183 --> 01:15:48.188
But I don't dwell on it. I don't say
over and over, "I just bought a hat."

01:15:48.522 --> 01:15:51.358
"I just bought a hat." It doesn't matter.

01:15:53.026 --> 01:15:55.362
It's done. Help me.

01:15:57.155 --> 01:15:58.323
God.

01:16:10.002 --> 01:16:12.546
-That should do it.
-I'll bring him down.

01:16:13.505 --> 01:16:16.133
No, go to the station
before the window closes.

01:16:17.676 --> 01:16:19.678
Come here. Put these on.

01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:21.013
Yes, I'll hurry.

01:16:21.096 --> 01:16:22.723
No. Don't hurry.

01:16:22.973 --> 01:16:26.393
Go slowly, enjoy the walk
and no one will notice you.

01:16:26.977 --> 01:16:28.770
-Understand?
-Yes.

01:17:03.013 --> 01:17:04.348
Billy.

01:17:05.933 --> 01:17:07.517
You finally got what you deserved.

01:17:21.490 --> 01:17:23.825
-Jesus!
-Aren't you glad to see me?

01:17:23.909 --> 01:17:26.495
Aren't you glad
to see old Detective Downs again?

01:17:26.662 --> 01:17:27.704
Should I be?

01:17:27.955 --> 01:17:31.083
I got very good notices
playing this part in Chicago.

01:17:31.291 --> 01:17:32.709
Or don't you remember?

01:17:32.793 --> 01:17:34.586
Let go of me, Billy.

01:17:34.795 --> 01:17:37.130
You thought I was...

01:17:37.965 --> 01:17:39.633
...really dead...

01:17:41.176 --> 01:17:42.469
...didn't you?

01:17:53.272 --> 01:17:55.857
Did you think
there were real bullets in that gun?

01:17:56.400 --> 01:17:59.736
You think they were real
the night he came to murder you?

01:18:00.904 --> 01:18:05.409
I couldn't risk his putting out your lights,
not before I caught up with you.

01:18:06.577 --> 01:18:08.537
-Let go of me, Billy.
-Never.

01:18:08.745 --> 01:18:11.248
-Not till you come back to the game.
-What game?

01:18:11.331 --> 01:18:13.292
The skin game, darling.

01:18:13.375 --> 01:18:14.710
There is no game.

01:18:14.918 --> 01:18:16.712
Yes. I see it so clearly.

01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:18.589
No, no.

01:18:19.423 --> 01:18:20.924
What do you see?

01:18:23.093 --> 01:18:26.597
I see him running out of money.
I see you arranging that.

01:18:27.055 --> 01:18:29.308
I see him doing the only thing he can do.

01:18:29.391 --> 01:18:33.020
I see him going to Santiago,
selling his share of the company.

01:18:33.103 --> 01:18:35.439
I see him coming back with money.

01:18:35.606 --> 01:18:37.232
I see us...

01:18:37.441 --> 01:18:39.192
...finishing what we started.

01:18:39.776 --> 01:18:41.194
You and me together.

01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:43.989
We're going to make you a rich widow.

01:18:49.953 --> 01:18:53.373
He's worth a hell of a lot more
than we got out of him the first time.

01:18:53.457 --> 01:18:56.919
And he's such an easy mark,
devoted as he is to you.

01:18:57.377 --> 01:19:02.007
Bound together as you are
by mutual crimes and various...

01:19:02.424 --> 01:19:03.926
...misdemeanors.

01:19:04.885 --> 01:19:07.054
-Let go of me.
-Beg.

01:19:07.387 --> 01:19:09.222
-Please, let go!
-Beg.

01:19:12.225 --> 01:19:15.562
It tickles my dick when you beg.

01:19:17.064 --> 01:19:19.566
He says he loves me.

01:19:22.569 --> 01:19:24.404
No one loves you, Bonny.

01:19:24.488 --> 01:19:26.031
No one could.

01:19:26.406 --> 01:19:27.908
Except for me.

01:19:29.743 --> 01:19:31.119
He does.

01:19:31.495 --> 01:19:32.871
I think he does.

01:19:32.996 --> 01:19:35.999
Not enough to live the life of a fugitive.

01:19:37.751 --> 01:19:40.087
Back alleys, cheap hotels....

01:19:40.337 --> 01:19:41.672
It won't be like that.

01:19:41.755 --> 01:19:43.507
How then? Happily ever after?

01:19:44.049 --> 01:19:46.927
A nice, respectable couple,
living on Main Street?

01:19:47.010 --> 01:19:50.097
Sunday dinners,
walks in the park with children?

01:19:51.265 --> 01:19:53.600
Christ, what's he done to you?

01:19:54.309 --> 01:19:56.311
Who do you think you are?

01:19:56.812 --> 01:19:58.855
Who does he think you are?

01:20:00.107 --> 01:20:02.109
You're a whore, Bonny.

01:20:02.359 --> 01:20:05.362
If a man puts his hands on you, you're wet.

01:20:07.364 --> 01:20:09.032
True or not?

01:20:12.995 --> 01:20:14.955
You were born one and you'll die one.

01:20:15.205 --> 01:20:17.874
Sooner than later
if the police catch up with you.

01:20:20.961 --> 01:20:22.629
You wouldn't do that to me.

01:20:22.879 --> 01:20:26.216
I was your first man, Bonny.
Your very first.

01:20:27.050 --> 01:20:28.927
And I will be...

01:20:29.094 --> 01:20:30.596
...your last.

01:20:32.139 --> 01:20:33.932
One way or another.

01:20:36.685 --> 01:20:39.187
There's no future with him, darling.

01:20:40.022 --> 01:20:41.857
Face the truth.

01:20:42.691 --> 01:20:44.860
You can't live his life.

01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:46.820
And he certainly...

01:20:47.237 --> 01:20:48.947
...can't live yours.

01:20:50.532 --> 01:20:52.034
Let him go.

01:20:54.953 --> 01:20:56.121
No.

01:20:56.288 --> 01:20:57.581
Let him go.

01:20:59.291 --> 01:21:00.792
Let him go.

01:21:49.841 --> 01:21:51.510
I was so hungry.

01:21:54.596 --> 01:21:57.849
What about him?
We have to get rid of the body.

01:21:58.767 --> 01:22:00.268
No, it's done.

01:22:01.561 --> 01:22:02.771
It's done?

01:22:05.732 --> 01:22:07.317
You mean you did it yourself?

01:22:08.234 --> 01:22:12.781
I packed all our things, as well.
I left one suit out on the bed, for the train.

01:22:13.615 --> 01:22:15.116
You get the tickets?

01:22:16.076 --> 01:22:18.036
-The tickets? Yes.
-Good.

01:22:18.244 --> 01:22:20.163
We go tomorrow in the morning.

01:22:20.246 --> 01:22:22.373
Back to Havana. 7:00.

01:22:24.876 --> 01:22:26.586
What an adventure.

01:22:29.714 --> 01:22:31.174
Come to bed.

01:22:32.425 --> 01:22:34.302
You must be exhausted.

01:22:34.636 --> 01:22:35.678
I know I am.

01:22:35.762 --> 01:22:38.098
Wait, wait, wait.

01:22:38.765 --> 01:22:41.101
Have you no conscience at all?

01:22:41.601 --> 01:22:42.936
I mean....

01:22:44.270 --> 01:22:45.605
Yes, of course I do.

01:22:45.939 --> 01:22:49.275
But you see,
I don't let it get the best of me.

01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:53.446
It's just something that happened.
It had to be done.

01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:56.866
And when something has to be done,
you do it, right?

01:22:56.950 --> 01:23:01.287
So, here's to us.
A short life, but an exciting one.

01:23:06.209 --> 01:23:07.210
Good night.

01:23:12.382 --> 01:23:14.092
Listen to her talk.

01:23:14.551 --> 01:23:17.554
Listen to the words
that came out of her mouth.

01:23:17.637 --> 01:23:19.097
You mean Bonny?

01:23:19.889 --> 01:23:21.391
Yes, Bonny.

01:23:24.144 --> 01:23:26.604
Did you have no control over her?

01:23:28.314 --> 01:23:30.734
No one had control over her.

01:23:31.484 --> 01:23:32.944
No one did.

01:23:35.905 --> 01:23:38.742
No one, except for Billy.

01:23:40.076 --> 01:23:42.412
and he wanted the rest of the money.

01:23:45.915 --> 01:23:48.918
They found a house
in the poorsection of town.

01:23:49.252 --> 01:23:52.922
Bonny said they would go unnoticed there,
and she was right.

01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:56.843
Many things would go unnoticed
in that house.

01:23:59.262 --> 01:24:01.681
all she had to do
was get Luis to Santiago...

01:24:03.183 --> 01:24:05.310
...and it would all be over.

01:24:11.691 --> 01:24:14.027
No, you don't understand.

01:24:15.361 --> 01:24:18.531
-We've run out?
-Yes, I'll go tomorrow to Santiago.

01:24:18.782 --> 01:24:21.201
I'll take the first train in the morning.

01:24:23.703 --> 01:24:25.413
What will you do there?

01:24:25.538 --> 01:24:27.707
We need money, don't we?

01:24:29.876 --> 01:24:31.711
Whatever you say.

01:24:47.894 --> 01:24:50.313
I don't want you to go to Santiago.

01:24:52.232 --> 01:24:53.316
I have to go.

01:24:53.400 --> 01:24:54.859
I don't want you to go.

01:24:55.235 --> 01:24:56.778
I have no choice.

01:24:57.904 --> 01:24:59.739
You do. You have a choice.

01:25:01.324 --> 01:25:02.700
Once again.

01:25:02.909 --> 01:25:05.537
-When my hand strays to my breast....
-Hearts.

01:25:05.912 --> 01:25:07.789
-My left eardrop.
-Diamonds.

01:25:07.914 --> 01:25:09.707
-My right eardrop.
-Clubs.

01:25:10.083 --> 01:25:11.626
-My throat.
-Spades.

01:25:11.918 --> 01:25:14.504
-Little finger of my left hand.
-One.

01:25:14.671 --> 01:25:16.673
-Little finger of my right hand.
-Ten.

01:25:17.257 --> 01:25:19.551
When I do this,
it means they have nothing.

01:25:19.592 --> 01:25:20.760
Right.

01:25:23.054 --> 01:25:24.806
-King, queen, jack.
-Yes.

01:25:26.266 --> 01:25:27.767
Yes.

01:25:29.519 --> 01:25:30.687
You're a natural.

01:25:31.020 --> 01:25:32.939
-Listen--
-This is the way.

01:25:33.064 --> 01:25:35.066
This is the only way. This is our way.

01:25:35.567 --> 01:25:38.236
This is you and me, together.

01:25:40.405 --> 01:25:41.740
Please.

01:25:45.034 --> 01:25:46.286
Now...

01:25:46.870 --> 01:25:49.664
...tell me what I'm holding.

01:26:03.178 --> 01:26:05.138
Would you like more whiskey?

01:26:07.891 --> 01:26:09.058
Too rich for me.

01:26:11.019 --> 01:26:13.188
Yes. Why not?

01:26:14.355 --> 01:26:17.025
Why not, indeed? All right.

01:26:18.693 --> 01:26:19.986
He wins again.

01:26:20.528 --> 01:26:22.363
I'm sorry, gentlemen.

01:26:22.864 --> 01:26:24.365
More champagne.

01:26:29.370 --> 01:26:31.873
Does the lady mind if I remove my coat?

01:26:32.082 --> 01:26:34.084
No, do and say as you please.

01:26:34.459 --> 01:26:36.795
Try and forget that I am even here.

01:26:37.003 --> 01:26:38.463
Easier said than done.

01:26:43.843 --> 01:26:45.637
Can I get you another drink?

01:27:19.003 --> 01:27:21.589
Will you ask the lady to retire, sir?

01:27:24.426 --> 01:27:25.760
What do you mean?

01:27:25.844 --> 01:27:27.262
Do you have to be told?

01:27:28.471 --> 01:27:31.766
Take your hand from my wife. Please, sir.

01:27:33.184 --> 01:27:34.269
Gladly.

01:27:35.937 --> 01:27:39.274
If there's one thing lower
than a man who cheats at cards...

01:27:39.357 --> 01:27:42.777
...is a man who will use a woman to do
this cheating for him.

01:28:17.145 --> 01:28:18.480
Julia?

01:28:25.820 --> 01:28:27.155
Well, my dear...

01:28:29.324 --> 01:28:32.494
...let's see
what other tricks you might know.

01:29:00.438 --> 01:29:02.190
Are you all right?

01:29:02.607 --> 01:29:03.775
Yes.

01:29:04.776 --> 01:29:05.944
Should l....

01:29:06.611 --> 01:29:08.947
Should I call someone?

01:29:13.284 --> 01:29:14.953
You are so kind.

01:29:17.455 --> 01:29:20.750
You are so young and innocent and kind.

01:29:23.586 --> 01:29:24.796
No.

01:29:25.713 --> 01:29:27.298
No one is innocent.

01:29:33.471 --> 01:29:35.640
You have a story as well.

01:29:37.642 --> 01:29:39.310
Will you tell me...

01:29:40.979 --> 01:29:42.647
...if there's time?

01:29:44.816 --> 01:29:46.776
I have no story.

01:29:48.153 --> 01:29:49.738
Not like yours.

01:29:50.655 --> 01:29:53.283
Well, it was Bonny's story now.

01:29:55.326 --> 01:29:57.162
and look what she had done.

01:30:00.081 --> 01:30:02.292
He could not live in her world.

01:30:02.917 --> 01:30:05.253
and she would never fit into his.

01:30:59.390 --> 01:31:00.809
Dear Alan:

01:31:01.392 --> 01:31:03.061
Congratulations.

01:31:03.645 --> 01:31:08.650
You have just purchased my share
of Vargas-Jordan Coffee Export House.

01:31:09.734 --> 01:31:13.405
The price I have settled on
is everything that was in the safe...

01:31:13.738 --> 01:31:18.076
...which I believe is very much
in your favor. I'm sorry.

01:31:18.410 --> 01:31:19.911
Luis! Wait!

01:31:20.078 --> 01:31:23.164
I'm sorry I couldn't wait
to discuss this with you.

01:31:24.249 --> 01:31:28.211
But as you may know,
I am now a fugitive from justice.

01:31:28.586 --> 01:31:30.922
More than that, I cannotsay.

01:31:31.256 --> 01:31:33.216
What are you talking about?

01:31:33.508 --> 01:31:34.509
Murder.

01:31:36.428 --> 01:31:38.012
I have done murder.

01:31:38.763 --> 01:31:40.390
-No.
-Yes.

01:31:40.765 --> 01:31:42.225
I did it for her.

01:31:43.601 --> 01:31:45.228
And the truth is...

01:31:46.062 --> 01:31:47.689
...that I would do it again.

01:31:51.735 --> 01:31:53.403
Good luck to you.

01:31:53.737 --> 01:31:56.239
Thank you for having once been my friend.

01:31:58.867 --> 01:32:00.201
Go on.

01:32:06.791 --> 01:32:08.168
God help you.

01:34:06.681 --> 01:34:08.349
Will you light me a cigar?

01:34:11.561 --> 01:34:13.479
I'll make us some coffee.

01:34:21.529 --> 01:34:22.780
Damn!

01:34:22.864 --> 01:34:24.824
-What happened?
-There's a rat.

01:34:24.991 --> 01:34:28.036
-A rat?
-There's a rat. It ran right over my foot.

01:34:29.579 --> 01:34:30.913
Do you see it?

01:34:31.622 --> 01:34:32.623
No.

01:34:38.046 --> 01:34:39.839
-I didn't see it.
-No?

01:34:39.881 --> 01:34:41.215
What are you doing?

01:34:41.424 --> 01:34:43.092
Going to the pharmacist.

01:34:43.426 --> 01:34:45.219
-At this hour?
-Yes.

01:34:45.470 --> 01:34:48.640
-It's 9.00. It's closed.
-I know one open till 10:00.

01:34:48.681 --> 01:34:51.351
-What are you doing? Wait.
-I won't be long.

01:36:48.051 --> 01:36:50.928
You can't save him, darling.
If that's what you're thinking.

01:36:51.012 --> 01:36:53.681
Why not? Why can't we just go?

01:36:54.724 --> 01:36:56.893
I have two tickets for us on the train.

01:36:57.435 --> 01:36:59.562
Tonight, midnight. We have the money.

01:37:00.104 --> 01:37:00.855
Leave him.

01:37:00.938 --> 01:37:04.734
Bonny, it doesn't suit you,
this kind of compassion.

01:37:06.277 --> 01:37:10.073
How could I trust you?
There'd always be someone between us.

01:37:10.365 --> 01:37:12.033
Why hurt him?

01:37:12.241 --> 01:37:14.243
He's a part of you that must die.

01:37:14.535 --> 01:37:17.997
You need to kill it,
or I promise you, it will kill you.

01:37:19.248 --> 01:37:21.042
What are you doing? Billy?

01:37:21.084 --> 01:37:24.545
I'm going back with you,
to finish the job and have done with it.

01:37:24.587 --> 01:37:27.924
-You'll have the police all over us.
-Then do as you're told.

01:37:28.007 --> 01:37:29.258
Do it now.

01:37:40.103 --> 01:37:41.729
-Say it.
-Billy--

01:37:41.813 --> 01:37:44.148
Say you're mine. You're mine. Say it.

01:37:44.232 --> 01:37:45.525
Yes, what?

01:37:45.817 --> 01:37:47.652
Yes, I'm yours.

01:38:30.695 --> 01:38:32.322
You startled me.

01:38:33.740 --> 01:38:35.408
You took a long time.

01:38:39.537 --> 01:38:41.331
What are you doing in the dark?

01:38:41.581 --> 01:38:42.915
Thinking.

01:38:43.541 --> 01:38:45.126
What are you thinking?

01:38:47.170 --> 01:38:51.007
I was thinking that if I ever lost you,
my life would be over.

01:38:52.675 --> 01:38:55.011
There would be nothing left for me.

01:38:56.304 --> 01:38:57.972
Except to die.

01:39:01.684 --> 01:39:03.353
Don't say such things.

01:39:05.188 --> 01:39:07.148
Did you find what you were looking for?

01:39:07.190 --> 01:39:08.775
Yes, I did.

01:39:09.484 --> 01:39:11.611
I had to go all the way across town.

01:39:16.324 --> 01:39:18.117
I'm going to go change.

01:39:30.380 --> 01:39:33.800
Wash your hands and go to bed.
I'll bring the coffee.

01:40:01.327 --> 01:40:02.787
There you are.

01:40:18.177 --> 01:40:20.013
How do they die, you think?

01:40:23.683 --> 01:40:25.184
From the poison?

01:40:26.519 --> 01:40:27.854
I don't know.

01:40:32.900 --> 01:40:34.861
Does it take a long time?

01:40:37.613 --> 01:40:40.283
I suppose it depends on
how much you give them.

01:40:40.700 --> 01:40:42.368
That's right.

01:40:45.371 --> 01:40:46.706
Is it painful?

01:40:47.373 --> 01:40:49.792
I really don't want to think about it.

01:40:52.462 --> 01:40:54.297
No, of course not.

01:40:54.756 --> 01:40:59.260
We don't want our conscience
to get the best of us, do we?

01:41:01.554 --> 01:41:04.515
It's something that has to be done.

01:41:05.391 --> 01:41:07.685
And when something has to be done...

01:41:08.728 --> 01:41:10.229
...you do it.

01:41:10.730 --> 01:41:12.357
Is your coffee too hot?

01:41:12.899 --> 01:41:14.233
I saw him.

01:41:17.695 --> 01:41:19.030
Who?

01:41:21.074 --> 01:41:22.575
I followed you.

01:41:23.409 --> 01:41:24.827
You saw who? Where?

01:41:26.079 --> 01:41:27.413
Julia.

01:41:29.082 --> 01:41:31.376
Shall we play the game...

01:41:31.459 --> 01:41:33.753
...or just speak the truth?

01:41:36.756 --> 01:41:38.257
The truth is best.

01:41:38.591 --> 01:41:40.093
All right, then.

01:41:42.220 --> 01:41:43.179
Is he here?

01:41:45.181 --> 01:41:46.349
Yes.

01:41:47.809 --> 01:41:48.977
Where?

01:41:49.686 --> 01:41:52.522
Outside, waiting.
When I turn the lights off.

01:41:53.189 --> 01:41:54.691
When I am dead?

01:41:56.859 --> 01:41:58.027
Yes.

01:42:02.490 --> 01:42:04.701
I led him to you in Havana, didn't l?

01:42:05.827 --> 01:42:06.786
Yes.

01:42:08.204 --> 01:42:10.164
How'd he know I wouldn't kill you?

01:42:12.041 --> 01:42:14.711
He put blank cartridges in your gun.

01:42:24.053 --> 01:42:25.388
Like a play.

01:42:27.223 --> 01:42:28.558
All of it.

01:42:30.893 --> 01:42:32.228
Lies.

01:42:33.563 --> 01:42:35.481
From the moment I met you.

01:42:36.566 --> 01:42:38.401
Not all of it, no.

01:42:38.735 --> 01:42:41.946
Do you laugh at me behind my back,
the two of you?

01:42:44.490 --> 01:42:47.660
Do you laugh at me
for how stupid I have been?

01:42:49.829 --> 01:42:51.164
How blind?

01:42:53.124 --> 01:42:54.334
No.

01:42:55.627 --> 01:42:57.962
Laugh now when I tell you this.

01:42:59.964 --> 01:43:01.299
I loved you, Julia.

01:43:02.091 --> 01:43:04.427
Julia is not here. Julia is dead.

01:43:05.470 --> 01:43:09.641
Laugh when I tell you that I still love you.

01:43:10.224 --> 01:43:11.225
No.

01:43:11.976 --> 01:43:13.436
No, not me.

01:43:13.728 --> 01:43:15.021
You don't love me.

01:43:15.313 --> 01:43:16.648
Yes.

01:43:17.815 --> 01:43:19.651
Yes, you.

01:43:20.985 --> 01:43:23.655
Not Julia Russell. Not...

01:43:24.989 --> 01:43:26.491
...Bonny Castle.

01:43:27.784 --> 01:43:28.743
You.

01:43:30.161 --> 01:43:31.996
I love you as I know you.

01:43:32.580 --> 01:43:34.123
Because I know you.

01:43:36.668 --> 01:43:38.002
As you are.

01:43:40.004 --> 01:43:41.673
Good and bad.

01:43:42.173 --> 01:43:43.925
Better and worse.

01:43:47.428 --> 01:43:50.598
I told you this already,
but you didn't believe me.

01:43:52.850 --> 01:43:54.519
Tonight you will.

01:43:56.771 --> 01:43:58.106
To us.

01:44:00.566 --> 01:44:03.236
A short life and an exciting life.

01:44:03.945 --> 01:44:05.613
Don't do this.

01:44:06.781 --> 01:44:08.366
No other one.

01:44:13.287 --> 01:44:15.456
No other love but you.

01:44:19.961 --> 01:44:21.337
From first to last.

01:44:24.132 --> 01:44:25.717
Start to finish.

01:44:30.013 --> 01:44:32.849
Don't change, Julia. Don't ever change.

01:45:02.086 --> 01:45:03.921
Hold on.

01:45:58.434 --> 01:45:59.769
Let's go.

01:46:53.114 --> 01:46:54.615
You disappoint me, Bonny.

01:46:59.787 --> 01:47:01.372
What do you think?

01:47:01.456 --> 01:47:03.625
Do you think those are real bullets?

01:47:22.769 --> 01:47:24.896
-Do you speak English?
-Yes!

01:47:25.438 --> 01:47:26.814
He needs a doctor.

01:47:26.939 --> 01:47:28.274
What about him?

01:47:40.912 --> 01:47:43.247
He's dead. He needs a doctor.

01:47:43.331 --> 01:47:46.250
All right. I'm calling the police.

01:47:53.675 --> 01:47:56.177
Stay, stay.

01:47:56.260 --> 01:47:59.097
I love you.

01:47:59.597 --> 01:48:02.600
I love you. Do you hear me?

01:48:03.685 --> 01:48:08.606
-Say it. Say it again.
-I love you. I love you.

01:48:08.690 --> 01:48:10.858
I love you, Luis.

01:48:17.240 --> 01:48:19.409
You hold on! Hold on!

01:48:21.369 --> 01:48:23.496
Don't go! Stay!

01:48:23.705 --> 01:48:25.707
Please hold on.

01:48:44.767 --> 01:48:49.605
And this is where the story ends,
at least for me.

01:48:52.108 --> 01:48:54.277
Even though he is alive now...

01:48:54.902 --> 01:48:56.738
...how could I get to him?

01:49:02.577 --> 01:49:04.412
Do you believe in forgiveness?

01:49:06.831 --> 01:49:07.874
Yes.

01:49:07.957 --> 01:49:10.460
And redemption for the human soul?

01:49:19.594 --> 01:49:20.762
Yes.

01:49:21.304 --> 01:49:23.264
Even for someone like me?

01:49:25.767 --> 01:49:26.934
Yes.

01:49:28.227 --> 01:49:29.729
I believe so.

01:49:31.230 --> 01:49:33.941
I will see him in heaven, won't l?

01:49:41.991 --> 01:49:43.284
Yes.

01:49:46.954 --> 01:49:48.790
Will you hand me my shawl, please?

01:49:48.873 --> 01:49:49.916
Yes, of course.

01:49:57.256 --> 01:49:59.592
Now pray with me.

01:50:00.218 --> 01:50:01.219
Yes.

01:50:05.056 --> 01:50:07.725
I wore this on my wedding day.

01:50:09.018 --> 01:50:12.021
But my heart was not in it then.

01:51:03.364 --> 01:51:06.034
I'm sorry, ma'am. It is time.

01:51:17.420 --> 01:51:18.921
If I may?

01:51:22.050 --> 01:51:23.718
What the hell!

01:51:24.010 --> 01:51:26.763
-It's the priest.
-But he left an hour ago.

01:51:26.971 --> 01:51:28.181
I saw him.

01:51:28.765 --> 01:51:31.100
Guards!

01:52:07.553 --> 01:52:12.558
I must say, it is a pleasure to be in such
lovely company for a change.

01:52:12.892 --> 01:52:15.061
The pleasure is all mine.

01:52:15.395 --> 01:52:18.398
Thank you, gentlemen,
for letting me attend.

01:52:23.569 --> 01:52:27.824
And you, sir, may I say, it's a lucky man
who has found such a wife.

01:52:30.910 --> 01:52:32.245
Yes, I am.

01:52:35.581 --> 01:52:38.042
Perhaps, later on...

01:52:38.126 --> 01:52:41.045
...l will tell you the story
of how we came to be here.

01:52:41.754 --> 01:52:45.341
It is an interesting tale.

01:52:46.926 --> 01:52:48.803
Some of it is even true.

01:52:50.513 --> 01:52:52.849
But for now, all I can say...

01:52:53.266 --> 01:52:55.601
...is that from the moment I saw her...

01:52:56.936 --> 01:52:58.313
...l loved her.

01:53:02.191 --> 01:53:04.360
And no matter the price...

01:53:05.028 --> 01:53:07.697
...you cannot walk away from love.

01:53:11.826 --> 01:53:12.952
Four.
