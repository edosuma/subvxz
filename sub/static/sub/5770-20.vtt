COOL VIEW, DANNY.DON'T LOOK AT MY VIEW.
LET'S--

14:38.094 --> 14:39.835
OH. I SEE A BATHROOM.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.097
OH, I HATE THIS.

14:41.141 --> 14:43.708
SO YOU'RE THE, UH--
YOU'RE THE TRAIN GUY.

14:43.752 --> 14:46.929
MY DAD ACTUALLY, UH,
SOLD THE TRAIN BUSINESS.

14:46.973 --> 14:50.977
AND THEN HE INVESTED
ALL THE MONEY IN MINERALS.

14:51.020 --> 14:52.239
SHUT UP.

14:52.282 --> 14:53.980
I AM SO INTO MINERALS!

14:54.023 --> 14:56.069
GOD, NOW I HAVE
MORE QUESTIONS.

14:56.112 --> 14:58.027
THIS PLACE IS AMAZING.

14:58.071 --> 15:00.595
OH, MY GOD.
[laughs]

15:00.638 --> 15:01.944
WHAT? DANNY!

15:01.988 --> 15:04.120
DO YOU HAVE
A DANDRUFF PROBLEM, DANNY?

15:04.164 --> 15:06.035
YES, I DO.
SOMETIMES, I DO.

15:06.079 --> 15:07.776
OKAY, I GET IT.
I'M GROSS.

15:07.819 --> 15:10.997
AND MY DANDRUFF FLAKES,
THEY JUST RAIN SNOW EVERYWHERE.

15:11.040 --> 15:12.389
I'M SWEATY.

15:12.433 --> 15:13.956
I'M REALLY CLOSED OFF AND EVERYBODY HATES ME.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.436
I GET IT.UH, NO.

15:15.479 --> 15:17.307
IT'S FINE.I WAS JUST TEASING YOU
JUST A LITTLE BIT

15:17.351 --> 15:18.830
ABOUT THE DANDRUFF SHAMPOO.

15:18.874 --> 15:20.963
WELL, JUST DON'T
TELL DESLAURIER.

15:21.007 --> 15:22.922
OKAY.

15:22.965 --> 15:25.054
I'M SORRY THAT I LIED TO YOU
ABOUT BRENDAN.

15:25.098 --> 15:26.447
BUT FRANKLY, IT IS
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

15:26.490 --> 15:28.971
FOR YOUR INFORMATION,
THE REASON I DIDN'T TELL YOU

15:29.015 --> 15:32.148
IS BECAUSE HE TREATED ME BADLY
AND I WAS EMBARRASSED.

15:32.192 --> 15:34.934
HE TREATED YOU BADLY?YEAH. HAPPY?

15:34.977 --> 15:36.152
HE'S AN IDIOT
FOR TREATING YOU BADLY.

15:36.196 --> 15:38.024
I MEAN, HE'S AN IDIOT
ANYWAY, BUT--

15:38.067 --> 15:41.027
THANKS. WELL, WHAT ABOUT ADAM?

15:41.070 --> 15:42.158
HE SEEMS LIKE A COOL GUY.

15:42.202 --> 15:44.334
MAYBE.

15:44.378 --> 15:47.033
MAYBE?OH, GOD.

15:47.076 --> 15:48.730
DO YOU USE A WASHCLOTH?

15:48.773 --> 15:49.949
THIS IS DISGUSTING.

15:49.992 --> 15:51.037
THIS IS A BREEDING GROUND
FOR BACTERIA.

15:51.080 --> 15:52.168
OKAY, NO.
I USE ONE SIDE

15:52.212 --> 15:53.996
FOR MY TORSO AND LIMBS
AND THE OTHER SIDE

15:54.040 --> 15:55.215
FOR MY PITS
AND MY FEET.

15:55.258 --> 15:58.653
HOW CAN YOU TELL
WHICH SIDE IS WHICH?

15:58.696 --> 16:01.438
UGH. GROSS.

16:01.482 --> 16:03.092
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU KNOW WHAT'S GROSS

16:03.136 --> 16:05.268
IS YOU LEFT YOUR WINE
IN THE SHOWER.

16:05.312 --> 16:06.487
YOU LOOK THIRSTY.

16:06.530 --> 16:08.141
YOU KEEP PLAYING
YOUR CARDS RIGHT, AUSSIE,

16:08.184 --> 16:10.056
YOU COULD BE
MY LAST CONTINENT.

16:10.099 --> 16:12.667
DANNY IS NOT
RECOGNIZABLE TO ME.

16:12.710 --> 16:14.103
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE DOING TO HIM,

16:14.147 --> 16:16.453
BUT, I MEAN, EVERYONE IS OVER
AT HIS HOUSE AT A PARTY.

16:16.497 --> 16:17.977
I HAVE NEVER SEEN
THAT SIDE OF HIM.

16:18.020 --> 16:22.024
YEAH? I'VE BEEN WORKING
REALLY HARD TO OPEN HIM UP.

16:22.068 --> 16:24.722
YEAH, I THINK HIS EX-WIFE
REALLY DID A NUMBER ON HIM.

16:24.766 --> 16:28.552
WAIT.
UH, DANNY HAS AN EX-WIFE?

16:28.596 --> 16:30.076
YEAH.
YOU KNEW ABOUT THAT.

16:30.119 --> 16:32.730
NO, I DIDN'T.

16:32.774 --> 16:34.036
I WAS WRONG.

16:34.080 --> 16:36.082
HE'S NOT THE ONE
THAT WAS MARRIED.

16:36.125 --> 16:37.735
WHO WAS IT
THAT WAS MARRIED?

16:37.779 --> 16:38.998
PRESIDENT OBAMA
WAS MARRIED.

16:39.041 --> 16:41.304
OKAY.ALEX, ALEX, ALEX, ALEX!

16:41.348 --> 16:42.653
OH, THANK GOD,
THERE YOU ARE.

16:42.697 --> 16:44.133
I REALLY LIKE TALKING
TO ALL THESE PEOPLE.

16:44.177 --> 16:45.700
THEY'RE REALLY NICE.
I JUST WISH I DIDN'T

16:45.743 --> 16:47.136
HAVE TO PRETEND LIKE
I WAS SOMEONE ELSE.

16:47.180 --> 16:48.268
WE DON'T HAVE
TO FIGHT RIGHT NOW

16:48.311 --> 16:49.269
IN THE MIDDLE
OF A PARTY.

16:49.312 --> 16:50.661
I THINK, ADAM,
THAT YOU SHOULD

16:50.705 --> 16:52.315
MAYBE PLAY SOME MUSIC
RIGHT NOW.

16:52.359 --> 16:54.317
THAT I CAN DO.
MAYBE AN ORIGINAL?

16:54.361 --> 16:55.753
EXCUSE ME, MINDY.NO!

16:55.797 --> 16:58.017
ADAM, GREAT IDEA.
JUST PLAY SOME MUSIC.

16:58.060 --> 17:00.323
EVERYBODY,
I HAVE FANTASTIC NEWS.

17:00.367 --> 17:02.717
ADAM IS GOING TO PLAY
AN ORIGINAL COMPOSITION.

17:02.760 --> 17:05.067
SO STOP TALKING
OR FIGHTING

17:05.111 --> 17:07.374
OR WHATEVER YOU'RE DOING,
AND JUST COME OVER AND LISTEN.

17:07.417 --> 17:08.375

18:12.134 --> 18:13.309
PSYCH!

18:13.353 --> 18:15.268

HE WAS A PROSTITUTE?

19:03.229 --> 19:07.320
NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT. NO.
YESTERDAY.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.242
HOW WAS THE SEX?

19:16.285 --> 19:17.373
OKAY, I REFUSE
TO ANSWER QUESTIONS

19:17.417 --> 19:18.374
FROM PEOPLE THAT
I DON'T KNOW PERSONALLY.

19:18.418 --> 19:20.028
I'M SORRY.FINE, I'LL ASK HER THEN.

19:20.071 --> 19:21.116
HOW WAS THE SEX?

19:21.160 --> 19:22.248
I DIDN'T HAVE SEX
WITH HIM!

YOU'RE ABOUT TO LEAVE?ARE YOU SMOKING?

19:48.926 --> 19:50.363
YEAH, I'M SMOKING.

19:50.406 --> 19:51.494
AT LEAST THERE'S
ONE OR TWO THINGS

19:51.538 --> 19:52.626
YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT ME.

19:52.669 --> 19:53.670
YOU SHOULD KNOW BETTER.

19:53.714 --> 19:54.976
YOU'RE POISONING YOURSELF.

19:55.019 --> 19:57.500
ARE YOU REALLY GIVING ME
LIFE ADVICE RIGHT NOW?

19:57.544 --> 19:59.502
SERIOUSLY?OKAY, FAIR ENOUGH.

19:59.546 --> 20:00.547
SO ALEX AND I
BROKE UP TONIGHT,

20:00.590 --> 20:01.722
IN CASE YOU DIDN'T KNOW.

20:01.765 --> 20:03.245
YOU DECIDED TO TELL HER
ABOUT MY EX-WIFE

20:03.289 --> 20:04.507
IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE PARTY.

20:04.551 --> 20:06.683
WHY DID YOU DO THAT?
THAT WAS REALLY STUPID.

20:06.727 --> 20:08.772
I AM SORRY
TO HEAR THAT...YEAH, OKAY.

20:08.816 --> 20:10.165
BUT I THINK IT IS CRAZY

20:10.209 --> 20:11.732
THAT YOU WOULD NOT TELL HER
ABOUT YOUR EX-WIFE.

20:11.775 --> 20:13.690
[chuckles]WHAT?
WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

20:13.734 --> 20:15.301
YOU'RE UNBELIEVABLE TO ME.

20:15.344 --> 20:17.607
YOU BROUGHT A PROSTITUTE
TO MY PARTY, WHICH YOU RUINED,

20:17.651 --> 20:18.826
AND YOU STILL
HAVE THE CONFIDENCE

20:18.869 --> 20:20.567
TO STAND THERE
WITH YOUR HAND ON YOUR HIP

20:20.610 --> 20:21.872
AND TELL ME WHAT'S WRONG
WITH MY LIFE?

20:21.916 --> 20:23.613
I'M SORRY, MINDY.
THAT'S JUST FUNNY TO ME.

20:23.657 --> 20:24.571
I WAS JUST TRYING TO BE
A GOOD FRIEND.

20:24.614 --> 20:26.486
I DIDN'T ASK
TO BE YOUR FRIEND.

20:26.529 --> 20:30.403
[Parker]
AHEM. UH, DR. C?

20:30.446 --> 20:31.969
[Danny] PARKER, WHAT IS IT?SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

20:32.013 --> 20:34.145
ONE OF THE AUSTRALIANS
MAY HAVE SET A SMALL FIRE

20:34.189 --> 20:36.626
INSIDE YOUR PIANO.

20:39.238 --> 20:41.196
ARE YOU MAD BECAUSE

20:41.240 --> 20:43.111
YOU LOOKED LIKE A FOOL
AT THE PARTY?

20:43.154 --> 20:44.808
DID I REALLY LOOK THAT BAD?YOU LOOKED--IT WAS BAD.
IT WAS A BAD ONE.

20:44.852 --> 20:46.245
WHY WOULD I THINK
IT WAS A GOOD IDEA

20:46.288 --> 20:48.638
TO PRETTY WOMAN
SOME MALE PROSTITUTE?

20:48.682 --> 20:51.337
YOU ALWAYS TAKE CHANCES
ON PEOPLE WHO NO ONE ELSE WILL.

20:51.380 --> 20:53.121
LIKE, ME--
SUPER GOOD-LOOKING GUY,

20:53.164 --> 20:55.906
VERY STRONG,
BUT KIND OF A DIRTBAG.

20:55.950 --> 20:58.909
AND NOW,
I OWN MY OWN LAPTOP.

20:58.953 --> 21:00.737
IT'S THE BIGGEST LAPTOP
YOU'VE EVER SEEN.

21:00.781 --> 21:02.739
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT DANNY TOLD ME?

21:02.783 --> 21:06.090
HE SAYS THAT I ONLY GO OUT
WITH GUYS WHO ARE DICKS.

21:06.134 --> 21:07.744
[chuckles]AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

21:07.788 --> 21:08.876
I THINK HE'S RIGHT.

21:08.919 --> 21:11.095
AH. HE WOULD KNOW.WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

21:11.139 --> 21:12.880
WELL, I CAN ONLY SAY THIS
BECAUSE DR. CASTELLANO

21:12.923 --> 21:14.185
IS, LIKE,
MY BEST FRIEND.

21:14.229 --> 21:16.318
BUT HE'S A RICH DOCTOR
WITH A TON OF FRIENDS,

21:16.362 --> 21:18.581
AND HE SHOULD
MAYBE SMILE FOR ONCE.

21:18.625 --> 21:22.193
INSTEAD, HE'S LIKE,
"UH, EVERYONE KEEP IT DOWN.

21:22.237 --> 21:23.804
I'M TRYING TO READ
THE SPORTS SECTION."

21:23.847 --> 21:25.893
"UH, WORKS STARTS
AT 9:00.

21:25.936 --> 21:28.852
NOT 9:01. NOT 9:02."

21:28.896 --> 21:31.899
"THERE'S TWO FLAVORS FOR COFFEE:
CREAM AND SUGAR."

21:31.942 --> 21:34.684
[both groaning mockingly]

21:34.728 --> 21:36.686
GO TO BED.
