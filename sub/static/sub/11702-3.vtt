00:18.235 --> 00:19.675
Thanks for dropping me
in the shit with Ferguson.

00:19.755 --> 00:21.075
Well, you were a bit heavy-handed, Fletch.

00:21.155 --> 00:22.155
She was armed with a shiv.

00:22.235 --> 00:23.395
Yeah, well, she was going to drop it.

for smack like a bloodhound.

in here for the conversation.

We've completed the search.

07:12.475 --> 07:15.315
Found the usual, cash, mags,
smokes, but no spray can.

07:15.395 --> 07:16.835
Anderson's here to see you, as requested.

07:16.915 --> 07:18.515
Yep. Oh, just a moment.

07:25.155 --> 07:27.115

written report has been made

07:34.395 --> 07:36.075
concerning your breach
of conduct the other day.

07:36.235 --> 07:39.235
- What breach?
- Inappropriate use of capsicum spray.

07:39.315 --> 07:40.355
What?

07:40.435 --> 07:42.515
I'd have preferred to ignore
it, but now that it's in writing,

07:42.595 --> 07:44.595
it will have to be lodged
with the governing body.

07:45.155 --> 07:47.195
It's, uh, it's unfortunate.

07:50.395 --> 07:51.515
So who wrote this report?

07:51.595 --> 07:52.915
You know I'm not at liberty to say,

07:52.995 --> 07:55.755
but you're well within your rights to
speak to the governing body yourself.

07:55.835 --> 07:57.355
Well, I think I know who.

07:57.435 --> 07:59.595
I'll let you know if I hear
anything further on the matter.

07:59.675 --> 08:00.915
Just send in Anderson.

08:09.915 --> 08:11.995
Don't bother sitting. This'll be brief.

08:13.075 --> 08:15.675
Were you in the exercise yard this morning?

08:15.755 --> 08:17.395
- Uh, yeah.
- Good.

08:17.475 --> 08:18.795
So you saw what happened?

08:21.395 --> 08:23.315
That government property was vandalized.

08:23.395 --> 08:24.395
- Yes?
- Yeah.

08:24.475 --> 08:26.155
Good. I need to know who it was.

08:27.315 --> 08:28.315
I don't know.

08:28.395 --> 08:30.235
I think we just established that you do.

08:30.315 --> 08:31.555
Yeah, but I didn't see...

08:31.635 --> 08:33.755
I gave you the garden
project as a privilege,

08:33.835 --> 08:36.315
with the understanding that
good behavior would be rewarded.

08:36.395 --> 08:38.275
If you're not going to work with
me, Anderson, I'm very sorry,

08:38.355 --> 08:40.315
I'll be forced to reconsider
those garden privileges.

08:40.395 --> 08:41.794
So I'm going to ask you again.

08:41.875 --> 08:44.755
Who was responsible for
the graffiti in the yard?

08:52.275 --> 08:54.235
I will give you 24 hours

08:55.955 --> 09:00.075

14:26.755 --> 14:28.755
- Fuck!
- I'm sorry, Franky. My cue slipped.

14:28.835 --> 14:30.515
VERA: Ah, Slater, you're off the table.

14:30.595 --> 14:32.235
SIMMO: What? It was an
accident, Ms. Bennett.

14:32.315 --> 14:34.555
I don't care. Back to your unit, now. Go.

14:35.115 --> 14:36.475
VERA: You two, go.

14:37.795 --> 14:38.955
I'm so sorry.

14:44.435 --> 14:45.475
(SLAPPING)

14:45.555 --> 14:47.315
- Hey.
- Where's the spray can?

14:47.395 --> 14:48.515
Huh?

14:48.875 --> 14:50.075
Where's the spray can?

14:50.515 --> 14:51.835
They're gonna...

14:56.075 --> 14:57.155
Here.

14:59.275 --> 15:00.435
- You're pinned.
- Nah.

15:00.755 --> 15:04.155
I'm just tired, hey.

15:05.155 --> 15:06.915
Bullshit. Where'd you get
it? Did you get it off Simmo?

15:07.595 --> 15:09.555
- Huh?
- Was it Simmo?

15:09.635 --> 15:10.675
- Yeah.
- Oh, fuck.

15:10.755 --> 15:12.795
- Yeah, it was just a little bit.
- Okay.

15:14.395 --> 15:15.475
FRANKY: Booms. Get in here.

15:15.555 --> 15:18.155
Nah, Franky please. Nah,
I won't go to her again.

15:18.235 --> 15:20.715
- Close the door.
- No, don't hurt me.

15:21.035 --> 15:24.155
Oh, fuck, please, Franky!

15:24.635 --> 15:26.275
Say cheese, dickhead.

15:39.195 --> 15:40.555
Oi, Simmo.

15:49.075 --> 15:50.075
What happened to you?

15:51.035 --> 15:53.155
Franky pinged me on the bloody gear.

15:53.235 --> 15:54.875
I told you to be careful,
ya silly little mole!

15:54.955 --> 15:56.475
Nah, listen.

15:57.715 --> 15:59.755
I know how you can get that bitch, eh.

16:00.395 --> 16:03.395
She always studies in the
Ed Center, after dinner.

16:04.115 --> 16:05.235
Alone.

16:05.315 --> 16:07.835
No Boomer, huh?

16:09.555 --> 16:10.555
Whatever.

16:13.515 --> 16:14.515
Uh-huh.

16:51.635 --> 16:54.475
Don't do this, Simmo. You can't
trust Sky. You know she's with Franky.

16:54.555 --> 16:57.275
She's a junkie. She's anybody's,
as long as they've got the gear.

16:57.355 --> 16:58.675
And I'm the only one with access.

16:58.955 --> 17:00.035
LINDA: Smith!

17:00.515 --> 17:02.955
What are you doing? Job's not
finished. There's a whole section here.

17:23.395 --> 17:25.155
I believe this is yours, Ms. Jago.

17:30.435 --> 17:32.035
You can come with me now.

17:37.955 --> 17:39.035
SIMMO: Roz!

17:40.115 --> 17:41.115
Megan?

17:42.275 --> 17:43.275
Simmo.

17:45.595 --> 17:47.515
You've come to join my
study group, have ya?

17:50.355 --> 17:51.355
Hi.

17:51.435 --> 17:52.955
- You set me up.
- Yeah.

17:53.035 --> 17:54.035
(LAUGHS)

18:02.515 --> 18:03.515
(GRUNTS)

18:06.795 --> 18:07.795
(GROANS)

18:09.235 --> 18:10.715
Get her between the shelves.

18:24.315 --> 18:25.755
You seem to like eight balls, Simmo.

18:25.835 --> 18:27.195
BOOMER: Yeah.

18:28.235 --> 18:29.715
You up for a game now?

18:31.155 --> 18:32.595
(PANTING)

18:33.075 --> 18:34.915
OFFICER: (OVER PA) Attention
compound, attention compound.

18:35.155 --> 18:36.875
All prisoners return to their units.

18:36.955 --> 18:39.075
The count will commence in 15 minutes.

18:39.515 --> 18:41.315
- Come on, we gotta go.
- FRANKY: Booms?

18:42.075 --> 18:44.195
- Yeah?
- I want you to finish the job.

18:46.675 --> 18:48.035
- What?
- Kneecap her.

18:48.315 --> 18:49.995
They'll put her in
protection. She won't be back.

18:50.075 --> 18:51.315
She won't be a pain in the arse.

18:52.155 --> 18:53.155
No.

18:53.475 --> 18:56.315
No. She... Well, look,
she... She's almost out cold.

18:57.075 --> 18:58.955
It'd be a bit dirty.

18:59.435 --> 19:01.595
I don't care, Boomer.
I'm not fuckin' around.

19:01.675 --> 19:02.675
I want her out of here permanently.

19:06.115 --> 19:07.315
I want you to use this.

19:10.395 --> 19:11.515
Oh, fuck.

19:13.635 --> 19:14.635
That's hardcore.

19:14.715 --> 19:15.995
Just do it quick.

19:16.075 --> 19:17.555
Get back before the count, hey?

19:38.155 --> 19:39.875
- BEA: Where's Simmo?
- MEGAN: Piss off.

19:41.075 --> 19:43.675
You'd better tell me because
I think she's been set up.

19:46.875 --> 19:48.595
- WILL: Whoa!
- BEA: Sorry, Mr. Jackson.

19:49.355 --> 19:50.755
Where are you going?
Didn't you hear the call?

19:51.435 --> 19:52.955
Yeah, I was just off to get Simmo.

19:53.235 --> 19:54.875
Okay, you stay here. I'll
get her. Where is she?

19:55.435 --> 19:56.835
She's, um, she's in the shower block.

19:57.115 --> 19:58.155
Yeah, it's...

19:59.595 --> 20:00.635
It's a girl thing.

20:00.715 --> 20:01.755
Okay.

20:02.315 --> 20:04.435
You've got five minutes. Run.

20:08.675 --> 20:09.795
(BOOMER GRUNTS)

20:11.635 --> 20:13.155
Boomer, Boomer! Don't do it, Boomer!

20:13.235 --> 20:14.275
BOOMER: Oh, fuck! Shit!

20:14.515 --> 20:17.395
You scared me.

20:18.355 --> 20:19.355
She's had enough.

20:19.435 --> 20:21.315
Oh, piss off. She deserves it, all right?

20:21.395 --> 20:22.395
Boomer...

20:23.275 --> 20:24.515
You don't believe that.

20:24.915 --> 20:27.115
You don't have to do everything
that Franky tells you, all right?

20:27.195 --> 20:28.195
Yeah, I do.

20:28.275 --> 20:30.715
You just tell her that Mr.
Jackson came and you had to run.

20:30.795 --> 20:32.755
All right? You just tell her anything.

20:32.915 --> 20:34.075
Just don't do this.

20:34.155 --> 20:35.515
OFFICER: (OVER PA) Count
commencing in five minutes.

20:35.595 --> 20:37.355
You can still make the call if you go now.

20:41.155 --> 20:42.155
Yeah?

20:46.275 --> 20:47.275
Oh, shit.

20:50.555 --> 20:52.875
- Simmo. It's me.
- (SIMMO MUMBLING)

20:55.835 --> 20:56.955
Let's get you up.

21:01.675 --> 21:02.915
(SIMMO GROANING)

21:04.835 --> 21:06.995
OFFICER: (OVER PA) Sierra
Four, call in your count please.

21:08.755 --> 21:10.035
Sierra Four, reporting please.

21:10.115 --> 21:11.155
Oi!

21:12.395 --> 21:13.675
Is your radio down?

21:16.515 --> 21:18.155
- Where the hell is everyone?
- Look.

21:18.315 --> 21:20.635
- Will!
- Just give me one minute, please.

21:20.715 --> 21:21.755
What the fuck!

21:21.835 --> 21:23.515
Just give me one minute.
Don't call it in yet.

21:23.595 --> 21:25.395
Have you lost your head? You've
gotta raise the alarm, mate.

21:28.075 --> 21:29.155
Will!

21:29.995 --> 21:30.995
Will!

21:39.955 --> 21:41.275
Jesus Christ.

21:45.275 --> 21:47.195
- WILL: What happened?
- BEA: I just found her like this.

21:49.115 --> 21:50.715
OFFICER: (OVER PA) Sierra
Five, will you please confirm.

21:50.795 --> 21:52.675
Do you have an eyeball on Sierra Four?

21:53.115 --> 21:55.475
Sierra Five, do you have
an eyeball on Sierra Four?

22:02.155 --> 22:03.315
What's going on?

22:04.755 --> 22:06.595
Where are the prisoners from this unit?

22:07.515 --> 22:09.435
Flet... Mr. Fletcher?

22:12.435 --> 22:13.635
I don't know.

22:15.795 --> 22:17.275
OFFICER: (OVER PA) Sierra
Three, we have a code black.

22:17.355 --> 22:20.595
I repeat, a Code Black. I'm
escorting Slater to medical.

22:27.435 --> 22:29.635
This is your last chance
to tell me something

22:29.715 --> 22:31.475
that vaguely resembles the truth.

22:31.555 --> 22:33.195
I told you, I didn't see who hit me.

22:35.515 --> 22:38.715
You told Mr. Jackson that Slater was
sick, which leads me to believe that,

22:38.795 --> 22:40.635
at the very least, you
knew an attack was imminent.

22:40.715 --> 22:42.835
No, no. No, Simmo said
she was feeling unwell,

22:42.915 --> 22:44.355
so I went to get her from the shower block.

22:44.795 --> 22:45.795
Mr. Jackson.

22:46.795 --> 22:48.275
Take Smith back to H4.

22:49.795 --> 22:51.515
You and I will speak later.

23:13.685 --> 23:15.685
- What's going on?
- Franky is starving me.

23:15.765 --> 23:17.285
She won't let me eat, thanks to you.

23:17.965 --> 23:19.805
- Oh, punishment?
- Yeah.

23:20.245 --> 23:21.365
Oh, sorry.

23:21.845 --> 23:23.205
Don't tell her you were there.

23:23.725 --> 23:25.125
- Don't worry.
- Don't.

23:25.325 --> 23:26.325
Don't.

23:36.005 --> 23:37.765
I heard you got in the shit, Red.

23:40.885 --> 23:43.205
It's not like you to miss a
count, ya little straighty.

23:46.645 --> 23:50.285
You know, if I were to somehow
find out that you helped Simmo,

23:50.645 --> 23:52.525
that'd be very bad for you.

23:52.965 --> 23:54.645
You've got nothing to worry about.

24:09.325 --> 24:10.485
FERGUSON: It is simply not acceptable.

24:13.165 --> 24:15.885
I was brought here to
stop the cycle of failure.

24:17.325 --> 24:19.205
But I can only do that if everyone steps up

24:19.285 --> 24:21.405
and takes responsibility for their actions.

24:22.605 --> 24:25.045
When officers ignore the
protocols put in place,

24:26.045 --> 24:29.565
when certain inmates expect
preferential treatment from guards,

24:29.645 --> 24:31.325
- the whole system falls...
- Governor, Mr. Fletcher...

24:31.405 --> 24:33.245
This is not a Q and A, Mr. Jackson.

24:34.285 --> 24:36.365
I will say this just once more to you all.

24:37.125 --> 24:39.525
Join with me in fixing Wentworth,

24:41.125 --> 24:42.885
behave with professionalism...

24:44.765 --> 24:45.765
or get out.

24:46.645 --> 24:47.645
That is all.

24:50.085 --> 24:51.405
FERGUSON: Mr. Fletcher?

24:53.285 --> 24:54.285
A moment.

24:57.125 --> 24:58.245
How're you doing?

24:59.765 --> 25:01.765
I'm fine, thanks.

25:03.045 --> 25:04.045
Why do you ask?

25:05.005 --> 25:06.045
Professionally...

25:06.685 --> 25:08.845
How would you rate your performance?

25:09.605 --> 25:10.925
I'm doing my job.

25:11.725 --> 25:12.965
I would have to disagree.

25:14.245 --> 25:17.165
In fact, I am rapidly running
out of patience with you.

25:17.245 --> 25:18.245
Me?

25:19.045 --> 25:20.325
What for?

25:20.565 --> 25:23.925
Further breaches of conduct
could result in your dismissal.

25:24.405 --> 25:25.485
Do you understand?

25:30.565 --> 25:31.965
Consider this a final warning.

25:33.325 --> 25:34.765
LIZ: Come on, Roz. It's a big dick.

25:34.845 --> 25:36.885
It's gonna take you a long
time to cover it up. Come on.

25:39.525 --> 25:40.645
You're off the hook.

25:40.725 --> 25:41.725
Yeah.

25:43.325 --> 25:46.125
Thanks, Franky. Really
appreciate it, Franky.

25:49.885 --> 25:50.965
I'm glad the garden's safe.

25:51.045 --> 25:54.685
But I'm not going to thank you for
putting an innocent person in the slot.

25:55.005 --> 25:56.405
- An innocent person?
- Yeah.

25:56.485 --> 25:57.765
Do we even have any of those?

25:58.725 --> 26:00.685
- Whatever.
- Not whatever.

26:01.285 --> 26:03.325
I did you a favor and now it's your turn.

26:03.405 --> 26:05.285
I want in on the garden detail today.

26:05.365 --> 26:06.605
I can't. The detail's full.

26:07.485 --> 26:08.485
Then get rid of someone.

26:09.245 --> 26:10.245
All right.

26:15.845 --> 26:16.965
Fletch, look.

26:17.245 --> 26:19.605
I'm sorry about what
happened. I didn't mean to.

26:20.485 --> 26:23.685
Are we talking about reporting me
for the capsicum spray incident,

26:23.765 --> 26:26.645
or allowing prisoners to leave the
muster and letting me taking the blame?

26:26.725 --> 26:28.445
Look, I didn't mean for you
to take the blame for that.

26:29.365 --> 26:32.125
Sorry, again I'm confused here.
Which one are we talking about?

26:32.205 --> 26:34.285
Look, Ferguson asked
me to write that report.

26:34.365 --> 26:37.005
Oh, so you just did it,
like a good little boy?

26:37.085 --> 26:38.165
You didn't question her motivation?

26:38.245 --> 26:39.685
Look, I just wrote down what happened.

26:39.765 --> 26:41.965
She's trying to get rid of me
and she's using you to do it.

26:42.045 --> 26:43.445
You know, that sounds really paranoid.

26:43.525 --> 26:44.605
Mate, if you've got a problem with me,

26:44.685 --> 26:46.925
why don't you man up and
say that to my face, huh?

26:47.005 --> 26:49.165
What're you talking about? Why
would I have a problem with you?

26:51.245 --> 26:52.245
Just forget it.

27:14.205 --> 27:15.245
LIZ: Oh, those mini-cucumbers.

27:17.125 --> 27:18.725
DOR: Can't wait for them to turn out.

27:19.485 --> 27:20.725
Yeah, they're gonna be lovely.

27:21.605 --> 27:23.205
They're gonna look great
when you put them in.

27:23.285 --> 27:24.845
INMATE: They're gonna be pink. (LAUGHING)

27:35.845 --> 27:37.885
- When do you want the gear?
- Soon as possible.

27:38.525 --> 27:39.565
- Tomorrow?
- Yeah, okay.

27:40.805 --> 27:42.005
Hey, we need a drop box.

27:42.085 --> 27:44.645
Somewhere in the shed where I can put
the cash and you can leave the gear.

27:44.925 --> 27:46.925
I was thinking under one
of the floorboards, yeah?

27:47.405 --> 27:49.125
- It's gotta be safe.
- Yeah, I can fix it.

27:54.485 --> 27:56.645
- STEVEN: Who're you talking to?
- BATES: Just myself, sir.

28:04.605 --> 28:07.645
Ah, Ms. Miles, can I go and get the hose?

28:08.125 --> 28:09.325
We're right here, love.

28:10.165 --> 28:11.205
Go on.

28:11.285 --> 28:13.045
- FRANKY: Come, Booms.
- BOOMER: What?

28:21.805 --> 28:22.805
What are you doing?

28:24.205 --> 28:26.085
I brought some food for the bird.

28:26.165 --> 28:27.165
Oh.

28:27.485 --> 28:29.445
I thought you would have
been over here looking for me.

28:31.805 --> 28:32.965
Not a chance.

28:34.365 --> 28:35.765
LINDA: Hurry up, Anderson.

29:24.405 --> 29:25.485
Hey.

29:26.365 --> 29:27.645
Are you okay?

29:29.085 --> 29:30.245
Do you mind?

29:30.325 --> 29:31.365
No.

29:32.445 --> 29:33.445
Here, sit down.

29:41.445 --> 29:43.085
You saved my arse last night.

29:44.005 --> 29:46.045
- Thanks.
- Don't mention it.

29:48.405 --> 29:49.405
To anyone.

29:49.685 --> 29:50.885
Does Franky know?

29:51.365 --> 29:53.005
She has her suspicions, yeah.

29:53.725 --> 29:56.165
- I guess we're both fucked then.
- Possibly.

29:57.725 --> 29:59.965
I owe you. I won't forget it.

30:04.165 --> 30:05.325
Hey, Simmo...

30:06.805 --> 30:08.245
There's something you could do for me.

30:16.925 --> 30:18.485
Can you please give this letter to Brayden?

30:18.965 --> 30:20.525
It's to say how sorry I am.

30:21.965 --> 30:23.885
You can read it. I've left it unsealed.

30:24.485 --> 30:26.085
They won't let me post
anything to him and...

30:27.645 --> 30:30.005
Well, then I thought that when
he visits, you could maybe...

30:30.485 --> 30:32.085
I don't think you owe him anything.

30:32.325 --> 30:33.405
What do you mean? I took his mother's...

30:33.485 --> 30:34.925
You don't need to do this.

30:35.005 --> 30:36.605
You don't need to feel guilty.

30:37.645 --> 30:39.125
You're serving your time.

30:41.725 --> 30:42.885
I, uh...

30:44.605 --> 30:47.965
It would just put my mind at rest.

30:56.165 --> 30:57.165
Sure.

30:58.645 --> 30:59.645
Thanks.

31:04.005 --> 31:05.445
He's coming in tomorrow.

31:07.645 --> 31:08.845
Thanks.

31:30.130 --> 31:31.130
BEA: Hey.

31:32.610 --> 31:34.690
- What brings you here, Red?
- Have you got a sec?

31:35.290 --> 31:36.410
I might.

31:36.490 --> 31:37.770
You know the law, right?

31:38.370 --> 31:40.370
Yeah, wish I'd studied it before my trial.

31:41.330 --> 31:42.410
Why?

31:43.530 --> 31:46.370
Do you think I have a chance at
an appeal? To reduce my sentence?

31:46.450 --> 31:48.730
- What'd you get? Twelve years?
- Mmm-hmm.

31:49.050 --> 31:50.410
- Plea bargain?
- Mmm-hmm.

31:50.570 --> 31:51.770
Probably not.

31:52.210 --> 31:53.810
Sounds about right to me.

31:53.890 --> 31:56.170
But if I wanted to give it
a shot, where do I start?

31:57.250 --> 32:01.690
You can start by telling me
where you were during the count.

32:05.010 --> 32:06.410
I was in the shower block.

32:07.130 --> 32:08.370
I didn't hear the call.

32:08.450 --> 32:09.450
How come?

32:09.970 --> 32:11.250
Because I was washing my hair.

32:11.330 --> 32:12.450
(LAUGHS)

32:12.810 --> 32:13.930
There's a lot of it.

32:16.530 --> 32:18.050
I hope that's the case.

32:24.250 --> 32:25.250

32:25.570 --> 32:26.570
Mmm.

Wild orchid.

32:28.290 --> 32:29.770
Ooh, that's hot.

32:32.170 --> 32:34.090
You can, uh, ask your lawyer

32:34.170 --> 32:36.450
what mitigating factors
they can present in appeal.

32:36.850 --> 32:37.850
Okay.

32:37.930 --> 32:39.130
Mitigating factors.

32:39.210 --> 32:41.810
Yeah, you might be able to
squeeze a few months off, maybe.

32:41.890 --> 32:42.890
Is that all?

32:43.290 --> 32:45.610
You did stab someone
in the neck with a pen.

32:46.970 --> 32:47.970
Yeah.

32:48.930 --> 32:50.170
Okay, thanks.

32:54.810 --> 32:56.170
And whatever you think,

32:57.010 --> 32:59.250
I'm not siding with Simmo against you.

33:05.170 --> 33:06.290
- (KNOCKS ON DOOR)
- Mr. Jackson?

33:06.370 --> 33:07.890
I've got a visitor's request form.

33:08.570 --> 33:09.570
Put it there.

33:09.930 --> 33:12.250
It's urgent. It's my lawyer.
I need him to come tomorrow.

33:12.330 --> 33:14.050
- Well, that won't happen.
- Why not?

33:15.530 --> 33:16.970
Do you see that pile there?

33:17.850 --> 33:19.730
I'm working from the bottom up, Bea.

33:20.570 --> 33:22.290
Well, is there any chance that maybe...

33:22.370 --> 33:24.370
No, there is absolutely no chance.

33:25.330 --> 33:27.370
'Cause last time I did you
a favor, you shat on me.

33:27.450 --> 33:28.890
I didn't mean to get you into trouble.

33:28.970 --> 33:30.330
But you did lie to me.

33:32.330 --> 33:33.570
Slater wasn't sick.

33:36.610 --> 33:39.370
So why put yourself on the line
for her? See, I don't understand.

33:40.050 --> 33:41.810
Well, I didn't know that
that's what was going to happen.

33:41.890 --> 33:43.570
You're still lying to me, Bea.

33:44.250 --> 33:45.930
I know there's more to it than that.

33:49.170 --> 33:51.290
I couldn't let another
person get hurt, all right?

33:53.490 --> 33:54.570
I'm really sorry.

33:59.730 --> 34:00.730
I'll put it through.

34:02.410 --> 34:03.410
Thank you.

34:05.730 --> 34:08.730
Whatever it is, Bea, I hope you're
not playing a dangerous game.

34:09.290 --> 34:10.370
No.

how to get things done.

35:28.290 --> 35:30.730
- Oh.
- Yeah, I don't see her anymore, but.

35:31.410 --> 35:32.410
What happened?

35:33.610 --> 35:36.410
(SIGHS) Her mum, she
dumped me when I got busted.

35:37.370 --> 35:39.210
Still think about her every day, but.

35:44.250 --> 35:45.370
I'm sorry.

- Yeah.

No, no, no, it's the other
way round. I want 'em here.

35:56.370 --> 35:58.250
And make sure the table legs are raised,

35:58.330 --> 35:59.770

36:45.530 --> 36:47.690
Yeah, ten o'clock at
Cranny. Any minute now.

36:58.810 --> 37:01.490
You've developed a sudden
interest in gardening, Doyle.

37:02.170 --> 37:04.490
It's the veggies, Ms.
Ferguson. I just love 'em.

37:05.090 --> 37:07.330
You know, home grown, nice and fresh.

37:09.490 --> 37:11.210

eating your vegetables in the slot.

about? We agreed on a price.

that or it's no deal.

not quite sure why I'm here.

40:14.667 --> 40:17.467
I guess I really came because
it's a favor to you, Bea.

40:19.707 --> 40:22.147
Now, I've been over your old case notes

40:22.547 --> 40:26.787
and I'm afraid I think we've
exhausted avenues of appeal...

40:27.667 --> 40:28.947
(INAUDIBLE)

40:45.267 --> 40:47.787
and that amounted to a
reduction of 18 months.

40:47.867 --> 40:51.827
And there was also, of course, a
reduction to extenuating circumstances,

40:51.907 --> 40:54.747
namely, the death of your daughter

40:54.827 --> 41:00.507
and, of course, the deceased's

done all I can for you.
