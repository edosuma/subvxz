And what did our horoscope
say this morning, Rolly,

01:51.290 --> 01:54.040
that it's a good day
to be rude?!

01:54.040 --> 01:57.250
Shh! Hear that magic sound?

01:58.330 --> 02:01.790
Sweet, nourishing kibble!

02:06.460 --> 02:07.540
Whoa!

02:16.000 --> 02:17.830
What is this?

02:19.790 --> 02:23.120
Possibly your head
after I get done with it.

02:24.250 --> 02:27.830
This kibble has
a harsh cedar aftertaste.

02:27.830 --> 02:31.290
Hey, where is the gravy?

02:32.420 --> 02:34.540
Stop eating!

02:34.540 --> 02:38.170
Our Krunchies have been defiled!

02:38.170 --> 02:39.920
Come on, Rolly!

02:39.920 --> 02:42.380
Let's just eat.
We wanna go
to Grutely Days.

02:42.380 --> 02:46.080
dogs: Yeah, come on!
Yeah, come on!

02:46.080 --> 02:48.580
No, no, no, don't you see?

02:48.580 --> 02:50.790
They've changed the recipe.

02:50.790 --> 02:55.000
It's the difference between
Van Gogh and paint-by-numbers.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.000
Look what I found. Ehh!

02:58.000 --> 02:59.120
Huh?

03:04.460 --> 03:07.580
Wide, skinny,
wide, wide, skinny,

03:07.580 --> 03:10.380
wide, skinny, wide, wide,
skinny, skinny, wide, skinny.

03:10.380 --> 03:14.710
Hey! The barcode says these were
manufactured in Grutely.

03:14.710 --> 03:17.080
Wait a minute.

03:17.080 --> 03:20.620
There's never been
a factory in Grutely.

03:20.620 --> 03:23.750
They opened up the new
Kanine Krunchies plant

03:23.750 --> 03:25.750
without me knowing about it?

03:25.750 --> 03:28.120
They, uh, have to
clear things with you?

03:28.120 --> 03:32.330
I think we need to make
a trip to Grutely.

03:50.170 --> 03:51.790
That's weird.

03:51.790 --> 03:55.000
Why would they have
a wood chipper
in a dog food plant?

03:56.080 --> 03:58.710
That's why the kibble
tastes like wood!

03:58.710 --> 04:01.080
They're using sawdust
as filler.

04:01.080 --> 04:02.580
Rolly: And they're replacing

04:02.580 --> 04:06.670
the rich, tasty gravy powder
with chalk!

04:06.670 --> 04:09.880
Who could be responsible
for such atrocities?

04:09.880 --> 04:11.960
Cruella: You're fired!

04:11.960 --> 04:15.290
Why do we bother to ask?

04:18.210 --> 04:20.620
As the new owner
of Kanine Krunchies,

04:20.620 --> 04:22.420
I guarantee that I will
get this company

04:22.420 --> 04:25.170
out of the financial doghouse.

04:25.170 --> 04:30.080
And I'll start by changing
the name to Cruella Crunchies!

04:30.080 --> 04:34.250
We should have known Cruella was
behind this kibble conspiracy.

04:34.250 --> 04:35.920
Next we're going to improve

04:35.920 --> 04:38.000
the public image
of Cruella Crunchies

04:38.000 --> 04:41.960
by sponsoring
Grutely Days Picnic.

04:41.960 --> 04:45.040
Plus, our new theme song,
which I wrote,

04:45.040 --> 04:46.880
will soon drone through
the heads

04:46.880 --> 04:50.080
of every man, woman,
and child on earth.

05:14.880 --> 05:18.250
And finally,
we're going to cut costs.

05:19.500 --> 05:21.290
Memo to myself.

05:21.290 --> 05:23.670
Replace sawdust in the dog food
with dirt.

05:23.670 --> 05:25.000
It's even cheaper.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.210
man: But, Miss De Vil, aren't
you concerned about nutrition?

05:28.210 --> 05:31.080
Oh, who cares?
They're dogs!

05:31.080 --> 05:33.330
And their owners
are too stupid
to know the difference.

05:34.710 --> 05:36.880
Now, let's get over
to Grutely Days

05:36.880 --> 05:39.710
and make Cruella Crunchies
a household word.

05:39.710 --> 05:42.170
It's about image, people, image!

05:59.880 --> 06:03.000
I always try
to be supportive, but...

06:03.000 --> 06:05.710
get off me now!

06:05.710 --> 06:07.750
Now we got evidence!

06:07.750 --> 06:10.000
Yeah, but what can
we do with it?

06:10.000 --> 06:12.830
We'll blow the lid off
Cruella's whole scam.

06:12.830 --> 06:15.040
If we can get this tape
to Roger and Anita,

06:15.040 --> 06:16.540
they'll play it
for the authorities.

06:16.540 --> 06:18.330
B-b-but they're
with everybody else,

06:18.330 --> 06:20.920
at Grutely Days!

06:20.920 --> 06:23.880
(band playing,
children laughing)

06:31.420 --> 06:34.290
Remember to buy
Cruella Crunchies
for your dog.

06:34.290 --> 06:36.960
And if you don't
have a dog,
get one free

06:36.960 --> 06:39.210
with the purchase
of five bags
of Crunchies.

06:42.540 --> 06:44.170
What?

06:44.170 --> 06:45.750
Horace! Jasper!

06:45.750 --> 06:49.380
Those filthy mongrels have
somehow gotten my tape recorder.

06:49.380 --> 06:51.000
Get it back!

06:54.540 --> 06:56.830
Any sign of Roger
and Anita?

06:56.830 --> 06:57.830
Not yet.

06:57.830 --> 06:59.920
Uh-oh.
We've got company.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.460
Rolly: They're after us!
Run!

07:07.960 --> 07:12.000
Oh! Give me my recorder,
you overstuffed annoyance!

07:17.670 --> 07:19.750
crowd: Hey!

07:21.830 --> 07:22.880
Jasper: Hmm.

07:22.880 --> 07:24.080
Huh?!

07:33.330 --> 07:35.880
Yaaaah!

08:09.420 --> 08:10.710
Uh-oh!

08:30.460 --> 08:34.290
both: Nooooo!

08:34.290 --> 08:35.960
Wahoo!

08:35.960 --> 08:37.330
Whooo!

08:42.120 --> 08:43.330
Whoa!

08:46.670 --> 08:49.290
Whoaaaaa!

08:53.830 --> 08:55.750
We got it, we got it!

08:55.750 --> 08:57.830
We outsmarted
the puppy.

08:57.830 --> 09:02.460
As Mayor, I'd like to welcome
everyone to Grutely Days,

09:02.460 --> 09:05.330
sponsored this year
by the new, improved,

09:05.330 --> 09:08.290
and renamed Cruella Crunchies.

09:11.420 --> 09:12.830
Miss De Vil!

09:12.830 --> 09:14.420
Hey!

09:14.420 --> 09:17.790
Hey, look!
Horace got Cruella's recorder.

09:17.790 --> 09:20.620
Mayor: ...Cruella Crunchies,
whose unwavering...

09:22.000 --> 09:24.670
What took you buffoons so long?

09:24.670 --> 09:26.670
Don't answer that.

09:26.670 --> 09:29.580
Just get over to the sound booth
and cue up the new jingle!

09:29.580 --> 09:32.580
I'm proud to present her
to you...

09:32.580 --> 09:34.580
Cruella De Vil!

09:39.380 --> 09:42.540
Thank you,
faceless consumer horde.

09:42.540 --> 09:44.040
I mean people.

09:44.040 --> 09:48.000
Without that recorder,
we'll never be able
to prove anything.

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
Cruella's crunchy injustice
will go on forever.

09:53.790 --> 09:56.670
I guess it's a good thing Horace
didn't get the tape, too.

09:58.620 --> 10:00.080
all: Yeah!

10:00.080 --> 10:03.420
To start things off, I'd like
to musically delight you

10:03.420 --> 10:06.380
with my new Crunchies jingle.

10:11.790 --> 10:13.420
Cruella: Memo to myself.

10:13.420 --> 10:15.790
Replace sawdust in the dog food
with dirt.

10:15.790 --> 10:16.790
It's even cheaper!

10:16.790 --> 10:19.290
Turn that off!

10:19.290 --> 10:22.540
man: But, Miss De Vil,
aren't you concerned
about the nutrition?

10:22.540 --> 10:24.710
Cruella: Who cares?
They're dogs!

10:24.710 --> 10:27.080
And their owners are too stupid
to know the difference.

10:27.080 --> 10:29.620
Let's everybody sing "Kumbaya."

10:29.620 --> 10:31.580
All together, now!

10:31.580 --> 10:33.080
Oh-oh-ohhhh!

10:36.080 --> 10:38.790
Ahh! That's not my voice.

10:38.790 --> 10:42.750
That's some other
unfeeling monster!

10:49.460 --> 10:51.040
Help me!

10:51.040 --> 10:53.960
I'm basting!

10:58.040 --> 11:00.620
Hey, the paper says
Kanine Krunchies

11:00.620 --> 11:02.380
is going back
to its old recipe.

11:02.380 --> 11:04.670
If only puppies
everywhere knew

11:04.670 --> 11:07.330
that you were the hero
behind this, Rolly.

11:07.330 --> 11:09.710
Oh, tut-tut,
young chicken.

11:09.710 --> 11:12.250
If I can bring a smile
to their hearts

11:12.250 --> 11:13.540
and a belch to their lips,

11:13.540 --> 11:16.000
my work is done.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.670
Come to papa!

11:24.580 --> 11:27.210
Meaty, yet spicy.

11:27.210 --> 11:29.880
Reminiscent of the Krunchies
of last summer.

11:29.880 --> 11:34.500
Now, that, that
was an excellent vintage.

11:44.540 --> 11:47.620
(puppies panting,
Spot squawking)

11:47.620 --> 11:49.670
Lucky: Come on, guys,
we're getting close!

11:56.880 --> 11:59.170
Aw, that
kibble-stealing squirrel

11:59.170 --> 12:01.290
definitely came through here.

12:05.330 --> 12:08.080
Uh-huh! I smell squirrel!

12:08.080 --> 12:09.670
Oh, yeah, that-a-way!

12:11.460 --> 12:14.670
Uh, Spot, that's
where we came from.

12:14.670 --> 12:16.420
The squirrel's
over there.

12:16.420 --> 12:18.380
I... knew that.

12:18.380 --> 12:20.170
Listen! Do you hear that?

12:20.170 --> 12:22.500
Hear what?

12:22.500 --> 12:24.040
I hear...

12:24.040 --> 12:26.580
Oh, yeah, I hear it.

12:26.580 --> 12:28.750
Stampeding wild turkey?

12:28.750 --> 12:31.540
Ooh, close,
but wrong species.

12:31.540 --> 12:32.920
It's...

12:32.920 --> 12:34.750
all: Squirrel feet!

12:34.750 --> 12:38.500
I, uh, was just
testing you guys.

12:38.500 --> 12:39.540
Huh?

12:41.170 --> 12:43.580
Hey, guys, they're over...

12:43.580 --> 12:45.880
Oh, never mind.

12:48.830 --> 12:51.960
I got you now,
you, you squirrel, you!

12:53.540 --> 12:55.330
Furry little animal!

12:55.330 --> 12:57.790
Where are you?

12:59.040 --> 13:02.500
Nobody calls
Manny the Mole
a squirrel

13:02.500 --> 13:04.210
and gets away with it.

13:04.210 --> 13:07.500
(Manny throwing punches,
Spot squawking)

13:14.500 --> 13:19.210
I just experienced a new level
of humiliation.

13:19.210 --> 13:22.330
Look, we found
the kibble.

13:22.330 --> 13:25.580
Rolly's unerring nose
came through again.

13:25.580 --> 13:28.420
Not to mention
my superb hearing.

13:28.420 --> 13:31.620
Yeah, you're dogs.

13:31.620 --> 13:34.750
You got great hearing
and great smelling.

13:34.750 --> 13:36.420
I got a bent beak.

13:38.920 --> 13:40.460
Oh, what's the use?

13:40.460 --> 13:43.580
I'm just
a worthless chicken.

13:43.580 --> 13:47.000
Life would be so much better
if only I were a dog

13:47.000 --> 13:50.250
instead of a klutzy cluck.

13:53.250 --> 13:56.500
What luck!
A four-leaf-clover!

13:56.500 --> 13:58.250
This means I get a wish.

13:58.250 --> 14:00.710
What an amazing coincidence.

14:00.710 --> 14:02.960
Clover, clover, in my claws,

14:02.960 --> 14:05.540
swap these wings
for spotted paws.

14:05.540 --> 14:08.080
Hear my wish
for naturalization,

14:08.080 --> 14:10.380
let me join
the Dalmatian nation!

14:21.540 --> 14:22.710
Aaaah!

14:28.460 --> 14:31.750
This is the last time
I buy used.

14:31.750 --> 14:33.960
Hey, kiddo, come outta hiding!

14:33.960 --> 14:37.290
I am Drumstick,
your Fairy God-Chicken.

14:37.290 --> 14:39.000
Fairy God

14:39.000 --> 14:41.790
In person.
I'm here to
grant your wish.

14:41.790 --> 14:43.330
Really? You mean...

14:43.330 --> 14:47.210
Yep! Poof!
You are now a carnation.

14:47.210 --> 14:49.790
I said Dalmatian!

14:49.790 --> 14:51.670
My mistake.
Let me try again.

14:51.670 --> 14:54.420
Not vegetation,
not graduation,

14:54.420 --> 14:56.920
not equation...

14:58.170 --> 15:01.290
not a giant crustacean!
Whaa!

15:01.290 --> 15:04.500
Is it too soon
for me to say "ouch"?

15:05.580 --> 15:08.500
I said a Dalmatian!

15:08.500 --> 15:11.460
OK, you asked for it,
you got it!

15:14.380 --> 15:17.710
Spot: Hey, I don't really feel
any different.

15:17.710 --> 15:20.540
But...

15:20.540 --> 15:23.750
Oh, wow, I'm a dog!

15:23.750 --> 15:25.380
I'm really a dog!

15:25.380 --> 15:29.040
My dream,
it's finally come true!

15:29.040 --> 15:31.420
Oh, I'm so...

15:31.420 --> 15:32.420
Whoa!

15:36.080 --> 15:38.960
Uhh!

15:38.960 --> 15:42.960
Boy, this four-legged thing
is hard to steer.

15:43.960 --> 15:46.380
Hey, what's that smell?

15:46.380 --> 15:49.670
All I smell is wet dog.
Pretty it isn't.

15:49.670 --> 15:52.420
No, I mean...

15:52.420 --> 15:55.000
Nanny's muffins!

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
Wow! I can smell 'em
all the way from here.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.040
What a nose!

16:00.040 --> 16:04.170
Ow! Hey!
What's that loud pounding noise?

16:04.170 --> 16:06.330
Fairy God-Chicken:
That is a cricket's heartbeat.

16:06.330 --> 16:08.380
Dog ears,
they're, oh, top!

16:11.460 --> 16:14.330
Hoo-hoo! The smells,
the sounds.

16:14.330 --> 16:16.670
This is better than
I ever imagined.

16:16.670 --> 16:21.330
And grass never tasted
so good!

16:21.330 --> 16:24.420
Oooh-aaaah!

16:24.420 --> 16:26.380
Hey, hey, hey, what's going on?

16:26.380 --> 16:29.750
I'm having some
sort of butt quake!

16:29.750 --> 16:32.080
That's your tail,
get used to it.

16:32.080 --> 16:34.580
Well, have fun being a puppy.

16:34.580 --> 16:36.210
Wait a minute, that's it?

16:36.210 --> 16:39.250
Aren't you gonna give me
any doggie instructions?

16:39.250 --> 16:42.420
Yeah, just don't fall asleep
in the driveway.

16:45.330 --> 16:47.420
Thanks, Fairy God-Chicken.

16:47.420 --> 16:51.000
Oh, boy, I can't wait
to show everybody!

16:55.790 --> 16:58.420
Spot: Look, guys!

16:58.420 --> 16:59.960
Aaah!

16:59.960 --> 17:01.670
I'm a dog! Yeah!

17:01.670 --> 17:04.250
Uh-huh.
And your point is?

17:04.250 --> 17:06.210
It's me, Spot!

17:06.210 --> 17:07.920
Yeah, right.

17:07.920 --> 17:10.040
And I'm
Thunderbolt.

17:10.040 --> 17:12.170
No, really.

17:12.170 --> 17:15.290
I just got changed
into a dog!

17:15.290 --> 17:18.250
You know, there is
something familiar
about her.

17:18.250 --> 17:19.880
I'll prove it to you.

17:19.880 --> 17:22.250
I'll tell you something
only Spot would know.

17:22.250 --> 17:26.080
Like, uh, where Rolly keeps
his secret stash of fritters.

17:26.080 --> 17:28.670
Big deal,
everybody
knows that.

17:28.670 --> 17:30.380
They do?

17:30.380 --> 17:33.380
What about the time Mooch put
pink dye in Lucky's flea bath

17:33.380 --> 17:35.380
and he came out looking
like bubble gum?

17:35.380 --> 17:37.670
Hey, I wasn't that pink!

17:37.670 --> 17:39.880
Or when Rolly wanted
to impress Dumpling

17:39.880 --> 17:43.330
and dressed up like
a Vegas lounge singer.

17:43.330 --> 17:46.120
Well, one crisis
at a time, pal.

17:46.120 --> 17:48.790
I'm still reeling
from this fritter thing.

17:48.790 --> 17:51.540
And Cadpig blew up
the farm's freezer
in order to --

17:51.540 --> 17:55.330
Thank you for sharing.
We're convinced.

17:55.330 --> 17:59.120
Does everybody know
about my fritters?
Tell me, I must know!

17:59.120 --> 18:01.790
Rolly, let it go.

18:07.500 --> 18:10.290
It's so c-c-cold.

18:10.290 --> 18:13.290
Ugh, what are you talking about?

18:13.290 --> 18:15.580
It's 80 degrees and stuffy.

18:15.580 --> 18:19.330
No, it's my nose.
It's so cold.

18:19.330 --> 18:21.040
How can you stand it?

18:21.040 --> 18:24.460
There. That ought
to warm you up.

18:26.120 --> 18:29.380
Hey, this sock smells
like feet.

18:29.380 --> 18:31.500
It might be filled
with toe germs.

18:31.500 --> 18:33.080
I could get sick.

18:33.080 --> 18:36.170
What if I get athlete's nose?
That could lead to nasal rot!

18:36.170 --> 18:38.210
She looks like a pup,

18:38.210 --> 18:40.710
but she's still
her old neurotic self.

18:48.670 --> 18:50.250
Where do you think
you're going?

18:50.250 --> 18:53.880
Digging. I wanna bury
a bone or something.

18:53.880 --> 18:57.250
But the vet's here.
We all have to get
our rabies shots.

18:57.250 --> 19:00.290
Yeah, well, remember,
it only hurts for a second.

19:00.290 --> 19:01.710
Be brave!

19:01.710 --> 19:02.750
See ya.

19:02.750 --> 19:05.120
Wrong! You're
a dog now.

19:05.120 --> 19:07.290
So that means you, too.

19:07.290 --> 19:09.210
-Next!

19:09.210 --> 19:11.790
No, wait, I was framed.

19:11.790 --> 19:14.040
I'm a chicken, look.

19:15.080 --> 19:16.580
No!

19:25.670 --> 19:28.670
Cadpig: Someone's
having trouble adjusting.

19:28.670 --> 19:30.620
Ah, we better
go get her.

19:30.620 --> 19:33.210
Gotta hide, gotta hide.
Gotta hide.

19:33.210 --> 19:36.670
Gotta lay low
until the doctor's gone.

19:44.040 --> 19:45.750
Owwww!

19:45.750 --> 19:47.500
The dog catcher!

19:53.000 --> 19:54.920
This calls for

19:54.920 --> 19:57.290
the Emergency
Dog Catcher
Confusion Drill. Go!

19:57.290 --> 20:00.620
man: Whoa! Hey! What?

20:12.960 --> 20:16.040
Lucky, Rolly, Cadpig!

20:16.040 --> 20:18.040
Lucky: Spot, we're in here.

20:19.290 --> 20:23.290
Don't worry, I'll fly up to
the window and get you guys out.

20:23.290 --> 20:25.120
Ehhhh!

20:25.120 --> 20:28.120
Uhhh! Oh, right.

20:28.120 --> 20:29.540
Paws, not wings.

20:29.540 --> 20:32.380
There's gotta be some other way
to get in that window!

20:39.210 --> 20:40.880
Ehhhh!

20:42.120 --> 20:46.170
Now, I'll just pick the door's
lock with my beak and...

20:49.290 --> 20:50.540
Uh-oh.

20:54.880 --> 20:56.750
Oh, what's the use?

20:56.750 --> 20:59.420
Doesn't matter if I'm
a dog or a chicken.

20:59.420 --> 21:01.080
I always mess everything up.

21:01.080 --> 21:03.920
But it's always
been your dream
to be a dog.

21:03.920 --> 21:04.960
Let's face it.

21:04.960 --> 21:08.080
Whatever I am,
I'm still me.

21:08.080 --> 21:09.960
And right now
I'd give it all up

21:09.960 --> 21:11.710
if I could
save you guys.

21:19.960 --> 21:22.420
Spot: It's my Fairy God-Chicken!

21:24.210 --> 21:26.500
I gotta get
these brakes checked.

21:26.500 --> 21:30.380
You sure you wanna
give up being a dog?

21:30.380 --> 21:34.290
That grass tasted
pretty good, didn't it?

21:34.290 --> 21:36.330
Do what you have to do.

21:36.330 --> 21:37.380
Poof!

21:40.580 --> 21:44.960
Ahh! Feathers! Beak!
And only two feet!

21:44.960 --> 21:46.880
Well, so long, kid.

21:46.880 --> 21:48.830
I'll see ya next wish.

21:51.290 --> 21:55.000
I'll just pick the lock
and then we'll get outta here.

21:57.920 --> 22:02.580
Uh, Spot, why don't you
just follow us out
this way, huh?

22:02.580 --> 22:05.120
Uh, because I'm stuck?

22:05.120 --> 22:07.710
Uggggh!
