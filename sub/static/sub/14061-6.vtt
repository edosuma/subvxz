00:00.001 --> 00:02.801
<i>Previously,</i>
<i>on</i> when calls the heart...

00:02.803 --> 00:04.736
Jack! I just
got this telegram--

00:04.738 --> 00:06.738
[jack]: Tom and julie were in
an automobile accident.

00:06.740 --> 00:08.973
[tom]: Nurse carter,
this is my brother.

00:08.975 --> 00:10.240
Mr. Avery.

00:10.242 --> 00:12.242
I wish you the best of luck
with everything.

00:12.244 --> 00:14.010
Jack?
What's happening?

00:14.012 --> 00:14.944
I'm not sure.

00:16.646 --> 00:18.413
[â™ª]

00:18.415 --> 00:19.714
I talked
to his physician.

00:19.716 --> 00:21.082
He said there's
no legitimate reason

00:21.084 --> 00:22.383
To keep him here
any longer.

00:22.385 --> 00:23.484
Can you
make something up?

00:23.486 --> 00:24.918
Like what?

00:24.920 --> 00:27.320
A case of
temporary insanity?

00:27.322 --> 00:28.854
Have him committed?

00:28.856 --> 00:30.355
That might work.

00:30.357 --> 00:31.489
Does it run
in the family?

00:31.491 --> 00:33.824
Well, only when
it comes to women.

00:33.826 --> 00:35.826
If you two
are talking about me,

00:35.828 --> 00:37.227
I'd like to hear
what you're saying.

00:37.229 --> 00:38.361
I'm just saying

00:38.363 --> 00:39.662
I know you'll be happy
to get out of here.

00:39.664 --> 00:41.397
The first thing
we're gonna do

00:41.399 --> 00:43.198
Is get something
to eat.

00:43.200 --> 00:44.332
No offense,

00:44.334 --> 00:45.566
But the food here
is terrible.

00:45.568 --> 00:47.501
We're famous for it.

00:47.503 --> 00:49.369
The first thing we need to do
is convince mr. Thatcher

00:49.371 --> 00:50.837
Not to press charges.

00:50.839 --> 00:51.871
How are we going to do that?

00:51.873 --> 00:52.872
"well, getting
you a job

00:52.874 --> 00:54.874
Out of town would be a start,

00:54.876 --> 00:57.209
And agreeing not to see julie
would help.

00:57.211 --> 01:01.178
My uncle is a foreman
at a quarry in fort mcneil.

01:01.180 --> 01:02.379
They're always hiring.

01:02.381 --> 01:05.181
I could contact him,
put in a good word.

01:05.183 --> 01:07.183
[jack]: That's a great idea.

01:07.185 --> 01:08.784
And don't even think about
arguing with me.

01:08.786 --> 01:10.051
I wasn't going to.

01:10.053 --> 01:11.352
I think it's a good idea.

01:11.354 --> 01:12.453
You do?

01:12.455 --> 01:14.421
I've had
enough trouble around here.

01:14.423 --> 01:16.856
Starting over
sounds okay to me.

01:16.858 --> 01:19.124
I got to say
I'm a little surprised.

01:19.126 --> 01:20.558
Well, maybe getting
knocked on the head

01:20.560 --> 01:23.193
Knocked some sense into me.

01:23.195 --> 01:25.595
You're looking at a new man.

01:25.597 --> 01:29.565
I'll get in touch
with my uncle.

01:29.567 --> 01:31.767
Now, as this is going to be
my going-away dinner,

01:31.769 --> 01:32.901
Looks like you're buying.

01:32.903 --> 01:35.303
[â™ª]

01:38.640 --> 01:40.474
[giggles]

01:41.876 --> 01:43.610
[fuming grumble]

01:43.612 --> 01:45.244
Florence?

01:45.246 --> 01:46.878
Are you all right?

01:46.880 --> 01:48.446
[weary sighing]

01:48.448 --> 01:50.915
I can't do it
anymore.

01:50.917 --> 01:53.050
I'm sorry. Do what?

01:53.052 --> 01:54.418
I am not
cut out for this.

01:54.420 --> 01:56.620
Do I need to get you
something to drink?

01:56.622 --> 01:58.722
I don't drink,
but I'm thinking of starting.

01:58.724 --> 01:59.823
Oh, no. Is it the children?

01:59.825 --> 02:00.790
You mean the little monsters?

02:00.792 --> 02:02.091
Where are they?

02:02.093 --> 02:03.225
Lunch.

02:03.227 --> 02:05.060
But isn't it 10:00?

02:05.062 --> 02:06.494
Who's counting?

02:06.496 --> 02:09.263
Come now, florence.
It can't be that bad.

02:09.265 --> 02:11.131
They're only children.

02:11.133 --> 02:12.765
I am <i>never</i> going back there.

02:12.767 --> 02:14.299
Never!

02:14.301 --> 02:16.734
What about
the founders' day play?

02:16.736 --> 02:18.135
They're gonna have to
find somebody else

02:18.137 --> 02:19.536
To direct
those little miscreants.

02:22.640 --> 02:24.140
You poor thing.

02:24.142 --> 02:26.609
Don't you worry.
I just have an idea.

02:26.611 --> 02:29.345
Because of
my professional experience,

02:29.347 --> 02:31.180
-I can take over the play.
-And the children?

02:31.182 --> 02:32.681
You'll take on
teaching the children as well?

02:33.816 --> 02:35.950
Sure. Why not?

02:35.952 --> 02:37.284
I love children.

02:37.286 --> 02:38.985
You'll get over that.

02:38.987 --> 02:40.286
But I won't be able
to start right away.

02:40.288 --> 02:42.154
-I have a deadline to meet.
-That's fine.

02:42.156 --> 02:44.322
After lunch...

02:44.324 --> 02:46.157
I'll send them home.

02:46.159 --> 02:47.291
Excuse me, ladies.

02:47.293 --> 02:48.492
-Oh!
-Hi, florence.

02:48.494 --> 02:50.093
Rosemary, look at that.

02:50.095 --> 02:53.930
Wow! Oh, it's heavy!
Is it real?

02:53.932 --> 02:55.431
Of course it's real!
It's solid gold.

02:55.433 --> 02:56.432
What is it?

02:56.434 --> 02:57.499
It's a railway
spike.

02:57.501 --> 02:59.167
You drive it into
the wooden cross ties

02:59.169 --> 03:01.002
That hold down
the iron rails.

03:01.004 --> 03:02.937
It's customary
to use a gold one

03:02.939 --> 03:04.171
When you're setting down
the last rail.

03:04.173 --> 03:06.673
I'm gonna use that one
when I finish my spur line.

03:06.675 --> 03:08.808
I was thinking maybe we could
have a ceremony or something,

03:08.810 --> 03:10.509
And you could help me.

03:10.511 --> 03:12.277
Oh! I would love to.
And I wouldn't be surprised

03:12.279 --> 03:14.078
If it makes the front page
of the paper.

03:15.113 --> 03:16.079
Excellent.

03:17.147 --> 03:21.083
[â™ª]

03:48.544 --> 03:50.811
[knocking, knob rattles]

03:50.813 --> 03:53.046
[elizabeth]:
Julie! Let me in!

03:53.048 --> 03:55.548
Just a minute!

04:04.223 --> 04:05.856
Why is the door locked?

04:05.858 --> 04:07.157
I have no idea.

04:07.159 --> 04:09.225
-What's happening?
-Nothing.

04:09.227 --> 04:10.593
Then what are
those clothes

04:10.595 --> 04:12.394
Doing on your bed?

04:12.396 --> 04:13.428
I was just
sorting out some things

04:13.430 --> 04:15.029
To give to charity.

04:15.031 --> 04:16.930
Julie, we need to talk
about what happened

04:16.932 --> 04:18.031
Between you and tom.

04:18.033 --> 04:19.332
You already know
what happened.

04:19.334 --> 04:20.566
I'm not sure I do.

04:20.568 --> 04:22.034
When the car
went off the road,

04:22.036 --> 04:23.035
Who was driving?

04:23.037 --> 04:24.936
What a strange question.

04:24.938 --> 04:27.538
You know I have
no idea how to drive.

04:27.540 --> 04:29.873
Well, you could've
convinced tom to let you try.

04:29.875 --> 04:31.174
Please. Do you really think
I'd do something that reckless?

04:31.176 --> 04:32.275
Yes.

04:32.277 --> 04:33.242
Well, that's
simply ridiculous.

04:33.244 --> 04:34.843
-Julie!
-If we don't hurry--

04:34.845 --> 04:37.011
...We're going to be late
for the bridesmaids fitting,

04:37.013 --> 04:38.212
And you know how viola gets
if anyone's late--

04:38.214 --> 04:39.246
Julie!
There's evidence.

04:39.248 --> 04:42.015
Jack found it.

04:42.017 --> 04:45.518
Now, will you please
just tell me the truth?

04:47.053 --> 04:50.121
Promise me you won't
say anything to father.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.622
I'm not gonna
say a word.

04:51.624 --> 04:53.223
Thank you.

04:53.225 --> 04:54.424
Because you're going to
tell him yourself.

04:54.426 --> 04:56.058
-I can't!
-Why not?

04:56.060 --> 04:57.392
Because he'll kill me!

04:57.394 --> 04:58.760
Julie, what's important

04:58.762 --> 05:00.461
Is that you take responsibility
for what happened.

05:00.463 --> 05:01.962
It won't matter!
Father will just be more angry

05:01.964 --> 05:03.897
Because tom let me drive
in the first place.

05:03.899 --> 05:05.365
Then you'll tell him
it wasn't tom's fault.

05:05.367 --> 05:06.566
He won't listen!

05:06.568 --> 05:08.467
Then you'll make him listen!

05:13.639 --> 05:14.872
[jonas]: I remember the time

05:14.874 --> 05:16.907
You faced off
against them whiskey-runners.

05:16.909 --> 05:21.110
They were mad as hornets,
and it was 10 against 1!

05:21.112 --> 05:22.311
Well, thank you, jonas,

05:22.313 --> 05:23.979
For making the story
better than it was,

05:23.981 --> 05:26.581
But I believe
it was only five.

05:26.583 --> 05:27.748
And you told 'em

05:27.750 --> 05:29.950
The odds were still
not in their favor!

05:29.952 --> 05:31.418
[laughs, then coughs]

05:31.420 --> 05:32.786
Jonas?

05:32.788 --> 05:34.554
[coughing intensely]

05:34.556 --> 05:36.455
This seems to help.

05:36.457 --> 05:38.924
I'm fine, I'm fine.

05:38.926 --> 05:41.426
Ain't this somethin'?

05:41.428 --> 05:43.261
I sure never thought
I'd end up like this.

05:43.263 --> 05:44.929
You'll be back
to your old self

05:44.931 --> 05:46.931
Before you know it.

05:46.933 --> 05:49.400
Probably time for me
to get some shut-eye.

05:49.402 --> 05:51.668
I'm sure...

05:51.670 --> 05:53.903
You two have
a lot to talk about.

06:03.479 --> 06:05.580
What did the doctors say?

06:05.582 --> 06:06.948
He's getting better.

06:06.950 --> 06:09.483
It's just so expensive
with all the medical bills.

06:09.485 --> 06:11.184
[sighing]

06:11.186 --> 06:13.419
That's not your worry.

06:13.421 --> 06:16.521
The important thing
is you're here.

06:17.623 --> 06:19.156
Nora...

06:19.158 --> 06:22.425
We can't just pick up
as if nothing's happened.

06:22.427 --> 06:25.361
Why not?
The past is in the past.

06:36.472 --> 06:39.440
Do you have any idea
how hard it was for me?

06:41.976 --> 06:43.977
I lost a son, too.

06:43.979 --> 06:45.812
Wasn't the same for you
as it was for me.

06:45.814 --> 06:48.147
Yes, it was!

06:48.149 --> 06:50.649
I was there
when martin was born.

06:50.651 --> 06:52.851
I held him in my arms
when he took his first breath,

06:52.853 --> 06:54.319
And I watched him grow.

06:54.321 --> 06:56.721
And I held him in my arms
when he took his last breath.

06:56.723 --> 06:58.189
I don't want to
talk about this.

06:58.191 --> 06:59.290
We have to
talk about it.

06:59.292 --> 07:00.324
First, martin was gone

07:00.326 --> 07:02.492
And then you.

07:02.494 --> 07:04.527
Do you have know
what that was like for me?

07:04.529 --> 07:07.129
I did what I had to do.

07:08.631 --> 07:10.498
Maybe you did.

07:10.500 --> 07:13.567
But it was something we needed
to go through together.

07:16.904 --> 07:18.471
[viola]:
I think we need

07:18.473 --> 07:20.873
To take in the sides
a little more, julie.

07:20.875 --> 07:24.309
"we"? I'm the one wearing it,
and it's tight enough already.

07:24.311 --> 07:26.911
I won't be able to eat anything
at the reception!

07:26.913 --> 07:29.180
Someone's
in better spirits.

07:29.182 --> 07:30.648
Especially for
someone whose life

07:30.650 --> 07:33.117
Was "in ruins"
a few hours ago.

07:33.119 --> 07:34.651
Oh. I'm over all that.

07:34.653 --> 07:36.953
And are you over tom?

07:36.955 --> 07:39.088
Yes.

07:40.123 --> 07:42.124
I am!

07:42.126 --> 07:44.025
I should've listened
to both of you.

07:44.027 --> 07:45.159
When I really thought about it,

07:45.161 --> 07:47.361
I realized
he wasn't right for me.

07:47.363 --> 07:48.595
Never would've worked out.

07:48.597 --> 07:49.629
Really?

07:49.631 --> 07:51.163
[julie]: Really!

07:51.165 --> 07:53.864
In fact, I was going to ask you
if lionel has any cousins.

07:55.666 --> 07:58.200
[â™ª]

08:01.103 --> 08:03.337
What a dreadful...

08:03.339 --> 08:04.971
[sighs pointedly]

08:04.973 --> 08:06.839
Oh, dear. Ha!

08:06.841 --> 08:08.874
Nobody talks like this. Oh!

08:08.876 --> 08:10.976
"the riches of the earth

08:10.978 --> 08:13.445
Brought forth the riches
to the valley..."

08:13.447 --> 08:17.015
[crumpling]

08:17.017 --> 08:18.483
What an absolute snore.

08:18.485 --> 08:20.952
[crumpling]

08:20.954 --> 08:22.887
Hello, lee.

08:22.889 --> 08:24.488
Hello, rosemary.
Am I interrupting?

08:24.490 --> 08:27.023
A welcome interruption.
Please, sit down.

08:27.025 --> 08:29.158
Thank you. I will.

08:29.160 --> 08:31.293
So what are you doing?

08:31.295 --> 08:33.395
Trying to fix
the founders' day play.

08:33.397 --> 08:35.130
Why? What's wrong
with it?

08:35.132 --> 08:36.731
Everything!

08:36.733 --> 08:38.599
The last time
they did it--

08:40.201 --> 08:43.236
Dottie ramsey decided
she wanted a bigger part,

08:43.238 --> 08:45.471
So she started
adding some things in.

08:45.473 --> 08:47.639
Well, everyone
in town did, too.

08:47.641 --> 08:50.908
Why is it everyone
who can hold a pencil

08:50.910 --> 08:52.643
Thinks that
they're a writer?

08:52.645 --> 08:54.845
I'm going to
have to start over.

08:54.847 --> 08:58.381
Before you do,
I, uh... Ahem.

08:58.383 --> 09:00.716
I have something
for you.

09:00.718 --> 09:02.350
What is that?

09:02.352 --> 09:04.085
Just a little thank-you

09:04.087 --> 09:07.254
For your help
with the poker game.

09:07.256 --> 09:09.189
Oh, lee!

09:09.191 --> 09:13.059
Oh, it's beautiful.
A four-leaf clover.

09:13.061 --> 09:15.761
For "lady luck."
you saved the town.

09:15.763 --> 09:17.028
Is that a diamond
in the center?

09:17.030 --> 09:18.929
Of course
it's a diamond!

09:18.931 --> 09:21.264
A real diamond?
Not glass?

09:21.266 --> 09:22.398
Do you think
that I would give you

09:22.400 --> 09:24.133
Glass instead of a diamond?

09:26.336 --> 09:30.272
I do like
real diamonds.

09:30.274 --> 09:33.174
Well, maybe I could get you
something a little nicer then.

09:35.944 --> 09:37.945
Well, I think
this one is just perfect.

09:37.947 --> 09:40.113
It's the perfect shape
and the perfect size--

09:40.115 --> 09:41.514
The perfect everything.

09:41.516 --> 09:44.583
I'll make sure I wear it
on opening night.

09:44.585 --> 09:46.217
That would be nice.

09:46.219 --> 09:48.919
Listen, rosemary...

09:48.921 --> 09:51.554
[exhales deeply]

09:51.556 --> 09:53.889
You and I
are two of a kind,

09:53.891 --> 09:55.023
And I was just--

09:55.025 --> 09:58.226
Lee...

09:58.228 --> 09:59.560
I have a meeting
with molly sullivan,

09:59.562 --> 10:01.628
And I'm already late.

10:01.630 --> 10:02.929
She's my costume designer,

10:02.931 --> 10:04.864
And I have some
very specific ideas

10:04.866 --> 10:05.931
About the "prairie
dog chorus."

10:05.933 --> 10:07.866
I'm thinking fur.

10:09.468 --> 10:11.835
If you'll excuse me?

10:13.103 --> 10:14.903
Yes. Uh, yes. Of course.

10:14.905 --> 10:16.938
Um...

10:16.940 --> 10:19.707
Give my regards

10:19.709 --> 10:22.375
To the prairie dogs
and the antelope.

10:23.577 --> 10:25.778
Thank you for
the beautiful gift.

10:26.913 --> 10:29.247
It's truly exquisite.

10:29.249 --> 10:31.782
You're very welcome.

10:33.284 --> 10:35.818
[â™ª]

10:46.262 --> 10:48.563
It's good to see you
again, constable.

10:48.565 --> 10:49.931
You as well.

10:49.933 --> 10:51.098
How's clara stanton?

10:51.100 --> 10:52.599
She's doing fine.

10:52.601 --> 10:54.133
Hope valley seems
to be agreeing with her.

10:54.135 --> 10:57.102
So, what brings you to see me?

10:57.104 --> 10:59.804
Well, this is difficult.

10:59.806 --> 11:01.806
Can I offer you a drink?

11:01.808 --> 11:03.774
No, no.
I'm-- I'm fine.

11:03.776 --> 11:06.443
Do you remember,
when I was here before,

11:06.445 --> 11:09.479
You offered me a reward
for the work I had done?

11:09.481 --> 11:11.247
I do. Why do you ask?

11:11.249 --> 11:12.781
I didn't feel
it was right

11:12.783 --> 11:15.016
To take anything
for helping mrs. Stanton,

11:15.018 --> 11:16.317
And I still
don't think it's right,

11:16.319 --> 11:18.819
But something's
come up.

11:18.821 --> 11:20.787
A very personal situation.

11:20.789 --> 11:24.257
I'm doing my best
to make it right, but...

11:24.259 --> 11:26.025
You want to know
if the offer still stands?

11:26.027 --> 11:27.359
If it doesn't, I understand,

11:27.361 --> 11:29.760
And I won't take up
any more of your time.

11:30.962 --> 11:32.028
We've turned a profit

11:32.030 --> 11:33.863
Since the day
we opened our doors.

11:33.865 --> 11:35.431
It's all right here.

11:35.433 --> 11:36.999
I expect costs are
going to go down,

11:37.001 --> 11:38.133
With the new spur line

11:38.135 --> 11:40.168
Bringing supplies
directly into town.

11:40.170 --> 11:42.470
Then why are you
so eager to sell?

11:42.472 --> 11:43.471
Well, mrs. Stanton
and I, uh, we have

11:43.473 --> 11:46.974
Our differences in
how to run the cafe,

11:46.976 --> 11:48.342
And we felt that
this was the best way

11:48.344 --> 11:49.309
To resolve them.

11:49.311 --> 11:50.643
I had my eye on

11:50.645 --> 11:52.878
Buying albert coleman's
place in grover's corners,

11:52.880 --> 11:55.113
But he was asking
a pretty penny.

11:55.115 --> 11:56.547
Well, I'm sure that

11:56.549 --> 11:57.948
If you come with
a reasonable offer,

11:57.950 --> 11:59.883
That we can make
an arrangement.

11:59.885 --> 12:03.119
I like doing business
with reasonable people.

12:03.121 --> 12:05.821
When can I expect
something in writing?

12:05.823 --> 12:07.222
Well, if the inspection
goes well,

12:07.224 --> 12:09.357
I should give you a number
by morning.

12:09.359 --> 12:10.791
Well, I'm starting
a new venture,

12:10.793 --> 12:13.760
So I'd like to get this moving
as quickly as possible.

12:18.231 --> 12:21.233
[tom]: â™ª life, alas
is very drear â™ª

12:21.235 --> 12:23.068
â™ª so up with the glass

12:23.070 --> 12:26.304
â™ª down with the beer

12:26.306 --> 12:27.872
Tom.

12:29.040 --> 12:30.507
What do you think
you're doing?

12:30.509 --> 12:32.976
Having a beer
with my friends.

12:32.978 --> 12:34.477
You were supposed
to be on the train

12:34.479 --> 12:36.145
To fort mcneil
this morning.

12:36.147 --> 12:39.181
Yeah. I think
I missed that train.

12:39.183 --> 12:40.482
[trio snickering]

12:40.484 --> 12:43.117
You guys mind
giving us a second?

12:47.688 --> 12:49.788
Thanks.

12:52.224 --> 12:53.757
So, I just got
a call faith's uncle

12:53.759 --> 12:55.558
When you didn't
show up.

12:55.560 --> 12:57.493
Why didn't you
take the job

12:57.495 --> 12:58.560
Like we agreed, tom?

12:58.562 --> 13:00.495
Working in a quarry
is dangerous.

13:00.497 --> 13:01.562
I don't think
that line of employment

13:01.564 --> 13:02.596
Is right for me, jack.

13:02.598 --> 13:04.998
What's right
for you, tom?

13:05.000 --> 13:07.200
Do you even know
what's right for you?

13:07.202 --> 13:08.367
It's my life, jack!

13:08.369 --> 13:10.869
My life.

13:10.871 --> 13:12.203
And you're
throwing it away.

13:12.205 --> 13:14.438
Let go of me!

13:20.744 --> 13:23.378
You know...
When dad died,

13:23.380 --> 13:26.280
I made
a promise to mom

13:26.282 --> 13:28.949
That I was gonna
look out for you.

13:28.951 --> 13:31.918
Well, I'm not
doing it anymore.

13:31.920 --> 13:33.920
You're on your own, tom.

13:33.922 --> 13:35.254
I've always
been on my own!

13:35.256 --> 13:36.421
What are you
talking about?

13:36.423 --> 13:38.856
When I got in trouble,

13:38.858 --> 13:41.024
Had to go live with grandpa,

13:41.026 --> 13:45.227
I begged you to ask mom
to let me stay on the farm.

13:45.229 --> 13:47.162
Remember?

13:48.397 --> 13:50.364
You didn't
say a thing.

13:50.366 --> 13:53.300
Were you
looking out for me then?

13:53.302 --> 13:56.636
I was too young to have
a say back then, tom.

13:56.638 --> 13:59.338
And you don't have one now.

14:02.542 --> 14:05.477
[â™ª]

14:11.649 --> 14:13.517
[knocking]

14:13.519 --> 14:15.385
Julie? I brought you some tea.

14:17.087 --> 14:19.088
Julie.

14:22.158 --> 14:24.091
[gasps]

14:26.527 --> 14:28.661
[â™ª]

14:32.265 --> 14:35.166
[kids shrieking and laughing]

14:39.003 --> 14:41.104
[â™ª]

14:51.948 --> 14:52.981
[whistles]

14:54.550 --> 14:55.583
All right, everyone.

14:55.585 --> 14:57.918
Places, please!

14:59.587 --> 15:01.921
Uh, take your seats.

15:04.891 --> 15:07.292
My name is miss leveaux,

15:07.294 --> 15:09.127
And I will be
your substitute teacher

15:09.129 --> 15:11.095
Until miss thatcher returns,

15:11.097 --> 15:12.629
But while you are under my care,

15:12.631 --> 15:14.864
I will also be a mentor,

15:14.866 --> 15:16.065
An inspiration,

15:16.067 --> 15:18.267
And...

15:18.269 --> 15:20.235
An advice counselor.

15:20.237 --> 15:21.903
Perhaps some of you have read
my column in the paper.

15:21.905 --> 15:23.738
I have!

15:23.740 --> 15:26.307
Well, you automatically
receive an "a" for today.

15:26.309 --> 15:27.975
[rosemary giggles]

15:29.143 --> 15:30.243
Yes?

15:30.245 --> 15:31.444
Will there be homework?

15:31.446 --> 15:33.045
Oh, no. Absolutely not.

15:33.047 --> 15:34.780
-[cheering]
-because...

15:34.782 --> 15:38.249
...We'll be too busy rehearsing
the founders' day play!

15:38.251 --> 15:39.250
[all groaning]

15:39.252 --> 15:40.751
Oh, no--

15:40.753 --> 15:43.153
I'm almost finished writing
a completely new script

15:43.155 --> 15:44.587
For you to perform,

15:44.589 --> 15:48.690
And there are plenty
of wonderful roles for everyone!

15:50.559 --> 15:52.393
No matter what the limits
of your talent.

15:52.395 --> 15:54.461
I will also be
directing the play

15:54.463 --> 15:56.663
And shaping your performances.

15:56.665 --> 15:58.665
Tryouts are this afternoon,

15:58.667 --> 16:01.434
But I still have a little bit
more work to do on the script,

16:01.436 --> 16:03.836
So while I'm doing that,
you can all take 10!

16:08.241 --> 16:10.775
Uh, recess.

16:10.777 --> 16:13.577
Recess. Off you go! Shoo.

16:13.579 --> 16:16.079
[â™ª]

16:25.989 --> 16:28.056
This is for you.

16:29.625 --> 16:31.292
What is it?

16:31.294 --> 16:33.193
Open it.

16:35.996 --> 16:37.863
Where did
you get this?

16:37.865 --> 16:40.198
It's reward money
from a job I did.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.767
You can use it to help pay
your father's medical bills.

16:42.769 --> 16:45.002
Thank you.
This means so much.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.136
I promised

16:46.138 --> 16:47.937
I would always take care
of you and jonas.

16:47.939 --> 16:49.705
Bill, please.

16:49.707 --> 16:51.473
Let me
make you dinner.

16:51.475 --> 16:53.842
It's the least I can do
to express my gratitude.

16:53.844 --> 16:55.343
I don't think it's a good idea.

16:55.345 --> 16:57.144
We need to talk.

16:57.146 --> 16:58.879
About what?

16:58.881 --> 17:02.014
I was thinking of what you said
when you were here before.

17:03.383 --> 17:05.984
Oh, sergeant avery.
Good to see you.

17:05.986 --> 17:07.051
How are you feeling, jonas?

17:07.053 --> 17:08.152
Oh, better,

17:08.154 --> 17:09.553
Now that you're here.

17:09.555 --> 17:12.188
I hope you're staying
for dinner.

17:12.190 --> 17:14.290
Of course.

17:18.461 --> 17:20.028
-Hello.
-Hi.

17:20.030 --> 17:21.696
Good day
at the river?

17:21.698 --> 17:23.998
My! You did
have a good day.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.866
Well, that's fishin'.
Feast or famine.

17:25.868 --> 17:27.834
But on the way back,
I suddenly thought,

17:27.836 --> 17:29.869
What am I going to do
with all this fish?

17:29.871 --> 17:31.136
And it occurred
to you

17:31.138 --> 17:33.638
There's a cafe that
might be able to use some.

17:33.640 --> 17:35.239
Well, I figured if
there's anyone in this town

17:35.241 --> 17:36.873
That could cook
a trout, it'd be you.

17:36.875 --> 17:38.407
I will happily
take those off your hands.

17:38.409 --> 17:40.041
We haven't had fish
on the menu

17:40.043 --> 17:41.175
In a long time!

17:41.177 --> 17:42.543
-That's great!
-But I have to pay you.

17:42.545 --> 17:43.977
Oh, no, no.

17:43.979 --> 17:45.578
Oh, no, I insist.

17:45.580 --> 17:48.881
All right.
Well, what's a fair price?

17:48.883 --> 17:51.149
Well, they're your fish.
It should be your decision.

17:51.151 --> 17:52.750
How about dinner?

17:52.752 --> 17:54.985
You just want me
to make you dinner?

17:54.987 --> 17:57.020
If it's not
too much trouble?

17:57.022 --> 18:01.057
Well, there must be over
a dozen fish in that basket.

18:01.059 --> 18:03.092
It seems like you're getting
the short end of the bargain.

18:03.094 --> 18:05.394
Well, I'll be
the judge of that.

18:05.396 --> 18:08.163
So have we got
ourselves a deal?

18:08.165 --> 18:10.498
Apparently, we do.

18:10.500 --> 18:11.532
Great.

18:11.534 --> 18:13.433
I'll see you tonight.

18:29.916 --> 18:31.349
Elizabeth.

18:31.351 --> 18:32.850
What's the matter?

18:32.852 --> 18:34.384
-Julie's gone.
-She's gone?

18:34.386 --> 18:35.852
She ran away.

18:35.854 --> 18:37.019
Her closet's empty,

18:37.021 --> 18:38.587
And there's
a suitcase missing.

18:38.589 --> 18:41.022
And jack,
you were right.

18:41.024 --> 18:42.390
Julie admitted
to driving the car

18:42.392 --> 18:43.958
When they got
in the accident.

18:43.960 --> 18:46.126
Well, any idea
where she went?

18:46.128 --> 18:48.661
No. But I think
I know who to ask.

18:54.434 --> 18:55.934
Sorry I'm late.

18:57.269 --> 18:59.737
Oh, I thought you might
have changed your mind.

18:59.739 --> 19:01.105
Are you sure you want to
go through with this?

19:01.107 --> 19:02.272
Of course.
Aren't you?

19:02.274 --> 19:03.573
Yeah. I just...

19:03.575 --> 19:05.107
I don't know how
I'm gonna support you.

19:05.109 --> 19:06.074
Well, don't
worry about that.

19:06.076 --> 19:07.208
We have my trust fund.

19:07.210 --> 19:08.375
If your father
doesn't cut you off.

19:08.377 --> 19:09.476
Well, then
we'll have each other.

19:09.478 --> 19:10.543
That's all we need.

19:10.545 --> 19:12.044
The rest will
take care of itself.

19:12.046 --> 19:13.645
[jack]: Tom!

19:14.647 --> 19:15.713
Tom!

19:15.715 --> 19:16.880
How did you know?

19:16.882 --> 19:17.914
The next time you run away,

19:17.916 --> 19:19.715
Don't use a chauffeur
to set it up.

19:19.717 --> 19:21.450
I need to talk
to you, alone.

19:21.452 --> 19:23.018
You can't
change our minds!

19:24.920 --> 19:26.420
It's okay, julie.

19:26.422 --> 19:28.387
It's just talk.

19:30.089 --> 19:32.222
[â™ª]

19:34.491 --> 19:35.991
Of all the foolish
things you've done,

19:35.993 --> 19:37.792
This is by far
the most outrageous.

19:37.794 --> 19:38.959
What are you
thinking, julie?

19:38.961 --> 19:40.060
I love tom and--

19:40.062 --> 19:41.094
If you love him,

19:41.096 --> 19:42.095
You won't
let him do this.

19:42.097 --> 19:44.163
It's what we both want.

19:44.165 --> 19:46.565
Julie, if you two
run away together,

19:46.567 --> 19:48.066
You deny him the chance
to get a good job,

19:48.068 --> 19:49.667
To start a new life,

19:49.669 --> 19:51.835
To make something
of himself.

19:51.837 --> 19:53.636
Is that what
you want for tom?

19:54.904 --> 19:56.471
Of course not.

19:56.473 --> 20:00.408
Then start thinking of him
and not only of yourself.

20:07.448 --> 20:09.982
It's been a very good thing
for this town,

20:09.984 --> 20:11.450
Getting that sawmill built.

20:11.452 --> 20:12.451
It's given
the men work

20:12.453 --> 20:13.518
And everyone
is happy.

20:13.520 --> 20:15.453
But with all the new people

20:15.455 --> 20:17.021
That the mill
will bring to town,

20:17.023 --> 20:18.989
How will we entertain them?

20:18.991 --> 20:20.256
You're in luck!

20:20.258 --> 20:22.324
My name
is rosemary leveaux,

20:22.326 --> 20:24.793
And I'm an actress.

20:24.795 --> 20:26.995
[giggles]

20:26.997 --> 20:28.196
Miss leveaux,

20:28.198 --> 20:30.198
Can we change the lines?

20:30.200 --> 20:32.366
We don't think
that a mayor

20:32.368 --> 20:34.534
Would be talking about
entertaining people.

20:35.836 --> 20:37.102
Children...

20:37.104 --> 20:39.804
You're actors.

20:39.806 --> 20:42.840
Denizens of the theater.

20:42.842 --> 20:45.142
And an actor's job

20:45.144 --> 20:48.979
Is to discover why
their character would say

20:48.981 --> 20:52.549
What the author has written.

20:52.551 --> 20:54.751
Okay. We thought
that maybe--

20:54.753 --> 20:55.985
Albert.

20:55.987 --> 20:58.721
I need someone
to play the aspen tree.

20:58.723 --> 21:00.889
And since
you're a big, strong boy,

21:00.891 --> 21:03.258
Well, I think that might be
a much better role for you.

21:03.260 --> 21:05.660
And you won't have to worry
about what your character says,

21:05.662 --> 21:08.496
Because trees don't talk.

21:16.270 --> 21:19.738
I like my lines
just the way they are.

21:19.740 --> 21:21.706
Good.

21:23.141 --> 21:24.908
It's not for sale.

21:24.910 --> 21:26.175
You don't seem
to understand.

21:26.177 --> 21:28.243
Mr. Tower is
offering to pay us

21:28.245 --> 21:30.678
Three times the value
of our investment!

21:31.980 --> 21:33.113
It seems
quite coincidental

21:33.115 --> 21:35.515
That your sudden desire
to sell the cafe

21:35.517 --> 21:36.816
Comes so soon after

21:36.818 --> 21:39.351
You lost all that land and money
in a poker game.

21:39.353 --> 21:40.985
That has nothing
to do with it.

21:40.987 --> 21:42.353
This is about
dollars and cents,

21:42.355 --> 21:44.621
And this is
a very good deal!

21:44.623 --> 21:46.122
For you, maybe.

21:46.124 --> 21:48.424
This cafe is my livelihood
and it's my home.

21:48.426 --> 21:50.526
I have no intention of selling.

21:50.528 --> 21:52.094
You can take
your half of the money

21:52.096 --> 21:54.763
And open up your own place
without me as a partner.

21:54.765 --> 21:57.365
[scoffs] and build
from the ground up?

21:57.367 --> 21:58.966
You know I couldn't
afford to do that.

21:58.968 --> 22:00.834
This offer is not gonna
be on the table long.

22:00.836 --> 22:02.635
Mr. Tower wants
to move quickly,

22:02.637 --> 22:04.203
So I strongly urge you

22:04.205 --> 22:06.772
To take a moment
and reconsider.

22:06.774 --> 22:08.774
All right.

22:10.276 --> 22:13.144
I've reconsidered.
The answer is still no.

22:13.146 --> 22:15.146
You are making a huge mistake!

22:15.148 --> 22:17.681
And I promise you,
you're going to regret it.

22:17.683 --> 22:19.282
If that's a threat, mr. Gowen,

22:19.284 --> 22:21.150
I suggest
you don't cross the people

22:21.152 --> 22:22.751
Who prepare your food.

22:23.986 --> 22:26.220
[â™ª]

22:30.958 --> 22:32.692
Why is everyone against me?

22:32.694 --> 22:35.528
That is so far
from the truth.

22:35.530 --> 22:37.563
Then why are you
treating me so badly?

22:37.565 --> 22:39.898
Honestly, julie,
you have got to grow up.

22:39.900 --> 22:41.866
What does that mean?

22:41.868 --> 22:44.568
It means
that your life should be

22:44.570 --> 22:46.870
More than shopping sprees
and chasing men.

22:46.872 --> 22:49.038
You should be
finding your purpose.

22:49.040 --> 22:50.372
Don't you think I know that?

22:50.374 --> 22:52.507
I was going to start
a completely new life with tom.

22:52.509 --> 22:54.041
By lying to your family
and running away?

22:54.043 --> 22:56.309
You ran away
and left the family!

22:56.311 --> 22:57.843
I did not run away.
I ran to something.

22:57.845 --> 22:59.344
There's a difference.

22:59.346 --> 23:01.312
I wanted to find a place where
I could fulfill my destiny,

23:01.314 --> 23:02.880
And I found it in teaching,

23:02.882 --> 23:04.414
In working with children

23:04.416 --> 23:06.215
And making a difference
in their lives.

23:07.650 --> 23:10.384
I don't know
what makes me feel fulfilled.

23:11.686 --> 23:14.653
The only way to find out
is to start looking.

23:16.155 --> 23:18.856
And taking responsibility
for your behavior

23:18.858 --> 23:20.824
Is the first step.

23:20.826 --> 23:22.425
You can start
by telling father

23:22.427 --> 23:24.059
The truth
about the car...

23:24.061 --> 23:25.727
[sighs anxiously]

23:25.729 --> 23:27.628
All right.
I'll tell him.

23:29.530 --> 23:31.330
But I can't let tom go
without saying goodbye.

23:31.332 --> 23:33.765
Please, elizabeth?
Can you arrange that?

23:33.767 --> 23:37.067
I'd give anything
to see him one last time.

23:38.235 --> 23:40.602
[â™ª]

23:41.870 --> 23:43.770
Okay. Thank you, faith.

23:45.205 --> 23:47.605
Guys, will you give us
a minute, please?

23:49.074 --> 23:51.241
I just got off the phone
with faith.

23:51.243 --> 23:53.176
You're in luck.

23:53.178 --> 23:56.711
Her uncle's keeping
that job open for you.

23:56.713 --> 23:59.046
Who cares?

23:59.048 --> 24:00.113
William thatcher

24:00.115 --> 24:02.548
Still wants to see
me rot in hell.

24:02.550 --> 24:04.416
Nothing I do is ever
gonna be good enough

24:04.418 --> 24:05.750
For his daughter.

24:05.752 --> 24:06.751
Well, at least
it's a step

24:06.753 --> 24:08.552
In the right
direction, tom.

24:08.554 --> 24:10.754
You just think I'm one
big screw-up, don't you?

24:10.756 --> 24:12.188
No, I don't.

24:12.190 --> 24:13.522
Because I remember
what you were like

24:13.524 --> 24:15.423
Before dad died.

24:15.425 --> 24:18.426
You were a good kid.
A responsible kid.

24:18.428 --> 24:20.561
But after
he was gone...

24:20.563 --> 24:22.896
Everything changed.

24:22.898 --> 24:24.831
It wasn't fair.

24:25.899 --> 24:28.367
But it happened.

24:28.369 --> 24:30.468
And we all had
to deal with it.

24:31.903 --> 24:34.271
Except, tom...

24:34.273 --> 24:36.373
I don't think
you ever did.

24:36.375 --> 24:38.074
You did, right?

24:38.076 --> 24:39.442
Yeah.

24:39.444 --> 24:41.644
But I knew
I wanted to be

24:41.646 --> 24:44.379
Someone who was
worthy of his respect.

24:45.714 --> 24:48.782
I mean... That's why
I became a mountie.

24:50.284 --> 24:52.218
But the truth is...

24:57.256 --> 24:58.556
I never felt like

24:58.558 --> 25:00.424
I was good enough
for him.

25:00.426 --> 25:02.793
[snickers] you?

25:02.795 --> 25:04.561
Not good enough?

25:04.563 --> 25:06.563
You were
his favorite, tom.

25:06.565 --> 25:07.964
Not me.

25:07.966 --> 25:09.465
[scoffs] that's a crock.

25:09.467 --> 25:10.799
I heard him once.

25:10.801 --> 25:11.933
He was bragging
to his buddies,

25:11.935 --> 25:15.136
About how smart
you were.

25:15.138 --> 25:17.104
He said
I took after mom,

25:17.106 --> 25:18.438
But you...

25:18.440 --> 25:21.240
You-- you were a chip
off the old block.

25:21.242 --> 25:23.207
Just like him.

25:26.177 --> 25:28.545
Did he really say that?

25:29.613 --> 25:32.147
Yeah, he did.

25:32.149 --> 25:35.250
He was so proud of you.

25:35.252 --> 25:38.953
But I don't think
he'd be proud of you right now.

25:38.955 --> 25:41.355
And it would break his heart

25:41.357 --> 25:43.490
To know that his death
was the reason why

25:43.492 --> 25:45.525
You were throwing
your life away.

25:46.627 --> 25:48.127
I'm sorry, jack.

25:48.129 --> 25:49.595
Hey, you're getting

25:49.597 --> 25:52.364
A second chance to be the son
that dad was proud of.

25:52.366 --> 25:53.998
[sniffs]

25:55.633 --> 25:58.201
Look, here's something
to help keep you focused

25:58.203 --> 26:00.002
On what's important.

26:00.004 --> 26:01.970
His watch?

26:01.972 --> 26:04.539
Yeah.

26:04.541 --> 26:06.574
He'd want you to have it.

26:15.216 --> 26:18.017
Tom... I believe in you.

26:21.488 --> 26:22.988
[takes a shaky breath]

26:22.990 --> 26:25.590
[â™ª]

26:33.498 --> 26:35.365
Papa's asleep.

26:35.367 --> 26:36.833
Good, good.

26:36.835 --> 26:38.968
I have to be going.

26:38.970 --> 26:40.569
Would you like
to stay for coffee?

26:40.571 --> 26:43.405
No, but thank you
for dinner.

26:43.407 --> 26:45.240
Bill, the money you brought--

26:45.242 --> 26:47.542
It was more than generous.

26:47.544 --> 26:48.576
Well, I'm glad
I could do it.

26:48.578 --> 26:49.877
I was thinking
about what you said

26:49.879 --> 26:51.345
The last time you were here,

26:51.347 --> 26:52.913
And you were right.

26:52.915 --> 26:54.514
About what, exactly?

26:54.516 --> 26:55.715
When I left you,

26:55.717 --> 26:57.483
I was thinking
about my own pain,

26:57.485 --> 26:59.418
And not about you.

26:59.420 --> 27:02.521
I guess I always thought
of martin as my son,

27:02.523 --> 27:04.055
And not yours.

27:04.057 --> 27:06.824
I felt like he was
an obligation to you.

27:06.826 --> 27:08.725
Nothing could be
further from the truth.

27:08.727 --> 27:10.527
I made a lot
of mistakes.

27:10.529 --> 27:12.962
I know that now,
so I want to apologize.

27:12.964 --> 27:14.263
You don't
need to do that.

27:14.265 --> 27:15.864
Yes, I do.

27:15.866 --> 27:17.765
What I did was selfish.

27:17.767 --> 27:19.933
I didn't realize
what I had in you.

27:19.935 --> 27:22.835
I didn't see that you were
always there for me.

27:22.837 --> 27:24.169
Can you forgive me?

27:24.171 --> 27:25.870
-Nora...
-Please.

27:25.872 --> 27:28.038
I need to hear
you say it.

27:30.975 --> 27:32.608
Yes.

27:32.610 --> 27:35.177
Of course
I forgive you.

27:40.516 --> 27:42.683
When will I see you again?

27:42.685 --> 27:45.152
I'm leaving town
on a case.

27:45.154 --> 27:46.786
For how long?

27:46.788 --> 27:49.287
As long as it
takes, I imagine.

27:51.456 --> 27:54.357
[â™ª]

27:57.127 --> 27:59.895
I told him
I'm not interested in selling,

27:59.897 --> 28:01.863
But I don't trust him.

28:01.865 --> 28:04.632
Henry gowen has a strange way
of landing on his feet.

28:04.634 --> 28:07.001
I've known a lot
of men like him.

28:07.003 --> 28:08.402
They're smart.

28:08.404 --> 28:09.970
You just can't turn
your back to 'em.

28:09.972 --> 28:14.140
Sounds like you're
speaking from experience.

28:14.142 --> 28:16.475
What church did you
call home before this?

28:16.477 --> 28:19.644
Actually, hope valley
is my first congregation.

28:19.646 --> 28:21.712
Really?

28:21.714 --> 28:23.747
I would've
never guessed.

28:23.749 --> 28:25.415
Seems to come to you
so naturally.

28:25.417 --> 28:28.184
Well, like they say,
it's a calling.

28:28.186 --> 28:30.452
What did you do before
you were a minister?

28:31.754 --> 28:34.522
I knocked around
a bit. You know?

28:34.524 --> 28:36.490
Odd jobs,
this and that.

28:36.492 --> 28:38.758
And then one day
you just decided

28:38.760 --> 28:40.593
You'd become
a man of the cloth?

28:44.730 --> 28:47.698
One day, I almost died.

28:47.700 --> 28:50.267
That kind of thing
makes you see life

28:50.269 --> 28:51.835
In a different light.

28:51.837 --> 28:54.571
It sort of
puts a perspective

28:54.573 --> 28:56.239
On what's important

28:56.241 --> 28:58.240
And what's not.

28:59.909 --> 29:02.076
[â™ª]

29:10.251 --> 29:12.752
Jack! [laughs]

29:12.754 --> 29:14.353
What are you doing here?

29:14.355 --> 29:15.754
Thank you, faith.

29:15.756 --> 29:17.622
For what?

29:17.624 --> 29:20.057
For everything you did
for my brother.

29:20.059 --> 29:21.591
They're beautiful.

29:21.593 --> 29:23.859
I'm guessing
you're leaving?

29:23.861 --> 29:26.862
Yeah. Yeah, I'm headed
back to hope valley.

29:26.864 --> 29:28.530
Will you be coming
back to hamilton?

29:28.532 --> 29:30.198
I don't know.

29:30.200 --> 29:32.400
Someday, I guess.

29:32.402 --> 29:35.035
I hope it's soon.

29:35.037 --> 29:37.871
You know...

29:37.873 --> 29:40.440
I'm really glad
I met you, faith.

29:40.442 --> 29:42.274
Me too.

29:44.243 --> 29:46.611
And jack...

29:46.613 --> 29:48.412
Don't forget who you are.

29:48.414 --> 29:50.280
I won't.

29:54.384 --> 29:56.952
Until we meet again.

30:18.741 --> 30:20.575
Quickly.

30:20.577 --> 30:22.476
I'll be waiting for you
up there.

30:30.618 --> 30:33.620
Please tell me
this isn't goodbye.

30:33.622 --> 30:35.688
We're only gonna be apart
for a little while.

30:35.690 --> 30:37.990
It's better for
the both of us this way.

30:37.992 --> 30:39.424
Not for me.

30:39.426 --> 30:40.625
Julie...

30:40.627 --> 30:43.027
I've made some mistakes.

30:43.029 --> 30:46.330
I've got to find
my own way

30:46.332 --> 30:48.298
And I've got to
do it on my own.

30:48.300 --> 30:50.633
So I was
a mistake?

30:50.635 --> 30:51.767
No! No. Not at all.

30:51.769 --> 30:53.835
I was ready
to run away with you,

30:53.837 --> 30:56.504
Spend the rest of
my life with you.

30:56.506 --> 30:57.871
We could still do it.

31:00.307 --> 31:01.340
No.

31:02.608 --> 31:04.208
Why not?

31:04.210 --> 31:06.143
Because you deserve
better than that.

31:06.145 --> 31:07.811
You deserve someone

31:07.813 --> 31:10.480
Who's not gonna
run away from trouble,

31:10.482 --> 31:12.381
Someone who can find
his own way in the world,

31:12.383 --> 31:13.615
Someone who makes you happy.

31:13.617 --> 31:15.650
You make me happy.

31:15.652 --> 31:17.051
Then wait for me

31:17.053 --> 31:19.286
To become the person
I need to be.

31:19.288 --> 31:22.022
For both of us.

31:22.024 --> 31:24.824
Look, I've messed up
a lot lately,

31:24.826 --> 31:26.792
But I know
I can be that person

31:26.794 --> 31:29.661
If I try.

31:29.663 --> 31:31.529
I know you can, too.

31:33.698 --> 31:35.699
You're the best thing
that's ever happened to me,

31:35.701 --> 31:36.933
Julie thatcher.

31:40.003 --> 31:42.604
[â™ª]

31:45.307 --> 31:47.741
[applauding]

31:49.009 --> 31:50.976
Bravo, children!

31:50.978 --> 31:53.011
An excellent,
excellent rehearsal,

31:53.013 --> 31:54.846
And after you take your bow,

31:54.848 --> 31:56.180
I will take mine.

31:56.182 --> 31:58.815
Be patient,
this is sure to take a while,

31:58.817 --> 32:01.851
And then we all exit,
stage left.

32:01.853 --> 32:03.385
You're dismissed.

32:03.387 --> 32:04.386
Oh! Now everyone,

32:04.388 --> 32:05.820
I want you back here

32:05.822 --> 32:08.522
Tomorrow morning half an hour
before school starts

32:08.524 --> 32:11.091
So that we can run through
everything one last time.

32:11.093 --> 32:12.692
Not again.

32:12.694 --> 32:15.594
There is a very famous theater
in new york

32:15.596 --> 32:16.895
Called carnegie hall,

32:16.897 --> 32:18.596
And how do we get there?

32:18.598 --> 32:21.365
"practice,
practice, practice."

32:21.367 --> 32:23.266
You, my dear,
are going to be a star.

32:26.036 --> 32:27.336
Mrs. Blakeley,

32:27.338 --> 32:28.603
When is miss thatcher
coming back?

32:28.605 --> 32:30.271
Oh! Well, I believe

32:30.273 --> 32:31.872
She's coming back
in a few days, albert.

32:31.874 --> 32:33.173
Do you miss her?

32:33.175 --> 32:34.774
All we've done
with miss leveaux

32:34.776 --> 32:36.776
Is practice
that dumb play.

32:36.778 --> 32:38.043
We'd even be happy

32:38.045 --> 32:39.944
If you came back
to teach.

32:39.946 --> 32:41.712
That's very sweet
of you, albert.

32:41.714 --> 32:43.280
Why don't you run along

32:43.282 --> 32:45.782
And get out of
that tree?

32:49.953 --> 32:51.186
Well...

32:51.188 --> 32:54.289
I have to admit,
I am impressed.

32:54.291 --> 32:56.257
Save your applause
for the performance.

32:56.259 --> 32:58.058
Rosemary,
I need to talk to you.

32:58.060 --> 33:00.193
Um, I'm afraid

33:00.195 --> 33:02.929
I've been operating
under a misconception about you.

33:02.931 --> 33:04.463
What kind of a misconception?

33:04.465 --> 33:07.799
Up until I gave you
that little gift,

33:07.801 --> 33:09.300
I was under the assumption

33:09.302 --> 33:11.769
That we were thinking
about our relationship

33:11.771 --> 33:14.138
Along the same lines.

33:14.140 --> 33:16.940
Well, I told you
I loved the four-leaf clover.

33:16.942 --> 33:19.242
And then I said that I could get
you something nicer.

33:19.244 --> 33:21.143
[chuckles]

33:21.145 --> 33:24.045
You certainly know how to sweep
a girl off her feet, don't you?

33:24.047 --> 33:25.980
I am trying my best.

33:25.982 --> 33:28.615
Well, that's just it, lee.

33:28.617 --> 33:31.584
I'm not sure I'm...

33:31.586 --> 33:34.119
Ready to be swept away

33:34.121 --> 33:35.753
Just yet.

33:35.755 --> 33:37.488
I see.

33:37.490 --> 33:41.291
And... When do you think
you might know?

33:41.293 --> 33:43.059
Well, it's hard to say.

33:43.061 --> 33:44.960
Hmm.

33:44.962 --> 33:46.328
[stammers, sighs]

33:46.330 --> 33:49.130
Affairs of the heart...

33:50.332 --> 33:52.599
They can just be
so unpredictable.

33:52.601 --> 33:54.634
They most certainly
can be--

33:54.636 --> 33:55.801
I'm not playing
hard-to-get.

33:55.803 --> 33:57.469
No, no.
Of course not.

33:57.471 --> 34:00.338
So you understand?

34:00.340 --> 34:03.808
Yes, I understand.
Completely.

34:03.810 --> 34:05.910
I knew you would.

34:09.313 --> 34:11.915
[â™ª]

34:22.860 --> 34:25.461
-Hi.
-Hello. Ni[â™ª] see you.

34:25.463 --> 34:28.230
I've spoken to
the owner of the company.

34:28.232 --> 34:29.798
The job
is waiting for him.

34:29.800 --> 34:31.633
That's excellent news.

34:31.635 --> 34:33.868
I believe it will give
tom a fresh start in life,

34:33.870 --> 34:36.470
As long as he can
put what's happened

34:36.472 --> 34:38.805
Here in hamilton
behind him.

34:38.807 --> 34:40.439
Let me say this,
constable.

34:40.441 --> 34:42.741
As long as tom stays
out of hamilton

34:42.743 --> 34:44.109
And far away
from julie,

34:44.111 --> 34:45.477
I can promise you,

34:45.479 --> 34:47.111
He'll have nothing
to worry about from me.

34:47.113 --> 34:48.879
I believe that's
more than fair.

34:48.881 --> 34:50.080
Thank you, sir.

34:50.082 --> 34:51.247
Well, thank you.

34:51.249 --> 34:53.115
Your help in this matter
is much appreciated.

34:53.117 --> 34:55.983
Well, I'd best be
on my way.

34:57.552 --> 34:59.185
Constable.

35:00.921 --> 35:03.756
You've made quite
an impression on elizabeth,

35:03.758 --> 35:05.724
And I've always felt
she had good taste

35:05.726 --> 35:07.926
In the people she chose
to associate with.

35:07.928 --> 35:09.494
I can't hold what
your brother has done

35:09.496 --> 35:10.928
Against you,

35:10.930 --> 35:12.763
And I'm prepared

35:12.765 --> 35:15.731
To offer you
a position at my company.

35:17.300 --> 35:19.634
Thank you, sir.

35:19.636 --> 35:21.602
But I can't say

35:21.604 --> 35:24.504
I'm really cut out for
sitting behind a desk.

35:24.506 --> 35:25.738
I'd teach you the ropes,

35:25.740 --> 35:27.406
And you would work
your way up the ladder

35:27.408 --> 35:29.408
To a position of leadership
and responsibility

35:29.410 --> 35:30.475
Here in hamilton.

35:30.477 --> 35:32.443
With all due respect,

35:32.445 --> 35:33.777
I believe

35:33.779 --> 35:36.846
That the work a man does
defines who he is.

35:36.848 --> 35:39.582
I'm very proud
of what I do.

35:39.584 --> 35:41.784
I don't think
you realize what I'm saying.

35:41.786 --> 35:43.285
This is an opportunity

35:43.287 --> 35:46.154
To take a position of importance
within society.

35:46.156 --> 35:48.256
To become...
Accepted.

35:48.258 --> 35:49.857
"accepted."

35:49.859 --> 35:51.891
Yes.

35:53.493 --> 35:56.761
I appreciate the offer.

35:56.763 --> 35:58.929
I know it's a very
generous one.

35:58.931 --> 35:59.996
Then you also know

35:59.998 --> 36:01.530
You'd be a fool
to turn it down.

36:01.532 --> 36:06.167
An offer like this one
is made only once.

36:08.537 --> 36:12.506
Well, I'm sorry,
but my answer is still no, sir.

36:12.508 --> 36:14.774
I think you
should reconsider.

36:14.776 --> 36:17.443
I have no intention

36:17.445 --> 36:20.045
Of trying to be
something that I'm not.

36:20.047 --> 36:21.946
Not for any reason.

36:23.515 --> 36:25.448
And not for anyone.

36:28.351 --> 36:31.085
Good day, mr. Thatcher.

36:33.955 --> 36:35.956
[â™ª]

36:35.958 --> 36:37.891
Good day, constable.

36:51.037 --> 36:54.205
Bank get back to us
about the loan?

36:54.207 --> 36:56.840
They're not
going to approve it.

36:56.842 --> 36:58.842
Mr. Jenkins says

36:58.844 --> 37:01.177
That you don't have
enough collateral.

37:01.179 --> 37:03.579
[â™ª]

37:05.248 --> 37:08.383
Jenkins dares to ask me
for collateral?

37:12.721 --> 37:15.723
I'll put his pathetic
little bank out of business.

37:15.725 --> 37:16.924
If it wasn't for me,

37:16.926 --> 37:19.826
That hayseed would
still be pushing a plow.

37:19.828 --> 37:22.495
What would you
like me to do?

37:22.497 --> 37:23.996
Deliver a message.

37:23.998 --> 37:25.497
To mr. Jenkins?

37:25.499 --> 37:27.732
Not to jenkins.

37:27.734 --> 37:30.000
[â™ª]

37:37.174 --> 37:39.241
[â™ª]

37:46.181 --> 37:47.214
That's not fair.

37:47.216 --> 37:48.715
You've been practicing.

37:48.717 --> 37:50.750
Mm. Guilty as charged.

37:50.752 --> 37:52.384
How about one more?

37:52.386 --> 37:53.952
No. I can't.

37:53.954 --> 37:55.586
Keeping up with you
is exhausting.

37:55.588 --> 37:57.287
Besides, I have to
start packing.

37:57.289 --> 37:58.621
I'm leaving tomorrow.

37:58.623 --> 37:59.955
Your father wants me

37:59.957 --> 38:01.122
To negotiate another
contract with lee coulter,

38:01.124 --> 38:02.890
So we'll just have
to continue this

38:02.892 --> 38:04.323
The next time
I'm in hope valley.

38:06.693 --> 38:09.428
Charles...

38:09.430 --> 38:11.897
You know how I adore you.

38:11.899 --> 38:13.798
You've been a life-long
friend to me,

38:13.800 --> 38:16.200
And there's nothing
I wouldn't do for you,

38:16.202 --> 38:19.436
But I can't let this
continue any longer.

38:19.438 --> 38:21.304
What do you mean?

38:21.306 --> 38:24.807
I've enjoyed every moment
we've spent together.

38:24.809 --> 38:27.643
But this isn't fair to you.

38:27.645 --> 38:29.044
You deserve better than this.

38:29.046 --> 38:30.412
Elizabeth.

38:30.414 --> 38:33.148
I know you believe
you're doing the right thing.

38:33.150 --> 38:34.883
And if the situation
were reversed,

38:34.885 --> 38:37.652
I'd be telling you exactly
what you're telling me.

38:37.654 --> 38:39.654
Thank you for
being so understanding.

38:39.656 --> 38:41.288
But...

38:41.290 --> 38:45.124
As someone
who sees you as...

38:45.126 --> 38:47.659
Possibly more than
a friend,

38:47.661 --> 38:50.728
I feel I have to be
the one to make the decision

38:50.730 --> 38:54.465
As to when it's time for me
to consider other options.

38:54.467 --> 38:56.066
I don't want
to argue, but--

38:56.068 --> 38:58.802
Then don't.

39:02.239 --> 39:04.673
Why did he ask you
to talk to me, dottie?

39:04.675 --> 39:06.574
He doesn't think
you're taking him seriously,

39:06.576 --> 39:08.008
And I would,
if I were you, abigail.

39:08.010 --> 39:10.143
I've never seen him
quite like this.

39:10.145 --> 39:11.644
Oh, it's just
his usual bluster.

39:11.646 --> 39:12.978
I don't think so.

39:12.980 --> 39:15.280
You've painted henry
into a corner.

39:15.282 --> 39:17.282
He's like
a trapped animal,

39:17.284 --> 39:19.250
And they can be
the most dangerous kind.

39:19.252 --> 39:21.685
I'm quite capable of
handling myself, thank you.

39:21.687 --> 39:23.253
He can put you
out of business.

39:23.255 --> 39:24.621
He can try.

39:24.623 --> 39:26.756
I am giving you advice.

39:26.758 --> 39:28.124
And if you know
what's good for you,

39:28.126 --> 39:29.492
You will take it.

39:29.494 --> 39:30.926
Dottie, are you
threatening me?

39:30.928 --> 39:33.361
I'm just saying you're
going to be very sorry

39:33.363 --> 39:34.795
If you don't
sell the cafe.

39:34.797 --> 39:36.196
[â™ª]

39:39.466 --> 39:42.000
[elizabeth]: This certainly
has been quite the trip.

39:42.002 --> 39:44.202
Let's just hope the next time
I have to come to hamilton

39:44.204 --> 39:45.770
It won't be because
of some crisis.

39:45.772 --> 39:47.004
How's tom?

39:47.006 --> 39:49.473
Tom is in good spirits.

39:49.475 --> 39:52.175
I think he's finally getting
himself on the right track.

39:52.177 --> 39:55.978
Good. Hopefully,
he'll forget all about julie.

39:55.980 --> 39:57.813
Well, let's hope julie
forgets about him, too.

39:57.815 --> 39:59.881
I think the expression
is "it takes two to tango."

39:59.883 --> 40:02.283
Yes! But
you have to admit,

40:02.285 --> 40:04.051
Trouble does seem
to follow tom

40:04.053 --> 40:06.286
Wherever he goes.

40:06.288 --> 40:08.554
Of course
you'd see it that way.

40:08.556 --> 40:10.522
What do you
mean by that?

40:10.524 --> 40:12.991
Well, my family doesn't have
the breeding yours does,

40:12.993 --> 40:14.692
So of course
we're always the problem.

40:14.694 --> 40:16.160
Jack, I didn't say that.

40:16.162 --> 40:18.195
My brother and I,
we don't exactly fit

40:18.197 --> 40:19.496
The image
your parents have

40:19.498 --> 40:21.164
Of the "right kind of people"
for their daughters.

40:21.166 --> 40:22.198
That's not true.

40:22.200 --> 40:23.566
I think it is.

40:23.568 --> 40:25.734
That's why your father
offered me a job.

40:25.736 --> 40:27.836
He did?

40:27.838 --> 40:29.671
Jack, that's wonderful.

40:29.673 --> 40:31.706
That-- that proves
that he really likes you.

40:31.708 --> 40:33.407
No, elizabeth,
it proves

40:33.409 --> 40:35.008
That I'm not good enough for him
as who I am.

40:35.010 --> 40:36.042
Did he say that?

40:36.044 --> 40:37.877
Didn't have to.

40:39.713 --> 40:42.381
Look, jack, my father
is a very generous man

40:42.383 --> 40:43.582
And I believe
he thinks

40:43.584 --> 40:45.216
He's offering you
a good opportunity.

40:45.218 --> 40:46.717
Tell me, elizabeth.

40:46.719 --> 40:49.352
Can you see me as an executive
in your father's company?

40:49.354 --> 40:52.021
Why not?

40:52.023 --> 40:54.523
I think you should
at least consider it.

40:54.525 --> 40:56.324
Sorry, elizabeth,

40:56.326 --> 40:58.025
But I'm not gonna
change who I am

40:58.027 --> 41:00.093
To fit in to your family.

41:01.261 --> 41:03.829
I didn't ask you to.

41:05.331 --> 41:07.665
[â™ª]

41:08.867 --> 41:11.101
Where are you going?

41:11.103 --> 41:13.236
My seat's in coach.

41:13.238 --> 41:14.537
I have a first-class
compartment.

41:14.539 --> 41:15.538
You should ride with me.

41:15.540 --> 41:18.207
Thanks.

41:18.209 --> 41:21.076
But I got some thinking to do
on the ride home.

41:22.278 --> 41:24.746
[â™ª]

41:32.987 --> 41:37.023
[â™ª]
