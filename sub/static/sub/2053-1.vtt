04:24.542 --> 04:25.334
Don't be afraid, my dear.

04:25.501 --> 04:26.584
Is there a problem?

04:27.959 --> 04:28.917
There is a woman wants to rob my daughter.

04:29.084 --> 04:30.459
Please help me.

04:33.792 --> 04:36.626
Don't worry, you're safe here with me.

04:38.501 --> 04:40.626
I just read in the newspaper,

04:40.834 --> 04:43.626
an old woman and her grandchild...

04:43.792 --> 04:45.751
...were being chased by a violent man.

04:46.626 --> 04:47.626
Hush! Quiet.

04:47.792 --> 04:49.626
Then some nice security guards...

04:49.792 --> 04:51.376
...chased the man away.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.167
But guess what?

04:55.709 --> 04:57.084
The man turned out...

04:57.251 --> 04:58.751
...to be the child's real father,

04:59.417 --> 05:02.626
while the old lady was a kidnapper.

05:06.501 --> 05:07.542
What are you saying?

05:09.042 --> 05:10.167
How do I know if

05:10.334 --> 05:12.751
this girl is your daughter?

05:16.334 --> 05:18.167
Of course she is my daughter.

05:21.251 --> 05:23.334
This is our picture together.

05:25.084 --> 05:27.376
Look closely at the woman in the picture.

05:37.501 --> 05:38.667
What...?

05:38.834 --> 05:41.167
Read this article.

05:46.501 --> 05:47.459
Do you remember?

05:48.167 --> 05:49.709
This newspaper is from twenty years ago.

05:50.001 --> 05:51.709
(Negligent mother runs over her child)

05:56.709 --> 05:58.501
Rui Rui, come here.

06:31.167 --> 06:32.292
Remember now?

06:32.917 --> 06:35.501
This is you from twenty years ago.

06:43.417 --> 06:46.417
Time to let go.

06:47.792 --> 06:50.084
The mistake we made,

06:51.209 --> 06:52.667
let me bear it alone.

06:58.501 --> 06:59.584
I'm sorry.

07:03.251 --> 07:07.417
Rui Rui has already forgiven you in the past.

07:30.709 --> 07:32.292
Mommy promises you,

07:33.209 --> 07:35.126
I will live on.

07:55.417 --> 07:56.584
Now listen to my count-

07:57.126 --> 07:58.042
One.

07:58.542 --> 07:59.334
Two.

07:59.876 --> 08:00.876
Three.

08:25.001 --> 08:28.251
Do you still see Rui Rui now?

08:33.376 --> 08:34.958
I remember now,

08:36.501 --> 08:38.208
she is gone.

08:44.542 --> 08:49.834
Dr. Xu, you have been treating me for six months.

08:51.167 --> 08:54.334
Why don't I recognize you in my dream?

08:57.876 --> 09:01.376
Hypnotherapy... the best thing about it is that...

09:01.542 --> 09:04.876
...it allows the patient to forget...

09:05.042 --> 09:07.542
...that you are their doctor during therapy.

09:07.709 --> 09:09.501
This helps the treatment.

09:09.667 --> 09:11.626
But the subject

09:11.792 --> 09:13.167
you just saw,

09:13.334 --> 09:16.584
...is still a subject accepting
instructions while in a trance.

09:17.167 --> 09:19.417
Today we will talk about Waking Hypnosis.

09:21.417 --> 09:23.126
Actually Waking Hypnosis is very simple.

09:23.292 --> 09:25.042
Right now, as I speak to you,

09:25.209 --> 09:27.501
it's possible that you have already entered...

09:27.667 --> 09:29.417
...into a trance inducted by me.

09:30.626 --> 09:32.751
In fact, from the moment
you walked into this hall,

09:32.917 --> 09:35.542
I have hypnotized you all.

09:35.709 --> 09:37.084
Now, one, two, three.

09:38.959 --> 09:39.876
OK, I didn't hypnotize you.

09:40.042 --> 09:41.167
Let's look at the screen.

09:42.917 --> 09:45.167
What do you think when you see this color?

09:46.084 --> 09:46.917
Fire.

09:48.084 --> 09:50.167
China. Red flag. Flame.

09:50.792 --> 09:51.792
Blood.

09:51.959 --> 09:52.876
OK, next.

09:54.334 --> 09:55.292
Corn.

09:57.001 --> 09:58.626
Sunflower. Sunshine.

09:58.792 --> 10:00.126
Bananas. Pineapple.

10:00.292 --> 10:01.709
Yes, all you can eat.

10:02.126 --> 10:03.001
Next.

10:04.251 --> 10:05.126
McDonald's!

10:05.542 --> 10:06.626
Correct!

10:08.751 --> 10:09.501
Studies show that most

10:09.667 --> 10:12.292
of the time, most of us...

10:12.459 --> 10:15.209
...receive "waking suggestion" from advertisements

10:15.376 --> 10:18.834
Waking Suggestion is the basis of Waking Hypnosis.

10:19.417 --> 10:20.417
My university classmates

10:20.584 --> 10:22.292
studied Waking Suggestion extensively,

10:22.459 --> 10:25.376
now they all end up in advertising.

10:27.292 --> 10:28.126
Girl over there,

10:28.292 --> 10:29.042
Dr. Xu,

10:29.209 --> 10:32.834
from what I know, hypnotherapy
has always been controversial...

10:33.001 --> 10:34.126
...because the patient is not

10:34.292 --> 10:36.792
treated out of his own will.

10:36.959 --> 10:38.751
Why don't we just use...

10:38.917 --> 10:41.376
...a more straightforward method of therapy?

10:45.084 --> 10:47.126
If you have problems, do you tell your parents?

10:47.292 --> 10:48.209
I talk to my dad.

10:48.376 --> 10:49.917
Do you talk to your best friend?

10:50.084 --> 10:50.834
Yes.

10:51.626 --> 10:53.667
What if you go home one day...

10:53.834 --> 10:55.334
...and see your dad and your best friend...

10:55.501 --> 10:56.501
...lying in bed together.

10:56.667 --> 10:57.709
Who will you talk to then?

11:00.626 --> 11:01.834
Don't laugh.

11:02.334 --> 11:05.501
Over one million people
die from suicide every year,

11:06.001 --> 11:07.126
do they have no parent,

11:07.292 --> 11:08.667
best friend and relatives,

11:08.834 --> 11:10.501
no buddies to talk to?

11:10.709 --> 11:12.542
The problem is they can't talk about it.

11:13.584 --> 11:15.334
Some patients don't want to talk...

11:15.501 --> 11:18.792
...and some patients don't even know how.

11:19.542 --> 11:20.917
I am a doctor,

11:21.459 --> 11:23.334
to be precise I am a psychiatrist,

11:23.792 --> 11:25.792
I don't just chat with patients.

11:26.376 --> 11:27.209
I treat them.

11:27.376 --> 11:29.959
My job is to cure them,

11:30.126 --> 11:33.001
I don't care what method
I use as long as it works.

11:33.167 --> 11:34.126
How do I know that

11:34.292 --> 11:36.126
when a doctor hypnotizes me,

11:36.292 --> 11:39.376
he is helping me instead of harming me?

11:41.709 --> 11:42.584
Don't worry,

11:42.751 --> 11:44.876
there are more than 300 people here today,

11:45.042 --> 11:46.459
you're absolutely safe.

11:46.667 --> 11:47.584
Wake up.

11:52.084 --> 11:53.584
You gave a good speech,

11:54.084 --> 11:56.417
but you are the same as you were in university-

11:56.584 --> 11:58.626
short temper, sharp tongue.

11:59.501 --> 12:00.334
Professor Fang,

12:00.501 --> 12:03.667
you're not here today just to scold me, right?

12:04.417 --> 12:07.042
I have a patient, it's a peculiar case.

12:07.209 --> 12:08.376
I'd like to refer her to you.

12:09.376 --> 12:10.417
Her name is Ren Xiaoyan.

12:10.584 --> 12:12.542
She was adopted by a Hong Kong couple...

12:12.709 --> 12:14.584
...at a local orphanage
when she was six years old.

12:14.751 --> 12:16.417
She lives in Hong Kong now.

12:16.709 --> 12:18.751
A few years ago,
she started to have this condition.

12:18.917 --> 12:21.209
She consulted many doctors but it didn't go away.

12:21.376 --> 12:24.167
Her foster parents are friends with my husband,

12:24.334 --> 12:25.792
so they asked me for help.

12:25.959 --> 12:28.959
But I feel you're more suitable than me.

12:29.126 --> 12:30.209
What's her condition?

12:31.167 --> 12:32.792
Heard of "I can see dead people"?

12:32.959 --> 12:34.167
Delusion?

12:34.751 --> 12:37.251
I wouldn't be here if it's that simple.

12:37.792 --> 12:40.709
I arranged Dr. Shen Li
to treat her first in Hong Kong,

12:40.876 --> 12:43.667
Shen Li says this patient is extremely logical,

12:43.834 --> 12:46.292
her story has no flaws whatsoever.

12:46.459 --> 12:47.959
This surprised Shen.

12:49.459 --> 12:52.167
I'm surprised Shen even got her license.

12:53.251 --> 12:54.834
There you go again.

13:08.792 --> 13:10.001
If you are OK with this,

13:10.167 --> 13:11.959
I will arrange an appointment as soon as possible.

13:17.501 --> 13:18.542
Are you OK?

13:20.334 --> 13:21.167
Uh... yeah.

13:21.501 --> 13:22.667
There is a restaurant...

13:23.542 --> 13:24.834
“.nearby.

13:26.001 --> 13:26.751
We can...

13:26.917 --> 13:28.376
...just walk there.

13:28.792 --> 13:29.834
Let's go eat.

13:39.042 --> 13:40.084
When I was a child,

13:41.251 --> 13:42.501
my father often beat my mum.

13:43.167 --> 13:45.167
Whenever he was dunk,

13:45.334 --> 13:47.292
my mum hid me into the big wardrobe...

13:51.042 --> 13:51.876
Doctor,

13:52.834 --> 13:54.959
I don't know if I can talk about it...

13:59.917 --> 14:01.001
Dr. Xu.

14:02.126 --> 14:03.042
Come in.

14:12.709 --> 14:14.209
Why are they still renovating?

14:15.376 --> 14:16.959
I asked the carpenters,

14:17.126 --> 14:18.667
they will finish soon.

14:20.667 --> 14:21.876
Your coffee.

14:24.626 --> 14:25.626
You can go now.

14:26.876 --> 14:28.459
You have one more patient today.

14:29.042 --> 14:31.001
One more? I thought there were four today.

14:31.542 --> 14:33.667
Ren Xiaoyan, referred by Professor Fang,

14:33.834 --> 14:35.042
she says you know.

14:36.167 --> 14:37.251
I remember now.

14:42.584 --> 14:43.584
Where's her picture?

14:44.251 --> 14:45.084
I don't know.

14:45.251 --> 14:47.376
This was just sent over from Dr. Shen Li.

14:53.459 --> 14:55.167
The patient has been
waiting outside for some time.

15:01.042 --> 15:01.959
Let her come in.

15:02.334 --> 15:03.209
OK.

15:09.417 --> 15:11.584
Miss Ren, you can go in now.

15:13.792 --> 15:14.876
Miss Ren...

15:51.292 --> 15:51.917
Excuse me, Miss Ren...

15:52.084 --> 15:53.126
Hush“.

15:53.959 --> 15:55.292
Listen to the clock-

16:00.126 --> 16:01.626
something's wrong with the sound.

16:02.709 --> 16:04.167
Maybe a mechanical problem,

16:04.542 --> 16:05.334
I'll get it fixed tomorrow.

16:05.501 --> 16:06.667
I see

16:07.834 --> 16:09.209
it's slow.

16:22.959 --> 16:24.126
Nice to meet you for the first time,

16:24.292 --> 16:25.501
my name is Ren Xiaoyan.

16:27.376 --> 16:29.042
Nice to meet you, come with me.

16:57.709 --> 17:00.042
Sorry, no smoking here.

17:11.626 --> 17:13.209
Wait a minute, I'll be right back.

17:29.251 --> 17:30.251
Where are you going?

17:31.751 --> 17:32.667
Nobody has lived here for years,

17:32.834 --> 17:34.376
why must they renovate tonight?

17:34.542 --> 17:36.792
It's affecting my work, tell them to stop!

17:37.584 --> 17:38.584
OK.

17:42.917 --> 17:44.167
Shen Li, it's me.

17:45.251 --> 17:46.292
Ruining.

17:46.459 --> 17:48.084
You're not already in bed, are you?

17:49.084 --> 17:51.917
I just put my baby to bed, what's up?

17:53.459 --> 17:55.251
I have a patient referred by you,

17:55.417 --> 17:57.584
her name is Ren Xiaoyan.

17:57.751 --> 17:58.751
Do you remember her?

18:03.876 --> 18:04.876
Hello?

18:06.251 --> 18:07.042
What?

18:07.209 --> 18:09.751
Ruining, listen to me,

18:10.459 --> 18:13.501
I know Professor Fang arranged this,

18:14.126 --> 18:15.459
but I must tell you,

18:15.626 --> 18:17.251
there is something wrong with this woman.

18:17.626 --> 18:19.917
Miss Ren, you look good.

18:20.501 --> 18:21.501
Sleeping well recently?

18:21.667 --> 18:22.834
Not really,

18:23.209 --> 18:24.459
I can't sleep sometimes.

18:26.667 --> 18:27.834
Don't be nervous,

18:28.917 --> 18:30.126
let's just have a chat.

18:31.417 --> 18:33.459
Relax, tell me what kind of
pressure you're having.

18:33.626 --> 18:34.667
Dr. Shen,

18:35.667 --> 18:38.126
is it tiring to pretend to
care about your patients?

18:39.792 --> 18:41.292
No matter how hard you try,

18:41.959 --> 18:44.376
you're still looking at me like I'm a patient.

18:46.584 --> 18:48.792
Miss Ren, I think there is a misunderstanding.

18:48.959 --> 18:50.251
No, you misunderstand me.

18:50.667 --> 18:51.834
I'm not sick.

19:14.084 --> 19:15.417
Dr. Shen, you know?

19:17.001 --> 19:18.501
Every abandoned child...

19:19.501 --> 19:22.001
...will do anything to look for his real parents.

19:23.501 --> 19:24.792
Once he finds them,

19:25.834 --> 19:27.459
he will never let go.

19:30.084 --> 19:31.751
Maybe you were a little over-sensitive?

19:32.001 --> 19:33.584
Before I had Baby,

19:33.751 --> 19:35.917
I was pregnant once, but I had an abortion.

19:36.084 --> 19:39.334
So I felt really weird how could she know?

19:39.584 --> 19:40.876
Maybe

19:41.626 --> 19:43.709
she found some clues,

19:44.376 --> 19:46.376
or maybe she's just talking about herself.

19:47.126 --> 19:49.251
Isn't she an orphan?

19:49.667 --> 19:51.209
I don't want to think about this anymore.

19:51.709 --> 19:55.167
But... none of the doctors could help her,

19:55.334 --> 19:56.751
I advise you to give up.

19:56.917 --> 19:58.709
Don't worry, I know what I'm doing.

19:58.876 --> 20:00.459
Thanks for your time, goodnight.

20:04.417 --> 20:09.709
(ORPHAN) ('GHOST') (Treatment failed)

20:17.084 --> 20:18.126
Mo, it's me.

20:18.626 --> 20:20.084
I just remembered that...

20:20.251 --> 20:21.584
...you told me that your sister's husband...

20:21.751 --> 20:24.667
...used to work for childcare services, right?

20:45.792 --> 20:46.751
I'm sorry...

20:47.959 --> 20:49.417
...to keep you waiting.

20:58.292 --> 20:59.709
Miss Ren, you...

20:59.876 --> 21:00.917
I'm not sick.

21:03.459 --> 21:04.417
You're very sensitive.

21:04.584 --> 21:06.126
You would be sensitive too...

21:07.001 --> 21:08.459
...if you could see what I see.

21:42.667 --> 21:43.959
What are you looking at?

21:53.417 --> 21:55.501
Would you like to talk about yourself?

21:56.334 --> 21:57.584
You wouldn't believe me even if I did,

21:58.334 --> 21:59.834
why waste my time?

22:03.792 --> 22:05.501
Just because I took a consultation fee...

22:06.042 --> 22:09.834
...doesn't mean that I have to
believe everything you say.

22:11.834 --> 22:13.876
You have no idea what I'm facing.

22:15.042 --> 22:16.542
You mean "ghosts", right?

22:18.584 --> 22:20.334
I don't believe in ghosts, period.

22:23.042 --> 22:24.667
So you think I'm crazy too,

22:25.334 --> 22:26.542
you are just like the rest of them.

22:26.876 --> 22:28.709
Oh no, I'm more expensive than all of them.

22:29.459 --> 22:32.376
But... since I have sold you my time,

22:33.209 --> 22:35.001
you can try to persuade me.

22:35.167 --> 22:36.876
Sometimes a brilliant lie...

22:37.542 --> 22:39.209
...is more believable than the truth.

22:57.542 --> 22:58.709
Dr. Xu,

23:00.751 --> 23:02.417
have you ever heard sounds of marbles...

23:03.751 --> 23:06.251
...coming from the ceiling when you sleep?

23:54.251 --> 23:55.959
There are many explanations...

23:56.126 --> 23:57.459
...for hearing marble noises from the ceiling.

23:58.292 --> 23:59.959
Could be the pipes misbehaving...

24:00.834 --> 24:04.292
...or just thermal expansion and
contraction of the building.

24:05.334 --> 24:08.792
I think... you should finish listening to my story.

24:10.126 --> 24:11.584
Please continue.

24:59.251 --> 25:00.501
It's here...

25:02.376 --> 25:03.667
Granny Li.

25:04.251 --> 25:05.709
Granny Li, is that you?

25:17.251 --> 25:18.042
Miss Ren.

25:18.209 --> 25:19.292
Where's Uncle Zhang?

25:20.417 --> 25:22.667
Uncle Zhang, that noise upstairs...

25:28.084 --> 25:32.209
Miss Ren, are we disturbing you?

25:39.209 --> 25:40.417
But I...

25:42.042 --> 25:46.542
This morning I saw her lying on the floor,

25:47.376 --> 25:48.751
the doctor says...

25:48.917 --> 25:51.542
...she had brain hemorrhage.

25:51.751 --> 25:52.876
Miss Ren.

25:55.251 --> 25:57.751
Can you stop for a minute?

25:58.209 --> 25:59.334
I'd like to, Dad.

26:01.251 --> 26:02.626
But Morn hid the house deeds,

26:02.792 --> 26:04.251
her seals and bankbooks,

26:04.417 --> 26:05.626
she hid them all.

26:06.251 --> 26:08.001
We have to find them.

26:09.209 --> 26:10.459
Hey...

26:12.084 --> 26:13.459
I have no idea...

26:14.209 --> 26:16.876
We need them to sort put the legal tomorrow,

26:17.042 --> 26:18.209
that's why we have to find them.

26:18.376 --> 26:20.001
Did you look under the bed?

26:20.667 --> 26:21.709
Yes,

26:22.126 --> 26:23.584
we looked everywhere,

26:24.042 --> 26:25.084
but didn't find anything.

26:25.751 --> 26:27.209
Then I won't bother you any more.

26:40.751 --> 26:43.084
What's up there?

26:44.001 --> 26:45.334
Deserted air vent.

26:50.001 --> 26:51.501
It's here...

26:52.417 --> 26:53.792
It's right here...

26:56.459 --> 26:58.209
I think what you're looking for...

27:00.334 --> 27:01.667
...may be up there.

27:22.417 --> 27:23.751
Everything is here.

27:24.501 --> 27:25.376
Look,

27:25.792 --> 27:28.501
family certificates, house deeds,

27:29.042 --> 27:30.251
and mom's personal seals.

27:33.001 --> 27:33.959
And this bracelet,

27:34.126 --> 27:36.501
no wonder Morn hasn't worn it for days.

27:37.084 --> 27:38.417
She hid it up there,

27:39.042 --> 27:41.001
but how did she get up there?

27:54.459 --> 27:56.667
That secret chamber must be quite high...

27:56.834 --> 27:58.334
...to be able to hide a person?

28:00.042 --> 28:02.417
Did I say that I saw a person?

28:09.209 --> 28:10.751
Dejavu

28:12.376 --> 28:14.417
You think I saw something...

28:14.584 --> 28:16.376
...and then I made up a story, right?

28:18.501 --> 28:20.417
You are not the first doctor who thinks this way.

28:22.709 --> 28:25.792
Why can't it be a dream or a coincidence?

28:26.459 --> 28:28.709
Why are you so sure it's a ghost?

28:30.709 --> 28:32.376
It's not important what I saw,

28:33.584 --> 28:35.751
the question is why do I see them.

28:37.167 --> 28:38.209
Them?

28:38.376 --> 28:39.709
More than one?

28:40.792 --> 28:43.084
I didn't say I just saw once.

28:45.834 --> 28:47.251
All right, then tell me more...

28:47.792 --> 28:51.417
...about your most recent encounter with them.

28:54.667 --> 28:57.501
I remember that it was my birthday,

28:58.417 --> 29:00.001
I was out drinking with friends and it got late.

29:30.042 --> 29:31.042
What's the matter, driver?

29:32.209 --> 29:34.584
Nothing, It will be fixed soon.

29:43.376 --> 29:45.792
Actually my house is just over there, I can walk.

29:57.167 --> 29:58.459
Don't get off the bus, OK?

29:59.126 --> 30:00.251
I'll fix it real soon.

30:01.001 --> 30:02.459
Real soon.

30:03.709 --> 30:05.959
I want to get off, please open the door.

30:33.876 --> 30:36.001
Sorry, are you all right?

30:37.334 --> 30:38.917
Little girl, are you hurt?

30:50.501 --> 30:52.334
Why are you here by yourself?

30:58.584 --> 31:00.042
Where are your parents?

31:09.292 --> 31:11.292
Miss, the bus is fine now,

31:11.459 --> 31:12.959
do you want to get back on?

31:13.667 --> 31:16.042
It's all right, I can walk home.

31:18.709 --> 31:19.667
What is it?

31:20.417 --> 31:21.501
Can I help you?

31:22.042 --> 31:22.834
Nothing,

31:23.001 --> 31:24.959
I can walk home by myself, thank you.

31:47.876 --> 31:51.376
What was the bus's license plate number?

31:52.417 --> 31:54.251
84N16.

31:57.001 --> 31:58.334
Good memory.

32:00.876 --> 32:02.501
You think I made it up?

32:03.292 --> 32:05.292
If it happened to you,

32:05.459 --> 32:06.917
you would remember it well too.

32:07.959 --> 32:11.376
Miss Ren, do you know what is a "montage"?

32:11.917 --> 32:13.417
All these things you encountered...

32:13.917 --> 32:15.917
...may be unrelated to each other,

32:16.084 --> 32:18.542
but because they happened around the same time,

32:18.709 --> 32:19.792
so your brain edited them together
like a movie montage,

32:19.959 --> 32:22.417
so your brain edited them together
like a movie montage,

32:22.584 --> 32:25.042
and gave them connection and meaning.

32:26.459 --> 32:28.126
You think the driver is strange,

32:28.626 --> 32:31.542
but it may be that he's
just in a hurry to get home.

32:32.459 --> 32:33.459
And that little girl

32:34.001 --> 32:35.751
could've got on the bus...

32:35.917 --> 32:37.251
...while you were talking to the driver,

32:38.376 --> 32:41.126
or maybe she was already on the bus.

32:45.834 --> 32:48.417
I know I was the only one on the bus.

32:53.167 --> 32:54.667
Stop taking notes, OK?

32:55.917 --> 32:57.917
You are the most impatient psychiatrist

32:58.084 --> 32:59.167
I have ever met.

33:00.084 --> 33:01.501
Have you met a lot of psychiatrists?

33:01.667 --> 33:03.167
More than you can imagine.

33:03.334 --> 33:06.209
Then you know that patience
is not the only virtue.

33:13.167 --> 33:14.917
OK, please continue.

33:17.376 --> 33:18.667
Watch the road!

33:41.417 --> 33:44.584
(WANTED: Car responsible for
hit-and-run accident)

33:49.251 --> 33:53.667
Are you saying that the bus driver
is the murderer?

34:03.584 --> 34:07.167
This case was solved and even made the news.

34:09.083 --> 34:11.501
(Anonymous tip solves case)

34:15.626 --> 34:17.626
Then how do I know you didn't
just make up the story...

34:17.792 --> 34:19.208
...from reading the news article?

34:21.708 --> 34:23.083
Do you have some evidence proving...

34:23.251 --> 34:25.626
...that it was you who called the police?

34:29.708 --> 34:31.251
I used a public phone,

34:31.958 --> 34:33.333
how could I have evidence?

34:42.708 --> 34:44.917
(March 5, 2013)

34:50.333 --> 34:53.083
This story works...

34:53.251 --> 34:54.376
...with or without ghosts.

34:56.376 --> 34:57.376
Dr. Xu,

34:58.251 --> 34:59.459
that's what I said,

35:00.209 --> 35:01.626
it's not important what I saw,

35:03.126 --> 35:05.084
the issue is why I saw them.

35:09.292 --> 35:12.709
Miss Ren, let's talk about yourself...

35:13.292 --> 35:14.751
...if you don't mind.

35:19.251 --> 35:20.167
I do mind.

35:21.042 --> 35:23.126
What's your relationship
with your foster parents like?

35:24.167 --> 35:25.459
What's it to you?

35:26.209 --> 35:28.084
They take you to see psychiatrists all over,

35:28.584 --> 35:29.959
you already hate them for it,

35:30.501 --> 35:32.542
so you come here with antagonism towards me.

35:33.292 --> 35:34.751
You really are full of yourself, aren't you?

35:35.792 --> 35:37.792
I know you are here not to solve your problem...

35:37.959 --> 35:39.376
...but just to placate them.

35:40.459 --> 35:41.751
Unfortunately,

35:41.917 --> 35:43.001
I never allow my patients...

35:43.167 --> 35:45.376
...to leave this room uncured.

35:46.084 --> 35:48.084
I will use extreme methods if necessary.

35:48.792 --> 35:51.001
So either you tell the truth,

35:51.167 --> 35:53.084
or I will make you tell the truth.

35:53.792 --> 35:55.917
So this is how you treat your patients.

35:56.084 --> 35:58.751
I know very well how to treat my patients.

36:03.501 --> 36:04.667
Have you ever tried...

36:05.751 --> 36:07.209
...to understand your foster parents?

36:08.834 --> 36:10.459
See from their point of view?

36:11.834 --> 36:13.376
Running away won't solve anything.

36:14.709 --> 36:16.542
If you care about them at all,

36:17.292 --> 36:18.542
please work with me,

36:18.709 --> 36:20.209
let's start from your life story.

36:23.917 --> 36:25.042
Because“.

36:26.167 --> 36:29.042
...you can't always use
being an orphan as an excuse.

36:53.542 --> 36:54.917
When I was four,

36:55.917 --> 36:57.876
my biological parents took me
to the amusement park.

37:00.917 --> 37:02.084
Slow down.

37:57.626 --> 38:00.126
I will always remember
the red flowers on the ground...

38:00.834 --> 38:02.542
...and the cotton fibers floating in the air.

38:08.792 --> 38:10.167
Later did I know that...

38:11.042 --> 38:14.292
...the letter was their suicide note.

38:17.126 --> 38:19.876
What did they write?

38:20.459 --> 38:22.792
They owed a lot of money and had no way out.

38:23.459 --> 38:25.667
So you feel abandoned by them.

38:28.001 --> 38:29.417
How is that abandonment?

38:30.126 --> 38:32.042
They left me alive because they loved me.

38:34.167 --> 38:37.334
Do you remember your biological parents' names?

38:37.501 --> 38:38.834
My father's name is Ren Jianguo,

38:39.001 --> 38:40.376
my mother's name is He Qin.

38:41.209 --> 38:42.417
Ren?

38:43.584 --> 38:45.709
You didn't adopt your foster father's last name?

38:46.251 --> 38:47.751
They wanted to change my name,

38:47.917 --> 38:49.334
but I never agreed.

38:49.501 --> 38:50.917
So that was that.

38:51.792 --> 38:54.334
Do you remember where you lived as a child?

38:54.501 --> 38:55.376
Nandu City.

38:56.042 --> 38:57.584
I have been back there,

38:57.751 --> 38:59.042
but I couldn't find any clues,

38:59.209 --> 39:00.917
not even my birth certificate.

39:03.042 --> 39:05.376
So you're from the south?

39:06.542 --> 39:08.376
Your parents got into financial trouble...

39:08.542 --> 39:11.792
...and they took you all the way to the north,

39:12.709 --> 39:15.626
just to abandon you.

39:17.459 --> 39:18.376
Come in.

39:19.042 --> 39:20.542
Sorry to disturb you.

39:23.001 --> 39:24.501
This is from Mr. Mo.

39:37.876 --> 39:39.251
Off to see more documents?

39:40.167 --> 39:41.834
I need to go to the bathroom.

39:42.167 --> 39:43.459
In and out, in and out...

39:43.626 --> 39:45.376
how can you make your patients trust you?

39:45.542 --> 39:47.626
You never trusted me anyway.

39:54.334 --> 39:55.501
Mo, it's me.

39:55.667 --> 39:56.917
I got the documents.

39:57.251 --> 39:58.292
Did you find anything?

39:59.459 --> 40:01.626
Pretty much the same.

40:01.792 --> 40:03.626
I just want to ask you-

40:03.792 --> 40:05.084
if you know what kind

40:05.251 --> 40:07.084
of tree has cotton fibers...

40:07.251 --> 40:10.876
...or red flowers in March?

40:11.126 --> 40:13.084
It sounds like the Red Silk Cotton Flower,

40:13.251 --> 40:14.751
but it's from the south.

40:14.917 --> 40:16.167
It doesn't grow in the north.

40:16.626 --> 40:17.876
Do they grow in Nandu City?

40:18.042 --> 40:21.084
Of course, it is the City flower.

40:44.751 --> 40:45.667
Mo,

40:46.626 --> 40:48.251
I need to ask you something else.

40:48.417 --> 40:49.376
Okay.

40:50.876 --> 40:51.792
Hello?

40:52.626 --> 40:54.042
Ruining?

40:54.459 --> 40:55.417
Are you okay?

40:56.126 --> 40:59.209
Get back to me later.

41:42.501 --> 41:43.792
Need help?

41:53.876 --> 41:55.792
Let's get back to our topic,

41:56.542 --> 41:58.542
let's talk about your foster parents.

42:00.209 --> 42:02.084
How is your relationship with them?

42:02.876 --> 42:05.542
Pretty good, they've been good to me.

42:07.376 --> 42:08.459
But...

42:09.042 --> 42:10.334
...deep down inside...

42:11.084 --> 42:12.167
You can't let go.

42:13.709 --> 42:15.542
You're afraid that if
you love your foster parents,

42:15.709 --> 42:18.376
then you've betrayed your biological parents.

42:21.209 --> 42:22.751
But have you thought about

42:23.251 --> 42:25.542
another answer to your story?

42:26.876 --> 42:29.001
The key is whether you want the real truth...

42:29.417 --> 42:32.334
...or just the truth you believe.

42:34.251 --> 42:35.584
What do you mean?

42:38.501 --> 42:40.167
If you can trust me,

42:41.417 --> 42:43.667
I hope you can cooperate further.

42:45.167 --> 42:46.167
How?

42:46.917 --> 42:48.667
Have you heard of hypnotherapy?

42:50.084 --> 42:51.667
Don't be nervous.

42:52.376 --> 42:53.751
First, just relax,

42:54.542 --> 42:56.584
and adjust your breathing.

42:57.417 --> 43:00.542
Focus on my watch.

43:01.959 --> 43:03.542
Gaze into it,

43:09.626 --> 43:10.959
and then I will count to three-

43:12.959 --> 43:13.917
One...

43:17.501 --> 43:18.626
Two...

43:35.292 --> 43:36.834
Am I hypnotized?

43:37.042 --> 43:38.084
Three!

44:11.667 --> 44:12.834
Hold this...

44:13.292 --> 44:14.542
Hold this tight...

44:14.834 --> 44:16.167
Xiaoyan, what have you got there?

44:18.167 --> 44:19.042
Come, show me.

44:19.209 --> 44:20.834
Why are you here by yourself?

44:23.542 --> 44:24.917
It's here...

44:25.876 --> 44:27.542
It's here...

44:28.376 --> 44:29.084
It's right here...

44:29.251 --> 44:30.584
Little girl, are you hurt?

44:30.751 --> 44:31.334
It's right here...

44:31.501 --> 44:32.709
Where are your parents?

44:42.417 --> 44:43.376
Just relax...

44:43.542 --> 44:44.459
Relax,

44:45.292 --> 44:47.209
nothing can hurt you.

44:48.876 --> 44:50.209
Good.

44:51.626 --> 44:53.417
Now you see a door,

44:55.542 --> 44:58.001
the answer you are looking for
is behind that door.

44:58.876 --> 45:00.667
Now open the door slowly.

45:02.251 --> 45:03.917
I am afraid to open it.

45:05.167 --> 45:07.209
Don't worry, you are completely safe.

45:08.376 --> 45:09.584
Tell me-

45:09.751 --> 45:11.459
what does the door look like?

45:11.959 --> 45:13.167
Very old...

45:14.126 --> 45:15.626
Very ancient...

45:17.084 --> 45:18.917
I think I have seen it before.

45:19.834 --> 45:22.751
Don't be afraid, open the door.

45:26.251 --> 45:28.417
Tell me what's behind the door...

45:42.834 --> 45:45.042
What do you see now?

45:46.126 --> 45:47.459
Water...

45:47.626 --> 45:49.084
Water?

45:49.917 --> 45:51.334
What's in the water?

45:53.084 --> 45:54.876
I can't see anything in the water.

45:55.667 --> 45:57.334
Do you see anyone?

45:58.459 --> 45:59.417
No.

46:01.626 --> 46:04.542
Look closely, look around you.

46:05.251 --> 46:06.626
Do you see anyone?

46:14.876 --> 46:16.084
Sorry...

46:24.959 --> 46:26.167
Who do you see?

46:26.959 --> 46:27.959
It's...

46:29.667 --> 46:31.042
It's not me.

46:33.167 --> 46:36.792
Don't come for me, I can't help you.

46:37.584 --> 46:39.334
You're already dead.

46:39.501 --> 46:41.334
Please forgive me.

46:44.126 --> 46:45.709
Can you hear my voice?

46:46.959 --> 46:48.417
There is a door beside you,

46:49.001 --> 46:50.292
if you can't take it anymore,

46:50.459 --> 46:51.834
push that door and you will come back.

46:52.417 --> 46:54.126
Is it 502?

46:59.834 --> 47:01.417
Don't focus on the number.

47:02.542 --> 47:04.709
If you want to come back, open the door.

47:06.167 --> 47:08.167
I can't open it, it's locked.

47:08.334 --> 47:10.251
Don't panic.

47:10.834 --> 47:12.292
There is a key in your pocket,

47:13.001 --> 47:16.084
take it out, use it to open the door.

47:17.751 --> 47:18.834
Ren Xiaoyan?

47:19.709 --> 47:21.042
Can you still hear me?

47:21.709 --> 47:23.834
I want you to come back from that door.

47:24.417 --> 47:27.001
Hear my count of three and come back.

47:27.376 --> 47:28.251
Three...

47:28.417 --> 47:29.126
Two...

47:29.292 --> 47:31.417
I see a big lake.

47:33.751 --> 47:35.376
A big lake?

47:36.209 --> 47:37.376
What kind of lake?

47:38.167 --> 47:39.584
There is a bridge...

47:40.751 --> 47:42.084
A bridge?

48:38.709 --> 48:42.292
Sleeping on the job, professional indeed!

48:42.626 --> 48:44.334
What the hell did you do?

48:46.792 --> 48:47.751
Nothing.

48:55.834 --> 48:57.126
What did you do?

48:57.917 --> 48:59.292
I didn't do anything.

49:04.167 --> 49:05.667
You erased the tape recording!

49:06.751 --> 49:07.959
Why don't you believe me?

49:08.126 --> 49:09.292
Believe what?

49:09.459 --> 49:10.959
Believe my story and I really can see.

49:11.126 --> 49:12.126
Enough!

49:20.584 --> 49:21.584
Go.

49:25.251 --> 49:26.167
Hello?

49:27.292 --> 49:28.501
Mo.

49:29.792 --> 49:30.667
Wait a second,

49:30.834 --> 49:32.126
let me take a look.

49:35.084 --> 49:36.167
Amy, where's the fax?

49:41.834 --> 49:43.042
Have you checked with Mo?

49:43.209 --> 49:44.334
Yes I did.

49:55.709 --> 49:57.001
What did you find this time?

50:02.834 --> 50:04.334
I remember you said...

50:04.501 --> 50:05.751
...that you saw red flowers and cotton fibers...

50:06.417 --> 50:09.084
...on the day of your abandonment.

50:09.709 --> 50:11.584
I wonder how you could've seen them.

50:14.084 --> 50:15.167
From what I know,

50:15.334 --> 50:16.584
the only tree whose red flowers fall...

50:17.251 --> 50:19.001
...in that season,

50:19.167 --> 50:20.459
is the Red Silk Cotton Tree,

50:21.042 --> 50:22.834
but our Feng City, in sin the North,

50:23.459 --> 50:25.251
Red Silk Cotton flower doesn't grow here.

50:25.417 --> 50:27.792
So I wonder how you could've seen them?

50:32.709 --> 50:36.209
Ren Xiaoyan, I can tell you now with certainty-

50:36.917 --> 50:40.167
you were abandoned by Mr. and Mrs. Ren.

50:41.251 --> 50:42.542
I've said it many times,

50:43.376 --> 50:44.209
they didn't abandon me.

50:44.376 --> 50:46.334
What's more, they are not your biological parents,

50:46.501 --> 50:48.417
they are your first foster parents.

50:48.584 --> 50:50.251
This is the certificate of your adoption.

50:50.417 --> 50:51.751
It shows very clearly that

50:52.251 --> 50:53.876
on May 28, 1978,

50:54.376 --> 50:55.376
Mr. and Mrs. Ren...

50:55.542 --> 50:58.084
...adopted you from Nandu's Sanyuecao Orphanage.

50:58.251 --> 50:58.751
Nonsense!

50:58.917 --> 50:59.584
You don't remember

50:59.751 --> 51:01.917
because you were barely two years old.

51:02.751 --> 51:04.292
Ren Xiaoyan, you are an orphan.

51:04.459 --> 51:05.501
You don't have parents.

51:06.084 --> 51:07.709
You don't have a name and a birth certificate.

51:07.876 --> 51:09.084
Stop telling these lies!

51:09.417 --> 51:10.542
My parents have passed away.

51:10.709 --> 51:12.126
But actually they are still alive,

51:12.292 --> 51:15.542
and they gave birth to a son after abandoning you.

51:17.917 --> 51:19.084
How is that possible?

51:21.626 --> 51:23.084
I want you to look closely.

51:23.792 --> 51:25.126
Think hard,

51:26.042 --> 51:26.959
in the depth of your memory,

51:27.126 --> 51:27.834
(Mr. and Mrs. Ren Jianguo)

51:28.001 --> 51:31.167
where did it all begin to go wrong?

51:58.001 --> 52:00.834
The answer is inside your memory,

52:02.126 --> 52:04.042
I want you to find it again.

52:26.209 --> 52:31.126
(Nandu City)

52:47.709 --> 52:48.751
Xiaoyan,

52:49.626 --> 52:51.834
do you see it now?

52:52.834 --> 52:55.834
What you are afraid of is your real past,

52:56.001 --> 52:57.376
you never knew your parents,

52:57.542 --> 53:00.209
and you were abandoned and adopted twice.

53:00.667 --> 53:02.376
Now you can wake up.

53:02.542 --> 53:03.459
Three...

53:03.626 --> 53:04.584
Two...

53:04.751 --> 53:05.709
One...

53:19.001 --> 53:20.376
Do you remember now?

53:22.751 --> 53:24.126
But I remember so clearly...

53:24.709 --> 53:26.376
...there were red flowers on the ground.

53:27.542 --> 53:28.792
That was the first time...

53:29.376 --> 53:32.542
...you were abandoned by your real parents.

53:33.376 --> 53:35.542
But you were too young,

53:35.709 --> 53:39.501
so that memory stayed in your subconscious,

53:39.667 --> 53:40.459
leading you to believe...

53:40.626 --> 53:43.084
...that Mr. and Mrs. Ren
are your biological parents.

53:43.251 --> 53:44.084
Basically,

53:44.251 --> 53:46.084
your two memories overlapped.

53:47.834 --> 53:49.417
There must be a mistake somewhere.

53:50.209 --> 53:53.376
You have always neglected a fact in your memory...

53:53.542 --> 53:56.167
...that He Qin was already pregnant.

53:59.209 --> 54:00.959
Why would they fake suicide?

54:01.417 --> 54:03.001
Because you were adopted.

54:04.084 --> 54:06.792
Abandoning you would be against the law.

54:07.417 --> 54:09.209
Reports show that the police...

54:09.376 --> 54:11.251
...found them when you were nine,

54:11.417 --> 54:13.917
but your current foster parents
refused to give you up,

54:14.084 --> 54:15.834
so they hid the truth from you.

54:17.417 --> 54:18.501
Don't you see...

54:18.959 --> 54:21.626
...that all your ghost stories have
to do with your own life?

54:23.292 --> 54:24.626
The glass marbles,

54:25.792 --> 54:27.667
the little girl who got
separated from her parents...

54:30.709 --> 54:31.792
Miss Ren,

54:32.626 --> 54:36.417
from now on please stop lying, OK?

54:39.959 --> 54:42.001
How dare you say that I'm lying?

54:44.251 --> 54:46.417
Your birthday is March 3, right?

54:47.834 --> 54:49.251
How did you know?

54:50.126 --> 54:51.292
You just said...

54:51.917 --> 54:54.084
...you met the little girl on your birthday,

54:55.042 --> 54:57.876
and the next day you called the police,

54:58.501 --> 55:00.334
then the newspaper reported the day after.

55:00.501 --> 55:02.626
The newspaper is dated March 5,

55:02.792 --> 55:04.834
so that means your birthday is March 3.

55:06.001 --> 55:07.709
But actually you are an orphan,

55:08.209 --> 55:09.501
you can't know your year of birth,

55:09.667 --> 55:11.292
how can you know your birthday?

55:11.459 --> 55:12.376
March 3 is my birthday.

55:12.542 --> 55:13.834
I don't want to argue with you.

55:14.501 --> 55:16.126
What about your fiance?

55:17.084 --> 55:18.334
What fiance?

55:18.501 --> 55:19.917
From the moment you walked in until now,

55:20.084 --> 55:22.501
you have been touching the
middle finger on your left hand...

55:22.667 --> 55:24.001
...six times!

55:26.042 --> 55:27.626
Even though you took off the engagement ring,

55:27.792 --> 55:30.084
your body reflex didn't change.

55:31.626 --> 55:33.834
Are you afraid that I mention your fiance?

55:35.334 --> 55:36.792
What are you trying to hide?

55:37.501 --> 55:38.709
What happened to him?

55:39.292 --> 55:40.542
Can you talk about it?

55:42.417 --> 55:43.709
There's nothing to talk about.

56:10.376 --> 56:13.376
Don't be afraid, old houses are like that,

56:13.834 --> 56:15.376
the power will be back on soon.

56:17.042 --> 56:18.626
Can I have a cigarette?

56:36.376 --> 56:40.001
Miss Ren, I have been a psychiatrist for years.

56:41.251 --> 56:42.917
Let me share something with you-

56:43.792 --> 56:46.001
things that look non-important...

56:46.792 --> 56:49.084
...may be more serious than we think.

56:53.417 --> 56:54.917
It's already late today,

56:57.251 --> 56:59.209
the session is over.

57:00.042 --> 57:01.084
Please go home.

57:02.667 --> 57:03.626
That's it?

57:04.167 --> 57:05.334
Yes, that's it.

57:05.501 --> 57:06.459
Please go.

58:04.042 --> 58:05.001
Little girl.

58:43.542 --> 58:44.376
Are you ready?

58:44.542 --> 58:45.417
Ready!

58:45.584 --> 58:47.376
Hide yourselves well.

58:47.542 --> 58:49.084
Hurry up and hide.

58:50.209 --> 58:51.459
Ten

58:51.709 --> 58:52.667
Nine

58:52.834 --> 58:55.209
Eight

58:55.376 --> 58:56.501
Seven

58:56.667 --> 58:57.709
Six

58:57.876 --> 58:59.042
Five

58:59.209 --> 59:00.376
Four

59:00.542 --> 59:01.542
Three

59:01.709 --> 59:02.709
Two

59:02.876 --> 59:04.042
One

59:09.126 --> 59:10.417
Xiaoyan!

59:12.251 --> 59:13.417
Director.

59:19.292 --> 59:20.751
How is university?

59:21.001 --> 59:22.042
So far so good.

59:22.584 --> 59:24.709
I heard that you got full scholarship...

59:24.876 --> 59:26.626
...in these past few years,

59:26.792 --> 59:28.376
that's great.

59:29.584 --> 59:31.501
Even though you're so busy with grad school,

59:31.667 --> 59:33.209
you still come visit us,

59:33.792 --> 59:35.126
I'm so touched.

59:35.667 --> 59:37.001
Director Lin, please don't say that,

59:37.167 --> 59:38.501
this was my home...

59:38.667 --> 59:40.251
- ...and you are my family too.
- Uncle.

59:42.417 --> 59:43.417
Who are they?

59:43.959 --> 59:44.584
Them?

59:44.751 --> 59:46.459
Volunteers.

59:46.792 --> 59:48.751
They give us aid and supplies.

59:50.334 --> 59:51.459
His name is Luo Yusong,

59:51.626 --> 59:54.417
he came to our orphanage after you were adopted.

59:54.959 --> 59:57.209
But he never got adopted,

59:57.542 --> 59:59.626
so he grew up here.

01:00:08.751 --> 01:00:10.126
I want to tell you something-

01:00:11.292 --> 01:00:13.626
you said you didn't know your birthday,

01:00:13.792 --> 01:00:16.292
I want to give my birthday to you.

01:00:16.459 --> 01:00:17.834
From now on,

01:00:18.417 --> 01:00:20.959
every year March 3 will be both our birthday.

01:00:22.542 --> 01:00:23.876
OK, we will be late.

01:00:24.042 --> 01:00:25.959
It's your birthday,we can't be late.

01:00:27.459 --> 01:00:28.667
It's OUR birthday.

01:00:36.084 --> 01:00:38.834
I'm grateful that the orphanage
gave me a stable life.

01:00:40.167 --> 01:00:41.501
It made me realize that...

01:00:42.751 --> 01:00:44.167
...there are two kinds of family-

01:00:45.542 --> 01:00:47.001
one you're born with,

01:00:48.126 --> 01:00:52.917
and another kind is the family you earn.

01:01:10.292 --> 01:01:11.251
Xiaoyan,

01:01:13.084 --> 01:01:14.709
I want to become your family.

01:01:19.459 --> 01:01:20.542
Promise me,

01:01:22.167 --> 01:01:23.626
never ever leave me.

01:01:28.876 --> 01:01:30.001
But you know,

01:01:30.542 --> 01:01:32.376
in the end, I will have to leave you.

01:02:26.042 --> 01:02:27.084
Xiaoyan,

01:02:28.251 --> 01:02:29.751
why did I die?

01:02:35.251 --> 01:02:36.751
Why did you kill me?

01:02:37.626 --> 01:02:38.584
It's not me.

01:02:40.126 --> 01:02:41.167
It's not me.

01:02:42.126 --> 01:02:43.292
It wasn't me.

01:02:44.167 --> 01:02:45.292
It really wasn't me.

01:02:45.959 --> 01:02:47.126
Then tell me who it was.

01:02:47.292 --> 01:02:49.167
It was...

01:02:49.334 --> 01:02:50.376
Who was it?

01:02:51.084 --> 01:02:52.292
Who killed me?

01:03:09.001 --> 01:03:09.876
Xiaoyan...

01:03:12.959 --> 01:03:14.126
Ren Xiaoyan...

01:03:16.334 --> 01:03:18.042
Ren Xiaoyan...

01:03:20.376 --> 01:03:22.042
What did you see?

01:03:26.667 --> 01:03:28.084
Ren Xiaoyan...

01:03:32.459 --> 01:03:33.667
Ren Xiaoyan...

01:03:35.959 --> 01:03:37.876
How did your fiance die?

01:03:42.501 --> 01:03:44.501
Can you hear my voice?

01:04:06.417 --> 01:04:07.709
OK, I'll count to three...

01:04:08.292 --> 01:04:09.626
...and you will come back to reality.

01:04:10.251 --> 01:04:10.709
Three.

01:04:10.876 --> 01:04:11.251
Two.

01:04:11.417 --> 01:04:12.334
One.

01:04:24.584 --> 01:04:26.334
When did you hypnotize me again?

01:04:27.334 --> 01:04:29.626
You must tell me how your fiance died,

01:04:29.792 --> 01:04:31.584
so I can figure out how to help you.

01:04:39.417 --> 01:04:40.417
Sorry.

01:05:25.209 --> 01:05:26.584
Accident.

01:05:27.459 --> 01:05:28.501
What?

01:05:30.959 --> 01:05:32.126
Car crash.

01:05:37.626 --> 01:05:40.001
Were you in the car?

01:05:43.959 --> 01:05:45.709
How long ago was that?

01:05:46.584 --> 01:05:47.792
Eight years ago.

01:05:53.834 --> 01:05:57.001
Can you tell me the details?

01:06:00.542 --> 01:06:01.959
I really can't.

01:06:05.376 --> 01:06:06.542
Since the start of this session,

01:06:07.167 --> 01:06:09.917
you keep saying that you can see ghosts.

01:06:11.084 --> 01:06:13.167
See I believe what you said is true,

01:06:13.334 --> 01:06:14.876
now can I ask you a question?

01:06:15.542 --> 01:06:16.792
What question?

01:06:17.834 --> 01:06:20.667
Have you ever seen your fiance?

01:06:25.001 --> 01:06:26.042
Never.

01:06:26.959 --> 01:06:27.917
Really?

01:06:29.542 --> 01:06:30.834
If a person lies,

01:06:31.001 --> 01:06:33.417
it's because he wants to or he has to.

01:06:36.292 --> 01:06:37.334
What I'm saying is all true.

01:06:37.501 --> 01:06:39.834
You are trying to believe it's all true.

01:06:41.251 --> 01:06:43.167
Your fiance is dead.

01:06:43.667 --> 01:06:45.292
Dead people don't come back to life.

01:06:45.459 --> 01:06:46.751
What's he got to do With this?

01:06:47.376 --> 01:06:49.792
Why can't you just believe me
that I can see ghosts!

01:06:50.376 --> 01:06:51.876
Even if you really can see ghosts,

01:06:52.042 --> 01:06:52.542
you still can't

01:06:52.709 --> 01:06:54.709
bring your fiance back to life.

01:06:54.876 --> 01:06:56.709
Dead is dead.

01:06:59.501 --> 01:07:00.667
Dr. Xu,

01:07:02.501 --> 01:07:04.626
I know you're smart and confident,

01:07:05.376 --> 01:07:07.709
you flip things around to make me sound like...

01:07:07.876 --> 01:07:10.084
...I am dreaming or just delusional.

01:07:10.667 --> 01:07:13.084
I may be crazy, but I'm not stupid.

01:07:14.876 --> 01:07:16.167
Can't you believe me just once?

01:07:16.334 --> 01:07:17.542
I can believe you

01:07:17.709 --> 01:07:19.209
if you give me evidence, not stories.

01:07:19.376 --> 01:07:21.126
These are not stories.

01:07:27.084 --> 01:07:28.376
I get it.

01:07:30.334 --> 01:07:31.626
I get it now.

01:07:33.292 --> 01:07:34.417
Even if you knew...

01:07:34.584 --> 01:07:36.292
...that "seeing ghosts" is a mental illness,

01:07:36.459 --> 01:07:38.834
you don't wish to be cured, right?

01:07:42.334 --> 01:07:44.542
Because you want to see your fiance again.

01:07:49.501 --> 01:07:50.584
Ren Xiaoyan,

01:07:51.459 --> 01:07:53.667
as a psychiatrist, let me tell you-

01:07:54.542 --> 01:07:56.834
there are no ghosts in this world.

01:07:57.001 --> 01:07:58.334
People who have died,

01:07:58.501 --> 01:07:59.959
no matter how much you love them,

01:08:00.126 --> 01:08:02.417
you will never be able to see them again.

01:08:04.459 --> 01:08:05.792
Accept that...

01:08:06.751 --> 01:08:07.917
...and you will be fine.

01:08:18.876 --> 01:08:19.959
Dr. Xu,

01:08:23.001 --> 01:08:24.334
you almost convinced me.

01:08:31.626 --> 01:08:33.459
But let me ask you something.

01:08:35.709 --> 01:08:37.876
Why are there two people behind you...

01:08:41.626 --> 01:08:44.501
...since I walked into this room?

01:08:52.292 --> 01:08:54.751
Stop making up stories.

01:08:58.501 --> 01:09:00.417
Today's session is over!

01:09:00.917 --> 01:09:03.167
I really don't know why
I'm wasting my time with you.

01:09:03.501 --> 01:09:04.834
One man, one woman.

01:09:05.001 --> 01:09:07.167
The woman has long hair and almond-shaped face,

01:09:07.334 --> 01:09:09.876
her eyes penetrate with their gaze.

01:09:10.542 --> 01:09:11.792
The man,

01:09:13.542 --> 01:09:15.001
short hair, thin eyes,

01:09:15.167 --> 01:09:16.542
looks like the quiet type.

01:09:16.709 --> 01:09:17.876
Do you know them?

01:09:18.501 --> 01:09:19.667
I don't know what you're talking about,

01:09:19.834 --> 01:09:21.542
I don't know what you're trying to do.

01:09:24.042 --> 01:09:27.542
They say that your birthday is December 28.

01:09:28.459 --> 01:09:29.917
Anyone can Google my birthday.

01:09:30.459 --> 01:09:31.876
You see two people?

01:09:32.376 --> 01:09:34.292
Where are they? Where?!

01:09:36.626 --> 01:09:38.001
Didn't I tell you before?

01:09:38.626 --> 01:09:39.751
What I care...

01:09:40.376 --> 01:09:41.834
...is not why I see them,

01:09:42.792 --> 01:09:44.001
what I want to know is...

01:09:45.042 --> 01:09:47.042
...what they want from me?

01:09:54.459 --> 01:09:56.751
They also say you're afraid of water.

01:09:57.876 --> 01:09:59.209
Ridiculous!

01:09:59.376 --> 01:10:00.917
Don't you want evidence?

01:10:02.501 --> 01:10:03.751
Did you investigate me?

01:10:04.292 --> 01:10:05.417
Who sent you?

01:10:06.084 --> 01:10:07.459
Dr. Xu, you're really afraid.

01:10:07.626 --> 01:10:10.001
- Go away!
- I'm telling you I'm not lying.

01:10:10.876 --> 01:10:11.709
The two of them...

01:10:11.876 --> 01:10:13.501
...look like they just climbed out from the water.

01:10:14.126 --> 01:10:15.084
You can choose to believe or not-

01:10:15.626 --> 01:10:16.792
from the moment I walked in,

01:10:18.084 --> 01:10:19.917
they've been standing there.

01:10:28.626 --> 01:10:30.626
Look, the water is dripping from their bodies...

01:10:31.292 --> 01:10:32.251
...onto your shoulders.

01:10:32.417 --> 01:10:33.417
Enough!

01:10:37.126 --> 01:10:38.584
You don't believe me,

01:10:39.251 --> 01:10:40.334
Captain?

01:10:45.417 --> 01:10:47.501
How do you know that name?

01:10:49.584 --> 01:10:51.001
Captain...

01:10:52.334 --> 01:10:54.376
Captain...

01:11:07.959 --> 01:11:09.626
Stop calling me by that name.

01:11:10.626 --> 01:11:11.376
Listen, Captain.

01:11:11.542 --> 01:11:12.751
I don't want you to say that name!

01:11:12.917 --> 01:11:14.084
Who are you?

01:11:14.251 --> 01:11:15.292
That man says...

01:11:15.751 --> 01:11:17.626
...no matter how much you regret,
you can't bring anything back.

01:11:17.792 --> 01:11:19.667
He doesn't want to hear you say sorry anymore.

01:11:19.834 --> 01:11:21.334
I don't want to hear any of this,

01:11:21.709 --> 01:11:23.459
any of this nonsense.

01:11:23.626 --> 01:11:24.626
Whatever purpose you have,

01:11:24.792 --> 01:11:26.501
today's session is over. You know?

01:11:26.667 --> 01:11:27.334
Am)'

01:11:27.501 --> 01:11:28.584
Amy, where are you?

01:11:28.751 --> 01:11:29.876
Get out of my way.

01:11:30.542 --> 01:11:31.626
Get out!

01:11:33.042 --> 01:11:34.792
What are you trying to do with this hand?

01:11:36.001 --> 01:11:37.001
Look!

01:11:37.584 --> 01:11:39.251
Haven't your hurt enough people already?

01:11:39.834 --> 01:11:41.542
They want you to stop!

01:12:27.042 --> 01:12:28.292
The woman says that...

01:12:29.709 --> 01:12:31.167
...the question you asked her,

01:12:31.834 --> 01:12:33.001
her answer is:

01:12:33.834 --> 01:12:35.084
always.

01:12:36.959 --> 01:12:38.501
Listen Captain,

01:12:38.876 --> 01:12:39.834
they say...

01:12:40.001 --> 01:12:41.042
...they don't want to see you
hurt yourself anymore.

01:12:41.209 --> 01:12:42.417
I'm not listening!

01:12:47.751 --> 01:12:50.001
Think about the stories I told you-

01:12:50.792 --> 01:12:51.917
the car crash,

01:12:52.084 --> 01:12:53.209
the bus driver,

01:12:53.376 --> 01:12:54.792
dead people's wishes,

01:12:54.959 --> 01:12:56.126
water,

01:13:20.251 --> 01:13:21.709
You made them drink too much.

01:13:24.626 --> 01:13:25.667
Don't...

01:13:26.334 --> 01:13:27.584
Watch the road, will you!

01:13:27.751 --> 01:13:29.334
I'm fine.

01:13:29.501 --> 01:13:31.251
Your eyes are almost closed.

01:13:31.417 --> 01:13:32.209
They are not.

01:13:32.376 --> 01:13:33.959
Hold the wheel.

01:13:34.126 --> 01:13:35.584
I'm fine, I didn't drink much.

01:13:35.751 --> 01:13:37.917
Stop kidding around, you're driving!

01:13:42.417 --> 01:13:44.001
- What are you doing?
- Wake up!

01:13:44.167 --> 01:13:45.417
Wake up!

01:14:38.251 --> 01:14:40.501
Wake up...

01:15:09.834 --> 01:15:11.251
You say that when a person lies,

01:15:12.209 --> 01:15:13.834
it's because he wants to, or he has to.

01:15:15.667 --> 01:15:18.959
Then what are you trying to hide?

01:15:28.917 --> 01:15:30.042
It's because...

01:15:31.542 --> 01:15:33.209
I killed the woman I love...

01:15:34.167 --> 01:15:36.167
...and my best friend.

01:15:46.709 --> 01:15:48.001
It's my fault,

01:15:48.667 --> 01:15:49.751
I killed them.

01:15:49.917 --> 01:15:50.834
It's my fault.

01:15:51.001 --> 01:15:53.501
Wait...

01:15:54.834 --> 01:15:56.917
Sorry...

01:16:05.084 --> 01:16:06.334
Are you remember now?

01:16:07.334 --> 01:16:08.376
Yes.

01:16:09.584 --> 01:16:11.251
I remember now.

01:16:14.584 --> 01:16:18.001
The man says he has already forgiven you.

01:16:20.542 --> 01:16:25.251
The woman says her love for you will never change.

01:16:40.667 --> 01:16:43.751
Do you believe me now?

01:16:45.251 --> 01:16:46.626
I believe,

01:16:48.084 --> 01:16:49.959
I believe you can see her.

01:16:51.417 --> 01:16:52.876
Can you tell her that...

01:16:54.209 --> 01:16:55.459
...I love her.

01:16:57.417 --> 01:16:59.001
I will always love her.

01:17:09.251 --> 01:17:10.751
She hears you.

01:17:33.376 --> 01:17:34.834
When you wake up,

01:17:36.251 --> 01:17:37.959
you will remember everything...

01:17:38.834 --> 01:17:40.251
...and you will let it all go.

01:17:42.001 --> 01:17:43.209
Three.

01:17:44.001 --> 01:17:45.126
Two.

01:17:46.042 --> 01:17:47.167
One.

01:18:01.917 --> 01:18:03.167
Gu Jie...

01:18:05.709 --> 01:18:06.709
Amy

01:18:08.917 --> 01:18:09.876
Ruining!

01:18:11.334 --> 01:18:12.167
Amy

01:18:12.876 --> 01:18:14.376
Dr. Gu, I'll take it from here.

01:18:33.251 --> 01:18:34.626
Hurry, check his pupils,

01:18:34.792 --> 01:18:36.167
see if everything's OK.

01:18:37.251 --> 01:18:38.584
I'll leave it to you,

01:18:38.917 --> 01:18:40.251
let me know if he wakes up.

01:18:40.417 --> 01:18:41.584
Got it.

01:18:46.959 --> 01:18:49.501
Dr. Gu, thank you!

01:18:49.709 --> 01:18:51.167
They are waiting for you upstairs.

01:19:14.251 --> 01:19:14.959
He should be fine.

01:19:15.126 --> 01:19:16.251
Thank you.

01:19:17.542 --> 01:19:20.292
Thank you, Miss Gu.

01:19:20.584 --> 01:19:22.459
I really don't know what to say.

01:19:22.709 --> 01:19:26.292
Because I know, this must be hard on you.

01:19:26.459 --> 01:19:28.792
Gu Jie, you did a great job.

01:19:29.251 --> 01:19:32.292
Professor Fang,
it's only because your method worked.

01:19:32.459 --> 01:19:34.542
Extreme situation requires extreme measures.

01:19:37.751 --> 01:19:41.167
Post-traumatic syndrome
is already difficult to cure...

01:19:41.709 --> 01:19:45.376
...and he's started to hurt himself.

01:19:47.626 --> 01:19:48.792
Dr. Xu...

01:19:49.959 --> 01:19:51.001
Dr. Xu...

01:19:51.709 --> 01:19:52.792
Dr. Xu!

01:19:55.959 --> 01:19:57.209
Dr. Xu...

01:20:08.251 --> 01:20:11.001
Sometimes we can't even be sure...

01:20:11.167 --> 01:20:13.751
...if he's awake or sleep-walking.

01:20:14.042 --> 01:20:15.126
Professor Fang,

01:20:15.709 --> 01:20:18.751
we really don't know what else to do.

01:20:24.876 --> 01:20:26.501
When you turn off the TV,

01:20:27.667 --> 01:20:29.501
you will forget everything...

01:20:31.709 --> 01:20:35.834
At first he thought he could use
his own expertise to convince everyone,

01:20:36.001 --> 01:20:38.501
including himself, that he has been cured.

01:20:38.667 --> 01:20:40.584
Professor Fang, some people think that...

01:20:40.751 --> 01:20:42.917
...I'm no longer fit to practice.

01:20:43.084 --> 01:20:45.084
They demand that I do this test for evaluation,

01:20:45.251 --> 01:20:46.751
but this is just nonsense.

01:20:46.917 --> 01:20:49.501
So I need you to sign off for me.

01:20:51.584 --> 01:20:52.709
I know,

01:20:53.209 --> 01:20:54.626
even if I don't sign off for you,

01:20:54.792 --> 01:20:57.251
you will deal with it your way.

01:20:58.126 --> 01:21:00.542
But can you deal with yourself
for the rest of your life?

01:21:00.709 --> 01:21:01.709
Are you OK?

01:21:03.501 --> 01:21:04.334
Uh... yeah.

01:21:04.501 --> 01:21:06.959
There is a restaurant nearby,

01:21:09.501 --> 01:21:11.751
we can just walk there.

01:21:11.917 --> 01:21:13.251
Let's go eat.

01:21:15.001 --> 01:21:16.626
I thought of a candidate,

01:21:17.376 --> 01:21:20.667
but the treatment might be a little controversial.

01:21:20.834 --> 01:21:22.376
Professor, I just have one question,

01:21:22.959 --> 01:21:24.334
why must it be me?

01:21:24.876 --> 01:21:28.167
Ruining's condition is caused
by long-term self-suppression,

01:21:28.584 --> 01:21:30.917
he urgently needs psychotherapy,

01:21:31.084 --> 01:21:33.501
but being a highly-skilled psychiatrist himself...

01:21:33.959 --> 01:21:35.751
...and trained professionally,

01:21:35.917 --> 01:21:38.917
normal treatment will do him no good,

01:21:39.334 --> 01:21:42.917
because he knows the procedure too well.

01:21:43.084 --> 01:21:44.584
Are you trying to hypnotize me?

01:21:45.667 --> 01:21:49.667
It must be someone he believes to be harmless,

01:21:49.834 --> 01:21:52.292
a patient, a stranger.

01:21:52.584 --> 01:21:53.917
How can this work?

01:21:54.084 --> 01:21:55.501
He and I know each other so well.

01:21:56.251 --> 01:21:59.417
Both of you are my students, so I know you both.

01:21:59.917 --> 01:22:03.334
Ruining is the best
in the field of normal hypnosis,

01:22:03.501 --> 01:22:06.459
but you specialize in Waking Hypnosis,

01:22:07.001 --> 01:22:10.709
you can induct a patient without him knowing.

01:22:10.876 --> 01:22:15.126
Besides, deep down, Ruining longs to be forgiven,

01:22:15.292 --> 01:22:18.667
and you are the key.

01:22:19.667 --> 01:22:20.834
We both know,

01:22:21.001 --> 01:22:24.459
our mental defenses are strongest when awake,

01:22:24.792 --> 01:22:28.292
and weakest when half-asleep half-awake.

01:22:29.001 --> 01:22:32.667
So we will pick the hour
when he believes himself to be strong,

01:22:32.834 --> 01:22:35.626
but is in fact, already exhausted...

01:22:35.792 --> 01:22:37.792
...as the start of the session.

01:22:40.292 --> 01:22:41.709
Hello, Miss Ren.

01:22:43.417 --> 01:22:45.084
Listen to the clock.

01:22:46.376 --> 01:22:47.542
It's slow.

01:22:47.709 --> 01:22:48.959
We will use hypnosis...

01:22:49.126 --> 01:22:50.501
...to make him forget who you are.

01:22:50.667 --> 01:22:52.084
Three...

01:22:52.251 --> 01:22:53.667
Two...

01:22:53.834 --> 01:22:55.334
One...

01:22:58.167 --> 01:23:00.251
Nice to meet you for the first time,

01:23:00.417 --> 01:23:02.126
my name is Ren Xiaoyan.

01:23:05.626 --> 01:23:06.417
Fortunately,

01:23:06.584 --> 01:23:09.667
Ruining doesn't know you used to have this name.

01:23:09.834 --> 01:23:12.667
The advantage of hypnotherapy...

01:23:13.167 --> 01:23:16.459
...is to let your patient...

01:23:16.626 --> 01:23:17.834
...forget that you're a doctor...

01:23:18.001 --> 01:23:21.126
...during the therapy.

01:23:21.834 --> 01:23:23.167
The most difficult thing is...

01:23:23.334 --> 01:23:26.459
...we have to make Ruining face his condition...

01:23:26.626 --> 01:23:28.834
...and yet not reveal what we're doing.

01:23:29.626 --> 01:23:33.376
So when he tries to hypnotize you,

01:23:33.542 --> 01:23:35.542
you must agree to go along.

01:23:36.751 --> 01:23:38.709
Of course, during this time,

01:23:38.876 --> 01:23:40.542
we need Amy to work with us,

01:23:40.709 --> 01:23:43.084
she will hide your real identity.

01:23:43.251 --> 01:23:44.584
Am)'

01:23:48.042 --> 01:23:49.292
Amy, where is her picture?

01:23:52.001 --> 01:23:53.709
Tell me what's behind the door.

01:23:54.167 --> 01:23:55.167
Three...

01:23:55.334 --> 01:23:56.251
Two...

01:23:56.417 --> 01:23:57.459
One...

01:23:57.834 --> 01:23:59.501
A very big lake.

01:24:04.834 --> 01:24:05.709
Also,

01:24:05.876 --> 01:24:08.709
Ruining can be quite ruthless in his hypnosis.

01:24:09.042 --> 01:24:11.001
He has even hypnotized a patient...

01:24:11.167 --> 01:24:13.709
...three times in the same session.

01:24:14.876 --> 01:24:18.167
So we have to prepare for that.

01:24:18.709 --> 01:24:21.209
Look at the back of my hand.

01:24:22.084 --> 01:24:23.209
Why...

01:24:23.376 --> 01:24:24.751
Why did you kill me?

01:24:24.917 --> 01:24:25.876
If he tries to make you reveal anything...

01:24:26.042 --> 01:24:29.417
...about your real identity,

01:24:29.584 --> 01:24:32.084
my trigger point will come in effect.

01:24:32.251 --> 01:24:33.834
- Who is it?
- It wasn't me...

01:24:34.001 --> 01:24:35.584
You will see me then.

01:24:38.042 --> 01:24:38.959
You are?

01:24:40.751 --> 01:24:42.917
Now I want you to think clearly...

01:24:43.084 --> 01:24:44.917
...why are you here?

01:24:46.917 --> 01:24:48.209
Three.

01:24:48.834 --> 01:24:50.084
Two.

01:24:51.042 --> 01:24:52.084
One.

01:24:57.959 --> 01:25:00.667
If he doesn't get a secret from me,

01:25:00.834 --> 01:25:02.459
he won't believe me.

01:25:03.167 --> 01:25:04.417
I know him very well,

01:25:04.584 --> 01:25:06.792
I have to make him feel like he's winning.

01:25:06.959 --> 01:25:08.542
How do you plan to do that?

01:25:09.251 --> 01:25:13.001
There is a secret I never told anyone.

01:25:17.792 --> 01:25:19.626
I have prepared my fake medical record,

01:25:19.792 --> 01:25:20.959
just tell him this story.

01:25:21.126 --> 01:25:22.751
Let me remind you,

01:25:22.917 --> 01:25:25.334
there's something wrong with this woman.

01:25:25.501 --> 01:25:26.626
I know what I'm doing.

01:25:26.792 --> 01:25:27.959
His mind is so sharp,

01:25:28.126 --> 01:25:31.042
are you sure he will believe this medical record?

01:25:31.459 --> 01:25:33.042
I want him to not believe it.

01:25:33.209 --> 01:25:34.334
But actually, you're an orphan.

01:25:34.501 --> 01:25:35.292
My birthday is March 3.

01:25:35.459 --> 01:25:36.459
Then what about your fiance?

01:25:36.626 --> 01:25:38.751
Why can't you believe that I can see ghosts?

01:25:38.917 --> 01:25:40.792
The issue is why I saw them.

01:25:41.209 --> 01:25:43.334
In order to break his mental defenses,

01:25:43.501 --> 01:25:46.292
we have to completely shatter his ego...

01:25:46.542 --> 01:25:49.667
...and completely overturn...

01:25:49.876 --> 01:25:51.417
...everything he normally believes.

01:25:52.667 --> 01:25:54.542
Once his ego is shattered,

01:25:54.917 --> 01:25:56.626
the cracks will start to show through,

01:25:57.001 --> 01:26:00.042
and he will start believing whatever Gu Jie says.

01:26:00.209 --> 01:26:03.001
There are two people behind you...

01:26:03.209 --> 01:26:04.001
Three.

01:26:04.167 --> 01:26:05.001
Two.

01:26:05.167 --> 01:26:06.334
One.

01:26:32.959 --> 01:26:34.209
It's my fault,

01:26:35.001 --> 01:26:36.501
I killed them...

01:26:37.209 --> 01:26:39.876
Do you believe me now?

01:26:41.084 --> 01:26:42.292
I believe.

01:26:44.626 --> 01:26:46.376
I believe you can see her.

01:26:48.334 --> 01:26:49.834
Can you tell her that...

01:26:51.042 --> 01:26:52.209
I love her.

01:26:57.376 --> 01:26:58.751
Dr. Xu is awake.

01:27:00.001 --> 01:27:01.167
Dr. Xu is awake.

01:27:02.334 --> 01:27:03.459
Come with me to see him.

01:27:03.626 --> 01:27:06.251
Great, let's to see him.

01:27:06.417 --> 01:27:08.459
Professor Fang, I want to see Ruining too.

01:28:07.751 --> 01:28:08.959
Cheers!

01:28:11.501 --> 01:28:13.376
Sorry to bother you all,

01:28:13.542 --> 01:28:16.001
it's our friend's birthday today.

01:28:16.167 --> 01:28:19.126
She wants to come on stage and sing for us.

01:28:19.292 --> 01:28:21.667
Shall we welcome her?

01:28:23.001 --> 01:28:23.501
No.

01:28:23.667 --> 01:28:25.709
Are you coming? If not, I'll start singing.

01:28:25.876 --> 01:28:27.001
Don't!

01:28:27.167 --> 01:28:28.209
Come on!

01:29:17.459 --> 01:29:18.542
Gu Jie,

01:29:19.876 --> 01:29:21.501
it's been hard for you.

01:29:23.334 --> 01:29:24.792
He has finally let go,

01:29:24.959 --> 01:29:26.334
what about you?

01:29:45.459 --> 01:29:46.667
Professor Fang.

01:29:49.584 --> 01:29:51.292
I will take good care of him.

01:29:51.459 --> 01:29:52.459
Don't drink too much!

01:29:52.626 --> 01:29:54.167
You drank too much, don't drive.

01:29:54.334 --> 01:29:55.334
You go do your thing.

01:29:55.501 --> 01:29:56.834
Just go.

01:30:01.417 --> 01:30:02.751
I'm so happy today.

01:30:28.126 --> 01:30:29.459
You're holding me too tight.

01:30:39.667 --> 01:30:41.001
You...

01:30:41.959 --> 01:30:43.626
...how long will you love me?

01:32:36.251 --> 01:32:37.542
You know?

01:32:40.001 --> 01:32:41.709
Whenever people tell me...

01:32:42.917 --> 01:32:44.334
...not to take it too hard,

01:32:44.501 --> 01:32:45.917
it's not your fault,

01:32:47.542 --> 01:32:49.834
I feel like they are reminding me...

01:32:51.251 --> 01:32:52.876
...that it is my fault.

01:32:56.459 --> 01:32:58.834
What I fear hearing the most is...

01:32:59.667 --> 01:33:01.167
...you did all you could.

01:33:03.292 --> 01:33:04.917
Because only I know that...

01:33:05.959 --> 01:33:07.251
...I didn't give it my all.

01:33:10.334 --> 01:33:12.209
I should've tried a little harder.

01:33:16.126 --> 01:33:17.251
So...

01:33:18.501 --> 01:33:20.292
...it's not that I couldn't be cured,

01:33:21.626 --> 01:33:23.376
I just didn't want to be cured.

01:33:25.501 --> 01:33:27.834
Because I didn't feel that I deserved forgiveness.

01:33:29.376 --> 01:33:30.584
Nobody“.

01:33:33.001 --> 01:33:34.792
Nobody can forgive me.

01:33:40.084 --> 01:33:41.292
You are right.

01:33:43.334 --> 01:33:45.209
Nobody can forgive you,

01:33:51.042 --> 01:33:52.417
except yourself.
