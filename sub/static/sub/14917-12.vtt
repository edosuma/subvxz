00:05.310 --> 00:09.470
Well,that's what I like so much about your book,is how you tied your own family into it.

00:09.700 --> 00:11.730
Tell me,kitty,were they supportive?

00:11.780 --> 00:14.080
-Are they supportive?  
-Are they still talking to you?

00:14.110 --> 00:17.770
you know,they-- they actually are supportive.And I-I'm lucky that way...

00:17.890 --> 00:21.420
two to three more weeks to finish?Come on,guys,we demo at the conference in nine days.

00:21.510 --> 00:24.010
We know.That's why we're...reassessing.

00:24.100 --> 00:25.680
-Well,I don't understand.What happened?  
-Nothing.

00:25.720 --> 00:27.940
There are always...last-minute bugs.

00:28.040 --> 00:30.860
It's all right.It's fine.We just need to farm out some of the code writing.

00:30.950 --> 00:33.600
Okay.Good,good.I like that.

00:33.600 --> 00:35.510
-How mu will that be?  
-45000

00:35.600 --> 00:37.570
-What?
-45000

00:37.660 --> 00:38.590
But we'll make our deadline.

00:38.690 --> 00:40.080
Listen,sarah,we can't not fix this,all ri t?

00:40.210 --> 00:42.210
Every big tech investor is gonna be at this conference.

00:42.230 --> 00:43.660
If the web site crashes,we're done.

00:43.740 --> 00:47.250
-That's why we also need to lease the extra server space.-Right.

00:47.350 --> 00:49.030
How much will that be?

00:49.140 --> 00:50.480
-30 grand.
-Oh,god.Okay.

00:50.580 --> 00:52.610
Plus the conference fees.

00:52.720 --> 00:56.620
So what you're telling me is,if we don't find $120,000 by,

00:56.730 --> 01:00.890
yesterday,we're not gonna be able to launch?

01:00.950 --> 01:02.630
yes.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.220
mom,I really can't talk right now.

01:08.310 --> 01:09.440
Okay,really,really quickly.

01:09.560 --> 01:12.340
Roger sn't delivered the plans for the center yet.

01:12.480 --> 01:17.480
I--look,I need to know how to handle an employee who isn't living up to expectations.

01:17.580 --> 01:20.430
I am not the person that you want to be talking to right now.

01:20.540 --> 01:23.380
He was supposed to have them finished over two weeks ago.

01:23.480 --> 01:24.550
Look,I don't know,mom.

01:24.650 --> 01:25.730
Keep harassing him.

01:25.830 --> 01:28.210
Listen,I have my own deadline crisis to deal with right now.

01:28.320 --> 01:31.130
I just woke up to find that greenatopia has one foot in the grave.

01:31.230 --> 01:31.940
In the grave?

01:31.980 --> 01:33.870
Yes,mother,the grave.

01:35.750 --> 01:38.500
if I don't come up with $120,000 today,

01:38.600 --> 01:41.740
we won't make our conference,which means we'll fail before we launch.

01:41.840 --> 01:43.440
I might as well jump off a bridge,

01:43.540 --> 01:47.490
because the last three months of my life will have proven to be completely futile.

01:47.580 --> 01:48.910
-Sarah. 
-I'm just joking mother.

01:49.040 --> 01:52.860
I'll figure something out.I always do because I have to,and I will.

01:52.930 --> 01:54.970
-Good-bye. 
-Okay,bye.

01:55.070 --> 01:59.400
-how on earth did you pull it off?  
-I-I don't know.I mostly just jotted down thoughts and

01:59.490 --> 02:04.030
-- but,you know,the book really didn't take shape until the campaign was over and I had some time to reflect.

02:04.060 --> 02:06.100
-but tell me,kitty...  
-I need to be able to know that I can talk to you...

02:06.720 --> 02:09.150
-As a trusted member of my political team...  
-you get your husband back for one thing.

02:09.210 --> 02:13.340
not that becoming the first lady would've been so bad,either?

02:13.370 --> 02:16.060
no,I am-- I'm grateful that I get to be home...

02:16.100 --> 02:17.430
I need you to do me a favor.

02:17.460 --> 02:20.330
I want a meeting,and it has to be a sit-down...

02:20.450 --> 02:22.590
with gordon alexander.

02:22.690 --> 02:24.070
Is this our ask or theirs?

02:24.200 --> 02:25.440
I'm asking for the meeting.

02:25.450 --> 02:27.000
-He's only here a few days...  
-that's what I like so much about your book,

02:27.060 --> 02:31.000
-is how you tied your own family into it.  
-tell me,kitty,were they supportive?

02:31.000 --> 02:33.890
-Are they supportive?  
-Are they still talking to you?

02:33.890 --> 02:37.290
you know,they-- they actually are supportive.I'm-- I'm very lucky that way.

02:37.370 --> 02:40.800
Okay,jumping on it.Calling the mysterious man with two first names.

02:40.850 --> 02:42.950
-Thank you. 
-Let's say hi to them,okay?

02:42.980 --> 02:43.970
Hi,kitty's family!

02:44.100 --> 02:45.230
Hi,walkers!

02:45.770 --> 02:46.770
It was great.

02:47.570 --> 02:48.850
You were great.

02:50.060 --> 02:51.540
Well,thanks.

02:53.430 --> 02:55.780
just say it,mother.You thought I gave a lousy interview.

02:55.910 --> 02:57.550
Honey,I told you,I tught you were wonderful.

02:57.650 --> 03:01.740
It's just I thought you were the messenger,delivering roger's plans for my treatment center.

03:01.870 --> 03:03.790
I don't know what is taking him so long.

03:03.920 --> 03:04.860
Okay.Okay,fine.

03:04.960 --> 03:08.960
That explains your less-than-enthusiastic response,but it doesn't explain robert'S.

03:09.070 --> 03:13.770
He--he barely noticed that I was on the screen.

03:13.800 --> 03:15.300
Oh,milk.Yuck.

03:15.420 --> 03:16.580
Could I get you your own cup?

03:16.910 --> 03:18.620
That would be great.Black,please.

03:18.690 --> 03:21.820
Honey,you know,you have been giving a lot of interviews.

03:21.860 --> 03:24.230
Well,I'm t saying that the world has to stop,

03:24.250 --> 03:28.100
but he was on the phone the entire time,talking business with kevin.

03:28.220 --> 03:30.060
Maybe it's hard for him.

03:30.160 --> 03:31.340
You're in the spotlight now.

03:31.440 --> 03:32.700
He's not used to it.

03:32.810 --> 03:33.940
He's "the senator.

03:34.070 --> 03:39.290
" Exactly,and he won this position by making constituents believe that he really is interested in their lives.

03:39.290 --> 03:41.020
I'm sorry,but pay me the same courtesy.

03:41.020 --> 03:43.510
well,if it--if it makes you feel any better,

03:43.630 --> 03:49.070
we're all very excited about coming to your book reading tomorrow.

03:49.200 --> 03:51.250
Really?E-everybody's going?

03:51.280 --> 03:51.850
Oh,yeah.

03:51.970 --> 03:56.940
He ma,do you have any,uh,utensils,like forks,knives or a,you know,a whisk?

03:57.010 --> 03:58.850
-in the top drawer right there.  
-all right.

03:58.860 --> 04:00.980
Did he just ask for a whisk?

04:00.980 --> 04:01.650
I did.

04:01.710 --> 04:06.190
mom,how many spatulas do you have?

04:06.310 --> 04:07.570
so when's the big moving day?

04:07.700 --> 04:09.060
big moving day is tomorrow.

04:10.640 --> 04:12.480
that means I can't make your thing tomorrow.

04:12.620 --> 04:17.149
Justin,you're not moving into a palace,for god sake.It's not gonna take you all day.

04:17.240 --> 04:20.459
You're right.It's actually gonna take longer,just to make that place livable.

04:20.810 --> 04:22.440
So I'm outta here.I love you.

04:22.440 --> 04:24.200
-I'm sorry.You love m- -Whatever.

04:24.230 --> 04:27.020
- mom. -You know what?

04:27.020 --> 04:30.330
You can't have this one.

04:30.490 --> 04:33.950
I like...fine.

04:34.420 --> 04:37.520
so much for family support.

04:37.650 --> 04:39.520
You know,honey,I wanted to talk to you about that.

04:39.690 --> 04:43.250
I really think that sarah could use some.Support,

04:43.270 --> 04:44.830
-that is. -Why?

04:44.850 --> 04:46.540
I-I-is everything okay?

04:46.540 --> 04:50.840
Well...you know that technology conference that's coming up?

04:50.980 --> 04:53.340
They don't have the money to be ready in time.

04:53.450 --> 04:56.230
Wait a minute.Thought that every potential investor goes to that thing.

04:56.300 --> 04:56.980
I know.GoD.

04:57.140 --> 04:59.310
If you could've seen how upset sarah is...

04:59.520 --> 05:01.980
of course,it was sarah,and she was trying to hide it.

05:02.110 --> 05:05.140
I would offer my help,but every dime I have is going into the center.

05:05.240 --> 05:07.210
Tommy's still digging out ojai.

05:07.350 --> 05:11.230
Kevin is making youold government salary,and justin can't afford a whisk.

05:11.870 --> 05:13.320
How much does she need?

05:13.430 --> 05:15.550
It--it would just be a short-term loan.

05:15.570 --> 05:17.160
How much?

05:19.130 --> 05:20.610
No,are you-- I know.It's a lot of money,

05:20.730 --> 05:23.600
but you would get the money back,just as soon as the conference is over.

05:23.600 --> 05:28.460
And sarah is sure that they're gonna walk away with a huginflux of cash.

05:28.550 --> 05:30.380
Well,what if she doesn't?

05:30.490 --> 05:32.080
Well,that's not very supportive.

05:32.110 --> 05:33.460
mother,don't you do that.

05:33.570 --> 05:36.920
Don't turn it--I,of-- of course I want to be supporve,but if-- great.

05:37.050 --> 05:40.530
Okay,so,kitty,don't just hand her a check,all right?

05:40.630 --> 05:42.830
You have to make it feel like it was her idea.

05:42.950 --> 05:46.490
you know how sensitive she is about needing help.

05:47.630 --> 05:51.500
Justin,I--you know what?I said you could have a few items...Not the entire kitchen.

05:51.550 --> 05:54.280
ReX.It's from roger.A messenger just dropped it off.

05:54.300 --> 05:55.700
No.No,no,no.The plans--

05:55.700 --> 05:57.430
-they come all rolled up in a tube thing. -No,no.No,no.

05:57.520 --> 06:00.030
I don't think this could be plans.It's gotta be a model or something.

06:00.040 --> 06:01.920
-let's open it up.Come on,--No.-No,no,no,no.

06:01.960 --> 06:05.260
-Let's not open it.Let's just wait.No,no,no,no.  --Let's just open it,mom.Let's open it.

06:05.260 --> 06:06.960
Oh.God.

06:07.030 --> 06:09.850
Don't hurt it.

06:16.240 --> 06:20.080
The portico will go,but I'm leaving a few of the neocolonial flourishes.

06:20.080 --> 06:28.000
That way,there will be a conversation between american pretension and asian aesthetic,culminating in...

06:28.140 --> 06:29.940
oh,hello.

06:30.270 --> 06:32.540
I-I don't-- I don't want to interrupt.

06:32.680 --> 06:34.270
No,not at all.Your timing is perfect.

06:34.320 --> 06:35.900
Christopher,go and help mrs.Walker with the model.

06:35.920 --> 06:36.960
no,no,it's fine,it's fine.

06:37.180 --> 06:38.530
It's--oh,okay.That's good,too.

06:38.590 --> 06:41.490
I was just explaining our concept.But now that you're here,

06:41.600 --> 06:46.850
why don't you tell us your reactions to the design?

06:47.910 --> 06:51.490
I don't-- I don't think-- roger,can I just speak with you privately for a moment?

06:51.620 --> 06:52.590
Nora,don't be shy.

06:52.720 --> 06:53.450
You're the client.

06:53.580 --> 06:54.980
Tell us what you think.

06:55.090 --> 06:56.290
- maybe later.  -Please.

06:56.300 --> 07:04.710
You'll be doing my young associates a favor,giving them a tutorial in architect-client relations.

07:04.820 --> 07:06.900
Well,um...

07:07.030 --> 07:11.590
the concept is very exciting,certainly.

07:12.110 --> 07:13.110
But I have to say that...

07:13.240 --> 07:17.230
I was hoping for something a little more traditional.

07:17.350 --> 07:19.200
Go on.

07:19.310 --> 07:23.180
well,this concept is not exactly what we discussed.

07:23.270 --> 07:24.500
Well done.

07:24.510 --> 07:29.920
You've just given us a-a textbook example of how an inexperienced layperson reacts to a new

07:29.950 --> 07:34.030
and unconventional project.Please continue.

07:34.390 --> 07:44.200
Well,yes,I suppose I am inexperienced,roger,but I thought we agreed on something warm and nurturing and cheerful.

07:44.340 --> 07:47.870
This is what happens when a client has a limited architectural vocabulary.

07:47.990 --> 07:51.710
They speak in clichés,so naturally they expect a clichéd design.

07:51.840 --> 07:55.010
Half our job as architects is to educate our clients.

07:55.010 --> 07:58.550
I did not expect a clich?

07:58.900 --> 08:02.310
nor did I expect a cold glass tube pasted to the back of the house.

08:02.370 --> 08:06.280
This is not a tube.This is a tower--a warm,cheerful,nurturing tower.

08:06.310 --> 08:09.520
I suppose it is nurturing if you're a hothouse tomato!

08:09.630 --> 08:12.650
But I think our residents would appreciate a little something called privacy.

08:12.780 --> 08:16.830
How.....- no doubt you want to stitch up some dreadful gingham curtains and make the whole thing traditional.

08:16.940 --> 08:20.970
Roger,I'm just really frightened that this design wouldn't pass the safety inspection.

08:21.110 --> 08:31.890
All the glass and everything-- I mean,a great big tree could topple over and just smash the whole thing to smithereens!

08:32.030 --> 08:36.419
And I believe that is the end of the tutorial for the day.

08:36.419 --> 08:40.900
<font color=#38B0DE>brothers.and.sisters.
Season 3 Episode 12</font>

08:44.300 --> 08:45.660
Kevin.

08:46.940 --> 08:49.220
What's going on with the alexander meeting? I don't see it on my agenda.

08:49.330 --> 08:50.730
good morning to you.And F.Y.I.

08:50.840 --> 08:53.890
--My law degree makes me slightly overqualified to book meetings.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.140
I just do not want this going through the office gossip mill.

08:57.150 --> 08:58.740
-What's so top secret?  
-What the hell's the holdup?

08:58.820 --> 09:01.560
Relax,it's in the works.Right now,the only time he's available,you're not.

09:01.690 --> 09:04.460
-Well,cancel whatever it is I have  
-kitty's book signing?

09:04.540 --> 09:06.520
-I've read the book.  
-I don't think she wants a book report.

09:06.640 --> 09:08.680
She's probably more interested in your support.

09:08.770 --> 09:11.570
Well,she's got it.I-I just watched her on "regis and kelly.

09:11.690 --> 09:12.610
" Believe me,she--she'll be fine.

09:12.720 --> 09:13.310
Are you sure?

09:13.420 --> 09:15.540
Because she was with you for every rally,every speech.

09:15.670 --> 09:17.650
Every time you wanted her by your side,she was there.

09:17.760 --> 09:19.680
Let me worry about my wife.

09:19.780 --> 09:21.500
I'm only ting to protect your best interests.

09:21.600 --> 09:24.340
Book the meeting.

09:26.550 --> 09:28.320
did you see it in today's paper?

09:28.410 --> 09:30.430
Wee--we're trying to get as many people as we can.

09:30.530 --> 09:33.600
My--my publicist wants a line snaking out the door.

09:33.720 --> 09:35.150
Since when do you have a publicist?

09:35.280 --> 09:37.260
Well,she works for my-- my publisher.

09:37.380 --> 09:39.720
I thought this was just a simple book signing.

09:39.840 --> 09:44.940
Well,yeah,it is,but they're having a very fancy reception afterwards with--with press.

09:45.060 --> 09:46.670
What--what--what do you think I should wear?

09:46.770 --> 09:52.030
Do you think I should sell the sizzle or the--the steak?

09:52.160 --> 09:52.930
Kitty.

09:53.050 --> 09:57.080
Honey,it's--it's deaning to refer to yourself as beef.

09:57.220 --> 09:58.960
but if you want to sell books--sizzle.

09:58.990 --> 10:03.900
I mean,look at ann coulter.She sells millions of books.And believe me,there ain't no protein in that package.

10:03.960 --> 10:07.240
So tell me,will you-- what--what did sarah say when you spoke wither?

10:07.340 --> 10:09.340
I've just--I just haven't had a-a chance yet.

10:09.430 --> 10:11.850
Kitty,she's under tremendous time pressure.

10:11.910 --> 10:14.220
You know,I was actually just about to call her when--

10:14.350 --> 10:17.960
when I got interrupted by-- by--by your phone call.

10:18.080 --> 10:20.360
well,all right,it's probably better in person,anyway.

10:20.470 --> 10:21.570
saul's here.

10:21.780 --> 10:22.920
I have to go.

10:23.080 --> 10:27.110
but just remember now,it has to feel like it was her idea.

10:27.220 --> 10:28.080
Okay,I know.

10:28.170 --> 10:29.870
You've-- you've told me.

10:29.980 --> 10:31.580
Okay.Bye.

10:37.100 --> 10:38.010
is that all you've got?

10:38.140 --> 10:41.130
Well,I'm sorry that my architectural library is insufficient.

10:41.250 --> 10:42.790
I'm sure roger has plenty of books.

10:42.820 --> 10:45.540
Roger is my problem.Condescending jerk.

10:45.660 --> 10:48.390
But no more.I'm gonna learn his lingo.

10:48.490 --> 10:53.600
So when I tell him to stick his plans his flying buttress,I'll know exactly what I'm talking about.

10:53.710 --> 10:55.810
Please,just don't be antagonistic.

10:55.910 --> 10:57.640
Why are you taking his side?

10:57.740 --> 11:02.130
Just look at the drawings that he sent over for the exterior.

11:02.220 --> 11:03.930
Look at that,it's absurd.

11:04.040 --> 11:08.250
Well,it may not be your cup of tea,but objectively speaking,this is very innovative.

11:08.360 --> 11:10.270
Objectivity is not paying the bills.

11:10.380 --> 11:11.180
I am.

11:11.320 --> 11:12.640
And it's too modern.

11:12.760 --> 11:14.030
It's--it's cold.

11:14.150 --> 11:18.860
Okay,I admit that it might be a little unusual for a residential project,but I see what he's going for.

11:18.970 --> 11:23.670
I mean,the asian vernacular-- it lets in all that light.

11:23.690 --> 11:26.210
It's meditative and calming.

11:26.340 --> 11:29.080
This is for the families of seriously ill children.

11:29.200 --> 11:33.020
It's supposed to feel like a home away from home,not a museum,not a yoga retreat.

11:33.130 --> 11:36.470
You just asked me what I thought-- okay,all right,sorry.

11:36.600 --> 11:38.850
I'm sorry.

11:38.980 --> 11:40.850
Do you want a ride tonight to kitty's book signing?

11:40.970 --> 11:43.090
no,I don't think tonight's gonna be good.Anyway,

11:43.210 --> 11:50.790
there'gonna be a rush of people there,so she won't even know that I'm not there.

11:51.030 --> 11:51.710
What?

11:51.840 --> 11:53.080
You've got a date tonight.

11:53.240 --> 11:54.740
oh,my god.

11:54.860 --> 11:56.590
Why are you so obsessed with my social life?

11:56.720 --> 11:57.930
I'm not obsessed.

11:58.040 --> 11:59.940
My favorite brother-- only brother.

12:00.050 --> 12:01.420
Well,in this family,you never know.

12:01.450 --> 12:07.330
Okay,my only brother,when he finds someone that he cares about,I wanna know him.

12:07.440 --> 12:11.980
Well,you will,when the time is right.

12:12.120 --> 12:13.610
But just not tonight.

12:13.740 --> 12:14.440
Be a good girl.

12:14.580 --> 12:16.430
Oh,shut up.

12:18.000 --> 12:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:26.770 --> 12:28.900
Tommy,it's--it's good to see you.How's elizabeth?

12:29.040 --> 12:30.380
Much better.Tha you.

12:30.420 --> 12:33.100
You and julia must be so relieved.

12:33.210 --> 12:33.880
we are.

12:34.220 --> 12:35.680
can you give us a minute?

12:35.790 --> 12:37.870
sure.actually,I'll take these to graphics.

12:37.910 --> 12:39.310
Okay,get me a copy of that one.

12:39.650 --> 12:40.910
Thanks.

12:46.110 --> 12:49.450
why are we in talks with blackridge wholesale?

12:49.570 --> 12:52.670
Last time I checked,this company handles its own distribution.

12:52.800 --> 12:54.610
Maybe up until now.

12:54.630 --> 12:56.960
But with the economy being the way it is

12:56.990 --> 12:59.690
right,which is exactly why we shouldn't pursue this.

12:59.810 --> 13:02.650
I mean,half of this company's profits come from our distribution,

13:02.780 --> 13:05.140
and you want to,what,just hand that money over to blackridge?

13:05.270 --> 13:06.970
No,no,I don't want to,tommy.

13:07.070 --> 13:08.220
We have to.

13:08.250 --> 13:12.850
We have to start moving units around to lower our price point.

13:12.860 --> 13:15.300
I mean,people are gonna stop buying.

13:15.400 --> 13:16.400
It's a good move.

13:16.530 --> 13:18.670
So why wasn't I consulted?

13:18.810 --> 13:23.330
Well,I-I didn't want to pull you away from elizabeth's bedside to bring you into the office to

13:23.330 --> 13:25.460
talk about distri-- it is a phone call,holly.

13:26.710 --> 13:28.210
I tried.

13:28.380 --> 13:31.860
More than once.

13:31.970 --> 13:34.710
The board wanted an immediate proposal.

13:34.820 --> 13:35.850
This went to the board?

13:35.970 --> 13:36.930
YeS.

13:37.070 --> 13:39.510
and they signed off on it unanimously.

13:39.630 --> 13:40.880
The deal's already gone to legal.

13:41.000 --> 13:44.290
Now if you want to take it up with them,then go ahead.I--

13:44.610 --> 13:48.520
Thanks.Thanks for your permission.

13:48.760 --> 13:56.890
Tommy,if you have a better idea than this one to stave off this huge financial hit in this climate,

13:57.010 --> 14:04.270
I would love to know what it is. 
-Why?My opinion doesn't matter around here.

14:07.320 --> 14:08.640
Whaare you guys typing?

14:08.800 --> 14:12.220
it's an algorithm for a given class of problems,of which we have many.

14:12.310 --> 14:14.260
Don't bother them,kitty.They have a lot to do.

14:14.360 --> 14:18.030
No,no.I-I can see that you guys are really--really under the gun.

14:18.150 --> 14:23.140
Have you--have you,I don't know,thought about hiring some extra hands or--or--or minds?

14:23.270 --> 14:26.230
thonly people we could afford to hire right now are people prepared to work for free.

14:26.350 --> 14:35.860
Right,well,you know,I mean--I mean,I-I don't know,but have you considered maybe asking for help?

14:36.490 --> 14:37.700
Yes,actually.

14:37.830 --> 14:39.830
I've applied for an emergency small business loan.

14:40.020 --> 14:42.440
well,I applied to harvard.It's not like I got in.

14:42.530 --> 14:44.790
But I don't want to talk about it.

14:45.090 --> 14:48.750
you know,sarah,I-I totally understand,but,

14:48.880 --> 14:52.610
you know,you know,things have actually been going pretty well for me recently.

14:52.720 --> 14:55.820
good,good,is that supposed to make me feel better?

14:55.920 --> 14:57.800
you know what?This is like pulling teeth.Fine.Here.

14:57.910 --> 14:58.720
I wrote you a check.

14:58.840 --> 15:00.150
I'm sorry it wasn't your idea.

15:00.270 --> 15:01.180
-Check?  -Yes.

15:01.190 --> 15:03.990
Oh,my god,that's amazing.

15:04.250 --> 15:07.090
$120,000?

15:07.190 --> 15:09.200
mom told you.

15:09.310 --> 15:09.960
Well,thank you.

15:10.070 --> 15:11.140
No,I can't accept it.

15:11.240 --> 15:12.370
Family and money don't mix.

15:12.500 --> 15:14.360
Sarah,we--we have a family business.

15:14.480 --> 15:17.150
look how that turned out.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.260
No,no,no,no,no.

15:18.380 --> 15:20.660
No,no,sarah,I'm sorry,but you--you have to be realistic right now.

15:20.790 --> 15:22.720
I mean,this is not a good time to get a loan.

15:22.780 --> 15:24.660
You may be right,but I don't want a handout.

15:24.780 --> 15:27.460
give it to me.I love handouts.

15:27.570 --> 15:30.300
I can't believe mom felt the need to broadcast my problems.

15:30.380 --> 15:33.200
Look,sarah,if you need the money-- we do.We need the money.

15:33.380 --> 15:35.610
-We don'T. -Here,fine,take it.

15:35.640 --> 15:36.220
So what?

15:36.340 --> 15:38.540
So what if you're--you're in a little over your heads?

15:38.650 --> 15:39.840
God,you always do this.

15:40.010 --> 15:40.860
You swoop in.

15:40.990 --> 15:42.110
-I do not swoop.  -Yes,you do.

15:42.180 --> 15:45.450
You swoop in on your high horse and--what horse?

15:45.530 --> 15:47.020
I'm sorry.I think I'm here to help you.

15:47.150 --> 15:48.550
I didn't ask for your help,kitty.

15:49.160 --> 15:50.610
Give her the check.

15:50.730 --> 15:52.660
Ethan,give her that check.

15:52.700 --> 15:53.230
No...

15:53.350 --> 15:56.290
I don't need my condescending sister-- condescending?

15:56.420 --> 15:57.150
She didn't mean that.

15:57.300 --> 15:58.350
Do you know what?You know what,sarah?

15:58.440 --> 16:02.100
I find this really hard to believe,because this is about preserving your company.

16:02.220 --> 16:04.400
What happened to all your republican values of self-reliance?

16:04.490 --> 16:06.810
god.You're not gonna bring in my--my politics now?

16:06.950 --> 16:07.960
I voted republican once.

16:08.100 --> 16:10.020
You know,so what if I'm doing a little bit better than you right now?

16:10.150 --> 16:14.450
You honestlyhink you're doing better than me because you're hawking your book all over creation?

16:14.490 --> 16:16.290
Hawking?Hawking my book?Hawking my book?Oh,I'm sorry.

16:16.290 --> 16:17.780
I'm so sorry that I tried to help you.

16:17.780 --> 16:19.180
You know what,sarah?I'm really sorry.

16:19.320 --> 16:21.190
I'm sorry that I came to help.

16:21.220 --> 16:22.080
Gosh,I'm sorry.

16:22.210 --> 16:25.430
I am never gonna come and help again,that's for sure.

16:26.140 --> 16:31.380
Not only did she treat my check like it had anthrax ont,e--she said some really hurtful things.

16:31.460 --> 16:32.080
like what?

16:32.130 --> 16:35.220
Okay,like,like I was being condescending.

16:35.230 --> 16:36.320
that's nothing.

16:36.460 --> 16:37.730
I say that all the time.

16:37.900 --> 16:40.190
And I always "swoop in."

16:40.470 --> 16:42.760
she called you a swooper?That really is unforgivable.

16:42.890 --> 16:45.160
It wasn't even my idea,okay?

16:45.250 --> 16:46.830
It was mom'S.Mom.

16:46.940 --> 16:48.840
Mom was the one who wanted to swoop in.

16:48.970 --> 16:51.750
I-I don't even know why i got myself all sucked up in it.

16:51.860 --> 16:54.950
Because you're a nice person,and you forget what sarah's like when her pride's on the line.

16:55.060 --> 16:57.780
well,guess what.She's not the only one in this family who has pride,

16:57.780 --> 17:02.010
and if she gives me any attitude at the book signing tonight,I-- about that...

17:02.680 --> 17:06.349
Don't-- no,don't tell me.Robert-- robert isn't coming.

17:06.740 --> 17:08.140
Him,me...

17:08.160 --> 17:09.780
-you?
-Well,look,I'm really sorry.

17:09.900 --> 17:14.430
He's making me go to some meeting with a fat-cat real estate mogul from sacramento.

17:14.550 --> 17:17.069
What fat cat?

17:17.170 --> 17:18.420
Kevin.

17:18.560 --> 17:21.460
What fat cat?

17:21.579 --> 17:25.800
gordon alexander.

17:29.650 --> 17:32.680
oh,my god.Oh,my god.

17:32.800 --> 17:34.060
What?

17:34.170 --> 17:35.680
He's angling for governor.

17:35.780 --> 17:36.640
Who?

17:36.770 --> 17:37.720
Robert.

17:37.810 --> 17:38.760
Don't be ridiculous.

17:38.830 --> 17:42.920
I'm not.If someone wants to run for state office in california,you have to go through gordon alexander.

17:43.050 --> 17:45.930
Come on,if robert had any intention of running for governor,I think I'd know.

17:46.060 --> 17:48.350
Well,did you ask him?

17:48.480 --> 17:49.140
No.

17:49.250 --> 17:50.420
Okay,kevin,you have to find out.

17:50.460 --> 17:53.640
-Who,me?  
-you.He's not gonna tell me until he's absolutely sure.

17:53.760 --> 17:54.850
Well,I--you know what?

17:54.970 --> 17:56.020
I really don't think you have anything worry about.

17:56.130 --> 17:59.040
I hope not,because if he is-- he's not.

17:59.080 --> 18:02.340
just find out,kevin.

18:02.460 --> 18:04.710
I gotta go.

18:11.050 --> 18:11.660
mom

18:12.180 --> 18:13.380
There you are.

18:13.510 --> 18:14.830
Sarah,I'm so glad you're here.

18:14.960 --> 18:16.250
You're a very smart woman.

18:16.540 --> 18:23.780
Can you explain to me the difference between "neoclassicism" and "neo-palladian"?

18:23.900 --> 18:28.420
Mom,why did you tell kitty that I was in over my head?

18:28.550 --> 18:29.460
I never said that.

18:29.570 --> 18:32.620
Oh,so when she descended from on high,whips out her checkbook...

18:32.750 --> 18:34.910
she whipped out her-- oh,god.

18:35.020 --> 18:36.170
I told her to be tactful.

18:36.260 --> 18:38.820
Oh,come on,mom.Kitty don't do tact.

18:38.950 --> 18:41.230
Why did you have to paint such a dire picture?

18:41.350 --> 18:42.730
Well,I wasn't trying to be dire.

18:42.850 --> 18:45.520
You said you had one foot in the grave--your words.

18:45.630 --> 18:48.510
Yes,but the other foot was in the bank.

18:48.640 --> 18:50.020
I was taking care of it.

18:50.160 --> 18:54.180
Sweetheart,why is it so hard for you to ask for help?

18:54.320 --> 18:54.980
Excuse me?

18:55.110 --> 18:56.340
This is what happened at ojai.

18:56.450 --> 18:57.780
The company almost went under.

18:57.900 --> 18:59.560
I had to force you to make a deal.

18:59.690 --> 19:00.990
So I have a history of failure.

19:01.160 --> 19:02.160
That's what you're saying.

19:02.310 --> 19:04.240
You have a history of pride.

19:04.360 --> 19:08.290
Just when you need the ones who love you the most,you shut us out.

19:08.410 --> 19:11.600
But if you--if you'd rather go to the bank,that's fine.

19:11.630 --> 19:12.140
That's fine.

19:12.170 --> 19:12.960
Mom,I'm a businesswoman.

19:13.090 --> 19:16.210
Of course I would prefer to deal with the bank.

19:16.340 --> 19:18.860
Unfortunately,the bank option is no longer available.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.680
Greenatopia can't qualify for a loan without proving income.

19:22.800 --> 19:25.630
We'll never prove income if we can't qualify for a loan.

19:25.760 --> 19:27.480
I can't believe this economy.

19:27.600 --> 19:31.700
You know,if this were at any other time...

19:32.230 --> 19:37.470
maybe you're right.I have screwed up again.

19:37.760 --> 19:39.030
Why don't you take kitty's check?

19:39.170 --> 19:46.060
Because that would be like diving into a lake in the middle of winter in maine.

19:48.660 --> 19:51.810
Well,I'd think about it if I were you.

19:55.600 --> 19:57.770
You remember crawford orchards in the valley,right?

19:57.890 --> 19:58.820
Yeah,sure.

19:58.930 --> 20:00.890
Sold to developers a decade ago.

20:00.920 --> 20:03.370
well,they never built on that land.

20:03.500 --> 20:06.970
Look at this--nearly 2,000 acres already zoned,just sitting there.

20:07.090 --> 20:08.130
Yeah,so?

20:08.160 --> 20:10.810
So we buy it.

20:10.930 --> 20:12.090
Who's "we"--you and holly?

20:12.210 --> 20:12.990
Nope.

20:13.160 --> 20:15.770
-You and me 
-come on,tommy.

20:15.890 --> 20:17.740
That's ridiculous.I'm retired.

20:17.740 --> 20:20.230
I'm--I'm in no position to buy any orchards.

20:20.360 --> 20:20.940
Listen to me.

20:20.970 --> 20:24.010
We--we set up a shell corporation with the two of us as silent owrs.

20:24.210 --> 20:29.460
We make it seem like there's a new grower out there looking to partner up with a company like ojai--

20:29.600 --> 20:33.090
what are you talking about?Ojai doesn't he the kind of cash reserves you need to make a purchase like that.

20:33.230 --> 20:34.230
That's my point.

20:34.380 --> 20:35.820
Ojai will pay in shares.

20:35.890 --> 20:37.230
We'll insist on it.

20:37.370 --> 20:39.040
And once we're offered,say,

20:39.040 --> 20:42.770
10% stake in the company,which we combine with my already existing shar-- okay,tommy,stop.

20:42.770 --> 20:43.870
I don't want to hear anymore.

20:44.020 --> 20:45.410
I see where you're going with this.

20:45.540 --> 20:47.740
You seize majority control,right?

20:47.860 --> 20:52.700
Then you vote a-a new board of directors,and then you fire holly.

20:52.810 --> 20:56.370
Okay,so what do you think?

20:56.480 --> 20:57.010
No.

20:57.130 --> 20:57.740
What do you mean,no?

20:57.880 --> 20:59.760
I mean no.

20:59.880 --> 21:02.760
This is borderline illegal.

21:02.880 --> 21:06.750
You would have t falsify documents in order to withhold your identity in a sale.

21:06.880 --> 21:11.580
Not to mention if holly or anybody on the board of directors ever found out that you were working behind their backs,

21:11.580 --> 21:13.220
you would be out of ojai forever.

21:13.220 --> 21:15.770
Saul,I owe it to my family to get this company back.

21:15.860 --> 21:16.620
This is my shot.

21:16.750 --> 21:18.200
You said you wanted holly out.

21:18.320 --> 21:22.780
I do,but not like this,tommy.

21:22.900 --> 21:25.800
I'm sorry.No.

21:34.170 --> 21:34.830
Are you ready?

21:34.930 --> 21:35.760
Almost.

21:36.750 --> 21:38.420
Thank you so much for coming over.

21:38.540 --> 21:42.200
I,wasn't sure that my voice mail apology was convincing enough.

21:42.320 --> 21:43.470
Oh,it was.It was.

21:43.570 --> 21:47.950
And--and considering how nervous I am,I'm very glad to have the company on the way over.

21:48.040 --> 21:50.260
I really didn't mean to come down on you like that.

21:50.260 --> 21:51.950
I-I guess--you know what?It's the stress.

21:51.970 --> 21:52.950
No,no,it's fine.You know,it was.

21:52.950 --> 21:56.330
It was a little patronizing for me to just show up here with a check.

21:56.450 --> 21:58.760
No,you were very generous,and I had a meltdown.

21:58.880 --> 22:01.590
No,you said no out of self-respect.

22:01.590 --> 22:03.800
you made a lot of good points.

22:03.830 --> 22:04.550
I did?

22:05.000 --> 22:07.390
i mean,what kind of a republican am i

22:07.390 --> 22:14.640
if I don't believe in the power of the individual to achieve his or her own success?

22:14.690 --> 22:20.010
well,the thing is,this indidua has run out of options.

22:20.040 --> 22:22.540
What do you mean?

22:22.650 --> 22:25.990
Kitty,I would like to reconsider your offer.

22:26.010 --> 22:27.490
No.No.

22:27.520 --> 22:29.030
No,no,no,don't do that.

22:29.060 --> 22:30.640
You--you were right the first time.

22:30.760 --> 22:37.040
Maybe I was,but,e business loan that we applied for fell through.

22:37.160 --> 22:38.310
So this is it.

22:38.430 --> 22:39.780
This is the end of the line.

22:39.910 --> 22:42.310
No,there's got to be another way to get a loan.

22:42.430 --> 22:43.680
I mean,what about your home equity line?

22:43.790 --> 22:45.200
A second mortgage on my home?

22:45.660 --> 22:46.620
Are you out of your mind?

22:46.740 --> 22:47.320
I can't do that.

22:47.440 --> 22:49.330
I can't take that kind of risk.

22:49.450 --> 22:53.060
Oh,but it's okay for me to take it?

22:53.210 --> 22:55.330
Well,kitty,you just-- you wrote best seller.

22:55.460 --> 22:57.220
You--you--you're flush.

22:57.240 --> 22:57.880
Flush?

22:57.900 --> 22:58.780
I wrote a book.

22:58.900 --> 23:00.580
I didn't win the lottery.

23:00.610 --> 23:02.860
Right.

23:02.920 --> 23:03.800
great,great.

23:03.920 --> 23:07.280
So I-I finally ask for help,and you,

23:07.400 --> 23:10.230
no,sarah,if you believe in this company as much as you say you do,

23:10.230 --> 23:12.960
then you're gonna have to put more of yourself on the line.

23:12.980 --> 23:18.120
Why don't you just be honest,kitty,and say you never wanted to lend me any money and mom guilted you into it?

23:18.240 --> 23:21.750
Okay,if you mean my first instinct's not to get involved...

23:21.850 --> 23:25.520
look,look,I'm allowed to have reservations,okay?

23:25.640 --> 23:26.510
You said it yourself.

23:26.630 --> 23:28.160
Well,but you-- money and family don't always mix.

23:28.270 --> 23:31.990
That's pretty strange coming from someone who's making a fortune out of writing about hers.

23:32.050 --> 23:32.700
That's not fair.

23:32.810 --> 23:35.710
it is,and if you would stop being so self-righteous,

23:35.720 --> 23:39.430
you would realize how completely ludicrous it is to hear those words come out of your mouth.

23:39.550 --> 23:41.000
I mean,honestly,I'm curious.

23:41.040 --> 23:43.820
Which one of us are you gonna cannibalize tonight?

23:44.660 --> 23:47.820
If you feel that way,why are you coming?

23:47.930 --> 23:49.830
I'm not.

23:49.990 --> 23:51.800
Fine.Stay home.

23:52.130 --> 23:56.710
But you' responsible for your life,not me.

24:05.530 --> 24:08.500
mom,hi.

24:08.610 --> 24:09.940
We're--we're-- we're about to start.

24:10.050 --> 24:11.630
Oh,god.Kitty,what have I done?

24:11.820 --> 24:14.380
Well,I don't know,but you need to sit down now because we're starting.

24:14.490 --> 24:16.080
No£¬Roger

24:16.190 --> 24:17.620
I smashed his model.

24:17.710 --> 24:20.240
And look at this building...

24:20.360 --> 24:21.720
and this building.

24:21.830 --> 24:23.030
Saul was right.

24:23.150 --> 24:25.870
He's not an architect...

24:25.960 --> 24:27.050
he's a poet.

24:27.170 --> 24:28.170
I just didn't understand.

24:28.290 --> 24:29.530
Oh,do you think he'll ever forgive me?

24:29.650 --> 24:32.640
You know,mom,I'm never gonna forgive you if you don't sit dow please.

24:32.840 --> 24:33.940
We're-- we're starting.

24:34.140 --> 24:36.070
I mean-- right,okay.

24:38.080 --> 24:42.740
Senator,believe me,I admire the way you've handled yourself in that snake pit they call D.C.

24:42.900 --> 24:46.600
The last thing that I want is to become a creature of washington.

24:46.740 --> 24:53.150
So I've been thinking more and more about reconnecting with my base in california.

24:53.290 --> 24:55.280
You sound a little homesick.

24:55.280 --> 24:58.170
Maybe I am.

24:58.290 --> 25:00.480
You kn,I've got a shoot coming up soon.

25:00.600 --> 25:02.540
Quail.

25:02.640 --> 25:03.670
You care to join us?

25:03.780 --> 25:06.540
I have a new over-under I've been itching to break out.

25:06.640 --> 25:07.390
How about you,kevin?

25:07.500 --> 25:08.790
You hunt?

25:08.930 --> 25:13.090
you know,a-a democrat in the woods with a bunch of gun-toting republicans...

25:13.230 --> 25:15.200
I don't think "moving target" was part of my job description.

25:15.310 --> 25:16.830
no,I think it's a great idea.

25:16.960 --> 25:18.530
He might actually be the kind of target I can hit.

25:18.650 --> 25:20.430
Oh,now don't be so modest.

25:20.460 --> 25:21.150
Very funny.

25:21.160 --> 25:22.690
No,seriously,kevin,you should join us.

25:22.810 --> 25:25.270
You'd appreciate the california quail.

25:25.380 --> 25:30.420
No matter how far they migrate,they always come home again.

25:30.580 --> 25:32.240
Right,senator?

25:32.350 --> 25:34.890
Yes,they do.

25:35.930 --> 25:40.870
"as with every bipartisan debate,"my family's arguments are never easy or clean.

25:41.000 --> 25:45.870
"They're messy battles,"always hard-won and rarely fought fair.

25:45.990 --> 25:48.540
"But out of our differences,a give-and-take emerges.

25:48.650 --> 25:51.870
"We rally for each other's hardships "and share in each other's triumphs.

25:52.020 --> 25:59.190
"And even when compromise can't be found,our hope for it is never lost.

26:06.310 --> 26:10.280
listen,about the hunting,don't worry.I'm a good enough shot for both of us

26:10.390 --> 26:12.780
I'm not worried about the hunting...

26:12.860 --> 26:13.660
much.

26:13.770 --> 26:17.780
Well,if you're worried about that book signing-- are you running for governor?

26:17.850 --> 26:20.320
"Migrating home." "Being homesick.

26:20.430 --> 26:22.910
" You didn't think I'd realize who we were meeting with?

26:23.020 --> 26:24.370
Kitty asked you to do this,didn't she?

26:24.490 --> 26:26.040
This has nothing to do with ki--I was there.

26:26.040 --> 26:29.470
I saw you practically kissing--please,you and I both know you haven't been in the game long enough

26:29.470 --> 26:33.530
to know the potential implications of that meeting.

26:33.570 --> 26:35.720
I might've said something in passing,but I didn't think it was--

26:35.900 --> 26:38.630
look,I asked you to keep this discreet,and that includes kitty.

26:38.720 --> 26:39.220
I'm sorry.

26:39.230 --> 26:42.420
If you're gonna put your name in the hat for governor,don't you think she has the right to know?

26:42.540 --> 26:44.900
Look,kevin,your job-- is not to lie to my sister.

26:45.030 --> 26:47.320
If she has questions she wants answered,she can come to me.

26:47.320 --> 26:48.630
She doesn't think she'll get the truth from you.

26:48.740 --> 26:49.710
Don't you think that's a problem?

26:49.770 --> 26:54.720
No.Kitty keeping tabs on me through you--that's a problem.

26:54.840 --> 26:57.270
senator,we're here.

26:58.780 --> 27:00.120
Night.

27:01.780 --> 27:03.430
Good night.

27:05.720 --> 27:08.020
How is my little elizabeth doing today?

27:08.130 --> 27:09.460
She's amazing.

27:09.570 --> 27:10.270
As good as new.

27:10.380 --> 27:12.650
I'm so happy for you guys.

27:15.490 --> 27:17.470
it's so weird being back here.

27:17.600 --> 27:20.940
It's like that feeling when you go back to your old high school...

27:21.060 --> 27:22.920
not that I ever attended any of my reunions.

27:23.260 --> 27:25.890
speaking of the old days,

27:25.890 --> 27:31.490
do you remember when youused to wander into my room and want to talk about my hockey team or algebra class,

27:31.490 --> 27:34.710
but really you just had a fight with kitty?

27:36.200 --> 27:37.890
Am I really that transparent?

27:38.000 --> 27:39.480
No.Kevin told me about it.

27:39.600 --> 27:42.250
Did he tell you kitty stormed out of my house twice in two days?

27:42.360 --> 27:44.310
It is like high school.

27:44.430 --> 27:48.770
All we need is mom between the o of you,playing peacemaker.

27:48.870 --> 27:50.100
Are you kidding me?

27:50.220 --> 27:51.110
Mom started this.

27:51.220 --> 27:52.810
She's the reason kitty gave me the check.

27:52.930 --> 27:55.310
Yeah,I heard you acted like it was laced with anthrax.

27:55.420 --> 27:57.400
'Cause I thought I didn't need it until I did.

27:57.510 --> 28:01.950
Then kitty does a 180-degree turn and gives me a lecture about pulling myself up by my bootstraps.

28:01.950 --> 28:03.180
Well,maybe she has a point.

28:03.320 --> 28:05.340
I forgot I was talking to another republican.

28:05.420 --> 28:07.090
It's not about being a republican.

28:07.090 --> 28:09.390
when you ****company

28:09.420 --> 28:12.180
built sth****

28:12.220 --> 28:13.100
that means shouldering the risk.

28:13.220 --> 28:15.620
No,that means taking out a second mortgage on my home

28:15.730 --> 28:24.240
well,if you believe the company will be a success,it is your gamble.

28:24.600 --> 28:27.920
Gambling was dad's thing.

28:28.100 --> 28:30.610
Do you ever envy dad,the way he could just- do whatever it took?

28:30.770 --> 28:34.730
Right.I mean,he took money out of the pension fund to back an investment he believed in.

28:34.810 --> 28:38.780
Son of a bitch-- it paid off.

28:39.170 --> 28:42.310
he'd just tell me to do it,wouldn't he?

28:42.460 --> 28:45.570
He'd just say,"take the risk.

28:45.670 --> 28:49.010
" In a heartbeat.

28:51.960 --> 28:53.440
oh,I'm so proud of you.

28:53.580 --> 28:56.250
You were so poised and articulate.

28:57.860 --> 29:00.270
Well,too bad nobody was there to see it.

29:00.390 --> 29:01.220
What do you mean?

29:01.350 --> 29:02.350
The place was packed.

29:02.460 --> 29:03.670
mom,come on.

29:03.790 --> 29:04.950
Just--just stop it.

29:05.060 --> 29:08.240
I mean--I-I'll be lucky if sarah ever talks to me again,

29:08.240 --> 29:13.650
and my husband is so busy planning his political comeback that he doesn't even-- political comeback?

29:13.650 --> 29:15.660
you know what?It doesn't even matter.

29:16.030 --> 29:19.540
The point is,he wast there.

29:19.590 --> 29:26.090
-No. 
-Is it that impossible to bsupportive or-- or to just be happy for me?

29:26.210 --> 29:28.030
Okay,maybe they feel that way now.So what?

29:28.190 --> 29:29.060
They'll get over it.

29:29.070 --> 29:30.560
Oh,okay.Well,thank you,mother.

29:30.660 --> 29:32.580
You're incredibly empathetic.

29:32.580 --> 29:36.960
You can't sit on your hands so other people will feel better about themselves.

29:37.300 --> 29:39.770
God.Kitty,I did that my whole life.

29:40.110 --> 29:45.910
when I think of all the great ideas I gave your father and just pretended they weren't mine.

29:46.030 --> 29:49.390
And he let me do it,of course.

29:49.510 --> 29:51.520
Sometimes I think,what if I hadn't done that?

29:51.660 --> 29:58.280
What if I had taken credit where credit was due?

29:58.400 --> 30:01.150
I was a more powerful woman than I let myself be.

30:02.530 --> 30:04.530
Yeah,I'll bet.

30:04.720 --> 30:06.650
I don't want you to do that.

30:06.760 --> 30:10.690
I don't want you to make that mistake.

30:11.100 --> 30:17.380
you won't do anyone any good by pretending to be less than what you are.

30:27.610 --> 30:28.450
What's going on?

30:28.490 --> 30:30.350
I'm just reviewing last year's advertising contracts.

30:30.450 --> 30:33.070
You know,a lot of the layouts came in late.

30:33.180 --> 30:34.200
Yeah,don't worry.

30:34.310 --> 30:36.000
Soon,there will be fewer people for you to browbeat.

30:36.230 --> 30:37.850
Why,are there more cuts coming?

30:37.960 --> 30:39.740
Well,if your mom has anything to do with it.

30:39.840 --> 30:43.190
According to her,we're losing money by the minute.

30:43.290 --> 30:44.570
I'm sorry.

30:44.690 --> 30:47.580
We're having a little disagreement over cost-cutting strategies.

30:47.710 --> 30:49.900
I don't--I don't mean to put you in the middle of it.

30:49.980 --> 30:52.760
No,wait.So--so you're not in favor of selling through a wholesaler?

30:52.870 --> 30:56.940
No,I think you can mess with the distribution side of things all you want

30:56.940 --> 31:02.700
but unless we grow all our grapes ourlves,we're always at the mercy of the supplier.I mean,

31:02.720 --> 31:07.120
at the end of the day,they can charge us what they want because we don't own enough land to supply ourselves.

31:07.230 --> 31:11.650
I mean,I think that's what hurts us the most.

31:11.760 --> 31:12.750
But why can't we?

31:12.870 --> 31:15.930
I mean,why-- this may sound stupid-- but why can't we just...

31:16.030 --> 31:18.730
buy more land?

31:18.820 --> 31:21.210
I guess,theoretically,we can.

31:21.330 --> 31:24.570
I mean,it tak years for orchards to cultivate,

31:24.570 --> 31:29.330
and maybe there's a grower out there with enough acreage...it's a long shot.

31:29.330 --> 31:31.690
But don't you think that we should investigate it?

31:31.800 --> 31:35.330
You know,I was looking at all of the new marketing that we would have to do if we do decide to switch over to selling wholesale,

31:35.330 --> 31:37.910
and it changes the whole identity of our brand.

31:38.840 --> 31:42.780
You know,I hadn't thought about it from that angle,but maybe you're right.

31:42.900 --> 31:48.090
Maybe it's something we should pursue.

31:48.210 --> 31:49.610
Do youind if I run it by my mom?

31:49.720 --> 31:51.640
No,it's-- it's your idea.

31:51.760 --> 31:53.440
I'd--I'd support it.

31:53.550 --> 31:55.080
Really?

31:55.410 --> 31:56.700
thank you,tommy.

31:56.810 --> 31:58.300
Anytime.

32:05.400 --> 32:06.690
I'm checking on the rebar now.

32:08.160 --> 32:09.050
Anyway...

32:11.730 --> 32:13.700
no,thank you.

32:13.830 --> 32:17.490
I,I don't need any demolition work today.

32:17.620 --> 32:20.800
Yes,well,I guess I deserved that.

32:20.930 --> 32:24.030
may I speak with you privately,please?

32:24.170 --> 32:25.580
Of course.

32:28.130 --> 32:33.040
Look,if you have something serious to say,you'd better remove that hat.

32:33.180 --> 32:34.080
Why,does it look ridiculous?

32:34.220 --> 32:39.360
No,you look adorable,actually.

32:39.480 --> 32:40.350
Yes...

32:40.450 --> 32:45.830
well,roger,it has come to my attention that I'm a nincompoop.

32:47.120 --> 32:51.960
I've been giving myself a crash course in architecture,primarily everything roger grant.

32:52.080 --> 32:57.400
And I-I realized that you're--you're a-A...

32:57.400 --> 32:58.380
I think the word you're searching for is "genius.

32:58.480 --> 32:59.480
" I was gonna say "visionary.

32:59.590 --> 33:00.540
" Oh,that's apt as well you were right.

33:00.640 --> 33:01.890
I am inexperienced.

33:02.020 --> 33:09.360
I-I didn't understand your style and your passion for modern design,but I-I do now,or I'm-- I'm--I'm starting to.

33:09.470 --> 33:10.580
Well,I'm glad.

33:10.700 --> 33:12.170
Thank you.

33:12.260 --> 33:15.840
So shall we proceed from my plans?

33:15.950 --> 33:17.110
No.

33:19.320 --> 33:22.830
You see,I have a vision,too,and I am as passionate about that as you are about yours.

33:22.950 --> 33:26.180
Roger,your buildings-- they're your legacy.

33:26.290 --> 33:28.530
They'll last a hundred years or more.

33:28.670 --> 33:33.760
But up till now,my legacy's been my children and my grandchildren.

33:33.870 --> 33:41.980
I'm very proud of that,but the center is-- is my chance to create something solid and--and useful that didn't exist before I imagined it.

33:42.160 --> 33:45.800
I-I've waited my whole life to create something like that.

33:45.920 --> 33:52.710
I can't just hand it over to somebody else,even if that someone else is as talented...

33:52.810 --> 33:55.540
as you are.

33:56.550 --> 33:58.520
I completely understand.

33:58.530 --> 33:59.120
You do?

33:59.160 --> 34:00.670
And I won't leave you in the lurch.

34:00.790 --> 34:02.960
I'll assign my best young associate.

34:03.060 --> 34:04.900
Mr.Chao!

34:04.940 --> 34:10.469
well,I wa--I was hoping that m-maybe it would-- competing visions never work out,but yore in safe hands.

34:10.570 --> 34:14.699
In fact,christopher built the model sed on my design.

34:14.820 --> 34:16.570
He's a brilliant young man.

34:16.670 --> 34:18.400
Christopher,I believe you know mrs.Walker.

34:18.540 --> 34:19.630
Nice to see you again.

34:19.750 --> 34:24.469
You will be working with her to come up with a new design for her center.

34:24.600 --> 34:26.790
I'd be honored.

34:30.530 --> 34:33.340
Sorry about the model.

34:35.380 --> 34:36.790
come in.

34:37.230 --> 34:38.320
What's up?

34:38.699 --> 34:41.330
I'm sorry I snapped at you last night.

34:41.449 --> 34:44.190
This who familial conflict of interest...

34:44.310 --> 34:44.969
it's confusing.

34:45.090 --> 34:47.000
Yes,it is,and you know what?

34:47.100 --> 34:48.150
It can't be.

34:48.260 --> 34:52.770
I need to be able to know that I can talk to you as a trusted member of my political team.

34:52.880 --> 34:53.770
I agree.

34:53.880 --> 34:56.500
It's the same conclusion I came to last night.

34:56.590 --> 34:59.380
good,good,'cause,um...

34:59.490 --> 35:02.400
kevin,I'm running for governor.

35:02.540 --> 35:03.180
You are?

35:03.310 --> 35:05.050
Yeah,and I'm not ready to talk to kitty about this.

35:05.160 --> 35:08.190
Once I get what I need in place,kitty will be the first to know.

35:08.300 --> 35:12.020
And in the meantime?

35:12.130 --> 35:16.280
I'm not asking you to lie to your sister,but I'm not talking to you as your brother-in-law.

35:16.400 --> 35:20.180
I'm talking to you as someone who wants you to be a crucial part of this campaign.

35:20.300 --> 35:23.540
Now whether you want to do it or not,that's up to you.

35:23.650 --> 35:29.680
But I think,together,you and I can great things.

35:36.400 --> 35:38.350
I'm here to meet the author.

35:38.470 --> 35:42.070
Sarah,sarah,I can't-- I can't keep going back and forth like this with you.

35:42.170 --> 35:44.330
Come on,I'm not here about the money.

35:44.430 --> 35:47.810
You were right not to give me the money.

35:47.910 --> 35:48.530
I was?

35:48.650 --> 35:49.530
Yes.

35:49.630 --> 35:56.510
I can't expect you to take a risk for me that I'm not willing to take for myself I've applied for a second mortgage.

36:00.030 --> 36:00.860
Good for you.

36:01.940 --> 36:03.880
Good for me.

36:03.990 --> 36:06.310
I do believe in my company,kitty.

36:06.410 --> 36:08.350
And if it doesn't work out...

36:08.460 --> 36:10.040
how many bedrooms do you have here?

36:10.370 --> 36:12.080
could you imagine?

36:12.090 --> 36:15.130
Coop would break everything you own.

36:15.140 --> 36:16.370
Coop?What about you and me?

36:16.370 --> 36:18.940
We barely made it to adulthood under one roof.

36:19.060 --> 36:19.870
that's true.

36:19.970 --> 36:21.350
Thank god for summer camp.

36:21.460 --> 36:22.650
Otherwise,one of us would be dead.

36:22.750 --> 36:25.960
The other would be in jail.

36:26.220 --> 36:30.030
You know,it's--it not that I-I don't want to be there for you,sarah.

36:30.140 --> 36:33.040
It's-- I know.

36:33.150 --> 36:34.920
You were.

36:35.020 --> 36:37.030
You are.

36:37.120 --> 36:39.740
But you know what dad would've said?

36:39.850 --> 36:41.900
"Always bet on yourself.

36:42.030 --> 36:44.670
" Yeah.

36:45.060 --> 36:47.180
He was right.

36:50.310 --> 36:56.940
Let's just hope the bank thinks I'm a good bet.

36:59.960 --> 37:06.890
You know,uh,maybe there is one thing I could do.

37:07.020 --> 37:09.740
So when the title search comes in,you'll be good to go.

37:09.860 --> 37:12.740
And nce you are acting as guarantor,you'll need to come in,too.

37:12.860 --> 37:14.500
Oh,okay,well,that's no problem.

37:14.710 --> 37:16.910
We'll,we'll make a day of it.

37:17.440 --> 37:19.010
So the funds will be deposited then?

37:19.110 --> 37:20.350
Exactly.

37:20.450 --> 37:21.220
Great.

37:21.320 --> 37:22.170
All right then.

37:22.280 --> 37:23.350
That should do it.

37:23.460 --> 37:25.120
I'll just run off a copy for your records.

37:25.220 --> 37:26.230
Thank you.

37:28.120 --> 37:30.900
My hand hurts.

37:31.040 --> 37:31.730
Oh,really?

37:31.860 --> 37:38.270
Because I was hoping that you would sign one more thing.

37:39.200 --> 37:40.460
-Oh,sarah...  -no.

37:40.490 --> 37:41.990
Sarah,no,no,you don't have to do that.

37:42.110 --> 37:42.780
Please.

37:42.900 --> 37:45.190
I hate that I wasn't there.

37:45.300 --> 37:47.400
I'm sorry.

37:47.670 --> 37:49.320
All right.

37:54.120 --> 37:55.420
thanks.

37:59.570 --> 38:00.910
Christopher?

38:01.020 --> 38:02.690
I'm so excited.

38:02.800 --> 38:03.530
I love it.

38:03.640 --> 38:04.680
It's--it's perfect.

38:04.690 --> 38:08.020
It's fresh and new and traditional all at the same time.

38:08.090 --> 38:12.620
mrs.Walker-- and I love that it feels like a roger grant design,only quieter.

38:12.730 --> 38:18.880
It's like you listenedo him and you listened to me and you amalgamated our visions together into one perfect union.

38:22.200 --> 38:23.230
Roger.

38:23.350 --> 38:24.440
I didn't know you were here.

38:24.580 --> 38:28.790
You'rehris have to give christopher a raise and a promotion.

38:28.810 --> 38:29.600
He's very talented.

38:29.600 --> 38:32.230
I don't like to throw around the word "genius," but-- oh,I...

38:32.240 --> 38:35.940
didn't do it,mrs.Walker.It wasn't my design.

38:36.050 --> 38:37.970
It was his.

38:40.990 --> 38:41.840
You did these?

38:41.970 --> 38:43.020
I had to.

38:43.130 --> 38:48.100
Christopher was frightened there might be violence if you didn't like what he came up with.

38:48.240 --> 38:50.530
Well,I-I hope you didn't have to compromise your vision.

38:50.830 --> 38:56.000
I never compromise my vision,but it's been a very long time since someone turned me down on anything.

38:56.100 --> 39:00.560
It was,bracing.

39:00.960 --> 39:01.990
Is that a compliment?

39:02.110 --> 39:03.400
It was more of a compliment to myself.

39:03.500 --> 39:04.560
Do you do that often?

39:04.590 --> 39:06.740
Never enough.

39:08.110 --> 39:10.020
Nora,your ideas were good.

39:10.130 --> 39:11.280
I respect your vision.

39:11.390 --> 39:15.710
And I suppose I like a challenge.

39:15.850 --> 39:16.910
What are those,new drawings?

39:17.030 --> 39:17.640
Yes.

39:17.750 --> 39:18.750
Do you want to have a look?

39:18.860 --> 39:20.050
Oh,it's the kitchen.

39:20.170 --> 39:23.790
I thought the parents might like to have a communal area where they can make supper together.

39:23.900 --> 39:26.210
Do you really think that's enough counter space?

39:26.220 --> 39:27.750
Ooh,no,no,no.

39:27.750 --> 39:29.840
when's the last time you did any cooking?

39:29.950 --> 39:35.140
No,no,no,you've gotta bring that out,like way out like that,and...

39:35.280 --> 39:41.990
so I was talking to rebecca about teaming up with an outside grower,owning more orchards.

39:42.100 --> 39:44.490
Yeah,I think that has some real potential.

39:44.690 --> 39:45.310
What do you think?

39:45.430 --> 39:48.740
It certainly is another way for us to keep our costs down.

39:48.850 --> 39:55.840
I mean,I have been thinking about your reservations,and maybe I was a little too focused on short-term.

39:55.950 --> 39:58.930
Maybe wholesale is not the way to go.

39:59.040 --> 40:04.900
You know,I have to say,when rebecca first started speculating about this,it made sense.

40:06.250 --> 40:08.030
You know,she has a knack,holly.

40:08.130 --> 40:09.360
I know.

40:09.460 --> 40:12.070
I have been astounded.

40:12.180 --> 40:16.060
I never would've guessed that she would take to business like this.

40:16.170 --> 40:19.350
You should be proud.

40:19.470 --> 40:20.750
I am.

40:20.860 --> 40:23.330
I,I've got a lot of relationships with growers in the valley.

40:23.440 --> 40:26.000
Why don't I,why don't I make a call?

40:26.100 --> 40:26.610
Great.

40:26.730 --> 40:28.760
Let me know what you find out.

40:28.880 --> 40:31.190
Of course.

40:31.440 --> 40:35.580
It's nice to be back on the same page.

40:35.690 --> 40:37.330
It is.

40:45.160 --> 40:47.170
Did you find out anything?

40:47.280 --> 40:49.130
Yeah,yeah,I meant to call you.

40:49.240 --> 40:50.720
He's not running.

40:51.690 --> 40:52.710
Oh,thank god.

40:52.830 --> 40:54.360
But,hey,I mean,you know him.

40:54.480 --> 40:55.590
It doesn't mean he's not gonna be busy.

40:55.880 --> 40:57.590
He's a--he's a senator.

40:57.700 --> 40:59.020
Well,I know.I don't care.

40:59.040 --> 41:02.020
I was just terrified that I was gonna spend the first couple of months of my baby's life,

41:02.020 --> 41:04.850
you know,working the crowds in cucamonga.

41:04.880 --> 41:06.490
-there you are. 
-Well,hey.

41:06.490 --> 41:07.960
-Ready to go to lunch? -Well,yeah,yeah.

41:08.140 --> 41:09.780
I'm--I'm starving.

41:09.860 --> 41:11.180
You seem like you're in a good mood.

41:11.270 --> 41:13.570
Yeah,well,actually,I am.

41:13.690 --> 41:16.890
I like it.

41:16.910 --> 41:17.820
Should we go?

41:18.890 --> 41:21.860
We'll see you later,kev.

41:21.980 --> 41:23.400
Have a great time.

41:23.530 --> 41:26.110
Thanks.
