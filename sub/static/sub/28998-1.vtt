00:48.547 --> 00:51.650
<i>Once there was
a girl who was invisible.</i>

00:54.420 --> 00:56.688
<i>No one could see her.</i>

00:56.690 --> 00:58.457
<i>And no one could hear her.</i>

01:02.528 --> 01:04.528
<i>She wasn't a ghost.</i>

01:04.530 --> 01:08.400
<i>Her invisibility was simply
a fact she had to live with.</i>

01:12.671 --> 01:13.706
<i>That girl is me.</i>

01:18.811 --> 01:21.879
- This looks amazing honey!
- Good!

01:21.881 --> 01:24.581
<i>My older sister
was the pretty one.</i>

01:24.583 --> 01:25.816
Melody is such a cow.

01:25.818 --> 01:28.385
How come she can eat
whatever she wants?

01:28.387 --> 01:31.688
Cows only eat grass, stupid.
And they have a four-part stomach.

01:31.690 --> 01:34.423
<i>My little brother
was the smart one.</i>

01:34.425 --> 01:39.330
Wanna bet? The rumen, the reticulum,
the omasum and the abomasum.

01:40.099 --> 01:43.100
- Quit showing off.
- Quit tossing your hair.

01:43.102 --> 01:45.369
<i>Dad was generally
clueless.</i>

01:45.371 --> 01:51.875
How about we enjoy this amazing
dinner your mother made? Mmm.

01:51.877 --> 01:54.847
- Troy...
- <i>And I was the middle child.</i>

01:55.781 --> 01:57.883
Those green beans
are to die for.

01:59.451 --> 02:01.453
Troy, sweetie.
Holly hasn't had any.

02:02.155 --> 02:03.856
<i>Luckily there was Mom.</i>

02:05.791 --> 02:06.927
Thank you. Hmm.

02:08.794 --> 02:11.329
<i>Mom was interested
in everything.</i>

02:12.631 --> 02:17.803
<i>To her the world was full of wonder
and mystery. A puzzle to be solved.</i>

02:18.604 --> 02:21.607
See how much it changes when
you rotate it even slightly?

02:23.143 --> 02:26.810
Yeah. It's a kaleidoscope.

02:26.812 --> 02:31.748
See, I'm fascinated by the fact that you
can rearrange the same shapes and colors

02:31.750 --> 02:33.586
and get a whole new pattern.

02:36.689 --> 02:39.825
That is the look that means I
don't want to hurt her feelings

02:40.626 --> 02:42.892
but I'd rather be doing
my algebra homework.

02:42.894 --> 02:44.596
- Pre-Algebra.
- Mm-hm.

02:46.631 --> 02:47.700
Alright, get out.

02:50.501 --> 02:55.474
<i>When she got sick, I wasn't worried
because they said the treatments were working.</i>

03:00.945 --> 03:04.547
- What's a simile?
- It's an analogy.

03:04.549 --> 03:06.582
Like um...

03:06.584 --> 03:11.922
If I say to you, I love you
like bread loves butter.

03:11.924 --> 03:12.791
Oh.

03:13.759 --> 03:15.226
So like...

03:15.228 --> 03:18.728
I love you like laundry
loves laundry detergent?

03:19.831 --> 03:24.970
Exactly. Or I love you
like... A foot loves a sock.

03:30.809 --> 03:32.876
Ow, it hurts!

03:32.878 --> 03:34.846
Oh no... should we
call you a doctor?

03:37.216 --> 03:39.952
- No, no, no, no!
- Tender knees...

03:49.561 --> 03:51.829
<i>Then mom died,
and everything changed.</i>

03:56.668 --> 03:58.736
<i>Without her, I began to fade.</i>

04:04.743 --> 04:06.543
<i>It started at home.</i>

04:06.545 --> 04:10.012
Vanessa, are you feeling okay?
You haven't eaten anything.

04:10.014 --> 04:13.718
I just can't have carbs.
I'll puff up like a blowfish.

04:16.553 --> 04:18.623
Troy? How's school going?

04:19.589 --> 04:20.458
Fine.

04:22.628 --> 04:23.595
That's great.

04:25.897 --> 04:27.665
You didn't ask me anything.

04:28.866 --> 04:29.767
What's that?

04:31.069 --> 04:32.868
Forget it.

04:32.870 --> 04:33.705
Okay.

04:49.754 --> 04:52.755
<i>And then it spread
to other areas of my life.</i>

04:52.757 --> 04:56.960
Just to review,
everyone is reading chapters two and three.

04:56.962 --> 04:59.998
And doing the study questions
in the back of the book.

05:01.065 --> 05:03.501
Does anybody
have any questions?

05:05.103 --> 05:07.505
- Nobody?
- I have a question.

05:09.041 --> 05:11.741
Okay then, have a good weekend.

05:11.743 --> 05:12.577
What?

05:18.750 --> 05:22.018
<i>And by the end of
the summer, I was gone.</i>

05:22.920 --> 05:24.088
How come nobody woke me up?

05:25.723 --> 05:28.060
Vanessa, would you stop
for a second and look at me?

05:29.361 --> 05:30.062
Ugh!

05:30.896 --> 05:33.065
Troy, I specifically
told you... hey!

05:34.665 --> 05:36.632
What I wouldn't give
for a good night's sleep.

05:36.634 --> 05:38.601
Dad, Troy and Vanessa
are ignoring me again.

05:38.603 --> 05:41.670
Where did your mom keep
the camera? Here we go.

05:41.672 --> 05:44.575
Does nobody care that I'm going to
be late for the first day of school?

05:46.078 --> 05:47.812
- Dad!
- Aahh!

05:49.348 --> 05:50.149
What the hell was that?

05:51.983 --> 05:55.951
Uh, gotta capture the first day of school.
Get over by the window.

05:55.953 --> 05:57.021
Ugh...

05:58.956 --> 06:00.089
It's gonna be backlit.

06:00.091 --> 06:01.757
It'll be perfect.

06:01.759 --> 06:03.961
I want to be in it too.
Thanks for asking.

06:07.832 --> 06:08.799
Perfect.

06:12.403 --> 06:13.636
That's a keeper.

06:13.638 --> 06:14.904
God, I have a double chin.

06:14.906 --> 06:16.707
The lighting is horrible.

06:19.043 --> 06:20.176
I'm not there.

06:20.178 --> 06:21.579
I think it's great.

06:23.981 --> 06:27.985
What's happening? Why are
you all pretending I'm not here?

06:30.121 --> 06:32.123
<i>But they
weren't pretending.</i>

06:59.749 --> 07:04.019
<i>I didn't want to accept it,
but I had disappeared</i>

07:04.021 --> 07:06.991
<i>from sight and from memory.</i>

07:08.426 --> 07:10.661
<i>It was like I never existed.</i>

07:20.770 --> 07:24.909
<i>I guess it's like anything.
Eventually you adapt.</i>

07:34.050 --> 07:36.452
Hello. Delivery.

07:36.454 --> 07:38.256
Does it say to ring twice?

07:49.066 --> 07:52.270
<i>All things considered,
I live a pretty normal life.</i>

07:53.170 --> 07:57.108
<i>I have my own place in a building
that does corporate rentals.</i>

07:58.209 --> 08:01.812
<i>Nobody knows anybody,
so I fit right in.</i>

08:14.158 --> 08:15.960
<i>And I have a job.</i>

08:29.873 --> 08:31.808
<i>Mostly, I work nights.</i>

09:39.075 --> 09:41.344
I'll be right back.
Gotta take care of something, alright?

09:59.963 --> 10:01.095
We ain't got a lot of time.

10:01.097 --> 10:05.100
You suck, Bobby. Besides,
you're a married man now.

10:05.102 --> 10:08.104
Come on, you know me and her
are just for show. Come here.

10:19.082 --> 10:23.619
<i>If you think I feel bad
about what I do, you'd be wrong.</i>

10:23.621 --> 10:25.388
<i>I show people
as they really are.</i>

10:28.925 --> 10:33.330
Pretty terrific, huh? I'm
telling you, this girl is good.

10:34.097 --> 10:35.597
Thank you.

10:35.599 --> 10:39.635
And she delivers. Always delivers.
No muss, no fuss. And she's cheap!

10:39.637 --> 10:42.303
- Not anymore, I'm not.
- Yeah.

10:42.305 --> 10:43.237
Couldn't be happier.

10:43.239 --> 10:46.207
Yeah. It's great.

10:50.980 --> 10:53.883
Hang on for a minute.
Who the hell is this?

10:54.984 --> 10:56.150
Who is this?

10:56.152 --> 11:00.889
Oh for heaven's sake.
I just sent you the cover photo.

11:02.659 --> 11:07.063
That's it. This girl has a sixth sense.
I don't know how she does it.

11:09.667 --> 11:10.867
What the hell is this?

11:13.103 --> 11:16.939
<i>As for my family,
Troy still lives at home.</i>

11:18.006 --> 11:21.010
<i>He moved to the basement
as a teenager, for the view.</i>

11:23.279 --> 11:27.917
<i>It's what supposedly inspired
his career as a visual artist.</i>

11:30.488 --> 11:36.393
<i>Troy has been working on an experimental film
called</i> Top Ten Legs of the Last Decade <i>for...</i>

11:37.160 --> 11:38.428
<i>well, the last decade.</i>

11:41.297 --> 11:43.400
<i>And using our mother's
legs as a benchmark.</i>

11:47.971 --> 11:52.442
<i>Vanessa had remained her own number
one fan until she married Marjus,</i>

11:53.208 --> 11:55.443
<i>a Lithuanian elevator inspector.</i>

11:55.445 --> 11:58.948
Come on baby.
We're gonna be late.

12:03.052 --> 12:05.522
- How do I look?
- Perfect.

12:09.024 --> 12:10.190
Come, come, come.

12:10.192 --> 12:12.928
<i>And with that,
she doubled her fan club.</i>

12:15.298 --> 12:19.066
<i>And Dad had found a new love
in commercial real-estate.</i>

12:19.068 --> 12:24.374
You guys go ahead. I might have found
a buyer for this incredible granary.

12:25.340 --> 12:27.510
<i>Friday night dinner
is still a tradition</i>

12:28.310 --> 12:31.245
<i>although Marjus is usually held up at work.</i>

12:31.247 --> 12:34.482
Hey. Yeah. Yeah, I figured.

12:34.484 --> 12:36.419
What floor are you on?

12:38.087 --> 12:41.088
Vanessa, you haven't
eaten anything.

12:41.090 --> 12:43.125
Um, meat makes me nauseous.

12:47.229 --> 12:50.198
Troy, how's the job
search coming?

12:50.200 --> 12:52.368
That depends
on how you define job.

12:53.169 --> 12:54.502
Why do you
have to be so obnoxious?

12:54.504 --> 12:57.273
- Well why do you have to be so obtuse?
- Enough!

12:58.308 --> 13:00.574
No, not you. No, I love you.

13:00.576 --> 13:02.375
<i>Not much has changed.</i>

13:06.181 --> 13:08.384
<i>My favorite things
about being invisible...</i>

13:09.486 --> 13:13.223
<i>Going anywhere,
seeing everything,</i>

13:14.257 --> 13:18.126
<i>not having to worry about
rules or good manners,</i>

13:20.262 --> 13:22.599
<i>or even caring what I look like.</i>

13:23.833 --> 13:26.068
<i>Never feeling ashamed
or embarrassed.</i>

13:28.304 --> 13:33.142
<i>The worst thing is not
being a part of anything.</i>

13:47.490 --> 13:50.460
Let's all
have another round!

13:53.395 --> 13:55.163
I think I need to lie down.

14:07.210 --> 14:08.110
Hey!

14:09.177 --> 14:10.078
Hey, you!

14:12.214 --> 14:13.048
Hey!

14:14.383 --> 14:16.251
Why are you following
those people?

14:18.655 --> 14:19.453
Alright.

14:19.455 --> 14:20.557
You can see me?

14:23.192 --> 14:25.225
Ever heard of respecting
people's privacy?

14:25.227 --> 14:26.626
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

14:26.628 --> 14:27.861
- This conversation is over.
- Blackwell!

14:27.863 --> 14:28.730
Wait!

14:29.598 --> 14:31.197
- I'm not letting you back in.
- Wait!

14:31.199 --> 14:32.265
Blackwell, we need you in there.

14:32.267 --> 14:33.468
Wait, don't go, I was just...

14:35.437 --> 14:37.339
Can you see me?

14:43.278 --> 14:44.212
Hello?

14:55.625 --> 14:58.661
Mom, you'll never
believe what happened.

15:00.529 --> 15:02.364
I met someone
who can see me.

15:05.300 --> 15:06.635
He could hear me too.

15:09.271 --> 15:10.707
Just some random bouncer.

15:13.910 --> 15:18.280
But the bad news is that I'm
still invisible to everyone else.

15:20.616 --> 15:25.287
So I... I don't know
what that means. I really...

15:30.258 --> 15:32.294
I don't know how to
put the pieces together.

15:42.404 --> 15:43.672
<i>What's
wrong, little bird?</i>

15:45.207 --> 15:47.476
What's going to happen
when you die?

15:52.748 --> 15:54.683
I'll be with you in spirit.

15:56.218 --> 15:57.586
Do you know what that means?

16:00.222 --> 16:05.728
It means that the wind will carry
me to you, whenever you need me.

16:06.528 --> 16:08.597
- Yeah, right.
- It will.

16:09.965 --> 16:11.232
You'll see.

16:12.467 --> 16:14.202
How come you'll be in the wind?

16:15.971 --> 16:17.305
Because

16:18.306 --> 16:19.341
the wind

16:19.976 --> 16:22.177
is the soul's messenger.

16:23.746 --> 16:26.581
But if I can't see you,
how will I know you're there?

16:29.451 --> 16:31.520
Because you'll feel loved.

17:19.800 --> 17:21.703
<i>That's when
it dawned on me.</i>

17:22.570 --> 17:25.406
<i>What if he wasn't
some random bouncer?</i>

17:27.041 --> 17:28.643
<i>What if we were connected?</i>

17:30.846 --> 17:33.645
<i>Shayne Blackwell,
former world champion</i>

17:33.647 --> 17:38.651
<i>and one of the most sought-after
fighters in MMA is now all but forgotten.</i>

17:38.653 --> 17:42.088
<i>What happened? Shayne
Blackwell first on to the scene</i>

17:42.090 --> 17:45.525
<i>with a series of unexpected
wins against veteran fighters.</i>

17:45.527 --> 17:47.727
<i>From there, his career took off.</i>

17:47.729 --> 17:50.662
<i>Fans latched onto
his rags to riches story</i>

17:50.664 --> 17:55.334
<i>and he caught the eye of actress
and supermodel, Julianna King.</i>

17:55.336 --> 17:59.072
<i>Shayne and Julianna became
the "it" couple of the moment.</i>

17:59.074 --> 18:00.707
<i>Until this.</i>

18:00.709 --> 18:05.478
<i>These photos of Blackwell caught
cheating on Julianna quickly went viral.</i>

18:05.480 --> 18:07.081
<i>The breakup was immediate.</i>

18:07.083 --> 18:09.548
<i>Shayne's fans
turned against him.</i>

18:09.550 --> 18:12.417
<i>And his life spiraled
out of control.</i>

18:12.419 --> 18:16.756
<i>It all came to a hit at the
championship fight against Attila Matae.</i>

18:16.758 --> 18:19.492
<i>Blackwell had been
an early favorite to win.</i>

18:19.494 --> 18:22.729
<i>Instead, he suffered
a crushing defeat by Matae.</i>

18:22.731 --> 18:25.697
<i>Maybe it's karma.
Cheaters never win.</i>

18:25.699 --> 18:28.302
<i>Thanks for watching.
Tune in next week.</i>

18:37.913 --> 18:39.481
Shayne Blackwell?

18:41.616 --> 18:43.715
Do you remember me?

18:43.717 --> 18:45.786
Vaguely. What do you want?

18:49.690 --> 18:51.490
You think I haven't seen
this picture a hundred times?

18:51.492 --> 18:54.896
I took it. I took that picture.

18:57.766 --> 19:00.699
- Why are you telling me this?
- I... I want...

19:00.701 --> 19:02.770
- I...
- That picture destroyed my life.

19:03.737 --> 19:05.704
- I know.
- No, you don't know.

19:05.706 --> 19:08.607
But you don't care. Makes you feel
better about your own sorry life.

19:08.609 --> 19:09.876
You're probably right.

19:09.878 --> 19:11.476
Stay away from me.

19:11.478 --> 19:12.614
I can't.

19:13.882 --> 19:14.883
You can't?

19:15.717 --> 19:17.751
You're the only
person who can...

19:19.486 --> 19:20.387
Who can what?

19:22.690 --> 19:24.391
I want to make it up to you.

19:25.626 --> 19:27.461
You want to make it up to me?

19:28.763 --> 19:29.931
You want to make it up to me?

19:31.967 --> 19:35.767
Alright yeah, uh, so yeah, you just
gotta fix my reputation. You gotta...

19:35.769 --> 19:39.972
you gotta restart my fighting career. And
then you gotta get me back with Julianna.

19:39.974 --> 19:42.841
That's it. If you do all that,
you'll have made it up to me.

19:42.843 --> 19:45.646
I can fix your image. I can.

19:46.547 --> 19:48.815
And I could help
with your career.

19:48.817 --> 19:51.852
I don't know about your
girlfriend but I can try.

19:53.187 --> 19:54.054
You're crazy.

19:54.889 --> 19:57.456
What...? I'm trying to help.

19:57.458 --> 20:00.826
- Do you mind? I got somewhere to be.
- I don't mind at all, no.

20:00.828 --> 20:02.794
I mean, get lost. We're done.

20:02.796 --> 20:04.598
But that's not what you said.

20:06.234 --> 20:09.801
Look, I'm gonna meet my manager over there.
I got some business to take care of.

20:09.803 --> 20:11.536
Give me five minutes
in there with you.

20:11.538 --> 20:16.742
If you don't think after five minutes that
I can help you, then I'll leave you alone.

20:16.744 --> 20:18.545
And you have to
promise to ignore me.

20:20.581 --> 20:21.548
Done.

20:25.686 --> 20:28.656
Yay! Hey! There
he is. The champ!

20:29.723 --> 20:32.557
- What's up, brother?
- Not much, same old.

20:32.559 --> 20:36.561
- How about you?
- Ah, you know, maintaining.

20:36.563 --> 20:39.665
Trying to make this million.
Trying to make you rich.

20:39.667 --> 20:43.268
Basically no information
has been exchanged so far.

20:43.270 --> 20:45.837
- What are you doing?
- G&T.

20:45.839 --> 20:46.672
You?

20:46.674 --> 20:48.640
Don't talk to me.
That's the deal.

20:48.642 --> 20:50.709
- Pops!
- And right about now you're gonna start to wonder

20:50.711 --> 20:53.979
why it is that he
doesn't seem to notice me.

20:53.981 --> 20:56.249
Double Scotch.

20:56.251 --> 20:57.751
G&T, Double Scotch.

20:59.186 --> 21:03.958
So beat this, huh? I got an offer
for you to book you on a live show.

21:05.025 --> 21:05.993
What kind of show?

21:06.961 --> 21:08.894
Celebrity Poker Rodeo.

21:08.896 --> 21:10.829
- Never heard of it.
- Are you serious?

21:10.831 --> 21:14.000
It's where a bunch of has-beens
play poker in front of an audience.

21:14.002 --> 21:18.536
Dude, you shoot the breeze with a
couple of celebrities. And that's it.

21:18.538 --> 21:20.973
- Simple.
- Has-beens.

21:20.975 --> 21:23.041
- Are you hearing this?
- What?

21:23.043 --> 21:26.013
Hold on.

21:28.916 --> 21:32.751
Oohoo! Oooohh. It's the wife.

21:32.753 --> 21:34.920
Definitely not his wife.

21:34.922 --> 21:36.890
So what's up?
You gonna do this or what?

21:37.992 --> 21:40.894
Is that all you got?
When's it start?

21:42.096 --> 21:43.497
Let's see.

21:44.832 --> 21:48.033
It's next Tuesday, as long as
you stay in the game once a week.

21:48.035 --> 21:51.769
How much does it pay?
Eight hundred dollars a pop.

21:51.771 --> 21:54.942
It says fifteen hundred here.
Just so you know.

21:56.609 --> 21:58.544
I thought it was
fifteen hundred.

22:00.314 --> 22:01.880
Who told you that?

22:01.882 --> 22:06.618
Just something I thought
you said last time.

22:06.620 --> 22:07.820
Oh yeah? Let me check.

22:10.124 --> 22:13.325
Mm, I see it. It's right there.

22:13.327 --> 22:15.696
Fifteen hundred. Even sweeter.

22:16.363 --> 22:17.530
Talk to me.

22:19.733 --> 22:21.833
I'll be outside when
you want to talk.

22:21.835 --> 22:25.337
Champ, this is what you've been
waiting for. Exposure. Play some poker.

22:25.339 --> 22:28.942
They're gonna be like, "Who is this guy? Look
how brolic he looks. I want to fight him."

22:29.876 --> 22:31.111
So sup, you in or what?

22:39.387 --> 22:40.687
What was that in there?

22:41.687 --> 22:43.821
It's uh, it's complicated.

22:43.823 --> 22:44.690
Okay.

22:46.026 --> 22:49.830
It sounds really crazy to um...

22:50.663 --> 22:51.695
to say it.

22:51.697 --> 22:53.967
- Say what?
- That I'm a...

22:56.737 --> 22:57.738
I'm invisible.

23:00.973 --> 23:03.941
What does that
mean you're invisible?

23:03.943 --> 23:04.777
Well...

23:06.113 --> 23:10.918
Not to you, obviously.
But to everyone else.

23:11.852 --> 23:12.653
Right.

23:13.754 --> 23:17.121
- You don't believe me?
- No, I don't.

23:17.123 --> 23:20.059
Well didn't you see what just...
just happened in there?

23:21.128 --> 23:24.963
How do you think that I take my pictures?
I don't use a fancy lens.

23:24.965 --> 23:27.000
I don't have to.
I'm-I'm right there.

23:28.135 --> 23:31.171
Okay, you know what? I don't
need to know what your trick is.

23:32.439 --> 23:36.943
You want me to prove it to you?
Fine. I'll-I'll prove it to you.

23:41.781 --> 23:43.014
What are you doing?
Get out of the street.

23:43.016 --> 23:45.417
If he sees me, he's
gonna stop, right?

23:45.419 --> 23:47.988
And not if he's drunk.
Get out of the street.

23:48.889 --> 23:50.756
I need you to believe me.

23:54.961 --> 23:56.193
Could have gotten
yourself killed.

23:56.195 --> 23:57.163
Tell her that.

23:58.865 --> 24:00.800
- Who?
- Her.

24:02.735 --> 24:03.769
Psycho.

24:11.144 --> 24:12.845
I would have moved, I just...

24:14.113 --> 24:15.215
I was proving a point.

24:17.917 --> 24:18.951
He couldn't see you.

24:20.053 --> 24:20.921
No.

24:24.790 --> 24:26.792
And Brandon, my manager,
he couldn't see you.

24:33.065 --> 24:35.801
So I'm the only guy in this
whole city who can see you?

24:36.769 --> 24:40.007
My family lives right over the
bridge and they can't see me either.

24:42.808 --> 24:43.910
Unless...

24:45.711 --> 24:48.981
Let's assume for a second it's true... and I'm
not saying I buy it... but let's just assume

24:49.815 --> 24:52.084
I'm the only guy in the whole
world who can see you.

24:53.819 --> 24:55.222
What am I supposed
to do with that?

24:57.823 --> 24:59.825
I think we're supposed
to help each other.

25:04.063 --> 25:05.298
I'm Holly, by the way.

25:13.072 --> 25:14.141
Okay, how about this?

25:17.109 --> 25:20.681
That building on the corner
over there, apartment 510,

25:23.049 --> 25:23.849
that's me.

25:26.520 --> 25:29.822
If you're still invisible in the
morning, come by and we'll talk.

26:21.340 --> 26:23.976
- What time is it?
- Six.

26:24.577 --> 26:26.044
You said come by in the morning.

26:39.158 --> 26:40.192
What's up with you?

26:42.395 --> 26:44.261
She's usually more
of a guard dog.

26:44.263 --> 26:46.031
She can't see me, remember?

26:53.005 --> 26:53.839
Look...

26:55.941 --> 26:57.209
What do you want from me?

27:00.011 --> 27:04.015
I wasn't always like this. And

27:04.650 --> 27:06.818
you weren't always like...

27:07.620 --> 27:09.420
this.

27:09.422 --> 27:13.392
My point is maybe if
I can fix what I broke...

27:15.094 --> 27:18.431
then things will go back
to normal for both of us.

27:19.898 --> 27:21.032
How do you plan to do that?

27:23.235 --> 27:26.036
I'm sorry, this
is just so strange.

27:26.038 --> 27:26.737
Tell me about it.

27:26.739 --> 27:28.374
No, I-I mean the way that...

27:30.109 --> 27:33.244
You look at me
and not through me.

27:34.647 --> 27:36.214
I'm just not used to it.

27:41.387 --> 27:44.390
I gotta take her out.
Maude, let's go.

27:50.395 --> 27:51.930
How'd she lose her leg?

27:52.997 --> 27:56.034
That's how I found her.
Tied to a post.

27:57.436 --> 28:00.137
Someone gave up
on her same as me.

28:00.139 --> 28:01.374
Who gave up on you?

28:02.708 --> 28:04.143
What's that guy's problem?

28:05.277 --> 28:07.946
Oh he, uh, thinks
you're talking to yourself.

28:09.047 --> 28:11.015
Everybody in this city
talks to themselves.

28:12.050 --> 28:14.453
- So who gave up on you?
- What?

28:16.121 --> 28:19.023
- You said...
- Oh. Yeah.

28:24.162 --> 28:26.431
My mom's boyfriend kicked
me out when I was thirteen.

28:27.365 --> 28:29.999
Decided I was old enough
to fend for myself.

28:30.001 --> 28:31.102
Where did you go?

28:32.237 --> 28:34.273
Wherever. Around.

28:36.308 --> 28:40.045
- You slept on the street?
- In cars, mostly.

28:41.179 --> 28:42.046
I've done that.

28:48.019 --> 28:52.090
There was this junkyard nearby,
no place to shower though.

28:53.057 --> 28:55.528
Kids at school would make fun of me
so I started getting into fights.

28:57.530 --> 28:59.097
Eventually I dropped out.

29:01.132 --> 29:02.333
You kept fighting though.

29:05.203 --> 29:09.138
One day, I take on this guy.
Disrespected some girl at a bar.

29:09.140 --> 29:11.277
These kids at my old
school gather round.

29:12.177 --> 29:14.278
Me and him were going at it.

29:14.280 --> 29:15.247
He was a big dude too.

29:17.081 --> 29:20.518
All of a sudden they start
calling my name. Like

29:21.553 --> 29:24.322
cheering me on like I'm all of a
sudden important or whatever.

29:27.091 --> 29:28.159
That's when I'm like,

29:29.595 --> 29:32.231
if this is what it means to be a
fighter, I think I just found my calling.

29:33.798 --> 29:35.467
We gotta get you back out there.

29:36.568 --> 29:38.002
I still fight.

29:39.404 --> 29:40.271
Wait.

29:42.373 --> 29:44.040
You still fight?

29:44.042 --> 29:46.978
- Why didn't you say something?
- 'Cause you didn't ask.

29:48.547 --> 29:50.348
Well that makes
things a lot easier.

29:53.184 --> 29:56.052
I got a fight on Friday if you
want me to put you on the list.

29:56.054 --> 29:59.057
Oh that-no I-I
can't go into crowds.

30:00.492 --> 30:02.026
I wouldn't worry.

30:58.315 --> 31:00.083
- Hey!
- Whoo!

31:06.491 --> 31:09.893
Look at that, huh? Good as new.

31:09.895 --> 31:11.193
Hardly.

31:11.195 --> 31:13.596
Nice going, champ.
Should I tell them same time next month?

31:13.598 --> 31:15.197
I'll be there.

31:15.199 --> 31:17.468
My man.

31:18.335 --> 31:20.237
It's for you. You earned it.

31:22.340 --> 31:24.142
Is that three hundred dollars?

31:26.244 --> 31:29.178
You don't do it for the money,
you do it 'cause you love the sport.

31:29.180 --> 31:30.348
You call this a sport?

31:33.183 --> 31:34.484
It may not look like it to you

31:36.054 --> 31:39.889
but there's a lot of strategy in MMA.
It's a lot more than throwing punches.

31:39.891 --> 31:43.559
It seems like people
throwing punches.

31:43.561 --> 31:44.462
Oh...

31:45.663 --> 31:48.499
Okay look, say you got...

31:50.902 --> 31:56.906
Say you got a... a... a wrestler over here
and then a... a kick boxer over here. Okay?

31:56.908 --> 32:00.378
And... and... and they're both
very good at what they do.

32:01.179 --> 32:06.515
But they're different you know?
Like one's a hurricane and one's a tornado

32:06.517 --> 32:12.655
and... and so you get these two crazy
opposing forces of nature in the ring and...

32:12.657 --> 32:17.328
and... and... and it takes
everything they've got

32:18.563 --> 32:21.633
to beat the other one, you
know? Physical, mental...

32:24.267 --> 32:26.269
It's like a game of chess.

32:27.471 --> 32:28.572
It's like chess.

32:29.674 --> 32:32.610
Still, I mean three hundred
dollars is just wrong.

32:35.279 --> 32:39.283
The other guy gets half,
so... go talk to him.

32:41.418 --> 32:43.420
We need to get
you better venues.

32:45.422 --> 32:47.157
And bigger fights.

32:49.761 --> 32:52.630
- You think so?
- Yes.

32:56.634 --> 32:58.669
How you gonna match
me up with better fighters?

32:59.536 --> 33:03.571
'Cause let's be real, nobody
who's anybody is gonna fight me.

33:04.709 --> 33:05.575
Why not?

33:09.747 --> 33:11.315
'Cause I don't sell
tickets anymore.

33:11.983 --> 33:13.351
Just get me a list.

33:39.010 --> 33:40.343
Yeah, right.

33:56.060 --> 34:01.429
<i>So what a super moon is, is it's
the closest a full moon gets to the earth.</i>

34:01.431 --> 34:05.768
<i>You know the orbit of the moon is not a perfect
circle, it gets closer and farther away.</i>

34:05.770 --> 34:08.770
<i>So from Sunday night
going to Monday night</i>

34:08.772 --> 34:12.574
<i>we'll have the closest full moon
of the year. Now this one is a...</i>

34:12.576 --> 34:17.079
<i>The moon hasn't been this close
to the earth since January 1948.</i>

34:17.081 --> 34:20.482
<i>So it's been a long time
since it was this close.</i>

34:20.484 --> 34:21.650
<i>Can
you give us the details</i>

34:21.652 --> 34:24.052
<i>of how much larger and
how much brighter it might get?</i>

34:33.396 --> 34:38.502
Someone who wants
to make a deal.

35:13.537 --> 35:14.604
It's open.

35:17.674 --> 35:19.641
So, I have some news.

35:19.643 --> 35:21.009
Oh wait, wait, two seconds.

35:21.011 --> 35:23.745
Finish line's right here.
Which one of these guys is gonna win?

35:23.747 --> 35:26.447
Oh. The... the top one.

35:26.449 --> 35:29.751
- You sure about that?
- Definitely. Look there they go.

35:29.753 --> 35:30.585
- Okay.
- Come on.

35:30.587 --> 35:31.754
- Go! Go!
- Come on.

35:31.756 --> 35:33.888
- Yes!
- Aw. How did that happen?

35:33.890 --> 35:37.594
Let me tell you, this
is not my first rodeo.

35:39.129 --> 35:44.868
I mean... I just mean, um I've spent
a lot of time staring out of windows.

35:47.504 --> 35:49.873
When you said it wasn't
always like this for you

35:51.875 --> 35:52.843
what did you mean?

35:55.745 --> 35:58.348
It started when my mom died.

35:59.816 --> 36:04.721
She was kind of the only one who got me.
So when she was gone, I just kind of...

36:08.758 --> 36:09.893
I was twelve.

36:14.531 --> 36:15.632
I'm sorry.

36:21.504 --> 36:24.640
Oh you should... you
should probably take that.

36:31.548 --> 36:33.615
- <i>Hey champ!</i>
- Hey Brandon, what's up?

36:33.617 --> 36:35.317
<i>Get ready for this.</i>

36:35.319 --> 36:38.853
<i>Pulled some strings. You're gonna be
fighting The Clever Suarez in six weeks.</i>

36:38.855 --> 36:40.624
- You're kidding.
- He's not.

36:45.762 --> 36:47.831
Yeah what - uh... I will.

36:50.767 --> 36:51.668
Okay.

36:52.736 --> 36:54.235
Alright. Bye.

36:54.237 --> 36:58.206
Let me guess. You're fighting
Carlos The Cleaver Suarez.

36:58.208 --> 37:01.808
- How did you pull that off?
- You let me worry about setting up the fights.

37:01.810 --> 37:03.479
You worry about the training.

37:05.882 --> 37:07.215
You're awesome.

37:07.217 --> 37:09.017
You better get to work.

37:10.820 --> 37:13.221
Alright, yeah.

37:13.223 --> 37:16.625
Drop and give me
twenty! I'm kidding.

37:29.739 --> 37:32.706
Shayne Blackwell. Now there's a
name we haven't heard in a while.

37:32.708 --> 37:35.809
This match up with Carlos
Suarez came out of nowhere.

37:35.811 --> 37:38.046
I give the guy credit
for giving it a shot

37:38.048 --> 37:39.680
but we're talking about
a five year lay-off here.

37:39.682 --> 37:44.955
Suarez is a great competitor. He's the
real deal. He has a great ground game.

37:45.855 --> 37:49.756
What I want to know is, how do you make up
for all this lost time in just six weeks?

37:49.758 --> 37:53.860
Hey look, Shayne Blackwell was a good fighter.
Maybe a great fighter back in his day.

37:53.862 --> 37:57.265
Blackwell is way out of
his league if you ask me.

37:57.267 --> 38:00.001
Suarez is gonna put him
away in the first round.

38:00.003 --> 38:02.003
Call in guys, let me
know what you think.

38:02.005 --> 38:05.642
My prediction? He's
gonna get killed out there.

38:21.658 --> 38:22.726
What's with the pictures?

38:23.759 --> 38:24.760
For publicity.

38:27.297 --> 38:28.664
I'm fixing your image.

38:40.043 --> 38:41.076
Who's Troy?

38:41.844 --> 38:42.845
My brother.

38:44.013 --> 38:45.846
I didn't know you had a brother.

38:45.848 --> 38:47.616
I have an older sister too.

38:48.817 --> 38:50.318
What's your family like?

38:50.320 --> 38:51.854
Well let's see. My uh,

38:53.223 --> 38:56.791
my brother is a pervert who spends
his days ogling women's legs.

38:56.793 --> 38:57.860
Seriously.

38:59.361 --> 39:02.698
And my sister's interest in the world
consists of what's on her plate.

39:04.099 --> 39:08.602
Her latest diet is sesame
crackers and water.

39:08.604 --> 39:10.871
She says everything else
makes her nauseous.

39:10.873 --> 39:12.040
Maybe she's pregnant.

39:12.042 --> 39:15.077
Yeah right, she could never
stand to gain the weight.

39:22.084 --> 39:24.686
Wait, so your family
never talks about you?

39:25.888 --> 39:26.722
No.

39:27.756 --> 39:29.025
It's like I never existed.

39:32.693 --> 39:33.662
That's insane.

39:40.135 --> 39:41.904
I wish I could be at the fight.

39:43.406 --> 39:44.573
You're not coming?

39:46.142 --> 39:47.911
I don't do crowds that size.

39:48.710 --> 39:51.847
- Why?
- The last time I did I got this.

39:52.714 --> 39:53.682
Oh my God.

39:55.117 --> 39:57.052
I had to give myself stitches.

39:58.987 --> 40:01.590
So I will be watching
you but from home.

40:04.194 --> 40:05.929
Why don't you come
watch the fight at my place?

40:08.864 --> 40:09.731
Okay.

40:10.399 --> 40:11.266
Alright.

40:24.079 --> 40:26.012
Come on, baby!
We gonna be late.

40:26.014 --> 40:29.751
Hi Marjus. Hey Ness...
Mind if I borrow some clothes?

40:30.719 --> 40:33.753
Does this look too tight
on me? It feels too tight.

40:33.755 --> 40:35.157
- You look perfect.
- Perfect.

40:36.792 --> 40:38.093
I promise
I'll bring them back.

41:10.225 --> 41:13.059
<i>Well Blackwell came into
tonight's match as the underdog.</i>

41:13.061 --> 41:17.197
<i>You can see him trying to find his rhythm
against an opponent in his prime like Suarez.</i>

41:17.199 --> 41:20.135
<i>But we have seen him win
a lot of belts in the past.</i>

41:32.213 --> 41:35.184
Keep doing what you're
doing, champ! You got him!

41:48.531 --> 41:51.199
<i>Blackwell tries to gain
some distance from Suarez.</i>

42:10.519 --> 42:11.752
Yeah!

42:23.131 --> 42:25.532
<i>Blackwell looks a bit
stunned but he shakes it off.</i>

42:25.534 --> 42:27.336
<i>Suarez now looking
for a takedown.</i>

42:37.045 --> 42:38.747
You got
him, you got him!

42:43.150 --> 42:44.352
He's in a tight bout!

42:45.587 --> 42:47.119
Yeah!

42:47.121 --> 42:48.854
- <i>And it's all over!</i>
- Yes!

42:48.856 --> 42:51.824
<i>Blackwell wins by submission
in the third round!</i>

42:51.826 --> 42:53.293
- <i>Unbelievable.</i>
- Yes!

42:53.295 --> 42:54.762
<i>What an upset!</i>

42:57.132 --> 43:00.968
Yeah! He tapped out! Whoo!

43:04.171 --> 43:08.575
<i>And the winner
is Shayne Blackwell!</i>

43:08.577 --> 43:10.212
You're the champ. Number one!

43:16.117 --> 43:19.954
What'd I tell you, huh?
Stick with me, kid.

43:21.122 --> 43:22.888
You the man!

43:22.890 --> 43:27.127
By the way, that purse is not quite what they
said. Something about taxes what have you.

43:27.129 --> 43:30.165
But for the next fight, you're gonna
be making triple what you made now.

43:30.932 --> 43:36.037
Yeah! Champ right here!
Champ right here!

43:49.950 --> 43:51.417
Thanks, bud.

43:51.419 --> 43:55.421
Shayne? Dan Wolfe, Gotham News.
Congratulations on your big win tonight!

43:55.423 --> 43:56.922
Thanks, man.

43:56.924 --> 43:59.326
You went in as the underdog in a lot
of people's minds. What happened?

43:59.328 --> 44:03.363
I mean, Suarez is a great fighter.
He made a mistake and I capitalized on it.

44:03.365 --> 44:06.432
Yeah. Rumor has it you're gonna
be fighting Tommy Bones next.

44:06.434 --> 44:07.933
Yep.

44:07.935 --> 44:10.237
Uh, any reason you're not out tonight
celebrating? Did you get injured?

44:11.038 --> 44:14.208
I feel great. And I do
plan to celebrate.

44:27.154 --> 44:28.856
- Hey Maude.
- You did it.

44:29.657 --> 44:30.591
Felt pretty good.

44:32.126 --> 44:35.963
- Oh my God, your eye!
- Looks worse than it is.

44:41.302 --> 44:42.403
You take that.

44:44.171 --> 44:44.939
Come on.

44:46.207 --> 44:48.042
I want to show
you ladies something.

44:56.451 --> 45:00.019
There you go. Hey,
stick that thing in the door, will you?

45:03.157 --> 45:04.258
There you go.

45:06.293 --> 45:08.362
- Not bad, huh?
- Wow.

45:14.336 --> 45:16.404
Here you go, I got this for you.

45:19.073 --> 45:20.706
And this is for me.

45:20.708 --> 45:23.377
- What kind is it?
- Peanut butter ice cream.

45:24.445 --> 45:26.313
The best thing ever
after a fight.

45:36.757 --> 45:38.492
I couldn't have
done it without you.

45:42.463 --> 45:46.066
You looked great out
there. You really did.

45:47.134 --> 45:48.202
Thanks.

45:52.138 --> 45:53.507
You look good, by the way.

45:56.076 --> 45:57.144
Thank you.

46:09.490 --> 46:11.358
Can I ask you something?

46:12.226 --> 46:13.260
Yeah.

46:15.229 --> 46:17.164
Are you sure you're real?

46:17.765 --> 46:19.333
What is that supposed to mean?

46:20.769 --> 46:21.969
You know.

46:25.338 --> 46:28.174
Maybe I took a few too many
hits to the head over the years.

46:30.511 --> 46:33.245
You know just because people can't
see me doesn't mean I don't exist.

46:33.247 --> 46:35.781
Alright, see? I knew you
were gonna get mad.

46:35.783 --> 46:38.419
- You're writing me off.
- I'm not writing you off. I'm just...

46:41.187 --> 46:42.355
trying to understand.

46:48.395 --> 46:49.330
Hey.

46:52.266 --> 46:53.567
I want you to be real.

46:57.137 --> 46:58.338
Prove it.

47:23.564 --> 47:26.300
Hey! Come back with that camera.

47:28.435 --> 47:29.503
No, no, no!

47:33.172 --> 47:35.273
Well hey, jokes on him.

47:35.275 --> 47:37.243
It's gonna look like
you're alone in that picture.

47:44.318 --> 47:46.453
Hope you like sleeping
under the stars.

48:08.341 --> 48:09.442
Come here.

48:22.623 --> 48:25.224
Your heart is
beating really fast.

48:52.418 --> 48:54.320
Okay, whoa!

48:57.189 --> 48:58.324
Is this okay?

49:01.294 --> 49:03.129
No, it's... it's good... it's...

49:04.597 --> 49:07.701
It's really good. It's just new.

49:19.345 --> 49:20.680
We can take our time.

49:24.584 --> 49:25.551
Okay.

50:48.401 --> 50:49.569
What?

50:52.038 --> 50:54.240
I don't know what to do next.

51:03.049 --> 51:04.717
I got some ideas.

51:50.862 --> 51:52.531
I'm in the photo.

51:57.603 --> 52:00.439
I'm in the photo! Yes!

52:01.908 --> 52:03.409
Thank you!

52:08.580 --> 52:10.680
Tommy, as a two-time
platinum belt winner,

52:10.682 --> 52:12.482
what's your prediction
going into the fight?

52:12.484 --> 52:14.752
- How many times did I win that belt?
- Two times.

52:14.754 --> 52:17.621
Man, this joker been out
of the game for five years.

52:17.623 --> 52:20.724
I bet you right here, I get that
submission in the first round.

52:20.726 --> 52:22.493
Shayne, what
do you say to that?

52:22.495 --> 52:24.596
I've been working hard and
I know what I'm capable of.

52:25.530 --> 52:28.132
All that matters is what
happens in the cage.

52:28.134 --> 52:31.568
Only thing that'll happen in that cage
is I'm gonna beat your ass like a drum.

52:31.570 --> 52:33.906
Shayne, is it true you
fired your manager?

52:35.440 --> 52:36.372
Yeah, we parted ways.

52:36.374 --> 52:38.609
You sure it wasn't
the other way around?

52:38.611 --> 52:39.742
I'm gonna give you
a little preview

52:39.744 --> 52:41.613
of what it's like when I
mop the floor with his face.

52:42.914 --> 52:45.617
I'm gonna make it look like
Matae took it easy on you, baby.

52:46.618 --> 52:48.585
Why don't you walk over here,
I'll knock you out right now.

52:48.587 --> 52:49.887
Gentlemen, gentlemen, please.

52:49.889 --> 52:51.487
The fear
in his eyes, man.

52:51.489 --> 52:53.591
Alright, we have time
for one more question.

52:53.593 --> 52:57.727
Shayne! Is Julianna
King Shadow Girl?

52:57.729 --> 52:59.429
What?

52:59.431 --> 53:01.865
There are rumors going around that you and
Julianna King are getting back together.

53:01.867 --> 53:03.435
Is she the woman
in this picture?

53:07.606 --> 53:08.839
No comment.

53:11.577 --> 53:13.777
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Tommy, Tommy!

53:13.779 --> 53:15.881
Oh, my people. Here you go!

53:17.449 --> 53:21.920
Don't' forget: you look good, you feel
good. You feel good, you fight good.

53:26.792 --> 53:28.560
You look good, you fight good.

53:30.763 --> 53:31.895
Yeah, we waiting on someone.

53:31.897 --> 53:36.401
Well Tommy, I'll get right
down to business, shall I?

53:44.476 --> 53:45.011
Ha!

53:48.512 --> 53:49.979
Yeah, right.

53:49.981 --> 53:51.416
Hm.

53:59.758 --> 54:00.825
Oh shit!

54:03.561 --> 54:04.697
Yep.

54:16.741 --> 54:17.676
Get the f...

54:19.045 --> 54:20.578
Yeah, alright.

54:27.619 --> 54:30.722
Yes or no?

54:32.691 --> 54:33.992
This is some bullshit.

54:36.895 --> 54:38.630
Playing games with Bones.

54:42.267 --> 54:43.633
- Okay Kevin.
- Yep.

54:43.635 --> 54:44.869
See you next week.

54:45.670 --> 54:46.771
Hi.

54:47.739 --> 54:48.740
Hi.

54:50.842 --> 54:54.744
When are you gonna quit? You
don't have to work here anymore.

54:54.746 --> 54:55.880
It keeps me humble.

54:57.816 --> 55:01.720
Why did you let them
think it was Julianna?

55:02.988 --> 55:04.087
What are you talking about?

55:04.089 --> 55:06.992
At the press conference
when they asked you about...

55:07.792 --> 55:10.762
- Shadow Girl?
- I thought you didn't show up in pictures.

55:11.629 --> 55:13.897
I don't... usually.

55:19.070 --> 55:20.638
So you're coming back?

55:24.042 --> 55:25.043
You're coming back!

55:36.821 --> 55:41.559
You... you made me
feel like... like I matter.

55:43.795 --> 55:45.063
Of course you matter.

55:57.742 --> 55:58.674
Hello?

55:58.676 --> 55:59.544
<i>Hi.</i>

56:00.678 --> 56:01.546
Julianna?

56:03.815 --> 56:05.081
Hold on just a second.

56:05.083 --> 56:09.085
<i>I heard we might be getting
back together. I'm just kidding.</i>

56:09.087 --> 56:12.989
<i>Congratulations on the Suarez fight.
That was pretty impressive.</i>

56:12.991 --> 56:13.992
Thanks.

56:15.226 --> 56:18.797
<i>Well uh, I will be rooting
for you during the next one.</i>

56:20.965 --> 56:22.365
You in town?

56:22.367 --> 56:25.569
<i>For a few weeks, my new
movie's coming out so...</i>

56:26.670 --> 56:28.672
<i>Anyway um, I just wanted
to wish you luck.</i>

56:30.108 --> 56:31.109
Appreciate it.

56:36.781 --> 56:38.415
Wasn't expecting her to call.

56:38.417 --> 56:40.084
Well, you are a winner again.

56:40.918 --> 56:43.587
- She sounded happy for me.
- She's an actress.

56:45.123 --> 56:47.656
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean it like that.

56:47.658 --> 56:48.858
No, I know what you meant.

56:48.860 --> 56:50.995
Hey I'm just
looking out for you.

56:52.030 --> 56:53.631
Is that what you're doing?

56:55.967 --> 56:58.033
<i>And now for the moment
you've all been waiting for.</i>

56:58.035 --> 56:59.835
<i>The main event of the evening.</i>

56:59.837 --> 57:05.108
<i>Fighting out of the red corner with an
undefeated record of ten wins and no loses,</i>

57:05.110 --> 57:07.944
<i>Tommy the Destroyer Bones.</i>

57:07.946 --> 57:11.447
<i>And challenging him for the first
time, the former world champion</i>

57:11.449 --> 57:16.218
<i>fighting out of the blue
corner, Shayne Blackwell!</i>

57:19.524 --> 57:23.027
Obey my commands at all times, protect
yourselves at all times. Touch gloves.

57:23.894 --> 57:25.629
This don't make you a winner.

57:26.831 --> 57:29.634
Ready? Ready? Fight!

57:31.034 --> 57:35.839
I've got a behind the scenes
exclusive Blackwell training.

57:41.446 --> 57:43.948
Does it include
naked shower photos?

57:45.183 --> 57:46.918
No shower photos.

57:53.957 --> 58:00.764
Well doll face, good people
and hard work don't sell papers.

58:05.836 --> 58:08.172
How about this for an exclusive?

58:09.806 --> 58:10.941
Matae

58:12.042 --> 58:15.180
agrees to rematch
with Blackwell.

58:21.920 --> 58:22.986
When did that happen?

58:30.495 --> 58:31.826
<i>Ron! You got
something good for me?</i>

58:31.828 --> 58:35.099
You know anything about a rematch
between Blackwell and Matae?

58:38.169 --> 58:41.939
One of my sources.
I can't remember her name, but she's good.

58:44.107 --> 58:46.174
Giving you this.

58:46.176 --> 58:48.843
Either you run with it or

58:48.845 --> 58:52.250
someone else will.

58:53.117 --> 58:55.019
It's gonna be
the fight of the year.

58:58.155 --> 58:59.323
Decade.

59:03.327 --> 59:06.928
Hell, if we print it it's
halfway to being true anyway.

59:06.930 --> 59:10.299
Kick the embezzlement scandal off page one.
They're dime a dozen.

59:10.301 --> 59:12.901
- <i>You're telling me...</i>
- People love a good comeback story.

59:12.903 --> 59:14.171
<i>You bet you're a...</i>

59:22.946 --> 59:24.047
Attila!

59:24.881 --> 59:25.882
What's up, bud?

59:27.352 --> 59:29.886
- Can I get your autograph?
- Yeah of course, man

59:33.823 --> 59:36.091
Dude, I'm totally pumped
about the rematch.

59:36.093 --> 59:37.559
- Rematch?
- Yeah.

59:37.561 --> 59:42.297
- What rematch?
- Shayne Blackwell. That's pretty cool man.

59:42.299 --> 59:43.331
Alright, man.

59:43.333 --> 59:44.167
Thanks.

59:50.040 --> 59:52.209
What's this bullshit about
a Blackwell rematch?

59:54.011 --> 59:55.879
How is this the first
you've heard of it?

59:57.080 --> 59:58.315
Well, it's not happening.

01:00:00.117 --> 01:00:01.818
'Cause I've already beat him.

01:00:04.355 --> 01:00:08.225
That's ridiculous. You know what? I've
beat him before and I can beat him again.

01:00:12.362 --> 01:00:16.099
Fine. Just get it done so I can
focus on the championship.

01:00:18.268 --> 01:00:19.803
Nice place.

01:01:01.177 --> 01:01:03.979
Come on, we've all got secrets.

01:01:19.995 --> 01:01:21.198
Carrots.

01:01:27.671 --> 01:01:28.872
You still up?

01:01:31.407 --> 01:01:33.008
I'm just checking on you.

01:01:33.677 --> 01:01:37.179
Please, be a prostitute
or a dealer.

01:01:37.947 --> 01:01:39.949
Yeah? What are you wearing?

01:01:42.419 --> 01:01:45.188
Come on Ma,
they're just slippers.

01:01:46.223 --> 01:01:47.990
Your other ones were worn out.

01:01:49.693 --> 01:01:52.194
Aw, I'm glad you think
they're comfortable.

01:01:53.463 --> 01:01:56.366
Alright, you have a great
night, Ma. I love you too.

01:02:09.178 --> 01:02:10.212
Vanessa?

01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:19.922
Oh my God, you are pregnant.

01:02:21.725 --> 01:02:23.125
Does Marjus know?

01:02:38.141 --> 01:02:40.309
What's the matter? Why
aren't you happy about it?

01:02:53.457 --> 01:02:55.358
<i>Hey, this is Shayne.
Leave a message.</i>

01:02:57.059 --> 01:03:03.330
Hey, so you were right, Vanessa's pregnant
but she's not telling her husband about it.

01:03:03.332 --> 01:03:05.434
I hope she's not
having an affair.

01:03:07.136 --> 01:03:08.103
Call me back.

01:03:29.158 --> 01:03:30.092
Thank you.

01:03:33.095 --> 01:03:34.163
To old times.

01:03:37.233 --> 01:03:41.003
Come on, they weren't all bad.
Some things were great.

01:03:42.539 --> 01:03:43.607
They were.

01:03:48.410 --> 01:03:50.546
How's Maude? I miss her.

01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:52.548
She's doing good.

01:03:56.418 --> 01:04:00.189
So you still with that uh,
big hot shot director?

01:04:03.426 --> 01:04:05.494
No, he was a producer.

01:04:06.562 --> 01:04:09.164
And no, that was
a long time ago.

01:04:10.132 --> 01:04:11.865
So who's the lucky guy?

01:04:11.867 --> 01:04:13.369
Who says there's only one?

01:04:16.272 --> 01:04:18.107
I'm just kidding,
there's no one.

01:04:22.310 --> 01:04:24.611
- What about you?
- What about me?

01:04:24.613 --> 01:04:27.316
Who's the girl in that picture
with you? Who's Shadow Girl?

01:04:29.184 --> 01:04:30.452
Nobody you'd know.

01:04:33.489 --> 01:04:37.192
Okay, well, if you're trying to
make me jealous it's working.

01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:47.236
Julianna, I don't know
what this is but

01:04:50.205 --> 01:04:52.174
I don't have time for games.

01:04:53.142 --> 01:04:54.310
I'm not playing.

01:05:02.351 --> 01:05:04.420
That didn't take you very long.

01:05:05.621 --> 01:05:07.354
- What are you doing here?
- What?

01:05:07.356 --> 01:05:08.890
What are you doing here?

01:05:08.892 --> 01:05:10.925
- Are you spying on me?
- Who are you talking to?

01:05:10.927 --> 01:05:11.695
What?

01:05:13.696 --> 01:05:14.928
Shayne, what's going on?

01:05:14.930 --> 01:05:19.100
I came for her, I didn't think
you were gonna be her date.

01:05:24.239 --> 01:05:25.674
Holly! Wait up!

01:05:27.543 --> 01:05:28.377
Holly!

01:05:29.511 --> 01:05:30.478
Stop, stop!

01:05:33.515 --> 01:05:36.418
So what was that the other night?
That meant nothing to you?

01:05:37.353 --> 01:05:38.320
Of course it did.

01:05:39.355 --> 01:05:41.657
So... so then what were
you doing with Julianna?

01:05:42.458 --> 01:05:47.196
She called and asked
if we could meet. I...

01:05:49.197 --> 01:05:50.563
I wanted to see
what would happen.

01:05:50.565 --> 01:05:52.534
I have a pretty good idea.

01:05:53.602 --> 01:05:57.171
You don't get it. We've been
through a lot, me and her.

01:05:58.540 --> 01:06:00.709
She doesn't care about you.

01:06:01.577 --> 01:06:03.412
- She's just...
- Holly...

01:06:04.279 --> 01:06:05.613
- ...using you.
- Holly...

01:06:11.252 --> 01:06:12.421
I think you're great.

01:06:14.222 --> 01:06:16.291
I wouldn't be where
I am without you.

01:06:17.426 --> 01:06:18.160
But...

01:06:20.462 --> 01:06:21.697
out in the real world...

01:06:22.497 --> 01:06:23.665
you don't exist.

01:06:26.267 --> 01:06:28.169
People seeing us...

01:06:29.404 --> 01:06:31.571
People seeing us right now
think I'm talking to myself

01:06:31.573 --> 01:06:33.442
like I'm some kind
of crazy person.

01:06:35.444 --> 01:06:37.513
I just wanted to be
straight with you, alright?

01:06:39.714 --> 01:06:41.716
You deserve a medal.

01:06:46.588 --> 01:06:51.391
And don't pretend that you didn't...
You want something else out of this.

01:06:51.393 --> 01:06:54.363
You wanted to help me
as a way to help yourself.

01:07:01.003 --> 01:07:03.304
Well, that may be
all I can deliver.

01:07:05.273 --> 01:07:05.941
What?

01:07:06.742 --> 01:07:09.445
I couldn't find
anything on Matae.

01:07:10.012 --> 01:07:13.648
- So?
- So? I can't guarantee you're gonna win the fight.

01:07:14.782 --> 01:07:16.584
Yeah, of course you
can. What are you...

01:07:25.627 --> 01:07:28.028
You've been fixing these fights.

01:07:28.030 --> 01:07:31.766
You wanted me to wave
a magic wand so I did.

01:07:33.334 --> 01:07:36.637
- So you make me a fraud?
- You didn't question the result!

01:07:43.311 --> 01:07:44.646
Is that what you think of me?

01:07:46.515 --> 01:07:48.316
Is that what you think I wanted?

01:07:55.490 --> 01:07:57.323
Get out of my sight.

01:07:57.325 --> 01:07:57.860
Shayne...

01:08:01.764 --> 01:08:05.399
Keep looking for the worst in people,
I guarantee you're gonna find it.

01:10:58.239 --> 01:10:59.773
What are you doing here?

01:11:00.975 --> 01:11:01.976
Can I come in?

01:11:05.980 --> 01:11:07.715
I need to tell you something.

01:11:27.868 --> 01:11:28.869
Go ahead.

01:11:36.944 --> 01:11:39.479
The picture you took
of me and that girl

01:11:41.082 --> 01:11:43.617
wasn't the reason
Julianna and I broke up.

01:11:45.987 --> 01:11:47.487
It wasn't the reason
I lost the fight.

01:11:50.090 --> 01:11:55.930
I think somewhere along the way I just
kind of started to buy into my own hype.

01:11:58.299 --> 01:11:59.900
I felt like the world
owed me something.

01:12:02.103 --> 01:12:03.804
Why try so hard, you know?

01:12:04.804 --> 01:12:07.941
I cut corners, I got lazy.

01:12:10.577 --> 01:12:11.511
I cheated.

01:12:14.949 --> 01:12:16.549
We both did, by the way.

01:12:18.886 --> 01:12:20.921
It wasn't the first
time I got caught.

01:12:23.656 --> 01:12:24.858
It was most public.

01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:28.128
And when it all fell apart...

01:12:31.831 --> 01:12:32.933
I couldn't handle it.

01:12:36.704 --> 01:12:39.939
So all this time...

01:12:42.008 --> 01:12:44.044
it wasn't my fault?

01:12:53.154 --> 01:12:55.688
Well, it makes sense
why it didn't work.

01:13:05.832 --> 01:13:09.636
Well, you got everything
you wanted, right?

01:13:21.948 --> 01:13:23.883
Tell me how I can
make it up to you.

01:13:39.032 --> 01:13:40.133
I can't.

01:13:41.668 --> 01:13:42.667
I can't.

01:13:42.669 --> 01:13:44.869
It's okay, nobody has to know.

01:13:44.871 --> 01:13:45.872
Look...

01:13:48.774 --> 01:13:51.142
I c... I care about
you, Holly, but...

01:13:51.144 --> 01:13:53.646
I don't want to be
that guy anymore.

01:13:58.751 --> 01:13:59.619
Look...

01:14:05.892 --> 01:14:07.093
Whatever you lost...

01:14:10.163 --> 01:14:11.064
You gotta...

01:14:12.899 --> 01:14:14.067
I gotta what?

01:14:16.903 --> 01:14:17.871
I don't know.

01:14:20.740 --> 01:14:23.076
Face whatever happened.

01:14:24.244 --> 01:14:26.012
I know what happened.

01:14:27.113 --> 01:14:30.817
My mom died and my
family abandoned me.

01:14:31.751 --> 01:14:33.050
Are you sure?

01:14:33.052 --> 01:14:34.787
Am I sure?

01:14:36.756 --> 01:14:38.057
- I just meant...
- Am I sure?

01:14:39.725 --> 01:14:42.028
I just think maybe there's
another way to look at it.

01:14:43.463 --> 01:14:45.697
You think that I want this?

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.836
Do you think that
this is a choice?

01:14:50.970 --> 01:14:55.474
Do you think that I woke up one day as a
twelve-year-old and decided it wasn't enough

01:14:55.476 --> 01:15:00.478
to have the one person I cared about most
die and watch everybody else move on,

01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:06.152
but what I would really, really love
is to have everybody start ignoring me?

01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:11.523
And slip into this weird
in-between world

01:15:11.525 --> 01:15:17.896
where I don't get acknowledged by another
living soul for how ever many years?

01:15:19.798 --> 01:15:21.899
You know that's not what I said.

01:15:21.901 --> 01:15:23.102
Just go.

01:15:46.326 --> 01:15:47.859
I hope you'll be there.

01:15:50.095 --> 01:15:51.264
It would mean a lot.

01:15:52.532 --> 01:15:54.900
I don't do crowds, remember?

01:18:53.078 --> 01:18:53.912
Hey!

01:18:55.714 --> 01:18:56.448
Shayne!

01:19:14.165 --> 01:19:15.065
Shayne!

01:20:00.512 --> 01:20:02.447
So where are you, huh?

01:20:06.485 --> 01:20:08.986
What happened to me
never being alone?

01:20:10.154 --> 01:20:13.358
Huh? What happened to you
coming whenever I needed you?

01:20:16.294 --> 01:20:19.064
Well, I need you now!

01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:22.533
Please!

01:20:24.536 --> 01:20:26.203
I don't know what to do.

01:20:30.542 --> 01:20:34.145
I don't... I don't
have anywhere to go.

01:20:37.315 --> 01:20:39.316
Can someone tell me what to do?

01:20:44.422 --> 01:20:46.591
Can someone tell me what to do?

01:21:01.405 --> 01:21:06.211
Okay, I have this photo shoot and then
I'll be back. How are you feeling?

01:21:06.845 --> 01:21:09.112
Ready to get in
there and dominate.

01:21:09.114 --> 01:21:09.648
Great.

01:21:11.283 --> 01:21:12.449
'Cause I don't date losers.

01:21:14.518 --> 01:21:17.187
Babe, I'm joking.

01:21:19.323 --> 01:21:20.559
Let me ask you something.

01:21:21.693 --> 01:21:24.227
Would you have called
me if I hadn't fought Suarez?

01:21:24.229 --> 01:21:25.497
Yes, of course.

01:21:26.598 --> 01:21:28.567
Would you have called
me if I hadn't won?

01:21:31.135 --> 01:21:33.203
Eventually, yes.

01:21:34.873 --> 01:21:38.443
Look, I'm not going to apologize to
you for wanting you to be successful.

01:21:41.613 --> 01:21:43.113
Makes sense.

01:21:47.518 --> 01:21:48.619
Come on girls,
let's take a picture.

01:21:50.487 --> 01:21:52.356
Dad, why do we
always have to do this?

01:21:53.490 --> 01:21:56.693
- Alright, smile!
- You'll thank me one day.

01:21:58.295 --> 01:21:59.664
Okay, it's good!

01:22:01.900 --> 01:22:04.101
See it wasn't too bad. Let's go.

01:22:13.912 --> 01:22:15.145
Just a sec.

01:22:26.590 --> 01:22:29.126
I wanted to come
say good-bye to you.

01:22:31.562 --> 01:22:34.466
I'm not really sure how much
longer I'm gonna be here.

01:22:36.935 --> 01:22:40.571
That's your third one, Vanessa.
I think it's pretty clear.

01:22:41.538 --> 01:22:44.408
- Everything okay, baby?
- Just a sec.

01:22:48.479 --> 01:22:50.649
You have to tell him, Ness.

01:22:59.356 --> 01:23:00.222
Just broke a nail.

01:23:00.224 --> 01:23:02.557
No, she didn't!
Look, they're perfect.

01:23:02.559 --> 01:23:05.429
- You sure you're okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:23:06.296 --> 01:23:08.265
I'm not leaving you like this.

01:23:21.712 --> 01:23:23.447
We make the baby?

01:23:26.450 --> 01:23:28.185
I didn't know how to tell you.

01:23:30.319 --> 01:23:33.457
She's gonna be beautiful
like her mommy.

01:23:38.595 --> 01:23:39.730
I can't...

01:23:40.731 --> 01:23:41.831
I can't.

01:23:41.833 --> 01:23:44.636
- Did I say something wrong?
- No, no, no, no, no...

01:23:47.004 --> 01:23:50.808
Growing up I... I... I never felt
like I was good enough,

01:23:52.576 --> 01:23:56.647
or smart enough or
interesting enough.

01:23:59.483 --> 01:24:02.619
My mother always
played favorites, and it...

01:24:04.021 --> 01:24:05.522
it definitely wasn't me.

01:24:07.024 --> 01:24:09.593
I felt so cheated when she died.

01:24:12.596 --> 01:24:18.801
All I could count on was that I looked nice
and I don't want to put that on our kid.

01:24:18.803 --> 01:24:22.639
I... Whether she's
pretty or not, I... I don't...

01:24:23.540 --> 01:24:26.844
I don't ever want her
to feel that's all she is.

01:24:28.679 --> 01:24:29.546
She won't.

01:24:37.588 --> 01:24:38.621
She won't.

01:24:43.392 --> 01:24:44.795
Same goes if it's a boy.

01:25:52.461 --> 01:25:54.597
Your film is really beautiful.

01:26:08.477 --> 01:26:11.480
I guess I wasn't really
the best big sister, huh?

01:26:27.530 --> 01:26:29.465
You need to get out more.

01:26:40.476 --> 01:26:41.675
Oh!

01:26:41.677 --> 01:26:43.713
- I'm sorry.
- Ow.

01:26:52.556 --> 01:26:55.656
- Are... are you okay, Miss?
- I... I think so... I...

01:26:55.658 --> 01:26:58.759
Yeah you shouldn't stand. Uh.

01:26:58.761 --> 01:27:00.527
Here uh, do you need a hand?

01:27:00.529 --> 01:27:02.730
- I'm gonna put your arms...
- Come on, Troy.

01:27:02.732 --> 01:27:05.802
- Don't put... don't put too much weight on it.
- Uh. Okay.

01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:11.875
- Do you need some ice?
- No.

01:27:16.679 --> 01:27:18.848
- I'm Allison
- Oh, I'm Troy.

01:27:19.982 --> 01:27:23.686
- You took quite a spill.
- Yeah. I don't know what happened.

01:27:25.222 --> 01:27:26.489
Yeah, I saw it.

01:27:27.590 --> 01:27:28.692
Then I thought I'd help.

01:27:35.965 --> 01:27:37.466
Why don't you date?

01:27:40.237 --> 01:27:42.670
I always thought it was because
you were too busy working

01:27:42.672 --> 01:27:46.642
but I've been wrong
about a few things lately.

01:27:48.778 --> 01:27:51.948
Why do you work so much?
It's not like this makes you happy.

01:28:06.595 --> 01:28:08.731
That's what you look like
when you're happy, Dad.

01:28:13.270 --> 01:28:15.004
Are all these to help you sleep?

01:28:46.969 --> 01:28:50.573
<i>And then it clicked.
Like the tumblers of a safe.</i>

01:28:54.011 --> 01:28:56.778
<i>Losing mom didn't
happen just to me.</i>

01:29:01.617 --> 01:29:03.052
<i>It happened to all of us.</i>

01:29:12.660 --> 01:29:13.963
You never got over her.

01:29:18.067 --> 01:29:18.934
Dad?

01:29:25.074 --> 01:29:26.075
Dad?

01:29:46.895 --> 01:29:47.829
Peter.

01:30:00.709 --> 01:30:02.711
Happy anniversary, Vicky.

01:30:06.815 --> 01:30:10.618
I know you prefer the
apricot-y orange but

01:30:11.854 --> 01:30:12.788
this one

01:30:14.957 --> 01:30:16.725
was the healthiest one they had.

01:30:24.732 --> 01:30:29.071
I never realized how hard it must have
been for you to go on without her.

01:30:32.408 --> 01:30:33.909
I'm sorry, Dad.

01:31:16.184 --> 01:31:19.121
<i>I had always expected
people to be there for me.</i>

01:31:20.456 --> 01:31:24.927
<i>But the truth was, I had never
really been there for anyone else.</i>

01:32:04.966 --> 01:32:06.234
Attila!

01:32:23.117 --> 01:32:24.252
Whoo!

01:32:36.864 --> 01:32:40.001
Come on. Would you
go a little bit faster?

01:33:01.222 --> 01:33:02.922
There we go.

01:33:02.924 --> 01:33:06.092
<i>Round two in this high round bout.
Matae with a clear advantage so far</i>

01:33:06.094 --> 01:33:07.960
<i>but it's still early
in the fight.</i>

01:33:07.962 --> 01:33:12.897
<i>Blackwell's strategy seems to be go straight on
the offence but Matae right now is untouchable.</i>

01:33:20.041 --> 01:33:24.243
<i>Goes up against the fence trying to keep him
from raining down strikes and that's round two.</i>

01:33:24.245 --> 01:33:25.911
Alright, come on we gotta hurry.

01:33:25.913 --> 01:33:28.149
Shayne!
You got this, baby!

01:33:29.117 --> 01:33:31.951
Attila! Knock him
out! Knock him out!

01:33:34.922 --> 01:33:37.390
<i>Matae tags Blackwell
with a left, then an upper cut.</i>

01:33:37.392 --> 01:33:39.892
<i>That one looks like it might
have done some damage.</i>

01:33:39.894 --> 01:33:43.998
<i>Blackwell taking some heavy blows in
this third round. He isn't backing down.</i>

01:33:45.932 --> 01:33:47.034
Come on man!

01:33:49.936 --> 01:33:51.072
Looking good, babe!

01:33:52.573 --> 01:33:54.640
- <i>Blackwell going for the take down and he gets it.</i>
- Don't slow down!

01:33:54.642 --> 01:33:56.142
You can make the light, go!

01:33:56.144 --> 01:33:59.245
<i>Matae gets Blackwell into a headlock
hoping to turn it into a sweep.</i>

01:33:59.247 --> 01:34:01.349
<i>But this is not a good
position for Matae.</i>

01:34:03.917 --> 01:34:07.919
Come on man!
Attila! Let's go! Let's go!

01:34:07.921 --> 01:34:11.392
Blackwell, you can
do this! Come on Blackwell!

01:34:15.897 --> 01:34:18.264
<i>Matae has clearly dominated
these first three rounds.</i>

01:34:18.266 --> 01:34:21.334
<i>Blackwell tried to reverse the
momentum, but it may not be enough.</i>

01:34:21.336 --> 01:34:23.170
<i>Blackwell showing
signs of fatigue.</i>

01:34:36.351 --> 01:34:38.051
Kick his ass!

01:34:39.252 --> 01:34:40.253
Kick him!

01:34:41.054 --> 01:34:43.124
Yeah! Let's go!

01:34:50.398 --> 01:34:53.165
Way to get him down! Let's go.

01:34:53.167 --> 01:34:54.401
Hey! Can you sign this?

01:35:07.081 --> 01:35:08.416
There! Whoo!

01:35:09.984 --> 01:35:14.687
Take it to him, Attila! Take it to him.
Take it to him! You got this, Attila!

01:35:14.689 --> 01:35:16.256
Make him tap, Attila!

01:35:20.060 --> 01:35:21.095
Go, Shayne!

01:35:25.166 --> 01:35:26.167
This is it!

01:35:35.142 --> 01:35:38.312
Yeah! Kick him! Let's go!

01:36:11.111 --> 01:36:14.045
That's it, that's it!
Attila! Knock him out!

01:36:14.047 --> 01:36:18.286
Finish him, finish him!
Yeah, Attila!

01:36:53.821 --> 01:36:55.322
Come on Shayne, stay in!

01:36:59.392 --> 01:37:00.327
Don't give up!

01:37:03.330 --> 01:37:04.532
Get up!

01:37:05.365 --> 01:37:06.366
Get up!

01:37:10.538 --> 01:37:12.136
Come on, get up.

01:37:12.138 --> 01:37:13.406
You got it, come on!

01:37:16.376 --> 01:37:19.513
Yes, yes. Yes.

01:37:31.825 --> 01:37:33.191
Yes.

01:37:33.193 --> 01:37:35.260
Hey, you're doing great.

01:37:35.262 --> 01:37:39.432
You deserve to be here 'cause you're a
fighter and even though you can't see me...

01:37:41.468 --> 01:37:44.372
I'm here for you,
no matter what.

01:37:51.645 --> 01:37:53.046
Holly?

01:37:55.883 --> 01:37:57.115
Hi.

01:37:57.117 --> 01:37:59.183
- You're here.
- Yeah.

01:37:59.185 --> 01:38:00.353
You're doing great.

01:38:01.455 --> 01:38:03.323
There's
a girl in the cage.

01:38:04.591 --> 01:38:06.591
Hey, where did she come from?

01:38:06.593 --> 01:38:08.326
Who's the girl in the cage?

01:38:08.328 --> 01:38:10.495
- How'd she get in?
- She part of Blackwell's crew?

01:38:10.497 --> 01:38:11.563
Who's that?

01:38:11.565 --> 01:38:12.865
- <i>Let me check on that.</i>
- Copy that.

01:38:12.867 --> 01:38:14.334
You got this.

01:38:15.235 --> 01:38:16.202
Okay?

01:38:17.905 --> 01:38:19.072
You ready?

01:38:21.273 --> 01:38:22.442
You got this.

01:38:23.343 --> 01:38:24.344
Ready?

01:38:25.679 --> 01:38:26.680
Ready?

01:38:28.448 --> 01:38:29.316
Fight!

01:38:44.898 --> 01:38:45.997
Yes.

01:38:45.999 --> 01:38:48.468
What should I do? People
are starting to complain.

01:38:54.239 --> 01:38:55.341
Get out of there!

01:38:55.909 --> 01:38:56.941
Yes!

01:38:56.943 --> 01:38:58.509
Come on, Shayne!

01:38:58.511 --> 01:39:00.212
Why won't she move?

01:39:09.456 --> 01:39:10.624
Whoo!

01:39:12.191 --> 01:39:13.256
Whoo!

01:39:13.258 --> 01:39:14.594
Looking good.

01:39:23.937 --> 01:39:25.372
Come on, Shayne!

01:39:30.977 --> 01:39:32.378
Yes!

01:39:35.949 --> 01:39:37.949
You! With the trench coat!

01:39:37.951 --> 01:39:39.984
<i>That girl is not
with Blackwell's crew.</i>

01:39:39.986 --> 01:39:41.421
Copy that. I'm on it.

01:39:42.656 --> 01:39:43.989
Come on, Shayne!

01:39:43.991 --> 01:39:45.423
- Hey.
- Yes!

01:39:45.425 --> 01:39:47.324
- Hey.
- Hit him!

01:39:47.326 --> 01:39:48.558
- Ma'am!
- Hit him back!

01:39:48.560 --> 01:39:50.597
Ma'am. This is
a restricted area.

01:39:51.564 --> 01:39:53.698
You can't be up there.

01:39:53.700 --> 01:39:55.466
- Come on.
- Come on, Shayne!

01:39:55.468 --> 01:39:56.768
- Yes, you got him!
- Ma'am, ma'am, let's go.

01:39:56.770 --> 01:39:59.404
- Just give me a minute!
- Let's go, it's time to go. Let's go.

01:39:59.406 --> 01:40:00.440
I'm coming.

01:40:05.244 --> 01:40:07.312
Come on Shayne! You got it!

01:40:09.582 --> 01:40:11.785
You can do it, babe! Come on!

01:40:36.710 --> 01:40:39.344
Shayne no matter what
anybody says, you did it!

01:40:40.612 --> 01:40:41.747
Yeah!

01:40:42.949 --> 01:40:45.449
<i>Ladies and
gentlemen, after five rounds</i>

01:40:45.451 --> 01:40:48.320
<i>we go to the judges'
score cards for a decision.</i>

01:40:52.592 --> 01:40:53.760
Can I have a selfie?

01:40:58.497 --> 01:41:01.766
<i>Harvey McIntire

01:41:33.398 --> 01:41:35.532
Hey Attila,
congratulations on your victory.

01:41:35.534 --> 01:41:36.769
Tell me how are you feeling?

01:41:39.072 --> 01:41:40.339
Hey, you.

01:41:41.541 --> 01:41:42.575
I'm sorry.

01:41:43.543 --> 01:41:44.711
But you did a good job.

01:41:47.813 --> 01:41:49.648
I gotta go find somebody.

01:41:51.383 --> 01:41:53.418
I know, I saw her.

01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:02.426
- Oh, hi.
- Hey.

01:42:02.428 --> 01:42:04.427
Uh, great job, great win.
Congratulations.

01:42:04.429 --> 01:42:06.563
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

01:42:06.565 --> 01:42:08.099
Pretty impressive.

01:42:08.101 --> 01:42:09.401
I um...

01:42:11.470 --> 01:42:13.639
I didn't realize
I needed a ticket

01:42:14.439 --> 01:42:15.440
- 'cause I...
- Hey!

01:42:16.575 --> 01:42:17.809
She's with me.

01:42:17.811 --> 01:42:20.409
She didn't have
a pass or anything.

01:42:20.411 --> 01:42:21.446
Alright.

01:42:25.417 --> 01:42:26.418
You...

01:42:27.853 --> 01:42:30.622
You were amazing out there.

01:42:31.456 --> 01:42:33.425
- Um...
- You came back.

01:42:34.426 --> 01:42:37.563
You were right
about so many things.

01:42:39.665 --> 01:42:40.866
Not everything.

01:42:49.741 --> 01:42:51.343
What about Julianna?

01:42:52.578 --> 01:42:54.412
We ended on good terms.

01:42:55.814 --> 01:42:58.349
So she's just here
to support you?

01:43:00.485 --> 01:43:01.753
In her own way.

01:43:21.506 --> 01:43:22.639
Oh, my God.

01:43:22.641 --> 01:43:24.641
I got a little blood
on you, I'm sorry.

01:43:24.643 --> 01:43:25.744
That's okay.

01:43:31.617 --> 01:43:33.719
<i>And so the
spell was broken.</i>

01:43:35.187 --> 01:43:37.789
<i>But love was only
half the journey.</i>

01:43:38.757 --> 01:43:44.730
<i>The rest was learning to recognize the
depth, and longing, and pain of others.</i>

01:43:45.931 --> 01:43:47.900
<i>In short, to grow up.</i>

01:44:34.980 --> 01:44:36.448
Holly.

01:44:38.582 --> 01:44:39.717
Hey, dad.

01:44:47.993 --> 01:44:48.994
Holly.
