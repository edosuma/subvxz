WEBVTT

00:01.867 --> 00:02.869
Oh, hey, Ben.

00:03.235 --> 00:07.742
Have you seen my complete collection
of all 193 National Flags?

00:07.807 --> 00:09.480
Oh, here they are.

00:10.110 --> 00:11.145
Wow!

00:11.211 --> 00:14.021
So, I've been asked to run
this year's Model U.N.

00:14.080 --> 00:15.991
at Pawnee Central High School.

00:16.049 --> 00:17.494
Attendance has been low,

00:17.550 --> 00:20.258
and if I don't make it
awesome, they may cancel it.

00:21.154 --> 00:24.067
I wonder if
I'm going to make it awesome.

00:24.224 --> 00:26.727
Or I could be South Korea,
you could be Bangladesh.

00:26.793 --> 00:29.103
We could form, like,
a trans-Asiatic alliance.

00:29.162 --> 00:31.108
Yeah, I like it.
And I see the merits of it.

00:31.164 --> 00:34.270
I just worry if we're both in
Asia, it might limit our scope.

00:34.834 --> 00:36.313
I kind of want to
roll up my sleeves

00:36.369 --> 00:39.009
and make geo-political
problem solving my bitch.

00:39.105 --> 00:42.609
Amen, brother. Let's go back to
Plan I'll be Denmark, you be Peru.

00:42.675 --> 00:43.676
Yes.

00:43.743 --> 00:48.351
You know, I didn't really do Model
United Nations in high school. So...

00:48.415 --> 00:50.622
Oh, wait. I super did.

00:50.717 --> 00:53.288
I need a few more volunteers.
Andy, will you be Iceland?

00:53.353 --> 00:55.663
The bad guys from Mighty Ducks Two?
Don't think so.

00:55.755 --> 00:56.927
Okay. How about Japan?

00:56.990 --> 01:00.460
The bad guys from
Karate Kid Two? Even worse.

01:00.527 --> 01:03.133
How about Germany? They've
never been the bad guys.

01:03.329 --> 01:05.400
Why don't you be Finland?
Okay.

01:05.465 --> 01:06.910
Okay?
And I'll be the Moon.

01:06.966 --> 01:09.742
No. You're gonna be
South Africa or Pakistan.

01:10.003 --> 01:12.005
I'm the Moon or I quit.
April.

01:12.072 --> 01:13.676
Moon or quit, man.

01:13.740 --> 01:16.744
Fine. You be South Africa, and then
you can also secretly run the Moon.

01:16.810 --> 01:18.983
The Moon accepts your
ridiculous proposal.

01:19.045 --> 01:21.889
Ron, you want to join us?
Look. I'll let you be America.

01:23.583 --> 01:25.824
And teach kids that not
only is government good,

01:25.885 --> 01:29.162
but that there should be
a worldwide super government?

01:29.222 --> 01:31.031
I'd rather sand down
my toenails.

01:31.391 --> 01:33.997
Every three weeks, I have
to sand down my toenails.

01:35.228 --> 01:37.037
They're too strong
for clippers.

01:39.000 --> 01:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:58.318 --> 02:00.696
Excuse me.
Are you Leslie Knope?

02:00.753 --> 02:02.562
What am I talking about?
Of course you are.

02:05.225 --> 02:08.467
Thank you so much for coming and
trying to help save our club.

02:08.527 --> 02:12.305
We're so excited to see a true Pawnee Model U.N.
legend in action.

02:12.398 --> 02:15.402
Thank you. I really wouldn't describe
myself as a Model U.N. legend.

02:15.468 --> 02:18.142
I'd go with
"icon." Or "hero."

02:18.538 --> 02:21.678
Look, if you ask me,
Enron is down, but not out.

02:21.741 --> 02:23.721
Who doesn't like
a comeback story?

02:23.776 --> 02:26.552
All right. If you want to hear
my plan, get at me later.

02:26.613 --> 02:27.956
I've got to meet up
with an old friend.

02:28.014 --> 02:29.391
All right. Peace, man.

02:29.782 --> 02:31.227
Let's go do this
lunch thing.

02:31.451 --> 02:33.260
I just have one more
quick interview.

02:33.319 --> 02:35.321
I'm still trying to
find your replacement.

02:35.788 --> 02:38.769
That is unless you want
your old job back?

02:38.825 --> 02:39.826
I told you before,
Ronseph.

02:39.893 --> 02:40.997
I've moved on
to bigger things.

02:41.194 --> 02:44.004
E 720 going under
was a blessing.

02:44.097 --> 02:46.099
I'm tearing it up
all over town like a boss.

02:46.432 --> 02:47.740
Sounds great, Tommy.

02:47.800 --> 02:50.872
I've offered Tom his job
back several times.

02:50.937 --> 02:52.245
And each time,
he's told me

02:52.305 --> 02:54.751
he's just too busy
being an entrepreneur.

02:54.941 --> 02:59.014
Then, two days ago, I saw him
spraying cologne samples at Macy's.

02:59.479 --> 03:01.686
The young man
has a lot of pride.

03:01.748 --> 03:03.887
This isn't gonna be easy.

03:04.717 --> 03:06.424
Ann Perkins. Hey, Chris.
How's it going?

03:06.486 --> 03:09.194
Not good. Can I talk to you?
Okay.

03:09.255 --> 03:11.963
I'm not sure if you're aware,
but I am romantically involved

03:12.025 --> 03:14.733
with Jerry Gergich's surprisingly
hot daughter, Millicent Gergich.

03:14.794 --> 03:17.673
Yeah, you were grinding with her pretty
hard at April's Halloween party.

03:17.964 --> 03:20.205
That's correct. Anyway,
we've been on four dates.

03:20.333 --> 03:23.610
But now, Millicent Gergich hasn't
returned my last two phone calls.

03:23.670 --> 03:26.514
I think our relationship may be
in trouble, and I don't know why.

03:26.573 --> 03:30.919
Wow. A four-date-long relationship
might not be 100% perfect?

03:30.977 --> 03:33.287
I think you should launch
a full-scale investigation.

03:34.080 --> 03:36.458
The root of sarcasm
is truth, Ann.

03:36.516 --> 03:39.224
I am going to launch
a full-scale investigation.

03:39.285 --> 03:41.765
And I sincerely thank you
for that suggestion.

03:42.088 --> 03:44.090
Glad I could help
in these trying times.

03:44.857 --> 03:47.303
Sarcasm again.
You're a delight.

03:49.762 --> 03:51.435
You have all been
preparing for months

03:51.497 --> 03:53.602
for this year's
geo-political scenario,

03:53.967 --> 03:55.605
Global Food Crisis.

03:55.802 --> 03:58.806
Security Council,
we need you to lead us

03:58.871 --> 04:01.408
or billions of people
will starve to death.

04:01.474 --> 04:03.784
But most importantly,
have fun.

04:05.511 --> 04:09.254
Due to my campaign, the romantic
aspect of our relationship is over.

04:09.315 --> 04:10.589
And I am totally
fine with that.

04:10.783 --> 04:12.091
But Ben and I have
so much in common.

04:12.151 --> 04:13.994
I mean,
we're amazing friends.

04:14.087 --> 04:17.159
And friendship is better,
because friends help you move.

04:17.223 --> 04:19.635
They drive you to the airport.

04:19.692 --> 04:23.071
Boyfriends just
love you and marry you.

04:25.498 --> 04:28.206
Jerry, I am launching
a full-scale investigation

04:28.268 --> 04:30.714
into my romantic relationship with
your daughter, Millicent Gergich,

04:30.770 --> 04:32.249
and I thought
I could pick your brain.

04:32.305 --> 04:33.978
Geez. I really shouldn't be
involved in something...

04:34.040 --> 04:35.144
Quick recap.

04:35.208 --> 04:36.448
Things were
going wonderfully.

04:36.509 --> 04:38.284
We clicked on
an emotional level.

04:38.444 --> 04:40.583
And then, suddenly, I just
stopped hearing from her.

04:40.947 --> 04:43.188
Now, you must know her
pretty well. What gives?

04:43.249 --> 04:44.557
Here's what I saw go down.

04:44.617 --> 04:46.597
Donna. Yeah.
Get in on this.

04:46.653 --> 04:49.463
You're too accessible. Every
time she calls, you answer.

04:49.656 --> 04:50.964
You've got to
dangle the carrot.

04:51.024 --> 04:52.833
Literally and metaphorically.

04:53.393 --> 04:54.497
Thank you, Donna.
Thanks, Donna.

04:54.827 --> 04:56.397
So, Courtney.

04:56.896 --> 04:59.877
This says
you retired in 1968.

04:59.932 --> 05:02.469
No, no, no.
I was fired because

05:02.535 --> 05:04.742
I made a pass
at an ethnic woman.

05:05.038 --> 05:07.644
And what have you been doing
for the last 43 years?

05:07.707 --> 05:11.484
You know, hitchhiking
around I went to Mexico.

05:11.544 --> 05:13.046
I met a lot of ethnic girls.

05:13.146 --> 05:15.251
They grow on trees down there.

05:15.315 --> 05:19.161
I was in jail for a spell. That
about brings it up to date.

05:19.419 --> 05:22.525
Sounds to me like you're ready to
get back in the game, Courtney.

05:22.689 --> 05:23.929
We'll be in touch.

05:25.858 --> 05:27.997
Another very strong candidate.

05:28.061 --> 05:31.167
Are you insane? He was
a million-year-old racist.

05:31.264 --> 05:33.835
He said he liked
ethnic girls, Tom.

05:33.900 --> 05:35.743
I'm sorry, Ron,
but I created a legacy here,

05:35.802 --> 05:37.543
and I need to make sure
it's protected.

05:37.603 --> 05:38.638
Let's bring in
some more people.

05:39.038 --> 05:42.349
In my four years here, I revolutionized
the position of Administrator

05:42.408 --> 05:43.819
and made this place cool.

05:43.876 --> 05:45.219
I was the first person
to abbreviate

05:45.278 --> 05:46.552
Parks and Recreation
Department.

05:46.612 --> 05:48.148
First, it was
Parks and Recreation.

05:48.281 --> 05:50.852
Then, Parks and Rec.
Then, P and R.

05:50.917 --> 05:54.558
Then, I lengthened it just a
little bit to Tommy's Place.

05:55.822 --> 05:57.028
Okay, wait a minute.
I think I have it.

05:57.090 --> 05:59.195
What if we dropped interest rates?
Would that help you?

05:59.258 --> 06:00.931
Maybe. But what if
Brazil and Argentina

06:00.993 --> 06:03.940
use their oil deposits
as collateral?

06:03.996 --> 06:05.236
Whoa. That's really good.

06:05.298 --> 06:07.574
Under-exaggerate much, France?

06:08.167 --> 06:09.305
Nice.

06:09.635 --> 06:11.137
Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom,
zoom, zoom.

06:11.471 --> 06:12.575
Hey, Leslie, you ready?
Ow!

06:12.872 --> 06:13.873
Sorry.
That's okay.

06:13.973 --> 06:15.577
Hi, William.
Hi. You ready?

06:15.641 --> 06:18.622
Yes. Absolutely. Um, they
want me to do a photo op

06:18.711 --> 06:21.317
for the campaign, so I can bolster
my education credentials.

06:21.381 --> 06:22.655
Can we just
press pause here?

06:22.915 --> 06:24.292
Well, how long
is it gonna take?

06:24.350 --> 06:26.728
I'm not really sure. Can you just
tread water until I'm ready?

06:27.286 --> 06:29.596
Oh, sure. Yeah, I'll just tread
water till you're ready.

06:29.655 --> 06:31.100
Thanks, buddy.

06:31.357 --> 06:32.927
Leslie and I
aren't dating anymore.

06:32.992 --> 06:35.632
But we're friends.
So it's fun.

06:35.695 --> 06:39.040
It's just fun.
It's fun. It's fun...

06:40.433 --> 06:41.776
It is fun.

06:42.235 --> 06:43.714
Thanks a lot.

06:44.170 --> 06:45.444
Yes! Honey.

06:46.606 --> 06:51.112
I just traded Finland's
military to Kenya for 50 lions.

06:52.245 --> 06:53.417
That's pretty good, right?

06:53.513 --> 06:55.151
Yeah.
Okay.

06:55.214 --> 06:59.162
But also, militaries are pretty
good at protecting countries.

06:59.218 --> 07:02.199
But so are lions. And you
don't have to pay them.

07:02.255 --> 07:03.666
These kids are idiots.

07:03.723 --> 07:05.566
I've just traded all of
Finland's boring stuff

07:05.625 --> 07:07.400
for every other
country's lions.

07:07.894 --> 07:10.101
I definitely have more lions

07:10.163 --> 07:11.904
than any other country
in the whole world right now.

07:11.964 --> 07:13.170
I have no idea
what's going on.

07:13.232 --> 07:15.178
But if that ends up meaning
something in this game,

07:15.535 --> 07:17.242
I'd say I'm set.

07:20.173 --> 07:22.710
Hey. So, Russia and China are
about to propose their own plans.

07:22.775 --> 07:24.777
So, the kids kind of
want to get ours out there.

07:24.844 --> 07:27.620
Um, okay. This should probably
take, like, five more minutes.

07:27.680 --> 07:29.159
Let's say
10 or 15 to be safe.

07:29.215 --> 07:31.161
Well, how about we
make it a cool 40?

07:31.217 --> 07:32.662
I'm sorry.
It's just important.

07:32.718 --> 07:33.788
Well, this is
important, too.

07:33.853 --> 07:35.093
I mean, it's kind of
why we came here.

07:35.154 --> 07:37.156
Sorry. Could you just step over here?
You're in the shot.

07:37.256 --> 07:38.860
Oh, of course.

07:40.226 --> 07:41.534
Her life is so awesome.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.571
You're lucky you're friends with her.
Shut up, Bulgaria.

07:47.834 --> 07:49.711
I know. Well, that's the
great thing about treaties.

07:49.769 --> 07:51.771
It doesn't even matter...
Hey! I'm back.

07:51.838 --> 07:54.751
Or as they say in Denmark, "I'm
back." Most people speak English.

07:54.807 --> 07:56.718
So, are you guys ready
to polish off this treaty?

07:56.776 --> 07:58.255
Oh, um...

07:58.311 --> 08:01.884
Actually, I merged our treaty
with Russia and China's treaty.

08:03.049 --> 08:04.722
I got cut out of my own treaty?
Yeah.

08:05.084 --> 08:06.654
I got sick of
treading water,

08:06.719 --> 08:10.098
so I swam over
to Asia and made a deal.

08:10.990 --> 08:13.994
The nation of Denmark would like
to formally request a summit

08:14.060 --> 08:16.939
with the nation of Peru over
there by the refreshment table.

08:16.996 --> 08:19.237
Because the nation of
Denmark needs a juice box.

08:20.566 --> 08:22.671
I am shocked and
appalled by the actions

08:22.735 --> 08:24.476
of the honorable
delegate from Peru.

08:24.537 --> 08:25.743
Leslie, just...

08:26.906 --> 08:30.217
Look. I thought I could handle
being friends with you.

08:30.409 --> 08:32.548
But I can't. Okay?

08:32.645 --> 08:33.749
Now, we agreed
the other night

08:33.813 --> 08:36.657
that we can't spend
time together.

08:37.717 --> 08:38.923
I think that was
the right call.

08:39.085 --> 08:40.325
But that was
in a romantic way.

08:40.385 --> 08:42.457
We can still spend
time together as friends.

08:42.522 --> 08:43.727
It doesn't work that way.

08:43.789 --> 08:45.325
You can't just
chop up the aspects

08:45.391 --> 08:47.302
of a relationship
into discrete parts

08:47.360 --> 08:49.931
and select the ones
you want like a buffet.

08:49.996 --> 08:50.997
Why not?

08:51.063 --> 08:53.065
Because it's selfish.

08:53.399 --> 08:54.742
Stop being obtuse.

08:56.068 --> 08:57.672
<i>Look, I understand
where he's coming from.</i>

08:57.737 --> 08:59.808
But I have been nothing
but straightforward with him.

08:59.872 --> 09:02.478
And if anyone in the entire
world should understand

09:02.542 --> 09:04.453
the difficult
position I'm in.

09:04.710 --> 09:06.656
It's just,
I have made an effort,

09:06.712 --> 09:09.090
and I've shared
my flags with him.

09:09.148 --> 09:11.594
And, suddenly, he doesn't
want to be friends?

09:11.684 --> 09:13.425
Well, you know what? That
leaves me with only one option.

09:13.486 --> 09:15.762
Just excuse me for...

09:16.923 --> 09:19.597
Attention! This is
an urgent world matter.

09:19.659 --> 09:21.070
Due to a recent betrayal,

09:21.127 --> 09:22.663
<i>my homeland,
the great state of Denmark,</i>

09:22.728 --> 09:26.107
has officially decided
to declare war on Peru.

09:26.732 --> 09:29.975
Scandinavian brothers.
On my signal.

09:30.036 --> 09:31.310
Unleash hell!

09:34.340 --> 09:36.320
See, I just don't
believe in this whole

09:36.375 --> 09:38.946
"don't let people know
how you feel" nonsense.

09:39.011 --> 09:40.490
I love telling people
how I feel.

09:40.580 --> 09:41.820
Mostly because
I love most people,

09:41.881 --> 09:43.224
and I love telling them
I love them.

09:43.416 --> 09:44.622
You didn't tell that girl,
you love her, did you?

09:44.684 --> 09:45.685
No. I'm not crazy.

09:45.751 --> 09:48.425
What is this urgent meeting
with Donna and Jerry?

09:48.487 --> 09:50.091
Ann Perkins.
I took your advice.

09:50.156 --> 09:51.601
My sarcastic advice?
Precisely.

09:51.657 --> 09:52.727
And we're getting
to the bottom of

09:52.792 --> 09:54.703
what's going on with me
and Jerry's daughter.

09:54.760 --> 09:57.468
And I thought you would be a tremendous
addition to this think tank.

09:57.530 --> 09:59.441
This is incredibly
inappropriate.

09:59.498 --> 10:00.875
Thank you.
Okay, I'm game.

10:03.269 --> 10:04.543
No, I'm not kidding.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.606
My name's Gary and
I'm from Gary, Indiana.

10:06.806 --> 10:07.910
Amazing.

10:07.974 --> 10:11.114
People like hearing that. It's
probably one of my stronger anecdotes.

10:11.177 --> 10:14.090
A fact is not
an anecdote, Gary.

10:14.447 --> 10:15.585
Here's an anecdote.

10:15.648 --> 10:19.027
Today, I met the most boring man in the world.
His name was Gary.

10:19.085 --> 10:20.086
Hmm.

10:20.353 --> 10:25.325
Now, Keith,
under "sex", you wrote,

10:25.391 --> 10:28.065
"Yes. Ha, ha.
Ha, ha. Ha, ha."

10:28.661 --> 10:30.163
Well played.
Thank you.

10:31.330 --> 10:33.571
But all jokes aside,
I'm a boy.

10:34.934 --> 10:36.675
Keith, I had this job
for four years.

10:36.736 --> 10:39.182
And I can tell you, you get out
of it what you put into it.

10:39.605 --> 10:40.811
What are you hoping
to get out of it?

10:41.040 --> 10:42.348
In, like, a month or so.

10:42.408 --> 10:43.409
What?

10:43.476 --> 10:46.821
Oh "What." What am I hoping
to get out of this job?

10:46.879 --> 10:47.880
Yeah.

10:47.947 --> 10:50.450
Yeah.
Like, one month of money.

10:50.883 --> 10:52.191
Would be just right.

10:53.019 --> 10:54.054
Let me give you
a situation.

10:54.420 --> 10:56.991
You're hosting a town hall
meeting for local businesses.

10:57.590 --> 11:01.265
That's so much stuff. You just went...
Kept on going.

11:01.327 --> 11:03.671
That was, like, one thing. I didn't
even get to the situation yet.

11:04.096 --> 11:05.097
Oh!

11:05.564 --> 11:06.838
All right.

11:06.899 --> 11:10.369
Well, thanks, guys.
I think we've all seen enough.

11:11.270 --> 11:13.841
Still not totally sure
what I'm applying for,

11:13.906 --> 11:17.217
but if you ask me,
I think it went pretty well.

11:17.943 --> 11:20.651
What we need to focus on
is how to destroy Peru.

11:20.713 --> 11:22.624
Specifically,
one person who lives there.

11:22.882 --> 11:25.226
Madam Ambassador, are you
changing the scenario?

11:25.284 --> 11:26.627
We didn't prepare for this.

11:26.686 --> 11:29.360
Global politics can change
and scenarios can arise.

11:29.422 --> 11:30.492
And suddenly,
you're just like,

11:30.556 --> 11:31.591
"Wait, l thought
this one thing.

11:31.657 --> 11:32.931
"But look over there,
that's a different thing.

11:32.992 --> 11:34.733
"And it's changing everything."
And I'm like, "What?

11:34.794 --> 11:36.774
"Hold up..."

11:36.829 --> 11:38.137
Who has tanks for me?

11:38.197 --> 11:41.576
I'm sorry, but we're gonna keep
trying to solve the food crisis.

11:41.634 --> 11:45.878
Food, shmood. This is war. God, it's
time for you to nut up, Switzerland.

11:46.672 --> 11:49.812
Well, well, well. Look who is brave
enough to show his face in Europe.

11:50.376 --> 11:53.914
Say the word, Leslie I'll sic
my army of lions on him.

11:53.979 --> 11:56.482
Okay, look. I think things
are starting to get

11:56.549 --> 11:57.550
a little
out of control here.

11:57.616 --> 12:00.028
I agree. You betrayed me
and you went behind my back.

12:00.086 --> 12:01.121
And now, you need to pay.

12:02.254 --> 12:03.528
I need to pay?

12:03.889 --> 12:06.301
Do I stutter?
Okay. Fair enough.

12:06.358 --> 12:08.804
Oh. You know what?
You might want to borrow this.

12:09.061 --> 12:11.632
No one wants your dirty underwear, Ben.
It's not dirty underwear.

12:11.864 --> 12:13.537
It's a white flag,
and you may as well

12:13.599 --> 12:14.976
start waving it
right now, Leslie.

12:15.034 --> 12:16.069
The only thing
I will be waving

12:16.135 --> 12:17.409
is your decapitated
head on a stick

12:17.470 --> 12:19.609
in front of your
weeping mother.

12:21.841 --> 12:22.842
Good Lord.

12:23.342 --> 12:24.514
They were duds, Ron.

12:24.710 --> 12:25.711
Really, anything
would be better

12:25.778 --> 12:27.280
than the people
we interviewed today.

12:27.346 --> 12:28.882
I guess
you're right, Tom.

12:28.948 --> 12:30.621
I'm not going to
find another you.

12:30.716 --> 12:31.956
You were perfect.

12:32.518 --> 12:35.226
Competent enough to keep
the bosses off my back,

12:35.287 --> 12:37.927
but selfish enough
to slow down all the work.

12:38.324 --> 12:40.326
Tom Haverfords
don't grow on trees.

12:40.392 --> 12:43.669
If they did,
I'd sell them. Tommy Trees.

12:43.929 --> 12:45.533
Would you
consider coming back?

12:46.699 --> 12:48.337
Sorry, Ron. No can do.

12:48.701 --> 12:50.237
I'm like a shark.
I don't swim backwards.

12:50.803 --> 12:52.282
See you later, man.

12:54.807 --> 12:56.582
We have been
making great strides

12:56.642 --> 12:58.349
with genetically
modified crops,

12:58.511 --> 13:00.991
and would gladly pledge
to continue the growth of...

13:01.046 --> 13:02.923
Excuse me, Madam Ambassador.
Excuse me.

13:02.982 --> 13:04.222
I'm not finished.
Oh, really?

13:04.283 --> 13:07.025
Then, why do I
have the microphone?

13:07.153 --> 13:11.431
I move that the Security Council
formally condemn Denmark

13:11.490 --> 13:13.367
and stop them
from making anymore

13:13.425 --> 13:15.336
unwarranted
acts of aggression.

13:15.394 --> 13:18.102
As long as you quit
derailing the conference.

13:18.164 --> 13:19.768
People are dying
of hunger in Africa.

13:19.832 --> 13:21.175
Oh, cry me a river.

13:21.233 --> 13:22.940
All in favor of
the resolution.

13:25.271 --> 13:26.443
- What?
- Oh.

13:26.505 --> 13:30.112
That's interesting. The resolution
passes with flying colors.

13:30.176 --> 13:32.782
Denmark is formally condemned.

13:32.845 --> 13:34.017
Bam!

13:35.981 --> 13:37.858
That's no problemo, Peru.

13:37.917 --> 13:40.557
Because Denmark no longer
recognizes the authority

13:40.619 --> 13:42.724
of this international
gang of thugs.

13:42.788 --> 13:47.533
And history will be unkind to those
who stand opposed to justice.

13:47.726 --> 13:50.798
Together we stand.
And I ask all of you,

13:51.230 --> 13:54.074
who is ready to join
the coalition of the willing?

13:56.502 --> 13:58.812
The Moon shall
join your coalition.

13:58.871 --> 14:00.475
Yeah. We got
the freaking Moon.

14:00.539 --> 14:02.348
What are you going to do
without tides, Peru?

14:03.709 --> 14:05.655
Okay. We need to stop
dealing in hypotheticals.

14:06.078 --> 14:08.684
Ann, we dated.
What happened to us?

14:08.747 --> 14:11.557
Really?
Do you want to get real?

14:11.617 --> 14:13.221
Sure. Sounds like fun.

14:13.285 --> 14:16.459
Sometimes, your relentless
cheeriness is confusing.

14:17.089 --> 14:18.261
Like that time
we went to Eagleton

14:18.324 --> 14:20.497
and we got that hotel room
with the Jacuzzi.

14:20.559 --> 14:23.199
This just got real good.
And the Jacuzzi broke.

14:23.262 --> 14:25.833
But I did eat food
off of your body.

14:25.998 --> 14:28.171
Oh, come on. DONNA: All
right, Chris and Ann.

14:28.601 --> 14:30.842
I just want to
go back to work.

14:31.237 --> 14:34.741
So, the coalition of the willing is
Denmark, Botswana, and the Moon.

14:34.907 --> 14:36.079
The Big Three.

14:36.141 --> 14:37.245
Now, here's what
we're gonna do.

14:37.309 --> 14:40.483
Ben is probably shoring up his
support in South America.

14:40.546 --> 14:42.389
While he does that,
we are going to make sure...

14:42.448 --> 14:43.825
Attention!

14:43.883 --> 14:46.329
The Security Council
has decided to expel

14:46.385 --> 14:48.865
Peru and Denmark
from the United Nations.

14:51.390 --> 14:53.836
'Cause you guys suck.
Look around.

14:54.526 --> 14:57.166
We thought you were going to
teach us how to solve problems.

14:57.630 --> 15:00.167
You've ruined my favorite club.
Thanks a lot.

15:01.500 --> 15:02.501
Did we win?

15:03.135 --> 15:04.739
I think we won.

15:04.803 --> 15:07.682
What were we trying to do?
I learned so much today.

15:13.846 --> 15:15.723
I just wanted to say

15:15.781 --> 15:17.124
that I thought
it was really cool

15:17.182 --> 15:20.026
how everything
fell apart in there.

15:21.487 --> 15:23.592
And also, maybe you
should talk to Ben. No.

15:24.089 --> 15:26.592
He's being a jerk.
Please?

15:27.026 --> 15:30.473
When Ben gets upset, he becomes
a really bad roommate.

15:30.863 --> 15:34.777
He takes really long sadness baths
and makes me late for stuff.

15:37.202 --> 15:40.046
I hate it here.
I can't wait to graduate.

15:43.309 --> 15:46.415
Yeah, but summer is
gonna totally kick ass.

15:47.446 --> 15:51.189
So, you're saying
that I intimidated you?

15:51.250 --> 15:52.456
No. Not exactly.

15:52.518 --> 15:55.192
Come on. Talk more about that
tantric workshop y'all went to.

15:55.254 --> 15:57.234
I was so into you, okay?

15:57.289 --> 16:00.293
And you basically turned me into
a female version of yourself.

16:00.359 --> 16:01.497
And then,
you got bored dating me,

16:01.560 --> 16:02.664
'cause you were
dating yourself.

16:03.696 --> 16:04.834
Huh.

16:04.897 --> 16:07.275
I mean, I was jogging
I hate jogging.

16:07.433 --> 16:10.346
Jogging's amazing.
Jogging is the worst, Chris.

16:10.402 --> 16:12.882
I mean, I know it keeps you healthy.
But, God, at what cost?

16:13.105 --> 16:15.278
Well, I'm sorry that I added
five years to your life.

16:16.342 --> 16:17.514
Now I'm being sarcastic.

16:17.576 --> 16:20.056
Like you. I'm doing
something that you like.

16:20.145 --> 16:23.183
Being with you definitely made
me do a lot of soul-searching.

16:23.248 --> 16:26.661
And I came out the other side being
a much more self-possessed person.

16:26.952 --> 16:28.898
Well, I'm glad.
Good luck with Millicent.

16:28.954 --> 16:32.834
Just back off a little bit. Let her be herself.
Everything will be fine.

16:33.258 --> 16:34.396
Thank you.

16:34.793 --> 16:38.764
If you re-arrange the letters of
Peru, you can spell "Europe."

16:38.831 --> 16:40.242
That's not true.

16:40.499 --> 16:42.274
Well, you have to
rearrange them.

16:42.735 --> 16:45.739
Delegates! I know that you
are angry with each other.

16:45.804 --> 16:47.306
Hopefully, this will be
your opportunity

16:47.373 --> 16:49.717
to have your
very own Camp David.

16:50.309 --> 16:52.482
In high school,
my buddy, David Fundis,

16:52.544 --> 16:54.649
would have these
campouts in his backyard.

16:54.747 --> 16:57.921
We would just chill out,
have a bonfire,

16:57.983 --> 16:59.792
talk about whatever
was on our mind.

17:00.185 --> 17:02.631
We called it Camp David.

17:02.888 --> 17:04.299
How do you know
about Camp David?

17:04.455 --> 17:06.766
- How do you know about Camp David?
- Okay.

17:07.526 --> 17:08.903
You guys are
being stupid.

17:08.961 --> 17:11.099
So why don't you work it
out while Andy and I...

17:11.163 --> 17:14.007
Throw these scientist
bottles off the roof.

17:14.133 --> 17:16.339
No. APRIL: That's right.
See you.

17:16.702 --> 17:18.409
Go, go, go.

17:20.406 --> 17:22.317
It's bad enough that
we can't be together,

17:22.374 --> 17:24.148
but the thought
of us not being friends

17:24.209 --> 17:26.951
is just too crappy
for me to handle.

17:27.146 --> 17:31.617
I was perhaps a little
icier than I needed to be.

17:32.117 --> 17:34.256
I just need you
to be in my life.

17:34.953 --> 17:36.728
You're too important to me.

17:36.789 --> 17:38.393
I wish I could
say it's possible.

17:38.457 --> 17:40.437
I just, I don't know
if it is right now.

17:42.461 --> 17:44.600
Well, I propose a treaty

17:45.264 --> 17:49.076
that states that we have
a fun conversation once a day,

17:49.134 --> 17:51.375
at work, for five minutes.

17:51.804 --> 17:55.308
I'll take it to the Peruvian Senate.
Or whatever.

17:55.507 --> 17:57.578
Please do that. I'll try.
I'll see what they say.

17:57.876 --> 17:59.378
What do we do
with those kids?

17:59.445 --> 18:01.220
We totally
ruined their club.

18:01.447 --> 18:03.825
I can tell you what I would
like when I was their age.

18:04.016 --> 18:05.791
Ben, how are we going
to get Kathy Ireland

18:05.851 --> 18:07.558
to do naked
aerobics for them?

18:07.619 --> 18:10.190
Okay. I regret
telling you that. Very much.

18:12.491 --> 18:14.698
Hey.
Hey, Ron.

18:14.760 --> 18:17.366
All right.
I've got to come clean.

18:17.429 --> 18:20.376
I saw you spraying
cologne samples at Macy's.

18:20.432 --> 18:22.537
What? Macy's?
That wasn't me.

18:22.601 --> 18:24.877
There's a Macy's in town?
Where is the Macy's in town?

18:24.937 --> 18:27.178
I heard they have an amazing
cologne sample guy.

18:27.239 --> 18:29.981
Just take the job, Tommy
Come on back.

18:30.075 --> 18:31.713
I quit
to pursue my dream.

18:31.944 --> 18:34.584
And my dream collapsed.
It's embarrassing, Ron.

18:34.646 --> 18:35.818
I can't go from
being a CEO

18:35.881 --> 18:37.485
back to being
an administrator.

18:37.983 --> 18:42.125
Is there anything I can do to make
you feel okay about coming back?

18:42.921 --> 18:44.127
Everyone, please.

18:45.257 --> 18:48.329
Help me.
I am trying to get Tom back.

18:48.760 --> 18:51.240
I'm begging.

18:52.664 --> 18:55.201
This department just
doesn't work without you.

18:55.267 --> 18:56.803
What do you say?

18:56.869 --> 19:00.043
Ron, this is embarrassing.
Even for you.

19:01.073 --> 19:03.075
I'm not coming back.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.917
Peace out, my dudes.

19:07.312 --> 19:09.087
EXCUSE me, everyone.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.489
That was great.
So, what I'm thinking is

19:16.555 --> 19:17.625
I'll come back in a few days,

19:17.689 --> 19:19.430
you'll beg me again...

19:19.892 --> 19:21.667
So, if it's okay
with you guys,

19:21.727 --> 19:23.707
I would like to
ask Ron for my job back.

19:24.296 --> 19:27.368
Ron, may I have
my job back, please?

19:29.401 --> 19:30.744
Thank you.

19:32.271 --> 19:34.217
I will see you all Monday.

19:34.273 --> 19:35.980
Looking forward to it.

19:38.377 --> 19:39.481
Ah, France!

19:40.779 --> 19:43.885
My name is Cassidy, and I'm
really annoyed with you.

19:43.949 --> 19:45.292
Yes. And you have
every right to be,

19:45.350 --> 19:46.351
but we're hoping
what we're going

19:46.418 --> 19:48.125
to show you right now
will make up for that.

19:49.388 --> 19:50.731
What?

19:50.923 --> 19:53.426
The Pawnee city
council chambers.

19:53.492 --> 19:56.735
The nicest room in City Hall by
a factor of, like, a million.

19:57.529 --> 19:59.008
Go ahead. Sit down.

19:59.665 --> 20:03.943
Leslie and I feel terrible for war
breaking out at your Model U.N.

20:04.002 --> 20:05.675
Which, for the record,
Denmark would have won.

20:05.737 --> 20:06.909
But that's neither here nor there.
All right.

20:07.139 --> 20:08.675
Thanks to
a coordinated effort

20:08.740 --> 20:11.152
between the Parks Department
and the City Manager's office,

20:11.210 --> 20:12.712
three months from now,
we are going to hold

20:12.778 --> 20:15.554
a statewide Model U.N.
in this room.

20:15.614 --> 20:17.855
And you're gonna run the show.
What?

20:17.916 --> 20:20.556
And we will just be...
Not here.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.657
Or taking some small
countries No,no,no.

20:22.721 --> 20:23.927
No. Fine. Not here.

20:24.323 --> 20:26.098
- Sound good?
- Yes.

20:26.491 --> 20:28.368
Those kids are
passionate about something.

20:28.927 --> 20:30.406
That's important.

20:30.462 --> 20:32.635
That's all there is,
really, is passion.

20:33.932 --> 20:36.503
Passion is what
makes for good treaties,

20:37.035 --> 20:39.709
good relationships,
good pizza,

20:40.205 --> 20:42.446
good friends, good everything.

20:43.308 --> 20:44.810
Including wars.

20:50.015 --> 20:52.552
Ladies and gentlemen, he was
gone but never forgotten.

20:52.618 --> 20:56.361
He makes all the ladies want...
No, I'm not gonna say that.

20:56.421 --> 20:59.527
Swagger.
Beats. And I get the...

20:59.725 --> 21:01.466
Who's... All right, forget it.

21:01.526 --> 21:03.403
Welcome back, Tom Haverford!

21:05.564 --> 21:07.703
Tick, took.
It's Tommy Time.

21:07.766 --> 21:10.246
Okay, I'm sorry.
I have to object again.

21:10.302 --> 21:11.872
This just seems unfair.

21:11.937 --> 21:14.941
I understand that, Jerry, but the
problem is is that Tom came back.

21:15.007 --> 21:17.453
And Andy's my assistant, so I
kind of need him close to me.

21:17.509 --> 21:19.580
Okay. But see,
I can't even hear anything

21:19.645 --> 21:21.682
because of
the noise from the copier.

21:21.747 --> 21:23.090
I'm sorry.
These are really important.
