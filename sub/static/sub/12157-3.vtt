WEBVTT

00:03.037 --> 00:04.872
HEY, MOM, WHY WAS DAD
OUT FRONT WASHING MY CAR?

00:04.905 --> 00:06.540
OH, SOME KIDS DROVE
THROUGH THE NEIGHBORHOOD

00:06.574 --> 00:08.142
EGGING CARS LAST NIGHT.

00:08.176 --> 00:10.078
ONLY IN COLORADO.
30 DAYS YOU GOTTA WAIT

00:10.111 --> 00:13.214
FOR A GUN PERMIT,
BUT ANYBODY CAN BUY EGGS!

00:14.915 --> 00:16.384
ADMIT IT.
YOU JUST WASHED MY CAR

00:16.417 --> 00:18.686
SO YOU COULD SCRAPE OFF
MY OBAMA STICKER.

00:18.719 --> 00:21.889
I THINK YOUR OBAMA STICKER'S
THE REASON YOU GOT EGGED.

00:23.124 --> 00:25.059
HOW MANY CARS GOT HIT?

00:25.093 --> 00:26.994
ON THIS BLOCK, JUST US
AND THE NEW GUYS UP THE BLOCK.

00:27.027 --> 00:29.029
THE NEW FAMILY? THE BLA...

00:29.063 --> 00:31.665
AFRICAN-AMERICAN FAMILY?

00:31.699 --> 00:34.868
THE BLAFRICAN-AMERICANS,
YES.

00:34.902 --> 00:38.172
SO NOW THEIR CAR IS THE ONLY ONE
ON THE BLOCK WITH EGG ON IT?

00:38.206 --> 00:40.574
OH, NO.
"OH, NO," WHAT?

00:40.608 --> 00:42.009
(sighs) WELL,
THEY COULD THINK

00:42.042 --> 00:44.112
SOMEONE EGGED THEIR CAR
OUT OF RACISM.

00:44.145 --> 00:46.980
I DON'T THINK THE KLAN
DOES A LOT OF WORK WITH EGGS.

00:48.716 --> 00:51.585
COME ON, THEY JUST MOVED INTO
A VERY WHITE NEIGHBORHOOD.

00:51.619 --> 00:54.054
MAYBE WE SHOULD LET THEM KNOW
THAT THEY WEREN'T THE ONLY ONES.

00:54.088 --> 00:55.856
I DON'T WANT TO TALK
TO MY NEIGHBORS.
YEAH, I KNOW.

00:55.889 --> 00:58.526
IF IT'LL HELP,
YOU WANT ME TO RE-EGG HER CAR?

00:58.559 --> 01:00.194
THEY MIGHT FEEL SINGLED OUT.

01:00.228 --> 01:03.531
OH, "SINGLED OUT." VANDALISM
HAPPENS TO EVERYBODY, GUYS.

01:03.564 --> 01:05.199
WHY IS IT IF YOU'RE BLACK
OR YOU'RE GAY

01:05.233 --> 01:07.135
OR YOU'RE A MIDGET,
YOU THINK STUFF HAPPENS TO YOU

01:07.168 --> 01:10.638
JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE BLACK OR
YOU'RE GAY OR YOU'RE A MIDGET?

01:10.671 --> 01:11.972
MAYBE THEY'RE JUST JERKS.

01:12.005 --> 01:13.774
I DATED THIS BLACK GAY MIDGET
IN COLLEGE...

01:13.807 --> 01:15.943
(mouths words)

01:15.976 --> 01:18.379
(chuckling) DAD, STOP,
OKAY?

01:18.412 --> 01:19.947
I'M GLAD THE VIEW IS SO CLEAR

01:19.980 --> 01:22.283
ON TOP OF RICH WHITE GUY
MOUNTAIN.

01:22.316 --> 01:25.319
BEAUTIFUL VIEW UP HERE.
THEY PUT A LITTLE FOOD COURT.

01:25.353 --> 01:27.555
LOVE YOU, GUYS.

01:27.588 --> 01:29.257
(door closes)
YOU KNOW, HONEY,
KRISTIN'S RIGHT.

01:29.290 --> 01:32.126
THE LARABEES SHOULD KNOW
THAT THEY WEREN'T SINGLED OUT.

01:32.160 --> 01:33.927
WHO ARE THE LARABEES?

01:33.961 --> 01:35.963
THE PEOPLE THAT WE HAVE
JUST BEEN TALKING ABOUT.

01:35.996 --> 01:38.132
OH, YEAH. THE GUY
IN THE SILVER TAHOE.

01:38.166 --> 01:39.567
OH, SURE. YOU KNOW
WHAT KIND OF CAR HE DRIVES,

01:39.600 --> 01:41.169
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW HIS NAME?

01:41.202 --> 01:42.970
I DON'T LIKE PEOPLE THAT MUCH,
BUT I LOVE CARS.

01:43.003 --> 01:46.607
THEY MOVED IN THE HOUSE
WHERE THE PONTIACS USED TO LIVE.

01:46.640 --> 01:48.142
YOU TALK TO THE NEIGHBORS,

01:48.176 --> 01:50.077
THEY'RE GONNA THINK
YOU WANT TO BE FRIENDS.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.312
AND?

01:51.345 --> 01:54.081
I DON'T WANT TO BE
FRIENDS WITH THEM.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.683
AND NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE BLACK,
BECAUSE THEY'RE--

01:55.716 --> 01:58.118
BECAUSE THEY'RE NEIGHBORS?
(groans)
RIGHT.

01:58.152 --> 01:59.687
YOU MAKE FRIENDS
WITH NEIGHBORS,

01:59.720 --> 02:01.955
AND IT OPENS UP ALL SORTS
OF OBLIGATIONS.

02:01.989 --> 02:03.691
YOU KNOW, LISTEN,
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO,

02:03.724 --> 02:07.094
YOU KNOW, REMEMBER THEIR NAMES,
WAVE AT 'EM AND SAY "HELLO."

02:07.127 --> 02:10.364
YOU KNOW, "HEY, MIKE,
HOW ARE YOU DOING TODAY?"

02:10.398 --> 02:13.033
WHO'S GOT AN ANSWER
FOR THAT?

02:13.066 --> 02:16.637
EVERYONE IN THE WORLD
NAMED MIKE EXCEPT FOR YOU.

02:18.239 --> 02:21.242
-- Captions by VITA --

02:23.844 --> 02:26.980
(both laughing)

02:27.014 --> 02:29.016
HEY. THE BRONCOS ARE ALMOST ON.
WHERE WERE YOU?

02:29.049 --> 02:30.351
THE MALL.

02:30.384 --> 02:32.320
TWO QUESTIONS--WHAT WERE YOU
DOING AT THE MALL,

02:32.353 --> 02:35.389
AND DID YOU BRING ME
A BIG PRETZEL?

02:35.423 --> 02:36.990
DAD, CHECK IT OUT.

02:37.024 --> 02:39.026
SHE'S LIKE THE PLAIN GIRL
IN THE MOVIE

02:39.059 --> 02:40.728
WHO DISCOVERS THAT
SHE CAN BE PRETTY...

02:40.761 --> 02:44.798
(singsongy) WITH THE HELP
OF HER SUPER HOT SISTER!

02:44.832 --> 02:47.801
(normal voice) WHAT?! I SAID
YOU WERE EVENTUALLY PRETTY.

02:47.835 --> 02:50.037
EVE, COME ON.
LET'S NOT MISS KICKOFF.

02:50.070 --> 02:52.206
BUT, DAD, I WANTED TO TRY ON
THIS NEW DRESS WITH THE SHOES

02:52.240 --> 02:54.308
MANDY IS LOANING ME FOR
TAYLOR'S PARTY FRIDAY NIGHT.

02:54.342 --> 02:55.843
YOU'VE GOT PRACTICE
FRIDAY NIGHT.

02:55.876 --> 02:57.144
YOU GOT A SOCCER GAME
SATURDAY, BABE.

02:57.177 --> 02:58.979
DAD, EVE IS
IN HIGH SCHOOL NOW.

02:59.012 --> 03:02.216
AND EVEN IF SHE DIDN'T
HAVE TO LIVE UP TO THIS...

03:04.017 --> 03:05.919
(exhales)

03:05.953 --> 03:07.888
WHERE WAS I GOING
WITH THAT?

03:09.122 --> 03:11.759
(whispers) JUST GO.

03:11.792 --> 03:14.562
DAD, I WAS, UH,
I WAS KINDA HOPING

03:14.595 --> 03:16.230
I COULD, UM, BLOW OFF
PRACTICE FRIDAY NIGHT.

03:16.264 --> 03:18.031
NO, YOU CAN'T BLOW OFF
PRACTICE.

03:18.065 --> 03:19.333
WHY? EVE SCORES
ALL THE GOALS ANYWAY.

03:19.367 --> 03:20.934
IF SHE'S NOT THERE,
ONE OF THOSE OTHER

03:20.968 --> 03:23.637
FUTURE GYM TEACHERS
CAN KICK A FEW.

03:25.038 --> 03:26.674
PLEASE, DAD.
I'M SO BURNED OUT ON SOCCER.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.175
I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR ANYTHING FUN,

03:28.208 --> 03:30.278
BECAUSE ALL I DO IS
PRACTICE SPORTS AND PLAY SPORTS.

03:30.311 --> 03:33.013
AND AS A REWARD, YOU GET
TO WATCH SPORTS WITH DAD.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.582
(scoffs) SO YOU'RE NOT EVEN
GONNA LET ME MISS

03:34.615 --> 03:36.049
ONE STUPID PRACTICE?

03:36.083 --> 03:38.919
YOU CAN MISS STUPID PRACTICE.
YOU CAN'T MISS SOCCER PRACTICE.

03:38.952 --> 03:41.188
YOU START FLAKING OUT
ON STUFF LIKE THIS,

03:41.221 --> 03:42.923
YOU MIGHT AS WELL
JUST QUIT THE TEAM.

03:42.956 --> 03:45.125
FINE. THEN I QUIT.
YOU'RE NOT QUITTING.

03:45.158 --> 03:46.960
THAT'S A SLIPPERY SLOPE.
YOU DO THAT, YOU END UP

03:46.994 --> 03:48.896
DRIVING AROUND WITH THESE
JERKS EGGING CARS.

03:48.929 --> 03:51.599
YEAH. LIKE RANDY AND MAX
WOULD HANG OUT WITH EVE, DAD.

03:51.632 --> 03:53.634
THEY'RE SENIORS. (laughs)

04:02.343 --> 04:04.978
(rings doorbell)

04:08.616 --> 04:10.984
HI. I SAW YOUR NEWSPAPER,

04:11.018 --> 04:12.986
AND I THOUGHT
I'D BRING IT TO YOU.

04:13.020 --> 04:16.790
UH, THERE'S A NEWSPAPER THIEF
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

04:18.826 --> 04:20.661
WE DON'T GET THE NEWSPAPER.

04:22.996 --> 04:26.400
(laughs) THEN I GUESS
I'M THE NEWSPAPER THIEF.

04:26.434 --> 04:28.168
(laughs)
UH...

04:28.201 --> 04:30.804
HI. I'M, UH, I'M VANESSA BAXTER
FROM DOWN THE STREET.

04:30.838 --> 04:32.172
OH, YES. NICE TO MEET YOU.

04:32.205 --> 04:34.107
I'M CAROL LARABEE.
HI.

04:34.141 --> 04:35.909
(clears throat)

04:35.943 --> 04:39.347
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT? UM...
I-I ALSO WANTED TO TELL YOU

04:39.380 --> 04:41.181
THAT SOMEBODY THREW
A-AN EGG AT YOUR CAR.

04:41.214 --> 04:43.517
OH.
UM, BUT--BUT THEY ALSO
THREW EGGS AT OTHER CARS,

04:43.551 --> 04:45.786
AND I DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO THINK YOU WERE SINGLED OUT

04:45.819 --> 04:48.689
BECAUSE YOU'RE...
(stammers)

04:49.790 --> 04:50.991
NEW.

04:51.024 --> 04:53.260
THAT'S NICE OF YOU.
YEAH.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.796
IS YOUR HUSBAND THE MAN
THAT DRIVES A GREEN TRUCK

04:55.829 --> 04:59.166
WHO WALKS INSIDE REALLY FAST
WITHOUT LOOKING UP?
OH. MM.

04:59.199 --> 05:00.534
YEAH, THAT'S HIM.
THAT'S HIM.

05:00.568 --> 05:03.437
BUT--BUT HE DOES THAT WITH ALL
THE NEIGHBORS, NOT JUST THE...

05:03.471 --> 05:04.805
THE NEW ONES?
YEAH.

05:06.340 --> 05:08.175
CAROL, THE OVEN'S
ON FIRE.

05:08.208 --> 05:10.043
UH, NO, IT'S OKAY.
(chuckles) IT'S OKAY.

05:10.077 --> 05:12.446
IT'S JUST MY HUSBAND'S WAY
OF GETTING RID OF SOLICITORS.

05:12.480 --> 05:14.281
HONEY, THIS IS OUR NEIGHBOR
FROM DOWN THE STREET...
OH. HI.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.016
VANESSA BAXTER.
VANESSA, MY HUSBAND--CHUCK.
HI.

05:16.049 --> 05:17.217
PLEASURE.
PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.
HI.

05:17.250 --> 05:20.053
HER HUSBAND'S THE GUY
WITH THE GREEN TRUCK.

05:20.087 --> 05:23.957
THE ONE WITH THE "NoBAMA"
BUMPER STICKER?

05:23.991 --> 05:25.693
THE GUY WHO NEVER WAVES?

05:25.726 --> 05:27.795
EH, YOU KNOW, HE'S--
YOU KNOW, HE'S JUST ANTISOCIAL.

05:27.828 --> 05:28.996
AND HE DOESN'T LIKE OBAMA.

05:29.029 --> 05:30.698
I SEE.

05:30.731 --> 05:34.201
BUT--BUT IT'S--IT'S NOT
IN THE WAY THAT YOU'RE THINKING.

05:35.836 --> 05:38.205
HOW AM I THINKING?

05:44.344 --> 05:46.580
(door opens)

05:46.614 --> 05:48.181
HEY.
HEY.

05:48.215 --> 05:49.483
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

05:49.517 --> 05:51.985
(sighs) WELL, FIRST
THE GOOD NEWS.

05:52.019 --> 05:55.523
I STOLE TODAY'S PAPER.

05:55.556 --> 05:57.190
THERE'S BAD NEWS?

05:57.224 --> 05:58.726
THE LARABEES ARE COMING
OVER HERE

05:58.759 --> 06:00.060
FOR DRINKS FRIDAY NIGHT.

06:00.093 --> 06:03.163
WHO ARE THE LARABEES?

06:03.196 --> 06:04.598
THE NEW NEIGHBORS.

06:04.632 --> 06:08.068
THE--THE TAHOES WHO BOUGHT
THE PONTIACS' HOUSE.

06:08.101 --> 06:09.937
WHY ARE THEY COMING
OVER HERE?

06:09.970 --> 06:11.605
I DON'T KNOW, HONESTLY.

06:11.639 --> 06:13.373
I WENT OVER THERE
TO TALK ABOUT THE EGGING.

06:13.407 --> 06:15.075
THINGS GOT AWKWARD.

06:15.108 --> 06:18.879
I PANICKED, AND I RAN OUT
OF STUFF TO SAY.

06:18.912 --> 06:22.082
SO NATURALLY YOU ASSUMED,
"MIKE'LL WANT A PIECE OF THIS.

06:23.951 --> 06:26.386
SO LET'S DO IT AGAIN
FRIDAY NIGHT"?

06:26.420 --> 06:28.188
WE GOT A BIGGER PROBLEM.

06:28.221 --> 06:29.957
YOUR YOUNGEST DAUGHTER
WANTS TO QUIT SOCCER.

06:29.990 --> 06:32.292
SO? WHAT DO YOU CARE?
YOU HATE SOCCER.

06:32.325 --> 06:34.127
I ALSO HATE OUR NEIGHBORS.

06:34.161 --> 06:37.130
THAT DIDN'T STOP YOU
FROM INVITING THEM OVER HERE.

06:37.164 --> 06:39.132
SHE PLAYS SOCCER WELL.
IT'S A WASTE OF TALENT.

06:39.166 --> 06:42.035
HEY, ARE YOU GUYS
TALKING ABOUT ME?

06:42.069 --> 06:43.771
NO, WE'RE NOT.

06:43.804 --> 06:45.873
OH. 'CAUSE I JUST HEARD
THE WORD "TALENT,"

06:45.906 --> 06:47.207
AND I THOUGHT YOU
MUST HAVE HEARD--

06:47.240 --> 06:49.477
(singsongy) I'M UP FOR A SOLO
IN SHOW CHOIR!

06:49.510 --> 06:50.978
THAT'S GREAT.

06:51.011 --> 06:53.080
I JUST DON'T WANT EVE TO THINK
SHE CAN BE A QUITTER.

06:53.113 --> 06:54.548
OH, COME ON, HONEY.
SHE'S SO TALENTED,

06:54.582 --> 06:56.484
SHE COULD DO ANYTHING
SHE PUTS HER MIND TO.

06:56.517 --> 06:59.119
KINDA LIKE ME IN SHOW CHOIR!

06:59.152 --> 07:02.055
THAT'S GOOD, HONEY.
YOU GO DO THAT.
RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.

07:02.089 --> 07:03.557
LOOK, WE'VE PUT SO MUCH
ENERGY INTO THIS.

07:03.591 --> 07:04.992
JUST THE DRIVING ALONE
TO AND FROM THAT PARK

07:05.025 --> 07:06.494
AND ALL THE PRACTICES.

07:06.527 --> 07:07.995
THINK OF ALL THE ORANGE SLICES
YOU'VE DONE.

07:08.028 --> 07:09.963
SO MANY FREAKIN' ORANGES.
ORANGE SLICES. SO MUCH.

07:09.997 --> 07:12.800
OH, MY GOD, CAN THEY TOSS
THE PEELS INTO THE GARBAGE CAN

07:12.833 --> 07:14.301
THAT'S JUST 3 FEET AWAY?
NO.

07:14.334 --> 07:16.003
NO. NO. YOU WANNA KNOW WHY?
BECAUSE THEY'RE SOCCER PLAYERS.

07:16.036 --> 07:17.971
THEY CAN'T USE THEIR HANDS.

07:18.005 --> 07:21.174
SO... YOU CAN'T WASTE
ALL THAT EFFORT, RIGHT?

07:21.208 --> 07:23.110
OH, SURE, I CAN.
YOU JUST CONVINCED ME.

07:23.143 --> 07:25.979
IF I NEVER HAVE TO WASH ANOTHER
SWEATY SOCCER SOCK AGAIN...

07:26.013 --> 07:30.350
YEAH, BUT, HONEY, WHAT IF EVE
IS DESTINED FOR THE OLYMPICS?

07:30.383 --> 07:33.854
MIKE, SHE'S NOT.

07:33.887 --> 07:35.489
WE BOTH WANT TO GO TO RIO--

07:35.523 --> 07:38.959
A CITY WITH A GIANT JESUS
STARING AT 4 MILLION THONGS.

07:38.992 --> 07:41.361
WHAT A CULTURE.

07:43.163 --> 07:46.199
SO... HERE'S ANOTHER REASON
WHY I SHOULD QUIT SOCCER.

07:46.233 --> 07:48.101
IF I'M NOT ALWAYS COVERED
WITH BRUISES,

07:48.135 --> 07:50.971
YOU WON'T GET ALL THOSE
DIRTY LOOKS IN CHURCH.

07:52.205 --> 07:53.674
NICE TRY.

07:53.707 --> 07:55.843
YOUR MOM AND I DISCUSSED IT.
YOU'RE NOT QUITTING.

07:55.876 --> 07:57.177
NO, WE DIDN'T DECIDE THAT.

07:57.210 --> 07:59.179
I DIDN'T SAY WE AGREED.
WE DISCUSSED IT.
NO, YOU DID.

07:59.212 --> 08:01.048
YOU ALWAYS JUST ASSUME
I AGREE WITH YOU.
LOOK, NO, WE HAD A DISCUSSION.

08:01.081 --> 08:02.816
THE WHOLE TIME, THAT'S
WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT.
NO--TALK TO HER.

08:02.850 --> 08:04.985
LISTEN, LISTEN, LISTEN.
HERE, THE POINT IS,

08:05.018 --> 08:06.787
YOU'RE NOT OLD ENOUGH
TO MAKE THIS DECISION.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.355
AND APPARENTLY
NEITHER IS YOUR MOTHER.
OH...

08:08.388 --> 08:09.823
LISTEN...
(speaks indistinctly)

08:09.857 --> 08:12.459
YOU PLAY SOCCER.
YOU'RE REALLY GOOD AT SOCCER.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.394
YOU'RE NOT QUITTING SOCCER.
THAT'S THE END OF STORY.

08:14.427 --> 08:16.329
THAT'S SO UNFAIR.
NOW YOU'RE PUNISHING ME

08:16.363 --> 08:19.166
FOR BEING GOOD AT SOMETHING?
LISTEN, WHEN YOU'RE
CARRYING AN AMERICAN FLAG

08:19.199 --> 08:20.568
INTO THAT OLYMPIC STADIUM

08:20.601 --> 08:22.402
REPRESENTING THE U.S. OLYMPIC
SOCCER TEAM,

08:22.435 --> 08:23.971
YOU'RE GONNA THANK ME
FOR THIS.

08:24.004 --> 08:26.406
OR, BECAUSE MY DAD PUTS
TOO MUCH PRESSURE ON ME,

08:26.439 --> 08:29.843
I'LL BE WORKING THE POLE
AT BOB'S CLASSY LADY!

08:36.116 --> 08:40.220
LIKE THEY'D EVER HIRE A GIRL
WITH AN ATTITUDE LIKE THAT.

08:46.594 --> 08:48.562
HEY, HONEY,
HELP ME OUT HERE.

08:48.596 --> 08:50.163
WHAT DOES
THE BLACK CULTURE THINK

08:50.197 --> 08:51.999
OF MICHAEL JACKSON
THESE DAYS?

08:52.032 --> 08:54.735
GENIUS OR NUT JOB?

08:54.768 --> 08:56.503
MIKE, COME ON.
NOT, I'M NOT KIDDING.
IT MAY COME UP.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.071
I DON'T WANT TO MAKE
A FOOL OF MYSELF.
KNOW WHAT?

08:58.105 --> 08:59.773
YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE ME
FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE

08:59.807 --> 09:02.375
BY BEING A JACKASS,
BUT IT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

09:02.409 --> 09:04.111
I'M NOT CANCELING TONIGHT.

09:04.144 --> 09:06.546
I DON'T WANT YOU TO CANCEL.
I CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS PARTY.

09:06.580 --> 09:10.584
IT'S NOT A PARTY.
IT'S JUST DRINKS. AND CHEESE.

09:10.618 --> 09:12.552
WHICH I HOPE THIS GOES
WITH WHATEVER THEY DRINK.

09:12.586 --> 09:14.588
WELL, WHAT IF THEY BRING,
UH, MALT LIQUOR

09:14.622 --> 09:15.956
IN A BROWN PAPER BAG?

09:15.989 --> 09:18.058
OH, GOOD ONE, JACKASS.
VERY GOOD.

09:18.091 --> 09:20.427
YOU KNOW, GET 'EM ALL
OUT OF YOUR SYSTEM.

09:20.460 --> 09:22.029
GO. JUST GET 'EM OUT.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.597
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU
STILL DOING HERE?

09:23.631 --> 09:24.598
EVE'S GONNA BE LATE
FOR SOCCER.

09:24.632 --> 09:25.799
CAN ONE OF YOU GUYS
PLEASE TAKE HER?

09:25.833 --> 09:26.967
I DON'T WANNA BE LATE
FOR CHOIR

09:27.000 --> 09:28.268
'CAUSE I'M AUDITIONING
FOR A SOLO.

09:28.301 --> 09:29.737
EVE, GET YOUR BUTT DOWN HERE.
COME ON, LET'S GO.

09:29.770 --> 09:31.939
COME ON.
YEAH, I'M EXCITED
ABOUT IT, TOO.

09:31.972 --> 09:34.241
MAYBE I'LL GET LUCKY
AND BLOW OUT MY KNEE

09:34.274 --> 09:35.943
AND THEN BE OUT
FOR THE SEASON.

09:35.976 --> 09:38.912
(doorbell rings)
WELL, THAT'S THE SPIRIT.

09:38.946 --> 09:40.413
HI!
OH, HELLO. HI.

09:40.447 --> 09:42.049
COME ON IN.
THIS IS MY HUSBAND MIKE.
OH.

09:42.082 --> 09:44.084
I'M CAROL.
GOOD TO--GOOD TO SEE YOU.

09:44.117 --> 09:45.953
YES, NICE TO MEET YOU.
MIKE BAXTER.

09:45.986 --> 09:47.587
YES. OH, THIS IS FOR YOU.

09:47.621 --> 09:49.389
WOW.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.124
UH...

09:51.158 --> 09:54.394
I'LL JUST--I'LL--I'LL PUT IT
IN THE REFRIGERATOR FOR YOU.

09:54.427 --> 09:56.063
OH. I DON'T KNOW
WHY YOU WOULD.

09:56.096 --> 09:58.231
IT'S A CANDLE.

09:58.265 --> 10:01.168
(laughs) OH.
OH, YES, YES, IT I--

10:01.201 --> 10:04.171
OH, THANK YOU, CAROL.
WOW, YEAH. IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

10:04.204 --> 10:06.139
THANK YOU.
(Carol) WHAT A NICE HOME.

10:06.173 --> 10:07.975
IT'S BASICALLY THE SAME
LAYOUT AS OURS,

10:08.008 --> 10:09.810
ONLY I THINK YOURS
IS A LITTLE BIGGER.

10:09.843 --> 10:12.813
OH, NO, THEY'RE THE SAME.
THEY'RE--THEY'RE EQUAL.

10:15.182 --> 10:17.550
EXCEPT OURS
IS CLEARLY BIGGER.

10:19.119 --> 10:20.688
WELL, YOU NEED THE SPACE.
YEAH.

10:20.721 --> 10:22.856
YEAH.
(laughs) WHERE ARE ALL THOSE
KIDS, ANYWAY?

10:22.890 --> 10:24.925
OH...
WELL, YOU JUST MISSED
MANDY AND EVE,

10:24.958 --> 10:27.961
AND, UH, KRISTIN BROUGHT
OUR GRANDSON TO RYAN'S.

10:27.995 --> 10:29.730
HE'S THE BABY DADDY.

10:34.668 --> 10:37.637
IT--IT'S, UH, A TERM
THAT WE USE

10:37.671 --> 10:41.108
TO DESCRIBE A FATHER
WHO NEVER MARRIED THE MOTHER.

10:41.141 --> 10:43.911
YES. WE'VE HEARD OF THAT.

10:49.216 --> 10:51.952
(piano plays)

10:51.985 --> 10:55.488
OKAY. TAKE FIVE MINUTES,
EVERYBODY.

10:55.522 --> 10:56.990
(cell phone rings)

10:59.326 --> 11:00.828
HELLO?

11:00.861 --> 11:02.662
MANDY, IT'S CAMMY FROM
EVE'S SOCCER TEAM.

11:02.696 --> 11:04.631
THE ONE WITH THE HAIRY LEGS?

11:04.664 --> 11:06.867
NO. THAT'S JEN.
AND I KNOW.

11:06.900 --> 11:09.169
SERIOUSLY,
SHE LOOKS LIKE A CENTAUR.

11:09.202 --> 11:11.038
(laughs)

11:11.071 --> 11:12.806
ANYWAY, WE HAVE A SITUATION.

11:12.840 --> 11:14.207
OKAY. IS EVE OKAY?

11:14.241 --> 11:16.076
KIND OF.

11:16.109 --> 11:18.478
WE BLEW OFF PRACTICE
AND WENT TO TAYLOR'S PARTY.

11:18.511 --> 11:21.882
EVE HAD THREE
TEQUILA POPPERS.

11:21.915 --> 11:23.083
EVE DOESN'T DRINK.

11:23.116 --> 11:25.753
YOU'RE TELLING ME.
SHE'S TERRIBLE AT IT.

11:27.855 --> 11:29.656
MY PARENTS ARE GONNA BE HOME
IN AN HOUR,

11:29.689 --> 11:31.058
AND SHE'S HAMMERED!

11:31.091 --> 11:32.926
OKAY. THIS IS WHAT YOU DO.
GET HER ON HER FEET,

11:32.960 --> 11:35.062
TAKE HER INTO THE BATHROOM.
WHY?

11:35.095 --> 11:36.196
BECAUSE IN FIVE MINUTES,

11:36.229 --> 11:37.865
SOMETHING IS COMING OUT
OF SOMEWHERE,

11:37.898 --> 11:39.432
AND IT'S GOOD TO BE ON TILE.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.674
NO, WE NEVER GET
TO THE MOVIES.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.709
YEAH. HARDLY EVER.
HERE YOU GO.

11:49.743 --> 11:51.078
THANK YOU.

11:51.111 --> 11:53.046
LAST MOVIE SHE DRAGGED ME TO
WAS "THE HELP."

11:55.482 --> 11:57.184
I WAS YELLING THAT ALL THE WAY
THROUGH THAT THEATER--

11:57.217 --> 11:59.086
"HELP! HELP! HELP!"
OH, STOP.

11:59.119 --> 12:01.088
I LOVED IT.

12:01.121 --> 12:03.256
ME, TOO.
HOW THAT PRETTY WHITE GIRL

12:03.290 --> 12:07.060
STARTS THE WHOLE
CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT...

12:07.094 --> 12:09.930
VERY INSPIRATIONAL.

12:13.133 --> 12:15.969
IT'S A SHAME, UH,
NONE OF YOUR DAUGHTERS ARE HERE.

12:16.003 --> 12:17.570
I WANTED TO MEET THEM.

12:17.604 --> 12:20.140
WELL, WE'RE HAVING A-A REAL
PROBLEM WITH OUR YOUNG ONE.

12:20.173 --> 12:21.775
SHE'S A SOCCER PLAYER--
GOOD ONE--

12:21.809 --> 12:23.076
AND SHE WANTS
TO QUIT SOCCER.

12:23.110 --> 12:24.945
OH, WE WENT THROUGH
THE SAME THING WITH OUR SON.

12:24.978 --> 12:26.780
YEAH?
HE GOT BURNED OUT ON SPORTS,

12:26.814 --> 12:28.281
BUT WE DECIDED
WE WEREN'T GONNA FORCE HIM.

12:28.315 --> 12:30.483
OH, SEE, NOW I THINK
YOU DID THE RIGHT THING, CHUCK.

12:30.517 --> 12:32.152
WRONG, WRONG, WRONG,
WRONG, WRONG.
YEAH. NO. NO WHY?

12:32.185 --> 12:34.487
I-IT'S A BAD LESSON.
WHEN KIDS ARE GOOD,

12:34.521 --> 12:36.957
THEN YOU DON'T WANT THEM TO STOP
DOING IT. IT MAKES THEM LAZY.

12:36.990 --> 12:39.492
I'M SURE THEIR KID
ISN'T LAZY.

12:39.526 --> 12:41.328
WELL, IT WORKED WITH OUR SON.

12:41.361 --> 12:43.496
HE THOUGHT ABOUT IT,
WENT BACK ON HIS OWN.

12:43.530 --> 12:45.665
NOW HE LEADS THE TEAM
IN SCORING.

12:45.698 --> 12:47.767
WHAT'S HE DOING,
20, 25 POINTS A GAME?

12:47.801 --> 12:50.270
MORE LIKE 2.
HE PLAYS WATER POLO.

12:53.640 --> 12:55.108
WATER POLO?

12:55.142 --> 12:58.545
YEP. HE CAN SWIM.

13:02.549 --> 13:05.085
DOES THAT SURPRISE YOU?

13:05.118 --> 13:08.155
UH, NO. NO.
WE'RE NOT SURPRISED.

13:08.188 --> 13:10.991
MIKE, HOW--HOW COULD YOU ASSUME
THEIR KID PLAYS BASKETBALL?

13:11.024 --> 13:14.161
WHY WOULD I ASSUME
HE PLAYS WATER POLO?

13:14.194 --> 13:17.030
NO, IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.

13:17.064 --> 13:18.498
CHUCK'S JUST MESSING
WITH YOU.
OH...

13:18.531 --> 13:20.133
OUR SON DOES PLAY
BASKETBALL.
OH.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.536
(laughs) AND HE SWIMS
LIKE A ROCK.

13:23.570 --> 13:25.172
(laughs)

13:27.140 --> 13:29.476
AH, I MEAN, I'M SURE
HE--HE SWIMS JUST AS WELL

13:29.509 --> 13:31.979
AS ANY OTHER KIND OF KID.
YEAH.

13:32.012 --> 13:34.047
HONEY, STOP IT.
WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?

13:34.081 --> 13:36.316
WE'RE JUST--WE'RE HAVING
A PLEASANT CONVERSATION

13:36.349 --> 13:37.951
WITH OUR NEW FRIENDS
THE LARABEES.

13:37.985 --> 13:39.119
HEY, CHUCK, DOES THIS
FEEL PLEASANT TO YOU?

13:39.152 --> 13:42.322
I ACTUALLY FEEL
RATHER TENSE.

13:42.355 --> 13:46.459
BECAUSE THIS IS
INSANELY AWKWARD.

13:46.493 --> 13:49.162
OH, COME ON. C--STOP
KIDDING AROUND, YOU TWO.

13:49.196 --> 13:51.131
COME ON. CAROL AND I ARE
GETTING ALONG REALLY WELL.

13:51.164 --> 13:54.467
(laughs) I WOULDN'T SAY
REALLY WELL.
(Mike chuckles)

13:54.501 --> 13:56.003
LISTEN, MY WIFE'S
A LOVELY WOMAN,

13:56.036 --> 13:57.170
AND THE REASON THAT
SHE INVITED YOU HERE

13:57.204 --> 13:58.671
IS 'CAUSE SHE FELT GUILTY
YOU MIGHT THINK

13:58.705 --> 14:00.407
THAT THAT EGGING WAS
RACIALLY MOTIVATED.

14:00.440 --> 14:03.043
I DON'T THINK THE KLAN
DOES A LOT OF WORK WITH EGGS.

14:03.076 --> 14:04.644
HA! YOU KNOW, I...

14:04.677 --> 14:07.847
(speaking indistinctly)

14:09.349 --> 14:12.052
WE ONLY CAME BECAUSE VANESSA
KINDA PUT US ON THE SPOT.

14:12.085 --> 14:13.353
YEAH, AND WE THOUGHT
IF WE SAID NO,

14:13.386 --> 14:15.989
SHE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT THAT
WAS RACIALLY MOTIVATED.

14:16.023 --> 14:19.192
SO, W-W-W-WAIT, THIS IS GREAT.
NO ONE WANTS TO BE HERE!

14:20.760 --> 14:23.063
I WANT TO BE HERE.
OH, COME ON, LET IT GO.

14:23.096 --> 14:24.564
JUST BECAUSE WE LIVE
NEAR EACH OTHER

14:24.597 --> 14:26.166
DOESN'T MEAN
WE GOTTA BE FRIENDS.

14:26.199 --> 14:28.268
YEAH. YOU SEE, WHY DO WE HAVE
TO BE NEIGHBORLY WITH NEIGHBORS?

14:28.301 --> 14:30.270
EXACTLY.
I DON'T NEED SOME CLOWN

14:30.303 --> 14:32.772
BORROWING MY GARDEN HOSE
ONLY TO NEVER SEE IT AGAIN

14:32.805 --> 14:34.874
EXCEPT WHEN HE'S WATERING
HIS LAWN WITH IT!

14:34.908 --> 14:36.243
LISTEN TO THIS. LET'S SAY
YOU WANT TO COME OVER

14:36.276 --> 14:37.577
AND BORROW MY LAWN MOWER.
RIGHT.

14:37.610 --> 14:39.012
MAYBE I JUST DON'T WANT
TO LOAN IT TO YOU.

14:39.046 --> 14:40.713
BUT YOU THINK I DON'T
LOAN IT TO YOU

14:40.747 --> 14:42.182
'CAUSE YOU'RE BLACK AND I'M
AFRAID YOU'RE GONNA STEAL IT.

14:42.215 --> 14:43.951
SEE--I'M NOT THAT PARANOID.

14:43.984 --> 14:45.418
EXACTLY! BUT YOU SHOULD BE,

14:45.452 --> 14:48.956
'CAUSE THAT'S PROBABLY
WHAT I'D BE THINKING!
(laughs)

14:48.989 --> 14:51.891
WELL, I'M GLAD
THAT'S SETTLED! YEAH!
YEAH! OKAY!

14:51.925 --> 14:54.527
WHOO!
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS IS ALL RIGHT.

14:54.561 --> 14:57.130
I'LL TELL YOU RIGHT NOW,
IF YOUR HOUSE WAS ON FIRE,

14:57.164 --> 14:59.132
I WOULD CALL
THE FIRE DEPARTMENT.

14:59.166 --> 15:01.134
AND IF SOMEONE WAS
BREAKING INTO YOUR HOUSE,

15:01.168 --> 15:02.902
I'D CALL THE POLICE.

15:02.936 --> 15:05.372
EXCEPT IF IT'S A WHITE GUY.
THEN YOU GO AHEAD AND SHOOT HIM.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.941
(laughs) WHAT ARE THE ODDS?

15:07.975 --> 15:10.477
(laughing)

15:10.510 --> 15:12.379
(mouths words)

15:12.412 --> 15:14.314
(sighs)

15:14.347 --> 15:16.049
ARE YOU SURE YOU GUYS
DON'T WANT TO TAKE HOME

15:16.083 --> 15:18.285
SOME OF THESE APPETIZERS,
TAKE HOME THE CRACKERS?

15:18.318 --> 15:20.988
NO, WE'LL JUST LEAVE
YOU FOLKS HERE.

15:21.021 --> 15:22.689
(laughs)

15:23.991 --> 15:26.393
COME ON,
IT'S A CRACKER JOKE.

15:32.099 --> 15:33.733
(knock on door)

15:33.766 --> 15:35.302
THANKS FOR COMING, MANDY.
NO TIME.
I DO THE TALKING.

15:35.335 --> 15:37.304
CAN SHE WALK ON HER OWN?
I THINK SO.

15:37.337 --> 15:38.972
WHAT'S THE E.T.A.
ON YOUR PARENTS?

15:39.006 --> 15:41.108
15 MINUTES.
WE HAVE TO WORK FAST.

15:43.543 --> 15:44.811
WOW!

15:44.844 --> 15:47.114
MOUTHWASH? EYE DROPS?
TOWELETTES?

15:47.147 --> 15:49.582
CLEAN URINE?

15:49.616 --> 15:52.986
I'VE SEEN THINGS
YOU CAN'T UNSEE.

15:53.020 --> 15:55.088
CAMMY, YOU JUST WASTED
11 SECONDS

15:55.122 --> 15:57.090
YOU COULD'VE SPENT
MAKING EVE A CUP OF COFFEE--

15:57.124 --> 16:00.093
LOTS OF CREAM, LOTS OF SUGAR.
IS THIS WATER?
YES.

16:00.127 --> 16:01.861
(gasps)

16:01.894 --> 16:03.596
COME ON, EVE! WORK WITH ME!
(groaning)

16:03.630 --> 16:05.165
WE GOTTA GET YOU BACK
INTO YOUR SOCCER UNIFORM.

16:05.198 --> 16:08.135
UP, UP, UP! YOU DID NOT
DITCH SOCCER TONIGHT.
(continues groaning)

16:08.168 --> 16:10.170
YOU WENT TO PRACTICE.
SAY IT!

16:10.203 --> 16:12.005
(whining) I WENT
TO PRACTICE TONIGHT.

16:12.039 --> 16:13.040
SIT DOWN.
(cries)

16:13.073 --> 16:15.275
THIS IS ALL DAD'S FAULT
FOR FORCING ME

16:15.308 --> 16:17.610
TO STAY ON THE SOCCER TEAM.

16:17.644 --> 16:20.047
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW HARD
IT IS TO HAVE DAD THINK

16:20.080 --> 16:22.749
YOU'RE SO GREAT
AT SOMETHING.

16:24.884 --> 16:26.186
YEAH, THAT MUST SUCK.

16:28.688 --> 16:30.723
(gasps)

16:30.757 --> 16:34.227
(choking and sobbing)
I'M AWAKE!

16:34.261 --> 16:36.329
GOOD. NOW WE HAVE TO
MAKE IT LOOK

16:36.363 --> 16:38.065
LIKE YOU'VE BEEN
PLAYING SOCCER,

16:38.098 --> 16:39.999
SO I'M GONNA HAVE TO ROLL YOU
AROUND ON THE LAWN A LITTLE BIT.

16:43.836 --> 16:45.505
YOU KNOW, I ACTUALLY HAD
A GOOD TIME TONIGHT.

16:45.538 --> 16:48.641
AS NEIGHBORS GO,
I'D HANG OUT WITH CHUCK.

16:48.675 --> 16:50.177
BETTER THAN THAT GUY
ACROSS THE STREET FROM HIM

16:50.210 --> 16:52.812
WHOSE MAILBOX LOOKS LIKE
A LITTLE VERSION OF HIS HOUSE.

16:52.845 --> 16:54.981
WHAT A PUTZ!

16:55.014 --> 16:57.884
WELL, MAYBE I SHOULD INVITE
THE LARABEES OVER FOR DINNER.

16:57.917 --> 16:59.719
WHO ARE THE LARABEES?

16:59.752 --> 17:01.954
(mouths words)

17:05.792 --> 17:07.694
OKAY, THEY'RE IN THE KITCHEN.

17:07.727 --> 17:09.162
I'M GONNA KEEP THEM
DISTRACTED.

17:09.196 --> 17:10.997
ALL YOU NEED TO DO
IS GO UPSTAIRS

17:11.030 --> 17:12.165
AND GO TO BED, OKAY?

17:12.199 --> 17:13.933
OKAY.

17:17.137 --> 17:18.605
HI!

17:18.638 --> 17:19.906
WHERE ARE YOU RUNNING OFF TO?

17:19.939 --> 17:21.274
GUYS, I WANNA TELL YOU
ABOUT CHOIR!

17:21.308 --> 17:23.076
GUESS WHAT? GUESS WHAT?
I GOT A SOLO!

17:23.110 --> 17:24.344
GOOD!
OH, THAT'S GREAT, HONEY.

17:24.377 --> 17:25.378
YEAH!
GOOD!

17:25.412 --> 17:27.013
SO YOU WANNA LET ME
SING IT FOR YOU?

17:27.046 --> 17:28.381
OH, WAIT, WE SHOULD DO IT
IN THE GARAGE.

17:28.415 --> 17:30.450
IT HAS BETTER ACOUSTICS.
YEAH.

17:30.483 --> 17:34.020
(ascending and descending) * MI,
MI, MI, MI, MI, MI, MI, MI, MI *

17:34.053 --> 17:35.388
(body thuds)
* MI, MI, MI, MI, MI,
MI, MI, MI, MI *

17:35.422 --> 17:37.090
WHAT WAS THAT?

17:37.124 --> 17:39.726
UH, ARPEGGIOS.
I'M WARMING UP.

17:39.759 --> 17:42.095
EVE?
HEY, HEY, HEY.
DID YOU FALL DOWN?

17:42.129 --> 17:44.931
I'M FINE, DAD.
JUST GET OUT OF MY ROOM.

17:44.964 --> 17:46.899
HOW MUCH HAS SHE HAD
TO DRINK?

17:46.933 --> 17:48.535
JUST A FEW TEQUILA POPPERS.

17:48.568 --> 17:49.936
TEQUILA? SERIOUSLY?

17:49.969 --> 17:52.105
YOU'RE QUITTING SOCCER,
YOU'RE DRINKING?

17:52.139 --> 17:53.473
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?!

17:55.175 --> 17:57.977
OKAY...

17:58.010 --> 17:59.579
WHAT WAS THE FIRST QUESTION?

17:59.612 --> 18:00.980
UGH.

18:01.013 --> 18:03.216
YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET
ANY ANSWERS OUT OF HER TONIGHT.

18:03.250 --> 18:04.784
WE'LL DEAL WITH THIS
TOMORROW MORNING.

18:04.817 --> 18:06.153
YEAH. YOUR ROOM'S
GONNA BE SPINNING A BIT,

18:06.186 --> 18:07.587
BUT IT'LL SLOW DOWN
BY THE TIME

18:07.620 --> 18:08.988
YOU GET OUT OF THERE
IN FOUR MONTHS!

18:09.021 --> 18:11.090
(Vanessa) COME ON.

18:11.124 --> 18:13.059
YOU TAKE YOUR SISTER OUT
AND YOU GET HER DRUNK?

18:13.092 --> 18:14.093
WHAT? NO!

18:14.127 --> 18:15.628
DON'T LIE TO ME.
I'M NOT LYING!

18:15.662 --> 18:17.997
SHE'S TELLING THE TRUTH, DAD.
SHE WASN'T EVEN THERE.

18:18.030 --> 18:19.666
YOU DON'T NEED TO COVER
FOR YOUR SISTER.

18:19.699 --> 18:20.967
I'M NOT.
SHE'S COVERING FOR ME.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.069
IT WAS ALL MY FAULT.
BATHROOM.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.337
WHAT?

18:24.371 --> 18:27.039
BATHROOM!
BATHROOM! BATHROOM!

18:29.041 --> 18:30.977
YOU SEE? ALL I DID
WAS TRY TO HELP.

18:31.010 --> 18:32.779
(door closes)
SHE'S OBVIOUSLY ACTING OUT
BECAUSE YOU FORCED HER

18:32.812 --> 18:34.414
TO PLAY SOCCER,
AND SHE HATES IT.

18:34.447 --> 18:36.583
I'M NOT IN THE HABIT OF LETTING
MY DAUGHTERS JUST QUIT STUFF

18:36.616 --> 18:39.686
BECAUSE IT GETS TOUGH.
OKAY, WELL, HOW ABOUT
WHEN YOU LET ME QUIT, UH,

18:39.719 --> 18:41.921
SAXOPHONE, DANCE CLASS,
UH, TYPING,

18:41.954 --> 18:44.191
THAT--THAT--THAT THING
WITH THE ICE SKATES?

18:46.193 --> 18:47.594
ICE SKATING.

18:47.627 --> 18:49.162
I WAS GETTING THERE!

18:49.196 --> 18:51.164
YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN ME
LIKE YOU BELIEVE IN EVE,

18:51.198 --> 18:52.999
SO YOU LET ME QUIT STUFF
ALL THE TIME.

18:53.032 --> 18:55.101
YOU COULD QUIT YELLING AT ME.
I'LL LET YOU DO THAT.

18:55.134 --> 18:56.636
EVE SO MUCH AS MENTIONS
QUITTING SOCCER,

18:56.669 --> 18:58.171
AND YOU ACT LIKE
IT'S THE END OF THE WORLD.

18:58.205 --> 19:00.006
BUT I HAD TO LEAVE CHOIR
EARLY TONIGHT

19:00.039 --> 19:02.375
TO GO AND HELP HER,
AND I MIGHT LOSE MY SOLO!

19:02.409 --> 19:04.744
BUT YOU--YOU COULD CARE LESS!

19:13.052 --> 19:15.188
(sighs)

19:17.890 --> 19:19.292
MORNING, HONEY.

19:19.326 --> 19:21.294
(groaning)
MOMMY, I'M SO SICK.

19:21.328 --> 19:23.363
MM. YEAH, I KNOW, I KNOW.

19:23.396 --> 19:25.765
IT'S CALLED A HANGOVER.

19:26.999 --> 19:30.002
IT WAS SO MUCH FUNNIER
IN THAT MOVIE.

19:31.003 --> 19:32.004
(sighs)

19:32.038 --> 19:34.073
HERE. OH. LET GO.
LET GO.
(groans softly)

19:34.106 --> 19:36.976
YOU KNOW WHAT, EVIE?
YOU REALLY LET ME DOWN.

19:37.009 --> 19:40.813
AND I WAS ACTUALLY ON YOUR SIDE
WITH THIS WHOLE SOCCER THING.

19:40.847 --> 19:42.815
REALLY?

19:42.849 --> 19:44.050
DOES THAT MEAN I CAN QUIT?

19:44.083 --> 19:45.918
(chuckles) NO WAY.

19:45.952 --> 19:48.988
UGH!

19:49.021 --> 19:50.590
THIS LITTLE STUNT CONVINCED ME

19:50.623 --> 19:53.726
THAT YOU ARE NOT READY
TO MAKE DECISIONS FOR YOURSELF.

19:53.760 --> 19:55.595
OH, GOOD, YOU'RE STILL
IN YOUR UNIFORM,

19:55.628 --> 19:57.196
'CAUSE YOU GOT A GAME
IN AN HOUR.

19:57.230 --> 19:59.699
BUT I HAVE A HANGOVER.

19:59.732 --> 20:01.868
YEAH, THAT'S GONNA SUCK.

20:03.470 --> 20:06.205
IF YOU NEED ME, I'LL BE
DOWNSTAIRS SLICING ORANGES.

20:06.239 --> 20:09.041
(door slams)
AH!

20:12.745 --> 20:14.347
(bottles rattling)

20:14.381 --> 20:15.882
HMM. SOUNDS LIKE A LOT
OF DEAD SOLDIERS IN THERE.

20:15.915 --> 20:19.552
WAS I A BAD INFLUENCE
ON YOU AND MOM, TOO?

20:19.586 --> 20:22.088
WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT
WAS WAY OUT OF LINE.

20:22.121 --> 20:23.956
DAD, EVE TOLD YOU
IT WASN'T MY FAULT.

20:23.990 --> 20:25.958
I MEANT ME.

20:25.992 --> 20:29.729
I'M CONFUSED. ARE YOU
ADMITTING YOU MADE A MISTAKE?

20:31.931 --> 20:34.133
DON'T GET USED TO IT.
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN AGAIN.

20:34.967 --> 20:36.736
HONEY, I REALLY
APPRECIATE YOU

20:36.769 --> 20:37.970
TRYING TO HELP
YOUR SISTER LAST NIGHT.

20:38.004 --> 20:40.473
WELL, YOU KNOW, WE ALL
HAVE TO BE THERE FOR EVE.

20:40.507 --> 20:42.141
I ASSUME YOU GUYS
JUST KEEP ME AROUND

20:42.174 --> 20:44.944
IN CASE SHE NEEDS
A KIDNEY.

20:44.977 --> 20:47.314
LISTEN, HONEY,

20:47.347 --> 20:48.981
I BELIEVE IN YOU JUST AS MUCH
AS I BELIEVE IN EVE.

20:49.015 --> 20:50.617
IT'S JUST THAT THE THINGS
YOU'RE GOOD AT

20:50.650 --> 20:52.151
REALLY AREN'T
IN MY WHEELHOUSE.

20:52.184 --> 20:54.321
DO YOU MEAN LIKE BEING BEAUTIFUL
AND SOCIALLY GRACEFUL

20:54.354 --> 20:58.090
AND FASHIONABLE, WITH A KIND OF
RADIANT STAR QUALITY?

20:59.426 --> 21:01.127
YEAH, THAT CRAP.

21:02.595 --> 21:04.063
YOU'RE VERY CONFIDENT,

21:04.096 --> 21:06.966
AND SOMETIMES I FORGET THAT
YOU NEED ENCOURAGEMENT.

21:06.999 --> 21:09.569
YEAH. MAYBE JUST ONCE...
OKAY.

21:09.602 --> 21:12.605
EVERY DAY OR SO, WHEN I DO
SOMETHING ESPECIALLY AMAZING.

21:12.639 --> 21:15.174
WELL, I'M GONNA PUSH YOU
JUST AS HARD AS I DO EVE.

21:15.207 --> 21:16.943
AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA QUIT
THAT SHOW CHOIR.

21:16.976 --> 21:18.945
WHEN DO YOU DO THAT SOLO?
IN A COUPLE MONTHS.

21:18.978 --> 21:21.814
I WILL BE THERE.

21:21.848 --> 21:24.016
UNLESS EVE HAS A SOCCER GAME.

21:24.050 --> 21:25.352
(clicks tongue)
