00:11.052 --> 00:14.222
[dinosaurs bellowing]

00:36.995 --> 00:39.414
[thudding]

00:40.206 --> 00:45.462
[roars, screeches]

00:50.091 --> 00:53.428
-[Darius] We thought it'd be fun.
-[fire crackling]

00:53.511 --> 00:55.764
We thought we'd be safe, but...

00:56.765 --> 01:01.519
we didn't realize the... horror
waiting for us on the island.

01:02.812 --> 01:03.730
Claws...

01:05.190 --> 01:06.149
Teeth...

01:08.234 --> 01:10.153
-Screaming...
-[gasps]

01:10.612 --> 01:13.198
-[Darius] So much screaming.
-How much screaming?

01:13.281 --> 01:16.076
Shh! He's getting to the good part.

01:17.285 --> 01:19.370
The T. rex stalked closer.

01:20.413 --> 01:22.248
Her jaws opened wide.

01:22.957 --> 01:23.833
[camera shutter clicks]

01:25.043 --> 01:26.252
What? Huh?

01:26.795 --> 01:27.837
For the vlog.

01:28.254 --> 01:29.756
Keep telling your little story.

01:30.965 --> 01:32.133
[sighs]

01:33.802 --> 01:35.053
Oh, here we go.

01:38.056 --> 01:39.349
-The T. rex sta--
-[Brooklynn] Dang!

01:39.766 --> 01:42.852
-Ugh!
-Out of space. Wait, I'm sorry, hold on.

01:42.936 --> 01:45.605
I just don't wanna delete
my selfie on Everest, you know?

01:45.688 --> 01:46.564
Ooh!

01:46.648 --> 01:48.775
-Maybe I should start over.
-[Ben] No!

01:48.858 --> 01:50.151
In fact, you can just stop.

01:50.235 --> 01:52.779
Dude, chill. He's not even telling
the story right now.

01:52.862 --> 01:54.656
And how is your grip this strong?

01:55.406 --> 01:56.991
So, the T. rex stalked--

01:57.075 --> 01:58.868
Shouldn't we call Yasmina over?

01:58.952 --> 02:00.870
I bet she'd love this story.

02:02.038 --> 02:03.748
Maybe she wants to be by herself.

02:05.625 --> 02:06.668
I don't understand.

02:06.751 --> 02:10.755
You know how sometimes
people just wanna be left alone?

02:12.590 --> 02:15.927
[chuckles] Kenji, you're hilarious.

02:16.010 --> 02:18.763
I think she's just shy and doesn't know
how to make camp friends.

02:18.847 --> 02:20.640
-[thunder crashes]
-[gasps, whimpers]

02:21.975 --> 02:24.811
-[all gasping, screaming]
-Maybe we should go inside.

02:24.894 --> 02:26.146
[Ben] Way ahead of you!

02:26.896 --> 02:27.939
-Hurry!
-[Kenji] Aw, man!

02:28.022 --> 02:29.732
[Sammy] Oh, it's coming down fast.

02:29.941 --> 02:31.860
[Brooklynn] Well,
that was a waste of time.

02:32.235 --> 02:33.319
[scoffs]

02:33.403 --> 02:34.779
Thanks, Brooklynn.

02:39.617 --> 02:41.202
[thunder crashes]

02:41.744 --> 02:44.956
Darius, it wasn't that great of a story.
I wasn't engrossed or anything.

02:45.039 --> 02:47.625
[Brooklynn] Just don't touch my phone.
How does that sound?

02:47.709 --> 02:49.377
[Kenji] Let's decide this
with a game of foose.

02:49.460 --> 02:50.795
Oh, my pages got wet.

02:50.879 --> 02:53.172
-You need a friend!
-[yelps] What?

02:53.256 --> 02:54.465
I'm such a ding-dong!

02:54.549 --> 02:57.844
You're alone. And when I feel alone,
having a friend around sure is nice.

02:57.927 --> 02:59.888
I could use a friend,
and you probably could, too.

02:59.971 --> 03:03.391
So I thought, "Yasmina needs someone
to make the first friendship move,"

03:03.474 --> 03:04.976
so, here I am!

03:05.310 --> 03:07.604
Um, I lost you around "ding-dong."

03:07.687 --> 03:09.689
[gasps] Is that a scrapbook?

03:09.772 --> 03:11.274
I love scrapbooking.

03:11.357 --> 03:14.193
We can make one together.
Pull you out of your shell.

03:14.277 --> 03:16.529
I'm pretty happy in my shell.

03:16.821 --> 03:20.325
No one likes the shell.
It stops people from getting to know you.

03:20.408 --> 03:21.326
Bingo!

03:23.036 --> 03:26.956
-I know you're just shy!
-Can't hear you in my shell!

03:30.793 --> 03:31.711
[low growl]

03:31.794 --> 03:35.006
-[Darius] Yes!
-[Sammy] This is gonna be so much fun!

03:35.381 --> 03:36.466
[Ben] Oh, man! I'm driving.

03:36.758 --> 03:40.178
We get to drive gyrospheres? Cool!

03:40.261 --> 03:42.013
Saddle up, dudes and dudettes.

03:42.096 --> 03:44.974
We're going on a cattle drive,
but with dinosaurs!

03:45.058 --> 03:46.601
It's a dino drive!

03:46.684 --> 03:51.397
And just to be clear,
all these dinosaurs are herbivores, right?

03:51.481 --> 03:54.609
Well, they only chewed
on the last kid a little,

03:54.692 --> 03:57.862
so we're, like, 99 percent sure
they're cool.

03:57.946 --> 03:59.239
[whimpers]

03:59.322 --> 04:01.407
Park personnel are moving
a group of dinosaurs

04:01.491 --> 04:03.910
to fresh grazing lands across the island,

04:04.077 --> 04:06.537
and we get to ride along behind the herd.

04:06.621 --> 04:11.084
Are you kidding me?
Dinosaur migration patterns are my jam!

04:11.167 --> 04:13.544
You may wanna consider a new jam, bro.

04:14.003 --> 04:16.297
So, uh, you sure these things
are waterproof?

04:16.381 --> 04:21.219
Looking pretty grim out here
and hair this awesome does not come easy.

04:21.302 --> 04:23.680
Your hair is gonna be fine, Kenji.

04:23.763 --> 04:26.266
Storm has already moved
up the coast away from us.

04:26.391 --> 04:29.769
Cool! Time to show these fools
what a gyrosphere master can do.

04:29.852 --> 04:30.937
[Roxie] No way!

04:31.020 --> 04:34.065
You are riding with Ben,
as a passenger.

04:34.148 --> 04:37.235
But-- Seriously? But he's so, uh...

04:38.152 --> 04:39.487
Whoa! [grunts]

04:40.446 --> 04:43.199
-Live it up, tough guy.
-[groans]

04:47.078 --> 04:49.038
This is gonna be so sick.

04:49.122 --> 04:49.998
Right?

04:50.581 --> 04:52.500
Now we're in a shell together.

04:52.583 --> 04:54.127
A shell for two.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.337
Yay.

04:56.546 --> 05:00.133
Everyone, seat belts at all times.

05:00.341 --> 05:01.926
Well, what you waiting for, bud?

05:02.093 --> 05:06.139
Right. Um, is there a gyrosphere
I could drive solo or--

05:06.889 --> 05:10.476
Darius, you need to ride
with your fellow campers.

05:10.560 --> 05:13.104
Bond, live the camp life,
share your story, man.

05:13.855 --> 05:16.190
Yeah, I tried last night, but, um...

05:16.858 --> 05:18.276
not everyone was on board.

05:18.359 --> 05:19.485
Buddy, you can't give up.

05:19.777 --> 05:22.989
You need to get out there and you show
those other kids what you got.

05:23.072 --> 05:24.407
Be yourself, Darius.

05:24.490 --> 05:28.870
Teenagers can be very accepting
if you just give them half a chance.

05:30.496 --> 05:32.457
Do they not have teenagers in England?

05:36.544 --> 05:38.671
[inhales, exhales]

05:40.465 --> 05:45.303
Hey, Brooklynn. Are you as stoked as I am
for our gyrosphere adventure?

05:45.386 --> 05:47.430
Sure, whatevs.

05:47.764 --> 05:50.600
[door hisses]

05:51.309 --> 05:53.394
All righty, campers.

05:53.728 --> 05:57.398
The headsets are for emergencies.
You can always reach us on channel six.

05:57.482 --> 05:59.984
Let the herding begin!

06:00.068 --> 06:01.944
-[Sammy] Whoo! See ya!
-[Kenji] Yes!

06:02.320 --> 06:03.863
[crashes]

06:06.741 --> 06:10.870
Okay, now.
Uh, slow and steady wins the race.

06:11.537 --> 06:13.623
Huh! I'm really getting the hang of this!

06:30.473 --> 06:32.183
[bellows]

06:32.266 --> 06:33.559
Are you seeing this?

06:35.144 --> 06:36.270
Whoa!

06:37.605 --> 06:40.775
What's your favorite color? Favorite food?
Favorite color of food?

06:40.858 --> 06:43.236
-Orange, orange, and orange.
-[laughs]

06:43.319 --> 06:44.821
Jokes. I love jokes.

06:44.904 --> 06:46.864
Ooh, what do you
and your friends do for fun?

06:47.281 --> 06:49.283
I train... alone...

06:49.534 --> 06:50.535
quietly.

06:50.785 --> 06:52.370
Really? Dang!

06:52.453 --> 06:54.580
I'm used to people all around 24-7.

06:54.664 --> 06:57.875
My sisters, Daddy, Mama,
Abuela, the cattle. [chuckles]

06:57.959 --> 07:01.671
My mom says I have a knack for dealing
with critters, and that in-- Whoa!

07:02.296 --> 07:03.172
[exhales]

07:03.589 --> 07:05.258
How awesome is this?

07:05.591 --> 07:07.718
We're, like, so close!

07:08.094 --> 07:08.928
Brooklynn?

07:09.512 --> 07:11.055
[Brooklynn] "Used to be cool"?

07:11.139 --> 07:13.182
"You made Jurassic World boring"?

07:13.474 --> 07:15.143
"Lame." "Lame."

07:15.476 --> 07:17.728
"No one likes you anymore."

07:18.438 --> 07:21.566
Uh, hey, can you believe
that an ankylosaurus' tail

07:21.649 --> 07:23.067
is strong enough to shatter bone?

07:23.359 --> 07:25.403
Can you believe I don't care?

07:32.618 --> 07:34.912
[sighs] I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

07:34.996 --> 07:38.291
I-- I'm just... having one of those days.

07:40.960 --> 07:44.005
There's a lot of pressure when
your whole life is about being popular,

07:44.088 --> 07:45.339
and I'm not like you.

07:45.423 --> 07:48.009
I can't just tell a lame story
and move on.

07:48.718 --> 07:49.969
It wasn't that lame.

07:50.052 --> 07:54.640
Trust me, it was.
It totally was, but you're not even fazed.

07:55.183 --> 07:58.728
I just need people to... to like m--

08:01.939 --> 08:04.025
You wouldn't understand.

08:04.817 --> 08:06.986
[Kenji] Of course I don't understand,

08:07.069 --> 08:10.406
'cause you are literally
the worst driver I've ever seen, bruh.

08:10.490 --> 08:14.535
If by "worst" you mean "safest,"
then, yes, yes, I am.

08:14.869 --> 08:16.329
So not a compliment.

08:16.412 --> 08:21.042
Now, come on. Faster, faster, faster!
[groans]

08:21.751 --> 08:23.461
[thunder rumbles]

08:24.337 --> 08:26.631
I thought you said
the storm rolled up the coast.

08:26.714 --> 08:29.050
Oh, it must have rolled back down.
It's okay.

08:29.133 --> 08:32.970
Other than mussing up Kenji's hair,
what's the worst that could happen?

08:33.054 --> 08:34.013
[thunder crashes]

08:34.347 --> 08:36.182
[bellows]

08:36.682 --> 08:39.477
-[growls]
-[bellows]

08:47.360 --> 08:49.070
Hey, gang, new plan.

08:49.153 --> 08:53.032
Storm's getting worse,
so we're all going back to camp.

08:53.115 --> 08:54.325
Fun, right?

08:54.408 --> 08:56.035
-Aw, man!
-Are you serious?

08:56.244 --> 08:58.037
Don't blame me. Blame the storm.

08:58.120 --> 08:59.413
I blame them both.

08:59.497 --> 09:02.542
[Darius] We're not gonna let a little rain
stop us, are we?

09:02.625 --> 09:06.128
When else will we get the chance
to ride alongside a herd of dinosaurs?

09:06.212 --> 09:07.338
Sorry, can't risk it.

09:07.421 --> 09:10.841
But, Dave, I'm sure under you and Roxie's
capable leadership, we'll--

09:10.925 --> 09:13.386
-This is not up for discussion.
-[static crackles]

09:13.469 --> 09:15.513
Hello, hello! Roxie here.

09:15.596 --> 09:17.139
Can you hear me? Anyone?

09:17.431 --> 09:19.433
-[static crackles]
-[indistinct chatter]

09:20.726 --> 09:22.603
Okay, new, new plan.

09:22.687 --> 09:24.397
Storm's interfering with the radio,

09:24.480 --> 09:27.483
so Rox and I will drive ahead
and tell the others we're pulling out.

09:27.567 --> 09:31.612
We'll be right back.
Stay together and stay behind the herd.

09:37.493 --> 09:39.120
[thunder crashes]

09:39.829 --> 09:42.164
[bellows]

09:46.419 --> 09:49.547
That sinoceratops is gonna get lost.
We need to go after her.

09:49.630 --> 09:52.049
You heard Dave.
Let's just chill out and wait here.

09:52.133 --> 09:54.427
I've read everything
about sinoceratops' behavior.

09:54.510 --> 09:55.595
We can get her.

09:55.845 --> 09:59.682
Plus, your followers might really love
a thrilling dino-chase.

10:03.561 --> 10:05.146
[Darius chuckles]

10:06.272 --> 10:08.065
Wait. Are you guys going after her?

10:08.149 --> 10:10.359
I really don't think that's a good idea.

10:10.443 --> 10:12.945
-I've seen cattle spook before, and--
-Uh-huh. Let's go.

10:13.738 --> 10:15.156
[Sammy] Wait, why are we following them?

10:16.532 --> 10:19.327
-Oh, no! There's no way I'm--
-Great! I'll drive.

10:21.871 --> 10:23.080
[roars]

10:27.710 --> 10:29.795
Almost got you, girl.

10:33.841 --> 10:34.884
[both gasp]

10:35.551 --> 10:36.385
[Darius grunts]

10:37.553 --> 10:39.305
Whoa, whoa! Whew!

10:39.388 --> 10:41.182
Sorry. That was close.

10:44.477 --> 10:46.729
Voilà! Instant phone mount.

10:46.812 --> 10:49.732
Great idea. And also, ew.

10:49.815 --> 10:53.527
-Well, just keep driving, dino-nerd.
-Sure thing, superstar.

10:53.611 --> 10:54.445
[Brooklynn giggles]

10:56.155 --> 10:57.239
[sinoceratops bellows]

10:58.115 --> 11:01.118
Um, let's just everybody settle down
a bit.

11:01.202 --> 11:03.412
-We don't wanna get too close or--
-[both scream]

11:03.537 --> 11:05.414
Watch it, Ben. You almost hit us!

11:05.623 --> 11:06.791
It wasn't me!

11:06.999 --> 11:10.711
-You're gonna get us both killed!
-With you driving, we'll die of boredom.

11:10.795 --> 11:13.005
-Give me! [grunts]
-Just-- Give me... [grunts]

11:13.089 --> 11:16.092
-Bro!
-Come on, Darius, get closer!

11:16.342 --> 11:19.011
Someone flank her on the other side
and we can lead her back to the herd.

11:19.095 --> 11:20.388
Wait, you'll scare her. Ah!

11:20.471 --> 11:22.431
Let the big dogs handle this, cowgirl.

11:22.681 --> 11:25.184
Sino sandwich, baby! Hoo!

11:26.394 --> 11:27.895
[growls]

11:28.312 --> 11:29.897
[giggling]

11:29.980 --> 11:32.483
I'll cut her off. It'll be fine, Sammy.

11:32.566 --> 11:34.402
No, he's gonna make her bolt.

11:34.485 --> 11:37.863
This isn't the way to do this.
We gotta calm her down.

11:38.864 --> 11:40.282
[bellows]

11:42.410 --> 11:45.871
Listen up, y'all. We gotta get her
before she goes and spooks the whole herd.

11:45.955 --> 11:47.665
-Stay to the outside or--
-[Kenji] We've got this.

11:47.748 --> 11:50.209
Relax. Darius knows dinosaurs.

11:52.378 --> 11:53.838
[growls]

11:53.921 --> 11:57.299
[both screaming, grunting]

11:57.383 --> 11:58.634
-[bellows]
-[Brooklynn screams]

11:59.468 --> 12:03.013
-[Darius whimpers]
-[both screaming]

12:03.180 --> 12:05.141
They're disappointed,
but they'll get over it.

12:05.224 --> 12:08.227
-Better safe then...
-[bellows]

12:08.686 --> 12:11.397
We've got multiple assets
straying from the herd. [gasps]

12:11.480 --> 12:12.606
[both] The kids!

12:15.734 --> 12:18.112
-[Roxie] Move!
-[crashes, creaks]

12:18.195 --> 12:19.113
Duck!

12:22.783 --> 12:25.369
[Brooklynn and Darius screaming]

12:28.372 --> 12:31.792
[both panting, screaming]

12:32.376 --> 12:34.128
[Brooklynn screams]

12:34.211 --> 12:36.797
-Watch out!
-This thing's not going fast enough.

12:36.881 --> 12:40.468
-Stego, 12 o'clock! Tail, tail, tail!
-Hang on!

12:40.551 --> 12:42.803
Ah! I wanna go home!

12:43.888 --> 12:44.763
[both scream]

12:44.847 --> 12:46.307
[bellows]

12:49.393 --> 12:51.479
Go, go, go, go, go!

12:55.483 --> 12:58.611
-Low branch coming right at us!
-I see it. Let me concentrate.

12:58.694 --> 12:59.612
[thunder crashes]

13:05.534 --> 13:08.412
-[Sammy whimpers]
-[both panting]

13:08.496 --> 13:11.373
Are we... alive? [sighs]

13:13.667 --> 13:14.960
[Kenji screams, grunts]

13:15.044 --> 13:16.504
Left! Back to right!

13:16.587 --> 13:18.172
[grunts] Right! Back to left!

13:18.255 --> 13:21.008
Fine, you drive! Just get us out of here!

13:21.091 --> 13:23.344
-Finally! Let me show you how it's--
-[crashes]

13:23.427 --> 13:25.221
[both grunting, screaming]

13:34.396 --> 13:36.357
[both panting]

13:36.440 --> 13:37.691
I think we lost them.

13:37.775 --> 13:39.693
I think we lost everyone.

13:41.445 --> 13:43.197
[gasps] Look!

13:47.243 --> 13:48.160
Okay, think.

13:48.244 --> 13:50.079
Sinoceratops are fast on open ground,

13:50.162 --> 13:52.915
so we just need to corner her,
then we can get her back to the herd.

13:52.998 --> 13:56.210
Great. Here we go!
Another Brooklynn exclusive!

13:56.293 --> 13:58.712
Keep watching,
'cause it's about to get real!

13:58.796 --> 14:00.965
Wait, wait! Brooklynn, wait!

14:03.384 --> 14:05.344
-[sinoceratops bellows]
-[both scream]

14:05.427 --> 14:08.138
[Brooklynn] Too real! Too real! [screams]

14:09.557 --> 14:10.432
Come on! [gasps]

14:10.516 --> 14:12.142
-[bellows]
-[both scream]

14:12.518 --> 14:13.727
[whimpering]

14:13.811 --> 14:15.854
-No! No!
-Whoa!

14:15.938 --> 14:18.148
-[Darius] No! [whimpers]
-No! [screams]

[both panting]

14:34.665 --> 14:37.334
[both chuckling]

14:37.418 --> 14:39.503
-Huh?
-[gasps]

14:39.587 --> 14:41.213
[mud squelching]

14:41.297 --> 14:43.757
[thunder rumbling]

14:48.804 --> 14:52.308
Good news-- this gives us a lot more time
to get to know each other.

14:52.558 --> 14:54.393
We should do that... later.

14:54.476 --> 14:55.686
Much, much later.

14:55.769 --> 14:57.855
-First, we need to--
-[Brooklynn] <i>Help! Can you hear us?</i>

14:58.188 --> 15:00.482
<i>We're stuck... mudhole and we're sinking!</i>

15:00.566 --> 15:01.400
<i>Help!</i>

15:01.692 --> 15:04.570
Brooklynn? Brooklynn, can you hear me?

15:04.695 --> 15:06.071
Where are you?

15:08.699 --> 15:09.575
We gotta find them.

15:10.034 --> 15:12.786
-Brooklynn? Darius?
-Guys!

15:12.870 --> 15:14.246
Can you hear us?

15:14.830 --> 15:16.874
Keep clearing away the b-- No, wait.

15:16.957 --> 15:18.459
Pile it up. Pile it up. All of it.

15:18.542 --> 15:20.753
-Just keep piling. Come on.
-Okay.

15:21.086 --> 15:21.921
[Yasmina] Get that one.

15:22.338 --> 15:23.339
[both grunt]

15:32.348 --> 15:33.223
[Sammy whimpers]

15:33.849 --> 15:35.559
-[grunting]
-[Sammy] We're coming, Brooklynn!

15:35.643 --> 15:38.228
Hello? Hello? Can anybody hear me?

15:38.312 --> 15:41.065
[huffs] Still no sign of-- Ben and Kenji?

15:41.148 --> 15:42.316
[all screaming]

15:49.406 --> 15:51.325
-[grunts]
-No.

15:52.534 --> 15:53.369
[sniffs]

15:56.372 --> 15:59.875
I'm pretty sure we're exceeding
the maximum occupancy in here.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.211
I lost them. It's just static.

16:02.920 --> 16:04.296
[thunder crashes]

16:05.214 --> 16:07.841
-[Darius] Help!
-[Brooklynn] Somebody, please!

16:08.300 --> 16:10.511
I hear them! They're over there!

16:10.594 --> 16:12.137
[Darius] We're in a sinkhole!

16:12.888 --> 16:14.348
[both grunting]

16:17.017 --> 16:19.728
It won't budge.
The mud is jamming the door shut.

16:19.812 --> 16:22.398
-Try driving out again.
-We'll only sink deeper.

16:22.481 --> 16:26.360
Then you think of something,
Mr. Let's-Go-Corner-the-Dinosaur!

16:26.443 --> 16:27.319
[both grunt]

16:31.323 --> 16:33.283
-[Brooklynn] Anybody, help!
-[Darius] Help!

16:33.367 --> 16:34.618
[grunting]

16:34.702 --> 16:35.786
No!

16:36.078 --> 16:37.204
[Darius sighs]

16:37.830 --> 16:41.834
[both panting]

16:47.881 --> 16:49.842
-[Sammy] <i>Brooklynn? Darius?</i>
-[gasps]

16:49.925 --> 16:51.427
Hello? Sammy?

16:51.510 --> 16:54.013
[Sammy] <i>Do you read me?</i>
<i>We're coming to help!</i>

16:56.473 --> 16:57.558
[gasps]

16:57.641 --> 17:00.310
-[both] Help!
-[Brooklynn] Get us out of here!

17:00.769 --> 17:04.064
Roxie! Dave!
We've got a real emergency here!

17:05.941 --> 17:07.568
[grunts] I can't grab ahold of it.

17:07.651 --> 17:09.528
-[both grunting]
-It's too heavy.

17:09.611 --> 17:11.697
[Ben exclaims] It's gonna pull you under!

17:11.822 --> 17:12.948
[both grunt]

17:14.700 --> 17:16.410
[Ben] Uh, guys?

17:17.578 --> 17:20.748
-[growling]
-[whimpers, grunts]

17:22.374 --> 17:26.003
-[bellows]
-[pants]

17:29.798 --> 17:30.758
What if...

17:31.967 --> 17:33.302
I've got an idea.

17:34.762 --> 17:36.096
What are you doing?

17:36.972 --> 17:38.182
What? Wait!

17:38.265 --> 17:40.017
[bellows]

17:41.643 --> 17:43.312
-[roars]
-Ah!

17:46.356 --> 17:48.275
-Hey.
-[groans]

17:48.358 --> 17:49.443
I get it.

17:56.950 --> 17:59.286
It's hard to trust strangers.

17:59.536 --> 18:01.622
It's a scary world out there.

18:01.914 --> 18:02.748
But...

18:03.457 --> 18:06.877
I'll trust you if you trust me.

18:08.837 --> 18:10.506
I'm not gonna hurt you.

18:24.478 --> 18:26.063
-Whoa.
-[Darius] Guys?

18:26.146 --> 18:28.774
[Brooklynn] Real touching and all,
but we're still gonna die!

18:28.857 --> 18:30.275
-[Darius] Help!
-Hurry!

18:34.613 --> 18:35.906
[grunts]

18:39.326 --> 18:40.160
[Brooklynn] Got it!

18:45.290 --> 18:46.291
[muffled scream]

18:46.458 --> 18:48.669
-Hurry, Sammy!
-[grunts] On it!

18:48.836 --> 18:51.463
Come on, girl. Easy.

18:52.297 --> 18:54.466
[low growl]

18:54.550 --> 18:55.634
[Sammy] That's it.

18:56.009 --> 18:57.344
Nice and slow.

18:57.427 --> 19:00.264
Let's go. You've got this.

19:13.110 --> 19:14.236
[grunts]

19:17.906 --> 19:19.074
Hey.

19:19.491 --> 19:20.450
[laughs]

19:20.534 --> 19:22.619
-[all cheering]
-It worked!

19:22.703 --> 19:25.414
Whoo-hoo! [chuckles] All right! All right!

19:25.497 --> 19:26.957
Cowgirl for the win!

19:27.040 --> 19:29.001
-Woot! Woot!
-[vehicle approaching]

19:31.170 --> 19:33.338
[Sammy] Hey, look! It's Dave and Roxie!

19:33.714 --> 19:35.507
-Hey!
-[Ben sighs]

19:35.841 --> 19:37.926
[sinoceratops bellows]

19:42.264 --> 19:45.017
You could have been killed!
What were you thinking?

19:45.100 --> 19:48.562
That we found a lost dinosaur...
and Darius and Brooklynn.

19:48.770 --> 19:51.315
Don't ask me how I did it, but I did it.

19:51.398 --> 19:52.691
-[Brooklynn laughing]
-[Roxie] What?

19:52.774 --> 19:54.526
[Brooklynn] That's the funniest thing
I've heard all day!

19:54.610 --> 19:57.613
-[Yasmina] Your eyes were closed.
-Now stay in your bunks, you hear me?

19:58.655 --> 20:01.116
-[Sammy] Weren't you crying at one point?
-[Kenji] Hey, I helped!

20:01.200 --> 20:04.119
-[Brooklynn] Oh, my gosh, he's serious.
-[Yasmina] Wow, Kenji.

20:15.130 --> 20:16.089
[clears throat]

20:20.844 --> 20:22.888
Uh... [clears throat]

20:23.805 --> 20:24.848
I...

20:26.099 --> 20:27.976
If everyone would have listened to you...

20:28.185 --> 20:32.522
If I had listened,
we wouldn't have had any problems.

20:33.815 --> 20:37.569
I'm not so great at trusting new people.

20:38.946 --> 20:43.951
So, my favorite color is black,
my favorite food is pizza, and...

20:45.244 --> 20:48.121
this is what I was doing before.

20:51.083 --> 20:55.254
I started drawing to kill time
during track meets.

20:55.337 --> 20:59.216
I'm not very good, so you probably...
probably won't even like them.

20:59.758 --> 21:01.218
I don't like them.

21:02.010 --> 21:05.055
I love them!
I knew we were gonna be friends!

21:05.138 --> 21:07.057
Not really a-- a hugger.

21:07.140 --> 21:09.059
You are now!

21:19.528 --> 21:21.405
[Brooklynn] I managed to get
all the mud off,

21:21.822 --> 21:24.992
which is more than I can say
for these fingernails.

21:25.075 --> 21:27.577
Never a dull day
at Camp Cretaceous, right?

21:30.205 --> 21:31.665
Hey, what's up?

21:32.833 --> 21:35.502
I thought I knew everything
about dinosaurs, but...

21:36.378 --> 21:39.381
all I did was mess up today. [sighs]

21:39.464 --> 21:41.258
I... I just wanted...

21:41.550 --> 21:42.926
People to like you?

21:45.971 --> 21:46.930
Yeah.

21:48.807 --> 21:50.475
Guess we have that in common.

21:52.978 --> 21:56.023
Well, tomorrow's a new day.

21:56.315 --> 22:00.235
And, thanks to you, I've got a new video
to show the Brooklanders,

22:00.319 --> 22:03.780
so, um, I'm gonna go edit it and post.
[chuckles]

22:03.864 --> 22:05.574
Later, dino-nerd.

22:06.950 --> 22:09.745
Oh, and then the sino went boom!
And then Brooklynn was like... [screams]

22:09.828 --> 22:12.831
And then Kenji saved the day... again.

22:12.914 --> 22:15.000
Yeah, that's not at all what happened.

22:15.083 --> 22:17.961
-Just making your story better, bruh.
-[chuckles]

22:18.045 --> 22:20.464
[Brooklynn in video] <i>Look that way.</i>
<i>Wait, come over here.</i>

22:21.298 --> 22:23.216
[distorted audio]

22:23.425 --> 22:26.470
[normal audio] <i>Look that way.</i>
<i>Wait, come over here.</i>

22:27.220 --> 22:29.931
<i>Do you guys even know</i>
<i>how to do interviews?</i>

22:30.098 --> 22:32.684
<i>Darius, stand-- No!</i>

22:32.768 --> 22:33.977
<i>Stand to your left.</i>

22:34.603 --> 22:36.229
<i>No, your other left!</i>

22:36.313 --> 22:37.314
What the...?

22:42.444 --> 22:44.946
[theme music playing]
