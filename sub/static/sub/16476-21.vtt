<i>I've never met a man or woman</i>

00:16.892 --> 00:18.625
<i>who, at some point in their lives,</i>

00:18.627 --> 00:20.928
<i>doesn't believe they've dodged a bullet.</i>

00:28.862 --> 00:31.330
<i>Walked out to the edge
of that cliff we call fate,</i>

00:31.332 --> 00:33.116
<i>and then,</i>

00:34.201 --> 00:35.534
<i>for whatever reason...</i>

00:43.677 --> 00:45.110
<i>...decided not to jump.</i>

00:51.518 --> 00:53.719
<i>You know the feeling.</i>

00:54.955 --> 00:56.321
<i>You're about to make</i>

00:56.323 --> 00:59.057
<i>a life-changing mistake,</i>

00:59.059 --> 01:02.227
<i>and then...</i>

01:02.229 --> 01:03.595
<i>You don't.</i>

01:03.597 --> 01:05.530
<i>The only thing
about those bullets you dodge,</i>

01:05.532 --> 01:08.367
<i>is they do keep traveling,
and sometimes,</i>

01:08.369 --> 01:10.669
<i>they come back to hit you
right between the eyes.</i>

01:10.671 --> 01:13.605
So, you just foraging,
or you have a lunch meeting?

01:13.607 --> 01:15.807
Actually, I've had sushi on
the brain for three days.

01:15.809 --> 01:17.376
You know any place good around here?

01:17.378 --> 01:18.510
Nope.

01:18.512 --> 01:21.013
Hey, you know that stuff
isn't cooked, right?

01:21.015 --> 01:22.981
I only mention it because, you know,

01:22.983 --> 01:24.985
they charge you like it's cooked.

01:25.352 --> 01:27.252
Don't you find that morally dubious?

01:27.254 --> 01:29.121
I'm way too hungry to
play straight man to you,

01:29.123 --> 01:31.123
and we got to be back in that
deposition in 45 minutes.

01:31.125 --> 01:34.159
All right, then, so forget about
eating guppies and goldfish

01:34.161 --> 01:35.627
and come have lunch with me.

01:35.629 --> 01:37.329
I'm meeting a bunch of old friends

01:37.331 --> 01:38.897
who'd be thrilled to meet you.

01:38.899 --> 01:40.399
You'd be like a movie star to them.

01:41.335 --> 01:43.368
All right, how far away is this
place, and who are you meeting?

01:43.370 --> 01:44.880
Oh, it's, it's right here.

01:45.139 --> 01:46.304
It's just a bunch of guys I knew

01:46.306 --> 01:48.974
from the D.A.'s office
when I was an A.D.A.

01:49.551 --> 01:50.709
They texted me
out the blue this morning,

01:50.711 --> 01:52.711
and said, Let's have lunch.â

01:52.713 --> 01:54.012
Yeah, Benny, what are you doing?

01:54.014 --> 01:55.519
You're under investigation
from the D.A.'s office.

01:55.521 --> 01:57.816
No, no, no. It's-it's not that, Bull.

01:57.818 --> 01:59.684
Okay? I-I know these guys.

01:59.686 --> 02:01.920
These guys, they're my friends.

02:01.922 --> 02:03.588
And-and maybe they know something.

02:03.590 --> 02:06.902
You know? Maybe... maybe
they could tell me something.

02:09.571 --> 02:13.909
Benny, if you need me to come
to lunch with you, just ask.

02:16.119 --> 02:17.803
Want to come to lunch with me?

02:19.473 --> 02:21.006
- Good to see you, man.
- You, too.

02:21.008 --> 02:24.643
Jason. This right here is Wilson Jessup.

02:24.645 --> 02:28.647
Used to be one of the
toughest NYPD detectives

02:28.649 --> 02:29.881
in all five boroughs.

02:29.883 --> 02:32.551
Now he's the head of
the northeast region

02:32.553 --> 02:34.386
of the United States
Department of Justice.

02:34.388 --> 02:36.088
And this guy right here,

02:36.090 --> 02:37.556
- this guy was my old boss...
- Ah.

02:37.558 --> 02:38.857
In the D.A.'s office.

02:38.859 --> 02:40.625
Now he's the head Poobah

02:40.627 --> 02:43.562
of the Federal Public
Investigation Unit.

02:43.564 --> 02:45.964
Well, clearly, you graduated
last in your class.

02:45.966 --> 02:47.432
You must be ashamed of yourself.

02:48.836 --> 02:53.405
And this is my current boss,
Dr. Jason Bull.

02:54.608 --> 02:57.175
Well, this is a great honor, Dr. Bull.

02:57.177 --> 03:00.078
Hope you don't mind us
talking a little shop.

03:00.080 --> 03:01.880
Our friend Benjamin
here has gotten himself

03:01.882 --> 03:03.648
into a little bit of a situation.

03:03.650 --> 03:04.850
Mm. What kind of situation?

03:04.852 --> 03:06.418
You ever heard of Hayden Watkins?

03:06.420 --> 03:08.987
They called him the Socialite Slayer?

03:08.989 --> 03:10.789
It was about ten years ago, now.

03:10.791 --> 03:12.757
They had all those clubs
here in the city back then,

03:12.759 --> 03:16.027
all those rich 19-year-olds
lining up with their phony IDs

03:16.029 --> 03:18.296
and their daddy's credit
cards to buy bottle service

03:18.298 --> 03:21.533
and to hook up with a married
man with an expense account.

03:21.535 --> 03:22.734
God bless America.

03:22.736 --> 03:24.402
This guy Hayden, he'd cruise the clubs,

03:24.404 --> 03:25.937
hook up with one of these rich kids,

03:25.939 --> 03:28.306
and then they'd
never hear from them again.

03:30.077 --> 03:33.178
He'd take 'em home,
do what he wanted to with them,

03:33.180 --> 03:36.867
and bury 'em at the edge
of Long Island in a landfill.

03:37.484 --> 03:39.985
Me and Benny, we put him away.

03:39.987 --> 03:41.553
Ah, look at you.

03:41.555 --> 03:42.687
Yeah, look at me.

03:42.689 --> 03:44.656
And then the Rectitude Project decided

03:44.658 --> 03:46.158
three or four months ago

03:46.160 --> 03:48.927
that maybe Hayden Watkins
had been railroaded.

03:49.713 --> 03:51.530
How so?

03:51.532 --> 03:54.699
Well, they convicted him with
hardly any physical evidence.

03:54.701 --> 03:57.469
No bodies. I mean, by the time

03:57.471 --> 03:59.104
we found where he was burying them,

03:59.106 --> 04:03.977
there... wasn't enough flesh to
pin him to any of the killings.

04:05.020 --> 04:07.089
But his last victim
was Tinsley Browning.

04:07.091 --> 04:09.748
Yeah, and as luck would have it,
one of her contact lenses

04:09.750 --> 04:10.949
was found in Watkins' apartment.

04:10.951 --> 04:13.818
Oh, actually, Benny found it.

04:13.820 --> 04:16.697
Contact lens had that
animal's DNA all over it.

04:17.457 --> 04:19.690
Don't ask me how it got there, but...

04:19.692 --> 04:21.286
it was there.

04:23.580 --> 04:25.130
I'm waiting for the twist.

04:25.132 --> 04:27.232
Well, well, here's the twist.

04:27.234 --> 04:31.203
Uh, the DNA test nine years
ago used five markers.

04:31.205 --> 04:33.405
Uh, and they were able to match three.

04:33.407 --> 04:35.807
Back then, that would be
considered a probable match.

04:35.809 --> 04:37.642
- Would've worked for me.
- But the new DNA test

04:37.644 --> 04:39.277
uses 50 markers.

04:39.279 --> 04:41.179
And when the Rectitude Project
tested the lens again

04:41.181 --> 04:43.915
two months ago, only 14 markers matched.

04:45.118 --> 04:47.085
Out of 50.

04:49.147 --> 04:50.522
Well, guys.

04:50.524 --> 04:51.756
I hate to say it, but I don't think

04:51.758 --> 04:53.792
we're gonna be staying for lunch. Benny?

04:53.794 --> 04:54.859
Did you tell him about the call?

04:54.861 --> 04:56.461
I told you, I didn't tell him anything.

04:56.463 --> 04:58.797
Well, he got a call the day
before trial from a detective

04:58.799 --> 05:01.866
out on Long Island,
working a kidnapping case,

05:01.868 --> 05:05.070
same exact M.O.,
but eyeing a different suspect.

05:05.072 --> 05:07.539
- All right, Benny, let's go.
- And that's a Brady violation.

05:07.541 --> 05:09.007
You were legally required
to disclose that call

05:09.009 --> 05:10.175
and all the particulars

05:10.177 --> 05:11.338
to the defense counsel.

05:11.340 --> 05:12.877
Guys, guys, you know as well as I know,

05:12.879 --> 05:14.312
this was a high profile case.

05:14.314 --> 05:15.947
We got hundreds of random tips

05:15.949 --> 05:18.016
every day that were meaningless.

05:18.018 --> 05:19.818
And we had our guy.

05:19.820 --> 05:20.986
And we found the contact lens...

05:20.988 --> 05:22.020
No, you found the lens.

05:22.022 --> 05:23.989
Is that your funeral procession outside?

05:23.991 --> 05:25.890
Don't act surprised. We all know
what's going on here.

05:25.892 --> 05:29.127
Benny, you know exactly
what's gonna happen next.

05:29.129 --> 05:30.228
You're a friend, Benny.

05:30.230 --> 05:31.997
I was giving you a chance to come clean.

05:31.999 --> 05:33.064
All right.

05:33.066 --> 05:34.165
Don't say a word.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.368
Let them cuff you, read your rights.

05:36.370 --> 05:38.029
We'll fix this in court.

05:39.130 --> 05:41.506
Benjamin Colón, you have
the right to remain silent.

05:41.508 --> 05:43.775
Anything you say can and
will be used against you

05:43.777 --> 05:44.976
in a court of law.

05:44.978 --> 05:46.845
You have the right to
speak with an attorney.

05:48.982 --> 05:50.048
Hmm. Tie.

05:50.050 --> 05:51.116
What? No, Chunk says
that one's for Benny.

05:51.118 --> 05:52.350
This one's for you.

05:53.628 --> 05:55.787
I was talking to one of the FBI guys

05:55.789 --> 05:57.455
while they were processing Benny.

05:57.457 --> 05:58.823
He seemed almost certain

05:58.825 --> 06:00.392
they were gonna charge him
with a misdemeanor.

06:00.394 --> 06:01.872
No jail time.

06:01.874 --> 06:03.595
Phew.

06:07.934 --> 06:09.401
- Hello.
- Thank you.

06:09.403 --> 06:10.335
Of course.

06:10.337 --> 06:11.703
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.204
Your noose, sir.

06:15.075 --> 06:16.875
Does, uh, everyone at TAC know?

06:16.877 --> 06:18.610
Know what?

06:18.612 --> 06:20.478
I hear that.

06:20.480 --> 06:22.314
Let's just get this over with.

06:22.316 --> 06:24.516
I'll plead guilty and take my lumps.

06:28.822 --> 06:30.588
You know they're gonna
probably want to suspend

06:30.590 --> 06:32.657
your license to practice.

06:32.659 --> 06:35.003
Maybe I should've told
them about that call.

06:35.562 --> 06:36.961
Who knows?

06:36.963 --> 06:39.964
Fine me, suspend me for a year
for not reporting that call,

06:39.966 --> 06:42.133
but I'm gonna tell you this, though.

06:42.135 --> 06:44.936
When this crapstorm first
started raining down on me,

06:44.938 --> 06:47.015
I was convinced that they were right.

06:47.774 --> 06:50.475
You know, m-m-maybe I-I-I messed up.

06:50.477 --> 06:53.912
Maybe, maybe I-I did
something seriously wrong.

06:54.439 --> 06:56.414
Because science says
th-that he's innocent,

06:56.416 --> 06:58.216
so, so he has to be innocent, right?

06:58.218 --> 06:59.903
But I ran it through my head.

07:00.354 --> 07:02.320
Over and over and over again.

07:02.322 --> 07:03.688
And I know two things.

07:05.826 --> 07:07.892
I really didn't do anything wrong,

07:07.894 --> 07:09.663
and he is guilty as sin.

07:13.433 --> 07:14.999
Tinsley Browning's parents.

07:15.001 --> 07:16.935
Can't believe they have
to go through this again.

07:16.937 --> 07:19.796
Huh. Are they sitting
with the district attorney?

07:19.798 --> 07:21.740
And is that counsel for
the City of New York?

07:21.742 --> 07:22.974
Yeah, I think so.

07:22.976 --> 07:25.176
The hell is he doing here?

07:28.115 --> 07:29.581
It's a full house, Benny.

07:29.583 --> 07:30.782
All rise.

07:30.784 --> 07:33.032
I'm not sure this is gonna
go the way we planned.

07:33.745 --> 07:35.954
Afternoon, everyone.
Let's jump right in.

07:35.956 --> 07:39.424
Benjamin Colón, you stand charged

07:39.426 --> 07:40.725
with obstruction of justice

07:40.727 --> 07:43.318
for failure to disclose
exculpatory evidence.

07:43.320 --> 07:45.230
Additionally, you stand charged

07:45.232 --> 07:48.700
with a violation of civil rights
for tampering with evidence.

07:48.702 --> 07:50.368
- What?
- They think you planted that lens

07:50.370 --> 07:51.770
at Hayden Watkins' apartment.

07:51.772 --> 07:53.104
Seriously?

07:53.106 --> 07:56.141
No, I would never do anything
like that; they know that.

07:56.143 --> 07:57.475
I don't think they care, Benny.
Look around,

07:57.477 --> 07:59.210
we're the only people in this room

07:59.212 --> 08:01.112
who didn't see this coming.

08:05.152 --> 08:07.042
Mr. Colón, how do you plead?

08:07.044 --> 08:08.471
Not guilty.

08:09.256 --> 08:11.433
Absolutely not guilty.

08:43.089 --> 08:44.389
I don't understand.

08:44.391 --> 08:46.424
You said it was gonna
be a slap on the wrist.

08:46.426 --> 08:48.255
Benny could get ten years.

08:48.720 --> 08:50.462
Why doesn't he just take a plea?

08:50.464 --> 08:52.515
'Cause they didn't offer him a plea.

08:53.241 --> 08:54.907
They want him to go to prison.

08:54.909 --> 08:56.475
But why? Why Benny?

08:56.477 --> 08:59.378
I'm guessing this new DNA test
has the D.A.'s office spooked.

08:59.380 --> 09:00.780
They secured a lot of convictions

09:00.782 --> 09:02.214
with the original test.

09:02.216 --> 09:04.517
And nobody is excited about having

09:04.519 --> 09:06.419
their old cases getting a second look,

09:06.421 --> 09:09.822
so they're changing the conversation.

09:09.824 --> 09:12.191
This isn't about DNA.

09:13.161 --> 09:15.795
It's about planting evidence,
about Benny planting evidence,

09:15.797 --> 09:17.624
which he swears he didn't do.

09:19.334 --> 09:20.857
Can I do anything?

09:22.020 --> 09:23.838
Can I get you anything?

09:26.941 --> 09:29.842
You're like an encyclopedia of lawyers.

09:31.012 --> 09:33.813
I need you to do
some research for me tonight.

09:33.815 --> 09:36.182
I need the best there is
when it comes to cases

09:36.184 --> 09:38.751
involving the Department
of Justice, the FBI.

09:38.753 --> 09:39.952
Somebody who's got those guys

09:39.954 --> 09:41.754
completely wired, and I want to get in

09:41.756 --> 09:43.656
and see him first thing in the morning.

09:44.234 --> 09:45.902
Can you do that for me?

09:47.112 --> 09:48.627
Do that for Benny?

09:48.629 --> 09:50.196
Sure, of course.

09:50.782 --> 09:53.118
I'll head home right now and get on it.

09:54.035 --> 09:56.569
Make that your last drink.

10:07.715 --> 10:08.848
Hello.

10:08.850 --> 10:10.216
Bull, it's Marissa.

10:10.218 --> 10:12.585
Everyone I've spoken to
says the person Benny needs

10:12.587 --> 10:13.886
is J.P. Nunnelly.

10:14.431 --> 10:15.955
Nunnelly.

10:16.599 --> 10:18.324
I've never heard of him.

10:18.326 --> 10:19.759
Can you get me in to see him?

10:19.761 --> 10:21.394
Well, that's the thing, I took a shot,

10:21.396 --> 10:23.629
called the office, thinking they
might have an emergency line,

10:23.631 --> 10:25.798
and to my amazement,
an assistant answered.

10:25.800 --> 10:27.600
She put me on hold
for a minute and a half

10:27.602 --> 10:30.836
and then asked if you were
available for a meeting now.

10:31.698 --> 10:34.273
Now? It's 3:50 in the morning.

10:34.275 --> 10:36.709
Actually, the time
they suggested was 4:30.

10:37.245 --> 10:38.944
In the morning.

10:38.946 --> 10:41.313
In the morning, 40 minutes from now.

10:43.918 --> 10:45.751
Okay.

10:45.753 --> 10:47.219
Where's his office?

10:47.221 --> 10:50.489
Well, actually, they want to do
the meeting in a restaurant.

10:50.491 --> 10:53.159
On Third Avenue.
I'll text you the address.

10:53.636 --> 10:56.262
In a restaurant at 4:30 in the morning.

10:56.264 --> 10:58.130
I'm just the messenger, Bull.

11:11.279 --> 11:12.655
Hello?

11:15.617 --> 11:17.249
Anybody here?

11:17.251 --> 11:19.037
Hello?

11:37.655 --> 11:41.173
Dear Marissa, I hate you.

11:41.175 --> 11:46.278
The dream I was dreaming before
you called and woke me up

11:46.280 --> 11:51.484
involved all kinds of ridiculous
and illegal activ...

11:51.486 --> 11:55.421
Oh, thank God, somebody's here.

11:55.423 --> 11:56.922
Wow, look at you.

11:56.924 --> 11:58.491
How'd you luck out and get this shift?

11:58.493 --> 12:00.192
I hope they pool the tips around here.

12:00.194 --> 12:02.061
Could I get a cappuccino?

12:02.063 --> 12:06.532
Mr. Bull, my name's J.P. Nunnelly.

12:08.636 --> 12:10.636
Oh, wow, sorry.

12:10.638 --> 12:13.606
I... what are the chances

12:13.608 --> 12:15.774
of you forgetting the last two
minutes of your life?

12:15.776 --> 12:18.878
Would you like to talk
about Benjamin Colón?

12:18.880 --> 12:20.279
You know why I'm here?

12:20.281 --> 12:21.847
Well, I never agree to meet someone

12:21.849 --> 12:24.116
if I'm not reasonably certain
I have the answers

12:24.118 --> 12:25.551
to most of their questions.

12:25.553 --> 12:26.719
Well, then answer me this.

12:26.721 --> 12:28.587
What are you doing up
at 4:30 in the morning?

12:28.589 --> 12:30.856
I'm not up at 4:30
in the morning, Mr. Bull.

12:30.858 --> 12:31.924
I'm up at 3:00.

12:31.926 --> 12:33.259
Most mornings by this time

12:33.261 --> 12:34.360
I've already worked out,

12:34.362 --> 12:36.228
checked my e-mails and called Europe.

12:36.230 --> 12:37.496
That's very impressive.

12:37.498 --> 12:38.964
It is what it is.

12:38.966 --> 12:42.601
So, what are we doing in this
restaurant all by ourselves

12:42.603 --> 12:43.869
at this ungodly hour?

12:43.871 --> 12:45.037
I own it...

12:45.039 --> 12:47.673
a piece of it, anyway.

12:47.675 --> 12:48.665
I wanted to meet you,

12:48.667 --> 12:50.643
and this was the only
time I had available.

12:50.645 --> 12:52.578
I've got three floors over on Fifth,

12:52.580 --> 12:55.614
but I find office
buildings are truly spooky

12:55.616 --> 12:58.183
at this hour of the morning,
so I hope this is okay.

12:58.887 --> 13:00.638
Now, about Mr. Colón.

13:01.589 --> 13:03.589
Would you like me to fix it?

13:04.193 --> 13:05.271
Excuse me?

13:05.273 --> 13:06.892
I don't know what you know about me,

13:06.894 --> 13:10.563
but I'm a fixer, Mr. Bull.

13:10.565 --> 13:12.932
Sometimes I make things happen,

13:12.934 --> 13:14.967
sometimes I make things go away.

13:15.528 --> 13:18.671
It's how I got to be managing
partner of my own law firm

13:18.673 --> 13:20.272
with offices in three states.

13:20.950 --> 13:23.642
People have a problem, I fix it.

13:23.644 --> 13:26.039
Mr. Colón clearly has a problem.

13:27.214 --> 13:28.914
Want me to take care of it?

13:30.251 --> 13:31.450
Please.

13:31.452 --> 13:34.653
Excellent. Stay by your phone.

13:34.655 --> 13:35.654
Wait a second.

13:35.656 --> 13:37.089
So, how does this work?

13:37.342 --> 13:38.791
What do you mean?

13:40.511 --> 13:42.361
Money?

13:42.363 --> 13:45.864
No, I'm not interested
in your money, Mr. Bull.

13:45.866 --> 13:51.170
I'm interested in your work,
in your science, in your company.

13:51.172 --> 13:53.639
I'm offering to do you
a professional favor.

13:53.641 --> 13:54.873
All I expect is for you,

13:54.875 --> 13:59.078
or rather your company,
to do me one in return.

13:59.080 --> 14:00.879
I will stay by my phone.

14:00.881 --> 14:02.784
You do that.

14:07.254 --> 14:09.655
Don't worry, I'll lock up.

14:22.195 --> 14:23.328
Wow.

14:23.330 --> 14:24.763
Look at this place.

14:24.765 --> 14:27.332
I'm clearly in more
trouble than I thought.

14:27.809 --> 14:29.200
Thank you, Bull.

14:29.202 --> 14:30.502
I haven't done anything yet.

14:31.579 --> 14:32.804
Ah.

14:32.806 --> 14:34.339
Here comes the cavalry.

14:34.341 --> 14:35.440
Mr. Colón.

14:35.442 --> 14:37.576
I'm J.P. Nunnelly. Pleasure to meet you.

14:37.578 --> 14:38.677
Likewise.

14:38.679 --> 14:39.946
Right this way.

14:41.481 --> 14:43.415
So, here's what we've got,

14:43.925 --> 14:46.251
and I, for one, am
pretty pleased with it.

14:46.253 --> 14:48.453
We've won you your freedom, Mr. Colón.

14:49.122 --> 14:52.157
I've managed to convince
the U.S. Attorney's office

14:52.159 --> 14:54.726
to accept a plea deal.

14:54.728 --> 14:56.227
No prison time.

14:57.864 --> 14:59.397
No, wait, wait, wait,

14:59.399 --> 15:04.402
but-but... yesterday they said
that there was no plea deal.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.004
That was yesterday.

15:06.006 --> 15:08.073
Yesterday was not in my purview.

15:08.075 --> 15:09.074
Welcome to today.

15:09.076 --> 15:10.842
Say thank you, Benny.

15:11.310 --> 15:14.679
But-but you said deal.

15:14.681 --> 15:16.651
That means you have to give something

15:16.653 --> 15:17.811
in order to get something.

15:17.813 --> 15:20.619
What... what do I have to give?

15:20.621 --> 15:24.032
In return for not spending
ten years in prison

15:24.758 --> 15:26.458
as an ex-prosecutor?

15:26.460 --> 15:30.095
Rubbing elbows and maybe
a whole lot more with men

15:30.097 --> 15:31.796
you helped to put away?

15:31.798 --> 15:33.765
Let's reframe the question.

15:33.767 --> 15:35.508
What wouldn't you give?

15:35.510 --> 15:37.754
J.P., please.

15:38.639 --> 15:39.971
What do they want from Benny?

15:39.973 --> 15:43.274
An apology. A public apology.

15:43.276 --> 15:45.134
- For what?
- For planting evidence.

15:45.136 --> 15:46.425
But I didn't plant any evidence.

15:46.427 --> 15:47.746
Given your current situation,

15:47.748 --> 15:50.115
- that's rather beside the point.
- No.

15:50.117 --> 15:51.416
It's the only point.

15:51.418 --> 15:52.884
And I didn't do it.

15:52.886 --> 15:54.598
And Hayden Watkins did.

15:54.600 --> 15:56.588
And-and can we just talk
about that for a minute?

15:56.590 --> 16:00.158
If I sign a document saying
that I planted the contact lens,

16:00.160 --> 16:03.828
within 48 hours, his attorney
is going to file paperwork

16:03.830 --> 16:07.365
for his exoneration because
the question would no longer be

16:07.367 --> 16:09.901
why his DNA is not on the contact lens.

16:09.903 --> 16:12.570
The question is going to be:
where are the keys to his cell

16:12.572 --> 16:14.305
and how fast can we get him
out of there?

16:14.307 --> 16:16.608
Because maybe, just maybe...

16:16.610 --> 16:18.143
we can put a ceiling on how many

16:18.145 --> 16:20.745
millions of dollars
he sues the city for.

16:20.747 --> 16:24.683
And lest we forget that-that
this newly-minted millionaire

16:24.685 --> 16:26.552
is a murderer...

16:27.059 --> 16:29.921
who kidnapped, strangled
and buried three girls.

16:29.923 --> 16:31.823
Are you telling me that my friends

16:31.825 --> 16:33.958
at the Justice Department
would much rather see that

16:33.960 --> 16:35.260
than try to get to the bottom of this?

16:35.262 --> 16:37.862
Yes, that's exactly
what I'm telling you.

16:38.481 --> 16:40.298
They want this to go away.

16:40.300 --> 16:43.101
And as for Hayden Watkins,
any filing for exoneration

16:43.103 --> 16:45.837
would take years to make
its way through the courts.

16:45.839 --> 16:46.805
Right, right, right.

16:46.807 --> 16:48.606
With my name next to his, uh,

16:48.608 --> 16:50.208
in-in-in-in every article,

16:50.210 --> 16:52.043
every-every-every Internet story...

16:52.045 --> 16:55.080
Which still beats ten years in prison.

16:55.082 --> 16:57.792
Not to me! Not to me!

17:02.088 --> 17:03.555
I want to go to court.

17:03.557 --> 17:04.989
I want to go to trial.

17:11.867 --> 17:12.830
Talk to your friend.

17:12.833 --> 17:15.233
Don't have to. We want to go to trial.

17:23.310 --> 17:25.143
It's me, don't shoot.

17:25.145 --> 17:26.563
Um...

17:26.565 --> 17:29.514
I just want to say no harm, no foul.

17:29.516 --> 17:32.517
Uh, I appreciate all the work you did.

17:33.119 --> 17:35.153
And, uh, Benny does, too.

17:35.155 --> 17:37.555
He... in his own way.

17:39.126 --> 17:41.059
I still owe you one.

17:41.460 --> 17:43.795
I'm looking forward to you
taking me up on it.

17:43.797 --> 17:45.296
Wait a second.

17:45.756 --> 17:47.132
Am I being released?

17:47.134 --> 17:48.384
Well, yeah.

17:49.260 --> 17:51.136
I know you're a fixer.

17:51.138 --> 17:52.103
That's your deal.

17:52.105 --> 17:53.569
You, uh, make the problem go away.

17:53.571 --> 17:55.062
I mean, the whole point of you

17:55.064 --> 17:56.731
is so you never have to go to court.

17:56.733 --> 17:59.778
Clearly, we are going to court.

17:59.780 --> 18:00.912
So, uh...

18:00.914 --> 18:02.981
I need a litigator.

18:02.983 --> 18:06.123
If you've got any names, feel
free to toss them in the hat.

18:06.125 --> 18:07.987
Wait a second, Mr. Bull.

18:08.488 --> 18:10.948
You're not releasing me.

18:11.725 --> 18:13.458
I'm releasing you.

18:14.518 --> 18:15.860
- Really?
- Yeah.

18:15.862 --> 18:17.328
Really.

18:17.330 --> 18:19.731
I didn't violate our agreement.

18:19.733 --> 18:21.299
You did.

18:21.301 --> 18:24.936
I promised to make your problem
go away and I did that.

18:24.938 --> 18:27.305
I played a card that
I can never play again

18:27.307 --> 18:28.940
with the U.S. Attorney's office,

18:28.942 --> 18:32.443
but you and Atticus Finch
decided to go to trial anyway.

18:32.445 --> 18:35.180
Don't you just hate
people with integrity?

18:35.182 --> 18:39.851
- No, but right now I really hate you.
- Hmm.

18:39.853 --> 18:42.772
Did he really think that he
would get something for nothing?

18:43.790 --> 18:45.857
And for your information,

18:45.859 --> 18:50.228
the only name I'd consider
putting in your hat is my own.

18:50.230 --> 18:53.398
I am a world-class litigator.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.033
World-class.

18:55.035 --> 18:59.237
The court is my church and
I am its high priestess.

18:59.239 --> 19:00.471
Uh-huh.

19:00.473 --> 19:03.141
The only way you get to be a great fixer

19:03.143 --> 19:05.810
is because people are afraid
of meeting you in court.

19:05.812 --> 19:07.412
So, get it straight, Mr. Bull,

19:07.414 --> 19:09.113
you're not releasing me.

19:09.115 --> 19:10.415
I'm releasing you.

19:10.417 --> 19:11.516
Okay, now, wait a second.

19:11.518 --> 19:13.518
Maybe nobody needs to release anybody.

19:13.520 --> 19:14.953
Oh, right.

19:14.955 --> 19:16.454
Lucky me.

19:16.456 --> 19:18.089
My firm would get the privilege

19:18.091 --> 19:21.392
of spending countless hours
and precious resources

19:21.394 --> 19:23.294
defending a man
who isn't even smart enough

19:23.296 --> 19:25.496
to know a good deal
when it's presented to him?

19:25.498 --> 19:26.649
That man has character.

19:27.200 --> 19:29.334
And he deserves a world-class litigator.

19:29.336 --> 19:32.170
Just to be clear, I'll
be paying his legal fees.

19:32.172 --> 19:33.571
It'll be worth it

19:33.573 --> 19:35.616
just to watch you work.

19:36.977 --> 19:40.011
I took this case as a favor to you.

19:40.663 --> 19:43.314
- So I could watch you work.
- Then what are we doing?

19:43.316 --> 19:46.217
Let's go to court. One big happy family.

19:47.053 --> 19:49.505
Three cases.

19:50.290 --> 19:52.790
I do this one case for you,

19:52.792 --> 19:55.026
you do three cases for me.

19:55.028 --> 19:57.395
Hmm. Three?

19:57.397 --> 19:59.564
Three.

19:59.566 --> 20:01.766
You can count to three, can't you?

20:01.768 --> 20:03.352
Give me a second.

20:06.172 --> 20:07.605
Three.

20:07.607 --> 20:08.706
If you win.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.642
<i>You mean when I win.</i>

20:10.644 --> 20:12.477
Is that what I meant?

20:12.987 --> 20:15.346
See you in court, Mr. Bull.

20:32.164 --> 20:35.565
I really got to change
that alarm one of these days.

20:37.502 --> 20:38.635
Well, hey.

20:38.637 --> 20:39.869
Look at you.

20:40.281 --> 20:41.514
4:30 in the morning,

20:41.516 --> 20:43.182
and you're bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.

20:43.184 --> 20:45.017
Please. I've been up since midnight.

20:45.019 --> 20:47.153
Called Africa. Invented a flying car.

20:47.155 --> 20:49.565
Figured out the whole
Arab-Israeli thing.

20:55.730 --> 20:57.198
Wow.

20:58.199 --> 21:00.433
Come. Meet my baby.

21:05.340 --> 21:08.374
Explain this to me.

21:08.376 --> 21:10.877
Because this, I do not understand.

21:11.545 --> 21:14.647
Well, that's why I wanted you to see it.

21:14.649 --> 21:16.649
You're going to court today.

21:16.651 --> 21:17.917
<i>We're going to court today,</i>

21:17.919 --> 21:19.785
and I wanted you to know all the tools

21:19.787 --> 21:22.221
you have at your disposal.

21:22.223 --> 21:23.890
Okay.

21:23.892 --> 21:26.492
In my experience,
you prepare like a madwoman.

21:26.494 --> 21:27.693
You gather your facts.

21:27.695 --> 21:29.729
You assemble a narrative
to support them.

21:29.731 --> 21:30.976
Pretty straightforward.

21:30.978 --> 21:33.299
But that assumes that everyone
hears those facts

21:33.301 --> 21:35.701
the same way you do and
with the same meaning.

21:35.703 --> 21:38.237
And that they draw the same
conclusion that you do,

21:38.262 --> 21:41.240
but experience suggests
that's not always the case.

21:42.090 --> 21:43.177
Say we have a jury.

21:45.079 --> 21:46.212
And on this jury there are all different

21:46.214 --> 21:47.213
kinds of people, right?

21:47.215 --> 21:48.381
Cross section of the community.

21:48.383 --> 21:51.250
You got this guy here,
the shoe salesman.

21:51.252 --> 21:53.386
You got a guy who owns
a used car dealership.

21:53.388 --> 21:55.021
And this lady hasn't
worked in five months,

21:55.023 --> 21:56.856
et cetera, et cetera.

21:56.858 --> 22:00.159
We find out everything we can
about them.

22:00.161 --> 22:01.900
Their opinions, their prejudices,

22:01.902 --> 22:04.397
their religion,
their political affiliations,

22:04.399 --> 22:08.100
their age, their playlist, their
favorite flavor of ice cream.

22:09.904 --> 22:11.337
Episcopalian,

22:11.339 --> 22:14.040
Independent, none of your damn business,

22:14.042 --> 22:16.509
I'll send it to you, and fudge ripple.

22:16.511 --> 22:17.677
Huh.

22:17.679 --> 22:19.845
- I didn't see that coming.
- Hmm.

22:19.847 --> 22:22.381
Then what we do, we find
the closest approximate match

22:22.383 --> 22:24.717
to each juror,

22:24.719 --> 22:27.286
and we bring them all
into the courtroom.

22:27.288 --> 22:29.922
We clock their attitudes and feelings.

22:29.924 --> 22:32.091
We basically give you

22:32.093 --> 22:34.627
an approximate indication in
real time of whether or not

22:34.629 --> 22:37.663
all your hard work, all those
facts you've gathered

22:37.665 --> 22:40.933
to support that narrative
that you've created

22:40.935 --> 22:43.069
is being heard the way you intended.

22:43.071 --> 22:44.346
Hmm.

22:45.373 --> 22:47.740
I'm not sure I buy it.

22:47.742 --> 22:50.443
I'm not sure it's possible
to predict behavior this way.

22:53.448 --> 22:56.482
Well, it's a science.

22:56.484 --> 22:58.317
It's pretty dependable.

23:03.524 --> 23:05.124
Come here.

23:05.126 --> 23:06.892
I'll give you a demonstration.

23:14.585 --> 23:15.901
Relax.

23:18.339 --> 23:20.090
If I was gonna do this...

23:21.242 --> 23:22.508
I'm pretty sure you'd do that.

23:22.510 --> 23:24.343
You can be certain.

23:24.345 --> 23:27.573
And if I were to do this...

23:31.619 --> 23:35.121
I'm pretty certain you would do that.

23:35.123 --> 23:37.089
Not sure that's science.

23:37.091 --> 23:39.725
And if I were to do this...

23:43.572 --> 23:45.464
I'll kick you so hard in the balls

23:45.466 --> 23:47.933
your dead grandfather will scream.

23:47.935 --> 23:49.535
Huh.

23:50.429 --> 23:52.204
See, I knew you were gonna say that.

23:52.206 --> 23:54.807
Hmm.

23:54.809 --> 23:57.677
And all of this touching and flirting

23:57.679 --> 23:59.912
is supposed to help me
in the courtroom how?

24:01.398 --> 24:03.549
Well, it's kind of hard to
explain in the abstract.

24:03.551 --> 24:05.427
Hmm.

24:08.322 --> 24:12.658
We're not losing our way here, are we?

24:12.660 --> 24:15.020
Well, how do you mean?

24:16.964 --> 24:20.700
All I'm looking for
out of this... partnership

24:20.702 --> 24:23.302
is to win your friend's freedom.

24:23.304 --> 24:26.272
And perhaps learn a little bit
about trial science

24:26.274 --> 24:28.541
or whatever it is you call it.

24:28.543 --> 24:30.376
Assuming it is a science.

24:30.378 --> 24:32.411
Assuming there's something to learn.

24:32.413 --> 24:34.513
It is, and there's a lot to learn,

24:34.515 --> 24:37.883
and... me, too.

24:38.720 --> 24:40.696
The Benny's freedom part, I mean.

24:45.442 --> 24:47.193
I apologize if I'm acting

24:47.195 --> 24:51.030
a little... goofy, flirty.

24:51.932 --> 24:53.632
Distracted.

24:54.059 --> 24:55.835
I think the psychologist in me

24:55.837 --> 24:58.564
would probably speculate
that I'm trying to avoid...

25:01.809 --> 25:03.943
...thinking about the situation

25:03.945 --> 25:06.071
that Benny finds himself in.

25:07.740 --> 25:10.367
He's my friend
and I'm frightened for him.

25:15.723 --> 25:17.499
Tell me I shouldn't be.

25:19.126 --> 25:20.836
I can't do that.

25:21.754 --> 25:23.362
I don't do what you do.

25:23.364 --> 25:25.464
I don't speculate about human behavior

25:25.466 --> 25:27.718
or anything else.

25:28.469 --> 25:30.721
I just show up prepared.

25:31.405 --> 25:33.766
And it's mostly worked for me.

25:41.783 --> 25:43.783
Come on, Dr. Bull.

25:43.785 --> 25:45.651
Let's go plead our case.

25:50.391 --> 25:51.957
Mr. Colón.

25:51.959 --> 25:53.926
If you had to put a number
on it, how many times

25:53.928 --> 25:56.362
would you say you visited
Hayden Watkins' apartment?

25:56.364 --> 25:58.497
Actually, I checked my notes
and calendar this morning,

25:58.499 --> 26:00.619
and I believe it was six times.

26:00.621 --> 26:02.162
Six times?

26:02.269 --> 26:04.496
So you examined this man's apartment

26:04.521 --> 26:06.254
on five other occasions,

26:06.256 --> 26:07.856
and over a period of...

26:07.858 --> 26:09.557
What would you say?

26:09.559 --> 26:12.060
Two, two and a half months or so.

26:12.062 --> 26:13.762
Two, two and a half months or so.

26:13.764 --> 26:15.930
And you never saw this contact lens?

26:16.308 --> 26:17.332
I did not.

26:17.334 --> 26:19.171
And you weren't the only
person examining this apartment,

26:19.173 --> 26:20.068
is that correct?

26:20.070 --> 26:21.569
No. It was forensics,

26:21.571 --> 26:23.705
local police, FBI.

26:23.707 --> 26:25.012
I don't know. A lot of people.

26:25.037 --> 26:26.410
And if you had to put a number on that,

26:26.412 --> 26:27.342
a number on the people, I mean.

26:27.344 --> 26:30.278
Objection. The prosecution is
asking my client to speculate.

26:30.280 --> 26:32.981
I think the jury's capable
of understanding the context

26:32.983 --> 26:34.883
in which the question is being asked.

26:34.885 --> 26:36.918
The prosecutor is attempting
to make a point,

26:36.920 --> 26:39.254
and I'd like to see him make it.
Objection overruled.

26:39.256 --> 26:40.723
Score one for the other team.

26:40.725 --> 26:41.856
Mr. Colón,

26:41.858 --> 26:43.792
an estimate. No one's gonna file
additional charges

26:43.794 --> 26:45.560
if the number isn't perfectly accurate.

26:45.562 --> 26:47.314
Mm-hmm.

26:48.165 --> 26:52.267
I don't know. 60, 65 people maybe.

26:52.269 --> 26:53.802
Okay. 60, 65 people.

26:53.804 --> 26:55.236
And of course, they weren't all

26:55.238 --> 26:56.771
in the apartment at the same time.

26:56.773 --> 26:58.273
So, again,

26:58.275 --> 27:00.241
with your attorney's
permission, of course,

27:00.243 --> 27:01.609
could you estimate

27:01.611 --> 27:05.179
how many individual visits by
various law enforcement branches

27:05.181 --> 27:07.673
were conducted on
Hayden Watkins' apartment

27:07.675 --> 27:09.918
for the sole purpose of
collecting evidence?

27:10.404 --> 27:11.753
No.

27:13.223 --> 27:15.724
I would like to enter into evidence

27:15.726 --> 27:17.286
this log...

27:18.428 --> 27:21.596
which indicates 27
separate visits were made

27:21.598 --> 27:24.566
to Mr. Watkins' apartment
prior to Mr. Colón discovering

27:24.568 --> 27:26.336
that contact lens.

27:27.337 --> 27:28.837
27 visits.

27:29.173 --> 27:32.640
60 different people, all of them
trained to look for evidence.

27:33.093 --> 27:34.803
And no one found it.

27:35.512 --> 27:37.312
No one but you.

27:37.806 --> 27:39.314
Is there a name for that, Mr. Colón?

27:39.316 --> 27:41.149
I don't know what you're
asking me, Mr. Janson.

27:41.151 --> 27:42.383
I'm asking what your reaction is

27:42.385 --> 27:44.419
when you hear those kinds of numbers.

27:44.421 --> 27:46.354
I mean, you're a law enforcement
professional.

27:46.356 --> 27:47.922
Surely you had a reaction at the time.

27:47.924 --> 27:50.401
Objection. Counselor's badgering
the witness, Your Honor.

27:50.403 --> 27:52.587
- Objection overruled.
- What do you call that?

27:52.589 --> 27:54.413
You know, your case is falling apart.

27:54.415 --> 27:56.052
There's no physical evidence
to make it stick.

27:56.054 --> 27:57.365
And then...

27:57.367 --> 27:58.967
suddenly there is, and wh...

27:58.969 --> 28:00.769
what do you call that?

28:00.771 --> 28:02.499
I know what I would call that.

28:02.501 --> 28:05.473
I would call that a miracle.

28:08.986 --> 28:10.714
You believe in miracles, Mr. Colón?

28:14.317 --> 28:16.518
They just scored the extra point.

28:16.520 --> 28:18.419
Your witness.

28:18.421 --> 28:20.766
Let's take an hour recess for lunch.

28:21.625 --> 28:24.840
Uh, just so you know,
in terms of the jury...

28:24.842 --> 28:25.927
Please.

28:25.929 --> 28:28.398
A blind man could read that jury.

28:39.034 --> 28:41.620
Why didn't you
just take the deal, Benny?

28:42.829 --> 28:44.679
You don't even need your license.

28:44.681 --> 28:47.960
Everybody knows you practice
pretend law for Dr. Bull.

28:49.336 --> 28:50.671
Wow.

28:52.339 --> 28:54.289
That's what this is about
to you, huh, Will?

28:55.092 --> 28:56.224
How I make my living?

28:57.010 --> 29:00.929
I'm just saying, this trial
could go sideways.

29:02.599 --> 29:04.332
I don't want to see anything bad
happen to you.

29:04.334 --> 29:05.667
No one does.

29:05.669 --> 29:07.354
That was never the plan.

29:08.271 --> 29:11.624
Why not just say you regret what you did

29:11.626 --> 29:13.208
and let's be done with it?

29:17.814 --> 29:19.174
Sorry, Will.

29:19.950 --> 29:22.452
I just don't know how to do that.

29:25.422 --> 29:27.332
I feel bad for you, Benny.

29:28.959 --> 29:31.211
I feel bad for me, too, Will.

29:44.533 --> 29:46.800
Tell us about the day
you found the contact lens.

29:46.802 --> 29:47.901
What about it?

29:47.903 --> 29:49.903
What was the state of the case?

29:49.905 --> 29:52.077
- Were you high on it?
- High?

29:53.174 --> 29:54.735
What's the opposite of high?

29:55.610 --> 29:58.845
We had a ton of circumstantial evidence.

29:58.847 --> 30:00.813
People had seen Hayden at the clubs.

30:00.815 --> 30:03.182
They had seen him
interacting with the women.

30:03.184 --> 30:05.485
We'd interviewed him a number of times

30:05.487 --> 30:07.287
and knew that he was
psychologically capable

30:07.289 --> 30:08.445
of committing the crimes.

30:08.447 --> 30:12.792
His MySpace page practically
read as a textbook example

30:12.794 --> 30:14.761
of a sociopath's manifesto.

30:14.763 --> 30:18.898
But... none of that proved he did it.

30:18.900 --> 30:20.600
You must have felt an enormous

30:20.602 --> 30:21.634
amount of pressure.

30:21.636 --> 30:22.936
The case was on the front page

30:22.938 --> 30:26.572
of the paper at least
once or twice a week.

30:26.574 --> 30:28.608
People just wanted him
locked up, put away.

30:28.610 --> 30:30.694
They were afraid, afraid to let

30:30.723 --> 30:32.846
their daughters go out,

30:32.847 --> 30:34.747
their sisters, their girlfriends.

30:34.749 --> 30:36.249
And what about Mr. Janson?

30:36.251 --> 30:37.850
Was he feeling the pressure?

30:37.852 --> 30:40.386
I'm not sure the jury is aware;
he was your boss

30:40.388 --> 30:42.855
at the district attorney's
office at the time, wasn't he?

30:42.857 --> 30:44.409
We all wanted the same thing.

30:45.074 --> 30:47.427
Well, you must have
been very frustrated.

30:47.429 --> 30:49.362
Well, Mr. Watkins

30:49.364 --> 30:52.131
was extraordinarily meticulous

30:52.133 --> 30:53.967
in how he handled the killings.

30:53.969 --> 30:55.969
There simply was no physical evidence

30:55.971 --> 30:57.437
to tie him to the crimes.

30:57.439 --> 31:00.133
Did you ever have a moment of doubt?

31:00.608 --> 31:03.376
Did you ever think, Maybe

31:03.378 --> 31:04.978
we have the wrong guyâ?

31:05.931 --> 31:07.113
No.

31:07.115 --> 31:08.600
And why was that?

31:19.039 --> 31:21.390
Hey, it's okay, Mr. Colón.

31:21.963 --> 31:23.930
You're here to defend yourself.

31:24.658 --> 31:26.032
Let me help you.

31:26.034 --> 31:29.268
What happened two weeks
before you found the lens?

31:30.725 --> 31:32.739
There was a break in the case,
wasn't there?

31:34.292 --> 31:35.675
He confessed.

31:38.346 --> 31:40.336
Finally. That woke them up.

31:40.338 --> 31:42.315
We've got a tiny bit of movement.

31:42.317 --> 31:44.417
He told us where
the bodies were, how he did it.

31:44.419 --> 31:46.085
And none of that is in the court record.

31:46.087 --> 31:47.086
No.

31:47.088 --> 31:48.488
Can you tell us why?

31:48.490 --> 31:50.757
Because a day later he recanted.

31:50.759 --> 31:52.992
Claimed that the young detective

31:52.994 --> 31:56.029
who had obtained his confession
had coerced him.

31:56.031 --> 31:58.898
Denied him of food and drink,
put his hands on him.

31:58.900 --> 32:00.099
Wasn't the confession videotaped?

32:00.101 --> 32:01.134
It was.

32:01.136 --> 32:02.235
And what did it show?

32:02.237 --> 32:03.836
Everything that the suspect claimed.

32:03.838 --> 32:05.728
Of course, the judge agreed with him.

32:05.730 --> 32:07.573
Felt that the confession was coerced,

32:07.575 --> 32:10.576
therefore it was expunged
from the record.

32:10.578 --> 32:12.245
What did you think?

32:13.348 --> 32:15.448
Well, we all thought the same thing.

32:16.168 --> 32:20.586
The suspect had coerced the
detective into coercing him.

32:22.223 --> 32:23.923
He goaded the kid.

32:24.217 --> 32:25.552
He wanted it.

32:26.194 --> 32:28.061
Wanted us to know where the girls were.

32:28.063 --> 32:29.352
Wanted to play with us.

32:29.354 --> 32:31.598
- What made you think that?
- Because when we went

32:31.600 --> 32:33.977
to where he said
the bodies were buried...

32:36.062 --> 32:37.837
there was nothing there
that we could really use.

32:37.839 --> 32:40.006
They were in such
an advanced state of decay...

32:40.008 --> 32:41.774
That you were back to where you started.

32:41.776 --> 32:44.225
Worse. It was worse.

32:44.227 --> 32:45.210
When we started,

32:45.212 --> 32:46.579
we thought we could make a case, but

32:46.581 --> 32:48.114
now it was...

32:48.617 --> 32:49.882
It's impossible.

32:49.884 --> 32:51.751
So you went back to the apartment

32:51.753 --> 32:53.219
one last time.

32:53.221 --> 32:55.288
Did anyone go with you?

32:55.290 --> 32:56.789
No.

32:56.791 --> 32:59.859
I, uh, specifically wanted to go alone.

32:59.861 --> 33:01.160
Why?

33:01.162 --> 33:04.216
I... thought that maybe...

33:05.133 --> 33:06.343
I don't know,

33:07.260 --> 33:09.012
I would feel something.

33:09.671 --> 33:11.598
A direction to go in.

33:13.575 --> 33:16.642
You're Catholic, aren't you, Mr. Colón?

33:19.456 --> 33:20.266
I am.

33:20.268 --> 33:21.280
When you went

33:21.282 --> 33:24.784
back to the apartment, did you pray?

33:24.786 --> 33:26.219
I would like to know, Your Honor,

33:26.221 --> 33:27.954
where the defense
is getting her information.

33:27.956 --> 33:30.223
- She's humanizing him.
- Or trying.

33:30.225 --> 33:32.065
...that was suppressed
and stricken from the record.

33:32.067 --> 33:34.193
Your Honor, isn't the real question

33:34.195 --> 33:37.096
not where I got my information
but whether it's true?

33:37.098 --> 33:38.131
Mr. Janson was there.

33:38.133 --> 33:40.500
None of this is news to him.

33:41.378 --> 33:43.402
You may proceed, Counselor.

33:48.042 --> 33:50.743
Did you pray, Mr. Colón?

33:51.054 --> 33:52.639
Started to.

33:54.391 --> 33:56.582
I got on my knees, but

33:56.584 --> 33:58.184
before I could start, I saw

33:58.186 --> 34:00.286
a glint under the sofa.

34:00.288 --> 34:01.654
Stopped what I was doing

34:01.656 --> 34:03.523
and put on my gloves
and reached underneath.

34:03.525 --> 34:06.325
Did you think
it was a miracle, Mr. Colón?

34:06.327 --> 34:08.737
I didn't know what to think. I...

34:10.072 --> 34:12.899
I didn't know if it belonged
to the girls, to him. I...

34:12.900 --> 34:17.103
It was a hard contact lens, and
it was in pretty awful shape.

34:17.105 --> 34:20.572
I thought... let's give it to the lab.

34:20.574 --> 34:23.253
We had everything
to gain and nothing to lose.

34:25.589 --> 34:27.679
I have no further questions, Your Honor.

34:27.681 --> 34:30.116
Let's pick up from here tomorrow.

34:30.118 --> 34:31.636
That girl is good.

34:39.159 --> 34:41.803
- Tell me about our jury.
- Pretty amazing.

34:41.804 --> 34:44.384
You took them on an attitudinal
roller coaster ride.

34:44.416 --> 34:46.304
And that's a good thing, right?

34:46.306 --> 34:47.384
It's good.

34:47.386 --> 34:49.500
The question is, is it good enough?

34:49.502 --> 34:51.722
The jury is surprisingly unanimous

34:51.724 --> 34:53.223
in its attitude towards Benny.

34:53.225 --> 34:55.058
Coming into this thing,

34:55.060 --> 34:56.728
they were convinced he was a bad guy

34:56.731 --> 34:58.595
- and guilty.
- And now?

34:58.597 --> 34:59.788
They're not convinced.

34:59.790 --> 35:02.466
What we really want, what we really need

35:02.468 --> 35:05.402
is for them to be convinced
of his innocence.

35:05.404 --> 35:09.106
Hard to do without offering up
a guilty party in his stead.

35:09.108 --> 35:12.320
I was sort of hoping you would
tell me the defense could rest.

35:12.321 --> 35:15.152
You could, but we want
an acquittal, not a hung jury.

35:15.154 --> 35:18.755
And while there are unanimous
good feelings towards Benny,

35:18.757 --> 35:22.659
there's not unanimity about
what he's been accused of doing.

35:23.021 --> 35:23.961
What do you mean?

35:23.963 --> 35:25.540
How is that even possible?

35:25.542 --> 35:28.332
Well, for instance, these three
guys here have come to believe

35:28.334 --> 35:30.567
that Benny is a good man.

35:30.569 --> 35:32.035
And because he is a good man,

35:32.037 --> 35:33.503
he could have planted that evidence

35:33.505 --> 35:35.572
to prevent another killing.

35:35.574 --> 35:36.874
Huh.

35:36.876 --> 35:38.876
Where'd you get those transcripts?

35:39.778 --> 35:41.912
The documents,
all that stuff you used today.

35:41.914 --> 35:45.561
Me praying, Hayden Watkins'
confession, the interviews.

35:46.061 --> 35:47.784
That was all under seal.
How'd you get that?

35:47.786 --> 35:49.253
What does it matter?

35:49.255 --> 35:51.421
And you're very welcome, Mr. Colón.

35:51.423 --> 35:53.156
I want to know where you got that stuff.

35:53.843 --> 35:55.893
I'm your client
and I have the right to know.

35:55.895 --> 35:57.961
No, you're not my client.

35:57.963 --> 36:00.459
He's my client. You're my defendant.

36:00.461 --> 36:02.314
And I'll tell you what you need to know

36:02.316 --> 36:03.533
and when you need to know it.

36:03.535 --> 36:04.768
What's with the attitude, Benny?

36:04.770 --> 36:06.937
She's working like hell
to save your skin.

36:06.939 --> 36:08.405
What does it matter how she does it?

36:08.407 --> 36:10.140
'Cause I'm starting to question
what side she's on.

36:10.142 --> 36:12.562
Someone gave her that material.

36:12.564 --> 36:14.488
And there's got to be a reason why.

36:14.490 --> 36:16.446
J.P.?

36:19.451 --> 36:21.618
You should feel free to hire new counsel

36:21.620 --> 36:24.655
if you're dissatisfied
with what I'm doing.

36:25.291 --> 36:27.391
And if you don't trust me.

36:27.393 --> 36:30.193
Hmm. Well...

36:30.672 --> 36:34.384
we all know what way you'll vote, Bull.

36:35.176 --> 36:37.134
We can see it
every time you look at her.

36:39.072 --> 36:40.737
Fine. It's your money.

36:40.739 --> 36:42.940
See you in court tomorrow.

36:45.437 --> 36:47.177
Back to work, everybody.

36:49.181 --> 36:50.580
Where does that leave us?

36:50.582 --> 36:52.716
Well, clearly,

36:52.718 --> 36:54.751
you have to stop looking at me.

36:54.753 --> 36:55.953
I mean, with the case.

36:55.955 --> 36:57.654
Pretty clear what has to be done.

36:57.656 --> 37:00.223
Just a question of whether I can do it.

37:00.225 --> 37:01.258
Not for me.

37:01.260 --> 37:03.327
And by the way, I look
at every female lawyer

37:03.329 --> 37:05.629
who owns her own firm and
has offices in three states

37:05.631 --> 37:07.731
exactly the same way.

37:07.733 --> 37:09.333
I'll bet you do.

37:10.002 --> 37:11.501
I'll bet you do.

37:13.072 --> 37:14.204
Call your next witness, please.

37:14.206 --> 37:16.807
The defense calls Inspector
General Wilson Jessup,

37:16.809 --> 37:18.008
Your Honor.

37:27.052 --> 37:28.852
<i>Mr. Jessup,</i>

37:28.854 --> 37:31.922
will you tell the jury
what it is you do for a living?

37:31.924 --> 37:34.656
I'm the inspector general
for the northeast region

37:34.658 --> 37:36.860
of the United States
Department of Justice.

37:36.862 --> 37:38.822
Wow, that sounds like a big job.

37:38.824 --> 37:41.098
I wake up every day amazed I have it

37:41.100 --> 37:42.532
and thankful for the opportunity.

37:44.403 --> 37:47.170
But that wasn't your job
during that summer

37:47.172 --> 37:49.940
almost ten years ago when
the city was being terrorized

37:49.942 --> 37:51.550
by the Socialite Slayer.

37:51.552 --> 37:53.342
No, ma'am, I was a detective

37:53.344 --> 37:55.250
for the New York City Police Department.

37:55.252 --> 37:56.847
And what was that like?

37:56.849 --> 38:00.283
I mean, being in the center
of such a notorious case?

38:00.285 --> 38:01.852
It was frustrating.

38:01.854 --> 38:03.787
Uh, there was a lot of pressure,

38:03.789 --> 38:06.353
virtually no solid evidence
like Benny...

38:06.355 --> 38:08.593
uh, Mr. Colón... said.

38:08.595 --> 38:10.230
Hmm.

38:11.106 --> 38:12.829
It must have really killed you.

38:12.831 --> 38:14.798
And you were already
a highly decorated officer.

38:14.800 --> 38:17.634
People were whispering in your ear about

38:17.636 --> 38:20.270
maybe becoming chief,
even running for office.

38:20.272 --> 38:21.872
I didn't listen to any of that stuff.

38:23.075 --> 38:25.842
You really like Benny...

38:25.844 --> 38:28.678
Mr. Colón, don't you?

38:35.088 --> 38:36.820
I do, actually, yes.

38:36.822 --> 38:39.022
I'd like to enter into evidence
this newly released

38:39.024 --> 38:41.558
analysis from the Rectitude Project.

38:41.560 --> 38:44.127
It's their report on evidence recovered

38:44.129 --> 38:47.064
from Tinsley Browning's contact lens.

38:47.066 --> 38:49.366
I asked them to do some more work on it.

38:49.368 --> 38:51.868
See if they could identify anyone else

38:51.870 --> 38:54.971
who might have come into
contact with that lens.

38:54.973 --> 38:58.208
Would you be interested
in hazarding a guess

38:58.210 --> 38:59.480
what they found,

38:59.482 --> 39:01.311
Mr. Jessup?

39:03.867 --> 39:07.495
I was trying to help
your client, young lady.

39:08.353 --> 39:09.820
I was trying to help Benny.

39:10.248 --> 39:12.292
We don't have to go here.

39:13.659 --> 39:15.559
I gave you those files.

39:15.561 --> 39:17.828
I put myself at risk.

39:17.830 --> 39:21.342
I think you have enough
to do what you need to do.

39:23.569 --> 39:25.805
I'm sorry, Mr. Jessup.

39:26.605 --> 39:28.338
Some people, whose work

39:28.340 --> 39:29.906
I respect a great deal,

39:29.908 --> 39:31.394
say that I don't.

39:32.144 --> 39:33.577
Mr. Jessup, I'm not sure

39:33.579 --> 39:35.045
you've answered counsel's question.

39:35.047 --> 39:36.012
Counsel?

39:36.014 --> 39:38.234
Would you be surprised to hear

39:38.817 --> 39:43.120
that your DNA, your fingerprints
were on that lens?

39:45.424 --> 39:46.923
Mr. Jessup?

39:57.469 --> 39:59.669
That young detective.

40:01.740 --> 40:03.673
He screwed this case.

40:06.445 --> 40:07.878
He punched him.

40:09.057 --> 40:10.948
Punched that monster right in the jaw,

40:10.950 --> 40:13.186
on video.

40:13.886 --> 40:16.153
Might as well have hand-delivered him

40:16.155 --> 40:17.754
another victim to kill.

40:17.756 --> 40:20.090
I went out to the landfill.

40:20.092 --> 40:23.493
I-I had no idea what I was thinking.

40:23.495 --> 40:24.989
I was desperate.

40:26.832 --> 40:30.700
And then... I'm standing there,

40:31.120 --> 40:34.137
looking down at this
naked girl's decaying skull.

40:35.208 --> 40:36.339
And that's when I saw it.

40:36.341 --> 40:37.741
Uh, what did Benny call it?

40:37.743 --> 40:39.109
A-A glint?

40:40.679 --> 40:41.912
<i>I thought, This is it.</i>

40:41.914 --> 40:43.346
<i>There is a God.</i>

40:43.348 --> 40:46.750
<i>We are gonna be able
to put this animal away.â</i>

40:46.752 --> 40:49.786
<i>So I put on my glove, and...</i>

40:53.692 --> 40:56.826
But God had other plans.

41:00.616 --> 41:02.165
I went back to the suspect's apartment

41:02.167 --> 41:03.533
and put it under his couch.

41:03.535 --> 41:05.168
Figured I'd come back with a whole team

41:05.170 --> 41:06.836
and we'd all find it together.

41:06.838 --> 41:08.171
But then Benny

41:08.173 --> 41:11.174
went back out there before me.

41:11.176 --> 41:12.576
All by himself.

41:12.578 --> 41:14.644
And what did that do to your plans?

41:14.646 --> 41:17.847
It actually made it better.

41:17.849 --> 41:20.295
More degrees of separation.

41:22.521 --> 41:26.356
And then, when it came back
three out of five DNA markers

41:26.358 --> 41:28.658
and they said it was a probable match,

41:28.660 --> 41:31.861
I thought... I hit the jackpot.

41:31.863 --> 41:33.808
I won the lottery.â

41:35.000 --> 41:37.133
Talk about dodging a bullet.

41:39.004 --> 41:40.503
Little did I know.

41:47.045 --> 41:49.240
I'm sorry, Benny.

41:54.152 --> 41:56.686
I wish you had taken the deal.

42:06.591 --> 42:08.398
Let's recess for ten minutes

42:08.400 --> 42:09.833
and then reconvene.

42:24.349 --> 42:26.316
They didn't even put
your name in the headline.

42:26.318 --> 42:27.951
I'd sue.

42:28.787 --> 42:30.320
You're a great boss.

42:30.322 --> 42:32.956
I think you're just saying that
'cause I saved your ass

42:32.958 --> 42:33.957
and you're drinking.

42:36.595 --> 42:39.787
I sent, uh, flowers to your lady friend.

42:39.789 --> 42:41.731
You're way off base on this one.

42:41.733 --> 42:43.033
She means nothing to me.

42:43.035 --> 42:44.670
Less than nothing.

42:44.970 --> 42:46.652
- Nuh.
- Mm.

42:48.407 --> 42:50.674
I thanked her, I apologized,

42:50.676 --> 42:52.108
I haven't heard a word.

42:52.553 --> 42:54.244
Oh, you will.

42:54.246 --> 42:56.479
She is not out of our lives.
